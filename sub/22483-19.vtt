♪ ♪

00:07.959 --> 00:09.500
Yeah, well, we got all

00:07.959 --> 00:09.500
the dinner fixings.

00:09.583 --> 00:11.542
You want to cook

00:09.583 --> 00:11.542
at your place or mine?

00:11.625 --> 00:15.041
Hmm. Well, your place has a pot

00:11.625 --> 00:15.041
holder and a broken toaster,

00:15.125 --> 00:18.000
and mine has a bipolar

00:15.125 --> 00:18.000
roommate who wants to kill me.

00:18.083 --> 00:19.667
Let's go out.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.583
(gasps) Wait. Greg.

00:21.667 --> 00:24.000
Look. My dream house.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.792
It's for sale.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.208
Well, we should go inside.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.375
What? No. We can't just go in.

00:29.458 --> 00:32.000
They'll know we're not,

00:29.458 --> 00:32.000
like, house hunters.

00:32.083 --> 00:35.792
Well, I wasn't a black belt when

00:32.083 --> 00:35.792
I walked into that karate dojo.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.625
But look at me now--

00:35.875 --> 00:38.625
I'm a yellow belt.

00:38.709 --> 00:40.208
All right, let's do it.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.625
And if we get attacked by

00:40.291 --> 00:42.625
a piece of scored wood,

00:42.709 --> 00:46.083
I know you'll save me

00:42.709 --> 00:46.083
on your second try.

00:46.166 --> 00:49.333
JEN (gasps):

00:46.166 --> 00:49.333
Oh, my God,

00:49.417 --> 00:50.875
it's perfect.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.667
Look, Greg-- a fireplace

00:50.959 --> 00:53.667
that we'll never use.

00:53.750 --> 00:54.959
(chuckles)

00:55.041 --> 00:56.208
Eh? No, I like it.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.125
You know, it's got

00:56.291 --> 00:58.125
a lot of nooks.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.750
-Mm-hmm.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.750
-I'm a big nook guy.

00:59.834 --> 01:02.375
Oh, man. Well,

00:59.834 --> 01:02.375
too bad we're years away

01:02.458 --> 01:04.333
from making a move like this.

01:04.417 --> 01:06.291
Well, I mean, I don't know,

01:04.417 --> 01:06.291
if we pooled our money together,

01:06.375 --> 01:07.834
I'm sure we could afford

01:06.375 --> 01:07.834
a down payment.

01:07.917 --> 01:09.625
Yeah, but we're just dating.

01:09.709 --> 01:11.583
I know we've been together

01:09.709 --> 01:11.583
for a year, but...

01:11.667 --> 01:13.750
I mean, aren't there,

01:11.667 --> 01:13.750
like, three more steps

01:13.834 --> 01:15.625
-before buying a house?

01:13.834 --> 01:15.625
-Well, yeah,

01:15.709 --> 01:16.917
if you follow the rules.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.583
But you know me--

01:17.000 --> 01:18.583
I'm a rule breaker.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.041
You saw me-- I used the ladies'

01:18.667 --> 01:21.041
room at the farmers market.

01:21.125 --> 01:23.333
If you want something bad

01:21.125 --> 01:23.333
enough, you got to go for it.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.959
So are-are we actually

01:23.417 --> 01:26.959
considering this?

01:27.041 --> 01:28.917
I don't know. Are we?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.542
-Let's say it at the same time.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.542
-Okay.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.166
-Ready? One, two, three.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.166
-One, two, three.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.542
-Let's do it.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.542
-Yes. (gasps)

01:34.750 --> 01:36.917
-(laughing)

01:34.750 --> 01:36.917
-Don't you love it?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.458
-We do. (laughs)

01:37.000 --> 01:38.458
-Yeah.

01:38.542 --> 01:40.583
We've been getting a lot

01:38.542 --> 01:40.583
of offers, but the owners

01:40.667 --> 01:43.291
only want to sell to a young

01:40.667 --> 01:43.291
married couple like you.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.458
Oh, we're not married.

01:45.542 --> 01:48.500
No, but-but-but-but

01:45.542 --> 01:48.500
we are engaged.

01:48.583 --> 01:49.834
Right, Greg?

01:50.834 --> 01:52.000
-Yes, Jen.

01:50.834 --> 01:52.000
-Yes.

01:52.083 --> 01:53.250
-We are.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.291
We are engaged

01:53.333 --> 01:55.291
to be a married couple,

01:55.375 --> 01:57.709
and we would like

01:55.375 --> 01:57.709
to buy this home.

01:57.792 --> 01:59.625
Jen, checkbook, please?

01:59.709 --> 02:01.291
Yeah, that's not

01:59.709 --> 02:01.291
the way it works, Greg.

02:01.375 --> 02:02.667
Okay.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.792
Okay, so we have 30 minutes

02:04.875 --> 02:07.125
to convince the owners we're

02:04.875 --> 02:07.125
the right buyers for this house.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.000
That gives us some time

02:07.208 --> 02:09.000
to work on our characters.

02:09.083 --> 02:10.625
<i>Or... </i>or, or...

02:10.709 --> 02:12.583
we're just engaged.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.166
-Okay.
-Do you have the ring?

02:14.250 --> 02:15.500
I do.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.125
Ooh.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.750
Wow!

02:18.834 --> 02:20.667
Ooh, it's so pretty.

02:20.750 --> 02:23.125
It's just a crappy little
thing that I picked up

02:23.208 --> 02:25.500
at the farmers market while
you were stealing grapes.

02:25.583 --> 02:27.125
I wasn't stealing.
I was sampling the grapes.

02:27.208 --> 02:29.500
You know, they want you
to do that so you buy them.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.083
-Yeah, but you didn't buy them.
-Well, no, I was too full

02:29.583 --> 02:33.083
of grapes.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.041
Okay, here are the owners.
Turn on the charm

02:35.125 --> 02:36.875
-and speak loudly.
-Okay.

02:36.959 --> 02:38.542
Hi.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.000
-Hi.
-Are you two newlyweds looking

02:38.625 --> 02:41.000
at this house, too?

02:41.083 --> 02:42.125
(Jen laughing)

02:42.208 --> 02:44.166
You must be Jerry and Marlene.

02:44.250 --> 02:47.083
We just put an offer in
on your beautiful home.

02:47.166 --> 02:51.333
We are the happily engaged
couple, Greg and Jen.

02:51.417 --> 02:53.417
Oh, my, what a stunner.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.792
Me or the ring?

02:54.875 --> 02:55.917
(laughter)

02:56.959 --> 02:59.709
You know, we built
this house in 1958

02:59.792 --> 03:01.458
when <i>we </i>were newlyweds.

03:01.542 --> 03:02.667
MARLENE:
And back then,

03:02.750 --> 03:04.750
the street was dirt.

03:04.834 --> 03:07.000
What? Can you imagine? Dirt?

03:07.083 --> 03:09.333
Our nation's greatest
natural resource.

03:09.417 --> 03:10.625
(chuckles):
Oh.

03:10.709 --> 03:13.417
I have a good feeling
about these two.

03:13.500 --> 03:14.917
MARLENE:
Yes, I do, too.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.250
Maybe it's because
I've always wanted

03:17.333 --> 03:19.709
to sell our home
to two nice young Lutherans.

03:19.792 --> 03:20.834
(chuckles)

03:22.834 --> 03:25.208
JEN:
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

03:22.834 --> 03:25.208
<i>We got our house.</i>

03:25.291 --> 03:27.375
<i>And </i>we can stop pretending
to be engaged.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.792
Although it was fun.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.667
Well, who says
that the fun has to end?

03:31.750 --> 03:32.792
Hmm?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.792
We may have been pretending,

03:34.875 --> 03:39.125
but I've been wanting it to be
real since the day I met you.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.166
You make me so happy,

03:41.250 --> 03:43.041
and I love you so much.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.083
So here we go.

03:46.041 --> 03:48.250
Greg, what is happening?

03:48.333 --> 03:51.208
This house
is just the beginning...

03:51.291 --> 03:54.458
'cause I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

03:56.041 --> 03:59.875
Jennifer Jason Collins...
will you marry me?

03:59.959 --> 04:02.417
Oh, my gosh. (sniffles)

04:03.792 --> 04:05.709
Where is it?

04:05.792 --> 04:07.166
That's the best part.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.458
You already have the ring.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.834
What?

04:10.917 --> 04:13.542
The fake ring that I gave you,
it's the real thing.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.875
Well, b-but I thought
that was fake,

04:16.959 --> 04:18.583
and I threw it away.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.458
-You what?
-I threw it out. I threw it out,

04:21.542 --> 04:22.792
because you told me
that it was just a crappy ring

04:22.875 --> 04:24.166
from the farmers market, so...

04:24.250 --> 04:25.500
-Oh, no. Oh, no.
-Wow. Wow.

04:25.583 --> 04:27.542
-Why would you do that?
-Aah! Is it trash day?

04:27.625 --> 04:28.750
I don't know if it's trash day.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.291
How am I supposed to know
if it's trash day?

04:30.375 --> 04:31.500
I just moved into
the neighborhood.

04:31.583 --> 04:34.083
Oh, Greg. Go! Go, go, go!

04:37.583 --> 04:39.208
Well, according
to the paperwork,

04:39.291 --> 04:42.750
there were no other offers
and we overpaid by a mile.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.917
-Ooh! I found it! (gasps)
-Oh!

04:45.000 --> 04:45.959
(laughs)

04:46.041 --> 04:47.291
Oh.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.500
Oh, Greg, it's beautiful.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.583
You didn't give me
an answer before.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.250
All right. But I need
you to make it quick,

04:54.333 --> 04:56.959
'cause I don't know
what I'm kneeling in.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.083
Will you marry me?

04:58.166 --> 04:59.291
-(laughs): Yes.
-Yeah?

04:59.375 --> 05:00.542
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:02.125 --> 05:04.333
-GREG: Oh!
-(laughing)

05:05.542 --> 05:07.625
-Uh-oh. Oh. Oh, no.
-Yeah, ooh, here.

05:07.709 --> 05:10.875
-Oh, that doesn't smell right.
-No, it doesn't.

05:14.417 --> 05:15.834
It's a blind date,

05:15.917 --> 05:17.500
so I don't know how much

05:15.917 --> 05:17.500
she knows about me.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.500
So, do I admit
to being divorced?

05:19.583 --> 05:21.959
Do-do I tell her
I have a mustache?

05:22.041 --> 05:24.375
Well, she's not <i>really </i>blind.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.458
Uh, excuse me.

05:25.542 --> 05:26.583
Um, I need a double order

05:26.667 --> 05:28.417
-of wings to go.
-Okay.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.542
Uh, they're
for my pregnant wife.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.208
She's informed me that
she would like them

05:32.291 --> 05:33.667
"wet yet dry,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.834
"and I don't care
how you accomplish this,

05:35.917 --> 05:38.583
but the chickens
need to be happy."

05:38.667 --> 05:41.000
I can look for the head bag
and see if they're smiling.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.208
Perfect. Thank you.

05:42.291 --> 05:43.250
Yeah.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.125
Oh, hey, that's Colleen.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.375
Is that your date? She's cute.

05:47.458 --> 05:48.959
No, no, no, no, no,
that's my boss.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.542
She didn't approve
my overtime,

05:50.625 --> 05:52.291
but I should probably
still go say hi, right?

05:52.375 --> 05:54.458
Oh, man, if you end up having
a threesome tonight,

05:54.542 --> 05:56.417
I'm gonna be pissed.

05:59.792 --> 06:00.750
Boo!

06:00.834 --> 06:02.000
(gasps) Oh.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.542
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

06:03.625 --> 06:04.792
-I didn't... I-I... Hey, it's...
-Oh. No, no.

06:04.875 --> 06:05.834
I just wanted to come over
and say hi.

06:05.917 --> 06:06.875
I didn't mean to make you cry.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.250
No, I was already crying.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.875
Okay. (chuckles)

06:09.959 --> 06:11.375
-Uh, what's wrong?
-Anything to drink?

06:11.458 --> 06:14.208
Cadillac margarita,
on the rocks.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.625
I just found out that my fiancé
committed tax fraud.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.291
Salt on half the rim,

06:18.375 --> 06:20.208
sugar on the other half.
And now I don't know how I will

06:20.291 --> 06:22.208
ever trust him again.
Three pumps of strawberry.

06:22.291 --> 06:24.125
And I don't know if
I should marry him now, so...

06:25.125 --> 06:27.000
That part was for you.

06:27.083 --> 06:28.041
Wow.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.917
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Uh,

06:30.000 --> 06:31.125
you're not sure
if you're gonna get married...

06:31.208 --> 06:32.875
-No.
-Um, I'm so sorry.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.959
(sighs) Yeah, well, I'm fine.

06:35.750 --> 06:36.917
No, I'm not.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.875
But I'm getting
a very large margarita

06:38.959 --> 06:40.709
that I can just lower
my face into.

06:40.792 --> 06:42.709
Um...

06:42.792 --> 06:44.250
I'll be back in a second.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.917
Okay. (chuckles, sniffles)

06:47.000 --> 06:48.208
Hey, man. Hey.

06:48.291 --> 06:49.959
Colleen could really use
a friend right now.

06:50.041 --> 06:52.542
So, um, could you tell my date
that I couldn't make it?

06:52.625 --> 06:54.041
Are you serious?
It's been ten minutes.

06:54.125 --> 06:55.458
You're already juggling
two women?

06:55.542 --> 06:57.041
This always happens.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.458
Please, dude. Look at her.

06:58.542 --> 06:59.875
-COLLEEN: Spank you.
-Yeah.

06:59.959 --> 07:01.125
Uh, I don't...
I don't need this.

07:01.208 --> 07:03.166
Oh, no, you have
to keep both straws.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.041
Legally, I'm not allowed
to serve this to one person.

07:06.125 --> 07:09.333
Yeah, okay, fine. But if you
ever make any money, you owe me.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.000
Thanks, man. Hey,
her name is Lindsay.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.083
She's right over there.
And her name may be Lily.

07:16.750 --> 07:17.875
Hi. Are you...?

07:17.959 --> 07:18.959
Lindsay. Hi.

07:19.041 --> 07:20.583
(chuckles) You must be Matt.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.834
-Well, uh, funny thing, um...
-I'm so glad

07:22.917 --> 07:25.583
you showed up. I can't tell you
how many blind dates I've had

07:25.667 --> 07:27.667
where the guy cancels
at the last minute.

07:27.750 --> 07:31.625
(chuckles)
Well, you don't have anything...

07:31.709 --> 07:34.500
to fear, because...

07:34.583 --> 07:36.458
Matt Short is here. So,

07:36.542 --> 07:38.125
uh, art.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.834
Have you heard of it?

07:39.917 --> 07:43.375
I can't believe I'm engaged
to a criminal and a liar.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.375
I invested five years
of my life in Chad,

07:45.458 --> 07:47.625
and now I'm in my 30s.
You know what that means.

07:47.709 --> 07:50.208
Um, yeah,
that you finally floss regularly

07:50.291 --> 07:51.917
and you own your orgasms?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.333
No. It means I-I can't afford
to throw it all away

07:54.417 --> 07:57.834
and start over. And now I feel
guilty about not flossing.

07:57.917 --> 08:01.291
Lindsay, you seem like
a really fantastic person,

08:01.375 --> 08:04.291
but I think you deserve a much
better guy than me, all right?

08:04.375 --> 08:07.792
So I-I think it's best
if-if you just move on.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.417
Matt, we've only been talking
for, like, two minutes.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, uh, but I'm just trying
to be up-front here, okay?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.500
I have no money.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.375
Finally.
A guy who can be honest.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.208
No, no, I-I'm...
I am just trying to tell you

08:20.291 --> 08:21.959
I am a bad bet.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.792
Well, maybe I have
a gambling problem.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.208
How is this working?

08:27.291 --> 08:29.041
I didn't expect to have
to start over in my 30s.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.625
Eight months ago, I was sitting
exactly where you are.

08:31.709 --> 08:33.709
Except I wasn't sitting in front

08:33.792 --> 08:35.458
of a kiddie pool full of liquor.

08:35.542 --> 08:37.000
It's helping.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.667
So, what am I supposed to do?

08:38.750 --> 08:40.667
Start over again
with someone new?

08:40.750 --> 08:43.709
Pretend I'm some cool girl
who doesn't cry

08:43.792 --> 08:45.709
and likes to talk sports ball?

08:45.792 --> 08:47.458
Well, you're 0 for 2.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.917
Double order of wings to go?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.917
Yeah, right here.

08:53.000 --> 08:53.959
Whoa.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.333
To go, huh?

08:56.417 --> 08:57.959
Cocky. Me likey.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.000
-Uh...
-JEN: Hey.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.375
What are you doing?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.792
Who is this woman?

09:04.875 --> 09:06.959
And where are my wings?

09:07.041 --> 09:08.000
Your wings are right here.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.417
And-and-and-and
this woman is...

09:11.500 --> 09:13.792
my date.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.333
You eat any of those wings?

09:18.875 --> 09:21.208
Okay, then we're good.

09:25.166 --> 09:28.875
Things are gonna get much easier
once she has the baby.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.083
No,
I don't think you should pretend

09:30.166 --> 09:31.250
like you're somebody else,

09:31.333 --> 09:32.583
'cause I think you're great.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.959
You're just saying that
because you work for me.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.208
-With you.
-I could fire you.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.875
Yeah, but you'd need
the supervisor's approval.

09:38.959 --> 09:41.041
But I could get it. I mean,
he has a crush on me, so...

09:41.125 --> 09:42.625
Oh, well, there you go.

09:42.709 --> 09:44.750
(chuckles)
Matt, he's disgusting.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.750
-Well...
-He drinks salad dressing

09:44.834 --> 09:47.750
out of the bottle.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.667
Look, I wouldn't worry
about it, okay?

09:49.750 --> 09:53.333
You're gonna find somebody who
realizes that you are a catch.

09:53.417 --> 09:55.917
-(scoffs)
-And isn't gonna want

09:53.417 --> 09:55.917
to risk prison time

09:56.000 --> 09:58.750
-because that would mean
being apart from you.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.750
-Aw.

09:58.834 --> 10:01.166
Okay, maybe I won't fire you.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.458
-Oh, thank you.
-(chuckles)

10:02.542 --> 10:04.291
All right, so here.

10:04.375 --> 10:08.208
Here is to each of us finding
what we're looking for.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.750
I hope it's out there.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.083
I know it is.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.250
(clears throat)
Can you help me with this?

10:14.333 --> 10:16.083
Oh. Yeah, sure.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.875
I meant lifting it,
like, to cheers,

10:17.959 --> 10:18.917
but, you know, that's fine, too.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.625
Just drink up.

10:30.041 --> 10:33.125
So, you came home from college

10:30.041 --> 10:33.125
with your laundry and a boy.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.750
-(chuckles)

10:33.208 --> 10:35.750
-At least one of them is clean.

10:35.834 --> 10:37.250
Oh, no, no, no.
He is. He is, Mom.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.750
We just got our tests
back yesterday, so...

10:38.834 --> 10:40.417
Good.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.083
-So awesome
to meet you guys finally.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.083
-Yeah.

10:42.166 --> 10:44.625
How long you guys been dating?

10:44.709 --> 10:46.875
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
What, Tim, about two months?

10:46.959 --> 10:49.667
-Yeah, I guess it really depends
on when you're counting.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.667
-Yeah.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.667
From when we first, you know,

10:51.750 --> 10:52.709
or when we first...

10:52.792 --> 10:54.291
(laughing):
Yeah, we're...

10:54.375 --> 10:57.417
Okay, so either two months
or two months and a day.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.417
So, you're in med school, Tim?

10:59.500 --> 11:00.458
Yeah.

11:00.542 --> 11:01.625
That must be nice.

11:01.709 --> 11:04.750
'Cause you get to do
all that mouth-to-mouth.

11:04.834 --> 11:06.333
Yeah, no, I-I've pretty much
just been working

11:06.417 --> 11:08.542
with my cadaver so far.
So, not that much.

11:08.625 --> 11:12.125
But, uh, I did slip once,
and my lips touched her face.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.917
So that's kind of a kiss.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.041
He's funny. He's very funny.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.458
Technically,
I did break her heart,

11:16.542 --> 11:17.959
-but that's
a whole nother story.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.959
-Yeah.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.208
Well, as long as you don't
break my daughter's heart.

11:20.291 --> 11:21.250
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that.

11:21.333 --> 11:22.750
I've learned my lesson. Yeah.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.583
-Yeah.
-Heart may feel

11:22.834 --> 11:24.583
like a tennis ball,

11:24.667 --> 11:26.041
but it doesn't bounce
like one.

11:26.125 --> 11:28.709
That is sick. I like this guy.
(chuckles)

11:28.792 --> 11:31.375
Oh, thank you.
I like you, too, Mr. Short.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.875
Please, call me John.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.875
HEATHER:
<i>Hey, Mom,</i>

11:37.959 --> 11:39.583
what do you think of Tim?

11:39.667 --> 11:40.792
Oh, I like him.

11:40.875 --> 11:41.834
(chuckles)

11:41.917 --> 11:43.500
Yeah, he's happy, he's loyal,

11:43.583 --> 11:45.000
he loves to run.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.500
He's like our old dog Jeff.

11:47.583 --> 11:48.583
Oh, good.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.500
Yeah, because I'm pregnant.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.583
-What?
-Yeah.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.375
You let that animal
get you pregnant?

11:54.458 --> 11:55.417
Mom!

11:55.500 --> 11:57.792
What about school and work

11:57.875 --> 11:59.041
and your career?

11:59.125 --> 12:01.500
Oh, honey, you're way too young.

12:01.583 --> 12:02.917
I know, I know,
but there are a lot

12:03.000 --> 12:05.166
of young working moms nowadays.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.500
You know, people say
that this Internet thing

12:07.583 --> 12:09.000
is gonna just take right off,

12:09.083 --> 12:10.959
and then we'll be able
to work from home.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.792
How can you be a Supreme Court
justice from home?

12:13.875 --> 12:16.291
The Internet! I don't know!

12:16.375 --> 12:17.625
(stammers)

12:17.709 --> 12:19.333
I didn't do this on purpose,
okay?

12:19.417 --> 12:21.417
Well, what does Tim say?

12:21.500 --> 12:25.333
Yeah, I'm, um, trying to find
the right time to tell him.

12:25.417 --> 12:26.417
He doesn't know yet?

12:26.500 --> 12:28.000
No, but I think that I love him,

12:28.083 --> 12:29.709
and I know he'll be a good dad.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.625
Oh, listen, honey,
he-he may look 40,

12:32.709 --> 12:35.834
but, believe me, boys his age
don't want to be a dad.

12:35.917 --> 12:38.291
Who doesn't want to be a dad?
I mean, aside from our dad.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.208
Tim, and it's none
of your business.

12:40.291 --> 12:41.250
Mom!

12:41.333 --> 12:42.667
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.542
Just forget that I said that.

12:44.625 --> 12:47.417
But ask your sister if she's
gotten her period lately.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.458
Mom!

12:48.542 --> 12:50.458
-Gross.
-You're pregnant?!

12:50.542 --> 12:52.166
Shut up. Okay?

12:52.250 --> 12:53.834
Tim doesn't know.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.542
You guys like him. Right?

12:55.625 --> 12:56.583
Not anymore.

12:56.667 --> 12:57.625
-(scoffs)
-Yeah, I mean,

12:57.709 --> 12:58.667
he was all right when he was

12:58.750 --> 12:59.917
just some random medical student

13:00.000 --> 13:01.500
who's got cool cadaver stories.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.750
But now that I know that
you guys did it, that is nasty.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.583
What does that even feel like?

13:05.667 --> 13:07.750
Probably pretty good, right?

13:07.834 --> 13:09.625
I can't believe you guys.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.458
Do you even know what kind
of doctor you're gonna be?

13:15.542 --> 13:17.792
I figure I'd just flip a coin.
Heads or tails, you know?

13:17.875 --> 13:19.959
-Brain surgery or proctology.
-Mm.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.583
That's the best thing
about repeating

13:21.667 --> 13:23.333
my first year of med school.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.625
I get a lot of time to decide.

13:25.709 --> 13:26.834
But Heather said

13:26.917 --> 13:28.667
you were top of your class.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.500
Oh, no.
I wear a top hat to class.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.500
It's kind of my trademark.
(laughs)

13:33.583 --> 13:35.959
-(quietly): This guy's a tool.
-Loserville.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.542
-Population: Tim.
-(snickers)

13:38.625 --> 13:40.375
Well, I'm gonna make cocktails
for the men.

13:40.458 --> 13:41.625
Uh, Tim, you want one?

13:41.709 --> 13:44.000
Aw, thanks, Mr. Short.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.667
I told you, call me John.

13:46.750 --> 13:49.875
(laughs) Boy,
he is party time excellent.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.375
Oh, yeah, he's great. When
he's around. Which is never.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.125
You gonna be around
for your kids?

13:54.208 --> 13:56.291
Nah, never really gave it
any thought.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.667
I still got a whole lot of
living to do. I-I could wind up

13:58.750 --> 14:00.500
a Doctor Without Borders.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.291
Or with borders.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.375
-Or just work in a Borders.
I love magazines.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.375
-You know, we,

14:05.458 --> 14:06.542
um, haven't really discussed

14:06.625 --> 14:08.333
-our future yet, so it's...
-Yeah,

14:08.417 --> 14:09.375
why would we?
We're still young.

14:09.458 --> 14:11.125
This is our chance
to be wild and free

14:11.208 --> 14:12.542
and swimming in debt.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.250
Yeah, but, you know,
we've actually been

14:14.333 --> 14:17.375
so wild and free
for the last two months,

14:17.458 --> 14:20.333
and it's a long time,
if you think about it.

14:20.417 --> 14:21.625
I don't know.
Remember that psychic

14:21.709 --> 14:23.959
-said we're all gonna die
in Y2K?

14:21.709 --> 14:23.959
-Yeah.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.750
The psychic was
my sorority sister

14:25.834 --> 14:27.542
with a turban on her head,

14:27.625 --> 14:30.166
so she doesn't really
know anything.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.667
Oh, thank God. She also said

14:31.750 --> 14:33.333
-I was gonna go bald.
-Mm.

14:33.417 --> 14:34.834
I guess the point is,
you just live each day

14:34.917 --> 14:36.333
-like it's your last.
-Yeah.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.500
I mean, well,

14:37.583 --> 14:38.542
not if you're pregnant.

14:38.625 --> 14:40.500
(laughs) Who's pregnant?

14:41.542 --> 14:44.208
I'm pregnant, Tim.

14:48.625 --> 14:51.208
Oh, my gosh.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.000
-(sighs)
-Oh, honey.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.667
-Come here.
-(voice breaking): I'm so

14:54.083 --> 14:55.667
stupid.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.041
No, you're not.
No, you're not. It's okay.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.709
-Your dad and I will help you
raise the baby.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.709
-I know.

15:00.792 --> 15:03.291
I'm gonna be a father.

15:03.375 --> 15:06.041
I'm the luckiest guy
in the world!

15:06.125 --> 15:07.375
You are?

15:07.458 --> 15:09.208
Are you kidding me?
I mean, I'm...

15:09.291 --> 15:11.834
I'm gonna have a baby
with the most amazing woman

15:11.917 --> 15:12.959
I've ever met in my life.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.583
-I love you.
-Oh, I love you, too.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.166
Oh.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.875
Hey, man, hey.

15:19.959 --> 15:21.667
I'm sorry that I said that
you were a hopeless loser

15:21.750 --> 15:23.125
who was better off dead.

15:23.208 --> 15:25.125
-Welcome to the family, man.
-Hey, thanks, man.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.542
-Oh, thank you, Matt.
-I'm sorry I was grossed out

15:26.625 --> 15:27.709
by you guys doing it.

15:27.792 --> 15:29.000
I didn't know it was
to procreate, so...

15:29.083 --> 15:30.125
Me neither. (laughs)

15:30.208 --> 15:32.875
What's everybody
hugging my boy for, huh?

15:32.959 --> 15:34.083
The best news ever.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.750
Heather's pregnant, John.

15:36.792 --> 15:39.417
You call me Mr. Short.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.375
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:

15:46.166 --> 15:47.375
<i>TWA Flight 438,</i>

15:47.458 --> 15:48.542
<i>prepare for final approach.</i>

15:48.625 --> 15:50.166
WYATT:

15:48.625 --> 15:50.166
<i>This has been such an honor.</i>

15:50.250 --> 15:53.834
To be on the last flight
of Captain John Short.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.375
You are a legend.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.041
Is it true you once landed
on a freeway?

15:57.125 --> 15:59.208
Yeah, it's true. I think.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.625
Oh, I was flying high

16:00.709 --> 16:02.875
in a lot of other ways
that year, Wyatt.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.250
Yeah.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.709
Boy, I'm gonna miss it up here.

16:05.792 --> 16:07.500
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
<i>TWA 438,</i>

16:07.583 --> 16:09.792
<i>you're clear to land</i>
<i>two-five left.</i>

16:09.875 --> 16:12.208
Your last landing.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.333
Bring us home, Captain.

16:14.417 --> 16:17.417
(indistinct chatter over radio)

16:17.500 --> 16:20.709
JOHN:
<i>TWA 438, put a hold on that.</i>

16:20.792 --> 16:22.834
We're seeing
a lot of fog up here.

16:22.917 --> 16:24.000
I don't want to risk it.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.917
I don't see any fog.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.333
Yeah, it's out my side.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.375
No...

16:28.458 --> 16:29.667
Sit down, Wyatt.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.333
It's pea soup up here.

16:31.417 --> 16:32.917
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
<i>Captain, we're not seeing</i>

16:31.417 --> 16:32.917
<i>any fog</i>

16:33.000 --> 16:34.709
<i>down here.</i>
<i>You're number one to land.</i>

16:34.792 --> 16:36.959
-Copy that. We are...
-Negative.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.417
Pilot's discretion.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.667
We're doing our go-around.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.041
This flight
is not ready to retire.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.291
You mean land.

16:44.875 --> 16:47.083
All right, we got another pilot
refusing to retire.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.458
Call in the wife
or domestic partner.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.500
It's 2006, people.

16:53.125 --> 16:54.959
-Your father's almost down.
-HEATHER: Oh.

16:55.041 --> 16:56.417
He has no idea

16:56.500 --> 16:57.834
that we're here.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.792
It's gonna be such a surprise.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.458
WOMAN (over P.A.):
<i>Joan Short, please find</i>

17:01.542 --> 17:03.709
<i>the white courtesy telephone</i>
<i>by gate C12.</i>

17:03.792 --> 17:06.041
Damn it!

17:06.125 --> 17:09.041
Approach, you got TWA 438.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.542
Oh, visibility's
still pretty low,

17:11.625 --> 17:14.583
so I'm gonna have
to circle a few more times.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.166
JOAN:
<i>John, what are you doing?</i>

17:16.250 --> 17:18.667
Approach, did I ever tell you

17:18.750 --> 17:20.458
you sound just like my wife?

17:20.542 --> 17:22.041
No, it <i>is </i>me.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.500
<i>It's Joanie.</i>

17:23.583 --> 17:25.417
We're all here to surprise you

17:25.500 --> 17:26.875
for your final flight,

17:26.959 --> 17:29.667
but now they're saying
you refuse to come down.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.875
And we're in 30-minute parking,

17:31.959 --> 17:35.417
and, you know, that gets
very expensive very fast.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.208
I can't hear you through
all this fog, Joanie.

17:38.291 --> 17:42.041
No, dear, the only fog
is between your ears.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.125
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>want to come down?</i>

17:44.208 --> 17:46.834
Because once I'm
grounded, that's it.

17:46.917 --> 17:48.917
What am I gonna do with myself?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.375
You'll spend time
with your family.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.250
But the kids hardly know me.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.834
I mean,
Greg called the mailman "Dad"

17:55.917 --> 17:57.834
for the first ten years
of his life.

17:57.917 --> 18:00.750
That's only because
you both wear blue hats.

18:00.834 --> 18:03.375
<i>But the kids</i>
<i>always looked up to you.</i>

18:03.458 --> 18:06.083
They love you. Here, listen.

18:06.166 --> 18:07.542
Take it, dear.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.208
Hi, Dad. Hi.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.250
<i>Listen, we love you so much.</i>

18:11.333 --> 18:13.542
Okay? And I'm sure
that all the hostages you've...

18:13.625 --> 18:15.500
I-I mean, the-the passengers

18:15.583 --> 18:16.875
that you have up there,

18:16.959 --> 18:19.166
you know, they have families
that love them, too.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.625
So you... Yeah, here's Tim.

18:20.709 --> 18:22.458
Okay? Here.

18:22.542 --> 18:24.000
Hey, John.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.458
It's your good buddy, Tim.

18:25.542 --> 18:26.709
Next.

18:26.792 --> 18:29.458
(laughs)

18:29.542 --> 18:30.792
Said he loves me.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.083
-You're up, Matt.
-HEATHER: Oh.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.709
-Honey.
-Hey, Dad.

18:34.792 --> 18:37.458
<i>You know, we look up to you</i>
<i>for all the little things,</i>

18:37.542 --> 18:40.333
like a low-interest loan that
we can hammer out the details of

18:40.417 --> 18:43.709
as soon as you get down. Okay,
I love you, Daddy. Bye-bye.

18:43.792 --> 18:47.500
"Dad, I wrote a poem
to commemorate this day.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.417
"I'm not really sure
what you're going to say.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.208
"I'm so happy
to have you on the ground.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.875
"And it will be great

18:54.959 --> 18:56.667
for us to pal around."

18:56.750 --> 18:59.250
All right. Read your poem.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.041
Yeah, uh, s-sure.

19:01.125 --> 19:03.500
Um, "Dad,
I wrote a poem to comme..."

19:03.583 --> 19:04.625
<i>Oh, God.</i>

19:04.709 --> 19:06.125
Just put your mother on.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.750
Yeah, okay.

19:08.834 --> 19:10.208
JOAN:
<i>Did that move you, dear?</i>

19:10.291 --> 19:12.208
Well, they're not exactly
making a case

19:12.291 --> 19:13.875
to hang up my wings.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.125
JOHN:
<i>Stewardess.</i>

19:20.208 --> 19:21.500
Get the snack cart.

19:21.583 --> 19:24.041
Looks like Wyatt here
could use some nuts.

19:24.125 --> 19:27.166
You really have to call Tony
a steward now, John.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.083
JOAN:
<i>Johnny, come down to me.</i>

19:30.166 --> 19:32.375
W-We'll start
this new journey together.

19:32.458 --> 19:34.291
I'll be your copilot.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.750
You know, I never thought
about it like that.

19:36.834 --> 19:40.709
I'd actually have a copilot
next to me I wanted to be with.

19:40.792 --> 19:43.834
My dad always said
never meet your heroes.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.458
Captain Short,
you're clear to come in

19:46.542 --> 19:48.333
for many kisses.

19:49.417 --> 19:52.083
Time to land this bird, Wyatt.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.917
I think this bad weather's
behind us.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.959
Uh, really? 'Cause it looks

19:57.041 --> 19:59.917
like we're flying
right into a terrible storm.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.041
Approach TWA 438,
permission to land.

20:02.125 --> 20:03.166
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
<i>Hold off, 438.</i>

20:03.250 --> 20:04.417
<i>Heavy weather's moved in.</i>

20:04.500 --> 20:06.458
<i>I think you may be up there</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

20:06.542 --> 20:08.500
No way. It's time
for me to go home.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.041
Watch and learn, Wyatt.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.000
