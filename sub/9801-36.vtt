19:59.620 --> 20:01.310
-I'm on it, Skipper.

20:01.310 --> 20:02.460
Follow the line.

20:02.460 --> 20:03.170
Follow the line.

20:03.170 --> 20:04.100
Follow the line.

20:04.100 --> 20:04.830
Follow the line.

20:04.830 --> 20:05.530
Follow the line.

20:05.530 --> 20:06.310
Follow the line.

20:06.310 --> 20:07.010
Follow the line.

20:07.010 --> 20:10.150
Follow the-- whoa!

20:10.150 --> 20:11.630
Eek!

20:11.630 --> 20:13.870
I've lost the line.

20:13.870 --> 20:15.740
Where is the line?

20:15.740 --> 20:17.800
-You just crossed it, buddy boy.

20:25.460 --> 20:26.580
-One fish.

20:26.580 --> 20:27.760
Ridiculous.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.840
Let's slap a zero
on that bad boy.

20:31.840 --> 20:32.830
-10 fish?

20:32.830 --> 20:33.870
Well done, Skipper.

20:33.870 --> 20:34.570
-Good.

20:34.570 --> 20:36.650
But it's missing a
little something.

20:36.650 --> 20:39.000
Oh, I know.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.700
-Yay.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.160
-A hundred.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.810
-You've just got to let these
computers know who's boss.

20:47.220 --> 20:49.720
-I was in a tree.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.510
Listen to me computer.

20:52.510 --> 20:53.970
I am the boss.

20:57.050 --> 20:58.200
Hey, guys.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.590
I added 11-teen zeros.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.090
I--

21:02.090 --> 21:05.090
[SCREAMING]

21:06.040 --> 21:06.740
-No, no.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.850
I do not want penguin for lunch.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.100
Gives me the gases.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.290
Perhaps another water bird.

21:12.290 --> 21:15.050
Er, is the beaver fresh today?

21:15.050 --> 21:15.900
-Nothing personal.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.600
You understand.

21:21.260 --> 21:21.960
-Line!

21:21.960 --> 21:24.100
I found you.

21:24.100 --> 21:24.990
-Ah, boys.

21:24.990 --> 21:28.330
It won't be long before
we're hip deep in halibut.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.790
KOWALSKI: Uh, Skipper?

21:30.790 --> 21:33.920
i lost the line for a
while, but I found it again.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.430
Ow.

21:35.430 --> 21:37.340
Hey!

21:37.340 --> 21:40.800
It's raining fish on my head.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.270
-Skipper, I think that
might be more than 100 fish.

21:43.270 --> 21:43.970
-Help!

21:43.970 --> 21:47.420
I-- forgot how to
swim-- in fish.

21:50.370 --> 21:52.740
-Kowalski!

21:52.740 --> 21:53.710
-Hm.

21:53.710 --> 21:55.570
Fish?

21:55.570 --> 21:57.780
Yep, that's fish.

21:57.780 --> 21:58.480
Mm.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.180
I like fish.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.670
They taste nommy.

22:02.670 --> 22:06.690
And they have googly eyes.

22:06.690 --> 22:11.130
And they travel in
schools-- schools.

22:11.130 --> 22:14.570
That's because they're so smart.

22:14.570 --> 22:15.480
No.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.780
That's not right.

22:16.780 --> 22:24.180
Fish are stupid, but-- eureka!

22:24.180 --> 22:25.940
Oh, the brain is back, baby!

22:25.940 --> 22:28.320
-Kowalski, are you smart again?

22:28.320 --> 22:29.830
-Or at least less stupid?

22:29.830 --> 22:32.480
-Do alkaline earth metals
have plus two charge?

22:32.480 --> 22:33.570
-He's back.

22:33.570 --> 22:37.780
-But how did you restore
your beautiful mind?

22:37.780 --> 22:40.020
-Fish, our brain food.

22:40.020 --> 22:40.850
-Brain food?

22:40.850 --> 22:41.550
-Yes.

22:41.550 --> 22:44.340
You see, fish are rich
in omega-3 fatty acids,

22:44.340 --> 22:46.790
like eicosapentaenoic
acid, and it's

22:46.790 --> 22:49.110
brainy buddy
docosahexaenoic acid.

22:49.110 --> 22:50.390
-Boring.

22:50.390 --> 22:53.230
-Ah, it sure is nice to
have the old Kowalski back.

22:53.230 --> 22:54.930
[EXPLOSION]

22:54.930 --> 22:56.690
-It sure is, young Private.
