I just don't have it figured
out right in this moment.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.546
- I know you can take care
of yourself, OK?

40:18.590 --> 40:20.853
I'm actually asking you
to do this because I want to.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.028
- Oh, really?

40:22.071 --> 40:23.986
Then why didn't you
ask me before?

40:24.030 --> 40:25.901
Why are you only asking me now?

40:25.945 --> 40:27.468
- Gee, I don't know.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.035
Maybe because you bought a
freakin' house before I could?

40:29.078 --> 40:31.820
- Oh, so maybe my house
falling through

40:31.864 --> 40:34.475
is not such a terrible thing
for you

40:34.519 --> 40:36.216
because you can come in here

40:36.259 --> 40:39.437
and rescue me
like I am some charity case?

40:39.480 --> 40:42.091
- Are you serious?
What are you talking about?

40:42.135 --> 40:43.789
I've never thought of you
that way.

40:43.832 --> 40:44.964
- You know what?

40:45.007 --> 40:46.182
This is not a good night
for company.

40:46.226 --> 40:49.795
- I think you might
be right about that.

40:49.838 --> 40:52.362
