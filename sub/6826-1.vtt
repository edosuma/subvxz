02:35.202 --> 02:37.202
-Amy, what's wrong?
- I need your help!

02:37.842 --> 02:40.083
It's Connie,
she's run away again!

02:43.803 --> 02:45.003
She's only 15.

02:47.444 --> 02:50.644
How does my daughter fall
for this slime ball?

02:51.164 --> 02:52.004
Do you know him?

02:52.244 --> 02:54.645
Yeah, I met him once.
His name is Zip.

02:55.565 --> 02:56.845
That's a great name, huh?

02:57.885 --> 02:59.045
Jack, you're a cop.

02:59.285 --> 03:01.846
Grand theft auto.
You want missing persons.

03:02.806 --> 03:04.366
You know where he lives?

03:05.246 --> 03:09.767
Something like Trump Street,
or Trout Street or....

03:10.047 --> 03:12.767
- Turk? Turk Street?
- Yes, Turk Street. Turk Street.

03:12.887 --> 03:13.968
So tell missing persons.

03:14.088 --> 03:15.448
They've got a list a mile long.

03:15.568 --> 03:18.768
By the time they get to her, she'll
be the age I wanted her to leave.

03:18.888 --> 03:19.328
She'll be back.

03:19.608 --> 03:23.169
Three days, Jack.
I'm really scared.

03:23.689 --> 03:25.129
- Amy, I'm....
- I know.

03:25.849 --> 03:28.330
You're going on vacation,
some music festival.

03:29.450 --> 03:31.210
A week with you and your cello.

03:33.170 --> 03:35.371
That'll be so different for you.

03:43.012 --> 03:46.252
I know I'm just your neighbor.
I had no business asking.

03:47.532 --> 03:49.173
You have a great time, okay?

04:05.855 --> 04:09.175
I was planning on blacking him out.
I'm glad I didn't.

04:11.776 --> 04:14.696
It can't be that different
from looking for a car, right?

04:19.177 --> 04:19.976
Turk Street.

05:31.027 --> 05:32.747
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, you okay?

05:33.547 --> 05:34.708
Oh! You mustn't bother.

05:34.828 --> 05:37.428
It's no bother.
Just get out of the rain. Come on.

05:45.669 --> 05:47.749
So you don't live
in the neighborhood.

05:47.909 --> 05:49.550
No, I'm looking for someone.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.470
You can just
set them down there.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.430
No, no.
I'll take them in the kitchen.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.271
Well, this way.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.351
Thomas, we have a visitor!

06:02.912 --> 06:06.032
Don't be alarmed,
we have a stranger in the house.

06:06.832 --> 06:12.273
- Thomas, dear. This is....
- Jack. Jack Friar.

06:13.833 --> 06:16.593
This is Mr. Quarre,
I'm Mrs. Quarre.

06:17.554 --> 06:21.034
Who is it you're looking for,
Jack, a friend?

06:21.314 --> 06:23.754
No, a suspect.
Well, not a suspect really.

06:24.555 --> 06:25.355
A young man.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.155
You're a policeman.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.316
- I really should be going.
- Oh, dear, don't go.

06:32.556 --> 06:34.436
I'll put on some water for tea.

06:34.796 --> 06:38.237
- Thanks but I have to....
- We won't hear of you leaving.

06:38.517 --> 06:42.517
I must thank you for your kindness.
Now, it's Indian tea.

06:43.357 --> 06:47.078
India Indians. Not the ones
we beat the crap out of.

06:50.038 --> 06:51.358
No, I really must go.

06:52.919 --> 06:57.439
This one's made
from hard wood... Oak, mahogany.

06:59.039 --> 07:01.320
I've got one made in Africa
from ivory.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.200
Maybe one of your cousins
carved it, huh?

07:06.761 --> 07:07.401
Jack!

07:14.522 --> 07:16.042
Tell us about the suspect.

07:16.762 --> 07:20.803
Is he a lone operator
or a member of some vicious gang?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.963
He seems to be an operator.
Yeah.

07:25.283 --> 07:26.683
What does he look like?

07:27.364 --> 07:28.204
I'll show you.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.165
He had blond hair, blue eyes.

07:42.406 --> 07:43.246
Stand up.

07:45.006 --> 07:45.846
Stand up.

07:48.727 --> 07:50.607
- How'd you find me?
- What?

07:55.327 --> 07:56.928
I said, how did you find me?

07:57.288 --> 07:59.288
Find you? Who are you?

08:02.168 --> 08:02.849
Smart ass!

08:28.972 --> 08:30.252
You like baseball?

08:30.492 --> 08:34.212
It's just a tiny little bump,
officer. I checked it out.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.293
Ready for your tea?

08:36.573 --> 08:38.534
- I don't like tea.
- Well who does?

08:39.054 --> 08:41.014
Tea is for Chinks,
give him a real drink.

08:41.134 --> 08:42.174
Would you like a shot?

08:42.294 --> 08:45.295
Make it a Mai Tai.
That's what we drank in Korea.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.335
- Who are you people?
- What happened here?

08:49.895 --> 08:52.336
This cop showed up,
looking for us.

08:52.856 --> 08:53.816
Me at least.

08:54.016 --> 08:57.096
That's why we kept him here, boss,
for you to decide.

09:00.297 --> 09:01.657
What did you hit him with?

09:05.457 --> 09:07.058
- No guns.
- No guns.

09:11.578 --> 09:14.579
Do I have to post
a list of rules at the front door?

09:14.899 --> 09:17.059
It might... help.

09:17.899 --> 09:19.339
Has anyone else a gun?

09:20.100 --> 09:20.740
Sure.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.260
Finally got a hit, shit head.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.780
Come on, Miller, knock him in!

09:27.061 --> 09:27.861
Listen, mister....

09:28.101 --> 09:30.141
-....Quarre. - Quarre.
- It's an alias.

09:30.301 --> 09:33.021
I really had a photograph,
not of that psychopath. But....

09:33.141 --> 09:34.422
Shh, there's a game on.

09:44.063 --> 09:44.943
Thank you, dear.

09:46.623 --> 09:47.343
Don't gloat.

09:47.663 --> 09:50.864
I'm not gloating,
don't be a sore loser.

09:55.505 --> 09:57.345
Maybe he's onto us for Seattle.

09:57.545 --> 09:59.305
You shouldn't have
let him see you.

09:59.425 --> 10:01.825
I wasn't just going
to let him walk out of here.

10:02.226 --> 10:05.506
The questions are:
what are we going to do with him?

10:05.826 --> 10:07.506
What if there are more of him?

10:10.387 --> 10:11.067
Kill him.

10:12.947 --> 10:13.987
We do not kill him.

10:15.027 --> 10:17.748
Because the penalties
for killing are so distasteful.

10:17.948 --> 10:21.028
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
He didn't have your picture.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.548
He has no picture, Hoop.

10:23.389 --> 10:26.789
Perhaps we should outfit you
with a wooden club and a loincloth.

10:28.069 --> 10:28.749
Are you....

10:33.030 --> 10:34.870
Are you calling me backward?

10:44.392 --> 10:48.392
The best way to chase something,
Hoop, is to let it chase you.

10:50.072 --> 10:51.112
Greetings, Erin.

10:51.353 --> 10:54.273
Business. That's what you always say.
This is a business.

10:54.393 --> 10:57.073
Tell the old people
the schedule's been moved up a day.

10:57.193 --> 10:57.793
A day?

10:59.834 --> 11:02.274
- That's today.
- That's why you'll want to hurry.

11:04.434 --> 11:05.034
Sorry.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.756
You should try to have
a calming influence on Hoop..

11:17.916 --> 11:19.837
..rather than a inflammatory one.

11:21.877 --> 11:24.357
Is it your place to tell me
who not to inflame?

11:26.317 --> 11:28.518
As a matter of fact it is.

11:30.558 --> 11:32.118
With this rose, I thee wed.

11:33.038 --> 11:35.359
All things in good time.
Until then,..

11:36.759 --> 11:37.999
..Lover and loved.

11:38.599 --> 11:40.239
Pimp and whore.

11:53.001 --> 11:54.802
Coarseness does not become you.

12:34.527 --> 12:35.927
That sick fuck.

12:40.248 --> 12:41.888
It'll all be over soon.

12:42.088 --> 12:42.808
All of it?

12:43.248 --> 12:48.089
- This job, our last.
- You and him? That over?

12:48.769 --> 12:50.929
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

12:51.130 --> 12:52.290
He hurts you.

12:53.290 --> 12:54.530
Keeps us down.

13:03.811 --> 13:04.851
I got to pack.

13:07.212 --> 13:08.052
I'll help.

13:12.012 --> 13:13.533
If Tyrone sees you
in my bedroom....

13:13.653 --> 13:16.093
We're just talking,
for Christ's sake.

13:19.334 --> 13:21.734
Okay. Later then.

13:28.415 --> 13:28.935
Hoop.

13:33.536 --> 13:35.016
I never chose Tyrone.

13:35.256 --> 13:38.296
Yeah, but sometimes
you laugh at me with him.

13:38.656 --> 13:41.737
He expects it of me.
Don't you understand that?

13:41.937 --> 13:43.297
Fucking cop's listening.

13:44.617 --> 13:45.217
Hoop.

13:48.538 --> 13:50.098
The cop's not our problem.

13:52.578 --> 13:53.218
Tyrone.

14:12.981 --> 14:15.582
So we leave the airstrip
no later than 8 pm.

14:19.102 --> 14:20.382
Don't smoke that in here.

14:20.942 --> 14:23.423
I sure as hell won't miss you
telling me what to do.

14:25.303 --> 14:27.983
- Control freak.
- Control is a good thing, Thomas.

14:28.383 --> 14:29.864
You could do with more of it.

14:31.224 --> 14:32.224
Control that.

14:37.185 --> 14:40.545
Then we land in Bermuda
no later than 2 am. Correct?

14:40.745 --> 14:41.665
Aye aye, sir.

14:41.945 --> 14:42.385
We refuel..

14:42.505 --> 14:45.466
..and Hoop's piloting the balance
of the journey to the Caymans.

14:45.586 --> 14:48.026
- Is he taking his meds?
- Yes, I assume so, why?

14:48.146 --> 14:49.466
He asked me
to teach him to fly,..

14:49.586 --> 14:52.147
..but I'm not responsible
if he flies off the handle.

14:52.667 --> 14:53.867
I will control Hoop.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.190
How'd you know where to find us?

15:16.710 --> 15:17.510
I didn't.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.431
You're not who I'm looking for.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.431
I have a pict --

15:23.911 --> 15:27.312
Yeah, right. A picture with a guy
with blond hair, blue eyes.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.672
I'm looking for a girl.

15:29.952 --> 15:31.632
Oh, now it's a girl.

15:31.752 --> 15:34.353
Gee, you know I just can't keep
your stories straight.

15:34.793 --> 15:35.273
Hoop!

15:36.113 --> 15:39.713
- Stop it!
- Alright. Settle down.

15:43.994 --> 15:45.114
These are too tight.

15:48.395 --> 15:51.595
Eventually I'm going to be
alone with you, cop.

15:51.875 --> 15:53.115
Get away from him.

15:56.076 --> 15:57.076
Is that better?

15:58.156 --> 15:58.796
Thanks.

16:13.678 --> 16:14.758
There is a picture.

16:16.919 --> 16:18.159
And there is a girl.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.521
Was it out of willfulness or out
of stupidity you let him see you?

16:32.721 --> 16:33.801
I'm sorry, Tyrone.

16:35.241 --> 16:37.642
But I think he seems
to have seen you too.

16:42.442 --> 16:43.403
No he hasn't.

16:44.523 --> 16:46.283
It seems he's smarter than you.

16:48.563 --> 16:50.964
She's like a spoiled child.

16:51.524 --> 16:53.844
Hateful towards those
who take care of her..

16:54.044 --> 16:56.844
..and yet totally dependent.
- Leave her alone.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.765
And Hoop is the spoiled boy.

17:01.485 --> 17:02.605
The spoiled boy,..

17:03.165 --> 17:06.406
..to whom I gave a future despite
the metal plate in his head..

17:06.646 --> 17:08.246
..and the diagnosed psychosis.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.205
Now, Hoop,..

17:09.486 --> 17:12.406
..was it the Belle of Tacos
or the King of Burgers..

17:12.686 --> 17:15.166
..which had most recently
rejected your services?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.087
What are you laughing at, cop?!

17:20.328 --> 17:23.647
Maybe it's good that our stay
in these close quarters nears its end.

17:23.768 --> 17:24.688
Brunch is ready.

17:25.048 --> 17:26.289
No, brunch is canceled.

17:26.409 --> 17:29.449
The unexpected appearance
by the officer has altered our plans.

17:29.569 --> 17:30.289
Excuse me.

17:30.729 --> 17:34.650
I have been cooking
since his God damned appearance.

17:35.090 --> 17:36.370
No one said anything.

17:42.051 --> 17:44.171
Well, perhaps brunch
is just what we need.

17:51.772 --> 17:53.733
Who would like to say
the blessing?

17:57.373 --> 17:58.813
How about our guest?

17:59.373 --> 18:00.814
He should say a prayer.

18:01.094 --> 18:04.334
- Leave him alone.
- You have nothing to worry about.

18:04.574 --> 18:07.214
I'm sure everything
will go as planned.

18:07.615 --> 18:09.175
I'll say the blessing.

18:12.295 --> 18:14.856
Thank you, Lord, for that
which we are about to receive....

18:14.976 --> 18:16.776
Ten million dollars, Amen!

18:31.498 --> 18:33.458
You always forget the ketchup.

18:35.979 --> 18:36.899
Bring me a beer.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.059
Please.

18:44.620 --> 18:45.540
No, thank you.

18:46.660 --> 18:49.740
He's probably not used
to eating a proper breakfast.

18:49.981 --> 18:51.021
This is delicious.

18:52.941 --> 18:54.901
Remember you're flying, Thomas.

18:55.181 --> 18:57.062
I flew 57 missions in Korea..

18:57.182 --> 18:58.542
..and I was drunk
every damn time.

18:58.662 --> 19:00.302
- Don't you tel --
- Let him drink.

19:00.782 --> 19:02.022
I'll fly the damn plane.

19:02.142 --> 19:05.303
I'll let you co-pilot, shut the fuck
up while I'm telling my story.

19:05.423 --> 19:06.183
Excuse me, dear,..

19:06.343 --> 19:08.463
..but nobody gives a titty
about your story.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.303
I don't want
this punk interrupting me.

19:12.624 --> 19:15.384
Come on, old man! You want to fly?
I'll let you fly.

19:15.584 --> 19:17.624
Come on.
Come on. First one's free.

19:19.865 --> 19:21.065
Are you children?!

19:21.745 --> 19:23.505
Must I put you in separate rooms?

19:32.067 --> 19:33.587
Take him into the kitchen.

19:35.307 --> 19:36.627
You brought the cops.

19:37.147 --> 19:37.907
Shut up!

19:38.827 --> 19:40.428
You defective little prick.

19:46.028 --> 19:47.789
It's our banker friend.
Delay him.

19:48.989 --> 19:50.469
Keep him out of the house.

19:51.669 --> 19:53.790
Your clothing is inappropriate.
Go change it.

19:56.150 --> 19:58.230
David.
What are you doing here?

19:58.350 --> 20:01.311
I needed to see Erin.
She left me a message, it's important.

20:01.431 --> 20:03.391
She's not available just now.

20:03.911 --> 20:04.751
Where is she?

20:05.431 --> 20:08.792
Frankly I don't know.
I just came in from shopping.

20:09.752 --> 20:12.072
I'm sure she'll get
in touch with you later.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.273
Why don't you
go back to your office?

20:14.473 --> 20:16.553
If Mr. Quarre knew
you were playing hooky..

20:16.673 --> 20:19.593
..he might not look so kindly
on you dating his granddaughter.

20:34.915 --> 20:35.796
David!

20:37.676 --> 20:39.756
Erin! Hey!

20:45.237 --> 20:46.397
It's happening today.

20:47.157 --> 20:48.757
- What?
- Yeah, now.

20:49.117 --> 20:49.798
Why?

20:50.198 --> 20:52.998
Well, I don't know why.
But Tyrone says it has to be.

20:54.518 --> 20:55.638
Look, I can't.

20:56.038 --> 20:58.159
If you want us to be together,
you have to.

21:01.079 --> 21:03.800
Go back to the bank
and we'll see you soon, okay?

21:10.240 --> 21:12.681
David,
I'm in the street in my robe.

21:13.641 --> 21:14.761
Look, I adore you.

21:29.723 --> 21:30.803
Thomas! Isabelle!

21:31.283 --> 21:33.844
If we're delayed,
simply wait at the landing field.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.644
Keep your cell phone on
in case of a problem. Erin!

21:38.965 --> 21:41.085
You will stay
and entertain our guest.

21:41.405 --> 21:43.885
Whoa, whoa, what about David?
He expects me.

21:44.805 --> 21:46.406
I will deal with David.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.006
- Hoop!
- Yeah.

21:50.486 --> 21:51.206
Good.

21:52.406 --> 21:53.807
So, shall we?

21:57.287 --> 21:58.327
Take my bags, Hoop.

22:00.728 --> 22:01.808
Both of them.

22:07.849 --> 22:09.369
Be available to take calls.

22:10.529 --> 22:13.649
David may need to hear
your devoted voice for reassurance.

22:27.651 --> 22:28.612
You are art.

22:35.493 --> 22:36.573
Do not fade.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.461
- Are you comfortable?
- Been better.

23:45.743 --> 23:47.143
Hey, you okay?

23:50.303 --> 23:51.783
May I have some water?

23:52.544 --> 23:55.424
Water?
You look a little stressed.

23:59.344 --> 24:03.185
- Look, miss....
- Erin, please. - Erin.

24:03.865 --> 24:07.986
You need to let me go before that
head case Hoop comes back to kill me.

24:08.306 --> 24:10.066
Tyrone won't let Hoop kill you.

24:11.586 --> 24:14.227
Tyrone is against killing.

24:31.989 --> 24:32.469
So...

24:36.110 --> 24:39.150
Do you want any kind of music?
You like some music?

24:41.550 --> 24:44.751
- Look, miss, please....
- I can't let you escape,..

24:45.151 --> 24:48.351
..because then I would have
to escape and no one escapes Tyrone.

24:48.591 --> 24:49.712
That's ridiculous.

24:50.792 --> 24:51.592
Is it?

24:58.273 --> 25:00.953
This is how Tyrone says
you shouldn't have left.

25:11.555 --> 25:14.555
It's alright, I get ten percent
off my pedicures now.

25:28.997 --> 25:31.238
- Are you taking your medication?
- Why?

25:31.718 --> 25:33.078
You appear agitated.

25:33.678 --> 25:35.358
Yeah, well you piss me off.

25:36.158 --> 25:38.719
They got a medication
to make you stop doing that?

25:40.799 --> 25:43.639
What do you plan on doing
with your share of the money?

25:48.280 --> 25:50.480
I want... to breed dogs..

25:53.241 --> 25:54.201
..back in Utah.

25:56.001 --> 25:56.841
Excellent!

26:00.922 --> 26:03.002
Is there a young lady
in the picture?

26:04.722 --> 26:06.603
Maybe there is,
maybe there isn't.

26:15.844 --> 26:16.284
D --

26:18.084 --> 26:18.924
David Brewster.

26:19.124 --> 26:20.685
We're here. Hoop is beginning.

26:20.845 --> 26:22.325
Why are we doing this today?

26:22.445 --> 26:23.045
What?

26:25.525 --> 26:26.765
What did you say?

26:27.085 --> 26:28.326
I need an explanation.

26:28.526 --> 26:31.246
Your explanation will be
your share of the money.

26:33.286 --> 26:35.087
- Is Erin there?
- No she's not.

26:35.207 --> 26:36.287
But I have complete faith..

26:36.407 --> 26:38.687
..you will be able
to swindle your bank without her.

26:38.807 --> 26:41.368
Just make sure you're available
for me when I enter.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.771
You don't look so good.

27:03.571 --> 27:05.851
That's because
you're used to looking at you.

27:10.732 --> 27:13.452
Maybe that drink
wasn't such a good idea.

27:13.852 --> 27:16.332
- What should I do?
- What should you do?

27:16.452 --> 27:19.293
Find that picture so you can see
I was telling the truth..

27:19.413 --> 27:21.053
..and you can tell your friends.

27:21.933 --> 27:25.334
I'll look a lot better when I'm not
waiting for someone to kill me.

27:33.975 --> 27:34.615
Alright.

28:03.579 --> 28:08.100
Listen, I couldn't find the picture.
Okay, I walked the whole block.

28:14.021 --> 28:14.741
Hey!

28:21.822 --> 28:22.342
Oh, God.

28:30.263 --> 28:33.703
Please, don't die.
Don't die, please.

28:35.624 --> 28:36.104
Shit!

28:49.946 --> 28:50.666
Shit!

29:58.075 --> 29:59.436
How you doing, leatherhead?

29:59.956 --> 30:03.716
I got the generator set up in case
this storm messes with the lights.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.236
How's it look?

30:05.877 --> 30:06.917
Oh, it looks great.

30:07.437 --> 30:09.597
I've been thinking
about some of those missions....

30:09.717 --> 30:11.237
- Has the plane been fueled?
- Yes.

30:11.357 --> 30:13.518
And I'll be here
just as long as you need me.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.040
Excuse me, sir.

30:45.482 --> 30:47.322
I put your kit in the fridge.

30:49.843 --> 30:51.403
You could have let me die.

30:53.203 --> 30:56.924
Cop dead from a diabetic coma.
It's perfect.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.164
Dump the body somewhere.

31:01.725 --> 31:03.845
Nobody would ever know
I'd been kidnapped.

31:12.006 --> 31:13.286
I guess I owe you one.

31:14.886 --> 31:15.887
I mean that.

31:20.607 --> 31:22.767
I noticed
your suitcases were packed.

31:24.368 --> 31:26.648
Were you supposed
to be somewhere else today?

31:27.688 --> 31:29.168
Not on Turk Street.

31:33.329 --> 31:34.209
Like where?

31:39.250 --> 31:40.330
The Berkshires.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.691
Fantasy camp
for frustrated musicians.

31:48.371 --> 31:51.972
Basketball junkies go to Michael
Jordan's basketball clinic.

31:52.852 --> 31:55.172
I get my fix
playing with Yo Yo Ma.

31:56.372 --> 31:58.573
Your apartment struck me as lonely.

32:01.293 --> 32:02.373
Don't cops dream?

32:07.294 --> 32:08.654
Nightmares mostly.

32:13.535 --> 32:16.095
I don't trust you leaving here
without seeing Erin.

32:16.375 --> 32:19.096
Then by all means you should
call her for reassurance.

32:19.296 --> 32:20.776
I trust she's at home.

32:32.457 --> 32:33.218
Women talk.

32:34.898 --> 32:36.218
Some excessively.

32:41.379 --> 32:42.859
- Yes?
- We got problems.

32:42.979 --> 32:45.219
The system is patched
into a backup power source..

32:45.339 --> 32:46.979
..that's more complicated
than I thought.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.060
Can you deactivate it?

32:48.180 --> 32:50.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm working on it.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.700
It's just going to take some time.

32:52.940 --> 32:54.421
- How much?
- I don't know.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.341
- Two, three minutes tops.
- Do it!

33:19.944 --> 33:21.904
Did I hear what I just heard?

33:23.465 --> 33:26.465
I was a state sponsored prodigy
until Moscow collapsed.

33:28.585 --> 33:32.666
My peers became prostitutes,
musically or otherwise.

33:34.306 --> 33:35.746
I met a man in a bar.

33:36.386 --> 33:38.307
Tyrone became your ticket out.

33:42.187 --> 33:46.148
He said he saw my potential.
I flattered myself he meant my music.

33:50.949 --> 33:53.109
So you guys
are robbing a bank, right?

33:54.669 --> 33:55.309
How?

34:04.831 --> 34:05.711
Just smile..

34:06.591 --> 34:08.791
..as you tell me
about the Federal Reserve.

34:13.232 --> 34:15.072
You really don't know who we are?

34:16.232 --> 34:18.312
I'm just a cop
who finds stolen cars..

34:18.552 --> 34:20.313
..who's looking for a lost girl.

34:23.273 --> 34:25.313
And look, you found one.

34:26.634 --> 34:28.833
You are not lost.

34:31.954 --> 34:33.995
It would take
a search party to find me.

34:50.397 --> 34:51.637
What are you doing?

34:58.078 --> 34:58.838
Stand.

35:29.643 --> 35:32.483
Ladies and gentlemen,
please calm down.

35:33.163 --> 35:36.524
- I'm sure the problem will be
fixed momentarily. - Send the money.

35:36.644 --> 35:38.884
Send the money!
Send the money!

35:41.164 --> 35:44.045
Sir, I'm sorry, I'm sure
the problem is just momentary.

35:44.285 --> 35:45.405
I don't have moments.

35:45.525 --> 35:47.645
Tell your officer
to wire my loan immediately.

35:47.765 --> 35:50.125
We wire funds electronically.
Our computers are down....

35:50.246 --> 35:51.886
Well, to hell with your computers!

35:52.206 --> 35:54.286
My funds must be sent
by 6 o'clock.

35:54.406 --> 35:57.046
I'm afraid that if wiring
the funds is an impossibility....

35:59.847 --> 36:01.287
Have you heard of this device?

36:01.407 --> 36:04.167
Can it not be used with
your approval to transfer funds?

36:04.288 --> 36:06.368
Sir, please,
please just calm yourself.

36:06.488 --> 36:08.488
If you'll just step into my office.
Would you mind?

36:16.889 --> 36:18.970
Do you know "Chanson Triste"
by Du Parc?

36:43.733 --> 36:45.773
Do you like
being tied up in a chair?

36:47.214 --> 36:49.614
Or would you rather play
some beautiful music?

37:42.381 --> 37:43.902
How much are we talking about?

37:44.502 --> 37:45.382
Ten million.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.502
Our spread is substantial.
It went to committee.

37:48.622 --> 37:50.903
Now, think lender liability, sirs.

37:51.423 --> 37:53.663
If those funds
aren't in escrow by day's end..

37:53.783 --> 37:56.823
..my company will lose
a one hundred million dollar contract.

37:56.944 --> 37:59.384
So consider that
to be your true exposure.

37:59.904 --> 38:02.464
My laptop is charged.
I could modem it through.

38:02.824 --> 38:04.065
I'm calling my lawyer.

38:04.345 --> 38:07.145
Sir, that won't be necessary.
Get the laptop.

38:50.751 --> 38:52.111
I missed a few notes.

38:54.192 --> 38:57.152
That's a nice piece.
I never played it before.

39:07.634 --> 39:10.474
I know what I want
for saving your life.

39:12.274 --> 39:13.274
What's that?

39:14.675 --> 39:17.115
They say playing the cello
is like dancing.

39:19.355 --> 39:20.195
Show me.

39:22.356 --> 39:23.076
How?

39:24.236 --> 39:27.316
You'd have to put the gun down.
It's crazy.

39:28.517 --> 39:31.317
I believe in the concept
of a man and a woman.

39:33.237 --> 39:34.877
And the man owing her one.

39:37.518 --> 39:39.478
I mean,
you did say that, didn't you?

39:40.358 --> 39:41.758
That you owe me one.

39:47.959 --> 39:48.959
Don't do this.

39:59.921 --> 40:00.601
Damn you.

40:31.966 --> 40:33.286
Put your hand on mine.

40:44.247 --> 40:44.807
A.

40:51.728 --> 40:52.408
D.

40:58.969 --> 40:59.529
G.

41:13.851 --> 41:15.252
I could break your neck.

41:17.012 --> 41:17.772
I should.

41:22.653 --> 41:23.733
Yeah, you should.

42:04.099 --> 42:04.859
Are we done?

42:06.899 --> 42:08.139
Yeah, we're done.

42:12.860 --> 42:13.580
We're even.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.463
Mr. Abernathy, this disk contains
all the routing information,..

42:35.583 --> 42:38.384
..account numbers and passwords.
It's your authentication.

42:38.944 --> 42:40.784
Great,
just a little more paperwork.

42:47.785 --> 42:48.385
Now,..

42:52.546 --> 42:53.426
..about Erin.

42:56.186 --> 42:58.266
He insists
on meeting Erin at his place.

42:59.026 --> 43:00.387
We don't have time for this.

43:01.947 --> 43:03.587
Do we know
where the banker lives?

43:03.707 --> 43:05.907
Yeah, it's over the mountain.
It's a haul.

43:06.948 --> 43:09.628
- You've been there?
- I drove her a couple of times.

43:09.748 --> 43:11.708
I thought they used
to meet in restaurants.

43:11.828 --> 43:12.868
Well, maybe he cooks.

43:15.789 --> 43:16.469
Go there.

43:21.350 --> 43:22.590
Tyrone called.

43:23.470 --> 43:26.030
He said it could be
another couple of hours.

43:26.750 --> 43:28.351
I sent Willy for dinner.

43:28.591 --> 43:31.151
Tyrone? And you trust him?

43:33.951 --> 43:36.032
This job
is no different from Seattle..

43:36.232 --> 43:38.192
..or Sydney or Dallas or Miami.

43:38.432 --> 43:39.912
And he still needs us.

43:40.712 --> 43:43.273
Unless he thinks
he can take a bus to the Caymans.

43:43.433 --> 43:45.233
But this is our last one.

43:45.473 --> 43:47.073
Then he wouldn't have called.

43:51.634 --> 43:54.194
Do you think
we'll be happy in Fiji?

43:59.355 --> 44:01.835
- We can have sex on the beach.
- Oh Thomas!

44:01.955 --> 44:03.436
Let's go wait in the airplane.

44:03.556 --> 44:05.516
You know I won't
have sex on airplanes.

44:05.756 --> 44:07.876
But this one's on the ground.

45:07.525 --> 45:09.125
When was he leaving the bank?

45:09.405 --> 45:11.605
He should have been here
45 minutes ago.

45:14.686 --> 45:17.686
She gabs on the phone, even as
the outcome remains unsettled.

45:18.566 --> 45:20.887
Not even you
would be that dim-witted.

45:26.847 --> 45:29.048
Maybe the two of them
are working together.

45:38.129 --> 45:39.689
- Get out of the car.
- What?

45:39.889 --> 45:41.249
- Get out of the car.
- Why?

45:41.490 --> 45:42.610
Watch for him.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.970
Hey, it's raining out here!

45:49.571 --> 45:50.731
Then go inside.

46:57.220 --> 46:58.981
- Get in!
- But there was a accident.

46:59.101 --> 47:00.901
I don't want to hear about it.
Get in!

47:04.021 --> 47:05.822
- You see that?
- What?

47:06.222 --> 47:08.302
This! This! This! This!

47:15.183 --> 47:18.183
- Just how would he find you?
- Not by looking.

47:18.903 --> 47:20.504
He knows where I'd go.

47:21.784 --> 47:23.184
He can hear me think.

47:30.185 --> 47:32.185
What would he do
when he found you?

47:34.906 --> 47:36.386
Maybe he'd kill me.

47:45.707 --> 47:48.708
Maybe you could prevent that
from happening. Maybe...

47:49.428 --> 47:51.988
Maybe he and Hoop
are coming back to kill you.

47:52.148 --> 47:54.828
You worked your way
partially free from the bonds.

47:55.229 --> 47:58.509
You'd have no choice
but to kill them in self-defense.

47:59.509 --> 48:00.909
So give me the gun.

48:04.510 --> 48:07.230
We could wind up
with ten million dollars.

48:10.511 --> 48:13.511
You know what happens to cops
who have ten million dollars.

48:14.311 --> 48:15.951
They eat their service revolvers.

48:16.152 --> 48:18.312
- They can't....
- Open your mind, Jack.

48:21.072 --> 48:22.472
You're more than a cop.

48:23.072 --> 48:24.753
I'm more than a thief.

48:26.753 --> 48:29.153
You'd know that
if you're paying attention.

48:33.194 --> 48:34.194
I have been.

48:39.355 --> 48:40.195
And I know.

48:43.035 --> 48:43.795
Erin?

48:46.916 --> 48:47.876
Where is she?

48:49.476 --> 48:50.236
Erin!

48:55.557 --> 48:56.837
Hey, banker boy!

48:57.197 --> 48:58.798
What are you doing in my house?

48:58.918 --> 49:00.318
You should thank him.

49:00.598 --> 49:04.318
Look what a splendid effort he made
infiltrating your bank today.

49:07.999 --> 49:09.119
Where's the disk?

49:16.200 --> 49:17.640
Ahh gee, it's locked!

49:33.683 --> 49:35.443
There's no fucking disk!

49:36.723 --> 49:37.763
Where is it?

49:42.524 --> 49:44.884
Hey, what's this, huh?

49:46.324 --> 49:47.204
Go ahead,..

49:47.845 --> 49:49.525
..it's password protected.

49:51.685 --> 49:54.245
Okay! Okay! Okay!

49:55.366 --> 49:57.366
But I just risked
everything for Erin.

49:57.486 --> 50:00.566
You think I'm going to blab now
just to get out of a beating?

50:00.686 --> 50:03.767
Well... tick-tock.

50:06.447 --> 50:07.487
What time is it?

50:12.048 --> 50:13.328
They haven't called.

50:14.968 --> 50:19.129
Must've left you behind.
Or should I say they left your ass?

50:19.569 --> 50:22.289
- They wouldn't.
- No, and a fine ass it is.

50:22.529 --> 50:26.010
You can keep sitting on it until
my cop friends start looking for me.

50:26.130 --> 50:29.370
Or you can cut me loose, come in
with me and tell what happened.

50:30.091 --> 50:30.811
Damn!

50:35.771 --> 50:36.331
What?

50:39.052 --> 50:39.732
What?

50:51.654 --> 50:52.374
Bastard!

50:54.094 --> 50:55.294
I'm to blame now?

50:55.414 --> 50:57.814
Go ahead, but that
still doesn't change the facts.

50:57.934 --> 50:59.815
They didn't need you
and left your ass.

50:59.935 --> 51:01.015
Shush! God!

51:12.697 --> 51:13.217
Hello?

51:13.337 --> 51:14.977
Why has the phone been occupied?

51:15.097 --> 51:17.537
I'm sorry, I didn't even know
it was off the hook.

51:17.657 --> 51:18.817
Why didn't you check it?

51:18.937 --> 51:20.818
How could I know
it was off the hook?

51:21.578 --> 51:23.618
Your friend here
insists on seeing you..

51:23.738 --> 51:25.938
..before he gives us
our information.

51:27.979 --> 51:30.299
You must have
fucked your way into his heart.

51:37.420 --> 51:40.981
Hoop's on his way for me.
I have to get ready.

51:45.901 --> 51:47.662
So this is your first crime?

51:48.702 --> 51:49.302
Yeah.

51:50.022 --> 51:53.742
- No embezzlement, no juggling....
- No. Nothing.

51:53.982 --> 51:55.183
Not even as a kid?

51:56.343 --> 51:59.583
- No shoplifting, no peeping tom?
- Hardly.

52:01.103 --> 52:03.264
So this really is your inauguration.

52:04.664 --> 52:05.664
Take my advice...

52:05.904 --> 52:07.984
You know,
I stole my Dad's car once.

52:08.264 --> 52:10.865
- Really?
- Yeah. Drove it to Mexico.

52:11.145 --> 52:12.145
What happened?

52:12.785 --> 52:14.265
Drove it off a cliff.

52:16.066 --> 52:17.706
Never even told my father.

52:20.626 --> 52:23.267
Apparently, driving
isn't one of your talents.

55:15.571 --> 55:17.851
- Come on in here! Come on!
- Jack, please.

55:18.011 --> 55:20.612
Come on! Keep coming.

55:22.212 --> 55:24.292
Come on, pick up the phone!

55:24.412 --> 55:26.133
- What are you doing?
- Pick it up!

55:26.853 --> 55:27.853
Pick this up!

55:46.736 --> 55:50.456
- I can make it look
like he died escaping. - Don't.

55:53.537 --> 55:55.417
Now you go get some more rope.

56:41.543 --> 56:43.464
Remember what's to happen later.

56:46.224 --> 56:46.984
Tyrone.

56:47.584 --> 56:50.585
Not until we have
the disk and the password.

57:00.106 --> 57:00.946
Just me.

57:02.066 --> 57:03.026
Just you.

57:25.590 --> 57:28.990
How fetching you look, my dear.
Perfect for a late date.

57:31.030 --> 57:31.870
David!

57:32.271 --> 57:32.951
Erin!

57:35.471 --> 57:38.031
I tried to be there
but he left without me.

57:40.072 --> 57:41.832
Quick, what's the password?

57:46.353 --> 57:47.873
We need some time together.

57:48.273 --> 57:49.673
Well, there's no time.

57:49.913 --> 57:53.594
Well, certainly a short interlude
can be squeezed in for young lovers.

58:01.195 --> 58:02.195
Give me the gun.

58:05.915 --> 58:08.116
Give them fifteen minutes,
no more.

58:11.236 --> 58:12.836
I did it!
I did it!

58:13.476 --> 58:15.597
I knew you could.
Come here, come here.

58:17.837 --> 58:21.478
Not giving Tyrone the password
was so smart.

58:23.038 --> 58:25.798
God, who knows what
he would have done if I wasn't here.

58:27.278 --> 58:28.639
So what is it?

58:28.879 --> 58:31.919
Oh no, no, no.
I'm going to the Caymans with you.

58:37.040 --> 58:41.640
You cannot be seen with Tyrone.
Not now, not ever.

58:43.961 --> 58:46.441
I'm only going
to be gone for a few days.

58:47.481 --> 58:51.242
Then we can go away together
like we planned.

58:51.682 --> 58:53.762
I don't think
I can wait any longer.

58:54.122 --> 58:55.522
Oh, you poor thing.

58:57.843 --> 59:01.283
As soon as we get the money.
I promise.

59:03.363 --> 59:05.404
Enough promises.

59:19.966 --> 59:20.886
Oh, shit.

59:22.366 --> 59:23.806
I was dreaming,..

59:25.487 --> 59:26.967
..we were on this beach.

59:28.167 --> 59:30.647
I looked wonderful in my bikini.

59:41.129 --> 59:41.889
Yes?

59:42.129 --> 59:43.809
What the hell are you pulling?

59:44.689 --> 59:46.330
Our young friend became difficult.

59:46.450 --> 59:49.010
Difficult?
You haven't seen difficult, I have.

59:49.210 --> 59:52.330
You try a battalion of gooks
squirting napalm up your butt.

59:52.570 --> 59:53.971
That is difficult!

01:00:15.494 --> 01:00:18.734
....and you've been aptly rewarded.
- Now you listen to me, ass-face!

01:00:18.854 --> 01:00:20.935
The bank could still
figure this thing out.

01:00:35.497 --> 01:00:36.857
- Hoop!
- Banker boy!

01:00:37.337 --> 01:00:39.697
Did you have fun, huh?
Your time's up, I'm sorry.

01:00:39.817 --> 01:00:40.657
Stop it!

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.418
Did you have a good time?

01:00:44.138 --> 01:00:46.978
- Was your dick hard?
- Stop it!

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:49.779
- You fuck!
- You're unbelievable!

01:00:50.059 --> 01:00:52.499
- It's not his fault, it's my fault!
- Shut up!

01:00:52.739 --> 01:00:55.299
Stay out of this!
This is not about you!

01:00:55.499 --> 01:00:56.620
Stay there!

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.660
What's the matter Romeo?

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:02.100
Having a little trouble
with your pants?

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.021
Let me help you!

01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:06.301
Fuck! Fuck!

01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:09.501
You fuck!
What are you going to do, huh?

01:01:12.742 --> 01:01:15.222
- You stupid....
- Please stop, please!

01:01:15.622 --> 01:01:18.663
I told you, stay out of it!
I don't want to hurt you!

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:20.503
Fuck!

01:01:22.703 --> 01:01:23.703
You want to dance?

01:01:24.504 --> 01:01:27.304
- I'm sorry, did that hurt?
- Stop it! - Did that hurt?

01:01:27.424 --> 01:01:29.504
Get up! Here, come on!

01:01:31.825 --> 01:01:34.425
Come on! Come on!
Come on, banker boy!

01:01:35.465 --> 01:01:37.425
You little pussy!

01:01:38.506 --> 01:01:40.306
- She's mine!
- Stop it!

01:01:40.506 --> 01:01:41.786
She's mine!

01:01:42.546 --> 01:01:43.266
Tyrone!

01:01:44.506 --> 01:01:45.427
Tyrone!

01:01:46.507 --> 01:01:49.627
You have to hurry! Hoop's gone crazy!
He's killing David!

01:01:50.147 --> 01:01:53.308
He couldn't stop him!
He couldn't! He just snapped!

01:01:57.628 --> 01:01:59.509
His fifteen minutes were up.

01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:02.629
Did you get the password?

01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:05.469
You?

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:12.590
No, I didn't get the password,
because I was too busy fucking him!

01:02:16.671 --> 01:02:19.271
Can you think of any reason
I shouldn't let you hang?

01:02:19.631 --> 01:02:20.752
Tom! Tom!

01:02:21.072 --> 01:02:24.392
It's looking fierce out there!
We better take care of the lights!

01:02:24.512 --> 01:02:25.952
Don't worry, darling.
I'll do it.

01:02:27.112 --> 01:02:30.073
- Thomas, go get your slicker.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:32.993 --> 01:02:34.714
We'll give it one more hour.

01:02:56.437 --> 01:02:57.517
Maybe it's..

01:02:59.117 --> 01:03:01.717
..E-R-l-N.

01:03:07.478 --> 01:03:08.718
Password accepted.

01:03:57.245 --> 01:03:58.485
It might be the Quarres.

01:04:03.566 --> 01:04:04.886
Continue north, Hoop.

01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:08.767
- What about the plane?
- We don't need a plane.

01:04:09.727 --> 01:04:11.807
We'll be driving
to our destination.

01:04:12.327 --> 01:04:13.928
I see no reason to share this..

01:04:14.128 --> 01:04:16.528
..with that boorish man
and that insipid woman.

01:04:16.968 --> 01:04:19.408
Our shares
will increase accordingly.

01:04:19.528 --> 01:04:22.089
Is somebody planning on telling me
where we're going?

01:04:22.209 --> 01:04:23.249
We're driving to Albany,..

01:04:23.489 --> 01:04:26.609
..New York, where I've cultivated
some banking relationships.

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:28.210
Then what?

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:31.690
Then a mere three-hour drive
to the Canadian border.

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:37.171
I need to use the bathroom.

01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:39.131
You should have done that
back at the house.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:40.891
I didn't know that
back at the house!

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:44.452
We have a six-hour drive to Albany.

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:47.372
And if we're not
out of the country by 2 pm,..

01:04:48.212 --> 01:04:50.053
..you'll have no pot to piss in.

01:04:50.493 --> 01:04:52.213
We need to get gas anyway.

01:05:08.775 --> 01:05:11.136
Fill it up quickly
and check the tires.

01:05:12.856 --> 01:05:16.216
Erin, do me a favor.
Wipe off the dead banker.

01:06:08.224 --> 01:06:08.904
Tyrone.

01:06:11.984 --> 01:06:12.985
The cop had this.

01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:16.185
He wasn't looking for Hoop..

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:19.585
..for beating up some clerk
in Seattle, he was looking for you.

01:06:31.307 --> 01:06:33.107
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:44.029
Tell him.

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:56.951
I arranged for you to get the gun.
He wants you to kill the cop.

01:06:57.791 --> 01:06:58.391
Yeah.

01:07:01.471 --> 01:07:03.152
But it's not what we want.

01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:05.872
Yeah.

01:07:08.752 --> 01:07:09.353
Okay.

01:07:26.755 --> 01:07:27.275
What?

01:07:28.715 --> 01:07:29.475
Tire.

01:07:36.276 --> 01:07:37.797
....in the middle of nowhere.

01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:40.277
Why have you stopped here?

01:07:40.877 --> 01:07:42.877
I'm going to check
the spare in the trunk.

01:07:42.997 --> 01:07:44.478
What do you mean the spare?

01:07:46.158 --> 01:07:48.918
Didn't I tell you to check it
back at the gas station?

01:07:51.198 --> 01:07:53.279
Any last words, Brainiac?

01:07:54.399 --> 01:07:56.959
I'll spare you my wisdom,
you'll forsake it anyway.

01:07:57.119 --> 01:07:59.560
Oh no please,
I'm sure I'll miss it.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.200
I'll look at your life
as a novel,..

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.160
..this being the tragic moment..

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:06.961
..at which,
in the ultimate irony,..

01:08:07.081 --> 01:08:09.801
..our headstrong hero
shoots himself in the brain.

01:08:10.001 --> 01:08:12.922
So let me get this straight:
you're my brain?

01:08:13.962 --> 01:08:17.962
Not only that, I'm also
the restraint that you lack.

01:08:18.362 --> 01:08:19.082
Stand back.

01:08:27.084 --> 01:08:30.084
Without me,
you would be in prison or worse.

01:08:31.124 --> 01:08:33.805
You really think
you would thrive so without me?

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.685
Witness tonight. Because
I wasn't standing right beside you..

01:08:38.444 --> 01:08:39.604
..you killed a man.

01:08:42.086 --> 01:08:45.566
And once you shoot me,
you'll have killed two men today.

01:08:46.966 --> 01:08:48.807
And the cop, three.

01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:03.169
Do you imagine that Erin
will ride into the sunset with you?

01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:08.089
Shut that music off!

01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:12.010
- Turn it down!
- Okay! Okay!

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:15.850
Hoop! What are you doing?

01:09:17.011 --> 01:09:17.731
Nothing.

01:09:19.091 --> 01:09:21.571
Our friend
only got a little overexcited.

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.372
It's better now, isn't it?

01:09:29.692 --> 01:09:30.212
Yeah.

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:33.453
Get in the car.

01:09:35.533 --> 01:09:36.252
Not you.

01:09:41.493 --> 01:09:42.894
Were you behind this?

01:09:43.174 --> 01:09:45.055
You told me to give him the gun.

01:09:52.816 --> 01:09:54.896
So the policeman really is after me?

01:09:55.256 --> 01:09:55.776
Yes.

01:10:02.497 --> 01:10:03.377
We'll see.

01:10:05.578 --> 01:10:07.778
An unfortunate detour,
I'm afraid.

01:10:32.421 --> 01:10:33.342
I need the gun.

01:10:33.902 --> 01:10:35.742
No. Use another method.

01:10:37.022 --> 01:10:38.142
I've seen that you can.

01:10:39.182 --> 01:10:39.662
Go.

01:10:43.583 --> 01:10:45.583
Hoop, wait!

01:10:50.984 --> 01:10:52.184
Well, now my dear,..

01:10:52.984 --> 01:10:56.945
..witnessing an execution you caused
is only going to be awkward.

01:10:57.785 --> 01:10:59.665
What could you possibly say
to the man?

01:11:03.146 --> 01:11:03.706
Cop!

01:11:05.786 --> 01:11:07.106
I told you I'd be back.

01:11:07.466 --> 01:11:09.347
I hope you know how to die fast..

01:11:09.587 --> 01:11:11.707
..because we need
to be in Albany by eight.

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:14.667
You know how to die fast?

01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:17.148
Die fast, cop. Fast.

01:11:17.428 --> 01:11:22.228
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster! Faster!

01:11:22.509 --> 01:11:23.269
Faster, cop!

01:11:48.272 --> 01:11:49.672
Spare yourself the effort.

01:11:57.393 --> 01:11:59.314
We lack time,
so forgive my brevity.

01:11:59.914 --> 01:12:03.354
Were you carrying a photograph
when you stumbled upon our house?

01:12:04.194 --> 01:12:04.755
Yeah.

01:12:05.355 --> 01:12:06.595
Now look at me.

01:12:10.515 --> 01:12:11.676
Was the picture of me?

01:12:22.157 --> 01:12:23.357
Was this the picture?

01:12:23.597 --> 01:12:26.638
That wasn't the picture,
that wasn't the fucking picture!

01:12:26.918 --> 01:12:28.038
Leave him alone!

01:12:32.919 --> 01:12:34.519
The truth is it hardly matters.

01:12:34.919 --> 01:12:38.679
A killing has already occurred. Not
just this one but another man as well.

01:12:38.799 --> 01:12:40.320
So the stakes have been raised.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.640
It does make sense
to clean up loose ends.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.000
And I'm a loose end.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.520
The loosest.

01:12:47.721 --> 01:12:48.321
Erin...

01:12:50.361 --> 01:12:51.081
Come here.

01:13:01.483 --> 01:13:04.403
Now, just put your finger there.

01:13:06.283 --> 01:13:08.084
Easy, this is your baptism.

01:13:08.804 --> 01:13:12.404
You think 'cause you've already killed
somebody, killing me is no big deal?

01:13:12.524 --> 01:13:15.925
You kill me and every cop
on the planet takes a sudden vacation.

01:13:16.045 --> 01:13:19.405
You become the case that never closes,
the guy they never stop huntin'.

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:20.725
You be job one.

01:13:21.485 --> 01:13:24.406
Pay attention, Erin,
'cause this applies to you, too.

01:13:24.726 --> 01:13:27.126
When they catch you,
wherever they catch you..

01:13:27.326 --> 01:13:28.726
..they're going to subdue you.

01:13:28.846 --> 01:13:31.407
And they're going
to subdue you substantially.

01:13:32.087 --> 01:13:33.607
Then they're going
to tell you to run..

01:13:33.727 --> 01:13:36.648
..and that's going to confuse you,
'cause you never heard that before.

01:13:36.768 --> 01:13:39.728
Then your animal brain's going
to kick in with the survival mode.

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:42.688
Telling you stupid shit like:
"Hey, they're letting me go".

01:13:42.808 --> 01:13:45.289
- So you'll run.
- And then what?

01:13:46.569 --> 01:13:48.209
Then they shoot you, dumb ass.

01:13:48.729 --> 01:13:52.690
Well, don't you think
they have to catch me first?

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:56.170
Oh, you're thinking all that money
is going to help you hide?

01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:59.931
That's funny, 'cause those shit for
brains over there told me about your..

01:14:00.171 --> 01:14:00.811
..time frame.

01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:04.452
Now, if you planned on driving
to Albany in six hours,..

01:14:04.572 --> 01:14:07.212
..that means you're going
to use the New Jersey Turnpike.

01:14:07.332 --> 01:14:09.372
And you're probably
going to drive at night.

01:14:09.492 --> 01:14:10.812
But now you're late..

01:14:11.293 --> 01:14:13.173
..and you hadn't counted
on rush hour.

01:14:13.573 --> 01:14:16.773
So if you think you're still going
to make that drive in six hours..

01:14:16.893 --> 01:14:18.374
..you got another thing coming.

01:14:19.214 --> 01:14:22.734
Dearest, I don't remember
hearing anything about Albany.

01:14:23.094 --> 01:14:23.814
I knew it!

01:14:24.214 --> 01:14:26.255
You dirty double-crossing bastard!

01:14:26.455 --> 01:14:27.255
Put it down.

01:14:27.455 --> 01:14:29.455
Nobody's trying
to cross you, Thomas.

01:14:29.695 --> 01:14:31.775
Give him the disk. Now.

01:14:46.017 --> 01:14:48.378
Oh, God!
What have I done?

01:14:53.458 --> 01:14:54.219
Oh, God!

01:15:22.263 --> 01:15:25.103
This is a well-oiled machine!

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.944
Look, why don't you
take me with you?

01:15:30.424 --> 01:15:30.864
What?

01:15:31.344 --> 01:15:34.464
You can't get the money on your own,
but you can with my help.

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:37.105
My car's got flashing lights
and a siren,..

01:15:37.345 --> 01:15:39.505
..I can still get you
to Albany in time.

01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:41.345
You get as much of the money
as you can,..

01:15:41.465 --> 01:15:43.546
..I drive you to the border,
you go across.

01:15:44.386 --> 01:15:47.226
Hey, you promise me a share,
maybe I'll cross with you.

01:15:48.866 --> 01:15:49.867
And then what?

01:15:50.107 --> 01:15:52.427
First of all:
I need some more insulin.

01:15:52.787 --> 01:15:53.507
Secondly:

01:15:55.267 --> 01:15:58.748
..when we get across we let the girl
decide who she wants to go with.

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:11.590
You propose driving through
a busy city with a captive policeman.

01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:14.830
You must think me a foolhardy man.

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:36.273
Take a turn
at the next corner. Left.

01:16:48.435 --> 01:16:49.635
Now left again.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.957
I thought we were going
to the freeway.

01:17:03.877 --> 01:17:05.957
Turn again. Left.

01:17:17.079 --> 01:17:17.719
Go there.

01:17:29.401 --> 01:17:31.201
Out of the car, both of you.

01:17:47.803 --> 01:17:48.603
Further.

01:18:20.808 --> 01:18:21.408
Here.

01:18:26.449 --> 01:18:28.409
So how do you move
ten million dollars?

01:18:29.929 --> 01:18:32.010
Send the money
to a number of banks.

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:34.930
In amounts small enough
not to draw attention.

01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:37.370
Hey.

01:18:38.811 --> 01:18:40.651
Why don't you try
and get some sleep.

01:18:50.212 --> 01:18:52.172
Oh, man!
It's worse than I thought.

01:18:57.013 --> 01:18:59.373
Hey, hang on,
it's going to be bumpy.

01:19:15.176 --> 01:19:16.136
Nicely done!

01:19:18.336 --> 01:19:19.136
Oh, man.

01:19:22.577 --> 01:19:25.617
Hey. Are you going to shoot me
in the back while I'm driving?

01:19:55.181 --> 01:19:56.342
Mr. Leeds, please.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.742
- Yes. Can you hold please?
- Yes, I'll hold.

01:19:58.862 --> 01:20:02.062
So Tyrone, who's going in
to grab the money. Me?

01:20:02.222 --> 01:20:05.503
Don't be absurd.
I trust you no more than I trust her.

01:20:05.743 --> 01:20:07.423
Yes, Mr. Clifford Leeds, please.

01:20:07.623 --> 01:20:10.584
This is Mr. Leeds.
Welcome back, Mr. Abernathy.

01:20:10.704 --> 01:20:12.504
It's been so long
since we've seen you.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.784
One more thing, I'm a bit ill.

01:20:16.944 --> 01:20:20.625
Would it be possible for me to pick
up the checks at the drive-through?

01:20:20.745 --> 01:20:22.625
- Sure, if that's a problem....
- Not at all.

01:20:22.745 --> 01:20:24.546
I'll alert the teller
to watch for you.

01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:28.226
She'll know me by my chauffeur,
a very earnest looking black man.

01:20:29.226 --> 01:20:30.986
Okay, thank you, Clifford.

01:20:35.707 --> 01:20:36.547
Good morning.

01:20:39.228 --> 01:20:42.388
Mr. Abernathy.
Mr. Leeds said to be expecting you.

01:20:42.668 --> 01:20:43.308
Excellent!

01:20:45.068 --> 01:20:46.629
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:54.510
May I see those?

01:20:59.431 --> 01:21:03.111
Jesus, I get ID'd
trying to deposit a check.

01:21:04.751 --> 01:21:05.951
At my own bank!

01:21:11.712 --> 01:21:12.912
Where to next, Tyrone?

01:21:13.032 --> 01:21:15.193
Continue straight,
I'll tell you when to turn.

01:21:19.873 --> 01:21:21.354
Red light!
Red light!

01:21:21.994 --> 01:21:22.274
Damn.

01:21:22.394 --> 01:21:24.394
- We had the right of way!
- You asshole!

01:21:24.514 --> 01:21:26.834
I'm actually beginning
to trust you, officer.

01:21:26.954 --> 01:21:28.875
Enough to take
that gun out of my back?

01:21:29.675 --> 01:21:30.395
No,..

01:21:31.795 --> 01:21:32.795
..but this much.

01:21:38.636 --> 01:21:41.877
- Hey, how are you holding up?
- Fine.

01:21:56.199 --> 01:21:59.799
You are going to give her her share
before we cross the border, right?

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.080
Once we cross,..

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.760
..you can either go with me,
go with him..

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.881
..or go your own way.

01:22:30.283 --> 01:22:31.964
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:22:32.124 --> 01:22:34.804
I believe you have
some checks for me. Mr. Abernathy.

01:22:35.004 --> 01:22:36.244
- Abernathy?
- Yes.

01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:39.005
Watch your hand.

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:40.485
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:22:42.325 --> 01:22:42.965
Move it.

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:47.606
- Oh damn.
- What?

01:22:47.926 --> 01:22:49.006
Don't look.
Don't look.

01:22:49.646 --> 01:22:50.526
That teller.

01:22:50.886 --> 01:22:53.887
She's making the security guard
write down our license number.

01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:15.530
Can we do this quickly?

01:23:31.012 --> 01:23:33.012
We have time
to make it to another bank.

01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:36.693
It's not worth the risk.

01:24:08.097 --> 01:24:10.218
Now, then,
let's go to the border.

01:25:01.025 --> 01:25:01.825
We cool?

01:25:05.425 --> 01:25:06.346
We're cool.

01:25:10.826 --> 01:25:12.586
You're going
to have to lose the shotgun.

01:25:12.706 --> 01:25:16.027
It's essential to our understanding.
I'll just cover it.

01:25:16.227 --> 01:25:17.787
Give me the map, Erin.

01:25:19.507 --> 01:25:21.748
You've done excellent work,
officer Friar.

01:25:21.948 --> 01:25:24.148
Perhaps you'd like
to stay in my employ...

01:25:26.268 --> 01:25:28.749
Jack! You don't have
to kill him, please!

01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:34.470
I'm okay!

01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:36.150
- Don't move, Jack!
- I'm alright.

01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:39.630
Tyrone! Give yourself up!

01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:43.151
Halt! Police!

01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:44.991
Jack, don't kill him!

01:25:45.231 --> 01:25:46.191
Tyrone!

01:25:46.791 --> 01:25:48.832
It's over,
there's no place to go!

01:25:52.152 --> 01:25:52.992
Freeze!

01:26:06.714 --> 01:26:08.674
- Let go of me!
- Put it down!

01:26:09.195 --> 01:26:10.675
Put it down now!

01:26:10.995 --> 01:26:14.395
Do it! Step away from the car,
both hands up!

01:26:14.915 --> 01:26:16.996
Please, remain in your car!

01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:39.919
You understand that
while under Canada's jurisdiction..

01:26:40.039 --> 01:26:42.119
..we respect your interest
in this situation.

01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:45.200
No warrants or reports
have been made as of yet.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.880
We'll wait
for your recommendation.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.601
Lucky thing having
those license plates behind you.

01:27:06.003 --> 01:27:07.763
Tell them I was a hostage.

01:27:08.643 --> 01:27:09.683
It's the truth.

01:27:11.043 --> 01:27:12.924
I tried to leave him, you know.

01:27:13.204 --> 01:27:15.164
I tried to leave him.
I couldn't.

01:27:17.684 --> 01:27:19.725
I've got a million dollars
right here.

01:27:20.165 --> 01:27:21.365
You've got yours.

01:27:21.605 --> 01:27:23.965
We could spend
our lives on vacation.

01:27:24.845 --> 01:27:26.125
The same vacation.

01:27:33.967 --> 01:27:37.607
You have a way
of making me feel really good..

01:27:40.648 --> 01:27:41.968
..when you want something.

01:27:43.368 --> 01:27:46.328
- It's not like that.
- Oh, but it is.

01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:50.169
Only you don't know it.

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.610
When we danced the cello..

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:01.971
..you could have killed me.

01:28:04.491 --> 01:28:07.451
Whatever you saw in me then,
see it now.
