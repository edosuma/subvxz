WEBVTT

00:01.626 --> 00:04.587
(siren wailing)

00:05.964 --> 00:08.216
(police chatter on radio)

00:10.218 --> 00:14.097
(siren wailing)

00:14.639 --> 00:16.975
Carbon copy of last night, Frank,
a nightmare.

00:17.809 --> 00:18.852
Came out of the john.

00:19.477 --> 00:21.271
Presumably, he assembled
his weapon in there.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.983
-Which was?
-The same, nine-millimeter semiautomatic.

00:25.316 --> 00:28.486
He comes out, goes to the front,
blocks the door, opens fire.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.238
How many fatalities?

00:30.321 --> 00:34.325
Three, two more wounded, one critical,
which isn't half-bad, Frank.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.162
With all the lead we dug out of the walls,
he could've killed a dozen more.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.956
-Anyone get a description?
-Nothing solid.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.251
It's too dark, it's too smokey,
everybody's been drinking.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
Besides, a place like this,
4:00 in the morning,

00:45.336 --> 00:46.880
guys are all clenching in the corners.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.381
Get any witnesses down to the station,

00:48.465 --> 00:49.674
have them go through the mug books.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.259
-Probably a waste of time.
-Do it anyway.

00:51.634 --> 00:52.469
Yes, sir.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.596
FRANK: Oh, come on.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.016
ESTERHAUS: Item one, the power outage.

00:58.683 --> 01:03.396
At approximately 4:05 this a.m.,
for reasons as yet undetermined,

01:03.688 --> 01:08.151
a chain of transformers blew,
rendering 30 percent of the city

01:08.234 --> 01:10.737
and 100 percent of this precinct
without electricity.

01:11.529 --> 01:12.697
The department of power

01:12.781 --> 01:17.577
estimates repairs
will take from 12 to 24 hours.

01:17.660 --> 01:18.870
(officers groaning)

01:18.953 --> 01:20.747
In the meantime,
we can anticipate looting,

01:20.830 --> 01:23.166
traffic jams, countless people
stuck on elevators,

01:23.249 --> 01:24.334
you know the list,

01:24.793 --> 01:30.173
added to which, a forecast of temperatures
in excess of 95 degrees...

01:30.256 --> 01:31.382
(officers groaning)

01:31.466 --> 01:34.094
...and a relative humidity of 91 percent.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.888
What can I say? It's gonna be a doozy.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.475
Our own generator
is currently supplying electricity

01:40.558 --> 01:41.976
at a capacity of 70 percent,

01:42.060 --> 01:45.772
so please don't use
any more than you need.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.900
Sarge, uh, can we flush the toilets?

01:48.983 --> 01:50.401
(laughter)

01:50.485 --> 01:51.319
What?

01:53.446 --> 01:54.447
Yes.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.449
Lieutenant Calletano is coordinating

01:56.533 --> 01:59.285
a specific-duty roster
for the duration of the blackout.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.372
Uh, item two, assignments.

02:02.747 --> 02:05.208
Detectives LaRue, Washington,
and Belker only

02:05.291 --> 02:08.378
are excused from blackout-related duties
to continue investigation

02:08.920 --> 02:12.632
of Monday's multiple homicide
at The Starlight Lounge

02:13.049 --> 02:16.261
and last night's similar mayhem
at The Elbowroom on Hampton.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.847
While the rest of you attend
to the multitude of problems

02:18.930 --> 02:20.974
caused by the power failure,
do remain alert

02:21.057 --> 02:24.894
to such street discourse
as may pertain to those events.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.606
Item last, a personal indulgence, people.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.191
Uh...

02:30.441 --> 02:33.528
(officers groaning)

02:34.863 --> 02:38.783
Monmouth riding stables on Dekker Heights
reports an early-morning theft.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.076
Their alarm wasn't working.

02:40.910 --> 02:44.956
Missing, one light-tan all-leather bridle
with matching reins,

02:45.039 --> 02:47.959
one multicolored saddle blanket
of 100 percent wool,

02:48.042 --> 02:53.131
and one seven-year-old pinto gelding
answering to the name of Butch.

02:53.214 --> 02:57.051
(laughter)

02:57.135 --> 02:58.303
(both whinny)

03:00.221 --> 03:01.931
Now, you're not to spend
your valuable time

03:02.015 --> 03:04.100
combing the city for this equine,

03:04.184 --> 03:08.688
but if you were to happen upon Butch
in the course of your daily round,

03:08.771 --> 03:12.192
that, of course, would be
a horse of another color.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.403
(laughter)

03:15.486 --> 03:17.155
Okay, folks, let's roll.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.324
(indistinct conversations)

03:19.407 --> 03:21.242
And remember, it's a difficult day,

03:21.826 --> 03:24.287
so let's be extra careful out there.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.754
Belker.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.592
Move, pit breath!

03:40.678 --> 03:42.639
(harmonica playing)

03:56.069 --> 03:56.945
Sit!

04:06.913 --> 04:08.331
(sighs) Name?

04:08.873 --> 04:09.749
James.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.084
Harry?

04:11.501 --> 04:12.460
No, Dorsey.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.463
(telephone rings)

04:17.590 --> 04:18.716
Belker.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.594
Hi, Ma.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.139
I know, Ma, everybody's electricity's out.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.308
They don't know. Maybe soon.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.521
Just stay indoors and take it easy,
that's all.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.108
Ma... Ma...

04:35.400 --> 04:36.234
Ma!

04:37.151 --> 04:39.404
It is not going to be 120 degrees.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.239
Maybe it'll be 95.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.119
You'll close the doors
and windows and you'll be fine.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.203
I really got to go.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.373
I got a perp sitting here.
I got a fresh multiple homicide.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.086
Okay, I will check with you
every hour I promise.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.132
Well, I love you, too.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.633
Goodbye.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.137
Weather like this tough
on the old folks, huh?

05:04.220 --> 05:05.596
You keep out of it.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.640
Well, she's still got cold water.

05:08.057 --> 05:11.227
Yeah. If it gets too hot,
fill up the tub and sit in it.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.367
Hello, Ma?

05:27.577 --> 05:29.787
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:31.914
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:35.710
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:35.793 --> 05:37.462
(sirens wailing)

05:42.925 --> 05:46.846
(theme music playing)

06:45.863 --> 06:47.573
(siren wailing)

07:07.969 --> 07:10.263
There was no meltdown.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.640
A couple of power-company
transformers went out.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.308
No, it was nothing like--

07:15.476 --> 07:16.310
Howard, it's for you.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.895
Uh, what's the address?

07:17.979 --> 07:20.398
-Lieutenant Hunter.
-Lieutenant Goldblume. Hill Street.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.984
I assure you, sir, this has nothing
to do with the unthinkable.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.278
All right, ma'am,
somebody will be there right away.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.741
Leo, looting in progress,

07:31.200 --> 07:33.119
and the LaRue and the McElroy are close.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.748
Ray, the streets out there--

07:37.832 --> 07:39.750
It's a parking lot
for about a ten-block radius.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.461
Don't we have somebody in traffic control?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.921
They're on their way.
They just got their assignments.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.091
You have some people waiting
in your office.

07:48.134 --> 07:48.968
Representing?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.636
A neighborhood citizens group

07:50.720 --> 07:52.305
and the West Side Gay-Rights Committee.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.890
Did we have to put them together?

07:54.432 --> 07:56.392
Where else would you have me put them?

07:56.476 --> 07:57.977
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

07:58.269 --> 08:00.021
(sighs) I was up all night.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.690
Doctor says it's a kidney stone.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.608
You want to go home?

08:04.150 --> 08:07.695
On a day like this?
Besides, nothing will help.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.406
All I can do is wait for it to pass.

08:12.033 --> 08:12.992
Excuse me, Frank.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.370
(telephone rings)

08:16.454 --> 08:17.830
Henry, anything in the mug books?

08:18.372 --> 08:19.707
No. Neal and J.D. are at the hospital

08:19.790 --> 08:21.292
going through them
with the ones that were wounded.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.668
Good.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.800
Let me guess, the sarge's manual?

08:29.884 --> 08:30.885
Yeah. So what?

08:31.844 --> 08:35.556
You're gonna go blind.
It's only an exam, Luce.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.683
"It's only an exam."
Did you ever hear of a career?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.353
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna lose
sleep over it.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.815
Fine. You be the grasshopper
and I'll be the ant.

08:46.067 --> 08:46.901
You'll be the what?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.695
I'll be the ant, who stores food

08:50.071 --> 08:51.864
so that he has plenty of food
for the winter,

08:51.948 --> 08:52.823
and you'll be the grasshopper,

08:52.907 --> 08:56.077
who plays and never has any food
when the winter comes.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.703
-Is that a joke?
-It's not a joke.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.539
-It's not funny.
-It's not supposed to be funny.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.707
It's not a joke. It's a lesson.
It's a parable.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.376
Oh, now you're getting religious on me?

09:04.919 --> 09:07.755
Joe, there's a horse tied
to a lamppost right there.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.966
What, another parable,
the horse and the lamppost?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.217
Look, there's a horse.

09:12.843 --> 09:13.678
Let's go.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.642
(horn blaring)

09:33.322 --> 09:35.825
Are you sure Sarge meant this one?

09:35.908 --> 09:36.993
(laughing) I don't know.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.744
I think we're gonna have
to send in hoofprints

09:38.828 --> 09:40.288
to FBI headquarters.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.081
MAN: <i>Hasta luego, amigo!</i>

09:43.332 --> 09:46.544
Remember to send a voucher
directly to the studio.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.298
-Excuse me.
-Hey. Hey, you. You.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.758
Excuse me. What do you
know about this horse over here?

09:52.842 --> 09:54.385
How should I know anything about a horse?

09:54.468 --> 09:56.387
Hey, slow down, amigo. We're trying to--

09:56.470 --> 09:57.305
He's got a gun.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.140
-What's the matter with you?
-Hold it right there.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.266
Up against the wall.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.436
Can't you see it's just a prop?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.564
This is a mistake.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.400
The horse is my trusty companion.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.484
I can prove it.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.445
Diablo! Diablo!

10:12.903 --> 10:15.865
Stamp your front hoof three times.

10:19.201 --> 10:23.080
Are you supposed to be-- You are somebody.
You-- Who are you supposed to be?

10:24.749 --> 10:25.583
Diablo!

10:26.167 --> 10:28.919
Untie the reins with your teeth.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.338
You have the right to remain silent...

10:30.421 --> 10:32.590
MAN: What's the matter with you?

10:32.673 --> 10:33.883
This is a take!

10:34.759 --> 10:36.636
The Cisco Kid? It's the Cisco Kid.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.845
-That's...
<i>-Muy bien.</i>

10:38.346 --> 10:41.474
Call my agent. He can explain everything.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.685
If you so desire and cannot
afford an attorney, one will be appointed.

10:45.853 --> 10:46.687
Yo, Art.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.230
J.D., Neal.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.816
Hey, what's goin' on, Arturo?

10:51.275 --> 10:52.401
They bring you in for the blackout?

10:52.485 --> 10:53.319
Yeah.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.155
Listen, how's it goin'
with that gay thing?

10:57.031 --> 10:57.948
Any luck?

10:58.032 --> 11:00.826
A dry well, man, nothing on forensics.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.371
-Witnesses?
-No, zero on the mug shots.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.247
Did you work the first shooting?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.500
I-I thought the night-shift guy
was Andy Gerard.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.959
-Hi, Art.
-Mick.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.129
Look, uh...

11:13.464 --> 11:14.590
Can I talk to you guys...

11:16.133 --> 11:17.051
somewhere private?

11:21.305 --> 11:22.515
I was in that bar this morning.

11:25.017 --> 11:25.851
I saw him.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.145
I recognized him.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.358
His name's Vincent...

11:33.484 --> 11:34.318
First name.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.362
First name's Vincent.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.948
Uh, what were you doin' there, Art?

11:46.914 --> 11:48.666
The same thing I was doing
two weeks ago when I met him...

11:52.420 --> 11:53.504
Trying to meet a guy.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.174
-Look, Art--
-ART: Here's an apartment number.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.138
If he's, uh, if he's not there,
try The Crayfish.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.681
I met him at The Crayfish...

12:04.682 --> 12:05.516
on 34th.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.685
Dark hair...

12:08.602 --> 12:11.397
uh... medium build...

12:12.898 --> 12:13.899
mid-30s...

12:14.650 --> 12:16.986
kind of a... sharp chin.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.577
Here.

12:26.996 --> 12:27.830
Take it.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.628
We should take this to the captain.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.546
ART: You can't.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.552
Listen, just... just say
I was an anonymous informant.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.097
I'll go outside.
I'll put a dime in the pay phone.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.767
Come on, Art. If you're anonymous,
we can't get a search warrant.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.519
But you can pick him up.
You can question him.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.230
Pick him up, sweat him.
He'll crack-- I promise.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.273
MICK: Come on!

12:55.941 --> 12:57.610
I thought you were a better cop than this.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.863
Damn it, Mick! Two medals of valor
in 13 years, is that bad?

13:07.870 --> 13:08.996
I came to you guys for help.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.292
I got a wife at home. I got three kids.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.757
Neal, J.D., how long we work vice,
three years?

13:20.716 --> 13:23.385
Hell, I-I covered you guys
a couple of times...

13:23.469 --> 13:24.595
Hell, more than a couple!

13:24.678 --> 13:27.389
Hey, Art, we covered each other, huh?

13:27.848 --> 13:28.724
Please!

13:32.770 --> 13:33.604
Guys...

13:36.482 --> 13:37.733
I'm staring into a pit.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.237
Wait outside for a minute, will you?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.657
Go on.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.669
(door closes)

13:57.336 --> 13:58.295
(exhales deeply)

14:01.799 --> 14:02.633
Do you believe it?

14:03.425 --> 14:04.426
Art Bradley.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.889
Maybe we do owe him, J.D.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.975
At least ways enough
to give him half a chance.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.186
We came on the force together.
I like this guy.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.397
I feel sorry for him.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.316
Me too. I just don't believe it.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.824
Aw, hell.

14:34.957 --> 14:35.875
We'll pick him up.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.543
No promises after that.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.183
Would you mind telling us
your whereabouts last night, Vincent?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.936
Sure. I was at home.
Hey, what's all this about?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.146
Is this about those queer killings?

14:57.229 --> 14:59.440
Anyone with you at home last night?

14:59.690 --> 15:00.608
What are you inferring by that?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.651
Hey, what were you doing
in that bar just now?

15:02.735 --> 15:05.029
I told you guys, I'm a graphic designer.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.363
A client wanted me to meet him there.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.489
What's the client's name?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.326
Hey, wait a minute.
I'm not queer or nothing.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.202
What are you saying?
You never frequent that bar?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.496
Vincent, we know
you frequent The Crayfish.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.582
The hell with you and the hell with this.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.677
(shouting in foreign language)

15:37.019 --> 15:38.437
All right, you all be quiet now!

15:38.520 --> 15:40.606
Just be quiet now
and get this conversation

15:40.689 --> 15:42.441
down to a civilized level.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.151
-This man is a crook.
<i>-Si.</i>

15:44.234 --> 15:45.945
I do nothing. It's these people!

15:46.028 --> 15:48.197
We need ice for our food.
He won't sell it.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.074
I sell you ice, ten dollar!

15:50.908 --> 15:53.744
I swear, Bobby, just once
in my law-enforcement career,

15:53.827 --> 15:55.704
I would like to encounter a situation

15:55.788 --> 15:58.082
where my native tongue is an advantage.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.376
Ah-- Okay,
let's get the situation straight.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.961
-You want to buy some ice,
-Yes.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.963
-and this man won't sell it to you?
-(speaks in Korean)

16:04.046 --> 16:05.714
I sell ice, ten dollars!

16:05.798 --> 16:06.799
(arguing in foreign language)

16:06.882 --> 16:08.842
How much was ice selling for yesterday?

16:08.926 --> 16:10.761
It's not yesterday, it's today.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.763
I need ice for keep my food.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.807
Why can't you sell
these people one bag of ice

16:14.890 --> 16:17.518
-at a regular price?
-No, I need every ice!

16:18.560 --> 16:20.646
All right, you people,
you stop this squabbling!

16:20.729 --> 16:22.523
It is just too hot!

16:23.524 --> 16:25.567
(sighs) Now, you listen to me, friend.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.820
profiteering is against the law
in this state.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.447
You could get sent up for 15 years,

16:30.531 --> 16:33.534
so I suggest you sell ice
for what ice is supposed to cost.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.703
Now, this man has a store to run,

16:35.786 --> 16:39.665
and according to the state penal code,
provision 2301-A,

16:39.748 --> 16:41.417
in the event of a power failure,

16:41.500 --> 16:43.919
if you should need to purchase ice
from a store owner,

16:44.003 --> 16:46.380
you must also purchase a portion
of the food

16:46.463 --> 16:48.007
that that ice was meant to protect.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.134
Therefore, you get yourself a bag of ice,

16:50.217 --> 16:52.302
and you get yourself a pound of meat,

16:52.386 --> 16:53.637
is that perfectly clear?

16:55.222 --> 16:58.017
All right, now, I don't want
to hear one more word out of any of you.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.226
Come on, Bobby.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.063
I swear, you just have to know
how to deal with these people.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.732
You have to come with your strong suit,

17:04.815 --> 17:06.191
which is that you're smarter
than they are.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.860
Whatever you say, Renko.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.155
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Unit 2202,</i>

17:11.238 --> 17:14.074
<i>proceed to 9000 block</i>
<i>of North Park Avenue.</i>

17:14.158 --> 17:15.117
<i>Abandoned car...</i>

17:15.200 --> 17:21.832
(shouting in foreign language)

17:21.915 --> 17:23.500
Interrogation one--

17:23.584 --> 17:25.586
some guy who thinks
he's The Cisco Kid or something.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.671
In here, armpit.

17:36.055 --> 17:36.889
Captain...

17:37.639 --> 17:40.517
Captain, we got a live one
on the bar massacre.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.728
Vincent Kirby,
unemployed graphic illustrator

17:42.811 --> 17:44.146
with more than a few kinks.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.106
-Off a snitch?
-No, a phone tip,

17:46.190 --> 17:47.524
caller said he was a friend of Kirby's,

17:47.608 --> 17:49.443
described him like
one of those psycho cryptos

17:49.526 --> 17:50.819
who all of the sudden pops his cork.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.529
And we picked him up in a gay bar.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.199
All right, let's put him in a lineup.
Get his history.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.408
Priors, anything corroborative.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.327
Send his picture over
to the wounded at the hospital,

17:58.410 --> 18:00.579
and see Ray about a search warrant
for his apartment.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.706
Uh... we may have
a little problem there, Captain.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.959
The tipster called from a pay phone,
wouldn't leave his name.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.171
All we have on this suspect
is an anonymous phone tip?

18:10.297 --> 18:11.799
Yeah, I'd say we have
a little problem, J.D.,

18:11.882 --> 18:12.716
like forget the search warrant.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.052
Captain, look, I know we don't have much,

18:15.302 --> 18:17.096
but I get a real sick feeling
off of this guy.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.264
Can't we at least try
for a warrant on his crib?

18:19.556 --> 18:22.643
All right, let's try.
See what we get out of the lineup.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.144
But remember something, both of you--

18:24.603 --> 18:26.814
I want to be apprised
of all developments in this case,

18:26.897 --> 18:28.065
and that includes anonymous phone calls.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.149
You got it, Captain.

18:31.026 --> 18:35.614
The studio told me
the horse was rented for today.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.491
How was I to know

18:37.574 --> 18:39.868
the shooting schedule
had been changed to Friday?

18:42.162 --> 18:43.497
The fact that horse theft

18:43.580 --> 18:47.626
is not usually associated
with hard-core urban crime,

18:47.709 --> 18:50.462
and that the animal
was not mistreated by you in anyway,

18:51.630 --> 18:52.673
could get us a dismissal,

18:52.756 --> 18:54.967
provided we get a judge
with a sense of humor.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.762
They took away my spurs.

18:59.429 --> 19:03.642
I am financially responsible for my spurs.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.186
You think it's easy working in television?

19:08.689 --> 19:12.317
Also, it would be advisable
to downplay the wardrobe.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.486
It's never good to go
into court as The Cisco Kid.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.240
I'm not The Cisco Kid!

19:19.158 --> 19:20.033
(sighs)

19:20.701 --> 19:22.619
That is a fictional character.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.124
I am an actor, Duncan Rinaldo.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.501
I created the role.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.672
(sighing) Alan Branford,

19:33.755 --> 19:37.259
1906 Freeman Street, apartment 12.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.929
Over the last five years, AKA Jack Webb,
AKA George Reeves,

19:41.013 --> 19:44.933
AKA Robert Young, AKA Gale Storm.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.854
Detained half a dozen times
as a public nuisance.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.189
Señorita...

19:52.482 --> 19:55.402
when did your family get a television set,

19:55.485 --> 19:57.696
-the very first one?
-Mid-'50s.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.073
Do you remember the nights

20:01.241 --> 20:07.414
you would sneak out of bed
to watch Texaco Star Theater

20:07.497 --> 20:08.540
from the hallway?

20:08.957 --> 20:11.752
Tom Corbett, and it was
the top of the stairs.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.756
Mr. Branford, hear me on the subject
of your conduct in court.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.051
Extravagant behavior
could jeopardize a dismissal.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.681
It could also buy a court recommendation
that some doctors look at you.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.475
In the '50s...

20:27.976 --> 20:29.728
after the day's filming...

20:32.147 --> 20:34.149
We would drive our Studebakers

20:34.942 --> 20:37.319
out to Nicolas Canyon Beach...

20:41.865 --> 20:46.787
which is today called Leo Carillo Beach,

20:47.329 --> 20:48.872
and drink margaritas

20:50.165 --> 20:51.667
as the sun set.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.638
Hey, Lieutenant, you pass your stone?

21:04.972 --> 21:05.973
No. Why?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.684
-I don't know. I was just asking.
-Is there a pool as to what time

21:08.767 --> 21:10.310
-I will pass it?
-I don't think so--

21:10.394 --> 21:13.563
Am I approaching the time
you bet in the pool?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.107
Yeah.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.528
Leo!

21:19.611 --> 21:20.696
Huh? Me?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.283
It's my costar-- Leo Carillo.

21:25.033 --> 21:25.867
Amigo...

21:27.327 --> 21:29.037
it's good to see you again.

21:30.122 --> 21:30.956
I don't know you.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.334
I have never met you in my life.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.044
Leo...

21:37.671 --> 21:40.007
Poncho.

21:41.425 --> 21:45.095
If this is somebody's idea of a joke,
I am not amused.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.102
A man gets a beach in California
named after him,

21:52.728 --> 21:54.896
forgets he was just comic relief.

21:54.980 --> 21:55.856
Counselor, a moment.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.482
I think I may have come up
with an arrangement

21:57.566 --> 22:00.027
-that'll solve your situation.
-That's him? That's the guy?

22:00.110 --> 22:03.238
This is Mr. Comstock
from Monmouth Riding Stables.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.573
Now, he understands our need

22:04.656 --> 22:06.908
to keep officers on the street
during a blackout,

22:06.992 --> 22:08.702
so he has agreed not to press charges

22:08.785 --> 22:12.706
in return for an apology
and proper compensation.

22:12.789 --> 22:16.626
That's 12 dollars an hour,
and it was five hours, 60 bucks.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.836
I think that's reasonable.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.339
You mean...

22:21.673 --> 22:22.841
and then I could go?

22:24.092 --> 22:24.926
That's right.

22:27.012 --> 22:33.018
Because I am Duncan Rinaldo,
who is a gentleman first,

22:34.686 --> 22:37.564
I am sorry for any inconvenience

22:37.647 --> 22:40.484
caused by this misunderstanding,

22:40.817 --> 22:44.529
which was due only to the incompetence

22:44.613 --> 22:46.490
of a production manager anyway.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.618
As for the horse,

22:50.660 --> 22:54.498
it is the studio's responsibility to pay.

22:54.956 --> 22:55.791
Adios.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.751
Why don't you pay, Mr. Rinaldo?

22:57.834 --> 22:59.878
I'm sure the studio will reimburse you.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.257
Take a check?

23:06.301 --> 23:08.261
Look carefully, gentlemen,
not just at the faces,

23:08.345 --> 23:09.971
but the way they stand, the way they move.

23:12.766 --> 23:13.600
MAN: Number two.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.022
Art?

23:19.272 --> 23:20.357
This room's being used.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.359
Oh. Sorry, Frank.

23:25.028 --> 23:25.946
MAN: Number three.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.156
It was just too dark.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.700
The one on the end is the right height,

23:30.784 --> 23:32.077
but that's all.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.706
MAN: Number four.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.419
I can't tell.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.004
I-I just couldn't see.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.258
Maybe you can move the process
along even faster

23:46.341 --> 23:48.218
if you brought in a few short-order cooks.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.096
Counselor, there were no PDs available.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.722
We've had a rash
of lawbreakers around here,

23:52.806 --> 23:54.766
and half your office
was stuck in a traffic jam.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.226
Then you should've delayed the lineup.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.354
-What are you doing with him?
-We're moving him back downstairs.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.607
May I ask why, when five eyewitnesses
failed to identify him?

24:02.691 --> 24:04.234
We ran a name check.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.194
He's been in the puzzle house
twice for evaluation,

24:06.278 --> 24:08.530
and he has a prior
for lascivious carriage.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.741
(laughs) Lascivious carriage,
I'm shocked.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.495
Plus, we received a tip on him.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.123
Ah, a mysterious phone caller.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.876
Maybe he'll get back to us
about who bombed the Hindenburg.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.377
Excuse me, Miss Davenport.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.714
Frank, I've been on the phone
with the judge for 15 minutes.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.675
No way are we getting
a warrant on Kirby's place.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.302
I'm due in court.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.513
When I get back,
I want Kirby charged or gone.

24:36.516 --> 24:40.145
Captain, you're not
kickin' him loose, are you?

24:40.228 --> 24:41.813
It's under serious consideration.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.106
We got to have more time.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.734
What for? There's gonna be
no warrant issued,

24:46.151 --> 24:47.152
and the lineup was a zero.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.446
Ah... we want to go talk to his neighbors.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.405
That's no reason to hold him.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.574
Lean with us a little
on this, will you, Captain?

24:53.033 --> 24:53.992
-Why?
-Well,

24:54.075 --> 24:56.077
we don't have all the mug-book results yet

24:56.161 --> 24:57.662
from the victims down at County.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.456
One of the guys was still in surgery.

24:59.539 --> 25:00.874
The guy's got priors, Captain.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.086
Talk to the neighbors, right away.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.926
Hey, I mean it, J.D.,
somebody IDs the guy, that's one thing,

25:11.009 --> 25:12.594
but what we're doing now is lame.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.304
In for a buck, in for a bundle, Mick.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.181
Either we help Art Bradley, or we don't.

25:16.264 --> 25:19.434
I like him, too, John, but he's a cop.
He's got responsibilities.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.479
Hey, there he is. Right over there, J.D.

25:22.896 --> 25:23.855
Uh-huh.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.362
-Gentlemen.
-Hey, Willie, my man!

25:30.445 --> 25:32.322
What do you say, huh? Hey!

25:32.989 --> 25:35.534
You know I ain't pulled a B&amp;E
since the day you busted me.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.868
That's real good, Willie.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.206
You want to look
inside my coat, don't you?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.458
No, Willie, I want you
to jump up and down for me.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.335
I'll tell you what-- I'll jump with you.

25:45.418 --> 25:48.964
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey, this is fun, huh?

25:49.047 --> 25:51.174
Jump higher. It's exercise, huh? Come on.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.092
Oh!

25:52.717 --> 25:55.637
-Oh, oh, my.
-Oh! Willie,

25:55.720 --> 25:56.805
-my man.
-What's the matter, eh?

25:56.888 --> 25:58.640
Ain't you guys ever seen
five people in love?

25:58.723 --> 26:00.767
And a schoolyard only a block away, huh?

26:00.850 --> 26:01.893
Hey, you boys are rough.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.729
First you bust me
for the thing I'm good at,

26:04.813 --> 26:06.856
and now you won't let me
pick up a few nickels.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.985
Willie, you can keep your pictures...

26:10.485 --> 26:13.154
and you can buy yourself
an awful lot of future goodwill.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.282
How's that?

26:15.824 --> 26:17.117
NEAL: By doing what you're good at.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.705
You want me to break into someplace?

26:21.788 --> 26:23.498
Yeah, a room on 88th.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.750
Look for an assault rifle.
Don't get any prints on it.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.836
Uh, guys, excuse me.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.379
Excuse us, would you pl-- Come here.

26:30.005 --> 26:30.839
Stay.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.593
This is wrong. I'm out.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.177
Hey, come on, Mick. Not now, man.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.887
-No, I said I'm out.
-That's just great.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.724
Hey, on behalf of Art Bradley
and his entire family,

26:40.807 --> 26:42.183
thanks a hell of a lot.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.518
Hey, that's great.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.188
Your own man's hinky.
Well, I'm hinky, too.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.988
No room for you to be hinky, Willie.
Sorry about that.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.909
Now, we want you to make
a whole lot of noise

26:59.993 --> 27:01.411
so the super can hear you, okay?

27:01.786 --> 27:02.662
Then we'll show up.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.581
Hey, but I could go to jail.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.958
Well, not if you don't get Miranda,
you can't.

27:07.584 --> 27:08.752
Sometimes we forget.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.838
Whatever happens,
you're deaf and dumb, you got it?

27:12.088 --> 27:12.922
Yeah.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.007
An hour.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.343
Tops.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.054
(exhales)

27:20.680 --> 27:22.182
Cops and robbers, babe.

27:22.891 --> 27:23.808
Cops and robbers.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.106
Yeah! Come on!

27:30.190 --> 27:32.942
Yeah, mama! Hey!

27:33.234 --> 27:34.694
Come on! Come on!

27:35.028 --> 27:36.571
Come on down here!

27:36.821 --> 27:39.658
Come on, daddy! All right!

27:39.741 --> 27:41.034
Hey, hey, buddy! You're gonna have

27:41.117 --> 27:42.994
-to get out of the street.
-God bless you, Officer.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.621
-You gonna have to get out of the street.
-I'm responsible!

27:44.704 --> 27:46.623
-Renko, take care of him.
-I'm too smart...

27:46.706 --> 27:47.624
-Come on!
-You're gonna get off the street.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.710
I started this morning,
the whole city goes back.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.463
-It's all my fault! In my heart--
-What has that got to do with anything?

27:53.546 --> 27:55.674
Aah! (indistinct chatter)

27:55.757 --> 27:56.966
-(tires screeching)
-Hey, man!

27:57.050 --> 27:59.636
What's wrong with you? Turn around!

27:59.719 --> 28:02.305
-Get out of here!
-Get up. Get up.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.515
MAN: I'm getting up.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.642
(crying)

28:05.725 --> 28:07.268
All right, go away.

28:07.602 --> 28:10.230
Get up on that curb
and go off this street right now.

28:13.358 --> 28:17.737
Hey! I am buck naked!

28:18.988 --> 28:20.532
(siren wails)

28:20.615 --> 28:22.992
(alarm ringing)

28:26.162 --> 28:29.416
Yeah, this is unit 2203
requesting immediate backup.

28:29.499 --> 28:33.420
We have a 407 in progress
at Dekker and 117.

28:33.795 --> 28:34.796
-WOMAN (on radio): <i>Roger.</i>
-Do you want to wait?

28:34.879 --> 28:36.840
-No.
-Just a suggestion.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.800
Come on.
They got the stuff in their hands.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.600
All right!

28:48.935 --> 28:52.564
Okay, up against the wall.
Put the stuff down on the ground.

28:52.647 --> 28:53.982
I don't want to have to tell you
more than once.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.150
Forget you!

28:55.233 --> 28:56.776
Yeah, what are you gonna do, shoot us?

28:56.860 --> 28:59.154
Don't do anything stupid.
Nobody has to get hurt.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.865
-Yeah, you got that right.
-Hey, hey, you just drive away.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.199
This is our business!

29:03.283 --> 29:04.367
Hey, the hell it is.

29:05.326 --> 29:08.288
Just because there's a power failure
doesn't mean the laws are canceled.

29:08.371 --> 29:11.499
Yeah, they're canceled.
What are you gonna do about it?

29:12.375 --> 29:13.209
(gun cocks)

29:14.461 --> 29:15.795
you ain't gonna do that.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.424
Joe...

29:25.722 --> 29:27.682
Diablo, <i>ándele!</i>

29:29.642 --> 29:30.477
<i>Ándele!</i>

29:30.894 --> 29:32.103
MAN: He's crazy, man.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.606
<i>Ándele!</i>

29:37.817 --> 29:38.651
-Back!
-Hold it!

29:39.527 --> 29:42.447
(indistinct shouting)

29:42.530 --> 29:43.448
-Move!
-MAN (on speaker): All right!

29:43.531 --> 29:45.950
On your bellies! On your bellies!

29:46.826 --> 29:47.660
Down!

29:50.121 --> 29:53.708
Hands behind your back.
No quick or unnecessary movements.

29:55.126 --> 29:58.671
Complete cooperation
or extensive hospitalization

29:58.755 --> 30:00.757
is your current choice of options.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.258
Should we go after him or what?

30:02.634 --> 30:04.177
I mean, which way did he go?

30:04.928 --> 30:06.596
I don't know,
but I'd sure like to thank him.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.265
Lieutenant, we got it--

30:10.225 --> 30:11.392
the weapon in those bar murders.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.896
Incredible. We show up for a little Q&amp;A
at the suspect's building.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.815
The super here comes running out,

30:16.898 --> 30:19.150
tells us somebody's ripping off
Kirby's apartment.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.318
Get it to ballistics.

30:20.401 --> 30:21.986
Get prints and run the numbers.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.571
Tell them it's priority on everything.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.531
Got it?

30:24.614 --> 30:26.115
Okay. Let's get his prints
for a cross-check, huh?

30:26.199 --> 30:27.659
Take a seat, jerk face.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.410
Looks like our luck's changing, Captain.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.539
All the looting, this guy's pulling a job
in Kirby's apartment--

30:32.622 --> 30:33.998
steals his rifle.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.625
I heard these noises upstairs,

30:35.708 --> 30:36.876
and I knew the cops were in the building.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.336
So when I saw the guy on the stairs,

30:38.711 --> 30:40.171
I grabbed him and I started yelling.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.048
Does this mean
we get to hold Kirby, Captain?

30:42.131 --> 30:43.508
-Ballistics?
-Already working.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.301
I want to know as soon as we have results.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.601
Henry, where is Miss Davenport?

30:54.435 --> 30:57.689
They arrested that <i>estúpido</i>
cowboy again in the Heights!

31:00.650 --> 31:01.484
Hi.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.405
Hi. How are you?

31:06.406 --> 31:07.282
Well, uh...

31:08.366 --> 31:09.284
I've been better.

31:13.538 --> 31:14.414
What can I do for you?

31:16.249 --> 31:17.625
Get a divorce and marry me?

31:21.379 --> 31:25.216
Frank... I wanted so much
to have natural childbirth.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.010
But, you know, Paul Grogin
doesn't want to be seen with me,

31:27.093 --> 31:28.970
so I don't have a delivery partner, and...

31:30.346 --> 31:33.141
Well, I'm really beginning to think
the whole thing's a horrible mistake.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.102
Oh, if you've come this far--

31:36.185 --> 31:37.812
No, really, Frank.

31:38.521 --> 31:41.274
I'm afraid that something terrible
is gonna happen.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.406
I just don't want to be alone right now.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.202
Uh, if-if you're looking for
a surrogate partner, Fay,

31:53.286 --> 31:56.623
-I just can't be that for you right now.
-I wasn't gonna ask.

31:56.915 --> 31:57.832
(knock on door)

31:59.626 --> 32:00.877
I'm sorry. Uh...

32:01.878 --> 32:03.338
Can I have a glass of water?

32:03.421 --> 32:04.464
Oh, sure.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.177
Uh... just a minute, Irwin.

32:10.929 --> 32:11.930
Just a minute, Irwin.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.149
(clears throat)

32:24.275 --> 32:25.193
(sighs)

32:26.653 --> 32:28.363
A lot of generations
have come into the world

32:28.446 --> 32:29.781
without natural childbirth.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.200
Yeah, and look at us.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.412
All I wanted was to be awake this time.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.998
It's gonna be my last baby.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.626
I just wanted to know what it was like.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.927
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.312
(sniffling)

33:08.695 --> 33:09.529
Thanks, Henry.

33:11.948 --> 33:12.782
HENRY: What's the matter?

33:14.701 --> 33:16.828
Oh, you know how moody pregnant women are.

33:17.537 --> 33:18.371
It's nothing.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.707
(sighs) Fay...

33:24.377 --> 33:27.005
I wanted to have natural childbirth
with my baby.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.841
They won't let you
take the training without a partner?

33:32.635 --> 33:35.263
As I recall, it doesn't have to be
the real father,

33:35.346 --> 33:36.973
just as long as it's somebody...

33:38.141 --> 33:38.975
I know.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.311
Well, I'm somebody.

33:45.023 --> 33:45.857
You?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.693
I did it with Annie.
It was a great experience.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.069
I always wanted to do it again.

33:51.237 --> 33:52.071
Honestly?

33:52.530 --> 33:53.489
Sure, I'd love it.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.451
Oh!

33:57.160 --> 33:59.996
Oh, Henry Goldblume! (chuckles) Ah!

34:00.788 --> 34:02.248
-Ohh!
-Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.792
(laughing)

34:13.760 --> 34:14.594
Right.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.142
RAY: Aah!

34:22.351 --> 34:23.227
We can give him priority.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.357
We got a matchup on the Uzi, Captain.
Kirby's our man.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.610
Fabulous. We got him.

34:30.693 --> 34:31.861
FRANK: Great. Good work.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.529
Excuse me, gentlemen.

34:34.781 --> 34:38.201
My latest client informs me
your detectives failed to Mirandize him,

34:38.284 --> 34:40.453
both on arrest and subsequently.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.997
-Who did?
-LaRue and Washington.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.499
Laporta's as good as on the street.

34:47.919 --> 34:48.795
You forgot?

34:49.253 --> 34:50.296
I thought Neal did it.

34:50.755 --> 34:51.631
Sorry, Captain.

34:53.883 --> 34:55.760
And just so you know,
I'm getting Willie a new attorney.

34:55.843 --> 34:58.513
I don't want a conflict
with my defense of Vincent Kirby.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.264
What does that mean?

35:01.140 --> 35:03.226
I believe Laporta's
ultimately going to be charged

35:03.309 --> 35:05.645
with felonious conspiracy
in collusion with regard

35:05.728 --> 35:07.897
to his acquisition of Mr. Kirby's weapon.

35:07.980 --> 35:08.898
News to me, Joyce.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.610
That'll be my contention
at Mr. Kirby's trial.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.821
I'm going to get an exclusion

35:14.904 --> 35:17.448
on every piece of evidence
Laporter stole for you.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.742
Hey, he didn't steal anything for us.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.662
He got busted
because the super heard him breaking in.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.372
By two cops
who couldn't even get a warrant!

35:30.628 --> 35:32.255
Think you can sell the coincidence, Irwin?

35:33.798 --> 35:34.632
They happen.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.885
Try to sound that convinced at the trial.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.681
-Where you going, Irwin?
-Calling my boss.

35:49.272 --> 35:52.108
You were the officers
on two of Laporter's priors.

35:53.109 --> 35:57.405
Laporter just happens to be burglarizing
the apartment of a murder suspect.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.573
You just happened to be downstairs

35:58.656 --> 36:00.825
-talking to a couple of neighbors.
-Captain, we thought that--

36:00.908 --> 36:03.411
We get a piece of evidence
that nails the suspect to the floor,

36:03.494 --> 36:04.662
a piece of evidence we wouldn't have

36:04.745 --> 36:06.956
except for the break-in,
but Laporter walks

36:07.039 --> 36:09.000
because you forget to read him his rights.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.293
Hey, it was an oversight.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.170
It stinks! I don't believe it.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.006
You two aren't lazy cops,
and until now,

36:15.089 --> 36:16.132
-I didn't think you were stupid.
-(knocking on door)

36:16.215 --> 36:17.508
What the hell's going on?

36:17.717 --> 36:20.136
Excuse me, Captain.
I'm just back from County.

36:20.219 --> 36:23.431
Negative on the last guy
that could have ID'd Kirby.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.099
It was Kirby's rifle
that did the killings.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.810
-Great.
-But there's an A-1 chance

36:28.102 --> 36:31.272
we might lose the gun as evidence
because of the dicey way it was acquired.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.773
-The DA says kick him.
-Excuse me, Irwin.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.984
He says somewhere down the road,
the gun is sure to be excluded.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.319
What the hell's the matter with you?

36:36.402 --> 36:39.655
-Hey, kiss my butt, Bernstein!
-I want full statements from both of you,

36:40.031 --> 36:42.742
every detail of your involvement
with the arrest of Willie Laporta.

36:42.825 --> 36:43.826
You got our reports, Captain.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.828
FRANK:
I want them signed. I want them sworn.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.873
I don't know what the hell
else is at stake here,

36:48.956 --> 36:49.999
-but it better be worth your badges.
-Hey, Captain--

36:50.082 --> 36:51.500
Thirty minutes. Both signatures.

37:00.009 --> 37:01.344
The guy's a nut. Release.

37:01.427 --> 37:02.678
-Put him under high-profile--
-I'm not gonna release.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.055
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Put him under high-profile...

37:04.138 --> 37:05.640
-I'm not gonna release!
-...maybe he'll crack!

37:05.973 --> 37:08.434
-What do you think you're gonna do?
-Let me get my detectives' statements.

37:15.775 --> 37:18.194
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.340
(clears throat) Mick...

37:40.758 --> 37:41.884
Don't talk to me.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.225
(sighs)

37:52.561 --> 37:53.771
We're in deep sewage, Neal.

37:55.147 --> 37:56.691
What we did's a felony, babe.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.360
Lying about it is a felony, too.

37:59.443 --> 38:01.445
Man, if we could only count
on Willie Laporta

38:01.529 --> 38:03.614
to do the right thing
and give the right story.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.284
Mm... it's still a perjury, babe,
him and us.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.037
(sighs)

38:11.539 --> 38:13.499
All the falls
I could have taken in my career,

38:13.582 --> 38:15.251
I'm gonna buy it for Art Bradley.

38:19.046 --> 38:19.880
(knock on door)

38:21.465 --> 38:22.466
Minute for me, Frank?

38:23.092 --> 38:23.926
Sure.

38:30.808 --> 38:33.019
I understand you got some
detectives writing statements.

38:33.561 --> 38:34.395
And?

38:36.147 --> 38:37.815
Why do you need statements from them?

38:37.898 --> 38:40.943
With all due respect, Art,
that's not a question you get to ask.

38:42.903 --> 38:46.532
Just... just seems like we're treating
them like some kind of wrong guys.

38:46.615 --> 38:47.616
You're out of line.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.411
Your assignment was the power outage.

38:57.626 --> 38:58.669
Frank?

38:59.837 --> 39:02.840
I got reason to know that they're correct.
They popped the correct guy.

39:03.883 --> 39:04.842
How do you know?

39:04.925 --> 39:06.677
A friend of mine was there.
He saw the shooting.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.554
These-these guys are just trying
to help him out.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.057
-Your friend?
-Right.

39:11.515 --> 39:12.433
Help them out how?

39:13.976 --> 39:14.810
He's a cop.

39:19.023 --> 39:19.899
He's homosexual.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.193
He can't come forward.

39:22.943 --> 39:25.863
That's why J.D. and Neal--

39:25.946 --> 39:28.032
My-my friend begged him
not to use his name.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.035
Don't-don't bust them for trying to help.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.537
Art...

39:36.123 --> 39:37.666
Your friend has to come forward.

39:38.876 --> 39:39.710
He can't.

39:40.252 --> 39:41.087
He has to.

39:42.671 --> 39:43.547
He's got a wife...

39:45.174 --> 39:46.008
A family.

39:48.844 --> 39:49.678
Art.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.241
I was at the bar.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.496
Kirby came in, and...

40:16.414 --> 40:17.373
He never even saw me.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.375
He went into the bathroom,

40:20.459 --> 40:21.293
and when he came out,

40:22.420 --> 40:23.587
he just started shooting.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.883
People were screaming, dying.

40:29.468 --> 40:31.137
My gun was in the car.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.596
I ran after him.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.641
I ran to my car to get my weapon...

40:38.477 --> 40:39.311
But he was gone.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.277
I left.

40:47.820 --> 40:48.654
(knock on door)

40:51.365 --> 40:54.118
Uh... Captain, uh...

40:54.994 --> 40:56.537
We'd like to explain the situation.

40:56.620 --> 40:57.913
I think Art's doing that.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.500
Frank, this case is made on ballistics.

41:01.792 --> 41:03.377
The guy's print is on the piece.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.212
Let J.D. and Neal just testify

41:05.296 --> 41:06.755
that they recovered the gun
after a burglary.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.884
A day like today, a power outage,
must be a million burglaries.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.063
They're out of it.

41:23.647 --> 41:24.815
I'm not gonna let them testify,

41:24.899 --> 41:26.400
I'm not gonna use anything
they brought in,

41:26.484 --> 41:27.902
and I'm sure as hell
not gonna let that guy go.

41:30.154 --> 41:30.988
I can't do it.

41:31.322 --> 41:34.283
Can't do what?
Can't testify against a murderer?

41:34.700 --> 41:36.952
Sign a complaint to keep
a murderer off the streets?

41:37.286 --> 41:38.579
You do it, Art, or I will.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.831
I'll sign the complaint.
I'll name you the witness.

41:41.373 --> 41:42.750
I'll deny I said anything to you.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.669
I don't have any motive for lying, Art.

41:46.253 --> 41:47.129
It's gonna come out.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.756
It ought to come from you.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.515
Miss Davenport,

41:58.182 --> 42:00.476
I understand your client's
committed this offense

42:00.559 --> 42:01.685
twice today.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.229
Nevertheless...

42:03.562 --> 42:06.565
I feel tempted to let the court
get onto more serious business

42:06.649 --> 42:07.983
on these conditions.

42:08.067 --> 42:09.360
The studio told me

42:09.902 --> 42:13.113
I was to be the next Gilbert Roland,

42:13.822 --> 42:17.076
and then they put me in a younger picture.

42:17.618 --> 42:19.203
That was a crime.

42:19.787 --> 42:23.040
Your Honor, we'd be willing to comply
with anything the court has in mind.

42:25.125 --> 42:28.504
I'd like the accused to promise
that he'll never take another horse

42:28.587 --> 42:30.839
he hasn't rented, bought,

42:30.923 --> 42:31.966
or taken in trade.

42:32.049 --> 42:34.510
I was robbed in syndication!

42:36.136 --> 42:41.642
I also got nothing for the cap pistols
or the autographed lunch pails.

42:45.437 --> 42:47.898
(light laughter)

42:49.650 --> 42:51.944
All right... I promise.

42:52.695 --> 42:55.739
Adjourned...
with contemplation of dismissal.

42:56.949 --> 42:57.783
Bailiff.

42:59.034 --> 43:01.912
-BAILIFF: Docket number 070--
-JUDGE: How did it go?

43:02.955 --> 43:04.290
You know, the opening narration

43:04.373 --> 43:06.875
when The Cisco Kid was riding
through the desert...

43:08.002 --> 43:11.130
"Return-- Return with us now

43:11.213 --> 43:14.925
to those thrilling days of yesteryear."

43:15.259 --> 43:17.636
That was <i>The Lone Ranger.</i>

43:19.638 --> 43:20.931
Oh, that's right.

43:22.683 --> 43:23.517
That's right.

43:28.105 --> 43:31.734
MAN: Your Honor, you should note
a minor readjustment...

43:31.817 --> 43:33.944
It hurts me to see you this way, Pancho.

43:35.362 --> 43:39.408
Maybe someday you'll get another series.

43:41.577 --> 43:42.411
Adios, amigo.

43:43.370 --> 43:48.500
Docket number 07095, Your Honor.
Vincent James Kirby.

43:49.168 --> 43:52.379
Three counts of 499 in the penal code,
murder in the first degree.

43:53.422 --> 43:55.007
The complainant is Francis Furillo.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.676
The defendant is on
for arraignment and bail setting.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.804
Representation is provided
by the public defender's office.

44:00.888 --> 44:01.805
Where the hell is Bradley?

44:01.889 --> 44:03.432
We don't need him
for an arraignment, Irwin.

44:03.515 --> 44:05.601
-We need him for a trial.
-What the hell's the point of arraign--

44:07.019 --> 44:09.271
You tie my hands and feet.
You make me work with my hands tied.

44:09.355 --> 44:10.939
Bail application, Miss Davenport.

44:11.690 --> 44:13.859
I'd suggest a very low bail, Your Honor.

44:13.942 --> 44:17.071
Mr. Kirby would be crazy to go anywhere
given the state's case.

44:17.154 --> 44:19.657
We believe we have the right man,
Your Honor. We'd ask--

44:19.740 --> 44:21.325
Do you believe you have any evidence?

44:22.451 --> 44:23.869
Yes, we certainly do.

44:23.952 --> 44:25.162
Anything you can use?

44:25.704 --> 44:27.498
Your Honor, we are not in discovery here.

44:28.290 --> 44:29.291
Now, we have a signed complaint--

44:29.375 --> 44:31.460
JOYCE: Yes, signed by Captain Furillo,

44:31.543 --> 44:34.296
who was told by Detective Bradley,
a hearsay witness.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.799
Perfectly acceptable
for the present proceeding, Your Honor.

44:36.882 --> 44:38.092
All right, Mr. Bernstein,

44:38.175 --> 44:40.135
but now we're at the question of bail.

44:40.219 --> 44:42.262
-Can you be a little more forthcoming?
-Who are they saying saw me?

44:42.346 --> 44:45.140
-Be quiet.
-Are they accusing me of homosexuality?

44:46.308 --> 44:47.726
Is that what this is turning into?

44:47.810 --> 44:48.644
JUDGE: Mr. Kirby...

44:49.144 --> 44:51.772
I'm trying to determine
whether you should receive bailments,

44:51.855 --> 44:55.317
and, if so, to determine the amount.
Now, please, keep still.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.568
One question, Your Honor.

44:56.944 --> 44:57.778
One question.

44:59.071 --> 45:02.199
Has this society become
a breeding ground for perversion?

45:03.659 --> 45:05.369
Is that the instruction we're under?

45:05.452 --> 45:07.955
-(bangs gavel)
-Be still now and let me get this settled.

45:08.539 --> 45:09.540
Mr. Bernstein...

45:09.832 --> 45:11.250
six people are dead.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.712
My inclination is toward
high bail or remand.

45:15.254 --> 45:17.464
On the other hand,
I'm hearing allegations here

45:17.840 --> 45:19.758
that the state's case
is without substance.

45:20.050 --> 45:22.010
Can you give me some broad indication?

45:22.094 --> 45:24.847
Our case is our case, Your Honor.

45:25.055 --> 45:29.351
-Hearsay?
-I demand to know who saw me.

45:29.435 --> 45:31.103
-(gavel bangs)
-JUDGE: Now, I said be still, sir.

45:31.562 --> 45:33.147
I'll sign the complaint, Your Honor.

45:34.815 --> 45:36.024
JUDGE: You are?

45:37.359 --> 45:41.238
Detective Arthur Bradley,
Hill Street Station.

45:45.868 --> 45:46.785
And I was there.

45:46.994 --> 45:47.911
KIRBY: Who's that?

45:49.913 --> 45:51.081
Some faggot?

45:51.915 --> 45:53.459
Yeah, the one who's sending you away.

45:54.168 --> 45:57.463
-(gavel bangs)
-Held without bail, 72-hour return date.

45:59.381 --> 46:01.800
BAILIFF: The court will now take
a 15-minute recess

46:01.884 --> 46:03.302
at the request of Judge Cole.

46:03.385 --> 46:05.471
All those present are asked to move out...

46:07.014 --> 46:07.848
Art...

46:10.267 --> 46:11.101
Thanks.

46:11.977 --> 46:12.936
Makes the case.

46:13.395 --> 46:15.397
Look, why don't you try
to take this one step at a time?

46:15.481 --> 46:16.482
The worst may be over.

46:17.649 --> 46:18.484
(sighs)

46:19.610 --> 46:21.945
Come on, Frank. I'm finished.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.280
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

46:23.363 --> 46:26.241
You're protected by civil law,
by department policy.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.619
They'll always find some way
to get rid of someone like me.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.829
Don't presume other people's judgments.

46:32.080 --> 46:34.792
I've seen a lot of judgment
in my time on the force, Frank.

46:36.168 --> 46:37.544
"A fag walks into a bar..."

46:38.337 --> 46:39.713
"A fag walks into a beauty salon..."

46:40.005 --> 46:41.298
Jokes my friends used to tell.

46:42.549 --> 46:43.383
My buddies...

46:45.052 --> 46:46.303
Jokes I told myself.

46:48.013 --> 46:49.515
I think maybe you're overreacting.

46:50.432 --> 46:51.517
Tell it to my wife!

46:52.059 --> 46:53.185
Tell it to my children!

46:53.894 --> 46:56.563
I've got a 14-year-old boy
going out for football, Frank.

46:56.855 --> 46:57.981
Tell it to him!

47:03.987 --> 47:04.947
Excuse me.

47:10.994 --> 47:12.913
REPORTER:
<i>Although electric power has been restored</i>

47:12.996 --> 47:15.791
<i>to most of the city,</i>
<i>there are still areas...</i>

47:15.874 --> 47:17.918
What are you going to do
about your detectives?

47:19.127 --> 47:20.921
Well, it's a complicated situation.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.631
They thought they were
helping out a friend.

47:23.882 --> 47:24.967
That sounds like nothing.

47:26.510 --> 47:27.511
What if it costs you Kirby?

47:28.887 --> 47:30.472
That's hypothetical, counselor.

47:32.224 --> 47:34.268
In fact, they did no irreparable harm.

47:35.477 --> 47:37.563
They had the opportunity to recant,
and they took it.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.815
Few enough chances for mercy.

47:42.609 --> 47:46.113
<i>He was identified as Arthur Bradley,</i>
<i>a detective at Hill Street Station</i>

47:46.196 --> 47:48.949
<i>and two-time winner</i>
<i>of the department's medal of valor.</i>

47:49.032 --> 47:51.869
<i>A police-department spokesman</i>
<i>would not comment on speculation</i>

47:51.952 --> 47:55.122
<i>that Bradley had a prior</i>
<i>personal relationship with the accused,</i>

47:55.205 --> 47:58.250
<i>except to say that Bradley was off duty</i>
<i>at the time of the incident</i>

47:58.333 --> 48:01.378
<i>and was not on official police business</i>
<i>while at The Elbowroom,</i>

48:01.461 --> 48:04.089
<i>a bar that caters</i>
<i>primarily to homosexuals.</i>

48:04.715 --> 48:05.549
(click)

48:05.632 --> 48:06.842
They're gonna crucify him.

48:23.233 --> 48:26.028
(closing theme playing)
