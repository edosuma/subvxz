You said you'd support me
on my fitness journey.

00:29.346 --> 00:31.346
Journey to where?
I feel like I'm gonna croak.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.866
-Keep hydrating.
-CAM: And remember,
if you can't make it burn,

00:34.017 --> 00:36.702
you can't make it firm.

00:38.188 --> 00:38.871
Dig deep.

We're more than halfway there.

Get those booties up.

GIA:
He's over here.

01:38.507 --> 01:39.823
He went down
in the middle of class.

01:39.916 --> 01:41.007
He's breathing,

01:41.102 --> 01:42.250
but we couldn't
get him to wake up.

01:42.344 --> 01:43.685
-Okay, Chim?
-CHIMNEY: On it.

01:46.181 --> 01:48.089
HEN:
That ankle is definitely
sprained or broken.

01:48.167 --> 01:49.924
That happen before
or after he passed out?

01:50.018 --> 01:51.944
After. Something
was wrong with him.

01:52.095 --> 01:53.670
Maybe it's that thing
that happens,

01:53.689 --> 01:55.096
when your thighs poison you?

01:55.190 --> 01:56.673
-Rhabdomyolysis?
-We see a lot of it.

01:56.692 --> 01:58.117
Muscle tissue breaks down
and releases protein

01:58.344 --> 02:00.010
into the bloodstream.

02:00.028 --> 02:02.103
I feel like my thighs have been
poisoning me my whole life.

02:02.272 --> 02:03.956
BP is elevated. 145/97.

02:04.183 --> 02:06.516
He's tachycardic,
with a pulse of 132,

02:06.535 --> 02:07.701
but I don't think
he's having a heart attack.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.110
Could be physical exertion.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.520
He was going pretty hard
when this happened?

02:10.614 --> 02:12.022
Yeah, it came on suddenly.

02:12.115 --> 02:14.115
His lips and skin look dry.
Could be severe dehydration.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.783
Starting a line
and running a bolus of saline.

02:15.803 --> 02:16.951
Over here, guys.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.545
Dehydration?
That doesn't make any sense.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.214
Everyone's been hydrating
this whole time.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.033
-And that's water?
-It's better than water.

02:23.051 --> 02:25.035
It's Cam Lewis's Taut Tummy Tea.

02:25.128 --> 02:26.628
SHAR:
They did a pretty hard sell
on it when we first signed up

02:26.796 --> 02:28.296
-for the class.
-Uh-huh.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.982
(grunts)
I feel like I'm on fire!

02:30.133 --> 02:32.709
You're okay. We're just flushing
your system with saline.

02:32.728 --> 02:34.820
Try to relax.

02:35.564 --> 02:37.138
SHAR:

WOMAN:
Something in the tea.

02:43.906 --> 02:44.979
-You got her head?
-Whoa!

-EDDIE: Dehydration,

02:46.575 --> 02:48.667

02:48.894 --> 02:50.076
CHIMNEY:
Whoa, whoa.

02:50.229 --> 02:51.837
Hey, we got another one.

02:52.064 --> 02:54.080
All right. Dispatch,
this is Captain Nash, 118.

02:54.233 --> 02:55.899
I'm at 625 Beverly,
we're gonna need

02:56.068 --> 02:57.083
additional paramedic units.

02:57.236 --> 02:58.993
We have multiple victims

02:59.013 --> 03:00.679
who are suffering
from tachycardia,

03:00.906 --> 03:02.264
dehydration and fainting.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.759
This Tummy Tea, what's in it?

03:05.911 --> 03:09.337
Uh, 50 milligrams of B-3
per serving, and magnesium.

03:09.506 --> 03:10.689
Uh, how much of this
did she drink?

03:10.916 --> 03:12.024
A packet has two servings.

03:12.251 --> 03:13.934
BUCK:
Okay, so that's 100 milligrams.

03:14.028 --> 03:17.362
A woman her size should be
having 14 milligrams.

03:17.589 --> 03:20.757
So she's taking in 7.13 more
times than the daily allowance.

03:20.776 --> 03:22.868
Did he just do math?
In his head?

03:23.095 --> 03:23.777
I think so.

03:23.929 --> 03:25.871
Uh, was I, was I right?

03:26.022 --> 03:27.431
You were.

03:27.449 --> 03:29.875
And given that amount of B-3,

03:30.102 --> 03:32.269
I think we're looking
at acute niacin toxicity.

03:32.287 --> 03:34.028
-Hydration all around?
-(cups clatter)

03:34.122 --> 03:36.965
-WOMAN: Oh!
-Immediately.

03:41.405 --> 03:43.447
Nothing like plain old water.

03:43.465 --> 03:44.631
BOBBY:
Yeah.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.142
Everything old is new again.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.227

04:06.247 --> 04:07.988
-(sighs) Just barely.
-(chuckles)

04:08.082 --> 04:10.323
I'm used to you doing
your workouts at the firehouse.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.251
Well, I used to run more
before I hurt my back.

04:12.327 --> 04:14.753
Some 10Ks and stuff, but, uh...

04:14.922 --> 04:16.738
Wendall was always
trying to get me out there.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.573
Said it'd be good way for me
to connect with the world.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.166
I thought it would be a good way
to remember him.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.335
Well, the next time you're out
there running through the world,

04:22.488 --> 04:24.912
-you should invite me along.
-Really?

04:24.932 --> 04:27.173
Well, I didn't know
that you liked to run.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.934
Oh. I used to do it
in high school.

04:29.085 --> 04:30.769
-I thought you were
a cheerleader.
-(scoffs)

04:30.996 --> 04:32.996
I also ran cross-country.

04:33.015 --> 04:35.015
Well, you still manage
to surprise me.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.833
Mm-hmm. Mm, mm, mm.

04:36.852 --> 04:38.852
Why don't you find a way
to surprise me

04:38.928 --> 04:40.261
after you take a shower.

04:40.355 --> 04:42.506
What-- you don't--
you don't want some of this?

04:42.599 --> 04:44.741
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

04:45.602 --> 04:46.510
(door opens)

04:46.528 --> 04:49.204
-Whew. (chuckles)
-(door closes)

04:51.366 --> 04:52.273
Hey.

04:52.367 --> 04:53.292
-Hey.
-I heard you guys

04:53.519 --> 04:55.018
-had quite the morning.
-(sighs)

04:55.037 --> 04:57.111
I missed the bus,
then Mama's car wouldn't start

04:57.131 --> 04:59.539
on the one day Mom's in Barstow
for a meeting.

04:59.691 --> 05:02.116
Well, when it rains, it pours,
am I right?

05:02.136 --> 05:04.044
I should probably tell
your ma that I'm here.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.379
Oh, I'm not sure
you want to go in there.

05:06.532 --> 05:07.639
Right.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.182
Thanks for the warning.

05:10.869 --> 05:12.369
I heard your dad was in town.

05:12.538 --> 05:13.628
Yeah, he was.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.373
But he has gone back
to Korea, thankfully.

05:16.391 --> 05:18.208
You didn't like having him here?

05:18.301 --> 05:22.712
It's not that exactly,
it's just... complicated.

05:22.731 --> 05:26.383
Because you and your dad
don't really get along.

05:26.401 --> 05:29.402
I heard my moms
talking about it.

05:29.555 --> 05:32.313
-Right.
-But what happened?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.575
Why is it so complicated?
I mean, it's your dad.

05:35.727 --> 05:38.395
Yeah, he's my dad.

05:38.413 --> 05:40.321
Parents aren't perfect,
you know?

05:40.415 --> 05:42.082
They're just regular people
who make mistakes,

05:42.234 --> 05:45.993
and sometimes they hurt you
even if they don't mean to.

05:46.088 --> 05:48.088
I guess I'd be pretty mad
if my dad hurt me.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.740
I mean, if I knew him.

05:50.759 --> 05:52.184
Right.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.019
But you know, being mad at
someone for most of your life,

05:54.170 --> 05:56.021
it's pretty exhausting,
and I was tired

05:56.248 --> 05:57.747
carrying all that around.

05:57.766 --> 05:59.024
So you forgave him?

05:59.175 --> 06:02.919
I made my peace
and I let myself move on.

06:02.938 --> 06:05.438
You did what you needed to.

06:05.591 --> 06:07.348
For yourself.

06:07.368 --> 06:08.724
That's right.

06:08.726 --> 06:11.444
Sometimes you got to take care
of yourself first.

06:11.597 --> 06:13.521
You know,
you're a pretty smart kid.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.781
-Hey.
-(Hen scoffs)

06:14.875 --> 06:17.100
-W-When did you get here?
-Just now.

06:17.193 --> 06:19.269
You know, we're pretty late
already, so you should

06:19.271 --> 06:21.605
probably just say thank you
and get in the car, Hen.

06:21.698 --> 06:22.606
(exhales):
Thank you.

06:22.699 --> 06:25.442
Come on, let's go.

06:25.460 --> 06:26.868
Come on.

06:26.962 --> 06:29.871
<i> CHRISTOPHER:</i>
<i> What's the square root of 162?</i>

06:29.965 --> 06:31.448
Well, it's not a perfect square.

06:31.466 --> 06:35.376
So that would be 12.727,
I think.

06:35.470 --> 06:37.062
That's right.
This is awesome, Dad.

06:37.289 --> 06:39.898
-Buck knows everything.
-Yeah, yeah.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.642
Not everything.
I-I think it's just math stuff.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.311
Today, on the way to work,
I was able to calculate

06:45.464 --> 06:47.406
exactly how many gallons of gas

06:47.482 --> 06:49.408
I needed to get myself
to the firehouse.

06:49.635 --> 06:53.486
-Why not just fill it up?
-Because figuring it out
was more fun.

06:53.639 --> 06:55.138
Turns out, I love math.

06:55.231 --> 06:56.415
Well, according to this,

06:56.566 --> 06:58.232
people can get
new cognitive abilities

06:58.252 --> 07:00.326
after a serious injury
to the central nervous system.

07:00.479 --> 07:02.328
-Ooh, which I-I definitely had.
-Mm.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.906
But some doctors are saying
it's not a real thing.

07:04.983 --> 07:07.909
Uh, you-you think I've secretly
known the square root of 162

07:07.928 --> 07:09.836
all these years
and just been holding out?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.989
No, come on.
It-it has to be the lightning.

07:13.082 --> 07:13.915
Fair point.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.249
This guy literally got

07:15.343 --> 07:19.162
the power of electricity
after being struck.

07:19.214 --> 07:20.346
Said the lights
would turn on and off

07:20.499 --> 07:22.332
every time he walked
into a room.

07:22.501 --> 07:23.833
-Cool.
-Yeah.

07:23.852 --> 07:25.944
Didn't last.
Only lasted a few weeks.

07:26.171 --> 07:27.687
I wish I got something
like that.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.781
You know, ESP, or...

07:30.008 --> 07:31.858
maybe the ability
to see into the future

07:31.952 --> 07:33.768
or read people's minds.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.195
EDDIE:
Mm...

07:35.289 --> 07:36.846
Those sound like
horrible powers to have.

07:37.015 --> 07:38.682
Maybe this is just
the first phase.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.201
Maybe you'll get more powers
the stronger you get.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.020
Yes, like an actual superhero.

07:44.039 --> 07:45.613
You did get stuck by lightning.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.025
-Classic origin story.
-So, what are you gonna do

07:49.044 --> 07:50.618
-with your newfound superpowers?
-Ooh.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.287
He could give me the answers
to my math homework.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.214
Uh-uh.

07:54.366 --> 07:56.216
-Uh-uh-uh-uh.
-(chuckles)

07:56.368 --> 07:58.810
You're never gonna learn
if he gives you the answers.

07:58.962 --> 08:01.295
I'm the guy with the answers.

08:01.389 --> 08:03.690
I kind of like it.
(chuckles)

08:08.547 --> 08:09.562
(exhales):
Okay.

08:09.639 --> 08:11.806
Purse. Ooh.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.117
Keys.

08:15.887 --> 08:17.237
(gasps)
Hi, there.

08:17.313 --> 08:18.722
-Hi.
-(phone ringing)

08:18.815 --> 08:20.147
Oh. One sec.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.292
Phone. Uhp.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.004
Hey, Josh. Yeah, I'm sorry.

08:26.081 --> 08:27.321
I'm running late. The struggle
was real getting Jee

08:27.341 --> 08:28.732
out of the house this morning.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.233
Do I have the what? Oh, yes.

08:30.252 --> 08:31.584
The book. I have it.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.011
Okay, see you soon.

08:33.162 --> 08:34.921
-Well, hi.
Do we know each other?
-Hi.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.073
I'm Carol Sykes.
I live two doors down.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.833
Blue house, pink mailbox.
(chuckles)

08:38.927 --> 08:40.760
I'm sorry we haven't met yet.

08:40.912 --> 08:42.095
I was out of town.

08:42.264 --> 08:44.247
I just got back and heard
the news that someone

08:44.266 --> 08:45.506
had moved into the house.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.100
I had to see who it was.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.936
-Well, now is not a good time.
-The place looks incredible.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.197
I love that you kept
the original detail.

08:52.348 --> 08:54.591
-Thank you.
-And I'm sorry you're in a rush,

08:54.609 --> 08:56.276
'cause I brought muffins.

08:56.428 --> 08:58.036
They're my grandma's old recipe.

08:58.187 --> 09:00.280
Yeah, that is,
that is too bad, but...

09:00.432 --> 09:02.766
Oh! You have a little one.
How old?

09:02.934 --> 09:04.934
-Uh, two.
-My Brent is three.

09:05.028 --> 09:07.695
I should bring him
for a playdate.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.289
Here. You take this.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.700
I'll give you my number,

09:12.719 --> 09:15.445
and we will get it on the books.

09:15.463 --> 09:16.780
-Yeah, sure. (chuckles)
-Okay?

09:16.873 --> 09:18.557
-There you go.
-Thank you.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.708
Oh, no, you hold on to those.
You'll thank me later.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.302
-Okay? Okay.
-Yep.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.787
-Got to go.
-All right, got to--
got to go.

09:23.805 --> 09:25.638
(laughs)
Bye-bye!

09:25.791 --> 09:27.399
-Bye!
-Bye-bye.

office five times to no avail.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.082
Well, maybe it requires
a personal touch.

-Yeah.

10:06.514 --> 10:09.090
Speaking of things that are not
ours, where did this come from?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.609
That belongs to Carol.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.110
-Carol?
-Mm-hmm.

Two doors down.
"Blue house, pink mailbox."

10:15.023 --> 10:17.173
-Never heard of her.
-She came by to say hello

10:17.192 --> 10:18.283
and brought some muffins.

10:18.434 --> 10:19.692
-Hmm.
-So I took them to work.

10:19.861 --> 10:21.119
So, what do we think
of this Carol?

10:21.196 --> 10:24.180
She's odd, kind of pushy,

10:24.182 --> 10:25.698
and really wants me
to have coffee with her.

10:25.851 --> 10:28.017
Seems like maybe she doesn't
have a lot of friends.

10:28.036 --> 10:29.777
-You feel bad for her?
-A little.

10:29.855 --> 10:31.946
You know what, I'm just gonna
take this dish back

10:31.965 --> 10:33.206
and I'm gonna say thank you,

10:33.375 --> 10:35.258
-to Carol.
-All right.

10:42.217 --> 10:43.975
(knocking on door)

10:46.796 --> 10:48.647
Hi. Can I help you?

10:48.874 --> 10:50.223
Oh, hi. I'm looking for Carol.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.151
I have her pan and I just
wanted to give it back to her.

10:53.302 --> 10:56.303
I'm Carol,
but that's not my pan.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.114
Oh, uh...

11:01.027 --> 11:02.810
Maybe I have
the-the wrong house.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.995
I'm looking for Carol Sykes.

11:04.147 --> 11:08.249
That's me,
but that's still not my pan.

11:15.750 --> 11:16.900
BOBBY:
So Carol's<i> not</i> Carol?

11:16.993 --> 11:19.235
No. Real Carol has lived
in that house

11:19.328 --> 11:21.587
for the past three years
with her husband Bill. No kids.

11:21.740 --> 11:24.407
-And none of these neighbors
know who this woman really is?
-Truthfully,

11:24.500 --> 11:26.576
-most of the neighbors
don't know who<i> we</i> are.
-Oh.

11:26.594 --> 11:27.911
-A friendly bunch, huh?
-Real Carol

11:27.929 --> 11:29.262
said they've had
a lot of house flippers

11:29.356 --> 11:31.748
on the block,
so they tend to wait six months

11:31.841 --> 11:33.249
to a year to see if people stay.

11:33.268 --> 11:34.842
Did this imposter

11:35.011 --> 11:37.103
-ever take anything
or ask for any money?
-No.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.513
But she did mention a playdate
with her kid and Jee-Yun.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.699
(sighs)
Great.

11:40.926 --> 11:42.183
Another thing
I have to worry about.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.684
I'm thinking
maybe she was casing the joint,

11:43.778 --> 11:44.944
looking around, seeing

11:45.038 --> 11:46.687
what was there so
she could come back later.

11:46.707 --> 11:47.931
So much more comforting.

11:48.024 --> 11:49.615
Though why bring muffins
and leave a dish behind?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.710
She left a dish behind?
There could be fingerprints.

11:51.786 --> 11:53.619
I don't think that would survive
going through the dishwasher.

11:53.772 --> 11:55.121
Eh. Well, I guess the only thing

11:55.215 --> 11:56.530
left to do is call
somebody in law enforcement.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.383
Perhaps you
and "law enforcement"

11:58.534 --> 12:00.276
could come over
to our place for dinner?

12:00.295 --> 12:01.886
We could put our heads together
and try and crack the case?

12:02.113 --> 12:03.138
We would love to.

12:03.965 --> 12:07.708
535,694...

12:07.802 --> 12:09.210
-point-three-eight.
-Man.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.563
-Okay. Come on, pay up.
Let me see it.
-Yeah.

12:11.714 --> 12:13.139
BUCK:
Let's go. Thank you.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.808
-Woo-hoo!
-Easy money.

12:15.977 --> 12:18.144
-Yeah.
-A fool and his money
are soon...

12:18.296 --> 12:19.645
-parted.

12:19.798 --> 12:20.905

12:23.301 --> 12:24.909

means "idiot" in French.

heals hair shafts

14:33.689 --> 14:36.949
and protects the hair
from any heat damage

-from the torch.

15:09.134 --> 15:10.933
Okay, dispatch said
the fire's out,

15:10.985 --> 15:11.984
but there was a lot of smoke.

15:12.137 --> 15:13.152
People panicked.

15:13.304 --> 15:14.987
So we've got
some slip-and-fall injuries

15:15.140 --> 15:17.398
and one person with an allergic
reaction of some kind.

15:17.492 --> 15:18.917

It's actually pretty cool.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.995
He's the "Scissors, where?" guy.

15:23.148 --> 15:25.314
Think I figured out
where the scissors are.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.259
-MAKELA: Over here!
-BOBBY: There's
our allergic reaction.

15:28.411 --> 15:30.670
Right over there. Sir,
you doing okay? Can you get up?

15:30.764 --> 15:33.723
-Take a seat over there. We'll
have somebody check you out.
-(wheezing)

15:34.935 --> 15:36.676
Hang in there.
You're gonna be all right.

15:37.495 --> 15:40.346
Heart rate is 120. BP's 139/85.

15:40.498 --> 15:42.440
Her breath sounds
are diminished with wheezing.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.759
Was she burned or did she inhale
a lot of smoke?

15:45.853 --> 15:46.945
Uh, no, it's the water.
She's allergic.

15:47.096 --> 15:48.429
You don't see that every day.

15:48.523 --> 15:49.280
What is that called?

15:49.432 --> 15:51.174
It's aquagenic urticaria.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.118
It's rare, but it usually
affects girls in this age group.

15:55.196 --> 15:57.789
Pressure from the sprinklers
probably made it worse.

15:57.865 --> 15:59.015
Let's try to get her dried off.

15:59.108 --> 16:01.117
-I'll start a line.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.025
sorry, Mom. I...
(labored breathing)

16:09.043 --> 16:10.526
just wanted to do something...

16:10.619 --> 16:11.636
on my own.

16:11.863 --> 16:14.222
(labored breathing)

16:15.550 --> 16:16.716
Is she going to be okay?

16:16.868 --> 16:18.534
She's stable.

16:18.627 --> 16:20.536
-You can ride along.
-Maybe this wouldn't
have happened if she felt

16:20.555 --> 16:24.040
-like she could talk to me.
-You can't do that to yourself.

16:24.058 --> 16:25.708
Kids are utterly unpredictable

16:25.801 --> 16:27.226
when they're trying to figure
out who they are.

16:27.378 --> 16:30.238
The best we can do is show up
for them when they need us.

Come on.

16:45.230 --> 16:47.839
What do you mean
Denny wasn't on the bus?

16:47.990 --> 16:49.507

16:49.658 --> 16:51.250
-He wasn't on it.
<i> -Okay, well, is there</i>

forgot to put on the calendar?

<i> in months.</i>

16:59.019 --> 17:01.060

getting home then?

17:02.689 --> 17:05.172
Hen. Hen.

17:05.266 --> 17:06.265
Wh...

17:06.359 --> 17:07.416
Wh... Denny!

17:07.435 --> 17:08.675
-Mama?

17:08.695 --> 17:10.586
Oh, my God. Oh.

17:10.755 --> 17:11.937
Karen, he's here.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.865
<i> -I got him.</i>
-He's where?

17:14.016 --> 17:15.258
<i> I'll call you back.</i>

17:15.351 --> 17:16.425
What happened?

17:16.444 --> 17:17.893
They were driving
through an intersection,

17:19.447 --> 17:22.932
Uh, hit the driver's side pretty
hard. Your son seems fine,

might need surgery.

Uh...

18:01.915 --> 18:03.656

18:03.732 --> 18:04.773

18:06.327 --> 18:08.920

is. We weren't doing

18:28.850 --> 18:31.609

You don't have to protect me
from my own father.

Whom you didn't even know
before a few months ago.

18:37.842 --> 18:38.674

18:41.937 --> 18:43.454

(scoffs)

18:43.606 --> 18:44.789

-Yeah. Seems like a lot
of people feel the same way.

19:17.565 --> 19:20.549
The phone number she left
is operational.

19:20.568 --> 19:22.067
But it's a burner phone.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.069
Which means we can't track it
or have any idea

19:24.164 --> 19:25.979
-who owns it.
-I just don't understand
what she wants.

19:26.148 --> 19:27.832

shows up with muffins

19:27.983 --> 19:29.834

19:32.397 --> 19:33.913

19:34.065 --> 19:35.656
They usually ask for money.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.508
Say that the car broke down
or it was towed

19:37.735 --> 19:39.326
and they need cash.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.327
That works?

19:40.405 --> 19:41.662
Sometimes.

19:41.756 --> 19:43.906
I mean, there's usually
a sob story that goes with it

19:43.999 --> 19:45.683

19:45.834 --> 19:48.260
I mean, they ask for
small amounts, maybe 50 bucks,

19:48.413 --> 19:50.021
so people are more likely
to give it to them.

19:50.172 --> 19:52.690
But she didn't ask me
for anything.

19:52.917 --> 19:54.083
Except my time.

19:54.101 --> 19:55.842
It could be
that she's casing the place

19:55.937 --> 19:57.177
for a future robbery.

19:57.271 --> 19:59.030

26:54.855 --> 26:58.098
All these months, Denny just

26:58.117 --> 27:00.342
lying to our faces.

27:00.361 --> 27:03.120
Running around behind our backs.

27:03.271 --> 27:05.289
I don't like this feeling.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.135
(knocking on door)

27:18.362 --> 27:19.637
Oh...

27:19.788 --> 27:21.546
-Oh.
-Hi.

27:21.699 --> 27:22.714
Mm.

27:22.791 --> 27:23.957
Where's my grandson?

27:24.051 --> 27:25.384
In his room, on a hunger strike.

27:25.536 --> 27:29.054
We're entering a whole
'nother phase of parenthood, Ma,

27:29.206 --> 27:30.630
and it feels like nothing
we've experienced before.

27:30.724 --> 27:33.542
It feels like we're being
run over by a freight train.

27:33.635 --> 27:36.545
I swear, I've never met
a kid so stubborn.

27:36.638 --> 27:39.156
Oh, I have.
You're married to her.

27:39.383 --> 27:41.575
(laughs)

27:42.720 --> 27:46.071
But... don't worry.

27:46.148 --> 27:47.647
You're in luck.

27:47.667 --> 27:52.127
I happen to be
a stubborn child whisperer.

27:58.736 --> 27:59.826
(knocking on door)

27:59.920 --> 28:02.495
TONI:
Honey? It's Grammie.

28:02.589 --> 28:04.072
I come in peace

28:04.166 --> 28:07.333
and I have snacks.

28:07.428 --> 28:09.103
Come in.

28:13.250 --> 28:15.934
Figured you might be
a little hungry.

28:16.028 --> 28:19.113
I heard you haven't
been eating much.

28:19.848 --> 28:22.257
PB and J, no crust.

28:22.276 --> 28:24.702
And a strawberry milk.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.006
Thanks, Grammie.

28:39.793 --> 28:41.885
I'm sorry about your father.

28:42.037 --> 28:45.705
You know, your moms love you

28:45.725 --> 28:48.467
very much.

28:48.561 --> 28:52.971
But sometimes,
when we love somebody,

28:53.065 --> 28:55.958
we can hold on
a little too tight.

28:55.976 --> 28:58.794
Especially when
they're our children.

28:58.887 --> 29:01.387
They hate me, don't they?

29:01.482 --> 29:05.325
Honey, hate
is a very strong word.

29:07.137 --> 29:09.229
Are they upset?

29:09.248 --> 29:10.748
Yeah.

29:10.899 --> 29:12.666
Disappointed?

29:13.644 --> 29:14.977
Absolutely.

29:15.070 --> 29:20.315
But I also think
they're a little scared.

29:20.484 --> 29:21.759
Of what?

29:21.986 --> 29:24.669
Of you getting hurt.

29:24.764 --> 29:27.656
Losing you.

29:27.674 --> 29:29.658
My dad wouldn't hurt me.

29:29.676 --> 29:32.919
He loves me, just like they do.

29:33.013 --> 29:35.105
Well, I think that's something

29:35.332 --> 29:39.334
they're gonna have to see
for themselves, in time.

29:39.427 --> 29:42.354
All I wanted was to know my dad.

29:42.506 --> 29:44.364
Oh, honey.

29:45.359 --> 29:47.267
I know.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.195
And I think they do, too.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.456
There's nothing wrong

29:52.607 --> 29:55.775
with you wanting
to know your dad.

29:55.795 --> 30:00.589
We just have to go about this
the right way.

30:23.047 --> 30:25.564
Oh, thank goodness.
Please, come in.

30:25.716 --> 30:27.825
-I was afraid
they wouldn't send anyone.
-(Patsy screaming)

30:27.976 --> 30:29.159
HEN:
You told dispatch

30:29.311 --> 30:31.811
-your wife was injured?
-She's, uh... This way.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.163
RALPH:
I wanted to take her to the ER,

30:33.315 --> 30:35.165
-but every time
I tried to move her...
-(moans)

30:35.392 --> 30:37.225
Oh, no. You called 911?

30:37.394 --> 30:39.077
-I told you I was going to.
-I told you not to.

30:39.229 --> 30:41.079
I wasn't gonna let you die
on the couch.

30:41.231 --> 30:42.822
Better than dying
from embarrassment.

30:42.916 --> 30:45.901
Hi, I'm Hen. What's your name?

30:45.994 --> 30:47.177
-Patsy.
-Okay, Patsy.

30:47.329 --> 30:49.179
Can you describe
the pain for me?

30:49.331 --> 30:50.906
It's kind of a stabbing,

30:50.999 --> 30:53.666
uh, combined with some shooting.

30:53.686 --> 30:56.502
Gets worse when I mo...
Aah!

30:56.522 --> 30:58.246
-Move.
-(buzzing)

30:58.248 --> 31:00.148
W-What is that buzzing?

31:02.419 --> 31:04.436
I-I swear to God,
I don't know how it happened.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.088
We were having
a romantic evening,

31:06.090 --> 31:08.031
-and then..
-(Patsy grunting)

31:08.183 --> 31:10.275
Okay. O-Okay, Patsy.
I'm gonna have you lie back here

31:10.427 --> 31:13.662
so I can figure out
what's going on.

31:16.266 --> 31:18.000
(buzzing continuing)

31:19.861 --> 31:22.212
The buzzing's coming from...

31:22.439 --> 31:24.530
-inside the house.
-Uh...

31:24.625 --> 31:27.792
EDDIE:
I get you were having
a romantic evening, sir, but...

31:27.887 --> 31:30.612
what exactly were you doing

31:30.614 --> 31:31.871
when the pain started?

31:31.965 --> 31:32.556
We were, um,

31:32.725 --> 31:34.874
you know, being intimate?

31:34.894 --> 31:36.785
EDDIE:
Just the two of you?
Uh, the old-fashioned way?

31:36.803 --> 31:38.211
RALPH:
I may have

31:38.230 --> 31:40.213
purchased something newfangled

31:40.307 --> 31:42.958
to, uh, increase her pleasure.

31:42.976 --> 31:44.568
-Yeah, l-like-like a...
-(screams)

31:44.795 --> 31:46.811
-(Patsy moaning)
-RALPH: Yes.

31:46.964 --> 31:47.979
Yeah, we were having
a really good time.

31:48.132 --> 31:51.633
She seemed happy,
so I was happy.

31:51.726 --> 31:54.002
And then I kind of lost it.

31:54.805 --> 31:56.488
That's when
the screaming started.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.640
I think it's moved
into her bladder.

31:58.733 --> 31:59.824
I'll get the morphine.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.952
My bladder? Can you get it out?

32:02.179 --> 32:03.828
Afraid we can't do that
on this couch.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.405
We're gonna need to get you
to the ER.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.649
And tell this humiliating story
to new people. Great.

32:07.668 --> 32:09.985
If it makes you feel any better,
they've all heard it before.

32:10.154 --> 32:11.762
Thank you.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.080
-It doesn't.
-RALPH: I'm so sorry, honey.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.100
I just wanted to make sure
you were happy.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.511
So, this could happen to anyone?

32:19.663 --> 32:21.663
Uh, well, um...

32:21.682 --> 32:23.774
Listen, uh, t-they probably sell

32:23.925 --> 32:25.667
50 million of these
every single year.

32:25.686 --> 32:28.670
You know, h-half as many people
buy blenders,

32:28.763 --> 32:31.356
and there's 7,000 blender
accidents a year, so...

32:31.508 --> 32:34.009
the probability of
a-an accident like yours is...

32:34.027 --> 32:35.786
0.03%.

32:35.862 --> 32:37.603
Oh, God.

32:37.698 --> 32:39.047
I just read this article.

32:39.107 --> 32:41.774
"Is your partner
less satisfied than you think?"

32:41.794 --> 32:44.202
They said 80% are not satisfied.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.112
I've only ever been with Patsy.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.689
They did not seem
like good numbers for me.

32:47.691 --> 32:49.207
For you? F-For anyone.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.875
Uh, boy, if I do the math

32:51.044 --> 32:54.379
on all the women I've been with,
that's... wow.

32:54.531 --> 32:55.864
EDDIE:
Buck?

32:55.882 --> 32:57.215
-Let's move her.
-Uh, oh.

32:57.367 --> 32:59.142
I'll grab the gurney.

33:01.463 --> 33:02.980
(moans)

33:05.800 --> 33:07.693
-(metal thuds)
-(shouts)

33:10.897 --> 33:12.972
It's gonna be a long ride
to the ER.

33:12.992 --> 33:15.066
Let's try to avoid potholes.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.120
(Patsy groans)

33:26.672 --> 33:29.080
No, no, I-I did
want to call you sooner.

33:29.233 --> 33:30.749
I-I thought I'd lost
your number,

33:30.901 --> 33:33.326
and then I-I found it again.
I think I got a new phone.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.070
But I just wanted
to check with you...

33:35.088 --> 33:36.680
You think he's gonna call every
woman he's ever slept with?

33:36.831 --> 33:39.516
(laughs) Uh, assuming
that he remembers their names.

33:39.743 --> 33:41.560
-(chuckles)
-(phone chimes)

33:44.672 --> 33:46.097
Everything okay?

33:46.191 --> 33:49.584
I guess Nathaniel's
doing better.

33:49.677 --> 33:51.010
He's ready for visitors.

33:51.088 --> 33:53.255
(sighs)
I don't envy that conversation.

33:53.423 --> 33:55.532
You figure out what
you're gonna say yet?

33:55.759 --> 33:56.849
"I'm glad you're not dead.

33:56.927 --> 33:58.035
What the hell
were you thinking?"

33:58.203 --> 34:00.620
(chuckles) Sounds like
a good place to start.

34:02.599 --> 34:03.932
Carol, hi.

34:03.950 --> 34:06.710
-Glad you could make it.
-I was so glad to get your call.

34:06.861 --> 34:09.104
-This is my son Brent.
-Hi, Brent.

34:09.122 --> 34:11.247
-Nice to meet you.
-It's a nice day out.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.276
Maybe the kids could play
out in the courtyard.

34:14.294 --> 34:15.610
Oh, where's your daughter?

34:15.703 --> 34:17.370
Oh, she's still napping.
She went down late.

34:17.464 --> 34:19.431
Oh, not a problem.
We don't mind waiting,

34:19.616 --> 34:20.873
do we, Brenty?

34:20.893 --> 34:22.951
He's so excited to meet her.

34:22.953 --> 34:25.562
Yeah, it's nicer when they have
friends in the neighborhood.

34:25.713 --> 34:28.714
Unfortunately, I feel like
I don't know anyone.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.808
You're not missing much.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.235
They're a tough bunch.

34:32.462 --> 34:33.719
Very judgy.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.965
-Uh, do I smell cinnamon rolls?
-You do. (laughs)

34:36.983 --> 34:38.742
I should probably go and check
on them and my daughter.

34:38.969 --> 34:41.561
Can you guys just entertain
yourselves for a few minutes?

34:41.580 --> 34:44.564
Oh, no problem. I'm sure
we can find something to do

34:44.583 --> 34:46.083
while you're gone.

35:00.657 --> 35:02.099
(mouthing)

35:20.510 --> 35:21.785
Hey, Maddie?

35:21.936 --> 35:24.362
I'm gonna run home.
Brent's not feeling well.

35:24.514 --> 35:26.681
MADDIE:
Oh, if you just hang on a sec,
I can walk you out.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.200
Oh, I'm fine. I know the way.

35:29.369 --> 35:30.544
(gasps)

35:32.856 --> 35:35.632
You need a hand with all that?

35:52.967 --> 35:54.967
So this was all about mail?

35:55.061 --> 35:56.544
Coupons, actually.

35:56.638 --> 35:58.880
Carol's real name
is Rhonda Fitzsimmons,

35:58.882 --> 36:00.323
and she's a coupon forger.

36:00.550 --> 36:03.551
-A what?
-She forges coupons
and sells them online.

36:03.570 --> 36:05.978
Mm-hmm. Deep discounts
on hot items.

36:05.998 --> 36:07.647
Bargain hunters can't resist.

36:07.741 --> 36:10.909
Even if the deals seem
a little too good to be true.

36:11.077 --> 36:13.411
I'm guessing
that's a cash business.

36:13.563 --> 36:15.630
Money orders.

36:17.659 --> 36:18.750
Mailed to your address.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.326
Wha... How did she pick us?

36:20.420 --> 36:23.254
Well, she actually did live
in the house down the street.

36:23.331 --> 36:25.240
But she sold it to Carol
to pay for her legal fees

36:25.333 --> 36:28.576
the last time she was arrested
for fraud and forgery.

36:28.595 --> 36:31.003
Just got out of prison
a month ago.

36:31.097 --> 36:32.689
And decided to start up
the old hustle again.

36:32.916 --> 36:34.098
But why did she send
the mail here?

36:34.193 --> 36:35.750
She didn't want to take the risk
of having the money

36:35.843 --> 36:36.935
mailed to her own home.

36:37.087 --> 36:39.845
That's how she got caught
the last time.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.681
So she decided to use
the address of a house

36:41.700 --> 36:42.941
she thought was abandoned.

36:43.093 --> 36:44.534
ATHENA:
I spoke with her parole officer.

36:44.761 --> 36:46.352
She's in violation,

36:46.371 --> 36:48.854
so she is headed back to prison,

36:48.949 --> 36:51.115
along with
a few extra years now.

36:51.268 --> 36:53.952
-What about her son?
-Nephew, actually.

36:54.104 --> 36:56.604
He's safely home
with his mother.

36:56.623 --> 36:58.289
She's never gonna let her sister
watch her son again.

36:58.442 --> 37:01.218
Wow, I would be furious at Buck.

37:01.369 --> 37:03.611
Every family's different.

37:03.630 --> 37:05.222
(exhales)

37:05.873 --> 37:08.207
I know this look.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.118
I actually agree with you.

37:10.136 --> 37:11.619
I think it was
very irresponsible

37:11.713 --> 37:14.213
of Denny to see Nathaniel
behind your backs.

37:14.233 --> 37:17.292
Anything could have happened,
and it kind of did.

37:17.310 --> 37:18.810
I also agree with Denny.

37:18.962 --> 37:23.147
He has a right to a relationship
with his father if he wants one.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.724
He's a child, Ma.

37:24.801 --> 37:27.577
He can't fully understand
what he wants.

37:27.729 --> 37:29.579
Didn't you? I was the one

37:29.731 --> 37:31.414
who took you to dinners
we couldn't afford

37:31.641 --> 37:33.641
because I could see
your heart was broken

37:33.810 --> 37:37.570
when there was a daddy-daughter
dance you couldn't go to.

37:37.664 --> 37:39.314
Toni, I get it,

37:39.332 --> 37:42.575
but Nathaniel hid a relationship
with our son from us.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.745
Feels a little soon to be
extending an olive branch.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.264
Then when? When he's dying

37:47.415 --> 37:50.842
and Denny's a virtual stranger?

37:50.994 --> 37:52.176
Is there something
we're not doing?

37:52.271 --> 37:55.179
Is that why he wants
a relationship with Nathaniel?

37:55.274 --> 37:57.607
He loves you both so much.

37:57.759 --> 38:01.427
I don't think there's any one
thing you could do differently

38:01.521 --> 38:05.189
that would replace the feeling
he gets from having a father.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.509
I don't think
we're ready for this.

38:07.602 --> 38:09.844
Denny is.

38:09.863 --> 38:12.530
And that should be
the only thing that matters.

38:12.607 --> 38:14.124
Honey.

38:15.368 --> 38:18.295
Don't repeat the mistakes
of the past.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.140
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

38:36.464 --> 38:39.274
Hey. Come on in.

38:40.134 --> 38:41.651
Thanks for coming.

38:41.803 --> 38:45.229
How are you, uh, feeling?

38:45.382 --> 38:47.699
Like I got hit by a car.

38:47.884 --> 38:50.994
Same, honestly.

38:51.905 --> 38:54.739
I never meant for this
to go so far.

38:54.891 --> 38:56.240
Can you even fathom

38:56.393 --> 38:58.501
what it was like
to get a call that your son

38:58.728 --> 39:01.987
wasn't on the school bus,
and to find him at the hospital?

39:02.082 --> 39:05.342
You have to know
this wasn't my intention.

39:05.493 --> 39:06.901
I was selfish.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.253
But it felt so good
to have a son.

39:09.406 --> 39:14.351
Someone that was part of me,
who needed me.

39:14.502 --> 39:16.077
He sought me out.

39:16.096 --> 39:18.188
I let the feeling
of having him in my life

39:18.339 --> 39:19.839
cloud my better judgment.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.583
And that is inexcusable.

39:21.601 --> 39:24.435
I wish I could go back
and fix it.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.437
You can't.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.722
He's such a special kid.

39:28.724 --> 39:30.758
You two have done

39:30.852 --> 39:33.261
an amazing job with him.

39:33.354 --> 39:36.781
I'm sorry about
how all this happened,

39:36.950 --> 39:39.784
but I'm glad I got to know him.

39:39.936 --> 39:42.295
Even if it's just a little bit.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.868
KAREN:
We'll need to establish

39:48.887 --> 39:51.012
some serious ground rules.

39:52.465 --> 39:53.973
What?

39:55.394 --> 39:57.118
Denny loves you.

39:57.137 --> 39:58.544
However that happened.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.289
And we don't want
to take that away from him.

40:01.382 --> 40:05.068
So we will have to establish
a path forward.

40:05.295 --> 40:06.961
KAREN:
Which is not gonna be easy.

40:06.980 --> 40:09.313
We had an agreement
and you broke it.

40:09.466 --> 40:12.242
Our trust is not
a commodity you have.

40:12.393 --> 40:13.910
You will have to earn it.

40:14.061 --> 40:15.537
I will.

40:16.564 --> 40:18.063
I promise.

40:18.158 --> 40:20.658
I will never keep anything
from you guys again.

40:20.810 --> 40:21.901
Thank you.

40:22.028 --> 40:24.737
Let me be clear.
This is not for you.

40:24.831 --> 40:26.147
This is for him.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.259
And the minute you cross
the line again, it's done.

40:29.486 --> 40:31.094
Permanently.

40:31.245 --> 40:35.414
Our son, our rules.

40:35.508 --> 40:37.392
I understand.

40:47.762 --> 40:49.003
BUCK:
So, when I cook,

40:49.172 --> 40:50.855
I like to measure out
all my ingredients.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.283
That makes me feel
like I'm an actual chef.

40:53.359 --> 40:54.659
That makes me your sous-chef.

40:54.844 --> 40:56.194
Yes, it does.

40:56.346 --> 40:58.896
Okay, sous-chef, uh,
let's measure this out.

40:59.048 --> 41:00.348
We need to make enough cookies

41:00.366 --> 41:04.127
for your whole class,
so we should triple that recipe.

41:04.278 --> 41:06.537
-This is metric.
-Uh, let me see.

41:06.706 --> 41:08.948
Here.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.801
Okay, that's fine.
Uh, 185 grams of flour,

41:11.953 --> 41:13.803
triple that is 555 grams,

41:13.955 --> 41:17.699
which is 4.4345 cups.

41:17.717 --> 41:20.477
Huh. You know, uh...

41:20.628 --> 41:23.387
Maybe we should just
find a new recipe online.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.482
Can we have cookies for dinner?

41:25.633 --> 41:27.800
Well, I thought maybe
we'd have some steak

41:27.894 --> 41:28.968
and then cookies.

41:29.136 --> 41:30.545
You know what a porterhouse is?

41:30.563 --> 41:33.381
Buck, I'm from Texas.

41:33.399 --> 41:34.657
(chuckles)

41:35.552 --> 41:36.826
-(exhales): Ooh.
-BOBBY: Well,

41:37.053 --> 41:38.402
I did not see that coming.

41:38.555 --> 41:41.889
-Ugh.
-Road in front of me
was on fire. You are fast.

41:41.908 --> 41:43.741
Come on,
it's not like we were racing.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.076
Well, thank goodness.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.819
Otherwise you would have
left me six blocks behind.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.564
Oh, it felt good. I just wanted
to see if I still had it.

41:49.657 --> 41:52.750
-Oh, you definitely still do.
-Mm-hmm.

41:52.902 --> 41:54.326
-Ah, ah, ah, ah. Ah!
-What?

41:54.420 --> 41:55.845
We are filthy.

41:55.997 --> 41:58.422
-Okay? I'm hitting the showers.
-Ugh.

41:58.517 --> 42:00.099
(sighs)

42:01.761 --> 42:04.245
You know,
the best thing about

42:04.264 --> 42:08.399
getting dirty together
is getting clean together.

42:18.261 --> 42:21.079
-You ready?
-Yep.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.001
NATHANIEL:
Hey.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.963
(indistinct chatter)

42:30.623 --> 42:33.049
Are we ready?

42:33.200 --> 42:34.884
Not even a little bit.
