<i>10 teams continued racing
through Cartagena, Colombia.</i>

00:06.902 --> 00:08.686
<i>Erin faced her biggest fear.</i>

00:08.791 --> 00:10.390
Oh, I'm so claustrophobic.

00:10.391 --> 00:11.910
(WHIMPERS)

00:11.911 --> 00:13.350
Anything to get us out of here.

00:13.351 --> 00:17.110
<i>At the Detour, Tyler and Korey
exploded to the front of the pack...</i>

00:17.111 --> 00:19.110

00:19.111 --> 00:20.270
Gracias! Gracias!

00:20.271 --> 00:21.750
<i>...while Zach and Rachel
came up short.</i>

00:21.751 --> 00:22.950
13, 14...
-Babe, we didn't do enough.

00:22.951 --> 00:24.230
I'm so sorry, babe.

00:24.231 --> 00:27.350
<i>A Roadblock showdown
for first place</i>

00:27.351 --> 00:29.470
<i>ended with Brodie and Kurt on top.</i>

00:29.471 --> 00:32.070
You are team number one!
(BOTH CHEER)

00:32.070 --> 00:33.910
Let's go!
-Whoo!

00:33.911 --> 00:35.870
<i>Meanwhile,
last-place Darius and Cameron</i>

00:35.871 --> 00:37.670
<i>couldn't complete their comeback...</i>

00:37.671 --> 00:39.830
I'm looking for the vendor.
Her name is Adriana.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.700
<i>.. and their race came to an end.</i>

00:41.701 --> 00:43.110
You have been eliminated
from the race.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.710
OK.
-Alright.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.150
<i>Nine teams remain.
Who will be eliminated next?</i>

00:48.151 --> 00:50.830
Just a couple of dudes being bros.

00:50.831 --> 00:52.910
Just a couple of bros being jocks.

Brodie and Kurt,
you are team number one!

01:47.949 --> 01:49.508
(BOTH CHEER)

01:49.509 --> 01:50.788
Let's go!
-Whoo!

01:50.789 --> 01:52.308
I think we're definitely
finding a rhythm

01:52.309 --> 01:54.268
and we're hoping to continue that
because we really want to

01:54.269 --> 01:55.348
stay ahead of the pack.

01:55.349 --> 01:58.428
There's been some teams that
we haven't seen since leg one.

01:58.429 --> 02:00.148
Hi, Phil!

02:00.149 --> 02:02.708
You're still here.
You've completed three legs.

02:02.709 --> 02:04.868
I have to say,
my dad carried me, literally,

02:04.869 --> 02:05.988
through this leg of the race.

02:05.989 --> 02:07.548
SCOTT: We're further back
in the pack

02:07.549 --> 02:09.988
but we have great expectations
for today.

02:09.989 --> 02:12.028
And I'm hoping we see
Brodie and Kurt,

02:12.029 --> 02:14.308
because some other contestants
kind of hinted

02:14.309 --> 02:16.308
that maybe he had, like,
a crush or something,

02:16.309 --> 02:18.868
and so I was like, "Oh. OK."

02:18.869 --> 02:20.628
Blair's pretty cute.
That's all I'm going to say.

02:20.629 --> 02:23.308
Dude, Blair.
Dude, got a crush on Blair.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.348
There's a little showmance brewing.

02:25.349 --> 02:32.098
Blair and Brodie are about to be
the new couple of The Amazing Race.

02:32.099 --> 02:33.188
Whoo!

02:33.189 --> 02:35.388
"Fly over the jet stream
on your way to Geneva..."

02:35.389 --> 02:36.428
Switzerland?!

02:36.429 --> 02:40.428
<i>Brodie and Kurt will be the first
to jet their way from South America</i>

02:40.429 --> 02:42.818
to Europe's
most international city -

02:42.819 --> 02:44.628
<i>Geneva, Switzerland.</i>

02:44.629 --> 02:46.698
<i>Located on the banks of Lake Geneva,</i>

02:46.699 --> 02:51.908
<i>this 460ft-high jet stream
is almost impossible to miss</i>

02:51.909 --> 02:54.228
and where teams will find
their next clue.

02:54.229 --> 02:55.668
Vamos al aeropuerto.

02:55.669 --> 02:57.468
Oh, yes! Let's go.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.068
We're going to Switzerland!

02:59.069 --> 03:00.628
(BOTH WHOOP)

03:00.629 --> 03:02.068
Switzerland!

03:02.069 --> 03:04.468
It's going to be snowy, I hope!

03:04.469 --> 03:06.708
Ooh, cab! Cab, cab, cab, cab!

03:06.709 --> 03:08.108
I feel extremely confident.

03:08.109 --> 03:11.428
Three legs in
and we've finished in the top two.

03:11.429 --> 03:12.988
KOREY: The reason I think
we're doing so well

03:12.989 --> 03:15.028
is we've been best friends
for eight years.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.628
You've got to have
good communication

03:16.629 --> 03:19.268
between you and your partner,
and we've got that.

03:19.269 --> 03:21.468
What do they speak in Switzerland?

03:21.469 --> 03:22.709
Swiss?

03:24.269 --> 03:26.188
Urgh... I don't know.

03:26.189 --> 03:27.708
We're going to Switzerland!
-Ahh!

03:27.709 --> 03:30.268
Hold on, hold on."You must take
the following flight to Geneva."

03:30.269 --> 03:32.068
Oh, great. OK, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

03:32.069 --> 03:33.708
Wow! We're all on the same flight.

03:33.709 --> 03:35.068
Switzerland!

03:35.069 --> 03:36.508
I taught hip-hop classes
in Switzerland.

03:36.509 --> 03:38.228
We know it is gonna be cold
in Switzerland.

03:38.229 --> 03:39.708
It's freezing in the winter
in Switzerland.

03:39.709 --> 03:41.548
We are so ready to leave the heat.

03:41.549 --> 03:44.348
I'd like to have one good hair day
on this journey.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.308
I hope it snows.
It could snow.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.828
Oooh!
-Cole...

03:47.829 --> 03:49.348
From Alabama, we never see snow.

03:49.349 --> 03:53.468
So, Geneva, that's where...
there's good chocolate, right?

03:53.469 --> 03:55.109
Swiss chocolate?
-Is there?

03:57.669 --> 04:00.228
We need the best seats
at the front of the plane.

04:00.229 --> 04:03.308
Hola, amigos. We're all on
the same flight to Switzerland.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.548
All nine teams back together!

04:05.549 --> 04:06.549
Let's go.

04:07.629 --> 04:10.068
Oh, my God! Blodie!
-Oh, Blodie!

04:10.069 --> 04:12.228
Let's not all get too excited now.

04:12.229 --> 04:15.228
If we can get Brodie and Blair
to meet...

04:15.229 --> 04:17.668
.. aww, he'd be so happy.

04:17.668 --> 04:19.788
He's got such a little crush.

04:19.789 --> 04:22.017
Tyler wants to be
the flower girl at the wedding.

04:22.019 --> 04:23.188
Oh, my God!

04:23.189 --> 04:24.948
I wonder if Scott will walk me down.

04:24.949 --> 04:27.068

(CONTESTANTS CHATTER)

04:31.069 --> 04:32.109
Oh, hello.

04:33.149 --> 04:34.309
Oh, wow.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.898
It's a reunion.
-It's so good to see you.

04:37.899 --> 04:39.988
Thanks. You too.
-Hey, Scott. -Good to see you again.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.018
Absolutely. Good too see you.
-Haven't seen you in a while!

04:42.019 --> 04:44.428
You guys got one? -God.

04:47.509 --> 04:50.348
Yes.
(WHOOPING)

04:50.349 --> 04:51.508
Hey!

04:51.509 --> 04:54.108
Ah. Great to see you all again.

04:54.109 --> 04:56.388
Oh, photo!
Do you want me to take it?

04:56.389 --> 04:57.748
I don't know where Blair went.

04:57.749 --> 05:00.018
It's always dangerous.
-Blair... Oh, uh...

05:00.019 --> 05:01.898
It's just Blair and Brodie talking.

05:01.899 --> 05:03.828
He's trying to work his magic now.

05:03.829 --> 05:04.948
Oh, wait. One more.

05:04.949 --> 05:06.748
Oh, my gosh!
-Smile!

05:06.749 --> 05:08.148
I am smiling!

05:08.149 --> 05:09.948
This is my smile!

05:09.949 --> 05:11.578
I got to talk to Blair, finally.

05:11.579 --> 05:14.229
I enjoy every racer's company,
Blair included.

05:17.579 --> 05:19.189
What is going on?

05:20.899 --> 05:22.018
Hi, guys!

05:22.019 --> 05:25.148
It's craziness in the airport right
now. We met up with a bunch of fans.

05:25.149 --> 05:27.308
(CROWD CHEERS)

05:27.309 --> 05:28.988
Look at these girls freaking out.

05:28.989 --> 05:30.548
(SQUEALING)

05:30.549 --> 05:33.469
It's massive chaos here.
Massive chaos.

05:37.949 --> 05:40.148
We're headed to Switzerland!

05:40.149 --> 05:41.428
We're in the group again.

05:41.429 --> 05:44.188
We're all together for
the first time since leg one,

05:44.189 --> 05:45.468
so it's game time.

05:45.469 --> 05:47.068
It's kind of back to
survival of the fittest.

05:47.069 --> 05:48.908
Adios, Colombia!

05:48.909 --> 05:50.508
What country is Switzerland in?

05:50.509 --> 05:52.389
What country is Switzerland in?
-It is a country.

05:54.109 --> 05:55.509
Oh, yeah, it is.

05:56.709 --> 05:59.789
PHIL: <i>All teams are now flying
to Geneva, Switzerland.</i>

06:13.229 --> 06:14.828
That looks like the lake to me
over there.

06:14.829 --> 06:16.428
Yeah. Just follow the water.

06:16.429 --> 06:17.948
There it is, babe.
There's the fountain.

06:17.949 --> 06:19.508
We've got to go to
the other side of the river.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.468
That's Zach and Rachel.
-Come on, baby.

06:21.469 --> 06:23.788
Do you see the rest of the group
back there at the stop light?

06:23.789 --> 06:25.748
We can catch them.
-Green, green, green, green.

06:25.749 --> 06:27.828
Come on.

06:27.829 --> 06:29.428
This way.

06:29.429 --> 06:31.748
I see it.
We need to cross over here.

06:31.749 --> 06:33.708
It's that fountain,
so we're going to go here...

06:33.709 --> 06:34.828
This way.
-.. then go to the right.

06:34.829 --> 06:35.988
Yeah.
There it is.

06:35.989 --> 06:37.028
Come on, Mama.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.788
Water fountain! Oh, it's beautiful.

06:39.789 --> 06:42.028
Jet of water.
-Here it is, babe.

06:42.029 --> 06:44.548
How do you get up there?
-I think we walk out here.

06:44.549 --> 06:46.108
Watch out, guys.
-Careful.

06:46.109 --> 06:48.228
Wow. This is beautiful.
-Seriously.

06:48.229 --> 06:49.989
It's slippery. It's slippery. Walk.

06:51.349 --> 06:53.868
Here we go.
-"Make your way on foot..."

06:53.869 --> 06:57.148
"To Chocolats Rohr Geneve
at rue d'Enfer in Geneva."

06:57.149 --> 06:58.668
OK. Good job.
-Let's go.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.789
Whoo! Here we go.

07:02.469 --> 07:06.028
Keep running? No!"Make your way on
foot to Chocolats Rohr Geneve..."

07:06.029 --> 07:07.348
D'Enfer Street.

07:07.349 --> 07:09.348
To the right?

07:09.349 --> 07:10.868
Do you girls know where to go?

07:10.869 --> 07:11.988
No.

07:11.989 --> 07:13.308
I say we just follow them.

07:13.309 --> 07:15.108
OK. We might as well.

07:15.109 --> 07:18.908
Wait, they're all running, Dad!
If we can keep an eye on them...

07:18.909 --> 07:21.308
Oh, I see it.
Up here at this intersection.

07:21.309 --> 07:23.188
This is it here.
-I think it's left.

07:23.189 --> 07:25.868
It is called Chocolats Rohr.
-This is it.

07:25.869 --> 07:27.148
Is it closed?

07:27.149 --> 07:29.108
Rue d'Enfer.
We're on the wrong street.

07:29.109 --> 07:31.309
Oh. No, there's got to
be a different entrance.

07:32.109 --> 07:34.068
Oh, there it is. I think I see it.

07:34.069 --> 07:36.948
Oh, jeez.
We've got a whole pack behind us.

07:36.949 --> 07:39.349
Oh, there, I see it, you guys.
I see it.

07:40.389 --> 07:41.868
The top one?

07:41.869 --> 07:43.988
"You'll be admitted in the order
you arrive." -We got here first!

07:43.989 --> 07:46.508
We got here first!
Oh! Mwah!

07:46.509 --> 07:47.868
OK. So, they open at 10.

07:47.869 --> 07:50.028
Aw. That makes me so happy.

07:50.029 --> 07:52.308
Doing good, Mama.
-You're doing so good, Cole.

07:52.309 --> 07:54.908
Hey, hey, hey! You're missing it.

07:54.909 --> 07:57.068
Hey!
Mom.

07:57.069 --> 07:58.148
Is it here?

07:58.149 --> 07:59.788
It's a board. Run. It's a board.
-It's a board?

07:59.789 --> 08:01.708
It's a board!
-Where?

08:01.709 --> 08:04.468
Oh, my God. I ran right by that.

08:04.469 --> 08:07.348
There's another. Follow the girls.

08:07.349 --> 08:10.668
Did you find it?
-Yeah. It's right around the corner.

08:10.669 --> 08:12.308
It's down here. It's right here.

08:12.309 --> 08:14.668
Thank you, Jesus! -Oh, my gosh.

08:14.669 --> 08:16.588
Ty, grab one.

08:16.589 --> 08:18.468
Five. Shoot. Man.

08:18.469 --> 08:20.628
Seventh?
Yeah, it's fine.

08:20.629 --> 08:21.908
Tomorrow at 10.

08:21.909 --> 08:23.628
Looks like we're spending the night.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.268
(LAUGHS)

08:25.269 --> 08:27.348
My God.
We'll play catch-up tomorrow.

08:27.349 --> 08:29.628
Daddy, come on!
-You're doing good, guys.

08:29.629 --> 08:31.548
OK. Daddy, we're number nine.

08:31.549 --> 08:33.467
Oh! We're last.
-Well, at least we're here.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.669
OK, well, let's go
and find a place to sleep.

08:37.389 --> 08:38.467
Well, this is cute.

08:38.469 --> 08:42.298
Oh, my goodness gracious!

08:42.299 --> 08:44.468
Cuddle puddle!
-Cuddle puddle right here!

08:44.469 --> 08:47.298
So, we're in some basement, cave,

08:47.299 --> 08:49.748
Knights of the Round Table
sort of thing.

08:49.749 --> 08:52.388
Tyler, you're not snuggling with us?

08:52.389 --> 08:54.389
Who knows what'll happen
in the night?

08:56.709 --> 08:58.909
So... here we are.

09:09.229 --> 09:13.418
'Blair' plus 'Brodie'
equals 'Blodie'.

09:13.419 --> 09:14.788
Blodie. Get it trending.

09:14.789 --> 09:16.268
There was a little cuddling
going on.

09:16.269 --> 09:20.418
Yeah, I think it was the moment
when two sleeping bags became one.

09:20.419 --> 09:22.748
There's not non-interest.

09:22.749 --> 09:24.348
I think he's a great guy.

09:24.349 --> 09:27.148
It was nice to finally, you know,
sit down and have a conversation.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.509
And, you know, it was good.
It was a good conversation.

09:32.229 --> 09:34.908
Hashtag #blodie! (LAUGHS)

09:34.909 --> 09:36.906
It's true love.
-It's love.

09:38.936 --> 09:40.375
Bonne chance, everyone.
Bonne chance.

09:40.376 --> 09:41.415
What's that?
-Good luck.

09:41.416 --> 09:42.416
BOTH: Bonjour!

09:42.417 --> 09:44.215
Do you have something for us?
-Yes.

09:44.216 --> 09:45.655
Merci beaucoup.

09:45.656 --> 09:47.415
Is this for us as well?
-Yes.

09:47.416 --> 09:49.615
OK, Detour -
'Work Bench' or 'Bench Work'.

09:49.616 --> 09:53.455
Burnie and Ashley will be the first
team who can assemble one of these

09:53.456 --> 09:57.375
world-famous, precision-built
Swiss Army Knives.

09:57.376 --> 10:02.375
<i>Or work out how many behinds
can fit on this 240-year-old bench</i>

10:02.376 --> 10:03.975
<i>that the people of Geneva claim</i>

10:03.976 --> 10:06.535
<i>is the longest wooden bench
in the world.</i>

10:06.536 --> 10:11.055
<i>This just might be the most famous
product produced in Switzerland.</i>

10:11.056 --> 10:14.975
Teams must make the best-selling
model - the Spartan,

10:14.976 --> 10:18.815
<i>assembling 27 pieces by hand
in an exact order.</i>

10:18.816 --> 10:23.295
This famous bench has been offering
a comfortable seat to locals

10:23.296 --> 10:25.976
since 1767.

10:26.976 --> 10:29.296
And the question
teams have to answer is...

10:33.816 --> 10:37.495
.. how many people
can sit on this bench at once?

10:37.496 --> 10:40.655
<i>If they can figure out the answer
within the specified range,</i>

10:40.656 --> 10:42.005
<i>they'll receive their next clue.</i>

10:42.006 --> 10:44.335
OK, let's do 'Bench Work'. Let's go.
-'Bench Work'. OK.

10:44.336 --> 10:46.215
I figured counting
would be a lot easier.

10:46.216 --> 10:48.695
We brought a clicker.
We were fully prepared.

10:48.696 --> 10:51.495
Let's go up here.
-Oh, wow. How pretty is that?

10:51.496 --> 10:53.655
BOTH: Oh!

10:53.656 --> 10:55.055
Chocolat!

10:55.056 --> 10:57.126
I think the 'Bench Work'
would be faster.

10:58.776 --> 11:00.295
'Bench Work'.

11:00.296 --> 11:01.655
Oh, clue in the chocolate box.

11:01.656 --> 11:03.975
'Work Bench' sounds awesome.
Let's do a Swiss Army Knife.

11:03.976 --> 11:06.335
There's only three stations,
so we're hoping we get there first.

11:06.336 --> 11:08.695
We chose 'Work Bench' because
it's just building something,

11:08.696 --> 11:10.335
and so far, we've built pretty good.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.575
Yum, yum.
-We're going to do 'Bench Work'.

11:12.576 --> 11:14.335
Alright,
we're going to do 'Bench Work'.

11:14.336 --> 11:16.055
Wow! Can we eat our clue?

11:16.056 --> 11:19.055
"Build a classic Swiss Army Knife"?

11:19.056 --> 11:21.055
Yeah.
-I think that sounds... fun.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.975
We both grew up in the country.

11:22.976 --> 11:24.735
I had a kit when I was younger,

11:24.736 --> 11:27.215
so I knew I knew
how to do it already.

11:27.216 --> 11:28.975
And I have about eight knives
at home.

11:28.976 --> 11:30.975
Yeah!
-That sounds bad, but...

11:30.976 --> 11:33.095
.. it is what it is.
-We're good with that kind of stuff.

11:33.096 --> 11:34.855
Is this the street?

11:34.856 --> 11:36.455
I don't know.

11:36.456 --> 11:38.455
I'm going to ask.
-Yeah.

11:38.456 --> 11:40.135
Alright, we're
going to do 'Work Bench'.

11:40.136 --> 11:42.815
Let's just get there and knock
this out and hopefully, you know,

11:42.816 --> 11:45.255
make up a little bit of time
on the other people.

11:45.256 --> 11:47.015
Good luck, guys.
-See you later.

11:47.016 --> 11:48.295
Bonjour!
-Bonjour.

11:48.296 --> 11:50.135
Merci.
-Merci.

11:50.136 --> 11:51.335
Au revoir.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.415
Can you sit and stand quickly, Dad?
-No.

11:53.416 --> 11:55.015
It seemed like
putting something together

11:55.016 --> 11:56.215
that was relatively technical

11:56.216 --> 11:57.535
would be something that we could do,

11:57.536 --> 11:59.615
but also something that would
separate us from the pack.

11:59.616 --> 12:01.775
What's the name of the place
we're going? -Victorinox.

12:01.776 --> 12:04.336
I think I might have got you
one of their watches. -Yeah.

12:06.216 --> 12:08.495
(PANTS) Let's go here.
-Yeah.

12:08.496 --> 12:10.735
Whoa!
-Oh, wow!

12:10.736 --> 12:12.135
It's a big bench.

12:12.136 --> 12:15.495
"Take one copy
of the local paper." OK.

12:15.496 --> 12:17.615
Merci beaucoup. Merci.

12:17.616 --> 12:19.695
Let me get my counter out.
-The gloves are coming off.

12:19.696 --> 12:20.895
The gloves are coming off.

12:20.896 --> 12:22.815
Hey, that makes it sound
really hardcore.

12:22.816 --> 12:24.056
Let's go down here.
-OK.

12:26.176 --> 12:28.135
OK, so, do you think
we can ask these people to get up

12:28.136 --> 12:30.175
if we need to sit in their spot
really quick?

12:30.176 --> 12:31.735
Pardonnez-moi, messieurs.

12:31.736 --> 12:34.215
Yeah, so we're going to be
sliding down the bench.

12:34.216 --> 12:36.015
Is there any way that
we could ask you to move?

12:36.016 --> 12:37.975
It's the world's biggest bench
and we're gonna have to go

12:37.976 --> 12:39.535
the whole way down the thing
with newspaper.

12:39.536 --> 12:42.775
Also a very popular bench, because
there was people all along the way

12:42.776 --> 12:45.135
and we had to explain to them,
"We're coming through..."

12:45.136 --> 12:46.295
We'll try to figure it out.

12:46.296 --> 12:48.815
So, let's just go hand to hand.
(LAUGHS)

12:48.816 --> 12:49.816
(LAUGHS)

12:49.817 --> 12:52.215
One of us has to be on the
bench at all times, though. -Yeah.

12:52.216 --> 12:53.735
Make sure we touch the...

12:53.736 --> 12:54.856
Papers.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.375
Messieurs?

12:57.376 --> 12:59.455
Let's just say there's two dudes
who are playing a chess game

12:59.456 --> 13:01.455
who don't like us very much at all.

13:01.456 --> 13:03.095
They thought we were lunatics.

13:03.096 --> 13:05.415
I don't think it's the word
they used, but that's a word.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.255
Merci beaucoup.
-Merci beaucoup.

13:07.256 --> 13:08.535
(LAUGHS)

13:08.536 --> 13:10.495
This might be it.

13:10.496 --> 13:12.655
We're in Switzerland!

13:12.656 --> 13:13.816
Yeah!

13:16.856 --> 13:18.135
Here, do you think?

13:18.136 --> 13:20.495
Here we go.
-OK. Hello.

13:20.496 --> 13:22.575
You are doing here
the world-famous Spartan.

13:22.576 --> 13:23.576
Oh, wow.

13:23.577 --> 13:26.135
I mean, we are in Switzerland and
we're building a Swiss Army Knife.

13:26.136 --> 13:27.375
How cool is that?
-Yeah.

13:27.376 --> 13:31.575
You will do the whole knife
here in this table.

13:31.576 --> 13:33.056
It should be in here.

13:35.216 --> 13:36.615
This is crazy!

13:36.616 --> 13:38.295
It's a lot more detailed
than we thought.

13:38.296 --> 13:39.415
There's a lot of details here.

13:39.416 --> 13:41.255
The thing about
the Swiss Army Knives is that

13:41.256 --> 13:42.775
they are like perfection.

13:42.776 --> 13:46.375
Everything works perfectly,
the machinery all fits together.

13:46.376 --> 13:48.255
So, this one is next.
-This is awesome.

13:48.256 --> 13:49.735
Do you know which one that goes in?

13:49.736 --> 13:52.616
No. Yeah, let's leave it for now.
-OK.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.855
Fine details.
-Tyler, the three are the same.

13:56.856 --> 13:58.775
Follow this instructions, though.

13:58.776 --> 13:59.776
We were really focused.

13:59.777 --> 14:02.175
The little details,
we will pay attention to

14:02.176 --> 14:03.176
and we will just get it done.

14:03.177 --> 14:06.415
So, three of them were the same size
and only one is small.

14:06.416 --> 14:07.856
The other three are the same.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.255
Cole.

14:10.256 --> 14:12.776
Do you know how to get to
promenade de la Treille?

14:13.896 --> 14:14.896
Up?
Up this way?

14:14.897 --> 14:16.136
Is this the street?

14:21.496 --> 14:22.655
I don't know. Let's ask them.

14:22.656 --> 14:24.695
Sheri, what are you guys doing?

14:24.696 --> 14:26.415
We're doing 'Bench Work'.
-The bench.

14:26.416 --> 14:27.615
We were trying to find the other

14:27.616 --> 14:29.335
but we might have to switch
to 'Bench Work'.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.175
We're doing the other one
and we think it's this way.

14:31.176 --> 14:33.255
What do you want to do?
-You want to switch?

14:33.256 --> 14:34.295
OK.

14:34.296 --> 14:37.175
Victorinox.
-You ready?

14:37.176 --> 14:38.176
Yup.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.615
Daddy, we're the third team!
We got this.

14:40.616 --> 14:43.015
We were so surprised more people
hadn't picked that one.

14:43.016 --> 14:46.296
Thank you so much, by the way.
This is so fun.

14:48.056 --> 14:50.455
OK. Is this the right...
is this the right road?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.655
Should we go this way or this way?
-This looks more direct.

14:52.656 --> 14:53.656
Are you sure?

14:53.657 --> 14:55.296
Let's just see
what this street's called.

14:56.576 --> 14:58.095
Good job.
We've caught up with the first team.

14:58.096 --> 14:59.375
Can we have a newspaper?

14:59.376 --> 15:01.695
Monsieur, por fa..."Por favor"!

15:01.696 --> 15:02.895
Thank you.

15:02.896 --> 15:06.215
This is the ramp to the trail.
-It's up here.

15:06.216 --> 15:08.135
Thank you.
-So we're at the end.

15:08.136 --> 15:09.895
Remember your numbers, OK?
Just the numbers.

15:09.896 --> 15:12.535
That's all we've got to worry about.
73. Madame?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.975
Pardonnez-moi, aussi... we...

15:14.976 --> 15:16.455
OK, go ahead.
-Merci beaucoup.

15:16.456 --> 15:17.975
Merci beaucoup.

15:17.976 --> 15:19.455
Have you been reading the paper?
(LAUGHS)

15:19.456 --> 15:21.295
Let's hurry it up.
-Yeah, let's hurry it up.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.575
91. 94. 98. 96.
(GIGGLES)

15:23.576 --> 15:25.016
Make sure your papers
are square too.

15:25.976 --> 15:28.815
17.
-Excusez-moi.

15:28.816 --> 15:30.256
Stop. Move over.

15:31.256 --> 15:32.656
Sit on his lap. Sit on his lap!

15:33.816 --> 15:35.456
Merci, merci.

15:37.256 --> 15:39.575
Hey, do you guys have anything?
-We don't know.

15:39.576 --> 15:42.375
This is messed up with this thing.
-Watch your strap.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.575
OK, you have snot
dripping down your nose.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.375
Promenade de la Treille?

15:46.376 --> 15:48.415
I think once we go down this way,
Mom, we'll be able to find it.

15:48.416 --> 15:49.655
Yeah, I think.

15:49.656 --> 15:52.695
Let's just see where this
leads us, I guess.

15:52.696 --> 15:55.695
Promenade de la Treille? Ooh.

15:55.696 --> 15:57.655
These look like they're going in
different directions.

15:57.656 --> 16:01.135
I don't even see
the 'rue de Martre' on this map.

16:01.136 --> 16:02.495
Do any of you guys speak English?

16:02.496 --> 16:04.975
Shall we stop for a second?
-Yeah.

16:04.976 --> 16:07.735
Do you speak English? No English?

16:07.736 --> 16:08.736
I don't see anything.

16:08.737 --> 16:10.935
We don't even know
if we're in the right place.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.255
What do you want to do?

16:12.256 --> 16:14.175
I really don't know
where else we can run.

16:14.176 --> 16:15.575
Dang!

16:15.576 --> 16:17.775
Where is it?
-I'm freaking out.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.615
I have not seen marked newsstands.

16:19.616 --> 16:21.295
Man. This sucks.

16:21.296 --> 16:22.936
What the heck?!

16:26.608 --> 16:28.367
If we just go down this way
along the side of the park.

16:28.368 --> 16:30.087
Look for a marked newspaper stand.

16:31.151 --> 16:34.430
It should be... right up there.

16:34.431 --> 16:35.831
Promenade de la Treille?

16:37.031 --> 16:39.310
That part?
-Oh, oh, oh! That's it!

16:39.311 --> 16:41.110
That's it right over there!
-And there are the girls.

16:41.111 --> 16:43.150
Oh, my God, I see people doing it.

16:43.151 --> 16:44.471
13.

16:46.483 --> 16:47.483
14.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.602
We want to go fast
but we want to get right too.

16:49.603 --> 16:51.002
Yeah.
-But keeping count's hard.

16:51.003 --> 16:52.682
Thank God for this counter.

16:52.683 --> 16:54.282
OK, we're almost there, babe.

16:54.283 --> 16:55.522
OK, this is it.

16:55.523 --> 16:57.802
217.

16:57.803 --> 16:59.562
OK, so we need...
-217.

16:59.563 --> 17:00.962
217.
-OK, let's go tell the guy.

17:00.963 --> 17:02.762
"Write your answer
on the newspaper."

17:02.763 --> 17:03.842
On the newspaper.

17:03.843 --> 17:06.122
OK. (PANTS)

17:06.123 --> 17:07.923
217.

17:08.923 --> 17:10.561
No?
-No?

17:10.563 --> 17:13.682
It was very precise
how you had to hold your paper.

17:13.683 --> 17:16.122
Because it was such a long bench,
if you had any variance,

17:16.123 --> 17:18.442
it would just get so exaggerated
by the end of the run.

17:18.443 --> 17:20.162
So we can't guess again.
We have to go.

17:20.163 --> 17:21.592
We have to do it all over again.

17:21.593 --> 17:22.762
Do it all over again.
-OK.

17:22.762 --> 17:23.963
Excusez-moi?

17:24.963 --> 17:27.442
Thank you so much. Merci, merci.

17:27.443 --> 17:29.162
Alright, guys,
we didn't get the right number,

17:29.163 --> 17:30.163
so can we join with you guys?

17:30.164 --> 17:32.242
What was your number?
-Where were you at? -217.

17:32.243 --> 17:34.322
We're 56.
-We're 52 here.

17:34.323 --> 17:36.002
52.
-So somebody's wrong already.

17:36.003 --> 17:39.352
Let's just see. If one of us
gets it right, then we're good.

17:39.353 --> 17:41.442
Maybe we should start again.
-Yeah.

17:41.443 --> 17:43.072
I don't know what
we did wrong, though.

17:43.073 --> 17:45.072
There's a range
and we weren't even in the range.

17:45.073 --> 17:47.122
Everyone else is coming.

17:47.123 --> 17:48.762
Almost there, Mama.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.882
52. 3. 4. 56.

17:50.883 --> 17:52.682
I think we're getting
too close, Jos.

17:52.683 --> 17:54.592
People don't read newspapers
that close.

17:54.593 --> 17:56.562
We have to start
at the very beginning.

17:56.563 --> 17:59.002
OK. Can we do this one?

17:59.003 --> 18:00.442
Or this one?

18:00.443 --> 18:02.122
It's got to be this one.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.643
I think the total does matter.

18:05.123 --> 18:06.922
It shouldn't be this hard.

18:06.923 --> 18:09.042
See, we're getting
these weird problems.

18:09.043 --> 18:13.962
Just something is off.
We shouldn't have to force anything.

18:13.963 --> 18:16.522
It's kind of like Legos
but way harder.

18:16.523 --> 18:18.562
Oh, man.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.922
Why do we always pick
the hard Detours?

18:20.923 --> 18:23.522
Pfff.
Um, what do you want to do?

18:23.523 --> 18:26.002
I want to figure out
why it's not working.

18:26.003 --> 18:28.762
OK. That needs to press.

18:28.763 --> 18:31.202
There's a million little pieces.

18:31.203 --> 18:32.922
We're just trying to
line them up just right.

18:32.923 --> 18:34.242
Good?

18:34.243 --> 18:36.002
Now this piece - 8.

18:36.003 --> 18:37.562
It was pretty much
just a big puzzle.

18:37.563 --> 18:39.482
I mean, everything had a piece

18:39.483 --> 18:42.642
and nothing would work unless
every piece was in place.

18:42.643 --> 18:45.242
If you tried to fit it in,
tried to make it work,

18:45.243 --> 18:47.202
you were going to have to start
all over, and we were like,

18:47.203 --> 18:49.802
"Smart and steady -
we're going to finish this first."

18:49.803 --> 18:51.922
Oh, my God. Ty.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.682
I'm here.

18:53.683 --> 18:57.562
Remember - lined up evenly
and perfectly. No space.

18:57.563 --> 18:59.402
I think we're doing the right roles
for each other.

18:59.403 --> 19:02.642
He's staying calm doing this,
I'm trying to help him.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.802
I'm really glad that my dad
was here for that challenge,

19:04.803 --> 19:07.522
because his surgeon hands
just went to work

19:07.523 --> 19:10.482
and I was his... nurse assistant!

19:10.483 --> 19:11.522
You got it, Daddy.

19:11.523 --> 19:14.042
SCOTT: She did a great job
just being my partner.

19:14.043 --> 19:16.722
And vice versa, I hope.
-Yes.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.322
This is so cool.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.922
24, 26, 27, 28...

19:21.923 --> 19:23.562
Going to squeeze in here. Sorry.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.003
Come on, we got to keep it together.

19:26.203 --> 19:27.203
Ow.

19:27.204 --> 19:28.802
Pay attention.

19:28.803 --> 19:30.402
I can't pay attention,

19:30.403 --> 19:32.482
'cause you're bickering with me
over some stupid...

19:32.483 --> 19:35.592
I'm asking you not to hit my hand
every time. 160.

19:35.593 --> 19:37.072
146.

19:37.073 --> 19:38.073
Where are you guys at?

19:38.074 --> 19:39.482
146.

19:39.483 --> 19:41.562
I think we're all...
we're both wrong.

19:41.563 --> 19:42.963
Where are you guys at?

19:44.963 --> 19:46.593
What did you get?

19:48.683 --> 19:50.563
Oh, my hand's cramping
from clicking this thing.

19:51.563 --> 19:53.352
OK. Come on, babe.

19:53.353 --> 19:54.802
Merci.
-134.

19:54.803 --> 19:56.243
Got it.

19:57.723 --> 20:00.402
Is that 94, Cole?
-Maybe.

20:00.403 --> 20:02.402
Are they wrong or are we wrong?
-I don't know.

20:02.403 --> 20:04.563
It's too distracting
to think and talk.

20:06.283 --> 20:08.003
84.

20:10.043 --> 20:13.242
Cut those off.
-And then bang it shut.

20:13.243 --> 20:14.483
It's really cool.

20:17.283 --> 20:20.042
That seems good. Oh, yeah.

20:20.043 --> 20:21.642
Now washers. Rim up.

20:21.643 --> 20:23.763
It's not the small ones -
they're a different shape.

20:29.403 --> 20:30.723
Too wobbly?
-Yeah.

20:32.283 --> 20:35.122
No blade?
-Yeah. The small blade is not there.

20:35.123 --> 20:36.523
Oh, that's why everything is weird.

20:39.593 --> 20:41.592
It just needs to fit.

20:41.593 --> 20:43.962
Guys, did your washers
make a big difference?

20:43.963 --> 20:45.042
Yes, they do.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.162
Now we have to cut off the things
and then hammer it.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.643
Oh, yes. Cut it.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.691
203. Do you think it's 203?

20:54.692 --> 20:56.241
What are they doing?

20:56.242 --> 20:58.292
Write it on our newspaper.
-Come on, let's go.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.531
We got to do this fast.

21:04.532 --> 21:06.771
We have to be right. Please.

21:06.772 --> 21:09.001
203.
Uh-uh.

21:09.002 --> 21:10.851
Not even close, obviously?

21:10.852 --> 21:12.481
Let me see the clue.
Let me see the clue.

21:12.482 --> 21:14.292
Bonjour.

21:15.242 --> 21:16.452
No?

21:18.532 --> 21:20.131
Oui.
-Hey, we got it.

21:20.132 --> 21:22.051
We got it?

21:22.052 --> 21:25.771
"Make your way to the Broken Chair
and search for your next clue."

21:25.772 --> 21:27.241
That's it. Let's go.
-OK, let's go.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.932
What did you guys get?
-We got 201.

21:30.132 --> 21:31.611
You don't think so?

21:31.612 --> 21:32.851
Did you guys get it?

21:32.852 --> 21:35.001
What did you guys say?
-203.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.851
Lower. 190.

21:36.852 --> 21:38.171
We told them the answer because,

21:38.172 --> 21:40.451
honestly, every team here,
we're really friends with

21:40.452 --> 21:43.721
and we haven't really been in that,
like, do-or-die situation,

21:43.722 --> 21:45.811
so I think we are just giving,
like, little clues

21:45.812 --> 21:47.771
just to kind of keep us all
in the front.

21:47.772 --> 21:48.811
Hey, guys.

21:48.812 --> 21:50.611
190, 190.
-OK, thank you.

21:50.612 --> 21:52.251
Monsieur, voila!

21:52.252 --> 21:53.571
Oui!
(LAUGHS)

21:53.572 --> 21:54.931
Are the dancers going again?

21:54.932 --> 21:57.171
Hey, Burnie and Ashley, let's work
to figure out where this is.

21:57.172 --> 21:58.771
It's all about
just staying in front.

21:58.772 --> 22:01.691
Sorry, excuse us again.
One more time. Pardon.

22:01.692 --> 22:03.691
They told us the answer,
but, unfortunately,

22:03.692 --> 22:05.931
we had to go back
and do the whole thing again.

22:05.932 --> 22:08.851
Get over. You're too close to me.
-18. I can't - their chessboard.

22:08.852 --> 22:10.932
Well, sit on it.
-18. No.

22:12.692 --> 22:14.131
Careful. Careful!

22:14.132 --> 22:15.732
And hammer those down.

22:16.732 --> 22:17.972
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, you're fine.

22:18.972 --> 22:21.131
Ooh! Yowser!
-Oh, my God.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.251
We don't have time for that.

22:23.252 --> 22:25.611
That's the blade we forgot.
-Are you sure?

22:25.612 --> 22:26.971
Yep.
-OK.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.732
And then you're going to
pound it after that.

22:29.812 --> 22:31.931
Yes! That's the best part.
-Good job.

22:31.932 --> 22:34.491
This is the last thing that goes on.

22:34.492 --> 22:35.851
I think I got it.
OK.

22:35.852 --> 22:37.931
Korey's on a mission!
-It's close.

22:37.932 --> 22:39.571
(CLICKING)

22:39.572 --> 22:41.531
That looks good to me!
-All those clicks!

22:41.532 --> 22:42.691
That's a good knife!

22:42.692 --> 22:44.251
Well done.
-Yeah!

22:44.252 --> 22:46.411
Do we get to keep our knife?
Thank you!

22:46.412 --> 22:48.651
Broken Chair.
We need a local.

22:48.652 --> 22:51.931
Hi! Bonjour!
Do you know the Broken Chair?

22:51.932 --> 22:54.571
It's over there. -Do you think
we should walk or take a bus?

22:54.572 --> 22:55.692
I think you should run.

22:57.172 --> 22:58.731
Thank you so much.

22:58.732 --> 23:01.131
59, 60, 61.

23:01.132 --> 23:02.291
63.

23:02.292 --> 23:04.051
OK.
Let's write it down.

23:04.052 --> 23:06.771
In the corner of the paper, right?
Is that where we write it?

23:06.772 --> 23:07.812
93.

23:09.452 --> 23:11.851
94.
194.

23:11.852 --> 23:13.931
No.
No?

23:13.932 --> 23:15.811
I don't get it!
-Me neither.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.851
Maybe we should start
at the other end.

23:17.852 --> 23:19.931
I think he said 190.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.051
He was mouthing it to us. Did you...

23:22.052 --> 23:23.411
Were you looking?
-Go ahead. Go.

23:23.412 --> 23:26.211
Don't be too close to me.
We were too high before.

23:26.212 --> 23:27.691
Oui.

23:27.692 --> 23:29.211
(BOTH CHEER)

23:29.212 --> 23:30.571
Oh, my God. They're right.

23:30.572 --> 23:31.731
14.

23:31.732 --> 23:33.931
It's the last time.
It's the last time.

23:33.932 --> 23:35.491
BURNIE: What did you guys get
for your number?

23:35.492 --> 23:36.771
SHERI: 194.
-Nice.

23:36.772 --> 23:38.491
What did y'all get?
-190.

23:38.492 --> 23:40.851
Get on the bus. Let's go.
-Let's make this bus move.

23:40.852 --> 23:41.931
Let's go, let's go.

23:41.932 --> 23:43.411
I'm hoping this was faster.
I'm hoping.

23:43.412 --> 23:44.571
79.
80.

23:44.572 --> 23:46.212
81.
82.

23:47.532 --> 23:48.651
190.
-190. Let's go.

23:48.652 --> 23:50.651
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
-Sorry, sorry.

23:50.652 --> 23:52.211
Bonjour.

23:52.212 --> 23:54.491
Is this right?
-Yes.

23:54.492 --> 23:57.211
Everyone else is right on our tail,
so if they're right, we're screwed.

23:57.212 --> 23:58.372
OK.

23:59.852 --> 24:01.532
Thank God.
-OK, let's go. Come on.

24:02.532 --> 24:04.771
59... They got it.

24:04.772 --> 24:06.451
Good luck, ladies.
-Keep it up, you guys.

24:06.452 --> 24:10.011
This is not fun. -I wish we could
have done the knife one.

24:10.012 --> 24:11.412
Want to check it?

24:13.452 --> 24:15.011
Congratulations.

24:15.012 --> 24:16.531
Ah, thank you.
-Thank you!

24:16.532 --> 24:18.531
Good luck, Blair and dad.

24:18.532 --> 24:20.731
Running in the cold again!

24:20.732 --> 24:23.251
Whoo! -Alright, babe, so let's run
to the train station.

24:23.252 --> 24:26.411
This is it. 15.
-Alright, here we go.

24:26.412 --> 24:28.292
Stay to the front of the bus.

24:29.892 --> 24:33.332
ERIN: Here's the station.
-10, five, seven...

24:34.452 --> 24:35.452
15, yes.

24:38.412 --> 24:39.691
OK, thank you.

24:39.692 --> 24:41.371
ZACH: We are going to
the Broken Chair.

24:41.372 --> 24:42.971
We're on the train to the last stop.

24:42.972 --> 24:45.371
That's where we should find
the monument,

24:45.372 --> 24:47.331
or some kind of statue
for a broken chair.

24:47.332 --> 24:51.172
Couldn't we just ask somebody?
-(LAUGHS) Five...

24:52.412 --> 24:54.971
And we made a Swiss Army Knife!

24:54.972 --> 24:58.251
Congratulations. Well done.
-Thank you so much!

24:58.252 --> 25:00.851
Alright, Daddy, we're headed to
the Broken Chair.

25:00.852 --> 25:02.971
Well, we get a tram
right on this side.

25:02.972 --> 25:06.491
This is it. This side. Six minutes.

25:06.492 --> 25:09.131
Oh, my gosh.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.931
Oh, wait. There are the girls.

25:10.932 --> 25:13.251
Joslyn!
-There's Blair and her dad.

25:13.252 --> 25:15.251
Oh, my gosh. -Hey, guys.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.571
This one.
-This one.

25:16.572 --> 25:18.891
Here we go. 15.

25:18.892 --> 25:22.171
Yeah, this is us. -We've got to
make up some ground.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.731
It's a little faster than a walk.

25:23.732 --> 25:26.371
(BOTH COUNT)

25:26.372 --> 25:28.371
You want to say 12 or 13?

25:28.372 --> 25:30.371
Just do 212.

25:30.372 --> 25:33.291
I'm getting my coat,
putting it on,

25:33.292 --> 25:36.171
because I have faith
that this one is right.

25:36.172 --> 25:38.012
I know it has to be.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.931
What?
No?

25:41.932 --> 25:44.331
How is that not right?
-How is that not right?

25:44.332 --> 25:46.532
Oh, my God. We are screwed
right now.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.917
BRITTANY: Never been more annoyed
in my life. -Get the marker ready.

25:54.918 --> 25:57.397
That's the last seat.
-191.

25:57.398 --> 26:00.278
We'll just walk to the Pit Stop
on our own.

26:01.278 --> 26:03.477
I hope you like us right now.

26:03.478 --> 26:06.157
We've been counting.

26:06.158 --> 26:08.517
Yes!
-Oh, my God.

26:08.518 --> 26:11.758
Oh. Hold the tears, Jess.
Hold the tears.

26:12.998 --> 26:15.397
I see the flags.
Oh, there's the chair!

26:15.398 --> 26:17.077
The United Nations?
-Yes.

26:17.078 --> 26:19.757
Roadblock.
"Who's having a banner day?"

26:19.758 --> 26:22.557
PHIL: <i>The UN was established in 1945</i>

26:22.558 --> 26:25.637
<i>to help maintain international peace
and security.</i>

26:25.638 --> 26:27.757
<i>Today, it has 193 member states,</i>

26:27.758 --> 26:31.637
<i>who all have their flags </i> represented
here at the United Nations.

26:31.638 --> 26:34.117
<i>Teams must identify 10 flags,</i>

26:34.118 --> 26:36.717
<i>representing 10 countries
who were the founding members.</i>

26:36.718 --> 26:38.877
Let's hope they get it right
the first time,

26:38.878 --> 26:42.117
otherwise they'll be covering
a lot of terrain.

26:42.118 --> 26:43.638
Korey's doing it.

26:44.638 --> 26:46.877
I'm pretty good with flags.

26:46.878 --> 26:49.437
Slow and steady.
-Oh, here's the map.

26:49.438 --> 26:52.677
"There are 10 flags highlighted on
the large flag map."

26:52.678 --> 26:55.837
OK, so these are what I've got to
find. One, two, three...

26:55.838 --> 26:58.797
.. four, five, six...
.. seven, eight, nine, 10.

26:58.798 --> 27:00.277
"Choose the book of flags."

27:00.278 --> 27:02.557
I've got to find
the yellow countries.

27:02.558 --> 27:05.397
"Remove those flags from your book
and hand them to the official."

27:05.398 --> 27:06.798
Oh, my God.

27:08.318 --> 27:09.957
BRODIE: There it is.
-BURNIE: Broken Chair.

27:09.958 --> 27:11.317
Kurt's doing it.
-I'm doing it.

27:11.318 --> 27:12.517
I'll do it.
-OK.

27:12.518 --> 27:14.677
I'm having a banner day.
-Cole's going to do it.

27:14.678 --> 27:19.557
United Nations! Slow and steady,
boys. Work together.

27:19.558 --> 27:21.437
Do you know flags?
-I know flags pretty well.

27:21.438 --> 27:22.917
OK, pick 'em out.

27:22.918 --> 27:26.997
Netherlands, Norway, Costa Rica,
Turkey I believe I know,

27:26.998 --> 27:28.757
Ethiopia...
-Oh, I have no idea.

27:28.758 --> 27:30.357
Wow, these are tough ones.

27:30.358 --> 27:33.477
Cole, you'll do fine, baby.
You'll do fine.

27:33.478 --> 27:35.957
Hey, this is South Africa.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.757
I'm glad Korey's doing this.
-I'm glad Kurt's doing this.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.197
ASHLEY: I'm glad Burnie's
doing this.

27:40.198 --> 27:42.037
SHERI: And I'm glad Cole's doing it,
because he knew...

27:42.038 --> 27:44.597
(BOTH LAUGH)
.. he knows some from soccer.

27:44.598 --> 27:46.637
Norway.
Do you guys have Norway?

27:46.638 --> 27:50.277
A lot of them I knew because I play
a lot of FIFA, the video game.

27:50.278 --> 27:52.037
It's got, like,
the country's flag there.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.277
And I was able to match up
five or six of them.

27:54.278 --> 27:56.917
There must be an easier way to know.

27:56.918 --> 27:58.117
There's, like, a key?

27:58.118 --> 27:59.917
What is Korey up to?

27:59.918 --> 28:02.077
I knew there was a piece
that was missing,

28:02.078 --> 28:04.157
so I was trying to figure out
if there was a key

28:04.158 --> 28:07.038
somewhere on the property that would
tell you which flags were which.

28:08.278 --> 28:09.437
BURNIE: Are there plaques, Korey?

28:09.438 --> 28:11.797
Do they tell you
what nation they are on them?

28:11.798 --> 28:13.157
No, I'm looking.

28:13.158 --> 28:15.637
I think he's looking at the flags.

28:15.638 --> 28:17.557
There's a map here. There's a map.

28:17.558 --> 28:19.357
They figured something out.

28:19.358 --> 28:21.397
Nope, nothing good. It's not a key.
It's not a key.

28:21.398 --> 28:22.877
This is hard.

28:22.878 --> 28:26.077
Roadblock -"Who is having
a banner day?"

28:26.078 --> 28:27.957
Bang.
-I'm having a banner day.

28:27.958 --> 28:30.877
Oh, oh, I have an idea.

28:30.878 --> 28:32.397
Good luck, baby. You got this.

28:32.398 --> 28:33.837
Map the flags on the map

28:33.838 --> 28:35.797
are corresponding with
the flags on the poles.

28:35.798 --> 28:39.397
The flag poles on the map
were in the same order

28:39.398 --> 28:41.837
of the actual flag poles
on the property.

28:41.838 --> 28:44.677
And once you figured that out, you
could just count them on the map.

28:44.678 --> 28:47.037
Six, seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12...

28:47.038 --> 28:49.397
One, two, three, four...

28:49.398 --> 28:53.157
And then run down the rows
and count the same flags

28:53.158 --> 28:55.278
to match the flags
that were in our books.

28:57.638 --> 29:00.597
This is a map of the grounds.

29:00.598 --> 29:02.078
Just keep it between us.

29:04.238 --> 29:06.437
COLE: Me and Korey teamed up
on the Roadblock

29:06.438 --> 29:08.758
because the flags
were really, really difficult.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.477
We split up and said,"You take
the poles on the right,

29:12.478 --> 29:14.157
"I'll take the poles on the left,

29:14.158 --> 29:16.277
"and then we'll compare notes
at the end."

29:16.278 --> 29:17.917
Where's he going?

29:17.918 --> 29:19.357
I think they figured it out.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.717
(COUNTS)

29:21.718 --> 29:23.478
It's right. My key is right.

29:25.078 --> 29:27.877
You can do this, baby.
-OK, sure. I'll do it.

29:27.878 --> 29:31.558
Here... They're coming.
-OK, there it is.

29:33.398 --> 29:34.958
Good luck, baby.

29:35.958 --> 29:38.317
(COUNTS)

29:38.318 --> 29:41.117
Norway, Ethiopia, South Africa.

29:41.118 --> 29:44.797
Burnie, Kurt, and Cole had just
tried to guess some of the flags.

29:44.798 --> 29:47.397
Is this Liberia?
-I don't think that is it, no.

29:47.398 --> 29:49.237
I had already ripped those
out of my book,

29:49.238 --> 29:50.678
just hoping that they were right.

29:52.798 --> 29:54.638
Matt.

29:58.638 --> 30:00.957
Come over here. Let me see yours.
Let me see yours.

30:00.958 --> 30:03.757
It seemed that all the teams
had kind of partnered up,

30:03.758 --> 30:05.797
so I started doing it by myself.

30:05.798 --> 30:07.597
I'm literally just guessing.

30:07.598 --> 30:10.117
Yeah, it's a lot of guessing.

30:10.118 --> 30:11.998
You've got this, Rach.
Take your time.

30:13.718 --> 30:15.317
BURNIE: We were working on
this enormous board

30:15.318 --> 30:16.757
that had a list
of all the countries.

30:16.758 --> 30:18.357
We thought, "There's got to be a map

30:18.358 --> 30:20.237
"that shows us
what all these flags are."

30:20.238 --> 30:21.638
Then I realised...

30:22.638 --> 30:25.198
.. the board that we were working on
was the map!

30:27.118 --> 30:28.877
Kurt, Kurt, come here, come here.

30:28.878 --> 30:31.957
The map... the map
is the row of flags.

30:31.958 --> 30:34.077
Duh.
-Got it.

30:34.078 --> 30:36.997
This order matches the map, and then
I can just run and match it.

30:36.998 --> 30:38.757
Can I try mine?
-Sure.

30:38.758 --> 30:40.157
TYLER: Come on, Korey.

30:40.158 --> 30:41.437
We need Belarus.

30:41.438 --> 30:43.998
One, two, four, five, eight...

30:46.398 --> 30:48.517
ASHLEY: You got this.
You got this, Bu. You got it.

30:48.518 --> 30:51.237
The boys said they were guessing on
three at the beginning.

30:51.238 --> 30:53.519
I didn't check their work on
the ones they said they knew.

30:57.318 --> 30:59.998
Incorrect.
-It's not correct?

31:02.958 --> 31:04.797
Costa Rica. Do you know
which one it is?

31:04.798 --> 31:06.557
No, 'cause I don't know
which ones were wrong.

31:06.558 --> 31:07.837
Matt and I realised

31:07.838 --> 31:09.957
we were going to have to do
the whole puzzle from scratch.

31:09.958 --> 31:11.517
Turkey's second to the end.

31:11.518 --> 31:14.717
I think I've got it, guys.
Judge, please. Judge.

31:14.718 --> 31:16.197
Voila. Thank you.

31:16.198 --> 31:18.517
Burnie's trying to get it.
Burnie's trying to get it.

31:18.518 --> 31:22.157
I'm getting ready to go. I feel it.
I feel it in my blood.

31:22.158 --> 31:23.877
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

31:23.878 --> 31:25.157
Burnie, can you help?
-Burnie, please.

31:25.158 --> 31:27.117
Merci beaucoup. What have you got?
What do you need?

31:27.118 --> 31:28.118
Belarus.

31:28.119 --> 31:30.397
Why don't I see it?

31:30.398 --> 31:32.477
Those are alright,
the ones you showed me. -Yeah.

31:32.478 --> 31:35.077
Good luck, Blair.
"Choose a book of flags..."

31:35.078 --> 31:36.997
Come on, baby.
-Whoo!

31:36.998 --> 31:38.717
Looking good, Burnie!
-I've got it.

31:38.718 --> 31:40.877
I'm going to give it to him.
-Do you have Liberia?

31:40.878 --> 31:43.917
Route Info -"Travel by train..."
(GASPS)".. to Chamonix in France."

31:43.918 --> 31:47.677
Burnie and Ashley will be the first
team to leave Switzerland

31:47.678 --> 31:51.117
<i>for the French Alps
and the town of Chamonix,</i>

31:51.118 --> 31:53.117
<i>the birthplace of winter sports</i>

31:53.118 --> 31:56.117
<i>and home to
the very first Winter Olympics.</i>

31:56.118 --> 31:58.797
<i>They'll find me here
in the centre of town,</i>

31:58.798 --> 32:01.157
where the last team
may be eliminated.

32:01.158 --> 32:02.997
Let's get our bags and go.

32:02.998 --> 32:04.717
ERIN: You got it, Joslyn.

32:04.718 --> 32:05.957
Just give me the same ones.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.198
Do you want to work together?

32:08.398 --> 32:09.678
This is brilliant!

32:12.678 --> 32:15.037
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

32:15.038 --> 32:16.797
Merci, merci, merci.

32:16.798 --> 32:18.317
Costa Rica...

32:18.318 --> 32:21.277
Yes! We're out, we're out.

32:21.278 --> 32:23.397
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

32:23.398 --> 32:25.717
Yay, Cole! Whoo!

32:25.718 --> 32:28.237
Two, three, four, five...
-Girls, do you want to compare?

32:28.238 --> 32:29.917
I have six.
It's this one.

32:29.918 --> 32:31.357
OK, OK.

32:31.358 --> 32:33.797
There's a little leverage if you
want to work with someone else,

32:33.798 --> 32:35.557
but I think we will get to a point

32:35.558 --> 32:37.597
where teams really are going to
have to work on their own.

32:37.598 --> 32:39.358
Where are the models?

32:41.198 --> 32:42.838
I see a clue box.

32:44.158 --> 32:46.037
The models just got here, guys.

32:46.038 --> 32:48.597
Are you guys figuring this out?
We're the last team.

32:48.598 --> 32:49.997
No, we're just, like, guessing.

32:49.998 --> 32:52.385
Oh, where do you get the...
-Right here, in front of you.

32:52.420 --> 32:53.757
Oh, so I don't really have a choice?

32:53.758 --> 32:55.397
Show us the one we don't have.

32:55.398 --> 32:57.237
Can you just brief me?

32:57.238 --> 33:00.117
We're just trying to guess
these flags. We have no idea.

33:00.118 --> 33:02.317
From Costa Rica, Joslyn...

33:02.318 --> 33:05.917
From Costa Rica, we have 12, 13, 14.

33:05.918 --> 33:07.917
Have any of you guys
gotten this one?

33:07.918 --> 33:09.117
Can't find it yet.

33:09.118 --> 33:11.157
If I had gotten to the Roadblock

33:11.158 --> 33:14.117
and everyone was doing their own
thing, I would have said,"Cool."

33:14.118 --> 33:16.437
12, 13, 14...

33:16.438 --> 33:19.477
But when I saw everyone
was in a group,

33:19.478 --> 33:22.837
I felt excluded - like, why are you
girls not wanting to help?

33:22.838 --> 33:24.997
Yeah, it's the star. It's this one.

33:24.998 --> 33:27.037
BLAIR: At that point,
if we were the last teams

33:27.038 --> 33:28.757
and it was going to be a race,

33:28.758 --> 33:30.917
then we needed someone behind us.

33:30.918 --> 33:33.918
I really don't know
what I have to do.

33:35.958 --> 33:39.877
So we are on a train right now
for Chamonix in France.

33:39.878 --> 33:41.517
We're leaving Switzerland.

33:41.518 --> 33:43.557
We're going to be connecting
through Martigny.

33:43.558 --> 33:45.557
As long as we're in front,
we're still winning.

33:45.558 --> 33:46.957
That's the most important thing.

33:46.958 --> 33:50.518
Let's just not be last.
-Let's just not be last.

33:52.438 --> 33:54.477
Which one did you check?
-I... Is it...

33:54.478 --> 33:55.717
We checked that one
and the other one.

33:55.718 --> 33:57.117
I've asked others for help,

33:57.118 --> 33:59.677
but no-one wants to help
the person that's in last.

33:59.678 --> 34:01.277
Come on, Matt, use your head.

34:01.278 --> 34:04.397
Let me try with this.
-Matt, you've got this.

34:04.398 --> 34:06.517
Have you guys found this one?

34:06.518 --> 34:08.998
12, 13, 14, 15...

34:11.918 --> 34:13.958
Congratulations.
-That's correct.

34:16.638 --> 34:18.387
You got it, baby?
-Yeah.

34:18.388 --> 34:19.388
Good job, baby.

34:19.389 --> 34:22.347
Come on.
-I hope Korey's is right.

34:22.348 --> 34:25.437
"Warning - last two to check in may
be eliminated." Come on, let's go.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.717
He'll get it.

34:26.717 --> 34:29.317
Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.347
I'm so sorry, Ty.
-You know you killed it.

34:31.348 --> 34:34.478
OK, we need to get to
that main train station.

34:35.478 --> 34:37.077
(SIGHS)

34:37.078 --> 34:38.867
Just take your time.
-You've got it, girl.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.677
No, everyone's in a team.

34:40.678 --> 34:42.597
It's not that I think no-one
will work with me,

34:42.598 --> 34:44.277
it's that I know
no-one will work with me.

34:44.277 --> 34:46.827
Just sucks, though. Like, I feel
like I help everyone.

34:46.828 --> 34:49.077
Just... I guess no-one wants to
share information

34:49.078 --> 34:50.917
with the person
who comes in last.

34:50.918 --> 34:52.677
Whoo!
Guys, we got it.

34:52.678 --> 34:53.678
Got it.
-We got it.

34:53.679 --> 34:56.597
They just talk to each other,
not me.

34:56.598 --> 34:58.957
Yep, you guys got it. I love you.

34:58.958 --> 35:00.117
Thank you so much.

35:00.118 --> 35:01.997
I really appreciate it.
Hey, you got it, girl.

35:01.998 --> 35:05.387
No-one just wants to help me.
Whatever.

35:05.388 --> 35:07.238
Whoo-hoo! Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

35:08.238 --> 35:11.557
Bye.
-Let's go. Come on, let's go.

35:11.558 --> 35:13.387
Joslyn.
-Joslyn.

35:13.388 --> 35:16.237
Norway. Liberia. Let's see...

35:16.238 --> 35:19.077
Guys, I think we need to go
to the station.

35:19.078 --> 35:21.597
Nine, 10...

35:21.598 --> 35:24.317
BRITTANY: So, to see all those women
up there and to not help Jessica,

35:24.318 --> 35:25.868
I was pretty upset.

35:39.477 --> 35:41.236
JESSICA: Fingers are so cold,

35:41.237 --> 35:44.236
I can, like, barely flip
through these pages.

35:44.237 --> 35:47.476
OK, this has how many red stripes?

35:47.477 --> 35:48.956
One, two...

35:48.957 --> 35:50.276
JOSLYN: Here it comes.

35:50.277 --> 35:52.996
Hopefully, there's chardonnay
and martinis where we're going.

35:52.997 --> 35:55.956
KOREY: So, we're on a train
to Martigny.

35:55.957 --> 35:57.196
All aboard.

35:57.197 --> 36:01.236
We're here with the dancers,
the hosts, the kings,

36:01.237 --> 36:03.026
and Brodie's girlfriend.

36:03.027 --> 36:05.677
(LAUGHS)

36:07.877 --> 36:11.317
Hashtag #Blodie! (LAUGHS)

36:17.507 --> 36:19.276
Thank you.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.477
Let's just go back to
the train station.

36:22.797 --> 36:25.156
BURNIE: So we have, like,
an hour layover, don't we?

36:25.157 --> 36:27.717
Yep, here we go. Martigny.

36:28.717 --> 36:31.236
They said track one.
Number one. Left.

36:31.237 --> 36:33.506
Burnie, make sure.
-Yeah, I'll double-check.

36:33.507 --> 36:34.716
Stay here.

36:34.717 --> 36:38.506
The train for Chamonix?
-It goes to Chamonix.

36:38.507 --> 36:40.636
Let's just ask one more person.

36:40.637 --> 36:43.757
Pardonnez-moi.
Does this train go to Chamonix?

36:45.997 --> 36:47.197
Vallorcine? OK.

36:49.317 --> 36:50.916
One hour in Vallorcine.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.996
So, everyone's doing
two connections.

36:52.997 --> 36:57.067
Oh, my God. This leg is
so much more stressful.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.916
BRITTANY: Trying to be hopeful.

37:01.917 --> 37:04.837
I'm kind of disappointed,
though, with the other teams.

37:07.117 --> 37:08.596
10 minutes to departure.

37:08.597 --> 37:11.476
We're on the train
with Zach and Rachel,

37:11.477 --> 37:15.156
Joslyn and Erin, Tyler and Korey,
and Matt and Dana.

37:15.157 --> 37:17.316
We think we are the last four teams

37:17.317 --> 37:20.236
except for the models
we know are behind us,

37:20.237 --> 37:22.757
and we're not sure if they're
going to make this train or not.

37:26.027 --> 37:27.956
This is going to take,
like, a miracle.

37:27.957 --> 37:29.756
JOSLYN: I see them.
-ERIN: You see them?

37:29.757 --> 37:31.026
I think I saw their bags.

37:31.027 --> 37:33.676
There they are. I saw them.
-Guys, hide.

37:33.677 --> 37:36.026
Hide. No, hide.

37:36.027 --> 37:37.996
Joslyn just saw them.
-Hide.

37:37.997 --> 37:40.836
Another train pulled up.
It could be them.

37:40.837 --> 37:43.116
Can we have everyone down, please?

37:43.117 --> 37:45.506
That's our train,
but it's about to leave?

37:45.507 --> 37:46.546
WOMAN: Yeah.

37:46.547 --> 37:47.717
Yeah, it leaves in a minute.

37:50.117 --> 37:52.716
I just know that if it's up to
a foot race between all of us,

37:52.717 --> 37:54.476
I know my dad and I can't keep up.

37:54.477 --> 37:55.997
Where do we go?

37:57.277 --> 38:00.506
I saw them, guys.
-Go, go, go, go!

38:00.507 --> 38:03.876
One minute?
Are you (BLEEP) kidding me?

38:03.877 --> 38:05.356
I see running.

38:05.357 --> 38:07.836
This train's still here.
-We gotta go.

38:07.837 --> 38:09.546
I'm just really nervous.

38:09.547 --> 38:11.356
They have to go under
and come back over.

38:11.357 --> 38:13.436
Guys, you're going to
see them walk right there.

38:13.437 --> 38:15.716
I love the models, but it wouldn't
be the worst thing

38:15.717 --> 38:17.066
if they didn't make this train.

38:17.067 --> 38:19.676
They're going to make it, guys.
They're going to make it.

38:19.677 --> 38:21.437
JESSICA: Our train is right here.

38:23.197 --> 38:24.506
(ALL GASP)

38:24.507 --> 38:26.236
DANA: Are we moving?!

38:26.237 --> 38:27.996
We missed the train.

38:27.997 --> 38:30.596
Could they have missed it?
-They aren't here.

38:30.597 --> 38:33.956
This could be the cushion we needed
to not get eliminated on this leg.

38:33.957 --> 38:36.757
We're literally
the only ones here.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.317
Alright, let's go inside.

38:41.637 --> 38:43.116
Wait.

38:43.117 --> 38:45.196
ASHLEY: Oh, my gosh.
OK, that's a train coming in.

38:45.197 --> 38:47.066
Burnie, just tell me two teams,
please.

38:47.067 --> 38:48.396
I will.
For the love of God.

38:48.397 --> 38:50.197
I can't even look myself.

38:53.917 --> 38:56.676
Look, there's everybody.
-Oh, my gosh.

38:56.677 --> 38:59.196
Burgundy girls.
-ALL: What?!

38:59.197 --> 39:00.436
BURNIE: Oh, they're there.

39:00.437 --> 39:03.116
BLAIR: Oh, my gosh. We've caught up
with the other teams.

39:03.117 --> 39:04.316
That's it.

39:04.317 --> 39:06.156
Get on that train.
Get on that train.

39:06.157 --> 39:08.506
Daddy, daughter.
-Daddy, daughter.

39:08.507 --> 39:12.796
All the teams are right there.
-Oh, my God.

39:12.797 --> 39:15.716
Everyone is here except the models.
-The models are not here?

39:15.717 --> 39:21.196
COLE: There's Zach, Dad,
hosts, hosts.

39:21.197 --> 39:23.196
BURNIE: Blair went down.
Blair went down.

39:23.197 --> 39:25.316
Are you OK, Blair?
-Are you OK, sweetie?

39:25.317 --> 39:28.066
Yeah, I'm good.
-Aww. Blair, are you OK?

39:28.067 --> 39:29.506
I'm good.

39:29.507 --> 39:31.477
She's sort of excited
to see you guys.

39:33.357 --> 39:37.196
DANA: We thought we were racing
for maybe fourth at best.

39:37.197 --> 39:39.276
We're racing for first again.

39:39.277 --> 39:41.067
Racing in the cold.

39:42.317 --> 39:43.676
BRITTANY: I can't believe
we're last.

39:43.677 --> 39:44.836
I didn't think we would be last.

39:44.837 --> 39:48.596

finish, whatever happens.

Whoever runs the fastest
without falling in the snow

40:00.547 --> 40:02.676
is going to get there first.

40:02.677 --> 40:05.196
If the models are going to be out,

40:05.197 --> 40:06.756
they would want us to win this leg
for them.

40:06.757 --> 40:08.276
Should we put on our wigs?

40:08.277 --> 40:10.066
(GASPS) Not yet.

40:10.067 --> 40:12.836
Go, go, go, go! -Let's go.

40:12.837 --> 40:14.796
Hurry.
-Whoo-hoo!

40:14.797 --> 40:16.636
BLAIR: Daddy.
-Let's go.

40:16.637 --> 40:18.546
Rachey, come on.
-I'm coming.

40:18.547 --> 40:20.356
COLE: Come on, Mama.
Got to keep going.

40:20.357 --> 40:21.916
Alright, look for it.

40:21.917 --> 40:23.596

PHIL: We've got more teams coming in
behind you.

40:35.677 --> 40:38.316
Nice and easy, guys. Easy, easy.

40:38.317 --> 40:41.996
Easy, easy. It's slippery.
It's slippery. Nice job, guys.

40:41.997 --> 40:44.236
Wow, look at this. Touch the mat,
you guys. Touch the mat.

40:44.237 --> 40:45.636
Both team members touch the mat.

40:45.637 --> 40:47.476
SCOTT: Good job, Cole.
Good job, Sheri.

40:47.477 --> 40:48.636
Alright.

Good job, good job. -You got it.

First on the mat today -
Brody and Kurt, team number one.

You have won $3,000 each!

41:11.917 --> 41:14.236
(ALL CHEER)

41:14.237 --> 41:15.506
Awesome.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.316
And can anyone remember a time

41:17.317 --> 41:19.506
when we had this many teams
on the mat at once?

41:19.507 --> 41:20.546
Has it ever happened?

41:20.547 --> 41:23.596
It did happen once, yes.
It was the All Stars season.

41:23.597 --> 41:26.756
Well, that makes sense, because
we're all All Stars here.

41:26.757 --> 41:28.716
We knew that there was
no weak teams.

41:28.717 --> 41:30.596
All these teams
have their strengths,

41:30.597 --> 41:33.236
and we have to stay on our game
to stay in this race.

41:35.277 --> 41:37.836
I'm really sad, Jessica.
-Me too.

41:37.837 --> 41:41.716
This race has been so awesome,
doing it with Brittany.

41:41.717 --> 41:44.236
But I feel like we needed more time.

41:44.237 --> 41:46.716
Brittany and Jessica,
I'm sorry to tell you

41:46.717 --> 41:48.996
that you are the last team to arrive

41:48.997 --> 41:50.716
and you have been eliminated
from the race.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.596
We knew it.
-Yeah, we knew.

41:52.597 --> 41:53.916
We were ready.
-It was fun, though.

41:53.917 --> 41:56.396
I couldn't imagine
picking another partner.

41:56.397 --> 41:58.506
She's just like my other half.

41:58.507 --> 42:01.476
She's, like, the exact same
person as me.

42:01.477 --> 42:03.396
You're going to make me cry.

42:03.397 --> 42:05.876
It's alright.
You can let your tears go.

42:05.877 --> 42:09.836
I'm so thankful. She's so intuitive
and intelligent and she's beautiful.
