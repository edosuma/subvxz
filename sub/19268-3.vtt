01:04.739 --> 01:12.110
The dead boy is the final proof of a humans existence.

01:12.110 --> 01:15.960
But, when standing in front of the rotten and bloody body...

01:15.960 --> 01:18.900
It's hard to respect or show manners.

01:20.020 --> 01:22.550
Because of that horror...

01:22.550 --> 01:26.060
You ignore what kind of life that person was living...

01:26.060 --> 01:28.390
And you end up treating them like objects.

01:29.390 --> 01:34.710
The moment he or she calls in the culprit and loses their dignity...

01:34.710 --> 01:38.840
...is the moment you find the first error in the investigation.

01:38.840 --> 01:44.200
So! To conclude the Introduction to Criminology course you'll be taking this semester...

01:44.200 --> 01:47.180
You never know where or when you're going to die.

01:47.180 --> 01:49.560
So, always wear clean underwear.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.710
Dismissed.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.050
Episode 3

03:49.960 --> 03:53.300
Counterattack of the Lonely

04:41.050 --> 04:45.850
I will die on the first Wednesday of March.

04:46.770 --> 04:49.070
The blade of a living death...

04:49.070 --> 04:53.170
...stabbed me three times...
finally causing me to die.

04:53.170 --> 04:57.670
Even though I am dead...

04:57.670 --> 05:02.410
I am living through all of you,
so my death is not in vain.

05:02.410 --> 05:04.830
When you touch the sorrow inside the dried blood...

05:04.830 --> 05:06.970
The torn skin is recovering...

05:06.970 --> 05:10.340
And in the fractured bones...
That's where you will find me.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.820
Pedantic metaphors...
He's still the same as before.

05:13.820 --> 05:15.620
But, isn't this a bit much?

05:15.620 --> 05:18.430
Writing a will on scratch paper...

05:18.430 --> 05:20.720
Illegal weapons...

05:20.720 --> 05:23.060
What kind of things was he doing in a place full of students?

05:23.060 --> 05:26.260
The Investigation Legend himself finished his legacy in vain.

05:32.350 --> 05:33.260
Who's that?

05:35.490 --> 05:37.090
White rose?

05:38.370 --> 05:41.110
Did he even deserve to have a pure love?

05:42.150 --> 05:44.530
Maybe she's Professor Kang's...

05:47.140 --> 05:49.700
White roses symbolize respect.

06:30.650 --> 06:33.110
You're not permitted to enter this crime scene.

06:38.730 --> 06:42.130
Are you Yeo Ji Hoon?

06:42.130 --> 06:44.660
Famous for the F-case...

06:45.890 --> 06:49.740
He told me that there was only 1 F student in his entire career.

06:49.740 --> 06:53.290
I'm honored to be standing in front of a living legend.

06:55.660 --> 06:58.300
Can this suicide location be considered as a crime scene?

06:59.360 --> 07:00.980
This is not a suicide.

07:01.910 --> 07:04.980
The gunpowder found on Professor Kang's hands have already been checked.

07:04.980 --> 07:06.890
His handwriting on the suicide note...

07:07.510 --> 07:10.220
Video camera footage...
Everything was checked.

07:11.730 --> 07:15.120
I'm sure you're aware.
This doesn't match his character.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.940
If he had to commit suicide...

07:16.940 --> 07:19.770
Whether it's trying his neck or electrocuting himself...

07:19.770 --> 07:23.300
He would've used a cleaner method.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.060
There's no point in doing that.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.520
It's already broken because of a virus.

08:03.930 --> 08:05.010
I'm not sure...

08:05.590 --> 08:07.820
There's no indication that he was murdered.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.320
I'm talking about the smoldering marks near the wound.

08:13.870 --> 08:15.710
Don't people who usually shoot themselves hold the muzzle...

08:15.710 --> 08:18.670
... close to their face and then pull the trigger?

08:19.410 --> 08:21.960
If that was the case, those smoldering marks wouldn't be there.

08:23.090 --> 08:27.730
Was it on contact or close to it?
The autopsy team was surprised too.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.830
Who knows?

08:29.830 --> 08:32.860
Why he pulled the trigger as he was dropping the muzzle.

08:32.860 --> 08:36.710
The only thing that's certain is that he pulled the trigger with his own hand.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.210
To establish this as a murder, you need guesses like:

08:40.210 --> 08:42.500
Someone forced the Professor to sit down...

08:42.500 --> 08:45.700
...and pull the trigger using his own fingers.

08:46.670 --> 08:48.860
But, I heard there were no traces of another person there.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.230
Are you still seeing that girl from before?

09:03.410 --> 09:05.490
I never meet the same girl twice.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.150
It's tiring.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.530
So...

09:17.530 --> 09:19.530
I guess that means you have no reason to see me.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.860
Will you see the truth or will you know the truth?

09:36.860 --> 09:41.080
Do you think you can just forget that one moment of doubt?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.430
You'll find yourself thinking about that doubt constantly...

09:43.430 --> 09:46.200
...and that doubt will grow bigger and bigger over time.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.930
Until later, it'll erode your entire soul.

09:51.990 --> 09:56.170
When a sharp thought passes through your conscious...

09:56.170 --> 09:59.150
You need to overcome the obstacle of confirmation and verification.

09:59.150 --> 10:01.620
When you finally pass the countless amount of obstacles...

10:01.620 --> 10:06.380
You'll reach the bottom of the truth about human beings.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.710
Ok, let's decide.

10:09.790 --> 10:12.620
Either you become a petty police,
who becomes the monster's bait...

10:12.620 --> 10:16.540
...living a life without ambition.

10:16.540 --> 10:17.810
Or!

10:17.810 --> 10:23.050
You can become a bold police who can swallow the monster.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.570
I'd like to confirm everyone that's been inside this room since yesterday.

10:54.570 --> 10:59.130
<i>We're not allowed to video record.
It puts us in a difficult situation.</i>

11:08.240 --> 11:09.550
This is Yeo Ji Hoon.

11:09.550 --> 11:12.840
<i>You should come over here.
I'm at the murder site!</i>

11:45.320 --> 11:46.620
<i>Here!</i>

12:03.630 --> 12:08.040
From the looks of the blood,
it seems like its been there for days.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.790
But where could the body be?

12:10.790 --> 12:14.250
With this kind of bleeding,
it was definitely a murder.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.790
See. What did I tell you?

12:17.790 --> 12:20.320
Professor Kang didn't simply commit suicide-

12:22.210 --> 12:23.420
How did you come here?

12:24.300 --> 12:25.470
What did you follow?

12:35.370 --> 12:37.840
It was at the hotel he was staying in.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.380
You haven't been there yet?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.100
Someone delivered a bloody book.

12:47.790 --> 12:49.000
<i>Delivery!</i>

12:50.120 --> 12:51.590
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

12:54.050 --> 12:57.360
I'm dropping off a parcel.
Where is Yang Sang Man?

12:59.480 --> 13:00.540
That's me.

13:14.450 --> 13:16.890
Professor Kang and Yang Sang Man...

13:16.890 --> 13:19.350
Sent parcels to each other?

13:37.640 --> 13:39.370
The handwriting looks the same.

13:39.370 --> 13:40.820
It was sent by the same person.

13:42.140 --> 13:43.900
This is a planned murder.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.580
It's also a continuous murder.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.160
First, Chapter 1: The Life of a Stranger...

13:52.560 --> 13:54.900
Then, Chapter 2: Secret Note

14:04.760 --> 14:06.580
Next is Chapter 3.

14:09.190 --> 14:10.680
The Counterattack of the Lonely.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.860
He said he'd be at the funeral service...

14:21.860 --> 14:24.370
But, he keeps making these funerals!

14:24.370 --> 14:26.370
Is he a funeral consultant or what?

14:26.370 --> 14:28.280
He's someone who doesn't have time to mourn.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.750
Your complaints are a bit much, Min Ho.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.300
Let's try to grow up.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.730
All this nagging affection...

14:39.160 --> 14:40.930
It's kind of uncomfortable.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.010
This invoice number belongs to that person, right?

14:50.010 --> 14:53.470
Yes, that invoice matches with the time it was issued.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.140
The sender was Kang Yoon Goo.

14:57.930 --> 15:01.070
Are there any other packages sent by this person?

15:01.780 --> 15:02.970
No.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.850
You can copy the camera footage, right?

15:04.850 --> 15:05.740
Yes.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.640
This person is the sender.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.250
Yang Sang man.

15:16.030 --> 15:17.540
Is this the only package he sent?

15:17.540 --> 15:19.050
Yes.

15:19.050 --> 15:20.270
It seems like it.

15:21.890 --> 15:24.260
It'll be hard to get a specific suspect.

15:25.130 --> 15:29.950
No security deposit, no fees.
Why would I write a contract?

15:29.950 --> 15:32.740
There should at least be a rent deposit statement.

15:32.740 --> 15:35.530
We got it in cash, 3 months worth in advance.

15:35.530 --> 15:38.020
We collect it on behalf of the owner.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.730
Getting the money and seeing their face are 2 different things!

15:42.600 --> 15:46.560
Someone died and you don't even know who lived there.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.160
I'm speechless.

15:49.410 --> 15:52.530
So, there's no way of contacting the tenant whatsoever?

15:52.530 --> 15:54.970
What contact?
We just collect the money.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.410
If they don't pay, we change the lock. End of story.

15:58.580 --> 15:59.990
Okay, fine.

15:59.990 --> 16:04.030
We'll need to draw his montage so stay here for now.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.930
I'm not that good at drawing.

16:11.030 --> 16:12.680
Even thought this is a crime ridden district...

16:12.680 --> 16:14.710
There are virtually no security cameras around.

16:14.710 --> 16:17.070
Finding the body isn't going to be easy.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.110
Director!

16:25.410 --> 16:27.360
Has the victim's identity been confirmed?

16:27.980 --> 16:29.040
No.

16:30.170 --> 16:33.130
Where the 3rd chapter was sent to...

16:33.130 --> 16:36.940
Who this victim was...
How this relates to Professor Kang...

16:36.940 --> 16:39.320
Where the body is hidden...

16:39.320 --> 16:40.740
We don't know any of these things yet.

16:42.390 --> 16:44.400
There's so many things to find.

16:45.110 --> 16:46.730
But, fortunately...

16:46.730 --> 16:48.920
Even though the criminals knows how to hide the clues...

16:48.920 --> 16:50.470
They also know that it's going to spill over.

16:51.660 --> 16:55.990
Yeh Ri, take charge here.
I'll be at Professor Kang's crime scene.

16:55.990 --> 16:58.340
I need to know the clues this guy is spilling around.

16:59.490 --> 17:03.190
For this round, we need to run where this guy is leading us.

17:53.930 --> 17:56.460
He took the book out before letting the blood dry.

18:07.530 --> 18:09.240
3:00 PM

18:09.240 --> 18:11.880
He was waiting for someone.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.780
Could it be the criminal?

18:23.530 --> 18:26.430
Last call at 2:57,

18:27.540 --> 18:30.390
011-992-1131.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.720
Did you know?

18:53.720 --> 18:58.260
Professor Kang often said that you were just like him.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.510
Did he?

19:02.560 --> 19:04.700
If the last is true...

19:05.460 --> 19:07.820
There's a terrible version coming in the future.

19:07.820 --> 19:08.960
Right.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.770
He wasn't just saying that.

19:11.770 --> 19:15.060
He said that you and him were two of a kind.

19:16.550 --> 19:20.770
Suicide note writing too...
Used paper...

19:23.240 --> 19:26.090
I guess he wrote the suicide note here in this place.

19:30.650 --> 19:32.790
What were the winning lottery numbers for last week?

19:37.550 --> 19:43.670
3, 14, 18, 29, 35, 36.
Bonus number 33.

19:44.470 --> 19:45.570
The week before that?

19:45.570 --> 19:49.870
6, 12, 13, 28, 33, 42.
Bonus number 22.

19:51.860 --> 19:55.150
Numbers that are unrelated to the winning numbers...

20:29.090 --> 20:31.040
This movie is so old.

20:54.180 --> 20:57.790
The poster has a splatter of blood?

21:30.370 --> 21:31.990
Old clothes...

21:32.990 --> 21:34.500
Old TV...

21:36.040 --> 21:37.100
Fridge...

21:40.470 --> 21:42.830
Even the poster...

21:46.200 --> 21:48.770
This is a set.

21:50.010 --> 21:51.630
A set reliving the past.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.860
Yeah?

22:08.860 --> 22:09.940
Director?

22:09.940 --> 22:14.220
The crime scene is a set created to recreate the past.

22:14.220 --> 22:17.360
This place is filled with furniture with no signs of usage.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.960
What does this mean?

22:22.960 --> 22:24.800
Recreating the past?

22:29.730 --> 22:32.390
If it's the past, what year did he try to recreate?

22:32.390 --> 22:34.830
What? When...

22:43.800 --> 22:44.840
It's here.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.490
1992!

22:52.630 --> 22:54.160
How did you know?

22:54.920 --> 22:57.960
This friendly criminal is calling for us.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.020
Everyone meet at the office.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.160
1992-011131

23:12.040 --> 23:15.980
4-digit year followed by a 6-digit number.

23:15.980 --> 23:19.180
That's a police number!

23:21.380 --> 23:22.400
So...

23:23.180 --> 23:27.240
Should we find out why this guy is leaving puzzles here and there?

23:31.260 --> 23:34.880
Before I being the briefing...

23:34.880 --> 23:37.340
May I ask who that person is?

23:38.330 --> 23:40.840
He's the self proclaimed Ace of the Police University.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.240
Wait.

23:53.790 --> 23:55.200
Kang Yoon Goo?

23:57.750 --> 23:58.940
Let's start.

23:59.830 --> 24:03.290
In 1992, pimp Yang Sang Man and his rival, Jung Nam Soo...

24:03.290 --> 24:05.710
...argued over the income shares in the brothel industry...

24:05.710 --> 24:07.850
...eventually leading to murder.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.350
Jung Nam Soo, who had a criminal record at that time...

24:23.350 --> 24:27.220
...lied and said that he was fishing for the first time during the crime.

24:27.220 --> 24:29.560
In order to dispose the body,
Jung Nam Soo, who always loved

24:29.560 --> 24:31.270
...fishing, tied the limbs with...

24:31.270 --> 24:36.090
...a fishing line, which later became an important piece of evidence.

24:36.090 --> 24:40.130
He put the body in a bag and dumped it into the reservoir.

24:40.130 --> 24:43.030
Detective Kang Yoon Goo obtained exclusive evidence and witnesses.

24:43.030 --> 24:47.980
He got the culprit to confess and ended the case in just 2 days.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.530
This is a bit unrelated but...

24:51.530 --> 24:55.330
After the case, there were 2 crazy dogs found nearby.

24:55.330 --> 24:59.090
One died and the other became good luck.

25:00.460 --> 25:04.820
Why would the culprit bring back a case that's over 20 years old?

25:05.410 --> 25:09.320
If he recreated the same scene from 20 years ago...

25:09.320 --> 25:12.410
That means this person was deeply involved with this case.

25:14.790 --> 25:15.960
Wait.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.770
Go back.

25:18.770 --> 25:20.770
Stop.

25:20.770 --> 25:21.820
There.

25:31.180 --> 25:32.630
Director.

25:32.630 --> 25:36.180
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?

25:38.340 --> 25:40.040
I need to go back to the scene.

27:23.490 --> 27:26.790
Detective Kang Yoon Goo

27:31.490 --> 27:34.820
Director, if you just tell us what you're looking for...

27:45.480 --> 27:47.960
This is a woman's slipper. 240mm.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.980
But the shoes in the past crime scene were different.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.560
Oh, that's right.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.730
The footprint at that time says 280.

27:59.730 --> 28:01.730
They found a black men's slipper.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.520
But, why does that matter?

28:05.520 --> 28:07.520
A slipper is a slipper.

28:17.820 --> 28:21.000
Oh! That wasn't there in the past crime!

28:23.400 --> 28:26.770
The criminal who perfectly recreated the crime scene...

28:26.770 --> 28:28.760
...left out 2 things.

28:30.930 --> 28:33.630
This fishing bag and slipper.

28:33.630 --> 28:35.320
Is this a coincidence?

28:35.320 --> 28:38.190
Does this mean he left a hidden meaning?

28:39.270 --> 28:43.620
The criminal who recreated this scene is leaving a message.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.210
Message?

28:46.210 --> 28:51.880
Someone manipulated this message from the past crime.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.450
Manipulated?

28:55.700 --> 28:59.680
Unfortunately, I think the criminal's claims are true.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.310
But why?

29:07.560 --> 29:10.560
This critical evidence,
Jung Nam Soo's fishing rod.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.850
This just proves that Jung Nam Soo was not the criminal.

29:14.950 --> 29:16.640
This fishing rod can only be used at sea.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.760
The Jung Nam Soo who visited local reservoirs...

29:18.760 --> 29:21.410
...would have no reason to have this sea fishing rod.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.410
If my guess is correct,

29:26.410 --> 29:32.100
I think the culprit who recreated this scene placed this rod here.

29:41.010 --> 29:43.040
This is a freshwater fishing rod.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.030
So, does this mean that Professor Kang's death had something to do...

29:48.030 --> 29:51.810
...with this person's crime operation?

29:53.280 --> 29:55.360
You guys can stop it now.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.650
Seeing a bunch of pros falling for the bait so quickly.

29:58.650 --> 30:00.380
I'm more embarrassed.

30:01.890 --> 30:04.310
I don't think this is a place for students.

30:04.310 --> 30:05.940
What's wrong with you?

30:05.940 --> 30:08.160
I can't speak for the others but of all people,

30:08.160 --> 30:09.850
you should know what kind of person Professor Kang was.

30:11.190 --> 30:14.690
What we need to know is not Kang Yoon Goo, the professor.

30:16.250 --> 30:18.580
But, Kang Yoon Goo, the Detective.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.600
After all, Kang Yoon Goo, the Detective was the one murdered.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.690
Senior!

30:23.690 --> 30:25.650
I don't want to admit it either.

30:25.650 --> 30:30.060
But, right now we have no choice but to reach out to the criminal.

30:43.820 --> 30:46.020
So, for this case...

30:46.020 --> 30:48.510
It's likely that Jung Nam Soo,
who was framed and who...

30:48.510 --> 30:51.080
...served for 20 years,
decorated this scene.

30:51.080 --> 30:58.150
For revenge against Professor Kang who led this investigation...

30:59.470 --> 31:02.300
But, who died here then?

31:02.300 --> 31:04.900
Yang Sang Man already died in the past.

31:06.430 --> 31:10.820
Wouldn't the answer be in the reservoir that had Yang Sang Man's body?

31:10.820 --> 31:13.780
If Jung Nam Soo continues this revenge...

31:13.780 --> 31:17.350
The next target would be the actual killer of the past.

31:17.350 --> 31:21.050
The last chapter should be delivered over there.

31:21.050 --> 31:24.360
If they waited 20 years for this revenge...

31:26.560 --> 31:29.120
They'll definitely see this to the end.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.010
Hurry and look into the Jung Nam Soo case material.

31:32.010 --> 31:34.010
We need to find the Cinderella.

31:34.010 --> 31:38.630
I think he's saying that the owner of this shoe was the real criminal.

32:12.550 --> 32:16.210
Criminal arrest in 48 hours.

32:17.530 --> 32:22.420
After that case,
Professor Kang became legendary.

32:22.420 --> 32:26.800
After media attention,
he got a promotion rather quickly.

32:28.210 --> 32:29.590
Forget it.

32:29.590 --> 32:32.470
They all came from that era.

32:32.470 --> 32:35.090
Rather than catching 10 criminals...

32:36.860 --> 32:39.560
He shouldn't have made 1 poor person into a criminal.

32:40.580 --> 32:43.210
He was a person who taught while coughing out blood.

32:43.210 --> 32:47.240
Back in the day,
there were no limits to the law.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.760
Carrying the burden of solving the problems for the dead...

32:51.760 --> 32:55.430
...is impolite to your teacher.

32:57.270 --> 32:59.650
Just concentrate on closing this case.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.000
Isn't it all over for Professor Kang?

33:13.490 --> 33:14.890
It's over.

33:30.110 --> 33:33.400
There are no inmates named Jung Nam Soo.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.200
Are you sure that name is correct?

33:35.910 --> 33:38.110
Yes. That's strange.

33:38.110 --> 33:41.250
If he was sentenced for 20 years,
he should've been released by now.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.440
Right.

33:42.440 --> 33:45.230
But, there are some sentences that extend for longer.

33:45.230 --> 33:48.820
If they commit more crimes...
if they cause a scene in the facilities...

33:52.450 --> 33:53.790
No way.

33:53.790 --> 33:55.650
<i>We found it!</i>

34:10.030 --> 34:11.239
A woman?

34:12.040 --> 34:15.670
Ugh, why is it a woman all of a sudden?

34:48.670 --> 34:49.860
What is this?

34:50.920 --> 34:52.710
Where is the body?

34:59.440 --> 35:02.230
If you go there, you see outfits like this all the time.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.650
Where?

35:03.650 --> 35:04.730
A brothel.

35:07.870 --> 35:09.790
I just got a call from the lab.

35:09.790 --> 35:12.780
What the hell is going on?

35:12.780 --> 35:15.570
We got the blood sample results from the crime scene.

35:15.570 --> 35:17.170
But, it's very strange.

35:18.090 --> 35:20.760
It's not human blood.
It's pig's blood.

35:22.030 --> 35:23.500
Pig's blood?

35:29.880 --> 35:31.760
Instead of the body...

35:32.710 --> 35:35.310
We got a clue about the real murderer.

35:40.450 --> 35:44.430
You're right.
Red slipper. Same size, 240.

35:45.790 --> 35:47.870
The method of leaving clues...

35:49.430 --> 35:51.260
Isn't it a little too loud?

36:00.390 --> 36:01.640
Director!

36:01.640 --> 36:04.200
I looked into Jung Nam Soo's whereabouts!

36:05.490 --> 36:06.570
Where is he?

36:06.570 --> 36:09.640
Jung Nam Soo is still in prison.

36:10.310 --> 36:11.640
Prison?

36:11.640 --> 36:14.680
He was recently involved in a lawsuit days before his release.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.100
Because of that,
his release has been delayed.

36:20.990 --> 36:23.390
Jung Nam Soo is still in prison.

36:24.540 --> 36:27.110
What? What does that mean?

36:27.830 --> 36:30.550
Jung Nam Soo in prison?
Then-

36:31.420 --> 36:33.670
This is getting more interesting.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.560
<i>Senior! It's me, Lee Ho.</i>

36:56.560 --> 36:59.070
<i>I heard that Jung Nam Soo hasn't been released.</i>

36:59.980 --> 37:03.160
<i>See. I told you something was wrong.</i>

37:03.160 --> 37:05.510
<i>Professor Kang isn't that kind of person!</i>

37:12.390 --> 37:15.600
The Revenge is Mine

37:57.490 --> 37:58.770
Like a viper.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.630
Drink it.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.830
So cute.

38:35.490 --> 38:37.450
Come over sometime.

38:37.450 --> 38:39.480
I'll get you a ticket.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.990
What kind of talk is that to a police doing an investigation?

38:45.300 --> 38:46.810
Who did you say you were looking for?

38:50.510 --> 38:53.610
The woman who used to wear this button a long time ago.

38:53.610 --> 38:54.820
What is this?

38:55.570 --> 38:58.600
I heard they used to call this place the "White House."

38:58.600 --> 39:00.460
Because all the girls always wore white dresses.

39:00.460 --> 39:03.880
That's a name I haven't heard in a while.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.920
But how would I know who #4 was?

39:06.920 --> 39:10.000
Only the girls chosen by the pimps wore the #4 button.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.110
Other guys hardly chose #4 girls,
saying they were disgusting.

39:13.110 --> 39:15.960
How do you know so well?

39:19.680 --> 39:23.160
My uncle...
No, not my uncle-

39:23.160 --> 39:25.190
I've been here a few times, okay!

39:26.360 --> 39:29.020
Where do you hear these things?

39:30.150 --> 39:31.730
You're wrong about something.

39:31.730 --> 39:35.990
Girls who were loved by the pimps wore the #4 button.

39:35.990 --> 39:37.760
The girls who were hated...

39:37.760 --> 39:40.660
Or owed a lot of debt wore #7.

39:43.850 --> 39:47.160
Who is the girl that the dead Yang Sang Man liked?

39:48.400 --> 39:51.590
Soon Ae.
Kim Soon Ae was the last girl.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.160
But, I heard she went to America.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.240
America?

39:58.230 --> 40:01.630
There was a Kim Soon Ae that Yang Sang Man especially liked.

40:01.630 --> 40:04.440
But she's been in America for the past 20 years.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.890
America?

40:10.110 --> 40:11.230
White rose.

40:11.230 --> 40:12.570
What?

40:12.570 --> 40:14.000
White rose?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.550
Looks like she was there.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.040
Kim Soon Ae was in Korea since yesterday.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.020
Find someone in similar age with recent entry to America.

40:22.020 --> 40:25.130
If they lived their for 20 years,
they could've changed their name.

40:25.130 --> 40:26.650
Yes.

40:26.650 --> 40:27.660
Hello?

40:29.090 --> 40:32.740
Why can't you ever give me a compliment?!

40:59.640 --> 41:01.000
Why are you here?

41:02.040 --> 41:04.120
Shouldn't you be outside?

41:04.530 --> 41:06.710
There was a situation.

41:09.130 --> 41:11.430
To plan your revenge...

41:12.590 --> 41:14.340
Looks like you did some training.

41:15.250 --> 41:17.260
You have a fit body.

41:18.350 --> 41:22.090
Do you know about me?

41:23.080 --> 41:24.090
Very well.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.620
You've been like this for 20 years.

41:28.420 --> 41:29.620
Framed.

41:35.080 --> 41:39.470
These are all of #2056's belongings.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.300
It's all letters.

41:42.300 --> 41:45.740
These are probably over 10 years old.

41:45.740 --> 41:48.100
He values these a lot.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.480
These were all sent by one person.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.960
One person?

41:53.960 --> 41:55.960
Did you say revenge?

41:58.710 --> 42:01.940
It's true that there was once a time where that's all I thought about.

42:01.940 --> 42:03.000
But...

42:04.210 --> 42:05.890
I forgot about it all.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.200
Forgot?

42:11.100 --> 42:13.390
That couldn't have been easy.

42:14.740 --> 42:16.210
20 years...

42:17.780 --> 42:19.600
Have you ever thought about it?

42:21.810 --> 42:26.090
Having things happen that I never could imagine happening...

42:26.090 --> 42:27.950
...is a long time.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.890
Did I get tired of it?

42:33.330 --> 42:35.470
Probably so.

42:38.020 --> 42:40.290
In 1994...

42:40.290 --> 42:44.700
After failing to commit suicide two times, I received a box of letters.

42:45.400 --> 42:50.000
There was a rehab program where people wrote letters to prisoners.

42:51.640 --> 42:55.970
I didn't respond at first but I started to open my heart little by little.

42:57.010 --> 43:00.160
This person believed I was framed and was the only person...

43:01.760 --> 43:03.770
...to remember me.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.960
After that, I got a large lump of metal.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.000
The thoughts of wanting to die...

43:11.000 --> 43:14.850
Whenever I wanted to die,
I started to shave it.

43:16.990 --> 43:18.930
With the heaviest heart...

43:19.860 --> 43:22.170
I started to make it lighter.

43:26.540 --> 43:28.290
What a great pen pal.

43:31.100 --> 43:36.490
When I get released,
we agreed to go sea fishing.

43:40.290 --> 43:42.050
Such a nice story.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.120
Even agreeing to go fishing.

43:46.460 --> 43:49.100
You know that Detective Kang Yoon Goo is dead, right?

43:52.320 --> 43:53.480
That person...

43:55.000 --> 43:56.270
...is dead?

43:57.740 --> 43:58.910
Yes.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.230
Shot in the head.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.480
How?

44:05.480 --> 44:06.890
Did you know?

44:08.040 --> 44:09.680
That the case was manipulated...

44:10.820 --> 44:12.320
By that Detective...

44:21.350 --> 44:23.260
20 years ago...

44:24.560 --> 44:29.530
As he turned off the recording,
he said to my ear...

44:30.460 --> 44:34.260
"Have you ever lived like a human being?"

44:35.350 --> 44:37.120
"This is your chance."

44:38.260 --> 44:40.540
"You're saving a precious person."

44:43.670 --> 44:44.950
So you knew.

44:48.140 --> 44:49.180
I'll see you again.

44:55.630 --> 44:58.030
Back to that story...

44:59.240 --> 45:03.870
With a heavy heart,
trying to make it light or something...

45:05.080 --> 45:06.810
It's a great story.

45:07.910 --> 45:09.770
But, you're telling the wrong person.

45:10.550 --> 45:13.330
Revenge is my specialty.
I know all about it.

45:15.040 --> 45:19.300
That you try to endure but there's no better painkiller than revenge.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.790
That the thought of revenge is never tiring.

45:23.970 --> 45:26.010
That the murder is a debt.

45:27.090 --> 45:29.490
And as time goes by...

45:31.840 --> 45:33.860
You'll soon repay it.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.990
It's already mid winter.

45:43.990 --> 45:47.970
They say that winter is better than summer in prison but...

45:47.970 --> 45:50.940
It can't be better than being outside.

45:52.730 --> 45:55.200
I have a disease.

45:55.200 --> 45:58.120
The doctors say it's Alzheimer's.

45:58.120 --> 46:03.150
While clutching the handles,
I sometimes forget who I am.

46:03.150 --> 46:06.870
Although I can't understand your pain...

46:06.870 --> 46:10.810
I know that you will be rewarded in the future.

46:10.810 --> 46:12.810
Whichever way.

46:12.810 --> 46:17.170
That's the revenge for the people who made you like this.

46:17.170 --> 46:20.280
Take care of your health.
Goodbye.

46:25.490 --> 46:27.670
Here's a photo that will make your troubles disappear.

46:27.670 --> 46:30.630
Let's go fishing together sometime.

46:31.910 --> 46:33.580
Kim Sam Gil.

46:34.330 --> 46:36.130
I almost forgot.

46:36.130 --> 46:39.520
This package came for #2056.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.400
Package?

46:41.400 --> 46:45.100
There was a recent disturbance so I forgot to give it to him.

46:45.100 --> 46:48.730
It's from Kim Sam Gil again.
It looks like a book.

46:50.090 --> 46:51.220
Book.

46:51.850 --> 46:53.420
Book!

47:05.690 --> 47:08.370
These were all made by Jung Nam Soo, right?

47:08.370 --> 47:10.750
Yes, that's right.

47:10.750 --> 47:12.760
Every break he had...

47:12.760 --> 47:15.540
He would just quietly...
very quietly...

47:15.540 --> 47:18.030
It became a hobby.

47:18.030 --> 47:19.740
If these are his skills...

47:20.520 --> 47:23.500
Looks like he could make just about anything with iron.

47:23.500 --> 47:24.780
Iron?

47:25.600 --> 47:28.780
For example, like a pistol.

47:29.730 --> 47:31.180
Pistol?

47:32.040 --> 47:33.150
Director!

47:36.820 --> 47:39.010
The only person related to Jung Nam Soo...

47:39.010 --> 47:41.530
...is the person who sent this package, Kim Sam Gil.

47:42.380 --> 47:43.530
Kim Sam Gil?

47:43.530 --> 47:46.070
They've been sending letters back and forth for 10 years.

47:46.070 --> 47:49.210
Jung Nam Soo has no family and never had a visitor in 20 years.

47:50.980 --> 47:53.540
Similar handwriting to the previous package.

47:53.540 --> 48:00.000
Then did Kim Sam Gil deliver the book and kill on his behalf?

48:01.380 --> 48:04.990
But, why was the third book delivered here?

48:04.990 --> 48:10.140
That doesn't make sense if it was supposed to be the next murder.

48:14.980 --> 48:17.360
He received the last book himself.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.790
He'll shave the metal for the last time?

48:25.950 --> 48:27.050
Disturbing.

48:28.110 --> 48:31.050
We became attracted to the prime suspect, Jung Nam Soo.

48:31.050 --> 48:33.660
And during this confusion there arose a new objective.

48:35.010 --> 48:37.120
By objective, you mean?

48:37.120 --> 48:38.790
The next target.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.700
Director, I found it!

48:47.700 --> 48:49.390
Name: Sarah Kim.

48:49.390 --> 48:51.630
She's the only woman with a similar age.

48:51.630 --> 48:52.910
She returned to her home country 3 days ago.

48:52.910 --> 48:56.280
Her Korean address is at Residence Hotel.

48:56.280 --> 48:59.110
Hurry and head out with the police squad.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.700
Kim Soon Ae is in danger!

49:02.700 --> 49:04.070
Soon Ae!

49:04.720 --> 49:06.070
Soon Ae!

49:10.730 --> 49:12.090
There's no one here.

49:16.050 --> 49:17.970
What's going on?

51:05.230 --> 51:06.790
Room 1508.

51:10.720 --> 51:14.340
I don't know this Jung Nam Soo...

51:14.340 --> 51:17.300
Or this Kim Sam Gil.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.470
What's your relation with Detective Kang?

51:25.000 --> 51:28.430
Just... someone I knew from a long time ago.

51:29.670 --> 51:35.070
I returned to Korea because I was invited by Detective Kang.

51:35.070 --> 51:38.340
He wanted to know how I would feel coming back after so long.

51:38.340 --> 51:41.800
He accommodated this place so I stayed.

51:41.800 --> 51:46.100
I hadn't heard from him so I went to his school only to hear that he died.

51:47.220 --> 51:49.320
Detective Kang was murdered.

51:50.790 --> 51:52.930
I don't think Professor Kang invited you.

51:52.930 --> 51:54.230
I think the criminal did.

51:57.510 --> 51:59.010
Why me?

52:00.390 --> 52:03.760
The next target is you, Sarah Kim.

52:03.760 --> 52:04.820
No-

52:06.270 --> 52:07.780
The next target is you,
Kim Soon Ae.

52:09.880 --> 52:13.360
The real murderer of Yang Sang Man 20 years ago.

52:20.410 --> 52:21.730
I guess I'm right.

52:25.240 --> 52:30.940
The person who was framed 20 years ago is committing murder.

52:32.930 --> 52:34.840
To those who framed him.

52:36.200 --> 52:39.940
What happened 20 years ago?

52:51.830 --> 52:55.830
I wanted to leave that place.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.430
With my child...

52:59.490 --> 53:00.670
That...

53:01.540 --> 53:03.510
That was all.

53:05.990 --> 53:08.540
If I wanted to leave that sick place...

53:09.450 --> 53:12.240
I had to kill one of them.

53:17.450 --> 53:20.630
If I erased the kid, they said that they would let me go.

53:21.630 --> 53:25.480
But I knew that was a lie.

53:25.480 --> 53:29.610
It had happened to #3 and #6.

53:30.280 --> 53:32.610
That's why I killed him.

53:34.620 --> 53:36.910
And I even surrendered.

53:39.440 --> 53:41.260
But then he came.

53:41.260 --> 53:43.380
The person who answered my phone call.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.750
Like a savior.

53:57.950 --> 54:01.430
Detective Kang then told me that...

54:02.210 --> 54:07.590
Only people who deserve to be protected will be protected by law.

54:09.040 --> 54:12.400
And with those words,
I went to America.

54:14.060 --> 54:15.770
Just like that.

54:20.500 --> 54:23.830
Yes, I killed him.

54:25.580 --> 54:30.580
But thanks to Detective Kang,
my child grew up well.

54:32.010 --> 54:36.980
But why did that person die?

54:40.550 --> 54:45.220
I might be late but I'll now take my punishment.

54:56.910 --> 55:01.240
Kim Soon Ae... Are you a person worthy of protection?

55:03.980 --> 55:05.910
Perhaps you should get the police to protect you.

55:06.950 --> 55:10.320
Because we don't judge a person's worth during our investigations.

55:20.590 --> 55:22.540
Detective Kang Yoon Goo.

55:23.340 --> 55:25.130
What have you done?

55:26.080 --> 55:28.420
Why did you play savior all of a sudden?

55:31.750 --> 55:35.300
I apologize. You were right.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.360
A month before Jung Nam Soo's release...

55:38.360 --> 55:40.530
Professor Kang became anxious.

55:40.530 --> 55:44.160
He got rid of his house and lived in a hotel.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.070
After not seeing you in a month,
I thought you gave up on this case.

55:50.990 --> 55:54.630
Furthermore, right before he died...

55:54.630 --> 55:56.770
He left evidence of murder.

55:56.770 --> 55:58.090
Very secretly.

56:02.390 --> 56:03.730
His will.

56:04.570 --> 56:10.410
In that moment, he left a secret message that only he would understand.

56:13.390 --> 56:18.060
The blade of a living death stabbed me three times.

56:18.860 --> 56:20.850
The blade of the living death...

56:20.850 --> 56:23.190
...is the tragedy of the manipulated murder scene.

56:23.190 --> 56:26.260
"The dried blood" -  the bloody book.

56:26.260 --> 56:28.660
"The Third Lie"

56:28.660 --> 56:33.290
The torn skin recovering probably indicates Jung Nam Soo's revenge.

56:36.740 --> 56:39.190
This is getting more disgusting.

56:39.190 --> 56:42.760
During his last moments,
he's not admitting his wrong.

56:44.050 --> 56:47.230
Instead, he's begging for him to let go of the unfairness.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.140
Detective Kang Yoon Goo.

56:53.960 --> 56:57.140
This case is getting more tiring.

56:58.540 --> 57:01.850
Finding Kim Sam Gil

57:07.430 --> 57:08.900
Another search came up.

57:09.720 --> 57:12.770
But he's a 20-something male.
I thought you wanted 40-50.

57:13.870 --> 57:16.510
It's not him.
Anything else?

57:16.510 --> 57:17.720
This is all of it.

57:17.720 --> 57:21.370
We looked up all the Kim Sam Gils.

57:22.430 --> 57:25.270
My head hurts.

57:27.670 --> 57:30.650
A package not found in Shipping & Tracking...

57:30.650 --> 57:32.880
A person not found in the Criminal Records...

57:34.090 --> 57:37.570
Why am I always in charge of this kind of stuff?

57:41.240 --> 57:42.870
Did you find anything?

57:44.190 --> 57:49.240
There's no way of finding someone by using one address on a letter.

57:50.410 --> 57:54.690
It's an empty building going through redevelopment.

57:59.190 --> 58:02.050
What would Detective Viper do in this situation?

58:14.840 --> 58:16.860
The third lie...

58:27.430 --> 58:29.500
Secret letter...

58:38.590 --> 58:40.510
Jung Nam Soo...

58:41.700 --> 58:43.280
Kim Sam Gil...

58:47.170 --> 58:49.100
What the hell is going on?

58:56.860 --> 58:59.670
That's Jung Nam Soo's best friend,
who was released a month ago.

59:02.500 --> 59:05.180
The physique looks similar.

59:05.920 --> 59:07.800
But the face is a bit...

59:09.010 --> 59:11.710
As they both endured hard times...

59:11.710 --> 59:14.290
...they developed a strange bond.

59:15.880 --> 59:20.040
Just watch. I'll show you the moves I learned from the Viper.

59:28.040 --> 59:31.390
Ah, hello.
I have something to ask.

59:35.210 --> 59:37.340
I'm here because Nam Soo asked for a favor.

59:38.910 --> 59:39.930
Who?

59:41.590 --> 59:42.740
Nam Soo.

59:42.740 --> 59:44.150
Jung Nam Soo.

59:46.850 --> 59:52.430
He told me to tell Sam Gil something and said to come here.

59:52.430 --> 59:53.770
Are you a cop?

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.350
Here yo go!

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.530
So what happened?

01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:12.820
Has it been 10 years?

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.130
We were playing around and I almost got my ear ripped off.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.600
So, I dug my claws.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.580
He probably got his ass kicked around 10 times.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.820
But, all of a sudden, he stopped responding.

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:29.940
His head popped up.

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.880
And do you know what he said to me?

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.920
I definitely!

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.210
I found a reason to live.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.770
Don't kill me.

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:51.890
Honestly, I was a little scared.

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.990
I guess you guys got close after that.

01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:59.200
Of course.

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:05.190
Do you happen to know a Kim Sam Gil?

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:08.970
Kim Sam Gil?

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.310
Ah, the letter!

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:14.460
His irreplaceable pen pal.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:19.820
He even asked me to send a package to that guy when I got released.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.160
Package?

01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:26.900
Jung Nam Soo asked his cell mate to deliver something when he got released.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.580
Package?

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.440
The recipient is Kim Sam Gil.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.920
We're at the post office trying to see if we can check the contents.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.570
The pistol that Kang Yoon Goo used was a homemade pistol.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:42.850
The master of lathe.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.530
It was Jung Nam Soo's work.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.130
We usually just run basic tests.

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:56.040
But in the even of an emergency,
we run the tests more meticulously.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.240
People go crazy when hazardous materials get delivered.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.200
Since this is a special case,
it should be over here.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.800
February 5...
February 5...

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:12.260
It's here.
See for yourself.

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:18.490
This is-

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:22.960
What?

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:37.340
The last person to leave the crime scene wins.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.440
Director!

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.920
It's not a pistol.
It's feathers.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.800
Did you say revenge?

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:02.490
It's true that there was once a time where that's all I thought about.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:03.500
But...

01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:06.140
I forgot about it all.

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:11.550
After that, I got a large lump of metal.

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.540
The thoughts of wanting to die...

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.190
Whenever I wanted to die,
I started to shave it.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:42.310
With a heavy heart...

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:44.850
I started to make it lighter.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.920
With a heavy heart...

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:52.170
The lightest thing...

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:55.740
Feathers.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.920
Secret note...

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.450
Because of you...

01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:24.370
I was able to forgive-

01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:27.370
No... I was able to forget.

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.940
I send this with gratitude.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:35.980
Knowing that we'll meet soon puts my mind at ease.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.860
I'll be waiting by the sea.

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:41.820
The package and note sent to Kim Sam Gil.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:44.740
Why is this here?

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:46.970
In 1994...

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.160
After failing to commit suicide two times, I received a box of letters.

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:57.800
I didn't respond at first but I started to open my heart little by little.

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:00.980
Kang Yoon Goo...

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:07.030
This person believed I was framed and was the only person...

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.760
...to remember me.

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:13.210
Kim Sam Gil...

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.740
When I got released,
we agreed to go sea fishing.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.300
Because of you...

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.300
I was able to forgive-

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.090
No... I was able to forget.

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:55.770
While pretending to be Kim Sam Gil...

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.050
You received Jung Nam Soo's letters?

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:13.560
Knowing that we'll meet soon puts my mind at ease.

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:16.610
I'll be waiting by the sea.

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:36.890
Is that why you did it?

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.430
3 kinds of lies...

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:01.540
First...

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.420
Turning in a fake criminal lie...

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.470
Second...

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.640
Pretending to be Kim Sam Gil lie...

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.570
Third...

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.890
Pretending not to be a suicide lie...

01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:30.230
Pretending not to be a suicide lie...

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:33.650
Lies... lies...

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:36.850
Lies!

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.160
The Final Class

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.640
Senior Yeo Ji Hoon! I'm on the Funeral Committee for Professor Kang.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.730
The Professor left a keepsake for you.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:16.310
Someone could steal this.
Why didn't he put on a lock?

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:19.140
He said he kept forgetting the password.

01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:21.140
Of course.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.330
Kim Sam Gil had Alzheimer's.

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:46.319
I guess this is the only way to make him into a decent person.

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:49.420
Don't be afraid like me.

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.510
Follow me slowly.

01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:57.870
Then, should I follow along to his last journey?

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:17.980
Are you here to clean your shoes?

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.130
Mister.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:35.930
Yes?

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:38.570
Have you ever heard of a Kim Sam Gil?

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:40.140
Kim Sam Gil...

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.390
Are you here for Professor Kang?

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:49.620
Yes.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.880
I guess you're here because he told you to get your shoes shined here.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.740
You have your loyalty.

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:57.940
When he was young,
his nickname used to be Sam Gil.

01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.670
Always forgetting directions...

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:02.220
All his friends who met up at the intersection...

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:06.160
Always yelled, "Third Road!"

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.930
If he was Sam Gil...

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.350
He should've been Kang Sam Gil, not Kim Sam Gil.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.250
Such a strange man.

01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:22.570
He left something in case someone came to look for it.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:35.170
Is this supposed to go to you?

01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:42.050
I wrapped it up because it seemed important.

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:44.150
Did he say it was lecture material?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.810
How come he doesn't come anymore?

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.810
I'm not sure.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.890
You must not be that great.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:58.180
What?

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.860
This is a present from Professor Kang.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.780
It's my portrait!

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.150
This is really good.

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:33.420
If you're watching this,
you must know by now.

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:35.930
Who's there?

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:37.930
Yeo Ji Hoon is probably there.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:45.600
What do you think I'm about to do right now?

01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:51.610
I'm...

01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:56.820
I'm going to sprinkle my blood here.

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.890
And after I take that book and tear it into 3 parts...

01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:02.630
I'm going to send it to everyone involved.

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:05.830
Then, I'll come back.

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:10.140
And blow my head in the other direction.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.720
Rather than how I'm going to blow my head...

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.620
Why I'm doing it is more important.

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:19.820
This isn't a suicide.

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.220
It's more an execution.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.340
Not guilt.

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:28.760
It's a punishment I deserve for carelessly messing with someone's life.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.930
For Jung Nam Soo...

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:35.690
It's a sincere courtesy to a fellow human being.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.400
Before I forget my sins completely...

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.840
I think about the penalty I am paying for my own sins.

01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:52.490
Often... Who I am...

01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:55.390
Where this fear came from...

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.310
You probably won't understand.

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:05.430
You guys, who I care about deeply.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.490
I'm sorry to you.

01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:12.490
I...

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:16.880
I taught you monster catching skills.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.580
But, I never taught you...

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.110
How to live like a human being.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:32.060
Instead of trying to be a good cop, live a good life.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.140
Instead of talking on and on...

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:39.310
My body can be a final lecture for you guys.

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:42.330
There's no professor,
so this isn't a lecture.

01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:44.930
Should I call this a self learning class?

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.580
I'll miss you guys.

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.470
Do not forgive me.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.790
Ah... Yeo Ji Hoon.

01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:28.900
You probably solved my last problem.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.830
When you touch the dried blood...

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:36.620
The torn skin is recovering...

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.640
And in the bones is where you will find me.

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:52.020
Where are you headed?

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.540
I already told you.

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:58.540
I'm going to meet a friend.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:05.100
If you wish to sue the state,
I'd be glad to help you.

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.340
It might take some time.

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.410
But there's plenty of evidence.

01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:11.000
I...

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.530
I just want to find my friend.

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.240
Did the disease get worse?

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.240
He hasn't contacted.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.940
Do you think he felt guilty?

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.860
Sending letters to Jung Nam Soo.

01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:18.320
I told you once.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.250
Why God gives you the punishment of feeling guilty.

01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:24.070
My teacher...

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:29.280
In order to make that person into a better human being...

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.910
He considered this opportunity as a gift from God.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.110
It'd be better if we don't let Jung Nam Soo know.

01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:42.640
Probably.

01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:48.760
To become Jung Nam Soo's friend...

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.760
He got rid of Kang Yoon Goo.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.040
But it's strange.

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:05.860
The one feeling guilty is me.

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:10.700
I get this feeling that you're avoiding me.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.160
It's Mom.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.540
I don't think I can make it on Saturday.

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:24.830
The funeral isn't over.

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:29.470
Right now? Me?

01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:40.260
I'm meeting with an old friend.

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:47.480
Someone you must meet in the future.

01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:20.850
Thanks to you...

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:23.010
I was able to forgive-

01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:26.860
No, I was able to forget.

01:20:28.330 --> 01:20:31.120
I'm sending this with gratitude.

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:37.190
Tell him to forget.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:43.160
If he can't truly forget...
Even if it's a lie...

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.850
Tell him to forget.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:45.050
Do people like you even feel guilt?

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.430
Subtitles by CJ Entertainment

01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:05.520
<i>The day before the crime,
he called for this person.</i>

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.810
<i>Did you call for someone?</i>

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:10.710
<i>We were able to confirm the face through the photo.</i>

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.170
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:16.640
<i>- It's been a year.
- What do you think you're doing?</i>

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:21.440
<i>The three murders are doubtful,
even though he's a small criminal.</i>

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.210
<i>I caught him in the act.</i>

01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:26.210
<i>But he's saying that I arrested him on false charges.</i>

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:28.210
<i>The beginning was wrong.</i>

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:31.550
<i>The murder was an act of revenge.</i>

01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:33.870
<i>You're still the same, Director Yeo.</i>

01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:37.740
<i>There's too many things you can't figure out in this field.</i>

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.550
<i>So, leave quietly.</i>
