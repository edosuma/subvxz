<i>Jane got a dream job,</i>

<i>Oh, and Jane's father?</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:21.480
<i>Well, he had fallen</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:21.480
<i>for his matchmaker, Darci,</i>

00:26.276 --> 00:28.696

00:37.663 --> 00:39.748
Wow.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.792
<i>But before he knew that,</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:41.792
<i>he'd covered up</i>

00:41.792 --> 00:43.168
<i>his late father's art theft.</i>

00:43.168 --> 00:44.920
<i>So, he came clean</i>

00:43.168 --> 00:44.920
<i>to the police.</i>

00:44.920 --> 00:47.214
<i>And they cut him a deal,</i>

<i>which included jail time.</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:48.799
<i>And at first, Petra was all...</i>

No! I reject your defeat.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.094
<i>But, ultimately,</i>

do you hear me, Mateo?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.448
A very rainy day.

05:23.448 --> 05:27.077
And when I look at you,

05:23.448 --> 05:27.077
it's like I won the lottery,

05:27.077 --> 05:29.788

The lump sum of your love.

That's fine.

that stupid clip?

07:12.057 --> 07:14.101
It's completely out of context.

07:14.101 --> 07:18.563
I had just spilled

07:14.101 --> 07:18.563
hot coffee on myself.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.400
I know, hon. Just be glad

07:18.563 --> 07:21.400
the show is finally ending.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.360
( moans )

07:21.400 --> 07:23.360
Thank God.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.154
It'll be nice to go outside

07:23.360 --> 07:26.154
again without getting harassed.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.449
How dare you mess with Dargelio!

07:29.449 --> 07:31.076
( grunts )

07:29.449 --> 07:31.076
( screams )

07:31.076 --> 07:33.536
On the plus side, you

07:31.076 --> 07:33.536
have gotten a lot

07:33.536 --> 07:35.247
of free publicity for

07:33.536 --> 07:35.247
the new dance studio.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.665
( scoffs )

07:35.247 --> 07:37.665
Free publicity

07:35.247 --> 07:37.665
is not worth being named

07:37.665 --> 07:41.461
one of BuzzFeed's Ten Most

07:37.665 --> 07:41.461
Notorious Reality Show Villains.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.340
Oh, and Rogelio RSVP'd yes,

07:45.340 --> 07:48.385
so we're skipping

07:45.340 --> 07:48.385
the Marbella's grand re-opening.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.511
NARRATOR:

07:48.385 --> 07:50.511
<i>Yep. You heard that right.</i>

07:50.511 --> 07:53.432
<i>Wait'll you see</i>

07:50.511 --> 07:53.432
<i>the brand new Marbella!</i>

07:53.432 --> 07:55.267
<i>That'll put a smile</i>

07:53.432 --> 07:55.267
<i>on your face.</i>

07:55.267 --> 07:57.227
Why is no one smiling?

07:59.438 --> 08:02.107
This is supposed to be the

07:59.438 --> 08:02.107
second happiest place on Earth.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.401
Families are coming here

08:02.107 --> 08:04.401
for luxurious fun.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.527
I don't care if a customer

08:04.401 --> 08:06.527
is stabbing you with a fork.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.988
You keep smiling.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.572
Perfect.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.949
Now get back to work.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.912
( sighs )

08:14.369 --> 08:15.912
Come on, girls.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.914
You're gonna demo

08:15.912 --> 08:17.914
the new pirate treasure hunt.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.500
( keyboard clacking )

08:20.500 --> 08:22.002
NARRATOR:

08:20.500 --> 08:22.002
<i>Wow.</i>

08:22.002 --> 08:23.586
<i>those are some</i>

08:22.002 --> 08:23.586
<i>well-behaved little girls.</i>

08:23.586 --> 08:25.422
<i>I didn't even realize</i>

08:23.586 --> 08:25.422
<i>they were there.</i>

08:25.422 --> 08:26.714
Oh, no.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.759
The little man is gonna behave.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.428
We have a new system.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.428
Don't worry.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.347
Please, Mommy,

08:31.428 --> 08:33.347
let him come.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.849
Ahoy, mateys!

08:33.347 --> 08:35.849
To the beach we go.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.226
Ow!

08:35.849 --> 08:38.226
Mateo!

08:38.226 --> 08:40.228
It's all right.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.228
I know Mateo's just playing.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.190
Take Pammy the Parrot with you.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.400
Aye, Captain.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.400
Now, the most important part

08:45.400 --> 08:48.862
of our treasure hunt is to avoid

08:45.400 --> 08:48.862
our dastardly villain.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.449
Chuck.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.409
NARRATOR:

08:52.449 --> 08:54.409
<i>Ah, yes,</i>

08:54.409 --> 08:57.454
<i>Chuck Chesser.</i>

09:06.171 --> 09:07.464
What are you doing here?

09:07.464 --> 09:09.632
Just wanted a word

09:09.632 --> 09:11.551
about your Critter Cage.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.970
I already told you,

09:11.551 --> 09:13.970
we're not moving the Kids' Club.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.639
Not sure you got a choice,

09:13.970 --> 09:16.639
darlin'.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.639
Petra.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.974
Look, I'm just here to give you

09:17.974 --> 09:20.643
a friendly neighborhood

09:17.974 --> 09:20.643
heads-up.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.645
Heard you got a problem

09:20.643 --> 09:22.645
with your final inspection.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.605
( scoffs )

09:22.645 --> 09:24.605
What?

09:24.605 --> 09:25.648
( chuckles )

09:25.648 --> 09:26.816
No, that can't be right.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.984
INSPECTOR:

09:26.816 --> 09:27.984
<i>He's right.</i>

09:27.984 --> 09:29.777
You have a problem.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.657
The structure's five feet

09:32.780 --> 09:34.657
over the property line,

09:34.657 --> 09:36.951
which means you can't get

09:34.657 --> 09:36.951
your certificate of occupancy

09:36.951 --> 09:38.703
for your Kids' Clubhouse.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.872
Uh, the grand opening

09:38.703 --> 09:40.872
is in five days,

09:40.872 --> 09:42.123
so that's not an option.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.500
Either tear it down

09:43.500 --> 09:44.959
or get an easement

09:43.500 --> 09:44.959
from your neighbor.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.420
NARRATOR:

09:44.959 --> 09:46.420
<i>I'll remind you, friends,</i>

09:46.420 --> 09:48.880
<i>that neighbor</i>

09:46.420 --> 09:48.880
<i>is the scallywag Chuck.</i>

09:48.880 --> 09:50.507
( chuckles )

09:48.880 --> 09:50.507
Just breathe.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.509
Freaking out

09:50.507 --> 09:52.509
isn't gonna help.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.095
NARRATOR:

09:52.509 --> 09:55.095
<i>Look who's staying all calm</i>

09:52.509 --> 09:55.095
<i>in the face of a crisis.</i>

09:55.095 --> 09:56.679
<i>What's that about?</i>

09:56.679 --> 09:58.681
I don't need Zen Rafael

09:56.679 --> 09:58.681
right now, okay?

09:58.681 --> 10:01.351
( scoffs )

09:58.681 --> 10:01.351
Who the hell goes to

09:58.681 --> 10:01.351
prison and comes out softer?

10:01.351 --> 10:03.853
NARRATOR:

10:01.351 --> 10:03.853
<i>It was prison.</i>

10:01.351 --> 10:03.853
<i>He got mellow in prison!</i>

10:03.853 --> 10:05.688
<i>And I knew that.</i>

10:03.853 --> 10:05.688
<i>I was just messing with you.</i>

10:05.688 --> 10:08.900
I'm not trying to be Zen,

10:05.688 --> 10:08.900
just reasonable.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.402
I don't need reasonable!

10:10.402 --> 10:13.405
I need to come up with a plan!

10:13.405 --> 10:14.864
"I," not "we"?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.741
I'm letting her take the lead.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.993
The hotel's succeeding

10:16.741 --> 10:18.993
because of her rebranding idea.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.662
How do you know it's succeeding?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.662
It hasn't even opened yet.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.706
We started taking reservations

10:21.662 --> 10:23.706
last week,

10:23.706 --> 10:27.377
and we are booked solid,

10:23.706 --> 10:27.377
six months out.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.377
Oh, wow.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.003
NARRATOR:

10:27.377 --> 10:29.003
<i>Yeah, that is impressive.</i>

10:29.003 --> 10:30.297
<i>Anyways, Petra's gonna deal</i>

10:30.297 --> 10:32.299
with the whole easement thing,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.299
so...

10:32.299 --> 10:34.259
I'm not gonna stress about it.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.261
Okay, Zen Rafael.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.846
I buy one pair of linen pants...

10:38.846 --> 10:40.974
And grow the world's

10:38.846 --> 10:40.974
worst beard.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.934
Why does everyone

10:40.974 --> 10:42.934
hate the beard?

10:42.934 --> 10:44.603
<i>Except Mateo.</i>

10:44.603 --> 10:45.604
( sighs )

10:45.604 --> 10:47.355
Hey, if I'm nervous

10:47.355 --> 10:49.316
about his parent-teacher

10:47.355 --> 10:49.316
conference tomorrow,

10:49.316 --> 10:51.109
then you must be at a nine.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.694
Closer to a ten... thousand.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.280
<i>Just try to breathe.</i>

10:55.280 --> 10:56.656
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.032
Don't wear linen pants

10:58.032 --> 10:59.576
a-and say good night to Abbey.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.495
Will do.

11:04.623 --> 11:05.999
Jane says good night.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.041
Hmm.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.127
( keyboard clacking )

11:15.175 --> 11:16.384
Is Jane okay?

11:16.384 --> 11:19.387
Yeah. Just nervous.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.139
Hmm.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.142
NARRATOR:

11:21.139 --> 11:24.142
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

11:21.139 --> 11:24.142
<i>The big preschool evaluation.</i>

11:24.142 --> 11:27.437
I am so pleased to tell you

11:24.142 --> 11:27.437
how much sharing,

11:27.437 --> 11:30.064
cooperation, and, well,

11:27.437 --> 11:30.064
all around good behavior

11:30.064 --> 11:31.483
we've been seeing lately.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.943
Not to mention kindness.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.821
NARRATOR:

11:33.943 --> 11:36.821
<i>Wow. Looks like they had</i>

11:33.943 --> 11:36.821
<i>nothing to worry about.</i>

11:36.821 --> 11:40.367
You have every reason

11:36.821 --> 11:40.367
to be so proud

11:40.367 --> 11:42.076
of Ellie and Anna.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.245
Oh, thank you again.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.245
So much, Mrs. Taub.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.704
Oh, no.

11:45.704 --> 11:46.956
Thank you, truly.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.083
They are such a joy.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.670
Oh.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.672
( sighs )

11:53.672 --> 11:55.256
Good luck.

11:57.509 --> 12:02.305
Mateo definitely has

11:57.509 --> 12:02.305
a very sweet side.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.892
But he also has some

12:02.305 --> 12:05.892
impulse control issues,

12:05.892 --> 12:07.561
which, I know, we discussed

12:07.561 --> 12:09.187
when we admitted him

12:07.561 --> 12:09.187
a few months ago.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.064
NARRATOR:

12:09.187 --> 12:11.064
<i>Right. Jane and Rafael decided</i>

12:11.064 --> 12:13.400
<i>he needed more structure</i>

12:11.064 --> 12:13.400
<i>after the terrible twos</i>

12:13.400 --> 12:15.235
<i>stretched to</i>

12:13.400 --> 12:15.235
<i>the friggin' fours.</i>

12:15.235 --> 12:17.571
We know that adjusting to a new

12:15.235 --> 12:17.571
school can be difficult.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.197
And we empathize.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.781
Thank you so much.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.576
But his behavior's

12:20.781 --> 12:22.576
disrupting class,

12:22.576 --> 12:24.160
so we would like you

12:22.576 --> 12:24.160
to get him an aide.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.662
Excuse me?

12:25.662 --> 12:27.746
A shadow.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.746
To follow him around

12:27.746 --> 12:29.583
and help him, and us,

12:27.746 --> 12:29.583
when he acts up.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.751
I know, it's

12:29.583 --> 12:32.751
hard to hear,

12:32.751 --> 12:35.963
but we have enlisted the help

12:32.751 --> 12:35.963
of aides for other children

12:35.963 --> 12:38.383
with behavioral issues,

12:35.963 --> 12:38.383
and we've had great results.

12:38.383 --> 12:42.345
It just feels so drastic.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.013
Do you really think

12:42.345 --> 12:44.013
that's necessary?

12:44.013 --> 12:46.725
If he wants to stay at

12:44.013 --> 12:46.725
the school, then yes.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.893
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

12:52.439 --> 12:54.482
Good. This is good.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.359
She gave us two weeks

12:54.482 --> 12:56.359
to whip him into shape.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.319
NARRATOR:

12:56.359 --> 12:58.319
<i>Translation: Jane begged.</i>

12:58.319 --> 12:59.946
We can do it.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.946
Hmm.

12:59.946 --> 13:03.575
An aide is just...

12:59.946 --> 13:03.575
too extreme.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.159
And, of course,

13:03.575 --> 13:05.159
it goes without saying...

13:05.159 --> 13:06.911
NARRATOR:

13:05.159 --> 13:06.911
<i>But here she is saying it.</i>

13:06.911 --> 13:09.080
Please, don't tell...

13:06.911 --> 13:09.080
Hello, hello.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.582
NARRATOR:

13:09.080 --> 13:10.582
<i>Yep. That's right.</i>

13:10.582 --> 13:12.500
<i>Petra is the queen</i>

13:10.582 --> 13:12.500
<i>of The Marbella</i>

13:12.500 --> 13:14.294
<i>and queen of the preschool.</i>

13:14.294 --> 13:15.836
How was the conference?

13:15.836 --> 13:17.004
Great.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.004
It went well.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.797
Oh. Whew. Good.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.883
I have to say I feel

13:18.797 --> 13:20.883
a little bit responsible,

13:20.883 --> 13:22.927
since I pulled all those strings

13:20.883 --> 13:22.927
to get Mateo in.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.555
Which, again,

13:22.927 --> 13:25.555
we really appreciate.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.641
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.641
( laughing ): Hey.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.726
Mateo, the girls were just about

13:27.641 --> 13:29.726
to have a snack.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.311
Would you like some

13:29.726 --> 13:31.311
mini carrots, too?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.646
Mateo, say thank you.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.690
Carrots... yuk.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.690
( gasps )

13:35.690 --> 13:38.192
Mateo. We don't throw.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.988
Hey. You stop that right now.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.988
That is unacceptable behavior.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.407
Petra. We talked about this.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.407
Please don't discipline my son.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.617
Well, someone has to.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.867
( clears throat )

13:46.867 --> 13:48.077
Okay. I should go.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.456
Okay. Uh, we'll

13:48.077 --> 13:51.456
see you later.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.456
Hmm?

13:51.456 --> 13:53.124
We're taking the

13:51.456 --> 13:53.124
twins to ice cream

13:53.124 --> 13:55.042

13:53.124 --> 13:55.042

13:55.042 --> 13:56.877

13:58.463 --> 14:00.839
Great. So happy for them.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.091
Good job, girls.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.468
Thank you, Auntie Jane.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.594
We'll share with Mateo.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.595
Awesome.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.496
The first round of edits,

14:28.284 --> 14:31.496
not the second.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.544
Fine. So one of the writers

14:34.582 --> 14:37.544
dropped out

14:37.544 --> 14:39.462
of Miami's Ones to Read.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.422
Really?

14:41.422 --> 14:43.049
Uh, so-so there's an open slot?

14:43.049 --> 14:45.926
Yes. Let me know which ones

14:43.049 --> 14:45.926
I should bother to read

14:45.926 --> 14:47.928
and which would make me

14:45.926 --> 14:47.928
gouge my eyes out.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.730
So I'm gonna submit my novel.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.784
I've read it.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.784
She will.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.244
( in English ):Agreed.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.244
( door opens )

15:11.244 --> 15:12.829
Hi, all.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.372
Hey, what are you doing here?

15:14.372 --> 15:15.749
They invited me.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.375
What are you doing here?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.420
( in Spanish ):

15:19.168 --> 15:20.420
You're both here,

15:20.420 --> 15:23.548
because this

15:20.420 --> 15:23.548
has gone on too long.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.759
( in English ):

15:23.548 --> 15:25.759
Beyond the fact that

15:23.548 --> 15:25.759
we love you both,

15:25.759 --> 15:27.218
do you know what

15:25.759 --> 15:27.218
a giant pain

15:27.218 --> 15:29.888
in the ass it is to have

15:27.218 --> 15:29.888
you two not speaking?

15:29.888 --> 15:31.556
Scheduling separate

15:29.888 --> 15:31.556
dinners every week.

15:31.556 --> 15:35.059

15:36.644 --> 15:38.229
( in Spanish ):

15:36.644 --> 15:38.229
It's time to make up.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.773
For the sake of this family

15:39.773 --> 15:41.608
Nope. No way.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.608
Not happening.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.817
( scoffs )

15:44.444 --> 15:47.029
That's one.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.029
What was that?

15:47.029 --> 15:48.322
Oh, come on.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.990
If you two are gonna

15:48.322 --> 15:49.990
act like children,

15:49.990 --> 15:52.243
then we're gonna treat you

15:49.990 --> 15:52.243
like children. Go. Make up.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.123
That's two.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.881
As I have told you

16:01.294 --> 16:04.881
1,000 times before,

16:04.881 --> 16:08.259
I am very, very sorry about

16:04.881 --> 16:08.259
the way you were portrayed

16:08.259 --> 16:09.761
on the De Le Vega-Factor Factor,

16:09.761 --> 16:10.887
but I didn't know.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.430
And I had no say in it.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.681
You're a producer.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.141
Everybody that works

16:13.681 --> 16:15.141
in television

16:15.141 --> 16:16.851
is a producer.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.647
( bowling pins falling )

16:20.647 --> 16:22.398
You knew they were gonna

16:20.647 --> 16:22.398
portray me like that.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.275
I didn't.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.275
You did.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.985
NARRATOR:

16:24.275 --> 16:25.985
<i>This is nose-diving fast.</i>

16:25.985 --> 16:28.613
So I don't know what else

16:25.985 --> 16:28.613
to say to convince you.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.949
But the bottom line

16:28.613 --> 16:30.949
is that the show is over.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.746
So please, can we

16:32.742 --> 16:36.746
just put it behind us?

16:37.914 --> 16:39.540
I've missed you.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.380
Yes.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.925
Okay, let's try.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.348
"And Olivia gives her

16:52.929 --> 16:55.348
a kiss back and says,

16:55.348 --> 16:57.976
'I love you anyway, too.'"

16:59.477 --> 17:01.145
Mommy?

17:01.145 --> 17:03.105
Yes, Mr. Sweetface.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.608
I'm sorry I'm a bad boy.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.237
Mateo, you are not a bad boy.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.489
Don't ever say that.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.574
You are a good boy...

17:13.574 --> 17:15.702
who does things

17:13.574 --> 17:15.702
he shouldn't do sometimes.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.954
But everyone does things

17:15.702 --> 17:17.954
they shouldn't do sometimes.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.748
Like Olivia in the story

17:20.748 --> 17:22.667
when she painted on the walls?

17:22.667 --> 17:23.751
Yeah.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.003
She should have asked her mommy

17:25.003 --> 17:26.212
and used her words.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.131
I try to remember

17:26.212 --> 17:29.131
to use my words,

17:29.131 --> 17:31.258
but sometimes I just forget.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.344
I know.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.054
I love you, Mommy.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.307
I love you, too, Mateo.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.142
Oh.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.142
You're the best

17:40.142 --> 17:42.020
mommy in the world.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.076
<i>Some things never change.</i>

17:57.076 --> 17:58.619
Okay. Time's up.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.162
NARRATOR:

17:58.619 --> 18:00.162
<i>But some things do.</i>

18:00.162 --> 18:02.832
Okay. My plan is to track

18:00.162 --> 18:02.832
Mateo's meltdowns

18:02.832 --> 18:04.417
for a week to see if

18:02.832 --> 18:04.417
there any triggers

18:04.417 --> 18:05.710
to get to the root

18:04.417 --> 18:05.710
of the problem.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.588
Okay.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.588
My plan is martial arts.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.298
Did you get that plan

18:08.588 --> 18:11.298
from Petra?

18:13.051 --> 18:15.803
No. It's from me.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.847
I like what Ellie and Anna

18:15.803 --> 18:17.847
get from it.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.974
And research says that it

18:17.847 --> 18:19.974
teaches discipline

18:19.974 --> 18:22.977
and that it's really great for

18:19.974 --> 18:22.977
overactive kids like Mateo.

18:22.977 --> 18:26.105
Okay. So we have

18:22.977 --> 18:26.105
a two-pronged plan.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.025
Track his meltdowns

18:26.105 --> 18:29.025
and martial arts.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.237

18:33.237 --> 18:35.740

18:39.786 --> 18:41.495
I need your signature

18:39.786 --> 18:41.495

18:41.495 --> 18:44.040
Ooh. No can do.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.166
You know how I feel

18:44.040 --> 18:46.166
about that kids club.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.210
Screeching rodents are

18:46.166 --> 18:48.210
gonna kill the sensual vibe

18:48.210 --> 18:49.963
of my adults-only pool.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.465
Move that little brat bin to

18:49.963 --> 18:52.465
the other side of your property.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.216
That's ridiculous;

18:52.465 --> 18:54.216
you know the tides there

18:54.216 --> 18:55.593
are way too

18:54.216 --> 18:55.593
dangerous for kids.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.303
On the other hand,

18:55.593 --> 18:57.303
overpopulation

18:57.303 --> 19:00.056
is a major concern.

19:00.056 --> 19:03.225
Look. I'm a reasonable person,

19:00.056 --> 19:03.225
so how about this?

19:03.225 --> 19:04.894
We split the cost

19:03.225 --> 19:04.894
of moving your pool.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.939
( laughs )

19:04.894 --> 19:07.939
Shut down my pool

19:04.894 --> 19:07.939

19:07.939 --> 19:09.107
You couldn't pay me enough.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.441
Well, I'm not moving

19:09.107 --> 19:10.441
my clubhouse.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.818
Great. Then I'm gonna

19:10.441 --> 19:11.818
tear it down.

19:11.818 --> 19:12.944
Oh, we'll see about that.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.862

20:32.648 --> 20:35.609
PETRA:

20:32.648 --> 20:35.609
<i>I'm ready for a fight.</i>

20:35.609 --> 20:37.611
And I am more than

20:35.609 --> 20:37.611
willing to play dirty.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.905
Tell me more.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.198
I did a little research.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.782
Turns out those lobsters

20:40.198 --> 20:41.782
you love so much?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.743
The ones that have been on

20:41.782 --> 20:43.743
your hotel's secret menu

20:43.743 --> 20:46.120
for the past month?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.120
Mmm. Granny-slapping good.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.997
Whatever that means.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.583
They're also illegal.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.710
It's off-season for the

20:50.583 --> 20:52.710
spiny lobster in Florida.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.462
And each poaching violation

20:52.710 --> 20:55.462
can get you up to six months

20:55.462 --> 20:57.715
in jail, plus your fishing

20:55.462 --> 20:57.715
boat can get impounded.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.926
NARRATOR:

20:57.715 --> 20:59.926
<i>Uh-oh. Petra's lobster claws</i>

20:57.715 --> 20:59.926
<i>are coming out.</i>

20:59.926 --> 21:02.636
Really?

20:59.926 --> 21:02.636
And if you don't sign

20:59.926 --> 21:02.636
this easement,

21:02.636 --> 21:04.097
I will turn you in.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.557
So, as our wildlife

21:04.097 --> 21:06.557
commissioner says...

21:09.351 --> 21:12.188
( laughs ):

21:09.351 --> 21:12.188
Wow. Now you're

21:09.351 --> 21:12.188
gonna quote Uncle Bobby?

21:12.188 --> 21:13.606
What?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.608
Florida wildlife commissioner's

21:13.606 --> 21:15.608
my Uncle Bobby.

21:15.608 --> 21:19.486
And I'll clear up any violations

21:15.608 --> 21:19.486
when I see him at poker night.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.905
Thanks, though.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.161
Okay. Good.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.955
Okay, this is good.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.955
She just tweeted

21:28.955 --> 21:30.873
that her green tea latte

21:28.955 --> 21:30.873
is #LiquidZen.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.250
And Lena Dunham

21:32.250 --> 21:35.711
just faved it. Go. Go.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.711
Okay. I'm going.

21:35.711 --> 21:39.132
Don't be scared,

21:35.711 --> 21:39.132
but don't be too confident.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.008
NARRATOR:

21:39.132 --> 21:41.008
<i>Remember, Jane,</i>

21:39.132 --> 21:41.008

21:41.008 --> 21:43.302
<i>as you choose to be.</i>

21:43.302 --> 21:44.470
( knocks lightly )

21:44.470 --> 21:45.930
What?

21:46.931 --> 21:48.641
Well...

21:48.641 --> 21:51.185
I've never asked you

21:48.641 --> 21:51.185
for... anything,

21:51.185 --> 21:53.604
uh, but, well...

21:53.604 --> 21:55.731
sometimes in life,

21:55.731 --> 21:58.651
certain opportunities

21:55.731 --> 21:58.651
come up and you have

21:58.651 --> 22:00.694
to go after those things,

21:58.651 --> 22:00.694
and I think this might be

22:00.694 --> 22:03.281
one of those times.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.281
Just give me the logline.

22:03.281 --> 22:04.865
Will you read my work

22:03.281 --> 22:04.865
and consider me

22:04.865 --> 22:06.366
for the seventh showcase slot?

22:06.366 --> 22:07.910
Sure.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.496
Anything else?

22:10.496 --> 22:12.290
No.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.374
Thank you.

NARRATOR:

22:14.374 --> 22:16.210
<i>Strong move, Jane!</i>

22:16.210 --> 22:17.837
<i>Hi-yah!</i>

22:17.837 --> 22:20.923
The strength of your love

22:17.837 --> 22:20.923
nourishes my body...

22:20.923 --> 22:23.092
and my soul, Rogelio.

22:26.344 --> 22:27.554
DIRECTOR:

22:26.344 --> 22:27.554
And cut!

22:27.554 --> 22:29.098
Why won't you

22:27.554 --> 22:29.098
even consider it?

22:29.098 --> 22:31.017
Because I want

22:29.098 --> 22:31.017
the show over.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.936
And we get how you feel,

22:31.017 --> 22:33.936
Rogelio, we really do,

22:33.936 --> 22:35.521
but, uh,

22:33.936 --> 22:35.521
the ratings keep rising.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.773
Then get another gorgeous

22:35.521 --> 22:37.773
fool to play her husband.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.650
Because there's no way

22:37.773 --> 22:39.650
in a million, gazillion,

22:39.650 --> 22:40.818
trillion years...

22:40.818 --> 22:42.611
Trillion is less

22:40.818 --> 22:42.611
than a gazillion.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.404
What?

22:42.611 --> 22:44.404
If you're building,

22:44.404 --> 22:46.573
it's million, trillion...

22:44.404 --> 22:46.573
You see, this is why...

22:46.573 --> 22:48.242
gazillion!

22:46.573 --> 22:48.242
this is why I don't

22:46.573 --> 22:48.242
want to do it!

22:48.242 --> 22:50.161
Everybody

22:48.242 --> 22:50.161
just calm down, okay?

22:50.161 --> 22:53.455
Rogelio, just answer me

22:50.161 --> 22:53.455
one question, okay?

22:50.161 --> 22:53.455
Hmm?

22:53.455 --> 22:55.166
Would this change your mind?

22:55.166 --> 22:57.668
NARRATOR:

22:55.166 --> 22:57.668
<i>Ah, yes--</i>

22:55.166 --> 22:57.668

22:57.668 --> 22:59.962

22:59.962 --> 23:02.548
<i>a passion project of Rogelio's.</i>

23:02.548 --> 23:04.967
You have six months

23:02.548 --> 23:04.967
to get famous enough

23:04.967 --> 23:06.384
to star in the

23:04.967 --> 23:06.384
American version,

23:06.384 --> 23:09.096
or you have to go beg

23:06.384 --> 23:09.096
Rob Lowe to come back.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.473
The network is prepared

23:09.096 --> 23:11.473

23:16.103 --> 23:18.022
of<i> The De La Vega-Factor Factor.</i>

23:18.981 --> 23:20.649
Let's do it.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.693
This country needs

23:20.649 --> 23:22.693
a Latino president,

23:22.693 --> 23:25.154
and you're just the man

23:22.693 --> 23:25.154
to play one on TV.

23:30.408 --> 23:32.494
And if she likes my book,

23:30.408 --> 23:32.494
I mean...

23:32.494 --> 23:34.412
I don't even want

23:32.494 --> 23:34.412
to think about it.

23:34.412 --> 23:35.956
She's gonna love it.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.541
Trust me. I've read it.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.461
You okay?

23:41.461 --> 23:43.547
Yeah. Yeah, it's just...

23:43.547 --> 23:45.883
I don't get how everyone made

23:43.547 --> 23:45.883
such a big mistake

23:45.883 --> 23:47.634
with the construction plans.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.846
I mean, no one noticed they

23:47.634 --> 23:50.846
were going five feet over?

23:50.846 --> 23:52.514
It doesn't make sense.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.101
What?

23:55.101 --> 23:56.643
You're engaging a little.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.145
Oh, don't make it a thing.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.231
Oh, it's definitely a thing.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.231
MATEO: Mommy!

24:00.231 --> 24:01.899
Daddy!

24:00.231 --> 24:01.899
BOTH: Aw...

24:01.899 --> 24:03.483
What's wrong, sweetie?

24:03.483 --> 24:04.693
Jackson's having

24:04.693 --> 24:06.070
his birthday party,

24:06.070 --> 24:08.697
and everyone's invited but me.

24:08.697 --> 24:13.202
Aw.

24:08.697 --> 24:13.202
Honey, I'm sure

24:08.697 --> 24:13.202
it's a misunderstanding.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.707
Hey. So, this is awkward, uh,

24:18.707 --> 24:21.043
but Mateo didn't get an invite

24:18.707 --> 24:21.043
to Jackson's party.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.920
And I'm sure it's

24:21.043 --> 24:22.920
just 'cause he's new, so...

24:22.920 --> 24:25.172
No, it's because

24:22.920 --> 24:25.172
he hit Jackson last week.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.926
And we wrote an apology card.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.429
And he's in martial arts,

24:28.926 --> 24:31.429
so that's helping.

24:31.429 --> 24:33.180
I'm sorry, we can't have

24:31.429 --> 24:33.180
that sort of behavior

24:33.180 --> 24:35.473
at Jackson's party.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.473
Look, I'm sure this school

24:35.473 --> 24:37.810
has a policy

24:35.473 --> 24:37.810
about inviting all the kids.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.062
We actually don't.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.062
Well, that's crazy.

24:40.062 --> 24:41.230
Take it up with the PTA.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.023
NARRATOR:

24:41.230 --> 24:43.023
<i>And, of course,</i>

24:43.023 --> 24:45.151
<i>the president of said PTA is...</i>

24:45.151 --> 24:46.944
Petra.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.487
Yeah, Astrid told me

24:46.944 --> 24:49.487
about the birthday.

24:49.487 --> 24:51.573
And look,

24:49.487 --> 24:51.573
Jane does not want my pity.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.992
Or help.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.618
She's made that very clear

24:52.992 --> 24:54.618
over the years.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.578
You're wrong, and you're

24:54.618 --> 24:56.578
getting Mateo invited.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.331
But that is not why I'm here.

24:58.331 --> 25:01.083
I went back

24:58.331 --> 25:01.083
to the original plans...

25:01.083 --> 25:02.376
and look-- right there.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.837
That 8 used to be a 3.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.465
Someone tampered with it

25:04.837 --> 25:07.465
so we'd build the kids' club

25:07.465 --> 25:09.591
over the property line

25:07.465 --> 25:09.591
and have to take it down.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.177
Who would do that?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.429
And how would they gain

25:11.177 --> 25:13.429
access to the blueprints?

25:13.429 --> 25:15.931
Uh, there are

25:13.429 --> 25:15.931
some greasy fingerprints

25:15.931 --> 25:17.308
along the edges.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.687

<i>Wait.</i>

25:26.859 --> 25:28.152
You and Chuck?

25:28.152 --> 25:30.904
Stop. It's embarrassing

25:28.152 --> 25:30.904
enough, okay?

25:32.072 --> 25:33.491
It's just with all the stress

25:33.491 --> 25:35.784
of remodeling

25:33.491 --> 25:35.784
and opening the Marbella...

25:35.784 --> 25:38.204
hate sex with him

25:35.784 --> 25:38.204
was my only escape.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.456
Well, that's not as bad

25:40.456 --> 25:42.291
as when I thought

25:40.456 --> 25:42.291
you were sleeping with Scott.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.584
( groans )

25:42.291 --> 25:44.584
Don't remind me.

25:44.584 --> 25:47.213
Hey, whatever happened

25:44.584 --> 25:47.213
to that guy anyway?

NARRATOR:

25:47.213 --> 25:48.881

25:48.881 --> 25:50.841

25:50.841 --> 25:53.010
I am done with you!

25:50.841 --> 25:53.010
You are fired!

25:53.010 --> 25:54.136
You can't fire me.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.679
What the hell

25:54.136 --> 25:55.679
is that?

25:55.679 --> 25:56.722
That's the amendment

25:56.722 --> 25:58.057
to Emilio Solano's will.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.059
You burn me,

25:58.057 --> 26:00.059
I burn you.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.935
Who knows?

26:01.935 --> 26:04.480
After he and Anezka split,

26:01.935 --> 26:04.480
he moved away.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.148
Look, this is my mistake.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.733
I'll fix it.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.985
NARRATOR:

26:07.733 --> 26:09.985
<i>And speaking</i>

26:07.733 --> 26:09.985

26:09.985 --> 26:12.238
Well, it's a good thing

26:09.985 --> 26:12.238
that Jackson's mom

26:12.238 --> 26:14.740
found your invitation.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.740
And her manners.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.034
But listen to me,

26:14.740 --> 26:17.034
it is very important

26:17.034 --> 26:19.661
that you are on your

26:17.034 --> 26:19.661
tippy-top best behavior.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.497

Ugh. Work.

26:27.503 --> 26:28.921
Oh, my God.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.257
Was your boss mean again?

26:31.257 --> 26:34.134
No. Mateo,

26:31.257 --> 26:34.134
she was really nice.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.887
She... she just picked Mommy's

26:34.134 --> 26:36.887
book for a special reading!

26:36.887 --> 26:39.473
Yay, Mommy!

26:39.473 --> 26:40.516
Yay, Mateo!

26:40.516 --> 26:42.101

26:46.313 --> 26:48.982
<i>Which brings us here. Now.</i>

26:48.982 --> 26:50.692
Uh, gentle, okay?

26:52.403 --> 26:54.363
Good boy.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.501
Hey, I got him, I got him.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.501
Uh, keep him away

27:07.501 --> 27:09.336
from sugar--

27:07.501 --> 27:09.336
he can't handle it.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.880
You know, I really wish you'd

27:09.336 --> 27:11.880
keep your opinions to yourself.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.174
N-Nothing ever stops you

27:11.880 --> 27:14.174
from giving yours.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.510
Well, I don't make critical

27:14.174 --> 27:16.510
remarks about your kids.

27:16.510 --> 27:19.388
ASTRID:

27:16.510 --> 27:19.388
All right,

27:16.510 --> 27:19.388
everyone gather around for cake!

27:19.388 --> 27:20.931
Yes, that's because

27:19.388 --> 27:20.931
my kids behave.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.767
My son's behavior is

27:20.931 --> 27:23.767
none of your business.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.852
Of course it's my business--

27:23.767 --> 27:25.852
I'm the reason you're here.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.230
What? Rafael.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.230
MATEO: Cake!

27:28.230 --> 27:30.232
Did you ask Petra for help?

27:30.232 --> 27:32.067
Yes, I did.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.652
Because he's my son,

27:32.067 --> 27:34.652
and I wanted him here.

27:34.652 --> 27:36.447
You should have told me.

27:34.652 --> 27:36.447
You would have said no.

27:36.447 --> 27:38.491
Exactly!

27:36.447 --> 27:38.491
Because we don't need pity.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.825
Hi-yah!

27:39.825 --> 27:41.577

27:51.170 --> 27:53.755
Hon, put it out of your head.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.048
You apologized.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.926
Now, come on.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.926
This is your night.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.435

28:08.145 --> 28:10.730
Be right back.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.232
Professor Donaldson.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.151
Hi. Thanks for coming.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.611
Well, I was in the area.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.695
Yeah, right.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.695
You're my mentor, okay?

28:17.695 --> 28:18.822
So stop acting like you're not.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.492
Well... you know

28:18.822 --> 28:21.492
I love this book.

28:21.492 --> 28:23.160
So...

28:23.160 --> 28:25.745
( sighs )

28:23.160 --> 28:25.745
Thanks for pushing me

28:23.160 --> 28:25.745
to write it.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.543
Big night.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.628
( exhales )

28:32.628 --> 28:35.548
Xo? What is it?

28:35.548 --> 28:39.468
Your fake wife tweeted

28:35.548 --> 28:39.468
about the third season.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.303
( sighs )

28:41.303 --> 28:44.390
Well, it's not true.

28:41.303 --> 28:44.390
She's trying to pressure me.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.016
What?

28:46.016 --> 28:47.934
The network offered

28:47.934 --> 28:49.603
to green-light

28:47.934 --> 28:49.603
<i>The Passions of Steve</i>

28:49.603 --> 28:51.564
in exchange for

28:49.603 --> 28:51.564
another season.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.315
But I turned them down.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.609
It's not worth it.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.944
I won't put you through

28:55.609 --> 28:57.944
another year of that.

28:59.655 --> 29:01.323
Can everyone

28:59.655 --> 29:01.323
please find a seat?

29:01.323 --> 29:04.743
All right, I'm here.

29:01.323 --> 29:04.743
How can I help you, darlin'?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.286
By telling the truth.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.414
( chuckles ): What?

29:06.286 --> 29:08.414
I know you did this.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.333
Did what?

29:08.414 --> 29:11.333
Altered the blueprints.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.835
And I won't hesitate

29:11.333 --> 29:13.835
to call the cops

29:13.835 --> 29:15.504
unless you sign this easement.

29:15.504 --> 29:16.755
Petra, I did not do that.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.383
I know you did.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.383
And I staked everything

29:19.383 --> 29:21.009
on this renovation. Everything.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.678
Not just my reputation.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.678
It's my vision.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.846
It's my gift to my daughters.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.846
It's mine.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.557
It's the first

29:24.846 --> 29:26.557
thing, actually,

29:26.557 --> 29:28.267
that's truly mine--

29:26.557 --> 29:28.267
I didn't marry it,

29:28.267 --> 29:29.685
I didn't steal it, I made it--

29:29.685 --> 29:31.520
and now you're trying

29:29.685 --> 29:31.520
to take it all away.

(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

29:42.573 --> 29:43.699
I knew it.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.619
Now, get out of here.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.954
Almost done.

I-I can't stand there

Or maybe that I should.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.529
But I can't.

31:11.077 --> 31:13.706
You're giving

31:11.077 --> 31:13.706

34:56.553 --> 34:59.097
Mateo needs a shadow.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.016
He acts out,

35:01.016 --> 35:02.809
he has impulse control

35:01.016 --> 35:02.809
issues,

35:02.809 --> 35:05.144
and we need to accept that

35:02.809 --> 35:05.144
and get him help and support,

35:05.144 --> 35:07.146
which, luckily,

35:05.144 --> 35:07.146
we can afford.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.191
You're right.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.361
( in Spanish ):

35:10.191 --> 35:13.361
I think it's a very good idea.

35:13.361 --> 35:16.155
( both chuckle )

35:16.155 --> 35:20.660
<i>Mi amor.</i>

35:16.155 --> 35:20.660
Good night.

35:20.660 --> 35:25.040

35:20.660 --> 35:25.040
How long are you gonna keep

35:20.660 --> 35:25.040
tucking me in, hmm?

35:25.040 --> 35:28.835
( in Spanish ):

35:25.040 --> 35:28.835
As long as

35:25.040 --> 35:28.835

35:46.728 --> 35:49.147
<i>I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

35:49.147 --> 35:51.817
<i>I'll be home in ten minutes.</i>

35:49.147 --> 35:51.817
<i>I stopped to buy an orange.</i>

35:51.817 --> 35:53.526
<i>O-Okay, a dozen oranges.</i>

35:53.526 --> 35:55.654

35:53.526 --> 35:55.654
<i>about buying street fruit,</i>

35:55.654 --> 35:58.865
<i>so I'm just preparing you</i>

35:55.654 --> 35:58.865

35:58.865 --> 36:01.076

36:31.690 --> 36:33.817
Thank you.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.443
You're the reason

36:33.817 --> 36:35.443
this wasn't a disaster.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.864
Just supporting.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.864
This is all you.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.824
Still not ready to

36:38.864 --> 36:40.824
step back in full-time?

36:40.824 --> 36:42.742
No. No, not yet.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.661
I tell him

36:42.742 --> 36:44.661
all the time he should.

NARRATOR:

36:44.661 --> 36:46.371

<i>Abbey.</i>

36:48.206 --> 36:50.208
<i>Which maybe is significant.</i>

36:50.208 --> 36:51.710
<i>But that's for another day.</i>

36:55.505 --> 36:56.798
What the hell?

37:07.350 --> 37:09.435
We broke ground on the...

37:07.350 --> 37:09.435
on the clubhouse

37:09.435 --> 37:11.104
eight months ago, right?

37:11.104 --> 37:13.023
Yeah. Why?

37:13.023 --> 37:15.067
Well, the timeline

37:13.023 --> 37:15.067
doesn't add up.

37:15.067 --> 37:18.486
I started sleeping with

37:15.067 --> 37:18.486
Chuck six months ago.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.655
He couldn't have changed

37:18.486 --> 37:20.655
the blueprints.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.949
You didn't do it.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.702
Like I told you.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.120
Why did you sign the easement?

37:28.287 --> 37:30.582
I think you know why, Petra.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.461
Well, thank you.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.590
And I'm sorry

37:38.590 --> 37:41.218
about all the mean things

37:38.590 --> 37:41.218
I said.

37:41.218 --> 37:42.635
And thought.

37:42.635 --> 37:43.887
Mm-hmm.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.931
I assume the fact

37:45.931 --> 37:47.306
that your hand is now on my ass

37:47.306 --> 37:49.101
is your way

37:47.306 --> 37:49.101
of saying you accept my apology?

37:51.519 --> 37:53.521
Let's make it quick.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.521
I got plans early tomorrow.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.940

37:54.940 --> 37:59.069

37:59.069 --> 38:00.361
( cheering )

38:00.361 --> 38:03.198
I, Swashbuckling Shawn,

38:00.361 --> 38:03.198
must confess,

38:03.198 --> 38:05.617
I've buried some treasure

38:03.198 --> 38:05.617
at this address.

38:05.617 --> 38:09.412
I need your helping hand finding

38:05.617 --> 38:09.412
my loot on this here land.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.414
Look until the sky is starry.

38:11.414 --> 38:14.167
Yo ho ho, you won't be sorry.

( cheering )

38:14.167 --> 38:16.169
JANE:<i> I'm sorry.</i>

38:17.545 --> 38:19.839
I didn't ask for your help

38:17.545 --> 38:19.839
with Mateo because...

38:22.175 --> 38:25.553
Well, it made me feel

38:22.175 --> 38:25.553
like I failed him as a parent.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.555
Like I let my sadness

38:25.553 --> 38:27.555
get in the way,

38:27.555 --> 38:29.432
and that's why he's acting out.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.935
Yeah, no kidding. And I've been

38:29.432 --> 38:31.935
waiting to tell you

38:31.935 --> 38:33.895
that's just

38:31.935 --> 38:33.895
completely ridiculous.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.649
Look, I don't know

38:35.188 --> 38:37.649
how you did it,

38:37.649 --> 38:39.442
but you have been

38:37.649 --> 38:39.442
an incredible mother.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.486
And I know.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.905
I've seen you once a week

38:47.867 --> 38:49.911

38:49.911 --> 38:51.871
I promise.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.792
Trust me, I worry

38:53.414 --> 38:55.792
about that, too.

38:55.792 --> 38:56.918
( scoffs )

38:56.918 --> 38:58.086
( sighs )

38:58.086 --> 39:00.588
I do.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.382
So let's check in

39:00.588 --> 39:03.382
on each other, okay?

39:03.382 --> 39:04.968
Once a week. We'll get

39:03.382 --> 39:04.968
the kids together,

39:04.968 --> 39:07.012
because they're siblings,

39:04.968 --> 39:07.012
and we'll just make sure

39:07.012 --> 39:08.263
that everything's okay.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.348
You don't have to do this.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.767
I don't like

39:10.348 --> 39:12.767
to be pitied, okay?

39:12.767 --> 39:14.227
Are you serious?

39:15.478 --> 39:17.856
Don't make me pull

39:15.478 --> 39:17.856
the widow card.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.691
I need this, too, okay?

39:21.776 --> 39:24.403
And then, the rest of the week,

39:21.776 --> 39:24.403
we'll never speak of it.

39:24.403 --> 39:27.324
Fine.

39:24.403 --> 39:27.324

Hmm. I can't see far,

I can't see yonder.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.738
What might be blockin'

this, I wonder.
