WEBVTT

00:05.280 --> 00:07.080
Are you OK, Rash?

00:08.160 --> 00:09.830
What happened?

00:10.520 --> 00:12.060
We crashed.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.670
Jesus.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.920
Are you hurt?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.230
We're upside down.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.680
Yep.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.910
There's something dripping down my back.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.390
What's dripping down my back?

00:37.440 --> 00:38.830
It's petrol.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.020
- What?!
- It's petrol!

00:41.920 --> 00:45.720
- Well, I think we should get out!
- Yeah, definitely.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.510
How... could this... get any worse?

00:59.240 --> 01:01.190
They're coming back!

01:01.240 --> 01:02.640
Get out!

01:03.440 --> 01:04.470
I can't!

01:04.519 --> 01:06.030
Rash, get out!

01:06.080 --> 01:07.270
My seatbelt! I can't!

01:07.320 --> 01:10.000
Rash! Get out!

01:11.160 --> 01:12.560
Get out!

01:13.520 --> 01:14.750
Wiggle it!

01:14.800 --> 01:17.270
I have wiggled it, it's stuck!

01:21.440 --> 01:23.240
What's he doing?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.160 --> 02:08.560
Come on!

02:10.960 --> 02:13.310
I told you, I can't move, I'm stuck!

02:13.360 --> 02:14.830
Yeah, I'll help!

02:14.880 --> 02:16.750
Come on.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.340
- It's no good.
- It's coming!

02:21.520 --> 02:23.270
Listen... Just go!

02:23.320 --> 02:24.430
I'm not going without you.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.470
There's no point in us both sitting here!

02:26.520 --> 02:29.110
Oh, come on! - Look, just
go! - I'm not leaving you!

02:29.160 --> 02:31.070
Why do you have to be
so bloody obstinate?!

02:31.120 --> 02:33.320
It's coming, it's coming!

02:39.800 --> 02:42.150
 Don't want to drown no more

02:42.200 --> 02:44.710
 Sick of the same old people

02:44.760 --> 02:46.830
 The kind that'll sell your soul

02:46.880 --> 02:49.070
 And trade it for a shining stone

02:49.120 --> 02:51.270
 Ain't nothing in this life for free

02:51.320 --> 02:53.950
 Running from the greatest evil

02:54.000 --> 02:56.230
 It finally dawned on me

02:56.280 --> 02:58.270
 A man's got to fight temptation

02:58.320 --> 03:02.230
 Keep the wolves from the door

03:02.280 --> 03:06.430
 I hear them scratching
like I don't know better

03:06.480 --> 03:11.990
 Won't you keep the wolves from the door

03:12.040 --> 03:16.880
 It won't be long before I
cave in and open up the door. 

03:28.480 --> 03:29.550
Good morning.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.510
Hi, I'm Arrash Sayyad.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.830
Stefan Kowolski.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.680
Yes, do come in.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.630
Feel free to take a look around.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.880
It's always nice to get
a feel for the place.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.070
Neither of you are smokers?

03:47.120 --> 03:48.470
No.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.510
The owner is very insistent about that.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.710
And, of course, no animals.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.750
That's you out.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.720
Hm! Funny

03:57.120 --> 03:58.590
Who is the owner?

03:58.640 --> 04:01.510
It's not an individual, it's a company.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.190
You do realise it's very unusual
for a property of this calibre

04:06.240 --> 04:09.250
to come onto the rental market
and at such a low price?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.040
Oh, excuse me.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.880
We've got to take it!

04:18.160 --> 04:19.390
Mate, this place is amazing!

04:19.440 --> 04:20.950
Yeah.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.470
All right, well, let's tell her
we want it and get on with it.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.790
Yeah.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.070
There is... There's got to be a catch.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.630
- Why do you have to be so negative?
- Cos it's too good to be true.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.480
Mate, it's not...

04:34.440 --> 04:36.350
Amazing view!

04:36.400 --> 04:37.870
Told you.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.910
Excuse me?

04:41.960 --> 04:44.830
You didn't say anything about
this being an open house.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.070
I'm sorry. If you're
interested in the property,

04:48.120 --> 04:50.430
we'll consider you for the shortlist.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.110
How short exactly?

04:52.160 --> 04:55.350
We'll need to check your
finances and then your references

04:55.400 --> 04:58.670
and then there will be
interviews with the agency.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.400
- For everyone, or...?
- Not everyone.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.440
Not everyone.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.270
You're a detective, I'm a
serious fraud investigator.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.910
We're perfect.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.350
Yeah.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.470
As long as you don't get blind drunk
or high on drugs, we'll be fine.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.020
You're never going to let me forget that!
- No.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.560
It's perfect.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.200
Guv?

05:40.560 --> 05:42.590
Burglaries.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.230
You're not serious?

05:44.280 --> 05:47.430
Well, it's still a crime,
Derek, or hadn't you noticed?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.950
My heart bleeds for the victims,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.430
but it's not really our department, is it?

05:52.480 --> 05:54.350
Six burglaries in two months,

05:54.400 --> 05:57.190
high-end apartments, all smart addresses.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.310
Last week the AC had dinner at City Hall.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.800
The... subject came up.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.670
I get it. I suppose you want
me to take Wonder Boy with me.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.990
Well, you're a good team.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.230
We're not a team, we are a situation.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.910
Well, you're still getting
results. Here, I tell you what,

06:12.960 --> 06:16.150
his six-month probation
is up in two weeks.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.400
Want me to send him back?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.760
I'll think about it.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.550
Come on.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.230
What is it?

06:37.280 --> 06:40.320
It's me, telling you to get on your
feet and follow me, all right?!

07:00.360 --> 07:04.150
But fraud isn't just about making
money, it isn't about crime,

07:04.200 --> 07:06.870
it's about ruining people's lives.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.710
Helen and Colin Fraser, both in their 70s,

07:10.760 --> 07:15.280
put their entire life savings into a
property scheme, investing in Spain.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.350
But there was no property.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.830
They lost everything and then they...

07:20.880 --> 07:22.830
then they took their own lives.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.910
It's a fraud that has ripped
off British pensioners

07:26.960 --> 07:31.950
to the tune of 30 million since 2009.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.830
And the brains behind it all
is this man... Daniel Lorca.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.950
Lorca is invisible.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.070
He has no address in the UK, we
know almost nothing about him.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.390
We don't even know what he looks like.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.950
But I want to find him.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.400
This is the man that is
going to lead us to him.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.380
His name is John Malik.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.390
He is a lawyer and businessman

08:00.440 --> 08:03.440
who offers a full client
service to the super-rich.

08:05.080 --> 08:09.150
Oligarchs, drug traffickers,
Russian Mafia, you name it.

08:09.200 --> 08:15.110
John Malik represents Lorca's
"legitimate" business interests.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.990
But, this morning, a
warrant has been signed

08:18.040 --> 08:20.270
to search his office and his home.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.150
There will be two searches.

08:22.200 --> 08:26.910
Alison will take the office
team as temporary Case Controller

08:26.960 --> 08:28.350
and I'll take his home.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.430
But I want you to be very careful.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.039
Remember, this is a man who
consorts with major criminals.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.910
Good trip, Mr Malik?

08:44.960 --> 08:48.110
You know the best thing about Moscow, Smithson?
- No, sir.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.160
Getting the hell out!

08:51.280 --> 08:53.350
Where is that damn porter?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.390
Here, sir.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.710
Come on, don't keep me waiting.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.350
Home or office, sir?

08:59.400 --> 09:00.470
Office.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.990
They are heading for the office.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.710
'That's good, Stefan. Stay close.'

09:12.280 --> 09:13.830
We'd been away for the weekend.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.270
Anywhere nice?

09:15.320 --> 09:18.360
Wiltshire. We've got a house near Devizes.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.950
So, do you know what was taken?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.550
Money, about £300.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.110
Computer and...

09:27.160 --> 09:29.160
my wife's jewellery.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.590
A diamond necklace, some earrings,

09:33.640 --> 09:35.910
- her eternity ring.
- Insured?

09:35.960 --> 09:39.200
That's not the point, is it?
It's more the sentimental value.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.310
I'm sure.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.400
What about the alarm?

09:44.800 --> 09:48.000
Well... I was certain I'd put that on.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.550
I must have been mistaken.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.910
- Maybe he should get it checked.
- What?

10:08.960 --> 10:10.270
The alarm.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.190
That's good, that, yeah,
that will be a real help...

10:13.240 --> 10:15.980
now that everything has been nicked!

10:21.000 --> 10:22.550
Excuse me, have you got a minute

10:22.600 --> 10:25.110
to talk about how we can stamp
out child poverty in Africa?

10:25.160 --> 10:27.190
No, have you got a minute
to step out of the way?

10:27.240 --> 10:29.910
But w-we're raising money for
disadvantaged children...

10:29.960 --> 10:32.030
I've already got one, thanks.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.880
I'm sorry, mate.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.430
Our Child believes that
every child on the planet

10:49.480 --> 10:52.350
has a right to laughter and happiness.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.550
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
we ask you to welcome

10:57.600 --> 10:59.110
its founder and director,

10:59.160 --> 11:01.000
Lisa Douglas.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.910
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:04.960 --> 11:07.670
ten years ago, I made a promise

11:07.720 --> 11:12.110
that I would never show the
picture of an unhappy boy or girl

11:12.160 --> 11:16.750
and, with your help and with
the money we raise tonight,

11:16.800 --> 11:19.670
that is a promise that I mean to keep.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.270
- Was that all right?
- I think it's perfect.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.710
Level?

11:25.760 --> 11:27.230
Fine, Mrs Douglas.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.830
So, I'm speaking for five minutes?

11:28.880 --> 11:32.350
It's plenty, Wendy, we've
heard it all before!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.950
So, five minutes, then
we hand over to the band,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.470
they play their first set,

11:36.520 --> 11:40.150
then we introduce the silent
auction and serve the first course.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.030
People want to hear you too, Lisa.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.030
I'll play the room. Which is my table?

11:45.080 --> 11:46.670
Number three, over here.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.150
You're sitting between the
Minister and the Archbishop.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.990
Mm! Sounds like a rude joke!

11:51.040 --> 11:52.190
So, where's Michael?

11:52.240 --> 11:53.750
He's here.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.000
He was here a minute ago.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.510
I can't wait any longer,
I'm going to the police.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.470
Look, Michael, why are you
bringing this to me now?

12:06.520 --> 12:09.510
You're the chair of trustees,
Paul, you're responsible.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.270
Look, I'm not doubting your allegations.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.830
There is clearly an irregularity
in the Our Child accounts,

12:15.880 --> 12:18.670
but maybe you should consider
the question of timing.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.520
What do you mean?

12:21.280 --> 12:24.750
Tonight is the gala, it's the
biggest night of the year for Lisa.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.910
I know, I've just come from there.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.100
Then why raise this now?

12:29.480 --> 12:32.780
I raised this a week
ago, you've done nothing.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.870
Look, what exactly are you
asking me to do, Michael?

12:36.920 --> 12:39.060
Investigate my own wife?

12:40.120 --> 12:41.350
Yes.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.900
I think that's exactly
what I'm asking you to do.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.750
Look, give me a few more days.
Is that too much to ask?

12:55.800 --> 12:59.360
Let's get this gala out of the way
and then we can take look at it.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.350
Thank you.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.990
Have you told anybody else about this?

13:09.040 --> 13:10.380
No-one.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.310
Alex?

13:14.480 --> 13:17.220
I never talk about my work at home.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.140
And there are no copies?

13:21.240 --> 13:23.310
It's all on my laptop.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.190
Right.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.870
Could you please move away from your desks

13:39.920 --> 13:42.670
and do not touch your computers.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.390
We will be issuing receipts
for everything we take.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.750
What's going on?

13:46.800 --> 13:48.190
You are?

13:48.240 --> 13:51.510
Samuel Armstrong, I'm Mr
Malik's office manager.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.710
My name is Alison White,

13:52.760 --> 13:55.310
I am a case controller with
the Serious Fraud Office.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.190
I have in my possession a warrant

13:57.240 --> 14:00.510
authorising the Serious Fraud
Office to search these premises.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.090
What are you talking
about? Search them for what?

14:03.140 --> 14:04.470
No phone calls, please.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.320
We will do this as quickly as we can.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.790
Mr Malik, you might want to
steer clear of the office.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.710
We've got company.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.270
Forget about the office,
we are heading home.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.800
Shit.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.270
Sir?

14:30.320 --> 14:31.790
No chance.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.750
Someone's tipped him off,
he's on his way home.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.830
It will take him 30
minutes in this traffic.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.080
I'll be right behind him.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.590
Excuse me! That's got
nothing to do with John,

15:03.640 --> 15:06.070
that belongs to me. You can't take that.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.310
That cabinet was marked
international accounts.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.910
It wasn't in the cabinet.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.710
It was on it.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.750
John!

15:12.800 --> 15:15.340
- Log it with the rest.
- Sure.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.870
John! I'm so sorry!

15:18.920 --> 15:21.350
- It's all right, it's all right...
- I couldn't stop them!

15:21.400 --> 15:24.400
Don't upset yourself, it's not your fault.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.390
Typical of you, Marcus...
wait until I'm out of the way

15:27.440 --> 15:28.990
and then sneak in the back door.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.950
I'm looking for your client, Daniel Lorca.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.030
And you think you'll find him here?

15:34.080 --> 15:35.390
Do you know where he is?

15:35.440 --> 15:37.150
I haven't the faintest idea.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.190
Even if I did know, do
you think I'd tell you?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.310
Are you all done here?

15:43.920 --> 15:45.150
Thank you, Mr Malik.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.800
"Mr Malik"!

15:47.960 --> 15:50.430
It was "John" when you
were drinking my champagne.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.870
Well, that was then.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.150
Gone up in the world, have you, Marcus?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.870
Or is it down?

15:57.680 --> 16:00.670
You have a warrant to search
my premises, I take it?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.910
I gave the paperwork to your wife.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.430
Susan is not up to
reading the small print,

16:05.480 --> 16:07.950
but I promise you I will,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.800
every last word.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.440
You know him?

16:23.840 --> 16:25.640
I knew him once.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.710
Bastards!

16:31.760 --> 16:33.270
What are they looking for?

16:33.320 --> 16:35.190
Daniel Lorca.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.790
Who is Lorca?

16:36.840 --> 16:38.350
He's a client, he's no-one.

16:38.400 --> 16:43.070
John, there's something
that I need to tell you.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.910
- What?
- You know the Bermuda DVD?

16:44.960 --> 16:46.470
What, they took it?!

16:46.520 --> 16:49.150
- That's what I'm trying to tell you...
- You let them take it?!

16:49.200 --> 16:52.280
- I tried to stop them, but they just...
- Stupid bitch!

17:02.920 --> 17:05.069
It is an amazing place...

17:05.119 --> 17:08.349
two bedrooms, balcony, near the Tube.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.829
Where?

17:09.880 --> 17:11.109
Stratford.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.099
That's great, Rash.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.760
I'm really happy for you.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.300
No, you're not.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.869
Come on, what is it?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.990
Well I'll... miss you.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.590
- Will you?
- Of course.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.670
You should get your own place.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.230
With who?

17:35.280 --> 17:36.910
I'm not going anywhere.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.870
Actually, I'm applying to medical school.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.310
What, you'll leave the hospital?

17:42.360 --> 17:44.470
I want to be a doctor.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.950
I think it's great.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You should go for it.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.750
Hi.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.550
- What are you doing?!
- I was just passing,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.510
- I saw you through the window.
- No, you weren't,

17:55.560 --> 17:57.590
I told you I was going to be here.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.270
Hi, Leila.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.830
Nice to see you, Stefan.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.360
Why didn't you join us?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.910
He didn't invite me.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.230
That's right.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.830
What are you doing here?

18:15.880 --> 18:18.620
All right! I'm just being friendly!

18:20.480 --> 18:22.750
Have you... finished with them?

18:22.800 --> 18:24.270
Go ahead.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.510
So, have you told her?

18:32.560 --> 18:33.750
Yes.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.390
Have you told your flatmates?

18:35.440 --> 18:38.110
- No, that's different.
- Why?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.900
They're Polish.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.860
They get very emotional.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.510
Really?

18:44.560 --> 18:47.430
Yeah, I'm just going to move
out and hope they don't notice.

18:47.480 --> 18:51.190
I've got to go, I've got the night shift.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.580
I'll leave you two together.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.800
- Yeah, I'll pay
- Thanks.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.110
I really like her.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.500
OK.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.070
That's not going to work out.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.190
Why not?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.780
Because we are living together.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.640
Maybe I'll move out.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.830
Are you buying?

19:33.880 --> 19:34.990
I've already got mine.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.980
I'll have a scotch.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.270
- Are you getting any nuts?
- What sort of nuts?

19:43.320 --> 19:45.230
- Cashews.
- I've got peanuts.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.820
That'll do.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.640
Ta.

19:50.680 --> 19:51.790
Thanks, Derek.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.580
You're welcome.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.750
- How are you getting on, then?
- Burglaries?

19:59.800 --> 20:02.830
Oh, it's what I joined the
police for in the first place.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.830
Meet interesting rich people
who've had stuff nicked

20:05.880 --> 20:07.790
I couldn't even afford.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.070
Have you seen anyone about
this depression of yours, eh?

20:11.120 --> 20:13.260
Job makes me depressed.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.120
Maybe you've been in it too long.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.350
You trying to tell me something?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.940
I'm just trying to cheer you up.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.860
Have a nut.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.270
Listen, Lisa, I need to
talk to you about something.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.430
What?

20:57.480 --> 21:00.550
Erm, Michael came to see me today.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.390
He's a bit worried about something
to do with the accounts.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.070
Oh, not now, Paul. I mean, do you mind?

21:06.120 --> 21:08.790
Yeah, well, if not now, then when?

21:10.440 --> 21:12.230
I never see you these days.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.230
You're always off in some world of your own.
- I'm busy.

21:16.280 --> 21:18.870
No, there's more to it than that.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.230
There's something you're not telling me.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.220
Can we just get through tonight, please?

21:28.360 --> 21:30.230
Thank you.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.120
Over here, thank you!

21:36.720 --> 21:39.190
Thank you, this way, this way.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.000
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.780
What is it?

21:57.800 --> 21:59.200
What?

22:00.200 --> 22:03.070
You've hardly said a word all evening.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.240
I'm sorry.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.270
What is it you're not telling me, Michael?

22:14.320 --> 22:17.920
Why did you go back to see
your old boss last week?

22:19.080 --> 22:21.910
I've found something and
I don't know what to do.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.230
I've come to you because...

22:23.280 --> 22:25.710
Well, don't get me wrong,
you know about these things.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.950
You have experience.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.200
I wonder if you could look at
these accounts from Our Child.

22:33.400 --> 22:37.320
- You know we don't talk about work.
- We do if there's something wrong.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.880
You should have gone to the gala.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.180
Hm? Why didn't you?

22:47.280 --> 22:49.190
Black tie...

22:49.240 --> 22:51.070
champagne...

22:51.120 --> 22:52.460
celebs.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.870
I didn't feel like it.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.830
I'm tired.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.030
I'll clear up.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.590
You go to bed.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.120
OK.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.390
What is it?

23:33.440 --> 23:35.270
I thought I heard something.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.870
What?

23:36.920 --> 23:38.460
Downstairs.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.960
It's nothing.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.860
I'm going down.

23:50.360 --> 23:51.590
I'll come.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.110
No, it's OK. Go back to sleep.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.880
Alex!

24:33.160 --> 24:36.270
My husband's upstairs. He'll
be calling the police.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.460
You should leave... now!

25:07.560 --> 25:10.310
He's been stabbed. He's got
multiple lacerations on his back.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.150
He's bleeding internally and I
think his liver's been punctured.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.350
There was burglars. It
happened in the flat.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.430
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.270
- We'll take care of him. Leila!
- Yeah.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.630
We need to stabilise
him. He's bleeding fast.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.950
He's got a weak, rapid pulse.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.830
I'll fast-bleep the vascular surgeons.

25:24.880 --> 25:28.480
- He'll need to go to theatre.
- Yeah, get onto it.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.710
Those burglaries you're investigating.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.070
Yes, guv.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.390
It's now attempted murder.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.990
Are you happy?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.510
Yes, guv.

25:46.720 --> 25:50.030
With ticket sales and the silent auction,

25:50.080 --> 25:52.270
our gala last night

25:52.320 --> 25:54.510
raised the amazing sum

25:54.560 --> 25:59.120
of £420,000!

26:01.200 --> 26:04.550
Thank you, everyone. That's
all down to your effort.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.630
It's a fantastic result.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.870
And to those of you who weren't invited,

26:08.920 --> 26:11.630
I'm sorry, it was a fabulous evening, too.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.000
So let's get back to work.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.600
Lisa? - Mm. - Paul
is in your office. - OK.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.870
Paul.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.830
What is it?

26:32.880 --> 26:35.470
Lisa, I've got some bad news.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.830
It's Michael.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.150
What?

26:39.760 --> 26:42.790
Alex just called. Michael's in hospital.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.550
He was stabbed last night.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.950
Apparently there was some
kind of a burglary in his home.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.830
Why did he call you?
Why didn't he call me?

26:51.880 --> 26:53.790
Is that really the issue?

26:53.840 --> 26:56.710
No, of course not, I didn't mean that.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.750
- How is he?
- Well, I called the hospital.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.140
He's in critical condition.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.510
It was a brutal attack in his home.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.030
Lisa, he's your chief
accountant, for God's sake.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.670
I told you yesterday he was worried
about something and now this.

27:12.720 --> 27:13.990
Yeah.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.470
Do you think it's just a coincidence?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.230
What else could it be?

27:26.280 --> 27:30.590
- What are you suggesting?
- I don't know, Lisa. You tell me.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.190
Look, we raised nearly half
a million pounds last night.

27:34.240 --> 27:38.030
Do you have any idea what
difference that's going to make?

27:38.080 --> 27:39.750
You just don't get it, do you?

27:39.800 --> 27:42.560
No, Lisa, I don't.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.950
Two men, married.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.070
I suppose that sort of
thing doesn't bother you.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.350
Uh, no.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.190
- Does it bother you, Sarge?
- Of course it doesn't. Why should it?

28:02.240 --> 28:05.240
Anyway, it's none of your bloody business.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.060
There's not much to say.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.190
Michael heard something.

28:17.240 --> 28:20.400
It woke him up and he came downstairs.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.820
And you didn't come
down with your, erm...?

28:27.960 --> 28:29.500
My husband.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.700
No, I'm a much heavier sleeper.

28:38.440 --> 28:42.960
I heard him call out to me and then
there was silence, so I came down.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.600
He was in there.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.670
There was a lot of blood.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.430
I was shocked, I didn't know what to do.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.190
I dialled 999.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.990
Has anything been taken?

28:56.040 --> 28:58.980
Well, I haven't had much chance to look.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.070
But I don't think so.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.670
They broke a few things.

29:02.720 --> 29:05.040
Oh, his laptop was taken.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.030
He must have surprised them.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.960
He works for a charity, hm?

29:13.640 --> 29:16.350
Our Child, yes.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.950
How long has he been there?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.590
About two years.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.180
He's not happy at work. He's...

29:24.120 --> 29:27.320
.. been having problems.
That's why he couldn't sleep.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.400
- Does he talk about his work?
- Not much.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.070
We try not to.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.030
I notice you have a burglar alarm.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.750
Was it on last night?

29:38.800 --> 29:40.430
It should have been.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.550
Michael usually put it
on before he went to bed.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.440
- And is it working?
- I don't know.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.840
It was fine a week ago,
but if it didn't go off...

29:54.040 --> 29:55.840
But I don't know.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.630
Ayjay Alarms.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.870
Really?

30:08.920 --> 30:12.550
Eh, seven burglaries
in the last two months.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.630
Three of the properties
have the same alarm system,

30:15.680 --> 30:17.270
including this one.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.350
Oh, thanks for pointing that out, Sayyad,

30:19.400 --> 30:22.270
I'm sure I would never have noticed

30:22.440 --> 30:24.430
- Sorry, Sarge...
- Yeah, but you're not, are you?

30:24.480 --> 30:25.550
That's your problem...

30:25.600 --> 30:27.750
you think you're God's
gift to modern policing.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.270
Well, you're not, you're
just a bloody TDC.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.590
I'm just trying to do my job.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.380
Exactly, so stop trying to do mine.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.760
Here you go.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.340
Thanks.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.830
Lorca?

30:49.880 --> 30:51.990
Yes, well, the SFO aren't the police,

30:52.040 --> 30:54.230
they are just a bunch
of glorified accountants

30:54.280 --> 30:56.350
with a high opinion of themselves,

30:56.400 --> 30:59.550
and they're wasting their time
chasing after Daniel Lorca.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.150
But they've got something.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.800
That's right. The Bermuda DVD.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.760
Susan should never have let them take it.

31:13.160 --> 31:15.310
It's a holiday resort, for God's sake.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.430
It's also a tax haven.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.840
It doesn't matter what
it is. I want it back.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.510
What are you looking for?

31:26.560 --> 31:28.960
I'll know when I've found it.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.550
Marcus, you didn't tell me you knew Malik.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.230
- I didn't think it was relevant.
- Well, it might be.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.110
- He's asked for a meeting.
- So?

31:43.160 --> 31:45.030
I think he's going to use his association

31:45.080 --> 31:47.670
to overturn the warrant...
or at least he's going to try.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.870
And if he's successful, anything we find will be inadmissible.
- He won't.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.830
- I worked for him, that's all.
- You should have mentioned it before.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.230
I didn't think it mattered.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.510
Of course it matters, he
can use it against us.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.900
Stefan.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.390
- I think I might have found something.
- What is it?

32:03.440 --> 32:06.070
Well, John Malik does a lot of
big stuff for his clients...

32:06.120 --> 32:08.590
contracts, acquisitions,
that sort of thing.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.430
But he also does small stuff
too... tickets to Ascot,

32:11.480 --> 32:13.750
- opera, car rentals.
- And?

32:13.800 --> 32:17.080
I was looking through the
invoices and I found this.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.910
12 vintage bottles of champagne.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.710
Bought on behalf of Daniel Lorca.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.270
There's an address for delivery,
a place in Notting Hill.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.270
- I thought I might take a look.
- Yes, you do that.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.990
And, Stefan...

32:33.840 --> 32:35.440
.. well done.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.390
- Detective Sergeant Sands, DC Sayyad.
- How can I help?

32:43.440 --> 32:45.670
You're Ayjay Kapour?
This is your business?

32:45.720 --> 32:47.590
It's a family business, yeah.

32:47.640 --> 32:51.390
Can you confirm you installed
burglar alarms at these addresses?

32:51.440 --> 32:53.630
Er, yeah, I believe so.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.390
I can't be sure... we install
hundreds of alarms every year.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.510
Oh. Obviously not up to much, are they?

32:58.560 --> 33:00.670
Why do you say that?

33:00.720 --> 33:03.750
14 Waldegrave Mansions,
26 Lorimer Gardens,

33:03.800 --> 33:06.190
3 Kenville Terrace...

33:06.240 --> 33:07.990
they've all been burgled.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.190
There's nothing wrong with our products.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.430
Another three addresses here.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.110
They have different alarm systems

33:14.160 --> 33:18.150
but it turns out they all have
maintenance agreements with you.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.700
- Why are you showing me this?
- Why do you think?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.590
They've all been burgled too.

33:25.640 --> 33:29.400
And in each case, the alarm system
was miraculously deactivated.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.630
- This is very worrying.
- I'm sure it is.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.150
Look, I can't help you, Mr Sands.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.990
- You need to speak to my head of programming.
- Who might that be?

33:38.040 --> 33:40.840
His name is William Gardner. William!

33:43.760 --> 33:45.030
Yeah?

34:32.960 --> 34:34.830
What kept you?

34:34.880 --> 34:37.080
You're losing your touch!

34:49.880 --> 34:51.270
How's he doing?

34:51.320 --> 34:53.270
Generally, he's fine.

34:53.320 --> 34:56.870
He's still very sleepy and his
potassium levels are a bit low.

34:56.920 --> 35:01.030
He could be hypokalaemic from the
blood transfusion he received.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.390
Are you still going ahead
with medical school?

35:03.440 --> 35:06.310
I was going to ask you for a reference.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.310
I'll be glad to do that.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.390
Thanks.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.430
In the meantime, let's give him
10ml of potassium chloride per hour

35:12.480 --> 35:14.630
over five hours and see where we are after that.
- OK.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.790
Excuse me, do you think
it might be possible

35:16.840 --> 35:18.310
to see Michael Freeland, please?

35:18.360 --> 35:21.070
- Are you family?
- I'm Lucy Douglas, Michael works for me.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.670
I understand, but Michael's
in a very critical condition,

35:23.720 --> 35:26.550
Mrs Douglas. They are only allowing
immediate family to visit him.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.750
We just spoke to his partner
... and we are sort of family.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.400
Yeah, we'd only be a few minutes.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.390
All right.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.720
Take a seat.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.440
Mr Freeland's files.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.860
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

35:48.640 --> 35:52.110
Do you think you could handle the infusion?
- Yeah.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.990
I've done it before, I know what to do.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.710
Thanks, Leila, that's great.
10ml per hour over five hours.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.550
Right. OK.

35:59.600 --> 36:03.500
- Can I get you something?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.350
Hi, sorry to disturb you both.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.950
- Just got to give him this.
- What is it?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.940
Potassium chloride.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.670
Raised blood pressure.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.190
Yes.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.920
- Is that serious?
- No, it's what you'd expect after surgery.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.790
So, are you going to
stay with him all night?

36:31.840 --> 36:34.110
No, only until midnight.

36:34.160 --> 36:38.190
Don't worry, I'll be having a
word with the nurse coming in.

36:38.240 --> 36:41.070
Alex!
- Shh, relax, Mr Freeland. Stay calm, try not to move.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.790
11, 12, 13...

36:44.840 --> 36:45.990
Just relax.

36:46.040 --> 36:49.830
11, 12, 13...

36:49.880 --> 36:52.620
- What is it?
- I don't understand.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.750
- 11, 12...
- Shh.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.270
Tell him!

36:59.360 --> 37:00.710
Just relax.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.480
11, 12...

37:03.760 --> 37:07.200
Is he OK?
- Don't worry, he's still under a lot of sedation.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.360
His pulse is stabilising.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.980
He'll be all right.

37:21.760 --> 37:24.160
- So, I've got news.
- Yeah?

37:25.640 --> 37:27.030
We got it.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.680
- The flat?
- No, the interview.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.070
We're on the shortlist,

37:32.120 --> 37:35.070
but we've got to be at the estate
agent's after work on Tuesday,

37:35.120 --> 37:37.110
all right? Five o'clock.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.230
- And there's three others.
- Three others?

37:39.280 --> 37:40.710
- Yeah.
- We're in.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.230
- Mr Lorca?
- That's me, yeah.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.680
What?

37:45.760 --> 37:47.760
I locked myself out.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.110
- What?
- It's my London pad.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.190
I can get the lock open for you,

37:53.240 --> 37:56.230
but I can't let you in without seeing ID.

37:56.280 --> 37:59.080
Oh, my ID's inside.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.670
But it's all right, he's a police officer.
- What?!

38:03.720 --> 38:07.220
Stop saying "what" and
show him your warrant card!

38:16.160 --> 38:17.760
Detective...

38:18.400 --> 38:20.140
.. Constable...

38:20.480 --> 38:21.960
.. Sayyad.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.550
You know this man?

38:27.640 --> 38:29.440
- Yeah.
- Right.

38:34.520 --> 38:38.110
- What's all this about?
- It's SFO, it's all right.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.700
No, it's not all right. This...

38:41.720 --> 38:43.750
This is breaking and entering.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.910
If I'm found in here I'm going
to get booted out. Again!

38:46.960 --> 38:49.270
No-one's going to find out.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.590
How can you do this to me?

38:52.120 --> 38:55.520
There you are. I'll send
a bill to this address.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.840
I knew I shouldn't have come out with you.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.420
What are we doing here?

39:08.560 --> 39:13.590
We are looking for a
man called Daniel Lorca.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.990
I thought we were going to the pub.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.990
He's a fraudster. He's a crook.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.040
Two old people killed
themselves because of him.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.350
What old people?

39:25.400 --> 39:27.990
It doesn't matter, we're
trying to find him.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.430
Right, and he lives here?

39:29.480 --> 39:32.760
He had 12 bottles of champagne
delivered here a month ago.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.670
Nothing in the fridge.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.640
Oven's brand-new.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.390
None of this stuff's ever been used.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.030
Maybe he just bought it.

39:53.080 --> 39:56.310
You just said he had champagne
delivered here a month ago!

39:56.360 --> 39:58.200
OK, er...

39:59.680 --> 40:01.620
Let's try upstairs.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.080
Stefan...

40:15.320 --> 40:18.190
I told you. No-one actually lives here.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.230
Bed's never been slept in.
Toilet's never been used.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.470
Do you mind if we get out of
here before someone comes?

40:24.520 --> 40:26.550
No-one's going to come.

40:26.600 --> 40:29.270
Look, there's got to be something.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.670
Bonhams...

40:38.720 --> 40:40.800
wine-tasting...

40:43.800 --> 40:45.800
What about this?

40:47.240 --> 40:49.150
A hammam?

40:49.200 --> 40:51.390
Yeah, it's a Turkish bath.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.580
Yeah. I know what it is.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.470
I don't believe this.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.310
How did they know we were here?

41:01.360 --> 41:03.910
I don't know how they
knew we were here, Stefan.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.830
Maybe there's an alarm.
Maybe the neighbours saw us.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.310
That doesn't matter.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.760
What matters is, WHAT are
we going to tell them?

41:19.240 --> 41:21.710
It's all right. It's
all right, I've got him.

41:21.760 --> 41:24.510
- What?
- Oh, I'm DC Sayyad.

41:24.560 --> 41:28.110
I've been investigating a series
of burglaries with my boss,

41:28.160 --> 41:31.470
DS sands. He's on the way with backup.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.750
- Who is this, then?
- He's...

41:33.800 --> 41:37.150
Please... I see empty
house. I do nothing wrong.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.510
Oh, be quiet, you, all right? Um...

41:39.560 --> 41:40.990
I'm on top of this.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.870
I'm all right. House is secure.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.390
'Alpha 26 to the Rose and
Crown on Alma Street.

41:46.440 --> 41:49.280
'Immediate response required.'

41:57.880 --> 41:59.710
Wait.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.630
- He was here.
- Who?

42:08.680 --> 42:11.030
Daniel Lorca.

42:11.080 --> 42:13.710
Why would he keep an empty
house? What's the point?

42:13.760 --> 42:18.190
He had the champagne delivered
here a month ago, and...

42:18.240 --> 42:20.120
this.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.240
What's...

42:28.840 --> 42:30.350
No. Forget it.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.790
You can go if you want,
I'm not interested.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.720
I've had enough.

42:46.480 --> 42:50.590
I shouldn't have bothered, should
I? Trying to argue with you.

42:50.640 --> 42:55.160
- You still talked me into it.
- You might enjoy it. - I might not.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.400
- Hi.
- Merhaba!

43:13.840 --> 43:15.270
Yes?

43:15.320 --> 43:17.110
Oh, we booked the Discovery package.

43:17.160 --> 43:20.460
- What's your name, please?
- Stefan Kowolski.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.600
With a K.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.110
Yes, Mr Kowolski.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.150
I see you paid in advance.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.390
Is this your first time here?

43:30.440 --> 43:32.030
Yeah.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.990
Eren?

43:34.040 --> 43:35.710
Eren will look after you.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.950
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.750
By the way, a friend of mine
comes here from time to time.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.950
- Daniel Lorca.
- Lorca?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.270
He hasn't visited recently, has he?

43:46.320 --> 43:48.190
I'm afraid I don't know him.

43:48.240 --> 43:49.870
Thank you.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.910
Follow me, please.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.520
Yep.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.310
Mr Malik.

44:17.360 --> 44:21.600
Thank you, Yusef. Just deal
with that for me, would you?

44:23.920 --> 44:26.660
Eleanor Davies will see you shortly.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.030
Admit it...

44:58.080 --> 45:00.950
you're enjoying this.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.280
No. I'm not enjoying it.

45:04.760 --> 45:07.390
I'm hot, I'm sweating,
and I should be at work.

45:07.440 --> 45:10.760
Well, the Discovery package
comes with free mint tea.

45:13.240 --> 45:15.990
Look, this is a complete waste of time.

45:16.040 --> 45:20.150
Even assuming Lorca does come here,
how are you going to find him?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.000
I'll ask around.

45:23.800 --> 45:27.030
Right, but you can ask around without me.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.710
I'm out of here.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.960
What?!

45:37.120 --> 45:40.470
I'm a respected lawyer
and business manager,

45:40.520 --> 45:43.030
and I do not appreciate being victimised.

45:43.080 --> 45:46.790
If you want to help us, you can
tell us how to find your client,

45:46.840 --> 45:48.270
Daniel Lorca.

45:48.320 --> 45:51.990
You must be aware that I can't
talk about any of my clients.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.190
Then I'm afraid we can't help you.

45:54.240 --> 45:58.030
I'm sorry.
- You're going to be more than sorry, Ms Davies.

45:58.080 --> 46:01.110
I have already been
granted a judicial review,

46:01.160 --> 46:03.430
which was just the first step.

46:03.480 --> 46:06.350
I will be seeking massive
damages against the SFO.

46:06.400 --> 46:08.470
On what grounds?

46:08.520 --> 46:10.190
You took files and documents

46:10.240 --> 46:13.150
that were completely
unrelated to Daniel Lorca.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.430
Your warrant is clearly in breach
of legal professional privilege.

46:16.480 --> 46:19.510
You took personal items,
which is tantamount to theft.

46:19.560 --> 46:21.710
- Personal items?
- Yeah.

46:21.760 --> 46:24.310
Private photograph albums, a DVD,

46:24.360 --> 46:27.590
letters that have nothing to
do with my business affairs.

46:27.640 --> 46:30.710
Everything will be treated
with the utmost confidentiality

46:30.760 --> 46:34.390
- and returned to you in due course.
- You don't get it, do you?

46:34.440 --> 46:37.470
You picked a fight which
you are going to lose.

46:37.520 --> 46:41.590
I give you 24 hours to return
everything you've taken.

46:41.640 --> 46:43.120
Or else?

46:55.280 --> 46:57.620
You're looking for Mr Lorca?

46:58.440 --> 47:00.150
I'm a friend of his.

47:00.200 --> 47:02.870
Mr Lorca doesn't have any friends.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.510
- Get off me!
- Who are you? - No-one!

47:07.560 --> 47:09.150
Agh! OK.

47:09.200 --> 47:13.150
OK, I am with the SFO, the
Serious Fraud Office, all right?

47:13.200 --> 47:14.430
I don't believe you.

47:14.480 --> 47:17.710
I haven't got my ID on me.
I haven't got my clothes.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.430
Turn him over.

47:19.480 --> 47:22.750
I'm going to cut off
what's under that towel.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.040
If you still say you're
SFO, then I'll believe you.

48:06.480 --> 48:08.280
Stefan, come on!

48:13.720 --> 48:15.630
This way.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.110
Chill, chill, chill.

48:21.160 --> 48:22.430
Yeah.

48:25.240 --> 48:27.080
Oh, boy.

48:31.520 --> 48:33.720
OK.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.350
So?

48:37.400 --> 48:39.800
Aren't you going to thank me?

48:41.000 --> 48:43.030
I was there for you, I saved you.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.590
OK, thanks.

48:44.640 --> 48:48.160
I would have got out anyway. I had a move.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.310
You'd have got away
without your balls, mate.

48:53.360 --> 48:55.790
At least we found something out.
- What?

48:55.840 --> 48:59.040
Well, someone doesn't want
us to find Daniel Lorca.

49:00.680 --> 49:03.020
I think we knew that anyway.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.390
Can I have some help, please?
I have a cardiac arrest.

49:17.440 --> 49:20.590
Nurse, straight on the chest.
Can I have 150 joules charged?

49:20.640 --> 49:22.270
Charging to 150.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.460
Shocking. Shocking now.

49:25.720 --> 49:28.630
- He's not responding.
- One, two, three...

49:28.680 --> 49:30.270
Shocking now.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.310
One, two, three...

49:32.360 --> 49:34.630
He's still not responding.

49:35.960 --> 49:38.840
Abort resuscitation. We've lost him.

50:06.680 --> 50:09.980
- Welcome to England, Mr Kumalah.
- Thank you.

50:29.080 --> 50:31.160
Take me to the hotel.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.470
Kumalah arrived in
London a few minutes ago.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.830
Do we know where he's staying?

50:44.880 --> 50:47.950
He has got a suite at the
Royal Claremont hotel, Mayfair.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.150
£900 a night.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.670
Not bad for someone coming from a country

50:51.720 --> 50:54.990
that receives 800 million a year in aid.
- Right.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.470
Go to the hotel and keep an eye on him.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.950
I want to know everyone he meets.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.830
Come out, I want to see you.

51:02.880 --> 51:04.030
One minute.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.420
It's been too long already.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.590
Come back to bed.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.470
Call room service.

51:09.520 --> 51:12.030
- What do you want?
- Champagne.

51:12.080 --> 51:13.950
I can't believe you're back.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.920
You have no idea how I've
been counting the hours.

51:21.080 --> 51:23.220
Come home with me, Lisa.

51:24.080 --> 51:27.270
It's all going to happen,
everything we talked about.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.630
- You should be there.
- Changing the world.

51:29.680 --> 51:33.110
'My world. Yes, my country.

51:33.160 --> 51:36.670
'What you're doing, what you
have done, it's amazing.'

51:36.720 --> 51:38.230
'We did it together, David.'

51:38.280 --> 51:41.040
Which is why we should BE together.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.390
Cardiac arrest, 12.07am.

51:58.440 --> 51:59.910
Yes.

51:59.960 --> 52:03.190
There will have to be an
inquiry, the police are involved.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.590
I did absolutely nothing wrong, Harriet.

52:05.640 --> 52:08.710
Michael Freeland had been
out of surgery 24 hours.

52:08.760 --> 52:11.430
No complications, he was in full recovery.

52:11.480 --> 52:14.310
You prescribed potassium chloride?

52:14.360 --> 52:17.110
Yes, 10ml per hour over five hours.

52:17.160 --> 52:19.900
That's not what this setting shows.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.740
It's wrong.

52:26.280 --> 52:29.080
This is set to inject 100ml per hour.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.510
Where do these go?

52:35.560 --> 52:38.830
Oh, they're for your brother.
Put them in the fridge.

52:38.880 --> 52:42.720
You know what he's like with his
supplements and power drinks.

52:44.360 --> 52:47.190
Would you miss him? If he moved out?

52:47.240 --> 52:48.910
Why do you ask?

52:48.960 --> 52:50.870
Of course I would.

52:50.920 --> 52:54.310
But he will have to, one day. You too.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.560
Are you seeing anyone?

52:58.120 --> 53:00.270
- Mum...
- I'm allowed to ask.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.430
And I'm allowed to not answer.

53:02.480 --> 53:06.630
- It's just, I met this young man in court.
- Oh, great. He's a criminal?

53:06.680 --> 53:10.870
No, you works for the Immigration
Department. But I liked him.

53:10.920 --> 53:12.510
YOU marry him, then.

53:12.560 --> 53:15.070
Maybe you should start
thinking about that.

53:15.120 --> 53:18.120
- No, I'm thinking about you.
- I'm fine.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.600
Yes?

53:27.680 --> 53:29.760
Why, what's happened?

53:52.800 --> 53:56.910
I'm afraid I have bad news for you, Leila.

53:56.960 --> 54:01.200
One of your patients, Michael
Freeland, died last night.

54:03.680 --> 54:05.360
How?

54:07.280 --> 54:08.830
What happened?

54:08.880 --> 54:12.750
It seems a mistake was made with
the dosage of potassium chloride

54:12.800 --> 54:15.070
that Dr Benson prescribed.

54:15.120 --> 54:17.750
10ml per hour over five hours.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.550
I gave him the right dose.

54:19.600 --> 54:21.600
We don't believe so.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.880
I'm telling you I did.

54:26.200 --> 54:27.630
Have you checked the machine?

54:27.680 --> 54:29.950
It'll be thoroughly examined, of course.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.630
It was serviced two weeks ago.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.480
There was nothing wrong with it then.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.350
- You're blaming me.
- I wasn't there.

54:39.320 --> 54:40.630
I'm sorry.

54:40.680 --> 54:42.710
There will be a full inquiry, Leila.

54:42.760 --> 54:45.830
But you should perhaps
consider taking legal advice,

54:45.880 --> 54:48.220
and talk to your union rep.

54:51.360 --> 54:52.720
Yeah.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.390
You want to know who
killed Michael Freeland?

55:24.440 --> 55:26.180
I can help you.

55:30.280 --> 55:33.550
Everything is in place. I
just have to press the button.

55:33.600 --> 55:37.080
Police, SFO. Why are you working together?
