And since I was kind of

21:18.417 --> 21:20.792
a jerk there for a while,

21:20.834 --> 21:22.458
I owe you guys something.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.750
How about we go get that pool?

21:23.792 --> 21:25.917
- Oh, no,

21:23.792 --> 21:25.917
no more competitions.

21:25.959 --> 21:27.250
- That's how

21:25.959 --> 21:27.250
this whole thing started.

21:27.291 --> 21:28.542
- Yeah, and you're

21:27.291 --> 21:28.542
more important to us

21:28.583 --> 21:30.166
than any pool.

21:30.208 --> 21:33.083
- Actually, I had

21:30.208 --> 21:33.083
another idea in mind.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.041
- Wow!

21:33.125 --> 21:35.041
Kids, I am impressed.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.458
You really turned

21:35.083 --> 21:36.458
this lemonade stand around.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.959
What's your secret?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
- Well, we added

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
a signature ingredient

21:40.041 --> 21:41.500
to our recipe.

21:41.542 --> 21:43.667
- Now it's lemons,

21:41.542 --> 21:43.667
sugar, water...

21:43.709 --> 21:45.583
- And a show.

21:48.041 --> 21:50.709
[applause]

21:50.750 --> 21:52.834
- Make it rain, Rickity Doo-Dah.

21:52.875 --> 21:55.792
<i>- Hey, where are</i>

21:52.875 --> 21:55.792
<i>all my good pitchers?</i>

21:55.834 --> 21:56.834

21:58.625 --> 21:59.709
No idea, Mom.

22:00.333 --> 22:01.333
[laughs nervously]

22:01.375 --> 22:02.917
- Where is she?

22:02.959 --> 22:05.542
- I'm right behind you.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.542
And I know where they are.
