[sighs]

12:15.901 --> 12:17.486
They didn't need to pull their guns.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.821
They leveled their weapons

12:18.904 --> 12:21.991
when one of those kids tried to grab
one of my men's sidearms.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.243
The video doesn't show that.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.412
Maybe you can take my word on it.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.420
[doula] <i>The most important</i>
<i>thing to remember</i>

12:34.503 --> 12:38.382
is that the birth of a child
is a sacred experience.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.553
Really? You need to write down "sacred"?

12:42.928 --> 12:46.056
-She just said it was important.
-Questions?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.224
-Yes.
-No.

12:48.184 --> 12:51.729
-In case of breech birth--
-I'm gonna stop you there.

12:52.480 --> 12:58.152
As a birth partner, your main job is to
surround mom with light and love.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.738
Light and love. Got it.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.991
Okay, let's start
with some breathing exercises.

13:04.158 --> 13:07.244
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.413
[inhaling and exhaling]

13:09.497 --> 13:11.874
-Breathing in the love...
-[door opens]

13:11.957 --> 13:13.709
...and breathing out peace.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.545
Sorry I'm late.

13:17.129 --> 13:21.425
[doula] Breathing in love,
and breathing out peace.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.805
Clive, honey.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.558
Breathe out peace.

13:29.725 --> 13:30.559
[doula] And out.

13:37.525 --> 13:41.362
Okay, let's finish with a slow massage
down the spine.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.364
Spend some time on the shoulders...

13:43.447 --> 13:46.075
Babe, are you sanding me?

13:47.618 --> 13:49.286
-I'm sorry.
-[doula] Okay.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.664
Thank you, everybody. Great work.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.707
We should probably say hello.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.835
-I guess. It's only polite.
-Mmm.

13:58.587 --> 14:03.676
It would be helpful if you found
a birthing partner before next class.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.972
I help out the single moms when I can,
but it makes teaching harder.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.766
-Got it. Thanks.
-Okay.

14:12.643 --> 14:16.480
I'd say "Small world,"
but it's a walled-in city, so...

14:16.564 --> 14:17.690
[Clive chuckles]

14:18.190 --> 14:19.400
I was, uh...

14:21.110 --> 14:22.862
Well, yeah... So...

14:23.279 --> 14:24.780
Small world indeed.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.491
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you. You too.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.785
Just three more months to go.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.161
-You?
-About the same.

14:32.496 --> 14:36.500
Cool. [coughs]
Cool. That's cool.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.961
-Really cool.
-Yeah.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.130
I'm kinda late for something,
so I should...

14:41.213 --> 14:44.383
-Of course, yes. Good to see you.
-Bye.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.427
Okay.

14:49.305 --> 14:54.435
So, I take it from the banquet
of nervous facial expressions

14:54.518 --> 14:55.644
I was just treated to

14:55.728 --> 14:59.356
that you did in fact sleep with Michelle
before we got back together.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.400
Yeah.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.278
-So, there's a chance...
-I guess.

15:05.195 --> 15:08.532
I mean, I haven't seen or spoken to her
since she transferred over to vice.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.368
-Huh.
-It was one time. It happened once.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.413
And then the next day Cavanaugh told me
the reason you broke up with me,

15:14.496 --> 15:15.789
and I ended things.

15:16.290 --> 15:21.045
So, you slept with her,
then broke up with her the next day

15:21.754 --> 15:24.924
-and asked me to marry you.
-Yeah.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.886
It sounds a lot faster
when you say it like that.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.765
You mean, when I say it in the order
in which it happened?

15:32.973 --> 15:36.894
Babe, I'm really trying to do
light, love and calm right now.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.731
You need to talk to her
and get some answers.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.616
[Liv] I started out in musical theater,
did a bit of company work

15:50.699 --> 15:52.242
and then just commercial stuff.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.787
[Tina] What about you, Jake?
Any formal training?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.873
-Hmm?
-Any formal training?

15:58.332 --> 15:59.166
Oh...

15:59.249 --> 16:03.754
Yeah. [chuckles]
I, um, studied ballet as a child.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.882
-Huh.
-It's strange how it happened, actually.

16:06.966 --> 16:11.387
Uh, small town boy, coal mining family.
My dad was this tough-as-nails widower,

16:11.470 --> 16:13.097
who wanted me to take boxing classes,

16:13.180 --> 16:15.766
but I stumbled into
a ballet class at the gym,

16:15.849 --> 16:16.684
and I was hooked.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.687
-Wow, great story.
-[muffled] Mmm-hmm.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.772
Right? He's just basically Billy Elliot.

16:22.064 --> 16:22.898
[Lars] Yeah.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.735
So, uh, why do you want out of Seattle?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.737
I have an offer to tour with Cardi B.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.532
-You're a singer too?
-As one of her dancers.

16:31.615 --> 16:32.700
What about you, Lars?

16:32.992 --> 16:36.453
I'm trying to get back to Madison
to see my mom before she dies.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.539
What about you two?

16:38.622 --> 16:40.708
-Oh, um...
-[Ravi stammers]

16:41.250 --> 16:44.503
Well, honestly,
I just want to dance on TV.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.007
-[music starts playing]
-[whooping and cheering]

16:55.889 --> 16:58.684
-They have dancing here?
-Yeah, it's a hidden gem.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.938
We came here on our first date.
It's a special place for us.

17:03.313 --> 17:07.067
Well, how is that... [chuckles]
There were tables there...

17:07.317 --> 17:10.320
How can there be dancing?
It's called The Lazy Squid.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.321
I love this song.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.781
-You have to come dance with me.
-Oh...

17:12.865 --> 17:16.994
Remember how I pulled something
during rehearsal?

17:17.077 --> 17:19.496
Yeah, well, just keep me company.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.458
[laughs] You want me to keep you company
on the dance floor?

17:22.583 --> 17:23.500
Yeah.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.390
You promised I wouldn't have to dance.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.769
I will dance for both of us.
You just bring the smolder.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.205
Look at him.

18:02.831 --> 18:06.543
I know. He refuses to give anything away.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.547
Liv, Tina left her phone on the table.
Let's go.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.174
The song isn't over yet.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.760
-Can you focus, please?
-I am focused.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.846
I just don't understand why you
can't spend five minutes with me

18:17.930 --> 18:19.515
without also trying to solve a murder.

18:19.890 --> 18:20.724
Liv...

18:24.019 --> 18:27.606
-You know how we finish...
-Each other's sentences.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.274
Yes, and sometimes can
even read each other's--

18:29.358 --> 18:30.192
Texts!

18:30.442 --> 18:32.111
-Mmm...
-Um... Um...

18:32.194 --> 18:33.487
-Minds!
-[grunts]

18:33.570 --> 18:34.738
So, what am I thinking right now?

18:35.030 --> 18:38.117
You want to get the phone,
solve the case,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.953
and eventually become dance partners.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.496
Close enough.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.835
I was just thinking...

18:48.127 --> 18:50.170
The show's gonna move us all
into a hotel soon.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.797
We should be roomies.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.757
That sounds amazing.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.301
Guess that means
you're stuck with me, bud.

18:59.596 --> 19:00.514
[door creaks]

19:00.597 --> 19:02.266
-Spy much?
-[woman] Better him than Trip,

19:02.349 --> 19:03.725
that psycho freak of nature.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.353
If Tina finds out, she will claw me
to death behind the dance studio.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.063
[gasps]

19:08.605 --> 19:09.481
Are you okay?

19:10.858 --> 19:12.359
I think the drink just went to my head.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.611
I need to use the ladies' room.
Can you come with?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.325
I had a vision.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.286
I think maybe I should switch brains.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.163
Please, God, yes.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.039
Gulliver and Lars were having an affair.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.042
Gulliver said if Tina found out,
she would beat him to death.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.377
Oh, I believe she would.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.672
But the cyanide was found in
the protein powder at Nancy's house.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.923
If I'm on Gulliver's brain,

19:35.007 --> 19:37.426
maybe I'll see Tina
confront Lars and Gulliver.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.553
Still, why would the killer--

19:39.636 --> 19:41.263
It's a hunch, Ravi.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.557
I thought if anyone would believe in me
it would be you.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.268
New brain it is.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.021
So, if Tina's our likely killer,

19:49.104 --> 19:51.023
once you're roommates,
you'll have easy access to her phone

19:51.106 --> 19:53.192
and the best part? No dancing.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.112
I thought the best part
was us spending time together.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.657
-Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.993
Perfect timing. I got another round.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.163
I just texted Miss Everly.
She said it's cool if we share a room.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.332
-We're good to go too.
-Amazing.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.500
When do we start rooming together?

20:10.584 --> 20:12.836
-Right after dress rehearsal.
-[coughs]

20:25.724 --> 20:27.768
Oh, hey. Hi.

20:28.143 --> 20:31.438
Uh, I was just dropping off
the case files from

20:31.521 --> 20:32.648
the Leski investigation.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.067
The Leski investigation that closed
over a year ago?

20:35.567 --> 20:36.401
Mmm-hmm.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.445
We've been looking for those.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.039
Is the baby mine?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.670
You know, it's every girl's dream to have
a terrified guy ask her that.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.422
-I'm sorry.
-The truth is...

20:58.340 --> 20:59.341
I don't know.

20:59.633 --> 21:03.845
After you ended things,
I may have been a little reactive.

21:04.054 --> 21:08.684
Made a couple of bad choices.
My ex-boyfriend, Shane, being one of them.

21:09.309 --> 21:12.145
He's out of the picture.
Like, Cleveland out of the picture.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.148
I'm not sure which one
of you is the father.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.568
Not sure it even matters.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.737
It-- It matters to me.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.618
How would you feel
about getting a DNA test?

21:27.869 --> 21:29.997
No. Sorry.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.124
Those add unnecessary risks
to a pregnancy.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.750
Of course.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.503
Look...

21:38.714 --> 21:41.758
I know having this
hanging out there isn't great.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.136
You'll know when I know. I promise.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.851
-[salsa music playing on laptop]
-No.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.645
No, no, no, no.

21:54.896 --> 21:58.025
I cannot think of what to make.
I kind of want sweet.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.986
There's no way I can learn
Gulliver and Nancy's routine.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.571
I probably already know it, right?

22:03.405 --> 22:05.782
Do you remember
if I like lemon meringue pie?

22:06.033 --> 22:08.452
I have needs too, you know.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.538
I can't just give and give and give.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.501
A blintz?

22:17.919 --> 22:21.214
Oh, my God, I love you.
That is exactly what I want.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.886
[sighs]

22:27.512 --> 22:29.306
-Go, cat! Go!
-[shuts laptop]

22:31.183 --> 22:32.476
Tell me you solved the case.

22:32.559 --> 22:36.897
Not yet. I'm looking into this
"freak of nature" ex from Liv's vision.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.149
In the meantime,
Tina's phone would be helpful.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.402
[stammers] There is no way I can do this.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.362
I don't have the time.
I don't have the skill.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.280
[door opens]

22:45.655 --> 22:47.866
You don't need skills or time.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.702
You're Ravi Chakrabarti
and you're amazing.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.289
I brought you your dancing shoes.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.083
More comfortable pants.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.209
I can't kick in these.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.127
Which is why I also brought these...

23:00.212 --> 23:01.630
A bit of protein.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.757
Plus, some caffeine.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.384
Here's a reason not to freak out.

23:06.968 --> 23:11.348
In salsa dancing, the woman
is the picture and the guy is the frame.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.017
You just have to be the frame.

23:16.061 --> 23:16.895
The frame?

23:18.980 --> 23:23.193
And front and together. Back and together.

23:23.568 --> 23:26.446
Front and together. Back and together.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.032
I'm a really bad frame.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.451
You know, it might be easier if he counts.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.745
It's one, two, three...

23:33.829 --> 23:35.122
Five, six, seven.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.498
In salsa, you hold the four and the eight.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.750
-What do you mean, hold them?
-Oh, it's more like you drop them.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.168
I don't know what either of those mean.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.337
Ravi, just watch for a minute.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.674
[salsa music playing]

23:56.226 --> 23:59.604
This might be weird,
but I think Clive just got me pregnant.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.774
Let's not joke about that right now.

24:04.985 --> 24:05.902
Okay.

24:06.361 --> 24:09.322
And one, two, three.

24:09.489 --> 24:10.907
Five, six, seven.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.701
One, two, three.

24:12.784 --> 24:13.869
Five, six, seven.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.789
-Forward and close. Back and close.
-One, two, three. Five, six, seven.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.457
-Forward and close.
-One, two, three.

24:19.541 --> 24:23.461
The music goes in through your ears
and out through your hips.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.548
Is this really the best use of my time?

24:29.551 --> 24:31.136
[retro disco song playing]

26:30.171 --> 26:31.131
[laughing]

26:31.506 --> 26:34.634
-Yes.
-Yes!

26:35.760 --> 26:36.803
[music stops]

26:39.556 --> 26:40.432
Hey.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.892
[Ravi panting]

26:43.685 --> 26:49.232
Just wondering if you had
any new information on my John Doe.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.442
Yeah.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.861
He was murdered.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.242
Broken blood vessels in the eyes,
crushed windpipe

26:59.326 --> 27:01.161
would suggest strangulation
by someone very strong

27:01.786 --> 27:02.746
with large hands.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.081
Cool.

27:06.666 --> 27:07.542
Thanks.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.131
-I did the lift!
-You did the lift!

27:13.214 --> 27:14.841
[all laughing]

27:21.264 --> 27:22.349
Where are you off to?

27:22.807 --> 27:24.559
Mike Lice-an.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.937
Special ZED.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.231
[kids laughing]

27:37.864 --> 27:39.824
I see dead people.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.576
[laughs]

27:42.452 --> 27:43.620
[laughter continues]

27:45.080 --> 27:46.122
[snarls]

27:46.873 --> 27:51.086
Ma'am, any assignments were made
for purely academic reasons.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.922
Well, I've spoken to the parents
of the kids who you reassigned.

27:54.297 --> 27:57.550
Solid C students who were suddenly
in the "Gifted and Talented" program.

27:57.634 --> 28:01.012
No, your lice checks were really a method
by which you screen for,

28:01.096 --> 28:03.098
and then segregate zombie students.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.225
That's illegal in Seattle,
which you know.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.435
So, if you're interested
in keeping your job,

28:07.519 --> 28:09.729
you'll put those students
back in their original classrooms

28:09.813 --> 28:11.940
-by the end of the day.
-[students screaming]

28:17.237 --> 28:18.363
[snarling]

28:20.740 --> 28:23.076
Leave me alone or I'll kill you!
You hear me?

28:25.036 --> 28:26.955
Humans are the real monsters!

28:28.373 --> 28:29.791
All of you!

28:37.090 --> 28:39.926
Do you understand that this office is
still limited to the confines of the law?

28:40.135 --> 28:42.887
Yeah, well, I'd like to ride
a lollipop horse down gumdrop mountain,

28:42.971 --> 28:45.181
but I keep those expectations to myself.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.811
But the difference between us
is that I'm actually representing

28:49.894 --> 28:52.105
the rights of every citizen in this city.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.483
I don't know why you guys aren't happier.

28:55.859 --> 28:56.985
It's super fun in here.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.988
-You're Major Lillywhite.
-I am.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.364
I wanna join Fillmore Graves.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.533
Well, you're a little young.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.368
Maybe wait a couple years?

29:05.660 --> 29:06.536
I don't wanna wait.

29:06.703 --> 29:07.662
Why's that?

29:07.954 --> 29:09.664
I wanna start killing humans now.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.125
You do that. Looking forward to it.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.171
-Major?
-Yeah.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.299
Thanks for, um, coming over.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.593
I was planning on dropping by anyway.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.136
I didn't like how we left things.

29:23.636 --> 29:24.596
Yeah. Me neither.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.182
I've got so much crap raining down on me.

29:27.265 --> 29:30.685
I may have let myself think
that I was the only one in Seattle

29:30.769 --> 29:31.811
who had a tough job.

29:31.895 --> 29:32.854
[snickers]

29:33.062 --> 29:34.314
I'm sorry about that.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.149
I'm sorry, too.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.902
And you were right about my constituency.

29:38.985 --> 29:40.945
They are bald-faced liars.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.364
Their lice check was a zombie check.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.493
I went down to the school
to tear the principal a new one--

29:46.576 --> 29:47.535
Hell, yeah.

29:48.077 --> 29:49.204
I witnessed a fight,

29:49.412 --> 29:52.540
and this young man here got into it
pretty bad with a human student.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.335
Raged out. That's why I wanted you
to come over here.

29:55.418 --> 29:57.086
-I'm not sure what I can--
-They're orphaned.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.049
Peyton, I can't--

30:01.132 --> 30:03.843
Their sister was the Fillmore Graves
soldier who was killed.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.014
They said you knew her,
but I didn't know if that was...

30:12.060 --> 30:13.061
Um...

30:13.937 --> 30:15.230
That means you're Michael.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.315
And you're Jalen.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.984
I knew Jordan very well.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.111
She was special to me.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.489
She talked about you guys all the time.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.410
I am so sorry for your loss.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.496
Yeah.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.207
So are we.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.886
There's a youth shelter
that takes zombies.

30:46.970 --> 30:47.929
No.

30:48.388 --> 30:49.514
That's no good.

30:50.598 --> 30:51.683
Agreed.

30:52.559 --> 30:53.685
They need someplace safe,

30:53.768 --> 30:55.812
preferably a loving
and nurturing environment.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.315
Any ideas?

31:02.443 --> 31:03.820
Everyone loved Gulliver.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.739
There's not a ton
of water polo players left in Seattle.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.534
Losing him was a blow on a lotta levels.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.661
Was there anyone on the team named "Trip"?

31:12.161 --> 31:13.496
It could have been a nickname maybe.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.164
"Trip"? No.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.417
Was there anything strange
about any of the players?

31:17.792 --> 31:21.170
Something that might make people
think of them as a "freak of nature"?

31:21.629 --> 31:23.089
I heard one of the guys
could milk himself.

31:23.506 --> 31:24.674
I'm not sure which one.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.634
I have a team photo with a roster.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.471
[Clive] What about this Sasquatch-guy?

31:30.555 --> 31:31.389
Maybe.

31:31.681 --> 31:32.807
[Clive] Trip. Number three. This guy.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.767
-Was he a freak in some way?
-Harris?

31:34.934 --> 31:36.102
He can hold his breath forever.

31:36.185 --> 31:37.395
[footsteps approach]

31:42.025 --> 31:44.903
-Do you mind emailing me that photo?
-Yeah.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.492
-How you feeling?
-Did you ask her again?

31:55.955 --> 31:58.541
[sighs] I'm sorry. I can't do it.

31:58.708 --> 31:59.542
Fine.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.294
I'll do it.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.129
Dale, we're asking her to get the test,

32:03.212 --> 32:05.089
because we're hoping the baby isn't mine.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.926
I think that just doesn't feel right.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.638
We're surrounded by people
who are so excited

32:11.721 --> 32:12.972
that we're having a baby.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.557
She's got no one.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.066
I'm doing my best here, Clive.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.194
I know.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.575
[salsa music playing]

32:50.551 --> 32:52.261
You are the prettiest one here.

32:52.470 --> 32:55.640
Oh, my God!

33:00.853 --> 33:02.981
I know. They're the worst of the bunch.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.607
I don't even know how they got in.

33:05.858 --> 33:08.027
-I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.
-Can you not leave me?

33:08.319 --> 33:10.238
-Please?
-Hey, I know you're freaking out,

33:10.321 --> 33:11.864
but remember, we don't have to win.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.658
We just have to look competent.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.077
Do you think I'm worried
about not winning?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.413
-Ravi, this is your moment.
-[scoffs]

33:18.496 --> 33:21.708
It's gonna be just like
in the movies, except better.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.711
Because you're not dancing
to win child support money,

33:24.794 --> 33:27.380
or because your friend
is throwing an outlaw prom.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.925
And you're not dancing to say,
"Hey, Dad, I'm a woman now!

33:31.009 --> 33:33.845
I'm sick of this repressive
1960s paternalism!"

33:34.053 --> 33:36.305
You are dancing for justice.

33:36.389 --> 33:39.350
[woman] Next we have Jake and Juliette.

33:39.726 --> 33:40.935
Hey, look at me.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.939
Nobody puts Ravi in a corner.

33:47.483 --> 33:49.110
[dance music playing]

34:00.204 --> 34:01.914
Let the music take control.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.208
Let the rhythm move you.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.253
Are you really quoting
C+C Music Factory right now?

34:35.323 --> 34:36.491
[inaudible]

34:50.213 --> 34:52.882
Don't leave me.
She doesn't care about your happiness.

34:52.965 --> 34:54.509
She only cares about her own.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.718
She'll ruin your life.

35:21.786 --> 35:22.995
[music ends]

35:24.622 --> 35:25.456
[woman] Thank you.

35:25.873 --> 35:28.167
-Jake and Juliette.
-I saw a guy, had to be a boyfriend.

35:28.835 --> 35:31.254
He was saying that Nancy
would ruin Gulliver's life.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.756
-He was desperate.
-Here's Gulliver's water polo team.

35:34.006 --> 35:36.926
See, I thought it could be
this freak of nature tall guy.

35:37.009 --> 35:39.053
Or look how hairy that guy is.

35:40.513 --> 35:41.389
That's the guy.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.141
-That one?
-Yeah.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.809
How is he a freak of nature?

35:46.894 --> 35:48.771
Third nipple. Triple nipple. "Trip."

35:49.897 --> 35:51.566
You see how amazing you are?

35:52.859 --> 35:54.443
I thought it was a mole.

36:00.908 --> 36:01.784
Renaldo Sulvain?

36:02.201 --> 36:05.204
We were hoping to talk to you
about Gulliver Marlowe and Nancy Duvall.

36:05.663 --> 36:08.207
Of course. Please, come in.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.378
Can I get you anything to drink?

36:12.795 --> 36:14.297
[Clive] Oh, we're okay. Thank you.

36:17.967 --> 36:20.261
Can you tell us about
your relationship with Gulliver?

36:20.970 --> 36:22.138
It was amazing.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.808
Right up until that
possessive bitch broke us up.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.061
-Nancy, you mean?
-She didn't care about him.

36:29.145 --> 36:32.190
I thought he'd eventually see the way
she was taking advantage of him

36:32.273 --> 36:33.649
and he'd come back to me.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.109
But he never did.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.698
I never meant to hurt Gulliver.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.326
I just wanted Nancy out of the way.

36:43.743 --> 36:44.577
[coughs]

36:45.119 --> 36:46.621
She was awful.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.456
[coughs and gasps]

36:51.000 --> 36:51.834
Oh, my God.

36:52.335 --> 36:53.377
[Renaldo choking]

36:53.461 --> 36:54.337
I'm calling it in.

36:55.588 --> 36:58.382
-Renaldo? Renaldo?
-We need an ambulance right away

36:58.507 --> 36:59.842
-at 2241 Wilcher Place.
-What did you take?

37:00.218 --> 37:02.178
Adult male. No, Wilcher with a CH.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.389
-W-I-L-C-H-E-R.
-Clive!

37:12.730 --> 37:13.773
[camera shutter clicks]

37:17.193 --> 37:19.237
Cyanide. There was nothing
you could've done.

37:23.824 --> 37:27.119
I was on my way home from an event

37:27.453 --> 37:29.121
when I got the call, so...

37:31.249 --> 37:34.001
And you didn't change before you left
the dance studio, because--

37:34.085 --> 37:36.879
I stayed to watch the other dancers.

37:37.171 --> 37:38.047
As one does.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.259
Oh, man. I am so late. I gotta go.

37:41.801 --> 37:42.927
-You good?
-Yeah.

37:47.932 --> 37:48.766
Did we win?

37:51.769 --> 37:52.812
[both chuckle]

37:53.854 --> 37:57.692
[doula] Today, I'd like to talk about
how to support your partner

37:57.775 --> 38:00.194
when things get a bit scary.

38:00.903 --> 38:01.737
[door opens]

38:04.782 --> 38:06.117
On your own again, huh?

38:07.368 --> 38:08.286
Yep.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.788
You should really settle
on a birthing partner.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.623
You think I have a menu of options?

38:12.707 --> 38:13.833
I just haven't selected one yet?

38:18.004 --> 38:18.921
[sighs]

38:19.380 --> 38:20.214
Michelle.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.345
Let's... You and me.

38:29.348 --> 38:33.352
The birthing partner I found
on Snapchat got stuck at work late, so...

38:37.940 --> 38:40.234
[doula] Great. Okay, moms.

38:40.318 --> 38:45.698
Birthing partners are behind you,
supporting you as you lean on the ball.

38:45.781 --> 38:47.241
Dad or mom? Your call.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.412
You should be dad.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.833
You're being a very good source
of light and love right now.

38:57.626 --> 39:00.838
[doula] Okay, let's do
some deep belly breathing.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.548
[somber song playing]

39:15.895 --> 39:17.104
[mouthing] I love you.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.649
[mouthing] You better.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.740
[Stan] I'll never forget
Baron's first words to me.

39:30.242 --> 39:34.413
"Go back to college, White Boy.
This work is for real men."

39:34.497 --> 39:35.539
[men laughing]

39:36.916 --> 39:38.667
But once you got
to know him, you realized,

39:39.126 --> 39:40.544
this guy's a marshmallow.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.923
Like this one time, he insisted on
taking me out shopping for a first date.

39:44.131 --> 39:48.427
We went downtown
and all he picked out was a black beanie.

39:49.095 --> 39:50.596
He told me it'd give me
a bit of a rough edge.

39:50.679 --> 39:51.972
-Hey, Liv.
-Hey.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.392
Sorry for the surprise visit.
Something came up.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.435
I see that.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.062
Hey, Liv. Uh...

39:58.521 --> 40:02.108
Michael, Jalen, why don't you guys go
take a seat by the other kids?

40:02.400 --> 40:03.651
[song continues playing]

40:05.778 --> 40:06.987
[Liv] Who are they?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.572
Orphan zombies.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.741
[Major] Their sister was in my squad.

40:11.158 --> 40:12.410
And she can't care for them?

40:13.702 --> 40:15.830
She was killed by a sniper.

40:21.877 --> 40:24.338
Uh, well, we have plenty of room upstairs.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.133
This place has sort of become
an accidental orphanage.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.593
No, no, Liv.
We weren't trying to put this on you.

40:29.677 --> 40:30.845
We were just looking for advice.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.347
My advice is leave them with me.

40:51.490 --> 40:53.909
-So, who died?
-[Oliver] This guy, Baron.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.163
He was the coyote that brought us here.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.040
He died saving our lives.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.252
We saw him take five bullets to the chest.

41:04.753 --> 41:05.963
That shouldn't kill him.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.465
Kills most humans.

41:08.257 --> 41:09.341
He was a human?

41:10.009 --> 41:11.010
Yeah.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.511
All coyotes are human.

41:14.346 --> 41:15.598

41:29.445 --> 41:30.279

41:33.324 --> 41:35.326
