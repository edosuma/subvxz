01:15.770 --> 01:17.681
Look at it, Jefferson.

01:17.890 --> 01:21.769
The elegance, the form,
the sheer grace of motion.

01:21.970 --> 01:24.643
The triumph of the human spirit.

01:24.850 --> 01:28.081
<i>And now, on Monster Trucking:</i>

01:29.450 --> 01:35.320
<i>Tyrannosaurus Wreck will attempt
to mow over nine flaming prison buses.</i>

01:36.410 --> 01:41.723
Boy, PBS has really changed
since the Republicans took over.

01:42.850 --> 01:44.408
Hey.

01:49.250 --> 01:51.161
- Mail's here.
- What'd we get?

01:51.370 --> 01:54.089
Well, you've got bills.

01:54.730 --> 01:56.766
I got fan mail.

01:57.690 --> 02:00.045
Oh, and I think we all know
what little handyman...

02:00.290 --> 02:01.882
<i>...gets Self Touchers Quarterly.</i>

02:04.730 --> 02:06.800
And this is for you.

02:07.170 --> 02:12.449
Oh, a letter from
the Office of Bingo Affairs.

02:12.690 --> 02:15.045
No doubt a part
of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco...

02:15.250 --> 02:17.844
...and Useless
Blood-Sucking Spouses.

02:19.650 --> 02:25.008
Al, I have been invited
to the Windy City Bingo Invitational.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.962
You know what this means?

02:27.170 --> 02:29.843
The couch is in danger
of flying away?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.164
This is the World Series of bingo.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.567
Top prize is $10,000.

02:36.810 --> 02:38.528
Well, I think it's exciting, Peggy.

02:38.770 --> 02:41.045
So you'll come to the tournament
with me?

02:41.250 --> 02:44.401
Oh, well, I would...

02:44.610 --> 02:49.365
...but I can't. You see, bingo
brings up sad memories for me.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.528
I had a dog named Bingo once...

02:53.050 --> 02:55.883
...who died a tragic death.

02:56.250 --> 02:59.162
I thought you had a cat named Gringo
that lived to be a hundred.

03:02.890 --> 03:05.358
Well, then I guess I can go.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.805
Thank you so much, honey pot.

03:08.050 --> 03:12.760
Peggy, do I have time to go home
and freshen up and amend my will?

03:13.370 --> 03:16.521
Sure. The tournament
isn't until next Tuesday.

03:16.770 --> 03:20.558
Don't worry, Al, this isn't
gonna cost you one red cent.

03:20.810 --> 03:22.038
Good.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.366
Give me $300.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.478
What for?

03:26.690 --> 03:28.442
- Bingo clothes.
- You--

03:30.970 --> 03:33.245
Here, you Denver boot of a woman.

03:36.690 --> 03:38.408
Hey, Peg, don't forget about dinner.

03:39.130 --> 03:42.167
Steak? Sounds great. Thank you.

03:43.370 --> 03:47.602
Bingo invitational.
Jeez, the things that excite women.

03:47.850 --> 03:52.799
<i>And now a word from our sponsor,
Girlie Girl Beer.</i>

03:55.210 --> 03:57.519
The official beer of NO MA'AM.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.159
I hope this where
the girls are washing their cars...

04:00.370 --> 04:02.247
...and they turn their hoses
on each other.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.725
I hope it's the one
where the girls are studying...

04:04.930 --> 04:07.398
...and then they turn the hoses
on each other.

04:08.970 --> 04:12.724
<i>Hi, I'm Yoko Ono...</i>

04:13.130 --> 04:17.281
<i>...the new spokeshuman
for Girlie Girl Beer.</i>

04:18.170 --> 04:21.367
<i>Because we care
about the environment...</i>

04:21.570 --> 04:25.324
<i>...Girlie Girl Beer will donate
one nickel per case...</i>

04:25.530 --> 04:28.522
<i>...to save our vanishing rain forests.</i>

04:28.730 --> 04:33.599
<i>And now, a song I've written.</i>

04:35.650 --> 04:37.527
Jefferson, give me the remote.

04:54.010 --> 04:56.080
It wasn't enough breaking up
the Beatles.

04:56.290 --> 04:58.679
Now she's ruined our beer.

04:58.930 --> 05:01.569
Jefferson, call an emergency meeting
of the troops.

05:01.810 --> 05:05.598
NO MA'AM must pick a
new official beer.

05:26.130 --> 05:27.483
What's going on in the garage?

05:27.690 --> 05:33.162
Your father and the flab four are trying
to come up with a new official beer.

05:33.410 --> 05:36.641
You mean they finished their search
for the official pork rind?

05:37.970 --> 05:39.562
Peg?

05:43.010 --> 05:46.685
We need something to cleanse
the palate between beers.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.763
Have you tried toothpaste?

05:50.010 --> 05:53.923
No, Peg. Toothpaste is for people
who kiss, smile or eat.

05:54.690 --> 05:57.762
Well, if you kissed, you might eat.

05:58.850 --> 06:01.045
Yeah, but I wouldn't smile.

06:03.610 --> 06:06.647
"Do not sell after 1989."

06:11.210 --> 06:13.565
Hell, I'm not selling, I'm eating.

06:15.010 --> 06:17.240
Hey, listen, Dad.

06:17.490 --> 06:19.162
As an outsider of NO MA'AM...

06:19.530 --> 06:21.805
...and if there's a God, this family...

06:22.010 --> 06:25.320
...why do a bunch of guys who are bleary
when sober need an official beer?

06:25.530 --> 06:27.088
Bud.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.890
While NO MA'AM
may look like a loose assortment...

06:30.090 --> 06:32.843
...of foot pads, rakes
and rapscallions...

06:33.050 --> 06:36.599
...we are, in fact,
a proud order of dignified men...

06:36.810 --> 06:40.723
...who serve our community
with honor and panache.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.161
Hey, Al. Come quick.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.565
Ike's got an atomic fireball
stuck up his nose!

06:45.770 --> 06:50.560
Again? Didn't he learn his lesson
from the corn dog?

06:51.250 --> 06:53.127
- Get the video camera.
- And the Dirt Devil?

06:53.330 --> 06:55.161
No, she's reading.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.321
Al.

07:00.010 --> 07:03.764
Just how long are you guys gonna be
Jim Carreying around in there?

07:04.010 --> 07:05.682
I need a ride
to the bingo tournament.

07:05.930 --> 07:09.127
No, Peg. We're picking a beer.

07:09.370 --> 07:13.045
Can't you hitch a ride
on Marcie's poultry wagon?

07:13.930 --> 07:16.649
Al, the church is in
a very dangerous neighborhood.

07:16.890 --> 07:19.802
What could happen, Peg,
a drive-by plucking?

07:20.610 --> 07:22.168
Fine. Then don't take me.

07:22.370 --> 07:24.964
But I'm gonna just bust up
your little beer party here...

07:25.210 --> 07:27.360
...and ask some stupid questions
about sports.

07:27.610 --> 07:30.443
Oh, get in the car, Peg.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.365
And don't forget.
You gotta pick me up at 9:00.

07:33.570 --> 07:37.040
- Fine.
- Al! Look!

07:39.690 --> 07:41.601
We've got British ale.

07:41.850 --> 07:45.445
Men, don't forget.
British ale must be served warm.

07:54.890 --> 07:56.926
This is charming, Peggy.

07:57.130 --> 07:58.722
Thanks for inviting me.

07:58.930 --> 08:02.889
And the women are wearing
my favorite scent: dust.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.844
Oh, just relax, Marcie.
This is gonna be fun.

08:06.090 --> 08:09.480
Sit down and soak up the ambiance.

08:13.610 --> 08:17.967
There is now an open chair
at table nine.

08:24.730 --> 08:27.881
Maybe I'll just play
with one of these.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.289
Touch that marker...

08:30.490 --> 08:33.799
...and you're gonna be eating
through a straw like the rest of us.

08:35.809 --> 08:37.926
Oh, well...

08:38.169 --> 08:43.119
...I guess I'll just sit here
until Al comes to pick us up...

08:43.809 --> 08:46.165
...seven hours from now.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.038
Squeak that chair one more time...

08:52.250 --> 08:55.879
...and you'll wish you were never born
like the rest of us!

08:58.610 --> 09:00.805
I-28.

09:05.450 --> 09:10.922
Peggy, I'm feeling a little
uncomfortable around Brunhilda here.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.527
Oh, that's just Ceil.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.806
She's really nice
once you get to know her.

09:16.010 --> 09:17.648
Offer her a potato chip.

09:17.850 --> 09:21.081
G-57.

09:21.610 --> 09:23.043
Would you like a chip?

09:37.330 --> 09:38.649
Back to business.

09:39.450 --> 09:43.966
Beer will be judged by nose,
body, taste and color of exit.

09:46.730 --> 09:49.961
And remember, no drinking.

09:50.170 --> 09:53.719
We will sip, swish and spit.

09:54.890 --> 09:58.246
I'll sip and spit,
but I ain't gonna swish.

09:59.610 --> 10:01.965
You'll swish and like it.

10:02.610 --> 10:05.363
We will now commence with
the official NO MA'AM beer tasting.

10:05.610 --> 10:09.205
Jefferson, would you do
the honors, please?

10:09.530 --> 10:11.919
Gladly.

10:12.210 --> 10:15.839
Now, our first candidate
comes from Asia Minor...

10:16.050 --> 10:20.362
...is made from agave
and bladderwort.

10:40.050 --> 10:41.768
All right.

10:43.090 --> 10:47.163
Our next beer is a fine Afghani ale...

10:47.690 --> 10:52.525
...whose name loosely translated
means "yellow mountain runoff."

10:55.370 --> 10:57.247
Oh, hey, look.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.645
There's a prize in every can.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.563
I'd be careful about that prize stuff.

11:02.770 --> 11:05.762
Remember what fell out
of that Chernobyl beer.

11:08.810 --> 11:12.689
What? That was an olive, right?

11:15.650 --> 11:17.322
Sure, with an eyebrow.

11:19.290 --> 11:21.758
All right, all right, all right, all right.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.683
Let's forget about
this wimpy foreign beer.

11:24.890 --> 11:27.450
We're Americans.
Let's drink American.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.805
What's our first American beer?

11:31.290 --> 11:32.723
Dos Equis!

11:38.810 --> 11:41.882
N-41.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.640
Peggy, I don't think
I can sit here any longer.

11:46.850 --> 11:48.886
Shut up.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.165
Just relax, Marcie.
This is the last game.

11:53.370 --> 11:56.168
Whoever wins this one
gets the big jackpot.

11:56.410 --> 11:58.287
Shut up!

11:59.330 --> 12:02.606
G-58.

12:05.690 --> 12:08.568
Look, Peggy, all you need
is one more square.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.285
Yeah. But I never win anything.
I just play for fun.

12:12.490 --> 12:15.641
N-33.

12:15.890 --> 12:18.324
Bingo! Bingo!

12:18.570 --> 12:21.687
Oh, my God, bingo!

12:23.330 --> 12:25.127
Congratulations, Peggy!

12:25.370 --> 12:27.281
Shut up!

12:28.650 --> 12:32.609
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner of the $10,000 grand prize...

12:32.850 --> 12:35.045
...Mrs. Peggy Bundy.

12:39.690 --> 12:43.569
Oh, Peggy, what are you gonna do
with $10,000?

12:43.810 --> 12:46.324
Well, I think I'll give it to the needy.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.725
Of course, I "needy" it all.

12:52.130 --> 12:55.247
It's 9:00.
Al should be pulling up soon.

13:02.890 --> 13:04.926
Wait, Al, look it's 9:00.

13:05.130 --> 13:08.327
When are we gonna stop sipping
and start drinking some of this stuff?

13:08.570 --> 13:12.722
Yeah, all this beer foreplay
is making me thirsty.

13:13.610 --> 13:15.521
What's foreplay?

13:17.330 --> 13:19.685
About 10 seconds.

13:21.970 --> 13:23.198
Then what's sex?

13:27.210 --> 13:30.805
All right, men. Focus, men, focus.

13:31.290 --> 13:34.407
All right, from now on
we'll each drink a little beer.

13:34.610 --> 13:38.125
But remember,
we must still show decorum.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.680
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Pamela Anderson.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.848
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Pamela Anderson.

13:50.850 --> 13:52.966
What is the problem?

13:53.170 --> 13:56.560
You guys haven't thrown
a frigging punch.

13:57.930 --> 14:01.445
Hey, Al. I don't wanna box anymore.

14:01.690 --> 14:04.443
Let's dance.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.970
When you were dancing,
you wanted to box.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.644
Oh, but-- But when I was dancing...

14:10.850 --> 14:13.205
...I didn't get to lead.

14:15.730 --> 14:19.040
Get out there, you big happy boy.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.727
Hey, Jefferson, I got a bad feeling.

14:26.930 --> 14:29.285
Well, heck, you had about 40 beers.

14:29.490 --> 14:31.720
It's-- It's a wonder
you can feel anything.

14:31.970 --> 14:37.681
No, I think I was supposed
to do something around 9:00.

14:38.410 --> 14:39.638
What time is it?

14:41.530 --> 14:45.842
- It's 10:15.
- Oh, then I probably already done it.

14:47.730 --> 14:52.201
Hey, Bob Rooney. Go to the kidneys.
Go to the kidneys.

14:52.730 --> 14:56.359
Go to the bathroom.
Go to the bathroom.

15:04.690 --> 15:07.568
Well, staying true
to his performance in bed...

15:07.810 --> 15:12.167
...I think it's safe to say
that Al has let me down again.

15:13.090 --> 15:14.967
Unfortunately, in this case...

15:15.170 --> 15:18.242
...I can't just reach into the night stand
and get myself home.

15:24.210 --> 15:27.600
Well, thank goodness
we're in the comfort of a church.

15:27.850 --> 15:30.523
Ladies, I gotta lock up. Get out.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.088
I thought this was a sanctuary.

15:33.330 --> 15:37.369
Yeah, until 11. After that,
it's just another crime scene.

15:38.290 --> 15:41.088
You don't understand.
We don't have a ride home...

15:41.330 --> 15:43.366
...and we're carrying
$10,000 in cash.

15:43.570 --> 15:46.721
Now, if you make us leave, there's
no telling what will happen to us.

15:46.930 --> 15:50.002
Oh, I know exactly
what would happen to you.

15:50.850 --> 15:55.241
But luckily, doctors today
can reattach almost anything.

15:56.170 --> 15:58.320
Take me.
Would you believe this isn't my real--?

15:58.570 --> 16:01.721
Peggy! I think we should call a cab.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.128
You'll never get a cab
this time of night.

16:06.650 --> 16:08.208
You could get one in the morning...

16:08.450 --> 16:10.964
...if you wouldn't mind shacking up
with me.

16:12.010 --> 16:16.606
I got a hot plate
and some macaroni and cheese.

16:17.770 --> 16:18.998
Marcie?

16:20.970 --> 16:23.279
Look, dream date.

16:24.570 --> 16:27.130
There's gotta be another way
out of here.

16:27.370 --> 16:30.999
There is one other way.
My cousin Elmo drives a gypsy cab.

16:31.210 --> 16:34.566
He can come and get you for $200.

16:35.010 --> 16:38.685
I can't believe you are ripping us off
in a sacred place.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.482
God is gonna get you.

16:41.410 --> 16:44.641
Yeah, there's so much more
he can take from me.

16:46.370 --> 16:52.127
Well, we are not paying $200 for a cab,
you cave-dwelling pirate.

16:52.330 --> 16:54.605
Suit yourself, bucko.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.161
Sorry for the bumpy ride.

17:09.369 --> 17:12.646
It's hard to steer
when you're coming off drugs.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.884
Hey, watch out!

17:17.569 --> 17:19.640
Damn jogger.

17:21.410 --> 17:24.402
Don't you think
you should turn your headlights on?

17:24.609 --> 17:28.888
Nope, but feel free to turn on yours.

17:30.570 --> 17:33.642
I should report him. What's his name?

17:34.410 --> 17:37.641
"Dan Rostenkowski"?

17:42.810 --> 17:43.765
Why are you stopping?

17:43.970 --> 17:46.882
Well, you see this thing here
on my leg?

17:47.130 --> 17:49.724
I go two more blocks,
I'll violate my parole...

17:49.930 --> 17:52.239
...we all explode together.

17:52.890 --> 17:54.881
Which is something
I've been hankering for...

17:55.090 --> 17:58.719
...since you two hot mamas
slid into my cab.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.680
- I think we'll just get out here.
- Fine.

18:01.890 --> 18:04.882
My buddy Abdula
will take you the rest of the way.

18:08.530 --> 18:12.159
I find driving to be
a really Zen experience.

18:12.690 --> 18:16.080
I think the faster you go,
the faster you get there.

18:17.010 --> 18:21.800
I never knew a Geo Metro
could go 140 miles an hour.

18:23.010 --> 18:27.049
Yeah. They corner great too. Watch.

18:32.170 --> 18:35.242
What a relief to be in a normal cab.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.128
You seem like a nice person.

18:37.330 --> 18:39.890
Well, I love my work.

18:40.850 --> 18:45.207
- How long have you been driving?
- Seventy-two hours... straight.

18:47.090 --> 18:49.888
Driving's helped me forget about
the two-timing dirty dog...

18:50.090 --> 18:52.684
...who left me and took everything.

18:53.690 --> 18:56.523
I'll have the last laugh
when he finds out I wrapped his cab...

18:56.730 --> 18:59.449
...around a telephone pole,
wearing his favorite shirt.

19:00.610 --> 19:04.239
I got your,
"She was only making the bed."

19:23.170 --> 19:26.048
So where's Dad
and the rest of the lawn sprinklers?

19:27.130 --> 19:30.566
Well, the last time I saw,
Buck was giving them all sleigh rides.

19:34.490 --> 19:36.242
<i>The horror.</i>

19:36.450 --> 19:39.169
<i>The unspeakable horror.</i>

19:49.170 --> 19:52.845
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Tastes great.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.964
Oh, look, my children.

20:01.050 --> 20:04.440
What's-her-name and
Don't-worry-about-me-I'm-on-the-pill.

20:07.930 --> 20:09.682
Bud. Kelly.

20:09.890 --> 20:13.439
When your mother asks about this,
and she will...

20:13.690 --> 20:18.844
...you tell her we just tasted one beer
and went right to sheep.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.287
What if she asks
why you didn't pick up your wife?

20:23.530 --> 20:25.805
You just tell her
because she was too heavy.

20:34.570 --> 20:36.526
Hey, pookie.

20:37.650 --> 20:38.969
How was bingo?

20:39.170 --> 20:42.685
It was great, Al. I won the $10,000.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.081
Ten thousand dollars, Peg?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.558
Let me see it.

20:54.090 --> 20:55.967
This is only three bucks.

20:56.890 --> 20:59.882
Well, that's all we had left...

21:00.130 --> 21:05.045
...after fighting our way north
via the underground railroad!

21:06.810 --> 21:10.485
- Thank your father, kids.
- Thanks, Dad.

21:10.730 --> 21:13.483
All this for new official beer.

21:14.170 --> 21:16.559
That's what we forgot to do.

21:16.810 --> 21:18.721
Pick a new official beer.

21:20.890 --> 21:22.482
How about Girlie Girl?

21:22.730 --> 21:24.880
- Hear, hear!
- Good choice.

21:26.090 --> 21:28.524
Hey, boy, that was easy.

21:29.410 --> 21:30.968
Where were we?

21:31.170 --> 21:35.402
Hey, I know. You guys stay put.

21:35.650 --> 21:37.402
I'll be right back.

21:37.690 --> 21:40.727
Al, it's 9:00. Where are you going?

21:41.130 --> 21:44.122
Yeah. I gotta go pick up the wife.

21:45.305 --> 21:51.387
