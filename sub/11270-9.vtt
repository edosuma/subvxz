WEBVTT

00:04.040 --> 00:06.578
Everybody, step right in here.
Come on.

00:09.003 --> 00:11.838
This is the home of Paul Revere.

00:13.174 --> 00:18.761
- Looks like a bar to me.
- The Reveres liked to entertain.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.379
Walk around
and soak up some atmosphere.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.260
Give me a shot of bourbon.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.644
What's this all about?

00:27.772 --> 00:30.097
It's a walking tour of Boston.

00:30.233 --> 00:33.436
It's 30 degrees outside
and my feet are throbbing.

00:33.569 --> 00:36.191
Paul Revere's house
is nowhere near here.

00:37.407 --> 00:38.984
You wanna do this?

00:41.327 --> 00:46.534
I gotta fit in five more sites before
six o'clock. I'll never make it.

00:53.005 --> 00:58.592
We are also standing
on the Grainery burying ground,

00:58.719 --> 01:02.848
the Olde Corner Bookstore
and the Old North Church.

01:04.224 --> 01:07.060
Let's get going,
this is it for Boston.

01:07.186 --> 01:10.804
- That's the whole tour?
- Seemed to fly by, didn't it?

01:11.649 --> 01:16.607
<i>Bid a fond adieu to Boston,
the hub of New England.</i>

01:17.530 --> 01:19.819
I always thought
Boston was a lot bigger.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.025
It is in the summer.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

02:41.155 --> 02:43.112
Sure, sister, that'll be fine.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.651
You're welcome.

02:44.784 --> 02:46.527
I didn't know you had a sister.

02:46.660 --> 02:50.326
That's Sister Theresa
from St Matthias School for Girls.

02:50.456 --> 02:53.326
She's sending a student
over with a playbill.

02:53.459 --> 02:57.457
St Matthias is a good school. I've
had two kids thrown out of there.

02:59.173 --> 03:01.545
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

03:03.636 --> 03:06.969
- What's up, Norm?
- My nipples. It's freezing.

03:16.899 --> 03:21.062
So, how was your Sunday?
Catch the Celtics-75ers game?

03:21.195 --> 03:25.109
Yes, and the Bruins-Flyers,
the Ramos-Ramos fight.

03:25.241 --> 03:27.032
Australian rules football.

03:27.159 --> 03:31.287
Tomorrow, Boston College play lona.
Put that money down, pal.

03:31.413 --> 03:35.992
Doesn't your wife ever complain
you never spend time with her?

03:36.126 --> 03:37.669
Would you?

03:39.880 --> 03:44.922
What I can't fathom is how one can
drink cold beer in freezing weather.

03:45.052 --> 03:48.302
- Cliff? Explanation.
- How do you know he has one?

03:48.430 --> 03:51.680
Five bucks says he does,
ten says it's a doozy.

03:54.561 --> 03:58.476
- When the British ruled Punjab...
- Ten bucks all the way.

03:59.149 --> 04:02.649
.. they drank steaming hot tea
on the hottest days of the year

04:02.778 --> 04:05.565
to balance the inside
and outside temperatures.

04:05.698 --> 04:08.782
Conversely, drinking
an ice-cold drink on a cold day

04:08.909 --> 04:11.696
results in a more comfortable
body temperature.

04:11.829 --> 04:16.158
Alright. Why do you drink
ice-cold beer on a hot day?

04:16.291 --> 04:18.083
Mr Clavin?

04:19.043 --> 04:21.535
What else are you gonna do with it?

04:23.006 --> 04:26.838
I gotta get rid of a little now.
I'll be in the little boys' room.

04:26.969 --> 04:29.257
Hop on one leg, big boy.

04:29.388 --> 04:33.006
The pipes are clogged up again.
Nothing's working back there.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.181
Sorry. Go up to Melville's again.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.599
- Jacket in the same spot?
- Yeah.

04:37.729 --> 04:40.730
What a drag, having to dress up
to go to the john.

04:40.858 --> 04:43.183
Come on.

04:45.696 --> 04:47.605
You men have it easy.

04:47.739 --> 04:50.824
We have to wear taffeta
and have the correct change.

04:52.995 --> 04:55.201
Hey, that looks good.
Who's your tailor?

04:55.330 --> 04:58.165
Give me a break.
The sweater's a little bulky.

05:01.795 --> 05:03.835
Have a good time up there, Ollie.

05:05.299 --> 05:07.457
- I'm in the back with my pipes.
- Wait.

05:07.593 --> 05:10.262
- I've got an order.
- Carla's got the bar.

05:10.387 --> 05:12.296
That's right!

05:13.056 --> 05:16.971
OK, everybody! Carla's got the bar.

05:18.770 --> 05:23.017
You can have anything you want,
as long as it has no ice, straws,

05:23.150 --> 05:27.728
cherries, olives, mixer,
umbrellas, fruits or flames.

05:29.072 --> 05:31.065
An order.

05:33.618 --> 05:37.616
I need an old-fashioned,
a brandy Alexander and a martini.

05:37.748 --> 05:39.787
Three beers coming up.

05:44.963 --> 05:48.913
The damnedest thing. I've been
shivering all the way over here.

05:49.051 --> 05:52.087
Coach, you have no coat on,
it's 30 degrees outside.

05:52.220 --> 05:54.794
Thank God, I thought I had malaria.

05:59.394 --> 06:01.434
Are you alright?

06:01.563 --> 06:04.101
I don't know where my mind is today.

06:05.358 --> 06:08.941
I just remembered,
I left it at Nina's apartment.

06:09.529 --> 06:12.020
- Your mind?
- No, my coat.

06:13.408 --> 06:14.867
Who's Nina?

06:14.993 --> 06:19.038
A girl who moved into my building
today. I helped her move some stuff.

06:19.164 --> 06:22.782
It's the damnedest thing.
I kept wanting to smell her neck.

06:24.711 --> 06:26.253
To smell her neck?

06:26.379 --> 06:30.591
- It hit me what that's all about.
- Physical attraction?

06:30.717 --> 06:32.710
No, Lux.

06:34.346 --> 06:36.422
It used to be the soap of the stars.

06:37.974 --> 06:40.975
Don't say anything about this
to anybody, please.

06:41.102 --> 06:43.261
- Why?
- It's embarrassing.

06:43.396 --> 06:46.231
If you're my friend,
you won't say anything, OK?

06:46.358 --> 06:48.979
Coach, you're a normal, healthy man

06:49.110 --> 06:51.862
who's attracted to a woman.
What's wrong there?

06:51.988 --> 06:54.028
She's a lot younger than me.

06:54.157 --> 06:56.066
How much younger?

06:56.201 --> 07:00.613
You'll see, I told her where I work.
She might drop in after she unpacks.

07:00.747 --> 07:02.407
Hello.

07:05.377 --> 07:07.120
Hi, sweetheart.

07:07.253 --> 07:10.171
You're under arrest. Are you crazy?

07:11.257 --> 07:12.752
That's not her.

07:14.344 --> 07:18.176
- Come on in.
- I'm from St Matthias School.

07:18.306 --> 07:20.346
Sam said I could put a playbill up.

07:20.475 --> 07:22.931
- Good.
- What play are you doing?

07:23.728 --> 07:26.302
<i>It's a production
of Twelve Angry Men,</i>

07:26.439 --> 07:28.977
a taut, absorbing
psychological drama.

07:30.151 --> 07:32.642
<i>When I was your age,
we did Romeo and Juliet.</i>

07:32.779 --> 07:35.484
We were looking for something
with more meat.

07:36.658 --> 07:38.449
Thank you.

07:38.576 --> 07:41.281
You're welcome, honey.
I'll hang it up for you.

07:42.497 --> 07:45.830
- Hi, Ernie.
- Nina, hi. Welcome to Cheers.

07:45.959 --> 07:49.541
Boy, it's nice and warm in here.
My apartment is freezing.

07:49.671 --> 07:53.289
I hope it's OK, the super's gonna
call me here when the heat's on.

07:53.424 --> 07:57.090
It's a great idea.
Sit down, I'll show you the place.

07:57.887 --> 07:59.880
Have a seat. Now, let's see.

08:01.057 --> 08:03.180
This is the bar.

08:04.310 --> 08:07.762
Those are the bottles.
These are the glasses.

08:09.399 --> 08:12.353
That's a stool. Any questions?

08:13.611 --> 08:18.024
I've always wondered what gas you use
to pressurise those beer kegs.

08:18.283 --> 08:19.943
Probably unleaded.

08:22.495 --> 08:24.618
- Can I get you a drink?
- White wine.

08:24.747 --> 08:28.330
White wine. Diane, Nina. Nina, Diane.

08:28.459 --> 08:30.832
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

08:31.754 --> 08:34.921
Diane is very smart.
Say something very smart.

08:36.509 --> 08:38.798
<i>Tempus fugit.</i>

08:39.429 --> 08:42.346
- Coach, she's adorable.
- Isn't she?

08:44.434 --> 08:46.675
Carla, come over a minute, will you?

08:46.811 --> 08:48.851
I'm busy.

08:51.024 --> 08:54.439
Carla's been in a lousy mood
for the last two, three years.

08:55.820 --> 08:57.860
It's getting strange up there.

08:57.989 --> 09:01.192
That's Norm.
That's not Norm's jacket.

09:01.325 --> 09:04.825
- How do you mean, strange?
- That new men's room attendant.

09:04.954 --> 09:09.248
The guy hands me a towel, whisks me
off and invites me out to a movie.

09:11.669 --> 09:15.120
Guys, meet Nina.
She just moved into my place.

09:19.051 --> 09:22.551
No, not my apartment, my building.

09:23.055 --> 09:24.514
Crazy guys, but nice.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.641
I'd still be dragging my box spring
without Ernie.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.845
You're a dog, Coach.

09:33.858 --> 09:36.812
Honey, excuse me.
I gotta check the backroom.

09:36.944 --> 09:40.278
- That's it for me.
- That's Sam.

09:40.406 --> 09:42.778
He's handsome. He's a bit of a wolf.

09:43.576 --> 09:47.276
I don't know what to do.
Anyone know anything about plumbing?

09:47.413 --> 09:51.541
Well, the Romans had
an elaborate system of aqueducts.

09:53.127 --> 09:55.618
They were sort of
the forerunners of...

09:55.755 --> 09:59.503
Cliff. I need somebody
to help me fix the plumbing.

10:00.343 --> 10:02.584
Sorry, Sammy. Strictly theory.

10:05.139 --> 10:07.712
- Let me do it.
- Give me a break.

10:07.850 --> 10:10.222
Come on. I'm an expert at this stuff.

10:10.353 --> 10:12.725
I've got four kids and one bathroom.

10:12.855 --> 10:16.354
My kids gave me Drano
for Mother's Day.

10:16.484 --> 10:18.809
Give me that wrench.
I'm going in there.

10:18.944 --> 10:20.189
Go get them.

10:22.657 --> 10:24.696
Everybody out of the men's room.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.363
Why didn't you say that
before you came in?

10:29.955 --> 10:31.948
- Give me two beers.
- Excuse me.

10:33.501 --> 10:36.418
Sam! I know what you're going to do.

10:36.545 --> 10:39.914
I can't explain now.
Just stay away from that woman.

10:40.049 --> 10:42.006
What woman?

10:42.676 --> 10:44.753
Actually, I was going for a coffee.

10:44.887 --> 10:48.054
Thanks for pointing her out.
I must be slipping.

10:49.683 --> 10:53.847
Please, I can't tell you why,
but it's just not right.

10:55.606 --> 10:57.433
OK. Alright.

10:58.109 --> 10:59.519
If you insist.

11:06.450 --> 11:08.277
Wait a minute.

11:09.161 --> 11:11.831
I understand
something about psychology.

11:13.332 --> 11:17.330
By telling me not to go,
you're trying to get my curiosity up

11:17.503 --> 11:19.792
so I do exactly the opposite, right?

11:19.922 --> 11:21.582
Absolutely not.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.507
No!

11:24.718 --> 11:27.044
Probably a friend of yours?

11:27.179 --> 11:31.129
The two of you cooked something up
to make me look a silly fool?

11:31.267 --> 11:34.137
- I'm not going anywhere near her.
- Thank you.

11:34.812 --> 11:36.639
Thank you?

11:37.731 --> 11:40.483
That's what you wanted me to do,
walk away.

11:40.609 --> 11:43.314
- You don't want me going near her.
- No.

11:44.196 --> 11:48.941
No meaning yes. Listen, this is
my bar and I'll do what I want.

11:52.955 --> 11:54.579
Hi, there.

11:54.707 --> 11:55.786
Hi.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.992
You new in the neighbourhood?

11:58.127 --> 12:01.330
- Yeah, I'm new to Boston.
- How do you like it so far?

12:01.463 --> 12:04.797
- Fine, how do you like it?
- Much better now.

12:05.592 --> 12:10.420
Sorry about this stuff. I'm sat here
waiting for my heat to be turned on.

12:10.556 --> 12:12.679
How hot do you want it to get?

12:15.686 --> 12:17.678
I heard you were kind of a wolf.

12:18.188 --> 12:21.273
Howl at the moon one time,
they never let you forget it.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.733
Listen. While we're
on the subject of subgum,...

12:25.696 --> 12:29.147
.. how would you like
to go out to Chinese food later?

12:29.283 --> 12:31.608
No, thank you. I'd rather not.

12:32.995 --> 12:36.494
Did I make it clear I meant with me?

12:37.374 --> 12:38.833
Painfully.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.082
I think I like this girl.

12:45.299 --> 12:48.798
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go say goodbye to my bathroom.

12:50.095 --> 12:51.922
Congratulations, Diane.

12:53.015 --> 12:57.143
You and your friend made me look
a complete ass. I hope you're happy.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.725
- Couldn't have done it without you.
- Isn't she great?

13:02.900 --> 13:06.565
You know, Coach,
I think you should ask her out.

13:06.695 --> 13:08.320
Ask her out?

13:08.447 --> 13:12.907
I haven't asked a girl out in years.
I don't know if my old lines work.

13:13.035 --> 13:14.861
What was the last one you used?

13:16.580 --> 13:19.664
"How would you like
a pair of nylons, Fräulein?"

13:24.922 --> 13:27.875
- Probably not.
- Come on. It worked.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.756
What do we need it for?
It's just another piece to clog up.

13:31.887 --> 13:33.547
It's belongs to something.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.302
Don't hang on to things
through sentiment.

13:40.062 --> 13:44.190
Coach, how about all the women
you talk about in your baseball days?

13:44.316 --> 13:47.601
- How did you approach them?
- Not by talking with them.

13:47.736 --> 13:49.278
What did you do?

13:49.404 --> 13:54.695
I'd spot a cute dame in the stands
and to get their attention, I'd...

13:55.452 --> 13:57.195
.. injure myself.

14:00.165 --> 14:02.738
- You intentionally hurt yourself?
- Sure.

14:02.876 --> 14:06.790
I'd lean into a pitch
or dive face-first into a bag.

14:06.922 --> 14:10.670
Take a hard grounder in the gut,
anything to get their sympathy.

14:11.343 --> 14:13.335
You were a sly one, Coach.

14:13.470 --> 14:17.550
One day I wasn't even in the game
and there was this real cutie there.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.008
So I threw myself
down the dugout steps.

14:21.019 --> 14:23.806
- It worked.
- You don't have to do that now.

14:24.856 --> 14:26.648
Look at her.

14:26.775 --> 14:30.986
She's all by herself,
a stranger in this big city.

14:31.112 --> 14:33.401
You are the only friend she has here.

14:34.366 --> 14:37.865
- Can we have some service back here?
- Coming right up.

14:37.994 --> 14:39.987
Go get her, tiger.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.248
- Coach. Can you cover me tonight?
- Sure, where you going?

14:47.379 --> 14:49.039
I'm going out with that lady.

14:49.172 --> 14:52.671
Diane is gonna learn the meaning
of the word comeback.

14:59.182 --> 15:01.222
Did you say something?

15:01.351 --> 15:03.474
Like...?

15:05.730 --> 15:07.438
- Yeah.
- That wasn't me.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.825
Can I have another beer, please?

15:41.725 --> 15:45.425
- Coach, what's going on here?
- Just a normal evening.

15:45.562 --> 15:48.349
I'm pouring a beer. Norm's in line.

15:48.481 --> 15:52.064
Sam's sweeping the girl of my dreams
off her feet. Normal night.

15:54.237 --> 15:56.395
I thought you were gonna do that.

15:56.531 --> 16:01.359
Come on, Sam's such a smoothie.
When did a woman last turn him down?

16:01.494 --> 16:03.570
Will you bug off?

16:08.209 --> 16:11.709
- Does that refresh your memory?
- I got her on the ropes.

16:12.589 --> 16:16.503
- You're a glutton for punishment.
- The evening's young.

16:16.634 --> 16:19.006
But your lines are old.

16:21.014 --> 16:25.723
Don't worry. I'm going out with your
friend tonight, even if it kills me.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.223
Coach, come on.
Now's your chance. Go.

16:29.355 --> 16:32.605
- Diane, who needs her?
- Coach.

16:32.734 --> 16:37.811
- Don't give up on Nina.
- Please leave me alone. Please.

16:38.656 --> 16:39.771
No!

16:39.907 --> 16:43.608
Get in there, you pipe,
and no backtalk.

16:46.164 --> 16:48.833
You can't come in here,
it's the men's room.

16:48.958 --> 16:51.995
- Carla's in here.
- Carla doesn't count.

16:52.128 --> 16:54.037
Watch it!

16:55.673 --> 17:00.300
- Diane, please, I want to be alone.
- Coach, if you don't act now,

17:00.428 --> 17:04.888
your life will be forever haunted
with the memory of lost opportunity.

17:05.016 --> 17:09.678
Maybe you're right, I should've tried
earlier, but Sam's after her now.

17:09.811 --> 17:13.477
- Can't you see that?
- So? He's not getting anywhere.

17:15.358 --> 17:18.858
- You got the hots for Nina?
- You know that, too?

17:19.530 --> 17:22.650
Carla, Coach is too shy
to ask Nina out.

17:22.784 --> 17:27.611
Come on, will you? Who wants
to date me? I'm over the hill.

17:27.747 --> 17:31.495
Nothing could be further
from the truth. I'd go out with you.

17:32.668 --> 17:35.338
- Really?
- I would, too.

17:35.463 --> 17:38.666
See? And we all know
how fussy Carla is.

17:48.309 --> 17:50.765
- You're not just saying this?
- No.

17:50.895 --> 17:55.771
Coach, you're a cutie.
Come on over here, cutie.

17:57.485 --> 18:00.154
Look at you. What a hunk!

18:01.656 --> 18:04.360
You're a pin-up guy.
Look at those shoulders.

18:04.492 --> 18:06.734
Stop it, the two of you.

18:08.329 --> 18:10.737
Who is that stud?

18:13.751 --> 18:17.037
I'm no Harold Flynn, but it's OK.

18:17.171 --> 18:18.713
Coach, it's Errol Flynn.

18:18.839 --> 18:22.884
No, Harold Flynn. He used to play
second base for Chicago.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.796
Good look, no hit.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.683
Diane, Carla,

18:29.809 --> 18:31.967
I'm gonna do it.

18:32.103 --> 18:34.558
Just give me a few minutes
to spruce up.

18:38.567 --> 18:42.897
Listen, Coach, that's great.
I'll make sure Nina sticks around.

18:43.781 --> 18:47.364
I can't believe the graffiti
in this place.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.569
Adolescent men are...

18:51.497 --> 18:52.742
What is it?

18:52.873 --> 18:55.543
"For a good time,
call Diane Chambers. "

18:55.668 --> 18:57.707
Thank God
they got the number wrong.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.672
I got it right off your application.

19:02.341 --> 19:07.501
- Carla, how could you?
- Last time I play Cupid for you.

19:08.764 --> 19:11.718
After our moonlight drive
up to the Cape,

19:11.851 --> 19:14.223
we'll check into separate rooms,

19:14.353 --> 19:16.761
one for us, one for our toothbrushes.

19:18.399 --> 19:21.934
- I wish you could bottle that charm.
- Is that right?

19:22.069 --> 19:24.275
Then I could put a cork in it.

19:27.575 --> 19:29.733
Sammy? Could I get a beer down here?

19:31.328 --> 19:33.155
I'll be back.

19:34.456 --> 19:36.248
Tell me you're not in trouble.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.826
Tell me you're playing around
with her, or I can't go on.

19:39.962 --> 19:41.753
I'm just playing with her.

19:43.632 --> 19:45.672
Just playing around with her...

19:49.680 --> 19:53.808
Give up. It takes a big man
to admit he's a small person.

19:55.644 --> 19:58.811
And now Harvard Yard.

20:00.524 --> 20:03.229
It was here that in 1535

20:03.360 --> 20:07.275
John Harvard raised
his eyes to heaven and announced...

20:07.406 --> 20:09.564
Line up, the can is fixed.

20:14.913 --> 20:19.042
I let you do this one time but
no more. I don't want you come back.

20:20.961 --> 20:25.089
Sorry about this.
They're studying for finals.

20:26.341 --> 20:29.627
Let's give a little consideration
and tiptoe out.

20:30.679 --> 20:36.682
Seems like all we've done all day
long was go from one bar to another.

20:39.897 --> 20:42.601
What do you want for eight bucks?
Minutemen?

20:43.150 --> 20:44.609
Move it.

20:48.447 --> 20:51.152
Nina, your super called.
Your heat's back on.

20:51.283 --> 20:52.825
Thanks, Carla.

20:57.873 --> 21:01.206
I sense that we've had some trouble
hitting it off tonight

21:01.335 --> 21:03.458
but I think I know why.

21:03.587 --> 21:08.712
Put aside for now my technique,
my style, my smooth manner.

21:08.842 --> 21:13.469
Put aside my hair,
my teeth, my physique.

21:13.597 --> 21:16.598
Put all that aside
and what have you got?

21:18.101 --> 21:20.011
Nothing.

21:20.145 --> 21:24.522
I didn't feel like being with
a woman tonight. Goodnight, Nina.

21:26.443 --> 21:28.685
It turns out we were cousins.

21:31.865 --> 21:35.779
Nina, can you wait just a minute?
The Coach wanted to say goodbye.

21:35.911 --> 21:37.453
OK.

21:37.579 --> 21:40.153
I give up. The woman's undateable.

21:41.041 --> 21:43.579
Undateable, Sam? I don't think so.

21:43.752 --> 21:48.295
In fact, I have a hunch you're about
to see that woman swept off her feet.

21:48.423 --> 21:50.380
You're crazy.

21:50.509 --> 21:53.925
It may seem impossible to you,
one whose idea of romance

21:54.054 --> 21:57.470
<i>is a floormat
and The Bolero played at 78,...</i>

21:58.767 --> 22:01.223
.. but you are about to see
a man get a date

22:01.353 --> 22:05.053
using nothing
but sincerity and his own feelings.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.064
She's kinky, huh?

22:15.659 --> 22:17.782
- The Coach?
- He's crazy about her.

22:17.911 --> 22:20.616
I'd have told you
but he swore me to secrecy.

22:20.747 --> 22:24.697
- He's been building up his courage.
- Stop him, she'll crush him.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.295
Nina?

22:29.089 --> 22:31.247
Ernie. I was waiting
to say goodnight.

22:33.593 --> 22:36.678
Listen, Nina,
I want to say something.

22:37.514 --> 22:42.639
Look, I'm not a rich guy,
and I'm no brain.

22:42.769 --> 22:44.726
I'm just an average guy.

22:44.855 --> 22:48.686
But I like you and I'd like to go out
and do things with you.

22:48.817 --> 22:51.059
Would you have dinner
with me tonight?

22:51.194 --> 22:55.571
That's sweet of you, but I've got
a lot of unpacking to do, but thanks.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.450
Yea. Sure.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.492
Coach.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.620
Look, I got shot down, too.

23:04.749 --> 23:08.368
Listen. There are some women
in this world you can't get to.

23:08.503 --> 23:12.121
- She's all of them.
- I made reservations upstairs.

23:12.799 --> 23:15.171
Goodnight.
It was nice to meet you all.

23:17.095 --> 23:19.301
- Goodnight, Ernie.
- Bye, Nina.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.145
Coach!

23:28.106 --> 23:30.264
- He's out like a light.
- Wake up.

23:33.695 --> 23:35.687
Ernie, are you alright?

23:38.867 --> 23:41.488
- Are you OK?
- I'm just a little woozy.

23:41.619 --> 23:45.913
- Coach, let me take you home.
- Let me, I live there, anyway.

23:46.041 --> 23:49.244
- You've got all that unpacking.
- Don't be silly.

23:49.377 --> 23:52.544
This is a lot more important
than unpacking.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.042
Works every time.

24:07.645 --> 24:11.477
Sam,... I might not be in
tomorrow morning.
