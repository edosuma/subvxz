00:08.875 --> 00:12.943
What if I told you that
it's possible to go back in time.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.980
To a remote, mystic place.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.315
That is somehow familiar?

00:17.384 --> 00:18.817
This is it.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.952
This is a personal journey.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.988
That transcends
distance and time.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.389
I trek to scotland.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.125
With my good friend
melissa mcbride...

00:27.128 --> 00:29.361
I'm tracing my family roots.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.330
In an introspective quest
to uncover.

00:31.398 --> 00:33.498
A family history of long ago.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.867
This is my dream come true.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.969
Did you feel any vibrations?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.772
Norman, this is so much more
than I ever expected.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.940
This is it.

00:43.944 --> 00:47.646
All right, hit it!

00:47.714 --> 00:49.715
Here we go! Yeah, baby!

00:51.718 --> 00:54.319
That was crazy!

01:27.054 --> 01:31.289
This is destined to be
a different kind of ride,

01:31.358 --> 01:34.359
And not just because
I'm behind the wheel of a car.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.695
More on that later.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.897
In scotland,
there's a tale of mankind.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.200
That spans thousands of years.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.401
It's evident driving
through edinburgh.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.271
There's an assimilation
of old world and new.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.307
Here is a history
long intertwined with the uk.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.943
Of a people's fight for freedom.

01:51.011 --> 01:54.813
At the ballot box
and on the battlefield.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.115
It's my first time
exploring scotland,

01:57.118 --> 02:01.620
And, yeah, the first time
I've left my bike behind.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.622
But right now, I'm meeting up
with a dear friend.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.225
For what I hope will be
a life-changing journey.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.563
Hey. Hello.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.564
Hi, muffin.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.299
Hi. Hey.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.634
Isn't this fun?

02:15.702 --> 02:17.002
Look at this place.
What a cool spot.

02:17.004 --> 02:20.505
Let's get some tea
while we're here.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.574
No one's indispensable
on "the walking dead,".

02:22.576 --> 02:25.777
But melissa mcbride
might just be the exception.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.913
For eight seasons,
her portrayal of carol.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.115
Has won over fans
and critics alike,

02:30.184 --> 02:32.918
And the two of us have been
tight ever since the beginning.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.986
Cheers.
Good to see you, sweetheart.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.032
This is gonna be a fun ride.

02:36.056 --> 02:36.989
It's gonna be great.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.057
Different.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.458
Different's good. Yeah.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.928
Yeah, we...
We came up with this idea.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.636
While we were filming
"the walking dead,".

02:44.665 --> 02:46.031
Sitting in that field.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.643
I was like, "you should
be on the show."

02:47.667 --> 02:49.134
You should get your license."
you're like, "okay."

02:49.136 --> 02:50.936
And I worked really hard
to get my motorcycle license.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.104
And now here we are,
except the weather's dreary.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.173
Yeah.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.074
And I'm... I'm a new rider.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.143
I'm not... I don't feel
that comfortable.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.612
Just yet for these conditions, so...
Yeah, well, I'm... I...

03:00.614 --> 03:02.974
I don't think anybody feels
comfortable in these conditions,

03:03.016 --> 03:04.327
So it's better...
We have a car now, so...

03:04.351 --> 03:05.751
I think we have
a good alternative.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.552
Yeah.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.355
I remember the first scene
I ever did with you on the show.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.924
Was handing you that pickaxe,

03:11.992 --> 03:13.458
And I kept get...
First time I gave it to you,

03:13.460 --> 03:15.827
It had a little bit of blood
and you grabbed it.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.473
And then I kept going,
"mark, put more blood on it."

03:17.497 --> 03:19.965
Yanked it out of my hand.
You were so antagonistic.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.868
And I, I liked... it was like...
you were just, like, chiding me...

03:22.936 --> 03:24.347
Yeah, I was... And
shoving it up in my face.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.837
I was pushing it.
I was pushing it.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.472
But it's like, you know,

03:27.474 --> 03:29.018
In grade school, when
you kind of like someone,

03:29.042 --> 03:30.375
You're like...
You kind of, like, poke them.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.554
Well, that's when I thought,
"you know what?

03:31.578 --> 03:33.311
I'm gonna like that guy."

03:33.314 --> 03:35.814
Yeah, yeah, we hit it off
right from the beginning.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.483
"What an"
"what a... what a jerk.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.695
I like that guy." "I like him."

03:39.719 --> 03:41.319
yeah.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.154
You been here before?
You been to scotland?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.034
I've never been here before.
I haven't, either.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.591
I'm j... I feel like I'm just, -

03:46.660 --> 03:48.438
Well, I know that I have
roots here, you know?

03:48.462 --> 03:51.863
I feel like... I don't know...
I have this genetic memory...

03:51.931 --> 03:53.999
Yeah... That's somehow
being passed down.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.333
Through the generations.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.068
You get a little piece
of memory, you know?

03:57.137 --> 03:58.570
I was looking up my ancestry,

03:58.639 --> 04:01.740
And I found that... that I have
relatives in aberdeen.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.708
Is mcbride a scottish name?

04:03.711 --> 04:08.446
It's my father's mother side,
and she's a campbell. Campbell?

04:08.449 --> 04:11.349
When you get a hit, it's like,
"this is so exciting."

04:11.352 --> 04:13.485
It's like uncovering a mystery.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.631
Yeah, I feel like a detective. I've
never done my... my family tree,

04:15.655 --> 04:17.022
Not so much. You should.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.134
I'm kind of... you know,
it's like I kind of.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.724
Don't know if I wanna know.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.892
I know there's a lot of, like,
criminal activity,

04:21.962 --> 04:23.495
And, like, I know,
like, I had a...

04:23.563 --> 04:25.074
Like, a great-great-grandfather
that was, like,

04:25.098 --> 04:26.698
Hung as a horse thief.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.934
And, like... like, crazy,
crazy stories like that.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.702
But this is all about you.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.437
I wanna... we're, we're gonna
find your stuff right now.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.539
It's gonna be great. I just...

04:34.607 --> 04:36.107
I want that to be our mission.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.376
Yeah, that'll be our mission.
Yeah, yeah.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.578
Let's get out of here.
Let's go do stuff.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.083
You wanna see our ride? Yes.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.752
Voilà. And it'll be much warmer.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.220
Yeah.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.089
It's a lot of fun. Let's go.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.091
We can do this.

04:53.159 --> 04:56.728
All right, this is gonna
be a good trip. Aah!

05:00.633 --> 05:02.400
If you're gonna come over,
come to edinburgh.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.135
There's so much going on.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.305
Edinburgh's a very
historic city.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.406
It's got a very rich,
long history.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.509
Wow. Look at that, like,
castle-y ruin right there.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.244
Edinburgh's very open
to the world.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.679
And... and, it's a great city,

05:14.748 --> 05:18.483
And I... and I wouldn't live
anywhere else.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.985
It really is magical here.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.588
It is. It's breathtaking.
My god.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.167
Over the next three days,
we're on a mission to learn.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.092
About melissa's family history.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.337
While seeking out
scottish culture.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.495
And tradition along the way.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.297
As we leave edinburgh behind,

05:32.365 --> 05:35.433
We'll learn about a curious
national pastime in kinross.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.870
Before heading up to perth
to visit a native breed of dogs.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.605
Perched on the edge
of the north sea,

05:40.673 --> 05:42.307
We'll reach aberdeen,

05:42.375 --> 05:44.520
Which is where we hope
to discover more about the life.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.644
Of melissa's
great-great-grandfather,

05:46.647 --> 05:47.979
Alexander campbell.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.325
I can't...
I can't believe I'm here.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.515
Edinburgh, brah. Brah.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.250
Edin-brah.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.456
It's got to be weird
driving on the left.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.990
There we go.

05:59.058 --> 06:01.025
The skyline's just
gorgeous here just, like,

06:01.094 --> 06:03.362
Everywhere you turn,
everywhere you look.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.364
Did I hit something? Yes!

06:06.367 --> 06:07.532
What was it? The curb.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.735
Good. Whoa.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.470
This is where... aw.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.139
This is where I lose a mirror.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.407
Ready? No!

06:15.475 --> 06:16.908
Clip, clip.
Whoa, that was close.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.644
God. Wow. That was really close.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.147
That was pretty close.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.417
Before we head out of town,
we're making a quick stop.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.018
Do you know the story
of the campbells?

06:27.086 --> 06:29.254
No, and that's something
that I wanna find out...

06:29.322 --> 06:30.689
How they may have lived,

06:30.757 --> 06:32.657
What a day in the life
might've been like.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.093
Since each clan claims
their own pattern,

06:35.095 --> 06:38.697
We're here to find the colors
of melissa's campbell ancestors.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.832
Tartan weaving mill.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.035
The scottish traditional dress
for a man is the kilt.

06:44.103 --> 06:47.172
There is that kind of
animalistic thing.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.340
About just wearing a...

06:49.409 --> 06:51.743
A whole suede of tartan
around you.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.346
Here we go.
This is definitely the spot.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.181
This is, like, the real deal.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.016
And, of course, a true scot.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.219
Doesn't wear anything
under his kilt.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.687
It gets a bit drafty.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.422
- Hi.
- Hey, guys. How you doing?

07:04.425 --> 07:05.501
Tristan. Nice to see ya. Nice
to meet you, tristan, yeah.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.525
- Hi there.
- Hi. Melissa.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.239
Melissa. Tristan. We've got lots of
tartans, lots of different clans.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.197
What about campbell?
What colors would campbell be?

07:12.199 --> 07:14.866
Campbell? Well, yeah, campbell's
one of the, most famous clans.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.267
Th... that we have in scotland,

07:16.336 --> 07:18.102
And it's very much
a blue and a green.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.273
There we go. Blue and the green.

07:22.342 --> 07:25.577
So that's the colors
for clan campbell,

07:25.645 --> 07:27.812
And that's the official crest
of the clan campbell.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.992
It's a boar. It's a boar's head.
A boar. How cool is that?

07:30.016 --> 07:32.050
And, this is in gaelic.

07:32.118 --> 07:37.222
It's "ne obliviscaris," and that
means, "forget not."

07:37.290 --> 07:39.424
Ne obliviscaris. Yes.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.370
I think you spoke that pretty well.
Pretty well, yeah. You did a good job.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.294
I wish I had a scottish name.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.429
What's your surname?

07:44.497 --> 07:46.231
Reedus. So reedus.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.901
So the name "reed" is... is
quite a popular name over here,

07:49.969 --> 07:51.803
And it's linked
to the robertson clan.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.572
What's the robertson tartan?
I ca-can show you.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.342
I would've never put "reed"
and "robertson" together.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.911
There's a red robertson, which
is that one there. Wow.

07:59.979 --> 08:03.315
So that's the... the most famous
dress robertson.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.916
Wow. That one there.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.354
You look good.
I'm startin' to feel it.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.727
So this is where it all begins.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.296
How long have these machines
been in production?

08:18.298 --> 08:21.432
Well, these machines are
approximately 100 years old.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.204
And then the material
comes off the... off the loom.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.539
So the material's woven.

08:27.607 --> 08:28.840
We make it into kilts,

08:28.908 --> 08:30.809
And the kilts
are made here, as well.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.682
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.529
- Elaine, dora, and helen.
- Hi. How's it going?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.352
So I guess the ladies
are making the kilts.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.022
Is it just nonstop kilt,
kilt, kilt, kilt?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.823
I've made over 20,000 kilts?

08:45.826 --> 08:47.025
Have you really? Wow.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.294
Do you just dream about kilts?

08:49.362 --> 08:53.098
After I had my first child, um,
I couldn't sleep after that,

08:53.166 --> 08:56.634
So I would just sew
and sew and sew.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.470
I could sew for two or three
days without any sleep.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.172
That first child
sold a lot of kilts.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.608
Definitely.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.517
Nice to meet you ladies.
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.711
Yeah. Very nice to meet you.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.213
Pleasure.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.048
So, this is our
little bagpipe room.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.050
This is ewan.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.216
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.652
This is melissa. Hello. Welcome.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.887
Nice to meet you. How are you?
Norman.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.232
Nice to meet you, sir. It's a pleasure,
yeah. Hi, there. Nice to see ya.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.690
What's the history
of the bagpipe?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.058
Where did that happen?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.093
It's famous in scotland, right?
Yeah.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.329
But the first pipe
ever discovered is, basically,

09:24.397 --> 09:25.930
Iraq... old babylonia.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.466
Was it ever, like,
the stomach of an animal,

09:28.535 --> 09:29.934
Or did I make that up?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.369
- You did make that up.
- Okay.

09:31.437 --> 09:32.537
But it's not just you
that made that up.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.671
Everybody makes that up.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.839
Can we hear a little bit?

09:34.907 --> 09:36.174
You certainly can.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.542
I think that you should do it.

09:37.544 --> 09:41.146
This is your scottish-heritage
exploration.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.014
I'll... I'll try it with you.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.950
So just give it a go,
and keep going.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.355
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's it. That's it.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.001
- Did I do that?
- Yeah, yeah, you did, you did.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.025
Keep going. More.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.527
Excellent.

09:56.530 --> 09:57.696
Am I doing that?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.197
Yeah, yeah. More, more, more.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.099
More! More!

10:07.240 --> 10:08.973
I'm just gonna shut the door.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.809
That was really good.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.582
No, it's... it's...
It's not like a guitar.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.552
Slash has got nothing on me.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.454
Thank you so much.
That was awesome.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.467
Thank you very much. That was so fun.
All right, thanks very much.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.651
Good, good. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you again, man.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.595
- Can I get a picture, too?
- Yes, ma'am.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.397
Yeah. That feels good.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.899
Yeah. He said, "yeah."

10:34.967 --> 10:36.401
Yeah, sometimes
you get recognized,

10:36.403 --> 10:38.536
But this...
This was a happy accident.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.837
Let's go to...

10:39.906 --> 10:41.773
We're going to kinross
and go curling.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.307
Wow.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.443
This is pretty, right?
And that's edinburgh castle.

10:45.511 --> 10:46.611
Wow.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.482
Looks like it just grew right
up out of the... yeah.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.917
Like, it did.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.086
This could be my last view
of edinburgh.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.421
Edin-brah.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.983
Just when I learned
how to pronounce it.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.334
Let's get out of town.
All right. Let's move along.

10:59.358 --> 11:01.592
Let's go curl.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.762
A scottish proverb claims,
"visit this place once,

11:04.765 --> 11:07.232
And it will stick
with you forever."

11:07.300 --> 11:09.167
And as we drive out
of edinburgh...

11:09.235 --> 11:10.835
- Edinburgh, brah.
- Brah.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.270
Edin-brah. Edin-brah.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.272
I already understand why.

11:15.775 --> 11:16.975
Whoa! Sorry.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.342
You ready to curl, girl?

11:18.411 --> 11:19.811
Don't stop. Don't stop.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.512
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.248
I feel like I've been
transported.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.783
Do you know where
nigg bay would've been?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.051
This is nigg bay.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.627
Fans of "the walking dead"
are quick to point out.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.763
The chemistry between
daryl and carol,

11:38.831 --> 11:41.632
And off-screen, you might say
our friendship has no bounds.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.936
Did you just fart, norman?

11:45.004 --> 11:46.471
I did not fart. You just farted.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.806
Swear to god I didn't.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.474
It was me. You farted?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.277
You and scott wilson are
the biggest farters on our show.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.979
And then andy and I are like,
"you guys are gross."

11:56.349 --> 11:58.015
We're in scotland
to dig up details.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.618
On melissa's great-great
paternal grandfather,

12:00.620 --> 12:03.221
Who, years ago,
lived up in aberdeen.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.190
But one's heritage is more
than just the past.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.360
It's about understanding
the culture from which you came,

12:09.428 --> 12:11.496
And we've got a lot
left to learn.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.435
It's a 30-mile ride through
the southern scottish hillside.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.537
To the town of kinross.

12:19.605 --> 12:22.807
It's where we hope to beat
some locals at their own game.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.709
Scotland is beautiful.

12:24.777 --> 12:29.013
Everywhere you look
is amazingly gorgeous.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.948
This is your roots
right here, girl.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.186
We're there.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.388
Hey. Kinross curling.

12:37.456 --> 12:41.325
Let's do this.
You ready to curl, girl?

12:54.241 --> 12:55.673
Who came up with this?

13:13.026 --> 13:16.795
We have about 10,000 members,
that play in scotland.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.797
And then when did it become
an olympic sport?

13:18.865 --> 13:25.603
It became an olympic sport,
em, officially back in 1924.

13:25.671 --> 13:27.371
The aim of the game of curling.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.407
Is to get closest
to the center of the house.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.375
You're gonna aim to the left
and turn the stone.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.377
Or aim to the right and turn
the stone the other way.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.246
'Cause the more the stone spins,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.475
The less it's gonna curl
and the straighter it will go.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.951
All right. You ready?

13:41.388 --> 13:42.587
Aim for the brush,
and turn it clockwise.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.555
Okay. Wow, this is heavy.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.657
Aah!

13:48.228 --> 13:51.128
Go, baby, go, baby,
go, baby, go, baby, go!

13:56.135 --> 13:57.602
I went the wrong way.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.737
Nice. No, that's good.
That's good.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.539
- You're laughing.
- You're laughing at her.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.274
It's harder than it looks,
for real.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.542
It is harder, yeah. Yeah.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.816
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

14:11.818 --> 14:15.119
Get it on. Perfect.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.988
I figured that was illegal.
Yeah.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.289
Yeah.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.759
That was really fun.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.109
Well played. Well played. Yeah,
thank you for teaching us.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.664
Where are
you headin' off to now?

14:26.732 --> 14:29.901
I'm going to find out about
my ancestors, the campbells.

14:29.969 --> 14:30.869
What's the name?

14:30.937 --> 14:32.604
Campbells. Campbell.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.192
And I'm tracing my great-great-
grandfather, alexander campbell.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.577
There's a place called nigg.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.117
A wise scotsman once wrote,

14:46.185 --> 14:49.520
"we are all travelers
in the wilderness of this world,

14:49.588 --> 14:54.158
And the best we can find in our
travels is an honest friend."

14:54.160 --> 14:57.662
And as our first day in scotland
comes to a close,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.330
I'm excited to help
my good friend look.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.899
For what she came here to find.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.000
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers, guys.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.468
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Sláinte mhaith.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.937
Sláinte mhaith. I like that.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.214
Today, our mission is twofold...

15:17.217 --> 15:19.550
Engage in local culture.

15:19.618 --> 15:22.153
While attempting to avoid
running off the road.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.988
You are really huggin' the left.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.157
I'm huggin' the left?
You are huggin' the left.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.036
I like it over here.
We don't wanna get on the...

15:28.060 --> 15:30.561
Am I... am I hanging over the left?
I'm like, "aah."

15:30.563 --> 15:32.396
The fabric of scotland's society.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.565
Lies in its time-honored
traditions.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.901
The scots are a proud,
hardworking people.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.536
Whose customs and heritage.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.939
Continue to be passed down
and fiercely protected.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.673
Look at this cool dog.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.709
Hunting has always been
a way of life up here.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.244
Since the ancient times,
and we're heading to a place.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.246
That's keeping
that tradition alive.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.248
There's nothing better
than driving.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.917
Through the scottish
countryside.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.652
Without a doubt,
probably one of the most.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.754
Beautiful places in the world.

15:56.822 --> 15:59.256
It's stunning... the scenery,
the mountainside, the wildlife.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.491
It's pretty cool.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.659
And once you come here,

16:01.728 --> 16:03.728
You fall in love,
you never leave.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.864
It's so pretty here.

16:06.866 --> 16:07.866
Would you live out here?

16:07.933 --> 16:09.066
Yes. Right?

16:09.135 --> 16:11.102
You know, I've always had,

16:11.170 --> 16:14.338
Like, this romanticized
idea in my head.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.107
That I would love to just,

16:16.175 --> 16:19.343
Like, live on a cliffside
with some sheep.

16:19.412 --> 16:23.614
And the ocean crashing
on the cliff rock, yeah.

16:23.682 --> 16:26.283
Like a big douche commercial.
Ha-ha!

16:26.352 --> 16:29.687
You ruined the whole thing.
I hate you, norman.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.055
Kind of does, though,
doesn't it?

16:31.123 --> 16:32.790
Sounds like it.

16:37.963 --> 16:38.997
How are ya? I'm norman.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.075
I'm charlie. Charlie thorburn.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.232
Nice to meet you. Hello.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.466
Aren't you cold?

16:42.535 --> 16:43.367
We're scottish. Yeah.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.702
You're not cold.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.237
It's not raining
and it's not windy,

16:46.239 --> 16:48.239
So, you know, we're weird.
This is like the summer.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.979
Charlie thorburn started
mordor gundogs in 2006.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.114
Specializing
in labradors and spaniels,

16:57.183 --> 16:59.784
His innovative breeding
and training techniques.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.285
Have produced top-line dogs.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.254
Which are sought after
all over the world.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.922
Labradors
were invented in scotland.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.223
They originated here.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.325
It was a very old
scottish family...

17:08.394 --> 17:10.172
The... the buccleuch family,
the duke of buccleuch,

17:10.195 --> 17:12.530
Who's the biggest
landowner in europe.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.542
And were they always hunting dogs?
I mean, they were... and he...

17:14.567 --> 17:16.333
They were invented
as a hunting dog.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.269
He had a huge hunting estate...
He has a number of them still...

17:18.271 --> 17:20.971
And he wanted to create
his own dog, the labrador,

17:21.040 --> 17:22.406
Which is the most popular.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.142
And most famous
pedigree dog in the world.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.377
You know, hunting in...
In scotland, it's...

17:26.445 --> 17:28.779
It's a very old...
Very old tradition.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.815
But hunters around the world
have a little bit.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.817
Of a sort of hunt...
A hunter's bucket list.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.053
They wanna go to scotland,
and they wanna, you know,

17:35.121 --> 17:37.455
Hunt in the traditional
kind of scottish way.

17:37.523 --> 17:40.157
What we want them for is
to retrieve game birds for us.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.126
They will retrieve a pheasant,
a rabbit, a hare.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.095
So... have you ever
trained a dog to, like,

17:44.163 --> 17:45.496
Work with scotland yard.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.965
And find bodies
or anything crazy like that?

17:48.033 --> 17:51.035
Um, we've got a springer spaniel
that went to the police.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.437
As a-a drug-sniffer dog
just last year.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.706
We've got a little cocker
spaniel that is called cookie.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.641
She sniffs all the...
Kind of the queen's cars.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.176
And aeroplanes and things.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.889
When she goes up to aberdeen,
she goes and checks out,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.724
Makes sure prince philip
isn't carrying anything.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.293
He shouldn't do on the plane...
That kind of thing.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.117
Right.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.718
So, this is mufasa.

18:07.786 --> 18:10.054
You need to be, like,
assertive enough.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.789
That he's confident
to go with you, okay?

18:11.791 --> 18:14.191
Come on, mufasa. Come on.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.827
Heel. And sit. Can I keep it?

18:18.063 --> 18:19.263
Can I keep mufasa?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.633
Go get it.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.871
This is a complete
opposite of my cat.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.205
Like, complete opposite.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.406
My cat's like, "hey, what's up?"

18:29.409 --> 18:30.875
Bleh! Clean that up."

18:30.943 --> 18:32.409
You know what I mean?

18:32.478 --> 18:34.345
Okay, so, simple as that.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.147
So do you wanna try...
Try with him,

18:36.149 --> 18:37.281
We'll see how you get on?

18:37.350 --> 18:41.085
Sure. Nacho, heel, heel.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.127
- Nacho's not loving you.
- He's like, "nacho mama."

18:43.189 --> 18:44.266
Come on. You gotta be positive...
Okay.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.624
But you've also got to... Yes.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.769
You've gotta be friendly with him, as well.
I gotta be stern and friendly. Okay.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.560
Nacho. Come on.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.262
There you go. You see?
Heel. Heel.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.564
Come, nacho. Nacho.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.499
So, so far on the grading scale,

18:55.568 --> 18:57.128
Norman's getting, like,
a "b"-plus, "a."

18:57.169 --> 18:58.702
Sit. Sit. Good.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.615
Melissa, I'm afraid you're not
doing quite so well.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.873
God.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.208
- Sit.
- Sit.

19:04.276 --> 19:07.545
He's so happy. He's so happy.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.121
You're the best.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.671
- Thank you so much for all this.
- No problem.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.395
Really nice to meet you.
Yeah, super interesting, yeah.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.764
It was so nice to meet you.
Thank you for the training tips.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.265
Thanks.
And have a good onward journey.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.378
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, thank you.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.335
- Thank you.
- It'll be fun.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.649
You might be actually seeing
what... what your ancestors saw.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.406
He probably stood right here.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.875
This is my dream come true.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.476
I feel like
I've been transported.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.245
We're in the "game of thrones."

19:45.384 --> 19:47.485
Sorry.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.554
Could... I forgot where...
What gear I was in.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.755
What?

19:51.758 --> 19:53.157
What? What? I'm a great driver.

19:53.225 --> 19:54.458
I didn't say anything.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.160
I'm a very good driver,
like "rain man."

19:56.228 --> 19:58.563
Crammed within
scotland's 30,000 square miles.

19:58.631 --> 20:04.168
Is a storied history of man
that spans over 10,000 years.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.371
Heading north,
it's a 40-mile ride up the a90.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.939
Where we'll reach
a medieval fortress.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.475
Overlooking the cliffs
of stonehaven.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.846
The dunnottar castle.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.181
What's the story of it?

20:17.249 --> 20:19.783
"The ruins are spread
over 3.5 acres."

20:19.786 --> 20:23.621
On top of steep cliffs
that drop into the north sea.

20:23.689 --> 20:28.459
It's best known as the place
where the honours of scotland.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.595
Were hidden from
oliver cromwell's.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.464
"Invading army
in the 17th century."

20:35.535 --> 20:37.234
My god. So we're related.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.502
What are you talking about?

20:38.570 --> 20:40.304
Oliver cromwell
is my mother's side.

20:40.372 --> 20:41.939
So it's your mom's side?
Is that right?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.741
Probably more than likely.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.409
Probably more than
likely that...

20:45.411 --> 20:48.212
He's my 14th-great-grandfather.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.148
Yeah, I'm kind of
getting the chills.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.816
Back in the 17th century,

20:52.885 --> 20:56.354
England controlled all
of scotland, ireland, and wales,

20:56.422 --> 20:58.589
And cromwell,
he was lord protector,

20:58.657 --> 21:00.090
Beloved in England,

21:00.159 --> 21:03.127
Deemed a brutal dictator
by the irish and scots.

21:03.195 --> 21:07.498
What you thought of him depended
on whose side you were on.

21:07.566 --> 21:11.836
For melissa, this place is
a labyrinth of family history.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.172
With paths that cross in
the most unexpected of ways.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.044
Is that it?

21:20.112 --> 21:23.013
Welcome to dunnottar castle.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.350
That doesn't even look real.

21:26.418 --> 21:28.118
That's so king arthur.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.029
This is overwhelming, norman.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.631
Overwhelming, yeah.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.403
What?

21:46.406 --> 21:47.538
Mel, this is nuts.

21:47.606 --> 21:48.873
I wonder... where are we?

21:48.941 --> 21:50.107
I don't know.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.486
I feel like
I've been transported.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.711
We're in the "game of thrones."

21:56.382 --> 21:58.248
Are you the keeper
of the castle?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.616
Jim. Pleased to meet you.
Jim, nice to meet you.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.318
How's things? Good.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.931
Hey. How are ya? Norman. Hi, norman.
How you doin'?

22:02.955 --> 22:04.132
How's things? Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.756
It's great.
This place is awesome.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.991
Which is the oldest
part of this castle?

22:08.060 --> 22:11.462
So, the oldest part of
the castle is just right here.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.763
There was a chapel here.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.332
1276,= actually, this was built.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.867
The castle changed hands.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.802
Backwards and forwards
over the years.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.105
And, william wallace
took it back from the english.

22:21.107 --> 22:24.007
And, took it back for scotland.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.946
How did they pick this land
to put the castle on? Like...

22:28.948 --> 22:32.316
There was a road that went
between edinburgh.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.985
So, if you wanted to move
any men or armies.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.454
Or anything of any size,

22:36.522 --> 22:39.523
You'd have to move...
Move on this road.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.826
And the castle here was built
to defend that road.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.163
So, what happened back in 1650s,

22:46.231 --> 22:48.999
Oliver cromwell wanted to
take over britain, basically.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.534
He marched on scotland.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.836
And wanted to... to destroy
the crown jewels.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.506
So, they were
brought here for safe keeping.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.141
Oliver cromwell's army.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.811
Was camped up on the hill
just at the top here.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.046
Wow.

23:06.785 --> 23:09.386
The crown jewels were saved
by some local people,

23:09.389 --> 23:11.288
Smuggled out of the castle,

23:11.357 --> 23:13.524
And taken down to
the local church and buried,

23:13.592 --> 23:16.293
For about eight or nine years.

23:16.295 --> 23:18.695
And then, when charles ii.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.698
Was re-established as,
the king of britain,

23:21.701 --> 23:23.534
The crown jewels
were given back to him.

23:25.771 --> 23:28.872
The people that got the jewels
out... was it a woman?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.340
It was a woman.

23:30.343 --> 23:31.842
The person who was
in charge of the castle.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.544
Was a guy called george ogilvy,

23:33.612 --> 23:37.581
And his wife arranged
with another woman,

23:37.583 --> 23:40.117
Mrs. Grainger,
who is the minister's wife.

23:40.186 --> 23:43.554
She arranged in secret with her
to smuggle them out.

23:43.622 --> 23:44.988
And didn't even tell
her husband.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.435
Taking the initiative
and just doing it herself.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.558
Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

23:47.626 --> 23:48.859
"We've got to save the jewels."

23:48.861 --> 23:50.260
Yeah.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.835
They say there was only
40 people here.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.837
That defended the castle
for eight months.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.438
From oliver cromwell's army,

24:01.441 --> 24:03.841
So it's an amazing feat, you
know, when you think about it.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.342
- Wow.
- Yeah.

24:05.344 --> 24:06.944
That is an amazing feat.
Especially when you just.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.213
Wreak so much havoc across scotland.
Yeah.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.059
Have you heard a wee bit
about oliver cromwell, then?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.293
Have you done
some research on him?

24:12.317 --> 24:15.352
Might be related.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.554
No way.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.089
Quite possibly
my 14th grandfather.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.858
Really? Yes.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.893
Yeah, that's... that's
a bit... I don't know.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.439
I don't know if I should
let you in the castle.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.796
Or not in that case.

24:25.864 --> 24:26.764
Yeah, I don't know.
Just throw me over.

24:26.832 --> 24:28.866
Throw me over now.

24:30.335 --> 24:32.013
From what I've heard
about him, that may be.

24:32.037 --> 24:33.415
I mean, he... he...
It was like he was...

24:33.439 --> 24:36.040
He was fighting
for a revolution.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.308
He wanted, you know,
the... the people in charge.

24:38.377 --> 24:41.378
Do you think his... his ideas
were good to start with.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.614
And he just went off the rails?

24:43.682 --> 24:45.148
What do you think?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.984
I don't know how to ta...
I don't know how to take him.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.421
Yeah. I mean, I know
I don't know.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.890
Scotland's ongoing 800-year.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.392
Struggle for independence
from british rule.

24:55.394 --> 24:58.428
Has oft pitted clan versus clan,

24:58.497 --> 25:01.098
A complex plight still
without resolution today.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.504
How you feelin'?
What are you thinkin'?

25:07.507 --> 25:09.606
I've just... so much
goin' on in my head.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.108
You know what's funny?

25:11.176 --> 25:13.243
I was actually thinking
about, um, negan.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.813
Like how? Like, a guy
like oliver cromwell,

25:15.881 --> 25:17.648
I think maybe
he... he started out.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.650
With the best
intentions, you know?

25:19.718 --> 25:23.153
And then just kind of...

25:23.222 --> 25:25.255
I don't know,
you lose sight of...

25:25.324 --> 25:27.258
Lose sight of everything,
and then...

25:27.326 --> 25:31.828
And then the way you go about
things defeats the purpose.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.597
That's the thing
about family roots.

25:33.665 --> 25:37.534
Dig deep enough, and you might
not like what you unearth.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.169
And after invoking that name...

25:39.237 --> 25:40.604
All right,
let's park this sucker.

25:40.672 --> 25:43.373
I think it's time
we call it a night,

25:43.442 --> 25:45.509
Because tomorrow,
the city of aberdeen calls,

25:45.577 --> 25:47.477
And we continue
our journey for answers.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.313
Beer?

25:50.248 --> 25:52.449
By this point, he's changed
his profession.

25:52.517 --> 25:54.217
Alexander... contractor.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.986
He sounds a little shady.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.148
I have a sneaking suspicion
that's actually on purpose.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.561
Wow. Hold on.

26:03.629 --> 26:06.397
Look at that dude.
Let's go talk to him.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.566
Wow. These birds are beautiful.

26:09.569 --> 26:10.867
- I'm steve.
- I'm norman.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.536
Nice to meet you.
This is melissa.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.015
Hi, steve. Melissa. Nice to meet you.
Hi, melissa.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.283
Fancy trying one on the glove?
Sure.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.708
She's so pretty.
You're so pretty.

26:17.776 --> 26:20.010
Chillin' with an owl.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.244
Aww.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.313
He's so "harry potter,"
that one.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.749
Hi.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.652
I think carol should have
a bird on the show.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.120
Does he look relaxed?

26:30.188 --> 26:31.388
He looks relaxed, yeah.

26:31.456 --> 26:32.790
He's not too bad. "Not too bad."

26:32.858 --> 26:34.425
In my mind, I'm thinking,

26:34.493 --> 26:36.493
"this bird could just
rip my face off."

26:36.561 --> 26:38.295
Nah, he's never
done anything yet.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.563
Yet.

26:39.631 --> 26:41.498
Well.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.700
Hello.

27:00.585 --> 27:03.120
Riding in scotland, you get to
experience the scottish weather.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.122
In all its cold, wet glory.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.526
Day three, we continue
our travels toward aberdeen,

27:09.528 --> 27:12.463
The home of melissa's
great-great-grandfather,

27:12.531 --> 27:14.798
And where we'll explore
her family history.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.072
Look at those guys,

27:22.074 --> 27:24.307
Just chillin' out
in the middle of the field.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.210
"Yeah, we're sheep, chillin'."

27:28.147 --> 27:29.546
Wow. Look how pretty.

27:29.614 --> 27:31.415
Aren't you freezing?

27:31.483 --> 27:34.885
Want to get up close
and personal with...

27:34.953 --> 27:36.086
With this... want to get out?

27:36.088 --> 27:38.822
Let's go meet some sheep people.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.191
Is that a farm?
Like, behind there?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.900
Whoo!

27:51.169 --> 27:52.302
Wow. What is this?

27:52.371 --> 27:55.839
Wonder if that's... Hello?

27:55.841 --> 27:57.240
Hi.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.842
- Hello.
- Hi.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.477
I'm melissa.

28:00.546 --> 28:02.056
Hi. I'm alice. Nice to meet you.
Hi, alice.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.424
Nice to see you.
Sorry, I've got muddy hands.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.049
Hi. Norman.
It's nice to meet you.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.494
Nice to meet you. Hi. Hello, sir.
How are you?

28:06.518 --> 28:07.684
How are you, melissa?
This is my dad.

28:07.687 --> 28:08.518
How are you? What's your name?

28:08.521 --> 28:10.087
Graham.

28:11.957 --> 28:15.092
We are one of two rare-breed
farm parks in scotland,

28:15.094 --> 28:16.526
And we specialize in breeding.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.028
Rare and endangered livestock.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.262
This guy included?

28:19.331 --> 28:20.864
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yep.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.410
This is runrig. What... what is this?
Is this...

28:22.434 --> 28:25.068
So he's an english
longhorn bull.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.270
So he's just a baby.
He's about a year.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.773
Baby? Yeah.

28:29.841 --> 28:31.575
Okay?

28:33.679 --> 28:35.378
So, what are you guys
doing in scotland?

28:35.447 --> 28:37.881
Well, I'm... long story short,

28:37.883 --> 28:40.017
I'm tracing my family roots...

28:40.085 --> 28:42.686
Okay... And I have
tracked them to aberdeen.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.688
Well, luckily, a lot
of the stuff in aberdeen.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.556
Is still present.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.392
So nothing's really
changed that much. Good.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.428
So I hope you find really
lovely, great things.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.896
Thank you.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.965
I have a lot...
A lot more research to do.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.236
What do you think a day
in the life.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.605
Of a sheepherder would've
been like back in the 1800s?

29:01.673 --> 29:03.040
Brutal.

29:03.108 --> 29:05.342
You'd have to love the job,
because, you know,

29:05.344 --> 29:08.011
You be with your flock
all the time.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.313
You'd keep warm... you know,
your life was the sheep,

29:10.316 --> 29:11.915
And if you lost them
or if something was ill.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.984
Or something happened,
then that's you costing money.

29:13.986 --> 29:17.221
That's your livelihood. Yeah,
that is your livelihood, yeah.

29:17.289 --> 29:20.290
What made you guys get into,
saving livestock and so forth?

29:20.358 --> 29:23.160
Well, my dad's
always been a farmer,

29:23.228 --> 29:26.329
And then we work with
the rare breeds survival trust,

29:26.398 --> 29:29.933
Which is, um, the only
organization to help rare breeds.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.368
It's such a beautiful
place to live.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.104
It was so nice,
to drive up here.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.917
The north sea is right here,
and it's a really lovely view.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.381
We've got lots
of lovely gully caves,

29:37.442 --> 29:38.842
And it's all up the coast. Yeah.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.321
And so if you wanna come see...
Okay.

29:40.345 --> 29:41.845
That'd be really good.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.183
Welcome to the north sea.

29:46.251 --> 29:47.951
Wow. This is beautiful, though.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.820
Wow!

29:51.690 --> 29:52.989
Beautiful view.

29:53.058 --> 29:55.792
And some very fresh air.

30:01.299 --> 30:04.067
I would imagine that most people
that took residence around here.

30:04.135 --> 30:07.537
Were farming
some way or another.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.783
Um it would've been
a lot of farming.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.640
And fishing and quarrying.

30:10.643 --> 30:13.110
And, um, we've got the harbor
in aberdeen,

30:13.178 --> 30:15.112
Which would've been
a fishing port at one point.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.647
Do you know where
nigg bay would've been?

30:17.716 --> 30:19.316
This is nigg bay.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.151
This is nigg bay?

30:21.219 --> 30:23.531
So there is a lighthouse, which
you... you can't really see.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.589
At the moment,
but that's nigg bay.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.491
So we are in nigg at the moment.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.925
Wow. Yeah.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.428
Nigg bay is...
Is where her family lived.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.830
Well, there you go. Yeah.
Could've been right here.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.466
So you might be actually seeing
what... what your ancestors saw.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.401
They probably stood right here.

30:38.470 --> 30:39.837
This is it.

30:39.905 --> 30:42.372
This is kinda it.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.640
This is my dream come true.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.576
This is it right there.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.545
There's something enchanting
about discovering.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.047
You're standing in the shadows
of family ghosts,

30:51.116 --> 30:54.417
And stumbling upon this place,
half a world away from home,

30:54.420 --> 30:58.155
Feels less of a coincidence
with every wave that crashes.

30:58.223 --> 30:59.623
So nice to meet you. You, too.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.924
Ready? To the car.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.392
To the car. Okay, bye.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.627
Bye. Thank you so much.
Bye. Thank you.

31:03.629 --> 31:04.961
Bye. Bye.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.031
- My gosh.
- Dude!

31:08.033 --> 31:09.699
Yeah, that was
a little emotional.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.568
Throughout my life,

31:11.636 --> 31:13.470
I've never had much
in the way of roots.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.405
I didn't look back because
I didn't think

31:15.473 --> 31:17.908
I had anything, really,
to look back to.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.309
How do you feel?

31:19.377 --> 31:20.755
I'm starting to feel
a little overwhelmed.

31:20.779 --> 31:22.545
Yeah, so, your relatives
were right here,

31:22.614 --> 31:24.047
Looking at that ocean.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.183
I feel like I just...
It's all bubbling up,

31:26.251 --> 31:27.584
And I feel like I wanna scream.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.119
Aah! But I'm realizing now.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.054
Just how mistaken I've been
all along.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.256
But I feel so much better.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.392
As we leave the area
of nigg bay,

31:35.460 --> 31:37.394
It's a quick five-mile drive
up the coast.

31:37.462 --> 31:42.132
To our final destination,
the port city of aberdeen.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.101
The community in aberdeen
thrive to do really well,

31:45.170 --> 31:47.971
From the paper mills
to the quarries.

31:48.039 --> 31:50.440
And the fishing,
the oil industry.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.743
This is a cool little area
right here, right?

31:52.811 --> 31:54.211
Aberdeen has a lot of history.

31:54.279 --> 31:56.413
That you have to look
a little bit harder for,

31:56.481 --> 31:58.448
But once you find it,
it's pretty amazing.

31:58.516 --> 31:59.917
Legend has it that the left arm.

31:59.985 --> 32:01.785
Of scotland's
most celebrated folk hero.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.553
Is buried somewhere in the city,

32:03.622 --> 32:05.333
But I've heard there's
a statue of him around here.

32:05.357 --> 32:08.358
That might be
a little easier to find.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.760
Freedom!

32:09.828 --> 32:11.194
William wallace was the guy.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.330
That really wanted
freedom for scotland.

32:13.398 --> 32:17.434
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

32:17.502 --> 32:18.746
Hey, do you guys know
where the will...

32:18.770 --> 32:21.171
William wallace, memorial is?

32:21.173 --> 32:22.706
It's just down there on the...

32:22.774 --> 32:24.051
On the next crossroads
down there on the left.

32:24.075 --> 32:25.475
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.312
He led the scots to battle
in the battle of falkirk.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.847
And the battle of bannockburn.

32:30.849 --> 32:34.117
All right. William wallace...
Is that him?

32:34.119 --> 32:35.719
- Is that it, or no?
- I don't know.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.321
Is it? It says "george" on it.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.790
- George wallace?
- That's the wrong dude.

32:39.858 --> 32:41.625
That's okay. We'll find him.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.527
And we like to,
hail him as a hero.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.965
Probably in the middle
of this courtyard.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.899
Yeah, there you go. Look, look.

32:49.902 --> 32:52.469
He's right there.
No, that's not him.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.504
- Is that him right there?
- Yeah, it's gotta be.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.940
It is that whole sense
of freedom.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.675
That's what we're known for...
"freedom!"

32:58.744 --> 33:00.544
And, I mean, yeah,
I think we were all.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.878
Very proud of "braveheart."

33:01.880 --> 33:05.882
It was a slightly
altered version of fact.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.684
No, wait. Maybe that's him.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.085
- The big one?
- No.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.021
It created a lot of interest
in scotland,

33:11.089 --> 33:12.822
So maybe it's a...
Maybe it's a good thing.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.958
Despite how terrible it is.

33:15.027 --> 33:16.359
That's got to be him.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.894
Yeah, that's him.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.530
Doesn't look anything
like mel gibson.

33:20.598 --> 33:22.365
Wow.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.345
Hey, stand in front of that.
Let me take your picture.

33:24.369 --> 33:25.835
He was put to death.

33:25.904 --> 33:28.005
Solely for his love of liberty.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.306
I'm not gonna lie.

33:29.374 --> 33:31.508
"Braveheart" is a great movie.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.109
And although
william wallace's story.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.245
May have been victim
to hollywood hyperbole...

33:35.313 --> 33:36.679
Cool. I'm hungry.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.125
I'm hungry, too.
All right, let's eat.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.616
I can't help but admire.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.452
His unwavering resolve
for independence.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.387
What do you think of aberdeen?

33:44.456 --> 33:49.259
So far, it's, like, a really
nice mix of old world and new.

33:49.327 --> 33:50.460
Yeah. Weather's rough.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.095
Like, you... you have to have.

33:52.163 --> 33:56.033
A certain constitution
to... to do that, you know?

33:56.101 --> 33:57.600
I don't know
that I would make it.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.402
It's... it seems like
like hardworking,

33:59.405 --> 34:00.737
Good people here.

34:02.474 --> 34:06.976
Did you feel any... Vibrations?

34:07.045 --> 34:08.879
Well, I-I-I felt...
You know, I did.

34:08.947 --> 34:11.915
I got a real, like, very quick,
emotional reaction.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.550
When she said we were in nigg.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.418
"This is nigg bay."
I was like, "whoa, this is.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.955
Where I've seen the writing
on the papers."

34:18.956 --> 34:20.891
From what I've seen
in my research,

34:20.958 --> 34:22.492
This is... I know this is.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.061
At least where they were
for some time.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.228
I don't know. It just...

34:26.297 --> 34:27.831
It just like, quick.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.600
And that's, like,
what I imagined in my head.

34:30.668 --> 34:33.735
Here's to today.
Let's keep going.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.116
Melissa's
great-great-grandfather.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.505
Once called this place home...

34:36.507 --> 34:38.842
Aberdeen archives next. It's on.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.811
And we're off to see what
we can find out about his life.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.047
- You ready?
- Not really.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.983
I don't know
why I'm getting emotional.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.784
It's just kind of crazy
being here.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.920
Okay, let's go do this.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.640
We're heading over
to the aberdeen archives.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.342
They, by the time we get there,

35:12.410 --> 35:15.612
Are... will have pulled
some stuff for me.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.216
After three days of discovering
scotland, this is it,

35:19.284 --> 35:22.185
A chance to finally learn
about alexander campbell,

35:22.253 --> 35:24.621
Melissa's paternal,
great-great-grandfather.

35:26.324 --> 35:29.692
I'm here to, see a historian.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.429
Okay. I'll call upstairs...

35:32.497 --> 35:34.141
Okay. Thank you so much... And
let them know you're here.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.666
Thank you very much.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.245
You were coming here
to see someone today?

35:38.269 --> 35:39.602
Yes. I'll show you upstairs.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.271
Okay.
They're just at the top floor.

35:41.339 --> 35:42.705
All the central records
of the city.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.107
Are locked away
behind these doors.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.443
They go all the way back
to the 12th century.

35:46.511 --> 35:49.212
The oldest, record we have
is a chart.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.159
That was given to the city
by king william the lion.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.615
In the 1180s.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.984
What about the campbells?

35:54.987 --> 35:57.147
How... where do you think
that they might've come from?

35:57.188 --> 36:00.023
It's hard to say how far back
they go and where they go.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.125
It's also the origin
of the name campbell,

36:02.193 --> 36:04.460
Because it's more
of a nickname originally.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.529
The word originally
means "sneery".

36:06.598 --> 36:08.165
"Sneery" like... effectively.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.666
So, like... so, like...

36:09.734 --> 36:11.134
So, you would sneer.

36:11.202 --> 36:12.335
Sneery?

36:12.337 --> 36:13.636
That's my resting face.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.805
Sneery mcbride. Right.

36:18.042 --> 36:20.122
So, that was... it all makes
so much sense right now.

36:21.713 --> 36:25.248
But these are the census returns
for the campbells in 1851.-

36:25.250 --> 36:26.816
Robert. Isabella. James.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.151
Margaret. Alexander.

36:28.153 --> 36:30.253
That's my
great-great-grandfather.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.855
But alexander campbell
is listed as a quarrier,

36:32.924 --> 36:34.157
So he would've had a quarry.

36:34.225 --> 36:37.927
He had one? He had a quarry.

36:37.930 --> 36:41.097
They turn up in a couple of post
office directories, as well.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.565
There he is listed.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.200
Wow. Innkeeper?

36:44.203 --> 36:45.568
Innkeeper.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.571
Now, I've got
a slightly later one here,

36:47.639 --> 36:49.839
But by this point,
he's changed his profession.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.209
Alexander... contractor.

36:52.277 --> 36:53.576
He sounds a little shady.

36:53.579 --> 36:56.846
He's jack of
a great number of trades,

36:56.914 --> 37:02.218
But by the same token,
he kind of never quite achieves.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.921
A kind of prominence in the city
that other people do,

37:04.990 --> 37:07.123
And I'm... I have
a sneaking suspicion that.

37:07.191 --> 37:08.891
That's actually on purpose.

37:11.196 --> 37:14.764
At this point in July 1859,

37:14.832 --> 37:17.601
Alexander campbell
purchases two shares.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.936
Previously, we have
detailed records.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.871
Of what cargoes
people were bringing in.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.674
Contraband rum, or...
So, that might...

37:24.743 --> 37:26.542
What... it might be, like, rum.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.378
It could be.
He could be a rumrunner.

37:28.981 --> 37:32.815
This is for 1879,
and alexander campbell is noted.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.051
As being a proprietor
of ironmonger's court.

37:35.119 --> 37:36.953
This is the last place
where he lived.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.555
What is ironmonger's court?

37:38.623 --> 37:42.225
It's an alleyway that led off
of the main street.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.494
Ironmonger?
Blacksmith, effectively.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.562
There are three flats,

37:46.565 --> 37:51.234
And the third one
is occupied by alexander.

37:53.504 --> 37:55.772
There's a few photographs
that wou... that show.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.407
The neighborhood around there,

37:57.475 --> 37:59.643
Which was one of aberdeen's
most notorious slums.

37:59.711 --> 38:02.679
These are very heavily
subdivided tenements.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.781
So, you get numerous families.

38:04.849 --> 38:07.750
Living in incredibly
cramped conditions.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.687
The town decided to demolish
in the 1920s...

38:10.755 --> 38:14.023
Really? ...Because it was
a public health hazard.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.459
So, this aberdeen, this is
the city as it was then.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.528
That's the house...
That's the house,

38:18.596 --> 38:21.264
Ironmonger's court, where he
would've lived in his last year.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.832
Wow. And it's still there.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.635
Wow. So, it's just...
just north of here.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.603
They demolished
everything around it.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.140
So, when he died,

38:30.208 --> 38:33.009
Did he have
pretty much nothing left?

38:33.078 --> 38:36.980
Um, they don't have
a lot to their name.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.881
This is, like, a great mystery.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.684
It sounds shady as heck
to me... all of it.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.020
This is the inventory.

38:44.088 --> 38:47.023
Of the courtyard
of st. Fittick's at nigg,

38:47.092 --> 38:49.125
Which is where he's buried.

38:49.193 --> 38:50.493
There's a map in this book.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.082
Which should tell you
how to get to it.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.130
Excellent.

39:03.908 --> 39:06.276
- You ready?
- Not really.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.311
I don't know
why I'm getting emotional.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.146
I don't know them.

39:10.214 --> 39:11.981
I know.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.916
It's just kind of crazy
being here.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.987
Okay, let's go do this.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.830
Is this it?

39:27.899 --> 39:29.031
No.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.067
It's like an easter-egg hunt.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.403
Wait.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.705
Yeah, that's it.

39:35.773 --> 39:38.541
"Campbell."

39:38.610 --> 39:40.943
- I don't know why I'm emotional.
- I'm sorry.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.111
No.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.163
Did you get "alexander"
in there anywhere?

40:00.231 --> 40:01.364
Yeah, there you go.

40:01.366 --> 40:04.567
"Alexander." "alexander."

40:04.636 --> 40:06.636
I'm very happy with what I have.
Yeah.

40:06.704 --> 40:09.105
It's great, right?

40:09.107 --> 40:11.641
Ending up here and being able
to give melissa this gift.

40:11.643 --> 40:14.377
Goes beyond everything
I hoped this ride could be.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.580
It isn't often in this life.

40:17.648 --> 40:19.916
That you're able
to show true appreciation.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.584
To someone
you really care about.

40:21.652 --> 40:22.652
We found it.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.121
I know.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.558
And this is an experience
I'll hold onto forever.

40:33.130 --> 40:35.898
The germans have this word,
"fernweh,".

40:35.967 --> 40:38.234
And it's what brought us
and countless others here.

40:38.302 --> 40:39.936
To cure the homesickness felt.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.405
For a place
we've never truly known.

40:42.473 --> 40:44.207
The craziest thing
about this whole thing.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.009
Is we were shooting
"the walking dead,".

40:47.012 --> 40:51.147
Sitting between takes on this
field overlooking this cliff.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.682
Melissa, come here.

40:52.750 --> 40:53.950
And you go, "do you know
what'd be a great idea",

40:53.952 --> 40:55.318
Is to go to scotland."

40:55.386 --> 40:56.897
And I was like,
"that's what we'll do."

40:56.921 --> 40:58.321
And here we are. Here we are.

40:58.389 --> 41:01.791
From that moment,
we're at this moment.

41:01.859 --> 41:03.759
I know. That's pretty rad.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.962
But before we end our trip,
there's one more place

41:06.030 --> 41:07.964
Melissa needs to see...

41:07.966 --> 41:09.966
The last known address
of her ancestor

41:10.034 --> 41:11.835
Alexander campbell,

41:11.903 --> 41:14.504
Which, today, we found out
is still standing.

41:14.572 --> 41:16.706
- Perfect.
- Is this your bar?

41:16.774 --> 41:18.307
It is, yeah, yeah.

41:18.376 --> 41:19.942
What do you know
about this building?

41:20.011 --> 41:26.482
It... it was first used in 1777,
so it's 240 years old.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.318
And it was owned
by the mcbride family.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.720
From the what family?

41:30.788 --> 41:32.388
Mcbride family.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.490
And there's a... there's
a photograph on the wall there.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.792
I just got chills. That's crazy.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.661
Is this like coinkydink
all over the place?

41:41.733 --> 41:43.533
Wha-a-a-a-t? I gotta...

41:43.601 --> 41:46.002
Which one's who? I've gotta
get a picture of that.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.670
Mcbride... you're
on the end right here.

41:47.738 --> 41:49.205
I see.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.007
I-I need another drink.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.142
I think we hit the nail
on the head.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.411
Do you know about
next door upstairs?

41:55.479 --> 41:57.680
I know that there were
flats upstairs.

41:57.748 --> 42:01.317
On my great-great-grandfather's
death certificate,

42:01.385 --> 42:03.486
It says this is where
he passed away,

42:03.555 --> 42:05.321
14 upperkirkgate.

42:05.389 --> 42:07.223
Would've been right above
the bar, yeah. Yeah.

42:07.225 --> 42:09.225
Yeah, so the wake
would've been here.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.195
So they died right above us.

42:13.264 --> 42:16.499
I think... I think... I-I...
That's crazy.

42:16.567 --> 42:18.979
But... I mean, we've come this far
and it all leads to this bar.

42:19.003 --> 42:20.269
And it happened above us.

42:20.338 --> 42:21.904
I just feel it. I just feel it.

42:21.907 --> 42:23.105
Yeah, this is the spot.

42:25.109 --> 42:26.342
Watching you do this has been.

42:26.411 --> 42:27.777
Really fascinating,
I have to say.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.512
I've never had the desire
to look it up.

42:29.581 --> 42:31.247
I've been on my own for so long.

42:31.249 --> 42:33.082
That I've sort of
pushed it all back.

42:33.150 --> 42:35.262
It's been... it kinda makes me
wanna do it a little bit now.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.853
I'm glad we get
to do it together.

42:36.921 --> 42:38.841
Yeah, I'm glad we did it together.
Unforgettable.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.391
To alexander.

42:41.459 --> 42:42.792
Forget not.

42:44.563 --> 42:45.962
Yeah.

42:45.964 --> 42:47.897
What I can't understand.

42:47.965 --> 42:50.232
Is how I'm not
that crazy about whiskey.

42:50.301 --> 42:51.467
Maybe you're a rum girl.

42:51.535 --> 42:53.202
From the start,

42:53.270 --> 42:56.205
I knew this was destined
to be a different kind of ride.

42:56.274 --> 42:57.640
Being able to take this journey.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.408
Into the past with melissa.

42:59.411 --> 43:01.911
Has been
a truly magical experience.

43:01.979 --> 43:04.213
That we surely will forget not.
