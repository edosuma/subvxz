WEBVTT

00:05.547 --> 00:08.341
-(pounding on door)
-NORMAN: Police! Open up!

00:08.425 --> 00:09.634
-What the hell?
-(loud bang)

00:09.718 --> 00:11.928
Everybody up, come on!
You, Malcolm Nippler,

00:12.012 --> 00:14.305
-out of bed, let's go! Let's go!
-Soviet Russia, right?

00:14.389 --> 00:16.725
Here, a warrant. They got these in Russia?

00:16.808 --> 00:19.769
A man's in his home,
in his own bed with a lady,

00:19.853 --> 00:22.147
all of a sudden there's police,
no explanation.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.858
The explanation is you're
fencing stolen property.

00:24.941 --> 00:28.445
As in a certain heist
at Framer Brothers Appliance Warehouse.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.863
You see any stolen property?

00:29.946 --> 00:33.366
What I see is you're also a shy
and a small-time one.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.326
Couple hundred here, a half a grand there.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.245
All right, all right,
so I'm a small businessman,

00:37.328 --> 00:38.955
so why the KGB in the middle of the night?

00:39.039 --> 00:39.956
Lieutenant!

00:45.128 --> 00:47.589
You're under arrest... comrade.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.008
Item eight, people. Listen up.

00:50.091 --> 00:55.722
WTTY AM, once the only spot
on your dial for traditional jazz,

00:55.889 --> 00:58.016
has finally succumbed
to the public's appetite

00:58.099 --> 01:00.226
for vulgarity and changed its format.

01:00.643 --> 01:03.063
Something that would not
necessarily concern us,

01:03.146 --> 01:07.067
except the station inaugurates
its new programming today

01:07.150 --> 01:10.737
by sponsoring
an "Outrageous Acts" contest.

01:10.820 --> 01:15.617
-(laughter)
-Specifically, the station will pay $2,500

01:15.700 --> 01:17.535
to the person or persons

01:17.619 --> 01:21.748
who commits the most outrageous act
by six o'clock tonight.

01:22.165 --> 01:25.710
People, please know that a full spectrum
of misdemeanors

01:25.794 --> 01:28.088
will undoubtedly be performed
in public today,

01:28.630 --> 01:30.673
and to avoid the complete breakdown

01:30.757 --> 01:34.260
of our already overcrowded courts
and holding facilities,

01:34.344 --> 01:37.472
I urge you to exercise a Zen-like patience

01:37.555 --> 01:41.267
as well as wisdom
of the Hebroid King Solomon

01:41.351 --> 01:42.852
in your decisions to arrest.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.688
Hey, Lieutenant,
any restrictions on who could enter?

01:45.772 --> 01:51.778
-Outrageous acts, not sex acts, Detective.
-(laughter)

01:51.861 --> 01:52.862
Same thing to him.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.032
-(laughter intensifies)
-HOWARD: All right, item nine,

01:56.366 --> 01:59.619
as you are aware,
our neighbors to the east

01:59.702 --> 02:03.039
have sent us yet another
strain of Asian flu,

02:03.123 --> 02:06.126
further depleting our already
undermanned garrison.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.503
As a result, the following
assigns and reassigns:

02:08.586 --> 02:11.464
Parker rides with Adams,
Rowe with McKenna,

02:11.548 --> 02:13.258
Russo with Martin,

02:13.341 --> 02:16.386
and Sergeant Bates will once again ride
with Officer Flaherty.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.973
-J.D.: Hey, when's Belker coming back?
-(all murmuring)

02:20.056 --> 02:22.559
He's been out of the hospital
for over two weeks.

02:22.642 --> 02:27.897
Well, as I understand, he will know more
after he sees the doctor today.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.357
(all cheering, applauding)

02:29.440 --> 02:31.693
All right, all right, item last.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.863
After months of delay,
we finally received delivery

02:34.946 --> 02:39.576
of the first state of the art
completely computerized squad car,

02:39.659 --> 02:43.496
which will be driven
by our squad car lottery winners,

02:43.580 --> 02:46.916
Officers Andrew J. Renko and Robert Hill.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.002
(all groaning)

02:49.085 --> 02:52.422
Twenty bucks! I got 20 bucks
says a certain cowboy

02:52.505 --> 02:54.591
is going to get bucked by that big guy.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.509
-(laughter)
-Shut up, man.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.012
All right, gentlemen, one other note here,

02:59.095 --> 03:03.850
Teldar Industries has sent
a representative, Mr. Bob Ashahina.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.060
-Okay. What?
-That's his name.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.522
And he's to liaison with you
and answer your questions.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.274
You can ask his pronunciation of it.

03:11.774 --> 03:15.945
All right, if you have no questions of me,
ladies and gentlemen... dismissed.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.780
(all chattering)

03:19.240 --> 03:21.242
Hey, Sarge? (clears throat)

03:21.534 --> 03:22.744
Let's be up front about this.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.371
Uh, you don't have any problems
riding with me, do you?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.497
Nothing I can't handle.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.295
Come on down from there! You, sir!

03:33.755 --> 03:34.923
The hell is going on?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.802
We've tried everything, Lieutenant.
Those are weather balloons.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.471
He'll be up in the clouds
in a few minutes.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.889
Hey, you. Come on, flyboy.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.891
Let's go, you're creating
a public nuisance here.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.393
-Come on down.
-Not till I win the prize!

03:47.477 --> 03:49.562
-NORMAN: Come on, hey!
-Not till I win the prize!

03:49.646 --> 03:54.067
Hey, listen, Captain Kirk.
I said land it! Come on!

03:54.150 --> 03:56.319
Call the radio station
and get 'em out here.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.239
I don't have all day
to be messing with you, all right?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.324
I'm going to add resisting arrest.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.117
MAN: You gotta catch me first!

04:05.161 --> 04:07.163
You wouldn't. Not the balloons.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.332
This is your last chance.
Are you gonna come down?

04:10.083 --> 04:10.917
Uh-uh!

04:12.502 --> 04:13.920
-(gunshots)
-(air hissing)

04:14.420 --> 04:16.547
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:17.423 --> 04:18.675
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:18.758 --> 04:22.387
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:30.019 --> 04:32.939
(theme music playing)

06:23.925 --> 06:27.261
Oh, Howard, we should have a permanent
roll call sergeant next week.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.263
-Thanks for doing double-duty.
-Oh, no problem.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.432
I'll miss sending the men
out in the morning.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.436
The scent of camaraderie, male bonding
that's in the air, female, too.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.438
-Do you have a candidate in mind?
-Sergeant Jenkins.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.356
Oh, from the night squad.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.857
-Excuse me, Captain.
-He's a good man.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.192
It's already a half an hour late.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.278
This is gonna be some
great super cop mobile.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.198
Do you think we could stop by
the market when we're out?

06:47.281 --> 06:49.033
I just got something here for Daryl Ann.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.077
Yeah. Must've gone pretty
well last night, huh?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.621
No. I did exactly what
I said I wasn't gonna do,

06:53.704 --> 06:56.749
I was crawling like a baby to have her
come back to me, but I figured...

06:56.833 --> 07:01.379
(inhales) ...it's better to fight
and see her than not see at all.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.257
-What's in the box?
-Uh, it's this...

07:05.091 --> 07:07.260
-Ooh.
-Officer Hill, Officer Renko.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.304
-Sorry about the delay, fellas.
-RENKO: Yeah, we were kinda wondering.

07:10.388 --> 07:14.016
I stopped for gas and had a little trouble
with the shutdown command sequence.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.852
Shutdown command sequence?

07:15.935 --> 07:20.273
Oh, it's pretty easy once you learn.
Got to remember to enter "enter."

07:20.731 --> 07:22.024
(chuckles) It's all in here.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.111
Wait till you see it, state of the art.

07:25.361 --> 07:29.240
Its computer's not only tied in downtown,
so you can run a plate or a rap sheet,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.742
but it also keeps track
of the officers' activity.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.911
Everything, from idling time
to response time--

07:33.995 --> 07:34.996
BOBBY: Wait, wait, wait a minute,

07:35.079 --> 07:37.415
you mean this thing checks our performance

07:37.498 --> 07:40.960
and-and also records things
like how long we stay for coffee?

07:41.961 --> 07:46.674
He's getting out. They gave me no warning.
Tracy's arm hasn't even healed.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.302
He's supposed to be
in that hospital for six weeks.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.096
-It hasn't even been three.
-Darius appealed the commitment?

07:52.472 --> 07:56.309
Social worker called,
said he's getting out by this afternoon.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.813
Captain, this is Mrs. Milton and Tracy.
You remember Darius Milton?

08:01.564 --> 08:03.816
Put her arm in the door and he slammed it.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.401
NEAL: He's asking for early release.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.653
He has a hearing today
at the psychiatric court.

08:07.904 --> 08:13.284
It's not right. That boy is sick.
Can't anybody do anything?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.328
J.D. and I'd like to be there, Captain.

08:16.913 --> 08:17.914
If you have time.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.836
Hey. How you doing in school?
You keeping up like you promised?

08:25.296 --> 08:26.839
They gonna let my brother out?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.133
Hey, don't you worry
about a thing, sweetheart, okay?

08:29.217 --> 08:30.051
Come on, let's go.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.478
-Darius Milton?
-DR. SINGLETON: Darius, now, let's see.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.855
Oh, yeah, he's sitting over there
against the wall. Right there, see him?

08:53.699 --> 08:56.202
Darius? I'm Joyce Davenport.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.371
-I'm covering for Mr. Borgen.
-I'm not sick.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.500
Well, you're lucky.
Almost everyone I know has got a touch.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.127
(stammering) No, I mean,
if take my medicine.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.005
I take my medicine,
I'm just like other people.

09:08.089 --> 09:12.426
-I'm on top of this.
-Um... from your doctor's statements,

09:12.510 --> 09:14.136
I'd say today was just a formality.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.139
They don't want me home, that's fine.

09:17.223 --> 09:21.269
I-I get my SSI check
and I got a line on a job.

09:22.478 --> 09:27.024
I-I've been thinking about teaching,
or electronics, maybe.

09:27.275 --> 09:31.988
I-I got a place, 1601 Jefferson. A room.

09:32.405 --> 09:37.410
I-I take my medicine,
I get rest like they say...

09:39.328 --> 09:41.247
and I'll be like other people.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.917
I'm sure there'll be no problem.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.838
(alarm bell ringing)

09:48.921 --> 09:51.841
-Stop! Stop! Stop!
-(brakes squealing)

09:53.884 --> 09:55.845
Thanks God you're here.
This guy comes in and pull a gun.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.179
-Where?
-MAN: My drug store.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.056
There's a customer in there.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.602
A woman who wanted Epsom salt,
and my stock boy tell me--

10:02.685 --> 10:04.353
-That's my wife! That's my wife, man!
-Okay. Hold on.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.689
Hold on, man! Hey!

10:07.106 --> 10:10.610
-(clattering)
-(both yelling)

10:11.777 --> 10:14.030
Two-two-oh-three, robbery in progress,

10:14.113 --> 10:17.533
possible hostage situation,
331 West Lancaster.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.457
This is the police! We don't want anybody
to get hurt in there!

10:26.542 --> 10:27.460
PATRICK: Get out of here!

10:27.543 --> 10:31.172
As for whether Darius Milton
still suffers from such a delusion,

10:31.714 --> 10:34.467
I can only say that
antipsychotics are the key.

10:34.550 --> 10:38.596
But isn't a paranoid schizophrenic
like Darius Milton

10:38.763 --> 10:40.306
capable of violent behavior?

10:40.681 --> 10:43.142
Best guess?
Not if he stays on his medicine.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.936
(stammering) You see, I told you.
If I take my medicine, I'm just--

10:46.020 --> 10:48.064
But the boy don't take his medicine!

10:48.564 --> 10:51.067
Mrs. Milton, what leads you to believe
your son won't?

10:51.525 --> 10:54.320
Because I know him. I'm his mother!

10:54.403 --> 10:56.238
Don't you think his behavior
could have changed?

10:56.322 --> 11:00.493
Dr. Singleton testified he's demonstrated
a willingness to maintain a regimen.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.329
I'd like to call the arresting officer,
Detective Washington.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.246
JOYCE: Objection, Your Honor.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.000
Defense questions the relevancy
of Detective Washington's testimony.

11:08.376 --> 11:12.004
Since we are not attempting to deny
the proven circumstances of the arrest.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.590
-Uh, may I say something, Your Honor?
-JOYCE: That's the question, Your Honor:

11:15.132 --> 11:18.177
Is what Detective Washington
has to say permissible here?

11:18.260 --> 11:21.097
-I saw what Darius Milton did, Your Honor.
-Your Honor.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.975
Past criminal behavior is not our concern.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.853
Nor are we here to establish
the degree of sanity.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.855
I'm-I'm sorry about what happened.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.274
What I did,
but I-I was crazy when I did that.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.695
JUDGE: Are you finished questioning
Dr. Singleton, Mr. Gittens?

11:37.863 --> 11:40.783
There are only three points
on which we need pass judgment.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.537
Is Darius Milton a threat
to himself or to others,

11:44.620 --> 11:46.205
or is he gravely disabled?

11:46.831 --> 11:50.251
Expert uncontradicted testimony
asserts he is not.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.506
Court grants the patient
appeal for early release.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.424
(gavel bangs)

11:56.507 --> 11:57.925
Is my boy gonna have to
kill somebody first?

11:58.008 --> 11:59.301
Is that what it's gonna take?

11:59.552 --> 12:02.096
Don't come around us.
You leave us alone! Please!

12:02.430 --> 12:04.640
Didn't know psychiatric
was on your beat, Miss Davenport.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.559
-I'm just filling in, Detective.
-Mm.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.186
Another victory for the court system.

12:11.814 --> 12:15.151
(siren wailing)

12:21.157 --> 12:24.201
(helicopter blades whirring)

12:24.535 --> 12:27.121
MAN: Okay, folks, move back.
Stay back behind the line.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.249
HENRY (on megaphone):
Please, you inside the drug store,

12:30.332 --> 12:31.167
pick up the phone.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.836
Let's talk this out.
Nobody has to get hurt.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.131
Come on, figure out
what you want and tell us.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.967
-How long are you gonna wait?
-Long as it takes.

12:40.050 --> 12:43.137
We need reinforcements, Henry,
additional EATers at the perimeters,

12:43.220 --> 12:44.597
support for the entry team.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.016
Getting a little ahead of ourselves,
aren't we, Howard?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.351
In fairness, Lieutenant,
if we have to send a team in,

12:49.435 --> 12:53.481
I anticipate an access problem.
The only way in or out is the front door.

12:54.106 --> 12:57.860
There's no service entrance,
no loading dock, no roof access, nothing.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.947
And the back, the rear, is sealed off
with a quarter inch of metal plate.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.282
You know, this poor man...

13:03.365 --> 13:05.534
-(woman speaking indistinctly on radio)
-...has been burglarized so many times

13:05.618 --> 13:07.703
that he practically has to weld
himself in in the morning.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.246
-WOMAN (on radio): <i>Copy?</i>
-Got it.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.082
Of course, there's always tear gas.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.002
You're forgetting one of the hostages
is pregnant, Howard.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.463
Have Milligan move that
blue team to the left.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.631
HENRY: Listen to me...

13:18.714 --> 13:20.549
Milligan transferred
three months ago, sir.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.885
-That's Dodd now.
-HENRY: Please, pick up the phone...

13:22.968 --> 13:24.804
-Oh, I meant Dodd.
-...so we could talk.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.972
Let's cross, let's get out of the way,
come on.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.016
When are you guys gonna storm the place?
What are you waiting for?

13:29.099 --> 13:30.935
Hey! Don't cross that line.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.146
Thank you.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.649
-HENRY: Please, please pick up the phone.
-Coffee?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.610
HENRY: Please, pick up the phone.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.071
It's gonna be all right, sir,
you know, we're doing all we can.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.697
-It's gonna be okay--
-Hey, don't touch me, man!

13:43.781 --> 13:46.367
-HENRY: Please, pick up the phone.
-Look, why don't you cops just go?

13:46.450 --> 13:48.619
Huh? Why-why don't all you cops
just leave, man?

13:48.869 --> 13:51.080
(stammers) Then he'll split!
He'll let my wife go!

13:51.872 --> 13:53.374
Lieutenant Hunter? Lieutenant Goldblume?

13:53.457 --> 13:56.001
MAN (on radio): <i>I'm gonna kill the hostage</i>
<i>if the cops don't back off.</i>

13:56.085 --> 13:57.920
<i>What I'm saying, I want every cop gone.</i>

13:58.254 --> 13:59.296
MALE REPORTER:
<i>Those are the words of a man...</i>

13:59.380 --> 14:00.381
That's the guy in the store?

14:00.464 --> 14:02.508
He just called the radio station
a couple of minutes ago.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.760
HENRY: How could he?
The line keeps ringing in there.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.846
Check with the owner,
see if he's got two lines.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.223
-No! No! No! No!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:09.515 --> 14:10.432
Come on, come on.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.935
All right, hold your positions.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.821
(laughing) Don't be too long, Andy,

14:23.904 --> 14:26.198
you know, this machine
might tell the teacher on us.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.369
RENKO: There she is, right there.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.371
WOMAN (in computerized voice):
<i>You've left your keys in the ignition.</i>

14:32.454 --> 14:35.499
-I'm in the car. I'm still in the car!
<i>-You've left your keys in the ignition.</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:37.751
-Put this... Ouch.
-Stupid!

14:38.377 --> 14:41.130
(siren wailing)

14:42.590 --> 14:45.509
-Now, why is it doing that?
-A high-tech lemon, that's what it is.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.469
-Welcome to the computer age.
-I don't care.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.014
Daryl Ann?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.974
DARYL ANN: Andy, what are you doing
and why is your siren on?

14:52.057 --> 14:54.184
Daryl Ann, I just want to talk to you
for a minute, okay?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.561
No, you can't do this!

14:55.644 --> 14:58.480
You can't have your siren on
in front of my store!

14:58.564 --> 15:00.232
-But--
-You'll drive away business!

15:00.316 --> 15:01.483
Is this your idea of a joke?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.569
It's not a joke, I wanna give you some--

15:03.652 --> 15:07.823
-Will you please turn that off!
-I'm trying to turn this thing off!

15:07.907 --> 15:10.159
I knew we shouldn't have
gotten this car, I knew it.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.619
-Daryl Ann--
-Get out of here, now!

15:11.702 --> 15:14.121
-I-I bought you a present!
-No!

15:14.204 --> 15:16.332
I bought you a pre--
I bought you a present.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.917
-DARYL ANN: Go on!
-I don't even care what I got you.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.753
It's going nuts!
I don't know what's wrong with this car!

15:20.836 --> 15:22.212
-(siren stops)
-(car beeps)

15:23.422 --> 15:25.758
Well. Hey, you wanna go back
and ask her again?

15:25.841 --> 15:27.092
You know, try to explain?

15:27.426 --> 15:30.054
No, no, no, no.
She don't care about me and I...

15:30.137 --> 15:33.098
Wait, Renko, she probably never
even heard what you said--

15:33.182 --> 15:36.602
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Possible domestic</i>
<i>at 2301 Van Buren, apartment three.</i>

15:36.685 --> 15:38.812
<i>-Confirm and respond.</i>
-What is the call letters of this car?

15:38.896 --> 15:41.982
-Twenty-four-oh-three.
-Twenty-four-oh-three in response.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.317
-(engine starts)
-I don't understand this vehicle...

15:43.400 --> 15:44.693
-(car beeping)
-...and I don't understand her.

15:45.402 --> 15:48.614
What we were doing is perfectly natural.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.116
You two ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.995
Naked in a public park?
Going at it like two rabbits?

15:55.245 --> 15:57.498
Repressed. Definitely repressed.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.668
Are you familiar with the work
of Dr. Wilhelm Reich?

16:00.751 --> 16:04.672
We believe that all the world
should form a huge daisy chain of love.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.466
Raymond, book these two
for lewd conduct in public.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.551
I'll try to rustle up
some clothes for 'em.

16:10.678 --> 16:14.556
Excuse me, uh. How often do you two...

16:14.640 --> 16:16.350
Twice a day, at least.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.686
What goes on between a husband and wife

16:18.769 --> 16:23.190
should not be subject
to totalitarian interference from police.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.986
-You two are gonna win.
-Win? Win what?

16:27.319 --> 16:30.072
The Outrageous Acts contest.
You've got it nailed.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.616
We have not committed any outrageous act.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.912
We are pumping up the orgones.
Renewing the seed.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.623
You stay just like you are.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.963
It looks as though Nippler's action was
a small part of the Framer Brothers heist.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.632
He'll lead us to his senior partners
if we let him walk.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.844
-He wants to deal?
-I talked to the DA, he says to go for it.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.556
-It was a good bust, Norm.
-Okay, Captain.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.101
I got here as soon as I could.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.603
Good, thanks, Lucy.
Take over the front desk, would you?

17:05.274 --> 17:10.362
WTTY? Great, listen, uh,
you can put a lid on the contest right now

17:10.446 --> 17:12.573
'cause I got your winner right here.

17:12.781 --> 17:17.327
Mr. and Mrs. Nathan and Leona Schecter.
Two beautiful senior citizens.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.496
Now, we're not just talking about
outrageous acts here,

17:19.580 --> 17:21.623
we're talking about human interest.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.918
Huh? No. No, no, I'm not Mr. Schecter.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.921
I'm his nephew.
Yeah, I'm sort of their sponsor.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.089
Detective Washington.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.217
Darius just forced his way
into our apartment.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.219
That boy don't respect anything!

17:34.303 --> 17:36.805
-Did he touch you? Did he hit Tracy?
-(whimpers) He scared me.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.976
I was gone maybe ten,
15 minutes to get some butter.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.103
He asked, "Where's Mama?"

17:43.687 --> 17:46.690
I came back,
he's gone and my baby's crying.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.734
TRACY: I told him Mama wasn't there.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.570
And he started calling me things like,
"A whore."

17:52.029 --> 17:54.364
(whimpers) Am I gonna have to protect
me and my baby

17:54.448 --> 17:56.075
or are you gonna do something?

17:56.658 --> 17:58.786
Whatever else,
it's breaking and entering, J.D.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.956
Raymond. Can you get someone
to take a formal statement?

18:04.833 --> 18:07.044
-Yo, Officer, did someone squeal on us?
-What?

18:07.127 --> 18:08.837
-I heard somebody squealed on us.
-(snorting)

18:08.921 --> 18:10.589
You heard somebody squeal? (chuckles)

18:10.672 --> 18:12.925
Not yet, they didn't,
but they gonna squeal.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.176
-(snorting)
-Now!

18:14.259 --> 18:16.428
(squealing)

18:17.096 --> 18:18.472
-All right!
-Outrageous!

18:18.806 --> 18:20.182
We are winners for sure!

18:20.265 --> 18:21.683
(pig squealing loudly)

18:22.392 --> 18:25.437
-(all clamoring)
-(shrieking)

18:26.522 --> 18:29.233
(overlapping dialogue)

18:29.316 --> 18:33.570
-Get it!
-(pig squealing)

18:38.784 --> 18:40.994
-You got him, Captain!
-(squealing)

18:41.078 --> 18:42.287
Book the pig, Lucy.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.625
BOBBY: Why don't you see
if the thing works, okay?

18:46.708 --> 18:47.584
Which-which car do you want to do?

18:47.668 --> 18:50.003
-RENKO: The one with the gray. Yes, here.
-BOBBY: Okay.

18:50.087 --> 18:55.592
-(tapping keypad)
-BOTH: Four, five, nine, K-O-A-S-H.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.094
Enter... now.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.097
-BOBBY: Did you get a make?
-No. No, if I'm doing this right,

19:00.180 --> 19:03.559
I could have sworn the sedan was wanted
for about 20 traffic tickets.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.394
Oh, great, of course
it's out of the question

19:05.477 --> 19:07.187
that this remarkable machine...

19:07.271 --> 19:08.188
-Bobby wait, just wait.
-...could be in error.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.816
Hold it. Wait a second.
While we're here in traffic violation,

19:10.899 --> 19:12.484
let me just see
if I can punch up Daryl Ann--

19:12.568 --> 19:13.735
-No.
-Daryl Ann Renko, okay?

19:13.819 --> 19:14.903
-Renko, no--
-She's a cop's wife.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.823
She says the only advantage.
She says if you're a cop's wife,

19:17.906 --> 19:20.075
why can't you fix
some traffic tickets, okay?

19:20.159 --> 19:23.287
Let me just try. The machine owes me
and Daryl Ann something here.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.372
-(beeping)
-N-N-- Just--

19:25.455 --> 19:27.833
If I could just figure
out how this thing works!

19:28.250 --> 19:30.919
TRFX, enter. That's it.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.130
(buzzing)

19:33.630 --> 19:34.798
Screen went dead.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.554
-(car horn honks)
-SID: Norm!

19:41.430 --> 19:42.931
-Come on.
-(car horn honks)

19:43.682 --> 19:46.894
(laughs, mimics convertible motor)

19:48.353 --> 19:51.398
And you know what?
I swear, it drives better than it looks.

19:51.481 --> 19:52.941
That's the unbelievable part.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.361
No, the unbelievable part
is it drives at all.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.615
What are you talking about,
the hole in the floor?

19:59.698 --> 20:01.491
That's a dollar and fifty
worth of plywood, Norm.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.701
You got expect those things.

20:02.784 --> 20:03.952
-(car horn honks)
-Watch your ears.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.416
I don't have to ask where you got
the money to buy this chrome donkey.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.086
I see your down in Nippler's
accounts receivable book for a grand.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.422
Hey, when did I say
I wasn't into this guy for money?

20:15.505 --> 20:18.300
All I said is that he was a big mover
in the warehouse job.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.885
A mover, yes. Big, no.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.804
Right, but the main thing is
the tip was good, no?

20:23.305 --> 20:25.057
So speaking of accounts receivable--

20:25.140 --> 20:28.227
-We are talking very small time here, Sid.
-All right.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.312
You're lucky the guy
had something to sell.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.274
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying he dealt us his rabbis.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.152
What, and you put Nippler back out
on the street? That criminal?

20:37.444 --> 20:39.196
You guys call yourselves
protectors of the peace.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.074
Oh, right, this town's not safe
so long as Nippler's out there

20:42.157 --> 20:43.659
moving the hot toaster ovens, huh?

20:43.742 --> 20:45.244
-Wait a minute.
-Tough break, huh, Sid?

20:45.327 --> 20:48.288
-Now you're gonna have to pay your debts.
-Come on, Norm, listen.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.375
-Wait a minute, I'm in trouble.
-Sell the car, pay him back.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.629
-It's not that simple. Can we talk?
-(sighs)

20:57.256 --> 20:58.757
I cut a deal with Nippler.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.176
There's a guy
who's into him deeper than me.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.345
-And?
-And I said that I would be

21:03.428 --> 21:06.265
his bone crusher.
He'd wipe my slate clean.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.517
(chuckles) You collecting for a shy?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.185
Yeah, strictly on a one-time basis.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.521
Listen, why I heard that Nippler
was in the warehouse job,

21:12.604 --> 21:15.190
You sold him to me,
'cause you figured Nippler'd be away

21:15.274 --> 21:18.318
making little stones out of big stones
for a long time, right?

21:18.735 --> 21:22.030
(chuckles)
The tricks life plays on us, huh, Sid?

21:22.572 --> 21:25.575
-I'll see you around.
-Wait, Norm, come on, you gotta help me!

21:25.659 --> 21:27.869
I told you, sell the car, pay him back.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.872
What are you-- sell a dream?
A lifelong ambition?

21:30.956 --> 21:35.294
Ever since 88th Street, when Mickey Kurth
pulled up in front of us kids, this is it!

21:35.669 --> 21:40.882
-Sid! Sell the car! Huh?
-All right. My destiny is clear.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.303
I have got to do the manly thing.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.807
(engine starts)

21:50.809 --> 21:52.894
-(engine rattling)
-(car horn honks)

21:57.274 --> 21:59.067
Here's our mystery caller, Henry.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.611
Traced him to a telephone booth
a couple of blocks away.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.239
-Thought he'd win the contest.
-It was a coincidence, man.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.700
Kid got what he wanted. Got on the air.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.289
Webster, what's the word
on reinforcements?

22:12.456 --> 22:15.250
There's a traffic jam on Dekker,
and they're at 104th,

22:15.334 --> 22:17.044
and every light on the street
is all screwed up.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.795
Judas, 50 blocks.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.673
Well, tell him to get their tails
out of that van and hoof it.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.008
Forced march.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.388
-We was gonna name it Matthew.
-So you know it's gonna be a boy?

22:29.264 --> 22:31.016
Yeah. Yeah.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.393
Did you have that test?
What do you call it?

22:33.477 --> 22:36.563
Test? What test, man? I just know.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.567
Well, if something's happened to that man,
you can forget about it.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.486
-'Cause that sucker's dead.
-HENRY: Patrick.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.613
We have an idea, Mr. Dahlgren.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.281
There may be a way
we can break this deadlock.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.117
If you went to the precinct
with Officer Flaherty,

22:49.368 --> 22:51.620
you could look at some photos for us,
maybe spot the man who's in there.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.372
And leave my store? No way!

22:53.663 --> 22:57.209
It might work. If we knew who he was,
we could get family down here, something.

22:57.292 --> 23:00.128
Sure, sure. Then you end your thing
and people are swarming

23:00.212 --> 23:02.381
all over my store, my merchandise.
And I'm not even here.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.800
I'll take responsibility for your store.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.471
-Okay.
-All right, come on.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.223
MALE REPORTER:
How much money did you have?

23:11.306 --> 23:12.682
A hundred and twenty-three dollars.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.435
I was just counting it.
He comes in, he didn't see me.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.937
I hit the alarm and ran.

23:17.979 --> 23:20.148
Just ran out?
You were worried about the $100?

23:20.232 --> 23:21.316
-What's wrong with you, man? Huh?
-PATRICK: Hey! Hey!

23:21.400 --> 23:23.235
-What's wrong with you, huh?
-(overlapping dialogue)

23:23.318 --> 23:24.736
-Hold on!
-You worried about the money?

23:24.820 --> 23:26.154
-He's crazy! He's crazy!
-CHILDERS: I'll kill you, man!

23:26.238 --> 23:28.448
-I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
-Get off him!

23:28.532 --> 23:31.159
(groans)
I'll kill you! I'll kill you, man!

23:36.790 --> 23:39.751
She's lying! I didn't break down the door!

23:39.835 --> 23:43.505
Tracy said that 'cause she's angry
about what I did when I was crazy!

23:46.383 --> 23:47.843
-Did you touch her?
-DARIUS: No.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.094
-JOYCE: Did you threaten her?
-No!

23:50.011 --> 23:52.681
Did you say or do anything
Tracy might have thought was a threat?

23:52.764 --> 23:55.225
I just wanted to come home.

23:57.477 --> 23:59.855
-Tracy says you screamed at her.
-I was angry!

24:00.230 --> 24:01.690
Do you know what my mama did?

24:07.112 --> 24:08.947
She threw out all my clothes.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.874
She threw out all my clothes.

24:25.046 --> 24:25.881
Lucy.

24:27.174 --> 24:31.052
Have we given downtown a count
of the units working the traffic jam?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.430
Uh, I just did that.
I just got off the phone, Captain.

24:33.513 --> 24:36.183
-(snorting)
-Why isn't he in a holding cell?

24:36.266 --> 24:38.977
Well, it's a she, and, uh,
Raymond had an idea.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.480
Couldn't we keep her as a mascot, Captain?

24:41.771 --> 24:42.606
They're cleaner than dogs

24:42.689 --> 24:44.649
-and-and far more intelligent.
-No.

24:46.026 --> 24:49.362
-Sorry. Call Animal Control.
-They're on their way, sir.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.990
(snorting)

24:52.073 --> 24:55.285
Well, Winnie the Pooh...
its back to the cell for you.

24:56.786 --> 24:57.913
Winnie the Pooh was a bear.

24:59.414 --> 25:03.418
(squealing)

25:03.502 --> 25:04.336
Sarge...

25:06.213 --> 25:07.923
Childers is the guy that hit Dahlgren?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.674
-Yeah.
-He's on parole.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.260
Armed robbery, five years ago,
he did three.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.304
Thing is, since then, he's been clean.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.598
You know, he loses it today,
he hits the guy.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.725
If I were him I might've done
the same thing.

25:19.017 --> 25:19.893
Yeah, so?

25:20.644 --> 25:23.939
Well, I just get the feeling our friend
Dahlgren's gonna press charges.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.899
(scoffs) Patrick, he hit him.

25:25.982 --> 25:29.194
Yeah, but... you know what I'm saying.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.780
Yeah, you're saying, "Can we kick 'em?"

25:32.322 --> 25:34.449
And I'm saying
if Dahlgren wants to press charges,

25:34.533 --> 25:36.159
there's nothing we can do about it.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.881
Mick! What are you doing?
When are you coming back to work?

25:49.965 --> 25:52.551
-Uh, light duty in a week or two.
-Oh, great.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.553
Welcome back,
we didn't expect you so soon.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.681
Well, to tell you the truth, Captain,
it's only a very short visit.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.100
I gotta sign some disability stuff,
you know.

26:00.183 --> 26:02.477
Uh, gotta catch up
filing for my sick leave.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.813
-Did you drive here?
-No, Robin dropped me off.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.273
Stan's gonna pick me up later.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.149
-How is the sergeant?
-Fine, fine.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.111
He's fine. I'm fine.

26:11.278 --> 26:14.030
Detective Belker,
wonderful to see you well.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.449
Thank you. Uh, excuse me, please.

26:17.826 --> 26:22.998
Look, I've got some problems
with what your men did to Darius Milton.

26:23.206 --> 26:25.834
It's my understanding he was arrested
for breaking and entering.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.502
Neal, J.D., my office.

26:30.839 --> 26:34.718
Detectives LaRue and Washington
took the word of a 12-year-old girl

26:34.801 --> 26:36.469
who had reason to hate her brother.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.722
We don't have signs of forced entry
at the apartment.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.265
-Nobody got hurt.
-Is that right?

26:40.682 --> 26:42.350
-More or less.
-We can't hold him.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.186
JOYCE: I'd like assurances
he won't be further harassed.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.024
I don't know if Mr. Milton is sane or not,
but I do know you can't arrest somebody

26:49.107 --> 26:50.775
because you think
they're mentally unstable.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.945
What about his mother?
She and Tracy need protection.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.197
You want to put in for pass-byes,
I'll approve.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.954
(sighs) Pass-byes.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.165
Hey, you keep it packed in ice, Neal.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.376
Hey, look. Personal time, J.D.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.338
No problem, Stan.

27:14.257 --> 27:17.719
Don't worry, I got plenty to keep me busy.
I'll see you when you get here.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.346
This gets to you after a while.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.389
We appreciate your help.
I want you to know that.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.849
What's going on with my store?

27:23.350 --> 27:25.310
Nothing new,
that's why you're still looking.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.229
You could turn while we talk.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.652
You know, I was thinking
maybe you'd like to reconsider

27:33.735 --> 27:35.070
pressing charges on Childers.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.656
I mean, tempers got lost
out there, you know.

27:37.739 --> 27:41.826
-You understand that, the baby.
-Was I hit or was I not hit?

27:42.452 --> 27:44.287
Is this a police station? Are you a cop?

27:45.246 --> 27:48.375
And you want to know if a man is assaulted
does he want to press charges?

27:48.750 --> 27:49.584
Patrick...

27:51.252 --> 27:54.673
Every car radio on the block.
Planning on opening a store?

27:54.756 --> 27:56.883
Hey, I just bought these off a dude.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.177
MARTIN:
Yeah, did you buy the slim jim, too, pal?

28:02.013 --> 28:03.807
-MR. DAHLGREN: That's the guy!
-Which one?

28:03.890 --> 28:04.933
-MR. DAHLGREN: That's him!
-That's who?

28:05.016 --> 28:07.268
-The guy in the store!
-Which is the guy holding the hostages?

28:07.352 --> 28:10.188
Yes-- I mean, no!
He ain't in the store, he's here!

28:13.108 --> 28:14.359
Get the captain.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.320
(helicopter blades whirring)

28:17.404 --> 28:20.407
We were alone and then we heard the alarm,
and we ran to the back of the room,

28:20.490 --> 28:22.409
and we locked ourselves in the storeroom.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.536
And then there were sirens
and the bullhorns.

28:24.619 --> 28:27.706
So we figured the guy was still out there.
But there was no robber?

28:27.789 --> 28:29.582
He must've left
just after your boss ran out.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.917
So we were in there
for four hours for nothing?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.877
I'm sorry, there was no way we could know.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.922
-Where's my Ben?
-He's down at the station.

28:36.005 --> 28:38.591
-What for?
-There was a problem, he got in a fight.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.761
Is he going to jail?
He can't be in jail when the baby's born.

28:41.845 --> 28:42.846
I'll take you to him.

28:43.847 --> 28:47.392
Webster! Where are the reinforcements?

28:47.475 --> 28:49.185
Almost here, sir, three blocks away.

28:49.436 --> 28:53.148
Judas Priest. Well, tell 'em to return
to the van, double time!

28:53.648 --> 28:56.943
This is always my luck. I get a story,
there's no rabbit in the hat.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.904
Hey, Lieutenant,
all dressed up and nowhere to go?

28:59.988 --> 29:03.199
(laughter)

29:03.658 --> 29:06.911
Uh... Uh, listen, uh, listen, girls,

29:06.995 --> 29:09.372
-I want to find out where I could find--
-WOMAN: I already told you.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.000
We don't know no Dorine.
She don't hang here.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.461
Well, then, where does she?
She's a girl in her 20s,

29:14.544 --> 29:15.628
-lots of red hair. She's--
-Oh, I'm sorry!

29:15.712 --> 29:18.047
Hey, Sugar Pops,
what do you want other ladies for?

29:18.131 --> 29:19.299
You can have Patrice.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.843
-Fifty bucks, right?
-Uh-huh.

29:22.093 --> 29:26.556
Uh... here. Only, you gotta tell me
where I can find Dorine.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.016
I don't know no Dorine.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.851
-STAN: What do you mean--
-Hey, what's going on here?

29:32.604 --> 29:33.438
Sergeant Jablonksi.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.609
From the Hill, right?

29:38.818 --> 29:41.821
-Yeah, it's okay, everything's okay.
-OFFICER: You sure, Sergeant?

29:42.155 --> 29:44.240
Yeah. Look, uh, I'm just, uh...

29:44.574 --> 29:46.785
I'm just freelancing
for some of the local merchants here.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.579
And I'm... I'm trying to push 'em
over a couple of blocks.

29:49.662 --> 29:53.166
Why don't you do us a real favor?
Push 'em on over to the Hill, huh?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.376
-(laughs)
-Yeah.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.128
-Take it easy, Sarge.
-Okay.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.218
All right, now,
you tell me where I can find Dorine.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.929
-I don't know no Dorine. I told you that.
-Well, then give me my 50 bucks back!

30:06.012 --> 30:08.306
Either the name or I--
Ah, the hell with it.

30:08.932 --> 30:09.849
Darius.

30:12.685 --> 30:15.104
Darius. Hey, hey, Darius.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.023
Why are you hassling me?
I'm taking my pills.

30:17.106 --> 30:18.817
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, Darius. Okay.

30:18.983 --> 30:23.238
Look, I don't want to go back to County.
You don't know what it's like there.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.031
People mess themselves.

30:25.406 --> 30:28.243
You can't sleep at night 'cause
of all the screaming and the noises.

30:28.743 --> 30:31.371
There are all those people there,
but it's like you're alone.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.914
And they don't want to be out.

30:33.790 --> 30:38.336
I'm not like them. I'm taking my medicine,
I'm seeing my doctor, I'm all right.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.505
Someday, I'm gonna get married.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.842
Yeah, yeah okay, Darius.
Okay, but look, man, look.

30:43.925 --> 30:46.344
Just stay away from your mother
and your sister, okay?

30:46.427 --> 30:48.179
Look, it's all that Tracy's fault!

30:48.263 --> 30:50.390
She's trying to get me,
but I'm gonna get her!

30:50.640 --> 30:52.851
She keeps doing this to me
and I'm gonna get her!

30:52.934 --> 30:54.978
Hey, look here, man!
Now, you listen to me!

30:55.520 --> 30:57.480
If you're sane enough to be
out here in these streets--

30:57.564 --> 30:59.023
Look, man, if it weren't for that Tracy--

30:59.107 --> 31:02.110
Then you are sane enough
to understand what I'm saying to you.

31:02.735 --> 31:03.987
What do you want, anyway?

31:04.362 --> 31:07.156
If you so much as even breathe
on your mother or your sister,

31:07.240 --> 31:09.784
I'm gonna be all on you, you got that?
You got that?

31:11.870 --> 31:13.454
I'll stay away from them.

31:22.839 --> 31:23.756
Hey, Norman.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.593
I told you I'd do
the stand-up thing with the shy.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.762
-Sold the car and paid up?
-No. I made a deal.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.264
I don't go back on my word.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.559
Norm. Norm. Norm.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.064
I'm giving myself a selection.
Something my mother taught me.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.983
Always use the right tool for the job.

31:42.692 --> 31:45.320
Sid, you know I'm gonna have to
confiscate this stuff.

31:45.403 --> 31:46.237
Now, come on, huh?

31:53.286 --> 31:55.330
-(clanking)
-(clattering)

31:55.663 --> 31:58.541
That's it. Ninja.

31:59.626 --> 32:00.919
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.506
What the heck you gonna do to the guy,
sauté him to death? Now, get out of here.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.301
Hey, Norm, your attitude surprises me.
It shocks me.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.011
-You know I'm about to commit a crime.
-Go.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.930
-What, go? What, go and commit a crime?
-Yeah.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.681
Norm, what do you think I'm doing here?

32:13.765 --> 32:15.600
What do you think you're seein'?
I'm making a fool of myself--

32:15.683 --> 32:17.977
Sid, I don't have time for this,
all right?

32:18.436 --> 32:20.855
-(sighs) Okay. This is on your head.
-Go on. Yeah.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.440
This is one you saw coming.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.025
-Hey.
-Hey.

32:24.108 --> 32:26.861
Neal. How's our friend, Darius?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.322
-He heard me.
-Question is, did he understand?

32:32.450 --> 32:35.203
OFFICER: Yeah, yeah.
I got it right here. Okay. That works.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.630
-RAYMOND: Detective?
-Yeah, what is it?

32:46.839 --> 32:48.925
They just swept some hookers
over Westminster Boulevard.

32:49.008 --> 32:51.803
Uh, about eight of them. Pretty routine.

32:54.055 --> 32:54.889
So?

32:57.225 --> 32:58.101
This turned up.

33:01.187 --> 33:04.816
I ran the number.
It's, uh... Sergeant Jablonski's.

33:08.945 --> 33:09.904
Hmm.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.866
You told anybody else about this?

33:13.950 --> 33:17.203
No. I... I thought maybe
you'd want to handle it.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.204
Yes, I do.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.166
What about the hooker?

33:22.750 --> 33:25.336
Her name is Dorine. About a dozen priors.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.214
Real standard stuff.
You want to talk to her?

33:29.090 --> 33:30.466
No. I got it.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.553
Real standard stuff. Thank you, Raymond.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.268
-(telephone ringing)
-Detective LaRue.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.145
He's what?

33:42.687 --> 33:45.356
It's Mrs. Milton.
Darius is trying to bash in the door.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.108
Mrs. Milton? We'll be right over!

33:47.191 --> 33:49.235
Look, just stay calm, okay?
Just stay calm!

33:49.402 --> 33:51.738
Hey, Bev, Bev, talk to her.
Don't let her hang up.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.158
This is it for him. This is it for my Ben.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.452
His parole board hears about this and he--

33:57.535 --> 34:00.079
Lady, please, I have a headache.
Look, forget about the charges.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.707
Just let me go back and see
if the store is still standing, all right?

34:02.790 --> 34:04.292
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.211
DARIUS (yelling):
Mama, you let me come in now!

34:08.171 --> 34:09.047
-(banging on door)
-Darius!

34:09.130 --> 34:10.923
-DARIUS: Open this door, Mama, I mean it!
-Darius!

34:11.007 --> 34:12.425
-NEAL: Darius!
-(gunshot)

34:12.508 --> 34:14.552
-(groans)
-(clattering)

34:15.720 --> 34:18.723
(panting) Mrs. Milton!

34:19.474 --> 34:21.893
-It's Detective Washington!
-What's going on out here?

34:22.560 --> 34:25.813
Police officers. Call 911!
Tell 'em to send an ambulance!

34:29.067 --> 34:33.488
(groans) Mrs. Milton!
Please, open the door.

34:34.822 --> 34:35.823
(gun cocks)

34:40.036 --> 34:42.080
(sobs)

34:59.180 --> 35:01.724
RADIO DJ: <i>Boys and girls,</i>
<i>Cool Murray and the M&amp;M Man</i>

35:01.808 --> 35:06.354
<i>is proud to announce that the winner</i>
<i>of WTTY's Outrageous Acts contest is...</i>

35:06.437 --> 35:08.439
-(jingle playing)
-Come on, Murray, come on.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.775
<i>...the person or persons</i>
<i>who managed to mess up</i>

35:10.858 --> 35:12.610
<i>the traffic lights</i>

35:12.693 --> 35:16.781
<i>causing the worst traffic jam</i>
<i>in the city's proud history.</i>

35:16.864 --> 35:19.367
<i>-You are truly outrag--</i>
-(clicks off radio)

35:20.034 --> 35:21.119
I was robbed.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.580
-Some people are born lucky, J.D.
-I wonder how they did that?

35:24.664 --> 35:27.208
-Officer Renko?
-Mr. Ashahina.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.295
I have reviewed all your operations
with the computer during this workday.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.506
For reasons I won't speculate on,

35:33.589 --> 35:36.134
you attempted to access
the Department of Motor Vehicles

35:36.217 --> 35:38.261
-parking violations bureau.
-No, I did not.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.264
But instead tapped into the program
for the city's traffic lights...

35:41.347 --> 35:42.890
-No.
-...and destroyed the green-red sequence

35:42.974 --> 35:43.808
on Dekker Avenue,

35:44.267 --> 35:47.353
and in doing so caused
the worst traffic jam in recent history.

35:47.436 --> 35:50.148
The worst traffic jam
in recent history, I did?

35:50.231 --> 35:52.191
Did you hear that? (laughs)

35:52.275 --> 35:53.734
I don't know why you're so happy, Officer.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.612
You can be sure you'll never get
near our cars again.

35:57.363 --> 36:00.324
-Neither of you.
-Mr. Ashahina? I don't care.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.494
-Twenty-five hundred dollars.
-There's fines.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.080
-Fines?
-Non-official use of department property.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.958
-Wait.
-We can still clear a few bucks.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.711
Of course, that is if nobody
charges us with a felony,

36:11.794 --> 36:14.172
-illegal access to a computer or maybe--
-I get the picture!

36:14.255 --> 36:15.173
You found what?

36:16.591 --> 36:20.553
Judas H., that's astounding, compadre.
Of course, I--

36:21.095 --> 36:22.972
I will be there soon as I can get away
from here tonight.

36:23.055 --> 36:26.225
How far you want to go with this, Norm?
Arrest me, book me now?

36:26.309 --> 36:29.687
-You assaulted a man, Sid.
-Yes, right. But what sort of man?

36:29.854 --> 36:32.315
A man very capable of protecting himself.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.983
Come on, he was five-foot-one,

36:34.066 --> 36:35.943
he didn't weigh anything,
you attacked him.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.113
Yeah, right, and he almost killed me.
I admit in, self-defense.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.365
I'm not saying you should have
arrested him, but--

36:41.449 --> 36:43.117
Sit down, huh? Sit!

36:44.368 --> 36:45.870
(both sighing)

36:49.498 --> 36:52.293
All right, what's the quid pro quo?
That's all I ask.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.921
You and me, Norm,
there's always a quid pro quo.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.047
(sighs)

36:56.964 --> 36:59.133
-Come on, don't say, "Sell the car."
-Sell the car.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.260
Norm, it's not that simple.

37:01.344 --> 37:05.056
Don't get me wrong, it's a great machine.
Turns out there's some problems with it.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.433
I might not be able to get
full value back on it.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.185
I don't know whether you noticed,

37:09.268 --> 37:11.395
but there happens to be a good-sized hole
on the floorboard.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.856
I noticed.
Sell the car and I kill the bust.

37:13.940 --> 37:17.276
Ah. Okay, so I sell the car.

37:17.818 --> 37:21.781
Leave alone it's a once in a lifetime
dream come true,

37:21.864 --> 37:26.494
top of the wish list, classic
automobile lover's fantasy on wheels.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.496
I might get $200, 400 tops.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.333
I'm still 600 short to Nippler.
How am I better off?

37:33.793 --> 37:34.710
Stay right here.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.093
MRS. MILTON: He was quiet for a while.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.179
Then I could hear him moaning.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.350
Then he...
he just got violent again, and...

37:52.186 --> 37:55.856
I got the gun... and I shot him.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.818
Mrs. Milton, I'd advise you--

37:58.901 --> 38:00.444
MRS. MILTON:
Haven't you done enough, today?

38:00.778 --> 38:02.780
Now you're gonna advise me?

38:04.282 --> 38:06.701
Mrs. Milton, I'll be
handling this through arraignment.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.537
After that,
another PD will be assigned to you.

38:11.956 --> 38:12.790
Where's my daughter?

38:13.582 --> 38:15.293
She's with Detective Washington.

38:16.335 --> 38:17.211
Can I see her now?

38:17.503 --> 38:19.880
Well, let's finish taking
your statement first.

38:22.675 --> 38:23.718
What's gonna happen to her?

38:24.635 --> 38:27.638
A social worker's coming to take her down
to the County Children's Shelter.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.185
Captain, SID's preliminary
findings are in.

38:33.602 --> 38:34.478
Excuse me.

38:42.987 --> 38:46.490
Hey. Got you an orange.
They didn't have grape.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.575
Orange okay, Tracy?

38:48.075 --> 38:51.162
-(voice shaking) Thank you.
-You're welcome. Sorry, no straws.

38:52.913 --> 38:54.415
What's gonna happen to Mama?

38:56.125 --> 38:57.877
She's probably gonna have to go on trial.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.964
-Does that mean she's gonna go to jail?
-I don't know, sweetheart.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.720
I hate orange soda, I hate it!
(crying)

39:11.891 --> 39:13.934
(sighs)

39:15.353 --> 39:16.270
What's wrong?

39:16.937 --> 39:21.484
-It's, uh, it's not your wound, is it?
-No, no, doc says I'm coming along.

39:22.985 --> 39:24.070
What it is...

39:28.866 --> 39:31.619
-You lose this?
-Dorine.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.413
You got lucky, Stan.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.083
She was picked up in a sweep
before she could sell it,

39:37.166 --> 39:39.126
which is probably what she was gonna do.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.422
I was in a bar. She came around--

39:43.506 --> 39:46.092
-You don't have to explain--
-No, just do me a favor and listen.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.856
It happened. What can I say?

40:03.192 --> 40:07.738
(sighs) And afterward, I'm lying there,
she grabs my wallet and runs the hell off.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.240
-Stan--
-I can't even catch her!

40:11.283 --> 40:12.910
Twenty yards, I'm already puffing.

40:16.539 --> 40:17.873
Never felt so old, Mick.

40:21.001 --> 40:24.755
I'm... I'm responsible for this badge,
wherever it shows up.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.341
-If you're gonna file a report--
-It never happened.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.886
I'm not gonna have you in the soup
on account of me.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.389
The girl isn't exactly gonna complain

40:33.472 --> 40:36.350
because a stolen badge is missing,
all right? (chuckles)

40:38.018 --> 40:38.936
All right.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.731
-Okay.
-All right.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.066
That, uh...

40:45.276 --> 40:48.195
-That policewoman you married.
-Yeah?

40:48.946 --> 40:49.905
She never gave up.

40:51.615 --> 40:54.869
You're lying there, you got a hole in you,
she doesn't give up for a minute.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.579
-She's nuts about you, too.
-No, no, no, no.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.623
Listen to what I'm saying.
You don't take her for granted.

41:00.833 --> 41:07.089
You take care of yourself. You understand?
No... so you can be with her, Mick.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.053
For as long as you got.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.849
So long as you're together.

41:23.272 --> 41:26.066
Oh, Norm. I'm blown away.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.819
I am overcome with emotion.
You know, my entire life--

41:28.903 --> 41:31.155
You're working free
for the next six months, Sid.

41:31.238 --> 41:32.990
-Hey, wait a minute.
-Don't bother thanking me.

41:33.073 --> 41:35.951
No, listen, I'm just figuring,
now, let's be honest, Norm.

41:36.285 --> 41:40.080
Fifty dollars a tip, say what,
three tips a week for six months?

41:40.164 --> 41:42.082
-That's a lot more than this here.
-That's the deal, Sid.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.335
Or you're busted
and you're still in to the shylock

41:46.045 --> 41:48.339
-Well?
-Well, what?

41:48.422 --> 41:50.424
Now we got to pretend
you're giving me a choice?

41:54.512 --> 41:55.346
(door closes)

41:56.388 --> 41:57.765
(sighs)

41:58.516 --> 42:01.018
The gunshot residue test on your hand
turned out negative.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.189
Tracy's fingerprints are on that gun,
Mrs. Milton.

42:05.272 --> 42:06.774
Tell us what really happened.

42:10.778 --> 42:11.612
(sniffles)

42:13.572 --> 42:15.366
Tracy knew where the gun was.

42:16.575 --> 42:18.827
(voice breaking)
I didn't even know she-she had it.

42:20.913 --> 42:21.747
(sobbing)

42:23.207 --> 42:27.002
Please, don't take my baby.
Don't hurt her.

42:27.253 --> 42:31.173
(sobbing) Don't take my baby.
I lost my child.

42:31.465 --> 42:35.719
I can't lose another. (sobbing)

42:40.391 --> 42:43.227
(siren wailing in distance)

42:44.270 --> 42:45.396
(knocking on door)

42:48.691 --> 42:49.858
RENKO: Daryl Ann, it's me.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.906
(door unlocks, opens)

42:57.658 --> 42:59.618
What it is, I just came by
to see the baby, okay?

42:59.702 --> 43:01.829
And after I see the baby,
then I will go, okay?

43:03.622 --> 43:05.708
-You won't wake her?
-No.

43:06.917 --> 43:09.587
Um, and I brought back the keys
'cause I figured the way

43:09.670 --> 43:12.214
things are going between you and I,
I got no use for 'em.

43:16.051 --> 43:19.179
Okay. Go see her,
if that's what you came to do.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.068
Your daddy loves you, baby.

43:34.903 --> 43:36.280
You said you wouldn't wake her.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.876
Did you tell the preschool about us?

43:49.918 --> 43:50.836
I had to.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.048
They want to know
when there's something wrong at home.

43:55.924 --> 43:58.510
I know about your pride and everything,
but I had to tell.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.931
I didn't say nothin'. Nothin'.

44:07.061 --> 44:10.189
(sniffles) You know,
Laura keeps asking for her daddy.

44:12.691 --> 44:14.068
Yeah? What do you tell her?

44:17.363 --> 44:18.405
That he's working.

44:26.372 --> 44:28.248
Daryl Ann, I got something
I got to say to you.

44:28.332 --> 44:31.669
No way, Andy.
You came to see your daughter.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.171
-We got no talking to do.
-Daryl Ann, listen to me.

44:34.254 --> 44:37.424
I don't want to see you,
and I don't want anything from you. (sobs)

44:43.472 --> 44:46.433
Daryl Ann, I cannot live
unless I have you.

44:47.142 --> 44:49.019
That thing with Alice,
that don't mean nothing.

44:49.603 --> 44:51.605
It don't mean nothing if I don't have you.

44:56.151 --> 44:57.194
(sobbing)

44:58.862 --> 45:00.614
-Daryl Ann?
-I don't know.

45:02.991 --> 45:05.661
I think-- I think I know,
but I don't know.

45:07.996 --> 45:11.250
-But I can stay?
-I said I don't know.

45:12.376 --> 45:13.377
But you didn't say no.

45:16.296 --> 45:18.340
I got no idea what I'm feeling.

45:20.342 --> 45:21.593
Isn't that strange?

45:26.056 --> 45:27.725
(sobbing)

45:31.186 --> 45:33.480
(indistinct chatter)

45:36.775 --> 45:37.693
Where you been?

45:38.527 --> 45:41.321
Had to pick up Darius's stuff
from the Roffer Hotel.

45:41.822 --> 45:43.741
-His mother wanted it.
-What for?

45:44.616 --> 45:45.993
He was her son, J.D.

45:48.954 --> 45:49.830
(groans)

45:52.708 --> 45:55.210
-You all right, Neal?
-(exhales)

45:57.171 --> 46:00.549
No. Not on this one.

46:03.260 --> 46:04.720
You see all types of people.

46:06.930 --> 46:08.724
You see the way things go bad for 'em.

46:09.892 --> 46:13.937
(soft chuckle) Then you meet one
little person who gets under your skin.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.648
-Tracy.
-Tears you up.

46:19.568 --> 46:22.529
Juvenile courts can understand
where that girl was coming from.

46:24.531 --> 46:27.868
You know, Bible says
man is born to trouble.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.330
As the sparks fly upwards.

46:31.872 --> 46:35.667
Hey. Hey, man, you know,
we didn't make the world.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.051
I'm not staying.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.313
BILL: I got this place for a song, Howard.

46:56.730 --> 46:59.274
Been doing the renovation myself.
Weekends.

47:00.108 --> 47:03.070
So, I figure when it's finished
and I sell it,

47:03.570 --> 47:05.030
I'll probably double my money.

47:05.239 --> 47:08.200
Yeah. But there's that pride
of working with your own hands.

47:08.283 --> 47:11.829
Yankee ingenuity, pioneer knowhow.

47:12.037 --> 47:15.165
Oh, see these beams?
There is not a single nail.

47:15.249 --> 47:18.335
They're all pegs. I learned that
from that book you lent me:

47:18.502 --> 47:21.046
<i>Early American Carpenter</i>
<i>and the Myth of the Melting Pot.</i>

47:21.129 --> 47:24.258
(chuckles) Yeah,
that's a classic patriotic analysis.

47:24.716 --> 47:26.677
Yeah. When I started the renovating,

47:26.760 --> 47:30.347
I'd heard a rumor that the house was built
on an old Indian burial ground.

47:30.430 --> 47:36.603
And then, when I dug up this concrete,
you could see the end of a bone.

47:39.648 --> 47:41.483
-Could be Iroquois, Bill.
-Oh, wow.

47:42.192 --> 47:44.444
Yeah, look there's a-a tool or a--

47:44.820 --> 47:47.865
Is that a ceremonial object sticking out
from under the skull there?

47:49.366 --> 47:51.410
-Have you got a shovel?
-Yeah.

47:53.996 --> 47:56.874
Maybe we should let
the museum people do this, Howard.

47:57.457 --> 47:59.126
(wood creaks)

47:59.209 --> 48:00.794
-(clattering)
-(both scream)

48:00.878 --> 48:03.255
(electricity crackles)

48:13.932 --> 48:16.935
(closing theme playing)
