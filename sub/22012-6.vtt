00:01.402 --> 00:03.037
ADULT ADAM: The '80s was
a golden age of advertising,

00:03.104 --> 00:04.772
filled with famous faces.
Oh, hi, Vern.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.208
They talked fast and pitched
to us every day.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.110
Hello.
I'm Orville Redenbacher.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.578
Mikey liked it!

00:10.644 --> 00:12.213
He liked it!
And the
"Where's the Beef?" lady

00:12.280 --> 00:14.315
needed to know
exactly where the beef was.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.716
Hey, where's the beef?

00:15.783 --> 00:17.851
And there were local pitchmen,
like Crazy Eddie.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.020
It's Crazy Eddie's greatest
Fourth of July sale ever!

00:20.088 --> 00:22.390
ADULT ADAM: Even Jenkintown
had its own
commercial celebrity...

00:22.456 --> 00:24.458
My dad's competition,
the Formica King.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.294
Are you looking for a bed,

00:26.360 --> 00:28.162
a table, a wall unit?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.497
ADULT ADAM:
He was wild, kooky,

00:29.563 --> 00:31.165
and the bane of
my dad's existence.

00:31.232 --> 00:34.668
Come see me, Formica Mike,
the Formica King!

00:34.735 --> 00:36.737
We got deep discounts
on all your favorite

00:36.804 --> 00:39.740
brightly-colored furniture
in space-age laminates!

00:39.807 --> 00:42.476
And we're slaying
the competition!

00:42.543 --> 00:46.080
(ON TV)
* Furniture deals
on everything

00:46.147 --> 00:48.949
* Come on down
to the Formica King *

00:49.016 --> 00:51.785
Ask for me! Mike!
Or Luis.

00:51.852 --> 00:52.953
He works here, too!

00:53.020 --> 00:54.322
ANNOUNCER:
The Formica King's

00:54.388 --> 00:55.523
an authorized
Formica laminate dealer.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.358
* Do-do, do-do-do,
do-do, do... *

00:57.425 --> 00:59.493
Are you humming the jingle
of my sworn enemy?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.962
No.
Totally unrelated.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.431
* Formica King

01:03.497 --> 01:05.766
All right, that's it.
I'm sleeping on the couch.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.901
ADULT ADAM: My dad
hated the Formica King

01:07.968 --> 01:09.337
and couldn't get away
from him.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.972
Look! The Formica King
has a regal summer sale!

01:12.039 --> 01:14.808
"Big kingdom furniture
for lil' kingdom prices."

01:14.875 --> 01:17.044
(GROANS)
Murray, you gotta
hit this schmuck back

01:17.111 --> 01:18.879
before he drives us
out of business.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.581
Dammit, I know!

01:20.648 --> 01:22.316
ADULT ADAM:
My dad had to make
his own commercial,

01:22.383 --> 01:23.784
and there was only one geek
who could save him.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.820
I never thought I'd say this,
but bring me Adam.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.323
I've been waiting for
this moment my entire life.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.292
I know your taste.
It'll be quick and simple.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.426
Also, you'll be sitting.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.195
Oh, I like this idea.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.664
Or... And I'm just
talking out loud here...

01:36.730 --> 01:40.434
What if instead of
simple, we made it
incredibly complicated?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.136
Ooh, I'm listening.
No, no.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.104
Do not encourage him.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.274
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, my dad's brother and
unreliable employee Marvin.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.608
Let the selling begin!

01:47.675 --> 01:49.042
ADULT ADAM:
He was full of bad ideas,

01:49.109 --> 01:51.212
and my dad hated all of them.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.813
We have an opportunity here
to make the biggest,

01:52.880 --> 01:55.149
most expensive furniture
commercial ever, okay?

01:55.216 --> 01:58.552
I'm talking about explosions,
car chases, furniture girls.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.688
There's no such thing
as furniture girls.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.923
Uncle Marvin's right.
We should probably go big.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.258
So big!
And loud!

02:04.325 --> 02:05.626
And sexy!
Go away!

02:05.693 --> 02:07.395
Ooh!
We can set it in space!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.197
* Space
No space!

02:09.263 --> 02:10.931
And animals.
We need animals.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.065
The deadlier the better.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.301
Yes, people
respond to fear.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.868
Not furniture buyers.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.437
And we need epic stunts.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.239
How many sleeper sofas can
you jump in a monster truck?

02:18.306 --> 02:20.408
Well, if we load it up
with rocket fuel,
an infinite amount!

02:20.474 --> 02:22.443
When you're done,
we'll do it my way.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.811
Knock yourselves out.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.479
(GASPS) That's it.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.680
We wrap the whole thing up

02:26.747 --> 02:28.449
with a Rocky Balboa/
Apollo Creed

02:28.516 --> 02:30.251
final freeze frame.
Let's rehearse it.

02:30.318 --> 02:33.421
(IMITATING SYLVESTER
STALLONE) Well, I don't
usually rehearse, but okay.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.223
* I'm twisted up inside

02:35.289 --> 02:38.326
* But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say

02:41.495 --> 02:42.996
* I don't know the future

02:43.063 --> 02:46.534
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:46.600 --> 02:48.669
ADULT ADAM: It was
November 1, 1980-something,

02:48.736 --> 02:50.938
and my brother was about
to bust some moves.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.573
Yo, yo!
Look at this.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.175
The KFC has come to hang out
under the bleachers.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.278
No, it's the JTP.
ALL: JTP!

02:57.345 --> 02:59.480
And it's your lucky day,
'cause Big Tasty

02:59.547 --> 03:00.948
cordially invites you
to have dinner with him

03:01.014 --> 03:03.317
at Jenkintown's most
exclusive, romantic eatery.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.519
ALL: Tony Roma's!
Place for ribs!

03:05.586 --> 03:06.854
All right, bleacher creatures.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.089
Stop being all sketchy
and get to class.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.624
Nice try, dude.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.925
Mr. Glascott,

03:11.992 --> 03:14.127
I was about to go out
with Jamie Weisman for ribs.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.430
Everyone knows that's the most
romantic part of the pig.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.831
Except for the heart.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.066
Actually, I saved you.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.369
Seriously, man, you were
going down in flames.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.770
Trust me, I know.

03:22.836 --> 03:23.804
You do know.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.906
Hey, it's different
when I say it.

03:25.973 --> 03:29.443
Gah! That's the third girl
this week who shot me down.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.778
Don't these smoking hot
scrubs

03:30.844 --> 03:32.746
know I dated Lainey
for three years?

03:32.813 --> 03:34.014
Don't ask me, dude.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.383
I haven't talked to a girl
since my piano teacher

03:35.449 --> 03:37.050
told me
to stop calling her.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.552
It's like the only people who
see me naked now are you guys.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.388
I used to have great luck
with women,

03:40.454 --> 03:42.122
but it all dried up
when I started hanging
out with you dudes.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.524
Coincidence, Matthew.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.892
Man, I do not miss
being single.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.794
I'm just so happy
I have Erica, ya know?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.729
You're so lame, Geoff.
We don't have to hear it.

03:48.796 --> 03:49.897
Wait, that's it!

03:49.963 --> 03:52.266
It's been in this house
the whole time!

03:52.833 --> 03:54.302
Erica's bedroom.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.437
There has to be
some answers in here.

03:56.504 --> 03:57.705
Okay, guys,
this is, like,

03:57.771 --> 03:59.139
a huge invasion
of Erica's privacy.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.541
Dude, she's my sister.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.942
I know her
better than anyone.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.911
She'd do anything
to help us out here.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.079
Erica's very upset
and wants to talk to you.
Really, dude?

04:06.146 --> 04:08.416
I know you're her brother,
but she's really pretty.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.285
(SIGHS)
Barry. I will say this once.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.721
Leave my room,
or I will end you.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.623
Aw!
You are so sweet.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.592
Guys! She said, "Go for it."
We're good to go.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.394
Put Geoff back on the phone
right now!

04:20.461 --> 04:22.229
Yo, Geoff,
she says she loves you,

04:22.296 --> 04:23.497
and you're, like,
totally the one.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.198
I've been waiting
for this moment!

04:25.265 --> 04:26.700
If you don't get out
right now,

04:26.767 --> 04:29.169
so help me God,
I will get on a bus and...

04:29.236 --> 04:30.571
No, you're the best.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.772
Geoffrey, tackle Barry!

04:31.839 --> 04:33.774
Love you.
Punch him in the nards!

04:33.841 --> 04:36.677
We officially have
Erica's blessing.
Let's do this!

04:36.744 --> 04:38.679
Naked Rob, you and I
shall play the board game

04:38.746 --> 04:40.781
where you literally
become a woman...

04:40.848 --> 04:41.782
"Girl Talk."

04:41.849 --> 04:43.717
Matthew, you take
this Caboodle

04:43.784 --> 04:45.319
and make friendship
bracelets for all.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.355
One of you lucky bros
is gonna get an anklet.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.323
Andy, you read
these Judy Blume books.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.024
Soak up
all the teenage lady writing

04:51.091 --> 04:53.060
and see if God
ever responds to Margaret.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.362
I hope it's a yes.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.530
Geoff Schwartz,
you take Erica's diary

04:56.597 --> 04:58.599
and read her inner-most
secret girl thoughts.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.300
She's never let me
read it before!

05:00.368 --> 05:01.535
She finally trusts me!

05:01.602 --> 05:05.205
Gentlemen,
our world changes today.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.807
Let's get feminine.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.880
Okay, our big commercial's
all done.

05:12.946 --> 05:16.216
Yep. There's no story,
there's no effects,

05:16.283 --> 05:18.185
there's no artistic
expression whatsoever.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.888
I've never been more proud
of the kid in my life!

05:20.954 --> 05:24.057
Are you looking for
high-quality furniture

05:24.124 --> 05:25.426
at low prices?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.461
Come on down
to the Ottoman Empire...

05:27.528 --> 05:31.064
Huh! Where I will personally
fight high prices.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.966
I am the Sofa Samurai,

05:33.033 --> 05:36.470
and I will erase
the bloodlines
of the competition!

05:36.537 --> 05:38.305
(GRUNTS)
What the hell was that?

05:38.372 --> 05:41.442
Don't ask me!
Marvin taped over
my commercial!

05:41.509 --> 05:42.910
ADULT ADAM: And that's
when things got weird.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.312
My Uncle Marvin
hijacked the commercial.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.247
He was a space man...
(LASER BLASTS)

05:47.314 --> 05:48.348
Who was a lifeguard...

05:48.416 --> 05:50.117
No credit? No problem!

05:50.183 --> 05:51.351
I'll save you!

05:51.419 --> 05:52.753
ADULT ADAM:
...who had a cyborg arm.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.987
And I've been rebuilt
by the government

05:54.054 --> 05:55.523
to fight crime
and high prices.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.757
ADULT ADAM:
It was a disaster.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.159
So, come on down
to the Ottoman Empire.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.728
And bring the kids.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.163
They can swing my sword
around and chop up stuff.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.665
Ding!
Freeze, freeze.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.368
ADULT ADAM:
It was classic Marvin,

06:08.436 --> 06:09.570
and my dad had seen enough.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.904
How do you do it, Marvin?

06:10.971 --> 06:13.173
How do you literally
screw up everything?

06:13.240 --> 06:14.475
What?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.076
If anything,
I spiced it up with swords

06:16.143 --> 06:18.078
and time travel
and furniture girls.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.547
What's their story?

06:19.613 --> 06:21.048
Tiffany and Megan.
They're actually good people.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.850
I hope you don't mind.
I had to pay them in chairs.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.185
I do mind!
You can't just give away
our furniture

06:25.252 --> 06:27.387
and promise that kids
can play with swords!

06:27.455 --> 06:28.656
This is insane!

06:28.722 --> 06:30.691
I'm not airing
this stupidity. Ever.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.925
Ooh.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.827
"Ooh"? What do you...
What do you mean, "Ooh"?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.563
What if I told you
there was a world

06:35.629 --> 06:38.165
where people will see it
or have absolutely seen it?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.667
Which is it?
Both.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.401
I knew that you wouldn't
understand my vision, Mur,

06:41.469 --> 06:42.803
so I had to go
behind your back,

06:42.870 --> 06:44.438
and I handed it off
to the local affiliates.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.939
Wait.
This already aired?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.842
Okay, calm down.
The man means well.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.478
You realize
that's the worst thing

06:50.544 --> 06:51.712
you can say about a person.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.981
How is it bad
if a man means well?

06:54.047 --> 06:56.216
Because it means
he doesn't do well.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.185
He's too busy
being a moron.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.787
That's it!

06:59.853 --> 07:01.722
I refuse to work for someone
who thinks so little of me!

07:01.789 --> 07:03.356
Great. Then don't
come in tomorrow.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.892
Are you firing me?
No, you just quit.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.760
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just refusing to work.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.762
That is quitting.
Which I didn't do!

07:08.829 --> 07:10.130
Then fine.
You're fired.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.465
No, no, you can't fire me.
I already quit.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.700
Too late.
I fired you first.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.067
Okay, so rehire me
so I can quit.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.536
You're rehired.
Go ahead and quit.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.837
I'm staying.
Then you're fired.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.338
You would fire
your own brother?

07:18.405 --> 07:19.406
I quit!

07:19.473 --> 07:21.475
He means well.
(GROANS)

07:21.542 --> 07:23.043
ADULT ADAM:
As my uncle was quitting,

07:23.110 --> 07:25.178
Barry and his pals were
ready to give up on girls.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.914
Dude, "Girl Talk" sucks.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.882
The only thing
I've gotten from this game
is a bunch of zit stickers.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.418
And I admitted I had a crush
on the hunky quarterback,

07:31.485 --> 07:32.753
and he's so not my type.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.688
You need a guy
who makes you laugh, man.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.990
Andy? You have better luck
with that Judy Blume book?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.927
You have no idea what women
go through each month.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.061
I mean, it's crazy.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.330
It still won't help us
get dates, but...

07:43.396 --> 07:44.598
It's crazy.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.233
Maybe the ol' Bevernator
can help you

07:46.299 --> 07:47.400
with your lady troubles.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.503
Mom!
Stop invading our privacy

07:49.570 --> 07:51.572
while we're invading
Erica's privacy!

07:51.639 --> 07:53.607
Maybe this is a chance
for our relationship

07:53.674 --> 07:55.676
to change for the better.
It can't change.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.645
Once you're a lame mom,
you're always a lame mom.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.079
Well, once you graduate
from high school,

07:59.146 --> 08:00.814
you're not gonna need
a mom anymore.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.216
You're gonna need a friend
who knows things.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.985
I want to be that friend.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.119
Your lady bro.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.055
Dude, a lady bro
is exactly what we need.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.790
No. Last thing we need
is for you

08:09.857 --> 08:11.992
to mom us up
with corny mom advice.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.861
That is quite possibly
the most hurtful thing

08:13.927 --> 08:15.095
you've ever said to me.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.664
I am so much more
than just a mom.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.998
Now eat your prunes

08:18.065 --> 08:19.533
so you can get
your tummy engine cookin'.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.601
No prunes!

08:20.668 --> 08:22.369
They're just so...wet.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.737
It's been four days, Barry.

08:23.804 --> 08:24.872
You need to make.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.139
Mom.
(MURMURS) I'm fine.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.875
You know,
Essie Karp's nephew's son

08:27.941 --> 08:29.242
held it in for that long,

08:29.309 --> 08:30.811
and then he got on a ferry
to Nantucket...

08:30.878 --> 08:32.713
I don't wanna hear
this stupid mom story.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.382
They had to turn
the boat around, Barry.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.250
I don't care
about Essie's nephew's son!

08:37.317 --> 08:40.253
A Coast Guard chopper
was involved.
Mom.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.923
People were jumping
into the ocean.
Mom!

08:42.990 --> 08:44.958
They had to decommission
the boat.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.695
Mom!
Because he didn't eat
his prunes.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.196
I think
you've proven my point.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.631
Well, suit yourself.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.866
But just know that the most
attractive trait in a man

08:52.933 --> 08:55.135
is when he makes
on schedule.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.904
No, Naked Rob!
Drop the prunes!

08:56.970 --> 08:58.939
Oh, sorry, dude.
I need these prunes,

08:59.006 --> 09:01.041
and I need a lady bro
to help me get a lady, bro.

09:01.108 --> 09:04.111
My mother is not the answer,
Naked Rob.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.479
Okay, see, that's
the problem right there.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.181
This whole naked thing,
Robert.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.183
Girls don't like it
when you run up to them

09:10.250 --> 09:11.251
with no pants on.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.620
Don't listen to her!

09:12.686 --> 09:14.822
Your nudity is
your most redeeming quality.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.456
So you're saying if I get
dressed in the morning

09:16.523 --> 09:17.758
and stay that way all day,

09:17.825 --> 09:19.226
then women will be
less revolted by me?

09:19.292 --> 09:21.729
I'm not just saying it.
I know it.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.765
Fine! But I guarantee
this will not work.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.602
Dude.
I can't believe it.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.671
My mom
actually helped the guy.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.205
Um, could you tell
your friends to go?

09:32.272 --> 09:34.942
No, Debbie!
I'm watching
and learning.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.744
Guys, please. This is
a big moment for me.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.212
Do you guys actually think
my mom isn't just a mom?

09:39.279 --> 09:40.280
Accept it, man.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.150
She's the answer
to all our problems.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.685
ADULT ADAM: While Barry
had to admit defeat,

09:44.752 --> 09:47.454
Uncle Marvin was ready
to take a victory lap.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.622
What's going on?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.223
Why are you here?
I thought you quit.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.626
(LAUGHS) Don't worry
about me, Mur-Man.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.794
I'm just here
to let you know

09:53.861 --> 09:55.262
that I landed
a sweet new job.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.031
Oh, did you, now?
Oh, yes, I did.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.433
And I finally have
a real boss.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.102
One that I can respect.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.605
(PLAYS FANFARE)

10:05.673 --> 10:06.907
Make way

10:06.974 --> 10:09.509
* For Formica
Michael Mikowitz *

10:09.576 --> 10:11.444
Well, well, well.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.113
What do we got here?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.749
A whole lot of
crappy furniture
with no one to buy it.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.317
So, you're working
for this putz now?

10:17.384 --> 10:19.787
That's right.
I just snaked
your top salesman.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.388
Must be killin' ya.
No, I'm good.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.090
No, but he's your brother,
and now he's working for me...

10:23.156 --> 10:24.792
The enemy.
Yeah, well, things happen.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.660
Wow. That's, uh...

10:26.727 --> 10:27.961
That's not the reaction
I was expecting.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.362
(CHUCKLES)
Look at him.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.964
It's eating him up inside.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.000
I don't know.
He doesn't seem so
put out by the whole thing.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.035
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
You don't know him
like I do.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.636
He is dying to take me back.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.105
Okay.
I'll come back.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.240
Bup bup!
Nope, you see the sign.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.143
Says "No refunds
on damaged goods."

10:43.210 --> 10:44.144
Hoo-hoo!

10:44.211 --> 10:47.948
(LAUGHING)
Oh, he's such a faker.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.217
This is gonna be great!

10:50.283 --> 10:51.819
I got concerns.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.456
ADULT ADAM: It had been
two days since

10:56.523 --> 10:58.058
my Uncle Marvin's
crazy commercial had aired,

10:58.125 --> 10:59.559
and when my dad
arrived to work,

10:59.626 --> 11:02.129
he was surprised to find
business was booming.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.697
What's with
all the people?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.565
It's Marvin's
farkakte commercial.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.200
I think
it actually worked!

11:07.267 --> 11:10.170
No way. No one's here
to see a sweaty samurai.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.205
Hey,
where's the Sofa Samurai?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.341
My kid wants to take
a whack at this recliner
with that katana.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.110
Unfortunately,
the Samurai is sick.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.512
What? I drove two hours
to get here.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.114
Uh, which is why

11:21.181 --> 11:24.584
you're looking
at the Mattress Magician!

11:24.651 --> 11:27.554
What's that behind
your ear, huh?

11:27.620 --> 11:28.856
Don't touch my son.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.992
Uh... Give us a second.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.795
You gotta get
your brother back.
We need him.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.529
You know, we're talking
about Marvin.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.098
I've never once needed him.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.266
Until now.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.502
His terrible ideas,
turns out, are great.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.004
(GROANS)

11:44.071 --> 11:46.273
Fine. You don't want
Marvin's help.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.607
I'll work on my magic.

11:47.674 --> 11:50.010
Say, what's that
behind your...
Aah! Stop it.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.544
I'll go talk to him.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.246
ADULT ADAM: That day,
my dad wasn't the only one

11:53.313 --> 11:55.548
who was asking for help
from the least likely person.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.884
Double coupon?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.451
Don't mind if I do-pon.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.387
ADULT ADAM: Yep,
the unthinkable happened.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.890
Barry went to my mom
for some girl talk.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.225
Hey, Boofaloo.
(SIGHS)

12:05.292 --> 12:07.694
As much as it shocks me
to say it,

12:07.761 --> 12:10.563
you're not just a big-haired,
mom-shaped sweater lady.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.065
Hurtful, but continue.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.167
You helped Rob, which means
you're not only a mom.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.469
You could actually be
a lady bro
and help me get girls.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.671
(GASPS) Shut your
delicious little face!

12:18.738 --> 12:20.040
You asked for my help!

12:20.107 --> 12:21.541
Forget it! Forget it.
This is a mistake.
Wh...

12:21.608 --> 12:24.912
No, Barry,
look into my eyes.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.780
I will take this
more seriously

12:26.847 --> 12:29.382
than anything
I've ever done in my life.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.219
I just wanted some advice on
how to impress Jamie Weisman.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.187
I've already tried
both aggressive rapping

12:34.254 --> 12:36.256
and casual flexing
in a yellow tank top.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.457
Uh-huh.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.492
Have you considered
something simpler?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.294
You mean like eating
an entire apple in one bite?

12:41.361 --> 12:43.630
Or. What if
you just talk to her?

12:43.696 --> 12:45.966
Like with a bullhorn?
For now, just be yourself.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.734
That's all women
really want.

12:47.801 --> 12:48.869
Sincerity.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.470
Be sincere.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.640
So I speak with a British
accent and wear a monocle?

12:53.706 --> 12:54.875
We'll get you there.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.443
ADULT ADAM: And she did.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.211
After a little training
from his lady bro,

12:58.278 --> 13:00.981
Barry was ready
to win over his lady.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.650
Whoa, whoa.
What am I
looking at here?

13:03.716 --> 13:05.118
Just a boy
who took my advice

13:05.185 --> 13:07.855
and is now chatting
to his future girlfriend.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.589
Are you nuts?
What? What's wrong?

13:09.656 --> 13:12.359
Jamie Weisman hangs
with the no-good
bleacher creatures.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.361
They spend every lunch
under there smoking

13:14.427 --> 13:16.429
and listening
to that awful ska music.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.565
And don't get me started
on the truancy.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.367
Truancy?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.402
Well, that's a gateway
to being late
for everything in life!

13:22.469 --> 13:24.972
And the worst part is,
they're always sassing off
at the mouth,

13:25.038 --> 13:27.107
saying things like,
"(BLEEP) this school"

13:27.174 --> 13:28.708
and "(BLEEP) Mr. Glascott."

13:28.775 --> 13:30.210
Kids can't speak that way.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.845
This is
un-(BLEEP)-believable.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.346
Barry will not be
a part of that group.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.148
Now, there's the woman
I know and fear.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.117
Now get in there and break up
that boy's good time!

13:37.184 --> 13:38.685
Well, I just
became his bro.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.320
I can't go back
to being his mom.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.956
But you're the mommiest mom
of all the mom I've ever met.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.024
I don't know what to do!

13:44.091 --> 13:46.259
What you always do.
Ruin things.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.028
Well, I'd love to,
but I just can't get...

13:48.095 --> 13:49.562
Oh, hey.
What's up, bro?

13:49.629 --> 13:50.931
Your advice totally worked!

13:50.998 --> 13:52.465
Jamie's coming over
after school to study!

13:52.532 --> 13:56.036
Oh. She's already
coming over to study, huh?

13:56.103 --> 13:57.404
That worked
better than I thought.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.139
I'm sorry
I said you're just a mom.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.108
You made this happen. You.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.144
(LAUGHS) And I feel
big feelings about it.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.778
I gotta go buy
some Drakkar

14:05.845 --> 14:07.414
so I smell awesome
when we study.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.481
(CHUCKLES) Bye.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.917
Drakkar?

14:09.983 --> 14:12.652
That is the musk
of Europeans on holiday!

14:12.719 --> 14:13.887
What have I done?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.255
The worst thing
any mom could do.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.157
You became your son's bro.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.026
ADULT ADAM: While my mom
was realizing her mistake,

14:19.092 --> 14:21.561
my dad was gonna try
to win back
the Formica King's jester.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.464
(BELLS JINGLING)
Hey, uh, Marvin.
You got a sec?

14:24.531 --> 14:26.033
Uh, not for you.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.035
I'm in the middle
of a top-secret project

14:28.101 --> 14:29.202
for Formica Mike.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.905
J... Just stop
jingling and...

14:31.972 --> 14:33.673
You can come back
to my store.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.776
I knew it!
Sales have plunged
since your top salesman left.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.511
Sure. If that's what
you want to hear.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.213
Oh, I want a lot more
than that.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.982
I shall return
to your employ

14:42.049 --> 14:43.683
should you meet
the following demands.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.918
Demand number one.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.954
I want stock options.
All of them.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.821
We're not
a public company, moron.

100 paid vacation days.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.093
That's three months!

No.

Toilet...
No.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.997
Office...
No.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.165
And I'm going to change
the name of the store

14:58.231 --> 15:00.700
to Marvin and Brother
Furniture Place.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.769

15:02.835 --> 15:04.104
Hold on. Fine.

15:04.171 --> 15:07.774
All you have to say
is that you need me.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.209
(SCOFFS) I'm not
gonna do that.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.411
Just say it,
and all your dreams
will come true.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.180
I'm not gonna say it.
Just say the words!

15:13.246 --> 15:16.383
I don't need you,
and I never will!

15:16.449 --> 15:17.951
(SCOFFS)

15:19.486 --> 15:20.520
Fine.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.522
We're finished here.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

15:22.589 --> 15:23.690
Leave your basement!

15:25.525 --> 15:27.060

15:27.127 --> 15:28.395
I will leave.

Jamie Weisman

15:34.934 --> 15:36.103
Barry's baby book.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.437
And now here's Barry
with his head

15:37.504 --> 15:39.239
stuck in the banister.
Ooh.

his head stuck in the fence.

so I could get snacks!

15:46.779 --> 15:48.248
How did this happen so fast?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.917
Relax. I'm just showing
your new friend some photos.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.185
Bro. A word?

15:52.252 --> 15:54.321
Sure thing, bro.
Feel free to peruse.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.588
There's some great pictures

15:55.655 --> 15:57.457
of little Barry
making on the potty.

Enjoy.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.595
What did you do?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.731
I just showed her
a photo album.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.898
Like a mom.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.100
What happened
to being my bro?

16:07.167 --> 16:08.835
I am your bro.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.138
But not when it
comes to cool girls
with bad intentions.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.540
I was right!
All you'll ever be is a mom.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.176
Dammit, I want
to be more! I do!

16:16.243 --> 16:18.011

stop myself.

Well, I can.

I ask for your help.

Everything cool?
BARRY: Yeah.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.287
I'll see you tomorrow.

to tell Marvin he needed him,

16:38.731 --> 16:42.001
my dad got a surprise visit
from a guy who did.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.303
Oh, God.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.437
I came to say "Bravo."

perfectly.

What... What...
What are you talking about?

16:47.374 --> 16:48.941
Sabotage.
What?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.710
Sabotage!
What about it?

16:50.777 --> 16:52.779
(WHISPERING) Sabotage.
Stop saying "Sabotage"!

16:52.845 --> 16:55.182
You let me steal your brother
knowing full well

16:55.248 --> 16:57.684
that he would destroy
my store from the inside.

16:57.750 --> 16:58.951
Ohh. What'd he do?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.388
First, he mistook
the display toilet

17:01.454 --> 17:03.623
for "the real deal."
Oh, geez.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.193
Then he wants to rearrange
the stock room.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.960
He loses control
of the forklift.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.629
He pops three water beds.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.898
Now I gotta shut down
because he flooded
my showroom.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.201
Formica Mike, listen to me.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.503
This isn't sabotage.
That wasn't sabotage?

17:16.569 --> 17:19.072
No. I'm not smart enough,
and I know Marvin isn't.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.674
Okay. Then, first,
I'm gonna fire the putz.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.077
Then I'm gonna make him pay
for the water beds.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.079
Don't do that.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.880
I'll pay for it. (SIGHS)

17:27.947 --> 17:29.282
Why would you do that?

He really does mean well.

You do know
that that is the worst thing

17:34.554 --> 17:35.988
that you could say
about a person?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.657
Oh, I'm aware.

Here ya go, Ad.

Sorry I stole your camera.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.930
I guess that's the end
of my illustrious film career.

and a case.

Marvin? Can we, uh,
talk? Again?

it's a good idea

17:52.372 --> 17:53.840
for me to fraternize
with the enemy.

Just shut up and listen.

on Monday at twice the pay.

He tell you
about the forklift incident?
Yes.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.783
And the miscommunication
with the toilet?
Yeah.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.952
He's gonna fire me, isn't he?
Do you want to come back
or don't you?

18:06.018 --> 18:08.921
I don't get it. Why would you
take me back with a raise

18:08.988 --> 18:11.291
when I'm just your dumb
kid brother who "means well"?

18:11.358 --> 18:12.992
Well, this time
you didn't mean well.

with Jamie.

based on some bleachers.

Whatever. It's my fault
for letting you in.
