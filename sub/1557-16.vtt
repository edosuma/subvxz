00:33.133 --> 00:35.067
What's the best
first-person shooter

00:35.069 --> 00:37.236
About genetically modified
space marines?

00:37.238 --> 00:38.704
Halo!

00:38.706 --> 00:41.306
Honey, have you been
playing your new little
video game all day?

00:41.308 --> 00:43.375
When you say it in that tone,
it implies that Luke and I

00:43.377 --> 00:44.977
Haven't been spending
quality time together.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.578
Which we have.
Can I talk to him?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.480
Sure thing. Luke!

00:48.482 --> 00:51.750
I don't think he's here.
I mean, I-I <i> know</i> he's not here.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.585
Where is he?

00:53.587 --> 00:56.989
I am certain he is probably out
with his usual crew of cut-ups.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.757
You're not doing laundry,
are you?

00:58.759 --> 01:01.193
God, no. But I'm about to
if I'm supposed to.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.594
No, no.
Don't. Don't.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.863
But can you vacuum out the
dryer vent before I get home?

01:04.864 --> 01:07.232
I will absolutely do that.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.534
Thanks.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.104
I can't get in touch
with Haley.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.339
I haven't talked to her
since we got in that fight.

01:14.341 --> 01:15.407
She around?

01:15.409 --> 01:16.775
I think she slept
at a friend's house.

01:16.777 --> 01:17.843
What friend?

01:17.845 --> 01:20.012
Um... Not a normal name,

01:20.014 --> 01:22.347
Starts with a vowel,
possibly foreign.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.917
Oh, maybe Alex knows.
Is she home?

01:24.919 --> 01:27.419
Nope.
I have not seen her for hours.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.354
Does Haley know an arjibarge?

01:29.356 --> 01:31.890
Hi, mom.
Hi, honey.
Where are you?

01:31.892 --> 01:33.358
I'm in the kitchen.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.294
Alex?
When'd you get home?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.196
I've been here all day.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.064
Oh. You should get outside,
get some fresh air.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.365
It's a beautiful morning.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.367
It's noon,
and it's freezing out.

01:42.369 --> 01:44.203
Phil, honey,
when I'm not home,

01:44.205 --> 01:46.905
I need you to be present
and keep track of everyone.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.407
Sounds good.
Love you, too.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.542
Alex, do you know
where Haley is?

01:50.544 --> 01:51.743
Mm...

01:51.745 --> 01:53.312
I mean, I know she was
babysitting Lily last night,

01:53.314 --> 01:54.880
But I haven't seen her
since.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.216
By the way, don't read the draft
I sent you last night

01:57.218 --> 01:59.151
Of my college essay.
I just sent you a new version.

01:59.153 --> 02:02.154
Uh, okay. I will go read
that one right now.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.980
Oh, my god. What are you doing?
Are you filming me?

02:27.982 --> 02:30.315
Yes! I want you to see
how crazy you are acting.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.118
Me?! I come to talk to you
about something important,

02:33.120 --> 02:35.587
And then you start chasing me
around with a Camera!

02:35.589 --> 02:37.689
I asked you to clean up
the kitchen nine hours ago

02:37.691 --> 02:38.757
When I left for work.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.792
I come back,
and it's the exact same mess,

02:40.794 --> 02:42.361
Plus pickles
and peanut butter!

02:42.363 --> 02:45.330
I was running around doing stuff
for my crazy boss all day,

02:45.332 --> 02:46.865
And then I got hungry,

02:46.867 --> 02:49.668
And then the smell from the
garbage almost made me throw up!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.103
That's exactly how I feel!

02:51.105 --> 02:52.838
Leave me alone!
I have a lot on my plate!

02:52.840 --> 02:55.107
Yes. Yes, I can see that, honey.
You left it in the sink!

02:55.109 --> 02:56.508
Oh, my god!

02:56.510 --> 02:59.945
I waited in line for two hours,
but I got it.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.947
Ooh, we making a home movie?

03:01.949 --> 03:04.783
...Captions by <b> <i>vitac</i> </b>...

03:04.785 --> 03:07.786
Captioning provided by
20th century fox television
and abc, inc.

03:07.788 --> 03:11.290
And brought to you by ford.
Beautiful things happen
when you go further.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.738
Hello?

03:26.740 --> 03:29.408
Hey, dad. Dad, take the phone
away from your ear.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.743
Why would I do this?
Now I can't hear you.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.079
Put it
in front of your face.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.481
Oh!
How'd you get in my phone?

03:36.483 --> 03:38.517
Does this mean
when we talked the other day

03:38.519 --> 03:40.552
That you knew
I was in the can?
I do now.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.055
How was the presentation?
Actually went really well.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.423
The client loves
the whole re-design.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.258
They just want us
to swap out the handles...

03:46.260 --> 03:47.759
Damn it!
I know.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.194
Only knobs want knobs.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.730
No, Joe bit me.
He's teething.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.766
I don't think it's a coincidence
that andy took the weekend off.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.835
Ow!
Kid's like a beaver.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.570
I'm afraid
to wear short pants.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.706
Hola, Claire.
Hey, Gloria.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.442
How's your trip?
Are you having any fun?

04:03.444 --> 04:07.346
Uh... Yeah. You know,
it's a little windy, but, eh.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.448
So, you're okay with me
cutting Luke's hair, right?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.949
Hey, mom.
Well, hello.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.352
It's nice to know you're not
dead in an alley somewhere.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.720
Right back at you.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.588
Yes, I am fine with you
cutting his hair.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.423
Just don't leave it too long
on the sides.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.459
I am very good
cutting boys' hair.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.894
You should let me
cut yours someday.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.430
Okay, bye-bye, Gloria.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.266
You still there?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.903
Crap. Dad, did you know it was
Mitchell's birthday today?

04:31.905 --> 04:33.372
Of course.
I already called him

04:33.374 --> 04:35.140
Because
I'm a considerate person

04:35.142 --> 04:36.742
Who really cares
about his family.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.910
I reminded him
and dialed the phone.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.579
Mm.
Fly safe.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.749
And remember you can recline.
It's still america up there.

04:43.751 --> 04:44.916
Thanks, dad.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.459
Happy birthday!

04:54.461 --> 04:56.962
Oh, hey.
Is it still my birthday?

04:56.964 --> 04:59.231
Watch it,
or I'll sing to you.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.300
¶ Ha... ¶
okay, okay, I give.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.802
Okay.
So, have you had a good day?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.170
Yes, thank you.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.739
Uh, Lily, she made me her famous
chocolate-chip scrambled eggs...

05:07.741 --> 05:09.808
Ooh.
...Which she then
watched me eat.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.243
Ooh.
Yeah.

05:11.245 --> 05:12.911
You got my present,
didn't you?
No.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.280
Darn it. They promised
it would be there on time.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.015
Oh, well,
I can't wait to open it

05:17.017 --> 05:18.583
And check the date
on the invoice.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.152
Hey, is that Claire?
Yeah.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.586
Hi, Claire!
Hi.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.689
Hi. Hey, uh, did you, uh,
show her my gift yet?

05:23.691 --> 05:24.823
No.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.758
Come on,
show her, show her.
Okay. Yeah.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.327
It's good.

05:30.096 --> 05:33.198
Wow,
shalom and <i> chh-appy</i> birthday.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.266
I know, right?

05:34.268 --> 05:35.767
Isn't it fantastic?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.636
Hey, Claire, did you get me
some garrett's cheese

05:37.638 --> 05:39.638
And caramel corn yet?
Oh, shoot, I forgot.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.174
It's the one thing
you had to do in chicago!

05:42.176 --> 05:43.608
You are so right.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.944
I'm sorry that I let myself
get distracted by my job.

05:45.946 --> 05:49.715
Okay, I'm looking for sweet
and salty, Claire, not bitter.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.884
Relax, Cam.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.820
I'm sure there's a kiosk
around here that sells it.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.121
Good.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.723
Guys, listen, yesterday,
did Haley mention

05:57.725 --> 05:59.658
Where she was gonna go
after she babysat for Lily?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.660
No, but when you do talk to her,
can you tell her

06:01.662 --> 06:03.395
To please be careful
with my powder-blue suit

06:03.397 --> 06:05.197
That Cam let her borrow
without asking me?

06:05.199 --> 06:06.531
Why did she want a suit?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.734
A friend of hers needs it
for a wedding,

06:08.736 --> 06:11.036
And Mitchell needs to stop
dressing like he's in
a barbershop quartet.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.571
Oh.
Lily, honey,

06:12.573 --> 06:14.139
Did Haley say where she was
going when she left here?

06:14.141 --> 06:15.707
Who wants to know?
Aunt Claire.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.243
Hey, aunt Claire. I heard
you were being mean to Haley.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.578
I was not mean to Haley.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.012
Okay, you're screaming.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.215
I don't know where she went.
Maybe dylan knows.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.649
Dylan?
Why would dylan know?

06:24.651 --> 06:26.585
He Came over, and they were
talking on the couch

06:26.587 --> 06:28.987
While I was
in the other room...

06:28.989 --> 06:30.589
Behaving.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.492
She's still talking to dylan?
Really?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.394
Oh, wait, guys,
I got to go.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.229
Uh, happy birthday,
babs.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.231
What does she mean
by that?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.234
Hi, honey.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.735
Oh, don't read
that last draft.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.837
I just changed something
in paragraph three.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.938
Oh, oh, that's too bad.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.774
Paragraph three had
some of my favorite...

06:48.776 --> 06:49.908
Oh, please, I can see your eyes
darting around the screen.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.243
Just read the new one.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.578
Can you just do me a favor
and call your sister?

06:53.580 --> 06:56.281
If she's screening,
I'm not making the cut.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.250
Why don't you just snoop
on her facebook page

06:58.252 --> 06:59.851
With your fake profile?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.088
I don't have
a fake profile.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.590
Mom, save it.
Brody kendall just logged in.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.426
That trick might've worked
on Haley,

07:07.428 --> 07:09.428
But I know that's a picture
of chachi.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.929
Oh, my god.
What?

07:10.931 --> 07:13.532
Please tell me
that's some kind of mistake!

07:13.534 --> 07:15.133
Where?
Which paragraph?

07:15.135 --> 07:16.701
Get your father... now!

07:16.703 --> 07:18.136
Dad, mom needs you!

07:18.138 --> 07:19.404
Tell her
I'm in the shower!

07:24.811 --> 07:26.411
Honey, who do we call?
What do we do?

07:26.413 --> 07:28.079
There's no way
Haley's married.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.115
Then why did she
change her facebook status?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.750
She probably didn't.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.885
It could be a computer glitch,
someone hacked her account.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.588
I just think we should stay calm
until we know the story.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.925
Honey, I cannot get on a plane
for four hours

07:39.927 --> 07:42.661
And be out of touch
and not know what happened!

07:42.663 --> 07:44.162
It's not just
the facebook thing.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.765
She borrowed a blue suit
from Mitchell for a wedding.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.334
Something borrowed,
something blue?
Do you get it?

07:49.336 --> 07:50.936
Who would she even marry?

07:50.938 --> 07:52.904
I don't know, but she was
with dylan yesterday,

07:52.906 --> 07:54.606
And if she was gonna
marry him,

07:54.608 --> 07:56.575
She would definitely hide that
from us.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.110
But that makes no sense.
Why wouldn't he call me?

08:00.681 --> 08:02.948
Oh, hey, mrs. "D."
hey, dylan!

08:02.950 --> 08:04.082
Oh, hi, mr. "d"!

08:04.084 --> 08:06.251
Are you with Haley?
In what way?

08:06.253 --> 08:08.920
Physically, romantically,
maritally?

08:08.922 --> 08:11.089
No. I'm at work.
I have a career now.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.491
Oh.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.193
Hey, uh, can you hold this phone
for a second?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.600
So, you have no idea
where Haley is right now?

08:21.602 --> 08:24.536
You mean spiritually,
geographically?

08:24.538 --> 08:26.438
Can you please stop
spinning that sign?

08:26.440 --> 08:28.006
No.
My boss says if I do,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.775
He'll replace me
with one of those guys!

08:30.777 --> 08:33.278
Go back
to where you Came from!

08:33.280 --> 08:34.813
Dylan, focus!

08:34.815 --> 08:38.183
I don't know where she is,
but I can sense that she's okay.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.184
It's like
we share the same brain.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.385
Who has it now?

08:41.388 --> 08:43.054
Okay, so, last night
when you were with her,

08:43.056 --> 08:45.557
She didn't say anything
about getting married?

08:45.559 --> 08:48.560
Haley got married?!
That's so upsetting!

08:48.562 --> 08:50.061
Done.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.970
Hi, mom.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.705
Do you have Haley's
icloud password?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.707
Yeah, she gave it to me
in a little envelope

09:02.709 --> 09:04.910
With her diary key and a list
of things she's most afraid of.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.845
Maybe we could guess it.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.914
Claire,
you accidentally hung up on me.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.650
Oh, yeah, well, honey,
you know me and computers.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.718
Mom's trying to guess
Haley's icloud password,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.321
Which, personally, I think
is an invasion of her privacy.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.256
Ooh, try "password."

09:20.060 --> 09:21.660
I'm kind of glad
that didn't work.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.428
Wait, I think I remember
telling her to use something

09:23.430 --> 09:24.996
That people wouldn't know
about her,

09:24.998 --> 09:27.232
Like her favorite
literary character.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.567
I'm in!

09:28.569 --> 09:30.068
What? What was it?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.369
Snoopy.
Wow.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.371
And that could be
your new nickname.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.408
Okay.
"find my iphone."

09:36.410 --> 09:38.677
Oh, no!
She's in vegas.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.078
Are you serious?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.213
Oh, hang on. I'm zooming in.
Hold on, hold on.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.783
Let me see what I can,
uh...

09:44.785 --> 09:46.952
Come on.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.254
And... oh, god!

09:49.256 --> 09:50.889
Honey, she's at
a wedding chapel!

09:50.891 --> 09:53.024
Okay, that's troubling,
but think about it.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.627
If she's not with dylan,
who would she be marrying?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.862
I don't know! Alex, she had to
have told you something!

09:57.864 --> 10:00.098
Okay, you are really rubbing in
our lack of closeness.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.267
She won't even tell me
what conditioner she uses.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.302
I have 12 minutes!
Think!

10:04.304 --> 10:06.037
Uh... I don't know.
Ask uncle Mitchell.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.872
They're always giggling
about boys.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.274
Oh! Oh, good!
Okay, yes, I'm gonna do that.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.775
I'm calling him.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.211
If it helps, I can alert my
magician contacts in vegas.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.647
Although, they are better
at making girls disappear

10:15.649 --> 10:17.582
than they are finding them.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.652
What?

10:20.654 --> 10:22.621
Lily, honey,
I need you get Mitchell.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.290
But they said I could have
20 minutes of ipad time.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.825
Mitchell? Mitchell?!

10:26.827 --> 10:28.827
Hey, what's up?

10:28.829 --> 10:31.129
Uh, I-I really need to
talk to Mitchell.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.597
It's my ipad time!

10:32.599 --> 10:34.833
Honey, what did I tell you
about being selfish?

10:34.835 --> 10:36.935
Aunt Claire needs to
speak to other daddy

10:36.937 --> 10:39.004
Just as soon
as she gets me my popcorn.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.073
What? You... Cam, I promise you,
I will get you your popcorn,

10:42.075 --> 10:44.309
But right now,
I need to talk to Mitchell!

10:44.311 --> 10:45.276
Okay, cheese and caramel.
Fine.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.177
And carmel.
Fine.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.812
Hey, what's up?

10:47.814 --> 10:50.515
So, I'm pretty sure that Haley
is getting married in vegas.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.916
What?!
What?!

10:51.918 --> 10:53.518
Yeah, I need to know
who she's been dating.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.520
Um, t-there was this one guy
who she thought

10:55.522 --> 10:57.522
That she might like,
but, uh, I don't know.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.124
She was weirdly secretive
about him,

10:59.126 --> 11:01.326
But I-I g... I guess
that could still be thing.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.762
Oh, hang on, hang on...
Getting a call from dad.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.264
Do the thing.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.033
Do the cute thing.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.467
Dad?
Claire?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.036
Dad?
Mitchell?

11:11.038 --> 11:13.104
What are you doing
in my phone?
You called me, dad.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.440
No, I didn't.
I'm shooting a video with Joe.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.609
Am I in your kitchen
with you?
No.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.444
Then you're not shooting a video
with Joe.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.380
Hi, Jay! Claire, was just
about to go run an errand!

11:22.382 --> 11:23.948
Are you kidding me?!

11:23.950 --> 11:25.784
Okay, for god sakes.
Hold...

11:25.786 --> 11:27.619
Would you mind watching my
computer for me for a minute?

11:27.621 --> 11:29.688
- Thank you so much.
- Of course, dear.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.357
Hey, mitch,
I'm liking the new hat.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.526
It gives you some presence.
What you getting at, dad?

11:34.528 --> 11:36.061
Nothing.
It's a strong look.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.630
Y-you like one of those tough
guys in an old western movie.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.131
Really?
Yeah.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.966
Oh, I guess it is
kind of badass.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.735
What if I tilt it
a little bit?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.036
You ruined it.
Oh.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.905
I like your hat.
It suits you.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.240
Oh, thank you, ma'am.
Well, you're welcome.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.742
Okay, thank you.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.311
All right, got your
life-changing popcorn.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.813
Yes!

11:54.815 --> 11:57.415
Now, can we get back to figuring
out who Haley married?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.385
Haley got married?!
Oh, my gosh,
I hope it was not to jackson.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.653
Jackson!

12:01.655 --> 12:04.089
He was into some weird,
um, food.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.423
Oh, god!

12:05.425 --> 12:07.192
Whoa, Haley got married?!
She is in so much trouble!

12:07.194 --> 12:09.561
Luke, what have you done
to your hair?!

12:09.563 --> 12:10.895
Claire,
when you react like this,

12:10.897 --> 12:12.697
You're just giving him
what he wants.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.866
Luke said
that you knew about it!

12:14.868 --> 12:16.768
I didn't know about it!

12:16.770 --> 12:19.204
I said
<i>a</i> parent knew about it.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.205
Phil!

12:22.943 --> 12:24.242
I know we're not there yet,

12:24.244 --> 12:26.211
But I've been researching
annulments.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.547
Oh, we are there because
you let our child get a mohawk!

12:29.549 --> 12:31.282
Sweet!

12:31.284 --> 12:33.051
We... Had a bet.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.886
You let him get a mohawk
because he won a bet?!

12:34.888 --> 12:36.187
No, he lost the bet.
What?! Phil!

12:36.189 --> 12:38.022
Well, I-I...
Would you rather I had a mohawk?

12:38.024 --> 12:39.891
I have a career.
I-I don't have time
for this.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.127
We've got to get back
to figuring out

12:42.129 --> 12:43.461
Who Haley has married
in vegas.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.863
Hold on.
Someone's at the door.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.431
Okay.
So, Haley's in vegas?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.199
Yes.
If you want,
I can call andy.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.068
He's there, too.
Maybe he can find her.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.569
Andy's in vegas?

12:51.571 --> 12:54.105
Yeah, he borrowed some cuff
links from me for some wedding.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.075
Oh, my god, you guys
don't think that Haley
married andy, do you?

12:57.077 --> 12:59.244
- Haley married andy! Yeah.
- What?!

12:59.246 --> 13:01.446
What bet did he lose?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.149
Andy is dating some girl in
utah, and Haley knows that.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.084
Even if Haley
was attracted to him,

13:06.086 --> 13:08.820
I would hope she would have the
decency and the self-control...

13:08.822 --> 13:10.922
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, she married andy!

13:10.924 --> 13:12.257
I knew
she was still into him.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.925
She said he wasn't her type,
but I'm like,

13:13.927 --> 13:16.494
"he's a man.
He's breathing."

13:16.496 --> 13:19.264
Maybe this is why she doesn't
talk to me about things.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.667
No, it can't be him.
He's a very nice boy.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.068
Claire, trust me,

13:24.070 --> 13:26.638
Andy's not gonna run off
and elope with Haley.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.139
He's a stand-up guy.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.008
- It's a package for Haley.
- Open it.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.177
Well, that seems like
an invasion of her priv...

13:32.179 --> 13:33.378
Open it!

13:37.183 --> 13:39.517
"What to expect
when you're expecting."

13:39.519 --> 13:40.785
oh, my god!

13:40.787 --> 13:43.254
I told you
he was a stand-up guy.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.264
She's not answering, Phil.
Are you calling andy?

13:53.266 --> 13:54.933
It's going straight
to voice mail.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.936
I can't believe
she's pregnant.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.804
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.439
Jump? Let's review.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.108
She's been moody, eating weird
food, getting nauseous.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.977
She left
in the middle of the night

14:05.979 --> 14:08.379
For a wedding chapel in vegas
with her secret love,

14:08.381 --> 14:11.649
And most suspicious of all,
she bought a book!

14:11.651 --> 14:13.685
Oh, no.
What if you're right?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.720
What will we do?
I don't know.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.055
I'll kill that andy.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.390
How could he be
so irresponsible?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.825
I mean, he's a good kid.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.794
But to run off
with my baby girl

14:22.796 --> 14:25.029
After I fell for his
"aw, shucks" act!

14:25.031 --> 14:27.332
Which is probably not an act
because he's genuinely nice

14:27.334 --> 14:29.133
And he thinks "shucks"
is the "s" word.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.668
Still,
I want to kill him!

14:30.670 --> 14:32.136
But that would be
robbing my grandchild

14:32.138 --> 14:33.705
Of probably
a really great father!

14:33.707 --> 14:35.073
Damn you, andy bailey!

14:35.075 --> 14:36.908
His last name is bailey?

14:36.910 --> 14:40.311
Oh, my god,
she's gonna be Haley bailey.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.082
Wait.
I just thought of something.
What?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.184
I'm going to be the first woman
in my family

14:46.186 --> 14:48.253
Not to get pregnant
and drop out of college.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.088
Ooh, maybe <i> that</i>
should be my essay.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.422
I graduated from college.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.324
Yeah, and Haley got kicked out
of college

14:53.326 --> 14:54.525
Before she got pregnant.

14:54.527 --> 14:58.062
Okay, hang on, honey.
I am sending you a picture.

14:58.064 --> 15:02.233
Do you think that this arsonist
looks like andy with a beard?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.736
No.
He's not an arsonist.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.938
Gloria hired him
to take care of her baby.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.339
Gloria.
Right, of course.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.074
You know how protective
she is.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.443
I'm sure she had him
thoroughly vetted.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.845
Hola!

15:13.847 --> 15:15.747
Gloria,
where did you find andy?

15:15.749 --> 15:17.782
At the park,
chasing some children.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.884
Oh, my god.
I'm gonna call him again.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.119
Hey, mom, check it out.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.187
God, Luke,
what have you done?!

15:23.189 --> 15:25.757
I know. What does he have
to rebel against?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.792
Haley pregnant
and me in a mohawk...

15:27.794 --> 15:30.128
This year's christmas card
is gonna rule.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.196
What's going on?
Did you find her?

15:32.198 --> 15:34.565
No, dad, no, I haven't
found her. And you know what?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.134
This is all your fault

15:36.136 --> 15:39.203
Because you two introduced this
horny stranger into our lives.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.538
Let me get this straight.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.740
You're mad because your daughter
got knocked up

15:42.742 --> 15:45.977
And ran off with some goofy guy
to get married behind your back.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.246
I can't even imagine
what that must feel like.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.247
Really? Now?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.049
I can't think
of a better time.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.217
Jay, stop kicking her
while she's down,

15:53.219 --> 15:56.421
Pointing out her mistakes at
the same time the whole universe

15:56.423 --> 15:59.057
Is telling her
that she's a terrible mother!

15:59.059 --> 16:02.260
Oh, my god, okay, can't do this.
Got to go. Bye.

16:15.074 --> 16:19.077
¶ Christopher robin and I
walked along ¶

16:19.079 --> 16:24.582
¶ under branches
lit up by the moon ¶

16:24.584 --> 16:28.286
¶ posing our questions

16:28.288 --> 16:31.856
¶ as our days disappeared
all too s... ¶

16:35.929 --> 16:37.662
I miss my little girl!

16:37.664 --> 16:39.530
Claire, don't do that.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.800
Yes, Claire,
don't do that!

16:42.802 --> 16:44.435
Look...

16:44.437 --> 16:46.337
You're not gonna find her
at the bottom of that tin.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.172
You're not near the bottom
of that tin, are you?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.008
I'm gonna be a grandmother!

16:50.010 --> 16:51.776
Aww, there, there, dear.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.044
Okay, Claire...

16:53.046 --> 16:55.279
We don't know anything
for sure yet.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.815
So take a deep breath...

16:57.817 --> 17:00.051
...Put the popcorn down...

17:00.053 --> 17:02.253
And just get your...

17:04.356 --> 17:05.857
Not cool, grandma!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.326
Okay, Claire,
listen, listen.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.694
Sometimes life hands you things
that you don't want

17:10.696 --> 17:13.364
And... and they turn out to be
exactly what you need.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.233
And, oh, my god, I think
I just talked myself
into liking this hat

17:16.236 --> 17:18.202
Because I keep seeing myself
in it,

17:18.204 --> 17:20.738
And I'm like,
"who is that handsome yentl man?"

17:20.740 --> 17:22.073
Are you serious right now?

17:22.075 --> 17:23.907
Well...

17:23.910 --> 17:25.175
Oh, god, I got to go.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.254
I'm sorry. I wasn't
that helpful. Are you okay?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.890
Our little baby got married
without us.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.525
I was supposed to
give her away.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.894
I was supposed to walk her
down the aisle

17:42.896 --> 17:45.029
And give her husband-to-be
one of these.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.498
"That's my baby girl.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.233
You take care of her."

17:49.235 --> 17:50.568
Yeah.
'cause that's what
dads do.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.070
I got to call my dad.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.272
Please don't tell him
I was in charge when she left.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.577
Hello.
Can you see me?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.446
Thumb, dad.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.548
The minute they got rid
of rotary phones,

18:03.550 --> 18:04.749
Everything went to hell.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.851
Dad, I'm really sorry
that I eloped.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.519
You were a great dad,

18:08.521 --> 18:11.456
And you should've been there
to walk me down the aisle,

18:11.458 --> 18:14.759
And... and I've never apologized
for taking that away from you.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.129
Well, we got to do that thing
in hawaii, and that was nice.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.731
Yeah. Guess what goes around
comes around, huh?

18:20.733 --> 18:23.568
Look... You're in the eye
of the tornado right now,

18:23.570 --> 18:27.071
And you can't see anything but
your life swirling around you.

18:27.073 --> 18:30.708
But andy's a good guy,
just like Phil,

18:30.710 --> 18:34.212
And years from now,
you might look back on this

18:34.214 --> 18:37.148
And think, "the best thing
that could've happened..."

18:37.150 --> 18:39.750
Was that dipstick
knocking up my daughter."

18:40.920 --> 18:42.420
Aww!
That's so sweet.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.455
Was he listening?!
Yeah.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.923
This dipstick loves you,
too, Jay!

18:45.925 --> 18:47.758
I take it all back!

18:47.760 --> 18:49.760
Jay!
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.095
I am trying to fix it!

18:51.097 --> 18:53.431
Gloria's talking to me.
Some of it's in english.

18:53.433 --> 18:57.301
Claire, Claire!
Look, look, I fix Luke's hair!

18:57.303 --> 18:59.437
Oh, my god,
he looks like shemp!

18:59.439 --> 19:01.439
Okay, yes, it's true,
but...

19:01.441 --> 19:03.841
But maybe if I cut a little bit
more on the sides or in...

19:03.843 --> 19:05.243
Oh, no, no, no.
No more cutting.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.078
Just give me a chance
to get used to it.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.014
Oh, it's Haley!
Haley's calling!

19:10.016 --> 19:11.582
What?!

19:11.584 --> 19:12.817
Hi, mom.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.185
"Hi, mom"?!

19:14.187 --> 19:16.154
We have been trying to get
in touch with you all day!

19:16.156 --> 19:18.156
I've been in bed.
Oh, goodness.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.757
I don't think we need to
hear the details.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.126
Haley...
We know everything.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.162
And I understand
why you hid it from us,

19:24.164 --> 19:26.764
And while we are not happy,
young lady,

19:26.766 --> 19:28.499
We're gonna work this out.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.269
Uh, before I admit
to anything,

19:31.271 --> 19:34.405
Maybe you could be
more specific?

19:35.941 --> 19:37.608
Haley! You're home!

19:37.610 --> 19:39.610
Yeah, I've been home all day.
I've been sleeping.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.546
So,
you didn't get married?!

19:41.548 --> 19:43.481
Married?!
Why would I get married?!

19:43.483 --> 19:45.383
Because you're pregnant
with andy's baby!

19:45.385 --> 19:47.451
What?!
Why would you think that?!

19:47.453 --> 19:48.619
Oh.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.988
Because you changed your
facebook status to "married"

19:50.990 --> 19:52.323
And then
we tracked your cellphone

19:52.325 --> 19:54.125
To a wedding chapel
in vegas.

19:54.127 --> 19:55.493
And you ordered this book!

19:55.495 --> 19:57.628
Wow, first of all,
it's called privacy.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.864
Google it.
Second, I married a cronut.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.199
What?

20:01.201 --> 20:03.401
Last night,
my <i> friend</i> andy and I,

20:03.403 --> 20:05.203
We went to go get cronuts,

20:05.205 --> 20:07.004
And I said
that they were so amazing,

20:07.006 --> 20:10.174
I wanted to marry one, so I
posted it on facebook as a joke.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.577
Then I accidentally
left my phone in andy's car,

20:12.579 --> 20:15.046
Which he drove
to a friend's wedding in vegas,

20:15.048 --> 20:16.981
And that book
is for my crazy boss

20:16.983 --> 20:18.849
Because he's designing
maternity clothes

20:18.851 --> 20:21.586
And he wants to get inside
the mind of preggos!

20:21.588 --> 20:22.486
Thank god!

20:22.488 --> 20:24.889
I'm so relieved!

20:24.891 --> 20:28.926
Wait a second. How did you
get onto my facebook page?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.228
I unfriended you.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.896
She's brody kendall.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.364
Oh, my god, gross!

20:33.366 --> 20:35.499
I've been playing candy crush
with my mother!

20:35.501 --> 20:37.368
How did you track my phone?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.403
Well, I don't think
that really matters,

20:39.405 --> 20:41.172
And there's
a perfectly reasona...

20:44.210 --> 20:48.679
Oh, cut it out. I can see people
walking behind you.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.249
Okay, got to go.
