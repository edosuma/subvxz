00:20.771 --> 00:22.689
You put on any perfume today?

00:23.398 --> 00:24.942
Wear your hair different?
Anything like that?

00:25.025 --> 00:27.653
-His face was narrower.
-We'll get there. We'll get there.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.448
You were on your way home.
You go your usual route?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.700
Look. His chin is like this.

00:33.784 --> 00:36.745
-See?
-I understand wanting to rush this along.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.665
I wanna make sure we sketch out
the right man.

00:41.959 --> 00:42.960
Look.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.380
-His eyes were this far apart.
-You know what?

00:46.463 --> 00:48.173
-Let's look at the catalog.
-They were deep set.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.883
-Okay--
-How about you listen to me

00:49.967 --> 00:51.468
and draw what I tell you to?

00:57.266 --> 00:58.475
What color were his eyes?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.811
-Blue.
-You saw the whites on both sides?

01:00.894 --> 01:01.895
Yes.

01:04.605 --> 01:05.649
What about his nose?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.234
The eyes aren't right yet.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.403
-Do they look close enough?
-Yeah, but I can help the--

01:09.486 --> 01:12.739
That's all that we want.
The composite isn't a portrait.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.992
Some stranger won't recognize him
off the street.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.494
-That never happens.
-Then what am I doing here?

01:17.578 --> 01:20.289
We just need enough details
for someone who knows him,

01:20.372 --> 01:22.457
so they can recognize the sketch.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.209
It won't work.

01:25.669 --> 01:26.837
No one knows him.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.316
Hello?

01:51.320 --> 01:52.362
Hello?

01:55.782 --> 01:56.825
Somebody?

02:00.537 --> 02:01.830
Can somebody help me, please?

02:01.914 --> 02:03.540
You going to cut that shit out, man.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.375
Okay, no one's coming.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.923
Can you come over here?
Can you give me a hand, please?

02:12.299 --> 02:13.884
They strapped me down.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.647
You cut your flexor tendon.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.900
Somebody let loose on you, huh?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.445
-How tight are those things?
-Tight enough.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.656
Now, you get 'em off me now.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.783
-There's no name down for you.
-Come on now.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.451
You don't have no ID.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.286
Please, take these off.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.039
They found you unconscious on Racine.

02:44.122 --> 02:48.335
There's cash in the inside pocket.
It's yours. Just come on.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.338
Yeah, somebody already cleaned you out.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.424
Them paramedics, they are sneaky.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.218
Hey, take these fucking things--

02:58.136 --> 03:00.305
Hey, you all right man? What's going on?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.015
How long have I been here for?

03:02.099 --> 03:04.810
You come in last night. They usually
move the long-haulers upstairs.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.062
What time? How long?
How many hours has it been?

03:07.145 --> 03:09.189
It looks like the ambulance
brought you in around midnight.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.109
Oh, shit. I gotta go.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.944
You gotta get me outta here.
I gotta get outta here.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.612
I can't be away from the house this long.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.739
-You got someone waiting for you?
-I need to go home

03:17.823 --> 03:19.491
or I'll end up like fucking Leo.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.285
I need to go home now.
I need to go home now!

03:21.368 --> 03:24.329
Like, the nurses must have had
good reason to strap you down.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.207
If you let me up now, I'm leaving.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.085
But if I have to wait for someone else,

03:31.545 --> 03:33.422
I'll be coming by your bed on the way out.

03:35.591 --> 03:36.884
You take 'em off.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.515
Fine. Do not swing at me.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.769
I dealt with enough bullshit today.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.778
Nope. No.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.919
Can I talk to her? See if she's okay?

06:17.002 --> 06:19.129
She's getting her stuff.
She'll be out here soon.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.549
It's definitely the same guy.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.926
That's what she said.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.555
You think she's lying.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.145
Where is everybody here?
You can't be the only person on this.

06:35.229 --> 06:39.274
We had Kirby in for a composite,
we have patrol officers still at the bar.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.693
I don't know how much more you want me
to do for an assault with no injuries.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.570
It's not one assault.

06:44.196 --> 06:47.157
It's multiple women dead
over multiple decades.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.118
Yeah, and I've got detectives reviewing
their old notes,

06:50.202 --> 06:52.913
looking at all the old cold cases,
and nobody--

06:54.373 --> 06:55.374
What?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.084
What is it?

07:02.548 --> 07:04.091
Is this from last night?

07:05.259 --> 07:06.635
Is this who Kirby saw?

07:07.219 --> 07:08.470
Why? How do you know him?

07:08.554 --> 07:12.808
He was outside of Julia Madrigal's house.
He said he was her neighbor.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.477
-He talked to you?
-At the wake, when it was wrapping up.

07:15.561 --> 07:16.895
He ask about Kirby?

07:17.479 --> 07:19.398
He wanted to know about Julia.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.319
No judgment here, but were you sober?

07:25.779 --> 07:26.780
No.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.492
But I talked to this guy
for a good couple of minutes,

07:30.576 --> 07:32.536
and that's him.

07:35.706 --> 07:39.168
You bring Kirby with you to Julia's house?

07:42.045 --> 07:43.255
Yeah, she was there.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.632
Must be where he's seen her.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.192
Hey. How you feeling?

08:03.275 --> 08:04.735
-Did you drive here?
-Yeah.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.153
We have to go back to the bar.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.363
From last night?
The police were there already.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.618
That's him.

08:12.701 --> 08:16.413
He had a tattoo? Where did you get that?
Lynsky wouldn't release a copy to me.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.831
I took it.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.627
Hey, Kirby. Wait.

08:23.337 --> 08:27.257
Hey, slow down. You have to take the day.
Marcus and your mom are waiting for you.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.009
Your car's in the lot.
We can go through here.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.219
No, wait. Okay.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.722
You have to go there and tell them
that you are okay.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.724
Are you okay?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.520
I'll see Marcus
when we get back to the office.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.525
We don't need to be here.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.319
There has to be someone who saw him.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.571
Police already canvassed for witnesses.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.202
I know how he found you.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.581
I saw him at the Madrigal house.

09:00.499 --> 09:03.126
-He talked to you?
-Yeah. He wanted to know about Julia.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.546
He wanted to know about
what I was going to write.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.423
Listen,
I shouldn't have brought you there.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.676
He must have seen us together.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.387
No, he's been watching me
for a lot longer than that.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.265
Since I was a kid.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.308
Like you guys-- you guys grew up together?

09:18.392 --> 09:19.810
No, he has just always been there.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.186
I remembered him

09:21.270 --> 09:24.982
from when Rachel and I were living
at one of her fucking boyfriend's places.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.942
He came up to me, I was on my own.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.237
And he was the same as last night,

09:30.737 --> 09:32.823
exactly the same.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.199
Okay, listen.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.160
Maybe now is not
when we have to figure this out.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.662
No. It's not just him.

09:40.664 --> 09:41.665
Okay?

09:46.712 --> 09:49.631
Things change for meâ€¦

09:51.508 --> 09:53.468
from one second to the next.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.680
-They're different.
-Please don't do this.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.600
It happened the first time
after my attack.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.645
I'd been out of the hospital
for maybe a year.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.607
I had been back at work that whole time.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.986
So I go into the Tribune,
just like always.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.656
Security says
that I hadn't been there for months.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.452
They hadn't seen me.
No one had talked to me.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.080
There was someone else sitting at my desk.

10:22.748 --> 10:27.586
And then I go home and my mom is there.
She says she's been crashing with me.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.838
I hadn't lived with her since I was a kid.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.841
She had no idea what I was talking about.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.136
No one did.

10:38.222 --> 10:41.391
Things changed for me just like that,

10:41.475 --> 10:43.352
and nobody knows any different.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.898
And then it happens again, and again.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.943
-Have you talked to Marcus about this?
-That's what I'm telling you.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.197
I never married him.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.326
I just came home one day,
and he was there.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.498
I don't know what to say.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.668
All right. Look, I came here last night
and I found these.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.670
You remember these, right?
I told you about them.

11:09.753 --> 11:14.007
How the fuck does he have this matchbook
from this bar, six years ago?

11:15.551 --> 11:17.970
Because this place has probably
been in business for a while.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.681
It was a fucking laundromat last week.
We came here together.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.725
Yes, we came here together,
but it looked just like it does now.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.020
It wasn't any different.

11:31.900 --> 11:32.901
Okay.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.073
Okay.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.276
-Hey, Jinny.
-Hey, Sheila. I need a favor.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.446
When did I report my keys stolen?

12:18.197 --> 12:20.032
Any activity saves to the logs.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.159
You got your new one?

12:25.704 --> 12:27.789
This was activated a week ago.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.584
But the old one's still on here.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.878
Someone's been using it.

12:32.961 --> 12:33.962
Who?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.508
It must be you.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.760
You're coming and going on the same days.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.137
No. The times are off.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.641
My old key was used at 8:25.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.476
I'm always upstairs by 8:00.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.062
Why is someone following me in?

12:50.145 --> 12:53.273
Either way,
it stopped a couple of days ago.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.652
Whoever it was, they must've
figured out their mistake.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.238
Thanks.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.252
This is all from the article?

13:19.508 --> 13:21.051
-Let me find Abby.
-Okay.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.726
I'm gonna have to call you right back.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.478
-Hey.
-Got it. Got it.

13:32.271 --> 13:35.524
-Is this all from this morning?
-Yeah. Abby has us running the phones.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.484
-It's a blitz.
-We just heard what happened.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.945
Are you okay? You don't need to be here.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.989
Where else would I be?
Did Abby set a folo?

13:42.072 --> 13:44.575
-We're about to talk it through.
-Great. See you in there.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.662
Obviously, the story's gaining traction.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.498
The home edition sold out.
Reader engagement is overwhelming.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.542
We've got all the clerks covering leads.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.502
I mean, most are junk,
but there's a few maybes.

13:55.586 --> 13:58.881
Yeah, a serial rapist,
his release dates line up,

13:58.964 --> 14:01.008
and a young woman called about her dad.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.759
His route passes some of the dump sites.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.095
Anything credible we share with CPD?

14:05.179 --> 14:06.889
Dan, how do you wanna handle folo?

14:06.972 --> 14:09.141
I have a Summer Francis profile
ready to go,

14:09.224 --> 14:12.644
but I wanted to call the DA about
their Madrigal suspect cause there's no--

14:12.728 --> 14:15.397
We should cover what happened to me
last night.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.483
You sure?
We can give that a day to breathe.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.027
No, we should run with it.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.905
I have a copy of his police sketch.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.490
No.
They really don't want us to release that.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.826
We can't wait. People need to see that.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.036
Look at the shit show.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.914
If we print this, it's gonna be
a hundred times worse for the police.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.665
They won't have time
to actually look for him.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.667
-What am I supposed--
-Why don't we table this for today?

14:35.751 --> 14:38.337
We need to make space
for the Summer Francis profile.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.880
What's going on with the new commissioner?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.465
The city council hasn't reconvened

14:41.548 --> 14:44.218
-to confirm Wilby's appointment yet.
-Okay. What else could we--

14:44.301 --> 14:46.345
I have a piece
on Calumet docks, union rally.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.347
That's still not gonna
free up enough space.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.394
Hey.

14:55.854 --> 14:56.980
Everything okay?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.692
He's been coming to my work.
I just didn't know.

15:01.318 --> 15:04.238
-Do you recognize him?
-I don't know.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.199
I lead a dozen tours every week.
I see hundreds of faces.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.329
Since your keys went missing,
has anything been different?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.706
Like things are one way for you
and then they change,

15:14.790 --> 15:17.417
and no one notices but you?

15:19.336 --> 15:21.713
I've never had anything like that happen.

15:21.797 --> 15:22.798
Have you?

15:24.007 --> 15:26.343
At the bar last night, he saw it too.

15:28.846 --> 15:31.682
How can we be the only two
people who see something?

15:33.058 --> 15:34.268
I just don't get it.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.106
No one really knows how we're connected.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.608
Take two particles.

15:41.692 --> 15:44.194
They could be connected somehow,

15:44.778 --> 15:47.656
like there's an invisible thread
linking them.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.200
They can't act independently,

15:50.284 --> 15:53.704
so if you affect one,
the other reacts in kind.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.456
Their actions are entangled.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.711
One impacts the other,
even across all of space-time.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.301
You ever see things change here,

16:08.719 --> 16:10.304
like how it did at the house?

16:11.430 --> 16:15.934
When they wheel someone out,
it's the only time anything's different.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.938
No, no. I'm serious, Leo.

16:21.273 --> 16:22.566
What do you want from me?

16:24.818 --> 16:30.949
All I see are these fucking lights,
and they make it hard to remember.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.035
-I should probably come backâ€¦
-Yeah, wellâ€¦

16:33.118 --> 16:34.244
â€¦to the house with you.

16:35.454 --> 16:37.581
â€¦that's not what we talked about,
you know?

16:39.291 --> 16:41.168
Nah. Yeah, can't happen.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.587
Come on. I'll walk with you.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.139
I saw a change outside the house.

16:55.307 --> 16:58.393
Well, sure it's not like the lights?

16:58.477 --> 17:00.854
-Maybe you're starting to slip too.
-Oh, no. No.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.192
-Someone else was there. They saw it too.
-Then why are you asking me?

17:05.275 --> 17:06.944
Because I never brought her
back to the house.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.029
-She couldn't possibly understand--
-Hold on, she?

17:09.112 --> 17:10.739
Where did you meet her?

17:10.821 --> 17:12.031
You knowâ€¦

17:13.992 --> 17:15.452
just out.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.954
Are you sure she saw
the same thing as you?

17:18.664 --> 17:20.165
She saw something change?

17:20.249 --> 17:22.041
Oh, yeah. And you know what?

17:22.125 --> 17:23.836
I could tell
it wasn't her first time either.

17:25.963 --> 17:28.507
Maybe it's her that's making it change,
you know?

17:29.758 --> 17:31.593
Maybe she knows something you don't.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.097
Nah.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.477
Nineteen.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.646
Last one.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.997
Hi, I'm Kirby Mazrachi.
I asked you about the key chain you lost.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.749
Okay. Why are you here?

18:02.833 --> 18:06.336
Your key, it was found
on a woman who was murdered.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.631
The photo I showed you was
from a crime scene.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.049
Come on up.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.364
-Hey. Thank you for letting me up.
-Come in.

18:50.214 --> 18:53.842
He watched me for years. I had no idea.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.303
I'm not you.

18:57.012 --> 19:01.099
Then why was your key
left inside a dead woman?

19:02.809 --> 19:05.395
But you said this photo was
from 20 years ago.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.398
Are you sure they only made these
last year?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.776
Hubble returned
its first picture of Jupiter.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.486
We did a whole exhibit.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.154
What's that?

19:15.280 --> 19:19.368
Probably the rain.
It's supposed to pour all night.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.830
Look, I have to get going.
I'm covering the midnight show.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.494
The latch always sticks.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.207
You don't have blinds. Aren't you
worried about people watching?

20:08.208 --> 20:10.878
Let them. I'd rather have the light.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.522
Where's Dan?

21:11.605 --> 21:13.023
He's in the conference room.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.068
Okay, just let me know--

21:16.151 --> 21:18.862
Can you confirm
what we sent over, Detective?

21:18.946 --> 21:21.657
We tried to review the files
on the woman you sent us.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.992
-Who's that?
-Lynsky.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.119
-You were saying?
-And it seems like

21:26.203 --> 21:28.539
you pulled most of your background
from our property warehouse.

21:28.622 --> 21:30.791
Initially, yes, but we followed up
on everything we found.

21:30.874 --> 21:33.627
Have you reached out to the Madrigals?
Could they identify him?

21:33.710 --> 21:34.878
Is that Kirby?

21:34.962 --> 21:37.130
No, we haven't circulated
the composite yet.

21:37.214 --> 21:40.467
Listen, did either of you interact
with sealed evidence?

21:41.635 --> 21:44.388
Kirby, the seal on your evidence bag
was cut.

21:45.055 --> 21:47.516
Detective, I'm afraid
we'll have to call you back.

21:48.684 --> 21:50.644
Okay. It's not like he says.

21:52.229 --> 21:55.065
Showing up at a property warehouse
is questionable.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.109
Accessing evidence,
that's flat-out illegal.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.695
It's my stuff, Abby.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.448
They're not doing anything with it.
They're not building a case.

22:03.532 --> 22:04.533
It's just dumped there.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.370
Did you take anything out?
Leave anything behind?

22:08.453 --> 22:11.248
No. Absolutely not.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.374
Dan?

22:16.503 --> 22:18.881
I don't know.
I wasn't with her the whole time.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.683
Do you seriously think I planted evidence?

22:30.976 --> 22:33.187
That could be
how the matches got in there.

22:59.713 --> 23:00.797
Kirby?

23:07.804 --> 23:10.682
Hey, hey. Hey, no. You're okay.
You're okay, you're okay.

23:10.766 --> 23:11.975
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:13.769 --> 23:14.770
Hey, let's go.

23:31.495 --> 23:33.247
Your mom said she's gonna call later.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.754
Rachel doesn't understand
why you're not talking to her anymore.

23:42.631 --> 23:43.799
She seemed pretty wrecked about it.

23:43.882 --> 23:47.553
She asked tons of questions about you,
most of which I could not answer.

23:47.636 --> 23:48.637
Like what?

23:48.720 --> 23:51.306
We've never been to that bar.
Why were you there?

23:52.432 --> 23:53.433
It was a dead lead.

23:53.517 --> 23:54.977
And he just followed you in?

23:55.060 --> 24:00.107
Look, I've been going over this all day,
so can we just eat?

24:00.190 --> 24:03.485
Yes. Here you go, dig in.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.070
Thanks.

24:05.821 --> 24:07.990
This is-- What is this?

24:08.699 --> 24:11.159
Don't be modest about your creation.

24:12.286 --> 24:13.954
Is it bacon and-- Is it peanut butter?

24:14.037 --> 24:15.914
With grape jelly. It's your happy food.

24:16.707 --> 24:17.958
I've never had this before.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.669
What are you talking about?
I'm not taking credit for the combo.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.713
I'm serious. I don't know what this is.

24:22.796 --> 24:25.132
When you say shit like this,
I do not know what you want me to do.

24:25.215 --> 24:26.675
This isn't a test. I'm being honest.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.218
Fine, don't eat the sandwich.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.304
Well, maybe I like it. I don't know!

24:30.387 --> 24:31.513
Are you fucking with me?

24:31.597 --> 24:33.849
Because I cannot keep trying to guess
what's going on in your head.

24:33.932 --> 24:35.100
Never asked you to.

24:37.686 --> 24:38.687
What?

24:38.770 --> 24:42.983
I don't know. Kirby, I don't know.
I'm tired too. I'm tired too.

24:59.791 --> 25:00.876
It's good.

25:03.378 --> 25:04.379
I'm glad.

25:13.514 --> 25:16.266
You just missed us. The service is over.

25:17.226 --> 25:18.227
Can I help?

25:21.647 --> 25:23.148
You're Rachel, right?

25:23.941 --> 25:26.276
I'm Dan Velazquez. I'm with the Sun-Times.

25:28.403 --> 25:31.281
Did Sharon send you?
She left her phone off the hook.

25:32.074 --> 25:33.659
No, she doesn't know I'm here.

25:33.742 --> 25:36.495
Well, she's not returning
your calls either, huh?

25:37.496 --> 25:38.580
Why's she pissed at you?

25:38.664 --> 25:40.165
I'm sure I did something.

25:42.042 --> 25:46.421
What about you?
When was the last time you guys spoke?

25:48.924 --> 25:50.634
Why? What did she tell you?

25:51.301 --> 25:52.594
Not much.

25:52.678 --> 25:57.224
Well, if my daughter has something
she wants you to know, she will tell you.

25:57.307 --> 25:59.852
Yeah,
that's been my experience with her so far.

26:01.770 --> 26:02.980
Was she always like that?

26:03.063 --> 26:05.274
Look, I don't want to be quoted
in your paper, okay?

26:05.357 --> 26:07.401
I don't know how you duped Sharon into it,
but look what it got her.

26:07.484 --> 26:08.986
I'm not sure that's fair.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.822
She almost got killed last night.
Take some ownership.

26:15.659 --> 26:17.911
She ever have problems
with being reckless?

26:21.248 --> 26:22.791
You really don't know her, do you?

26:22.875 --> 26:25.794
Not even after the hospital?
I mean, she was in there for a while.

26:25.878 --> 26:29.214
-Her mental state couldn't have been good.
-Yeah, it was shitty. So what?

26:29.298 --> 26:32.509
So, was she ever unreliable?
Was she unstable?

26:32.593 --> 26:33.594
About what?

26:33.677 --> 26:35.929
She ever lied to you
about what happened to her?

26:36.013 --> 26:40.100
She's not a liar, and she is not crazy.

26:41.768 --> 26:46.148
That was my gig. I mean, one of us
had to have their shit together, right?

26:53.280 --> 26:55.908
No, leave that.
Let's go back to the Montreal one.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.203
Why, what's this?

27:00.662 --> 27:02.206
The MACV in Saigon.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.209
They look so young.

27:05.876 --> 27:06.877
We were.

27:09.421 --> 27:10.422
Who's that?

27:11.340 --> 27:14.218
That's Guzman.
Yeah, that's our tunnel rat.

27:14.927 --> 27:17.346
Sounds like a good time.

27:17.429 --> 27:21.308
Gosh. The VC, they dug
all these underground bunkers everywhere.

27:21.808 --> 27:25.604
And they'd booby-trap 'em
with mines, snakes, anything.

27:26.396 --> 27:27.856
When we come across one,
you gotta clear it.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.901
And that was Guzman's job.
The smallest guy in our platoon.

27:33.946 --> 27:35.364
Do you still talk to him?

27:36.782 --> 27:37.783
No, no, no, no.

27:38.283 --> 27:39.451
He didn't make it back.

27:43.330 --> 27:47.000
We were patrolling in the Cu Chi district
and came across a hole.

27:47.084 --> 27:50.379
Guzman didn't wanna clear it,
so I went for him.

27:50.462 --> 27:54.883
Took his flashlight and his revolver,
and climbed down.

27:57.135 --> 27:59.972
It was completely empty.
Somebody had already cleared it.

28:01.306 --> 28:02.850
While I'm figuring that out,

28:04.810 --> 28:07.354
my platoon was getting ambushed
on the top side.

28:11.275 --> 28:14.194
By the time that I climbed back up,
half of 'em were dead.

28:18.782 --> 28:19.783
Soâ€¦

28:25.038 --> 28:27.040
Do you ever think it should've been you?

28:27.749 --> 28:31.420
No. No, I don't think
it should've been any of us.

28:33.172 --> 28:34.631
But we don't get to choose.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.017
What's that?

28:46.518 --> 28:47.811
I don't remember him.

28:48.604 --> 28:49.605
No.

28:51.565 --> 28:52.941
His tattoo.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.110
Where's that from?

28:55.194 --> 28:58.488
That's probably from his battalion.
A lot of guys got that over there.

29:09.583 --> 29:10.918
He has the same tattoo.

29:12.127 --> 29:14.421
-That was on the guy from last night?
-Yeah.

29:15.339 --> 29:16.924
Well, he's military then.

29:59.842 --> 30:02.052
Jinny. Theo was looking for you.

30:02.135 --> 30:05.222
He said Grainger won't be free
for your run-through until tomorrow.

30:06.056 --> 30:09.601
Okay. Where are the kids?

30:10.143 --> 30:12.229
They were getting antsy. I sent 'em down.

30:54.521 --> 31:00.068
So, these are our bolometer readings.
They're how bright each star shines.

31:01.403 --> 31:08.076
And we use them to measure
how far away the stars are from us.

31:09.870 --> 31:11.914
And this is Jinny.

31:11.997 --> 31:15.000
She loves charts and children.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.753
So, Jinny, do you wanna, like,

31:17.836 --> 31:20.422
maybe tell them about your trip
to the Arecibo telescope?

31:22.591 --> 31:27.179
I'm sure they'd rather see the ones
that we have here. They're on the roof.

31:28.222 --> 31:30.807
Thank the scientist. Come on, guys.
Let's head out.

31:30.891 --> 31:32.184
-Thank you!
-Okay.

31:32.267 --> 31:34.102
-You're welcome.
-You're welcome. Bye.

31:34.186 --> 31:35.270
Bye, guys. Have fun.

31:37.981 --> 31:40.150
They're not gonna see anything
with the rain.

31:40.776 --> 31:43.487
Doesn't matter. Let them mess around.
They might get into it.

31:44.821 --> 31:48.033
Somehow, I do not think that
we have any Keplers in that bunch.

31:48.742 --> 31:51.662
Were you able to calibrate Ogden
for the live feed?

31:51.745 --> 31:54.081
I can't have a lag during my talk.

31:59.545 --> 32:01.380
They carry messages from the heavens.

32:04.132 --> 32:05.133
The--

32:05.217 --> 32:07.886
The ancient Egyptians,
it's what they said about bees.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.890
This one has no wings.

32:42.421 --> 32:43.797
I talked to Bertie.

32:44.882 --> 32:47.134
He said you asked for my notes
on Julia's clients.

32:48.302 --> 32:49.386
Only the veterans?

32:50.387 --> 32:52.055
I can't follow up on my own story?

32:55.642 --> 32:57.436
Julia's client's on the second floor.

33:07.196 --> 33:08.906
Excuse me. You need to sign in.

33:09.448 --> 33:12.534
Name, time, resident you're here to see.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.455
Fuck me. This is you, right?

33:18.081 --> 33:19.166
-Yeah.
-Not gonna lie,

33:19.249 --> 33:20.709
you look pretty rough here.

33:21.877 --> 33:24.379
They only use the glamour shots
if you get killed, soâ€¦

33:25.797 --> 33:27.382
I'm sorry that happened to you.

33:29.593 --> 33:31.220
Did you know Julia Madrigal?

33:31.303 --> 33:32.763
I usually work nights.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.890
She was real popular
with the residents though.

33:34.973 --> 33:37.434
Gordie's in room 203, upstairs.

33:37.518 --> 33:39.269
Do you mind if I hang one of these up?

33:46.777 --> 33:47.778
That's the guy?

33:49.196 --> 33:50.197
Yeah.

33:51.448 --> 33:52.616
Do you know him?

33:53.242 --> 33:55.327
Yeah, he's been here a bunch of times.

33:55.410 --> 33:56.703
He knew Julia?

33:56.787 --> 33:59.373
No, he wasn't here to see her.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.815
Why are all the rooms different?

34:26.440 --> 34:28.652
Well, all the residents on this floor
are memory-impaired.

34:29.570 --> 34:33.364
Mostly dementia, Alzheimer's.
But if they're here, they're advanced.

34:38.745 --> 34:41.831
With this population,
all we can really do is keep 'em calm.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.041
Keep 'em safe.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.085
The stuff in their rooms,
that's what they remember?

34:46.170 --> 34:49.715
Yeah, it's familiar.
We started doing it a year ago.

34:49.797 --> 34:50.841
Seems to help.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.849
I'm not sure how much Leo can tell ya.

34:58.932 --> 35:00.934
He has his good days and his bad days.

35:04.354 --> 35:05.898
He looks too young to be here.

35:05.981 --> 35:08.442
Alzheimer's? Early-onset?

35:08.525 --> 35:09.818
No, not from his scans.

35:09.902 --> 35:11.695
I don't think
they could find anything wrong with him.

35:12.279 --> 35:13.488
Must be psychological.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.036
What are all these?

35:19.119 --> 35:22.039
Hey, Leo, where'd you win all your medals?

35:22.122 --> 35:24.333
You got what, three, four of 'em?

35:26.752 --> 35:29.713
Gallipoli? That's World War One.

35:30.214 --> 35:32.925
Yeah. He kept trying to run away

35:33.008 --> 35:35.677
until I caught him
watching Paths of Glory downstairs.

35:35.761 --> 35:37.971
Once we put all this stuff up,
he stayed put.

35:38.055 --> 35:39.848
...please come to the front.

35:39.932 --> 35:42.309
-Hang out here for a minute.
-...please come to the front.

35:54.112 --> 35:55.113
Hey, Leo.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.451
I think we know your friend.

36:01.870 --> 36:05.082
Can you tell me about him?
Maybe he came here to see you?

36:12.881 --> 36:16.176
There might be some contact on file,
some family we could talk to.

36:17.427 --> 36:18.428
I'll stay with him.

36:33.402 --> 36:34.736
You were infantry?

36:37.656 --> 36:38.657
Like them?

36:42.786 --> 36:44.538
There are no other photos up.

36:47.291 --> 36:48.375
No family?

37:01.471 --> 37:05.767
What's his name, the man who visits you?

37:19.948 --> 37:23.577
Don't tell him that you came here, okay?

37:25.871 --> 37:26.872
Tell who?

37:32.878 --> 37:34.004
Is this him?

37:36.048 --> 37:38.300
He won't let me back.

37:39.343 --> 37:40.344
Back home?

37:40.844 --> 37:41.970
Back to the house.

37:43.889 --> 37:46.350
Where is it? We can go together.

37:46.433 --> 37:49.811
No, you stay away. Don't go near him.

37:50.521 --> 37:51.522
Okay.

37:52.940 --> 37:53.941
Okay.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.915
I'll tell him that you told me.

38:11.667 --> 38:13.085
What did I say?

38:14.044 --> 38:16.255
You told me where to find him.

38:17.965 --> 38:22.219
I did? When?

38:24.596 --> 38:25.597
Just now.

38:27.724 --> 38:30.644
Does he know that--
Does he know that I took it?

38:32.646 --> 38:33.647
Uh-huh.

38:36.692 --> 38:37.943
That's why I'm here.

38:38.026 --> 38:43.782
I have to take it back and give it to him.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.995
But you don't know him. You can't.

38:50.247 --> 38:51.373
I know him.

38:57.004 --> 38:58.714
You told me where to find him.

38:59.381 --> 39:02.301
No. No, I didn't.

39:03.802 --> 39:05.387
But he won't know that.

39:07.139 --> 39:09.641
Not after I find him
and tell him it was you.

39:47.846 --> 39:49.056
Give it back to him.

39:52.392 --> 39:54.895
Please just don't tell him I took it.

39:57.397 --> 39:58.815
All right, you ready?

39:59.775 --> 40:00.776
Let's see.

40:02.528 --> 40:03.654
All right, get going.

40:07.741 --> 40:09.243
No, no, not like that.

40:10.369 --> 40:14.039
Like Teenie's. Just be you. No French.

40:15.749 --> 40:18.502
-Why? It remind you too much of Paris?
-Yeah, maybe.

40:18.585 --> 40:20.462
That's him. That's his voice.

40:20.546 --> 40:22.172
I know you never made it there.

40:22.256 --> 40:24.007
-Leo said so.
-He doesn't know.

40:24.091 --> 40:25.425
Camera's rolling. You gonna start?

40:25.509 --> 40:26.802
She knows him.

40:26.885 --> 40:28.679
No, I'm not.

40:32.683 --> 40:33.767
Turn it off.

41:17.394 --> 41:18.520
Hey, Jinny.

41:30.866 --> 41:32.075
How do you know Sharon?

41:35.412 --> 41:36.705
I saw you two together.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.337
You mean Kirby?

41:46.423 --> 41:47.591
That's not her name.

41:51.803 --> 41:53.597
I want you to talk to her for me.

41:57.351 --> 42:00.562
Sure. I can do that.
What do you want me to say?

42:00.646 --> 42:02.064
You're already saying it.

42:05.192 --> 42:09.780
Yeah. See, when Iâ€¦

42:13.575 --> 42:15.285
When I feel something, she knows.

42:18.455 --> 42:20.374
Did you find any contacts in the records?

42:20.457 --> 42:23.418
Leo is a ward of the state.
I'll check with the VA.

42:25.087 --> 42:28.131
What? What is it?

42:30.425 --> 42:31.552
It's not your car.

42:38.350 --> 42:40.185
She knows, andâ€¦

42:42.521 --> 42:43.522
Yeah.

42:47.651 --> 42:50.571
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I told you.

42:53.031 --> 42:54.032
Not today.

44:01.517 --> 44:02.768
I'm gonna take the train.

44:06.063 --> 44:07.773
What do you think I drove here?

44:15.113 --> 44:17.324
A Celica. Tan.

44:18.158 --> 44:20.410
The seat belt on my side, it was broken.

44:20.911 --> 44:24.039
Whoever sat there must have smoked.
There were burns by the window.

44:25.290 --> 44:26.291
You are right.

44:26.375 --> 44:29.294
My ex-wife didn't give a shit
about that car.

44:29.378 --> 44:31.296
-You remember it?
-Yeah.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.591
I sold it a couple of years ago,
and definitely didn't drive it here.

44:36.176 --> 44:39.388
When things change for you,
do you recognize it?

44:40.430 --> 44:41.431
Sometimes.

44:42.599 --> 44:44.434
Other times, they're just random.

44:45.018 --> 44:46.436
Maybe they're what's to come.
