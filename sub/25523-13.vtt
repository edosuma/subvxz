WEBVTT

00:27.569 --> 00:29.404
Chapo! Give yourself up!

00:45.462 --> 00:46.463
Stay still!

00:46.546 --> 00:47.881
Chapo, drop your gun!

00:49.966 --> 00:51.718
It's not El Chapo!

00:59.768 --> 01:01.478
DISE INTELLIGENCE CENTER
VIEWING OFFICE

01:02.896 --> 01:03.897
Understood.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.318
They lost him.

01:14.282 --> 01:17.494
Reinforce the security in all
the perimeter around Cosala!

01:17.827 --> 01:19.996
Nothing moves unless
we know about it!

01:22.457 --> 01:23.291
COSALA MOUNTAINS
SINALOA, MEXICO

01:23.374 --> 01:25.418
How long until
we get to Puerto La Cruz?

01:25.502 --> 01:26.836
We can't go anymore.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.047
Conrado already knows
we are in the area.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.925
There aren't any mountains along the coast
to hide us from their radars.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.385
If we leave the mountains,
the plane will be detected.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.304
Let’s go to my turf, sir.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.516
The state police is still
loyal to me in there.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.101
We'll be safe for some days, at least.

01:43.102 --> 01:44.229
Let's go to Guamuchil.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.653
Did the plane show up?

02:05.667 --> 02:09.879
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:09.963 --> 02:14.134
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

02:14.300 --> 02:18.805
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:18.888 --> 02:25.186
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

02:25.895 --> 02:29.482
Even when the clouds drift away

02:29.858 --> 02:33.528
Even when my skin dries away

02:33.778 --> 02:37.866
I'll be back someday

02:38.199 --> 02:42.829
To unleash my return

02:47.083 --> 02:51.421
I have the dust that protects the road

02:51.546 --> 02:56.134
I have the branches of a leafless tree

02:56.217 --> 03:00.263
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:00.346 --> 03:06.144
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

03:07.353 --> 03:10.857
Even when the clouds drift away

03:11.357 --> 03:14.944
Even when my skin dries away

03:15.778 --> 03:19.616
I'll be back someday

03:20.033 --> 03:24.162
To unleash my return

04:22.470 --> 04:23.513
Get him up.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.417
What do you have here, Commander?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.296
Drunk fight.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.230
Go ahead.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.238
Sending regards to all my nephews,
roger that?

06:04.405 --> 06:05.782
Uncle, it’s great to hear from you.

06:05.907 --> 06:06.991
What's up, Uncle?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.159
Uncle, roger that.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.952
I am in the city and your auntie
is with me.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.913
I'll see you at home
to open the gifts.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.539
I’m glad that auntie made it safely.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.626
Tell auntie we are at her service.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.540
The federal police haven't even
showed up around here.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.043
My guys out there
will keep you safe.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.840
Get me a doctor.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.260
Go get a doctor.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.179
Is it for auntie?

07:10.304 --> 07:11.639
Affirmative.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.225
Is it serious?

07:14.642 --> 07:16.853
No, but her leg is bleeding.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.234
Its me. Let me talk to the boss.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.197
MEXICO CITY

07:29.198 --> 07:30.074
Come in.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.827
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE

07:32.910 --> 07:33.828
Any news?

07:35.705 --> 07:37.206
We were close to catching him.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.251
It's just a matter of time.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.553
Time is the last thing we have
to spare, Conrado.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.726
Every day El Chapo is free,

07:59.061 --> 08:00.813
my reputation gets worse and worse.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.773
I know.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.442
And I am sorry about it.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.321
Someone has to pay the political price
for all this,

08:09.322 --> 08:12.575
and ultimately, you're the responsible
for this country's security.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.911
I won't leave you hanging,

08:15.244 --> 08:17.038
but I need you to sign
your resignation.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.585
I will leave you in the shadows
for a couple of months and then...

08:24.629 --> 08:26.547
I can make you secretary of tourism.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.263
It's too late for that, Mr. President.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.393
You should have asked
for my resignation

08:39.477 --> 08:40.978
when El Chapo escaped.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.941
Now it would only look
like a desperate measure.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.069
I don't believe it's ever too late
to flex your power.

08:50.655 --> 08:54.116
You, better than anyone, know than
a delayed reaction is equal to nothing.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.537
Besides, my separation
from the cabinet

08:57.620 --> 08:59.830
should be consulted
with the ex-president.

08:59.914 --> 09:00.748
Of course.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.375
I'll inform him myself...

09:03.709 --> 09:05.836
as soon as you sign
the resignation.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.134
RESIGNATION LETTER

09:16.681 --> 09:17.807
I am not signing it.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.059
Don’t make this into a conflict, Conrado.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.479
If you force me to sign it,

09:25.022 --> 09:27.692
I'll say El Chapo financed
your presidential campaign

09:29.277 --> 09:31.195
and that I arranged it all myself,

09:31.320 --> 09:34.198
with your full knowledge and consent.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.117
No one will believe you.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.704
I will also say that you let him escape

09:39.829 --> 09:42.748
because you owed him for helping you
to win the presidency.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.336
You are declaring war On me.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.132
If I lose, you lose too.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.304
Nice seeing you, Mr. President.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.351
I'll inform you when
we capture El Chapo Guzman.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.816
Roger that, thank you.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.861
The bay will be free
of the marines at night.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.487
That's where the fishing boats are.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.282
Any of them can take you
to international waters.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.075
From there to Colombia
or anywhere.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.910
Navachiste is Isidoro's turf.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.330
Then let's leave from any port
in Sonora.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.373
Plus, we’ll be exposed if we travel
on the ground.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.583
Maybe not.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.586
There’s always a way, Chilo.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.839
We just have to find it.

10:33.174 --> 10:37.011
A war against the president
is not a smart move, Conrado.

10:39.388 --> 10:42.058
-I didn't have a choice.
-It might be.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.311
It might be, but this is
the second time

10:45.394 --> 10:46.854
you've made important decisions
without consulting me.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.940
I hope you are not getting used to it.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.528
I’d take it as a lack of loyalty.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.322
Never.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.370
Good.

11:07.500 --> 11:12.046
If there's something I can't tolerate,
is disloyalty.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.342
Berta understands that very well,
so I hope you do too.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.428
Of course.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.223
Well, then focus in catching El Chapo
once and for all.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.184
Only with that triumph we’ll make sure
the president will be neutralized.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.352
Yes, sir.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.695
-Good night.
-Good night.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.771
I need to talk to you.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.628
Stay still, asshole!

13:07.328 --> 13:08.579
Is the "auntie" El Chapo?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.124
No.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.556
EL CHAPO GUZMAN INJURES LEG AFTER ESCAPING
OPERATIVE IN COSALA

13:29.600 --> 13:33.062
We can do this the easy way,
or the hard way.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.855
Last chance.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.235
That auntie who needed a doctor

13:39.318 --> 13:41.445
because her leg was bleeding,

13:41.779 --> 13:43.113
was that El Chapo?

13:54.583 --> 13:57.711
Where in Guamuchil
is he hiding?

14:16.772 --> 14:18.274
Was this what you wanted?

14:52.433 --> 14:54.268
Get out of here, asshole!
Get out!

15:14.872 --> 15:15.873
He's over there!

15:47.738 --> 15:48.781
General?

15:48.864 --> 15:52.076
El Chapo is in Guamuchil.
We have witnesses.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.911
He had a shootout with Isidoro.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.204
Were the exits closed?

15:55.287 --> 15:57.039
-That's right.
-I'm on my way.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.002
Hello?

16:02.252 --> 16:04.797
I am stuck in Guamuchil
in a safe house.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.382
I need you to help me get out of here.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.675
Where do you want to go?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.386
To the last place
they'd expect me to go.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.514
I want details.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.308
Apparently he was trying
to get out of Guamuchil

16:16.392 --> 16:18.394
hiding in the hidden compartment
of a pick-up truck.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.354
We've got surveillance
at every exit

16:20.437 --> 16:23.983
and we've found and dismantled
several clandestine landing sites.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.820
We've reinforced the security
in all his territories in the area.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.031
These other turfs
belong to Isidoro.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.616
He can't go through there.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.248
We are assuming he can't.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.666
What do you mean?

16:40.749 --> 16:42.167
If I was El Chapo,

16:42.251 --> 16:45.587
I would hide exactly where people
are less expecting me to hide.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.465
Establish some surveillance
around Isidoro’s zones.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.717
But, Mr. Secretary...

16:49.800 --> 16:52.219
El Chapo wouldn't want to hide
in the wolf's den.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.847
He will if he thinks
he can distract us.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.598
It's worth the shot.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.309
Do as I say.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.241
Have a nice day.

17:20.581 --> 17:21.957
JUAN SANTIAGO
UNDERCOVER FEDERAL AGENT

17:22.041 --> 17:22.916
What am I good for?

17:23.125 --> 17:26.003
Commander, we need you to focus
on a single target.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.130
Report any movement

17:28.213 --> 17:30.090
from the Sinaloa Cartel,
at each and every level.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.216
Count on that.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.253
We hadn't seen you
in a long time, Juan Santiago.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.130
Do you have information,
or do you want some?

18:10.214 --> 18:12.132
I need info from your sources.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.842
Who are you looking for?

18:19.640 --> 18:22.684
Have you seen any out of the ordinary
movements from the Sinaloa Cartel?

18:22.768 --> 18:25.896
No, they’ve scattered like rats
since Isidoro took this turf.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.941
If anything catches your eye,
let me know.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.497
-We’re closed!
-It's Juanito.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.374
I am looking for your brother.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.626
What do you want now, Juanito?

18:47.751 --> 18:50.796
If I tell you I’m looking for El Chapo
around here, would you believe me?

18:51.338 --> 18:54.091
Do you really think he’d come
to fuck with Isidoro?

18:54.174 --> 18:55.759
Tell your people to stay alert,

18:55.843 --> 18:57.427
and if they see something unusual,
let me know.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.096
Alright.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.515
Also, tell your boss
I want to speak to him.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.022
Hello?

19:09.273 --> 19:11.191
El Chapo doesn’t have the balls
to come into Los Mochis.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.234
OUTSIDE OF GUAMUCHIL

19:12.317 --> 19:13.777
Where do you think he is?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.571
In the mountains, where else?

19:15.654 --> 19:17.072
I’m looking for him there.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.615
If you find him, let me know.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.451
If I find him, I’ll kill him.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.265
MOVING SERVICES INSIDE
AND OUT OF LOS MOCHIS

20:20.427 --> 20:21.970
Go get Chilo quickly.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.265
Hurry.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.896
Bring him some water.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.566
Joaquín, with all due respect,

20:34.733 --> 20:36.610
it’s crazy to have you
hiding around here.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.153
On the contrary,

20:38.487 --> 20:40.447
there’s no better place to hide.
No one will expect it.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.241
How long are you planning to stay?

20:42.366 --> 20:44.993
A few days. As soon as things
calm down a little,

20:45.077 --> 20:48.205
I need to see what the safest port is
for me to leave the country.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.388
Are you hungry, fellas?

21:04.471 --> 21:05.973
Always, sir.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.100
Get something to eat for everyone.

21:14.731 --> 21:15.649
Evening.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.652
I want 200 tacos, please.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.696
A hundred with steak only,
and a hundred with cheese.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.739
Wow, where's the party.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.993
Give me five minutes
and I’ll prepare the order.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.494
-Sure.
-Chivo!

21:27.577 --> 21:29.413
Bring more tortillas!

21:29.496 --> 21:32.374
We’ll need double
for our special friends!

21:49.141 --> 21:50.058
Come on.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.399
Juanito.

23:27.322 --> 23:28.573
Good evening.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.243
Do these run 24 hours?

23:45.924 --> 23:48.844
General? I’m sending you
the surveillance recordings

23:48.927 --> 23:51.179
from the street
where the house is located.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.141
These are from last week.

23:58.645 --> 23:59.771
Are they here?

24:00.564 --> 24:01.857
They’re coming in now.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.736
The house is registered as
one of Marcelo’s Safe houses.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.447
It was under surveillance
while he was a turf boss.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.116
Are those Marcelo’s hitmen?

24:11.199 --> 24:12.492
Might be.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.662
The commander said they bought
two hundred tacos.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.873
The videos are downloaded, play them.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.171
Why would Marcelo
want new furniture?

24:28.884 --> 24:31.011
I need you to begin
the Black Swan operation.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.028
Police, everyone, freeze!

24:48.820 --> 24:50.739
Freeze! Get in!

24:53.533 --> 24:55.493
Freeze! Let’s go! Careful!

25:02.626 --> 25:04.211
Freeze!

25:12.093 --> 25:15.430
Freeze! On the ground!
Drop your gun!

25:17.515 --> 25:20.352
Get upstairs!

25:20.435 --> 25:22.229
Search for the target!

25:23.188 --> 25:24.481
Get in, now!

25:47.212 --> 25:48.713
Hallway!

25:48.797 --> 25:50.632
Left door, right door!

26:20.537 --> 26:22.664
Sir! No sign of the target!

26:22.789 --> 26:25.709
Search every corner.
There are holes in the closets.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.585
He must be here.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.214
Look for a tunnel!

26:31.673 --> 26:34.843
I don’t care what you do!
Get information from his men!

26:35.760 --> 26:37.429
We can’t waste any more time!

27:32.400 --> 27:35.695
Goddammit, we’re out of gas.
We have to get another car.

27:49.709 --> 27:50.960
Get down!

27:59.219 --> 28:00.470
Let's go!

28:11.147 --> 28:13.608
The woman stated
two armed individuals

28:13.691 --> 28:14.818
stole her car

28:14.901 --> 28:17.821
at the intersection of Diez de Mayo
and Francisco Javier Minas.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.657
That’s in Juquilpan. Right next
to the Escali neighborhood,

28:20.740 --> 28:22.200
in the middle of Los Mochis.

28:22.283 --> 28:25.620
That’s him. I need every police officer
in Los Mochis to be after him right now.

28:25.703 --> 28:28.081
There’s been information
about a stolen car

28:28.164 --> 28:29.290
with the following characteristics:

28:29.374 --> 28:31.334
Ford Focus, red,

28:31.418 --> 28:36.548
with plate number
Bravo, Golfo, Kilo, 1456.

28:36.631 --> 28:41.428
The theft occurred at the intersection of
10 de Mayo and Fco. Javier Minas avenue.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.180
It’s a number one priority,
I repeat, number one priority.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.974
The red Ford focus
might be on its way

28:46.057 --> 28:48.226
to the 20 De Noviembre exit.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.157
Fuck!

29:02.240 --> 29:04.117
We won't make it to the mountains.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.452
They probably already
gave out the warning,

29:05.535 --> 29:07.454
but it’s just the two of them.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.289
I think we should go out,
guns blazing.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.750
We won’t be make it
in a shootout.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.919
We have to buy them out,
so they help us reach the coast.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.045
Are you sure?

29:17.630 --> 29:19.549
We don't have a choice. Stop the car.

29:26.055 --> 29:28.516
We’ve got five units
with 20 officers on their way.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.060
Drop your weapons! Get out of the vehicle,
hands in the air!

29:34.272 --> 29:35.815
Let's talk!

29:48.578 --> 29:50.330
Gentlemen, do you know who am I?

29:52.415 --> 29:54.042
Help me get to the mountains...

29:54.501 --> 29:57.170
and you won't have to worry
about anything ever again.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.964
Ask for whatever you want:
one, two or three million dollars.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.511
Get down! Face down!

30:56.396 --> 30:57.772
We got them!

31:03.444 --> 31:04.946
Mr. Secretary,

31:06.155 --> 31:07.991
congratulations, well done.

31:08.074 --> 31:09.242
Thank you.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.595
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:

31:28.678 --> 31:35.143
I’D LIKE TO INFORM THE MEXICAN PEOPLE

31:35.226 --> 31:39.397
THAT JOAQUÍN GUZMÁN LOERA

31:39.480 --> 31:41.941
HAS BEEN DETAINED.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.909
The leader
of the Sinaloa Cartel

31:53.077 --> 31:55.288
He was moved to Mexico City,
where the president confirmed

31:55.371 --> 31:57.498
the re-capture of
the Sinaloa Cartel leader.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.209
Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán...

32:02.962 --> 32:04.547
...is back behind bars tonight.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.674
He was detained in the city of Los Mochis

32:06.799 --> 32:09.302
Six months after escaping from
a maximum security prison.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.098
The drug lord's escape destabilized
the Mexican government.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.434
Recapturing him even became
an affair of state.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.895
Every news outlet
from all over the world

32:18.978 --> 32:20.104
is present here today.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.065
At the PGR hangar,

32:22.148 --> 32:24.859
at the Mexico City international airport.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.403
On board that ANX2226

32:27.487 --> 32:29.155
that belongs to the Mexican marines

32:29.238 --> 32:31.032
El Chapo is coming out.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.034
That’s right, right now
they’re moving El Chapo Guzmán...

32:33.117 --> 32:34.661
Which is why I’d like to read

32:34.744 --> 32:37.622
the president’s tweet out loud:

32:39.415 --> 32:41.125
"Mission accomplished.

32:42.126 --> 32:46.255
I’d like to inform the Mexican people
that Joaquín Guzmán Loera

32:47.090 --> 32:48.424
has been detained".

32:59.894 --> 33:02.522
The secretary of state,
Conrado Sol,

33:02.605 --> 33:06.150
has achieved great success
by capturing El Chapo Guzmán,

33:06.275 --> 33:09.153
the most wanted drug lord in the world.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.905
Thank you very much.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.574
The Mexican people can’t forget
the fact that the president

33:13.658 --> 33:15.410
still hasn’t given us an explanation

33:15.493 --> 33:18.371
explanation about the killing
of the Ayotzinapa students,

33:18.454 --> 33:20.873
nor about the so-called
"White House".

33:20.957 --> 33:23.668
You can’t make the president responsible
for such happening.

33:23.751 --> 33:24.669
-Of course I can...
-Yes?

33:26.587 --> 33:27.839
Thank you very much.

33:27.922 --> 33:31.050
Conrado Sol is the only one
that’s safe in that cabinet,

33:31.134 --> 33:33.720
and he’s proven that
by capturing El Chapo.

33:34.721 --> 33:35.722
Sir!

33:35.805 --> 33:38.808
The Secretary of State
took on this situation very well.

33:38.891 --> 33:41.477
He returned from Paris
and was able to contain the crisis.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.565
And that’s what you expect
from the government.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.677
Congratulations, Conrado.
Your plan has been a hit.

34:15.970 --> 34:17.055
Thank you.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.474
A bright future awaits us.

34:24.854 --> 34:26.481
To loyalty.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.281
You should always be loyal

34:35.364 --> 34:36.616
to those who feed you,

34:37.950 --> 34:39.994
and you just wanted to make
a fool out of me.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.500
Berta already told me
you keep seeing that boy.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.130
It’s my turn, Conrado.

34:52.173 --> 34:54.884
Now I’ll be the presidential candidate,
and not you.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.470
But don’t worry,

34:57.553 --> 34:59.722
you are still of use to us.

35:00.848 --> 35:04.268
Thanks to your newfound credibility,
you’ll support me in everything you can,

35:04.352 --> 35:06.145
so I can grow politically.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.980
And of course, you won’t say a word

35:08.106 --> 35:10.066
about Berta’s apartment
in Miami.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.070
If you don’t accept these new conditions,

35:15.279 --> 35:18.199
all of Mexico will find out
you’re a homosexual.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.330
and you know corruption
doesn’t take away any points,

35:25.832 --> 35:27.917
but being openly homosexual does.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.587
I told you,

35:33.172 --> 35:35.424
my godfather doesn’t forgive disloyalty.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.302
It was a mistake, sir.

35:39.428 --> 35:41.097
Please, let me show you

35:41.180 --> 35:42.932
I can still be trusted.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.851
It’s too late.

35:56.946 --> 35:59.907
There’s nothing you can do
to restore my faith in you.

36:43.117 --> 36:44.327
What are you doing here?

36:56.172 --> 36:57.590
I’ve lost everything.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.303
What did you lose?
Didn’t you just catch El Chapo?

37:09.977 --> 37:12.313
The former president
has stopped supporting me.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.568
I won’t be a presidential candidate.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.206
Come here...

37:49.392 --> 37:50.601
You can’t see it now,

37:50.685 --> 37:52.770
but it’s the best thing
that could’ve happened to you.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.356
You’ll be free, Conrado.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.152
You’re finally going to be able
to live as you please.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.783
Being president is the only way
I wanted to live.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.829
Don’t say that.

38:13.791 --> 38:17.503
Power is an addiction just like
all the others, and you can overcome it.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.394
I’m sorry.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.652
This is the only way.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.116
The only way to do what?

38:49.535 --> 38:50.911
Take my power back.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.535
Conrado has shown me
his great ability

40:12.827 --> 40:15.996
and decision making in times of crisis.

40:17.289 --> 40:22.086
His loyalty, commitment
and love for Mexico

40:22.378 --> 40:23.963
have no equal.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.136
Tell us how the hell you managed

40:30.219 --> 40:32.847
to remain untarnished after
Esteban Prieto's government.

40:33.347 --> 40:35.099
Did you sell your soul
to the devil or what?

40:39.353 --> 40:40.229
Yes.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.023
That’s exactly what I did.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.943
Well, gentlemen,

40:46.026 --> 40:48.112
I think we all know
why we are here.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.870
Let’s toast to
the next president of Mexico!

40:56.954 --> 40:57.955
Gentlemen.

41:18.684 --> 41:20.895
ALMOLOYA PRISON, MEXICO

41:23.189 --> 41:24.482
And the girls?

41:24.732 --> 41:26.066
They are fine.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.945
They’re too little, they don’t understand
anything that’s going on.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.407
And how's my mom?

41:34.575 --> 41:36.076
Well, you can imagine.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.913
Your mom is strong, though.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.165
We’re all taking care of her.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.337
And Quino?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.215
He’s fine, dedicated to his work.

41:55.137 --> 41:56.597
How are they treating you?

42:01.602 --> 42:03.187
I can barely sleep.

42:04.271 --> 42:05.898
I’m scared that they might extradite you.

42:08.692 --> 42:09.818
They won’t do that.

42:10.569 --> 42:12.571
I still have some bargaining room.

42:13.489 --> 42:16.325
I’ve got information about politicians
and government officials

42:16.450 --> 42:19.161
that have been paid by my organization
in the last twenty years.

42:21.539 --> 42:26.210
If I fall, half the government will too,
and even the DEA.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.839
The situation looks bad now,
but soon enough it’ll get better.

42:32.341 --> 42:33.425
You’ll see.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.098
JANUARY 19, 2017

43:20.264 --> 43:23.309
Police, everyone freeze!

43:32.192 --> 43:34.361
The marines should be
right at the exit.

43:40.159 --> 43:41.910
You’re asking too much of me.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.412
We can’t go on from here.

43:43.495 --> 43:44.788
We have to get out.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.837
Or stay down here.

44:07.770 --> 44:10.105
I could’ve avoided
my extradition.

44:14.401 --> 44:15.486
Sir!

44:29.083 --> 44:30.542
I’m El Chapo Guzmán!

44:31.794 --> 44:33.921
I always find a way out!

44:53.315 --> 44:58.153
ACCORDING TO THE EXTRADITION TREATY
BETWEEN THE US AND MEXICO,

44:58.237 --> 45:03.200
EL CHAPO CANNOT FACE THE DEATH PENALTY,
BUT CAN FACE A LIFE SENTENCE.

45:13.794 --> 45:17.589
ACCORDING TO NEWS REPORTS,
EL CHAPO CONFESSED TO

45:17.673 --> 45:21.135
KILLING BETWEEN
2,000 AND 3,000 PEOPLE.

45:21.218 --> 45:25.639
2,000 AND 3,000 PEOPLE.

46:10.976 --> 46:13.061
IN MEMORY OF
JUAN CARLOS OLIVAS

46:15.606 --> 46:16.940
