- Oh, I hope Dave's mum's okay.
- Hmm.

Still, at least she's in the
right place, I.E. Not here.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.400

Kim, is it really the right day
for you to give up smoking?

been rushed in to a&amp;E?

Look, if you're worried, I'll
get Pam from Everest to cover.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.240
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, no, no. It's fine.

-Yeah, I'm good. Denise flixter.

- Nurse: Good. Yeah.
- I just wanted to cancel my scan.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.280
Oh. Would you like
to rebook or anything?

01:37.440 --> 01:40.240

Would you like to come in?

to cancel or rebook.

but we've got it all set up, so...

- Okay.
- Thank you. I won't cancel.

here to have your 12-week full scan.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.480
I'll deal with this, Kim.

Good chance for you gen up on modern

I'm modern matron Damaris.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.560
You must be mrs dingsdale.

- Donald: Yeah. There you go.
- Damaris: I'll take that for you. Hi, Donald.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.120
- Is this a private ward?
- No, this is the main ward,

02:24.280 --> 02:28.400
but we're all on the same step of
the strategic stairway as our clients.

02:28.560 --> 02:32.160
Er, only my son told me that

02:32.320 --> 02:35.520
I must see that they
put me on a private ward.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.600
Right, well, I'm going to see if I
can escalate that with admissions.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.440
Okay? Kim, could you help mrs dingsdale
into bed and ask her for a lunch order?

02:43.600 --> 02:45.360
- Donald: Okay.
- Thanks, Donald.

- Do you want to just help mrs dingsdale into the chair

02:47.600 --> 02:49.480
and I'll just do the
curtain. Thanks, Donald.

your feet out the way there.

No, I haven't had any bleeding.

of eyes to have a little look. Okay?

03:28.040 --> 03:29.960
Is there something wrong?

03:30.120 --> 03:32.016
I'm just going to get one of my

It's got a specially
weighted nib.

Yes, I actually found it as I was rooting
through a box of Philip's old things,

04:28.640 --> 04:30.840
and it was an old
anniversary present.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.480
I'm not going to lean my
whole weight on it, am I?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.880

suggesting you were going to do that.

Dr Moore, I don't know if
I'm speaking out of turn here,

but if I got a present from
someone I was splitting up with,

04:44.360 --> 04:47.800
I wouldn't particularly want to be walking
around with it and keeping it. I mean,

04:47.960 --> 04:50.640
I chucked Dave's last
anniversary present out the window

04:50.800 --> 04:53.840
when he was a bit leery
with some woman in the pub.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.240

have thought so for a minute.

- Right, where is den?
- She's at her 12-week scan.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.776
All right. Well, I'll be
back in 10 minutes.

could you tell her

promptly this morning, please?

just need to speak to you.

about reorganisation services.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.760
Oh, congratulations, that's...

05:27.920 --> 05:30.800
No, I thought it'd be fantastic
if you could input into it.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.400
Yeah, sure, whatever,
you know, if I can help at all.

05:33.560 --> 05:39.360

much old. Sorry, den!

07:27.680 --> 07:28.680
Sorry?

Just an unfortunate
choice of words,

07:30.920 --> 07:34.760
an "old woman" having
a baby, rather than a...

07:34.920 --> 07:38.840
So it's a lady over the age
of 35 having her first child.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.920

Obviously from the Latin.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.760

'cause it means the patient's
got no idea what you're saying.

Yes, I think that's if you're planning on
being a doctor, which you are, aren't you,

07:49.960 --> 07:52.440
you will need to know
a little bit of Latin, so...

07:52.600 --> 07:54.320
You've all done Latin,
presumably, have you?

07:54.440 --> 07:56.840

- Yes, indeed. All righty.

- This is the private patient?
- No, that's mrs dingsdale.

dingsdale first, then, please.

How do you do? I'm dr Moore.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.976

- Hello, dr Moore.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.200
Hello there.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.800
I've promised
professor portnoy-noor

08:41.960 --> 08:43.400
I'm going to keep
a close eye on you,

08:43.520 --> 08:45.120
so you're in good hands.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.160
Yes, mrs dingsdale is in
for a small just cyst removal.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.600
She's having a lipoma excised.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.680
She would normally be
an outpatient, but she's...

08:51.760 --> 08:54.280
Yes, so normally this would
be done in the outpatient...

08:54.440 --> 08:56.640
not very steady on her
feet and she lives alone.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.776
Living alone at the moment, so we want
to make sure she's completely recovered

08:59.800 --> 09:02.360
before we send her off home
again, so it's just very much

09:02.520 --> 09:06.040
a question of making sure you're
absolutely right before we send you off.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.680
Could I have a private
room? I am a private patient.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.160
You are. Yes, yes.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.376
I'm sure that sister will be able to, um,
probably in the process of organising that

09:14.400 --> 09:15.856
- for you right now.
- I don't have a room.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.680
I'm sure that
somebody will be looking

09:17.840 --> 09:20.016
- into that at the moment.
- I swear I don't actually have any rooms.

09:20.040 --> 09:23.840
I have absolutely no beds. I'm sorry,
I can't organise anything different.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.200
We need to sort something out.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.040
Are you prepared
to see mrs Ellis now?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.360
Yes.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.760
Good morning.
How are you feeling?

09:31.920 --> 09:33.680
Yes, you might remember
mrs Ellis, dr Moore.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.920
Yes, of course I do.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.416
She came from the tall trees residential
home with a touch of pneumonia.

09:38.440 --> 09:42.360
You prescribed amoxicillin
orally, and dexamethasone.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.000
Why have we done that, gents?

09:44.160 --> 09:46.216
You need to keep up to speed
with current research here,

09:46.240 --> 09:50.280
so what's the reason for utilising
that alongside your antibiotic course?

09:50.440 --> 09:53.056
Actually, a recent Dutch study
showed that steroids can speed recovery

09:53.080 --> 09:55.240
- and cut admission time.
- Very good.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.816
Den: Yes, Dutch are
brilliant, aren't they?

09:56.840 --> 09:59.240
-Pippa: Er, yes.
-Love Holland. Especially Amsterdam.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.960
- Pippa: Yes indeed. So...
- Some great times there.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.400
So how are you
feeling now, mrs Ellis?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.360
Still got some problems
with the breathing,

10:06.520 --> 10:07.880
and I think this is probably

10:08.040 --> 10:10.080
because she's not
actually opened her bowels.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.320
I haven't been for five days.

10:12.480 --> 10:17.000
Righto. So, den, if you want to organise
some microlax enema, that would be super.

10:17.160 --> 10:21.480
Yes, great, okay. Kim! Sorry, Kim.
We need to organise an enema.

10:21.640 --> 10:22.776
You'd like me to do that, then?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.760
Thank you, yes.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.120
All right? Jolly good. And once
we've got things shifting through,

10:28.280 --> 10:30.256
I think you're going to
feel a lot more comfortable.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.520
She does require something more than
just being comfortable I think, dr Moore.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.960
Thank you, mrs Ellis.
It's more than comfortable.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.120
I mean, she's really
struggling with her breathing.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.280
- Well, she's got pneumonia, den.
- Yeah, obviously.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.136
Is there something the
matter with you today?

10:42.160 --> 10:44.160
I'm fine, thank you.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.160
- Pippa: Mrs Lewis.
- Nurse: Hello, mrs Lewis.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.880
- Den: This is Gwen Lewis.
- Pippa: Yes.

10:56.120 --> 11:00.520
Den, is there no way we can find
a private ward for mrs dingsdale?

11:00.680 --> 11:03.360
It's just that dr kersley
referred her to the professor,

11:03.520 --> 11:05.360
and I'd really like
to help Benedict out.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.280
I have said, dr Moore, I
do not have any space.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.456
Pippa: Look, whether we like this or not,
this is the way that things are heading,

11:12.480 --> 11:13.776
so, you know, I think
it's quite important

11:13.800 --> 11:16.480
that we support dr kersley's
initiatives at this stage.

11:16.640 --> 11:20.680
So if you could have
perhaps just another look...

11:20.840 --> 11:22.456
- Sorry, I've got to...
- [Mobile ringing]

11:22.480 --> 11:24.760
Excuse me a moment. I'm
so sorry. Jenny, hello, yes.

11:24.920 --> 11:28.160
Are we all set for
tomorrow? Right. I see.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.840
What if Philip changes his mind?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.760
I'm just worried that
Michelle might get at him.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.520
Yes, I will do. I will
do. All right. Yes.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.480
Indeed. Yes. Thanks, Jenny,
thanks very much indeed.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.000
All right, then, bye-bye.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.280
Den? Are you all right?

11:51.440 --> 11:54.800
I'm fine, thank you,
Kim. Absolutely fine.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.280
[Sighs]

12:01.560 --> 12:04.600
- Actually, I was...
- Oh, hang on a minute.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.920
- Kim: Hello, Donald!
- Den: What's this?

12:07.080 --> 12:09.680
- Donald: I don't know, but it's for you, den.
- Den: What is that?

12:09.800 --> 12:12.520
- Kim: A pressie from someone?
- Den: Oh, let's have a look.

12:12.680 --> 12:16.360
- Well, come on, get excited!
- Kim, no, it's for me.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.000
Please can you let me open it?

12:18.160 --> 12:19.560
Thank you.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.240
It feels like Darren's
sixth birthday party.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.920
He wouldn't let me
open them either.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.120
[Rustling]

12:28.840 --> 12:29.840
It's my fridge.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.720
It's a very premature
fridge, den.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.360
It's my fridge!

12:33.520 --> 12:36.760
Hey! I'll open these bits.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.280
Oh, that is lovely!

12:48.440 --> 12:51.320
Um... where are
we going to put it?

12:55.760 --> 12:58.640
Oh, that's fantastic!
That fits perfectly!

12:58.800 --> 13:00.680
It's completely flush
with the drugs trolley.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.400
- Well, I never.
- [Mobile ringing]

13:02.560 --> 13:04.496
- Look, I've got to go.
- Look after yourself, then.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.136
All right, then. See you,
Kim. Have a good day.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.640
Yeah, well, I would, except
I've given up smoking,

13:08.800 --> 13:10.896
so I'm not in a bloody great
mood, to be honest with you.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.480
Oh, bloody hell.
Good luck with that!

13:12.640 --> 13:14.120
- Yeah, thanks, mate.
- See you later.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.280
See you later.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.720
Oh, look, Kim, look!

13:16.880 --> 13:20.040
It's got an interior
light, it's got a drip tray,

13:20.200 --> 13:23.840
it's got an egg thing,
it's got a salad crisper.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.680
That'll make it a fridge
then, den. Excuse me.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.080
Ah, is that the fridge for
mrs dingsdale's fragmin?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.880
Er, no, it's the one
for den's breast milk.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.376
Pippa: Oh! And the health service
have paid for that, have they?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.000
It's brilliant, isn't it?

13:37.160 --> 13:39.600
As long as she only uses
it for breast milk, I suppose.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.360
Do you hear that, den?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.801
You'll have to drink your
tennent's super warm from now on.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.440
Ah! Hansley! Oh, sorry, I
don't want to tread on your...

13:57.600 --> 13:59.920
Oh, no, it's okay,
please, don't worry.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.720
About, um... oh, sorry! Lord, I'm
messing this up awfully, aren't I?

14:02.800 --> 14:04.400
No, it's okay. It's fine.

14:04.560 --> 14:08.720
I just, er... about this Norris
add-back at tomorrow's fdr.

14:08.880 --> 14:13.560
Um, I've been thinking, this French
piece that Philip's taken up with,

14:13.720 --> 14:17.280
I just don't trust her. Have
we covered all our bases?

14:17.440 --> 14:20.720
- Er... please. Sit down.
- Oh, er, thank you.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.720
Has your solicitor flagged
up white versus white?

14:24.880 --> 14:26.000
No. Should she have?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.800
In determining ancillary
relief for the spouse,

14:28.960 --> 14:30.720
there is no determined
order of priority

14:30.880 --> 14:33.600
and the distribution of
assets depends on every case.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.480
- But that could drag on for years.
- Costing you millions.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.360
Well, we don't exactly
have millions, but...

14:38.480 --> 14:40.200
The only winners
are the lawyers.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.920
Lord. So what would you advise?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.120
Minton versus minton.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.720
Right. Minton versus minton.

14:49.880 --> 14:50.720
- Right.
- Okay.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.280
Thank you.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.280
I'm sorry. I...

14:58.680 --> 14:59.680
[Door opens]

15:07.360 --> 15:09.280
Oh, no, thanks, I've given up.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.560
I just come here for the view.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.760
[Mobile ringing]

15:14.920 --> 15:16.040
Oh, excuse me.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.680
Hello?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.960
She's what, Dave?

15:49.880 --> 15:52.320
Shit.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.640
No. Well, I mean, if they're
not going to admit her...

15:55.800 --> 15:58.320
Yeah, we're just going
to have to find the space.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.360
No. Really shitty.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.240
The patches are useless.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.600
All right. I'll talk to
you later. Cheers.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.880
[Exhales]

16:15.440 --> 16:17.880
Kim: He's got vijay's nose.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.600
And hilary's fat arse.

16:19.760 --> 16:20.880
Oh, come on, Kim!

16:21.040 --> 16:22.280
It's only a joke!

16:22.440 --> 16:23.920
I'm just trying to
cheer you up. Okay?

16:24.040 --> 16:25.520
I don't need cheering up, Kim.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.600
- You're the one who needs cheering up.
- Me?

16:27.760 --> 16:30.280
Yeah. You've been a real
grump since you gave up the fags.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.400
Well, it's not just the
fags, den. It's Dave's mum.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.160
They're going to
discharge her, right?

16:35.320 --> 16:38.000
As you know, we've got
no room at home at all,

16:38.160 --> 16:41.200
so I'm sorry, but you're going to
have to move out for a few days.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.680
Look, I'm not doing it
to be nasty, all right?

16:45.840 --> 16:48.680
No, I understand that, Kim, I can
see you're not doing it to be nasty.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.640
[Sniffles]

16:51.800 --> 16:54.200
- Have you done that enema yet?
- It's lunch in 20 minutes!

16:54.360 --> 16:56.136
Well, then, that gives
you 20 minutes, doesn't it?

16:56.160 --> 16:57.280
Oh, okay

16:59.240 --> 17:01.720
eyes down for a
full house, mrs Ellis.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.120
-Morning, Denise. How are you?
-Oh! Hi.

17:11.280 --> 17:17.200
So, listen, would it be possible to
move mrs dingsdale to a private room?

17:17.360 --> 17:22.760
I've had a call from her son, and he's
a bit unhappy with the accommodation.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.520
- Normally, it would really be fine...
- Tom!

17:25.680 --> 17:27.640
- Hello, there! How are you?
- Pippa!

17:27.800 --> 17:28.800
Fantastic to see you.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.040
- Mwah!
- Mwah!

17:30.200 --> 17:31.296
To what do we owe the pleasure?

17:31.320 --> 17:33.240
Just had a meeting
with mr loftus.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.600
- I was just rebriefing him.
- Ah, yes.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.960
Yes, provision of services. I
hope we're passing muster.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.120
- We're getting there.
- Oh, good. Good.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.800
But I was actually just trying to
sort out this private referral of mine.

17:43.960 --> 17:48.440
Ah, yes. I had Benedict's
secretary on the phone, actually.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.320
Den, sorry, before
you disappear,

17:50.480 --> 17:53.840
I've had a call from professor
portnoy-noor's secretary about

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
our private lady. What's the
status on that at the moment?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.280
Well, I've only
got one side ward,

17:59.440 --> 18:03.960
and unfortunately it has got a
patient in there with a stage 13 coma.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.280
So...

18:05.440 --> 18:07.240
Right, I see.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.840
Is that patient a
private patient?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.680
Priority, but not private.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.320
- Not private.
- Denise: No, not...

18:14.480 --> 18:16.680
- Hmm.
- Tom: So...

18:16.840 --> 18:20.160
Shouldn't she be
in itu anyway, really?

18:20.320 --> 18:22.640
I think they're a bit
stacked up up there as well.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.800
Pippa: Well, um...

18:23.880 --> 18:25.040
So...

18:26.440 --> 18:28.800
We'll leave that
with the sister.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.640
Okay. Yes. I'll make
some enquiries.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.880
I have great faith in her
to make the right decision.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.280
Jolly good. Do you
want to grab a coffee, or...

18:35.440 --> 18:37.240
- You read my mind.
- [Both laughing]

18:37.400 --> 18:39.360
Pippa: Lovely.
How is Tania doing?

18:39.520 --> 18:40.936
- Tom: Tania's very well.
- Pippa: Yes.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.696
- Tom: Just incredibly busy.
- Pippa: Is she?

18:42.720 --> 18:44.040
Tom: Yeah.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.440
Shit.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.960
[Keys clacking]

19:13.000 --> 19:14.760
- Kim: Den?
- Hmm?

19:14.920 --> 19:16.720
I'm sorry about earlier.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.000
You know, I think it
probably was the fags.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.960
And Dave's mum's
going to be a nightmare.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.480
It's okay. Honestly, don't
worry about it, Kim, it's fine.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.480
[Door opens]

19:28.640 --> 19:29.840
Kim!

19:30.000 --> 19:32.040
- Yeah?
- Can you keep a secret?

19:32.200 --> 19:33.960
- Come here.
- Kim: Of course I can.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.440
You've got to keep this
totally in confidence, right?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.960
- Ooh, how exciting! Yeah.
- It's about hilary.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.280
Is it his baby?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.800
No, no. It's serious.

19:42.960 --> 19:47.160
He has asked me to make
some recommendations.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.440
- Oh.
- About the staff cuts.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.880
Right. Look, den, I honestly
haven't got any space at home.

19:53.040 --> 19:56.120
- If I did...
- Kim, I wouldn't use that.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.680
Why would I use
something like that?

19:57.720 --> 20:00.120
I wouldn't do that just to
get back into your house.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.640
You might. All
right, I'm kidding.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.360
It's serious, this, Kim.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.120
Jobs are at risk here.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.640
But you know you're leaving
anyway to have a baby, aren't you?

20:10.800 --> 20:12.760
Yeah, but... No, no,
no, my job's protected.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.800
No, it's you, Kim. I'm going to
do my best to look out for you.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.720
Yeah?

20:20.160 --> 20:23.120
Well... okay.
Thanks. Thanks, den.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.720
[Inaudible]

20:52.560 --> 20:55.120
Um, I've just been reading
your essay, kimberley.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.280
Only weird people
call me kimberley.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.800
Oh. Well, I hope you don't mind. I just
thought, as I am your mentor, I could...

21:00.960 --> 21:03.200
Well, I do mind a bit.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.240
Okay. Okay, Kim.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.960
Well, um, it starts
off really well.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.760
It's fluent and articulate and it
makes some very pertinent points.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.640
Um, but then, halfway
through, it kind of...

21:18.800 --> 21:20.960
It kind of turns into
something completely different.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.320
Good or bad?

21:23.040 --> 21:24.200
Well...

21:25.360 --> 21:27.360
I don't like to use
negative words

21:27.520 --> 21:31.200
like "clumsy" or
"adolescent", but...

21:31.360 --> 21:33.280
It's clumsy and adolescent?

21:33.440 --> 21:38.640
It just kind of loses the
essence of academic analysis.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.120
If you see what I mean.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.520
Why don't we see if we
can turn this into a positive?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.280
I'd rather have a prolapse.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.440
I just want to maximise
my job as mentor

21:49.600 --> 21:51.560
and give you the best
opportunities as mentee.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.656
So why don't we just have a look at it
right now? I'll just grab a chair, okay?

21:54.680 --> 21:55.760
Okay.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.480
Right.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.160
Quails' eggs and
asparagus not to your taste?

22:11.320 --> 22:13.840
- It was horrible!
- Oh, sorry.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.800
Do you think there's any chance
that they can find me a private room?

22:17.960 --> 22:21.680
- Kim: I'm sorry, I don't think they will.
- I'm sure we can do that.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.680
- I'm sure we can.
- Excuse me.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.976
I'll see if I can push the envelope
of care just a bit further for you.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.960
Den! Den!

22:28.120 --> 22:31.200
Damaris says she's going to
give mrs dingsdale a private room.

22:34.760 --> 22:36.520
Sorry. Matron.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.240
- Sorry, I just wanted a quick word.
- Right.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.440
Yes, Kim says that you're
thinking of moving mrs dingsdale

22:43.600 --> 22:46.120
- into the side room.
- Yes, yes.

22:46.280 --> 22:50.680
The thing is, I've had to use
that room sometimes, you know,

22:50.840 --> 22:54.200
to catch up on admin
and paperwork overload.

22:54.360 --> 22:58.440
I mean, it's very, very difficult
to work out here with the noise...

22:58.600 --> 23:01.880
Right. I'm going to have to
overrule you on this one. Sorry.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.560
Even though I'm pregnant?

23:04.720 --> 23:09.240
I'm terribly sorry, den, but you know
our priority is enhancing care pathways

23:09.400 --> 23:12.160
for all of our patients,
including our private guests, so...

23:12.320 --> 23:15.080
- Yeah, I just need the room.
- Yes, but so does she.

23:19.520 --> 23:23.800
I don't know who Damaris thinks
she is. I mean, I really need my office.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.360
What are you going to do?

23:25.520 --> 23:27.320
Well, hilary's all over me.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.120
Maybe I could get rid of her.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.920
I mean, I'd lose my mentor,
but I suppose it'd be worth it.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.320
I think it'd be better for you,
Kim. It would keep your job secure.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.800
Well, that would be amazing,
den, 'cause I'd really owe you one.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.440
I mean, like, a small one.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.520
- Not a big one, like moving in...
- I know, Kim.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.920
Don't worry. I'm not
going to exploit you.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.400
I know you're under a lot of
stress with your mother-in-law.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.960
Den, honestly, if I thought I could
help, you know I would, don't you?

23:52.120 --> 23:53.200
Yeah.

24:02.840 --> 24:06.560
Den, any joy with
mrs Ellis' microlax?

24:06.720 --> 24:09.640
Sorry, no, I don't think so. I
think the enema was unsuccessful.

24:09.800 --> 24:13.440
Ah. Okay. I think perhaps we'd better
move straight to manual evacuation, then.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.640
- Fight you for it.
- Oh, thanks, Kim.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.000
Jolly good. Do you
want to get consent?

24:18.160 --> 24:19.256
Pippa: Great. Thank
you very much.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.680
Kim: Could I just
have a quick word?

24:20.840 --> 24:23.000
- Just very quickly.
- I want to ask you a favour.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.920
- Er...
- My mother-in-law had a fall

24:25.080 --> 24:28.080
and broke her arm and she
went to a&amp;E at st Luke's,

24:28.240 --> 24:29.600
but they're not
going to admit her,

24:29.680 --> 24:32.280
and Dave and I can't
really cope with her at home,

24:32.440 --> 24:35.920
so I just wondered if I could ask
you if you'd mind phoning st Luke's,

24:36.080 --> 24:39.600
if you know a consultant there,
and seeing if he could keep...

24:39.760 --> 24:42.560
Nurse, while I understand
your difficulties, er...

24:42.720 --> 24:44.720
I doubt it.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.000
Well, I just can't call in too many
favours with st Luke's, you know.

24:48.160 --> 24:51.400
And it may be that the best place
for her is in the home environment.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.160
- Oh, just forget it, okay?
- Righto!

25:00.240 --> 25:02.880
- All right.
- Oh, I'm sorry about that, den.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.840
- Oh, it's okay.
- She wouldn't even listen.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.080
I mean, I could maybe put you
top-to-toe on one of the bunk beds

25:10.240 --> 25:11.840
with one of the twins.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.880
Yeah... Do you think it's worth
me having a word with her?

25:15.040 --> 25:16.560
You won't get anywhere.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.080
Pippa: Ah, den, I've just
had Benedict on the phone.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.720
He's pretty keen to sort
out this private patient.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.360
- Have we got any news on that?
- I've got that all in process.

25:24.400 --> 25:28.040
Oh, great! Okay. Thank you. I'll let
Tom and Benedict know. Thank you.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.480
- Dr Moore, just...
- Yes?

25:29.640 --> 25:31.320
Sorry, um...

25:31.480 --> 25:33.560
Den: I just wanted
to say sorry, actually,

25:33.720 --> 25:36.280
because I have been very
irritable today. I know that.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.680
Er... we've all been
a bit, probably...

25:38.840 --> 25:42.840
The thing is, I'm picking up on Kim's
stress, because she's given up smoking,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.800
but this thing with
her mother-in-law...

25:44.960 --> 25:46.000
Right.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.920
It's really getting her down.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.240
You couldn't just have a word with
someone at st Luke's, could you?

25:51.400 --> 25:54.280
I'm sorry, I've already made
that very clear to nurse wilde.

25:54.440 --> 25:57.120
I'm not prepared to
call in favours for staff.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.440
Just on this occasion?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.400
I'm surprised at you
asking me, rather, den.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.200
It's frankly
unethical. So, yes...

26:03.360 --> 26:04.760
No is the answer to that.

26:04.920 --> 26:09.080
Dr Moore... I just want to
give you a warning, actually.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.560
It's about Tom.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.440
Dr kersley?

26:12.600 --> 26:17.240
Yeah. Well, I had a
relationship with Tom.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.520
It was about five years ago
and it wasn't really a relationship,

26:20.680 --> 26:23.160
I suppose, it was
more of one night.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.840
It wasn't quite
one night, but...

26:25.000 --> 26:26.976
- It was just...
- Sorry, why are you telling me this?

26:27.000 --> 26:32.320
I just wanted to...
I've just heard things.

26:32.480 --> 26:36.120
Apparently, these
days he'll shag anything.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.000
I just wanted to let
you know, as a favour.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.160
In what way is that a favour?

26:41.880 --> 26:43.240
Well, it...

26:49.000 --> 26:51.200
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.040
I'm really... Yeah, thank
you so much. Yeah.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.760
I'll see you in
chatters, yeah. Thanks.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.920
Are you not catching
the five to five?

27:07.080 --> 27:09.080
Oh, just if I hurry, actually.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.800
Not been a great day, has it?

27:13.960 --> 27:15.440
I don't know. You've
given up smoking.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.680
- That's a good thing.
- Yeah, you got a fridge.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.680
Yeah, that's a very good thing.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.480
- Den?
- Hmm?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.480
Look, I've had a thought, right.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.296
Me and Dave have got a big wardrobe
with a sliding door in our bedroom.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.601
I could put a little mattress
in it, and you could shut...

27:28.680 --> 27:30.520
Look, Kim, honestly,
I've sorted something out.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.760
I've got an encore room,
just for tonight. You know?

27:32.920 --> 27:34.160
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.760
Have you sorted
out mrs dingsdale?

27:35.920 --> 27:37.200
Yeah. Yeah.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.400
Den. You promised dr Moore.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.080
I have! No, I have. Popocatepetl
have got a sepsis in their side ward.

27:43.240 --> 27:46.720
She's been on high dependency.
She's come back. She's much better.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.840
They're putting her
onto the main ward,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.256
and I can get mrs dingsdale into
their side ward just for a couple of days.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.680
That's all she needs.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.896
You couldn't get Dave's mum
in there and all, could you?

27:54.920 --> 27:56.840
- No.
- [Chuckling] We can try.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.216
- All right. Listen, are you coming with me?
- No, no, quick, go, honestly,

27:59.240 --> 28:01.416
- I've got to stay with amma.
- All right, I'll see you. Bye.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.360
- Need to hand over, you know.
- Okay.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.760
