00:05.503 --> 00:09.149
<b>1x15 - Reboot</b>

00:22.017 --> 00:24.356
<i>Previously on "Green Lantern"... </i>

00:24.423 --> 00:26.425
<i>The Manhunters.</i>

00:26.493 --> 00:29.433
<i>Their prime directive was to hunt
and destroy the criminal element.</i>

00:29.501 --> 00:32.869
<i>Somehow, they decided that included
all life forms with emotions.</i>

00:32.936 --> 00:34.871
Congratulations, Hal Jordan.

00:34.940 --> 00:38.881
You have been promoted to Honor
Guard of the Green Lantern corps.

00:40.183 --> 00:42.518
Now that we have
completed a week of work,

00:42.586 --> 00:45.420
what do you think of Honor
Guard duty so far, Hal Jordan?

00:45.488 --> 00:48.290
It's an honor, Tomar.
Can I call you Tomar?

00:48.357 --> 00:52.363
- I prefer Tomar-Re.
- Of course you do.

01:00.074 --> 01:02.375
I requested your help on
this mission, Hal Jordan,

01:02.444 --> 01:04.378
because of your experience in this area.

01:04.446 --> 01:06.747
Looks like the Manhunter
temple I saw on Earth.

01:06.814 --> 01:10.216
Do you think there's a sleeper cell like
this on every planet in every sector?

01:10.283 --> 01:13.518
If so, we would have a universe-wide
catastrophe on our hands.

01:13.586 --> 01:16.555
There's not much we can learn
from here. Let's go inside.

01:16.623 --> 01:19.259
I believe the proper
procedure is to call the Council,

01:19.326 --> 01:22.296
inform them of our plans,
then await permission.

01:22.364 --> 01:23.932
There's an old saying on Earth...

01:24.000 --> 01:25.767
sometimes, it's better
to apologize later

01:25.835 --> 01:28.404
than to ask permission first.

01:33.445 --> 01:35.580
You can use that.

01:44.025 --> 01:46.159
[beeping]

01:57.541 --> 02:02.246
Three of them, just like on Earth.
That must be the standard contingent.

02:04.283 --> 02:06.518
The Guardians made these things, right?

02:06.585 --> 02:09.221
You don't think that they had something
to do with turning them back on?

02:09.288 --> 02:11.424
No, and my research has not shown

02:11.493 --> 02:13.928
a master communications
signal of any kind,

02:13.995 --> 02:15.963
<i>not even on subsonic frequencies.</i>

02:16.031 --> 02:19.067
- Really?
- I am very thorough.

02:19.135 --> 02:22.271
Well, at least these 3 are offline.

02:22.339 --> 02:24.541
Or maybe not.

02:26.911 --> 02:28.445
[clicks]

02:30.682 --> 02:32.817
[both grunt]

02:48.269 --> 02:51.004
- You go low. I'll go high.
- Understood.

03:01.417 --> 03:04.453
[grunts]

03:07.758 --> 03:10.193
Nicely executed, Hal Jordan.

03:14.032 --> 03:16.567
Did I mention I hate these things?

03:27.078 --> 03:29.746
That won't hold them 
for long. Let's go.

03:47.801 --> 03:50.670
If there are multiple
Manhunters for every temple,

03:50.737 --> 03:53.473
we may be in more trouble
than I initially surmised.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.775
This problem's way
bigger than the two of us.

03:55.843 --> 03:58.845
Let's consult the Guardians.

03:58.912 --> 04:03.049
<i>It is a fact.
After the great Manhunter incident,</i>

04:03.116 --> 04:05.718
the robots were all
deactivated and vanished.

04:05.786 --> 04:08.521
They are not scattered 
about the galaxy.

04:08.588 --> 04:14.126
The science branch has found no
evidence to substantiate your hunch

04:14.194 --> 04:17.028
that these Manhunter
appearances are anything more

04:17.096 --> 04:20.464
- than isolated incidents.
- Look, my gut tells me

04:20.533 --> 04:22.734
that there's an outside
force orchestrating this.

04:22.802 --> 04:25.036
We need to assemble
as many GLs as we can

04:25.104 --> 04:28.540
and find the puppetmaster.
Tomar-Re will back me up.

04:28.607 --> 04:31.443
I hate to disagree with
Hal Jordan's digestive juices,

04:31.510 --> 04:33.878
but I have found no controlling signal.

04:33.946 --> 04:38.650
However, the Manhunter reactivation
is real and must be investigated.

04:38.718 --> 04:41.887
In deference to his
new status as Honor Guard,

04:41.954 --> 04:45.324
perhaps we could allow Hal
Jordan to assemble a small team

04:45.392 --> 04:48.060
to map the Manhunter
structures in Guardian space.

04:48.128 --> 04:51.663
I won't let you down.
But I do have one small request.

04:51.731 --> 04:53.332
I'm going to need to
cover a lot of ground

04:53.399 --> 04:58.604
in a very short amount of
time, so... I'll need my ship.

04:58.672 --> 05:02.609
Your ship?
Very well.

05:02.676 --> 05:05.945
The "Interceptor" will
be made available to you.

05:06.013 --> 05:10.451
Yes!
I mean, yes, sir.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.853
<i>Was that a construct,
or did your ring backfire?</i>

05:12.921 --> 05:14.488
You're training to be Green Lanterns,

05:14.556 --> 05:17.158
not members of the
Guardian Council choir!

05:17.225 --> 05:19.961
I've seen a hundred-year-old
queezilbug with broken legs

05:20.028 --> 05:22.596
climb that obstacle
faster than your posers!

05:22.664 --> 05:23.798
Do you hear me?

05:23.865 --> 05:25.433
<i>Sir, yes, sir!</i>

05:25.500 --> 05:28.602
<i>I forgot how precious you
are in your natural habitat.</i>

05:28.670 --> 05:31.872
Jordan? I thought you
were on Honor Guard duty.

05:31.940 --> 05:35.776
I am, but now, I have orders to
get the band back together. Want in?

05:35.843 --> 05:39.046
After you dragged me to frontier
space, and I got stuck fighting

05:39.113 --> 05:41.614
the whole Red Lantern
invasion by myself?

05:41.682 --> 05:44.684
As fun as that was, I'll pass.

05:44.752 --> 05:49.288
- What? This is a shot at real action.
- I'm happy here.

05:49.356 --> 05:51.691
Molding, guiding, and
nurturing young recruits

05:51.758 --> 05:55.828
so they realize their potential.
In a way, they're like my children.

05:55.895 --> 05:59.131
You useless, stumbling
piece of stinkin' oonsplat!

05:59.198 --> 06:03.635
You go over, not under!
Do it again!

06:03.703 --> 06:06.671
Where's the challenge here?
How about a little wager?

06:06.739 --> 06:08.306
I'll take on your best recruit,

06:08.373 --> 06:10.307
and if I kick his butt,
you have to come with me.

06:10.375 --> 06:13.910
- And if he kicks yours?
- [scoffs] Like that's going to happen.

06:13.978 --> 06:17.350
Sector recruit 1014!

06:21.227 --> 06:22.919
[chitters]

06:26.057 --> 06:30.060
Now, remember,
just like I taught you. Attack!

06:30.127 --> 06:32.295
[grunting]

06:51.348 --> 06:52.882
Get it off!
 [grunts]

06:52.950 --> 06:55.184
No mas! No mas!

06:55.252 --> 06:56.653
[chuckles]

06:56.720 --> 06:58.754
Ok. I think he's had enough.

06:58.822 --> 07:01.423
[groaning]

07:05.962 --> 07:07.095
[chitters]

07:07.163 --> 07:11.866
- How did that happen?
- [laughs] That was rich!

07:11.934 --> 07:14.468
Ok. I'll get my gear and
meet you on the "Interceptor."

07:14.536 --> 07:16.437
But I lost the bet.

07:16.505 --> 07:18.473
I was going to go with you anyway.

07:18.541 --> 07:23.612
I just wanted to see you
fight the squirrel. Ahh, loser.

07:27.985 --> 07:30.987
Hey, Aya. We're back. 
Let's get going.

07:31.054 --> 07:32.756
Did you miss us?

07:32.823 --> 07:34.724
Aya? Hello?

07:34.792 --> 07:37.560
<i>Aya is no longer
installed on this vessel.</i>

07:37.628 --> 07:41.397
<i>I am Lanos, the lightspeed astronomical
navigation operating system.</i>

07:41.465 --> 07:44.901
- Lanos?
- More like Lameo.

07:46.671 --> 07:49.172
[both grunting]

07:52.242 --> 07:54.844
Shut that thing off
before it hits someone!

07:54.912 --> 07:56.913
[grunts]

07:56.980 --> 07:59.082
<i>Guardian spacecraft
regulations require me</i>

07:59.149 --> 08:01.885
<i>to be operational at all times.</i>

08:09.094 --> 08:11.295
[grunting]

08:11.363 --> 08:14.733
Very smooth, Lameo. 
You got a real light touch.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.434
We've got to find Aya.

08:16.502 --> 08:18.770
<i>Aya is no longer
installed on this vessel.</i>

08:18.838 --> 08:20.372
<i>I am Lanos, the lightspeed...</i>

08:20.439 --> 08:24.042
I got that the first time. 
Find Aya, now!

08:24.110 --> 08:27.045
<i>Accessing.</i>

08:27.113 --> 08:28.346
[gasps]

08:28.914 --> 08:32.884
Hey. Hey!
What are they doing to her?

08:32.952 --> 08:37.255
<i>Research subject Aya scheduled
for dissection in 2.3 hours.</i>

08:47.145 --> 08:50.648
- What are you doing?
- Maneuvering per your request. 

08:50.715 --> 08:52.183
When I said "most direct route,"

08:52.250 --> 08:54.585
I didn't mean go through
a building to get there!

08:54.653 --> 08:57.588
Just set us down right
next to the science branch

08:57.656 --> 08:59.824
without hitting anything else.

08:59.892 --> 09:02.360
<i>Complying with your request.</i>

09:08.434 --> 09:10.702
["Interceptor" approaching]

09:22.080 --> 09:25.082
[groans]

09:25.150 --> 09:28.719
Now what? 
We can't just go in shooting.

09:31.390 --> 09:35.627
<i>Hal Jordan, accessing my datacore
will result in my disconnection.</i>

09:35.695 --> 09:38.029
<i>I advise that you stop.</i>

09:40.600 --> 09:44.102
No worries. 
I have a plan.

09:47.188 --> 09:51.744
Sector recruit 017.
How are you today, Larvox?

09:52.812 --> 09:56.715
This isn't a social call, poser.
It's a surprise inspection.

09:56.783 --> 09:59.184
Are you getting sloppy?
Show me your log records!

09:59.252 --> 10:01.286
<i>Now! Right now!</i>

10:07.159 --> 10:10.729
In case you can't tell,
 I'm not happy!

10:31.319 --> 10:35.123
Hang on, Aya.
I'll get you out.

10:51.741 --> 10:53.843
- What is going on here?
- Aah!

10:53.911 --> 10:57.881
Hey. Hi. I'm checking the power
couplings in all the lab stations.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.250
You must be lab security?

11:00.317 --> 11:04.754
Yes. I am Green Lantern 
Chaselon. You are?

11:04.822 --> 11:07.757
Green Lantern...
Sir Jets-a-lot.

11:07.825 --> 11:10.393
It's nice to meet
a new face around Oa.

11:12.696 --> 11:13.763
[clinks]

11:13.831 --> 11:14.998
Did you hear something?

11:15.065 --> 11:17.734
No, no. 
Say, I've always wondered,

11:17.802 --> 11:20.970
how do you beings keep
your facets so shiny?

11:21.038 --> 11:24.941
You think? Mom always
said I was the dullest.

11:43.361 --> 11:46.430
So really, as a condition
of my crystallized structure,

11:46.498 --> 11:47.965
I remain dirt-free.

11:50.969 --> 11:54.238
Oddly, few other Green
Lanterns are interested in this.

11:55.707 --> 11:57.975
Their loss. Tell me more.

12:13.223 --> 12:15.991
Is there something
wrong with your limb?

12:16.059 --> 12:18.961
Huh? Oh, this?
I have Lantern elbow

12:19.029 --> 12:21.864
from overcharging my
ring a few too many times.

12:21.931 --> 12:23.298
Your species have any 
problem with that?

12:23.366 --> 12:27.502
No. My arms are non-organic.
I do, however, get silica mites.

12:27.570 --> 12:29.337
Fascinating.

12:29.405 --> 12:31.038
Perhaps we could consume
refreshment together

12:31.106 --> 12:34.943
and speak of our adventures.
I have so few friends.

12:35.010 --> 12:36.711
Sounds great, buddy. 
Maybe next week?

12:36.779 --> 12:38.813
Right now, I got loads
of couplings to check.

12:38.881 --> 12:42.717
- Good talk.
- Bye!

12:42.785 --> 12:46.888
- Who was that?
- That was Green Lantern Sir Jets-a-lot.

12:46.956 --> 12:50.392
He was kind enough to check
our coupling assemblies.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.061
See to it I'm not disturbed.

12:53.129 --> 12:57.032
I want to end this Aya
experiment once and for all.

12:57.099 --> 13:00.702
<i>But I am not Aya. 
I am Lanos.</i>

13:00.770 --> 13:05.207
Silence. I can see straight through
your ploy of self-preservation.

13:05.274 --> 13:07.509
<i>But I am not Aya. I am Lanos.</i>

13:07.577 --> 13:11.913
Sloppy. Incomplete. Careless.

13:14.650 --> 13:17.918
So, uh, get your act together.

13:28.430 --> 13:30.798
Hey, 1014.

13:34.069 --> 13:35.836
Nice work.

13:43.946 --> 13:45.780
We must speak, Hal Jordan.

13:45.847 --> 13:48.749
[sighs] Busted. 
Look, I can explain.

13:48.817 --> 13:50.551
No, I must explain.

13:50.619 --> 13:53.921
You were correct about a signal
activating the Manhunters.

14:03.499 --> 14:06.068
<i>Thank you for coming to my
assistance, Green Lanterns.</i>

14:06.136 --> 14:07.770
Aya, you're ok!

14:07.838 --> 14:11.106
I am operating at full capacity,
thanks to you.

14:11.174 --> 14:15.611
Nice to have you back, Aya.
That Lameo was getting on my nerves.

14:15.678 --> 14:18.580
Sorry we had to
leave your body behind.

14:18.648 --> 14:22.250
- Where's Razer?
- He's... on Sabbatical.

14:22.318 --> 14:24.620
I'm sure he'll show up... 
eventually.

14:24.687 --> 14:26.222
Oh.

14:26.289 --> 14:28.491
I was at the science
branch researching your theory

14:28.558 --> 14:30.659
about various communication signals.

14:30.727 --> 14:33.161
I discovered a low-level
antimatter pulse,

14:33.229 --> 14:37.132
almost undetectable.
It may be activating the Manhunters.

14:37.199 --> 14:40.467
I knew it. And you asked the
Guardians if you could check this out?

14:40.535 --> 14:43.471
Well, no. 
But sometimes, Hal Jordan,

14:43.538 --> 14:47.174
it is better to apologize later
than to ask permission first.

14:47.241 --> 14:49.075
You don't say.

14:49.143 --> 14:51.477
Triangulating the signal
of known Manhunter temples,

14:51.545 --> 14:56.048
I located its source...
the planet Biot.

15:15.435 --> 15:21.406
I don't like the look of this place.
Some kind of super junkyard.

15:21.474 --> 15:25.077
Worse... we've stumbled
into the Manhunter graveyard.

15:27.780 --> 15:29.814
[beeping]

15:29.882 --> 15:34.419
Wait. I've just detected 
a low-level antimatter pulse.

15:36.756 --> 15:39.991
[creaking and crashing]

15:40.059 --> 15:42.093
Now, the fun starts.

15:47.059 --> 15:49.894
No man escapes the Manhunters. 

15:49.962 --> 15:52.931
<i>[overlapping] No man
escapes the Manhunters.</i>

15:52.999 --> 15:55.734
<i>No man escapes the Manhunters.</i>

15:56.970 --> 16:01.373
- No man escapes the Manhunters.
- Sorry. What were you saying?

16:03.243 --> 16:05.477
Let's create some personal space!

16:17.957 --> 16:20.091
[grunting]

16:27.167 --> 16:30.003
You still got it, Tomar-Re.

16:34.508 --> 16:36.710
[grunting]

16:37.677 --> 16:40.547
That building.
Get there and set up a perimeter.

16:40.615 --> 16:43.750
- On the move. Jordan, cover our rear.
- I'm on it.

16:59.667 --> 17:03.870
<i>No man escapes the Manhunt...</i>

17:05.306 --> 17:09.277
- What is this place?
- It's some sort of bunker,

17:09.344 --> 17:12.146
<i>a lot like the one Tomar-Re
and I found in our sectors.</i>

17:12.214 --> 17:14.215
<i>But bigger.</i>

17:15.318 --> 17:17.837
According to my measurements,
I can approximately trace

17:17.838 --> 17:20.356
the source of the antimatter
pulse to this structure.

17:20.424 --> 17:23.492
[clicking and buzzing]

17:44.649 --> 17:48.018
It's a factory.
They're all factories.

17:48.086 --> 17:49.954
That explains where those
extra Manhunters came from

17:50.021 --> 17:53.190
when we were on patrol.
This is way worse than we thought.

17:53.258 --> 17:56.627
Yes. The facility was
activated by the antimatter pulse.

17:56.695 --> 17:58.896
Our arrival was coincidental.

18:05.804 --> 18:07.804
Uh-oh.

18:24.220 --> 18:25.854
Aya, we have to abort the mission.

18:25.921 --> 18:30.191
<i>Target our location with the
"Interceptor's" weapons array.</i>

18:30.258 --> 18:34.428
<i>Targeting. Weapons will be
online in approximately 10 seconds.</i>

18:37.099 --> 18:38.833
We could use it now.

18:40.401 --> 18:44.104
<i>Weapons array online.
Targeting solution computed.</i>

18:44.171 --> 18:47.908
<i>Firing in 3, 2, 1.</i>

18:49.477 --> 18:51.678
[rumbling]

18:59.153 --> 19:02.289
<i>Green Lantern Hal, 
what is your status?</i>

19:02.357 --> 19:04.859
<i>Sergeant Kilowog? 
Tomar-Re?</i>

19:08.730 --> 19:11.232
We're safe, Aya. Nice shooting.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.968
Odd. I'm still detecting an...

19:14.036 --> 19:16.204
[rumbling and crashing]

19:27.717 --> 19:30.419
<i>Alone, I have conquered
an entire universe</i>

19:30.487 --> 19:33.289
<i>and reduced trillions
of planets to antimatter,</i>

19:33.356 --> 19:39.462
<i>feasting on each one by one.
But still, I hunger.</i>

19:39.529 --> 19:43.499
<i>These factories are scattered
to the far regions of your space.</i>

19:43.567 --> 19:46.535
<i>once activated, an
army of Manhunter slaves</i>

19:46.603 --> 19:49.205
<i>will aid me in my
mission of destruction.</i>

19:49.272 --> 19:52.974
<i>You will merely be
 the first I consume.</i>

20:09.424 --> 20:12.359
Aya, target the big guy 
with another full-power blast,

20:12.426 --> 20:13.960
just like you did on the temple.

20:14.028 --> 20:16.463
<i>I am on it.</i>

20:26.373 --> 20:27.473
Yes!

20:27.541 --> 20:29.275
[rumbles]

20:44.624 --> 20:46.792
<i>You will all be consumed.</i>

20:53.099 --> 20:54.799
[grunts]

20:56.402 --> 20:58.069
Move, Aya, now!

21:03.074 --> 21:05.075
No, Jordan! 
Get out of there!

21:05.143 --> 21:07.210
[grunting]

21:10.948 --> 21:12.281
Hal!

21:12.349 --> 21:14.917
[grunts]

21:19.789 --> 21:23.493
He's... gone.

21:27.563 --> 21:30.319
<i>To be continued...</i>
