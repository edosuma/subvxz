00:02.520 --> 00:05.876
My parents live in Florida now.
They moved there last year.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.679
They didn't wanna move to Florida,
but they're in their 60s...

00:08.840 --> 00:10.034
...and that's the law.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.398
And you know how it works.
They got the leisure police.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.438
They pull up in front of the
old people's house with the golf cart.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.751
"Let's go, pop. White belt, white pants,
white shoes, get in the back.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.036
Drop the snow shovel, right there.
Drop it!"

00:23.200 --> 00:25.919
I am not much
for the family gathering.

00:26.320 --> 00:29.153
You ever sit there, and the
conversation's so boring, it's so dull?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.880
And you start to fantasize.
You know, you think:

00:32.040 --> 00:36.636
"What if I just got up and jumped out
that window? I wonder what..."

00:36.800 --> 00:39.109
Just crash right through the glass,
you know.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.430
Come back. There's broken glass.
Everybody's upset.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.160
"No, I'm all right.
I was just a little bored there.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.878
And, no, I'm fine.
I came back.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.508
I wanna hear more about
that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.432
Let's pick it up right there."

00:56.520 --> 00:59.830
You have so many nice jackets. I don't
know why you had to bring this jacket.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.319
Who wears a jacket like this?

01:02.280 --> 01:04.510
What's wrong
with that nice grey one?

01:04.840 --> 01:07.035
You have beautiful clothes.
They sit in your closet.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.156
Morty, you can't wear this.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.272
- Are you getting that?
- I thought you were getting it.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.830
- Should I pick up?
- Do you want me to get that?

01:24.960 --> 01:27.190
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.599
Hello.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.352
Hello.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.952
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.669
Would you make this thing lower?

01:47.840 --> 01:51.515
- I can hear it on the street.
- Hey, Jer, how did you do?

01:51.680 --> 01:54.399
We won.
I made an incredible play in the field.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.198
It was a tag-up at third base.

01:56.360 --> 02:00.273
I threw the guy out,
from left field, on a fly.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.034
We'll be in the championship game
Wednesday because of me.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.033
It was the single greatest
moment in my life.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.633
This is your greatest moment,
a game?

02:09.759 --> 02:12.957
Well, no.
Sharon Besser, of course.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.830
You know what my greatest moment
was, don't you?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.470
In 1946, I went to work
for Harry Flemming...

02:19.640 --> 02:22.552
...and I came up with the idea
for the beltless trench coat.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.832
Jerry, look at this sport jacket.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.275
Is this a jacket to wear
to an anniversary party?

02:29.080 --> 02:32.629
Well, the man's an individualist.
He worked for Harry Flemming.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.315
- He knows what he's doing.
- But it's their 50th anniversary.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.391
Your mother doesn't like
my taste in clothing.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.870
I spoke to Manya and Isaac
on the phone today.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.031
They invited you again.
I think you should go.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.997
First of all,
I made plans with Elaine.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.878
So bring her.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.077
I don't even know them.
What is she, your second cousin?

02:50.240 --> 02:52.037
I mean, I met them
three times in my life.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.394
I don't know her either.

02:53.560 --> 02:58.031
She made me fly from Florida for this,
and then she criticizes my jacket.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.830
At least come and say hello,
have a cup of coffee, then you leave.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.592
How come he gets to leave?

03:06.160 --> 03:09.436
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo,
I am leaving.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.034
He's always grabbing my arm
when he talks to me.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.239
I guess because so many people have
left in the middle of his conversation.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.676
And it's always
about Jeffrey, right?

03:18.840 --> 03:21.912
Yeah. He talks about him
like he split the atom.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.036
The kid works for
the Parks Department.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.830
- Morty, you coming in?
- Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.116
- Hey. How'd you do?
- We won.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.555
- We're in the finals on Wednesday.
- Yeah!

03:33.720 --> 03:35.312
What is this about?

03:35.480 --> 03:37.948
I'm completely changing
the configuration of the apartment.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.953
You're not gonna believe it when
you see it. Whole new lifestyle.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.115
- What are you doing?
- Levels.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.114
- Levels.
- Yeah.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.316
I'm getting rid of all my furniture,
all of it...

03:49.480 --> 03:51.755
...and I'm gonna build
these different levels.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.433
You know, with steps.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.795
And it'll all be carpeted.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.871
With a lot of pillows.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.832
You know, like ancient Egypt.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.274
- You drew up plans for this?
- No. No, it's all in my head.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.431
I don't see how you can
get comfortable.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.272
Oh, I'll get comfortable.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.476
When do you intend to do this?

04:11.440 --> 04:13.431
Should be done
by the end of the month.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.910
- Gonna do this yourself?
- It's a simple job.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.428
- Well, you don't think I can, huh?
- No, it's not that I don't think you can.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.910
I know that you can't,
and I'm positive that you won't.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.189
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows.
All I need is the lumber.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.876
- Hey, that's some big job.
- I don't see it happening.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.791
Yeah, well, this time...
This time you're wrong.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.712
- Come on, I'll even bet you.
- Seriously?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.758
I don't want you betting.
Morty, don't let them bet.

04:42.920 --> 04:46.117
A big dinner with dessert,
but I got till the end of the month.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.074
- I'll give you a year.
- No, no.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.277
- No, no, a month. End of the month.
- It's a bet.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:02.600 --> 05:04.750
Seriously, do you wanna
switch chairs?

05:09.840 --> 05:11.751
No, no. I'm fine.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.388
Oh, Jerry, you listening to this?

05:14.560 --> 05:16.471
Yeah, Uncle Leo.

05:17.160 --> 05:22.871
So now the Parks commissioner is
recommending Jeffrey for a citation.

05:23.040 --> 05:26.077
Right, for the reducing
of the pond scum?

05:26.240 --> 05:30.199
No, no, no. For the walking tours.

05:30.360 --> 05:35.070
Oh, yeah, where the people eat
the plant life, the edible-foliage tour.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.436
That's exactly right.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.951
He knows the whole history
of the park.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.954
For two hours, he's talking
and answering questions.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.951
But you wanna know something?

05:47.120 --> 05:49.680
Whenever he has a problem
with a high-powered big shot...

05:49.840 --> 05:51.717
...from the Parks Department...

05:51.880 --> 05:53.836
...you know who he calls?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.672
Mickey Mantle?

05:55.840 --> 05:58.195
Jerry. Jerry.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.191
Did you taste these peas?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.749
These peas are great.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.356
These peas are bursting
with country-fresh flavour.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.790
Phenomenal peas.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.788
- Are you ready for dessert?
- Well...

06:14.960 --> 06:17.872
...actually, we do have
to kind of get going.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.394
You're going?

06:20.680 --> 06:24.673
- I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.
- Yeah, I can't eat dessert either.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.957
The sugar makes my ankles swell up,
and I can't dance.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.359
- Can't dance?
- He's kidding, Manya.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.397
Is that a joke?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.431
So did you hear Claire's
getting married?

06:36.600 --> 06:37.749
Yeah, yeah.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.831
I hear the fellow owns
a couple racehorses.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.355
- You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
- Horses.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.916
They're like big riding dogs.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.755
What about ponies, huh?
What kind of abnormal animal is that?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.350
And those kids who had
their own ponies.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.953
Oh, I know. I hated those kids.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.829
In fact, I hate anyone that ever had
a pony when they were growing up.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.559
I had a pony.

07:03.600 --> 07:07.832
Well, I didn't really mean
a pony per se.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.032
When I was a little girl in Poland...

07:11.200 --> 07:13.316
...we all had ponies.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.198
My sister had pony.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.112
My cousin had pony.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.953
- So, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.680
- I was just merely expressing...
- Should we have some coffee?

07:22.840 --> 07:25.115
Who's having coffee?

07:25.280 --> 07:28.636
He was a beautiful pony,
and I loved him.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.633
Well, I'm sure you did.
Who wouldn't love a pony?

07:31.960 --> 07:34.349
Who wouldn't love a person
that had a pony?

07:34.560 --> 07:36.630
You. You said so.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.030
No, see, we didn't have ponies.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.953
I'm sure at that time in Poland,
they were common. They were...

07:42.120 --> 07:43.678
...probably like compact cars.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.879
That's it.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.110
I had enough.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.119
Have your coffee, everybody.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.076
She's a little upset.
It's been an emotional day.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.519
I didn't know she had a pony.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.395
How was I to know she had a pony?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.835
Who figures an immigrant
is gonna have a pony?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.514
Do you know what
the odds are on that?

08:14.080 --> 08:16.878
I mean, in all the pictures I saw
of immigrants on boats...

08:17.040 --> 08:18.837
...coming into New York Harbour...

08:19.000 --> 08:21.070
...I never saw one of them
sitting on a pony.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.232
But why would anyone come here
if they had a pony?

08:26.400 --> 08:29.790
Who leaves a country packed with
ponies to go to a non-pony country?

08:30.880 --> 08:33.235
It doesn't make sense.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.671
Am I wrong?

08:39.760 --> 08:43.035
- I'll drive you to the airport.
- No, we're taking a cab.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.796
I just hope that whole pony incident
didn't put a damper on the trip.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.720
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
It was a misunderstanding.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.552
Hey, I agree with him.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.029
Nobody likes a kid with a pony.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.469
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm
sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.359
- You know, you should call Manya.
- Maybe I will.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.758
- Oh, hi. Hey.
- Hey.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.753
I just came to say goodbye.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.275
- Hey, need any help with those?
- It's nothing. I got it.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.670
So how are your levels
coming along?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.039
Well, I decided I'm not gonna do it.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.840
Really? What a shock.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.952
- Goodbye. We'll call you.
- Take care.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.758
- Bye, Jer.
- Bye, Dad. Take it easy.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.514
- Bye, Mr. Kramer.
- Yeah, so long, Morty.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.439
So...

09:30.720 --> 09:32.870
...when do I get my dinner?

09:33.040 --> 09:36.237
There's no dinner. The bet's off.
I'm not gonna do it.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.115
Yes, I know you're not gonna do it.
That's why I bet.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.350
Yeah, well, there's no bet
if I'm not doing it.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.512
That's the bet,
that you're not doing it.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.432
Yeah, I could do it.
I don't wanna do it.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.472
We didn't bet on
if you wanted to do it...

09:48.640 --> 09:50.073
...we bet on if it would be done.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.152
- And it could be done.
- Well, of course it could be done.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.916
Anything could be done,
but it only is done if it's done.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.559
Show me the levels.

09:59.720 --> 10:03.190
- The bet is the levels.
- I don't want the levels.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.793
That's the bet.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.159
Man.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.872
Hello.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.316
No. Oh, hi.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.831
No, they just left.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.556
Oh, my God.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.998
Hang on a second,
maybe I can still catch them.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.829
Ma. Ma, up here.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.672
Don't get in the cab.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.831
Manya died.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.560
Manya died!

10:40.480 --> 10:42.391
- Who'd you talk to?
- Uncle Leo.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.120
- And when's the funeral?
- I don't know, said he'd call back.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.474
You know what this means?

10:46.640 --> 10:50.155
We lost the supersaver.
Those tickets are nonrefundable.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.792
She just had a checkup.
The doctor said she was fine.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.874
- Unless...
- What?

10:59.360 --> 11:01.635
What? Nothing.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.479
You don't think...?

11:04.640 --> 11:05.868
What, the pony remark?

11:06.640 --> 11:09.438
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
She was an old woman.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.794
You don't think I killed her?

11:12.160 --> 11:13.798
You know what that flight
will cost us?

11:14.120 --> 11:15.792
It was an innocent comment.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.279
I didn't know she had a pony.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.990
Maybe we could get
an Army transport flight.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.355
They got a base in Sarasota, I think.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.553
I mean, the whole thing was taken
out of context. It was a joke.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.111
That's probably Uncle Leo.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.719
Hello.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.151
Yes, I know.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.269
Well, it's just one of those things.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.678
Sure, sure. We'll see you then.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.197
The funeral's Wednesday.

11:43.360 --> 11:46.432
Wednesday?
What...? What Wednesday?

11:46.600 --> 11:47.999
Two o'clock, Wednesday.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.636
- What?
- I got a softball game on Wednesday.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.949
It's the championship.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.716
So you're not obligated.
Go play in your game.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.031
- I didn't even know the woman.
- So don't go.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.953
I mean, I met her three times.
I don't even know her last name.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.712
Jerry, no one's forcing you.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.077
I mean, who has a funeral
on a Wednesday?

12:06.360 --> 12:08.032
That's what I wanna know.
I mean...

12:08.200 --> 12:10.395
...this is the championship.
I'm hitting everything.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.950
I don't have a dress to wear.
And, you, you don't have anything.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.236
I got my sport jacket.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.832
You're not wearing that to a funeral.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.389
- What's wrong with it?
- It looks ridiculous.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.357
What, I'm gonna buy
a new sport jacket now?

12:23.520 --> 12:24.635
I don't know what to do.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.518
You know what this funeral's gonna
wind up costing me? Oh, boy.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.831
We don't understand death.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.788
And the proof of this is that
we give dead people a pillow.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.551
And, I mean, hey, you know.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.998
I think if you can't stretch out
and get some solid rest at that point...

12:45.480 --> 12:50.270
...I don't see how bedding accessories
really make the difference.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.315
I mean, they got the guy
in a suit, with a pillow.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.870
Now, is he going to a meeting,
or is he catching 40 winks?

12:57.040 --> 13:00.350
I mean, let's make up our mind
where we think they're going.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.152
I actually like ponies.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.039
I was just trying
to make conversation.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.431
- What time is your game?
- 2:45.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.990
- And what time is the funeral?
- Two o'clock.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.993
How long does a funeral take?

13:16.280 --> 13:18.714
Depends on how nice
the person was...

13:19.320 --> 13:22.835
...but you gotta figure
even Oswald took 45 minutes.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.918
So you can't do both.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.355
You know,
if the situation were reversed...

13:28.520 --> 13:32.559
...and Manya had some mahjong
championship or something...

13:32.720 --> 13:36.269
...I wouldn't expect her to go
to my funeral. I would understand.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.029
How can you even consider
not going?

13:39.840 --> 13:41.592
You know, I've been thinking.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.557
I cannot envision
any circumstance...

13:43.720 --> 13:46.871
...in which I'll ever have
the opportunity to have sex again.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.752
How's it gonna happen?

13:53.760 --> 13:55.830
I just don't see how it could occur.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.757
You know, funerals always make me
think about my own mortality...

13:59.920 --> 14:02.878
...and how I'm actually
gonna die someday.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.031
Me, dead.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.635
Imagine that.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.395
They always make me
take stock of my life...

14:09.560 --> 14:13.109
...how I've pretty much wasted all of it
and how I plan to continue wasting it.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.999
I know, then you say to yourself:

14:15.160 --> 14:18.072
"From this moment on,
I'm not gonna waste any more of it."

14:18.240 --> 14:19.639
But then you go, "How?

14:19.800 --> 14:21.711
I mean, what can I do
that's not wasting it?"

14:21.880 --> 14:24.394
Well, is this a waste of time?
What should we be doing?

14:24.560 --> 14:27.279
- Can't you have coffee with people?
- You know...

14:27.440 --> 14:30.113
You know, I can't believe
you're even considering not playing.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.271
We need you.
You're hitting everything.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.591
He has to go.
He may have killed her.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.229
Me?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.595
What about you?
You brought up the pony.

14:41.040 --> 14:46.239
Oh, yeah, but I didn't say
I hated anyone who had one.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.432
- Who's gonna play left field?
- Bender?

14:49.600 --> 14:52.910
Bender? He can't play left.
He stinks.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.356
I just don't see what purpose
it's gonna serve, you going.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.353
I mean, you think dead people care
who's at their funeral?

14:59.520 --> 15:01.476
They don't even know
they're having a funeral.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.918
It's not like she's in the back going,
"I can't believe Jerry didn't show up."

15:06.080 --> 15:08.958
Maybe she's there in spirit.
How about that?

15:09.320 --> 15:13.199
If you're a spirit, and you can travel
to other dimensions and galaxies...

15:13.360 --> 15:15.590
...and find out the mysteries
of the universe...

15:15.760 --> 15:18.991
...you think she'll be at Drexler's
Funeral Home on Ocean Parkway?

15:19.840 --> 15:23.958
George, I met this woman. She is not
travelling to any other dimensions.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.912
Do you know how easy it is
for dead people to travel?

15:28.080 --> 15:30.992
It's not like getting on a bus.
One second:

15:31.160 --> 15:32.309
It's all mental.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.550
Fifty years they were married.
Now he's moving to Phoenix.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.672
Phoenix? What's happening
with his apartment?

15:43.840 --> 15:46.718
I don't know. They've been in there
since, like, World War II.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.916
Rent's $300 a month.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.514
Three hundred a month?

15:51.720 --> 15:54.234
Oh, my God.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.756
Although this may seem
like a sad event...

15:57.920 --> 16:00.275
...it should not be a day of mourning...

16:00.440 --> 16:04.149
...for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.919
She grew up in a different world,
a simpler world...

16:09.080 --> 16:12.709
...with loving parents,
a beautiful home in the country.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.838
And from what I understand,
she even had a pony.

16:17.840 --> 16:21.753
Oh, how she loved that pony.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.079
Even in her declining years,
whenever she would speak of it...

16:27.240 --> 16:29.708
...her eyes would light up.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.310
Its lustrous coat, its flowing mane.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.790
It was the pride of Cracow.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.039
Well, game's starting
just about now.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.794
It was good that the two of you came.
It was a nice gesture.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.520
I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty.
I'm just an intern.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.272
I can't write a note to an airline.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.034
You got your degree. They don't care.
They just wanna see something.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.480
- I just wanted to say how sorry I was.
- Jerry...

17:02.640 --> 17:04.596
...you wanna hear something?

17:05.920 --> 17:08.480
Your cousin Jeffrey
is switching parks.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.392
They're transferring him
to Riverside...

17:10.560 --> 17:13.438
...so he'll completely revamp
that operation, you understand?

17:13.599 --> 17:14.589
Yeah.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.719
He'll do in Riverside now
what he did in Central Park.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.799
More money.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.188
So...

17:22.359 --> 17:24.316
...that's your cousin.

17:25.480 --> 17:29.109
You don't understand.
I've never paid full fare.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.118
Once again, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am...

17:32.280 --> 17:34.271
...about the other night.
- Oh, me too.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.476
Oh, no, no, no.
She forgot all about that.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.910
She was much more upset
about the potato salad.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.390
So I understand
you're moving to Phoenix.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.154
Yeah. My brother lives there.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.595
I think Manya would've
liked Phoenix.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.196
Gorgeous, exquisite town.

17:52.360 --> 17:56.319
So, what's happening
with your apartment?

17:56.720 --> 17:58.039
Of course...

17:58.200 --> 18:00.794
...it's very hot there.
I'll have to get an air conditioner.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.155
Oh, you can have mine.
I'll ship it out to you.

18:03.320 --> 18:08.155
But what about that big apartment
on West End Avenue?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.390
Although, they say it's a dry heat.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.917
Dry, wet. What's happening
with your apartment?

18:15.760 --> 18:18.877
I don't even know if I should take
my winter clothing.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.311
I have an idea.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.472
Leave the winter clothing
in the apartment...

18:25.640 --> 18:27.437
...and I'll watch it for you.

18:27.600 --> 18:32.276
And I'll live there, and I'll make sure
that nothing happens to it.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.830
Oh, the apartment.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.797
Jeffrey's taking the apartment.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.599
- Oh, Jeffrey.
- You know Jeffrey.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.919
Yeah, from what I understand,
he works for the Parks Department.

18:48.840 --> 18:51.832
- It's raining.
- It's raining?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.512
It's raining.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.757
The game will be postponed.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.717
We'll play tomorrow.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.831
Believe me,
I wouldn't bother you...

19:01.000 --> 19:04.470
...if the Army hadn't closed
that base in Sarasota.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.919
- Here, scribble a little something here.
- I can't. I'll get in trouble.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.071
Oh, for God's sake.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.236
Who gets picked off in softball?

19:16.960 --> 19:19.235
- It's unheard-of.
- Never happened to me before.

19:20.040 --> 19:25.273
I remember saying to myself,
"Why is Jerry so far off the base?"

19:25.440 --> 19:28.671
I'll have to live with this shame
for the rest of my life.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.832
Look. Then in the fifth inning,
why did you take off on the pop fly?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.116
I thought there were two outs.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.635
I couldn't believe it
when I saw you running.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.475
I thought maybe they had
changed the rules or something.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.553
It was the single worst moment
of my life.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.273
What about Sharon Besser?

19:45.440 --> 19:47.670
Oh, well, of course, 1973.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.197
- Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
- Wonder about what?

19:52.640 --> 19:55.029
You know, the spirit world.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.358
Wait, you think Manya showed up
during the game and put a hex on me?

20:00.040 --> 20:02.918
I never saw anyone play like that.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.919
But I went to the funeral.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.472
Yeah, but that doesn't make up
for killing her.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.033
Maybe Manya missed the funeral...

20:11.200 --> 20:13.555
...because she was off visiting
another galaxy that day.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.553
Don't you think she would've heard
I was there?

20:16.720 --> 20:18.711
Not necessarily.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.513
Who figures an immigrant
is gonna have a pony?

20:27.240 --> 20:29.800
What is the pony?
What is the point of the pony?

20:29.960 --> 20:32.474
Why do we have these animals,
these ponies?

20:32.640 --> 20:35.677
What do we do with them,
besides the pony ride?

20:35.840 --> 20:37.956
Well, why ponies?
What are we doing with them?

20:38.120 --> 20:40.998
I mean, police don't use them for,
you know, crowd control.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.477
"Hey, you wanna get back
behind the barricades?

20:44.880 --> 20:46.199
Hey.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.873
Hey, little boy.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.076
Yeah, I'm talking to you. Just...

20:50.240 --> 20:52.674
Behind the barricades."

20:56.320 --> 21:00.472
So somebody, I assume,
genetically engineered these ponies.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.474
Think they could make them any size?
Like the size of a quarter if they want?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.793
That would be fun for Monopoly,
wouldn't it? Have a little pony.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.234
And you put him on the...

21:10.400 --> 21:13.278
"Baltic, that's two down. Go ahead.
Hold it. There. Baltic, that's...

21:13.440 --> 21:16.352
Yeah, Fine. Right there,
hold it right there."
