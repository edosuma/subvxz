A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:14.055 --> 00:15.265
[Lorenzo] Hello.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.808
-Let's eat here?
-No.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.602
Our labels showed up in the factory.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.814
Though the investigation was phony.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.484
So they're no use as evidence?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.778
The DA himself could have planted them.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.197
-No, it can't be.
-It can.

00:31.781 --> 00:32.991
Will they accept them?

00:34.367 --> 00:39.289
Their value as evidence is doubtful.
But Pereyra Ramos is getting closer.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.499
-Closer to who?
-To you.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.544
He wants publicity,
and you're the perfect excuse.

00:48.798 --> 00:51.968
ODETTE AMARAL, INÉS MUSCCINI
ONE WORK OF ART, TWO SUICIDES

01:25.668 --> 01:27.670
[officer] Are you Pereyra Ramos, the DA?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.017
[knocking on door]

01:41.726 --> 01:42.769
Yes?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.064
What's up? Enter, Teo.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.902
Pereyra Ramos, DA,
the man I told you about.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.695
You must be the famous Teo?

01:53.738 --> 01:55.240
Not famous yet.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.617
Maybe when I see
my brother's killer in jail.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.506
Why is he out?

02:12.507 --> 02:14.551
Antonio doesn't make decisions,
but he's responsible too.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.179
The law will measure
the degrees of responsibility.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.722
You people let him out.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.101
We...? No, justice doesn't work like that.

02:23.601 --> 02:26.354
Mendelsohn has good lawyers. The best.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.107
These guys sell themselves
to the highest bidder.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.776
-Why believe him?
-He's one of us.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.361
One of you.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.865
-The labels were his idea, too?
-Let's not discuss that here.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.994
I risked my life, all for nothing.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.163
It'll help.

02:43.705 --> 02:44.706
OK.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.961
I don't believe a word he said.
He's complicit, and they'll get away.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.714
-Impossible.
-How are you so sure?

02:53.506 --> 02:55.258
-Talk.
-There are new leads.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.260
The fire could've been intentional.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.263
What? What are you saying?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.724
I'm not sure, but there's a possibility.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.685
-Who's the suspect?
-No one yet.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.313
But they're not short on enemies.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.440
So it wasn't Edha.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.068
It makes no sense.
Why would she sabotage herself?

03:14.152 --> 03:16.279
She's responsible.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.323
The sweatshop worked for the brand.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.741
Let's go.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.410
Does the DA know that?

03:22.493 --> 03:24.871
If it was sabotage,
the DA will cover it up.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.999
-Why would he cover it up?
-Something with his father.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.792
He wants Lorenzo in jail.

03:29.876 --> 03:34.130
Not the arsonist. He's close,
he won't miss this opportunity.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.550
-So he uses the case to get revenge?
-Something like that.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.429
Does anyone here care about
what happened?

03:42.347 --> 03:43.348
The truth?

03:43.806 --> 03:45.225
You and me.

03:45.850 --> 03:49.854
But if the fire was intentional,
the DA is sure to cover it up.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.357
If it was intentional and
he doesn't investigate, I'll kill him.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.817
I swear on my brother, I'll kill him.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.654
[Pastene]Antonio complicated matters
for you.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.282
They pleaded poor technical defense
and the judge hasn't approved the trial.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.410
-Why?
-It all happened very fast.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.288
-In very short time.
-It had to be fast.

04:07.997 --> 04:12.126
It didn't work. With good behavior and his
father vouching for him, he was let out.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.963
I can't be. Someone had a hand in it.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.966
Either way, Antonio is out.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.511
-Is it final?
-No, but he's out.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.930
And there's evidence circulating...

04:24.305 --> 04:25.598
the labels.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.810
We have to do something,

04:28.893 --> 04:31.145
because you and Edha have to testify.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.439
Edha didn't know anything
about the factory.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.317
But she'll be held accountable,
you're partners.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.404
If you fall, she falls too.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.413
-I brought this for Antonio.
-David.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.418
-Does it have  shatnez ?
-Excuse me?

04:53.501 --> 04:54.919
The  tallit  you brought.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.880
It can't have  shatnez .
We don't mix wool and linen.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.842
What is that law based on?

05:00.925 --> 05:03.094
I tell my children Cain and Abel's story.

05:03.177 --> 05:07.598
One day, Cain and Abel had to offer God
the fruit of their labor in sacrifice.

05:08.182 --> 05:12.812
Abel chose a sheep from his herd.
Cain chose linen seeds.

05:12.895 --> 05:16.399
-God completely ignored Cain's offer.
-Wool and linen.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.319
Cain killed his brother,
Abel lost his life.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.904
-Wool and linen don't mix.
-It's prohibited?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.781
It's law. It's not the same.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.577
Evidence of the fact that some mixtures
turn out being deadly.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.412
You'll never understand it.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.290
-Your son is very reliable and mature.
-My son is an idiot.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.167
He thought he could survive a woman

05:34.250 --> 05:36.544
who doesn't take moral responsibility
for her actions.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.713
I helped a lot to get your son out.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.848
-Can you give this to Antonio?
-Yes.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.261
It's good the DA's got it in for them.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.389
It guarantees they'll be put in prison.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.810
If the fire was intentional,
he won't investigate it.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.854
That's a lie from your fat friend.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.482
Who'd set fire to the factory on purpose?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.902
I want Manito's murderers, not a nobody.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.031
-She's to blame.
-She'd never seen the factory.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.242
Doesn't matter if she'd seen it or not.

06:49.867 --> 06:54.122
They made your brother work there.
Factories burn down, she didn't care.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.832
That's what everybody thinks.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.918
-What if someone took advantage?
-Who?

06:59.335 --> 07:02.588
Anybody. They're a mafia,
they do business, they hate each other.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.968
-You didn't see the competition.
-No, I don't.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.594
You didn't explain much.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.013
How did she win
if you set her garment on fire?

07:11.889 --> 07:13.266
I explained it to you.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.894
I didn't understand.
I want you to explain again.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.440
They put a fucking quilt
on your head and you won?

07:20.898 --> 07:24.735
-Maybe I don't have a lot to tell.
-Maybe there's too much.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.656
-Are you jealous?
-Me? Jealous?

07:28.739 --> 07:30.825
-Yes, you.
-Of that rich bitch?

07:32.326 --> 07:33.369
Never.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.462
Mmm.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.801
-What do you want to eat?
-I'm not hungry.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.387
You don't need to be hungry.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.975
It was you, wasn't it? You got him out?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.895
-What are you talking about?
-Antonio.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.565
-I told you not to call me.
-It's just a minute.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.234
Speak with your lawyer,
don't call me again.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.613
I helped you with Elena.
You're seeing her thanks to me.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.699
I'm her father, I have her back.
I don't need you.

08:11.782 --> 08:15.369
She'll be very angry
when she knows you're using her.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.747
There's nothing she can't know.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.625
Let me tell you something,
from experience...

08:21.792 --> 08:24.587
you can't lie to your children.
Not to them.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.673
And you're the exception to that rule?

08:28.007 --> 08:29.175
[phone beeps]

08:38.059 --> 08:39.143
Eat.

08:53.407 --> 08:57.078
[laughter]

09:13.886 --> 09:15.596
-Hi.
-[Jáuregui] Hello!

09:15.972 --> 09:18.432
-Did something happen?
-No, nothing.

09:19.100 --> 09:23.229
What could happen? The usual,
a father coming to pick up his daughter.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.564
[laughs]

09:24.647 --> 09:27.400
-Are you OK?
-Yes, it's just a scrape.

09:27.900 --> 09:32.446
You have to be careful, with so many
bruises no one will hire you as a model.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.157
-I'm careful.
-Of course.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.993
-Let's go?
-Yes.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.039
OK.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.126
Is it embarrassing me picking you up?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.378
- No, it's fine.
- Mmm.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.923
-Did you speak with your mom?
-About what?

09:51.799 --> 09:53.175
What do you mean, about what?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.386
About what happened.

09:57.471 --> 09:58.472
It was serious, Elena.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.685
You could've ended up in the hospital.
Or worse.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.105
No, I'm not speaking to Mom lately.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.483
-She's busy with Milan.
-I'm busy too.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.612
It's the most important time of my career.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.197
Your father is about
to become a federal judge,

10:15.281 --> 10:17.199
and I'm here nonetheless,
with my daughter.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.620
She took care of me when you weren't here.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.748
No one is questioning that.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.756
Elen...

10:33.257 --> 10:36.052
I was talking with Bárbara, and...

10:36.719 --> 10:39.430
the truth is we'd like it very much
if you came home...

10:39.513 --> 10:40.973
to live with us.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.273
-I can't leave Mom alone.
-You won't.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.525
Your mom is a grownup, she's not alone.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.861
Her dad is always around.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.739
Closer than I'd like, but OK.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.367
What can you do? Fathers are like that.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.745
I don't know, it's very soon.

11:03.245 --> 11:06.082
-I have to speak to her.
-Spend time at mine.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.210
Then decide what you want to do.

11:09.543 --> 11:13.422
Get your head straight, hers too.
Get to know each other again,

11:13.506 --> 11:16.050
without the burden of living together,
as grownups.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.387
-Spend some time?
-Right.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.555
Like a vacation.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.103
We have to change that supplier at once.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.564
Don't receive anything. Listen to me.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.025
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.821
[breathes deeply]

11:37.446 --> 11:39.156
What do we know about Delfina?

11:40.491 --> 11:44.870
That she's our daughter,
and that we'd agreed you'd pick her up.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.122
I couldn't.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.417
Me neither.

11:50.709 --> 11:54.880
Hopefully she went for a walk
with her friends. Anyway...

11:55.714 --> 11:58.551
they'll call us if she gets killed
or thrown in jail.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.010
You exaggerate.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.432
-You saw the state of the car.
-Of course.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.642
I asked one favor this morning.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.602
That you pick her up.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.855
We have to be there for her.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.941
I can't leave a surgery half-way.
You know that.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.653
Then why tell me you'd go?

12:19.697 --> 12:23.409
If you can't be a husband,
at least try being a father.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.665
Is something the matter?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.128
-What are you doing?
-Stop!

12:34.211 --> 12:36.046
-What are you doing?
-I said stop!

12:36.297 --> 12:37.506
[car brakes]

12:41.635 --> 12:43.220
Don't come home tonight.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.693
I want you to take charge of the factory,
I'm getting old.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.821
It'll be hard coming back.
I don't know if I want to.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.617
Would you rather go with Edha again?
Look how that turned out.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.453
-What did she want?
-To convince you.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.623
She'll do everything in her power
to get you back.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.167
-Me too.
-I lose a lot if I stay.

13:13.250 --> 13:17.630
Think with your head, not your heart!
What do you want? To live like a beast?

13:18.047 --> 13:21.091
I don't know. This is confusing for me.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.637
In here I can protect you, David.
Out there I can't.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.972
Out there, you're on your own.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.789
It's weird leaving without telling her.
Like I'm running away.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.751
You're not running away.
You're going to your dad's for a while.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.005
-You want to call?
-No, no. I'd rather call her later.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.925
I'll talk to your mother later.

14:04.301 --> 14:08.013
Well, do we have everything?
School books, pajamas, toothbrush?

14:08.097 --> 14:08.973
Yeah.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.601
We have everything, Dad.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.199
[motor starts]

14:36.834 --> 14:37.918
PEREYRA RAMOS, DA

14:38.002 --> 14:41.839
PEREYRA RAMOS, DA PULLED FROM
THE INÉS MUSCCINI CASE

14:44.466 --> 14:47.595
THE DA, FAMOUS FOR THE INÉS
MUSCCINI CASE, PULLED FROM THE CASE

14:47.720 --> 14:50.681
DA PEREYRA RAMOS PULLED FROM
THE INÉS MUSCCINI CASE

15:13.829 --> 15:14.663
Ele!

15:50.991 --> 15:52.534
Jáuregui, where is she?

15:55.329 --> 15:56.622
[Mota] There you have it.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.875
The DA's father.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.420
He took the case of the death
of Edha's mother.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.507
He died shortly after
being pulled from the case.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.217
I told you...

16:08.968 --> 16:12.346
Pereyra Ramos has his reasons,
he could be hiding a sabotage.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.725
What's certain is
that he's against Lorenzo.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.811
How do you know about the sabotage?

16:19.186 --> 16:20.145
I heard.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.273
Just as I protect you,
I protect the others.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.779
If the sabotage is confirmed,
I want to know before the DA.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.407
What are you going to do?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.659
I can't say. I protect you too.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.330
I told you I was staying
with him for a while.

16:38.414 --> 16:42.084
You said you had a room
and wanted to see how you felt.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.753
-Not that you were moving in.
-It's only a few days!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.255
She was going to call you.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.382
-He forced you?
-No.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.301
[Edha] I can't rest knowing you're here.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.846
I don't know if I'm making myself clear.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.515
-I'm her dad!
-A dad that I don't trust.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.604
-Is this punishment?
-It's nothing to do with you.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.440
-I'm not punishing you.
-OK...

17:04.898 --> 17:10.070
We already had dinner
and tomorrow we all get up very early.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.448
-I don't know about you.
-I won't sleep.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.241
[Jáuregui] Hmm.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.993
Stop looking for pity, Edha.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.204
We're adults, we can work this out.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.081
Let's try to do that.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.625
Elena deserves it.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.143
Calm down. You can't talk to me like that.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.229
Until recently,
I was the main person in my life.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.190
And in yours!

17:47.024 --> 17:48.942
Change things back!

17:49.026 --> 17:51.195
Elena didn't mean
to steal anything from you.

17:51.862 --> 17:55.407
I'm very sorry you see it that way.
You're not competing for me.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.410
I'm not talking about your daughter.
Elena is lovely!

17:59.369 --> 18:01.121
I told you to bring her here.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.040
I'm talking about Edha.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.459
I can't stand her.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.461
I said getting Elena wouldn't be easy.

18:08.045 --> 18:11.256
-And that Edha would take advantage.
-Yes, you told me.

18:12.716 --> 18:16.095
You also told me my unborn son
had a 16 year-old sister.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.681
And a 32-year-old mother.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.227
You don't need to be a mathematician
to realize what you did.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.817
I explained what happened
to you in detail.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.945
I didn't know Edha was a minor, she lied.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.114
Say no more.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.699
I ask only one thing of you.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.412
Put her in her place.
This is our time. Don't let her ruin it.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.790
Now we have Salvador.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.877
It's late, I'm at my dad's.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.297
-I need to see you.
-I told you, I can't.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.758
I'm leaving Monina.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.802
I never asked you to.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.054
I'm doing it.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.390
Don't do it.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.350
Elena...

19:04.393 --> 19:07.813
I've made up my mind.
I'm sleeping at the office.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.233
I can't take it anymore.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.193
[knocking on door, door opens]

19:18.824 --> 19:21.827
-Want me to bring you a yogurt?
-No, thank you.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.122
I won't always spoil you like this.
Enjoy it.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.456
I'm not hungry.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.083
OK.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.796
Turn off your phone, it's late.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.340
-Who were you talking to?
-A friend.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.843
-What's her name?
-Emma.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.556
-We talked about Delfina.
-Yes, but it's not her.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.850
OK.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.019
Hang up anyway.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.191
I have to go.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.568
You can't do what you said.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.404
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.995
[Edha]  Alone like this,
I feel the weight of all my mistakes.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.249
My obsession with the past
disconnected me from the present,

20:09.333 --> 20:12.961
made me neglect Elena,
disregard my own daughter.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.548
Was this why my mother abandoned me?

20:16.632 --> 20:18.300
Her obsession with her art?

20:18.383 --> 20:19.718

NEWS

20:43.533 --> 20:46.453
PEREYRA RAMOS DIES FROM ILLNESS

20:46.787 --> 20:50.999
THE DA, FAMOUS FOR THE INÉS MUSCCINI
CASE, WAS PULLED FROM THE CASE

20:51.333 --> 20:53.460
[Edha]  I remember this man perfectly...

20:53.543 --> 20:54.920
Pereyra Ramos.

20:58.507 --> 21:02.302
He asked questions about my
mother's death when I was just a child.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.056
His son is investigating me
for the factory fire.

21:09.393 --> 21:14.398
You didn't listen to me. I told you,
you can't be here. Where's your dad?

21:14.481 --> 21:16.650
He's away, he hasn't arrived yet.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.946
I'll get someone to pick you up.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.495
If your dad isn't here,
someone has to take you.

21:28.578 --> 21:29.913
[Odette] She's with me.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.208
Who are you?

21:34.668 --> 21:37.754
Odette Amaral, a family friend
and Inés's business partner.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.553
-Is this for me?
-No, it's for him.

21:48.598 --> 21:52.144
[Edha]  There's something personal here,
related to Inés's death.

21:52.936 --> 21:56.523
Pereyra Ramos was pulled off the case
and died a short time after.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.610
It all seems connected,
yet it makes no sense.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.406
Why open an investigation
if my mother killed herself?

22:04.865 --> 22:07.075
Why investigate Inés's death?

22:07.409 --> 22:10.287
Above all, who wants me to know all this?

22:17.419 --> 22:20.130
[Julián] Remember, during a surgery
our hands are our eyes.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.966
It's all about closing them
and feeling the textures,

22:23.050 --> 22:26.219
so we can recognize a pathology
merely with our touch.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.098
If we're confident, they will be too.

22:30.182 --> 22:34.186
Always remember, our patients' health
is in our hands, literally.

22:34.269 --> 22:35.771
OK? Well.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.065
See you next time.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.568
Please, leave your email addresses
so I can send you...

22:42.444 --> 22:43.737
the texts.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.531
Thank you. Bye!

22:52.621 --> 22:53.997
What a surprise.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.459
-It's nice you came.
-I had some free time.

22:58.376 --> 22:59.753
Julián, we can't see each other.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.297
Let me finish this so we can talk.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.717
-I only came to say that.
-You have to calm down.

23:05.801 --> 23:09.554
You're insane. What you said about
leaving Monina, you can't do that.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.100
-I don't want to see you.
-You're afraid.

23:13.892 --> 23:18.021
You're afraid. This is no way
to end a relationship, so calm down.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.856
-It is for this.
-No.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.608
We're done.

23:41.711 --> 23:42.963
[music stops]

23:44.840 --> 23:46.341
Touch me, I'll call the cops.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.346
There were things about Edha
I didn't know.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.639
I want to know.

23:53.515 --> 23:56.685
What, you're her thug now?
I have nothing to tell you.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.604
I'm no thug. Least of all Edha's.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.988
There was a fire in a sweatshop
that made clothes for them.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.365
-It caught fire, people died.
-I know that.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.201
Looks like it was sabotage.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.288
-For who?
-For the brand.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.040
[laughs]

24:20.000 --> 24:21.835
-What are you laughing at?
-Nothing.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.838
What do you want to know?

24:26.631 --> 24:29.551
What kind of people are they?
I work for them now.

24:31.469 --> 24:33.471
They ran a sweatshop.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.433
They're not two angels.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.186
But she didn't know.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.105
You believe that?

24:45.901 --> 24:47.611
What happened with Antonio?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.613
They screwed him over.

24:50.530 --> 24:53.200
He went to the sweatshop once.
Lorenzo forced him to go.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.869
Then they pressured him to testify.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.871
They set him up.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.291
Have they done that to many people?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.585
Do they have any enemies?

25:04.461 --> 25:07.214
All the time. They screw everyone.

25:07.923 --> 25:11.301
Me too. They fired me.
I took them to court, won,

25:11.384 --> 25:14.429
but Lorenzo found a way
to make me return every dime.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.560
Who told you the fire was intentional?

25:21.937 --> 25:22.938
No one.

[music plays on headphones]

25:51.383 --> 25:53.426
You're early. The fitting is in two hours.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.930
I know. Can I come in?

25:58.306 --> 25:59.933
I'm not feeling well.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.476
It's important.

26:04.604 --> 26:05.855
Come in.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.156
-I'm not doing the fittings.
-What?

26:15.532 --> 26:18.743
That... I'm not going to do
the fittings for Milan.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.912
Not going to Milan is not an option.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.582
-If it's money, we'll do a new contract.
-Who's the contract with?

26:25.083 --> 26:27.085
-With Lorenzo again?
-Of course.

26:27.168 --> 26:30.338
-He doesn't want anything to do with me.
-Sign with me then.

Do you trust me?

26:41.349 --> 26:43.435
I'm going. I'll be back for the fitting.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.395
Stay.

-No.

Besides, you're wrong. That's not a job.

You went to find out
who killed your brother.

Not even a shower cleans off
that shitty oil they cover you with.

You think all this is normal.

Fuck off, I'm doing what I have to!

31:14.330 --> 31:15.540
You're weak.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.751
Sometimes a situation
forces you to be strong,

31:18.835 --> 31:20.503
to do things you wouldn't otherwise.

Who are you talking about? Me or you?

What happened with Manito changed us,

What things did you do?
Because you know mine.

-Where did you get the money?

32:59.852 --> 33:03.064
Where are you going?
What the fuck do you want here?

33:07.527 --> 33:08.987
Are you in a hurry, baby?

33:16.244 --> 33:17.662
[Celia] Why were you following me?

33:19.372 --> 33:23.209
You have to see this, Celia.
This creep likes spying on people.

33:27.213 --> 33:28.548
Son of a bitch.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.926
-When was this?
-It was today.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.553
Who are you?

33:35.179 --> 33:37.849
I work for the company...for Edha.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.687
-That's your boyfriend, isn't it?
-What the fuck do you care?

33:43.271 --> 33:44.480
Shall I kill him?

33:45.273 --> 33:47.942
I don't care... Let Celia decide.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.669
[Edha]  We come from different places,
but fate brought us together.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.255
Teo is a mystery.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.215
I barely know who he is.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.678
I feel Teo can help me find out who I am,

34:15.762 --> 34:18.806
face my fears, free myself from my past.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.273
Edha.

34:27.356 --> 34:28.983
[inhales]

34:29.984 --> 34:31.444
Let's talk tomorrow.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.447
[Edha]  Perhaps this is love.

34:35.656 --> 34:36.908
To trust.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.660
[exhales deeply]

34:40.661 --> 34:45.666
[both speak French]

34:46.375 --> 34:47.460
[laughs]

34:47.543 --> 34:50.254
[speaks French]

34:50.338 --> 34:51.756
Let's do some actual work.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.174
[knocking on door]

34:54.467 --> 34:55.802
What is it?

34:56.511 --> 34:57.512
[door opens]

34:57.595 --> 35:00.765
-What is it, man? Couldn't you call?
-No.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.017
-What happened?
-Teo...

35:04.185 --> 35:05.561
I know who he is.

35:21.994 --> 35:24.413
[cellphone rings]

35:26.666 --> 35:27.834
What is it?

35:28.417 --> 35:29.836
[Lorenzo]  Are you sleeping alone?

35:30.211 --> 35:32.797
-Do I have to tell you who I'm with?
-No...

35:33.214 --> 35:35.424
I will tell you who you're with.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.520
