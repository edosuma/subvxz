WEBVTT

00:03.834 --> 00:04.902
Well, thanks for coming.

00:04.902 --> 00:06.203
And tell your friends
they're welcome to come

00:06.203 --> 00:07.771
and discuss their husbands,
their boyfriends

00:07.771 --> 00:10.340
and their husbands'
boyfriends.

00:10.340 --> 00:11.175
What is it about coffee

00:11.175 --> 00:13.577
that makes people want
to spill their guts?

00:13.577 --> 00:15.245
I don't know, but those guts
are going to buy me

00:15.245 --> 00:17.614
an outside cabin
on a Caribbean cruise.

00:17.614 --> 00:19.183
Yeah, this little beverage
venture of yours

00:19.183 --> 00:20.317
does seem to be
paying off.

00:20.317 --> 00:21.318
Yes, it does.

00:21.318 --> 00:23.320
This month I may actually
turn my first profit.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.321
Whoo-hoo!

00:24.321 --> 00:26.223
I mean, ka-ching.

00:26.223 --> 00:28.158
I just wish I didn't have to
wait until the end of the month

00:28.158 --> 00:29.793
to see if I made a profit.

00:29.793 --> 00:30.928
Wait a minute, I don't.

00:30.928 --> 00:34.131
I'll just call in
my Profit Prophet, Harvey.

00:35.799 --> 00:37.401
Your Profit Prophet
is a big bunny?

00:37.401 --> 00:39.937
Oops. Wrong Harvey.

00:41.738 --> 00:42.973
Really wrong Harvey.

00:42.973 --> 00:44.641
Hi, Harvey.
How you doing?

00:44.641 --> 00:47.144
You know I've been
thinking about you
a lot recently and...

00:47.144 --> 00:49.046
No time for chitchat.

00:50.380 --> 00:50.948
Finally.

00:50.948 --> 00:53.383
Sabrina, meet Harvey,
the Profit Prophet.

00:53.383 --> 00:55.485
Hi. Nice staff.

00:55.485 --> 00:58.088
Yes, the ladies seem to like it.

00:58.088 --> 00:59.423
So, Harvey, is Hilda's

00:59.423 --> 01:01.825
going to be showered
with shekels by the 30th?

01:01.825 --> 01:04.161
Let's have a look-see.

01:05.229 --> 01:07.197
Nothing is coming.

01:08.265 --> 01:11.401
You mean nothing's
coming for free.

01:11.401 --> 01:11.802
Oh, so I guess

01:11.802 --> 01:14.137
he's not a non-
profit Prophet.

01:14.137 --> 01:16.573
So what's the deal,
am I going to make money or not?

01:16.573 --> 01:20.711
Not if you keep piddling
it away like this.

01:22.412 --> 01:24.548
Next time I go with Isaiah.

01:28.318 --> 01:34.825
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:34.825 --> 01:41.098
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:41.098 --> 01:44.434
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:44.434 --> 01:50.741

02:15.032 --> 02:16.266
I can't believe this.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.467
I've already got
a ton of homework.

02:17.467 --> 02:18.969
How am I supposed to
write a five-page essay

02:18.969 --> 02:21.972
on Hamlet's speech as
a window to his madness?

02:21.972 --> 02:23.507
What about the window
to <i>my</i> madness?

02:23.507 --> 02:24.074
I'm swamped, too.

02:24.074 --> 02:26.009
I have to write
a paper on Picasso

02:26.009 --> 02:27.878
then study for my exams
on Organic Chemistry

02:27.878 --> 02:29.146
and Comparative Religions.

02:29.146 --> 02:29.980
How do you do all this

02:29.980 --> 02:31.715
and fit in baseball
practice every day?

02:31.715 --> 02:33.183
I've learned to multi-task.

02:33.183 --> 02:34.751
I'm on my way
to the batting cages

02:34.751 --> 02:37.254
and I'm bringing my audio
version of <i>The Koran.</i>

02:37.254 --> 02:38.655
-See ya.
-Later.

02:38.655 --> 02:39.623
Hey, how's it going?

02:39.623 --> 02:42.693
About as well as Nervous
Breakdown 101 can go.

02:42.693 --> 02:44.494
Well, you haven't bitten
down to the cuticle yet.

02:44.494 --> 02:45.495
That's a good sign.

02:45.495 --> 02:47.331
Like I didn't have enough
studying already.

02:47.331 --> 02:48.699
Now I've got to write
an essay on <i>Hamlet.</i>

02:48.699 --> 02:49.900
This school is killing me.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.235
They expect me to go to class
all day, study all night

02:52.235 --> 02:53.303
and get straight As.

02:53.303 --> 02:54.771
You don't need
straight As.

02:54.771 --> 02:56.373
After last semester's
grades I do

02:56.373 --> 02:58.175
or else I'll lose
my scholarship.

02:58.175 --> 02:59.176
Wow. That's rough.

02:59.176 --> 03:00.544
I don't even have
a scholarship

03:00.544 --> 03:01.545
hanging over my head

03:01.545 --> 03:03.513
and I'm already
stressed out enough.

03:03.513 --> 03:05.682
My statistics class
is killing me.

03:05.682 --> 03:07.784
Here comes my professor.
He's a complete tyrant.

03:07.784 --> 03:08.885
Congratulations,
Sabrina.

03:08.885 --> 03:11.388
You aced another
data analysis test.

03:11.388 --> 03:14.691
You've got a true gift
for numbers.

03:14.691 --> 03:15.792
Do you see what I mean?

03:15.792 --> 03:17.361
What a jerk.

03:20.564 --> 03:22.399
Here's my estimated
monthly sales gross.

03:22.399 --> 03:24.301
And here's my
projected annual gross

03:24.301 --> 03:25.769
with a pudding
stain on it.

03:25.769 --> 03:27.471
Gross.

03:27.471 --> 03:29.339
Hilda, if you want
to turn a profit

03:29.339 --> 03:31.274
you're going to
have to cut costs.

03:31.274 --> 03:32.709
SALEM:
Or if you really want

03:32.709 --> 03:34.177
to make some serious moola

03:34.177 --> 03:36.680
talk to my investment counselor,
Sid.

03:36.680 --> 03:37.280
MAN:
Hello?

03:37.280 --> 03:42.185
Yeah, Sid, put me down for $100
on Run Like Hell in the fifth.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.229
Hey, Morgan,
you almost ready?

03:52.229 --> 03:53.530
MORGAN:
One more minute.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.599
I'm layering my scent.

03:55.599 --> 03:58.001
I don't want to know
what that means.

03:58.835 --> 04:00.470
Okay, how does this sound?

04:00.470 --> 04:02.372
"Hamlet, the young Danish prince

04:02.372 --> 04:04.941
is possibly one of
Shakespeare's most..."

04:04.941 --> 04:06.710
most... most...

04:06.710 --> 04:08.945
Most repetitive characters?

04:08.945 --> 04:10.213
Okay, so now you're
making fun of me.

04:10.213 --> 04:11.648
Like I'm not under
enough pressure.

04:11.648 --> 04:13.116
If I read this play
one more time

04:13.116 --> 04:15.118
my brain's going to explode.

04:15.118 --> 04:18.655
Well, now you've officially
graduated to Madness 102.

04:18.655 --> 04:19.523
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

04:23.026 --> 04:24.795
-Ryan, come on in.
-Thanks.

04:24.795 --> 04:26.196
Let me guess,
you're here because

04:26.196 --> 04:28.432
you're having as much trouble
with this Hamlet paper as I am?

04:28.432 --> 04:30.667
Uh, no. Morgan's fixing me up
with a friend of hers.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.102
We're doubling
with her and Josh.

04:32.102 --> 04:34.438
-Oh, hey, Ryan.
-Hey, how's it going?

04:34.438 --> 04:35.772
How do you have time
to go out on a date?

04:35.772 --> 04:37.040
Don't tell me you already
finished your paper?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.542
I'll do it after the date.

04:38.542 --> 04:40.377
You know what they say,
"All work and no play..."

04:40.377 --> 04:41.745
Leads to the eventual
destruction

04:41.745 --> 04:43.413
of the cerebral cortex.

04:44.681 --> 04:46.817
Maybe it's just my family.

04:47.350 --> 04:48.618
All ready.

04:48.618 --> 04:51.288
Morgan, we're just going
to Denny's for a burger.

04:51.288 --> 04:53.457
You never know
who you might run into.

04:53.457 --> 04:54.524
Yeah, there might
be a fry cook there

04:54.524 --> 04:56.693
that can put you on
the cover of <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

04:56.693 --> 04:57.828
( <i>laughs</i> )

04:57.828 --> 04:58.695
Come on, guys.

04:58.695 --> 05:00.497
See ya later.

05:01.898 --> 05:02.933
What's up with that?

05:02.933 --> 05:04.601
Yeah, I didn't smell
any layers in her scent.

05:04.601 --> 05:05.802
Not her, Ryan.

05:05.802 --> 05:07.537
Well now he smelled good.

05:07.537 --> 05:09.206
He knocks off his paper
in his spare time

05:09.206 --> 05:11.041
and mine's going
to take me all night.

05:11.041 --> 05:12.209
I must be really stupid.

05:12.209 --> 05:13.643
Well, first of all,
you don't know

05:13.643 --> 05:15.712
what Ryan's work looks
like when he turns it in.

05:15.712 --> 05:18.348
Second of all, you know
college is stressful enough.

05:18.348 --> 05:19.616
Don't add to it by trying
to compare yourself

05:19.616 --> 05:20.684
to everybody else.

05:20.684 --> 05:22.185
I hate to break it to you
but that's what

05:22.185 --> 05:24.187
the whole grading
system's about.

05:24.187 --> 05:26.022
Oh, well, in that case...

05:26.022 --> 05:26.723
what are you talking to me for?

05:26.723 --> 05:28.191
You got a paper to write, missy.

05:32.863 --> 05:33.930
Hey, Morgan.

05:33.930 --> 05:35.599
By the look of last night's
eye shadow on your chin

05:35.599 --> 05:37.234
I'm guessing
the evening went well.

05:37.234 --> 05:39.736
Oh, it was fantastic.

05:39.736 --> 05:41.438
We all ended up at this party
till 4:00 in the morning.

05:41.438 --> 05:42.372
Really? That's about
the same time

05:42.372 --> 05:46.109
that Roxie got done
with her <i>Hamlet</i> paper.

05:46.109 --> 05:48.245
You know, if I liked her more,
I'd sort of feel bad for her.

05:48.245 --> 05:50.514
You know, Roxie works her tail
off for her GPA.

05:50.514 --> 05:52.315
How is Ryan able to go out
and party all night

05:52.315 --> 05:53.483
and still get good grades?

05:53.483 --> 05:55.418
Hello, star pitcher
for the baseball team?

05:55.418 --> 05:58.255
Hello, don't understand what
that has to do with anything.

05:58.255 --> 06:00.190
Sabrina, you are so naive.

06:00.190 --> 06:03.026
The school grades
athletes way easier.

06:03.026 --> 06:05.896
Plus the coaches encourage
those guys to take cake classes

06:05.896 --> 06:07.564
which are guaranteed As.

06:07.564 --> 06:09.166
Like Bowling
and Lifestyle Skills

06:09.166 --> 06:11.434
which, by the way, I aced.

06:11.434 --> 06:12.702
Giving any student
that kind

06:12.702 --> 06:14.905
of preferential treatment
is totally unethical.

06:14.905 --> 06:17.140
( <i>yawns</i> ):
Yeah. Anyway.
Whatever.

06:18.108 --> 06:19.176
Hey, Aunt Zelda

06:19.176 --> 06:21.344
have you ever been told to
take it easier academically

06:21.344 --> 06:22.979
on star athletes?
-No.

06:22.979 --> 06:25.482
Although, I must admit I don't
get a lot of middle linebackers

06:25.482 --> 06:26.883
taking Advanced
Quantum Mechanics.

06:26.883 --> 06:27.918
Why do you ask?

06:27.918 --> 06:29.586
It seems to be a practice
that goes on here

06:29.586 --> 06:30.654
with certain teachers.

06:30.654 --> 06:31.955
( <i>gasps</i> ):
That's appalling.

06:31.955 --> 06:33.256
You know the same thing happened

06:33.256 --> 06:35.225
with the Varsity Jousters
in high school.

06:35.225 --> 06:37.827
In Alchemy, Merlin just let
them pull As out of a hat.

06:37.827 --> 06:39.863
Did you do anything about it?

06:39.863 --> 06:41.898
When was the last time
you saw a jouster?

06:50.073 --> 06:52.175
This calls for a closer
inspection.

06:52.175 --> 06:54.044
Much closer.

07:00.217 --> 07:01.451
Roxie's paper.

07:01.451 --> 07:03.420
She'll definitely get an "A."

07:04.854 --> 07:08.158
Hey. She worked
really hard on that.

07:08.425 --> 07:10.594
And that tickles.

07:22.973 --> 07:25.675
An "A" for party boy,
that's insane.

07:25.675 --> 07:27.444
I'll fix that.

07:27.577 --> 07:30.247
( <i>Sabrina grunting</i> )

07:34.017 --> 07:36.086
Okay.

07:36.086 --> 07:37.554
That's more like it.

07:41.224 --> 07:44.394
Ow. Hey.
Watch the earrings.

07:44.394 --> 07:47.163
Hey! Hey!

07:47.597 --> 07:50.066
No, no!

07:50.066 --> 07:53.336
This is the last time
I buy from Staples.

07:53.336 --> 07:57.540
I wonder if there's any
Dramamine in that drawer.

07:57.540 --> 07:58.908
Too late.

07:58.908 --> 08:00.477
( <i>grunts</i> )

08:10.920 --> 08:13.556
Sabrina, you've been working
on that article for hours.

08:13.556 --> 08:14.958
Can I get you anything?

08:14.958 --> 08:17.527
Either a solution to unfair
grading practices for athletes

08:17.527 --> 08:19.195
or a pumpkin bagel.

08:19.195 --> 08:21.031
Pumpkin bagel coming up.

08:22.666 --> 08:24.834
Hey, where are
the pumpkin bagels?

08:24.834 --> 08:26.703
In the pumpkin bagel patch?

08:26.703 --> 08:28.405
Huh?

08:28.405 --> 08:30.040
In the interest
of lowering overhead

08:30.040 --> 08:32.809
we are no longer in the exotic
carbohydrate business.

08:32.809 --> 08:34.911
From now on, all we sell
are plain bagels

08:34.911 --> 08:36.046
and glazed doughnuts.

08:36.046 --> 08:39.883
Hilda, we have an eclectic,
sophisticated clientele.

08:39.883 --> 08:41.618
All right, a lot of the people
who come in here

08:41.618 --> 08:44.120
look forward to their
cran-apple poppy seed scones.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.155
They may like them

08:45.155 --> 08:47.190
but in order for me
to turn a decent profit

08:47.190 --> 08:48.224
I would have
to charge separately

08:48.224 --> 08:51.328
for the crans, the apples
and the poppy seeds.

08:51.328 --> 08:53.430
Well, hey, if all you're
worried about is profit

08:53.430 --> 08:55.131
why don't you just start
making the cappuccinos

08:55.131 --> 08:57.534
with instant coffee?

08:57.534 --> 08:58.868
Way ahead of you.

08:58.868 --> 09:00.837
You just put in some
hot, steamed mocha mix

09:00.837 --> 09:01.738
sprinkle cinnamon on it.

09:01.738 --> 09:03.506
Nobody will know
the difference...

09:03.506 --> 09:05.308
except my accountant.

09:08.244 --> 09:11.081
This article of yours is causing
quite a stir on campus.

09:11.081 --> 09:13.316
Oh, well, isn't that the
purpose of good journalism?

09:13.316 --> 09:15.585
To shine a light on important
issues and make people think?

09:15.585 --> 09:17.787
Exactly--and rumor has it
the school is going to

09:17.787 --> 09:20.056
crack down on preferential
grading practices.

09:20.056 --> 09:21.124
Oh that's great.

09:21.124 --> 09:22.325
I'm really happy for Roxie.

09:22.325 --> 09:23.727
Finally the playing field
will be level.

09:23.727 --> 09:25.128
I'm very proud of you,
Sabrina.

09:25.128 --> 09:26.563
You stood up
for what was right

09:26.563 --> 09:28.765
and you didn't have to cast
a pox on any jousters.

09:28.765 --> 09:30.967
You deserve a pat on the back.

09:30.967 --> 09:32.268
Hey, there she is.

09:32.268 --> 09:33.737
Nice work, Spellman.

09:33.737 --> 09:35.004
Oh, hey, you like my article?

09:35.004 --> 09:36.373
Loved every word.

09:36.373 --> 09:38.975
Thanks to you, I'm out of the
big playoff game on Saturday.

09:38.975 --> 09:39.442
What?

09:39.442 --> 09:40.643
The coach just benched me

09:40.643 --> 09:42.245
until I finish
all my assignments.

09:42.245 --> 09:43.546
I hope you're
proud of yourself.

09:43.546 --> 09:47.684
You just cost Adams College
the championship.

09:50.053 --> 09:52.021
At least I didn't
give anyone a pox.

09:52.021 --> 09:53.022
Way to go, Sabrina.

09:53.022 --> 09:54.624
Because of your stupid article

09:54.624 --> 09:56.626
I can kiss my "A"
in Bowling good-bye.

09:56.626 --> 09:57.927
What are you talking about?

09:57.927 --> 09:59.028
You're taking Bowling?

09:59.028 --> 10:01.131
I needed a cake class
to keep up my GPA.

10:01.131 --> 10:02.198
Bowling was the one course

10:02.198 --> 10:04.334
where I didn't have to work my
tail off to get a good grade.

10:04.334 --> 10:05.635
But now because of you,
my teacher says

10:05.635 --> 10:08.037
we actually have to show up
and learn how to bowl.

10:08.037 --> 10:09.172
You're really taking Bowling?

10:09.172 --> 10:11.908
Yes. And now I have to get
an "A" on the Bowling final.

10:11.908 --> 10:13.343
There's a Bowling final?

10:13.343 --> 10:14.978
There is now.

10:14.978 --> 10:16.246
Look, I'm sorry, I really am.

10:16.246 --> 10:17.914
I just wanted
to make things fair.

10:17.914 --> 10:19.082
For you, for everybody.

10:19.082 --> 10:20.683
Well, I'm not everybody.

10:20.683 --> 10:22.218
I'm just someone who's
going to fail Bowling

10:22.218 --> 10:24.053
and lose her scholarship.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.222
Thanks a lot, Spellman.

10:27.590 --> 10:30.293
Can't believe this is happening.

10:30.293 --> 10:32.829
Can't believe
there's a Bowling final.

10:43.139 --> 10:46.009
One glaze donut
and freeze-dried
coffee coming up.

10:46.009 --> 10:47.677
Thank you kindly, son.

10:47.677 --> 10:50.313
So, how much rain you figure
we're going to get?

10:50.313 --> 10:53.416
Same amount as when you
asked me five minutes ago.

10:53.416 --> 10:54.818
That's true.

10:54.818 --> 10:57.153
Those dang weathermen
never get it right.

10:57.153 --> 10:59.789
How much do you think
weathermen get paid?

10:59.789 --> 11:02.859
The same amount as when you
asked me five minutes ago.

11:02.859 --> 11:04.894
You have a nice day now.

11:04.894 --> 11:06.996
Well, that depends on
the weather, doesn't it?

11:06.996 --> 11:09.499
You're catching on.

11:09.499 --> 11:11.267
Hilda, this
glaze-donut crowd

11:11.267 --> 11:12.502
is driving me crazy.

11:12.502 --> 11:14.804
I'm ready to beat
my head against the
espresso machine.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.606
Do it quick
'cause I'm trading down

11:16.606 --> 11:18.341
to an instant
hot cocoa dispenser.

11:18.341 --> 11:21.177
Thanks to the glaze-donut crowd,
I'm rolling in dough.

11:21.177 --> 11:22.412
Nothing against making money

11:22.412 --> 11:24.180
but the quality of
conversation in here

11:24.180 --> 11:25.949
has gone from
"Is there a god?" to

11:25.949 --> 11:28.952
"Are you bass biting
down at the lake?"

11:28.952 --> 11:30.720
I had no idea
you were such an elitist.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.555
You need to embrace
the down-homesiness

11:32.555 --> 11:34.591
of our new customers.

11:34.591 --> 11:35.325
( <i>southern accent</i> ):
Hi, Wayne.
Huh?

11:35.325 --> 11:36.493
Knee still acting up?

11:36.493 --> 11:36.960
( <i>groaning</i> )

11:36.960 --> 11:38.862
Lorene, let me know
which hot dish to bring

11:38.862 --> 11:39.829
to fellowship supper.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.699
( <i>gasping</i> ):
I love that new leg, Fred.

11:42.699 --> 11:44.801
Aunt Hilda, since when
do you talk like someone

11:44.801 --> 11:46.169
who married
their first cousin?

11:46.169 --> 11:50.473
Since it started making me
a pickle barrel of cash. Yeehaw.

11:50.473 --> 11:52.475
Check your I.Q.
at the door.

11:52.475 --> 11:54.878
Our new customers say
it's looking like rain

11:54.878 --> 11:57.213
over and over
and over again.

11:57.213 --> 11:58.181
Well, I'd rather
hear about the rain

11:58.181 --> 12:00.683
than how I'm responsible
for Adam's star pitcher

12:00.683 --> 12:03.953
not playing in the game
against Emerson on Saturday.

12:03.953 --> 12:06.189
Josh, do you think
writing that article
was a mistake?

12:06.189 --> 12:07.457
Absolutely not.

12:07.457 --> 12:09.959
You stuck with your convictions,
you took a stand

12:09.959 --> 12:11.628
you let everybody know
that Sabrina Spellman

12:11.628 --> 12:13.863
cares about what's right.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.832
Thanks, Josh.

12:15.832 --> 12:17.901
Wait a minute, you don't
care about the principle.

12:17.901 --> 12:19.802
You just want your school
to win on Saturday.

12:19.802 --> 12:21.971
I want justice to win.

12:21.971 --> 12:24.107
And if my school should
benefit in the process

12:24.107 --> 12:25.575
so be it.

12:25.575 --> 12:29.145
( <i>Southern accent</i> ):
You have a nice day now.

12:29.145 --> 12:29.612
Excuse me.

12:29.612 --> 12:31.848
Any chance it's fixin'
to rain on Saturday?

12:31.848 --> 12:34.417
Could be, 'cause
my knee is actin' up.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.885
Course, could be
from the other day

12:35.885 --> 12:37.253
when I bent down funny.

12:37.253 --> 12:38.955
Oh, geez, there it is.

12:49.265 --> 12:50.767
Hey.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.202
Oh... it's you.

12:53.202 --> 12:55.939
You're not still mad at me
about the game, are you?

12:55.939 --> 12:57.440
No. Now I'm mad at you

12:57.440 --> 13:00.009
because you put a major crimp
in my social life.

13:00.009 --> 13:02.345
Ryan was going to take
Josh and me to a party

13:02.345 --> 13:04.681
but now he's home,
chained to his books.

13:04.681 --> 13:06.349
Look, I know it seems unfair now

13:06.349 --> 13:08.952
but in 20 years, somebody
somewhere will thank me.

13:08.952 --> 13:10.920
Please, God, I hope.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.722
It certainly
won't be me.

13:12.722 --> 13:13.456
Me, either.

13:13.456 --> 13:15.792
Thanks to you, I have
to study Introduction
to Bowling Theory

13:15.792 --> 13:18.728
for the all-important
written portion of
my final exam.

13:18.728 --> 13:20.663
Then I'll have
exactly one hour
to throw a bowling ball

13:20.663 --> 13:22.599
that doesn't land
in the snack bar.

13:22.599 --> 13:23.366
I know how to bowl.

13:23.366 --> 13:24.667
I could give you
some pointers.

13:24.667 --> 13:25.868
Oh, that's a great idea.

13:25.868 --> 13:27.804
Miles is probably
an incredible bowler.

13:27.804 --> 13:29.539
I mean, that is a face
that screams

13:29.539 --> 13:31.007
"I own my own ball."

13:31.007 --> 13:34.110
16 pounds, orange marble
<i>with</i> a monogrammed bag.

13:34.110 --> 13:37.013
You can lift a
16-pound ball with
those scrawny arms?

13:37.013 --> 13:40.016
Believe me,
it took years of conditioning.

13:40.016 --> 13:42.418
Look, it's a great
learning opportunity.

13:42.418 --> 13:43.620
Plus, you're desperate.

13:43.620 --> 13:44.387
Go!

13:44.387 --> 13:47.023
Fine. I mean, great.

13:47.023 --> 13:49.425
Let me just grab a wrist guard,
chamois and rosin bag.

13:49.425 --> 13:51.728
It only gets better.

13:54.731 --> 13:57.133
Oh! I'm never going
to learn this!

13:57.133 --> 13:58.468
Sure you will.

13:58.468 --> 14:00.870
It's very simple.

14:00.870 --> 14:04.707
First, you step forward
on the right foot.

14:04.707 --> 14:07.543
Extend the ball,
going through a down-swing.

14:07.543 --> 14:11.080
Then, bring the ball
into a back-swing slowly

14:11.080 --> 14:13.750
as the left foot
gradually comes forward.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.085
Then, when you reach
the top of the back-swing

14:16.085 --> 14:18.087
step forward on the right foot

14:18.087 --> 14:20.657
going through a slide
on the left foot.

14:20.657 --> 14:22.859
Then, at precisely
the moment the slide ends

14:22.859 --> 14:25.928
release the ball, thumb first,
and position your hand

14:25.928 --> 14:28.665
at approximately
a 45-degree angle to your eyes.

14:28.665 --> 14:31.200
And that's all
there is to it?

14:32.669 --> 14:36.005
No. I like to do
a little dance right about now.

14:40.977 --> 14:42.912
Hey, Salem,
have you seen Aunt Zelda?

14:42.912 --> 14:45.615
Since when did I become
her personal secretary?

14:45.615 --> 14:47.417
Hey which horse do
you like better?

14:47.417 --> 14:49.786
Shaved Turkey or Slap Me Silly?

14:49.786 --> 14:51.587
I know I'd like
to slap <i>you</i> silly.

14:51.587 --> 14:53.589
And I'd like to shave a turkey.

14:53.589 --> 14:54.791
The point is

14:54.791 --> 14:56.793
I've got to pick a horse
and call my bookie.

14:56.793 --> 14:58.394
Oh, by the by

14:58.394 --> 15:00.763
I've also got
a boatload riding

15:00.763 --> 15:02.265
on the Adams-Emerson game.

15:02.265 --> 15:04.333
Well, I hope you didn't bet
on Adams.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.537
Thanks to my article,
the star pitcher can't play

15:07.537 --> 15:09.305
and everyone's expecting us
to lose big.

15:09.305 --> 15:11.841
( <i>gasping</i> ):
I've got to page Sid
at the track

15:11.841 --> 15:13.710
and tell him I meant Emerson!

15:13.710 --> 15:18.014
God, I hope he's still sober.

15:18.014 --> 15:19.482
Hi, honey.

15:19.482 --> 15:21.417
I'm so glad to see you.

15:21.417 --> 15:21.984
I can guarantee

15:21.984 --> 15:22.952
you're the only
person in town

15:22.952 --> 15:24.120
who said <i>that</i> today.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.855
You should be proud
of what you did.

15:25.855 --> 15:27.223
You tried to correct
an injustice

15:27.223 --> 15:28.858
and that's truly admirable.

15:28.858 --> 15:30.059
Then why is everyone
looking at me like

15:30.059 --> 15:32.995
I'm the one who told Felicity
to cut her hair?

15:32.995 --> 15:35.832
Sabrina, you don't do
a selfless thing for the glory.

15:35.832 --> 15:37.400
You do it
because it's right.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.236
Well, I don't think it's right
that Roxie lose her scholarship

15:40.236 --> 15:42.638
or for Adams to lose
the big game.

15:42.638 --> 15:44.674
There's got to be some way
to set things right.

15:44.674 --> 15:47.477
Well, you could use your powers
to make it rain frogs

15:47.477 --> 15:49.145
but that's been done to death.

15:49.145 --> 15:50.780
What about cats and dogs?

15:50.780 --> 15:52.281
If you think frogs are messy...

15:52.281 --> 15:54.817
Acid rain? No. Too much.

15:54.817 --> 15:56.486
I'll come up with something.

16:03.126 --> 16:06.028
Yes! I think I'm finally
getting the hang of this.

16:06.028 --> 16:07.830
What's my score now?

16:07.830 --> 16:09.966
12, in the fifth frame.

16:09.966 --> 16:10.933
Is that good?

16:10.933 --> 16:13.102
Only if you're on a respirator.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.637
Guys, how's
the lesson going?

16:14.637 --> 16:15.705
Do you really
want to know?

16:15.705 --> 16:17.673
I don't know. Do I?

16:17.673 --> 16:19.075
My final starts
in five minutes

16:19.075 --> 16:20.610
and the only way
I'm going to pass

16:20.610 --> 16:23.212
is if I run down the alley
and throw myself at the pins.

16:23.212 --> 16:25.214
Do they allow that?

16:25.214 --> 16:26.949
Hey, I've never taken bowling.

16:26.949 --> 16:29.118
I'm telling you,
you can do this.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.253
I showed you
all the moves.

16:30.253 --> 16:32.054
You just have to relax.

16:32.054 --> 16:34.323
My scholarship's going
right into the gutter.

16:34.323 --> 16:35.892
How am I supposed to relax?

16:35.892 --> 16:36.993
I may have a way.

16:36.993 --> 16:38.294
Roxie's too uptight, we know.

16:38.294 --> 16:40.229
Chill her out,
so she can bowl like a pro.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.353
Very nice!

17:04.353 --> 17:05.054
Got to go.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.029
( <i>knocking at door</i> )

17:13.296 --> 17:14.530
( <i>sighs</i> )

17:17.567 --> 17:19.435
Okay, let me start
by saying I'm sorry.

17:19.435 --> 17:20.603
Now that that's done

17:20.603 --> 17:21.904
let's get down to business.

17:21.904 --> 17:22.805
Excuse me?

17:22.805 --> 17:23.940
You got to finish your work

17:23.940 --> 17:25.408
and bring your grades up
by Saturday

17:25.408 --> 17:26.576
and I'm here to help.

17:26.576 --> 17:27.743
You want to help?

17:27.743 --> 17:30.046
Turn around, and walk
back out that door.

17:30.046 --> 17:32.381
Okay, Ryan, look,
you're probably so overwhelmed

17:32.381 --> 17:33.449
you don't even know
where to begin

17:33.449 --> 17:35.284
and you've probably forgotten
how to study

17:35.284 --> 17:37.286
you've skated by for so long.

17:37.286 --> 17:39.322
And you're certainly not going
to get anywhere by doodling

17:39.322 --> 17:40.489
"I hate Sabrina."

17:40.489 --> 17:43.226
Yeah, well, what am I
supposed to do?

17:43.226 --> 17:45.895
First of all, never spell
"Sabrina" with three Ns.

17:45.895 --> 17:47.930
Second of all, the sooner
we open these books

17:47.930 --> 17:49.498
the sooner you'll be
on that playing field.

17:49.498 --> 17:50.900
I don't think that's
going to happen.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.335
Sit down,
and let's talk <i>Hamlet.</i>

17:53.569 --> 17:55.338
So, I finally break down

17:55.338 --> 17:57.640
and get myself one of
them ridin' mowers

17:57.640 --> 17:58.474
and what happens?

17:58.474 --> 17:59.909
It rains for days

17:59.909 --> 18:02.511
so I can't mow my lawn.

18:02.511 --> 18:04.413
It's the darndest thing.

18:04.413 --> 18:05.648
"The darndest thing"?

18:05.648 --> 18:07.984
I'll tell you
what's the darndest thing.

18:07.984 --> 18:09.318
This conversation

18:09.318 --> 18:11.687
and every conversation
I've had in this place

18:11.687 --> 18:13.956
since you glaze-donut
people took over.

18:13.956 --> 18:16.993
All you talk about is
the weather, your fish

18:16.993 --> 18:18.427
and your farm equipment.

18:18.427 --> 18:20.062
I don't care about profits.

18:20.062 --> 18:22.398
I want my cran-apple poppy-seed
people back.

18:22.398 --> 18:23.466
Cran-apple poppy seed?!

18:23.466 --> 18:24.533
That's crazy talk!

18:24.533 --> 18:25.534
Oh, yeah?

18:25.534 --> 18:27.036
Well, how's this for crazy talk?

18:27.036 --> 18:29.071
Skeedaddle! Shoo! Shoo!

18:29.071 --> 18:31.073
Y'all, don't come
back now, ya hear?

18:31.073 --> 18:32.842
And take
this complimentary jar

18:32.842 --> 18:34.644
of freeze-dried coffee
with you.

18:34.644 --> 18:36.479
The missus will
really like this.

18:36.479 --> 18:38.848
( <i>sighing</i> )
Thanks, boss.

18:45.788 --> 18:48.357
Anyone want some of
my tofu seaweed omelet?

18:48.357 --> 18:49.659
Sure, I'll try it.

18:49.659 --> 18:51.560
Ooh, it's not to eat

18:51.560 --> 18:53.696
it's a deep-cleaning
facial mask.

18:53.696 --> 18:56.165
That explains the witch hazel
aftertaste.

18:56.165 --> 18:57.366
Hi.

18:57.366 --> 18:58.367
Nighty-night.

18:58.367 --> 18:59.435
Hold on-- It's 9:00 a.m.

18:59.435 --> 19:00.703
Where've you been all night?

19:00.703 --> 19:01.704
Ryan's dorm room.

19:01.704 --> 19:03.205
-What?!
-What?!

19:03.205 --> 19:04.540
We were just studying.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.208
Yeah. Right.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.711
Like I've never
used that one before.

19:08.711 --> 19:10.012
Relax.

19:10.012 --> 19:11.380
I was helping him
catch up with his classes.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.783
He's halfway through-- it's
up to him to go the distance.

19:13.783 --> 19:15.418
-Speaking of which...
-I'm not a witch!

19:15.418 --> 19:16.252
Excuse me?

19:16.252 --> 19:17.553
Sorry. I'm really tired.

19:17.553 --> 19:18.788
Did you say something?

19:18.788 --> 19:21.357
I passed my bowling final
with flying colors.

19:21.357 --> 19:23.125
That's great!
Congratulations.

19:23.125 --> 19:24.560
Yeah. I'll be able to
keep my scholarship.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.862
And you know what?
It was kind of fun
learning a new skill.

19:26.862 --> 19:28.397
I have much
to teach you.

19:28.397 --> 19:32.535
Just think of me
as your personal Yoda.

19:32.535 --> 19:35.271
Or we could
just stick with "Hey, you."

19:42.745 --> 19:43.980
Oh, hey, Roxie.
Hey, Miles.

19:43.980 --> 19:45.948
Why are you dressed
like Ray Charles?

19:45.948 --> 19:47.616
Oh, I just came
to slip into my 3:00 class

19:47.616 --> 19:48.951
and slip out with my life.

19:48.951 --> 19:50.886
That is, unless Ryan turned in
his work on time

19:50.886 --> 19:52.788
and things are back to normal.

19:52.788 --> 19:57.026
Hey, Spellman, I hope you
trip over your laptop and die.

19:57.026 --> 19:58.894
Well, at least you guys
appreciate me.

19:58.894 --> 20:00.529
It's good to know I still
have friends I can count on.

20:00.529 --> 20:01.998
We're here for
you, Sabrina.

20:01.998 --> 20:02.932
Through thick
and thin.

20:02.932 --> 20:04.867
Hey, Sabrina...

20:04.867 --> 20:05.868
We're out of here.

20:07.103 --> 20:08.004
I've got good news.

20:08.004 --> 20:09.205
I handed in
all my assignments

20:09.205 --> 20:10.439
and I get to play
on Saturday.

20:10.439 --> 20:11.574
Did everyone hear that?

20:11.574 --> 20:13.809
Ryan gets to play
in the game on
Saturday! Woo-hoo!

20:13.809 --> 20:14.744
Ow!

20:16.045 --> 20:18.314
How am I going to pitch
if I can't see?

20:18.347 --> 20:20.049
I can't believe
I lost the championship twice

20:20.049 --> 20:22.952
and it hasn't even
been played yet.

20:22.952 --> 20:24.954
I was just having
some fun with you.

20:24.954 --> 20:26.188
But to be
on the safe side--

20:26.188 --> 20:28.090
do you think you could stay
away from the field on Saturday?

20:28.090 --> 20:31.627
Yeah, anything I can do
to be a good athletic supporter.

20:32.061 --> 20:32.795
Gotta go.

20:38.223 --> 20:39.658
ANNOUNCER:
Adams leads, one to nothing.

20:39.658 --> 20:41.193
It's bottom of the ninth,
two outs.

20:41.193 --> 20:43.429
Emerson's down
to their last chance.

20:43.429 --> 20:45.164
Johnson steps up
to the plate...

20:45.164 --> 20:47.066
Go, Emerson!

20:47.066 --> 20:48.934
Knock it out of the park,
Johnson!

20:48.934 --> 20:51.203
BOTH:
No batter, no batter,
no batter-- hey!

20:51.203 --> 20:52.771
You know what I love
about baseball?

20:52.771 --> 20:55.174
It's all part of the game
to be abusive and obnoxious.

20:55.174 --> 20:57.142
You know what I like
best? The snacks.

20:57.142 --> 20:58.377
Hey, peanuts over here.

20:58.377 --> 20:59.712
( <i>Salem grunts</i> )

20:59.712 --> 21:00.813
Thanks, Salem.

21:00.813 --> 21:02.081
How can you eat legumes

21:02.081 --> 21:03.749
when there's so much
riding on this?

21:03.749 --> 21:05.117
Salem, it's just a game.

21:05.117 --> 21:06.118
To you.

21:06.118 --> 21:07.219
To me, it's the chance

21:07.219 --> 21:08.921
to become fabulously wealthy...

21:08.921 --> 21:12.091
or live as a fugitive and
have my face surgically altered.

21:12.091 --> 21:13.892
ANNOUNCER:
Johnson hits the ball deep...

21:13.892 --> 21:15.728
deep, deep to left field!

21:15.728 --> 21:17.396
Yes, yes, yes!

21:17.396 --> 21:19.765
And it's caught!
The game's over!

21:19.765 --> 21:21.000
Adams wins!
( <i>Salem sobs</i> )

21:21.000 --> 21:22.067
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

21:22.067 --> 21:23.802
( <i>gasps</i> ):
That should be Sid.

21:23.802 --> 21:25.704
And I should be booking
my plastic surgeon

21:25.704 --> 21:27.506
and the next flight
to the Cayman Islands-- Toodles.
