- Huh?

01:12.706 --> 01:16.742
Vivy dear, look who's here
to help you pack.

01:16.744 --> 01:20.045
- Hi, Vivian.
- Hi, Sofia.
Thanks for coming.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.748
Of course. I can't wait
to see your new castle.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.017
It's tremendous.
There's a swimmer's moat,

01:25.019 --> 01:28.187
three-carriage garage,
an indoor jousting court--

01:28.189 --> 01:32.024
And we've been told
it has a very enchanting garden.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.592
That would be great,

01:33.594 --> 01:36.895
if I swam or jousted
or gardened.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.898
It's never too late
to start, Vivy dear.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.533
We'll let you two
get packing.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.635
What's wrong, Vivian?

01:43.637 --> 01:46.138
Your new castle
sounds really nice.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.740
I love this castle, Sofia.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.643
I love my music room.
I don't want to move.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.746
Well, maybe your new castle
will have a music room, too.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.648
Or another room that
you like even better.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.617
Nothing could be
as great as this.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.587
It's my favorite place
in the whole world.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.722
Sometimes I spend
all day in here.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.624
It's big enough to hold
all of my instruments,

02:05.626 --> 02:07.960
and I can play them
as loud as I want.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.462
Hey, I know what
might cheer you up.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.231
Do you want to come
over for dinner?

02:12.233 --> 02:14.266
Crackle and Clover
can play together,

02:14.268 --> 02:15.801
and you won't have to
think about moving.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.736
Actually, I'd
really like that.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.673
SOFIA: Clover!
Crackle's here.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.275
Hm. I wonder where he is.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.677
CLOVER: Everybody onboard?
All right.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.713
Clover?

02:29.482 --> 02:32.251
Hold on.
Here we go.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.487
- Aha. Here you are.
- ( sprites whooping excitedly )

02:35.489 --> 02:36.922
Higher!

02:36.924 --> 02:38.690
Clover!

02:39.826 --> 02:41.026
( laughing )

02:41.028 --> 02:42.694
Oh, hey.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.164
Hey, Crackle.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.432
Can't breathe.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.801
What? I don't know
what you're saying,

02:49.803 --> 02:52.037
but I bet
it's adorable.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.106
Hey, look who's back.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.875
- Hiya, Sofia.
- Hunga bunga.

02:56.877 --> 02:57.876
Who are they?

02:57.878 --> 02:59.278
These are the wee sprites.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.679
This is my friend
Vivian.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.981
Any friend of Sofia's
is a friend of ours,

03:02.983 --> 03:04.049
so, hi, new friend.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.317
I'm Button.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.618
Brody.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.886
And I'm Bengee.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.688
Shall we give her
a wee sprite welcome?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.223
Hunga bunga!

03:16.729 --> 03:19.498
Catch us!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.166
Glad to meet ya,
Vivian.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.834
You guys are fun.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.704
Yes, when they're not
causing too much trouble.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.873
We prefer to call it
good, clean mischief.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.742
- What do you mean?
- Well, when I first met them,

03:30.744 --> 03:33.712
I let them in my castle,
and they made a huge mess.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.381
Knocked over the cake,
spilled fruit punch everywhere.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.317
They almost ruined
my mom's party.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.719
What can I say?
We like to have fun.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.721
But sometimes,
fun causes messes,

03:42.723 --> 03:45.524
and messes cause trouble,
and then everyone freaks out!

03:45.526 --> 03:47.693
So now, we live out here.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.761
Which is much better
for everyone.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.063
( bell ringing )

03:51.065 --> 03:53.498
Dinner is served,
my ladies.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.866
We better go inside.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.036
Um, Sofia, why don't
I round up Crackle and Clover,

03:58.038 --> 03:59.171
and I'll meet you in there?

03:59.173 --> 04:00.772
Okay. Thanks, Vivian.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.209
So do you guys think
you could help me out

04:04.211 --> 04:06.011
with a little problem?

04:06.013 --> 04:08.380
Oh, I'm sure we would
only make it worse.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.748
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.951
Uh, what do you
have in mind exactly?

04:12.953 --> 04:15.787
Well, my family's moving
to a new castle tomorrow,

04:15.789 --> 04:18.457
and I really, really
don't wanna move there.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.626
You think you could
make enough trouble
in this new castle

04:20.628 --> 04:22.961
that my parents would
want to turn around
and go back to our old one?

04:22.963 --> 04:25.631
Oh, you've come to
the right wee sprites.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.199
There are so many
things we could do,

04:27.201 --> 04:28.934
like we could track
mud all over the ceiling.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.236
Or fill the whole place
up with crickets.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.972
Or there's the old classic.
We could make it seem
like a haunted castle.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.708
( gasps )
Haunted. That's perfect.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.949
This one's a handful.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.752
- Hi, Vivian.
- Thanks for coming, Sofia.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.855
I'm so glad you could
help me move in today.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.591
Whoo hoo!

04:52.593 --> 04:54.493
Oh, yeah!

04:54.495 --> 04:56.728
Clover!

04:56.730 --> 05:00.565
I missed you so much
since yesterday.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.234
So can I show you around?

05:02.236 --> 05:04.836
There's a huge garden
full of flowers...

05:04.838 --> 05:09.308
and fruits
and veggies.

05:09.310 --> 05:13.512
Well, in that case,
to the garden, Crackle.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.315
I, uh, have to
check something.

05:16.317 --> 05:17.949
Go on in.
I'll be there
in a sec.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.184
Okay.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.821
Hi, guys.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.990
- Nice castle.
- I can't wait
to get inside.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.292
- After you.
- Uh, hey, would you mind

05:27.294 --> 05:29.361
- carrying us in?
- Not at all.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.896
Hop on.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.477
You can put that down
right here.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.379
BOTH: Yes, ma'am.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.480
( straining )

05:48.482 --> 05:51.550
Yeah!

05:55.822 --> 05:57.956
Hey, did you do that?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.391
No.

06:03.463 --> 06:07.966
There's something odd
about this armor,
Your Majesties.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.736
( organ begins playing )

06:15.074 --> 06:17.075
What's going on?

06:17.077 --> 06:21.146
It looks to me like
this castle is haunted.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.215
BOTH: Haunted?!

06:26.018 --> 06:26.918
( laughing )

06:29.756 --> 06:32.924
Now, Vivian, I'm sure
there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation

06:32.926 --> 06:35.660
for all this.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.496
Maybe something happened
to the organ during the move.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.499
And the armor.
I'll call the royal repair man.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.935
But, Mom, Dad, we can't live in
a castle with ghosts.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.038
We should really go back
to our old castle right now.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.709
Vivy dear, the castle
isn't haunted.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.944
Now let's keep unpacking,
shall we?

06:56.382 --> 06:59.518
Why don't we go
see your new room?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.253
Okay.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.525
I'm, uh, right behind you.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.361
It didn't work,
you guys.

07:09.363 --> 07:10.929
You'll have to do
something bigger.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.765
Scarier.
Uh, haunt-ier.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.100
Don't worry about it.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.968
We're gonna... whooo...
ghost it up.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.804
We're on it.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.142
( sprites laughing )

07:27.046 --> 07:30.449
And this is
the new garden.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.784
Ah. And this is
a happy rabbit.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.653
Chow time.

07:36.322 --> 07:38.323
Mmm.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.958
Good?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.427
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.363
Morning, friends.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.733
Who are you?

07:48.735 --> 07:51.736
Herb. Hedgehog
and grand poobah

07:51.738 --> 07:53.972
of this here
enchanted garden.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.174
This is
an enchanted garden?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.410
Oh, yeah.
Super enchanted.

07:58.412 --> 08:01.513
And that tasty little
fruit your pal just ate

08:01.515 --> 08:03.882
is an enchanted
likenberry.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.917
It makes you swoon.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.320
Go head over heels
ga-ga

08:08.322 --> 08:10.989
for the first critter you see
after eating it.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.025
And that first
critter was me.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.727
So that means...

08:18.164 --> 08:24.603
You are my best, best,
best, best friend ever.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.805
Yeah, that's
a swoon.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.074
It's happening.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.844
Wow!

08:32.846 --> 08:34.946
It's like there's a treehouse
in the middle of your room.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.115
I always wanted
a treehouse.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.217
And look at
this amazing staircase.

08:39.219 --> 08:42.153
Whoa. Do you hear the echo
the room makes over here?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.122
I bet it would sound
really great

08:44.124 --> 08:46.224
if you played
your mandolin there.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.126
Hmm.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.831
It sounds like
a whole orchestra.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.499
This room is amazing.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.368
It is pretty great.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.504
But it's not as great
as my old music room.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.072
( loud shrieks )

09:01.074 --> 09:02.874
What could that be?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.242
You carry it.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.478
Uh-uh. It's haunted.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.680
Gentlemen,
nothing is haunted.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.148
Is it the ghosts again?

09:10.150 --> 09:11.483
BOTH: Yes.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.585
- BOTH: No.
- Yes!

09:16.355 --> 09:19.190
You know, I wouldn't
be surprised

09:19.192 --> 09:20.392
if all the pictures
on the walls

09:20.394 --> 09:22.527
just suddenly
came to life.

09:22.529 --> 09:26.364
There are some
scary-looking people up there.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.167
CECILY: The paintings are not
going to suddenly come to life.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.002
I don't know, Mom.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.505
Anything can happen
in a haunted castle.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.574
I want to be small.

09:40.346 --> 09:44.583
- Aha! I thought
I saw you guys.
- Sofia!

09:44.585 --> 09:47.085
- What are you doing here?
- Vivian brought us in.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.521
BRODY: To make it seem like
the castle's haunted.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.790
BUTTON: She wants us
to cause trouble.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.525
How cool is that?

09:53.527 --> 09:55.594
I could stay here forever.
You think we could?

09:55.596 --> 09:57.929
Wait. Vivian brought
you into this castle?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.065
- Yep.
- And we're just
getting warmed up.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.734
We're about to bring on
some serious tomfoolery.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.969
Oh, no.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.239
Crackle, do you know
how much I like you?

♪ I like you so much ♪

11:12.439 --> 11:16.074
♪ So much ♪

11:22.381 --> 11:24.849
Can't breathe.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.652
What was that, Crackle?
I can't understand you,

11:27.654 --> 11:29.354
but I'm sure
whatever you said,

11:29.356 --> 11:32.223
- it was adorable.
- Herb.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.159
What can I
do ya for?

11:34.161 --> 11:35.860
Is there anything
in your garden

11:35.862 --> 11:37.962
that'll undo the effects
of the likenberry?

11:37.964 --> 11:39.397
Make him not
like me so much,

11:39.399 --> 11:41.299
like a don't likenberry?

11:41.301 --> 11:44.803
Oh, yeah, there's a berry
that'll make him normal again.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.538
Oh, phew.
What is it?

11:46.540 --> 11:49.641
- A bluesberry.
- Great. Where is it?

11:49.643 --> 11:51.609
Somewhere
over there.

11:53.345 --> 11:57.215
Or over there.
Maybe over there.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.717
It's a big garden.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.652
Just look for
a totally bluish bush.

12:00.654 --> 12:03.221
You can't miss it,
if you can find it.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.290
Oh.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.833
Clover, I need
some space.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.701
Imagine there's
a bubble around me,

12:16.703 --> 12:20.271
and you have to stay
on the outside of it.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.041
Pop.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.410
I think I'm gonna
need more help.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.281
I want to be big again.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.721
- Vivian.
- Where'd you go, Sofia?

12:36.723 --> 12:39.891
You brought wee sprites
into this castle?

12:39.893 --> 12:42.427
Yeah. They're going
to get my parents to leave.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.195
This is serious, Vivian.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.464
Inviting them in
was a big mistake.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.199
Once you let
wee sprites in,

12:48.201 --> 12:50.401
it's almost impossible
to get them out.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.103
That's okay with me.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.272
They can stay, as long
as they get my parents to go.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.474
Vivian, I know
how you feel,

12:56.476 --> 12:58.409
but this isn't
a good way to
deal with it.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.611
What do you mean?

12:59.613 --> 13:01.412
When my mom and I
moved to the castle,

13:01.414 --> 13:04.582
I had to leave my room,
my house, my friends.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.485
I had to leave
so many things that I loved.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.287
I was sad, and I was
scared, too.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.322
- You were?
- Yes.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.491
Because everything
was new and different.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.326
But just because
something's new

13:15.328 --> 13:16.561
doesn't mean
it can't be great.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.530
I don't know, Sofia.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.335
Sofia, I need your help.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.838
Clover ate a likenberry
in the enchanted garden,

13:26.840 --> 13:28.973
and it made him go
completely totally

13:28.975 --> 13:30.408
goo-goo ga-ga for me.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.310
Hold me closer, Crackle.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.979
- Closer.
- See? Herb
the hedgehog said

13:34.981 --> 13:36.948
a bluesberry will
turn him back to normal,

13:36.950 --> 13:40.485
so I really, really
need your help to find one...

13:40.487 --> 13:42.520
as soon as possible.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.322
What's wrong
with Crackle?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.158
I don't know, but I think
she wants to show us something.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.698
Wow. This is
a pretty garden.

13:58.137 --> 14:01.639
Let's spread out.
Look for a bush
that's all blue.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.542
I'm comin' with you.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.611
I know you are.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.788
Sofia, look.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.827
Wow!

14:22.829 --> 14:25.430
( both giggling )

14:28.167 --> 14:30.201
( musical tone plays )

14:30.203 --> 14:31.469
Watch this.

14:35.007 --> 14:38.943
( musical tones playing )

14:41.714 --> 14:44.716
My dad said this place
had an enchanting garden,

14:44.718 --> 14:46.818
but it's actually
enchanted.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.053
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's true.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.226
Oh, Crackle?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.495
What is it, Clover?

14:57.497 --> 14:59.530
Looking for this?

14:59.532 --> 15:01.165
( gasps )
The bluesberry bush!

15:01.167 --> 15:04.936
Yeah. Anything
for my Crackle.

15:06.605 --> 15:09.073
This is all
so incredible.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.109
( flowers singing )

15:11.111 --> 15:13.511
And there's even
a cute little hedgehog.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.513
I love this garden.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.048
- You do?
- Uh-huh.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.617
And your bedroom
was pretty great,
too, wasn't it?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.886
It was.
It really was.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.789
So maybe you could
like living here after all?

15:24.791 --> 15:27.592
Well, it's not
my old castle.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.595
I mean, it's different,
that's for sure.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.897
But good different.

15:32.899 --> 15:36.634
So, yeah, I think
I could like it here.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.102
( screaming )

15:38.104 --> 15:39.537
- Uh-oh.
- What now?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.208
- We'll be right back.
- It's okay. We found 'em.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.177
Yeah, we did.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.454
Ugh! I don't know
what came over me then,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.790
but it's never
gonna happen again, 'kay?

15:58.792 --> 16:01.426
Ah, that's my Clover.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.962
Bubble space, Crackle.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.663
Bubble space.
Respect the bubble.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.732
( sighs )
Okay.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.568
The chandelier.
Look at it.

16:15.407 --> 16:19.610
Vivian! I'm so sorry
we didn't believe you before.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.513
We will leave immediately.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.515
No, wait. I want
to stay now.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.986
We can't stay.
The castle is... haunted!

16:27.988 --> 16:29.520
No, no, it's not.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.589
It's only wee sprites.
Look.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.292
Wee sprites?
Wee sprites!

16:34.294 --> 16:38.162
I asked them to make it seem
like the castle was haunted

16:38.164 --> 16:39.764
so we wouldn't
have to live here.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.866
But now I want
to live here.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.602
You brought wee sprites
into this castle?

16:44.604 --> 16:47.105
- Uh-huh.
- That's even worse

16:47.107 --> 16:50.274
than the castle
being haunted!

16:50.276 --> 16:51.709
What do you mean?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.544
I tried to tell you
before, Vivian.

16:53.546 --> 16:57.348
Once you let wee sprites
in, it's really hard
to get them out.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.283
Pack everything up,
gentlemen.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.551
We're moving back.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.388
Right away,
Your Majesty.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.922
Go, go.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.194
Wait! Mom, Dad.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.562
I can get them
to leave.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.231
( sprites laughing )

17:13.233 --> 17:14.832
Hunga bunga.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.968
Mission accomplished.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.569
Oh, did you see them
run outta here?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.973
Guys, guys, you did
a really great job.

17:21.975 --> 17:23.674
Great job.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.243
But it turns out
I want to live here,

17:25.245 --> 17:26.911
so since we're friends
and all,

17:26.913 --> 17:29.580
would you do me a big favor
and leave... now?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.849
Oh, no can do.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.752
We're havin'
way too much fun.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.488
Yeah. I can't wait
to see what we do next.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.923
Oh, I know.
I know.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.025
Let's make sugar angels
in the kitchen.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.494
Isn't there some way
to get them out?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.763
You have to make them
say they want to leave,

17:45.765 --> 17:47.732
which they never want to do.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.334
Well, I've got to try.

17:50.336 --> 17:53.738
Sofia, Clover ate
the bluesberry,

17:53.740 --> 17:56.941
and now, he's back to
his grumpy, wonderful self.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.776
No more hugs,
no more clinging,

17:58.778 --> 18:00.344
no more following
my every move.

18:00.346 --> 18:03.648
Vivian, I think I know
how to get the wee sprites out.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.618
Just get the wee sprites
to eat these likenberries,

18:07.620 --> 18:09.520
and I'll take care
of the rest.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.290
But how will eating
berries get them out
of the castle?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.792
They're enchanted berries.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.035
Ho! Ha ha ha!

18:24.037 --> 18:27.271
Oh, whoa! Watch!

18:28.307 --> 18:29.974
Hi there.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.712
Are you gonna try
and make us leave again?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.248
No. I just wanted
to thank you guys

18:37.250 --> 18:38.449
for helping me out.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.651
We love thanking.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.753
And I brought you
a thank-you gift.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.455
We love gifts.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.457
Great. Then these
are for you.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.826
- Fresh from the garden.
- Thanks.

18:53.599 --> 18:54.799
Hi, guys.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.836
Princess Sofia.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.438
You're...

19:00.440 --> 19:03.741
...the best person
we've ever met.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.110
Hunga bunga.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.411
Thank you.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.680
You know what I want
more than anything?

19:09.682 --> 19:11.182
- What?
- Tell us.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.783
We'll get it for you.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.687
I want to leave the castle
and go for a long walk.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.788
Doesn't that sound nice?

19:17.790 --> 19:20.791
It sounds tremendous.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.360
Let's do it.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.961
Anything for you.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.464
So you want to leave
the castle with me?

19:26.466 --> 19:30.168
ALL: We want to leave
the castle with you.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.142
There you are.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.811
Now can we walk
near you?
I mean, with you?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.380
It worked.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.783
Mom, Dad, Sofia and I
got the wee sprites
out of the castle.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.853
- You did?
- Look.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.623
- BENGEE: Oh, Sofia,
- BUTTON: I love walking
with you.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.393
BRODY: I hope
it never ends.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.361
Well, if you got
the wee sprites out,

19:57.363 --> 19:59.730
I guess we can
live here after all.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.132
Right, Marcus?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.366
Quite right,
Cecily, dear.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.702
Everything back inside,
gentlemen.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.738
- BOTH: Again?
- ( exhausted sigh )

20:09.474 --> 20:11.809
Mom, Dad,
I'm so sorry

20:11.811 --> 20:13.878
I tried to ruin
the move.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.179
It's okay, Vivian.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.081
We understand
how you feel.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.483
It's hard to leave
someplace you love.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.919
It is, but I'm going
to be okay here.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.821
More than okay.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.923
Remember that garden
you told me about?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.725
Turns out it's
enchanted.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.161
You mean enchanting,
don't you, dear?

20:30.163 --> 20:32.830
No. Enchanted,
as in magical.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.432
You have to see it.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.833
- Oh.
- Very well then.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.937
Where's the bluesberry
bush, Mr. Hedgehog?

20:39.939 --> 20:42.106
That is a good question.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.975
Over here, Sof.

20:47.379 --> 20:50.514
Yeah!
Hunga bunga.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.116
You have to try
these blues-berries.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.751
They're delicious.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.454
If you love 'em,
I love 'em.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.189
Save some for me.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.625
Hunga bunga.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.033
Whoa!
What happened?

21:09.035 --> 21:11.535
You tricked us somehow,
didn't you?

21:11.537 --> 21:13.971
Were those likenberries
you gave us in there?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.940
Sorry. I had to get you
out of the castle.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.808
But we can still
play in the garden.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.778
You are a very
tricky princess,
you know that?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.213
Yeah.
( giggles)

21:22.215 --> 21:23.914
It's like I told
you, Dad.

21:23.916 --> 21:27.251
It's not just enchanting.
It's enchanted.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.387
I have an idea.
Let's have a garden party.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.955
All right!

21:30.957 --> 21:32.456
- Sounds fun.
- Garden party!

21:39.765 --> 21:44.068
( happy tune playing )

21:57.983 --> 22:01.252
Respect the bubble.
Respect the bubble.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.712
This garden is definitely
my favorite place in the castle.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.047
In fact, it could be
my new favorite place

22:30.049 --> 22:31.916
in the whole world.
