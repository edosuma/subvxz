02:27.720 --> 02:30.280
Oh, no. Not again.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.040
Not again.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.920
Dad, please.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.080
Not again.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.880
No no.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.000
Not again.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.400
No no.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.600
Not again.

02:46.680 --> 02:50.160
Dad, please.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.160
- Not again.
- She says it hurts.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.360
No, it just makes
a lot of noise.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.720
You've gotta hold on
for another minute, baby.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.920
Not again.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.640
Not again.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.280
Not again.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.080
Not again.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.200
Not again.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.320
Not again.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.680
I want the red crayon!
I want the red crayon!

03:48.760 --> 03:50.160
I want
the red crayon!

03:50.200 --> 03:53.800
I want the red crayon!
I want the red crayon!

03:53.840 --> 03:56.240
- What's happening?
- There must be a power outage.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.280
- What the hell...
- Sarah!

03:58.360 --> 04:00.160
I want the red crayon!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.840
Sarah, everything's
going to be okay.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.960
- We're gonna get you out.
- Red crayon!

04:05.040 --> 04:07.240
- Release the bed.
- I want the red crayon!

04:07.280 --> 04:10.800
I want the red crayon!
I want the red crayon!

04:10.880 --> 04:12.880
- Don't fight us, honey.
- I want the red crayon!

04:12.960 --> 04:15.440
- Come on.
- Red crayon!

04:15.520 --> 04:19.240
Red crayon.
I want the red crayon.

04:19.279 --> 04:21.160
I want
the red crayon.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.960
I want the red crayon.
I want the red.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.960
- Okay.
- I want the red crayon. I want the red.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.520
Hey hey, here it is.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.760
I want the red.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.720
You're gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.800
Daddy's here.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.720
You'll be risking her health
if you take her home now.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.000
You can't just push
a button and get a diagnosis.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.480
It's a process of elimination.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.480
I mean, I know it's slow,

04:53.520 --> 04:55.560
but we have to go through
all the causes for her symptoms

04:55.640 --> 04:57.240
just to find out
what's actually happening.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.000
I just want her
to feel better.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.640
I don't think
there's anybody in the world

05:00.720 --> 05:02.480
who could do more for her
than we've done already.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.200
Yeah, well, have you
talked to her?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.640
Have you listened
to what she has to say,

05:05.680 --> 05:07.560
or have you just stuck her
in that damn machine?

05:07.600 --> 05:10.160
Sarah keeps repeating the same thought
over and over and over.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.320
I want
the red crayon.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.160
- Sarah?
- I want the red crayon.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.680
- I don't think we have...
- I want the red crayon.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.320
- I want the red crayon.
- Okay, sweetie. Hey hey.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.720
- I want the red crayon.
- Come on, it's okay.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.800
- It's okay.
- I'm really sorry.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.800
The problems we've had
with our equipment lately...

05:37.880 --> 05:40.160
I'm sure this all must be
very exhausting for you.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.960
Have you considered
taking her to an institution?

05:42.040 --> 05:43.720
Especially now that...

05:43.760 --> 05:45.480
I've considered taking
her to another hospital.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.320
You should think about it.
It's a big decision.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.200
Sarah is my daughter.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.200
All decisions that
concern her are big.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Here we go.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.120
Try to get
some sleep, okay?

06:09.200 --> 06:10.920
It will do you good.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.360
No no, not again.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.040
Sleep tight, baby.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.480
Make sure
the bedbugs don't bite.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.800
Love you.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.120
I really really wanna go home.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.920
Hey. Hey, wake up.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.320
Let's get you out of here.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.920
Let's take you somewhere
where they'll listen to you, huh?

07:32.160 --> 07:35.240
I want the red crayon.
I want the red crayon!

07:35.280 --> 07:36.920
- Shh.
- I want the red crayon!

07:37.000 --> 07:39.360
What are you doing?

07:39.440 --> 07:42.040
Look, don't do anything
you'll regret later.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.840
I want the red crayon!

07:43.920 --> 07:46.600
Let us keep her
here for tonight.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.160
I know what's best
for my daughter.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.640
You have to believe me.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.240
If I knew a better place for her,

07:52.320 --> 07:54.040
I would take her there myself.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.720
You think you know better than me
because you have your meters

07:55.800 --> 07:57.520
and your readings.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.520
You don't really
know what's going on.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.440
Look, she doesn't
even want to leave.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.640
Your great machine
just caught on fire with her inside it.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.400
I know that,
but she needs to stay.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.760
We're trying a new drug on her.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.480
I want to sleep.
I want to dream.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.440
You'll get your own bed
in a minute, Tobias.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.200
If we stop the medication,

08:32.280 --> 08:34.480
she could develop
a more serious condition

08:34.559 --> 08:37.720
and we would have
to keep her here a lot longer.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.760
Not six, not seven,
not hell and not heaven.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.000
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah, we're all right.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.120
This elevator sure isn't.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.720
Tobias. Tobias.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.480
Quit messing around, man.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.800
Tobias?

09:18.880 --> 09:21.080
Tobias? Call for help!

09:22.640 --> 09:26.120
This is Rick, security.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.960
We're stuck in elevator 6.
We need help now.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.800
It's an emergency. Hello?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.680
Hello?

09:34.760 --> 09:37.120
This is Rick, security.
We're stuck in elevator 6.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.360
We need help now.
It's an emergency. Hello?

10:14.480 --> 10:18.160
Why wouldn't you
just let me die?

10:18.240 --> 10:20.600
Jesus Christ.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.840
Where is everyone?

10:32.920 --> 10:35.920
Is this where
the repairs are going on?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.080
No.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.400
There should be...

10:45.480 --> 10:47.760
there should be patients here...

10:49.840 --> 10:51.400
and staff.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.920
Shh.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.080
It's the air conditioning.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.240
- What?
- It's off.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.280
It was a goddamn fire drill.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.800
All right, let's take the stairs.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.720
Good.

11:19.160 --> 11:22.760
- It's locked.
- Can't you see?

11:22.840 --> 11:25.920
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.840
I'm gonna lose it here.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.000
Is there another door?

11:30.080 --> 11:31.560
The maintenance staircase
is in the other wing.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.720
Can't you see?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.360
What are we doing standing here?
Where is it?

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
Thank you.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.040
Come on, let's go.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.080
What's that noise?

12:01.520 --> 12:03.720
Why don't we just find an exit?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.240
Are all the machines
out of order today?

12:36.280 --> 12:37.840
They should have turned
them off before they left.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.840
Are you coming or not?

12:59.120 --> 13:01.160
I don't understand.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.080
Can't we just get
the hell out of here?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.840
There's no way out of here.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.040
The maintenance
staircase is open.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.160
It's just at the end
of the hall.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.160
Sarah should take
her medicine soon.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.920
- What medicine?
- Well, I was trying to tell you before.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
We're testing her
on a new drug for epilepsy.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.760
Epilepsy?

13:23.840 --> 13:25.920
Yeah, the doctors think
that might be the reason...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.080
Who gave you permission
to test this new drug on her?

13:28.160 --> 13:31.200
Well, unlike the other drug,
this drug won't damage her liver.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.800
Sure, of course.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.760
Look, if we discontinue
the use of this medication,

13:38.840 --> 13:40.440
the effects could be fatal.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.600
What is that?

13:42.680 --> 13:45.240
It's coming from over there.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.920
Excuse me, ma'am.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.800
Ma'am?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.440
What the hell is
going on here?

14:26.520 --> 14:28.200
I don't care.
It's none of our business.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.160
Let's get out of here, please.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.440
Didn't you people hear what I said?
Let's get out of here.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.840
We need to call for help.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.560
She who has
no eyes sees everything.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.600
It makes no difference.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.280
They know
where we are at all times.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.800
Stop it.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.800
Not me.
They can't see me.

14:46.880 --> 14:50.320
- Stop it.
- Not me.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.320
They can't see me.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.800
Hello?

14:53.880 --> 14:56.040
Can anyone hear me?

14:57.680 --> 14:59.240
Is anyone there?

14:59.320 --> 15:02.600
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

15:02.640 --> 15:05.240
Is anyone there?

15:06.320 --> 15:08.240
What the hell's
going on here?

15:09.640 --> 15:11.520
Why don't we all
just get out of here?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.240
Come on, let's go.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.040
After you.
You're security, you go first.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.160
Come on.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.840
We need to go down, right?
Let's go.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.400
Come on.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.960
Oh my God.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.560
What was that?

16:24.240 --> 16:26.640
Hey! Who's there?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.440
Go go go go!

16:46.160 --> 16:47.720
What the hell was that?

16:47.800 --> 16:49.040
What was that?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.720
There is only one hell.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.720
Sit down.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.520
Why? It's just a scratch.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.000
I'm going to clean you up.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.800
Oh, yeah, why don't
we make a campfire

16:59.880 --> 17:02.080
- and sing songs while we're at it?
- Hey, calm down.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.920
What, somebody's running around
tearing people's eyes out,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.960
- you want me to calm down?
- Don't pay any attention to him, honey.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.640
- Okay?
- Ben?

17:12.440 --> 17:14.720
Look, a bright light
or a loud noise can trigger a seizure.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.960
We need to stay calm.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.880
What is that?

17:44.960 --> 17:47.080
I've never heard it before.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.600
We can't stay here.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.600
We have to try
and find our way out of here.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.560
I'm not going down
those stairs again.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.520
There's an info desk
in the other wing.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.040
Let's go.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.040
Sarah, wait.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.280
Where are you going?

18:14.160 --> 18:17.160
You think the info desk people
have a solution to this?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.920
You know another way to go?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.760
- No.
- Exactly.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.880
The rain... it stopped.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.640
It's almost too quiet.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.720
The whole hospital is empty.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.600
There's not even a dial tone.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.960
Hello hello.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.320
We're in the north wing
on the fifth floor.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.360
We need some help.
I repeat... what?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.360
If there's something here
clawing people's faces,

19:10.440 --> 19:12.280
do you really want to announce
on the microphone

19:12.360 --> 19:14.680
that we're stuck on the fifth floor?

19:21.280 --> 19:23.360
Look!

19:28.760 --> 19:31.200
They're on the third floor.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.600
What the hell was that?

19:56.720 --> 19:58.360
At least we're not alone here.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.360
Who gives a shit?
Just get us out of here, will you?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.920
- I give a shit.
- Yeah, but that's your job.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Isn't anyone else wondering
where all the people are?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.280
Let's take these.
We might need them.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.720
- Do you know how to use them?
- Sure.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.160
Where's Sarah?

20:14.240 --> 20:16.400
- God damn it.
- Sarah!

20:16.480 --> 20:17.680
- Sarah?
- Sarah!

20:17.760 --> 20:18.920
Sarah!

20:20.080 --> 20:21.640
Sarah!

20:35.320 --> 20:37.240
Sarah?

20:53.440 --> 20:54.960
Sarah.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.560
Sarah.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.600
Sarah, are you okay?

20:59.680 --> 21:01.520
Sarah?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.080
Honey.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.680
You two okay?

21:05.760 --> 21:08.760
Yeah, everything's okay.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.240
Yeah.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.720
Let's just get out of here.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.840
What was in that room?

21:18.920 --> 21:21.320
- I don't know. Nothing, I guess.
- Stop, Ben.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.920
There's no time like the present.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.520
There's no time
like the present.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.480
There's no time like the present.

21:26.560 --> 21:27.720
There's no time
like the present.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.280
There's no time like the present.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.440
And it's gonna get
colder and colder.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.200
And it's gonna
get colder and colder.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.520
There's no time
like the present.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.440
And it's gonna
get colder and colder.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.920
Hello?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.600
The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.840
## The number you have d...

22:55.360 --> 22:56.840
Come on!

23:03.840 --> 23:06.840
This is not happening.
This is not happening. What was that?

23:08.680 --> 23:10.920
Go! Go!

23:55.080 --> 23:57.320
I need to switch this off.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.400
No, don't.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.040
Maybe it scared that thing off.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.880
Yeah.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.160
What the hell was that?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.880
You've seen that before, Tobias?

24:23.320 --> 24:25.240
I saw you cover your ears
before she even started,

24:25.320 --> 24:28.520
- so why was that?
- The Scream Queen.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.000
The what?

24:31.080 --> 24:33.600
You tell me.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.560
What are they doing, Ben?

24:40.240 --> 24:43.000
Why are they here, huh?

24:43.080 --> 24:45.440
You know the answer.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.440
The emptiness.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.920
This is a hospital,

25:02.960 --> 25:04.680
and they're doing some repairs.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.240
Maybe they hit a gas pipe

25:06.320 --> 25:08.400
and we're all high
and hallucinating.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.680
Hallucinating the same thing
at the same time?

25:10.760 --> 25:14.440
No, it could be that
I'm hallucinating all of this,

25:14.520 --> 25:16.000
all of you.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.960
Yeah, and you're
wearing a nightgown,

25:18.040 --> 25:20.760
and we're all gonna
wake up at any minute.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.480
The X-ray.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.880
If we stay here for too long,
we're going to be exposed to the radiation.

25:25.960 --> 25:29.240
Cancer's not going to
kill any of us.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.680
This is bullshit.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.280
- You don't want to go out there.
- This is bullshit.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.840
This is just some mass psychosis.
A body with no eyes?

25:37.920 --> 25:39.520
But we all saw it,
God damn it.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.320
Yes, we did,

25:42.400 --> 25:46.200
but it's time to use
a little common sense.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.600
Fool.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.880
I think the rest of us
should stay together.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.560
So what do we do now?

26:25.640 --> 26:28.200
Keep the X-ray machine on
and wait for help.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.480
When is Sarah supposed
to take her medication?

26:32.560 --> 26:35.320
Soon.

26:35.400 --> 26:38.040
What happens
if she doesn't get it?

27:55.440 --> 27:56.720
Help!

27:56.800 --> 27:59.760
Help! Help!

27:59.840 --> 28:01.600
- What was that?
- Jon!

28:08.880 --> 28:11.400
Help! Get me out of here!

28:13.600 --> 28:16.720
Open the door!

28:22.280 --> 28:24.640
Come on, get me out!
Get me out!

28:53.520 --> 28:56.200
To die...

28:56.240 --> 28:59.240
is beautiful.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.160
- Watch out!
- Hurry.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.400
Shit.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.920
Yeah.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.040
Perfect girl.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.000
Tobias, what are you doing?

29:40.080 --> 29:43.320
It doesn't hurt.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.280
Dying's easy.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.400
Stop it.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.200
Stop.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.040
You don't know
what you're doing.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.520
Oh, I know what I'm doing.

29:54.600 --> 29:58.360
I know it 100 times over.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.040
Tobias...

30:02.120 --> 30:06.240
I promise you will sleep.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.480
Do you know...

30:16.560 --> 30:19.160
how it feels

30:19.240 --> 30:21.800
when it's cold?

30:24.040 --> 30:26.880
When it's really

30:26.960 --> 30:28.760
really cold?

30:45.160 --> 30:47.240
He looks okay.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.000
Let's pull him out.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.920
Okay, I got him.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Come on, hang in there.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.440
Hang on! I got it!

31:30.120 --> 31:32.320
What the hell did this?

31:36.880 --> 31:38.840
It's all falling apart.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.880
Everything's falling apart.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.640
Sarah, are you feeling okay?

31:50.720 --> 31:53.360
Have you seen that?

31:53.440 --> 31:56.320
- Have you?
- No.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.280
I want the red crayon.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.640
I want the red crayon.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.600
Just as soon
as we get home, honey.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.280
How are you feeling?

32:14.360 --> 32:17.040
It hurts like hell.
That frickin' rent-a-cop

32:17.120 --> 32:18.960
and his sidekick hit me.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.520
You know, you should be thankful
your head's still on your shoulders.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.920
You almost got us killed.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.640
Me?

32:27.720 --> 32:29.960
If you didn't have to drag
that retarded kid around with us,

32:30.040 --> 32:32.200
we might be out
of here already.

32:32.280 --> 32:34.360
- Is this real, huh?
- Hey!

32:34.440 --> 32:36.880
- Christ!
- Stop it!

32:36.960 --> 32:40.120
Mass psychosis, huh?

32:40.200 --> 32:43.280
Somebody has
to take control of the situation.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.280
No, this situation
can't be controlled.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.640
- Not by you, not by anybody.
- Not by you either.

32:48.720 --> 32:51.920
No.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.360
Shh.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.200
It's the intercom.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.640
I think I've heard that before.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.880
You should know
what that is.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.240
Hello, is anyone there?

33:32.880 --> 33:34.400
Hello?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.600
- Hello?
- Hello?

33:36.680 --> 33:38.560
Hello, what floor are you on?

33:42.640 --> 33:44.640
- We're on the third floor.
- What floor?

33:44.720 --> 33:47.920
What floor?

33:50.000 --> 33:51.120
Hello?

33:51.200 --> 33:53.320
I'm coming.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.960
Well, at least
we know we're not alone.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.360
Oh, yeah, a lot of good
that's gonna do us

34:04.440 --> 34:06.840
if we're all in the same shit.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.560
Let's find them.
Come on.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.600
Oh, what the hell?

34:37.360 --> 34:39.360
They've blocked this exit.

34:53.679 --> 34:57.080
Come on, Rambo.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.600
Do something useful.
Find us a real way out.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.880
You wanted out.

35:08.320 --> 35:10.640
A staircase is behind this?

35:10.720 --> 35:13.760
Yeah, I think so.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.680
So much for that.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.480
We have to go.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.400
Come on.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.960
What the hell happened here?

36:16.040 --> 36:19.040
What in God's world
happened here?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.680
Walter! No!

36:25.280 --> 36:27.000
Walter?

36:43.160 --> 36:45.400
The only sensible solution

36:45.480 --> 36:47.280
is to give up the girl...

36:47.360 --> 36:51.040
give up the girl...
give up the girl...

36:51.120 --> 36:53.800
give up the girl... give up the girl.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.680
It's up to you.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.600
It's all up to you.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.880
Let's go.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.240
Nobody survived.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.200
- Tobias, come on!
- Let's go! Go!

38:30.280 --> 38:33.200
- Ben!
- Take her.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.920
Let's go.

39:00.840 --> 39:04.280
- Go!
- Come on, get out of there!

39:06.160 --> 39:07.680
- Go on!
- No!

39:15.840 --> 39:17.680
Why did he have
to be a goddamn hero?

39:17.760 --> 39:19.240
Nobody asked him to be...

39:19.320 --> 39:21.640
- It's your fault!
- Get off of me.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.360
Come on, calm down.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.360
Looks clear.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.920
They want the girl,
you know.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.280
- How do you know that?
- Isn't it obvious?

40:06.320 --> 40:08.520
The ghost,
the old man's stories, the tapes.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.320
You're starting to believe this.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.560
You could get us
killed if you don't...

40:12.640 --> 40:15.000
You think I'm gonna
let them kill my daughter to save you?

40:15.080 --> 40:16.560
And yourself,

40:16.640 --> 40:19.600
and the nurse.
What if the old man was right?

40:19.680 --> 40:23.440
What if it all depends on you?

40:49.440 --> 40:51.760
What's happening?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.760
Hello?

41:16.720 --> 41:19.760
- Hello?
- What floor are you on?

41:19.840 --> 41:21.680
We're on the third floor.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.640
- What floor are you on?
- We're on...

41:34.640 --> 41:37.280
Why did you hang up?

41:37.360 --> 41:39.520
It was me.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.960
What do you mean
it was you?

41:43.920 --> 41:45.880
It was the same call
I made earlier.

41:58.960 --> 42:02.320
There has to be
some explanation for this.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.880
Maybe an echo.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.840
Maybe you accidentally
recorded something.

42:05.920 --> 42:08.000
No.

42:09.280 --> 42:12.000
Maybe it's some kind of
parallel-dimension thing,

42:12.080 --> 42:14.240
you know?

42:14.320 --> 42:15.840
Like one world
on top of the other.

42:17.320 --> 42:19.960
My watch has stopped.
All the clocks have stopped.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.360
What does that mean?

42:21.440 --> 42:22.880
I don't know what it means,
but time has stopped.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.880
- It's not moving, look.
- How can time stop?

42:25.960 --> 42:28.040
I don't know.

42:31.760 --> 42:34.280
Sarah, what is it?

42:34.320 --> 42:36.000
She needs to take
her medicine.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.160
- Well, where can we get it?
- In the emergency room,

42:38.240 --> 42:40.680
but it's behind
that blocked wall.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.560
You stay here.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.200
We'll clear that wall.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.960
Even if you do get out of here,

42:53.040 --> 42:54.440
what are you going
to do if time stopped?

42:54.480 --> 42:56.680
Right now I just want
to get my child the hell out of here,

42:56.760 --> 42:59.160
- so I'll worry about that later.
- Oh! Ow!

42:59.240 --> 43:00.800
Sarah, everything's
gonna be okay.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.560
Daddy's gonna get
you out of here, okay?

43:05.440 --> 43:08.080
Will you watch her?

43:08.160 --> 43:10.400
If you even lay a finger on her,

43:10.480 --> 43:13.800
you won't live to regret it.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.760
No.

43:18.840 --> 43:22.480
No. No.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.800
I think that's
the fastest way down.

43:39.920 --> 43:43.240
Have you... seen Sarah's drawings?

43:43.320 --> 43:47.200
Yeah, I've seen a lot of them.

43:47.280 --> 43:50.000
What do you make of them?

43:51.240 --> 43:53.920
I think she knows
something we don't.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.760
Don't you start with that.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.520
Ben, when you were gone,

43:57.600 --> 43:59.720
I heard Sarah speak
with Tobias.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.320
I didn't hear what she said,

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
but she spoke clearly
and didn't repeat herself.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.280
She's just a little girl.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.440
Why does everyone keep saying
she's the reason for this?

44:08.520 --> 44:10.320
And what if she is?

44:10.400 --> 44:13.280
I touched Tobias's hand.
It was cold.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.920
It was like he was dead.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.800
What's this?

44:49.360 --> 44:52.120
Sand.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.880
Guns haven't really helped.

45:03.920 --> 45:05.720
Yeah, well, you never know.

45:24.920 --> 45:26.680
What are you drawing?

45:31.040 --> 45:33.640
It's okay.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.840
You don't wanna show me.

45:35.920 --> 45:39.240
That's okay. It's okay.

45:50.480 --> 45:53.160
You know Sarah's
gonna be okay.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.800
Do you have children?

45:56.880 --> 45:58.640
I have a boy.

45:58.720 --> 46:01.880
- He's four.
- And the father?

46:03.760 --> 46:06.080
I haven't seen him
in a couple of years.

46:06.160 --> 46:09.160
I'm sorry.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.760
Don't be.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.280
He wasn't the kind
f man who would...

46:40.360 --> 46:42.920
- What was that?
- I don't know.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.440
This... what the hell?

46:51.520 --> 46:54.360
This is Jon's.

46:54.440 --> 46:55.920
He dropped them.
Remember?

46:56.000 --> 46:57.640
Hey, wait.

46:57.680 --> 46:59.520
- Stop, I need to tell them.
- No, don't you get it?

46:59.600 --> 47:01.320
It was me.
I just shot Rick in the head.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.800
What do you think
they'd say if they saw you?

47:26.800 --> 47:28.840
Come on.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.800
Why don't you and I take...

47:31.880 --> 47:33.960
a little walk?

47:35.920 --> 47:38.200
We'll have a lot of fun.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.840
Shh.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.720
What?

48:19.760 --> 48:23.240
Did you hear that?

48:51.560 --> 48:52.960
What the hell is that?

49:26.720 --> 49:28.680
Come and get her!

49:31.840 --> 49:34.560
You can take her.

49:36.120 --> 49:38.720
You can have her!

49:38.800 --> 49:41.280
Come and get her!

49:41.360 --> 49:44.960
We just want to get out.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.520
She's here.
You can have her.

49:47.600 --> 49:51.040
She's not yours to give away.

50:00.560 --> 50:02.520
What if it really is true?

50:02.600 --> 50:04.960
What?

50:05.040 --> 50:07.400
If I don't give them Sarah,
this is never gonna stop.

50:07.440 --> 50:09.880
If they wanted Sarah,
why didn't they just take her?

50:15.080 --> 50:17.160
Hello?

50:18.880 --> 50:21.680
- Hello?
- The teddy bear man...

50:21.760 --> 50:23.840
Sarah!

50:23.920 --> 50:25.120
Tobias. How did...

50:25.200 --> 50:26.960
Sarah.

50:35.440 --> 50:38.880
You... you're one of them.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.600
Have you ever been cold?

50:44.680 --> 50:47.240
I mean really really cold?

50:47.280 --> 50:49.080
What the...

51:04.200 --> 51:06.440
Cold enough for you?

51:11.920 --> 51:15.000
Sarah! Sarah!

51:30.640 --> 51:32.120
Here she is!

52:05.120 --> 52:06.360
Sarah!

52:45.320 --> 52:46.480
Hey!

52:57.040 --> 52:58.560
No no.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.320
- No.
- Sarah?

53:00.360 --> 53:02.640
- No no no.
- Sarah.

53:02.720 --> 53:05.040
- No.
- Everything's okay.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.080
- Who is that?
- Ben.

53:13.160 --> 53:15.280
Is he dead?

53:15.360 --> 53:18.480
It's like he's been
dead for a week.

53:18.560 --> 53:21.840
We have to go.

53:23.360 --> 53:25.280
Yeah.

53:47.400 --> 53:50.400
We should be able to get
to the ground floor from here.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.480
Okay.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.040
Take the chair.

54:17.360 --> 54:19.760
No, not there.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.800
No no, not there.

54:22.880 --> 54:25.040
Not there.

54:28.560 --> 54:29.960
Do you know how
to get out of here?

54:30.040 --> 54:33.160
No no.

54:33.240 --> 54:35.440
Can you draw it for me?

54:35.520 --> 54:38.840
No no.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.040
This way.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.120
Yeah.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.440
I think we can find
Sarah's medicine in here.

55:22.560 --> 55:25.640
- You find it?
- No.

55:25.680 --> 55:27.080
Could you check that one?

55:30.960 --> 55:33.600
Could there be some other way
out through the garage?

55:33.680 --> 55:36.480
Yeah, the staff go through
the morgue to get to the garage,

55:36.560 --> 55:39.160
even though the chief
tells them not to.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.400
Well, maybe the chief
will make an exception.

55:41.480 --> 55:43.240
Oh, shit.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.640
Sarah?

55:48.160 --> 55:50.200
Look.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.280
Well, she can't have gone far.

55:53.320 --> 55:55.000
You check over there.
I'll check this way.

55:55.080 --> 55:57.200
- Keep your walkie-talkie on.
- Okay.

56:00.640 --> 56:02.720
Sarah!

56:06.000 --> 56:09.080
Sarah? Sarah!

56:20.680 --> 56:22.440
Ben?

56:22.520 --> 56:24.400
Can you hear me?

56:24.480 --> 56:26.480
Ben.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.200
Emily?

56:46.280 --> 56:48.880
Talk to me.
Where are you?

57:34.480 --> 57:36.080
Ben!

57:54.360 --> 57:56.880
Excuse me.

57:59.280 --> 58:02.080
I need help.

58:06.520 --> 58:09.040
Excuse me, can you help me?

58:12.240 --> 58:15.200
Can anybody please help me?

58:15.240 --> 58:18.800
Excuse me.

58:18.880 --> 58:20.760
Where's my daughter?

58:39.400 --> 58:41.680
Sarah!

58:41.760 --> 58:45.400
Ben, can you hear me?

58:45.480 --> 58:47.680
Ben, where are you?

58:47.760 --> 58:50.280
I don't know.
There were people, and they...

58:50.320 --> 58:52.440
What? Where?

58:52.520 --> 58:54.880
The emergency room,
but Sarah's not there.

58:54.920 --> 58:56.920
Where are you?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.360
I'm outside room 235.

58:59.400 --> 59:02.240
Okay, I'm coming.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.360
I can't hear you.

59:12.400 --> 59:15.080
I'm standing right in front
of room 235.

59:15.120 --> 59:18.960
You must be in
a different hallway.

59:19.040 --> 59:22.560
Ben, there's only one 235
in this hospital.

59:22.600 --> 59:26.520
There's a teddy bear
poster beside it.

59:28.640 --> 59:30.120
Ben?

59:34.120 --> 59:35.360
Ben.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.160
Ben?

59:43.280 --> 59:45.560
Ben? Ben?

59:52.080 --> 59:55.160
Ben, can you hear me?

59:55.240 --> 59:57.680
I found Sarah.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.520
She's...

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.600
Finally.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.880
Not that way.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.080
Sarah.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.640
Where are you going?

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.960
It has to stop.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.880
What are you talking about?

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.760
Ben!

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.240
What happened?

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.720
I don't know.
There were these people,

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.080
but it was like
they couldn't see me or something.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.840
Ben?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.840
Come on, Sarah.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.000
It's okay.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.400
We're gonna get you
out of here soon.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.440
What the hell?

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.400
Emily.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.440
Emily, come on.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.440
No, take Sarah.
You can come back for me later.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.200
No, that is not going
to happen. Come on.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.800
Okay.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.440
No.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.440
We need to get out of here!

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.480
Rest, okay?

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.800
- Just try to hold on, baby.
- She's slipping into a coma.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.440
Through those doors
we can get to the garage.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.080
Come on, let's go.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.400
Ben!

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.720
Emily! Emily!

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.280
Open the door!

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.680
Hurry!

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.440
It's okay.
We're gonna get you out of there.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.360
You need to open the door!

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.880
- Ben, Ben, Ben.
- It's okay.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.360
Please please. Open it.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.640
- No.
- No. No!

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.240
It's coming.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.960
It's coming.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.440
It's here. It's here!

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.040
Sarah, what's here?

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.560
Try to hold on, baby!

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:18.120
Sarah, are you all right?

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.720
Again and again and again

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.080
and again.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.480
How in the hell
do we get out of here?

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.920
Oh no no

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.160
no no no!

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.600
This can't
be happening.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.720
Everyone will die.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.560
What happens will happen.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.439
Sarah, please!

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:19.720
If you know how to stop this, do it.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.920
What happens will happen.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.479
What happens will happen.

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:50.359
Come on.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.000
Okay. Okay.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.160
It's not your fault.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.960
It's not.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.280
It's not your fault.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.880
You stay here, okay?

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.880
Someone will come
and get you.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.920
Hey.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.000
Good night, baby.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.000
Sleep tight.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.840
Don't let those bedbugs bite.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.200
I love you.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.280
Somebody will come
and get you.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.520
Sarah?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.880
Sarah?

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.480
What are you doing?

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.080
No.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.360
Try to hold on
for another minute, baby.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:41.280
No, not anymore.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.800
I'd like to go home now.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.600
You don't understand.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.200
Light can't live in darkness.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.040
No, you're not going to do that.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.400
Sarah, I don't feel cold anymore.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.800
# Something's moving,
swarming under rugs #

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.240
# Cold flesh cozy home
for worms and bugs #

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.480
# Their children,

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.080
