WEBVTT

00:00.626 --> 00:02.942
PRUE:
All right, I know
that it seems like

00:03.042 --> 00:04.818
she's being a little neurotic,

00:04.918 --> 00:06.567
but high school was
hard for her.

00:06.667 --> 00:08.359
Really,
really hard.

00:08.459 --> 00:08.994
You know, she was

00:09.004 --> 00:11.899
kind of like Jan Brady--
the middle sister,

00:11.999 --> 00:14.150
not quite sure
where she fits in?

00:14.250 --> 00:14.859
Jan who?

00:14.959 --> 00:16.983
Hmm.
PIPER:
Okay, ready or not,

00:17.083 --> 00:17.651
here I come.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.959
Okay, no matter what,
just be supportive.

00:27.501 --> 00:28.651
Wow.

00:28.751 --> 00:29.942
Uh, you look great.

00:30.042 --> 00:31.609
LEO:
Really, really,

00:31.709 --> 00:32.234
really great.

00:32.334 --> 00:35.626
Leo, two reallys would
have been plenty.

00:35.999 --> 00:37.567
I look ridiculous.

00:37.667 --> 00:38.275
No!
No!

00:38.375 --> 00:39.692
I mean, the feathers...

00:39.792 --> 00:40.692
Really.

00:40.792 --> 00:41.484
Um...
Yeah.

00:41.584 --> 00:43.899
Great. I'm going to go
to my ten-year reunion

00:43.999 --> 00:48.334
and win "most likely to scare
people away at the door."

00:49.959 --> 00:52.234
Come on Piper, isn't
this supposed to be

00:52.334 --> 00:53.401
a fun thing?

00:53.501 --> 00:54.484
You know, going back

00:54.584 --> 00:56.025
and seeing all
your old friends?

00:56.125 --> 00:57.067
You weren't by any chance

00:57.167 --> 00:58.942
popular in high school,
were you?

00:59.042 --> 01:00.651
Well, I was...

01:00.751 --> 01:01.734
I mean...

01:01.834 --> 01:04.959
Is there a right answer
to this question?

01:05.626 --> 01:06.899
Leo, I didn't like
high school,

01:06.999 --> 01:07.942
not even a little bit.

01:08.042 --> 01:09.818
I was nobody in high school.

01:09.918 --> 01:12.899
Piper, you were not a nobody.

01:12.999 --> 01:14.150
Prue, you were class president.

01:14.250 --> 01:17.317
You have no idea what it's
like on the other side.

01:17.417 --> 01:19.234
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.

01:19.334 --> 01:20.192
PIPER:
I had this stupid idea

01:20.292 --> 01:22.651
that I'd go back in
ten years and show them

01:22.751 --> 01:26.899
and all I'm going to show them
is that I'm a big-haired freak!

01:26.999 --> 01:28.859
All right, you do not
look like a freak.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.900
you just... you don't
look like yourself.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.859
Well, if I could go as myself,

01:32.959 --> 01:34.859
I wouldn't be having
this problem.

01:34.959 --> 01:38.609
Wait, you mean so this is
like a costume party?

01:38.709 --> 01:41.859
What I mean is I'm this
super powerful witch,

01:41.959 --> 01:43.609
who's engaged
to a whitelighter,

01:43.709 --> 01:47.484
saving the world from evil
on a daily freaking basis!

01:47.584 --> 01:50.109
And all these people
are going to see

01:50.209 --> 01:51.692
is the same pitiful loser

01:51.792 --> 01:53.692
who still lives at home
with her sisters

01:53.792 --> 01:55.751
and her unemployed boyfriend!

01:56.250 --> 01:57.067
Did you have
to put a lot

01:57.167 --> 01:58.899
of hair spray on that hair?

01:58.999 --> 01:59.526
No.

01:59.626 --> 02:01.192
Well then, all is not lost.

02:01.292 --> 02:02.609
By the time
I'm done with you,

02:02.709 --> 02:03.234
you're going to be

02:03.334 --> 02:05.067
the hottest chick
at the reunion.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.067
Really?

02:06.167 --> 02:06.734
Mm-hmm.

02:06.834 --> 02:09.109
Who do you think
helped Phoebe go blonde?

02:09.209 --> 02:10.275
Hey, uh...

02:10.375 --> 02:10.994
speaking of Phoebe,

02:11.003 --> 02:12.776
maybe you guys should
invite her to join you.

02:12.876 --> 02:14.192
She's been kind
of distant lately.

02:14.292 --> 02:15.359
Leo, when you
find out

02:15.459 --> 02:16.899
your boyfriend is a demon

02:16.999 --> 02:19.484
and then you have
to vanquish him,

02:19.584 --> 02:21.567
a little alone time is in order.

02:21.667 --> 02:24.692
Besides, I think she's
kind of avoiding me.

02:24.792 --> 02:26.899
You know, I mean
I never really liked Cole

02:26.999 --> 02:27.899
and then I tried to warn her.

02:27.999 --> 02:30.401
I think it's
a whole wounded pride thing.

02:30.501 --> 02:31.776
What do we do?

02:31.876 --> 02:32.204
We double-team.

02:32.214 --> 02:37.209
You help Phoebe with her demons,
and I will help Piper with hers.

02:38.999 --> 02:40.192
(<i>yells</i>)

02:40.292 --> 02:43.234
I made you from my own blood,

02:43.334 --> 02:44.899
found you
a flawless body

02:44.999 --> 02:46.067
and housed you in it.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.109
You were supposed
to be my...

02:48.209 --> 02:48.899
Masterpiece?

02:48.999 --> 02:50.359
I'm not a painting, Kierkan.

02:50.459 --> 02:51.818
That blood

02:51.918 --> 02:53.899
gave me your powers.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.859
Your lust for life.

02:55.959 --> 02:57.899
Yet you hold me captive
in this soul

02:57.999 --> 02:59.609
and you expect me
to be grateful?

02:59.709 --> 03:04.334
Balthazor was more powerful
than either of us.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.275
Where is he now?

03:07.375 --> 03:08.609
Vanquished.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.709
By the Charmed Ones.

03:12.626 --> 03:16.484
Is that fear I'm sensing?

03:16.584 --> 03:17.234
Is Kierkan, the dark

03:17.334 --> 03:21.751
and powerful alchemist
afraid of three little witches?

03:22.334 --> 03:23.776
Perhaps I should suck you

03:23.876 --> 03:25.818
into your little mixing bottle

03:25.918 --> 03:27.167
and start again.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.083
There's always room
for improvement.

03:31.918 --> 03:34.999
I have a better idea.

03:37.459 --> 03:39.375
No!

03:48.375 --> 03:50.542
I will find you, Terra.

03:51.375 --> 03:54.025
You belong to me!

03:54.125 --> 03:54.899
I don't care.

03:54.999 --> 03:56.899
This has to be huge and done.

03:56.999 --> 03:59.567
And done before the stock IPO's.

03:59.667 --> 04:00.899
All right, and, uh...

04:00.999 --> 04:02.942
and please tell the music guy

04:03.042 --> 04:04.899
that I don't want
to hear any more

04:04.999 --> 04:05.899
of that '90s techno crap.

04:05.999 --> 04:08.899
Okay, this is a computer game
for the new millennium.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.709
I want it
to freaking sound like that.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.999
(<i>gasps</i>)

04:21.750 --> 04:24.751
(<i>with feminine tone</i>):
Bye now.

04:29.999 --> 04:31.651
Oh, wow.

04:31.751 --> 04:34.442
I've never been a man before.

04:34.542 --> 04:38.000
Walking should be interesting.

04:39.042 --> 04:40.275
What the hell is going on?

04:40.375 --> 04:43.567
I want you to take me
to the Charmed Ones.

04:43.667 --> 04:44.818
What?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.609
The witches, you fool.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.999
They go by Halliwell.

04:49.709 --> 04:51.651
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

04:51.751 --> 04:52.692
Help me!

04:52.792 --> 04:54.150
Hey!

04:54.250 --> 04:55.150
Nice try.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.859
But nobody
can hear you.

04:57.959 --> 04:59.983
You're just a trapped soul now.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.999
Only I can see you.

05:56.876 --> 05:57.245
Mm, I don't know.

05:57.255 --> 06:00.401
Maybe we should go back
to the Betsy Johnson you know,

06:00.501 --> 06:01.275
the cool club chick look

06:01.375 --> 06:03.899
as opposed
to the classy club owner look.

06:03.999 --> 06:04.454
Yeah, or we could

06:04.464 --> 06:07.025
just wrap you in a sheet
and send you as a Hari Krishna.

06:07.125 --> 06:08.567
What do you think
about that, since we

06:08.667 --> 06:09.899
already tried
everything else?!

06:09.999 --> 06:10.859
I'm sorry!

06:10.959 --> 06:11.942
I just don't think I can do it,

06:12.042 --> 06:14.818
I can't go there and face
all those horrific people!

06:14.918 --> 06:16.942
I mean come on, why do you even
care what these people think?

06:17.042 --> 06:19.899
Only a former cheerleader
could ask that question.

06:19.999 --> 06:22.442
All right look, I realize
that high school

06:22.542 --> 06:23.609
was very hard for you,

06:23.709 --> 06:24.692
but you are
just not that

06:24.792 --> 06:26.359
shy awkward girl anymore.

06:26.459 --> 06:27.567
But...

06:27.667 --> 06:28.120
No! Now you are going,

06:28.130 --> 06:30.567
and you're going to have
a great time, young lady.

06:30.667 --> 06:31.899
You are not the boss of me.

06:31.999 --> 06:32.899
Oh, I am, too!

06:32.999 --> 06:38.859
Besides, nothing could be worse
than my date last night.

06:38.959 --> 06:39.776
What do you mean?

06:39.876 --> 06:40.567
I thought he was nice.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.900
Oh, I have one word for you--
halitosis.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.192
And he only scored a two.

06:44.292 --> 06:46.818
Oh, Prue, please don't tell me
you're making lists again.

06:46.918 --> 06:48.734
Of course I am. Lists are good.

06:48.834 --> 06:49.484
Why waste your time

06:49.584 --> 06:50.609
if it's not going to work out?

06:50.709 --> 06:52.899
Well, maybe I can look around
the reunion for you.

06:52.999 --> 06:55.899
I'm sure there's lots of
eligible ex-football players

06:55.999 --> 06:57.401
for the head

06:57.501 --> 06:58.275
cheerleader.

06:58.375 --> 06:59.442
Younger men are not

06:59.542 --> 07:01.083
on my list.

07:01.667 --> 07:04.234
Hey, have you guys
seen my glasses?

07:04.334 --> 07:05.983
No.
Sorry.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.999
Damn.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.526
Uh, Pheebes!

07:10.626 --> 07:13.734
Are you sure you don't
want to come tonight?

07:13.834 --> 07:14.776
You can work the bar

07:14.876 --> 07:17.317
and make some yucky drinks
for some ex-cheerleaders.

07:17.417 --> 07:20.734
As much fun as that sounds,
I have a ton of schoolwork

07:20.834 --> 07:21.899
that I need to catch up on,

07:21.999 --> 07:23.609
so I'm going to be at
the library all night.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.776
Phoebe, look, we just want you
to know

07:25.876 --> 07:28.859
that if you need to talk
at all, we're here.

07:28.959 --> 07:31.025
I know that. I'm okay.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.317
Really? 'Cause you haven't spent
like five minutes

07:33.417 --> 07:35.567
in the same room with us
for over a week.

07:35.667 --> 07:36.150
I'm sorry.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.899
It's just there are some things,

07:38.999 --> 07:40.401
some answers, that I need,

07:40.501 --> 07:45.275
and I sort of need to find
them for myself, you know.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.899
Soul searching?

07:46.999 --> 07:50.899
Definitely searching, yeah.

07:50.999 --> 07:51.899
But I'm okay.

07:51.999 --> 07:53.792
Don't worry about me.

07:54.417 --> 07:55.609
You look beautiful.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.899
Thanks.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.584
Have fun tonight.

08:07.999 --> 08:08.942
Piper Halliwell?

08:09.042 --> 08:11.083
You still living at home?

08:12.167 --> 08:13.900
PIPER:
Justin Harper.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.609
Is that you?

08:15.709 --> 08:17.626
Hey.
Hey.

08:18.209 --> 08:19.899
So who's this, ex-boyfriend?

08:19.999 --> 08:21.899
Oh, don't worry about him Leo.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.609
He's just a friend from school.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.942
Besides, he had
a really big crush on me.

08:26.042 --> 08:29.999
He used to follow me around
like a puppy dog.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.275
Uh, are you going
to the reunion?

08:32.375 --> 08:33.109
Oh, yeah.

08:33.208 --> 08:33.828
Nostalgia struck.

08:33.839 --> 08:36.067
Thought I'd drive around
the old neighborhood.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.899
Ten years--

08:37.999 --> 08:38.899
unbelievable.

08:38.999 --> 08:39.359
Yeah.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.442
We were just actually
heading to P3

08:41.542 --> 08:43.567
for the planning committee.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.734
We have a lot more food
than we have room for.

08:46.834 --> 08:47.899
Would you mind...?

08:47.999 --> 08:50.899
Absolutely.

08:50.999 --> 08:51.899
Great!

08:51.999 --> 08:53.484
Here you go.

08:53.584 --> 08:55.900
Look at you Justin,
all grown up.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.900
Yeah, you too.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.317
Phoebe isn't it?

08:58.417 --> 09:00.359
Prue.

09:00.459 --> 09:02.959
Prue-- right.

09:03.999 --> 09:04.899
Sorry.

09:04.999 --> 09:06.192
Well, it looks like you got

09:06.292 --> 09:07.900
all the help you need,
which is good.

09:08.000 --> 09:08.899
Because They're calling.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.899
No, you can't cut out on me.

09:10.999 --> 09:11.609
I need you tonight.

09:11.709 --> 09:14.317
I'll be back in time for
the reunion, I promise.

09:14.417 --> 09:15.942
Double extra promise.

09:16.042 --> 09:16.899
I wouldn't miss it.

09:16.999 --> 09:20.292
Going to have
the prettiest date ever.

09:29.375 --> 09:30.317
Please...

09:30.417 --> 09:31.317
look... you found them.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.150
Why don't you just
get out of me?

09:33.250 --> 09:35.692
I have to get one of them alone.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.526
The transfer's a little...

09:37.626 --> 09:39.150
(<i>chuckles</i>):
...messy.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.401
I can't do it just anywhere.

09:41.501 --> 09:42.899
Look, I'm begging you!

09:42.999 --> 09:44.942
I can't stand this anymore!

09:45.042 --> 09:45.899
I can't breathe!

09:45.999 --> 09:47.899
I feel like I'm suffocating!

09:47.999 --> 09:50.025
That's because
your soul is dying.

09:50.125 --> 09:53.459
It'll be easier
if you don't fight it.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.709
Cole, if you can hear me...

10:34.042 --> 10:36.150
I can't stand lying anymore.

10:36.250 --> 10:39.818
I have to tell my sisters
that you're alive.

10:39.918 --> 10:40.454
That I let you go.

10:40.464 --> 10:44.899
And that you would never do
anything to hurt us and...

10:44.999 --> 10:48.899
that you love me.

10:48.999 --> 10:53.275
I just don't know how to do it.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.900
I need, uh...

10:56.000 --> 10:59.584
I need, f...

11:12.209 --> 11:13.999
No!

11:38.209 --> 11:39.818
Uh, guys,
it's still crooked.

11:39.918 --> 11:42.818
Can't you see those
creases in the middle?

11:42.918 --> 11:43.204
Oh, yeah.

11:43.214 --> 11:45.692
Now just remember,
even if you can't tell them

11:45.792 --> 11:49.025
that you're super witch,
you can still act like it.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.442
Oh, my God!

11:50.542 --> 11:52.359
Missy Campbell--

11:52.459 --> 11:53.359
homecoming queen.

11:53.459 --> 11:56.192
Oh, please, that's
ancient history.

11:56.292 --> 11:57.999
You can do this.

12:04.042 --> 12:05.067
Missy,

12:05.167 --> 12:07.751
is that you?

12:08.083 --> 12:10.317
Piper... Piper Halliwell?

12:10.417 --> 12:12.359
Uh, we had, um,

12:12.459 --> 12:15.125
chem together
and Miss Fowler...

12:15.999 --> 12:17.359
for English?

12:17.459 --> 12:19.776
Right.

12:19.876 --> 12:20.900
Piper.

12:21.000 --> 12:21.899
You used to sit

12:21.999 --> 12:23.359
in the back of the class

12:23.459 --> 12:25.734
drawing pictures on your jeans.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.567
Yes, yeah, that...

12:27.667 --> 12:28.900
yep, that was me.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.942
Wow, your skin has really
cleared up!

12:33.042 --> 12:33.983
Accutane?

12:34.083 --> 12:34.900
No, no,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.734
I guess uh...
you know, ten years.

12:38.834 --> 12:39.899
Um, is there
anything

12:39.999 --> 12:41.899
I can do to help or...?

12:41.999 --> 12:45.292
Do you know what would be great?

12:45.501 --> 12:47.899
Can you get this
trash out of here?

12:47.999 --> 12:48.899
Absolutely.

12:48.999 --> 12:49.983
I... yeah, I can...

12:50.083 --> 12:51.067
I can totally do that.

12:51.167 --> 12:55.334
I-I know where the Dumpster
is and everything.

12:56.999 --> 12:58.899
All right, that's it!
She needs me!

12:58.999 --> 13:02.067
She's got to find her legs
on her own sometime.

13:02.167 --> 13:02.776
Sorry?

13:02.876 --> 13:05.442
Remember when she ran for
freshman class secretary?

13:05.542 --> 13:06.899
She got so nervous
that you had to go

13:06.999 --> 13:08.899
up on stage and finish
her speech for her.

13:08.999 --> 13:11.192
See? I knew that
you remembered me.

13:11.292 --> 13:13.067
Why did you call me Phoebe?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.442
(<i>clearing throat</i>)

13:14.542 --> 13:18.734
Listen-- you plagued my
high school existence.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.818
I pretended not
to remember your name.

13:20.918 --> 13:23.567
A guy's got to turn
the tables every, you know,

13:23.667 --> 13:24.999
ten years or so.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.999
Excuse me.

13:39.999 --> 13:41.899
I plagued your
high school existence?

13:41.999 --> 13:45.417
Please! I was your
willing slave and you know it.

13:46.709 --> 13:48.109
You did me a favor though.

13:48.209 --> 13:49.192
I did?
Mm-hmm.

13:49.292 --> 13:49.983
Oh, absolutely.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.567
See, I don't go for women

13:51.667 --> 13:52.818
like you anymore.

13:52.918 --> 13:54.651
Women like me?

13:54.751 --> 13:57.150
Well, number one on my list:

13:57.250 --> 13:59.109
no women
who make me drool.

13:59.209 --> 14:02.709
They hold way too much power.

14:03.999 --> 14:04.899
What?

14:04.999 --> 14:07.000
You have a list?

14:09.083 --> 14:10.999
Oh!

14:11.834 --> 14:12.692
Piper, what are you doing?

14:12.792 --> 14:16.317
Uh, Missy asked me
to take out the trash so...

14:16.417 --> 14:17.067
So,

14:17.167 --> 14:18.899
you own this place, all right?

14:18.999 --> 14:21.899
Tell somebody else
to take out the trash!

14:21.999 --> 14:23.734
Prue, I can't.

14:23.834 --> 14:24.526
Look, I can't explain it,

14:24.626 --> 14:27.109
but being around these people
makes me feel exactly

14:27.209 --> 14:30.734
like I did when I was sixteen--
invisible and inferior.

14:30.834 --> 14:31.899
You want me to beat them up?

14:31.999 --> 14:34.067
'Cause I'll-I'll beat
them up one by one.

14:34.167 --> 14:38.651
No. Look, it's not them.
It's just me.

14:38.751 --> 14:39.899
(<i>sighs</i>)

14:39.999 --> 14:42.818
So what are you going
to do about it?

14:42.918 --> 14:44.401
Take out the trash.

14:44.501 --> 14:44.983
Piper.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.192
Okay, I'm going to take out
the trash,

14:47.292 --> 14:47.983
and try and get a grip

14:48.083 --> 14:49.859
and then I'm going
to come back in here

14:49.959 --> 14:52.651
and do something about these
streamers and balloons,

14:52.751 --> 14:55.417
because, what, are we
still at the prom?

15:11.209 --> 15:13.626
(<i>groans</i>)

15:20.125 --> 15:21.999
(<i>gasps</i>)

15:25.584 --> 15:27.918
Oh, my God!

15:28.334 --> 15:29.899
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:29.999 --> 15:32.250
Oh!

15:38.125 --> 15:40.999
Thanks for the lift.

15:48.751 --> 15:52.125
You better be as powerful
as they say you are.

16:01.751 --> 16:04.025
Uh, help me out.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.317
What is our sister's name?

16:05.417 --> 16:06.776
If you get out of my body now,

16:06.876 --> 16:09.109
I might not have
to vanquish your sorry ass.

16:09.209 --> 16:11.999
Not as weak as you seemed
after all.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.709
That'll change.

16:15.876 --> 16:18.692
Wow, you only
scored a four.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.776
That is just so sad.

16:20.876 --> 16:21.162
Hmm, excuse me,

16:21.172 --> 16:24.109
but you only scored a five
out of ten on my list.

16:24.209 --> 16:25.818
Right, so I got an "F,"

16:25.918 --> 16:27.275
but dude,
you got an F-.

16:27.375 --> 16:31.234
Ouch, that's
a bad high school flashback.

16:31.334 --> 16:32.401
Uh-oh!

16:32.501 --> 16:33.359
Hi.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.942
Okay, hi.

16:35.042 --> 16:36.567
I don't really think
that that's the best way

16:36.667 --> 16:38.401
to deal with your reunion
jitters, okay?

16:38.501 --> 16:40.734
What? Oh, okay.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.651
Piper, can you move
your hors d'oeuvres

16:43.751 --> 16:44.370
to the other table?

16:44.380 --> 16:47.401
Heather wants to use that one
for the then-and-now photos.

16:47.501 --> 16:51.375
Uh, sure.
Whatever you say.

16:51.918 --> 16:54.401
No, you stand up to her.

16:54.501 --> 16:55.983
You can do it.
I can?

16:56.083 --> 16:57.192
Yeah. You can do it.

16:57.292 --> 16:59.999
Okay. Hey, bitch!

17:00.167 --> 17:01.999
Move the trays yourself!

17:04.125 --> 17:07.526
All right, um,
that was great.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.898
Although the "bitch" part

17:09.999 --> 17:11.401
might have been
a little much, but...

17:11.501 --> 17:13.858
(<i>gasps</i>):
Prue, help me!!

17:13.959 --> 17:15.567
All right.
What's wrong?

17:15.666 --> 17:18.025
Uh...

17:18.125 --> 17:18.526
nothing.

17:18.626 --> 17:23.025
I just don't feel very well.
Um, I should go home.

17:23.125 --> 17:23.983
Oh, no, you don't.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.526
I am not letting
you skip

17:25.626 --> 17:26.818
your reunion,
all right?

17:26.917 --> 17:27.898
You did great just now.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.442
I just need to rest.

17:29.542 --> 17:30.609
I'll be back.

17:30.709 --> 17:31.150
No.

17:31.250 --> 17:31.942
You get back here by 6:00.

17:32.042 --> 17:33.317
Otherwise, I'm gonna
come and get you

17:33.417 --> 17:34.899
and it won't be
pretty-- got it?

17:34.999 --> 17:35.776
Um-hmm.

17:35.876 --> 17:37.709
Uh-huh.
Okay.

17:54.918 --> 17:56.167
(<i>laughs</i>)

18:00.918 --> 18:07.900
<i>Caducas, exanimas...
 vita aetas</i>

18:08.000 --> 18:10.692
<i>anima!</i>

18:10.792 --> 18:13.234
(<i>gasps</i>)

18:13.334 --> 18:15.542
(<i>coughs</i>)

18:17.918 --> 18:19.899
What? What the hell?

18:19.999 --> 18:22.150
The spirit who
possessed you,

18:22.250 --> 18:24.899
with whom did
she replace you?

18:24.999 --> 18:28.899
What? Oh, God!

18:28.999 --> 18:32.275
Oh, God! She stabbed me!

18:32.375 --> 18:32.899
Focus!

18:32.999 --> 18:36.899
She's a woman, uh,
with brown hair.

18:36.999 --> 18:38.484
We followed her from...

18:38.584 --> 18:41.150
Prescott Street.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.401
They own the pink house
on Prescott Street.

18:43.501 --> 18:45.567
What was her plan?

18:45.667 --> 18:49.442
Uh, she, she was saying
something about wanting

18:49.542 --> 18:50.899
to kill some guy.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.484
Uh...

18:52.584 --> 18:54.025
something about revenge.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.651
Predictable.

18:56.751 --> 18:59.401
After all, that's exactly
what I would do.

18:59.501 --> 19:02.859
How-how am I still alive?

19:02.959 --> 19:06.983
Oh, no, not "still." Again.

19:07.083 --> 19:09.692
My specialty--

19:09.792 --> 19:11.000
along with this.

19:23.584 --> 19:26.234
Benjamin Coleridge-Turner
died in 1888.

19:26.334 --> 19:30.651
Although, there's no date
of death for his wife.

19:30.751 --> 19:31.484
Hmm, that's odd.

19:31.584 --> 19:34.150
There should
be some record of that.

19:34.250 --> 19:34.579
Um...

19:34.589 --> 19:36.899
they had a baby though,
didn't they, I think?

19:36.999 --> 19:38.192
Yes, a son.

19:38.292 --> 19:39.776
Cole Turner,

19:39.876 --> 19:40.899
born in 1885.

19:40.999 --> 19:44.067
Never got to know
his father unfortunately.

19:44.167 --> 19:46.484
Cole Turner.

19:46.584 --> 19:47.609
That can't be.

19:47.709 --> 19:48.609
Well, that's strange.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.150
There's no date of death
for him either.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.025
Must be another clerical error.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.818
Can't imagine he's alive
and kicking at 115.

19:55.918 --> 19:56.899
(<i>chuckles</i>)

19:56.999 --> 19:59.999
No, can't imagine that.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.359
Don't you get it?

20:11.459 --> 20:12.526
He's going to find us!

20:12.626 --> 20:14.942
Okay, I'll say it
again slowly.

20:15.042 --> 20:15.818
Try to follow this time.

20:15.918 --> 20:17.692
I'm not going to tell you
what my powers are.

20:17.792 --> 20:22.942
I can't figure out
if you're stubborn or stupid.

20:23.042 --> 20:27.083
If I can't fight him,
he's going to kill us.

20:29.959 --> 20:31.609
He's looking for me.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.776
I can feel him.

20:34.876 --> 20:35.526
He's getting close!

20:35.626 --> 20:40.083
Well, get out of my body
and I'll help you fight him.

20:40.709 --> 20:41.899
I can't survive without a body,

20:41.999 --> 20:45.250
and I'd much rather
your soul die than mine.

20:52.209 --> 20:55.567
My sisters will figure out
what you've done and...

20:55.667 --> 20:56.317
And what?

20:56.417 --> 20:57.192
What do you plan to do?

20:57.292 --> 20:58.317
Wave to them from the mirror?

20:58.417 --> 21:00.150
You're nothing
but my reflection to them.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.526
I controlled my arm at P3,
I used my voice.

21:02.626 --> 21:04.818
I'll get stronger,
and when I do...

21:04.918 --> 21:05.567
Wrong!

21:05.667 --> 21:06.609
You'll get weaker,

21:06.709 --> 21:08.275
and in a few hours you'll die.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.484
And there's really nothing
you can do about it.

21:10.584 --> 21:12.899
Well then you better watch
your back,

21:12.999 --> 21:13.454
because if I die,

21:13.464 --> 21:15.859
my sisters will make you wish
you died with me.

21:15.959 --> 21:22.999
Hmm, care about you a lot
these sisters of yours.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.734
Think they'd come running

21:29.834 --> 21:32.899
to help you fight off
an angry demon?

21:32.999 --> 21:37.150
Hello, I'd like the number
for P3 please.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.150
Oh! What do you think
you're doing?

21:39.250 --> 21:42.109
Well, you may have a death wish,
but I don't.

21:42.209 --> 21:46.792
And if you won't help me,
I know someone who will.

21:47.792 --> 21:50.067
Are you almost finished
with that?

21:50.167 --> 21:52.192
Because I need you to help
the DJ set up.

21:52.292 --> 21:54.167
(<i>clears throat</i>)

21:56.584 --> 21:56.900
Oh!

21:57.000 --> 21:59.234
That's the third time
that's happened!

21:59.334 --> 22:01.275
That's too bad.

22:01.375 --> 22:02.692
Oh, man!

22:02.792 --> 22:04.734
Okay, you guys,
just don't panic.

22:04.834 --> 22:06.818
'cause, 'cause
there's plenty of time.

22:06.918 --> 22:07.526
Heather, get to that.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.192
Look for the streamers.
Let's go!

22:09.292 --> 22:10.442
(<i>whistles softly</i>)

22:10.542 --> 22:11.401
Man, I think

22:11.501 --> 22:13.109
Missy's gonna have an embolism.

22:13.209 --> 22:13.899
Yeah, uh,

22:13.999 --> 22:16.042
can you hand me those glasses?

22:17.209 --> 22:18.900
It's weird,
though, right?

22:19.000 --> 22:19.899
I mean,
those balloons?

22:19.999 --> 22:20.942
She used, like, three
pounds of tape.

22:21.042 --> 22:23.067
Scotch tape, hardly sturdy.

22:23.167 --> 22:26.918
Yeah, but I still think
you might have a poltergeist.

22:28.792 --> 22:29.120
A what?

22:29.130 --> 22:31.942
You know, a ghost
that plays tricks.

22:32.042 --> 22:35.109
Yeah, I know
what a poltergeist is,

22:35.209 --> 22:36.899
but do you really believe
in that stuff?

22:36.999 --> 22:38.275
Yeah, absolutely.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.999
Makes life interesting.

22:42.083 --> 22:43.484
Huh.

22:43.584 --> 22:44.899
What?

22:44.999 --> 22:45.287
Nothing.

22:45.297 --> 22:49.192
It's just that, um, I think
believing in the supernatural

22:49.292 --> 22:52.375
should definitely be on my list.

22:53.709 --> 22:55.999
(<i>phone rings</i>)

22:57.918 --> 22:58.859
P3.

22:58.959 --> 23:01.109
Prue, it's me.

23:01.209 --> 23:02.359
Piper, what's wrong?

23:02.459 --> 23:03.401
I-I-I got home,

23:03.501 --> 23:06.899
and there was
a demon in the house.

23:06.999 --> 23:08.859
Are you okay?
Did you freeze him?

23:08.959 --> 23:11.401
Freeze him? That's good.

23:11.501 --> 23:14.567
No, he-he got away
and he had this

23:14.667 --> 23:17.442
wild hair and these
intense bulging eyes

23:17.542 --> 23:19.609
and he said
he was gonna come back.

23:19.709 --> 23:20.120
Uh, all right.

23:20.130 --> 23:22.109
Look in the <i>Book of Shadows
</i> for a vanquish,

23:22.209 --> 23:22.899
and I'll pick up Phoebe.

23:22.999 --> 23:24.067
We'll meet you at the house,
okay?

23:24.167 --> 23:27.609
Okay, but hurry because he
could come back any minute.

23:27.709 --> 23:29.667
All right.

23:31.792 --> 23:32.204
Where's the book?

23:32.214 --> 23:36.442
You just made a big mistake
calling my sisters home.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.025
Is that what you think?

23:38.125 --> 23:39.899
That is what I know.

23:39.999 --> 23:41.651
Well, here's what I think.

23:41.751 --> 23:43.899
When your precious sisters
come home,

23:43.999 --> 23:45.900
I'll kill you
and possess one of them.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.818
And if that one won't help me,
I'll simply repeat the process.

23:49.918 --> 23:51.900
So, what do you say, Piper?

23:52.000 --> 23:55.999
One dead demon
or three dead witches?

23:57.542 --> 24:00.234
The <i>Book of Shadows
</i> is in the attic.

24:00.334 --> 24:02.567
Good choice!

24:02.667 --> 24:05.109
(<i>ringing</i>)

24:05.209 --> 24:05.859
Hello?

24:05.959 --> 24:09.818
Hey, all right, don't panic,
but Piper found a demon

24:09.918 --> 24:11.192
in the house and I'm on my way.

24:11.292 --> 24:12.942
Was it...? Uh, wait.

24:13.042 --> 24:15.484
What-what, who was it?
What demon?

24:15.584 --> 24:18.109
Well, he had wild hair
and bulging eyes

24:18.209 --> 24:19.983
and said that he would be back.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.899
Anyway, I'm on my way
to the library

24:21.999 --> 24:22.899
to pick you up, all right?

24:22.999 --> 24:24.651
So please meet me out front?

24:24.751 --> 24:26.192
Phoebe?

24:26.292 --> 24:28.899
Uh, actually, Prue,
I'm not at the library.

24:28.999 --> 24:30.401
Well, where are you?

24:30.501 --> 24:33.734
Downtown
at the Historical Society.

24:33.834 --> 24:36.734
I needed to do some research
for a project.

24:36.834 --> 24:38.899
All right, it's fine.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.234
I'll-I'll come and pick you up.

24:41.334 --> 24:44.375
Just meet me out front. Bye.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.109
I can't wait for your sisters.

25:04.209 --> 25:06.818
Can't I just do the spell
myself?

25:06.918 --> 25:07.900
No, it's a Power-of-Three spell.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.192
You can't do it by yourself.

25:09.292 --> 25:09.899
(<i>sighs</i>)

25:09.999 --> 25:12.899
What kind of witch can't kill
a demon without her sisters?!

25:12.999 --> 25:14.899
What the hell kind of demon
has a panic attack

25:14.999 --> 25:17.083
when her boyfriend comes
to visit?

25:19.250 --> 25:21.209
Hi, this is where
you freeze him.

25:25.042 --> 25:26.734
Interesting move, Terra.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.899
The dagger
in the heart.

25:28.999 --> 25:29.412
(<i>chuckles</i>)

25:29.422 --> 25:33.275
Crude, but I can't say
I wouldn't have done the same.

25:33.375 --> 25:35.109
Of course,

25:35.209 --> 25:35.899
now I will.

25:35.999 --> 25:38.442
Kierkan, there's something
I need to tell you.

25:38.542 --> 25:42.584
You just pissed off
one of the Charmed Ones.

25:44.000 --> 25:44.899
Piper?

25:44.999 --> 25:48.834
Prue, I have the spell.

25:51.999 --> 25:54.899
"Let the flesh be flesh
and bone be bone,

25:54.999 --> 25:56.899
"the Alchemist
shall transform none.

25:56.999 --> 25:58.899
"Cruel scientist of evil born,

25:58.999 --> 26:01.983
with these words
face the fire's scorn."

26:02.083 --> 26:03.109
No!

26:03.209 --> 26:05.109
I could have
helped you!

26:05.209 --> 26:09.751
Now she'll destroy you!

26:10.918 --> 26:12.876
(<i>screaming</i>)

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
All right, what did you
say his name was again?

26:23.542 --> 26:24.692
Kierkan. But he's dead

26:24.792 --> 26:26.359
so, what are
we doing up here?

26:26.459 --> 26:27.776
Well, because
we have

26:27.876 --> 26:28.329
to at least
acknowledge

26:28.339 --> 26:32.567
the fact that there's some kind
of she-demon after us, Piper.

26:32.667 --> 26:33.234
Why?

26:33.334 --> 26:36.192
"I could have helped you,
now she'll destroy you?"

26:36.292 --> 26:37.609
It's not
exactly cryptic.

26:37.709 --> 26:40.526
Said by a demon. Demons lie.

26:40.626 --> 26:41.899
So I say
we get rid

26:41.999 --> 26:44.234
of the ugly little bottle
and get on with our lives.

26:44.334 --> 26:46.567
Piper, this bottle
is our only clue.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.401
I mean, maybe
he <i>was</i> lying,

26:48.501 --> 26:49.192
but maybe he wasn't.

26:49.292 --> 26:53.250
You know, sometimes demons
actually tell the truth.

26:53.584 --> 26:54.776
Well, I have a party

26:54.876 --> 26:55.734
to get ready for.

26:55.834 --> 26:57.584
Changing your
clothes again?

26:58.626 --> 26:59.999
Definitely.

27:03.626 --> 27:05.899
Prue. I'm dying!

27:05.999 --> 27:06.983
What?

27:07.083 --> 27:07.983
Um...

27:08.083 --> 27:11.899
I'm dying to get
out of these clothes.

27:11.999 --> 27:12.245
Um...

27:12.255 --> 27:13.317
Are you sure
you don't mind if I leave?

27:13.417 --> 27:18.000
No, go ahead. We'll let you
know if we find anything.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.275
What's up with her?

27:23.375 --> 27:25.025
It's funny.
I was kinda wondering

27:25.125 --> 27:26.999
the same thing about you.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.959
Phoebe, why did
you lie to us?

27:30.459 --> 27:32.234
Why did you say
that you were gonna be

27:32.334 --> 27:33.734
at the library all night?

27:33.834 --> 27:36.792
Oh. Uh...

27:37.999 --> 27:42.818
Okay. I wanted to check out
Cole's ancestry and I knew

27:42.918 --> 27:45.734
that you wouldn't like it.

27:45.834 --> 27:47.899
You have to know
that you can talk to me

27:47.999 --> 27:48.899
and I'm not gonna judge you.

27:48.999 --> 27:51.859
I mean, if you still have
feelings for Balthazor...

27:51.959 --> 27:54.776
No, I don't still
have feelings for Balthazor.

27:54.876 --> 27:57.542
I still have feelings for Cole.

27:57.959 --> 27:59.234
I mean he was half human.

27:59.334 --> 28:01.899
He tried to kill us for
two months, Phoebe, all right?

28:01.999 --> 28:04.234
Half human or not,
that still makes him a bad guy.

28:04.334 --> 28:07.109
But he didn't kill us, because
of his good side, Prue,

28:07.209 --> 28:08.484
which was very...

28:08.584 --> 28:09.776
...good.

28:09.876 --> 28:11.899
I mean, his dad was
a statesman who did

28:11.999 --> 28:13.899
all these amazing
things. Look.

28:13.999 --> 28:18.526
His good side and his evil
side-- they're both dead.

28:18.626 --> 28:19.150
And I don't think

28:19.250 --> 28:23.876
separating them in your mind
is going to help you let him go.

28:24.876 --> 28:29.417
I just really need to believe in
his good side right now, Prue.

28:30.999 --> 28:31.899
All right.

28:31.999 --> 28:35.401
Let's just focus on the demon
that's after us now, okay?

28:35.501 --> 28:36.999
Okay.

28:41.167 --> 28:43.067
Okay, we vanquished
your boyfriend.

28:43.167 --> 28:45.651
Now, why don't you
give me my body back

28:45.751 --> 28:47.899
and save yourself while you can?

28:47.999 --> 28:50.567
The only way I know how
to get out of the body,

28:50.667 --> 28:51.899
is a knife to the heart.

28:51.999 --> 28:53.899
You don't really
want that, do you?

28:53.999 --> 28:57.317
So tell my sisters and they
will come up with a spell

28:57.417 --> 28:59.192
to get you out of me safely,

28:59.292 --> 29:01.899
and then, in exchange,
we'll let you go free.

29:01.999 --> 29:03.401
And give up the power to freeze?

29:03.501 --> 29:06.942
A chance to be one
of the infamous Charmed Ones?

29:07.042 --> 29:09.359
No, thanks. I think I'll stay,

29:09.459 --> 29:11.567
but don't worry,
it'll be over soon.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.359
It's easier
if you don't fight it.

29:13.459 --> 29:16.567
Well, if my sisters don't figure
you out and destroy you,

29:16.667 --> 29:18.042
my boyfriend Tom will.

29:18.876 --> 29:19.999
Wow.

29:23.501 --> 29:24.025
Uh... Tom.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.567
You scared me.
I didn't hear the door.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.109
I didn't use the door.

29:28.209 --> 29:30.999
Did you just call me Tom?

29:32.459 --> 29:33.709
Did I?

29:35.125 --> 29:36.542
Forgive me.

29:44.042 --> 29:44.567
What's wrong?

29:44.667 --> 29:48.899
Nothing. It's just...
your kisses seem different.

29:48.999 --> 29:49.899
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

29:49.999 --> 29:53.999
That's just because I've
never wanted you so much.

29:55.083 --> 29:57.959
Piper... what's my name?

30:01.250 --> 30:04.999
You just couldn't leave well
enough alone, could you?

30:06.334 --> 30:07.667
(<i>groans</i>)

30:08.834 --> 30:10.234
That's okay.

30:10.334 --> 30:11.942
He's too cute to kill,

30:12.042 --> 30:12.609
and anyways,

30:12.709 --> 30:15.899
by the time
he wakes up, you'll be gone.

30:15.999 --> 30:18.651
Besides, I have
a party to attend,

30:18.751 --> 30:20.792
and lots to celebrate.

30:21.751 --> 30:24.818
Apparently alchemists
can transform anything.

30:24.918 --> 30:26.899
You know, like
water into gold,

30:26.999 --> 30:27.412
energy into matter.

30:27.422 --> 30:30.899
They even have the ability to
bring the dead back to life,

30:30.999 --> 30:33.651
but it doesn't really
say anything about...

30:33.751 --> 30:36.359
PHOEBE:
Huh. That's weird.

30:36.459 --> 30:36.900
What?

30:37.000 --> 30:37.942
Piper just left without Leo

30:38.042 --> 30:38.983
and she didn't say
good-bye to us

30:39.083 --> 30:41.900
or come up and show us
what she's wearing or anything.

30:42.000 --> 30:42.899
Here's the bottle

30:42.999 --> 30:43.899
under "Alchemist's Tools."

30:43.999 --> 30:45.109
What's it say?
"Essence-
bearer.

30:45.209 --> 30:49.025
"An alchemist would use a bottle
such as this to capture or store

30:49.125 --> 30:50.651
a life essence."

30:50.751 --> 30:51.484
A life essence?

30:51.584 --> 30:53.234
"A life essence
is comparable

30:53.334 --> 30:54.109
"to a human soul

30:54.209 --> 30:55.401
"but made in a mixing lab.

30:55.501 --> 30:56.692
"A well-made life essence

30:56.792 --> 30:57.734
"can possess any living being,

30:57.834 --> 31:01.401
"but would prove toxic and
eventually lethal to the being's

31:01.501 --> 31:04.899
pre-existing... soul."

31:04.999 --> 31:06.359
Oh, my God.

31:06.459 --> 31:07.150
What?

31:07.250 --> 31:08.859
She's been
acting really...

31:08.959 --> 31:11.025
And she left without
saying, and-and...

31:11.125 --> 31:13.942
th-th-the bottle--
she wanted to destroy it.

31:14.042 --> 31:16.192
Okay, I'm trying to jump
on your thought train here,

31:16.292 --> 31:18.899
Prue, but... you're moving
a little too fast for me.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.275
He was looking at <i>her</i>

31:20.375 --> 31:22.899
when he said that <i>she
</i> would destroy us.

31:22.999 --> 31:25.900
She's possessed.
Piper is possessed.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.025
What?

31:27.125 --> 31:27.899
All right. Uh... We

31:27.999 --> 31:30.484
have to write a spell,
a dispossessing spell.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.359
Come on, let's go.

31:31.459 --> 31:32.067
Okay.

31:32.167 --> 31:34.999
(<i>rock music playing</i>)

31:35.459 --> 31:38.899
âª Seemingly lastless,
don't mean you can ask us âª

31:38.999 --> 31:40.818
âª Pushing down the relative,
bringing out your higher self âª

31:40.918 --> 31:42.899
âª Think of the fine times,
pushing down the better few âª

31:42.999 --> 31:44.484
âª Instead of bringing out
the clues âª

31:44.584 --> 31:46.442
âª To what the world
and everything anger to âª

31:46.542 --> 31:48.401
âª Brace yourself
with the grace of ease âª

31:48.501 --> 31:52.250
âª I know this world
ain't what it seems âª

31:53.459 --> 31:54.942
Yes!
âª You're unbelievable âª

31:55.042 --> 31:56.899
âª You burden me
with your questions âª

31:56.999 --> 31:58.983
âª You'd have me tell no lies âª

31:59.083 --> 32:02.067
âª You're always asking
what it's all about âª

32:02.167 --> 32:03.899
âª But don't listen
to my replies âª

32:03.999 --> 32:07.275
âª You say to me
I don't talk enough âª

32:07.375 --> 32:08.401
âª But when I do I'm a fool âª

32:08.501 --> 32:10.859
âª These times I've spent,
I've realized... âª

32:10.959 --> 32:12.818
Hey, I'm not saying
that you're wrong.

32:12.918 --> 32:14.109
I'm just saying
that I hope

32:14.209 --> 32:15.651
you're wrong, you know.

32:15.751 --> 32:17.876
(<i>gasps</i>)
Oh!

32:18.667 --> 32:20.751
Hope. Dashed.

32:22.959 --> 32:24.401
âª The things, you say âª

32:24.501 --> 32:27.150
âª Your purple prose
just gives you away âª

32:27.250 --> 32:29.484
âª The things, you say âª

32:29.584 --> 32:32.899
âª You're unbelievable... âª

32:32.999 --> 32:35.942
Uh, all right. Come on.
We need to get her alone.

32:36.042 --> 32:36.651
Hey.

32:36.751 --> 32:38.567
you're Piper's sisters, right?

32:38.667 --> 32:39.859
Yeah. Good memory.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.899
Okay, um... listen.

32:41.999 --> 32:44.899
I think I know what
Piper's going through.

32:44.999 --> 32:45.899
Uh...

32:45.999 --> 32:47.442
I have been sober

32:47.542 --> 32:50.359
for about five years
now, myself,

32:50.459 --> 32:54.899
and... if Piper ever wants
to go to a meeting,

32:54.999 --> 32:58.899
would you... tell her
to call me?

32:58.999 --> 33:01.025
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.

33:01.125 --> 33:02.150
Great.

33:02.250 --> 33:03.999
Great.

33:04.751 --> 33:06.899
It's a good thing
Leo is not here.

33:06.999 --> 33:07.859
Dennis!

33:07.959 --> 33:09.899
What is the matter with you?

33:09.999 --> 33:11.942
Oh, wow, honey...

33:12.042 --> 33:14.209
I'm sorry.

33:16.334 --> 33:17.150
Oh!

33:17.250 --> 33:19.317
Oh, oh.

33:19.417 --> 33:19.983
I am so sorry!

33:20.083 --> 33:23.626
Hi. Your wife
went that way. Bye.

33:23.999 --> 33:25.818
We need to show
you something.

33:25.918 --> 33:28.999
âª You're unbelievable... âª

33:30.999 --> 33:33.442
BOTH:
"Host soul reject
the poison essence.

33:33.542 --> 33:37.334
Let love's light
end this cruel possession."

33:41.250 --> 33:42.234
Clever, girls.

33:42.334 --> 33:43.899
Piper said you
would figure it out,

33:43.999 --> 33:46.526
although Piper won't be saying
anything in about half an hour.

33:46.626 --> 33:49.818
She's too strong.
We need the Power of Three.

33:49.918 --> 33:52.192
You have ten seconds
to leave on your own.

33:52.292 --> 33:53.651
Or what?

33:53.751 --> 33:56.275
What are you gonna do, hit me
with another rhyming couplet?

33:56.375 --> 33:58.359
I'm made
from Kierkan's blood,

33:58.459 --> 34:00.442
which means I have his powers.

34:00.542 --> 34:01.317
Add that to Piper's powers

34:01.417 --> 34:03.983
and I'm stronger
than your average essence.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.401
Okay, we need help.

34:06.501 --> 34:07.234
Leo!

34:07.334 --> 34:09.442
Leo!
Oh, is that the boyfriend?

34:09.542 --> 34:10.275
I had to give him

34:10.375 --> 34:10.900
a little jolt.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.900
He'll be unconscious
for a while.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.192
You might be able
to knock out

34:14.292 --> 34:15.899
a whitelighter,
but don't even think

34:15.998 --> 34:17.234
you can take on
the Charmed Ones.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.775
Uh... the bottle
won't work on me.

34:19.876 --> 34:21.150
Unless I'm not
in a body,

34:21.250 --> 34:24.109
and to get me out, you'd
have to kill your own sister.

34:24.208 --> 34:25.025
Call me a gambler,

34:25.125 --> 34:29.000
but I seriously doubt
you're willing to do that.

34:29.998 --> 34:32.333
Get the hell out
of my sister.

34:35.167 --> 34:37.417
All right.

34:40.918 --> 34:42.567
If you insist.

34:42.667 --> 34:43.751
No, don't!

34:46.998 --> 34:49.292
That's what I thought.

35:04.999 --> 35:07.359
Okay, are you gonna
fill me in on the plan?

35:07.459 --> 35:08.275
I'll explain
on the way.

35:08.375 --> 35:10.192
PHOEBE:
On the way where?
Home.

35:10.292 --> 35:11.983
All right, there she is.
We need Leo.

35:12.083 --> 35:14.109
Hi. You're coming
with us, okay?

35:14.209 --> 35:15.899
Like hell I am!

35:15.999 --> 35:17.192
Piper, listen to me...

35:17.292 --> 35:17.900
Whoo!

35:18.000 --> 35:19.109
You know what...?

35:19.209 --> 35:20.234
MEN:
Oh!

35:20.334 --> 35:21.359
Cat fight! Dude!

35:21.459 --> 35:22.401
Cat fight!
Look at that!

35:22.501 --> 35:23.109
PEOPLE:
Oh!

35:23.209 --> 35:24.192
MAN:
Oh!

35:24.292 --> 35:25.417
(<i>man yells</i>)

35:26.292 --> 35:28.150

35:28.250 --> 35:29.899
MAN:
Karate.

35:29.999 --> 35:30.899
Oh, nice.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.567
I knew they weren't
that close.

35:33.667 --> 35:34.859
PRUE:
Hey.

35:34.959 --> 35:35.899
Hi. She's, uh, probably

35:35.999 --> 35:36.899
possessed.

35:36.999 --> 35:38.609
Little help
to the car?

35:38.709 --> 35:39.818
You okay?

35:39.918 --> 35:42.192
Oh. All right.

35:42.292 --> 35:43.484
Okay.
All right.

35:43.584 --> 35:44.899
Ah, show's over, people.

35:44.999 --> 35:47.692
Just talk amongst
yourselves.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.459
Cool...

35:55.125 --> 35:57.818
All right, if we can get back
the Power of Three,

35:57.918 --> 35:58.899
we stand a chance.

35:58.999 --> 35:59.818
I still don't

35:59.918 --> 36:01.484
understand
how this is gonna work.

36:01.584 --> 36:02.818
She has the alchemist's powers,

36:02.918 --> 36:03.942
which means she has the ability

36:04.042 --> 36:05.317
to bring the dead back to life.

36:05.417 --> 36:07.709
Yeah, but she's not dead, Prue.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.899
Is there something
you're not telling me?

36:09.999 --> 36:11.776
Phoebe, I just need you
to trust me, okay?

36:11.876 --> 36:16.834
So, go find Leo, wake him up,
and get him down here fast.

36:33.999 --> 36:34.734
Piper,

36:34.834 --> 36:37.859
I know that you're in there
somewhere, all right?

36:37.959 --> 36:38.734
So, just try and listen.

36:38.834 --> 36:43.501
Just remember
that no matter what happens...

36:43.999 --> 36:46.542
I'm gonna bring you back.

36:47.125 --> 36:48.526
(<i>sniffles</i>)

36:48.626 --> 36:51.000
I am so sorry, honey.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.999
I know that you tried to tell me
in the attic, and I...

36:59.000 --> 37:01.192
I'm gonna fix it, okay?

37:01.292 --> 37:03.999
I promise I'll bring you back.

37:04.667 --> 37:06.667
(<i>sniffles</i>)

37:09.792 --> 37:13.667
Please forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

(<i>grunts</i>)

37:17.292 --> 37:18.317
No!

37:23.292 --> 37:25.042

37:37.999 --> 37:40.442
(<i>sighs</i>)

37:40.542 --> 37:43.375
That I didn't expect.

37:44.042 --> 37:45.109
Little sibling rivalry

37:45.209 --> 37:47.275
I failed to take into account?

37:47.375 --> 37:48.667
Shut up!

37:50.125 --> 37:51.234
Bring Piper back to life,

37:51.334 --> 37:53.651
and I'll let you keep
Leo's body.

37:53.751 --> 37:54.109
Refuse,

37:54.209 --> 37:55.859
and I'll put that knife
through his heart

37:55.959 --> 37:58.292
and suck you back
in the bottle forever.

37:58.709 --> 37:59.651
But then your sister

37:59.751 --> 38:01.359
and her boyfriend would be dead.

38:01.459 --> 38:03.751
Not the world's smartest plan.

38:04.167 --> 38:05.192
She's already dead.

38:05.292 --> 38:07.292
I have nothing left to lose.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.067
Give me the bottle,

38:09.167 --> 38:10.275
and I'll bring her back.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.999
Bring our sister back,
and we'll give you the bottle.

to...

Okay.

40:10.751 --> 40:11.621
I guess I'm gonna
call Morris,

and tell him about
the body in the alley.

So, you said

40:18.209 --> 40:20.275
you were gonna explain
about the bar brawl.

40:20.375 --> 40:20.899
Uh-huh.

40:20.999 --> 40:22.859
And you waited all this time

on your list.

Mm-hmm.

You okay?

40:58.792 --> 40:59.983
I don't know.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.025
Phoebe, you've got

41:02.125 --> 41:04.526
to give it some time. Cole...

41:04.626 --> 41:05.899
Seduced me,

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
and I let him.

41:08.876 --> 41:09.776
On the other hand,

41:09.876 --> 41:11.692
Piper was completely
taken over by evil,

41:11.792 --> 41:13.651
and she fought it
every step of the way.

41:13.751 --> 41:17.818
Well, seduction is subtler
than possession.

41:17.918 --> 41:20.651
It's harder to fight.

41:20.751 --> 41:24.025
You didn't know Cole was evil.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.899
Nobody did.

41:26.999 --> 41:29.999
When you found out,
you vanquished him.

41:32.167 --> 41:35.876
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

41:37.999 --> 41:40.417
He's still alive.
