Guess what, Charlie?

01:32.471 --> 01:34.174
We're one day away from going on
your first trip on an airplane

01:34.244 --> 01:35.877
and celebrating our first Christmas

01:35.947 --> 01:37.879
at Grandma and Grandpa's
new condo in Palm Springs!

01:37.949 --> 01:38.981
You're going to have so much fun.

01:38.981 --> 01:41.695
No, no, no, Mom, you have
to toddler-proof the place.

01:41.765 --> 01:43.398
Just so long as you don't touch anything.

01:43.468 --> 01:46.043
No, anything breakable has to be at
least three feet off the ground.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.078
Uh-oh.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.193
Make that four.
I gotta go.

01:52.253 --> 01:53.755
Charlie, get back in here!

01:53.825 --> 01:56.768
No, no, no, stay away,
there's shards everywhere!

01:56.828 --> 01:58.741
Are you eating a cookie in the living room?

01:58.801 --> 02:00.043
You get back here!

02:00.104 --> 02:01.816
And stay away!

02:01.876 --> 02:03.318
Mom's a little frazzled.

02:05.923 --> 02:08.157
Mom, why are you so stressed out?

02:08.227 --> 02:10.431
Because this is an extremely
important Christmas.

02:10.501 --> 02:11.803
Why?

02:11.873 --> 02:13.476
Because!

02:13.546 --> 02:15.179
Of...
The...

02:17.321 --> 02:18.953
Because we're going to Palm Springs!

02:19.954 --> 02:21.426
Why is that more stressful?

02:21.496 --> 02:23.400
You don't have to cook,
you don't have to clean.

02:23.470 --> 02:25.233
You can just sit out by the pool.

02:25.303 --> 02:28.949
At what price, Teddy?
At what price?

02:29.019 --> 02:32.395
What if we lose the things that make
Christmas in Denver so special?

02:32.455 --> 02:35.529
Like the blizzards?
The endless chapped lips?

02:35.599 --> 02:40.347
Listening to Mrs.
Dabney's talking Santa go "Ho, ho, ho,"

02:40.407 --> 02:43.320
on an endless, rip-your-
own-eardrums-out loop?

02:43.381 --> 02:46.424
No, I'm talking about
our family traditions!

02:46.494 --> 02:48.027
Mom, I'm pretty sure Dad's going to overeat

02:48.097 --> 02:49.730
and get heartburn no matter where we are.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.535
No.
The good traditions!

02:52.605 --> 02:57.152
Like making little tree-shaped
pancakes on Christmas morning!

02:57.222 --> 02:58.986
We can do that at Grandma's.

02:59.056 --> 03:02.202
I'm pretty sure flour and eggs
are available nationwide.

03:02.262 --> 03:03.664
Okay. What about...

03:06.147 --> 03:07.708
What about the star?

03:07.777 --> 03:08.910
What?

03:08.980 --> 03:11.123
The star on the tree tradition.

03:13.456 --> 03:16.562
Where your father takes the
littlest Duncan in his arms

03:16.632 --> 03:18.435
and lifts her high to the heavens,

03:18.505 --> 03:21.881
to crown the tree with its finest jewel.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.652
That is so not a big deal.

03:23.723 --> 03:25.054
Are you kidding me?

03:25.125 --> 03:27.158
Do you know how important
that is to your sister?

03:28.860 --> 03:32.604
Look, Charlie!
It's the star!

03:32.674 --> 03:34.808
And what do we do with it on Christmas Eve?

03:36.551 --> 03:37.853
No, no, no, we don't eat the star.

03:40.227 --> 03:41.659
No, no, no, we do not throw the star.

03:41.729 --> 03:42.831
We are not Christmas ninjas.

03:43.873 --> 03:45.235
See? Not a big deal.

03:46.377 --> 03:48.650
<i>Ho, ho, ho.</i>

03:48.711 --> 03:51.455
It is so cold out there,

03:51.525 --> 03:53.788
I'm pretty sure I saw a snowman shivering!

03:53.858 --> 03:55.430
PJ, will you tell your sister

03:55.500 --> 03:58.464
how important the star on the
Christmas tree tradition is.

03:58.534 --> 03:59.777
The what?
On the what?

03:59.837 --> 04:01.008
Whatever.

04:01.949 --> 04:04.313
Guys, check this out.

04:04.383 --> 04:06.288
Snowmen!

04:06.358 --> 04:07.590
You bought a Christmas swimsuit?

04:07.660 --> 04:10.305
Uh, no, I bought

04:12.277 --> 04:14.441
two Christmas swimsuits.

04:14.511 --> 04:16.444
Well, that was money well spent.

04:16.514 --> 04:17.886
I know!

04:17.956 --> 04:20.358
I cannot wait to get to sunny Palm Springs,

04:20.428 --> 04:23.102
where the only thing that's
frozen are the slushies.

04:23.162 --> 04:24.335
<i>Ho, ho, ho.</i>

04:24.405 --> 04:26.808
Wow.
That never gets old. Hey!

04:29.383 --> 04:31.155
Look what I got for 30 bucks.

04:31.215 --> 04:33.360
A stroller?
Yeah, a stroller.

04:33.430 --> 04:36.534
And a car seat!
And an airplane seat!

04:36.604 --> 04:38.769
And it's completely convertible!

04:38.839 --> 04:39.979
I press this button right here,

04:40.039 --> 04:41.842
the whole thing retracts.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.758
In theory.

04:51.866 --> 04:53.239
Come on!

04:58.357 --> 05:00.329
It was 30 bucks!

05:00.389 --> 05:02.293
Will you please tell your kids

05:02.363 --> 05:04.766
how important the star
on the tree tradition is?

05:04.836 --> 05:06.467
Uh, kids, very important.

05:06.538 --> 05:08.981
What is?
The thing that your mom said.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.683
Whatever.

05:18.107 --> 05:20.541
Ow! Ow!

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:31.737 --> 05:32.969
Gabe.

05:33.679 --> 05:34.942
Gabe.

05:36.485 --> 05:38.787
Gabe!

05:38.857 --> 05:43.395
What? I'm only 15 levels away from
capturing the Stone of Mitrios.

05:43.466 --> 05:44.999
<i>Galaxy of Death Two
is totally addictive!</i>

05:47.141 --> 05:49.315
How is it that you're already
playing your Christmas present?

05:50.146 --> 05:51.117
Did I say two?

05:52.790 --> 05:55.634
<i>I meant one.
Galaxy of Death One.</i>

05:55.694 --> 05:58.136
<i>Obviously!
'Cause to play Two,</i>

05:58.196 --> 06:00.271
I would've had to figure out
where you hid the presents,

06:00.341 --> 06:02.214
secretly unwrap mine,
take out the game disk,

06:02.283 --> 06:03.846
rewrap the empty box, and, um...

06:05.589 --> 06:07.222
Have I told you lately how much I love you?

06:09.497 --> 06:11.900
How important is the star on
the tree tradition to you?

06:11.970 --> 06:13.172
How important do you want it to be?

06:13.243 --> 06:14.415
Wouldn't be Christmas without it.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.647
It really wouldn't.

06:15.717 --> 06:17.488
Tell your siblings that?

06:17.548 --> 06:19.890
I'll tell everybody that!
I'll call random strangers and tell them!

06:19.960 --> 06:22.124
Excellent.

06:22.194 --> 06:24.400
Oh. Can I bring my game
system to Grandma's?

06:24.470 --> 06:25.971
No, you may not.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.373
Okay. No big deal.

06:29.247 --> 06:31.620
And I will be searching your
luggage before we leave.

06:31.690 --> 06:32.852
Dang it!

06:34.465 --> 06:37.740
"If handles do not retract,
apply gentle pressure."

06:39.012 --> 06:40.874
You know, it might be a feature.

06:40.944 --> 06:44.918
Like it's a combination
car-seat-stroller-exercise- machine.

06:47.964 --> 06:49.937
Okay, just so you know, Teddy,

06:49.997 --> 06:54.043
that star on the tree tradition means
everything to your brother Gabe!

06:54.114 --> 06:55.716
Where is it?

06:58.821 --> 07:00.223
<i>Ho, ho, ho.</i>

07:00.293 --> 07:02.969
Can it, Santa!
Hey. Hi, Mr. D.

07:03.039 --> 07:04.770
Hey!

07:04.840 --> 07:06.471
Wow. What's going
on in here?

07:06.541 --> 07:07.744
We're going to Palm Springs for Christmas.

07:07.814 --> 07:09.246
Oh, right!

07:09.316 --> 07:13.353
Two plane rides to exotic
destinations in four months.

07:13.423 --> 07:16.126
You did tell your parents
about Spring Break, right?

07:16.197 --> 07:18.140
We have to book those tickets by next week.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.943
No, I know! I know!
I'm just waiting for a good time to ask.

07:20.014 --> 07:21.276
Is now a good time?

07:21.978 --> 07:23.949
Really?

07:24.019 --> 07:26.123
I can't find the star, okay?
Umm.

07:26.193 --> 07:29.198
No star!
Christmas is ruined!

07:31.701 --> 07:33.543
All right.
Not a good time.

07:33.613 --> 07:36.078
But just remember, if you
don't book that ticket soon,

07:36.148 --> 07:38.191
you're gonna be spending Spring
Break right on that couch.

07:38.251 --> 07:40.154
<i>Ho, ho, ho.
And I'm going out the back.</i>

07:42.498 --> 07:44.602
Oh! Victory!

07:47.046 --> 07:49.249
So... Dad.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.754
Daddy-o.

07:51.824 --> 07:54.227
Big D.
Don't add to the stress, kiddo.

07:54.297 --> 07:56.569
Why are you guys so on edge?

07:56.629 --> 07:59.704
And why's Mom freaking out about
that stupid star on the tree?

07:59.774 --> 08:02.348
Honey, because sometimes the
thing that you focus on

08:02.417 --> 08:04.150
isn't the thing that's
causing all the stress.

08:04.221 --> 08:06.194
So what is?

08:06.254 --> 08:08.698
The... Well, it's...

08:09.800 --> 08:11.401
The...

08:11.472 --> 08:14.547
The first time we're spending Christmas

08:14.617 --> 08:16.550
at your grandparents'
new place in Palm Springs.

08:16.620 --> 08:17.992
So?

08:18.052 --> 08:19.724
So...

08:19.794 --> 08:22.426
So, when I married your mom,

08:22.497 --> 08:24.931
your grandmother thought...

08:25.001 --> 08:26.804
Your grandmother thought I was an idiot

08:26.874 --> 08:28.417
that had ruined her daughter's life.

08:28.477 --> 08:31.251
This is my chance
to change that impression.

08:31.321 --> 08:34.727
Dad, you've been spending Christmas
with Grandma for 20 years.

08:34.797 --> 08:36.129
And I really think this is my year.

08:37.501 --> 08:38.504
What?

08:38.573 --> 08:41.006
Oh! Mom, Mom, Mom.
Okay, so...

08:41.077 --> 08:43.120
Ivy and I have this awesome opportunity!

08:43.179 --> 08:45.953
Her aunt lives in Florida.
On the beach!

08:46.024 --> 08:48.399
And she said that Ivy and I could
stay with her over Spring Break.

08:48.469 --> 08:50.430
Isn't that great?
Yeah, sure.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.544
If you were 23 years old.

08:52.604 --> 08:55.309
Teddy, you are too young to go
across the country without an adult.

08:55.379 --> 08:57.022
Mom, that is so unfair!

08:57.083 --> 09:00.597
End of story! We are not spending
another minute discussing this.

09:00.657 --> 09:02.601
But, Mom, you let
me baby-sit Charlie.

09:02.671 --> 09:04.133
Why are we still discussing this?

09:04.203 --> 09:05.635
Because it's not right.

09:05.706 --> 09:07.247
You know what's not right?

09:07.307 --> 09:09.779
A 14-hour argument when there's
nothing to argue about.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.483
For the last time, no!

09:11.553 --> 09:13.656
She thinks that's going
to be the last time.

09:15.158 --> 09:16.671
So I'm old enough to take care
of Charlie but not myself?

09:16.732 --> 09:18.274
Mom, that doesn't make any sense!

09:18.334 --> 09:20.177
Sweetheart, I'm your mother,
I never make sense.

09:20.247 --> 09:21.910
Okay, let me rephrase this.

09:21.980 --> 09:23.653
Please, please, please, please, please...

09:23.723 --> 09:27.159
All right.
Honey, I got this.

09:27.228 --> 09:29.200
Okay, kiddo, I'll tell you what.

09:29.271 --> 09:32.204
If you can be responsible enough
to buy your own plane ticket,

09:32.274 --> 09:34.808
then you are responsible enough
to go to Florida on your own.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.111
Bob!
Dad, that's impossible!

09:36.181 --> 09:37.752
I have to buy the ticket by next week!

09:37.822 --> 09:39.996
Ooh. Not so easy
being an adult, is it?

09:41.628 --> 09:43.802
See that?
Problem solved.

09:47.778 --> 09:48.749
Oh, no!

09:50.454 --> 09:51.655
Metal detectors!

09:52.627 --> 09:54.628
Relax.
I think you'll make it.

09:54.699 --> 09:56.531
As long as you're not smuggling anything!

10:04.885 --> 10:06.689
Sir, could you please
retract that stroller?

10:06.759 --> 10:08.601
Probably not without pulling a muscle.

10:13.740 --> 10:17.485
You all right, dude?
You look a little sweaty.

10:17.555 --> 10:20.488
I'm fine. Yeah.
I'm fine. I'm cool.

10:22.662 --> 10:23.734
Come on, son.

10:26.677 --> 10:28.782
Code red! Code red!
Hands in the air!

10:28.852 --> 10:31.126
Code red! Code red!
This is a code red!

10:31.187 --> 10:32.629
Hang on, please, don't move.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.967
He is not the wisest man
in the manger, is he?

10:38.037 --> 10:41.412
Who would try to smuggle a game
system without a controller?

10:44.385 --> 10:46.187
Whoa!

10:46.257 --> 10:48.492
How did that get there?

10:48.562 --> 10:50.534
You're a really heavy sleeper.

10:54.581 --> 10:56.454
Okay, you're clear to go.

10:56.514 --> 10:59.731
And thank you for the
extremely thorough search.

10:59.791 --> 11:02.937
You guys, our flight leaves
in two minutes! Go! Run!

11:06.509 --> 11:07.441
Okay.

11:09.414 --> 11:10.716
Bob! Hurry!

11:10.786 --> 11:11.888
Right behind you!

11:14.831 --> 11:17.236
Okay, honey, you know what?

11:18.268 --> 11:20.912
We're going for a sleigh ride!

11:20.982 --> 11:23.256
<i>♪ I said run, run, Rudolph</i>

11:23.315 --> 11:25.388
<i>♪ Santa's gotta
make it to town</i>

11:27.893 --> 11:29.465
<i>♪ Santa, make him hurry</i>

11:29.535 --> 11:32.107
<i>♪ Tell him he can
take the freeway down</i>

11:34.580 --> 11:36.244
<i>♪ Run, run, Rudolph</i>

11:36.314 --> 11:38.617
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm racin'
like a merry go round</i>

11:40.691 --> 11:42.765
<i>♪ Said Santa to a boy child</i>

11:42.835 --> 11:45.209
<i>♪ What have you

11:47.242 --> 11:49.015
<i>♪ All I want for Christmas</i>

12:13.643 --> 12:14.915
<i>♪ Run, run, Rudolph</i>

12:16.448 --> 12:19.721
You didn't need to do that, sir.
We saw you coming.

12:19.792 --> 12:22.334
<i>♪ Santa Claus
is coming to town ♪</i>

12:27.382 --> 12:28.475
Can I buy a headset?

12:28.545 --> 12:29.487
Sure.

12:31.659 --> 12:32.962
Look at you.

12:33.022 --> 12:35.937
All that joy, trapped in
a skinny, little box.

12:35.997 --> 12:38.572
Oh, so sad.

12:38.602 --> 12:41.675
Dude. You didn't even
bring the game with you.

12:44.618 --> 12:45.990
Yeah I did.

12:48.766 --> 12:51.338
There. Finally.

12:52.511 --> 12:54.774
It's fine.
We'll leave it up.

12:54.845 --> 12:56.848
Sir, can you put that handle down?

12:56.918 --> 12:58.391
Can you?

12:58.461 --> 12:59.792
I'll get it.

13:01.424 --> 13:02.867
If I can have your attention.

13:02.937 --> 13:04.700
We are overbooked by one seat.

13:04.770 --> 13:07.042
So we're looking for a volunteer
to take a later flight

13:07.112 --> 13:09.675
in exchange for a free round
trip ticket to any destination.

13:10.246 --> 13:11.318
Me!

13:13.862 --> 13:15.526
What are you doing?

13:15.596 --> 13:17.440
I'm being responsible!
For getting a plane ticket to Spring Break.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.771
I'll be on the next flight out!

13:18.842 --> 13:19.943
Are you going to let her do that?

13:20.013 --> 13:21.246
Little busy here, honey.

13:21.316 --> 13:22.578
I'll meet you guys in Palm Springs!

13:22.647 --> 13:25.252
Probably just be a couple hours behind you.

13:25.322 --> 13:27.395
I have to go with her, right?
Uh-huh.

13:30.839 --> 13:32.501
Yes!

13:32.571 --> 13:34.574
There we go!
That's the way to do it!

13:34.644 --> 13:36.889
There you go.
Yeah, baby!

13:36.949 --> 13:40.023
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

13:41.766 --> 13:43.269
Where's your mom?

13:43.330 --> 13:46.044
You know, ma'am, we only
asked for the one volunteer.

13:46.104 --> 13:49.118
You think I'm going to let my daughter
get off the plane by herself?

13:49.178 --> 13:51.382
You want to tell me how to be a parent?
You want to go there?

13:51.451 --> 13:54.196
No, ma'am.
No, I don't.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.728
Here's your free ticket.

13:56.799 --> 13:59.101
And let's see about getting both of you

13:59.172 --> 14:00.845
on the next available flight.

14:00.915 --> 14:02.877
Which is...

14:04.190 --> 14:05.953
...in three days.
What?

14:06.023 --> 14:08.267
Okay, Mom, I am going to show
you how responsible I am.

14:08.328 --> 14:10.031
Okay?
Let me handle this.

14:11.674 --> 14:14.108
You don't really mean three days, do you?

14:14.178 --> 14:15.550
Yes, I do.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.682
That's the next flight
that isn't fully booked.

14:17.752 --> 14:18.852
It is the holidays.

14:20.195 --> 14:22.067
But it won't be in three days.

14:22.127 --> 14:25.944
That's December 26th.
Christmas will be over.

14:26.004 --> 14:28.048
I'm sorry.
It's the best we can do.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.250
Oh.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.783
I think we can do better.

14:31.854 --> 14:35.499
Ma'am, are you telling me how to do my job?

14:35.569 --> 14:37.272
Do you want to go there?

14:37.342 --> 14:40.447
Oh, yeah.
I want to go there.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.824
Guys, guys, put me down.
Put me down!

14:45.893 --> 14:48.899
Really very unnecessary!

14:48.969 --> 14:50.371
Mom, you shouldn't have hit her.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.977
I didn't hit her!
I was gesturing for emphasis.

14:54.047 --> 14:55.679
Mom, you gestured her right in the nose!

14:56.681 --> 14:58.455
What's gotten into you?

14:58.525 --> 15:02.401
Teddy, we're 1000 miles from Palm
Springs and we can't get a flight!

15:02.471 --> 15:03.733
We're going to miss Christmas!

15:03.803 --> 15:05.535
Mom, Mom, Mom, don't freak out!

15:05.605 --> 15:07.447
I will find a way to
get us to Palm Springs.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.808
How?

15:08.879 --> 15:10.180
Well...

15:11.693 --> 15:13.056
Wait for it.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.573
Bus!

15:17.633 --> 15:19.636
I could've thought of that.

15:24.283 --> 15:27.199
Well, Charlie, here we are,
on our luxury motor coach.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.872
For our brief, 18-hour
ride to Palm Springs.

15:30.933 --> 15:32.806
Too bad the video can't
quite capture the smell.

15:34.748 --> 15:37.984
Look, someone brought livestock!
Is that even legal?

15:40.398 --> 15:42.532
Look, Charlie, we found you a boyfriend.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.379
That might have been my last video diary.

15:56.062 --> 15:58.936
Yes! This is what
I've always wanted, man.

15:59.006 --> 16:00.339
An 80 degree Christmas.

16:00.409 --> 16:01.751
Man, this is beautiful.

16:01.811 --> 16:04.514
Hey, honey. Honey?
Where are you?

16:04.585 --> 16:07.059
On a bus.
But don't worry,

16:07.129 --> 16:10.665
we'll be there in just 18 short hours!

16:10.734 --> 16:13.478
You're gonna leave me alone
with your mother for 18 hours?

16:13.538 --> 16:16.283
Well, honey, my dad's there.

16:16.353 --> 16:17.785
<i>Form an alliance with him.</i>

16:17.855 --> 16:20.628
And just keep her focused on the kids.
She loves them.

16:20.698 --> 16:23.001
Oh, my gosh.
I think my seat has bedbugs!

16:23.061 --> 16:25.605
He's taking the chickens out of the cage!
I gotta go! Bye!

16:25.676 --> 16:27.037
He's what... Honey?

16:27.979 --> 16:29.713
Honey?

16:29.783 --> 16:31.215
What's the matter, Dad?

16:31.285 --> 16:32.988
Your mom's delayed

16:33.058 --> 16:35.763
and the chickens are out of the
cages, whatever that means.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.437
All right, guys.
One rule.

16:38.507 --> 16:41.652
Do not leave me alone
in a room with Grandma.

16:41.712 --> 16:43.554
I heard that.
Oh, hey!

16:44.455 --> 16:45.757
Grandma!

16:47.901 --> 16:51.605
Oh! My little angels!

16:52.407 --> 16:53.939
Hi!

16:54.009 --> 16:55.954
Gramps!
How you doing?

16:58.729 --> 17:00.791
Okay.

17:00.861 --> 17:04.708
Sweet Charlie!
Look how you've grown!

17:04.768 --> 17:06.711
Who wants a mint?

17:06.779 --> 17:08.712
Hey, Hank!
How are you?

17:08.781 --> 17:11.556
Well, I only got half a kidney
left, but I'm still here.

17:12.829 --> 17:14.531
Mint?
Okay.

17:15.633 --> 17:17.435
Where's my daughter and Teddy?

17:17.506 --> 17:20.611
Um, they're on a bus.

17:20.681 --> 17:24.156
You couldn't kill enough bugs to
pay for two extra plane tickets?

17:24.217 --> 17:26.421
Zing!
Good one, Grandma!

17:26.491 --> 17:27.592
In your face!

17:27.663 --> 17:28.864
Petunia, it's just
a little mix-up.

17:28.934 --> 17:30.567
They're gonna be here tomorrow.

17:30.637 --> 17:34.781
All aboard! Next stop, Fountain
of Youth Condominiums.

17:34.842 --> 17:38.287
Wow. Grandpa, how'd you
get an antique like this?

17:39.358 --> 17:40.891
I bought it new.

17:48.182 --> 17:49.986
This could be fun!

17:50.056 --> 17:51.189
Right?

17:51.259 --> 17:55.263
Look, I bought magazines
at the bus station.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.666
Yeah, I'm not really
up for reading right now.

17:57.736 --> 17:59.308
Oh, don't worry, these
are fashion magazines.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.771
They don't require any reading at all!

18:01.282 --> 18:02.384
Mmm.

18:04.658 --> 18:07.893
You okay?
You look a little green.

18:07.963 --> 18:10.439
Yeah, I think I'm getting a little carsick.

18:10.509 --> 18:12.041
Can I borrow your bag?

18:12.111 --> 18:13.874
Let me just take the magazines...

18:14.545 --> 18:16.417
...out.

18:16.487 --> 18:18.520
Oh, that is...
Not over yet!

18:21.734 --> 18:23.567
Wow, Mom.

18:23.637 --> 18:25.841
That's a really harsh
review of the spring line.

18:34.095 --> 18:36.137
Goodbye, freezing snowmen,

18:36.197 --> 18:40.073
hello smoking-hot
granddaughters.

18:40.143 --> 18:41.846
Their mothers aren't bad either!

18:41.916 --> 18:43.988
Oh, hey!

18:44.059 --> 18:45.590
By the way, speaking of hot,

18:45.660 --> 18:48.094
make sure you wear your sunblock.
The sun here is brutal.

18:48.164 --> 18:49.596
Do they make holiday sunblock?

18:49.666 --> 18:51.369
One that smells like
eggnog instead of coconut?

18:52.872 --> 18:54.745
Do you know what he's talking about?

18:54.815 --> 18:56.247
Not at all.

18:56.317 --> 18:58.693
His brain works differently than ours do.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.171
Come on in.

19:04.242 --> 19:05.743
Kiddie suite to the left.

19:05.813 --> 19:07.374
To the left, kiddie suite to the left.

19:07.444 --> 19:09.047
Don't touch the pillow mints.

19:09.117 --> 19:10.719
They're for later.

19:12.363 --> 19:13.925
All right.

19:13.995 --> 19:16.969
You know, Charlie's at a
pretty rambunctious age.

19:17.039 --> 19:19.042
I mean, you, uh...

19:19.113 --> 19:21.216
You did child-proof
the place, right?

19:21.276 --> 19:23.049
Of course!
Everything's been put away

19:23.119 --> 19:24.820
except the Christmas decorations.

19:24.891 --> 19:27.466
Just keep her away from the
low-hanging tree ornaments.

19:28.627 --> 19:31.571
And my antique nativity scene.

19:31.641 --> 19:34.945
And especially Santa's reindeer.

19:35.015 --> 19:39.051
It's priceless. They haven't
made one like that in 50 years.

19:39.121 --> 19:40.394
Santa!

19:41.466 --> 19:43.739
Oh! No, no! No!
No, no, no.

19:43.799 --> 19:48.117
No!
No, no, no, no.

19:48.177 --> 19:50.621
Any chance we could put this stuff away?

19:50.691 --> 19:53.825
Don't be ridiculous!
Just tell her not to touch them.

19:53.895 --> 19:56.198
You did have kids once, right?

19:56.268 --> 19:58.671
Yes.
Ours were well-behaved

19:58.741 --> 20:00.876
because we knew how to parent them.

20:02.116 --> 20:03.047
Okay.

20:07.227 --> 20:08.799
Hey, Mom, you okay?

20:08.869 --> 20:11.574
Just peachy, sweetheart...

20:11.644 --> 20:15.219
Okay, 'cause somebody's been
waiting for over an hour.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.152
You probably wouldn't want
to go in there anyway.

20:19.194 --> 20:20.896
Hold the phone!

20:27.245 --> 20:29.019
Keep her away from my chickens.

20:34.198 --> 20:36.631
That mountain air is nice.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.244
Shouldn't we be finding a doctor?

20:38.304 --> 20:40.308
I'm fine!
I was just a little carsick.

20:40.378 --> 20:43.721
That's like calling World War
II just a little disagreement.

20:43.781 --> 20:46.725
Oh, look at you, staying
awake during history class.

20:46.795 --> 20:48.499
Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry,

20:48.569 --> 20:49.901
but I can't let you back on the bus.

20:49.971 --> 20:52.304
The other passengers
refuse to travel with you.

20:52.374 --> 20:53.576
What?

20:55.819 --> 20:57.553
Okay. Listen, people,

20:57.623 --> 20:59.596
I didn't want to get on this
stinking bus in the first place!

21:01.227 --> 21:02.831
Ah, you think that's funny?

21:04.774 --> 21:06.105
Mom, you might want to be careful.

21:06.175 --> 21:08.748
The chickens are getting
into their fighting position.

21:08.818 --> 21:12.083
So what I think my mom is trying to express

21:12.153 --> 21:14.096
is it's a little bit unfair
that you're letting

21:14.156 --> 21:17.032
the chicken man on the bus, but not us.

21:17.102 --> 21:19.576
Yeah, but the chickens aren't
grossing everybody out.

21:21.008 --> 21:22.951
Okay, bus jockey, here's how it's gonna go.

21:23.022 --> 21:26.628
You are going to let us on this luxury
motor coach or it is going to get ugly.

21:30.804 --> 21:32.135
Just let it go, ma'am.

21:32.205 --> 21:33.947
For the last time, I didn't hit anybody.

21:34.007 --> 21:36.882
Yeah, I know.
You were just gesturing for emphasis.

21:36.953 --> 21:38.784
Is there a train station around here?

21:38.855 --> 21:41.830
Oh, yeah, sure.
Historical society runs it.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.136
Of course, there hasn't been an actual
train there since the late 1800s.

21:46.248 --> 21:48.050
Butch Cassidy robbed it once!

21:48.110 --> 21:50.484
Oh. How about
a rental car place?

21:50.554 --> 21:54.129
Maybe try Lenny's.
Just up the hill about eight miles.

21:54.199 --> 21:57.303
I'd take you there myself,
but rush hour's starting

21:57.372 --> 22:00.177
and someone's gotta
turn on the traffic light.

22:00.247 --> 22:02.080
But don't worry, you start walking now,

22:02.150 --> 22:03.512
you'll make it there by sundown.

22:05.356 --> 22:07.200
We're gonna miss Christmas.

22:07.260 --> 22:11.406
No, no, Mom. No, we're not!
It's just eight miles!

22:11.476 --> 22:15.313
And then, like, another 800.

22:15.384 --> 22:19.227
Going to be after sundown if you
can't walk and cry at the same time.

22:19.287 --> 22:21.731
How about you show
a little compassion, mister?

22:21.801 --> 22:24.567
Come on.
Oh, this stinks!

22:24.637 --> 22:28.051
Who says I can't walk and cry
at the same time. You watch me!

22:30.886 --> 22:32.929
I bet your father's warm and dry,

22:32.989 --> 22:35.634
and probably snuggled up on
the couch with the kids,

22:35.704 --> 22:37.766
watching a sweet, little Christmas movie.

22:44.786 --> 22:45.957
Oh!

23:42.605 --> 23:43.637
No!

24:07.393 --> 24:10.338
No! No! No! No!

24:12.770 --> 24:14.113
No! No!

24:18.420 --> 24:20.322
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.163
Bob!

24:22.234 --> 24:24.598
What are you doing with my reindeer?

24:25.209 --> 24:27.171
Bad Daddy.

24:27.241 --> 24:30.647
Good girl, Charlie.
At least someone knows how to behave.

24:42.817 --> 24:46.591
Hey, there!
Why the glum look?

24:46.661 --> 24:48.425
Here, have a mint.

24:49.297 --> 24:51.699
Thanks, Grandpa.

24:51.769 --> 24:53.874
I'm just all ripped up inside.

24:53.944 --> 24:56.147
I lost my best friend today.

24:56.217 --> 24:59.593
Oh, I'm so sorry, kiddo.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.067
Oh! What was his name?

25:02.137 --> 25:05.172
Z-Station Deluxe
Home Gaming System.

25:05.242 --> 25:08.045
Oh. Heck,
I got one of those.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.686
What?

25:09.747 --> 25:12.662
Oh, you're the greatest grandpa
in the history of grandpas!

25:12.722 --> 25:14.064
So what games do you have?

25:14.124 --> 25:15.295
Golf.

25:16.437 --> 25:18.041
And?

25:18.101 --> 25:19.242
What more would I need?

25:20.514 --> 25:23.049
Oh, Grandpa, put down your putter.

25:23.118 --> 25:26.565
There's a whole other world out there.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.668
Allow me to introduce you to
the work of Chuck Jablowsky,

25:29.738 --> 25:33.112
one of the greatest video game
designers in human history.

25:34.275 --> 25:36.889
<i>"Galaxy of Death Two"?</i>

25:36.949 --> 25:38.791
What's that got to do with golf?

25:38.851 --> 25:41.896
Absolutely nothing.

25:49.848 --> 25:53.095
Mom, if you cry any louder
you'll trigger an avalanche.

25:54.166 --> 25:56.669
It's Christmas Eve eve, Teddy.

25:56.738 --> 25:58.871
I want to be with my baby.

25:58.941 --> 26:00.845
And my other babies.

26:00.915 --> 26:02.477
And my big daddy baby.

26:02.547 --> 26:04.090
Mom, I will get us there!

26:04.150 --> 26:06.764
I will, but you've got to chill out.

26:06.824 --> 26:09.029
'Cause every five minutes,
you're either punching somebody

26:09.099 --> 26:11.874
or bursting into tears.

26:11.944 --> 26:14.518
Hey, what was with that
star-on-the-tree freak-out yesterday?

26:14.579 --> 26:15.821
Well, that...

26:16.821 --> 26:18.193
Look, it's Lenny's!

26:21.968 --> 26:24.342
We walked eight miles for that?

26:33.467 --> 26:34.770
Hey.

26:34.830 --> 26:37.372
Hi!
You must be Lenny.

26:37.442 --> 26:38.605
Nope. I'm Daryl.

26:39.346 --> 26:40.878
Are you sure about that?

26:40.948 --> 26:43.350
Yeah, I bought Lenny out.

26:44.723 --> 26:46.354
This came with the place.

26:46.424 --> 26:49.300
I thought I'd keep the name
for marketing purposes.

26:49.370 --> 26:52.705
Plus the jumpsuit fit.

26:52.775 --> 26:55.820
Well, sort of.
Lenny's kind of got monkey arms.

26:57.723 --> 26:59.027
Do you rent cars, by any chance?

26:59.097 --> 27:00.529
Let me think.

27:01.099 --> 27:02.973
No.

27:03.033 --> 27:04.805
Y'all need a ride somewhere?

27:04.875 --> 27:06.107
Palm Springs.

27:06.177 --> 27:08.079
Oh, that's a skooch out of my way.

27:08.149 --> 27:11.284
Well, do you know any place
we can rent a car?

27:11.354 --> 27:12.727
Well, if you take this road right here,

27:12.797 --> 27:15.259
and you go about 600 miles
you'll hit Las Vegas.

27:17.604 --> 27:19.346
Aw.

27:19.406 --> 27:21.079
You in a tough spot, hon?

27:21.149 --> 27:23.153
Mmm-hmm.

27:23.222 --> 27:24.854
Tell you what,

27:24.924 --> 27:27.329
I do have an old Yugo I could sell you.

27:27.399 --> 27:28.771
A Yugo?
Mmm-hmm.

27:28.831 --> 27:31.333
What's a Yugo?

27:31.403 --> 27:34.677
It's a car that's 10 years older than you,

27:34.747 --> 27:37.923
built in a country that no longer exists.

27:37.993 --> 27:39.195
It's 50 bucks.

27:40.197 --> 27:41.359
We'll take it.

27:44.303 --> 27:48.681
Okay, 50 bucks.
Yup, worth every penny.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.123
Every penny.

27:51.957 --> 27:55.700
Now, you might want to baby her a little.

27:55.770 --> 27:56.871
She's seen better days.

27:57.433 --> 27:59.105
When?

27:59.175 --> 28:02.080
Hey, Daryl, are you sure it won't
fall apart at 60 miles an hour?

28:02.150 --> 28:05.455
Oh, don't worry, she won't
go near that speed.

28:08.131 --> 28:09.474
Good luck!

28:10.837 --> 28:13.309
Oh, if you're gonna use the radio,

28:13.379 --> 28:14.611
you're gonna need this.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.872
I got you!
I got you!

28:27.650 --> 28:29.884
Oh, they got me!

28:29.954 --> 28:31.988
Yes! You're dead!
Can I play now?

28:32.057 --> 28:34.562
No, it's too late!
I respawned.

28:34.632 --> 28:36.435
Grandpa, that's not fair!

28:36.505 --> 28:38.478
Let me just level up again!

28:38.548 --> 28:40.682
You've been saying that for two hours!

28:40.752 --> 28:42.413
I'm starting to worry about you!

28:42.483 --> 28:44.786
This is really unhealthy.

28:44.855 --> 28:46.828
You love your grandpa, right?

28:46.899 --> 28:48.732
Of course I do.

28:48.803 --> 28:51.375
Then tell me how to
get past the Plains of Fire.

28:52.477 --> 28:53.950
Who do I have to take out first,

28:54.010 --> 28:56.353
the guys in the Tower of Doom,
or the ones on the ground?

28:59.900 --> 29:01.130
Neither.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.635
You sneak around the ridge
and attack from behind.

29:03.706 --> 29:06.610
Plus there's an extra
power-up behind that boulder.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.252
You're a good boy.
Take a mint.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.683
No, I'm good.

29:13.058 --> 29:15.161
Honey. Come on,
don't you want to find out

29:15.232 --> 29:16.534
what happened at the hippos' picnic?

29:17.106 --> 29:18.238
No!

29:18.308 --> 29:19.940
Well, you can't expect her to love books

29:20.011 --> 29:22.054
if you never read to her at home.

29:22.114 --> 29:23.756
I read to her all the time.

29:23.816 --> 29:24.918
Nuh-uh!

29:29.205 --> 29:33.039
Wow, I met so many hot babes at the pool.

29:33.109 --> 29:35.413
Literally, it's, like,
110 degrees out there.

29:36.555 --> 29:37.787
What happened to you?

29:37.857 --> 29:39.588
I fell asleep at the pool for a few hours.

29:39.658 --> 29:41.803
But don't worry, I was wearing this.

29:44.237 --> 29:47.984
PJ, this isn't sunblock.
This is suntan oil!

29:48.054 --> 29:49.455
What's the difference?

29:49.515 --> 29:51.088
One protects your skin
from the harmful rays,

29:51.158 --> 29:54.032
the other fries you like a wonton.

29:54.103 --> 29:57.436
Oh. No wonder I was
feeling a little crispy.

29:57.507 --> 29:59.910
You've just been raising
yourself, haven't you?

29:59.980 --> 30:01.752
You want to come live with us?

30:06.761 --> 30:09.436
Way to get in the Christmas
spirit, Santa Claus!

30:10.709 --> 30:12.843
Gabe!

30:12.912 --> 30:15.818
Sorry. Know what will
make that feel better?

30:15.888 --> 30:17.389
A nice, hot shower.

30:17.459 --> 30:18.591
Really?
Yeah.

30:19.490 --> 30:20.693
The ignorance!

30:20.763 --> 30:23.166
It's like you've been raised by wolves!

30:23.236 --> 30:24.238
Fat wolves.

30:25.781 --> 30:28.746
Man, first I was freezing,
now I'm burning up.

30:28.816 --> 30:30.459
This is not the vacation I dreamed of.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.084
Me neither.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.633
This should be a good
place for a time-out.

30:47.693 --> 30:49.667
I don't think
Charlie needs a time-out.

30:49.736 --> 30:51.910
Of course not!
She's an angel!

30:51.970 --> 30:53.613
I'm talking about you.

30:54.615 --> 30:57.019
Now you just sit there

30:57.089 --> 31:01.165
and think about what it
means to be a good parent.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.340
You want to make cookies with Grandma?

31:03.410 --> 31:04.812
Yay!
Yay!

31:08.145 --> 31:09.316
Bad Daddy.

31:10.358 --> 31:11.520
No cookies.

31:15.266 --> 31:17.569
Oh, this is not happening.

31:25.492 --> 31:26.895
This is happening.

31:37.391 --> 31:39.423
What are you doing?

31:39.493 --> 31:42.138
I think it helps if we lean forward.

31:42.199 --> 31:44.511
Is there any way we can
go around the mountains?

31:44.572 --> 31:48.318
Oh, sure, honey. Just take a left
at Mexico and swing back around.

31:48.388 --> 31:50.893
Sweetie, would you turn the headlights on?

31:50.963 --> 31:52.725
They are on.
No, they're not.

31:52.796 --> 31:55.397
Then we don't have any.

31:55.467 --> 31:57.100
Great.
Let me check the owner's manual.

32:05.663 --> 32:07.526
Ah. What's Serbian
for "headlight"?

32:09.139 --> 32:10.742
Are you sure you don't want me to drive?

32:10.802 --> 32:12.945
No. I can handle it.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.447
I'm a responsible adult,

32:14.517 --> 32:16.320
who can go on Spring Break

32:16.390 --> 32:18.653
without another responsible
adult, because I am one.

32:19.195 --> 32:20.766
Myself.

32:25.072 --> 32:27.745
Hi, honey!
How's your vacation?

32:27.816 --> 32:29.379
Your mother locked me in a bedroom.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.491
Oh, what did you do?

32:30.551 --> 32:32.453
I didn't do anything!

32:32.523 --> 32:35.069
When are you going to get here?

32:35.139 --> 32:37.071
Uh, well, at the speed we're going,

32:37.141 --> 32:38.674
I'd say Groundhog Day.

32:38.744 --> 32:41.017
Please hurry.

32:41.077 --> 32:43.921
Honey, I'm doing the best I can.
We're in a Yugo.

32:43.991 --> 32:47.166
No, no, they're not still making those.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.431
Do you speak Serbian?
No, wait...

32:49.501 --> 32:51.572
Maybe it's Croatian.

32:51.642 --> 32:54.077
You want the kids to translate
it on the Internet?

32:54.147 --> 32:56.652
I suppose I could yell at
them through a heating duct.

32:56.722 --> 33:00.427
The kids! Are they having a good time?
Where are they?

33:00.498 --> 33:03.904
Uh, Charlie's with your mom.
Gabe's with your dad.

33:03.974 --> 33:06.317
And...

33:06.377 --> 33:09.250
Well, sounds like PJ
just got in the shower.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.252
Oh! Mom!
The road's leveling out.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.528
Oh, oh! Gotta go! We're kicking it
up to 10 miles an hour! Love you!

33:14.598 --> 33:15.900
No, no, no. Don't...

33:18.445 --> 33:19.847
Look!

33:19.907 --> 33:22.782
Oh! What a relief.

33:22.852 --> 33:25.856
Okay, it's all downhill
from here. Literally.

33:33.817 --> 33:35.850
Oh. Uh, you can
slow down a little bit.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.023
Yeah, I'm trying.

33:37.093 --> 33:38.754
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
I can't!

33:38.824 --> 33:40.397
Put your foot on the brake!
It's the one on the left!

33:40.467 --> 33:41.830
I know!
It's not working!

33:41.900 --> 33:43.472
Okay, okay, don't panic!

33:43.542 --> 33:44.944
I'm not panicking!

33:49.481 --> 33:53.299
Okay. Okay.
Remember you are an excellent driver.

33:53.369 --> 33:55.031
You really think so?

33:55.101 --> 33:57.734
Right this second, I think it's
very important that you think so.

34:02.881 --> 34:04.223
Okay. Okay.

34:04.293 --> 34:05.596
Try the parking brake!

34:05.656 --> 34:06.798
Oh, great.

34:07.831 --> 34:09.433
Uh, here you go.

34:09.503 --> 34:10.906
What am I supposed to do with this?

34:10.976 --> 34:12.378
Beat Lenny to a pulp with it!

34:12.447 --> 34:13.550
His name is Daryl!

34:14.812 --> 34:16.625
Okay.

34:16.685 --> 34:18.828
On the bright side, it's not snowing.

34:21.701 --> 34:24.004
Oh, why did you have to say that?

34:24.074 --> 34:26.248
I'm sorry!

34:26.308 --> 34:27.949
Turn the windshield wipers on!

34:29.523 --> 34:33.500
Really?
Oh, this is so intense!

34:34.331 --> 34:36.434
Oh, I can barely see!

34:36.504 --> 34:38.878
Oh. Oh. Look, I see
a light up ahead!

34:38.949 --> 34:40.310
Oh, my gosh!
Two lights!

34:41.553 --> 34:42.784
They're headlights!

34:46.558 --> 34:48.732
Okay, okay.
Don't panic!

34:48.802 --> 34:51.036
When the road levels out,
we'll coast to a stop.

34:51.106 --> 34:52.438
When will that be?

34:52.507 --> 34:53.739
Three, maybe four.

34:53.810 --> 34:55.212
Miles?
Hours.

35:14.002 --> 35:16.405
Bang! Bang, you're dead!
I got you!

35:20.411 --> 35:21.984
Bang!
Got you again!

35:25.258 --> 35:27.262
Grandpa!
Five more minutes!

35:28.164 --> 35:29.907
Did you play all night?

35:29.966 --> 35:34.040
Yeah, except I took a pee
break from 4:00 to 4:45.

35:34.110 --> 35:36.715
Then I got stuck in the
Wastelands of Gorlion,

35:36.785 --> 35:39.059
had to go online to find a walkthrough.

35:39.129 --> 35:42.234
Now I'm doing multiplayer
with some kids in Korea.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.885
Grandpa, I can't let you go on like this.

35:59.339 --> 36:00.612
It's for your own good.

36:07.031 --> 36:08.465
Have a mint?

36:10.740 --> 36:12.742
Grandpa, no! Grandpa!

36:18.060 --> 36:20.393
Grandpa's lost his mind!

36:20.463 --> 36:24.809
Well, that's one more thing he
and Grandma have in common.

36:24.869 --> 36:26.682
Are those mints in your hair?

36:26.742 --> 36:28.384
And up my nose.

36:29.487 --> 36:31.620
Come here.
I'm starving.

36:31.690 --> 36:32.832
What?

36:36.508 --> 36:38.441
Really? Oh.

36:39.584 --> 36:41.716
Oh, this is actually not too bad.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.210
Hey, wake up, wake up.
We're burning daylight.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.445
I had the worst dream.

36:56.487 --> 36:58.862
No. It's real.

36:58.922 --> 37:00.533
Let me get my seat up.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.035
I'll help.

37:07.084 --> 37:08.886
Don't break the car.

37:08.946 --> 37:10.788
I'm not going to break the car!
Don't be ridiculous!

37:17.169 --> 37:18.442
There you are.
Thanks.

37:22.889 --> 37:24.251
We can fix that.

37:40.594 --> 37:43.399
But probably not that.

37:45.844 --> 37:48.288
On the bright side, the radio still works.

37:50.089 --> 37:51.352
Not the time.

37:58.011 --> 38:00.013
Well, that's the last of it.

38:01.787 --> 38:04.921
And here's the luggage
that was in the trunk.

38:05.763 --> 38:07.827
I think it was the trunk.

38:07.898 --> 38:11.173
It was a hatchback.
Thank you, Walter.

38:11.244 --> 38:13.977
Oh, I'm not Walter.
I'm Lenny.

38:14.047 --> 38:15.320
I bought Walter out.

38:16.622 --> 38:20.526
Oh, yeah.
He was kind of Hobbit-sized.

38:20.596 --> 38:22.569
Hey, did you have
another garage before that?

38:22.639 --> 38:23.801
Yeah, that you sold to...

38:23.871 --> 38:25.946
Daryl! Yeah!

38:26.016 --> 38:27.647
You ever thought of keeping the jumpsuits,

38:27.717 --> 38:29.350
just switching the name patches?

38:31.293 --> 38:34.068
Never mind.
Do you know how we can get to, um,

38:34.940 --> 38:37.072
anywhere from here?

38:37.142 --> 38:39.376
Oh. Gee, I don't know.

38:39.446 --> 38:41.279
Hitchhike, I guess.

38:41.349 --> 38:42.621
Good luck!

38:44.152 --> 38:45.925
We are not hitchhiking!

38:50.441 --> 38:52.645
Well, Charlie, here we are,

38:52.715 --> 38:54.619
a typical Christmas Eve Day.

38:54.679 --> 38:57.122
Somewhere in the desert.
I think it's Utah.

38:57.192 --> 38:58.325
Who cares?

38:58.395 --> 38:59.857
Oh! And here's Mom.

38:59.927 --> 39:02.100
She's doing a great job not crying

39:02.171 --> 39:03.904
over what a terrible
Christmas we're having.

39:05.315 --> 39:08.348
And she's off.

39:08.419 --> 39:11.122
Gosh, at this rate, we'll
make Las Vegas by lunchtime.

39:11.192 --> 39:13.397
Oh, golly, I'd sure like that!

39:13.467 --> 39:16.029
Mom, Mom. Did you hear that?
They're going to Las Vegas!

39:16.100 --> 39:18.174
If we can get a ride with them,
we can rent a car there!

39:18.244 --> 39:20.848
Teddy, read my lips.
We're not hitchhiking.

39:20.919 --> 39:22.552
Mom, it's only hitchhiking
if they're strangers.

39:22.622 --> 39:24.024
They are strangers.

39:24.094 --> 39:25.395
They won't be as soon as
we buy them breakfast!

39:30.044 --> 39:31.405
Hello. Hi!

39:31.476 --> 39:33.979
Hi, I'm Teddy Duncan, and this is my mom...

39:36.953 --> 39:38.856
This is my mom, Amy.

39:38.926 --> 39:41.300
Howdy.
Sue and Stan McKinney.

39:41.370 --> 39:42.533
Nice to meet you.

39:42.603 --> 39:44.335
Would you mind if we
share the booth with you?

39:44.405 --> 39:46.108
We don't want to be
taking up too much space

39:46.178 --> 39:47.411
once this place gets crowded.

39:47.481 --> 39:49.153
They get a big breakfast rush.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.673
We could just squeeze in here.
Yeah.

39:55.731 --> 39:57.004
That'll probably be good.

39:57.074 --> 39:58.606
Yeah.
Squeezey.

40:02.352 --> 40:05.396
So, couldn't help overhearing,
you guys are headed to Vegas.

40:05.456 --> 40:07.199
What a coincidence!
We're going to Palm Springs!

40:08.171 --> 40:09.302
How's that a coincidence?

40:10.234 --> 40:12.207
Excellent question, Stan.

40:12.277 --> 40:15.051
Um, see, we were heading to Vegas
because we need to rent a car.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.454
Because ours broke,

40:16.523 --> 40:19.158
literally, into thousands of pieces.

40:19.228 --> 40:23.402
Which Lenny, uh... You'd think he was
Walter, but he's actually Lenny...

40:23.472 --> 40:25.336
And he's not Daryl, either.

40:25.406 --> 40:27.078
You might think that Daryl was Lenny,
but really Daryl's just the new Lenny,

40:27.148 --> 40:30.354
and Lenny's Walter.
But really he's just... He's Lenny.

40:30.424 --> 40:33.398
And so anyway, Lenny had to shovel
our car out of the parking lot.

40:37.105 --> 40:39.479
Why don't we order?
It's a great idea.

40:39.549 --> 40:43.255
Okay, uh, I'm gonna have six eggs,
scrambled, side of bacon, side of sausage.

40:43.325 --> 40:44.886
Links or patties?
Both.

40:45.727 --> 40:47.129
Uh, with pancakes.

40:47.199 --> 40:48.863
Regular or silver dollar?

40:48.933 --> 40:53.680
Um, both, uh, with waffles, uh, plus
French toast, and regular toast.

40:53.750 --> 40:56.615
Oh, white, whole wheat, or...
I want all the toast.

40:56.685 --> 41:00.402
Uh, then I'll have some ham, Canadian
bacon, a bear claw, couple of donuts.

41:00.462 --> 41:03.636
Ooh, coffee cake and, uh, a fruit cup.

41:03.707 --> 41:05.640
And, um, cottage cheese.

41:05.710 --> 41:09.413
Low fat, watching my figure.

41:16.204 --> 41:19.139
So, what brings you two to Vegas?

41:19.209 --> 41:21.753
We're headed to a convention, the A.
A. S. N.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.587
Oh, great, great, super, yeah.

41:23.657 --> 41:26.391
We're just hoping to get back to our
loved ones in time for Christmas.

41:26.461 --> 41:28.705
Are you going to eat that?

41:28.765 --> 41:30.907
That's my napkin.
Yeah, but there's jelly on it.

41:34.251 --> 41:37.627
As we were saying, uh, we're afraid that
if we don't make it to Vegas today,

41:37.687 --> 41:40.390
we'll be stranded, alone in the desert,

41:40.460 --> 41:42.935
on this most precious of holidays.

41:43.004 --> 41:44.267
Gee willikers!
You're in a pickle!

41:44.337 --> 41:45.579
Yeah, yeah, we sure are.

41:45.639 --> 41:47.182
We're just hoping for a Christmas miracle

41:47.252 --> 41:49.784
from some kind soul,
who could give us a ride.

41:49.855 --> 41:52.191
Yeah, that's what you need, all right.

41:52.261 --> 41:53.532
Oh, yeah.

41:53.592 --> 41:55.666
We'd be incredibly grateful...
I'll bet!

41:55.736 --> 41:58.438
To anyone and possibly even
somebody we just met,

41:58.508 --> 42:01.613
who's heading to Vegas, has a car...

42:01.683 --> 42:03.516
Especially a four-door...

42:03.586 --> 42:05.259
Oh, yeah, that'd do it, all right.

42:05.329 --> 42:07.132
Oh, for cryin' out loud,
can you give us a ride?

42:18.390 --> 42:20.963
Well, sure!
Why didn't you just ask?

42:22.766 --> 42:24.008
No eatin' in the car, though.

42:24.068 --> 42:26.281
Mmm, wouldn't think of it.

42:26.342 --> 42:29.657
<i>♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way ♪</i>

42:29.717 --> 42:33.333
Whoa! This sunburn ointment
really does the trick.

42:33.393 --> 42:35.367
I feel so much better.

42:35.438 --> 42:39.142
Oh, pumpkin, I think you put
a little bit too much on.

42:39.212 --> 42:41.045
Here, let me dab some of that off.
Okay.

42:41.115 --> 42:43.988
Oh, pepper-pot, I'm so sorry!

42:44.058 --> 42:45.821
It's okay.
Let me just sit down.

42:45.891 --> 42:49.607
The thing is, pudding pop, I can't let
you near the furniture like that.

42:50.468 --> 42:52.411
Well, where can I sit?

42:53.714 --> 42:55.917
Oh!

42:55.987 --> 42:57.459
What are you guys doing in here?

42:59.294 --> 43:01.267
Did... Did Grandma freak out and
send you guys in here, too?

43:01.337 --> 43:03.942
A long time ago, join the club.

43:04.012 --> 43:05.374
Not me.

43:05.443 --> 43:07.945
I'm hiding from Grandpa.
I want my mommy!

43:08.787 --> 43:10.660
Yeah, me too.

43:16.839 --> 43:17.771
I'm good.

43:19.313 --> 43:21.817

43:23.360 --> 43:25.662

43:25.722 --> 43:27.696

43:37.790 --> 43:39.563
Oh, Stan, we're
in a high-gamma zone.

43:39.623 --> 43:41.596
Oh, oh, roger that!
Yeah!

43:43.239 --> 43:46.575
Um, just out of curiosity,
what's with the hats?

43:46.645 --> 43:49.289
Well, you can never
be too careful. No.

43:49.349 --> 43:51.292
Do they seem a little weird to you?

43:51.363 --> 43:54.096
Yeah, almost as weird as you
eating a napkin for dessert.

43:54.166 --> 43:55.338
Don't.

43:56.538 --> 43:57.570
You okay?

43:57.640 --> 43:58.772
Not really.

43:59.943 --> 44:03.519
I need a bag.
Mom, not again!

44:03.589 --> 44:05.322
Are you ladies okay back there?

44:05.392 --> 44:09.270
Uh, yeah! Hey, why don't you
tell me about your convention!

44:09.340 --> 44:13.046
Oh, well, we go every year.
It's a real humdinger!

44:13.116 --> 44:14.618
Oh, I bet!

44:14.688 --> 44:16.692
You know, it's just
so nice to be among folks

44:16.751 --> 44:18.695
who've had the same experience you had.

44:18.765 --> 44:20.727
I can imagine!

44:20.797 --> 44:23.099
Because, you know, if it hasn't
happened to you, you just don't get it.

44:23.169 --> 44:24.772
No! Totally! It's...
Give it to me.

44:24.842 --> 44:26.344
What is it again?

44:26.415 --> 44:27.577
Alien abduction.

44:31.193 --> 44:32.425
Mmm?

44:34.999 --> 44:37.273
I'm sorry, did you just say...

44:37.343 --> 44:39.276
Alien abduction!

44:39.346 --> 44:41.380
That's what A. A. S. N. is.

44:41.450 --> 44:43.693
The Alien Abduction Survivor's Network.

44:45.063 --> 44:47.627
So, which one of you...
Oh, we both were.

44:49.140 --> 44:50.402
That's where we met first.

44:50.472 --> 44:53.646
Yeah!
Aboard the spaceship.

44:53.716 --> 44:54.879
'Course, we didn't know it at the time.

44:54.949 --> 44:57.452
Oh, no, no!
Not until years later,

44:57.522 --> 45:00.628
after hypnosis recovered
our repressed memories.

45:02.339 --> 45:03.973
Oh, gosh!

45:05.916 --> 45:08.077
Sweetheart, are you okay?

45:08.147 --> 45:11.752
I'm just a little nauseous.

45:11.822 --> 45:17.072
You know, that's the single most
common side-effect of an abduction.

45:17.142 --> 45:19.847
And that increase
in appetite you're having?

45:19.917 --> 45:22.652
Now, that's the second
most common side-effect.

45:22.722 --> 45:25.726
Oh, believe me, I've been
this way for a while.

45:25.796 --> 45:30.304
I mean, I think I would remember
if aliens had abducted me.

45:30.373 --> 45:34.649
Oh, no, sweetheart, that's how it works!
You never remember.

45:34.719 --> 45:35.950
Not at first.

45:36.020 --> 45:39.556
Have you experienced
an episode of lost time?

45:39.626 --> 45:43.002
Uh, you mean, besides the eighteen
years since my kids were born?

45:43.072 --> 45:45.576
Oh, trust me, she wasn't
abducted by aliens.

45:45.647 --> 45:46.979
We were together all last
night in the mountains.

45:47.049 --> 45:50.023
That's where they get you!

45:50.093 --> 45:52.458
Oh, I wonder if you've been tagged.

45:53.900 --> 45:55.332
Why don't we probe them and find out?

45:55.402 --> 45:57.504
No, no, no, don't probe them.
No, no! No probe.

45:57.573 --> 46:02.081
Okay, we'll use the drill.
That'll leave a scar.

46:02.151 --> 46:05.055
No, no, no, no, no, no!

46:05.125 --> 46:06.698
That is not necessary, okay.

46:06.769 --> 46:10.475
I promise you, we have not
been abducted by aliens.

46:10.545 --> 46:14.051
That big appetite, on top of the nausea,

46:14.121 --> 46:18.697
now, you have either been abducted
by aliens or you're pregnant!

46:22.803 --> 46:24.205
Surprise!

46:51.507 --> 46:53.650
Got everything here.

46:53.710 --> 46:56.285
Well, good luck, Merry Christmas.

46:56.355 --> 46:59.530
Oh, Merry Christmas, Stan.
Bye.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.903
Are you sure you're not
carrying an alien baby?

47:01.973 --> 47:06.180
Ah, yeah, I'm pretty sure my
obstetrician would've caught that.

47:06.250 --> 47:09.023
Well, if you change your
mind, we're in the book!

47:09.083 --> 47:12.027
Bye, honey!
Bye.

47:12.098 --> 47:15.372
Under "O," for
"Out of your mind."

47:15.432 --> 47:16.734
Bye!

47:16.804 --> 47:18.879
Okay, honey, will you watch our stuff?

47:18.949 --> 47:20.312
I have to go to the bathroom.

47:20.382 --> 47:22.686
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!
Can we talk about you being pregnant?

47:22.756 --> 47:23.988
And not telling me?

47:24.057 --> 47:26.701
Teddy, honey, I wanted to, but...

47:26.761 --> 47:28.104
You know, your father and I decided

47:28.174 --> 47:30.607
to tell the whole family
at once on Christmas Day.

47:30.677 --> 47:33.210
Excuse me, can you spare
some change for food?

47:33.281 --> 47:34.612
Oh, yeah.

47:36.054 --> 47:37.357
Here.
Thank you.

47:39.460 --> 47:40.662
How could this happen?

47:40.732 --> 47:41.834
I think you know how this happened.

47:41.905 --> 47:42.937
I mean, you saw the film in health class.

47:43.007 --> 47:44.178
I signed the permission slip.

47:44.238 --> 47:46.582
But five kids, really?

47:46.652 --> 47:49.056
Look, we will discuss this after I pee.

47:49.127 --> 47:51.861
It was a really long car ride.
You just watch our luggage.

47:54.264 --> 47:55.466
Where is our luggage?

47:56.636 --> 47:57.738
Oh, no!

48:04.127 --> 48:06.161
Hi, there!

48:06.231 --> 48:10.739
So, uh, underneath all this medicated ointment,
there's actually a very sensitive guy.

48:10.809 --> 48:12.782
May I offer you ladies a banana chip?

48:16.958 --> 48:19.231
Wow, it's hard to believe that didn't work.

48:27.412 --> 48:29.456
Isn't this great, finally
something she can't break.

48:40.615 --> 48:41.986
Hey, honey, you almost here?

48:43.318 --> 48:45.230
You what?

48:45.291 --> 48:46.793
No, no, no, no, no!
You know what?

48:46.863 --> 48:49.367
You stay there, I'm gonna come get you.

48:49.437 --> 48:51.509
I don't know.

48:51.580 --> 48:53.643
We'll leave as soon as I can convince
your father to lend me the car.

48:53.713 --> 48:55.355
So, I'll see you when I see you.

48:55.416 --> 48:57.660
Okay, love you too.

48:57.730 --> 48:58.893
What's up?

48:58.963 --> 49:01.035
I gotta go pick up your mom and Teddy.

49:01.105 --> 49:03.008
You guys need to stay here
with Grandma and Grandpa.

49:03.069 --> 49:04.371
No, no, no!

49:04.441 --> 49:05.643
Take us with you.
Don't leave us here.

49:05.713 --> 49:07.285
Please, please,
please! Please!

49:12.130 --> 49:13.894
All right!

49:13.964 --> 49:17.269
Oh, good! You're just in time
to have more Christmas cookies!

49:17.339 --> 49:20.314
Except you.
You're still being punished.

49:20.385 --> 49:23.119
Petunia, Amy and Teddy
are stranded in Vegas!

49:23.189 --> 49:25.062
Oh, the poor things!
Are they okay?

49:25.132 --> 49:28.168
Oh, they're fine. I just...
I need to borrow your car, so I can go get them.

49:28.238 --> 49:30.570
Hank, there's an emergency.

49:30.640 --> 49:33.944
You have to drive into Las
Vegas and pick up the girls!

49:34.014 --> 49:35.717
Wait till I finish this level!

49:35.787 --> 49:38.362
I can see the Stone of Mitrios!

49:38.422 --> 49:40.764
He's not coming out of there any time soon.

49:40.834 --> 49:43.338
All right, guys, got get a
change of clothes, we're going.

49:43.409 --> 49:46.213
You're leaving me here
alone on Christmas Eve?

49:46.284 --> 49:47.646
Well...

49:48.888 --> 49:50.359
Not entirely.

49:50.419 --> 49:53.135
Look, I haven't got time to
make that car seat work,

49:53.195 --> 49:54.597
could you watch her while I'm gone?

49:55.268 --> 49:56.669
Of course I can.

49:56.739 --> 49:58.512
I always knew this day would come.

50:01.646 --> 50:03.960
Okay.

50:04.020 --> 50:07.365
Hey, sweetie, we're going
to be back soon, okay?

50:07.436 --> 50:09.039
I promise, all of us.

50:09.099 --> 50:10.041
Mama.

50:12.144 --> 50:14.148
Please make sure she has
a nice Christmas Eve.

50:14.218 --> 50:15.821
Of course, I will.

50:15.891 --> 50:17.793
We'll have a fabulous time...
Bye, Daddy.

50:18.724 --> 50:19.666
Bye-bye, sweetie.

50:25.414 --> 50:28.287
Oh, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, wait!

50:28.347 --> 50:30.251
Wait, how do I keep her
from breaking things?

50:31.863 --> 50:34.539
It's easy.
Just tell her not to touch them.

50:39.075 --> 50:41.049
I told you to watch our bags!

50:41.119 --> 50:42.492
I'm not the one who wandered off!

50:42.552 --> 50:44.222
Well, I had to pee!

50:44.292 --> 50:46.996
Well, I still have to pee!

50:47.066 --> 50:51.914
This is great, yep, no luggage, no
purse, no money and I'm starving!

50:51.974 --> 50:54.248
It could be worse.
That's hard to see how!

50:54.318 --> 50:56.121
I hope that plane
ticket was worth it, Teddy.

50:56.191 --> 50:58.725
Okay, you know, I did my
best to get us out of this.

50:58.795 --> 51:00.629
And you haven't exactly been helpful!

51:00.699 --> 51:03.805
Well, that's because you wanted to
prove how responsible you were!

51:03.875 --> 51:05.578
Mom, I'm not the parent!

51:05.648 --> 51:07.550
I'm not the one who's actually
supposed to be responsible!

51:07.620 --> 51:09.892
And I'm not the one who ruined Christmas!

51:15.570 --> 51:18.105
Oh, Teddy... That's the meanest
thing you've ever said to me!

51:18.175 --> 51:20.278
What? Do you think
I wanted to ruin Christmas?

51:20.348 --> 51:23.223
I already feel awful!
And you just want me to feel worse!

51:23.293 --> 51:25.225
No, no, no!
Teddy, come back!

51:25.296 --> 51:26.427
Leave me alone!

51:27.128 --> 51:28.201

54:57.229 --> 54:58.692
Up where?

54:58.762 --> 55:00.435
There's a little unmarked
road about 100 yards ahead.

55:00.505 --> 55:02.839
Trust me!
I mapped it out!

55:02.909 --> 55:06.544
Oh, if we took that road, it would've

months, work out the bugs.

57:16.671 --> 57:17.773

57:29.643 --> 57:31.144
Yeah?

57:34.218 --> 57:35.190
It's hard.

57:36.291 --> 57:38.596
What, Mom?
What is hard?

57:39.497 --> 57:40.428
Letting go.

57:42.872 --> 57:46.617

57:51.024 --> 57:53.769

57:53.840 --> 57:57.344

it's not like you're going to run out.

58:08.773 --> 58:12.078
Hey, you did not ruin Christmas.

58:13.120 --> 58:15.093
At least we're together.

58:15.153 --> 58:17.227
We can still have pancakes
on Christmas morning,

58:17.296 --> 58:20.431
even if they're six hours
old under a heat lamp.

58:20.499 --> 58:23.073
And they're not shaped
like Christmas trees.

58:23.144 --> 58:27.080
Teddy, you gave me the best present ever!

58:29.022 --> 58:30.555

58:41.023 --> 58:42.294

58:42.355 --> 58:44.328
She's wearing my purple top!

58:44.398 --> 58:45.999
E e looks better in it than I do!

58:46.069 --> 58:47.800
Hey, wait.
We need a plan.

58:48.702 --> 58:49.974

58:54.822 --> 58:55.994
All right, the jig is up.

58:56.054 --> 58:57.626

58:58.899 --> 59:01.474
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

59:01.544 --> 59:02.846

59:02.906 --> 59:04.409
'cause we're calling the cops.

59:04.480 --> 59:07.753
No, I swear, I've never done
anything like this before, ever!

59:07.824 --> 59:11.127
I just didn't know what else
to do because I was so hungry.

59:11.198 --> 59:15.675
And I just saw your luggage sitting
there, and I haven't eaten in so long.

59:15.744 --> 59:17.908
Could you please stop crying
so I can call the cops?

59:17.978 --> 59:19.581
I'm sorry!

59:19.651 --> 59:22.024
I'm just so tired and I'm lost

59:22.084 --> 59:24.429
and all I want to do is just go home

59:24.499 --> 59:27.903
but I can't because it's
like a thousand miles away.

59:27.973 --> 59:29.646
And I don't have any money.

59:29.706 --> 59:30.848
How did that happen?

59:32.820 --> 59:34.282
It's a really long story.

59:35.523 --> 59:36.995
We've got time.

59:40.371 --> 59:43.347
Hold still!
It won't help to struggle.

59:45.479 --> 59:47.353
All right, take the blindfolds off.

59:47.423 --> 59:49.556
Okay.

59:49.627 --> 59:52.762
Whatever it is you guys want...
You kn w what we want!

59:52.832 --> 59:54.104
To keep the Stone of Mitrios

59:54.173 --> 59:55.906
out of your dirty yellow hands!

59:55.976 --> 59:58.578
I have no idea what you're
talking about. I do!

59:58.648 --> 59:59.950
Gabe, please!

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:01.954
Look, we're innocent.

01:00:02.024 --> 01:00:04.227
We were just on our way to pick
up my wife and my daughter...

01:00:04.297 --> 01:00:07.973
Down an unmarked desert road,
after dark, on Christmas Eve?

01:00:08.033 --> 01:00:09.677
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:00:09.747 --> 01:00:12.052
I have a PhD from Caltech!

01:00:12.112 --> 01:00:15.787
Really? Oh, then you're smart enough
to know that kidnapping is a felony.

01:00:18.432 --> 01:00:21.605
Good one.
You're very convincing.

01:00:21.675 --> 01:00:24.378
Look, you tell Jablowsky,
whatever trick he was trying

01:00:24.448 --> 01:00:26.312
to pull with you, it didn't work.

01:00:26.382 --> 01:00:29.386
We are going to grind you under our boots.

01:00:29.456 --> 01:00:32.632
And there's no way
you're getting the Stone.

01:00:32.702 --> 01:00:34.405
We don't even know what that is!

01:00:34.475 --> 01:00:36.279
I do!

01:00:36.339 --> 01:00:38.011
And we're going to miss Christmas!
What did you say?

01:00:38.081 --> 01:00:40.014
I know exactly what's happening!

01:00:40.085 --> 01:00:42.058
We're in the middle of Live Death!

01:00:42.128 --> 01:00:43.789
Which is?

01:00:43.859 --> 01:00:45.431
Okay, so every Christmas
Eve, Chuck Jablowsky,

01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:48.535
<i>the multi-gazillionaire
who invented Galaxy of Death,</i>

01:00:48.605 --> 01:00:51.581
he hosts this legendary paintball
tournament based on the game.

01:00:51.651 --> 01:00:53.613
It's like a giant video game come to life!

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.587
Why does he do it on Christmas Eve?

01:00:55.657 --> 01:00:57.930
Because half the programme
who work for him are Hindu.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.805
And the other half are antisocial
nerds who have no life.

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:03.639
I'm starting to realize why there
weren't any hot girls in that crowd.

01:01:03.709 --> 01:01:05.952
Yeah, it's a shame.

01:01:06.013 --> 01:01:07.555
How long does the game last?

01:01:07.615 --> 01:01:10.188
Until either the Yellow team
captures the Stone of Mitrios,

01:01:10.257 --> 01:01:11.859
or the Red team wipes them all out.

01:01:11.929 --> 01:01:13.703
Usually takes a couple of days.

01:01:13.763 --> 01:01:15.706
So we're stuck here till after Christmas?

01:01:15.776 --> 01:01:17.510
Well, not if we escape!

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.454
All right, you know what, let's
scoot our chairs back to back

01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:22.187
and then, maybe we could
untie the ropes, all right.

01:01:22.257 --> 01:01:23.330
Here we go.

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:24.862
All right, working already, huh?

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:26.534
Wait, no, Dad.
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad...

01:01:26.635 --> 01:01:28.108
No, no, no, no! Ow.
Ow

01:01:28.168 --> 01:01:29.240
Gabe, you bumped me out of position!

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:31.482
You bumped me!
Sit still!

01:01:31.542 --> 01:01:33.754
This was my idea!
Let me do what I got to do!

01:01:33.814 --> 01:01:36.688
Yes, but I'm smaller and more agile!

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:38.492
Well, I'm bigger and you
need to listen to me!

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:39.634
Dad's right.

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:42.638
How did you get free?

01:01:42.708 --> 01:01:45.384
My arms are all lubed up
with sunburn ointment.

01:01:45.443 --> 01:01:46.755
Slipped them right out.

01:01:47.888 --> 01:01:49.489
Untie us!

01:01:49.559 --> 01:01:50.931
Oh, yeah, yeah!

01:01:52.635 --> 01:01:54.538
Wow, that's really easy to undo.

01:01:54.608 --> 01:01:57.310
I guess Caltech doesn't have
a knot tying requirement.

01:01:59.713 --> 01:02:02.117
All right, let's go.

01:02:02.188 --> 01:02:07.236
Wait, wait, wait...
We might have to shoot our way out.

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:08.910
Good idea.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:10.682
Here goes.

01:02:11.915 --> 01:02:13.557
Yes!
All right!

01:02:13.617 --> 01:02:15.089
Okay, boys, are we ready?

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.593
Yeah!
All right!

01:02:16.663 --> 01:02:20.806
On three.
One, two, three!

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:27.258
Wow. Okay, on three.
One, two, three!

01:02:27.318 --> 01:02:30.192
One, two, three!

01:02:30.262 --> 01:02:32.466
Come on!
Allow me.

01:02:37.984 --> 01:02:38.915
Thank you.

01:02:42.261 --> 01:02:43.462
Nobody in here.

01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:55.960
Hey, remember us?

01:02:56.021 --> 01:02:57.063
Where's our car?

01:02:57.133 --> 01:02:58.765
Can't talk, already dead!

01:02:58.835 --> 01:03:00.339
Oh, come on!

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:03.213
Rules are rules for
a reason, okay, l? l?

01:03:03.273 --> 01:03:05.917
Give us a break, man!
It's Christmas Eve!

01:03:05.987 --> 01:03:07.288
We're not like you!
We have lives!

01:03:07.358 --> 01:03:09.360
Hey, man, I chose to be here!

01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:10.692
Yeah.

01:03:10.762 --> 01:03:12.735
Guys, you gotta check out this map!

01:03:12.796 --> 01:03:15.240
Oh, does it prove I was
right about the shortcut?

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.943
Oh, other than the part
where we got kidnapped?

01:03:18.013 --> 01:03:20.087
Can you find our car on this thing?

01:03:20.147 --> 01:03:22.462
I think it's over there,
past the Tower of Doom.

01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.826
But we're deep in Red team territory.

01:03:24.896 --> 01:03:27.369
If we run for it, we'll probably
just get kidnapped again.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.215
On the other hand...
What?

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.848
Their whole strategy's
outlined in this plan.

01:03:33.919 --> 01:03:35.791
<i>And it's right out
of Galaxy of Death.</i>

01:03:35.862 --> 01:03:37.765
I know exactly how
this is going to play out.

01:03:39.437 --> 01:03:41.400
So can you get us to the car?

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:43.545
Dad, I can do better than that.

01:03:44.977 --> 01:03:47.320
I think I can win this thing.

01:03:49.995 --> 01:03:53.301
So, I really wanted to go
to this music festival.

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.943
But my mom said I was too
young and irresponsible

01:03:56.014 --> 01:03:58.076
to go cross-country
without an adult.

01:03:58.146 --> 01:03:59.388
Mmm, I've heard that before.

01:03:59.448 --> 01:04:01.250
I've said that before.

01:04:01.321 --> 01:04:04.525
So, we got in this huge fight, of course,
because we fight about everything.

01:04:04.595 --> 01:04:09.043
My clothes, my grades, my nose piercing,
which actually she was right about,

01:04:09.113 --> 01:04:11.417
because I still can't smell on this side.

01:04:11.477 --> 01:04:13.119
Lesson learned.
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:13.189 --> 01:04:15.021
So, she said that if
I went to the festival,

01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:17.595
then I might as well not
even bother coming home.

01:04:18.467 --> 01:04:20.969
And I went anyway.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.215
And then my ride ditched me,
and I wound up stranded here.

01:04:25.275 --> 01:04:27.249
Well, did you call your mom?

01:04:27.319 --> 01:04:30.464
But she said she'd never forgive me.

01:04:30.524 --> 01:04:34.270
Well, you know, sometimes moms say
things they don't really mean.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.174
Yeah, we do, all the time.

01:04:36.244 --> 01:04:37.746
I once told Teddy if she
didn't clean her room,

01:04:37.817 --> 01:04:39.519
she'd have to sleep outside in the yard.

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:41.293
I did have to sleep outside in the yard.
It was summer.

01:04:41.353 --> 01:04:43.826
Look, the point is, it's Christmas Eve.

01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:46.329
Call your mom.

01:04:46.398 --> 01:04:49.303
I can't.
I'm too scared.

01:04:50.746 --> 01:04:52.047
Do you want me to call her?

01:04:54.551 --> 01:04:59.130
Hi, Brenda?
This is Amy Duncan.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.344
This is going to take
a little bit of explaining.

01:05:03.215 --> 01:05:05.049
It's going to be fine.

01:05:05.119 --> 01:05:08.254
I don't know, my mom can
be pretty nuts sometimes.

01:05:08.324 --> 01:05:10.196
Yeah, well, they all can.

01:05:10.266 --> 01:05:13.370
I don't know, your mom seems really chill.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.245
My mom wants to turn our arguments
into a Broadway musical.

01:05:18.518 --> 01:05:20.952
Wow, that is nuts.
Yep!

01:05:21.022 --> 01:05:23.827
What a coincidence!
I have four kids, too!

01:05:23.897 --> 01:05:27.834
Oh, my gosh! I'm pregnant, too, hah!
It's like we're twins!

01:05:27.904 --> 01:05:29.076
<i>Do you watch
The Bachelor?</i>

01:05:29.146 --> 01:05:31.208
I know, isn't she heinous?

01:05:31.278 --> 01:05:32.651
I can't believe he picked her.

01:05:32.721 --> 01:05:34.152
You know what, though?

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:38.128
Underneath all that craziness
they really do love us.

01:05:38.198 --> 01:05:40.831
And reality TV.
Yeah, that too.

01:05:42.304 --> 01:05:44.407
Hang on.

01:05:44.477 --> 01:05:48.094
Jordan, here's someone who
wants to talk to you.

01:05:56.447 --> 01:05:58.379
Hi, Mom.
How did it go?

01:05:58.448 --> 01:06:00.781
<i>Oh, we totally agreed about
the girl in The chelor.</i>

01:06:00.851 --> 01:06:03.526
Oh, no, I mean, do you think
they're going to make up?

01:06:03.596 --> 01:06:05.329
I miss you, too.

01:06:07.644 --> 01:06:09.046
I think they just did.

01:06:10.709 --> 01:06:12.252
Okay.

01:06:14.325 --> 01:06:15.898
I love you too, Mom!

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.362
I'll see you soon.

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.383
Everything okay?

01:06:27.825 --> 01:06:29.195
Thank you so much!

01:06:29.256 --> 01:06:31.099
Oh, you're so welcome.

01:06:32.371 --> 01:06:33.934
So, you headed to the airport?

01:06:35.247 --> 01:06:37.581
You are going home, right?

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:39.312
Yeah, yeah, it's just...

01:06:39.383 --> 01:06:42.458
The plane fare's a little too
much for my mom to handle.

01:06:42.528 --> 01:06:44.361
So, I'm just going
to find a shelter tonight.

01:06:44.431 --> 01:06:47.004
And then figure out some way to
get enough money for a bus fare.

01:06:48.905 --> 01:06:51.150
But, don't worry.
I'm not going to steal anything.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:52.852
No, no, no, it's not that, um...

01:06:58.702 --> 01:07:00.175
I want you to have this.

01:07:01.177 --> 01:07:02.239
What is it?

01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:03.952
It's a plane ticket.

01:07:04.884 --> 01:07:06.286
No, no!
Yeah!

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:07.556
No, I can't!

01:07:07.626 --> 01:07:09.027
Yeah, it's brought me a lot of trouble.

01:07:09.087 --> 01:07:11.532
But, f f it gets you home for
Christmas, then it's worth it.

01:07:14.336 --> 01:07:15.508
Thank you.

01:07:22.999 --> 01:07:23.931
Thanks again.

01:07:25.263 --> 01:07:26.935
Oh, my gosh!
You need your top back!

01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:29.440
No, no, no, keep it! It looks better
on you, than it ever did on me.

01:07:30.752 --> 01:07:32.284
Well, thanks again, again!

01:07:33.584 --> 01:07:35.386
Merry Christmas!

01:07:35.456 --> 01:07:36.928
Merry Christmas!

01:07:40.004 --> 01:07:41.165
Bye!

01:07:44.611 --> 01:07:48.759
I am so proud of you.
That was such a grown-up thing you just did.

01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:50.391
Grown-up enough
to go on Spring Break?

01:07:50.462 --> 01:07:53.106
Yeah, if you had a ticket!

01:07:53.166 --> 01:07:55.178
That's painfully ironic.
Yeah!

01:08:02.629 --> 01:08:06.765
Hey, are you sure this is the place
where we're supposed to meet Dad?

01:08:06.835 --> 01:08:08.778
He's not answering his phone.

01:08:08.838 --> 01:08:10.282
You know what?
I'll just text him.

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:14.318
Stay together.
Let's move, let's move!

01:08:14.388 --> 01:08:16.231
Bravo team, head on a swivel.

01:08:18.365 --> 01:08:19.937
Guard the right perimeter.

01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:36.072
Dad, when you're in the kill zone,
you gotta keep it on vibrate!

01:08:36.142 --> 01:08:38.215
I hate vibrate!
It tickles.

01:08:39.185 --> 01:08:40.358
What are you doing?

01:08:40.419 --> 01:08:43.492
I am texting your mother back.

01:08:43.562 --> 01:08:46.765
Hey, there is no texting in the kill zone!

01:08:46.836 --> 01:08:49.109
PJ.
Got it.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:52.515
These nerds go down easy.

01:08:52.585 --> 01:08:55.359
Dad! Come on! We're almost
through the Plains of Fire!

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.635
You could practically see the
Wastelands of Gorlion from here!

01:08:58.705 --> 01:09:02.240
Wait a minute. We are going
straight to the car, correct?

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:05.685
Yeah! Yeah, Dad, it's
just past the Wastelands.

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.991
Is it?
No!

01:09:13.935 --> 01:09:16.109
Oh, my gosh, it's your father!

01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:21.260
"Running late, can't call or text
from the kill zone. Love you, BRB."

01:09:22.321 --> 01:09:24.194
That's random.

01:09:24.265 --> 01:09:26.298
Well, so much for us all
spending Christmas together.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:29.974
Hey, we will be together!

01:09:30.044 --> 01:09:31.986
You know, we know what
route they're taking.

01:09:32.046 --> 01:09:34.448
We'll rent a car and meet them halfway.
Come on!

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.692
- Wow.
- Let's go.

01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:38.024
You go, girlfriend!

01:09:39.767 --> 01:09:41.599
Lady Luck Car Rental.

01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:44.173
"Open 364 days a year."

01:09:46.188 --> 01:09:48.992
Oh, God, it's after midnight.
Nothing's going to be open!

01:09:51.796 --> 01:09:53.069
What about that place?

01:09:58.716 --> 01:10:00.888
Oh, hey!
Merry Christmas!

01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:02.892
Merry Christmas to you!
Thank you.

01:10:02.962 --> 01:10:05.666
You know, I knew if I stayed open
all night long on Christmas,

01:10:05.736 --> 01:10:07.139
it would pay off.

01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:09.003
Yeah, the thing is,

01:10:09.073 --> 01:10:11.818
we were hoping you knew of a rental
car place that might be open.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.322
Oh.

01:10:14.392 --> 01:10:17.167
Well, you see, that's the
trouble with car places.

01:10:17.227 --> 01:10:18.869
There's no culture of commitment.

01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:20.501
That's why I sold my garage

01:10:20.571 --> 01:10:23.244
moved to Vegas, I bought
this place from Gary...

01:10:23.314 --> 01:10:26.079
- Uh, it, so you're not Gary?
- No!

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:27.252
No, no. My name is...

01:10:27.292 --> 01:10:29.464
Wait! Don't tell us
Are you Walter??

01:10:29.524 --> 01:10:31.328
How'd you guess that?

01:10:31.398 --> 01:10:34.943
Oh, we used your old garage a few
hundred miles back for towing...

01:10:35.003 --> 01:10:37.016
Actually, shoveling.

01:10:37.076 --> 01:10:39.279
Wow, imagine that!
Say, how's Lenny doin'?

01:10:39.349 --> 01:10:40.452
- He's great.
- Great.

01:10:40.522 --> 01:10:42.525
- Doing great.
- So's Daryl.

01:10:42.595 --> 01:10:44.298
- Oh, you know Daryl?
- Yeah.

01:10:44.368 --> 01:10:47.341
- Amazing.
- Yeah, yeah, it really has been.

01:10:47.401 --> 01:10:49.704
Ah, so listen, Walter,
my family's Christmas

01:10:49.774 --> 01:10:52.679
depends on our not being in
Vegas when the sun comes up.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:55.123
Uh-huh.
So, what's our best bet?

01:11:17.816 --> 01:11:20.451
Really thought we would've
come across them by now.

01:11:22.194 --> 01:11:23.427
Let's take a rest.

01:11:37.928 --> 01:11:40.072
Merry Christmas, baby.

01:11:40.142 --> 01:11:41.904
Merry Christmas, Mama.

01:11:46.692 --> 01:11:48.626
I hope the guys are okay.

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:51.530
Wherever they are.

01:11:56.418 --> 01:11:58.179
There's something over here.

01:11:58.249 --> 01:12:01.825
<i>♪ I'm looking for a sign</i>

01:12:01.895 --> 01:12:04.629
<i>♪ To show me that I'm right</i>

01:12:04.699 --> 01:12:07.574
<i>♪ On cue to break the fall</i>

01:12:07.644 --> 01:12:10.548
<i>♪ When our back's
against the wall</i>

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:14.093
<i>♪ So I'll take it as it comes</i>

01:12:14.154 --> 01:12:18.030
<i>♪ I'll show off anyone who
thinks I'll take it slow</i>

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.502
Go! Go! Go!

01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:34.003
Everybody on the ridge.
On the ridge!

01:12:35.005 --> 01:12:36.678
Move! Move!

01:12:36.749 --> 01:12:38.281
<i>♪ You better believe</i>

01:12:38.351 --> 01:12:40.955
<i>♪ I'm not going away ♪</i>

01:12:55.226 --> 01:12:56.999
PJ!

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.101
Dad!

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.909
Do it for Dad!

01:14:02.628 --> 01:14:05.863
Yes! Yes! Yeah!

01:14:05.933 --> 01:14:08.538
The Stone of Mitrios is mine!

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:13.457
So close, too.

01:14:13.527 --> 01:14:16.332
Who are you?
You're not even in the game!

01:14:16.402 --> 01:14:19.366
Oh, yeah? Then why am I
holding the Stone of Mitrios?

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.282
Here comes Jablowsky.

01:14:25.183 --> 01:14:26.987
He's gonna crush you!

01:14:27.057 --> 01:14:29.229
Well, actually, he's gonna
pay a guy to crush you.

01:14:33.939 --> 01:14:35.481
Chuck Jablowsky.

01:14:37.584 --> 01:14:41.661
Do you know what happens to people
that crash my paintball game?

01:14:41.731 --> 01:14:45.036
You send them on their way with a
severe scolding and a free smart phone?

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.067
No, I pay a guy to crush them.

01:14:47.137 --> 01:14:48.508
Told you so.

01:14:48.578 --> 01:14:51.143
Unless you're wearing my team uniform,

01:14:51.214 --> 01:14:53.157
in which case, I win!

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:56.993
That's my boy!

01:14:57.063 --> 01:15:01.011
I'm the guy that lets him slack off
homework so he can play the game.

01:15:01.071 --> 01:15:04.747
Sir, thank you so much for not
paying a guy to crush us.

01:15:04.817 --> 01:15:06.189
And may I say it's a huge honor

01:15:06.259 --> 01:15:08.892
just to shake your bizarrely small hand.

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:11.465
The pleasure's all mine, kid.
You won the game for me!

01:15:11.535 --> 01:15:12.907
What can I do to repay you?

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:15.071
I believe a smart phone was mentioned.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.217
Actually, we need a lift.

01:15:23.093 --> 01:15:25.798
Any chance the cook can make pancakes
shaped like Christmas trees?

01:15:25.868 --> 01:15:27.539
He can barely make them round.

01:15:32.588 --> 01:15:35.720
I'm sorry you didn't get to watch
Charlie put the star on the tree.

01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:39.666
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.
We'll have other Christmases.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.641
How did you guys...

01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:56.343
A buddy of mine triangulated your
cell phones and gave us a lift.

01:15:56.413 --> 01:15:57.644
No way!

01:15:58.245 --> 01:15:59.386
Thank you!

01:16:00.588 --> 01:16:02.322
Bye! Thank you!

01:16:02.993 --> 01:16:04.295
Thanks!

01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:09.545
How did you guys get here?

01:16:09.615 --> 01:16:11.287
Oh, you see that tandem bike?
Yeah.

01:16:11.347 --> 01:16:13.992
We rode it here.
From Las Vegas.

01:16:14.061 --> 01:16:15.723
Wow, that's like...
Ninety miles.

01:16:17.497 --> 01:16:19.300
My butt hurts.

01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:22.043
I just wish my parents
and Charlie were here.

01:16:22.113 --> 01:16:23.374
Hey!

01:16:25.016 --> 01:16:26.118
Hey!

01:16:26.188 --> 01:16:27.551
Hi!

01:16:27.621 --> 01:16:28.993
Hi!

01:16:29.063 --> 01:16:30.325
Hey!

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:35.073
Hey, there's my girl!

01:16:35.143 --> 01:16:37.417
Hi!
Charlie!

01:16:37.487 --> 01:16:40.121
Who left my baby in the
middle of the desert?

01:16:40.191 --> 01:16:42.065
There we go!

01:16:42.124 --> 01:16:43.866
Good thing I took that shortcut,
or I never would have...

01:16:43.926 --> 01:16:48.712
Hole in one!
Is that the Stone of Mitrios?

01:16:48.772 --> 01:16:50.877
The real thing.
Did you finish the game?

01:16:50.947 --> 01:16:54.191
Yeah, I did. I got thumb blisters
like you wouldn't believe.

01:16:54.261 --> 01:16:55.964
Who's that?
Mama.

01:16:56.024 --> 01:16:57.897
Who's that?
That's Mommy.

01:16:57.967 --> 01:16:59.600
Petunia, how'd you get
the car seat to work?

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:01.103
It was easy.

01:17:01.173 --> 01:17:03.144
This thing was stuck in the mechanism.

01:17:03.214 --> 01:17:05.549
It just about fell out in my hands.

01:17:07.021 --> 01:17:08.293
The star!

01:17:10.836 --> 01:17:12.767
Okay, Charlie!
You're on!

01:17:19.821 --> 01:17:21.924
Way to carry on the tradition, Charlie!

01:17:23.927 --> 01:17:26.702
It certainly has been a strange holiday.

01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:31.219
Actually, Mom, I think this is the
best Christmas I've ever had.

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:33.691
Thanks for saying that, Mama.

01:17:33.751 --> 01:17:36.155
I'll second that.
Best Christmas ever!

01:17:36.225 --> 01:17:37.326
Thirded!

01:17:37.397 --> 01:17:38.629
Amen, brother!
Ow!

01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:41.072
Dude, you...

01:17:42.745 --> 01:17:44.248
Hi.

01:17:44.318 --> 01:17:45.821
Dude!
Did you see that?

01:17:46.952 --> 01:17:48.295
She just winked at me!

01:17:48.355 --> 01:17:49.627
It's a Christmas miracle.

01:17:51.599 --> 01:17:52.942
Who wants pancakes?

01:17:54.344 --> 01:17:57.219
Hey, look at this!
They look like little Christmas trees.

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.251
Speaking of Christmas miracles...

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:02.194
I have another one.

01:18:02.254 --> 01:18:03.597
Oh, I have to film this.

01:18:08.074 --> 01:18:09.648
Okay, here goes.

01:18:10.448 --> 01:18:12.182
Are you ready?

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:13.484
We're having another baby!

01:18:18.672 --> 01:18:22.747
Congratulations!
Mints all around!

01:18:22.807 --> 01:18:24.849
Well, I know one thing you're good at.

01:18:24.919 --> 01:18:26.784
Making beautiful babies.

01:18:28.427 --> 01:18:29.928
I love you, too, Petunia.

01:18:31.601 --> 01:18:34.005
Well, it looks like you're
going to be a big sister, too.

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:35.477
Good luck, Charlie!

01:18:48.546 --> 01:18:50.078
Sir, you're going to
have to check this. No.

01:18:50.148 --> 01:18:52.382
No, I'm not...
Give me...

01:18:53.784 --> 01:18:55.196
Give it up, Gabe.

01:18:57.661 --> 01:19:02.609
Ladies and gentlemen, due to our aggressive
policy of overselling all flights,

01:19:02.679 --> 01:19:04.281
we are overbooked by one seat.

01:19:04.352 --> 01:19:06.025
So if anyone wants a free round trip...

01:19:06.085 --> 01:19:07.286
Right here! Whoo!

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.032
Your turn.

01:19:14.235 --> 01:19:16.178
We'll be back by New Year's.

01:19:16.248 --> 01:19:17.679
No, you won't.

01:19:24.503 --> 01:19:28.307
At what price, Teddy?
At what price?

01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:30.551
I mean, what if we...

01:19:36.299 --> 01:19:38.302
What am I doing?

01:19:39.605 --> 01:19:41.037
Cut!

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:45.755
Set and action!

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:47.928
Oh, hey. Oh, hey.

01:19:52.135 --> 01:19:53.668
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:19:54.238 --> 01:19:55.540
And yoghurt.

01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:57.782
Yoghurt isn't even on the menu.

01:19:59.585 --> 01:20:01.227
Know what I mean?

01:20:03.401 --> 01:20:05.233
I've no idea what you're talking about.

01:20:05.303 --> 01:20:06.440
I do.

01:20:06.441 --> 01:20:07.978
Bradley...

01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:10.682
And gag reel.
