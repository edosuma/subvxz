WEBVTT

00:23.607 --> 00:27.077
Antiquarische Bucher.
Felix, it's Andrea Stroh.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.780
Andrea. How are you?
Good.

00:29.947 --> 00:32.200
I assumed I'd still
find you at the shop.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.376
Look, I'm in Prague,
doing an appraisal

00:34.451 --> 00:36.954
and I've found something
that might interest you.

00:37.162 --> 00:41.417
Some kind of very old texts,
leather-bound, handwritten.

00:41.500 --> 00:45.505
I've never seen anything like them, but I
think you should come and have a look.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.636
I'd bring them to you, Felix, but
I'm afraid I might damage them.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.477
I was wondering if you could
come to Prague tomorrow?

00:52.761 --> 00:56.732
I know it's short notice, but I've got
to get this done as quickly as possible.

00:56.807 --> 01:00.653
I will meet you at 12:00. Text me
the address. I'll see you then.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.235
They didn't tell me much about
the owner, Mr. Nebojsa.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.868
Died six months ago at 96.
Lived alone for a long time.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.699
Had no will, no relatives.

01:13.782 --> 01:17.207
But the court wants everything sold
as quickly as possible for taxes.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.584
What I want you to
see is in the attic.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.880
The chest alone is at least
200 years old.

01:25.711 --> 01:26.803
Oh!

01:27.337 --> 01:30.637
Don't worry, I almost didn't look
further when I first opened it.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.937
There must be 15 of them.
Could be more.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.953
What do you think?
Did I waste your time?

01:52.988 --> 01:53.989
No.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.708
But I must take these
back to the shop.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.748
Well, of course.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.561
So, this is Nick's
new home sweet home?

02:21.850 --> 02:23.818
Wouldn't be the first place
you'd look for him.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.404
Or the last.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.820
Guess you don't have to worry about
anybody killing your neighbors here.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.494
Yeah. I don't know. I
think it's kind of homey.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.537
You know, in a, like,

02:34.613 --> 02:39.665
post-apocalyptic, neo-industrial,
steampunk chic kind of way.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.249
Hey.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.300
Pull the cars inside.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.502
I'll get the car.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.633
Hey.
Hey.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.842
Hi!

02:55.967 --> 02:58.891
So, welcome to the fome!

03:00.097 --> 03:02.270
It's a cross between a fortress
and a home.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.317
I think it's
kind of awesome.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.715
You don't have a turret, do you?
No, well, we have a roof.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.231
Gotta see that. This way,
stairs are over here.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.409
Here's a little fome-warming
gift from all of us.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.035
Thanks, you guys.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.363
And there's something
in there for Kelly.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.452
You know,
I have never met Kelly.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.787
Well, he's asleep,
but let's take a look.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.960
Not without me.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.247
- I'll open the wine.
- Oh. Please.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.837
Wow! Dude! Nice view!
Yeah, not too bad, huh?

03:32.671 --> 03:33.888
Lordy.

03:36.425 --> 03:41.147
So, how's it going between you and
Adalind, and Kelly and Eve and...

03:43.014 --> 03:44.687
Well, Adalind
has been great.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.805
Who would've thought that she
would've made such a wonderful mother?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.198
Right.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.401
How does she feel
about you?

03:54.609 --> 03:55.861
I don't know.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.077
We don't really
talk about that.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.910
Well, how do you feel
about her?

04:04.119 --> 04:05.245
I'm not sure.

04:07.456 --> 04:10.460
I mean, I'm not sure how
I'm supposed to feel.

04:13.044 --> 04:18.266
I hated her for so long, and now we're
living together and we have this kid.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.225
And it all just feels so
strangely normal.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.727
I mean, if you can
call this normal.

04:25.056 --> 04:29.482
Well, lam the wrong guy
to ask about normal.

04:29.728 --> 04:34.029
But all I can say is, it feels like
Adalind is a completely different person.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.150
You know?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.986
Yeah, like Eve.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.202
Yeah, about that,

04:41.281 --> 04:44.501
do you think she has any
idea who she used to be?

04:44.576 --> 04:45.702
I mean, Juliette?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.621
Well, she says
she remembers everything.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.674
But she talks about Juliette as if
she has nothing to do with her.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.547
So, it's like a complete
split personality.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.049
I don't think they
have a name for this.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.723
Just when you think people can't
change, right?

05:00.675 --> 05:04.555
But, dude, seriously, it is so weird
that you slept with both of them

05:04.638 --> 05:06.060
when they were each other.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.875
I mean, come on, relationships
are confusing enough as it is

05:08.892 --> 05:13.238
without getting into that kind of,
you know, bizarre arithmetic.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.785
Can I help you?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.537
Books.

05:29.496 --> 05:33.251
I'm sorry, are you relatives of Mr.
Nebojsa? No.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.253
Look, I'm here doing an appraisal
on the property, not...

05:39.589 --> 05:40.761
Where are the books?

05:41.424 --> 05:44.268
There aren't any books.
They've all been taken.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.270
Where?
Leipzig.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.937
The Antiquariat.
Now, please, let me go.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.656
That was really
uncalled for.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.835
Oh, God, Nick!

06:56.082 --> 06:58.961
Monroe,
hier spricht dein Onkel Felix.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.508
Uncle Felix.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.888
Ah!

07:05.675 --> 07:06.676
I...

07:07.427 --> 07:10.897
I'm sorry, I can't think in
German this late at night.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.770
Yeah, lam sorry
to call you this early.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.776
Oh, God, who died?
 Oh, no.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.445
Nobody died.
Oh. Good, nobody died.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.614
The reason
I call you so late,

07:20.523 --> 07:24.369
your mother told me that you
have a friend that is a Grimm.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.782
Mom told you that? That is the
reason why I'm calling you.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.330
I have something your friend
would be very interested in.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.253
I emailed you some photos.
This cannot wait.

07:34.329 --> 07:38.004
Do not forward these photos, and
delete them when you are done.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.384
Hello?
What was that all about?

07:43.546 --> 07:44.638
Uh...

07:46.383 --> 07:50.229
It's my Uncle Felix, he owns an
antiquarian bookstore in Leipzig.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.308
So, what, he wants to sell you
books at 3:00 in the morning?

07:54.933 --> 07:56.810
No, he said he sent me
some pictures

07:56.893 --> 08:01.490
that my friend, the Grimm,
might be interested in.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.279
He knows about Nick? Apparently,
my mother told him.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.080
Oh!

08:09.656 --> 08:11.624
Great.
I know.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.708
What are these pictures? I don't know.
Let's go back to bed.

08:15.787 --> 08:19.257
No, I'm wide awake now, we're
looking at these pictures.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.251
Okay.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.755
All right.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.227
Holy crap.

08:31.970 --> 08:35.270
That looks like
it's from a Grimm book.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.774
Where did he get this stuff?
You got to call Nick.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.741
I found it!

08:46.443 --> 08:47.820
It was in the attic.

08:48.570 --> 08:52.245
I haven't looked at this stuff
in such a long time.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.996
Here it is.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.787
Deutschland, 1980 to 1990.

08:58.371 --> 09:02.217
Uncle Felix was born
in Freiburg, 1949.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.387
I'm telling you, when it comes
to the printed page before 1900,

09:05.462 --> 09:07.305
he's an aficionado supreme.

09:07.797 --> 09:11.427
In fact, most of the books and maps I
have in my collection came from him.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.977
That's him.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.723
He never married
or had children.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.087
He was always more interested
in books than anything else.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.483
Honestly,
if I hadn't met you,

09:22.812 --> 09:24.985
I probably would've ended up the
same way except with clocks.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.948
Then it's a good thing you met me.
This is true.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.201
Hey, I'm really glad you came right
over, this is some amazing stuff.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.454
This is Uncle Felix,
the guy who called.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.913
He's Blutbaden?
Yep.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.966
But more of a Bookbaden.
Not really a physical guy.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.209
What did he send?

09:44.542 --> 09:47.466
That's on the computer.
Follow me.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.639
He said he was
doing an appraisal.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.560
Uncle Felix is called on a lot to, like,
appraise old books or book collections.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.933
He works for museums and
collectors all over Europe,

09:56.012 --> 09:57.980
and I got to tell ya,
these books look really old.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.476
Some of these Wesen, I don't think
I've ever even heard of them.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.601
Me, either.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.686
He knew what the books were?
He did.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.361
Look, he's a smart
book dealer.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.694
He knows the value of these books is
obviously gonna be different for a Grimm

10:10.777 --> 10:13.657
than it'll be for someone who thinks
they're just, you know, fairy tales.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.864
Did your uncle
know a Grimm?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.031
Not that I know of.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.667
But look, having a
relationship with a Grimm

10:17.742 --> 10:19.942
is not exactly something you
wanna talk about in public,

10:19.994 --> 10:21.837
especially not in
the old country.

10:21.913 --> 10:22.914
Do you trust him?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.383
You mean, do I think this stuff is real?
Hell, yeah, it's real.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.252
Uncle Felix wouldn't touch
a forgery.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.549
Did he say
how much he wants?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.634
No. I think he wants to find out
if you're interested first.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.592
Look, I'm not trying to pressure you, I'm
just saying this stuff looks amazing.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.102
Especially after all you lost
when the trailer was burned.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.561
Exactly.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.894
So, if you're
interested...

10:39.973 --> 10:41.771
I'm interested.

10:48.857 --> 10:49.904
Hey.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.915
Antiquarische Bucher.
Uncle Felix?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.416
No. He's not here.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.832
Oh. Well, who's this?

11:02.036 --> 11:05.085
I work here. Who's calling? I can
give him your name and number.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.210
No. That's okay. He's got it.
Just tell him Monroe called.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.804
Yes, Monroe called. Gut.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.027
Two of these people
are still out there.

11:28.146 --> 11:31.992
You know, this Black Claw is getting to
be a real dangerous pain in the ass.

11:32.066 --> 11:35.115
We can't go to the FBI,
NSA, or the DA.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.909
At least HW knows
what's going on.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.828
How much do you think
a Grimm book is worth?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.127
You need some money?

11:49.959 --> 11:53.133
Monroe got a call last night from
his uncle in Leipzig, Germany.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.632
He's a book dealer and apparently,
he found some Grimm books,

11:55.715 --> 11:59.686
and he called Monroe at 3:30 in the
morning to see if I wanted to buy them.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.640
I got some photos,
they do look really old.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.405
How in the hell did a book dealer
from Leipzig know what you were?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.647
Monroe's mother
mentioned me.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.820
So much for
confidentiality.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.983
Whatever price this guy
wants for those books,

12:13.066 --> 12:15.034
make sure he didn't
kill a Grimm to get 'em.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.012
Yes?

12:48.393 --> 12:50.987
It's time to set
a couple of things straight.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.565
What?

12:54.857 --> 12:57.952
That last night at Nick's house,
I wasn't trying to kill you.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.074
You know that.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.241
You're talking about Juliette.
Yeah.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.291
I know you weren't
trying to kill her.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.086
No, I wasn't,
but I would have.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.336
She was trying to kill Nick.
I would expect that from you.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.716
Yeah, I need to know how you feel
about Nick and Adalind and their kid.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.552
Juliette is dead.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.469
I know she's dead.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.726
I'm asking you if
you'd ever hurt 'em.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.813
I wouldn't. I don't
owe Juliette anything.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.903
But I do.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.113
Okay? She helped me.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.531
She would've
killed you, too.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.241
Glad we talked.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.255
Polls have got us
in a dead heat.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.510
If the election were held
tomorrow, it could go either way.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.182
We've taken the high road
and Gallagher hasn't.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.134
We have to stop
being the nice guy.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.178
I'm not trying
to be a nice guy.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.140
I just don't want this campaign
to be like every other campaign.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.851
I don't wanna get elected because
I'm the guy they hate the least.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.106
Pointing out
a couple of flaws

14:13.186 --> 14:15.234
about your opponent does not
make you the bad guy.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.074
If you wrestle a pig... You get
dirty and the pig likes it.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.709
But George Bernard Shaw is not
running for the Mayor of Portland.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.495
And you don't
wrestle a pig.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.415
You take 'em to slaughter,
and you make bacon.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.584
How do you suggest we make
bacon out of Gallagher?

14:28.785 --> 14:33.006
Well, first you fatten him up
with some youthful indiscretions,

14:33.081 --> 14:36.676
and then you slit his throat with a
couple of covered-up drug charges.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.297
And finally, you gut him
with gambling debts

14:40.380 --> 14:43.179
and some favors paid out to
known associates of the mob.

14:45.927 --> 14:46.974
Is any of that true?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.479
All Of it.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.479
It was discovered
during undercover operations

14:50.556 --> 14:53.309
and then later,
buried with political favor.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.696
Look, whether it's true or not,
I still don't like using it.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.408
The public has a right to
know who they're gonna elect.

15:00.483 --> 15:04.738
And it wouldn't come from us.
That's what the press is for.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.245
I mean, if he called us
at 3:00 in the morning,

15:09.325 --> 15:10.702
he must've thought
it was urgent.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.958
So, why hasn't he
called you back?

15:13.037 --> 15:16.007
I don't know, maybe he realized
the books were fakes, or something.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.379
But wouldn't he have called
to tell you that?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.007
He could've found
another buyer.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.215
Well, that would be a shame,
maybe you should try calling him again.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.299
He's probably just trying to
establish how much they're worth.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.977
You know? So, he has an idea
of how much to charge.

15:31.389 --> 15:32.686
I got it.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.442
Oh, my God, Uncle Felix.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.657
Why didn't you tell
me you were coming?

15:41.732 --> 15:44.827
There's no time. You must contact
your friend tonight, now!

15:44.902 --> 15:46.028
Hello.
Ah!

15:46.696 --> 15:49.370
You are Rosalee.
Lam very nice to meet you.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.209
This is my Uncle Felix.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.170
I had to leave
Leipzig in a hurry.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.920
Welcome to our home. Can I get
you something to eat or...

15:58.082 --> 16:00.210
No, no,
thank you very much.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.300
You have to call your friend, right now.
This cannot wait.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.756
Okay, okay.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.553
You okay? You seem
kind of quiet tonight.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.937
Today would've been
my mother's birthday.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.350
Ah.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.564
It's just hard not to think about it
when you try not to think about it,

16:20.646 --> 16:22.286
because then all you do
is think about it.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.946
It's okay, it'll be
over tomorrow. Sorry.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.577
No, it's okay.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.370
Here I am, thinking about my mother,
who threw me out of the house,

16:31.449 --> 16:34.999
and I don't even know your
birthday, and you don't know mine.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.834
Yeah. April 14th.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.792
You know my birthday?
Yeah. Well, you know.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.920
I guess you did
arrest me once.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.639
Mine is June 18th
just so you know.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.383
Monroe.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.767
Nick, my uncle's here.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.478
From Leipzig?
Yep.

16:52.553 --> 16:56.228
Showed up unannounced and he says he really
needs to talk to you, like, right now.

16:56.307 --> 16:59.277
Yeah, I have traveled a great
distance, this cannot wait.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.104
We must meet
with you tonight.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.821
So...

17:04.232 --> 17:06.484
Tell him
I brought this.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.781
Oh, my.

17:09.153 --> 17:13.078
Nick, he brought one of these books, I'm
sorry, I think you really need to see this.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.534
Okay. I'm on my way.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.580
If Black Claw marks their
killing of an antiques dealer...

17:20.665 --> 17:22.945
They were looking for
something and didn't get it.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.044
It's a warning
to whoever has it.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.802
It says she was found in the house of Joseph
Nebojsa, who died several months ago.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.558
Do we know who
Joseph Nebojsa is?

17:30.758 --> 17:32.977
No, but we're going
to find out.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.230
It's Nick.
Take it.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.145
Nick.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.856
I'm on my way to
Monroe's house.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.408
His uncle's a book dealer, and he's
got some books that may be Grimm.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.826
I'm not sure if
I trust this guy.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.661
Want some back up?
Yeah.

17:50.820 --> 17:51.821
Coming your way.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.333
Do you know how old
this book is?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.287
Oh, yeah. It was
manufactured in Nuremberg

17:59.370 --> 18:03.500
sometime between 1390, 1395
in the Ulrich Stromer mill.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.962
Stromer was a councilor
in Nuremberg,

18:07.044 --> 18:10.173
which was a free Imperial city
of the Holy Roman Empire.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.430
His paper mill was the first
permanent one north of the Alpen.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.228
And he died of
the plague in 1407.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.899
Yeah, he's definitely your uncle.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.142
Excuse me.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.114
Hi.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.365
Wait a minute,
who is she?

18:35.448 --> 18:38.292
Uncle Felix, these are my
friends, Nick and Trubel...

18:38.367 --> 18:40.210
Theresa.
Theresa.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.998
Why is she here?
She's like me.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.504
Both of you?

18:48.210 --> 18:50.053
Two Grimms!

18:50.379 --> 18:52.019
- No! Wait! Stop!
- No! Stop!

18:56.344 --> 18:57.516
No! Stop!

18:57.595 --> 18:58.596
No! Stop!

18:59.013 --> 19:01.607
Everybody, calm down!
Don't do this!

19:01.766 --> 19:03.564
They are my friends,
okay?

19:03.893 --> 19:05.941
He is my uncle!
Okay?

19:06.020 --> 19:07.738
So, everybody,
just settle down!

19:07.897 --> 19:09.649
We're all friends here!

19:14.987 --> 19:15.988
Sorry.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.958
Yeah. Me, too.

19:20.743 --> 19:21.835
Okay.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.215
So, where's this book?
It is over here.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.214
Ah! But do not touch it with
your fingers, it is too old.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.308
Careful.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.596
Huh.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.895
Is it real?
Yeah, it looks like, yeah.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.780
I would not come all
this way to trick you.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.897
You have more?
There are 20.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.323
Twenty Grimm books?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.783
- Yeah.
- Where?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.531
I brought them with me.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.502
This definitely
belonged to a Grimm.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.289
Ah. I believe it did.
How did you get it?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.875
Did you kill him?
Oh. No, no, no.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.632
No. lam not violent,
despite what just happened.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.339
No, these books belonged
to Joseph Nebojsa.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.640
He lived in Prague.
He was very old.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.926
He died
of natural causes.

20:19.593 --> 20:23.314
I was brought in to assess the books
by an antiques dealer friend of mine.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.816
They were hidden in
the attic of the house.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.565
Then Joseph must have been a Grimm.
Or a relative of one.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.329
I mean, he could have inherited
them, had no idea what they were.

20:31.397 --> 20:35.402
However he got them is not important.
The fact that they exist is a miracle.

20:36.819 --> 20:40.790
I should have destroyed them, probably,
but I can't. They're too rare.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.033
It would be like destroying
the Magna Carta

20:43.117 --> 20:46.166
or the original pages of
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.915
I devoted my whole life
to the written word.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.877
I cannot be the one to erase
any of them from the world.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.634
I've spent my entire life defending
the imagination, the thoughts

20:55.713 --> 20:59.263
and the passions of a writer who would
commit these words to the page.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.192
I am sorry.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.524
I get carried away.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.965
How much do you want
for the books?

21:15.441 --> 21:18.194
Well, handling such material
is very dangerous,

21:18.277 --> 21:20.700
but in spite of that,
as they are priceless,

21:20.821 --> 21:23.825
I will let you have
them for $100,000.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.951
$100,000?
Are you kidding me?

21:26.076 --> 21:28.499
My antiques dealer friend
has already been killed.

21:28.579 --> 21:31.128
And whoever did it must know
that I have these books.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.380
Here, you may keep
the book I brought.

21:34.043 --> 21:37.092
I will contact you in 24
hours for your decision.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.139
Uncle Felix,
that's a lot of money!

21:39.256 --> 21:41.304
It is the best I can do.

21:49.266 --> 21:53.112
There is no way I can pull
together $100,000 in 24 hours.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.064
But if all the books
look like this one...

21:55.189 --> 21:57.157
And what if
they're destroyed?

21:57.233 --> 22:00.828
Which is what will happen if they
fall into certain Wesen hands.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.373
I've heard of the guy that your uncle
got the books from, Joseph Nebojsa.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.450
H ow?

22:06.534 --> 22:08.878
There's a Black Claw
on the wall of his house.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.713
That's where they killed
the antiques dealer.

22:13.916 --> 22:17.341
HW gets alerted whenever that mark
is found anywhere in the world.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.089
HW's gotta be funded
by the government, right?

22:20.589 --> 22:22.509
Yeah. Well, maybe they can
come up with the cash.

22:22.550 --> 22:25.099
I mean, these books would mean
something to them, too, wouldn't they?

22:25.261 --> 22:26.261
Yeah, maybe.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.305
We should talk to Meisner
and show him the book.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.599
It's worth a shot.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.235
I'll see what I can find
out about Joseph Nebojsa.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.652
Right on.

22:40.776 --> 22:41.868
Wow.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.626
This is a little intense, a little
intimidating, little bit of both.

22:54.164 --> 22:57.634
So, Meisner,
this is Monroe.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.258
Good to finally meet you.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.807
And I think you
sort of know...

23:07.887 --> 23:08.979
Eve.

23:10.931 --> 23:11.978
Monroe.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.268
Well...

23:14.643 --> 23:19.319
You're looking very, um, good for someone
we all thought was dead and gone.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.295
Not that coming back from it is
a bad thing.

23:23.986 --> 23:27.707
I guess I actually owe you
a thanks for...

23:27.823 --> 23:31.248
No. You don't.
Is that the book?

23:31.452 --> 23:32.829
Yeah.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.926
Do you know about the Grimm books?
Yeah. I've seen a few.

23:39.043 --> 23:42.843
Well, this one is pretty amazing,
even as far as Grimm books go.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.562
If there are 19
more like this,

23:50.638 --> 23:53.358
it would help replace what was lost
when the trailer was burned down.

23:56.852 --> 23:57.944
Yeah.

23:58.854 --> 24:02.529
A lot of irreplaceable history was
destroyed, and not by accident.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.462
If Black Claw is willing
to kill to get to these books,

24:05.569 --> 24:07.071
they must consider
them dangerous.

24:07.446 --> 24:11.826
One of Black Claw's missions is to eradicate
all things Grimm, including Grimms.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.462
Look, can you get us the $100,000
that Monroe's uncle wants?

24:15.871 --> 24:17.373
We only have 24 hours.

24:17.915 --> 24:21.545
Actually, make that 22-and-a-half.
And my uncle will not hang around.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.174
I'll see what I can do.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.807
But this is government money
from a fund that doesn't exist,

24:26.882 --> 24:29.180
so, I can't make
any promises.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.026
Huh.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.489
This is Felix Dietrich.
I received your text.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.289
I have the number.

24:57.287 --> 25:01.417
"A-O-7-7-2-B-R-5-5-2-4."

25:02.835 --> 25:04.553
Where do I pick it up?

25:15.097 --> 25:18.226
After 4:00.
Yeah, okay, thank you.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.318
I mean, it was really weird.

25:24.732 --> 25:30.956
She looks like Juliette, but I have no idea
if there's anything of her left in her.

25:31.572 --> 25:32.572
But she remembered you?

25:32.614 --> 25:34.161
Oh. Yeah, no,
she remembers everything,

25:34.241 --> 25:37.245
except there's a complete
disconnect with her own past,

25:37.327 --> 25:40.126
mighty convenient considering
how much guilt should be

25:40.205 --> 25:41.957
eating away
at her conscience.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.633
You think
she even has one?

25:43.751 --> 25:44.798
Not from what I got.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.804
Yes!

25:50.090 --> 25:52.138
This is what
I was looking for.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.137
Oh, my God,
that's the guy.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.023
Monroe.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.904
Hey, Nick, have you heard
anything from Meisner?

26:07.983 --> 26:10.361
No, not yet. 'Cause we're
down to, like, 10 hours.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.444
I know.

26:11.487 --> 26:15.242
Anyways, Rosalee found out some incredible
stuff about this Joseph Nebojsa.

26:15.324 --> 26:19.670
I was able to trace his lineage. Nick,
his ancestors go back to the Crusades.

26:19.995 --> 26:23.249
If I'm right, one of his relatives
on his father's side was a knight

26:23.499 --> 26:27.470
that fought for the Knights Templar
in the sack of Constantinople.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.922
And he was from Zollern,
a town in the Black Forest.

26:30.005 --> 26:33.384
Nick, I think this Nebojsa
is really rooted, okay?

26:33.467 --> 26:35.469
We cannot let
these books get away.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.563
I mean, the history of
them alone is worth a lot.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.266
Well, I don't
have $100,000.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.524
Neither do we,
but we were thinking,

26:41.600 --> 26:45.230
maybe we could all come up with enough
to make Monroe's uncle make us a deal.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.564
Okay, maybe.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.611
We got a body downtown.
I gotta go.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.951
Dude, think about it,
though, okay?

26:51.360 --> 26:55.081
I mean, I can stall for time as long
as he thinks we're getting the money.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.577
Yeah, try it.

26:57.032 --> 27:00.878
Victim is mid-60s, attacked inside his
hotel room sometime earlier this morning.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.253
This one's a little unusual, even
considering the normal unusual.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.922
Why? Victim's mouth
has a lot of blood.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.716
Was he hit? No, looks more
like he bit somebody.

27:09.878 --> 27:10.925
Very hard.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.052
Looks like somebody
was looking for something.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.394
Got a possible ID,
victim's registered as...

27:17.469 --> 27:18.470
Felix.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.140
- Yeah, how'd you know that?
- That's Monroe's uncle.

27:21.598 --> 27:24.522
This is the book guy?
Yeah.

27:24.685 --> 27:27.529
That must have been
what they were after.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.035
"In 1203, after the Siege
of Constantinople,

27:33.110 --> 27:39.493
"Alexios Angelos was crowned Emperor
Alexios IV of the Byzantine Empire.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.666
"He was pro-Crusader
and tried to pacify the city,

27:43.745 --> 27:47.841
"but riots broke out
between the Greeks,

27:47.916 --> 27:50.544
"who hated the Crusaders, and
Latins, who supported them.

27:50.627 --> 27:54.473
"During that time, much of the populace
began to turn against the Emperor,

27:54.548 --> 27:56.926
"finally deposing him
and imprisoning him.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.020
"Then, in March, the Crusader
and Venetian leadership

28:00.095 --> 28:02.268
"decided to take
the whole city,

28:02.347 --> 28:04.896
"dividing the Byzantine Empire
between them."

28:05.392 --> 28:07.440
Sounds a lot like
what's happening now.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.237
Only the names change.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.068
Nick, did you hear
from Meisner?

28:14.276 --> 28:15.323
No.

28:15.569 --> 28:18.243
Monroe, I have
some bad news.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.582
What? We have to come up
with the money.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.038
No, it's not that.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.834
Look, your uncle Felix
has been murdered.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.214
What?
Oh, my God!

28:28.290 --> 28:29.667
I'm at
the crime scene now.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.177
And I think I need
your help on this one.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.379
You need
to come down here.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.591
It looks Wesen on Wesen,
but it's pretty brutal.

28:36.757 --> 28:37.804
Um...

28:38.467 --> 28:39.684
Yeah, just
tell me where.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.304
The Grand Regent Hotel.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.390
I know it.

28:45.307 --> 28:48.402
Oh, my God, honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.862
I can't believe this.

28:55.651 --> 28:58.370
I guess 24 hours was
more time than he had.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.500
I'm gonna have
to call my mom and...

29:05.827 --> 29:07.454
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.299
I'm just sorry it had
to turn out this way.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.501
Yeah.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.509
So, I guess whoever did
this got the books, too.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.052
I'm not so sure.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.092
We talked
to the manager.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.428
Your uncle didn't have a
rental car, he arrived by cab.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.596
Okay, but what does that
have to do with the books?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.933
Each one of those books
weighs nearly five pounds.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.959
You just don't cart around 100
pounds of books on your back.

29:29.977 --> 29:32.196
Your uncle may never have
had the books in this room.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.368
Well, whoever killed him,
he fought back, right?

29:38.443 --> 29:40.662
That's right, yeah. It looks like
he put up a hell of a fight.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.863
Yeah.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.457
Uncle Felix,
he got a piece of him.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.214
Which means
the guy is wounded.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.212
Right?

29:53.542 --> 29:55.622
I mean, he didn't walk out
of here like he walked in.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.129
Oh. He didn't walk out.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.632
He went out the window.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.431
Yep.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.013
We'll get
some good prints.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.602
We gotta find
this bastard.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.539
- Hello.
- Felix?

30:41.506 --> 30:42.678
Uh...

30:54.102 --> 30:55.319
What'd he say?

30:56.480 --> 30:59.859
He said he went to Felix's shop,
and it was, like, trashed,

30:59.941 --> 31:01.534
like somebody broke in.

31:01.610 --> 31:05.285
Find every phone call made and received
from this phone in the last 72 hours.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.456
Yep.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.639
Not getting any hits on the prints.
I'm gonna check Interpol.

31:26.802 --> 31:29.476
We have three different blood
types in the hotel room.

31:29.596 --> 31:32.645
So, there was more than one attacker?
Yeah, at least two.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.738
Having a little trouble
with Felix's phone.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.487
It got damaged, I'm
assuming during the fight.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.235
I pulled the SIM card,
it's being checked.

31:39.648 --> 31:42.848
Your uncle said the antiques dealer was
killed in the house where the books were.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.362
I think so, yeah. Well,
what if it's the same guys?

31:45.529 --> 31:47.623
They could have easily found
out your uncle got the books

31:47.697 --> 31:49.177
from the dealer
and followed him here.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.076
You know, I called my uncle
at his book shop

31:51.159 --> 31:53.082
and it was late,
but he always works late,

31:53.161 --> 31:54.629
and somebody else
answered the phone.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.295
You tell them anything?
Just my name.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.633
Oh, God. You don't think they could find
him because I made that phone call?

32:01.711 --> 32:04.339
Don't go there. They could've gotten a
lot of information about your uncle.

32:04.464 --> 32:07.343
If these guys are Black Claw, maybe
HW has got something on them.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.933
Well, your uncle
bloodied them up,

32:11.012 --> 32:13.640
so, one or both of them could be
needing a little medical help.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.435
All right. Wu and I
will check hospitals.

32:16.518 --> 32:17.815
Let's go.

32:22.149 --> 32:23.617
Sir, we're gonna have to
put you in the ambulance.

32:23.692 --> 32:26.445
No, no. My friend is worse.
You must stop the bleeding.

32:26.528 --> 32:27.950
There's another one!

32:32.534 --> 32:34.582
What happened? Were
you attacked by dogs?

32:35.412 --> 32:36.459
Yes.

32:36.538 --> 32:39.542
All right. I gotta call animal control
and report this to the police.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.964
What kind of dogs were they?
I don't know.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.557
What did they look like?
Like this.

32:54.556 --> 32:57.355
- What is this, a Wesen database?
- You're in it.

32:57.434 --> 33:00.187
Krisztian Ajandok and Oscar
Vasicek are both Anubi,

33:00.270 --> 33:03.023
and we've tracked a connection to a
Black Claw cell in the Czech Republic.

33:03.106 --> 33:06.656
HW in Berlin already connected them to the
killing of the antiques dealer in Prague.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.990
And now they're here.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.496
See if you can find
when they arrived.

33:14.576 --> 33:15.577
Hank.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.875
Two paramedics were
killed an hour ago.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.673
Looks an awful lot like what
happened to Monroe's uncle.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.717
And the 911 caller
spoke with an accent.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.545
Now we have an ID
on both them.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.548
Krisztian Ajandok
and Oscar Vasicek.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.383
HW had that?
Yeah.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.389
Wish we had that database.

33:31.593 --> 33:33.095
You got this one?
Yeah.

33:33.762 --> 33:34.934
You work that side.

33:37.557 --> 33:38.604
I got 'em.

33:38.975 --> 33:41.819
Time stamp on this is
11:38 last night at PDX.

33:42.145 --> 33:44.773
See if they rented a car
or booked a flight out.

33:44.898 --> 33:47.742
That will tell us if
they're still in Portland.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.449
Wu.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.251
So, I finished going
over the SIM card data

33:56.326 --> 33:58.545
on Felix's phone
for the last 72 hours.

33:58.620 --> 34:02.124
Nothing unusual, except for
the last incoming call.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.880
Who was it? Not a "who,"
it's from a cargo company.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.550
I called and found out Felix
is expecting a shipment

34:07.629 --> 34:09.802
to arrive sometime this
afternoon or tonight.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.632
Without a shipping number,
they can't tell me any more.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.178
All right, where's it coming in?
Airport cargo facility.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.473
They closed about half an hour ago.
Won't be open till 9:00 in the morning.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.811
Thanks.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.859
Your uncle had
the books shipped.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.277
That's why he gave you
24 hours to think about it.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.237
Well, we couldn't find a shipping
order in the hotel room,

34:25.313 --> 34:27.433
and Felix would have needed
that to pick up the books.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.949
These guys
must have taken it.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.242
Got something
on the car.

34:30.443 --> 34:35.244
Ford Expedition, rented in the name of
Krisztian Ajandok, hasn't been returned.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.295
Then they're on their
way to get the books.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.996
The cargo company doesn't open
up till 9:00 tomorrow morning,

34:41.079 --> 34:43.172
but they're not
gonna wait for that.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.340
Thanks for your help.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.592
I'll be asking you
for yours soon enough.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.261
I'm going, too.
No.

34:48.335 --> 34:51.306
We're not going to risk you
over these books.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.983
That's their rental car.
Good.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.063
Then they're still here.

35:28.877 --> 35:31.130
Looks like they
killed the security guard.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.078
You killed my uncle.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.258
You shouldn't
have done that.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.468
My uncle was a good man.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.430
We need to get this
trunk out of here.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.819
Okay, that should do it.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.668
Let's get them out of there.
Gently, gently.

37:56.858 --> 37:59.907
There's a lot more stuff
in here than just books.

38:06.117 --> 38:10.338
Oh. That's incredible.
That is a lot of stuff.

38:10.413 --> 38:13.132
Looks like we got
our trailer back.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.561
Something
about this lock.

38:31.184 --> 38:32.902
It's bigger than
it needs to be.

38:33.228 --> 38:36.482
I still don't understand why they
would kill people for all this.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.068
Its only real value
is to a Grimm.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.995
Black Claw is trying to destroy
everything that has to do with Grimms.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.539
Hey, hey, wait, wait a
minute, look at this one.

38:44.614 --> 38:45.615
It's not like
the others.

38:45.698 --> 38:49.828
It like some kind of family
tree book of ancestry.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.374
That's not a regular
family tree.

38:54.457 --> 38:58.633
It's only following a few individuals
from generation to generation.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.755
And some of them
just dead end.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.841
What's the name of the guy
your uncle got the books from?

39:03.007 --> 39:04.554
Uh, Joseph Nebojsa.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.308
It's the same last name.
Go to the end.

39:12.684 --> 39:13.901
There he is,
Joseph Nebojsa.

39:13.977 --> 39:17.197
Oh, my God,
they're all Grimms.

39:17.272 --> 39:21.448
That's why this is worth killing for.
Everyone in this book is a Grimm.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.153
See if Burkhardt's
in there.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.663
No, it would be my mother's
maiden name, Kessler.

39:25.738 --> 39:29.788
Hey, I think
I just saw a Kessler.

39:33.121 --> 39:34.418
Here.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.052
Was Walter your grandfather?
Yeah.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.339
And there's Aunt Marie,
there's my mom,

39:44.924 --> 39:45.971
and there I am.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.809
But if you're in here,
maybe I am, too.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.392
Nebojsa was keeping
this book up to date.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.068
This would be real dangerous if
it fell into the wrong hands.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.827
We got ourselves
a secret compartment.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.919
It's probably just
an extra trunk key.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.598
Nick.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.135
You gotta see this.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.522
Oh, my God,
another key?

40:45.944 --> 40:47.196
Three of them.

40:51.491 --> 40:53.051
Go get the other two
keys from upstairs.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.036
I'll bring those.
Yeah.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.943
Doesn't all fit together. Yeah,
we're still missing two keys.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.025
But maybe we have enough
to figure out where it is.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.029
Wait a minute.
Look at this.

41:30.113 --> 41:33.117
These three hills here, with
the two rivers on either side,

41:33.199 --> 41:35.042
connecting to
the bigger river here,

41:35.118 --> 41:37.746
that is an exact match for
what the keys are saying.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.083
And it's in the Schwarzwald.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.093
The Black Forest?
Yeah.

41:44.377 --> 41:48.473
I mean, I know these maps aren't as accurate
as, like, modern day topographical maps,

41:48.548 --> 41:53.304
but this terrain is a pretty
good match for this terrain,

41:53.386 --> 41:55.764
Which is outside
of Wolfach,

41:55.888 --> 41:58.232
which is right here.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.317
So, we can figure out where they
buried whatever it is they buried.

42:03.104 --> 42:04.321
Exactly.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.526
Well, not exactly, unless you had
the classic X marks the spot.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.494
But, dude, we've got it.

42:11.779 --> 42:14.407
And it's right here
in the Black Forest.

42:15.742 --> 42:18.291
We're going to
the Black Forest.
