WEBVTT

00:02.779 --> 00:05.809
what's so important that we have to use
encrypted line

00:06.410 --> 00:11.179
we've confirmed that an eco-terrorist
cocaine green scorpion is targeting your

00:11.179 --> 00:13.160
zone specifically on Lou

00:13.160 --> 00:16.789
and just what I don't need what's the
size of the cell

00:17.300 --> 00:18.420
unknown

00:18.420 --> 00:22.410
that makes the orbit unknown specific
targets

00:23.109 --> 00:25.179
one known

00:25.179 --> 00:26.910
you don't know much do you

00:26.910 --> 00:30.000
why are you taking this random threat so
seriously

00:30.000 --> 00:34.710
terrorist leader zach mark former Navy
SEALs sack partner

00:35.240 --> 00:39.469
affirmative it's not good when a Navy
SEAL decides to blow up the world

00:39.469 --> 00:42.469
because he knows the wick

00:45.189 --> 00:48.759

the ocean floor is littered with rusting
ships unexploded bombs

02:38.770 --> 02:42.820

06:55.949 --> 06:56.819
you

06:56.819 --> 07:01.528

not a terrorist

07:29.699 --> 07:33.180
excellent and prove me wrong

07:33.180 --> 07:38.519
you may trust you get close to him is
the operating alone or is in contact

07:38.519 --> 07:40.709
with other cells once you know

07:40.709 --> 07:45.810
disengage with me I know my limitations

you can and you never knew how to follow

08:18.120 --> 08:21.120

Mitch I was a Navy Seal and we served a
decade apart but everything stays the

19:10.799 --> 19:14.430
same the buzzwords shorthand everything
but the man on the fine

19:14.430 --> 19:17.789
that's right from what I heard it sounds
like mitch is involved in some sort of

19:17.789 --> 19:20.519
covert ops mission of it like sacred

19:20.519 --> 19:25.619
we call them black ops wow what kind of
thing we don't opportunities are

19:25.619 --> 19:31.500
limitless dangerous could be here in
Hawaii and what could be dangerous

19:31.500 --> 19:36.089
it's not like we're at war look it's a
safe place to me if a terrorist group

19:36.089 --> 19:40.289
from Sudan wants to buy red mercury from
korean arms deals

19:40.289 --> 19:44.759
what would they do with red mercury it
wrap it with explosives and detonated in

19:44.759 --> 19:47.759
a populated area

19:49.099 --> 19:51.039
so you think mr. trouble

19:51.039 --> 19:54.159
his control think so we have to help
them

19:54.160 --> 19:58.000
but in order to do that we have to know
what his mission is he's been out of the

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
seals for 15 years why would they bring
him back

20:05.809 --> 20:08.809

kind of 60

29:57.170 --> 30:01.670
and once a charmer always a charmer the
years kind of taking that out of it and

30:01.670 --> 30:05.870
when you get down out of the water flows
and bubbles with her senior swimming

30:05.869 --> 30:08.869
around that new wetsuit

30:12.179 --> 30:15.179

yeah

30:34.730 --> 30:39.289
careful isn't it

30:39.289 --> 30:44.029
two things coexist

30:44.630 --> 30:48.140
weapons of destruction the birthplace of
life I mean it's amazing isn't it

30:48.829 --> 30:51.829
you know you see something long enough
you think it belongs here

30:52.579 --> 30:55.579
you become so accepting

30:56.359 --> 31:01.099
but this felt corruption pollution
mutating all the life around the sea

31:02.299 --> 31:05.480
life changes part of evolution

31:05.480 --> 31:09.829
this is a part of the evolution of life
fiscal is unnatural

31:10.609 --> 31:13.609
it's evil

31:24.329 --> 31:29.038
you know I just really wanted to see the
look on your face

31:29.669 --> 31:34.230
tiny is astonishing isn't armaments that
I belt to destroy life and now I

31:34.230 --> 31:36.538
sanctuary giving birth life

31:36.538 --> 31:39.658
you can see it's such a wonderful simple
thing

31:40.200 --> 31:43.440
nature is and that even seem too
complicated

31:44.099 --> 31:48.750
you got that right if man was it so
egocentric and sell fishing

31:48.750 --> 31:53.640
irresponsible at I am Telling You Mitch
if we could just get the world leaders

31:53.640 --> 31:57.419
to realize what they are doing then all
the pollution of the Earth's waters can

31:57.419 --> 32:00.419
be stopped before it is too late

32:01.679 --> 32:07.080
don't worry about zag he left underwater
photography thing is really getting into

32:07.079 --> 32:07.980
it

32:07.980 --> 32:11.069
Mitch it um it really is that simple

32:11.759 --> 32:16.980
all we need is some publicity for
Shelton he is a product of publicity

32:16.980 --> 32:21.750
you remember him with the tanks you get
ron reagan and even Clinton TV have the

32:21.750 --> 32:25.319
right kind of publicity we can achieve
almost anything you have a breed

32:25.319 --> 32:29.849
accomplish that you can organization one
person can make any of that happen

32:29.849 --> 32:33.990
absolutely precisely organization yes
that is mandatory

32:34.679 --> 32:37.679
but what is more important is shocked

32:40.930 --> 32:46.509
shock impact something that is so
horrifying that the world has nothing to

32:46.509 --> 32:50.079
do but to look and to listen and to hear
the message

32:53.380 --> 32:56.380
sorry gotta change no ring

32:59.849 --> 33:02.969
