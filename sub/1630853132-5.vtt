Previously on
The Girl from Plainville <i>...</i>

00:04.050 --> 00:05.177
Katie Rayburn--she's tough,

00:05.177 --> 00:06.680
and she's not
gonna bring charges

00:06.680 --> 00:08.183
unless she's got something
solid enough for an indictment.

00:08.183 --> 00:09.352
- So, if she's convicted,

00:09.352 --> 00:10.730
what kind of a sentence
is she facing?

00:10.730 --> 00:12.233
- Up to 20 years.

00:12.233 --> 00:13.569
On the boat,
<i>it never felt</i>

00:13.569 --> 00:15.447
<i>like you didn't know</i>
<i>what was coming.</i>

00:15.447 --> 00:18.538
<i>There was order, calm.</i>

00:18.538 --> 00:22.461
- Susie?
Enough.

00:22.461 --> 00:25.092
She doesn't want me
<i>talking to you anymore.</i>

00:25.092 --> 00:26.637
She thinks you're
obsessed with me.

00:26.637 --> 00:27.889
- I'm not.

00:27.889 --> 00:29.433
- I'm not into girls, Michelle.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.479
I'm not into you.

00:31.479 --> 00:35.028
- 2014, Conrad Junior's son got
into a physical altercation.

00:35.028 --> 00:38.243
- If I'm Cataldo, I just
figured out Conrad's motive

00:38.243 --> 00:41.332
for killing himself,
and it is not Michelle Carter.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.877
The jury can't see this.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.883
- When you were on the phone
with Conrad

00:45.883 --> 00:49.641
<i>the night of his death,</i>

00:49.641 --> 00:54.150
did you--did you tell him
to get back in the truck?

02:22.075 --> 02:23.119
More.

02:30.510 --> 02:31.720
More.

02:49.296 --> 02:51.927
What would you do
with those fingers?

03:08.544 --> 03:10.171
You're beautiful.

03:16.142 --> 03:18.396
- How would you touch me?

03:21.737 --> 03:25.368
Like this?

03:25.368 --> 03:28.374
- Yes.

03:40.816 --> 03:42.570
Please.

03:44.323 --> 03:45.743
Please.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.377
- She is a child.
- She's not.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.716
She's 18.
Look at this.

04:55.716 --> 04:57.804
All the things they're saying
about her online.

04:57.804 --> 04:59.139
The best
you can do right now

04:59.139 --> 05:01.060
is keep your heads up
and your mouths closed.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.439
You're gonna try to get
the case dismissed, right?

05:03.439 --> 05:04.483
- Yeah, but we won't
be able to.

05:04.483 --> 05:05.903
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

05:05.903 --> 05:07.114
- Gail--
- David.

05:07.114 --> 05:08.575
Why not?

05:08.575 --> 05:10.286
- They've got too much evidence
for dismissal.

05:10.286 --> 05:12.792
- She wasn't anywhere
near that boy that night.

05:12.792 --> 05:15.338
- You're right.
- So tell that to the judge.

05:15.338 --> 05:18.637
- We will.
- You don't get it.

05:20.390 --> 05:22.352
I want to tell our story.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.903
- You mean testify?

05:26.903 --> 05:28.406
- Yeah, exactly.

05:30.076 --> 05:31.746
- I would advise against that.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.882
- The jury needs
to understand us,

05:36.882 --> 05:38.844
our love story.

05:38.844 --> 05:41.516
- Your--your love story?

05:44.772 --> 05:46.693
Right.
Yeah.

05:46.693 --> 05:49.114
Um...

05:49.114 --> 05:53.957
Can you, uh, read that for me?
Out loud, please.

06:01.138 --> 06:03.685
- "So you do have hope,
I told you."

06:03.685 --> 06:05.981
- Uh, no, uh,
the one below that one.

06:08.737 --> 06:11.492
- "I don't want you to live
like this every day, though."

06:11.492 --> 06:15.876
Yeah, and that one.

06:21.136 --> 06:22.765
Go on.

06:26.523 --> 06:28.568
- "Why don't you
just drink bleach?"

06:36.876 --> 06:40.049
Okay, "I never
<i>had feelings for another girl.</i>

06:40.049 --> 06:42.304
"It was only her
that I felt that way about,

06:42.304 --> 06:43.724
"so she really messed me up

06:43.724 --> 06:45.519
"because, for a while,
I was confused,

06:45.519 --> 06:47.940
and then her mom got involved
and ruined our lives."

06:47.940 --> 06:51.906
That is copy and pasted
to all of her friends.

06:51.906 --> 06:53.535
You don't think that sounds
like a girl

06:53.535 --> 06:55.664
who would do anything to get
Susie's attention?

06:55.664 --> 06:58.587
- She sounds heartbroken to me.

06:58.587 --> 06:59.964
- The fucking paper?

06:59.964 --> 07:01.008
- Mrs. Roy.

07:01.008 --> 07:03.262
- I'm gonna give
you two a moment.

07:03.262 --> 07:06.519
- I have to learn about this
from the paper?

07:17.499 --> 07:21.006
So you think
he didn't kill himself?

07:23.260 --> 07:24.471
- No, um...

07:26.141 --> 07:29.314
No, he--he did.
Um...

07:29.314 --> 07:31.653
but leading up to his suicide,

07:31.653 --> 07:34.282
Michelle was
in constant contact,

07:34.282 --> 07:36.328
encouraging him.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.794
- How do you know?

07:39.794 --> 07:42.550
- There are text messages
between the two of them,

07:42.550 --> 07:45.179
thousands of them.

07:45.179 --> 07:47.225
- Why would she do that?

07:47.225 --> 07:48.895
- We're still piecing
that together.

07:50.231 --> 07:52.987
There is something
that you could do.

07:52.987 --> 07:54.949
We'd like you
to testify at trial,

07:54.949 --> 08:00.459
talk about Coco, his life, uh,
what he wanted for his future.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.804
We'd also like you
to talk about Michelle.

08:07.140 --> 08:08.727
- Me?
Why?

08:08.727 --> 08:10.689
You have a relationship
with her.

08:10.689 --> 08:13.277
She reached out to you.

08:15.156 --> 08:16.993
- So you think
she'll go to jail?

08:16.993 --> 08:20.291
- I will do everything in
my power to make that happen.

08:22.086 --> 08:25.218
- Uh, what about Co?
He'll testify, too?

08:26.261 --> 08:30.896
- Uh, the defense would
bring up the--uh, the incident

08:30.896 --> 08:33.275
that happened last year.

08:33.275 --> 08:34.820
It would discredit him.

08:34.820 --> 08:37.325
- He loved Coco.
- I know, um,

08:37.325 --> 08:39.412
but it's the defense's job

08:39.412 --> 08:42.418
to make it seem like it's
anyone's fault but Michelle.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.759
We need you.

08:48.264 --> 08:49.684
- I'll think about it.

08:55.236 --> 08:57.365
We were close,

08:57.365 --> 08:59.579
but that was a long time ago.

08:59.579 --> 09:02.083
- She spoke to Conrad
about you quite a bit.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.712
We interviewed a couple
of Michelle's friends,

09:03.712 --> 09:05.674
and they said
you were important to her,

09:05.674 --> 09:07.803
but you two had
some kind of falling out.

09:07.803 --> 09:09.515
- Well, he was obsessed
with Susie.

09:09.515 --> 09:12.521
- Do you mind
if, um, she tells us?

09:14.482 --> 09:15.484
- No.

09:16.571 --> 09:19.994
- She wasn't getting along
with her friends from school.

09:19.994 --> 09:23.835
Same for me, so we talked.

09:25.087 --> 09:26.966
- Why did you stop talking?

09:26.966 --> 09:30.641
- After a while,
she became needy.

09:32.393 --> 09:33.605
Intense.

09:33.605 --> 09:35.901
Michelle kept Susie up
all night,

09:35.901 --> 09:37.445
so I told her to cut it out,

09:37.445 --> 09:39.407
but that girl wouldn't take no
for an answer,

09:39.407 --> 09:42.706
so I took Susie's phone,
and even that didn't stop her.

09:42.706 --> 09:45.712
She messaged her online.
She left notes in the car.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.471
- Do you have any of those?

09:52.058 --> 09:53.853
- Yeah.

10:02.078 --> 10:04.082
- When was the last time
you talked to Michelle?

10:04.082 --> 10:08.675
- After I saw the news.
I texted her.

10:10.554 --> 10:12.306
I thought it was
the nice thing to do.

10:13.434 --> 10:16.064
She texted me
a couple more times.

10:16.064 --> 10:17.693
I didn't respond.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.168
Here you go.

10:34.602 --> 10:37.858
- Do you mind if we keep this?
- No.

10:39.737 --> 10:41.657
- Have you read that?

10:45.749 --> 10:47.376
- Michelle texted
the other girls

10:47.376 --> 10:48.713
that you were her first kiss.

10:48.713 --> 10:51.301
- What?
- It's not true.

10:52.638 --> 10:54.390
- What is this all about?

10:54.390 --> 10:57.856
- We are looking
into Michelle's involvement

10:57.856 --> 10:59.275
in Conrad's death.

10:59.275 --> 11:00.612
What does this have
to do with us?

11:00.612 --> 11:03.618
- We can't go into the details,
but it's possible

11:03.618 --> 11:05.496
that Michelle's actions
were an attempt

11:05.496 --> 11:07.626
to get
your daughter's attention.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.353
I think
we should go to the lake.

11:17.353 --> 11:18.857
What?
Why?

11:18.857 --> 11:22.781
- To get away from the press
and our neighbors, this house.

11:22.781 --> 11:24.284
Any of it. All of it.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.873
- Then it will look like
we have something to hide.

11:28.543 --> 11:30.337
- Don't we?

11:32.341 --> 11:34.972
She told him to drink bleach.

11:34.972 --> 11:36.642
- You don't know the context.

11:36.642 --> 11:39.899
- Can you think of a context
in which any of this is okay?

11:41.443 --> 11:43.573
And can you imagine what other
late-night exchanges

11:43.573 --> 11:44.783
she had with that boy?

12:00.649 --> 12:03.821
- Hayden?
- Go away.

12:03.821 --> 12:07.871
- What's wrong?
Tell me what's wrong.

12:07.871 --> 12:10.752
- I'm the murderer's sister.
That's what's wrong!

12:12.714 --> 12:14.802
Get the fuck out.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.780
- Natalie.

12:27.368 --> 12:29.832
Hey, Natalie.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.084
- I'm not allowed
to talk to you.

12:34.550 --> 12:36.929
- I know a lot of people
are saying a lot of things.

12:36.929 --> 12:39.560
I just wanted to explain.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.522
I think,
if I could just explain,

12:41.522 --> 12:43.025
you would understand.

12:43.025 --> 12:45.029
- The lawyer said we can't
talk to you.

12:45.029 --> 12:46.532
I'm sorry.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.703
- The lawyer?
- Yeah, I'm--I'm sorry.

12:48.703 --> 12:51.332
I, um--me and Cassie--

12:53.462 --> 12:55.550
I can't say anything else.

12:55.550 --> 12:57.637
- Hate to be
her next boyfriend.

13:18.220 --> 13:19.723
Brad's a dick,

13:19.723 --> 13:22.186
which is funny, 'cause I hear
he has a micro penis.

13:24.650 --> 13:26.529
Don't let people
like that get to you.

13:27.948 --> 13:30.369
- Yeah, thanks.

13:30.369 --> 13:32.582
You're going to prom?

13:32.582 --> 13:34.628
- I don't know.

13:34.628 --> 13:37.424
I don't think
anybody really wants me there.

13:37.424 --> 13:39.513
- Look, I've been a part
of enough rumors to know

13:39.513 --> 13:41.642
that they're usually bullshit.

13:41.642 --> 13:42.686
I don't want you to miss out

13:42.686 --> 13:44.438
just 'cause of what's going on.

13:47.111 --> 13:48.823
- What are the rumors?

13:48.823 --> 13:50.577
Currently,
that I'm having an affair

13:50.577 --> 13:52.706
with the swim coach.

13:52.706 --> 13:56.004
He's too old for me.

14:01.139 --> 14:03.059
- I meant about me.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.899
- It's just stupid gossip.

14:05.899 --> 14:09.071
I don't believe any of it,
if that matters.

14:11.869 --> 14:13.496
- Of course it does.

14:25.772 --> 14:28.694
- Yes, sir?
- You wanna bring her in?

14:28.694 --> 14:32.201
- The boat?
- Yes, the boat.

14:32.201 --> 14:33.495
You see another her
around here?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.712
You don't have to.

14:37.712 --> 14:39.173
I just thought you'd
like to give it a try.

14:39.173 --> 14:40.342
- No, no, no.
I do.

14:40.342 --> 14:41.720
- Come on.
Get over here, hotshot.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.524
All right.
She's all yours.

14:47.524 --> 14:49.026
Keep her steady.

14:59.422 --> 15:01.175
Very nice.

15:04.015 --> 15:06.645
Yeah, graduation
coming up, huh?

15:09.651 --> 15:11.279
You know, the guys were saying

15:11.279 --> 15:13.450
they really like
working with you.

15:16.414 --> 15:18.502
Yeah, I was thinking
I--I wasn't much older than you

15:18.502 --> 15:21.508
when I started working with
your grandfather full time.

15:27.937 --> 15:30.735
I--I'm just saying
there's a future in it.

15:30.735 --> 15:32.237
That's all.

15:47.309 --> 15:48.938
That's it.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.049
Tell me.

18:10.846 --> 18:12.391
I don't know.

18:12.391 --> 18:16.023
I'm really not doing good.

18:16.023 --> 18:17.442
- What do you mean?

18:18.904 --> 18:22.995
- I just have all these issues
with my body image.

18:25.668 --> 18:27.505
It's consuming my life.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.930
I'm bingeing,
and I can't lose weight,

18:31.930 --> 18:34.519
and it just makes me so upset.

18:36.773 --> 18:39.027
I'm thinking I need to go
somewhere to get help.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.244
- I wish I had your problems
and you had mine.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.795
- I have your problems,
too, hell.

18:47.795 --> 18:49.507
Everyone seems to think
they know what's best for me,

18:49.507 --> 18:51.887
and I'm just gonna
disappoint everybody.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.435
It's so hard
for people to like me.

18:56.605 --> 18:57.607
- I like you.

18:58.901 --> 19:00.278
- I know.

19:03.201 --> 19:04.829
I want to see you.

19:08.419 --> 19:11.300
- Can I tell you something?

19:11.300 --> 19:15.141
Okay.

19:15.141 --> 19:17.563
- You know that girl Susie?

19:17.563 --> 19:18.982
Sure.

19:23.742 --> 19:25.579
- I liked her.

19:30.631 --> 19:34.973
- As in?
- As in I had feelings for her.

19:36.977 --> 19:38.689
I think she felt the same.

19:44.157 --> 19:45.953
Do you still love me?

19:48.416 --> 19:49.836
- Do you still love Susie?

19:52.967 --> 19:54.721
- I don't know.

19:58.979 --> 20:01.025
It's not like we would have
had a forever anything,

20:01.025 --> 20:02.402
because I have you.

20:06.035 --> 20:08.832
- I guess.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.086
- You guess?

20:14.761 --> 20:17.015
Do you think
we have a future?

20:18.727 --> 20:20.146
- A future?

20:23.319 --> 20:24.321
Conrad?

20:27.410 --> 20:28.622
Carter, Michelle.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.833
So you drove down
from Ithaca.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.087
I imagine there's lawyers
closer to home.

20:54.674 --> 20:56.678
- I'm here
because of Michelle Carter.

20:56.678 --> 20:59.141
I don't like seeing
innocent people prosecuted.

20:59.141 --> 21:00.519
- I mean, I agree with you,

21:00.519 --> 21:01.813
but how do you know
she's innocent?

21:01.813 --> 21:03.399
- I read it in the paper.

21:03.399 --> 21:05.738
Oh, you know she's
innocent 'cause of the paper.

21:05.738 --> 21:07.490
- You're skeptical.

21:07.490 --> 21:08.785
- I am.

21:08.785 --> 21:10.496
How much medication
was Miss Carter

21:10.496 --> 21:12.960
and the young man on
at the time of his passing?

21:14.254 --> 21:15.716
- How'd you know that?

21:22.020 --> 21:23.189
It's my job.

21:26.028 --> 21:29.952
- When you get to be my age,
it's how you look inside.

21:29.952 --> 21:32.708
If Michelle was taking
multiple medications,

21:32.708 --> 21:36.800
it's possible it could have had
an intoxicating effect on her,

21:36.800 --> 21:39.972
particularly if she had
a coexisting condition,

21:39.972 --> 21:42.185
like an eating disorder?

21:42.185 --> 21:45.024
That can increase the half-life
of certain medications.

21:45.024 --> 21:48.657
Elevated liver transaminases
occurs frequently

21:48.657 --> 21:50.828
at patients' nadir weights.

21:50.828 --> 21:53.834
This generally
represents apoptosis,

21:53.834 --> 21:55.796
a programmed hepatocyte death.

21:57.423 --> 21:59.386
- I don't understand
a goddamn thing you just said.

22:00.722 --> 22:04.396
- That's okay.
I do.

22:04.396 --> 22:06.901
And I'll make sure
the jury does as well.

22:06.901 --> 22:08.530
Well, we're gonna
need something

22:08.530 --> 22:11.493
once they hear those texts.
You've testified before?

22:11.493 --> 22:13.414
- And it's led
to five acquittals,

22:13.414 --> 22:17.923
in Pennsylvania, Louisiana,
New Jersey, Alaska and Canada.

22:19.259 --> 22:20.596
- And what's your fee?

22:20.596 --> 22:23.058
- I'm not looking
for a paycheck.

22:23.058 --> 22:25.856
I want to help this girl.

22:25.856 --> 22:28.277
I want to get the news out
about the dangers

22:28.277 --> 22:29.655
of big pharma.

22:31.534 --> 22:33.245
It's my civic duty.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.301
Uh, and the oil filter.

22:42.305 --> 22:45.812
Got it.

22:45.812 --> 22:48.192
- This an okay time?

22:48.192 --> 22:50.948
- You here to ask me
about testifying too?

22:50.948 --> 22:52.952
I know Lynn says
she's thinking about it.

22:55.331 --> 22:58.295
- Actually, I'd like to get
your perspective on something.

22:59.966 --> 23:01.134
- Okay.

23:04.391 --> 23:06.938
- Our office, uh, found
a police report

23:06.938 --> 23:09.025
from last year.

23:11.405 --> 23:12.825
- And?

23:14.912 --> 23:19.421
- The, um--the assault
on your son.

23:19.421 --> 23:20.799
Lynn explained that--

23:20.799 --> 23:22.093
- She explained what?
- That that night was--

23:22.093 --> 23:23.304
- She wasn't there.

23:23.304 --> 23:25.308
- I understand.
- It wasn't an assault.

23:28.147 --> 23:29.775
- What was it?

23:33.658 --> 23:35.328
- Fathers and sons.

23:38.835 --> 23:41.006
But you wouldn't get that.

23:45.807 --> 23:47.310
Anything else?

23:47.310 --> 23:48.605
- Unless you have
any questions for me.

23:48.605 --> 23:50.441
- No, I don't.

23:50.441 --> 23:52.571
- Thank you so much
for your time, Mr. Roy.

24:16.243 --> 24:18.038
We need to talk.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.378
- Can we do this later?
- No.

24:23.215 --> 24:25.177
A lawyer came by.

24:25.177 --> 24:26.681
- And?

24:26.681 --> 24:29.645
- You told the fucking DA
about what happened with Coco?

24:29.645 --> 24:32.150
- Told?
She already knew.

24:32.150 --> 24:33.485
- It wasn't your place
to say anything.

24:33.485 --> 24:37.368
This was between me and my son,
not you!

24:37.368 --> 24:40.750
- He was my son, too.
My son.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.546
And you kicked the shit
out of him,

24:42.546 --> 24:44.424
and if you use
this father and son thing

24:44.424 --> 24:47.221
one more goddamn time--
I don't get to use that excuse.

24:47.221 --> 24:49.058
- You use plenty of excuses.

24:49.058 --> 24:50.311
- What is that supposed
to mean?

24:50.311 --> 24:51.898
- He was living with you
when it happened.

24:55.655 --> 24:57.033
Fuck it.
Never mind.

24:57.033 --> 24:58.285
Go ahead and say it.

24:58.285 --> 24:59.663
I know you want to,
you fucking prick.

24:59.663 --> 25:01.542
- Go inside, Lynn.
- You think I don't know?

25:01.542 --> 25:03.378
You think I don't think
about it every goddamn night?

25:03.378 --> 25:05.382
I'm a terrible fucking mother?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.266
- God, Mom.

25:33.690 --> 25:34.858
What?

25:37.573 --> 25:39.868
- Grandma died.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.835
- Oh.

25:49.137 --> 25:51.934
- Your sister and I
will be upstairs.

25:51.934 --> 25:53.353
- Okay.

26:27.964 --> 26:29.677
- Mae wants to talk to you.

26:31.054 --> 26:32.473
- Mae?

26:38.276 --> 26:41.366
No, that's okay.
- Nah, that's okay?

26:43.621 --> 26:44.998
No, you know what?
You're right.

26:44.998 --> 26:47.086
Her elbows are a little--
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

26:48.965 --> 26:50.635
I wouldn't know what to say.

26:50.635 --> 26:52.304
Just be
your fucking self, man.

26:54.643 --> 26:56.271
What's going on?

26:57.941 --> 27:00.655
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.

27:00.655 --> 27:02.450
I'm just being a baby.

27:04.412 --> 27:05.707
Look, things
are gonna be different

27:05.707 --> 27:07.168
when you're here
at Fitchburg next year.

27:42.154 --> 27:45.118
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

27:57.811 --> 27:59.438
- I like that you don't
talk much.

28:04.282 --> 28:05.994
See you back out there.

29:17.512 --> 29:20.518
- So you want to tell me
what happened?

29:21.812 --> 29:24.108
- I just didn't want
to be there anymore.

29:26.279 --> 29:27.364
- Okay.

29:29.285 --> 29:30.872
- I don't want to go back.

29:30.872 --> 29:32.291
- Why?

29:34.170 --> 29:36.090
- I don't want
to go to school there.

29:38.136 --> 29:41.560
I'm good on the boat,
and Dad says--

29:41.560 --> 29:43.271
- What about your scholarship?

29:47.906 --> 29:49.325
- Maybe.
I don't know.

29:50.828 --> 29:53.793
- Are you high?
- Yeah.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.132
- Let's talk about this
when you're not stoned.

29:58.719 --> 30:00.347
- Jesus fucking Christ.

30:00.347 --> 30:02.267
- Excuse me?

30:02.267 --> 30:04.606
- It's not
the fucking weed, okay?

30:06.025 --> 30:07.444
It's me.

30:08.656 --> 30:10.242
- Do you want
to talk to somebody?

30:10.242 --> 30:12.246
- No, I don't want to talk
to somebody, okay?

30:12.246 --> 30:14.543
Actually, I need you
to stop talking.

30:14.543 --> 30:18.258
Just give me a break, okay?
I need you, I need Dad,

30:18.258 --> 30:21.515
and I need everybody else to
just give me a fucking break.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.006
So we have
Michelle Carter's friends

30:59.006 --> 31:01.052
from high school, Natalie
Gibson and Cassie Wilkins,

31:01.052 --> 31:02.680
on the witness list.
All relevant?

31:02.680 --> 31:03.849
- Yes, Your Honor.

31:03.849 --> 31:05.101
I see we have not
included

31:05.101 --> 31:06.228
Miss Carter on this list.

31:06.228 --> 31:07.397
- Uh, that's correct,
Your Honor.

31:07.397 --> 31:08.567
Miss Carter
will not be testifying.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.655
- Susie Pierce?
- Uh, we object.

31:10.655 --> 31:13.117
Miss Pierce has no connection
to the case and hasn't spoken

31:13.117 --> 31:15.665
to Miss Carter for years
prior to Mr. Roy's death.

31:15.665 --> 31:18.127
- She was a friend
of the defendant.

31:22.344 --> 31:24.098
We believe that Michelle Carter

31:24.098 --> 31:26.185
may have orchestrated
Conrad's death

31:26.185 --> 31:29.441
in order to get the attention
and sympathy of Susie Pierce.

31:31.112 --> 31:32.740
- Who is Dr. Peter Breggin?

31:32.740 --> 31:34.034
Oh, he's
a psychologist.

31:34.034 --> 31:35.705
He submitted a full report
on the mental health

31:35.705 --> 31:37.625
of Michelle Carter
and Conrad Roy III.

31:37.625 --> 31:39.504
- Are these police officers
from the crime scene?

31:39.504 --> 31:40.881
- No, no, no, they'll speak

31:40.881 --> 31:42.802
to reports
of the sustained domestic abuse

31:42.802 --> 31:44.179
experienced inside
the household

31:44.179 --> 31:46.225
which could have influenced
the young man's death.

31:46.225 --> 31:49.273
- These officers and EMTs
were not present on the night

31:49.273 --> 31:51.360
of the incident
with Conrad Roy Jr.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.239
and Conrad Roy III.

31:53.239 --> 31:55.493
The hearsay rule
forbids them

31:55.493 --> 31:57.247
from being admitted
into evidence.

31:57.247 --> 31:59.126
So none--none of them
were there?

31:59.126 --> 32:01.005
- One of them was,
Officer Tavares.

32:01.005 --> 32:02.382
- Then why are the rest
of these officers

32:02.382 --> 32:03.594
on the witness list?

32:03.594 --> 32:05.388
- Oh, well,
because Mr. Cataldo plans

32:05.388 --> 32:07.852
to raise issues that happened
well before the victim's death

32:07.852 --> 32:10.691
in order to raise suspicion
about a home life that was,

32:10.691 --> 32:13.655
except this incident,
loving and attentive.

32:13.655 --> 32:15.075
- But some girl that my client

32:15.075 --> 32:17.496
hasn't spoken to in two years
is somehow the--

32:17.496 --> 32:19.166
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

32:19.166 --> 32:21.087
Here's what we're gonna do.

32:21.087 --> 32:23.174
Officer Tavares is admitted.

32:23.174 --> 32:26.472
Susie Pierce and the other
officers and EMTs are not.

32:26.472 --> 32:27.767
And we're gonna limit
the scope

32:27.767 --> 32:29.103
of the investigation
to 18 months--

32:29.103 --> 32:30.523
- Your Honor,
I would like to make a--

32:30.523 --> 32:32.234
Let me finish.
Let me finish.

32:32.234 --> 32:34.154
We're gonna limit the scope
of the investigation

32:34.154 --> 32:36.868
to 18 months
prior to Mr. Roy's passing.

32:36.868 --> 32:38.246
- Judge, 18 months--
- Your Honor, I would like--

32:38.246 --> 32:39.414
That's--that's--
that's my ruling.

32:39.414 --> 32:40.960
That's my ruling.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.007
Thank you.
<i>Well, we lost our motive.</i>

32:44.007 --> 32:45.761
He lost his defense.
Call it even?

32:45.761 --> 32:46.847
- Fuck.

32:46.847 --> 32:48.266
- I reviewed
the defense's discovery,

32:48.266 --> 32:50.228
the doctor's report.

32:50.228 --> 32:51.355
- What, Breggin?

32:51.355 --> 32:52.775
- Yeah, there's nothing there.

32:52.775 --> 32:54.863
Interview with Carter's mother,
her neighbor,

32:54.863 --> 32:56.365
her softball coach.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.994
- Not her friends?
- No, it seems not.

32:57.994 --> 33:00.331
- Great, okay, well,
you know, we just--we--

33:00.331 --> 33:01.793
we roll with the punches.

33:01.793 --> 33:03.337
We take what we have,
and we just roll with them.

33:03.337 --> 33:04.591
- You're gonna roll
into hyperventilation

33:04.591 --> 33:05.885
if you don't slow down.

33:05.885 --> 33:08.264
her friends.

33:08.264 --> 33:10.769
She was in touch with Natalie
and Cassie the entire time,

33:10.769 --> 33:13.316
texting them that Conrad
was missing for days

33:13.316 --> 33:15.529
when she knew for a fact
that he was still alive.

33:15.529 --> 33:17.700
- She was testing the waters.

33:17.700 --> 33:20.330
She was trying
to get their attention.

33:22.292 --> 33:26.050
We make all her friends Susie.

33:56.903 --> 33:59.283
- Hi.

33:59.283 --> 34:00.451
- Hey.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.923
- You look different
than Florida,

34:06.923 --> 34:09.887
but--but the same.

34:09.887 --> 34:10.889
Is that weird?

34:10.889 --> 34:15.481
- No, no, I get it.

34:16.735 --> 34:19.323
- I must look terrible.

34:19.323 --> 34:21.703
- Well, it's a funeral.
No one looks good.

34:26.170 --> 34:28.174
Are you, um, headed

34:28.174 --> 34:31.598
to the--like, the reception?

34:31.598 --> 34:33.017
- I'm supposed to.

34:35.104 --> 34:37.233
I don't really want to go.

34:37.233 --> 34:40.114
Just gonna be a bunch
of people crying,

34:40.114 --> 34:41.450
wondering why I'm not.

34:42.870 --> 34:44.289
- I get that.

34:49.550 --> 34:51.178
Do you wanna go somewhere?

34:58.944 --> 35:00.363
- What are we doing?

35:01.741 --> 35:02.952
- Batter up!

35:14.307 --> 35:16.980
Strike one!
Perfect fastball by Roy.

35:16.980 --> 35:20.779
Carter seems nervous,
intimidated by the star's arm.

35:30.173 --> 35:33.345
Carter seems woefully
unprepared for Roy's next move.

35:33.345 --> 35:34.682
Uh-uh.

35:34.682 --> 35:35.726
Yeah.

35:40.401 --> 35:43.073
Just a little late!

35:53.720 --> 35:56.099
Oh, okay.

36:01.193 --> 36:04.032
- Oh, Carter gets
a piece of it!

36:04.032 --> 36:08.499
Oh, it goes deep left.
Roy takes off after it.

36:11.129 --> 36:12.340
- Ah!
- Oh!

36:12.340 --> 36:14.846
Can Carter make it
a homer?

36:14.846 --> 36:16.014
No, no, no, no!

36:16.014 --> 36:17.016
She makes it
to third.

36:17.016 --> 36:19.437
Will Roy make it?

36:23.530 --> 36:24.949
She's out!

36:33.382 --> 36:34.886
- You tired already?

36:36.471 --> 36:39.019
- I haven't had any complaints
about my stamina.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.711
- Thanks.

36:54.132 --> 36:55.969
- Yeah, anytime.

37:06.490 --> 37:08.369
Do you want to talk about it?

37:11.960 --> 37:13.713
- I'm sad, I guess.

37:15.717 --> 37:17.972
I don't know.
Numb.

37:20.393 --> 37:22.105
- Yeah.

37:22.105 --> 37:24.568
- I keep wondering what
her last moments were like.

37:26.279 --> 37:28.158
Was she scared?

37:32.500 --> 37:34.421
What do you think
dying is like?

37:38.095 --> 37:40.224
- Just like floating
on the water.

37:42.186 --> 37:43.397
No pain.

37:44.775 --> 37:48.575
No anxiety.
Just peace.

37:54.670 --> 37:59.345
Would you be sad if I died?

38:01.851 --> 38:03.437
- Of course.

38:07.821 --> 38:10.034
I would miss you every day.

38:16.923 --> 38:20.471
- What would you say
at my funeral?

38:22.016 --> 38:25.439
- I would say I was so lucky
to have you as my boyfriend.

38:38.090 --> 38:41.931
I would say,
"Ours was an epic love story.

38:44.310 --> 38:48.695
Like all real love stories,
ours will die with us."

38:54.080 --> 38:56.293
What would you say at mine?

39:03.725 --> 39:05.770
- She was terrible at baseball.

40:10.357 --> 40:12.654
- Wait.

40:12.654 --> 40:14.658
Are you okay?

40:14.658 --> 40:16.328
- Yes.

40:24.260 --> 40:27.433
I'm not... ready.

40:33.654 --> 40:35.575
- Are you sure?

40:44.175 --> 40:45.804
That's okay.

41:04.424 --> 41:05.635
- Sorry.

41:05.635 --> 41:10.603
- It's okay.
Just--just give me a minute.

41:31.186 --> 41:33.106
What are you...

41:49.723 --> 41:51.852
- I love you, Conrad.

42:02.206 --> 42:07.174
Are you sure you want
to go to this

42:07.174 --> 42:09.555
with everything?

42:09.555 --> 42:11.934
It just might, you know,
look a little--

42:13.311 --> 42:15.567
- I'm not gonna let
my whole senior year be ruined.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.620
- Okay.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.296
Here.

42:26.296 --> 42:27.757
Uh, I thought
this would be nice.

42:27.757 --> 42:31.139
It matches your dress.
Open.

42:38.821 --> 42:43.664
Gorgeous.
Ah, for later.

42:46.169 --> 42:50.427
- Thanks, Mom.

42:50.427 --> 42:51.805
Okay, can we get

42:51.805 --> 42:53.141
the two pictures
really quickly?

43:05.958 --> 43:08.964
- You ready?

43:08.964 --> 43:10.300
We got this.

43:10.300 --> 43:12.555


45:03.694 --> 45:05.196
Hey.

45:09.664 --> 45:11.125
- I just want to go home.

45:12.294 --> 45:14.006
- Is there someone I can call?

45:18.599 --> 45:20.519
There's no one left.

45:23.024 --> 45:26.531
- Maybe, um...
- No.

45:32.794 --> 45:34.673
I miss my friends.

45:37.177 --> 45:38.806
I just--I've got to go.

45:38.806 --> 45:40.183
Let me just get
you home.

45:40.183 --> 45:41.520
- Yeah, no, I'll walk.
