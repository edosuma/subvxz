Exactly.

the deal for August Marks.

Just having proof there's a body
on one of his properties...

24:34.682 --> 24:36.468

Look, the leverage of him losing
an empire he can almost touch...

25:04.962 --> 25:08.295

to back Marks off.

of your husband...

25:13.012 --> 25:15.879

with an informed third party.

in the background.

to pay him.

and my credibility will be ruined.

Mr. Marks won't provide much leverage.
