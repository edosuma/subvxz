01:16.452 --> 01:18.661
Thank you very much, sir.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.913
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.374
Shh. Shh.

01:23.459 --> 01:24.876
We did it, Pete. We did it.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.671
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.

01:28.756 --> 01:32.175
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case -

01:32.259 --> 01:34.051
murder in the first degree.

01:34.136 --> 01:39.098
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.933
You've listened to the testimony.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.936
You've had the law read to you and
interpreted as it applies in this case.

01:44.021 --> 01:48.024
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.487
One man is dead. Another
man's life is at stake.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.283
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused -

01:57.367 --> 01:59.285
a reasonable doubt -

01:59.369 --> 02:02.163
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.123
Now if, however, there's
no reasonable doubt...

02:04.208 --> 02:08.085
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

02:09.213 --> 02:13.341
However you decide, your
verdict must be unanimous.

02:13.425 --> 02:16.803
In the event that you
find the accused guilty...

02:16.887 --> 02:20.223
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.518
The death sentence is
mandatory in this case.

02:23.602 --> 02:27.313
You're faced with a grave
responsibility. Thank you, gentlemen.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.359
The alternate jurors are excused.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.367
The jury will now retire.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.362
Try this one. See if I can get it -

04:40.697 --> 04:42.448
It's a muggy day.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.079
Hey. Oh, oh.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.218
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.387
This thing is -

05:04.471 --> 05:06.097
- Huh?
- ... move it.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.892
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.310
That's it.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.567
- You know something?
- Yeah?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.403
I called the weather
bureau this morning.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.405
This is gonna be the
hottest day of the year.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.073
Could be.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.075
Boy, you'd think they'd at
least air-condition these places.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.495
- What is your name, sir? -
Oh, it's, uh - That one, yeah.

05:29.579 --> 05:30.997
Thank you very much.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.833
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.752
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.088
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.810
Good morning.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.353
I never knew they locked the door.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.605
Sure they lock the
door. What'd you think?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.109
I don't know. It just
never occurred to me.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.529
What's that for?

06:03.613 --> 06:05.489
Oh, I thought we might
want to vote by ballot.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.242
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.246
Just in case, you know.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.877
- Î—ow'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.628
It was pretty interesting.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.672
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.341
I mean, I've never
been on a jury before.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.136
No? I've sat on many juries.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.223
What gets me is the way those
lawyers talk and talk and talk...

06:31.308 --> 06:33.476
even when it's an open-and-shut
case like this one.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.269
Did you ever hear so
much talk about nothin'?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.229
Well, I guess they're entitled.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.774
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but -

06:40.984 --> 06:45.071
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough
kids down before they start any trouble.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.239
It would save us a
lot of time and money.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.866
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.577
Yeah, let's get goin', huh? We
probably all got things to do here.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.705
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute
break. There's one gentleman in the bathroom.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.748
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?

06:55.832 --> 06:58.626
- Are, uh - Are we gonna sit
in order? - Gee, I don't know.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.461
I, uh
- Well, I guess so.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.926
Uh, you're in my seat.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.011
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.307
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.396
What did you think of the case?

07:19.481 --> 07:21.524
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.735
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

07:25.612 --> 07:28.072
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.116
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.451
Boy, they can be the dullest.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.329
Hey.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.997
That the Woolworth Building?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.999
That's right.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.668
Isn't that funny?

07:40.752 --> 07:43.129
You know, I've lived here all my
life. I've never been inside that.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.297
If you had to sort out all that junk -

07:45.382 --> 07:47.466
Like that thing with the movies.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.553
Yeah. You can say that again. And what
about that business with the knife?

07:50.637 --> 07:53.514
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

07:53.598 --> 07:56.058
Well, I expected that. You
know what we're dealing with.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.602
Yeah, I guess so.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.396
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.524
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.818
These hot-weather colds can kill you.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.320
I can hardly touch my
nose. You know what I mean?

08:08.405 --> 08:11.949
I sure do. I just got over one.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.785
Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman,
let's go here, huh?

08:14.870 --> 08:16.495
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.415
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a
chance to see a paper this morning.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.583
Hmm?

08:20.667 --> 08:23.085
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.880
You got a seat on the Exchange?

08:25.964 --> 08:27.715
I'm a broker.

08:27.799 --> 08:32.178
I run a messenger service
- the Beck and Call Company.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.388
The name is my wife's idea.

08:34.472 --> 08:38.100
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.352
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.358
Yeah, we can all get outta
here pretty quick, huh?

08:46.443 --> 08:49.653
I don't know about the rest of you, but I
happen to have tickets to that ball game tonight.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.572
Yanks and Cleveland.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.449
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.201
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.411
You know
- Phoom!

08:57.495 --> 08:59.747
A real jug handle. You know?

08:59.831 --> 09:02.082
Phoom!

09:02.167 --> 09:04.501
You're a real baseball
fan, aren't you? Huh? Yeah.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.045
Where do we sit here?

09:06.129 --> 09:09.215
Well, I thought we'd sit in
order, you know, by jury numbers.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.717
One, two, three, four, five
- so on, around the table.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.052
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.220
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

09:14.304 --> 09:17.348
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.683
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around -

09:19.768 --> 09:23.020
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.439
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

09:25.523 --> 09:27.233
Okay. Two. You're two.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.484
I beg pardon?

09:28.568 --> 09:32.738
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.950
Logical sequence. I was very impressed.

09:36.034 --> 09:39.036
I think he
- he did an expert job.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.122
A lot of drive too,
you know? Real drive.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.291
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.960
Uh, fellas.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.505
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.342
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.096
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid kills his father
- bing, just like that.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.765
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.767
They let those kids run wild up there.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.561
Well, maybe it serves 'em
right. You know what I mean?

10:04.646 --> 10:06.230
Is
- Is everyone here?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.148
The old man is inside.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.859
Oh. Would you, uh, knock
on the door for him?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.903
You a Yankee fan?

10:12.988 --> 10:14.530
No. Baltimore.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.949
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.786
That's like being hit in the
head with a crowbar once a day.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.789
Who have they got?

10:23.873 --> 10:26.292
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

10:26.376 --> 10:27.918
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.046
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen. I
- I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.632
Baltimore?

10:33.717 --> 10:36.510
Okay, gentlemen, if I
can have your attention.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.555
You fellas can handle this
thing any way that you want to.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.141
I'm, um
- You know, I'm not gonna make any rules.

10:42.225 --> 10:45.519
Uh, we can, well, discuss it
first and, uh, then vote on it.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.272
That's, of course, uh
- That's, uh, one way.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.317
And, uh, well, we can
vote on it right now, and -

10:51.401 --> 10:53.902
I think it's customary to
take a preliminary vote.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.573
Yeah, let's
- Let's vote. Who knows? Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.366
Uh-huh.

10:59.451 --> 11:02.536
Okay, then I think that, uh -

11:02.620 --> 11:05.497
Of course you know that we have a
first-degree murder charge here...

11:05.582 --> 11:07.666
and if we vote the accused guilty...

11:07.751 --> 11:11.003
uh, we've got to send him to the chair.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.840
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.675
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.554
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

11:21.765 --> 11:26.352
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that
this has to be 12 to nothing either way.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.895
Um, that's the law.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.022
Okay, are we ready?

11:30.106 --> 11:33.108
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.616
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

11:41.951 --> 11:44.536
eight, nine, 10, 11.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.539
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.124
Those voting not guilty.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.378
One. Right.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.755
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.257
Well, now we know where we are.

11:57.342 --> 12:01.512
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.348
So, what do we do now?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.266
Well, I guess we talk.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.684
Boy, oh, boy.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.603
You really think he's innocent?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.608
I don't know.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.569
I mean, you sat in court with the
rest of us. You heard what we did.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.780
The kid's a dangerous
killer. You could see it.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.490
He's 18 years old.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.659
Well, that's old enough. Î—e -

12:23.743 --> 12:26.412
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.747
They proved it a dozen
different ways in court.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.375
Would you like me to list them for you?

12:31.459 --> 12:32.751
No.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.920
Then what do you want?

12:35.004 --> 12:37.923
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

12:38.007 --> 12:39.341
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.677
No one had to think
about it twice except you.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.972
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

12:45.056 --> 12:47.766
I don't know whether I believe
it or not. Maybe I don't.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.435
So how come you vote not guilty?

12:49.519 --> 12:51.437
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.273
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

12:54.357 --> 12:56.442
without talking about it first.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.944
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.406
What, just because I voted fast?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.908
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.786
You couldn't change my mind if
you talked for a hundred years.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.872
I'm not trying to change
your mind. It's just that -

13:10.457 --> 13:12.708
We're talking about
somebody's life here.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.877
We can't decide it in five
minutes. Supposing we're wrong.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.378
"Supposing we're wrong. "

13:16.463 --> 13:18.464
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.549
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.135
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

13:23.219 --> 13:25.804
Suppose we do it in
five minutes. So what?

13:25.889 --> 13:28.015
Let's take an hour.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.017
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.896
Hmm?

13:36.065 --> 13:37.900
Who's got something to say?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.401
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.196
Great. I heard a pretty
good story last night.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.364
That's not why we're sitting here.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.619
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

13:49.871 --> 13:51.705
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

13:52.707 --> 13:56.168
Look, this kid's been kicked
around all of his life -

13:56.252 --> 14:00.172
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.466
He lived for a year and a
half in an orphanage when his -

14:02.550 --> 14:05.469
his father was serving
a jail term for forgery.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.888
It's not a very happy beginning.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.098
He's a
- a wild, angry kid.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.892
That's all he's ever
been. And you know why?

14:11.976 --> 14:15.687
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.981
He's had a
- He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

14:18.066 --> 14:21.026
I
- I just think we owe him a few words. That's all.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.655
I don't mind telling you this,
mister. We don't owe him a thing.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.824
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

14:27.909 --> 14:30.994
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- You know it.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.413
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.374
We heard the facts, didn't we?

14:35.458 --> 14:39.253
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.713
Listen, I've lived
among them all my life.

14:41.798 --> 14:45.133
You can't believe a word
they say. You know that.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.052
I mean, they're born liars.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.472
- Only an ignorant man can
believe that. - Now listen -

14:50.557 --> 14:53.392
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

14:53.476 --> 14:56.061
I think certain things should
be pointed out to this man.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.230
Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.566
Come on. We have a job
to do. Now let's do it.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.653
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.115
"The breakfast with
the built-in bounce. "

15:08.199 --> 15:09.825
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.077
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.870
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.415
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.208
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.002
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.296
Okay. Um...

15:22.380 --> 15:26.174
perhaps if the gentleman down
there who's disagreeing with us -

15:26.259 --> 15:29.553
Well, perhaps you could tell us why. You
know, let us know what you're thinking.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.014
And we might be able to show
you where you're mixed up.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.765
Well, look, maybe
- Maybe this is an idea.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.268
Now, I haven't given it much
thought, but it seems to me...

15:36.352 --> 15:40.772
that it's up to the group of us to convince
this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.400
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to -

15:44.819 --> 15:46.236
Well, it was just a quick idea.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.779
No, no, no. That's a good one.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.949
Uh, suppose we go once around the table.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.910
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.329
Well, uh -

15:56.873 --> 15:59.291
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.336
I just think he's guilty.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.921
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go. "

16:05.006 --> 16:06.506
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.133
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.469
The burden of proof's
on the prosecution.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.013
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.224
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.268
Uh, what I meant was, is -

16:20.063 --> 16:22.064
Well, I just think he's guilty.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.857
I
- I mean, somebody saw him do it.

16:23.941 --> 16:28.987
Okay. Uh, here's what I think, and I
have no personal feelings about this.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.239
I just want to talk about facts.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.368
Number one.

16:34.911 --> 16:39.039
The old man lived downstairs under
the room where the killing took place.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.249
At 10 minutes after 12:00 on
the night of the killing...

16:41.334 --> 16:45.003
he heard loud noises, said
it sounded like a fight.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.964
And he heard the kid yell
out, "I'm gonna kill ya. "

16:48.049 --> 16:50.342
A second later, he heard
a body hit the floor.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.135
Ran to the door, opened it up...

16:52.220 --> 16:54.638
saw the kid running down the
stairs and out of the house.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.014
Called the police.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.767
They came in, found the old
man with a knife in his chest.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.104
The coroner fixed the time
of death around midnight.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.272
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.526
The kid is guilty.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.611
I'm just as sentimental
as the next fella.

17:09.695 --> 17:13.573
I know he's only 18, but he's
still gotta pay for what he did.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.117
I'm with you.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.743
Okay. Are you finished?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.287
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.582
It is obvious, to me anyway, that
the boy's entire story was flimsy.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.876
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

17:24.961 --> 17:27.503
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

17:27.588 --> 17:29.423
- or who played in them.
- That's right.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.800
And no one saw him going
in or out of the theater.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.510
Listen, what about the
woman across the street?

17:33.594 --> 17:35.887
If her testimony don't
prove it, nothing does.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.306
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.809
Now, fellas, please. Let's
go in order here, huh?

17:40.893 --> 17:44.146
Just a minute. Here's a woman -

17:44.230 --> 17:46.690
Here's a woman who was lying
in bed. She can't sleep.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.692
She's dying with the
heat. You know what I mean?

17:48.776 --> 17:50.610
Anyway, she looks out the window...

17:50.695 --> 17:54.281
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.242
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.202
Everything fits.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.121
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.331
His window is right opposite
hers across the el tracks...

18:03.416 --> 18:05.083
and she swore she saw him do it.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.836
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.

18:07.920 --> 18:12.090
This el train had no passengers on
it. It was just being moved downtown.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.093
The lights were out, remember? And
they proved in court that, at night...

18:15.178 --> 18:17.596
you can look through the windows of
an el train when the lights are out...

18:17.680 --> 18:20.015
and see what's happening
on the other side.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.934
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.687
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.522
She's one of them too, isn't she?

18:30.193 --> 18:32.194
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?

18:32.278 --> 18:33.695
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.989
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.617
Oh, what's he so wise
about? I'm telling you.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.953
Okay, now come on. Now we're
not gonna get anywhere fighting.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.288
Whose turn is it next?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.208
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.213
Okay, may I -
Can I pass? It -

18:52.006 --> 18:54.049
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.260
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

18:57.345 --> 19:00.013
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

19:00.097 --> 19:04.309
I started to be convinced, you
know, very early in the case.

19:04.894 --> 19:09.022
You see, I was looking for a
motive. That's very important.

19:09.106 --> 19:13.318
Because if you don't have a
motive, where's your case, right?

19:13.402 --> 19:16.488
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

19:16.572 --> 19:19.616
in the apartment across the
hall from the kid's apartment -

19:19.700 --> 19:21.952
that was very powerful.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.830
Didn't they say something about a
- a fight and an argument...

19:24.914 --> 19:29.334
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.878
- I mean, I could be wrong,
but I - - It was 8:00.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.005
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.841
They couldn't hear what it was about.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.884
Then they heard the
father hit the boy twice.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.929
- Finally they saw the boy
run angrily out of the house.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.597
What does that prove?

19:42.682 --> 19:46.351
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.354
Well, you said it provided a motive. The
prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.690
I don't think that was
a very strong motive.

19:51.774 --> 19:55.360
This boy's been hit so many times in
his life that violence is practically a -

19:55.444 --> 19:57.821
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

19:57.905 --> 20:02.117
I just
- I can't see two slaps in the face provoking him into committing murder.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.787
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.417
Anything else?

20:10.501 --> 20:12.961
- No.
- Okay.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.796
Uh, how about you?

20:16.632 --> 20:18.592
I don't know. It's all been said.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.762
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.933
This kid is five for 0.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.894
Well, look at his record.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.187
When he was 10, he was
in children's court.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.064
He threw a rock at a teacher.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.442
When he was 15, he was in reform school.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.360
He stole a car.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.946
He's been arrested for mugging.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.032
He was picked up twice
for knife fighting.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.200
Oh, yeah, they say he's
real handy with a knife.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.078
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

20:47.163 --> 20:50.165
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.667
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.252
A kid like that?

20:54.337 --> 20:57.505
It's these kids, the
way they are nowadays.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.178
When I was a kid, I used
to call my father "sir. "

21:03.930 --> 21:05.221
That's right. "Sir. "

21:05.306 --> 21:07.265
Do you ever hear a kid call
his father that anymore?

21:07.350 --> 21:09.851
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important anymore.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.687
- You got any kids?
- Three.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.398
I got one.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.652
Twenty-two years old.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.535
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.415
I saw it. I was so
embarrassed I almost threw up.

21:34.085 --> 21:38.713
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying. "

21:41.217 --> 21:43.134
Well, I made a man out of him.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.304
When he was 16, we had a fight.

21:47.890 --> 21:50.266
Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.772
Haven't seen him for two years.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.985
Kids.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.655
Work your heart out.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.492
Well, let's get going.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.911
I think we're missing the point here.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.415
This boy, let's say he's the product of
a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

22:13.499 --> 22:17.085
We can't help that. We're here to
decide whether he's innocent or guilty...

22:17.169 --> 22:20.088
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.882
He was born in a slum. Slums are
breeding grounds for criminals.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.843
I know it, and so do you.

22:24.927 --> 22:29.639
It's no secret children from slum
backgrounds are potential menaces to society.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.891
- Now I think - - Brother,
you can say that again.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.519
The kids who crawl out of
these places are real trash.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.855
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

22:36.939 --> 22:40.650
- I, uh - I've lived in a slum
all my life. - Wait a minute.

22:40.735 --> 22:44.154
Please, I
- I played in backyards that were filled with garbage.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.281
I mean, maybe you can
still smell it on me.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.699
Now, listen, sonny.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.367
Come on now. There's
nothing personal about this.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.995
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.164
Let's not be so sensitive.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.082
This sensitivity I can understand.

22:56.167 --> 23:00.795
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and -

23:01.964 --> 23:04.090
Look, your turn down there. Let's go.

23:05.426 --> 23:08.261
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.096
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

23:10.181 --> 23:12.390
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

23:12.475 --> 23:14.809
He's the one who's keeping us in
here. Let's hear what he's got to say.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.604
Oh, now wait a minute. We
decided to do this a certain way.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.314
I think we ought to stick to that way.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.399
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

23:21.484 --> 23:23.485
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

23:23.569 --> 23:25.195
K- I-D.
Kid.

23:27.782 --> 23:31.451
What? Listen, just because I'm
trying to keep this thing organized?

23:31.535 --> 23:33.661
Here, you take it. You
take on the responsibility.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.622
I'll just
- I'll keep my mouth shut. That's all.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.707
What are you getting so hot
about? Calm down, will you?

23:37.792 --> 23:39.125
Don't tell me to calm down.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.336
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.880
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.924
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.592
The whole thing's unimportant. Come on.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.804
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.639
You're doing a beautiful job. Sit down.

23:52.723 --> 23:55.558
Yeah, you're doing
great. Just great, fella.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.519
You stay in there and pitch. You know?

23:58.479 --> 24:00.688
All right. Let's hear from somebody.

24:02.191 --> 24:06.277
Well, if you want me to tell you how I
feel about it, it's all right with me.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.488
Boy, I don't care what you do.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.449
All right, I don't
have anything brilliant.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.660
I only know as much as you do.

24:13.744 --> 24:17.497
According to the testimony, the
boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.751
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.087
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?

24:24.171 --> 24:26.631
I
- I began to get a peculiar feeling about this trial.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.800
I mean, nothing is that positive.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.010
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.805
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but -

24:33.889 --> 24:35.849
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

24:35.933 --> 24:38.434
wasn't conducting a
thorough-enough cross-examination.

24:38.519 --> 24:41.896
I mean, he - he let too many
things go by, little things that -

24:41.981 --> 24:44.732
What little things? Listen, when
these fellas don't ask questions...

24:44.817 --> 24:47.318
it's because they know the answers
already and they figure they'll be hurt.

24:47.403 --> 24:51.322
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

24:51.407 --> 24:52.699
I mean it's possible.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.450
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

24:57.538 --> 25:00.248
I
- I kept putting myself in the kid's place.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.210
I'd have asked for
another lawyer, I think.

25:04.295 --> 25:06.838
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...

25:06.922 --> 25:11.718
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

25:11.802 --> 25:15.763
Look, there was one alleged
eyewitness to this killing.

25:16.307 --> 25:19.684
Someone else claims he heard the
killing, saw the boy run out afterwards.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.895
And there was a lot of
circumstantial evidence.

25:21.979 --> 25:25.481
But actually, those two witnesses were
the entire case for the prosecution.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.358
Supposing they're wrong.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.235
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.196
What's the point of
having witnesses at all?

25:31.280 --> 25:33.907
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

25:33.991 --> 25:35.533
Those people sat on
the stand under oath.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.160
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.953
Could they be wrong?

25:39.747 --> 25:42.665
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.584
Oh, come on. Nobody can
know a thing like that.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.377
This isn't an exact science.

25:46.462 --> 25:47.795
That's right. It isn't.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.720
Okay, let
- Let's get to the point.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.389
What about the switch knife they
found in the old man's chest?

25:58.474 --> 26:00.892
Uh, wait-wait a minute. There's
some people who haven't talked yet.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.977
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.396
Be quiet a second, will you?

26:05.481 --> 26:06.773
What about it, this -

26:06.857 --> 26:10.318
the knife this fine upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

26:10.402 --> 26:11.736
Let's talk about it.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.072
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.907
I'd like to see it again. Mr. Foreman?

26:15.991 --> 26:19.077
We all saw what it looks like.
Why do we have to see it again?

26:19.161 --> 26:21.120
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.791
Say, could you bring us the knife?

26:24.875 --> 26:26.668
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

26:28.337 --> 26:31.589
The knife and the way it was bought is
pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

26:31.674 --> 26:33.341
- I do.
- Good.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.927
Now, suppose we take
these facts one at a time.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.264
One. The boy admitted going out of the
house at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

26:39.348 --> 26:41.266
after being slapped
several times by his father.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.102
No, no. No, he didn't say
"slapped. " He said "punched. "

26:44.186 --> 26:46.604
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.

26:46.689 --> 26:49.274
After being hit several
times by his father.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.609
Two. He went directly to
a neighborhood junk shop...

26:51.694 --> 26:53.820
- where he bought one of
those - - Switch knives.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.905
Switchblade knives.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.782
This wasn't what you'd
call an ordinary knife.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.368
It had a very unusual
carved handle and blade.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.953
The storekeeper who sold it to him...

27:02.037 --> 27:05.164
said it was the only one of its
kind he had ever had in stock.

27:05.249 --> 27:09.002
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.586
Am I right so far?

27:10.671 --> 27:12.797
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

27:12.881 --> 27:16.050
He talked with his friends for
about an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.095
During this time, they
saw the switch knife.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.972
Four.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.474
They identified the
death weapon in court...

27:23.559 --> 27:26.060
as that very same knife.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.938
Five. Î—e arrived home at about 10:00.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.357
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

27:31.442 --> 27:33.359
begin to diverge slightly.

27:33.444 --> 27:36.029
He claims that he went to
a movie at about 11:30...

27:36.113 --> 27:40.158
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.285
He also claims that the two
detectives who arrested him...

27:42.369 --> 27:44.662
threw him down a half
a flight of stairs.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.581
Now, what happened to the switch knife?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.292
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...

27:49.376 --> 27:54.047
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.090
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.677
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.721
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.306
No one at the theater identified him.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.516
He couldn't even remember the
names of the pictures he saw.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.271
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.566
The boy stayed home, had
another fight with his father...

28:13.650 --> 28:17.362
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.198
He even remembered to wipe the
knife clean of fingerprints.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.909
Now are you trying to
tell me that this knife...

28:22.993 --> 28:24.911
really fell through a
hole in the boy's pocket...

28:24.995 --> 28:27.372
someone picked it up off the
street, went to the boy's house...

28:27.456 --> 28:30.124
and stabbed his father with
it just to test its sharpness?

28:30.209 --> 28:32.210
No. I'm just saying it's
possible the boy lost his knife...

28:32.294 --> 28:34.504
and that somebody else stabbed
his father with a similar knife.

28:34.588 --> 28:35.797
It's just possible.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.465
Take a look at this knife.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.594
It's a very unusual knife.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.221
I've never seen one like it.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.099
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

28:46.183 --> 28:49.143
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

28:49.228 --> 28:51.562
I'm just saying a
coincidence is possible.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.147
And I say it's not possible.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.489
Where did that come from?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.949
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

29:03.033 --> 29:04.534
What do you think you're doing?

29:04.618 --> 29:06.244
Where did you get it?

29:06.328 --> 29:08.579
I went out walking for a
couple of hours last night.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.665
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.751
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

29:13.836 --> 29:15.294
It cost six dollars.

29:15.379 --> 29:18.506
It's against the law to buy
or sell switchblade knives.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.842
That's right. I broke the law.

29:20.926 --> 29:24.929
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.098
Maybe there are 10
knives like that. So what?

29:27.182 --> 29:29.976
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

29:30.060 --> 29:33.354
You found another knife like it. What's
that, the discovery of the age or something?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.773
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

29:35.858 --> 29:37.650
with exactly the same kind of knife?

29:37.734 --> 29:38.985
The odds are a
million-to-one.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.779
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.991
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.701
There's no point in standing
around all over the place.

29:48.745 --> 29:52.165
You know, it's interesting that he'd find
a knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

29:52.249 --> 29:55.001
What's interesting
about it? "Interesting. "

29:55.085 --> 29:56.961
Well, I don't know. I just
thought it was interesting.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.838
There are still 11 of us
here who think he's guilty.

29:58.922 --> 30:01.215
Right. What do you think
you're gonna accomplish?

30:01.300 --> 30:03.134
You're not gonna change anybody's mind.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.595
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.723
The kid will be tried again and
found guilty sure as he's born.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.143
That's probably right.

30:12.227 --> 30:15.438
So what are you gonna do? You
know, we could be here all night.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.774
It's only one night. A boy may die.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.402
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

30:21.487 --> 30:23.946
Someone send for Potsy the
policeman and get a pinochle deck...

30:24.031 --> 30:26.532
and, uh, we'll just sweat the
whole thing out right here.

30:28.035 --> 30:31.078
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

30:31.163 --> 30:34.832
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.835
Somebody saw the kid stab his
father. What more do we need?

30:37.920 --> 30:40.713
You guys can talk the ears right
off my head. You know what I mean?

30:40.797 --> 30:43.508
I got three garages of mine
goin' to pot while you're talking.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.259
So let's get done and get outta here.

30:45.344 --> 30:48.763
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day -

30:48.847 --> 30:51.307
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

30:51.391 --> 30:52.850
Hey, let's hold it down.

30:52.935 --> 30:55.269
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

30:58.148 --> 30:59.524
Well, what about it?

30:59.608 --> 31:01.108
You're the only one.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.077
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.913
I'm gonna call for another vote.

31:15.374 --> 31:20.586
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.713
I'll abstain.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.591
If there are 11 votes for
guilty, I won't stand alone.

31:25.676 --> 31:29.470
We'll take in a guilty
verdict to the judge right now.

31:30.931 --> 31:34.642
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.898
Well, that's it. If you
want to try it, I'm ready.

31:40.983 --> 31:42.441
All right. Let's do it the hard way.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.443
Okay, that sounds fair. Everyone agreed?

31:44.528 --> 31:46.612
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

31:46.697 --> 31:47.738
Here, pass these along.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.574
Is that the right time?

32:21.648 --> 32:47.465
"Guilty. "

32:51.553 --> 32:54.180
"Not guilty. "

32:54.264 --> 32:55.681
"Guilty. "

32:55.766 --> 32:57.433
Boy, how do you like that?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.977
Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.813
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.149
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.776
We all agreed on that, no?

33:06.860 --> 33:08.986
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret -

33:09.071 --> 33:10.946
Secret? What do you mean secret?

33:11.031 --> 33:14.241
There are no secrets in a
jury room. I know who it was.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.911
Brother, you really are something.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.996
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

33:19.081 --> 33:22.375
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

33:22.459 --> 33:25.753
about some underprivileged kid just
couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

33:25.837 --> 33:27.338
and you change your vote.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.548
If that isn't the most sick -

33:29.633 --> 33:33.302
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

33:33.387 --> 33:35.346
Oh, now just wait a minute.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.014
Listen, you can't talk to me like that.

33:37.099 --> 33:38.933
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.352
No. Who does he think
he is? Did you hear him?

33:41.436 --> 33:44.897
- It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

33:44.981 --> 33:47.817
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

33:47.901 --> 33:50.569
Someone starts telling us fairy
tales, and we're listenin'!

33:50.654 --> 33:52.405
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

33:52.489 --> 33:54.407
What made you change your vote?

33:54.491 --> 33:56.117
He didn't change his vote.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.368
I did.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.412
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.455
Would you like me to tell you why?

34:01.540 --> 34:03.416
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.043
I'd like to make it clear
anyway, if you don't mind.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.628
Do we have to listen to this?

34:07.713 --> 34:09.463
The man wants to talk.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.132
Thank you.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.552
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.887
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.931
He just isn't sure.

34:19.014 --> 34:21.851
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

34:21.935 --> 34:25.062
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.856
I respect his motives.

34:26.940 --> 34:31.485
The boy on trial is probably
guilty, but, uh, I want to hear more.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.362
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.697
I'm talking here! You have
no right to leave this room!

34:35.782 --> 34:37.658
He can't hear you. He never will.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.326
Let's sit down.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.708
Shall we continue?

34:45.792 --> 34:48.002
Well, I
- I think we ought to take a break.

34:48.085 --> 34:52.214
You know, one man's inside, and
I think we ought to wait for him.

34:52.299 --> 34:55.259
Okay.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.094
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

34:58.472 --> 35:00.806
And that thing with the old
man, that was pretty unexpected.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.352
I wish I could figure out
some way we could break it up.

35:08.482 --> 35:11.942
You know, in advertising
- I told you I worked in an agency.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.027
Mm-hmm.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.112
Well, there's some pretty
strange people working there.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.281
Well, they're not
strange really, I guess.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.992
It's just that they have peculiar
ways of expressing themselves.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.327
You know what I mean.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.621
Of course, I suppose it's the
same in your business too, huh?

35:24.372 --> 35:25.873
What do you do?

35:25.957 --> 35:28.125
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

35:28.210 --> 35:31.420
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

35:31.505 --> 35:34.507
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an
agency, when we reach a point like this -

35:34.591 --> 35:38.093
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

35:38.178 --> 35:40.805
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.848
And it kills me.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.433
It's the weirdest thing in the world...

35:44.518 --> 35:47.853
the way they sometimes precede their
idea with a little phrase, see, like -

35:47.938 --> 35:50.856
Some account exec will get
up, and he'll say, uh...

35:50.941 --> 35:52.775
"Okay, here's an idea.

35:52.859 --> 35:56.487
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it. "

35:56.571 --> 35:59.698
I mean, it's idiotic,
but it's funny, huh?

35:59.783 --> 36:04.286
I, uh - I got a little
excited back there. I -

36:05.288 --> 36:07.039
didn't mean to get nasty.

36:07.916 --> 36:11.710
I'm glad you're not one of those lets
these emotional appeals influence him.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.130
Uh -

36:28.395 --> 36:31.105
I don't know what's the matter with
that fan. Can't seem to get it to start.

36:32.482 --> 36:35.025
# Be, be, be #

36:35.110 --> 36:37.194
# Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum ##

36:37.779 --> 36:39.697
Eh!

36:40.824 --> 36:43.033
Hey, you a salesman?

36:43.118 --> 36:44.618
I'm an architect.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.787
Hmm.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.123
You know what the soft sell is?

36:52.043 --> 36:53.961
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.339
I got a different technique.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.925
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.261
Tricks. You know?

37:03.096 --> 37:04.305
Yeah.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.975
"Hit 'em where they
live. " That's my motto.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.146
I made 27 grand last
year sellin' marmalade.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.482
That's not bad. I mean, you
know, considering marmalade.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.487
Hey, what are you gettin' outta this
- kicks?

37:22.657 --> 37:25.242
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?

37:25.327 --> 37:27.036
Maybe.

37:28.038 --> 37:30.581
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.334
You're always blowing your
stacks over some guy that fanned.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.255
But what are you wasting our time for?

37:39.007 --> 37:43.052
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.599
This kid is guilty, pal.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.101
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.437
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

37:53.521 --> 37:56.440
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

37:56.524 --> 37:58.817
What difference does it make if
you get it here or at the ball game?

37:59.861 --> 38:02.780
Oh, no difference, pal.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.657
No difference at all.

38:06.826 --> 38:07.993
##

38:16.586 --> 38:18.462
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

38:18.546 --> 38:20.839
Oh, they're about the
same as anyone else.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.717
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.762
You think we'll be much longer?

38:26.846 --> 38:28.472
I don't know.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.474
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.101
Not a doubt in the whole world.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.728
We should
- Should've been done already.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.232
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.734
Hmm. Beats workin'.

38:44.406 --> 38:45.572
Uh -

38:47.951 --> 38:50.035
You think he's not guilty, huh?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.954
I don't know. It's possible.

38:52.706 --> 38:56.500
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.003
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.255
Supposing you were the
one who was on trial.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.966
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

39:04.050 --> 39:08.554
I'm just a workingman. My
boss does the supposing. But -

39:08.638 --> 39:10.139
Well, I'll try one.

39:11.349 --> 39:17.021
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

39:25.947 --> 39:27.239
Are you ready?

39:27.323 --> 39:28.532
Hup.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.533
That one.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.285
Sorry, blue eyes.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.622
- Well, where else - - Okay,
fellas, let's take our seats.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.624
Looks like we'll be
here for dinner, huh?

39:37.709 --> 39:40.085
Okay, now let's
- Let's get down to business.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.545
Now, who wants to start it off?

39:41.629 --> 39:43.047
- I would.
- Okay, go.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.215
You down there.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.178
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya. "

39:49.262 --> 39:51.889
A second later, he heard
the body hit the floor.

39:51.973 --> 39:55.851
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.311
What does that mean to you?

39:57.395 --> 40:00.773
I was wondering how clearly the old man could
have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.900
He didn't hear it through the
ceiling. The window was open.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.818
So was the one upstairs. It
was a hot night, remember?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.236
Well, it was another apartment.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.906
It's not that easy to identify a
voice, particularly a shouting voice.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.574
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.117
And don't forget the
lady across the street.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.995
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.539
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.583
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

40:19.667 --> 40:21.502
It's like talking into a dead phone.

40:21.586 --> 40:24.755
She said she saw the killing through
the windows of a moving elevated train.

40:24.839 --> 40:28.342
There were six cars on the train. She
saw the killing through the last two cars.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.260
She remembered the most
insignificant details.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.387
I don't see how you can argue with that.

40:32.472 --> 40:37.017
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el -

40:45.693 --> 40:47.277
Hey!

40:47.362 --> 40:48.862
This isn't a game.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.410
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

40:55.495 --> 40:57.246
- The nerve. -
All right, listen -

40:57.330 --> 41:00.582
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.626
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.

41:02.710 --> 41:06.046
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.466
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

41:09.551 --> 41:11.385
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

41:11.469 --> 41:13.345
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

41:13.429 --> 41:16.098
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

41:16.182 --> 41:18.058
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

41:19.060 --> 41:20.727
I think that's a pretty
good guess. Anyone else?

41:20.812 --> 41:23.605
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

41:23.690 --> 41:25.524
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.526
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

41:27.610 --> 41:32.656
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

41:32.740 --> 41:36.994
Now let's say the given point is the open
window of the room where the killing took place.

41:37.078 --> 41:40.372
You can reach out of that window and
almost touch the el tracks, right?

41:40.456 --> 41:41.957
Now let me ask you this.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.293
Has anyone here ever
lived near the el tracks?

41:44.377 --> 41:48.005
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.

41:48.089 --> 41:49.756
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

41:49.841 --> 41:51.008
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

41:51.092 --> 41:53.635
Oh, brother. Don't matter
though. We were all punchy.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.305
I lived in a second-floor
apartment near the el line once.

41:56.389 --> 41:59.433
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

41:59.559 --> 42:02.352
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
All right, you can't hear yourself think.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.855
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.567
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

42:08.651 --> 42:12.738
First. The old man in
the apartment downstairs.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.407
He says he heard the boy
say "I'm gonna kill you"...

42:15.491 --> 42:18.243
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

42:18.328 --> 42:19.912
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

42:19.996 --> 42:26.001
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

42:26.085 --> 42:29.421
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

42:29.505 --> 42:31.840
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

42:31.925 --> 42:33.258
Now, just a minute.

42:33.343 --> 42:37.763
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

42:38.598 --> 42:41.934
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

42:42.018 --> 42:46.980
we can assume that the body hit
the floor just as the train went by.

42:47.065 --> 42:51.526
Therefore, the train had been
roaring by the old man's window...

42:51.611 --> 42:55.113
a full 10 seconds before
the body hit the floor.

42:55.198 --> 42:57.407
The old man, according
to his own testimony -

42:57.492 --> 43:00.410
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later -

43:00.495 --> 43:02.955
would have had to hear the
boy make this statement...

43:03.039 --> 43:04.915
with the el roaring past his nose.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.541
It's not possible he could've heard it.

43:06.626 --> 43:08.794
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

43:08.878 --> 43:11.255
He said he yelled at the top of his
voice. That's good enough for me.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.590
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

43:13.675 --> 43:14.800
With the el roaring by?

43:14.884 --> 43:17.261
You're talking about a matter of
seconds! Nobody can be that accurate.

43:17.345 --> 43:21.974
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

43:24.185 --> 43:26.103
You know something? I don't
think he could've heard it.

43:26.187 --> 43:28.522
Maybe he didn't hear it. I
mean, with all that el noise.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.482
Oh, what are you people talking about?

43:30.566 --> 43:32.609
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

43:32.694 --> 43:34.611
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

43:34.696 --> 43:36.905
Attention maybe.

43:36.990 --> 43:38.907
You keep coming in with
these bright sayings!

43:38.992 --> 43:42.035
Why don't you send 'em in to a
paper? They pay three dollars apiece.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.329
What are you talking
to him like that for?

43:45.290 --> 43:48.709
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?

43:48.793 --> 43:50.627
You ought to have more respect, mister.

43:51.838 --> 43:56.216
If you say stuff like that to
him again, I'm gonna lay you out.

44:06.185 --> 44:09.146
Now you go ahead. You
- You say anything you like.

44:09.230 --> 44:13.275
Why do you think the old man might lie?

44:13.359 --> 44:16.778
It was just that I looked
at him for a very long time.

44:17.405 --> 44:20.657
The seams of his jacket was
split, under the shoulder.

44:20.742 --> 44:22.326
Or did you notice that?

44:22.410 --> 44:24.911
I mean, to come to court like that.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.663
Why -

44:27.790 --> 44:31.668
He was a very old man in a torn jacket.

44:31.753 --> 44:34.629
And he walked very slowly to the stand.

44:35.381 --> 44:39.426
He was dragging his left
leg and trying to hide it -

44:39.510 --> 44:41.178
because he was ashamed.

44:42.305 --> 44:45.724
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

44:46.601 --> 44:52.022
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who -

44:52.106 --> 44:54.483
who has been nothing all his life...

44:54.567 --> 44:56.985
who has never had recognition...

44:57.070 --> 44:59.154
or his name in the newspapers.

44:59.822 --> 45:02.032
Nobody knows him.

45:02.116 --> 45:04.159
Nobody quotes him.

45:04.243 --> 45:08.205
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.918
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing
- to be nothing.

45:13.628 --> 45:17.964
A man like this needs to be
quoted, to be listened to.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.550
To be quoted just once.

45:20.635 --> 45:22.511
Very important to him.

45:23.012 --> 45:25.430
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background -

45:25.515 --> 45:27.224
- Wait a minute. - When
there was a chance -

45:27.308 --> 45:30.185
What are you trying to do
- tell us he'd lie just so he could be important once?

45:30.269 --> 45:32.896
No. He wouldn't really lie.

45:32.980 --> 45:36.441
But perhaps he made himself
believe he heard those words...

45:36.526 --> 45:38.735
and recognized the boy's face.

45:38.820 --> 45:41.113
That's the most fantastic
story I've ever heard.

45:41.197 --> 45:44.241
How can you make up a thing like
that? What do you know about it?

45:53.292 --> 45:55.335
Oh, uh, does anybody want a cough drop?

45:55.420 --> 45:57.671
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

45:57.755 --> 46:01.258
You can say what you like. I still don't
see how anybody can think he's not guilty.

46:01.342 --> 46:03.844
There's something else I'd
like to talk about for a minute.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.554
Thanks.

46:05.638 --> 46:08.932
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you. "

46:09.016 --> 46:10.600
- But supposing - - You
didn't prove it at all.

46:10.685 --> 46:13.478
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

46:13.563 --> 46:15.981
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

46:16.065 --> 46:17.566
Probably thousands.

46:17.650 --> 46:19.276
"I could kill you for that, darling. "

46:19.360 --> 46:21.278
"Junior, you do that once
more, and I'm gonna kill you. "

46:21.362 --> 46:22.654
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him. "

46:22.738 --> 46:24.614
We say it every day. That doesn't
mean we're really gonna kill anybody.

46:24.699 --> 46:26.491
Wait a minute. What are
you trying to give us here?

46:26.576 --> 46:30.287
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you. "
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

46:30.371 --> 46:31.705
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.082
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

46:34.167 --> 46:35.625
Well, gee, now I don't know.

46:35.710 --> 46:40.422
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

46:40.506 --> 46:42.257
He called me an idiot,
so I yelled at him.

46:42.341 --> 46:45.302
Now listen! This guy's trying to make
you believe things that aren't so.

46:45.386 --> 46:47.471
The kid said he was gonna
kill him, and he did kill him.

46:47.555 --> 46:50.515
Let me ask you this. Do you really think
the boy would shout out a thing like that...

46:50.600 --> 46:52.392
so the whole neighborhood
could hear him?

46:52.477 --> 46:54.311
I don't think so. He's
much too bright for that.

46:54.395 --> 46:59.149
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

46:59.233 --> 47:02.068
"He doesn't even speak good English. "

47:04.530 --> 47:08.325
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to
change my vote to not guilty.

47:08.409 --> 47:09.826
You what?

47:09.911 --> 47:12.329
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.664
Yeah, I'm sure.

47:14.749 --> 47:17.209
The vote is nine to
three, favor of guilty.

47:17.293 --> 47:20.086
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?

47:24.133 --> 47:26.885
What are you basing it on
- the stories this guy made up?

47:27.512 --> 47:29.846
You ought to write for one of
those kooky detective magazines.

47:29.931 --> 47:31.765
You'd make a fortune.

47:31.849 --> 47:35.268
For crying out loud. The kid's own
lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.354
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

47:37.438 --> 47:39.231
You could see it.

47:39.315 --> 47:42.901
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

47:43.736 --> 47:45.529
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

47:45.613 --> 47:48.448
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

47:48.533 --> 47:51.368
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

47:51.452 --> 47:53.161
He was court-appointed.

47:53.246 --> 47:55.080
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

47:55.164 --> 47:58.416
It could mean he didn't want the
case, or he resented being appointed.

47:58.501 --> 48:00.335
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing -

48:00.419 --> 48:03.380
no money, no glory, not
even much chance of winning.

48:03.464 --> 48:06.383
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

48:06.467 --> 48:09.386
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

48:09.470 --> 48:11.471
and, as you pointed out a
minute ago, obviously he didn't.

48:11.556 --> 48:14.391
Of course he didn't. Huh.

48:14.475 --> 48:16.768
Who the heck could?

48:16.852 --> 48:19.771
Except maybe some guy's
mother or somebody. I -

48:19.855 --> 48:22.107
Ah, look. Will you
look at the time, huh?

48:22.191 --> 48:24.734
- Come on. For crying
out - - Pardon me.

48:24.819 --> 48:27.153
- I have made some
notes here - - Notes.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.864
and I would like to
- please, to say something.

48:29.949 --> 48:32.200
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

48:32.285 --> 48:36.705
And, uh, it seems to me that this
man has some very good points to make.

48:36.789 --> 48:41.418
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

48:41.502 --> 48:45.589
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

48:45.673 --> 48:47.966
There is a question I would like to ask.

48:48.050 --> 48:51.344
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

48:51.429 --> 48:54.764
Now, this happened at
10 minutes after 12:00.

48:54.849 --> 48:57.309
Now, how was he caught by the police?

48:57.393 --> 49:01.896
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...

49:01.981 --> 49:05.734
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

49:05.818 --> 49:10.405
Now, my question is, if he
really had killed his father...

49:10.489 --> 49:13.700
why would he come back
home three hours later?

49:13.784 --> 49:16.661
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

49:16.746 --> 49:18.496
He came home to get his knife.

49:18.581 --> 49:21.124
It's not nice to go around leaving
knives sticking in people's chests.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.960
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.296
I don't see anything funny about it.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.924
The boy knew the knife could be
identified as the one he had just bought.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.177
He had to get it before the police did.

49:32.261 --> 49:36.723
But if he knew the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it there in the first place?

49:37.266 --> 49:40.143
Well, I think we can assume the
boy ran out in a state of panic...

49:40.227 --> 49:42.604
after having just killed his father.

49:42.688 --> 49:45.649
When he finally calmed down, he
realized he had left his knife there.

49:45.733 --> 49:48.652
Ah. This then depends on
your definition of panic.

49:48.736 --> 49:51.112
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

49:51.197 --> 49:53.782
that there were no
fingerprints left on the knife.

49:53.866 --> 49:57.911
Now, where did this panic
start and where did it end?

49:57.995 --> 50:00.372
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

50:00.456 --> 50:04.000
I don't believe I have to be
loyal to one side or the other.

50:04.085 --> 50:05.877
I'm simply asking questions.

50:05.961 --> 50:08.963
Well, this is just off the
top of my head, but, uh...

50:09.048 --> 50:11.549
well, if I were the boy and I'd
done the stabbing and everything...

50:11.634 --> 50:13.760
I'd take a chance and
go back for the knife.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.346
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

50:16.430 --> 50:18.932
and that the body wouldn't be
discovered till the next day.

50:19.016 --> 50:21.059
Well, after all, it was
the middle of the night.

50:21.143 --> 50:23.645
I'll bet he'd figured nobody would
find the body till the next day.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.730
Pardon. This is my whole point.

50:25.815 --> 50:29.526
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing -

50:29.610 --> 50:32.195
that is, a moment after
the train went by...

50:32.279 --> 50:35.281
she screamed and then went
to telephone the police.

50:35.366 --> 50:38.743
Now, the boy certainly must
have heard the scream...

50:38.828 --> 50:42.330
so he knew that somebody saw something.

50:42.415 --> 50:45.208
I just don't think that
he would have gone back.

50:45.292 --> 50:48.044
Two things. One, in his state of
panic, he may not have heard the scream.

50:48.129 --> 50:49.796
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.258
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

50:53.342 --> 50:56.386
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.930
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

50:59.014 --> 51:01.891
Maybe the boy did kill his
father, didn't hear the scream...

51:01.976 --> 51:05.687
did run out in a panic, did
calm down three hours later...

51:05.771 --> 51:08.398
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

51:08.482 --> 51:11.401
Maybe all of those things
happened, but maybe they didn't.

51:11.485 --> 51:14.237
I think there's enough doubt that we
can wonder whether he was there at all...

51:14.321 --> 51:15.989
during the time the killing took place.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.824
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

51:17.908 --> 51:19.617
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

51:19.702 --> 51:21.494
He's twisting the
facts, I'm telling you.

51:21.579 --> 51:24.914
Did or didn't the old man see the
kid running out of the house at 12:10?

51:24.999 --> 51:26.916
Well, did or didn't he?

51:27.001 --> 51:30.211
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

51:30.296 --> 51:33.256
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.592
Or when he wants them to,
they do. You know what I mean?

51:35.676 --> 51:37.510
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

51:37.595 --> 51:39.304
Maybe what we need is a
little yelling in here.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.097
These guys keep going
off every which way.

51:41.182 --> 51:43.099
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

51:43.184 --> 51:46.352
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.938
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here -

51:49.023 --> 51:51.399
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

51:51.484 --> 51:55.153
There's another vote called
for. Now let's take our seats.

51:59.033 --> 52:01.576
I never saw so much
time spent on nothing.

52:01.660 --> 52:03.369
It only takes a second.

52:04.455 --> 52:07.874
Okay. I guess the fastest way is
to find out who's voting not guilty.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.710
Now, all those voting not
guilty, please raise your hands.

52:11.962 --> 52:15.548
Still the same. One, two,
three not guilty. Nine guilty.

52:15.633 --> 52:17.300
So, now where are we?

52:17.384 --> 52:20.804
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

52:20.888 --> 52:23.640
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

52:23.724 --> 52:26.726
Oh!

52:26.811 --> 52:30.104
What are ya talking about? I mean, we're
all going crazy in here or something.

52:30.189 --> 52:33.983
The kid is guilty. Why don't
you listen to the facts?

52:34.068 --> 52:36.319
Tell him, will ya? Now this
is getting to be a joke.

52:36.403 --> 52:39.614
The vote is eight to
four, favor of guilty.

52:39.698 --> 52:43.368
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

52:43.452 --> 52:45.954
I want you to get up and tell
me why you changed your vote.

52:46.038 --> 52:50.333
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.168
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

52:52.253 --> 52:55.255
What reasonable doubt? That's
nothing but words. Here, look at this.

52:55.339 --> 53:00.260
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.345
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

53:02.429 --> 53:05.098
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

53:05.182 --> 53:07.350
Oh, brilliant.

53:07.434 --> 53:09.727
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.

53:09.812 --> 53:11.980
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?

53:12.064 --> 53:14.899
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're
pulling stories out of thin air, you know?

53:14.984 --> 53:18.695
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

53:18.779 --> 53:21.239
he'd be trying to tell you that, uh -

53:21.323 --> 53:23.700
Look. Now, what about the old man?

53:23.784 --> 53:26.369
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

53:26.453 --> 53:29.455
and see the kid tearing down the
steps 15 seconds after the killing?

53:29.540 --> 53:32.000
He's just saying so
to be important, right?

53:32.084 --> 53:34.878
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?

53:34.962 --> 53:37.171
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

53:37.256 --> 53:39.215
and pop-ups are fallin' for
base hits wherever we look.

53:39.300 --> 53:42.552
Hold it a second. Now, look
- Did the old man say he ran to the door?

53:42.636 --> 53:45.597
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got
on, didn't he? I mean, he got there, didn't he?

53:45.681 --> 53:48.224
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

53:48.309 --> 53:51.728
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

53:51.812 --> 53:54.188
Î—e said he went from his
bedroom to the front door.

53:54.273 --> 53:55.899
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

53:55.983 --> 53:58.234
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

53:58.319 --> 54:00.570
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.864
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

54:02.990 --> 54:06.200
- Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all over again so you can get everything straight?
- Mr. Foreman.

54:06.285 --> 54:08.912
How come you're the only one in this
room wants to see exhibits all the time?

54:08.996 --> 54:11.706
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

54:11.790 --> 54:14.626
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found -

54:14.710 --> 54:16.669
We're not, not unless
somebody else wants to.

54:16.754 --> 54:18.463
But I'd like to find
out if an old man...

54:18.547 --> 54:20.924
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

54:21.008 --> 54:23.426
can get from his bedroom to
his front door in 15 seconds.

54:23.510 --> 54:25.178
- He said 20 seconds.
- Î—e said 15.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.430
He said 20 seconds. What
are you trying to distort -

54:27.514 --> 54:30.767
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

54:30.851 --> 54:32.518
You can't judge a thing like that.

54:32.603 --> 54:34.979
He said 15 seconds. He
was very positive about it.

54:35.064 --> 54:37.273
He was an old man. Half
the time he was confused.

54:37.358 --> 54:39.651
How could he be positive about anything?

54:47.326 --> 54:51.454
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

54:51.538 --> 54:53.706
Well, let's see if the
details bear him out.

54:53.791 --> 54:56.668
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

54:56.752 --> 54:58.419
running toward the front door...

54:58.504 --> 55:01.589
heard the upstairs door open, the
footsteps start down the stairs.

55:01.674 --> 55:03.800
He said he got to his own front
door as fast as he could...

55:03.884 --> 55:05.969
and he swore it couldn't have
been more than 15 seconds.

55:06.053 --> 55:07.720
Now, if the killer began
running immediately -

55:07.805 --> 55:10.014
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

55:10.099 --> 55:12.809
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

55:14.103 --> 55:16.229
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

55:16.313 --> 55:19.440
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

55:19.525 --> 55:21.234
Now that you've got that
thing in here, what about it?

55:21.318 --> 55:23.486
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

55:23.570 --> 55:26.614
The old man's apartment was directly
beneath and exactly the same.

55:26.699 --> 55:29.909
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

55:29.994 --> 55:31.995
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.

55:32.079 --> 55:34.330
Now, the old man was in
this bedroom right here.

55:34.415 --> 55:37.083
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

55:37.167 --> 55:40.128
opened the front door just in time to
see the boy running down the stairs.

55:40.212 --> 55:43.548
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

55:43.632 --> 55:47.176
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

55:47.261 --> 55:49.303
Now, let's see. It was -

55:49.388 --> 55:53.391
It's 12 feet from the bed to
the door. The hall is 43 feet.

55:53.475 --> 55:56.686
He would have had to walk 12
feet, open the bedroom door...

55:56.770 --> 56:00.398
walk 43 feet down and open the
front door all in 15 seconds.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.192
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

56:03.277 --> 56:05.862
He can walk only very slowly. They
had to help him into the witness chair.

56:05.946 --> 56:07.613
You make it sound like a long walk.

56:07.698 --> 56:10.033
For an old man who had a
stroke, it is a long walk.

56:10.117 --> 56:13.536
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.

56:13.662 --> 56:16.998
What do you mean, you want to try it? Why didn't
his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?

56:17.124 --> 56:20.752
- Maybe he just didn't think about it, huh?
- What do you mean, didn't think of it? You think the man's an idiot or something?

56:20.836 --> 56:22.378
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

56:22.463 --> 56:24.130
Listen, smart guy. Don't
matter whether I thought of it.

56:24.214 --> 56:26.424
He didn't bring it up because he knew it
would hurt his case. What do you think of that?

56:26.550 --> 56:30.386
Maybe he didn't bring it up because it would have
meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man.

56:30.471 --> 56:33.806
You know that doesn't sit very well with
a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

56:33.891 --> 56:36.601
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

56:36.685 --> 56:39.729
Pass me that chair, will you? Those
two chairs are the old man's bed.

56:39.813 --> 56:42.690
I just paced off 12 feet across the
room. This will be the bedroom door.

56:42.775 --> 56:45.401
Oh, that's crazy. You can't
recreate a thing like that.

56:45.486 --> 56:47.695
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

56:47.780 --> 56:49.781
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

56:51.075 --> 56:54.911
Look, this is absolutely insane. What are
you wasting everybody's time in here for?

56:54.995 --> 56:57.872
According to you, it'll only take 15
seconds. Now, we can spare that, see.

57:01.835 --> 57:03.503
Come on. Knock it off.

57:03.587 --> 57:05.088
Okay.

57:05.172 --> 57:07.215
Okay. Okay, killer.

57:07.299 --> 57:08.883
Yeah.

57:11.220 --> 57:13.262
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

57:13.347 --> 57:15.848
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

57:15.933 --> 57:18.101
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

57:18.185 --> 57:20.603
When you want me to start, stamp your
foot. That'll be the body falling.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.605
You can time me from there.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.774
What are we gonna do, play charades now?

57:24.858 --> 57:26.901
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

57:26.985 --> 57:28.903
Well, I want to wait till
the second hand reaches 60.

57:28.987 --> 57:30.905
Oh, come on.

57:37.621 --> 57:40.623
Come on. Speed it up. He could
walk twice as fast as that.

57:42.084 --> 57:44.544
You want me to walk
faster than that, I will.

58:01.436 --> 58:03.896
Lock. Door. Stop.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.982
- Right.
- What's the time?

58:06.066 --> 58:09.318
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.

58:09.403 --> 58:11.654
This is what I think happened.

58:11.738 --> 58:14.574
The old man heard the fight between the
boy and his father a few hours earlier.

58:14.658 --> 58:17.493
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

58:17.578 --> 58:21.080
heard the woman scream from across the street,
got to his front door as fast as he could...

58:21.165 --> 58:23.749
heard somebody racing down the
stairs and assumed it was the boy.

58:23.834 --> 58:25.668
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

58:25.752 --> 58:28.254
Oh.

58:28.338 --> 58:34.302
Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty in
my day, but this little display takes the cake.

58:34.386 --> 58:39.098
You all come in here with your hearts bleeding
all over the floor about slum kids and injustice.

58:39.183 --> 58:41.184
You listen to some fairy tales.

58:41.268 --> 58:43.561
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

58:43.645 --> 58:46.606
Well, you're not getting
through to me. I've had enough.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.733
What's the matter with you guys?

58:48.817 --> 58:51.527
You all know he's
guilty! He's got to burn!

58:51.612 --> 58:53.404
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

58:53.488 --> 58:55.698
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?

58:55.782 --> 58:57.450
I'm one of 'em!

58:58.619 --> 59:00.453
Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.538
For this kid, you bet I would.

59:02.623 --> 59:05.875
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.

59:06.752 --> 59:10.671
Ever since you walked into this room, you've
been acting like a self-appointed public avenger.

59:10.756 --> 59:15.051
You want to see this boy die because you
personally want it, not because of the facts.

59:15.135 --> 59:17.303
- You're a
sadist. - You -

59:17.387 --> 59:21.224
Let me go! I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

59:21.308 --> 59:23.726
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

59:31.026 --> 59:33.361
Is there anything wrong,
gentlemen? I heard some noise.

59:33.445 --> 59:37.448
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just
- You know, friendly little argument. It's -

59:37.532 --> 59:40.826
Um, listen, we're through with that
diagram. You can take it if you want.

59:42.204 --> 59:43.871
Here you are. Thank you.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.504
What are you lookin' at?

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:14.318
I suppose somebody has
to start it off again.

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:18.114
- I beg pardon.
- "I beg pardon. " What are you so polite about?

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:20.283
For the same reason you're not.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.368
It's the way I was brought up.

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.205
This fighting -

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.332
That's not why we are here, to fight.

01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:30.793
We have a responsibility.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:36.549
This, I have always thought, is a
remarkable thing about democracy...

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.509
that we are -

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.305
Uh, what is the word?

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:45.474
Notified. That we are
notified by mail...

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:49.895
to come down to this place to
decide on the guilt or innocence...

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.025
of a man we have never heard of before.

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:58.654
We have nothing to gain or lose by
- by our verdict.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:02.700
This is one of the
reasons why we are strong.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.829
We should not make it a personal thing.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.832
Thank you.

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:13.336
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.172
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:17.882
and see if the cat licks it up.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:20.301
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy -

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.932
Look how dark it's getting out there.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.477
I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.731
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:38.027
Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:41.614
No, I don't.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.699
Well, listen. I, uh -

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:46.952
I was wondering if, uh, maybe -

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.330
maybe we should take another vote.

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:53.709
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:55.586
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.924
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:03.219
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:06.806
I think we ought to have an open ballot
- call out our votes, you know.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.100
Let's see who stands where.

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.685
That sounds fair to me. Anyone object?

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:17.149
Okay. I'll call off
your jury numbers. One.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.945
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:22.822
Two?

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.407
Not guilty.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.785
- Number three?
- Guilty.

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:30.329
Number four?

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:33.624
Guilty.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.460
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

01:02:37.546 --> 01:02:40.840
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:43.509
Number seven?

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.302
Guilty.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.430
Number eight?

01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:49.181
Not guilty.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:53.436
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.688
- Number 10?
- Guilty.

01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:59.525
Number 11?

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.444
Not guilty.

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.028
Number 12?

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.282
Number 12.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:07.867
Guilty.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.875
The vote is now six to six.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:19.128
Yeah, right. And we go into
extra innings here, huh?

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:26.051
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.970
A kid like that.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:31.307
I don't think the kind of boy
he is has anything to do with it.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:33.476
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.728
Don't give me that! I'm
sick and tired of facts!

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.813
You can twist them any way
you like. You know what I mean?

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:40.483
That's exactly the point this
gentleman has been making.

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:43.486
- Oh!
- I mean, you keep shouting at the top of your lungs.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:47.072
I'd like to be a few years younger.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.074
That man gets on my -

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:55.289
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:59.084
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:08.719
It's gonna rain.

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:11.055
Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:14.183
How come you changed your vote?

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:16.685
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.979
You haven't got a leg to stand
on. You know that, I hope.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:22.066
I don't feel that way. There were a
lot of details that never came out.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.694
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.988
You think too much. You get mixed up.

01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:33.202
- You know what I mean? - Now, listen.
I don't think you have any right -

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:35.871
Loudmouth.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:31.093
Look at that come down, will you?

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:34.138
You know...

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:36.724
this reminds me of
a storm we had last -

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:40.269
Oh, when was that? November -

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.439
I don't know. Something. It
was quite a storm we had there.

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:45.899
It was right in the middle of a game.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.611
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.280
but we just started to move
the ball, right off the tackle.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:54.158
Started cutting right
- slash here and slash right in...

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:56.035
cut right through.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.621
And, uh -

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.914
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:05.461
A real
- He was an ox. You know, a real ox.

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:08.047
I wish I had another one just like him.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:12.635
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:14.803
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.640
And, uh, anyway...

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.808
we're starting to move along real nice.

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:23.062
Their whole line is just
- they're just coming apart.

01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:28.108
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:30.819
Just whoosh
- you know, right down.

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:35.491
Well, that was murder, you know?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:38.160
I swear, I
- I nearly bawled.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.579
You just
- You couldn't go nowhere.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.165
Well.

01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:01.308
Hey, what is it with
this fan here? How come -

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.818
Hey! Î—uh?

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:14.196
Must have been on the same
switch with the lights.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:18.367
Well, things are looking up here, huh?

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:20.536
Yeah, huh?

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.376
Boy. That's better.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.551
Hey!

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.302
Two points.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.308
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:48.480
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.733
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh -

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:53.152
You know?

01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:56.363
Pardon me.

01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:59.783
Well, how do you like it? Even Steven.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:02.244
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:03.829
Yes.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:09.126
Say, that business before, when
that tall guy - what's-his-name -

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:11.920
was trying to bait me
- That doesn't prove anything.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.590
I'm a pretty excitable person.

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:18.510
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:22.096
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:24.475
He was just trying to bait me.

01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:26.560
He did an excellent job.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.564
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:34.193
I'm ready to walk into court
right now and declare a hung jury.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:36.111
There's no point in this
thing going on anymore.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:37.529
Yeah. I go for that too.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.448
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:43.368
I don't think the judge will accept a hung
jury. We haven't been in here very long.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.120
Well, let's find out.

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:46.913
I'm not in favor of that.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:50.209
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:53.127
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.421
You still don't think there's
room for reasonable doubt?

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:56.799
No, I don't.

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.175
Pardon.

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:01.511
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt. "

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.139
What do you mean I don't understand?

01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:07.184
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:08.935
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.854
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.316
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.193
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:20.863
Hey, all right. Let's stop the
arguing for about two minutes in here.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:23.325
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:26.953
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.706
An important point for the
prosecution was the fact...

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.542
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.627
during the hours that
the killing took place...

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:38.590
couldn't remember the names of the
movies or the stars who appeared in them.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.176
This gentleman here has put up
that point in here several times.

01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:42.719
That's correct.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.680
It was the only alibi the boy offered...

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.265
and he himself couldn't back
it up with any details at all.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.602
Putting yourself in the boy's place, do
you think you could remember details...

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:54.147
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:57.442
I think so, if there were any
special details to remember.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:00.696
The boy couldn't remember the names of the
movies he saw because be wasn't there that night.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.823
According to the police
testimony in court...

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:06.034
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:09.037
while the body of his father was
lying on the floor in the bedroom.

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.707
Do you think you could remember
details under those circumstances?

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.792
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:16.378
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.422
He named the pictures and
the stars who played in them.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:21.675
Yes. His lawyer took great
pains to bring that out.

01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:24.303
He had three months from the night of
the murder to the day of the trial...

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.013
in which to memorize them.

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:28.765
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find
out what played at a particular theater...

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.517
on a particular night.

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:34.229
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who
interrogated the boy right after the murder...

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:36.732
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.734
great emotional stress or not.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:42.112
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:45.449
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:48.076
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.494
No, it's all right.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:52.122
I left the office at 8:30 and
went straight home and to bed.

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:53.874
And the night before that?

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.376
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.462
The night of the bridge
tournament. I played bridge.

01:10:58.546 --> 01:10:59.880
Monday night?

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.175
When you get down to New Year's
Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.137
Monday night?

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:11.391
Monday night, uh, my wife
and I went to the movies.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.101
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:16.438
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:19.149
The, um -

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.902
I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh -

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:26.156
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something -

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.700
The -

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.453
Mrs. Bainbridge. The
Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:34.289
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.960
Uh,yes. The Amazing Mrs.
Bainbridge. I think that's right.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.545
Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:44.299
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:46.385
A dark, very pretty girl.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.222
Ling or Long
- something like that.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:53.517
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:58.021
It was a very inexpensive second
feature with, uh, unknown -

01:11:58.106 --> 01:12:01.233
And you weren't under an
emotional stress, were you?

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:06.279
No.

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:08.031
I wasn't.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:11.660
I think the point is made.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.496
Big point!

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.748
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.919
The boy is guilty, period. You
know what I mean, my friend?

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:24.256
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.510
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.971
There goes your ball game.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.473
It's only a shower.

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.726
Besides, they got the infield covered.

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:38.979
Right. Say, could I see
that knife a second, please?

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:44.109
Well, we're still tied up six to six.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.194
Who's got a suggestion?

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.280
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.824
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:53.035
Okay with me.

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.287
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.915
I mean, it's been bothering me a
little, and as long as we're stuck.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.878
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made -

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.588
the downward angle of it, you know?

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.673
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:08.383
They've been over it and over it.

01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:10.761
Well, I know they did, but
I don't go along with it.

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:14.848
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7
inches tall. His father was 6'2".

01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:17.100
That's a difference of seven inches.

01:13:17.185 --> 01:13:19.853
It's a very awkward thing to stab
down into the chest of someone...

01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:21.938
who's more than half a
foot taller than you are.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.149
Give me that.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:27.027
I'll give you a
demonstration. Somebody get up.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.322
You -

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:37.537
I want you to watch this 'cause I
don't want to have to do it again.

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:40.373
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.585
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:53.804
That's not funny.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:59.726
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:02.187
Right. Nobody hurt.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:10.445
Now, this is the way I'd stab
a man who was taller than I was.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.989
Look at the angle
- down and in.

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:15.158
And this is the way it was done.

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:17.410
Now tell me I'm wrong.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:23.041
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.960
Can you give me that?

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.879
Boy, I hate these things.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.631
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.299
- You?
- No.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:34.177
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:37.055
Well, I have. You know,
on my back stoop...

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.474
the lot across the street, backyard.

01:14:39.559 --> 01:14:41.977
Switchblades came with the
neighborhood where I lived.

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:45.313
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:48.775
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.821
See, you use too much
time switching hands.

01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:57.075
Here's how
- underhanded.

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:02.831
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:05.542
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:07.460
That's why they're
made to open like that.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:10.172
- You'd say the boy was pretty
handy with a knife? - Mm-hmm.

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:13.425
You think he could have made the
kind of wound that killed his father?

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:17.429
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.514
I feel he'd have gone
for him underhanded.

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:22.642
How do you know? Were you in the
room when the father was killed?

01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:24.728
No. Neither was anybody else.

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:28.023
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:31.359
I don't think you can determine what type of
wound the boy might or might not have made...

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:34.070
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:36.489
What do you think?

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:38.658
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.577
I don't know.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.791
How about you?

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:50.629
I don't know about the rest of them, but I'm getting
a little tired of this yackety-yackin' back and forth.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:54.174
It's gettin' us nowhere. So I
guess I'll have to break it up.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.801
I change my vote to not guilty.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:00.222
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:02.766
What do you mean you've had
enough? That's no answer!

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:06.811
Hey, listen. You just take
care of yourself, huh? You know?

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:10.857
He's right. That's not an answer.

01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:13.902
What kind of a man are you?

01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:17.113
You have sat here and voted
guilty with everyone else...

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:21.451
because there are some baseball
tickets burning a hole in your pocket.

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:25.789
And now you've changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking here?

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.250
Now listen, buddy!

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:33.004
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.590
- Don't you care -
- Now wait a minute!

01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:39.678
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.638
If you want to vote not guilty...

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:44.099
then do it because you are
convinced the man is not guilty...

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.976
not because you've had enough.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.645
And if you think he is
guilty, then vote that way.

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:51.940
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:54.276
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:58.655
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:01.950
Look, I don't have to -

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:05.161
You do have to! Say it! Why?

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:07.706
All right. I don't,
uh, think he's guilty.

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:18.842
I want another vote.

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:21.428
Okay. There's another vote called for.

01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:24.389
I guess the quickest way is a
show of hands. Anyone object?

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.392
Okay. All those voting not
guilty, raise your hands.

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:33.481
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:37.986
eight.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:44.034
Um, nine.

01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:50.040
Um, all those voting
guilty, raise your hands.

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:52.500
One, two, three.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.086
Well, the vote's nine to
three in favor of acquittal.

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:58.256
I don't understand you people!

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.508
I mean, all these picky little
points you keep bringing up.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:03.928
They don't mean nothing! You
saw this kid just like I did.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:07.515
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.601
and that business about
being at the movies.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:12.687
Look, you know how these
people lie. It's born in them.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.814
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.858
They don't know what the truth is.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:20.653
And let me tell you, they don't need any
real big reason to kill someone either.

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:22.489
No, sir.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:25.617
They get drunk! Oh, they're
real big drinkers, all of 'em.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.870
You know that. And bang
- someone's lying in the gutter.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:31.956
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.125
You know what I mean? Violent!

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.710
Where are you going?

01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:38.797
Î—uman life don't mean as
much to them as it does to us.

01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:42.801
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:44.886
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.346
They don't care!

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:48.640
Oh, sure, there's some
good things about 'em too.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.683
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:54.062
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:57.899
Most of 'em, it's like they have
no feelings. They can do anything.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.568
What's going on here?

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.695
I'm
- I'm trying to tell ya...

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.781
you're making a big mistake, you people.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:07.867
This kid is a liar! I know
it. I know all about them.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.746
Listen to me. They're no good.

01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:14.165
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:18.670
I mean, what
- What's happening in here?

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:21.005
I'm speaking my piece, and you -

01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:23.883
Listen to me.

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:26.428
I -

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:28.972
We're - This kid on
trial here, his type -

01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:31.057
Well, don't you know about them?

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:36.479
Th-There's - There's
a danger here.

01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.648
These people are dangerous.

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:41.776
They're... wild.

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.778
Listen to me.

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:46.197
- Listen.
- I have.

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.284
Now sit down and don't
open your mouth again.

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:55.957
I was only trying to... tell you.

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:36.748
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:41.878
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.840
I don't really know what the truth is.

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:48.843
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:54.098
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:57.185
But we're just gambling
on probabilities.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.229
We may be wrong.

01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:01.689
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.233
I don't know.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:05.318
Nobody really can.

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:07.779
But we have a reasonable doubt...

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:11.366
and that's something that's
very valuable in our system.

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:15.995
No jury can declare a man
guilty unless it's sure.

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:19.832
We nine can't understand...

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.627
how you three are still so sure.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.463
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.343
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.136
and I have two reasons.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:35.348
One, the evidence given by
the woman across the street...

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:38.059
who actually saw the murder committed.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.728
As far as I'm concerned, that's
the most important testimony.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:44.065
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:49.779
she saw the boy raise his arm over his
head and stab down into the father's chest.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:51.906
She saw him do it the wrong way.

01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:53.908
That's absolutely right.

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:56.578
Let's talk about this
woman for a moment.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:59.747
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:03.418
Her bed was next to the window, and
she could look out while lying down...

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:07.589
and see directly into the
boy's room across the street.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:10.300
She tossed and turned for
over an hour, unable to sleep.

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:14.554
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:19.767
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:22.562
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:27.442
but that she got a good look at the
boy in the act of stabbing his father.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:32.280
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

01:22:33.032 --> 01:22:35.700
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:42.749
How about you?

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:46.836
I
- I don't know.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.921
So much evidence to sift.

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:50.965
This is a pretty complicated business.

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:54.844
Frankly, I don't see how
you can vote for acquittal.

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:57.263
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

01:22:57.348 --> 01:22:59.390
You can throw out all
the other evidence!

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:03.061
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:05.021
- Yeah, well, maybe
- - Let's vote on it.

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:07.273
Okay. There's another vote called for.

01:23:07.358 --> 01:23:09.192
Anybody object?

01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:12.320
All right. I'm changing
my vote. He's guilty.

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:14.822
Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.

01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:18.493
Why is this such a personal triumph for you
- this one vote?

01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:22.038
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.832
Î—ow about it? I want to hear arguments.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.418
You, you're the leader of
the cause. What about it?

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:31.506
Let's go over it again.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.508
We've been over it again!

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:38.388
The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin'
backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:42.308
No point in getting nasty and
trying to turn this into a contest.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:45.728
Okay.

01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:48.856
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.067
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:55.530
It's a quarter after 6:00.

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:57.573
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

01:23:57.658 --> 01:24:00.034
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:03.371
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:05.123
Don't you feel well?

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:08.418
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:11.212
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:14.215
Uh, the reason I asked
about that was because, uh...

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:15.883
you were rubbing your nose like -

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:18.636
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:21.931
but you made a gesture that
reminded me of something.

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.058
I'm trying to settle
something here. Do you mind?

01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:26.144
Well, I think this is important.

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:29.021
Thank you.

01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:31.733
Now then, I'm sure you'll
pardon me for this...

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.736
but I was wondering why you
were rubbing your nose like that.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.487
Oh, come on, will ya?

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:40.742
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:44.078
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:48.249
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:49.959
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:53.921
- Is it - Is it because of
your eyeglasses? - It is.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:55.757
Now can we get on to something else?

01:24:55.841 --> 01:25:00.428
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.680
I hadn't noticed that before.

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:06.267
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.269
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:11.689
I've never worn
eyeglasses. Twenty-twenty.

01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:14.317
Listen, will you come on
already with the optometrist bit?

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:19.781
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:23.409
had those same marks on
the sides of her nose.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.621
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:28.372
Please.

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:32.210
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:35.129
I don't know if anyone
else noticed that about her.

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:39.091
I didn't think of it then, but
I've been going over her face...

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.261
in my mind.

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:44.347
She had those same marks.

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:49.519
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:55.233
This woman was about, uh
- about 45 years old.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:59.278
She was making a tremendous
effort to look 35...

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:01.572
for her first public appearance.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:04.909
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:08.871
brand-new clothes that should
have been worn by a younger woman.

01:26:08.956 --> 01:26:10.623
No glasses.

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:12.375
No, women do that.

01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:14.877
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:16.796
What do you mean, no glasses?

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.590
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:21.884
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.

01:26:21.969 --> 01:26:23.886
So what? What do ya think that means?

01:26:23.971 --> 01:26:27.181
- Listen, I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.

01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:30.268
Hey, listen. Listen, he's
right. I saw them too.

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:33.479
I was the closest one to her. She had these, uh
- these things on the side of her nose.

01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:36.774
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:40.736
She had dyed hair, marks on her
nose. Well, what does that mean?

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:45.116
Could those marks be made by
anything other than eyeglasses?

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:51.038
No, they couldn't.

01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:53.124
I didn't see any marks!

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:56.460
I did.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:59.088
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:01.299
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:04.302
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.470
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:09.724
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:11.684
Have her testify without her glasses?

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:15.730
Did you ever see a woman who had to wear glasses and
didn't want to because she thinks they spoil her looks?

01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:19.317
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:23.070
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:27.325
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the
house so people would think she's gorgeous.

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:31.996
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.290
That's all.

01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:38.377
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:42.006
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.092
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:46.928
tossing and turning,
trying to fall asleep.

01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.347
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:51.891
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

01:27:51.975 --> 01:27:54.101
when she turned to look
casually out of the window.

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.938
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

01:27:57.022 --> 01:28:00.066
The lights went off a split second later. She
couldn't have had time to put them on then.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.776
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:05.947
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:09.617
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:12.453
How do you know what kind of glasses
she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:15.164
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

01:28:15.248 --> 01:28:18.501
I only know the woman's
eyesight is in question now.

01:28:18.585 --> 01:28:24.715
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.176
You can't send someone off
to die on evidence like that.

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.261
Oh, don't give me that.

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:31.514
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:34.016
- No.
- It's not possible?

01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:35.726
No, it's not possible.

01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:40.606
Is it possible?

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.401
Not guilty.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:50.241
Do you think he's guilty?

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:52.326
I think he's guilty.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.747
Do you?

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:02.670
No. I'm convinced.

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:04.338
Not guilty.

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:06.215
What's the matter with you?

01:29:06.299 --> 01:29:08.217
I have a reasonable doubt now.

01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:09.844
Eleven to one.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:12.847
Well, what about all the other
evidence? What about all that stuff?

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:15.016
The knife, the whole business!

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:18.019
Well, you said we could throw
out all the other evidence.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:25.943
Well, what do we do now?

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:30.614
You're alone.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.535
I don't care whether I'm
alone or not! It's my right.

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:39.874
It's your right.

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:51.427
Well, what do you
want? I say he's guilty.

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:56.390
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.518
We're not convinced.

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:02.396
We want to hear them again.

01:30:02.481 --> 01:30:04.482
We have as much time as it takes.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:14.617
Everything - Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom -

01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:16.619
but I mean everything
- says he's guilty.

01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:19.163
What do you think, I'm
an idiot or something?

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:22.917
Why don't you take that
stuff about the old man?

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:26.170
The old man who lived
there and heard everything.

01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:29.507
Or this business about the knife.

01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:31.592
What? 'Cause he found
another one exactly like it?

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:35.012
The old man saw him
right there on the stairs!

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:37.932
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:41.102
Every single thing.

01:30:42.521 --> 01:30:45.689
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:49.110
You can't prove he
didn't get to the door.

01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:51.612
Sure, you can take all the
time, hobble around the room.

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:54.281
But you can't prove it!

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:59.829
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:02.957
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:07.253
I'll bet ya $5,000 I'd
remember the movies I saw.

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:09.588
I'm telling ya, everything
that's gone on...

01:31:09.673 --> 01:31:13.509
has been twisted and turned!

01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:15.678
This business with the glasses?

01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:21.308
How do you know she didn't have them
on? This woman testified in open court!

01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:25.354
And what about hearing
the kid yell, huh?

01:31:25.438 --> 01:31:28.691
I'm telling ya, I've
got all the facts here.

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.735
Here. Ah -

01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:36.615
Well, that's it! That's the whole case.

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:45.416
Well?

01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:49.712
Say something!

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:58.429
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:01.015
You're not gonna intimidate me.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:03.601
I'm entitled to my opinion.

01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:11.275
Rotten kids. You work your life out!

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:18.073
I can't keep -

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:24.413
No.

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:30.127
Not guilty.

01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:35.174
Not guilty.

01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:39.803
Not -

01:32:50.357 --> 01:32:52.524
Um, we're ready now.

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:47.848
Hey!

01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:53.854
What's your name?

01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:55.439
Davis.

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:57.441
My name's McCardle.

01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:01.445
Well, so long.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.030
So long.
