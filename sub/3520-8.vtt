WEBVTT

00:34.119 --> 00:35.954
Your breath is terrible.

00:39.499 --> 00:42.627
- Go back to sleep.
- Oh, my God.

00:42.794 --> 00:44.129
Go back to sleep.

01:04.816 --> 01:06.651
All right.

01:12.157 --> 01:13.283
Okay.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.876
Hey.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.003
Wake up, sleepy--

01:25.170 --> 01:27.213
Shit! Oh, my God!

01:27.380 --> 01:29.924
Ow. Just--
just go back to bed.

01:30.008 --> 01:31.301
Is it another earthquake?

01:31.384 --> 01:33.178
No, me and my
stupid butterfingers.

01:35.180 --> 01:36.848
Are you making me breakfast
in bed, Patrick Murray?

01:37.015 --> 01:38.850
Yeah,
I was trying to, yeah.

01:39.184 --> 01:40.685
Just leave it.
Don't cut yourself.

01:40.852 --> 01:43.354
I even made a special
trip to get goji berries.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.315
Patrick, please come on.
We'll tidy that up later.

01:45.482 --> 01:46.733
Just come back to bed.

01:46.900 --> 01:50.195
Okay. Oh, God.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.654
That's so sweet.

01:53.198 --> 01:54.949
Oh, God. I got granola
on my feet.

01:57.535 --> 02:00.872
Don't need breakfast in bed.
You in bed is enough.

02:05.210 --> 02:06.544
- Minty fresh.
- Of course.

02:09.214 --> 02:12.217
You're really
excited about tomorrow.

02:12.383 --> 02:15.053
I am. I am.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.554
Do you think that
that fantasy bisexual

02:16.721 --> 02:18.765
goth princess from Austin
will be there?

02:18.932 --> 02:21.017
She's at every GaymerX, and she
always has the coolest stuff.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.435
- Does she?
- Yeah, the best.

02:22.602 --> 02:24.854
But will she have otters
battling banjee boys?

02:24.979 --> 02:27.565
- That's the thing.
- I hope not.

02:27.732 --> 02:29.818
- Well, if she does, we're screwed.
- No, are you kidding?

02:29.901 --> 02:31.694
We're so going to be
the hit of the conference.

02:31.778 --> 02:33.279
- You think so?
- Yeah.

02:33.446 --> 02:35.240
We're taking gay-related
apps to the next level.

02:35.406 --> 02:36.908
I'm seeing like the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine.

02:37.075 --> 02:40.411
That's if it actually works.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.539
I don't even think it can
stand alone as it is.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.874
I hate putting something out in
the world that isn't perfect.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.084
Well, it's close enough, okay,

02:46.251 --> 02:48.753
and I'm not waiting another year
for this to come around.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.129
We're doing it.

02:51.464 --> 02:54.467
Okay.
Well, I'm excited as well.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.972
Clearly, yeah, you're excited.

03:02.141 --> 03:04.602
Do you ever wear pants?

03:04.769 --> 03:06.604
How long are you
staying here again?

03:08.314 --> 03:09.440
Are you tired of me already?

03:09.607 --> 03:11.609
Oh, I'm this close to calling INS.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.236
Morning.

03:13.403 --> 03:14.445
Wow.

03:14.612 --> 03:17.323
Okay, two weeks, you guys
are now sharing clothes?

03:17.490 --> 03:18.616
What? It's cute.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.827
And I haven't
done my laundry in weeks.

03:20.994 --> 03:22.495
Yeah, it's a choice.

03:22.662 --> 03:24.289
What? If it looks stupid,

03:24.455 --> 03:26.124
I'm gonna change it.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.625
It's fine.

03:27.792 --> 03:28.960
Fine?

03:29.127 --> 03:30.461
What does that mean?

03:30.628 --> 03:31.671
Okay, this is that moment

03:31.838 --> 03:33.631
when Daddy is about to hit
Mommy at the dinner table,

03:33.798 --> 03:36.634
so I'm gonna go ahead
and excuse myself.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.511
The whole point of having
a boyfriend who's the same

03:38.595 --> 03:40.805
size as you, is so you can double
your wardrobe.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.515
I wear that to work a lot.

03:42.682 --> 03:45.018
Oh, come on.
We work at MDG, not <i>Vogue.</i>

03:45.184 --> 03:47.687
This isn't the "Devil
Wears Dog" shirt.

03:47.854 --> 03:50.148
Patrick, we talked about
doing this a certain way.

03:50.315 --> 03:52.483
Doing what?

03:52.650 --> 03:55.320
First we tell people
that I've broken up with Jon,

03:55.486 --> 03:57.989
and then we allow
a courtesy gap.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.450
Oh, God, the courtesy gap
is a real thing?

04:00.617 --> 04:01.951
Yeah.

04:02.118 --> 04:03.202
When Brad broke up
with Jennifer,

04:03.369 --> 04:05.914
he didn't want people to know he
was fucking Angelina straightaway.

04:05.997 --> 04:07.290
There was a courtesy gap.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.292
All right, well,
I was always Team Jen, so.

04:09.459 --> 04:11.836
Oh, God. You don't think people
are gonna be Team Jon, do you?

04:12.003 --> 04:13.338
I'm just trying to be
sensitive about this.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.547
And I totally get that,

04:14.672 --> 04:17.050
but didn't we also talk
about taking baby steps?

04:17.216 --> 04:18.718
I mean, so far
we've just been cloistered

04:18.885 --> 04:20.678
in my room like gay nuns.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.513
Gay nuns who have
a lot of sex

04:22.680 --> 04:24.223
and eat a lot of pizza.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.017
That's very true, but...

04:26.184 --> 04:28.519
that doesn't feel
like moving forward.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.396
Right?

04:30.772 --> 04:32.649
- We've established a tension that--
- Doesn't have a payoff, so...

04:32.732 --> 04:34.984
we've found that we lose
most users at this point...

04:35.109 --> 04:36.527
Because the gameplay
falters here.

04:36.653 --> 04:38.905
You guys have got to stop
finishing each other's sentences.

04:39.072 --> 04:42.283
It's called teamwork, Owen.
Isn't it fun to be on a great team?

04:42.450 --> 04:44.369
I mean I guess, but I
think it's a little weird

04:44.535 --> 04:45.870
that you guys even buy
the same sweater.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.747
- Right?
- Yeah.

04:47.914 --> 04:49.374
I didn't buy this sweater.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.708
No.

04:52.043 --> 04:54.337
That is my sweater.

04:54.504 --> 04:55.588
Yeah, he said
I could borrow it

04:55.713 --> 04:57.507
as long as I promised
not to spill anything on it.

04:57.674 --> 04:59.008
Yeah, butterfingers here
spilled goji berries

04:59.175 --> 05:00.885
and yogurt all over
his floor this morning.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.597
Wait. Why were you at his house
so early in the morning?

05:04.764 --> 05:06.516
Because he...
he stayed over.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.227
Like... in your bed?

05:09.394 --> 05:10.561
Yeah.

05:13.356 --> 05:16.067
Because you guys
are a thing now?

05:16.985 --> 05:18.945
Yeah, that's one way of putting it.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.739
So Jon's totally
out of the picture now?

05:21.906 --> 05:23.574
Because he was supposed
to work on my sciatica.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.909
Hey, dude,
I can't get a heads-up?

05:25.076 --> 05:26.703
A heads-up about what?

05:26.869 --> 05:28.079
We've sat next to each other
for how long?

05:28.246 --> 05:29.747
Owen.

05:29.914 --> 05:33.292
Okay, if we can move on,
that would be really great.

05:33.418 --> 05:34.585
Yeah, we're good.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.796
Good, because we're all
adults here. It's really no big deal.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.923
Yeah, I just hope it won't
impact our company culture

05:39.090 --> 05:42.593
of fairness and that heterosexuals
won't be discriminated against.

05:44.095 --> 05:46.597
Of course, Meredith.
Absolutely.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.766
I think Owen was really pissed
I didn't tell him.

05:48.891 --> 05:51.936
Well, maybe he's just upset that
his friend is sleeping with his boss.

05:53.813 --> 05:56.274
Do you know that Meredith
marched straight to HR

05:56.441 --> 05:58.276
- after our meeting?
- Oh, my God.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.111
You don't think they could
actually fire us, do you?

06:00.278 --> 06:01.404
What? No.

06:01.571 --> 06:02.780
But there will be
some whisperings

06:02.947 --> 06:03.990
and there may be
some bitchy comments

06:04.157 --> 06:05.450
written on the toilet walls.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.285
Well, whatever.

06:07.452 --> 06:10.455
The gay genie is out
of the gay fucking bottle.

06:10.621 --> 06:11.664
Yes, it is.

06:11.831 --> 06:14.500
It'll just take some people
a little time to get used to it.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.961
Do you think your sister
will ever get used to it?

06:17.128 --> 06:19.172
Well, Megan thinks
that I destroyed

06:19.338 --> 06:21.758
the most perfect relationship
in the entire world, so no.

06:21.924 --> 06:22.967
But, whatever.

06:23.051 --> 06:24.469
I'm glad that it's out
in the public, you know?

06:24.635 --> 06:25.762
It makes it more real.

06:25.845 --> 06:28.431
This isn't some weird,
secret thing anymore.

06:28.598 --> 06:30.641
It's something
we can be proud of.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.563
Well, I am.
One hundred percent.

06:35.730 --> 06:37.607
Well, you should be,
'cause I'm a fucking catch.

06:37.774 --> 06:39.233
- Are you?
- Yeah.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.736
Especially in this sweater.

06:41.903 --> 06:43.988
So, it's, you know, it looks
a little messy right now,

06:44.155 --> 06:45.239
but it's gonna be great,
I think.

06:45.323 --> 06:46.491
Yeah.
Absolutely.

06:46.616 --> 06:47.742
I know I rushed into it,
and I didn't

06:47.825 --> 06:49.077
wait for the money
to come through.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.661
Yeah, well, I told him
not to rush it, you know?

06:50.828 --> 06:52.997
And I quit my job
and maxed out my credit cards,

06:53.164 --> 06:54.582
and I'll probably
end up homeless.

06:54.749 --> 06:57.502
But...
how exciting is this?

06:57.668 --> 06:59.003
This is so exciting.

06:59.170 --> 07:01.297
I mean it, too. I'm not
being sarcastic. I love it.

07:01.464 --> 07:05.802
This is my place,
and I can hardly believe it.

07:05.885 --> 07:07.220
Well, it's incredible, man.

07:07.303 --> 07:08.471
Cheers.

07:08.554 --> 07:09.722
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.015
- Cheers.
- Yay.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.350
Cheers, queers.

07:13.768 --> 07:14.811
Oh, God.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.646
Apparently I need
a new fridge, too.

07:16.813 --> 07:18.022
Yeah, you are
setting the stage

07:18.106 --> 07:19.857
for your first
one-star yelp review. Gross.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.609
If you really wanna help,
you could come put in

07:21.776 --> 07:24.153
the water filtration system
with me tomorrow.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.697
- Tomorrow's Vallejo.
- Vallejo?

07:26.948 --> 07:28.491
My niece
is having a birthday,

07:28.658 --> 07:30.368
but if you wanna stay
and help, babe, it's fine.

07:30.535 --> 07:31.702
No, I wanna meet 'em.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.496
We can do the water
thingy later, right?

07:33.663 --> 07:35.039
Well, if we don't
put it in tomorrow,

07:35.206 --> 07:36.791
then I'll have to change
a whole bunch of...

07:36.958 --> 07:38.126
But you know what?
Don't worry about it.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.294
Just go. I'll call one
of the guys to help.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.712
No. You know what?
We'll come afterwards,

07:41.796 --> 07:42.922
after we're done, all right?

07:43.005 --> 07:44.215
- Seriously.
- We don't have to stay over.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.550
Seriously,
don't worry about it.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.051
Look at your chicken window.

07:47.218 --> 07:49.011
- Look at this.
- Look at it.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.055
I'm so proud of you.

07:51.222 --> 07:52.723
I am so proud of you.

07:52.807 --> 07:54.142
I'm proud of me, too.

08:02.150 --> 08:04.068
Are you sure we're
ready for this?

08:04.235 --> 08:05.570
Completely, yeah.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.072
Hurry, let's get in there.

08:08.281 --> 08:09.574
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.741
Hi, we're really late.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.535
It should be under <i>One Up Him,</i>
but if it's not...

08:12.702 --> 08:14.495
Matheson or Murray.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.747
Hey, did you remember
to put the new build on the iPads?

08:16.998 --> 08:18.583
Yeah, did I?
Fuck, did I?

08:18.749 --> 08:19.876
Did you?

08:20.042 --> 08:21.419
- Yeah.
- Don't do that!

08:21.586 --> 08:22.920
- Yes, thank you.
- Don't freak me out like that.

08:23.087 --> 08:24.422
- You got it.
- Thank you so much.

08:24.589 --> 08:26.757
She said it was
table number ten,

08:26.924 --> 08:28.217
next to some anime thing.

08:28.384 --> 08:30.094
But everything looks
like an anime thing.

08:30.261 --> 08:31.554
Oh, there.
I think it's over here.

08:34.849 --> 08:36.267
Good costumes
this year, right?

08:36.434 --> 08:37.518
Yeah, this is amazing.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.312
Oh, shit. Everybody is
set up except for us.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.688
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

08:40.771 --> 08:41.981
- Sorry. Sorry, boys.
- Can I just--

08:42.148 --> 08:43.941
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thanks.

08:45.026 --> 08:47.945
Oh, my God. They've got
porn guys over there.

08:48.905 --> 08:50.198
Nice.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.117
All right, where'd you
put the table clips?

08:53.284 --> 08:56.454
- Table-- Oh, fuck, sorry.
- Really?

08:57.038 --> 08:58.956
All right,
let me ask this guy.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.127
Hey, neighbor.

09:03.294 --> 09:05.796
Hey. Cute zip-up.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.465
Thank you.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.967
We were wondering, actually,
if you had any table clips?

09:10.134 --> 09:11.636
We left ours at home.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.137
Always be prepared,
homie.

09:13.304 --> 09:14.972
Come on,
this is GaymerX.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.099
- I know.
- Ryder, do we have clips?

09:17.266 --> 09:18.392
- Extra.
- Thank you.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.727
Perfect.

09:19.894 --> 09:21.771
- Thank you, so much.
- Sure.

09:21.938 --> 09:23.940
So what's Glorified?

09:24.106 --> 09:25.316
It looks like a spy game.

09:25.483 --> 09:26.651
Well, it's not.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.654
Glorified lets you find
all the nearest glory holes.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.405
You can give them ratings,

09:31.572 --> 09:34.951
leave comments, message,
meet up with other users.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.911
It's like
social networking

09:37.078 --> 09:38.996
for the
orally adventurous.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.248
Wow.

09:40.373 --> 09:41.666
I thought the whole point
was to not know

09:41.832 --> 09:43.251
who was on the other side
of the glory hole.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.670
No. The whole point
is to get your dick sucked

09:45.836 --> 09:47.505
or to suck a dick.

09:47.672 --> 09:49.131
- Right.
- So, <i>One Up Him,</i>

09:49.257 --> 09:50.758
is that a
Reese Witherspoon movie?

09:50.925 --> 09:52.468
No.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.178
It's actually a--
It's a matching game,

09:54.345 --> 09:57.682
where different kinds of gays
battle each other.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.767
- Different types of gays.
- Yeah.

09:59.934 --> 10:01.686
- Bears versus Twinks.
- Yeah.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.355
So, your game's
about stereotypes.

10:04.522 --> 10:07.191
Well, no, it's more-- it's more
about subverting stereotypes.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.027
Got it.
It'll be interesting to see

10:10.194 --> 10:12.655
what you and your brother
think "subverting" means.

10:12.822 --> 10:14.699
That's not my brother.
That's my boyfriend.

10:14.824 --> 10:15.866
Really?

10:15.992 --> 10:17.201
You guys are like identical.

10:17.326 --> 10:18.619
Why don't you just jerk off
in the mirror

10:18.786 --> 10:20.246
if you think you're so cute?

10:21.831 --> 10:22.915
Thanks for the clips.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.542
You're welcome.
Welcome to GaymerX!

10:24.709 --> 10:25.876
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.378
Thanks.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.719
I'm close, I'm close.

10:37.138 --> 10:39.473
I wanna see you cum.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.443
Give it to me,
give me that wood.

10:50.568 --> 10:51.902
- Where do you want it?
- On my chest, baby.

10:52.028 --> 10:53.237
- You want it?
- Yeah.

10:53.321 --> 10:54.905
- You fucking want it?
- Yeah.

10:55.406 --> 10:57.533
Oh!

10:59.702 --> 11:02.038
Oh--

11:02.204 --> 11:03.581
No, it's fine.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.375
- Cum for me.
- Okay.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.085
Come on. Now you're
going to cum for me.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.755
Cum for me, baby.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.097
- I'm gonna-- I'm just gonna...
- Yeah.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.932
- I'm gonna clean this.
- Okay.

11:29.607 --> 11:30.691
Yeah?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.193
Everything okay?

11:33.569 --> 11:35.279
Yeah.

11:35.446 --> 11:37.740
You're sure?

11:37.907 --> 11:39.450
Totally.

11:39.617 --> 11:41.118
Totally,
I'll be right out.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.133
I mean,
I know it's fine.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.802
I know you can't
get it from that,

11:57.968 --> 11:59.470
and even if you could,
he's undetectable.

11:59.637 --> 12:01.889
So it's like, why am I
still in my head about it?

12:02.056 --> 12:05.226
Why am I the go-to on having
an AIDS meltdown friend?

12:05.393 --> 12:09.105
Because you're old...
and wise.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.481
Hand me the channel lock.

12:10.648 --> 12:11.899
The what?

12:12.066 --> 12:13.984
The channel lock.
It's got blue handles.

12:14.068 --> 12:15.319
These are pliers.

12:15.403 --> 12:16.779
Well, these pliers
are channel locks.

12:16.946 --> 12:18.114
Dom, I'm in crisis here.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.658
The least you could do is refer
to tools by their actual names.

12:20.825 --> 12:21.992
You're not in crisis,
Agustín.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.161
You're just freaked out
because there's a possibility

12:24.328 --> 12:27.248
you may not be equipped to date
someone who's HIV positive.

12:27.415 --> 12:30.501
It's not 1994.
Just... go on PrEP.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.086
Get over it.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.421
Wow, okay.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.172
Looks like someone got
their library card.

12:35.339 --> 12:36.966
No, someone was just
hoping his friend

12:37.133 --> 12:39.176
who said he'd come help
would actually help.

12:39.343 --> 12:40.636
But you know I'm shitty
with tools.

12:40.719 --> 12:41.846
Why didn't you call Doris?

12:41.971 --> 12:44.849
She's with Malik in Vallejo.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.809
Oh, looks like someone's
gonna need a new hag.

12:46.976 --> 12:48.644
- Fuck off.
- You should try Craigslist.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.521
Hags love Craigslist.

12:50.688 --> 12:52.022
I can see it now.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.859
"Castro clone seeks funny lady."

12:55.860 --> 12:57.653
One Up Him
is a battling game,

12:57.820 --> 12:59.697
where you fight
using gay archetypes.

12:59.864 --> 13:02.533
- That sounds very 2009 to me.
- Yes. No, I totally get that.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.368
But let me just show you
how it works, really quickly.

13:04.535 --> 13:05.703
You choose a category.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.329
So you go to fierceness, okay?

13:07.496 --> 13:08.998
And then you pick the one
that's the most fierce--

13:09.165 --> 13:10.332
so let's say, "The Furry..."

13:10.416 --> 13:11.542
...and then you hit "Select."

13:11.709 --> 13:13.002
It's cool, isn't it?

13:14.128 --> 13:15.296
Is something supposed
to be happening?

13:15.463 --> 13:16.547
Yea, no, we're
still debugging it.

13:16.714 --> 13:19.383
I just--
Oh, fuck, not again.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.634
I'm gonna go play
Bro-Force.

13:20.718 --> 13:22.219
Okay, well, just come back
if you want to, okay?

13:22.386 --> 13:23.554
We're just over
at this booth over here.

13:23.721 --> 13:25.973
You guys know-- you know
how it goes with the...

13:26.140 --> 13:27.558
You use two people...

13:27.725 --> 13:29.059
Well, that's the whole point
of the game.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.187
Actually like each other.
Yeah, yeah.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.648
Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

13:34.732 --> 13:36.108
- Brady is covering GaymerX.
- Yup.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.318
Well.

13:37.485 --> 13:38.986
Yeah, the last article
went really well,

13:39.153 --> 13:41.071
so they're thinking maybe
this is like

13:41.238 --> 13:43.532
a cover story or something.

13:43.699 --> 13:44.742
Isn't that rad?

13:44.909 --> 13:46.202
So rad.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.828
What about you?
What are you doing here?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.747
What? I love video games.

13:51.415 --> 13:54.877
No, I knew this would be
amazing, so I made him come.

13:55.044 --> 13:56.587
Well, that's great.
Welcome to GaymerX.

13:56.754 --> 13:59.006
Thanks.
So are you guys...

13:59.173 --> 14:00.508
Working together, yeah.
We actually--

14:00.674 --> 14:02.259
We created
this app together

14:02.426 --> 14:04.261
and this conference
only happens once a year,

14:04.428 --> 14:05.554
so we thought
it was really important

14:05.721 --> 14:07.765
to commit, and get it here,
and get it out.

14:07.932 --> 14:09.808
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.771
You-- Are you guys
sticking around tonight

14:13.938 --> 14:15.606
for the prom after-party?

14:15.731 --> 14:16.857
Oh, my God, yeah.

14:16.941 --> 14:18.901
Well, do you wanna grab
a bite to eat after?

14:19.068 --> 14:20.236
It could be--

14:20.402 --> 14:21.779
It could be
like a double date.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.740
So you guys
are dating now or...

14:24.907 --> 14:26.784
Us, yeah. Oh, you thought
he dumped me.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.077
Well, that's not
exactly what I said.

14:28.244 --> 14:29.745
Well, that's exactly
what happened. You dumped me,

14:29.912 --> 14:32.456
but then you took me back,
which was awesome for me,

14:32.623 --> 14:34.667
because I realized
I couldn't be without him.

14:36.168 --> 14:38.587
That's cool. So you guys
are like a thing now.

14:38.754 --> 14:40.798
- Yes, we are.
- We're a--

14:40.965 --> 14:42.841
- I think, yes, we are.
- Yeah, we are a thing. Yes.

14:43.008 --> 14:46.679
Okay. Gamer couple
creates an app, breaks up,

14:46.845 --> 14:50.474
but reunites for love
of the game and each other,

14:50.641 --> 14:52.434
and has a massive showing
at GaymerX.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.353
This is
my fucking cover story.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.021
- Oh, my God.
- Great.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.607
This is hilarious,
by the way.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.568
I guess that makes you
"Homewrecker Gay."

15:00.651 --> 15:02.528
That is-- Oh, my God,
"Homewrecker Gay."

15:02.695 --> 15:04.697
That's a really good suggestion.
We need a suggestion box here.

15:04.947 --> 15:05.990
<i>All right, who's ready</i>

15:06.156 --> 15:08.158
<i>for the big GaymerX
cosplay pageant?</i>

15:08.325 --> 15:12.371
This is the costume thing.
I gotta shoot this, but... tonight.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.623
Okay? Get ready.
We're going deep.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.834
- Let's go deep.
- Good for you.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.379
- Thanks, Richie.
<i>- Are you ready?</i>

15:23.716 --> 15:25.509
- Wow.
- Okay.

15:28.012 --> 15:29.722
- You're a hypocrite, Patrick Murray.
- Oh, come on.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.016
What was I supposed to do?
Text him out of the blue,

15:32.182 --> 15:34.226
and be like,
"BT-dubs, dating Kevin,

15:34.393 --> 15:36.520
he broke up with Jon,"
smiley, winky emoticon?

15:36.687 --> 15:38.188
After all the shit
you've been giving me?

15:38.355 --> 15:41.025
The hypocrisy does not undermine
my point that I'm trying make.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.359
It does a little.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.861
Maybe a little bit,
but I still think...

15:43.944 --> 15:45.738
You're very cute
when you're wrong.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.368
Okay.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.162
Look at this.

15:53.329 --> 15:54.747
We could be brothers.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.084
Hey, twincest.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.711
Get a room.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.087
Don't worry,
we already have one.

16:02.254 --> 16:03.464
Yeah.

16:05.591 --> 16:07.051
What does that mean?

16:07.217 --> 16:08.886
Are you ready for this?

16:10.721 --> 16:12.765
- Ta-da.
- This is nice.

16:14.767 --> 16:17.561
- You sneaky little puppy.
- But wait, there's more.

16:17.645 --> 16:18.729
- More?
- Yes.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.272
Follow me into the bedroom.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.569
I brought our suits
for the prom.

16:25.736 --> 16:26.779
Ah, well done.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.238
That's my favorite tie.

16:28.322 --> 16:31.200
- I know.
- You must've known that.

16:31.408 --> 16:32.534
Flowers.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.244
Patrick.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.289
Are you trying to redo some bad
high school prom experience?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.750
Well, my prom was basically
like in <i>21 Jump Street</i>

16:39.917 --> 16:42.878
when that nerdy girl
lit the gym on fire, so yes.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.297
But now, I have a very
important question for you.

16:45.631 --> 16:46.924
Oh, God.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.302
- Kevin Matheson?
- Yeah.

16:50.469 --> 16:53.889
Will you be my gay
gamer prom date?

16:54.056 --> 16:55.974
- I thought you'd never ask.
- Oh!

16:59.645 --> 17:01.105
Hey.

17:03.399 --> 17:05.401
Is this your hiding spot?

17:05.567 --> 17:06.735
This is my
work-too-frigging-much-

17:06.902 --> 17:07.986
and-I-need-a-break spot.

17:10.114 --> 17:12.157
Jesus Christ,
this fucking city.

17:13.158 --> 17:15.411
It's 85 degrees and burning,
and then an hour later,

17:15.619 --> 17:18.455
it's negative 14
and freezing.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.040
You kinda disappeared on me.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.294
Yeah, Dom needed help
with the new place.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.339
Yeah, I can't do this, Agustín.

17:27.506 --> 17:28.841
Do what?

17:29.007 --> 17:30.968
I've been through it
too many times.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.512
A really well-intentioned guy
says that he's totally cool,

17:33.679 --> 17:35.639
and well informed,
and big surprise, he's not.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.307
I just can't anymore.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.726
Okay, that's not
what's going on.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.185
No, do you have
any idea what it's like

17:40.310 --> 17:43.021
to be a big poz queer
in this town?

17:43.188 --> 17:44.773
Everyone in San Francisco
loves to talk about

17:44.940 --> 17:46.775
how well informed they are
and how inclusive they are.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.193
But, like, really,
when you get down to it,

17:48.360 --> 17:50.988
they're just the same
self-hating, close-minded,

17:51.155 --> 17:52.322
racist gays that you see

17:52.489 --> 17:54.408
prancing on Santa Monica
Boulevard in WeHo.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.368
Okay, okay, look.

17:56.535 --> 17:59.872
I got weird, okay,
and I don't know why.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.498
It's something
I gotta work on.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.666
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah,

18:02.833 --> 18:04.460
but I will work on it, okay?

18:04.626 --> 18:08.338
Because for whatever reason
I'm super into you.

18:10.883 --> 18:13.051
Now listen,
go get your stuff

18:13.218 --> 18:14.887
because it's Kylie night
at Toad Hall,

18:15.053 --> 18:18.307
and we're long overdue
for a shirtless dance session.

18:18.474 --> 18:19.850
You know we are.

18:21.852 --> 18:23.270
Fine.

18:27.775 --> 18:29.193
Wow, look at this!

18:30.778 --> 18:32.362
Oh, wow!

18:33.405 --> 18:35.991
This is already a thousand
times better than high school.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.576
This is crazy.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.042
- I have a question.
- Oh, yeah?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.418
Will you dance with me?

18:48.670 --> 18:49.963
No.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.403
Everybody loves him.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.407
What else? What else?

19:17.866 --> 19:20.410
- Kissing, right?
- Yeah, kissing, yes.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.705
- Look how gangster you are in that.
- This is so much fun.

19:23.872 --> 19:24.957
I have a lazy eye in that.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.669
Oh.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.212
I look a little chunks.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.215
- But you look great.
- No you don't. You look wonderful.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.382
<i>Hey, you've reached Doris.
I'm not here.</i>

20:59.092 --> 21:03.555
Hey, I just wanted to see
how the birthday party went.

21:05.349 --> 21:07.017
Hope you're having fun
in Vallejo,

21:07.184 --> 21:09.353
partying hard
with all the seven-year-olds.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.022
Say hi to Malik for me.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.026
Anyway, so I'm assuming

21:16.193 --> 21:18.695
you're not coming back,
which is fine.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.866
Yeah, have fun.

21:37.381 --> 21:38.882
You okay?

21:39.049 --> 21:41.009
I'm so good.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.344
Why do you keep
asking me that?

21:42.511 --> 21:44.096
You'll feel better
if you eat your eggs, Brady.

21:44.262 --> 21:46.723
You'll feel better
if you eat your eggs, Patsmith.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.017
I have pancakes.

21:49.184 --> 21:50.727
It's gonna make you fat.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.940
- Well.
- He's got a point.

21:55.107 --> 21:57.609
- Really?
- Hey.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.612
Can you take me
to the bathroom

22:00.779 --> 22:02.406
before I throw up?

22:04.157 --> 22:05.701
Me? No, ask Richie.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.411
No, no, no.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.414
Richie's judging me and--

22:10.580 --> 22:13.959
and the way you talk,
it's like Mary Poppins.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.627
Shit, so
I want you to take me.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.213
I choose you, Pikachu.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.550
- All right, then.
- Are you sure you're okay?

22:21.717 --> 22:23.760
Yeah, of course.
I can take you to throw up.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.095
Okay, don't throw up on me.

22:25.262 --> 22:27.139
- Yell if you need help, okay?
- Yeah, I will.

22:29.266 --> 22:30.976
Oh, my God.

22:32.561 --> 22:34.604
Oh, boy.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.815
So much for that
in-depth interview, I guess.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.527
He's a bit of a lightweight.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.488
He's a good guy, though.

22:43.655 --> 22:44.906
I see why you like him.

22:46.575 --> 22:48.827
He's better
when he's not wasted.

22:48.994 --> 22:50.454
I can relate to that.

22:55.292 --> 22:57.127
I was surprised
to see you two together.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.464
Yeah, I bet.

23:02.632 --> 23:03.925
I thought you were
pretty done with him.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.302
I was.

23:06.261 --> 23:08.764
What happened?

23:08.930 --> 23:10.807
Well, I went to a funeral,

23:10.974 --> 23:13.018
and then I got into
a car accident.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.270
- God, are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.482
Whose funeral was it?

23:18.648 --> 23:20.817
It was actually Doris' dad,
who I don't even know,

23:20.984 --> 23:24.196
but I completely
burst into tears,

23:24.362 --> 23:25.822
and then
when I got back...

23:27.657 --> 23:28.825
Kevin was standing
on my doorstep,

23:28.992 --> 23:30.368
and he'd broken up with Jon.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.705
And the last time
someone stood on my stoop,

23:33.872 --> 23:35.957
they told me I wasn't ready,

23:36.124 --> 23:41.463
so... this time I just--
I decided to go for it.

23:44.216 --> 23:46.051
- Guys.
- Yeah.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.344
Guess who's cool?

23:47.511 --> 23:48.887
- Who?
- This guy.

23:49.054 --> 23:51.681
- Oh, yeah.
- No, we had a false alarm.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.725
Yeah, saving it.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.395
Saving all my vomit for you.

23:57.562 --> 23:58.980
Wow.

23:59.106 --> 24:02.192
No, I'm gonna take back all
the shit I said about you guys.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.111
Brady.

24:04.861 --> 24:05.987
We are gonna take back

24:06.154 --> 24:09.241
all the shit
we said about you guys.

24:09.407 --> 24:11.576
And what kinda shit
would that be?

24:11.743 --> 24:14.079
Patrick's not
a 13-year-old girl

24:14.246 --> 24:16.998
who's afraid
of her own vagina.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.543
Oh, wow!

24:19.709 --> 24:21.753
And the two of you together--

24:21.920 --> 24:24.589
that's not what's wrong with
the gay community. Trust me.

24:25.841 --> 24:27.175
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.344
Really? Are you sure?

24:29.511 --> 24:33.014
Because he seems to have really
specific points of reference.

24:33.181 --> 24:36.059
Are you going to
finish your pancakes?

24:36.226 --> 24:38.687
You know, Brady, I've never
not finished my pancakes,

24:38.854 --> 24:41.606
but, for you,

24:41.773 --> 24:43.066
get in there.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.573
God, I'm happy I didn't
go back to Seattle.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.033
There's nothing
but rain and granola.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.037
I remember the first time
I came to the Bay.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.372
I was at Berkley,

24:57.539 --> 25:00.083
and Agustín and I went up
to Indian Rock,

25:00.250 --> 25:04.045
and looked down,
and I thought, "Yes,

25:04.212 --> 25:07.132
I just wanna stay here
for as long as I can hang on."

25:10.135 --> 25:11.928
Yep, it's no good, I'm too cold.
We gotta go back inside.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.055
- Come on, let's go, let's go.
- Okay. All right.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.270
I cannot believe how many
glory holes there are in this area.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.564
I know.

25:22.731 --> 25:24.441
Oh, my God, we just
got our first review.

25:24.524 --> 25:25.609
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:25.692 --> 25:26.860
Well, what does it say?

25:26.943 --> 25:28.069
It says, "Another attempt

25:28.153 --> 25:30.322
to divide and label
the gay community.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.073
Bullshit. One star."

25:33.742 --> 25:35.410
"Bullshit"?

25:35.577 --> 25:38.121
Well, I guess we got to expect
things like that, right?

25:40.916 --> 25:42.626
Do you know what?

25:42.792 --> 25:44.169
Fuck that bitchy queen.

25:44.336 --> 25:45.587
We're not going to
please everyone.

25:45.754 --> 25:47.130
I am proud of what
we've achieved.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.798
Oh, my God.
I love you.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.969
I'm-- I mean I...

25:54.304 --> 25:55.597
Are you freakin' out
a bit, now?

25:55.764 --> 25:57.265
A little bit.
I've never said that before.

25:57.432 --> 25:58.975
What? Not even to your mum?

25:59.142 --> 26:00.685
We don't say that
in my family.

26:02.145 --> 26:05.357
But... I do.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.029
I love you.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.119
I love you, too.
