00:02.244 --> 00:04.061
Well, this is it, Julian.

00:04.196 --> 00:05.746
(chuckles)
Moment of truth.

00:05.898 --> 00:07.898
First solo flight.

00:07.916 --> 00:09.824
How you feeling?

00:09.844 --> 00:12.160
I feel alive, Eddie.

00:12.254 --> 00:15.072
I feel exhilarated.

00:15.165 --> 00:17.499
I feel...

00:17.593 --> 00:19.426
terrified. Maybe we should
do one more together.

00:19.578 --> 00:20.853
Julian.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.430
Do you recall what you told me
the first day you hired me?

00:23.582 --> 00:25.916
Why you wanted
to be certified as a pilot

00:26.009 --> 00:28.009
in the first place?

00:28.029 --> 00:29.511
Because I was sick of feeling

00:29.530 --> 00:31.846
like the world
was trying to suffocate me.

00:31.866 --> 00:34.107
Because I wanted to feel free.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.660
So go break free.

(whooshing)

I'm so grateful.

02:23.886 --> 02:25.035
There's still a good man

in their lives
looking out for them.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.815
(sniffling)

02:30.042 --> 02:31.057
It's okay.

02:31.210 --> 02:33.301
The funeral was two weeks ago.

02:33.395 --> 02:35.228
You'd think I'd be able
to go two minutes without

02:35.322 --> 02:37.564
-a tissue break.
-No, let it out.

02:37.716 --> 02:39.158
Y'all just keep practicing.

02:39.309 --> 02:41.410
I'll be right back.

02:42.812 --> 02:44.070
Let it out.

02:44.223 --> 02:45.480
You okay?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.724
I... I know that's
a stupid question.

02:47.743 --> 02:49.150
No. No, it's not.

02:49.244 --> 02:52.062
Every time I think
I have a toehold on my sanity,

02:52.155 --> 02:54.247
then just...

02:54.341 --> 02:57.426
it just hits me all over again.

(exhales)

03:08.080 --> 03:09.837
Uh...

03:09.932 --> 03:12.006
Charles', uh...

03:12.100 --> 03:14.751
his life insurance came in.

03:14.770 --> 03:17.362
And it's-it's more
than I expected.

03:17.589 --> 03:20.014
You know, he was always
looking out for the girls.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.776
-Yeah, he was.
-So I'm thinking...

03:22.928 --> 03:24.110
it's my turn.

03:24.263 --> 03:26.354
-What do you mean?
-That the only reason

03:26.373 --> 03:29.524
I put that uniform back on
was to support my family.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.768
So...

03:31.861 --> 03:33.879
he's taken care of that now.

03:34.030 --> 03:36.440
So, hold up, you love that job.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.717
It's a part
of who you are, too, now.

03:38.868 --> 03:40.052
It is.

03:40.203 --> 03:41.887
But what am I supposed to do?

03:42.038 --> 03:43.889
Well, have you told

03:44.040 --> 03:46.040
TK or Nancy
what you're thinking?

03:46.134 --> 03:48.042
They're coming over tomorrow.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.395
And I'll-I'll
break it to them then.

03:50.622 --> 03:53.306
Well, I feel for you, T.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.549
Good luck.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.902
You know what,
you save some of that luck

03:57.129 --> 03:58.737
for yourself.

03:58.888 --> 04:00.388
Because tomorrow is a big day

04:00.482 --> 04:02.724
-for both of you.
-(chuckles)

04:02.743 --> 04:04.468
Back at the call center?

04:04.561 --> 04:06.636
You must be counting
down the hours.

04:06.730 --> 04:09.139
I'm a little excited.
Just a little bit.

04:09.157 --> 04:10.565
How about you, Juddy?

04:10.659 --> 04:13.085
Have they given you
any idea which firehouse

04:13.312 --> 04:14.920
-you're gonna report to?
-Nope.

04:15.071 --> 04:17.163
Nope, the, uh, the last I heard

04:17.316 --> 04:18.999
from the brass of the department
is we're supposed to get

04:19.151 --> 04:21.409
a call in the morning giving us
our temporary assignments.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.653
And Owen hasn't been able
to give you a heads-up?

04:23.672 --> 04:26.748
-No, he's just as
in the dark as we are.
-Hmm.

04:26.842 --> 04:29.159
Yeah, how is Owen?

04:29.252 --> 04:31.011
-(laughs)
-Pushing paper around

04:31.163 --> 04:32.771
for the deputy chief?

04:32.998 --> 04:34.164
You know Owen, you know,

04:34.182 --> 04:36.333
he likes to jump in
with both feet.

04:36.351 --> 04:38.384
Limes.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.154
I've been thinking
a lot about limes.

04:42.190 --> 04:43.782
Because limes,
ladies and gentlemen,

04:44.009 --> 04:46.100
are how we are going
to find efficiencies.

04:46.194 --> 04:48.787
Last year, an airline saved

04:49.014 --> 04:51.197
$500,000

04:51.292 --> 04:53.608
by slicing the limes
into 16 pieces

04:53.627 --> 04:56.628
-instead of ten.
-So a half million in limes?

04:56.855 --> 05:00.023
In limes. So I have scoured
our department's budget

05:00.025 --> 05:03.393
and found many
"sliced lime" expenses.

05:03.453 --> 05:04.803
Now, these are things
that we could

05:05.030 --> 05:07.047
scale back or cut, and nobody's

05:07.199 --> 05:08.715
ever gonna know the difference.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.051
So, if every fire station

05:11.203 --> 05:13.870
adjusted its thermostat
one degree,

05:13.889 --> 05:16.315
we'd save $127,000 a year.

05:16.466 --> 05:19.151
We spend $60,000
on plant watering services.

05:19.302 --> 05:21.320
That's something
we should be doing ourselves.

05:21.471 --> 05:23.380
Particularly when
we know that caring

05:23.398 --> 05:25.807
for plants is good
for our mental wellness.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.901
It's a true fact. And...

05:27.995 --> 05:30.387
-it goes on.
-For 196 pages.

05:30.405 --> 05:33.815
Now, it says here that you
project 2.7 million in savings.

05:33.909 --> 05:36.576
Yes, and the appendix in the
back breaks down those numbers.

05:36.728 --> 05:39.563
And we're gonna need
every penny 'cause,

05:39.656 --> 05:41.340
accounting for the rise
in fuel and energy,

05:41.567 --> 05:43.658
next year this time,
we're gonna be hurting.

05:43.752 --> 05:46.178
RADFORD:
Well, I must say,
Captain Strand, I am, uh,

05:46.329 --> 05:48.588
I'm very impressed,
though I'm hardly surprised

05:48.682 --> 05:50.407
by your embrace
of your administrative duties.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.851
Well, it gives me something
to do while I'm waiting

05:53.002 --> 05:54.411
for the 126 to come back online.

05:54.429 --> 05:56.763
Look, I need your help
with the city planners.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.248
They are just
dragging their feet

05:58.266 --> 05:59.841
approving the crews
to finish the work

05:59.860 --> 06:01.434
-on the firehouse.
-Well, you just have

06:01.528 --> 06:03.103
to have a little patience
with these things.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.589
-With all due respect,
I've been patient.
-For two weeks.

06:05.682 --> 06:07.366
Which is 13 longer
than it should take.

06:07.593 --> 06:10.610
Captain, can I, uh,
can I speak to you for a moment

06:10.762 --> 06:11.945
-outside?
-Sure.

06:12.097 --> 06:13.354
<i> RADFORD:</i>
<i> Do you know</i>

06:13.448 --> 06:14.764
I considered
bringing you down to Texas

06:14.858 --> 06:17.283
one of the greatest
accomplishments of my career?

06:17.436 --> 06:19.102
Well, that's very nice
of you to say.

06:19.121 --> 06:20.937
No, I mean it.
Why, it is incredible

06:21.030 --> 06:23.215
how fast you remolded the 126

06:23.442 --> 06:26.276
into the strongest station
in our city.

06:26.294 --> 06:28.536
And I just have to wonder
if you could do that

06:28.630 --> 06:32.373
with one house, what you could
do with a whole department.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.393
Well, I'm happy to help
in any way.

06:34.544 --> 06:37.229
I'm not asking
for your help, Captain.

06:37.422 --> 06:39.714
I'm asking you to be Austin's

06:39.733 --> 06:41.625
next deputy fire chief.

06:41.718 --> 06:45.070
(chuckling):
Well, isn't that your job?

06:45.221 --> 06:47.072
Well, I'm retiring, Owen.

06:47.299 --> 06:49.816
That's why I wanted you
assigned to my staff.

06:49.968 --> 06:52.226
Because there is nobody
that I'd rather

06:52.246 --> 06:54.579
pass the reins on to than you.

06:54.731 --> 06:56.640
Wow.

06:56.733 --> 06:59.084
Um... that's very,

06:59.311 --> 07:00.234
uh...

07:00.328 --> 07:02.662
-Wow.
<i> -ANDREWS: Think you'll find</i>

07:02.756 --> 07:04.330
your time here
a little less eventful than

07:04.483 --> 07:06.258
what you're used to,
Firefighter Strickland.

07:06.485 --> 07:09.577
We don't get the crazy,
high-octane calls

07:09.596 --> 07:11.488
that the 126 is known for.

07:11.506 --> 07:13.414
Ah, no worries. Not many
stations do, Captain Andrews.

07:13.508 --> 07:14.824
That said,

07:14.918 --> 07:17.677
we do make the most of
our downtime here at the 122.

07:17.829 --> 07:21.347
We slow roast most of our meals
over our BBQ smoker.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.333
And we grow
our own vegetables out back.

07:23.426 --> 07:25.944
-Over there?
-Yeah, full garden.

07:26.171 --> 07:28.171
And we maintain
the third-largest

07:28.190 --> 07:29.948
lending library in the city.

07:30.175 --> 07:31.858
You have a lending library?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.343
Well, yeah, didn't the 126?

07:33.361 --> 07:34.844
Uh, no, and I am a reader.

07:34.863 --> 07:37.438
Well, you'll have plenty
of opportunities for that here.

07:37.532 --> 07:40.792
That is, of course, when you're
not on the pickleball courts.

07:40.944 --> 07:42.294
I don't even know what that is.

07:42.445 --> 07:44.629
Trust me, you are gonna love it.

07:44.856 --> 07:48.425
First, a couple folks I thought
you may want to say hello to.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.045
Judd, Marj?

07:52.197 --> 07:53.305
Hey, my man!

07:53.532 --> 07:55.031
What's up, family!
I didn't know you guys

07:55.124 --> 07:56.700
-were gonna be here.
-Neither did we,

07:56.718 --> 07:59.335
until about two hours ago
when the department called.

07:59.337 --> 08:01.313
I'm so pumped. I thought
we were all gonna be split up

08:01.464 --> 08:03.723
-until the 126 opened
its doors again.
-Yeah, we all did.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.967
Not to mention this place
is like a damn country club.

08:06.061 --> 08:07.227
Oh, yeah, we drew
the long straws.

08:07.379 --> 08:08.636
-Yeah, we did.
-This is outstanding.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.531
I-I can't believe
we all ended up here together.

08:13.051 --> 08:14.809
W... W-Where's Probie?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.402
MARJAN:
Uh...

08:16.497 --> 08:19.664
(indistinct chatter)

08:19.816 --> 08:22.483
Put your back into it, grunt, or
that stain's never coming out.

08:22.503 --> 08:26.229
And you still owe me
all the latrines.

08:26.248 --> 08:30.083
You know, Captain,
if it's all the same,

08:30.177 --> 08:33.903
I kind of just prefer
Probie or Chavez.

08:33.997 --> 08:36.239
Even just Mateo's cool, too.

08:36.258 --> 08:39.309
Grunts speak only when
spoken to at the 129.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.187
You-you were speaking to me.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.433
-What is this, anyway?
-Hank there

08:47.586 --> 08:49.528
spilled his dip cup
the other day.

08:49.679 --> 08:51.679
My bad.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.107
Oh, gross.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.035
You know, if this is tobacco,

08:57.262 --> 08:58.853
I'm gonna need
a heavier-duty cleaner.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.165
Do you guys have any sodium
thisulfate laying around here?

09:03.359 --> 09:06.102
You can pick some up
when you grab lunch.

09:06.121 --> 09:07.437
Who feels like patty melts?

09:07.530 --> 09:09.289
-FIREFIGHTERS: Yeah.
-That sounds great, Cap.

09:09.441 --> 09:11.791
The boys want patty melts.

09:11.943 --> 09:13.626
You got it.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.871
-(fire alarm ringing)
-All right, 129,

09:16.890 --> 09:19.224
let's roll.

09:20.302 --> 09:21.726
Where you think
you're going, grunt?

09:21.878 --> 09:23.603
You're on lunch duty.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.738
-Hey, guys. Come on in.
-Hey.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.240
-Hi.
-Good to see you.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.967
-Hey, Cap.
-Hey. Oh, I'm sorry

09:37.986 --> 09:39.911
we couldn't meet
someplace more fun.

09:40.138 --> 09:41.746
I'm just, um, you know,

09:41.898 --> 09:44.249
anchored to the house right now.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.733
Oh, no worries.

09:45.827 --> 09:47.234
Where are the kids?

09:47.254 --> 09:49.087
Oh, they're in their room,
finishing up some homework,

09:49.314 --> 09:51.331
waiting for the pizza to arrive.

09:51.483 --> 09:53.833
Oh, um, you guys
want some coffee?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.151
-Yeah.
-TK: If some is made,

09:55.170 --> 09:56.711
yeah, please.
Thank you.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.338
So, Cap, any update

09:58.432 --> 10:00.156
on when we'll get back
out on the street?

10:00.175 --> 10:02.175
Still waiting for a house

10:02.327 --> 10:03.935
with an ambulance bay
to open up.

10:04.087 --> 10:05.495
TK:
Copy that.

10:05.513 --> 10:07.421
Just feels a little weird
collecting a paycheck

10:07.515 --> 10:09.256
while the rig
is just collecting dust

10:09.276 --> 10:10.609
in some city garage.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.852
NANCY:
I'm at peace with it.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.779
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

10:14.931 --> 10:16.531
Yeah.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.009
Coffee's sick, by the way.

10:20.028 --> 10:22.862
TK:
Mm-hmm.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.014
What roast is this?

10:25.033 --> 10:27.959
Oh, it's, um...

10:28.186 --> 10:29.669
it's not the roast.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.857
It's the chicory.
(chuckles)

10:33.875 --> 10:35.967
Charles, uh...

10:36.194 --> 10:38.544
discovered it on a trip
to New Orleans.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.213
It's what he served
in the restaurant.

10:40.365 --> 10:42.365
And what we just restocked

10:42.384 --> 10:44.217
for the re-opening.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.036
Well... it's really nice.

10:47.055 --> 10:48.563
TK:
Yeah.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.374
Okay, listen, um...

10:51.393 --> 10:54.135
I want you two to know that

10:54.154 --> 10:57.046
working with you has been
the greatest blessing

10:57.140 --> 10:59.699
of my professional career.

11:00.977 --> 11:02.994
You're not coming back, are you?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.146
I can't.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.240
The girls-- they-they need me

11:07.334 --> 11:09.000
for this next chapter now.

11:09.152 --> 11:12.671
More than ever, and I'm...

11:12.898 --> 11:14.080
I'm so sorry.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.823
No.
Don't feel bad.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.008
You're not the first captain

11:17.160 --> 11:18.843
I've had leave
to take care of family.

11:18.995 --> 11:20.086
Right.
Michelle.

11:20.238 --> 11:22.088
And I have nothing
but love and respect

11:22.182 --> 11:24.432
for Michelle,
and this is no different.

11:27.412 --> 11:29.412
Except that it is different.

11:29.431 --> 11:31.931
You're, um...

11:32.083 --> 11:34.008
my mentor

11:34.102 --> 11:38.029
of how I want to be
as a paramedic,

11:38.181 --> 11:40.699
as a captain...

11:42.110 --> 11:44.093
...and, hopefully, one day,

11:44.187 --> 11:47.414
a long, long time from now,
a mom.

11:49.692 --> 11:51.025
I'm sorry.

11:51.119 --> 11:52.936
-This is super awkward.
-No.

11:53.029 --> 11:55.338
No, um...
(laughs)

11:56.532 --> 11:58.608
As if I needed
another reason to cry.

11:59.461 --> 12:01.611
WAITRESS:
I've got a kale
antioxidant salad

12:01.629 --> 12:04.872
and a bacon blue burger
with extra rings.

12:04.966 --> 12:06.516
BILLY:
Thank you.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.470
Like staring into
the face of God.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.731
Yeah, you eat that whole thing,
you'll see God soon enough.

12:12.882 --> 12:15.942
Well, at least it'll be this
putting me in the ground,

12:16.127 --> 12:17.643
not the cancer.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.630
What do you mean,
not the cancer?

12:20.648 --> 12:22.699
My last follow-up.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.986
Doc said radiation
took out two of my tumors.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.080
Last one's on the run.

12:29.232 --> 12:30.807
Billy, that's great news.

12:30.825 --> 12:33.400
Yeah, yeah, well, before you go
getting all rah-rah,

12:33.495 --> 12:37.071
I ain't out of the woods yet,
but he did say

12:37.090 --> 12:39.406
I could go back to desk duty.

12:39.501 --> 12:42.427
Which sounds about
as tedious as radiation.

12:42.654 --> 12:45.412
Well, not necessarily.

12:45.507 --> 12:48.825
In fact, I did just
have a conversation

12:48.843 --> 12:51.844
with the deputy chief
that was, uh...

12:51.997 --> 12:54.397
pretty stunning.

12:55.758 --> 12:57.834
He's retiring.

12:57.852 --> 13:00.278
And he wants me to take the job.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.339
Well.

13:03.432 --> 13:06.192
Your own perch
on Mount Olympus, huh?

13:06.344 --> 13:08.027
How's that make you feel?

13:08.179 --> 13:10.437
Conflicted.

13:10.532 --> 13:12.698
Yeah, imagine it would.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.501
Why do you say that?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.702
Come on, New York.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.354
Guys like you and me?

13:18.373 --> 13:19.947
We're meant to be
down on the field,

13:19.966 --> 13:21.800
not up in the front office.

13:22.027 --> 13:23.376
Look, I don't have any interest
in being the last guy

13:23.528 --> 13:24.618
in the game.

13:24.712 --> 13:26.304
Worked out pretty good
for Tom Brady last year.

13:26.455 --> 13:28.047
Yeah, well, for every Tom Brady,

13:28.199 --> 13:30.366
there's a bunch of Brett Favres,
you know?

13:30.385 --> 13:32.218
Hobbling around,
way past their prime.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.038
Look, I would just rather
walk off the field

13:35.131 --> 13:36.981
than be carried off.

13:38.376 --> 13:41.152
Why does it seem like you
walked off the field already?

13:41.304 --> 13:43.988
'Cause I sort of have.

13:44.140 --> 13:47.641
Hey, 126 will rise again.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.977
When?
I've seen the red tape.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.072
But, so, maybe, I take this job,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.241
cut through the red tape,
open the firehouse

13:55.335 --> 13:57.743
and bring my people back.

13:57.896 --> 13:59.078
Without you there.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.897
Could be the perfect time
to leave,

14:00.915 --> 14:03.157
because I wouldn't be leaving.

14:03.251 --> 14:05.902
You just wouldn't be going back.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.388
Painless.

14:09.257 --> 14:11.266
Uh-huh.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.677

14:23.697 --> 14:26.606

Oh, stop, stop, stop.

14:34.949 --> 14:36.541
Thank you, guys.
I appreciate it.

14:36.692 --> 14:38.543
Y'all, uh...
You didn't have to do this.

14:38.694 --> 14:40.527

we wouldn't celebrate

14:40.547 --> 14:42.547

you don't know us very well.

14:42.698 --> 14:45.124
Aw, Bree. Well,
y'all gonna have to help me

14:45.218 --> 14:46.533

14:46.553 --> 14:48.778

pineapple.

14:48.796 --> 14:50.630

-White chocolate pineapple.

14:50.724 --> 14:54.541

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.881

yeah, we missed you, Grace.

You know, the place
wasn't the same without you.

He's right.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.553
It's been a long six weeks.

15:06.648 --> 15:10.283
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's been longer for me.

40:15.730 --> 40:16.913
We're doing good.

40:17.140 --> 40:18.063
BOTH:
Carlos!

Miss Tommy,

this mean you change your mind?

The girls wouldn't

I have no idea
how we're gonna make this work,

JUDD:
Well, Cap,

41:16.308 --> 41:19.792
looks like the boys
pulled through.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.561
They sure did.

41:25.208 --> 41:26.390
JUDD:
Hey, what do you say, Billy?

41:26.485 --> 41:28.710
I thought you had, uh,
that meeting or whatever.

41:28.728 --> 41:29.819
Yeah, we finished early.

41:30.046 --> 41:31.303
OWEN:
Good. Well,
welcome to the party.

41:31.397 --> 41:33.472
You're a little
overdressed, there, Cap.

41:33.566 --> 41:35.641
Well, as it turns out,

41:35.660 --> 41:37.735
I'm not gonna be a captain
for much longer.

41:37.887 --> 41:40.905
Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me
they shut down your firehouse.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.481
Not exactly.
Uh...

41:42.501 --> 41:44.392
Hey, everyone, can you hold
the work for a second?

41:44.410 --> 41:47.545
Come on over.
I-I got something I need to say.

41:49.733 --> 41:51.232
I, uh...

41:51.251 --> 41:53.659
wanted y'all to be
the first to hear this,

41:53.678 --> 41:55.494
direct from me.

41:55.514 --> 41:58.848
As soon as Deputy Chief
Radford's retirement

41:59.000 --> 42:01.333
is official,

42:01.353 --> 42:04.020
I'm gonna be Austin's
new deputy chief.

42:04.171 --> 42:05.930
TOMMY:
Hey, that's amazing.

42:06.082 --> 42:07.248
-Congratulations, Billy.
-TOMMY: Yeah.

42:07.267 --> 42:10.768
Thank you.
I think everybody here knows

42:10.920 --> 42:13.696
that I consider
this firehouse to be

42:13.923 --> 42:15.180
sacred ground.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.592
I want y'all to know--
each and every one of you--

42:17.610 --> 42:20.036
you have lived up
to the great legacy

42:20.187 --> 42:21.520
of these fine men.

42:21.540 --> 42:25.783
That's about the highest
compliment I could ever pay you.

42:25.935 --> 42:27.268
Which...

42:27.361 --> 42:30.362
makes this next part so hard.

42:31.532 --> 42:33.441
There's no reason to continue
what you're doing here today.

42:33.534 --> 42:37.428
We're shutting down the 126.
Permanently.

42:39.558 --> 42:42.225
This department is headed
for a financial crisis.

42:42.376 --> 42:44.635
I just read
a very persuasive report

42:44.788 --> 42:46.971
that says there's gonna be
dire consequences

42:47.065 --> 42:49.123
if we don't start
making the hard choices.

42:49.142 --> 42:51.309
I wrote that report.

42:51.403 --> 42:52.810
Yes, you did.

42:53.572 --> 42:58.232
Wait, so we're never
getting back together?

42:59.244 --> 43:02.987
I understand
it is a painful sacrifice.

43:03.081 --> 43:06.291
But it is for the greater good.

43:07.401 --> 43:09.919
But you're not deputy chief yet,
are you?

43:10.146 --> 43:12.496
No, not yet.

43:12.649 --> 43:14.424
Good.
