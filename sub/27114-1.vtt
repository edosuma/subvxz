{\an7}Last week, we did talk
a little bit about how the
dynamics of the relationship

12:34.120 --> 12:38.257
{\an4}had changed because
of the addiction and what
we wanted to talk about

12:38.324 --> 12:42.428
{\an1}is him transitioning now
into being clean and sober.

12:42.495 --> 12:46.365
{\an8}You know, I was kind of
dabbling with the pills
and stuff like that.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.069
{\an8}I had been drinking,
like, a cough syrup.
We call it, like, lean.

12:50.136 --> 12:53.639
The hip hop industry I was in
just made it a cool thing,

12:53.706 --> 12:59.445
{\an5}and I had a lot of teeth
problems and I was prescribed
Percocets from the doctor.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.547
I kind of started
abusing that.

13:01.614 --> 13:06.051
{\an1}Well, are there
any fears of relapse?

13:06.118 --> 13:09.321
{\an5}You know what you
kinda gotta go through,
the whole withdrawal thing,

13:09.388 --> 13:11.457
and I don't ever want to
go through that again.

13:13.826 --> 13:17.263

your head, Kim?

13:13.826 --> 13:17.263

I've been here for nine
mother(bleep) years, nine,

13:20.733 --> 13:27.473
{\an4}and I know you know I done
been through a lot of stuff
with you in this relationship.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.375
If it's not infidelity,
it's the drugs.

13:29.441 --> 13:30.876
If it's not the drugs,
it's disrespect.

13:30.943 --> 13:34.680
{\an1}If it's not disrespect,
it's all kinds of other stuff.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.616
{\an5}You know, it wasn't
something that I was
trying to do to hurt you.

13:37.683 --> 13:43.155
It was just something that
I got caught up in doing.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.592
{\an5}I really sat there
and watched you dig
yourself into a hole

13:46.659 --> 13:50.262
and I couldn't do nothing.
(sniffles)

13:50.329 --> 13:52.565
But it had nothing to do with
you, so I don't want you

13:52.631 --> 13:56.235
to put that burden,
like, on yourself at all.

13:56.302 --> 14:02.808
So I am truly sorry
for everything.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.743
I hope you forgive me.

14:07.146 --> 14:12.952
{\an5}For a time, I really felt
like I lost Juelz, and now
that he's finally clean,

14:13.018 --> 14:16.188
I still don't have him back
because of this case.

14:16.255 --> 14:21.260
{\an4}You know for a fact that I'm
always gonna be here for you
no matter what.

I just want things
to get better.

14:24.863 --> 14:31.537

broken and now having to put all
those pieces back together,

I was caught up in a big circus
because of my ex in L.A.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.471
...my man for two years
and had a baby with him.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.741
{\an4}They really hate me
'cause I'm make their
life a living hell.

15:08.807 --> 15:12.077
{\an5}But since then, me and
my ex Fetty had our
beautiful baby girl Alaiya.

15:12.144 --> 15:16.649
{\an5}She is now 10 months old
and now I'm back in my

15:19.618 --> 15:22.788
{\an5}Now that I have my
daughter, I need something
to channel my emotions

15:22.855 --> 15:25.057

became my therapy

was just playing my music
and she's like, yo,

15:35.234 --> 15:38.103
{\an5}I'm about to send your
song to Tr3way. I'm like,
"No! What the hell?!"

15:38.170 --> 15:40.139

We signed this paperwork.

16:04.029 --> 16:07.299

16:07.366 --> 16:09.668
I just feel like I'm new
to the music industry,

16:09.735 --> 16:11.470
so I just want to be
taken seriously

16:11.537 --> 16:14.707

16:14.773 --> 16:16.709

16:16.775 --> 16:19.211
I'm really trying to be
like a female 6ix9ine.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.180
{\an1}You're beautiful,
you're sexy,

16:21.246 --> 16:23.015
{\an1}and you're talented
when it comes to the music.

16:23.082 --> 16:26.285
{\an5}I've dabbled in music in the
past, but it wasn't really
something

16:26.352 --> 16:30.055
{\an5}I put a lot of energy into
and, you know, making a little
corny disc track

16:30.122 --> 16:32.524
is different than actually
making a real song.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.594
{\an5}I know you took a chance
by coming from... moving
from Atlanta to New York.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.463
I took a big chance
and a risk.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.732
I feel like I left
my whole life in Atlanta.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.967
I have a daughter.
I'm a single mother.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.136
So the time that I'm
taking away from her,

16:44.203 --> 16:46.839
{\an1}I need to make sure that
it's utilized the right way.

16:46.905 --> 16:52.378
{\an5}I had Alaiya at 23 weeks.
I had such a traumatic
emergency C-section.

16:52.444 --> 16:57.850
{\an5}Had seven blood transfusions
having her, so both of us
literally almost lost our lives.

16:57.916 --> 17:01.954
{\an5}The most important thing
is just being strong,
'cause if I'm not strong,

17:02.020 --> 17:06.692
then I can't, you know,
be strong for her.

17:06.759 --> 17:11.997
{\an5}She had four brain surgeries.
She's still here, strong,
laughing, crawling, giggling.

17:12.064 --> 17:15.634
{\an5}You wouldn't even know.
My daughter literally
is a miracle baby.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.770
{\an1}I just want to make sure
that I'm the main priority.

17:17.836 --> 17:20.271
{\an5}You being a priority
is gonna be dependent
on how hard you work.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.541
{\an4}The work you put in
is the work you get out.
Like, it's just that simple.

17:23.608 --> 17:27.746
{\an4}So there are a few things
I'd like to go into
in depth a little more.

17:27.813 --> 17:31.283
{\an1}You know, the working
relationship with Fetty,

17:31.350 --> 17:33.852
{\an4}would that affect
you in any way?
Can you handle that?

17:33.919 --> 17:36.455
I'm focused on Alexis.
It's not about Fetty.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.424
To me, honestly,
I don't see him.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.025
{\an1}How are you guys'
relationship to this point?

17:40.092 --> 17:43.328
There's unfinished
business between us.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.730
He has to handle
certain things.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.965
{\an1}So you're telling me now that
your personal relationship

17:47.032 --> 17:48.967
{\an1}might intervene in
my business relationship?

17:49.034 --> 17:52.237
{\an5}No, it is,
until it's handled.

17:49.034 --> 17:52.237
Until it's handled.

17:52.304 --> 17:54.373
You have me and him on
the same label, so...

17:54.440 --> 17:56.542
{\an5}(Alexis)
As amazing as my
beautiful daughter is,

17:56.608 --> 17:59.945
I'm still dealing with Fetty
not claiming her,

18:00.012 --> 18:01.547
nor does he
want to take a test,

18:01.613 --> 18:03.916
so I'm at a point
where I'm a single mom,

18:03.982 --> 18:07.653
{\an5}taking care of a little girl
that fought for her life
with no father.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.655
{\an5}I understand money
is money, business
is business,

18:09.721 --> 18:13.091
{\an5}but at the end of the day,
my daughter comes before
all of this.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.560
{\an1}I hear where you're
coming from 100%.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.395
{\an1}I just want to be on
the same page with you.

18:16.462 --> 18:19.865
{\an4}When it comes to
Tr3way business, if
there was an issue,

18:19.932 --> 18:23.635
{\an5}outside of the office,
right? And you guys
came into the office,

18:23.702 --> 18:27.706
{\an4}that issue should be put
on hold until you guys go back
outside is what I'm asking.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.175
{\an1}So, you're shaking
your head, saying no.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.045
{\an5}No, I just don't know
if I could keep
that composure.

18:33.111 --> 18:34.913
{\an1}This is a necessity.
You have to.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.815
We have to come to some
sort of understanding.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.151
{\an5}Well, that's something
you and him might
have to come up with,

18:39.218 --> 18:40.719

hours, lost how much blood?

20:19.618 --> 20:22.988

Right, so, like...

20:30.429 --> 20:36.234
{\an7}But that's how I feel because
I know how you are with your
other kids, so it's like...

20:36.301 --> 20:40.839
{\an4}There's stuff that needs
to be handled.

20:36.301 --> 20:40.839
We gonna handle that.

Daddy gonna come back home, no.

want to take no plea,
'cause I'm innocent,
