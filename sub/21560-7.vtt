11:38.331 --> 11:41.201
Um...

11:41.234 --> 11:43.170
how are the meetings
going?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.905
[Sighs]

11:44.938 --> 11:48.075
I toggle between
boredom and horror.

11:48.108 --> 11:51.945
Someone shared a story about
narcotic-induced constipation

11:51.979 --> 11:53.947
that I will never
be able to un-hear.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.315
Mmm.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.885
Yeah, I'll just be happy
when it's all over.

11:59.352 --> 12:04.357
Oh, and as a lovely
humiliation coda...

12:04.391 --> 12:06.726
I got kicked off Rover.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.262
Shut up.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.331
What happened?

12:11.364 --> 12:13.200
Oh, just everything.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.136
Cam, Bos, Diane --

12:16.169 --> 12:19.406
it was a perfect storm
of awful.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.441
Well, I'm sorry.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.144
I mean, at least we're not
direct competitors anymore.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.946
Hey.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.548
It'll make it a lot easier
when Comet kicks Rover's ass.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.217
[Scoffs]

12:30.250 --> 12:33.120
Oh, yeah? What makes you think
that's ever gonna happen?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.421
Well, we're doing
pretty well.

12:34.454 --> 12:35.856
About to launch
a big marketing push.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.224
Do you know what
your user numbers are?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.192
Yeah.
We got 50,000 hits a day.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.760
Rover's doing twice that.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.164
The average user finds
what they're looking for

12:44.197 --> 12:45.899
in 35 seconds.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.002
That's impressive.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.503
Yeah, it is.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.406
But it's also
what makes it vulnerable.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.375
What do you mean?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.177
I'm not convinced
this fight gets won

12:57.210 --> 12:59.012
by the site that keeps
traffic moving.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.414
I think it might go to the one
that keeps users around.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.517
Oh, look,
it makes so much sense.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.520
Why are we working so hard
to become the fastest site

13:07.554 --> 13:09.122
when we could become the...

13:09.156 --> 13:10.457
the stickiest?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.359
If we can keep users
hanging around,

13:12.392 --> 13:14.394
then we can start locking in
advertisers.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.030
But the whole point is to
deliver them to other sites.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.531
No, but we could
still do that.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.268
But it could also be
a destination in itself.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.904
Look, a-according to Donna,
we're not even close.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.073
-Whoa, whoa! Donna?
-Yeah.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.041
What does she have to
do with anything?

13:28.075 --> 13:30.110
Nothing. She stopped by this
morning, and we got to --

13:30.143 --> 13:31.444
No, no.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.546
We're not taking
business advice from Donna.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.516
Who cares where it comes from
if it's a good idea?

13:36.549 --> 13:38.285
She's our direct competition.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.954
Why would we listen
to what she has to say?

13:40.988 --> 13:43.623
Because she's a really
well-informed player

13:43.656 --> 13:45.158
in the field.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.593
We're not gonna
be derailed by Donna.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.461
We're gonna move forward
with this marketing plan,

13:48.495 --> 13:50.230
and I'm really excited about
what they're --

13:50.263 --> 13:52.465
What's the point in coming up
with a marketing plan

13:52.499 --> 13:54.902
when we're gonna end up
redesigning the whole site?

13:54.935 --> 13:57.404
Because we are not going to
redesign the whole site.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.339
Hey, I'm really sorry
to interrupt,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.108
but we are freezing
out there.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.943
I don't know what
that guy did yesterday,

14:02.976 --> 14:05.112
but I think he's trying to
cryogenically preserve us.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.480
[ Indistinct talking ]

14:10.050 --> 14:13.053
The average visit to Rover
takes 30 seconds, okay?

14:13.086 --> 14:15.956
Whereas the average visit to us
takes well over a minute.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.524
I don't trust that data.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.093
You're being ridiculous.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.129
Are you sleeping
with her again?

14:22.162 --> 14:24.264
Am I sleeping
with my ex-wife?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.465
Yeah.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.634
We're going at it
like rabbits.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.904
And Katie...

14:30.938 --> 14:32.439
she's cool with it.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.374
Been spending a lot of time
together.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.409
Much more than usual.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.212
She's the mother of my children.
We see each other.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.581
I shouldn't even have told you
the idea came from her.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.583
Then you would have thought
it was a great idea.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.119
But it did come from her, and
I'm not taking business advice

14:46.153 --> 14:47.387
from someone who's goal

14:47.420 --> 14:49.122
is to dance on the carcass
of my company.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.558
Okay, come on.
She's not that bad.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.426
Besides,
she's not even...

14:53.460 --> 14:55.062
Look, she's...

14:55.095 --> 14:56.997
she's in a different place now,
all right?

14:57.030 --> 14:58.531
She has other things
to worry about.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.533
Besides, her daughter works
here, for Christ's sake!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.369
You really think she's
gonna go out of her way

15:02.402 --> 15:04.471
to try and destroy a company
that her daughter works at?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.573
But her daughter
doesn't work here anymore.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.541
Now is the perfect time
for her to strike.

massive from Tiffany's.

-Oh, it's...
-You shouldn't have.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.257
Oh. Hey!

15:57.290 --> 15:58.591
What?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.627
I didn't know Tiffany's
made a box that big.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.330

congratulations.

I'm so happy for you.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.712
Well, we really only did it
for tax reasons.

Yeah, on account of me
almost dying.

Oh, I don't know.
You pledged your troths.

keep telling us.

a minute with Donna --

it's a punch bowl, I --

Oh! Punch bowl.

Oh, sweetheart, where do
we keep our punch bowls?

Put it in the pantry.
I'll take care of it.
Okay.

Or you can just put it right
in the back of Diana's car

so she can exchange it
for a nice piece of jewelry.

[Chuckles]

17:04.724 --> 17:07.160
Donna...

17:07.194 --> 17:10.330
first of all,
I owe you an apology.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.798
I was...

17:11.831 --> 17:14.534
rough about Rover.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.469
No, look,
no apology necessary.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.704
It was a...

17:17.737 --> 17:19.572
complex situation.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.441
Water under the bridge.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.078

that I'm getting ready to step
back as managing partner.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.450
Really?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.419
We got the message
loud and clear

17:32.452 --> 17:34.154
about not living forever.

17:34.187 --> 17:38.191
And if I want to spend time
with my new husband...

17:38.225 --> 17:41.228
managing partner is
not a part-time job.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.333
When were you thinking
about doing this?

17:46.366 --> 17:48.435
Soon-ish.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.171
[Sighs]

17:51.204 --> 17:54.441
I wanted to let you know that
if you still want the job...

17:54.474 --> 17:56.409
I'll back you.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.411
Oh, I...

18:00.347 --> 18:01.781
Of course.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.183
I do.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.517
Good.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.487
I mean,
I can't just anoint you.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.821
No, of course.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.224
But I do have a pretty
jumbo-sized vote.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.092
[Laughs]

18:14.927 --> 18:17.464
Thank you.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.732
Should we celebrate?
Some champagne, gin?

18:19.766 --> 18:23.436
You know, just water
would be great.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.272
Okay.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.912
Sorry, I know it's a little
insane in here, but...

18:32.945 --> 18:35.348
Ah. No, no, it's ---
it's perfect.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.749
I didn't know
what to expect

18:36.783 --> 18:38.385
when I heard
"trailer in the woods."

18:38.418 --> 18:40.153
-Yeah.
-Ha.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.921
I feel like I just
walked into your brain.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.691
Oh, no, my brain is
not as tidy as this.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.725
Do you want to see?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.827
-Of course.
-Okay.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.330
So it's all still
pretty basic,

18:50.363 --> 18:52.632
but what I've been
trying to do

18:52.665 --> 18:56.336
is create bots
with distinct personalities

18:56.369 --> 18:58.605
and whose choices
change depending on --

18:58.638 --> 19:00.573
on the circumstances
they're in.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.742
-Self-learning A.I.
-Exactly.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.178
So it's not just the player
acting upon the game,

19:05.212 --> 19:06.679
it's the game acting
upon itself

19:06.713 --> 19:08.748
and then the player has to try
and catch up.

19:08.781 --> 19:13.620
So this is Bing and Billie,

19:13.653 --> 19:15.588
and this is Gazebo.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.291
I have a bunch, but these
are kind of the main three.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.328
What I'm really trying to do
is create a world

19:21.361 --> 19:24.297
in which actions have
consequences, you know?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.866
Mm-hmm.
I mean, I was trying
to do that with Pilgrim, too,

19:26.899 --> 19:28.801
but I guess
that game was too...

19:28.835 --> 19:31.904
solitary or hard
or whatever.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.442
But, um, here, I feel
like I'm creating characters

19:35.475 --> 19:39.246
that have the ability to accrue
memory and -- and -- and --

19:39.279 --> 19:43.816
and develop a personal narrative
and -- and change over time.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.619
And it's all just
feeling really...

19:46.653 --> 19:49.789
immersive and complete.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.726
-Really great.
-Yeah.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.297
I mean, I was expecting great,
so I'm not surprised.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.333
So do you want to see some of
the more, um, in-progress work?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.269
Um...sure.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.237
Or maybe we could go
for a little hike,

20:04.271 --> 20:05.438
talk more big-picture.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.939
It's just so gorgeous
out here.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.508
Um...

20:08.541 --> 20:09.676
[Chuckles]

20:09.709 --> 20:11.344
Okay.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.447
So it wasn't really what you
were looking for?

20:14.481 --> 20:16.683
Oh! No, no.
It's just...

20:16.716 --> 20:19.018
sometimes I think
the ideas can get bigger

20:19.051 --> 20:20.920
when the space
around you does.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.755
Yeah.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.592
Yes. Let's...

20:25.625 --> 20:27.727
I've been trying to get out
for a hike all day.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.329
Let's --
Let's get out there.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.839
Joe:
We can call a guy.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.275
I already called a guy,
he made it worse.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.543
So did you.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.747
Look, it's a bad breaker.
I can fix that.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.749
It's more
than a bad breaker.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.285
You sure you don't
want to call a guy?

20:52.319 --> 20:54.854
You guys,
this is not rocket science.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.656
Okay.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.326
Thanks for
the afternoon off.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.994
I didn't give you
the afternoon off.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.996
You're supposed to be
working from home.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.832
Oh.
What did I say?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.900
All right,
I'll see you tonight.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.436
Can I bring anything?

21:09.469 --> 21:10.803
Nope.
Got all that covered.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.606
Oh. You're a take-charge
mama jama.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.941
Mm-hmm.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.444
Try not
to blow anything up.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.978
I'll try.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.849
Cam said Donna
was looking pretty rough

21:22.882 --> 21:24.784
when she came by
the Airstream last week.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.419
Is something
going on with her?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.490
Cameron said she didn't seem
like herself.

21:30.523 --> 21:33.059
Why is Cam
gossiping about Donna?

21:33.092 --> 21:34.894
She was concerned.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.930
Look, I just don't
trust the woman.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.499
I know she's your family,

21:39.532 --> 21:41.568
I'm not supposed to have
an opinion about her,

21:41.601 --> 21:42.769
but I don't trust her.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.705
Haley cut all
of her hair off, okay?

21:45.738 --> 21:48.107
Short. Like a boy.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.545
Donna came over this morning
to talk about it, except...

21:56.816 --> 21:59.419
Well, short hair...

21:59.452 --> 22:01.554
doesn't mean anything.

22:01.588 --> 22:02.922
Um...

22:02.955 --> 22:04.591
Well...

22:04.624 --> 22:07.927
apparently, I shouldn't have
barked at you the other day.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.365
But it's really tough hearing
something about your kid

22:12.399 --> 22:14.401
that you don't know about.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.139
Can I make one suggestion?

22:20.172 --> 22:25.912
It's really important for Haley
not to feel isolated right now.

22:25.945 --> 22:29.382
This place
is such a great fit for her.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.485
I wish you'd let her come back.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.455
I want her to,
but she seems pretty intent

22:35.488 --> 22:36.989
on hating me right now.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.660
[Sighs]

22:42.161 --> 22:43.896
She trusts you, though.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.698
Hmm?

22:45.732 --> 22:49.769
I mean, she took you to that
restaurant, didn't she?

Haley, Joe MacMillan.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.062
Oh, my dad's
not here today.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.064
Actually, I'm calling
to speak to you.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.666
Oh.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.034
I hear you're not interested
in coming back to Comet,

23:22.068 --> 23:23.636
and that really
bums me out.

23:23.670 --> 23:24.804
It bums me out, too.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.972
So come back.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.874
I don't think
that's a good idea.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.443
Of course it is.
We need you.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.011
I don't know.
I -- I just...

23:32.044 --> 23:33.613
What?

23:33.646 --> 23:36.115
I just don't think I should be
working for my dad --

23:36.148 --> 23:39.051
or with him, or whatever
that arrangement was.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.621
Look, nobody knows
better than me

23:41.654 --> 23:44.657
how impossible working
with your father is.

23:44.691 --> 23:47.860
He's moody, impatient,
ungrateful,

23:47.894 --> 23:51.664
and the know-it-all problem
is legendary.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.165
He's standing right there,
isn't he?

23:53.199 --> 23:55.802
Would I be saying all this
if he were standing right here?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.203
Yeah. [ Laughs ]

23:57.236 --> 23:58.805
Okay, so you answered
your own question.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.640
You're part of this place.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.008
And we need you.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.710
Did my dad hear that?

24:03.743 --> 24:05.111
Yes, he did.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.679
And he knows it's true.

24:09.081 --> 24:12.251
Tell him
I'll see him tonight.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.920
I'm gonna take that
as a yes

24:13.953 --> 24:15.187
and inform the Potstickers.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.023
We'll see.

24:26.265 --> 24:29.001
What, did she say that
in a -- in a nice way,

24:29.035 --> 24:30.670
or like a threatening way?

24:30.703 --> 24:32.071
Nice.

not coming out at all.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.617
-It's fine.
-It's not fine, Joe.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.287
Don't get me wrong, the bot
technology is impressive.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.757
But Blizzard is already
doing something similar,

24:50.790 --> 24:51.958
and so is Origin.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.761
And I can totally
compete in that arena.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.028
But what about

24:56.062 --> 24:57.964
an entirely
different arena?

24:57.997 --> 25:01.968
What if your software was used
on the surface of Mars?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.836
Or in the human
bloodstream?

25:03.870 --> 25:07.173
What if Gazebo could be used
to defend the immune system?

25:07.206 --> 25:08.808
You know
just as well as I do

25:08.841 --> 25:10.309
the technology
you're working on

25:10.342 --> 25:12.244
isn't going to just
live inside a game.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.046
Yeah, and that's...

25:14.080 --> 25:15.915
a very easy thing to say.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.884
But I've been working on games
for a long ti--

25:17.917 --> 25:19.251
No, I don't mean
to pretend

25:19.285 --> 25:21.053
that I know what
it's all gonna look like.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.158
Can I ask you
a personal question?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.527
Yes.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.531
What's the deal
with you and Donna Emerson?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.703
Things seemed pretty prickly
at M.I.S.C.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.938
I know you two worked together
on "Mutiny."

25:38.971 --> 25:40.607
We did.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.242
So what happened?

25:46.746 --> 25:49.315
We didn't share the same vision
for our company.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.317
Ah.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.086
Did she try to push you
out of your comfort zone?

-Um...

of turning a weakness
into a strength.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.305
You know, in my interviews,
I'm finding that people

27:19.338 --> 27:21.173
are mostly just scared
of the Web.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.209
They're afraid
they'll get lost in it.

we'll give them shelter.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.246
I mean, the end game
doesn't have to be

27:27.279 --> 27:29.148
to get wrapped up
in some software package.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.250
It can be to make Comet
a home on the Internet.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.920
What if we took an aggregate
of the top searches.

27:33.953 --> 27:36.355
When Kurt Cobain died,
we were flooded with searches.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.224
How amazing would it
have been if...

27:38.257 --> 27:41.828
if we had a little write-up
about it on the top of the page.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.229
Yeah.
That would have been great.

is interested in them.

into this tomorrow?

in launching into something,

get out of here in 15?

tonight?

are going to the movies,

to spare, but...

Okay, well, first of all,
I'm not on Rover anymore,

32:57.743 --> 32:59.578
so I'm not
your competition.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.480
And, secondly --
-What are you talking about?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.015
You just came over
to get Cameron

33:03.049 --> 33:04.316
to sign away
the algorithm.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.118
What can I tell you, Joe?

33:06.152 --> 33:07.786
Shit changes fast.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.589
If you're off the project,
how did you get those numbers?

33:10.622 --> 33:12.058
Are they even real?

33:12.091 --> 33:13.425
[Chuckles]
Wow!

33:13.459 --> 33:17.229
The old Joe MacMillan ego,
just, I mean, volcanic.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.331
What do you think?
I -- I...

33:19.365 --> 33:23.269
I have time to just sit around
and, what, plot against you?

33:23.302 --> 33:24.703
Wouldn't be
the first time.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.606
I promise you I don't give
a shit about your company.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.808
The only reason I ever even
cared a little bit

33:29.841 --> 33:31.677
was 'cause my daughter
worked there,

33:31.710 --> 33:33.212
and now that's not even true.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.381
So, really, I give it
just no thought at all.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.250
Actually, Haley
does still work there.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.419
I spoke to her
this afternoon.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.221
Did you?

33:42.254 --> 33:43.722
Yeah.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.358
She happens to be someone
I care about very much.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.694
Oh, well, lucky her
'cause she's so bereft

33:48.727 --> 33:51.297
of people that care about her.
-Donna, look!

33:51.330 --> 33:53.532
Gordon and I are getting started
on a new idea

33:53.565 --> 33:55.334
that sprang
from a whiff of a hint

33:55.367 --> 33:56.835
of a nothing comment
you made,

33:56.868 --> 33:59.538
and I just want to be sure --
human to human --

33:59.571 --> 34:02.108
that you're not planning to do
something to screw us.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.810
Jesus Christ! What kind of
person do you think I am?

34:04.843 --> 34:07.646
You tried to get me kicked off
the browser project.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.615
You stole our idea
for the Web index,

34:09.648 --> 34:11.717
and those are just
the California crimes.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.419
Don't get me started
on Texas.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.287
Okay, you know what?
You're right.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.256
I am not
a trustworthy person.

34:17.289 --> 34:20.426
The best thing you can do
is to leave me the hell alone.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.861
Believe me,
nothing would make me happier.

34:22.894 --> 34:26.532
Unfortunately --
-Jesus Christ, you won!

34:26.565 --> 34:28.267
Okay, you won!

34:28.300 --> 34:31.770
You got Haley
and Gordon and Cam.

34:31.803 --> 34:34.773
You got everybody.
What more do you want from me?

34:34.806 --> 34:36.342
-Ow!
-[ Gasps ]

34:37.576 --> 34:39.411
Oh, my God!
[Gasps]

34:46.218 --> 34:48.154
Sure they're not broken?

34:50.689 --> 34:52.591
I'm pretty sure.

34:52.624 --> 34:55.194
[Ice crackling]

34:58.930 --> 35:03.402
Level with me.
How come you're off Rover?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.473
Oh, it's a long story.

35:07.506 --> 35:10.209
But the short version...

35:10.242 --> 35:12.878
it wasn't up to me.
-Hmm.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.116
Sorry I got in your face.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.787
I don't think
I deserved this.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.422
[Sighs]

35:25.924 --> 35:28.327
You have to know
I didn't do that on purpose.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.761
Donna, come on.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.164
Of course I do.

35:32.198 --> 35:35.401
And I would never do anything
to interfere with Comet, really.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.237
I'm not that person.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.839
Even if Haley
weren't there, I...

35:40.872 --> 35:43.942
I just, I wouldn't.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.411
Mm-hmm.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.184
Donna, I get it.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.887
It hurts to be thought of
in that way.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.626
I've been there.

Mm-hmm.

gonna tell people?

39:13.118 --> 39:15.454

a very civilized hour with.

out civilized, but...
