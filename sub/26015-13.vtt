of areas to the snake

28:00.470 --> 28:01.471

an illustrational design

28:28.123 --> 28:29.707

I'm leaning to TeeJ.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.670
just because it did have
an overall more finished feel.

28:33.753 --> 28:37.632

I did what I needed to do.
I got in and out.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.545

35:04.185 --> 35:08.981

35:09.065 --> 35:10.566
That's it. Machines down.
Time is up.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.693
No more ink.

We are all done.

35:18.115 --> 35:19.867

You need to do this more often

35:19.951 --> 35:21.494

35:21.577 --> 35:22.745
- I ain't gonna stop

35:22.829 --> 35:24.121

35:24.205 --> 35:27.250

a bunch of flowers.

- Exactly.

{\an1}- Because when
all three people do

35:33.631 --> 35:35.091
a solid-ass tattoo,

35:35.174 --> 35:37.218
{\an1}you do not want
to have to debate.

35:37.301 --> 35:38.219
{\an3}- Exactly.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.769
- Today, you had to fight
against your own teammates

to stay in this competition.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.441
Based on your work, one of you
will be packing your machines.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.319
Tim, let's start with you.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.657
- You made a really smart
choice on the flower.

35:59.740 --> 36:03.244
<i>It has a lot of contrast, even</i>
<i>though they're the same color,</i>

36:03.327 --> 36:05.163
<i>same three kind of flowers,</i>
<i>same tones.</i>

36:05.246 --> 36:07.540
<i>You still have definition</i>
<i>where each petal</i>

36:07.623 --> 36:09.584
<i>of each flower</i>
<i>stops and starts.</i>

36:09.667 --> 36:11.460
- You captured a really nice
highlight

36:11.544 --> 36:12.920
of the internal section

36:13.004 --> 36:14.422
<i>of the flower</i>
<i>by using that skin.</i>

36:14.505 --> 36:16.132
<i>That makes your yellow</i>
<i>nice and bright,</i>

36:16.215 --> 36:18.259
<i>and you reached</i>
<i>for the right color.</i>

36:18.342 --> 36:20.678
<i>The dark, rich</i>
<i>school-bus yellow?</i>

36:20.761 --> 36:22.597
Strong.
You take the cake on this one.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.351
- Amanda.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.563
There is really nice detail

36:30.646 --> 36:32.315
<i>in the stems, and the leaves,</i>
<i>and the wrapping.</i>

36:32.398 --> 36:36.068
<i>In this front facing</i>
<i>orange flower,</i>

36:36.152 --> 36:37.486
<i>I like all the skin breaks</i>
<i>in there,</i>

36:37.570 --> 36:38.779
<i>making that thing breathe.</i>

36:38.863 --> 36:40.281
<i>Your use of outlines</i>
<i>really helps</i>

36:40.364 --> 36:41.574
bring these flowers forward.

36:41.657 --> 36:44.952
- From a distance, very clear
what it is, very bright.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.829
<i>But the red flower looks</i>
<i>a little muddy.</i>

36:46.913 --> 36:48.539
- It has almost more of a
camouflage, like, feel to it,

36:48.623 --> 36:52.043
like it's a dark tone, and
then you come off to a pink.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.086
It's just very harsh,
it's very abrupt.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.421
Overall , your color palette's
dynamic in your flowers,

36:55.504 --> 36:58.799
<i>but I don't think</i>
<i>the execution of the way</i>

36:58.883 --> 37:01.469
you put the color in hits
the realism challenge.

37:01.552 --> 37:05.014
It just doesn't have that
soft, photographic look to it.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.726
- Chris.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.145
- First look at this tattoo,
it's pretty slick.

37:11.228 --> 37:12.855
<i>The colors do stand vibrant.</i>

37:12.939 --> 37:15.775
<i>You've got some rich colors,</i>
<i>you've got some bright colors.</i>

37:15.858 --> 37:17.693
- The ribbon here is
the shining moment.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.070
<i>It stands out nicely.</i>

37:19.153 --> 37:21.322
- My only thing is that
it would not have

37:21.405 --> 37:22.490
bummed me out one bit
if you would've took-in it

37:22.573 --> 37:25.159
to a little bit darker tones
on the edges

37:25.242 --> 37:26.911
<i>just to create a border,</i>

37:26.994 --> 37:29.246
<i>so that this tattoo has</i>
<i>a little bit more strength.</i>

37:29.330 --> 37:31.332
- I didn't want to chew 'em up.
- Eh, that's horse[bleep].

37:31.415 --> 37:33.334
You think an outline's gonna
[bleep] chew him up?

37:33.417 --> 37:35.544
Give me a break.
It's not going for the win.

37:35.628 --> 37:36.629
That's my point.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.803
- I said the same thing, bro.

37:43.886 --> 37:44.720
- How the [bleep] am I supposed
to coach that?

37:45.805 --> 37:49.475
- Okay, judges. It's time to
determine who's going home.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.103
- Amanda's muddiness,
I don't know. I just--

37:52.186 --> 37:53.688
this red flower bums me out.
- Me too.

37:53.771 --> 37:54.981
- Amanda's, straight up
and down,

37:55.064 --> 37:56.190
you can tell exactly
what those are.

37:56.273 --> 37:57.692
- I mean, there's no doubt
about it.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.944
<i>Mine's three flowers</i>
<i>tied together with twine.</i>

38:00.027 --> 38:01.362
If it was ribbon day,
Chris takes it.

38:01.445 --> 38:04.281
Above the ribbon, though, it's
hard to see what's going on.

38:04.365 --> 38:05.908
- What was the ask today?

38:05.992 --> 38:06.909
It was a bouquet, right?

38:06.993 --> 38:10.037
{\an8}I see two bouquets
and some flowers.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.039
{\an8}<i>But I do not see</i>
<i>three bouquets,</i>

38:12.123 --> 38:13.416
{\an8}and we were asked to
do bouquets.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.626
{\an3}- A definition of bouquet is
a creative arrangement

38:15.710 --> 38:16.877
of flowers, period.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.422
<i>- That looks like</i>
<i>it's just one plant</i>

38:19.505 --> 38:20.715
<i>with three flowers</i>
<i>coming off it.</i>

38:20.798 --> 38:24.135
- I think it's bull[bleep].
Tim hits the bouquet.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.053
- You can read Tim's bouquet,

38:26.137 --> 38:27.221
<i>all separate flowers.</i>
<i>- From a distance</i>

38:27.304 --> 38:29.181
<i>and up close.</i>
<i>- So, in my opinion,</i>

38:29.265 --> 38:31.600
Tim's safe. What you think?
- I second that.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.813
- Good job, Tim.
- So, it is a tough call.

38:35.896 --> 38:37.315
It's between Chris and Amanda.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.942
{\an8}- I do like Amanda's more, just
because I can tell what it is.

38:40.026 --> 38:42.486
{\an8}<i>Chris's, the bottom part,</i>
<i>below the ribbon,</i>

38:42.570 --> 38:44.905
{\an8}<i>I'm not a fan, artistically,</i>
<i>how that looks.</i>

38:44.989 --> 38:45.740
<i>- Is it just one stem?</i>

38:45.823 --> 38:46.907
- I mean, that is interesting,

38:46.991 --> 38:49.493
because it's supposed
to be three flowers.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.746
<i>- From a distance,</i>
<i>Chris's could look like</i>

38:51.829 --> 38:53.914
<i>just one big, crazy,</i>
<i>elaborate flower.</i>

38:53.998 --> 38:56.417
Don't really see the definition
between all three flowers.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.419
- Especially with the stem
on Chris's.

38:58.502 --> 39:02.298
I would think that this
is one big crazy flower.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.925
- Amanda's, even
with her muddy peony,

39:05.009 --> 39:07.386
<i>that thing still holds</i>
<i>so much contrast.</i>

39:07.470 --> 39:08.971
I can't see Chris's tattoo.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.307
- I agree with you, TeeJ, that
Chris's is the hardest to read.

39:11.390 --> 39:14.268
- Exactly.
- My final decision

39:14.351 --> 39:15.811
to go home is for Chris.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.481
