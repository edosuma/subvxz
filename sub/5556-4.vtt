WEBVTT

00:01.320 --> 00:02.799
Did you see
that spaceship in the hangar?

00:03.160 --> 00:04.439
Yeah, we found
that on the lakebed.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.519
In here!

00:05.600 --> 00:06.759
Wait,
are they saying something?

00:06.840 --> 00:09.839
"The dark. The sword.
The forsaken. The temple."

00:09.920 --> 00:13.359
These words actually rewrite the
synaptic connections in your brain.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.559
They're coordinates.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.319
Someone is deliberately
getting people killed.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.359
They're turning them into transmitters.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.199
I can save you.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.279
A new ghost.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.399
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.239
So there's this man,
he has a time machine.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.879
Up and down history he goes,
zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.359
Getting into scrapes.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.079
Another thing he has

00:38.160 --> 00:43.919
is a passion for the works
of Ludwig van Beethoven.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.079
And one day he thinks, "What's the point
of having a time machine

00:47.160 --> 00:49.199
"if you don't get to meet your heroes?"

00:49.320 --> 00:52.759
So, off he goes to
18th-century Germany.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.119
But he can't find Beethoven anywhere.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.599
No one's heard of him.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.439
Not even his family have any idea

00:59.520 --> 01:01.919
who the time traveller
is talking about.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.359
Beethoven literally doesn't exist.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.199
This didn't happen, by the way.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.119
I've met Beethoven. Nice chap.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.359
Very intense. Loved an arm wrestle.

01:19.520 --> 01:24.359
No, this is called
the Bootstrap Paradox.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.239
Google it.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.839
The time traveller panics.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.959
He can't bear the thought of a world
without the music of Beethoven.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.759
Luckily, he brought all of his Beethoven
sheet music for Ludwig to sign.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.679
So he copies out
all the concertos and the symphonies

01:43.480 --> 01:45.839
and he gets them published.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.599
He becomes Beethoven.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.919
And history continues
with barely a feather ruffled.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.879
My question is this.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.719
Who put those notes
and phrases together?

02:05.840 --> 02:08.758
Who really composed Beethoven's Fifth?

02:55.880 --> 02:57.119
Where's Bennett?
We need to get going.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.719
Oh, he's still throwing up.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.279
One small step for man,
one giant...

03:01.800 --> 03:03.359
Time travel does that sometimes.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.039
I somehow doubt that
Rose, or Martha or Amy

03:05.120 --> 03:07.119
lost their breakfast on the first trip.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.879
You seem to know an awful lot about me.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.839
I used to be military intelligence.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.399
I was demoted for dangling
a colleague out a window.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.799
In anger?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.559
Is there another way to dangle
someone out the window?

03:22.800 --> 03:23.999
What year are we in?

03:28.160 --> 03:29.239
1980.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.519
So, pre-Harold Saxon,
pre-the Minister of War,

03:33.600 --> 03:35.519
pre-the moon exploding,
the big bat coming out...

03:35.600 --> 03:36.879
The Minister of War?

03:37.040 --> 03:39.039
- Yeah?
- No, never mind.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.999
I expect I'll find out soon enough.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.279
Sorry about that.
The prawn sandwich might have been off.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.479
Uh-huh.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.479
Uh, don't worry.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.199
Shall we go?

03:51.680 --> 03:54.199
Uh, just one sec.
I've just got something in my boot.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.199
It's bigger on the inside,
it's bigger on the inside,

04:00.280 --> 04:01.919
it's bigger on the inside!

04:02.000 --> 04:04.679
How can it be
bigger on the inside, Bennett?

04:07.520 --> 04:08.759
Okay, let's roll.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.839
Why have we gone to Russia?

04:13.920 --> 04:14.919
Uh, we haven't.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.839
We're still in Scotland.
This is the town before it flooded.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.079
The TARDIS has brought us to when
the spaceship first touched down.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.359
But here and now
it's the height of the Cold War.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.759
The military were being trained
for offensives on Soviet soil.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.839
Oh, is that the pilot?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.679
My God, look at the size of it.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.839
No, that's the body.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.319
What do you mean, "the body"?

04:55.600 --> 04:57.279
This isn't just any spaceship.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.399
It's a hearse.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.279
The suspended animation
chamber is still here,

05:02.360 --> 05:03.959
and the power cells for the engine.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.879
And there are no markings on the wall.

05:08.840 --> 05:09.999
Yet.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.039
Greetings!

05:12.600 --> 05:14.399
It's him. That's the ghost
from the Drum.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.799
Remarkable.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.919
And humans, too.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.599
Albar Prentis, Funeral Director.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.039
You're from Tivoli, aren't you?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.839
The most invaded
planet in the galaxy.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.199
Our capital city has a sign saying,

05:33.280 --> 05:36.519
"If you occupied us,
you'd be home by now."

05:36.600 --> 05:39.199
Yes, I've had dealings with your lot
before, I can't say I'm a fan.

05:39.280 --> 05:42.239
Oh, we do tend to antagonize.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.559
What are you doing here?

05:43.640 --> 05:44.719
Ah, yes. Of course.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.559
This is the Fisher King.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.319
He and his armies invaded Tivoli
and enslaved us for ten glorious years.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.759
Until we were
liberated by the Arcateenians.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.599
But, thank the gods,
soon we'd irritated them so much,

06:01.680 --> 06:03.239
they enslaved us, too.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.679
My first proper alien,
and he's an idiot.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.839
And now, in accordance with
Arcateenian custom,

06:10.440 --> 06:14.759
I've come to bury him
on a barren, savage outpost.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.359
You mean the town?

06:16.640 --> 06:17.639
He means the planet.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.399
Although, at the risk of starting
a bidding war, you could enslave me.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.479
In the ship,
I have directions to my planet

06:24.560 --> 06:27.799
and a selection of items
that you can appraise me with.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.959
Listen, we've come from the future,

06:29.040 --> 06:30.679
you're about to send
some sort of a signal.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.879
How do you do it? Is it a special pen?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.879
- What are you talking about?
- The technology you use.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.639
The thing that wrenches the soul
out of the body and makes it repeat

06:39.720 --> 06:41.199
your coordinates for eternity.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.159
Give it to me now,
I'm going to take the batteries out.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.599
We don't have anything
like that.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.119
Even this belongs to
the glorious Arcateenians.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.279
So who sends the message?

06:54.560 --> 06:56.999
Back to the TARDIS.
I need to talk to Clara.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.639
You've been here before.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.999
In situations like this before.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.119
Yeah, not exactly like, but...

07:25.880 --> 07:27.279
Yeah, once or twice.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.159
So you've had to deal with
people who are scared.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.159
What do you say to them?

07:31.960 --> 07:33.999
I'm asking what I should say to you.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.919
That it will be all right.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.839
That the Doctor will save us.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.279
And when you say it, do you believe it?

07:43.400 --> 07:45.559
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.479
And now?

07:50.840 --> 07:54.079
Cass thinks the Doctor's saying
something different to the others.

07:54.720 --> 08:00.199
He's saying, "Moran,
Pritchard, apprentice..."

08:00.280 --> 08:02.159
No... "Prentis"?

08:03.480 --> 08:09.239
"...O'Donnell, Clara,
Doctor, Bennett, Cass."

08:10.360 --> 08:11.799
It's just a list of all our names.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.959
And when he finishes, he just goes
back to the beginning again,

08:15.040 --> 08:16.119
over and over, that's it.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.279
Who's Prentis?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.959
- It's the Doctor.
- He's alive?

08:22.920 --> 08:23.999
For the moment.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.199
Doctor?
Doctor, are you all right?

08:28.680 --> 08:32.198
Yeah, fine. So listen,
the spaceship, it's a hearse.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.599
Clara, what's wrong?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.279
Another ghost has appeared.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.799
What? Who? Has someone died?

08:40.159 --> 08:42.839
Doctor, it's you.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.039
You okay?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.159
Yeah.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.199
Well, currently.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.999
What does it mean?

08:55.880 --> 08:56.959
It means I die.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.679
No, not necessarily, we can change
the sequence of events, so...

09:00.080 --> 09:01.999
This isn't the potential future.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.079
This is the future now.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.439
It's already happened.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.519
The proof is right there
in front of you.

09:16.960 --> 09:17.959
I have to die.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.959
No.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.519
You can change things.

09:22.680 --> 09:23.719
I can't.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.839
Even the tiniest change,
the ramifications could be catastrophic,

09:27.920 --> 09:30.519
could spread carnage
and chaos across the universe,

09:30.600 --> 09:32.439
like ripples on a pond.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.279
Oh, well, I've had a good innings.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.799
This regeneration,
it's a bit of a clerical error, anyway.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.999
Gotta go sometime.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.359
Not with me!

09:42.720 --> 09:45.279
Die with whoever comes after me,
you do not leave me!

09:47.120 --> 09:49.159
Clara, I need to talk to you
just on your own.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.719
Listen to me.

09:55.040 --> 09:59.439
We all have to face death eventually,
be it ours or someone else's.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.439
I'm not ready yet.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.239
I don't want to think
about that, not yet.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.159
I can't change what's already happened.
There are rules.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.519
So break them.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.759
And anyway, you owe me.

10:15.680 --> 10:20.839
You've made yourself essential to me,
you've given me something else to be.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.879
And you can't do that and then die,
it's not fair.

10:23.960 --> 10:24.959
Clara...

10:25.040 --> 10:28.319
No, Doctor, I don't care about your
rules or your bloody survivor's guilt,

10:28.400 --> 10:32.839
if you love me in any way,
you'll come back.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.759
Doctor, are you...

10:43.080 --> 10:45.079
I can't save Moran or Pritchard.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.079
I know. Like you said, if you can,

10:47.160 --> 10:48.799
if you can find out
why this is happening,

10:48.880 --> 10:50.839
then maybe you can stop them
killing anybody else.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.319
You can save us.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.279
And you can stop it happening to you.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.759
I'll do what I can,
but the future has already happened.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.719
We've just met the undertaker
and he's still alive.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.839
So, ghost me.
You've got a better view than me.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.759
How do I look?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.079
Any signs of trauma, any scars?

11:40.160 --> 11:42.679
- Any clues as to how I die?
- No.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.799
Nothing. You're the same
as all the other ghosts,

11:44.880 --> 11:46.119
with the weird black eyes and...

11:50.600 --> 11:52.479
No, no, wait.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.479
Your coat is torn on the right shoulder.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.679
I assume that I'm just saying
the same thing as the others.

12:00.880 --> 12:05.479
No, you're saying a list of names,
our names mainly.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.639
Moran, Pritchard, Prentis,
O'Donnell, Clara, Doctor, Bennett, Cass.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.079
Who's Prentis?
Mole-faced chap.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.719
What's the matter?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.319
Clara, what's happening?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.519
You've moved inside.
You're inside here now.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.959
- What am I doing?
- Uh...

12:25.760 --> 12:27.919
Nothing. You're just standing there.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.439
I'm not trying to kill you?
Why am I not trying to kill you?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.359
No, wait. You're moving,

12:36.120 --> 12:37.599
going toward the control panel.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.679
Oh, no!

12:47.400 --> 12:49.679
He's opened the Faraday cage.
He's let the other ghosts out.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.359
Clara, I need to talk to me now.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.199
What, didn't you hear me?
You just opened the Faraday cage.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.839
The other ghosts are outside.
Shouldn't we be hiding?

12:54.920 --> 12:57.319
In a minute.
I need to talk to the ghost me.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.239
Okay.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.359
Doctor, you're on.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.999
Doctor, such an honour.
I've always been a huge admirer.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.599
This is really a delight.
Finally, someone worth talking to.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.399
So, firstly, why are you here?

13:18.120 --> 13:19.519
Clara, Clara, what's happening?

13:20.040 --> 13:21.159
Um...

13:23.400 --> 13:24.439
Uh...

13:25.320 --> 13:26.879
You've just stopped.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.559
Oh, no, wait.
You've started again.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.399
His message changed.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.519
He's saying something different.
He's saying...

13:36.200 --> 13:37.639
- What?
- What?

13:37.760 --> 13:38.919
What?

13:40.960 --> 13:43.759
He's saying,
"The chamber will open tonight."

13:45.880 --> 13:48.559
Clara, now the ghosts are out,
go to the Faraday cage.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.479
They won't be able to get you in there.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.879
- Oh, there's a problem.
- Problem!

13:53.120 --> 13:55.639
What problem? Oh, really, 'cause
everything else is going so smoothly.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.599
The phone signal won't be able
to get through.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.719
What you'll have to do...

13:58.800 --> 14:00.519
I know, put the phone outside

14:01.040 --> 14:02.719
and you can watch it through
the little round porthole.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.839
And when you see it ringing, if it is
safe to do so, go out and answer it.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.159
Okay, well, how long are you gonna...

14:07.240 --> 14:08.519
Clara, listen to me,

14:09.120 --> 14:10.279
don't let that phone out of your sight.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.079
I need to be able to reach you.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.519
I need to know everything my ghost does.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.679
Do you understand?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.879
I'll come back for you. I swear.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.839
Come on.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.079
Oh, wait a minute.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.439
- Not you, O'Donnell.
- Well, why not?

14:31.520 --> 14:33.079
Someone need to stay here
and mind the shop.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.999
What if Clara calls?

14:36.160 --> 14:40.359
The last bloke that said something like
that to me got dangled out of a window.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.319
Maybe the Doctor's right.
Maybe it's best if you stay here.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.639
Never going to happen.
Seriously, have you two met me?

14:59.960 --> 15:01.119
Prentis.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.119
Prentis!

15:08.960 --> 15:11.079
Guess that dead body
wasn't so dead after all.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.079
And now we've got the writing.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.719
The Fisher King
did it himself.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.279
The future is still coming.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.799
He's taking the suspended-animation
chamber to the judge.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.599
What was that?

15:37.720 --> 15:39.399
We need to get back to the TARDIS.

15:39.640 --> 15:40.719
Now!

15:47.600 --> 15:48.599
Let's cut it off!

15:52.840 --> 15:54.039
Let's split up!

15:55.680 --> 15:57.479
Go on, Bennett!

17:00.120 --> 17:01.279
No, Bennett, wait!

17:14.680 --> 17:16.398
Why did you come?

17:16.480 --> 17:18.279
You shouldn't have come.
I mean, you never listen to anyone.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.439
- It drives me mad.
- To keep an eye on you.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.759
Idiot.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.799
So, don't die.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.119
Who's next on the list?

17:55.360 --> 17:57.399
That list your ghost
was saying,

17:57.560 --> 18:00.039
that's the order in which
people are going to die. Isn't it?

18:00.160 --> 18:01.719
I mean, I've only just figured that out,

18:01.960 --> 18:03.639
but you knew that all along.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.759
Didn't you?

18:05.120 --> 18:09.719
Moran, Pritchard, Prentis, O'Donnell.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.559
I thought, perhaps
because her ghost wasn't there

18:12.880 --> 18:14.999
in the future, like Prentis' was...

18:16.400 --> 18:17.879
I thought maybe...

18:18.560 --> 18:21.559
Maybe it wouldn't happen.
Maybe she stood a chance.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.959
Yeah, but you didn't try very hard
to stop her, though, did you?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.759
It's almost like you
wanted to test your theory.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.439
So, who's next?

18:32.160 --> 18:33.839
- Clara.
- Yeah.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.839
Except now you're gonna
do something about it, aren't you?

18:38.520 --> 18:40.359
Yeah, 'cause it's getting closer to you.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.479
You change history

18:41.880 --> 18:44.439
to save yourself,
but not to save O'Donnell.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.319
You wouldn't save her.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.719
This isn't about saving me.
I'm a dead man walking.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.719
I'm changing history to save Clara.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.439
O'Donnell's dead.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.519
Oh, no. No, no, no.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.679
Oh, now, don't you dare.
Don't you dare!

19:50.360 --> 19:52.319
Big day for you.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.679
Time travel, twice.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.719
Whoa, uh, really?

19:58.200 --> 19:59.479
When are we going to?

19:59.920 --> 20:01.559
Off the map,
out of the rule book.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.679
What if I don't die?

20:04.360 --> 20:05.359
What if I refuse?

20:06.120 --> 20:08.399
I'm gonna go back to the base
and I'm gonna save Clara

20:08.480 --> 20:09.839
because that's what I do.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.519
And I don't see anyone here
who's going to stop me.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.199
Why're we still here?

20:32.800 --> 20:35.399
No! No, no, no, no.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.279
- What?
- We've moved half an hour backwards.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.399
I'm locked in my own time stream.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.079
The TARDIS won't let me leave.

20:45.760 --> 20:46.879
Well, what do we do?

20:46.960 --> 20:50.519
Now we have to keep out of sight,
until time catches up.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.879
Where's Bennett?
We need to get going.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.959
Probably still throwing up.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.599
Prentis. He's alive.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.959
No, he's just not dead yet
and we don't tell him.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.839
- But he's right there. We can just...
- No.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.239
However that sentence ends,
no, we can't.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.279
Save him and you want to save O'Donnell.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.639
You can't cheat time. I just tried.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.639
You can't just go back
and cut off tragedy at the root.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.799
Because you find yourself talking to
someone you just saw dead on a slab.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.359
Because then you really do see ghosts.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.319
We don't tell him. Understand?

21:30.400 --> 21:33.079
Not a word. We don't have that right.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.399
Albar Prentis,
Funeral Director.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.519
You're from Tivoli, aren't you?

21:44.600 --> 21:46.959
The most invaded planet in the galaxy.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.359
Our capital city
has a sign saying,

21:49.640 --> 21:52.639
"If you occupied us,
you'd be home by now."

21:52.760 --> 21:55.479
Yes, I've had dealings with
your lot before, I can't say I'm a fan.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.999
Oh, we do tend
to antagonize.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.639
- What are you doing here?
- Ah, yes, of course.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.199
The Doc, the sword,
the forsaken, the temple.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.479
When we found out
what the ghost was saying,

22:18.560 --> 22:20.079
we weren't surprised,

22:20.160 --> 22:21.879
because the words,

22:21.960 --> 22:24.519
they were already inside us.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.879
But you...

22:28.200 --> 22:29.199
You were, weren't you?

22:29.400 --> 22:30.999
You didn't know what
the words were going to be.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.359
Uh, no, I didn't. How did you know?

22:35.160 --> 22:37.399
Who was the one person who didn't
see the writing in the space ship?

22:38.680 --> 22:40.679
Me. Cass wouldn't let me go inside.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.799
That's why the ghosts didn't
hurt you when they had the chance,

22:42.880 --> 22:44.439
because the message isn't inside you.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.879
Yes, I suppose that makes sense.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.479
So you can get the phone back?

22:50.640 --> 22:51.679
What?

22:55.360 --> 22:57.399
She's saying I should
go get the phone back.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.239
- No.
- Listen. Listen, I need...

23:03.480 --> 23:05.599
We... We need to be able
to contact the Doctor

23:05.680 --> 23:06.999
and you are the only one
who can do this.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.279
Okay.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.279
No. She's right.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.559
Neither of you can get it back.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.519
What? What is it?

23:33.600 --> 23:34.639
- What does she say?
- It doesn't matter.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.559
Please.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.759
She said to ask you whether
travelling with the Doctor changed you

23:41.840 --> 23:44.359
and why you always have to put
other people's lives at risk.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.639
He taught me to do what has to be done.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.999
We should get going.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.519
I need more time.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.559
It's too soon. I haven't saved her yet.

24:10.400 --> 24:14.919
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.479
I've got no choice now.
I have to face the Fisher King.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.839
You, back to the TARDIS.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.199
Look, he'll be fine.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.919
I promise.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.519
Okay. Didn't need anyone
to translate that.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.519
Now I'm ready.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.039
I've come from the future.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.799
I've seen the chaos you caused,
the bloodshed.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.319
Tell me what you have seen.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.359
- Ghosts.
- Ghosts?

25:49.960 --> 25:52.079
Souls wrenched from the dead,

25:52.480 --> 25:55.479
repeating directions to here,
to this spot, over and over.

25:55.760 --> 25:59.559
How many ghosts
do I create? How many?

25:59.640 --> 26:02.279
Four that I know of.
Maybe five, by now.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.799
Probably more since I left.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.799
My ghosts
will make more ghosts.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.039
Enough to bring an armada,

26:12.280 --> 26:17.199
enough to wake me from my sleep.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.399
What will happen
when your people arrive?

27:32.720 --> 27:37.439
We will drain the
oceans and put the humans in chains.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.599
This world is protected, by me.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.759
Yes,

27:42.840 --> 27:47.199
one man, lost in time.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.959
Door emergency security lock.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.359
The seed
of their destruction is already sown.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.519
They will die. The message will be sent.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.359
My people will come

28:25.760 --> 28:30.999
and you will do nothing to stop it,

28:32.320 --> 28:34.079
Time Lord.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.559
Hey! No, no, no, no!

28:39.640 --> 28:41.279
Cass, wait!

28:41.840 --> 28:42.879
What are you doing?

28:45.520 --> 28:47.359
Look... Lunn, he is going to be fine.
I promise.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.679
We have to stay here.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.039
I know that look. I do that look.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.159
Okay, fine.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.759
But we stick together.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.919
Time Lords,

29:14.080 --> 29:16.759
cowardly, vain curators,

29:16.840 --> 29:18.799
who suddenly remembered they had teeth,

29:18.880 --> 29:21.879
and became the most
war-like race in the galaxy.

29:22.240 --> 29:23.839
But, you...

29:24.120 --> 29:25.839
You!

29:26.120 --> 29:29.119
You are curious.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.839
You have seen the words, too.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.879
I can hear them tick inside you.

29:34.280 --> 29:37.639
But you are still locked
in your history,

29:37.760 --> 29:41.159
still slavishly protecting time.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.879
Willing to die,

29:42.960 --> 29:45.559
rather than change a word of the future.

29:47.800 --> 29:48.879
Lunn?

29:58.040 --> 30:06.079
Lunn?

30:23.240 --> 30:24.479
Oh, Cass.

30:26.280 --> 30:29.919
Cass?

30:31.320 --> 30:35.479
Ugh. Idiot. I'm an idiot.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.079
You will be a strong beacon.

31:21.320 --> 31:24.119
How many ghosts can I make of you?

31:24.320 --> 31:26.599
You really have got
a lot in common with the Tivolians.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.119
You'll both do anything to survive.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.759
They'll surrender to anyone.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.399
You will hijack other peoples' souls

31:34.600 --> 31:37.319
and turn them into
electromagnetic projections.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.319
That will to endure,

31:42.560 --> 31:43.879
that refusal

31:45.040 --> 31:47.079
to ever cease,

31:48.320 --> 31:49.479
it's extraordinary.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.959
And it makes a fellow think,
because you know what,

31:53.520 --> 31:57.599
if all I had to do to survive is tweak
the future a bit, what's stopping me?

31:57.720 --> 32:00.919
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the ripple effect.
Maybe it will mean

32:01.000 --> 32:05.159
that the universe will be ruled by cats
or something in the future.

32:05.320 --> 32:06.479
But the way I see it,

32:06.560 --> 32:10.479
even a ghastly future
is better than no future at all.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.919
You robbed those people of their deaths.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.439
Made them nothing more
than a message in a bottle.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.399
You violated something
more important than time.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.959
You bent
the rules of life and death.

32:28.960 --> 32:32.199
So I'm putting things straight.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.439
Here. Now.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.119
This is where your story ends.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.559
Oh! There you are.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.679
There is nothing you can do.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.759
I've already done it.

33:46.280 --> 33:49.119
The words have gone. I got rid of them.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.639
The future I saw,
none of that will happen now.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.639
The message will never
contaminate my friends.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.119
No one will die.
No one is coming to save you.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.599
That's the thing about knowing
you're going to die,

34:02.400 --> 34:03.999
you've got nothing left to lose.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.759
No, no, no.
You've got to get out of here.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.438
The ghost locked me in. It's a trap.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.399
Come on! Faraday cage, now!

35:03.040 --> 35:04.319
The Time Lord.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.559
Night.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.879
This is Security Protocol 712.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.319
The echelon circuit has been activated.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.439
Please stow any hand-luggage
and prepare for departure.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.719
Back. Get back.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.359
Don't kiss me. Morning breath.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.279
Doctor?

36:32.760 --> 36:33.879
Follow me.

36:43.480 --> 36:45.599
What's that noise?

36:45.960 --> 36:48.959
It's the call of the
Fisher King. The call of their master.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.999
Where they going?

37:25.160 --> 37:26.199
So what was it?

37:26.280 --> 37:28.119
- Your ghost?
- A hologram,

37:28.200 --> 37:31.079
like the one we made of you, to lure
the ghosts into the Faraday cage.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.879
With a soupcon
of artificial intelligence

37:33.960 --> 37:37.159
and a few pre-recorded
phrases from there. Eh!

37:38.640 --> 37:42.839
All beamed from the sonic glasses.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.759
As soon as you brought me
and the chamber on board

37:44.840 --> 37:47.479
it connected with the base's Wi-Fi.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.639
Bob's your uncle for the Ghost Doctor.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.839
Why do they only
come out at night?

37:55.920 --> 37:58.719
Because they're electromagnetic
projections that were out of phase

37:58.800 --> 37:59.999
with the base's day-mode.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.479
Right!

38:04.200 --> 38:06.919
That's it. I've erased
the memory of the writing.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.879
Though, you might find you've lost
a couple of other memories, too.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.719
You know, like,
people you went to school with,

38:11.840 --> 38:14.199
or previous addresses,
or how to drink liquids.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.239
Uh, that's you two done.
Where's Bennett?

38:26.960 --> 38:28.359
What will happen to them?

38:28.440 --> 38:31.839
UNIT will cut out the Faraday cage
with them inside and take it away.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.679
Then the space hearse will be destroyed

38:33.760 --> 38:35.599
so the writing doesn't
infect anyone else.

38:36.680 --> 38:37.959
What do I do now?

38:39.120 --> 38:40.719
I don't understand.

38:40.960 --> 38:41.999
I do.

38:45.160 --> 38:47.199
You keep going. You have to.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.559
Take it from me,
there is a whole world out there.

38:52.040 --> 38:55.039
A galaxy. A life.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.479
What would O'Donnell have wanted?

38:59.080 --> 39:02.039
I need to erase that message
from your mind, but it's fine.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.519
I'll do it later.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.119
Lunn, will you translate
something to Cass for me?

39:09.200 --> 39:10.439
Of course.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.919
Tell her that you're in love with her
and that you always have been.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.079
What?

39:14.160 --> 39:15.519
Tell her there's no point
in wasting time,

39:15.760 --> 39:18.159
'cause things happen
and then it's too late.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.879
Tell her I wish someone
had given me that advice.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.079
Oh, God, no.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.999
I was just passing on what he said.
Please, don't...

39:50.440 --> 39:52.199
What will UNIT do with the ghosts?

39:52.520 --> 39:55.479
Drag the cage into space,
away from the Earth's magnetic field.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.279
With nothing to sustain them,
the ghosts will eventually fade away.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.239
Here's what I don't understand.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.719
You did change the future.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.119
You stopped the Fisher King
from returning.

40:06.520 --> 40:09.799
The Fisher King had been dead
for 150 years before we even got here,

40:10.840 --> 40:13.519
but once I went back,
I became part of events.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.679
But here's the thing,

40:17.080 --> 40:19.239
the messages my ghost gave,
they weren't for you.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.319
They were for me.

40:21.600 --> 40:25.359
That list.
Everyone after you was random,

40:25.480 --> 40:26.759
but you being the next name,

40:26.840 --> 40:29.439
that's what made me confront
the Fisher King.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.159
And saying the chamber will open?

40:31.240 --> 40:34.719
That was me telling me to get inside
and when to set it for.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.679
Smart.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.959
Except that's not why I said them.

40:42.880 --> 40:43.959
How do you mean?

40:45.360 --> 40:47.319
I programmed my ghost to say them

40:47.400 --> 40:49.119
because that's what my ghost had said.

40:49.480 --> 40:52.279
And the only reason that I created
my ghost hologram in the first place,

40:52.520 --> 40:53.879
was because I saw it here.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.119
I was reverse engineering the narrative.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.239
Okay. That's still pretty smart.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.999
You do not understand.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.119
When did I first
have those ideas, Clara?

41:07.280 --> 41:09.199
Well, it must have been...

41:13.320 --> 41:15.639
- Wow!
- Exactly!

41:16.440 --> 41:18.599
Who composed Beethoven's Fifth?

41:27.160 --> 41:29.079
Doctor, help me!

41:29.160 --> 41:30.879
Yes, you're
the very next thing on the list.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.839
We are Vikings!

41:34.960 --> 41:36.799
You fight or you die.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.079
They are called the Mire.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.199
- You will beg for mercy.
- Ha, ha, ha!

41:40.280 --> 41:41.759
The deadliest
warrior race in the galaxy?

41:41.840 --> 41:42.879
One of them, yes. Why?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.559
I think this village
just declared war on them.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.879
There's gonna be a war.
I hear some news.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.399
We are gonna win the hell out of it.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.959
- Why are you here?
- I'm the Doctor,

41:50.040 --> 41:52.039
and I save people.
