.

00:05.171 --> 00:05.797
[camera shutter clicks]

00:06.965 --> 00:08.591
- I'm investigating Sean
for sex trafficking.

00:08.633 --> 00:11.678
- This is my child!
How dare you!

00:11.720 --> 00:14.222
- There are girls out there
who are being hurt right now,

00:14.264 --> 00:15.807
and we're running out of time.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.600
- According to every report
I've read,

00:17.642 --> 00:19.728
you have nothing
because there's nothing there.

00:19.769 --> 00:21.563
- He did rehab in Waunakee?

00:21.604 --> 00:24.524
- He spent his summers up there
with his dad, up at the cabin.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.026
- Maybe this is where
it all started?

00:26.067 --> 00:28.862
* *

00:28.903 --> 00:29.863
- Oh, my God.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.073
* *

00:33.825 --> 00:36.745
[helicopter whirring]

00:39.831 --> 00:42.751
[indistinct chatter]

00:42.792 --> 00:49.758

00:50.633 --> 00:51.801
- [sighs]

[foreboding music]

01:55.657 --> 01:57.033

01:57.075 --> 01:58.284
This way.

01:58.326 --> 02:05.458
* *

02:22.308 --> 02:25.729
We don't have an ID yet.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.607
M.E. thinks the body's
a decade old.

02:31.317 --> 02:34.863
Whoever buried her
used chemicals.

02:34.904 --> 02:38.324
Lye, bleach, hydroxide.

02:40.201 --> 02:44.080
Knew how to destroy evidence.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.208
Learned that somewhere.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.506
Patty, your son led us to her.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.383
Sean is involved in this.

02:59.387 --> 03:02.515
You can't protect him.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.477
And you can't save him
from this.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.735
Help me bring in Sean now.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.947
- [scoffs]

03:17.989 --> 03:21.159
He's my son.
You're not bringing him in.

03:21.201 --> 03:28.333

[engine roars]

[line ringing]

03:39.511 --> 03:41.805
[phone buzzing]

03:41.846 --> 03:42.889
- Boss.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.140
- All right,
tell me where we're at.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.476
- We got an ID.
Body's that of Jodie Brown.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.728
Listen, I'm going to
put you on speaker.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.730
All right,
so Jodie was 12 years old

03:50.772 --> 03:52.023
when she was reported
missing

03:52.065 --> 03:53.525
15 years ago out of Waunakee.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.568
- Family IDed her
off her shoes and bracelet.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.986
We're waiting on dental
to confirm.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.072
- Jodie lived about a mile
from that cabin.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.615
- She have contact with Sean?

04:00.657 --> 04:02.492
- Her parents don't remember
the O'Neals,

04:02.534 --> 04:03.576
but they said that
before she went missing,

04:03.618 --> 04:04.703
she was hanging with
a new crowd.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.995
- Yeah. New crowd, older kids.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.580
The mom thought
they were teenagers.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.457
Sean was around 17 then, Sarge.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.251
- Jodie disappeared August 15.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.212
Now Chief O'Neal was in Houston
at a police conference,

04:14.254 --> 04:17.257
but we haven't confirmed
Sean's whereabouts as of yet.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.800
- M.E. couldn't rule
sexual assault,

04:18.842 --> 04:21.261
couldn't rule time of death,
but could rule cause of death.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.971
It was a cracked hyoid.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.222
Sean strangled her.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.265
- All right, keep moving.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.474
Call ahead to ASA Chapman.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.600
Let her know I'm coming.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.644
- All right, I'm on it.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.604
- If we want to get the
charges for the murder,

04:31.646 --> 04:33.648
then we need to connect
Sean directly to that cabin

04:33.690 --> 04:35.442
and directly to Jodie.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.943
Real, physical evidence,

04:36.985 --> 04:38.778
above and beyond
the shadow of a doubt.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.406
- Okay, Sean used
lye and bleach.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.949
DNA's all gone now.

04:42.991 --> 04:46.870
- We've got no cams,
no GPS, no tolls.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.997
Cabin was in the middle
of nowhere.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.248
It was 15 years ago.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.499
So right now,
we got no witnesses,

04:51.541 --> 04:53.793
no way to tie Sean
to the location.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.420
- OK, what about
the sex trafficking?

04:55.462 --> 04:56.838
The other women?
- Girls.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.549
- Guys, I got another
connection out in Waunakee.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.051
Her name is Isla Avers.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.927
She's 20 years old now,
but when she was 17,

05:02.969 --> 05:05.972
she went to the same detox
that Sean did back in Waunakee.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.515
Same exact dates.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.309
And then three weeks later,
she was in Chicago

05:09.351 --> 05:10.518
getting therapy at Safe Place.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.145
- She followed Sean to Chicago?

05:12.187 --> 05:13.688
- And I thought she'd just be
another missing because

05:13.730 --> 05:15.065
she became real hard
to track after like

05:15.106 --> 05:16.483
two months at Safe Place.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.818
But on her 18th birthday,
Isla changed her name

05:18.860 --> 05:20.445
the moment the office opened.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.490
And she's been moving every six
months, exactly six to the T.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.699
- She's running.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.658
- Something happened to her,
Sarge.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.160
- You got an LKA?
- Fuller Park.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.871
- Go with her.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.664
[knocking]

05:35.502 --> 05:36.461
- Yeah?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.880
- Isla Avers?

05:38.922 --> 05:39.964
- No, sorry.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.050
[door thuds]

05:42.092 --> 05:44.177
- It's OK.
- Why do you know my real name?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.595
- We're police.
- No.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.639
No, I don't need police.
I didn't call anybody.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.350
I don't want any help.
- We know about Sean O'Neal.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.726
- That's why we're here.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.105
We just want to talk to you
about him.

05:55.146 --> 05:59.192
- I don't--no, I don't know
anybody by that name.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.528
I've got nothing to tell you.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.072
I don't. OK?

06:04.114 --> 06:06.908
I don't have
to talk to you, do I?

06:08.993 --> 06:11.621
- We need you
to come in with us.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.377
- Please.
Please, I don't want to talk.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.170
I don't have anything to say.

06:19.212 --> 06:23.508
- I'm sorry, Isla, but we need
you to come in with us now.

06:26.678 --> 06:29.305
I know you met Sean at detox,

06:29.347 --> 06:31.933
and then you went
to Safe Place.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.935
He invited you?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.064
You change your name,

06:38.106 --> 06:41.109
you keep moving,
keep changing your hair color.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.070
It's like you're desperately
trying not to be found.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.072
Why? What happened?

06:46.114 --> 06:49.534
- Nothing happened to me.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.620
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.414
I don't care
if you believe me,

06:54.456 --> 06:56.041
and I don't care
what happened to me.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.001
I just want to go home.
- Why?

06:58.043 --> 06:59.502
So you can pack up
and run again?

06:59.544 --> 07:00.462
- It's got nothing
to do with you.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.588
- It does.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.840
It has a lot to do
with me and you.

07:03.882 --> 07:07.135
And all the other girls that
have gone through Safe Place.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.596
You know, Sean's still
out there right now.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.597
He's still running Safe Place--

07:10.638 --> 07:12.515
- Don't do that.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.726
Don't put that on me.

07:19.731 --> 07:23.651
- You're right.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.446
You're right. I'm sorry.

07:26.488 --> 07:33.620
* *

07:35.455 --> 07:37.582
[sighs]

07:40.085 --> 07:41.294
You know,
you're the third girl

07:41.336 --> 07:44.005
I've sat across from like this.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.221
I sat across from Sean, too.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.184
And I saw it,

07:56.226 --> 07:59.688
how he looks like
he can see right through you,

07:59.729 --> 08:03.483
like he understands.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.236
And I trusted him.

08:06.277 --> 08:10.365
I'm police.
It's my job to read people.

08:10.407 --> 08:14.035
And I trusted him.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.372
But you didn't.

08:17.414 --> 08:21.292
You got away. You're here.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.504
You're unbroken,

08:24.546 --> 08:27.048
and I'm so glad.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.305
- I can't tell you anything.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.394
- You can.
I know you can.

08:39.436 --> 08:43.565
- I can't.

08:43.606 --> 08:48.028
- Isla...

08:48.069 --> 08:51.239
he doesn't have to know
you talked to me.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.412
Do it for you.

08:57.454 --> 09:04.586
* *

09:05.670 --> 09:10.216
- He used to have
sessions with me.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.511
Like, therapy.

09:13.553 --> 09:18.600
I told him everything
about me.

09:18.641 --> 09:23.313
Everything.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.732
He would listen.
He cared.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.108
But then one day,
it was like

09:27.150 --> 09:31.112
he just made a decision
about me.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.869
He took me to the woods.
He...

09:40.747 --> 09:44.668
He raped me.

09:44.709 --> 09:48.213
And then, um, I--

09:48.254 --> 09:52.634
I was just nothing anymore.
[sniffles]

09:52.676 --> 09:56.388
He put something
over my mouth, and...

09:56.429 --> 10:00.100
when I woke up, Sean was gone.

10:00.141 --> 10:04.521
I was in a room with
a lock on the door.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.941
It was a prison.

10:07.982 --> 10:11.194
There were girls there.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.987
They told me
what was going to happen,

10:13.029 --> 10:16.324
that I was going to be sold.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.414
I don't know how long
I was in that room, but...

10:22.455 --> 10:25.291
men took me out.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.003
They washed me.

10:28.044 --> 10:32.132
They put me in a van, and...

10:32.173 --> 10:37.595
as soon as the doors opened,
I ran.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.432
I just ran.
I ran, and...

10:42.934 --> 10:45.478
And I didn't stop running.

10:45.520 --> 10:52.444
* *

10:54.863 --> 10:56.656
- I think we got him.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.658
This is a firsthand account
of rape,

10:58.700 --> 11:01.578
of being held,
of being trafficked.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.830
We got him.
- It's still not enough.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.373
It's he said, she said.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.500
There's no documented
evidence of trauma.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.419
She never reported it.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.338
She's got priors.
She uses.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.506
She's a bad victim.
She's unreliable.

11:13.548 --> 11:17.052
- That girl--
that girl is not unreliable.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.553
- Look, you asked me here
to tell you when you have it.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.472
You don't have it.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.474
Not to mention, you just
practically promised her

11:22.515 --> 11:23.808
you'd never make her testify,

11:23.850 --> 11:25.393
and I could argue coercion
in my sleep.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.644
- Coercion?

11:26.686 --> 11:27.979
- You implied she had
no choice but to talk.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.023
- We're going ahead
with the arrest anyway.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.483
I don't care.
It's the best we got.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.111
I want Sean O'Neal
off the streets now.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.031
We're going to bring him in,
we use the 48 in the box,

11:38.073 --> 11:40.283
and just hope to hell
we get enough to charge.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.535
Let's go.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.246
[suspenseful music]

11:45.288 --> 11:52.212
* *

11:53.672 --> 11:54.923
Chicago PD.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.330
- Hands up.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.582
On your knees.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.002
Get on your knees.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.427
[handcuffs clicking]

12:46.891 --> 12:47.100
.

12:47.142 --> 12:47.851
- Jodie, she was your first?

12:51.312 --> 12:54.607
You raped her,
and then you strangled her?

12:54.649 --> 12:56.526
[tense music]

12:56.568 --> 13:00.530
How long you been attracted
to children, Sean?

13:00.572 --> 13:06.119
Is that why you started using
all those years ago?

13:06.161 --> 13:09.330
Oh, now you don't want
to talk to me?

13:09.372 --> 13:11.041
Sit down.

13:11.082 --> 13:15.420
* *

13:15.462 --> 13:17.630
How do you pick them?

13:17.672 --> 13:21.051
Which ones to bring in
the woods with you,

13:21.092 --> 13:25.221
to rape and then sell?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.683
Hmm?

13:28.725 --> 13:31.603
Is that why you sell them?

13:31.644 --> 13:35.315
So they can't report you?

13:35.357 --> 13:38.526
So you don't have to kill them
like you did Jodie?

13:41.946 --> 13:45.408
We have you.
Do you understand?

13:45.450 --> 13:47.160
We own you now.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.371
Unless you talk,
unless you tell us

13:49.412 --> 13:52.290
what happened
to all these girls,

13:52.332 --> 13:54.000
you're going to spend
the rest of your life in prison

13:54.042 --> 13:57.087
being beaten and raped.

13:57.128 --> 14:02.592
- You should talk to my kids
at Safe Place.

14:02.634 --> 14:07.764
I helped them when CPD won't.

14:07.806 --> 14:11.434
I save them.
- Not all of them.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.478
What about the ones
you don't save?

14:13.520 --> 14:16.189
Where are they?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.860
- What do you think
this is going to do for you,

14:20.902 --> 14:24.614
Hailey, finding these kids?

14:27.242 --> 14:31.621
Do you think this is
going to save you?

14:31.663 --> 14:35.041
Do you think this might
stop the pain?

14:35.083 --> 14:39.879
- Is that why you try
to save some of them?

14:39.921 --> 14:42.674
[knocking on door]

14:42.716 --> 14:43.883
- All right, we are done.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.218
He's done talking.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.720
He has no more answers
to give you.

14:46.761 --> 14:47.971
You can leave.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.889
I'll have a moment alone
with my client.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.349
- Don't do this.
Talk to me.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.350
I know you want to talk to me.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.601
- Unless you want
to lose your job,

14:53.643 --> 14:58.106
I suggest you leave
this room very swiftly.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.697
- OK.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.036
- We knew we were
going to need more.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.538
We got 40 hours left.
Now what do we got?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.248
- We ain't got nothing
from the search warrants.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.458
- Sean burned the documents.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.168
- Chief told him
to destroy evidence.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.128
- All right, Sean's phone?
The burner we IDed?

15:20.170 --> 15:22.255
- Not there. No tech.
And GPS has been wiped.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.090
- OK.
What about Isla?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.467
Anything there?

15:25.508 --> 15:26.968
- All she remembers about
the place she was held,

15:27.010 --> 15:28.887
it has locked doors,
barred windows.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.388
- She remembers the men,
the girls,

15:30.430 --> 15:32.015
but no concrete descriptions.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.767
Girl was small,
big eyes, scared.

15:33.808 --> 15:34.809
Nothing more than that.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.187
- Nothing actionable yet.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.565
- You know, we do know now
that Sean is a pedophile.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.860
He's been attracted
to young girls for years.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.445
But when he started
trafficking,

15:45.487 --> 15:47.947
he already had Helms and
Kenning at the ready, right?

15:47.989 --> 15:49.324
- He knew them.
- Yeah.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.951
If he knew them, he might
have been a customer.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.162
- There might be evidence.
- Mm-hmm.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.249
- Sean was incredibly careful.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.669
Even years ago, he was barely
using his personal phone.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.588
- Yeah, last time
he really used it was in 2013.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.882
- Nothing on his email,
unless it's all coded.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.967
- OK, OK.
I got another number.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.803
[soft suspenseful music]

16:09.844 --> 16:12.639
OK, 2013, Sean O'Neal
called this number twice

16:12.681 --> 16:14.349
from his personal.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.643
And it also pops on
Victor Helms' cell phone.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.062
- Who the hell is it?
- I'll tell you in two seconds.

16:19.104 --> 16:24.317
The number is registered to
Joseph Collins, 28 years old.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.986
He's got two priors, one for
transportation of minors,

16:27.028 --> 16:28.488
the other one for solicitation.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.240
And he's got a sprinter van
registered in his name.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.075
- This is the guy
transporting the girls.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.036
- Yeah, but it's not enough
for a warrant.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.247
- We're going to find a way
to bring him in.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.249
- All right, slow and steady.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.459
Just get Joseph outside.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.838
If he runs, we'll take him.

16:44.879 --> 16:51.803
* *

16:53.763 --> 16:54.931
[knocking on door]

16:54.973 --> 16:57.434
Joseph Collins, Chicago PD!

16:59.102 --> 17:01.771
Come on.
Joseph Collins, Chicago PD.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.690
Look, Joseph, I can see you.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.693
Come on out.
We only want to talk.

17:06.735 --> 17:09.154
- Sergeant, looks like
he's disposing of evidence.

17:13.908 --> 17:17.078
- What are you doing?
Joe, no, stop. Stop.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.371
- Sarge, we got
a female inside.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.372
Do you see her?
Is she underage?

17:19.414 --> 17:20.373
- I don't know.
Couldn't see.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.708
- I think she's underage,
Sarge.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.043
I think she's a minor.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.419
- Ow, stop.
- Come on.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.424
- Chicago PD!

17:29.466 --> 17:30.759
- [gasps]
- On the ground!

17:30.800 --> 17:32.594
[both grunt]

17:32.635 --> 17:34.012
Hands.
Let me see your hands.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.180
Behind your back.
- It's OK.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.681
It's OK.
Are you OK?

17:36.723 --> 17:37.807
What are you doing here?

17:37.849 --> 17:39.059
- I'm his girlfriend.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.393
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:40.435 --> 17:42.312
You've got no right
kicking in our door.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.522
You've got no right.

17:55.283 --> 17:55.450
.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.368
- I'm telling you,
I don't know.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.578
- And I don't believe you.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.580
Now, what do you know
about Sean O'Neal?

18:00.622 --> 18:02.123
- Nothing.
I don't know no Sean O'Neal.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.875
- All right,
tell me what you do know.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.168
- You talking crazy.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.921
- You see where you are
right now?

18:07.962 --> 18:10.924
You are on the ground in cuffs.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.134
Your van right there,

18:13.176 --> 18:15.595
it's about to be towed
to the district.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.430
I guarantee you,
I'm going to find evidence

18:17.472 --> 18:22.435
of girls that are missing,
raped, and dead.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.146
So in about eight hours,
you're going to be charged

18:25.188 --> 18:27.190
with sex trafficking,
conspiracy...

18:27.232 --> 18:28.566
- Wait, what?

18:28.608 --> 18:31.111
- Transportation of minors,
sexual assault,

18:31.152 --> 18:32.570
and felony murder.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.780
- What?

18:33.822 --> 18:35.281
- Yeah, your little
girlfriend over there,

18:35.323 --> 18:38.201
she's going to have the same
charges dropped on her name.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.536
- No, no.
She didn't do anything.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.287
- Then protect her.
Protect yourself.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.372
- I don't know
what you want from me.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.874
- Yes, you do.

18:44.916 --> 18:48.878
Now what is the van for, Joe?

18:48.920 --> 18:52.132
What is the van for?

18:52.173 --> 18:53.425
- I give rides, that's it.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.594
- To who?
- Girls.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.430
Girls, OK?
I give them rides.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.764
I get a text.
I pick them up.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.641
I give them rides.
That's all, man.

19:01.683 --> 19:05.645
- Where? Where do you pick
the girls up from?

19:09.899 --> 19:16.698
* *

19:22.037 --> 19:23.288
- We're set in the back.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.331
- Breaching.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.336
[grunts]
- Chicago PD!

19:34.591 --> 19:36.509
- Clear.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.237
Let's go.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.912
Clear.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.998
- Clear.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.214
- Clear.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.007
[sighs]

20:18.885 --> 20:21.888
They were just here.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.557
He moved them.
He just moved them.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.694
- Your 48 hours are up.
- It's not.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.903
He's got--
- Yeah, 20 minutes.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.738
Yeah, I heard.
- We have enough to charge.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.116
- No. No, you don't.
- You don't have enough.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.827
- No, Joseph Collins'
statements aren't admissible.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.870
You don't have enough.
You're releasing my kid.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.915
- Sarge, you know Chapman's
in your office?

20:52.168 --> 20:54.129
- Look, anything that you
recover from Joseph Collins,

20:54.170 --> 20:56.339
anything that you recover
from questioning him,

20:56.381 --> 20:57.632
you cannot use!

20:57.674 --> 20:59.092
- Fruit of the poisonous tree.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.468
- Are you kidding me?

21:00.510 --> 21:02.178
- It's illegal entry.
It's an illegal arrest.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.389
- No.
I moved on good faith.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.099
A suspect wanted
for sex trafficking,

21:06.141 --> 21:09.269
a sexual offender was
refusing to open the door

21:09.310 --> 21:10.603
and was manhandling
a girl in there.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.689
- She was not a girl.
She was an adult.

21:12.731 --> 21:13.773
And she was his girlfriend.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.108
- There was no way
to know that.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.402
She was shouting.
Any cop would have moved in.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.362
- [scoffs] Look,
you have been hearing shouts

21:19.404 --> 21:20.447
and seeing shadows ever since--

21:20.488 --> 21:23.867
- What are you doing?

21:23.908 --> 21:25.618
[tense music]

21:25.660 --> 21:29.664
Patty, what the hell
are you doing?

21:29.706 --> 21:33.710
You think we're finding
this evidence by magic?

21:33.752 --> 21:37.297
Your son led us there,
to a 12-year-old girl,

21:37.339 --> 21:41.926
strangled, left to rot.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.887
To a rape.

21:43.928 --> 21:49.225
Patty, to a house where girls
were being held and abused.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.686
They're out there right now.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.646
For all we know,
your son had them killed.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.440
- No, my son is not that!

21:55.482 --> 21:58.443
He is not this!

22:01.196 --> 22:02.822
He's not.
No, you're wrong.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.825
- Patty, either way,
it's not your call.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.869
Come on.
Why you being so quiet?

22:07.911 --> 22:09.329
- I can't use it.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.830
- What?

22:10.872 --> 22:12.665
- It's an illegal entry,
an illegal arrest.

22:12.707 --> 22:14.876
A coerced statement.
No ASA would touch this.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.211
- All right,
get me Sergeant Platt.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.339
I want him released right now.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.007
- Patty.

22:21.049 --> 22:23.009
Patty!

22:30.266 --> 22:30.642
.

22:30.684 --> 22:31.101
- OK, thanks.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.436
Chief and Sean just
got to Safe Place.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.522
Looks like the chief
is dropping him off.

22:35.563 --> 22:39.025
UCs will stay outside,
keep eyes.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.986
- Sean would be a fool
to do something now.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.781
- Well, let's hope
he's a fool then.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.451
[doorbell rings]

23:43.798 --> 23:45.592
- You dropped Sean off?

23:45.633 --> 23:47.052
- [scoffs] Yeah.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.429
I think you know the answer
to that since I clocked

23:49.471 --> 23:53.975
your undercovers following us.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.894
You know, there's no need
for you to be here.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.689
It's done.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.275
- I need you to look it
in the eye.

24:02.317 --> 24:03.777
- I read your report.

24:03.818 --> 24:07.614
- Patty,
if you really read them...

24:07.655 --> 24:10.158
I mean, saw the pictures...

24:12.827 --> 24:16.956
I mean, read what a little girl
said about your son,

24:16.998 --> 24:18.667
about a rape?

24:21.169 --> 24:24.673
I don't think you'd be sitting
here drinking your scotch.

24:31.471 --> 24:34.683
- You shouldn't be here.

24:34.724 --> 24:38.478
- Door was open.

24:38.520 --> 24:42.440
- Do you want to arrest me
for this?

24:42.482 --> 24:46.319
See how long I stay in
this time?

24:46.361 --> 24:48.530
- No. Go ahead.

24:50.615 --> 24:53.660
- [chuckles]

24:53.702 --> 24:56.913
You wearing a wire?

24:56.955 --> 24:58.498
- No.

24:58.540 --> 25:02.627
You want to search me?

25:02.669 --> 25:06.464
- No, I trust you.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.133
But I don't--

25:08.174 --> 25:09.759
I don't have anything
for you, Hailey.

25:09.801 --> 25:12.178
- Yeah, you do.

25:12.220 --> 25:15.265
And I think there's still
a decent part of you in there.

25:15.306 --> 25:17.434
[soft tense music]

25:17.475 --> 25:18.685
- Why?

25:18.727 --> 25:21.688
- Because of this place.

25:21.730 --> 25:25.608
Because you did save
some of the kids here.

25:25.650 --> 25:29.029
I think you wanted
to save all of them.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.614
- Do you know how many
programs I've done?

25:31.656 --> 25:34.659
- 22.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.956
- Joined six religions, too.
Did you find that out?

25:39.998 --> 25:41.374
- No.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.876
- Six.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.587
I read all these books.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.423
[book slams]
[chuckles]

25:48.465 --> 25:52.218
I did every kind of therapy.

25:52.260 --> 25:56.556
Poisoned myself.

25:56.598 --> 26:01.394
Talked to my dad, once.

26:01.436 --> 26:05.398
Don't worry, he didn't, uh...

26:05.440 --> 26:09.986
he didn't understand
what I was trying to tell him.

26:11.613 --> 26:14.574
His brain wouldn't let him.

26:14.616 --> 26:19.329
He loved me too much.

26:19.371 --> 26:23.166
But I did try.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.877
I--

26:25.919 --> 26:27.962
I didn't want to be like this.

26:28.004 --> 26:31.466
- Then tell me where
the other girls are, Sean.

26:31.508 --> 26:34.511
Did you move them?

26:34.552 --> 26:36.429
- But it didn't work.

26:36.471 --> 26:39.224
- Sean.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.434
- I couldn't fix myself.

26:41.476 --> 26:43.353
- Where are the girls?

26:43.395 --> 26:46.648
- The urges,

26:46.690 --> 26:50.944
they don't go away,

26:50.985 --> 26:54.906
because they can't.

26:54.948 --> 27:00.829
You see,
bad things do happen, Hailey.

27:03.415 --> 27:05.291
Bad things happen,

27:05.333 --> 27:10.839
but you can control
how they happen.

27:10.880 --> 27:15.260
You can control
who they happen to.

27:15.301 --> 27:19.264
And that--
that is what I learned.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.892
You can sacrifice the ones
that are already broken

27:22.934 --> 27:27.313
to save the rest.

27:27.355 --> 27:31.151
- Who deems them broken?

27:31.192 --> 27:35.655
- I do.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.949
I do.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.662
- I brought Sean
into this world.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.831
I raised him, just him and me.

27:44.873 --> 27:47.208
You understand?

27:49.252 --> 27:50.670
Yeah.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.631
You understand.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.717
I know you do.

27:59.346 --> 28:03.350
And I loved him...

28:03.391 --> 28:05.852
through all of it.

28:05.894 --> 28:09.356
All the time that he was using,
I just loved him.

28:12.567 --> 28:15.987
I tried my best for him.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.614
- You're not responsible
for this.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.699
- Yes, I am.

28:19.741 --> 28:22.619
We are responsible

28:22.660 --> 28:25.955
for the people we love.

28:25.997 --> 28:28.833
Of course we are.

28:28.875 --> 28:33.296

28:33.338 --> 28:35.924

28:45.266 --> 28:47.394
- What?

28:47.435 --> 28:49.437
What is it?

28:52.941 --> 28:56.236
- Look, it's all there.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.780
I'm sorry.

29:01.116 --> 29:04.953
You need to look it in the eye.

29:13.837 --> 29:17.257
- I was born broken.

29:19.634 --> 29:23.179
I was made like this.

29:25.473 --> 29:28.143
Something's gone.

29:30.895 --> 29:36.526
Right? And you were broken when
you were young, weren't you?

29:36.568 --> 29:41.114
And it's not 'cause
your husband left.

29:41.156 --> 29:45.452
No, you've always been broken,

29:45.493 --> 29:49.330
just like me.

29:49.372 --> 29:50.999
And when you're
already doomed--

29:51.041 --> 29:54.544
- Sean, are all the girls dead?

29:59.424 --> 30:02.385
Just tell me.

30:02.427 --> 30:04.804
Sean.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.974
[phone buzzing]

30:41.216 --> 30:44.928
- UCs clocked you
going inside.

30:44.969 --> 30:46.846
Look, anything
he would have given you,

30:46.888 --> 30:48.181
we couldn't have used.

30:48.223 --> 30:50.058
- I would have found
a way to use it.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.228
[sirens wailing]

30:54.938 --> 30:59.317
- So you want to
do that now?

30:59.359 --> 31:03.238
Make cases any way you can?

31:09.577 --> 31:11.621
He's in your head.

31:15.458 --> 31:18.753
- I know.

31:18.795 --> 31:20.880
- So let's go back to work.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.049
You, me, and the team.

31:23.091 --> 31:25.343
That's how
we're going to get him.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.179
That's how
we're going to save them.

31:31.933 --> 31:35.520
- I think they're all dead.

31:38.189 --> 31:41.151
- Come on. Hey.

31:41.192 --> 31:45.071
Let's go work.

31:45.113 --> 31:48.450
Let's go work.
Come on.

31:51.119 --> 31:52.704
- Copy that.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.748
OK, forensics sped through
the DNA on the bedding.

31:54.789 --> 31:57.125
Never hit for Sean, and
we're still waiting on more.

31:57.167 --> 31:58.877
- There's no way
he'd go there for sex.

31:58.918 --> 31:59.961
- So where we at
on the vehicles?

32:00.003 --> 32:01.254
- Still sorting.

32:01.296 --> 32:02.797
There's no cameras
in the row house street,

32:02.839 --> 32:04.924
so we got hundreds coming
and going down the block.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.259
- About half of them are clear.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.970
- What about rentals?
House rental, car, van?

32:09.012 --> 32:11.181
If he was closing up shop,
moving the girls,

32:11.222 --> 32:13.058
he would have wanted
to move them real fast.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.559
- Tower pings are clear.

32:14.601 --> 32:16.519
There's no suspicious hits
in the area on Sean's phone.

32:16.561 --> 32:18.605
- Did Vice check in yet?
- Yeah.

32:18.646 --> 32:20.815
They haven't seen an influx
of kids yet online.

32:20.857 --> 32:22.609
They doubt that the girls
could have been sold so quickly

32:22.650 --> 32:24.194
without hearing
some sort of chatter.

32:24.235 --> 32:27.405
Would have taken time.

32:27.447 --> 32:29.824
- Voight.

32:29.866 --> 32:32.619
This box truck was clocked
by three different cameras

32:32.660 --> 32:33.953
near the row houses
two days ago.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.288
Came and went.

32:35.330 --> 32:37.791
- What's that intersection?
- 39th and State.

32:37.832 --> 32:41.127
The plate is registered
to a Chevy Malibu.

32:41.169 --> 32:43.213
It's in Lakeview.
- It's hot.

32:43.254 --> 32:45.340
- This truck would be big
enough to transport the girls.

32:45.382 --> 32:47.759
You could transport
all of them.

on this block.
