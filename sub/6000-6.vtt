<i>Previously on "Finding Carter..."</i>

00:01.494 --> 00:03.156
<i>We've hooked
up five times this week.</i>

00:03.157 --> 00:05.219
<i>Each time, you take off
the second it's over.</i>

00:05.220 --> 00:08.147
<i>I thought that this was just</i>
<i>a friends-with-benefits thing.</i>

00:08.148 --> 00:09.634
Doesn't have to be.

00:09.635 --> 00:10.654
<i>Order's up.</i>

00:10.655 --> 00:12.241
Half a dozen little
study buddies.

00:12.242 --> 00:14.150
You are the man.

00:14.151 --> 00:15.425
Do you have any lip gloss?

00:15.426 --> 00:17.154
Yeah, it's in the top drawer.

00:17.989 --> 00:20.006
Is this why mom and dad
are separated?

00:20.341 --> 00:21.188
Is it true?

00:21.189 --> 00:23.082
Did you have
an affair with Lori?

00:23.083 --> 00:23.802
It's true.

00:23.803 --> 00:25.074
I knew it.

00:25.075 --> 00:27.042
Hey, how was your study session?

00:27.043 --> 00:28.322
<i>I wasn't studying.</i>

00:28.323 --> 00:29.298
<i>I was with Crash.</i>

00:29.299 --> 00:30.962
<i>Why would you let
him back in your life?</i>

00:30.963 --> 00:31.793
This is my uncle Shay.

00:31.794 --> 00:33.362
Thank you for everything
you did for Crash.

00:33.363 --> 00:35.394
Hey, Crash is family.

00:35.395 --> 00:37.087
Never turn your back on family.

00:37.088 --> 00:38.745
<i>Max, I need a favor.</i>

00:38.746 --> 00:39.272
<i>Shay just called.</i>

00:39.273 --> 00:40.826
<i>He's got a job he
wants me to do tonight.</i>

00:40.827 --> 00:42.678
<i>- Is there any chance you can do it?
- Yeah.</i>

00:42.679 --> 00:44.467
Make sure to lock this
place up extra tight.

00:45.851 --> 00:46.722
<i>You set me up.</i>

00:46.723 --> 00:49.031
<i>- The car you had dropped off last night?
- What about it?</i>

00:49.032 --> 00:49.778
<i>Are you really gonna stand there</i>

00:49.779 --> 00:51.919
and pretend you didn't know
that it was filled with coke?

00:54.928 --> 00:56.463
How many times
do I have to tell you?

00:56.464 --> 00:57.288
It wasn't me.

00:57.789 --> 00:59.488
I find that
very hard to believe.

00:59.489 --> 01:02.201
Whatever you saw, I swear,
I had nothing to do with it.

01:02.202 --> 01:05.048
What part? The guy with the
prison tattoos or the 15 pounds of coke?

01:05.049 --> 01:06.115
Whoa.

01:07.655 --> 01:09.991
What's going on?
We planning Bird's next party?

01:10.358 --> 01:11.519
Talking about Shay.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.262
I'm pretty sure your
uncle's not invited, Crash.

01:13.263 --> 01:14.983
Max thinks he's running drugs.

01:15.399 --> 01:16.248
What?

01:16.249 --> 01:17.488
Max, come on.

01:17.489 --> 01:19.083
I was supposed to make sure

01:19.084 --> 01:21.405
that a car got into
the garage last night.

01:21.406 --> 01:21.928
Okay.

01:21.929 --> 01:24.280
Crash was supposed to
do the job,

01:24.281 --> 01:27.576
then he conveniently,
at the last minute, passed it onto me.

01:27.577 --> 01:28.801
Because I was with Carter.

01:28.802 --> 01:31.468
So I get the car in, I pop
the trunk and there it is.

01:31.469 --> 01:33.013
It's like a winter wonderland.

01:33.648 --> 01:34.861
I didn't know.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.744
- Your uncle didn't tell you anything?
- I swear.

01:37.745 --> 01:39.233
That's not good enough.

01:39.546 --> 01:42.200
You've come very close to
destroying a bunch of lives

01:42.201 --> 01:44.028
in the past, including
both of ours.

01:44.029 --> 01:45.729
I'm telling you, I didn't know.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.396
How is that possible, dude?

01:47.797 --> 01:49.716
- You've been working there for months.
- What are you saying?

01:49.717 --> 01:51.489
Once a drug dealer,
always a drug dealer?

01:51.490 --> 01:53.532
It's got to get easier to
convince yourself

01:53.533 --> 01:55.741
that it's not
a big deal every time, right?

01:55.742 --> 01:58.684
I'm not that guy anymore.
I thought you knew that.

02:01.468 --> 02:03.091
Tell him, Carter.

02:04.812 --> 02:06.853
I really want to, Crash.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.123
Really?

02:11.124 --> 02:13.637
That money you gave me for Lori?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.616
Is this where it came from?

02:15.617 --> 02:17.332
I can't believe this.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.824
I tried to do it
all right this time.

02:19.825 --> 02:21.776
All I wanted was a clean slate.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.552
Crash.

02:25.392 --> 02:27.736
- Crash, don't leave.
- No.

02:28.336 --> 02:30.138
If I can't even convince you,

02:30.512 --> 02:33.220
maybe I should stop
trying to convince myself.

<i>This is Crash, leave a message.</i>

03:09.141 --> 03:10.184
Hey.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.240
It's me again.

03:13.585 --> 03:15.816
Please don't ignore me.

03:16.384 --> 03:18.888
Call me back or I'm gonna
have to start stalking you.

03:33.564 --> 03:35.555
Somebody missed her curfew.

03:38.100 --> 03:38.843
Wow.

03:39.475 --> 03:42.003
You know, it looks like she had
way more fun tonight than I did.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.267
It was just a drink after work.

03:44.627 --> 03:46.175
Is that what the kids are
calling it these days?

03:46.176 --> 03:47.955
Carter, it was nothing.

03:47.956 --> 03:49.899
Mom, it's after midnight.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.459
So...

03:52.160 --> 03:55.330
How long does nothing
take with Kyle, anyway?

03:56.547 --> 03:59.439
It was just a date. One date.

04:01.847 --> 04:04.031
I have a European
History test tomorrow.

04:04.032 --> 04:05.615
I wanted you to
hear it from me first.

04:05.616 --> 04:07.457
You know, you're the only one
here who didn't already

04:07.458 --> 04:08.781
think you were dating Kyle.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.073
It's kind of the obvious
extension of nesting.

04:11.074 --> 04:12.907
We are not dating.

04:12.908 --> 04:14.237
It was a date.

04:14.238 --> 04:16.709
That's not denial.
That's a denial.

04:16.709 --> 04:19.529
50% of kids have
parents who get divorced.

04:19.531 --> 04:21.334
Now, I always wondered how
the other half lived.

04:21.334 --> 04:22.277
We're not getting divorced.

04:22.278 --> 04:24.618
We're not even thinking
about getting a divorce.

04:24.619 --> 04:27.725
So you're just married
and dating other people?

04:27.726 --> 04:28.598
Don't forget nesting.

04:28.599 --> 04:31.237
Marriage is complicated.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.845
Your dad and I are just
working out some kinks.

04:34.477 --> 04:35.382
Okay.

04:35.383 --> 04:37.221
I can't deal with
this right now.

04:38.186 --> 04:42.142
So, whose kinks
should we expect tonight?

04:42.643 --> 04:44.753
Yours and Kyle's or dad's?

04:44.754 --> 04:46.854
This family needs
a reality show.

05:08.077 --> 05:10.102
You know on the seventh day,
God rested, right?

05:10.766 --> 05:12.766
God wasn't in high school.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.006
You okay?

05:16.007 --> 05:17.926
Yeah, just...

05:18.790 --> 05:20.669
- How do you do it?
- What?

05:20.670 --> 05:21.614
Never break a sweat?

05:21.615 --> 05:24.383
One great gift of
dysfunctional families?

05:24.384 --> 05:26.717
The ability to ignore all
of your problems.

05:26.718 --> 05:28.643
Yeah, well, see,
my parents separated

05:28.644 --> 05:31.134
and all I get is this
lousy anxiety.

05:32.230 --> 05:34.053
Is the stuff with mom
really bothering you?

05:34.054 --> 05:35.093
What, her dating

05:35.094 --> 05:37.798
or her and dad lying to us
about dad's affair with Lori?

05:37.799 --> 05:39.485
Either? Both?

05:39.886 --> 05:42.133
No more than anything else.

05:47.878 --> 05:49.002
Then again...

05:49.003 --> 05:50.598
I did have a panic attack
last night

05:50.599 --> 05:53.469
trying to figure out
what to wear to bed, so...

05:53.470 --> 05:55.705
Have you talked to your
therapist about it?

05:55.706 --> 05:56.913
Yeah.

05:56.914 --> 05:59.297
We tried meditation tapes
last week.

05:59.298 --> 06:00.057
And?

06:00.058 --> 06:02.105
I fell asleep.

06:02.968 --> 06:05.681
Yesterday, she asked me
if I wanted to try pills.

06:06.601 --> 06:07.585
Pills?

06:07.586 --> 06:09.624
What do you think?

06:10.730 --> 06:14.357
Isn't Carter kind of
the go-to drug advisor?

06:14.358 --> 06:16.636
Yeah, but you're the...

06:16.637 --> 06:19.081
Has-it-all-figured-out advisor.

06:22.101 --> 06:24.825
I've known a lot of kids that

06:24.826 --> 06:26.950
become dependent on their meds,

06:26.951 --> 06:31.205
and they start to
use them irresponsibly.

06:33.229 --> 06:34.549
Plus...

06:35.485 --> 06:37.804
I think that you have
a lot of other options.

06:37.805 --> 06:38.845
Like what?

06:38.846 --> 06:42.044
You might be too cynical for it.

06:42.045 --> 06:43.509
Try me.

06:50.721 --> 06:52.925
You know, this pushes my limits.

06:55.126 --> 06:58.029
But... it's
surprisingly effective.

06:58.930 --> 07:01.097
My office is open anytime.

07:01.698 --> 07:02.984
Thanks.

07:20.285 --> 07:21.903
<i>What else do
you have in the cars?</i>

07:22.207 --> 07:23.453
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

07:23.454 --> 07:26.300
<i>I mean Max found
the coke in the car.</i>

07:26.301 --> 07:28.269
<i>What was Max doing in my car?</i>

07:28.270 --> 07:30.204
When I give you a job,
you do it.

07:33.748 --> 07:35.548
Is Goldilocks gonna snitch?

07:35.549 --> 07:37.349
No, Max knows better than that.

07:37.731 --> 07:39.879
For his sake, I hope so.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.831
What if we had been caught.

07:41.832 --> 07:43.479
I've been doing this 15 years.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.126
Let me worry about what-if.

07:45.127 --> 07:46.139
Yeah, well, I'm on probation.

07:46.140 --> 07:47.996
I could end up back in jail
for half my life

07:47.997 --> 07:49.339
because of your
little side business.

07:49.340 --> 07:52.426
Well, the money from my little
side business got you out of prison.

07:53.178 --> 07:55.474
So what, you think I owe you?

07:55.475 --> 07:56.514
I saved you.

07:56.515 --> 07:58.794
I knew you couldn't
handle knowing how.

07:59.819 --> 08:01.162
You should have told me.

08:01.163 --> 08:03.347
It should have been my decision.

08:03.348 --> 08:05.060
People like us don't
get to decide.

08:05.061 --> 08:08.283
You know, you can dress yourself up
like those kids you used to deal to.

08:08.284 --> 08:10.296
You're never
gonna be one of them.

08:12.527 --> 08:14.291
Who the hell are you?

08:14.292 --> 08:16.055
I was just leaving.

08:16.056 --> 08:18.271
Not so fast.

08:24.721 --> 08:25.679
What's this?

08:25.680 --> 08:27.547
What are you doing here?

08:27.548 --> 08:28.759
She's trespassing.

08:29.660 --> 08:31.327
Look, I am sorry to bother you.

08:31.328 --> 08:33.111
This was obviously
a really bad time.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.015
Hold on.

08:34.616 --> 08:36.320
You're Crash's girlfriend.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.385
What's your name again?

08:39.785 --> 08:41.541
- Carter.
- Carter.

08:42.716 --> 08:44.908
You can go.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.301
I don't see a broken car.

08:51.302 --> 08:52.798
What are you doing here?

08:52.799 --> 08:53.660
I came to see Crash.

08:53.961 --> 08:55.204
He's a little busy right now.

08:55.905 --> 08:58.052
Okay, you should go,
I'll talk to you later...

08:58.053 --> 08:58.781
No.

08:58.782 --> 09:00.681
Maybe she should stay.

09:01.282 --> 09:04.572
Someone's listening to my
private business, it concerns me.

09:04.573 --> 09:06.028
She doesn't care what you do.

09:06.029 --> 09:08.312
Maybe she's the reason you're
thinking you're better than me.

09:08.313 --> 09:09.593
He is better than you.

09:09.594 --> 09:10.688
Yeah?

09:11.189 --> 09:12.789
He didn't used to be.

09:13.872 --> 09:15.860
Maybe I should spend
a little time with you.

09:15.861 --> 09:18.314
- I'll get better, too.
- All right, we're done here.

09:18.315 --> 09:19.577
Let's go.

09:19.978 --> 09:22.674
You know, your father tried to
get away from the life, too.

09:22.675 --> 09:24.370
Look what happened to him.

09:24.371 --> 09:25.298
I'm out.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.025
Are you not hearing me?

09:28.433 --> 09:30.858
There is no out.

09:39.050 --> 09:40.673
What happens now?

09:40.674 --> 09:41.234
Clean slate.

09:41.235 --> 09:43.234
You need a new place to live.

09:44.363 --> 09:47.342
I have enough cash
for a night in a motel.

09:47.343 --> 09:49.429
It might not have cable, but...

09:49.430 --> 09:51.263
Then what, Crash?

09:51.264 --> 09:53.062
Sleep in my truck.

09:53.501 --> 09:54.798
Outside?

09:54.799 --> 09:57.806
My dad and I slept
in his truck for a month.

09:57.807 --> 09:58.054
When?

09:58.055 --> 10:00.534
When I was a kid,
before he left for Iraq.

10:01.365 --> 10:03.909
- I was five, I loved it.
- No, that's crazy.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.686
You can't stay in your truck.

10:05.687 --> 10:06.861
No trucks, no motels.

10:06.862 --> 10:09.471
Well, we could
try to make it work here.

10:12.464 --> 10:14.856
You're gonna have to stay
at my house. It's safer.

10:15.357 --> 10:17.036
- Your house?
- Yeah.

10:17.037 --> 10:19.544
And what about
your mom and your dad?

10:19.545 --> 10:21.241
And your sister, who hates me?

10:21.242 --> 10:23.516
Okay, firstly,
she doesn't hate you, Crash.

10:23.517 --> 10:27.192
Secondly, dad will go along
with whatever my mom says.

10:27.193 --> 10:30.044
And my mom will be fine
as long as we tell her about the drugs.

10:30.045 --> 10:31.368
What? No.

10:31.896 --> 10:33.369
- We can't tell her.
- Why?

10:33.370 --> 10:34.651
She's a cop,
she could probably help.

10:34.652 --> 10:36.089
'Cause I'm not a snitch.

10:36.390 --> 10:37.812
And Shay is
right about one thing.

10:37.813 --> 10:39.909
He's the only reason
I'm not in prison.

10:39.910 --> 10:41.356
I'm not gonna
send him to prison.

10:41.357 --> 10:43.181
All right, I won't
tell her about the drugs,

10:43.182 --> 10:44.316
I will just...

10:44.717 --> 10:46.989
Get down on my
knees and beg her.

10:46.990 --> 10:48.928
Carter, I don't think Elizabeth

10:48.929 --> 10:51.232
is gonna listen
to you on this one.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.308
That's a very good point, Max.

10:55.068 --> 10:57.444
I don't think she will listen...

10:58.109 --> 11:00.325
To me.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.012
It's just one night.

11:02.013 --> 11:04.399
Max, you know I would do
anything for you, don't you?

11:04.400 --> 11:07.252
But Crash isn't coming into
my house for one minute.

11:07.253 --> 11:10.159
Elizabeth, you know I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't important.

11:11.159 --> 11:12.113
He's in a lot of trouble.

11:12.114 --> 11:14.290
Some call that an
occupational hazard of

11:14.291 --> 11:15.519
lying, cheating and stealing.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.035
Crash's own uncle
is threatening him.

11:17.036 --> 11:20.450
He can't go back to the place that
he's been living, it's not safe.

11:20.451 --> 11:21.787
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's in danger.

11:21.788 --> 11:23.364
From his uncle?

11:23.365 --> 11:24.907
He's a bad guy.

11:24.908 --> 11:26.107
Well, what kind of danger?

11:26.108 --> 11:27.516
Physical?
Is he being roughed up?

11:27.517 --> 11:29.883
- I probably shouldn't say anymore.
- Why?

11:30.682 --> 11:33.574
Crash, he doesn't want anybody
to know how scared he is.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.214
It's that serious?

11:35.215 --> 11:36.194
More.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.825
Well, I hope he's not
blaming himself,

11:37.826 --> 11:39.121
because I've seen
all kinds of people

11:39.122 --> 11:40.573
in violent-home situations.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.726
He's used to
taking care of himself.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.834
But right now, he's up
against something

11:44.835 --> 11:46.482
that he can't handle alone.

11:47.131 --> 11:48.417
Max...

11:49.386 --> 11:50.850
Crash left you to die.

11:50.851 --> 11:53.029
Why do you care
what happens to him?

11:53.530 --> 11:55.285
I guess...

11:56.333 --> 11:59.445
Somewhere along the way,
we accidentally became friends.

12:08.486 --> 12:09.710
Okay, ground rules.

12:09.711 --> 12:12.933
One, you guys
are all in by curfew.

12:12.934 --> 12:15.090
Two, lights out early.

12:15.591 --> 12:16.813
Three through ten,

12:16.814 --> 12:19.538
Crash sleeps on this mattress.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.699
And not in your bed.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.158
Absolutely, yes.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.682
Check, check, check.

12:23.983 --> 12:25.702
I really appreciate
you for doing this.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.050
And 11 through 20,

12:27.051 --> 12:30.434
you sleep in your bed
and not on this mattress.

12:30.435 --> 12:32.553
<i>Hello, anybody home?</i>

12:32.554 --> 12:33.684
Hi.

12:33.685 --> 12:36.581
Everyone's home.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.129
And not leaving anytime soon.

12:39.130 --> 12:40.416
This isn't for me.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.121
It's for Crash.

12:42.422 --> 12:43.492
That's weird.

12:43.993 --> 12:45.889
You have another
friend named Crash.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.409
Because the Crash I know

12:47.410 --> 12:49.541
would never be
staying in our house.

12:49.542 --> 12:50.885
She's staying here, too.

12:52.577 --> 12:53.913
I don't understand.

12:53.914 --> 12:55.817
- I've been away one night.
- What happened?

12:55.818 --> 12:57.219
I...

12:57.720 --> 12:59.477
I think you got this one.

12:59.978 --> 13:00.889
Elizabeth?

13:00.890 --> 13:02.908
Crash is in trouble,
he needs a place to sleep

13:02.909 --> 13:04.393
and I told him he
could stay here,

13:04.394 --> 13:07.310
but as long as he's here,
I'm staying so I can watch him.

13:07.311 --> 13:08.615
You should have called.

13:08.616 --> 13:10.374
It just happened.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.734
We talked about this
you're not the only parent here.

13:12.735 --> 13:14.875
David, please.
Don't be sensitive.

13:14.876 --> 13:16.320
I'm not being sensitive.

13:16.321 --> 13:18.787
Okay, now you're being sensitive
about being sensitive.

13:18.788 --> 13:20.739
I'm quickly remembering
why we decided to have

13:20.740 --> 13:22.596
separate nights
in the first place.

13:22.597 --> 13:25.654
- You know what? I'll go.
- No, no, wait. Don't.

13:25.655 --> 13:27.919
You're right, I'm sorry.

13:28.511 --> 13:30.409
I should have called.

13:30.980 --> 13:32.747
That's okay.

13:33.507 --> 13:35.435
- It just happened.
- Yeah.

13:35.436 --> 13:38.179
I'll explain over
a glass of wine.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.458
Or six.

13:39.859 --> 13:42.439
And then we gotta figure out
sleeping arrangements.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.207
Carter and Crash's?

13:44.208 --> 13:46.183
Ours.

13:56.616 --> 13:58.634
I just wanted to say hi.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.480
Hi.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.399
The full house tonight.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.703
I heard.

14:09.627 --> 14:11.851
You making something
special for dinner?

14:12.279 --> 14:15.322
I'm making myself
disappear for dinner.

14:15.323 --> 14:17.512
You look really nice...

14:17.513 --> 14:19.267
For your vanishing act.

14:19.268 --> 14:20.611
Thanks.

14:20.612 --> 14:22.678
Yeah, it's different.

14:22.679 --> 14:23.695
But nice.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.372
You feel like
disappearing with me

14:26.373 --> 14:27.944
over to Bird's place
for a little bit?

14:27.945 --> 14:29.435
Thanks, but, um...

14:29.436 --> 14:30.691
I already have plans.

14:30.692 --> 14:33.723
A magician never reveals
her secrets, right?

14:35.447 --> 14:37.236
I'm hanging out with Ofe.

14:39.472 --> 14:41.604
So you guys are hanging out.

14:41.605 --> 14:44.263
I guess you had a better time
than the rest of us at the fair.

14:44.264 --> 14:45.499
Not really.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.580
He spent the whole time
trying to win that.

14:48.156 --> 14:50.857
That's not exactly my thing,
but Ofe must really like you.

14:50.858 --> 14:52.130
We're just having fun.

14:52.131 --> 14:54.191
What does "having fun" mean?

14:54.192 --> 14:55.618
Do you really want the details?

14:55.619 --> 14:57.418
So you don't actually
like Ofe then?

14:57.419 --> 14:58.465
What's the difference?

14:58.466 --> 15:00.297
Well, it seems like
there's a big difference.

15:00.298 --> 15:02.410
Do you want me to like Ofe?

15:03.230 --> 15:05.462
You know, I just didn't
think of you as that...

15:05.463 --> 15:06.486
As what?

15:06.487 --> 15:08.718
- Nothing.
- No, as what, Max?

15:08.719 --> 15:10.781
Well, as the kind of person that would
do something like that

15:10.782 --> 15:12.543
with someone you
don't really care about.

15:12.544 --> 15:15.004
What about you and Bird?
How is that any different?

15:15.005 --> 15:17.167
- Bird is my roommate.
- That makes it worse.

15:17.168 --> 15:19.584
But Bird and I aren't
doing anything.

15:21.256 --> 15:23.784
Why am I even having
this conversation?

15:23.785 --> 15:25.989
I don't care what
you think about me.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.559
I'm going to
have some fun with Ofe.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.638
Hopefully, I can avoid
running into the guy

15:30.639 --> 15:32.235
that shot you on my way out.

15:32.236 --> 15:33.798
- Come on, Taylor.
- No.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.734
It's time for
your vanishing act.

16:13.971 --> 16:15.819
Okay, so my dad
was only expecting

16:15.820 --> 16:16.409
four people for dinner,

16:16.410 --> 16:20.402
so I think we're gonna
have to ration the stir-fry.

16:22.770 --> 16:24.203
Yep.

16:24.204 --> 16:26.378
I vote for adding ramen.

16:26.379 --> 16:28.994
It's like the weed of
the pasta family.

16:32.587 --> 16:34.294
Look at you.

16:35.854 --> 16:38.246
You know, scrounging is my
superhero skill after all.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.319
Really?

16:39.320 --> 16:40.846
I'd call it...

16:40.847 --> 16:42.647
Doing a lot with a little.

16:42.648 --> 16:46.872
That's because your superhero skill
is seeing the silver lining.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.281
What, like...

16:49.282 --> 16:53.254
How even though the reason
you're here is kinda screwed up,

16:53.255 --> 16:55.301
this might just
end up being fun.

16:55.302 --> 16:57.877
The scrounger and the optimist.

16:58.678 --> 17:00.556
I smell a franchise.

17:01.556 --> 17:02.978
Here, can you wash this?

17:07.280 --> 17:08.530
What?

17:10.538 --> 17:11.914
I just can't believe I'm here

17:11.915 --> 17:13.671
and your mom's not
throwing me out.

17:13.672 --> 17:15.773
Yes, I can't
believe that either.

17:16.175 --> 17:18.333
Did you tell her
that it means a lot?

17:18.334 --> 17:20.458
You tell her, she'd
really appreciate it.

17:21.258 --> 17:22.979
I really appreciate you.

17:25.897 --> 17:27.041
Carter?

17:28.178 --> 17:29.322
Hi.

17:30.322 --> 17:31.394
Hi.

17:31.395 --> 17:33.489
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

17:33.921 --> 17:36.041
What's going on here?

17:36.042 --> 17:38.162
Um, we're making dinner.

17:38.163 --> 17:39.395
I don't think so.

17:39.396 --> 17:41.570
It's not date night for you two,

17:41.571 --> 17:43.111
it's not any night for you two.

17:43.112 --> 17:45.174
Mom, no one thinks
this is date night.

17:45.175 --> 17:48.086
Good, because the second it starts
looking like a date in here again,

17:48.087 --> 17:50.571
you're gonna find another
place to stay, Crash.

17:50.572 --> 17:53.222
Carter, he's not here
because he is your boyfriend.

17:53.223 --> 17:57.551
He is here because he needs our help.
Do you understand that?

17:57.552 --> 17:59.050
- Yeah.
- Good.

17:59.051 --> 18:00.023
Crash?

18:00.024 --> 18:01.479
Yes, ma'am.

18:02.742 --> 18:06.182
And don't even think about putting
your overnight bag in Carter's room.

18:09.466 --> 18:11.362
And stay away from Grant.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.194
Well...

18:16.195 --> 18:19.267
Every superhero needs a villain.

18:27.387 --> 18:29.962
Clearly, I've developed
a Pavlovian response

18:29.963 --> 18:32.003
to studying European history.

18:32.004 --> 18:34.010
Euro history makes you salivate.

18:34.011 --> 18:35.026
That...

18:35.627 --> 18:38.059
And it makes me want to
take your clothes off.

18:38.060 --> 18:40.590
Well, the French
would be so proud.

18:40.591 --> 18:42.758
I think it makes me hungry.

18:43.159 --> 18:44.999
- Right now?
- Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.206
I haven't eaten all day.

18:46.207 --> 18:48.757
I've been working up
quite the appetite.

18:48.758 --> 18:50.656
The last 20 minutes.

18:51.457 --> 18:53.320
Or... should I say ten?

18:53.321 --> 18:54.429
12.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.952
Hey, anyway, if you're hungry,

18:56.953 --> 18:59.800
why don't you help me solve
one of life's biggest mysteries?

18:59.801 --> 19:02.232
What's the perfect post hookup,

19:02.233 --> 19:03.897
pre-study sandwich?

19:03.898 --> 19:05.463
What are the contenders?

19:05.464 --> 19:08.209
Turkey Reuben, Turkey Reuben.

19:08.641 --> 19:10.418
- And Turkey Reuben.
- Nope.

19:10.419 --> 19:13.249
The Tryptophan
would make me sleepy.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.866
I say... the Elvis.

19:15.867 --> 19:20.122
Bananas, peanut butter,
bacon, fried.

19:20.123 --> 19:21.137
Okay.

19:21.138 --> 19:22.541
Well, that sounds great,

19:22.542 --> 19:24.313
but of course, the perfect
sandwich is actually

19:24.314 --> 19:26.056
the one we happen
to have ingredients for.

19:26.057 --> 19:27.193
Why is that?

19:27.194 --> 19:29.536
Because I have to be
able to make it right now.

19:29.537 --> 19:31.284
Are you gonna
make me a sandwich?

19:31.285 --> 19:34.367
Isn't that one of the known benefits
of being friends with benefits?

19:34.368 --> 19:36.238
Well, if it isn't...

19:36.662 --> 19:38.317
Let's be rebels.

19:38.318 --> 19:39.677
I think I've got bit makings.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.165
It's not exactly
European, but tasty.

19:44.287 --> 19:45.741
Taylor.

19:45.742 --> 19:47.270
Taylor!

19:48.830 --> 19:50.581
Want some help?

19:54.681 --> 19:57.425
By the way, is the
living room still okay?

19:57.426 --> 19:59.869
Or should we go ahead and put Crash in
solitary confinement?

19:59.870 --> 20:02.598
Maybe feed him his meals
through a slot in the door.

20:02.599 --> 20:03.558
Carter.

20:03.559 --> 20:06.778
Look, I really appreciate
everything you're doing for him,

20:06.779 --> 20:08.587
but I don't understand
why you have to be so hard on him.

20:08.588 --> 20:12.083
What, by feeding him and letting him
stay here, in our home?

20:12.084 --> 20:14.003
No, I mean, like treating
him like he's a criminal.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.713
He is a criminal.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.151
He was a criminal.

20:17.551 --> 20:18.775
Now he just wants a clean slate,

20:18.776 --> 20:21.503
and I think, after
everything he's been through,

20:21.504 --> 20:22.702
he should get that chance.

20:23.167 --> 20:25.007
- He won't.
- Why?

20:25.008 --> 20:28.567
Because, sweetheart,
there are no clean slates.

20:29.135 --> 20:31.527
Not for any of us.

20:34.158 --> 20:35.319
You want some help with those?

20:35.320 --> 20:37.837
No, no, no,
I got it, Mr. Wilson.

20:37.838 --> 20:39.185
So now, whoever cooks

20:39.490 --> 20:40.985
is supposed to be off dish duty.

20:40.986 --> 20:41.593
House rules.

20:41.594 --> 20:44.777
Those rules apply to an
unwelcome house guest?

20:44.778 --> 20:46.009
Who says you're not welcome?

20:46.010 --> 20:49.185
It's kinda written all
over Mrs. Wilson's face.

20:49.186 --> 20:50.161
Don't take it too personally.

20:50.162 --> 20:53.745
She might be a little biased
against people she's arrested.

20:53.746 --> 20:56.833
Or whoever rolled
oregano joints in her home?

20:56.834 --> 20:59.001
Not your best.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.725
Not my best.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.533
Well, I have my own bias.

21:02.534 --> 21:04.677
- Against what?
- Not against.

21:04.678 --> 21:09.949
Toward... people who try to
make up for their mistakes,

21:09.950 --> 21:13.133
and toward people
who love my daughter.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.369
So he'll always
be a criminal to you.

21:16.370 --> 21:18.821
You'll never accept him
as what he is now

21:18.822 --> 21:20.069
because of what he once was.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.777
No.

21:23.778 --> 21:25.210
I'm not going to accept him

21:25.211 --> 21:28.345
because he's going to
break your heart.

21:28.346 --> 21:31.121
And I don't
want you to get hurt.

21:32.397 --> 21:35.389
Mom, I think you're the one
who's afraid of heartbreak.

21:37.006 --> 21:39.709
You just can't be any more.

21:40.093 --> 21:42.453
None of us can.

21:42.941 --> 21:45.653
We've been through
everything in this family,

21:45.654 --> 21:47.486
we have survived it all.

21:47.997 --> 21:51.142
Seriously, what's
left to be afraid of?

21:58.653 --> 22:00.462
Can I help you?

22:03.189 --> 22:05.905
I'm here to pick up my nephew.

22:10.552 --> 22:12.108
What can we help you with?

22:12.109 --> 22:13.065
I'm here to talk to Crash.

22:13.066 --> 22:16.025
We understand there's been
a disagreement of some kind.

22:16.026 --> 22:17.277
That's a family matter.

22:17.278 --> 22:18.588
Not anymore.

22:20.610 --> 22:22.193
I can't believe you came here.

22:22.194 --> 22:23.224
How did he find out?

22:23.225 --> 22:25.361
I think he might have found you.

22:25.362 --> 22:26.457
That's mildly disturbing.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.382
I'm not looking to
start anything.

22:28.383 --> 22:29.773
Folks, just let me
talk to my nephew.

22:29.774 --> 22:32.120
- Shay, what are you doing here?
- Crash, stay there.

22:32.521 --> 22:34.968
Crash, you're bothering
these nice people.

22:34.969 --> 22:36.712
Let's get your things.

22:36.713 --> 22:37.821
I'll take it from here.

22:38.222 --> 22:40.285
Crash, you should
get inside now.

22:40.286 --> 22:42.198
He's not going with you.

22:42.741 --> 22:44.116
I don't think you understand.

22:44.117 --> 22:47.117
I'm telling you both to
go back to your business.

22:47.118 --> 22:50.469
First of all, you don't
tell me what to do.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.558
You're on my property,

22:51.559 --> 22:54.093
asking to speak to
someone in my house,

22:54.094 --> 22:55.221
so that makes it my business.

22:55.222 --> 22:59.349
I just hope it doesn't end up
overlapping with my day job.

23:00.458 --> 23:01.501
Cop?

23:01.502 --> 23:02.937
Detective.

23:05.937 --> 23:07.808
Look, I just want to
make sure my nephew

23:07.809 --> 23:09.680
wasn't gonna be
a bother, that's all.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.686
He's welcome here.

23:11.687 --> 23:13.657
But you need to leave.

23:14.449 --> 23:17.553
Crash, you call me when you
want to come home and talk.

23:18.497 --> 23:22.121
But you shouldn't talk to
anyone else in the meantime.

23:22.122 --> 23:23.769
You wouldn't want to bother them

23:23.770 --> 23:26.210
any more than you already have.

23:26.986 --> 23:29.113
Got it?

23:46.337 --> 23:47.862
Thanks.

23:48.463 --> 23:50.518
I'll be down
after I check on Grant.

23:50.519 --> 23:51.533
Thanks.

23:54.582 --> 23:56.765
I'm really sorry
about all of that.

23:56.766 --> 23:58.030
It's not your fault, Crash.

23:58.031 --> 24:01.909
But you need to tell me
what's really going on now.

24:01.910 --> 24:02.919
I can't.

24:02.920 --> 24:06.302
I can't help you if you don't let me.
No one can.

24:06.303 --> 24:08.711
Mom, you heard what Shay said
he was threatening him.

24:08.712 --> 24:10.358
Well, Crash wasn't
the only person

24:10.359 --> 24:12.958
that Shay was threatening
by showing up here tonight.

24:12.959 --> 24:14.990
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

24:14.991 --> 24:17.470
Listen. If you're worried because
you're part of something...

24:17.471 --> 24:19.270
He wasn't part of something.

24:21.066 --> 24:22.531
Shay's my only family.

24:22.532 --> 24:24.350
He gave me a second chance.

24:24.851 --> 24:28.826
But you don't owe a man
like that anything, Crash.

24:28.827 --> 24:30.423
Family matters.

24:30.918 --> 24:34.203
But sometimes, they don't always know
what's best for us.

24:35.004 --> 24:37.467
You need to tell me
what you know.

24:40.220 --> 24:41.827
I shouldn't have come here.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.251
- Crash, you don't need to say anything.
- No, Carter.

24:44.252 --> 24:46.987
I don't care about anyone
the way I care about you.

24:48.091 --> 24:50.938
And nobody has made me
a better person than you.

24:51.839 --> 24:55.586
It's not okay to come here
and threaten this family.

24:57.181 --> 25:00.462
Shay's real name is
Walter Chase.

25:04.309 --> 25:05.614
No, it's fine.

25:05.615 --> 25:08.557
Don't worry, it's not for you.

25:12.854 --> 25:14.085
I don't get it.

25:14.586 --> 25:16.551
One second,
we're talking sandwiches,

25:16.552 --> 25:18.982
and the next thing
I know... boom.

25:18.983 --> 25:20.198
What do you think happened?

25:20.199 --> 25:20.997
No idea.

25:20.998 --> 25:22.733
- We should get you to a doctor.
- No.

25:22.734 --> 25:23.386
No, no, no, I'm...

25:23.387 --> 25:27.378
I'm fine, I'm just
tired and nauseous.

25:27.379 --> 25:28.593
Nausea.

25:30.282 --> 25:31.585
Fatigue.

25:31.586 --> 25:34.314
Craving that weird
peanut butter sandwich.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.122
What?

25:35.523 --> 25:36.962
What if you're pregnant?

25:36.963 --> 25:38.278
- Not a chance.
- How do you know?

25:38.279 --> 25:39.321
Because I know.

25:39.322 --> 25:41.434
Well, if that is the case,
you should know,

25:41.435 --> 25:42.731
I'd make a great dad.

25:42.732 --> 25:43.936
Double the role models.

25:43.937 --> 25:45.706
Ofe, I'm not pregnant.

25:45.707 --> 25:46.450
Seriously.

25:46.451 --> 25:48.634
People don't just get dizzy
and faint out of nowhere,

25:48.635 --> 25:49.810
though, so it has to be...

25:50.186 --> 25:52.444
I think that it was
just a weird reaction

25:52.445 --> 25:53.805
to the study buddies I took.

25:53.806 --> 25:55.286
It's no big deal.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.133
You took something?

25:56.134 --> 25:58.367
Yeah, before I came here.

25:58.368 --> 25:59.124
Why?

25:59.125 --> 26:00.837
Why do you think?

26:00.838 --> 26:01.916
Well, I have no idea.

26:01.917 --> 26:03.830
Since when did you start using?

26:03.831 --> 26:05.709
Since what's the difference?

26:05.710 --> 26:06.221
Where'd you get it?

26:06.822 --> 26:08.292
It really doesn't matter.

26:08.293 --> 26:09.021
It does.

26:09.022 --> 26:12.061
There are some seriously bad
pills out there, all right?

26:12.062 --> 26:12.744
And I really think we should

26:12.745 --> 26:14.972
- take you to a doctor...
- The pills were fine.

26:14.973 --> 26:15.730
And how do you know that?

26:15.731 --> 26:18.107
- Because I do.
- Okay, but how?

26:18.108 --> 26:19.602
Because they were yours!

26:22.091 --> 26:23.586
You stole my stash?

26:23.587 --> 26:25.530
You can get more
anytime you want.

26:25.531 --> 26:28.179
I know, but that's not the point.
Why didn't you just ask me?

26:28.180 --> 26:30.454
Because if I had asked you,
you would have said no.

26:30.455 --> 26:31.726
Right, because
you don't need them.

26:31.727 --> 26:33.316
How do you know what I need?

26:33.317 --> 26:35.303
Well, Taylor, this is not you.

26:35.304 --> 26:37.455
What do you even know about me?

26:37.456 --> 26:39.439
You're not my boyfriend.

26:44.783 --> 26:47.160
Clearly not.

26:50.454 --> 26:51.852
Uncle Shay has an alias

26:51.853 --> 26:53.056
for every day of the week.

26:53.057 --> 26:53.648
I just found three more.

26:53.649 --> 26:56.310
I guess if I made a living
out of identity theft

26:56.311 --> 26:57.899
<i>and gun and drug trafficking,</i>

26:57.900 --> 26:58.571
I would, too.

26:58.572 --> 27:00.967
- Do we have enough for a warrant?
- <i>I think so.</i>

27:00.968 --> 27:02.041
Kid really came through?

27:02.499 --> 27:04.105
I guess I was wrong about him.

27:04.106 --> 27:05.723
I guess we'll see.

27:07.106 --> 27:08.146
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

27:08.147 --> 27:10.403
Listen, I can't talk right now.

27:10.404 --> 27:11.810
I'll call you back later.

27:28.158 --> 27:30.470
Do you really think he would
try and hurt you, Crash?

27:30.471 --> 27:33.722
He's not the type to make
empty threats, believe me.

27:34.082 --> 27:36.226
Okay, well, he can't
touch you from jail.

27:36.227 --> 27:36.986
He has people, Carter.

27:36.987 --> 27:39.042
As soon as he finds out I talked,
they'll come for me.

27:39.043 --> 27:41.405
Okay, well then, we need
to talk to the police.

27:41.406 --> 27:43.071
And tell them you
need some kind of protection.

27:43.072 --> 27:44.903
I might need protection
from the cops, too.

27:44.904 --> 27:47.225
- Why?
- They could still say I was

27:47.226 --> 27:48.001
part of Shay's operation.

27:48.002 --> 27:49.217
But you had
nothing to do with it.

27:49.218 --> 27:51.593
With a past like mine,
you really think a judge

27:51.594 --> 27:52.666
is gonna believe me?

27:52.667 --> 27:53.582
Come on.

27:54.383 --> 27:56.017
Even you didn't.

27:57.029 --> 27:59.260
So what are you gonna do?

28:04.612 --> 28:06.412
I think I have to leave.

28:06.413 --> 28:07.612
What, like leave town?

28:07.613 --> 28:09.364
Shay tracked me to your house.

28:09.365 --> 28:12.085
I stay anywhere around here
and he can find me.

28:12.086 --> 28:12.748
Where would you go?

28:12.749 --> 28:15.061
- Not sure yet.
- Alone?

28:15.062 --> 28:16.450
I'll be okay.

28:16.451 --> 28:17.205
How, Crash?

28:17.206 --> 28:19.356
By sleeping in your truck?

28:19.357 --> 28:21.257
You don't have anywhere to go.

28:21.913 --> 28:24.457
You don't have a job,
you don't have anything.

28:25.184 --> 28:27.774
Hey, I could always go back
to doing what I do best.

28:27.775 --> 28:29.965
And the benefits aren't
great, but it pays well.

28:29.966 --> 28:31.504
That's not funny.

28:36.232 --> 28:37.648
I know.

28:38.449 --> 28:39.569
Maybe Shay is right.

28:39.770 --> 28:42.064
People like me don't get
to decide our futures.

28:42.065 --> 28:44.193
I don't believe
that for a second.

28:44.194 --> 28:45.969
- Carter.
- Crash.

28:45.970 --> 28:48.834
Do you really think
I don't get having

28:48.835 --> 28:51.664
absolutely no idea
what comes next?

28:52.386 --> 28:55.097
For the past year,
my entire life has been

28:55.098 --> 28:57.673
one new future after the other.

28:57.674 --> 28:58.401
I know.

28:58.402 --> 29:00.246
But I figure it out.

29:00.747 --> 29:03.553
Because people
like us always do that.

29:03.554 --> 29:05.897
And you know what?

29:06.305 --> 29:09.381
We are going to
figure this out together.

29:36.237 --> 29:37.596
Hey.

29:37.597 --> 29:39.293
You okay out here?

29:39.294 --> 29:40.789
Yeah.

29:40.790 --> 29:42.677
Thanks.

29:44.605 --> 29:45.762
Are you okay?

29:45.763 --> 29:49.798
Well, for a nesting married woman
who's sleeping in a house

29:49.799 --> 29:52.903
with the husband
she's separated from,

29:52.904 --> 29:54.341
I couldn't be better.

29:56.167 --> 29:58.879
Hey, do you remember that

29:59.366 --> 30:02.526
fleabag motel in Hawaii?

30:02.527 --> 30:03.118
Yeah.

30:03.119 --> 30:05.126
That was horrible.

30:05.927 --> 30:07.410
We had to sleep in the bathtub.

30:07.411 --> 30:09.893
- We survived that, too.
- Yeah.

30:10.594 --> 30:14.098
I'm glad that we were both
here for all that tonight.

30:14.099 --> 30:15.353
Me too.

30:15.354 --> 30:19.299
Reminds me what
a great team we once were.

30:22.219 --> 30:24.945
Feels like a long time ago.

30:25.746 --> 30:29.050
It does,
but if we focus on it...

30:30.122 --> 30:32.769
Remember what we had.

30:35.530 --> 30:38.162
Well, the problem is...

30:38.863 --> 30:42.537
It's not the only
thing that I remember.

30:42.538 --> 30:43.302
There's so much pain,

30:43.303 --> 30:47.126
even when I think about
the good times. It just...

30:47.127 --> 30:50.846
Brings me to someplace terrible.

30:54.278 --> 30:56.272
You.

30:57.190 --> 31:00.317
Lori and losing Carter.

31:02.077 --> 31:05.590
It's not over for me.

31:06.303 --> 31:09.286
I don't think it ever will be.

31:09.287 --> 31:11.965
I am so sorry, Liz.

31:11.966 --> 31:14.821
I just want some peace.

31:14.822 --> 31:17.642
I want that for you.

31:17.643 --> 31:20.041
Right now...

31:20.042 --> 31:24.642
I'm thinking
the only thing to do...

31:26.338 --> 31:29.442
Is move forward.

31:35.225 --> 31:37.419
I don't want a divorce, Liz.

31:39.778 --> 31:43.382
I'm so sorry, David.

31:44.174 --> 31:46.870
I tried.

31:47.371 --> 31:49.519
I really tried.

31:58.528 --> 31:59.309
What?

31:59.310 --> 32:01.431
So Taylor took your stash?

32:01.432 --> 32:02.918
Okay, we need Tequila.

32:02.919 --> 32:05.279
It's not funny, Bird.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.151
Well, the good thing
about Tequila

32:07.152 --> 32:08.989
is that it goes
with every emotion.

32:10.556 --> 32:11.942
Didn't know we had company.

32:11.943 --> 32:12.870
Perfect.

32:12.871 --> 32:14.053
We'll start with beer.

32:14.054 --> 32:15.845
Then we'll be in the clear.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.205
That's how
the saying goes, right?

32:19.245 --> 32:20.973
What's the occasion?

32:20.974 --> 32:22.102
Taylor fainted today.

32:22.103 --> 32:25.741
She popped some study buddies.

32:26.434 --> 32:28.097
Taylor fainted from pills?

32:28.098 --> 32:29.929
Yeah, so we needed
a drink to process.

32:29.930 --> 32:33.273
I thought we were working on
not blurting things out.

32:33.274 --> 32:34.321
Right.

32:34.322 --> 32:36.153
And... so how was your day, Max?

32:36.154 --> 32:38.585
No, no, no, you tell me
what the hell happened.

32:38.586 --> 32:39.977
Look, Max, she got
dizzy, all right?

32:39.978 --> 32:42.297
- It's not a big deal.
- Okay, where is she now?

32:42.298 --> 32:43.258
She's at home now, she's okay.

32:43.259 --> 32:46.751
She fainted from pills that you gave her,
clearly, she's not okay.

32:46.752 --> 32:48.844
Well, I didn't give her
the pills, Max.

32:48.845 --> 32:50.770
I didn't even know
she was taking them.

32:50.771 --> 32:52.606
How the hell is
that even possible?

32:52.607 --> 32:53.807
You're a prescription
drug dealer.

32:53.808 --> 32:56.167
I've been asking
myself that all night.

32:56.879 --> 32:57.902
You know what, man?

32:57.903 --> 33:00.388
If you're gonna get
the benefits,

33:00.389 --> 33:02.839
maybe try being a friend, too.

33:07.587 --> 33:09.450
Hey, Carter?

33:50.959 --> 33:52.663
Crash?

34:40.335 --> 34:42.679
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.739
You sent me like 20 texts.

34:44.741 --> 34:46.766
It wasn't exactly unannounced.

34:46.768 --> 34:48.607
Well, you didn't answer.

34:49.101 --> 34:51.598
Because I didn't
want to be lectured,

34:51.599 --> 34:52.621
and I still don't.

34:52.623 --> 34:55.614
I'm not here to lecture you.

34:57.194 --> 34:59.022
Thanks.

34:59.023 --> 35:02.416
My dad's here,
so we can't exactly...

35:02.417 --> 35:05.775
I'm not here to
not study with you.

35:05.776 --> 35:07.227
In fact, whatever it is

35:07.228 --> 35:09.656
we've been doing
has been great, Tay,

35:09.657 --> 35:10.944
but I can't anymore.

35:10.945 --> 35:14.840
But... I'm sorry, isn't that a
little hypocritical of you?

35:15.150 --> 35:17.111
You're a drug dealer
and you're ending things

35:17.112 --> 35:18.214
because I took some pills?

35:18.215 --> 35:19.917
I'm ending things
because I think

35:19.918 --> 35:21.662
you might break my heart.

35:21.663 --> 35:22.870
I don't understand.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.632
I see people using all the time.

35:25.633 --> 35:28.216
I know every effect
the drugs have.

35:28.217 --> 35:31.006
- I know when people are on pills.
- But?

35:31.007 --> 35:33.165
But I didn't know you were.

35:33.166 --> 35:33.574
So what?

35:33.575 --> 35:35.981
So I had blinders on.

35:36.646 --> 35:39.398
And the only explanation
for why...

35:40.303 --> 35:42.154
I care about you too much.

35:42.155 --> 35:45.171
Okay, but I care about you, too.

35:45.172 --> 35:48.154
You're not
falling in love with me.

35:48.577 --> 35:50.050
And since I...

35:50.051 --> 35:52.498
I think you still
have feelings for Max,

35:52.873 --> 35:54.626
and I know he has
them for you...

35:55.594 --> 36:00.426
I think it's
time I opened my eyes.

36:00.427 --> 36:01.754
No, you're wrong.

36:03.466 --> 36:05.770
Max doesn't
have feelings for me.

36:06.586 --> 36:09.906
But you do, for him.

36:10.833 --> 36:11.966
Hey, look.

36:11.967 --> 36:15.927
If you ever decide you're
ready for more than benefits,

36:16.573 --> 36:20.085
remember, we've only made
it to the Middle Ages.

36:20.086 --> 36:21.302
The Renaissance is next,

36:21.303 --> 36:24.593
and it'll blow your damn mind.

36:39.969 --> 36:41.225
Backup in position.

36:41.226 --> 36:42.921
<i>That's affirmative, you're a go.</i>

36:42.922 --> 36:44.121
Unlock it.

36:44.122 --> 36:45.023
Go!

36:45.058 --> 36:47.532
Police! We have a warrant!

36:47.533 --> 36:49.973
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

36:51.173 --> 36:52.350
Check the back room!

36:54.639 --> 36:57.183
- Move around!
- Room's clear!

36:57.184 --> 36:57.983
There's no one here.

36:57.984 --> 37:00.152
Get ID to check for prints.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.807
They cleaned.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.935
Yeah, I can see my
reflection in the doorknobs.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.655
We're not gonna find
anything here.

37:11.656 --> 37:14.279
They felt the heat
and they walked away.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.203
Or someone tipped them off.

37:21.043 --> 37:21.819
Hey.

37:21.820 --> 37:23.516
Where's Crash?

37:26.339 --> 37:28.234
He's gone.

37:32.267 --> 37:34.459
So is Shay.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.675
We think that someone

37:35.676 --> 37:37.715
tipped him off
that we were coming.

37:37.716 --> 37:39.243
You think it was Crash?

37:39.244 --> 37:41.707
Baby, I don't
know what to think.

37:41.708 --> 37:42.547
It wasn't.

37:42.548 --> 37:44.003
Here.

37:45.931 --> 37:48.492
Go ahead, you can read it.

38:05.027 --> 38:08.231
I am so sorry, honey.

38:20.257 --> 38:21.599
You sure about this?

38:21.600 --> 38:22.847
Getting sure.

38:22.848 --> 38:23.711
Maybe you'll get to see

38:23.712 --> 38:25.352
some cool parts of the world,

38:25.353 --> 38:26.959
like Bulgaria and Taiwan.

38:28.583 --> 38:30.839
Those always seemed
like cool places to me.

38:30.840 --> 38:31.775
Yeah.

38:31.776 --> 38:34.883
Maybe I'll finally get
a fresh start somewhere.

38:43.972 --> 38:45.690
That's my cue.

38:48.699 --> 38:49.883
Wait.

38:49.884 --> 38:51.395
Almost forgot.

38:51.396 --> 38:52.915
Can't take this where I'm going.

38:52.916 --> 38:56.731
And a stash is a terrible
thing to waste.

38:59.251 --> 39:00.419
Hey.

39:00.420 --> 39:02.475
Good luck.

39:03.622 --> 39:05.239
Thanks.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.087
<i>"Dear Carter,"</i>

39:19.088 --> 39:21.734
<i>"leaving you is the hardest
thing I've ever done."</i>

39:27.496 --> 39:30.199
<i>"You have to know
how much I love you."</i>

39:34.171 --> 39:36.519
<i>"How much I would do for you..."</i>

39:45.731 --> 39:48.963
<i>"... but this is
the only way out for me."</i>

39:48.964 --> 39:52.555
<i>"This is the only
way I know to start over."</i>

39:58.275 --> 40:01.891
<i>"You changed my life more than
I knew was possible."</i>

40:07.819 --> 40:11.201
<i>"You helped me get here."</i>

40:22.919 --> 40:24.199
<i>"I love you."</i>

40:24.200 --> 40:27.407
<i>"I'll be back for you,
I promise."</i>

40:27.983 --> 40:33.255
<i>"Crash."</i>
