<i>Kids my age,</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:40.206
<i>they say the future is fluid.</i>

00:40.290 --> 00:42.890
- This was inside?
- Yeah, just laying on top.

00:43.918 --> 00:48.506
<i>Those old ideas of what it is
to be a man or a woman are going away.</i>

00:51.468 --> 00:52.635
<i>I believe it's true.</i>

00:54.554 --> 00:55.597
<i>I hope it is.</i>

00:57.223 --> 00:58.516
<i>But we're not there yet.</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:01.046
Make sure you get that.

01:01.811 --> 01:04.438
I'm gonna take my kid
home. I'll be right back, okay?

01:04.522 --> 01:05.899
- Take your time.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.363
You okay, buddy?

01:13.865 --> 01:16.534
- I think so. It's just a lot.
- Yeah.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.912
Yeah. Well, let's get you home.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.126
Did you find any, like, clues or whatever?

01:26.169 --> 01:27.670
Well, I mean, you know,

01:27.754 --> 01:30.131
we try to put together
everything we can, but...

01:31.382 --> 01:33.843
you don't know what the clues are
until you know the crime.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.018
Plenty of boys think
there's not much choice at all.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.395
They have to be strong...

01:46.314 --> 01:47.315
<i>...and stoic...</i>

02:46.749 --> 02:47.749
Hello?

02:49.711 --> 02:50.837
Hello, Sheriff.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.884
And where did you find it?

02:59.637 --> 03:00.637
I see.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.518
No. No, I don't know the place.
He never mentioned it.

03:09.772 --> 03:10.773
I understand.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.193
Yes, that's fine.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.157
I don't know, um...

03:19.699 --> 03:24.579
I know my son did drugs on occasion,
but I never saw steroids.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.006
You haven't mentioned if...

03:36.633 --> 03:38.551
there was evidence he was harmed.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.025
That boy Clay Jensen...

03:54.943 --> 03:56.611
you'll talk to him again, I hope?

03:59.322 --> 04:00.323
Thank you, Sheriff.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.701
Hey! Keep your mind on the medicine.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.453
Yes, Mum.

04:06.913 --> 04:10.333
Keep your head down,
and leave this woman to her grief.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.048
- Amara Josephine?
- Yes?

04:17.839 --> 04:19.926
They found blood on the ground.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.928
Oh, no. Upstairs.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.973
Someone hurt my son.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.891
Oh, dear God.

04:45.159 --> 04:48.371
We both know that's where
this whole story begins and ends.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.040
<i>With boys trying to be men.</i>

04:51.708 --> 04:53.626
<i>And everyone they hurt along the way.</i>

04:55.336 --> 04:56.546
<i>Everyone they hurt.</i>

04:58.214 --> 04:59.882
<i>Including their own damn selves.</i>

05:06.514 --> 05:07.514
Fuck!

05:09.225 --> 05:10.226
Fuck!

05:13.855 --> 05:15.523
Hey, Jess...

05:18.026 --> 05:19.569
Justin, they found Bryce's...

05:22.113 --> 05:24.532
What the hell?

05:25.283 --> 05:29.078
Uh, it's Jess.
Jess has just... she lost an earring.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.249
- Yeah...
- Justin, what the fuck?

05:37.170 --> 05:40.089
Uh, I... I'll call you back, okay?

05:40.798 --> 05:42.759
I thought you got rid of it last night.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.263
First guy didn't work out, okay?
I will... I got it.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.601
- You can't just leave it lying around!
- Just chill. I got it.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.522
They found his Range Rover
and blood on the ground.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.815
They're calling it a homicide.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.945
- Fuck!
- They found drugs

06:03.029 --> 06:04.029
and...

06:04.447 --> 06:06.074
- fingerprints.
- Drugs? What...

06:07.241 --> 06:08.409
What drugs?

06:08.493 --> 06:11.204
She didn't say, but they found
fingerprints that weren't his.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.872
Okay, well...

06:15.792 --> 06:16.876
That's all right, right?

06:17.460 --> 06:18.461
It's a car.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.671
It's got a ton of fingerprints.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.595
He probably drove
his Hillcrest friends around.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.425
Justin, my prints could be on it.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.052
Did you kill him?

06:26.761 --> 06:27.595
Of course not.

06:27.678 --> 06:28.930
Then don't worry about it.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.016
You don't...

06:34.227 --> 06:36.267
You don't want to know
why my prints could be on it?

06:36.687 --> 06:39.065
No, I really don't.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.457
How are you feeling today, Dad?

06:58.042 --> 07:00.628
Amara Josephine says
you've not much of an appetite.

07:00.711 --> 07:04.799
It's those West Indies spices
she puts in everything.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.134
She's Kenyan, Dad,

07:06.926 --> 07:08.052
by way of the UK.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.515
And I don't think she puts anything
in your scrambled eggs.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.225
Where's the boy?

07:16.310 --> 07:18.438
He hasn't been in to see me for days.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.230
He's...

07:22.900 --> 07:23.900
with friends...

07:25.027 --> 07:26.027
for a few days.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.490
Off drinking
and causing trouble.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.158
Good for him.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.954
Boys need to blow off steam.

07:35.746 --> 07:40.418
You're too hard on the kid.
Boys need their wild time.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.795
Yes, Dad.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.841
It's how they grow up to be men.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.261
Yes.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.640
I remember being young in this house,

07:55.391 --> 07:57.518
raising holy hell.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.938
Give him room, for Christ's sakes.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.609
Let him make his fucking mistakes,
he's a boy.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.235
Yes, Dad.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.072
The new painkillers are for shit,
by the way.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.908
That doctor doesn't have a clue.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.578
Goddamn witch doctors,
all of ‘em, there’s no science...

08:17.705 --> 08:20.833
<i>You found steroids
in the Range Rover in quantity.</i>

08:22.210 --> 08:24.545
<i>You thought: "Drug deal gone bad."</i>

08:25.588 --> 08:26.588
<i>Makes sense.</i>

08:26.631 --> 08:28.299
You know, you can't just do this.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.902
What about our First Amendment rights?

08:31.177 --> 08:34.847
Yeah, that would be the Fourth Amendment,
Mr. de la Cruz. And the Supreme Court

08:34.931 --> 08:39.143
has established our school's right
to function <i>in loco parentis.</i>

08:40.436 --> 08:42.938
Dempsey, what the hell?
You got nothing to say about this?

08:43.022 --> 08:45.816
We talked about it in pre-season.
Liberty Tigers play clean.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.276
I say go ahead and search.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.572
This yours, Justin?

08:53.241 --> 08:54.241
Uh, yes, sir.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.499
Sheriff?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.418
Yeah?

09:08.506 --> 09:09.507
Take a look.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.053
<i>Quite a few of the guys
at Liberty were using, it turns out.</i>

09:15.346 --> 09:18.641
<i>And you can draw a line
from every one of them to Bryce Walker.</i>

09:22.979 --> 09:24.480
Holliday?

09:24.564 --> 09:25.564
Yes, sir?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.443
Come with me, son.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.907
<i>One of those lines is brighter
than the others.</i>

09:35.825 --> 09:36.951
<i>And I'll tell you why.</i>

09:39.453 --> 09:40.663
Hey, Dad. What's up?

09:42.081 --> 09:44.875
Just doing some business, buddy.
Nothing to worry about.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.504
Fuck.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.923
Hey. Do you guys know what's going on?

09:51.132 --> 09:53.342
They searched
the football lockers this morning,

09:53.426 --> 09:55.052
- Caught Luke with juice.
- Luke?

09:55.803 --> 09:58.003
You want to tell me
where you got the steroids?

10:00.516 --> 10:01.851
How long you been juicing?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.770
Do you know
if anyone else on the team is on steroids?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.856
No, sir. No.
I didn't even know about Luke.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.065
Do you know of anyone else

10:08.149 --> 10:11.068
who might have been
still talking to Bryce Walker?

10:12.820 --> 10:13.821
No, sir.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.174
You're gonna protest his funeral?
I mean, Jess, come on.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.408
This is so fucked up.

10:17.491 --> 10:18.784
This wasn't me!

10:19.994 --> 10:23.331
You guys, heads up if you have shit
in your lockers. They're doing a search.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.094
Yeah, they already did, the football team.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.644
No, my dad's still here.
They'll do the whole school, I promise.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.338
- Well, I've got nothing to hide.
- Well, good for you.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.009
Why does he give a shit
about a locker search?

10:35.092 --> 10:36.344
So, you and Bryce,

10:36.969 --> 10:38.054
you weren't in touch?

10:39.889 --> 10:42.475
Homecoming was the first time I saw him
since he left Liberty.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.185
So, you didn't know he was dealing?

10:44.518 --> 10:46.538
- I didn't.
- You bought from Bryce Walker?

10:46.562 --> 10:48.397
- No, sir.
- You didn't?

10:49.065 --> 10:50.065
Then who?

10:52.026 --> 10:53.861
Son, this is a murder investigation.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.905
If you didn't buy
from the kid who was killed,

10:55.988 --> 10:57.907
I need to know who you got them from.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.204
Tim Pozzi.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.916
He works out at City Gym.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.918
In the warehouse district.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.836
<i>It's not just athletes.</i>

11:10.920 --> 11:14.632
Okay? I've known kids, all kinds of kids,
that juice. It's...

11:15.216 --> 11:16.216
a body thing.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.302
What kids? Who?

11:19.345 --> 11:20.345
I mean...

11:22.098 --> 11:24.141
I can't think of any names...

11:24.725 --> 11:25.893
off the top of my head.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.675
I don't believe it. Not Alex.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.599
"Testosterone cypionate."

12:05.683 --> 12:06.684
Steroids.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.518
Bryce was dealing them.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.897
Why would Bryce deal?
He didn't need the money.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.399
Maybe it was about control.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.693
Anyone who bought from him,

12:15.776 --> 12:16.944
he had a hand on them.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.321
But Alex, he's a mellow guy.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.990
Alex is mellow?

12:28.622 --> 12:31.083
- They're searching lockers today.
- Good.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.877
Find a lot of those.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.045
Wait, they told me
that you wanted to do this.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.798
We don't need her permission.
The group decided.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.884
The group did not decide, you decided.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.886
You just want to piss people off.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.513
Yes, I fucking do.
People should be pissed off!

12:44.597 --> 12:47.117
This doesn't end 'cause
they put a fucking rapist in the ground.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.310
My rapist! My rapist, okay?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.687
And I say we can't do this.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.023
We can't be this!

12:54.106 --> 12:55.666
'Cause you want to protect your rapist,

12:55.733 --> 12:58.569
- and that's messed up.
- No, because there's human decency!

13:01.238 --> 13:02.698
I think I understand.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.327
You're still a victim.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.665
Well, you'll know where to find
the survivors on Sunday.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.589
<i>This is fucked up.</i>

13:19.340 --> 13:21.175
This is like an invasion of privacy.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.968
He got it out of a garbage can.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.053
Fuck Justin!

13:24.136 --> 13:27.181
He's gonna rat people out about drugs?
Really?

13:27.807 --> 13:28.807
Are you...

13:29.642 --> 13:30.642
Are you okay?

13:30.684 --> 13:31.684
Are you?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.813
Are you okay? Ani, are you?

13:34.688 --> 13:35.689
Fuck you guys!

13:42.112 --> 13:43.112
Alex...

13:43.322 --> 13:45.908
Just... just don't tell my dad, okay?

13:46.742 --> 13:47.910
Is it about Bryce?

13:47.993 --> 13:48.993
No.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.997
I didn't buy from Bryce.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.625
Luke hooked me up with a guy.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.294
But why?

13:57.378 --> 13:58.546
Why do you think?

13:59.463 --> 14:00.756
Just look at me.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.635
I think you're very handsome.
I think you're adorable.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.263
Yeah. Well, you're the one girl
in this county

14:07.346 --> 14:09.181
that would go for a skinny, sad kid.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.808
And you went for Clay, so...

14:11.684 --> 14:13.644
I'm gonna let that go
because you're under stress.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.605
Wouldn't you have done anything
to have Hannah love you back?

14:17.439 --> 14:20.860
To choose you over Zach,
or stupid Justin?

14:22.069 --> 14:26.073
Even before I shot myself,
it's like the pieces never worked.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.659
And they're never going to.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.586
<i>The quiet boy.</i>

14:39.920 --> 14:40.921
<i>The gentle one.</i>

14:43.215 --> 14:45.092
<i>There's more going on than you know.</i>

14:45.801 --> 14:48.053
<i>But I don't have to tell you that, do I?</i>

14:55.644 --> 14:56.687
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.193
I finished.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.405
This is the last drink on the menu
including the seasonal specials.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.157
Wow, that's...

15:09.033 --> 15:10.367
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.453
Yes, it's been quite the odyssey.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.536
Yeah.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.749
You want to sit?

15:17.124 --> 15:20.544
I mean, we can be the kind of friends
that drink coffee, right?

15:21.128 --> 15:23.047
- I think we can be that.
- Yeah.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.300
Our friendship survived
you dumping me for Justin before, so...

15:27.801 --> 15:28.886
That was a joke.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.430
I'm sorry.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.265
Let's talk about anything else.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.144
Can I just ask you one question?

15:38.354 --> 15:40.814
What is it about me
that isn't good enough?

15:41.690 --> 15:43.484
Alex, come on. It's not...

15:44.318 --> 15:45.486
It's not about that.

15:45.569 --> 15:48.030
Then what? 'Cause I don't understand

15:48.113 --> 15:51.200
why you weren't ready to date me
but you're ready to date him.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.036
Why you want to be with one person
and not someone else,

15:54.119 --> 15:55.287
you can't always explain it.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.121
Well, try.

16:00.918 --> 16:01.919
It's like...

16:02.503 --> 16:04.463
you learn to listen to your body.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.174
Who you're attracted to.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.469
Who makes you feel safe.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.971
Safe?

16:12.930 --> 16:14.390
He let his best friend rape you!

16:14.473 --> 16:17.309
And then he lied to you about it!
How the fuck does that feel safe?

16:20.813 --> 16:21.897
You should probably go.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.024
Right, yeah.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.860
- Shit!
- Jess!

16:27.152 --> 16:30.823
- I'm so sorry! I'll get napkins.
- God!

16:33.534 --> 16:35.786
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

16:44.461 --> 16:45.713
<i>Sooner or later,</i>

16:46.338 --> 16:48.173
<i>what's hidden comes out.</i>

16:55.556 --> 16:56.557
<i>Sooner or later,</i>

16:57.016 --> 16:58.100
<i>enough is enough.</i>

17:07.943 --> 17:11.946
So for now, just gonna have to do the bar,
make sure you have proper form.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.994
And then, after a couple of sessions,
maybe we'll add a little bit more weight.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.663
I can do more weight than this.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.248
Well...

17:23.500 --> 17:25.252
let's just see how this goes first.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.546
Oh, don't start yet. Forgot something.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.344
Hey, if you want some shit
to get you started, let me know.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.891
- Okay.
- Dude, no shame. Everyone needs help.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.393
Come see me later, and don't tell Dempsey.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.646
All right, here we go.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.344
Don't want you to hurt your back.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.110
- Yeah, awesome. Thanks.
- Yeah.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.033
<i>♪ They got sick of the boys club ♪</i>

17:56.533 --> 17:58.869
<i>♪ They got sick of those men ♪</i>

17:59.578 --> 18:04.374
<i>♪ Tellin' them what they couldn't do
'Cause they were too shy or too femme ♪</i>

18:05.751 --> 18:07.920
<i>♪ Until they thought of their own space ♪</i>

18:08.754 --> 18:10.756
<i>♪ Where they could plug in that tight ♪</i>

18:12.049 --> 18:14.259
They clean out the gym lockers
at the end of summer,

18:14.343 --> 18:16.261
so keep these in your main locker.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.973
- In summer, I don't have a locker.
- Use the one from last year.

18:20.057 --> 18:23.685
They lost the master key,
so no searching, no new combos.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.604
All right, got it. Thanks.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.361
<i>The steroids led us to Alex...</i>

18:34.446 --> 18:35.989
<i>but he didn't buy from Bryce.</i>

18:37.199 --> 18:38.826
- Hey, Alex. What's up?
- Hey!

18:39.535 --> 18:42.579
Just working out and then
I just wandered over here. How about you?

18:42.663 --> 18:45.749
Math! I mean, math! Come on, let's go.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.418
- No one uses it!
- Picking him up from Summer School.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.338
I feel you, man.
My brother's an asshole, too.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.422
Yeah. See you, man.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.008
<i>Who else showed signs
of steroid use?</i>

18:56.635 --> 18:58.887
<i>Violent mood swings. Aggression.</i>

19:02.182 --> 19:03.517
<i>Montgomery de la Cruz.</i>

19:12.943 --> 19:16.196
The police took Luke,
but he didn't buy from Bryce.

19:16.947 --> 19:17.990
And Monty did.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.543
He's clearing out.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.008
<i>I hate to admit
Alex and Monty had anything in common...</i>

19:37.426 --> 19:39.386
<i>and Alex would hate me for saying so...</i>

19:40.846 --> 19:43.974
<i>but it turns out they had way more
in common than we thought.</i>

20:13.921 --> 20:17.132
Wait. What do you think
Monty doesn't want Winston talking about?

20:22.763 --> 20:23.889
This was on the seat.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.517
Is that... blood?

20:29.311 --> 20:32.773
<i>This is a lockdown.
Return to your classrooms immediately.</i>

20:32.856 --> 20:35.943
<i>But Alex and Monty were hiding
some of the same things.</i>

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
<i>Some of them were things
all boys hide.</i>

20:40.572 --> 20:43.283
You want to tell me
why you were out of class just now?

20:44.576 --> 20:46.370
Just late driving back from lunch.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.581
They let you drive off campus for lunch?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.086
You ever ride with Bryce Walker?

20:56.505 --> 20:58.465
Uh, to lunch? No.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.050
Or more recently?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.097
<i>Their secrets.</i>

21:09.309 --> 21:10.352
<i>Their fears.</i>

21:15.983 --> 21:17.901
<i>Their deep, shameful desires.</i>

21:26.410 --> 21:29.079
<i>Their rage
at the unfairness of everything.</i>

21:35.877 --> 21:36.878
Pick all that up.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.895
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Locker's clean.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.897
<i>Their rage at the world...</i>

21:56.940 --> 21:59.443
And you think
given the circumstances of his death

21:59.526 --> 22:03.989
that this kind of protest is appropriate?

22:05.240 --> 22:06.867
Well, he was a rapist.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.444
He was also a child
whose family is mourning his death.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.414
And we're reminding them what he did
when he was alive.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.415
Miss Davis,

22:13.498 --> 22:16.460
we've supported your group,
we've given you all access

22:16.543 --> 22:18.879
to meeting rooms, school resources,

22:18.962 --> 22:20.213
but this... This is...

22:20.922 --> 22:22.716
This does not feel like activism.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.343
This is a vendetta.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.094
This is personal.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.389
Well, the group decided, not me.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.060
But it's all personal, Mr. Bolan.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.729
- The personal is political.
- I don't suppose

22:35.812 --> 22:38.190
you'd believe me
if I were to tell you that...

22:39.524 --> 22:40.524
I'm a feminist.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.986
No. Not really.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.281
Well, I am. And I value activism.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.784
I was arrested for protesting apartheid.

22:48.867 --> 22:52.454
I've walked these picket lines three times
as a teacher.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.499
So, I'd like you to ask yourself

22:56.249 --> 22:58.502
if your ends justify these means.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.129
- We believe in our cause.
- So do I.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.547
Until you do this.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.303
It's a troubled time, Miss Davis.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.139
Think hard...

23:12.015 --> 23:13.350
before you make it worse.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.273
<i>But Monty never bothered
hiding his rage.</i>

23:21.650 --> 23:24.069
<i>He was just desperate to hide
where it came from.</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:27.447
Can I ask you something?

23:29.116 --> 23:30.367
Why do you care so much?

23:31.118 --> 23:32.160
About finding out?

23:33.161 --> 23:34.161
Clay...

23:35.747 --> 23:39.501
I heard Mrs. Walker this morning
telling the cops to look at you again.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.585
So it's about me?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.420
It's not...

23:43.630 --> 23:44.630
It's not about Bryce?

23:45.966 --> 23:47.175
How you felt about him?

23:50.011 --> 23:51.012
Can it be both?

23:58.603 --> 24:00.772
<i>We followed him home and waited.</i>

24:01.440 --> 24:05.152
There were things he was hiding...
that he couldn't show anyone.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.370
Oh, shit! Sorry.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.081
Oh, it's all right. Really.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.460
Oh, my God. What time is it?

24:23.336 --> 24:24.629
We gotta get you home!

24:25.005 --> 24:27.090
Get your ass over here!
Get your ass over here!

24:27.424 --> 24:28.592
Fucking little criminal!

24:29.217 --> 24:30.218
Where are you?

24:31.052 --> 24:33.555
I'll split your head open,
you little shit!

24:33.638 --> 24:35.223
God damn it!

24:35.640 --> 24:37.309
- What the hell?
- Hey!

24:39.060 --> 24:40.061
Hey, I see you.

24:40.729 --> 24:41.730
Don't move!

24:59.456 --> 25:01.833
Not so tough now,
you fucking piece of shit!

25:12.552 --> 25:14.112
- Do we call the police?
- I don't know.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.056
- Just get in the car.
- You get in the car!

25:16.181 --> 25:18.541
I'm not getting in the car
if you're not getting in the car.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.217
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- We...

25:23.980 --> 25:24.980
Nothing.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.860
Is that blood?

25:32.197 --> 25:33.198
What's it to you?

25:34.991 --> 25:35.992
Is it Bryce's?

25:37.869 --> 25:38.869
What?

25:40.872 --> 25:41.998
No, it's mine.

25:42.832 --> 25:43.833
And his.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.210
You want a taste?

25:45.835 --> 25:46.836
No, thanks.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.548
He was my best friend, asshole.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.093
Leave me the fuck alone!

26:00.392 --> 26:02.394
- I really need to get home.
- Yeah.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.656
Justin?

26:17.617 --> 26:19.619
- You got it?
- Straight swap?

26:20.495 --> 26:22.330
Works for me. Bargain.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.622
One condition.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.002
You never sell to a kid again,
you got me?

26:27.586 --> 26:28.586
Whatever, dude.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.511
Yeah, sure. Fine.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.526
<i>Tell your mom
you have Biology Club tomorrow.</i>

26:52.902 --> 26:54.863
So, tell her you have Chemistry Club.

26:56.906 --> 27:00.118
Wait, so she'll believe Biology Club
and not Chemistry Club?

27:00.493 --> 27:01.828
How does that even make...

27:04.456 --> 27:05.707
I found his Facebook.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.878
Winston Williams...

27:10.837 --> 27:12.213
still at Hillcrest.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.677
Now he's white.

27:21.848 --> 27:22.849
What the hell?

27:24.142 --> 27:25.143
Brian Chu.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.396
He took the SAT for me.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.024
How did Montgomery get it?

27:32.525 --> 27:34.110
Bryce Walker got it from Brian.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.364
- Why did Bryce want it?
- Leverage.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.615
So I wouldn't talk.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.032
About what?

27:43.495 --> 27:44.871
Dude, Bryce is dead.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.665
It's not about that.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.501
I made the deal with Bryce
to keep quiet,

27:49.584 --> 27:51.419
but really it was for Monty.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.839
You know Bryce from Hillcrest?

27:55.715 --> 27:56.716
How do you know Monty?

28:00.387 --> 28:01.471
We met at a party.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.397
Man, I hate rich kid parties.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.358
Monty, every party I've ever had
was a rich kid party.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.236
- I don't even know anybody here.
- So, you'll meet people.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.999
If it sucks, we'll leave.
I don't care. Just glad to be hanging out.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.907
Yeah, man, me too. For real.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.201
You're the only decent human left
at Liberty.

28:23.284 --> 28:24.285
Got that right.

28:24.452 --> 28:29.374
All right, it is time to get fucked up.
Bet this house has top-shelf whiskey.

28:39.342 --> 28:40.510
Who's the Latinx?

28:44.097 --> 28:45.097
I dunno.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.323
Where's the fucking bathroom?

29:09.831 --> 29:11.166
Not the bathroom, friend.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.084
And don't piss on the bed.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.587
Rumor has it Purcell isn't much into that.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.629
Easy.

30:38.127 --> 30:41.339
<i>♪ Kick my shoes off and run ♪</i>

30:45.301 --> 30:46.301
You look lost.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.638
Yeah, I'm looking for Bryce Walker.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.098
Standall!

30:52.183 --> 30:54.894
- Hey! You found the place!
- Yep.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.981
- What's up, buddy?
- Nothing.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.358
Hey, come on in.
Take a seat. Grab a drink.

31:00.441 --> 31:03.152
I'm not here to party.
You said that you had the stuff.

31:03.236 --> 31:06.614
The juice? Yeah, and for half the price
that towny gym rat charges.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.367
- Dude!
- Relax, man. No one here gives a fuck.

31:09.450 --> 31:12.370
- There's a dude selling coke out back.
- Okay. Can we just...

31:12.453 --> 31:13.705
Yeah, stuff's in the car.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.706
Okay..

31:19.711 --> 31:21.045
- What is it, 100?
- Yep.

31:24.382 --> 31:27.051
Bryce, what the fuck, man?
Where have you been?

31:27.510 --> 31:31.723
Let's get the fuck out of here.
It's all rich fuckheads. No offense.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.933
Hey, it was nice meeting you.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.139
We should hang out sometime.

31:40.648 --> 31:41.900
What'd you say to me, faggot?

31:43.234 --> 31:44.402
Dude, chill, all right?

31:45.945 --> 31:47.030
What the fuck?

31:47.405 --> 31:48.865
- Whoa!
- Jesus!

31:48.948 --> 31:50.617
Monty! Hey!

31:50.700 --> 31:52.285
Get off of him, man!

31:52.368 --> 31:53.368
Jesus!

32:10.053 --> 32:11.213
Why'd he go after you?

32:13.181 --> 32:14.182
No clue.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.100
Never seen him before.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.186
No one called the cops.

32:18.436 --> 32:21.689
No one has to. Here's 2,000.
I can get you three more tomorrow.

32:25.485 --> 32:30.239
Look, man, I'm sorry. He's... fucked up.
He gets, like, beat at home and shit.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.409
Five thousand more tomorrow.

32:35.995 --> 32:36.995
All right.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.527
Pleasure doing business with you.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.320
Hey, you sure that you're okay to drive?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.766
Oh, Alex, I'm touched you care!

32:58.226 --> 32:59.352
Yeah, I'm all good.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.483
He's gonna fucking talk.
He'll just take the money and talk.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.151
I'll take care of it, Monty.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.362
Don't I always?

33:11.739 --> 33:14.701
Pleasure doing business with you, too.
See you in a couple of weeks.

33:14.784 --> 33:15.784
Yeah.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.495
Yeah, you will.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.721
Your friends are messed up.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.473
Yeah, they're super messed up.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.268
Also, they're not my friends.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.091
<i>Are you sure it was Alex?</i>

33:44.188 --> 33:45.188
Yeah.

33:45.648 --> 33:48.860
But Bryce and Alex didn't know
what happened with you and Monty?

33:49.277 --> 33:51.529
And Bryce got the ID to keep you quiet?

33:51.612 --> 33:52.947
Bryce brought me the cash.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.501
He said he got the ID from Brian
and we didn't talk about it anymore.

33:56.909 --> 33:58.494
I'm fourth-generation Princeton.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.788
Unless that gets out.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.374
You kept Monty's secret,

34:04.042 --> 34:05.918
even though he beat the shit out of you?

34:06.002 --> 34:07.378
That's a secret you keep.

34:08.755 --> 34:09.755
So...

34:10.840 --> 34:11.840
use it well, okay?

34:25.480 --> 34:26.813
Monty's a sick boy,

34:27.732 --> 34:31.027
and violent as shit,
but he hasn't got a motive.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.321
How could Bryce not find out?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.281
I don't think he knew.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.036
- Because then you would've known.
- Clay!

34:40.745 --> 34:41.745
Forget it.

34:42.871 --> 34:44.373
Alex lied to us.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.208
About buying from Bryce.

34:48.293 --> 34:49.293
Yeah.

34:51.714 --> 34:52.799
<i>As for Alex,</i>

34:54.217 --> 34:56.135
<i>there's not much more to say, really.</i>

35:01.057 --> 35:02.600
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

35:03.559 --> 35:04.560
You work out here?

35:06.354 --> 35:07.647
Uh, I was...

35:09.440 --> 35:11.150
I don't know, self-improvement, you know?

35:11.234 --> 35:14.070
I don't recommend illegal supplements,
for what it's worth.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.362
No.

35:16.823 --> 35:17.823
But,

35:18.116 --> 35:21.035
will you show me, like,
how to do all this shit?

35:21.661 --> 35:23.371
Justin is always like, "Squats are key,"

35:23.454 --> 35:25.294
and all I can think about
is him taking a crap.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.334
It's actually somewhat like that.

35:28.668 --> 35:32.171
Uh, here, you should probably start
with just the bar.

35:32.255 --> 35:36.008
It's my two favorite sad,
skinny guys.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.176
It's too soon to joke.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.053
I love you, and you know it.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.949
- And you two working out together...
- Please don't say we're cute.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.599
...are so fucking hot!

35:43.683 --> 35:45.935
I can't even stand it. I'm overwhelmed.

35:46.018 --> 35:47.353
Feet shoulder-width apart.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.814
Yeah, and then, okay.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.816
- Core tight.
- Sorry, core?

35:52.275 --> 35:54.443
Like your abs.
So, core tight and then, yeah,

35:54.527 --> 35:57.280
- the bar wants to rest across your delts.
- Okay.

35:57.947 --> 36:01.117
- And then you just lift.
- Like that?

36:01.200 --> 36:03.040
- Yeah, and then now you just...
- Cool.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.495
...squat. Yeah.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.167
We certainly had no reason
to continue to suspect him.

36:15.631 --> 36:16.632
Password.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.093
Try "Jessica."

36:19.760 --> 36:23.055
That's seven. How about her birthday?

36:24.182 --> 36:25.766
- Well, I don't know her...
- I do.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.229
Yeah, that's it.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.231
Yeah.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.692
He was lying to us.

36:35.401 --> 36:36.402
Every few weeks,

36:36.485 --> 36:38.487
$100 to Bryce.

36:39.906 --> 36:40.907
Wait, hold on.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.868
Later in the summer
the payments doubled.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.997
He sends $300
to somebody named Melody Scott?

36:49.332 --> 36:52.585
And it goes to $200 to Bryce,
but still every two weeks.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.629
Who's Melody Scott?

36:58.549 --> 37:00.718
We will find out.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.472
Here. Get this back in the bag.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.520
A prostitute?

37:11.687 --> 37:13.606
I'm, like, 90% certain.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.777
- We have prostitutes in Evergreen?
- Shocked. Shocked!

37:17.902 --> 37:19.779
I think they perhaps prefer "escort."

37:19.862 --> 37:22.462
That's just ridiculous,
'cause no one's getting escorted anywhere,

37:22.531 --> 37:23.741
but how do you even know...

37:23.824 --> 37:26.544
Well, she said that she only worked out
from her home. No "outcalls."

37:26.577 --> 37:28.746
So, she's an escort or a masseuse.

37:28.829 --> 37:31.999
Or perhaps an aesthetician.
Or a medium of some sort.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.918
But when I asked for an appointment,

37:34.001 --> 37:36.337
she had me confirm
that I wasn't in law enforcement.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.713
So it's all sort of clicked.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.008
Okay, but we're not going there.
We know enough, right?

37:41.092 --> 37:43.012
Alex went to a prostitute.
Bryce blackmailed him.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.595
But does that sound like Bryce to you?

37:44.679 --> 37:47.807
It seems like Bryce would celebrate him
for scoring with a pro.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.726
That's the most anti-Bryce thing
you've said in days.

37:50.810 --> 37:54.814
Oh, good God, it wasn't anti-Bryce.
If anything, it was anti-men.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.775
But, I mean,
she's not going to tell us anything.

37:57.858 --> 38:00.111
There's, like,
patient-client confidentiality.

38:00.194 --> 38:03.114
Well, you'll just have to play along then,
until she talks.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.031
Wait, what?

38:05.658 --> 38:06.658
We're not gonna...

38:07.535 --> 38:08.703
Wait, what?

38:17.378 --> 38:20.548
We'll pay you
for your time.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.132
Okay.

38:22.591 --> 38:23.591
And...

38:23.926 --> 38:24.969
what will we be...

38:25.761 --> 38:26.971
doing with that time?

38:32.018 --> 38:33.769
Our friend recommended you.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.605
- Who's your friend?
- Alex.

38:36.689 --> 38:39.608
His name's Alex.
I think you saw him last summer?

38:39.692 --> 38:41.610
Sure. I remember Alex.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.990
And why did he... refer you to me?

38:47.700 --> 38:48.700
Well, um...

38:50.244 --> 38:54.165
to be honest, he didn't refer us exactly.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.875
He mentioned you.

38:56.709 --> 39:00.254
And we're worried about him,
he's not in a great place.

39:00.921 --> 39:02.131
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.678
We lost a friend of ours a few days ago.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.430
His name was Bryce Walker.

39:10.056 --> 39:14.060
We think he might've known
about Alex coming to see you.

39:14.643 --> 39:15.936
He did.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.273
I knew Bryce well.
He brought Alex here the first time.

39:26.614 --> 39:30.493
Luke didn't want to get caught selling,
so he sent me directly to his dealer

39:30.576 --> 39:33.638
who'd seen me around with my dad and
said no way he was dealing to a cop's kid.

39:33.662 --> 39:37.291
So, I went to Bryce, 'cause I knew
that's where Monty got his shit.

39:37.666 --> 39:41.379
How did you get from buying from him
to going to a hooker together?

39:41.462 --> 39:44.048
It was stupid. It was just one time.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.051
She said you went back
a second time alone.

39:50.429 --> 39:53.182
And after that,
Bryce was... blackmailing you?

39:53.265 --> 39:54.265
No.

39:57.728 --> 40:01.690
<i>So, yeah,
Alex did buy steroids from Bryce one time.</i>

40:02.316 --> 40:03.317
<i>That was it.</i>

40:04.235 --> 40:06.362
<i>I don't think they saw each other
after that.</i>

40:09.240 --> 40:11.534
Relax, man. The nurse has the night off.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.035
Mom's out.

40:13.786 --> 40:14.995
Grandpa's senile.

40:16.622 --> 40:17.748
It's just you and me.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.423
Does it hurt?

40:26.590 --> 40:27.591
Find out.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.180
You gotta commit, though.
Do the whole line.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.901
Okay. Holy shit!

40:47.403 --> 40:49.447
That fucking hurts.

40:49.655 --> 40:50.906
Give it a few minutes.

40:51.615 --> 40:52.783
Oh...

40:53.075 --> 40:54.995
We got to get you laid, man.
That's the key here.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.913
- I'm good.
- No, you're not.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.124
No, I'm not.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.751
It's not like
there's anything I can do about it.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.420
Ah, but there is.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.424
This is a terrible idea.

41:09.133 --> 41:12.344
Dude, it's her job
to make you feel better about yourself.

41:13.053 --> 41:14.513
When was the last time you got laid?

41:14.805 --> 41:15.805
Like, months ago.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.766
Porn and j.o. since, right?

41:17.850 --> 41:19.602
Multiple times a day some days.

41:19.685 --> 41:20.685
Yeah.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.314
Um...

41:25.065 --> 41:26.942
After the... the trial,

41:27.776 --> 41:28.777
last spring,

41:28.861 --> 41:30.029
Chloe didn't want to...

41:31.238 --> 41:34.950
Well, I mean, she'd...
she'd barely even touch me.

41:35.618 --> 41:36.952
And now, I mean...

41:37.661 --> 41:38.704
no one will...

41:39.163 --> 41:40.164
touch me.

41:41.123 --> 41:45.878
Unless some asshole at Hillcrest decides
to sucker punch me in the hallway,

41:46.420 --> 41:47.922
but that's the...

41:48.631 --> 41:50.549
entirety of my human contact

41:51.050 --> 41:52.050
nowadays.

41:53.052 --> 41:57.014
Except for Melody, who provides a service
that you and I need.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.019
Alex.

42:11.820 --> 42:12.821
Go get 'em!

42:20.663 --> 42:23.499
Sweetie, slow down. You're not in a movie.

42:25.501 --> 42:26.502
Can we kiss?

42:26.961 --> 42:27.961
Okay.

42:39.098 --> 42:40.099
Shit. Sorry.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.725
No, you're good. You're good.

42:47.022 --> 42:48.399
- Sorry.
- All good.

42:49.191 --> 42:51.360
Talk to me. Talk dirty.

42:51.443 --> 42:52.278
No.

42:52.361 --> 42:53.445
Come on, stud.

42:54.446 --> 42:56.282
Talk to me. Tell me what's up.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.867
- I think I'm gonna come.
- That's it.

42:59.451 --> 43:00.536
Show me you're a man.

43:00.619 --> 43:02.746
Bitch! Fucking bitch!

43:25.561 --> 43:26.761
So, wait. Where are we?

43:27.730 --> 43:28.856
Finish your story.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.691
No, I just, I mean literally,

43:30.774 --> 43:33.861
the next night after we went
to fucking what's-her-name...

43:33.944 --> 43:35.613
The next night, I met her.

43:35.696 --> 43:39.033
She goes to East County, and we've been,
like, doing it every night this week.

43:39.116 --> 43:42.911
Dude, hell yeah! I'm honored you fit me
in to your busy schedule.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.958
She has to spend some time
with her boyfriend.

43:49.168 --> 43:51.253
Dude, what are we even doing here?

43:54.840 --> 43:56.300
It's my father's new place.

43:57.259 --> 44:00.763
He's in Telluride with his lady.
We're gonna go in and fuck the place up.

44:01.430 --> 44:04.099
- Dude, that's breaking and entering.
- No, he's my dad.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.144
Technically,
I'm just messing up my own place.

44:20.074 --> 44:21.074
Fuck.

44:28.248 --> 44:29.375
Oh, fuck, yes.

44:31.543 --> 44:32.544
That'll do it.

44:39.635 --> 44:40.719
Oh, hell yeah!

44:45.057 --> 44:46.308
Good call!

Oh, fuck it, man!
I can't believe we just did that.

46:14.772 --> 46:15.773
Oh...

46:21.779 --> 46:23.489
You're a horrible person.

46:24.823 --> 46:25.991
Yeah, pretty much.

46:26.742 --> 46:28.827
That kid is scarred for life
because of us.

46:28.911 --> 46:32.790
Alex. Baby, we're all scarred for life.
Check your fucking head.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.876
- I don't ever want to see you again.
- What?

46:36.126 --> 46:37.669
Alex, come on.

46:38.462 --> 46:39.463
Come back.

46:40.297 --> 46:41.297
Alex!

46:44.718 --> 46:46.762
Where are you gonna get your shit from,
sweetheart?

46:46.887 --> 46:48.806
Only friends and family get the discount.

46:50.682 --> 46:51.682
Alex!

46:57.773 --> 46:59.358
It's good to see you again.

47:00.734 --> 47:02.402
What's your pleasure today, honey?

47:08.033 --> 47:09.033
Sweetie...

47:14.706 --> 47:15.707
Come here.

47:17.501 --> 47:19.419
Come here. It's okay.

47:24.174 --> 47:25.217
It's gonna be okay.

47:26.051 --> 47:28.679
<i>I don't think
I'll ever forget that little kid's face.</i>

47:29.972 --> 47:31.515
I'm sure he won't forget mine.

47:33.433 --> 47:36.854
After that, I didn't get the discount,
which is why the payments went up.

47:37.396 --> 47:41.066
He never blackmailed me.
He never said a thing about anything.

47:41.149 --> 47:42.234
Wait, so are you...

47:43.110 --> 47:44.987
Are you using now, or are you clean?

47:45.863 --> 47:46.905
Nobody's clean.

47:48.407 --> 47:51.493
- Alex, you don't have to go.
- Yeah. Well, I'm not going to stay.

47:52.327 --> 47:53.495
I don't want you to...

47:56.582 --> 47:57.942
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.961
Yeah, I've run out of ways to do that.

48:18.604 --> 48:20.355
Do you think I'm a sad, skinny kid?

48:24.026 --> 48:25.068
Ah...

48:25.652 --> 48:28.488
I think you are a lean...

48:29.823 --> 48:32.284
but right-sized...

48:33.452 --> 48:34.661
very handsome,

48:35.454 --> 48:36.788
very complicated kid.

48:42.711 --> 48:43.712
I'll take it.

48:54.139 --> 48:55.807
How's... how's Alex?

48:58.352 --> 48:59.353
Messed up.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.272
But aren't we all?

49:04.066 --> 49:07.778
You know, I really didn't think
he had anything to do with Bryce, but...

49:10.572 --> 49:13.241
drugs of any kind, man, they fuck you up.

49:14.034 --> 49:15.034
Yeah.

49:18.747 --> 49:22.084
I'll have you know,
the gun is gone for good.

49:25.212 --> 49:26.713
Awesome. Thanks.

49:30.884 --> 49:32.511
You seem awfully dark tonight.

49:35.347 --> 49:36.431
How are you not?

49:39.851 --> 49:40.852
I guess I am.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.316
But I'm alive,
so I figure I'm ahead of the game.

49:49.277 --> 49:50.277
Right.

49:52.739 --> 49:55.534
I don't want to believe
someone we know killed Bryce.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.663
But it seems like
everyone we know had a reason.

50:00.747 --> 50:02.165
Everyone's got their shit.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.004
Yes.

50:54.718 --> 50:56.970
You ever tried it before?
I've got some more.

50:58.221 --> 50:59.264
No, thank you.

51:00.807 --> 51:04.478
I offered to help the maids
prepare the study.

51:05.228 --> 51:06.229
Your grandfa...

51:06.313 --> 51:09.733
I'm sure you've had it before.
You're a city girl. You're all fancy.

51:10.609 --> 51:14.196
Your grandfather plans
to receive some old friends tomorrow.

51:14.279 --> 51:16.823
Well, let's hope they don't notice
the missing bourbon.

51:19.284 --> 51:20.284
Cheers.

51:22.537 --> 51:25.332
You look tired.
Perhaps you should get some sleep.

51:25.415 --> 51:27.751
He's a piece of work, my grandfather,
isn't he?

51:28.960 --> 51:29.960
He's...

51:31.379 --> 51:33.381
an interesting man.

51:35.133 --> 51:36.133
He's a...

51:37.010 --> 51:40.388
racist, homophobic, angry piece of shit.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.604
My dad bought a new house.

51:49.397 --> 51:51.983
Same fucking neighborhood as the old one.

51:53.527 --> 51:56.446
Not the big colonial on Summit,
it turns out, but...

51:57.322 --> 51:58.907
somewhere in that neighborhood.

51:59.241 --> 52:01.535
Asshole abandoned his family,

52:01.618 --> 52:04.162
didn't even have the decency
to move to another fucking town.

52:04.246 --> 52:07.415
Maybe he wants to continue
to be a part of your life.

52:09.918 --> 52:10.918
No.

52:18.051 --> 52:19.177
I look at him

52:19.261 --> 52:23.181
and I look at my grandfather,
and I think, "Where the hell do I end up?"

52:23.974 --> 52:26.226
Wherever you want, I think.

52:27.352 --> 52:28.352
Do you?

52:29.938 --> 52:31.815
Did you end up where you want to be?

52:32.399 --> 52:34.818
Cleaning up coke for a rich white kid.

52:35.527 --> 52:39.573
I'm helping my mother, so,
I'm exactly where I want to be.

52:40.073 --> 52:42.284
Well, fucking good for you.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.872
Fucking good for you!

52:49.124 --> 52:51.960
- Bryce! That's quite enough.
- Hey, Mom.

52:53.378 --> 52:55.088
Go to your room. Now!

52:56.631 --> 52:57.799
Guess I'm in trouble.

52:59.217 --> 53:00.218
Good night, Ani.

53:00.969 --> 53:02.512
I'm sorry about the mess.

53:04.681 --> 53:08.059
You are never to speak to her again.
You are not to go near her.

53:08.143 --> 53:10.645
Or you will have no home here,
do you understand me?

53:10.729 --> 53:13.481
- Understand?
- Yes. Yeah, I understand.

53:20.530 --> 53:23.533
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Walker.

53:24.034 --> 53:26.912
Don't be. You did nothing wrong.

53:26.995 --> 53:29.998
He was tired and upset about his father.

53:30.081 --> 53:33.084
Yes, there are all manner of excuses.

53:34.586 --> 53:35.587
But my son...

53:41.843 --> 53:43.303
You should be very careful.

53:53.355 --> 53:55.690
<i>That's why I think
it must be hard to be a boy.</i>

53:57.317 --> 53:59.611
<i>Because they still have no idea
what a man is.</i>

54:01.696 --> 54:03.949
- Is that comfortable?
- It's fine!

54:04.491 --> 54:05.491
Fine.

54:10.789 --> 54:11.789
Is he awake?

54:12.207 --> 54:14.918
Yes, but he's just taken his medicine.

54:15.794 --> 54:16.795
Excuse me.

54:17.837 --> 54:18.837
Stay.

54:19.089 --> 54:20.089
Please.

54:21.049 --> 54:22.550
This will only take a moment.

54:28.598 --> 54:29.766
Father...

54:40.318 --> 54:41.318
Harrison...

54:44.197 --> 54:45.991
I'm afraid your grandson is dead.

54:47.492 --> 54:49.369
We're attending his funeral tomorrow.

54:51.121 --> 54:52.122
My grandson?

54:53.581 --> 54:54.749
Bryce.

54:55.625 --> 54:56.710
Is dead?

54:57.419 --> 54:58.419
Yes.

55:00.964 --> 55:01.964
What the...

55:03.258 --> 55:05.593
What the hell happened?
What have you done?

55:05.677 --> 55:06.845
Where's Bryce?

55:07.637 --> 55:10.265
He's with the mortician,
being prepared for tomorrow.

55:10.348 --> 55:12.267
What have you done to him?

55:12.642 --> 55:14.019
Dad, please, lie down.

55:14.102 --> 55:16.938
Get the fuck out of my way,
I need to see my grandson!

55:17.022 --> 55:19.065
Where's my cane? Bryce!

55:19.149 --> 55:20.942
Get me my cane, God damn it.

55:21.026 --> 55:23.254
- I need my cane.
- You are not to stand. Doctor's orders.

55:23.278 --> 55:24.279
Where's my cane?

55:24.362 --> 55:27.282
Perhaps if you get him his cane
it will help calm him down.

55:27.365 --> 55:29.826
I had the maid store it
in the carriage house.

55:29.909 --> 55:30.910
Amorowat!

55:39.586 --> 55:41.087
