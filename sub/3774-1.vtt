<i>Some of the best writing
in New York won't be found</i>

00:30.075 --> 00:32.709
<i>in books, or movies,
or plays..</i>

00:35.279 --> 00:37.319
<i>...but on the benches
of Central Park.</i>

01:11.015 --> 01:13.083
<i>Read the benches
and you understand.</i>

01:16.354 --> 01:19.656
<i>Enormous things
happen in every life.</i>

01:25.329 --> 01:28.398
<i>On the other hand, some of
the worst writing in New York</i>

01:28.400 --> 01:33.169
<i>could be found at 222
East 30th Street, Apartment 3C.</i>

01:33.171 --> 01:34.771
<i>The walls of which
were decorated</i>

01:34.773 --> 01:37.007
<i>with rejection letters
from magazines</i>

01:37.009 --> 01:40.777
<i>located in 12 countries,
47 states</i>

01:40.779 --> 01:42.545
<i>and the District of Columbia.</i>

01:44.115 --> 01:46.082
<i>When I think
about those stories</i>

01:46.084 --> 01:49.619
<i>and how I didn't realize
what was missing from them</i>

01:49.621 --> 01:52.689
<i>not even tears,
rivers of shame</i>

01:52.691 --> 01:55.091
<i>come out of my eyes.</i>

01:55.093 --> 01:57.694
<i>I wasn't interested
in friends or girlfriends.</i>

01:57.696 --> 02:01.498
<i>All I did was write
and read and mumble to myself.</i>

02:01.500 --> 02:04.334
<i>It's a form
of mental illness really.</i>

02:04.336 --> 02:07.337
<i>Now, in New York, you're never
more than 20 feet away</i>

02:07.339 --> 02:11.274
<i>from someone you know, or
someone you're meant to know.</i>

02:11.276 --> 02:15.478
<i>But in my whole life,
I only crossed the street once.</i>

02:33.731 --> 02:36.232
<i>I might never have thought
of anything to say</i>

02:36.234 --> 02:38.835
<i>but then I smelled
the smoke from her cigarette.</i>

02:38.837 --> 02:41.071
<i>It was heavy,
I recognized it from outside</i>

02:41.073 --> 02:45.575
<i>a restaurant one time, it was
either French or Spanish.</i>

02:45.577 --> 02:46.810
<i>And I didn't speak Spanish.</i>

03:01.225 --> 03:03.345
Shall we continue in English?
Please.

03:05.162 --> 03:08.331
My name is Brian.
May I ask your name?

03:08.333 --> 03:10.500
Arielle.
Arielle.

03:10.502 --> 03:12.502
Like "The Little Mermaid."

03:12.504 --> 03:14.170
What?

03:14.172 --> 03:16.339
"The Little Mermaid,"
it's a Disney film.

03:16.341 --> 03:18.708
The little mermaid's
name was Arielle.

03:18.710 --> 03:22.812
Yes, I'm familiar. Tha...
That's where your mind goes?

03:22.814 --> 03:25.448
She was actually
a very interesting character.

03:25.450 --> 03:27.617
Really?
Yes.

03:27.619 --> 03:32.155
A beautiful woman
who lived in the sea and..

03:32.157 --> 03:36.292
...had the tail of a fish,
and yet she..

03:36.294 --> 03:38.528
Somehow for her,
it all worked.

03:38.530 --> 03:40.597
Did you see it
yesterday or something?

03:40.599 --> 03:42.699
No. When I was 8.

03:42.701 --> 03:45.535
The day before yesterday.

03:45.537 --> 03:47.203
What's the French word for..

03:47.205 --> 03:50.607
<i>Sirene.</i>
<i>Sirene,</i> nice.

03:50.609 --> 03:52.475
Well,<i> enchante,</i> Brian.

03:52.477 --> 03:54.477
<i>Enchante.</i>
Will we meet again?

03:56.380 --> 03:59.782
I would like it very much
if that would happen.

03:59.784 --> 04:01.351
Well, I'm here every Friday

04:01.353 --> 04:04.387
at the close
of lunch in my exile.

04:04.389 --> 04:06.556
You would simply
have to be here as well.

04:08.592 --> 04:10.193
I will be then.

04:10.195 --> 04:11.828
Good. Until next Friday then.

04:13.464 --> 04:15.231
Until next Friday.

04:20.271 --> 04:22.472
Hi, Jim.
How are you today?

04:22.474 --> 04:23.673
Good.

04:25.276 --> 04:27.644
<i>Work is going
very well, dad.</i>

04:27.646 --> 04:31.814
Well, it's gonna sound
stupid, but the fiction editor

04:31.816 --> 04:34.184
from the "Atlantic"
added the word "Sorry"

04:34.186 --> 04:35.818
to the bottom
of my latest rejection.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.353
<i>What the hell
does that mean?</i>

04:37.355 --> 04:39.556
It means I got close.
It's code.

04:39.558 --> 04:41.257
<i>Can we talk
about law school?</i>

04:41.259 --> 04:43.139
No, thank you.
No law school.

04:47.731 --> 04:50.767
<i>Any job worth having
requires a second interview.</i>

04:58.342 --> 05:00.710
I thought perhaps
you wouldn't come.

05:00.712 --> 05:02.845
It never occurred to me.

05:02.847 --> 05:05.415
I mean, because of the rain.

05:05.417 --> 05:06.417
Is it raining?

05:08.686 --> 05:10.386
It was a good test.

05:10.388 --> 05:12.989
A woman has to know what
sort of man she's dealing with.

05:14.558 --> 05:16.859
What sort of man
am I dealing with?

05:16.861 --> 05:18.394
Damp.

05:18.396 --> 05:20.630
A damp sort of man..

05:20.632 --> 05:22.999
...but happy in his dampness.

05:25.336 --> 05:27.737
What sort of woman
am I dealing with?

05:27.739 --> 05:29.239
<i>Une sirene.</i>

05:36.580 --> 05:37.780
Thank you.

05:39.650 --> 05:43.319
So, Brian, what is it
you do in your life

05:43.321 --> 05:45.722
that leaves you free
to wander about the streets

05:45.724 --> 05:49.259
in the afternoons, and smoke
in nooks, and talk to strangers?

05:52.396 --> 05:54.430
I write.

05:54.432 --> 05:55.531
I'm a writer.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.567
Have you published?

05:57.569 --> 05:58.901
No, not yet.

06:00.404 --> 06:02.038
How old are you?

06:02.040 --> 06:04.474
24.

06:04.476 --> 06:06.309
What are your stories about?

06:06.311 --> 06:07.944
<i>Various things.</i>

06:07.946 --> 06:09.846
One is about..

06:09.848 --> 06:10.848
...baseball.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.550
One is about..

06:14.552 --> 06:16.386
...dogs.

06:16.388 --> 06:17.620
Dogs?

06:17.622 --> 06:19.522
Yes.

06:19.524 --> 06:23.726
<i>Uh-huh. So, do you
have any questions for me?</i>

06:23.728 --> 06:25.862
<i>May I ask your profession?</i>

06:25.864 --> 06:28.831
Are you asking me
if I'm a prostitute?

06:28.833 --> 06:31.334
No. No. No.
No. No. No.

06:33.304 --> 06:36.806
Are you... a prostitute?

06:36.808 --> 06:39.375
Certainly not.
How dare you?

06:39.377 --> 06:41.744
You brought it up.
I would have never...

06:41.746 --> 06:43.913
I was a model.
I stopped 8 years ago.

06:45.549 --> 06:48.584
<i>Are you wondering how old I am?</i>

06:48.586 --> 06:49.719
Yes.

06:51.322 --> 06:52.488
I'm 33.

06:57.961 --> 06:59.529
Back to coffee
with your friends?

06:59.531 --> 07:00.531
Yes.

07:01.965 --> 07:03.933
Until next Friday?

07:03.935 --> 07:09.005
Hmm, if you wish, well, I'm
free any weeknight from 5 to 7.

07:09.007 --> 07:12.975
Ah, those are
very specific hours.

07:12.977 --> 07:14.110
Yes, they are.

07:16.046 --> 07:20.083
Alright. Well... shall
we say Monday at 5?

07:20.085 --> 07:22.385
Do you like museums?

07:22.387 --> 07:25.955
Would you meet me
at the Guggenheim?

07:25.957 --> 07:27.657
I'd be delighted.

07:27.659 --> 07:28.825
Good.

07:30.527 --> 07:31.527
Till then, then.

07:33.697 --> 07:34.697
Till then.

07:43.707 --> 07:46.576
No, he... he didn't write,
"We will publish your next story."

07:46.578 --> 07:48.111
Is that what dad told you?

07:48.113 --> 07:51.481
<i>So then, what did he write?</i>
He just wrote, "Sorry."

07:51.483 --> 07:52.915
<i>And were they sorry today?</i>

07:52.917 --> 07:55.685
No, they didn't write sorry
on today's rejections.

07:55.687 --> 07:56.986
<i>Well, that's
a step backward.</i>

07:56.988 --> 07:58.855
It's not a step
backwards, mom.

07:58.857 --> 08:00.823
Progress is not linear.

08:11.135 --> 08:12.402
It's about death.

08:14.705 --> 08:15.838
I beg your pardon?

08:15.840 --> 08:18.007
And menace.

08:18.009 --> 08:20.143
It's about death and menace.

08:20.145 --> 08:23.746
It's a... boat.
A nice boat.

08:23.748 --> 08:26.883
<i>It's near a beautiful beach
and it's... sunny.</i>

08:26.885 --> 08:29.552
Is there any life
on that boat?

08:29.554 --> 08:32.722
No.
And what is the opposite of life?

08:32.724 --> 08:35.124
Death, but...
It's like a neutron bomb went off.

08:35.126 --> 08:37.126
<i>Maybe they're
just below decks.</i>

08:37.128 --> 08:38.828
And it's not just
this painting.

08:38.830 --> 08:41.063
<i>Look at this one. Ha!</i>

08:41.065 --> 08:43.032
This one has people in it.
Dead people.

08:43.034 --> 08:44.567
<i>They're alive.</i>

08:44.569 --> 08:45.935
<i>Not really.
Look at that man.</i>

08:45.937 --> 08:47.770
<i>Is he alive?</i>

08:47.772 --> 08:50.173
<i>And the soda jerk?
Is that any kind of life?</i>

08:50.175 --> 08:51.707
And the prostitute?

08:51.709 --> 08:53.910
Okay, she's not a prostitute.

08:53.912 --> 08:55.812
What is it with you
and prostitutes?

08:55.814 --> 08:57.513
What is she then?

08:57.515 --> 08:58.948
She's..

08:58.950 --> 09:01.050
I don't know,
she's a beautician.

09:01.052 --> 09:02.852
They're all dead.

09:02.854 --> 09:05.488
<i>And the store across the street
is out of business.</i>

09:05.490 --> 09:07.723
<i>And no one lives
in the apartment upstairs.</i>

09:07.725 --> 09:10.960
<i>The tenants have been evicted
and the building condemned.</i>

09:10.962 --> 09:12.962
This Hopper is supposed
to be the quintessential

09:12.964 --> 09:14.964
American painter.

09:14.966 --> 09:18.201
Well, if that's true,
then America is not alive.

09:18.203 --> 09:20.937
America is alive, okay?

09:20.939 --> 09:24.106
And you have a somewhat
downbeat world view.

09:24.108 --> 09:25.475
No, I don't.

09:25.477 --> 09:26.909
And prove it.

09:26.911 --> 09:28.110
Prove what?

09:28.112 --> 09:30.012
That America is still alive.

09:30.014 --> 09:31.247
Look around.

09:34.551 --> 09:36.953
They don't seem particularly
alive to me. Prove it.

09:40.257 --> 09:41.257
Alright.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.587
You may be right,
I don't know.

09:54.805 --> 09:57.740
Your accent is beautiful.

09:57.742 --> 10:00.243
Thank you,
but you're a man infatuated

10:00.245 --> 10:03.112
and so nothing you say
can be believed.

10:03.114 --> 10:05.681
What made you settle
in New York?

10:05.683 --> 10:08.184
I married a diplomat
who was assigned here.

10:08.186 --> 10:09.952
I mean, I wondered
if you'd been married.

10:09.954 --> 10:13.055
What happened to him?
What do you mean?

10:13.057 --> 10:14.824
The person
you were married to.

10:14.826 --> 10:17.793
Were married to?
Well, I'm married to.

10:17.795 --> 10:19.262
Well, nothing happened to him.

10:19.264 --> 10:20.930
He works at
the French Consulate.

10:20.932 --> 10:23.065
It's a few blocks from here.

10:23.067 --> 10:26.235
So... so, you're married?

10:27.871 --> 10:30.239
Of course,
what did you think?

10:30.241 --> 10:33.976
I thought you
were... not married.

10:33.978 --> 10:35.211
Why would you think that?

10:35.213 --> 10:37.079
Why would I not think that?

10:37.081 --> 10:39.982
For one thing, you don't
wear a wedding ring.

10:39.984 --> 10:42.585
So American, you need
a signpost for everything

10:42.587 --> 10:44.186
or you'll completely
lose your way.

10:44.188 --> 10:46.556
It's not just Americans.

10:46.558 --> 10:49.692
Many cultures have
indicators of marriage.

10:49.694 --> 10:53.062
Rings, piercings, dots..

10:53.064 --> 10:56.132
...designed to keep people
out of exactly this sort of..

10:57.301 --> 11:01.137
...awkward situation.

11:01.139 --> 11:03.139
Do you wish you were not
in that situation?

11:03.141 --> 11:06.208
Oh, so we seem to be
mutually pursuing one another.

11:06.210 --> 11:07.944
Yes, so?

11:07.946 --> 11:10.646
Well, I, uh..

11:10.648 --> 11:12.214
I would have thought
you'd mention...

11:12.216 --> 11:14.684
Well, must everything
be mentioned?

11:14.686 --> 11:16.686
Can nothing be culled from the subtext?
Well...

11:16.688 --> 11:19.255
Do you not understand
the meaning of 5 to 7?

11:19.257 --> 11:21.958
Was my confusion about 5 to 7
somehow unclear

11:21.960 --> 11:24.760
because I thought I was
very clear about my confusion.

11:24.762 --> 11:27.196
I thought you were kidding.

11:27.198 --> 11:31.167
No. No.
I was actually confused.

11:31.169 --> 11:33.102
And what did you think
I meant when I said

11:33.104 --> 11:35.771
I was only free at those hours?

11:35.773 --> 11:37.707
I thought you had
a very busy schedule

11:37.709 --> 11:41.143
or you were unprepared
to spend the later

11:41.145 --> 11:45.181
and definitionally sexier hour
with someone you hardly knew.

11:45.183 --> 11:49.185
Oh... it was a code.

11:49.187 --> 11:51.087
A code.

11:51.089 --> 11:54.724
<i>Un cinq a sept,</i>
uh, a 5 to 7 relationship

11:54.726 --> 11:59.395
is a relationship
outside of marriage.

11:59.397 --> 12:03.032
Seriously the French actually
block out time for that?

12:03.034 --> 12:04.700
No.

12:04.702 --> 12:07.136
1 to 3 lunch,
3 to 5 conference call.

12:07.138 --> 12:09.639
5 to 7 commit adultery.
Look...

12:09.641 --> 12:11.707
Do you set aside time
to break other commandments?

12:11.709 --> 12:14.844
Do you covet at 9:30? Worship
false idols from 10 to noon?

12:14.846 --> 12:19.815
It's not literal.
It's an expression.

12:19.817 --> 12:22.251
It re... refers to a time
in the evening

12:22.253 --> 12:24.954
where a person's whereabouts

12:24.956 --> 12:26.876
might naturally be
a little hazy.

12:28.892 --> 12:30.426
Okay, I have a very good
French dictionary

12:30.428 --> 12:32.795
and that is definitely
not in there.

12:32.797 --> 12:34.363
No, it wouldn't be.

12:34.365 --> 12:36.165
Now, back in the day

12:36.167 --> 12:39.935
such things did tend to happen
from 5 to 7, I think.

12:39.937 --> 12:41.971
But these days,
they happen all the time

12:41.973 --> 12:45.341
but my husband and I,
we have found that..

12:45.343 --> 12:47.910
...the original hours
work very well.

12:47.912 --> 12:52.348
They provide a set window
and... clear boundaries.

12:52.350 --> 12:55.985
I guess, that makes us
old-fashioned.

12:55.987 --> 12:57.353
Yes, entirely.

12:59.356 --> 13:01.857
So, your husband does this too?

13:01.859 --> 13:05.227
He has a mistress.
Her name is Jane.

13:05.229 --> 13:07.163
And you know her?

13:07.165 --> 13:09.865
From time to time,
I see her at social functions.

13:15.105 --> 13:17.940
Well, nothing
is ever flaunted

13:17.942 --> 13:20.476
and so, no one
is ever embarrassed.

13:20.478 --> 13:25.748
And everyone is okay
with everyone.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.710
This is how
we've chosen to live.

13:34.991 --> 13:37.860
One day, I will stand
next to her at his funeral.

13:39.996 --> 13:41.916
Is that gonna
be anytime soon?

13:43.967 --> 13:47.103
I am sure what I'm saying
sounds terribly tawdry

13:47.105 --> 13:48.105
and hedonistic.

13:49.906 --> 13:51.240
A little.

13:51.242 --> 13:53.275
Well, it isn't.

13:53.277 --> 13:56.145
We have our reasons
for the choices we've made.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.183
<i>Do you have children?</i>

14:01.185 --> 14:03.886
Two. Would you
like to see pictures?

14:03.888 --> 14:04.888
Yes.

14:07.758 --> 14:09.792
Marc is 7
and Elodie is 6.

14:12.395 --> 14:14.396
They're beautiful.
Thank you.

14:14.398 --> 14:15.638
They are the lights of my life.

14:22.239 --> 14:25.174
You're really thrown
by all this, aren't you?

14:25.176 --> 14:29.145
I, uh, yes. Uh-huh.

14:29.147 --> 14:33.115
I must say that in my culture
it's not judged so harshly.

14:33.117 --> 14:35.217
Okay, but we're not
in your culture.

14:35.219 --> 14:37.820
We're in my culture
and in my culture

14:37.822 --> 14:39.855
if we didn't have things
to judge harshly

14:39.857 --> 14:42.224
we wouldn't know
what to do all day.

14:42.226 --> 14:45.427
Well, maybe your culture
needs to grow.

14:45.429 --> 14:47.549
Maybe there are other ways
to look at life.

14:50.534 --> 14:54.436
Maybe there are some people
you marry

14:54.438 --> 14:55.905
and people you love.

14:58.141 --> 15:02.812
Arielle, you're older
than I am, you're wiser I'm sure

15:02.814 --> 15:05.181
and you've seen much more
of the world.

15:07.150 --> 15:10.252
And you're beautiful,
and elegant

15:10.254 --> 15:13.222
and smart, and funny

15:13.224 --> 15:14.957
and interesting

15:14.959 --> 15:19.128
and you feel like family,
which is wonderful.

15:19.130 --> 15:21.297
Are you seriously telling me
that a but is coming

15:21.299 --> 15:23.299
at the end of the sentence?

15:23.301 --> 15:27.036
Yes, but... being with you

15:27.038 --> 15:29.338
would be... an affair

15:29.340 --> 15:30.539
and to me..

15:32.275 --> 15:33.509
...not ethical.

15:35.078 --> 15:36.078
Unethical.

15:37.247 --> 15:39.315
Not good... ethically.

15:44.487 --> 15:48.257
I must respect your ethics
if I ask you to respect mine.

15:52.596 --> 15:55.331
Should you change your mind,
I will continue to be out there

15:55.333 --> 15:56.866
smoking nook on Fridays.

15:59.236 --> 16:01.203
But if I never see you again

16:01.205 --> 16:02.404
do know that..

16:04.608 --> 16:06.688
...I will always remember you
very fondly.

16:12.082 --> 16:13.082
Are you okay?

16:15.986 --> 16:17.866
I'm sad.
It was the beginning.

16:19.556 --> 16:20.556
Of what?

16:23.593 --> 16:24.593
Belief.

16:43.146 --> 16:46.949
<i>The following Friday
right about after lunchtime</i>

16:46.951 --> 16:48.951
<i>the pace of work began to slow.</i>

16:53.290 --> 16:57.059
<i>I knew where she was and it was
all I could think about.</i>

16:59.095 --> 17:00.496
<i>By the Friday after that..</i>

17:02.299 --> 17:04.465
<i>Well, look,
French girls just aren't good</i>

17:04.468 --> 17:05.548
<i>for your work habits.</i>

17:07.002 --> 17:09.003
<i>And it killed me..</i>

17:09.006 --> 17:11.126
<i>...that she was lighting
her own cigarette.</i>

17:13.476 --> 17:15.477
<i>By the Friday after that..</i>

17:47.410 --> 17:49.545
I can't believe
it took you 3 weeks.

17:52.082 --> 17:53.082
Sorry.

17:55.285 --> 17:57.619
So... what happens now?

18:00.223 --> 18:02.691
Room 2117, 5 o'clock.

19:21.204 --> 19:22.204
<i>Use your key.</i>

19:39.456 --> 19:40.456
How are you?

19:41.691 --> 19:44.526
Very well. Thank you.

19:44.528 --> 19:46.261
And you?

19:46.263 --> 19:48.330
Very well.

19:48.332 --> 19:50.666
Will you have some champagne?

19:50.668 --> 19:51.834
Please.

19:54.404 --> 19:57.773
Always look the person in
the eye when you touch glasses.

19:57.775 --> 20:01.143
I know.
7 years of bad luck.

20:01.145 --> 20:03.579
Bad luck?
That's the American version?

20:03.581 --> 20:06.515
Yes. What's the French?

20:06.517 --> 20:09.251
7 years of bad sex.

20:09.253 --> 20:10.253
Good Lord.

20:12.455 --> 20:13.889
I think that
tells you everything

20:13.891 --> 20:16.658
you need to know
about our two cultures.

20:16.660 --> 20:20.796
Yes. Yours is
very optimistic.

20:20.798 --> 20:24.533
I mean, a lot of people after,
like, year 5 of bad sex

20:24.535 --> 20:27.436
they'd give up, but you guys
really hang in there.

20:27.438 --> 20:29.238
It's admirable.
Thank you.

20:31.741 --> 20:35.711
At any rate, best to look
the other person in the eye.

20:35.713 --> 20:36.912
Yes.

20:45.522 --> 20:47.422
Are you nervous?

20:47.424 --> 20:49.858
Oh, no.
I do this all the time.

20:51.495 --> 20:53.395
I am.

20:53.397 --> 20:54.863
What?

20:54.865 --> 20:57.232
Nervous.
I am nervous around you.

20:59.402 --> 21:00.936
That's ridiculous.

21:00.938 --> 21:03.572
Good nervous,
I mean, uh, like a girl.

21:05.775 --> 21:07.176
Well, you don't show it.

21:08.645 --> 21:09.685
I should hope not.

21:12.315 --> 21:16.919
Sometimes life
is... really something.

21:20.256 --> 21:22.336
Maybe you should write
fortune cookies.

22:50.013 --> 22:52.347
Are you alright?

22:52.349 --> 22:54.283
I was just thinking

22:54.285 --> 22:57.819
I never did a semester
abroad in college and I..

22:57.821 --> 23:00.956
...really regret that now.

23:00.958 --> 23:02.158
<i>It was completely different.</i>

23:03.593 --> 23:06.628
From your expectations?

23:06.630 --> 23:07.896
From the past.

23:07.898 --> 23:09.598
<i>Good.</i>

23:09.600 --> 23:11.600
Because I was about to say
the same.

23:13.603 --> 23:14.636
Really?

23:17.540 --> 23:20.375
Wow. Good for me.

23:20.377 --> 23:22.944
<i>Just so you know,
you're a natural lover.</i>

23:22.946 --> 23:25.266
<i>Your body expresses beautifully
what's in your heart.</i>

23:27.583 --> 23:30.619
I'm just gonna write
that down.

23:30.621 --> 23:32.321
<i>Have none of the other women
you've been with</i>

23:32.323 --> 23:33.622
<i>told you these things?</i>

23:33.624 --> 23:36.825
Uh, no.

23:36.827 --> 23:39.861
Wow. Good for me.

23:39.863 --> 23:42.597
<i>How do you do that?</i>

23:42.599 --> 23:43.665
What?

23:43.667 --> 23:46.635
Look like that,
in 30 seconds.

23:58.815 --> 23:59.981
Do you have to go?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.120
There's a fundraiser
at my children's school.

24:09.759 --> 24:12.861
Please don't take this
the wrong way

24:12.863 --> 24:16.965
but it suddenly seems..

24:16.967 --> 24:19.087
...impossible to me
that you have that life.

24:22.505 --> 24:23.839
I don't take it
the wrong way.

24:23.841 --> 24:25.881
Actually, it seems impossible
to me too.

24:28.544 --> 24:30.744
It will until the moment
I next see my children.

24:33.783 --> 24:37.085
I did wanna ask you
something, if you don't mind.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.422
What you said about belief..

24:42.892 --> 24:45.560
...what did you mean?
Can you say more?

24:50.833 --> 24:52.134
It's almost 7.

25:06.182 --> 25:08.784
Will I see you tomorrow?

25:08.786 --> 25:10.886
No. Monday.

25:10.888 --> 25:13.488
5. The same room.

25:13.490 --> 25:14.956
Hold on to the key.

25:14.958 --> 25:16.091
Trust me.

25:25.802 --> 25:28.904
Say, "Till then, then"
like you did that time.

25:30.873 --> 25:31.940
Till then, then.

25:35.812 --> 25:36.812
I like that.

25:44.621 --> 25:47.722
<i>I was way, way
too happy to write.</i>

25:50.593 --> 25:53.728
<i>It was not a good weekend
for the Venetian wines.</i>

26:04.774 --> 26:07.676
Can no American watch
a film without popcorn?

26:07.678 --> 26:09.478
That's right.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.547
Do you chomp popcorn
when you read literature?

26:12.549 --> 26:14.983
I eat sunflower seeds
and I spit the shells

26:14.985 --> 26:16.218
into a little cup.

26:20.656 --> 26:23.625
I cannot kiss you
goodbye outdoors.

26:23.627 --> 26:25.794
I understand.

26:25.796 --> 26:29.631
People can see us together.
That is permitted.

26:29.633 --> 26:33.835
I can take your arm,
but we cannot kiss.

26:33.837 --> 26:38.106
If those are the rules...
those are the rules.

26:49.119 --> 26:51.219
<i>Between the hours
of 7 and 5</i>

26:51.221 --> 26:54.055
<i>I made a study
of French culture.</i>

26:58.761 --> 27:01.563
<i>They seemed to be,
uh, strange people.</i>

27:05.935 --> 27:09.170
<i>But then, I'm sure she thought
my people were strange too.</i>

27:09.172 --> 27:12.707
So I lost my virginity
on Passover.

27:12.709 --> 27:15.677
Passover?
<i>Yeah. Do you know what that is?</i>

27:15.679 --> 27:17.812
<i>I don't know what you..
No, what does that mean?</i>

27:17.814 --> 27:19.714
<i>It's a Jewish holiday.
Yeah?</i>

27:19.716 --> 27:22.817
Where you eat <i> matzah,</i>
which is unleavened bread.

27:22.819 --> 27:24.219
Strange.
Yeah.

27:24.221 --> 27:27.188
How was it?
Yeah. You mean the <i> matzah?</i>

27:27.190 --> 27:29.057
Or my... the loss of my virginity?
The <i> matzah,</i> of course.

27:29.059 --> 27:30.892
The <i> matzah.</i>
Yeah. Now the <i> matzah</i> was great.

27:30.894 --> 27:34.563
It,<i> matzah</i> doesn't really
change over the years.

27:34.565 --> 27:36.231
<i>Sometimes
our two-hour interludes</i>

27:36.233 --> 27:39.034
<i>were calm and prosaic.</i>

27:39.036 --> 27:41.336
Oh, no.
What?

27:41.338 --> 27:43.672
I have some troubling news.
What?

27:46.842 --> 27:49.945
I don't think the boat
we're controlling is our boat.

27:49.947 --> 27:51.212
Are you..
What?

27:51.214 --> 27:55.050
Are you kidding me?
No.

27:55.052 --> 27:57.218
Where is our boat?
I have no idea.

28:00.657 --> 28:03.091
<i>Sometimes they were not
so calm.</i>

28:43.199 --> 28:45.166
Mmm, mmm.

28:58.781 --> 29:00.815
Brian.

29:00.817 --> 29:02.283
Yes?

29:02.285 --> 29:04.386
<i>Please join me.</i>

29:04.388 --> 29:06.054
By all means, bring your food.

29:16.899 --> 29:18.499
Sh..
Mm-hmm.

29:21.003 --> 29:23.938
Hello, I'm Arielle's
husband, Valery.

29:25.841 --> 29:28.176
<i>Enchante.
Enchante.</i>

29:30.312 --> 29:34.049
Please forgive any
hot dog related moisture.

29:34.051 --> 29:36.184
Only if you will forgive
my intrusion.

29:38.421 --> 29:41.122
I...I thought we should meet.

29:43.059 --> 29:44.993
Arielle speaks
very highly of you.

29:44.995 --> 29:47.962
She does?

29:47.964 --> 29:48.997
To you?

29:48.999 --> 29:50.432
Mm-hmm.

29:50.434 --> 29:52.354
She says you're
a very fine person.

29:54.870 --> 29:57.038
Funny, naturally charming

29:57.040 --> 30:00.809
sincere,
extremely bright, kind.

30:00.811 --> 30:03.178
<i>She suspects
you're very talented.</i>

30:05.915 --> 30:07.982
Thank you.

30:07.984 --> 30:10.952
I'm very happy that
she has met you, Brian.

30:10.954 --> 30:14.189
<i>For the little time
since she has known you</i>

30:14.191 --> 30:19.794
I have seen a light in her eyes
that I had never seen before.

30:19.796 --> 30:22.797
<i>And I'm so very glad of it.
I wish to thank you.</i>

30:24.900 --> 30:27.869
You're welcome.

30:27.871 --> 30:30.505
I would be pleased if you
cared to join us at our home

30:30.507 --> 30:33.341
this coming Saturday for supper.

30:33.343 --> 30:34.876
Really?

30:34.878 --> 30:37.512
Yes.

30:37.514 --> 30:41.149
Is there any chance that
this is a gentlemanly ploy

30:41.151 --> 30:43.485
designed to relax me

30:43.487 --> 30:45.787
<i>before your driver turns around</i>

30:45.789 --> 30:48.389
and impales me
with a <i> fleur-de-lis?</i>

30:48.391 --> 30:49.457
None.

30:51.260 --> 30:52.393
<i>Well, then..</i>

30:53.929 --> 30:55.430
...I thank you
for the invitation

30:55.432 --> 30:58.032
and I look forward to attending.

30:58.034 --> 30:59.034
<i>Good.</i>

30:59.035 --> 31:02.337
173 East 77th.

31:02.339 --> 31:03.505
7:30?

31:06.108 --> 31:09.244
How did he find out? Was it
a credit card bill or something?

31:09.246 --> 31:11.479
I told him.
I beg your pardon?

31:11.481 --> 31:14.182
With great joy.
You just volunteered it?

31:14.184 --> 31:16.084
<i>Of course.</i>

31:16.086 --> 31:19.220
Why?
<i>Because he's my husband.</i>

31:19.222 --> 31:23.858
Uh-huh. And did you know
about this invitation?

31:23.860 --> 31:25.527
<i>No. I'm not
surprised though.</i>

31:25.529 --> 31:27.495
<i>Valery does lovely things
like this.</i>

31:27.497 --> 31:30.198
How is this a lovely thing?

31:30.200 --> 31:34.335
To me, this is a wildly,
wildly <i> awkward</i> thing.

31:34.337 --> 31:36.371
<i>I don't know
what he has in mind.</i>

31:36.373 --> 31:38.873
You must understand,
this is between you and him.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.475
You have your own
relationship now.

31:40.477 --> 31:42.243
We do?
If you want it.

31:42.245 --> 31:44.946
I highly recommend it
to you, by the way.

31:44.948 --> 31:46.347
You will come to treasure
his friendship.

31:46.349 --> 31:49.284
He's that sort of person.

31:49.286 --> 31:54.088
And somehow Saturday night will
be thoughtful and wonderful.

31:54.090 --> 31:55.490
You'll see.

31:59.595 --> 32:01.296
You don't understand
things yet, do you?

32:01.298 --> 32:02.298
Uh, no.

32:04.133 --> 32:07.001
I feel guilty.

32:07.003 --> 32:08.970
Why would you feel guilty
if he's happy for us?

32:08.972 --> 32:11.840
Because I don't
understand things yet.

32:11.842 --> 32:15.276
Put aside your notions
about how people are, Brian.

32:15.278 --> 32:18.179
The world will surprise you
with its grace if you let it.

32:20.583 --> 32:21.616
Unclasp me?

32:49.044 --> 32:51.412
Brian Bloom.
I believe I'm expected.

32:51.414 --> 32:53.248
What? Don't say that.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.983
Brian Bloom. Invited guest.

32:54.985 --> 32:56.951
No, no, that's silly.

32:56.953 --> 33:01.356
Hi. Uh, Brian Bloom
reporting for dinner.

33:01.358 --> 33:03.158
<i>Please come in.</i>
Thanks.

33:09.498 --> 33:12.267
Oh. Hello.

33:12.269 --> 33:14.669
Good evening.
May I take your coat?

33:16.572 --> 33:18.506
Uh, sure.

33:33.589 --> 33:34.689
Thank you.

33:39.395 --> 33:40.995
Right this way
for the elevator.

33:40.997 --> 33:41.997
Elevator?

33:47.069 --> 33:49.149
Good evening,
and welcome to our home.

33:50.639 --> 33:52.307
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:02.451 --> 34:05.286
Brian. Come in. Come in.

34:05.288 --> 34:06.721
Glad you're here.

34:06.723 --> 34:09.724
<i>Your children are amazing.</i>
Ha ha, thank you.

34:09.726 --> 34:11.993
<i>Are they real or are
they from a catalogue?</i>

34:11.995 --> 34:13.594
Uh, they are
from a catalogue.

34:13.596 --> 34:15.196
Come and meet some people.

34:15.197 --> 34:17.598
Everyone, this is our
dear friend, Brian Bloom

34:17.600 --> 34:22.337
who also happens to be one of
the most talented young writers.

34:22.339 --> 34:25.373
Brian, do you know
Maestro Alan Gilbert?

34:25.375 --> 34:27.175
Pleasure.
<i>It's a great pleasure, maestro.</i>

34:27.177 --> 34:28.643
<i>Mr. Julian Bond.</i>

34:28.645 --> 34:30.445
<i>True honor, sir.</i>
Delighted.

34:30.447 --> 34:33.348
<i>And Mr. Daniel Boulud.</i>
A pleasure.

34:33.350 --> 34:36.016
<i>I look forward to one day
being able to afford</i>

34:36.018 --> 34:37.618
<i>to eat in one
of your restaurants, sir.</i>

34:37.620 --> 34:40.288
Nonsense. Nonsense.
I'll give you my card later.

34:40.290 --> 34:43.056
And I'll tell Kareem to take
very good care of you.

34:43.059 --> 34:46.194
And this is our friend,
Jane Hastings.

34:46.196 --> 34:47.996
<i>How do you do?</i>
Nice to meet you.

34:47.998 --> 34:52.400
<i>Now, Jane is an editor
at Farrar, Strauss and Giroux</i>

34:52.402 --> 34:55.003
<i>and perhaps this is the first
of many handshakes</i>

34:55.005 --> 34:56.170
<i>between you two.</i>

34:56.172 --> 34:57.405
<i>Ah, you're here.</i>

35:01.477 --> 35:05.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
three of my favorite words.

35:05.482 --> 35:08.383
Dinner is served.

35:08.385 --> 35:09.425
<i>This way, please.</i>

35:18.728 --> 35:22.764
<i>You, maestro, though immortal
are not a God but a man.</i>

35:28.237 --> 35:30.805
We know God can be kind.
He can be joyful.

35:30.807 --> 35:32.507
But we also know
He can be annoying.

35:32.509 --> 35:35.276
What kind of a God
is that now,<i> maestro?</i>

35:35.278 --> 35:37.745
I've listened to my
own recordings at times

35:37.747 --> 35:41.382
and wanted to kill everything in
the room, myself, the composer.

35:42.419 --> 35:44.052
<i>Even if the composer is dead.</i>

35:46.755 --> 35:49.690
Ah, and at those times,
He can be vengeful?

35:49.692 --> 35:51.259
Oh, yes.

35:51.261 --> 35:54.562
Not if we're made
strictly in His image.

35:54.564 --> 35:56.464
Exactly.

36:08.210 --> 36:10.411
Goodnight, maestro.

36:10.413 --> 36:12.333
Enough already
with the maestro.

36:14.083 --> 36:15.750
He seemed to like it.

36:15.752 --> 36:18.786
I'm kidding.

36:18.788 --> 36:22.190
So tonight actually
happened you're saying.

36:22.192 --> 36:23.324
You'll get used to it.

36:30.265 --> 36:32.200
Julian Bond
sure didn't eat much.

36:32.202 --> 36:35.403
He's just very polite.

36:35.405 --> 36:38.272
Oh, God, should I not have
had seconds on the little hens?

36:38.274 --> 36:40.741
It was fine.
Alan Gilbert had seconds.

36:40.743 --> 36:43.111
It was fine. Don't worry.

36:49.618 --> 36:51.686
Split it?
Sure.

37:08.837 --> 37:12.240
You seem to know
the ropes very well.

37:12.242 --> 37:14.242
Have you been with
Valery for a while?

37:16.478 --> 37:18.412
A year.

37:18.414 --> 37:20.681
Could I ask you something?

37:20.683 --> 37:23.317
Do you ever think to yourself

37:23.319 --> 37:26.487
"What the heck am I doing?
This is crazy."

37:26.489 --> 37:27.788
No.

37:27.790 --> 37:29.724
Well, then would you tell me

37:29.726 --> 37:33.327
what the heck am I doing?
Because this is crazy.

37:33.329 --> 37:36.430
You're being happy.
Just like I am.

37:36.432 --> 37:38.833
But don't you want
a relationship with a future?

37:38.835 --> 37:40.935
I'm 25 years old.

37:40.937 --> 37:43.571
There's plenty of time
for a future.

37:43.573 --> 37:44.573
I guess.

37:45.807 --> 37:49.710
Life is a collection
of moments.

37:49.712 --> 37:54.415
The idea is to have as
many good ones as you can.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.418
See, I was taught that
there are no free lunches.

37:57.420 --> 38:00.922
That one day the rent comes due,
the other shoe drops

38:00.924 --> 38:04.492
and you suffer a thousand-fold.

38:04.494 --> 38:06.694
Who raised you?
Jews.

38:08.463 --> 38:11.832
Look, if you wanna be
a good writer

38:11.834 --> 38:13.834
then you can't have
a mediocre life.

38:16.638 --> 38:18.306
I'll give you
a baseball metaphor

38:18.308 --> 38:20.228
because Jewish writers
love them.

38:22.477 --> 38:23.678
Swing from the heels.

38:24.947 --> 38:25.980
Okay, Brian Bloom?

38:27.616 --> 38:28.749
Okay.

38:30.419 --> 38:33.788
I look forward to
the next time we see each other.

38:33.790 --> 38:35.830
And to the evolution
of your attitudes.

38:37.526 --> 38:39.527
You are a natural editor.

38:45.334 --> 38:47.835
Where did this idea
come from?

38:47.837 --> 38:52.607
Oh, you know, I'm just trying
to... swing from the heels.

38:52.609 --> 38:56.277
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Ah, no worries... mom.

38:56.279 --> 38:58.679
Ariel.
Arielle, mom.

38:58.681 --> 39:01.949
Arlene Bloom. How do you do?
<i>Enchante.</i>

39:01.951 --> 39:03.718
Where's dad?
<i>Parking.</i>

39:03.720 --> 39:05.886
This neighborhood
is a nightmare.

39:05.888 --> 39:07.755
There are plenty of garages.

39:07.757 --> 39:09.890
Have you forgotten
who we're dealing with?

39:09.892 --> 39:11.492
Dad refuses
to pay for parking.

39:11.494 --> 39:13.527
He says it's highway robbery.

39:13.529 --> 39:15.029
And he's absolutely right.

39:15.031 --> 39:16.564
Brian, would you ask
the waiter

39:16.566 --> 39:18.032
if they have a different chair?

39:18.034 --> 39:21.002
Sorry?
My back is killing me.

39:21.004 --> 39:22.903
Uh, I think all the chairs
are pretty much the same.

39:22.905 --> 39:26.407
Oh, excuse me.
Could I trouble you for a different chair?

39:26.409 --> 39:28.809
Excuse me?
Something with better back support.

39:28.811 --> 39:30.711
I'm afraid we don't
have any other chair.

39:30.713 --> 39:32.747
No folding chairs
in the back?

39:32.749 --> 39:34.749
<i>Mm, I don't think
we have any.</i>

39:34.751 --> 39:37.285
It's fine. I'll stand.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.287
You'll stand?
It's fine.

39:40.656 --> 39:43.524
It's highway robbery
parking in this burg.

39:43.526 --> 39:45.393
Hi, dad.
Hiya, pal.

39:45.395 --> 39:47.995
I finally had to say <i> "Oncle"</i>
and put it in a garage.

39:49.965 --> 39:51.832
Your mother is standing.
I know.

39:51.834 --> 39:53.868
They have no
folding chairs here.

39:53.870 --> 39:57.638
It's The Carlyle, Arlene.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.840
You know when we first met,
she only sent back entrees.

39:59.842 --> 40:01.309
Now it's chairs.

40:02.544 --> 40:05.913
Dad, may I introduce
Arielle Pierpont?

40:05.915 --> 40:07.982
<i>Enchante.</i>
Oh, no.

40:07.984 --> 40:10.518
I am the one who is enchanted.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.653
That's right.
I studied your language.

40:31.039 --> 40:35.443
Dad, the meaning
of the verb,<i> "baiser"</i>

40:35.445 --> 40:39.747
which used to mean to kiss has
changed a bit over the years.

40:39.749 --> 40:41.449
It has?
Yes.

40:42.517 --> 40:43.818
What does it mean now?

40:45.921 --> 40:47.421
It means to fuck.

40:47.423 --> 40:49.090
Oh, God.

40:49.092 --> 40:51.425
Pardon my French.
Not at all.

40:51.427 --> 40:55.396
Seriously though, $42
for 2 hours plus tip

40:55.398 --> 40:57.832
and then on top of that,
after this, we have to drive

40:57.834 --> 40:59.900
all the way across town
to another parking lot

40:59.902 --> 41:02.903
We're seeing
"The Book Of Mormon."

41:02.905 --> 41:06.674
Not the original
cast... but still.

41:06.676 --> 41:08.809
Yeah.
It's the replacement Mormons.

41:08.811 --> 41:11.445
You know it actually might be
less expensive if we leave

41:11.447 --> 41:12.980
the car in the East Side,
then we take a taxi

41:12.982 --> 41:14.682
to the theater and back.

41:14.684 --> 41:17.551
Maybe could we strategize
later on the parking?

41:17.553 --> 41:19.920
What can I get for you?
Table water for me, please.

41:19.922 --> 41:21.889
Flat or sparkling?
No, just table water.

41:21.891 --> 41:22.957
Tap water?
Yes.

41:22.959 --> 41:24.525
With ice?
Yes.

41:24.527 --> 41:26.861
I think I'm gonna have
a vodka martini.

41:26.863 --> 41:28.729
You'll be passed out
by intermission

41:28.731 --> 41:31.999
and I'll have to sing the second
act in the car on the way home.

41:32.001 --> 41:34.502
I would drink, but I may
have to drive across town.

41:34.504 --> 41:36.470
Yes. You've mentioned that.

41:36.472 --> 41:38.439
Vodka martini
sounds wonderful.

41:38.441 --> 41:40.908
One for me too, please.
You think we'll even find a cab?

41:40.910 --> 41:42.777
With a syringe, if you would.

41:42.779 --> 41:44.612
<i>Tout de suite.
Merci.</i>

41:44.614 --> 41:48.516
So, first of all,
did you ever hear anybody

41:48.518 --> 41:50.651
speak better school-taught
French than this kid?

41:50.653 --> 41:52.953
99 on the Regents Exam.

41:52.955 --> 41:55.089
<i>And he knows
the current usage.</i>

41:55.091 --> 41:56.891
And this is within
his whole life

41:56.893 --> 41:59.160
not one day out of the country.

41:59.162 --> 42:01.061
Something of which
I'm very proud.

42:01.063 --> 42:03.631
So, it's nice
the schedule worked out.

42:03.633 --> 42:06.200
Brian says you're only free
till 7.

42:06.202 --> 42:07.835
That's right.

42:07.837 --> 42:09.637
<i>So, Arielle</i>

42:09.639 --> 42:12.807
of whom my son
speaks in golden tones

42:12.809 --> 42:15.543
tell us about yourself.

42:15.545 --> 42:19.079
Well, I am 33, married,
and the mother of two.

42:26.221 --> 42:27.588
Waiter.

42:28.990 --> 42:30.224
Canadian Club.

42:31.593 --> 42:33.461
<i>A married French woman</i>

42:33.463 --> 42:36.831
33 years of age,
with two children.

42:36.833 --> 42:39.767
You could stop that sentence
anywhere along the way

42:39.769 --> 42:41.902
and have reason enough
not to be in the relationship.

42:41.904 --> 42:43.537
Dad...

42:43.539 --> 42:45.239
These are the same French
who didn't let us

42:45.241 --> 42:47.241
fly over their country
on the way to Khadafi.

42:47.243 --> 42:48.943
Okay, but it's not
her Frenchness

42:48.945 --> 42:49.977
that's really bothering you...

42:49.979 --> 42:51.111
No, but I can't discuss

42:51.113 --> 42:53.514
her marital or parental status

42:53.516 --> 42:56.951
because if I do,
my pancreas will explode.

42:56.953 --> 43:00.221
So instead, I'm dwelling
on the relatively benign

43:00.223 --> 43:04.592
but still objectionable issue
of her Frenchness.

43:04.594 --> 43:05.594
Okay.

43:05.595 --> 43:07.194
In the war, the French

43:07.196 --> 43:08.863
couldn't wait
to give up their Jews.

43:08.865 --> 43:10.231
Nobody could
wait to give up...

43:10.233 --> 43:13.267
Also, they surrendered
3 times in the same war.

43:13.269 --> 43:15.569
Have you any idea
how hard that is to do?

43:15.571 --> 43:16.937
What does that have
to do with anything?

43:16.939 --> 43:19.106
Because this is who
you're dealing with.

43:20.842 --> 43:24.612
Mimi and Joe Fabercamp
went to Paris for their 25th

43:24.614 --> 43:27.214
and they said, "It was
a festival of rudeness."

43:27.216 --> 43:29.116
And Joe even had a phrase book.

43:29.118 --> 43:31.218
And his cousin, once removed

43:31.220 --> 43:34.722
was at Omaha Beach,
unbelievable in gratitude.

43:34.724 --> 43:37.224
$42, please.
Jesus Christ.

43:49.804 --> 43:52.239
I really hope you know
what you're doing, my boy.

43:53.909 --> 43:57.678
I really hope this does not turn
out to be one of those decisions

43:57.680 --> 44:01.115
that takes a perfectly good life
and turns it for the worse.

44:02.751 --> 44:04.318
It won't.

44:07.589 --> 44:09.723
Now what the hell
is going on over there?

44:12.127 --> 44:13.294
Look at that, dad.

44:14.596 --> 44:15.863
She fucked her twice.

44:24.873 --> 44:28.208
Arlene... you wanna
weigh in, please

44:28.210 --> 44:31.879
on the subject of <i> la femme</i>
Robinson over there?

44:31.881 --> 44:33.347
Or are you just gonna
leave your husband

44:33.349 --> 44:35.249
to fight this battle himself?

44:35.251 --> 44:37.651
Just like that time
at karaoke night

44:37.653 --> 44:40.921
when you dropped the microphone,
walked off and left me

44:40.923 --> 44:43.624
because you couldn't read the
lyrics to "It Had To Be You."

44:45.126 --> 44:46.860
It's good you've let that go.

44:50.865 --> 44:54.835
I think that there
are two forces on Earth

44:54.837 --> 44:57.071
you never want to be fighting.

44:57.073 --> 44:59.206
One is Mother Nature.

44:59.208 --> 45:01.141
The other is love.

45:01.143 --> 45:03.310
What?
She's lovely.

45:04.980 --> 45:07.181
It's not an ideal situation

45:07.183 --> 45:09.383
but she adores my son.

45:10.852 --> 45:13.087
Now how can you be
a sensible parent

45:13.089 --> 45:16.256
and not feel warmly towards
someone who adores your child?

45:18.226 --> 45:21.161
That is
practically... anti-social.

45:21.163 --> 45:25.132
Okay. So I'm anti-social.

45:25.134 --> 45:26.867
Not news.

45:26.869 --> 45:29.303
Besides, I'm not telling
you that I don't like her.

45:29.305 --> 45:31.145
I hardly know her.
Exactly.

45:33.942 --> 45:37.344
I hope you don't mind, Bri,
but Arielle gave me her number.

45:37.346 --> 45:39.313
We're gonna go shopping

45:39.315 --> 45:41.715
and she's gonna teach me
how to walk like her.

45:50.158 --> 45:52.860
I cannot tell you how little

45:52.862 --> 45:55.029
I wanna see a Broadway
show right now.

46:03.805 --> 46:08.108
It's one of two things...
or possibly both.

46:09.144 --> 46:10.177
What is?

46:12.814 --> 46:16.450
Either no one is immune
to your charms..

46:18.887 --> 46:22.456
...or the world really can
surprise you with its grace.

46:30.231 --> 46:31.365
What?

46:34.803 --> 46:35.803
<i>Je t'aime.</i>

46:38.139 --> 46:39.707
Just for the record.

46:49.484 --> 46:53.020
Okay, we'll start
very simply.

46:56.024 --> 46:58.058
Taste, please, this glass.

47:06.267 --> 47:07.468
Is it white or red?

47:11.039 --> 47:12.239
Red.

47:13.942 --> 47:16.143
My, God.
Ah! Really?

47:16.145 --> 47:17.344
You gotta be shitting me.

47:18.947 --> 47:21.148
You have the palate
of a water buffalo.

47:22.751 --> 47:24.084
That is about to change.

47:25.954 --> 47:29.123
Replace the blindfold, please.

47:29.125 --> 47:31.825
Take a small piece of baguette
to cleanse the palate.

47:33.762 --> 47:38.198
Okay. Please
drink from this glass.

47:46.841 --> 47:49.176
Is it the Miller High Life
or the Guinness stout?

47:50.445 --> 47:51.565
The Miller High Life.

47:53.281 --> 47:55.883
Oh, boy.
What? <i> Merde!</i>

47:55.885 --> 47:57.951
We have a lot of work to do.

47:57.953 --> 47:59.987
I was sure it was
Miller High Life.

47:59.989 --> 48:01.421
Now please take
a buffalo chicken wing

48:01.423 --> 48:03.290
to obliterate the palate.

48:03.292 --> 48:05.459
No, I was not very

48:05.461 --> 48:09.930
like, I had, like,
big glasses for my sight.

48:09.932 --> 48:12.833
And I was not very...
attractive actually.

48:12.835 --> 48:14.334
I find that very hard
to believe.

48:14.336 --> 48:17.137
Yeah?
Yes.

48:17.139 --> 48:20.407
I like it that you
find that very... ha ha ha..

48:20.409 --> 48:22.409
I find that
incredibly difficult..

48:24.212 --> 48:25.846
...to believe.

48:25.848 --> 48:28.015
That was very adventurous.
It was?

48:29.918 --> 48:34.388
Yes, in my culture we wait
a long time, maybe even years

48:34.390 --> 48:38.425
before we do...
something like that.

48:38.427 --> 48:40.561
Well, consider it
a cultural exchange.

48:42.230 --> 48:44.364
Can we do that again?

48:49.571 --> 48:52.139
One day when
you're a famous writer

48:52.141 --> 48:54.141
all these people
will know your name.

48:55.476 --> 48:59.413
I don't think I want
that guy to know my name.

48:59.415 --> 49:00.575
You will have no choice.

49:02.617 --> 49:07.554
Why is it that you're so much
sure of me than I am of myself?

49:07.556 --> 49:08.889
Maybe I've seen the future.

49:20.035 --> 49:21.134
Thanks.

49:22.238 --> 49:23.238
Excuse me.

49:26.608 --> 49:28.075
It's you.

49:28.077 --> 49:30.210
Our nanny has
a respiratory infection.

49:30.212 --> 49:31.511
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

49:31.513 --> 49:33.981
<i>Valery and I
have a state luncheon.</i>

49:33.983 --> 49:38.018
Is that better or worse
than a respiratory infection?

49:38.020 --> 49:41.288
I can't miss it and the
children cannot be left alone.

49:41.290 --> 49:43.624
<i>Pas de probleme.</i>
I have an idea.

49:43.626 --> 49:46.159
I don't care if you're French.

49:46.161 --> 49:48.929
If you're going to live here,
there are certain things

49:48.931 --> 49:51.331
that you're going to
have to know how to do.

49:51.333 --> 49:53.233
And none of them..

49:53.235 --> 49:55.102
...none..

49:55.104 --> 49:56.336
...is more important..

49:58.139 --> 50:00.540
...than hitting a baseball.

50:00.542 --> 50:04.645
<i>Okay? Elodie, keep
your back elbow up.</i>

50:04.647 --> 50:07.414
Keep your eyes on the ball
and above all..

50:07.416 --> 50:09.316
Don't lunge.
Exactly.

50:09.318 --> 50:12.052
<i>Ne lunge pas.</i>
Here we go.

50:12.054 --> 50:15.289
Oh! Oh, no, are you okay?
No, I ain't hurt.

50:15.291 --> 50:17.124
It didn't hurt.
What do we call that?

50:17.126 --> 50:18.959
Chin music.
Exactly.

50:18.961 --> 50:21.228
When it comes for you, you gotta
get out of the way, you know.

50:21.230 --> 50:25.565
Alright. Next pitch.
Do not be afraid of the ball.

50:25.567 --> 50:27.601
If it's coming for your head,
get out of the way.

50:27.603 --> 50:31.038
But otherwise, be afraid
of being afraid of the ball.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.040
That's the American way.
Now, hit me in the nose with it.

50:33.042 --> 50:34.374
Okay? Right in the nose.

50:36.311 --> 50:38.245
Oh! That was great.
Yay! Yay!

50:38.247 --> 50:40.380
That was great!
Come here.

50:40.382 --> 50:42.282
Throw me in the air again.
Yes!

50:42.284 --> 50:44.184
Three more.

50:44.186 --> 50:45.519
Two more.

50:45.521 --> 50:46.954
One.

50:50.291 --> 50:52.292
Brian.
Yes.

50:52.294 --> 50:55.295
I'm so glad that
you're my mother's boyfriend.

50:55.297 --> 50:58.332
Me too. We are very, very
happy to have you in the family.

51:01.536 --> 51:02.636
Thank you.

51:02.638 --> 51:05.005
My turn to bat!
My turn to bat!

51:05.007 --> 51:07.441
Yes. Okay.

51:07.443 --> 51:10.677
Uh, give your sister the... what
do we call the catching gear?

51:10.679 --> 51:12.646
The tools of ignorance.
<i>Exactly.</i>

51:12.648 --> 51:16.249
The tools... of ignorance.

51:16.251 --> 51:19.119
Alright, guys,
are you ready?

51:19.121 --> 51:21.288
What have I missed?

51:21.290 --> 51:24.358
Well, let's see.
Your daughter is Derek Jeter.

51:24.360 --> 51:27.294
And your son is David Ortiz.

51:27.296 --> 51:29.329
I don't know
what you're saying to me.

51:29.331 --> 51:31.365
Never mind.
Just watch this.

51:31.367 --> 51:32.766
<i>Okay.</i>

51:32.768 --> 51:35.202
<i>Don't close that stance.
Very good.</i>

51:35.204 --> 51:37.104
<i>I wanna see
your front hip, okay?</i>

51:37.106 --> 51:39.306
Elodie, how about
some infield chatter?

51:43.411 --> 51:45.078
Oh!

51:45.080 --> 51:46.446
Big Papi!

52:46.108 --> 52:49.810
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

52:49.812 --> 52:52.479
$6000 and they publish
your story.

52:52.481 --> 52:54.281
The story about the dogs.

52:54.283 --> 52:56.116
<i>The story about the dogs.</i>

52:56.118 --> 52:58.585
Which you now regret mocking,
don't you?

52:58.587 --> 53:00.787
No, that just proves that
if you have enough talent

53:00.789 --> 53:03.590
you can write about complete
bullshit and still fool people.

53:03.592 --> 53:05.625
But I'm so proud of you.

53:09.464 --> 53:12.566
You know there's a ceremony.
There's a ceremony?

53:12.568 --> 53:13.568
Will you come?

53:15.169 --> 53:17.604
<i>It won't be between
5 and 7?</i>

53:17.606 --> 53:19.539
No.

53:19.541 --> 53:20.874
Can we break the rules?

53:21.809 --> 53:22.889
<i>We can't break them.</i>

53:24.445 --> 53:25.445
I understand.

53:27.148 --> 53:29.649
So we will just have
to work within them.

53:32.653 --> 53:34.688
What does that mean?

53:34.690 --> 53:36.289
It means that
no force on earth

53:36.291 --> 53:37.824
would keep me away that night.

53:46.701 --> 53:47.821
Your future is starting.

54:12.460 --> 54:16.163
One of the best parts
of my job is reading new writers

54:16.165 --> 54:18.498
and occasionally,
even publishing them.

54:19.868 --> 54:22.903
The fact is, talent happens
when it happens

54:22.905 --> 54:25.505
and you have to be there
when it does.

54:25.507 --> 54:27.274
Tonight, I'm delighted
to introduce

54:27.276 --> 54:29.342
6 extraordinary voices.

54:29.344 --> 54:32.746
New writers
for only a moment longer.

54:32.748 --> 54:35.448
<i>Proceeding then
in that ever-egalitarian thing</i>

54:35.450 --> 54:37.684
<i>called alphabetical order.</i>

54:37.686 --> 54:39.519
<i>In her story,
"Kupchino Station"</i>

54:39.521 --> 54:41.721
<i>Diane Altschuler
brings to life</i>

54:41.723 --> 54:44.457
<i>the Leningrad
of the early 1980s.</i>

54:44.459 --> 54:46.459
<i>A city still bearing
the physical scars</i>

54:46.461 --> 54:47.794
<i>of the Second World War</i>

54:47.796 --> 54:50.497
<i>and now feeling the full
stifling effect</i>

54:50.499 --> 54:53.200
<i>of President Jimmy Carter's
grain embargo.</i>

54:53.202 --> 54:54.734
<i>Elainee, a refusenik</i>

54:54.736 --> 54:57.437
<i>the character is based
on the author's mother</i>

54:57.439 --> 55:00.373
<i>earns a small hourly fee
standing in line</i>

55:00.375 --> 55:02.576
<i>on behalf of
a wealthy neighbor to buy...</i>

55:02.578 --> 55:04.578
I'm not comfortable.

55:04.580 --> 55:06.346
Shh.

55:06.348 --> 55:07.981
It's the husband.
She brings the husband?

55:07.983 --> 55:10.383
Dad, please.
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

55:10.385 --> 55:12.485
But I feel I should
get mad at somebody.

55:12.487 --> 55:15.288
Only I'm not sure who.
We'll discuss it after.

55:15.290 --> 55:17.591
All I'm saying
is that civilization

55:17.593 --> 55:20.794
is organized by couples...
for better or worse.

55:20.796 --> 55:23.530
Frequently worse, I grant you.

55:23.532 --> 55:24.931
<i>But there's a reason for it</i>

55:24.933 --> 55:26.600
which is that
it's not confusing.

55:26.602 --> 55:28.368
I'm begging you.

55:28.370 --> 55:30.270
Are you saying
you disagree with me?

55:30.272 --> 55:33.807
Would you for Christ's sake
watch your son's finest hour?

55:33.809 --> 55:36.643
<i>Brian Bloom's story,
"Run From Becky"</i>

55:36.645 --> 55:38.578
is about a forbidden liaison

55:38.580 --> 55:42.382
between two Westminster
best-in-breeds.

55:42.384 --> 55:44.484
<i>One, a German Shepherd
and the other</i>

55:44.486 --> 55:47.354
<i>a Nova Scotia
Duck Tolling Retriever.</i>

55:49.257 --> 55:51.891
I have been reading
your magazine since my parents

55:51.893 --> 55:54.461
got me a subscription
when I went away to college.

55:54.463 --> 55:56.596
That makes me very proud.
Thank you.

55:56.598 --> 55:59.666
And a copy of the "New
Yorker's View Of The World"

55:59.668 --> 56:01.968
cover hangs in
our guest bathroom.

56:01.970 --> 56:05.572
A lovely tribute and soon your
son's story will hang right beside it.

56:05.574 --> 56:07.741
Oh, no. It's gonna hang
in the living room.

56:07.743 --> 56:09.476
<i>Of course. Of course.</i>

56:09.478 --> 56:11.344
But if he keeps writing
the way he is now

56:11.346 --> 56:12.746
he's gonna fill every wall
in the house.

56:12.748 --> 56:15.348
That's very kind.

56:15.350 --> 56:17.851
You are a very nice man.
<i>Thank you.</i>

56:17.853 --> 56:19.919
I thought
you were gonna be gruffer.

56:19.921 --> 56:21.655
Didn't you think
he'd be gruffer?

56:21.657 --> 56:24.724
I was expecting a real SOB.
Okay, then.

56:24.726 --> 56:27.894
Can I borrow the two of you
for just one moment?

56:27.896 --> 56:30.063
Yes.
Excuse us?

56:30.065 --> 56:31.765
The all-important
schmoozefest.

56:31.767 --> 56:32.899
Go. Do.

56:36.304 --> 56:37.804
Nice save.

56:37.806 --> 56:40.407
So I assume you'll be rescinding
the award now.

56:40.409 --> 56:42.442
What? You think
I don't have parents?

56:42.444 --> 56:45.412
Besides, everything I said
to you was true.

56:45.414 --> 56:47.447
All the winning stories
were terrific

56:47.449 --> 56:49.549
but yours carried with it,
I don't know..

56:49.551 --> 56:51.618
...the tease of greatness.

56:51.620 --> 56:53.987
Make of it what you will.

56:53.989 --> 56:55.855
Thank you.

56:55.857 --> 56:57.097
We'll see each other again.

56:59.760 --> 57:01.528
Golly.
Golly?

57:01.530 --> 57:04.464
You are a person
who says, "Golly?"

57:04.466 --> 57:07.033
It just came out.
First time in my life.

57:08.369 --> 57:10.337
Okay.
Listen, fast and close.

57:11.939 --> 57:12.972
Come here.

57:14.442 --> 57:17.844
Okay. My boss is upstairs
at the reception.

57:17.846 --> 57:19.546
He wants to meet you.

57:19.548 --> 57:22.382
He read your story
or at least, half of it.

57:22.384 --> 57:23.583
He loved it.

57:23.585 --> 57:26.119
He... he said
it was a little episodic

57:26.121 --> 57:28.755
which only means he read it
in several sittings.

57:28.757 --> 57:31.891
He loves your voice. Loves!

57:31.893 --> 57:34.027
He wants you to start a novel.

57:34.029 --> 57:37.497
He wants to publish you.
He... he never says that.

57:37.499 --> 57:39.132
He hates everything.

57:39.134 --> 57:42.068
He just wants to meet you
for one minute first

57:42.070 --> 57:45.004
and make sure that
you're not a lunatic...

57:45.006 --> 57:46.940
What the hell is wrong with you?

57:49.543 --> 57:52.145
She brought Valery.

57:52.147 --> 57:54.481
Of course, she did.
Rules are rules.

57:54.483 --> 57:58.451
So this shouldn't bother me?
It doesn't bother you at all?

57:58.453 --> 58:01.388
To see them here, on a night
like this, in your world...

58:01.390 --> 58:04.591
Okay. Get your head right.

58:04.593 --> 58:07.894
Get your head right right now
because you're about to have

58:07.896 --> 58:10.530
the most important conversation
of your life.

58:10.532 --> 58:12.565
And it's not just
your future here.

58:12.567 --> 58:14.768
It's mine too.
So can you do it?

58:14.770 --> 58:18.905
Can you put the French lady out
of your mind for 9 seconds?

58:18.907 --> 58:21.474
Please.
Just stick out your hand.

58:21.476 --> 58:24.844
Say, "How do you do, sir?"
like a normal human being

58:24.846 --> 58:27.480
so you can have the career
that you have always dreamed of

58:27.482 --> 58:29.783
or are you just gonna blow it
and incinerate

58:29.785 --> 58:33.186
and dissolve like a Kleenex
in a fat man's sneeze?

58:33.188 --> 58:34.988
Is... is your head right?

58:36.857 --> 58:38.591
Is your head right?

58:38.593 --> 58:40.860
Is... your head... right?

58:42.730 --> 58:44.931
You are much crazier
than I am.

58:44.933 --> 58:47.700
Is your head right?
Yes. Yes.

58:47.702 --> 58:49.169
My head is right.
Okay.

58:49.171 --> 58:51.004
Okay.

58:51.006 --> 58:54.007
"How do you do, sir?"
That's all you have to say.

58:54.009 --> 58:56.609
"How do you do, sir?
How do you do, sir?"

58:56.611 --> 58:59.612
"How do you do, sir?
How do you do, sir?"

58:59.614 --> 59:02.749
Brian Bloom, I would like you
to meet Jonathan Galassi.

59:02.751 --> 59:05.151
Our publisher.
How do you do, sir?

59:05.153 --> 59:07.487
Did Jane tell you
to say that?

59:07.489 --> 59:09.155
Yes. She did, sir.

59:09.157 --> 59:12.459
Well... over the coming years

59:12.461 --> 59:14.994
I want you to do
almost everything she says.

59:16.096 --> 59:19.566
I'm pretty sure I already do.

59:19.568 --> 59:22.869
I can't wait to read
what you write when..

59:22.871 --> 59:24.871
...you've got something
to write about.

59:25.873 --> 59:27.474
On that day

59:27.476 --> 59:29.809
I'll be honored
to publish you.

59:29.811 --> 59:31.744
The honor will be all mine.

59:33.881 --> 59:35.248
Uh, that is my happy noise.

59:46.727 --> 59:48.928
I don't mean to meddle,
but you don't stop

59:48.930 --> 59:51.931
being a parent just because
your son's name is in the paper.

59:51.933 --> 59:55.068
I appreciate that, dad.
Sam, he will figure it out.

59:55.070 --> 59:57.003
Can I finish
this conversation?

59:57.005 --> 59:58.538
You have finished it 8 times.

59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.740
In 30 years,
I don't remember once

01:00:00.742 --> 01:00:02.642
ever being able
to finish a sentence.

01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:04.777
Well, with your subjects,
you don't deserve predicate.

01:00:04.779 --> 01:00:06.212
Oh. What is that?

01:00:06.214 --> 01:00:09.816
A grammar insult.
A syntax barb.

01:00:09.818 --> 01:00:14.153
Not everyone is as lucky
as we were, alright?

01:00:14.155 --> 01:00:17.824
Not everyone has it simple.
I know that.

01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:20.627
Do you remember
how sure we were?

01:00:20.629 --> 01:00:23.530
And how quickly
and how little was in our way?

01:00:25.299 --> 01:00:27.734
Do you remember
what you said to me

01:00:27.736 --> 01:00:30.937
after the very fist time
we had intercourse?

01:00:30.939 --> 01:00:32.639
Are you hungry?

01:00:33.941 --> 01:00:35.575
Before that.

01:00:35.577 --> 01:00:37.310
Yes. I remember.

01:00:43.651 --> 01:00:46.252
I should go.
Why are we leaving you here?

01:00:46.254 --> 01:00:48.254
I'd like to walk.
Why?

01:00:48.256 --> 01:00:50.890
There's a lot to think about.
You could get mugged.

01:00:50.892 --> 01:00:53.126
By who?
An exhausted office worker?

01:00:53.128 --> 01:00:54.894
Arlene,
your son is a madman.

01:00:54.896 --> 01:00:58.064
Because he walks?
You should try it.

01:00:58.066 --> 01:00:59.933
I'm really glad
you guys came tonight.

01:00:59.935 --> 01:01:01.601
Thank you.

01:01:01.603 --> 01:01:04.037
Listen to me,
I couldn't be prouder.

01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:06.839
Me too, son.
Honestly.

01:01:06.841 --> 01:01:08.942
We are now officially
spending that law school money.

01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:10.810
Half of it.

01:01:10.812 --> 01:01:14.147
I love you both.
Please drive home safely, okay?

01:01:14.149 --> 01:01:16.349
We'll give you two and half
rings when we reach.

01:01:16.351 --> 01:01:18.351
Alright.

01:01:18.353 --> 01:01:21.888
The GW or the Tappan Zee?

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.823
At this hour?

01:02:05.899 --> 01:02:07.867
Hello.

01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:09.035
<i>I need your help
with jewelry.</i>

01:02:09.037 --> 01:02:10.870
I beg your pardon.

01:02:10.872 --> 01:02:14.273
What jewelry stores
does Arielle respect?

01:02:14.275 --> 01:02:17.076
It's midnight.
<i>Yes.</i>

01:02:17.078 --> 01:02:18.878
Why are you asking me this?

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.981
Because I'm spotty
on women's accessories.

01:02:21.983 --> 01:02:24.684
Why are you
buying her jewelry?

01:02:24.686 --> 01:02:26.953
Do I have to say?

01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:29.389
You're gonna be my writer.
I'm going to be your editor.

01:02:29.391 --> 01:02:31.424
We're going to have
this kind of relationship.

01:02:31.426 --> 01:02:33.226
What kind of relationship?

01:02:33.228 --> 01:02:35.962
The kind where you call me
in the middle of the night

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:39.198
asking me crazy questions
and I talk you off the ledge.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.302
Could you please just tell me
where to shop for her?

01:02:43.304 --> 01:02:45.138
What genre of jewelry?

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.939
There are genres?

01:02:46.941 --> 01:02:48.675
<i>Fun or important?</i>

01:02:50.844 --> 01:02:54.147
Important.
<i>You can't afford important.</i>

01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:57.050
As important as I can afford.

01:02:57.052 --> 01:02:58.918
<i>Give me a dollar figure.</i>

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.354
$6000, including tax.

01:03:08.729 --> 01:03:09.862
Dior.

01:03:14.835 --> 01:03:17.236
Okie-dokie, then.

01:03:17.238 --> 01:03:20.807
<i>I'm gonna get
some sleep now, okay?</i>

01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:22.075
I knew you'd know.

01:03:27.481 --> 01:03:30.349
I wish it were
tomorrow at 5.

01:03:30.351 --> 01:03:32.118
Can you stay
for another moment?

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.721
There's something I wanna say.

01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:36.055
Of course.

01:03:41.462 --> 01:03:43.896
I would like
to be a good writer.

01:03:43.898 --> 01:03:46.098
And tell stories that mean
something to people.

01:03:50.037 --> 01:03:52.839
But the only thing..

01:03:52.841 --> 01:03:56.275
...I really want in this world..

01:03:56.277 --> 01:03:58.511
...is to be the man
who walks beside you.

01:04:01.215 --> 01:04:04.817
You do walk beside me.
Not just from 5 to 7.

01:04:04.819 --> 01:04:07.487
It's not enough.
Not nearly.

01:04:19.867 --> 01:04:22.001
Marry me, Arielle.

01:04:22.003 --> 01:04:23.436
I wanna be your husband.

01:04:23.438 --> 01:04:27.140
And stepfather to your children
and if you wish it

01:04:27.142 --> 01:04:30.042
I want us to have
children together.

01:04:32.179 --> 01:04:35.114
I am already married.
I know.

01:04:35.116 --> 01:04:39.385
And that's why this is not
a conventional engagement ring.

01:04:39.387 --> 01:04:41.954
That and the fact that
a conventional engagement ring

01:04:41.956 --> 01:04:43.556
will require
a somewhat more

01:04:43.558 --> 01:04:45.925
robust conquest
of the marketplace.

01:04:48.295 --> 01:04:51.030
You know the situation.
I do.

01:04:51.032 --> 01:04:52.431
You know the rules.

01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:55.434
I do and I can
no longer play by them.

01:05:00.107 --> 01:05:04.143
We had a trust
that you have now broken.

01:05:04.145 --> 01:05:05.244
I know.

01:05:06.947 --> 01:05:09.015
And I can't help it.

01:05:09.017 --> 01:05:12.185
I've found the person
I wanna spend my life with.

01:05:12.187 --> 01:05:15.321
That is a drive much stronger
than any set of rules

01:05:15.323 --> 01:05:18.858
or any doubts about the meaning
and purpose of marriage.

01:05:21.094 --> 01:05:25.064
Of course, if your... feelings
aren't as strong as mine

01:05:25.066 --> 01:05:28.601
then... I completely understand.

01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:31.604
They are.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.574
You know that they are.

01:05:36.176 --> 01:05:37.944
They are.

01:05:39.379 --> 01:05:41.280
From the first moment.

01:05:52.092 --> 01:05:55.328
You really think you're ready
to be a stepfather?

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:56.996
I know I am.

01:05:59.099 --> 01:06:01.534
You will be growing up
in a very big hurry

01:06:01.536 --> 01:06:03.269
skipping your young adulthood.

01:06:03.271 --> 01:06:06.205
Frankly, it's overrated.

01:06:06.207 --> 01:06:08.507
Regular adulthood
seems much better.

01:06:10.944 --> 01:06:12.178
I'm 9 years
older than you.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.579
I don't care.

01:06:13.581 --> 01:06:16.082
When you're 34,
I will be 43.

01:06:16.084 --> 01:06:19.352
Women are at their
most beautiful in their 40s.

01:06:19.354 --> 01:06:20.553
Okay. That's true.

01:06:20.555 --> 01:06:23.222
But 10 years after
that I'll be 53.

01:06:23.224 --> 01:06:26.325
At which point I will believe that women
are at their most beautiful in their 50s.

01:06:26.327 --> 01:06:29.262
Oh, and 10 years after that?
What are we doing, sums now?

01:06:30.397 --> 01:06:31.597
No.

01:06:38.438 --> 01:06:41.173
Do you believe that keeping
a marriage together

01:06:41.175 --> 01:06:43.242
is always best
for the children?

01:06:46.146 --> 01:06:48.948
If I believed that..

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:51.684
...I wouldn't be asking
you to do this.

01:06:53.587 --> 01:06:56.956
But if you believe it,
then... you have to say no.

01:07:00.928 --> 01:07:02.528
This is complicated.

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:06.032
This is very... very complicated.

01:07:06.034 --> 01:07:08.501
It's not.
I mean, yes, it is.

01:07:08.503 --> 01:07:11.270
Of course, it is,
but at the same time

01:07:11.272 --> 01:07:14.040
it's very simple.

01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:16.409
What are we willing
to do for love?

01:07:45.505 --> 01:07:49.075
How did you know the size?

01:07:49.077 --> 01:07:51.377
I described your hands
to the salesman.

01:08:01.355 --> 01:08:02.989
Are you saying yes?

01:08:24.243 --> 01:08:27.446
Meet me here tomorrow.

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:29.281
I'll bring a suitcase.

01:08:29.283 --> 01:08:31.417
We will live here
for the first little while.

01:08:34.254 --> 01:08:37.723
I will tell Valery tonight.
I will not be able to call you.

01:08:39.225 --> 01:08:40.760
Just..

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:45.497
...be here... tomorrow.

01:08:47.401 --> 01:08:49.568
At 5.

01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:51.703
At 4.
At 4?

01:08:54.474 --> 01:08:56.242
There are no rules anymore.

01:09:43.423 --> 01:09:45.124
Yes?

01:09:45.126 --> 01:09:47.725
It's Valery.
Let me in, please.

01:09:51.598 --> 01:09:53.332
Apartment 3C.

01:10:20.894 --> 01:10:23.462
Please come in.

01:10:23.464 --> 01:10:25.131
Thank you.

01:10:30.637 --> 01:10:33.472
Would you like something?
I have, um...

01:10:42.783 --> 01:10:45.784
We had an understanding.

01:10:45.786 --> 01:10:48.654
A clear, honorable
and tacitly acknowledged

01:10:48.656 --> 01:10:50.656
set of boundaries.

01:10:50.658 --> 01:10:53.225
I know.

01:10:53.227 --> 01:10:56.262
I have welcomed you
into my family

01:10:56.264 --> 01:10:57.897
under a certain aegis

01:10:57.899 --> 01:11:00.166
and now you have betrayed
everyone involved.

01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:02.935
I had no choice.

01:11:06.873 --> 01:11:09.475
Are you certain
you know what you're doing?

01:11:09.477 --> 01:11:12.211
Yes.

01:11:12.213 --> 01:11:13.546
I'm sorry.

01:11:13.548 --> 01:11:15.447
I meant no injury.

01:11:18.285 --> 01:11:20.486
I know.

01:11:20.488 --> 01:11:22.721
I'm sure that if the roles
had been reversed

01:11:22.723 --> 01:11:25.257
I would've done the same.

01:11:31.598 --> 01:11:33.265
See to her.

01:11:57.557 --> 01:11:59.358
Mr. Bloom.

01:12:01.995 --> 01:12:03.896
Yes?

01:12:03.898 --> 01:12:05.798
Madam Pierpont
was here earlier.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.766
She asked me
to give this to you.

01:13:09.663 --> 01:13:12.665
<i>I started working
when I was 11.</i>

01:13:12.667 --> 01:13:15.668
<i>By 25, I could feel the end
of my career coming.</i>

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:18.804
<i>I thought, "What happens now?"</i>

01:13:18.806 --> 01:13:21.307
<i>"What will be my life?"</i>

01:13:21.309 --> 01:13:23.475
<i>I was terrified.</i>

01:13:23.477 --> 01:13:27.579
<i>And so I made
an error of youth.</i>

01:13:27.581 --> 01:13:29.782
<i>Some of the girls were lucky.</i>

01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:34.486
<i>They had fallen in love,
but not me. Not once.</i>

01:13:34.488 --> 01:13:36.555
<i>Even though I had been
all over the world</i>

01:13:36.557 --> 01:13:39.658
<i>and I had met everyone.</i>

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.394
<i>That spring, I was introduced
to Valery.</i>

01:13:42.396 --> 01:13:45.431
<i>He was then just as he is now.</i>

01:13:45.433 --> 01:13:49.635
<i>Solid. Substantial.
And good.</i>

01:13:49.637 --> 01:13:54.406
<i>"The salt of the Earth,"
as American like to say.</i>

01:13:54.408 --> 01:13:57.543
<i>I felt a great affection
for him.</i>

01:13:57.545 --> 01:13:59.478
<i>A great respect.</i>

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.780
<i>That is a kind of love.</i>

01:14:01.782 --> 01:14:05.884
<i>I thought it was the only kind
I would ever know.</i>

01:14:05.886 --> 01:14:07.586
<i>I didn't believe enough.</i>

01:14:08.855 --> 01:14:10.856
<i>I didn't believe in love.</i>

01:14:14.361 --> 01:14:16.428
<i>8 years later</i>

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:18.630
<i>I discovered that
I should have.</i>

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:23.869
<i>It has stunned me,
this new happiness</i>

01:14:23.871 --> 01:14:25.471
<i>which came out of nowhere.</i>

01:14:28.575 --> 01:14:31.043
<i>This secret door
that has opened in me.</i>

01:14:32.812 --> 01:14:35.547
<i>I have never felt so alive..</i>

01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:40.919
<i>...as when I am in your arms.</i>

01:14:40.921 --> 01:14:44.456
<i>It is tempting, so tempting
to forget about everything</i>

01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:47.726
<i>and just accept this gift.</i>

01:14:47.728 --> 01:14:50.963
<i>But I cannot.</i>

01:14:50.965 --> 01:14:52.898
<i>And not because I don't believe</i>

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.402
<i>that you would be a marvelous
stepfather to Marc and Elodie.</i>

01:14:56.404 --> 01:14:58.470
<i>And a wonderful father
to the children</i>

01:14:58.472 --> 01:15:01.673
<i>we might have had together.</i>

01:15:01.675 --> 01:15:05.711
<i>Not because of lifestyle
or the difference in our ages</i>

01:15:05.713 --> 01:15:09.581
<i>or the opinions of others.</i>

01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:12.785
<i>When Valery and I married,
we wrote our own vows.</i>

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.535
<i>He has always kept his promise</i>

01:15:29.537 --> 01:15:33.672
<i>and I feel I must keep mine.</i>

01:15:33.674 --> 01:15:36.742
<i>But it's more
than a matter of honor.</i>

01:15:36.744 --> 01:15:39.878
<i>One day, Brian,
when you have children</i>

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.049
<i>you'll understand that to leave
them is to leave yourself.</i>

01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:47.820
<i>And to injure them,
unthinkable.</i>

01:15:47.822 --> 01:15:52.491
<i>I told you,
I'm an old-fashioned girl.</i>

01:15:52.493 --> 01:15:54.793
<i>Please do not try
to contact me.</i>

01:15:54.795 --> 01:15:57.763
<i>It will not change anything.</i>

01:15:57.765 --> 01:16:01.500
<i>I am so sad to say goodbye.</i>

01:16:01.502 --> 01:16:03.869
<i>To be parted.</i>

01:16:03.871 --> 01:16:07.105
<i>I can't believe it, really.</i>

01:16:07.107 --> 01:16:10.843
<i>We had so many adventures
still ahead of us.</i>

01:16:10.845 --> 01:16:13.846
<i>Maybe... if we had had more time</i>

01:16:13.848 --> 01:16:15.714
<i>I would have found
something about you</i>

01:16:15.716 --> 01:16:19.084
<i>I didn't like,
really couldn't stand</i>

01:16:19.086 --> 01:16:21.987
<i>which would be very useful
right now.</i>

01:16:21.989 --> 01:16:24.656
<i>But I doubt it.</i>

01:16:24.658 --> 01:16:28.560
<i>They say that
no love is perfect.</i>

01:16:28.562 --> 01:16:31.730
<i>But then, they never met you.</i>

01:16:32.765 --> 01:16:34.266
<i>Arielle.</i>

01:17:38.798 --> 01:17:42.034
Let me help.
No, it's okay.

01:17:42.036 --> 01:17:44.636
But if I may impose
for a favor?

01:17:44.638 --> 01:17:46.638
Sir.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.974
Please give this
to Madam Pierpont

01:17:48.976 --> 01:17:51.977
when she comes
for lunch on Friday.

01:17:51.979 --> 01:17:54.012
Certainly, sir.

01:17:54.014 --> 01:17:55.247
Thank you.

01:19:01.014 --> 01:19:03.348
<i>I did as she asked.</i>

01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:05.717
<i>I didn't try to contact her.</i>

01:19:05.719 --> 01:19:08.720
<i>I stayed out of
her neighborhood.</i>

01:19:08.722 --> 01:19:12.257
<i>I never returned
to the St. Regis.</i>

01:19:12.259 --> 01:19:14.993
<i>If my route was
to take me near it</i>

01:19:14.995 --> 01:19:17.829
<i>I would go a couple of blocks
out of my way.</i>

01:20:55.261 --> 01:20:57.095
Yes?

01:20:57.097 --> 01:20:59.865
<i>It's just me. Jane.</i>

01:21:12.278 --> 01:21:14.446
How is she?

01:21:14.448 --> 01:21:16.548
I have no idea.

01:21:18.885 --> 01:21:20.485
What do you mean?

01:21:22.789 --> 01:21:25.357
I ended it with Valery.

01:21:25.359 --> 01:21:26.858
Why?

01:21:28.895 --> 01:21:31.396
Because there is a certain
sadness to it now.

01:21:31.398 --> 01:21:33.999
Because being around him
and around her

01:21:34.001 --> 01:21:37.235
feels like I'm betraying
my friendship with you.

01:21:37.237 --> 01:21:40.539
You're not.
Not anymore.

01:21:40.541 --> 01:21:43.008
And because..

01:21:46.579 --> 01:21:48.580
...the future has a way
of arriving

01:21:48.582 --> 01:21:51.016
whether you want it to or not.

01:21:54.854 --> 01:21:57.189
Eat something.

01:21:57.191 --> 01:21:58.990
Smoke less.

01:22:05.498 --> 01:22:08.133
Call me.
We'll go to the movies.

01:22:08.135 --> 01:22:10.836
Something from
a big American studio.

01:23:13.966 --> 01:23:16.635
<i>As little as you want
to write when you're happy</i>

01:23:16.637 --> 01:23:20.138
<i>that's how much you have to
write when you're miserable.</i>

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.374
<i>Your passions
have to go somewhere</i>

01:23:22.376 --> 01:23:25.510
<i>and this is
the only place left.</i>

01:23:25.512 --> 01:23:27.672
<i>Your suffering has to be
good for something.</i>

01:23:33.486 --> 01:23:36.655
<i>It's not for me to say if
the words were worth the price.</i>

01:23:48.234 --> 01:23:50.001
What are you doing?
Where are we going?

01:23:50.003 --> 01:23:52.070
Just wait a minute.

01:24:24.637 --> 01:24:27.038
Smile, you asshole. Smile.

01:24:39.285 --> 01:24:42.554
Come on. Come on,
we're celebrating.

01:25:43.649 --> 01:25:45.517
<i>Thousands of years ago</i>

01:25:45.519 --> 01:25:49.788
<i>somebody came up with
the notion of impermanence.</i>

01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:53.758
<i>Of the beauty
and inevitability of change.</i>

01:25:55.694 --> 01:25:57.814
<i>I'm pretty sure
they had just been dumped.</i>

01:26:00.232 --> 01:26:04.235
<i>I had a long time to consider
the value of memory.</i>

01:26:04.237 --> 01:26:07.272
<i>And the idea that just because
something doesn't last forever</i>

01:26:07.274 --> 01:26:10.408
<i>doesn't mean
its worth is diminished.</i>

01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:13.611
<i>Maybe it was just
a rationalization.</i>

01:26:13.613 --> 01:26:16.581
<i>Easier on the soul than
mourning what might have been.</i>

01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:18.783
<i>A life unlived.</i>

01:26:18.785 --> 01:26:20.318
<i>I honestly don't know.</i>

01:26:21.821 --> 01:26:23.855
<i>But I chose
to believe in memory.</i>

01:26:23.857 --> 01:26:27.725
<i>I chose to believe in her.</i>

01:26:27.727 --> 01:26:30.628
<i>I chose to believe
that the bond was never broken</i>

01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:32.764
<i>and that we carried each other
in our hearts.</i>

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.267
<i>As a secret singularity.</i>

01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:39.838
<i>She made me a writer.</i>

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.241
<i>She made me a man.</i>

01:26:43.243 --> 01:26:46.411
<i>There would be other loves,
even great loves.</i>

01:26:47.446 --> 01:26:48.580
<i>But she was right.</i>

01:26:50.616 --> 01:26:53.418
<i>Only one remained perfect.</i>

01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:06.798
I'm gonna get a kick
out of that.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.734
Carol tells me that she's

01:27:09.736 --> 01:27:13.171
she's deciding to take
her work vacation.

01:27:13.173 --> 01:27:14.873
<i>Which she has.</i>
Of course she has.

01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:17.842
<i>And as a result,
it never quite left me alone.</i>

01:27:33.559 --> 01:27:36.461
...like, you have to try...

01:27:36.463 --> 01:27:40.165
<i>I wondered if it remained
perfect for her as well.</i>

01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:43.168
<i>Or if I was just
holding onto an idea.</i>

01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:48.673
<i>Some questions
have to go unanswered.</i>

01:27:48.675 --> 01:27:51.676
<i>But in New York, you're never
more than 20 feet away</i>

01:27:51.678 --> 01:27:54.345
<i>from someone you know</i>

01:27:54.347 --> 01:27:56.307
<i>or someone you were
meant to know.</i>

01:28:29.648 --> 01:28:31.168
Hi.
Hi.

01:28:33.719 --> 01:28:35.820
Brian, lovely to see you.
Valery, how are you?

01:28:35.822 --> 01:28:38.256
Nice to see <i> you.</i>
This is Kiva.

01:28:38.258 --> 01:28:39.824
How are you?
Hello, I'm Valery.

01:28:39.826 --> 01:28:41.459
Nice to meet you.
And you.

01:28:41.461 --> 01:28:43.561
Very nice to meet you.
Marc.

01:28:43.563 --> 01:28:46.497
And our children,
Marc and Elodie.

01:28:46.499 --> 01:28:47.899
<i>And?</i>

01:28:49.635 --> 01:28:52.003
This is Charlie Bloom.
Hi, Charlie.

01:28:52.005 --> 01:28:54.505
Wanna say hi, Charlie?
Hello, Charlie.

01:28:54.507 --> 01:28:57.942
He's two, right?
Yeah, he's... he is two.

01:28:57.944 --> 01:29:00.278
<i>Not talking much yet.</i>

01:29:01.747 --> 01:29:03.915
I loved "The Mermaid."

01:29:03.917 --> 01:29:08.019
<i>Oh, yes, so did I. And I must
say, all of your books.</i>

01:29:08.021 --> 01:29:11.389
Yes, we read you religiously
in our home.

01:29:11.391 --> 01:29:13.691
Thank you.
I'm very glad about that.

01:29:15.494 --> 01:29:17.562
Tell me, how... how is Jane?

01:29:17.564 --> 01:29:19.864
Jane is brilliant.

01:29:19.866 --> 01:29:22.734
Jane is Jane.

01:29:22.736 --> 01:29:23.935
She is married.

01:29:23.937 --> 01:29:26.971
She met a very good guy,
a cellist.

01:29:26.973 --> 01:29:29.540
And they have a son.

01:29:29.542 --> 01:29:31.776
<i>Oh, that's wonderful.</i>

01:29:31.778 --> 01:29:34.779
<i>And tell me, Mrs. Bloom,
apart from being the mother</i>

01:29:34.781 --> 01:29:37.649
<i>of this beautiful..</i>

01:30:10.617 --> 01:30:12.383
Brian.

01:30:12.385 --> 01:30:13.618
Take care...
Take care. Bye-bye.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.420
So nice to meet you.

01:30:16.422 --> 01:30:17.755
Bye.

01:30:37.009 --> 01:30:39.811
<i>I don't know
if I'll ever see her again.</i>

01:30:39.813 --> 01:30:41.846
<i>I don't know
if that's a good thing</i>

01:30:41.848 --> 01:30:43.014
<i>or a bad one.</i>

01:30:45.651 --> 01:30:48.486
<i>But I will promise you this.</i>

01:30:48.488 --> 01:30:52.790
<i>Your favorite story,
whatever it might be</i>

01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:55.660
<i>was written for one reader.</i>
