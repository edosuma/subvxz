Oh yes, Mr. Alan, sir.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.867
Now, Parker, remember
what we talked about.

03:38.933 --> 03:41.700
No teaching him any of
the old tricks from your
misspent youth.

It wouldn't be appropriate.

I'll be sticking
to the fundamentals.

04:02.333 --> 04:05.833
Yes, Parker. You know,
that drink we pour out
of pots into cups.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.067
Actually, this could be fun.

04:07.067 --> 04:09.500
So, what kind of fundamentals
are you talking about?

04:09.567 --> 04:12.367
How to fly Fab One? Deploying
the smoke screen canister?

04:12.433 --> 04:15.500
-Oh! The oil slick dispenser?
-Oh, no.

04:15.567 --> 04:18.800
Nobody drives
Fab One except me.

04:18.867 --> 04:22.767
You see, at the
Parker School of Motoring,
Mr. Alan, sir,

04:22.833 --> 04:26.667
all pupils learn
in the same car.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.867
What... Is... That?

04:30.933 --> 04:34.067
This is Fab Zero.

04:34.067 --> 04:37.467
And it's been in the family
since before you were born.

04:37.533 --> 04:40.233
Uh-uh. No way am I
getting into that thing.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.633
It's practically an antique.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.600
What was good enough
for your brothers

04:43.667 --> 04:46.067
is good enough for you,
Mr. Alan, sir.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.633

04:50.567 --> 04:52.133
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.100
Now, then, on to
the fundamentals.

04:55.933 --> 04:58.700
How to open the door.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.533
How to shut the door.

05:07.067 --> 05:09.733
How to doff your cap.

05:13.067 --> 05:17.500
And now the most
fundamental fundamental,

05:17.567 --> 05:19.633
how to address your passenger.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.067
This needs a lot of practice.

before we get down
to business.

here for tea.

show me some bodyguard moves?

a chauffeur, isn't it?

your passenger?

to worry about that now.

in the kitchen?

Can't you go any faster?

12:35.433 --> 12:37.200
Never mind all your
safety stuff.

12:37.267 --> 12:38.667
Lady Penelope's in trouble.

12:38.733 --> 12:42.367
Sorry. I can't.
My arm hurts too much.

12:42.433 --> 12:45.400
Oh, we're so slow!
It's painful.

12:45.467 --> 12:48.133
Oh, I agree with you there.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.067
Right. Well, gentlemen,

12:50.133 --> 12:52.467
as you can see,
there is indeed,

12:52.533 --> 12:54.133
as my great-niece told you,

12:54.200 --> 12:56.133
nothing of value to you here.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.100
So, if I were you,
I would make tracks.

12:59.167 --> 13:02.333
Otherwise my husband,
Lord Creighton-Ward,

13:02.400 --> 13:04.267
will have his people
after you.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.067
People? What people?

13:06.067 --> 13:08.833
We have a number of
security working for us.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.800
Plus our usual staff,

13:10.867 --> 13:13.600
who could be recruited to
help the search, of course.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.933
Not to mention his assistant,
his butler,

13:17.067 --> 13:18.367
-his dog handler...
-So...

13:18.433 --> 13:21.167
Would you say your husband
is a rich man?

13:21.233 --> 13:23.333
-Er, Aunt Sylvia...
-Goodness, yes.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.333
Filthy rich.
Absolutely loaded.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.967
Not really.
They make do, you know.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.567
Don't be absurd, Penelope.

13:29.633 --> 13:32.167
He's the fourth richest
man in Europe.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.767
-Oh!
-Oh, dear.

13:33.833 --> 13:36.700
Bill, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:36.767 --> 13:40.067
I hope not, Terry. As you are
stupider than a bag of rocks.

13:40.067 --> 13:43.067
However, ladies, there's
been a change of plan.

13:43.067 --> 13:45.667
You are coming with us.

13:45.733 --> 13:47.333
TERRY: That's not
what I was thinking.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.700
(DOG YELPING)

14:12.667 --> 14:15.967
-They've been robbed.
-BILL: Right, in the car.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.700
It's worse than that,
Mr. Alan, sir.

14:20.433 --> 14:22.733
Where's the key bit?
How do you start it?

14:22.800 --> 14:25.967
Oh, I'm so sorry. You really
need to speak to Parker.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.767
Where can he be?

14:27.833 --> 14:29.100
Oh, this is a dumb idea,

14:29.167 --> 14:31.133
Mr. Cleverer
Than a Bag of Rocks Man.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.067
Well, how else are we
gonna get away with 'em?

14:33.133 --> 14:35.067
I didn't bring a spare
people carrier.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.833
Well, it was your idea
to change the plan

14:36.900 --> 14:38.567
and not just get the treasure!

14:38.633 --> 14:41.100
Valuables!
And there weren't any!

14:41.167 --> 14:42.700
That's why we are
taking them...

14:42.767 --> 14:45.700
-PARKER: Oi, you!
-No, push that.

14:45.767 --> 14:47.100
-(HORN HONKING)
-I am.

14:47.167 --> 14:48.800
No one steals Fab One.

14:48.867 --> 14:51.667
Now you'll realize,
you burglar chappies,

14:51.733 --> 14:52.800
that you've met your...

Oh dear, Mr. Alan, sir,

15:01.967 --> 15:04.300
that's done my arm in again.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.967
-I'm in no shape for a chase.
-You mean...

15:07.067 --> 15:09.233
You'll have to take the wheel.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.633
F-A-B, Parker.

15:11.700 --> 15:15.233
Stay on his tail.
Don't let him get away.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.067
Can't you go any faster?

15:17.067 --> 15:18.933
I still can't figure
this thing out.

15:19.067 --> 15:21.067
I say... Bill, is it?

15:21.067 --> 15:24.267
-Bill? Or are you Terry?
-It's Bill... M'lady.

15:24.333 --> 15:27.200
-Here, why'd you say that?
-I dunno. Just felt right.

15:27.267 --> 15:30.533
Right, Bill, do you actually
know how to drive?

15:30.600 --> 15:33.067
Of course I don't know
how to drive.

15:33.067 --> 15:37.300
It's 2060. Nobody drives
anymore... M'lady.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.367
Parker does.
Although something seems

15:39.433 --> 15:41.300
to be not quite right
there either.

-Well, that's good news.
-No, that's terrible news.

15:51.433 --> 15:55.733
Fab One in the wrong hands
is a very dangerous thing.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.067
Press that one.

15:58.133 --> 16:00.367
Whoa, that slowed them down.

16:00.433 --> 16:01.733
What does this do?

Whoa!

16:03.967 --> 16:05.067

16:05.133 --> 16:06.667
Now that we've got them
in the car,

16:06.733 --> 16:09.300
it would be a good time
for the tea, don't you think?

16:09.367 --> 16:12.567
Aunt Sylvia, I hardly think
this is the time for tea.

16:12.633 --> 16:14.300
Whatever you think.

and smash into them?

16:16.233 --> 16:19.233
No! Absolutely not!

16:19.300 --> 16:20.867
Okay, I could jump out,

16:20.933 --> 16:22.333
run the car down,
open the door

16:22.400 --> 16:24.333
and wrestle the kidnappers
to the ground.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.633
Not if the outer skin
has been electrified.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.233
It can do that? Cool!

We'll just have to
cut them off. Speed up!

-I'm trying. I'm trying!

Now?

16:46.767 --> 16:48.233

-Of course.

Okay, here's the plan.

Keep following them

-Really cool.

Oh yes, them, too.

Which button is it, Parker?

17:12.367 --> 17:14.533
Just under the

17:14.600 --> 17:16.300
I may have just learned
how to drive,
