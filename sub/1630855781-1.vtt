Oh! Oh...

03:09.360 --> 03:10.480
Morning.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.480
- Morning, darling.
- Hello, Joy.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.799
You are making a noise this morning.

03:14.799 --> 03:16.399
Hello, hello. What's up?

03:16.399 --> 03:18.600
Bwaaaaah!

03:18.600 --> 03:20.080
Yes, you are.

03:20.760 --> 03:21.880
Waaaah!

03:21.880 --> 03:23.560
Come on. Oh, what's the matter?

03:23.560 --> 03:24.880
Hey, Mum.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.799
- You all right?
- I forgot why I opened the fridge.

03:28.799 --> 03:33.239
You're... dressed.
You going somewhere today?

03:34.679 --> 03:37.679
I didn't tell you?
I've got a job interview.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.720
It's to host a new radio show about sex.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.359
Well, do you think it's a good idea?

03:44.359 --> 03:46.480
- To be going back to work?
- Oh...

03:46.480 --> 03:48.920
Oh, it's just cabbage leaves.
It's all right.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.920
I, uh...

03:50.840 --> 03:52.320
I've got a blocked duct.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.440
- They help.
- Okay, well...

03:53.440 --> 03:55.399
I just think it might be a bit soon.

03:55.399 --> 03:58.200
I had a baby, darling. Not a lobotomy.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.399
- ...
- My agent thinks it's a good opportunity.

04:01.399 --> 04:02.320
Coffee.

04:03.079 --> 04:04.160
Right.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.600
Oh, bollocks.

04:07.519 --> 04:11.320
Do you mind popping to the shop with Joy
while I'm gone and picking some up?

04:11.320 --> 04:14.480
Maybe some... wet wipes,
and... I'll send you a list.

04:14.480 --> 04:18.200
Well, actually, Mum, it's my first day
at the new school, remember?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.560
- What, today?
- Uh-huh.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.400
- I totally forgot.
- Yeah, I should get going.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.240
But if you need me to stay...

04:24.240 --> 04:26.320
No, we'll be fine. Don't be silly.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.479
We'll be fine! I'm fine!

04:28.479 --> 04:29.800
We'll be fine.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.840
- Bye.
- Bye. Don't worry.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.000
Fuck!

04:39.760 --> 04:42.000
- Morning.
- Good morning.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.039
Wow, that's a new one.

04:44.760 --> 04:49.760
- You look amazing.
- Thank you... look tired.

04:51.039 --> 04:52.680
What were you up all night doin'?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.200
Hey. Heeeey!

04:55.200 --> 04:56.520
- Uh-huh!
- Uh-huh!

04:56.520 --> 04:59.039
- Uh-huh!
- Uh-heeeey!

04:59.039 --> 05:00.479
Very profesh.

05:00.479 --> 05:02.919
- So it's my new free...
- Uh-huh.

05:02.919 --> 05:05.360
...totally transparent sex therapy clinic.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.000
- Ah!
- You were right.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.560
I don't wanna give up helping people.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.080
And I know it sounds silly,
but I think therapy is my calling.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.599
Oh-ho-ho!

05:13.599 --> 05:15.880
- Oh, I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks, man.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.720
Aww! Come on.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.440
- I am shitting myself.
- Why?

05:20.440 --> 05:22.880
Well, what if people think
that we're losers again?

05:22.880 --> 05:23.960
We're not.

05:23.960 --> 05:28.359
We're literally different people now.
We're confident. We know who we are.

05:28.359 --> 05:29.840
- Mmm.
- We're the cool guys.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.120
Mmm.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.640
Oh.

05:40.479 --> 05:42.960
<i>This is my voice
six months on testosterone.</i>

05:43.680 --> 05:47.760
List of pros. My eyebrows are bushier.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.520
I have some facial hair coming in,
which feels amazing.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.000
<i>Shoulders getting broader.</i>

05:54.000 --> 05:57.320
Cons. Still sweating a lot
and have some dry skin patches.

05:57.320 --> 06:02.160
My sex drive is out of control.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.000

06:05.000 --> 06:07.280

06:24.680 --> 06:25.960

06:26.680 --> 06:28.160
Ooh!

06:36.479 --> 06:37.560
Aah!

06:38.280 --> 06:39.440
We might...

06:40.560 --> 06:42.240
need to start gettin'...

06:42.919 --> 06:44.160
the bus.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.560
So I was texting Maeve.

06:50.799 --> 06:53.120
- She sent me a nude.
- What?

06:53.120 --> 06:55.680
Oatcake! Oh my God! That's huge!

06:55.680 --> 06:57.799
- I haven't responded yet.
- Are you mad?

06:57.799 --> 07:00.200
- Stop yelling!
- No! You have to send one back.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.640
- There's sexting etiquette!
- Yeah--

07:01.640 --> 07:04.359
- You can't leave her hanging.
- Okay! I know! I know! I've...

07:04.359 --> 07:05.799
I took a load of pictures.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.520
And I just didn't send any. I hated them.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.760
- I don't like nudes. I... I feel anxious...
- Oh my God. I don't get it.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.000
I send dick pics all the time.
No big deal.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.440
Who are you sending them to?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.599
Oh, I've been on a couple of dating apps!

07:17.599 --> 07:20.520
But all the hot, interesting people
live so far away.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.120
But there's this gay night
at the Labour Club.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.680
- You wanna come? Be my wingman?
- Sure.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.440
- Yay!
- Yeah, I will come.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.760
But what should I wear?

07:29.760 --> 07:32.159
Um, preferably something
without baby sick.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.039
Do I have b-- Ugh!
Why didn't you say anything?

07:36.039 --> 07:37.960
- Because it's very funny.
- No, it's not!

07:37.960 --> 07:39.919
It's dripping down my back!

07:45.000 --> 07:47.039
- Wow!
- Wow!

07:47.880 --> 07:50.039
Oh my God!

07:50.599 --> 07:52.520
- Hmm!
- Aha!

07:52.520 --> 07:53.799
- Hah!
- A-hey!

07:53.799 --> 07:54.719
Heh!

07:54.719 --> 07:57.479
- It's like Amsterdam.
- But in space.

07:58.039 --> 07:59.359
And everyone seems happy.

07:59.359 --> 08:00.719
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.880
And queer.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.200
No stopping in the bike lane.

08:08.359 --> 08:09.400
Super queer.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.280
- "No stopping in the bike lane."
- "Wah wah wah!"

08:14.080 --> 08:15.080
Come on!

08:15.080 --> 08:16.479
- Oh my God, Aimee!
- Hey!

08:16.479 --> 08:18.080
Hiya, crumpets.

08:19.159 --> 08:21.320
- I haven't seen you in...
- Oh my gosh!

08:24.320 --> 08:25.880
This is a no-car zone.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.439
- Where am I supposed to park, then?
- There's a car park across the road.

08:36.679 --> 08:37.760
Um...

08:39.000 --> 08:41.159
- Uh, she was rude.
- Yes!

08:41.679 --> 08:42.679
Are you okay?

08:43.240 --> 08:45.000
- Yes. Yeah.
- Yeah?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.240
I mean, thank you for saving my life!

08:47.240 --> 08:48.680
- I'll see you around.
- Bye.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.079
Well. Ruby's back.

08:52.079 --> 08:53.440
Aah.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.240
I wonder where Anwar and Olivia are.
They usually move as a pack.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.600
I think they went
to Taylor's Secondary in Northbury.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.800
Oh.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.800
- Don't you usually have a car?
- Yeah, I do.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.400
I let a family of squirrels live in it,
and now it's having loads of repairs.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.360
Shall we?

09:09.360 --> 09:10.800
The time has come.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.040
- Come on, Eric.
- I know.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.920
- Gonna be late.
- I'm coming.

09:18.839 --> 09:21.040
- Whoo!
- Well, this is different.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.360
Oh my God! Is that a slide?

09:25.480 --> 09:26.320
Wow!

09:27.199 --> 09:28.280
This is kind of cool.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.839
- Apparently, it's all student-led.
- Yes!

09:31.839 --> 09:33.120
Look at that!

09:34.040 --> 09:35.680
- Right. I could say that...
- Yeah.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.040
Have you played before?

09:39.040 --> 09:42.320
My God. And all the gays, everywhere.

09:42.839 --> 09:46.640
Starting a new school in the middle
of the year is statistically very bad.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.920
That's why me and Eugene
called things off.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.520
We need to focus
and stay serious about the future.

09:53.199 --> 09:56.160
Can I have all the Moordale students
over here, please?

09:58.680 --> 10:01.160
- Okay. Hello, everyone.
- Car park's miles away.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.199
- Can't do that every day. Not in heels.
- Sh, sh. Don't interrupt the Coven.

10:04.199 --> 10:07.160
Hello. Welcome to Cavendish College.
My name is Abbi.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.640
This is Aisha and my boyfriend, Roman.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.240
And we're your sixth form reps.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.079
We have got some tablets
to hand out to you all.

10:14.079 --> 10:15.839
Ooh, that's a bit fancy.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.959
You will find your schedule, uh,
on our social media platform, Dolly.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.800
It doesn't look like I'm in the top sets.
How do you rank your students?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.120
We don't.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.480
We believe if one person does well,
then we all do well.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.280
- Aww!
- We have mock exams.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.400
That makes zero sense.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.160
- Why don't we talk about it later?
- But it doesn't make sense.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.160
Anyway, grab your Cavendish tote bags
and your reusable water bottles.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.720
Then I'll take you on a little tour.
Follow me!

10:48.400 --> 10:51.839
There's daily meditation, silent discos,

10:51.839 --> 10:54.400
sound baths, and yoga on offer

10:54.400 --> 10:57.719
'cause we believe
your mental health matters.

10:57.719 --> 11:00.120
Oh, and Cavendish
is a gossip-free zone.

11:00.120 --> 11:03.560
Talking behind each other's backs
is not a healthy learning environment.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.800
We encourage students

11:05.800 --> 11:10.959
to help with cleaning, gardening,
and community fundraising.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.360
Our motto is, "Why be mean
when you could be green?"

11:17.400 --> 11:19.480
Christ.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.760
Our facilities
are obviously gender-neutral.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.600
We just want everyone
to feel comfortable in themselves.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.760
Awake, and see that people are sleeping.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.880
It's time to bang your drum

11:31.880 --> 11:34.079
and make them open their eyes.

11:34.079 --> 11:37.920
Speakers' Corner is here for students
to express themselves freely at any time.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.880
Your voice matters to Cavendish,
and we wanna hear from you.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.400
Does anyone have any questions?

11:42.400 --> 11:46.680
Hi. Yeah. Um, I want to set up a service
on campus. Who should I speak with?

11:47.440 --> 11:50.600
No one. I suggest booking a room
and making it happen.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.160
- I'm Otis.
- And I'm Eric.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.520
I'm doing
a free sex therapy service on campus.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.079
- Free sex therapy today.
- Lunchtime. Please pop down.

11:58.079 --> 11:59.920
- Free sex therapy.
- One for you...

11:59.920 --> 12:03.280
- Complete confidentiality. No?
- Just keep it. Just keep it.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.560
Erectile dysfunction? No?

12:06.360 --> 12:09.680
- This guy is the walking <i>Kama Sutra.</i>
- Hello.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.640
If you have discharge, vaginismus...

12:12.640 --> 12:17.280
Oh, look. It's my favorite person.
And the sparkly Pied Piper.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.959
- Aww!
- What are you doing here, Isaac?

12:18.959 --> 12:21.440
I started last term.
Finishing my A-levels.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.719
You should check out Otis's clinic.

12:23.719 --> 12:26.520
It's completely free. On the first floor.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.920
With all due respect,
I won't be talking to you about my penis.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.520
- Fine.
- The school's paperless, by the way.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.120
Sh...

12:35.400 --> 12:36.760
- No! No, no, no!
- Yes! Yes!

12:36.760 --> 12:38.680
That's my whole promotional plan!

12:38.680 --> 12:41.120
Otis, we cannot be seen as tree killers.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.360
Please remember to recycle.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.400
- Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so--
- No worries. No worries.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.040
Do you need help settin' up
at your clinic today?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.320
No, I should be fine.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.959
They prefer it sort of one-on-one.

12:53.959 --> 12:55.320
- Keeps it anonymous.
- Mmm.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.240
- You gonna be okay on your own?
- Yeah! Yeah, course.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.320
- I'll see you later. Mmm!
- Cool.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.719
Oh, remember to reply to Maeve.
It'll be awkward if you don't.

13:04.719 --> 13:06.760
- I know.
- Just send her your dick.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.640
- Shut up.
- Just send it. Root to tip.

13:09.640 --> 13:10.880
- Get in the toilet.
- Shut up.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.760
- Have a little rub. Okay?
- Eric!

13:29.440 --> 13:31.160
Oh God! Sorry.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.240
Oh, for fuck's sake!

13:41.240 --> 13:43.520
- That didn't sound good. Are we stuck?
- Yep.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.120
They've got enough money
for a meditation room,

13:47.120 --> 13:49.880
but not for a lift that works.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.240
I've complained so many times.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.640
You don't remember me, do you?

14:02.839 --> 14:03.719
Isaac.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.160
Maeve's sort of ex.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.480
Isaac!

14:07.480 --> 14:09.160
Oh!

14:09.160 --> 14:11.599
Sorry. I'm good with names, not faces.

14:11.599 --> 14:13.599
- What class are you off to?
- Art.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.160
- Same.
- I switched from history.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.280
I've never done art,
but I'm reading this book

14:18.280 --> 14:22.560
that says art can help process trauma,
and I'm on a healing journey, so...

14:25.319 --> 14:27.880
Oh, is that why you do art?

14:27.880 --> 14:30.439
To process trauma?
'Cause you're disabled.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.360
Yes, I'm looking to find catharsis

14:34.360 --> 14:37.520
from the daily emotional torture
of being in a wheelchair

14:37.520 --> 14:40.959
through the magical outlet of painting.

14:40.959 --> 14:41.880
Really?

14:42.520 --> 14:43.520
So, it helps?

14:43.520 --> 14:45.719
I don't need anything to help,

14:45.719 --> 14:47.760
because I'm actually
very happy with my life.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.800
I do art because I like painting.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.120
But thank you very much
for your ableist projection.

14:55.319 --> 14:58.280
Did I just say the wrong thing?

15:02.079 --> 15:04.319
Kind of wish I'd taken the stairs.

15:05.479 --> 15:06.560
Me too.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.800
- Yeah.
- Colorful.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

15:18.599 --> 15:20.560
Headmaster Groff!

15:21.079 --> 15:22.040
Sor... Um...

15:22.680 --> 15:23.640
You just...

15:25.199 --> 15:26.560
uh... scared me.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.680
"Mr. Groff" is fine.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.280
I'm substitute teaching now.
It's my first day.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.240
Oh.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.280
Did Adam start today as well?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.439
I don't know.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.160
Um, we're...
we're not really friends anymore.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.680
Right.

15:43.319 --> 15:44.240
Very good.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.640
I'm still debating...

15:45.640 --> 15:47.319
- Oh yeah.
- I really want...

15:47.319 --> 15:48.719
- Uh, do you want...
- Uh... just...

15:48.719 --> 15:49.880
- Take a...
- Seat.

15:49.880 --> 15:50.959
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, yeah.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.680
All right, maybe, maybe.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.680
Hi.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.640
Hey.

16:03.839 --> 16:06.760
Let's take the register...

16:06.760 --> 16:08.400
We sign in with Dolly, sir.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.120
Is that the school receptionist?

16:10.120 --> 16:11.400
No, it's this...

16:14.160 --> 16:16.280
Um... Mmm. Uh...

16:19.839 --> 16:22.319
I assume you're all familiar with algebra.

16:22.319 --> 16:24.199
- And algebraic equations--
- Sir.

16:24.199 --> 16:25.839
- Huh?
- It's a projector screen.

16:27.839 --> 16:29.319
Ohh...

16:29.319 --> 16:30.920
Ahem.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.959
So, um, you will need to be able to expand

16:35.959 --> 16:38.680
productions of algebraic expressions

16:38.680 --> 16:41.439
and factorize quadratic expressions.

16:41.439 --> 16:44.040
Excuse me, sir. My tablet isn't working.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.680
Can we just wait a second?
I really don't wanna get behind.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.719
Um, I'll take notes for you.

16:50.439 --> 16:51.319
Thanks.

16:51.959 --> 16:53.079
It's fine.

16:53.079 --> 16:57.560
So I thought it would be a good idea to do
a refresher on completing the square.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.159
Like, I am a huge fan.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.760
He's a visionary.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.319
I just can't believe
he wrote this when he was 25.

17:19.319 --> 17:20.599
He's a mad genius.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.880
I heard his last intern
got selected for the Growcott Prize.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.919
- What intern?
- Oh, Maeve. You're so naive sometimes.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.840
Every year he chooses someone
to be his intern.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.840
He mentors them,
and they almost always get published.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.960
We all know Tyrone's gonna get it.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.960
Hey, what about me?

17:39.440 --> 17:40.280
<i>So...</i>

17:41.840 --> 17:43.880
How many of you wanna be writers?

17:46.080 --> 17:49.480
How many of you are thinking about
writing your novel already?

17:50.919 --> 17:54.240
Okay. So here are some home truths.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.919
Only a handful of you
will be talented enough to write well,

17:57.919 --> 18:01.480
and even fewer of you will write anything
that will earn you any money.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.240
Sorry, sir.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.600
In future, if you are late to this class,
you will not be let in.

18:08.600 --> 18:12.600
I think they had you read my book,
<i>Blood on a Rainbow Maze.</i>

18:14.399 --> 18:15.240
Any thoughts?

18:17.800 --> 18:19.640
I think it's your masterpiece.

18:19.640 --> 18:24.240
It's so vibrant, an incendiary allegory
for unregulated capitalism.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.320
Do you disagree?

18:31.480 --> 18:33.520
No. No, I liked it.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.320
I, uh... I preferred your first novel,
<i>Night Tales.</i>

18:38.000 --> 18:40.760
I thought the relationship
between the mother and the son was

18:40.760 --> 18:42.560
really complicated and quite moving.

18:43.840 --> 18:44.679
Hmm.

18:45.800 --> 18:49.080
Not many people have read that book.
And you're right.

18:49.080 --> 18:52.720
<i>Rainbow Maze</i> is a pile of shit compared.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.679
Although the critics seem to like it.

18:54.679 --> 18:55.960
But with <i>Night Tales,</i>

18:55.960 --> 18:59.000
it was actually
quite a painful experience to write,

18:59.000 --> 19:03.280
but I believe that writing
is supposed to cost us something.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.320
So as you begin to explore
your ideas for these novels in my class,

19:08.320 --> 19:11.560
I want to remind you
that this will not be easy.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.919
We'll be reading your first chapters
in the next class.

19:15.919 --> 19:17.760
Okay, let's move on.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.320
What do we mean when we talk... Ahem.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.800
- Sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.919
Can I see that for a sec?

19:30.919 --> 19:32.480
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.159
Now, where was I?

19:43.880 --> 19:45.159
Great eyes.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.200
- Lovely detail.
- Thanks.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.440
I love the way
you're playing with form and light.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.560
That's very nice.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.560
Oh, that's interesting.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.480
What is it?

20:00.120 --> 20:00.960
It's boobs.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.280
So it is.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.440
Remember, you don't have
to be so... literal.

20:09.760 --> 20:10.600
Oh.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.080
- That's good.
- Thanks, miss.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.880
Very sensual.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.480
Right there.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.280
Lovely texture.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.880
Ooh, I like that.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.320
Keep going. Yes! Yes!

20:36.200 --> 20:37.280
May I be excused?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.679
What's wrong with you? Oh fuck.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.080
- Hello.
- <i>Hello, Maureen. Hi.</i>

21:10.080 --> 21:11.760
Uh, I know it's a long shot,

21:11.760 --> 21:14.800
but you wouldn't be able
to take Joy for a couple of hours?

21:14.800 --> 21:16.760
<i>- Would you?</i>
- Oh, Jean, I'd love to,

21:16.760 --> 21:18.880
but I've got my self-defense class,

21:18.880 --> 21:21.240
and I'm getting a belt today, so...

21:21.240 --> 21:25.600
<i>- Any other time, I'd be there in a flash.</i>
- All right, well, um, thanks anyway.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.520
<i>It was short notice.</i>

21:26.520 --> 21:27.800
<i>- </i>  Is everything all right?
<i>- Yeah!</i>

21:27.800 --> 21:30.480
Yeah. No, I'm fine. It's all good.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.560
Okay, thanks. I'd better run. Bye.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.440
Oh, okay. Bye.

21:37.560 --> 21:41.640
I picked up these
from the Jobcentre for you.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.840
Adam, I respect your decision
to not go back to school.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.520
It isn't for everyone.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.520
But you can't
sit around all day eating cereal

21:48.520 --> 21:50.840
and looking at pictures
of your ex-boyfriend.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.600
Hi, sir. I'm so sorry about my phone.
It won't happen again, promise.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.240
- Maeve Wiley, right?
- Yeah.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.399
I heard your application was impressive.
Look forward to reading your chapter.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.000
- He knew about your application.
- He also threw my phone out.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.120
- Who was calling you, anyway?
- My mum.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.240
Oh, nice that she checks up on you.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.800
- Are you close?
- Not really, no.

22:41.399 --> 22:44.000
- She's a drug addict.
- Your mum is a drug addict?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.080
Yeah.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.520
Well, you're gonna have so much cool stuff
to write about for this class.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.439
I don't think you can say that.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.320
I don't think I agree with the whole
"writing should cost you something."

22:54.320 --> 22:56.560
Feel like stories can just be stories.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.159
I found it.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.080
Hypothetically speaking,
if you'd sent an intimate picture

23:06.080 --> 23:07.880
to the person you're kind of dating,

23:07.880 --> 23:09.840
and they hadn't replied,
what would you do?

23:09.840 --> 23:10.840
Dump him.

23:11.919 --> 23:14.000
I can't.
He's not technically my boyfriend.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.200
Ghost him, then.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.919
But what if he's ghosting her?

23:23.240 --> 23:24.760
Okay.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.360
The thing is,
our ratings are going down.

24:12.360 --> 24:16.080
Nothing dramatic. It's just everyone's
listening to "podcasts" these days.

24:16.080 --> 24:20.919
So we really need this show
to be a little on the spicier side,

24:20.919 --> 24:23.439
um, you know, to hook in new listeners.

24:23.439 --> 24:27.399
So, do you have any ideas?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.960
Well, yes.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.480
My sessions with my clients
can be really quite dramatic,

24:34.480 --> 24:38.919
so I was thinking that we could recreate
that one-on-one atmosphere,

24:38.919 --> 24:40.280
but live on air.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.399
- Katie! What? Why? You okay?
- Oh.

24:42.399 --> 24:45.640
She-- she asked me to watch her kid,
but now it won't stop crying.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.320
Sorry. I couldn't find childcare.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.480
Oh, no worries.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.439
So, is it just gonna be
a basic call-in show?

24:52.439 --> 24:55.240
Uh, no, no, no.
Not... not basic at all, actually.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.919
Uh it could be really unfiltered, raw,

24:58.919 --> 25:01.040
and, well, potentially...

25:01.040 --> 25:01.960
Oh, sorry.

25:01.960 --> 25:06.679
- Do you wanna do this another time?
- No. No, this is perfect. Perfect timing.

25:06.679 --> 25:09.320
Actually, what I was trying to say is, uh...

25:09.320 --> 25:10.520
There you go.

25:10.520 --> 25:13.399
What I was trying to say is that, um...

25:13.399 --> 25:16.679
you know, listening
to real people's sexual problems

25:16.679 --> 25:19.600
can be quite, you know, quite exciting.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.120
Wildly exciting.

25:21.120 --> 25:25.360
And it can even demystify
the listeners' own relationships.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.840
And that's something
I'm quite committed to in my... in my work.

25:33.439 --> 25:35.199
- I love it.
- Oh.

25:35.199 --> 25:38.960
Yeah! Look, I loved your book.
I... I dig your vibe.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.439
Um... Can you start this week?

25:43.080 --> 25:45.120
Um... Sorry.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.560
Um, I didn't know
that it would be so quick.

25:47.560 --> 25:52.439
See, Joy is only eight weeks old, and...
Do you think you could give me more time?

25:52.439 --> 25:55.480
No. We have to fill the slot.
This is a now thing.

25:55.480 --> 25:59.199
- We can keep you in mind for another time.
- No. I can start immediately.

25:59.199 --> 26:01.199
Great! What a rollercoaster.

26:01.199 --> 26:03.399
- Great.
- It's great.

26:04.199 --> 26:05.560
Thank you.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.600
Fantastic.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.240
Abbi said she liked my trousers.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.000
I heard the Coven say
that corduroy is in now.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.280
- ...probably orange.
- Good idea.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.840
What do you reckon?

26:26.840 --> 26:29.679
Actually, I think
I'll go for ginger this time.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.439
You know, I do love...

26:31.439 --> 26:35.320
"I am here. I am enough.
I am learning to be a better person."

26:36.439 --> 26:37.320
Hmm.

26:41.679 --> 26:43.919
- Honestly, do we not... Hello!
- Hey!

26:43.919 --> 26:45.800
- How are you today?
- Hungry!

26:45.800 --> 26:48.520
Have you had a good...
Oh, you're so gorgeous, babe.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.880
- Yeah. Uh...
- Yes?

26:51.600 --> 26:53.600
- No, I'm fine. Yeah.
- Okay.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.560
- Thanks. Yeah.
- No worries. What can I get you?

26:56.560 --> 26:58.600
Mmm...
I'll have the burger, please.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.000
I like lentils,
but they give me really runny poos.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.399
Every day!

27:13.760 --> 27:18.720
This is a bit... awkward,
but this is Abbi's favorite seat.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.919
She loves the view.

27:19.919 --> 27:22.199
Oh, well, I'm fine here, thanks.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.320
I told her this is your seat.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.040
Don't be silly. It's fine.
We'll sit somewhere else today.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.320
I mean, I could move.

27:31.040 --> 27:35.199
Or I could just stay sitting here
and hang out with you guys.

27:35.199 --> 27:38.840
Hey, you're the girl with the car.
Have you considered getting a bike?

27:38.840 --> 27:40.199
- It's so much greener.
- Yeah.

27:40.199 --> 27:41.520
I'll think about it.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.480
I love your coat. Where did you get it?

27:44.480 --> 27:46.080
Thank you. I actually made it.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.679
Anyway, enjoy your lunch and the view.

28:48.439 --> 28:50.800
This guy literally saved my life earlier.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.679
- You're such a little hero.
- Aww!

28:53.679 --> 28:56.000
It was... nothing!

28:56.000 --> 28:58.320
- How are you finding Cavendish so far?
- Um...

28:58.320 --> 29:00.439
It's really different,
but it's very friendly.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.560
Were people not friendly
at your old school?

29:06.120 --> 29:08.520
Oh, no. No, no, no, no,
they... they weren't.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.480
Well, that's sad.

29:09.480 --> 29:12.280
It takes so much more energy
to be negative than positive.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.360
- Mmm!
- What is your star sign?

29:14.360 --> 29:16.959
Oh, um, I'm a Virgo.

29:16.959 --> 29:19.280
When were you born, and at what time?

29:19.280 --> 29:23.360
Oh my God, yes. You have to get Aisha
to do your full chart. She is incredible.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.639
Wh... Oh! Um...

29:25.639 --> 29:28.600
Oh, I don't know.
I'm gonna have to ask my mum.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.040
Sorry, what... what was that?

29:30.040 --> 29:32.320
- Aisha needs to see your lips.
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.800
- Sorry.
- Don't worry. It's fine.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.760
I said I'll have to ask my mum.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.560
- Let me know.
- I will do.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.560
Hi.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.000
Hey.

29:41.000 --> 29:41.959
Hi.

29:44.439 --> 29:46.840
OMG! I forgot to tell you guys.

29:46.840 --> 29:50.840
I found out that Ms. Masters is on Tinder.

29:50.840 --> 29:54.040
I bet you she is a Libra.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.679
Oh!

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
Remember, Aisha, no gossiping.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.639
We're gonna donate the money to charity.

30:02.639 --> 30:05.159
I mean, absolutely. I hate gossipin'.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.399
Where's your friend,
the guy you were with earlier?

30:08.399 --> 30:09.679
Okay, uh...

30:09.679 --> 30:11.639
Um, he...

30:11.639 --> 30:14.959
...is setting up
a sex therapy clinic on campus.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.600
No, I know it sounds very weird,
but, like,

30:19.399 --> 30:21.600
he has just got a gift for giving advice.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.959
And he knows about O, right?

30:26.639 --> 30:27.639
"O"?

30:29.840 --> 30:32.280
Ooh, hi. Hi. Welcome.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.000
Take a seat. How can I help you?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.560
Sorry, I'm looking for O.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.480
There is no need to apologize.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.959
Many women struggle to reach orgasm.
Please take a seat.

30:40.959 --> 30:43.360
No, O, the other sex therapist.

30:58.919 --> 31:00.080
What?

31:01.439 --> 31:03.840
- Otis! Otis! Okay...
- Oh!

31:03.840 --> 31:05.840
- Otis! No! Otis!
- Eric. Eric!

31:05.840 --> 31:07.360
Otis! Otis!

31:07.360 --> 31:08.760
- Sh!
- Otis! Otis!

31:08.760 --> 31:12.480
I think there is
another sex therapist on campus.

31:14.159 --> 31:15.879
What? That...

31:16.959 --> 31:19.000
that's what I was coming to tell you.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.600
I know, really.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.120
- I'm just--
- I can't help--

31:22.120 --> 31:24.040
- It is a lot!
- ...going out with...

31:26.360 --> 31:29.080
Okay, he is obviously a hack.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.840
Probably just taking people's money,
like Sex King.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.679
I need to...
I need to tell him to shut it down.

31:34.679 --> 31:35.959
Disgusting.

31:35.959 --> 31:38.840
Oh my God, Otis!
Look, free cookies.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.760
- Actually, they're carob bites.
- What's your name?

31:41.760 --> 31:44.080
- Timothy.
- Timothy. Nobody was asking you.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.320
...isn't just sex, right?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.679
- What?
- Yeah.

31:46.679 --> 31:47.760
Okay, what's this?

31:47.760 --> 31:49.840
You need an appointment
if you want to speak to O.

31:51.439 --> 31:53.560
You need an appointment
to change your attitude.

31:54.959 --> 31:56.080
Look. Oh my God.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.639
- There's a free slot Friday at 12:00.
- Yeah. That's four days away.

31:59.639 --> 32:02.000
Yeah, well,
I guess he's very popular, Oatcake.

32:06.439 --> 32:07.800
Otis!

32:08.679 --> 32:11.639
I've just had a cancelation.
Would you like to come in?

32:14.800 --> 32:16.320
- He's a she.
- Mmm.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.360
She knows your name.

32:18.879 --> 32:20.159
Come in, Otis.

32:21.399 --> 32:25.159
I saw you handin' out flyers
about your new clinic.

32:25.159 --> 32:27.240
Seems you wanna
set up a similar thing to me,

32:27.240 --> 32:29.040
so I thought it might be good to chat.

32:29.040 --> 32:34.679
Yeah. Uh... well, I was wondering
what your setup is here.

32:34.679 --> 32:38.560
Well, I just talk to people,
offer my advice.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.000
Please, take a wee seat.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.159
Uh...

32:42.159 --> 32:44.240
- Yeah, get yourself comfy.
- Thanks.

32:45.000 --> 32:45.840
Ah...

32:51.719 --> 32:52.560
Sorry.

32:52.560 --> 32:56.439
I'm not...
I'm not a very natural floor sitter.

32:57.199 --> 33:00.439
So, when did you come up
with all this, then?

33:00.439 --> 33:04.840
I started off making little
videos about sex and relationships,

33:04.840 --> 33:05.919
and I put them online.

33:05.919 --> 33:09.199
And then, I discovered the joy
of connecting to people face-to-face.

33:09.199 --> 33:10.199
Mmm.

33:10.199 --> 33:12.240
You've got a little stain on your back.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.399
- It's sick. My mum's just had a baby.
- Oh,

33:14.399 --> 33:17.360
Congratulations.
I'm a big fan of your mum's work.

33:17.959 --> 33:21.639
That must be quite an adjustment for you,
though. Having a newborn at home.

33:22.280 --> 33:23.560
Is she a single parent?

33:24.080 --> 33:28.919
- Well, yeah, but how... how did--
- I just say it 'cause you seem tired.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.399
Like you've been
helpin' out a lot at home.

33:31.399 --> 33:34.000
Joy was... the baby was premature.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.879
And my mum has gone through a breakup.

33:35.879 --> 33:37.560
Now she wants to work again,

33:37.560 --> 33:40.560
which is crazy,
because she is clearly overwhelmed.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.639
- And so I'm...
- Worried?

33:44.399 --> 33:46.360
Anyone you can ask for help?

33:46.360 --> 33:49.040
You know, I'm not here
to talk about my personal troubles.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.760
We need to discuss the...

33:53.199 --> 33:54.879
- The, uh...
- Is it bad news?

33:54.879 --> 33:56.520
No. It's the girl I'm seeing.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.760
- She's in America. She's coming home soon.
- Ah.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.399
- Have you had a fight?
- No.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.800
Uh, I mean... I mean, I don't know.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.400
She sent me a text, and I didn't respond,
and now she's annoyed at me.

34:09.759 --> 34:12.480
But can we please
just get back to talking about--

34:12.480 --> 34:13.960
Why didn't you respond?

34:14.679 --> 34:17.080
It just seems a bit dickish
to leave her waiting.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.040
She wanted me to send a nude.
That's illegal if you're under 18.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.799
I would not survive in prison.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.760
Interestin'.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.839
And is that the only reason
why you haven't replied?

34:27.440 --> 34:29.600
Well, I did take some pictures,
and I wasn't very happy

34:29.600 --> 34:31.040
with the way I looked in them.

34:31.040 --> 34:34.159
Okay, well, many men
struggle with body image.

34:34.159 --> 34:38.280
Taking photographs can feel confronting,
but could it be that you're afraid?

34:38.280 --> 34:40.719
Maybe you're afraid
of allowing yourself to be intimate

34:41.600 --> 34:43.679
when you're not sure
when she's coming back,

34:43.679 --> 34:45.199
or if she's coming back at all?

34:45.920 --> 34:48.319
- She is coming back.
- Okay.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.679
Well, I don't think it's viable

34:53.679 --> 34:55.839
to have two sex therapy clinics.

34:55.839 --> 34:59.520
Otis, I'm afraid that's actually
all we have time for today.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.839
Um, no. No, because
this was not an appointment.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.760
We need to discuss
what we're gonna do about our clinics.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.280
I was here first,
so I don't really have to do anything.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.680
- Well, I'm the original sex therapist, so...
- The original?

35:11.680 --> 35:15.400
- You have clearly stolen my idea.
- I haven't stolen anything, Otis.

35:16.120 --> 35:19.640
Women do have brains of their own.
But good luck with your clinic.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.520
I hope it works out for you.
Thanks for droppin' in.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.360
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.920
Did you tell her she was a hack?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.880
Hmm. Okay.

35:38.520 --> 35:39.400
What?

35:40.120 --> 35:43.240
Oh my God!
She has got thousands of followers.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.400
Well, then.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.400
<i>Hey, everyone. O here.</i>

35:49.400 --> 35:53.160
<i>Thanks for joining me again
on this week's episode of</i> Myth Busters,

35:53.160 --> 35:55.120
<i>where we're gonna talk about the hymen.</i>

35:55.120 --> 35:56.200
Popping your cherry.

35:56.200 --> 36:00.760
<i>I wanna make it clear that there is
no such thing as popping your cherry.</i>

36:00.760 --> 36:02.720
Wow!

36:03.240 --> 36:05.200
She's just like you!

36:05.200 --> 36:07.600
Except she's doin' it
on a much bigger and better scale.

36:08.319 --> 36:10.960
<i>- ...which comes in all shapes and sizes...</i>
- And she's like...

36:10.960 --> 36:13.040
- She's famous.
- She's stolen my idea.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.200
Mmm, I dunno. She has had a page
for a while now.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.160
And her advice wasn't even that helpful.

36:17.160 --> 36:20.920
She said I'm afraid to send Maeve my nudes
because I'm scared she's not coming back.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.560
Ah! When is she comin' back?

36:23.080 --> 36:27.080
I don't know. That's not the point, Eric.
I'm not... I'm not scared of anything.

36:28.120 --> 36:31.280
In fact, I'm going to send my nudes
right now.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.560
Oh my gosh. Ooh la la.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.640
Not that one.

36:36.799 --> 36:38.880
- How do you feel?
- So chill.

36:39.560 --> 36:40.480
Really chill.

36:42.319 --> 36:44.640
- Where are you going?
- To tell people about my clinic.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.880
Wait. Wait!

36:45.880 --> 36:48.160
Because public speaking
isn't your strong suit.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.560
Do you remember your party?

36:49.560 --> 36:52.240
Otis, I think that you
just need to think about this.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.960
She is not stealing my clinic.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.760
...chocolate or cotton.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.880
A healthy environment needs bees.

36:59.880 --> 37:03.200
- And without bees, we'd all be...
- I'm gonna go next.

37:04.319 --> 37:05.160
...dead.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.880
I love bees.

37:11.160 --> 37:14.040
Just remember to talk slowly.
And don't dance, okay?

37:14.040 --> 37:16.080
Okay.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.720
- Never dance.
- Okay.

37:24.359 --> 37:26.400
- Um...
- Hi. Hi, I'm Eric.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.480
I'm Eric.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.040
- That's Otis.
- Hello!

37:29.560 --> 37:32.319
Hi, everyone.
Um, I'm Otis Milburn.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.319
I'm new here. I'm with the whole
Moordale Secondary team.

37:36.319 --> 37:37.440
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.359
I wanted to let you know
a little bit about myself.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.480
So, uh, I'm 17 years old,

37:42.480 --> 37:46.600
and I spend a lot of my free time
thinkin' about sex.

37:47.200 --> 37:51.400
In fact, I live and breathe sex
all day, every day.

37:52.799 --> 37:55.280
I think he's doing, like,
a sex addict confession thing.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.920
Okay. Now, then. That came out wrong.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.040
Uh...

37:59.040 --> 38:00.680
What I meant to say is...

38:01.440 --> 38:04.440
...thinking about sex
comes very naturally to me

38:04.440 --> 38:08.440
because I learned everything I know
about sex from my mum.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.280
- Jesus.
- Oh.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.240
- This is dark.
- Jesus.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.600
We're here for you.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.880
- You're brave for sharing.
- No. Wait, no.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.400
That's not what I--
Please, no, don't clap.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.120
- No, no, no. No, no.
- Yeah!

38:20.120 --> 38:22.200
I'm not in a sexual relationship
with my mother.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.240
I know that's what it sounded like.
I'm not. I promise. That'd be... ugh!

38:25.240 --> 38:29.680
But I am interested in the subject
because of her and what she gives me--

38:29.680 --> 38:32.359
For goodness' sake!
Just tell them you're a sex therapist!

38:32.359 --> 38:34.080
Yes, I am.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.520
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna start again.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.600
I am a student sex therapist.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.400
And what I was trying to say before
is that I learned to be a good therapist

38:43.400 --> 38:46.600
because I grew up with my mum,
who is also a sex therapist.

38:46.600 --> 38:47.560
It's my calling.

38:47.560 --> 38:51.920
I have decided to set up my clinic here
and share my knowledge with you all.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.319
Hmm?

38:54.920 --> 38:57.000
Micro USB. Yes, very nice.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.760
Thank you. Ooh, it worked. Ta-da!

38:59.760 --> 39:01.480
We have a sex therapist already.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.520
I know you do.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.440
And I don't know how,

39:05.120 --> 39:06.920
but she has stolen my idea.

39:08.160 --> 39:11.640
And between me and O,
you should come to me,

39:12.200 --> 39:14.799
because I am the original and the best.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.720
What do you mean she stole it?

39:17.720 --> 39:19.920
Well, she--

39:19.920 --> 39:21.240
Um...

39:21.240 --> 39:24.280
I'll get back to you.
One sec. Go away, text.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.560
- Aah. Aaah!
- Oh my God!

39:29.560 --> 39:31.359
That's not me!

39:32.839 --> 39:34.359
Wow! Okay.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.480
Thank you for listening.
I'm Otis. I'm a sex therapist...

39:37.480 --> 39:38.880
- I--
- <i>Bluetooth connected.</i>

39:38.880 --> 39:40.200
Bluetooth? Oh my God!

39:41.600 --> 39:43.080
Oh my God. Okay. Cover your eyes.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.799
- Cover your eyes!
- Go away! Stop!

39:46.640 --> 39:48.000
Why is his penis flaccid?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.120
Go away. Oh God.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.760
Why are his pubes shaved like that?

39:55.040 --> 39:56.080
Cover your eyes.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.839
Stop! Don't look.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.160
That's... incredibly embarrassing.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.680
Please. Uh...

40:03.680 --> 40:04.600
Oh!

40:04.600 --> 40:06.960
- Oh God.
- Can someone help turn off the projector?

40:06.960 --> 40:09.520
For the love of God, please.
Quickly. Quickly.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.720
Thank you, Bee Lady. Thanks for listening.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.640
And I'll see you at my clinic. Hopefully.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.240
Jesus Christ.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.400
Wait for me!

40:24.400 --> 40:25.560
Otis!

40:28.880 --> 40:31.000
Tell me those photos
didn't send to Maeve.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.920
Get inside. Sit down.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
- They didn't.
- Hallelujah. Hallelujah, praise the Lord.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.040
- Did that really just happen?
- Yes.

40:40.319 --> 40:43.760
- Is everyone talking about me?
- Yes, but this college is weird.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.240
Nobody's saying anything mean.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.560
They all just feel sorry for you.
- Oh God!

40:47.560 --> 40:50.640
Why was your penis flaccid?

40:50.640 --> 40:52.480
People are
more into pictures of hard dicks.

40:52.480 --> 40:53.920
Erect just felt aggressive.

40:53.920 --> 40:58.000
Also, why were your pubes
shaved in that strange pattern?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.240
- Why was the camera so far away, Oatcake?
- I just--

41:01.240 --> 41:03.920
I over-shaved the right.
And I was trying to capture natural light.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.160
I can't believe this is happening.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.920
No one's gonna come and have therapy
with Creepy Pube Man.

41:10.319 --> 41:12.000
Hi, I need a therapy session.

41:14.280 --> 41:15.120
Uh, come in.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.480
Ahem.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.319
Oh, uh, yes, I will go.

41:25.319 --> 41:27.600
- Oh.
- I will go. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.640
Have a good session.

41:29.240 --> 41:30.280
Oh, God bless you.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.200
- Ahem.
- Ahem.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.560
Ah. Um...

41:34.359 --> 41:35.400
How can I help you?

41:36.319 --> 41:37.319
I just had an orgasm.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.080
Um, good for you.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.240
It wasn't great. It was very strange.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.720
It happened now, in the middle of college,
after I saw your photos.

41:45.480 --> 41:48.680
- Uh, well, I'm flattered.
- No, I don't think you understand.

41:48.680 --> 41:53.240
I'm not remotely attracted to you.
And your nudes were profoundly unsexy.

41:53.839 --> 41:54.960
Valid.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.799
I started taking testosterone
six months ago.

41:56.799 --> 41:59.160
The doctor warned me
it could feel like a second puberty.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.000
But now I'm horny all the time.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.120
Like, everything turns me on.
I jerked off twice this morning.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.400
Art class made me feel like
I was gonna get off,

42:06.400 --> 42:09.359
and then I saw your penis, and... boom.

42:09.359 --> 42:10.880
- Fu...
- Of course.

42:10.880 --> 42:14.560
Inexplicably, I came. So, I don't know.

42:14.560 --> 42:18.799
I don't wanna stop taking T,
but I feel like... I'm losing control,

42:18.799 --> 42:23.520
and I don't wanna be walkin' around,
coming... all the time.

42:27.760 --> 42:32.480
Well, spontaneous orgasms are rare,
but they're not unheard of,

42:32.480 --> 42:33.920
and it can happen to anyone.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.880
It definitely doesn't happen
to everyone who takes testosterone.

42:37.560 --> 42:42.240
And puberty makes us feel out of control
and unusually aroused.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.080
It sounds like you're describing
how it feels to be a teenage boy.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.000
Really?

42:47.000 --> 42:50.799
Yeah. And believe me, I have had
my fair share of poorly timed orgasms,

42:50.799 --> 42:53.640
and they are uncomfortable
and embarrassing.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.920
- Mmm.
- But I promise it doesn't last forever.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.520
Um...

42:57.520 --> 43:00.080
So I'm just like a horny teenage boy?

43:00.080 --> 43:01.920
- I thought I was disgusting.
- No.

43:01.920 --> 43:05.000
And I know it's hard,
but you should try and enjoy the journey.

43:05.520 --> 43:08.000
It's an opportunity to get to know
yourself and your body better.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.240
Thank you, Otis.

43:12.960 --> 43:15.720
Can I ask why you decided
to come and speak with me?

43:16.240 --> 43:18.520
You showed your flaccid penis
to the whole college,

43:18.520 --> 43:20.240
so I figured you wouldn't judge me.

43:29.839 --> 43:32.080
- Hey.
- Yeah, I think it's down there.

43:32.080 --> 43:34.200
Wow. You're really not over them.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.000
I'm workin' on it, all right?

43:36.000 --> 43:40.960
Anyway, neither of us have time to date.
This year is make or break, okay?

43:41.680 --> 43:42.720
Yeah, exactly!

43:42.720 --> 43:43.960
- Hey.
- Hi!

43:43.960 --> 43:46.640
- Did you get your tablet fixed?
- Yeah, I fixed me.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.440
Um, sorry. I... I fixed it.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.760
- Hey, I'm Beau.
- Jackson.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.120
I'll send you those notes on Dolly.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.520
- Oh.
- What's your last name?

43:57.240 --> 43:58.400
Um, it's...

44:04.680 --> 44:08.040
Vivienne Odusanya.
See you in class tomorrow.

44:08.040 --> 44:10.280
See you in class tomorrow.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.200
What was that about make or break?

44:15.440 --> 44:17.160
Wow. Vivienne Odusanya.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.920
- I'll see you in class tomorrow.
- This close.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.040
How was school?

44:28.799 --> 44:31.040
It was... terrible.

44:31.560 --> 44:33.879
There is another student doing therapy,

44:33.879 --> 44:39.080
and they've got a bloody channel
with loads of videos and followers.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.680
It just made my whole thing feel pathetic.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.480
You're not even listening.

44:46.319 --> 44:47.440
I'm sorry.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.319
I got the job!

44:50.319 --> 44:52.120
They want me to start right away.

44:52.120 --> 44:56.359
- Which I know is not ideal, but...
- Who is gonna look after Joy?

44:57.280 --> 44:59.240
Well, it's an early evening show.

44:59.240 --> 45:02.040
So I thought I could
take her to the studio sometimes,

45:02.040 --> 45:04.120
and sometimes you could watch her.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.080
Mum, we are struggling as it is.

45:06.839 --> 45:09.799
I've just started college.
I really don't think it's a good idea--

45:09.799 --> 45:10.760
Where's Joy?

45:11.760 --> 45:13.600
Where's Joy? Where?

45:14.160 --> 45:16.400
- I just got home, Mum.
- Oh! Oh!

45:16.400 --> 45:18.480
What do you mean, where's Joy?

45:18.480 --> 45:19.440
Joy!

45:28.520 --> 45:30.520
Whew. I must have put her to bed.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.200
I completely forgot.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.240
Panic over.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.120
Hey, I am worried about Mum.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.680
- Ah! Devastating.
- Eric!

46:07.680 --> 46:08.839
Uh-huh?

46:10.359 --> 46:13.839
The new pastor was asking me
why you're not baptized at church today.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.839
- I think you should do his course.
- Oh!

46:16.839 --> 46:18.480
Apparently, he's very progressive.

46:18.480 --> 46:22.080
Mum, we have already spoken about this,
and you know I'm not sure.

46:22.080 --> 46:25.120
- Okay? Ohhh!
- Please, Eric. All the girls are baptized.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.080
- So what?
- You're the only one left.

46:27.080 --> 46:29.520
It'd mean so much to me and your grandma.

46:31.560 --> 46:34.799
<i>♪ Storm or sun ♪</i>

46:36.000 --> 46:38.760
<i>- ♪ You're the only one... ♪</i>
- Okay.

46:38.760 --> 46:40.200
I'll think about it.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.280
Oh, Mum, um, what time was I born?

46:44.280 --> 46:45.359
- Ah!
- Ah?

46:45.359 --> 46:46.799
Who have you been speaking to?

46:47.960 --> 46:48.960
No one.

46:48.960 --> 46:53.240
- Hmm.
<i>- ♪ It's forever, not a year and a day... ♪</i>

46:55.920 --> 46:57.760
<i>♪ Rain... ♪</i>

46:57.760 --> 46:59.680

47:00.680 --> 47:01.960

47:03.040 --> 47:04.799
Oh!

47:07.000 --> 47:08.480
Thank you, Black Jesus.

47:17.480 --> 47:20.040
- Adam didn't start at Cavendish today.
- No.

47:20.720 --> 47:23.359
He's decided he doesn't want
to continue with school.

47:23.359 --> 47:25.600
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Michael.

47:26.640 --> 47:27.799
He's scared of you.

47:32.560 --> 47:33.960
I am working on myself.

47:36.160 --> 47:37.560
I'm doing therapy.

47:38.280 --> 47:39.680
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

47:40.839 --> 47:43.440
But if you want Adam to tell you things,

47:44.920 --> 47:46.839
you have to start
making an effort with him.

48:37.920 --> 48:40.359
You ignored me all day.
I feel like an idiot.

48:40.359 --> 48:43.680
I'm sorry. I didn't handle it well.
And I should have texted.

48:43.680 --> 48:46.640
I think I'm scared
to make myself vulnerable

48:46.640 --> 48:48.400
when I don't know you're coming back.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.640
Why wouldn't I come back?

48:50.640 --> 48:53.400
It sounds like you're having
a really great time over there.

48:53.400 --> 48:56.440
I am, but it's also hard
being away from home.

48:56.440 --> 48:58.839
<i>And I miss you. A lot.</i>

48:58.839 --> 49:00.040
Yeah. I miss you too.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.319
I am coming home.

49:05.040 --> 49:05.879
Well...

49:05.879 --> 49:08.839
<i>I don't think that photos are my thing.</i>

49:10.280 --> 49:12.240
But maybe we could try something else.

49:12.879 --> 49:14.960
Okay. What did you have in mind?

49:14.960 --> 49:16.760
I don't know. Um...

49:16.760 --> 49:19.319
Oh, I'm terrible
at this kind of thing.

49:19.319 --> 49:20.920
<i>It's okay.</i>

49:22.879 --> 49:24.359
<i>Mmm...</i>

49:24.359 --> 49:26.400
<i>What are you thinking about right now?</i>

49:26.920 --> 49:30.720
<i>I'm thinking about you being here with me.</i>

49:31.560 --> 49:34.960
And, uh... I'm taking my trousers off.

49:36.080 --> 49:36.960
Hang on a minute.

49:37.879 --> 49:38.920
Um...

49:43.760 --> 49:44.839
And I'm in my pants.

49:44.839 --> 49:45.920
Hang on a second.

49:53.879 --> 49:55.319
- You okay?
- What are you doing?

49:57.080 --> 50:00.960
I'm imagining you here with me.

50:02.080 --> 50:06.640
<i>And I'm taking off your clothes,
and I'm touching you.</i>

50:07.400 --> 50:09.680
<i>- Where are you touching me?
- </i>  Your face.

50:11.319 --> 50:13.720
- And your mouth.
<i>- </i>  Are you kissing me?

50:13.720 --> 50:14.680
<i>Yeah.</i>

50:15.960 --> 50:17.560
- Where?
- On your lips.

50:18.399 --> 50:20.879
And down your neck.

50:22.600 --> 50:24.240
Are you touching yourself?

50:24.240 --> 50:27.200
Yeah. Are you?
