Hey, Ollie!

00:34.040 --> 00:36.600
Look what we brought you
for breakfast!

00:36.760 --> 00:38.320
A big tower of...
[gasps]

00:38.440 --> 00:40.559
[both] What happened to you?

00:41.919 --> 00:43.360
There was noisy construction

00:43.519 --> 00:47.080
and beeping trucks
right under my window all night.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.960
I didn't sleep a honk!
I mean, a wink!

00:56.080 --> 00:58.440
Really? I must've slept right through it!

00:58.599 --> 01:01.239
Didn't bother me at all.
You, Stanley?

01:01.400 --> 01:04.679
Nope! The inside of my shell
is always quiet!

01:04.800 --> 01:05.920
Listen!

01:06.880 --> 01:08.679
[gasps] I can hear the ocean!

01:09.360 --> 01:11.800
Well, you're very lucky.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.560
-[yawns]
-Know what?

01:14.720 --> 01:18.240
We'll come back
after you've had a little nap, Ollie.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.200
[Ollie] Hello?

01:22.399 --> 01:23.520
Channel four!

01:23.640 --> 01:25.679
Why aren't you listening?

01:26.920 --> 01:31.080
Uh... Ollie?
You're acting a little funny.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.320
Did you get that nap?

01:35.640 --> 01:37.839
Poor Ollie's so tired,
he's cranky!

01:38.000 --> 01:40.119
Everybody needs a nap
now and then.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.199
But how do we get him
to take one?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.440
-One sheep. Two sheep.
-[whistles lullaby]

01:46.679 --> 01:48.320
Three sheep.

01:49.559 --> 01:52.960
I see what you're trying to do,
but it's no use.

01:53.119 --> 01:55.839
When it's day out,
I can never sheep.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.039
I mean, sleep.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.039
Now what?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.320
Don't know.
Too bad we aren't in Iceland.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.759
In the winter, it's dark
practically all day long there!

02:03.880 --> 02:06.160
It'd be the perfect place
for Ollie to get a nap.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.479
[gasps]
I'm having a brainstorm!

02:08.639 --> 02:12.799
Let's go to Iceland today!
And get this cat a nap.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.239
Whaddaya think, Ollie?

02:14.440 --> 02:16.680
[yawning]
Gotta wait for channel four

02:16.799 --> 02:18.200
to call back.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.040
-What did he say?
-Hmm... yes?

02:21.160 --> 02:23.040
Good enough for me! Let's go!

02:29.400 --> 02:30.640
Whoo!

02:31.359 --> 02:33.079
Whee!

02:42.079 --> 02:46.000
<i>Now arriving in Iceland! Yay!</i>

02:50.160 --> 02:54.079
Look, Ollie! It's daytime here,
and it's dark outside!

02:54.720 --> 02:55.880
Amazing, right?

02:56.799 --> 02:58.959
I'll tell you what's amazing. Look!

02:59.079 --> 03:00.519
[yawns] It's Inuk!

03:01.120 --> 03:04.519
Inuk? Buddy!
What are you doing here?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.959
Oh, wow! Hi, guys!
Just flew in from Greenland!

03:07.120 --> 03:10.040
Big party today!
Northern Lights! Oh! Ah!

03:10.200 --> 03:11.760
-Nice.
-Um...

03:11.920 --> 03:13.280
Um...

03:13.880 --> 03:17.560
Inuk's on his way to a big party
to watch the Northern Lights.

03:17.720 --> 03:22.399
Oh! The Northern Lights!
Of course!

03:22.560 --> 03:24.959
-What's that?
-It's a natural light display

03:25.160 --> 03:26.799
that colours the sky in Iceland.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.760
I've always wanted to see them.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.160
Then come along! Big party!
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!

03:33.720 --> 03:35.079
Huh?

03:35.200 --> 03:36.239
Oh. Sorry, sorry, sorry!

03:36.359 --> 03:38.840
I always go too fast.
Let me help you!

03:41.679 --> 03:43.480
-[sighs]
-Oh, don't mind Ollie.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.840
He needs a nap.

03:48.239 --> 03:49.600
Lots to see
on the way to the lights!

03:49.720 --> 03:52.840
-Don't miss it! Don't, don't!
-Wow! What a place!

03:52.959 --> 03:54.480
So beautiful!

03:54.600 --> 03:56.880
[yawns]

03:58.440 --> 04:00.519
Ollie, you're yawn-yawn-yawning!

04:00.640 --> 04:02.959
How about nap-nap-napping?

04:04.040 --> 04:06.760
[yawns] No, I'm fine really.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.160
Look at this! Natural geyser!
Super cool! Huh, Ollie?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.920
Uh-oh. Sounds like rain.

04:14.359 --> 04:17.120
That's it! Lullaby goodnight!

04:20.079 --> 04:22.599
Please,
I'm much too big for a nap.

04:22.719 --> 04:24.920
Nope. Never too big.
Fixing this!

04:28.360 --> 04:32.000
-What a lovely Icelandic home!
-In you go, go, go.

04:32.159 --> 04:34.840
Oh!
And a famous Icelandic duvet!

04:34.960 --> 04:36.280
A what?

04:36.400 --> 04:39.360
It's a big cosy blanket
stuffed with duck feathers,

04:39.520 --> 04:41.520
for the cosiest sleep ever!

04:41.919 --> 04:43.800
What a great place to sleep!

04:43.960 --> 04:48.000
Especially
when it's so dark outside!

04:50.120 --> 04:52.840
[snoring]

04:53.840 --> 04:55.240
Hmm?

04:55.360 --> 04:58.360
They're sleeping!
I can't believe it!

04:58.520 --> 05:01.320
They're much too big for...
[yawns]

05:01.440 --> 05:03.240
naps!

05:03.400 --> 05:06.159
And they're going to miss
the Northern Lights party!

05:07.000 --> 05:08.719
OK. Let's go, go, go, go, go!

05:15.240 --> 05:17.440
The party is here!
Best viewing spot ever.

05:17.599 --> 05:21.159
-Can't be late!
-Oh, good! I love maps.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.880
I'm the map guy!

05:23.039 --> 05:25.919
You can count on me
to get us to the viewing spot!

05:26.039 --> 05:28.520
[yawning]
I can't wait to see the lights.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.880
Let's go, go, go!

05:31.719 --> 05:33.479
-Wakey, wakey, wakey!
-Huh?

05:33.640 --> 05:35.680
What's the... ?
I'm reading the map!

05:35.840 --> 05:37.000
I'm reading it!

05:37.120 --> 05:39.599
Northern Lights, here we come!

05:46.280 --> 05:51.400
Uh... Turn right at the next
crossroads and then take a left.

05:52.359 --> 05:53.359
Ah!

05:53.520 --> 05:55.400
Ah! Eh! Are we there?

05:55.640 --> 05:58.039
Nope! A dead end!
Lost, lost, lost, lost!

05:58.479 --> 06:01.760
-But the map said...
-You mean the upside-down map?

06:01.880 --> 06:03.400
I read it upside down?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.800
That's never happened to me
before!

06:05.919 --> 06:11.120
Uh... Do you think
maybe you're making mistakes

06:11.240 --> 06:13.599
'cause you're really tired?

06:13.760 --> 06:16.599
-Pff. Napping is for babies!
-Nuh-uh!

06:16.760 --> 06:19.120
We just had naps,
and we feel great!

06:19.280 --> 06:21.359
-You should try it!
-No time!

06:21.520 --> 06:23.359
We're off to see the...

06:23.479 --> 06:25.880
Sthgil Nrehtron!

06:26.560 --> 06:29.680
Oops! I mean, Northern Lights!

06:29.840 --> 06:31.680
I had it backwards that time.
Heh.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.479
Ah! We're going to be
late, late, late

06:33.640 --> 06:36.159
-to the Northern Lights party!
-Don't worry, Inuk.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.120
We'll get to the party in time.
Won't we, Ollie?

06:39.280 --> 06:41.359
Yeah! Of course! I got this.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.039
[sighs]

06:43.200 --> 06:45.840
Just need to hop out
and figure out where we are!

06:48.799 --> 06:50.240
Be right back!

06:57.840 --> 06:59.599
Hmm. You don't think

06:59.760 --> 07:02.960
he's sleepwalking off
into the wilderness, do you?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.320
-Hmm... yes?
-Gulp!

07:06.599 --> 07:08.560
[panting]

07:08.919 --> 07:10.120
Ollie!

07:10.280 --> 07:12.359
-Ollie, Ollie, Ollie!
-Ollie?

07:12.520 --> 07:14.359
[snoring]

07:16.640 --> 07:18.560
[yawning]
Five more minutes.

07:19.359 --> 07:23.039
Uh... Uh, right here, guys!
I know exactly where we are now!

07:23.159 --> 07:24.680
-You do?
-Yes, yes, yes!

07:25.080 --> 07:28.680
We can take a short cut
through here. Follow me!

07:33.880 --> 07:39.440
Not much further this way
past my bed into dreamland.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.840
Huh?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.280
-Ick, ick, ick!
-Ugh! Mud!

07:46.239 --> 07:48.320
Ugh!
Gonna need to find a shell-wash.

07:49.039 --> 07:50.880
Huh? What happened?

07:51.039 --> 07:53.919
You fell asleep
and led us right into icky mud!

07:54.120 --> 07:58.239
No, according to the map,
I led us into the Blue Lagoon spa.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.640
This mud isn't icky.
It's special mud.

08:01.799 --> 08:04.280
People come from all over
the world to bathe in it.

08:04.440 --> 08:08.000
Map, please! Need the map!
Need the map! Need the map!

08:08.159 --> 08:11.440
Mud! Muddy map! All over!
Where are we going? I dunno!

08:11.599 --> 08:13.679
Northern Lights party! Poof!
[cries]

08:13.840 --> 08:16.679
Oh, Inuk. We're so sorry.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.719
We're lost
and the map is ruined.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.640
And we're gonna miss
the Northern Lights party...

08:22.760 --> 08:25.280
[both]
Just because Ollie wouldn't nap!

08:25.719 --> 08:27.440
What? This isn't my fault!

08:27.599 --> 08:30.359
I don't need a nap!
I've told you over and over!

08:30.719 --> 08:34.799
I'm a big cat!
And big cats don't nap!

08:35.000 --> 08:37.199
They don't nap!

08:41.559 --> 08:43.760
Did...
did I just throw a tantrum?

08:44.319 --> 08:45.880
Ahem, yes.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.920
-Like a cranky baby?
-Mmm-hmm.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.240
You could say that.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.240
Wow, guys.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.360
I thought I was too big to nap,
but I was really wrong.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.280
If you can still
get to the party in time,

08:57.480 --> 08:59.000
then go for it.

09:00.360 --> 09:06.840
[yawning]
I just hope Inuk can forgive me.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.120
[snores]

09:09.280 --> 09:12.319
-I think he's...
-Sound asleep!

09:13.199 --> 09:15.400
Now that Ollie's finally sleeping,

09:15.560 --> 09:19.600
maybe we'll still be able
to make the party if we hurry?
