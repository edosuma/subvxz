00:01.265 --> 00:03.402
You're having a miserable time.

00:03.467 --> 00:06.306
No, no. This is
really quite stimulating.

00:08.572 --> 00:10.309
All right, Higgins,
what's going on?

00:10.574 --> 00:13.246
Thomas, you've gone too far when
you're spying on your own friends.

00:13.311 --> 00:14.413
I'm not spying!

00:14.946 --> 00:16.181
Why are you dressed like that?

00:16.248 --> 00:18.449
How much do you know about
this woman you've been seeing?

00:22.954 --> 00:24.457
She's setting you up.
Can't you see?

00:24.523 --> 00:26.794
You're doing everything you
can to avoid responsibility.

00:26.859 --> 00:27.994
Are you quite finished?

02:01.230 --> 02:03.635
There's a funny thing
about Paradise.

02:03.699 --> 02:07.105
Every day is pretty much
the same as every other day.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.175
One slides into another.
Weeks become months.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.847
And before you know it, you could lose
several years without really noticing

02:13.910 --> 02:15.513
where you were going.

02:15.580 --> 02:19.821
That's why there are hurricanes.
To shake everything up.

02:19.883 --> 02:22.756
Give you a chance to take
stock of what you have left

02:22.820 --> 02:24.422
after the winds have died down.

02:24.490 --> 02:27.462
Higgins?
What is the meaning of this?

02:29.328 --> 02:30.763
What do you think you're doing?

02:30.829 --> 02:31.830
Jogging.

02:31.897 --> 02:34.134
I can see that. I mean, why?

02:35.934 --> 02:37.036
Why not?

02:37.102 --> 02:40.944
Well, no reason, I guess. I just can't
remember you ever jogging on the beach before.

02:41.007 --> 02:43.645
Quite possibly because
you're never up at this hour.

02:43.711 --> 02:48.120
Oh, I get it. You're getting
in shape for your vacation.

02:48.182 --> 02:49.684
What is it going
to be this year?

02:49.749 --> 02:52.421
Kayaking down the
treacherous Noatak River?

02:52.486 --> 02:54.457
Scaling the mighty Kanchenjunga?

02:54.523 --> 02:57.929
Leading a camel caravan
from Kandahar to Kabul? What?

02:59.161 --> 03:01.598
Actually, I've decided to spend
two quiet weeks at home.

03:01.664 --> 03:02.732
What? Here.

03:02.798 --> 03:03.799
Here? Precisely.

03:03.865 --> 03:05.969
What? Wait, wait a minute!

03:06.669 --> 03:10.043
Higgins, you always go away and you
always get someone to replace you.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.744
A replacement will be hired,
but I shan't be going away.

03:12.809 --> 03:16.550
You're staying here because of me,
aren't you? I've told you, I'm fine.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.416
And I'm not arguing the point.
As a matter of fact,

03:18.482 --> 03:20.085
you I leCOVely
has been quite remarkable.

03:26.924 --> 03:28.727
What about Quang Ki?

03:28.792 --> 03:29.794
What about him?

03:29.861 --> 03:32.142
I thought you said you'd be
tied up testifying against him.

03:32.163 --> 03:34.535
That's three weeks away.
Don't change the subject.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.870
I can handle this job and there's
no reason... You're quite right.

03:36.935 --> 03:38.738
What... What did you say?

03:38.804 --> 03:41.743
I said you're quite right.
The post is yours.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.245
You mean you trust me?

03:44.311 --> 03:45.312
Of course.

03:45.378 --> 03:47.916
All right, Higgins.
What's going on?

03:48.415 --> 03:51.387
You never trust me.
You're out jogging.

03:51.451 --> 03:53.254
You're not going
away on holiday.

03:53.321 --> 03:56.326
You've disappeared every Tuesday
for the last three weeks,

03:56.390 --> 04:00.431
and now you tell me you trust me to take
care of the estate while you're on vacation.

04:00.495 --> 04:02.700
Are you feeling all right,
Higgins?

04:02.764 --> 04:06.304
I've never felt better.
Oh, there is one thing.

04:06.368 --> 04:07.403
Aha!

04:07.469 --> 04:10.074
I wonder if you would consider
taking Agatha to the symphony.

04:10.139 --> 04:13.646
I have the tickets but unfortunately,
I'm obliged to be out this evening.

04:13.710 --> 04:15.413
With a business associate.

04:15.478 --> 04:18.283
Your Tuesday afternoon
business associate?

04:20.250 --> 04:23.490
May I tell Agatha you'll
pick her up at 7:30?

04:23.554 --> 04:25.190
Yeah, I guess so.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.459
I am deeply indebted.

04:28.559 --> 04:31.632
He's up to something.
I don't know what it is.

04:31.929 --> 04:34.934
But whatever it is,
I'm not falling for it.

04:41.139 --> 04:46.016
Why'd he bring up Quang Ki? Does he think
I should be doing something about that?

04:46.612 --> 04:48.182
And what does he think
I could do?

04:48.247 --> 04:50.619
Not a thing. You did
everything you could.

04:50.684 --> 04:54.358
Nothing left to do now
but have dessert. Cream puff?

04:56.590 --> 04:57.726
Mac?

04:58.358 --> 05:00.529
You really ought to try one.

05:01.796 --> 05:04.701
No, no. You're not
going to do this.

05:04.766 --> 05:06.002
Magnum, I know
what you're thinking.

05:06.067 --> 05:08.471
But there's nothing you can
do for Father Tim now.

05:08.536 --> 05:10.874
You don't know
what I'm thinking.

05:14.843 --> 05:16.179
Are you...

05:18.648 --> 05:20.017
Am I what?

05:21.551 --> 05:22.986
No, nothing.

05:28.024 --> 05:30.763
Hey, how about an éclair?

05:32.530 --> 05:36.604
I'm not talking to you. You just
confuse me when you show up.

05:36.668 --> 05:39.440
I'm tired of trying to figure you out.
As far as I'm concerned

05:39.504 --> 05:42.343
you don't exist. I'm not even going
to think about you anymore. Ever!

05:42.407 --> 05:46.047
Hey, now, you see, Magnum,
that's where you're going wrong.

05:46.111 --> 05:49.551
You see, if you don't want to think about
somebody, the worst thing you can say

05:49.616 --> 05:52.388
is you're not going to think about 'em
because that just makes you think about 'em

05:52.452 --> 05:54.155
a little more.

05:54.220 --> 05:58.227
And it doesn't make any difference
whether it's me or Father Tim.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.796
Gee, that's delicious.

06:01.195 --> 06:06.606
Mac, you're going to... Forget it.
I'm not falling for it.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.337
Oh, Magnum. You're not here!

06:08.403 --> 06:10.172
I'm not going to look at you. Magnum!
We really gotta talk about this!

06:10.238 --> 06:11.840
I'm not going to listen to you.
Magnum!

06:11.906 --> 06:13.276
I'm not going to have
anything to do with you.

06:13.341 --> 06:16.781
Magnum! Magnum! Did you see
the sun rise this morning?

06:21.517 --> 06:25.091
Did you ever turn around
to see what happened?

06:25.154 --> 06:26.422
Well, no.

06:27.356 --> 06:28.592
I see.

06:33.263 --> 06:37.705
I mean, it was all so bizarre, I was
having this conversation with Higgins,

06:37.769 --> 06:41.776
which was a little strange,
too, but at least he was there.

06:45.410 --> 06:47.715
At least, I think he was there.

06:47.780 --> 06:51.687
No, he was. He definitely was.

06:52.217 --> 06:55.924
Uh, and then along came Mac,

06:58.591 --> 07:00.294
and I don't know.

07:01.161 --> 07:02.429
Mmm-hmm.

07:02.997 --> 07:08.775
J I mean... l wouldn't be here
at all it was just so strange.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.175
I see.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.021
So, what do you think?

07:25.087 --> 07:26.924
What do you think?

07:26.989 --> 07:30.363
I think I'm paying you a lot of
money to find out what you think.

07:30.426 --> 07:31.728
I see.

07:34.263 --> 07:36.401
This is probably a mistake.

07:37.301 --> 07:38.501
Is that what you really think?

07:38.535 --> 07:44.046
I think that I just wanted to get it
off my chest, that's all. Thanks.

07:44.108 --> 07:47.180
Obviously, you didn't want to hear
what your friend Mac had to say,

07:47.245 --> 07:50.084
so, in your unconscious mind,
you caused him to explode.

07:50.148 --> 07:52.686
And you don't want
to look at that.

08:02.763 --> 08:03.998
Is that what you think?

08:04.064 --> 08:08.473
You're afraid of having mature, grown
up relationships with your friends.

08:09.236 --> 08:12.375
In fact, everything about you says
you're terrified of growing up.

08:12.439 --> 08:14.009
Now, wait a minute...

08:14.075 --> 08:15.711
The way you dress. Your job.

08:15.777 --> 08:17.045
What about my job?

08:17.110 --> 08:20.550
You've created
a fantasy world for yourself,

08:20.615 --> 08:23.588
living off the good graces
of an absent father figure

08:23.652 --> 08:27.126
while you chase down bad guys
and bring justice to the world.

08:27.189 --> 08:29.126
And what's wrong
with a little justice?

08:29.191 --> 08:32.030
You can't even look me
straight in the eye.

08:33.630 --> 08:35.099
I can, too!

08:38.234 --> 08:42.174
Don't you think it's about time you
began to dress like a grown man?

08:42.238 --> 08:44.610
Get a real iob?
Buy your own car?

08:44.975 --> 08:48.950
Well, this has all been
very enlightening. Really.

08:49.014 --> 08:50.254
But you're not ready to hear it.

08:50.314 --> 08:54.088
I want to thank you for your time.
But I won't be back. I'm cured.

08:59.658 --> 09:03.500
A further note about hurricanes, they
aren't always weather conditions.

09:03.563 --> 09:06.702
Once in awhile, a tropical storm
blows into your life to give you

09:06.766 --> 09:10.140
a chance to take a more
personal kind of inventory.

09:10.971 --> 09:13.343
A chance to look
at what's worth salvaging

09:13.407 --> 09:15.944
and what you might
as well toss out.

09:21.448 --> 09:24.454
I find Mendelssohn so...
How should I say it?

09:26.254 --> 09:27.389
Loud?

09:28.757 --> 09:32.898
What a shame Jonathan had to stay
in and work on the monthly budget.

09:32.962 --> 09:34.365
Is that what he told you?

09:34.430 --> 09:35.799
Of course.

09:36.832 --> 09:38.168
Isn't that what he's doing?

09:38.234 --> 09:41.741
Well, yeah, I guess so. Can I
get you something, a drink?

09:41.805 --> 09:43.708
Oh. Excuse me a moment.

09:44.641 --> 09:46.311
Hey, Thomas!

09:47.945 --> 09:49.715
Rick? You believe it?

09:49.780 --> 09:52.151
Five bucks for sherbet and soda!

09:52.215 --> 09:54.320
I mean Tchaikovsky
Summer Citrus Surprise!

09:54.385 --> 09:56.186
These guys need
some help naming their drinks.

09:56.188 --> 09:57.323
What are you doing here?

09:57.388 --> 09:59.860
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

09:59.925 --> 10:01.260
You never come to these things.

10:01.325 --> 10:02.327
That's not true.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.798
Trying to impress
a hot date, Thomas?

10:04.863 --> 10:06.968
No, I happen
to like Mendelssohn.

10:07.033 --> 10:09.872
Yeah? I like
the big sound myself.

10:10.335 --> 10:14.042
As a matter of fact, I would've even come
alone, but being that I had two tickets,

10:14.108 --> 10:17.113
I figured why not invite someone
that really likes classical music.

10:17.177 --> 10:18.379
Like Danielle.

10:18.444 --> 10:19.547
Danielle?

10:19.613 --> 10:20.614
She's really something.

10:20.681 --> 10:22.384
Oh, that looks refreshing.
Thanks.

10:22.449 --> 10:23.818
Danielle, say hello to Thomas.

10:23.884 --> 10:24.953
Hello. Hi.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.589
Hi, I don't remember
seeing you here before.

10:26.654 --> 10:29.259
Thomas doesn't go
in for this high brow stuff.

10:29.323 --> 10:31.293
I wouldn't say that, Rick.

10:31.359 --> 10:33.563
Ah, so where's your date?

10:34.663 --> 10:38.303
Oh, actually I don't have one. I'm escorting
Agatha. Higgins couldn't make it.

10:38.366 --> 10:41.205
She must've had a fit when she found
out that he dumped her just to go

10:41.270 --> 10:42.605
to an opening of a night club.

10:42.672 --> 10:45.210
Night club? He told me he
had a business appointment.

10:45.274 --> 10:48.513
I don't know what kind of business
you conduct at the Stage West,

10:48.579 --> 10:50.783
but I know for a fact that Higgins
went to the grand opening

10:50.847 --> 10:54.287
because I finagled the
two tickets, uh, myself.

11:00.391 --> 11:02.628
I'm feeling a little overtired.

11:02.694 --> 11:05.433
Perhaps you wouldn't mind
taking me home?

11:18.878 --> 11:20.080
Ha!

11:35.764 --> 11:38.068
You're having a miserable time!

11:38.700 --> 11:41.939
No, no. This is
really quite stimulating.

11:42.004 --> 11:43.741
But you don't like it.

11:43.805 --> 11:47.279
I'm sure I could learn to like it.
Given a little time.

11:47.644 --> 11:50.483
We have to unlock
the wild animal inside you.

11:52.149 --> 11:55.054
Perhaps if, uh, you
drew a diagram of the steps.

11:55.119 --> 11:57.891
No diagrams. Come on,
move to the music.

11:57.955 --> 11:59.692
Feel it! Come on. Feel it!

11:59.757 --> 12:02.162
I really think I should
watch a little longer.

12:02.227 --> 12:04.765
No more watching.
Come on, dance.

12:06.765 --> 12:08.869
Ye_h, arriba!

12:10.468 --> 12:11.536
Ooh!

12:16.709 --> 12:17.877
Mira.

12:24.583 --> 12:25.852
Arriba.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.239
You're wonderful.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.709
Thank you.

12:46.175 --> 12:48.847
I'd stay away from her
if I were you.

12:49.112 --> 12:50.481
Now see here... Let go of me!

12:51.747 --> 12:53.685
Release her at once!

12:53.750 --> 12:55.954
Don't you think you oughta
go home and sleep this off?

12:56.019 --> 12:57.355
Hey! You're supposed to be
at the symphony.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.992
And you're supposed to be
at a business meeting.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.270
Hey, you okay?

13:11.736 --> 13:12.805
What are you doing here?

13:12.871 --> 13:14.173
Looking for you.

13:14.239 --> 13:15.341
Why?

13:15.907 --> 13:18.479
I don't know. I just thought maybe
if you weren't doing anything,

13:18.543 --> 13:20.380
I could buy you a beer.

13:20.445 --> 13:22.081
Where's Higgins?

13:25.184 --> 13:27.222
Would you like to dance?

13:36.061 --> 13:39.233
This is the third time this week
you've appeared out of nowhere.

13:39.297 --> 13:40.700
Just lucky coincidence, I guess.

13:40.765 --> 13:43.704
Yeah, that's what I thought at first,
but now, I'm beginning to wonder.

13:43.768 --> 13:44.836
What?

13:44.904 --> 13:47.809
You don't need to check up on me, T.C.
I'm fine.

13:47.873 --> 13:50.712
Check up on you?
That's ridiculous.

13:52.011 --> 13:55.284
No. I mean, there was something I
wanted to talk to you about, but...

13:55.348 --> 13:56.516
What?

13:56.983 --> 13:59.020
It's not that important.

14:01.054 --> 14:03.292
I just don't want
to talk to you about it here.

14:03.357 --> 14:06.062
Why not? Nobody's paying
any attention to us.

14:06.127 --> 14:10.636
I am. Go ahead.
What's on your mind?

14:10.699 --> 14:15.475
Okay, boys, you're going home. I convinced
the arresting officer to drop the charges.

14:15.537 --> 14:18.677
I explained to him that you're still
a little, you know. From the coma.

14:18.741 --> 14:20.878
Why'd you do that?
I told you I'm fine.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.949
It worked, didn't it? Listen,
this isn't even my department.

14:24.013 --> 14:25.716
Uh, and we appreciate
it, Lieutenant.

14:25.783 --> 14:28.588
We really do. Oh, and did you
find out anything about the guy

14:28.652 --> 14:30.389
that started the fight?

14:30.454 --> 14:32.758
Nothing on anyone
matching that description.

14:32.822 --> 14:34.625
Probably isn't even a local guy.

14:34.692 --> 14:39.335
Oh, oh, come on. Just a second, Lieutenant.
Did you find Higgins?

14:39.897 --> 14:42.802
Magnum, you can't put out a
missing persons on a grown man

14:42.867 --> 14:45.272
until he's been missing
for at least 48 hours.

14:45.337 --> 14:49.379
Go home. Get some sleep. You're probably
making a mountain out of a molehill.

14:49.442 --> 14:51.212
Yeah. You're right.

14:53.646 --> 14:58.656
Observation three about tropical storms.
The weather kind or the personal kind.

14:58.719 --> 15:02.393
Once you know they're on their way,
there's nothing you can do to stop them.

15:02.456 --> 15:04.593
All you can do is
batten down the hatches,

15:04.658 --> 15:06.629
keep alert,
and hope for the best.

15:06.694 --> 15:08.163
At ease, men.

15:08.329 --> 15:12.470
Well, I guess you don't want any
help figuring out where Higgins is.

16:06.694 --> 16:09.733
Higgins! Open up! I know
you're in there! Higgins!

16:09.797 --> 16:11.935
Go away! It's nearly noon!

16:11.999 --> 16:14.136
And I'm on holiday! Go away!

16:24.246 --> 16:26.684
Higgins. This has gone far enough.
What do you have to say for yourself?

16:26.749 --> 16:28.017
Goodbye.

16:29.318 --> 16:33.059
Staying out all night,
picking fights in bars,

16:33.122 --> 16:37.197
behaving like a, a love crazed adolescent.
I demand an explanation!

16:38.295 --> 16:39.797
I'm on holiday.

16:39.864 --> 16:42.235
Okay, I'll grant you that,
Higgins, but I can't just stand by

16:42.299 --> 16:43.969
and watch you do this
to yourself.

16:44.034 --> 16:46.873
I mean, I know, it's a common
occurrence, Higgins. At a certain age,

16:46.938 --> 16:50.780
there's a tendency to want to try to
recapture your lost youth, but...

16:54.780 --> 16:58.621
All right. I'm just going to
come straight out with it.

16:58.918 --> 17:02.457
How much do you know about
this woman you've been seeing?

17:02.522 --> 17:03.824
Why are you dressed like that?

17:03.890 --> 17:05.192
Like what? Like that.

17:05.258 --> 17:09.398
I don't know. I mean, I just felt like wearing
a jacket and a tie, that's all, Higgins.

17:09.462 --> 17:13.404
We're not discussing my sartorial
habits, Higgins. We're discussing you!

17:13.467 --> 17:19.412
And it's a fascinating topic of discussion.
However, just at the moment,

17:20.074 --> 17:22.712
I'm afraid I'm in the middle
of something else.

17:22.778 --> 17:24.580
What? Sleeping!

17:29.919 --> 17:31.856
It won't work, Higgins!

17:33.389 --> 17:35.526
You can't avoid me forever!

17:37.493 --> 17:40.565
So he's acting a little strange.
People go through cycles, you know?

17:40.631 --> 17:42.266
He's probably just going
through a phase.

17:42.332 --> 17:45.138
Well, that's fine. As long as somebody
doesn't try and take advantage of him

17:45.202 --> 17:47.072
while he's phased out.
How's the transmission?

17:47.137 --> 17:49.608
Like new. What do you mean,
take advantage of him?

17:49.674 --> 17:52.045
Well, you know. Try to trick
him out of some money.

17:52.109 --> 17:53.144
Or... I don't know.

17:53.210 --> 17:55.782
Are we speaking
about Higgins? Or you?

17:55.847 --> 17:58.552
What? Because if you don't
want to buy my car, Thomas,

17:58.616 --> 18:02.458
there are a lot of people who are
interested. No, I want the car. I think.

18:02.521 --> 18:04.023
Has it ever been in a wreck?

18:04.089 --> 18:05.525
It's never even had a scratch!

18:05.591 --> 18:07.896
I've babied it since the day I bought it.
And it's not like

18:07.961 --> 18:09.330
you've never seen this car.

18:09.395 --> 18:12.100
Well, I've also seen
the way you drive.

18:12.164 --> 18:13.567
Oh, well, forget it.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.901
No. Come on. I'm just kidding.

18:16.336 --> 18:17.806
I'm sure it's fine.

18:19.106 --> 18:24.484
Do you know, I'm not so sure that Higgins
is the one who's acting strange.

18:24.545 --> 18:28.252
I think that you're the one who's
acting strange. You're dressed funny.

18:28.316 --> 18:31.055
You don't sound like you. You're
taking everything so seriously.

18:31.119 --> 18:32.956
You won't even
look me in the eye.

18:33.021 --> 18:34.424
That's not true.

18:34.490 --> 18:36.828
It is too, Thomas.
And don't get cute with me.

18:36.893 --> 18:40.165
Hi guys. You just don't
seem like you anymore.

18:40.229 --> 18:44.771
Oh, what about you? I mean,
look at the way you're dressed,

18:45.368 --> 18:48.040
and since when were you
interested in fancy sports cars?

18:48.104 --> 18:52.011
Using your inheritance to get a Porsche.
That doesn't sound like you at all.

18:52.076 --> 18:55.349
Well, perhaps you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

18:55.413 --> 18:56.916
Obviously not.

18:56.982 --> 18:58.585
Looks like I caught you
at a bad time.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.387
No, T.C. I was just leaving.

19:00.452 --> 19:01.453
Carol...

19:06.993 --> 19:08.696
What's wrong with Higgie baby?

19:08.761 --> 19:14.005
Uh, Carol. You can't leave. Not till
I've had a test drive. Come on, come on.

19:15.234 --> 19:18.908
And I'm fine, T.C. I don't need
anybody to watch out over me. Okay?

19:18.972 --> 19:20.074
Yeah, sure.

19:43.866 --> 19:47.741
You know a test drive is usually
one quick turn around the block.

19:47.804 --> 19:51.278
Don't be so narrow in your thinking, Carol.
It's limiting.

19:51.341 --> 19:53.678
Where are we going, Thomas?

19:53.743 --> 19:56.148
That's what I intend
to find out.

20:18.004 --> 20:19.507
Aloha. Gracias.

20:30.317 --> 20:32.454
You are spying on Jonathan.

20:34.321 --> 20:37.260
Do you have a pen or pencil?
Something I can write with?

20:37.324 --> 20:40.063
Thomas, you've gone too far, when
you're spying on your own friends.

20:40.129 --> 20:42.834
I am not spying on Higgins.
Yes, you are!

20:44.667 --> 20:46.002
All right.

20:48.170 --> 20:50.040
I'm going to tell you something,

20:50.107 --> 20:53.146
something I wouldn't
ordinarily talk about.

20:54.144 --> 20:58.553
The thing is,
I think Higgins is...

21:01.785 --> 21:04.290
I don't know! I just feel
kinda responsible for him.

21:04.354 --> 21:07.928
You know, like anybody that
you spend a lot of time with.

21:10.062 --> 21:12.666
I just don't want to
see him explode.

21:13.431 --> 21:14.667
Explode?

21:16.101 --> 21:18.172
That's a figure of speech.

21:18.238 --> 21:23.081
Uh, I don't want to see anything bad happen
to him if I can help it. That's all.

21:27.914 --> 21:30.286
Ah ha! I knew it.

21:30.350 --> 21:31.920
Who is that?

21:31.986 --> 21:34.725
The bouncer at Stage West
told me her name is Rosita.

21:34.789 --> 21:37.861
She's from Bolivia. She's only
been in this country six months.

21:37.925 --> 21:39.628
Pretty well informed bouncer.

21:39.694 --> 21:40.997
Well, she's well known
at all the clubs.

21:41.063 --> 21:44.703
She used to be a regular at the Club
Del Mar Chino until they closed.

21:44.766 --> 21:46.436
Apparently she loves to dance.

21:46.501 --> 21:47.836
Ooh! So?

22:05.022 --> 22:06.291
Anything?

22:06.357 --> 22:11.066
Have you ever considered that maybe,
just maybe she likes Jonathan?

22:11.129 --> 22:15.505
Yes. I've also considered she may be looking
to get her green card the easy way.

22:15.567 --> 22:16.902
Oh!

22:18.470 --> 22:24.281
Tofu burgers, raw vegetable salad,
carrot juice and green magma?

22:24.342 --> 22:25.878
You like green magma.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.417
I do. But what are you
going to eat?

22:28.481 --> 22:30.752
Oh, there's a tofu
burger in there for me.

22:32.252 --> 22:33.555
Thomas.

22:35.155 --> 22:36.324
What?

22:36.790 --> 22:38.727
You hate healthy food.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.329
They're leaving.

22:46.868 --> 22:49.406
I hate to eat and drive
at the same time.

22:49.470 --> 22:51.207
There is a definite change.

22:51.273 --> 22:54.947
Maybe you just never noticed
the mature side of me before.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.965
So? What do you think?
You want to buy the car?

23:43.364 --> 23:45.201
Yeah, I guess so.

23:45.266 --> 23:47.971
In that case,
the test drive is over.

23:48.036 --> 23:49.138
Yeah.

23:51.940 --> 23:53.643
Or maybe it isn't.

24:13.062 --> 24:17.871
Magnum, Magnum, wait a minute. You're
actually going to tell him about this guy?

24:17.934 --> 24:21.140
Don't you have any consideration
for his feelings?

24:25.708 --> 24:28.548
I got this picture
from a very trusted friend.

24:28.612 --> 24:30.949
The guy's name is Miguel Torres.

24:31.415 --> 24:35.222
Tanaka's contacts on the Mainland found
rap sheets in three different states.

24:35.285 --> 24:39.560
All of them confidence games, Higgins.
He finds widows. Retired people.

24:40.358 --> 24:43.263
Someone who's vulnerable
and wipes them out.

24:44.129 --> 24:48.505
Why are you telling me this? I don't
recall hiring you to find this man.

24:48.834 --> 24:52.308
The L.A. police think he was
working with an accomplice.

24:53.139 --> 24:54.942
A female accomplice.

24:56.442 --> 24:58.345
What is it, exactly,
you're trying to say?

24:58.411 --> 25:00.915
Higgins, you know
what I'm saying.

25:01.515 --> 25:04.955
I think you should consider that what you
are suggesting is the most vile kind

25:05.019 --> 25:06.454
of unfounded slander.

25:06.521 --> 25:09.593
I saw them together!
And they were real friendly.

25:09.657 --> 25:11.260
You've been spying on her?

25:11.325 --> 25:14.431
I'm sorry, Higgins, I'm sorry I have
to be the one to tell you this.

25:14.495 --> 25:17.267
But she's setting you up.
Can't you see?

25:17.733 --> 25:22.109
She gets your thinking all confused, she
gets your mind off your work at the estate,

25:22.171 --> 25:24.776
they find out where
all the valuables here are,

25:24.841 --> 25:28.815
and then they pick the perfect moment
to come in here and steal everything.

25:28.878 --> 25:30.848
You are making
a terrible mistake.

25:30.914 --> 25:34.756
Am I, Higgins? Take a look at yourself.
Take a good look,

25:34.818 --> 25:36.755
you've let everything
at the estate go to pot.

25:36.820 --> 25:39.559
The bills are piling up. The
maintenance program is falling apart.

25:39.623 --> 25:43.163
You haven't returned one phone call
from your publisher about your memoirs.

25:43.228 --> 25:46.100
You're doing everything you
can to avoid responsibility.

25:46.164 --> 25:52.043
Now if this keeps up, I'm afraid I'll
have no alternative but to call Robin.

25:52.805 --> 25:55.844
I see. So there is a Robin
Masters when you need him.

25:55.908 --> 25:58.680
I hope so, Higgins.
At this point, I hope so.

25:58.744 --> 26:00.714
Are you quite finished?

26:09.890 --> 26:12.997
I know, I know.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.517
A final thought
about tropical storms.

26:33.583 --> 26:36.989
No matter how many times you have to
go through them, you're still never

26:37.053 --> 26:40.493
quite prepared for it when
the next one comes around.

26:44.595 --> 26:50.606
"The desert storm engulfed us, dissecting
our spirits with sabers of sand

26:50.668 --> 26:52.538
"and chilling wind.

26:52.604 --> 26:57.146
"And through the storm thundered the
thousand sabers of Abdul Ben." No.

27:00.445 --> 27:03.050
No. Sabers don't thunder.

27:09.256 --> 27:11.259
Okay. How's this?

27:12.993 --> 27:17.669
"The desert storm
had us pinned down."

27:21.836 --> 27:24.875
"And our spirits,"

27:26.641 --> 27:29.313
"were low."

27:32.648 --> 27:33.950
"Low."

27:36.819 --> 27:38.122
Just low.

27:40.456 --> 27:45.366
"And we looked up
and saw a thousand..."

27:48.266 --> 27:49.769
"A thousand..."

27:52.670 --> 27:57.446
"A thousand big mean guys! And we were
creamed and we all got killed. The end!"

28:01.947 --> 28:02.982
Robin's Nest.

28:03.048 --> 28:06.188
Mr. Magnum? I had
an appointment with Jonathan.

28:06.252 --> 28:09.759
We were supposed to go over the
plans for the Regata Luncheon.

28:09.823 --> 28:13.430
It's practically upon us and
nothing has been finalized.

28:13.493 --> 28:16.098
Well, I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

28:16.596 --> 28:18.032
Do you think so?

28:18.099 --> 28:22.307
Uh-huh, yes. Uh, Darjeeling?
Or Earl Grey?

28:22.703 --> 28:24.473
Darjeeling, please.

28:26.607 --> 28:31.918
I did want to apologize for taking you
away from the Mendelssohn the other night.

28:31.980 --> 28:34.819
I could see how much you
were enjoying it.

28:35.985 --> 28:39.157
Well, Mendelssohn is
rather like a good cognac.

28:39.222 --> 28:42.362
One wants to savor it
in small amounts.

28:43.860 --> 28:46.065
Yes. I see your point.

28:48.332 --> 28:51.939
Does Jonathan seem
very preoccupied of late?

28:53.438 --> 28:56.710
I know it's none of my
business, but does he seem

28:56.774 --> 28:59.714
the slightest bit different
to you, somehow?

29:01.447 --> 29:03.751
We all go
through phases, Agatha.

29:04.250 --> 29:07.489
Yes, yes. You're quite right.

29:08.988 --> 29:11.626
Nothing to worry about then?

29:12.359 --> 29:13.928
Nothing at all.

29:21.134 --> 29:24.674
Astounding the way tea restores
one's spirits, isn't it?

29:25.373 --> 29:26.776
Yes, it is.

29:28.843 --> 29:33.385
Mr. Magnum, I hope you won't
find this inappropriate,

29:34.483 --> 29:37.823
but you have been looking
particularly well, lately.

29:39.988 --> 29:41.358
Thank you.

29:43.559 --> 29:46.832
And, you won't tell Jonathan
about our little chat?

29:54.405 --> 29:56.041
Thomas.

29:56.106 --> 29:58.611
Hi, I just, uh... So, did you...

30:00.512 --> 30:02.449
Did that name help you out any?

30:02.514 --> 30:06.288
, Yeah, it did, I mean,
it will I think.

30:07.485 --> 30:10.592
That's what I stopped by for,
to say thank you.

30:10.989 --> 30:13.895
For something that might
help you out, maybe?

30:14.527 --> 30:15.730
Right.

30:18.798 --> 30:22.405
There is something else
I want to talk to you about.

30:37.785 --> 30:39.588
Do you think I'm different?

30:39.654 --> 30:41.694
Why do guys always want to
know if they're different?

30:41.723 --> 30:44.763
No, I don't mean different
from other guys,

30:45.561 --> 30:47.966
I mean different
from me, lately.

30:49.098 --> 30:52.271
Do I seem different to you?

30:52.768 --> 30:53.904
Nah!

30:54.271 --> 30:55.272
Really?

30:56.106 --> 30:58.444
Maybe more, more you.

30:59.943 --> 31:01.246
More me?

31:02.179 --> 31:03.314
Yeah.

31:04.348 --> 31:05.851
Anything else?

31:10.589 --> 31:11.590
No.

31:20.699 --> 31:22.235
Very strange.

31:22.902 --> 31:25.507
Well, it's bad enough he's
making a fool of himself, but...

31:25.572 --> 31:26.573
But what?

31:26.639 --> 31:28.108
Nothing.

31:28.174 --> 31:30.846
Well, I just don't like to see
innocent people get hurt, that's all.

31:30.911 --> 31:31.912
Oh. Agatha.

31:31.979 --> 31:34.183
No, I didn't say
anything about Agatha.

31:34.248 --> 31:37.120
Thomas, I got that name for you.
It's Rosita Esteverdes.

31:37.184 --> 31:38.186
Thanks, Rick.

31:38.253 --> 31:41.225
I want you to know this is the very last
favor that I'm ever going to do for you.

31:41.289 --> 31:42.992
I've heard that before.

31:43.058 --> 31:46.230
No! I mean it this time. I don't
want to talk to those guys,

31:46.294 --> 31:49.167
and least of all I don't want
to'know any of those lowlifes

31:49.231 --> 31:50.833
that you always
have me call for you.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.002
Rick!

31:52.068 --> 31:55.274
Well, I'm serious. I'm a changed man.
I got new goals.

31:56.105 --> 31:57.975
New interests in life.

32:01.578 --> 32:04.518
Why do I get the feeling that
there's a woman behind all of this?

32:04.582 --> 32:06.117
Danielle. Danielle.

32:06.183 --> 32:07.886
Danielle. Danielle!

32:07.951 --> 32:10.056
Rick, there you are!

32:10.687 --> 32:11.790
Hello again.

32:11.856 --> 32:12.857
Hi.

32:12.924 --> 32:14.560
Are you coming to
the poetry reading with us?

32:14.626 --> 32:16.363
Uh, no. Um, Danielle.

32:16.428 --> 32:18.665
These guys aren't
interested in Yevtushenko.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.366
Yevtushenko?

32:20.432 --> 32:22.670
Oh, I'm sorry, T.C., Danielle.

32:22.735 --> 32:25.072
Oh, hi. I'm a big fan of
Yuri Yevtushenko. Hi.

32:25.137 --> 32:26.406
You're welcome
to join us if you like.

32:26.473 --> 32:30.180
Oh! He's teasing you. This guy's
got a great sense of humor.

32:30.944 --> 32:33.014
Come on. I want
to get a front row seat.

32:33.079 --> 32:34.382
Nice to meet you.

32:34.448 --> 32:38.489
Did you get a chance to read the debate between
William F. Buckley, Jr. and Carl Sagan?

32:38.552 --> 32:40.723
I skimmed it.
It was quite stimulating.

32:40.788 --> 32:42.658
What's wrong with that picture?

32:42.723 --> 32:45.243
I don't know, but she's the best
thing that ever happened to him.

32:45.293 --> 32:46.628
Listen, I gotta go.
I'll see you later...

32:46.695 --> 32:49.534
Oh, no! No! No! No! No! Don't
go, I, I ordered you a beer.

32:49.598 --> 32:52.805
Oh, uh, thanks, Kim.

32:53.469 --> 32:55.639
T.C., now that I've got a name,

32:56.172 --> 32:59.411
I can go back to the building where Higgins
picked up Rosita. I'll ask around.

32:59.475 --> 33:03.417
See who she works for. If anybody.
Look, somebody somewhere knows

33:03.480 --> 33:05.584
what she's up to
and I'm going to find them.

33:05.649 --> 33:08.554
You're sure going through a lot of trouble
for a client that didn't hire you.

33:08.619 --> 33:12.026
I mean, why are you so sure that she
is trying to run a con on Higgins?

33:12.089 --> 33:14.561
Well, I got kind of a knack
for reading people, T.C.

33:14.626 --> 33:19.302
No, now believe me, if Rosita
Esteverdes was legit I'd feel it.

33:19.364 --> 33:22.971
No! I can tell you right now what
I'll find at that office building.

33:23.034 --> 33:26.307
I'm going to find out that Rosita
Esteverdes, if she even works

33:26.372 --> 33:27.574
in the building at all,

33:27.640 --> 33:28.708
Aloha.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.111
Ís marking time as a file clerk or
something while she and her boyfriend

33:31.177 --> 33:33.882
hatch a plot to separate
Higgins from his money.

33:33.946 --> 33:36.251
That's what I'm going to find.

33:47.462 --> 33:49.265
Oh, my God!

33:51.632 --> 33:55.840
This is how you've been spending
your Tuesday afternoons?

33:55.902 --> 33:59.376
Really, Magnum, I would have
expected more discretion from you.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.545
Well, why didn't you tell me?

34:01.610 --> 34:06.286
If you had sought out this, this sort
of counseling, would you have told me?

34:06.348 --> 34:09.620
You mean about seeing a psychiatrist?
Of course, I would, Higgins.

34:09.686 --> 34:12.322
I would have told you.
If I had gone.

34:12.755 --> 34:15.860
Which I never would, I mean, not
that it's not okay for some people,

34:15.924 --> 34:21.235
but it's just something that I would
definitely not ever, even consider doing.

34:22.165 --> 34:25.272
And frankly I'm a little surprised that you
would do something like that, Higgins.

34:25.335 --> 34:28.074
Besides, what about the dancing
and the romantic luncheons.

34:28.139 --> 34:30.476
You gonna tell me
those were your sessions?

34:30.542 --> 34:34.349
Rosita, Dr. Esteverdes
was helping me...

34:35.347 --> 34:38.052
She was helping me
come out of my shell.

34:38.583 --> 34:41.088
She's a brilliant
psychotherapist with a rather,

34:41.152 --> 34:43.558
uh, avant-garde way of working.

34:45.525 --> 34:48.864
Why would you want to come
out of your shell, Higgins?

34:48.928 --> 34:52.000
It's a perfectly
comfortable, workable shell.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.804
It was a momentary
reaction to...

34:59.541 --> 35:00.776
To what?

35:01.476 --> 35:03.279
It's not really important.

35:03.344 --> 35:07.285
What is important is that I came here
to warn Rosita about this Miguel chap,

35:07.348 --> 35:09.653
and she's nearly three quarters of
an hour late for our appointment.

35:09.718 --> 35:11.621
That's very unlike her.

35:13.087 --> 35:16.294
You can't go in there!
That's her private office!

35:19.663 --> 35:22.335
Is this part of her
avant-garde style?

35:22.666 --> 35:23.734
No.

35:29.707 --> 35:31.944
She had a one o'clock
appointment.

35:32.008 --> 35:33.611
Miguel Torres.

35:36.447 --> 35:38.484
He's a patient of hers.

35:39.016 --> 35:41.019
This note's dated today.

35:41.085 --> 35:44.893
"The first time you eluded me. You
cannot escape from me so easily."

35:44.957 --> 35:47.528
"Once I have you, I will
never let you go. Miguel."

35:47.594 --> 35:49.965
A perfect example of
patient-therapist transference.

35:50.028 --> 35:52.433
Obviously he thinks
he's fallen in love with her.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.468
If he can't have her,
no one else can.

35:54.534 --> 35:55.702
Right.

35:56.102 --> 35:58.072
Where could he have taken her?

35:58.137 --> 36:00.542
Did she say anything
to you? Anything about him?

36:00.608 --> 36:02.043
Of course not. Never.

36:02.109 --> 36:04.213
Anything about places
she liked to go?

36:04.278 --> 36:05.914
A place that he might
know about?

36:05.980 --> 36:08.485
No. Only dancing. Wait a
minute, what did he say

36:08.550 --> 36:10.019
that night at Stage West?

36:11.620 --> 36:15.294
Or words to that effect. "You
aren't going to dance for him."

36:16.424 --> 36:17.693
The Club Del Mar Chino.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.663
I beg your pardon.
No it, it's a long shot.

36:19.729 --> 36:21.866
I know my hunches have been
off a little bit lately,

36:21.931 --> 36:26.106
but, Higgins, I think he's gonna keep
her where she can only dance for him.

36:27.471 --> 36:28.706
Stroke.

36:29.972 --> 36:31.175
Stroke.

36:32.209 --> 36:33.311
Stroke.

36:33.377 --> 36:34.980
Higgins, this is ridiculous.

36:35.045 --> 36:39.153
It's not ridiculous. He may have
armed guards at the front door.

36:59.606 --> 37:02.311
One should never underestimate
the element of surprise.

37:02.375 --> 37:05.782
Take for instance, Operation Hambone,
designed by Field Marshall Montgomery.

37:05.846 --> 37:07.148
Not now.

37:43.021 --> 37:44.056
Shh! What are...

37:44.121 --> 37:45.858
Shh! What are you doing?

37:45.924 --> 37:47.092
I thought you saw me.

37:47.157 --> 37:49.228
I'm sorry, Higgins,
I'm blind in that eye.

37:49.294 --> 37:51.564
Ever since that fight
in the warehouse.

37:51.629 --> 37:52.698
Magnum!

37:52.765 --> 37:56.238
I'm sure it's just a temporary condition.
That's all.

38:10.417 --> 38:12.889
Could somebody help me? Please!

38:12.954 --> 38:15.325
I'm coming for you, Rosita.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.226
Could somebody please help me?

38:47.324 --> 38:49.628
Don't worry, Rosita, we have
everything under control.

38:49.693 --> 38:51.764
What's going on here?

38:51.830 --> 38:54.067
Jonathan, what have
you done to him?

38:54.131 --> 38:56.336
Are you all right?

38:56.401 --> 38:58.772
Sure, sure, fine, fine.

38:58.837 --> 39:02.177
So where's the priest? Have
you attacked him as well?

39:29.204 --> 39:31.676
Oh, my God!

39:32.373 --> 39:35.813
I'm afraid there's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

39:36.312 --> 39:40.453
If there's anything I can do
to make it up to you?

39:52.530 --> 39:53.999
Mendelssohn.

40:19.292 --> 40:22.131
I guess I owe you
a big apology, Jonathan.

40:22.730 --> 40:26.137
You see, when Miguel was first
assigned to me as part of his parole,

40:26.201 --> 40:29.975
I got very confused. I could see
I was falling in love with him.

40:30.038 --> 40:32.576
I see.
Well, he made such progress.

40:32.641 --> 40:37.384
He completely overcame his compulsive
need to run confidence games on widows.

40:38.214 --> 40:41.955
Well, I got swept away. And we decided
to be married right here in the club,

40:42.018 --> 40:43.521
before it closed down.

40:43.586 --> 40:44.654
Hmm.

40:54.132 --> 40:56.636
But then, he became so jealous
of my other patients,

40:56.700 --> 40:59.172
that I got frightened. I broke
it off and had to run away

40:59.237 --> 41:00.907
from my passionate
feelings for him.

41:00.972 --> 41:02.975
Yes. And then you
came into my office

41:03.041 --> 41:05.379
and into my life.
And I got even more confused.

41:05.443 --> 41:07.748
I see. I guess I fell
into the classic

41:07.813 --> 41:10.985
patient-therapist transference
trap, only in reverse.

41:11.050 --> 41:14.056
Yes. I was trying to
help you, Jonathan,

41:14.120 --> 41:17.594
but actually, all I was trying
to do was turn you into Miguel.

41:17.657 --> 41:18.658
I see.

41:18.725 --> 41:22.499
Well, today, after Miguel and I
finished working out our aggressions,

41:22.562 --> 41:26.737
beating each other with the bataka
bats, I experienced the gestalt.

41:26.801 --> 41:27.936
Ah ha.

41:35.744 --> 41:38.749
I knew, I no longer had to run.

41:39.047 --> 41:42.220
I knew that I could
be married here in the club,

41:42.551 --> 41:44.822
even though it was closed down.

41:44.887 --> 41:45.989
Hmm.

41:49.993 --> 41:51.830
Do you have the ring?

42:18.658 --> 42:21.196
Thank you, Jonathan,
for talking to me.

42:21.261 --> 42:24.233
You really helped me break
through to my inner self.

42:24.297 --> 42:26.735
Do you give this woman
to this man?

42:28.802 --> 42:30.372
Ecstatically.

42:53.863 --> 42:56.133
What do you mean transference?

42:56.700 --> 43:02.846
Well according to Dr. Esteverdes,
some people have a strange reaction

43:02.907 --> 43:06.213
when someone close to them
dies, or, or almost dies.

43:06.777 --> 43:09.649
They can try to take on
that person's personality

43:09.714 --> 43:12.586
as a means of
trying to maintain control.

43:12.650 --> 43:14.921
It sounds pretty strange to me.

43:14.986 --> 43:18.360
Yes, well, I guess people
react in many different ways.

43:18.423 --> 43:20.560
That's exactly what I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

43:20.625 --> 43:24.734
Well, you can't really believe
all that psychoanalysis stuff.

43:24.797 --> 43:27.435
Like becoming
suddenly irresponsible.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.207
Or throwing yourself completely into
your work so that you don't have

43:31.271 --> 43:32.473
to deal with it.

43:32.538 --> 43:35.511
Well, not that I have anything
against analysis, per se...

43:35.576 --> 43:38.415
Like giving up poker games
for poetry readings.

43:38.479 --> 43:41.585
It's just not something that I
would ever consider doing myself.

43:41.648 --> 43:44.921
In other words, doing things
that really aren't you.

43:46.355 --> 43:48.960
Like buying a flashy sports car.

43:49.024 --> 43:50.827
Are you going
to buy Carol's old car?

43:50.893 --> 43:52.997
Oh, uh, she sold that
to someone else.

43:53.062 --> 43:56.736
She said she didn't want the sale of a
car to get in the way of our friendship.

43:56.799 --> 43:59.638
Well, perhaps it's just as well.

43:59.702 --> 44:02.474
You can't really afford
the down payment.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.275
What's this?

44:04.341 --> 44:09.485
J A bill from a Dr. Lawrence
Howlett Psychiatrist.

44:16.255 --> 44:17.523
For me?

44:18.623 --> 44:19.826
Must be some mistake.

44:19.892 --> 44:24.066
Yours. Apparently, you didn't realize that
you have to pay for parking in his building.

44:24.897 --> 44:26.367
I can explain.

44:27.133 --> 44:32.009
If you gentlemen will excuse me, I have to
pick up Agatha for the Regata Luncheon.

44:34.375 --> 44:35.410
I can explain.

44:35.476 --> 44:36.911
I gotta go.

44:37.577 --> 44:39.647
I got a lane reserved
at the Aloha Bowl.

44:39.712 --> 44:40.981
Hey, you want to go bowl
a few frames?

44:41.048 --> 44:42.684
No, I got to meet Danielle.

44:42.750 --> 44:46.357
No, wait. Let her meet me.
We'll go bowling for a change.

44:50.425 --> 44:51.661
Well...

44:52.428 --> 44:54.197
See you later, guys.

44:54.663 --> 44:56.833
Yeah, we'll see you, Thomas.

45:08.544 --> 45:10.548
And as for you, get lost.

45:11.582 --> 45:14.654
Hey, it looks like
you got your eyesight back!

45:16.154 --> 45:18.893
You said you'd see me
in 40 or 50 years.

45:19.490 --> 45:20.559
Mmm-hmm.

45:20.625 --> 45:22.094
So, beat it.

45:24.596 --> 45:26.833
That's all I needed to hear.
