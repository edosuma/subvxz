Welcome to tumbling class.

00:35.277 --> 00:36.535
Moms, please enjoy,

00:36.686 --> 00:39.187
while dads grumble
about how much the class costs.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.099
240 bucks for a mat and a room.

00:42.192 --> 00:43.375
Now let's all gather 'round

00:43.602 --> 00:46.003
because Stewie is gonna do
a somersault.

00:46.939 --> 00:49.048
(grunting)

00:55.556 --> 00:57.556
(groans) Nailed it.

00:57.707 --> 00:59.874
Well, that's basically fine,
and I don't honestly care,

00:59.968 --> 01:04.379
so unless there's an unexpected
appearance from a rival baby...

01:04.398 --> 01:06.973
Perhaps<i> I</i> could take a shot.

01:07.126 --> 01:08.141
-(gasps)
-It's Doug!

01:08.294 --> 01:09.568
That's Stewie's rival.

01:09.719 --> 01:10.977
What are you doing here, Doug?

01:11.130 --> 01:13.054
Eh, thought I'd give
this tumbling thing a try.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.740
So what do I do,
just fall down

01:14.967 --> 01:17.058
like literally anyone affected
by gravity?

01:17.078 --> 01:18.985
Um, there's a bit more to it
than that.

01:19.138 --> 01:20.746
One can't just show up
and hope to execute,

01:20.973 --> 01:22.456
say, a perfect somers...

01:23.733 --> 01:25.492
Oh, oh, he's very good!

01:25.586 --> 01:27.086
(cheering)

01:27.237 --> 01:28.903
Hmm. Something like that?

01:28.923 --> 01:30.814
-Wow!
-Now that's tumbling!

01:30.833 --> 01:33.317
Boys can be good at this till
nine, then the whispers start.

01:33.410 --> 01:35.243
Calm down,
it wasn't that great.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.654
Stewie, give Doug
your shirt and overalls.

01:37.673 --> 01:39.139
He's my son now.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.103
<i> ANNOUNCER: We now return</i>
<i> to Christopher Nolan's</i> Tenet.

01:44.254 --> 01:45.512
I'm already completely lost.

01:45.664 --> 01:48.923
Dad, can I ask you
something about girls?

01:49.017 --> 01:50.109
Are you wearing a wire?

01:50.336 --> 01:52.169
There's a girl in my class
I have a crush on,

01:52.262 --> 01:54.020
and I can't get her
to notice me.

01:54.115 --> 01:56.406
Ah, now I understand.

01:58.177 --> 02:00.010
Lucky for you,
there's a bunch of old movies

02:00.028 --> 02:01.511
on this very subject.

02:01.605 --> 02:03.347
Here.<i> Sixteen Candles.</i>

02:03.365 --> 02:05.349
<i> Can't Buy Me Love,</i>
<i> Say Anything...</i>

02:05.367 --> 02:07.960
all on very inconvenient VHS.

02:08.187 --> 02:10.871
VHS? What do those letters
stand for?

02:10.965 --> 02:13.206
That information has been lost
to history.

02:13.359 --> 02:14.967
Anyway, Chris,
just watch these movies

02:15.194 --> 02:17.361
and do what
the 28-year-old teenagers do.

02:17.379 --> 02:18.637
I guess I could try.

02:18.864 --> 02:22.366
After all, they tried to
do<i> Superman</i> in Boston once.

02:22.459 --> 02:25.535
I've noticed that you're never
around when Superman's here.

02:25.554 --> 02:27.220
Are... are you Superman?

02:27.373 --> 02:28.889
What is ya,
wacked in the head?

02:28.983 --> 02:31.224
I'm Clahk.
Plain ol' Clahk.

02:31.377 --> 02:33.819
Okay, back to
our Boston newspaper job.

02:34.046 --> 02:35.970
-(phone rings)
<i> -Spotlight.</i>

02:35.990 --> 02:37.531
What?!

02:41.978 --> 02:43.811
(gasping, murmuring)

02:43.873 --> 02:45.146
Show-and-tell time.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.166
Finally a chance
to reclaim my honor

02:47.317 --> 02:49.001
after that whole
tumbling fiasco.

02:49.228 --> 02:51.670
Next up for show-and-tell:
Stewie.

02:51.897 --> 02:53.130
Hello, everyone.

02:54.066 --> 02:55.340
This is a weird seashell

02:55.567 --> 02:57.584
that kind of looks
like female genitalia

02:57.678 --> 02:58.902
that my dad likes.

02:58.921 --> 03:00.404
Lois, where's my she shell?

03:00.497 --> 03:02.572
Oh, Stewie took it
to show-and-tell.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.908
Well, I hope no one puts it
to their ear.

03:04.927 --> 03:06.393
Incredible, right?

03:08.505 --> 03:10.022
(yawns)

03:10.840 --> 03:12.173
Thank you, Stewie.

03:12.193 --> 03:15.527
And, so you know, many
middle-aged women have seashells

03:15.679 --> 03:17.087
in their powder rooms.

03:17.105 --> 03:19.514
Okay,
next up is Doug.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.033
Hello, gang,

03:21.184 --> 03:24.110
and have I got
some show-and-tell for you.

03:24.263 --> 03:26.763
This is a ticket stub
from a PG movie

03:26.782 --> 03:28.615
that I got to see
in the theater...

03:28.767 --> 03:29.933
alone.

03:30.026 --> 03:31.210
KIDS:
Wow!

03:31.361 --> 03:34.104
Also, I've been on
a Disney cruise.

03:34.197 --> 03:36.048
Hey, who's this
in the picture with Moana?

03:36.199 --> 03:38.442
(chuckles):
Oh, me? Huh.

03:38.535 --> 03:41.127
-KID: No way!
-KID 2: Moana is famously
agoraphobic.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.780
Yes, but she's managing it
day by day,

03:43.799 --> 03:45.057
thanks to CBD oil.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.967
This cruise was a big step
for her.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.376
Okay,
I think we can all agree that

03:48.395 --> 03:49.877
these are very lame
show-and-tell...

03:49.897 --> 03:53.139
And finally, a piece of candy
from the London airport.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.809
(gasps) Aw, a Lion Bar?

03:55.961 --> 03:58.553
I'm sorry, did I say
"a piece of candy"?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.648
More like British candy
for the whole class!

04:01.800 --> 04:04.243
Drumstick Squashies
and rose-flavored wine gums

04:04.394 --> 04:06.303
-for everyone!
-(cheering)

04:06.396 --> 04:08.321
Hello, Show-and-Tell National
Championships

04:08.474 --> 04:11.992
in DeKalb, Illinois,
I have a nominee for you.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.644
Dammit. I'm sick of
being one-upped by Doug.

04:14.738 --> 04:15.921
Hurts.

04:16.072 --> 04:18.507
It hurts worse than a trip
to the barber shop.

04:19.651 --> 04:22.152
(screaming)

04:22.212 --> 04:25.180
This is what babies think
happens at haircuts!

04:28.084 --> 04:29.226
(knocking)

04:30.162 --> 04:32.012
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Burbeck.

04:32.164 --> 04:33.421
Do you have a daughter
named Jennifer,

04:33.515 --> 04:36.275
who is currently smeared
across Highway 9?

04:36.426 --> 04:37.334
Joe, it's us.

04:37.427 --> 04:39.336
Oh, sorry.
That's my next stop.

04:39.354 --> 04:42.005
Peter, your son was lurking
outside a classmate's window

04:42.024 --> 04:44.449
with this boom box,
playing Peter Gabriel.

04:44.601 --> 04:46.618
He's being charged
with felony stalking.

04:46.845 --> 04:49.863
I also tried to use science
to make a sex slave

04:50.015 --> 04:51.623
from a magazine photo.

04:51.775 --> 04:53.366
Oh, this is horrifying!

04:53.519 --> 04:55.852
-Actually, it's the '80s.
-What?

04:55.871 --> 04:58.188
Well, it appears that
someone has exposed your son

04:58.281 --> 05:02.617
to the very problematic
teen films of the 1980s.

05:03.244 --> 05:05.028
Peter, tell me it wasn't you.

05:05.047 --> 05:06.546
Honestly, Lois, I have no idea.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.715
My brain can't even
think thoughts no more

05:08.809 --> 05:10.976
-'cause of the Internet.
-Ugh, that's it.

05:11.127 --> 05:13.645
From now on,
you are an outside Peter.

05:13.797 --> 05:14.962
Go on! Get!

05:14.982 --> 05:16.540
(kissing noises) Outside!

05:16.633 --> 05:17.566
(grunts)

05:20.712 --> 05:23.405
Go to your Peter house.
Go to your Peter house!

05:26.994 --> 05:29.202
(thunder crashes)

05:36.411 --> 05:38.061
God, look at Doug over there,

05:38.154 --> 05:39.838
throwing a Frisbee
with the kindergarteners

05:39.989 --> 05:41.673
and a shorter-than-average
first-grader.

05:41.825 --> 05:43.508
-Thinks he's so cool.
-Yup.

05:43.735 --> 05:46.160
There must be some way
I can finally one-up that guy,

05:46.254 --> 05:48.363
and you're clearly looking
for cat turds right now.

05:48.365 --> 05:50.574
Yup. Y-- Huh?
Wait, uh, wait.

05:50.592 --> 05:53.426
-(sniffs) Aw, gum.
-Help me out, man.

05:53.579 --> 05:55.503
I need something to win back
everyone's attention.

05:55.597 --> 05:57.004
Wait, I know!

05:57.024 --> 05:59.006
What if I flip my eyelids
inside out?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.934
Show everyone what a freak I am.

06:01.086 --> 06:03.269
Huh? I could carve this out.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.863
Right?
This could be my thing.

06:05.014 --> 06:06.272
I don't think so, Stewie.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.034
All right, well what if I just,
like, do Doug's mom?

06:09.261 --> 06:11.203
Uh... Y-- I-I mean,
yeah, yeah, that--

06:11.430 --> 06:13.113
I mean, that would...
that would pretty much do it.

06:13.265 --> 06:15.432
Awesome! How do you dial a phone
or have sex?

06:15.450 --> 06:17.626
Or stand up
without using your hands?

06:20.530 --> 06:21.546
Let me tell you something,
Brian...

06:21.773 --> 06:23.673
(wind whistles)

06:29.539 --> 06:30.347
Oh, no!

06:31.617 --> 06:34.134
You said it,
relatively-short-first-grader.

06:34.286 --> 06:36.043
That Frisbee is way up there.

06:36.138 --> 06:38.288
I'm too scared
to climb up that high.

06:38.381 --> 06:40.548
Me, too,
average-height-kindergartener.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.809
That jungle gym dates back
to the 1930s,

06:42.961 --> 06:44.569
when the lives of children
were expendable.

06:44.721 --> 06:46.980
Someone would have to be crazy
to climb up there.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.222
STEWIE:
I'll do it.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.466
What?

06:49.484 --> 06:50.984
I'll climb up there
and get that Frisbee.

06:51.136 --> 06:53.078
Doug may be afraid,
but I'm not.

06:53.305 --> 06:55.472
Just give me a day
to get prepared and gear up,

06:55.490 --> 06:57.824
and at sunrise tomorrow,
I will climb up there

06:57.976 --> 06:59.309
and retrieve that Frisbee.

06:59.327 --> 07:01.311
Or we can ask Spider-Man
to do it.

07:01.329 --> 07:03.496
He came to my birthday party.
I know him.

07:03.649 --> 07:05.665
That wasn't the real Spider-Man.
That was your dad.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.093
We could see his hernia popping
through the suit.

07:08.244 --> 07:09.502
Hey, Tyler!

07:09.596 --> 07:12.097
Heard Spider-Man had a pretty
good time at your party.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.681
Don't mind me, Brian.
Just pushing the edge.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.090
Hmm.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.425
14 zippers, if you must know,

07:24.445 --> 07:26.169
but it's not about my pants,
Brian.

07:26.262 --> 07:28.171
It's about my fearlessness
and pants.

07:28.190 --> 07:29.448
Now, I need to plan out

07:29.599 --> 07:31.616
every last inch
of my climb tomorrow.

07:31.768 --> 07:33.952
If I do this right,
I'm gonna be remembered forever,

07:34.179 --> 07:36.270
like 9/11 was
for a few years.

07:36.364 --> 07:37.530
You're just climbing
a jungle gym.

07:37.683 --> 07:40.183
-It's not a big deal.
-Not a big deal?

07:40.185 --> 07:41.943
I pull this off,
I go down in history!

07:42.037 --> 07:45.297
Like my ancestor: The Guy Who
Was Hanged Next to Nathan Hale.

07:45.448 --> 07:50.043
I regret that I have but
one life to give for my country.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.212
If you kill me,
I'm gonna immediately void.

07:52.364 --> 07:55.699
All over here.
All over here.

07:55.717 --> 07:58.560
You, historian,
write down both our things.

08:02.465 --> 08:05.208
Hey, Lois, how about we get
a little three-way going?

08:05.301 --> 08:08.394
-You, me and the seashell?
-Oh, forget it, Peter.

08:08.547 --> 08:10.137
After that whole thing
with the '80s movies,

08:10.157 --> 08:11.472
I'm very upset with you.

08:11.566 --> 08:13.808
Well, can you use that anger
in the sex?

08:13.827 --> 08:17.554
No, Peter, your '80s nostalgia
isn't funny anymore.

08:17.572 --> 08:20.724
It's tired and worn out,
and borderline dangerous.

08:20.742 --> 08:23.243
I mean, those old references
just don't play

08:23.395 --> 08:26.153
-the same in today's world.
-What you talkin' 'bout, Lois?

08:26.173 --> 08:29.065
This! This is exactly
what I'm talking about!

08:29.158 --> 08:31.510
When are you gonna let
the '80s go?

08:31.661 --> 08:34.679
Never! The '80s will always be
the best decade.

08:34.831 --> 08:36.239
And I'm confident

08:36.258 --> 08:37.999
that non-whites and women
would agree with that.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.185
Everyone else, too.
And I'm gonna prove it.

08:40.412 --> 08:43.004
Family! Come here
conveniently fast, please!

08:43.098 --> 08:44.097
What is it, Peter?

08:44.249 --> 08:45.749
I have decided to prove
to you all

08:45.767 --> 08:48.360
that the '80s are still
relevant and hilarious.

08:48.511 --> 08:51.588
-But they're not.
-And in keeping
with the wonderful 1980s,

08:51.606 --> 08:54.181
I'm gonna go upstairs
and drill a hole in the wall

08:54.276 --> 08:55.683
to watch girls shower.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.370
Peter, in addition to
that being wildly problematic,

08:58.597 --> 09:01.188
you can't just drill a hole
in a structural wall.

09:01.283 --> 09:03.375
Do you even know
how to do that?

09:03.602 --> 09:07.045
Okay, that's one drywall bit,
one masonry bit,

09:07.196 --> 09:10.031
one spur point bit,
one tile bit,

09:10.125 --> 09:12.442
one drill with
a hammer action setting,

09:12.460 --> 09:15.111
one wire detector,
one stud finder,

09:15.130 --> 09:16.537
and one grease pencil.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.115
Sounds like someone's drilling
a hole in the wall

09:19.134 --> 09:20.466
to watch girls shower.

It's been an honor, friend.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.070
(both cry out)

19:59.440 --> 20:02.091
Oh. W-We weren't...
we weren't very high up there.

20:02.184 --> 20:04.593
No, I guess it just seemed
higher to us,

20:04.612 --> 20:06.871
because of perspective
and what-have-you.

20:07.098 --> 20:09.540
At any rate...
Hey, gang? Gang!

20:09.767 --> 20:10.766
Here's your Frisbee.

20:10.785 --> 20:13.436
Stewie and I got it...

20:13.454 --> 20:16.214
-together.
-Yes. Together.

20:16.441 --> 20:18.049
We're different kids
from before,

20:18.200 --> 20:20.426
so that means nothing to us.

20:26.634 --> 20:29.452
-We had quite the adventure.
-Yes, we did.

20:29.545 --> 20:31.395
And at the end of it all,
I, uh...

20:31.547 --> 20:32.879
I hope we've come
to see each other

20:32.974 --> 20:34.881
through slightly different eyes.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.400
We certainly have.

20:36.552 --> 20:37.643
Hey, who knows?

20:37.795 --> 20:39.987
Maybe someday they'll make
a movie about us.
