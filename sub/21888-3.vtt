gonna love it. -I will not.

I bought pink yesterday.

tell other people
what they need.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.773
Exactly.
It's-it's like when you decided

13:34.814 --> 13:38.652
you were gonna live here,

No, no, no, I'm just
touring the Middle East.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.237
-You?
-Oh, um...

15:46.279 --> 15:48.782
Why am I here? Um, I'm just
here 'cause my parent

15:48.823 --> 15:51.076

Um... do you want
to get a drink?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.128
There's a bar in the hotel.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.131
No, I try not to spend money
in Israel.

16:05.173 --> 16:06.132
Because of the boycott.

-Yeah.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.928

16:09.969 --> 16:11.846
Of course.

We can go Ramallah. I know
some really dope places there.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.727

-Yeah.

16:17.769 --> 16:18.978

definitely allowed.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.537
MAURA:
So I submit that misogyny

16:35.578 --> 16:37.372
was the reason Ethel Rosenberg

16:37.414 --> 16:40.625
became the focal point of such
an immense amount of hatred.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.961
Before the Cold War,
women were considered

16:43.002 --> 16:45.255
the holders of
the most positive virtues.

Ideas about goodness,
love and faith.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.886
But at this moment,
things shifted.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.722
For the first time,
here was a woman

16:53.763 --> 16:55.515
who was suspect.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.600
She ignited a deep-seated fear

16:57.642 --> 16:58.810
of betrayal.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.478
The idea of secrets leaking out

17:00.520 --> 17:04.441

woman, Jew.

-You're not nervous, are you?
-No.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.446
MAURA: The criminal charges
brought against her

17:09.487 --> 17:10.447
were dubious.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.450
But people wanted an enemy.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.326
-Are we gonna get stopped here?
-No.

who's going into the West Bank.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.873
They just want to know
who leaves.

a straight shot from here.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.587
are those all along the border?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.089
Habibti, what border?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.091
There is no actual

18:53.132 --> 18:55.051

30:12.686 --> 30:14.313
I'm serious.
This is, this is, this is...

30:14.355 --> 30:15.981
Come right now, period.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.442
Right now. Now.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.528

(laptop chimes)

30:21.862 --> 30:23.906
(over laptop):
Are you all right?

30:23.948 --> 30:25.533
-There was a bombing.
-No. Jesus.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.535
God, you scared me to death.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.328
Why would you call me
all the way from Israel

30:29.370 --> 30:31.080
-unless it was some kind of a
disaster? -Because I want to...

30:31.121 --> 30:32.456
I want to ask you a question.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.041
-What?
-All right.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.417
Our father is dead.

30:35.459 --> 30:36.585
Is that right?

30:36.627 --> 30:37.795
-Dead as disco.
-Right.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.964
And when did he die?

30:40.005 --> 30:41.423
In the '80s.

30:41.465 --> 30:42.967
Or the '90s.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.051
Uh-huh. Right.

30:44.093 --> 30:46.136
You don't know.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.263
Well, Mom said he died.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.640
Hmm. I want you to do me
a favor, all right?

30:49.682 --> 30:51.684
I want you to Google
something for me.

30:51.725 --> 30:54.436
