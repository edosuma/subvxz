02:35.062 --> 02:38.062
(suspenseful music)

02:54.920 --> 02:55.780
- [Radio Announcer] It has been confirmed

02:55.780 --> 02:57.800
that it was an apparent homicide.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.340
Sources also say the
residence was burglarized

03:00.340 --> 03:03.090
with most notable items
stolen being a clown costume

03:03.090 --> 03:04.220
and makeup kit.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.160
A neighbor is quoted as
saying the victim worked

03:06.160 --> 03:08.120
as a clown at children's parties.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.200
And finally, there is no
information at this time

03:10.200 --> 03:12.130
as to whether there is
any connection between

03:12.130 --> 03:15.210
this case and the escape
last week of a patient

03:15.210 --> 03:17.340
at Orchid Wood Psychiatric Ward.

03:17.340 --> 03:20.196
We now return you to your
regularly scheduled programing.

03:20.196 --> 03:22.863
(ominous music)

03:34.610 --> 03:37.293
- I've lived in Barnum all my life.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.593
It's been my whole world, you might say.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.890
Barnum can be a really nice place

03:45.210 --> 03:46.973
but it also has a darker side.

03:48.340 --> 03:51.333
Some strange things have
happened here over the years.

03:52.460 --> 03:56.640
One such tale involves a
rather sinister character

03:56.640 --> 04:01.640
masquerading as that most adored
of children's entertainers.

04:02.630 --> 04:03.803
A circus clown.

04:05.290 --> 04:07.820
Historically, clowns
have been a great source

04:07.820 --> 04:09.480
of fun and amusement.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.490
These zany court jesters have entertained

04:12.490 --> 04:14.923
both royalty and commoners alike.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.692
But clowns can have a dark side too.

04:19.740 --> 04:23.963
In fact, some clowns
can be downright deadly.

04:24.810 --> 04:28.660
Such is the case in a
sinister little story

04:28.660 --> 04:30.413
called "Die Laughing."

04:32.282 --> 04:35.032
(menacing music)

04:58.176 --> 05:00.180
(phone ringing)

05:00.180 --> 05:01.013
- Hello.

05:01.890 --> 05:04.603
Oh hi, babe, I was just
looking at your picture.

05:07.410 --> 05:09.110
No, I don't know if I got the job.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.630
Yeah, the interview went pretty well

05:12.630 --> 05:14.280
but they didn't make me an offer.

05:15.590 --> 05:17.440
They just said they'd get back to me.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.533
It's all so frustrating, lately.

05:21.810 --> 05:24.380
Don't worry about me,
though, I'll be all right.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.773
Things have to turn around
eventually, don't they?

05:27.850 --> 05:30.700
Miss Rusa is just a mean old
bat is all it comes down to.

05:32.520 --> 05:33.793
So how did your trip go?

05:35.660 --> 05:37.563
Are you going to be getting home today?

05:38.870 --> 05:40.383
I can't wait to see you.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.738
Well come by if it's not too late.

05:43.738 --> 05:46.405
(ominous music)

05:50.170 --> 05:51.003
Okay.

05:52.070 --> 05:52.903
Love you.

05:53.860 --> 05:54.693
Bye.

06:00.136 --> 06:02.386
(knocking)

06:04.350 --> 06:07.130
Miss Rusa, what a pleasant surprise.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.820
- You can skip the niceties, sweetie.

06:08.820 --> 06:10.920
Do you have the rent for me yet?

06:10.920 --> 06:13.972
- No, not yet but I'll
have it for you real soon.

06:13.972 --> 06:15.960
I just need a little more time.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.480
I'm between jobs right now.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.340
- You know, there are other people

06:19.340 --> 06:20.810
I could rent this place to.

06:20.810 --> 06:23.770
This is a good location and
I got people interested.

06:23.770 --> 06:24.920
I want my money,

06:24.920 --> 06:27.470
otherwise you better start
looking for a new place.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.840
Understood?

06:28.840 --> 06:29.673
- Understood.

06:29.673 --> 06:31.770
- I better be hearing
from you soon, missy.

06:31.770 --> 06:32.603
- You will.

06:46.550 --> 06:48.480
- I want these yards cleaned up good!

06:48.480 --> 06:50.600
They're both a mess, understand?

06:50.600 --> 06:51.792
- You got it, Miss Rusa.

06:51.792 --> 06:52.625
- Good.

06:52.625 --> 06:55.020
For what I'm paying you
fellas, you better have it!

06:55.020 --> 06:56.830
It's highway robbery, if you ask me.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.740
- Don't worry, Miss Rusa,
you'll get your money's worth.

06:58.740 --> 06:59.663
- I better.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.360
- What a grouch.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.550
- You said it, Bill.

07:06.550 --> 07:08.630
Well, I guess we better get to work.

07:08.630 --> 07:09.463
- Yup.

07:12.941 --> 07:15.858
(thunder rumbling)

07:20.400 --> 07:21.233
- Hey, you!

07:21.233 --> 07:23.145
What're you doing back there?

07:23.145 --> 07:25.812
(ominous music)

07:26.695 --> 07:27.768
You def?

07:27.768 --> 07:29.950
I said, what're you doing back there?

07:32.404 --> 07:35.154
(sinister music)

07:38.534 --> 07:40.367
Hey, get out of there!

07:48.090 --> 07:48.923
- [Man] Hello?

07:49.850 --> 07:51.120
Hello, anyone home?

07:51.120 --> 07:52.470
- Yes.

07:52.470 --> 07:53.377
- [Man] Just letting you know,

07:53.377 --> 07:55.577
we're gonna be out here
working on the yard.

09:04.605 --> 09:07.772
(car engine rumbling)

09:16.453 --> 09:19.685
(sinister music)

09:19.685 --> 09:21.935
(giggling)

09:24.180 --> 09:25.013
- Joe?

09:26.610 --> 09:28.493
Hey, Joe, you still out here?

09:32.210 --> 09:34.110
You better not have knocked off early.

09:39.530 --> 09:42.623
Miss Rusa will chew us out
if it's not finished today.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.053
And we need this job.

09:46.951 --> 09:49.618
(ominous music)

09:53.360 --> 09:54.193
Joe!

10:05.410 --> 10:07.660
(groaning)

10:12.038 --> 10:13.737
(squelching)

10:13.737 --> 10:15.904
(gagging)

10:43.489 --> 10:46.406
(foreboding music)

11:30.729 --> 11:32.389
(screaming)

11:32.389 --> 11:35.056

11:43.666 --> 11:46.166

11:50.013 --> 11:52.263

12:03.709 --> 12:06.709

12:13.178 --> 12:15.511

12:22.531 --> 12:24.781
(laughing)

12:38.786 --> 12:40.906
(groaning)

12:40.906 --> 12:43.906
(suspenseful music)

12:47.905 --> 12:48.738
- Johnny!

12:52.503 --> 12:53.336
- Run!

13:00.587 --> 13:03.587
(suspenseful music)

13:05.925 --> 13:07.049
- Miss Rusa!

13:07.049 --> 13:07.882
Miss Rusa!

13:12.949 --> 13:15.699
(menacing music)

13:23.383 --> 13:24.216
- No!

13:28.185 --> 13:30.216
(squelching)

13:30.216 --> 13:32.466
(giggling)

13:37.732 --> 13:39.982

14:57.756 --> 15:00.756
(suspenseful music)

15:09.662 --> 15:12.329
(ominous music)

15:29.490 --> 15:32.070
- Hey, Lisa, it's Shawn.

15:32.070 --> 15:34.210
I have bad news.

15:34.210 --> 15:36.373
I'm stuck on the side of the road.

15:37.310 --> 15:38.950
My car broke down.

15:38.950 --> 15:40.753
I believe I'm on Route Two.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.950
Could you do me a favor, though?

15:43.950 --> 15:45.810
Could you call the
Williamsons and tell them

15:45.810 --> 15:47.330
I'll just be a little bit late?

15:47.330 --> 15:49.300
I'm waiting for the tow truck.

15:49.300 --> 15:52.550
But make sure to tell them
that Buzbo will be there.

15:52.550 --> 15:53.383
All right.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.203
Okay.

15:55.203 --> 15:56.550
All right, thank you.

16:09.292 --> 16:11.959
(ominous music)

16:35.907 --> 16:38.014
(groaning)

16:38.014 --> 16:41.014
(suspenseful music)

16:44.310 --> 16:45.958

16:49.061 --> 16:51.219

16:51.219 --> 16:53.636
(whimpering)

16:58.307 --> 17:00.974
(ominous music)

17:06.059 --> 17:08.809
(birds chirping)

17:26.940 --> 17:29.440
(eerie music)

17:32.495 --> 17:33.328
- Oh!

17:35.190 --> 17:37.273
(crying)

17:47.730 --> 17:50.493
- [Man On TV] Let me guess,
wild turkey on the rocks?

17:51.500 --> 17:53.860
- Well, no, I'll just
have a Shirley Temple.

17:53.860 --> 17:58.357
- [Man On TV] You know what
they say, if you don't drink--

18:00.290 --> 18:02.660
- People love movies.

18:02.660 --> 18:05.190
They provides a voyeuristic escape

18:05.190 --> 18:07.853
that just can't be found elsewhere.

18:09.010 --> 18:10.913
People love their movie stars too.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.173
Especially those from the past.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.630
But it can all become too easy

18:17.630 --> 18:21.170
to get wrapped up in cinematic fantasies.

18:21.170 --> 18:23.830
That's the case in a twisted little tale

18:23.830 --> 18:25.493
called "The Horror Hostess."

18:27.306 --> 18:30.306
(somber jazz music)

19:36.111 --> 19:37.720
(phone ringing)

19:37.720 --> 19:39.620
(music muting)

19:39.620 --> 19:40.453
- Hello.

19:41.710 --> 19:42.543
Oh hey!

19:43.460 --> 19:45.370
Yeah, I'm getting ready now.

19:45.370 --> 19:47.650
I'll see you in about an hour.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.560
Okay, thanks, bye.

19:51.365 --> 19:54.282
(faint jazz music)

19:57.635 --> 19:59.750
- Just a few more spots.

19:59.750 --> 20:00.903
- Sure thing, hun.

20:01.880 --> 20:02.870
- I can't tell you how much

20:02.870 --> 20:05.440
I appreciate this opportunity, Jeana.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.900
It means so much to me.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.155
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

20:09.155 --> 20:13.053
I only wish I could pay you a
proper makeup artist salary.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.240
You do good work, Katie.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.400
- Thanks.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.870
I really mean it.

20:18.870 --> 20:20.920
Just to get a foot in the door.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.620
I love the horror genre.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.876
- Well that makes two of us.

20:24.876 --> 20:27.000
(faint jazz music)

20:27.000 --> 20:30.123
- So cool, even just to
be a small part of it.

20:31.325 --> 20:33.230
There you go, all done.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.063
- Great.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.860
- Oh, I gotta get to class.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.650
I gotta be there in 20 minutes.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.120
Good luck with the show today

20:40.120 --> 20:42.320
and I hope you have a
really exciting interview.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.520
- Oh, thank you so much.

20:47.532 --> 20:50.431
(door closing)

20:50.431 --> 20:53.790
(crickets chirping)

20:53.790 --> 20:56.540

24:39.340 --> 24:41.507

25:32.830 --> 25:35.580
(sinister music)

25:37.313 --> 25:39.646
(screaming)

25:43.750 --> 25:45.282
(swishing)

25:45.282 --> 25:46.483
- And there you have it.

25:46.483 --> 25:48.610
That was a scene from "Technopath,"

25:48.610 --> 25:50.990
the new stalker movie
starring tonight's guest

25:50.990 --> 25:52.210
at the Horror Pad,

25:52.210 --> 25:54.620
scream queen extraordinaire,

25:54.620 --> 25:56.393
Rebecca Blaze!

25:58.810 --> 26:01.020
So how are you doing tonight, Rebecca?

26:01.020 --> 26:01.853
- Excellent.

26:01.853 --> 26:03.400
Thanks for having me on the show, Jeana.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.390
- Oh, that clip was so exciting.

26:06.390 --> 26:09.100
Tell us a little more about "Technopath."

26:09.100 --> 26:11.480
- Oh, it's a cool little slasher movie

26:11.480 --> 26:15.853
about a psychotic maniac
stalking young coeds.

26:15.853 --> 26:18.760
Great special effects, great cast.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.900
The fans are going to love it.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.450
- Well you certainly have become

26:23.450 --> 26:26.820
a real fan favorite in the genre.

26:26.820 --> 26:29.570
Horror has been good to you, hasn't it?

26:29.570 --> 26:31.453
- Oh yes, it has.

26:32.690 --> 26:35.380
The fans are amazing.

26:35.380 --> 26:38.100
I don't know where I
would be without them.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.073
I do it all for the fans.

26:42.190 --> 26:44.190
- Well, right now, we have another treat

26:44.190 --> 26:46.410
for all you fright fans out there,

26:46.410 --> 26:50.070
a clip from the indie horror
flick, "Blood Carousel,"

26:50.070 --> 26:53.840
starring my extra special
guest, Rebecca Blaze!

26:53.840 --> 26:54.993
Enjoy!

26:56.290 --> 26:57.693
- And we're out.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.480
- Thanks again for doing the show.

27:03.480 --> 27:04.640
- Of course.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.940
- We have just a couple more
questions after the clip

27:06.940 --> 27:08.060
and that will be it.

27:08.060 --> 27:08.930
- Cool.

27:08.930 --> 27:09.763
- Although,

27:10.670 --> 27:14.080
if you could hang around
for awhile after the taping,

27:14.080 --> 27:16.450
I'd love to pick your brain some more.

27:16.450 --> 27:17.750
- Sure, why not?

27:17.750 --> 27:18.583
- Oh, great.

27:19.683 --> 27:22.183
(eerie music)

27:28.840 --> 27:30.692
Care for a refill, hun?

27:30.692 --> 27:31.525
- Sure.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.918
- To the horror genre.

27:43.918 --> 27:46.585
(ominous music)

27:52.940 --> 27:56.053
I love classic horror
from back in the day.

27:57.550 --> 28:00.803
Those fright film stars were great.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.483
Such elegant men and women.

28:05.915 --> 28:09.440
They exuded and amazing onscreen radiance

28:09.440 --> 28:13.150
which gave the genre
that intangible quality

28:13.150 --> 28:15.573
that can't be found anywhere else.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.610
Of course, today's cinema is great too.

28:19.610 --> 28:23.693
I mean, I can't wait to see
"Technopath" in its entirety.

28:23.693 --> 28:25.174
(chuckling)

28:25.174 --> 28:27.818
- Well between you and me,

28:27.818 --> 28:30.503
it's actually pretty stupid.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.090
(laughing)

28:33.090 --> 28:38.047
I just run around and
scream and show some skin.

28:38.047 --> 28:39.480
(laughing)

28:39.480 --> 28:42.351
It's just your standard T and A flick.

28:42.351 --> 28:45.853
But it should be enough
to impress the simpletons.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.353
- Simpletons?

28:49.430 --> 28:50.990
- Yeah, you know.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.363
My fans.

28:53.890 --> 28:57.281
- But you said you owed it all to them.

28:57.281 --> 28:58.360
(laughing)

28:58.360 --> 28:59.223
- I do.

29:00.610 --> 29:04.080
They're the ones that
keep buying the crap.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.790
(laughing)

29:06.790 --> 29:09.010
- Care for another drink, hun?

29:09.010 --> 29:11.027
(giggling)

29:11.027 --> 29:13.694
(ominous music)

29:17.470 --> 29:18.524
- Hey.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.350
I was drinking that.

29:20.350 --> 29:23.133
- I think you've had
quite enough, young lady.

29:25.650 --> 29:29.190
You know, if there's
one thing I can't stand,

29:29.190 --> 29:31.130
it's a phony.

29:31.130 --> 29:32.400
- What?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.660
- A phony.

29:33.660 --> 29:36.110
Someone who pretends to be one thing,

29:36.110 --> 29:39.690
but in reality is the exact opposite.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.510
- Who are you calling a phony?

29:42.510 --> 29:44.480
- Why you, dear.

29:44.480 --> 29:48.270
You have absolutely no
respect for the horror genre

29:48.270 --> 29:50.730
or its fans.

29:50.730 --> 29:53.173
You should be ashamed of yourself.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.760
- Listen, bitch,

29:58.760 --> 30:03.353
I worked my ass off to get where I am.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.670
I don't have to take any crap from any

30:06.670 --> 30:08.960
low rent Elvira wannabe.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.360
- Now, now, dear, temper, temper.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.160
And no name-calling, young lady.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.211
- That's it.

30:16.211 --> 30:17.730
I'm out of here.

30:20.620 --> 30:22.940
- Oh, no, no, no, dear.

30:22.940 --> 30:24.820
I can't let you leave.

30:24.820 --> 30:26.550
Not now.

30:26.550 --> 30:28.250
- What did you say?

30:28.250 --> 30:32.820
- I said, I can't let you leave now.

30:32.820 --> 30:34.033
- Screw you, bitch!

30:36.398 --> 30:39.400
(ominous music)

30:39.400 --> 30:40.587
What?

30:40.587 --> 30:41.747
- Well, hello gain.

30:41.747 --> 30:44.510
You know, I really love the horror genre

30:44.510 --> 30:46.733
far too much to let you go.

30:47.636 --> 30:49.580
- What're you talking about?

30:49.580 --> 30:53.810
- Oh, you really wouldn't
understand, you silly little tart.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.860
It really is the purest art form,

30:56.860 --> 31:01.860
exploring the depths of fear,
terror and the human soul.

31:02.750 --> 31:04.053
- You're crazy.

31:06.057 --> 31:08.100
(eerie music)

31:08.100 --> 31:10.863
Bitch, you spiked my drink.

31:12.530 --> 31:15.360
- Now why would I do that?

31:16.283 --> 31:18.950
(ominous music)

31:23.436 --> 31:26.519
(heartbeat thumping)

31:29.767 --> 31:31.934
(gasping)

31:33.473 --> 31:36.455
(screaming)

31:36.455 --> 31:39.506
Now that's a real horror scream.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.589
Definitely your best yet.

31:42.696 --> 31:45.274
(ominous music)

31:45.274 --> 31:46.778
(yelping)

31:46.778 --> 31:49.195
(squelching)

31:50.401 --> 31:52.568
(gagging)

31:56.788 --> 31:59.288
(eerie music)

32:01.650 --> 32:03.900
(growling)

32:06.053 --> 32:09.136
(heartbeat thumping)

32:15.234 --> 32:17.734
(eerie music)

32:37.333 --> 32:39.743
(faint jazz music)

32:39.743 --> 32:42.570
- There you go, as gorgeous as always.

32:42.570 --> 32:44.023
- Oh, thank you, Katie.

32:45.980 --> 32:47.240
- I gotta cruise.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.740
- Oh, late for another class?

32:48.740 --> 32:50.263
- I will be if I don't hurry.

32:51.926 --> 32:55.080
Hey, how'd that interview
go with that actress?

32:55.080 --> 32:56.570
Rebecca Blaze.

32:56.570 --> 32:59.620
- Actually, she was quite a letdown.

32:59.620 --> 33:01.510
That woman just didn't have the passion

33:01.510 --> 33:02.760
that she should've had.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.750
- That sucks.

33:03.750 --> 33:05.210
- Yeah, it does.

33:05.210 --> 33:07.110
But on the bright side,

33:07.110 --> 33:09.680
I came up with a whole new show intro.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.350
It's a real scream.

33:11.350 --> 33:12.310
- Cool.

33:12.310 --> 33:13.730
Can't wait to see it.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.499
I'll see you later.

33:15.499 --> 33:18.416
(faint jazz music)

33:27.160 --> 33:29.660
(eerie music)

33:41.138 --> 33:43.471
(screaming)

33:46.669 --> 33:49.169
(eerie music)

33:53.550 --> 33:55.683
- Nature has a way of being evil.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.570
Take the Venus flytrap for example,

33:59.570 --> 34:01.823
where it devours its prey.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.810
Man hasn't been kind to nature, though,

34:05.810 --> 34:08.600
with chemicals and what have you.

34:08.600 --> 34:13.600
This time, nature strikes
back in a nasty way

34:13.670 --> 34:16.306
in a story called, "The Bad Flower."

34:17.570 --> 34:20.152
(somber music)

34:23.295 --> 34:26.045
(birds chirping)

34:49.053 --> 34:51.303
- There, that should do it.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.650
Oh no.

34:53.650 --> 34:54.683
What have I done?

34:56.530 --> 34:58.690
I can't believe I mixed
Venus flytrap seeds

34:58.690 --> 34:59.740
with sunflower seeds.

35:00.820 --> 35:02.983
Oh well, it won't harm anything.

35:07.401 --> 35:10.068
(ominous music)

35:26.822 --> 35:29.989
(distant dog barking)

35:31.141 --> 35:33.891
(birds chirping)

35:36.379 --> 35:38.296
- Damn big ugly things.

35:39.150 --> 35:41.690
Why anyone would want to
plant such a freaky thing

35:41.690 --> 35:42.603
is beyond me.

35:46.010 --> 35:49.684
Maybe they'd like a little
taste of my weed killer.

35:49.684 --> 35:52.351
(ominous music)

35:53.610 --> 35:55.173
- What do you think you're doing?!

35:55.173 --> 35:56.762
You're killing my plants!

35:56.762 --> 35:57.876
Stop it!

35:57.876 --> 35:58.709
Stop it!

35:58.709 --> 36:00.420
- Get your hands off of me!

36:00.420 --> 36:03.080
Those plants are blocking
the sunlight to my plants,

36:03.080 --> 36:05.040
so they deserve to die!

36:05.040 --> 36:06.960
Why do you grow such ugly things anyway?

36:06.960 --> 36:08.520
- Those are my plants!

36:08.520 --> 36:10.280
You can't do this!

36:10.280 --> 36:13.090
- As far as I'm concerned,
they are on my property

36:13.090 --> 36:14.980
blocking the sun to my plants,

36:14.980 --> 36:17.186
so back off!

36:17.186 --> 36:18.436
- I said, stop!

36:20.766 --> 36:22.689
- I warned you.

36:22.689 --> 36:24.347
(gasping)

36:24.347 --> 36:25.643
(whimpering)

36:25.643 --> 36:27.201
- How could you?

36:27.201 --> 36:28.368
How could you?

36:30.629 --> 36:34.042
- Maybe next time you'll
learn not to mess with me.

36:34.042 --> 36:36.942
And get rid of those
damn things before I do.

36:36.942 --> 36:39.025
(crying)

36:40.155 --> 36:42.468
(dramatic music)

36:42.468 --> 36:45.120
- I'm so sorry she hurt you.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.733
I tried to stop her.

36:48.528 --> 36:49.361
She's so mean.

36:50.797 --> 36:53.243
I hope she gets what she deserves.

36:57.013 --> 36:59.763
(birds chirping)

37:13.669 --> 37:16.336
(ominous music)

37:24.897 --> 37:27.397
(eerie music)

37:49.254 --> 37:51.921
(ominous music)

38:02.441 --> 38:05.358
(thunder rumbling)

38:08.850 --> 38:11.350
(eerie music)

38:19.912 --> 38:22.662
(menacing music)

38:24.262 --> 38:26.429
(gagging)

38:37.144 --> 38:39.875
(screaming)

38:39.875 --> 38:42.662
(ominous music)

38:42.662 --> 38:46.284
(leaves rustling)

38:46.284 --> 38:47.700
Oh no.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.210
My big sunflower's gone.

38:50.210 --> 38:51.633
What happened to it?

38:58.590 --> 38:59.730
Thorn.

38:59.730 --> 39:02.010
I should've guessed.

39:02.010 --> 39:04.640
This time she's gone too far.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.583
It's time I paid her a visit.

39:11.501 --> 39:14.273
- Carolyn?

39:14.273 --> 39:15.106
Carolyn?

39:17.800 --> 39:20.292
Maybe she's in the garden.

39:20.292 --> 39:21.125
Carolyn?

39:23.369 --> 39:24.452
Hey, Carolyn.

39:28.886 --> 39:31.553
(ominous music)

39:44.443 --> 39:46.943
(eerie music)

39:56.774 --> 39:59.524
(birds chirping)

40:06.614 --> 40:08.314
(screaming)

40:08.314 --> 40:11.393
(menacing music)

40:11.393 --> 40:14.393
(suspenseful music)

41:04.373 --> 41:07.040
(ominous music)

41:40.292 --> 41:43.292
(suspenseful music)

41:45.698 --> 41:47.948
(groaning)

41:50.100 --> 41:53.060
- Yes, I'm working on the
account right now, sir.

41:53.060 --> 41:55.300
I'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

41:55.300 --> 41:56.830
What's that?

41:56.830 --> 41:58.610
Oh yes, the changes have been made.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.333
Just the way you ask for them.

42:01.230 --> 42:02.633
Okay, sir, take care.

42:04.780 --> 42:05.613
Jerk.

42:10.747 --> 42:13.576
(ominous music)

42:13.576 --> 42:16.243
(door clicking)

42:23.820 --> 42:24.653
Hello?

42:41.490 --> 42:42.323
Hmm.

42:51.457 --> 42:53.046
Nah.

42:53.046 --> 42:55.379
I think it's time for a nap.

43:00.234 --> 43:02.901
(ominous music)

43:11.231 --> 43:14.064
(leaves rustling)

43:21.541 --> 43:24.041
(eerie music)

43:39.037 --> 43:41.977
(gasping)

43:41.977 --> 43:43.502
(groaning)

43:43.502 --> 43:44.658
Plants!

43:44.658 --> 43:45.491
Plants!

43:45.491 --> 43:48.008
(coughing)

43:48.008 --> 43:48.841
Help me!

43:50.084 --> 43:52.076
I can't breathe.

43:52.076 --> 43:53.943
(coughing)

43:53.943 --> 43:56.248
(menacing music)

43:56.248 --> 43:57.876
Choking!

43:57.876 --> 44:00.043
(gagging)

44:00.900 --> 44:03.567
(ominous music)

44:06.033 --> 44:07.412
(thudding)

44:07.412 --> 44:08.248
(glass shattering)

44:08.248 --> 44:10.581
(screaming)

44:21.639 --> 44:24.139
(eerie music)

44:25.637 --> 44:27.720
- What the hell was that?

44:39.243 --> 44:40.877
A walking plant?

44:40.877 --> 44:43.377
(eerie music)

44:44.931 --> 44:46.633
Who's gonna believe me?

44:48.220 --> 44:50.563
No more stopping at the bar after work.

45:02.582 --> 45:05.249
(ominous music)

45:06.287 --> 45:09.287
(suspenseful music)

45:12.200 --> 45:14.367
(gagging)

45:25.171 --> 45:26.004
No!

45:26.004 --> 45:26.837
No!

45:28.124 --> 45:29.573
(groaning)

45:29.573 --> 45:30.827
No.

45:30.827 --> 45:32.290
No!

45:32.290 --> 45:34.540
(groaning)

45:38.343 --> 45:40.593
(coughing)

45:44.584 --> 45:47.334
(birds chirping)

45:53.800 --> 45:54.920
- Can't believe there have now been

45:54.920 --> 45:56.680
four murders in this town.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.470
- And to think, the
first one was right here

45:58.470 --> 46:00.100
in my own backyard.

46:00.100 --> 46:01.840
It scares me.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.870
- I know but you know as well as I do

46:03.870 --> 46:05.230
that Mrs. Thorn deserved it.

46:05.230 --> 46:07.480
- Oh Cindy, even Mrs. Thorn

46:07.480 --> 46:09.910
doesn't deserve to die like that.

46:09.910 --> 46:13.540
- After what that which did
to you, you're just too nice.

46:13.540 --> 46:15.490
- But those terrible murders.

46:15.490 --> 46:18.120
That poor guy playing basketball.

46:18.120 --> 46:19.930
I hope they catch the killer soon.

46:19.930 --> 46:21.660
I'm afraid to even come out here

46:21.660 --> 46:24.630
and sit in my own garden for very long.

46:24.630 --> 46:25.800
- Speaking of your garden,

46:25.800 --> 46:28.440
did you ever find that plant
that Mrs. Thorn ripped out?

46:28.440 --> 46:30.588
- Oh, you mean my nice, big sunflower?

46:30.588 --> 46:32.530
No, I never saw it again.

46:32.530 --> 46:34.980
- I remember when you
first started growing that.

46:36.970 --> 46:37.950
- What is it?

46:37.950 --> 46:39.086
Cindy, what's the matter?

46:39.086 --> 46:41.740
- That sunflower,

46:41.740 --> 46:43.420
I thought you said it was gone.

46:43.420 --> 46:45.330
- It is gone, Cindy.

46:45.330 --> 46:46.820
- Turn around.

46:46.820 --> 46:48.640
- Cindy, stop playing games.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.603
- Turn around.

46:50.770 --> 46:52.656
- I don't believe it.

46:52.656 --> 46:55.323
(ominous music)

46:57.150 --> 46:58.483
I just don't believe it.

47:00.380 --> 47:01.623
It's been gone.

47:03.140 --> 47:05.970
Now it looks like it
was never even dug up.

47:05.970 --> 47:08.320
- Maybe someone's trying
to play a joke on you.

47:09.970 --> 47:12.080
- But the only one who
would do something like that

47:12.080 --> 47:15.003
is Mrs. Thorn and she's dead.

47:16.980 --> 47:18.283
- I don't understand it.

47:25.190 --> 47:27.770
- I have to go in for a
minute, do you want anything?

47:27.770 --> 47:29.480
- No thanks, I'm fine.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.180
- Okay, I'll be right back.

47:32.354 --> 47:35.104
(birds chirping)

47:37.927 --> 47:40.594
(ominous music)

47:54.172 --> 47:57.172
(suspenseful music)

48:03.409 --> 48:06.242
(leaves rustling)

48:11.601 --> 48:13.851
(groaning)

48:16.351 --> 48:19.351
(suspenseful music)

48:29.683 --> 48:32.350
(ominous music)

48:35.061 --> 48:37.311
(coughing)

48:39.046 --> 48:40.536
- Carolyn!

48:40.536 --> 48:41.665
Help!

48:41.665 --> 48:42.498
Carolyn!

48:45.663 --> 48:46.496
- Cindy?

48:47.572 --> 48:48.905
- Carolyn, help!

48:50.233 --> 48:51.431
Help!

48:51.431 --> 48:52.264
Carolyn!

48:53.772 --> 48:55.337
Carolyn, help!

48:55.337 --> 48:56.650
- Stop!
(screeching)

48:56.650 --> 48:58.637
Stop, you're killing her!

48:58.637 --> 49:01.304
(ominous music)

49:06.829 --> 49:08.961
(coughing)

49:08.961 --> 49:10.490
Cindy, are you okay?

49:10.490 --> 49:11.371
Are you all right?

49:11.371 --> 49:13.196
- I'll be okay.

49:13.196 --> 49:14.029
(gasping)

49:14.029 --> 49:14.862
- Oh no!

49:16.182 --> 49:18.010
(screeching)

49:18.010 --> 49:18.880
Your lighter!

49:18.880 --> 49:20.300
Cindy, where's your lighter?

49:20.300 --> 49:23.283
- It's in my purse, on the table!

49:25.377 --> 49:27.627
(coughing)

49:28.850 --> 49:30.600
- You want someone, take me!

49:30.600 --> 49:32.150
I'm right her, come and get me!

49:32.150 --> 49:32.983
Take me!

49:35.269 --> 49:36.885
(growling)

49:36.885 --> 49:39.302
(screeching)

49:40.958 --> 49:43.708
(fire crackling)

49:44.706 --> 49:47.373
(plants crying)

49:52.020 --> 49:54.270
(growling)

49:58.136 --> 50:00.886
(fire crackling)

50:09.115 --> 50:11.865
(birds chirping)

50:16.276 --> 50:18.859
(somber music)

50:19.917 --> 50:21.710
- Our final story

50:21.710 --> 50:24.533
brings us a series of brutal murders.

50:25.470 --> 50:28.910
A lethal hunter ravaging a small town

50:29.760 --> 50:31.430
and a group of people

50:31.430 --> 50:34.550
headed for a blood-drenched encounter,

50:34.550 --> 50:37.010
all in a strange little tale

50:37.010 --> 50:38.907
called, "The Hunt."

50:38.907 --> 50:41.490
(somber music)

50:42.725 --> 50:45.595
(suspenseful music)

50:45.595 --> 50:47.762
(gasping)

50:49.301 --> 50:51.384
(crying)

50:54.372 --> 50:55.618
- [Man] Somebody!

50:55.618 --> 50:57.151
(snarling)

50:57.151 --> 50:58.151
- Elizabeth!

50:59.240 --> 51:01.990
(birds chirping)

51:13.940 --> 51:16.940
(somber beat music)

51:47.430 --> 51:48.263
- Okay.

51:49.400 --> 51:50.650
So now, Mr. Linden,

51:50.650 --> 51:53.193
you claim not to have
seen anything at all.

51:54.110 --> 51:55.160
- That's what I said.

51:57.040 --> 52:00.820
- And you're not sure that
you heard anything either.

52:00.820 --> 52:02.373
- Nope, not sure.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.863
- Mr. Linden, can I be frank with you?

52:06.980 --> 52:08.080
Several other people,

52:08.080 --> 52:10.690
farther away from where
the murders took place,

52:10.690 --> 52:13.520
are positive they heard a
woman screaming for help

52:14.910 --> 52:16.530
and if that's the case,

52:16.530 --> 52:17.960
then it's hard to believe that a woman

52:17.960 --> 52:19.584
screaming right outside your doorstep

52:19.584 --> 52:21.493
didn't get your attention.

52:21.493 --> 52:24.317
- I told you, I ain't sure what I heard.

52:24.317 --> 52:27.595
Coulda been coyotes for all I knew.

52:27.595 --> 52:28.845
- Coyotes, huh?

52:29.730 --> 52:32.970
There have been several
very brutal murders,

52:32.970 --> 52:36.080
all in close proximity to your place.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.290
- The police already questioned me.

52:38.290 --> 52:40.789
They was here all day yesterday.

52:40.789 --> 52:42.837
- Well now I'm questioning you.

52:44.300 --> 52:46.193
- I can't tell you nothing else.

52:50.300 --> 52:51.630
- Okay.

52:51.630 --> 52:53.080
Then I guess we're done here.

53:06.590 --> 53:08.090
Something I can help you with?

53:09.196 --> 53:11.870
(ominous music)

53:11.870 --> 53:14.077
Can I help you with something?

53:31.388 --> 53:34.221
(engine rumbling)

53:43.523 --> 53:45.223
- Dang kids.

53:45.223 --> 53:47.473
Always messing up property.

53:52.300 --> 53:55.050
(siren alarming)

53:59.378 --> 54:02.568
(ominous music)

54:02.568 --> 54:05.568
(people chattering)

54:44.150 --> 54:46.817
- The unholy beast must be laid to rest!

54:46.817 --> 54:48.860
(people gasping)

54:48.860 --> 54:50.010
- Get them out of here.

54:50.870 --> 54:52.220
- Okay, folks, show's over.

54:52.220 --> 54:54.410
Let's move it back, please.

54:54.410 --> 54:57.077
(ominous music)

55:03.600 --> 55:05.350
- Jimmy Rogers, Beacon Post.

55:05.350 --> 55:07.370
Is there any hard
evidence in the case yet?

55:07.370 --> 55:09.140
- I have no statement
to make at this time.

55:09.140 --> 55:12.270
- Why has this investigation
been taken over by the FBI?

55:12.270 --> 55:14.210
And what about all the
reports about conflicts

55:14.210 --> 55:15.680
with local law enforcement?

55:15.680 --> 55:17.280
- I said I have no statement.

55:17.280 --> 55:19.580
- And what about all the
talk about a monster?

55:20.713 --> 55:22.880
About a monster roaming the town?

55:22.880 --> 55:24.360
How much longer do the people have to wait

55:24.360 --> 55:26.193
before they get some answers?!

55:27.317 --> 55:29.984
(ominous music)

55:32.486 --> 55:35.236
(pleasant music)

55:37.724 --> 55:39.974
(rattling)

55:46.661 --> 55:48.911
(rattling)

55:51.189 --> 55:53.856
(spray hissing)

56:02.195 --> 56:03.867
- [Mr. Linden] You, get out of here!

56:03.867 --> 56:05.450
- Screw you, Cyrus!

56:17.845 --> 56:20.095
(knocking)

56:40.230 --> 56:43.500
- So I take it there is
something I could help you with.

56:43.500 --> 56:44.333
- Maybe.

56:45.320 --> 56:47.670
- I must say, you got
here pretty fast on foot.

56:48.920 --> 56:50.600
- I'm familiar with the area.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.250
I grew up around here.

56:52.250 --> 56:55.640
- So what can I do for you, Mister?

56:55.640 --> 56:56.740
- Johnson.

56:56.740 --> 56:57.763
Darren Johnson.

56:58.890 --> 57:01.460
- What can I do for you, Mr. Johnson?

57:01.460 --> 57:02.600
- You're the FBI agent

57:02.600 --> 57:05.030
investigating the murders
in town, aren't you?

57:05.030 --> 57:06.203
- That's right.

57:06.203 --> 57:07.036
Leanna.

57:07.036 --> 57:07.869
Leanna Stark.

57:08.990 --> 57:10.090
What can I do for you?

57:11.007 --> 57:13.800
- Do you have any leads
to the killer's identity

57:13.800 --> 57:15.343
or where they might be?

57:16.720 --> 57:19.510
- That's confidential, Mr. Johnson.

57:19.510 --> 57:21.860
My investigation's ongoing.

57:21.860 --> 57:23.653
Do you have any information for me?

57:24.910 --> 57:25.770
- No.

57:25.770 --> 57:28.670
It's just I don't think
it's a normal killer

57:28.670 --> 57:29.870
that we're dealing with.

57:31.090 --> 57:32.623
- What exactly does that mean?

57:33.520 --> 57:36.660
- Well, it may not be something
that you're expecting.

57:38.420 --> 57:41.720
- Mr. Johnson, do you
watch the local news a lot?

57:41.720 --> 57:43.920
- Yeah, as much as the
next person, I guess.

57:45.500 --> 57:48.927
- My guess is a little
more than the next person.

57:48.927 --> 57:51.853
"It" may not be "something" I'm expecting?

57:53.010 --> 57:55.590
Your local reporters and
the townsfolk around here

57:55.590 --> 57:57.890
have some wild imagination

57:57.890 --> 58:00.870
and if you're here to feed
me more of that vampire crap,

58:00.870 --> 58:02.320
you can save it.

58:02.320 --> 58:05.320
- You might be better off keeping
an open mind about things.

58:05.320 --> 58:07.710
- I might be better off
getting a good night sleep

58:07.710 --> 58:10.900
before I file a long and
tedious report with the bureau

58:10.900 --> 58:12.320
and then I'll be better off finding out

58:12.320 --> 58:14.350
who is committing these sick murders.

58:14.350 --> 58:15.670
And then I might be better off

58:15.670 --> 58:17.713
getting out of this dead end town!

58:18.620 --> 58:20.540
Now I'm gonna ask you again,

58:20.540 --> 58:22.589
do you have anything to share?

58:22.589 --> 58:23.510
- No.

58:23.510 --> 58:24.483
Nothing to share.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.353
- Stupid hicks.

58:35.643 --> 58:38.310
(spray hissing)

58:45.284 --> 58:47.840
(ominous music)

58:47.840 --> 58:48.983
- Hey, who's there?

58:50.522 --> 58:53.272
(birds chirping)

58:55.410 --> 58:57.143
I said, who's there?

58:58.171 --> 59:00.838
(ominous music)

59:06.948 --> 59:07.781
(gasping)

59:07.781 --> 59:09.295
(growling)

59:09.295 --> 59:12.045
(girl screaming)

59:14.200 --> 59:16.430
- [Darren] Don't play games
with me, I'm warning you!

59:16.430 --> 59:17.620
You better tell me, or else!

59:17.620 --> 59:18.780
- [Cyrus] You're crazy!

59:18.780 --> 59:19.613
Get out of here!

59:19.613 --> 59:22.290
- You better start talking
or you'll be sorry!

59:22.290 --> 59:24.790
You know where she is and
you're going to tell me!

59:25.992 --> 59:28.280
- I don't know what you're talking about.

59:28.280 --> 59:29.163
- You lie!

59:30.070 --> 59:31.930
- Get out of here before
I call the police.

59:31.930 --> 59:33.440
- You're hiding that woman.

59:33.440 --> 59:34.640
That thing.

59:34.640 --> 59:35.940
- I said get out of here.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.800
- I know how to deal with it.

59:37.800 --> 59:38.650
- She'd kill you.

59:38.650 --> 59:39.603
She'd kill us both.

59:40.530 --> 59:42.840
- What's the problem here, gentlemen?

59:42.840 --> 59:44.973
Mr. Johnson, drop the piece of wood.

59:46.940 --> 59:49.120
Now I'm gonna wanna word with you.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.650
Mr. Linden, stay where you are

59:51.650 --> 59:53.950
because I'm gonna wanna
word with you as well.

59:56.900 --> 59:57.733
Have a seat.

01:00:03.826 --> 01:00:06.290
Did you knock Mr. Linden to the ground?

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.220
- I might have.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.510
We were having a discussion.

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:10.980
- A discussion?

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.030
Looked more like a heated argument to me.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.970
If I catch you assaulting Mr. Linden,

01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:19.960
or anyone else for that matter,

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.150
I will cuff you on the spot.

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:23.830
Is that clear?

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:24.663
- Yes.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.950
- Good.

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:28.337
Now what's with the wooden stake?

01:00:28.337 --> 01:00:30.920
- You must know the answer to that by now.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.140
- Oh yes, I forgot.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.880
You think the killer's a vampire

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.400
and let me guess,

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.410
you're here to kill it
with a wooden stake.

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:41.920
- I don't care if you believe me or not.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.560
I know the truth.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.010
- I seriously suggest

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:47.910
that you don't go waving
those things around at people.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.683
It might be bad for your health.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.003
Now, Mr. Linden,

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.070
have you got something to share with me?

01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:59.330
- It's Camille.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:00.293
She's the one.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.060
- Camille?

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.720
The one who's committing all these murders

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.060
is a woman named Camille?

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.523
- No, not a woman.

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:12.020
- You too?

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.770
You're gonna feed me this crap too?

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.713
- It ain't crap.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.110
- All right, Mr. Linden,

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.460
why don't you enlighten me?

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:26.240
- One morning, close to sunrise,

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.383
I heard a rapping at my back door.

01:01:29.242 --> 01:01:31.492
(knocking)

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:34.034
There she was.

01:01:34.034 --> 01:01:38.077
This woman with a blanket thrown over her.

01:01:38.077 --> 01:01:40.583
Her face just peeking out from under it.

01:01:41.655 --> 01:01:43.590
(somber music)

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.620
She looked nervous.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.910
Like someone was after her.

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:49.380
Kept looking up at the sky

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.967
as if something was
gonna fall down on her.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:56.500
She said she needed help.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.290
I asked her what's wrong

01:01:58.290 --> 01:01:59.700
but she wouldn't say.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.410
So I said, "Come in."

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:06.210
But she hesitated and asked
me if she was invited.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.076
I didn't think nothing of it.

01:02:08.076 --> 01:02:11.503
Just said, yes, she's
invited and brought her in.

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:18.390
She said she was traveling
by foot around the country

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:21.973
and needed a place to stay for a few days.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.393
Anyway,

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:29.020
nothing happened that day.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.440
She stayed in the spare room

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.803
with the shades drawn and the door locked.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.583
I thought she was just tired.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.202
The next night, I heard a scream
not too far from the house.

01:02:44.202 --> 01:02:46.891
(eerie music)

01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:48.190
And I went outside

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:50.247
and through the graveyard.

01:02:56.337 --> 01:02:58.837
(eerie music)

01:03:02.982 --> 01:03:04.987
(squelching)

01:03:04.987 --> 01:03:07.500
And that's when I saw her,

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.171
feeding on that first hiker.

01:03:10.171 --> 01:03:12.504
(crunching)

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.760
There was blood everywhere.

01:03:20.982 --> 01:03:23.149
(hissing)

01:03:27.043 --> 01:03:30.290
And that's when she saw me watching.

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:33.910
She said she'd do the same
to me if I said anything.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.270
I said nothing to nobody.

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:39.983
Since then, she's been hiding
out in my old tool shed.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.720
I guess she likes it better there.

01:03:45.085 --> 01:03:47.380
I kept hoping she'd leave,

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:48.993
go to some other town.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.840
- He should he help responsible!

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.480
- Why don't you take me out

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.421
to this shed of yours, Mr. Linden?

01:03:59.421 --> 01:04:00.650
- No.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:02.150
- I'll make him take us out there!

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:03.238
- Stay out of this!

01:04:03.238 --> 01:04:04.283
- I can't!

01:04:04.283 --> 01:04:05.525
She'll kill me!

01:04:05.525 --> 01:04:06.358
She'll kill me!

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:07.950
- Don't even think about following me!

01:04:09.258 --> 01:04:12.258
(suspenseful music)

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.670
- Get out of here!

01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:32.013
Leave it alone!

01:04:32.013 --> 01:04:34.452
- Drop the gun, Mr. Liden, now!

01:04:34.452 --> 01:04:36.445
(gunshot booming)

01:04:36.445 --> 01:04:38.612
(booming)

01:04:53.497 --> 01:04:55.740
(ominous music)

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.990
(thudding)

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:06.187
(foreboding music)

01:05:27.855 --> 01:05:30.938
(ominous beat music)

01:05:58.523 --> 01:06:01.523
(crickets chirping)

01:06:10.268 --> 01:06:12.518
(growling)

01:06:29.133 --> 01:06:32.133
(suspenseful music)

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.126
- Hello?

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:38.793
(ominous music)

01:07:01.795 --> 01:07:03.962
(hissing)

01:07:05.041 --> 01:07:07.326
(yelling)

01:07:07.326 --> 01:07:10.326
(suspenseful music)

01:07:11.659 --> 01:07:14.111
(crying)

01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:16.528
(squelching)

01:07:17.803 --> 01:07:19.970
(gasping)

01:07:29.858 --> 01:07:30.714
(hissing)

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.881
(yelling)

01:07:35.632 --> 01:07:36.632
- Elizabeth!

01:07:40.961 --> 01:07:43.711
(dramatic music)

01:07:51.141 --> 01:07:52.308
Elizabeth, no!

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:57.050
Elizabeth!

01:07:57.050 --> 01:07:58.340
Elizabeth!

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.590
Come on, come on!

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:00.643
Elizabeth, come on.

01:08:01.847 --> 01:08:03.268
Somebody.

01:08:03.268 --> 01:08:05.935
(ominous music)

01:08:24.124 --> 01:08:27.041
(foreboding music)

01:08:32.301 --> 01:08:33.848
- Drop the wood.

01:08:33.848 --> 01:08:35.715
- She killed my wife!

01:08:35.715 --> 01:08:37.220
(gunshots booming)

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.421
(menacing music)

01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:41.205
(hissing)

01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:42.375
(booming)

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:44.283
(hissing)

01:08:44.283 --> 01:08:47.283
(suspenseful music)

01:08:53.688 --> 01:08:56.202
(booming)

01:08:56.202 --> 01:08:58.368
(hissing)

01:09:06.233 --> 01:09:07.816
- Well look at you.

01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:12.069
And I thought vampires were nonsense.

01:09:12.069 --> 01:09:13.393
Just a bunch of crap.

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:15.593
Here you are.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.323
In the flesh.

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:22.229
You've certainly done a number
on these people, haven't you?

01:09:23.313 --> 01:09:25.840
And now you're gonna do something for me.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.252
You're gonna help me out.

01:09:30.216 --> 01:09:31.290
(gunshot booming)
(hissing)

01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:32.703
Wrong answer, bitch!

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:36.160
See, I've got lots of ammo

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.649
and though I may not be able to kill you,

01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:41.832
I can torture you all night long.

01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:45.542
Are you ready to listen
to what I have to say?

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.593
I'll take your silence as a yes.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:53.380
I want out of this rat race.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.733
People think my life is exciting,

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.223
like on TV.

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.163
Think again, sister.

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.163
My life is going through the motions.

01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:11.510
Long hours,

01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:13.580
no recognition,

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.710
lonely nights,

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:18.240
ex-husbands that don't
wanna pay child support

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.503
when they're supposed to.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.163
That's my life.

01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:27.480
But not anymore because here you are

01:10:28.499 --> 01:10:30.499
and you're gonna get rid of that for me.

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:33.540
You're gonna take away the pain

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.280
and I'm gonna have total freedom,

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.681
just like

01:10:37.681 --> 01:10:38.514
you!

01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:42.243
Now,

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.340
are you gonna play ball

01:10:47.238 --> 01:10:50.103
or do I have to fire off another shot?

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.163
Easy now.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.150
I hope you've got a good bedside manner

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:02.343
because if I feel more
than a few pin pricks,

01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:06.120
I'm gonna start blasting away.

01:11:14.558 --> 01:11:15.394
(squelching)

01:11:15.394 --> 01:11:17.387
(gasping)

01:11:17.387 --> 01:11:19.887
(eerie music)

01:11:21.162 --> 01:11:23.329
(gagging)

01:11:43.168 --> 01:11:46.400
(ominous music)

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.567
(gagging)

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.276
(gasping)

01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:09.528
(whimpering)

01:12:10.649 --> 01:12:13.316
(ominous music)

01:12:18.827 --> 01:12:21.577
(sinister music)

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.753
(birds chirping)

01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:37.853
- So you see,

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.243
that one was my story.

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:44.983
(pleasant music)

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.050
Like I said,

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:06.933
some strange things have
happened here over the years.

01:13:08.495 --> 01:13:11.245
(pleasant music)

01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:34.273
(ominous beat music)

01:14:28.939 --> 01:14:31.939
(upbeat jazz music)

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:08.791
(ominous beat music)

01:15:40.209 --> 01:15:43.209
(suspenseful music)

01:16:36.518 --> 01:16:39.018
(eerie music)
