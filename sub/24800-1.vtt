06:04.863 --> 06:05.864
Mommy?

06:06.783 --> 06:07.951
Jack!

06:09.619 --> 06:10.578
Jack!

06:15.333 --> 06:16.334
Jack!

06:19.211 --> 06:20.379
Where are you!

06:30.598 --> 06:32.391
Over there is fine.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.017
Ruth? It's Paulina.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.271
Patch me through to Morgan.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.733
Paulina, how was your flight?

06:41.735 --> 06:42.569
Long.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.194
Did you get the
email I sent you?

06:45.196 --> 06:47.738
Great location, lots
of red tape, though.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.490
I can get us through it.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.992
I'm sure you can.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.577
But Thomas won't go for
anything, unless he knows

06:53.579 --> 06:55.747
exactly what he's getting into.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.082
I'll get him the specs on
every inch of this place.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.043
Try to enjoy yourself,
it's a tropical island

07:00.045 --> 07:01.418
for God's sake.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.255
I'll relax when
I have your office.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.257
Slow down.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.925
I might have another
year left in me.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.385
Did you put in a
good word for me?

07:09.387 --> 07:11.596
Every chance I get.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.264
You know, take care of
yourself, and keep me posted.

07:14.266 --> 07:16.269
Okay, Morgan. See you.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.445
Welcome to Resort
Saipan, my name is Tony.

07:28.447 --> 07:31.865
And here are your Bojobo dolls,

07:31.867 --> 07:35.204
This, a gift from the
natives of Saipan.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.125
Depending how you place them.

07:42.127 --> 07:43.211
Different wish.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.963
This is for children.

07:52.262 --> 07:53.430
Gracias, that will be all.

07:54.139 --> 07:55.430
Adios.

07:55.432 --> 07:57.601
Enjoy your stay in Saipan.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.123
Coffee?

08:20.125 --> 08:21.291
Yes. Please.

08:22.377 --> 08:25.336
Coffee. Cream,
no sugar, to go.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.506
Good memory.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.966
Any sign of Dave?

08:29.968 --> 08:33.510
Yeah. He's out shooting
the cargo ships coming in.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.679
Hey, did your brother get
back to you this morning?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.390
Yeah. He did.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.642
Thanks for asking.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.684
I'm sure it's all
going to work out.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.602
Everything will be alright.

08:43.605 --> 08:46.775
We all got to grow
up sometime, right?

08:50.113 --> 08:51.281
That's Alan.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.201
Paulina.

08:57.912 --> 08:58.747
Hi.

09:00.539 --> 09:03.749
Hey, Alan, this is
my associate, Tyler.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.584
He's my architectural
consultant.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.627
Tyler!

09:06.629 --> 09:08.130
Great to meet you.

09:15.804 --> 09:19.183
Well, I'll go, find Dave.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.063
- So How are...
- You want some coffee?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.399
Sorry.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.374
No, I'm fine.

09:43.082 --> 09:43.998
Dave!

09:44.000 --> 09:44.958
Hey.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.045
Long time no see.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.963
Paulina. Great to see you.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.256
It's good to see you.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.424
How's island life
been treating you?

09:53.426 --> 09:54.927
Amazing as ever.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.012
Hey Tyler.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.513
I picked up this shirt in Tokyo.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.933
What does it say?

10:08.774 --> 10:11.983
"I am America's
number one pervert."

10:11.985 --> 10:13.986
Son of a bitch.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.280
The sales person said it
was a very funny shirt.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.739
It is.

10:17.741 --> 10:19.408
Impressive at
reading Japanese,

10:19.410 --> 10:21.368
can't be an easy
language to master.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.954
My pronunciation's for
shit but I can stumble

10:22.956 --> 10:24.664
through a conversation.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.498
Me, I prefer to
speak dollars and cents.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.126
The language the whole
world understands.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.084
You know what I mean?

10:29.086 --> 10:30.752
Shall we?

10:30.754 --> 10:32.463
Hey, what are they
protesting about?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.464
Yeah, the property we
are headed to, actually.

10:34.466 --> 10:35.800
Shouldn't worry.

10:35.802 --> 10:36.802
Natives never go
anywhere in there.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.179
Wait 'till you see this place.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.180
It's beautiful.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.350
It's 20 acre that you got.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.233
Pepe, what the hell is this?

10:53.235 --> 10:54.903
You don't like it?

10:56.405 --> 10:58.321
All good vans taken.

10:58.323 --> 11:01.785
Plus, you always say
to save money, boss.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.996
My cousin give us good deal.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.830
Just help them with their stuff.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.373
Okay, okay. Got it.

11:08.375 --> 11:09.293
Um, it's,

11:10.419 --> 11:11.837
Yeah. It's good.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.006
Thanks.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.345
Seems odd that the locals
are protesting the sale

11:21.347 --> 11:22.637
but they never go there.

11:22.639 --> 11:25.182
During World War II, some
of the natives went missing,

11:25.184 --> 11:27.685
probably worked to
death by the Japanese.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.186
My guess is that they
want to put a memorial up.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.229
So if we obtain the land,

11:31.231 --> 11:33.523
we'll just make it part
of our construction.

11:33.525 --> 11:35.901
Whoa. Somebody's been
doing their homework, huh?

11:35.903 --> 11:40.614
It was sacred burial ground,
before Japanese even come.

11:40.616 --> 11:45.453
From early Spanish colonies,
they bring disease and bad men.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.747
A lot of our people died.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.248
But the point is.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.459
It's that the Japanese is the
one who desecrated the land,

11:51.461 --> 11:54.630
but now it's just a
prime real estate.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.884
Pepe is right.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.886
There's a lot of
folklore dating back

12:01.888 --> 12:03.262
to the Spanish colonization.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.348
Nobody cares about the
Spanish or the locals,

12:05.350 --> 12:06.932
it's the World War II aspect

12:06.934 --> 12:09.893
that the history
buffs are after.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.478
There's tours given
on the island already,

12:11.480 --> 12:13.815
but you guys can run your
own from the new resort.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.985
I'm more interested
in the folklore.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.552
If it's a burial ground,

12:43.554 --> 12:45.680
shouldn't the natives be
visiting out of respect?

12:45.682 --> 12:47.098
Not normal ground.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.932
They think it is cursed place.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.102
Superstitious son of bitches.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.521
Witch doctors give
Saipan bad name.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.105
We're modern people now.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.400
Like Americans and Japanese.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.359
This place sounds wonderful.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.778
It's going to make it
difficult to hire local staff.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.198
You offer them a couple bucks

13:04.200 --> 13:06.783
and you watch superstition
fly out the window.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.618
Money trumps fear every time.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.204
Worked on me, boss.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.625
See? Nothing to worry about.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.977
Christ's sake, Pepe.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.031
I got a set of
these in my room,

13:46.033 --> 13:48.658
but they were way
nicer than this.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.994
Bojobo dolls. Local
good-luck charms.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.039
Not always.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.666
The way they're tied
signifies the wish.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.670
Hey, what do these mean?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.675
That we should keep out.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.013
Back inside.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.017
It's a little further up.

14:30.285 --> 14:31.370
Pepe!

14:53.100 --> 14:54.099
Now that's a view.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.602
Did I deliver or what?

14:56.604 --> 14:57.605
It's nice.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.189
But there's a lot of trees
that will need clearing.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.192
Are there utilities
routed out this far?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.233
Just 2 miles up the road.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.153
Really.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.905
Paulina, the beauty of this
place is how untouched it is.

15:07.907 --> 15:14.244
Which makes it an
expensive development.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.247
I see.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.792
Morgan has taught you well.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.881
There's a lovely cove down
the way with a waterfall.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.759
Hey Dave, Alan's going
to show you a waterfall.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.594
Grab whatever else you can get.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.555
Tyler and I are going
to scout the beach.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.060
Meet us down there in an hour.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.608
I'm thinking two infinity pools

15:43.610 --> 15:46.401
facing this side with
a V shaped structure

15:46.403 --> 15:49.655
in order to maximize
balconies with this view.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.114
Or you could work
with the landscape.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.910
Consider three
tiers of Bungalows.

15:53.912 --> 15:56.790
Jungle, beach, over-water.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.915
Push the romance factor.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.876
Sell it as an exclusive to
honeymooners and couples.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.460
Cuts down on clearing costs.

16:03.462 --> 16:08.299
And you can push the eco-friendly
factor to the locals.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.967
I like it.

16:09.969 --> 16:14.057
But don't give Alan an inch
if we want a good price.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.812
So how long have
you known Alan?

16:20.647 --> 16:21.605
Not long.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.824
Amazing.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.700
I haven't seen this
species before.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.494
Do either of you
know what it is?

16:37.496 --> 16:40.500
Yeah, that's
Pervertis Americans.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.426
What is that thing?

16:52.428 --> 16:54.094
Hydro-sole-atomizer.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.345
Very good for the skin.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.848
It has aromatic qualities,

16:56.850 --> 16:58.810
Yeah, forget I asked.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.193
So, you found
my favorite spot!

17:14.200 --> 17:16.450
What do you think?

17:16.452 --> 17:17.701
This place has potential.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.202
Alright.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.247
But being so remote, it
would complicate construction.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.539
A lot.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.874
What are you
guys talking about?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.709
This place is dying
to be a 5 star resort.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.755
Dave has the photographer's
eyes, he sees it.

17:28.757 --> 17:32.174
Speaking of which, Dave,
can we get some aerial?

17:32.176 --> 17:35.135
Thought you'd never ask.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.014
This here is the X8-M drone.

17:38.016 --> 17:41.642
State of the art
and ready to fly.

17:41.644 --> 17:45.815
We'll have footage of this entire
property in under an hour.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.029
Don't touch it!

18:04.084 --> 18:06.918
Wait, Dave, can you go
over the last section again?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.419
Got it.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.255
Zoom in.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.762
I thought you said
no one comes here.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.059
Well, whoever it is,
they're trespassing.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.020
No, they look like they are
headed somewhere specific.

18:27.022 --> 18:27.939
Probably to the bunker.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.776
Bunker?

18:32.444 --> 18:36.279
It's just an old machine
gun nest, it's nothing.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.242
We'll need to see it.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.561
They're Latte stones.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.519
It's thought they were
pillars that the Chamarro

19:07.521 --> 19:09.104
built their houses on.

19:09.106 --> 19:12.232
That's what white man thinks.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.403
These mark way to sulares,

19:17.781 --> 19:18.949
sacred ground.

19:19.867 --> 19:20.701
Really?

19:30.252 --> 19:34.087
Very strong spirits,
place the Latte Stones.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.132
When trespassers come
without permission,

19:36.134 --> 19:38.010
they become very angry.

19:39.471 --> 19:40.971
Best not to touch.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.853
He's screwing with you.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.978
Listen you can keep these
up for cultural value or

19:49.980 --> 19:52.105
level the whole place.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.359
I've always thought it would
make a great tennis court.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.528
Buyer's choice, of course.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.705
Hey this is private property.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.792
Come on, out!

20:09.834 --> 20:10.876
Pepe!

20:11.336 --> 20:12.295
On it, boss.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.353
Did he just say
you have a gun?

20:30.355 --> 20:32.020
He's bluffing.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.730
Ignorant bastards.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.065
I knew you spoke Spanish but...

20:35.067 --> 20:36.734
Chamorro uses
some Spanish words.

21:24.951 --> 21:25.951
Come on.

21:32.584 --> 21:33.543
What did he say?

21:34.210 --> 21:36.335
Superstitious bullshit.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.505
Like mi madre used to say.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.804
How deep do you
think it goes down?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.890
Could be 10 feet.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.226
Could be a mile.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.146
What was that?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.814
It's nothing, Dave.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.649
You know there's no real
reason to go down there, right?

21:58.651 --> 22:01.818
Your people could just wall
up that entrance and be done.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.490
What do you think?

22:05.366 --> 22:06.949
If it runs under
the property it could

22:06.951 --> 22:07.951
create a structural issue.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.540
Better take a look.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.669
Yup.

23:27.699 --> 23:28.533
One more.

23:35.498 --> 23:38.583
This will definitely
need a full survey.

23:38.585 --> 23:42.756
But we're, not really
equipped for cave exploration.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.257
Yeah, Tyler's got a
point there, you know.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.092
Look, why don't we hire
a full excavation team

23:48.094 --> 23:49.179
as soon as we're in escrow.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.554
Thomas won't sign off
for an unknown property.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.848
We need to what's down here.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.436
It's your call.

23:58.730 --> 23:59.564
Paulina.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.482
Let's do it.

24:03.484 --> 24:08.447
Dave, front and center, I
want all of this on video.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.480
I thought you just said
it was a machine gun nest.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.735
That's what I
was told, alright?

24:47.737 --> 24:50.822
Did you never bother to check?

24:50.824 --> 24:52.614
That looks solid.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.992
I sure hope so.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.135
Wow.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.775
I'm surprised the Marines

25:27.777 --> 25:29.362
didn't strip this
place for souvenirs.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.612
Who's to say
they even found it?

25:31.614 --> 25:35.701
This is nowhere near where
the Americans invaded.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.832
Somebody didn't clean
up after themselves.

25:42.834 --> 25:46.546
And looks like that
somebody was real hungry.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.138
How far does this go?

25:56.347 --> 25:58.849
Now, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

26:01.853 --> 26:02.977
Alright.

26:02.979 --> 26:05.604
Let's go for it.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.523
Come on.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.651
Paulina.

26:13.448 --> 26:14.449
Coming, boss?

26:17.618 --> 26:18.577
Uh, yeah.

26:19.746 --> 26:20.663
Yeah.

26:58.201 --> 26:59.700
That's a real dead body.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.244
We can all see that, Dave.

27:01.246 --> 27:05.291
I had no idea that there was
anything like this down here.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.792
Listen, Pepe, will get
a full team

27:07.794 --> 27:09.043
to take care of the remains.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.461
I would hope so.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.963
Paulina.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.341
Paulina, hold on.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.805
Dave, Dave.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.308
Come on, let's go.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.388
Dave, what is it?

28:02.390 --> 28:08.268
How many dead
people are down here?

28:08.270 --> 28:09.271
Paulina, I...

28:13.067 --> 28:14.068
Oh my God.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.863
What would a woman be doing
down here in war time?

28:18.865 --> 28:21.615
She could've been
a prisoner, spy.

28:21.617 --> 28:22.616
But she's wearing slacks.

28:22.618 --> 28:23.867
Women in the 40s wore skirts.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.244
Maybe her dress got ruined.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.248
Does it really matter?

28:30.042 --> 28:30.876
Pepe?

28:35.131 --> 28:36.132
Thought I hear something.

28:37.884 --> 28:38.884
A ghost?

28:39.885 --> 28:41.052
A ghost?

28:41.054 --> 28:42.053
Really?

28:42.055 --> 28:43.054
Yeah.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.096
Really.

28:44.098 --> 28:45.139
You're an idiot.

28:45.141 --> 28:47.143
And you're an asshole.

29:10.625 --> 29:11.625
What the hell?

29:15.797 --> 29:16.714
Hello?

29:32.605 --> 29:33.605
Who is that?

29:39.945 --> 29:40.904
Hey.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.412
Get, out.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.370
Out!

29:49.372 --> 29:50.206
Before!

29:50.832 --> 29:51.916
Door!

29:52.125 --> 29:54.251
Let go of me!

29:56.462 --> 29:57.338
Who the hell is that?

29:58.631 --> 30:01.798
What the hell is that!

30:01.800 --> 30:02.632
You killed him.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.552
Shut up!

30:04.679 --> 30:05.846
He's still breathing.

30:10.018 --> 30:12.644
What are you trying to tell us?

30:13.563 --> 30:14.770
Let me see your footage.

30:14.772 --> 30:15.854
Let go.

30:15.856 --> 30:16.939
- What are you doing!
- Delete the footage!

30:16.941 --> 30:17.776
Alan!

30:21.320 --> 30:22.987
You,

30:22.989 --> 30:23.823
must,

30:24.865 --> 30:25.700
die.

30:49.140 --> 30:51.309
Your fault.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.776
You all saw that, right?

31:01.778 --> 31:03.068
I mean, that was
self defense, right?

31:03.070 --> 31:04.362
You saw he ran at
me, attacked me!

31:04.364 --> 31:06.072
Hell, Jesus Christ!

31:06.074 --> 31:10.245
He's practically dead when we
got here, I mean, look at him!

31:11.162 --> 31:13.996
How did he know your name?

31:13.998 --> 31:15.248
How the hell should I know?

31:15.250 --> 31:17.290
Maybe he locked him
down here years ago.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.628
Don't be ridiculous, Dave.

31:21.006 --> 31:22.462
Who are you calling?

31:22.464 --> 31:26.883
Can you connect me to the
local police department?

31:26.885 --> 31:27.884
Let go!

31:27.886 --> 31:28.885
I need that footage,

31:28.887 --> 31:29.886
Get off him!

31:29.888 --> 31:30.889
Alan, get off!

31:40.733 --> 31:41.732
Oh my god.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.776
What the hell was that?

31:43.778 --> 31:45.361
I don't know but we've
got to get out of here.

31:45.363 --> 31:46.612
Tyler.

31:46.614 --> 31:47.449
Listen.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.624
Is everyone okay?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.293
I think so.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.880
I've been better.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.884
Who turned on the lights?

32:50.886 --> 32:53.095
What the hell was that?

32:53.097 --> 32:54.389
Who cares?

32:54.391 --> 32:56.682
Let's just get out of it
before it happens again.

32:56.684 --> 32:58.517
Broke the damn light.

32:58.519 --> 32:59.643
You're paying for this.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.480
Shut up.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.405
Old man is gone.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.288
He wasn't even dead.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.961
The others are gone, too

33:32.554 --> 33:34.014
This isn't right.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.018
What?

33:48.903 --> 33:49.820
Come on.

33:50.654 --> 33:51.571
We should get out of here.

33:51.573 --> 33:52.572
But it's not,

33:52.574 --> 33:54.032
You got to be kidding me!

33:54.034 --> 33:56.995
Now what?

34:17.556 --> 34:20.351
Son of a bitch!

34:21.268 --> 34:22.266
It's no good, it won't budge.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.893
What do you mean?

34:23.896 --> 34:26.063
I mean it won't budge!

34:26.065 --> 34:29.150
Help! Somebody
help us! Let us out!

34:31.195 --> 34:32.737
We left that open, I swear.

34:32.739 --> 34:34.655
We should never
have gotten in here.

34:34.657 --> 34:37.494
Does anybody
else have a signal?

34:39.871 --> 34:40.704
Dead.

34:43.625 --> 34:44.831
You two pissed
off those natives

34:44.833 --> 34:47.085
and they locked us in here!

34:49.588 --> 34:50.838
We didn't do it!

34:50.840 --> 34:52.757
We don't even know
these assholes!

34:52.759 --> 34:54.425
Just let us out!

34:54.427 --> 34:55.760
Dave, Dave. Calm down.

34:55.762 --> 34:57.220
Calm down.

34:57.222 --> 34:58.470
Alright?

34:58.472 --> 34:59.472
Look.

34:59.474 --> 35:00.682
It doesn't matter anymore.

35:00.684 --> 35:03.101
We just need to find
another way out.

35:03.103 --> 35:04.601
Yeah.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.978
That should be right.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.938
They wouldn't just
have one exit.

35:07.940 --> 35:12.150
If the enemy blew it up
everyone would be trapped.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.904
What is that sound?

35:15.447 --> 35:19.451
God bless, God bless
Tyler, God bless Paulina,

35:20.869 --> 35:21.704
It's me.

35:23.164 --> 35:24.165
I'm praying.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.458
I thought you said you
weren't superstitious.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.836
Praying can't hurt, yeah?

35:29.838 --> 35:31.795
Well it's annoying,
so knock it off!

35:31.797 --> 35:33.005
I'm sorry, boss.

35:33.007 --> 35:34.173
Dave's right.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.845
There has to be another way out.

35:46.938 --> 35:48.688
We should check in here again.

35:48.690 --> 35:50.858
Maybe there's a back door.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.242
This has to be
a different room.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.287
But it looks identical.

36:04.289 --> 36:05.290
Just like the...

36:07.000 --> 36:09.960
This is definitely
the same room.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.711
Same bed, same spot.

36:12.713 --> 36:13.713
It's not possible.

36:13.715 --> 36:15.173
Yes.

36:15.175 --> 36:16.301
Not possible.

36:19.512 --> 36:22.764
Maybe those native
people are messing with us.

36:22.766 --> 36:24.349
They could've cleaned it all
up while we were knocked out.

36:24.351 --> 36:25.474
That couldn't have been
more than five minutes

36:25.476 --> 36:26.851
between the quake and the
lights coming back on.

36:26.853 --> 36:27.726
There's no way.

36:27.728 --> 36:28.811
Are you sure?

36:28.813 --> 36:30.646
A clean-up like
this would take days.

36:30.648 --> 36:31.938
It just doesn't add up.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.525
Maybe we're on
a different level.

36:34.485 --> 36:35.985
What do you mean?

36:35.987 --> 36:37.487
Like, same floor
plan, different level.

36:37.489 --> 36:39.697
We might be one floor down?

36:39.699 --> 36:40.990
But why go through
all the trouble?

36:40.992 --> 36:42.492
Jesus, who cares!

36:42.494 --> 36:46.456
There's no another exit
in this room, so let's go!

36:48.583 --> 36:50.168
He's got a point.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.920
I'm going this way.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.505
No, we should stick together.

36:56.507 --> 36:58.550
Yeah, I'm done
following your lead.

36:59.052 --> 37:00.217
Pepe.

37:00.219 --> 37:01.802
Alan.

37:01.804 --> 37:04.723
We'll cover more
ground this way.

37:08.728 --> 37:09.561
Pepe!

37:13.900 --> 37:16.358
Must be a way out
here somewhere!

37:16.360 --> 37:19.196
I think there
isn't any way out.

37:20.072 --> 37:22.615
Are you quitting on me?

37:22.617 --> 37:25.617
You come here,
Taotaomo'nas are angry.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.412
Taotaomo'nas? I thought
you were modern people, Pepe?

37:27.414 --> 37:30.206
Modern people don't
know everything, yeah?

37:30.208 --> 37:32.085
You show me that, boss.

37:34.086 --> 37:35.713
What did you say?

37:40.092 --> 37:41.677
Listen to me, Pepe.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.804
If you think, I'm
going the wrong way,

37:45.806 --> 37:47.597
then you feel free to run
back off to the others

37:47.599 --> 37:49.935
and see where that gets you.

37:51.771 --> 37:52.647
No, boss.

37:57.110 --> 38:00.695
They are not going
the right way, either.

38:00.697 --> 38:01.780
I tell you.

38:06.619 --> 38:07.954
Nobody gets out.

38:11.248 --> 38:12.500
Shut up, Pepe.

39:24.322 --> 39:25.155
Jackpot.

39:31.079 --> 39:34.079
Japanese, do you speak Japanese?

39:34.081 --> 39:37.916
I can ask where toilet is.

39:37.918 --> 39:38.920
You make that work.

39:39.253 --> 39:40.422
Come on, Pepe.

39:53.393 --> 39:54.809
Sorry, boss.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.980
Nothing about toilet here.

40:01.067 --> 40:01.900
Tyler.

40:19.835 --> 40:23.211
I think this was lying there.

40:50.617 --> 40:51.701
It's a diary.

40:54.788 --> 40:55.621
See.

40:57.039 --> 40:59.666
He says, my sins are too many.

40:59.668 --> 41:01.419
They haunt my dreams.

41:02.378 --> 41:05.128
I will make amends with my life.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.299
Then the dreams will stop.

41:10.094 --> 41:13.012
I guess he made them stop.

41:13.014 --> 41:13.847
Guys?

41:16.141 --> 41:16.975
Hey! Hey!

42:58.411 --> 42:59.911
Who the hell is that?

42:59.913 --> 43:02.412
This guy just came in and
started waiving his gun around,

43:04.166 --> 43:05.168
Shut. Up.

43:10.340 --> 43:11.341
He could've shown us a way out.

43:11.675 --> 43:13.093
He found a way.

43:15.094 --> 43:16.011
Bullshit.

43:17.347 --> 43:19.304
We found a radio but everything
is labeled in Japanese.

43:19.306 --> 43:21.307
Take me there.

43:21.309 --> 43:22.143
Come on.

43:36.657 --> 43:37.574
No, boss.

43:39.952 --> 43:41.286
Nobody gets out.

43:47.335 --> 43:48.168
Here.

43:49.963 --> 43:50.964
Okay.

43:54.300 --> 43:55.301
Okay.

44:01.557 --> 44:02.391
Damn it!

44:07.271 --> 44:08.605
I got something.

44:10.065 --> 44:11.441
It's Japanese.

44:11.443 --> 44:13.653
Great. Just talk to them.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.171
It's a recorded message.

44:34.173 --> 44:35.630
Just keeps repeating.

44:35.632 --> 44:37.176
What does it say?

44:38.302 --> 44:40.346
It's an imperial order.

44:46.353 --> 44:51.358
David... David.

44:57.864 --> 45:02.532
Civilians who commit suicide
get equal spiritual status

45:02.534 --> 45:04.744
to soldiers who die in battle.

45:04.746 --> 45:07.374
Maybe, try another frequency.

45:13.797 --> 45:15.965
Kill her, Tyler.

45:22.097 --> 45:23.682
Wait, what is it?

45:25.891 --> 45:27.559
It's, just static.

45:29.019 --> 45:29.853
Great.

45:30.896 --> 45:32.063
Isn't it, Paulina?

45:32.065 --> 45:32.981
Just great!

45:39.239 --> 45:41.074
Dave.. Dave,

45:45.327 --> 45:49.079
I gave you first crack at
this property, as a favor!

45:49.081 --> 45:50.664
I had 3 other buyers out there!

45:50.666 --> 45:51.999
All ready to sign,
ready to bring in

45:52.001 --> 45:53.166
their own the professional team!

45:53.168 --> 45:54.418
Just like you should've done!

45:54.420 --> 45:55.628
If they'd even
found out about it

45:55.630 --> 45:56.795
before they started
the construction.

45:56.797 --> 45:58.255
Maybe if you hadn't
lied about it.

45:58.257 --> 45:59.298
Listen!

45:59.300 --> 46:00.590
Listen.

46:00.592 --> 46:02.135
All these arguing isn't
doing anybody any good.

46:02.137 --> 46:05.890
We still need to find
another way out, right?

46:10.144 --> 46:12.271
Hey, Dave. Are you okay?

46:14.983 --> 46:15.942
I'm fine.

46:17.235 --> 46:18.945
Did we reach someone?

46:19.945 --> 46:20.779
No.

48:12.224 --> 48:13.641
Which way do we go?

48:13.643 --> 48:15.894
Well, I'm going this way.

48:37.041 --> 48:38.418
It's your lead.

48:44.923 --> 48:46.509
I'll take it.

48:50.096 --> 48:52.512
Hey guys, what about Pepe?

48:52.514 --> 48:56.685
He's probably hiding in
some corner, so screw him.

49:07.197 --> 49:09.615
Japanese didn't carve this.

49:10.617 --> 49:11.576
Here.

49:22.961 --> 49:24.255
Definitely not.

49:30.969 --> 49:32.096
Smells awful.

49:47.987 --> 49:49.655
More Latte stones?

49:54.869 --> 49:55.870
I know what this place is.

49:59.331 --> 50:03.668
I've read about it in a
book on Chamorro folklore.

50:03.670 --> 50:05.920
This was a burial site
for ancient chiefs.

50:05.922 --> 50:08.338
These were the
first Bojobo dolls.

50:08.340 --> 50:12.175
And, they help the spirits of
ancient chief and his bride,

50:12.177 --> 50:14.345
whose bond was eternal.

50:14.347 --> 50:17.934
That's why all the
dolls come in pairs now.

50:19.101 --> 50:22.854
By separating the two
a curse was formed.

50:22.856 --> 50:24.313
His bride was kept above ground,

50:24.315 --> 50:26.441
but the chief was
buried down here

50:26.443 --> 50:28.358
with a Spanish commander
who did terrible things

50:28.360 --> 50:32.030
to the Chamorro people during
the first colonization.

50:32.032 --> 50:33.905
The Chief's suffering
for his lost love

50:33.907 --> 50:36.117
would be equally eternal
and that torment,

50:36.119 --> 50:38.702
would be felt by the commander,

50:38.704 --> 50:42.914
who's supposed to be still
down here, and still alive.

50:42.916 --> 50:44.458
Oh my god, that's
the biggest crock

50:44.460 --> 50:46.376
of shit I've ever heard.

50:46.378 --> 50:49.130
These people believed it
enough to paint it on the wall.

50:49.132 --> 50:50.757
To ward off the foreigners.

50:50.759 --> 50:52.215
There's probably treasure
buried down there

50:52.217 --> 50:53.717
with ancient chief.

50:53.719 --> 50:55.927
What about that crazy looking
old man that attacked you?

50:55.929 --> 50:58.432
Oh, he looks Spanish to you?

51:02.728 --> 51:04.271
Well did he?

51:04.563 --> 51:07.356
What does that say?

51:07.358 --> 51:09.943
It's asking for, forgiveness.

51:17.284 --> 51:18.118
Release.

51:20.789 --> 51:21.623
Escape.

51:23.750 --> 51:25.085
David.

51:34.094 --> 51:35.260
Claire?

51:37.347 --> 51:39.599
And then it says kill me.

51:53.487 --> 51:54.989
Oh my god, Dave!

51:57.449 --> 51:58.784
Alan, take it.

51:59.702 --> 52:01.284
I saw, I saw.

52:01.286 --> 52:02.286
It's okay.

52:02.288 --> 52:03.373
Relax, relax.

52:06.458 --> 52:09.293
Dave, I think it's
dislocated. Alright?

52:09.295 --> 52:10.795
It's alright, my brother
did the same thing

52:10.797 --> 52:12.257
when we were kids.

52:14.050 --> 52:15.800
Sorry, pal.

52:15.802 --> 52:17.637
This is going to hurt.

52:22.599 --> 52:24.307
We should get him
back to the barracks.

52:24.309 --> 52:25.892
Yeah.

52:25.894 --> 52:28.813
Dude we don't
have time for this.

52:28.815 --> 52:31.735
We need to keep
searching for an exit.

52:33.945 --> 52:36.070
Oh, come on, Paulina.

52:36.072 --> 52:37.822
No one is stopping you, Alan.

52:37.824 --> 52:39.322
Just uhh, don't
forget to come find us

52:39.324 --> 52:41.160
if you find a way out.

52:42.161 --> 52:44.580
Fine. We'll stick together.

52:49.878 --> 52:50.711
Easy.

52:59.304 --> 53:00.805
Watch your head.

53:15.987 --> 53:18.865
I'll stay with him.
You guys go on.

53:23.702 --> 53:25.038
Alan is wrong.

53:26.246 --> 53:27.248
The curse is real.

53:33.963 --> 53:35.465
You should rest.

53:41.929 --> 53:43.347
Somebody there?

53:48.478 --> 53:50.230
What is this place?

54:09.248 --> 54:12.251
We're not one
floor down, are we?

54:13.628 --> 54:15.547
I saw these exact same
pictures in the room before.

54:16.255 --> 54:18.255
It's the natives.

54:18.257 --> 54:19.757
Okay? It must be.

54:19.759 --> 54:20.925
Tyler, the natives are
just screwing with us.

54:24.139 --> 54:24.972
Pepe?

54:28.393 --> 54:29.641
Mother of God.

54:29.643 --> 54:31.936
What have you done to yourself?

54:31.938 --> 54:34.938
I am witness now.

54:34.940 --> 54:38.108
There must always be a witness.

54:38.110 --> 54:39.526
She told me.

54:39.528 --> 54:40.612
Who told you?

54:43.992 --> 54:44.826
Mi madre.

54:46.327 --> 54:49.037
Someone must carry their pain.

54:49.039 --> 54:51.621
You listen to me, Pepe.
Your mother is dead.

54:51.623 --> 54:52.625
Only one, forever.

54:54.835 --> 54:55.834
I've had enough of this shit.

54:55.836 --> 54:57.463
No, no, no, Alan!

54:59.007 --> 55:01.340
Taotaomo'nas protect me.

55:01.342 --> 55:02.844
Screw you, Pepe.

55:05.679 --> 55:06.681
It's okay.

55:09.141 --> 55:10.099
Easy, Pepe.

55:10.101 --> 55:13.728
Take it easy.

55:13.730 --> 55:17.900
It's best you heed to
warnings, of your ancestors.

56:13.706 --> 56:15.375
Claire.

56:33.351 --> 56:34.394
I'm so sorry.

56:35.436 --> 56:37.063
It was an accident.

57:04.757 --> 57:06.759
You, murdered me!

57:15.601 --> 57:16.809
Dave.

57:16.811 --> 57:17.687
Dave.

57:18.771 --> 57:19.898
Stop it.

57:29.949 --> 57:32.075
She was choking me.

57:32.077 --> 57:34.954
Who?

57:42.295 --> 57:43.797
My sister.

57:45.172 --> 57:47.007
There was an accident.

57:52.137 --> 57:54.473
You don't have to tell me.

57:55.307 --> 57:57.476
You don't have to tell me.

58:06.277 --> 58:10.447
In the end, do you think
we'll have to pay for our sins?

58:13.952 --> 58:15.704
I hope not.

58:32.637 --> 58:36.557
The old native dropped
this outside the cave.

58:37.516 --> 58:39.059
This is the female.

58:40.769 --> 58:43.440
The male is down here somewhere.

58:44.190 --> 58:47.150
Maybe we can put the
two back together.

58:47.152 --> 58:50.739
Then maybe we can get
the hell out of here.

58:54.409 --> 58:57.077
It's more than just a folk tale.

59:04.376 --> 59:07.128
Because it is not
possible. That's why.

59:07.130 --> 59:09.171
That order was
given in 1944 when

59:09.173 --> 59:11.548
the US Marines were
overtaking the island.

59:11.550 --> 59:13.008
It's a tourist
gimmick by history nuts.

59:13.010 --> 59:14.385
And I suppose that guy
that just blew his brains out

59:14.387 --> 59:17.974
was a suicidal World
War 2 re-enactor, huh?

59:29.402 --> 59:32.820
You're saying we are
not on a different floor.

59:32.822 --> 59:34.990
We're in a different time.

59:36.576 --> 59:39.242
Yeah, that's the only
thing that makes any sense.

59:39.244 --> 59:42.204
That's the only
thing that makes sense?

59:42.206 --> 59:43.331
Do you hear yourself?

59:43.333 --> 59:44.414
Are you buying this?

59:44.416 --> 59:46.583
No! This is not an option!

59:46.585 --> 59:48.168
Okay, listen to yourself!

59:48.170 --> 59:49.170
This is insane!

59:49.172 --> 59:50.757
None of it is real!

01:00:09.483 --> 01:00:10.317
Paulina?

01:00:13.112 --> 01:00:14.778
Tyler?

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.532
Stop messing around!

01:00:23.581 --> 01:00:24.871
You,

01:00:24.873 --> 01:00:26.164
must,

01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:27.543
die.

01:00:36.635 --> 01:00:37.677
Don't you forget
you're the one

01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:39.972
who made us come down here.

01:00:47.688 --> 01:00:49.604
We are the only
sane ones left.

01:00:49.606 --> 01:00:51.733
No, he's right.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:54.943
Whatever is happening
to us is my fault.

01:00:54.945 --> 01:00:56.195
Paulina.

01:00:56.197 --> 01:00:57.032
Come on.

01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:59.990
You couldn't have known...

01:00:59.992 --> 01:01:01.492
If it wasn't for me,
we'd be back at the hotel

01:01:01.494 --> 01:01:04.662
having drinks talking about
what an asshole Alan is,

01:01:04.664 --> 01:01:08.209
I'm the one who insisted
we come down here.

01:01:10.503 --> 01:01:11.671
You're right.

01:01:14.465 --> 01:01:16.342
Alan is a huge asshole.

01:01:17.927 --> 01:01:20.010
You are completely
wrong about the rest,

01:01:20.012 --> 01:01:22.848
but Alan is
definitely an asshole.

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:34.483
Dave gave me this.

01:01:34.485 --> 01:01:37.362
He said that the old
native dropped it outside.

01:01:37.364 --> 01:01:38.862
It's the matching
female to the male doll

01:01:38.864 --> 01:01:41.157
that's supposed to be down here.

01:01:41.159 --> 01:01:44.452
Huh. Sure looks like
the one in the painting.

01:01:44.454 --> 01:01:46.996
He said if we re-unite
them then we may be able

01:01:46.998 --> 01:01:48.541
to get out of here.

01:01:49.918 --> 01:01:53.168
Look, I just told everybody
that I think we traveled

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:58.173
back in time, so I'm willing
to try anything right now.

01:01:58.175 --> 01:01:59.009
Come on.

01:02:00.887 --> 01:02:03.845
Maybe this will
give us some clues.

01:02:03.847 --> 01:02:04.807
It's bullshit.

01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:07.102
It's bullshit. Just the
natives are screwing with us.

01:02:08.853 --> 01:02:11.231
It's the natives screwing,

01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:13.900
That son of a bitch.

01:02:19.905 --> 01:02:23.574
Enough of this
voodoo crap, Pepe.

01:02:23.576 --> 01:02:26.411
You come and face me like a man.

01:02:26.413 --> 01:02:27.787
Hey, I'm talking to you!

01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:28.623
Hey!

01:02:35.295 --> 01:02:36.295
Pepe!

01:02:36.297 --> 01:02:37.295
Pepe!

01:02:37.297 --> 01:02:38.632
Pepe, come back!

01:02:39.592 --> 01:02:41.927
Listen, I just want to talk!

01:02:50.103 --> 01:02:51.146
Pepe, listen.

01:02:52.105 --> 01:02:53.104
This is okay.

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:54.354
I get it, okay.

01:02:54.356 --> 01:02:57.025
You're one of the
protesters, right?

01:02:57.027 --> 01:02:59.526
That's it. You've been working
with them from the start.

01:02:59.528 --> 01:03:01.237
You want to scare
all the white devils

01:03:01.239 --> 01:03:02.530
away from your sacred ground.

01:03:02.532 --> 01:03:04.659
It's genius.

01:03:07.954 --> 01:03:09.122
Come on, Pepe!

01:03:18.172 --> 01:03:19.963
Show us our way out of here.

01:03:19.965 --> 01:03:21.840
Tell the police
whatever you want.

01:03:21.842 --> 01:03:23.217
You hear me, Pepe?

01:03:23.219 --> 01:03:26.472
Get us out of here
and all is forgiven!

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:32.644
You want money?

01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:39.150
Just get me out of here, Pepe.

01:03:39.152 --> 01:03:40.901
I'm going to pay
whatever you want.

01:03:40.903 --> 01:03:42.153
You hear me?

01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:43.490
Name your price!

01:03:44.949 --> 01:03:45.784
Pepe!

01:03:58.838 --> 01:03:59.839
Her fault.

01:04:21.027 --> 01:04:23.697
I'm going to go check on Dave.

01:05:24.173 --> 01:05:25.592
Who's down there?

01:05:27.844 --> 01:05:28.677
Mommy?

01:05:34.976 --> 01:05:36.978
Yes, sweetie, it's me.

01:05:38.188 --> 01:05:39.105
I'm cold.

01:05:44.443 --> 01:05:46.526
I'm so sorry, Jack.

01:05:46.528 --> 01:05:48.737
I should've been watching you.

01:05:48.739 --> 01:05:50.115
Where were you?

01:05:51.576 --> 01:05:52.575
I'm right here now.

01:05:52.577 --> 01:05:54.162
Mommy's right here.

01:06:13.264 --> 01:06:14.307
I missed you.

01:06:18.811 --> 01:06:20.980
Did you forget about me?

01:06:21.981 --> 01:06:23.316
Of course not.

01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:26.568
I love you.

01:06:35.411 --> 01:06:37.496
Why did you let me die?

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.084
Paulina!

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.512
What's the matter?

01:06:59.018 --> 01:07:01.101
My son, I saw my son.

01:07:01.103 --> 01:07:02.021
Hey. Hey.

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.111
Whatever you saw.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.530
Whatever you saw,
it wasn't real.

01:07:12.532 --> 01:07:13.408
Okay?

01:07:18.496 --> 01:07:19.497
I didn't know you had a son.

01:07:22.916 --> 01:07:25.045
I lost him 6 years ago.

01:07:29.757 --> 01:07:31.507
I'm so sorry.

01:07:31.509 --> 01:07:32.427
He was 6.

01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:36.804
And we were at the pier.

01:07:36.806 --> 01:07:38.389
I was with this
guy I was dating,

01:07:38.391 --> 01:07:41.186
and I got distracted.

01:07:43.563 --> 01:07:47.648
I took my eyes off him
for just one minute,

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:49.402
and then he was gone.

01:07:52.989 --> 01:07:55.907
The next morning his
body washed up on shore.

01:07:55.909 --> 01:07:57.827
He must have fallen in.

01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:06.166
That's why I can't
be with anyone.

01:08:06.168 --> 01:08:08.170
Can you understand that?

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.264
Well, well, well.

01:08:20.307 --> 01:08:22.060
What do we have here?

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:26.564
Little inner-tunnel
romance, huh?

01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:34.029
That's why you've been
so standoffish, Paulina.

01:08:35.113 --> 01:08:37.698
You should've just told me.

01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:39.202
It doesn't matter.

01:08:41.953 --> 01:08:45.125
I know he's going
to be one lucky guy.

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:48.334
What did you just say?

01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:50.337
She moaned like a
whore when I railed her.

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:57.178
Don't you ever talk
about her like that again.

01:08:57.804 --> 01:08:59.845
What's going on, Tyler?

01:08:59.846 --> 01:09:02.682
I will rip your God Damned
throat out for saying that.

01:09:02.684 --> 01:09:03.683
Tyler!

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:04.808
I didn't say anything.

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:07.185
He didn't say anything.

01:09:07.188 --> 01:09:09.524
He said that you, and him.

01:09:17.238 --> 01:09:18.157
Easy.

01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:29.502
I'm, I'm sorry.

01:09:30.502 --> 01:09:32.671
You were hearing things.

01:09:38.094 --> 01:09:39.345
The same thing happened
to the soldiers here.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.182
It's in the diary.

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:47.854
Sure.

01:09:57.238 --> 01:09:59.112
The officer and his
men were stationed here

01:09:59.114 --> 01:10:00.783
during World War II.

01:10:04.537 --> 01:10:08.708
The soldier named Kato
started behaving irrationally.

01:11:38.547 --> 01:11:40.050
The male Bojobo.

01:11:40.966 --> 01:11:43.800
Enough with the stupid dolls.

01:11:43.802 --> 01:11:45.385
Doesn't this look just
like the female doll

01:11:45.387 --> 01:11:46.803
from the painting?

01:11:46.805 --> 01:11:50.976
The old native dropped it
outside and Dave brought it in.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.608
Kato continues to
be insubordinate.

01:12:20.422 --> 01:12:23.259
They found a
passage to Gehenna.

01:12:25.011 --> 01:12:28.014
The room where the
curse originated.

01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:30.907
The battle of
Saipan had begun.

01:13:30.909 --> 01:13:32.951
What did the creature say?

01:13:32.953 --> 01:13:36.123
He just wrote it
down phonetically.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.677
That's Spanish.

01:13:49.636 --> 01:13:51.221
Only one can live.

01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:59.687
The Japanese were
ordered to hold the island

01:13:59.689 --> 01:14:01.274
until the very end.

01:14:02.567 --> 01:14:03.941
So they did.

01:14:03.943 --> 01:14:04.778
Ah, but...

01:15:11.552 --> 01:15:14.387
I am the only sane one left.

01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:16.224
I know what I must do.

01:15:35.326 --> 01:15:36.243
What?

01:15:37.203 --> 01:15:38.163
It is done.

01:15:41.957 --> 01:15:46.126
Well, that was a lot
of help, wasn't it?

01:15:46.128 --> 01:15:47.461
Listen to me.

01:15:47.463 --> 01:15:49.339
Pepe's gone off the deep end.

01:15:49.341 --> 01:15:52.215
He destroyed the radio,
and he's cut himself.

01:15:52.217 --> 01:15:54.220
Which one of us is next?

01:15:59.141 --> 01:16:01.392
Well, you two can sit
here and think about it.

01:16:01.394 --> 01:16:03.268
And I'm going to go do
what has to be done.

01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:04.438
I'll find him.

01:16:08.609 --> 01:16:11.777
You don't think
Pepe would murder us?

01:16:11.779 --> 01:16:13.030
I don't know.

01:16:14.365 --> 01:16:16.491
But the last thing soldier said

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:19.494
was that he would make
amends with his life.

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:21.331
So, he killed himself.

01:16:32.966 --> 01:16:34.094
Look at this.

01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:41.057
Seems my life is
not amends enough.

01:16:41.059 --> 01:16:44.436
How long must I live
in this hell, alone?

01:16:53.738 --> 01:16:56.074
We need to find that room.

01:17:02.788 --> 01:17:04.123
David.

01:17:14.884 --> 01:17:15.801
No.

01:17:16.176 --> 01:17:17.094
No.

01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:26.813
Oh my God, Dave.

01:17:34.487 --> 01:17:36.823
Oh, this can't be happening.

01:17:39.492 --> 01:17:41.077
It was recording.

01:17:48.917 --> 01:17:50.125
Claire!

01:17:50.127 --> 01:17:51.126
Please!

01:17:51.128 --> 01:17:52.336
No!

01:17:52.338 --> 01:17:53.547
Who's Claire?

01:17:54.798 --> 01:17:56.301
His dead sister.

01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:10.148
Wait, Pepe.

01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:14.194
Pepe had a knife.

01:18:22.034 --> 01:18:23.787
And Alan was right.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.875
The generator must be dying.

01:18:30.877 --> 01:18:31.711
Come on.

01:18:34.213 --> 01:18:36.382
Come on, we have to hurry.

01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:45.141
Stay behind me.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.882
Let me see the camera.

01:20:08.807 --> 01:20:09.809
It's alright.

01:20:22.654 --> 01:20:23.696
I think someone is there.

01:20:23.698 --> 01:20:24.574
Where?

01:20:26.784 --> 01:20:27.659
Where?

01:20:28.661 --> 01:20:30.413
I can't see anything.

01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:33.083
It's a woman.

01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:36.168
Where?

01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:39.172
I don't know, Turn
that off, I can't see.

01:20:42.841 --> 01:20:44.342
She, she's coming at us!

01:20:44.344 --> 01:20:45.884
I can't see anything!

01:20:45.886 --> 01:20:46.845
Turn off!

01:20:51.685 --> 01:20:52.519
No.

01:20:53.478 --> 01:20:55.480
No. No!

01:20:58.608 --> 01:21:00.107
Hey! Hey! Look at me!

01:21:00.109 --> 01:21:01.108
Look at me.

01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:02.317
It's not real.

01:21:02.319 --> 01:21:03.945
It's not real.

01:21:03.947 --> 01:21:05.278
It's not real.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.488
There's nothing here.

01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:07.324
See?

01:21:09.703 --> 01:21:10.867
Alright?

01:21:10.869 --> 01:21:11.829
I saw her.

01:21:19.212 --> 01:21:20.213
It's okay.

01:21:22.381 --> 01:21:23.880
Okay.

01:21:23.882 --> 01:21:26.885
We're getting out
of here, together.

01:22:30.283 --> 01:22:31.117
Oh god.

01:22:34.537 --> 01:22:35.538
That's it.

01:22:56.184 --> 01:22:57.018
Great.

01:23:05.318 --> 01:23:06.401
Mommy!

01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:07.404
It's okay.

01:23:08.863 --> 01:23:09.698
It's okay.

01:23:10.739 --> 01:23:11.657
It's okay.

01:23:18.497 --> 01:23:20.332
Did you see him again?

01:23:23.502 --> 01:23:24.336
Hey. Hey.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.964
Like you said, none
of this is real.

01:23:28.966 --> 01:23:29.800
Okay?

01:23:38.309 --> 01:23:39.144
Let me.

01:24:10.884 --> 01:24:13.345
Smells even worse down here.

01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:17.472
Oh, thank god, I found you.

01:24:17.474 --> 01:24:18.930
Alan.

01:24:18.932 --> 01:24:20.100
Dave's dead.

01:24:21.269 --> 01:24:23.021
We think it was Pepe.

01:24:27.359 --> 01:24:28.816
No.

01:24:28.818 --> 01:24:30.235
That would be me.

01:24:34.908 --> 01:24:36.491
Tyler!

01:24:36.493 --> 01:24:38.742
Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, Wake up.

01:24:38.744 --> 01:24:41.163
Come on. Talk to me. Wake up!

01:24:43.082 --> 01:24:44.581
Why?

01:24:44.583 --> 01:24:46.166
Why?

01:24:46.168 --> 01:24:47.543
You think I'm going to
wait 'til this place

01:24:47.545 --> 01:24:51.589
makes you all crazy
and you chop me up?

01:24:51.591 --> 01:24:53.259
No, no, no, Paulina.

01:24:55.261 --> 01:24:57.678
I'm going to strike first.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.013
Come here!

01:24:59.015 --> 01:24:59.849
Come back!

01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:04.727
Paulina! Where are you going!

01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:06.564
You can't run from me!

01:25:11.694 --> 01:25:12.695
You're dead!

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.905
You' hear me? dead!

01:26:05.164 --> 01:26:06.166
The curse.

01:26:17.092 --> 01:26:18.677
Only one, can live?

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:26.311
Torment to all.

01:26:31.733 --> 01:26:33.485
Witness for eternity.

01:26:37.572 --> 01:26:39.365
Torment for eternity.

01:26:39.783 --> 01:26:41.785
Now you understand.

01:26:43.453 --> 01:26:47.207
Spanish men come here,
to enslave our people.

01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:50.335
So, shaman enslave him.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.340
He kept him here.

01:26:56.216 --> 01:26:57.714
Alone.

01:26:57.716 --> 01:26:59.259
For over 300 years.

01:27:19.613 --> 01:27:21.321
Where did you find her?

01:27:21.323 --> 01:27:24.909
The old native dropped it
outside, and Dave picked it up.

01:27:24.911 --> 01:27:27.202
He should not have done that!

01:27:27.204 --> 01:27:28.370
This can all end now.

01:27:28.372 --> 01:27:31.499
We can end the
curse, and be free.

01:27:31.501 --> 01:27:33.459
That is not what
my ancestors want!

01:27:33.461 --> 01:27:35.085
But it's got
nothing to do with us.

01:27:35.087 --> 01:27:36.420
We weren't even born yet.

01:27:36.422 --> 01:27:37.588
You aren't born yet, even now.

01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:40.176
Time matters not in this place.

01:27:41.802 --> 01:27:45.222
We slide back, so
Bojobo can be together.

01:27:46.099 --> 01:27:48.726
Yes, so they can be together.

01:27:51.104 --> 01:27:53.189
They want to be together.

01:28:28.224 --> 01:28:29.641
All can be freed.

01:28:33.938 --> 01:28:35.562
Don't you worry, sweetheart.

01:28:35.564 --> 01:28:36.982
You'll get yours.

01:28:44.032 --> 01:28:46.201
- No forgiveness!
- Don't!

01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:55.835
We had a chance!

01:28:57.295 --> 01:28:58.503
Just me.

01:28:58.505 --> 01:28:59.838
Stay down, Pepe!

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:09.932
I am Gai Taotao!

01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:13.435
The spirits protect me!

01:30:25.216 --> 01:30:29.137
Only one, only one,

01:30:41.190 --> 01:30:42.358
You win, boss.

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:48.448
But you not understand.

01:30:49.114 --> 01:30:53.619
One witness forever.

01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:14.640
Chosen one, my ass.

01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:19.771
Just you and me, Paulina.

01:31:35.453 --> 01:31:38.331
Give it up, Paulina!

01:32:14.367 --> 01:32:16.453
I'm the one who survives.

01:32:55.449 --> 01:32:57.743
Paulina!

01:33:00.579 --> 01:33:01.872
Paulina!

01:33:04.708 --> 01:33:07.585
Come out come out
wherever you are, Paulina.

01:33:07.587 --> 01:33:09.255
I got you.

01:33:15.595 --> 01:33:17.180
Take it easy, okay?

01:33:20.557 --> 01:33:22.724
I should shoot
you down right now.

01:33:22.726 --> 01:33:23.560
Paulina!

01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:30.192
Don't.

01:33:34.113 --> 01:33:35.114
Don't do it.

01:33:36.282 --> 01:33:38.534
You should listen to him.

01:33:39.953 --> 01:33:41.035
Listen to him.

01:33:41.037 --> 01:33:43.161
We had a chance.

01:33:43.163 --> 01:33:44.498
We had a chance.

01:33:56.761 --> 01:33:57.971
You, bitch!

01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:00.764
Wait!

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.403
Only one can live.

01:35:10.210 --> 01:35:11.377
I'm so sorry.

01:35:45.744 --> 01:35:48.161
I love you.

01:35:48.163 --> 01:35:49.666
I love you, too.

01:35:53.712 --> 01:35:54.710
What are you waiting for?

01:35:54.712 --> 01:35:56.130
Get on with that!

01:36:28.621 --> 01:36:31.496
Just me and you, Tyler.

01:36:31.498 --> 01:36:33.499
How did I get in here?

01:36:33.501 --> 01:36:34.836
Tyler, I didn't.

01:36:43.636 --> 01:36:45.680
Bravo.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.475
You win.

01:36:50.393 --> 01:36:54.646
You, you still
don't get it, do you?

01:37:00.862 --> 01:37:03.114
You, selfish piece of shit.

01:37:07.577 --> 01:37:14.125
If you live, you lose.

01:37:19.713 --> 01:37:21.757
You lose worst of all.

01:37:31.266 --> 01:37:36.563
After all, doesn't
this all look familiar?

01:37:43.654 --> 01:37:46.907
Us here in the dark,
in about 70 years?

01:38:43.965 --> 01:38:44.798
What?

01:38:45.925 --> 01:38:46.760
I'm alive.

01:38:54.225 --> 01:38:55.060
I'm alive.

01:38:57.854 --> 01:38:58.688
We win!

01:39:39.479 --> 01:39:42.606
How many dead
people are down here?

01:39:42.815 --> 01:39:45.191
What would a woman
be doing in war time?

01:39:45.193 --> 01:39:48.113
She could be a
prisoner, spy, or,

01:39:50.989 --> 01:39:52.615
We had a chance!

01:39:52.617 --> 01:39:55.660
You win, boss. But
you not understand.

01:39:55.662 --> 01:39:58.832
Here in the dark,
in about 70 years.

01:40:01.167 --> 01:40:05.755
Only one, forever.

01:40:06.797 --> 01:40:09.425
You must die.

01:40:22.646 --> 01:40:23.564
Can't be.

01:40:26.693 --> 01:40:27.527
No!

01:41:51.903 --> 01:41:52.779
What are you!

01:41:56.032 --> 01:41:56.949
Get off me!

01:42:05.332 --> 01:42:07.125
Still breathing.

01:42:07.127 --> 01:42:09.501
Only one.

01:42:09.503 --> 01:42:16.219
- What are you trying to tell us?
- You. Must. Die.

01:46:28.512 --> 01:46:31.555
Paulina? I'm coming for you!

01:46:31.557 --> 01:46:32.391
Taxi!
