WEBVTT

00:00.572 --> 00:01.572
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.253 --> 00:04.153
Off you go.

00:04.157 --> 00:05.290
The final five were challenged

00:05.358 --> 00:07.225
to make a profitable
fine dining dish

00:07.293 --> 00:09.561
with only $10 worth
of ingredients.

00:09.629 --> 00:11.196
This is like the epitome
of what I do.

00:11.264 --> 00:13.565
And the Chefs who excelled
were Jay...

00:13.633 --> 00:15.000
I'd be happy to pay $30.

00:15.068 --> 00:16.001
Well done,
well done, well done.

00:16.068 --> 00:17.102
And Holli.

00:17.170 --> 00:19.071
I would pay $30 too,
for this.

00:19.138 --> 00:20.505
Holli was victorious.

00:20.573 --> 00:22.174
Well done, Holli.
Thank you very much.

00:22.241 --> 00:24.009
Everybody around me
is realizing

00:24.077 --> 00:25.444
I'm a contender
in this competition.

00:25.511 --> 00:27.312
Here they are.
Hello.

00:27.380 --> 00:29.815
And chose to bring Jay
with her on the reward.

00:29.882 --> 00:32.851
I was pretty psyched to spend
quality time with Holli.

00:32.919 --> 00:34.586
Which turned out
to be more like a date

00:34.654 --> 00:35.921
chaperoned by Jean-Philippe.

00:35.988 --> 00:37.289
I went to culinary school.

00:37.356 --> 00:39.024
I took a year off
because I had a son.

00:39.092 --> 00:40.859
The couple had such a good time

00:40.927 --> 00:43.962
that the date...

00:44.030 --> 00:45.197
I do.

00:45.264 --> 00:46.998
And the romance continued

00:47.066 --> 00:47.966
back in the dorms

00:48.034 --> 00:48.967
assume the position.

00:49.035 --> 00:50.569
Holli and Jay, I mean,

00:50.636 --> 00:52.304
<i>i think there's a little</i>
<i>something going on.</i>

00:52.371 --> 00:53.171
At dinner service...

00:53.239 --> 00:55.107
Come on, guys!

00:55.174 --> 00:56.308
Chef Ramsay found a way
to force the Chefs

00:56.375 --> 00:57.442
to communicate.

00:57.510 --> 00:58.977
Switch stations, guys,
yeah?

00:59.045 --> 01:00.779
Jason struggled
on the meat section.

01:00.847 --> 01:03.248
Talk to me then.
We just stopped the table.

01:03.316 --> 01:04.916
You can't just walk off
in a huff.

01:04.983 --> 01:06.918
Jay had his problems
on the fish station.

01:06.986 --> 01:09.054
Just--it's burning in the pan
before it's cooking.

01:09.122 --> 01:11.623
Don't get pissy with me.
Cook your ass off!

01:11.691 --> 01:12.524
And Ben...

01:12.592 --> 01:13.525
Are you okay?

01:13.593 --> 01:15.060
Come on, Benjamin.

01:15.128 --> 01:16.728
...Still had issues
communicating.

01:16.796 --> 01:18.997
I'm talking in his ear and he's
not even answering me.

01:19.065 --> 01:20.065
But Holli...

01:20.133 --> 01:21.199
What's wrong,
what's wrong?

01:21.267 --> 01:22.467
...Was on a hot streak.

01:22.535 --> 01:23.201
They're nicely roasted,
those scallops, yes?

01:23.269 --> 01:24.870
Thank you, Chef.

01:24.937 --> 01:27.572
And Autumn had her best
dinner service yet.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.774
<i>That wellington</i>
<i>is cooked beautifully.</i>

01:28.841 --> 01:30.542
Thank you.
And it's a wrap.

01:30.610 --> 01:32.210
The final five had
a difficult time nominating.

01:32.278 --> 01:33.745
It's nothing personal.

01:33.813 --> 01:35.947
I think both of y'all was
the quiet ones in the kitchen.

01:36.015 --> 01:37.682
But the two that were
put forward were...

01:37.750 --> 01:38.750
Ben.

01:38.818 --> 01:39.651
And...

01:39.719 --> 01:40.986
Jason.

01:41.053 --> 01:43.021
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

01:43.089 --> 01:44.656
Jason.

01:44.724 --> 01:46.725
And it was Jason
who had to say good-bye

01:46.793 --> 01:48.226
to his dream of becoming
head Chef

01:48.294 --> 01:49.728
at Gordon Ramsay's
new restaurant

01:49.796 --> 01:54.166
at London's Savoy hotel.

02:51.891 --> 02:53.925
And now, the continuation

02:53.993 --> 02:55.460
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:55.528 --> 02:57.963
You've got
a one in four chance.

02:58.030 --> 03:00.131
Sleep on that.
Good night.

03:00.199 --> 03:02.901
Good night, Chef.
Good night, Chef.

03:02.969 --> 03:04.002
Glad you're still here, Ben.

03:04.070 --> 03:07.172
I'm glad I'm still here.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.807
We're all glad
you're still here.

03:14.013 --> 03:15.847
I really do
genuinely like Jason,

03:15.915 --> 03:17.782
<i>but, like, I'd have been</i>
<i>so bummed out</i>

03:17.850 --> 03:19.184
if you left over him.

03:19.252 --> 03:20.652
He's not more passionate
about cooking than I am.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.820
That.

03:21.888 --> 03:22.687
There's no doubt
I can come through

03:22.755 --> 03:23.922
and win this competition.

03:23.990 --> 03:25.257
I feel like I got
my second wind tonight.

03:25.324 --> 03:28.026
I am gonna
Bury those girls.

03:28.094 --> 03:30.395
I feel the same way.
I have every intention

03:30.463 --> 03:32.297
of making them
look silly, period.

03:32.365 --> 03:33.331
<i>We really have to</i>
<i>just take over.</i>

03:33.399 --> 03:35.400
We have to have them
on their toes.

03:35.468 --> 03:38.103
I know I can do it. I'm a better
cook than Holli and Autumn.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.471
I know I am.

03:39.538 --> 03:41.907
And I'm the only person
who can compete with Jay.

03:41.974 --> 03:43.375
And I can beat Jay,
no doubt in my Mind.

03:43.442 --> 03:44.576
It's time.

03:44.644 --> 03:45.877
Now it's time.
Now it's, like, push it.

03:49.015 --> 03:51.182
It's a new day
in Hell's Kitchen.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.717
Good morning.
<i>Morning.</i>

03:52.785 --> 03:55.253
And Chef Ramsay
has a special treat

03:55.321 --> 03:56.554
for the final four.

03:56.622 --> 03:57.856
I'm gonna flip it around.

03:57.924 --> 03:59.891
Now I'm gonna cook
for you this morning.

03:59.959 --> 04:01.426
Awesome.

04:01.494 --> 04:03.328
Roasted monkfish
with a little potatoes.

04:03.396 --> 04:04.696
Having Chef Ramsay
make a dish,

04:04.764 --> 04:05.797
it was exciting.

04:05.865 --> 04:06.765
Watch carefully.

04:06.832 --> 04:08.233
The first thing

04:08.301 --> 04:10.435
is to get rid
of this skin here.

04:10.503 --> 04:12.804
But there's still always,
you know,

04:12.872 --> 04:14.706
the nerves
in the center of your stomach

04:14.774 --> 04:16.841
because we have no idea
what's gonna happen next.

04:16.909 --> 04:20.278
Filleting knife underneath.

04:20.346 --> 04:22.113
The monkfish
is a expensive fish.

04:22.181 --> 04:24.115
<i>Be very, very careful.</i>

04:24.183 --> 04:26.818
I think monkfish is one of
the toughest fishes to cook.

04:26.886 --> 04:29.154
More often than not, it's not
even butchered properly,

04:29.221 --> 04:31.957
never mind cooked right, so it's
definitely not for beginners.

04:32.024 --> 04:34.626
I'm gonna start off
with a nice, hot pan.

04:34.694 --> 04:36.394
Give that
a really good sear.

04:36.462 --> 04:38.029
Yeah.
It looks beautiful.

04:38.097 --> 04:39.731
As he's demonstrating,
I am, like,

04:39.799 --> 04:40.899
just like
full attention mode,

04:40.967 --> 04:42.367
like, trying to pick up
on something

04:42.435 --> 04:44.803
that'll help me make this dish
if I have to.

04:44.870 --> 04:46.738
Just take off the ends
very, very carefully.

04:46.806 --> 04:49.541
Hold it together.
Let the knife do the work, okay?

04:49.608 --> 04:50.942
Be very careful that you
don't buckle it up.

04:51.010 --> 04:53.912
Let it rest on top
of the potatoes.

04:53.980 --> 04:55.313
Okay,
have a little taste.

04:55.381 --> 04:58.516
We've taken a very difficult
fish to make right

04:58.584 --> 05:00.652
and transformed it into
something phenomenal.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.556
It's just so bright with
the capers and the peppers.

05:04.623 --> 05:06.358
Now, big question:
Do you all think

05:06.425 --> 05:07.392
you can recreate that dish
for me?

05:07.460 --> 05:08.893
Yes, Chef.
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

05:08.961 --> 05:11.963
Excellent, because today,
I'm gonna test your ability

05:12.031 --> 05:15.633
<i>to teach.</i>

05:15.701 --> 05:16.968
I thought, Holy .

05:17.036 --> 05:18.370
Ben in an instructor.

05:18.437 --> 05:19.404
This is what he does
for a living.

05:19.472 --> 05:20.939
I am screwed 100%.

05:21.007 --> 05:23.008
But to make it fair,
you're all getting students

05:23.075 --> 05:25.110
<i>with the same amount</i>
<i>of experience.</i>

05:25.177 --> 05:27.779
Zero.

05:27.847 --> 05:28.980
Guys, come on in, please.

05:29.048 --> 05:32.117
<i>Good morning.</i>

05:32.184 --> 05:34.586
Dude.

05:34.653 --> 05:35.587
I was hoping
for beauty Queens

05:35.654 --> 05:36.888
or some strippers

05:36.956 --> 05:38.123
or something along
my lines,

05:38.190 --> 05:39.491
and then out came
four guys.

05:39.558 --> 05:42.594
Good-looking guys,
but not my type.

05:42.661 --> 05:45.096
These four young,
cool dude bachelors,

05:45.164 --> 05:47.665
<i>they know</i>
<i>absolutely nothing.</i>

05:47.733 --> 05:49.768
And each one of you is gonna
teach him

05:49.835 --> 05:52.103
how to roast a monkfish.

05:52.171 --> 05:53.738
Uh, when was the last time
you were in a kitchen?

05:53.806 --> 05:55.373
To actually do something?

05:55.441 --> 05:56.374
<i>Yes.</i>

05:56.442 --> 05:58.276
They're pretty.

05:58.344 --> 05:59.544
They can't cook.

05:59.612 --> 06:03.982
Now you're all standing
opposite your bachelor.

06:04.050 --> 06:07.052
It's verbal instructions
only.

06:07.119 --> 06:08.520
Is that clear?
Yes, Chef.

06:08.587 --> 06:11.589
Half an hour,
starting from now.

06:11.657 --> 06:13.391
All right,
come over here.

06:13.459 --> 06:15.226
Grab two aprons
and some side towels,

06:15.294 --> 06:16.761
<i>and we're gonna set up</i>
<i>right over here.</i>

06:16.829 --> 06:18.396
Bring these over
to our station, please.

06:18.464 --> 06:19.364
I'm gonna grab all the food.

06:19.432 --> 06:20.665
First thing I would do,

06:20.733 --> 06:22.200
get the peppers
on the grill.

06:22.268 --> 06:24.869
And our station is...?

06:24.937 --> 06:26.171
Where are you going?

06:26.238 --> 06:27.672
I'm not sure.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.040
He said take this
to my station.

06:29.108 --> 06:29.941
He didn't tell me
where it was.

06:30.009 --> 06:30.909
Right here.

06:30.976 --> 06:32.343
Oh, .

06:32.411 --> 06:34.412
Throw these all
in this bowl.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.847
Watch your hands.
Are you okay?
Uh-huh.

06:35.915 --> 06:37.615
Peppers on the grill.
Great.

06:37.683 --> 06:39.284
Uh, Holli.
Yes.

06:39.351 --> 06:40.885
<i>He's put peppers on the grill,</i>
<i>but the grill's not on.</i>

06:40.953 --> 06:43.321
The grill's not on.

06:43.389 --> 06:45.790
Chef Ramsay believes
that to be a great Chef,

06:45.858 --> 06:48.793
it is essential
to be a great teacher.

06:48.861 --> 06:49.894
Now that only four Chefs
remain,

06:49.962 --> 06:51.162
he has designed
this challenge

06:51.230 --> 06:53.465
to determine
their teaching abilities.

06:53.532 --> 06:56.201
What is he doing,
Holli?

06:56.268 --> 06:57.569
The Chef who helps
his student

06:57.636 --> 07:00.238
most closely recreate
Chef Ramsay's dish,

07:00.306 --> 07:01.506
will win the challenge.

07:01.574 --> 07:03.575
Open the knife Kit
and grab some knives.

07:03.642 --> 07:05.043
Open the knife Kit.

07:05.111 --> 07:08.046
Oh, my God, like, this guy
has a diamond in his ear.

07:08.114 --> 07:10.248
He's probably never touched
a knife before.

07:10.316 --> 07:12.817
He spent more time putting on
his apron than he did cooking.

07:12.885 --> 07:14.986
He tied a nice,
little homemaker bow.

07:15.054 --> 07:16.488
I thought, when I saw that,
I was done.

07:16.555 --> 07:18.089
Hang up my apron.
Time to go home.

07:18.157 --> 07:21.626
Five minutes gone, guys.

07:21.694 --> 07:22.861
<i>So go ahead</i>
<i>and lift your monkfish</i>

07:22.928 --> 07:24.696
<i>up on this platter here.</i>

07:24.763 --> 07:26.731
<i>Oh, come on,</i>
<i>you're a man.</i>

07:26.799 --> 07:28.299
Lift up the skin,
and you're gonna, like,

07:28.367 --> 07:29.467
<i>kind of peel it off.</i>
Like that?

07:29.535 --> 07:30.502
<i>Like--yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

07:30.569 --> 07:31.803
<i>I think you're a natural.</i>

07:31.871 --> 07:33.972
You're gonna be, like,
super Chef after this.

07:34.039 --> 07:35.073
Cool.

07:35.141 --> 07:37.242
And you'll be married
within two days.

07:37.309 --> 07:38.776
He's like a lost puppy,

07:38.844 --> 07:41.045
so the first thing
I started working on

07:41.113 --> 07:41.913
is being a little
flirtatious.

07:45.518 --> 07:47.485
Your pepper
is very beautiful.

07:47.553 --> 07:48.686
So I've been told.

07:48.754 --> 07:50.155
I wasn't worried about Holli.

07:50.222 --> 07:53.324
The gentleman she was with was
a little on the feminine side.

07:53.392 --> 07:55.460
Hot fish coming through.

07:55.528 --> 07:56.561
Just watching them
get it together

07:56.629 --> 07:58.396
was definitely
monkfish the hard way.

07:58.464 --> 07:59.998
I just pick it up
with my hands?
Yes, yes.

08:00.065 --> 08:01.799
Cool.
You can touch
everything with your hands.

08:01.867 --> 08:03.001
All right.
Okay.

08:03.068 --> 08:05.036
Not quite.

08:05.104 --> 08:06.604
Ooh, that's hot. No wonder
they call it Hell's Kitchen.

08:06.672 --> 08:08.072
Whoo!

08:08.140 --> 08:10.074
Do you want me to do something
while you're setting up?

08:10.142 --> 08:12.610
Take the stickers
off of those peppers.

08:12.678 --> 08:14.312
I'm a teacher by nature.

08:14.380 --> 08:16.281
I'm very verbal
and I communicate well.

08:16.348 --> 08:18.483
I'm just happy I can
do something actually.

08:18.551 --> 08:21.519
I'm able to relate things
in a way that people understand,

08:21.587 --> 08:23.188
you know,
what I'm teaching.

08:23.255 --> 08:24.889
Watch that fish.
I'll be right back.

08:24.957 --> 08:28.760
I don't know what I'm watching
for, but I'll watch it.

08:30.930 --> 08:33.264
You look good, fish.

08:33.332 --> 08:34.532
What are we making?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.467
We are making
a pan-roasted monkfish.

08:36.534 --> 08:39.136
Isn't that like
a saltwater fish,

08:39.205 --> 08:41.573
or is it a--
it's a seawater fish.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.640
With a pepperaude.
What's pepperaude?

08:43.708 --> 08:44.842
<i>Potatoes.</i>

08:44.910 --> 08:45.743
What kind of bacon
was this again?

08:45.811 --> 08:47.178
It's actually pancetta.

08:47.246 --> 08:48.213
I do like teaching. I do like
teaching new people.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.714
What is the extra virgin?

08:49.782 --> 08:50.915
<i>It's from the first press.</i>

08:50.983 --> 08:52.116
What's in the five Spice?

08:52.184 --> 08:53.651
<i>Ground ginger, coriander.</i>

08:53.719 --> 08:55.620
But I could have killed him
with the questions he asked.

08:55.688 --> 08:57.288
Was I supposed to
wash my hands?

08:57.356 --> 08:58.323
Did you not wash
your hands?
No.

08:58.390 --> 08:59.123
You should always
wash your hands.

08:59.191 --> 09:01.659
Oh, Me.

09:01.727 --> 09:02.694
Last two minutes, guys.

09:02.761 --> 09:04.963
Fih-uh.

09:05.030 --> 09:06.331
Ah!
Careful.

09:06.398 --> 09:07.398
Here are your
nicoise olives.

09:07.466 --> 09:08.866
How are these different
than normal?

09:08.934 --> 09:10.134
Uh, they're
a little fancier.

09:10.202 --> 09:11.703
Even if it takes you
five minutes to do a slice,

09:11.770 --> 09:12.937
cut a perfect piece.

09:13.005 --> 09:14.205
If it falls apart,
we're screwed.

09:14.273 --> 09:16.107
Down in a long stroke.

09:16.175 --> 09:18.209
Okay, that's all right.

09:18.277 --> 09:19.611
We'll just use that
whole piece the way it is.

09:19.678 --> 09:22.513
<i>3, 2, 1...</i>

09:22.581 --> 09:23.982
<i>And serve!</i>

09:26.218 --> 09:28.686
All right, how did
your students do?

09:28.754 --> 09:29.821
Very good.
<i>Excellent, Chef.</i>

09:29.888 --> 09:31.089
You're happy
with their performance?

09:31.156 --> 09:32.423
Yes, Chef.
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

09:32.491 --> 09:33.491
<i>Good, well, let's taste it.</i>

09:33.559 --> 09:36.160
Autumn and Neil,
let's go, guys.

09:36.228 --> 09:37.795
The Chef whose student
comes the closest

09:37.863 --> 09:41.099
to recreating Chef Ramsay's
roasted monkfish entree

09:41.166 --> 09:42.367
will win the challenge.

09:42.434 --> 09:43.534
All right, Neil,
what is that?

09:43.602 --> 09:48.606
Uh, the monkfish
and a little bit of salad.

09:48.674 --> 09:50.275
What's in the potatoes?

09:50.342 --> 09:53.311
Uh, there's salt.

09:53.379 --> 09:58.182
The small,
pea-looking things.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.917
Small, pea-looking things.

09:59.985 --> 10:01.286
Capers.

10:01.353 --> 10:02.787
<i>Autumn, this is serious.</i>

10:02.855 --> 10:04.589
I'm asking Neil exactly
what you told him.

10:04.657 --> 10:06.691
He's nervous.
He's nervous?

10:06.759 --> 10:08.026
Yes.

10:08.093 --> 10:10.561
That's it?
Where has the monkfish gone?

10:10.629 --> 10:12.664
We had a hard time
cutting the monkfish.

10:12.731 --> 10:13.831
Gone--that's not
what I'm asking about,

10:13.899 --> 10:17.702
how hard a time.
Where is the monkfish?

10:17.770 --> 10:19.337
The knife
got out of control.

10:19.405 --> 10:22.740
That's all right. We'll just use
that whole piece the way it is.

10:22.808 --> 10:24.475
It's--it's--it's shredded.

10:24.543 --> 10:25.943
It wasn't good
for presentation.

10:26.011 --> 10:27.512
I'm sorry.
<i>What a shame.</i>

10:27.579 --> 10:29.113
The taste is nice.
Slightly salty.

10:29.181 --> 10:31.716
However, it's missing
90% of the monkfish.

10:31.784 --> 10:33.484
Right.

10:33.552 --> 10:35.086
You know, it sucks.
I should have at least

10:35.154 --> 10:37.288
put the shredded portions
on the plate.

10:37.356 --> 10:38.923
I definitely regret that.

10:38.991 --> 10:39.891
What a shame.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.092
You live and you learn.

10:43.529 --> 10:44.829
All right.
Jay and Rick, let's go.

10:44.897 --> 10:46.664
Put it on the table
and take the dome off.

10:46.732 --> 10:48.866
Thank you, Rick.
You're very welcome, Chef.

10:48.934 --> 10:50.768
<i>Excellent.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

10:50.836 --> 10:52.303
The presentation,
superb.

10:52.371 --> 10:53.371
You ever sliced
monkfish before?

10:53.439 --> 10:55.173
Never.
Not even fish sticks.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.908
I honestly thought Jay
had sliced that.

10:56.975 --> 10:58.109
What is it?

10:58.177 --> 11:00.411
It's a pan-seared monkfish.
Mm-hmm.

11:00.479 --> 11:02.080
<i>With pancetta,</i>
<i>capers, olives,</i>

11:02.147 --> 11:03.548
roasted red peppers.

11:03.615 --> 11:05.950
<i>Delicious.</i>

11:06.018 --> 11:07.118
The monkfish
is cooked perfectly.

11:07.186 --> 11:08.219
He did great, Chef.

11:08.287 --> 11:09.754
Rick is a prime example

11:09.822 --> 11:10.955
of don't
judge a book by his cover.

11:11.023 --> 11:11.989
<i>What would I change?</i>

11:12.057 --> 11:13.391
Less vinegar
in the salad.

11:13.459 --> 11:14.792
Nitpicking.
Well done.

11:14.860 --> 11:16.194
Thank you, Chef.
<i>Very well done.</i>

11:16.261 --> 11:17.729
I thought I was really in
for a rough day,

11:17.796 --> 11:19.831
and I'm actually
very pleasantly surprised.

11:19.898 --> 11:21.499
Good. Benjamin and Steve,
let's go.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.868
I'm very confident.
Everything was there.

11:23.936 --> 11:25.036
The seasoning was there,
the flavors were there.

11:25.104 --> 11:26.871
The monkfish
was cooked perfectly.

11:26.939 --> 11:28.072
I could win this competition
easily.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.540
What is the dish?

11:29.608 --> 11:33.144
It's, uh, monkfish
with, uh, olives in it,

11:33.212 --> 11:36.781
and there's, like,
a micro basil salad.

11:36.849 --> 11:37.982
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

11:38.050 --> 11:39.183
Have you ever cooked
monkfish before?

11:39.251 --> 11:40.318
Uh, no, I'd barely
ever heard of it.

11:40.386 --> 11:41.753
<i>All right.</i>

11:41.820 --> 11:45.757
Unfortunately, the peppers
are almost raw.

11:45.824 --> 11:48.359
And the pancetta
is burnt.

11:48.427 --> 11:49.761
<i>What a shame.</i>

11:49.828 --> 11:51.195
<i>Just out of interest,</i>

11:51.263 --> 11:52.997
um, Benjamin, you're
a culinary teacher, right?

11:53.065 --> 11:54.098
Yes, Chef.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.666
Steve, how did he
come across?

11:55.734 --> 11:57.935
I was just kind of following
him and waiting for him

11:58.003 --> 12:00.071
to give me direction.

12:00.139 --> 12:01.105
You know, I don't know
what Steve's grading on.

12:01.173 --> 12:02.340
He threw me under the bus.

12:02.408 --> 12:05.176
I didn't Him.
He Ed me.

12:05.244 --> 12:08.112
Chris and Holli,
let's go.

12:08.180 --> 12:10.381
All right,
what is that, Chris?

12:10.449 --> 12:12.950
Uh, this is monkfish.
Mm-hmm.

12:13.018 --> 12:14.285
It's made with love.

12:16.755 --> 12:18.122
Made with love.

12:18.190 --> 12:20.625
Yes.

12:20.692 --> 12:21.959
What's in the potatoes?

12:22.027 --> 12:25.730
Potatoes.

12:25.798 --> 12:26.898
Take your time.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.769
Oh, God, you don't tell Chef
how to eat.

12:31.837 --> 12:34.472
If you were actually
in Hell's Kitchen,

12:34.540 --> 12:38.042
Chef Ramsay would have
thrown the plate at you.

12:38.110 --> 12:39.477
It tastes delicious.

12:39.545 --> 12:40.945
Really? I mean, yes.

12:41.013 --> 12:43.481
That's the first
perfect potato I've had.

12:43.549 --> 12:46.083
That monkfish slightly hashed
as opposed to being carved.

12:46.151 --> 12:47.752
<i>However, at least we have got</i>
<i>all the monkfish on there.</i>

12:47.820 --> 12:48.986
<i>Good job.</i>

12:49.054 --> 12:50.121
Right on.
Thank you very much.

12:50.189 --> 12:51.022
Well done.

12:53.592 --> 12:55.126
Considering
none of these guys

12:55.194 --> 12:56.828
<i>had ever cooked</i>
<i>properly before,</i>

12:56.895 --> 12:58.696
<i>each and every one of you</i>
<i>have done a very good job.</i>

12:58.764 --> 13:00.765
Thank you, Chef.
Thank you.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.500
<i>It's a difficult one.</i>

13:02.568 --> 13:03.935
Congratulations

13:04.002 --> 13:07.238
goes to...

13:12.305 --> 13:14.573
Chef Ramsay has
challenged the Chefs

13:14.640 --> 13:16.441
to teach bachelors
with no cooking experience

13:16.509 --> 13:19.077
how to recreate
a monkfish entree,

13:19.145 --> 13:22.214
and he must now decide
who was the best teacher.

13:22.281 --> 13:24.816
Congratulations
goes to...

13:28.654 --> 13:30.355
Jay and Rick.
Well done.

13:30.423 --> 13:31.323
<i>Really well done.</i>

13:32.892 --> 13:34.559
I'm happy.
I'm psyched that I won.

13:34.627 --> 13:36.328
It's just one more step
up the ladder.

13:36.395 --> 13:38.330
So it's one more thing
I can show Chef Ramsay

13:38.397 --> 13:39.431
that I did positively.

13:39.498 --> 13:42.167
That dish was, um,
almost perfect.

13:42.235 --> 13:44.402
Carved beautifully,
seasoned perfectly,

13:44.470 --> 13:45.704
<i>cooked to perfection.</i>

13:45.771 --> 13:48.039
The dish looked like
you had done it.

13:48.107 --> 13:49.574
Thank you.

13:49.642 --> 13:51.543
Bachelors, I've got a little
present for you all.

13:51.611 --> 13:53.778
<i>Scott, please.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:53.846 --> 13:55.881
<i>This is a copy</i>
<i>of my latest book.</i>

13:55.948 --> 13:58.750
<i>Bedtime reading, yes?</i>
<i>Enjoy.</i>

13:58.818 --> 14:00.185
Now do me a favor.
Off.

14:00.253 --> 14:02.120
<i>Let's go.</i>

14:02.188 --> 14:04.222
<i>Excellent.</i>

14:04.290 --> 14:06.157
Well done.

14:06.225 --> 14:08.426
<i>Losers, today's gonna be</i>
<i>a tough one.</i>

14:08.494 --> 14:09.861
Today in Hell's Kitchen,
it's maintenance day.

14:09.929 --> 14:13.198
We've got wobbly tables,
we've got screws missing,

14:13.266 --> 14:15.533
we've got light bulbs
that need replacing.

14:15.601 --> 14:16.868
We need to spruce
this place up a bit.

14:16.936 --> 14:19.804
Secondly, the car parking lot
needs cleaning,

14:19.872 --> 14:21.940
sweeping, brushing,
and tidying up.

14:22.008 --> 14:24.910
It sucks but, you know,
I am a handy woman.

14:24.977 --> 14:25.911
I fix everything
around my house.

14:25.978 --> 14:27.279
No big deal.

14:27.346 --> 14:28.780
And once you finish that,
get back in the kitchen

14:28.848 --> 14:32.550
and get prepped because tonight,
I'm gonna open Hell's Kitchen.

14:32.618 --> 14:35.320
Like, Dinner service.
Dinner service.

14:35.388 --> 14:38.990
<i>Jay, you're gonna do something</i>
<i>very exclusive.</i>

14:39.058 --> 14:40.926
It's a
once-in-a-lifetime thrill.

14:40.993 --> 14:42.193
Would you like to know
what it is?

14:42.261 --> 14:43.895
Yes, Chef.
Good, I'm not gonna tell you.

14:43.963 --> 14:45.563
<i>You're gonna have to wait</i>
<i>and see.</i>

14:45.631 --> 14:46.798
You've got 30 seconds
to choose a partner

14:46.866 --> 14:50.735
<i>to take with you.</i>

14:50.803 --> 14:53.038
I'm gonna choose Holli.

14:53.105 --> 14:54.673
Yay!

14:54.740 --> 14:56.574
I knew right
from the beginning,

14:56.642 --> 14:58.310
if I didn't win,
I wasn't gonna be picked,

14:58.377 --> 15:00.412
because I don't have
any friends here.

15:00.479 --> 15:01.813
And of course it sucks.

15:01.881 --> 15:03.882
All right, Holli and Jay,
upstairs to the dorm.

15:03.950 --> 15:05.850
<i>I'll call you back</i>
<i>in five minutes, yes?</i>

15:05.918 --> 15:07.552
Benjamin and Autumn,
a lot of work to do.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.154
Yes, Chef.

15:09.221 --> 15:10.989
In order to make sure that we
don't get our whites dirty,

15:11.057 --> 15:13.358
<i>andi, handyman overalls.</i>

15:13.426 --> 15:16.194
Jean-Philippe will call you
in a couple minutes. Off you go.

15:17.463 --> 15:21.032
I feel bad for Ben.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.267
You can go back in there
and change it.

15:22.335 --> 15:23.601
No, I mean, I just
don't think it'd be as fun.

15:23.669 --> 15:25.637
I love him,
but he's not--

15:25.705 --> 15:27.739
I'm pretty exciting.

15:29.275 --> 15:30.775
Dude, I'm sorry.

15:30.843 --> 15:34.145
I feel really bad for Ben
because we're good friends here,

15:34.213 --> 15:36.014
and I personally wouldn't
want to be left with Autumn.

15:36.082 --> 15:37.749
But Holli's pretty--
pretty good looking.

15:37.817 --> 15:40.251
I really wanted to pick you,
but I-I had--I owed her.

15:40.319 --> 15:42.053
<i>I feel bad.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:42.121 --> 15:45.090
I feel like you hate me.
Don't hate me.

15:45.157 --> 15:46.224
I'm totally bummed.

15:46.292 --> 15:47.392
I would have liked
to have gone,

15:47.460 --> 15:48.660
but I'm not gonna
sleep with Jay,

15:48.728 --> 15:49.894
so...

15:52.231 --> 15:55.066
I think Ben's furious.

15:58.504 --> 16:00.071
I'm so glad
you picked me, Jay.

16:00.139 --> 16:01.673
I'm really excited
about the reward.

16:01.741 --> 16:03.141
I don't know
what the hell it is.

16:03.209 --> 16:05.343
Jumping off a bridge?
Bungee jumping?

16:05.411 --> 16:07.045
Parasailing?

16:07.113 --> 16:08.580
So I don't know.
It could be anything.

16:08.647 --> 16:10.949
Oh, my God.

16:12.084 --> 16:13.852
<i>It's the goodyear blimp!</i>

16:13.919 --> 16:14.953
Hello.
<i>Hi!</i>

16:15.021 --> 16:16.488
That's amazing.

16:16.555 --> 16:18.056
Really, I've always wondered,
like, who the hell

16:18.124 --> 16:20.892
ever gets to go
up in a blimp?

16:20.960 --> 16:23.495
I guess we're the lucky ones
today.

16:23.562 --> 16:25.530
<i>It's pretty awesome.</i>

16:25.598 --> 16:27.799
<i>It doesn't say why we're</i>
<i>being congratulated.</i>

16:27.867 --> 16:29.701
It seemed like, you know,
a marriage proposal.

16:29.769 --> 16:32.337
That's awesome.

16:32.405 --> 16:33.671
Hi, guys.

16:33.739 --> 16:35.540
Okay, all the way
to the back.

16:37.877 --> 16:40.045
<i>Do you get blimp sick?</i>

16:40.112 --> 16:41.813
<i>I-I don't know yet.</i>

16:41.881 --> 16:43.515
If I do, I'll aim
right for you.

16:43.582 --> 16:44.883
Thank you.
No problem.

16:44.950 --> 16:47.252
<i>Here we go.</i>

16:49.555 --> 16:50.522
Yeah, the takeoff's
kind of steep.

16:50.589 --> 16:52.824
Kind of?

16:52.892 --> 16:54.092
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

16:54.160 --> 16:58.163
Look, there's two
dead bodies floating.

16:58.230 --> 16:59.297
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

16:59.365 --> 17:00.432
It's my pleasure, j.P.

17:00.499 --> 17:01.499
Yeah? I bet.

17:01.567 --> 17:04.803
So let's go.
Let's crack it.

17:04.869 --> 17:07.472
It was a double punishment
today.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.973
Being alone with Autumn,
that was the biggest punishment.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.776
I think I'm
too skinny for mine.

17:11.844 --> 17:13.877
She just wants to be here
so she can look pretty.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.579
She's not passionate.

17:15.647 --> 17:16.681
She probably doesn't
even give a

17:16.749 --> 17:17.781
About the
Hotel Savoy.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.349
Did you give me the one
that's broken?

17:19.417 --> 17:21.586
Uh-uh.
Try this one here.

17:21.654 --> 17:23.922
I think the pressure definitely
might be getting to Ben.

17:23.989 --> 17:25.890
He's starting to crack up
a little,

17:25.958 --> 17:27.692
and when you're on
a downward decline,

17:27.760 --> 17:29.861
it is hard to recover
quickly.

17:29.929 --> 17:31.563
You're professionals,
eh?

17:31.630 --> 17:32.464
I try to be at everything.

17:37.336 --> 17:40.205
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>it's so amazing.</i>

17:40.272 --> 17:42.740
This is the most
amazing thing ever.

17:44.076 --> 17:45.877
Oh, yeah.
Ocean!

17:45.945 --> 17:47.078
I'm--I'm loving it.

17:48.981 --> 17:50.248
I'm from the area,

17:50.316 --> 17:51.749
so I'm familiar
with all the streets,

17:51.817 --> 17:54.252
but, you know, seeing it
from this point of view,

17:54.320 --> 17:55.954
it gives you a totally
different feeling.

17:56.021 --> 17:59.958
We are definitely
not disappointed.

18:00.025 --> 18:02.660
I think it would be awesome
if we flew over Hell's Kitchen.

18:02.728 --> 18:03.728
<i>That'd be so awesome.</i>

18:03.796 --> 18:05.063
<i>They would hate us.</i>

18:07.600 --> 18:08.700
Okay, guys.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.835
We need to speed up.
Let's go, let's go.

18:10.903 --> 18:12.337
And scrub it.

18:18.344 --> 18:22.647
Hey, look-it!
There they are!

18:22.715 --> 18:25.917
They're on a blimp?
Yeah.

18:25.985 --> 18:27.819
I see 'em!
There, right there.

18:27.887 --> 18:29.087
Where, where, where?
There, see?

18:29.155 --> 18:31.322
<i>They're gonna be</i>
<i>so pissed off.</i>

18:31.390 --> 18:37.495
"Losers, hope you're enjoying
your punishment."

18:38.564 --> 18:40.598
I'm definitely jealous.

18:40.666 --> 18:42.467
<i>They must be laughing</i>
<i>themselves to death now.</i>

18:42.535 --> 18:45.170
It's so awesome.

18:45.237 --> 18:46.437
<i>Poor, poor bitches.</i>

18:46.505 --> 18:48.706
<i>I love it.</i>

18:48.774 --> 18:51.309
It sucks to be you.

18:51.377 --> 18:52.644
That's for sure.

18:52.711 --> 18:55.213
They're having the time
of their life.

18:55.281 --> 18:56.781
So are they part of the
mile-high club now, you think?

18:56.849 --> 18:58.583
I don't think it's a mile high.

18:58.651 --> 19:01.786
Maybe the
half-mile-high club.

19:01.854 --> 19:04.889
Oh, man, they hate us
right now.
Yeah.

19:10.529 --> 19:12.597
It's half an hour
before opening,

19:12.665 --> 19:14.566
and while Ben and Autumn
are hard at work prepping...

19:14.633 --> 19:16.734
I scaled you
some more radishes.

19:16.802 --> 19:19.837
I'm getting these potatoes up.
Go for it.

19:19.905 --> 19:22.473
Holli and Jay finally
arrive in the kitchen.

19:22.541 --> 19:24.242
Hey, guys.

19:24.310 --> 19:26.477
But they do not receive
the warmest of receptions.

19:26.545 --> 19:28.513
Today, when we came back,

19:28.581 --> 19:30.982
Autumn and Ben are
a little bit upset.

19:31.050 --> 19:32.984
What can I do?
Where are you guys?

19:33.052 --> 19:35.620
Um, just finishing touches.

19:35.688 --> 19:36.654
<i>There's nothing else to do?</i>

19:36.722 --> 19:37.922
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:37.990 --> 19:39.991
I'm a better cook than Holli.

19:40.059 --> 19:41.226
I really think that she's
kind of Gotten lucky

19:41.293 --> 19:42.961
and gotten into
kind of a smooth position

19:43.028 --> 19:44.262
where she's kind of
rolling through.

19:44.330 --> 19:47.432
Where is the tempura?
Is this curry salt?

19:47.499 --> 19:50.235
I don't feel the passion
from her. I don't feel it.

19:50.302 --> 19:51.302
All right.
Jeez.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.770
Why are you jumping
like that?

19:52.838 --> 19:54.072
Oh, .

19:54.139 --> 19:57.875
Right.
Well, how was it?

19:57.943 --> 19:59.244
It was amazing, Chef.
It was great.

19:59.311 --> 20:00.278
Did you enjoy
the goodyear blimp? Was it--

20:00.346 --> 20:01.446
yes. Yeah.
<i>Yeah?</i>

20:01.513 --> 20:03.147
And did you spot
a house together?

20:03.215 --> 20:04.616
No.

20:04.683 --> 20:06.184
We did look for a house,
Holli. Let's be honest.

20:06.252 --> 20:07.518
But I don't really want
to live in L.A.

20:07.586 --> 20:10.255
Let's look in London,
okay?

20:10.322 --> 20:11.823
I think Holli's
a little tramp.

20:13.325 --> 20:14.792
I'm so over her.

20:14.860 --> 20:19.497
Okay, here we go. Tonight,
I'm expecting everything to go

20:19.565 --> 20:21.366
<i>smoother than</i>
<i>it's ever gone before.</i>

20:21.433 --> 20:24.669
I've put my ass on the line,
okay, to give away

20:24.737 --> 20:26.871
<i>a head Chef position</i>
<i>at the Savoy grill</i>

20:26.939 --> 20:28.339
based on
the last two services,

20:28.407 --> 20:31.042
<i>trust me, nobody qualified</i>
<i>for the head Chef.</i>

20:31.110 --> 20:33.244
<i>So it has to run</i>
<i>perfectly tonight.</i>

20:33.312 --> 20:34.879
We need to do it.

20:34.947 --> 20:38.483
Now, I'm gonna do something
I've never, ever done before

20:38.550 --> 20:39.684
<i>in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

20:41.654 --> 20:43.521
Never, ever, <i>ever!</i>

20:45.000 --> 20:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:52.475 --> 20:55.510
Minutes before the doors
of Hell's Kitchen open...

20:55.578 --> 20:59.281
I'm gonna do something I've
never, ever done before, ever!

20:59.349 --> 21:01.283
Chef Ramsay is ready
to experiment

21:01.351 --> 21:02.851
with tonight's
dinner service.

21:02.919 --> 21:04.386
I need each
and every one of you

21:04.454 --> 21:06.154
<i>to play to your strengths.</i>

21:06.222 --> 21:07.589
And he's looking
for the Chefs

21:07.657 --> 21:10.025
to control their destiny
a little more than normal.

21:10.093 --> 21:13.495
You decide
amongst yourselves now, okay,

21:13.563 --> 21:14.630
<i>who does what section.</i>

21:14.697 --> 21:15.898
The appetizer,
the fish,

21:15.965 --> 21:16.832
the garnish,
and the meat.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.500
<i>Off you go.</i>

21:18.568 --> 21:20.602
This is huge.

21:20.670 --> 21:24.206
Chef Ramsay never allowed us
to pick our stations before,

21:24.274 --> 21:25.941
so, um, it's definitely
an opportunity

21:26.009 --> 21:28.143
to shine
or miserably fail.

21:28.211 --> 21:29.544
I'd like to do fish.

21:29.612 --> 21:30.679
I'll do garnish.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.780
I'll do apps.

21:31.848 --> 21:32.915
Okay, I'll do roast.

21:32.982 --> 21:35.117
All right. All right.
All right. Go.

21:35.184 --> 21:38.353
I feel like we all chose the
stations we were the best at.

21:40.523 --> 21:42.291
There's no reason, if we
communicate properly,

21:42.358 --> 21:43.825
that we can't have
a perfect service.

21:43.893 --> 21:45.460
All right, where's
the belgian ?

21:45.528 --> 21:47.329
Hey, let's go.

21:47.397 --> 21:49.731
Open up the restaurant, please.
Let's go.

21:59.742 --> 22:03.578
I'm gonna have definitely
the sea scallops.

22:03.646 --> 22:05.347
The lamb Wellington.
All right.

22:05.415 --> 22:06.648
Let's go.
First order.

22:06.716 --> 22:09.117
Okay, guys,
make it count, yes?

22:09.185 --> 22:11.153
Yeah, big time. One order,
three couples, table 22, yes?

22:11.220 --> 22:12.921
Two scallops, two Risotto.

22:12.989 --> 22:18.360
Entree, one duck, one beef,
two Wellington.

22:18.428 --> 22:20.963
Hello?
Where's the energy?

22:21.030 --> 22:22.698
Yes, Chef.
Listen to me, yes?

22:22.765 --> 22:24.766
Yes, Chef.
<i>Thank you.</i>

22:24.834 --> 22:25.834
<i>The fact that you</i>
<i>don't even answer me</i>

22:25.902 --> 22:27.436
when I'm calling out
an order

22:27.503 --> 22:28.804
<i>tells me already you're</i>
<i>not concentrating properly.</i>

22:28.871 --> 22:30.572
No, I'm listening, Chef.
I am looking for a leader.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.707
Yes, Chef.
<i>Let's go.</i>

22:31.774 --> 22:33.275
I'm ready.

22:33.343 --> 22:36.578
Chef Ramsay expects the person
who wins this competition

22:36.646 --> 22:38.914
to be a leader, and I'm gonna
try my damndest

22:38.982 --> 22:41.350
to make sure that my leadership
qualities show through.

22:41.417 --> 22:44.319
Are these ready?
It needs one second.

22:44.387 --> 22:45.887
I need the dory!

22:45.955 --> 22:47.022
Yes, Chef,
it's almost done.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.724
Okay, taking the John dory.

22:48.791 --> 22:50.125
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

22:50.193 --> 22:51.860
I got it.
Oh.

22:51.928 --> 22:53.462
John dory.
Autumn!

22:53.529 --> 22:54.730
Come on, just put it
down there, yes?

22:57.033 --> 22:59.468
I've got three pieces
cooked perfectly

22:59.535 --> 23:01.903
and One raw.
Come on, guys.

23:01.971 --> 23:05.073
Look.
Who took it out?

23:05.141 --> 23:07.576
Who took that dory out?

23:07.643 --> 23:08.710
Autumn, Chef.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.512
Come on.
Yes, Chef.

23:10.580 --> 23:11.747
Autumn pulled that fish out,
and it was raw.

23:11.814 --> 23:13.048
I didn't It up.

23:13.116 --> 23:14.516
Autumn, are you doing that
to sabotage her?

23:14.584 --> 23:15.884
Absolutely not.

23:15.952 --> 23:17.386
Don't take it out
unless it's cooked!

23:17.453 --> 23:19.121
Thank you.

23:19.188 --> 23:20.856
While Holli starts over
on her dory...

23:20.923 --> 23:22.891
How long, Jay?
Coming, Chef, as we speak.

23:22.959 --> 23:25.193
Jay is ready
with his first Risotto.

23:25.261 --> 23:27.095
Risotto, Chef.
Work it, Jay.

23:27.163 --> 23:28.530
Yes, Chef, working hard.

23:28.598 --> 23:30.399
<i>Jay, six minutes?</i>

23:30.466 --> 23:31.666
<i>I can go four minutes</i>
<i>if you're ready.</i>

23:31.734 --> 23:33.201
Come on, seasoning.
A little bit more lemon.

23:33.269 --> 23:35.604
It's bland.
Come on, Now.

23:35.671 --> 23:36.872
I wouldn't call it bland.

23:36.939 --> 23:38.607
I would say slightly
under-seasoned.

23:38.674 --> 23:40.642
Bland means "not good"
to me.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.744
Unbelievable.
!

23:42.812 --> 23:43.979
Chef, I need a minute.
I made it too salty

23:44.047 --> 23:44.946
<i>on the Risotto.</i>

23:46.716 --> 23:48.050
<i>Get it on, another one.</i>
Yes, Chef, it's on, it's on.

23:48.117 --> 23:49.718
At least you had the decency
to Stop it.

23:49.786 --> 23:51.453
Yes, Chef.
<i>Look at me.</i>

23:51.521 --> 23:52.354
<i>Get it right, 'cause,</i>
<i>i mean, you're putting me</i>

23:52.422 --> 23:53.555
<i>in the Here now.</i>

23:53.623 --> 23:54.923
While Jay has maintained

23:54.991 --> 23:56.992
a level of quality control
at his own station,

23:57.060 --> 23:58.627
there's something
at the pass

23:58.694 --> 24:00.395
that has caught
Chef Ramsay's attention.

24:00.463 --> 24:02.097
Hey, Holli.
Yes, Chef.

24:02.165 --> 24:03.999
Holli, look at me.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.867
Those scallops are sauteed
perfectly, yes?

24:05.935 --> 24:07.169
Thank you, Chef.

24:07.236 --> 24:09.204
Oh, !

24:09.272 --> 24:12.240
In normal, everyday kitchens
I've worked in,

24:12.308 --> 24:14.876
I've never had a compliment
yelled at me.

24:14.944 --> 24:16.845
<i>Service, please.</i>

24:16.913 --> 24:18.914
Thanks to Holli and Jay,

24:18.981 --> 24:20.348
diners are enjoying
their appetizers.

24:20.416 --> 24:21.950
Oh, my God.

24:22.018 --> 24:23.351
That is good.

24:23.419 --> 24:25.053
Let's go!

24:25.121 --> 24:27.389
And Chef Ramsay hopes
the trend continues.

24:27.457 --> 24:30.992
Nicely cooked, Jay.
Thank you, Chef.

24:31.060 --> 24:32.461
Let's go. How is everything?
Really good.

24:32.528 --> 24:34.062
<i>Good.</i>
Right behind.

24:34.130 --> 24:36.031
This is hot, Chef.

24:36.099 --> 24:36.832
<i>Keep it going, guys,</i>
<i>please.</i>

24:36.899 --> 24:38.366
Yes, Chef.

24:38.434 --> 24:40.402
Raw.

24:40.470 --> 24:43.438
!
It's undercooked.

24:43.506 --> 24:46.408
<i>It's just a--come on!</i>

24:46.476 --> 24:47.375
<i>I need the dory!</i>

24:47.443 --> 24:49.177
Yes, Chef.

24:49.245 --> 24:50.345
<i>I need that dory</i>
<i>Urgently.</i>

24:50.413 --> 24:51.613
Like, .

24:51.681 --> 24:53.014
One minute, Chef.
<i>Look at me.</i>

24:53.082 --> 24:54.950
You may have spent the afternoon
in the Sky,

24:55.017 --> 24:55.951
<i>but can you come back down</i>
<i>to earth?</i>

24:56.018 --> 24:58.086
Yes, Chef.
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:58.154 --> 25:00.021
The stakes are so high
right now.

25:00.089 --> 25:01.656
I mean,
it's very nerve-racking

25:01.724 --> 25:02.824
knowing that
the littlest mistake

25:02.892 --> 25:04.860
could send you up
for elimination.

25:04.927 --> 25:06.228
Hey, you may be down,
but you're not out.

25:06.295 --> 25:07.662
<i>No, I'm not out.</i>
<i>At least come back.</i>

25:07.730 --> 25:08.730
Well, get your Head
out of your ass then.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.298
My head is out
of my ass, Chef.

25:10.366 --> 25:11.833
Well, lift up a little bit,
will you, yes?

25:11.901 --> 25:14.336
Yes, Chef.

25:14.403 --> 25:16.037
While Holli struggles
to get her John dory right,

25:16.105 --> 25:19.541
Jay is having no trouble
getting food to the pass.

25:19.609 --> 25:20.742
Jay.
<i>Yes, Chef?</i>

25:20.810 --> 25:22.144
Now you're getting
Confused.

25:22.211 --> 25:23.912
Whether it's needed
or not.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.413
You throw me
the potatoes out,

25:25.481 --> 25:27.849
they're not even on order.
Sorry, Chef.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.017
<i>If you cleared that half</i>
<i>In front of you,</i>

25:29.085 --> 25:30.051
<i>you'd stay a lot</i>
<i>more focused.</i>

25:30.119 --> 25:31.219
Yes, Chef.

25:31.287 --> 25:32.354
<i>Sake!</i>

25:32.421 --> 25:33.655
I was trying to go so fast

25:33.723 --> 25:35.457
that I got ahead of myself
by one ticket,

25:35.525 --> 25:36.391
but I'd rather bring up
too much food

25:36.459 --> 25:37.659
than not enough food.

25:37.727 --> 25:38.927
I don't want this
Everywhere.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.395
Yes, Chef.
<i>Show me some finesse, Jay.</i>

25:40.463 --> 25:42.797
My worry about you is, you get
busier but you get sloppy.

25:42.865 --> 25:44.766
Now, Turn it down
a bit, will you, please, yes?

25:44.834 --> 25:46.334
Yes, Chef.

25:46.402 --> 25:48.503
It's 45 minutes
into dinner service,

25:48.571 --> 25:51.006
and while there have been
a few problems in the kitchen,

25:51.073 --> 25:52.941
the dining room
has not been affected.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.210
Enjoy your first course.
Thank you so much.

25:55.278 --> 25:57.579
We're sending appetizers and
entrees at the same time, yes?

25:57.647 --> 25:58.647
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

25:58.714 --> 26:00.315
Two duck,
two beef, two dory.

26:00.383 --> 26:01.783
Look at me. Easy.
<i>Oui,</i> Chef.

26:01.851 --> 26:02.817
<i>Let's go.</i>

26:02.885 --> 26:04.052
Two duck, two beef.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.520
I have a lot to prove

26:05.588 --> 26:07.322
because I hadn't really been
service the last time,

26:07.390 --> 26:09.057
and I want to show Chef
that I can be vocal

26:09.125 --> 26:10.525
and work with the team
to get things done.

26:10.593 --> 26:11.793
<i>Duck, beef, two dory.</i>

26:11.861 --> 26:12.894
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

26:12.962 --> 26:13.995
<i>How long?</i>

26:14.063 --> 26:15.764
How long on the duck
and beef?

26:15.831 --> 26:16.831
<i>Let's go!</i>

26:16.899 --> 26:18.166
Ben.

26:18.234 --> 26:20.468
It was really hard
to get Ben to talk still,

26:20.536 --> 26:22.304
and he just doesn't
communicate very well.

26:22.371 --> 26:24.506
Duck and beef, how long?

26:24.574 --> 26:27.375
How long?
Um, give me a second.

26:27.443 --> 26:28.310
<i>You've gone quiet,</i>
<i>benjamin.</i>

26:28.377 --> 26:29.444
How long?

26:29.512 --> 26:30.812
The ticket
you're coming up with?

26:30.880 --> 26:34.683
No, Chef's asking
for the beef.
Uh...

26:34.750 --> 26:36.785
We're at two minutes,
right, Ben?

26:36.852 --> 26:39.554
Benjamin,
talk to your brigade!

26:39.622 --> 26:42.557
Was that an order, Chef?
I'm sorry.

26:42.625 --> 26:43.692
Hell.

26:43.759 --> 26:45.193
Two duck, two beef.

26:45.261 --> 26:46.261
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:46.329 --> 26:48.597
How long?
The beef?

26:48.664 --> 26:51.600
This is where it gets
really Painful.

26:51.667 --> 26:54.769
You still haven't shown me
that you can talk naturally!

26:54.837 --> 26:56.705
Now, look at me!
Will you Wake up

26:56.772 --> 26:58.607
and talk to your team?

26:58.674 --> 27:02.510
How long?
How long, then?

27:02.578 --> 27:04.879
You have got to do it.
Look at me!

27:04.947 --> 27:06.414
Time is running out
for you!

27:12.585 --> 27:14.519
An hour into dinner service,

27:14.587 --> 27:16.822
Ben has picked a bad time
to go silent.

27:16.889 --> 27:19.124
Now, look at me!
Will you Wake up

27:19.192 --> 27:20.959
and talk to your team?

27:21.027 --> 27:24.529
And Chef Ramsay's patience
has just about run out.

27:24.597 --> 27:25.831
<i>You have got to do it.</i>

27:25.898 --> 27:27.966
Yes, Chef.
<i>Whether you like it or not,</i>

27:28.034 --> 27:29.868
time is running out
for you!

27:29.936 --> 27:31.570
I want to communicate,
and I'm like, uhh!

27:31.638 --> 27:32.771
I know Chef Ramsay's
screaming at me,

27:32.839 --> 27:34.273
and he's getting
frustrated with me,

27:34.340 --> 27:35.907
but it Kills me, 'cause
I know what I have to do.

27:35.975 --> 27:37.609
You can't just
sit there and think!

27:37.677 --> 27:39.411
<i>Open up!</i>

27:39.479 --> 27:41.713
While Benjamin,
for some reason,

27:41.781 --> 27:43.915
is still not ready
to fully communicate,

27:43.983 --> 27:45.817
Autumn is ready
with her garnish.

27:45.885 --> 27:49.254
Two Wellingtons, duck, beef.
Unbelievable.

27:49.322 --> 27:50.656
Autumn!
Yes, Chef?

27:50.723 --> 27:51.890
The spinach is cold
and greasy.

27:51.958 --> 27:55.727
Yes, Chef. Coming right up.
I'm fixing it.

27:55.795 --> 27:57.362
Can I have
some hot garnish?

27:57.430 --> 28:00.098
When your job is to reheat
something, you know,

28:00.166 --> 28:01.633
it really should be hot.

28:01.701 --> 28:05.270
Beef garnish.

28:05.338 --> 28:07.873
<i>Oh, cold spinach again!</i>

28:07.940 --> 28:10.542
It's Cold.
Come on, Autumn, please!

28:10.610 --> 28:12.577
<i>Cold spinach.</i>
<i>No chance.</i>

28:12.645 --> 28:14.313
Come on, Autumn!
Yes, Chef.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.048
You serve me cold spinach
again, madam,

28:16.115 --> 28:17.282
yeah,
you're History.

28:17.350 --> 28:19.051
Yes, Chef.

28:19.118 --> 28:20.319
While Autumn makes a third
attempt on the spinach,

28:20.386 --> 28:22.921
Chef Ramsay turns his attention
to Holli.

28:22.989 --> 28:24.589
I need that dory
Urgently.

28:24.657 --> 28:26.825
The dory's not going out.
It needs one second.

28:26.893 --> 28:29.361
<i>Come on, guys, please.</i>
<i>Ladies!</i>

28:29.429 --> 28:31.563
All right, oil, then.

28:31.631 --> 28:33.332
Too dry. The pan's dry, so
you're scorching the John dory.

28:33.399 --> 28:35.867
There you go. Gonna saute
the John dory, yeah?

28:35.935 --> 28:37.836
Yes, Chef.
Saute. No salt in there.

28:37.904 --> 28:39.071
Come on, Holli, please.
There's salt on that.

28:39.138 --> 28:40.739
Yes. Let's go.
Season. Let's go.

28:40.807 --> 28:42.441
Holli thinks she knows
what she's doing.

28:42.508 --> 28:44.343
She thinks she's probably better
than me or Jay.

28:44.410 --> 28:45.977
She doesn't belong here.
She's over her head.

28:46.045 --> 28:47.512
Holli.
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

28:47.580 --> 28:48.947
Big difference between
sauteing something--

28:49.015 --> 28:51.350
look at me--and scorching
something, thank you.

28:51.417 --> 28:53.218
Yes, Chef.

28:53.286 --> 28:55.053
It's an hour and a half
into dinner service,

28:55.121 --> 28:57.122
and Holli's problems
on the fish station

28:57.190 --> 28:59.358
are slowing entrees
leaving the kitchen,

28:59.425 --> 29:02.828
which means it's time
for Jean-Philippe to do

29:02.895 --> 29:04.162
what he does best.

29:04.230 --> 29:05.931
Oh, can we get some food here
or something?

29:05.998 --> 29:07.599
Yes.
Yes?

29:07.667 --> 29:09.601
We're very hungry.
It should be here shortly.

29:09.669 --> 29:11.603
On order, four,
table 35.

29:11.671 --> 29:13.338
<i>Entree, two monkfish,</i>
<i>one chicken, one beef,</i>

29:13.406 --> 29:15.340
<i>pink medium.</i>
<i>Oui, Chef.</i>

29:15.408 --> 29:18.443
Autumn, look at me.
I'm calling out orders now.

29:18.511 --> 29:19.444
<i>You've not even</i>
<i>acknowledged them.</i>

29:19.512 --> 29:21.079
What did I just call out?

29:21.147 --> 29:22.881
Two Wellington,
two duck, two beef?

29:22.949 --> 29:24.216
Nowhere near it.

29:24.283 --> 29:26.184
Two monkfish, one chicken,
one Beef.

29:26.252 --> 29:28.320
Yes, Chef.
Unbelievable.

29:28.388 --> 29:30.889
I have no freakin' idea.

29:30.957 --> 29:32.824
Guessing is just painful,

29:32.892 --> 29:34.326
because my guesses
are always wrong.

29:34.394 --> 29:35.794
Don't start panicking!

29:35.862 --> 29:37.362
I won't.

29:37.430 --> 29:39.297
Then talk to me.
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

29:39.365 --> 29:40.665
While Autumn is having trouble

29:40.733 --> 29:41.967
holding it together
on garnish...

29:42.034 --> 29:43.301
!

29:43.369 --> 29:44.703
Ben is having the same problem

29:44.771 --> 29:46.071
with his meat.

29:46.139 --> 29:48.507
Wellington urgently!
Benjamin!

29:48.574 --> 29:49.808
My Wellington's
fallen apart, Chef.

29:49.876 --> 29:51.143
<i>What happened?</i>

29:51.210 --> 29:53.011
It fell apart on me, Chef,
when I sliced it.

29:53.079 --> 29:54.813
Slice it with a carving knife,
Benjamin.

29:54.881 --> 29:56.114
Yes, Chef.
<i>Serrated-edge knife.</i>

29:56.182 --> 29:57.783
Come back
for the Wellington.

29:57.850 --> 30:00.919
Ben wasn't holding it
together. I mean,

30:00.987 --> 30:03.855
I have no idea what was going on
in his station.

30:03.923 --> 30:06.558
Not even cooked enough,
is it?
No.

30:06.626 --> 30:08.059
<i>Oui,</i> Chef.
<i>Benjamin.</i>

30:08.127 --> 30:11.596
The Wellington's raw. That's not
even rendered down, yeah.

30:11.664 --> 30:14.699
If it's not ready,
don't send it, Benjamin!

30:14.767 --> 30:15.567
<i>Yes, Chef!</i>

30:18.938 --> 30:21.339
Come on, Benjamin.

30:21.407 --> 30:23.008
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>benjamin, please!</i>

30:23.075 --> 30:25.844
You can't stand there
and gawp at that

30:25.912 --> 30:26.678
<i>and not know</i>
<i>it's not cooked.</i>

30:26.746 --> 30:28.013
It's--it's not cooked yet.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.949
Oh, !
Come on!

30:31.017 --> 30:32.250
What can I do
for you, Ben?

30:32.318 --> 30:33.685
Could you just check
my steaks down below?

30:33.753 --> 30:35.120
Were they medium rare?

30:35.188 --> 30:36.421
Yeah.

30:36.489 --> 30:38.356
No. Still rare.

30:38.424 --> 30:40.325
I strive every day to try
to step up and be a leader.

30:40.393 --> 30:42.561
The duck sauce
is here, Ben.
Thank you.

30:42.628 --> 30:44.796
Hopefully Chef Ramsay
will realize

30:44.864 --> 30:46.131
that there is a leader
amongst us.

30:46.199 --> 30:47.899
You had duck, beef,
and then two Wellington,

30:47.967 --> 30:49.367
<i>and then two chicken.</i>
Yep.

30:49.435 --> 30:50.635
Duck, beef,
two Wellington, two chicken.

30:50.703 --> 30:52.838
I've got my dorys in.
I need three minutes.

30:52.905 --> 30:54.372
Right behind you,
coming down the line.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.174
You shout two minutes?

30:56.242 --> 30:57.209
<i>Now it's sounding</i>
<i>like a kitchen.</i>

30:57.276 --> 30:58.777
Keep it going!
Yes, Chef!

30:58.845 --> 31:00.579
Chef, 2 1/2 minutes.

31:00.646 --> 31:02.247
With the Chefs finally
communicating like a team...

31:02.315 --> 31:04.149
Service, please.

31:04.217 --> 31:06.384
Properly-cooked food is flying
out to grateful customers.

31:06.452 --> 31:07.686
It's very good.

31:07.753 --> 31:10.422
<i>It is really good.</i>

31:10.490 --> 31:12.023
Let's go. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

31:12.091 --> 31:14.493
We're in full motion now.
Standard!

31:14.560 --> 31:15.894
Yes, Chef!

31:15.962 --> 31:16.761
How long you got?
<i>Two minutes.</i>

31:16.829 --> 31:18.196
Two minutes.

31:18.264 --> 31:20.599
That's better.
That's it!

31:20.666 --> 31:23.201
Beef garnish.
Service, please. Let's go.

31:23.269 --> 31:24.636
Slicing duck.

31:24.704 --> 31:27.939
Service, please.
Two truffle salad
right behind it.

31:28.007 --> 31:28.940
Let's go.

31:29.008 --> 31:30.742
I like that.

31:30.810 --> 31:33.378
This is the first time
we've had no food

31:33.446 --> 31:34.713
come back to the kitchen.

31:34.780 --> 31:36.381
Keep it going!
<i>Yes, Chef!</i>

31:36.449 --> 31:38.049
What a cool feeling
that is.

31:38.117 --> 31:40.785
Nothing was sent back.
That's pretty amazing.

31:40.853 --> 31:42.287
Duck, two Wellington
coming up.

31:42.355 --> 31:43.989
Thank you. Nicely cooked,
that Wellington.

31:44.056 --> 31:44.823
<i>Thank you, Chef.</i>

31:44.891 --> 31:46.358
Let's go.

31:46.425 --> 31:47.459
<i>Yes, Chef!</i>

31:47.527 --> 31:49.728
Guys, this is the last
ticket, so hey,

31:49.795 --> 31:51.830
<i>it's in your hands!</i>

31:51.898 --> 31:53.331
Garnish in one.
<i>Garnish in one.</i>

31:53.399 --> 31:55.333
Got a little bit
of a rough start,

31:55.401 --> 31:57.836
but once we got going,
execution was there.

31:57.904 --> 32:00.005
Everyone worked as a team,

32:00.072 --> 32:01.573
and we had a really good
dinner service.

32:01.641 --> 32:03.775
All right,
bringing up garnish.

32:03.843 --> 32:04.809
Beef Wellington, Chef.

32:04.877 --> 32:06.912
Perfect.
That's beautiful.

32:06.979 --> 32:08.647
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Service, please.</i>

32:08.714 --> 32:11.349
Go. Thank you.

32:11.417 --> 32:14.586
Hey, well done,
everybody, yes?

32:14.654 --> 32:16.121
Thank you, Chef.

32:16.188 --> 32:18.523
That is exactly
what we've been looking for.

32:18.591 --> 32:21.159
Well done.
Really well done.

32:21.227 --> 32:23.395
I think I did a good job,

32:23.462 --> 32:24.963
but I feel like I have
just as much of a chance

32:25.031 --> 32:26.965
of going home tonight
as anybody else, I really do.

32:27.033 --> 32:28.066
I just--I'm scared.

32:28.134 --> 32:30.335
Really well done.
Clear down.

32:30.403 --> 32:31.836
Nobody is safe.

32:31.904 --> 32:34.205
After tonight, there will
only be three of us.

32:34.273 --> 32:36.608
I mean, my God,
these stakes are so high,

32:36.676 --> 32:38.076
I can't even
comprehend it.

32:38.144 --> 32:39.544
I don't want to get
any hopes up,

32:39.612 --> 32:41.846
because one of us is still
going home tonight.

32:52.819 --> 32:55.187
Well done.
Really good.

32:55.255 --> 32:58.724
Best dinner service
so far.

32:58.792 --> 33:02.695
We had some issues
and some problems,

33:02.762 --> 33:05.898
but we bounced back.

33:05.965 --> 33:07.900
<i>Here's the bad news.</i>

33:07.967 --> 33:10.602
I'm not looking
for four Chefs.

33:10.670 --> 33:15.207
I'm looking for one.

33:15.275 --> 33:19.044
Jay, you took control
and you led.

33:19.112 --> 33:23.415
Now, don't stop doing that.

33:23.483 --> 33:27.052
Go upstairs and then decide
on the two nominees

33:27.120 --> 33:31.356
that you think are no longer
good enough to stay

33:31.424 --> 33:34.927
in Hell's Kitchen.

33:34.994 --> 33:36.195
This is not
gonna be easy.

33:36.262 --> 33:39.164
Off you go.

33:40.934 --> 33:45.471
I was sort of down, and I went
from zero to hero.

33:45.538 --> 33:46.638
Thank you.

33:46.706 --> 33:48.340
In all honesty,
it's a tough decision.

33:48.408 --> 33:50.442
Usually, someone really
Ed up in the kitchen.

33:50.510 --> 33:52.177
You know, you don't even
have to think about it.

33:52.245 --> 33:53.946
I don't want to go home.

33:54.013 --> 33:55.314
I know.
Nobody does.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.382
<i>Nobody wants to go home.</i>

33:57.450 --> 33:58.517
I don't want to
Go home.

33:58.585 --> 34:01.553
I mean, Autumn,
you're my first choice.

34:01.621 --> 34:03.355
Of course.

34:03.423 --> 34:05.457
I don't feel good about
making a second decision.

34:05.525 --> 34:06.859
<i>I just don't.</i>

34:06.926 --> 34:09.762
This is really hard--harder than
I ever wanted it to be.

34:09.829 --> 34:11.929
I mean, on, like, one hand,
Holli and I have

34:11.998 --> 34:15.067
a personal relationship, and I
would not want to screw it up.

34:15.135 --> 34:17.168
On the other hand, you know,
Ben and I are buddies.

34:17.237 --> 34:19.271
Ben's a really good cook,
but I'm still torn.

34:19.339 --> 34:20.873
I don't know what to do.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.507
I had some really great
services.

34:22.574 --> 34:24.309
<i>You know, Chef said,</i>
<i>"you had perfect services."</i>

34:24.377 --> 34:26.712
And I think I could run it
better than you can.

34:26.780 --> 34:28.580
I don't have too much respect
in Holli as a cook.

34:28.648 --> 34:31.850
Is she at the level of the Chef
at the hotel Savoy? No.

34:31.918 --> 34:33.051
I can do it.
There's no doubt.

34:33.119 --> 34:34.585
There's no doubt
in my Mind.

34:34.654 --> 34:36.755
I think I can run a kitchen.
I know I can run a kitchen.

34:36.822 --> 34:38.623
I know I'm passionate.
I know I have experience.

34:38.690 --> 34:40.359
<i>I love food.</i>
<i>I can cook good food.</i>

34:40.426 --> 34:42.594
Ben, where the Are you
getting this confidence?

34:42.661 --> 34:44.329
Your dinner service sucks.

34:44.397 --> 34:47.699
I feel like it's unfair
to put Holli up there

34:47.766 --> 34:49.268
<i>when she has not</i>
<i>had a bad service</i>

34:49.335 --> 34:50.636
<i>and she's won</i>
<i>the most challenges.</i>

34:50.703 --> 34:51.904
Yeah, but Holli hasn't won
the most challenges.

34:51.971 --> 34:54.005
I've won quite a bit
lately.

34:54.072 --> 34:55.940
I just don't know
what to do.

34:56.009 --> 34:57.209
Like, I think Ben could
easily run a kitchen.

34:57.277 --> 34:59.578
I think Ben is super passionate,
but I think,

34:59.646 --> 35:01.613
based upon performance, I think
you had a better night than Ben.

35:01.681 --> 35:03.682
I'm definitely,
definitely torn.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.551
I mean, I don't know
what to do.

35:05.618 --> 35:07.152
Someone tell me
what to do.

35:07.220 --> 35:08.854
It's your choice, Jay.

35:23.169 --> 35:28.140
Uh, right. Jay, first nominee
and why, please.

35:28.208 --> 35:31.276
The first nominee
is Autumn, Chef.

35:31.344 --> 35:32.878
Autumn.

35:32.946 --> 35:34.346
<i>She's had some</i>
<i>rough services.</i>

35:34.414 --> 35:38.083
Just overall hasn't done
too well here in Hell's Kitchen.

35:38.151 --> 35:40.619
Second nominee and why,
please.

35:44.524 --> 35:48.927
Uh, the second nominee tonight,
Chef, was Ben.

35:48.995 --> 35:50.963
Benjamin.

35:51.030 --> 35:52.397
It's more I chose Holli
not to go up

35:52.465 --> 35:54.433
<i>because she hasn't really</i>
<i>had any bad services.</i>

35:54.500 --> 35:56.368
I guess maybe just
the lesser of two evils.

35:56.436 --> 36:00.639
Benjamin, Autumn,
let's go.

36:03.276 --> 36:06.578
Benjamin,
tell me why you think

36:06.646 --> 36:08.146
you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen.

36:08.214 --> 36:09.648
Chef, I should stay in hell's
kitchen because of my experience

36:09.716 --> 36:10.749
and my passion.

36:10.817 --> 36:12.284
I understand
that my service

36:12.352 --> 36:14.720
was not impeccable tonight
at all,

36:14.787 --> 36:18.624
and I feel that if I pass that
communication hurdle,

36:18.691 --> 36:21.426
I feel that I can take control
and I can do it.

36:21.494 --> 36:23.161
I know I can do it and I thought
I was gonna do it today.

36:23.229 --> 36:24.563
And if you give me another day,
I will.

36:28.034 --> 36:30.469
Autumn, why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

36:32.872 --> 36:34.673
Just trying
to keep it together.

36:34.741 --> 36:37.009
<i>Since I've been</i>
<i>in Hell's Kitchen,</i>

36:37.076 --> 36:38.911
I've been called a princess,

36:38.978 --> 36:41.880
I've been told I don't
like to work hard.

36:41.948 --> 36:45.851
I've been told
that I don't have passion.

36:45.919 --> 36:52.624
But I think the amazing thing
that I'm so proud about

36:52.692 --> 36:54.726
<i>is how I fought</i>
<i>through that,</i>

36:54.794 --> 36:57.829
and I stand here,
completely capable.

36:57.897 --> 36:59.464
<i>I mean, I absolutely</i>
<i>deserve to be here,</i>

36:59.532 --> 37:04.503
and I'm absolutely capable of
running the Savoy grill.

37:04.570 --> 37:07.172
This is difficult.

37:10.009 --> 37:11.944
My decision is...

37:21.011 --> 37:24.080
On the heels of the best
dinner service this year,

37:24.147 --> 37:27.283
Chef Ramsay is about to make
his most difficult decision yet.

37:27.351 --> 37:29.986
My decision is...

37:35.325 --> 37:37.326
Autumn.

37:41.732 --> 37:43.432
Get yourself back in line.

37:48.372 --> 37:50.206
Benjamin.

37:50.273 --> 37:53.075
It's gonna be really hard
for me to say this to you.

37:54.878 --> 37:58.748
Take yourself back in line.

37:58.815 --> 38:01.183
Thank you, Chef.

38:02.986 --> 38:06.822
I can't do it.

38:06.890 --> 38:08.557
None of you deserve
to go home.

38:08.625 --> 38:11.460
<i>To help us celebrate,</i>

38:11.528 --> 38:13.496
<i>i've brought in some</i>
<i>very special guests.</i>

38:16.133 --> 38:18.868
Autumn,

38:18.935 --> 38:21.971
here's your boyfriend Ethan

38:22.039 --> 38:24.507
and your best friend Sasha.

38:30.447 --> 38:32.281
Autumn, take a seat.

38:32.349 --> 38:33.916
Oh, my God.

38:33.984 --> 38:37.753
Hey, Jay, here's mum Judy and
your stepdad Victor. Come in.

38:37.821 --> 38:39.689
Oh, hey, how are you?
Good.

38:39.756 --> 38:41.791
All right.
Looking good.

38:41.858 --> 38:43.693
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you too.

38:43.760 --> 38:48.698
Holli, your four-year-old son
Dylan and his father Phillip.

38:54.237 --> 38:55.538
Nice to see you guys.

38:55.605 --> 38:58.374
Hi, baby.

38:58.442 --> 39:00.776
I've missed you, buggy.

39:03.680 --> 39:07.349
Okay. Ah, Benjamin,
say hello

39:07.417 --> 39:10.286
to your wife rosetta and your
one-year-old daughter Ella.

39:10.353 --> 39:13.255
Hi, hi, hi.

39:13.323 --> 39:16.158
Sit down, Benjamin,
enjoy.

39:16.226 --> 39:19.028
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe
you guys are here.

39:19.096 --> 39:22.732
I'm just so happy to be here,
and to see them

39:22.799 --> 39:26.535
walk through the doors,
it was such a good feeling.

39:26.603 --> 39:29.638
Oh, my God, this competition
is--it's so hard.

39:29.706 --> 39:31.907
It's just been, like,
a roller coaster.

39:31.975 --> 39:34.009
Like, 'cause people
didn't like me

39:34.077 --> 39:35.144
and they were
intimidated by me,

39:35.212 --> 39:36.045
so they just kept
nominating me.

39:37.547 --> 39:38.614
You can make it.

39:38.682 --> 39:41.383
I'm so happy
to see you guys.

39:43.386 --> 39:45.454
It's been so tough.

39:45.522 --> 39:47.289
The only thing I love
more than cooking

39:47.357 --> 39:48.691
is my wife and my child.

39:48.759 --> 39:51.227
Oh, you're so beautiful.
You are so beautiful.

39:51.294 --> 39:53.162
Ah.

39:53.230 --> 39:54.597
When you're doing a challenge
and you're there with Chef,

39:54.664 --> 39:56.398
like, I don't think
of my wife.

39:56.466 --> 39:58.033
I don't think of my child.
I think of cooking.

39:58.101 --> 40:01.537
But all the time in between,
I think of them.

40:01.605 --> 40:04.907
She's so big.
You're so big.

40:04.975 --> 40:06.809
I don't even know
where to begin.

40:06.877 --> 40:08.511
It's been insane.

40:08.578 --> 40:09.945
What could I have
asked for more, you know,

40:10.013 --> 40:11.180
than to see my family?

40:11.248 --> 40:13.816
If this place
is not emotional enough,

40:13.884 --> 40:15.551
that just brought it
to a whole new level.

40:15.619 --> 40:17.286
This is the hardest thing
I've ever done

40:17.354 --> 40:19.054
and the best thing
I've ever done.
Yep.

40:19.122 --> 40:20.489
But...
And it'll be
the most rewarding.

40:20.557 --> 40:22.658
What a trip.

40:22.726 --> 40:24.760
I missed you.

40:24.828 --> 40:27.229
I would just kill
to go to London

40:27.297 --> 40:28.697
and be the Chef
of the Savoy.

40:34.538 --> 40:37.139
It's just hard.

40:37.207 --> 40:39.141
Time to say good night.

40:39.209 --> 40:41.710
Good to see you guys.

40:44.114 --> 40:45.614
We'll see you soon, honey.

40:45.682 --> 40:47.850
I'm so proud.

40:47.918 --> 40:49.485
I love you.

40:49.553 --> 40:52.221
I can't wait to see you
at home.

40:52.289 --> 40:55.124
We're proud of you.

40:55.192 --> 40:57.226
It's all right.

40:57.294 --> 40:59.528
Sorry to cry, bubbo.

40:59.596 --> 41:01.564
But I just missed you
so much.

41:01.631 --> 41:04.633
Hug mama.
Give hugs.

41:04.701 --> 41:07.403
Right now, it's hard.

41:07.470 --> 41:09.939
It's the longest I've ever
been away from him,

41:10.006 --> 41:13.576
and it's the frickin'
hardest part.

41:19.950 --> 41:23.586
<i>Jay, Benjamin,</i>
<i>holli, Autumn,</i>

41:23.653 --> 41:25.521
I'm gonna push the boundaries
out even further.

41:25.589 --> 41:28.958
I'm gonna turn it up
another notch.

41:29.025 --> 41:30.159
Is that clear?

41:30.227 --> 41:31.193
Yes, Chef.

41:31.261 --> 41:33.028
Good night.

41:33.096 --> 41:36.298
I'm gonna really push myself
to win this competition.

41:36.366 --> 41:37.933
The success always lies
within myself,

41:38.001 --> 41:39.869
not anybody else.

41:39.936 --> 41:41.670
You know, not only did I
not get eliminated,

41:41.738 --> 41:44.273
but I got to see my boyfriend
and my best friend,

41:44.341 --> 41:46.876
and it was such a big boost
for me.

41:46.943 --> 41:49.979
It just makes me want to work
even harder.

41:50.046 --> 41:51.780
I mean, I want my parents
to be proud of me,

41:51.848 --> 41:53.649
so it just fires me up
even more.

41:53.717 --> 41:55.084
Like, I want to come home
the winner.

41:55.151 --> 41:56.852
If I were to win,

41:56.920 --> 41:58.921
I think my son
would be very proud,

41:58.989 --> 42:01.924
'cause I am doing this
for him,

42:01.992 --> 42:04.059
and that's all
I can think about.

42:04.127 --> 42:06.328
I decided to let
all the Chefs

42:06.396 --> 42:08.230
enjoy tonight's
successful dinner service,

42:08.298 --> 42:09.932
but what they don't know is,

42:10.000 --> 42:11.233
after the next
dinner service,

42:11.301 --> 42:15.704
I'll be cutting the field
in half.

42:15.772 --> 42:17.907
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

42:17.974 --> 42:20.142
Jay, Benjamin,
Autumn, and Holli

42:20.210 --> 42:21.877
fight it out for a place
in the finals.

42:21.945 --> 42:23.445
I'm starting
to get mad now.

42:23.513 --> 42:24.446
I really want to throw
a pan at him.

42:24.514 --> 42:25.748
Why would you do that?

42:25.815 --> 42:27.516
It just fires me up
even more.

42:27.584 --> 42:28.817
Chef Ramsay is true
to his word

42:28.885 --> 42:30.853
as the Chefs face their
toughest challenge yet.

42:30.921 --> 42:32.955
I wasn't sure of the protein,

42:33.023 --> 42:33.956
so I was going to
cook all three off.

42:34.024 --> 42:34.890
In the end,

42:34.958 --> 42:36.125
two Chefs will be going home.

42:36.192 --> 42:37.226
You don't deserve
a chance at the finals.

42:37.294 --> 42:38.961
You all right?
<i>No.</i>

42:39.029 --> 42:40.829
I could win this.

42:40.897 --> 42:43.132
And one Chef may not even
make it to dinner service.

42:43.199 --> 42:44.333
I don't think I can do it.

42:44.401 --> 42:45.701
I'm a little nervous
about my health.

42:45.769 --> 42:48.037
You're throwing away
something you may regret.

42:48.104 --> 42:49.672
Find out which two
will survive...

42:49.739 --> 42:51.206
One of you is gonna
become the head Chef

42:51.274 --> 42:52.942
at the Savoy grill
in London.

42:53.009 --> 42:54.743
...And which two will be
going home.

42:54.811 --> 42:56.578
Congratulations to...

42:56.778 --> 43:01.278
