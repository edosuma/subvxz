12:09.990 --> 12:11.426
Where are you guys?

12:11.469 --> 12:12.732
RILEY: Well,
with the Phoenix on lockdown,

12:12.775 --> 12:14.255
we're working
out of Taylor's fancy hangar.

12:14.298 --> 12:14.995
Any update

12:15.038 --> 12:16.126
on Andrews's release?

12:16.170 --> 12:18.302
MATTY: Bad news.
Despite my reassurance

12:18.346 --> 12:20.478
that he would be closely guardedand promptly returned,

12:20.522 --> 12:23.525
the FBI director
denied my request.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.657
I don't disagree. Y'all saw what
that guy can do with a chain.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.877
If we don't show proof we have
Andrews, they'll kill Taylor.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.793
Riley, any luck tracing
the kidnapper's message?

12:30.837 --> 12:33.709
Nope. I got to wait
until they make contact again.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.277
Okay, well, nobody says
we can't talk to Andrews,

12:36.320 --> 12:37.887
ask who he thinks
is behind this.

12:37.931 --> 12:41.238
Talking. Definitely a start.

12:41.282 --> 12:45.329
Yeah. And I'm pretty sure we
can cook up a surprise finish.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.207
[lock buzzes]

12:53.250 --> 12:55.339
He's not restrained?

13:01.693 --> 13:04.435
[door closes, lock buzzes]

13:04.479 --> 13:05.915
MacGYVER:
Hello.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.482
My name is
Angus MacGyver.

13:07.525 --> 13:10.572
And I'm sure you're
wondering why I'm here.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.492
O-Or not.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.026
Mr. MacGyver.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.202
Thank you for your patience,

13:32.246 --> 13:34.639
allowing me to finish
my meditation.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.774
"This is
the only path,

13:38.818 --> 13:42.430
"and there is none other
for the purity of vision.

13:42.473 --> 13:46.434
Follow this path;
it will bewilder Mara."

13:46.477 --> 13:49.089
Siddhartha Gautama. The Buddha.

13:49.132 --> 13:52.396
Buddha called the tempter Mara.

13:52.440 --> 13:56.879
Others call it
jinn, Iblis, Satan.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.228
Ma.

13:58.272 --> 14:01.362
Just fancy names
for the devil.

14:02.754 --> 14:06.584
We humans love to blame
our basest tendencies

14:06.628 --> 14:10.980
on a force outside of
ourselves, but in reality,

14:11.024 --> 14:14.941
that insatiable voice
is always your own,

14:14.984 --> 14:18.988
warring within you,
driving you...

14:20.076 --> 14:24.254
...to take life or to save it.

14:24.298 --> 14:29.781
So, Mr. MacGyver, what
brings you to my humble abode?

14:29.825 --> 14:33.307
My colleague...

14:33.350 --> 14:34.961
his name is Russel Taylor.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.658
He's been taken.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.486
His kidnappers
demanded you in exchange.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.099
ANDREWS:
I've never met him.

14:43.143 --> 14:46.059
But then, I've been in custody
since 1985

14:46.102 --> 14:48.713
and we traitors

14:48.757 --> 14:50.672
don't get a lot
of visitors.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.500
Breathing rhythm, heart
rate, pupil dilation

14:52.543 --> 14:54.023
all indicate
he's telling the truth.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.982
Would you happen to know
of anyone who would

14:56.025 --> 14:57.461
want to secure
your freedom?

14:57.505 --> 15:00.377
Maybe old allies
in Vietnam? The Yards?

15:02.466 --> 15:04.468
No one wants me free.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.383
Not even me.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.430
I'm sorry
I couldn't

15:09.473 --> 15:11.432
help you find your friend.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.824
See, uh,

15:12.868 --> 15:14.304
the truth is, you still can.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.827
How would you like
to get out of here?

15:15.871 --> 15:18.134
See daylight for the first time
in 35 years?

15:21.355 --> 15:24.662
Mr. MacGyver, it has taken
me years of practice

15:24.706 --> 15:27.839
to quell the rage within me.

15:27.883 --> 15:31.321
I put General Ma to death.

15:31.365 --> 15:36.674
It's in everybody's best
interest to keep him buried.

15:40.635 --> 15:41.853
We should wrap this up.

15:41.897 --> 15:42.942
Take it away, Riley.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.683
One minute, folks.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.250
Well, thank you for your time.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.817
Enjoy your painting.

15:48.860 --> 15:49.861
Thank you.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.385
[lock buzzes]

15:55.693 --> 15:58.044
[door closes, lock buzzes]

16:04.311 --> 16:06.356
MacGYVER:You want to try one
of those art classes

16:06.400 --> 16:09.881
where you paint
and drink wine?

16:09.925 --> 16:11.796
No. Of course not.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.624
Paint has been used
throughout the ages

16:13.668 --> 16:16.366
to create the world's
most beautiful masterpieces.

16:16.410 --> 16:17.889
But under the right conditions,

16:17.933 --> 16:20.805
like when it's combined
with bleach and acetone,

16:20.849 --> 16:23.373
the paint reveals the toxic side of its personality,

16:23.417 --> 16:25.636
as it transforms
into chloroform.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.117
[brush clatters]

16:32.817 --> 16:33.905
[lock buzzes]

16:33.949 --> 16:36.038
[alarm blaring] Remind me why

16:36.082 --> 16:39.041
Riley tripping the alarms
was the best plan again?

16:39.085 --> 16:40.390
When Helman breached
the black site,

16:40.434 --> 16:42.827
I helped redesign
the security system,

16:42.871 --> 16:44.568
which was adopted by federal
prisons around the country.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.353
So now, when it goes
on lockdown,

16:46.396 --> 16:48.181
no one can get in
or out of their floor.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.226
Including the guards--
Right here.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.489
Thanks.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.493
Des, we're in a supply closet.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.061
Yes. Thank you very much,Captain Obvious.[lock clicks]

16:59.105 --> 17:01.107
What does the closet
have to do with your plan?

17:03.544 --> 17:05.546
[tires screeching]

17:06.808 --> 17:08.114
[Andrews groans]

17:08.157 --> 17:09.680
Whoa. What did you do?

17:11.160 --> 17:12.466
Just getting
some fresh air.

17:12.509 --> 17:13.641
Smile.

17:15.164 --> 17:16.687
Uh, Bozer,
I'm sending you proof that

17:16.731 --> 17:17.906
we have Andrews in our custody
and he's alive.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.082
Copy that. Riley
jammed the Feds' comms

17:20.126 --> 17:21.388
to buy you a head start.

17:21.431 --> 17:22.911
RILEY:
I'm monitoring the situation

17:22.954 --> 17:24.130
and I'll keep you updated
on the pursuit.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.088
But for now, lay low.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.829
What-- Who is he talking to?Uh-uh!

17:27.872 --> 17:30.136
I can still shoot you while
I'm driving. Sit back.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.920
ANDREWS:
Mr. MacGyver,
please take me

17:31.963 --> 17:33.095
back to jail.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.924
I'm a very dangerous man.

17:35.967 --> 17:39.188
I don't know how long I can
resist the urge to kill you.

17:39.232 --> 17:42.496
I don't know
who took your friend

17:42.539 --> 17:45.368
or why they want me.
I'm telling the truth.

17:45.412 --> 17:48.328
I believe you.
I just don't really care.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.373
What you did back there,

17:50.417 --> 17:52.288
with my paints,

17:52.332 --> 17:54.421
you could use
that for good.

17:54.464 --> 17:57.119
Instead you knock me out
and kidnap me?

17:57.163 --> 17:58.816
Well, that's kind of
his specialty.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.340
What?

18:00.383 --> 18:02.255
It's a compliment, okay?
You're good at knocking

18:02.298 --> 18:04.213
people unconscious.[chuckles]:
Okay.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.999
I thought you forgave me.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.787
Is that why you say no
to all my date ideas?

18:12.830 --> 18:14.136
No, I did forgive you.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.357
I just don't like
fishing or painting.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.402
Oh, you betrayed her.

18:19.446 --> 18:20.969
[gasps]

18:21.012 --> 18:25.974
Oh, betrayal is a difficult one
to forgive.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.672
Especially with all that rage

18:28.716 --> 18:30.935
bottled up
inside you.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.589
Like a powder keg
about to blow.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.852
Oh, really? Cause you've been
such a ray of sunshine lately.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.332
[sighs]

18:36.376 --> 18:40.989
Buddha has a mantra
I think would be very helpful.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.947
"Speak not harshly..."

18:42.991 --> 18:44.166
You know what?
Enough armchair philosophy.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.254
Shut up.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.648
Both of you.

19:00.704 --> 19:01.923
[camera whirs]

19:05.709 --> 19:06.971
Read this.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.149
Would you mind
coming a bit closer?

19:10.192 --> 19:12.107
Close enough?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.456
Mm.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.375
My name is Russ Taylor.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.682
Respond to this message
with confirmation

19:21.725 --> 19:27.731
that you have USMC-1856707.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.258
Or you watch me die.

19:32.301 --> 19:33.694
Sending the picture of Andrews.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.044
And I'm running a trace.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.437
Mr. MacGyver,

19:37.480 --> 19:39.352
like I said, I'm sorry

19:39.395 --> 19:40.701
about your friend, but please,

19:40.744 --> 19:42.746
can you take me back
to the prison now?

19:42.790 --> 19:44.008
[computer chimes]

19:44.052 --> 19:45.401
The kidnappers replied
with the time

19:45.445 --> 19:47.055
and location for the exchange.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.013
It's an abandoned
auto repair plant in Vernon.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.538
You have less than an hour.Copy that. Got it.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.061
RILEY:
Guys, check this out.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.846
The software used
to record digital video

19:55.890 --> 19:57.370
adds half a second
head as a buffer.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.416
I recovered a piece from
before Taylor started reading.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.159
I got an image of the kidnapper.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.250
No.

20:09.686 --> 20:10.992
That's Roman.

20:11.035 --> 20:13.212
What?

20:13.255 --> 20:15.126
But if Roman's alive...Then Codex

20:15.170 --> 20:16.911
is somehow involved
in his kidnapping.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.566
What does Leland
and Codex want with you?

20:19.609 --> 20:21.132
Leland?

20:28.270 --> 20:30.272
I did some digging into
Andrews' time in Vietnam

20:30.316 --> 20:32.318
and I found this.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.189
Check out his
commanding officer.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.111
Leland.

20:43.154 --> 20:44.286
ANDREWS:
Leland was my C.O.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.853
in Nam.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.159
Then years later,
he shows up.

20:48.203 --> 20:51.598
He said he had a gig working for
people who gave him a purpose.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.513
Had this mantra.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.865
"What was is lost,
but from death comes life"?

20:57.908 --> 20:59.301
Sounds about right.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.825
Said he wanted me to join.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.305
But I refused.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.959
What does Leland
want from you now?

21:05.002 --> 21:07.918
Last time I saw him was 1985.
I-I don't know.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.746
The year you were arrested.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.574
I'm guessing
it's not a coincidence?

21:11.618 --> 21:13.054
You are correct.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.752
Leland tracked
me down in Nam.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.972
He needed my skill set.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.756
It was a
high-profile target.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.933
Innocents were involved,
so I said no.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.718
That's where
I drew the line.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.634
Leland carried
it out himself,

21:27.677 --> 21:31.246
but then pinned it on me.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.248
Up until that point,

21:33.292 --> 21:35.903
the U.S. government
left me alone, but...

21:35.946 --> 21:39.298
they couldn't ignore
Leland's bloodbath.

21:39.341 --> 21:40.516
But brought you in instead.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.737
It's taken me many years
to let go

21:43.780 --> 21:46.305
of my anger at his betrayal.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.139
[beeps]

21:59.666 --> 22:02.277
Look, whatever
you're asking for,

22:02.321 --> 22:03.670
I assure you,

22:03.713 --> 22:05.324
I can pay a lot more.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.500
And I assure you...

22:08.544 --> 22:10.546
...I can't be bought.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.463
Greetings, Russel.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.683
Lovely to see you again.

22:16.726 --> 22:19.294
Leland.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.122
[laughs]

22:21.165 --> 22:22.689
My offer still stands.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.212
I'd take it if I were you.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.954
Leland is notorious for
terminating his employees

22:26.997 --> 22:29.130
once they've outlived
their usefulness.

22:29.173 --> 22:30.392
I'll take my chances.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.916
Hmm. So...

22:32.960 --> 22:35.528
why am I here, hmm?

22:35.571 --> 22:37.399
If you're trying to
recruit me again,

22:37.443 --> 22:39.706
I hate to break it to you,
but my answer now,

22:39.749 --> 22:42.273
and always, is a big fat no.

22:42.317 --> 22:45.581
When Gwen blew herself up

22:45.625 --> 22:49.542
to save her sister's spawn...

22:49.585 --> 22:53.328
she had something of mine
on her: a scepter.

22:54.503 --> 22:57.158
We scoured the wreckage
to no avail.

22:57.201 --> 23:01.467
Which means that
Phoenix must have taken it.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.990
None of this is ringing
any bells, darling.

23:03.033 --> 23:06.123
Good thing I brought along a toy
to help jog your memory.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.780
Hello.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.347
Matty, Riley, we got a problem.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.958
This is Mac and Desi.

23:15.002 --> 23:16.612
And these are FBI patrol cars.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.310
They've locked in on a signal
inside of their car.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.269
Their comms are off,
I encrypted their GPS.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.271
It's impossible to hack.

23:23.314 --> 23:24.446

that it was decorative,

that Leland went to
