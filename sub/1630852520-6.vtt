WEBVTT

00:00.634 --> 00:02.434
(floors squeaking)

00:02.569 --> 00:04.703
- We know adam gentle
laundered money

00:04.772 --> 00:06.705
For a number of different
criminal enterprises.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.273
- Before he was killed,
adam implied

00:08.342 --> 00:09.508
That there was a new alliance.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.809
- The coyotes.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.511
- It sounds more like
a conspiracy theory.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.146
- I found something
in adam's file.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.713
Okay, can you look up
will french, please?

00:15.750 --> 00:17.048
- I wasn't completely honest
with you earlier.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.317
That night that cop got shot,

00:18.452 --> 00:20.485
Some guy paid me 200
to set off some fireworks

00:20.521 --> 00:23.122
By that shottipper thingy.
(duff): Look like him?

00:23.257 --> 00:26.091
<i> (sam): This is will french,</i>
<i> park bench real estate mogul.</i>

00:26.093 --> 00:27.859
<i> He owns an empty house</i>
<i> in port credit where we found</i>

00:27.895 --> 00:30.095
<i> The remnants of a possible</i>
<i> coyote drug lab.</i>

00:30.231 --> 00:32.064
<i> (naz): So, this little piece</i>
<i>of pink rubber that you found...</i>

00:32.133 --> 00:33.398
<i> (duff): Cocaine?</i>

00:33.401 --> 00:34.666
- This guy I know, tobin,

00:34.668 --> 00:36.034
<i> He just gets me to move stuff,</i>

00:36.070 --> 00:37.268
<i>Like, pick up and deliver stuff.</i>

00:37.304 --> 00:38.570
- Are you gonna
tell me why you...

00:38.705 --> 00:40.138
(sighing)
...Graced toronto

00:40.174 --> 00:41.406
With your presence?
- I'm pregnant.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.740
- I'm pregnant.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.442
Think you owe me
100 bucks, kelly.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.712
You always said you'd be
the first one to be pregnant.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.280
(indistinct chatter)

00:54.321 --> 00:56.088
(soft music)

01:01.462 --> 01:04.329
(duff): Come on. No, no!

01:05.099 --> 01:06.364
I put them on the hook.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.500
I always put my keys
on the hook.

01:08.635 --> 01:10.235
- Not always. Remember that time

01:10.237 --> 01:11.837
You found them
in your rubber boots?

01:11.839 --> 01:13.771
- Oh, thank you.
- Ah.

01:13.808 --> 01:15.774
Apparently, I need
to be careful today.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.642
- Careful of what?
- Who knows?

01:17.678 --> 01:20.779
Pot holes, falling pianos,
getting my heart broken.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.514
(groaning)
- oh, yeah.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.649
- You, on the other hand,
let's see...

01:24.685 --> 01:26.718
"trust in the universe, scorpio.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.854
Today's sun in saturn
will reveal the truth

01:28.989 --> 01:30.856
And make your path
easy to follow."

01:30.858 --> 01:32.791
And your path leads right
back to bed

01:32.926 --> 01:35.460
With a handsome and devoted
partner from your past.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.396
- Nice try.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.531
- Ah, interesting.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.267
You may have trouble keeping
track of minutiae today,

01:42.402 --> 01:44.336
But when in doubt,
check the freezer.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.072
Check the freezer?
What does that mean?

01:47.074 --> 01:50.008
- Okay. Len, if you know
where my keys are,

01:50.044 --> 01:51.409
Please tell me.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.945
- Babe. I'm telling you
what the stars say.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.484
- Fine.
- Hmm.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.824
- What the...

02:07.094 --> 02:08.994
Oh, no, len, that's not funny.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.430
Get up, please.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.864
Open it.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.600
(keys clinking)

02:16.837 --> 02:19.904
It's my grandma's. She always
wanted you to have it.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.439
Kelly marie duff,

02:21.441 --> 02:23.842
I know this may seem fast...
- And impulsive!

02:23.977 --> 02:26.044
And insane, but...

02:27.148 --> 02:29.847
Len, what happened to us
taking things slow?

02:29.884 --> 02:31.717
- We don't have time to waste.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.385
We'll buy a house,
we'll have the kids.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.521
What are we waiting for?
This was always our plan.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.390
- Yeah, but--
- look, look.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.857
I have loved you
for five years straight,

02:39.894 --> 02:42.060
And that has never changed.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.463
I've changed, a lot.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.466
Thank god, but that part of me
never did.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.934
- Okay. Can you please
just get up?

02:49.003 --> 02:50.635
Please, you look crazy.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.404
- Ow, ow.
(laughing)

02:52.539 --> 02:54.872
You need a carpet.
- I know.

02:54.909 --> 02:56.608
(sighing)
- kelly, seriously.

02:56.644 --> 02:59.211
We're good together. I know
we've been through a lot, but...

02:59.346 --> 03:02.581
Let's dive in, let's do it.
Let's get married.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.416
- Oh, no...

03:06.053 --> 03:07.752
(sighing)

03:08.923 --> 03:11.789
- Mmm. This is nice,
I like that.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.360
But I'm sensing...

03:17.131 --> 03:19.097
- Ow.
- ...A little ambivalence.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.700
- Yeah, len, I'm just...

03:21.702 --> 03:23.869
Len...
- It's fine.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.305
Okay? I get it.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.707
Take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.942
Alright?

03:31.245 --> 03:34.512
I'll just take this.
We'll put this right here.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.515
- Okay.
- So you don't forget.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.317
(rhythmic music)

03:45.092 --> 03:48.226
<i> ♪ oh I ♪</i>

03:50.898 --> 03:53.398
<i> ♪ I wanna be with you</i>
<i> everywhere ♪</i>

03:55.068 --> 03:56.535
- Yo, I need a job.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.003
Hey, how does one go about
getting one of those, barb?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.472
- A legal, real job?

04:00.541 --> 04:03.808
- Or, you know, a real,
legal job. I'm not picky.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.278
- You ready to go clean, jack?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.613
(sighing)
- I think so.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.216
- Well, trust me,
if I can do it, you can do it.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.618
It's not easy,
but it's way better.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.021
- Hey.
- Hey!

04:17.057 --> 04:19.624
Ask shanika for help.
What's your new gig again?

04:19.660 --> 04:23.061
- Oh, it's...
It's at a coffee shop.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.562
Bean. Bags.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.964
Bean bags, over on dundas.
- Bean bags, oh, that's funny.

04:27.001 --> 04:29.634
I haven't heard of that one.
Must be new.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.671
- Hey, what's in the suitcase?
- Change of clothes.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.173
Being around coffee all day
makes you smell. (chuckling)

04:35.209 --> 04:37.042
- Listen, put in a good
word for jack.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.510
Maybe she can get some shifts.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.979
- I offered, but she said no.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.315
- Oh! Too square for you,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.750
The service industry?
Too good-girl?

04:46.420 --> 04:47.619
- I'm trying to be good.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.520
- Good girls are boring.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.255
- Better safe than sorry.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.926
Have a good day at work.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.928
(door opening and closing)

04:57.998 --> 04:59.931
(siren blaring in the distance)

04:59.967 --> 05:01.900
- Here we go.

05:01.902 --> 05:05.236
Okay, before we go in,
can I... Can I just see, please?

05:06.239 --> 05:07.739
Please, just give
your mother a gift.

05:08.909 --> 05:09.941
Amazing.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.343
- Okay, quit it.
- No, it's true.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.011
I wish they had pepy
when I was a kid.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.246
- This is the dorkiest thing
that's ever happened to me.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.882
- Well, I think you're baller.
No? Balling.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.216
Is that what you say?
You say "balls"?

05:18.218 --> 05:19.551
How do you use it?
- You don't.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.954
So, 40 hours of this,
and then you're gonna pay

05:22.990 --> 05:24.622
For my university
and everything?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.658
- Yeah, if you don't get kicked
out or embarrass me.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.794
- That wasn't part of the terms.
- It was a given!

05:28.929 --> 05:30.829
Now, listen, I had to pull
strings to get you in here

05:30.898 --> 05:33.297
On such short notice.
Okay? So be good.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.499
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:34.634 --> 05:35.600
Have fun.
- Yeah.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.235
- Yeah.
(sighing)

05:40.207 --> 05:41.706
- Okay.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.142
(rhythmic music)

05:50.617 --> 05:52.250
Who's in charge here?

05:53.253 --> 05:55.319
- I just put them on
this morning.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.456
I need to find it before
I'm stuck babysitting all day.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.658
- You're not babysitting.
Pepy's an important program.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.660
- Easy for you to say,
you're not the one who's been

06:02.696 --> 06:04.462
Sidelined to teach teenagers.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.998
- Hey. You'll get back
out there soon.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.402
You sure you lost it?
You're not stalling?

06:10.471 --> 06:13.405
- Nathan! These are really
special earrings, I...

06:13.474 --> 06:15.941
- Got it!
(sighing)

06:18.278 --> 06:20.178
- Oh, my god. Thank you.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.681
(chuckling)

06:22.683 --> 06:24.683
Ah, I thought this earring
was lost forever.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.851
(sighing)

06:28.488 --> 06:30.855
- See you tonight, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.625
Good morning, kelly.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.127
- Oh, hey.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.232
- That could be it.
Hey, we just got word.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.034
Will french sold
the port credit house

06:43.036 --> 06:44.369
Where the drugs
were being converted.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.438
- Damn. That fast?
- Doesn't matter,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.039
That location was dead anyway.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.707
We had surveillance
on it for weeks.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.709
Nobody ever saw another drop.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.445
- Any idea where they're
processing the drugs now?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.380
- Not yet. We looked
into his new properties,

06:55.515 --> 06:57.115
His businesses,
even his vehicle leases.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.484
No suspicious activity.
Guy's clean as a whistle.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.586
- No one's that clean.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.221
What about family,
any skeletons in the closet?

07:03.223 --> 07:05.457
- We couldn't find much
about him before 2015.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.392
Except we do know that
he's the guardian

07:07.527 --> 07:09.194
Of his younger sister, adeline.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.730
But check this out,
he's her conservator.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.998
- Like britney spears?
- Yeah, exactly.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.268
Turns out adeline liked
to party a little too much,

07:16.403 --> 07:17.669
Couldn't take care of herself.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.136
So now, will french

07:19.173 --> 07:20.605
Controls everything
that she does.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.673
- Is she his weak spot?
- I've been working him.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.410
He's tightlipped and protective
of her. So, possibly.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.012
- Is he beginning to trust you?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.814
- He thinks I'm a doctor
with shade,

07:28.949 --> 07:30.348
But he hasn't
spilled anything yet.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.017
I know he's been divorced
a couple of times.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.686
- He's been married three times
in the last five years.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.288
Can you imagine that?

07:36.423 --> 07:37.756
- I think he likes
getting married

07:37.758 --> 07:39.090
More than he likes
being married.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.958
- I'm an idiot. I mean,
it makes me feel better

07:40.994 --> 07:43.160
About my one failed marriage.
- And my one failed marriage!

07:43.197 --> 07:44.563
- Up top.
- Yes!

07:44.565 --> 07:46.297
- Okay, can you guys stop
saying that word, please?

07:46.366 --> 07:47.999
- Which one? Marriage?
- Yes. The more times

07:48.001 --> 07:49.300
You say it, it just
starts sounding funny.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.002
- Let me try.
Marriage, marriage, marriage...

07:51.137 --> 07:54.038
(naz): Marr-iage...
(sam): Mirage! Mirage!

07:54.074 --> 07:55.307
You're right.
(overlapping chatter)

07:55.442 --> 07:56.374
That does sound weird.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.075
- Stop!

07:59.246 --> 08:00.645
- Okay...

08:00.647 --> 08:02.180
We also talked
to all of his exes,

08:02.249 --> 08:03.782
Each one hates him more
than the last.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.717
- Although none of them knew
anything criminal about will.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.185
If we learned anything
from them, it's like,

08:07.320 --> 08:08.753
Don't get married!
- Don't do it!

08:08.889 --> 08:10.121
(laughing)
- hey, guys.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.255
- So stupid!

08:11.291 --> 08:13.190
- Can we get back
to business, please?

08:14.495 --> 08:16.127
Alright, now, if we're gonna
find out why will paid dane

08:16.129 --> 08:18.263
To set off the shottipper,
we need to get closer to him,

08:18.265 --> 08:20.398
For real. Find out
who's calling the shots,

08:20.434 --> 08:22.066
Who he's taking orders from.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.301
- But how? We have nothing.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.869
- I didn't think I would
ever say this,

08:24.938 --> 08:27.271
But here I am, and here I go.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.408
The green team
have done us proud today.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.478
Yeah, exactly. I'm not kidding,
even in the slightest.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.913
In a city where weed is legal,

08:35.949 --> 08:38.750
They have managed to seek out
and apprehend

08:38.819 --> 08:41.686
A major haul
and a ring of drug dealers.

08:41.821 --> 08:44.356
Meanwhile, you,
four of our best and brightest,

08:44.358 --> 08:47.359
Are languishing
in this stagnant room,

08:47.361 --> 08:50.161
Doing nothing
to stop the coyotes

08:50.297 --> 08:53.431
From importing cartel cocaine
and preying on our witnesses.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.700
- Oh, wow. That was a very
eloquent speech, sir,

08:55.769 --> 08:57.435
But until recently,
you didn't even believe

08:57.504 --> 08:59.571
The coyotes existed.
- Well, until recently,

08:59.706 --> 09:01.372
You hadn't proved they existed.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.841
- Okay. Either way,

09:02.976 --> 09:05.110
What does the green team bust
have to do with our case?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.978
- Your suitcases.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.047
A bunch of them,
at the bus station right now,

09:09.116 --> 09:11.316
They can't keep
the dogs off of them.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.551
(barking)

09:12.686 --> 09:14.352
(indistinct chatter)

09:18.425 --> 09:19.658
(sighing)

09:19.793 --> 09:21.592
- Right here?
- Mm-hmm.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.928
(indistinct pa announcement)

09:25.132 --> 09:27.132
- Oh, wow. What do you know!

09:29.403 --> 09:31.603
The same stuff you found
in port credit.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.138
- Yeah. Now we know
how the pandilla quince

09:34.174 --> 09:35.674
Were bringing the suitcases in.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.342
- Yeah.
- So this is good, right?

09:37.344 --> 09:39.277
We helped your case?
- Well, it would've been better

09:39.412 --> 09:41.479
If you called before
you sequestered the luggage.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.815
- A drug bust pretty much
ensures the pandilla quince

09:43.950 --> 09:45.316
Won't use this route again.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.684
- Yeah, and now,
we'll never know

09:46.720 --> 09:48.119
Who was supposed to pick up
the suitcases. So...

09:48.254 --> 09:49.554
(chuckling)
- way to make your mark,

09:49.689 --> 09:51.056
Chatty-p.
- It's not my fault!

09:51.191 --> 09:52.624
This dog has a yen for coke.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.359
- Why were you looking
for marijuana?

09:54.428 --> 09:56.494
- Yeah. You guys know
it's legal now, right?

09:56.530 --> 09:58.496
- It might be legal here,

09:58.498 --> 10:00.031
But it's still illegal
to export it.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.967
- Yeah.
- We got a tip about a ring

10:02.102 --> 10:05.837
Of rogue bus drivers picking up
green from grow-ops in barrie.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.105
- And get this. Every delivery

10:08.141 --> 10:10.041
Has coincided
with a phish concert.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.810
I figured that part out.
- People still listen to phish?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.080
- What's phish?
- It's a white people thing.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.283
- Oh.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.651
- It's an odd coincidence.
We needed to find more on will,

10:20.687 --> 10:22.587
We find those suitcases.
I think it's a sign.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.656
- A pretty clear sign, actually.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.124
- Hold up. What are you guys
talking about?

10:26.259 --> 10:28.726
- Uh, you know, when you ask
for a sign from the universe,

10:28.762 --> 10:31.595
And it occasionally speaks back?
- Okay, home sense.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.131
"dream big, dream often."

10:33.200 --> 10:34.532
"mommy needs wine to focus."

10:34.534 --> 10:36.401
"it's better at the beach..."
- no.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.003
It's the sign
we were looking for.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.007
- Right. Because we just
busted will's route,

10:42.142 --> 10:43.340
He'll be looking
for another one.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.376
- I think it may be time
for dr. Griffin

10:45.445 --> 10:49.214
To introduce will to my old
friend scarborough stu.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.150
(sighing)
- yo! Scarborough stu!

10:52.152 --> 10:54.052
I missed that guy! Right?

10:54.054 --> 10:55.420
He's got a fleet of trucks

10:55.422 --> 10:57.288
Ready to drive across
a border, see?

10:57.290 --> 10:58.690
- And lots of room
for added inventory.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.425
But maybe just a little bit
less of that accent.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.627
- What's wrong with the accent?

11:02.629 --> 11:04.696
Well, that's...
That's rude, fam.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.898
It's real rude, fam. Not cool.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.233
(footsteps approaching)
- hi.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.503
- Hey, how's the work?

11:12.539 --> 11:14.739
You selling lots of coffee?

11:15.975 --> 11:18.509
- I dropped a suitcase off
like I was supposed to.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.446
But when I went to the bus
station to do another pick-up,

11:21.448 --> 11:25.116
The cops were there.
So now, the route is busted.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.418
- So, you dodged a bullet.
- Now, they wanna break down

11:27.487 --> 11:29.921
All the coke. Like, tonight.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.258
So, tobin asked me to...

11:33.393 --> 11:35.059
Find some people to help.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.462
- Don't look at me!
- Jackie, please.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.063
I need you.
- No!

11:39.132 --> 11:40.598
- Have you had any luck
finding a job?

11:40.667 --> 11:43.134
- No! But I'm still looking.
- Well, then, see?

11:43.170 --> 11:45.102
Make some fast cash
in the meantime.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.772
(suspenseful music)

11:50.210 --> 11:51.876
- I can't.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.047
- Fine.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.782
I'll find some other guys.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.284
- Oh, yeah, where? Who?
Who are you gonna find?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.286
- I grew up in marshall court.
Remember?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.955
So, don't worry about it.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.027
- Hey, shanika.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.529
Be careful. Okay?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.967
(indistinct chatter)

12:17.003 --> 12:19.170
- Thank you.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.938
<i> Salud,</i> gentlemen.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.576
Oh, that's good.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.378
- Yeah, that's tasty, fam.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.447
- Yeah, fam, it is... Tasty.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.717
So, stu,

12:32.719 --> 12:35.720
I'm guessing that you're
looking to purchase a new home.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.755
- Nah, man,
I don't want a house.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.659
- Why else would you reach out
to a real estate agent?

12:41.695 --> 12:43.728
- I need to expand my business.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.064
<i> I got this ex.</i>
<i> She cleaned me out.</i>

12:46.199 --> 12:48.233
<i> Don't get married.</i>
<i> Because then, you know,</i>

12:48.368 --> 12:52.203
<i> You gotta get divorced.</i>
<i> And divorce, it sucks.</i>

12:52.239 --> 12:53.437
<i> (will): Yeah, you telling me.</i>

12:54.474 --> 12:57.675
So, stu, if you don't
mind me asking...

12:58.745 --> 13:00.211
What kind of business
are you in?

13:00.247 --> 13:01.946
- Import-export.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.349
Various products. I like
to diversify as much as I can.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.686
- He's a good guy.
You're a good guy.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.688
Hustlers, the both of you.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.924
Figured you should meet.
- Okay.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.494
Okay, I hear you.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.097
So you're looking
for warehouse space?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.399
- That's what I'm talking about.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.933
For my trucks.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.840
- Alright.
Let's take a look at the mls,

13:28.909 --> 13:30.641
See if we can find
what you're looking for.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.716
<i> How's business anyway?</i>
<i> - It's dead...</i>

13:38.752 --> 13:40.451
- Let me ask you a question.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.721
Do you really believe in signs?

13:43.723 --> 13:46.790
Synchronicity, coincidence,

13:46.827 --> 13:49.526
Epiphanies...
And all that kind of stuff?

13:49.563 --> 13:51.062
- Yeah.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.065
No. I mean, I don't know.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.735
I mean... I'm not above taking
advice from my horoscope.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.737
- Really?
- Yeah, like if I'm having

13:59.773 --> 14:01.405
A difficult time
making a decision,

14:01.441 --> 14:03.341
I'll just invite
input from the universe.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.076
Sometimes, you just need a sign,
you know?

14:05.211 --> 14:06.678
Like a road sign,
or a neon sign,

14:06.813 --> 14:08.913
Or a smack-you-in-the-face
undeniable sign.

14:08.949 --> 14:09.848
- Sam.
- Yes?

14:09.983 --> 14:10.748
- Sam.
- Yes?

14:10.817 --> 14:12.417
- What are they doing?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.619
(giggling)
- oh. They must be armenian.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.553
It's a twist on
an old wedding tradition,

14:16.590 --> 14:17.822
The groom's family
buys the dress

14:17.891 --> 14:19.824
And they walk it over
on the big day.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.592
My college roommate married
an armenian.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.360
And on her wedding day,

14:23.396 --> 14:24.929
They walked the dress over
to the apartment,

14:25.065 --> 14:26.363
And guess what happened.
Guess what happened.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.899
- What?
- A bird shat on it.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.367
- Oh, that is a good sign.
(laughing)

14:29.502 --> 14:31.970
Well, not really because
they divorced four years later.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.906
So... The poop was bad.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.044
(rhythmic music playing)

14:44.717 --> 14:46.584
- Don't buy that boat.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.822
- Why not?

14:50.824 --> 14:53.123
- I mean, you do
whatever you want, but...

14:53.159 --> 14:55.660
Just so you know,
you buy that boat,

14:55.729 --> 14:57.061
You gotta register it.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.130
Now, you're on
harbour police's radar.

15:02.669 --> 15:06.470
You want a boat, I got access
to a pretty sweet one.

15:08.475 --> 15:12.276
I could let you use my services,
for a reasonable price.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.413
I mean, I got cargo coming
back and forth all the time

15:15.482 --> 15:18.849
And I got somebody who looks
the other way when I come in.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.887
I'll tell you what.
I'll take you on the boat.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.889
I'll take you on the boat,
you check it out,

15:25.024 --> 15:26.224
You see for yourself.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.225
- Interesting.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.561
How's Saturday?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.297
- Saturday's perfect.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.769
(sighing)

15:37.904 --> 15:39.704
- I guess we've gotta find
a boat by tomorrow.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.639
- And teach naz how to drive it.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.182
Z to offer trucks?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.984
- Uh, he had to improvise

15:52.986 --> 15:54.318
And he dangled
a different carrot.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.987
- And by carrot,
she means a boat.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.889
- Do you have any idea
where we could get one?

15:57.891 --> 15:59.524
- Actually, yes.
What are we thinking?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.325
Dinghy? Pontoon? Catamaran?

16:01.328 --> 16:02.459
I'm an experienced yachtsman.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.328
I spent every summer
out on the island,

16:04.397 --> 16:06.130
Down at the old rcyc.
- Oh, my god!

16:06.166 --> 16:07.799
Really? Experienced
seawoman, right here.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.267
My uncle travis,
he was a keen mariner,

16:09.402 --> 16:10.668
He taught me
everything that I...

16:11.638 --> 16:13.204
A motorized yacht, ideally.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.072
- I love this.
I'm gonna make some calls,

16:15.141 --> 16:16.273
Find a willing vessel.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.076
Ah, is naz an able seaman?

16:18.078 --> 16:20.411
- It's funny, I was wondering
the same thing too.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.279
How is naz as a seaman?

16:22.281 --> 16:24.281
Don't know if you've become
familiar with his seaman side,

16:24.317 --> 16:26.017
Have you?
- I've not met the seaman

16:26.086 --> 16:28.019
In him yet, but I do
plan on showing him the ropes.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.454
- Hey, if you're busy, I'm happy
to throw my hat in the ring,

16:30.523 --> 16:32.023
Take him out,
give him a few pointers.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.825
- Oh, no. That's okay,
sir, I can handle it.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.127
- I really don't mind.
- I'm sure you have much more

16:36.196 --> 16:37.495
Important things to do, sir.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.896
- It's true, I do.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.965
Okay, well...

16:41.100 --> 16:43.367
Fair winds.
- Following seas.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.803
Yes!

16:45.805 --> 16:47.972
(belching)
oh, gosh. Are you okay?

16:47.974 --> 16:50.041
- I just almost
threw up in my mouth.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.509
All that
intergenerational wealth

16:51.578 --> 16:53.111
Makes me a little nauseous.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.045
- Okay.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.580
(rap music)

17:00.620 --> 17:02.453
(indistinct chattering)

17:04.457 --> 17:06.590
- That's what I like to see.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.393
Your mom would be so proud.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.399
- Yo!

17:15.869 --> 17:17.068
You don't like my art?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.004
- Wouldn't exactly call it art.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.339
(laughing)

17:22.341 --> 17:24.241
- I'm just kidding.
This is not mine.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.677
So, you work with these cops?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.412
- Uh...

17:28.481 --> 17:29.947
Sort of.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.782
Trust me, I'm not a cop though.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.618
- Right.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.423
Mine's over here.
I could show you.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.365
I, uh... Ran out of red paint.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.034
I'm supposed to picking up
more paint on payday.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.770
I babysit a few kids in the area
a few times a week.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.506
I tell you, man,
I earn every penny.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.008
(chuckling)
- it's really cool.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.910
It's good stuff.
- Thanks, man.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.113
So, are you gonna
wash this off too?

18:02.182 --> 18:03.780
- No.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.382
No, I'd rather
help you finish it.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.185
(man): Hey, shanika!
What's popping?

18:08.221 --> 18:10.454
- Come on, guys.
I got a gig, listen up.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.722
I need your help.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.559
It's easy money, the guys
will tell you what to do.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.862
And if you work tonight,
you can probably make like,

18:17.997 --> 18:19.664
Five bills each.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.932
- For real?
- Yo, hey.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.801
No, we can't do that here.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.336
- Five bills in a night,
yeah, I'm gonna do it.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.939
- Bro, no. You haven't
been to prison. I have.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.175
And if I couldn't handle it,
you certainly can't.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.444
Shanika, are you dumb?

18:33.513 --> 18:35.479
Don't bring trouble around here,
we got enough going on.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.615
- But, it's only...
- No!

18:37.617 --> 18:39.683
Why are you always thinking
about a quick bag?

18:39.719 --> 18:43.687
Can we just chill out?
And... Make some art?

18:44.757 --> 18:46.089
Come on.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.759
(indistinct chattering)

18:51.064 --> 18:53.231
(elliot clears throat)

18:53.366 --> 18:55.299
- Is jackie gonna be there?

18:55.335 --> 18:57.834
- If I say yes,
will you come with me?

18:57.871 --> 18:59.770
- No.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.107
(sighing)

19:03.109 --> 19:05.275
(rap music)

19:14.120 --> 19:15.953
(sighing)

19:18.724 --> 19:19.857
- What?

19:21.528 --> 19:24.528
- You've just been silent
this whole time.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.330
- Oh...

19:26.399 --> 19:28.532
- Seems like something's
on your mind.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.268
- Mmm.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.537
- You okay?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.007
- Sure, yeah.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.874
You okay?

19:37.911 --> 19:39.743
- Yeah, I have no complaints.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.146
Stop dodging bullets.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.481
What's up?

19:45.285 --> 19:48.018
- Oh... Just thinking.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.956
Okay, here's a question. Um...

19:51.958 --> 19:54.225
Are you happy, happy?

19:55.662 --> 19:57.762
- Well, happiness
ebbs and flows.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.264
- You're good?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.667
- Yeah. Sure.

20:05.471 --> 20:06.803
- Okay...

20:08.975 --> 20:11.108
- That's what
you wanted to know?

20:11.177 --> 20:13.043
- Uh...
(sighing)

20:13.079 --> 20:14.845
Okay, let me ask you this.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.714
Uh, how do you know

20:16.783 --> 20:19.250
When you're making
the right choice?

20:20.653 --> 20:23.453
- You don't always,
not at first.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.657
First night after
I bought my house,

20:26.726 --> 20:29.594
I nearly threw up
with buyer's remorse.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.463
Turns out the bad feeling

20:32.598 --> 20:34.732
Didn't mean
it was a bad decision.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.468
Sometimes, pulling the trigger
is the hard part.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.270
You in or you out?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.606
Either way, making a choice

20:42.609 --> 20:44.942
Is better than sitting around
debating it.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.678
- Ds greene.
Such a pleasure!

20:47.747 --> 20:49.379
- Officer park.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.417
Thank you, my friend.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.524
- This boat was confiscated
a couple months ago,

21:00.660 --> 21:02.826
I think it's going to meet
your needs perfectly.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.495
- Oh yeah.

21:04.564 --> 21:07.164
So, how'd the owner lose it?
Fishing without a license?

21:07.233 --> 21:09.567
- No. Public indecency.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.635
He was filming orgies
on the lake.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.305
- Oh...

21:14.307 --> 21:16.239
(phone vibrating)

21:19.312 --> 21:21.645
<i> (len): Hey, babe.</i>
<i> I was just thinking about you.</i>

21:21.714 --> 21:25.649
- Oh, funny, 'cause I was...
Thinking about you.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.885
<i> - All good things, I hope.</i>

21:29.989 --> 21:32.656
- Mostly, yeah.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.258
<i>- I was thinking I could pick up</i>
<i> some sushi for dinner,</i>

21:35.295 --> 21:36.860
<i>Maybe from that place on fourth.</i>

21:36.896 --> 21:38.462
<i> We can continue</i>
<i> our conversation.</i>

21:38.531 --> 21:41.665
- Uh, you know,
I'm working late.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.467
But I'll call you as soon
as I'm off.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.669
<i> - Okay. Love you.</i>

21:45.738 --> 21:47.704
- I, uh...

21:48.508 --> 21:51.275
Love you too.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.477
<i> - Bye.</i>
- Bye.

22:03.289 --> 22:05.356
On the boat.
- You text will?

22:05.425 --> 22:07.224
- Yeah, told him to meet me
at bride's waves,

22:07.293 --> 22:08.559
Slot 81, tomorrow midday.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.161
- We're putting cameras
on the deck,

22:10.296 --> 22:11.495
One in the cabin
just to be safe.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.630
- Cool.
- Okay, landlubbers,

22:13.632 --> 22:16.299
We got 18 hours to turn this
first mate into a captain!

22:16.336 --> 22:18.302
- Aye-aye, matey!
- That's good.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.105
- Look, at skipper
and her deck hand.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.974
Good luck, keep us posted.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.243
- Thank you, sir. Let's go.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.279
- Hey, greene.
- Yeah.

22:28.281 --> 22:29.980
- Just wanted to say thanks.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.183
Gabrielle told me
you found her earring.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.385
Paid a pretty penny
for those puppies, so...

22:34.387 --> 22:36.186
I would have been sad
if she lost one.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.723
You're a good catch, man.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.058
Can't blame her
for moving on from me.

22:49.335 --> 22:52.335
- Here it is.
- Oh, okay.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.473
Gotta say, it was a little
bigger than I was expecting.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.742
- It's gonna be fine.
A boat like this is kinda
like a plane.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.878
The only tricky part is
the take-off and the landing,

23:00.947 --> 23:02.546
But you know,
once you're out there,

23:02.548 --> 23:03.881
Instinct's just gonna take over.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.382
Come on, I'll show ya.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.787
Okay, so just remember,
when you're leaving the dock,

23:09.789 --> 23:11.155
You don't need to touch
the steering wheel.

23:11.224 --> 23:12.689
- I just use
my transmission, right?

23:12.725 --> 23:14.624
- Yeah, that's right.
So, there's three engines,

23:14.660 --> 23:17.294
Each with its own
transmission and throttle,
and they're right here,

23:17.363 --> 23:19.763
So it's forward, it's neutral,
and it's reverse.

23:19.832 --> 23:25.302
- Okay, so forward, neutral,
and then reverse?

23:25.304 --> 23:27.705
- Yep, that's....

23:27.840 --> 23:29.907
- Good.
- Really good.

23:30.042 --> 23:33.110
Um, okay,
these are your blowers.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.344
- That's my blower?

23:36.315 --> 23:38.182
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.651
Just making sure.
- Yeah, and just remember
that you have to, um...

23:40.720 --> 23:42.720
Turn those on before
you turn on the engine.

23:42.855 --> 23:46.056
- How come?
- To exhaust the fumes.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.392
- Yeah. Gotta exhaust the fumes.
- Yeah.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.596
Behind me is the bow-thruster.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.031
- A what, sorry?
- You heard me.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.667
Oh, wait. What about the cameras
that kelly planted?

23:56.802 --> 23:58.168
- I already unplugged them.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.037
- Woo!

24:03.075 --> 24:05.709
<i> ♪ hot child in the city ♪</i>

24:07.413 --> 24:09.880
<i> ♪ running wild</i>
<i> and looking pretty ♪</i>

24:09.916 --> 24:11.414
- Hey, tobin.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.151
- I thought you were
bringing friends?

24:15.288 --> 24:17.621
- I didn't find anyone.
Everyone was busy.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.323
- You said it wasn't
going to be a problem.

24:19.392 --> 24:21.091
- I didn't think
it would be, but--

24:21.227 --> 24:24.094
- But I don't like it when
people overpromise, shan.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.363
- I'll find people.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.598
I just need another day.

24:29.335 --> 24:30.868
I'm sorry.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.169
Really.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.638
- It's all good.

24:35.574 --> 24:36.774
As long as you're sorry.

24:38.444 --> 24:40.377
(rhythmic music)

24:51.924 --> 24:55.025
(laughing)
- wow, that was, uh...

24:55.061 --> 24:57.528
You were, that was really,
yes, nice.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.195
- It was really nice, wasn't it?

24:59.232 --> 25:01.665
Yeah! Surprisingly,
pretty smooth too.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.601
- It was pretty good.
I mean, except when you got

25:03.603 --> 25:05.269
Your foot stuck
in that seat cushion thing...

25:05.338 --> 25:07.438
- I mean, I feel like that
was just for a second,

25:07.440 --> 25:08.873
Not really worth mentioning.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.075
I don't think it goes into
the whole story, you know?

25:11.210 --> 25:13.610
- Hey, do you think the fact

25:13.746 --> 25:17.214
That it took us so long
to get here means something?

25:17.349 --> 25:20.617
- I think it means that maybe
it was worth the wait.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.354
I don't know, sam, I mean,
it's different, right?

25:24.423 --> 25:26.923
Like, dating at our age,

25:28.094 --> 25:30.094
You don't have to be
in such a rush about it all.

25:30.096 --> 25:32.296
- It's true. But you know what,
if you did want to rush

25:32.298 --> 25:33.697
To do it again,
I wouldn't say no.

25:33.832 --> 25:34.965
- Okay, yeah. Up here?

25:35.100 --> 25:36.366
What do you think?
- Hey, stu!

25:36.435 --> 25:37.601
(gasping)
- oh, my god, get down.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.036
- You there? It's will.
- I'm going.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.037
- Go, go, go!

25:40.106 --> 25:41.772
Hey, man!

25:42.642 --> 25:44.641
Why are you a day early, bro?

25:45.578 --> 25:47.511
- Why aren't you wearing pants?

25:47.646 --> 25:49.980
- Oh nah, I was taking a bit
of a disco nap, you know?

25:50.016 --> 25:51.782
Kinda won't get creased.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.917
- Alright. Hey, look.
Something came up for tomorrow,

25:53.953 --> 25:55.719
We need to talk about this now.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.722
- Yeah. Cool.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.133
(indistinct chattering)

26:11.404 --> 26:15.005
- Hey. How was nerd squad?

26:15.074 --> 26:18.508
- Like summer camp meets
community service.

26:19.845 --> 26:22.212
(sighing)
- for the record...

26:22.214 --> 26:25.482
I think you're more than ready
to get back to work.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.753
- Thanks for not treating me
like a baby.

26:31.157 --> 26:34.424
And... For everything else.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.027
Pepy aside, I'm really glad
to be back.

26:37.063 --> 26:40.730
My health, work, nathan...

26:41.834 --> 26:45.502
I just feel really lucky,
I guess.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.206
- Yes, you are.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.008
- Anyway, have a good night.
- Yeah, bye.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.582
(sighing)

27:03.189 --> 27:07.924
Um... Hey, len, it's me.
Just finishing up work.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.794
I was thinking maybe that
we could meet back at my place

27:10.796 --> 27:12.463
In about an hour or so.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.132
Um... We need to talk.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.533
Okay.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.141
(sighing)

27:24.276 --> 27:27.745
- So, how often do you get it
out on the water?

27:27.747 --> 27:30.881
- Oh, a couple times a week.
You know, for business.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.017
(will): Not for personal use?

27:33.152 --> 27:36.153
See, I did some digging
on the bride's wave, and...

27:36.288 --> 27:39.689
Seems like some good times
were had on this boat.

27:39.725 --> 27:41.357
- You're talking
about the orgy stuff.

27:41.394 --> 27:43.426
(laughing)

27:43.462 --> 27:45.495
Listen, I hosed the whole thing
down. Trust me, okay?

27:45.564 --> 27:49.232
I still would not to take
a blacklight to some of these
couches though, okay?

27:49.268 --> 27:52.235
(laughing)
- no, it's just, my point is

27:52.271 --> 27:55.539
This boat that
you have access to,

27:55.608 --> 27:58.442
It's supposedly discreet,
off the radar,

27:58.444 --> 28:02.246
This boat was confiscated by
the police a few months ago...

28:02.381 --> 28:03.847
- Where's my phone?

28:03.982 --> 28:05.849
(will): That got me wondering...
- Where's my phone?

28:05.851 --> 28:07.451
Where's my phone?

28:07.453 --> 28:10.053
- Why would you use a boat
that was confiscated

28:10.122 --> 28:12.055
By the cops?

28:12.091 --> 28:14.524
(suspenseful music)

28:15.094 --> 28:16.526
Are you a cop?

28:18.798 --> 28:21.865
(laughing): You gotta be
kidding me with that.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.268
Am I a cop?
Of course I'm not a cop.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.270
That doesn't mean
I don't know cops.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.473
I got a friend at impound.

28:29.542 --> 28:32.942
- A cop friend?
- A friend friend.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.412
I told you, I got people who
bend the rules for me,

28:35.547 --> 28:39.015
That's how I get stuff in.
It's how I get things done.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.485
But if you don't trust me,

28:41.487 --> 28:44.187
Maybe you should just get
the hell off of my wave.

28:47.292 --> 28:48.959
(chuckling)

28:49.028 --> 28:51.895
- I have to do my due diligence,
it's just the thing is,

28:51.931 --> 28:53.697
Not many of my friends
have heard of you.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.766
(naz): Good! What are you
talking about here?

28:55.901 --> 28:58.735
It's a popularity contest?
Or is this a business deal?

28:58.870 --> 29:03.107
- Hey! Will told me
he was getting a new boat,

29:03.242 --> 29:05.576
I hope I'm not too late
to christen it.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.644
(will): It's not a party,
it's a business meeting.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.779
(adeline): Either way,
I'm not a dog.

29:09.815 --> 29:11.881
You just left me in the car
like a dog.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.387
- This is your wife?

29:18.491 --> 29:21.325
- I'm his sister. Adeline.

29:21.327 --> 29:25.362
He broke up with trina,
which is why he's not wearing
any socks, it's...

29:25.431 --> 29:27.865
So weird he doesn't own his own.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.200
You own your own socks, right?

29:30.202 --> 29:32.102
- Yeah, I do.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.871
(gasping)
- like a grown up man.

29:36.142 --> 29:39.142
I just had deja...
Major deja vu.

29:41.413 --> 29:44.214
I've been on this boat.
Yeah, will!

29:44.250 --> 29:46.683
I did kiki on this boat.

29:46.719 --> 29:50.954
Well, kiki, and margot, and
larry, and george, and...

29:51.023 --> 29:52.455
- Okay, enough.

29:52.525 --> 29:54.557
- So, do you want to party,
or what?

29:55.427 --> 29:57.261
- No.
(laughing): Okay.

29:58.397 --> 30:01.031
You do your thing,
don't mind me.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.367
Do you have one already open?

30:04.403 --> 30:05.902
Oh, no, I don't like that one.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.570
(adeline laughing)

30:08.808 --> 30:10.440
<i> (officer): Harbour police,</i>
<i> what's your emergency?</i>

30:11.143 --> 30:12.309
- What was that?

30:15.314 --> 30:16.713
- That's a scanner.

30:16.749 --> 30:18.515
I keep it on the police channel.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.584
Make sure nothing's incoming.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.685
(indistinct chattering)

30:22.721 --> 30:25.856
(will): I'd say he's smart.
The man thinks ahead,
I like that.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.060
(naz): If you stay ready,
you don't have to get ready!

30:30.195 --> 30:32.729
(will): I hear that, brother.
Your father sounds like
a wise man.

30:32.798 --> 30:33.931
- Yes.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.932
(indistinct chatter)

30:38.204 --> 30:41.672
- Hey. Hello to you too.
Where have you been?

30:45.878 --> 30:47.810
Okay, what's up, bro?

30:50.616 --> 30:51.748
(gasping)

30:55.153 --> 30:57.888
Shanika, shanika!

30:58.023 --> 31:01.024
What... Happened?!

31:01.060 --> 31:04.494
- I had to tell tobin
I couldn't find anyone.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.630
- So what, he jumped you?
Did he jump you? That--

31:06.765 --> 31:10.199
- He had some girls do it.
Teach me a lesson.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.037
A coyote never breaks
their word.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.973
(sighing)
- sweetie...

31:17.109 --> 31:20.043
Sweetie, honey, sweetie,

31:20.045 --> 31:23.179
You have got to stay away
from this stuff.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.048
- No, you need to help me.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.317
They're not gonna
let me out that easy.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.687
I need you to do this
for me, okay?

31:32.591 --> 31:33.823
(scoffing)

31:47.873 --> 31:49.673
- Oh, there you are!

31:49.675 --> 31:51.942
Oh, you look great!

31:52.077 --> 31:54.678
I mean, not that you don't
usually look good, you do.

31:54.813 --> 31:57.414
Uh, I'm sorry, is this
sexual harassment?

31:57.549 --> 31:59.549
- What do you want, breann?
- Okay, um,

31:59.551 --> 32:02.152
This is gonna sound weird,
but we got a message for you

32:02.154 --> 32:04.888
From the harbour police
on the radio, and get this,

32:05.023 --> 32:07.657
It's in morse code.
- What?

32:09.428 --> 32:12.996
"so, will you be
my bride? Wait."

32:14.433 --> 32:17.167
Is this a joke?
Did len put you up to this?

32:17.236 --> 32:20.837
- Len who? Um, no.

32:20.906 --> 32:23.640
I tried to decipher it
myself, but, um...

32:23.775 --> 32:25.809
Oh, wait, hang on a second.

32:25.878 --> 32:29.645
I... I got a couple letters
wrong. Okay, this is this,

32:29.682 --> 32:31.648
And this is this... Hmm...

32:31.783 --> 32:33.816
It actually says, um...

32:33.852 --> 32:37.721
"sos, will is on
the bride's wave."

32:38.924 --> 32:42.259
- Sam, geez. Good work, breann.
- Oh, thank you.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.060
Also, I just want to say
I'm really sorry

32:44.196 --> 32:45.996
About the suitcase thing
earlier. Hmm...

32:51.904 --> 32:55.305
Do you mind if I go inside?
Memories, you know?

32:55.307 --> 32:57.174
- You know what,
I'd rather you didn't.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.875
It's a big old mess down there.

32:58.911 --> 33:01.912
- I just want to see if it
still has the padded ceilings.

33:02.047 --> 33:04.247
(will): Yeah, like you could
remember that.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.483
- It's the kind of thing you
don't forget.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.885
You wouldn't know,
'cause you're never invited.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.586
- Like I would want
to be invited!

33:10.622 --> 33:11.954
(laughing)

33:11.991 --> 33:14.491
- Okay, guys, let's just
chill out for a second.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.427
How about... How about
some more champagne, huh?
Let's have a toast.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.430
I'm stu, by the way, we didn't
officially meet.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.766
- Do people ever
call you "stert"?

33:22.835 --> 33:26.436
'cause I would.
That one's my favourite.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.639
- They're all your favourite.
- Shut up, debbie...

33:29.641 --> 33:31.308
...Downer.

33:31.843 --> 33:32.976
(sighing)

33:33.111 --> 33:34.977
(will): Yeah, I think
you've had enough.

33:35.014 --> 33:38.782
(adeline): You're wrong. So,
tell me about yourself, stert.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.616
What kind of business
are you in?

33:41.854 --> 33:44.120
- Import-export.
- Mmm...

33:45.124 --> 33:47.323
That code for a drug dealer?
- Adeline!

33:47.359 --> 33:49.659
- What?
- No, I bring stuff

33:49.728 --> 33:53.396
Across the border in trucks,
and cars, and boats.

33:53.399 --> 33:56.600
- So yes, then.
That's very sexual.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.001
It's dangerous.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.471
Are you a tough guy?
- Am I a tough guy?

34:01.540 --> 34:03.740
Sure, I'm a tough guy.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.410
- You know, my mom used to say

34:06.545 --> 34:09.346
About guys who said
that they were tough,

34:09.481 --> 34:11.815
"barking dogs seldom bite."

34:12.951 --> 34:14.417
That's what she said.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.153
- And you remember
the security of war slogan?

34:17.222 --> 34:18.755
"loose lips..."

34:20.259 --> 34:21.724
"...Sink ships."

34:22.895 --> 34:25.028
Just don't say anything
in front of this one.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.563
- You just think I'm gonna
blab everything.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.831
- Yeah, because you do, addie.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.234
- Okay, wait, can you give me
those back? They're, like, $700.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.037
- You spent $700 on flip-flops?

34:34.039 --> 34:36.306
- Oh, my god.
You're so uptight!

34:36.441 --> 34:38.508
- I'm uptight? I'm done.

34:38.544 --> 34:40.410
Come on.
- No.

34:41.379 --> 34:43.012
I'm staying with stert.

34:45.584 --> 34:48.385
- Fine, fine,
I will call you a car.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.320
Let's just see
if you can remember

34:50.322 --> 34:51.721
How to get back
to the street.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.189
- Adeline, you--

34:53.258 --> 34:54.691
- And you!
She's your problem now.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.527
(door handle rattling)
(naz): Take it easy, buddy.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.597
Will, wait.
We can work this out, bro.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.399
(will): No, you guys have fun...
- Oh, yeah.

35:04.803 --> 35:07.203
I remember this place.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.273
(will): Trust me, the last thing
she needs is another drink.

35:10.408 --> 35:11.541
- Hey, can I use your bathroom?

35:11.577 --> 35:12.975
(door handle rattling)

35:13.912 --> 35:16.079
- Okay? Because I am done.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.414
- What the hell is all this?
Who are you?

35:20.452 --> 35:25.154
Stu, who the hell is this guy?
What did we say about...?

35:26.358 --> 35:29.959
Oh wow, so now you got
two strangers in here, huh?

35:30.028 --> 35:31.494
- Good evening, officer.

35:33.098 --> 35:35.699
You're gorgeous.
- I'm taken.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.434
- How taken?
- Very.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.969
Like, I'm about to go
for sushi with my boyfriend

35:40.005 --> 35:44.174
Who proposed to me this morning.
I'm taken, so back off.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.710
(adeline): Congratulations!
How did he pop the question?

35:47.746 --> 35:49.412
- He put the ring
in the freezer.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.581
Is there anything else
you need to know?

35:51.583 --> 35:52.916
- Everything.
(kelly): Stu!

35:53.051 --> 35:54.917
I need to talk to you
in private, now!

35:54.953 --> 35:56.352
- Yeah.

35:56.354 --> 35:58.454
(intriguing music)

35:59.791 --> 36:02.124
I'll be with you in a sec, will,
give me a second.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.862
- What part of "private"
don't you get?

36:10.169 --> 36:11.734
- What the hell
are you doing here?

36:11.770 --> 36:13.502
- Saving you, just roll with it.

36:14.472 --> 36:15.939
(sighing)

36:16.074 --> 36:20.210
I don't want people seeing me,
that was part of our plan.

36:21.079 --> 36:23.879
That's why I do things for you.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.748
You understand?

36:25.817 --> 36:28.685
So who the hell
are these people?!

36:28.687 --> 36:31.755
- I met them on the island,
they needed a water taxi.

36:31.890 --> 36:35.225
- Oh, you met 'em on the island,
they needed a water taxi!

36:35.227 --> 36:37.427
You running a water taxi
business now?

36:37.429 --> 36:40.263
- Look, they're not even
from here, okay? You're safe!

36:40.398 --> 36:41.664
- I love you.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.434
- Fine. We'll pick
this up tomorrow.

36:45.470 --> 36:47.903
But you are coming to me.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.578
(naz): Well, sorry about that.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.681
Alright, you were early,
she was late.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.384
- Who was that?
- I didn't tell her

37:01.420 --> 37:02.786
Who you were,
so I'm sure as hell

37:02.921 --> 37:04.254
Not gonna tell you
who she is.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.190
Like I said,
I got friends, will.

37:07.192 --> 37:09.125
- Well, then why didn't you
ask her to stay?

37:09.194 --> 37:10.994
We could've had more drinks.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.995
And fyi,

37:13.031 --> 37:17.066
I would never take...
A water taxi!

37:17.102 --> 37:19.068
- Okay! Okay.
(adeline laughing)

37:19.137 --> 37:21.204
Someone's been over-served.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.740
(laughing)
let's get you home.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.941
(grunting)
okay!

37:28.647 --> 37:30.280
I'll call you tomorrow

37:30.282 --> 37:32.114
When train-wreck's
sleeping it off, okay?

37:32.818 --> 37:34.350
You did good.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.454
(suspenseful music)

37:40.158 --> 37:42.124
- Oh, there's a caterpillar!

37:49.434 --> 37:50.767
(sighing)

38:04.616 --> 38:06.382
(kelly sighing)
- hey.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.386
I just... Would like
to thank you again for tonight,

38:10.455 --> 38:11.854
That was amazing.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.724
You kept... Will's
ridiculous sister

38:14.859 --> 38:17.126
From finding me and you
cemented naz's play. It was...

38:18.530 --> 38:19.863
It was truly inspired.

38:20.732 --> 38:24.133
- Well, I'm inspiring.

38:24.169 --> 38:27.603
- Honestly, convincing will
that you're like, a dirty cop,

38:27.673 --> 38:30.273
I mean, telling adeline
that you were engaged

38:30.408 --> 38:32.275
So that she would leave you
alone, I mean, wow.

38:32.344 --> 38:33.943
I thought your best
undercover work

38:34.079 --> 38:36.212
Was always pulled from
the truth, but whew!

38:36.281 --> 38:37.881
You've got quite an imagination.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.417
- Len asked me to marry him.

38:40.552 --> 38:43.419
- That's... Wow.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.323
What...
(clears throat)

38:48.560 --> 38:49.893
What did you say?

38:50.028 --> 38:51.627
- I told him I needed
to think about it.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.696
I mean, it's a big decision,

38:53.765 --> 38:56.165
And I don't know
where to find the answers.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.568
And, you know, I keep seeing
these signs everywhere,

38:58.637 --> 39:01.037
You know, the wedding dresses,
the name on the boat,

39:01.039 --> 39:05.108
It's like the universe is
shoving me towards saying yes.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.877
- I just feel like that's not
a great reason to get married.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.112
- You're the one who told me
the universe gives you signs.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.115
- Yeah, if you're trying
to decide between chocolate
and vanilla cake

39:12.117 --> 39:13.716
For your son's birthday,
not for getting married!

39:13.719 --> 39:15.852
I mean, duff, for that, you need
to make an informed decision.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.987
- How can you make an informed
decision about getting married?

39:17.989 --> 39:19.923
You can't be informed
about the future.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.758
- True, there is an element
of risk, but...

39:21.827 --> 39:23.659
(sighing)

39:23.695 --> 39:26.495
I don't know. Go with your gut.

39:30.902 --> 39:31.901
(scoffing)

39:33.538 --> 39:35.338
Did you want to say yes?

39:36.908 --> 39:40.142
- Yes. I wanted to say yes.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.745
I want the kids,
I want the house.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.614
- Technically, you can have
all those things on your own.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.816
- But I don't want it on my own!
I want a family!

39:46.852 --> 39:48.418
I wanted that with len before,

39:48.420 --> 39:50.620
So I don't see
why I can't have it now.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.022
I mean, yes,
we had our issues in the past,

39:53.091 --> 39:54.824
But they seem to have
sorted themselves out.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.226
What are you doing?

39:56.361 --> 39:59.762
- We are going to figure
this out together.

39:59.831 --> 40:05.034
Okay, so you have a pretty big
reason to say yes. Why say no?

40:05.036 --> 40:06.836
- Pff, lifelong unhappiness.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.571
- That's what divorce is for.
Next.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.506
- Okay, he relapses.
- Likelihood?

40:10.542 --> 40:12.708
- You know, he's pretty solid,
it's been two years,

40:12.778 --> 40:15.377
So actually, don't write that.
- Okay, so what else?

40:15.414 --> 40:17.580
- We stop having fun together?
- Right.

40:17.715 --> 40:21.050
- No, actually, no, stop. That's
never been a problem of ours.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.652
- Okay, what else?
- I don't know.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.154
Well, nathan's off the table,
so you can't say that.

40:25.157 --> 40:28.324
- Okay, so just, what if...
Nathan was on the table?

40:28.460 --> 40:30.994
Would you choose him over len?
- He's not on the table.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.996
- No, I'm just saying that
nathan is a really good guy.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.865
Like, he is so good
he could win awards.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.067
If you think that you two
still have a chance,

40:38.136 --> 40:40.136
Maybe you guys
should just hold off.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.071
- Good night, sam.
- No wait, I was just wondering,

40:42.140 --> 40:44.507
When you were seeing signs,
were any of those signs
pointing towards nathan?

40:44.576 --> 40:45.809
I mean, maybe it wasn't obvious.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.343
Maybe it was like
a real signifier of meaning.

40:47.345 --> 40:48.744
Duff?

40:51.216 --> 40:52.815
(soft music)

40:52.818 --> 40:55.218
(nathan): I'm just saying,
it would've been nice

40:55.220 --> 40:57.887
For me to know.
That's all, that's it.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.756
- I will never
do that again, okay?

41:01.760 --> 41:03.293
I don't want to fight, please.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.793
- I don't want to fight either.

41:05.697 --> 41:08.531

- Hey.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.779
- Hi.
- What if I told you

41:22.781 --> 41:24.447
I wanted to get married
because I saw four drunk girls

41:24.582 --> 41:26.216
Holding up a wedding dress
in the street?

41:26.351 --> 41:28.651
- I would say, that is a sign
you should not get married.

41:28.687 --> 41:30.653
- I completely agree.
- Why, are we...

41:30.722 --> 41:33.122
Are we getting married?
- Oh no, no, god no.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.024
Although, I'd enjoy seeing
your seaman side.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.559
- Not bad, huh?
- Yeah, it was pretty good.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.427
- Thank you so much.
Hey, let me ask you something.

41:38.463 --> 41:40.196
What do you think,
your place of mine, tonight?

41:40.198 --> 41:42.464
- Well, it's just that my place
has a teenage son and a mom.

41:42.501 --> 41:44.333
- Right, well I have
a single bed in mine, so...

41:44.369 --> 41:46.469
- Wow, that's a really good
excuse to get close to you.

41:46.538 --> 41:47.870
- Really?!
- Yeah!

41:47.873 --> 41:49.004
- You don't need an excuse.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.841
(sighing)

41:56.214 --> 41:57.881
(sighing)

41:58.016 --> 41:59.982
(clearing throat)

42:03.888 --> 42:05.688
- What time is it?
- Almost ten.

42:05.823 --> 42:08.791
Sorry I'm late, some work stuff
came up, it was an emergency.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.927
- It's all good.
(sighing)

42:11.062 --> 42:12.428
You're here now.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.100
- God, I could sure use a drink.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.869
Oh, sorry.
You don't mind, do you?

42:21.806 --> 42:25.508
I just figured
we could eat and...

42:25.510 --> 42:27.043
- Kell.

42:27.112 --> 42:29.411
You left me a message hours ago
saying you wanted to talk.

42:29.447 --> 42:31.180
You know damn well
I'm not gonna be able to eat.

42:31.316 --> 42:33.850
My stomach is doing flips.
I had a damn stress nap.

42:33.852 --> 42:35.318
I haven't done that
since college.

42:35.387 --> 42:37.487
- Yes.
- Yes?

42:39.424 --> 42:42.524
- Yes. I'll marry you.

42:42.561 --> 42:45.194
Look, I'm tired of waiting
for my life to happen,

42:45.196 --> 42:49.332
So let's just do the damn thing
and put a ring on it.

42:50.535 --> 42:53.336
(soft music)

42:53.471 --> 42:56.538
You know if this doesn't fit,
I'm gonna read into it, right?

42:57.542 --> 42:59.675
- Oh, don't worry.
So will I.

43:04.749 --> 43:05.914
Wow...
