<i>Air and naval forces</i>

00:12.407 --> 00:14.505
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>

00:14.540 --> 00:15.872
<i>...savage acts of terror in</i>

00:15.906 --> 00:18.509
<i>Africa, Europe,</i>

00:18.543 --> 00:21.348
<i>This will not stand, this</i>
<i>aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:21.383 --> 00:22.915
- <i>- This relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.949 --> 00:24.682
<i>We will make no distinction.</i>

00:24.717 --> 00:26.014
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:26.049 --> 00:27.215
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:27.249 --> 00:29.182
This was an act of terrorism.

00:29.216 --> 00:31.682
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.375
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

00:34.409 --> 00:35.542
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:35.576 --> 00:38.175
...until something stops him.

00:38.209 --> 00:41.008
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:41.042 --> 00:44.576
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:45.942 --> 00:48.242
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:48.275 --> 00:52.733
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:58.576 --> 01:01.042
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

01:01.075 --> 01:02.058
God!

01:02.178 --> 01:03.792
<i>Fuck! I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:04.053 --> 01:06.968
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:09.160 --> 01:10.577
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:10.696 --> 01:12.329
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

01:12.363 --> 01:14.329

01:26.696 --> 01:28.196
How has the homecoming been?

01:28.229 --> 01:29.363
It's been great.

01:29.396 --> 01:31.796
For all of us.

01:31.830 --> 01:35.229
<i>I appreciate you</i>
<i>looking out for Jessica,</i>

01:35.263 --> 01:37.796
like you did while I was gone.

01:37.830 --> 01:38.830
What do you want to know?

01:38.863 --> 01:40.730
How he died.

01:40.763 --> 01:42.897
<i>He's gone.</i>

01:42.930 --> 01:44.329
Does it really matter
how it happened?

01:44.363 --> 01:45.730
It does to me.

01:45.763 --> 01:48.029
We're onto the next case.

01:48.062 --> 01:49.563
Raqim Faisel.

01:49.596 --> 01:51.162
What did you say?

01:51.196 --> 01:53.596
He should use an alternate
route. Tell him now.

01:56.963 --> 01:59.062
<i>See what second team</i>

01:59.096 --> 02:00.162
comes up with tonight.

02:00.196 --> 02:01.263
If nothing, move on.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.162
What?

02:04.196 --> 02:05.663
The one surviving terrorist

02:05.696 --> 02:06.930
<i>from the compound</i>
<i>in Afghanistan</i>

02:06.963 --> 02:08.229
<i>where we rescued Brody.</i>

02:08.263 --> 02:09.530
<i>Scooped him up in</i>

02:09.562 --> 02:10.997
<i>some shit shack in IBD.</i>

02:11.029 --> 02:12.429
<i>Afzal Hamid.</i>

02:12.463 --> 02:13.930
You and Carrie
will interrogate him,

02:13.963 --> 02:15.396
<i>with the help</i>
<i>of Sergeant Brody.</i>

02:15.429 --> 02:16.997
Do you know this man?

02:17.029 --> 02:20.229
He was my guard.

02:20.263 --> 02:21.830
What can I do for you, Sergeant?

02:21.863 --> 02:23.029
I believe I've earned
a moment face-to-face

02:23.062 --> 02:25.096
<i>with my torturer, sir.</i>

02:29.129 --> 02:31.062
14th man gave up
an e-mail address we just traced

02:31.096 --> 02:33.263
to the Engineering Department
at Bryden University.

02:33.296 --> 02:34.963
Professor we tailed then cleared?
Correct.

02:34.997 --> 02:36.129
Find this man.

02:36.162 --> 02:37.463
Raqim Faisel.

02:37.496 --> 02:40.229
What's going on, Saul?

02:40.263 --> 02:43.129
Hamid's dead.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.429
Suicide.

02:44.463 --> 02:46.363
How the hell is that possible?

02:46.396 --> 02:48.029
Razor blade fragment.

02:48.062 --> 02:49.563
Left wrist.

02:49.596 --> 02:51.630
What? Where did he get that?

02:51.663 --> 02:54.897
What the hell?

02:54.930 --> 02:57.196
Not only did Brody contrive
to get himself in the room,

02:57.229 --> 02:59.796
he orchestrated Hamid's suicide
and he warned Dr. Faisel.

02:59.830 --> 03:02.429
And we-- you and I--
let it happen.

03:02.463 --> 03:04.897
I think you should leave now.

03:04.930 --> 03:06.263
With pleasure.

03:06.296 --> 03:07.463
Know what, you can keep that.

03:07.496 --> 03:08.663
Fuck this shit!

How did you think this...

03:27.096 --> 03:28.997
Come on!

03:30.296 --> 03:31.997
Come on!

03:34.196 --> 03:35.229
Come on!

03:49.563 --> 03:50.530
Calm down!

03:50.563 --> 03:53.029
Calm down. Calm down.

03:53.062 --> 03:55.930
How is such a massive
fuck-up even possible?

03:55.963 --> 03:57.930
Please, explain that to me.

03:57.963 --> 03:59.830
Sorry I'm late.

03:59.863 --> 04:01.463
Hamid probably brought
the razor blade with him.

04:01.496 --> 04:03.663
The heel of one of his
shoes was peeled back.

04:03.696 --> 04:04.963
It's also conceivable that
he found the razor blade

04:04.997 --> 04:06.429
somewhere in the safe house.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.963
One of our sweepers
might have missed it.

04:08.997 --> 04:10.897
There is another possibility.

04:12.596 --> 04:15.296
Someone on our side
could have given it to him.

04:15.329 --> 04:16.997
Th-That's a stretch.

04:17.029 --> 04:18.663
Why?

04:18.696 --> 04:20.363
You actually think
someone on the SEAL team

04:20.396 --> 04:21.997
gave Hamid a piece
of broken razor blade?

04:22.029 --> 04:23.730
Or maybe you think
I did it, or Saul.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.129
I certainly don't
think you did it.

04:25.162 --> 04:26.563
I'm just saying, we
should polygraph

04:26.596 --> 04:28.730
everyone who came into
contact with Hamid.

04:28.763 --> 04:31.663
Ask each one of them directly
about the razor blade.

04:31.696 --> 04:33.229
I've written up a list.

04:33.263 --> 04:35.029
We're talking about 11 people,

04:35.062 --> 04:36.963
including the SEAL team
that brought him here.

04:36.997 --> 04:38.963
She's right.

04:38.997 --> 04:40.830
We can't rule out
the possibility

04:40.863 --> 04:42.763
of a mole.

04:42.796 --> 04:45.763
What if Raqim Faisel
was warned by the same person

04:45.796 --> 04:46.930
who gave Hamid the razor blade?

04:46.963 --> 04:48.329
Faisel?

04:48.363 --> 04:50.363
The guy that bought the house
by the airport?

04:50.396 --> 04:51.997
You want to connect him to this?

04:52.029 --> 04:54.596
He disappeared
just as we moved in.

04:54.630 --> 04:55.863
Coincidence?

04:55.897 --> 04:57.863
Or did he know we were coming?

04:57.897 --> 05:01.329
Oh, good Christ.

05:01.363 --> 05:04.329
Look, if nothing more,
let's cover our asses.

05:04.363 --> 05:06.696
11 polygraph tests.
What's the big deal?

05:06.730 --> 05:08.863
I'll go first.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.897
Take care of the polygraphs.

05:22.029 --> 05:23.630
Don't you ever do
that to me again!

05:23.663 --> 05:26.730
You disagree with me, fine,
but make it a sidebar!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.563
Well, you heard
what the man said.

05:31.596 --> 05:32.663
Set up the polygraphs!

05:32.696 --> 05:34.396
And get me Faisel!

05:34.429 --> 05:36.429
Yes, sir.

05:43.997 --> 05:46.029
What a surprise.
Sergeant Brody's on this list.

05:46.062 --> 05:47.229
Well, it's not my fault

05:47.263 --> 05:48.830
Estes let him in
the room with Hamid.

05:48.863 --> 05:49.963
Expected to find
your resignation

05:49.997 --> 05:51.496
on my desk this morning.

05:51.530 --> 05:53.062
I had a much better
idea, don't you think?

05:53.096 --> 05:54.263
I should forget
the things you said?

05:54.296 --> 05:55.563
Yes, please.

05:57.429 --> 05:59.096
He's right, you know.

05:59.129 --> 06:00.463
You embarrassed him in there.

06:00.496 --> 06:01.997
Who gives a shit?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.329
Saul, we're gonna get Brody.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.830
He'll never pass
the polygraph test.

06:06.863 --> 06:08.229
We'll see.

06:08.263 --> 06:09.930
I'll bet you
everything I've got.

06:09.963 --> 06:12.096
Everything. Including
my <i>Monk's Dream,</i>

06:12.129 --> 06:14.263
signed by Thelonious himself.

06:14.296 --> 06:15.730
I prefer Coltrane.

06:15.763 --> 06:18.496
Not so fussy.

06:31.763 --> 06:34.229
Okay, uh, here.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.263
So, uh, the tables
will go right here,

06:36.296 --> 06:37.496
the chairs around the tables,

06:37.530 --> 06:39.563
and then just
throughout the yard, okay?

06:39.596 --> 06:41.329
All right.

06:43.396 --> 06:45.530
Yeah, okay.

06:47.263 --> 06:48.630
Damn it you two.

06:48.663 --> 06:50.563
The memorial
is in a half an hour.

06:50.596 --> 06:53.263
You're supposed to be ready.
Get dressed.

06:53.296 --> 06:55.530
Ma, this little creep
keeps hogging the bathroom!

06:55.563 --> 06:56.630
Chris, let your sister

06:56.663 --> 06:57.897
use the bathroom, please!

06:59.530 --> 07:01.029
You okay?

07:01.062 --> 07:05.296
Not exactly looking forward
to seeing Helen Walker.

07:05.329 --> 07:08.329
Kind of got on my high horse
when she remarried.

07:08.363 --> 07:10.196
Why?

07:10.229 --> 07:12.196
I was waiting for you
to come home.

07:12.229 --> 07:14.830
I guess I figured
she could do the same.

07:14.863 --> 07:16.463
I had no right.

07:18.496 --> 07:20.930
Do you know
what you're going to say?

07:20.963 --> 07:22.096
At the service?

07:24.029 --> 07:25.830
No.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.463
Well, just be honest.

07:27.496 --> 07:30.396
I'm sure everything's
gonna be fine.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.830
We should hurry.

07:45.496 --> 07:47.463
Here.

08:04.596 --> 08:06.162
You look very handsome,

08:06.196 --> 08:08.196
Sergeant Brody.

08:27.396 --> 08:29.329
Is your name
Carrie Mathison?

08:29.363 --> 08:30.696
Last time I checked.

08:30.730 --> 08:32.029
Yes or no, please.

08:32.062 --> 08:33.763
Yes.

08:33.796 --> 08:35.596
Do you work for
the Central Intelligence Agency?

08:35.630 --> 08:37.062
Yes.

08:37.096 --> 08:39.563
Regarding the questions
you'll be asked today,

08:39.596 --> 08:41.129
do you intend
to tell the truth?

08:41.162 --> 08:42.129
Yes.

08:42.162 --> 08:44.029
Are you married?

08:44.062 --> 08:45.796
No.

08:45.830 --> 08:47.696
Have you ever been married?

08:47.730 --> 08:49.129
No.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.796
Do you have children?

08:50.830 --> 08:52.196
No.

08:52.229 --> 08:54.897
Did you ever commit
a minor traffic violation?

08:54.930 --> 08:57.463
Yes.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.963
Are you now in Mississippi?

08:58.997 --> 09:00.863
No.

09:00.897 --> 09:03.429
Have you ever revealed
any classified information

09:03.463 --> 09:05.630
to anyone without
proper security clearance?

09:05.663 --> 09:07.229
No.

09:07.263 --> 09:09.596
Have you ever taken
any illegal drugs?

09:10.663 --> 09:13.329
Yes.

09:13.363 --> 09:15.296
Have you taken
any illegal drugs

09:15.329 --> 09:17.796
since joining
the Central Intelligence Agency?

09:17.830 --> 09:19.696
No.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.096
Did you pass a razor blade
to Afzal Hamid?

09:26.129 --> 09:27.963
No.

09:41.129 --> 09:43.796
Okay.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.229
Here we go.

09:49.663 --> 09:51.696
All ready, sir?

09:55.296 --> 09:59.129
Um, is your name David Estes?

09:59.162 --> 10:01.663
Yes.

10:01.696 --> 10:05.096
Do you work for the Central
Intelligence Agency?

10:05.129 --> 10:06.263
Yes.

10:06.296 --> 10:08.296
Are you married?

10:08.329 --> 10:10.963
You know, I was married,
but I cheated on her,

10:10.997 --> 10:12.696
so that kind of soured things.

10:15.029 --> 10:17.162
Is that a no?

10:19.229 --> 10:21.329
No.

10:23.363 --> 10:25.363
No. Okay.

10:25.396 --> 10:27.730
Uh, do you have children?

10:27.763 --> 10:29.563
Yes.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.229
Not that they're talking to me.

10:32.263 --> 10:35.863
Did you pass a razor blade
to Afzal Hamid?

10:35.897 --> 10:37.329
No.

10:46.530 --> 10:48.229
Find anything?

10:48.263 --> 10:49.696
Eight million fingerprints,

10:49.730 --> 10:51.930
a man's belt from Macy's--
size 32--

10:51.963 --> 10:53.496
couple of takeout
food containers

10:53.530 --> 10:55.263
from a local
Chinese restaurant.

10:55.296 --> 10:56.496
Condoms.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.596
Condoms? What else?

10:58.630 --> 11:00.997
A six-pack of diet Coke
in the refrigerator.

11:02.263 --> 11:04.196
That's it?

11:04.229 --> 11:06.196
Interview the neighbors?

11:06.229 --> 11:08.563
In progress.

11:08.596 --> 11:09.997
Her?

11:10.029 --> 11:13.429
Not yet.

11:17.596 --> 11:19.596
I apologize for all
the commotion, ma'am.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.196
We'll be out of your hair soon.

11:21.229 --> 11:22.730
Oh, this is very exciting.

11:22.763 --> 11:24.963
It's not often we get
a murderer living

11:24.997 --> 11:27.263
in the neighborhood.
Murderer?

11:27.296 --> 11:29.363
That's what Marilyn
across the street said--

11:29.396 --> 11:30.696
a cold-blooded murderer

11:30.730 --> 11:32.630
raped and strangled
some poor girl

11:32.663 --> 11:35.696
over in Fairfax County.
Whew! Lock your doors tight tonight.

11:35.730 --> 11:37.730
Oh, I will.

11:39.062 --> 11:41.530
Mr. Jawdal moved in
about, uh...

11:41.563 --> 11:44.296
three weeks ago?
That's right.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.363
Anything you can tell me
about him?

11:46.396 --> 11:49.363
He was very quiet and polite.

11:49.396 --> 11:51.596
They pretty much
kept to themselves.

11:51.630 --> 11:53.229
They?

11:53.263 --> 11:55.296
He and his wife.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.930
- What happened? - I don't know. Someone must
have found out about the house.

11:59.963 --> 12:00.930
How?
I don't know.

12:00.963 --> 12:01.930
Where are we going?

12:01.963 --> 12:04.897
Someplace safe.
Says who?

12:04.930 --> 12:07.296
This is nuts.

12:08.363 --> 12:09.596
There's no one there.

12:09.630 --> 12:10.997
Yeah? How do you know?

12:11.029 --> 12:12.329
I know. Relax, okay?

12:12.363 --> 12:13.930
We're fine.
Fine?

12:13.963 --> 12:15.730
Are you kidding me?
We're not fine.

12:15.763 --> 12:16.830
We're fucked!

12:26.096 --> 12:28.196
Raqim?
What?

12:30.796 --> 12:33.129
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this.

12:36.329 --> 12:39.429
You didn't drag me into it.

12:39.463 --> 12:41.196
Okay?

12:41.229 --> 12:43.863
I dragged myself into it.

12:46.730 --> 12:50.496
I am a victim of
your fabulousness.

12:52.830 --> 12:54.496
Are you saying I'm fabulous?

12:54.530 --> 12:56.696
Yes, I am.

12:56.730 --> 12:58.897
You are so full of shit.

13:07.363 --> 13:11.363
<i>I asked all of you
here</i> <i>today to help me</i>

13:11.396 --> 13:15.296
say good-bye
to my former husband,

13:15.329 --> 13:17.329
Tom Walker.

13:21.530 --> 13:23.630
This has been a...

13:23.663 --> 13:25.863
very difficult...

13:25.897 --> 13:27.863
eight years.

13:30.263 --> 13:32.663
And now finally we can...

13:32.696 --> 13:36.596
give Tom the farewell
he deserves.

13:45.329 --> 13:49.029
Tom, uh, always said
that Nick Brody

13:49.062 --> 13:51.162
was his closest friend.

13:51.196 --> 13:53.162
And Nick was with Tom

13:53.196 --> 13:55.496
when he died.

13:56.596 --> 13:58.696
Nick.

14:31.463 --> 14:33.796
Tom Walker was a good man.

14:37.162 --> 14:39.830
A true Marine...

14:39.863 --> 14:42.596
and the best shot
I ever encountered, bar n...

14:42.630 --> 14:43.796
Sorry.

14:49.229 --> 14:50.596
Sorry.

15:01.263 --> 15:03.796
Tom was the opposite
of pretentious,

15:03.830 --> 15:05.596
whatever <i>that</i> is.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.530
Humble?

15:08.563 --> 15:13.029
He just wanted to get the job
done and get back to his family.

15:39.596 --> 15:41.796
Staff Sergeant Calhoun?

15:48.062 --> 15:49.263
Present!

15:49.296 --> 15:50.463
Private First Class

15:50.496 --> 15:51.630
Fernandez?

15:53.162 --> 15:54.296
Present!

15:54.329 --> 15:56.429
Private First Class Wakefield?

15:58.029 --> 15:59.463
Present.

15:59.496 --> 16:00.663
Captain Faber?

16:00.696 --> 16:02.429
Present!

16:02.463 --> 16:04.696
Private First Class Green?

16:04.730 --> 16:06.763
Present.

16:06.796 --> 16:09.229
Corporal Walker?

16:14.162 --> 16:17.630
Corporal Thomas Walker?

16:23.096 --> 16:25.296
Corporal Thomas...

16:25.329 --> 16:28.162
Patrick...

16:28.196 --> 16:30.696
Walker.

16:55.096 --> 16:57.429
Good service.
Yeah, it was really good.

16:57.463 --> 16:59.229
Will you excuse me?

16:59.263 --> 17:01.396
I'll be back in a minute, all right?
Mm-hmm.

17:01.429 --> 17:02.796
Okay.
Okay? All right.

17:15.930 --> 17:17.363
Sergeant Brody?

17:17.396 --> 17:18.530
Yeah?

17:18.563 --> 17:21.363
Hey. That must
have been hard.

17:21.396 --> 17:22.663
Yeah.

17:22.695 --> 17:24.563
Hey, I hate to do
this right now,

17:24.596 --> 17:25.730
but my bosses

17:25.762 --> 17:27.363
kind of insist.

17:27.396 --> 17:31.062
We need you to come out to
Langley to take a polygraph.

17:31.096 --> 17:32.530
Why?

17:32.563 --> 17:34.796
I'm afraid that's classified.

17:34.830 --> 17:36.429
Can you come out today?

17:36.463 --> 17:38.363
Is this to do with Hamid?

17:38.396 --> 17:40.763
I can't say.
I'm sorry.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.463
Well, I got to go
back to the reception.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.263
They're having it at my house.

17:46.296 --> 17:47.696
Oh, um...

17:47.730 --> 17:49.129
how about tomorrow?

17:49.162 --> 17:51.263
10:00 a.m.?

17:51.296 --> 17:52.596
Okay.

17:52.630 --> 17:55.162
Okay.

18:06.997 --> 18:09.429
Faisel's got a woman with him--
maybe a girlfriend,

18:09.463 --> 18:11.263
maybe a wife,
maybe just a cohort.

18:11.296 --> 18:12.329
She's Caucasian,
mid-20s,

18:12.363 --> 18:13.496
blond hair, blue/green eyes,

18:13.530 --> 18:14.963
depending who you talk to.

18:14.997 --> 18:17.329
Caucasian?
Yep.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.496
What do we know about her?
Nothing.

18:19.530 --> 18:20.830
We lifted a bunch
of fingerprints

18:20.863 --> 18:22.630
from the house--
we're hoping at least

18:22.663 --> 18:25.062
one of them will be hers and that we'll
be able to I.D. her.

18:25.096 --> 18:27.263
Hey, can we change gears
for a second?

18:27.296 --> 18:29.096
When this is all over,

18:29.129 --> 18:31.730
I'd like to go
back to the field.

18:31.763 --> 18:34.329
I thought you were
done with the field.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.530
Mira's been offered a job

18:35.563 --> 18:36.963
heading up
the Red Cross in India,

18:36.997 --> 18:38.663
and Ed Welles retires
in a few months,

18:38.696 --> 18:40.129
so, you know, I thought...
You thought

18:40.162 --> 18:41.463
you'd end
your illustrious career

18:41.496 --> 18:42.997
as the New Delhi Station Chief.

18:43.029 --> 18:46.930
Who said anything about
ending my illustrious career?

18:46.963 --> 18:49.863
I'll take it up
to the seventh floor.

18:49.897 --> 18:51.763
Thanks.

18:54.663 --> 18:55.630
Sir.
Yeah?

18:55.663 --> 18:56.630
Faisel's license plate.

18:56.663 --> 18:57.763
Toll booth on I-70
caught it.

18:57.796 --> 18:58.863
Where on I-70?

18:58.897 --> 19:00.530
20 miles west of Baltimore.

19:00.563 --> 19:02.496
- When?
- Five hours ago.

19:02.530 --> 19:04.329
Well, if they stayed on I-70,
they should be somewhere

19:04.363 --> 19:05.630
around Columbus, Ohio, by now.

19:05.663 --> 19:06.997
Alert the Ohio State Police.
We also

19:07.029 --> 19:08.796
have a photo
of Faisel and the girl

19:08.830 --> 19:10.963
- Run her face through the databases.
- Also see if

19:10.997 --> 19:13.129
that fancy new face-recognition
software gets us anything.

19:13.162 --> 19:16.229
Also try and match her face to anyone
who popped up because of fingerprints.

19:36.730 --> 19:38.863
Raqim?

19:42.563 --> 19:45.096
We're here.

19:45.129 --> 19:47.663
This is it?

19:47.696 --> 19:50.162
You sure?

19:50.196 --> 19:53.363
This is where they
said we'd be safe.

20:23.463 --> 20:26.062
They said
they'd meet us here?

20:28.796 --> 20:31.863
They said to sit tight
and they'd contact us.

21:15.596 --> 21:17.730
- Wait! Don't open the door.
- What?

21:17.763 --> 21:20.363
- Why? Why? - Don't open the door. Close
that, close that gently.

21:20.396 --> 21:22.730
Gently.

21:22.763 --> 21:24.796
Get back in the car.

21:42.763 --> 21:44.263
Oh, fuck,
oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

21:44.296 --> 21:46.263
We're okay.
Oh, fuck. You keep saying that!

21:46.296 --> 21:47.329
Because it's true!

21:47.363 --> 21:48.763
You sure there was a bomb?

21:48.796 --> 21:50.263
I could see the trigger--
pressure-released.

21:50.296 --> 21:52.830
Open the door and boom-- very
simple and very effective.

21:52.863 --> 21:54.897
What? How do you
know this shit?

21:54.930 --> 21:56.796
They... they-they
trained me.

21:56.830 --> 21:58.029
They trained you?!

21:58.062 --> 21:59.930
You never told me that!
Does it matter?

21:59.963 --> 22:01.129
Yes, it does matter!

22:01.162 --> 22:02.863
We are supposed to be
in a relationship!

22:02.897 --> 22:05.496
We are supposed to be
honest with each other!

22:05.530 --> 22:06.963
We should turn ourselves in.

22:06.997 --> 22:09.029
And spend the rest of our
lives being interrogated

22:09.062 --> 22:10.463
in some offshore
torture chamber?

22:10.496 --> 22:12.463
We haven't actually
broken any law.

22:12.496 --> 22:15.997
They can't hold us forever.
Tell that to the guys in Guantanamo.

22:18.396 --> 22:20.463
We got to get rid of this car.

What went on over there, Nick?

23:43.863 --> 23:45.830
How'd you and Walker get hit?

23:46.897 --> 23:49.162
Well...

23:49.196 --> 23:51.062
...we were dug in.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.663
You know, uh, next thing I know,

23:53.696 --> 23:58.029
we're taking fire
from all sides and, uh...

23:58.062 --> 24:00.329
and we ate dirt and prayed.

24:00.363 --> 24:01.997
They were waiting for you.

24:02.029 --> 24:03.229
Somebody screwed up.

24:03.263 --> 24:05.329
Somebody always screws up.

24:05.363 --> 24:07.196
Rear echelon motherfuckers.

24:07.229 --> 24:08.463
Mm-hmm.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.863
You are so full of shit, Brody.

24:11.897 --> 24:13.096
Lauder, shut the fuck up.

24:13.129 --> 24:14.696
No, no,

24:14.730 --> 24:16.463
I think it's important

24:16.496 --> 24:19.963
to state for the record,

24:19.997 --> 24:24.930
in case anybody's wondering,
which they're not...

24:24.963 --> 24:28.129
but hey,

24:28.162 --> 24:31.696
the record's
the record--

24:31.730 --> 24:33.096
Brody is full of shit.

24:34.596 --> 24:37.530
Right up to his
fucking eyeballs.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.396
It's always good sharing
a beer with you, Lauder.

24:40.429 --> 24:42.630
Exactly when did Wild Man Brody

24:42.663 --> 24:44.463
become a dick-
sucking war hero,

24:44.496 --> 24:47.263
trotted out by the brass

24:47.296 --> 24:49.763
so all the fucking
morons in this country

24:49.796 --> 24:52.663
could have something
to feel good about,

24:52.696 --> 24:54.796
so they'd stop asking:
What's the point,

24:54.830 --> 24:58.096
what the fuck are we even
doing in Iraq and Afghanistan?

24:58.129 --> 25:01.229
And when did you,
who once told me

25:01.263 --> 25:04.997
you just wanted
to come back in one piece,

25:05.029 --> 25:08.496
become the Boy Scout poster
boy for fucking recruitment,

25:08.530 --> 25:10.796
suckering another
couple thousand boys

25:10.830 --> 25:12.596
from fucking Indiana

25:12.630 --> 25:15.296
and the Bronx to go out and get

25:15.329 --> 25:17.963
their fucking legs blown off?

25:19.730 --> 25:22.496
What happened to you?

25:23.530 --> 25:25.830
Here's my question:

25:25.863 --> 25:30.563
how come Walker died
and you came back alive?

25:30.596 --> 25:33.496
What's that about?

25:33.530 --> 25:37.196
Huh, what's that about?

25:37.229 --> 25:39.196
Luck, Lauder,

25:39.229 --> 25:41.997
that's what
it's all about--

25:42.029 --> 25:43.496
good luck and bad luck.

25:43.530 --> 25:45.363
I'm glad you brought up
the subject of luck.

25:45.396 --> 25:47.730
Mike, you got anything

25:47.763 --> 25:50.196
to say about that, you being
an expert on luck and all?

25:50.229 --> 25:51.963
You're such an asshole.

25:53.596 --> 25:54.963
Can I be honest?

25:54.997 --> 25:56.863
I'll be honest.

25:56.897 --> 25:58.096
Why not?

25:58.129 --> 25:59.863
We're all compadres, right,

25:59.897 --> 26:03.563
brothers in arms
and all that crap?

26:03.596 --> 26:06.396
While you were away,
there's not a man here

26:06.429 --> 26:08.630
who didn't want to bend
your wife over the sink

26:08.663 --> 26:10.029
and fuck her up the ass.

26:10.062 --> 26:12.730
You son of a bitch.

26:17.396 --> 26:18.563
Come on, come on.

26:29.329 --> 26:31.496
You were my friend.

26:42.763 --> 26:45.329
Brody.

26:45.363 --> 26:46.763
Brody.

26:56.796 --> 26:59.296
Fuck.

27:02.329 --> 27:05.463
Meet Aileen Margaret Morgan.

27:05.496 --> 27:08.296
28 years old, brown hair,
sometimes dyed blondish,

27:08.329 --> 27:11.496
blue eyes, five-
five, 110 pounds.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.530
This photo was
taken six years ago

27:13.563 --> 27:15.363
when she was arrested
protesting outside

27:15.396 --> 27:17.863
a G-8 meeting in Edinburgh.
The one to the right

27:17.897 --> 27:20.830
was taken six months ago for
her current driver's license.

27:20.863 --> 27:22.997
Somehow she made the journey
from Connecticut schoolgirl

27:23.029 --> 27:24.296
to terrorist's girlfriend

27:24.329 --> 27:25.863
involved in a plot
against America.

27:25.897 --> 27:27.129
How?

27:27.162 --> 27:28.696
Why?

27:28.730 --> 27:30.196
Dig into her history.

27:30.229 --> 27:32.029
Where did she grow up,
where did she go to school,

27:32.062 --> 27:33.997
who were her friends, where
and when did she meet Faisel?

27:34.029 --> 27:35.363
All of it.
Anything more about the car?

27:35.396 --> 27:37.029
I want every cop

27:37.062 --> 27:38.630
on the eastern seaboard
looking for that damn thing.

27:38.663 --> 27:40.029
Sir?
Yeah.

27:40.062 --> 27:41.329
I'm sorry to bother you,
but it's...

27:41.363 --> 27:43.196
What?
Spit it out, spit it out.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.496
It's time, sir.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.863
Anybody know what
he's talking about?

27:46.897 --> 27:48.796
I think it's time
for your polygraph.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.162
Polygraph?

27:50.196 --> 27:52.162
I don't have time
for a fucking polygraph.

27:52.196 --> 27:53.730
It's all right, Saul,
you'll be fine.

27:53.763 --> 27:55.296
If anything comes up,
I'll come and get you.

27:55.329 --> 27:57.496
You're not gonna miss
anything important.

27:59.496 --> 28:01.329
Please help me out here.

28:01.363 --> 28:03.196
This is how we're
going to get Brody.

28:05.196 --> 28:07.596
Look for any contacts overseas,
especially in the Middle East.

28:07.630 --> 28:09.029
School, exchange programs,

28:09.062 --> 28:11.596
graduate school,
kibbutz, anything.

28:11.630 --> 28:12.897
This is
the polygraph room, sir.

28:12.930 --> 28:14.162
Oh, is that right?
Hello, Larry.

28:14.196 --> 28:15.396
Hello, Saul.

28:15.429 --> 28:17.563
How's everything?
Oh, just peachy.

28:19.062 --> 28:21.429
Okay.

28:21.463 --> 28:22.997
Would you hold that for me?

28:23.029 --> 28:24.997
Thank you.

28:28.796 --> 28:32.930
Could you hold this
for me right here?

28:32.963 --> 28:35.930
Born December 25, 1983,
Houston, Texas.

28:35.963 --> 28:38.429
Father is Owen Robert Morgan,

28:38.463 --> 28:41.730
mother is
Abigail Sarah Lifeliter.

28:41.763 --> 28:45.897
RAKOR vice president.

28:45.930 --> 28:47.396
He ever work in
the Middle East?

28:47.429 --> 28:50.463
Saudi Arabia, 1991 to '96.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.463
Looks like he's a pretty big
deal in the oil business.

28:53.496 --> 28:57.096
Okay, so we've got
a rich American girl

28:57.129 --> 28:58.796
living in Saudi
Arabia for five years

28:58.830 --> 29:03.429
between the ages
of eight and 13.

29:03.463 --> 29:05.429
When did Faisel leave Saudi
Arabia to study in the States?

29:05.463 --> 29:07.463
1995.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.963
So they overlapped
by four years.

29:14.496 --> 29:16.830
What happened, Aileen?

29:16.863 --> 29:18.930
What did you see?

29:20.963 --> 29:23.162
Is your name Saul Berenson?

29:23.196 --> 29:25.296
For Christ's sake.

29:26.429 --> 29:28.730
Is your name Saul Berenson?

29:28.763 --> 29:30.229
Yes.

29:30.263 --> 29:32.162
Saul, calm down.

29:32.196 --> 29:33.596
We've been through this before.

29:33.630 --> 29:35.963
Take a deep breath,
think of something pleasant.

29:35.997 --> 29:37.997
Okay?

29:40.296 --> 29:42.496
Okay.
Okay.

29:42.530 --> 29:45.496
Uh, do you live
at 413 Circle Drive,

29:45.530 --> 29:47.530
Washington, D.C.?

29:47.563 --> 29:49.029
Yes.

29:49.062 --> 29:51.329
There we go.

29:51.363 --> 29:53.496
Much better.

29:53.530 --> 29:56.296
Do you work for the
Central Intelligence Agency?

29:56.329 --> 29:57.596
Yes.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.530
Is your office
on the fifth floor?

30:00.563 --> 30:02.329
Yes.

30:02.363 --> 30:04.196
Are you planning
on telling the truth today

30:04.229 --> 30:07.763
about Afzal Hamid
and the razor blade?

30:07.796 --> 30:10.263
Yes.

30:11.696 --> 30:14.162
Did you pass Afzal Hamid
a razor blade?

30:14.196 --> 30:16.129
No.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.897
Saul.

30:18.930 --> 30:21.363
You got to relax
or we'll be here all night.

30:21.396 --> 30:22.963
I can't be here all night.

30:22.997 --> 30:25.162
We've got an emergency
going on out there.

30:25.196 --> 30:26.530
The real world will not wait

30:26.563 --> 30:28.997
for these bureau-
fucking-cratic idiocies.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.630
We'll finish it tomorrow.

30:34.229 --> 30:36.296
Saul.

30:36.329 --> 30:38.630
Where'd she go after Princeton?

30:38.663 --> 30:40.029
Jordan-- the Peace Corps.

30:40.062 --> 30:41.696
How long?
Two years.

30:41.730 --> 30:44.563
Do any traveling
while she was there?

30:44.596 --> 30:46.630
Uh, Egypt, Lebanon--
oh, here we go--

30:46.663 --> 30:49.563
SaArabia, March 22
to March 30, 2004.

30:49.596 --> 30:52.229
Any overlaps with Faisel?

30:52.263 --> 30:54.897
March 26 to 27, 2004.

30:54.930 --> 30:56.997
Faisel visits his grandmother.

30:57.029 --> 30:59.429
Aileen Morgan and Raqim
Faisel met somewhere

30:59.463 --> 31:01.563
between 1991 and 1996

31:01.596 --> 31:02.897
in Saudi Arabia.

31:02.930 --> 31:05.930
They reacquainted themselves
there March 26 to 27,

31:05.963 --> 31:07.596
also in Saudi Arabia.

31:07.630 --> 31:10.296
They were childhood friends.

31:12.763 --> 31:15.663
That was fast.

31:15.696 --> 31:18.463
I got to go back,
finish tomorrow.

31:18.496 --> 31:20.763
I figured you might
need me out here.

31:26.396 --> 31:30.696
A naive, weak-willed American
rich girl falls madly in love

31:30.730 --> 31:34.029
with a Saudi engineer
who happens to be a terrorist.

31:34.062 --> 31:37.029
Sacrifices all to be with him
and help fulfill his mission,

31:37.062 --> 31:38.630
whatever the fuck that is.

31:38.663 --> 31:40.429
Sound convincing?

31:42.029 --> 31:43.997
Why hasn't she cracked

31:44.029 --> 31:46.496
at least a little bit,

31:46.530 --> 31:49.863
called her parents,
run away, something?

31:49.897 --> 31:52.663
Things are getting
pretty hairy for an amateur.

31:54.296 --> 31:56.296
Maybe we've got it backwards.

31:56.329 --> 31:58.530
Maybe she's the one
driving this.

31:59.596 --> 32:01.897
She's the terrorist?

32:10.263 --> 32:12.229
Carrie here.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.496
It's me--

32:13.530 --> 32:15.897
Brody.

32:17.663 --> 32:19.563
Yeah, y-y-you gave me
your number.

32:19.596 --> 32:20.963
Should I hang up?

32:20.997 --> 32:22.596
What's wrong?

32:24.997 --> 32:27.029
I can't do the polygraph
tomorrow.

32:27.062 --> 32:28.897
Why not?

32:28.930 --> 32:31.930
I just can't, I'm a mess.

32:31.963 --> 32:33.596
I've had the worst fucking day.

32:33.630 --> 32:37.096
I could tell them my name
and it would sound like a lie.

32:39.329 --> 32:41.229

32:41.263 --> 32:44.429

32:46.229 --> 32:48.329

Oh, you didn't have to come.

Uh, I'll have
whatever he's having.

33:05.596 --> 33:07.162
Bourbon, straight bourbon.

33:07.196 --> 33:08.997
Okay.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.496
What's the difference,
I always wondered.

33:11.530 --> 33:15.830
Straight's been aged for two
years in charred oak barrels.

33:20.162 --> 33:22.830
Ugh, still tastes
like gasoline to me.

33:25.830 --> 33:27.196
What happened to your hand?

33:27.229 --> 33:29.196
I decked my best friend.

33:29.229 --> 33:30.830
Ouch.

33:30.863 --> 33:32.630
Hurts like a motherfucker,
excuse my French.

33:32.663 --> 33:35.363
Uh, I was talking
about your friend.

33:35.396 --> 33:37.563
Don't--
he's an asshole.

33:37.596 --> 33:39.663
Want to tell me about it?

33:41.062 --> 33:44.029
You ever been married
by any chance?

33:44.062 --> 33:46.229
Nope.
Why not?

33:46.263 --> 33:51.029
It just hasn't felt right
quite yet.

33:52.663 --> 33:55.296
Or as important
as what I do for a living.

33:56.863 --> 33:59.463
Plus the guy I was seeing
when I left for Iraq decided

33:59.496 --> 34:00.930
I wasn't worth the wait.

34:00.963 --> 34:03.463
Nice.
Eh, I can't say I really blame him.

34:03.496 --> 34:05.296
I mean...

34:05.329 --> 34:07.696
...it's not like I was
Little Miss Faithful over there.

34:08.963 --> 34:11.630
Hey, if you don't slow down,

34:11.663 --> 34:13.795
I'm never gonna be
able to catch up.

34:13.830 --> 34:16.129
How come, when I met you
at the safe house the other day,

34:16.161 --> 34:18.196
you pretended like we hadn't
bumped into each other

34:18.228 --> 34:20.329
at the, uh, support group?

34:20.362 --> 34:22.897
Oh, that.

34:22.929 --> 34:24.763
Yeah, that.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.795
You mean aside from the fact
that I'm not supposed

34:26.830 --> 34:29.530
to get help from counselors
outside the agency?

34:29.563 --> 34:32.129
Is there another reason?

34:34.062 --> 34:36.563
I don't know.

34:38.463 --> 34:42.663
Standing there
that night in the rain.

34:44.196 --> 34:46.963
I figured, who else had to know?

34:49.897 --> 34:51.596
What?

34:56.730 --> 34:58.563
I like it when
life is like that.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.496
Like what, wet?

35:01.463 --> 35:03.863
Heightened somehow.

35:06.396 --> 35:09.096
When I was a girl, my friends
and I used to play chicken

35:09.129 --> 35:10.830
with the train on the tracks
near our house,

35:10.863 --> 35:15.229
and no one could ever beat me,
not even the boys.

35:27.530 --> 35:29.563
I can't stand the Wizards.

35:29.596 --> 35:32.563
What kind of name is that anyway
for a basketball team--

35:32.596 --> 35:33.997
the Wizards?

35:34.029 --> 35:36.596
What are they, like,
magicians in hoods?

35:37.897 --> 35:39.329
Redskins?

35:39.363 --> 35:41.162
I love the Redskins.
Me, too.

35:41.196 --> 35:42.763
No, I grew up on the Redskins.

35:42.796 --> 35:46.196
My father thought
he <i>was</i> a Redskin.

35:46.229 --> 35:49.196
He used to take me to games
in the freezing cold.

35:49.229 --> 35:51.129
One time we wore sleeping bags.

35:52.496 --> 35:55.296
We climbed in, we zipped 'em up.

35:55.329 --> 35:56.763
All you could see was our eyes.

35:56.796 --> 35:58.129
You have great eyes.

35:58.162 --> 35:59.763
Thank you.

35:59.796 --> 36:01.029
Kind of secretive.

36:01.062 --> 36:03.530
Ah, comes with the job.

36:03.563 --> 36:05.730
Secretive eyes--
it's a requirement,

36:05.763 --> 36:08.062
Yeah?
Really.

36:08.096 --> 36:09.596
Oh, Jesus, we drank too much.

36:09.630 --> 36:10.863
Yeah, we did.

36:10.897 --> 36:12.096
Oh, I hope I don't puke.

36:12.129 --> 36:13.363
You're gonna puke?

36:13.396 --> 36:15.096
No.
You all right?

36:15.129 --> 36:17.530
I'm half Irish.
The Irish don't puke?

36:17.563 --> 36:20.696
Nah, only when we have
to salute the British.

36:29.329 --> 36:31.696
This is me.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.263
Want to know
what it's all about?

36:39.296 --> 36:40.930
The polygraph?

36:40.963 --> 36:42.930
I thought that was classified.

36:42.963 --> 36:44.796
It is.

36:44.830 --> 36:48.229
Hamid's dead.

36:48.263 --> 36:51.129
Someone slipped him
a razorblade in the safe house.

36:51.162 --> 36:53.530
Slit his wrists.

How can you just sit there
listening to wailing cowboys

38:12.730 --> 38:14.496

are falling apart?

38:14.530 --> 38:16.363
I need to relax. I can't think
straight if I don't relax.

38:16.396 --> 38:18.730
No, what we need
is a fucking plan.

38:18.763 --> 38:21.429
What if we went to Mexico?

38:21.463 --> 38:24.429
No. We should turn ourselves in.
No.

38:24.463 --> 38:26.062
Yes, we can ask for

39:50.730 --> 39:52.897
Oh.

39:52.930 --> 39:56.863
I've put in
for the New Delhi station.

39:56.897 --> 40:01.062
Ed Welles retires
in a few months.

40:01.096 --> 40:04.096
I believe
I've got Estes' backing.

40:04.129 --> 40:06.429
Take the new job.

40:06.463 --> 40:08.463
I can come with you.

40:10.897 --> 40:13.296
I don't want you
to come with me.

40:13.329 --> 40:15.563
What?

40:15.596 --> 40:17.396
I want to go alone.

40:17.429 --> 40:20.129
I <i>need</i> to go alone.

40:20.162 --> 40:22.663
Why?

40:22.696 --> 40:25.096
I just do.

40:27.263 --> 40:28.830
For how long?

40:28.863 --> 40:32.296
I-I don't know.

40:32.329 --> 40:33.830
A week?

40:33.863 --> 40:36.329
I don't know.

40:36.363 --> 40:39.229
A month?

40:39.263 --> 40:41.463
What?

40:41.496 --> 40:43.830
I don't know.

40:48.796 --> 40:51.530
New job?

40:51.563 --> 40:54.162
Just a ploy?

40:54.196 --> 40:56.930
Your way
of letting me down gently?

40:56.963 --> 40:59.329
Saul...

40:59.363 --> 41:03.463
we're like good friends
sharing a house.

41:03.496 --> 41:06.463
You do the dishes,
I water the garden.

41:06.496 --> 41:09.930
You are watching football,
I watch cooking shows.

41:09.963 --> 41:12.830
You play golf, I do yoga.

41:17.329 --> 41:20.530
Sounds perfect.

41:47.162 --> 41:49.796
Come on. We're late.

41:51.863 --> 41:54.263
Come on.

41:59.763 --> 42:02.196
Have a good day at school,
sugar bunny.

42:03.429 --> 42:05.830
Right.

42:05.863 --> 42:07.997
Dana.

42:25.830 --> 42:27.663
Did you go to college?

42:27.696 --> 42:29.363
Yes.

42:29.396 --> 42:31.329
Did you major
in Political Science?

42:31.363 --> 42:33.229
Yes.

42:33.263 --> 42:37.930
Have you ever sold secrets
to an agent of another country?

42:37.963 --> 42:39.396
No.

42:39.429 --> 42:40.830
Are you married?

42:40.863 --> 42:44.663
No, not really.

42:45.897 --> 42:48.596
Yes or no?

42:51.029 --> 42:53.396
I don't know, Larry.

42:54.630 --> 42:57.229
Okay?

42:57.263 --> 42:59.830
Maybe yes, maybe no.

42:59.863 --> 43:01.229
Technically?

43:01.263 --> 43:04.229
Technically, yes.

43:04.263 --> 43:07.696
Did you give

43:07.730 --> 43:10.029
Afzal Hamid a razorblade?

43:10.062 --> 43:12.429
No.

43:13.663 --> 43:16.029
That's it.

43:16.062 --> 43:18.396
You're free.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.129
Oh.

43:24.496 --> 43:26.863
I hope I never see you again.

43:26.897 --> 43:28.796
Oh, you will.

43:28.830 --> 43:31.229
Thanks, buddy.

43:45.596 --> 43:47.563
Trouble at home.

43:47.596 --> 43:49.463
It'll blow over.

43:49.496 --> 43:51.096
Brody next?

43:51.129 --> 43:53.129
Brody's next.

43:53.162 --> 43:54.897
Assuming he shows up.

43:54.930 --> 43:56.596
This is it, Saul.

43:56.630 --> 43:58.463
Finally.

43:58.496 --> 43:59.930
Let's hope.

44:25.129 --> 44:26.997
Come on in,
Sergeant Brody.

44:27.029 --> 44:28.496
Just stand over here.

44:28.530 --> 44:29.997
This won't take long.

44:30.029 --> 44:31.997
Can you just, uh,
take your jacket off?

44:32.029 --> 44:34.630
You can put it on
the chair there.

44:40.997 --> 44:42.363
Oh...

44:55.730 --> 44:56.997
Okay.

44:57.029 --> 45:00.062
Now, just relax

45:00.096 --> 45:02.863
and answer all the questions

45:02.897 --> 45:06.396
honestly, yes or no.

45:06.429 --> 45:07.863
All set?
Mm-hmm.

45:07.897 --> 45:09.897
Okay.

45:09.930 --> 45:13.129
Is your name Nicholas Brody?

45:13.162 --> 45:14.696
Yes.

45:14.730 --> 45:17.263
Are you a member
of the U.S. Marine Corps?

45:17.296 --> 45:18.596
Yes.

45:18.630 --> 45:21.096
Do you intend
to tell the truth here today?

45:21.129 --> 45:22.930
Yes.

45:22.963 --> 45:25.429
Have you ever sold secrets
to a foreign government?

45:25.463 --> 45:27.062
No.

45:27.096 --> 45:29.229
Have you
ever been arrested?

45:29.263 --> 45:33.396
- Yes.
- I borrowed my dad's Pontiac one time.

45:33.429 --> 45:35.229
I was 15 years old.

45:35.263 --> 45:38.596
Have you ever been
arrested for a felony?

45:38.630 --> 45:40.263
No.

45:40.296 --> 45:43.162
Have you ever killed a man?

45:43.196 --> 45:44.830
Yes.

45:44.863 --> 45:48.062
Did you pass Afzal Hamid
a razorblade?

45:48.096 --> 45:49.062
No.

45:49.096 --> 45:50.963
Do you live at

45:50.997 --> 45:52.796
3319 West Chapman Street?

45:52.830 --> 45:54.463
Yes.

45:54.496 --> 45:56.196
Are you
sometimes called Nick?

45:56.229 --> 45:58.196
Yes.

45:58.229 --> 46:00.096
Is Boston the
capital of Massachusetts?

46:00.129 --> 46:01.763
Yes.

46:01.796 --> 46:03.296
Do you know Afzal Hamid?

46:03.329 --> 46:04.730
Yes.

46:04.763 --> 46:06.463
Did you
meet him in Syria?

46:06.496 --> 46:08.596
Yes.

46:08.630 --> 46:10.396
Did you slip him a razorblade?

46:10.429 --> 46:12.196
No.

46:12.229 --> 46:14.563
Ask him again.

46:15.796 --> 46:17.763
Did you slip

46:17.796 --> 46:20.229
Afzal Hamid a razorblade?

46:20.263 --> 46:23.496
No.

46:26.329 --> 46:29.229
Ask him if he's ever been
unfaithful to his wife.

46:31.663 --> 46:34.630
Go on, ask him.

46:34.663 --> 46:38.363
Have you ever been
unfaithful to your wife?

46:41.096 --> 46:43.496
No.

46:47.162 --> 46:49.730
Okay, Larry, wrap it up.

46:49.763 --> 46:52.563
Thank you, Sergeant Brody.

46:52.596 --> 46:53.763
That it?
We all done?

46:53.796 --> 46:55.296
We're all done.

46:55.329 --> 46:56.830
He's lying.

46:56.863 --> 46:58.630
He passed the polygraph.

46:58.663 --> 47:01.029
Same one you and I take
and flub every time.

47:01.062 --> 47:02.463
Or at least I do.

47:04.630 --> 47:08.263
It's... It's over.

47:08.296 --> 47:10.196
Man is clean.

47:10.229 --> 47:12.663
Saul...

47:13.863 --> 47:17.630
You can't deny the facts--

47:17.663 --> 47:19.429
what we just
witnessed--

47:19.463 --> 47:21.663
just 'cause you find
them inconvenient.

47:27.296 --> 47:29.663
So...

47:29.696 --> 47:33.029
now we know

47:33.062 --> 47:36.029
that Sergeant Brody's
been faithful to his wife.

47:36.062 --> 47:38.296
Question:

47:38.329 --> 47:39.897
Why do we care?

47:39.930 --> 47:41.396
What was that all about?

47:59.730 --> 48:01.496
Get in.
