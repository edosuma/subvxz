WEBVTT

00:19.145 --> 00:21.354
How come you get
the best part?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.481
I killed it.

00:25.735 --> 00:26.735
Be easier to hunt

00:26.736 --> 00:28.820
if we had one of them
fancy new weapons

00:28.821 --> 00:30.488
like the Mage gave to the Trosts.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.449
Aye.

00:32.450 --> 00:33.616
Can I please have some food?

00:33.617 --> 00:34.534
Shut it, boy!

00:36.328 --> 00:38.496
<i>Blasted bugaboos
in the woods!</i>

00:38.497 --> 00:41.125
<i>All sorts of weird
creatures out here.</i>

00:43.294 --> 00:44.669
Why are we keeping him alive, anyway?

00:44.670 --> 00:45.920
Those were the orders.

00:45.921 --> 00:49.549
He's a Dengdamor!
They blame the Trosts.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.343
Just as the Trosts
blame the Dengdamors

00:52.344 --> 00:54.429
for Pinkie Panto's disappearance.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.431
Well, it holds true
if the rat's alive or dead, though.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.725
<i>The Mage's plan
doesn't make any sense.</i>

00:58.726 --> 00:59.851
So...

00:59.852 --> 01:01.227
tell us,

01:01.228 --> 01:04.064
what's your plan
for conquering Wendimoor?

01:04.065 --> 01:05.441
Uh...

01:06.275 --> 01:07.777
That's what I thought.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.781
Nobody questions The Mage!

01:13.365 --> 01:14.450
Nobody!

01:32.301 --> 01:34.010
Come on, come on...

01:40.935 --> 01:43.603
What-what happened to the motel?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.272
This...

01:47.399 --> 01:49.400
What is this place?

01:49.401 --> 01:51.904
Oh, man, drummer, where are we?

02:02.373 --> 02:03.999
We're somewhere else.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.592
Oh...

03:05.186 --> 03:07.896
I'm so stupid.

03:07.897 --> 03:11.274
Magic real... Book...

03:11.275 --> 03:13.318
Dang wand came from somewhere...

03:13.319 --> 03:14.444
Now he's looking for me.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.490
<i>Mom! Open the door!</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:20.910
<i>I can hear you in there!</i>

03:22.870 --> 03:23.745
What do you want?

03:23.746 --> 03:25.038
I want my phone!

03:25.039 --> 03:26.164
Just...

03:26.165 --> 03:28.416
Just go away, please?

03:29.335 --> 03:31.085
Why are you acting crazy?

03:31.086 --> 03:32.128
I just want my--

03:32.129 --> 03:33.171
Look, you're gonna get your phone back

03:33.172 --> 03:35.424
when I give it back, you little asshole!

03:39.803 --> 03:41.804
Stupid...

03:41.805 --> 03:44.182
You won't take it from me.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.351
No...

03:46.644 --> 03:48.145
It's mine now.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.147
It's mine.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.818
What up? Bergsberg Sheriff's Department.

03:56.862 --> 03:57.946
Oh...

03:57.947 --> 03:59.739
That does sound like cause for concern.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.865
<i>We'll be right there.</i>

04:02.326 --> 04:04.452
Four members
of the Bergsberg County Book Club

04:04.453 --> 04:07.248
are... missing.

04:08.332 --> 04:09.832
I should probably investigate this.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.334
Probably.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.461
You wanna come with, partner?

04:13.462 --> 04:14.295
"Partner?"

04:14.296 --> 04:15.922
Uh... It's just an expression.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.715
What about them?

04:17.716 --> 04:19.050
I thought the whole reason we slept here

04:19.051 --> 04:21.219
was to keep an eye on the prisoners.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.553
Right.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.097
Ah, poop, okay, I forgot.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.224
I mean... I do drugs.

04:26.225 --> 04:28.268
Not now. Later.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.603
We left her alone before
and she was fine.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.607
Hobbs'll be here soon. It's not like
they can just walk out of their cells.

04:50.541 --> 04:51.583
Dirk?

04:55.296 --> 04:56.380
Dirk!

05:05.055 --> 05:06.222
Hobbs!
Sherlock, wake up.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.225
Dirk's gone.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.476
Gone?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.853
Yeah. Not good.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.021
I have an idea where he went.

05:13.022 --> 05:14.356
Also, why is this here?

05:16.066 --> 05:17.109
Oh, yeah.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.237
I should probably admit that
into evidence, shouldn't I?

05:28.954 --> 05:29.871
<i>Hobbs!</i>

05:29.872 --> 05:30.873
Yup.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.666
Hey!

05:34.543 --> 05:36.670
Hey, wake up.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.757
I brought you some food.

05:40.758 --> 05:43.426
I don't understand.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.595
How did you get out?

05:45.054 --> 05:47.221
Locks don't work on me.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.849
And I was-I was hungry.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.436
Can you open mine?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.440
Sorry, it's locked.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.526
Want a donut?

06:02.321 --> 06:03.572
Thank you, noble lady.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.949
Have you ever had Chinese food?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.910
Ken gave me Chinese food once.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.537
It's made of pigs.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.165
Mmm.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.042
You're a good person, Bart.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.377
I am?

06:17.378 --> 06:19.087
I'm a stranger in this world.

06:19.088 --> 06:21.215
You're the first person
to show me kindness.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.053
Yeah, well, it's just a donut.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.188
So, uh,

06:37.189 --> 06:38.439
<i>you're new to this place?</i>

06:38.440 --> 06:39.774
<i>You're not one of them, huh?</i>

06:39.775 --> 06:41.776
You're from, like,
another state or something?

06:41.777 --> 06:43.194
I'm a Baron Prince

06:43.195 --> 06:45.739
from the Valley of Inglenook
in the Kingdom of Wendimoor.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.658
That's just a bunch of noises.

06:53.122 --> 06:55.790
Who the hell are you guys?
Why are you dressed like that?

06:55.791 --> 06:57.875
Get off of me, assholes!

06:57.876 --> 06:59.919
Screw off, you stupid dicks!

07:04.299 --> 07:05.466
Get in there.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.723
Hey!

07:12.724 --> 07:15.017
Dungeons and Dragons,
we didn't do anything to you!

07:15.018 --> 07:18.396
We're supposed to detain
suspicious types, you wet rat.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.314
I don't even know how I got here!

07:20.315 --> 07:21.732
See how they're dressed?

07:21.733 --> 07:24.068
They're more witchakookoo types
from the forest.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.778
I'm not a witchakookoo.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.947
I am a frickin' person, okay?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.198
I'm a person!

07:29.199 --> 07:30.616
And my friend here is hurt,

07:30.617 --> 07:31.784
<i>and...and...</i>

07:31.785 --> 07:34.203
<i>you can't just
lock us up for no reason.</i>

07:34.204 --> 07:35.329
You can't.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.874
Let Lord Badevil figure it out.

07:40.335 --> 07:43.171
Hey, wait, where are you going?

07:43.172 --> 07:44.672
Hey, where are you go--

07:44.673 --> 07:46.716
God, I'm yelling...

07:46.717 --> 07:48.801
I'm yelling at the...

07:48.802 --> 07:49.635
<i>the knights.</i>

07:49.636 --> 07:50.470
<i>I'm...</i>

07:50.471 --> 07:52.889
God...

07:56.602 --> 07:58.395
You're not from Wendimoor, are you?

08:00.314 --> 08:01.355
No.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.983
Then welcome, traveler.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.318
My name is Farson Dengdamor.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.195
Just stop.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.696
Okay?

08:08.697 --> 08:10.072
All of this...

08:10.073 --> 08:12.450
Is that a unicorn?
Oh, my God--

08:21.627 --> 08:23.544
So, uh, listen,
I didn't get the chance to ask you,

08:23.545 --> 08:25.380
how is your sister
wrapped up in all this?

08:27.216 --> 08:29.258
She and I have
the same disease.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.635
It runs in the family.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.304
Well, actually, she had it first.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.348
Well, I pretended to have it first,

08:35.349 --> 08:38.518
and then she really got it,
and now I really have it.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.187
Uh-huh. Okay.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.065
You pretended to have the...

08:44.066 --> 08:46.150
You-you pretended to...
Why would you--

08:46.151 --> 08:47.610
I did some selfish things.

08:47.611 --> 08:51.030
Things I now really, really regret.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.824
Most of all, lying to Amanda.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.409
She wasn't happy when I told her.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.702
That's, you know, uh,

08:56.703 --> 08:58.955
karmically, that was
a good thing to do, I think,

08:58.956 --> 09:03.668
although I suppose you still
did end up with the disease, so...

09:03.669 --> 09:04.836
Oof.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.089
Where... where is she, then?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.048
I don't know.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.259
The last time I saw her,
she told me to get lost,

09:11.260 --> 09:13.302
<i>and then ran off
with these four insane guys</i>

09:13.303 --> 09:14.512
<i>who were following Dirk.</i>

09:14.513 --> 09:15.721
Now, with Blackwing after us--

09:15.722 --> 09:17.348
Blackwing, that's
the top-secret government agency

09:17.349 --> 09:18.349
that Dirk was talking about?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.934
This is all my fault.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.187
I brought her into all of this.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.735
Okay.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.154
You're okay.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.158
It's okay.

09:52.843 --> 09:53.969
He took my bike.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.723
That's a heck of a long ride. Dirk!

09:59.433 --> 10:01.101
Here, take this just in case.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.020
Dirk?

10:04.271 --> 10:05.272
Dirk!

10:06.398 --> 10:07.898
Maybe he's in the barn.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.525
Yup. Okay, I'm gonna
check upstairs.

10:18.702 --> 10:22.038
Phone lines haven't run
to this house in 50 years.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.252
Hello?

10:28.253 --> 10:29.420
Todd!

10:29.421 --> 10:31.255
Help me!
I have really messed up.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.757
I fell down some kind of hole.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.175
What? Where are you?

10:34.176 --> 10:35.468
You're like, in the basement?

10:35.469 --> 10:36.470
<i>No.</i>

10:37.054 --> 10:38.388
It's not a basement.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.813
Hey, you know when I said
I wanted out,

10:47.814 --> 10:50.107
I meant out of this room,
not just out of the cab.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.026
Just tell me what's on those disks.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.736
A lot.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.197
Tens of thousands of pages of files.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.698
You know the first
version of this program

10:57.699 --> 10:59.617
was called "Black Book"?

10:59.618 --> 11:01.327
Don't read it!

11:01.328 --> 11:03.037
- But last time you told me to read it--
- It's secret!

11:03.038 --> 11:04.163
No! No...

11:04.164 --> 11:05.081
- All right--
- No...

11:05.082 --> 11:06.082
Do you want me to decrypt this,

11:06.083 --> 11:07.249
and then you'll read it, or--

11:07.250 --> 11:10.544
No! I... Yeah, but, um...

11:10.545 --> 11:12.380
Only the...

11:12.381 --> 11:15.007
Okay, okay, just...

11:15.008 --> 11:18.636
Is there anything in there
about disappearing?

11:18.637 --> 11:20.346
Or people who can disappear?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.891
Or people who can make
other people disappear?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.690
Yes, actually,

11:30.691 --> 11:32.693
there's about four different types...

11:34.695 --> 11:36.487
You doing all right, man?
You look a bit agitated--

11:36.488 --> 11:38.072
I got a lot going on! Man!

11:38.073 --> 11:39.740
Okay, okay, take it easy.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.409
I just... I thought
this was a good idea.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.785
You know?

11:42.786 --> 11:45.913
I mean, we couldn't just
let you all stay out there,

11:45.914 --> 11:49.125
all you people with crazy abilities.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.544
I mean, what did you think
you were gonna do with them--

11:51.545 --> 11:52.878
I mean, us--

11:52.879 --> 11:54.464
I mean, did you think
you were going to crack us?

11:55.424 --> 11:57.299
Enslave a group of magic people,

11:57.300 --> 11:59.093
turn them into a team
of super soldiers

11:59.094 --> 12:01.887
out to strike down
the enemies of America?

12:01.888 --> 12:04.140
Sort of. I just, I...

12:04.141 --> 12:05.558
I just hit a rough patch, Ken.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.393
What happened, man?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.729
Something must have happened.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.069
The other Brotzman,

12:17.070 --> 12:18.237
the girl,

12:18.238 --> 12:20.239
and the fourth member
of Project Incubus,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.159
we had them cornered,

12:23.160 --> 12:26.912
and then they just disappeared.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.164
Into thin air.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.249
Just like Project Stupid Dirk!

12:30.250 --> 12:32.418
And-and then the guy
who's helping me,

12:32.419 --> 12:33.837
- Mr. Priest?
- Yeah?

12:34.755 --> 12:36.672
He's crazy.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.758
And I just, I need to know more.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.844
Do you understand?
I need to know a lot more.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.596
Or maybe...

12:43.597 --> 12:47.308
you could just know some stuff?

12:47.309 --> 12:49.268
I'll see what I can do.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.645
Okay.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.148
Dirk, calm down.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.357
Where are you?

12:55.358 --> 12:56.734
It looks like
the Cardenas house,

12:56.735 --> 12:58.068
only it's much bigger,

12:58.069 --> 12:59.528
<i>like, impossibly big,</i>

12:59.529 --> 13:01.864
and also fun and festive,

13:01.865 --> 13:03.699
but in awful ways.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.036
So you're inside the house, or--?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.121
I'm looking out the door now,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.582
and there is no outside, Todd.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.793
<i>Listen, this is just speculation,</i>

13:13.794 --> 13:16.421
but I may be in actual
Judeo-Christian Hell.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.131
Okay, okay,

13:19.132 --> 13:20.174
<i>look, back up--</i>

13:20.175 --> 13:23.928
Ooh! This is very bad,
this is classic me bad!

13:23.929 --> 13:25.846
I've just really blown this!

13:25.847 --> 13:28.182
How did you get where you are?

13:28.183 --> 13:29.767
I kept thinking
about the stupid prophecy,

13:29.768 --> 13:31.352
and how you said I needed
to take more control,

13:31.353 --> 13:32.436
do things for myself.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.771
So I thought, "Yes! I will!"

13:33.772 --> 13:34.980
Good. Okay.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.315
<i>Panto said
he came from the house.</i>

13:36.316 --> 13:39.068
The house is clearly a thing,

13:39.069 --> 13:40.945
so I borrowed Hobbs' bike.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.446
But that was my first mistake.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.572
<i>It took nearly two hours
to ride over here--</i>

13:43.573 --> 13:44.908
Okay, Dirk, focus.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.369
I found a boarded-up closet upstairs,

13:48.370 --> 13:50.037
and then I fell down a hole
with a slide in it.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.872
A slide?

13:51.873 --> 13:53.040
Let's not get bogged down
in the details, please!

13:53.041 --> 13:54.208
Hold on.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.251
Talk to him for a second.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.586
He thinks he's in hell.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.005
That's a turn of events.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.423
Howdy, Dirk. Hobbs here.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.634
<i>Hello, Sheriff.</i>

14:08.431 --> 14:09.807
Tell him I found the slide!

14:09.808 --> 14:10.891
He says he found the slide.

14:10.892 --> 14:11.809
<i>Wait, uh, what slide?</i>

14:11.810 --> 14:13.352
Tell him not to fall in.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.728
Okay. He says
careful not to fall in!

14:14.729 --> 14:16.689
What, uh, what is this slide?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.190
Ask him if he can climb back up!

14:18.191 --> 14:19.817
Todd wants to know
if you can climb back up.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.236
No! I fell down the slide,
into a room,

14:22.237 --> 14:24.196
and when I looked up,
the slide was gone!

14:24.197 --> 14:26.282
Okay, that's a hard "no" on the slide!

14:26.283 --> 14:28.868
But what is the slide exactly?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.786
What-- can you give me
some information on the slide.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.038
<i>I'm gonna need to know
what the slide is</i>--

14:33.039 --> 14:35.207
What was that?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.543
Did you hear that?

14:36.918 --> 14:38.669
Hear what?

14:40.005 --> 14:42.423
That thumping sound.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.842
Music?

14:44.926 --> 14:46.260
No.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.803
Hobbs!

14:47.804 --> 14:49.681
We're gonna need a ladder,
or a rope, or something.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.099
Oh, I don't think I'm alone in here.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.894
He thinks there's someone else
in there with him.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.978
What, like a person?

14:55.979 --> 14:57.813
No, I don't think so.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.231
Does he want me
to slide down the slide?

14:59.232 --> 15:01.025
Do you want Todd
to slide down the slide?

15:01.026 --> 15:02.776
No, I-I really don't think
that would--

15:02.777 --> 15:04.445
Dirk, it's me. I don't know
how to help you from here.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.988
- Stay where you are.
- You asked me to help.

15:05.989 --> 15:06.990
No!

15:07.657 --> 15:09.116
That was a mistake.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.118
I'm actually fine and great.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.202
<i>Dirk...</i>

15:12.203 --> 15:14.788
No, look, what I was
going to say was this is on me.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.790
I don't even know if there is
a way out of here.

15:16.791 --> 15:17.833
The last thing I want

15:17.834 --> 15:19.752
is you getting
trapped in here with me.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.837
You have to be inside
the house somewhere.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.089
What are you gonna do?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.759
Keep looking for a way out.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.059
Of course.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.938
My family, the Dengdamors,

15:38.939 --> 15:40.648
led by my mother, Lady Frija,

15:40.649 --> 15:42.775
and my brother, Baron Prince Silas,

15:42.776 --> 15:44.361
are the richest folk in all of Inglenook.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.155
Why'd these guys
put you in a cage, then?

15:48.156 --> 15:50.157
These men are in service
to The Mage Kellum,

15:50.158 --> 15:52.868
an evil Wizard who plans
to further incite the feud

15:52.869 --> 15:55.162
between my family and the Trosts.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.956
The "Trosts"?

15:56.957 --> 15:57.998
Farming folk.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.583
Protectors of the woods,

15:59.584 --> 16:02.962
but my family has always thought
they're just dirt diggers.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.589
I got so sick of the fighting
that I ran away.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.508
I was on my way
to find the Forest Witch,

16:07.509 --> 16:09.551
Wakti Wapnasi,

16:09.552 --> 16:12.805
of the Santi Santiga
who guides the Bofuki Nepoo.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.903
Continue.

16:27.904 --> 16:31.407
Wakti Wapnasi
foretold the prophecy to save Wendimoor,

16:31.408 --> 16:34.076
and that means stopping The Mage,

16:34.077 --> 16:36.370
even with his massive army,

16:36.371 --> 16:37.830
the Kellum Knights.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.666
He has conquered every kingdom,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.835
and is marching on Inglenook,

16:42.836 --> 16:45.421
the only place
he hasn't conquered.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.631
This is great,
you're saying all kinds of stuff.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.718
What happened,
you get the Wendigo?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.429
That is why I came to this world.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.349
If I don't fulfill the prophecy
to save Wendimoor,

16:57.475 --> 17:01.145
I believe it ends
in great death and disaster.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.856
Wakti Wapnasi knows
a great many things.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.066
I wanted to ask her of the prophecy,

17:06.067 --> 17:08.444
ask her how to heal the feud
between our families

17:08.445 --> 17:10.989
before The Mage uses it
to destroy us all.

17:12.741 --> 17:14.533
I should've never run away.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.828
When Farson went missing,
the Dengdamors blamed my family

17:17.829 --> 17:19.998
and came after me to seek revenge.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.375
But I managed to get away,

17:23.376 --> 17:26.003
and, with Wakti's help,
came to this world

17:26.004 --> 17:28.630
to search for the great man,

17:28.631 --> 17:30.215
Dirk Gently.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.510
Yeah, I was doing that for a while too.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.680
Didn't turn out great for me.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.853
This place is way bigger
than the Cardenas house, Todd.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.313
<i>Tell us what you see.</i>

17:44.314 --> 17:47.984
It's really weird
and interesting in here.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.152
There has to be a way out.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.404
Just keep looking.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.243
Also, something's following me.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.495
Can you see who it is?

17:59.496 --> 18:01.498
I'd really rather not, actually.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.422
It ain't like Carol
to go off unannounced.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.799
Sometimes she'll go visit her mother.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.384
<i>She lives in one of them
retirement homes out in Anaconda.</i>

18:14.385 --> 18:17.347
<i>But she'd leave a note, you know?</i>

18:18.848 --> 18:21.809
<i>This is real strange, ain't it?</i>

18:21.810 --> 18:25.605
<i>I mean, why would she leave
her jewelry behind in a pile of sand?</i>

18:25.980 --> 18:27.524
- N'uh-uh!
- N'uh-uh...

18:28.691 --> 18:31.443
Uh, this is Jeanette
McGrady's watch.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.778
I'd know that thing anywhere.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.029
Well, I spoke with Buster,

18:34.030 --> 18:35.614
and Jeanette
ain't been home either.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.866
It's like the whole damn book club
just up and run off.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.202
How many people
in this book club?

18:40.203 --> 18:42.412
<i>There's, uh... four.</i>

18:42.413 --> 18:46.250
Look, I'm not usually one to, uh,
get my shorts in a bunch,

18:46.251 --> 18:48.836
<i>but this just smells
like foul play to me,</i>

18:48.837 --> 18:50.462
<i>and if anything's
happened to my Carol,</i>

18:50.463 --> 18:52.131
I just don't know what I'll do.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.591
I think something
definitely did happen.

18:54.551 --> 18:55.509
Who are you again?

18:55.510 --> 18:57.094
Uh! Sh-she's cool, man.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.555
Jasper, look, I'm gonna ask you to, uh,

18:59.556 --> 19:02.432
to not touch any of this

19:02.433 --> 19:04.309
for the time being.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.145
- Hot crime scene!
- All right.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.730
There are five wine glasses.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.441
There are only four piles of sand.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.740
He's gotta be somewhere
in here, right?

19:18.741 --> 19:19.741
Like, maybe underneath us?

19:19.742 --> 19:20.701
Like underground?

19:20.702 --> 19:21.994
No, I don't think so.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.036
<i>Hey, Hobbs!</i>

19:23.037 --> 19:24.580
Yeah, go, Tina.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.875
Dirk, where are you right now?

19:28.418 --> 19:29.376
Dirk?

19:29.377 --> 19:31.170
- I...
<i>- Hello?</i>

19:31.171 --> 19:34.631
I think I can hear
someone talking.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.467
Hang on, Todd.

19:41.806 --> 19:45.601
<i>...those who are wise
will turn back now.</i>

19:45.602 --> 19:48.562
<i>We'll be ready for 'em.</i>

19:48.563 --> 19:51.732
<i>Beware the secret of the vault.</i>

19:51.733 --> 19:53.775
<i>You have this worm-eaten...</i>

19:53.776 --> 19:55.485
<i>Heroes and...</i>

20:02.202 --> 20:04.578
<i>I heard strange noises in the woods.</i>

20:04.579 --> 20:05.997
<i>Weird creatures.</i>

20:08.291 --> 20:09.416
A clue.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.918
What is? What's a clue?

20:10.919 --> 20:12.294
There's, um,...

20:12.295 --> 20:15.505
a thing in this house
that isn't in the real house.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.840
I mean, there's loads of things
in this house

20:16.841 --> 20:17.925
that aren't in the real house,

20:17.926 --> 20:21.261
but this is... a thing.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.138
Oh, man, Tina's got
some holistic going on too!

20:23.139 --> 20:25.140
She says people are missing.
This is spiraling out of control.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.934
Todd?

20:26.935 --> 20:29.187
Whatever that sound is,
it's getting closer.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.563
What if it's the boy
we're looking for?

20:33.483 --> 20:34.650
Eh...

20:34.651 --> 20:35.901
Seriously, Dirk, think about it.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.277
What if the boy we're looking for

20:37.278 --> 20:39.196
slid down that slide years ago,

20:39.197 --> 20:40.822
and got trapped
wherever you are?

20:40.823 --> 20:42.741
What if this is exactly
what's supposed to happen

20:42.742 --> 20:43.784
for you to find him?

20:43.785 --> 20:45.285
Shit.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.870
You're right...

20:48.248 --> 20:50.666
I have to look.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.054
I'm just throwing this out there,

21:46.055 --> 21:48.140
those ladies got turned into dust,
didn't they?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.975
Incinerated or something, yes.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.101
But no.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.145
No, we shouldn't be
jumping to conclusions.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.896
Well, have you seen
anything like this before?

21:54.897 --> 21:58.859
I've seen some...
pretty weird things since I met Dirk,

21:58.860 --> 21:59.818
but I'd like to believe

21:59.819 --> 22:01.738
there's still a rational
explanation for this.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.322
So...

22:03.323 --> 22:05.825
Who would be the fifth member
of this book club?

22:08.328 --> 22:10.287
Oh, man. Oh, man.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.621
Suzie Boreton knows
all those women.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.374
She's been in a feud with them
or something, has been for years.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.751
Hold on,

22:15.752 --> 22:17.919
this is the same Suzie
who Bart said attacked her?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.880
And whose husband
attacked Todd and Dirk?

22:19.881 --> 22:21.298
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

22:21.299 --> 22:23.008
Okay, well, then,
I think perhaps we should--

22:23.009 --> 22:24.134
Yeah!

22:24.135 --> 22:26.596
Stay on the road.
Stay on the road, Tina!

24:09.157 --> 24:13.535
There's a table that's been stabbed
by a pair of scissors,

24:13.536 --> 24:16.580
and it's bleeding everywhere,

24:16.581 --> 24:20.959
and I mean all that
in a horribly literal way.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.627
- Scissors?
- Yes!

24:27.300 --> 24:30.470
For the record, this is not
the best case ever anymore.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.025
and we're not part of the...

24:45.026 --> 24:47.361
Shut up, witchakookoo!

24:48.529 --> 24:50.322
Where are you going?

24:50.323 --> 24:52.032
Hey, don't leave!

24:52.033 --> 24:53.283

Hey!

24:59.957 --> 25:02.334
Not... now!

25:02.335 --> 25:03.752
What's happening?

25:03.753 --> 25:04.669
Dirk, what's happening?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.172
Not good things!

Wait, what? Are you sure?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.308
Yes!

Oh! Oh!

26:03.896 --> 26:04.938
Well, I think--

26:05.815 --> 26:08.108
Hang on! Hang on!

26:08.109 --> 26:09.943
No, no, wait!

26:09.944 --> 26:11.069
We can't go out there, Todd!

26:11.070 --> 26:12.195
It's better than here!

26:12.196 --> 26:14.281
No, it's not, Todd!
It's nothing! Only static!

What if we don't have an--

26:25.960 --> 26:27.419
Oh, we're back in reality.

26:28.671 --> 26:29.588
Todd, you were right.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.381
You--

26:31.382 --> 26:32.757
What's wrong?

26:32.758 --> 26:34.301
Vogel!

26:34.302 --> 26:35.678
Help me!

26:49.900 --> 26:51.193

Todd...?

27:01.078 --> 27:02.120
Todd!

27:02.121 --> 27:03.748
But that's impossible.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.294
Todd...?

27:09.337 --> 27:10.253
Amanda!

27:14.091 --> 27:15.134
Todd?

27:23.142 --> 27:24.185
Todd?

27:25.269 --> 27:26.520
Todd!

27:30.441 --> 27:31.691
You lied.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.943
You are a witchakookoo.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.655
You had tiny lights
all over you.

27:38.366 --> 27:39.824
You saw that?

27:39.825 --> 27:41.744
You're both magic.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.539
Todd! Todd!

27:45.748 --> 27:46.749
Hobbs!

27:47.958 --> 27:48.833
Hobbs!

27:48.834 --> 27:49.751
Todd!

27:49.752 --> 27:50.835
What's happening?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.504
Where are his pills?
He needs his pills!

27:52.505 --> 27:53.714
Where are they?

27:57.385 --> 27:58.885
This is incredible.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.303
Bart is just the beginning.

28:00.304 --> 28:03.264
These people are more powerful
than I imagined.

28:03.265 --> 28:04.808
You are in way over your head.

28:04.809 --> 28:08.978
Yes, I know.
But what am I supposed to do?

28:10.064 --> 28:11.940
Well, you can't just
keep them locked up

28:11.941 --> 28:13.692
and expect them
to do what you want.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.860
I mean, these people,

28:15.861 --> 28:17.529
these things,

28:17.530 --> 28:19.572
or whatever they are,

28:19.573 --> 28:21.908
they want meaning.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.620
Look, in computer science,
we call it a Causal Role.

28:25.996 --> 28:27.581
What are you talking about?

28:28.582 --> 28:30.584
I know how to get them
to do what you want.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.295
But...

28:34.296 --> 28:36.006
so do you have powers
or not?

28:37.299 --> 28:39.259
I can help you.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.677
But you have to let me.

28:40.678 --> 28:43.221
And that means
letting me out of here.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.808
Because right now,
as far as I can see,

28:46.809 --> 28:48.519
I'm the only one on your side.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.855
Are you okay?

28:51.856 --> 28:52.772
So, um...

28:52.773 --> 28:54.274
What...

28:54.275 --> 28:56.484
What happened
to you guys?

29:00.364 --> 29:01.824
Pbbbbt.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.162
I brought you a gift.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.291
What is this?

29:11.292 --> 29:13.543
I think
it's the murder weapon.

29:13.544 --> 29:14.545
Right.

29:15.755 --> 29:16.756
Right...

29:18.299 --> 29:19.257
What?

29:21.177 --> 29:22.511
Sheriff's Department, open up!

29:35.858 --> 29:37.358
- Maybe she's at work.
- Or missing?

29:37.359 --> 29:38.860
Or a pile of dust.

29:38.861 --> 29:40.111
We could break in.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.156
Illegal without a warrant, I know.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.242
Wait, are you down for that?

29:46.243 --> 29:49.579
Technically,
I'm already a criminal, so...

29:49.580 --> 29:50.663
Yup, just give me a hair pin,

29:50.664 --> 29:51.748
and I'll pick this lock no problem.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.374
Shh...

29:53.375 --> 29:55.627
Is that really
what you want, Suzie?

29:55.628 --> 29:58.797
You want them to come in here
and save you?

30:02.051 --> 30:02.967
Yello!

30:02.968 --> 30:04.719
I mean--
Tevetino.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.637
Oh, hey, Hobbs.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.305
<i>Yeah, we're at
the Boreton residence.</i>

30:07.306 --> 30:09.099
<i>She doesn't seem
to be home, but...</i>

30:10.142 --> 30:12.519
Hobbs said the Cardenas house
is haunted by a purple alligator

30:12.520 --> 30:15.356
and they found what might be
the murder weapon used to kill Hector.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.442
<i>That Dirk Gently
is really somethin'!</i>

30:19.443 --> 30:21.820
Okay, I'm sorry, what?

30:21.821 --> 30:24.031
Where?
I searched that whole house.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.574
Okay, we'll be right there.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.161
Hobbs wants us to meet him
back at the station.

30:30.371 --> 30:31.830
What about Suzie Boreton?

30:31.831 --> 30:33.122
We'll be back, man!

30:33.123 --> 30:36.126
Come on, I wanna see
a dang purple alligator!

30:37.086 --> 30:39.046
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

30:58.357 --> 31:00.358
You're right.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.320
This is most likely
the murder weapon.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.573
But this looks new.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.117
This is fresh blood.

31:08.617 --> 31:09.576
These scissors,

31:09.577 --> 31:12.579
could they be connected
to the scissor sword somehow, right?

31:12.580 --> 31:13.705
Panto Trost?

31:13.706 --> 31:15.415
Screw Wendiwhatever.
What about real life?

31:15.416 --> 31:16.708
Four missing women

31:16.709 --> 31:18.543
who were last seen
at a super dusty book club.

31:18.544 --> 31:19.878
A tree with a body in it,

31:19.879 --> 31:21.170
a car in a tree with a body in it.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.297
Then you got this impossible gun

31:22.298 --> 31:24.674
that somehow shoots air,
despite having no moving parts?

31:24.675 --> 31:25.967
A house inside another house

31:25.968 --> 31:27.302
with the murder weapon
hidden inside it?

31:27.303 --> 31:28.219
Not to mention

31:28.220 --> 31:29.345
some kind of purple people eater,

31:29.346 --> 31:30.847
'cause that's what that was.

31:30.848 --> 31:31.849
Yeah.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.309
What?

31:34.310 --> 31:35.435
Why are you all
looking at me?

31:35.436 --> 31:37.228
Keep going round in a circle.
Farah, your turn.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.146
Well, no, come on.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.064
It all has to
add up to something.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.734
Everything is connected, right?

31:42.735 --> 31:46.029
Bart being here isn't
a coincidence, it can't be.

31:46.030 --> 31:48.323
Well, yes, yes, of course...

31:48.324 --> 31:49.490
Wait, no,

31:49.491 --> 31:51.659
a guy with pink hair

31:51.660 --> 31:53.077
who claims to be a prince

31:53.078 --> 31:55.288
from a far-away land
called Wendimoor

31:55.289 --> 31:58.666
where you, Dirk Gently,
are at the center of a prophecy.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.834
It's connected.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.210
Yeah! Yes!

32:01.211 --> 32:03.212
Yes, well, obviously the...

32:03.213 --> 32:06.175
It... And then, that, and...

32:12.181 --> 32:13.890
Sorry.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.447
This again?

32:38.457 --> 32:40.124
Look...

32:40.125 --> 32:41.793
Dirk, I'm sorry.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.711
I didn't mean
to put pressure on you.

32:43.712 --> 32:45.129
I know that's not how you work,

32:45.130 --> 32:48.049
or... how it works, whatever it is.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.759
What if that monster ate us?

32:49.760 --> 32:51.260
It didn't.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.304
What if diving through
that static didn't work,

32:53.305 --> 32:54.931
what if that just killed us?

32:54.932 --> 32:56.474
It did work, it didn't kill us.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.268
I couldn't even help you when you
were having a pararibulitis attack.

32:59.269 --> 33:00.436
Well, I don't think anyone could.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.814
All I ever wanted was a friend,

33:02.815 --> 33:04.816
to have someone
who believed in me.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.150
And now you have one.
More than one--

33:06.151 --> 33:09.530
And what if who and what I am
is going to get you killed?

33:12.574 --> 33:15.118
I don't know
what this all means.

33:15.119 --> 33:17.829
I never know how things connect
until they do,

33:17.830 --> 33:19.372
and usually before then,

33:19.373 --> 33:22.542
it's just danger and death.

33:22.543 --> 33:23.710
Why are you here?

33:23.711 --> 33:26.629
What have you got to do
with any of this?

33:26.630 --> 33:27.631
I...

33:33.012 --> 33:34.513
I saw Amanda.

33:35.389 --> 33:36.597
What?

33:36.598 --> 33:38.975
I had like a hallucination

33:38.976 --> 33:40.101
when I was having my attack.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.436
Like Amanda's visions?

33:41.437 --> 33:43.104
No, no, no, it was like...

33:43.105 --> 33:44.939
she was having it for me.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.858
Like, reaching out.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.360
I saw her.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.403
I saw her.

33:50.404 --> 33:53.156
Dirk, as crazy as it sounds,

33:53.157 --> 33:54.867
I think Amanda's in danger...

33:55.868 --> 33:57.286
in Wendimoor.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.250
Oh!

34:04.251 --> 34:05.543
Ha!

34:05.544 --> 34:07.837
We have to go back
to the Cardenas house.

34:07.838 --> 34:08.880
Why?

34:08.881 --> 34:10.339
And...

34:10.340 --> 34:12.009
we need to take Panto.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.181
Vogel?

34:18.182 --> 34:19.891
Can you hear me?

34:37.159 --> 34:38.618
Lord Triangle Badevil,

34:38.619 --> 34:39.952
Hail to The Mage!

34:39.953 --> 34:41.413
Hail to The Mage.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.457
Hail to The Mage.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.460
I've come for the Dengdamor boy.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.795
We have other prisoners:

34:48.796 --> 34:51.089
a boogle we caught
trying to steal our food,

34:51.090 --> 34:53.008
and two travelers
from another land.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.218
Only the boy matters.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.720
What do we do with rest of them?

34:59.473 --> 35:00.641
Kill them.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.022
Hurry up, will you?

35:08.023 --> 35:10.983
While there's still
sand in the glass, you fools.

35:10.984 --> 35:12.444
Let him go!

35:28.961 --> 35:30.129
Wait!

35:34.049 --> 35:36.300
I'm so sorry.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.678
I couldn't save you.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.267
Shut her up.

35:44.268 --> 35:45.393
I will keep you quiet...

35:48.188 --> 35:49.982
It cannot be...

35:50.149 --> 35:52.150
She's glowing.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.861
She is a bloody witch!

36:16.717 --> 36:17.842
See, I knew it!

36:19.094 --> 36:20.888
Vogel, lunch!

36:35.068 --> 36:36.485
Drummer!

36:38.405 --> 36:40.157
Come on, come on!

36:41.783 --> 36:43.910
Come on, Farson, let's go.

36:43.911 --> 36:44.912
Now!

36:53.378 --> 36:54.379
Wait.

36:56.173 --> 36:58.633
You're letting her go? Why?

36:58.634 --> 37:00.427
We can't just leave her to die.

37:04.431 --> 37:05.432
This way!

37:19.029 --> 37:22.114
You said you fell into a room,
Prince Trost. Is this it?

37:22.115 --> 37:23.158
Yes.

37:23.325 --> 37:27.245
And you fell onto a bed
that then disappeared.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.288
Yes.

37:36.630 --> 37:37.630
Ah ha ha!

37:37.631 --> 37:39.257
Well, I'll be
a monkey's uncle.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.341
It's a Murphy bed.

37:40.342 --> 37:41.384
Flush with the wall.

37:41.385 --> 37:42.802
But in the house within the house,

37:42.803 --> 37:44.263
the bed was down.

37:45.347 --> 37:48.933
Is this how you came
through to our world?

37:48.934 --> 37:50.477
This is where I fell.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.354
Looks like water damage.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.898
Where? What do you got?

38:01.530 --> 38:02.697
I don't get it.

38:02.698 --> 38:03.906
It's a solid wall.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.242
How did you come through?

38:10.539 --> 38:11.707
Oh...

38:14.001 --> 38:15.252
Guys?

38:17.963 --> 38:19.297
A little help over here.

38:44.614 --> 38:46.199
What is this?

38:50.537 --> 38:51.747
Home.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.216
<i>I come from a place
far away from here,</i>

39:04.217 --> 39:09.180
a beautiful, perfect place
called Wendimoor,

39:09.181 --> 39:10.848
that I rule unopposed

39:10.849 --> 39:13.976
<i>as the most powerful
wizard ever to exist.</i>

39:13.977 --> 39:16.729
<i>You see, Suzie, there's
no point in fighting me.</i>

39:16.730 --> 39:18.564
You can't win.

39:18.565 --> 39:23.235
I believe a lie has been told
about my world, Suzanne Boreton.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.780
<i>A lie in the form of a prophecy</i>

39:25.781 --> 39:28.324
that has been
kept secret from me.

39:28.325 --> 39:29.867
A lie that states

39:29.868 --> 39:32.954
that someone could end my reign.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.875
I created the second wand

39:38.794 --> 39:40.836
because I needed a partner

39:40.837 --> 39:46.175
to help me
uncover this prophecy...

39:46.176 --> 39:48.719
and destroy it.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.763
I just wanna leave Bergsberg.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.515
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

39:52.516 --> 39:54.142
Don't you, though, Suzanne?

39:55.685 --> 39:57.603
I didn't mean
to get drawn into all this.

39:57.604 --> 39:58.939
I just...

39:59.981 --> 40:01.399
I'm a nice person.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.692
No, you're not!

40:03.902 --> 40:08.197
No... you're... not.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.741
The wand wasn't drawn to you
because you're nice.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.034
You're far better than nice.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.829
You're interesting.

40:14.830 --> 40:15.831
Hmm.

40:17.374 --> 40:25.214
Nice people will conspire against you
to stop you having what you want...

40:25.215 --> 40:27.049
Power.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.968
Freedom.

40:28.969 --> 40:30.010
Join me,

40:30.011 --> 40:34.641
and you can leave this wretched place
and be a queen.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.270
No one telling you
what to do anymore.

40:39.271 --> 40:41.355
As long as you hold the wand,

40:41.356 --> 40:43.649
you will be invincible.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.401
Glorious.

40:45.402 --> 40:46.903
Perfect.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.948
Do you want them
to take that away from you?

40:50.949 --> 40:51.992
No.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.956
No, I'm never going back
to the way things were.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.129
What do you want me to do?

41:05.630 --> 41:09.509
I need you to kill Dirk Gently.
