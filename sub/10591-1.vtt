03:36.049 --> 03:39.212
You've sold us a bill of goods,
Gordon.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.946
Promised new drugs to fight everything
from the common cold to cancer.

03:43.122 --> 03:47.991
- We'll deliver everything we promised.
- I'm sorry, but the adventure is over.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.622
We're exercising our option
to liquidate...

03:51.798 --> 03:54.028
...Byron & Mitchell Research Limited.

03:55.802 --> 03:59.329
Jack, show these people how filthy
rich we're gonna make them, please.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.905
I don't think you understand
what I just said.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.275
Oh, I think I understand.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.211
Jack.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.646
Perrinia immortalis.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.287
The Blood Orchid.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.685
First described in 1892
by Houghton...

04:17.857 --> 04:22.191
...the last person to see it until our
team brought a sample from Borneo.

04:23.129 --> 04:26.428
It lies dormant for seven years,
then blooms for just six months.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.432
Which means we just got
lucky as hell, gentlemen.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.765
Anyone here familiar
with the Hayflick limit?

04:32.939 --> 04:35.703
He proposed a cell
could only replicate 56 times...

04:35.875 --> 04:37.866
...before it died from
a buildup of toxins.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.369
According to him,
it's the reason we die.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.878
But what if we could
transcend that limit?

04:43.650 --> 04:44.947
That would be impossible.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.310
Not according to our data.

04:47.487 --> 04:51.446
Our research indicates the presence
of a chemical in Perrinia immortalis...

04:51.624 --> 04:54.024
...that can significantly
prolong cellular life.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.221
I can't support this.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.061
Does that mean
what I think it means?

05:00.033 --> 05:03.230
Are we talking about
a pharmaceutical equivalent...

05:03.403 --> 05:04.836
...to the fountain of youth?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.367
Exactly.

05:08.341 --> 05:09.968
That'd be bigger than Viagra.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.474
- Have you put this into human trials?
- We can't yet.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.309
Our sample was degraded
in the initial study.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.747
We need more of the orchid.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.114
See, and that's our only problem,
gentlemen.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.813
That orchid is only in bloom
for another two weeks.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.089
Well, what the hell
are you waiting for?

05:32.665 --> 05:34.826
Get your asses down to Borneo.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.604
Yes.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.604
- Welcome to Borneo.
- Thanks.

06:16.409 --> 06:20.573
- What's wrong with this picture?
- I don't know. Let me see, you're in it?

06:20.747 --> 06:22.112
We don't have a boat, okay?

06:22.281 --> 06:24.681
Your company had one responsibility:
Get a boat.

06:24.851 --> 06:28.548
- And you've already screwed it up.
- Wait. Your girl chartered the boat.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.815
Sam confirmed with the company.
They're waiting for your payment.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.618
Hey. Hey, I've got something.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.588
Payment cleared.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.427
Really?

06:38.631 --> 06:40.895
- Where's the boat?
- It's not coming.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.629
All of the charter companies
have shut down.

06:43.803 --> 06:46.670
No one'll risk going upriver
till after the rainy season.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.672
- And when's that?
- Two, three weeks.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.005
The orchid's only in bloom
for one more week, tops.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.576
There's a local captain
named Jin-Soon.

06:55.848 --> 06:59.716
I'm told he'll take anyone upriver,
for the right price.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.035
Are you sure this is the place?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.036
They said the one
with the red door.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.972
I bet you somebody's playing
Russian roulette in there.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.612
Maybe we'll get lucky
and you'll get a turn.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.011
Hey, why don't you two just get a room.
Come on, Sam.

07:45.665 --> 07:46.893
Wait here.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.590
Yeah, if you insist.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.363
Hey! Hey!

07:52.038 --> 07:53.300
Jin-Soon.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.012
Jin-Soon?

08:24.470 --> 08:26.165
Your Indonesian sucks.

08:26.539 --> 08:30.441
- Stick to English.
- We heard you could take us upriver.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.339
In rainy season?

08:33.645 --> 08:35.375
Won't be cheap.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.448
We can pay you 25,000.

08:40.285 --> 08:43.380
- I'll have a talk with the captain.
- You're not the captain?

08:43.856 --> 08:45.380
Jin-Soon!

08:48.394 --> 08:52.262
These tourists need a boat.
I told them not in the rainy season.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.861
- You're Jin-Soon?
- Local nickname.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.630
Name's Johnson. Bill Johnson.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.432
It's a pronunciation thing.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.105
And you can rent my boat
for 25 grand.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.303
Now, you want me to drive it,
well...

09:07.480 --> 09:09.072
...that'll cost you 50.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.739
Fifty grand? Are you high?

09:11.918 --> 09:13.545
You know what?
Don't answer that.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.812
I'm not trusting him
with the expedition.

09:15.988 --> 09:20.084
Listen. Lady.
Let's cut the bullshit, please.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.092
If one of the other charter
companies could take you...

09:23.262 --> 09:25.457
...you'd be on the river by now.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.293
You only came to me
because you're desperate.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.436
Fifty grand's my price.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.071
Take it...

09:33.239 --> 09:34.763
...or leave it.

10:03.469 --> 10:06.632
I've seen subway cars
in better shape than this.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.170
Yeah, she may be ugly...

10:09.342 --> 10:11.071
...but she puts out.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.549
- Shit!
- What took you so long?

10:24.724 --> 10:27.921
Hey, you try getting a GPS locator,
a Sat-Nav EchoStar...

10:28.094 --> 10:30.528
...and a UV spectrometer
past Indonesian customs.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.391
- Complaining already.
- Yeah.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.227
- You rather be back in the office?
- Hell, yeah.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.892
I had courtside seats
at the Garden on Saturday.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.732
I was gonna sit right between
Spike and Woody.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.505
Oh, man, is that our ride?!

10:43.676 --> 10:46.804
Look at the bright side, Cole.
At least the weather's nice.

10:49.281 --> 10:52.273
Ben Douglas, team doctor.
You must be Sam.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.180
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.048
Glad to have you aboard.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.252
I'm gonna get you for this.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.518
Oh, yeah. This could be fun.

11:03.696 --> 11:05.357
You can forget about that, dog.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.931
That's one car you ain't
never gonna catch.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.931
There's always a way.

11:10.469 --> 11:14.269
- Your team's a little green, huh?
- My former grad students.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.998
Best in their field.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.400
Here's a tip for Wexell-Hall:

11:18.778 --> 11:20.746
You want the best young talent...

11:20.913 --> 11:22.278
...recruit early.

11:23.315 --> 11:26.512
Yes, I'm sure Sam's very talented.

11:30.589 --> 11:32.454
I think I resent that.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.086
You and the other gal can stay in here.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.523
You live here.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.727
The way you say that,
I can tell you're impressed.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.236
All right.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.635
If you need anything...

11:48.808 --> 11:50.173
Well...

11:50.342 --> 11:53.072
...if you need anything,
you're shit out of luck.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.476
Okay.

12:28.514 --> 12:32.006
Now, this is where the exploratory
team found the orchid.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.583
In the Selatan Basin.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.278
- It took them three days to get upriver.
- Yeah.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.150
That was before
the rainy season.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.717
These waterways
could be dangerous now.

12:40.893 --> 12:44.056
- You said you'd get us there safely.
- And I will.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.698
But safe isn't always quick.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.027
We'll work our way up
one bend at a time.

12:49.201 --> 12:52.466
If I don't like what I see,
we change course.

12:52.638 --> 12:55.129
Can't chart the fastest route
before you begin.

12:55.307 --> 12:56.740
Already have.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.603
Check it. All right.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.147
Now, we're uplinked in real time
to NASA and AsiaSatCom.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.341
Now, under ideal conditions...

13:06.519 --> 13:08.487
...this is the fastest route.

13:08.654 --> 13:12.146
But once we superimpose weather
patterns for the past 10 years...

13:12.324 --> 13:14.690
...and then extrapolate...

13:16.796 --> 13:20.163
Bingo! It's Padrang
to the Selatan Basin.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.364
I'm a bad man.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.434
We got less than a week
to get to that orchid.

13:26.605 --> 13:29.301
If you can't get the job done,
give our money back...

13:29.475 --> 13:33.275
...and we'll get somebody who can.
- I'll get you there.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.767
God help me.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.824
Something attacked me!

14:55.995 --> 14:58.896
- Oh, my God!
- She said something attacked her.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.095
No, no, no!

15:05.404 --> 15:07.338
It's okay. It's okay.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.736
What the hell'd you do?
You scared him.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.342
I scared him?!

15:12.411 --> 15:14.504
This is Kong.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.614
Kong lives here.

15:16.982 --> 15:19.143
You're guests.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.848
Be nice.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.656
Disgusting animal.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.822
You okay now?

15:31.330 --> 15:34.822
I'm fine. Just keep
your hands off of me.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.265
Oh, yeah. Well, it's gonna be tough,
but I'll try.

15:50.182 --> 15:53.345
No, no, the S-1 has to be on file
before the week is out.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.919
- That's the whole point.
- Hello?

15:56.088 --> 16:00.320
- The S-1 needs to be on file before...
- Yes, we were able to get on the river.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.188
That's the purpose. We need
the comments from the SEC.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.990
- Excuse me.
- It's the only place I can get reception.

16:06.165 --> 16:09.191
- No, just get it done. Be ready to go...
- No, that's impossible...

16:09.368 --> 16:12.360
- Hello? Hello? Damn!
- Hello? Bob? Damn it!

16:13.572 --> 16:15.062
Try my phone.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.800
Works just as good,
but it's free.

16:18.544 --> 16:23.572
Okay. Maybe you can use my special
antenna to boost your reception.

16:24.016 --> 16:28.146
We're dealing with a lithophytic vine,
so we want to search any rock face.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.345
Now, this ridge here
seems a good bet.

16:30.522 --> 16:31.887
Sam.

16:35.394 --> 16:36.918
Come on, Sam. What do you say?

16:38.030 --> 16:40.760
We're young. We're single.
We're in Borneo.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.531
What do you got to lose?

16:42.701 --> 16:44.828
Not satisfied, walk away.
No commitments.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.001
"No commitments."

16:47.373 --> 16:48.670
That's your pitch?

16:48.841 --> 16:52.208
Did I say "No commitments"?
I meant marry me.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.843
Am I gonna be dealing with this
for the next two weeks?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.276
Yep.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.799
So you were one of Jack's students?

17:14.967 --> 17:18.630
Yeah. He was teaching a seminar
on botanical pharmacology.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.364
Soon as I finished my dissertation,
he hired me.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.633
Well, that's one way to get a leg-up.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.309
What's that supposed to mean?

17:27.479 --> 17:29.470
I had a professor
who wanted to hire me.

17:29.648 --> 17:32.208
Of course, he wanted me
to be his secretary.

17:34.019 --> 17:36.317
Look, if I've done something
to offend you...

17:36.488 --> 17:38.547
No. No, dear, not at all.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.626
Actually, I admire you.
Took me 10 years to get where I am.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.730
Clearly, your generation
has it figured out.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.736
Man, this is good.
Where'd you learn to cook like this?

17:56.909 --> 18:00.345
- Little recipe I picked up in Sri Lanka.
- What were you doing there?

18:00.512 --> 18:02.810
Doctors Without Borders.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.480
It's my day job.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.311
You guys expect to need a doctor?

18:06.485 --> 18:08.953
Can't get the expedition
bonded without one.

18:09.121 --> 18:12.488
Well, you just think of me
as a charming insurance policy.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.029
Hey!

18:20.365 --> 18:21.855
You've had your dinner.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.695
Get out of here.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.767
What'd I say?

18:33.712 --> 18:35.179
There's not that much...

18:35.347 --> 18:38.316
I'm not sleeping up there.
I ain't sleeping on the floor.

18:38.484 --> 18:41.078
I ain't sleeping on no damn...

20:20.719 --> 20:23.984
- Oh, shit. What was that?
- What the hell was that?

20:24.156 --> 20:26.590
- Something's getting eaten.
- By what?

20:27.025 --> 20:29.255
Everything gets eaten out here.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.123
It's the jungle.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.270
Kong.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.475
Hey. You guys seen Kong?

20:46.645 --> 20:48.613
No. Not since last night.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.052
Where are you?

20:55.520 --> 20:57.010
Kong?

20:57.656 --> 21:02.025
We need those results by next month
if we want the FDA off our backs.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.253
Hello? Shit!

21:04.429 --> 21:05.794
I can't hear you!

21:06.431 --> 21:08.228
Can you hear me now?

21:08.400 --> 21:10.493
How about now?

21:10.669 --> 21:12.068
Can you hear me now?

21:12.237 --> 21:14.637
- Can you hear me now?
- We can!

21:14.806 --> 21:16.603
Can you hear me now?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.802
- Gail! Oh, my God.
- Shit.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.439
Stop the boat!

21:36.128 --> 21:37.356
- I'll go.
- All right.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.520
Hey, Gail! Can you hear me now?!

21:39.998 --> 21:41.329
Oh, I'm gonna kill you!

21:42.501 --> 21:44.469
Stroke, Gail, stroke. Come on.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.969
- Watch your back.
- Hey, Gail! How's the water?

21:54.813 --> 21:57.475
Drop the phone.
It's probably holding you back.

21:57.949 --> 21:59.177
- All right.
- Stay calm.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.512
- Stay calm.
- Use your phone for flotation.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.621
All right, come on, Gail.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.755
- You're almost there.
- It's just like a phone.

22:09.695 --> 22:11.128
I got it.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.358
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

22:18.103 --> 22:19.331
Come on! Come on!

22:21.707 --> 22:23.675
- Get out!
- Hurry up!

22:25.043 --> 22:27.034
Hurry up! Hurry up!

22:27.212 --> 22:29.237
- Come on! Come on!
- Gail, grab it.

22:30.415 --> 22:31.882
- Look out!
- Watch out!

22:41.626 --> 22:43.059
Oh, my God.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.755
Get him, Bill! Get him, Bill!
Get him in the eye, man!

22:52.404 --> 22:53.701
Bill?

23:07.386 --> 23:08.614
Where'd he go?

23:09.054 --> 23:11.045
- Where'd he go?!
- Bill!

23:11.223 --> 23:12.690
I don't see him.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.723
- Where's he gone?
- Oh, my God.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.929
Oh, shit, you won.

23:40.051 --> 23:43.020
- You're okay?
- I lost my phone.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.313
Sorry to hear it.

23:51.263 --> 23:55.495
That was either the bravest
or the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.865
It's a fine line.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.647
- Good as new.
- Thanks.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.326
To Gail...

24:23.495 --> 24:26.726
...who knows it's better to eat
than be eaten.

24:27.899 --> 24:29.628
- To Gail.
- Yeah, yeah, baby.

24:30.836 --> 24:33.202
Almost eaten just to find a flower.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.467
- Hardly seems worth it.
- Oh, it's worth it.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.040
I mean, think about it.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.304
A pill that you take every day
for the rest of your life.

24:42.047 --> 24:44.845
Now, even if we charge,
say, a dollar a pop...

24:46.685 --> 24:48.243
...we're billionaires.
- Yeah.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.583
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.
- At $100 a bottle...

24:51.756 --> 24:54.486
...I'll dive in that river
and fight that croc myself.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.423
So how many flowers does it take
to save the world?

25:00.699 --> 25:03.395
Figure 50 orchids will yield
about an ounce of chemical.

25:03.568 --> 25:06.401
You could have a football field
full of those orchids...

25:06.571 --> 25:09.540
...still doesn't mean you can get it
through human trials.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.338
She doesn't even believe in you.

25:12.644 --> 25:14.134
Comes with the territory.

25:14.312 --> 25:16.906
In research,
you've got to go out on a limb.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.947
And there's always someone
waiting to chop it off.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.714
Where the hell have you been?

25:25.223 --> 25:27.191
- Damn that thing!
- Where you been, boy?

25:27.359 --> 25:28.849
Calm down. Calm down.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.892
- Poor guy.
- It's okay. It's all right.

25:31.062 --> 25:32.927
Looks like he's seen a ghost.

25:33.431 --> 25:37.299
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

25:43.308 --> 25:44.866
What if Gail's right?

25:45.944 --> 25:48.572
I mean, cells in a petri dish
are one thing.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.372
- Human trials are another.
- She's wrong.

25:51.983 --> 25:53.974
And when it goes to product...

25:54.152 --> 25:57.178
...and you and I can cash in
our stock options...

25:58.023 --> 26:00.651
...we'll rub her face in it.
- Stock options.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.455
I spoke to Mitchell.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.391
We're each giving you half a point.

26:07.032 --> 26:08.556
I don't know what to say.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.995
Don't say anything.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.396
You deserve it.

26:13.505 --> 26:14.836
All this...

26:15.407 --> 26:18.240
...wouldn't be possible
without your work.

26:22.547 --> 26:23.809
Jack.

26:24.649 --> 26:27.209
Thought we decided against that.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.718
Yeah. Yeah.

26:30.889 --> 26:33.016
You're right.
It would be fun, though.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.453
I mean, here we are,
traveling upriver...

26:36.628 --> 26:38.823
...to the greatest discovery
of our careers.

26:38.997 --> 26:42.455
Now, if this orchid thing
works out, then...

26:42.634 --> 26:43.965
...who knows?

26:44.269 --> 26:45.964
Is that why I'm here?

26:46.137 --> 26:47.968
So you can give us one more try?

26:49.040 --> 26:52.407
You're here because
you're the best researcher I've got.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.477
Am I interrupting something?

26:55.847 --> 26:58.645
No. No, I was...

26:58.817 --> 27:00.444
- I was just going to bed.
- Yeah.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.782
Well, before you do that,
we need to talk.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.866
We got a problem.

27:17.569 --> 27:18.797
See the water level?

27:19.137 --> 27:21.628
In high water,
the Mendranang gets rough.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.297
We could turn around,
try to find another course.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.843
- But that would take at least two days.
- We don't have the time.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.872
If the river becomes impassable,
it'll take a lot longer.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.415
And if we turn back,
then we're definitely screwed.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.817
We're gonna have to risk it.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.082
What if I don't wanna risk it?

27:41.926 --> 27:45.157
Do you have any idea
what this flower means?

27:45.330 --> 27:49.130
We're talking about the biggest
medical discovery in history.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.997
That does sound great, Jack.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.897
But I was never any good at history.

27:56.274 --> 27:58.504
You want me to risk
the Mendranang...

27:58.677 --> 28:00.838
...it'll cost you
an extra 50 thousand.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.548
Done.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.585
Done?

28:10.755 --> 28:13.019
You gotta ask the boss lady
or something?

28:13.191 --> 28:15.091
I'll pay it myself.

28:17.595 --> 28:19.119
All right.

28:19.297 --> 28:20.958
You got yourself a deal.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.360
But if we hit trouble...

28:22.534 --> 28:24.968
...your people do what I say,
you got that?

28:25.637 --> 28:27.400
You're the captain.

28:43.088 --> 28:44.919
Research proposals?

28:46.624 --> 28:48.956
Yeah. Research proposals.

28:50.628 --> 28:52.789
You're not the only company
we're in bed with.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.795
We're the prettiest
and most popular.

28:54.966 --> 28:57.059
Like sleeping with
the head cheerleader.

28:58.203 --> 28:59.500
Not quite.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.263
Come on, you know you love us.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.972
I love your cash.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.372
Then let me
get a look at that file.

29:05.543 --> 29:09.479
After this orchid thing goes bust,
you'll be finished at Wexell-Hall.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.447
Unless you got
something else lined up.

29:12.717 --> 29:15.185
You really wanna see us fail,
don't you?

29:15.787 --> 29:17.015
No.

29:17.188 --> 29:20.749
I just think that you will.
I am a scientist, you know.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.549
Scientist.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.156
What're you doing at Wexell-Hall?

29:25.330 --> 29:27.298
I like science.

29:28.032 --> 29:30.057
I just like money better.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.164
I'll drink to that.

30:16.548 --> 30:19.540
River's flooded.
We can't see the banks.

30:19.717 --> 30:21.344
Miss our turnoff?

30:22.120 --> 30:24.384
It's just ahead.

30:26.191 --> 30:27.590
What the hell was that?

30:31.629 --> 30:33.153
- Rudder's jammed.
- What?

30:33.531 --> 30:34.793
Watch out.

30:37.735 --> 30:38.963
Shit!

30:42.040 --> 30:44.167
Get up! Everybody up!

30:44.342 --> 30:45.604
Hey.

30:54.986 --> 30:56.453
What's going on?

30:56.621 --> 30:58.145
Goddamn it.

30:59.123 --> 31:01.114
Shit! We've blown the head gasket.

31:01.292 --> 31:02.520
Are we all right?

31:02.961 --> 31:04.189
Hey, what's going on?

31:05.763 --> 31:07.822
- What is it?
- We got problems.

31:07.999 --> 31:10.365
- What's wrong, man?
- Bill, wait.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.470
What are you talking about?
What problems?

31:23.281 --> 31:25.806
Son of a bitch.
The current's too strong.

31:40.098 --> 31:43.397
- We missed our turnoff.
- I know. Come on, baby.

31:46.804 --> 31:48.294
Come on, man.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.464
- What is it?
- What is it?

31:55.680 --> 31:57.443
What do you see?

31:57.782 --> 31:59.306
Come on.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.247
You got this. Come on, girl.

32:13.398 --> 32:16.128
- Everybody! Hang on!
- Hang on to what?!

32:19.938 --> 32:21.166
Come on!

32:21.339 --> 32:22.931
Oh, shit!

32:26.844 --> 32:28.175
Holy shit.

33:23.267 --> 33:24.700
It's sinking, it's sinking!

33:25.870 --> 33:28.634
- Where's Cole?
- Swim to the rocks, this way.

33:29.974 --> 33:31.532
Keep going.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.376
- Come on, get to the rocks.
- Get to the rocks.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.780
- Where's Cole? Cole!
- Over there.

33:41.953 --> 33:43.944
Over there! Over there!

33:46.758 --> 33:48.692
Come on, man. Give me your hand!

33:52.597 --> 33:53.962
Come on.

33:55.933 --> 33:57.628
You got it, Sam. Come on.

33:57.802 --> 34:00.430
Give me your hand.
I've got you, I've got you.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.599
Give me your hand,
give me your hand.

34:05.643 --> 34:07.167
Okay, I got her.

34:08.379 --> 34:08.545
You almost got us killed!

34:08.545 --> 34:09.638
You almost got us killed!

34:09.813 --> 34:12.304
You think I wanted this?
I just lost my damn boat!

34:12.483 --> 34:14.348
You'll lose your pay
if you don't get us out.

34:14.518 --> 34:17.716
You said you'd get us there safely.
You should've turned around.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.413
That's enough!

34:20.757 --> 34:23.226
There's nothing
we can do about that now.

34:24.128 --> 34:25.822
It's a waste of energy.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.628
What have we got?

34:30.333 --> 34:36.330
Some specimen jars,
a map, a little water, no food.

34:38.141 --> 34:39.666
Hard drive's ruined.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.074
Well, pretty much
all the equipment's shot.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.449
Except one of the SAT phones
still works. It's on-line.

34:48.619 --> 34:50.587
Thank God, we can call the police.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.350
Police. The nearest river patrol
is back in Padrang.

34:55.226 --> 34:58.093
The only way to get to us
is over that.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.854
Are you saying we're stuck here?

35:04.602 --> 35:06.229
Maybe not.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.432
We're here.
The valley's completely flooded.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.935
But I got a friend who operates
a boat on the Tokut River.

35:13.377 --> 35:17.973
I can give him a call, and he can
meet us here at Naga Rock.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.511
How far is that?

35:20.384 --> 35:23.012
I don't know.
A two-day hike down the river.

35:23.287 --> 35:26.848
But if we bushwhack,
we cut at least a day off the trek.

35:27.024 --> 35:28.924
Oh, my God.
You wanna go through that?

35:29.093 --> 35:30.492
It's the shortest way.

35:30.862 --> 35:33.490
We could be safely in the Tokut
by nightfall.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.959
So we can continue
with the expedition.

35:38.536 --> 35:41.994
- Yeah. I'll get you to the flower.
- I don't care about that flower...

35:42.173 --> 35:44.573
...just get us to safety.
- It's the same thing.

35:45.209 --> 35:48.667
We can either be on my buddy's boat
in 10 hours, or we can sit here...

35:48.846 --> 35:51.406
...and wait for the river patrol
for days.

35:53.017 --> 35:55.781
Your friend. Is he reliable?

35:56.354 --> 35:57.844
Absolutely.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.288
You better not screw me on this.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.484
Sounds like you're already
screwed, mate.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.492
Pay you two grand.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.027
I need you on this one, John.

36:08.199 --> 36:10.394
Yes, yes, so it seems.

36:11.402 --> 36:16.430
Look, Billy, I'd love to help you out,
but I'm flat out, mate, you know.

36:16.741 --> 36:20.575
Probably squeeze you in for,
say, 5 grand?

36:22.213 --> 36:24.078
You're killing me.

36:24.248 --> 36:27.342
That's mates rates.
Or you could always...

36:27.518 --> 36:29.918
...hike back to Padrang
if you wanna save bucks.

36:30.087 --> 36:33.079
- Up to you, pal.
- Fine. Five.

36:33.658 --> 36:35.421
- Yes!
- But you better be there.

36:35.593 --> 36:39.051
Otherwise, I'll tell your wife
about that little trip to Bangkok.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.428
Wife's long gone, Billy.

36:44.435 --> 36:46.164
Long gone, mate.

36:49.106 --> 36:51.870
All right, people, we're on.
Saddle up.

36:52.043 --> 36:57.982
Stay together. This jungle is all green
all the time, and you will get lost.

37:19.370 --> 37:22.066
It's like doing a StairMaster
in a sauna.

37:22.707 --> 37:27.508
Yeah. I might die of a heat stroke,
but I'll have a nice tight ass.

37:28.346 --> 37:30.211
That's the spirit, Cole.

37:33.217 --> 37:36.482
- You want me to grab that?
- Is that a trick question?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.745
Here, man.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.584
Right between Spike and Woody.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.389
Right between Spike and Woody.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.598
You okay, Sam?

37:51.135 --> 37:52.659
I'm fine.

37:57.508 --> 38:01.239
See, a crisis separates
the real men from the pretenders.

38:01.412 --> 38:03.642
Yeah. Can see that.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.308
What, that?

38:08.586 --> 38:10.178
That's nothing.

38:14.992 --> 38:17.358
I tricked him into taking my bag.

38:27.872 --> 38:30.466
Hey. Mind if I give it a try?

38:31.642 --> 38:32.973
Knock yourself out.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.474
Hey.

38:43.187 --> 38:45.155
I'm sorry about your boat.

38:46.457 --> 38:47.947
Yeah, well...

38:49.093 --> 38:51.027
...it was a piece of shit anyway.

39:18.422 --> 39:20.014
Can we go around?

39:21.158 --> 39:24.218
Yeah, we could.
But we'd lose another day.

39:28.299 --> 39:29.561
Let's go.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.070
Shit.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.732
Hey. Knock it off.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.493
- Shit! What was that?
- What was what?

40:38.969 --> 40:41.267
- Something just moved.
- Please don't say that.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.929
I'm serious. Something moved.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.371
"Something just moved"
as in something's alive?

40:45.543 --> 40:48.068
Shit! There it is again.
There's something in here!

40:48.245 --> 40:50.440
There's probably
a million things in here.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.242
He's right. Just keep moving.

41:11.235 --> 41:12.759
Stop it.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.738
I swear to God, if you don't stop it...

41:24.148 --> 41:25.740
Very funny.

41:28.586 --> 41:30.213
Ben?

41:33.924 --> 41:35.551
- Where'd he go?
- Shit!

41:44.735 --> 41:46.362
Help me!

42:02.152 --> 42:03.551
Run!

42:17.268 --> 42:19.361
- What the hell was that thing?!
- Anaconda.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.835
- Oh, great!
- There's snakes out here that big?

42:22.006 --> 42:24.600
- Yes, but...
- But what? It swallowed him whole!

42:24.775 --> 42:27.403
Calm down and listen for a second.
I can explain...

42:27.578 --> 42:30.979
No, you calm down and listen!
Ben was eaten by a freaking snake.

42:31.148 --> 42:33.548
- Okay? A freaking snake!
- Cole.

42:33.717 --> 42:36.515
- Oh, God. Oh, my God. I mean...
- Cole.

42:36.687 --> 42:38.848
Oh, my God, did you see that thing?

42:39.023 --> 42:41.116
We don't got a chance against that!

42:41.292 --> 42:43.624
I mean, Mitchell. Mitchell.
Listen to me, man.

42:43.794 --> 42:47.093
I watch the Discovery Channel.
I'm telling you, we got no chance!

42:47.264 --> 42:49.596
We're like mice in an aquarium.
You understand?

42:49.767 --> 42:52.235
I mean, we're gonna die, girl.
We're gonna die!

42:52.403 --> 42:56.100
Cole, calm down. Okay?

42:57.341 --> 42:59.332
- Okay?
- All right, Jack, I'm okay.

42:59.510 --> 43:00.738
Okay. I'll just...

43:00.911 --> 43:02.276
I'm gonna...

43:02.446 --> 43:05.847
I'm gonna sit right here.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

43:08.185 --> 43:10.619
Listen. Anacondas are territorial.

43:10.788 --> 43:13.416
A snake that size
will hunt a huge area.

43:13.891 --> 43:15.722
There won't be another one
for miles.

43:16.860 --> 43:20.296
We gotta get to the boat.
It's not that far.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.931
So if we keep moving
and stick together...

43:24.969 --> 43:27.460
...we should be fine.
- We should be?!

43:29.373 --> 43:30.635
How big do they get?

43:30.808 --> 43:34.266
That was the biggest one I've ever
seen by far. A freak of nature.

43:34.645 --> 43:37.671
The odds of running into another
that size are astronomical.

43:37.848 --> 43:40.248
Yeah, but how do we know
the one that got Ben...

43:40.417 --> 43:42.510
...is not gonna come after us?

43:42.820 --> 43:44.481
It takes them weeks to digest.

43:45.055 --> 43:48.650
Meal like that,
he'll be sleeping it off for a while.

43:55.766 --> 43:59.793
Let's just get to that boat
and get home.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.631
What about the orchid?

44:03.173 --> 44:04.697
You've gotta be kidding me.

44:04.875 --> 44:06.968
It won't bloom
for another seven years.

44:07.144 --> 44:10.807
- This expedition is over, Jack.
- Now, hold on a second, Gail.

44:11.248 --> 44:14.684
- There's a lot of money at stake here.
- I don't care. Ben is dead!

44:14.852 --> 44:16.217
We have lost someone.

44:17.021 --> 44:20.354
As Wexell-Hall's representative,
I am calling this expedition off.

44:20.524 --> 44:22.822
- You don't have the authority.
- Check your contract.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.858
We're in the middle of the jungle.

44:25.029 --> 44:27.554
At this point, your authority
is what we say it is.

44:33.103 --> 44:36.197
Jack, I'm with her.
I gotta get the hell out of here, man.

44:39.943 --> 44:42.810
Look. Ben was my friend, okay?

44:42.980 --> 44:46.381
I got him into this, and no one
feels worse about it than I do.

44:46.550 --> 44:48.211
I don't wanna do
anything stupid.

44:48.385 --> 44:50.853
I just wanna accomplish
what we came here for.

44:51.021 --> 44:54.115
If we turn back now,
Ben's death would be for nothing.

44:59.763 --> 45:02.197
Let's just get back to the boat.

45:02.499 --> 45:05.798
We can regroup
and make our decision then.

45:08.605 --> 45:10.266
Fine.

45:18.449 --> 45:19.814
Jack.

45:19.983 --> 45:22.850
- Maybe Gail's right.
- She's just scared.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.987
Once we get back to the boat,
she'll be okay.

45:29.660 --> 45:33.790
When we get back to the boat,
this expedition is over.

45:33.964 --> 45:36.228
I'm taking these people to safety.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.958
Hey, hey, hey. We had a deal.

45:38.469 --> 45:41.734
Keep your money, doc.
Someone is dead.

45:41.905 --> 45:43.805
We're officially in over our heads.

45:44.141 --> 45:46.632
You said we wouldn't
run into another one of them.

45:46.810 --> 45:49.643
And we probably won't,
but I can't guarantee it.

45:49.813 --> 45:51.610
So I'll get you to the boat...

45:51.782 --> 45:54.580
...and after that we're done.

45:57.654 --> 46:00.020
Well, that answers it.

46:00.190 --> 46:03.785
That answers nothing. I'll just throw
more money at him at the boat.

46:03.961 --> 46:06.327
If he doesn't take it,
I'll offer his friend the same deal.

46:06.497 --> 46:10.058
- Jack. Maybe we should listen...
- lf we don't get to that orchid now...

46:10.234 --> 46:12.964
...all of our work
will have been for nothing.

46:13.771 --> 46:17.229
I need your support, okay? You have
as much riding on this as I do.

46:17.407 --> 46:19.466
Don't let me down.

46:25.282 --> 46:28.376
I saw this special on Animal Planet.
Anacondas are vicious.

46:28.552 --> 46:30.986
They hunt for sport.
Don't even need to see you.

46:31.155 --> 46:33.282
Just use their tongues
to sense body heat...

46:33.457 --> 46:34.651
Shut the hell up.

46:34.825 --> 46:37.692
I knew this guy who knew this guy
who shot documentaries.

46:37.861 --> 46:41.661
He went to the Amazon with this crew,
and they were all eaten by snakes.

46:41.832 --> 46:44.960
Come on, you knew a guy who
knew a guy, that's an urban myth.

46:54.378 --> 46:55.845
I'm sorry about Ben.

46:59.016 --> 47:01.382
I never should've stayed
on the Mendranang.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.877
What do you mean?

47:04.054 --> 47:07.546
Well, I figured he didn't tell the others,
but I thought you knew.

47:07.891 --> 47:09.153
Knew what?

47:11.562 --> 47:14.690
Byron offered me an extra 50 grand
to stay on the river.

47:15.098 --> 47:19.034
I told him it might get rough,
but he wanted to risk it.

47:19.303 --> 47:22.238
Hey. Don't blame him.

47:22.406 --> 47:24.203
It was my call.

47:24.908 --> 47:26.967
I took the money.

47:27.144 --> 47:28.873
I thought I could get us through.

47:29.112 --> 47:32.775
You wanna blame anyone?
You blame me.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.122
These boots are killing me.

47:47.097 --> 47:49.531
- Cole.
- What?

47:49.700 --> 47:50.962
You got some...

47:55.739 --> 47:58.264
Oh, God, what is that?!
Get it off! Get it off!

47:58.442 --> 48:00.239
- Oh, my God! Take it off!
- Relax.

48:00.477 --> 48:01.944
- Help me! Help me!
- Hold on.

48:02.112 --> 48:04.046
- Get it off me!
- Hey! Calm down!

48:04.214 --> 48:05.647
- Get this off me!
- Calm down!

48:05.816 --> 48:07.909
Cole! Cole! Calm down.

48:08.518 --> 48:09.883
What is it? What is it?

48:10.487 --> 48:12.853
- Get it off me. Get it off.
- All right. Look.

48:13.023 --> 48:16.652
- Just a lighter. Just a lighter.
- Oh, hell no! You ain't burning me!

48:16.827 --> 48:19.819
Okay. Okay. Okay.

48:20.597 --> 48:22.462
You burn me, I'll kill you.

48:22.833 --> 48:24.892
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.

48:29.439 --> 48:32.340
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

48:33.210 --> 48:35.474
- What?
- Hold on. Put your arms up.

48:35.646 --> 48:37.045
What are you doing?

48:38.015 --> 48:39.778
Why are you going under my shirt?

48:41.952 --> 48:43.783
- What are you doing?
- Jesus.

48:44.454 --> 48:45.921
What, what? What is it?

48:47.724 --> 48:49.248
What is it? What is it?

48:49.426 --> 48:51.018
Anybody got a blowtorch?

49:03.974 --> 49:05.373
Stop!

49:08.812 --> 49:10.575
Careful.

49:16.219 --> 49:18.915
- What's it...?
- Lf that thing bit you...

49:19.089 --> 49:20.818
...you would be lumpuh.

49:21.258 --> 49:23.385
Paralyzed, like stone, for two days.

49:35.806 --> 49:39.765
- What do you call this fella?
- Laba laba batu. Stone spider.

49:39.943 --> 49:43.470
I may have discovered a valuable
new anesthetic agent for Wexell-Hall.

49:43.647 --> 49:47.515
Oh, no, no, no. Forget Wexell,
we can get this to the highest bidder.

49:48.685 --> 49:51.153
All right. Show and tell's over.

49:51.321 --> 49:55.587
We gotta get to that boat.
Put your boots on and let's go.

50:07.504 --> 50:09.131
Bugger it.

50:14.478 --> 50:15.740
What the hell was that?

50:36.867 --> 50:38.858
Holy bloody hell.

51:05.695 --> 51:07.959
Whoa! What was that?

51:09.199 --> 51:10.996
Oh, my God.

51:11.268 --> 51:13.065
What the hell was that?

51:13.503 --> 51:14.970
Come on.

51:20.577 --> 51:23.978
No, no, no! Oh, come on, man!

51:24.381 --> 51:25.848
What the hell happened?!

51:26.683 --> 51:28.241
Livingston!

51:30.821 --> 51:32.413
Here we go.

51:34.624 --> 51:36.717
He got drunk and fell off
the bloody boat!

51:41.665 --> 51:44.964
Your friend! Your friend!
Now what we gonna do now?!

51:46.837 --> 51:48.395
Shit!

51:49.606 --> 51:51.267
Search the wreckage.

51:52.676 --> 51:54.439
Find anything we can use.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.770
And hope to God there's a phone.

52:17.200 --> 52:18.599
Come on, come on.

52:18.802 --> 52:20.326
Yes.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.579
Hello?

52:32.215 --> 52:33.773
Hello?

52:33.950 --> 52:35.918
- Come on, come on!
- Anything?

52:36.086 --> 52:37.576
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.

52:37.754 --> 52:40.120
What do you think I'm doing, Jack?!

52:41.091 --> 52:43.150
Hello? Shit.

52:47.230 --> 52:48.697
Hello?

52:49.132 --> 52:50.599
Come on, man. Hello?

52:54.671 --> 52:56.536
All right, keep looking!

53:13.890 --> 53:15.517
No phone?

53:15.692 --> 53:18.786
- Nothing.
- Couldn't get a signal on the radio.

53:21.364 --> 53:22.854
Now what?

53:37.013 --> 53:38.640
What's going on?

53:39.950 --> 53:41.281
Where'd these come from?

53:42.018 --> 53:43.883
- Lopaks.
- Who?

53:44.054 --> 53:45.385
Local tribe.

53:45.555 --> 53:47.785
- Descended from headhunters.
- What?

53:48.024 --> 53:50.254
Been in this region
for thousands of years.

53:50.427 --> 53:53.123
- Headhunters?
- There's still some villages here.

53:53.296 --> 53:56.163
- Must be one of their fishing spots.
- Hold on, excuse me.

53:56.333 --> 53:57.994
Did you say headhunters?

53:59.669 --> 54:02.331
There haven't been practicing
headhunters in Borneo for a century.

54:02.505 --> 54:06.134
Just because they ain't practicing
don't mean they don't remember how.

54:07.110 --> 54:09.806
They must be along this branch
of the river.

54:10.313 --> 54:14.409
If we can find their village,
maybe they can lend us a boat.

54:15.986 --> 54:20.082
So wait a minute. We just gonna walk
towards the headhunters, not away?

54:20.624 --> 54:22.216
Yeah.

54:23.226 --> 54:24.693
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

54:43.113 --> 54:48.483
Oh, God. I'm so hungry, I'd sell
my grandmother for a Tic Tac.

54:49.419 --> 54:51.444
You mention food one more time...

54:52.922 --> 54:54.651
...I'm voting you off this island.

55:06.403 --> 55:08.132
Oh, God.

55:09.005 --> 55:12.168
- Is that...?
- Livingston.

55:12.342 --> 55:14.970
Oh, my God, man.
What the hell happened to him?

55:15.145 --> 55:16.772
Anaconda.

55:20.483 --> 55:22.041
If he was eaten by the snake...

55:22.218 --> 55:24.152
...why is his body...?
- Listen, listen!

55:26.956 --> 55:31.689
All right. These things are
at their weakest when they digest.

55:32.295 --> 55:36.425
But if threatened, they will spit up
their food and attack again.

55:36.599 --> 55:39.591
What? There's a snake out there
with an empty stomach?

55:39.769 --> 55:41.896
- Yeah.
- The same one that got Ben?

55:42.072 --> 55:46.031
No. No. There's no way that snake
could've gotten to Livingston.

55:46.209 --> 55:49.076
- It had to be another one.
- You said there wouldn't be...

55:49.245 --> 55:51.372
...another one for miles.
- There wouldn't.

55:53.049 --> 55:54.949
- Unless...
- Unless what?

55:56.353 --> 55:59.015
- Unless it's mating season.
- Oh, my God.

55:59.189 --> 56:01.214
- Mating season?
- Yeah.

56:02.258 --> 56:06.251
You see, the males are territorial,
but when they smell a female in heat...

56:06.796 --> 56:09.822
...they come running
from everywhere.

56:09.999 --> 56:14.561
Females find a nice, wet, muddy pit,
and they all go after her at once...

56:15.472 --> 56:17.406
...in one big mating ball.

56:17.574 --> 56:19.906
So there's some snake orgy
out in the jungle?!

56:20.076 --> 56:21.941
Yeah. Something like that.

56:22.612 --> 56:25.137
Look, we're losing the light.

56:25.415 --> 56:30.819
All we gotta do is get to that village.
So please, pay attention.

56:31.154 --> 56:35.591
Do not stray from the group.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.527
Let's go.

56:52.976 --> 56:56.139
Stay quiet. Sacred burial ground.

57:29.145 --> 57:31.113
Jesus.

57:36.186 --> 57:39.644
I thought you said that anaconda
was the biggest you'd ever seen.

57:39.989 --> 57:41.422
It was.

57:41.591 --> 57:43.855
- Well, this one's...
- Bigger.

57:44.327 --> 57:47.626
The males must've come through here
looking for the female.

57:57.040 --> 57:58.974
Some bullshit.

58:05.181 --> 58:07.877
- They took their boats.
- Good for them.

58:08.518 --> 58:10.110
Bad for us.

58:10.620 --> 58:12.520
Which one's the Mendranang?

58:12.956 --> 58:16.153
On the right.
The Tokut keeps going to the left.

58:16.326 --> 58:18.988
- Fastest way to Kotabaru.
- How long?

58:21.297 --> 58:24.266
You'll be soaking in a tub
at the Four Seasons in two days.

58:24.434 --> 58:26.368
How, man?
We don't even have a boat.

58:26.536 --> 58:27.935
We're gonna build one.

58:55.765 --> 58:58.529
Man, do that in my neighborhood,
and that's your ass.

58:59.435 --> 59:00.663
Shit.

59:37.006 --> 59:38.633
Sam.

59:44.914 --> 59:47.075
What does this look like to you?

59:53.856 --> 59:55.346
My God.

59:56.993 --> 59:58.756
Perrinia immortalis.

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:02.461
Now we know why these snakes
are so big.

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:03.894
What?

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.763
Anacondas keep growing
till they die, right?

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.870
And these are the biggest
Bill's ever seen.

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:11.165
- Because they're living longer.
- Exactly.

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:14.576
Because Perrinia immortalis
is part of the food chain.

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.638
These snakes have transcended
the Hayflick limit.

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:21.147
The chemical in the orchid
does exactly what we predicted.

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:24.650
And not in theory, in the real world.

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:29.648
This is proof, Sam,
of your research, carved in stone.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.650
This is proof?

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.890
It's anecdotal evidence at best.

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:39.697
- Let's get to the orchid and find out.
- You are out of your mind.

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.734
Do you have any idea
how close we are?

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.318
The orchid was found here...

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:00.047
...on the Mendranang,
just around the next bend.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:03.122
- We'll be going right past it.
- No, we won't.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.021
We are going down the Tokut.

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:07.856
If we go down the Mendranang,
it's gonna be a week...

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:12.400
...before we reach another village.
I'm not waiting that long for my bath.

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.930
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.838
Jack.

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:24.903
Maybe you can just come back.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.107
Come back?

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.878
In seven years?
What if it's not here?

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:35.457
What if some local farmer decides
to slash and burn the entire basin?

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:39.061
Instead of the fountain of youth,
we'll have a giant rice paddy.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.292
This is our only chance.
You know it is.

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:48.832
Do you wanna give in
when we're this close?

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:53.101
Look. You know
I got your back, right?

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:57.744
We've been in the trenches
a hundred times together.

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:01.475
- But I'm not going in that jungle.
- Damn straight, man.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.149
Thank you.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:14.591
This is my expedition,
and we're going to the orchid.

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.292
No.

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:19.696
We're not.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.567
Don't be an idiot, Sam.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.065
This is bigger than penicillin,
for God's sake.

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.904
Lives will be saved by this drug.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.603
People will live longer.
They'll stay young longer.

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:36.013
If we don't put this to human trials,
it'll be a crime against humanity.

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:37.652
Two people have died already.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.948
Scientists have always risked
their lives to change the world.

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:45.356
If they didn't, we wouldn't have cures
for yellow fever, polio and smallpox.

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:48.463
- We all knew the risks.
- We thought we did.

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:52.089
Until you decided to start making
decisions behind our backs.

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:58.839
- What are you talking about?
- He offered Bill an extra 50 grand...

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:02.034
...to keep going, even though
he knew it wasn't safe.

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:03.838
Oh, my God.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.341
Is that true, Jack?

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:14.113
- I was thinking of the expedition.
- You were thinking of your career.

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:21.421
Look. You're my assistant.

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.893
I don't need to consult you!

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.372
I'm the one with the authority here.

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:36.374
We're in the middle
of the jungle, Jack.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:41.845
At this point, your authority
is what we say it is.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.879
Guess you got a mutiny
on your hands.

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:06.841
Thank you.

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:15.311
Okay. Keep it high.

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.981
Careful.

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:23.220
Center it right here.

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.792
All right.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:40.007
What are you doing?

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:41.939
Never seen a man shave before?

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.706
Probably a lot sharper
before you attacked that alligator.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.449
Crocodile.

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.452
What's that mean?

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:57.289
That means "a new beginning."
It's Korean.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.821
I got it when I was in the military.

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:01.625
What brought you here?

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:06.157
- Long story.
- Where am I gonna go?

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.331
All right.

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:12.864
Here's the deal.
I was in the Special Forces...

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:16.341
...and I saw and did things...

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:19.845
...that I wanted to forget.

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:24.050
Sometimes we do the wrong things
for the right reasons, you know?

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:27.117
It's not very long, as stories go.

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.450
Yeah.

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:32.623
Well, I got out of the military...

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:35.525
...came here and bought
the Bloody Mary.

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:39.291
Just wanted to start a new life.

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:04.117
Thank you, Jack.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.347
On three.

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:31.179
Ready? One, two, three.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.685
It works.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.150
All right.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.637
Let me explain.

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:59.313
Why in the hell didn't you tell me
about this?

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:06.312
The minute someone makes a call...

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:07.854
...this expedition's over.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.286
Exactly.

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:13.158
All I'm asking for
is a few more hours.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:14.956
We continue on the Mendranang...

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:18.459
...take our orchid samples,
then we call for help.

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:21.194
Forget about it, Jack.
I'm getting us out of here.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.806
Think about this, Gordon.

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:29.035
You're about to become a billionaire.
Do you really want to give all that up?

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.406
I don't care about the money,
all right?

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.377
I wanna live.

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:47.294
It bit me.

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:56.034
Jack, what are you...?

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.076
What are you...?

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:16.453
Help.

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:22.752
Help.

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.193
Help me.

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.243
Where's Mitchell?

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.140
Resting his feet.

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.214
- Should I go get him?
- No, no.

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.782
- Let him rest till we get loaded.
- Okay.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.716
Those blisters are pretty nasty.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.205
Mitchell...

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.636
...you okay?

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:13.872
Mitchell?

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:17.645
What is it?

01:09:18.953 --> 01:09:20.353
Tell me.

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.157
What did you do to him, Jack?

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:05.191
- What is it?
- Something's wrong with Mitchell.

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:08.430
- What are you talking about?
- You were alone with him.

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.367
What did you do?

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:13.133
He was resting his feet.
I didn't do anything.

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.076
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.064
Oh, my God.

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:40.601
Gail, no! Let's go!

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.270
Get out! Get out! Go!

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.831
Come on! Come on!

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.811
Move! Move! Move! Go!

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.853
The raft!

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:11.294
No! You son of a bitch!

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:15.002
We can build another one.

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:17.600
With what?!

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:19.035
With what, Sam?!

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:21.842
We gotta get to the raft.

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:26.136
- It's our only way out of here.
- FYI, Bill, the raft is gone!

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:28.779
- We can get it back.
- How?!

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:31.513
How? We gonna swim
after it now?

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:34.583
Look...

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:37.024
...the village is here.

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.686
Jack is following
the Mendranang.

01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:41.992
We cut across the jungle.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:45.300
- We can catch him on the other side.
- Right.

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.534
- Catch him where?
- He's going to that orchid.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.634
We find that flower...

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.677
...we find that raft.

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:13.829
Oh, thank God. It's Jack Byron.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:16.093
Oh, thank God. It's Jack Byron.

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.460
Listen, something terrible
has happened.

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:21.626
We took the wrong way
on the Mendranang.

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:23.533
We went over a waterfall.

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.964
I haven't seen anyone since.
I am...

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.375
I think I'm the only one left.

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.616
Wait, wait. Listen.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.784
Oh, shit. Come on!

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.329
It's in front of us.

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:59.804
Son of a bitch.
It's trying to separate us.

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:04.776
Oh, shit.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.518
- Oh, Christ, it's everywhere.
- Turn that goddamn thing off.

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:12.517
- They can see it.
- Doesn't matter.

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:15.020
- They can sense our body heat.
- He's right.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:17.090
Let's just get the hell out of here.

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.675
- Which way?
- Hold on.

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.049
Any way.

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:50.951
- Let's go, Cole!
- Okay, okay!

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.684
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:54.658
Hold on, wait for me!

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.971
Oh, my God.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:18.214
If there's a way in, there's a way out.

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:28.526
Oh, shit!

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:46.841
- Guys?!
- Cole!

01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:49.511
Which way?!

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.118
Over here!

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:56.456
- All right, say it again! Say it again!
- Cole! Over here!

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:58.653
Over here, Cole!

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:01.762
- Hello!
- This way, Cole!

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.864
- Guys!
- Cole!

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.781
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.181
God, come on!

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:30.787
Cole!

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.730
Oh, no, no!

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.961
Stay together.

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:46.135
Okay. I promise.
Now can we please go?

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:48.105
- Let's go.
- No problem. Okay, okay.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.811
Which way?

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:03.424
- I don't know.
- What?

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.685
What do you mean,
you don't know?

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:07.761
I found you, didn't I?

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:18.537
Tran?

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:21.772
Tran!

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.021
Tran!

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:44.397
Say something!

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:58.842
Oh, shit! Guys! Guys!

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:01.844
I can see light.

01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:04.542
- Is there a way out?
- I don't know.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.051
Cole!

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:09.280
Tran!

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.422
Can you hear me?

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:14.521
Cole!

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:17.124
Where are you?

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:33.007
I think I found a way out.

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:37.674
Take this. Go. Now.

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:41.255
- Where are they?
- Go.

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.386
Oh, my God.

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.923
Go.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.329
- Help!
- Cole?

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:57.438
- Cole?
- Hey, right here!

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:02.369
Almost there.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.904
Holy shit!

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:08.345
Move! It's coming up my ass!

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.681
Help me! What did I do?!

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:28.430
Where's Cole?

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:33.439
- Cole, come on!
- Cole! Come on!

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:36.307
- Give me your hand.
- Oh, God! I'm stuck!

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:38.469
- Give me your...
- I'm stuck! Pull me!

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.808
- Give me your arm!
- Hurry up! Come on!

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:44.750
Oh, my God! It's coming!
Let's go! Pull!

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.581
Pull!

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:07.303
That's what I'm talking about, Sam!

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:10.843
Oh, my God! You're the bomb, Sam!
You Lorena Bobbitt-ed that ass!

01:19:11.012 --> 01:19:12.479
How you like her now, bitch?!

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:14.581
She sliced you, diced you,
cut you up!

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.479
Sam with the samurai action!

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:22.953
Hell, no.

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.361
Cole!

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:00.888
Get up, Cole. Get up, man.
Wake up, man.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.029
Come on, man. Wake up.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:05.894
No, no, no.

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.796
Cole. He's not breathing!

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.931
- He's got a pulse.
- Give him air!

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:12.334
Okay.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.073
Again, again!

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.379
Come on, wake up!
Don't you die!

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.140
Don't die. Come on, no.

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:34.061
What the fuck?! Get it off me!

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:37.027
- No, no. It's okay! It's okay!
- Hey, it's okay.

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.530
It's me. Stay down.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.133
- You're okay.
- I'm okay?

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:41.929
- Yeah.
- You're okay.

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:51.598
Perrinia immortalis.

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:16.119
- Son of a bitch finally got his orchid.
- Yeah. He can have them.

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:19.595
All I care about is that raft.

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:21.600
Let's go.

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:47.084
Oh, my God. Thank God.

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:06.545
I think I know what happened
to Mitchell.

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.113
I can't let you take that.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.262
You guys look like hell.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:26.891
- You don't know what hell is.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:29.935
- But you gave me no choice.
- Did you give Mitchell one...

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:32.665
...before you killed him?
- I didn't kill Mitchell.

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:34.370
No...

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:36.200
...you just let him die.

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:39.070
I saw the spider bite
on his arm.

01:23:39.247 --> 01:23:41.112
What was I supposed to do, Sam?

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:45.278
- The right thing?
- It's always a good place to start.

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:50.255
Let's not be stupid about this.

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:54.687
Let's get to the flower,
we can all go home.

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:32.461
The mating ball.

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:39.071
Give me the flare.

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:50.243
Tie him up.

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.150
Now!

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.632
- Fill it up.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:15.099
Do I look like I'm kidding?!
Fill it up!

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.636
Get up!

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.974
- Now get the flowers.
- Okay.

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:30.040
Throw me the pack.

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:36.722
Drop the gun!

01:26:44.432 --> 01:26:45.694
Throw me the pack.

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:06.611
Get up, Bill! Get up!

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.093
Come on, man!

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:19.729
Get up!

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:26.905
Get up!

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:39.313
- Sam, come on!
- Sam! Come on!

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:41.478
- Come on, girl! Hurry up!
- Come on!

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:46.317
- Sam! Come on!
- Come on! Hurry up, Sam!

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:51.162
- Come on, baby!
- You got it, honey, come on!

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:54.796
Shit!

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:57.633
- Come on, baby.
- You got it!

01:27:57.805 --> 01:28:00.000
- You got it, honey!
- Almost there! Come on!

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:04.669
- Spider...
- Reach for me!

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:07.872
Come on, Sam, please!
Just reach! Reach!

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:12.452
Give me your hand.

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:17.959
- Come on!
- Right here, Sam! Right here!

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:20.519
- Come on!
- Right here, Sam! Right here!

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.533
No! No! No!

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:38.009
No!

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:50.147
Oh, God!

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:56.492
Come on, Sam! Come on!

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:58.996
- Keep coming!
- Come on!

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:03.736
Climb up that wall, Sam!
Keep coming.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.704
Come on, girl!

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.198
- Come on!
- Come on. I got you!

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:17.783
Come on, Sam, get back!

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:20.786
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:26.726
Hey!

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:28.191
Over here, bitch!

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:37.820
Holy shit.

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:48.867
Nice shot.

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:51.638
What can I say?

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.713
I'm a bad man.

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:26.647
You two look like you made up.

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:29.213
He's not so bad.

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:31.174
How's that?

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:33.244
Much better.

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.820
I think I'll live.

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.218
Good.

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:39.983
It's kind of nice having you around.

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:46.889
- So how much further to my bath?
- Kotabaru?

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:49.032
I'd say...

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:51.330
...another day downriver.
- Another day?

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:53.940
- I'm not rowing another day, homeboy.
- All right.

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:56.576
Let's see, we got this shortcut
right up...

01:31:56.744 --> 01:31:58.371
No!
