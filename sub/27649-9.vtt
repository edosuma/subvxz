00:05.944 --> 00:08.504
I wonder, Dr Alexander,
would you be so kind

00:08.504 --> 00:12.344
as to read the highlighted
section of your postmortem report

00:12.344 --> 00:15.480
concerning the tragic death
of PC Steven Francis?

00:18.104 --> 00:22.013
To the naked eye, the mitral valve
looked abnormally loose.

00:22.013 --> 00:25.853
Microscopic examination revealed
it was gelatinous.

00:27.320 --> 00:32.311
What was the date you performed
PC Francis's postmortem?

00:33.293 --> 00:35.384
Um...

00:37.048 --> 00:38.840
The 14th of May.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.312
A Monday morning.

00:40.312 --> 00:41.813
9am sharp.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.584
Yes.Can you remember where you were

00:46.584 --> 00:50.232
the weekend directly
before the 14th of May?

00:50.232 --> 00:52.088
Sorry?

00:52.088 --> 00:53.496
Let me jog your memory.

00:53.496 --> 00:56.888
Social media accounts suggest
you were in America.

00:57.976 --> 00:59.832
Is that right?

00:59.832 --> 01:01.816
I...

01:01.816 --> 01:03.032
I don't know.

01:03.032 --> 01:04.440
Yes.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.896
I understand you regularly
hop between continents.

01:07.896 --> 01:09.304
That has no bearing...

01:09.304 --> 01:11.992
I once came back on the red eye
and it took me days to recover.

01:11.992 --> 01:14.232
I don't know how
you do it regularly...

01:14.232 --> 01:18.072
Mrs Morrison,
have you a question for the witness?

01:18.072 --> 01:20.120
My lord.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.173
I wonder, if you would be so kind
as to read the highlighted section

01:24.173 --> 01:28.440
of Professor Long's postmortem
on Police Constable Francis?

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.176 --> 01:44.760
"The heart showed no abnormality
and there is no pathological

01:44.760 --> 01:48.152
"disease that would cause or
contribute to death."

01:48.152 --> 01:51.992
Your postmortem states that
the heart was diseased, which,

01:51.992 --> 01:56.152
in your expert opinion, would
suggest that the police officer

01:56.152 --> 02:00.184
died as a result of a previously
undetected heart condition,

02:00.184 --> 02:05.240
whereas Professor Long's
postmortem states it was

02:05.240 --> 02:10.252
a healthy heart, thereby confirming
what I suggest is the truth,

02:11.384 --> 02:16.440
namely, that young PC Steven Francis
died as the result of the brutal

02:16.973 --> 02:21.688
and vicious assault he sustained
at the hands of the two defendants.

02:21.688 --> 02:24.773
Mrs Morrison, that's just comment.

02:24.773 --> 02:27.533
Shall we save these speeches
until the end?

02:29.368 --> 02:32.632
A question for the witness, please.

02:32.632 --> 02:36.792
If I may, My Lord, exhibit 12B.

02:36.792 --> 02:39.736
The photographs
from Professor Long's

02:39.736 --> 02:43.256
examination of PC Francis's heart.

02:44.600 --> 02:49.720
Dr Alexander, these
photographs of the mitral valve -

02:50.040 --> 02:52.536
in your professional opinion;

02:52.536 --> 02:55.864
are they indicative of
a healthy heart or not?

03:05.528 --> 03:07.013
Doctor?

03:09.944 --> 03:11.813
Yes? No?

03:16.792 --> 03:21.208
From these photographs I would have
to concur with Professor Long,

03:21.208 --> 03:23.453
but if you look
at the photographs...

03:23.453 --> 03:28.312
So these photographs confirm PC
Steven Francis had a healthy heart.

03:28.312 --> 03:31.133
These photographs do confirm
a healthy heart.

03:32.664 --> 03:34.776
But if you look at
the photographs that I took...

03:34.776 --> 03:36.184
No more questions.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.624
How the hell did you get
those results?

03:49.624 --> 03:51.224
I could ask you the same question.

03:51.224 --> 03:54.104
And why was I only shown your report
an hour before?

03:54.104 --> 03:55.512
That I can't answer.

03:55.512 --> 03:58.264
I sent my report in to
the police over a week ago.

03:58.264 --> 03:59.992
And they withheld it?

03:59.992 --> 04:02.168
If you'd had my report for
over a month, Nikki,

04:02.168 --> 04:04.792
it would have made little
difference. You made a mistake -

04:04.792 --> 04:07.493
it happens to the best of us.
I didn't make a mistake.

04:07.493 --> 04:09.208
You've just said as much
in open court -

04:09.208 --> 04:11.093
you were wrong, simple as that.

04:18.552 --> 04:23.608
 Testator silens

04:27.384 --> 04:32.453
 Costestes e spiritu

04:33.272 --> 04:38.213
 Silentium

04:49.592 --> 04:54.456
 Testator silens.

05:45.016 --> 05:47.384
Nikki.
How are you doing this morning?

05:47.384 --> 05:50.136
Can you tell me how
so many journalists have
got hold of my number?

05:50.136 --> 05:52.013
What time are
you going in to the Lyell?

05:52.013 --> 05:53.464
I didn't make a mistake.

05:53.464 --> 05:55.133
I know. I know you didn't.

05:55.133 --> 05:56.600
Have you spoken to Amanda Long?

05:56.600 --> 05:58.200
No. Not yet. Why?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.773
Apparently her report was
accidentally sent late by

06:00.773 --> 06:04.280
the police, who say there was some
mysterious administrative cock-up.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.880
Nikki, this is not a conspiracy.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.544
I know my findings
weren't popular

06:07.544 --> 06:09.976
with the police officer's family
and with the police, but...

06:09.976 --> 06:12.344
It's not our job to be popular.

06:12.344 --> 06:14.520
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

06:14.520 --> 06:17.080
and I intend to find out
exactly what it is.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.896
I was just ringing to see
how you were. That's all.

06:19.896 --> 06:22.520
I'm fine, Thomas. Thanks.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.568
Look, I'd better get started here.

06:24.568 --> 06:27.640
I'll see you later.
OK. Cheers, bye.

06:28.984 --> 06:30.712
Is Jack here?

06:30.712 --> 06:33.848
Jack, er, yeah.
He's over by the other car.

06:51.064 --> 06:52.856
Maybe she did make a mistake.

06:52.856 --> 06:55.032
I was part of that investigation.

06:55.032 --> 06:58.104
Does that mean
you made a mistake, too?

06:58.104 --> 07:00.728
Look, there's no doubting that
the policeman was attacked,

07:00.728 --> 07:03.672
there's no doubt he received
a number of blows to the back of his

07:03.672 --> 07:06.680
head and face and one to his lower
abdomen, but not enough to kill him.

07:08.472 --> 07:11.352
Had Nikki just
come back from America?

07:11.352 --> 07:12.952
That's completely irrelevant.

07:12.952 --> 07:14.360
Is it?

07:14.360 --> 07:18.200
The prosecution barrister
only said that to make Nikki look...

07:18.200 --> 07:21.272
"So to confirm, Dr Alexander,
after flying for eight hours

07:21.272 --> 07:24.920
"through the night, you came
straight to the Lyell, where..."

07:24.920 --> 07:27.352
Where she did her job to
the same exacting standards

07:27.352 --> 07:29.784
and professionalism that...

07:29.784 --> 07:31.832
Where are you going, Max?

07:31.832 --> 07:34.456
Bins. It's rubbish day.

07:34.456 --> 07:36.120
Yes, it is.

07:42.968 --> 07:45.720
Of all the crime scenes
in all the world...

07:45.720 --> 07:50.136
Detective Constable Vail -
I thought you were moving on.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.056
So did I.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.976
You invited me
to your leaving party.

07:53.976 --> 07:55.192
What happened?

07:55.192 --> 07:56.408
Events.

07:57.816 --> 08:00.056
Canal tour's this way.Yeah.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.512
You think
this one's suspicious, too?

08:03.512 --> 08:07.800
I think everything and everyone
is suspicious, Jack. You know me.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.336
Glad to hear it.

08:10.808 --> 08:14.136
We've had a number of
serious incidents down here.

08:14.136 --> 08:17.720
If this was gang-related we need to
know about it, before it kicks off.

08:17.720 --> 08:18.936
Again.

08:20.024 --> 08:24.653
Right. A couple of rowers from
the club down the way saw the body

08:24.653 --> 08:26.040
floating out there.

08:27.192 --> 08:29.496
What do you make of those bruises?

08:29.496 --> 08:31.224
The ones round his neck?

08:31.224 --> 08:34.373
Could he have got them
whilst he was in the water?

08:34.373 --> 08:35.832
A boat hitting him, maybe?

08:35.832 --> 08:37.624
Possible.

08:37.624 --> 08:39.672
They look older than that, though.

08:39.672 --> 08:40.696
More here, look.

08:40.696 --> 08:42.424
Are they needle marks?

08:44.933 --> 08:46.584
Possibly.

08:46.584 --> 08:49.400
They do look more recent.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.872
You see his hand?

08:50.872 --> 08:53.112
Maybe he was holding on
to something.

08:53.112 --> 08:55.493
Experienced a heart attack?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.080
He's only wearing half a wet suit.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.552
If he went in the water,
what is it?

08:58.552 --> 09:00.344
A few degrees above freezing...

09:00.344 --> 09:03.224
If he was out there
canoeing or windsurfing -

09:03.224 --> 09:05.813
a lot of people tend to
only wear their bottoms.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.024
We'll get him back to the Lyell.

09:08.024 --> 09:09.304
Take a closer look.

09:10.904 --> 09:12.952
Isn't your partner into
that sort of stuff?

09:12.952 --> 09:14.424
Sorry, I've forgotten her name.

09:14.424 --> 09:18.328
Julie. Yeah, she did
a lot of wind surfing -

09:18.328 --> 09:20.824
Newquay, Spain, Hawaii.

09:20.824 --> 09:25.304
It's why we were moving away,
so she could compete.

09:25.304 --> 09:30.053
She got caught by this big wave
in the summer and she didn't...

09:33.653 --> 09:35.544
Not waving, but drowning.

09:35.544 --> 09:37.400
I'm so sorry.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.008
Just when you thought
it was safe, eh?

09:42.008 --> 09:43.800
Events.

09:44.632 --> 09:47.576
4.23 on his watch.

09:47.576 --> 09:50.213
Time of death?Could be.

09:50.213 --> 09:52.568
It might not have been
working when he went in.

09:52.568 --> 09:54.616
What time did the rowers find him?

09:54.616 --> 09:56.344
About 6.30 this morning.

09:56.344 --> 09:58.520
So what? Two hours?

09:58.520 --> 10:01.733
Yeah.
Given the waterlogging on his hands

10:01.733 --> 10:04.792
and the temperature of the water,
two hours seems about right.

10:07.613 --> 10:10.373
Oh, shit.

10:10.373 --> 10:12.984
What time do you call this?

10:12.984 --> 10:15.352
I got waylaid by
the reporters outside.

10:15.352 --> 10:17.976
And what did you tell them,
may I ask?

10:17.976 --> 10:19.192
Nothing.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.853
OK.

10:22.853 --> 10:27.128
I simply reiterated what I'd said in
court, that I hadn't made a mistake.

10:27.128 --> 10:30.264
That's not really talking to them
or telling them anything.

10:30.264 --> 10:33.208
It's also exactly what I told them.

10:37.013 --> 10:39.480
Do you think there'll be an inquiry?

10:39.480 --> 10:42.552
Given the "enormous chasm"
in opinions...

10:42.552 --> 10:43.733
Who said that?

10:43.733 --> 10:45.816
The taxi driver had his radio on.

10:45.816 --> 10:47.032
Good morning.

10:47.032 --> 10:49.208
Morning.Morning.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.640
A body's on its way in -
a drowned man.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.520
Jack wonders if you could take
a look, as soon as possible?

10:54.520 --> 10:56.213
Yeah. Are you observing on this one?

10:56.213 --> 10:57.784
If that's OK.

10:57.784 --> 10:59.000
Best way to learn.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.112
Can you prep the postmortem room,
please?

11:01.112 --> 11:03.173
Yeah, of course.Thanks.

11:04.312 --> 11:07.192
246 new e-mails?!

11:09.773 --> 11:12.440
247, 48...

11:12.440 --> 11:15.512
Making mistakes can make you
popular - who knew?

11:17.240 --> 11:18.584
Too soon.

11:27.224 --> 11:29.093
I didn't think you'd come.

11:29.093 --> 11:31.064
I didn't think I had a choice.

11:31.064 --> 11:32.344
This is serious, Thomas.

11:32.344 --> 11:33.752
I'm not denying that.

11:33.752 --> 11:35.032
Nikki has got it wrong...

11:35.032 --> 11:36.376
Wait, wait, wait.

11:36.376 --> 11:38.232
In your opinion
she's made a mistake.

11:38.232 --> 11:40.984
It's not just an opinion -
have you read my report?

11:40.984 --> 11:43.352
Yeah. I've also read Nikki's report.

11:43.352 --> 11:45.336
Nikki is a brilliant pathologist,

11:45.336 --> 11:47.960
I don't doubt that for one moment -
but what worries me,

11:47.960 --> 11:50.333
and should worry you, is that
when you make a mistake...

11:50.333 --> 11:51.480
I don't believe she has.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.053
What? You don't
believe your own eyes?

11:58.136 --> 12:01.144
I've submitted a report to
the coroner for a third postmortem.

12:01.144 --> 12:03.256
I recommend that you do it, too.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.792
I couldn't do that.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.480
You're worried about upsetting
Nikki.No, no, it's not that.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.493
If you agreed to do another PM, it
would mean you didn't believe her.

12:10.493 --> 12:12.472
That's not how Nikki operates.

12:12.472 --> 12:16.568
Thomas,
your loyalty, it's very touching.

12:16.568 --> 12:19.000
I would expect nothing less.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.688
But it's not just that
Nikki has made a mistake...

12:23.933 --> 12:26.360
Something we all do.

12:31.544 --> 12:34.872
Amanda. You made the right decision.

12:34.872 --> 12:36.344
Yeah. Well.

12:36.344 --> 12:38.712
If that were true,
why do I miss you so much?

12:38.712 --> 12:41.592
Why do I always
find myself thinking of us?

12:43.064 --> 12:45.432
I don't even have a photo of you.

12:46.973 --> 12:48.824
Look. We talked this through.

12:48.824 --> 12:52.536
We agreed it was for the best,
your marriage was more important -

12:52.536 --> 12:54.968
it is more important.

12:54.968 --> 12:57.656
I'm admitting to making
a mistake, Thomas

12:57.656 --> 12:59.896
and that's exactly
what Nikki needs to do.

13:31.192 --> 13:33.432
This is the body of
a well nourished male.

13:33.432 --> 13:35.813
I'll provide the height
and weight in due course.

13:42.264 --> 13:44.573
There's a band of reddening
on the outer aspect

13:44.573 --> 13:46.133
of both lower forearms.

13:48.216 --> 13:50.264
Possibly some form of restraint.

13:57.176 --> 13:59.352
of intravenous injections
in both arms...

14:01.400 --> 14:03.653
...but these look relatively recent

14:03.653 --> 14:05.112
and the veins look healthy.

14:07.288 --> 14:11.213
There are a number of other
puncture marks on the hands.

14:11.213 --> 14:12.600
None in the groin area...

14:15.160 --> 14:18.104
...but there are some on the feet.

14:18.104 --> 14:21.560
They're not normal
for puncture sites?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.800
Exactly.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.784
And there's no evidence
of track marks.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.293
There's some sort of white substance

14:33.293 --> 14:35.960
adherent to the hair
on the right hallux.

14:43.973 --> 14:45.304
Looks like wax.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.400
Then there's this
mark on his forehead.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.896
Looks like
some kind of pigment to me.

14:51.896 --> 14:53.368
Could be a tilaka.

14:53.368 --> 14:57.080
Hindu mark worn
on the forehead like a bindi.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.600
Whatever it was, it stayed on
while he was in the water.

15:14.552 --> 15:16.600
How you getting on?

15:16.600 --> 15:18.584
Jack wants to know.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.824
As if I'd care about how you were
feeling after your very

15:20.824 --> 15:22.493
public fall from grace.

15:23.896 --> 15:28.312
If there's nothing on finger
prints or the DNA Database,

15:28.312 --> 15:30.552
this might help identify him.

15:30.552 --> 15:32.280
What is it?

15:36.312 --> 15:37.912
Cochlear hearing device.

15:37.912 --> 15:40.344
He wasn't poor, then.

15:40.344 --> 15:42.968
They cost over £50,000.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.064
We've got a serial number.

15:47.064 --> 15:48.664
Might give us something,

15:48.664 --> 15:50.264
where it was fitted.

15:50.264 --> 15:52.312
They're guaranteed for life,
I think.

15:52.312 --> 15:53.464
At that price.

15:53.464 --> 15:56.344
Then if something goes wrong
they can easily be tracked.

15:56.344 --> 15:59.032
Anything else I can tell Jack?

15:59.032 --> 16:03.320
All I can tell him right now is that
lividity suggests the body

16:03.320 --> 16:06.712
had been on its back for some time
before it entered the water.

16:06.712 --> 16:10.040
I shall report that to
Mr Hodgson directly.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.853
How did he get out there?

16:25.853 --> 16:28.664
If he was already dead when you
put him in the water, normally

16:28.664 --> 16:32.120
he'd just sink, but air trapped
in his wet suit kept him afloat.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.744
Now, there's not much current
to drift out there

16:34.744 --> 16:38.008
so chances are he'd just stay at the
side and not drift away somewhere.

16:38.008 --> 16:40.632
Which suggests he was on a boat
or a raft of some kind?

16:40.632 --> 16:42.104
Yeah.

16:42.104 --> 16:44.216
But was the body on a boat
that was passing or was it

16:44.216 --> 16:45.752
launched from the side on something?

16:48.568 --> 16:50.616
There's froth in the airways.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.432
It's consistent with drowning.

17:03.672 --> 17:06.053
Unless there was some other cause.

17:06.935 --> 17:08.920
Not what you were expecting?

17:10.136 --> 17:14.232
I'll take some bone samples
in a minute for a diatom test to see

17:14.232 --> 17:16.613
if he had an active circulation
when he went in the water.

17:16.613 --> 17:19.672
Will that determine
if he was dead before he was put in?

17:19.672 --> 17:23.384
Should do. We'll decalcify
and send them for testing.

17:23.384 --> 17:27.173
It looks like he drowned,
but not where they found him.

17:27.173 --> 17:28.632
I need to update Jack.

17:31.973 --> 17:36.952
I don't know how long, but given
Dr Alexander's done the postmortem,

17:37.080 --> 17:38.744
chances are, not very.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.328
Jack, this is DI Briggs.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.504
From the Lyell, am I right?

17:44.504 --> 17:46.296
That's right.
I can guess what's coming.

17:46.296 --> 17:47.512
I bet you can.

17:47.512 --> 17:50.968
"I thought Dr Alexander
was on our side."

17:50.968 --> 17:54.488
I'm not an idiot, I know
it doesn't work that way, Jack -

17:54.488 --> 17:58.904
we've all got to be objective - say
what you see without fear or favour.

17:58.904 --> 18:00.312
All right, then.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.040
But if those two shits get off

18:02.040 --> 18:04.920
because of Dame bloody Alexander's
evidence -

18:04.920 --> 18:06.840
she will not be a popular lady.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.656
So you only arrest someone
if it makes you look good?

18:09.656 --> 18:12.088
Very funny.
Just saying what I see.

18:15.352 --> 18:16.973
We've got something.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.600
At least someone's
getting on with the job.

18:23.032 --> 18:24.312
Well, yes.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.104
Let me spell that out for you.

18:26.104 --> 18:28.792
Have you got a pen
and a piece of paper? N-O...

18:28.792 --> 18:31.800
C-O-M-M-E-N-T.

18:33.464 --> 18:34.680
Press?

18:34.680 --> 18:35.960
Yeah.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.560
Looking for Nikki.
She still here?

18:37.560 --> 18:39.672
Finishing a PM on a drowned man.

18:41.336 --> 18:42.552
I know how he feels.

18:53.693 --> 18:56.184
Nikki. Hi.

18:56.184 --> 18:58.232
How's it going?

18:58.232 --> 19:01.624
People keep asking me that -
it's good to be working.

19:03.224 --> 19:07.733
Um, you and I should have a quick
talk, when you have a minute.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.112
Sure.

19:12.893 --> 19:17.112
My father used to sound like that
when he was disappointed in me.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.160
"Nix, you and I need to talk."

19:22.936 --> 19:25.304
Right, well, I'm all done here.

19:25.304 --> 19:26.584
OK. Yeah.

19:29.272 --> 19:31.896
I'll write up my report and take you
through it later if you like.

19:31.896 --> 19:33.304
Oh, great. Thanks.

19:37.208 --> 19:38.680
No phone so far.

19:40.024 --> 19:42.520
A bag, towel and strewn clothes.

19:42.520 --> 19:46.936
I know what the postmortem has
suggested - hear me out - but

19:46.936 --> 19:50.392
this looks like a guy got changed,
went for a swim and then died.

19:50.392 --> 19:52.632
Call me old-fashioned
but if that's what it looks like,

19:52.632 --> 19:55.000
then maybe, just maybe
that's exactly what it is.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.693
But we know the man was dead before.

19:56.693 --> 19:58.136
Yeah, and maybe he was.

19:58.136 --> 19:59.544
So how did he die?

19:59.544 --> 20:01.080
Did he get...?

20:01.080 --> 20:03.064
He gets in a canoe or
whatever he gets into -

20:03.064 --> 20:07.032
and something happens -
I don't know, an undetected heart

20:07.032 --> 20:11.093
condition maybe - he dies in
the canoe, in the dark, no lights,

20:11.093 --> 20:13.752
and a bigger boat comes along
and knocks him into the water.

20:13.752 --> 20:15.800
If this is about Dr Alexander...

20:15.800 --> 20:17.016
Don't kid yourself.

20:17.016 --> 20:21.240
This is about what I'm looking at
and it's also about resources.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.288
Oh, come on, if this was an accident

20:23.288 --> 20:27.000
or a suicide, that has huge
implications for this man's family.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.264
But that's one, maybe two,
family liaison officers.

20:30.264 --> 20:31.992
If this is a murder enquiry...

20:31.992 --> 20:35.704
"Kalan Dhanna.
Pujari Pharmaceuticals."

20:35.704 --> 20:38.136
Might save you some money,
Detective Inspector.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.632
It's about quarter of a mile
that way.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.032
Jack?

20:47.032 --> 20:48.440
Come on, Lyell man.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.813
Say what you see. I'm all ears.

20:50.813 --> 20:53.693
If he was dead
when he went in the water...

20:54.968 --> 20:56.824
...could all this be staged?

21:00.472 --> 21:03.928
I'm going to need a little more than
   a vague hunch that this was

21:03.928 --> 21:05.976
all some kind of set-up.

21:05.976 --> 21:08.813
Make some enquires,
talk to his manager,

21:08.813 --> 21:13.144
his colleagues... See what you can
find and let's see where this goes.

21:14.168 --> 21:17.112
It's been real.Oh, yeah.

23:04.568 --> 23:06.616
I wouldn't go in there.

23:06.616 --> 23:09.053
Why not? Who's he in there with?

23:09.053 --> 23:11.864
PC Steven Francis's parents.

23:11.864 --> 23:14.104
Why are they talking to him?
I did...

23:14.104 --> 23:17.944
They didn't want to
talk to you, not directly.

23:25.176 --> 23:27.480
Tell Thomas
I'll come in early tomorrow.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.973
I'll get him to call you.

23:28.973 --> 23:30.360
I'm turning off my phone.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.893
Hey...Don't ask me.

23:33.893 --> 23:35.992
I wouldn't dream of it.
Thank you.

23:35.992 --> 23:37.272
Welcome.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.344
Don't ask her what?

23:40.344 --> 23:42.264
How she is.

23:42.264 --> 23:45.413
Oh. How is she?Not good.

23:45.413 --> 23:46.680
One tea light.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.664
Found in an upturned canoe.

23:48.664 --> 23:49.688
Don't touch.

23:52.120 --> 23:56.152
That might explain the wax
Nikki found on the body.

23:56.152 --> 23:58.136
Hopefully get some prints off this.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.573
The Lyell, Clarissa Mullery
speaking, how can I help?

24:07.373 --> 24:10.232
Now let me spell that out for you.

24:10.232 --> 24:12.280
N-O C-O-M-M-E-N-T...

25:01.013 --> 25:03.608
Welcome to Pujari Pharmaceuticals.

25:03.608 --> 25:05.400
Let me show you through to the lab.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.864
I'm Detective Constable Vail.

25:19.864 --> 25:23.960
I want to ask you a few questions
about your colleague, Kalan Dhanna.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.712
Can you confirm
your full name, please?

25:26.712 --> 25:28.184
Jenna Hong.

25:28.184 --> 25:30.232
Richard Austin.

25:30.232 --> 25:32.280
Jacob Nduka.

25:32.280 --> 25:36.120
And how long have you
worked at Pujari Pharmaceuticals?

25:36.120 --> 25:37.528
Four years in April.

25:37.528 --> 25:38.744
About five years.

25:38.744 --> 25:40.792
Three and a half years.

25:43.864 --> 25:45.656
How did you know Kalan?

25:45.656 --> 25:48.600
We worked together
on a number of projects.

25:48.600 --> 25:52.184
Everyone said he was clever,
but I saw how hard he worked.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.808
I thought I was obsessed,
but Kalan...

25:56.472 --> 25:59.288
I can't believe he's dead.

25:59.288 --> 26:01.733
I can't believe he's dead.

26:01.733 --> 26:03.704
Are you sure it's him?

26:07.416 --> 26:09.912
Was he happy working here?

26:09.912 --> 26:13.496
He loved his work.
He was working on a new drug.

26:13.496 --> 26:16.184
It had the potential to change
the lives of millions...

26:16.184 --> 26:19.000
He was
so passionate about saving lives.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.624
I can't think of anyone
who didn't like him.

26:21.624 --> 26:23.864
He was always, always smiling.

26:25.144 --> 26:26.872
Everyone loved Kalan.

26:27.832 --> 26:29.752
Always smiling.

26:29.752 --> 26:33.413
The last time that I saw him was...

26:33.413 --> 26:35.320
it was over the weekend.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.752
It was in the afternoon, I think.

26:37.752 --> 26:39.480
Sunday.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.720
Do you know
if Kalan was religious at all?

26:41.720 --> 26:46.712
He used to say that his gifts,
his ability as a chemist -

26:46.712 --> 26:48.773
were given to him by God.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.088
I was jealous of that.

26:53.304 --> 26:54.712
His faith.

26:54.712 --> 26:57.413
For a scientist,
he was very spiritual.

27:23.512 --> 27:24.920
Nikki?

27:27.864 --> 27:29.080
Hi.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.488
Have a seat.

27:34.904 --> 27:37.400
I fully support you
and your findings,

27:37.400 --> 27:39.192
but I've spoken to Amanda Long...

27:39.192 --> 27:41.048
And did you tell her the same thing?

27:41.048 --> 27:42.840
That you fully support her
and her findings?

27:42.840 --> 27:45.080
This is not easy for me, Nikki.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.832
You weren't in that court
giving evidence -

27:47.832 --> 27:50.392
being mugged by a barrister
who took such delight in...

27:50.392 --> 27:52.888
Two men are about to be
convicted of the murder

27:52.888 --> 27:54.424
of a police officer.

27:54.424 --> 27:56.344
But the evidence clearly
suggests that would be

27:56.344 --> 27:58.776
a miscarriage of justice -
manslaughter, yes, but...

27:58.776 --> 28:02.168
Which is why, reluctantly, I've
agreed to do a third postmortem.

28:07.032 --> 28:10.493
If PC Francis didn't die
of the undetected heart condition,

28:10.493 --> 28:12.472
what's Professor Long's theory?

28:12.472 --> 28:15.352
He may well have died,
as the police believe...

28:15.352 --> 28:17.400
...as a result of the beatings
he received...

28:17.400 --> 28:19.320
Oh, not "soft tissue injury"!

28:19.320 --> 28:22.200
Controversial, I know, but it is
still an official cause of death.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.312
Usually declared
when there is no obvious cause,

28:24.312 --> 28:26.744
but there is an obvious cause.
Professor Long has looked at

28:26.744 --> 28:29.816
the heart and clearly failed to see
what I blatantly saw was there.

28:29.816 --> 28:32.312
I know why you might feel
undermined by this...Undermined?

28:32.312 --> 28:34.040
But that's not my intention.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.472
I have every faith in you
and in your work.

28:36.472 --> 28:38.392
Good. So do I.

28:39.608 --> 28:40.853
Nikki...

28:42.552 --> 28:45.653
So, Thomas is doing a third
postmortem.How did you guess?

28:45.653 --> 28:48.312
He's doing all
he can to protect you.

28:48.312 --> 28:51.832
I don't need protecting.
I've done nothing wrong.

28:51.832 --> 28:52.920
What did I miss?

28:56.440 --> 28:57.912
Any luck with Kalan Dhanna's phone?

28:57.912 --> 29:01.048
The network provider
is getting back to me.

29:01.048 --> 29:02.712
And the fingerprints on
the tea light?

29:02.712 --> 29:05.336
Nothing back yet.Did we get
the results back on the pigment?

29:05.336 --> 29:06.680
It turns out it's lipstick.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.984
I'm waiting on DNA from it.

29:08.984 --> 29:12.056
Candle wax and lipstick -
that's some kind of send-off.

29:12.056 --> 29:14.573
I do have the tox report.

29:15.640 --> 29:16.792
Ketamine.

29:16.792 --> 29:18.520
That's a popular party drug.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.992
And it's a popular research drug.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.533
Mainly because it's so versatile.

29:21.533 --> 29:25.253
Traces of formaldehyde
were also found in his system.

29:25.253 --> 29:28.696
Formaldehyde. What was he doing,
embalming himself?

29:28.696 --> 29:31.000
Is that what killed him?
It's pretty toxic stuff.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.304
Vecuronium bromide.

29:33.304 --> 29:36.893
Michael Jackson's last hit.
No, that's Propofol.

29:36.893 --> 29:40.493
Vecuronium bromide
is what anaesthetists use
to paralyse people.

29:40.493 --> 29:43.160
I gave up chemistry to do biology.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.592
You did biology?
In the broadest sense.

29:45.592 --> 29:47.960
Without ventilation
that would have killed him.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.840
It would have caused respiratory
depression and pulmonary oedema.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.632
It's also been to known
to be used in euthanasia

29:52.632 --> 29:54.488
and as a means of suicide.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.472
OK. How does that fit in
with his work?

29:56.472 --> 30:00.120
I think you should go
and speak to the CEO, Arthur Pujari.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.040
Oh, do you? That's not my call.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.280
When you go,
you need to take me with you.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.944
Is that so?

30:05.944 --> 30:07.096
I'd like to...

30:07.096 --> 30:08.760
...shake his hand again.

30:08.760 --> 30:13.304
I saw him give a talk at the end of
last year. He was just brilliant -

30:13.304 --> 30:16.760
one of these people who makes you
think anything is possible.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.488
I had a teacher like that at school.

30:18.488 --> 30:21.688
He was like, "Boys, you can
either do metalwork or woodwork."

30:21.688 --> 30:23.160
What an inspiration.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.773
Is she OK?

30:24.773 --> 30:27.960
I heard that, and no, I'm not.

30:29.624 --> 30:33.464
I'm not saying I'm a genius, but a
lot of other people are saying that.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.333
My friends keep telling me

30:35.333 --> 30:38.392
that we're close to
the Holy Grail of anaesthesia.

30:38.392 --> 30:41.813
We've perfected
the antagonism of the...

30:41.813 --> 30:44.693
Dictating his thesis
on his birthday!

30:44.693 --> 30:47.352
We're closer and closer to
a non-addictive pain killer

30:47.352 --> 30:50.744
and an end to
psychosomatic side effects...

30:54.136 --> 30:56.453
I told you to delete all that.

30:57.464 --> 31:00.536
Look at him. He was so happy.

31:02.392 --> 31:04.184
Where's Jacob?

31:11.933 --> 31:13.080
What happened that night?

31:14.360 --> 31:15.773
I told you.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.776
What is wrong with you?

31:26.933 --> 31:29.720
Jacob wanted to give Kalan
a proper send-off.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.813
It's the least he deserved.

31:42.968 --> 31:45.173
Do you think the police will
come back for more?

31:45.173 --> 31:46.680
No.

31:47.832 --> 31:49.432
Why did Kalan die?

31:51.416 --> 31:52.568
I don't know.

31:52.568 --> 31:53.720
Was it my fault?

31:55.192 --> 31:56.984
I gave him the drugs.

31:58.392 --> 32:00.504
His chest was convulsing.

32:00.504 --> 32:02.104
Shh. Hey.

32:02.104 --> 32:04.920
We can't just carry on
as if nothing has happened.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.568
How's it going?

32:16.568 --> 32:19.133
All smoke and mirrors if you ask me.

32:20.664 --> 32:23.608
I interviewed
some of Kalan Dhanna's friends

32:23.608 --> 32:25.400
and colleagues at
Pujari Pharmaceuticals.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.680
Oh, right?

32:26.680 --> 32:31.288
You know, when I interview someone
who is innocent, they make mistakes,

32:31.288 --> 32:35.384
they contradict themselves,
they can't remember something

32:35.384 --> 32:39.608
and then they do. It's normal,
but this clever lot, no mistakes.

32:39.608 --> 32:41.464
Word perfect.

32:41.464 --> 32:42.893
What does DI Briggs say?

32:42.893 --> 32:46.584
She doesn't say anything, because
I've got nothing really to tell her.

32:46.584 --> 32:50.104
That's why I'm here,
begging bowl at the ready.

32:50.104 --> 32:53.453
According to Clarissa
the lipstick on Kalan's forehead has

32:53.453 --> 32:56.120
someone's DNA on it
but they're not on the database.

32:56.120 --> 33:00.293
Let's try and get Kalan's friends
to give us a sample of their DNA -

33:00.293 --> 33:01.973
to help with the investigation.

33:01.973 --> 33:03.352
Good luck with that.

33:03.352 --> 33:04.632
What? You wouldn't do that?

33:04.632 --> 33:06.053
And trust you lot to look after it?

33:06.053 --> 33:08.280
Don't touch that.Or you lot.

33:10.136 --> 33:12.184
Pretty cool, right? Put it back.

33:15.064 --> 33:18.200
Kalan's phone is still active, so
all you have to do is track it down.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.888
And slightly less straightforward,
the tox report.

33:23.128 --> 33:24.536
Vecuronium...

33:24.536 --> 33:27.224
You wait till you hear
what it does to you.

33:27.224 --> 33:29.400
Why don't
we talk about this on the way?

33:29.400 --> 33:31.256
Going somewhere?Yes, we are.

33:31.256 --> 33:33.816
The gloves are out.

33:51.173 --> 33:53.144
Mr Pujari?

33:54.424 --> 33:57.560
Vail or Hodgson? DC Vail.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.184
Jack Hodgson.Hi.

34:00.184 --> 34:02.813
I'd shake your hands but, erm...

34:02.813 --> 34:05.453
You've come about Kalan Dhanna.

34:05.453 --> 34:08.312
Yeah. Is there somewhere
we can talk?

34:08.312 --> 34:10.232
That's a shame.

34:10.232 --> 34:15.096
He was a very fine scientist -
very fine brain - rare gift.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.632
You didn't know him personally?

34:16.632 --> 34:20.344
I employ some 2,000
people around the world.

34:20.344 --> 34:23.032
I try to take an interest in them,
you know,

34:23.032 --> 34:28.152
who's doing what, what
makes them tick, but...

34:29.880 --> 34:31.735
We'll talk in the house.

34:33.784 --> 34:38.840
The tree stump I've just pulled out,
     a couple of months ago,

34:38.840 --> 34:43.896
fine and healthy but then,
just one day, gave up.

34:45.431 --> 34:49.080
We tried everything - feeding,
pollarding, we even had some

34:49.080 --> 34:52.856
chaps up from Kew. I've got
all these laboratories around

34:52.856 --> 34:57.912
the world, employ some of
the finest minds...

34:58.552 --> 35:01.013
...but I can't save an old tree.

35:08.933 --> 35:12.440
Right, where shall we go?

35:15.653 --> 35:18.712
Excuse me, I'm just going to get
my stuff.Sure.

35:18.712 --> 35:22.744
Ah, in here.

35:22.744 --> 35:26.840
It's not where I thought,
but it'll do.

35:26.840 --> 35:30.053
Now, what I was told...

35:30.053 --> 35:35.032
Kalan came from
a small village in India.

35:36.773 --> 35:41.880
It used to take him
over three hours to get into Mumbai

35:42.072 --> 35:45.173
and then another three hours
just to get home,

35:45.173 --> 35:50.264
you know, fighting for a place on
one of those packed commuter trains.

35:50.776 --> 35:55.256
Then he got a scholarship
to Cambridge.

35:56.472 --> 35:59.352
People like Kalan are born,
not made.

36:01.528 --> 36:06.200
You know Kalan was found in a canal
not far from your London base.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.976
From what we understand
he was working on a new drug,

36:09.976 --> 36:13.304
but your lab manager was not keen
to share much more.

36:13.304 --> 36:14.584
I should hope not.

36:14.584 --> 36:19.512
It's all about money
and how much a new drug is worth.

36:20.813 --> 36:24.504
I'll find out what
he was working on for you.

36:24.504 --> 36:26.360
Thank you.

36:26.360 --> 36:30.840
I hear some of your research
scientists live near here?Mm.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.760
London prices are ridiculous,

36:32.760 --> 36:37.240
so I built a few houses
on the neighbouring land.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.224
And that's where Kalan was living.

36:39.224 --> 36:40.440
Well, as I told you,

36:40.440 --> 36:43.192
I have little or no day-to-day
running of the business.

36:43.192 --> 36:45.880
Which suits me fine. Do you play?

36:45.880 --> 36:47.672
Er, no.

36:47.672 --> 36:49.208
Ah.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.344
Neither do I. Looks good, though.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.752
Sir?

36:53.752 --> 36:55.800
Sorry, I'm going to have to go.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.640
Would you mind
if we had a look around?

36:59.640 --> 37:01.253
What, this house?

37:01.253 --> 37:04.312
No, the one where Kalan was living
with some of his colleagues.

37:04.312 --> 37:05.720
Can I stop you?

37:05.720 --> 37:07.973
Would you want to?

37:07.973 --> 37:10.013
No, course not.

37:10.013 --> 37:11.800
Anything to help.

37:11.800 --> 37:16.733
Binni will introduce you to someone
who'll show you where it is

37:17.432 --> 37:19.096
and walk you round.

37:32.792 --> 37:37.144
Please do come in.
Kalan's bedroom is upstairs.

37:41.304 --> 37:43.928
So... What
are you looking for, exactly?

37:44.952 --> 37:49.432
Do you know if Kalan took
recreational drugs of any kind?

37:49.432 --> 37:51.480
Cocaine, ketamine, opioids?

37:51.480 --> 37:54.040
Oh... No, I don't think so.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.600
Was he perhaps working with
these drugs?

37:56.600 --> 37:57.752
I don't know.

37:57.752 --> 37:59.736
I thought you two worked together.

37:59.736 --> 38:04.664
We have done, but recently he's
been following up his own research.

38:05.453 --> 38:07.864
Officially or something else?

38:07.864 --> 38:09.720
He never said.

38:16.632 --> 38:20.920
We're all encouraged to explore
and research wherever the work

38:20.920 --> 38:25.976
takes us. But, in the end,
results matter.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.456
They did to Kalan.

38:35.192 --> 38:38.456
Everyone's chasing
the next big thing.

38:38.456 --> 38:40.888
And was Kalan being chased?

38:40.888 --> 38:45.893
Kalan was a great guy.
Very loyal, very honest...

38:45.893 --> 38:48.760
Except he may have been sharing
his ideas with other companies?

38:48.760 --> 38:49.912
No.

38:51.960 --> 38:56.952
It was the pressure he was under -
everyone expected so much of him...

38:57.293 --> 38:59.384
...and he expected
so much more of himself.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.632
Do you think Kalan could have
taken his own life?

39:07.192 --> 39:09.304
I hope not.

39:10.853 --> 39:14.104
I'll be downstairs
if you need anything more.

39:14.104 --> 39:16.792
Is Jenna Hong around?

39:16.792 --> 39:18.392
No.

39:18.392 --> 39:21.016
She's not here right now.

39:24.173 --> 39:27.736
What do you think?
More smoke and mirrors?

39:27.736 --> 39:29.272
He sounded convincing.

39:29.272 --> 39:31.192
Maybe the DI's right.

39:31.192 --> 39:33.624
It's exactly what it looks like.

39:38.296 --> 39:40.792
All done?Yeah.

39:42.392 --> 39:47.256
Can I ask - your researchers -
how much is expected of them?

39:48.173 --> 39:53.213
If, as I suspect, you believe Kalan
took his own life, I would hope

39:54.488 --> 39:59.032
we did everything
we possibly could to help him.

39:59.032 --> 40:03.064
We try and take care of everyone
we employ. I mean, we want them

40:03.064 --> 40:06.712
to explore and develop new drugs,

40:06.712 --> 40:09.173
new ideas which we can follow up.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.600
As far as I understand,

40:12.600 --> 40:16.440
Kalan was working
on a non-addictive painkiller,

40:16.440 --> 40:19.320
which would have changed
the lives of millions of people.

40:19.320 --> 40:22.072
And what drugs would
he have been working with?

40:22.072 --> 40:24.184
I'm not sure, exactly,

40:24.184 --> 40:29.176
but I understand he was working with
ketamine, which is hugely versatile.

40:29.176 --> 40:31.672
And would he have been
taking that drug himself?

40:31.672 --> 40:34.744
I wouldn't have thought so.
It was in the early stages.

40:34.744 --> 40:38.072
Why?
Did you find ketamine in his body?

40:38.072 --> 40:41.656
That's not something
I can divulge at the moment.

40:41.656 --> 40:46.328
I'm sure you know - suicide is
one of the highest causes of death

40:46.328 --> 40:49.144
amongst young men
in the western world.

40:50.168 --> 40:51.832
Has his family been informed?

40:51.832 --> 40:53.304
Yes.

40:53.304 --> 40:58.040
Well, if there's anything
I, or my company, can do to help...

40:58.040 --> 41:01.304
Thanks very much, Mr Pujari,
we'll be in touch.

41:01.304 --> 41:03.032
I hope not!

41:03.032 --> 41:04.632
No, just joking.

41:04.632 --> 41:07.064
You and Mr Hodgson
are welcome any time.

41:07.064 --> 41:08.280
Open house.

41:21.976 --> 41:24.920
Hi. I know the last couple of days
has not been easy...

41:24.920 --> 41:26.968
Is Nikki not coming?

41:26.968 --> 41:29.592
She's gone home.You sent her home?

41:29.592 --> 41:31.320
No, no, of course not.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.200
Thomas is doing a PM
on PC Steven Francis.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.800
Nikki thought it best to go home.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.336
All right.

41:37.336 --> 41:41.368
Yeah, she also needs time to
prepare for the courtroom appeal.

41:41.368 --> 41:43.613
Which is all she needs.
Another day in court.

41:43.613 --> 41:45.848
Look, I have every faith in Nikki.

41:45.848 --> 41:49.048
You know that. We both believe
in the science, but as a precaution

41:49.048 --> 41:51.928
I've asked Professor Long to review
all the procedures at Chesham...

41:51.928 --> 41:53.656
I bet she loved that.

41:53.656 --> 41:56.408
...and I promised that
we would do the same here.

41:56.408 --> 41:57.653
What?

41:57.653 --> 42:00.312
Whatever happens with
this third postmortem,

42:00.312 --> 42:02.680
an investigation's almost
certainly on the cards.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.493
Come on, Jack.
We need to be prepared.

42:06.653 --> 42:07.864
OK.

42:19.384 --> 42:21.432
Amanda. Hi.

42:39.672 --> 42:44.024
I've been told that formaldehyde
has been found in Kalan's body.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.632
Why would any of us
inject ourselves with formaldehyde?

42:48.632 --> 42:50.813
Hmm.

42:50.813 --> 42:54.520
The Lyell's in all sorts of trouble
over conflicting PMs

42:54.520 --> 42:56.952
and dubious tox reports.

42:56.952 --> 43:00.024
You think Kalan's body
was contaminated?

43:00.024 --> 43:03.416
I think science is
a wonderful thing.

43:05.912 --> 43:07.960
How close are you?

43:09.112 --> 43:12.184
We're ready for the next stage.

43:12.184 --> 43:14.360
One more trial.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.832
Just to be sure.

43:16.856 --> 43:18.904
Who should go next?

43:18.904 --> 43:20.952
Your choice.

43:50.776 --> 43:52.632
Breathing is stable.

43:52.632 --> 43:54.680
Commencing the pain testing.

43:57.304 --> 43:59.864
We need to stop the infusion.

43:59.864 --> 44:01.272
He needs ventilation.

44:05.432 --> 44:07.160
What are you watching it for?

44:09.272 --> 44:10.680
We all saw him die.

44:10.680 --> 44:13.133
Why?

44:13.133 --> 44:17.784
We were comparing the effects
of the trial drug with the placebo

44:17.784 --> 44:19.640
and the standard drug.

44:20.984 --> 44:24.504
Why, after all this time, has
Kalan's body reacted like that?

44:24.504 --> 44:27.533
It's like his whole body
was suddenly paralysed.

44:28.792 --> 44:32.632
You can look at the videos,
the data...

44:32.632 --> 44:35.384
But it doesn't change anything.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.736
We need to continue
with the receptive tests.

44:42.552 --> 44:44.984
What if one of us
reacts like Kalan did?

44:47.480 --> 44:49.016
Are you willing to risk your life?

44:49.016 --> 44:50.693
We all agreed.

44:50.693 --> 44:53.240
Speed up this process,
to get this drug to market,

44:53.240 --> 44:54.584
we'd test on ourselves.

44:54.584 --> 44:55.864
I didn't agree to die.

44:55.864 --> 44:57.413
And neither did Kalan.

44:57.413 --> 44:59.453
What choice do we have, Jacob?

44:59.453 --> 45:02.333
If we go to the police
and tell them the truth,

45:02.333 --> 45:03.992
we'll be charged with murder.

45:03.992 --> 45:07.576
And if we don't keep going,
you know what will happen.

45:33.112 --> 45:34.973
So, Caucasian.

45:34.973 --> 45:36.824
Male.

45:36.824 --> 45:39.064
Aged 23.

45:41.496 --> 45:44.952
This is the third postmortem
after conflicting

45:44.952 --> 45:48.664
reports from Dr Long at Chesham
and Dr Alexander at the Lyell.

45:52.312 --> 45:55.512
There's disagreement
among pathologists about

45:55.512 --> 45:58.200
whether conducting a second or third
     postmortem on the body

45:58.200 --> 46:01.853
is helpful at all due to
the natural decomposition...

46:13.973 --> 46:15.800
Bear in mind that
such an exercise is

46:15.800 --> 46:18.053
only as good as
the photographs that were taken.

46:18.053 --> 46:21.240
So if an injury or finding
was not seen

46:21.240 --> 46:23.288
and therefore not photographed...

46:28.024 --> 46:32.888
The original examination found every
single relevant injury or finding.

46:34.936 --> 46:38.584
I strongly believe it's useful
to re-examine the body,

46:38.584 --> 46:41.400
even if it's only to
satisfy my own peace of mind.

47:12.056 --> 47:16.920
14th May, 2018, 9am.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.736
This is the body of Steven Francis.

47:19.736 --> 47:21.592
Caucasian male, aged 23.

47:23.512 --> 47:28.568
61.7 kilos, 173 centimetres.

47:30.552 --> 47:35.224
There are abrasions and bruises
to the face, neck,

47:35.224 --> 47:37.208
and side of the head.

47:37.208 --> 47:40.152
Looking at PC Francis now

47:40.152 --> 47:42.776
and photographic evidence

47:42.776 --> 47:44.952
from when he first came in,

47:44.952 --> 47:49.944
I can see obvious signs of facial
trauma, effemetus abrasions

47:49.944 --> 47:51.893
and bruises to the face...

47:54.104 --> 47:55.512
...side of the head.

47:56.984 --> 47:59.352
His nose appears to be fractured.

48:01.144 --> 48:02.872
There is some bruising

48:02.872 --> 48:06.136
and cuts to the hands and arms...

48:07.736 --> 48:10.296
...suggesting that he was trying
to defend himself.

48:10.296 --> 48:13.432
Further bruising to the chest,
to the lower abdomen.

48:13.432 --> 48:16.253
And what looks like significant

48:16.253 --> 48:18.296
blunt trauma to the left

48:18.296 --> 48:19.832
costal margin

48:19.832 --> 48:23.160
and lower ribs, laterally.

48:25.208 --> 48:28.024
Evidence of fracture on palpation.

48:28.024 --> 48:30.904
All of that's
pretty much as expected.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.552
Better bring me the heart.

48:36.053 --> 48:39.032
On first examination
the valve looks gelatinous.

48:39.032 --> 48:40.973
See?Yes.

48:40.973 --> 48:42.893
Possible Mitral Valve
Prolapse Syndrome.

48:42.893 --> 48:46.520
We'll need to send some histology.

49:05.272 --> 49:06.424
Well?

49:06.424 --> 49:09.304
There's no sign of disease.
Professor Long's report is right.

49:09.304 --> 49:11.672
You're sure?I wish I weren't.

49:11.672 --> 49:13.720
There must be
some other explanation.

49:13.720 --> 49:14.744
No.

49:16.216 --> 49:18.072
Nikki got it wrong.

49:18.072 --> 49:19.480
God.

49:31.013 --> 49:32.152
Thomas.

49:32.152 --> 49:33.816
Nikki, Nikki, hi.

49:33.816 --> 49:35.933
Would it be possible for you
to come in to the Lyell?

49:35.933 --> 49:37.272
What did you find?

49:37.272 --> 49:39.533
I think we should talk about it
face-to-face, don't you?

49:39.533 --> 49:40.984
No. Tell me.

49:40.984 --> 49:44.120
Perhaps I could come over to you?

49:47.896 --> 49:49.560
You didn't find anything.

49:52.853 --> 49:55.256
No. No, we didn't.

49:55.256 --> 49:58.264
I thought maybe
we could look at it together.

49:59.693 --> 50:02.360
No. I clearly made a mistake.

50:04.024 --> 50:05.176
Well...

50:06.520 --> 50:08.632
It's the only
conclusion there is, Thomas.

50:08.632 --> 50:11.640
Jack and Clarissa have gone through
all the procedures here

50:11.640 --> 50:14.008
and they've done the same
at Chesham, so...

50:15.293 --> 50:18.360
...so, yeah, the implication is...

50:18.360 --> 50:21.176
Thank you for phoning, Thomas.

50:23.224 --> 50:25.272
Let me have some time, OK?

50:25.272 --> 50:27.448
Yes, of course.

50:27.448 --> 50:29.333
The trial reconvenes on Monday.

50:33.912 --> 50:35.768
Nikki?

50:46.456 --> 50:48.440
We've started the infusion.

50:50.872 --> 50:54.520
Breathing is stable.

50:54.520 --> 50:57.080
Commencing the pain testing.

51:00.216 --> 51:01.432
No response.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.152
Anything?

51:29.592 --> 51:30.893
What's happening?

51:30.893 --> 51:34.904
Why's he so tachycardic?
Richard? Richard?

51:34.904 --> 51:36.376
We need to stop the infusion.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.792
0.15 milligrams per kilogram
as usual.

51:42.072 --> 51:43.800
I'm stopping this.

51:54.296 --> 51:56.792
Have you added another drug
to the testing protocol?

51:56.792 --> 51:59.800
If that happened,
it's got nothing to do with me.

52:02.573 --> 52:03.960
Richard?

52:05.496 --> 52:06.840
Richard?

52:06.840 --> 52:08.504
Richard?

52:08.504 --> 52:11.704
These trials we've been doing
are secrets, yes?

52:11.704 --> 52:13.560
What exactly are we testing here?

52:14.712 --> 52:17.080
I thought it was
a non-addictive pain killer.

52:17.080 --> 52:19.576
Why's it causing these convulsions?

52:20.933 --> 52:22.648
Is this what killed Kalan?

52:25.400 --> 52:27.320
Tell me.

52:30.413 --> 52:32.824
Tell me or I go to the police.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.720
What are you doing?

53:05.720 --> 53:08.792
Sorry to drag you in at a weekend.

53:08.792 --> 53:12.376
Look, I need you to be
an impartial witness.

53:12.376 --> 53:13.613
Don't ask.

53:13.613 --> 53:16.408
I just want you to record everything
that I'm about to do.

53:16.408 --> 53:17.560
OK?

53:19.736 --> 53:21.592
OK.

53:21.592 --> 53:22.808
Thank you.

53:27.224 --> 53:29.272
Don't look so worried.

53:29.272 --> 53:32.093
This is all my responsibility.

53:32.093 --> 53:36.632
Right, see this? This is
the body of PC Steven Francis.

53:36.632 --> 53:41.368
Evidence number LY-SF-63418.

53:41.368 --> 53:43.032
Right?Right.

53:53.272 --> 53:55.320
I'm removing a hair sample
from the body.

53:58.072 --> 54:00.773
Isn't that tampering with evidence?

54:02.424 --> 54:04.024
No. I need to prove something.

54:35.960 --> 54:39.352
And this is the heart
belonging to PC Steven Francis,

54:39.352 --> 54:43.448
evidence number: LY-SF-63418.

54:43.448 --> 54:45.893
Yes?Yes.

54:58.253 --> 55:00.293
I did not make a mistake.

55:06.173 --> 55:08.024
Is that a suicide note?

55:08.024 --> 55:11.032
Even if it is a suicide note,
that doesn't mean it's a suicide.

55:11.032 --> 55:14.936
Do you agree this was a deliberate
act? An act of sabotage?

55:14.936 --> 55:16.920
As Miss World says,

55:16.920 --> 55:21.208
"All I want is world peace and
global access to free health care."

55:23.704 --> 55:25.688
What are these brilliant
young men doing?

55:25.688 --> 55:28.504
Putting all this shit
into their bodies.

55:28.504 --> 55:31.384
I wanted to tell the truth
but Pujari wouldn't let me.

55:31.384 --> 55:32.920
Does Jenna know all this?

55:32.920 --> 55:35.608
The less people who know the better.

55:35.608 --> 55:38.616
If the Lyell's at fault I'll be the
first to take full responsibility.

55:38.616 --> 55:41.240
Yeah, cos you're
so bloody good at that, aren't you?

55:41.240 --> 55:43.864
Amanda, we have to keep our personal
    relationship out of this.

55:43.864 --> 55:48.472
Course, we must. Must be
professional, above all else.

55:48.472 --> 55:50.648
This whole thing has been staged.

55:50.648 --> 55:52.184
Are you going to behave yourself?

55:52.184 --> 55:53.272
What do you think?

55:53.272 --> 55:55.013
So, we need more?

55:55.013 --> 55:56.856
When have we ever needed less?

55:56.856 --> 55:58.520
This is out of control.

56:00.312 --> 56:01.912
What do you think that means?

56:01.912 --> 56:03.653
I'm not sure.

56:03.653 --> 56:05.112
Yet.

56:05.112 --> 56:10.232
 Testator Silens

56:14.392 --> 56:19.512
 Costestes e spiritu

56:21.944 --> 56:27.000
 Silentium.
