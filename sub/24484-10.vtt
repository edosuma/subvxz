WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.800
Round-trip, how long?

00:07.842 --> 00:11.387
Walker could have hustled here
and back inside of 20 minutes.

00:11.429 --> 00:14.181
I chased a suspect into
that old Red Car depot once.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.225
I thought
the tunnels were blocked off.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.476
Well, they are.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.730
Right here, below Angels Flight.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.357
By these foundations
they sunk in

00:23.399 --> 00:26.402
to put up these glass castles.

00:27.403 --> 00:30.239
This is the old emergency exit.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.576
Where I came up.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.661
Check it out.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.788
Huh.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.626
We still need hard evidence,
Harry.

00:42.668 --> 00:46.213
I think he ditched the gun
on his walk back,

00:46.255 --> 00:48.799
then busted up
the aforementioned burner phone

00:48.841 --> 00:50.384
he used to text Elias with.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.677
Phone, gun--

00:51.719 --> 00:53.554
two very different things.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.890
Got to put the nine
in Walker's hand.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.893
Anything less than that,
that pussy O'Shea,

00:58.934 --> 01:00.144
he'll punt.

01:04.273 --> 01:06.233
-Bosch.
-Bosch,

01:06.275 --> 01:08.694
Moy. We think
we found our shooter.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.572
You have people inside?

01:11.614 --> 01:13.282
Yeah. No sign of him.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.201
But his vehicle's
still parked out back.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.869
What's he doing here?

01:16.911 --> 01:18.871
Got a tip
our suspect's been laying low

01:18.913 --> 01:19.955
at his girlfriend's.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.957
Hit the door, but he was gone.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.959
Girl said Eddie got a call
around noon,

01:24.001 --> 01:26.796
borrowed her car, texted two
hours later he was hanging here.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.130
Meeting somebody.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.673
Got support so we can go in?

01:29.715 --> 01:32.885
Yeah, but this is
a follow-away caper, Bosch.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.929
He's one guy.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.472
You play pool?

01:36.514 --> 01:38.682
Always wanted to learn.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.893
Bosch! Shit!

02:01.831 --> 02:04.792
Hands up! Turn around!
Face the wall.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.168
-Move to the table!
-

02:06.210 --> 02:07.837
Now! Let's go!

02:14.969 --> 02:16.762
-What's he saying?
-Beats me.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.181
Cut it out.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.267
I know you speak English.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.231
Huh?

02:27.273 --> 02:29.650
Turn around.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.114
That's not Chinese.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.991
You're making
a fool of yourself.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.494
This one.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.787
Was he here?

02:44.081 --> 02:45.583
They were or they weren't.
Yes or no.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.377
Eddie was here.

02:48.419 --> 02:51.547
Then the other man came in,
solo.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.424
They didn't talk.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.343
After a while,
the other guy goes out back.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.221
Few minutes later,
Eddie says he's going home.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.359
This the girlfriend's ride?

03:12.401 --> 03:13.819
Yeah.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.621
Clear.

03:28.626 --> 03:29.877
Harry.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.676
Get one of your guys
to pop the hatch.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.315
Someone's cleaning house.

03:51.357 --> 03:53.484
Yeah.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.862
This guy's arrogance
is unbelievable.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.785
This is Bosch.
Still got eyes on Shiwei Chen?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.203
Hold him.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.499
There's the gate.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.588
Assholes.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.508
Bosch!

04:18.300 --> 04:20.636
Hey...

04:20.678 --> 04:22.888
-Bosch!
-Hey! Hey!

04:22.930 --> 04:25.432
Hey!

04:25.474 --> 04:28.102
Can't let you do it, Harry.
Can't even let him see you.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.979
This guy's responsible
for at least two murders!

04:30.020 --> 04:31.563
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.171
Nah, it's all taken care of.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.215
No.

04:58.257 --> 05:01.635
I got it all covered.
Yep. Okay.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.138
Let 'em go.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.266
Come on, give us
some space.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.312
-Who is he?
-Just what he said.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.982
High-level MSS agent,
consular cover.

05:15.024 --> 05:17.151
Son of some party bigwig.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.319
A princeling,
corrupt or gone rogue.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.864
He was running
a money dump from China.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.283
Parking cash in local banks
for God knows what kind

05:24.324 --> 05:25.868
-of financial terror.
-You just let him walk?

05:25.909 --> 05:28.037
Fly. And no, we didn't.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.496
I don't think the president
could have kept Chen here

05:29.538 --> 05:31.665
without an international
incident.

05:31.707 --> 05:32.916
We tail him back to Shanghai,

05:32.958 --> 05:34.626
see who he answers to
back there.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.128
When his bosses realize

05:36.170 --> 05:38.172
how completely he's failed
and exposed them, then...

05:38.213 --> 05:40.549
Whatever they do to him
is worse than anything

05:40.591 --> 05:42.593
you or I could ever imagine.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.720
And that offers comfort to me

05:47.514 --> 05:50.559
Eleanor Wish was instrumental
in bringing down

05:50.601 --> 05:52.227
a major foreign threat
to our country.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.104
She gave her life for it.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.647
I should think that's something
that you'd want to honor.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.858
You assholes got her killed.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.693
Whoa! Bosch!

05:59.735 --> 06:01.612
Ow.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.447
Okay, stop!

06:03.489 --> 06:05.074
Stop. Let him go.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.619
Son of a bitch.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.457
Okay, I don't blame you.

06:13.499 --> 06:16.835
So I'm gonna let
this one slide.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.339
Get him out of my sight.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.343
Come on.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.811
You're wrong.

06:33.852 --> 06:37.231
Griffin put his reputation
on the line for her.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.942
-What is this?
-If I'm wrong,

06:39.983 --> 06:42.069
this is your boss' phone, you
can just give it back to him.

06:42.111 --> 06:45.489
But if I'm right,
you'll find that he sent a photo

06:45.531 --> 06:46.907
that Eleanor took
at the poker game

06:46.949 --> 06:49.535
and gave it to
a Chinese intermediary...

06:49.576 --> 06:52.246
who exposed it to the man
who had Eleanor killed.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.377
We found his number
on Eleanor's cell.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.962
Backtracked the texts
from the call log.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.463
Maybe he didn't realize
how dangerous

07:01.505 --> 07:03.257
Chen was when he sent it,

07:03.298 --> 07:06.218
but Griffin poked a hornets'
nest to see what flew out.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.345
It was two assassins
on a motorcycle.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.389
This is fucked up.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.184
I don't know about you, Chuck,
but for me...

07:14.226 --> 07:15.602
a special agent like that

07:15.644 --> 07:19.189
shouldn't be in charge
of anything.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.654
- -

08:07.696 --> 08:09.573
- -

08:13.660 --> 08:14.912
- -

08:42.773 --> 08:44.983
Are
you gonna go after him?

08:48.570 --> 08:51.406
The Feds said the Chinese
government will take care of it.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.955
Do you believe them?

08:57.996 --> 09:01.083
His cover's blown, he's exposed
a covert operation

09:01.124 --> 09:04.294
and everyone connected to it.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.963
I want to.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.299
It's impossible to say
for sure.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.343
But the guys who...

09:11.385 --> 09:13.512
They're dead.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.392
I don't want you
going anywhere for a while.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.770
Same here.

09:37.828 --> 09:40.205
How did you figure out
she was here?

09:42.582 --> 09:43.959
City has a ledger
with a list of names

09:44.001 --> 09:45.961
of unclaimed dead.

09:46.003 --> 09:50.882
Goes back more than
a hundred years.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.428
They keep the ashes
for a while.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.972
Nobody shows up
to pay the fee...

09:57.014 --> 09:59.433
Sacred ground.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.020
Yeah.

10:05.314 --> 10:09.192
Still... I'd rather be
anywhere but here.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.323
So it goes, Mads.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.785
So it goes.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.773
Hey.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.068
I can't take them
at all today-- I'm sorry.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.364
-All right.
-Task force.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.532
We're scrambling
on a new lead.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.784
I'll make it up
to you tonight.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.453
Don't. Don't do that.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.706
-Do what? -Make a promise
you might break.

11:04.748 --> 11:08.543
We've been there.
I don't want to go back.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.254
It'd be a lot easier
if we were in the same house.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.506
I'll go tell 'em.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.216
No.

11:16.635 --> 11:20.055
Let's just get this out instead
of dancing around it.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.810
Jerry, I'm not interested
in getting back together.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.311
We are back together.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.688
When we want to be.
When we don't,

11:28.730 --> 11:30.065
you have your life,
I have mine.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.944
What kind of a family
is that?

11:33.985 --> 11:36.405
What kind was it
when you slept around

11:36.446 --> 11:37.614
and got us divorced
to begin with?

11:40.742 --> 11:43.286
-I didn't mean it like that.
-Yes, you did.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.622
Sorry.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.290
We're good, J.

11:47.332 --> 11:51.294
Here's where we are,
and I like how we are.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.424
If this is about my work,
I told you...

11:55.465 --> 11:57.884
No, you want to quit,
go ahead.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.428
It's not gonna change
how I feel.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.804
You don't know that.

12:00.846 --> 12:03.849
The cop is who you are.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.893
It's why I love you, and why I
can't be with you all the time.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.354
What if I want more?

12:11.857 --> 12:15.152
I'll be sad.
But I've been sad before.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.825
-We still have kids to raise.
-

12:21.867 --> 12:25.287
In each other's lives,
this way or another.

12:27.456 --> 12:30.625
Go on, Jerry.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.961
Be safe, and let me know
when you come up for air.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.716
Whatever you decide.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.821
When you're old and lonely,
you'll be begging me

12:59.863 --> 13:02.699
-to drive you everywhere.
-There's Uber.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.910
You have that rule about
not paying for anything

13:04.951 --> 13:06.203
with your phone.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.621
Taxis still take cash.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.916
Yeah, sure. Somebody's got
to keep them in business.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.378
I'm going.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.172
Chapman.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.632
I told them.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.803
It was Mom who made me apply,
but I'm going because I want to.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.141
What I think doesn't factor?

13:28.183 --> 13:30.185
I know what you think.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.270
Usually.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.022
You're in a language
that I understand.

13:34.064 --> 13:37.192
I guess that's a compliment.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.821
Don't get all weepy on me, Dad.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.492
How old are your kids?

13:45.534 --> 13:47.494
Seven, five and one.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.162
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.455
Ah.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.083
Ooh, that's a lot of food.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.709
You know, you don't think of
salmon croquettes

13:54.751 --> 13:56.795
as a breakfast meat,
but on a bad day

13:56.836 --> 13:58.630
these babies make me smile.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.131
You got a lot of bad days?

14:01.841 --> 14:04.844
Homicides are down.

14:04.886 --> 14:08.014
Assaults, property crimes
are up.

14:08.056 --> 14:11.017
Our clearance rate
could be better.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.394
We're not glamorous,
like Hollywood,

14:12.435 --> 14:13.770
but we get the job done.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.730
Might want to bring some people.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.650
Couple of D-one spots
opening up.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.443
Just got to schedule the oral.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.947
I know there's some dust
in my past, but...

14:23.989 --> 14:26.741
It's mostly a formality
at this point,

14:26.783 --> 14:28.785
considering the glowing rec
we got on you.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.955
Billets. I'll miss her.

14:31.997 --> 14:34.082
She's top-drawer.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.834
It was Terry Drake put you
over the top.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.504
Yeah, he said RHD made a huge
mistake not taking you.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.633
Drake.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.094
Any problem you coming on
next month?

15:05.864 --> 15:07.782
You promised us

15:07.824 --> 15:10.035
Bosch wouldn't flinch
if it came to charging a cop.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.495
Bosch can't force the DA
to file.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.373
Maybe it's time to consider
letting another detective

15:15.415 --> 15:17.083
take the lead on this.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.045
And what would you have him
do differently?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.713
Been there, done that, Irv.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.089
I've been talking
to the other commissioners,

15:23.131 --> 15:25.008
-and we...
-I'm told immigration

15:25.050 --> 15:27.260
found our River Watch arson
suspect yesterday.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.679
Bondigas... on your job site.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.139
Anonymous tip.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.599
Your detectives must be pleased.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.142
Well, they never got
to talk to him.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.687
Expedited deportation
of known felons.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.857
Well, at least he won't

15:40.899 --> 15:42.400
be committing
any more crimes up here.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.027
No, he won't.

15:45.904 --> 15:49.157
Only a handful of people knew
we were looking for him.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.827
And LAPD doesn't share business
with ICE.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.955
You shared it with me.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.501
Yes, I did.

15:59.542 --> 16:03.463
Irv, immigration is picking up
criminals every day.

16:03.505 --> 16:07.384
When Detective Bosch does
bring his case to the DA,

16:07.425 --> 16:11.346
whoever he determines did this,
it will stick.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.890
Rest assured.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.642
May be too late for the city.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.352
The city will survive.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.896
You, me, the mayor...

16:19.938 --> 16:22.315
we're just passing through.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.817
And Bosch?

16:23.858 --> 16:26.152
The city could use more
like him.

16:26.194 --> 16:30.240
I wish I had your confidence
in his abilities.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.661
No, you don't.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.469
Not sure how late
we'll work tonight.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.138
Did Jerry leave you a copy
of Mom's phone stuff?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.473
Actually, I know he did,

16:55.515 --> 16:57.475
because I heard
you two talking.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.060
What about it?

16:59.102 --> 17:01.479
Can I go through it?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.064
Pictures...

17:03.106 --> 17:05.191
I don't know-- messages.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.402
There might be something there
she didn't want you to see.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.571
She didn't want me
to see her dead.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.659
That came out wrong.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.453
And I don't think so.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.788
I lived with her
a lot longer than you.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.250
Yeah, you did.

17:22.292 --> 17:24.794
-There's a flash drive.
-I know where it is.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.214
Detective work.

17:28.256 --> 17:31.092
I didn't want to take it
without asking.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.052
Appreciate that.

17:34.804 --> 17:35.889
Love you.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.265
Love you back.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.164
No justice, no peace!

18:01.206 --> 18:06.085
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

18:06.127 --> 18:07.754
No justice, no peace!

18:07.796 --> 18:10.006
No justice,
no peace!

18:10.048 --> 18:13.676
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

18:13.718 --> 18:15.929
No justice, no peace!

18:15.970 --> 18:17.889
No justice,
no peace!

18:17.931 --> 18:21.601
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

18:24.687 --> 18:26.648
Damn it.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.862
Mayor Ramos is coming
to the protest.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.697
I just got the call.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.075
Bet the chief is thrilled
about that.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.244
Irving woke me up this morning.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.246
He's already walking back
his stake in this.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.998
-Elias?
-Walker.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.167
Chief likes to play a long game.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.794
You don't do this by the book,
Harry,

18:47.836 --> 18:49.504
it's not just your neck,
it's gonna be mine.

18:49.546 --> 18:52.131
Now you're talking like a real
captain, Lieutenant.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.551
And you're talking like
man about to let

18:54.592 --> 18:56.636
a personal vendetta destroy
his career.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.221
Well, I guess we'll just
have to see

18:58.263 --> 18:59.806
how that shakes out, won't we?

19:04.102 --> 19:05.854
Shit.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.734
-Pierce, Task Force gets a pass
on the unis today. -I know.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.611
But my patrol buddies
are on the line today.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.613
If you can spare me in here, I'd
like to be out there with them.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.740
You talk to your partner
about it?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.285
No answer;
don't know where he is.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.786
I left word.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.663
Okay. When it's over, just...

19:23.705 --> 19:24.914
I will.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.458
-Thanks, Harry.
-Sure.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.600
Good morning.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.106
You going through
that stuff again?

19:52.775 --> 19:54.861
Where would a man who likes
to keep things close keep

19:54.903 --> 19:57.614
the most important thing
he's had in a long, long time?

21:06.808 --> 21:08.017
Ms. Cooke?

21:08.059 --> 21:09.769
Hi. Jun Park.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.271
Chief Irving sends his
apologies, he won't be coming.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.482
-Oh. Okay.
-Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

21:14.524 --> 21:15.942
No. I should get going.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.819
I'm covering
the protest in Hollywood.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.779
-I don't want to be... -N-No,
they make great coffee here.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.447
Irvin said that you like
a cappuccino,

21:21.489 --> 21:23.992
so I, uh, took the liberty
of ordering you one.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.119
And how...

21:26.160 --> 21:28.162
how would he know that?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.047
Can I ask exactly what
your relationship with...

21:38.089 --> 21:41.259
So what I'm about to tell you
is, of course,

21:41.300 --> 21:42.885
not for attribution,

21:42.927 --> 21:44.762
but you can consider it
well-informed.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.222
Would you mind turning off
your phone?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.059
So much for the chief
trusting me.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.811
He wants to trust you.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.563
He likes to be cautious.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.691
First thing.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.696
You should look into whether the
mayor and the police commission

22:01.738 --> 22:03.281
are applying pressure to remove

22:03.322 --> 22:04.782
the lead detective
from the Elias case.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.659
Why?

22:06.701 --> 22:09.662
The evidence doesn't add up
to Sheehan committing the crime.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.664
And LAPD won't file charges
on an innocent man.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.583
Not for attribution.

22:13.624 --> 22:14.917
Second thing.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.836
You might want to start
doing background

22:16.878 --> 22:19.756
on the cozy relationship between
Bradley Walker and the mayor.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.552
Campaign contributions,
building variances.

22:24.594 --> 22:27.305
Favorable treatment.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.767
It's all in the public record,
if you know where to look.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.149
But somehow tied together
by the Elias case?

22:38.191 --> 22:40.359
You're the reporter.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.612
You haven't tried your coffee.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.247
Mmm.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.249
This is good.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.752
Yeah.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.800
-What do you want?
-Uh, give me diet.

23:03.841 --> 23:06.886
-Diet. -Yeah.
-Think his mom fixed it.

23:06.928 --> 23:10.056
Hey, listen, my apologies
for Angel's Flight.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.225
I was dead wrong about that.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.228
All right, well,
apology accepted.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.772
And I'm not the kind of man
that holds a grudge.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.732
Yeah, you and Bosch had
that sixth sense

23:19.774 --> 23:21.359
that Sheehan didn't
kill the man.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.568
I didn't trust it.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.278
Yeah, well...

23:24.320 --> 23:26.155
...here's to hoping
that that's the only thing

23:26.197 --> 23:27.907
I have in common
with Harry Bosch.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.327
Red, green.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.454
feliz Navidad.

23:33.496 --> 23:34.664
They call it Christmas.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.295
I wasn't
a very good partner, was I?

23:41.337 --> 23:44.048
Eh, you did right by me.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.135
Now you're gonna get
your three-spot at Newton.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.386
Run your own unit.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.556
Terry, I got to ask,
back at Rampart,

23:51.597 --> 23:53.558
when you got caught up
and flipped,

23:53.599 --> 23:56.811
gave testimony against Perez
and the others...

23:56.853 --> 23:58.771
Bad cops.

23:58.813 --> 24:01.149
I don't lose
a wink of sleep over it.

24:01.190 --> 24:04.527
Yeah, but what made you so damn
sure I would cover for you?

24:04.569 --> 24:06.070
Even when everyone
started to say

24:06.112 --> 24:07.613
that it was me who was the rat.

24:07.655 --> 24:11.033
It's the character of a man
I value most.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.201
And you can pick them.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.453
Me.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.622
Sheehan.

24:16.664 --> 24:20.251
Yeah, well, he paid a terrible
price for a thing he didn't do.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.460
Black Guardian?

24:21.502 --> 24:24.172
He says he did.

24:24.213 --> 24:28.551
The gospel according
to Harry Bosch?

24:28.593 --> 24:31.679
Elias had a video of what
went down in the bathroom.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.932
Hidden camera.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.397
All these years, telling myself
you were different

24:41.439 --> 24:45.234
than the Rampart guys
you ratted out.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.903
I was dumb.

24:46.944 --> 24:50.489
That's what I'm most sorry for.

24:50.531 --> 24:54.619
If I'd've turned you in,
maybe none of this ever happens.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.673
You see this?

25:09.258 --> 25:11.886
-RHD must be pissed.
-Tough shit.

25:11.928 --> 25:14.430
Crate and Barrel have been
walking that road a long time.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.474
You talk to the jury consultant?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.850
Ms. Duncan remembers Elias

25:17.892 --> 25:19.560
started wearing the ring
a few weeks ago.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.688
Told her it was a reminder
of the man he wanted to be.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.232
You mind if I...?

25:24.273 --> 25:25.274
How are we doing?

25:25.316 --> 25:26.692
Stuck.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.572
Got a minute?

25:31.614 --> 25:33.866
Sure.

25:33.908 --> 25:35.534
L.T. too lazy
to poke her head in?

25:37.536 --> 25:38.537
She's in war mode.

25:44.126 --> 25:48.297
This really doesn't even look
like a piece of jewelry.

25:48.339 --> 25:51.467
The bevel, here, on the inside?

25:51.509 --> 25:52.760
It's just weird.

25:54.428 --> 25:55.596
Come in.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.056
Close the door.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.902
Has Bosch told you what's been
going on with Walker?

26:09.944 --> 26:11.529
I mean, not this case.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.698
Last three months.
While you were out.

26:22.290 --> 26:26.335
Well, what does that mean,

26:26.377 --> 26:27.628
Mr. I-Don't-Believe-
In-Coincidence?

26:40.266 --> 26:41.225
What?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.518
You got a quarter on you?

26:57.241 --> 26:58.868
Mine's newer.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.369
They put the states
on the back now

27:00.411 --> 27:01.704
instead of the eagle.

27:05.041 --> 27:07.960
Front and back,
the design should match up.

27:08.002 --> 27:11.339
Vertical symmetry.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.633
Top, bottom.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.724
Back and front are skewed.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.117
Shit.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.203
Fuck me.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.872
We've had it right here
all along.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.083
No, we didn't.
You haven't seen this.

27:47.124 --> 27:48.751
-Bosch...
-You want to make detective?

27:48.793 --> 27:50.461
You want to have a long career?

27:50.503 --> 27:52.338
No one can know we found this.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.798
I can take care of myself.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.467
Then do it. You got an adapter?

27:56.509 --> 27:59.553
Yeah.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.764
Set me up on your laptop,
then go take a break.

28:01.806 --> 28:05.476
You know I'm right.

28:05.518 --> 28:08.479
Just let me watch it.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.482
Watch what?

28:11.524 --> 28:13.859
-Harry thinks Walker killed his
mother. -And he can't prove it.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.028
He just keeps running around
in circles,

28:16.070 --> 28:17.863
stalking the man.

28:17.905 --> 28:19.990
I mean, one dead end
after another.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.827
We can't let him go
off the rails on this.

28:22.868 --> 28:23.828
You tell him that?

28:23.869 --> 28:25.663
You talk to him about Gunn?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.456
-I did.
-How'd that go?

28:27.498 --> 28:30.668
Walker did Elias, L.T.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.211
-There's no doubt in my mind.
-All right.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.380
Solve that crime then, J. Edgar.

28:34.422 --> 28:36.382
-We will. -Without letting
Bosch confuse it

28:36.424 --> 28:38.259
or compromise it
because of something

28:38.300 --> 28:40.469
that may or may not
have happened in the past.

29:42.781 --> 29:46.118
Sometimes the big boys
can't see around their egos.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.828
You make it sound so simple.

29:47.870 --> 29:50.748
Simple isn't wrong.
Attention to detail.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.751
Look big, think small.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.046
Bike, gun, stolen phone.

29:57.087 --> 29:58.756
A tone poem.

30:06.931 --> 30:08.974
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.351
What'd I miss?

30:10.392 --> 30:11.727
Nothing.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.729
Got to go deal with Maddie.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.356
-She all right?
-Yeah.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.066
Might take some time.

30:17.107 --> 30:20.903
Go. Me and Snyder will go back
through the call logs,

30:20.945 --> 30:23.113
try to find a Walker
and Lincoln thread.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.658
-Later.
-Yup.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.464
Where's Bosch going?

30:40.506 --> 30:42.132
Family issue.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.176
Oh.

30:46.136 --> 30:47.555
Well, this was a bust.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.482
Chief.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.901
Bosch, I'm on my way
to Hollywood.

31:00.943 --> 31:03.654
Mayor wants to show support
for the peaceful protestors.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.407
I heard. Good luck with that.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.451
I was hoping to discuss
where we stand with Walker.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.870
He's still guilty
is where we stand.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.622
Any progress
with the murder weapon?

31:13.664 --> 31:14.999
Working it.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.792
And the video?

31:16.834 --> 31:18.627
What about it?

31:18.669 --> 31:24.049
If... when you locate it,
I want to be informed

31:24.091 --> 31:26.051
so we can decide
how best to proceed.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.762
Like with Bondigas?

31:28.804 --> 31:31.890
Make it go away
for the greater good?

31:31.932 --> 31:35.019
Detective, one could argue

31:35.060 --> 31:37.855
you have the confirmation
you wanted on River Watch.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.608
At the cost
of the witness I need.

31:40.649 --> 31:44.194
A man found once
can be found again.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.156
Focus on proving
Walker for Elias.

31:47.197 --> 31:50.492
I am. But the video?

31:50.534 --> 31:53.245
Belongs to the man
who paid for it.

31:58.334 --> 31:59.877
Now, my client says

31:59.918 --> 32:03.088
the last time he saw you,
you assaulted him.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.049
May have stumbled
when I opened the door.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.718
What do you want?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.887
We're missing somebody.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.264
You had the cop who tortured me

32:12.306 --> 32:14.642
and you let him fucking go.

32:14.683 --> 32:17.394
He didn't kill Howard Elias.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.854
What he did to you
is why I'm here.

32:18.896 --> 32:21.273
Yeah, right.
Blue brotherhood, right?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.236
Detective.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.405
Ms. Chandler.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.408
Okay we come inside to talk?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.994
I don't want a cop in my house.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.579
Fair enough.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.586
You know what this is.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.130
And you found this among your
boss's personal possessions

32:45.172 --> 32:47.633
when I returned them.

32:47.675 --> 32:51.345
It's Howard's magic bullet.

32:51.387 --> 32:53.013
Keep me out of it.

32:53.055 --> 32:54.598
But however it goes down,
I'll need you to confirm

32:54.640 --> 32:56.100
the chip exists
for my murder case.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.977
-I can do that. -Have you looked
at what's on it?

32:59.019 --> 33:01.313
Protected work product.
I wouldn't dare.

33:01.355 --> 33:02.481
Hey, looked at what?

33:04.566 --> 33:07.194
Mr. Harris, what those cops
did to you was wrong.

33:07.236 --> 33:09.613
And you think this
sets shit right?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.907
No, I do not.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.534
People keep telling me,

33:13.575 --> 33:16.829
"Mike, you gonna cash in.
You hit the lottery."

33:16.870 --> 33:18.122
It's bullshit.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.708
Money can't buy me
my balance back

33:20.749 --> 33:24.503
or stop this noise in my head,
to not wake up screaming.

33:24.545 --> 33:27.840
No, it can't.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.550
But you've got the proof
you need.

33:29.591 --> 33:33.679
Settle with the city, go to
trial, whatever you want...

33:33.721 --> 33:36.682
'cause it's never
gonna be enough.

33:36.724 --> 33:39.101
Might come close.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.522
Bosch.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.943
Thought I had you
all figured out.

33:47.985 --> 33:51.572
Work around your
Special Master conflict.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.658
Mr. Kaplan could use
a second chair.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.347
No justice, no peace.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.101
No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.228
A thousand people?
In their dreams.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.938
Where is everybody?

34:24.980 --> 34:26.356
Sheehan getting released?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.192
Maybe that, uh, took the steam

34:28.233 --> 34:29.860
out of yelling
at where he isn't.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.237
Nah, it's on account
that you sacked up

34:32.279 --> 34:35.491
and showed these pussies
that we're serious, Lieutenant.

34:35.532 --> 34:37.367
-Mm-hmm.
-Like I told you.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.912
The fire bomb didn't figure
into my thinking at all.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.080
I'll consider that a thank you.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.082
No justice, no peace.

34:48.128 --> 34:50.047
- -Oh, shit.

34:50.088 --> 34:53.091
They must be getting hungry.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.640
Chief Irving.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.058
Chief, this is Grace Billets

35:01.099 --> 35:02.726
at Hollywood.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.686
I thought you'd want to know
that the protest turnout

35:04.728 --> 35:05.854
is a little soft.

35:05.896 --> 35:07.689
Well, how soft?

35:07.731 --> 35:10.317
Maybe a hundred people,
including the news crews

35:10.359 --> 35:13.320
and the cops.

35:13.362 --> 35:16.490
Only takes one individual
with bad intent.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.659
Copy that.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.828
I mean, tell the mayor.
Maybe you can turn him around.

35:20.869 --> 35:25.666
It's not gonna be
very much of a photo op.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.752
I'll reach out,
but don't stand down.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.842
All this circumstantial evidence
is not gonna get it done.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.635
Okay, sure.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.178
But in the meantime,
we need to get this guy

35:38.220 --> 35:39.179
out of his comfort zone.

35:39.221 --> 35:40.973
The pretext call.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.308
I think we still got
Lincoln's phone.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.935
I'll get the warrant started.

35:44.977 --> 35:48.397
But if Walker doesn't
take the bait,

35:48.438 --> 35:49.940
couldn't he use that
against us at trial?

35:49.982 --> 35:51.358
A man under pressure is a man

35:51.400 --> 35:52.401
who makes mistakes.

35:52.442 --> 35:55.153
Shit. Took the phone.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.905
-What?
-Harry took the damn phone.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.368
Most people don't realize

36:01.410 --> 36:04.037
Los Angeles has been here
for a thousand years.

36:04.079 --> 36:09.418
Native tribes used to call it
Yang-na, "poison oak place."

36:09.459 --> 36:12.045
Find that more accurate
than City of Angels sometimes.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.756
- -Maybe it's both.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.183
I'm gonna take a walk.

36:25.225 --> 36:27.936
Clear my head.

36:27.978 --> 36:30.063
My father was
a corrupt son of a bitch,

36:30.105 --> 36:33.525
but he taught me what it means
to be steward of a legacy,

36:33.567 --> 36:35.611
to hold history in your hands.

36:35.652 --> 36:38.989
"Rise above," he would tell me.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.575
"Rise above the fray."

36:43.201 --> 36:45.203
Pick me up at Pershing.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.164
I won't be long.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.920
Hey, Jerry.

37:34.962 --> 37:38.006
Maddie. Do you know
where your dad is?

37:38.048 --> 37:39.591
You can't call him?

37:39.633 --> 37:41.134
He's working something.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.678
I'd just rather know
where he is.

37:42.719 --> 37:45.806
Are you asking me
to track down my dad?

37:45.847 --> 37:47.265
Sure. Can you?

37:50.102 --> 37:51.687
He made me download an app
on our phones.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.897
Serves him right.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.405
He's downtown.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.657
Looks like Olive and 5th.

38:03.699 --> 38:06.118
Perfect. Thanks.

38:36.273 --> 38:38.275
No justice, no peace.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.862
No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.197
No justice, no peace.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.199
No justice,
no peace.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.826
No justice, no peace.

38:47.868 --> 38:52.039
No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.332
No justice, no peace.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.251
No justice,
no peace.

38:56.293 --> 38:59.963
No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.299
No justice, no peace.

39:02.340 --> 39:06.636
No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

39:06.678 --> 39:07.929
No justice, no peace.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.765
No justice,
no peace.

39:09.806 --> 39:11.600
No justice, no peace.

39:11.641 --> 39:12.809
No justice,
no peace.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.311
Getting out, sir?

39:14.352 --> 39:17.439
Not just yet.

39:17.481 --> 39:19.649
No justice, no peace.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.693
No justice,
no peace.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.071
-No justice, no peace.
-What the fuck, Jen?

39:24.112 --> 39:26.198
What the fuck is this?

39:26.239 --> 39:27.240
Well, they've seen you.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.450
You've got to get out.

39:28.492 --> 39:30.202
-Jen.
-Just...

39:30.243 --> 39:32.954
just say some words
of support. Keep it simple.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.081
There's nobody here.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.415
No justice, no peace.

39:35.457 --> 39:36.625
No justice,
no peace.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.671
Uh-oh.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.132
No justice, no peace.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.717
No justice,
no peace.

39:45.759 --> 39:47.636
No justice, no peace.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.888
We'll get the cameras in close.

39:49.930 --> 39:52.224
We'll squeeze people to one side
of that barricade behind you.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.267
The crowd will seem
much bigger than this.

39:54.309 --> 39:57.479
I don't even see whatshername,
the Justice Now poster girl.

39:57.521 --> 40:00.357
No. I'm not wearing that. I'll
look like Dukakis in the helmet.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.400
-Jen!
-

40:02.442 --> 40:04.236
The Times's Laura Cooke

40:04.277 --> 40:05.946
just broke a story about
Councilman Clark...

40:05.987 --> 40:07.781
-Mayor! -...funneling
campaign contributions to you

40:07.823 --> 40:09.032
from the Walker Foundation.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.368
That was all aboveboard.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.912
A week before the election, two
days before Bradley Walker got

40:13.954 --> 40:15.080
his building variance
from the city.

40:15.122 --> 40:16.998
That was all...

40:17.040 --> 40:19.126
Mr. Mayor!
Any comment on the allegations?

40:19.167 --> 40:20.293
Mr. Mayor!

40:20.335 --> 40:22.129
No justice, no peace.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.756
No justice,
no peace.

40:24.798 --> 40:28.009
Pull up alongside
the mayor, Sergeant.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.978
Hector.

40:41.857 --> 40:44.568
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

40:44.609 --> 40:47.028
Any reactions to the story
in the L.A. Times?

44:20.533 --> 44:22.577
Police.

44:22.619 --> 44:24.537
Drop your weapon.

44:26.873 --> 44:29.209
Detective Harry Bosch.

44:31.044 --> 44:32.253
No backup?

44:32.295 --> 44:33.546
Drop the weapon.

44:37.175 --> 44:39.594
Shoot me, Harry.
That's what you want to do.

44:52.065 --> 44:54.901
You're the cop
who makes his own rules.

44:54.943 --> 44:57.612
Finds his own justice.

44:57.654 --> 44:59.656
FID will clear you.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.199
Surely.

45:02.992 --> 45:06.079
I have a loaded weapon.

45:06.121 --> 45:07.789
Here's your chance.

45:07.831 --> 45:09.958
And make it easy for you?

45:09.999 --> 45:14.129
You're good for the murders of
Howard Elias and Lanny Johnson.

45:14.170 --> 45:16.214
Then there's Caffrey,

45:16.256 --> 45:19.217
the other victims
of the River Watch arson.

45:19.259 --> 45:21.761
And Marjorie Lowe.

45:21.803 --> 45:24.889
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

45:24.931 --> 45:28.059
City Hotel, 1978.

45:28.101 --> 45:29.477
She was a call girl.

45:29.519 --> 45:30.728
You strangled her.

45:30.770 --> 45:33.314
Left her in a Dumpster.

45:33.356 --> 45:35.358
You're greedy, Bosch.

45:37.402 --> 45:39.279
-Just do it.
-A man's got to be accountable

45:39.320 --> 45:41.698
for what he's done.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.658
Death cheats the system.

45:45.201 --> 45:46.578
And I'm gonna make sure
you spend the rest

45:46.619 --> 45:49.289
of your fucking life
in Pelican Bay solitary.

45:49.330 --> 45:51.916
You won't do well in prison.

45:51.958 --> 45:53.835
Elias broke our contract.

45:53.877 --> 45:56.337
We had a business arrangement.

45:56.379 --> 45:59.007
Out of nowhere, he decides
to destroy my ability

45:59.048 --> 46:00.550
to get funding for development.

46:00.592 --> 46:03.303
Everything my foundation
has done, my family name.

46:03.344 --> 46:06.139
Drop the weapon, Walker.

46:06.181 --> 46:09.184
Forget the rest of them.

46:09.225 --> 46:11.769
There's only one murder
that matters to you, right?

46:13.521 --> 46:17.609
And the only satisfaction you'll
get for that is killing me.

46:19.944 --> 46:23.323
Anything else,

46:23.364 --> 46:26.034
I feel I'd be cheating you.

47:01.069 --> 47:04.656
Drop the fucking gun.

47:04.697 --> 47:06.991
Drop it.

47:07.033 --> 47:10.370
Get on your knees.

47:13.122 --> 47:15.291
Put your hands on your head.

47:22.632 --> 47:23.841
Here we are.

47:23.883 --> 47:25.301
No.

47:25.343 --> 47:27.136
Here you are.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.224
Just say it.

47:31.266 --> 47:32.850
That you killed her.

47:34.519 --> 47:37.522
You know, some people
are the guardians of progress.

47:37.564 --> 47:41.192
We build the cities, we...

47:41.234 --> 47:43.152
we walk you to the future.

47:45.238 --> 47:46.864
Sometimes, other people...

47:48.074 --> 47:50.118
...get in the way.

47:51.619 --> 47:53.621
Marjorie Lowe was a whore.

47:53.663 --> 47:55.748
She knew the game.

47:55.790 --> 48:00.378
I paid her for certain services,
things went awry.

48:02.255 --> 48:04.382
She was my mother.

48:04.424 --> 48:07.885
She was a whore who let them
take her son away.

48:09.679 --> 48:11.514
You murdered my mother, you pig.

48:12.765 --> 48:15.977
I did.

48:16.019 --> 48:17.395
Sorry.

48:28.990 --> 48:30.992
J. Edgar, you heard that?

48:32.243 --> 48:35.705
I heard it, Harry.

48:35.747 --> 48:36.956
It's not admissible.

48:39.709 --> 48:40.918
Securing the weapon.

48:42.629 --> 48:46.591
He had a gun to my head,
you saw it.

48:46.633 --> 48:48.593
Cuff him, call it in.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.439
I didn't fire, Jerry.

49:01.481 --> 49:03.316
I know.

49:03.358 --> 49:05.109
Murder weapon in his hand.

49:05.151 --> 49:07.362
We have him dead to rights
for Elias.

49:08.863 --> 49:10.281
I want a lawyer.

49:11.574 --> 49:13.576
You heard everything?

49:16.162 --> 49:19.540
All I need.

49:19.582 --> 49:21.584
It's done.
