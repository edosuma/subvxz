00:09.960 --> 00:14.040
You must accept spending Christmas
with Elvira and your kids.

00:14.120 --> 00:17.160
I'll accept but don't ask me
to welcome her with open arms.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.280
Why are you so tough on Elvira?

00:19.360 --> 00:21.320
You were not Mr. Perfect either.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.200
I think you forgot about that.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.720
The baby is small, but everything's good.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.400
I wasn't able to tell my family

00:28.480 --> 00:32.040
that Karina had left me and I wouldn't be
coming to Christmas dinner.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.560
It gets stuck right here.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.680
You heard about our association,
Awakening to Life?

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
It helps me.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.080
It's a therapeutic process.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.800
You are an amazing woman, Kathline.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.600
We are very impressed with your work.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.440
I'm so happy!

00:47.120 --> 00:49.240
I have a gift for the whole family.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.800
What about me? I'm not a family member?

00:51.880 --> 00:52.720
Tell them!

00:53.360 --> 00:55.800
He's my son! Lorenzo is my son!

01:39.760 --> 01:41.360
Hi, bro. All good with you?

01:41.440 --> 01:43.600
Sorry, do you have extra napkins?
I forgot.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.360
-Sure. Come in.
-Thanks. Channa would kill me.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.840
-So how was Chile?
-Mexico?

01:49.920 --> 01:51.360
You know what? Great.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.040
Was it your honeymoon?

01:53.120 --> 01:53.960
Yeah.

01:54.040 --> 01:54.880
I didn't know.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.080
-Honey?
-Yes.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.280
Do we have extra napkins for Hakim?

01:59.360 --> 02:00.920
Hi, Hakim. How are you?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.920
-Good. And you, Sandrine?
-Great.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.840
Yes, look in that cupboard.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.160
-You're saving me.
-No problem.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.840
-And congratulations.
-Thank you.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.160
-Here. You want a beer?
-Thanks.

02:12.240 --> 02:15.560
No thanks. Channa's waiting for me.
The restaurant is struggling.

02:15.639 --> 02:16.480
Why?

02:16.560 --> 02:19.600
She's a little stressed out.
It's our first Neighbor's Day.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.760
We don't really know how, you know?

02:22.360 --> 02:24.480
Don't worry. It's very casual.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.000
-Yeah.
-What do you sell?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.240
Chorizo quiches.

02:29.080 --> 02:33.040
They're nice. But Channa wants
to sell them for 4 euros each,

02:33.120 --> 02:36.160
and I'm not sure everyone likes chorizo.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.920
-Thanks for the napkins. My savior!
-You're welcome.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.880
I'll stop by, the skewers look great.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.600
-Sounds good. See you later!
-Thanks.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.600
-You like chorizo quiche?
-Well, no…

02:48.080 --> 02:49.280
Okay, that's done.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.480
Hurry up, we're late.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.360
-I've just started the barbecue.
-Come on…

02:56.120 --> 02:56.960
Okay.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.360
Ta-da!

03:06.160 --> 03:07.400
There are two floors.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.520
Three bedrooms. Here, it's…

03:11.240 --> 03:14.160
the living room,
dining room, open kitchen.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.320
It's next to the high school.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.800
You can have your sock hop here.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.960
I prefer at Dad's.
And it's a party, not a sock hop.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.880
-Your party.
-It's nice.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.400
No, it's awful.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.680
Well…

03:39.320 --> 03:40.520
Which one's my room?

03:41.520 --> 03:42.720
You choose.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.360
It feels fake.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.520
Why?

03:50.400 --> 03:52.840
I don't see how we can be a family here.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.400
Of course, we can. You'll see.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.520
Well… are we going to Dad's barbecue?

04:02.760 --> 04:04.720
You have to imagine it decorated.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.520
There are good vibes.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.720
-You think so?
-Yes.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.640
Yeah, yeah.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.760
Virginie?

04:13.560 --> 04:14.680
Oh, Anton…

04:14.760 --> 04:15.600
He scared me.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.840
Sorry, the door was open so I…
Well, I came in.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.839
Virginie, my daughter.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.519
Isa.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.079
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

04:25.959 --> 04:28.800
I stopped by to see
if you needed something.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.200
You mentioned an issue with the sink.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.480
Yes. Anton is a very handy friend
and he helps me out.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.400
Yes, I…

04:37.560 --> 04:38.400
Are we going?

04:42.000 --> 04:47.640
Well, it wasn't the right time, I guess.
I'll come back. Let me know. Bye.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.640
-Bye.
-Bye.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.320
-He helps you out?
-He's too young.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.640
No, I'm fine, thanks.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.200
Sausage?

05:04.280 --> 05:05.240
Sure, why not?

05:16.920 --> 05:18.520
Hi, Sam. How are you?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.360
Hi, Channa. Sorry…

05:20.440 --> 05:22.520
-Is our location okay?
-Sure.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.200
What is it?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.120
-Tofu sausages.
-Is that good?

05:28.200 --> 05:30.200
Well, they're good for the arteries.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.800
Some people care.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.520
How much are they?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.680
2.90 euros, four for 10 euros.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.200
-I'll go get the rest.
-Yeah.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.440
Don't mind him,
the opening is stressing him out.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.920
Any news from your school?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.280
-This week.
-Yes?

05:48.360 --> 05:51.320
There's still 80 of us for ten spots.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.960
It's in high demand,
and we can only apply once.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.080
Your mom talks a lot about you,
she says you worked like a madman.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.480
-Really?
-Yes.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.880
I hope I won't disappoint her.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.200
Parents are always disappointed
by their children.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.000
And the other way around as well.
Don't worry, sweetie.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.000
You saw your brother over there?

06:13.080 --> 06:14.400
Yes, I saw.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.040
Who's that girl you were talking to?

06:18.720 --> 06:22.200
-The girl I was talking to?
-The bitch with the whore dress.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.560
Honey, she's a neighbor.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.680
On Neighbor's Day, there are neighbors.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.240
She looked very passionate.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.800
I was telling her about our honeymoon.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.920
Look, we're married now.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.680
You wanted to be reassured.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.760
Show me you are.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.480
I want you.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.240
Hello, sir. For a vegan burger.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.160
Hello.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.400
Great, I love tofu.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.640
That's awesome.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.440
Hello.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.200
Would you like to test
your desire for happiness?

07:11.280 --> 07:12.240
No, thanks.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.160
We organize awakenings every Wednesdays.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.720
-Okay.
-Good. Thank you.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.480
-Goodbye.
-Thanks.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.440
We're going to Neighbor's Day.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.280
Now?

07:25.800 --> 07:28.800
Yes, if we go once it's over,
it won't make sense.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.720
I'm not ready.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.200
We agreed, no?

07:35.920 --> 07:38.280
I don't want people thinking
I locked you up.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.000
I'm not ready to see them.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.520
I don't want to force you.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.800
Thank you.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.960
You can go home with Paul.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.760
3.50 euros, okay…

08:02.920 --> 08:04.880
Same thing with your skewers.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.440
4.50 euros is way too much.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.640
And it's duck. Who eats duck today?

08:10.280 --> 08:11.560
Wait here, please.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.880
Goodbye.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.800
Hi.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.640
-Hi.
-How are you?

08:31.240 --> 08:32.200
That's a surprise.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.919
It's Neighbor's Day, no?
Not yours. What, did I have to RSVP?

08:39.400 --> 08:42.360
Wait, don't you have to be
in the field to get a stall?

08:43.440 --> 08:44.679
You gonna rat me out?

08:47.320 --> 08:49.520
Calm down, we're not going to fight.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.640
You're here
to advertise your restaurant a bit?

08:56.320 --> 08:57.320
Yeah, sure.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.440
Tofu Fighters?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.200
Nice slogan.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.880
By the way, I wanted to tell you…

09:08.720 --> 09:11.480
Thanks for hiring Sam. It's good for him.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.240
All right. Bye.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.880
Mom, you don't have to stay.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.320
I can say hi to people I know.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.680
I won't stick around.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.120
No, that's not it. But…

09:28.200 --> 09:29.920
it bothers me when you argue.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.920
We don't argue, we talk sincerely.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.880
-Hello.
-Hi.

09:37.960 --> 09:38.880
How are you?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.320
You saw that?

09:40.400 --> 09:41.320
Teenage years.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.880
No, not that. Patrick.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.440
You want a waffle?

09:45.520 --> 09:48.120
All the things he didn't do
when we were together.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.120
Having a barbecue,

09:50.200 --> 09:52.560
organizing a party for his daughter,

09:52.640 --> 09:54.040
going to Mexico…

09:55.000 --> 09:56.880
That's normal. It's always like that.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.400
-What?
-Hi, Elvira.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.320
How are you?

10:00.240 --> 10:04.280
When we get separated,
we always do things to prove to the other

10:04.360 --> 10:05.760
that they were wrong about us.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.480
By the way…

10:10.680 --> 10:12.800
-I have to tell you something.
-Yes?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.480
Patrick got married.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.640
They did it fast at city hall.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.280
The children weren't even invited.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.520
Excuse me, but now that it's been said,

10:26.600 --> 10:27.960
we can move on.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.280
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.320
-You're good?
-Yes.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.400
You knew your father got married?

10:42.360 --> 10:43.960
Ah, yes…

10:44.760 --> 10:47.720
But they didn't really tell us.
They did it fast.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.400
Well…

11:22.840 --> 11:23.880
Anton?

12:08.960 --> 12:10.000
Dad?

12:10.640 --> 12:11.760
What are you doing here?

12:11.840 --> 12:14.280
The landlord
was supposed to take care of it!

12:14.360 --> 12:16.040
If you tell the landlord,

12:16.120 --> 12:18.760
you'll have the same issue again
next year.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.440
Can you come back tomorrow?

12:21.520 --> 12:25.040
No, tomorrow I'm meeting with Karina.

12:25.120 --> 12:25.960
Really?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.280
She answered you?

12:30.720 --> 12:33.120
No. That's precisely why
I'm going to see her,

12:33.200 --> 12:35.160
because she didn't answer me.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.760
I'm going to tell her that I love her...

12:38.920 --> 12:40.040
that I've changed.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.320
That you changed…

12:43.400 --> 12:44.960
Yes, I've changed.

12:47.160 --> 12:51.720
I don't get angry all the time,
I don't talk as loud.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.800
You're sure? What if she won't see you?

13:00.440 --> 13:06.040
You see, Patrick, every time
he touches my tool box, he...

13:07.440 --> 13:08.440
What is this?

13:09.960 --> 13:11.560
It's a tattoo.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.440
I called it cuckoo.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.640
-What?
-When we were young,

13:18.640 --> 13:21.080
a tattoo was always a name.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.560
And this is a crazy tattoo.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.200
So I call it "Cuckoo".

13:26.280 --> 13:28.920
Cuckoo, you get it?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.000
Love is very important.

13:35.080 --> 13:35.920
-Yes.
-Yes?

13:37.920 --> 13:40.520
-Who's Anton?
-I don't want to talk about it.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.960
You, you have to find a man,

13:45.040 --> 13:46.720
you can't be alone, you understand?

13:46.800 --> 13:50.880
But… I don't feel like it, okay?

13:50.960 --> 13:54.760
We don't have to be in a relationship
to reassure society.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.120
A single woman, what's the problem?

13:57.200 --> 13:59.320
It scares everyone? She's a witch?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.080
I am fine on my own!

14:03.000 --> 14:06.880
Anyway, without the proper tool,
this cannot be fixed.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.600
And you, you will stay alone,

14:09.680 --> 14:12.560
because you are very bad-tempered.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.920
-Fine!
-Okay, fine. Fine!

14:36.120 --> 14:37.320
It's the Las Vegans?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.360
-It's the Last Vegans.
-Great.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.120
-Enjoy.
-Wow, it's great

14:41.200 --> 14:42.720
what you did with the trailer.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.480
-Yes? You think Nonno would like it?
-Yes.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.800
So when will you know about school?

14:47.880 --> 14:50.960
No, don't pressure me, please.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.080
It's tomorrow or the day after,
but we'll see.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.480
-Enjoy!
-Thanks.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.360
Ready to order?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.880
-Yes, I'll have the Tofu To-fire.
-What are you getting?

15:04.760 --> 15:07.200
For me, a Veni Vidi Veggie.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.960
I love the names.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.400
I didn't pick them but I'll let him know.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.960
Who is it?

15:18.840 --> 15:20.080
It's Nonno again.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.960
He wants me to give him back tools
I don't even know about.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.680
-Really?
-Yes.

15:25.560 --> 15:28.400
Should I order something
for Virginie? A dessert?

15:28.480 --> 15:29.520
No.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.560
-No, forget it.
-Yes?

15:33.640 --> 15:35.800
So you'll live
at your dad's or your mom's?

15:35.880 --> 15:37.000
I'll switch.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.520
Like I do. You'll see, it's cool.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.680
You'll get your sister's room back?

15:41.760 --> 15:44.440
I don't know.
I'd like to since she's never here.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.320
That's so cool, living in a garage.
You can go as you please.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.360
How's your mom's place?

15:51.320 --> 15:52.520
I swear, it's great.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.680
-You'll be amazed.
-Like…?

15:55.560 --> 15:58.360
There's a jacuzzi
like at my dad's but indoors.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.120
-Bullcrap.
-You're kidding?

16:01.200 --> 16:06.240
Not at all. You'll see.
I might actually do my party there.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.560
You're doing okay, girls?

16:10.240 --> 16:13.040
-You want a dessert, another drink?
-No, we're good.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.920
Okay. See you later.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.720
Your stepmother's cool.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.600
Mine makes me want to barf.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.680
She's acting cool in front of people
but she hates me.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.880
-She does not.
-Anyway, I don't care.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.440
-I blow my nose in her panties.
-What?

16:35.680 --> 16:36.520
For real.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.960
Great, all your exes are here.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.440
Mommy, Mommy…

16:46.520 --> 16:47.360
Mommy.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.000
-Hi.
-Hello.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.240
Fancy seeing you here.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.040
I love tofu.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.680
This is Olivier, my partner,
soon to be my husband.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.560
Minh Tri's dad.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.520
Sandrine, Patrick's wife.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.080
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.640
-You got married?
-Yes.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.520
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.680
Thank you.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.119
Congratulations to you for…

17:17.599 --> 17:18.920
-Minh Tri.
-…Minh Tri.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.079
Let's go see what's on the menu?

17:22.160 --> 17:25.119
-Yes. See you later.
-Yes.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.319
Thanks, Jeff. It was great.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.760
We want to try it all.

17:30.839 --> 17:32.880
-Thanks for coming.
-You're welcome.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.840
-Hello.
-Hello.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.840
Hi, folks.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.640
-What would you like?
-Hello.

17:41.720 --> 17:42.960
-Bye, love.
-Bye.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.120
Are we going?

17:45.720 --> 17:47.160
Can we give them a ride?

17:47.240 --> 17:48.200
Yes, of course.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.120
Thank you.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.680
You think you could help me
get Carole's room back?

17:52.760 --> 17:54.440
Sandrine wants it for her gym.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.960
It's Carole's bedroom.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.040
She's never here. Please.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.760
How come she's never there?

18:01.520 --> 18:03.440
She sleeps at Awakening to Life.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.240
You know?

18:06.480 --> 18:07.320
Every night?

18:14.040 --> 18:14.880
Patrick.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.880
Carole doesn't sleep at home anymore?

18:19.520 --> 18:20.800
I'll get some coffee.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.440
Well, no. But I think it's temporary.

18:26.080 --> 18:26.920
You think?

18:29.200 --> 18:33.160
Look, she doesn't answer her phone.
She won't touch it. It's impure.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.040
It's hard to follow, you know?

18:35.120 --> 18:37.920
Okay, so you just let her live
at their place, is that it?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.320
"Is that it?" What do you want me to do?

18:40.400 --> 18:41.600
She's an adult, you know.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.040
So because she's 19, we give up on her!

18:44.120 --> 18:46.040
I'm fucking dreaming! So it's my fault?

18:46.120 --> 18:47.800
Everything that happened is my fault!

18:47.880 --> 18:49.200
-I didn't say--
-Stop it!

18:49.280 --> 18:50.160
Please. Stop.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.120
We're just talking.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.440
You're yelling.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.000
You're embarrassing me and you.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.680
Nobody's yelling!
We're talking, that's all.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.000
Why are you yelling? What happened?

18:59.080 --> 19:02.000
Nothing's happening,
we're just worried about you.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.320
We worry, like all parents do!

19:05.040 --> 19:06.720
-Oh, my gosh.
-What was that?

19:07.640 --> 19:08.600
What is it?

19:39.040 --> 19:40.000
She's here.

19:40.080 --> 19:40.960
Is there a problem?

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
The explosion.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.160
It's the aluminum factory.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.640
They're waiting for you in her office.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.200
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.120
Here, thanks.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.000
-You're welcome.
-It doesn't work great.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.520
Faulty wiring, maybe.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.040
Really? It's new.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.440
Do you happen to have a beer?

21:47.520 --> 21:48.440
Yes, sure.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.440
Cool, I can't drink
in front of Channa because she's pregnant.

21:51.520 --> 21:52.840
-Come on in.
-Thanks, cool.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.600
-You heard about the aluminum factory?
-No.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.520
They had a problem with some machine.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
You didn't hear?

22:03.840 --> 22:06.360
The explosion. That was it, last night.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.000
-That's what that was?
-Yeah.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.480
That sucks. You know the worst part?

22:12.560 --> 22:15.640
There would have been
toxic gas released in the air.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.760
-Yeah?
-Yes.

22:17.840 --> 22:22.120
They keep it quiet to avoid a panic,
but avoid drinking from your faucet.

22:22.720 --> 22:23.720
Yes… Okay.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.040
Be careful.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.960
-Go ahead, please.
-It's my father-in-law.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.200
Ex-father-in-law. He's bugging me
about some tools he says I borrowed.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.240
That's a pain.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Yes, Nonno.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.240
Yes. Yes, I know him.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.040
What are you doing here?
I don't have time to talk.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.200
I have something to tell you…

23:12.280 --> 23:14.880
Do you... you want to go for a walk?

23:15.760 --> 23:16.680
Is it the kids?

23:16.760 --> 23:19.080
No. No, the kids are fine.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.160
Let's go outside.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.520
This isn't the right time.
I have a big problem.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.880
I really have to tell you something.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.680
Okay, Patrick, I know it all.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.520
Yes. I know you married Sandrine

23:33.600 --> 23:36.520
and that the pharmacist's son
is not her husband's but yours.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.960
The young Minh Tri?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.720
-Yes.
-You think he's my son?

23:40.800 --> 23:42.520
I know what Lambert kids look like.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.600
-I'm going back.
-Wait…

23:49.000 --> 23:50.960
It's… It's Nonno…

23:53.080 --> 23:54.760
He had a car accident.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.840
He's dead.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.440
Is that a joke?

25:13.680 --> 25:14.520
I'll go.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.640
-Yes?
-Good morning. Is Carole here?

25:26.640 --> 25:27.480
Wait.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.280
I'd like to talk to Carole.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.320
I'm sorry, she's resting.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.560
Her grandfather had a car accident.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.040
He's dead.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.520
I'll go check.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.800
Dad, can I ask you a question?

26:00.280 --> 26:03.400
Yes, but honey,
we don't know exactly what happened.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.640
Well, actually it's about my party.

26:09.640 --> 26:10.960
Do we have to cancel?

26:14.160 --> 26:16.720
It's just that it's next week so…

26:24.880 --> 26:27.080
Sorry but Carole doesn't want
to talk to you.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.440
What? Wait, I have to tell her!

26:29.520 --> 26:31.720
I told her. She is sad to hear that.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.800
But she doesn't want to see you,
I'm sorry.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.960
I'm sorry too. I want to see my daughter.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.040
Let me through.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.280
Carole! Excuse me. Carole!

26:56.640 --> 26:57.720
Carole…

27:03.520 --> 27:04.440
Come with me.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.360
No.

27:08.520 --> 27:09.840
I'd rather mourn here.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.520
You know,
sometimes a family needs to be together.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.840
That's my family here, too.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.560
They take care of me.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.200
You really think they care about you?

27:27.960 --> 27:31.840
You think it will go better
just by doing the cow or the dog?

27:31.920 --> 27:33.600
You don't see it's bullcrap?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.840
You preferred when I was with my cousin?

27:41.320 --> 27:43.280
Is that what a family reunion is?

27:46.480 --> 27:47.400
Leave me alone.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.200
You'll choose your favorite pictures
and after we'll…

28:07.880 --> 28:09.880
We'll make a little altar.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.040
To think about Nonno until the ceremony.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.960
We should tell the people who knew him.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.160
Yes, you're right.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.640
I can do it, if you'd like.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.000
I'd like that, yes.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.720
-I don't have the strength.
-Okay.

28:48.880 --> 28:55.880
PHARMACY

29:15.760 --> 29:16.600
Brigitte…

29:18.080 --> 29:18.920
Hi.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.520
Hi.

29:21.120 --> 29:25.200
Listen, I won't beat around the bush.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.000
When I saw you with the young Minh Tri,

29:28.840 --> 29:30.760
I had a weird feeling.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.000
What weird feeling?

29:33.080 --> 29:35.560
I thought, "That's my son."

29:36.240 --> 29:37.080
What?

29:37.640 --> 29:41.080
Look, Brigitte, I have three kids,
I know what a young Lambert looks like.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.040
He's my son.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.680
Not at all, you're crazy.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.360
I don't think so, given your reaction.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.280
It's not great to let him believe
a stranger is his dad.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.120
Not a stranger. He knows him, not you.

29:54.200 --> 29:58.200
You see! You didn't say,
"He's not a stranger, he's his dad."

29:58.280 --> 29:59.880
But, "He knows him, not you."

29:59.960 --> 30:01.400
Patrick, fuck off.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.480
Hi, Brigitte.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.360
Good morning, Françoise.

30:04.440 --> 30:07.680
You're insane, you mothers!

30:07.760 --> 30:11.120
You're insane!
You think you're God and can do anything.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.920
I know, it's wrong
to talk badly about mothers.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.520
But I can do it because I've decided
to live the truth.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.440
Because life is very fragile.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.920
You're here, and bam, you're not!

30:23.000 --> 30:23.840
There!

30:28.000 --> 30:29.680
WHAT IF LOVE COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING?

30:29.760 --> 30:32.120
We hear a lot of lies
about what a couple really is.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.400
It's not a psychological
or materialistic construct.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.880
It's… It's a sum of energies.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.440
It's the addition
of common desire and willingness.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.280
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.440
It messes with my mind.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.000
I can't believe it.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.840
I feel like Nonno
will show up in five minutes.

31:04.840 --> 31:08.000
That's why mourning rituals are important.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.400
To mark a before and after.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.600
You'll come to the funeral?

31:16.320 --> 31:18.040
I'd like you by my side.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.840
If it's a funeral, yes,
but not for a cremation.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.400
Right, we're against it.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.760
It was supposed to be a surprise but…

31:31.640 --> 31:34.080
I asked Paul and Eloise to organize

31:34.160 --> 31:35.960
a ceremony to honor your grandfather.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.200
Everyone wants to join in.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.880
It's our role to help you honor

31:41.960 --> 31:44.040
your grandfather's memory correctly

31:44.680 --> 31:46.400
and in accordance with our beliefs.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.480
We know how important he was to you.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.840
TO OUR DAD, GRANDPA
AND FATHER-IN-LAW

31:55.920 --> 31:57.200
WE LOVE YOU

31:57.280 --> 32:01.440
IN OUR HEARTS FOR ETERNITY

32:10.080 --> 32:11.040
Can I help you?

32:12.320 --> 32:14.000
No, I'm just looking.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.280
FUNERALS - CONTRACTS
FUNERAL HOME

32:30.360 --> 32:31.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.920
Thanks for coming.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.760
Well, it's normal.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.320
We're going in?

32:40.400 --> 32:41.240
You go first.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.760
Good morning.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.880
-Good morning.
-It's for…?

32:51.960 --> 32:54.240
It's for a passing.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.360
ENJOY YOUR LAST TRIP IN STYLE

32:56.440 --> 32:58.480
Basically, the average price for a funeral

32:58.560 --> 33:01.040
in France is 3,350 euros per person.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.480
But if you choose us
as your funeral operator,

33:04.560 --> 33:07.560
you'll save at least 30 percent
across the board.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.720
Are you thinking
about a burial or a cremation?

33:14.640 --> 33:17.520
Ideally, I'd like to have him buried

33:18.480 --> 33:19.320
in a cemetery.

33:20.560 --> 33:23.880
My mother is buried in Nice,
maybe we could reunite them.

33:24.520 --> 33:29.200
Very well.
Do you have space in a family vault?

33:29.280 --> 33:31.160
Do you have a concession?

33:32.280 --> 33:34.760
-No.
-In that case…

33:34.840 --> 33:37.360
It's a little bit like a car, you see?

33:37.440 --> 33:39.800
Better to buy a garage
than think at the last minute,

33:39.880 --> 33:42.000
"I might find a parking spot."

33:42.080 --> 33:43.120
-Yeah.
-Yes.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.640
So how do I do it?

33:47.960 --> 33:49.440
You really want to bury him?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.760
Yes. I do.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.360
So, per the current legislation,

33:56.120 --> 33:58.160
the minimal required supplies are

33:58.240 --> 34:01.440
the four-handled coffin,

34:01.520 --> 34:03.720
but without the other accessories

34:03.800 --> 34:05.960
which will be an extra cost.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.360
That seems perfect.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.360
All right.

34:09.120 --> 34:13.159
I also need the deceased's municipality
in order to be able

34:13.840 --> 34:15.760
to inform city hall.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.400
-Where he died?
-No.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.159
Where he lives or lived.

34:20.719 --> 34:22.400
His main residence.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.520
Well, I…

34:24.360 --> 34:27.320
I'll give you my address
because my dad lived in his trailer.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.280
You mean he was homeless?

34:30.360 --> 34:32.159
-No, not at all.
-No?

34:32.239 --> 34:33.280
He was a traveler.

34:33.360 --> 34:34.840
Yes, of course, so…

34:34.920 --> 34:36.679
Without a primary residence,

34:36.760 --> 34:39.320
you can choose between
the common grave or a cremation.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.960
I recommend cremation.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.440
It's also less expensive.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.239
The price for a cremation depends--

34:49.320 --> 34:50.600
Can we have a moment?

34:51.920 --> 34:54.600
Yes, of course.
No problem. Take your time.

35:05.000 --> 35:05.840
So…

35:07.200 --> 35:08.040
Okay…

35:09.560 --> 35:13.040
What do you think?
You were close to him lately.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.440
Yes, but… you know…

35:17.440 --> 35:21.800
We didn't really talk about urn or coffin.

35:21.880 --> 35:22.720
I don't know.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.600
It's super expensive, a burial.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.120
But an urn, it's…

35:31.840 --> 35:32.920
Go ahead, answer.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.920
Well, an urn then.

35:51.880 --> 35:53.240
You're not at the food truck?

35:54.560 --> 35:57.480
-No.
-Here, it's for you.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.000
Is it the answer from the school?

36:07.960 --> 36:09.080
Can you open it, please?

36:25.280 --> 36:27.080
It's in English, but I think it's good.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.160
It's good.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.040
It's good!

36:45.280 --> 36:47.160
I can't believe we bought this thing.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.880
We're gonna put my dad in this?

36:52.960 --> 36:55.360
It's the worst thing we can imagine, no?

36:58.520 --> 36:59.480
I have an idea.

37:01.120 --> 37:03.760
I know what we'll do
once Nonno is in there.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.400
It won't be simple because

37:06.480 --> 37:08.760
he was not the kind
to get shut off easily.

37:09.720 --> 37:13.600
We'll create the Nonno National Museum.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.120
So that anywhere in France…
What am I saying?

37:18.200 --> 37:19.400
Anywhere in the world,

37:20.040 --> 37:23.920
we never forget who Nonno was.
We'll create a museum

37:24.000 --> 37:26.880
to honor him-- to Nonnor him.

37:26.960 --> 37:31.120
And when people enter the museum,
they'll have to sign a bill of rights

37:31.800 --> 37:35.360
stating that they promise to never, never

37:35.480 --> 37:37.040
reheat pizza in a microwave.

37:37.120 --> 37:40.880
Never. Never put Parmesan on seafood…

37:40.960 --> 37:42.480
-Spaghetti.
- …spaghetti.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.160
Never!
They'll enter and get yelled at instantly.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.400
What are you doing? You can't buy food

37:49.480 --> 37:51.680
at the shitty capitalist supermarket!

37:52.280 --> 37:53.120
You see?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.080
Hello? Yes, honey.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.880
Where are you? Will you be home soon?

38:03.680 --> 38:07.120
Yes, I'm on my way.
I picked up Sam at the food truck.

38:07.720 --> 38:08.560
<i>You're with Sam?</i>

38:09.720 --> 38:12.880
Yes, I'm with him. He's in front of me.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.280
<i>I dropped him at his mom's</i>
<i>and I'll be home.</i>

38:15.360 --> 38:17.520
<i>-See you in a bit?</i>
-Yes, see you.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.960
-Show me.
-I think it's a bit much.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.920
No. Look that's something else.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.440
It's classy too.

38:24.960 --> 38:25.800
Stop it.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.920
She's a little… a lot jealous.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.320
-Good, that's a change for you.
-Yeah.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.280
Change is good.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.040
Change is good.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.160
Thanks for going with me.

39:34.960 --> 39:38.120
<i>If one day you want to come back</i>

39:41.480 --> 39:45.320
<i>Without a word, a tear, or even a smile</i>

39:48.360 --> 39:51.960
<i>Casually, without holding yourself back</i>

39:54.760 --> 39:59.000
<i>Without mentioning the past or the future</i>

40:04.800 --> 40:08.240
<i>At night, when I see you smile</i>

40:11.280 --> 40:15.240
<i>On that picture which makes no sense</i>

40:18.000 --> 40:22.080
<i>Under your old lamp</i>
<i>Which shakes and capsizes</i>

40:24.640 --> 40:28.760
<i>You come wincing in my memories</i>

40:28.840 --> 40:32.040
<i>Now, as you did before</i>

40:34.000 --> 40:41.000
<i>Gently, without fading</i>
<i>Without lying, without suffering</i>

40:43.200 --> 40:47.680
<i>Today, I'm telling you</i>

40:47.760 --> 40:52.320
<i>Suffering at your hands is not suffering</i>

40:54.640 --> 40:58.560
<i>It's like dying or making a joke</i>

41:01.360 --> 41:05.960
<i>It's departing from the living</i>

41:08.280 --> 41:12.480
<i>In the forest, only seeing the dead tree</i>

41:12.560 --> 41:17.280
NONNO'S PIZZA
