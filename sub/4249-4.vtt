12:05.558 --> 12:07.518
MUST BE THE EXCITEMENT.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.645
LONDON, HERE I COME.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.356
- FINALLY!

12:12.440 --> 12:14.859
[stammers]
FINALLY GOT THIS SHUT.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.986
- AW, THANKS.
THANKS, FABIAN.

12:17.069 --> 12:22.825
NOW, KEEP UP THE POETRY,
AND SAY IT LOUD AND CLEAR.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.785
- [chuckling]
OOH!

12:27.329 --> 12:30.124
- [yawns loudly]

12:30.207 --> 12:31.375
I HATE MORNINGS.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.837
- WELL, I LOVE MORNINGS.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.549
ALL THAT PEACE AND QUIET
FOR UNINTERRUPTED STUDY.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.134
WE'RE SO DIFFERENT.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.845
- BUT SO RIGHT.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.889
ARE THOSE NEW GLASSES?

12:44.972 --> 12:46.223
THEY'RE KIND OF...

12:46.307 --> 12:48.601
- DISFIGURING.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.188
- WELL, I THINK
THEY'RE CUTE ON YOU.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.564
- PRINCESS AMBER,
YOUR CARRIAGE AWAITS.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.525
- NO WAY.
IS IT A CONVERTIBLE?

12:56.609 --> 12:59.153
- I'M GONNA SAY YES.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.529
- [squeals]

13:00.613 --> 13:05.826
- AND...TA-DA!

13:05.910 --> 13:08.245
- THERE'S NO WAY I'M GETTING
ON THAT RUNKY TRACTOR.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.830
- DUDE, THAT IS SICK!

13:09.914 --> 13:12.333
- CAN I HAVE A RIDE, ALFIE?
- NO WAY, ME FIRST.

13:12.416 --> 13:17.004
- AS THE POTENTIAL G.F.,
I GET AUTOMATIC SHOTGUN.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.172
- [laughs]

13:18.255 --> 13:21.091
THAT IS HILARIOUS.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.259
[engine turns over]

13:22.343 --> 13:24.553
[engine rumbling]

13:24.637 --> 13:27.973
[laughter]

13:28.057 --> 13:30.893
[cheers and applause]

13:34.021 --> 13:36.857
[engine rumbling]

13:51.622 --> 13:54.625
[engine rumbles down]

13:54.708 --> 13:56.585
- DID I PASS THE TEST?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.504
- YOU GET AN "A"
FOR AMBITION, ALFIE LEWIS,

13:58.587 --> 14:00.297
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN I SAID "WHEELS"--

14:00.381 --> 14:03.008
- YOU NEVER SPECIFIED
A CAR, AMBER.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.387
YOU DIDN'T.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.098
- OKAY.

14:09.181 --> 14:09.932
YOU PASSED THE TEST.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.855
- SO DOES THIS MEAN
WE'RE OFFICIALLY "AMFIE" NOW?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.566
CAN I TELL THE WORLD?
- NO.

14:18.649 --> 14:23.612
WE HAVE TO GO ON A TRIAL DATE
BEFORE WE'RE OFFICIAL.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.906
MY PEOPLE WILL BE
IN TOUCH.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.621
- [straining]

14:34.039 --> 14:36.959
- THE DOLLHOUSE IS THE KEY.
I KNOW IT IS.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.961
IT'S TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING
WHEN IT LIGHTS UP.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.630
- WHERE TO FIND THE MASK?
- MAYBE.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.924
BUT JASPER SAID THE MASK
DOESN'T EVEN EXIST,

14:44.008 --> 14:47.261
IN WHICH CASE,
I'M SAFE.

14:47.344 --> 14:52.641
[sighs]
SO WHY DON'T I FEEL IT?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.477
- THEY'VE GOT LOADS
IN COMMON NOW.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.647
LAST NIGHT, I HIT HIM
WITH MY HISTORY RESEARCH,

14:58.731 --> 15:00.399
AND HE DIDN'T
GLAZE OVER ONCE.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.776
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.278
- I'M TAKING
YOUR ADVICE, PATRICIA.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.156
BUT I THINK HE LIKES
GEEKY ME.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.409
I NEED
TO STEP IT UP AGAIN.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.662
- I DON'T REMEMBER GIVING ANYONE
ANY ADVICE.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.164
- MORNING, EVERYONE.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.334
OH, JOY, WHILE I REMEMBER,
I'VE GOT THAT CD I MENTIONED

15:18.417 --> 15:19.793
FOR THE BEGINNING
OF YOUR FILM.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.337
COLLECT IT
AT THE END OF CLASS.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.588
- DO YOU WANT TO LISTEN
TO IT TONIGHT, YEAH?

15:22.671 --> 15:25.007
- YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.
- OKAY, IT'S A DATE.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.093
- BUT NOT REALLY A DATE.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.971
[both laugh]

15:34.350 --> 15:35.643
- VERY GENEROUS OF YOU

15:35.726 --> 15:37.269
TO OFFER YOUR SERVICES,
MR. CHOUDHARY.

15:37.353 --> 15:41.690
- OH, AND MOST ENLIGHTENING

15:41.774 --> 15:44.026
A COLLECTION OF SCROLLS.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.445
- 14TH CENTURY B.C.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.365
THEY WERE PUT IN ONE BOOK
OF ISIS IN RECENT CENTURIES.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.783
- FASCINATING.
- YES, QUITE.

15:50.866 --> 15:51.742
- SHALL WE...

15:51.825 --> 15:53.702
- OH, NO NEED.
I KNOW THE WAY.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.580
- OH, WELL, BYE-BYE FOR NOW,
AND THANK YOU.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.292
- THANK YOU.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.628

16:02.711 --> 16:03.879
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:03.962 --> 16:06.548
- I AM GOING TO BE THE CURATOR
OF THIS EXHIBITION

16:06.632 --> 16:07.716
IF THE SCHOOL WINS THE BID.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.009
- GREAT.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.053
OH, AND DID YOU MANAGE TO FIND
ANY MORE INFORMATION

16:11.136 --> 16:12.179
ON THE MASK OF ANUBIS?

16:12.262 --> 16:13.555
- I'M ON TO IT.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.766
I'M MEETING AN EXPERT I KNOW
FROM AN ONLINE FORUM

16:15.849 --> 16:19.853
WHO CALLS HIMSELF
"THE COLLECTOR."

16:19.937 --> 16:22.064
[boys talking and laughing]

16:22.147 --> 16:25.442
- GIVE ME AN "M."

16:25.526 --> 16:28.153
- "M."
- GIVE ME AN "I"!

16:28.237 --> 16:30.322
- "I."
- GIVE ME A "C!"

16:30.406 --> 16:32.366
- "C!"

16:32.449 --> 16:33.909
- GIVE ME A--
- "K."

16:33.992 --> 16:37.121
- I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO CHEER
ME ON AT CHESS CLUB TONIGHT.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.581
5:00 P.M.
NO TRACK PANTS.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.751
- JUST TRY AND STOP ME.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.965
- IS HE EVEN MORE
IN TO ME NOW?

16:48.048 --> 16:49.758
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.469
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.096
- [sighs]

16:54.179 --> 16:56.640
- IF SARAH'S MOTHER MADE
THE REPLICA,

16:56.724 --> 16:59.184
SHE MUST HAVE SEEN THE ORIGINAL
AT SOME POINT, RIGHT?

16:59.268 --> 17:00.310
- I WAS THINKING THE SAME.

17:00.394 --> 17:04.189
SO WHAT IF THE FROBISHER-SMYTHES
BROUGHT BACK

17:04.272 --> 17:07.526
MORE THAN JUST THE CUP
FROM EGYPT?

17:07.608 --> 17:09.111
- HI, GUYS.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.405
WHAT'S THE GOSS?
SIBUNA ME.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.115
- [stammers]

17:13.198 --> 17:15.951
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT NOW
NINA'S GRAN'S GONE,

17:16.034 --> 17:17.953
MAYBE ME AND NINA COULD GO OUT
ON THAT DATE.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.204
- [gasps]
ABOUT TIME TOO.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.082
- HOW ABOUT TONIGHT
FOR THAT DATE, FABIAN?

17:22.165 --> 17:26.420
OH, WAIT.
YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE WITH JOY.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.130
- WH--
- SHUT UP.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.339
- [stammering]
NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING SILLY.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.716
I MEAN, WE'RE ONLY MEETING
TO DISCUSS--

17:30.799 --> 17:34.219
- THE FILM, YEAH.
I KNOW.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.099
- AWKWARD.

17:41.393 --> 17:45.189
- I'M TELLING YOU,
SWEETIE KNEW MY DAD.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.983
HE WENT ALL WEIRD
WHEN I MENTIONED HIS NAME.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.318
- MR. SWEET'S TOO YOUNG

17:49.401 --> 17:51.111
TO HAVE BEEN RUNNING THE SCHOOL
BACK THEN, POPPY.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.072
- OKAY, THE SCHOOL WEBSITE
HAS AN ARCHIVE.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.658
[knocking at door]
- COME IN.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.118
- HI, EVERYONE.
OH, ARE YOU BUSY?

17:58.202 --> 18:01.747
- YEAH, SO WHY DON'T YOU GO
SCORE SOME HOOPS

18:01.830 --> 18:05.000
OR SHOOT SOME GOALS
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.214
- YEAH.
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I DO.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.054
- [laughs]
WOW.

18:17.137 --> 18:20.766
YOU MUST REALLY HATE
HIS GUTS.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.726
- NO, THE OPPOSITE.

18:22.810 --> 18:28.649
I LOVE THOSE GUTS.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.150
- MARA, I NEED YOU
TO EVACUATE.

18:30.234 --> 18:34.988
I NEED THIS ROOM FOR A DATE
THAT'S NOT A DATE.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.908
- [laughs]
WHEN I'M YOUR AGE...

18:37.991 --> 18:42.162
AM I GONNA BE THIS WEIRD?

18:42.246 --> 18:45.374
- HIDDEN IN
THIS BOOK OF OLD,

18:45.457 --> 18:49.044
WATER OF LIFE
AND TEARS OF GOLD.

18:49.127 --> 18:53.090
- BOOKS OF OLD,
BOOKS OF OLD.

18:53.173 --> 18:57.219
BOOKS,<i> LIBRE ANTIGUOS</i>
TOOK BOOKS OF OLD.

18:57.302 --> 19:02.266

"TRANSPOSED INTO BOOK FORM

THE HIEROGLYPHS THEMSELVES

19:15.863 --> 19:19.283
IF OUR GUEST WAS CORRECT,
CORBIERE,

19:19.366 --> 19:24.329
ONE OF THESE MUST BE
<i>THE BOOK OF ISIS.</i>

19:31.545 --> 19:34.339
- 1978...

19:35.799 --> 19:39.595
JOHN CLARKE.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.100
[gasps]

19:45.183 --> 19:46.393
IT'S HIM.

19:46.476 --> 19:50.314
- HOLD ON.
GO BACK TO THAT LAST PAGE.

19:50.397 --> 19:54.276
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT
ABOUT SWEETIE TOO.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.444
LOOK AT THIS.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.446
IT'S DEFINITELY HIM.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.114
THEY WERE BOTH ANUBIS HOUSE.

19:59.197 --> 20:04.244
- SO WHY DIDN'T HE SAY?
[sighs]

20:04.328 --> 20:06.163
[melancholy music playing]

20:06.246 --> 20:08.415
- I VOTE WE GO
FOR TRACK ONE.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.124
THIS ONE'S A BIT SLOW.

20:09.207 --> 20:11.293
- YOU THINK?
- YEAH.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.171
- I KIND OF LIKE IT.
- MM...

20:14.254 --> 20:16.173
- OH, OW.
[groans]

20:16.256 --> 20:17.883
- WHAT IS IT?
- OH, I GOT A CRAMP.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.468
OW.
- OH, LET ME, LET ME, LET ME.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.553
- OW!
- SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.348
- [groans]

20:24.431 --> 20:28.518
- IS THAT OKAY?
- YEAH.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.396
- OOPS, SORRY.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.860
- CRAMP!
CRAMP!

20:36.944 --> 20:39.780
SO TRACK ONE, THEN?
BYE.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.532
- BAD TIMING MUCH?

20:42.616 --> 20:44.534
- PLAYING WITH FIRE MUCH?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.370
- [sighs]

20:49.539 --> 20:53.001
- I CAN'T COME WITH YOU,
JOY.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.004
I'M GOING ON A DATE
WITH NINA.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.557
[laughs]

21:07.641 --> 21:09.476
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

21:13.271 --> 21:16.233
AH!

21:16.316 --> 21:18.443
[gasping]

21:29.997 --> 21:32.124

21:32.207 --> 21:36.378
[demonic female laughter]

21:36.461 --> 21:38.505
[magical hissing]

21:40.716 --> 21:44.594
- [gasps]

21:44.678 --> 21:45.971
WHAT IS IT?

21:46.054 --> 21:49.558
WHERE IS IT?

21:49.641 --> 21:53.311
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW ME.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.856
[gasps]

21:55.939 --> 21:58.942
FINALLY.
