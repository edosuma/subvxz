WEBVTT

00:36.640 --> 00:42.049
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.579 --> 00:44.079
Since the company is...

00:44.079 --> 00:46.350
doing so well now, you should sell it...

00:46.450 --> 00:48.490
and keep the cash.

00:48.689 --> 00:51.820
Are you saying the company has been passed over to your stepmother?

00:51.890 --> 00:53.729
Only their second eldest son knows about this.

00:53.829 --> 00:57.729
Plus, he probably has no idea about the share disposal.

00:57.859 --> 00:59.859
Don't trust Bok Ja Park too much.

01:00.399 --> 01:03.070
As I watched from close proximity, I didn't think this was right.

01:03.329 --> 01:07.469
It's difficult to be accepted as a member of Seven Princesses.

01:07.569 --> 01:10.480
They're all women who possess moral influence and intelligence.

01:10.579 --> 01:12.010
How much are you going to sell it for?

01:12.109 --> 01:13.579
I want 75,000,000 dollars in cash.

01:14.109 --> 01:16.010
Sir, Ms. Park sold...

01:16.750 --> 01:20.719
all of the company shares to a private equity fund.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.219
And since then, no one has been able to...

01:24.359 --> 01:25.519
get a hold of her.

02:33.629 --> 02:34.759
She died from TBI.

02:35.129 --> 02:38.129
There's no evidence of rape or signs of resistance.

02:39.699 --> 02:41.669
The killer hit her here twice with a blunt weapon.

02:42.099 --> 02:43.439
The artery ruptured right away.

02:44.969 --> 02:46.710
We don't even have any space to store the body.

02:46.969 --> 02:48.210
Please get her transferred soon.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.479
Okay.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.659
Who do you think did it?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.729
I thought it was her, but I was wrong.

03:14.169 --> 03:15.900
She's the only one with a firm alibi.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.069
Where can I take you, ma'am?

03:21.370 --> 03:23.110
- Gwangun Hospital, please. - Sure.

03:27.449 --> 03:28.949
(Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation)

03:29.080 --> 03:31.680
NFS' official autopsy report won't be released until three weeks later,

03:31.750 --> 03:33.590
but we know she died of brain hemorrhage...

03:33.590 --> 03:34.789
caused by a blunt weapon.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.590
The time of death is presumed to be at around 2am on February 28th.

03:38.919 --> 03:42.990
The first call to the police was made at 9:17am that day.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.259
Next, I'll go over who's on our list of suspects.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.770
Ahn Tae Dong.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.770
Park Ji Yeong's husband who certainly has...

03:48.770 --> 03:50.439
enough motive to kill her.

03:50.770 --> 03:53.840
I rarely see you these days because you're so busy.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.569
My life is so boring and dull without you around.

03:56.810 --> 03:59.009
The company has to operate like a well-oiled machine...

03:59.139 --> 04:02.580
for you to feel at ease and live a stress-free life.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.819
I can't part ways with you.

04:04.879 --> 04:07.289
- Why do you say that... - I trust you.

04:07.389 --> 04:11.090
Why does that keep sounding like you can't trust me?

04:12.060 --> 04:14.590
Ahn Jae Gu. He's Ahn Tae Dong's eldest child.

04:14.729 --> 04:17.800
He threatened Park Ji Yeong multiple times before she died.

04:17.930 --> 04:19.660
He was even charged with attempted murder.

04:19.930 --> 04:22.230
He's definitely one of our prime suspects.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.000
I've already killed someone before.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.209
First time, it's hard. The second time, not so much.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.569
Hey, you wench. Are you looking down on me?

04:30.040 --> 04:32.410
Do you think you can just kick my wife and child out of the house?

04:32.509 --> 04:33.509
Ahn Jae Hui.

04:33.779 --> 04:36.610
She's Ahn Tae Dong's second child. Even though she was...

04:36.920 --> 04:38.949
in the same space as the victim on the day of the incident,

04:39.050 --> 04:41.290
she lied in her statement by saying that she wasn't with her.

04:41.519 --> 04:44.019
Hey. Fix a meal for me.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.860
- I'm a caregiver. - So, what?

04:46.959 --> 04:49.990
Jae Hui, you're old enough.

04:50.459 --> 04:52.800
- Don't throw a tantrum. - What did you say?

04:52.860 --> 04:56.600
Should I scrub the bathroom floor with soap so she'll slip and die?

04:56.839 --> 04:59.569
Park Ju Mi. She's married to Ahn Tae Dong's eldest son.

04:59.670 --> 05:03.209
She has no alibi for the day of the murder and the statements...

05:03.439 --> 05:05.240
we received from people around the victim make her...

05:05.339 --> 05:06.410
one of our prime suspects.

05:07.779 --> 05:09.050
He's putting on a show, Father.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.250
I bet he's colluding with this woman.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.790
She's the mastermind behind it.

05:13.850 --> 05:16.860
Shut it! How dare you spew such nonsense?

05:17.160 --> 05:18.720
If you can't do that, do something before you go.

05:18.790 --> 05:19.959
At least...

05:21.360 --> 05:22.790
kill that woman before you go.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.730
Cheon Bang Soon.

05:24.860 --> 05:27.899
Park Ji Yeong worked with her at a bar in her hometown.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.040
I'll become your eyes and ears as you want.

05:31.100 --> 05:34.110
I trust you. You know that, right?

05:34.839 --> 05:37.209
Then, what are your plans afterward?

05:37.279 --> 05:38.839
Don't ask me things like that anymore.

05:38.910 --> 05:42.810
Also, call me "Madam" even when it's just the two of us.

05:43.050 --> 05:45.980
In her statement, she said she felt so betrayed...

05:46.149 --> 05:48.089
by Ji Yeong that she would have killed her herself...

05:48.420 --> 05:50.259
even if she hadn't been killed.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.790
We plan to have her take a polygraph test.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.029
Gu Bong Cheol.

05:55.990 --> 05:59.160
He and Ji Yeong grew up together like siblings at the same orphanage.

05:59.399 --> 06:03.069
He has fallen off the grid though. We've put out an APB on him.

06:03.569 --> 06:05.300
We must not let her go any further...

06:06.040 --> 06:07.769
or have her way.

06:08.939 --> 06:10.209
Cripple her.

06:11.709 --> 06:14.449
This is Han Min Gi, the CEO of MK Capital.

06:14.509 --> 06:17.949
We're not sure if this man is Ji Yeong's ally...

06:18.019 --> 06:20.519
or if he has a hostile relationship with her.

06:20.620 --> 06:23.519
Hello. I'm Han Min Gi, the CEO of MK Capital.

06:23.790 --> 06:26.089
There is a group of ladies that gather regularly.

06:26.660 --> 06:28.089
They call themselves Seven Princesses.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.230
Ji Yeong's call history shows...

06:30.629 --> 06:32.230
that she spoke to him before she was killed.

06:32.899 --> 06:33.930
He's...

06:36.670 --> 06:38.639
Detective Lee, Ms. Woo A Jin is here.

06:40.410 --> 06:44.240
Were you with Ms. Park Ji Yeong the day Chairman Ahn collapsed?

06:45.240 --> 06:47.550
No, I wasn't.

06:47.879 --> 06:49.779
I heard that she attended...

06:50.379 --> 06:52.350
your divorce trial.

06:53.889 --> 06:55.649
You called Ms. Park and asked her to meet up, right?

06:55.750 --> 06:56.790
Yes, I did.

06:57.259 --> 06:59.660
She left right after the trial though.

06:59.990 --> 07:02.889
I tried calling her again, but I wasn't able to get a hold of her.

07:02.959 --> 07:05.629
Then, how did you manage to get a hold of her after that?

07:12.800 --> 07:15.139
Let me summarize what you've told me so far.

07:15.970 --> 07:18.410
Ms. Park got all of Chairman Ahn's company shares...

07:18.509 --> 07:20.509
transferred to herself, sold them,

07:20.649 --> 07:22.850
cashed them, and disappeared.

07:23.550 --> 07:26.620
Then, why did she change her mind all of a sudden...

07:26.720 --> 07:29.050
and come back home? That's what I'm wondering.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.860
Matisse and Kandinsky.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.730
That's what made her come back.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.399
As per the plaintiff Woo A Jin's request,

07:42.800 --> 07:44.740
I hereby declare that their marriage is now dissolved.

08:02.350 --> 08:03.959
- Hello? - Ms. Woo.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.290
- Ms. Park. - The chairman has collapsed.

08:07.089 --> 08:08.790
The chairman has collapsed.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.540
I won't go back.

08:21.610 --> 08:22.639
Ms. Park.

08:24.610 --> 08:27.750
Please take good care of him.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.149
Mr. Kim, have you been able to get a hold of Ms. Park yet?

08:35.490 --> 08:36.789
Well, it's...

08:37.960 --> 08:39.490
It doesn't look like she'll come back.

08:39.558 --> 08:41.029
You've known about it, haven't you?

08:41.730 --> 08:43.860
I bet you have. How much did she pay you?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
No, Mr. Oh. Please don't get the wrong idea.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.100
- Wrong idea? - Ms. Park told me...

08:48.200 --> 08:50.169
that if I keep her updated on everything he's up to...

08:50.240 --> 08:51.399
Then, what?

08:52.799 --> 08:54.370
If I keep her updated on everything,

08:56.710 --> 08:59.440
she said that she'd raise my monthly salary by 1,000 dollars.

08:59.610 --> 09:00.610
1,000 dollars?

09:01.309 --> 09:02.509
1,000 dollars?

09:03.080 --> 09:05.480
- Don't lie to my face. - I'm telling you the truth.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.190
What is going on? Did she betray the chairman...

09:08.419 --> 09:10.120
and run away after selling all the shares?

09:10.289 --> 09:11.490
Gosh.

09:12.289 --> 09:16.059
All of us started to distrust and question each other.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.230
Because of what she had done, we could no longer tell...

09:20.100 --> 09:22.230
what was true and what was fake.

09:22.330 --> 09:23.500
Gosh, Ms. Cheon.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.940
What are you doing?

09:26.570 --> 09:28.269
I'm leaving.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.539
Ms. Park told me to leave.

09:30.610 --> 09:31.980
Gosh, I'm speechless.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.480
I guess you're leaving because you've achieved your goal.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.149
What?

09:37.379 --> 09:38.679
You can't go anywhere.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.090
- Why are you being like this? - Ms. Park!

09:42.820 --> 09:44.919
Ms. Park, this woman is running away.

09:45.389 --> 09:46.929
How shameless.

09:46.990 --> 09:49.360
- Where's Park Bok Ja? - I don't know.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.259
- Madam... - Shut it. You must know everything.

09:54.330 --> 09:56.129
She sold the company and ran away.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.039
She sold the company for 75,000,000 dollars.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.070
Did you say 75...

10:02.470 --> 10:05.909
Tell me where she is. Isn't that where you're going?

10:06.179 --> 10:07.509
How much is she giving you?

10:08.379 --> 10:11.350
Madam, I told the chairman about her past...

10:11.419 --> 10:13.850
like you had asked me to do.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.649
Why are you doing this to me?

10:15.750 --> 10:16.960
Do you think I'd have no idea?

10:17.590 --> 10:19.820
You're the type to turn your coat as you please.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.759
Ms. Jo told me that she saw you speaking with her!

10:27.370 --> 10:30.269
- I won't have a baby. - You wanted a baby though.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.700
I had a change of heart.

10:31.970 --> 10:35.669
I've found a faster way than using the baby to cash in.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.879
Then, what are your plans afterward?

10:41.009 --> 10:42.610
- Ms. Jo. - Yes, madam.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.250
This woman is her accomplice.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.850
Make sure she can't even step out of the house.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.190
What a bat.

10:53.830 --> 10:54.860
Gosh, I can't believe this.

11:03.370 --> 11:04.370
What's going on?

11:04.799 --> 11:05.970
How much did you get?

11:06.570 --> 11:07.610
What do you mean?

11:07.610 --> 11:09.840
- We heard you sold the company! - What?

11:09.909 --> 11:12.379
You punk, how dare you eat up the company all by yourself?

11:12.440 --> 11:14.049
What on earth are you talking about?

11:14.110 --> 11:16.919
The company has been sold. You must have known about it!

11:16.980 --> 11:18.620
No one sold the company.

11:18.750 --> 11:22.450
Dad gave all of his shares to that woman. That's all.

11:28.889 --> 11:29.929
Did something else happen?

11:29.990 --> 11:33.399
Ms. Park sold all of those shares to a private equity fund.

11:33.529 --> 11:35.700
- What? - The chairman told her to do so.

11:35.799 --> 11:37.370
Mr. Park, who told you that?

11:37.470 --> 11:39.399
The shareholders came by and caused a scene earlier.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.669
They'll have an emergency meeting in a bit.

11:41.740 --> 11:45.580
Why did no one discuss with me and do whatever they want?

11:45.639 --> 11:47.950
She sold the company? Who does she think she is?

11:48.049 --> 11:50.450
Look at you. You're a pretty good actor.

11:50.549 --> 11:51.980
How could you have not known about it?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.289
You scumbag. You're one of the shareholders!

11:54.350 --> 11:57.759
Do you think I'll believe they didn't discuss it with you at all?

11:57.820 --> 12:00.159
My goodness, why are you guys doing this to me?

12:00.860 --> 12:02.559
I just got divorced.

12:02.659 --> 12:04.399
That's not important now, you idiot!

12:04.529 --> 12:05.960
Give us our shares!

12:06.029 --> 12:08.129
I just got divorced!

12:08.200 --> 12:09.730
Why are you guys doing this to me?

12:10.539 --> 12:13.269
- Where is Dad? - He collapsed and is hospitalized.

12:14.740 --> 12:15.769
Gosh.

12:17.909 --> 12:18.980
What?

12:28.149 --> 12:29.250
Father.

12:38.799 --> 12:39.899
Ms. Woo.

12:40.399 --> 12:41.500
You can't get a hold of her?

12:41.899 --> 12:43.029
She said she won't come.

12:44.870 --> 12:46.100
What's happening with the company?

12:46.740 --> 12:48.340
Has it really been bought out?

12:48.509 --> 12:50.840
What I know is all of the shares Chairman Ahn used to own...

12:51.279 --> 12:52.809
have been sold.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.750
I heard that it was Father's decision.

12:59.149 --> 13:00.190
Is it true?

13:01.320 --> 13:04.519
Lawyer Kim is speaking with the shareholders at the moment.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.659
This contract here proves that the chairman gave his shares...

13:11.830 --> 13:14.169
to his wife, Park Bok Ja...

13:14.230 --> 13:15.299
I mean, Ms. Park Ji Yeong.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.470
We know that, but we heard that woman sold the company right away.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.440
To whom did she sell it? She obviously did it behind Dad's back.

13:22.539 --> 13:25.240
The chairman was the one who wanted to sell the company.

13:26.580 --> 13:28.210
No way. That can't be.

13:49.769 --> 13:51.399
As you can all see,

13:51.769 --> 13:53.070
MK Capital is now...

13:53.070 --> 13:54.370
the majority shareholder of Daesung Pulp.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.539
Since the CEO position...

13:55.539 --> 13:57.909
is vacant at the moment, I will temporarily act...

13:58.110 --> 14:00.710
as the company's CEO until the board finds a management specialist.

14:00.980 --> 14:03.779
This is crazy. This is absolutely insane.

14:04.679 --> 14:07.690
Who told you that you could run my dad's company?

14:08.049 --> 14:10.720
- Who do you think you are? - My company legally set up...

14:10.820 --> 14:14.360
the fund and bought Daesung Pulp at the highest price it can get.

14:14.559 --> 14:18.259
The payment was made to the majority shareholder, Ms. Park Ji Yeong.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.169
- Since Daesung Pulp is unlisted... - Park Ji Yeong?

14:20.230 --> 14:22.370
- She changed her name. - MK Capital doesn't need to seek...

14:22.429 --> 14:26.269
a unanimous shareholder agreement in order for its rights to commence.

14:26.710 --> 14:27.710
That's all for now.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.580
This can't happen. I mean, I had no idea.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.080
What is this?

14:37.149 --> 14:38.580
So, you know where she is now?

14:38.980 --> 14:40.750
I tracked the location of her cell phone.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.059
What would you like to do about Park Bok Ja?

14:48.830 --> 14:49.830
What should I do?

14:51.759 --> 14:52.759
Let's kill her.

14:55.529 --> 14:56.669
We have to kill her.

14:58.070 --> 14:59.769
That's the only way.

15:19.190 --> 15:23.399
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

15:23.500 --> 15:25.730
8, 9...

15:43.779 --> 15:45.019
- Hello? - Where are you?

15:45.120 --> 15:47.919
I'm on my way to catch her. I got the location of her phone.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.919
What will you do after catching her?

15:50.190 --> 15:51.960
We must get the money back at all costs.

15:53.059 --> 15:55.230
I'll beat her up to a pulp first.

15:55.389 --> 15:58.730
Forget it. I'll go get her. Just tell me where she is.

15:58.830 --> 16:00.029
You don't need to do that.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.100
You've been exposed too many times.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.440
Plus, you've failed every single time.

16:05.039 --> 16:06.240
This time, I'll do it myself.

16:07.940 --> 16:11.309
I'll just kill her if I can't get through to her.

16:12.279 --> 16:15.649
Who do you think will inherit the money if that woman dies?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.080
Father will get it all back.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.690
We must do it if it's the only way.

16:21.820 --> 16:23.620
Where is that wench right now?

16:27.090 --> 16:28.159
Jae Gu.

16:29.559 --> 16:30.600
Jae Gu.

16:33.529 --> 16:34.899
Did you really get divorced?

16:37.399 --> 16:38.399
I'm seriously devastated.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.210
You're such an idiot.

16:41.909 --> 16:44.940
By the way, Dad collapsed. Who's at the hospital now?

17:07.170 --> 17:08.868
(Woo A Jin)

17:12.740 --> 17:15.410
The customer you're calling is unavailable at the moment.

17:25.779 --> 17:26.819
Goodness.

17:27.019 --> 17:28.019
Could this be it?

17:28.118 --> 17:31.119
"Ahn Jae Seok and Yun Seong Hui have agreed to the following."

17:31.390 --> 17:33.759
"First, Ahn Jae Seok is the owner of the real estate property."

17:33.930 --> 17:36.529
"Second, Ahn transfers the equitable title of the property..."

17:36.630 --> 17:37.900
"to his trustee, Yun."

17:37.960 --> 17:39.559
My gosh, this is it.

17:39.630 --> 17:43.069
Goodness, you're an idiot. Why did you sign this thing?

17:43.130 --> 17:45.940
He said that we need to sign this to make it more concrete.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.140
Gosh, what should I do now?

17:47.240 --> 17:51.140
Gosh, he seemed so dumb. I'm surprised he covered all the bases.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.240
What should I do?

17:52.609 --> 17:54.910
He must have another copy of this.

17:55.410 --> 17:58.220
All problems will be solved if we find it and get rid of it, right?

17:58.450 --> 18:02.349
You're right. Then, I'll look for it in his wife's room.

18:03.019 --> 18:04.619
The housekeeper is here.

18:13.599 --> 18:14.769
Miss.

18:15.029 --> 18:18.500
I have a bad headache. Do you mind picking up some medicine for me?

18:18.970 --> 18:22.269
You nuthead. Why should I step out and pick up medicine for you?

18:22.369 --> 18:24.940
How unsophisticated. Do you have to talk like that?

18:25.109 --> 18:26.279
Whatever.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.609
Don't be like that. Please do it for me.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.480
You've been racking that sly brain of yours.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.180
Of course, it will shut down.

18:32.650 --> 18:34.150
No wonder you have a headache.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.019
Gosh, my head...

18:52.400 --> 18:55.269
- Does it hurt a lot? - Gosh, it's splitting.

18:55.470 --> 18:57.680
Really? Then, go and see who's here.

18:57.940 --> 18:59.539
It'll completely get rid of your headache.

19:01.180 --> 19:02.410
Who is here?

19:07.190 --> 19:11.220
"Campaign for Better Residential Environment"?

19:12.619 --> 19:16.589
We'd like to speak with the mistress that lives here.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.859
Pardon? Whom are you referring to?

19:20.470 --> 19:21.900
She's her mom.

19:23.569 --> 19:24.569
Who are you ladies?

19:24.640 --> 19:28.970
I'm the chairwoman of the Campaign for Better Residential Environment.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.410
We'd like to speak with the mistress.

19:31.609 --> 19:33.109
Please let us talk to her directly.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.279
What is going on?

19:36.049 --> 19:38.720
- What do you ladies want? - UN Top Village has been named...

19:38.819 --> 19:40.690
the best residential complex in the whole country...

19:40.750 --> 19:41.819
for two consecutive years...

19:41.890 --> 19:44.190
since I was elected to represent our residents.

19:44.259 --> 19:46.759
It's known as a premium-class, prestigious residential complex.

19:46.890 --> 19:49.589
In other words, this crazy situation where a wife and a mistress...

19:49.690 --> 19:52.230
are living together in our building has significantly damaged...

19:52.299 --> 19:55.730
the complex's image and reputation, and I absolutely cannot condone...

19:55.799 --> 19:58.000
such ridiculousness as the representative of all residents.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.970
- What did you just say? - Take pictures.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.640
What do you think you're doing now?

20:04.740 --> 20:07.980
Look, you are breaking the law now. Are you aware of it or not?

20:08.049 --> 20:10.319
Of course, we're aware of it.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.950
You have no right to do this to me.

20:13.390 --> 20:15.049
You're violating the law...

20:15.049 --> 20:16.690
by taking pictures of me and invading my property.

20:16.690 --> 20:19.720
Do you all want to end up in jail or what?

20:20.559 --> 20:21.730
Oh, my goodness.

20:22.059 --> 20:25.400
I see that mistresses these days are different.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.029
They're definitely smart.

20:27.630 --> 20:29.069
- How smart. - How smart.

20:29.130 --> 20:32.369
Hey, you mistress! Move out of our building immediately!

20:32.440 --> 20:34.170
- What? - We'll give you exactly 15 days.

20:34.269 --> 20:36.440
If you don't move out by then, we'll disseminate these photos.

20:36.509 --> 20:38.839
You talked about the law earlier, but you should be more scared...

20:38.940 --> 20:40.609
of enraging all married women in this country.

20:41.009 --> 20:43.720
With that being said, we would like you...

20:43.819 --> 20:46.690
to move out of our building as soon as possible.

20:48.250 --> 20:49.849
All right, ladies. Let's go to Unit 804 now.

20:49.950 --> 20:50.960
Yes.

20:50.990 --> 20:52.819
Their dogs have been causing problems.

20:52.890 --> 20:56.059
They have eight dogs that bark constantly.

20:56.759 --> 20:58.160
We'll get going then.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.599
Your head must be really splitting now.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.509
Shall I pick up some medicine for you?

21:54.220 --> 21:55.950
(Missed Call: Woo A Jin)

22:08.099 --> 22:09.670
- Is this where she is? - Yes.

22:09.970 --> 22:11.900
The location of her phone showed up at this hotel.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.339
She must be in a suite.

22:13.769 --> 22:16.140
That's my guess from a psychological perspective.

22:16.339 --> 22:19.740
There are security cameras in every hallway. We can't drag her out.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.150
What's your plan?

22:24.250 --> 22:26.720
We should lure her out of the room.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.190
Give this to the front desk.

22:34.690 --> 22:36.960
Tell them to give it to Ms. Park Ji Yeong in the suite.

22:41.329 --> 22:42.400
I saw this coming.

22:44.569 --> 22:46.200
What did I tell you?

22:48.670 --> 22:49.710
I told you...

22:50.980 --> 22:52.880
that she needs to leave.

22:53.980 --> 22:55.880
Why didn't you listen to me?

23:02.549 --> 23:03.559
Father.

23:05.619 --> 23:07.960
I'm not your daughter-in-law anymore.

23:21.009 --> 23:22.210
Mr. Kang, I have a question.

23:23.009 --> 23:26.609
I wasn't going to say anything about this as it's just my speculation,

23:27.049 --> 23:28.509
but about Ms. Woo's case...

23:29.910 --> 23:33.250
Lawsuits for divorce, division of property, and child custody...

23:33.490 --> 23:35.349
are usually done together in most cases like hers.

23:35.950 --> 23:37.559
Shouldn't we have done that?

23:38.519 --> 23:42.130
Why were you in such a rush to get her divorced?

23:42.359 --> 23:45.259
Gosh, what are you talking about? Don't be silly.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.900
You seemed to be in a rush to make her a divorcee.

23:49.299 --> 23:50.799
It was intentional, wasn't it?

23:50.900 --> 23:53.440
- No. What are you thinking? - Don't deny it.

23:53.769 --> 23:56.210
I just thought combining them together would slow things down.

23:56.309 --> 23:59.609
Exactly. Didn't you rush it so that you can stop feeling anxious?

24:02.450 --> 24:03.519
No, not at all.

24:08.390 --> 24:10.759
Right, that was expected.

24:12.190 --> 24:16.359
By the way, Mr. Han, I think I need to hire a personal bodyguard.

24:16.529 --> 24:18.660
Could you send me somebody you can trust?

24:20.769 --> 24:24.599
Also, don't try any tricks with me.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.640
You know we're in the same boat.

24:29.609 --> 24:30.680
Yes, all right.

24:50.799 --> 24:51.829
Hello?

24:57.970 --> 24:59.500
We should go see Dad at the hospital.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.140
Go by yourself.

25:01.369 --> 25:04.680
I'll meet that man, Mr. Han...

25:05.140 --> 25:07.049
and try to find a way to get the company back.

25:07.279 --> 25:09.650
How on earth are we going to get it back?

25:09.880 --> 25:11.680
Are you saying we should just let them take it?

25:12.019 --> 25:13.390
I can't do that.

25:14.750 --> 25:17.119
I wish I could turn back the hands of time.

25:18.359 --> 25:19.359
Where are you going?

25:20.130 --> 25:23.460
If we want to catch a tiger, we must go into its den.

25:24.130 --> 25:25.960
Digging a rabbit hole won't help us in any way.

25:40.809 --> 25:43.579
(I'll wait for you 50m diagonally away from...)

25:43.680 --> 25:46.319
(the hotel's main entrance. See you at 9pm.)

25:53.960 --> 25:56.029
(Woo A Jin)

26:03.069 --> 26:04.240
What brings you here?

26:04.339 --> 26:05.400
What do you think?

26:06.339 --> 26:07.769
I came to make sure you eat something.

26:07.940 --> 26:08.970
You're hungry, right?

26:09.640 --> 26:11.509
How did you know that I'd be hungry?

26:11.910 --> 26:13.509
Because I'm hungry.

26:15.910 --> 26:16.980
That's how we are.

26:17.119 --> 26:19.619
You're hungry when I'm hungry.

26:22.819 --> 26:24.190
He's still unconscious.

26:25.660 --> 26:29.029
By the way, why are his children not here?

26:45.279 --> 26:47.480
- Dad... - Couldn't you have come sooner?

26:47.549 --> 26:50.279
I've been so out of it because I just got divorced.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.450
Didn't I get divorced too?

26:57.890 --> 26:59.089
Why are you here?

26:59.390 --> 27:01.359
I'm leaving. Let's go.

27:01.430 --> 27:03.799
- Let's eat this outside. - Where are you going?

27:04.029 --> 27:05.859
You can't leave. Who will look after Dad?

27:05.930 --> 27:07.029
Are you drunk?

27:07.269 --> 27:09.930
I mean, have you been drinking in broad daylight, Mr. Ahn Jae Seok?

27:10.099 --> 27:13.940
I really don't need to stay here and look after your father, Mr. Ahn.

27:14.009 --> 27:15.069
Of course, I should leave.

27:15.170 --> 27:19.009
Besides, he has three children. How could he be alone?

27:19.109 --> 27:20.750
I can't believe you just showed up.

27:20.809 --> 27:22.980
Don't leave. Stay here with me.

27:26.619 --> 27:28.349
I'm totally distraught, dear.

27:28.549 --> 27:31.319
A Jin, I'm going to break up with her. Let's...

27:31.390 --> 27:32.589
You scumbag.

27:32.759 --> 27:34.259
What? Scumbag?

27:34.660 --> 27:37.359
Your father is bedridden. Let's not do this in front of him.

27:40.930 --> 27:42.569
Where are you two going together?

27:43.869 --> 27:46.369
By any chance, are you two seeing each other?

27:47.710 --> 27:49.269
They say, you only see what you know.

27:54.549 --> 27:58.119
Why do they look so close though? It's annoying me.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.759
- Where are you heading now? - I should go home.

28:07.490 --> 28:09.789
Take this. You should eat it at home with Ji Hu.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.160
Thanks, partner.

28:35.519 --> 28:37.460
- Hello. - How much did you pay?

28:37.460 --> 28:39.519
Do you know what this company means to us? This is crazy.

28:39.619 --> 28:43.630
I heard Chairman Ahn didn't want to pass it down to his children.

28:43.829 --> 28:45.859
- What did you say? - It looks like he wanted to turn...

28:45.930 --> 28:48.769
everything he owned into cash and enjoy his remaining years.

28:49.029 --> 28:51.400
- Well, what I'm saying is... - Try to think about why he did it.

28:55.809 --> 28:58.079
Do you want to get the company back?

29:17.900 --> 29:19.660
Did you give the note to Ms. Park?

29:19.829 --> 29:22.200
She left her reply here with me.

29:33.410 --> 29:35.410
Let's make it an hour later.

29:44.519 --> 29:45.519
- It's freezing. - Get in.

29:46.890 --> 29:51.000
That crazy wench is doing a long-term stay at Saint Palace.

29:51.400 --> 29:54.170
- I mean, that's all our money. - Shall we just drag her out?

29:54.299 --> 29:55.329
Hey.

29:55.730 --> 29:57.670
Do you guys have nothing better to wear?

29:58.539 --> 30:02.009
You guys won't even get a key to a room dressed like that.

30:03.309 --> 30:05.210
We can do anything if you pay us.

30:06.140 --> 30:07.150
That's true.

30:29.230 --> 30:30.900
- Is it good? - Yes, it's delicious.

30:31.740 --> 30:32.869
- Ji Hu. - Yes?

30:34.009 --> 30:35.269
No, never mind.

30:35.769 --> 30:37.180
Let's just eat this today.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.309
Tomorrow will be another day, right?

30:40.049 --> 30:43.420
You're implying that you're not happy with how things are today.

30:44.619 --> 30:45.750
Right, I'm a little unhappy.

30:46.079 --> 30:47.420
The sun is the same every day.

30:47.490 --> 30:49.990
We just can't see it from time to time because of the clouds.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.190
Mom, cheer up.

30:57.329 --> 30:58.400
Ji Hu.

30:58.829 --> 31:00.170
I hope you don't hate Dad.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.000
I hope you don't hate him.

31:02.670 --> 31:04.440
I can't help it.

31:04.569 --> 31:05.569
It's understandable.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.039
I'm sorry.

31:07.369 --> 31:09.710
I feel bad that I'm telling you things like this when I'm your mom.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.240
Becoming a parent...

31:12.440 --> 31:15.250
doesn't mean you become a deity.

31:15.849 --> 31:18.650
You're the best, Mom. I give you 100 out of 100.

31:19.519 --> 31:20.690
I don't deserve that.

31:20.819 --> 31:23.019
I even get Aunt Jin Hee to pick you up.

31:23.250 --> 31:25.119
I'm pretty generous.

31:25.190 --> 31:26.859
Yes, I know that.

31:32.029 --> 31:33.099
Ji Hu.

31:34.099 --> 31:36.500
Grandpa collapsed.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.869
Really? What should we do?

31:39.099 --> 31:40.910
Pray for him to regain his consciousness soon.

31:41.309 --> 31:43.380
You said your prayers work.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.039
Okay, I'll definitely pray for him.

31:45.980 --> 31:49.109
But I don't really think my prayers are working these days.

31:50.019 --> 31:52.579
I prayed that things between you and Dad would get better.

31:53.420 --> 31:55.220
Maybe the deity is busy these days.

31:55.220 --> 31:56.619
You should pester him more.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.420
All right, I will.

31:59.660 --> 32:01.890
I really hope Grandpa is okay.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.460
I know that we're used to...

32:07.170 --> 32:10.869
living in a big house and going on a trip abroad every year,

32:11.000 --> 32:12.799
but we may not be able to live like that anymore.

32:16.039 --> 32:17.309
It's also possible...

32:18.140 --> 32:19.210
that I may no longer...

32:19.339 --> 32:21.450
be able to have Aunt Jin Hee pick you up and give you rides.

32:21.750 --> 32:22.980
That's totally fine.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.279
My baby, you're such a strong girl.

32:26.019 --> 32:27.750
Finish this quickly, and go to bed early.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.420
I have to step out after you fall asleep.

32:29.549 --> 32:32.190
- To the war zone? - That's right, the war zone.

32:43.099 --> 32:44.140
Hello?

32:45.940 --> 32:46.940
What's the matter?

32:47.569 --> 32:48.569
Yes, so what?

32:51.039 --> 32:52.339
Let's talk at home.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.049
Stop calling me. I have to go.

33:08.460 --> 33:11.559
What? He wants to end it? He wants to break up with me?

33:13.670 --> 33:16.670
I should be saying that. How dare he beat me to it?

33:34.589 --> 33:36.960
Seong Hui, I got it open.

33:53.569 --> 33:56.680
(January 12th, 2017. Today, I went to play with Jin Hee...)

33:56.740 --> 33:59.910
(January 13th, 2017. I learned volleyball for the first time...)

34:22.969 --> 34:24.000
What should we do?

34:25.170 --> 34:26.199
Yes.

34:27.369 --> 34:28.440
Okay, got it.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.510
What did he say?

34:30.639 --> 34:32.909
He told me to go to the 19th floor through the emergency exit.

34:32.980 --> 34:34.050
Why?

34:34.679 --> 34:37.349
He said she's in one of the suites there.

34:37.449 --> 34:39.050
Then, why did we get off here?

34:39.150 --> 34:40.650
Because of the security cameras, you idiot.

34:41.389 --> 34:42.449
Keep your voice down.

35:01.070 --> 35:04.110
I'll wait for you 50m diagonally away from the hotel's main entrance.

35:04.309 --> 35:05.980
See you at 9pm. Woo A Jin.

35:06.110 --> 35:08.179
Let's make it an hour later.

35:36.909 --> 35:38.010
What should we do?

35:38.440 --> 35:42.480
It doesn't look like things will go according to your plan.

35:45.650 --> 35:47.150
Room service.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.429
(Saint Palace Hotel)

36:12.840 --> 36:15.510
Gosh, wait. Just a moment.

36:15.610 --> 36:16.780
Who are you guys?

36:20.820 --> 36:23.519
Just follow us quietly. Then, we won't hurt you.

36:23.860 --> 36:25.860
Wait, just give me a second.

36:27.030 --> 36:29.190
All right, I heard you guys.

36:29.559 --> 36:32.730
Please just let me finish the wine before I go with you guys, okay?

36:35.030 --> 36:37.469
I will follow you guys. By the way,

36:37.900 --> 36:40.210
you've never slept in a hotel suite, have you?

36:40.710 --> 36:43.780
At a place like this, you need to drink expensive alcohol...

36:44.179 --> 36:45.940
and take pictures.

36:46.010 --> 36:47.409
Don't you dare try to trick us.

36:50.650 --> 36:52.949
Just let me have one more glass before we go.

37:12.800 --> 37:13.940
Gosh, what is going on?

37:23.309 --> 37:24.380
Who are you?

37:30.119 --> 37:31.159
Ms. Woo A Jin?

37:35.289 --> 37:38.659
I know A Jin's handwriting very well.

37:40.699 --> 37:42.900
Aren't you a professor?

37:43.440 --> 37:45.500
How can you be so inept and shortsighted?

37:51.179 --> 37:52.340
Park Bok Ja.

37:53.010 --> 37:55.349
You said you met Park Ji Yeong for the first time...

37:55.750 --> 37:57.650
when you interviewed her for the caregiver position,

37:57.719 --> 38:01.550
but we found out that the two of you go way back.

38:02.019 --> 38:04.489
You met her for the first time...

38:04.590 --> 38:07.429
at the hotel where she stayed long-term...

38:08.130 --> 38:09.460
after she disappeared with the money...

38:10.460 --> 38:12.099
from selling the company.

38:14.630 --> 38:17.000
Do you not remember?

38:35.949 --> 38:36.989
Hello?

38:39.289 --> 38:40.360
Yes.

38:44.300 --> 38:47.130
Thanks for everything.

38:48.630 --> 38:51.599
Please wrap it up well, and I'll see you soon.

38:53.940 --> 38:54.940
All right.

38:55.909 --> 38:56.940
Bye.

39:30.710 --> 39:32.510
- What are you two doing here now? - Gosh!

39:35.849 --> 39:37.349
- Let's talk. - Go ahead.

39:37.420 --> 39:39.679
I'll leave your husband.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.550
Do it. It's none of my business though.

39:41.619 --> 39:44.219
So, give me back my paintings.

39:46.190 --> 39:47.889
You said you'd keep them because I took him.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.929
I'll give your husband back to you,

39:50.260 --> 39:52.400
so give me back my paintings.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.170
Ms. Yun Seong Hui.

39:55.199 --> 39:58.969
How will you succeed as an artist when you're this clueless?

39:59.199 --> 40:00.239
What?

40:03.010 --> 40:05.980
When you and my husband started having an affair,

40:06.139 --> 40:08.380
his value skyrocketed.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.780
Simply put, his price was the highest back then,

40:11.880 --> 40:14.289
but his value has plummeted since that time.

40:14.949 --> 40:17.119
The problem is that our transaction was done...

40:17.219 --> 40:19.719
when his price was at its highest.

40:19.889 --> 40:21.429
Have you never bought a real estate property?

40:22.130 --> 40:23.630
Can you annul the contract...

40:23.630 --> 40:26.059
just because the value is dropping after you bought it?

40:26.199 --> 40:27.269
You can't.

40:27.369 --> 40:29.199
What kind of nonsense is that?

40:29.269 --> 40:31.070
A person and a real estate property aren't the same.

40:31.199 --> 40:32.670
Of course, they're different.

40:32.739 --> 40:35.610
How can we compare a person to a real estate property?

40:36.070 --> 40:38.710
I was trying to cater to the level of your thinking as well as...

40:38.809 --> 40:41.980
your values and moral standards in order to get through to you,

40:42.150 --> 40:43.920
but you still don't seem to get it.

40:44.519 --> 40:46.920
Compensation for emotional distress!

40:47.420 --> 40:48.650
Have you ever heard of it?

40:49.519 --> 40:52.920
My strong self-esteem which I had been maintaining so well...

40:53.489 --> 40:55.989
and my castle called a family were both destroyed by you.

40:56.159 --> 41:00.570
You think your paintings are enough to compensate me for all of that?

41:00.829 --> 41:03.170
If you were to compensate me for everything you did to me,

41:03.539 --> 41:07.269
you'd have to keep painting nonstop for the rest of your life.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.510
Do you know that?

41:10.480 --> 41:11.809
I'm speechless.

41:12.409 --> 41:14.380
Now, you're speechless?

41:14.849 --> 41:17.519
I've done nothing to be ashamed of. I can tell the whole world.

41:18.050 --> 41:21.019
Where's the proof that your husband and I had an affair?

41:21.719 --> 41:23.920
I know that you're planning to sell my paintings...

41:24.119 --> 41:26.460
when the prices jump after I become famous.

41:27.090 --> 41:28.789
I'll tell all media outlets...

41:29.159 --> 41:30.829
that you stole them from me.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.929
Look, Ms. Yun Seong Hui.

41:36.599 --> 41:39.699
When a person who is indebted to someone...

41:39.969 --> 41:42.340
deliberately changes ownership of a property...

41:42.409 --> 41:44.780
or secretly extracts it, we call it a fraudulent act.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.280
That's what you did...

41:46.280 --> 41:49.050
with this house, and that's why I sent you the petition.

41:49.579 --> 41:53.389
I'm only keeping your paintings for the time being...

41:53.449 --> 41:55.690
to make sure that you can't commit other fraudulent acts...

41:55.750 --> 41:57.719
prior to my alimony suit.

41:58.789 --> 42:00.159
Are you following?

42:00.630 --> 42:03.030
Also, did you say I stole them?

42:03.699 --> 42:06.059
You're the thief, not me.

42:06.260 --> 42:07.670
You stole my husband from me!

42:08.469 --> 42:10.469
Just live happily ever after with Ahn Jae Seok,

42:10.599 --> 42:13.300
and keep painting.

42:14.139 --> 42:17.079
That's why I let you use the living room as your studio.

42:17.639 --> 42:19.510
I must have done it for a reason, don't you think?

42:20.949 --> 42:23.519
Look, Ms. Woo. You're out of line.

42:23.619 --> 42:24.920
You're one to talk.

42:25.119 --> 42:27.849
Also, who gave you the right to come here whenever you want?

42:27.849 --> 42:30.559
This place is a war zone where...

42:30.619 --> 42:33.289
your daughter and I are fiercely fighting against each other.

42:33.630 --> 42:36.829
It's not fair at all to bring an ally into the game like this.

42:36.929 --> 42:37.960
One more thing.

42:38.260 --> 42:41.570
If you ransack my room like this once again,

42:41.829 --> 42:43.769
I'll disseminate your daughter's pictures.

42:44.699 --> 42:46.000
What do you think you're doing now?

42:46.440 --> 42:48.710
What do you think? I'm threatening you.

42:49.110 --> 42:50.340
Get out immediately!

42:51.710 --> 42:54.179
It's so nice to get together at night like this.

42:55.150 --> 42:57.449
We can chat as much as we want without worrying about work.

42:59.019 --> 43:01.690
By the way, did Park Bok Ja really flee?

43:02.050 --> 43:05.289
Don't even get me started. It's a complete disaster right now.

43:05.420 --> 43:08.389
- They should report to the police. - The police can't do anything...

43:08.630 --> 43:09.789
because she did nothing wrong.

43:10.429 --> 43:11.699
It's so crazy.

43:11.760 --> 43:14.000
Apparently, Chairman Ahn gave her all of his shares...

43:14.130 --> 43:17.000
and even told her to sell the company.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.039
- What? - What?

43:18.039 --> 43:20.269
It's neither considered fraud nor embezzlement.

43:21.010 --> 43:23.039
She just sold her shares.

43:23.309 --> 43:25.480
Why did he trust her so much?

43:26.139 --> 43:29.349
He was totally bewitched by her.

43:29.449 --> 43:30.750
That's what I'm saying.

43:31.750 --> 43:33.349
By the way, why isn't Yeo Ul here yet?

43:33.690 --> 43:35.019
She got fired.

43:35.489 --> 43:36.489
What do you mean?

43:37.090 --> 43:38.219
Well, what happened was...

43:39.059 --> 43:41.090
Two days ago, the chairman's wife wanted to speak with her.

43:41.090 --> 43:42.260
Then, she asked out of the blue,

43:42.360 --> 43:44.630
"What have you been saying to people?"

43:46.429 --> 43:47.429
Goodness.

43:47.429 --> 43:49.070
"How does the wife of Wansan Trade's president..."

43:49.130 --> 43:51.570
"know about my son being investigated by the prosecution?"

43:51.769 --> 43:53.000
"It's Pungsuk's Kitchen, isn't it?"

43:54.010 --> 43:56.809
Come to think of it, Pung Suk has been acting...

43:57.110 --> 43:59.679
a bit suspiciously for some time now.

43:59.780 --> 44:02.550
Did you just notice that now? You should watch what you say.

44:02.880 --> 44:06.349
She's a lot closer with those rich ladies than we are.

44:07.250 --> 44:08.519
My gosh.

44:08.690 --> 44:11.360
Then, where can we go to vent from now on?

44:11.889 --> 44:14.030
But we usually gossip when she's not around.

44:14.659 --> 44:16.289
How does she even know?

44:19.030 --> 44:22.099
What if she planted a bug somewhere?

44:26.639 --> 44:29.510
Have you ladies heard about what's going on at Mr. Kim's place?

44:39.219 --> 44:40.750
Bong Sik, what happened?

44:42.590 --> 44:44.289
You didn't beat him up, did you?

44:45.090 --> 44:46.260
Mun Tak.

44:48.059 --> 44:49.130
It's so...

44:50.730 --> 44:51.730
It's ridiculous.

44:52.059 --> 44:54.900
- What do you mean? - I went to beat him into a pulp.

44:55.300 --> 44:58.300
I mean, I thought he deserved to get what was done to me.

44:58.599 --> 45:00.769
- Then, what happened? - But...

45:02.039 --> 45:03.440
- Bye! - Bye. See you all tomorrow.

45:03.510 --> 45:05.139
- See you. - All right. Get home safely.

45:06.010 --> 45:07.179
- Hello. - Nonhyeon-dong, please.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.010
- Sure, no problem. - Here you go.

45:16.920 --> 45:18.260
- Honey... - Don't do this, Mr. Kim.

45:19.059 --> 45:20.289
This won't resolve anything.

45:21.130 --> 45:22.289
- Move! - It wasn't me!

45:22.289 --> 45:24.199
You deserve this, you jerk. I'll break your ribs...

45:24.260 --> 45:25.699
I'm not the one who beat you up!

45:25.699 --> 45:27.929
This is what you get for sleeping with my wife!

46:07.639 --> 46:08.769
Let's end it now.

46:10.210 --> 46:11.809
I'm fine with us ending it,

46:13.510 --> 46:14.750
but when I think about your wife,

46:16.150 --> 46:17.420
I feel so bad.

46:20.489 --> 46:22.150
Enough feeling that way. Let's stop now.

46:22.949 --> 46:24.019
You should leave.

46:24.119 --> 46:25.519
Let's not see each other anymore.

46:41.239 --> 46:42.369
You're home.

46:44.079 --> 46:45.909
- Have you heard? - What?

46:46.280 --> 46:49.409
Dr. Jang's wife is injured. She's at a hospital now.

46:50.250 --> 46:53.280
What did you just say? Gosh. Which hospital?

46:56.519 --> 46:57.690
Dad, goodness.

46:57.889 --> 46:59.519
I knew that something like this would happen.

46:59.860 --> 47:01.960
Dad, why on earth did you do that?

47:03.530 --> 47:06.500
Why were you so bewitched by her? Why did you even trust that woman?

47:06.829 --> 47:08.530
You definitely deserve all this.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.469
Gosh.

47:14.869 --> 47:15.909
Dad.

47:17.639 --> 47:18.739
I...

47:20.409 --> 47:21.579
I got divorced.

47:23.619 --> 47:24.780
What should I do now?

47:31.489 --> 47:33.659
Do you want to get the company back?

47:37.630 --> 47:40.099
Why didn't you pick up? I was so worried.

47:45.800 --> 47:46.969
That wench...

47:48.869 --> 47:50.510
I'll really kill her.

47:51.010 --> 47:52.079
Did you find her?

47:52.409 --> 47:53.980
Did you figure out where that woman is now?

47:54.750 --> 47:56.750
Madam, we've arrived at your place.

48:00.650 --> 48:02.420
What would you like me to do with those two guys?

48:02.750 --> 48:04.690
Who are you?

48:06.190 --> 48:07.789
I'm Ms. Park Ji Yeong's bodyguard.

48:08.460 --> 48:09.760
What happened to him?

48:09.929 --> 48:10.960
Who?

48:12.099 --> 48:13.130
Mr. Gu Bong Cheol?

48:14.469 --> 48:16.269
He got beaten up to a pulp. He's at a hospital now.

48:17.269 --> 48:20.940
These two aren't in the system, and their nationality is unknown.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.969
They can't be admitted to any hospitals.

48:24.480 --> 48:25.980
It looks like you have to look after them.

48:26.239 --> 48:29.179
Who are these guys?

48:29.250 --> 48:30.650
Ahn Jae Gu will know.

48:31.880 --> 48:32.949
I should go.

48:37.889 --> 48:40.260
- It's just so strange. - What's strange?

48:40.360 --> 48:41.630
The person...

48:42.860 --> 48:45.530
who told me that wench was there...

48:46.300 --> 48:47.300
was Mr. Oh.

48:48.429 --> 48:50.139
- Mr. Oh? - But...

48:51.139 --> 48:52.170
that wench...

48:54.670 --> 48:56.239
knew I was coming.

48:56.639 --> 48:57.710
What does that mean?

48:58.110 --> 49:00.349
Do you think that Mr. Oh is on that woman's side?

49:10.389 --> 49:14.289
- Hey. - I told you not to do anything!

49:20.130 --> 49:21.900
Please continue to help me out.

49:24.639 --> 49:25.940
Of course.

49:26.239 --> 49:28.110
And please keep a watchful eye on Mr. Han.

49:28.269 --> 49:29.269
Please don't worry.

49:30.280 --> 49:33.650
But I don't feel good about telling Mr. Ahn Jae Gu...

49:34.010 --> 49:35.380
where you are.

49:35.909 --> 49:38.849
I did it because you asked me to, but he may come again.

49:38.980 --> 49:40.889
That guy doesn't scare me at all.

49:41.389 --> 49:43.360
You should be careful though.

49:44.059 --> 49:46.559
He'll be suspicious of you unless he's a total idiot.

49:47.559 --> 49:50.559
If he confronts you and talks nonsense, just tell him...

49:51.159 --> 49:53.369
that you're being paid to follow my orders.

49:55.769 --> 49:57.139
I was just kidding.

50:01.139 --> 50:04.280
Ahn Jae Gu, Ahn Jae Hui, and Ahn Jae Seok.

50:04.940 --> 50:06.949
All of them are nothing, but complete morons.

50:09.650 --> 50:11.380
I feel bad for Chairman Ahn.

50:11.780 --> 50:13.719
- I should get going. - Wait.

50:16.320 --> 50:18.119
Has he still not regained his consciousness?

50:18.559 --> 50:19.619
No.

50:19.989 --> 50:21.630
Who's staying at the hospital?

50:21.889 --> 50:23.900
Ms. Woo was there.

50:26.630 --> 50:27.670
That woman...

50:28.800 --> 50:30.469
is very cool, isn't she?

50:31.239 --> 50:32.269
Pardon?

50:33.739 --> 50:34.739
Never mind.

50:35.570 --> 50:36.570
You should get going.

51:09.469 --> 51:11.239
Is this why you lent me money without any condition...

51:11.309 --> 51:12.780
when I was opening my shop?

51:12.880 --> 51:14.280
Do you think that makes sense?

51:14.809 --> 51:17.480
I wouldn't have done that if I had known this would happen.

51:18.050 --> 51:20.519
The end result of this will be amazing. Wait for it.

51:28.530 --> 51:29.590
I'm sorry.

52:41.829 --> 52:42.829
Come out.

52:47.670 --> 52:49.170
Where are we going now?

52:49.639 --> 52:51.079
You want to kill that wench, don't you?

52:52.340 --> 52:54.380
- Does this mean that you trust me? - No.

52:55.050 --> 52:56.820
I'll trust you if you kill her.

53:04.420 --> 53:05.719
Do you really not remember?

53:06.590 --> 53:09.659
The suite at Saint Palace Hotel.

53:13.469 --> 53:15.269
I do remember now.

54:18.429 --> 54:20.630
I'm scared. Come home now.

54:21.400 --> 54:23.130
I hate thunderstorms.

54:23.329 --> 54:26.969
A Jin must be there, so why are you scared?

54:28.269 --> 54:30.639
My dad collapsed, and he's still unconscious.

54:33.980 --> 54:36.510
Wait, is A Jin not home?

54:36.780 --> 54:39.219
No, she's not here. She went out.

54:39.380 --> 54:41.250
Where on earth did she go this late?

54:41.949 --> 54:43.320
How do I know?

55:00.570 --> 55:01.570
No, no way.

55:02.440 --> 55:03.780
What if they're seeing each other?

55:04.239 --> 55:06.750
No, there's no way. A Jin wouldn't do that.

55:07.250 --> 55:08.349
Actually,

55:08.710 --> 55:10.550
you never know what can happen between a man and a woman.

55:12.119 --> 55:13.690
What was that jerk's number?

55:14.289 --> 55:16.820
(Lawyer Kang Gi Ho)

55:20.159 --> 55:21.230
Hello?

55:26.800 --> 55:29.730
(Queen Bee)

55:36.610 --> 55:38.280
Why isn't she picking up?

55:42.949 --> 55:45.679
I'm sorry, Dad. I have to step out for a bit.

56:11.380 --> 56:14.510
By the way, was Mr. Ahn Tae Dong unconscious...

56:15.079 --> 56:17.920
the whole time before Park Ji Yeong came back?

56:39.940 --> 56:40.969
Yes.

56:41.769 --> 56:43.940
He didn't regain his consciousness.

56:44.239 --> 56:46.480
(Ahn Tae Dong, Ahn Jae Gu, Park Ju Mi)

56:49.480 --> 56:53.150
(Ahn Jae Hui, Cheon Bang Soon, Gu Bong Cheol)

56:53.250 --> 56:55.789
(Han Min Gi, Oh Pung Suk)

56:58.760 --> 57:01.559
The eighth suspect, Oh Pung Suk.

57:02.960 --> 57:05.559
She runs a members-only kitchen in Dogok-dong, Gangnam.

57:05.659 --> 57:09.000
She makes and sells side dishes. It's called Pungsuk's Kitchen.

57:09.170 --> 57:11.099
It's suspected that she and Ms. Park Ji Yeong...

57:11.199 --> 57:13.940
were hostile toward each other for some complicated reasons,

57:14.440 --> 57:16.139
and she's also the one...

57:16.340 --> 57:18.940
who sent the last text message on Ms. Park's phone.

57:20.449 --> 57:21.510
Father.

57:24.320 --> 57:25.320
Bok Ja.

57:26.480 --> 57:28.489
Where is she now?

57:56.210 --> 57:58.079
(The Lady in Dignity)

57:58.650 --> 58:00.789
I'm not going to wake up.

58:00.920 --> 58:04.360
Let's keep this a secret between us.

58:04.590 --> 58:06.960
I become weak-willed when I see a woman I'm attracted to.

58:07.030 --> 58:08.559
You should help us, Mr. Han.

58:08.659 --> 58:10.960
You can use Chairman Ahn's cash or real estate property...

58:10.960 --> 58:13.530
as a collateral and take a loan out from a bank.

58:13.599 --> 58:16.099
Both Father and that wench...

58:16.530 --> 58:18.369
Tell them both to die!

58:18.869 --> 58:20.510
I didn't know it would come to this.

58:21.070 --> 58:22.309
Please forgive me.

58:22.570 --> 58:23.639
I'm sorry.

58:24.809 --> 58:26.079
Do you have feelings for my wife?

58:26.179 --> 58:28.780
How could a man not have feelings for a woman like her?

58:28.849 --> 58:30.820
I do like her very much.

58:30.920 --> 58:34.619
Let's break up. My life has been ruined after I met you.

58:34.619 --> 58:36.420
It's my life that has been ruined.

58:36.590 --> 58:37.760
Did you just hit me?

58:37.960 --> 58:40.460
He decided to give you his shares in his state of dementia...

58:40.460 --> 58:42.789
- caused by Alzheimer's disease. - Alzheimer's disease?

58:43.730 --> 58:45.900
The money you took and that diagnosis.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.170
This is the reality.

58:47.230 --> 58:49.230
A fake deserves a fake.

58:49.670 --> 58:51.739
You shouldn't have trusted me.

58:52.199 --> 58:54.710
You shouldn't have fallen for me.

58:54.769 --> 58:57.539
If you do anything stupid, I'll kill you and go to jail.

58:57.610 --> 58:59.309
- What do you want? - Money.

58:59.679 --> 59:01.449
- If you become greedy, - No!

59:01.550 --> 59:03.380
it will only end in destruction.

59:03.579 --> 59:06.619
I went through all that to get my hands on this.
