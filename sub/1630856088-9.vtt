WEBVTT

00:07.799 --> 00:10.302
<i>Well, it's a beautiful day.</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:13.013
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:15.307 --> 00:16.808
I'd say it's...

00:17.726 --> 00:19.645
weather's gonna take us to the weekend.

00:19.645 --> 00:20.729
Oh, yeah.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.397
So...

00:23.232 --> 00:25.067
Hey, buddy, cereal. Come on.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.242
I think it's about that time, pal.

00:33.242 --> 00:36.119
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.457
Little man, we are off to work.

00:41.917 --> 00:42.918
Okay.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.798
Now, your mimi is gonna be
watching you today.

00:48.632 --> 00:52.386
And-- Well, me and your uncle Lee,

00:52.386 --> 00:54.763
we'll see you when he
gets back from his trip.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.473
Where's he going?

01:00.686 --> 01:03.522
I'll let your uncle Lee
fill you in on that. Okay?

01:03.522 --> 01:04.647
Come here.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.762
You know that it's top secret
army-explorer stuff, right?

01:38.765 --> 01:40.559
Is it dangerous?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.396
Well, we're doing it
for the good of the world.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.315
You know, trying to keep everybody safe.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.487
I guess what we do
is always a little dangerous.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.075
Well, you know all about that, right?

01:58.702 --> 01:59.703
Yeah.

01:59.703 --> 02:03.790
What I can say is that there's a lot of
really smart, very careful people

02:03.790 --> 02:06.627
working as hard as they can
to make this as safe as it can be.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.670
Are you exploring far away?

02:09.670 --> 02:12.633
That's hard to explain, Hiro...

02:15.511 --> 02:16.762
but I'll be back really soon.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.013
In fact...

02:21.433 --> 02:25.229
my lucky pocketknife.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.941
I know we said we were gonna look into
getting you one when you were older,

02:28.941 --> 02:31.401
so I'm not actually giving this to you, okay?

02:32.444 --> 02:33.987
But I want you--

02:36.198 --> 02:38.992
I want you to keep it safe for me, okay?
Just until I'm back.

03:09.940 --> 03:10.941
How'd that go?

03:10.941 --> 03:13.652
He's fine. He's a tough little kid.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.362
- Operation Hourglass commencing.
- Yeah.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.573
- Personnel, standby.
- Takes after his mother.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.033
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.828
You did good, swab.

03:24.121 --> 03:28.458
She'd be proud.
It's a shame she can't be here to see it.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.377
She'd miss all this.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.922
- Running around, doing nine jobs at once.
- Yeah.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.801
And doing all of them better than
any nine of us could do one.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.848
That woman. She'd be late
accepting her own Nobel Prize.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.600
<i>All stations, system check.</i>

03:45.309 --> 03:47.269
Well, we just have to make sure
that you aren't.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.604
Good morning, sir.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.357
Yeah.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.618
You don't have to do this.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.829
There's plenty of qualified candidates
we can--

04:05.829 --> 04:10.000
No, no. No, I'm not gonna ask anybody
to do something that I wouldn't do myself.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.880
Well, it could be me.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.218
Hey, did you ever manage
to get that Jeep out of third?

04:20.344 --> 04:21.512
Go to hell.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.350
Don't mind if I do.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.023
<i>All stations, commence rewind checks.</i>

04:43.700 --> 04:45.536
President is right, gentlemen.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.746
Space is hard.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.292
The moon's a decade away.
Two, if we do it right.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.296
<i>Operation Hourglass is the culmination</i>

04:56.296 --> 04:59.550
<i>of nearly two decades
of Project Monarch's work.</i>

05:00.634 --> 05:04.555
Human discovery and
reconnaissance of the territory

05:04.555 --> 05:06.598
between us and them.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.517
Watch your heads, gentlemen.

05:12.271 --> 05:16.066
<i>A place that will redefine
our understanding of the entire planet</i>

05:16.066 --> 05:20.904
<i>and ensure the health and welfare
of all humanity.</i>

05:23.991 --> 05:28.161
And if we don't get there first, Senator,
Comrade Khrushchev will.

05:28.912 --> 05:29.955
<i>Na zdorovye.</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:39.506
What you're about to see

05:39.506 --> 05:42.885
is more than just a victory
for American scientific know-how

05:42.885 --> 05:44.094
or our defense.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.306
This mission is a matter of
global security

05:47.306 --> 05:49.975
and the preservation of mankind, gentlemen.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.144
Please, take a seat.

06:15.501 --> 06:19.838
Well, Kennedy can have outer space
and all the big rocks floating in it.

06:21.006 --> 06:25.594
We're about to plant our flag
in under space.

06:26.512 --> 06:29.598
<i>Hourglass is a go. Securing.</i>

06:31.475 --> 06:36.230
Our operating theory, gentlemen,
is that Titans get around underground

06:36.230 --> 06:39.274
in a kind of a king-sized rabbit warren.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.068
<i>Gamma simulator activated.</i>

06:41.068 --> 06:42.152
<i>Clear the space.</i>

06:42.152 --> 06:45.322
And Dr. Suzuki found a way in,
right here in the heartland.

06:45.822 --> 06:50.202
Now, the thing is, the tunnel is
too unstable for us to enter.

06:51.078 --> 06:55.832
The only thing which makes it passable
is a Titan.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.293
Doctor, we have positive response.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.756
All stations, Titan lock.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.634
<i>Repeat, we have Titan lock.</i>

07:05.634 --> 07:07.886
As we did on Bikini Atoll,

07:07.886 --> 07:10.097
we lure the Titan
with the promise of a meal.

07:10.097 --> 07:15.269
Titan's coming for our bait.
But, Jesus, that's a big one.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.479
5,000 feet to proximity. On my mark.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.356
And that promise will be unfulfilled.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.399
Mark.

07:20.399 --> 07:23.151
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

07:23.151 --> 07:24.486
<i>Titan at 4,000 feet.</i>

07:24.486 --> 07:26.363
But the tunnel between here and there

07:26.363 --> 07:28.574
stabilizes as they move through it.

07:28.574 --> 07:29.658
<i>3,000 feet.</i>

07:29.658 --> 07:31.535
<i>Terminate gamma simulator.</i>

07:32.035 --> 07:34.496
So, rather than unleash hell
in Kansas, we cut bait.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.039
There it goes. It's going home.

07:36.039 --> 07:40.586
And we sneak in behind them,
drafting down in their wake.

07:40.586 --> 07:41.837
<i>...one.</i>

07:55.142 --> 07:56.310
There they go.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.315
Come on, come on, come on.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.934
<i>What the hell is going on up there?
Billy, do you copy?</i>

08:44.816 --> 08:46.652
<i>Evacuate the staging ground.</i>

08:46.652 --> 08:48.695
<i>I'll say it again, evacuate the staging--</i>

08:48.695 --> 08:52.366
<i>Damn it, Billy, can you hear us?
Billy. Goddamn it. Billy, can you--</i>

08:52.366 --> 08:54.409
<i>I repeat, evacuate the staging ground.</i>

09:13.512 --> 09:16.431
<i>Mayday, mayday. Billy, do you--</i>

09:16.431 --> 09:18.809
<i>Mayday, mayday
the hourglass is imploding on us.</i>

09:45.836 --> 09:46.837
What happened?

09:48.964 --> 09:50.048
What the hell happened?

09:51.383 --> 09:52.384
I don't know.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.263
Where am I?

12:01.805 --> 12:04.892
Tokyo. We had to airlift you
out of Kazakhstan.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.268
What happened?

12:09.021 --> 12:11.440
Everything at the reactor plant...

12:14.401 --> 12:15.819
it went terribly wrong.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.363
- What does that mean?
- Shaw.

12:18.363 --> 12:19.656
He imploded the rifts

12:19.656 --> 12:22.576
and the whole thing
collapsed down on itself.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.388
<i>Then the locals showed up.</i>

12:44.223 --> 12:46.808
<i>I'm lucky I didn't end up
in a Kazakh prison.</i>

12:46.808 --> 12:49.353
<i>A lot of good people didn't make it out.</i>

12:52.064 --> 12:53.065
Shaw...

12:54.858 --> 12:55.859
May.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.570
Cate?

13:02.157 --> 13:03.158
I'm sorry.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.291
Okay.
So where do we start looking for them?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.376
Kentaro...

13:14.419 --> 13:16.171
they didn't make it.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.553
- We finish Shaw's work--
- Lee Shaw died doing what he loved,

13:23.720 --> 13:26.682
pouring gasoline
on fires he doesn't understand.

13:27.224 --> 13:31.270
He augmented a moment of global crisis
for this organization

13:32.104 --> 13:34.565
that we have barely begun dealing with,

13:34.565 --> 13:37.442
and he got your sister
and friend killed doing it.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.695
I'm sorry, Kentaro.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.488
Thank you for your help,

13:42.906 --> 13:45.158
but your time in our world
has come to an end.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.460
Wait, wait. No, they ca--

13:55.460 --> 13:58.505
We can-- They're my family.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.801
There has to be something I can do,
something we can do.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.012
There is.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.390
Live.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.748
I'm okay.

15:10.536 --> 15:11.954
Cate?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.584
Cate!

15:22.381 --> 15:23.382
Cate!

15:32.850 --> 15:33.892
Cate!

15:42.734 --> 15:44.027
Cate!

15:49.616 --> 15:51.118
Cate!

16:07.593 --> 16:09.178
- May! All right, all right. Come on.
- Shaw...

16:09.178 --> 16:10.304
- We can't stay here.
- Shaw.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.389
We gotta get out of this place.
We gotta move fast.

16:12.389 --> 16:15.684
You gotta hold my hand
and move exactly where I move, okay?

16:15.684 --> 16:17.269
- Okay.
- Now. Come on. Come on.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.062
We gotta avoid the lights.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.772
No. This way, this way. Come on.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.524
Come on. Keep moving!

16:27.237 --> 16:29.740
- Shaw. Shaw.
- This way.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.575
Come on, come on.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.661
This way.

16:43.295 --> 16:44.838
What the hell?

16:44.838 --> 16:46.298
- We're all right.
- What is going on?

16:46.298 --> 16:48.175
We're all right.
We made it across the field.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.847
After a rift closes, it leaves some kind
of electrical charge or something.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.391
It affects your vision.
It affects the ground.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.852
It goes off like a lethal static shock.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.897
- How do you know that?
- Because I've been down here, May.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.858
On a recon mission.
Same thing happened to my eyes.

17:06.652 --> 17:07.903
Recon mission?

17:09.655 --> 17:10.656
Where are we?

17:12.449 --> 17:13.951
We're in it, May.

17:15.743 --> 17:21.124
We're in their world. The Titans'.
This is just another part of their realm.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.919
How did I get here?

17:23.919 --> 17:27.047
I cleared the space,
and then I hit the timer.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.049
She must have turned around
and come back inside.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.134
Oh, my God. She followed me back.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.053
- No, no. Listen to me.
- Oh, my God, no.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.805
- No. She started to fall.
- No, I gotta find her.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.891
I caught her. Hey, we fell together.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.562
May, she's down here somewhere.
I know that.

17:41.562 --> 17:42.980
Is she alive?

17:44.231 --> 17:46.692
- Did you see her when she--
- We're gonna find her, May.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.114
But you gotta do everything
exactly as I say,

17:53.407 --> 17:55.659
and I can keep you safe.
Do you understand?

17:58.871 --> 18:00.956
- Yeah, I just wanna find Cate.
- We will.

18:02.708 --> 18:03.709
We will. Come on.

18:17.848 --> 18:18.849
Cate!

18:20.267 --> 18:21.268
Cate!

18:22.227 --> 18:23.228
Cate!

18:24.438 --> 18:25.772
Cate!

18:59.014 --> 19:01.517
<i>Dr. Randa? General Puckett is here.</i>

19:03.101 --> 19:06.230
"As a result of
the catastrophic loss of life

19:06.230 --> 19:08.857
in the undertaking of Operation Hourglass

19:08.857 --> 19:14.446
and the inability of Project Monarch
to ascertain the cause of the catastrophe,

19:14.446 --> 19:16.406
the Department of Defense has ordered

19:16.406 --> 19:20.577
no further funds be allocated
to Project Monarch going forward."

19:24.373 --> 19:26.333
There's more, but you get the point.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.337
It's over, Bill.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.173
I'm sorry.

19:36.134 --> 19:40.305
How are we supposed to
ascertain the cause of the catastrophe

19:40.305 --> 19:43.600
- if they're shutting us down?
- Our DOD isn't big on theories

19:43.600 --> 19:45.519
when proving them costs lives.

19:45.519 --> 19:48.772
They really think NASA's getting to space
without losing some people?

19:48.772 --> 19:50.482
Space they understand.

19:51.525 --> 19:57.739
A network of portals connecting to
a hidden realm of monsters? It sounds...

19:57.739 --> 19:59.908
- Insane.
- In a word.

19:59.908 --> 20:03.203
And without an imminent threat
like our friend on Bikini Atoll...

20:03.203 --> 20:06.498
Well, we could just bring one up, right?

20:06.498 --> 20:08.709
Show 'em what a real catastrophe
looks like.

20:08.709 --> 20:09.877
And what then?

20:11.461 --> 20:15.883
Hope it's smaller than Godzilla
and listens to reason?

20:19.136 --> 20:23.891
- I could've stopped it.
- I could've stopped it.

20:23.891 --> 20:28.937
"Older men declare war,
but it is youth that must fight and die."

20:30.147 --> 20:33.442
I assure you, it's harder
when you know the youth in question.

20:34.985 --> 20:37.029
He was my friend, too.

20:39.656 --> 20:40.908
I can't let it go, Puck.

20:44.328 --> 20:45.329
I won't.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.168
Now, your boy's already lost a mother.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.421
Now an uncle.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.843
Do not take his father away too.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.733
- We're never gonna find her.
- Come on, May.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.944
- Cate!
- Time isn't on our side.

21:16.944 --> 21:20.322
The longer we're down here,
the longer we're down here.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.406
What do you mean?

21:21.406 --> 21:26.453
Well, I'm not a science guy,
so it's a little difficult to explain.

21:26.954 --> 21:29.414
- Well, I got time.
- Actually, you don't.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.794
- What are you talking about?
- I told you.

21:33.794 --> 21:37.464
I've been here before and I made it back.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.287
Do you know what your name is?

22:08.287 --> 22:09.913
Leland.

22:09.913 --> 22:14.918
Leland Lafayette Shaw III.

22:17.504 --> 22:20.257
- What is your rank and serial number?
- Do you know where you are?

22:20.257 --> 22:22.509
- What happened? What is Project Monarch?
- How did you get here?

22:22.509 --> 22:24.970
- What is Operation Hourglass?
- Do you know where you are?

22:24.970 --> 22:28.307
- What monster were you hunting?
- Get me Bill Randa.

22:40.152 --> 22:42.154
Shaw's been here a week

22:42.154 --> 22:43.947
and he's still refusing to eat.

22:44.698 --> 22:46.450
It will become a problem soon.

22:59.671 --> 23:02.216
You are wasting away. You must eat.

23:03.467 --> 23:07.387
I'd like to have Bill Randa
bring me a sandwich.

23:14.895 --> 23:15.896
Thank you.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.565
Though it wouldn't be
much of a hunger strike

23:18.565 --> 23:20.609
if I made any exceptions, would it?

23:23.570 --> 23:24.988
You are very kind.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.287
I am sorry.

23:32.621 --> 23:33.455
Whatever for?

23:36.834 --> 23:42.881
Bill Randa! Get me Bill Randa!

23:43.257 --> 23:45.843
- What's going on?
- Get me Bill Randa! Get me...

23:50.138 --> 23:51.306
Randa.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.976
William J. Randa!

23:53.976 --> 23:55.394
Get me Bill Randa!

23:55.394 --> 23:57.437
- Answer me, damn it.
- Security!

23:57.437 --> 23:58.939
- Somebody answer me.
- Security!

23:58.939 --> 24:01.483
Anyone understand English?

24:01.483 --> 24:03.735
- Shaw!
- Get me Bill Randa!

24:03.735 --> 24:06.613
- Let her go.
- Go get me Bill Randa.

24:07.823 --> 24:09.950
I can't. He's dead.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.620
We are in a Monarch medical facility.

24:13.620 --> 24:18.292
You disappeared during Operation Hourglass
in 1962...

24:20.294 --> 24:21.795
twenty years ago.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.551
Uncle Lee.

24:51.825 --> 24:52.951
Welcome home.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.496
No.

24:57.873 --> 25:00.250
No, no.

25:00.876 --> 25:02.878
No.

25:22.731 --> 25:23.857
Ms. Matsumoto...

25:24.900 --> 25:25.901
Dr. Randa.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.614
I came to offer my apologies for today.

25:33.242 --> 25:35.953
It looks worse than it is.

25:37.371 --> 25:39.623
In some ways, Shaw is my responsibility.

25:40.123 --> 25:43.877
I have no excuse for allowing
such a thing to happen to you.

25:47.464 --> 25:48.715
Shaw was

25:49.800 --> 25:50.926
terrified,

25:52.052 --> 25:53.136
alone,

25:53.762 --> 25:55.180
and in a lot of pain.

25:57.224 --> 26:01.103
Lonely, scared people in pain

26:02.437 --> 26:05.107
can do terrible things.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.490
Thank you.

26:15.868 --> 26:17.327
Are you going to talk to him?

26:18.203 --> 26:20.664
He's my responsibility. I think I have to.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.710
But you don't want to talk to him.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.212
Why?

26:27.796 --> 26:29.548
When I was a boy,

26:29.756 --> 26:32.259
he and my father and my mother promised me

26:32.593 --> 26:34.428
that they'd come back.

26:34.803 --> 26:37.306
I waited and waited,
but they didn't return.

26:37.723 --> 26:40.934
I mourned them and moved on.

26:44.354 --> 26:45.689
Dr. Randa...

26:47.149 --> 26:50.861
it would seem like Shaw
has kept his promise.

27:05.751 --> 27:07.169
Go slow.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.671
Be careful.

27:09.671 --> 27:10.964
I'm fine.

27:13.592 --> 27:14.885
Good, good, good...

27:16.053 --> 27:17.262
Sit down.

27:20.724 --> 27:22.059
I'm fine!

27:22.059 --> 27:24.811
Let me move the table. Just a moment.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.189
- Elevate your leg--
- Mom!

27:34.530 --> 27:36.865
When you're able to move better

27:37.032 --> 27:38.408
maybe you can call the office--

27:38.408 --> 27:40.911
I don't want my old job back.

27:42.079 --> 27:43.080
Kentaro--

27:43.664 --> 27:44.748
Don't.

27:47.042 --> 27:48.502
If it wasn't the right job,

27:48.502 --> 27:49.503
you can find another--

27:49.503 --> 27:51.421
I don't want to talk about work.

27:51.421 --> 27:52.881
What do you want to do?

27:58.554 --> 28:00.472
I should be with Cate.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.809
Why would you say such a horrible thing?

28:04.184 --> 28:05.644
I wanted to stop them.

28:06.436 --> 28:07.855
I should have saved them.

28:10.399 --> 28:12.150
I should have been with them.

28:12.901 --> 28:14.528
I should have done whatever I could.

28:15.487 --> 28:18.824
How can they expect me to go back
to the way things were?

28:20.909 --> 28:24.830
No one expects that, Kentaro.

28:28.375 --> 28:31.044
After that much loss...

28:31.545 --> 28:35.799
...such grief and pain and despair...

28:36.842 --> 28:40.304
...going back is not possible.

28:43.473 --> 28:45.100
I'm sorry.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.644
It's not your fault, Mom.

28:51.148 --> 28:52.482
I meant...

28:53.483 --> 28:56.195
...I'm sorry that you have to
feel this at all.

28:57.154 --> 28:58.822
But Kentaro...

29:01.450 --> 29:04.912
You must let yourself feel it.

29:08.457 --> 29:10.292
I don't know what to do.

29:14.338 --> 29:15.756
Yes, you do.

29:17.758 --> 29:18.842
But that woman said--

29:18.842 --> 29:21.637
When have you ever done
what you've been told?

29:27.226 --> 29:28.185
Yeah, you're right.

30:06.682 --> 30:09.768
It's a signal!

30:09.768 --> 30:11.103
What is a signal?

30:11.103 --> 30:14.189
The gamma burst. The first-- Okay.

30:14.898 --> 30:16.817
Every time Shaw's
imploded another rift point,

30:16.817 --> 30:18.986
we get more gamma rays all over the world, right?

30:18.986 --> 30:21.530
Yeah. Big, noisy, chaotic,
and they're getting stronger--

30:21.530 --> 30:24.658
Barnes, all 12 of them
seem like they're ready to erupt.

30:24.658 --> 30:28.203
Yes, right, but not the first one.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.163
That signal remained constant.

30:30.163 --> 30:34.585
So I crushed it down
so that I could see all of it, and look.

30:35.377 --> 30:37.212
When you zoom out, there's a pattern.

30:38.839 --> 30:40.966
Where is it coming from?

30:41.925 --> 30:43.218
It's a message.

30:43.218 --> 30:45.137
Somebody's sending us a message.

31:12.164 --> 31:13.373
Is she okay?

31:15.042 --> 31:16.335
She will be.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.128
Good.

31:18.837 --> 31:20.506
They sent you in here to talk to me, huh?

31:21.173 --> 31:22.799
Think I'll open up to you?

31:22.799 --> 31:25.469
Yes. You don't have to, of course.

31:25.469 --> 31:29.097
Why is Monarch treating me
like I'm a prisoner?

31:29.097 --> 31:32.434
No one's entirely sure if you are safe.

31:33.435 --> 31:34.520
Safe?

31:34.520 --> 31:36.939
Not contagious or radioactive...

31:36.939 --> 31:38.273
Or a Russian plant.

31:43.862 --> 31:46.406
- But you don't believe that.
- Of course not.

31:47.699 --> 31:48.700
You're my Uncle Lee.

31:50.494 --> 31:53.163
They just wanna know what happened to you,
and how.

31:53.747 --> 31:58.085
Your survival, your age, defies logic.

31:58.085 --> 31:59.586
And beyond logic...

32:01.505 --> 32:02.673
Lies truth.

32:03.715 --> 32:05.676
Some things never change, huh?

32:06.385 --> 32:08.136
Not even at Monarch.

32:11.181 --> 32:14.059
If I tell you the truth,
you're just gonna think I'm crazy.

32:14.059 --> 32:17.312
If you keep it to yourself,
it was all for nothing.

32:38.292 --> 32:41.003
We experienced an uncontrolled flight
into terrain.

32:57.936 --> 33:02.274
<i>Ben was down on arrival.</i>

33:04.776 --> 33:06.653
So we began planned EVA.

33:09.031 --> 33:10.949
<i>While attempting to contact
mission control,</i>

33:10.949 --> 33:13.410
<i>we began our recon of the landing site.</i>

33:17.706 --> 33:18.707
And then...

33:22.085 --> 33:23.962
something happened.

33:28.175 --> 33:31.637
<i>We encountered
a massive unknown terrestrial organism.</i>

33:31.637 --> 33:33.764
I called for immediate evacuation.

33:38.477 --> 33:40.604
<i>Local phenomena made our egress...</i>

33:43.148 --> 33:44.024
difficult.

33:51.031 --> 33:55.619
And then... the next thing I remember...

34:07.756 --> 34:08.757
I was here.

34:09.257 --> 34:13.387
They found you in the woods
outside of Higashiizumo.

34:13.387 --> 34:15.347
Inside it, there's a shrine.

34:15.347 --> 34:18.976
They said it's the boundary between
the worlds of the living and the dead.

34:18.976 --> 34:20.936
We found a rift in there.

34:20.936 --> 34:22.228
"Mythography."

34:26.567 --> 34:27.734
Your dad would've liked that.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.612
He was right, Hiro.

34:31.405 --> 34:32.864
Bill Randa was right.

34:34.283 --> 34:36.243
What exactly was my father right about?

34:36.243 --> 34:37.452
About everything.

34:37.452 --> 34:39.830
Their world and ours.

34:39.830 --> 34:40.956
Their balance.

34:40.956 --> 34:43.500
I think you are confused.

34:45.168 --> 34:46.460
My father was crazy.

34:47.295 --> 34:50.174
After he lost my mother and then you...

34:53.677 --> 34:54.678
he lost himself.

34:55.846 --> 35:01.226
Monarch is moving you to a secure facility
for observation and study.

35:01.977 --> 35:02.978
Study?

35:02.978 --> 35:05.647
It looks and feels like a retirement home.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.066
I think you'll be comfortable there.

35:08.066 --> 35:11.570
No, wait. You can't-- Wait, Hiro. Stop.

35:12.237 --> 35:13.947
We can do this together.

35:14.615 --> 35:15.616
We can figure it out.

35:16.700 --> 35:17.951
You and me.

35:18.660 --> 35:21.872
- We can do it.
-"We" are not doing anything.

35:23.373 --> 35:25.375
300,000 years--

35:25.375 --> 35:28.545
From the cradle of a civilization
to the moon--

35:28.545 --> 35:32.508
We lived with the Titans until you three.

35:34.510 --> 35:37.262
Some beasts
are best left undisturbed. I'm sorry.

35:41.892 --> 35:43.268
This is your legacy.

35:45.062 --> 35:47.523
This is your family business.

35:49.650 --> 35:55.072
I buried that family
in three empty boxes a long time ago.

35:55.072 --> 35:57.741
The madness that devoured my childhood--

35:59.576 --> 36:01.995
Wasn't madness.

36:03.705 --> 36:05.457
Then it was a choice.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.418
Maybe that makes it worse.

36:24.351 --> 36:27.646
<i>The pregnant macaque
has another reason to visit the onsen:</i>

36:27.646 --> 36:28.772
<i>pain relief.</i>

36:29.356 --> 36:31.608
<i>A long soak in the natural hot spring</i>

36:31.608 --> 36:34.027
<i>is exactly what
this soon-to-be mother needs</i>

36:34.027 --> 36:36.613
<i>after a long day in the Japanese Alps.</i>

36:39.783 --> 36:42.286
<i>Gestation will last
about five and a half months,</i>

36:42.286 --> 36:44.830
<i>with the majority occurring
during the wintertime.</i>

36:45.956 --> 36:48.834
<i>The beetle's adventure now begins,</i>

36:48.834 --> 36:55.716
<i>as it searches for sources of pollen,
nectar, or its favorite, the rose.</i>

36:56.675 --> 36:58.302
<i>With distinct marking--</i>

36:58.302 --> 37:01.013
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.</i>

37:27.039 --> 37:28.040
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

37:28.040 --> 37:30.876
Yeah. Well, now you know.

37:32.628 --> 37:34.796
You lost a lot of years of your life.

37:35.797 --> 37:39.968
I don't know. I don't think
I lost years, May.

37:40.969 --> 37:45.557
I mean, if we find some way
to get you home...

37:46.975 --> 37:49.561
and what happened to me
doesn't happen to you,

37:51.230 --> 37:52.856
well, then I'd say it was worth it.

37:56.151 --> 37:59.404
Don't let this get to your head,
but you look good for 90-whatever.

37:59.404 --> 38:00.989
That's what everybody tells me.

38:01.949 --> 38:03.075
Cate!

38:03.075 --> 38:04.576
Where is she?

38:04.576 --> 38:06.328
Cate!

38:09.373 --> 38:12.459
- Cate!
- Cate!

38:13.961 --> 38:15.462
Cate!

38:30.686 --> 38:31.770
Kentaro.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.399
Well, look who it is.

38:37.359 --> 38:38.360
Back from the dead again?

38:40.571 --> 38:41.572
How are you?

38:41.572 --> 38:43.574
I just came back to Tokyo.

38:44.408 --> 38:46.076
I haven't had time
to reach out to your mother--

38:46.076 --> 38:50.622
More important things to do than to check
that we made it out of the desert alive?

38:50.956 --> 38:51.999
We understand.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.168
What are you doing here?

38:55.085 --> 38:56.545
I was just leaving.

38:57.045 --> 38:57.880
You?

38:57.880 --> 38:59.715
Trying to continue my work.

38:59.965 --> 39:01.341
Something went wrong in the desert,

39:01.967 --> 39:04.261
and I need to know why.

39:05.053 --> 39:08.265
Which will be considerably more difficult
if you avail yourself of my files.

39:08.265 --> 39:10.017
How did you even get in here?

39:11.435 --> 39:12.936
I got the keys from Cate.

39:13.353 --> 39:15.981
What were you two doing
out there in the desert?

39:16.815 --> 39:17.983
How did you find out I was there--

39:17.983 --> 39:19.818
We were looking for you, Dad.

39:20.819 --> 39:22.321
We thought you were dead.

39:26.783 --> 39:28.660
I suppose I have a lot to explain
to you both.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.245
How would you even start?

39:31.121 --> 39:31.955
Kentaro...

39:32.623 --> 39:34.541
...you were never meant
to know about her.

39:34.541 --> 39:35.834
About that part of my life.

39:35.834 --> 39:36.960
Too late.

39:39.213 --> 39:41.590
What do you hope to accomplish with those?

39:41.590 --> 39:42.966
I want my own answers.

39:43.467 --> 39:45.302
And Monarch won't help anymore,

39:45.302 --> 39:47.012
so I have to figure it out on my own.

39:47.304 --> 39:49.056
It's no wonder you're angry.

39:49.515 --> 39:51.642
I know I've hurt you both.

39:51.642 --> 39:52.559
But...

39:52.559 --> 39:54.186
...what you're looking for
is not in there.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.313
If I could just talk to you
and your sister, I could--

39:56.313 --> 39:57.481
I said it's too late for that!

39:57.481 --> 39:58.941
What is too late?!

40:07.574 --> 40:09.368
Cate died, Dad.

40:22.548 --> 40:24.508
That can't be true.

40:26.927 --> 40:28.887
You're saying that to hurt me.

40:29.972 --> 40:32.432
I hurt you, you're trying to hurt me back.

40:32.850 --> 40:34.685
Please tell me it's not--

40:39.773 --> 40:41.191
Please tell me it's not--

40:47.364 --> 40:48.740
Oh, God!

40:50.367 --> 40:51.743
What have I done?

40:56.248 --> 40:57.165
If you weren't

40:57.165 --> 40:58.792
a sad, lying, secret little man

40:58.792 --> 41:01.086
who kept running away from her,

41:01.336 --> 41:03.839
Cate never would've
come barging into my life!

41:05.966 --> 41:07.217
This is your fault!
