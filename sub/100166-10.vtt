Yeah, it makes everyone
feel so good and cozy.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.904
I'm not ready for it to be done.
I want to binge more.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.532
What are you guys talking about?

01:14.949 --> 01:15.825
[all three] Ice cream.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.538
What else would we be talking about?

01:20.622 --> 01:21.581
Um, I don't know,

01:21.664 --> 01:23.792
maybe that triple wedding
you guys need to plan.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.754
Wait, so that wasn't a dream?

01:27.837 --> 01:30.215
We're all really getting married together?

01:30.673 --> 01:31.508
[Stephanie, DJ] Yup.

01:33.301 --> 01:36.221
And we all did a synchronized
proposal dance in the street?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.224
Sure did.

"Hangin' Tough" to me

the news of your wedding pretty well.

Oh, you mean the news that her parents,
who were already together,

02:07.252 --> 02:09.712
are getting married a second time?
Yeah, she's a real hero.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.133
How are the boys doing?

02:13.216 --> 02:15.677
Have you talked to them about
Steve moving in after the wedding?

02:16.302 --> 02:18.096
Oh, well, I did a while ago, but...

02:18.513 --> 02:21.391
now that it's becoming real,
I should check in with them again.

The boys love Steve.
He's been in their lives forever.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.896
Well, I know,
but it's one thing  dating someone

02:26.980 --> 02:28.523
and a whole other thing marrying them.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.818
Steve moving in will be a big adjustment,

02:32.026 --> 02:34.696
especially for Max.
He does not do well with change.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.700
Yeah, remember when they recast
Jennifer Esposito on Blue Bloods?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.204
He boycotted CBS for a whole year.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.791
Well, I just want everything to go well.

Well, so what's with all the gifts?
Trying to buy their affection?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.323
Yeah, I'm not an idiot.

03:19.657 --> 03:22.035
I got Nintendo games for Jackson,

03:22.243 --> 03:24.787
the Sherlock Holmes collection for Max,

03:24.871 --> 03:27.123
and some shiny keys for Tommy.

03:27.957 --> 03:31.461
And if none of that works,
I have some cash and an Arby's gift card.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.007
Well, hey, Steve, aren't you a little
worried that I might not embrace you?

03:36.090 --> 03:37.884
Because I could use
some walking around money.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.346

that Arby's gift card.

nothing is going to change.

for breakfast?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.114
Okay, that'll change.

for breakfast?

that don't concern breakfast?

to Disneyland out of this.

to bring this up again.

that they did not care for me.

They've never met Ramona. [gasps]

And what's really going to blow
their minds?

07:34.036 --> 07:35.997
They've never seen me
with straightened hair!

07:41.252 --> 07:44.213
Wait, you lived next door to us
your entire childhood

07:44.297 --> 07:45.798
and you never met my parents?

07:46.382 --> 07:49.260
I met Kimmy, I wasn't about to go
searching for what created her.

07:52.930 --> 07:57.977
I can't believe your parents hate me.
I'm like the Raymond, everybody loves me.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.273
I'm sorry I ever told you

08:02.356 --> 08:05.651
that my parents didn't have
the ideal first impression of you.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.361

I turned out to be!

are a little weird.

in his room when he's not here.

Joey, this my room.
It has been for five years.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.120
Well, if Danny was just giving out rooms,

08:58.204 --> 09:00.581
why did I always
have to sleep in the alcove? [chuckles]

09:02.166 --> 09:03.584
So, what are you doing?

09:04.126 --> 09:05.836
I'm just making room in my closet.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.005
I don't think I'm going
to wear this anymore.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.634
Whoa, even I think that's outdated,
and I'm Joey.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.225
Oh, wow.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.186
Is that Tommy's?

09:24.647 --> 09:27.191
Yeah, it was his special occasion suit.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.111
I didn't even know I still had this.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.407
You okay?

09:37.952 --> 09:40.079
Yeah, it just caught me off-guard.

Man, he didn't like getting dressed up,
did he?

when he did.

head back to my hotel, but...

09:55.720 --> 09:57.597
I can stick around if you need me to.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.058
No, it's okay.

10:01.892 --> 10:02.727
You sure?

10:03.561 --> 10:04.812
Yeah, thanks.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.190
Tommy always wanted me
to be happy and...

10:09.525 --> 10:11.027
Steve makes me really happy.

-No, Mom, I get it.

Max might react badly, but I...

11:03.037 --> 11:04.997
I didn't see it coming from Jackson.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.917
-I should go talk to him.
-You know, maybe...

11:08.000 --> 11:10.252
maybe give him a little time
to process this.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.756
Yeah, maybe you're right.

11:16.550 --> 11:17.677
You know, on second thought,

11:17.760 --> 11:20.179
it's Ginger's birthday in a few weeks
and...

11:21.931 --> 11:22.807
Man.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.477
She's going to love this.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.943
So we're having a rehearsal dinner
for the dinner,

11:34.026 --> 11:37.196
which is not a rehearsal dinner,
with the parents who are not the parents.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.073
This is an odd situation, no?

It's them. Talk me up.
I want them to like me, okay?

11:51.127 --> 11:54.004
Why, so they can zero in on me?
No, no, no, you're on your own, buddy.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.925
[in exaggerated accent] Oh, hello!

12:05.433 --> 12:07.560

12:08.018 --> 12:10.730
And, boy, are our airplane arms tired.

12:10.813 --> 12:11.939

12:46.432 --> 12:48.225
I didn't notice you there.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.937
You've straightened your hair! Oh!

12:54.190 --> 12:55.816
How lovely!

12:57.568 --> 12:59.111
Mommy called me lovely!

13:01.697 --> 13:02.656
Okay, so I was wrong.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.533
This is not a Wednesday, this is weird.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.662
It's true.
They are pretty eccentric.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.165
Stop muttering, boy!

13:12.166 --> 13:15.586
If you have something to say,
come out and say it to all of us.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.923
Yes, Father, if you mutter,
you don't matter.

13:19.507 --> 13:23.177
Bully! Bully for you, Jeffcoat,
chip off the old block.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.681
Well, I'm actually enjoying the show.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.600
They seem to have forgotten
they don't like me.

13:31.852 --> 13:35.731
Hello, Kimmy's philandering
race car driver.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.901
Oh, no, they do remember.

13:40.694 --> 13:41.821
Hey, have you seen my--

13:41.904 --> 13:42.738
[gasps]

13:43.739 --> 13:47.076
Is this my beautiful grandbaby?

13:47.493 --> 13:48.494
Oh!

13:50.788 --> 13:53.999
Come give Nana an Eskimo kiss.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.627
Mmm!

13:57.253 --> 13:59.255
Yeah, whatever this is,
I'm not doing it.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.509
Fifteen months till college,
15 months till college.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.721
Fifteen months?
That is just around the corner.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.014
I'm gonna go help her pack.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.685
How lovely to finally meet

14:12.768 --> 14:14.728
one of the weirdo Tanners.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.022
Uh...

14:17.147 --> 14:18.941
wait, we were the weirdos?

14:21.151 --> 14:23.779
A family with three dads?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.907
Kids driving cars through the kitchen?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.077
Terrorizing our pet ostrich?

14:31.370 --> 14:35.082
Some guy constantly singing
the song "Forever"?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.962
That's pretty weird
from where I was sitting,

14:40.045 --> 14:42.172
which was on the Velcro wall.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.802
So, who's excited to meet Mom and Dad?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.394
I can't believe I'm going to see
my parents.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.147
Although somehow
it feels like I just saw them.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.359
Honestly, I'm not sure what I just saw,

15:02.443 --> 15:04.778
but it's a conversation for me
and my pastor.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.740
That's what I call my bartender.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.869
Wow, you look great.

15:11.952 --> 15:12.912
Thank you.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.079
Hey, where's Jackson?

15:14.580 --> 15:15.998
Oh, I don't think he's coming.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.292
He said he's not feeling well.

15:18.792 --> 15:22.087
I've been trying to talk to him,
but he's been avoiding me since yesterday.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.966
Even tried to put a pancake
in front of his door. He didn't touch it.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.595
Wait, so it's just still there?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.180
Asking for a friend.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.018
Why don't you guys go to the party
without me?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.853
I'm gonna stay and try to talk to Jackson.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.938
Aww.

15:39.021 --> 15:39.980
Thank you, honey.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.441
Maybe you can make some more headway
with him than I did.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.361
Let's go.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.950
You're just hanging back to avoid
seeing the Gibblers, aren't you?

15:53.118 --> 15:55.412
A man can have more than one motivation.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.126
[knocking at door]

16:02.127 --> 16:04.505
Mom, I told you I'm sick. I'm not coming.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.883
Sorry, it's not your mom, it's me.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.343
Can I come in?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.304
[sighs] Sure.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.224
I don't want you to catch what I have.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.934
[exaggerated coughing]

16:19.186 --> 16:20.562
I'll take my chances.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.150
Look, Jackson, I know that things have
got to be a little...

16:25.234 --> 16:28.320
strange lately, with your mom
getting married again.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.698
I just want you to know that...

16:32.074 --> 16:35.285
I love your mom
and I love you boys, and, uh...

16:35.911 --> 16:39.331
I just hope that maybe someday you can,
you know, accept me into your family.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.293
I really like you, Steve. I do.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.338
It's just seeing that suit, you know.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.258
It's the suit my dad wore
to my fifth-grade graduation.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.971
Just made me realize
that he's not coming back.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.019
Look, Jackson,
I'm not here to replace your dad, okay?

17:00.102 --> 17:03.355
Your dad was a great guy who raised
really great kids.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.691
I'm just here to be Steve...

17:06.233 --> 17:07.443
a guy who loves your family.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.112
If you're feeling any better,

17:10.195 --> 17:12.656
there's a lot of people who would love
to see you at that party.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.575
And...

17:15.242 --> 17:16.702
I got you something...

17:17.995 --> 17:19.705
just in case you change your mind.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.790
Thanks, Steve.

17:22.291 --> 17:26.211
Listen, if anybody asks, this conversation
lasted at least another 20 minutes.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.674
I really don't want to meet
those Gibblers.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.731
Huh? Huh? Huh?

17:45.814 --> 17:47.649
[overlapping chatter, applause]

17:47.733 --> 17:48.567
Joey!

17:50.652 --> 17:52.029
So, uh, what do you think?

17:52.112 --> 17:53.572
Joey, this is amazing!

17:54.114 --> 17:57.242
Wearing this hat and blazer,
I feel like a Howell.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.496
[howls]

18:01.914 --> 18:04.458
Wrong howl. Not a she-wolf, a Thurston,

18:04.541 --> 18:08.378
but I love  the enthusiasm, Gibbler,
pip-pip!

18:10.380 --> 18:12.049
Well, it's a big night.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.134
Ramona, are you ready to meet
your grandparents?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.511
Yeah, I'm excited.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.887
Well, unless it's you in a wig.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.265
It's you in a wig, isn't it?

18:22.309 --> 18:24.603
Fifteen months till college,
15 months till college.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.192
Joey, thanks so much
for setting this whole night up,

18:30.818 --> 18:33.904
But mostly, thanks for reconnecting me
with my parents.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.115
Oh, it's my pleasure, Kimmy.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.492
You know, I haven't told anyone yet,

18:38.575 --> 18:40.369
but when I see my dad tonight...

18:40.911 --> 18:42.871
I'm going to ask him
to walk me down the aisle.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.706
He's a lucky feller.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.707
[chuckles]

18:47.876 --> 18:50.045
I still don't know what to do
about Jackson.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.588
It's going to be all right.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.298
Jackson's pretty resilient.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.842
It's me you should be worried about.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.011
-You?
-Yeah.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.348
I haven't even met Mrs. Gibbler yet,
and the woman is already exhausting.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.059
Hey, Deej.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.436
Oh, hey.
Did you talk to Jackson? Is he coming?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.480
I did what I could but I'm not sure.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.817
[playing fanfare on harmonica]

19:12.568 --> 19:15.445
I have a singing telegram

19:47.352 --> 19:48.645
This is kind of my fault.

19:48.729 --> 19:49.730
I'll go talk to her.

19:49.813 --> 19:50.647
Okay.

-Hey.

You all right?

19:55.819 --> 19:57.946
Yeah, I'm okay, but...

19:58.822 --> 20:01.742
Poor Kimmy. She always wants to believe
the best in people.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.703
Me, I thought something like this
might happen.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.789
Growing up,
we got a lot of singing telegrams.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.458
Oh.

Okay, sad coats. If you see Kimmy,
tell her Joey's looking for her.

20:46.703 --> 20:47.829
It's actually me.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.790
I'm the sad coat.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.542
Kimmy, I'm sorry.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.087
I feel like this is somewhat my fault.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.005
It's entirely your fault.

20:58.715 --> 21:01.343
I feel a little bit responsible.

Yeah, there's no one else that bears
any responsibility.

[exhales]

21:10.060 --> 21:12.813
It's my fault for letting myself
get excited again.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.275
I was just hoping this time,
things would be different.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.822
But as much as I've tried to deny it,
this is what they were always like.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.367
And this is why I spent so much time
at the Tanner house.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.786
You guys were my real family.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.247
I feel the same way.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.834
That's why I spent so much time
with Jesse and Danny.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.336
Kimmy, I don't like to talk
about it very much,

21:36.420 --> 21:39.089
but I didn't have
the greatest family life either.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.134
And that's why all you guys
became my family.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.177
Wow.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.764
It sounds like we have a lot more
in common than we realized.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.069
If my dad didn't come tonight,

22:01.153 --> 22:03.447
then he's probably not going to come
to my wedding either.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.616
Kimmy, he doesn't know what he's missing.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.748
You know something, it was
an absolute pleasure to watch you grow up.

22:13.665 --> 22:14.624
And, Kimmy...

22:15.584 --> 22:17.252
I would be very honored

22:17.336 --> 22:20.672
if you'd allow me to walk you down
the aisle on your wedding day.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.091
Really?

22:23.717 --> 22:25.344

-Thanks, Joey.
-Mm-hmm.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.311
Okay, we'd better get back
into that party.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.866
I'm actually really good.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.243
Joey talked me through it.

22:50.952 --> 22:51.828
This Joey?

22:54.456 --> 22:56.833
Did you call Grandpa Danny
and ask him what to say?

22:58.293 --> 22:59.419
For your information,

22:59.503 --> 23:01.880
I did pretty darn well on my own.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.091
-So did this kid.
-Aww.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.509
Thanks.

23:06.676 --> 23:09.346
Kimberlina, how dare your parents
not show up.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.432
They travel the world
searching for treasure,

23:12.849 --> 23:15.936
never realizing the most precious treasure
is you.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.438
Thank you, Fernando.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.023
I love you, too.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.319
And, Ramona, I'm sorry you didn't get
to meet your grandparents.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.279
Oh, it's okay.

If they're anything like your impression,
I'm good.

23:30.867 --> 23:31.701
Hey.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.372
I'm sorry our parents
let us down again, Sis.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.540
But...

23:37.457 --> 23:39.876
I think we've got a pretty great family
without them.

23:42.587 --> 23:43.588
We sure do.

23:44.923 --> 23:45.841
So...

23:46.466 --> 23:47.884
I say we play them at the wedding.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.847
But this time, I'll be Dad.
I never get to wear the monocle.

23:53.557 --> 23:54.641
[Kimmy] Ah!

24:10.073 --> 24:10.991
Wow.

24:14.995 --> 24:15.829
[sighs] Oh.

24:16.037 --> 24:18.748
You look so handsome,
just like your dad.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.252
Yeah. Steve gave it to me.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.129
Even had it tailored to fit me.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.175
That is so sweet.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.636
And I love that you wanted to wear it.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.846
Of course I did.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.598
It's Dad's special occasion suit.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.517
And you getting engaged to Steve
is a pretty special occasion.

24:39.269 --> 24:43.356
Jackson, you are turning into
a wonderful, mature man.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.985
-Your dad would be so proud of you.
-Thanks, Mom.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.030
And thank you, Steve.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.492
Really, there's no one I'd rather
have marry my mom.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.536
Thanks, man. That means the world to me.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.247

I'd rather spend my life with.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.046
Thank you.

25:07.589 --> 25:08.840
That's what families do.
