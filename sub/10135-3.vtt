08:22.294 --> 08:24.879
I told you we would

08:22.294 --> 08:24.879
get in trouble.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.134
Excuse me, if I may

08:27.174 --> 08:29.134
have your attention.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.803
I'd like to make a very

08:29.176 --> 08:31.803
important presentation

08:31.845 --> 08:34.389
entitled, "My own room.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.309
Together we can make it happen."

08:37.351 --> 08:39.478
The first point I'd like to

08:37.351 --> 08:39.478
make is that Stephanie--

08:39.519 --> 08:41.646
- Don't listen to her!

08:39.519 --> 08:41.646
- Thank you, Stephanie.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.691
You've just illustrated

08:41.688 --> 08:44.691
my first point.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.526
"Interruptions."

08:46.567 --> 08:48.111
I cannot talk on the phone

08:48.153 --> 08:50.155
do my homework or entertain

08:48.153 --> 08:50.155
my friends without her--

08:50.197 --> 08:52.782
That's ridiculous!

08:50.197 --> 08:52.782
I do not--

08:52.824 --> 08:54.617
Steph, let's hear what

08:52.824 --> 08:54.617
D.J. has to say

08:54.659 --> 08:56.870
and then you'll get

08:54.659 --> 08:56.870
your chance to interrupt.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.997
That's all I ask.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.708
Moving on to my next point.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.335
"Two different worlds."

09:03.377 --> 09:07.005
I go to high school.

09:03.377 --> 09:07.005
Land of maturity.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.924
Stephanie and Michelle

09:07.047 --> 09:09.924
go to elementary school.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.135
Tiny town.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.096
Now, they share a school,

09:12.177 --> 09:15.096
they should share a room.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.515
I object!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.183
I happen to be in fourth grade

09:18.225 --> 09:19.600
and have nothing in common

09:19.642 --> 09:22.312
with a kindergarten baby

09:19.642 --> 09:22.312
like Michelle.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.148
Who are you callin'

09:22.354 --> 09:25.148
a baby, baby?

09:27.317 --> 09:29.319
Children, please.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.071
To bring up my next point.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.781
"Strange but true facts."

09:33.823 --> 09:36.201
Stephanie and Michelle

09:33.823 --> 09:36.201
are the exact same ages

09:36.243 --> 09:39.037
Stephanie and I were when

09:36.243 --> 09:39.037
we started sharing a room.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.540
- Isn't that amazing?

09:39.079 --> 09:41.540
- That is amazing.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.790
It's like that thing

09:41.581 --> 09:42.790
where Kennedy

09:42.832 --> 09:44.459
had a secretary named Lincoln

09:44.501 --> 09:48.505
and Lincoln...had a secretary

09:44.501 --> 09:48.505
named Kennedy.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.802
What's amazing is you're able to

09:52.092 --> 09:54.802
dress yourself every morning.

09:58.890 --> 10:03.228
In conclusion, I've paid my dues

09:58.890 --> 10:03.228
and I deserve my own room.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.979
If there's any justice

10:03.270 --> 10:04.979
in this world

10:05.021 --> 10:06.856
then you'll set me free.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.649
Gentlemen, I thank you.

10:08.691 --> 10:12.612
Okay. Steph, do you

10:08.691 --> 10:12.612
have a rebuttal?

10:12.653 --> 10:15.823
No. But you should

10:12.653 --> 10:15.823
hear my side of this.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.454
Please don't make me

10:17.825 --> 10:20.454
live with a four-year-old baby.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.873
I'm not a baby.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.873
I'm four and three quarters.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.252
You're still a little shrimp.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.755
Stop calling me names,

10:27.294 --> 10:30.755
you cheesehead.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.966
Okay, that's enough, you two.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.594
Just give us guys a second

10:33.007 --> 10:35.594
and we're gonna talk this over.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.892
- Can I see chart number two--

10:40.307 --> 10:42.892
- Get in here.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.565
Okay. We've come to a decision.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.191
Dad, that's so unfair.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.235
You haven't even heard

10:50.233 --> 10:52.235
what I have to say yet.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.778
Sorry, just a habit.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.407
It just so happens that,

10:55.196 --> 10:57.407
uh, we agree with you.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.618
- You do?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.911
Yup. Starting this weekend

11:01.953 --> 11:03.913
Michelle is gonna move in

11:01.953 --> 11:03.913
with Stephanie

11:03.955 --> 11:06.374
and D.J., you're gonna

11:03.955 --> 11:06.374
get your own room.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.127
Finally, my own room!

11:06.416 --> 11:09.127
I have to go tell kimmy.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.880
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.880
Nice knowin' you, kid.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.428
Hey, guys, Lisa needs

11:15.258 --> 11:18.428
some help setting up.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.846
Any volunteers?

11:19.887 --> 11:21.014
Danny..

11:27.354 --> 11:29.523
- Honey, I'm a little chilly.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.523
- Hmmm?

11:29.564 --> 11:31.774
Could you get my wool socks?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.734
Well, sweetheart, all our winter

11:31.816 --> 11:33.734
stuff is up in the crawl space.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.570
You have to crawl up there

11:33.776 --> 11:35.570
and get all dirty and--

11:35.612 --> 11:37.322
Thank you, sweetheart.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.823
No problem, darling.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.701
Two more months. Just two.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.915
Well, Michelle, I guess

11:45.163 --> 11:47.915
it's just you and me.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.335
I don't wanna live with you.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.212
Why not? You look up to me.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.339
That's because I'm short.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.717
Michelle,

11:56.591 --> 11:58.717
we're gonna be roommates.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.179
This should be the happiest day

11:58.759 --> 12:01.179
of your life.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.805
Read my lips.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.391
[blows raspberry]

12:08.144 --> 12:10.313
Nobody wants to live with me.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.528
Comet...you don't know

12:15.026 --> 12:16.528
what it's like

12:16.570 --> 12:19.614
to have everyone against you.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.492
Well, D.J. and Michelle

12:19.656 --> 12:22.492
don't want to live with me.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.327
I'll just find a place

12:22.534 --> 12:24.327
of my own.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.373
Thanks for the offer

12:28.415 --> 12:30.917
but it might be a little crowded

12:28.415 --> 12:30.917
in your dog house.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.673
Breathe in.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.259
Breathe out.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.720
Breathe in.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.930
Cleansing breath.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.270
Okay, let's all take out

12:47.601 --> 12:50.270
our focus objects.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.105
Remember, this is what

12:50.311 --> 12:52.105
the mothers will be

12:52.146 --> 12:53.940
concentrating on during labor.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.025
Here you go, babe.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.025
Focus on the king.

13:00.863 --> 13:04.618
Jess, when you give birth,

13:00.863 --> 13:04.618
you focus on the king.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.204
Alright.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.415
- Better?

13:08.246 --> 13:10.415
- Much.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.753
Our last exercise

13:12.584 --> 13:14.753
will be deep breathing

13:14.793 --> 13:16.671
with our focus objects.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.132
Okay, try it again.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.132
Breathe in.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.676
Breathe out.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.676
Okay, keep going.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.722
- Hi, there.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.722
- Hi.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.974
You now, uh, if I seem

13:25.764 --> 13:27.974
a little advanced

13:28.015 --> 13:30.143
it's because I've already been

13:28.015 --> 13:30.143
through four births.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.562
My three daughters

13:30.184 --> 13:32.562
and...of course my own.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.650
You know, seein' my

13:34.731 --> 13:36.650
three girls bein' born

13:36.691 --> 13:38.901
was the most beautiful

13:36.691 --> 13:38.901
experience of my life.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.113
Yeah, tell me about it. When

13:38.943 --> 13:42.113
Fred and Wilma had Pebbles

13:42.155 --> 13:44.865
I cried for a week.

13:44.907 --> 13:49.329
[imitating Fred Flintstone]

13:44.907 --> 13:49.329
Yabba dabba doo!

13:50.747 --> 13:52.791
I love those voices you do.

13:52.831 --> 13:56.670
You know, uh, I do a few

13:52.831 --> 13:56.670
cartoon voices myself.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.672
[high-pitched]

13:56.711 --> 13:58.672
Hey, stop chasin' me,

13:56.711 --> 13:58.672
you mean cat.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.550
- That was really good.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.550
- 'Thanks.'

14:02.592 --> 14:04.385
Who was that?

14:04.427 --> 14:08.598
That was Tom. You know,

14:04.427 --> 14:08.598
little mouse from "Tom & Jerry."

14:08.640 --> 14:10.725
Tom was the cat,

14:08.640 --> 14:10.725
Jerry was the mouse

14:10.767 --> 14:12.686
and neither one of 'em

14:10.767 --> 14:12.686
ever talked.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.147
Get a life.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.778
Joey's right. I mean, Jerry

14:18.232 --> 14:21.778
is a mouse that never talks

14:21.820 --> 14:24.447
but what is fascinating is

14:21.820 --> 14:24.447
that Mickey, he's also a mouse.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.367
And he can just talk for hours

14:24.489 --> 14:27.367
on any subject.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.619
Yeah. Like, like Pluto,

14:27.408 --> 14:29.619
for instance. I mean..

14:29.661 --> 14:33.164
This guy's a dog, he wears a dog

14:29.661 --> 14:33.164
collar, and lives in a dog house

14:33.206 --> 14:35.249
yet Goofy, who's also a dog

14:35.291 --> 14:38.419
drives a car, plays golf

14:35.291 --> 14:38.419
and lives in a condo.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.715
[imitating Goofy]

14:38.461 --> 14:41.715
Hyuck! Hyuck!

14:41.756 --> 14:43.924
That is exactly what

14:41.756 --> 14:43.924
I was talking about.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.514
You know what? You two are

14:46.344 --> 14:49.514
actually perfect for each other.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.685
I'm sorry I tried to pick you

14:49.556 --> 14:53.685
up. I'll be right over here.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.981
Lisa, would you like to go out

14:55.812 --> 14:58.981
for pizza sometime?

14:59.023 --> 15:02.485
I'd love to go out with you...

14:59.023 --> 15:02.485
just as soon as class is over.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.988
- Class is over!

15:04.070 --> 15:05.988
- 'Snack time!'

15:07.073 --> 15:08.449
Alright, here's a little snack.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.077
Whoa! Watch out, guys,

15:08.491 --> 15:11.077
it's feeding time.

15:12.995 --> 15:17.834
Mmm. Mmm. Honey, you know what

15:12.995 --> 15:17.834
I just got a craving for?

15:17.876 --> 15:21.880
A nice slice of

15:17.876 --> 15:21.880
seedless watermelon.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.381
Doesn't that sound good?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.799
- Yeah! Sounds great!

15:23.423 --> 15:24.799
- Ooh!

15:24.841 --> 15:26.259
See the watermelon's

15:24.841 --> 15:26.259
out of season right now.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.094
I'd probably have to go to

15:26.300 --> 15:28.094
Mexico to get it.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.847
Well, you've got a car.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.643
Do you believe this, guys?

15:35.685 --> 15:37.353
S-she'd send me to Mexico

15:37.395 --> 15:39.564
to get her seedless watermelon.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.564
I mean, do you believe this?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.107
[murmuring]

15:41.148 --> 15:42.734
Well, wait a minute.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.734
Wait a minute.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.861
We shouldn't have to send them

15:44.903 --> 15:47.196
they should be happy to go.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.364
- Right! Yeah!

15:47.238 --> 15:48.364
- Yeah!

15:48.406 --> 15:50.283
Ho! Ho! Hold it, baby boomers.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.829
Now, goin' to the market, and

15:52.326 --> 15:54.829
stuff like that, that's fine.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.748
I-I'll go for that,

15:54.871 --> 15:56.748
but leavin' the country to get

15:56.790 --> 15:59.250
seedless watermelon 'cause

15:56.790 --> 15:59.250
you have some wacky craving..

15:59.292 --> 16:00.460
that's where I draw the line.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.378
(all)

16:00.501 --> 16:02.378
Yeah.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.798
Next thing you know she's gonna

16:02.420 --> 16:04.798
want Swiss chocolate.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.926
Ooh! That does sound good.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.260
- Yeah! Yeah!

16:07.967 --> 16:09.260
- Yeah!

16:09.302 --> 16:10.929
I'm not going to Switzerland.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.055
Jess, you're missing the point.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.266
It's not about where you go

16:15.308 --> 16:18.144
it's about you guys

16:15.308 --> 16:18.144
being there for us.

16:18.185 --> 16:21.689
I mean, okay, so maybe

16:18.185 --> 16:21.689
we're a little overemotional

16:21.731 --> 16:23.942
and maybe we do get

16:21.731 --> 16:23.942
a little demanding

16:23.983 --> 16:26.026
but that's because our

16:23.983 --> 16:26.026
hormones are running wild.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.987
I mean, we're happy,

16:26.068 --> 16:27.987
we're sad, we're hot

16:28.028 --> 16:29.864
we're cold, we're huge!

16:29.906 --> 16:32.742
And all we want are ridgy

16:29.906 --> 16:32.742
potato chips and a nice slice

16:32.784 --> 16:34.994
of juicy watermelon

16:32.784 --> 16:34.994
with a side of Swiss chocolate.

16:35.035 --> 16:38.038
Now, is that too much to ask?

16:35.035 --> 16:38.038
I don't think so!

16:47.214 --> 16:49.258
Now, sweetheart, no, no,

16:47.214 --> 16:49.258
no, no. I-I'm sorry.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.594
It's not too much to ask.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.596
I know the babies depend on you

16:51.636 --> 16:53.596
for everything

16:53.638 --> 16:56.265
so you should be able to

16:53.638 --> 16:56.265
depend on me. I'm sorry.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.976
Oh, Jess, what's wrong with me?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.812
I mean, you're so patient

16:58.017 --> 17:00.812
and understanding

17:00.854 --> 17:02.062
and I don't deserve you.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.148
No, no, you do.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.148
You deserve me.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.152
She deserves me.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.152
Right, guys?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.237
Yeah, now you wanna

17:08.194 --> 17:10.237
be my friend.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.534
I'm gonna be normal again

17:11.614 --> 17:14.534
someday, right?

17:14.575 --> 17:15.869
I hope so.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.082
May I help you?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.668
Just measuring my new room.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.213
Kimmy was right. There is

17:23.710 --> 17:27.213
enough room for a hot tub.

17:27.254 --> 17:31.634
Not so fast, sister.

17:27.254 --> 17:31.634
This is still my room.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.219
Michelle, you heard dad.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.179
You're moving in with Stephanie

17:33.260 --> 17:35.179
and I'm getting this room

17:35.221 --> 17:36.764
all to myself.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.476
You just stay in your room.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.476
Stephanie moved out.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.395
- No, she didn't.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.395
- Yes, she did.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.104
- No, she didn't.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.104
- Yes, she did.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.774
- No, she didn't.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.774
- Yes, she did.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.028
Why am I arguin'

17:46.816 --> 17:50.028
with a four-year-old?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.821
I'm four and three quarters!

17:57.117 --> 17:58.452
You're right, she's gone.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.747
Duh!

18:06.711 --> 18:08.295
Well, where did she go?

18:08.337 --> 18:09.672
Follow me.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.762
Stephanie?

18:19.974 --> 18:22.018
Did someone forget

18:19.974 --> 18:22.018
how to knock?

18:23.143 --> 18:24.896
Stephanie, what are you

18:23.143 --> 18:24.896
doing in here?

18:24.938 --> 18:27.398
I live here.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.398
Isn't it cool?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.984
I turned the sink

18:27.440 --> 18:29.984
into a wet bar.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.278
The tub into a waterbed.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.989
And I'm thinking of turning

18:32.319 --> 18:34.989
the toilet into a love seat.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.325
Hi, girls.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.080
Is there something

18:40.578 --> 18:42.080
you wanna tell me?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.290
Stephanie lives

18:42.121 --> 18:44.290
in the potty now.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.295
Oh, really?

18:49.336 --> 18:51.965
Well, I-I love what you've

18:49.336 --> 18:51.965
done with the place.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.009
Thanks. I've got the cable guy

18:52.006 --> 18:55.009
coming Tuesday.

18:56.677 --> 19:01.015
Honey...why did you

18:56.677 --> 19:01.015
move in here?

19:01.057 --> 19:03.434
Because I've got

19:01.057 --> 19:03.434
no place else to go.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.519
D.J. and Michelle

19:03.476 --> 19:05.519
don't wanna live with me.

19:07.021 --> 19:10.232
Girls, I don't like

19:07.021 --> 19:10.232
what I'm hearing.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.152
Maybe we should just rethink

19:10.274 --> 19:13.152
this idea of changing rooms.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.779
No, no. No rethinking.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.031
Your original thinking

19:14.821 --> 19:17.031
was perfect.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.492
Just give me a chance

19:17.073 --> 19:19.492
to work this all out.

19:19.533 --> 19:23.537
Okay, Deej. Heck, you've had

19:19.533 --> 19:23.537
enough dad-talks over the years.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.205
I think I've given you

19:23.579 --> 19:25.205
enough wisdom

19:25.247 --> 19:26.833
to handle this on your own.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.042
Thanks, dad.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.418
I won't even mention how

19:28.084 --> 19:29.418
important it is

19:29.460 --> 19:30.544
to treat each other

19:29.460 --> 19:30.544
with respect.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.088
I got it.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.674
I'm sorry, these dad-talks

19:32.130 --> 19:34.674
are hard to give up.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.803
Why don't you say

19:36.968 --> 19:38.803
we just skip the speech

19:38.845 --> 19:41.973
go straight to the hugs

19:38.845 --> 19:41.973
and we'll all start packing?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.557
No, thank you.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.853
Michelle!

19:46.894 --> 19:50.523
Great start, Deej.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.523
Dad would be proud.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.400
Uh, would you mind closing

19:50.564 --> 19:53.400
the door on your way out?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.945
Steph, come on.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.945
I've given you five years.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.613
Give me five minutes.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.532
Fine. Five minutes.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.076
Ready? Go.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.244
Steph, I know we can

20:02.118 --> 20:04.244
work this out.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.997
We always work things out.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.625
Yeah. But this time,

20:06.039 --> 20:09.625
it's personal.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.463
Steph, we've been through

20:11.377 --> 20:14.463
way too much together

20:14.505 --> 20:16.049
to throw it away now.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.300
We've laughed, we've cried.

20:18.342 --> 20:22.055
We weren't just roommates.

20:18.342 --> 20:22.055
We were soul mates.

20:22.096 --> 20:25.808
Very touching. Four minutes.

20:25.850 --> 20:29.520
Steph, if you stay in here,

20:25.850 --> 20:29.520
this could ruin everything.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.855
Is this some kinda revenge

20:30.897 --> 20:33.566
because I've been

20:30.897 --> 20:33.566
such a terrible sister?

20:33.607 --> 20:34.692
No.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.530
You've been a great sister.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.532
That's why I don't

20:39.572 --> 20:41.532
want you to leave.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.035
If you go,

20:41.574 --> 20:44.035
I'll miss everything.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.120
Listening in on your

20:44.077 --> 20:46.120
phone calls.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.164
Hearing if you got a date

20:46.162 --> 20:48.164
for the weekend.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.290
Then reading your diary

20:48.206 --> 20:50.290
to see how it went.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.586
Steph, I'll be right

20:51.625 --> 20:53.586
down the hall.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.755
You can visit me

20:53.627 --> 20:55.755
whenever you want.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.758
My door is always open.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.758
Unless it's closed.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.135
And then you knock.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.429
But it won't be the same.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.639
No, not exactly the same.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.308
You're gonna be the

21:05.681 --> 21:08.308
big sister in the room.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.270
Michelle's gonna look up to you

21:08.350 --> 21:11.270
just like you looked up to me.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.440
But one thing will never change

21:14.481 --> 21:17.526
I'll always be your big sister

21:14.481 --> 21:17.526
and I'll always love you.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.613
I'll always love you too, Deej.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.787
Well, now that we have

21:25.701 --> 21:27.787
the old team back together

21:27.828 --> 21:30.831
maybe between the two of us,

21:27.828 --> 21:30.831
we can outsmart Michelle.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.332
Piece of cake.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.672
Michelle, can we come in?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.092
(Michelle)

21:38.714 --> 21:41.092
'Whose room is this?'

21:41.134 --> 21:43.136
It's your room.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.428
'Okay, come in.'

21:46.180 --> 21:48.682
Welcome to my room.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.559
Michelle, if you don't move

21:48.724 --> 21:50.559
you're missing out

21:50.601 --> 21:52.394
on a wonderful experience.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.564
Living with Stephanie was

21:52.436 --> 21:55.564
the happiest time of my life.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.733
Then why don't you keep her?

21:59.193 --> 22:01.946
Well, um, I've been

21:59.193 --> 22:01.946
happy long enough.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.489
It's time for you to be happy.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.449
This is my gift to you.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.747
Michelle...why don't you

22:07.994 --> 22:11.747
wanna live with me?

22:11.789 --> 22:15.209
Because you called me

22:11.789 --> 22:15.209
a kindergarten baby.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.961
I'm sorry.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.714
What I meant to say was,

22:17.003 --> 22:20.714
you're in kindergarten, baby!

22:23.092 --> 22:25.094
Nice try.

22:25.136 --> 22:28.555
Come on, if you live with me,

22:25.136 --> 22:28.555
I'll give you a bag of cookies.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.766
Okay, I'll live with you.

22:30.808 --> 22:35.146
- Really?

22:30.808 --> 22:35.146
- You're lucky I love cookies.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.690
Well, Michelle,

22:35.188 --> 22:37.690
now that we're living together

22:37.731 --> 22:39.942
I only have one rule.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.942
I'm the boss.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.028
- No. I'm the boss.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.071
- I'm the boss.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.071
- Oh, this is beautiful.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.867
You two were made

22:44.113 --> 22:47.867
for each other.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.451
- No, I am.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.451
- I am.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.079
- No. I'm the boss.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.079
- I'm the boss.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.747
Yes!

22:56.709 --> 22:58.585
