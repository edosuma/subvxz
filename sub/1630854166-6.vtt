Daniel will give you
whatever you want for it.

00:31.615 --> 00:32.741

00:32.741 --> 00:34.535

you would have forgiven Daddy

04:45.827 --> 04:46.954
- Anything good?

04:46.954 --> 04:51.083
- Just a couple of cryptic notes
and initials I couldn't decipher,

04:51.083 --> 04:52.876

04:52.876 --> 04:53.961

How do you know?

- Why can't you just love me
the way that I love you, Krystal?

05:02.970 --> 05:05.848
- Now, children,
we cannot hold on to this laptop.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.225
It's unethical,
and actually, it's illegal.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.644
Eventually, we're gonna
have to turn this over to the prosecution

05:10.644 --> 05:11.979
and submit it into evidence.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.898
But we also cannot let Brayden know
that we have the laptop

05:14.898 --> 05:17.401

to have the laptop right now.

what Kaleesha was gonna whistleblow

05:21.113 --> 05:23.073
about Brayden's company before Mike does.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.450
- He might already know.
You don't think Fallon told him?

05:25.450 --> 05:27.661

about Brayden's dirty little secrets,

05:27.661 --> 05:28.996

Why are you guys looking at me
like I'm the crazy one?

05:37.379 --> 05:41.800

that Mike is able to decipher something

05:41.800 --> 05:43.010
from the laptop that we weren't,

05:43.010 --> 05:44.845

If you don't tell us what Kaleesha
was gonna expose about Clout,

05:56.440 --> 05:59.610
I promise you,
it will be used against you in some way.

I am bound by my legal duty not to repeat.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.910

but I'm telling you,
no one else knows besides Theo.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.955

06:11.955 --> 06:14.583
- Yes. I've known him
since I was 18 years old.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.752
- And you're sure
he hasn't told anyone else?

06:16.752 --> 06:17.753
- Yes.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.758
- Brayden, if you're worried
about your company selling--

06:22.758 --> 06:25.677
- Honestly, I'm not even sure
I wanna sell anymore.

06:26.303 --> 06:30.349
Since Kaleesha... I'll just say
it's put things in perspective.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.685

I have to think about my company.

a possible suspect, it's him.

08:38.810 --> 08:42.564
You will learn that Mr. Miller

who, in fact, was unfaithful
to his wife with Kaleesha Moore.

08:47.069 --> 08:50.197

in favor of something easier.

08:54.826 --> 08:55.953
Tunnel vision.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.997
- Our evidence and testimony
will establish the following:

09:00.374 --> 09:04.586
The defendant was on the brink
of his biggest achievement yet--

09:04.586 --> 09:06.421
becoming a billionaire.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.509
A very elite club that not many people,

including a person of color, get into.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.769
That cost was the life of Kaleesha Moore.

who they believed committed the crime,

that they are now hoping you will believe.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.906

dedicated four years of her life

09:32.906 --> 09:35.242

build up his company.

09:35.242 --> 09:39.538
But because Mrs. Moore was going to
share with the world damaging information

09:39.538 --> 09:43.333

the defendant from becoming a billionaire,

09:43.333 --> 09:45.586

09:46.461 --> 09:49.756

You will see that it is not based
on real evidence or hard facts.

It is only based on assumptions,
incompetence and, frankly, laziness.

was the primary suspect?

18:52.174 --> 18:53.175
