<i>Fuck Wolverine.</i>

02:17.079 --> 02:19.665
<i>First, he rides my coattails
with the R rating.</i>

02:19.790 --> 02:23.835
<i>Then the hairy motherfucker
ups the ante by dying.</i>

02:24.253 --> 02:25.963
<i>What a dick.</i>

02:26.463 --> 02:28.257
<i>Well, guess what, Wolvie?</i>

02:28.715 --> 02:30.634
<i>I'm dying in this one, too.</i>

02:34.304 --> 02:36.640
<i>To understand
why I took a cat-nap</i>

02:36.723 --> 02:38.809
<i>on 1,200 gallons
of high-test fuel...</i>

02:38.892 --> 02:40.185
<i>I need to take you back</i>

02:40.269 --> 02:42.604
<i>to the dewy slopes
of six weeks ago.</i>

02:42.729 --> 02:43.981
<i>I'd gone international,</i>

02:44.064 --> 02:46.024
<i>taking out mass murderers,
gangsters,</i>

02:46.108 --> 02:47.484
<i>unspeakable monsters.</i>

02:47.859 --> 02:50.571
<i>People nobody would touch.
Except me.</i>

02:50.821 --> 02:52.739
<i>I'm gonna touch them all over.</i>

02:56.451 --> 02:58.328
<i>Hey, it's Gail calling.</i>

02:58.412 --> 02:59.496
<i>Love the shiny suit.</i>

02:59.580 --> 03:00.581
<i>Really brings out</i>

03:00.664 --> 03:02.207
<i>the sex trafficker in your eyes.</i>

03:02.291 --> 03:04.459
Whatever they're paying,
I'll double it.

03:04.626 --> 03:07.671
I don't
speak Cantonese, Mister...

03:08.630 --> 03:10.716
Well, I'm not even gonna
attempt that.

03:10.799 --> 03:13.427
But I did take 8th grade Spanish, so...

03:13.552 --> 03:15.596
Where is the library?

03:15.721 --> 03:17.723
Which literally
translates to...

03:18.515 --> 03:21.143
I don't bargain,
pumpkin fucker.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.031
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.324
I am so sorry.

03:35.407 --> 03:37.087
I thought this was
an anal-bleaching party.

03:59.598 --> 04:01.058
Don't worry.
You're not going to die.

04:01.516 --> 04:03.560
Although these will kill you.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.645
Hit it, Dolly.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.541
I'm merely
a vessel for the Lord.

04:37.803 --> 04:40.389
Taking the hands out
of the guns of the criminals!

04:47.896 --> 04:50.440
Whoo! Do not go in there!

04:57.155 --> 04:59.241
Let's see
Captain America do that.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.710
Too exotic?

05:32.065 --> 05:33.400
I don't bargain.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.795
Oh, God! Oh, God,
time out! Time out!

06:34.878 --> 06:38.381
Cut. I've got bad guy blood,
right in my open eye.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.217
Oh, that's so gross.

06:41.593 --> 06:42.636
Fuck.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.712
Looks like you left
a little landing strip there.

06:45.722 --> 06:46.765
I like it.

06:51.895 --> 06:53.522
Oh, man!

06:57.859 --> 06:59.778
<i>My world tour
brought me home</i>

06:59.861 --> 07:02.197
<i>to this guy,
Sergei Valishnikov.</i>

07:02.364 --> 07:03.824
<i>But we'll get to him
in a moment.</i>

07:03.907 --> 07:05.267
<i>'Cause I know
what you're thinking.</i>

07:05.325 --> 07:08.119
<i>"I'm so glad
I left the kiddos at home."</i>

07:08.203 --> 07:09.454
<i>But that's where
you'd be wrong.</i>

07:09.538 --> 07:12.582
<i>That babysitter of yours
is high as fuck right now...</i>

07:12.707 --> 07:16.962
<i>and, believe it or not,
Deadpool 2 is a family film.</i>

07:17.045 --> 07:18.088
<i>True story.</i>

07:18.171 --> 07:22.050
<i>And every good family film
starts with a vicious murder.</i>

07:22.133 --> 07:25.178
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

07:25.262 --> 07:28.515
<i>Holy shit pickles!
That guy's on fire.</i>

07:28.598 --> 07:31.476
<i>That's not CGI, folks.
He's actually on fire.</i>

07:31.560 --> 07:34.896
<i>Yeah. You know I get paid
to take out bad guys, right?</i>

07:34.980 --> 07:36.064
<i>But this guy?</i>

07:36.147 --> 07:38.233
<i>He was
one of the worst of 'em.</i>

07:40.902 --> 07:42.404
<i>Hurry up and open
this fucking door,</i>

07:42.487 --> 07:43.767
<i>and let's kill
this motherfucker!</i>

07:50.704 --> 07:52.330
<i>Ugh. So gross.</i>

07:52.789 --> 07:55.166
<i>A panic room? Really?</i>

07:55.667 --> 07:57.836
Can you come out?

07:57.919 --> 08:01.006
I really have to go.
It's my anniversary.

08:06.928 --> 08:08.221
<i>Over and
over, I hear people say,</i>

08:08.305 --> 08:09.785
<i>"I just don't have
enough confidence."</i>

08:09.848 --> 08:12.017
<i>Listen, confidence is not
something you have.</i>

08:12.100 --> 08:13.351
<i>It's something you create.</i>

08:13.435 --> 08:15.437
<i>And you can create it
at any moment in time.</i>

08:15.562 --> 08:17.230
<i>A sense of confidence
is nothing</i>

08:17.314 --> 08:18.680
<i>but a sense of power
within yourself...</i>

08:18.690 --> 08:20.640
a <i>sense of certainty that
you can pull something off.</i>

08:20.650 --> 08:22.694
Start the fucking car!

08:22.777 --> 08:23.862
Dopinder!

08:23.945 --> 08:25.488
Start the fucking car!

08:30.160 --> 08:32.495
Shoot that motherfucker!
Shoot him!

08:32.703 --> 08:34.203
- Whoo!
- Oh, I shit my pants.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.625
Actually, that may
have been me.

08:36.707 --> 08:37.918
Oh, mission accomplished?

08:38.001 --> 08:40.086
Oh, in a George W.
sort of way.

08:40.169 --> 08:41.837
Fucker can't stay
in a panic room forever.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.340
Oh, you're living
the dreams, DP.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.550
It has been
quite the run, Dopinder,

08:45.634 --> 08:46.843
<i>and who' da thought'?</i>

08:46.927 --> 08:48.970
Now I'm talked about
in the same sentence as Jesus.

08:49.471 --> 08:51.306
<i>Passion of the Christ,
then me.</i>

08:51.389 --> 08:52.599
At least domestically.

08:52.682 --> 08:53.850
We beat them overseas,

08:53.934 --> 08:55.894
where there's no such thing
as religion.

08:55.977 --> 08:58.146
I do want to live
the dreams, Pool Boy.

08:58.229 --> 09:00.523
Taxiing is not as sexy
as it looks.

09:00.649 --> 09:02.399
- I want to fill my...
- Pockets?

09:02.484 --> 09:05.654
What's your poison?
A little, uh, cokey cokey?

09:05.737 --> 09:07.030
Can't maintain an erection

09:07.113 --> 09:08.531
without buying shoes online?

09:08.698 --> 09:10.617
I've never experienced
that last one.

09:10.700 --> 09:11.910
Talk to me, Goose.

09:11.993 --> 09:14.788
I was going to say "soul".
I want to fill my soul.

09:14.871 --> 09:17.832
I want to belong to something,
like you, Pool, sir.

09:17.999 --> 09:19.501
- Dopinder...
- Hmm?

09:20.001 --> 09:21.836
You never cease
to surprise me.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.966
You know, the depth of
your heart is extraordinary.

09:26.049 --> 09:27.676
We all need
a sense of belonging.

09:27.759 --> 09:29.511
We all need
a genuine sense of home.

09:29.594 --> 09:30.679
A place in this world.

09:30.762 --> 09:32.122
I want to become
a contract killer.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.640
I'm sorry. What did you say?

09:34.015 --> 09:35.934
Remember when
I kidnapped Bandhu

09:36.017 --> 09:37.384
and threatened him
with great violence?

09:37.394 --> 09:38.728
You kind of killed him.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.637
<i>And then remember the</i> movie
<i>Interview with the Vampire?</i>

09:40.647 --> 09:41.773
Don't want to.

09:41.856 --> 09:42.899
When Tom Cruise fed

09:42.983 --> 09:44.776
10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst blood

09:44.859 --> 09:46.027
for the first time...

09:46.111 --> 09:48.488
and she looked up
at his smooth,

09:48.571 --> 09:50.782
handsome face and said...

09:51.574 --> 09:53.326
"I want some more."

09:53.410 --> 09:57.038
Oh, Pool, picture me,
a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

09:58.081 --> 10:00.083
I'll never not picture that.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.585
But I can't wait
to never speak of this,

10:02.669 --> 10:04.045
as soon as possible.

10:04.754 --> 10:07.257
We're here.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.974
Dopinder, it's me again.

10:16.057 --> 10:17.726
Look, a saner man
might discourage you

10:17.809 --> 10:19.644
from joining
the deadly merc business...

10:19.728 --> 10:21.146
what, with your concave chest

10:21.229 --> 10:22.856
and your
paper towel tube arms.

10:22.939 --> 10:24.607
But you're an eagle...

10:24.691 --> 10:26.651
and goddamn it,
an eagle's gotta soar.

10:26.735 --> 10:28.069
You gotta grab those dreams,

10:28.153 --> 10:29.738
grab those dreams
by the dick tip...

10:29.821 --> 10:31.322
and make it rain!

10:31.406 --> 10:33.283
I don't know what that means.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.326
Me neither.

10:35.910 --> 10:37.370
I'm gonna see you...

10:38.705 --> 10:40.040
at the office.

10:40.623 --> 10:41.708
In the sky.

10:41.791 --> 10:42.834
You're my Tom Cruise!

10:42.917 --> 10:44.544
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

10:44.627 --> 10:45.879
Kristen? Kirsten?

10:51.134 --> 10:52.719
Sorry I'm late.

10:52.802 --> 10:54.345
There was a bunch of

10:54.429 --> 10:56.473
handicapable children
stuck in a tree...

10:56.556 --> 10:57.806
- and I had to, uh...
- Uh-uh.

10:58.099 --> 11:00.810
You're right.
I was fighting a caped badass.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.146
But then we discovered
his mom is named Martha, too.

11:03.271 --> 11:05.231
- No.
- You got me.

11:05.648 --> 11:07.408
I was rounding up
all the gluten in the world

11:07.484 --> 11:08.684
and launching it into space...

11:08.735 --> 11:10.737
where it can't not
hurt us ever again.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.072
Try again.

11:12.655 --> 11:14.074
Diarrhea?

11:14.240 --> 11:16.000
We can't be sure
until I get this suit off...

11:16.951 --> 11:18.912
but, uh,
all signs point to yes.

11:20.830 --> 11:21.831
Traffic?

11:22.457 --> 11:23.500
Hmm?

11:24.709 --> 11:26.294
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

11:26.377 --> 11:27.378
Well, come here.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.850
I'm gonna shower
and get out of this suit.

11:41.601 --> 11:42.727
Don't you want
your surprise?

11:42.811 --> 11:44.646
Do I look like
a patient burn victim?

11:45.438 --> 11:46.689
I got one for you, too.

11:47.816 --> 11:49.192
Happy anniversary, baby.

11:49.359 --> 11:50.944
Open, open, open.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.280
Skee-Ball token.

11:54.739 --> 11:56.074
Our first date.

11:56.157 --> 11:57.408
Yup.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.453
That's genuine,
high-grade lead.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.250
I'll keep it forever.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.127
Thank you, baby.

12:08.753 --> 12:10.463
- Open yours.
- All right, all right.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.674
Oh...

12:14.050 --> 12:15.959
That's just the most
beautiful thing that I've...

12:15.969 --> 12:17.303
I don't know
what this is.

12:17.387 --> 12:18.888
My IUD.

12:19.264 --> 12:20.265
A bomb?

12:20.348 --> 12:23.143
No, dick for brains.
My birth control device.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.723
What, you mean that your...

12:24.769 --> 12:26.479
Baby factory's open
for business.

12:26.563 --> 12:27.647
Oh, my God!

12:27.897 --> 12:31.109
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

12:31.192 --> 12:34.028
Or a little girl!
Definitely one or the other!

12:34.320 --> 12:37.115
Oh! And I want our kid
to have only one name.

12:37.699 --> 12:40.243
Like Cher or Todd.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.745
You gotta pump a baby
in me first, cowboy.

12:42.829 --> 12:43.830
Yes, I do.

12:43.913 --> 12:45.738
Let's watch some porn
and show that bed who's boss.

12:45.748 --> 12:46.749
Let's do that.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.419
<i>Papa...</i>

12:50.128 --> 12:52.297
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

12:53.756 --> 12:56.092
<i>Papa, can you see me?</i>

12:56.426 --> 12:58.678
Does this song
sound familiar to you?

13:00.972 --> 13:02.432
May.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.895
Connor, if it's a boy.
May, if it's a girl.

13:09.564 --> 13:11.941
So weird.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.444
Family was always
an F-word to me.

13:15.945 --> 13:19.157
My pile of shit father
took off and bailed.

13:20.325 --> 13:22.535
I mean, it's not like I have
a lot of strong role models

13:22.619 --> 13:24.329
to draw off of for Todd.

13:25.496 --> 13:28.124
Hey. Look at me.

13:29.292 --> 13:31.461
You are not your father.

13:33.171 --> 13:34.589
Besides...

13:34.672 --> 13:39.385
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

13:40.386 --> 13:41.387
But here's the thing,

13:41.471 --> 13:43.014
isn't that how
it always works?

13:43.348 --> 13:44.849
Like in Star Wars,

13:44.933 --> 13:46.976
men are destined
to become their father...

13:47.685 --> 13:50.730
and then have consensual sex
with their sister?

13:50.813 --> 13:53.233
I think you missed
big, big chunks of that movie.

13:54.150 --> 13:56.361
No, I'm pretty sure
Luke nailed her.

13:56.444 --> 13:58.071
<i>Baby, that's Empire.</i>

13:58.571 --> 14:01.157
The point is, kids...

14:02.659 --> 14:05.286
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.248
Better than we used to be.

14:08.831 --> 14:11.334
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

14:12.377 --> 14:13.753
I'm gonna go make dessert.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.215
You get the strap-on.
Let's make a super baby.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.843
Pretty sure it doesn't work
that way, but we can try.

14:22.011 --> 14:25.473
What about Krystal?
But with a "K"?

14:25.556 --> 14:27.475
It's too stripper-y.

14:27.558 --> 14:29.060
Kevin With a "K"!

14:29.143 --> 14:31.229
No, too stripper-y, too.

14:31.813 --> 14:33.398
Uh, Earl!

14:33.773 --> 14:36.067
He's gonna go straight to jail

14:36.150 --> 14:37.944
if we name him Earl.

14:38.403 --> 14:40.280
What about Bruce?

14:41.281 --> 14:42.448
No.

14:42.782 --> 14:43.783
Get down.

14:43.866 --> 14:45.243
What?

15:14.147 --> 15:15.898
Baby? Baby?

15:19.485 --> 15:20.570
I'm okay.

15:21.237 --> 15:23.740
Thank God I didn't have to use
the cream cheese spreader.

15:58.483 --> 15:59.776
Please.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.657
Please. Please.

16:06.741 --> 16:09.786
Baby, I'm so sorry.

16:09.952 --> 16:13.748
No!

19:18.266 --> 19:20.977
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

19:21.936 --> 19:23.436
Is it just me, or does

19:23.450 --> 19:25.350
<i>"Do You Want to Build
a Snowman?"</i> from Frozen...

19:25.356 --> 19:26.607
sound suspiciously like

19:26.691 --> 19:28.609
"<i>Papa, Can You Hear Me?"</i>
from Yentl?

19:30.027 --> 19:32.154
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

19:33.948 --> 19:36.492
And nobody
fucking realizes it.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.119
Wade, you gotta go home.

19:38.202 --> 19:40.788
You've been sitting here
for three days, okay?

19:40.997 --> 19:44.542
You smell like sauerkraut
left in the warm rain.

19:44.709 --> 19:47.003
Like wet garbage
in hot urine.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.213
You smell like
a dog ate kitty litter...

19:49.297 --> 19:51.299
and then farted his way
out of the living room.

19:51.382 --> 19:53.175
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

19:53.259 --> 19:54.802
couch cushions
after Shark Week.

19:55.136 --> 19:56.512
I love Frozen.

19:56.887 --> 20:00.099
I loved her. I loved her
like an ocean loves water.

20:00.516 --> 20:01.601
An ocean is water.

20:01.684 --> 20:06.355
More importantly, I liked her.
I really liked her, you know?

20:06.856 --> 20:07.982
George Michael was right.

20:08.065 --> 20:09.900
I'm never gonna
dance again. Fuck!

20:10.484 --> 20:11.485
He's dead, too.

20:12.653 --> 20:13.988
At least we still have Bowie.

20:14.071 --> 20:15.740
Oh, Mr. Pool.
David Bowie is...

20:15.823 --> 20:16.824
Uh, uh, uh...

20:17.158 --> 20:18.284
still with us.

20:18.367 --> 20:21.245
We do.
We'll always have Bowie.

20:21.829 --> 20:22.830
I'm sorry.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.206
Shot after shot,

20:24.290 --> 20:26.282
it's not gonna change the fact
that I think you're...

20:26.292 --> 20:27.950
Are you pissing?
Are you urinating right now?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.713
You're making the face that
you make when you urinate.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.340
- Is he pissing?
- I'm on it!

20:32.506 --> 20:33.966
There you go, Dopinder.

20:34.050 --> 20:36.052
If you want to be
a contract killer...

20:36.135 --> 20:38.638
you gotta handle a mop
before you handle a gun.

20:38.721 --> 20:39.795
Although I don't
quite understand

20:39.805 --> 20:41.015
how they are at all similar.

20:41.098 --> 20:43.476
'Cause I could shove either
one up your ass and kill you.

20:43.559 --> 20:44.644
Now, leave me.

20:44.727 --> 20:45.728
I get it.

20:46.270 --> 20:47.813
Go home, Wade.

20:47.897 --> 20:50.274
I don't have a home,
Weas, you know. I got a...

20:51.692 --> 20:53.069
Okay, I'm fine.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.153
I'm fine.

20:54.236 --> 20:56.113
You know what "fine"
stands for, Wade?

20:56.197 --> 20:59.533
Fucked up, insecure,
needy, and emotional.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.202
According to the...

21:02.536 --> 21:03.704
- <i>Kubler-Ross.</i>
- Yeah.

21:04.038 --> 21:05.831
According to
the Kubler-Ross model...

21:05.915 --> 21:08.668
denial is just one of
the five stages of grief.

21:08.751 --> 21:10.711
Jesus Christ, Buck!

21:11.170 --> 21:13.089
No more speaking lines
for you.

21:21.722 --> 21:24.058
<i>Hey, bud. Bud.</i>

21:24.141 --> 21:25.935
<i>- Huh?
- Got a match?</i>

21:26.268 --> 21:27.269
<i>Match?</i>

21:27.812 --> 21:29.146
<i>Yes, I have one right here.</i>

21:29.230 --> 21:30.710
<i>Don't make</i> a <i>move.
This is</i> a <i>stick-up.</i>

21:30.731 --> 21:32.441
<i>- What?
- You heard me.</i>

21:32.525 --> 21:34.527
<i>Mister, Mister,
put down that gun.</i>

21:34.610 --> 21:37.196
<i>Shut up. Now, come on.
Your money or your life?</i>

21:45.413 --> 21:49.041
<i>Look, bud. I said,
"Your money or your life."</i>

21:49.208 --> 21:50.209
"I'm thinking it over!"

21:50.543 --> 21:51.877
Motherfuck!

21:51.961 --> 21:53.045
Fuck!

21:56.006 --> 21:57.466
The hell you doin' here?

21:57.550 --> 21:58.968
Don't you know how to knock?

21:59.677 --> 22:01.554
I thought you saw me...

22:01.600 --> 22:02.950
with your ears.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.300
You're lucky I didn't
shoot you in the...

22:04.306 --> 22:05.306
The wall?

22:05.391 --> 22:08.769
The refrigerator?
I'm in so much pain.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.149
I heard the news,
sweetie.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.984
I'm very sorry. I am.

22:15.359 --> 22:16.819
What am I gonna do, Al?

22:17.319 --> 22:19.029
Probably something terrible.

22:20.197 --> 22:21.449
Knowing you.

22:21.615 --> 22:23.159
It was my fault.

22:24.368 --> 22:26.245
I fucking did this.

22:27.121 --> 22:28.914
And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

22:28.998 --> 22:31.000
and tell her that I'm sorry,
and I can't.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.587
She's gone.

22:34.670 --> 22:38.090
Sweetheart,
can you speak up?

22:38.507 --> 22:39.717
It's a little hard
to hear you

22:39.800 --> 22:41.469
with that pity dick
in your mouth.

22:41.552 --> 22:44.555
Now, look, sugar.
You need to just keep living.

22:44.638 --> 22:45.639
Thank you...

22:45.723 --> 22:48.934
Matthew McConaughey,
your words are a treasure.

22:49.018 --> 22:51.061
Listen to the pain.

22:51.145 --> 22:53.856
It's both history teacher
and fortune teller.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.817
Pain teaches us
who we are, Wade.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.863
Sometimes, it's so bad,
we feel like we're dying.

23:01.530 --> 23:04.241
But we can't really live till
we've died a little, can we?

23:06.744 --> 23:07.953
Wade?

23:10.414 --> 23:12.314
- Wade?
- I'm right here, Althea.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.211
And that is
the most beautiful thing

23:15.294 --> 23:16.504
I've ever heard.

23:17.254 --> 23:18.798
And you're absolutely right.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.012
I'm about to do
something terrible.

23:31.060 --> 23:32.353
Precious, aren't they?

23:33.187 --> 23:34.563
Whoa!

23:34.647 --> 23:36.065
Are you a superhero?

23:36.148 --> 23:37.775
Fucking A, sweetie.

23:37.858 --> 23:39.401
What's your name?

23:39.485 --> 23:41.237
Captain Delicious Pants.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.489
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

24:08.848 --> 24:10.808
I can't believe
he's still alive.

24:10.891 --> 24:13.394
I can't believe you left
the house in that shirt.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.772
There's gotta be
some way to die.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.858
I just need to die harder.

24:18.941 --> 24:20.067
Trademark Fox.

24:20.234 --> 24:21.235
Y'all caught up now?

24:34.498 --> 24:36.083
<i>Open for business.</i>

24:40.004 --> 24:41.755
<i>Your crazy
matches my crazy.</i>

24:42.172 --> 24:44.216
<i>I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.</i>

24:44.383 --> 24:45.467
<i>Skee-Ball token.</i>

24:45.551 --> 24:46.831
<i>You're a lot smarter
than I look.</i>

24:52.850 --> 24:53.966
<i>About why
we're so good together.</i>

24:53.976 --> 24:55.311
<i>I love you,
Wade Wilson.</i>

24:57.980 --> 24:59.398
Ness?

25:00.858 --> 25:01.984
Ness?

25:02.818 --> 25:03.819
Ness.

25:04.445 --> 25:07.114
Ness, there's something here.
I can't get to you.

25:08.824 --> 25:10.910
Your heart's not
in the right place.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.245
Wait, hold on. What?

25:14.079 --> 25:16.165
Your heart's not
in the right place.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.291
Wait. What do you mean

25:17.374 --> 25:19.334
my heart's not in the right
place? What does it...

25:38.854 --> 25:41.398
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Wade.

25:41.857 --> 25:42.942
You're broken.

25:43.025 --> 25:45.986
Oh, God.
I know that voice.

26:07.049 --> 26:08.467
Well, Russell.

26:08.550 --> 26:11.220
I hear you're handy
at picking locks.

26:12.596 --> 26:14.765
There will be no need
for that here.

26:14.848 --> 26:18.143
There's no locks on our doors,
no bars on our windows.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.522
I know what you're thinking.

26:21.605 --> 26:23.691
Why don't the kids just run?

26:24.316 --> 26:26.860
Who would choose to stay
in such a place?

26:27.277 --> 26:29.321
You stay because...

26:29.822 --> 26:34.535
deep down inside, you know
you're unfit to leave.

26:38.372 --> 26:39.957
Don't worry.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.793
We can fix that.

26:47.631 --> 26:51.385
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.992
"Heart's in the right place."

27:15.075 --> 27:16.567
"Heart's in the right..."
What does that mean?

27:16.577 --> 27:18.454
Take your mask off, Wade.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.122
I wish you'd said "pants".

27:20.247 --> 27:21.457
Let's play a game.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.001
It's called
"Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

27:24.084 --> 27:26.420
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.

27:26.503 --> 27:28.338
You don't need
to be funny here.

27:28.922 --> 27:30.090
We must talk.

27:30.215 --> 27:32.676
You need fresh start.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.261
Such a glare.

27:34.344 --> 27:36.513
It's like I'm on stage
at the Gaiety.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.141
With training,
you can be X-Man.

27:39.308 --> 27:41.393
You're wasting your time,
Shiny Jesus.

27:41.477 --> 27:42.728
I'm not X-Man material.

27:42.811 --> 27:44.396
Understatement of the year.

27:44.855 --> 27:45.856
Wade, Yukio.

27:46.315 --> 27:47.483
Yukio, Wade.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.360
What in the fuck knuckles
is this?

27:50.444 --> 27:52.321
She's my girlfriend,
you intolerant shit.

27:53.113 --> 27:54.907
Whoa! <i>Pump the hate brakes,
Fox</i> & <i>Friends.</i>

27:54.990 --> 27:56.825
I'm just surprised
anyone would date you.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.203
<i>Especially Pinkie Pie
from My Little Pony.</i>

27:59.578 --> 28:00.913
I like this guy.

28:01.455 --> 28:02.748
Give him a chance.

28:03.582 --> 28:04.698
It's great seeing you
like this.

28:04.708 --> 28:06.877
Yeah.

28:07.336 --> 28:08.337
Bye, Wade!

28:08.712 --> 28:11.131
Now, some ground rules
while under our roof.

28:11.215 --> 28:13.967
"Rule number one.
No killing...

28:14.051 --> 28:17.471
"anyone ever,
no matter how bad.

28:17.554 --> 28:20.140
"Rule two. Label everything
in refrigerator."

28:20.224 --> 28:21.225
Wade?

28:22.101 --> 28:23.185
Wade?

28:23.393 --> 28:25.143
- Don't try to chase me.
- Wade!

28:25.270 --> 28:27.314
I'm not ready
to be touched again.

28:27.397 --> 28:29.608
All these old guys
on the wall.

28:29.691 --> 28:31.777
Who lives here,
Calista Flockhart?

28:33.987 --> 28:36.365
Those were already damaged
after they fell there!

28:37.032 --> 28:38.867
What am I supposed
to do around here, anyway?

28:38.951 --> 28:41.161
Sit in a share circle,
talk about my feelings?

28:41.245 --> 28:43.831
And how would I
do that exactly?

28:44.164 --> 28:46.583
'Cause where the fuck
is everyone?

28:46.667 --> 28:47.751
It's always just you

28:47.835 --> 28:49.243
and Negasonic Teenage
Longest Name Ever...

28:49.253 --> 28:50.254
Enough!

28:50.546 --> 28:52.381
I said no touching!

28:54.133 --> 28:56.677
What the fuck?

28:57.469 --> 28:59.596
You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.723
One that doesn't end up
in my mouth.

29:02.558 --> 29:03.757
The first movie
made more money

29:03.767 --> 29:06.061
than the guy
who invented pants.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.272
They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?

29:08.355 --> 29:10.440
How 'bout that putz
with the giant pigeon wings?

29:10.524 --> 29:11.775
What do those do anyway, huh?

29:11.859 --> 29:13.277
Carry him
three feet off the ground

29:13.360 --> 29:15.279
to snatch up
the nearest muffin crumb?

29:15.487 --> 29:17.614
No, no, no!

29:17.698 --> 29:20.367
I am not X-Man material
at all.

29:20.450 --> 29:23.078
First off...

29:23.162 --> 29:25.205
I'm not even a virgin.
Second and more...

29:27.416 --> 29:28.458
I should have left you

29:28.542 --> 29:30.210
in the self-pitying mess
I found you in.

29:30.294 --> 29:33.338
But this is what friends do.
They show up!

29:33.422 --> 29:35.090
Not when convenient or easy.

29:35.465 --> 29:38.844
When hard,
and you always make it hard.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.264
You are unwell.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.433
I'm sticking my neck out
bringing you here.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.351
Wait.
One of the assholes

29:46.435 --> 29:47.936
who killed Vanessa got away.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.524
Oh, Jesus Christ!

29:52.733 --> 29:54.641
I thought you were gonna
kiss me for a second there.

29:54.651 --> 29:56.602
Please know I wouldn't be
able to stop you if you did.

29:56.612 --> 29:58.614
Wade, whoever they are...

29:58.697 --> 30:01.033
we track them down
and bring them to justice.

30:01.617 --> 30:03.035
It was me.

30:05.871 --> 30:07.456
I'm the asshole who got away.

30:08.582 --> 30:11.210
I killed every last one
of them, except me.

30:11.752 --> 30:13.462
Couldn't kill me.

30:16.590 --> 30:18.592
We were gonna start a family.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.304
We were, uh...

30:23.597 --> 30:25.307
We were gonna be a family.

30:26.099 --> 30:27.100
Wade...

30:27.267 --> 30:30.062
Vanessa is gone.
She's not coming back.

30:31.647 --> 30:33.941
This may not be
family you want...

30:34.024 --> 30:36.026
but it's family you need.

30:36.485 --> 30:37.736
You have a good heart.

30:37.819 --> 30:39.363
It belongs here
where it can grow.

30:41.156 --> 30:42.157
What did you say?

30:44.201 --> 30:45.535
About my heart?

30:50.958 --> 30:52.960
I think
I'm in the right place.

32:00.777 --> 32:03.530
I'mma tell you
what the big lie is.

32:03.613 --> 32:05.198
Toilet paper.

32:05.282 --> 32:06.658
What's so bad
about toilet paper?

32:06.742 --> 32:07.909
Gets the job done.

32:07.993 --> 32:10.829
Does it really
get the job done?

32:10.912 --> 32:13.081
All right. Say you wake up
tomorrow morning...

32:13.165 --> 32:17.836
and, hypothetically, find some
fresh shit on your face.

32:17.919 --> 32:19.639
Your cheek, maybe
a little bit in the beard.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.371
What the hell?
I'm about to be fucking sick!

32:21.381 --> 32:22.424
What do you do?

32:22.507 --> 32:23.800
Do you go to a bathroom

32:23.884 --> 32:25.510
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue...

32:25.594 --> 32:27.429
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit

32:27.512 --> 32:29.056
and then go on,
get on with your day?

32:29.139 --> 32:30.724
Go to church,
maybe dinner and a movie,

32:30.807 --> 32:31.892
like nothing happened?

32:31.975 --> 32:33.310
Where is this
coming from, man?

32:33.393 --> 32:34.603
But something did happen.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.104
Your face smells like shit.
Right?

32:36.188 --> 32:37.731
So what you would do,

32:37.814 --> 32:40.025
is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

32:40.108 --> 32:42.402
and you would scrub
the fucking shit

32:42.486 --> 32:44.446
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.198
You could not
scrub it enough.

32:46.281 --> 32:47.921
Are you trying
to make me feel disgusting?

32:47.991 --> 32:49.159
I'm starting to feel...

32:49.242 --> 32:51.912
Toilet paper is
a plenty fine appetizer.

32:51.995 --> 32:54.081
But, then...

32:54.331 --> 32:56.625
Huggies Natural Care
wet wipes.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.043
That's your main course.

32:58.126 --> 33:01.254
They're soft, they're moist.
They're for babies.

33:02.089 --> 33:04.841
Finally, one more pass
with toilet paper,

33:04.925 --> 33:06.802
maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.470
Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

33:08.553 --> 33:09.846
if you can get you
a hair dryer.

33:09.930 --> 33:12.265
Just about 30 seconds
would do you good.

33:15.977 --> 33:16.978
The fuck?

33:18.230 --> 33:19.272
Year.

33:20.273 --> 33:21.274
What?

33:22.484 --> 33:24.111
What year is it?

33:24.194 --> 33:26.655
What kind of dumbass question
is that to ask?

33:57.394 --> 34:00.144
<i>We have 8 weeks
of boot camp ahead of us, men.</i>

34:00.230 --> 34:01.523
<i>That'll get us
toned and prepared</i>

34:01.606 --> 34:03.191
<i>for all manner of combat.</i>

34:05.277 --> 34:09.281
Not working out at all.

34:09.531 --> 34:11.158
Masking tape.

34:11.241 --> 34:13.577
It is no friend
to chilled aluminum.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.621
Velcro.
Color-coded, efficient,

34:16.705 --> 34:17.789
environmentally friendly.

34:18.540 --> 34:20.083
Who is he talking to?

34:20.167 --> 34:21.867
And why is he dressed like
a registered sex offender?

34:21.877 --> 34:23.837
Can we focus
for a moment, ladies?

34:23.920 --> 34:26.172
Please, we need to talk about
next month's meal plan.

34:26.255 --> 34:28.007
Obviously,
everyone hated the ceviche.

34:28.091 --> 34:29.384
I read the suggestion box.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.052
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

34:31.136 --> 34:32.929
I see through this weak act.

34:33.179 --> 34:37.391
You may have fooled Colossus
with this nice guy shit...

34:37.559 --> 34:38.726
but not me.

34:38.810 --> 34:39.853
Don't be mean.

34:39.936 --> 34:41.228
Back Off, NTW.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.482
No, no, no.
Let her go.

34:43.565 --> 34:44.690
Let her go, it's okay.

34:44.774 --> 34:46.318
She has a right
to be skeptical.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.029
Look at me.
I'm an easy target.

34:50.197 --> 34:51.531
You know, historically,

34:51.614 --> 34:53.492
mischief has been
my mistress...

34:53.574 --> 34:56.244
so I understand, you know.
But I like to think...

34:57.871 --> 34:59.831
that you guys have
really rubbed off on me.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.288
I like to think that I've
rubbed off around you, too.

35:05.253 --> 35:06.254
A lot.

35:07.255 --> 35:09.883
And for the first time
in a long while...

35:09.966 --> 35:11.134
I like me.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.845
- I accept your apology.
- I never apologized.

35:15.931 --> 35:17.432
I was talking to your heart.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.893
See? You're not
lost cause you thought.

35:19.976 --> 35:23.146
I'm proud. You're everything
I knew you can be.

35:23.230 --> 35:24.523
Thank you, Colossus.

35:25.273 --> 35:26.873
Just trying to be
the world's best X-Man.

35:26.942 --> 35:28.360
Sorry, X-Person.

35:29.945 --> 35:32.572
Hmm. Something wrong
with the soap.

35:32.656 --> 35:34.241
It's fine.

35:34.324 --> 35:36.535
I just filled it. Give it
a few more pumps there.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.205
Now, if you'll excuse me...

35:40.288 --> 35:42.040
it's dust bunny season...

35:42.123 --> 35:43.124
and I'm hunting wabbits.

35:43.833 --> 35:44.960
Bye, Wade!

35:47.128 --> 35:49.673
Fuck.
Fuck you.

36:01.351 --> 36:03.895
<i>No one is born perfect.</i>

36:03.979 --> 36:05.939
But you can be.

36:06.022 --> 36:08.358
I know you're doing
what comes naturally.

36:12.654 --> 36:14.489
You can't help yourself.

36:18.368 --> 36:19.828
But you can.

36:20.495 --> 36:23.164
It takes work, discipline...

36:23.623 --> 36:24.833
and treatment.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.585
Your abilities...

36:28.545 --> 36:30.547
I know how seductive they are.

36:31.381 --> 36:33.550
How powerful
they make you feel.

36:34.551 --> 36:37.053
But you must learn
never to use them...

36:37.137 --> 36:39.723
so they will never use you.

36:45.979 --> 36:47.564
Please don't cry.

36:48.398 --> 36:49.983
I'm going to help.

36:50.066 --> 36:52.902
I'm gonna make you feel
what you should feel.

36:53.278 --> 36:54.696
How you need to feel...

36:55.822 --> 36:58.366
every time you're tempted
to act upon your urges.

36:59.242 --> 37:03.163
Suck my mutant dick,
you four-eyed fuck.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.845
<i>Wade.</i>

37:19.763 --> 37:20.764
Wade!

37:21.389 --> 37:23.433
Come in!
Hey, I was just doing

37:23.516 --> 37:25.060
a little bit
of light reading here...

37:25.477 --> 37:26.811
We have mission.

37:26.936 --> 37:28.438
Well, you guys be
safe out there.

37:28.521 --> 37:29.731
I'll be praying for you.

37:29.814 --> 37:32.233
No, I want you to join.

37:33.443 --> 37:34.569
I'm sorry, what?

37:34.653 --> 37:36.237
You heard me.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.573
Trust me,
that's a terrible idea.

37:38.740 --> 37:39.783
I'm really not ready.

37:39.866 --> 37:41.368
- You are ready.
- I'm not.

37:41.618 --> 37:43.370
Be at the X-Jet in five.

37:43.536 --> 37:44.663
I can do thirty.

37:44.746 --> 37:46.646
- Now.
- I can do now.

37:46.748 --> 37:47.791
Final offer.

37:48.041 --> 37:50.543
<i>Irene Merryweather,
WHIT News.</i>

37:50.627 --> 37:52.587
<i>Live here
at a breaking news situation</i>

37:52.671 --> 37:55.298
<i>at the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation.</i>

37:55.382 --> 37:57.300
A mutant boy
is appearing to have

37:57.384 --> 37:58.593
some sort of an incident...

37:58.677 --> 38:00.418
- with police here behind me.
- Get away from me!

38:00.428 --> 38:02.778
There are two police vehicles
that are overturned.

38:02.790 --> 38:04.390
- There are open fires.
- Fuck off! Stay back!

38:04.392 --> 38:05.472
A scene of
absolute chaos here.

38:05.475 --> 38:06.476
Calm down.

38:06.559 --> 38:09.270
I'll burn you!
You stay back!

38:09.979 --> 38:11.731
Get away from me!

38:11.815 --> 38:14.317
You wanna fucking die?

38:29.332 --> 38:32.502
And it appears as if the X-Men
are arriving...

38:32.585 --> 38:33.586
Scatter!

38:34.170 --> 38:36.131
...with what appears
to be a trainee.

38:36.214 --> 38:39.175
Everyone, calm down!
The pros are here. I...

38:39.259 --> 38:40.343
We're the X-Men!

38:40.427 --> 38:42.637
A dated metaphor for racism
in the '60s.

38:43.054 --> 38:45.223
So, respect.

38:45.598 --> 38:46.850
At ease, Officer.

38:48.435 --> 38:49.978
What are you doing?

38:50.437 --> 38:51.688
My job!

38:51.771 --> 38:53.171
You're the one who said
I was ready,

38:53.231 --> 38:54.691
and I frankly disagreed
with you.

38:54.774 --> 38:57.152
But here we are, trying to
overcome our differences.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.654
Like Beyoncé says, "Please...

39:00.488 --> 39:01.823
"Please, stop cheating on me."

39:01.906 --> 39:02.991
Hey!

39:03.074 --> 39:04.409
This is the fifth incident.

39:04.492 --> 39:06.661
This kid needs to be
in the Ice Box, not here.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.371
Russell belongs in our care.

39:08.455 --> 39:10.206
Not in prison.
I assure you...

39:10.290 --> 39:11.448
we have everything
under control.

39:11.458 --> 39:12.500
Stay back!
I'll burn you!

39:12.584 --> 39:13.752
Not getting a real

39:13.835 --> 39:15.503
"under control"
vibe here, Marty.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.964
- It is Glen, isn't it?
- Daniel.

39:18.047 --> 39:19.257
I'll ask the questions,
Miguel.

39:19.340 --> 39:20.633
Let me talk to the kid.

39:20.717 --> 39:25.555
You stay here with your weird,
secret sex lips.

39:27.307 --> 39:28.308
You wanna die?

39:28.391 --> 39:29.392
This kid's adorable.

39:29.476 --> 39:30.633
I don't know why I packed
the hollow points.

39:30.643 --> 39:31.770
I'll burn your balls off!

39:31.853 --> 39:34.481
First day.
I'm so nervous!

39:35.273 --> 39:36.775
Did you just say
"hollow points"?

39:36.858 --> 39:38.193
Yeah, probably should've

39:38.276 --> 39:40.320
brought a Super Soaker.

39:40.862 --> 39:41.863
Hi, there!

39:43.156 --> 39:45.617
Stay back
or Justin Bieber dies!

39:45.700 --> 39:49.204
Justin Bieber.
He called you Justin Bieber.

39:50.580 --> 39:52.207
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

39:52.290 --> 39:55.376
Okay, let's not do
whatever that is.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.920
Okay? Let's just talk!

39:57.003 --> 39:58.253
It's Russell, right?

39:58.671 --> 40:00.501
- Firefist.
- Firefist.

40:00.965 --> 40:03.176
Ooh, that's a great name.
Where does it burn?

40:03.259 --> 40:05.059
Just the fist, or all the way
up to the elbow?

40:09.724 --> 40:12.352
Definitely all
the way up to the elbow.

40:12.435 --> 40:14.437
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

40:15.313 --> 40:17.649
- You stole that from Robocop!
- That's from Robocop!

40:18.149 --> 40:19.734
Just stand down!

40:19.818 --> 40:21.861
You're embarrassing me.
Look, Fire.

40:23.279 --> 40:25.573
Oh, my God! I can't say it!
I'm so sorry!

40:30.328 --> 40:33.873
Oh, shit!
That fucking does it!

40:34.374 --> 40:35.708
Put your hands
behind your knees

40:35.792 --> 40:37.252
and get down
on your head! Now!

40:37.335 --> 40:39.546
Wade! What was first rule?

40:39.629 --> 40:41.548
Label everything
in the refrigerator!

40:41.631 --> 40:44.181
- Do not escalate!
- Rules are meant to be broken!

40:44.300 --> 40:45.677
That's the exact opposite

40:45.760 --> 40:47.136
of what they're meant for!

40:48.137 --> 40:49.597
Fuck! Fine!

40:50.139 --> 40:51.339
I'll start from the beginning.

40:51.808 --> 40:54.143
My name is Deadpool,
and I'm an X-Man.

40:54.227 --> 40:56.187
- Trainee!
- Shut it!

40:57.105 --> 40:59.399
Look, I get it.

41:00.567 --> 41:02.193
All right, you're scared.

41:02.735 --> 41:03.778
Alone.

41:03.862 --> 41:04.904
You got no family.

41:04.988 --> 41:06.062
I didn't have
a family, either.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.782
You live in this dump.
Guess what?

41:07.866 --> 41:09.576
I used to live in a shithole
just like it.

41:10.493 --> 41:11.786
But you know something?

41:11.870 --> 41:13.580
A wise woman
once said to me...

41:13.663 --> 41:15.039
"Speak up.

41:15.123 --> 41:17.333
"I can't hear you with that
pity dick in your mouth."

41:18.042 --> 41:19.627
Too much? I went too far.

41:27.635 --> 41:29.137
That was effervescent.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.139
Stay in school, kid.

41:31.514 --> 41:33.016
Or don't. I didn't.

41:33.391 --> 41:34.934
And I'm an X-Man.

41:35.018 --> 41:36.102
Trainee.

41:36.185 --> 41:37.520
Fuck it!

41:37.604 --> 41:39.355
Superhero landing coming up!

41:42.942 --> 41:44.569
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

41:44.652 --> 41:46.487
That is so not practical.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.260
I could get used
to this X-Man shit.

42:09.344 --> 42:10.345
Trainee!

42:10.428 --> 42:11.471
Trainee!

42:12.096 --> 42:13.598
Get a power restraint
on him. Now!

42:13.681 --> 42:16.893
Calm down, squirt.
It's over. We got ya.

42:18.770 --> 42:20.271
What's that do?

42:20.355 --> 42:21.814
Power-dampening collar.

42:21.898 --> 42:23.149
Shuts down
all mutant abilities.

42:23.274 --> 42:26.027
You can't get it off.
Unless you've got a grenade.

42:26.110 --> 42:29.072
Huh. Could've used
one of those in the first act.

42:29.155 --> 42:30.406
Thank you!

42:32.241 --> 42:34.452
That was absolutely thrilling.

42:34.535 --> 42:36.537
True heroism in action.

42:36.788 --> 42:38.456
We are in your debt.

42:39.248 --> 42:40.875
We can take it from here.

42:40.959 --> 42:43.127
Take me
to the Ice Box, please!

42:43.211 --> 42:44.379
Anywhere's better than here.

42:44.462 --> 42:45.672
Believe me, son,

42:45.755 --> 42:47.465
you do not wanna go
to the Ice Box.

42:47.548 --> 42:50.051
That place makes Hitler's anus
look like Waikiki.

42:50.176 --> 42:52.011
Let's get you inside,
young man.

42:52.095 --> 42:54.055
No, wait, wait. Wait.

42:54.138 --> 42:55.640
You guys stay there.

43:05.733 --> 43:07.360
Those guys hurt you?

43:08.778 --> 43:09.821
Who?

43:11.864 --> 43:14.575
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

43:16.035 --> 43:17.537
Both of 'em?

43:21.249 --> 43:22.917
Oh, fuck it.

43:23.001 --> 43:24.544
Four or five moments!

43:24.627 --> 43:25.628
I'm sorry?

43:25.712 --> 43:28.881
Four or five moments!

43:30.133 --> 43:32.885
That's all it takes
to be a hero.

43:33.928 --> 43:35.930
People think
you wake up a hero...

43:36.264 --> 43:37.890
brush your teeth a hero...

43:38.474 --> 43:40.977
ejaculate into
a soap dispenser a hero.

43:42.770 --> 43:46.524
But, no, being a hero
takes only a few moments!

43:47.859 --> 43:49.485
A few moments...

43:49.569 --> 43:52.196
doing the ugly stuff
no one else will do.

43:55.742 --> 43:56.868
No!

43:59.537 --> 44:00.747
Stand down!
Hold your fire!

44:00.830 --> 44:03.130
- Wade, what did you do?
- Colossus, no!

44:03.207 --> 44:06.461
You were right, Wade.
You are not X-Men material.

44:06.544 --> 44:08.796
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

44:08.880 --> 44:10.339
What was your first clue?

44:10.423 --> 44:13.217
The hollow point
through that fuckhead's face?

44:13.593 --> 44:14.844
That kid was abused!

44:14.927 --> 44:16.721
- You can always tell!
- We have rules!

44:17.013 --> 44:19.724
You are not judge,
jury or executioner!

44:19.807 --> 44:22.727
Fuck your rules!
I fight for what's right!

44:22.810 --> 44:24.395
And sometimes
you gotta fight dirty!

44:24.687 --> 44:27.732
You let me down
for the last time, Wade.

44:30.860 --> 44:33.112
Okay,
get these guys in the pod.

44:33.196 --> 44:35.364
Take them to the Ice Box.

44:56.010 --> 44:57.011
Hey, baby!

44:58.096 --> 45:00.306
I wonder what gang
I'll be in.

45:00.389 --> 45:01.766
Yeah!

45:01.933 --> 45:04.185
- Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?
- Hi.

45:06.062 --> 45:07.438
I've always seen myself as

45:07.522 --> 45:08.898
more of
an East Coast Hufflepuff.

45:10.399 --> 45:13.361
I've made a critical error
on my Airbnb reservation.

45:13.444 --> 45:17.281
This is not what the website
looked like at all.

45:18.866 --> 45:20.576
I love the decor though.

45:20.660 --> 45:22.578
I had no idea
hopeless was a color.

45:22.662 --> 45:23.913
Hard left, douchebag.

45:28.417 --> 45:29.585
Please, after you.

45:31.796 --> 45:34.465
Another disgusting minority
off the streets.

45:34.549 --> 45:35.633
We'll sleep well tonight.

45:35.716 --> 45:36.717
Let's get a bagel.

45:40.012 --> 45:42.849
Nighty-night,
you annoying prick!

46:18.634 --> 46:20.469
You're a long way
from your superpowers.

46:20.553 --> 46:22.930
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

46:23.014 --> 46:25.474
Not to worry,
we're old friends.

46:25.558 --> 46:26.726
Fuck!

46:26.809 --> 46:28.477
I wanted to be a superhero.

46:29.020 --> 46:30.938
Always wanted
a real super suit.

46:31.022 --> 46:32.565
What happened?

46:32.648 --> 46:34.768
When was the last time you saw
a plus-sized superhero?

46:35.401 --> 46:36.569
Never.

46:36.944 --> 46:38.738
The industry discriminates.

46:39.822 --> 46:41.365
Fuck superheroes.

46:41.949 --> 46:44.160
The thing that
pisses me off the most...

46:44.243 --> 46:46.078
I never stood up
for myself in there.

46:47.705 --> 46:49.498
My whole life.

46:50.666 --> 46:54.128
I've been waiting for someone
to come and save me.

46:56.547 --> 46:59.508
Nobody's gonna sacrifice
anything for me.

47:03.638 --> 47:05.890
I gotta start taking care
of myself.

47:07.225 --> 47:09.060
I have a mission now.

47:10.019 --> 47:12.647
The first thing I wanna do
when I get out of here...

47:12.730 --> 47:15.024
burn the headmaster alive...

47:15.107 --> 47:17.693
and then take a selfie
with his smoldering corpse.

47:18.861 --> 47:21.280
Aw. That's, like,
my favorite part of the Bible.

47:23.032 --> 47:24.951
I don't have
a sock puppet on me...

47:25.576 --> 47:27.036
but what did he do to you?

47:27.662 --> 47:29.205
Did he taste the rainbow?

47:29.288 --> 47:31.332
I'd whisper it,
but Skittles would sue us.

47:32.500 --> 47:34.126
Fucker hates mutants.

47:34.585 --> 47:36.462
He tried to beat
the genes out of us.

47:36.545 --> 47:39.090
Nothing worse than a "pray
the gay away" type guy.

47:39.882 --> 47:41.259
Sick piece of shit.

47:42.677 --> 47:46.347
Tomorrow, we'll find
the biggest guy in here...

47:47.306 --> 47:48.975
and we'll make him our bitch!

47:52.937 --> 47:54.230
What was that?

47:54.313 --> 47:56.274
That is the biggest guy
in here.

47:56.941 --> 47:58.985
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

47:59.068 --> 48:00.861
though no one's ever seen it,

48:00.945 --> 48:03.114
they keep a monster
in the basement.

48:03.197 --> 48:04.907
Right next to a huge,

48:04.991 --> 48:06.534
steaming bowl
of foreshadowing.

48:07.159 --> 48:08.160
Look.

48:09.161 --> 48:11.080
I can't protect you.

48:11.455 --> 48:12.581
With this collar on,

48:12.665 --> 48:15.751
my superpower
is just unbridled cancer.

48:15.835 --> 48:18.713
Give me a bow and arrow,
I'm basically Hawkeye.

48:19.338 --> 48:21.382
Now, if you'll excuse me...

48:21.465 --> 48:24.635
I've got tumors to grow.
Vanessa awaits.

48:24.719 --> 48:26.971
I'll start by making us
a shank.

48:27.221 --> 48:29.121
- Good listening.
- I stole that guard's pen...

48:29.181 --> 48:31.100
and stashed it
in the old prison wallet,

48:31.183 --> 48:32.560
if you know what I'm saying.

48:32.643 --> 48:35.104
I really hope I don't know
what you're saying.

48:37.189 --> 48:39.483
I know it's in there,
I just need to get it out.

48:39.567 --> 48:41.485
Oh, Jesus Christ.

48:41.736 --> 48:43.988
I can hear you
rummaging around in there.

48:44.405 --> 48:46.532
Do they make Purell
for your ears?

48:51.329 --> 48:52.663
<i>And to update you</i>

48:52.747 --> 48:54.081
<i>on the story reported earlier,</i>

48:54.165 --> 48:55.708
<i>after a lengthy standoff</i>

48:55.791 --> 48:58.461

48:58.544 --> 48:59.837

<i>...several

49:08.971 --> 49:10.973

49:43.714 --> 49:45.091
Psst!

49:47.385 --> 49:49.220
Don't do that.

49:49.804 --> 49:52.640
What? Why are you
winking at me?

49:56.268 --> 49:57.645
I got your back.

49:57.728 --> 49:58.896
Oh, my God.

49:58.979 --> 50:00.439
You're sick,
I gotta protect you.

50:00.523 --> 50:02.441
Just leave me alone, kid.

50:03.567 --> 50:04.652
Oh, great.

50:06.487 --> 50:08.989
Well, hello there, new fish.

50:09.073 --> 50:11.992
It's nice to see some
fresh faces around here.

50:12.159 --> 50:14.370
I've done some
light catalog work...

50:14.453 --> 50:16.913
but, really, modeling is just
a stepping stone to acting.

50:16.997 --> 50:18.947
- I was talking to him.
- Oh.

50:19.834 --> 50:22.837
Have we met?
I can't place your mustache.

50:23.254 --> 50:25.874
- Black Tom Cassidy.
- White Wade Wilson.

50:25.965 --> 50:29.093
What's your superpower?
Cultural appropriation?

50:29.427 --> 50:31.971
You're supposed to be
the toughest cunt in here.

50:32.054 --> 50:33.722
You don't look
like much to me.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.059
First rule of the yard,
fuckface...

50:37.143 --> 50:38.743
find the biggest guy
and make him your...

50:43.023 --> 50:45.192
Second biggest guy.

50:45.276 --> 50:47.528
The last thing I need
is more hepatitis.

50:47.778 --> 50:51.282
Oh, it's slippery, too.
This table needs a wipe down!

50:51.365 --> 50:52.765
Can we get a wipe down
on the table?

50:54.493 --> 50:56.120
Kid, I think you picked
the wrong side.

50:56.787 --> 50:59.081
No, I didn't!
He's my friend!

50:59.165 --> 51:01.417
Zip it. We're not friends.

51:03.127 --> 51:04.407
You're about to get
dick-slapped.

51:16.765 --> 51:18.476
I had so much fun!
You were like...

51:18.559 --> 51:20.603
And I was like,
"Take a seat, shit dick."

51:20.686 --> 51:21.812
Just let me die in peace.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.231
We make a great team!

51:24.648 --> 51:27.193
Oh, God! We're not a team.

51:27.276 --> 51:31.572
Why'd you say that back there?
We're friends, partners.

51:31.655 --> 51:34.074
We're not partners
or friends.

51:35.493 --> 51:37.536
This doesn't end with us
riding into the sunset.

51:37.620 --> 51:39.788
It ends with me
dying of cancer...

51:39.872 --> 51:43.417
and you winning the Ice Box
award for softest mouth.

51:45.169 --> 51:46.712
There's only one person
in this world

51:46.795 --> 51:48.589
that I care about,
and she's gone.

51:50.382 --> 51:52.384
You wanna survive?

51:53.594 --> 51:56.889
Stop trying to shank
the biggest guys in here...

51:56.972 --> 51:58.849
and make friends with them.

52:00.142 --> 52:01.727
Make friends with someone.

52:02.978 --> 52:04.563
Anyone but me.

52:05.731 --> 52:08.067
Maybe even Black Tim.

52:08.984 --> 52:10.528
Black Evan, I don't know.

52:10.611 --> 52:13.113
All I remember is
he was African-American.

52:58.576 --> 53:00.619
<i>System malfunctioning.</i>

53:00.703 --> 53:04.039
<i>Cells 7,12,14,27.</i>

53:04.123 --> 53:06.333
Back in your cells, you filthy
mutants! Get in there!

53:06.417 --> 53:09.712
<i>Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.</i>

53:10.921 --> 53:12.298
Searching.

53:13.841 --> 53:16.218
<i>Cell 04 located.</i>

53:17.595 --> 53:19.221
Door won't open!

53:19.763 --> 53:21.390
On your fucking knees!

53:58.344 --> 54:00.054
That was our cell.

54:02.181 --> 54:04.433
What did I do to piss off
a grumpy old fucker

54:04.516 --> 54:05.684
with a Winter Soldier arm?

54:14.943 --> 54:16.862
Get away from me, kid!

54:24.495 --> 54:25.704
Listen to me! Go!

54:31.210 --> 54:32.503
Hello, Russell.

55:55.919 --> 55:57.963
I don't bargain.

56:16.106 --> 56:17.107
Who are you?

56:17.983 --> 56:19.234
I'm Batman.

56:30.662 --> 56:31.705
Ooh!

56:36.460 --> 56:39.338
Oh. That's got some zip.

56:47.846 --> 56:50.641
Don't feel bad.
Even I can't kill me.

56:51.350 --> 56:52.392
Talk!

56:52.935 --> 56:54.686
What kind of
spineless shit stick

56:54.770 --> 56:56.146
tries to kill
a 14-year-old boy?

56:57.439 --> 56:58.639
You might wanna start talking!

56:58.690 --> 57:01.109
'Cause I got a long history of
firing at times like this!

57:02.611 --> 57:04.112
The name's Cable.

57:04.655 --> 57:07.324
I'm from the future.
Just walk away.

57:07.991 --> 57:09.284
Oh!

57:09.368 --> 57:10.828
So, you're from the future.

57:11.370 --> 57:13.205
I have
three questions then.

57:13.372 --> 57:16.542
One, is dubstep still a thing?

57:17.000 --> 57:19.461
Two, do people still homebrew?

57:19.545 --> 57:22.130
And three,
does Dopinder ever find love?

58:06.300 --> 58:08.010
Dubstep's for pussies.

58:08.093 --> 58:09.261
You're so dark!

58:09.344 --> 58:11.555
Are you sure you're not
from the DC universe?

58:12.306 --> 58:13.807
I love dubstep!

58:40.125 --> 58:41.543
Is that a fanny pack?

58:41.627 --> 58:44.212
I used to have one of those
in 1990-never.

58:45.172 --> 58:47.257
Something to remember you by.

58:47.341 --> 58:51.053
Give me that back!
That goes with me everywhere.

58:51.136 --> 58:53.513
Like the memory
of your fucking fanny pack!

59:03.231 --> 59:05.317
Why are you protecting
the kid?

59:06.652 --> 59:08.570
I don't give a fuck
about him...

59:08.987 --> 59:11.406
<i>and his Are You My Mother?
complex!</i>

59:13.742 --> 59:14.993
What's this one do?

59:29.174 --> 59:30.759
<i>In every film,
there's</i> a <i>moment</i>

59:30.842 --> 59:33.178
<i>when the hero
hits rock bottom.</i>

59:33.261 --> 59:35.180
<i>In "Cool Runnings",
it was when John Candy's</i>

59:35.263 --> 59:36.556
<i>prized bobsled broke.</i>

59:37.265 --> 59:39.977
<i>In "Human Centipede",
it was when those people...</i>

59:40.060 --> 59:41.603
<i>signed on to be in that movie.</i>

59:41.687 --> 59:43.146
<i>But in this film, well...</i>

59:43.855 --> 59:45.023
<i>you're looking at it.</i>

59:45.107 --> 59:46.858
On your fucking knees, mutant.

59:49.778 --> 59:50.779
<i>Rock...</i>

59:54.825 --> 59:56.326
<i>meet bottom.</i>

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:08.088
<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.381
Ness?

01:00:10.424 --> 01:00:11.883
Hey, Ness!

01:00:12.759 --> 01:00:14.553
Ness, can you let me in?

01:00:14.636 --> 01:00:16.722
Please! Please.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:19.975
Jesus.

01:00:22.936 --> 01:00:24.696
You're not giving me
a lot of direction here.

01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:26.523
I'm at the end of my rope.

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:31.278
Then I joined the X-Men.

01:00:31.445 --> 01:00:33.280
I went to prison. I, uh...

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.869
Is it the kid?

01:00:40.912 --> 01:00:43.832
Kids give us a chance to be
better than we used to be.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.251
The kid!

01:01:00.307 --> 01:01:01.600
That's exactly what she meant.

01:01:01.683 --> 01:01:02.966
Your heart needs to be
in the right place.

01:01:02.976 --> 01:01:04.811
I'm not gonna
abandon this kid.

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:07.481
He's never had anyone, ever.

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:08.857
I need to be selfless.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.859
Yeah, but what does
that mean?

01:01:10.942 --> 01:01:14.071
It means
I'm gonna save Russell.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.739
Maybe I couldn't
save Vanessa...

01:01:15.822 --> 01:01:18.784
but maybe I can save a robust
teenager from New Zealand.

01:01:18.867 --> 01:01:20.942
Yeah, but what I mean is,
like, the world "selfless."

01:01:20.952 --> 01:01:22.472
I literally don't know
what that means.

01:01:22.537 --> 01:01:23.663
Jesus Christ.

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:26.458
Okay, look.
According to my guy, okay...

01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:28.293
those muties
are being transferred

01:01:28.376 --> 01:01:30.170
to a supermax, 80 miles away.

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:32.047
Great, I'll pick 'em off
along the way.

01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:34.257
Hold your testicles there,
buddy, okay?

01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:36.301
We're talking about
an armored convoy...

01:01:36.384 --> 01:01:38.970
and a vicious super soldier
from the future...

01:01:39.054 --> 01:01:41.389
that is looking to turn your
skull into a fuckable ashtray.

01:01:41.473 --> 01:01:42.891
You know what we need to do?

01:01:42.974 --> 01:01:44.726
We need to build
a fucking team.

01:01:44.893 --> 01:01:46.937
We need 'em tough,
morally flexible...

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.396
and young enough
so they can carry

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.679
this franchise 10 to 12 years.

01:01:49.689 --> 01:01:51.525
A team of
highly-skilled motherfuckers.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:54.611
I'm talking about some
<i>Ocean's 14</i> shit. <i>Rogue Two.</i>

01:01:54.694 --> 01:01:57.072
<i>John Wick 3,</i> but with
the original director.

01:01:57.155 --> 01:01:59.032
My body is an
instrument of death.

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:00.450
Not now, Dopinder.

01:02:00.534 --> 01:02:01.952
I could be of great use.

01:02:02.035 --> 01:02:03.620
What's your superpower?

01:02:05.413 --> 01:02:07.033
- Courage.
- That's adorable.

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:08.804
Do you have the courage
to check and see...

01:02:08.834 --> 01:02:11.169
if there are enough sanitary
napkins in the dispenser?

01:02:11.253 --> 01:02:12.254
Yes, sir.

01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:13.588
I'm sorry
you had to see that,

01:02:13.672 --> 01:02:15.173
although I'm glad
you heard it.

01:02:16.049 --> 01:02:17.926
All right, I'll put out
a call for resumes.

01:02:18.009 --> 01:02:20.220
But we're not paying
medical or dental.

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:22.347
It's time to get back
on LinkedIn.

01:02:59.217 --> 01:03:00.760
<i>Attention, all inmates!</i>

01:03:00.927 --> 01:03:03.305
<i>Transport to Cross Force
Maximum Security</i>

01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:04.764
<i>Mutant Containment Facility...</i>

01:03:04.931 --> 01:03:06.766
<i>will begin at 0800 hours.</i>

01:03:06.933 --> 01:03:08.894
<i>Inspection of your cells
and out processing</i>

01:03:08.977 --> 01:03:11.021
<i>will begin at 0600.</i>

01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:20.322
Oi.

01:03:20.447 --> 01:03:21.781
What the fuck
do you want?

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:23.658
That's my fucking pudding.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.300
- Fuck your pudding!
- You like pudding?

01:03:46.765 --> 01:03:47.766
Hello?

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.395
I know you're in there.

01:04:08.078 --> 01:04:10.372
Must be hard
being the biggest guy in here.

01:04:11.665 --> 01:04:13.917
Lonely at the top, eh?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.961
They're moving us tomorrow.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.215
Maybe I can get you
out of here.

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:24.594
And we can make
the whole world our bitch.

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:28.181
We need a secret code.

01:04:31.226 --> 01:04:33.853
No,
that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:42.612
We're a team.

01:04:42.696 --> 01:04:44.614
We're like thugs,
we're like gangsters.

01:04:44.698 --> 01:04:46.658
I'm like Tupac,
and you're like Ice Cube.

01:04:48.368 --> 01:04:49.484
Supposedly,
she can rap, too.

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:50.578
Yeah.

01:04:50.662 --> 01:04:51.663
I like that.

01:04:51.746 --> 01:04:53.164
Terrific,
these are all terrific.

01:04:53.415 --> 01:04:55.125
Meet Bedlam.

01:04:55.208 --> 01:04:57.377
Cool name! Superpowers?

01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:59.004
I can distort
electrical fields.

01:05:00.255 --> 01:05:02.424
Including the one
inside your brain...

01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:05.176
causing anxiety, confusion...

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.344
pain.

01:05:07.304 --> 01:05:09.347
So, basically,
you're Dave Matthews.

01:05:09.431 --> 01:05:10.598
We can use him.

01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:13.893
I'm Zeitgeist.

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.312
Cool. I like it.

01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:16.645
So you have the power

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:19.065
to put your finger
on the pulse of society?

01:05:20.108 --> 01:05:21.258
No.

01:05:21.318 --> 01:05:23.918
- No, I spit acidic vomit.
- Oh.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.520
- Do you want me to demonstrate?
- No!

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:27.130
- We'll take your word for it.
- Thank you. Yeah.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:29.240
Listen, we've all eaten
at Arby's, okay?

01:05:29.242 --> 01:05:31.870
And this is the Vanisher.

01:05:35.206 --> 01:05:36.207
But...

01:05:37.375 --> 01:05:38.835
Vanisher!

01:05:41.379 --> 01:05:43.049
- Nice!
- Right?

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:45.425
He's not here, is he?

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:47.052
He may be running late.

01:05:48.636 --> 01:05:51.097
My name's Rusty,
but I go by Shatterstar.

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:52.724
That's good, yeah.

01:05:52.807 --> 01:05:54.887
- "Rusty" is terrible.
- Toughie.

01:05:54.976 --> 01:05:57.687
- So, uh, where are you from?
- The planet Mojo World.

01:05:57.854 --> 01:05:59.854
- So you're an alien, I guess.
- Bad name.

01:05:59.939 --> 01:06:01.566
How does that, uh, help us?

01:06:01.649 --> 01:06:04.444
I'm basically better
than you at everything.

01:06:04.611 --> 01:06:06.331
Just once, I'm gonna find
a planet of people

01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:07.906
that are worse than me
at everything.

01:06:07.989 --> 01:06:10.158
A whole bunch
of functional idiots.

01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:12.192
I'm gonna go there, and I'm
gonna be their Superman.

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:13.286
Isn't that Canada?

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:15.789
You shut your
goddamn trash mouth!

01:06:16.956 --> 01:06:18.416
- Meet...
- Domino.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.210
- What's your shtick?
- I'm lucky.

01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:21.586
That's not a superpower.

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:23.045
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it isn't.

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:24.422
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

01:06:24.506 --> 01:06:25.506
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it isn't.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:26.591
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

01:06:26.674 --> 01:06:27.675
- Yeah, it is.
- Really isn't.

01:06:27.759 --> 01:06:28.839
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:30.011
Told you.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.429
Get out of my head!

01:06:31.596 --> 01:06:33.181
I'm not in your head.

01:06:33.264 --> 01:06:34.504
I'm in an
11-year-old's bedroom.

01:06:34.641 --> 01:06:35.767
Well, if you're so lucky,

01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:37.394
then what are you
doing here with us?

01:06:37.477 --> 01:06:38.561
I don't know yet.

01:06:38.645 --> 01:06:39.719
What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.513
There's a reason why I'm here,
and I'll know when I know.

01:06:41.523 --> 01:06:43.348
Everything usually
just kind of works out for me.

01:06:43.358 --> 01:06:45.193
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

01:06:46.486 --> 01:06:47.570
I don't know who that is.

01:06:47.654 --> 01:06:48.822
You're hired.

01:06:49.197 --> 01:06:50.198
Lucky me.

01:06:50.281 --> 01:06:51.491
I like her!

01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:53.910
And last, but not least...

01:06:53.993 --> 01:06:55.120
Peter.

01:06:56.496 --> 01:06:58.456
Am I getting
catfished here or...?

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:00.959
Any powers you wanna
tell us about?

01:07:01.042 --> 01:07:02.127
No.

01:07:02.669 --> 01:07:04.337
I don't have one.

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:05.713
Um, I just saw the ad.

01:07:05.797 --> 01:07:07.507
No superpowers at all?

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:10.718
Uh, I have both
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

01:07:11.219 --> 01:07:12.512
OW! Oh!

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:13.721
That's all the diabetes.

01:07:13.805 --> 01:07:15.056
Right?
Yeah, you got 'em all.

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.058
If you find a Type 3,
let us know.

01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:18.560
Yeah.

01:07:18.643 --> 01:07:19.727
You're in.

01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:21.311
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:25.108
It's fulfilling work.

01:07:30.196 --> 01:07:31.489
Let's go!

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:47.672
<i>This is Convoy 17
departing the Ice Box.</i>

01:07:47.755 --> 01:07:49.132
<i>We are en route.</i>

01:07:56.723 --> 01:07:59.100
Peacetime makes people soft.

01:08:00.685 --> 01:08:02.479
I was born into war.

01:08:04.022 --> 01:08:05.190
Bred into it.

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:07.317
Okay.

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:10.487
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

01:08:12.447 --> 01:08:13.656
These restraints are pretty...

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.158
People think
they understand pain.

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:17.076
They have no concept of it

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.120
beyond their own
worst experience.

01:08:20.705 --> 01:08:23.875
5 years old. That's what?

01:08:23.957 --> 01:08:25.460
A bee sting.

01:08:25.542 --> 01:08:26.627
Oh, yeah.

01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:29.214
20 years old, shrapnel.

01:08:29.296 --> 01:08:31.591
40 years old, disease.

01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:36.554
Maybe the kind that leaves you
more machine than man.

01:08:36.638 --> 01:08:38.037
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

01:08:38.096 --> 01:08:39.682
That's what my
Grandma Ginny used to...

01:08:39.765 --> 01:08:40.975
I've got a list.

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:43.685
We're gonna work down it.

01:08:44.395 --> 01:08:45.395
Together.

01:08:46.564 --> 01:08:48.691
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

01:08:49.651 --> 01:08:51.944
Something that was not
meant to bend.

01:08:52.028 --> 01:08:53.144
I'm gonna
stop you right there

01:08:53.154 --> 01:08:54.520
because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:55.823
I won't even
make it to one.

01:08:55.907 --> 01:08:57.575
I don't do well with pain,
you know.

01:08:57.658 --> 01:08:59.786
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

01:09:00.078 --> 01:09:02.080
<i>I cried when they
canceled Felicity.</i>

01:09:02.497 --> 01:09:04.363
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:05.707
I have one right now.

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:07.335
Don't look.
It'll only make it worse.

01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:08.497
I don't want you
to hurt me,

01:09:08.545 --> 01:09:10.796
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:13.383
Except for where they are.

01:09:13.966 --> 01:09:15.250
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.469
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:18.044
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:19.471
You all know the plan.

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:21.265
Intercept the convoy,

01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:23.309
grab the boy.
But not inappropriately!

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:24.394
<i>You know what,</i>

01:09:24.477 --> 01:09:25.635
<i>I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.</i>

01:09:25.645 --> 01:09:28.439
<i>Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.</i>

01:09:28.523 --> 01:09:31.192
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

01:09:31.276 --> 01:09:33.861
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

01:09:33.944 --> 01:09:37.073
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.908
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

01:09:40.368 --> 01:09:42.161
So if you go after
them, Cable, I warn you...

01:09:43.162 --> 01:09:44.747
there's a wind advisory
in effect.

01:09:56.092 --> 01:09:57.677
<i>A little turbulent up here.</i>

01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:06.853
I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.271
but I guarantee
he hasn't killed

01:10:08.354 --> 01:10:10.106
as many people
as melanoma has.

01:10:11.482 --> 01:10:12.567
We're getting close!

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.569
As a former X-Man...

01:10:14.652 --> 01:10:16.529
- Trainee.
- Thank you, Bedlam.

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:18.948
I was always appalled
by the blatant sexism

01:10:19.032 --> 01:10:20.575
in the group's name.

01:10:20.658 --> 01:10:22.660
X-Men! Men!

01:10:22.744 --> 01:10:25.705
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.081
Gender neutral.

01:10:27.165 --> 01:10:29.459
From now on,
we'll be known as...

01:10:31.711 --> 01:10:33.046
X-Force.

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:34.839
Isn't that
a little derivative?

01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:37.342
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

01:10:38.593 --> 01:10:40.053
That wasn't me.

01:10:47.101 --> 01:10:49.395
Hang the laundry out
at 1,300 feet...

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.272
intercept the convoy,
and grab the boy.

01:10:51.356 --> 01:10:52.472
Let's bring on
the carnage, baby!

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:54.317
Get me on the ground,
watch me go!

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.401
Yeah!

01:10:55.485 --> 01:10:57.236
I can't wait to kill!

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.988
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:11:00.114 --> 01:11:01.908
I just wanna say
how proud I am of this team.

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:05.662
You know,
you guys look amazing!

01:11:05.745 --> 01:11:08.581
Vanisher, I have no doubt
you look amazing too.

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:09.707
This is the family

01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:11.471
that I've always dreamed
of having and I...

01:11:12.293 --> 01:11:13.336
Ah, Shit.

01:11:14.962 --> 01:11:16.631
I just get a little choked up
sometimes.

01:11:16.714 --> 01:11:18.508
I hate to interrupt,
but is anybody nervous

01:11:18.591 --> 01:11:19.926
about the high winds?

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.302
- Gary.
- My name's Peter.

01:11:21.386 --> 01:11:23.262
I realize that you're
new to this, but relax.

01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:24.786
You've been chosen
by a higher power.

01:11:25.056 --> 01:11:27.306
- Did he just call himself God?
- I think he did.

01:11:27.392 --> 01:11:28.992
- I'd like to go home.
- And I'd like...

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:31.479
the McRib to be available
year round,

01:11:31.562 --> 01:11:33.356
but sometimes dreams
don't come true.

01:11:33.439 --> 01:11:35.566
I spent 10 years
in Special Forces.

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:36.808
You think we didn't
jump out of the plane

01:11:36.818 --> 01:11:38.194
because of a light breeze?

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.072
You're in this shit now,
Mustache!

01:11:41.155 --> 01:11:43.074
I'm only yelling
to impress the other guys.

01:11:43.157 --> 01:11:45.076
I'd never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:47.662
Leonard, hit it!

01:11:56.421 --> 01:11:58.464
Go! Go! Go!

01:12:34.167 --> 01:12:35.543
Let's get some!

01:12:35.626 --> 01:12:36.753
Whoo!

01:12:36.836 --> 01:12:37.962
Oh, yeah!

01:12:38.045 --> 01:12:40.882
Convoy, 12 o'clock!
On my command!

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:43.384
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

01:12:43.468 --> 01:12:44.719
Whoa!

01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:51.893
Little off course here.

01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:56.898
Holy mommy fucking shit!

01:12:57.648 --> 01:12:59.066
Ah, there they are.

01:12:59.150 --> 01:13:02.236
Look at these gorgeous
sons of bitches.

01:13:02.779 --> 01:13:04.697
Oh, yeah!
That's right, Bedlam!

01:13:09.786 --> 01:13:13.706
No! Tripping
motherfucking billies!

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:17.210
Shatterstar.
Okay, you got this.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.961
Left!

01:13:19.045 --> 01:13:20.379
Left!

01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:22.673
You'd have to be insane
to take off in this.

01:13:22.757 --> 01:13:24.967
No, stage left, you idiot!

01:13:28.888 --> 01:13:30.389
Well, I guess
we found something

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:31.557
you're not better at.

01:13:33.768 --> 01:13:35.061
Vanisher.

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.094
Maybe the wind can't blow
what it can't see.

01:13:40.024 --> 01:13:41.424
Really?

01:13:41.526 --> 01:13:43.319
All right,
we could do this with four.

01:13:43.903 --> 01:13:46.864
Sugarbear.
You got this, buddy!

01:13:46.948 --> 01:13:49.075
That's the stuff!
That's the X-Force spirit!

01:13:50.284 --> 01:13:52.328
Never underestimate
a man with a mustache!

01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:53.913
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.164
We did it!

01:13:55.248 --> 01:13:56.749
You're a goddamn
superhero, you!

01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:57.917
X-Force!

01:13:58.543 --> 01:13:59.627
X-Force.

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.883
Oh!

01:14:09.595 --> 01:14:10.595
Peter.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.680
I got you, buddy!

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.900
- You're gonna be fine!
- This is not good, man!

01:14:12.902 --> 01:14:15.530
You got this, big guy!
Here we go, Peter!

01:14:15.601 --> 01:14:17.019
Look at me.
We're X-Force, right?

01:14:17.103 --> 01:14:19.223
- Yeah, we're X-Force.
- We're X-Force.

01:14:23.276 --> 01:14:25.278
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?

01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:27.321
Fucking acidic vomit!

01:14:28.906 --> 01:14:31.659
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up
in my mask.

01:14:34.787 --> 01:14:37.164
Okay,
I'm over the convoy.

01:14:37.248 --> 01:14:39.083
Where did the rest
of the team land?

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:41.335
Good news and bad news.

01:14:41.419 --> 01:14:44.505
Bad news is
the whole team is dead.

01:14:44.589 --> 01:14:45.673
The good news is,

01:14:45.756 --> 01:14:47.717
I don't think anyone's
gonna miss Shatterstar.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.095
He was a bit of a prick.
Oh, but Paul!

01:14:51.178 --> 01:14:52.179
<i>Peter!</i>

01:14:52.263 --> 01:14:53.681
Peter, I'm gonna
miss him most.

01:14:53.764 --> 01:14:54.849
But there is
a slight chance

01:14:54.932 --> 01:14:56.267
Vanisher could make it.

01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:58.895
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

01:14:58.978 --> 01:15:00.146
<i>The whole team?</i>

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:02.023
Only the main ones.
We're still good.

01:15:02.106 --> 01:15:03.357
<i>Fuck, you are dumb.</i>

01:15:03.441 --> 01:15:05.026
Whoever planned this stunt's

01:15:05.109 --> 01:15:07.278
been smoking
a lot jazz cabbage.

01:15:07.361 --> 01:15:08.446
I'll tell you that much.

01:15:08.529 --> 01:15:10.156
<i>That's pretty obvious!</i>

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.949
Looking good, Vanisher.

01:15:21.792 --> 01:15:23.669
They're headed
into the tunnel.

01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.088
I'm that kid's only hope,

01:15:26.172 --> 01:15:28.049
so sit tight
and wait for my word.

01:15:28.799 --> 01:15:29.799
<i>Whatever.</i>

01:15:29.884 --> 01:15:31.125
<i>We're gonna lose 'em.
I'm dropping in.</i>

01:15:31.135 --> 01:15:34.055
<i>Uh, that's
a negative, sole survivor.</i>

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:36.641
<i>Luck is not a superpower!
We are so fucked!</i>

01:15:36.724 --> 01:15:39.769
No, we most certainly
are not fucked.

01:15:42.897 --> 01:15:45.524
<i>Seriously,
I don't get it!</i>

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:48.069
<i>What, you shoot luck lasers
out of your eyes?</i>

01:15:50.237 --> 01:15:52.031
<i>It's just
it's hard to picture.</i>

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:54.241
<i>And certainly
not very cinematic.</i>

01:15:56.911 --> 01:15:58.496
<i>I mean, luck?</i>

01:15:58.579 --> 01:16:01.082
<i>What coked out,
glass pipe-sucking</i>

01:16:01.165 --> 01:16:02.500
<i>freakshow comic book artist...</i>

01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:04.168
<i>came up
with that little chestnut?</i>

01:16:04.251 --> 01:16:06.545
<i>Probably a guy
who can't draw feet!</i>

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.893
<i>Once again, it all falls
on my shoulders.</i>

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:22.218
<i>It's why I'm cursed to be
a solo act.</i>

01:16:22.228 --> 01:16:23.268
- <i>Wander the Earth...</i>
- I'm in.

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:24.772
<i>I'm sorry, what did you say?</i>

01:16:24.855 --> 01:16:25.940
<i>I'm in.</i>

01:16:26.023 --> 01:16:27.900
How in the fuck
are you in already?

01:16:28.359 --> 01:16:29.610
Oh, shit.

01:16:30.194 --> 01:16:31.404
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:32.530
Okay.

01:16:32.613 --> 01:16:35.032
New plan. Use all of your
imaginary powers

01:16:35.116 --> 01:16:37.827
to stop Cable
from killing that kid.

01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:39.537
I'm coming up on your six.

01:16:47.795 --> 01:16:49.797
That gun is amazing!

01:16:58.973 --> 01:17:00.891
Hey!
Asshole!

01:17:01.058 --> 01:17:02.643
<i>Where is he?
I can't see him.</i>

01:17:02.727 --> 01:17:04.228
<i>He's on top of you.</i>

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.980
<i>He's tearing you open!</i>

01:17:06.439 --> 01:17:07.857
<i>He's going in
through the back!</i>

01:17:08.399 --> 01:17:09.483
<i>Oh, God, he's inside!</i>

01:17:09.567 --> 01:17:10.818
You hear yourself, right?

01:17:10.901 --> 01:17:12.319
<i>Accidental double entendres!</i>

01:17:12.403 --> 01:17:14.864
Russell! Russell Collins!

01:17:14.947 --> 01:17:16.866
Hands off that kid,
John Connor!

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:22.872
No, no, no!

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.335
Shit!

01:17:50.274 --> 01:17:52.193
Two can play that game!

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.155
Got it! No, I don't.

01:17:57.156 --> 01:17:58.157
<i>Showtime, mama!</i>

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.867
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

01:18:37.613 --> 01:18:39.522
I'd ask who you are, but
you'll be dead in a second.

01:18:39.532 --> 01:18:41.575
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

01:18:58.175 --> 01:18:59.176
Hang in there, Doms!

01:19:00.511 --> 01:19:02.138
Oh, this is really hard.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.818
And give me back
my Skee-Ball token.

01:19:19.363 --> 01:19:20.913
- You're doing great.
- X-Force.

01:19:22.867 --> 01:19:24.869
I guess dubstep never dies.

01:19:29.165 --> 01:19:30.207
Whoo!

01:19:37.089 --> 01:19:39.884
You killed Black Tom,
you racist son of a bitch!

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:43.804
That's unfortunate.

01:19:46.932 --> 01:19:48.184
We got no brakes!

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:49.602
Figure it out!

01:19:53.981 --> 01:19:55.524
There's nothing I can't kill.

01:19:58.319 --> 01:20:00.821
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin
used to say...

01:20:00.905 --> 01:20:03.240
"There's a first time
for everything, son."

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:06.535
Give me your best shot,
One-Eyed Willy.

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.302
Those bullets were, like,
super fast.

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:24.887
Here we go.

01:20:25.971 --> 01:20:28.182
Domino, mind slowing us down?

01:20:28.265 --> 01:20:30.351
Here goes nothing.

01:21:01.548 --> 01:21:03.300
Knock, knock.

01:21:09.848 --> 01:21:10.849
That's my boy.

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:18.440
Holy...

01:21:28.742 --> 01:21:30.327
<i>I'll be first to admit...</i>

01:21:30.411 --> 01:21:32.788
<i>this did not go
according to plan.</i>

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:35.666
<i>I'll also be the first
to admit that</i>

01:21:35.749 --> 01:21:37.584
<i>that plan was
written in crayon.</i>

01:21:37.668 --> 01:21:40.879
<i>Looks like Russell found
a new friend. Jelly.</i>

01:21:40.963 --> 01:21:42.506
<i>Turns out Domino's
a bit of a badass,</i>

01:21:42.589 --> 01:21:45.467
<i>and maybe,
possibly mildly lucky.</i>

01:21:45.551 --> 01:21:48.804
<i>But Cable? Ugh.
That guy's in a mood.</i>

01:21:48.887 --> 01:21:50.055
A mood that is

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:51.932
about to get
significantly worse.

01:22:15.706 --> 01:22:18.125
Something is so terribly,
terribly wrong.

01:22:21.086 --> 01:22:22.546
Oh.

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:25.966
Oh, God, that hurt.

01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:27.676
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

01:22:31.221 --> 01:22:32.306
Russell.

01:22:35.017 --> 01:22:36.101
Russell!

01:22:36.727 --> 01:22:38.812
Russ, where are ya?

01:22:42.441 --> 01:22:44.526
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:47.863
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God!

01:22:48.155 --> 01:22:49.365
Juggernaut!

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:52.701
I thought that was you!

01:22:52.785 --> 01:22:54.870
I should've worn
my white pants.

01:22:55.621 --> 01:22:58.621
You probably get this a lot,
but I am a huge fan.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:02.795
<i>Uncanny X-Men 183. Thor 411.</i>

01:23:02.878 --> 01:23:04.171
<i>X-Men Unlimited 12.</i>

01:23:04.254 --> 01:23:06.340
You know, it has always been
a dream of mine...

01:23:06.423 --> 01:23:08.175
to see my face
reflected in your helmet...

01:23:08.258 --> 01:23:10.427
as you charge at me
with murderous intent.

01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:12.012
I don't mean right now.

01:23:12.346 --> 01:23:14.223
I'm gonna rip you
in half now.

01:23:14.306 --> 01:23:16.642
That is such
a Juggernaut thing to say.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:24.733
Oh, my God!
I can't feel my legs.

01:23:24.817 --> 01:23:25.901
I can't feel...

01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:28.362
Oh, no, they're right here.

01:23:29.196 --> 01:23:30.948
Got 'em.
God, Russell.

01:23:31.031 --> 01:23:32.866
I have a mission.

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:34.535
To get my revenge.

01:23:35.035 --> 01:23:37.287
I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.

01:23:37.371 --> 01:23:39.540
You're not the revenge type.

01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:40.791
Take it from a friend.

01:23:41.208 --> 01:23:44.920
Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.

01:23:45.087 --> 01:23:47.214
You said it yourself.

01:23:47.297 --> 01:23:49.967
"I'm not your friend.
Find someone stronger."

01:23:50.050 --> 01:23:51.260
So I did.

01:23:53.011 --> 01:23:55.055
Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.

01:23:55.222 --> 01:23:58.684
But I can now. What do you
want me to say, huh?

01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:01.103
"I care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,

01:24:01.186 --> 01:24:03.021
I care about you, Russell.

01:24:03.647 --> 01:24:05.732
What's Juggernaut got
that I don't have?

01:24:05.816 --> 01:24:08.986
Don't you say legs!
I know you're gonna say legs!

01:24:09.528 --> 01:24:12.328
- Legs!
- Still hurts to hear out loud!

01:24:14.491 --> 01:24:17.411
What is that?
That's not a real rope!

01:24:17.494 --> 01:24:19.830
You get back here, young man!

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:21.915
Doms!

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:24.460
Doms, get me
out of here, please.

01:24:24.543 --> 01:24:26.962
Use my arms
as backpack straps.

01:24:29.673 --> 01:24:30.757
I think we may have found

01:24:30.841 --> 01:24:32.634
your cosmic reason
for being here.

01:24:33.051 --> 01:24:34.803
I'm pretty sure
this isn't it.

01:24:34.887 --> 01:24:36.138
X-Force.

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:51.445
<i>No child is hopeless.</i>

01:24:51.528 --> 01:24:54.328
- Don't give up on the boy.
- How could he just walk away?

01:24:55.073 --> 01:24:57.326
It was the coldness
in his eyes.

01:24:57.784 --> 01:24:59.369
You should've heard it.

01:25:01.288 --> 01:25:03.582
I guess family
really is an F-word.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.668
Rub my legs, Mama.

01:25:06.752 --> 01:25:08.128
Why would I
rub your legs?

01:25:08.212 --> 01:25:10.797
Please, they hurt.
I have growing pains.

01:25:14.259 --> 01:25:15.469
What in the...

01:25:15.969 --> 01:25:18.222
Why is your hand
so tiny again?

01:25:18.722 --> 01:25:20.098
That's not my hand.

01:25:20.599 --> 01:25:22.434
Oh! Mary,
mother of Joseph!

01:25:23.018 --> 01:25:24.895
That was nice for me.

01:25:24.978 --> 01:25:27.731
Wade! I heard what happened
with the convoy and...

01:25:32.236 --> 01:25:34.071
Why wouldn't you
cover that up?

01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:36.740
A warrior has nothing
to be ashamed of.

01:25:36.823 --> 01:25:38.742
Yeah, but you do.
Look at you.

01:25:38.825 --> 01:25:40.827
You're just
straight shirt-cocking it,

01:25:40.911 --> 01:25:42.329
toddler-style.

01:25:42.412 --> 01:25:44.331
Oh, yeah.
Full Winnie the Pooh.

01:25:44.414 --> 01:25:46.375
The hell's happening?
Describe it.

01:25:46.458 --> 01:25:47.741
I wouldn't ask him to do that,
if I were you.

01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:49.336
- It's like, um...
- Here we go.

01:25:49.419 --> 01:25:50.702
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.214
but they quit halfway through.

01:25:52.297 --> 01:25:53.455
They got the legs out,
and they said,

01:25:53.465 --> 01:25:54.800
"You know what, I'm done."

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:55.884
Happy?

01:25:55.968 --> 01:25:57.084
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

01:25:57.094 --> 01:25:58.428
But this time, you can see

01:25:58.512 --> 01:25:59.930
the Muppet's dick.

01:26:00.013 --> 01:26:01.213
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

01:26:01.223 --> 01:26:02.589
Mr. Weasel, I can
no longer be double-parked.

01:26:02.599 --> 01:26:04.268
I've had three tickets
already.

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:08.355
No, no, no, DP,
not again!

01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:10.232
This has happened before?

01:26:11.358 --> 01:26:12.776
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

01:26:12.859 --> 01:26:14.152
The indecision is killing me.

01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:16.113
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

01:26:17.698 --> 01:26:19.848
Oh. Wow!

01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:21.577
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:23.245
I'm talking about your face.

01:26:23.662 --> 01:26:25.462
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.800
- Jesus Christ!
- Looks like an avocado.

01:26:27.874 --> 01:26:29.501
Your legs, though,
they're cute.

01:26:29.835 --> 01:26:31.628
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

01:26:33.213 --> 01:26:34.756
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.134
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

01:26:37.593 --> 01:26:39.177
I'll tell you why I'm here.

01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:41.555
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband“.

01:26:41.638 --> 01:26:42.879
Beat me within
an inch of my life.

01:26:42.889 --> 01:26:44.141
He was torturing me!

01:26:44.224 --> 01:26:47.144
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

01:26:47.227 --> 01:26:49.396
So, I'm here
to help us gear up.

01:26:49.896 --> 01:26:51.096
So we can go after him
without me.

01:26:51.106 --> 01:26:52.106
No!

01:26:52.524 --> 01:26:53.859
I'm doing this alone.

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:56.312
- The Juggernaut will kill you all.
- Fair enough.

01:26:56.314 --> 01:26:58.414
I just need a couple of hours
to get some legs under me.

01:26:58.488 --> 01:26:59.573
What will you do?

01:26:59.656 --> 01:27:01.026
I don't care
what the kid did to me.

01:27:01.033 --> 01:27:02.326
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

01:27:02.409 --> 01:27:03.775
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.787
It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.

01:27:05.871 --> 01:27:07.623
Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.

01:27:07.706 --> 01:27:08.780
The first order
of business is

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:09.948
to get me in front of Cable...

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.658
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

01:27:11.668 --> 01:27:14.004
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

01:27:14.087 --> 01:27:15.839
Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...

01:27:15.922 --> 01:27:19.009
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

01:27:20.594 --> 01:27:22.194
He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?

01:27:30.854 --> 01:27:32.606
What in the ass?

01:27:32.898 --> 01:27:35.984
Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

01:27:36.276 --> 01:27:38.820
You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

01:27:39.363 --> 01:27:41.907
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:46.828
No. It's his
"Basic Instinct."

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:48.038
What can we help you with?

01:27:48.747 --> 01:27:50.415
I'm here to proposition you.

01:27:51.917 --> 01:27:53.001
Oh, boy!

01:27:53.085 --> 01:27:54.159
He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:56.254
Who gets to make
the first joke?

01:27:56.338 --> 01:27:57.704
I think we should all do it
at the same time.

01:27:57.714 --> 01:27:58.715
Good call.

01:27:58.799 --> 01:28:00.342
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

01:28:00.425 --> 01:28:01.667
I only do over
the pants, mouth stuff.

01:28:01.677 --> 01:28:02.761
Fuck!

01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:03.960
<i>The Proposition</i>
has a wonderful

01:28:03.970 --> 01:28:04.971
Guy Pearce performance.

01:28:05.055 --> 01:28:06.805
Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.226
- Give us the line again.
- I need your help!

01:28:09.768 --> 01:28:12.062
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

01:28:12.145 --> 01:28:14.773
but you unleashed
the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

01:28:15.315 --> 01:28:17.567
I can't bring him down alone.

01:28:17.734 --> 01:28:19.277
So here we are.

01:28:20.612 --> 01:28:22.364
We're no longer
accepting applications

01:28:22.447 --> 01:28:23.824
for X-Force, unfortunately.

01:28:23.907 --> 01:28:25.325
Even if we were...

01:28:25.409 --> 01:28:27.109
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

01:28:27.119 --> 01:28:28.286
We don't have a lot of time.

01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:30.122
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

01:28:30.205 --> 01:28:31.685
No offense,
but if you know so much...

01:28:31.748 --> 01:28:34.084
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

01:28:34.668 --> 01:28:35.742
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

01:28:35.752 --> 01:28:36.753
kill baby Hitler.

01:28:36.837 --> 01:28:38.797
I use a device
to slide through time.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.508
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

01:28:41.591 --> 01:28:44.177
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

01:28:44.261 --> 01:28:45.387
one to get me home.

01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:46.596
Well.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.557
That's just lazy writing.

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.923
Your boy's
gonna kill the headmaster

01:28:49.933 --> 01:28:51.476
of the orphanage tonight.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.645
After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:56.440
Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

01:28:56.523 --> 01:28:58.483
So he keeps killing...

01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:00.026
and killing, and killing,

01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:01.319
and killing.

01:29:01.653 --> 01:29:04.865
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

01:29:07.451 --> 01:29:08.827
My People.

01:29:12.748 --> 01:29:13.874
Relax.

01:29:13.957 --> 01:29:16.418
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

01:29:16.501 --> 01:29:19.045
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:21.673
and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!

01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:23.425
The difference
is night and day.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.387
You remind me of my wife.

01:29:27.554 --> 01:29:28.680
I'm sorry.

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.213
I said, "You remind me
of my wife."

01:29:30.223 --> 01:29:31.583
No, I'm sorry
that you said that...

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:34.352
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.

01:29:34.436 --> 01:29:35.604
She always struggled.

01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:38.148
But she was funny...

01:29:38.231 --> 01:29:40.734
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:43.820
Something I could
never master.

01:29:44.738 --> 01:29:46.948
It was my fault she died.

01:29:48.575 --> 01:29:51.225
It was my job
to stop people like him.

01:29:52.287 --> 01:29:54.247
<i>I came close a few times.</i>

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:00.128
<i>He wasn't too happy
about that.</i>

01:30:01.838 --> 01:30:02.964
<i>He was trying to hurt me...</i>

01:30:03.048 --> 01:30:05.008
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

01:30:09.054 --> 01:30:10.722
Blessed are the wicked

01:30:10.806 --> 01:30:12.390
who are healed by my hand.

01:30:15.519 --> 01:30:16.937
<i>He came into my home...</i>

01:30:17.896 --> 01:30:20.774
<i>and took the only thing
that made it a home.</i>

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.363
Sound familiar?

01:30:27.405 --> 01:30:29.005
- I'm sorry.
- Uh-huh.

01:30:29.074 --> 01:30:30.742
No, I'm really sorry.

01:30:32.953 --> 01:30:35.080
But that isn't Russell.

01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:37.090
- It doesn't have to be him.
- If you knew what I knew...

01:30:37.090 --> 01:30:39.090
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:40.669
maybe a small
learning disability...

01:30:40.752 --> 01:30:42.128
splash of diabetes...

01:30:42.212 --> 01:30:43.505
but nothing
that can't be fixed.

01:30:43.588 --> 01:30:45.215
If you could go back...

01:30:45.298 --> 01:30:47.968
and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:49.469
No.

01:30:49.553 --> 01:30:51.263
I'd buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs.

01:30:51.346 --> 01:30:53.098
Of course I fucking would!

01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:54.933
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:57.018
I'm not asking you
to kill a kid!

01:30:57.102 --> 01:30:58.645
I'll kill the kid.

01:30:58.728 --> 01:31:02.190
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

01:31:02.274 --> 01:31:04.568
Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.

01:31:04.651 --> 01:31:06.653
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

01:31:06.736 --> 01:31:08.989
would want you to do
the right thing, wouldn't she?

01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:12.576
So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?

01:31:13.243 --> 01:31:14.911
Give me a chance to save him.

01:31:14.995 --> 01:31:16.395
- What?
- You said...

01:31:16.496 --> 01:31:18.154
once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

01:31:18.164 --> 01:31:20.500
If we can get to him
before that happens...

01:31:20.584 --> 01:31:22.210
promise you'll give me
a chance

01:31:22.294 --> 01:31:24.087
to put him
on a different path.

01:31:24.170 --> 01:31:25.340
Define "chance".

01:31:25.422 --> 01:31:27.722
I don't know. How long does it
take to save someone's soul?

01:31:27.724 --> 01:31:29.424
- That's not...
- I'll give you 30 seconds.

01:31:29.426 --> 01:31:31.426
- What? No!
- Best I can do.

01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:32.730
Take it or leave it.

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:44.649
He's doing it!

01:31:44.733 --> 01:31:46.293
Look at the little fella.
He's doing it.

01:31:46.401 --> 01:31:48.236
There he goes.

01:31:48.403 --> 01:31:49.821
Jesus Christ!

01:31:49.905 --> 01:31:51.364
Just shirt-cocking it.

01:31:51.448 --> 01:31:52.449
Ugh.

01:31:53.408 --> 01:31:54.743
There you go, little fella.

01:31:55.493 --> 01:31:56.828
Go on, you're doing it!

01:31:57.245 --> 01:32:00.081
My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.

01:32:02.292 --> 01:32:03.372
Christ!

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.086
That's disturbing.

01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:06.588
30 seconds.

01:32:11.968 --> 01:32:13.468
- Deal.
- Deal.

01:32:19.893 --> 01:32:22.938
Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.

01:32:23.021 --> 01:32:24.981
I really wanted to match,
you know?

01:32:25.065 --> 01:32:27.067
Being a menacing team.

01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:28.276
Oh, man, it sucks.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.945
That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.

01:32:31.655 --> 01:32:34.157
And that is just
the first five steps

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.951
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

01:32:36.868 --> 01:32:38.286
Where the hell
are we going?

01:32:38.370 --> 01:32:39.621
You said it yourself.

01:32:39.704 --> 01:32:42.624
Nothing can stop the
Juggernaut. We need backup.

01:32:42.707 --> 01:32:45.460
I will bathe in the blood
of your enemies.

01:32:49.798 --> 01:32:51.424
Can you turn off the music?

01:32:52.425 --> 01:32:54.427
You'll do no such thing.

01:32:54.594 --> 01:32:56.429
Why don't you just say it
in an Indian accent?

01:32:56.513 --> 01:32:58.213
- I'm sorry?
- Apology accepted.

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:00.350
This is a side of you
I do not like.

01:33:00.433 --> 01:33:01.434
Let me guess,

01:33:01.518 --> 01:33:03.343
some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.

01:33:03.353 --> 01:33:04.479
What the hell are you...?

01:33:04.562 --> 01:33:06.481
Once again, intolerance rears
its ugly head.

01:33:06.564 --> 01:33:07.816
I am so sorry.
It gets better.

01:33:07.899 --> 01:33:09.442
I'm not a fucking racist,
moron!

01:33:09.526 --> 01:33:11.403
That's precisely
what a racist would say.

01:33:11.611 --> 01:33:13.238
I'm with the old white guy
on this one.

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:14.531
And that's a twist.

01:33:14.614 --> 01:33:15.740
When this is over...

01:33:15.824 --> 01:33:18.064
I'm going to fuck you to death
with your own broken feet.

01:33:18.076 --> 01:33:20.203
And a sexual predator, too.
That's rich.

01:33:20.286 --> 01:33:21.663
I should have
finished college.

01:33:21.746 --> 01:33:22.831
So what exactly do you

01:33:22.914 --> 01:33:23.989
do in the future, anyway, huh?

01:33:23.999 --> 01:33:25.208
Some kind of soldier?

01:33:25.291 --> 01:33:27.085
Yeah, something like that.

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:29.337
I was a soldier.
Special Forces.

01:33:29.421 --> 01:33:32.048
I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.

01:33:32.132 --> 01:33:34.092
50 years from now,
you're very dead.

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:36.553
Your entire generation fucked
this planet into a coma.

01:33:36.636 --> 01:33:38.179
Boom!

01:33:38.263 --> 01:33:39.514
Spoiler alert.

01:33:40.765 --> 01:33:41.975
Planets.

01:33:42.142 --> 01:33:43.685
Next time, Uber.

01:33:43.768 --> 01:33:45.061
Here's a spoiler alert.

01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:48.023
You're not a fucking hero.

01:33:48.231 --> 01:33:51.943
You're just an annoying clown
dressed up as a sex toy.

01:33:52.318 --> 01:33:53.486
Well, I got news for you.

01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:54.863
My heart
is in the right place.

01:33:54.946 --> 01:33:56.448
Russell's not
gonna kill anyone.

01:33:56.531 --> 01:33:58.523
Because of me, he's gonna know
what real love looks like.

01:33:58.533 --> 01:33:59.576
We're all going to die.

01:33:59.659 --> 01:34:00.899
Because of you,
I'll always know

01:34:00.952 --> 01:34:02.829
what a grown man
with baby balls looks like.

01:34:02.954 --> 01:34:05.248
I'm a grower, not a shower.

01:34:05.415 --> 01:34:06.541
God, I wish this were a bus

01:34:06.624 --> 01:34:07.824
where I could pull
the string and get out.

01:34:07.834 --> 01:34:09.461
It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,

01:34:09.544 --> 01:34:10.545
or you'd be in the back.

01:34:10.754 --> 01:34:12.547
- I am in the back.
- Right here!

01:34:31.274 --> 01:34:32.942
I made mistakes!

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.944
I wanna take them back!

01:34:35.111 --> 01:34:37.989
You trusted me.
I took that trust...

01:34:38.114 --> 01:34:39.532
and turned it
into a glory hole

01:34:39.616 --> 01:34:41.117
in an airport bathroom.

01:34:41.201 --> 01:34:43.953
The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.

01:34:44.537 --> 01:34:47.082
But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.

01:34:47.165 --> 01:34:48.666
I was once an X-Man.

01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:49.793
Trainee!

01:34:54.464 --> 01:34:56.966
You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.

01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:58.635
They do stick better
than tape.

01:34:58.718 --> 01:34:59.718
Hi, Wade!

01:34:59.790 --> 01:35:00.790
Please don't.

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:03.650
Say whatever it is you're here
to say. Make it quick.

01:35:03.723 --> 01:35:04.724
Right. Quick.

01:35:04.808 --> 01:35:06.684
It's the kid.
Just like you, I let him down.

01:35:06.768 --> 01:35:07.769
And just like me,

01:35:07.852 --> 01:35:09.135
he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...

01:35:09.145 --> 01:35:10.470
because the whole world
wrote him off

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.856
as a piece of shit
a long time ago.

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.608
Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut!

01:35:13.691 --> 01:35:15.191
The Juggernaut!

01:35:15.235 --> 01:35:17.018
Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...

01:35:17.028 --> 01:35:19.197
And hi, Yukio! That was really
nice of you to say hi...

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.615
so I'm saying hi back.

01:35:20.698 --> 01:35:22.033
You guys make
a super cute couple.

01:35:22.117 --> 01:35:23.785
Yeah.
Where was I?

01:35:23.868 --> 01:35:25.703
Oh, yeah. You should never
meet your heroes...

01:35:25.787 --> 01:35:27.455
because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!

01:35:27.539 --> 01:35:29.364
And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...

01:35:29.374 --> 01:35:30.614
and causes nothing
but problems!

01:35:30.667 --> 01:35:33.670
Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.

01:35:33.753 --> 01:35:36.923
Do you know what would happen
to me if I helped you?

01:35:37.006 --> 01:35:39.050
I would be disgraced.

01:35:39.134 --> 01:35:41.136
You are a criminal,
a fugitive.

01:35:41.219 --> 01:35:42.720
But worst of all...

01:35:42.804 --> 01:35:44.556
you broke my heart, Wade.

01:35:46.224 --> 01:35:47.267
Then you know what?

01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:48.950
Your heart's in
the wrong place, big guy.

01:35:50.145 --> 01:35:52.814
Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...

01:35:52.897 --> 01:35:56.234
and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:59.404
So stay here
in Chateau de Virgin...

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:01.614
while we go get our fuck on!

01:36:04.784 --> 01:36:06.161
You're doing great.

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:13.293
So you wear
that helmet because

01:36:13.376 --> 01:36:15.086
your brother
tries to read your mind?

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:18.381
Yeah, but he's in
a wheelchair, so even-steven.

01:36:18.464 --> 01:36:20.925
Someone's coming.
It's Russell, sir.

01:36:21.009 --> 01:36:22.927
And he's not alone.

01:36:23.011 --> 01:36:24.679
Secure the children.

01:36:27.098 --> 01:36:29.475
They will not replace us.

01:36:29.893 --> 01:36:32.187
What do you say
we go fuck some shit up?

01:36:32.729 --> 01:36:36.566
"Let's fuck some shit up"
is my legal middle name.

01:36:39.903 --> 01:36:42.363
Watch my back.
I've got the old man.

01:36:42.572 --> 01:36:44.115
Amen, brother.

01:36:50.663 --> 01:36:52.165
Time to make the chimichangas.

01:36:52.332 --> 01:36:53.958
30 seconds.

01:36:54.584 --> 01:36:56.711
I finally know why I'm here.

01:36:57.128 --> 01:36:59.047
I was raised in this place.

01:36:59.130 --> 01:37:01.341
Well, not raised.
I was tortured.

01:37:01.424 --> 01:37:04.254
Wow! It's your cosmic reason
for being here.

01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:05.720
- Shall we?
- This is gonna be fun.

01:37:05.722 --> 01:37:06.762
Yeah!

01:37:06.846 --> 01:37:08.181
Hey! Been meaning
to ask you...

01:37:08.264 --> 01:37:11.517
what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?

01:37:11.601 --> 01:37:14.270
It's not dirt. It's the blood
of my dead daughter.

01:37:14.812 --> 01:37:17.190
<i>Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.</i>

01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:18.942
Give me some.

01:37:19.025 --> 01:37:20.526
They say
laughter heals anything...

01:37:20.652 --> 01:37:21.736
except, of course, that.

01:37:21.819 --> 01:37:23.029
We should just cue the music.

01:37:48.179 --> 01:37:50.890
Welcome home, Russell.
We missed you.

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.101
Russell!

01:37:53.184 --> 01:37:55.603
You don't need to do this!
Let's talk!

01:37:56.646 --> 01:37:58.166
Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?

01:38:02.277 --> 01:38:03.278
That's why!

01:38:03.361 --> 01:38:04.477
Told you this little fucker's
too far gone.

01:38:04.487 --> 01:38:06.614
Zip it, Thanos!
We have a deal and you fuck...

01:38:06.698 --> 01:38:08.658
Hey!

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.328
I'm gonna shove that
cab driver right up your ass.

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:15.623
My body and my hands
are so soft.

01:38:15.707 --> 01:38:16.990
You should probably
head back to the car.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.543
I think I'll head
back to the car.

01:38:19.836 --> 01:38:22.505
It works best
when you pull the trigger.

01:38:25.425 --> 01:38:26.718
That gun is amazing!

01:38:28.052 --> 01:38:29.262
Say it!

01:38:31.431 --> 01:38:34.434
You are an abomination!

01:38:41.774 --> 01:38:45.028
Now, I'm gonna shove
the red guy up the old guy.

01:38:45.111 --> 01:38:47.530
I believe him!
Every man for themselves!

01:38:51.909 --> 01:38:52.994
Gotcha!

01:38:53.786 --> 01:38:54.954
Beat it, midget!

01:38:57.957 --> 01:39:00.668
Hey, big guy,
the sun's getting real low!

01:39:01.085 --> 01:39:02.170
Oh, shit fuck!

01:39:16.059 --> 01:39:17.643
Come here, beautiful.

01:39:25.401 --> 01:39:26.527
Whoo!

01:39:35.745 --> 01:39:36.829
Say it!

01:41:00.288 --> 01:41:01.372
You came for me.

01:41:01.456 --> 01:41:02.874
I'm not giving up on you,

01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:05.042
and you are not
giving up on that boy.

01:41:05.126 --> 01:41:07.128
Who says that rules
aren't meant to be broken?

01:41:07.211 --> 01:41:09.464
It's time to fight dirty.

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:10.965
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

01:41:11.048 --> 01:41:13.801
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size!

01:41:13.885 --> 01:41:15.928
That's such
a you thing to say!

01:41:16.012 --> 01:41:17.597
Go get him, tiger!

01:41:18.014 --> 01:41:19.891
Big CGI fight coming up!

01:41:42.955 --> 01:41:44.290
He's doing great.

01:41:44.373 --> 01:41:45.583
Say it!

01:41:49.754 --> 01:41:51.172
- Russell.
- Bingo!

01:41:56.552 --> 01:41:58.513
You see that bus?

01:41:58.596 --> 01:41:59.796
I'm gonna
shove it up your ass.

01:42:03.184 --> 01:42:05.144
That's right!
I'm fighting dirty!

01:42:06.521 --> 01:42:07.480
Oh, great!

01:42:07.563 --> 01:42:08.638
There they are!
Those freaks!

01:42:08.648 --> 01:42:10.408
A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.

01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:12.360
Can I have
one of those guns?

01:42:12.902 --> 01:42:14.570
No.
That's fine.

01:42:14.737 --> 01:42:16.572
Get off this property,
mutant scum!

01:42:16.739 --> 01:42:17.899
I'm just gonna
use this brick.

01:42:18.491 --> 01:42:19.492
Maximum effort.

01:42:25.623 --> 01:42:27.373
Who says you
can't go home again?

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.000
Oh!

01:42:44.517 --> 01:42:45.517
Yeah!

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:49.063
Say it.

01:42:49.438 --> 01:42:52.483
Say what you said
every time you tortured me!

01:42:53.025 --> 01:42:54.026
Say it!

01:42:54.110 --> 01:42:57.113
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand!

01:42:58.322 --> 01:42:59.949
Blessed are the wicked...

01:43:00.491 --> 01:43:01.701
who are healed...

01:43:02.201 --> 01:43:03.703
<i>b'! my hand.</i>

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:23.472
You commie motherfucker!

01:43:50.541 --> 01:43:52.251
Oh, my God.
Did you feel that, too?

01:43:53.127 --> 01:43:55.338
Only best buddies
execute pedophiles together.

01:43:58.215 --> 01:44:00.426
You got 30 seconds,
you jabbering butt plug!

01:44:00.593 --> 01:44:01.802
Now we're getting it.

01:44:06.515 --> 01:44:08.726
I need a bus
to get you all out of here.

01:44:14.065 --> 01:44:15.107
Orphans.

01:44:16.275 --> 01:44:17.485
Oh, geez.

01:44:18.903 --> 01:44:21.489
It's time to burn
for what you've done!

01:44:21.656 --> 01:44:24.158
A child should not be burdened
with such power!

01:44:32.958 --> 01:44:34.043
Russell! Wait!

01:44:40.049 --> 01:44:41.342
Oh!

01:44:48.557 --> 01:44:50.557
Wait! He hasn't killed
anyone yet!

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.750
- What more do you need to see?
- Don't you fucking dare!

01:44:52.770 --> 01:44:53.854
He's just a kid!

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:55.898
Tick, took. Meter's running!

01:45:08.619 --> 01:45:11.664
I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.

01:45:32.059 --> 01:45:34.679
- I told you! Leave me alone!
- Come on!

01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:36.355
Listen to me!

01:45:59.587 --> 01:46:01.213
That's how we do it

01:46:01.297 --> 01:46:02.757
in Mother Russia.

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:07.511
They say millennials are
the hardest to reach.

01:46:08.888 --> 01:46:12.099
Oh, no.
You're doing amazing.

01:46:13.434 --> 01:46:15.936
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!

01:46:16.353 --> 01:46:18.063
Go home, Wade!

01:46:18.230 --> 01:46:20.065
You're ruining everything!

01:46:25.404 --> 01:46:26.614
I'm getting good at this shit.

01:46:26.781 --> 01:46:27.823
Go, go, go!

01:46:31.327 --> 01:46:33.162
He dies tonight, Wade.

01:46:33.329 --> 01:46:34.872
You can't stop me!

01:46:35.831 --> 01:46:37.581
He even runs
like a fucking pervert.

01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:40.550
Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.

01:46:41.921 --> 01:46:43.321
There's one bullet left
in that gun.

01:46:43.464 --> 01:46:45.344
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, just give me a second!

01:46:45.508 --> 01:46:46.842
I got this.

01:46:47.009 --> 01:46:49.129
- Russell!
- Stay back! Go home, Wade!

01:46:49.303 --> 01:46:51.430
Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!

01:46:52.014 --> 01:46:53.307
That piece of shit...

01:46:53.724 --> 01:46:55.364
he deserves to die
for what he did to you.

01:46:55.518 --> 01:46:58.896
He hurt you badly.
Makes you wanna hurt others.

01:46:59.772 --> 01:47:01.440
But if you kill him, he wins.

01:47:01.607 --> 01:47:05.110
You become everything
he says you are, but worse.

01:47:05.528 --> 01:47:06.987
You're just a kid.

01:47:07.571 --> 01:47:09.198
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

01:47:09.365 --> 01:47:10.491
How do you know what I want?

01:47:10.658 --> 01:47:12.284
Because I've been inside you.

01:47:12.952 --> 01:47:14.245
That came out wrong.

01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:16.455
I've been inside your shoes.

01:47:16.622 --> 01:47:18.374
Which is also off-putting.

01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:19.959
It's not a great analogy.

01:47:20.042 --> 01:47:21.460
The point is...

01:47:21.919 --> 01:47:23.587
there are people...

01:47:23.671 --> 01:47:26.590
There are people
in this fucking world...

01:47:26.757 --> 01:47:29.343
besides him,
who will treat you right.

01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:32.137
It isn't too late.
Don't do it.

01:47:37.685 --> 01:47:40.062
I never should've left
you there.

01:47:41.814 --> 01:47:43.691
I never should've left you
in that prison.

01:47:50.781 --> 01:47:52.074
I can't trust you.

01:47:53.784 --> 01:47:56.161
I can't trust anybody!

01:48:05.170 --> 01:48:06.380
Wonderful kid.

01:48:06.881 --> 01:48:08.424
You can't stop me, Wade!

01:48:10.676 --> 01:48:12.803
I got one more idea.

01:48:12.970 --> 01:48:15.848
It's just a really bad one,
even for me.

01:48:15.931 --> 01:48:17.099
Wade, what are you doing?

01:48:17.182 --> 01:48:18.902
All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!

01:48:19.602 --> 01:48:21.312
You're gonna kill
someone today...

01:48:21.729 --> 01:48:23.022
Blessed are the wicked...

01:48:23.188 --> 01:48:25.107
...then it's gotta be me.

01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:28.110
...who are healed by my hand!

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:33.657
Fuck this!

01:49:34.385 --> 01:49:37.346
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

01:49:42.351 --> 01:49:43.852
Oh, that's not good.

01:49:45.437 --> 01:49:46.855
No, sir.

01:49:54.488 --> 01:49:57.408
You sacrificed yourself
for me.

01:49:57.825 --> 01:49:58.951
Yeah.

01:49:59.034 --> 01:50:01.245
And it was the best thing
I ever did.

01:50:03.205 --> 01:50:05.290
I told you
I care about you.

01:50:05.374 --> 01:50:07.126
You're a good kid, Russell.

01:50:08.836 --> 01:50:09.920
Hey.

01:50:11.213 --> 01:50:12.423
The bear.

01:50:12.506 --> 01:50:13.882
It worked.

01:50:20.848 --> 01:50:22.349
Because of you.

01:50:22.516 --> 01:50:24.810
No, Wade, because of you.

01:50:25.686 --> 01:50:27.730
Stop, stop, stop!

01:50:27.813 --> 01:50:28.981
Stop!

01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:32.693
Just let it happen, okay?

01:50:33.152 --> 01:50:36.071
I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.

01:50:36.905 --> 01:50:39.324
That riddle
is so fucked up.

01:50:44.121 --> 01:50:46.415
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:50:46.582 --> 01:50:47.708
Don't be. Don't be.

01:50:47.791 --> 01:50:49.711
I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:51.754
Please, just don't leave me.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.422
I don't wanna die
without an audience.

01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:55.090
We are not going anywhere.

01:50:55.257 --> 01:50:57.342
Oh, God, I hope
the Academy is watching.

01:50:57.426 --> 01:50:58.552
Just rest, okay?

01:51:00.387 --> 01:51:01.472
Papa.

01:51:03.682 --> 01:51:05.642
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

01:51:07.895 --> 01:51:13.901
<i>Papa, can you find me
in the night?</i>

01:51:35.172 --> 01:51:36.423
Before I go...

01:51:36.965 --> 01:51:38.675
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

01:51:39.259 --> 01:51:40.385
Domino.

01:51:40.552 --> 01:51:45.057
I want you to have
my Adventure Time watch.

01:51:47.643 --> 01:51:50.521
Turns out
that I'm the lucky one.

01:51:51.271 --> 01:51:52.397
Thank you.

01:51:53.732 --> 01:51:56.652
Hey, Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch.

01:51:57.027 --> 01:51:59.196
I liked you better
with your hair short.

01:51:59.363 --> 01:52:00.531
Think everyone did.

01:52:01.323 --> 01:52:04.034
- Hi, Yukio.
- Hi, Wade!

01:52:06.078 --> 01:52:07.162
And you...

01:52:07.704 --> 01:52:08.831
Chrome Bone.

01:52:09.748 --> 01:52:12.126
I haven't always been
the best friend to you.

01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:14.962
But you've always been
that to me.

01:52:15.045 --> 01:52:16.421
So thank you.

01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:20.175
Say "fuck" for me.

01:52:21.009 --> 01:52:22.261
Just once. Come on,

01:52:22.344 --> 01:52:23.929
we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.

01:52:24.012 --> 01:52:27.015
Here we go. One, two, three.
F... F... F...

01:52:27.099 --> 01:52:28.100
Fuck.

01:52:28.267 --> 01:52:31.603
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

01:52:32.938 --> 01:52:35.190
And you, Cable.

01:52:36.066 --> 01:52:39.736
You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.

01:52:40.612 --> 01:52:43.824
And promise me.
Promise me one thing.

01:52:44.283 --> 01:52:45.659
That you'll start
judging people...

01:52:45.742 --> 01:52:47.077
not by the color
of their skin,

01:52:47.161 --> 01:52:49.037
but by the content
of their character.

01:52:49.788 --> 01:52:51.373
- Jesus.
- R-Dog?

01:52:52.583 --> 01:52:54.501
There you are. Hey!

01:52:55.085 --> 01:52:56.837
You're a superhero now, bubba.

01:52:57.337 --> 01:53:00.299
That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.

01:53:00.382 --> 01:53:01.758
This one is yours.

01:53:01.842 --> 01:53:03.552
You might wanna
get it steam cleaned.

01:53:03.635 --> 01:53:05.012
Especially around the pants.

01:53:05.095 --> 01:53:06.805
And let it out
a little in the waist.

01:53:07.764 --> 01:53:08.765
But, hey.

01:53:09.808 --> 01:53:10.893
Look.

01:53:11.185 --> 01:53:13.812
Family is not an F-word.

01:53:14.563 --> 01:53:15.856
All right?

01:53:15.939 --> 01:53:17.816
There's one out there
for you.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.110
Just keep looking, okay?

01:53:23.614 --> 01:53:26.366
Guys, for a second there...

01:53:27.201 --> 01:53:29.328
we made a pretty good team.

01:53:44.384 --> 01:53:46.386
Oh, it's so hard to go.

01:53:47.888 --> 01:53:50.265
I just love being around
you guys so much.

01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:52.601
So, so much.

01:53:53.310 --> 01:53:54.645
Mmm.

01:53:54.728 --> 01:53:56.897
No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.

01:53:57.606 --> 01:54:01.360
I feel the soul
exiting the husk.

01:54:01.443 --> 01:54:02.444
Yeah.

01:54:04.321 --> 01:54:06.156
Can you see it?

01:54:06.865 --> 01:54:09.034
Do you see
that beautiful bright light?

01:54:10.494 --> 01:54:11.662
There it is.

01:54:17.918 --> 01:54:19.127
Oh, that's the sun.

01:54:19.211 --> 01:54:21.046
Don't stare
directly into that.

01:54:21.129 --> 01:54:22.547
I just have a few final words.

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.176
<i>Woodpecker.</i>

01:54:26.969 --> 01:54:28.303
Gingivitis.

01:54:30.347 --> 01:54:31.723
Codswallop.

01:54:36.061 --> 01:54:38.021
<i>Do You Want to
Build a Snowman?</i>

01:55:53.013 --> 01:55:54.181
Sorry I'm late.

01:55:54.264 --> 01:55:55.932
There was a bunch

01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:57.382
of handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.

01:55:57.392 --> 01:55:58.602
- No.
- No.

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:02.356
- But I did have to help a kid.
- Yeah.

01:56:02.814 --> 01:56:04.691
- He's got a terrible name.
- It's just awful.

01:56:04.775 --> 01:56:05.975
- Ugh.
- I tried to tell him.

01:56:08.111 --> 01:56:09.529
Is this heaven?

01:56:10.405 --> 01:56:11.615
It is now.

01:56:15.077 --> 01:56:16.953
I am so sorry.

01:56:17.788 --> 01:56:19.122
It's okay.

01:56:38.975 --> 01:56:40.852
I missed you so much.

01:56:46.441 --> 01:56:48.110
What is it? What's wrong?

01:56:50.028 --> 01:56:51.530
It's not time.

01:56:52.155 --> 01:56:54.032
What do you mean
it's not time?

01:56:54.199 --> 01:56:55.700
I'm here, I made it.

01:56:55.867 --> 01:56:57.537
- You can't stay.
- No, no, no.

01:56:57.619 --> 01:57:00.247
I'm staying. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

01:57:00.330 --> 01:57:01.331
It's okay.

01:57:01.832 --> 01:57:04.668
There's a time for us.
It's just not now.

01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:08.129
- They need you.
- Who?

01:57:10.173 --> 01:57:11.466
Your F-word.

01:57:12.717 --> 01:57:13.718
Why?

01:57:13.802 --> 01:57:14.803
You'll find out.

01:57:16.054 --> 01:57:17.597
It's all right. I'll be here.

01:57:18.974 --> 01:57:21.101
It's pretty fucking
awesome up here.

01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:23.645
I can have anything I want.

01:57:23.728 --> 01:57:25.856
Can every day be
International Women's Day?

01:57:25.939 --> 01:57:27.315
It is heaven.

01:57:27.524 --> 01:57:28.775
I love you.

01:57:31.278 --> 01:57:34.030
I know. I love you, too.

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:36.032
Now, go.

01:57:36.908 --> 01:57:38.910
Go on. Go, get out of here.

01:57:39.953 --> 01:57:40.954
Go.

01:57:43.748 --> 01:57:44.749
Hey!

01:57:47.752 --> 01:57:49.921
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

01:57:50.547 --> 01:57:51.673
Well, come here.

01:58:11.026 --> 01:58:12.652
Don't fuck Elvis.

01:58:12.777 --> 01:58:14.527
- Ooh, too late.
- I'm sorry?

01:58:24.039 --> 01:58:25.248
Time to make the chimichangas.

01:58:25.332 --> 01:58:26.416
30 seconds.

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:27.709
Hey. Been meaning
to ask you...

01:58:27.792 --> 01:58:30.253
what's with the creepy,
dirty hobo bear?

01:58:30.337 --> 01:58:32.088
It's my daughter's teddy bear.

01:58:32.547 --> 01:58:33.840
Her name's Hope.

01:58:34.132 --> 01:58:35.258
Well...

01:58:36.092 --> 01:58:37.969
What are you doing?

01:58:38.053 --> 01:58:39.638
Somebody swiped right.

01:58:52.442 --> 01:58:54.819
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

01:58:58.156 --> 01:58:59.908
You sacrificed
yourself for me.

01:58:59.991 --> 01:59:01.493
It would seem I...

01:59:03.662 --> 01:59:04.955
Huh?

01:59:06.081 --> 01:59:08.416
Genuine, high-grade lead.

01:59:10.335 --> 01:59:13.338
You time-sliding
son of a bitch!

01:59:13.421 --> 01:59:15.006
You did this for me?

01:59:16.883 --> 01:59:19.386
Wait. You can't go back.

01:59:20.011 --> 01:59:21.263
You used
the last of your fuel.

01:59:21.346 --> 01:59:23.056
What about your girl,
your wife?

01:59:23.139 --> 01:59:26.393
Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.

01:59:27.852 --> 01:59:30.272
No, I'm gonna stick around
for a while...

01:59:30.355 --> 01:59:31.565
and make sure the world

01:59:31.648 --> 01:59:33.358
doesn't shit itself
into oblivion.

01:59:34.067 --> 01:59:36.945
No. You did it for me.

01:59:37.696 --> 01:59:39.030
No, I didn't.

01:59:39.197 --> 01:59:40.567
- You did.
- I really didn't.

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:42.500
- Pretty sure you did.
- No, I'm positive I didn't.

01:59:42.534 --> 01:59:44.286
Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?

01:59:44.369 --> 01:59:47.080
Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.

01:59:47.163 --> 01:59:49.583
I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Say it again.

01:59:51.167 --> 01:59:52.567
- He did it for me.
- Jesus.

01:59:52.570 --> 01:59:54.620
- We must get the collar off.
- Forget it. It's no use.

01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:56.429
These collars
don't just come off.

01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:57.550
Wade.

01:59:58.133 --> 01:59:59.759
I have an idea.

02:00:00.093 --> 02:00:02.178
No, no, no!
Let's not do that. Please!

02:00:02.262 --> 02:00:04.639
I'd rather die of cancer.
Let's just...

02:00:04.723 --> 02:00:07.851
Oh, God! They do say the pen
is grosser than the sword.

02:00:07.934 --> 02:00:10.186
We need the code.

02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:12.147
Try, uh, seven?

02:00:12.230 --> 02:00:13.773
Settle down,
Captain Lucky.

02:00:13.857 --> 02:00:15.275
It's not gonna be one number.

02:00:15.358 --> 02:00:16.518
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.

02:00:17.444 --> 02:00:18.778
I still got it.

02:00:21.823 --> 02:00:23.783
Put that back
in your prison wallet.

02:00:25.493 --> 02:00:27.370
I don't know how to thank you.

02:00:27.454 --> 02:00:28.955
But I do know how to hug you.

02:00:29.414 --> 02:00:30.664
- No.
- Yes.

02:00:30.749 --> 02:00:32.208
Here we go. Bring it in.

02:00:32.292 --> 02:00:33.293
Come on.

02:00:33.418 --> 02:00:34.711
Pelvis to pelvis.

02:00:34.878 --> 02:00:36.129
Let's go tip to tip.

02:00:36.296 --> 02:00:38.798
There we go.
The kids call this docking.

02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:41.676
Is there a knife in my dick?

02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:44.000
- There's a knife in your dick.
- I'm just gonna back up now.

02:00:44.012 --> 02:00:45.847
- Yeah, yeah.
- No need to go full Yentl.

02:00:45.930 --> 02:00:48.600
Gonna pretend
like that never happened.

02:00:48.767 --> 02:00:50.685
Let's go home, Russell.

02:00:54.356 --> 02:00:56.107
All you dirty mutants

02:00:56.191 --> 02:00:58.610
are gonna rot in hell
with the boy!

02:00:58.777 --> 02:01:01.738
Your souls
are beyond redemption!

02:01:01.905 --> 02:01:03.156
Let's see your soul, perv!

02:01:03.239 --> 02:01:06.034
No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!

02:01:06.117 --> 02:01:07.285
We're better than him!

02:01:07.369 --> 02:01:10.038
No more senseless violence!
No more bloodshed!

02:01:10.121 --> 02:01:11.665
We'll let karma
take care of him.

02:01:11.748 --> 02:01:14.751
The day of reckoning is here!

02:01:24.094 --> 02:01:26.096
I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.

02:01:26.221 --> 02:01:27.389
Whoo!

02:01:27.472 --> 02:01:28.973
Courage, motherfuckers!

02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:30.392
And karma, motherfucker.

02:01:30.475 --> 02:01:32.092
I could hear you
coming the last 30 seconds.

02:01:32.102 --> 02:01:34.062
I could barely keep
a straight face.

02:01:34.145 --> 02:01:35.939
I want some more.

02:01:36.106 --> 02:01:37.774
I bet you do, Brown Panther.

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:40.860
We should leave
before Fuckernaut wakes up.

02:01:41.444 --> 02:01:43.571
Good call.
You guys coming with us?

02:01:43.738 --> 02:01:45.657
No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.

02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:47.033
Besides, we're X-Men.

02:01:47.325 --> 02:01:49.869
No, you're X-People.

02:01:50.036 --> 02:01:51.329
You're exhausting.

02:01:51.413 --> 02:01:53.081
I see what you did there.
Puns.

02:01:53.248 --> 02:01:54.624
Our door's always open.

02:01:54.708 --> 02:01:56.468
That's kind, but
I'm not ready to date again.

02:01:56.543 --> 02:01:57.544
Let alone two women.

02:01:58.670 --> 02:02:00.296
God, you're a douche.

02:02:00.422 --> 02:02:02.507
- Bye, Wade!
- Bye, Yukio!

02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:06.302
<i>What do you get</i>

02:02:06.386 --> 02:02:07.544
<i>when you take
eight feet of chrome...</i>

02:02:07.554 --> 02:02:08.680
<i>one pinch of courage...</i>

02:02:08.763 --> 02:02:09.973
<i>a cup of good luck...</i>

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:11.558
<i>a dab of racism...</i>

02:02:11.641 --> 02:02:12.809
<i>a splash of diabetes...</i>

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:15.228
<i>and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?</i>

02:02:15.645 --> 02:02:17.814
<i>Answer: a family.</i>

02:02:18.398 --> 02:02:21.484
<i>See? I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.</i>

02:02:21.568 --> 02:02:22.934
<i>If there's anything
you take away today...</i>

02:02:22.944 --> 02:02:26.072
<i>other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...</i>

02:02:26.156 --> 02:02:28.950
<i>it's that we all need
to belong to someone.</i>

02:04:26.025 --> 02:04:27.735
How something
so small generates

02:04:27.819 --> 02:04:29.362
enough energy
to reverse time is...

02:04:29.445 --> 02:04:31.781
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

02:04:31.865 --> 02:04:34.117
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.441
Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.

02:04:35.451 --> 02:04:36.452
Never heard of him.

02:04:36.536 --> 02:04:37.996
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

02:04:39.289 --> 02:04:41.499
The Lord works
in mysterious ways,

02:04:41.583 --> 02:04:43.835
don't I?
A good day.

02:04:44.586 --> 02:04:45.587
Bye, Wade!

02:04:46.087 --> 02:04:47.088
Bye, Yukio!

02:04:48.423 --> 02:04:50.633
That was probably a bad idea.

02:04:50.967 --> 02:04:52.093
What have we done?

02:05:10.528 --> 02:05:12.530
I hope we sharpened
the cream cheese spreader.

02:05:22.707 --> 02:05:24.167
I'll be right back!

02:05:26.127 --> 02:05:28.671
We're definitely naming
our kid Cher!

02:05:29.047 --> 02:05:30.048
Whoo!

02:05:31.883 --> 02:05:33.134
Peter!

02:05:33.217 --> 02:05:34.761
Whoo! X-Force!

02:05:34.844 --> 02:05:37.055
Walk away! Just walk away!

02:05:37.931 --> 02:05:39.761
- But we're X-Force!
- Nope! We're not.

02:05:39.974 --> 02:05:41.309
X-Force is just
a marketing tool

02:05:41.392 --> 02:05:42.644
designed by Fox executives...

02:05:42.727 --> 02:05:44.395
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

02:05:44.479 --> 02:05:45.772
It doesn't exist.

02:05:46.022 --> 02:05:49.233
All right, well,
this has been pretty scary!

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:50.944
And I need to feed my cat!

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:53.488
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

02:05:53.655 --> 02:05:56.908
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

02:06:06.084 --> 02:06:07.961
Wade, is that you?

02:06:10.213 --> 02:06:11.547
I guess Stryker finally

02:06:11.631 --> 02:06:13.007
figured out
how to shut you up.

02:06:19.597 --> 02:06:22.850
Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

02:06:23.017 --> 02:06:25.019
Just cleaning up
the timelines!

02:06:25.103 --> 02:06:28.898
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

02:06:28.982 --> 02:06:31.234
and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.

02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:32.610
Huh?

02:06:32.694 --> 02:06:34.394
But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...

02:06:34.404 --> 02:06:36.364
to get back
in the saddle again.

02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:39.784
And when he does,
say yes.

02:06:41.035 --> 02:06:42.996
Oh, right.

02:06:43.913 --> 02:06:45.206
Love you!

02:06:47.583 --> 02:06:49.210
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

02:06:56.592 --> 02:06:58.428
You're welcome, Canada.

02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:12.108
Boy howdy.

02:07:13.985 --> 02:07:16.863
Hi. This is a toughie.

02:07:16.946 --> 02:07:17.947
Yeesh.

02:07:18.239 --> 02:07:20.658
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

02:07:21.868 --> 02:07:24.662
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

02:07:24.746 --> 02:07:27.540
Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:29.959
Oh, I'm going to hell.

02:07:30.043 --> 02:07:31.627
That makes two of us.

02:07:31.794 --> 02:07:32.879
You can do this.

02:07:33.046 --> 02:07:36.049
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

02:07:36.132 --> 02:07:37.300
All right.

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:46.559
Maximum effort.

02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:26.982
That's okay.
Let me see here.

02:13:27.066 --> 02:13:28.526
Oh, God.

02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:30.528
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

02:13:30.611 --> 02:13:32.530
No one's ever changed you.

02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:35.741
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

02:13:35.825 --> 02:13:38.285
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

02:13:38.661 --> 02:13:41.205
which would makes sense,
wouldn't it? Yeah.

02:13:41.288 --> 02:13:42.415
I think we both know

02:13:42.498 --> 02:13:43.697
I don't have
what it takes to do this...

02:13:43.707 --> 02:13:46.085
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

02:13:46.168 --> 02:13:48.119
and then I'm gonna come back
with my friend, Cable.

02:13:48.129 --> 02:13:49.463
He loves killing kids.
