-(BRAKES SCREECH)

15:07.658 --> 15:11.495
Well, isn't this a treat?
Where y'all coming from?

15:11.578 --> 15:14.915
-We just saw Old Slooshy!
-My favorite part was the slooshin'!

15:14.998 --> 15:18.502
-And now we're even.
-Isn't that nice?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.463
By the by, while you were off seein'
Old Slooshy...

15:21.547 --> 15:24.132
TRUDI: I toured the Museum of
Ginormous Antiquities...

15:24.508 --> 15:29.763
I tasted the galaxy's biggest hoagie...
And stayed at a fancy-shmancy hotel.

15:30.013 --> 15:33.642
Seasoned traveler like you, surely you've
been to all those places?

15:35.394 --> 15:38.772
Gee, whackers! I'm no math whiz,

15:38.856 --> 15:42.276
but I think that means, I'm ahead.
By three.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.485
Toodles.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.241
Not that it's a contest, that'd be
silly-willy.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.205
But if it was, I am winning.

15:58.542 --> 16:02.462
So who's parched, aside from me?

16:02.796 --> 16:07.342
Aw, I want to eat, see, and stay
at those places, respectively.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.054
Wander, you're not getting competitive,
are you?

16:11.138 --> 16:14.558
Sylvia, I am offended at the implication.

16:14.641 --> 16:19.271
I am simply expressing a
natural curiosity.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.232
Yeah, alright, alright, don't get your
socks in a bunch.

16:22.316 --> 16:27.279
(SIGHS) I guess they do sound like fun
side-trips. And the vacay can wait.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.405
(SQUEALS)

16:28.488 --> 16:32.367
But soon as we're done, we're headed
straight back to Ziziks for my float

16:32.451 --> 16:34.494
-Got it?
-Yeah yeah, sure, fine.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.788
Just hang a right and
ignore the speed limit!

16:40.876 --> 16:44.838
-It's so big!
-It's so big...

16:56.016 --> 16:59.811
Beautiful, impressive, inspiring,
just as good as the real thing. Done!

17:00.187 --> 17:01.230
Hey!

17:03.106 --> 17:05.275
Then again, I am kind of peckish.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.115
(BURPS) Check please!

17:16.245 --> 17:20.332
If you think a stay at Fancy Shmancy's
fancy hotel will make up for you eatin'

17:20.415 --> 17:21.708
my dinner...

17:21.792 --> 17:24.920
-(CHEERING) There's a spa!
-Enjoy your stay!

17:25.003 --> 17:27.297
-We will.
-We did.

17:27.381 --> 17:28.507
We what?

17:28.590 --> 17:30.968
WANDER: Trudi was right, those places
were amazing.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.136
Oh, were they? I wouldn't know.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.221
Take it from me.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.850
One of the two most traveled
folks in the universe, they were!

17:38.725 --> 17:41.478
Ugh, I really hate that sound.

17:41.687 --> 17:43.981
Well, isn't this a nice surprise?

17:44.064 --> 17:46.358
-Isn't it?
-It is.

17:47.526 --> 17:51.405
We just got back from those three
great places you told us about.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.909
Well, I guess that'd make us tied
if I hadn't just gone to five more.

17:59.204 --> 18:02.499
-(WANDER SQUEALS) Impressive.
-Impossible!

18:02.583 --> 18:04.918
She drives at the speed of dusty molasses.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.549
Five.

18:15.637 --> 18:22.436
Aw, I want to climb, observe, witness,
enjoy, and ride those things respectively.

18:22.561 --> 18:27.191
-Wander, I don't think it's...
-Please!

18:28.817 --> 18:32.279
No! No! Uh-uh! No way! Not gonna...

18:33.322 --> 18:37.159
Okay! But only if you agree
to take it nice and slow.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.411
-Deal?
-(WANDER SQUEALS)

18:39.494 --> 18:41.079
Let's go!

18:41.163 --> 18:43.832
I'm sensing a troubling pattern here.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.293
SYLVIA: The temple of Backalakabingbong

18:46.376 --> 18:48.754
was a place of solemnity and fortitude.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.214
WANDER: Done!

18:50.297 --> 18:52.799
SYLVIA: The delicate tardilius
plant blooms hourly,

18:52.925 --> 18:55.302
awakening slowly to show its
splendid petals.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.554
Done.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.933
The courtship ritual of
the Lorb requires patience.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.059
Done.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.728
The Klerblatz ceremony
you are witnessing

19:04.811 --> 19:06.688
has been unchanged for thousands of years.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.398
(DRUMS BEATING)

19:08.482 --> 19:09.483
Done!

19:09.566 --> 19:11.527
BUS DRIVER: And now
we are entering Shatterton

19:11.610 --> 19:13.195
the town made entirely of glass.

19:13.445 --> 19:16.740
-Of course, we are.
-We better take it slow or...

19:24.540 --> 19:25.582
WANDER: Done!

19:27.167 --> 19:29.920
I think we're clear. Gah!

19:30.003 --> 19:34.925
-Well, howdy hoo!
-Five, I saw five. Five.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.887
-Oh. I only saw four.
-Really?

19:38.971 --> 19:42.891
...tee. Four-tee. 40!

19:46.103 --> 19:48.772
-Got it. Hee-yahh!
-Hee-yahh?

19:55.737 --> 19:58.907
WANDER: Seen it, saw it, done it,
Did it, yep, yeah, sure, fine.

19:58.991 --> 20:02.077
Good, great, got it, win it.
Victory will be mine.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.080
(SYLVIA PANTING)

20:07.875 --> 20:10.294
You're a worthy opponent, Wander.

20:10.878 --> 20:12.462
Seems we're now even.

20:13.505 --> 20:19.261
I don't do even! Planet Pharphlung,
you, me, there, now!

20:19.344 --> 20:20.679
You're on.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.850
Let's go, Sylvia.

20:24.933 --> 20:28.854
C'mon. Adventure, sights exploring, fun!

20:29.062 --> 20:31.231
My feet hurt. I'm tired.

20:31.315 --> 20:33.901
I don't even want to think
about how thirsty I am.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.527
Ugh, now I'm thinking about it!

20:35.777 --> 20:38.864
(SIGHS) You got to choose, Wander.
It's her or...

20:40.199 --> 20:42.075
(GROANS)

21:08.101 --> 21:09.102
(SCREAMS)

21:22.866 --> 21:26.912
WANDER: Oh my. It's the birth of a star!

21:27.955 --> 21:30.582
It's so beautiful.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.586
Puts things in perspective, doesn't it?

21:34.920 --> 21:37.798
I... I don't know what to say.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.636
Actually, I do.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.805
TRUDI: Eat it, fuzzball.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.437
I've been doing this all wrong.

21:57.234 --> 22:00.571
WAITER: One Flarvarian Float, one straw.

22:00.654 --> 22:02.406
WANDER: Better make it two.

22:02.489 --> 22:06.618
-Wander!
-Sylvia, I am so sorry.

22:06.702 --> 22:10.163
I got so caught up in proving myself
the most traveled tourist

22:10.247 --> 22:12.875
in the entire universe!

22:12.958 --> 22:17.045
That I forgot the real reason I love
wandering in the first place.

22:17.129 --> 22:19.381
The roses you stop
and smell aren't as sweet

22:19.464 --> 22:21.758
without your best pal to smell 'em
with you.

22:22.718 --> 22:26.471
(SOBBING) Oh, man, what are you trying
to do to me with all the sappy

22:26.555 --> 22:30.434
sappiness. Garcon, one more straw!

22:47.284 --> 22:50.037
Where are you?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.622
Did you find him yet, Trudi?

22:51.705 --> 22:54.666
-Nope.
-Did you, Trudi?

22:54.750 --> 22:55.876
-Nope.
-You, Trudi?

22:56.043 --> 22:57.503
-Nope.
-How about you Trudi?

22:57.586 --> 22:59.046
-Nope
-Any luck, Trudi?

22:59.129 --> 23:00.339
Sorry, Trudi. No.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.590
You... What?

23:01.673 --> 23:02.799
-How about you?
-You?

23:02.883 --> 23:03.926
You?

23:04.009 --> 23:06.053
Uh, we'll never find him.

23:06.136 --> 23:09.640
Give it up, Trudi. Technically speaking,
the furry fella did win.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.934
Oh, just stop it, would ya, Trudi?

23:12.726 --> 23:16.355
Destroy them!
