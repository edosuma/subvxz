PREVIOUSLY ON
UNITED STATES OF TARA:

00:12.180 --> 00:14.282
DO YOU THINK DR. PETE
CAN FIX ME?

00:14.315 --> 00:16.250
I'M WARY OF ANYONE
WHO CALLS HIMSELF DR. PETE.

00:16.284 --> 00:18.252
SHE'S HERE?

00:18.286 --> 00:19.487
YES, THE PERSON IS HERE.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.389
THAT'S NOT MY BOOBY BUDDY.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.556
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

00:22.590 --> 00:23.591
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:25.859 --> 00:26.827
WAIT, IS IT A HELL HOUSE?

00:26.860 --> 00:27.828
A WHAT?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.330
THIS EVANGELICAL PLAY

00:29.363 --> 00:30.731
THAT THEY USE
TO SCARE KIDS STRAIGHT.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.200
IF MARSHALL WANTS
TO PUT HIS TIME INTO THIS,

00:32.233 --> 00:33.201
I'M SURE HE HAS
A VERY GOOD REASON.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.136
I HAD A BAD BUG ENCOUNTER.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.537
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.406
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO TARA

00:38.439 --> 00:40.508
WHEN YOU TWO WENT TO SCHOOL.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.675
HIS NAME IS TRIP JOHANSEN.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.144
I THINK I SAW SOMETHING.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.612

01:12.206 --> 01:14.275

HEY, DR. OCEAN.
MAX GREGSON.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.350
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU WORK WEEKENDS,

01:56.384 --> 01:57.851
BUT TARA'S TARA AGAIN

01:57.885 --> 01:59.220
SO I'D REALLY LIKE
TO MOVE HER APPOINTMENT UP

01:59.253 --> 02:00.488
BEFORE SHE TURNS.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.489
OKAY?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.291
CALL ME.
THANKS, BYE.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.193
SORRY, IT'S, UH, ME AGAIN.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.330
BUT, UH, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ALONE,

02:09.363 --> 02:10.831
AND YOU TOLD ME NOT
TO DO IT ALONE.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.766
SO...JUST...

02:12.800 --> 02:15.203
I THINK I MIGHT SO CALL ME
EITHER WAY, OKAY?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.209
HEY.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.543
UM, LISTEN, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE IT SOUND

02:22.576 --> 02:25.379
LIKE I WASN'T GONNA WAIT,
OKAY?

02:25.413 --> 02:27.648
I CAN DEFINITELY WAIT.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.683
I'LL SEE YOU AT
OUR NEXT APPOINTMENT TIME.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.620
AND I WON'T SAY A WORD.
I PROMISE.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.458
YOUR TUMMY MESSED UP AGAIN?

02:37.491 --> 02:38.692
WHAT?
NO.

02:38.726 --> 02:39.860
WHY?

02:39.893 --> 02:42.263
YOU'RE DOING
YOUR DIARRHEA DANCE.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.464
OH.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.665
NO, NO, I'M FINE.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.967

02:47.000 --> 02:48.802
OKAY, WHAT?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.804
NOTHING.
NADA.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.940
BABY, IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE PISSED OFF ABOUT,

02:52.973 --> 02:54.475
WE'LL END UP IN SOME DUMB FIGHT

02:54.508 --> 02:55.843
ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW,

02:55.876 --> 02:57.545
WHO FORGOT TO CHANGE
THE DISHWASHER FILTER.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.880
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE DISHWASHER FILTER.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.415
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.751
THEN JUST SAY IT.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.656
[laughs]

03:08.689 --> 03:10.691
UGH.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.427
I THINK THERE MAY BE
A NEW ALTER.

03:13.461 --> 03:16.930
OH, GOD.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.332
ARE YOU SURE?

03:20.301 --> 03:21.469
REMEMBER HOW YOU THOUGHT

03:21.502 --> 03:22.536
THAT NONE OF YOU RUINED
THE MURAL?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.971
DR. OCEAN SAYS

03:24.004 --> 03:25.706
WITH THE APPEARANCE
OF A NEW ALTER--

03:25.739 --> 03:27.241
WAIT, YOU AND DR. OCEAN
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS?

03:27.275 --> 03:28.476
ABOUT ME?
TOGETHER?

03:28.509 --> 03:29.810
WELL WE WANTED TO TELL YOU
TOGETHER

03:29.843 --> 03:31.279
BUT EVERY TIME I CALL HER,

03:31.312 --> 03:32.413
SHE JUST--
SHE NEVER ANSWER--

03:32.446 --> 03:33.447
TELL ME.
TELL ME EVERYTHING NOW.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.582
WHAT'S HER NAME?

03:36.884 --> 03:38.286
OH, JEEZ, IT'S ANOTHER DUDE.
GREAT.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.453
I'M SUCH A LESBIAN.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.954
IT'S NOT A DUDE.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.827

03:46.860 --> 03:47.995
[sighs]

03:48.028 --> 03:49.029
WHAT?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.498
WE'RE NOT SURE.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.565
IT'S ANIMALISTIC.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.502
PURE ID I GUESS.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.869
OKAY, YOU'RE MAKING ME SOUND

03:55.903 --> 03:57.871
LIKE AN EVIL, RABID SQUIRREL
OR SOMETHING.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.972
YEAH.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.974
WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.843
BUT THE SIZE OF YOU.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.013

04:40.914 --> 04:42.850
OH, COOL, ALICE.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.352
IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL?

04:44.385 --> 04:45.953
TOO SOON TO TELL.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.521
IT'S NOT GETTING MY ROOM.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.756

04:48.789 --> 04:50.090
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
YOU TWO

04:50.123 --> 04:51.091
WOULD'VE BEEN
HAPPY TO HAVE

04:51.124 --> 04:52.493
A BRAND NEW LITTLE NIBLET

04:52.526 --> 04:54.328
TO BAT AROUND
A YARN BALL WITH.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.497
OH, MY GOD.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.865
I'M OUT.

04:57.898 --> 04:58.866
HEY, MARSH,
YOU WANT ME TO PICK YOU UP

04:58.899 --> 05:00.033

EVERYBODY IN OVERLAND PARK

05:08.476 --> 05:09.977
I EVER HATED AND YOU'RE
GONNA GO PRAY WITH 'EM?

05:10.010 --> 05:12.346
I DON'T PRAY.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.347
HUH.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.483
HONEY, LISTEN TO ME.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.918
I'M SORRY BUT THERE
IS NO WAY

05:17.951 --> 05:18.952
THAT YOU COULD BE PREGNANT.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.521
TARA HAS AN IUD.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.956
OH, POOH, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN THOSE THINGS.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.991
WELL I DON'T THINK
IT MATTERS

05:24.024 --> 05:25.426
IF YOU BELIEVE IN 'EM.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.396
THE LORD WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.463
THAT MAGICAL SPIRIT
OF AN INFANT

05:29.497 --> 05:30.831

NOW IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

05:34.134 --> 05:35.636
I HAVE SOME RICKRACK

05:35.669 --> 05:36.670

HEY, ALICE.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.607

08:45.158 --> 08:46.894
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS

08:46.927 --> 08:48.161
AND GRAMBO KEEPS WINKING AT ME
WITH HIS ONE GOOD EYE.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.063
I--I HAVEN'T SAID A WORD
TO ANYONE.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.132
YEAH, BUT YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO KNOW, RIGHT?

08:52.165 --> 08:54.067
LIKE SUBCONSCIOUSLY
OR SOMETHING.

08:54.101 --> 08:58.005
LIKE IT'S LIKE I CAN FEEL YOU
CLAIMING ME.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.006
[sighs]

08:59.039 --> 09:00.240
IF IT'S COOL WITH YOU,

09:00.273 --> 09:01.942
I JUST THINK
WE SHOULD JUST CAN IT.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.944
CAN IT?
CAN WHAT?

09:03.977 --> 09:04.945
CAN THIS.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.714
YOU KNOW,

09:06.747 --> 09:08.616
I THINK IT'S KIND OF HARD
FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND

09:08.649 --> 09:09.850
BECAUSE, LIKE,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.052
OF YOUR GENERATION
OR WHATEVER.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.154
BUT, LIKE, YOU TAKE EVERYTHING
REALLY SERIOUSLY.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.156
LIKE...LIKE, PEOPLE MY AGE,

09:16.189 --> 09:18.158
WE JUST, LIKE, HOOK UP
AND THEN WE MOVE ON.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.128
SO, LIKE, LIKE,
WHEN YOU DO STUFF,

09:21.161 --> 09:24.865
LIKE, TEXT ME ABOUT
HOW MY LATIN TEST WENT,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.033
IT'S FUNKY.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.367
SO...

09:27.400 --> 09:28.836
MM-HMM.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.638
[sighs]

09:30.671 --> 09:32.706
I FEEL A LOT BETTER
SAYING THAT.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.942
I REALLY JUST WANT
TO BE AN EMPLOYEE AGAIN.

09:34.975 --> 09:38.145
I'M GLAD YOU FEEL BETTER BUT...

09:38.178 --> 09:39.780
I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THAT.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.854
I THINK IT'S BEST
IF I HAD YOU TRANSFERRED.

09:46.887 --> 09:50.658
WELL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT
BECAUSE THE CLOSEST BARNABEEZ

09:50.691 --> 09:52.259
IS, LIKE, 40 MILLION MILES AWAY
IN SHAWNEE.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.827
YEAH.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.896
I CAN'T WALK THERE
FROM SCHOOL, GENE.

09:55.929 --> 09:56.897
[laughs]

09:56.930 --> 09:58.231
FINE.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.332
THEN I'LL JUST TERMINATE YOU
THEN.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.770
ON WHAT GROUNDS?
PLENTY.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.272
YOU'RE THE SLOWEST
KETCHUP-MARRIER ON STAFF.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.807
YOUR REFUSAL TO FOLLOW
FASHION STANDARDS.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.408
GENERAL LACK OF GLEE.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.643
LACK OF GLEE?

10:09.677 --> 10:11.044
YEAH.
GENE.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.813
I'M SORRY, KATE,
BUT YOU'RE DONE HERE.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.815
UGH.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.350
GOOD-BYE.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.921
LEAVE THE VISOR.

10:23.857 --> 10:24.825
[fumes]

10:27.260 --> 10:29.730
[grunts, hums]

10:29.763 --> 10:31.064
[scoffs]

10:31.098 --> 10:32.099
STOP WATCHING ME.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.701
I'M NOT WATCHING.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.870
I CAN'T MAKE SISSY
WITH ALL THIS PRESSURE.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.740
[sighs]

10:39.773 --> 10:41.141
I'M SO EXCITED.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.310
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN AUNTIE, CHARMAINE.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.813
MM-HMM.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.417
YOUR NEW BUST LINE
TURNED OUT WELL.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.985
THANKS.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.020
DID IT HURT?

10:53.053 --> 10:54.855
I'M FEELING BETTER NOW.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.865
OOH, WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.900
IT'S PINK, IT'S PINK!

11:06.934 --> 11:08.802
I KNEW IT!
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL!

11:08.836 --> 11:11.171
[laughs]

11:11.204 --> 11:12.405
THAT'S NEGATIVE, RIGHT?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.274
YEAH, IT'S PINK NO MATTER WHAT.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.010
THERE'D BE A PLUS SIGN
IF THERE WAS AN ACTUAL BABY.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.145
THANK GOD.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.713
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE THERE

11:19.747 --> 11:21.214
THE DAY SHE TRIES TO CHECK
HERSELF INTO A HOSPITAL

11:21.248 --> 11:24.051
AND SQUISH OUT
AN INVISIBLE BABY.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.019
MAYBE I DO.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.822
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED WITH HEIDI.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.323
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
I MET HER.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.060
HEY, DOES THE NAME JOHANSEN
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

11:33.093 --> 11:35.328
GUESS THERE'S A BUILDING

11:35.362 --> 11:37.164
AT THE SCHOOL WITH THE FAMILY'S
NAME ALL OVER IT.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.165
I DON'T KNOW.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.800
GOT NADA FOR YOU.

11:39.833 --> 11:40.901
I WAS IN A WHOLE OTHER STATE.

11:40.934 --> 11:41.902
OW.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.103
[seethes]

11:43.136 --> 11:44.337
IT'S DRIVING ME FUCKING NUTS.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.139
IT'S LIKE I KNOW TOO MUCH

11:46.173 --> 11:48.341
BUT I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.943
I JUST WANT TO FIX IT.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.012
YOU'RE FUNNY.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.346
WHY?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.783
THAT YOU THINK
YOU CAN FIX IT.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.390
NOW FOR THE SMALLER BRUSH.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.226
THANK YOU.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.294
HMM.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.495
TIMES LIKE THIS I REALLY WISH

12:08.528 --> 12:12.065
TARA TAUGHT ME HOW TO PAINT.

12:12.099 --> 12:15.202
TARA CAN TEACH YOU THINGS?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.970
OF COURSE SHE CAN, SILLY.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.306
WE'RE NEVER TOO OLD TO LEARN.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.941
I LEARN FROM ALL OF THEM.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.876
EVEN T.

12:22.910 --> 12:26.013
[laughs]
EVEN BUCK.

12:26.046 --> 12:30.150
BUCK HELPED ME A BUNCH
LAST WEEK.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.184
[door opens]

12:31.218 --> 12:32.185
WITH MY SURGERY.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.854
OH, I LIKE HIM.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.255
HE'S SUCH A WILD MAN.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.324
[approaching footsteps]

12:37.357 --> 12:39.126
OH.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.961
I THOUGHT MY MOM
MIGHT BE BACK.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.095
OH, NO.
GOT WAY TOO MUCH TO DO.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.797
YOU OKAY?

12:43.831 --> 12:46.333
I GOT FUCKING FIRED
FROM MY FUCKING WORK TODAY.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.101
AND DON'T GO FOR THE SOAP

12:48.135 --> 12:49.269
OR I'LL FIND A SET OF STAIRS

12:49.302 --> 12:51.504
AND I WILL PUSH YOU
DOWN THEM.

12:51.538 --> 12:55.175
KATE.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.810
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WASHED YOUR HAIR?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.513
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
AN ABORTION TO YOU?

13:00.547 --> 13:01.815
KIND OF.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.183
OH, LIVER.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.452
OOH.
THAT LOOKS ABORTION-Y.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.420
COULD WE HAVE SEVEN POUNDS
OF THAT?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.256
(man)
SEVEN POUNDS IT IS.

13:09.289 --> 13:13.026
THERE YA GO.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.427
KENDRA GAVE ME THE MONEY.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.329
UGH, I HATE OKRA.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.330
WELL HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT?

13:17.364 --> 13:18.365
EXCUSE ME.
NO.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.599
WHY NOT?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.068
SOUNDS LIKE OPRAH.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.402
WOULDN'T WANT THAT
IN A CAN.

13:22.435 --> 13:26.239
SO YOU DON'T LIKE IT
BECAUSE OF THE LABEL?

13:26.273 --> 13:29.910
WANT ME TO...

13:29.943 --> 13:32.279
I HATE LABELS.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.882
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

13:34.915 --> 13:37.117
IF--IF THERE WERE NO LABELS
ON ANYTHING IN THE STORE?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.887
PRETTY RANDOM BASICALLY.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.454
YES, OKAY.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.156
SO PEOPLE WOULD TAKE
THE STUFF HOME

13:43.190 --> 13:44.557
AND THEY WOULD MAKE IT
AND EAT IT

13:44.591 --> 13:46.226
BEFORE THEY EVEN KNEW
IF THEY LIKED IT OR NOT.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.427
AND I BET A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD THROW OUT

13:47.460 --> 13:49.129
A BUNCH OF STUFF
THAT SUCKED.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.597
AND I ASSERT THAT
THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

13:50.630 --> 13:52.599
IF NOT MORE WOULD FIND
NEW THINGS.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.534
NEW THINGS THAT THEY LOVED.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.339
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
RIGHT?

13:59.372 --> 14:00.407
KIND OF.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.609
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.244
NO!
ALICE, COME ON!

14:04.277 --> 14:06.046
DON'T SPRAY ME
WITH THAT STUFF!

14:06.079 --> 14:08.248
I PROMISE IT'LL CHEER YOU UP.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.582
YOU KNOW WHEN TRIXIE'S BORN,

14:09.616 --> 14:11.518
WE'LL PUT MAKE-UP ON HER TOO.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.153
YOU'RE GONNA CALL HER TRIXIE?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.956
WELL EITHER TRIXIE
OR PAULINE.

14:15.989 --> 14:19.259
LADYBIRD.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.994
YOU KNOW, KATE, I AGREE.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.629
THAT MAN WAS A REAL POOH HEAD
FOR FIRING YOU.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.364
RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.968
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.970
YOU KNOW HOW WE WERE BROUGHT UP

14:30.003 --> 14:31.371
TO BELIEVE THAT MEN
WERE THE STRONGER SEX

14:31.404 --> 14:32.572
MADE OF HARD, HAIRY MUSCLES

14:32.605 --> 14:34.441
AND GRANITE AND IRISH SPRING?

14:34.474 --> 14:35.642
DID SHE JUST SAY
"HARD, HAIRY MUSCLES?"

14:35.675 --> 14:36.977
"HAIRY MUSCLES."

14:37.010 --> 14:38.111
AND LADIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

14:38.145 --> 14:39.546
THESE MUSHY CRYBABIES

14:39.579 --> 14:41.248
WITH SPARKLY PINK INSIDES?

14:41.281 --> 14:44.251
WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT MEN...

14:44.284 --> 14:46.153
ARE HIGHLY EMOTIONAL CREATURES.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.455
WE MUST NEVER HUMILIATE THEM.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.925
THEY ARE VULNERABLE
AND NEEDY.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.994
AND THEIR HEARTS ARE JUST
AS PINK AND MUSHY AS OURS,

14:54.027 --> 14:54.995
IF NOT PINKER
AND MUSHIER.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.329
EW.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.531
AND SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND
THAT MOST MEN

14:58.565 --> 15:02.135
FEEL SAFER AND STRONGER...

15:02.169 --> 15:03.136
WHEN WOMEN RAISE
THEIR VOCAL TONES

15:03.170 --> 15:04.437
BY JUST HALF A NOTE.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.074
IS THAT WHY YOU TALK
LIKE A DISNEY PRINCESS?

15:07.107 --> 15:10.010
THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT,
ALICE.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.144
I'M NOT GONNA CHIRP
LIKE A HUMMINGBIRD.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.513
MM-MM-MM.

15:13.546 --> 15:14.948
TRUST ME, LADIES.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.283
I KNOW OF WHAT I SPEAK.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.352
NOW LOOK AT YOURSELVES.

15:19.386 --> 15:23.423
DON'T WE FEEL LIKE
WE CAN DO ANYTHING?

15:23.456 --> 15:24.992
I LOOK GOOD.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.528
(Max)
I NEVER HAD
APRICOT PANCAKES BEFORE.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.163
THEY'RE GOOD.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.431
I'M GOING TO PUT SOME
OF THOSE APRICOTS

15:31.464 --> 15:33.466
UP IN JARS
SO WHEN FIONA'S BORN,

15:33.500 --> 15:34.667
I'M GOING TO MAKE BABY FOOD.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.136
FIONA?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.470
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE CALLING HER NOW?

15:37.504 --> 15:41.441
MM, I'M ALSO CONSIDERING
MARYBETH AND ELLODIE

15:41.474 --> 15:43.410
ELLODIE?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.577
NEVER HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.678
I MADE IT UP.

15:45.712 --> 15:46.679
[giggles]

15:46.713 --> 15:48.015
YOU KNOW WHEN BABY COMES,

15:48.048 --> 15:49.082
THE REST ARE GONNA HAVE
TO GET USED

15:49.116 --> 15:50.350
TO NOT BEING NUMBER ONE
ANYMORE.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.185
WHAT, DO YOU MEAN
KATE AND MARSHALL?

15:52.219 --> 15:53.620
NO, SILLY, THE OTHERS.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.423
MY CHARGES,
BUCK AND T.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.330
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"YOUR CHARGES?"

16:03.363 --> 16:04.731
THEY BELONG TO YOU?

16:04.764 --> 16:08.135
WELL SOMEBODY HAS
TO TAKE CARE OF THE BROOD.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.736
T'S A FLAKE

16:09.769 --> 16:11.671
AND BUCK'S A HIGH PLAINS WOLF.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.707
AND TARA, WELL...

16:17.477 --> 16:19.746
HEY.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.214
WANNA ASK YOU SOMETHING.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.284
IF YOU TELL ME WHICH
IS YOUR FAVORITE NAME.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.485
ELLODIE.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.487
OOH, I LIKE THAT ONE TOO!

16:29.656 --> 16:31.558
OKAY, IF YOU'RE THE KEEPER

16:31.591 --> 16:34.194
OF ALL THE ALTERS,

16:34.227 --> 16:36.363
ARE THERE ANY OTHERS?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.165
ANY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

16:38.198 --> 16:39.366
OOH! HA!
WHAT?

16:39.399 --> 16:42.069
OH, I THINK I JUST FELT
A LITTLE KICK.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.271
SHE'S GETTING SO STRONG.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.107
ALICE, WHAT ARE YOU
NOT TELLING ME?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.775
NOTHING, MY PRINCE.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.277
HMM?

16:50.310 --> 16:54.781
I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING
FOR ME.

16:54.814 --> 16:58.118
BECAUSE I GIVE YOU EVERYTHING
YOU WANT,

16:58.151 --> 16:59.386
DON'T I?

16:59.419 --> 17:00.753
HMM?

17:00.787 --> 17:04.157
DON'T I?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.130
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:10.163 --> 17:15.735
I WANT YOU TO MEET
TARA'S DOCTOR.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.305
FOR ME.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.608
[knocking]

17:21.641 --> 17:24.577
COME.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.616
I'D HAVE MAILED YOU
YOUR CHECK.

17:29.649 --> 17:33.153
I DIDN'T COME FOR MY CHECK,
GENE.

17:33.186 --> 17:37.257
I CAME BECAUSE...

17:37.290 --> 17:39.526
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
HOW EVERYTHING WENT DOWN.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.629
AND, UM...

17:42.662 --> 17:46.666
I JUST...

17:46.699 --> 17:48.835
I JU--I JUST WANTED TO SAY

17:48.868 --> 17:52.539
THAT I'M SORRY FOR SAYING
THE THINGS THAT I DID

17:52.572 --> 17:53.606
ABOUT YOUR GENERATION.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.177
IT WAS VERY MEAN OF ME.

17:57.210 --> 18:00.280
AND I DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE YOU FEEL OLD.

18:02.315 --> 18:05.118
IT DID MAKE ME FEEL
VERY JUDGED BY YOU.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.586
YEAH.

18:06.619 --> 18:13.126
AND I REALIZED THAT...

18:13.160 --> 18:14.594
WE'RE IN DIFFERENT PLACES
IN OUR LIFE.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.429
YOU KNOW?

18:16.463 --> 18:17.530
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.598
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

18:18.631 --> 18:20.600
THAT WE HAVE TO HATE EACH OTHER.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.202
I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.904
AND I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.

18:24.937 --> 18:30.443
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
A BIG HEART.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.848
THANK YOU.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.218
FOR SEEING IT.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.352
I DID.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.226
CAN I HAVE MY JOB BACK, GENE?

18:46.259 --> 18:48.161
HMM?

18:48.195 --> 18:50.463
GENE, CAN I HAVE MY JOB BACK?

18:50.497 --> 18:55.202
PLEASE CAN I COME BACK?

18:55.235 --> 18:57.170
SO I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO MY TOP THREE.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.739
ELLODIE, TRIXIE,
AND FIONA.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.741
(Ocean)
THEY ALL SOUND GOOD.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.676
YOU SEEM VERY EXCITED.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.512
OH, I'VE BEEN WAITING
MY WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.647
ALWAYS BEEN THE KIND
OF WOMAN

19:07.680 --> 19:09.482
WHO KEPT A HANDFUL
OF BUTTERSCOTCH CANDIES

19:09.516 --> 19:12.785
IN MY APRON TO HAND OUT
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.455
THE SOUND OF KIDS LAUGHING
IS LIKE...

19:15.488 --> 19:17.424
IS LIKE A BROOK THAT QUENCHES

19:17.457 --> 19:20.193
THE THIRST OF MY SOUL SONG,
YOU KNOW?

19:20.227 --> 19:23.396
BUT HE CHANGED EVERYTHING.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.832
YOU CHANGED EVERYTHING.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.468
I USED TO DREAM
ABOUT BABIES.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.570
NOW I DREAM ABOUT A BABY
WITH YOUR FACE.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.739
THANK YOU, ALICE.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.475
ARE YOU GOING TO, UM...

19:35.508 --> 19:37.477
WELL, I'M REALLY ENJOYING
MEETING ALICE.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.711
OKAY, I GOTTA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.384
[door shuts]

19:53.793 --> 19:56.729
SHE'S NICE.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.964
YOU KNOW...

19:57.997 --> 19:59.499
I NEED A MINUTE.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.537
[whispers]
NOTHING GOT DONE TODAY.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.406
NOTHING.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.275
LOOK, YOU TOLD TARA
ABOUT THE NEW ALTER.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.842
SHE TRANSITIONED IMMEDIATELY.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.511
SHE'S AFRAID IT'S TOO MUCH.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.879
THAT THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD LOVE ANYTHING

20:12.912 --> 20:14.547
THAT FAR OUT.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.583
YEAH, WELL, SHE'S GOT THAT
FUCKING RIGHT.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.917
MM-HMM, WELL,
LOOK AT ALICE.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.320
SHE'S SO INVESTED
IN KEEPING YOU

20:20.353 --> 20:21.921
THAT SHE MADE A BABY.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.657
A BABY THAT FOR ALL INTENTS
AND PURPOSES IS YOU.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.393
OH.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.527
I'M A BABY.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.661
THAT'S--THAT'S CRAZY.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.697
(Ocean)
YEAH, IT IS.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.700
CRAZY.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.336
MAX, I THINK...

20:36.369 --> 20:38.805
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO GET YOUR OWN THERAPIST.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.473
[knocking]

20:40.507 --> 20:41.741
HOOTIE HOO.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.310
EVERYONE GOOD HERE?
YEAH.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.345
YEAH.
YEAH, WE'RE DONE HERE.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.521
[sighs]

20:57.957 --> 20:59.592
SHIT.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.828
(Jason)
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE?

21:01.861 --> 21:05.965
UH, I THINK THE FIRST TOUR
STARTS IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.700
NERVOUS?

21:07.734 --> 21:10.803
NOT REALLY.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.705
HEY, HEY, HEY.

21:12.739 --> 21:13.706
HEY, DAD.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.074
BIG NIGHT, BOYS.
BIG NIGHT.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.410
WHAT'S THAT, UH,
THEATER CONVENTION?

21:17.444 --> 21:19.412
UH, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO SAY "GOOD LUCK."

21:19.446 --> 21:20.413
IT'S "BREAK A LEG."

21:20.447 --> 21:21.414
"BREAK A LEG."
THERE IT IS.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.649
BREAK A LEG.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.752
MARSHALL, CAN I HAVE
A MINUTE?

21:25.785 --> 21:26.753
YEAH.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.787
I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE, SON.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.055
MEET YOU IN THERE.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.862
I WAS JUST WONDERING WHETHER
ANYTHING'S CHANGED

21:35.895 --> 21:37.830
SINCE LAST WE SPOKE.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.832
NOT THAT ANYBODY CAN CHANGE
THAT QUICKLY.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.100
[chuckles]

21:41.133 --> 21:43.603
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
COME THROUGH HERE

21:43.636 --> 21:45.805
THINKING THEY CAN DO
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.840
THEY HAVE?

21:47.874 --> 21:51.478
BUT KEEPING CHRIST
AT A DISTANCE

21:51.511 --> 21:52.579
DOESN'T MAKE YOU COOL.

21:54.647 --> 21:59.051
YOU HAVEN'T ACCEPTED
CHRIST YET, HAVE YOU?

21:59.085 --> 22:00.820
OH, THAT.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.088
UM, YEAH.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.623
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:03.656 --> 22:04.924
YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.626
WHEN I CAME HERE,

22:06.659 --> 22:08.127
I DON'T EVEN THINK
THAT I WAS EVEN,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.963
YOU KNOW, LOOKING
FOR A PERSONAL SAVIOR.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.632
AND THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT YOU'RE PICKING UP ON.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.766
I KNEW IT.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.934
COULD SEE IT A MILE AWAY.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.703
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:16.736 --> 22:18.371
AS--AS SOON AS I AM READY
TO HAVE A PERSONAL SAVIOR,

22:18.405 --> 22:20.373
HE'S COMPLETELY ON TOP
OF MY LIST.

22:20.407 --> 22:22.675
WELL, GOOD.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.711
BREAK A LEG.

22:24.744 --> 22:25.778
JESUS.

22:25.812 --> 22:26.779
BYE.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.615
[whispers]
FUCK.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.787
[music from computer]

22:34.821 --> 22:36.823
[knocking]

22:39.559 --> 22:41.027
[music softens]

22:58.845 --> 23:01.681
(boy)
HURRY UP!
FILE IN! FILE IN!

23:01.714 --> 23:04.417
STOP DILLY-DALLYING!

23:04.451 --> 23:06.553
GET IN THE ROOM!

23:06.586 --> 23:08.821
OH, THANK YOU FOR AGREEING
TO COME.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.957
I THINK MARSHALL
WILL BE HAPPY.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.059
PLUS WE ALL MIGHT LEARN
SOMETHING.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.762
(together)
SATAN FOREVER!

23:15.795 --> 23:18.631
THIS KIDS THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST ABOUT THE MUSIC!

23:18.665 --> 23:20.199
LITTLE DID THEY KNOW

23:20.232 --> 23:22.969
THAT POPULAR MUSIC
IS SATAN'S FAVORITE WAY

23:23.002 --> 23:25.472
TO RECRUIT NEW SOULS.

23:25.505 --> 23:28.841
SOON THEY WILL BE MINE
IN HELL.

23:28.875 --> 23:29.942
FOLLOW ME!

23:29.976 --> 23:33.179
OOH.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.799
HELLO, KATE.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.668
THIS KID STOPPED GOING
TO CHURCH.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.804
HIS PARENTS THOUGHT
HE WAS GOING THROUGH A STAGE.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.207
HA!
A STAGE!

24:01.240 --> 24:04.010
NOW HE'LL BURN IN HELL
FOR ALL ETERNITY!

24:04.043 --> 24:05.244
CLOUDS CHANGE,

24:05.277 --> 24:08.080
CRACKING OPEN SKIES DERANGED.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.082
FRAGMENTS.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.485
FRAGMENTS.

24:12.519 --> 24:16.022
FOR THE UNIVERSE WOULD NEVER
BE THE SAME AGAIN

24:16.055 --> 24:17.757
THAT'S RIGHT!

24:17.790 --> 24:19.526
THIS IS WHERE THEY ALL
END UP!

24:19.559 --> 24:20.660
IN HELL!

24:20.693 --> 24:22.795
A HELL FAR WORSE

24:22.829 --> 24:25.064
THAN YOU EVER COULD'VE
IMAGINED.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.535
HOMOS!
RACISTS!

24:28.568 --> 24:30.202
(Max)
IS THAT MARSHALL?

24:30.236 --> 24:33.039
GAVIN NEWSOME!
MOVIE STARS!

24:33.072 --> 24:34.774
VEGANS!

24:34.807 --> 24:38.210
BUTT-FUCKING FRUITS!

24:38.244 --> 24:40.813
LET US MAKE HASTE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

24:40.847 --> 24:44.150
LET US MAKE HASTE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

24:44.183 --> 24:47.086
THAT WAS AN ORIGINAL PIECE
I WROTE ENTITLED

24:47.119 --> 24:49.556
"UNTIL AFTER YESTERDAY."

24:49.589 --> 24:52.625
KATE, I'VE GIVEN YOU
THE AFTER-SCHOOL SHIFT

24:52.659 --> 24:54.827
ON MONDAY AND I HOPE

24:54.861 --> 24:58.798
TO SEE YOU THERE.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.734
[sigh]

25:01.768 --> 25:03.202
(boy)
SO LET ME SURROUND YOU

25:03.235 --> 25:05.204
WITH THE ABUNDANT WHITE LIGHT
OF MY LOVE

25:05.237 --> 25:09.041
AND YOU SHALL BE RESCUED
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.944
NOW IF YOU WOULD PLEASE GO
TO THE SALVATION ROOM,

25:11.978 --> 25:13.613
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO TALK TO YOU

25:13.646 --> 25:15.615
ABOUT BEING SAVED.

25:15.648 --> 25:16.949
PLUS DONUTS.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.284
(man)
AMEN.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.153
[chattering]

25:21.187 --> 25:25.057
COULD YOU COME DOWN HERE?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.134
OH, DARLING, JUST IN TIME.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.603
JESUS IS BLESSING THE BABY.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.771
THAT'S NOT JESUS.
HE'S ACTING.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.573
HE WORKS AT THE THREE DAY BLINDS
BY THE INTERSTATE.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.641
HEY, PAULY.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.576
I KNOW.
I'M NOT A DINGWIT.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.177
HE CAN STILL BLESS OUR BABY.

25:48.781 --> 25:49.849
I'M SO SORRY.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.618
WOULD YOU PLEASE EXCUSE US,
JESUS?

25:51.651 --> 25:53.753
WHY DON'T YOU CARE
ABOUT THIS BABY?

25:53.786 --> 25:56.222
ALWAYS ALL, "TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO TARA.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.290
"I'M DUDLEY DETECTIVE
WITH A GIANT MAGNIFYING GLASS

25:58.324 --> 25:59.692
I'M GOING TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS."

25:59.726 --> 26:01.293
OH, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT?

26:01.327 --> 26:02.361
YES.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.963
YOU ARE RELENTLESS.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.097
I HEARD YOU TELL CHARMAINE

26:05.131 --> 26:06.766
YOU HUNTED DOWN HEIDI

26:06.799 --> 26:09.335
AND NOW YOU'VE GONE
AND BROUGHT GIMME OUT.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.140
ALICE, WHO'S GIMME?

26:16.275 --> 26:18.911
MAX, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.881
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, OKAY?

26:21.914 --> 26:25.151
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.056
TIME TO GO HOME.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.724
(girl)
WAIT, I CHANGED MY MIND!

26:31.758 --> 26:33.726
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.662
(man)
YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT

26:35.695 --> 26:37.664
WHEN YOU WERE HAVING
UNPROTECTED SEX

26:37.697 --> 26:41.033
WITH THE ENTIRE FOOTBALL TEAM!

26:41.067 --> 26:44.671
AAGH!

26:44.704 --> 26:48.074
[laughing devilishly]

26:48.107 --> 26:51.911
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

26:51.944 --> 26:56.315
[Alice sobbing]

26:56.348 --> 26:58.718
TARA?

26:58.751 --> 27:00.853
[grunts]

27:04.857 --> 27:06.092
ALICE?

27:09.328 --> 27:13.432
ALICE, ARE YOU OKAY?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.135
I LOST OUR BABY,
MY DARLING.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.303
I LOST ELLODIE.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.305
I LOST OUR LITTLE GIRL.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.808
OH, NO.
NO, HONEY.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.376
THAT'S NOT A MISCARRIAGE.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.145
I LOOKED AT OUR SCHEDULE.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.380
YOU JUST HAD YOUR PERIOD.

27:28.414 --> 27:33.886
YES, HONEY.
YES.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.287
OH, ALICE.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.723
[sobbing]

27:36.756 --> 27:37.890
COME ON, ALICE.

27:37.924 --> 27:41.728
[wailing]

27:41.761 --> 27:44.263
I LOVE YOU, ALICE.

27:46.866 --> 27:50.837
