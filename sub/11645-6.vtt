00:00.120 --> 00:03.559
Oh, my God! You fancy him,
don't you?

00:03.560 --> 00:05.399
Who was she?
She was...

00:05.400 --> 00:06.839
my girlfriend.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.959
She died.

00:07.960 --> 00:10.799
So did you wanna go for that drink,
like a date?

00:10.800 --> 00:11.999
Yeah.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.759
What about Shannon?
She's not coming back.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.719
You just had unprotected
anal sex with that girl.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.279
I most certainly did.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.719
And she loved it!
What if she's got HIV?

00:21.720 --> 00:24.279
Cute girls don't get HIV!

00:24.280 --> 00:27.159
Thanks for the hand job,
but you're quite old

00:27.160 --> 00:29.479
and you cry a lot.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.639
She was me first, Clare.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.639
He just sleeps with people,
he's out of there before he's had
time to take his condom off.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.599
This turning into a girl thing, is
that born out of some sort of sexual
confusion?

00:40.600 --> 00:43.119
You ain't lived
until you've had a multiple orgasm.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.759
All over your body,
like waves of pleasure.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.719
Were you... wanking?

00:48.720 --> 00:50.159
So what if I was?

00:50.160 --> 00:51.439
I think you've got your period.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.639
No-one needs to see that.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.279
Why did she stab me?
What did I ever do to her?

00:58.280 --> 00:59.599
That wasn't Kelly.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.559
She's swapped bodies.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.559
You'll be fine.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.879
All right?

01:20.600 --> 01:23.079
Top party! You are pretty.
You've got nice...

01:23.080 --> 01:24.719
What are them? These here.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.359
They're c-collarbones!

01:28.360 --> 01:32.079
Do you mind if I smell your hair?
Or is that a bit creepy?

01:32.080 --> 01:36.079
Bit creepy. Mm!

01:36.360 --> 01:40.359
All right? You know,
you have really slim ankles!

01:40.840 --> 01:43.439
Yeah, that smells like, er...

01:43.440 --> 01:46.639
smells like Ready Brek.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.279
Sexy bone, that.
Very... very underrated bone, innit?

01:50.280 --> 01:54.279
Mm.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.799
I'll tell you who's got
the best ankles... the Chinese.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.279
Because you never see a Chinese woman
with fat ankles, do you?

02:00.280 --> 02:01.839
I love Ready Brek, me.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.279
It's the, er...

02:03.280 --> 02:07.279
it's the breakfast of champions.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.999
Whoo!

02:21.840 --> 02:22.679
Mmm...

02:22.680 --> 02:26.079
Whoa, whoa! What is that?!
What is that?

02:26.080 --> 02:30.079
Oh!
Have we got any use for that? No?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.359
Wait.
What?

02:32.360 --> 02:33.719
I don't wanna do this if it's just
gonna be a one-night thing.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.359
No, no, no, no. Course not.
I'm sick of guys treating me like shit.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.679
Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah.
You promise you'll call me tomorrow?

02:38.680 --> 02:42.519
Love, I promise. I promise you
I am not one of them guys.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.399
That's it now. Oh, it's on!

02:45.400 --> 02:48.159
It is on! Sweet child o' mine!
Oh!

02:48.160 --> 02:49.479
Are you ready?

02:49.480 --> 02:52.039
Yeah?

Ooh! Hoo-ooh! Oooh!

03:20.520 --> 03:22.559
Nice one for that! I needed it.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.279
Oh! Listen, I, er...

03:25.280 --> 03:28.199
I think you're wonderful
and everything, but, er...

03:28.200 --> 03:30.399
I think it's only fair to say
I won't be calling you.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.119
What?! So you just fuck me and
leave? You said you weren't one of
those guys?

03:34.120 --> 03:35.959
Yeah, I lied. Have...

03:35.960 --> 03:37.759
Whoa, whoa!

03:37.760 --> 03:39.199
Ohh! Easy, tiger!

03:39.200 --> 03:43.039
Ahhh! Oh!

03:43.040 --> 03:45.959
It was nice knowing you and
everything.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.959
Wanker.

<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd, MemoryOnSmells</font>

04:38.079 --> 04:41.958
She was nice.
She was a... nice... nice girl.

04:41.959 --> 04:45.958
Nice and pretty.

04:47.239 --> 04:48.758
I've gotta be honest...
I don't really remember.

04:48.759 --> 04:52.478
You can't remember someone
you had sex with? Classy!

04:52.479 --> 04:53.878
Well, she was certainly happy
with the service.

04:53.879 --> 04:57.398
Look what old Rudy found
in his jeans this morning.

04:57.399 --> 05:00.038
The digits!

05:00.039 --> 05:01.678
So are you going to call her?

05:01.679 --> 05:05.078
No! No, I'm not.
And I'll tell you why.

05:05.079 --> 05:08.198
When you buy a dog, right,

05:08.199 --> 05:11.238
you know that one day,
the dog, it'll grow old

05:11.239 --> 05:13.038
and it'll die. Oh!

05:13.039 --> 05:14.998
And you're gonna be...
you're just gonna be heartbroken.

05:14.999 --> 05:16.758
Cos you loved that dog,
he was just a cheeky little scamp.

05:16.759 --> 05:20.758
Here's an idea. Don't buy
the fucking dog in the first place.

05:20.999 --> 05:22.958
Save everyone the bastard hassle.

05:22.959 --> 05:25.358
Right.
All I'm saying is,

05:25.359 --> 05:27.478
it's better that I make her cry
a little bit now

05:27.479 --> 05:30.518
than break her heart in three years'
time when she's totally in love
with me

05:30.519 --> 05:32.558
and we've bought
a load of shitty furniture together.

05:32.559 --> 05:36.558
It's... it's just the humane thing
to do, isn't it?

05:37.359 --> 05:38.998
You prick.
I know.

05:38.999 --> 05:41.078
What are we doing today?
We're doing nothing.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.838
The probation worker's dead.
Oh, yeah.

05:43.839 --> 05:46.838
Do we even need to be here?
If the probation worker goes missing

05:46.839 --> 05:48.678
and we don't turn up to community
service, it looks suspicious.

05:48.679 --> 05:50.398
Whoa, whoa.

05:50.399 --> 05:52.478
Shh-shh-shh-shh!

05:52.479 --> 05:55.558
What was that?

05:55.559 --> 05:59.558
I can't hear anything.

06:00.839 --> 06:04.838
There!
You must... you must've heard that?

06:07.159 --> 06:09.118
Bingo!

06:09.119 --> 06:11.758
It's the fucking ice-cream van!
Right, who wants what?

06:11.759 --> 06:14.638
Who wants what? Come on!
You... c-c-come with me!

06:14.639 --> 06:17.638
I need an extra pair of hands.
Curtis!

06:17.639 --> 06:21.478
Come...! Curtis!

06:21.479 --> 06:22.998
Come on.

06:39.919 --> 06:41.518
Oi!

06:41.519 --> 06:43.198
I said...

06:43.199 --> 06:44.958
ice cream!
Ice-cream van's here!

06:44.959 --> 06:47.478
What you having?
Look, don't worry about money.

06:47.479 --> 06:49.238
We'll sort all that out later.
Fuck off!

06:49.239 --> 06:51.918
Well, you'll be sorry, won't you,
when you've not got an ice cream

06:51.919 --> 06:53.758
and I'll, mm,
and I'll be licking an ice cream?

06:53.759 --> 06:55.598
You won't have anything.
You won't have anything!

07:00.359 --> 07:02.918
I'm gonna have to go inside.

07:02.919 --> 07:04.598
D'you have to?
Well, they always send

07:04.599 --> 07:06.598
a new probation worker
after we've killed one.

07:12.519 --> 07:15.998
Do you wanna come in?

07:15.999 --> 07:19.558
Yeah, all right.

07:24.119 --> 07:25.878
Hi.
Hi.

07:25.879 --> 07:29.878
I might...

07:29.879 --> 07:31.158
I, um...

07:31.159 --> 07:33.678
I... I'd like some ice cream.

07:33.679 --> 07:35.078
Good, cos I sell those.

07:36.439 --> 07:37.918
Right.

07:37.919 --> 07:39.438
Um...

07:39.439 --> 07:40.878
Three cones.

07:40.879 --> 07:42.398
And, um...

07:42.399 --> 07:44.838
and a rainbow lolly thing.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.878
D'you want some nuts and sauce?

07:46.879 --> 07:48.318
Nuts!

07:48.319 --> 07:49.678
Give me some nu...

07:49.679 --> 07:51.358
Whoa! Give me some nuts,

07:51.359 --> 07:53.558
extra sauce and a Flake, please.

07:53.559 --> 07:56.678
It's a buzzin' day, innit, man?

07:56.679 --> 07:57.918
No work, eh,

07:57.919 --> 08:00.558
nuts, extra sauce and a Flake.

08:00.559 --> 08:01.838
Could this day get any better?

08:01.839 --> 08:04.478
What?!

08:04.479 --> 08:05.678
What?

08:05.679 --> 08:09.038
Oh, hello.

08:09.039 --> 08:11.598
Hi.

08:11.599 --> 08:13.918
Where's your mate?

08:13.919 --> 08:14.838
He...

08:14.839 --> 08:16.798
had to make a call.

08:16.799 --> 08:19.198
Oh.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.998
There's your first two.

08:20.999 --> 08:24.998
Give. Give 'em.

08:32.318 --> 08:34.998
So... what was that all about,

08:34.999 --> 08:37.957
the whole... sex-change-switch thing?

08:37.958 --> 08:40.318
Dunno. Just happened.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.357
Well, may I just say, you're looking
particularly fine today.

08:43.359 --> 08:45.318
Me, personally,

08:45.319 --> 08:48.118
I could never get tired
of looking at that arse...

08:48.119 --> 08:49.198
Is that right?

08:49.199 --> 08:50.198
Right, now, you're gonna
have to tell me

08:50.199 --> 08:52.358
when you're gonna change like that,
mate, eh?

08:52.359 --> 08:53.758
It's horrible.

08:53.759 --> 08:57.758
Here.

09:00.719 --> 09:02.998
Hmmm...

09:13.599 --> 09:17.598
What the fuck is that?

09:19.559 --> 09:23.118
It fucking came off!
Me fucking dick's come off, man!

09:23.119 --> 09:26.038
That's what happens when you fuck me
and then just walk away.

09:26.039 --> 09:27.518
Have you done this to me?

09:27.519 --> 09:30.518
I'm not gonna let guys like you
do shit like this to me any more.

09:30.519 --> 09:32.638
Well, fuckin' pack it in ice, man!

09:32.639 --> 09:34.238
Oh, you dick! Look what you've done!

09:34.239 --> 09:37.838
D-D-D-Don't step on it!

09:37.839 --> 09:41.838
Take this.

09:47.359 --> 09:50.878
Is there... is there something wrong
with your penis?

09:50.879 --> 09:52.478
Jesus!
I know!

09:52.479 --> 09:54.638
Christ!
Dude, that is like

09:54.639 --> 09:56.798
no STD I have ever seen.

09:56.799 --> 09:58.918
And trust me, mate, I've seen 'em,
I've seen 'em all.

09:58.919 --> 10:02.158
It's a power thing. That... girl
you slept with, she gave it to you.

10:02.159 --> 10:03.998
How do you know?

10:03.999 --> 10:05.518
I saw the future. Put...

10:05.519 --> 10:09.518
Oh, sorry. Yeah. Well, what happened?

10:09.759 --> 10:10.758
It... it came off.

10:10.759 --> 10:12.278
What came off?
Your cock.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.598
My cock came off?
Yes. Then someone stood on it.

10:15.599 --> 10:19.598
- My cock came...! Well...
- I do not wanna live without my cock.

10:20.039 --> 10:22.478
That's just one version of the
future. We can change it.

10:22.479 --> 10:23.718
How?

10:23.719 --> 10:25.718
She said it was a punishment for
sleeping with her and walking away.

10:25.719 --> 10:26.958
Right!

10:26.959 --> 10:30.958
So I just need to fuck her again,
and my cock'll go back to normal,
won't it?

10:32.999 --> 10:35.558
I think so. I'm not sure.
I need to find her

10:35.559 --> 10:37.998
and shag her right now.

10:37.999 --> 10:39.358
You have her number.

10:39.359 --> 10:41.398
Ooh, f...

10:41.399 --> 10:45.398
Shit! Fuck!

10:58.439 --> 11:00.238
Really?
What did you expect?

11:00.239 --> 11:04.238
It's not a five-star hotel.

11:04.479 --> 11:06.798
Well, I mean, we can always leave
it, if you want.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.078
No!

11:08.079 --> 11:12.078
Come here.

11:22.159 --> 11:25.198
Right, so...

11:25.199 --> 11:26.838
read out the numbers...
I'm gonna dial it.

11:26.839 --> 11:29.078
Zero...
That's a start.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.838
Come on.

11:31.839 --> 11:34.038
Double seven, double zero,
nine, double zero.

11:34.039 --> 11:35.478
That's all we've got.

11:35.479 --> 11:36.998
W...
We're missing the last two.

11:36.999 --> 11:39.518
Right, well, I'm gonna have
to try every combination
till I get the right one,

11:39.519 --> 11:43.038
aren't I?

11:43.039 --> 11:46.238
Hello! My name's Rudy. I was just
wondering if you can help me.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.478
Did I have sex with you last night?
Because I...

11:49.479 --> 11:50.718
Hello?

11:50.719 --> 11:52.598
Hell...? Hello?

11:52.599 --> 11:54.558
Well, I'm sorry, but how rude's that?

11:54.559 --> 11:55.958
Eh?

11:55.959 --> 11:57.838
Unbelievable.

11:57.839 --> 12:00.358
Hello! It's Rudy.

12:00.359 --> 12:02.238
Um, basically... No...

12:02.239 --> 12:03.838
No, no, no, no, no. Not right now.

12:03.839 --> 12:06.478
I'm on the phone.
Um, yeah, just a quick question.

12:06.479 --> 12:10.478
Did I have sex with you last night?

12:11.799 --> 12:14.558
Hell...? Fuck!

12:14.559 --> 12:16.918
I'm not even gonna ask.

12:16.919 --> 12:19.398
This isn't going to work.

12:19.399 --> 12:22.878
You need to try and remember
what happened last night.

12:22.879 --> 12:26.078
There was one gi... two gi...
there was... There was three girls.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.078
There was definitely three.

12:28.079 --> 12:31.238
So it's one in three.
What were their names?

12:31.239 --> 12:35.238
I've no idea.
What did they look like?

12:37.319 --> 12:41.318
Ankles.

12:42.239 --> 12:46.238
Collarbones.

12:47.279 --> 12:50.158
Ready Brek.

12:50.159 --> 12:51.398
Ready Brek?

12:51.399 --> 12:54.038
If you've nothing constructive to say,

12:54.039 --> 12:55.678
then please, man, shut the fuck up.

12:55.679 --> 12:57.558
We should retrace your steps,

12:57.559 --> 12:59.678
go back to the house,
see if she's still there.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.678
Yes! See this guy?

13:00.679 --> 13:02.038
He's good!

13:03.359 --> 13:05.678
You're a logic guy, and I can...
I really can respect that.

13:05.679 --> 13:08.318
I bet you're really good at
Battleships, aren't you?

13:08.319 --> 13:11.328
Anyway, stop chatting.
We've gotta save me cock.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.651
This is it.

13:18.708 --> 13:22.707
Definitely.

13:39.489 --> 13:40.888
Where did you see her last?

13:41.252 --> 13:45.251
Bedroom.

14:05.252 --> 14:06.851
Here, man, it's her.

14:06.852 --> 14:10.171
Are you certain
you have the right room?

14:10.172 --> 14:11.611
Have we got any use for that?

14:11.612 --> 14:15.051
Yeah, man, I'm telling you, that is
her. That's definitely her.

14:15.052 --> 14:17.131
OK.

14:17.132 --> 14:19.571
So you just need to wake her up,

14:19.572 --> 14:21.251
talk to her

14:21.252 --> 14:23.491
and try to have sex with her.

14:23.492 --> 14:24.931
Or...

14:24.932 --> 14:26.531
Or what?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.491
Well, I mean, do I need...

14:28.492 --> 14:31.051
to wake her up?
Is that bit important?

14:31.052 --> 14:31.731
What d'you mean?

14:31.732 --> 14:33.091
Well...

14:33.092 --> 14:34.771
I dunno. Can't I just slip it
in there

14:34.772 --> 14:36.411
and give her a little
sleepy-fuck?

14:36.412 --> 14:37.811
That's rape.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.171
Is it?

14:41.172 --> 14:43.171
Yes!

14:43.172 --> 14:44.931
I'm not sure... that's a grey area,
dude.

14:44.932 --> 14:46.851
No, it isn't.

14:46.852 --> 14:48.811
Oh! What a dick!

14:48.812 --> 14:50.491
You've woke her up, man!

14:50.492 --> 14:52.611
Just wait here and just...

14:52.612 --> 14:55.171
make sure no-one comes in, yeah?

14:55.172 --> 14:56.851
Hello!

14:56.852 --> 14:58.811
Why are you still here?

14:58.812 --> 15:00.131
I get it.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.331
You're angry at me for walking out
on you.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.931
It was a joke!
It was a practical joke.

15:04.932 --> 15:07.811
And now here I am,
with these lovely flowers, look!

15:07.812 --> 15:10.971
I don't need flowers.
I need fucking painkillers!

15:10.972 --> 15:12.011
My head's killing me.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.051
Look, listen, right.

15:13.052 --> 15:14.451
I think... I think I'm fall...

15:14.452 --> 15:16.331
Stop it.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.171
I think I'm falling for you.

15:18.172 --> 15:19.491
Do you understand?

15:19.492 --> 15:21.851
Yeah? I think you might be the one.

15:21.852 --> 15:23.611
Can I have my tablets back?

15:23.612 --> 15:25.971
Last night, when we fucked...

15:25.972 --> 15:29.771
made love, whatever...
our souls joined together.

15:29.772 --> 15:33.771
Yeah? And here's the big news...

15:34.292 --> 15:38.291
I want to be your boyfriend.

15:53.292 --> 15:55.851
We'll settle down, we'll get an
'ouse. In the weekends,

15:55.852 --> 15:58.491
we'll go to Homebase, and in the
evenings,

15:58.492 --> 16:00.651
we'll cuddle up and watch
DVDs...

16:00.652 --> 16:04.651
All that can be yours.

16:05.012 --> 16:08.411
Shall we seal the deal with a bit
of sex?

16:08.412 --> 16:12.411
Why would I want to be your
girlfriend?

16:12.932 --> 16:14.331
Because you're a girl.

16:14.332 --> 16:15.571
It's what you lot want, isn't it?

16:15.572 --> 16:18.211
No.

16:18.212 --> 16:19.971
Anyway, I never slept with you.

16:19.972 --> 16:21.211
You did...

16:21.212 --> 16:22.291
I think I know who I had sex with.

16:22.292 --> 16:26.291
Well, how come I rock up here
at the scene of the crime

16:26.452 --> 16:28.771
and you're still in bed?

16:28.772 --> 16:30.211
Because I live here.

16:30.212 --> 16:31.811
Because this is my bed.

16:31.812 --> 16:33.331
Right...

16:33.332 --> 16:35.491
So you fucked someone in my bed?

16:35.492 --> 16:37.731
I need to leave.

16:37.732 --> 16:40.891
Are you... are you a doctor or summat?

16:40.892 --> 16:41.931
I'm a trainee.

16:41.932 --> 16:43.011
That'll do.

16:43.012 --> 16:45.251
I need an expert medical opinion
on something...

16:45.252 --> 16:45.971
Out you come.

16:48.052 --> 16:50.171
Simon! Simon, dude, it's not her.

16:50.172 --> 16:52.211
We need to get a move on, mate.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.211
What happened?

16:53.212 --> 16:54.691
I've just shown it to her.
It's gone black.

16:54.692 --> 16:56.611
It is not pretty down there,
my friend.

16:56.612 --> 17:00.611
All right, love, I'm Rudy.

17:00.652 --> 17:03.451
I think I know who it might be.

17:03.452 --> 17:04.971
Ooh, have I had sex with her?

17:04.972 --> 17:06.411
Wow.

17:06.412 --> 17:08.731
Do you know this girl?

17:08.732 --> 17:10.851
That's Amy Goodwin.

17:10.852 --> 17:12.011
Do you know where she lives?

17:22.852 --> 17:25.611
Never thought I'd say this...
I'm actually kind of bored.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.691
Ring the Council if you want,

17:26.692 --> 17:28.451
get them to hurry up
with the new probation worker.

17:28.452 --> 17:29.771
You're all right.

17:42.492 --> 17:44.411
Oh, hi.

17:44.412 --> 17:46.691
Not again.

17:46.692 --> 17:49.051
I keep randomly changing.

17:49.052 --> 17:50.811
Something's going on with my power.

17:50.812 --> 17:54.011
And my tits, they're really sore.

17:54.012 --> 17:55.171
Be honest...

17:55.172 --> 17:58.011
is this just an excuse
for being shit at table football?

17:58.012 --> 18:02.011
They're fucking killing me.
Is that normal?

18:09.892 --> 18:11.891
So...

18:11.892 --> 18:14.731
this is community service, is it?

18:14.732 --> 18:18.731
Yeah. It's usually much more shit
than this.

18:21.412 --> 18:23.211
Have you got a passport?

18:23.212 --> 18:24.731
What?

18:24.732 --> 18:26.651
Why do you want my passport?

18:26.652 --> 18:28.331
I thought we could go away together.

18:28.332 --> 18:31.331
What, like on holiday?

18:31.332 --> 18:34.531
Yeah. I was going to go on my own,
but...

18:34.532 --> 18:37.051
I was thinking Morocco,
somewhere like that.

18:37.052 --> 18:38.571
What's in Morocco?

18:38.572 --> 18:42.571
It's just somewhere to go.
Somewhere different.

18:44.172 --> 18:48.171
I've got my community service.

18:49.292 --> 18:53.291
It doesn't matter. Don't worry about
it if you're not interested.

18:54.052 --> 18:58.051
I'll think about it.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.611
Hang on a minute.

19:09.612 --> 19:13.611
Let me have a wee before we start.

19:14.812 --> 19:16.371
Who says romance is dead?

19:16.372 --> 19:18.251
Fuck off.

19:18.252 --> 19:22.251
Go on then, go for your wee.

19:42.372 --> 19:44.771
What's it doing?

19:44.772 --> 19:48.771
It's not doing anything...

20:04.772 --> 20:07.411
I'm pregnant.

20:40.412 --> 20:44.411
It's really starting to hurt,
this is, mate.

20:44.612 --> 20:45.731
This is her flat.

20:45.732 --> 20:47.291
OK.

20:47.292 --> 20:49.251
OK, biatch.

20:49.252 --> 20:51.331
It is frigging payback time.

20:51.332 --> 20:53.451
I'm going to fuck her so hard, man,

20:53.452 --> 20:56.651
I am going to fuck her
into the middle of next week.

20:56.652 --> 21:00.651
I'm going to fuck her so hard
she's going to be like a...

21:07.172 --> 21:10.171
That wasn't her.

21:10.172 --> 21:12.611
At least, I don't think it was.

21:12.612 --> 21:14.651
Can't have been that drunk.

21:14.652 --> 21:16.291
I think we need to leave.

21:16.292 --> 21:20.291
No! Whoa! No!
We are going nowhere, pal.

21:24.172 --> 21:25.531
Hello...

21:25.532 --> 21:27.251
Amy Goodwin.

21:27.252 --> 21:29.251
How are... how are things?

21:29.252 --> 21:31.571
Did you just flash your cock
at my sister?

21:31.572 --> 21:35.331
No.

21:35.332 --> 21:36.611
Yeah, I did, yeah.

21:36.612 --> 21:38.171
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

21:38.172 --> 21:39.731
She's in there now,
crying her eyes out!

21:39.732 --> 21:43.731
It was a simple misunderstanding.
I thought she was you.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.451
What are even you doing here?

21:46.452 --> 21:50.171
Flowers.

21:50.172 --> 21:53.251
Because you're... my flower.

21:53.252 --> 21:55.851
Right.

21:55.852 --> 21:57.091
Look, if this is about last night...

21:57.092 --> 21:58.371
Yeah,

21:58.372 --> 21:59.931
look, I apologise for that.

21:59.932 --> 22:02.291
I were bang out of order.

22:02.292 --> 22:03.571
It shouldn't have happened.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.811
You're right. I hold my hands up.
I'm sorry.

22:06.812 --> 22:10.811
OK.

22:10.932 --> 22:13.251
Look, it was lovely meeting you
and everything,

22:13.252 --> 22:14.691
but you really should leave.

22:14.692 --> 22:16.451
Look, whoa, whoa!

22:16.452 --> 22:18.531
I get it.

22:18.532 --> 22:20.571
I get it.

22:20.572 --> 22:22.211
Right? I was a prick.

22:22.212 --> 22:24.491
Can we just forget about it?

22:24.492 --> 22:28.411
I can't forget about it!
I can't forget about you.

22:28.412 --> 22:30.171
I want you to be my girlfriend,
Amy Goodwin.

22:30.172 --> 22:32.771
Can you please just fuck off

22:32.772 --> 22:34.771
or I'm gonna have to call
the police, all right?

22:34.772 --> 22:36.051
But, Amy...

22:36.052 --> 22:40.051
Amy Goodwin...

22:40.172 --> 22:43.171
I should do another one.

22:43.172 --> 22:46.371
Don't waste your money.
They'll all come out the same.

22:46.372 --> 22:47.931
It can't be right.

22:47.932 --> 22:51.931
Curtis, you're pregnant.

22:54.772 --> 22:55.931
You can't tell anyone, yeah?

22:55.932 --> 22:59.931
Don't worry, I won't.

23:00.772 --> 23:02.691
Who's the father?

23:02.692 --> 23:04.451
I don't know.

23:04.452 --> 23:07.331
Well, who did you have sex with
when you were a girl?

23:07.332 --> 23:07.931
No-one!

23:07.932 --> 23:09.411
It can't be no-one's.

23:09.412 --> 23:11.691
What about that stuff
with the creepy coach guy?

23:11.692 --> 23:15.171
Not him. He didn't do anything.

23:15.172 --> 23:19.171
Well, who then?

23:23.972 --> 23:27.971
Didn't... Rudy try it on with you?

23:33.052 --> 23:37.051
Motherfucker...!

23:37.212 --> 23:39.691
You should've seen her face. She
knows, she knows what she did to me.

23:39.692 --> 23:41.051
We need to think of something.

23:41.052 --> 23:44.691
Mate, you need to think of something,
cos you're the ideas man.

23:44.692 --> 23:48.691
I'm wasting away down here.

23:49.892 --> 23:53.651
How much money have you got?

23:53.652 --> 23:56.011
You're going to pay her
to have sex with you?!

23:56.012 --> 23:58.531
Well, let's have a better idea. Eh?

23:59.252 --> 24:02.811
Hang on.

24:02.812 --> 24:03.971
Yeah?

24:03.972 --> 24:04.851
Did you have sex with me?

24:04.852 --> 24:05.731
What?!

24:05.732 --> 24:07.851
Did you have sex with the girl me
that time in the locker room?

24:08.039 --> 24:09.304
'No, no, dude, I only went down
on you.'

24:09.352 --> 24:10.291
Well, then,
how come I'm pregnant?!

24:10.292 --> 24:13.051
Seriously? Mate, congratulations!

24:13.052 --> 24:15.731
Simon, our Curtis is pregnant.

24:15.732 --> 24:17.091
Yeah, mate, he's speechless.

24:17.092 --> 24:19.011
Listen, we're both really happy
for you.

24:19.012 --> 24:20.531
You're saying that nothing happened?

24:20.532 --> 24:22.051
'Dude, nowt happened.

24:22.052 --> 24:23.371
'Mate, I've got to go,

24:23.372 --> 24:25.331
'I've got more important things
to deal with right now,

24:25.332 --> 24:27.131
'like me cock, which is falling off!

24:27.132 --> 24:29.171
'Do one.'

24:29.172 --> 24:30.411
What did he say?

24:30.412 --> 24:32.811
He's saying his cock's falling off.

24:32.812 --> 24:36.811
What about the baby?

24:37.172 --> 24:38.371
Said it wasn't him.

24:38.372 --> 24:40.651
Well, it must be someone. These
things don't just happen on their
own!

24:40.652 --> 24:44.651
Yeah, I do know that!

25:00.212 --> 25:01.499
Oh, shit!

25:10.483 --> 25:11.242
Me again.

25:16.116 --> 25:17.175
What are you doing?

25:17.202 --> 25:18.961
I've got...

25:18.962 --> 25:20.721
£16.76.

25:20.789 --> 25:21.348
What for?

25:21.349 --> 25:22.788
Just forget everything,

25:22.789 --> 25:25.348
take the money, have sex with me.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.428
You think I'm a prostitute?!

25:27.429 --> 25:31.428
Or that you could be. If you wanted.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.748
Because you're so beautiful.

25:33.749 --> 25:34.708
Oh, my God.

25:34.709 --> 25:36.908
In the name of the Father,

25:36.909 --> 25:39.508
please, take the money and shag me!

25:39.509 --> 25:40.268
Look, I'll be really quick...

25:40.269 --> 25:41.628
Just get out.

25:41.629 --> 25:42.388
And I'll clean up after myself.

25:42.389 --> 25:45.148
Amy, are you all right?

25:45.149 --> 25:48.188
Will you go away? We're just
in the middle of something, sorry.

25:48.189 --> 25:51.828
It's nothing, it's... just some guy.

25:51.829 --> 25:55.828
Some... guy that you had sex with
last night.

25:55.829 --> 25:56.908
What?!

25:56.909 --> 25:57.788
What is he on about?

25:57.789 --> 26:01.268
I'm not ashamed of it, neither.
I'll scream it from the rooftops!

26:01.269 --> 26:05.148
I had sex with Amy Goodwin
last night, and she was amazing!

26:05.149 --> 26:06.228
You were amazing.

26:06.229 --> 26:08.788
We did not have sex.

26:08.789 --> 26:10.748
We just kissed, you twat!

26:10.749 --> 26:11.588
You kissed him?!

26:11.589 --> 26:13.948
OK, that does sound worse than it is.

26:13.949 --> 26:16.668
Whoa, sorry, we didn't have sex?

26:16.669 --> 26:17.588
So, what, you're back into guys now?

26:17.589 --> 26:18.868
I was drunk.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.348
Weird. I remember that
being the excuse last time.

26:21.349 --> 26:23.228
Can we talk about this later?

26:23.229 --> 26:25.348
Whoa, sorry to interrupt
this little...

26:25.349 --> 26:27.028
thing you've got going on here,

26:27.029 --> 26:29.868
but are you absolutely sure
we didn't have sex?

26:29.869 --> 26:32.108
Yes. So can you fuck off?

26:32.109 --> 26:34.908
Oh, ohhh, God!

26:34.909 --> 26:36.108
Ohh.

26:36.109 --> 26:40.108
Oh, er... Do apologise to your
sister for me, won't you? You know.

26:41.909 --> 26:45.508
Maybe come back and show her again
when it's better or summat.

26:45.509 --> 26:49.508
Nice one.

26:56.869 --> 26:58.468
It's not her, mate.

26:58.469 --> 27:00.588
It's got to be Collarbones...
she's the one.

27:00.589 --> 27:02.948
We should go back to the house
where the party was.

27:02.949 --> 27:04.268
Someone's got to know who she is.

27:04.269 --> 27:07.428
Come on, let's go.

27:07.429 --> 27:11.428
Oh, fuck!

27:32.989 --> 27:36.988
So... you're wanking off as a guy...

27:38.429 --> 27:42.428
and then swapping
and doing it again...

27:42.749 --> 27:45.348
as a girl?

27:45.349 --> 27:46.788
Uh-huh.

27:46.789 --> 27:50.188
Why?

27:50.189 --> 27:51.548
It passed the time.

27:51.549 --> 27:54.668
Ugh.

27:54.669 --> 27:58.668
I think I used the same...
the same tissue to...

28:00.149 --> 28:03.828
to wipe up.

28:03.829 --> 28:06.028
Both times.

28:06.029 --> 28:07.428
That is so fucking rank.

28:07.429 --> 28:11.428
Thanks for the sympathy, yeah?

28:11.469 --> 28:15.468
You got a sec?

28:23.509 --> 28:24.948
Are you pregnant?

28:24.949 --> 28:26.868
No.

28:26.869 --> 28:29.788
Well, there's this thing
in the toilet, a pee stick thing.

28:29.789 --> 28:32.868
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.681
Right. OK.

28:35.682 --> 28:39.681
It doesn't matter.

28:46.402 --> 28:48.721
This is really starting
to piss me off.

28:48.722 --> 28:52.721
Then just swap back,
just stop moaning about it.

29:02.602 --> 29:04.481
I can't switch back!

29:04.482 --> 29:08.481
You're kidding me.

29:14.602 --> 29:18.601
I'm stuck!

29:26.802 --> 29:30.801
Argh!

29:43.202 --> 29:45.241
Exposing yourself...

29:45.242 --> 29:47.961
to a 12-year-old girl.

29:47.962 --> 29:51.001
It were a simple misunderstanding.
Anyone could've done that.

29:51.002 --> 29:52.601
Your penis is going to fall off.

29:52.602 --> 29:54.521
What did I say to you?
I said, didn't I?

29:54.522 --> 29:56.401
If you go around,
acting like an idiot,

29:56.402 --> 29:59.161
sexing up all these girls,
you will catch something.

29:59.162 --> 30:02.881
I thought I might get the clap
or one or two crabs here and there.

30:02.882 --> 30:05.121
I weren't expecting this.
It's rotting away!

30:05.122 --> 30:07.201
Well, maybe if you treat her right

30:07.202 --> 30:09.641
instead of all the macho bollocks
all the time...

30:09.642 --> 30:10.321
Here we go.

30:10.322 --> 30:11.441
Just face it,

30:11.442 --> 30:15.321
the only reason, mate,
you treat girls like crap

30:15.322 --> 30:17.121
is because you're scared.

30:17.122 --> 30:21.121
You're scared if you let 'em in,
and they get to know the real you,

30:21.202 --> 30:23.041
you know,
then they might reject you.

30:23.042 --> 30:26.601
So you reject them,
before they get a chance.

30:26.602 --> 30:28.601
You never let your guard down.

30:28.602 --> 30:30.881
You are...

30:30.882 --> 30:32.801
pathetic.

30:32.802 --> 30:35.281
But now your todge
is going to fall off, so...

30:35.282 --> 30:39.281
Just shut the fuck up, man!

30:39.362 --> 30:42.961
Are you happy now?

30:42.962 --> 30:46.961
Yeah, I'm scared.

30:47.482 --> 30:51.481
I'm never going to have sex again
and I'm going to look like a freak.

30:53.162 --> 30:55.041
Well, I can't live with you
like this...

30:55.042 --> 30:59.041
you're going to do my head in.

31:00.642 --> 31:04.321
I might have an idea.

31:04.322 --> 31:08.241
I thought I'd cook you
some dinner tonight.

31:08.242 --> 31:09.841
Fishfingers, nothing special.

31:09.842 --> 31:11.921
Are you pregnant?

31:11.922 --> 31:13.001
What?

31:13.002 --> 31:14.401
It's OK.

31:14.402 --> 31:17.841
I know it's not what either of us
planned. I just want to say that...

31:17.842 --> 31:20.441
I'm there for you,
if you, you know...

31:20.442 --> 31:22.761
I'm not pregnant.

31:22.762 --> 31:23.961
I saw the pregnancy test thing
in the toilet.

31:23.962 --> 31:25.761
It's not mine.

31:25.762 --> 31:27.321
Well, Alisha says it's not hers,
so whose is it?

31:27.322 --> 31:28.841
I don't know!

31:28.842 --> 31:31.761
You can tell me.
Just... tell me the truth.

31:31.762 --> 31:33.001
I am!

31:33.002 --> 31:35.481
It's not mine.
I'm not pregnant, you dick.

31:35.482 --> 31:37.561
Right.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.521
So you can stop shitting yourself.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.721
What? It's fine, I wasn't worried.

31:41.722 --> 31:43.521
Nah, course you weren't!

31:43.522 --> 31:45.001
All right, maybe I was shitting
myself a little bit.

31:46.442 --> 31:49.481
Oh, it's work. I'd better get this.

31:49.482 --> 31:50.961
Yeah?

31:50.962 --> 31:54.361
Right.

31:54.362 --> 31:58.201
What, you found it?

31:58.202 --> 32:02.201
And where is it now?

32:02.882 --> 32:05.921
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

32:05.922 --> 32:08.281
Um... yeah, I want it.

32:08.282 --> 32:12.281
I'll be right there.

32:15.882 --> 32:17.201
Something's come up.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.601
I need to get going.

32:18.602 --> 32:21.961
It's fine, don't worry about it.

32:21.962 --> 32:25.961
I'm really sorry.

32:41.642 --> 32:42.921
Make it quick.

32:42.922 --> 32:46.921
Oh, I see... you're a watcher.
Well, unlucky, cos I need a shit.

32:59.642 --> 33:00.321
Oh!

33:00.322 --> 33:02.361
Are you all right?

33:02.362 --> 33:06.321
Just a bit of a messy one, mate.
You're better off out there.

33:07.642 --> 33:10.521
Swear you'll come back for me.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.281
Yep. Look, I promise.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.641
Thanks for doing this, man.

33:15.642 --> 33:19.561
Good luck, yeah?

33:19.562 --> 33:23.561
Hiya.

33:28.562 --> 33:31.921
I'm going to at least need some
antibacterial hand scrub

33:31.922 --> 33:35.921
or a hand towel. It's disgus...

33:55.602 --> 33:58.801
Just call me fucking Harry Houdini.

33:58.802 --> 34:00.601
I think I know where she might be.

34:00.602 --> 34:03.681
What?

34:03.682 --> 34:05.801
What's that?
Is that the best you've got?

34:05.802 --> 34:09.481
The future of my cock
depends on the slim chance

34:09.482 --> 34:12.641
that she's at some random nightclub?
Is that what you're saying?

34:12.641 --> 34:13.920
Yes.

34:13.922 --> 34:17.920
Well, let's get going, then!

34:24.042 --> 34:25.481
Shit.

34:25.482 --> 34:27.001
Yeah.

34:27.002 --> 34:28.801
I know.

34:28.802 --> 34:30.281
What are you going to do?

34:30.282 --> 34:31.601
I've tried everything.

34:31.601 --> 34:34.801
I'm stuck.

34:34.802 --> 34:36.681
So what happens to Curtis?

34:36.681 --> 34:40.041
I'm still here!

34:40.042 --> 34:43.201
So... what shall we call you?

34:43.202 --> 34:45.241
Like... Melissa or...?

34:45.242 --> 34:47.321
I don't give a shit!

34:47.322 --> 34:48.801
I'm going to have a baby.

34:48.802 --> 34:50.041
That isn't right.

34:50.042 --> 34:51.281
Kelly...

34:51.282 --> 34:52.360
I'm sorry.

34:52.362 --> 34:56.360
You can't have a baby where the mum's
a man who turns into a woman.

34:59.362 --> 35:03.361
There are options, you know.

35:05.322 --> 35:09.321
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:34.362 --> 35:38.361
It's in the boot.

35:40.122 --> 35:43.201
Are you going to ask me
where I found it?

35:43.202 --> 35:44.801
What?

35:44.802 --> 35:47.081
You know something,
after all this hassle,

35:47.082 --> 35:50.041
I thought you'd be
a little more excited.

35:50.042 --> 35:51.961
It's complicated.

35:51.962 --> 35:53.561
You do still want it, don't you?

35:53.562 --> 35:57.561
I mean, cos if you don't,
I can always find another buyer.

35:59.082 --> 36:00.361
Yeah.

36:00.362 --> 36:04.361
Yeah, I do want it.

36:33.922 --> 36:35.881
Don't worry,
I'm not going to hurt you.

36:35.882 --> 36:37.916
I've just come to take your power.

37:10.459 --> 37:11.578
Where is she, man?

37:11.579 --> 37:12.778
We should split up.

37:12.779 --> 37:14.258
Oh, that is a good idea!

37:14.259 --> 37:18.258
Listen, look for a girl with
beautiful collarbones, mate.

37:18.779 --> 37:22.778
All right? Good lad.

37:49.459 --> 37:51.018
Jesus Christ.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.058
Argh! Argh!

37:53.059 --> 37:54.658
Whoa. Oh, it's great to see you!

37:54.659 --> 37:56.378
You wanker!

37:56.379 --> 38:00.378
Listen, please, help me out.
Just shag me and make me better.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.378
What, you think that's
what this is about?

38:02.379 --> 38:03.738
I want another fuck,
and everything goes back to normal?

38:03.739 --> 38:06.098
I don't know what you want!

38:06.099 --> 38:08.538
I just didn't want to be treated
like shit!

38:08.539 --> 38:12.218
Guys like you, you shit on girls and
you just walk away, no harm done.

38:12.219 --> 38:14.018
You make me sick.

38:14.019 --> 38:18.018
Well, guess what?
Now your dick's going to fall off.

38:18.019 --> 38:19.538
And I'm glad.

38:19.539 --> 38:23.538
I'm hanging by a thread. I am
hanging by a thread! Help me out!

38:23.819 --> 38:25.138
Please help me.

38:25.139 --> 38:29.138
Fuck! Fuck's sake! My penis!

38:29.779 --> 38:33.778
Jesus Christ! Get out the way, move.

38:41.699 --> 38:43.258
Get off the stage, you wanker.

38:43.259 --> 38:46.738
Sorry to interrupt your party. Um...

38:46.739 --> 38:48.578
There's just something
I need to say.

38:48.579 --> 38:49.618
Fuck off!

38:49.619 --> 38:51.058
Hmm. I just want to say,

38:51.059 --> 38:53.498
to all the girls
I might have had sex with...

38:53.499 --> 38:56.058
and treated like shit,

38:56.059 --> 38:58.018
I am sorry.

38:58.019 --> 38:59.938
I'm sorry.

38:59.939 --> 39:03.178
I don't know why I do it.

39:03.179 --> 39:05.418
Maybe I am... scared.

39:05.419 --> 39:09.378
I just... I'm scared
that if you get to know me,

39:09.379 --> 39:13.378
when I'm not pissed and fucking
showing off, being a dick,

39:14.259 --> 39:16.858
you'll think I'm nothing...

39:16.859 --> 39:20.858
special.

39:22.179 --> 39:26.178
I'm just a twat with a big mouth.
Um...

39:26.459 --> 39:28.578
I never meant to hurt anyone.

39:28.579 --> 39:32.178
I'm sorry.

39:32.179 --> 39:33.458
Thanks, that's all I have to say.

39:33.459 --> 39:35.098
Fuck off, then!

39:35.099 --> 39:37.898
Shut up, you northern monkey!

40:03.459 --> 40:05.058
You looked like you meant that.

40:05.059 --> 40:07.018
I did. I did.

40:07.019 --> 40:08.778
You ever do this to anyone else...

40:08.779 --> 40:10.938
I swear! I swear to God,
I'll never do it again.

40:10.939 --> 40:14.938
Just make me better, please.

40:16.619 --> 40:20.178
Is that...? It's going back to
normal? It's going back to normal!

40:20.179 --> 40:22.058
Thank you so much!

40:22.059 --> 40:23.458
Anyway, nice knowing you.

40:23.459 --> 40:27.458
No, wait... I'm sorry, I didn't...

40:27.539 --> 40:29.578
I never got your name.

40:29.579 --> 40:32.378
I'm Rudy.

40:32.379 --> 40:36.218
Leah.

40:36.219 --> 40:40.218
You seem like a really nice girl.

40:40.699 --> 40:43.178
Do you want to...

40:43.179 --> 40:45.338
do you want to go for a drink?

40:45.339 --> 40:46.778
Oooh!

40:46.779 --> 40:50.778
So you want to get me drunk
and fuck me again, is that it?

40:50.939 --> 40:54.138
That's not what it is.

40:54.139 --> 40:56.658
It's not.

40:56.659 --> 41:00.658
See you later.

41:26.259 --> 41:29.098
'This is Seth, leave a message.'

41:29.099 --> 41:32.178
It's me.
I just wanted to say about Morocco.

41:32.179 --> 41:36.178
I don't know why I didn't say yeah
straightaway. I'm a dick.

41:36.539 --> 41:40.538
It's just that no-one's ever asked me
to go on holiday with them before.

41:40.699 --> 41:44.698
Anyway, yeah,
so just give me a call later.

41:45.779 --> 41:49.778
I miss ya.

42:13.219 --> 42:14.898
Where's Curtis?

42:14.899 --> 42:16.418
I don't know.

42:16.419 --> 42:18.378
I think he's got morning sickness.

42:18.379 --> 42:20.778
He should eat ginger biscuits.

42:20.779 --> 42:24.778
Apparently it helps
alleviate the nausea.

42:24.899 --> 42:28.898
Check this out!
Here you are, check it out.

42:29.859 --> 42:32.018
Check that bastard out,
it's immaculate!

42:32.019 --> 42:33.378
I'm very happy for you.

42:33.379 --> 42:34.498
Thank you.

42:34.499 --> 42:36.858
And, you know, thank you.

42:36.859 --> 42:39.938
Your boyfriend helped save my cock,
did you know that?

42:39.939 --> 42:41.218
I'm so proud!

42:41.219 --> 42:42.898
Yeah, and so you bloody should be.

42:42.899 --> 42:44.978
Do you know what, man?
It made me wonder.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.818
Cos you can't live life
for yourself.

42:46.819 --> 42:48.778
You've got to think about
other people.

42:48.779 --> 42:50.578
Like that song, you know...

42:50.579 --> 42:52.938
High School Musical,

42:52.939 --> 42:54.258
We're All In This Together?

42:54.259 --> 42:58.258
I never understood that song,
until now, mate. And...

42:59.219 --> 43:00.738
Oh, mate!

43:00.739 --> 43:01.858
I'm sorry.

43:01.859 --> 43:04.258
I completely forgot, mate.

43:04.259 --> 43:06.818
I'm... I'm sorry!

43:06.819 --> 43:08.178
Don't be like that!

43:08.179 --> 43:11.338
Don't, mate. I would've
remembered you eventually!

43:11.339 --> 43:12.538
Don't... Fuck!

43:12.539 --> 43:14.298
Dude! Come here, mate.

43:14.299 --> 43:18.298
Sorry. I'm sorry!

43:23.859 --> 43:26.698
And how can I help you today?

43:26.699 --> 43:30.458
It's me, Curtis.

43:30.459 --> 43:32.298
Right.

43:32.299 --> 43:34.658
Suits you.

43:34.659 --> 43:36.138
I'm stuck.

43:36.139 --> 43:37.498
I can't switch back.

43:37.499 --> 43:41.498
I need you to take my power.

43:43.459 --> 43:46.018
I can help you.

43:46.019 --> 43:47.498
But I need you to do
something for me.

43:47.499 --> 43:48.538
Whatever.

43:48.539 --> 43:49.658
I'll do it.

43:49.659 --> 43:51.418
I've got another power.

43:51.419 --> 43:54.978
I need to put it in you,
and you'll have to use it for me.

43:54.979 --> 43:57.738
What power?

43:57.739 --> 44:01.338
The power to bring people
back from the dead.

44:01.339 --> 44:02.418
Like who?

44:02.419 --> 44:05.458
A girl.

44:05.459 --> 44:09.458
I'm going to need more than that.

44:10.619 --> 44:13.218
My dead girlfriend.

44:13.219 --> 44:15.898
Ah, nah. Kelly's a mate.
I can't do that to her.

44:15.899 --> 44:18.418
It isn't like that.

44:18.419 --> 44:22.338
I need to do this.

44:22.339 --> 44:26.338
We can help each other out.

44:34.579 --> 44:38.578
OK.

45:12.859 --> 45:15.898
Let's go resurrect
my dead girlfriend.

45:15.899 --> 45:17.778
What the fuck is going on?

45:17.779 --> 45:19.018
Why are you dumping me?

45:19.019 --> 45:20.058
Shannon's alive.

45:20.059 --> 45:23.218
Cheerleaders! Sweet!

45:23.219 --> 45:25.058
He's dead.

45:25.059 --> 45:27.778
Mr Miggles got hit by a car.
I brought him back to life.

45:27.779 --> 45:28.858
Miggles!

45:28.859 --> 45:30.018
He attacked me.

45:30.019 --> 45:32.978
They think you're a zombie.
They're coming to kill you.

45:32.979 --> 45:36.978
We smash their skulls to destroy
their brains. We kill them all.

45:38.619 --> 45:41.458
We're really not bad kids.

45:41.459 --> 45:42.475
Yeah.

45:42.983 --> 45:48.283
