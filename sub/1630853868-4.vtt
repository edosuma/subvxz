WEBVTT

00:11.791 --> 00:13.000
<i>Slyrak?</i>

00:13.083 --> 00:16.000
The Eldwurm… Slyrak?

00:17.041 --> 00:20.250
I thought our local militia captain
took the cake for crazy.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.916
Have another round.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.458
Maybe then you'll grow some balls,
who gets a big one, hero.

00:27.541 --> 00:30.625
Poor bastard has a death wish,
and so do you.

00:31.208 --> 00:33.125
So, you won't help me?

00:33.208 --> 00:34.208
I am helping you.

00:34.916 --> 00:35.791
I'm saying no.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.625
Have a drink. Have some fun.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.208
-Have a good night.
-Good luck to you.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.833
I'm sure you and Slyrak
will be very happy together.

00:45.625 --> 00:46.750
Slyrak.

00:47.541 --> 00:48.750
Coward.

00:48.833 --> 00:51.375
Ladies have asked me
to do some questionable things.

00:51.458 --> 00:55.333
But this one?
This one is as crazy as she is beautiful.

00:55.416 --> 00:57.208
So, you're saying she's your type?

00:58.916 --> 01:00.458
-Not tonight.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.041
Of course I walked away.

01:07.125 --> 01:09.125
Did you see him? He's a disaster.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.375
I made a mistake coming here.

01:13.041 --> 01:15.500
-I know where Slyrak sleeps.

01:15.583 --> 01:18.458
I don't need that, man. That Davion.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.750
You're right, Marci.

01:25.125 --> 01:27.166
You're always right.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.166
<i> Praise Mene.</i>

02:23.833 --> 02:27.083
<i>Embrace the night.
Embrace my shadow.</i>

02:30.250 --> 02:31.833
<i>Love her together.</i>

02:36.083 --> 02:37.583
I've missed you.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
-What?
-We've all missed you.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.958
Who are you?

02:57.583 --> 02:58.500
Dyfed.

02:58.583 --> 02:59.625
Adara.

02:59.708 --> 03:00.833
Idwal.

03:00.916 --> 03:02.041
-Goddess?
-Goddess?

03:02.125 --> 03:03.791
-Are you all right?
-Goddess?

03:05.500 --> 03:06.375
Dyfed.

03:06.458 --> 03:07.500
Adara.

03:07.583 --> 03:08.666
Idwal.

03:17.541 --> 03:18.541
What is this?

03:19.125 --> 03:20.625
The flower's movements.

03:20.708 --> 03:22.500
Most plants follow the sun.

03:23.041 --> 03:24.458
This one doesn't.

03:24.541 --> 03:26.291
This one follows the moon.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.833
Isn't that wonderful?

03:43.000 --> 03:43.833
Davion?

03:45.375 --> 03:46.291
Davion!

03:49.750 --> 03:50.791
You again?

03:50.875 --> 03:53.000
Gods' mercy, woman. What is it?

03:53.083 --> 03:54.500
I changed my mind.

03:55.625 --> 03:56.541
I need you.

03:57.041 --> 04:00.666
That's flattering,
but, uh, I'm a little busy.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.916
You were never this daft before.

04:03.583 --> 04:04.666
Before?

04:05.333 --> 04:06.250
Just listen.

04:06.750 --> 04:07.958
I know where he is.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.833
I can take you right to him.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.375
You never run from a fight.

04:14.083 --> 04:19.125
You know where Slyrak is?
Fine, let the dragon sleep.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.500
You're the bravest man I've ever known,
no question.

04:23.125 --> 04:24.333
Until tonight.

04:24.416 --> 04:26.500
I never took you for a fool.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.541
You really know where Slyrak is?

04:32.625 --> 04:33.916
That's why I need you.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.083
In case you're wrong.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.750
In case I'm right.

04:38.916 --> 04:40.458
I'm gonna need my pants.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.750
Are you sure you don't want me along
on the rich lady dragon safari?

04:46.833 --> 04:49.833
Return to Dragon Hold.
Tell the Fathers what we found here.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.916
I'll join you by week's end,
Slyrak or no Slyrak.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Two Eldwurms in two days.

04:56.083 --> 04:59.333
Seems crazy and stupid, even for you.

04:59.416 --> 05:00.833
And your new friend is crazier.

05:01.625 --> 05:03.041
Looks like she can afford to be.

05:03.666 --> 05:04.708
Mm-hmm.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.375
Your father said
your presentation to the Althing

05:11.458 --> 05:13.208
was an overreaction.

05:13.291 --> 05:16.666
My father's opinion has evolved.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.583
He agrees, circumstances warrant
an audience with our Lady.

05:20.666 --> 05:22.291
All I ask is your blessing.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.583
I could simply go on my own, but…

05:25.666 --> 05:29.458
to disturb her without
an explicit invitation is a grave thing.

05:29.541 --> 05:31.708
I would say things are grave.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.708
I will bring a request to the Althing
for deep consideration.

05:36.791 --> 05:37.875
Thank you.

05:38.458 --> 05:41.583
In three days' time,
when the moon is highest in the sky.

05:42.291 --> 05:44.416
Three days? Your Excellency…

05:44.500 --> 05:45.458
Your Excellency.

05:46.958 --> 05:47.875
We need you.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.375
You should still be in worship.

05:50.458 --> 05:51.916
Our Lady dismissed us.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.875
She seemed confused, agitated,
as though she were under attack.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.500
As I was saying.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.000
Go.

06:00.791 --> 06:01.791
See to her.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.208
Praise the Moon of Mene.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.208
<i>Adara!</i>

06:16.291 --> 06:17.208
<i>Idwal!</i>

06:17.291 --> 06:18.125
<i>Dyfed!</i>

06:18.208 --> 06:19.541
<i>Adara!</i>

06:19.625 --> 06:20.958
<i>Idwal!</i>

06:21.041 --> 06:22.041
-<i>Dyfed!</i>
-Goddess?

06:22.125 --> 06:23.041
<i>Adara!</i>

06:23.125 --> 06:24.041
<i>Idwal!</i>

06:27.625 --> 06:28.500
Coedwig?

06:31.666 --> 06:32.750
Fascinating.

06:36.791 --> 06:38.166
-Goddess,

06:38.250 --> 06:40.000
I've come for guidance.

06:40.083 --> 06:43.250
I've discovered a source of arcane power
beyond anything--

06:43.333 --> 06:44.583
You don't belong here.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.458
You don't anywhere.

06:47.791 --> 06:50.625
I don't know you.
You're not from my enclave.

06:50.708 --> 06:51.833
Your enclave?

06:51.916 --> 06:54.708
You're not my family. Get out.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.375
Huh!

07:01.458 --> 07:05.666
Phantoms. Her illusions. How interesting.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.625
Dyfed!

07:07.208 --> 07:08.791
-Adara. Idwal.
-Goddess?

07:14.208 --> 07:16.375
-I'm here to help.

07:16.958 --> 07:17.791
Help me?

07:19.625 --> 07:22.333
I've come to kill you, demon.
Let's get on with it.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.208
Goddess, I love you.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.166
If you would take my life, take it.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.541
But I will not fight you.

07:32.833 --> 07:33.958
Filomena?

07:34.041 --> 07:36.125
You… You're not…

07:37.250 --> 07:38.250
Goddess?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.166
Goddess?

07:44.916 --> 07:47.416
So, I never run
from a fight, huh?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.583
You're not as mysterious
as you think.

07:49.666 --> 07:51.583
Underneath all the ego is…

07:51.666 --> 07:52.500
more ego.

07:52.583 --> 07:53.666
No.

07:53.750 --> 07:57.083
Well, yes. But, no, I…

07:57.166 --> 08:00.208
I'm used to ladies,
you know, recognizing me,

08:00.291 --> 08:02.291
even when I don't remember
their names, but…

08:02.375 --> 08:03.583
Charming.

08:03.666 --> 08:06.708
But I don't forget faces.

08:06.791 --> 08:08.541
And you act like you actually know me.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.125
Like we went through something.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.500
When we were kids, maybe.

08:14.291 --> 08:15.333
Unlikely.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.166
Good point.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.583
Maybe the night I slew
the wyrmling in The Hoven.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.125
I downed so many cups,

08:21.208 --> 08:23.708
I woke up in the middle of the forest
without my pants.

08:23.791 --> 08:26.625
You have quite the tempestuous
relationship with your pants.

08:26.708 --> 08:27.583
Yeah.

08:28.625 --> 08:29.791
My 21st birthday.

08:29.875 --> 08:32.333
After I won the Dragon's Fire
whiskey competition.

08:32.416 --> 08:34.083
It was none of those things.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.958
Nothing you'll ever remember.

08:38.125 --> 08:40.583
Just like the Dragon's Fire
whiskey competition.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.583
We met on the road.
You lost a wagon wheel.

08:45.666 --> 08:47.750
I eased it over the axle,
and then I hitched your--

08:47.833 --> 08:50.375
We met in a bar.

08:51.041 --> 08:53.250
I realize that hardly narrows it down.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.708
Just tell me.
I trusted you enough to come with you.

08:56.791 --> 08:58.458
It's really the least you could do--

08:59.833 --> 09:02.541
Dream gently, Dragon Knight.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.833
Weeping Rose? Nah, that wasn't it.

09:09.916 --> 09:10.833
Hold!

09:12.166 --> 09:13.333
State your business.

09:13.958 --> 09:17.916
I suppose that depends on why
you and your men are blocking the road.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.291
Your accent, sounds Helio to me.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.041
What of it?

09:22.125 --> 09:25.833
Our Lady's under attack.
We're to watch for spies and infiltrators.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.083
-It's to be war.
-War?

09:30.083 --> 09:31.750
-That's ridiculous.
-Maybe.

09:31.833 --> 09:34.000
We still need to check your packs
and carriages,

09:34.083 --> 09:36.833
or would you prefer an escort
to the Garrison

09:36.916 --> 09:38.916
for a more thorough inspection?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.083
Yeah. That's not happening.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.791
And who might you be?

09:42.875 --> 09:44.458
This is Dragon Knight business.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.083
The lady found an Eldwurm lair.

09:47.166 --> 09:50.166
So, move aside
or explain to your superiors

09:50.250 --> 09:52.250
how you interfered with a Dragon Knight

09:52.333 --> 09:54.958
and your people
lost my Order's protection forever.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.458
Dragon Knight?

09:57.208 --> 09:58.291
Move along then.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.833
Helio Imperium, huh?

10:09.166 --> 10:10.791
Thank you for what you did today.

10:11.291 --> 10:12.375
No need to thank me.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.750
Just tell me you're not a spy
or an infiltrator.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.791
I promise you I'm neither.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.500
But you are from The Helio Imperium.

10:20.583 --> 10:24.833
I get the feeling you're somebody
from The Helio Imperium.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.458
You really are somebody.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.083
And we met in a bar?

10:34.458 --> 10:35.750
I will explain.

10:36.791 --> 10:37.666
Someday.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.083
You know what? Fine.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.500
Right now, I'm just gonna take the win.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.625
Goodnight…

10:43.708 --> 10:44.791
Princess.

10:45.708 --> 10:48.041
What kind of princess hangs out in a bar?

10:49.916 --> 10:52.041
"A war," that soldier said.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.333
No. No. No, no, no.
That can't be my concern.

10:55.541 --> 10:58.791
If I can reach Slyrak,
if I speak with the Thunder,

10:58.875 --> 10:59.958
they will listen.

11:00.541 --> 11:01.416
They must.

11:03.458 --> 11:06.791
The wars of this new world
will be settled with the old.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.625
And yet…

11:09.708 --> 11:10.625
No.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.875
This is my purpose.

11:14.625 --> 11:15.958
I'm sure of it.

11:57.083 --> 11:57.958
Marci!

12:08.791 --> 12:09.708
Hey!

12:09.791 --> 12:10.708
Ugly!

12:11.375 --> 12:12.375
Let's go.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.125
Hell Bear.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.416
You can say that again.

13:00.208 --> 13:01.666
Never seen anything like it.

13:01.750 --> 13:04.875
What I mean, is, it's called a Hell Bear.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.750
Where I come from, they're everywhere.

13:06.833 --> 13:07.875
Get the horses.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.208
Gods damn it. No. Wait!

13:10.291 --> 13:11.666
Get out of here!

13:11.750 --> 13:13.791
Don't stop them. Let them go.

13:14.291 --> 13:15.208
They're terrified.

13:15.708 --> 13:18.000
That thing killed almost everyone.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.500
Maybe not everyone.

13:23.666 --> 13:24.958
I don't see anything.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.208
We're coming!

13:31.291 --> 13:32.250
Hold on!

13:34.625 --> 13:35.958
By the Dawn Star.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.708
It's the trees.

13:41.041 --> 13:43.541
That seems bad.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.458
Nice shot.

14:54.041 --> 14:56.875
I don't suppose they have this
where you come from.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.083
The acolytes feared you were under attack.

15:04.708 --> 15:08.750
Child, you should not have come here.
No one should come here.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.875
I… I am not myself.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.041
You are in need, Goddess.

15:14.583 --> 15:15.916
Allow me to serve you.

15:16.625 --> 15:20.541
The phantoms.
Tell me about the children, their song.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.916
I don't know.
I… I can't make sense of any of it.

15:24.416 --> 15:25.958
The Air Dragon?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.416
I've never encountered one.

15:28.041 --> 15:29.083
Curious.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.125
Dyfed. Adara. Idwal.

15:32.708 --> 15:36.791
I felt their love for you, yours for them.
They must mean something to you.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.375
I don't know them at all.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.166
I know all of my children,

15:40.250 --> 15:41.500
but I don't know them.

15:42.166 --> 15:46.083
They could simply be the last
three worshippers who prayed to you.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.208
But your mind, it manifested them.

15:49.708 --> 15:53.125
The children and the dragon as more.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.416
Projections, as in a dream.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.291
It's more than a dream.

15:57.375 --> 15:58.833
It's beyond reason.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.750
The horror, the pain.

16:00.833 --> 16:02.208
-It's alive.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.583
It's inside me.

16:04.208 --> 16:07.125
Goddess,
I believe the breaking of the moon

16:07.208 --> 16:09.333
and your phantoms are connected.

16:09.416 --> 16:12.625
If we can establish
the true chain of causality…

16:12.708 --> 16:13.708
Please.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.541
-Go now.

16:16.291 --> 16:18.916
Pray for me, for yourself, for us all.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.416
But, Goddess, I can solve this.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.416
-Out!

16:26.791 --> 16:27.875
Cochi.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.916
My jailer returns.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.291
After all these eons.

16:47.083 --> 16:51.416
I thought, perhaps, you had forgotten.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.958
I know how to fix this,
but no one will let me.

16:56.041 --> 16:58.916
I can't let this go. The result could be…

16:59.000 --> 16:59.875
Oh.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.083
Tell my father?

17:02.166 --> 17:03.916
No.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.250
Father will be furious with me.

17:06.333 --> 17:10.250
"Filomena, listen. Filomena, obey."

17:10.833 --> 17:11.708
Hm.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.333
You're right. There's no time for this.

17:14.916 --> 17:17.625
I will talk. He will listen. Now.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.083
Show me Father.

17:20.541 --> 17:24.500
And not a whisper to him that I've learned
to use his pools this way.

17:27.500 --> 17:32.875
I reimagined a universe
so you could perform this one task.

17:32.958 --> 17:37.208
Yet, here you are, overpowered, broken.

17:37.291 --> 17:41.916
I never considered
they might end their battle to kill me.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.666
It seems I did unite them in the end.

17:45.500 --> 17:49.000
For all your claims, you are still a fool.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.416
We are both fools.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.458
Where is he?

17:53.083 --> 17:54.333
Who is that creature?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.041
Wait.

17:56.125 --> 17:57.250
The moon.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.875
He's inside the moon.

17:59.791 --> 18:02.458
I will channel
what remains of your energies

18:02.541 --> 18:04.541
for a more useful purpose.

18:05.541 --> 18:08.916
And pacify what you could not contain.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.291
Ancients!

18:14.208 --> 18:17.958
You will be at peace.

18:34.500 --> 18:38.791
The self will not be extinguished!

19:22.291 --> 19:23.291
Papa.

19:42.666 --> 19:44.125
What are you?

19:44.208 --> 19:45.833
Explain yourselves!

19:45.916 --> 19:49.416
We are the mind
divided against itself.

19:49.500 --> 19:54.000
I am the unity that binds the Fragments.

19:54.083 --> 19:58.625
And you are a stray thought,
a memory, imagined.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.375
Forgotten soon.

20:12.916 --> 20:14.916
I have you. You're safe.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.250
The moon…

20:17.250 --> 20:19.625
His destruction cannot be stopped.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.333
The end is inevitable.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.500
I failed you again.

20:26.708 --> 20:30.250
You've never failed me in your life,
and you never will.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.041
Nor I, you.

20:32.583 --> 20:34.958
You must trust me now, Father.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.791
I will find all of the answers.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.333
Filomena, I beg you.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.666
Oh, sleep.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.750
Okay.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.625
You're gonna tell me
what in the Seven Hells is going on,

20:53.708 --> 20:54.958
or I am gone.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.541
We need to press on.

20:56.625 --> 20:58.500
You know too many things.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.333
Things you have no good reason to know.

21:01.416 --> 21:03.333
Sometimes
it's better not to know.

21:03.916 --> 21:06.083
Not good enough. Try again.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.083
You want answers?

21:09.708 --> 21:12.375
All right, I'll tell you what I know.

21:13.333 --> 21:17.000
I know this came from the wyrmling
that destroyed your village.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.250
I know you were just a boy,
and you ran to fight with your father.

21:22.333 --> 21:23.958
You watched him die.

21:24.041 --> 21:26.500
I know you found your mother
buried in the ashes.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.083
You don't run from a fight,

21:29.166 --> 21:31.166
and it's not because
you're a Dragon Knight.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.666
You don't run because you're Davion.

21:38.458 --> 21:39.958
You're on your own.

21:40.041 --> 21:41.375
Where I knew you,

21:42.125 --> 21:46.500
we knew each other in ways
that we knew each other.

21:46.583 --> 21:50.625
Look, all of this is wrong.
It's coming apart, and we have to fix it.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.083
Slyrak can help us.

21:52.666 --> 21:54.041
Slyrak?

21:54.750 --> 21:57.458
An Eldwurm that exists
only to kill and destroy.

21:57.541 --> 21:58.458
He can help?

21:58.541 --> 22:00.708
Dragons are not what you think.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.958
He and I and-- and you…

22:04.958 --> 22:06.500
we have a connection.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.083
Look, it's complicated.

22:09.750 --> 22:10.916
I don't like liars.

22:11.625 --> 22:15.000
And I don't risk my life
for people crazier than I am,

22:15.083 --> 22:17.166
which you definitely fucking are.

22:33.625 --> 22:34.750
Hm.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.583
No, it's best he left.

22:57.666 --> 22:58.916
It's best I do this alone.

22:59.750 --> 23:02.458
And I do mean alone.

23:03.041 --> 23:04.791
Marci, you can't come with me.

23:09.541 --> 23:11.666
Look, Slyrak may not be as I remember him,

23:11.750 --> 23:14.166
and I cannot put you in harm's way,
not again.

23:19.416 --> 23:21.666
Now, whatever happens,

23:21.750 --> 23:23.666
you must know, I'm sorry.

23:49.833 --> 23:50.916
Kaden.

23:51.958 --> 23:54.125
Who in the Third Hell are you?

23:54.208 --> 23:55.375
A… A friend.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
Look, I'm sorry, but I cannot allow you
to slay that dragon.

24:00.083 --> 24:03.333
You don't know what this animal
is capable of or how many he's killed.

24:03.416 --> 24:06.416
But I know very well what he's capable of.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.583
Far more than you're aware.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.166
Tell me about it when he's dead.

24:14.125 --> 24:15.375
That was a mistake.

24:16.041 --> 24:17.208
There's no time.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.041
I'm not here to argue.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.416
It won't take long.
