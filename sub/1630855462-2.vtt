WEBVTT

00:00.267 --> 00:01.668
for once, I agree with Gizmo.

00:01.702 --> 00:04.505
You do overuse
the vampiric hypnosis.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.540
-What? And you don't?
-I don't need to.

00:06.573 --> 00:10.310
I can rely on my wit and wisdom,
not cheap tricks and gambits.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.045
Electrical audio recording.

00:12.079 --> 00:14.715
Testing. One, two and...

00:14.748 --> 00:17.084
My point being,
I can wander about these humans

00:17.117 --> 00:19.086
without having
to resort to hypnosis.

00:19.119 --> 00:21.355
I'm a student
of the human condition,

00:21.388 --> 00:23.590
a psychological chameleon,
one might say.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.692
Well, one might also say

00:25.726 --> 00:29.029
that you have hypnotized your
best friend Sean many times.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.431
Yeah, to clear up your mess,
but I don't say anything

00:31.465 --> 00:34.268
that causes Sean
any kind of alarm.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.003
In fact, if you talk to Sean,
he'll tell you

00:36.036 --> 00:38.238
I'm just one of the guys.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.540
Well, he's my friend, too.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.241
That's 'cause he's a nice guy,

00:41.275 --> 00:42.442
which makes it
doubly embarrassing

00:42.476 --> 00:44.311
when you say dumb shit like,

00:44.344 --> 00:47.781
"I am a vampire,
I've lived for 2,000 years.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.550
"I like to suck-a the blood.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.251
"Oh, shit. I fucked up.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.188
I'll now have to hypnotize
the whole fucking world."

00:55.522 --> 00:57.591
-I don't do that.
-You do do that.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.359
You just said "Doo doo."

00:59.393 --> 01:03.430
Touché.
Can we get on with this?

[Nadja]
I am not imagining anything.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.237
Something is going very tits up
with my life.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.139
-In what ways?
-I don't know, Colin Robinson.

01:46.173 --> 01:49.042
How about, my nightclub
got destroyed by fire?

01:49.076 --> 01:51.545
-Which you set.
-I was drinking

01:51.578 --> 01:54.314
liquor blood every day
for months.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.517
I know, my darling, but we did
all tell you to slow down.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.485
-Slow down.
-We did tell you to slow down.
-[Nadja] And no one,

01:58.519 --> 02:00.320
none of you told me
to slow down!

02:00.354 --> 02:04.024
-Uh...
-And now, my poor,
precious little dolly

02:04.057 --> 02:06.260
has got her body all mangled
and minced up.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.062
You did that by sitting on me.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.998
While you were drunk
on liquor blood.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.666
After we told you to slow down.

02:12.699 --> 02:16.003
-Yes.
-This is never going to end.
[cries]

02:16.036 --> 02:18.505
Now, now, Nadja. There, there.
It is going to end.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.274
And I have just the thing
that's going to help you.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.377
Don't tell me, Nandor. Hypnosis.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.611
Uh...

02:24.645 --> 02:26.180
Hypnosis seems
to be Nandor's solution

02:26.213 --> 02:27.748
to every problem.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.250
And as a fellow vampire,
I find this artless,

02:30.284 --> 02:32.786
and even embarrassing.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.356
You plan to hypnotize my wife
free of all her woes?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.258
-No, actually.
-Really?

02:38.292 --> 02:40.527
What was it then?

02:40.561 --> 02:42.429
You know what?
The atmosphere in this room...

02:42.462 --> 02:44.364
-Hey...
-...is not really conducive
to positive

02:44.398 --> 02:45.732
contributions,
so just forget it.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.502
[rumbling]

02:51.805 --> 02:53.640
-Surprise!
-[gasping]

02:53.674 --> 02:55.475
I'm back.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.178
-Were you gone?
-Yes.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.479
I was gone for a while.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.082
I have been
sitting over there

03:02.115 --> 03:04.251
at the Vampiric Council
headquarters

03:04.284 --> 03:07.154
wondering if you guys were going
to come back.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.655
After a while, I just decided,

03:08.689 --> 03:11.124
"Maybe they forgot
I even exist!"

03:11.158 --> 03:13.627
[laughs softly]

03:13.660 --> 03:15.696
Says here we're on track

03:15.729 --> 03:19.600
for a higher than usual level
of precipitation this month.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.468
-[Nandor] No doubt.
-Mm.

03:21.502 --> 03:25.138
So, what did I miss?

03:25.172 --> 03:27.774
What's the old gang
been up to, huh?

03:27.808 --> 03:31.044
Actually, I'm going to sit
in that chair in a few minutes.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.647
No problemo.
It's more comfortable over here.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.350
Any fun activities planned
for tonight?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.051
Yes, we're off
for a night on the town

03:38.085 --> 03:40.120
-with Sean and his friends.
-Ha, ha!

03:40.153 --> 03:43.123
Is this like a
"Come one, come all" type deal?

03:43.156 --> 03:44.992
Uh, not sure.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.593
I'll give you a ring
when I get there.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.428
-All right.
-[door creaks open]

03:48.462 --> 03:50.063
-But you don't have a phone.
-[door closes]

03:50.097 --> 03:51.598
That was weird, right?

03:51.632 --> 03:54.401
I know it's hard
to break into a vampire clique.

03:54.434 --> 03:57.204
Oh, no. What happened
to your little body?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.540
-She sat on me.
-No.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.576
They've never invited me
to live in the house.

04:02.609 --> 04:06.246
Apparently, they are not allowed
to have a fifth vampire here,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.283
due to some zoning regulation

04:09.316 --> 04:11.251
that I have never heard of.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.323
[Sean] I was never much

04:16.356 --> 04:17.658
of a wine guy
when I was younger.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.659
-Same.
-But that's 'cause

04:18.692 --> 04:19.660
we were drinking to get drunk.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.695
Now that we're older,

04:21.728 --> 04:25.032
you know, you can appreciate
the concept of moderation.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.500
Or Charmaine told you
you better start appreciating it

04:26.533 --> 04:28.168
if you don't want
to keep sleeping

04:28.202 --> 04:29.636
on an army cot in the garage.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.505
-Come on.
-Whoa. Why you got
to bring that up?

04:31.538 --> 04:34.675
Wine can of their wits
the wise beguile,

04:34.708 --> 04:38.512
make a sage frolic,
and the serious smile.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.614
Whoa! We got a fucking poet
over here.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.616
Classic Laz.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.318
[Laszlo]
Now I'd like to claim that
as my own,

04:44.351 --> 04:46.286
it was actually written
a long time ago by Homer.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.621
[Frank]
Oh. Homer's great.

04:47.654 --> 04:50.057
-Yeah. D'oh!
-Yeah. D'oh.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.558
-[chuckling]
-Yes!

04:51.592 --> 04:54.294
Wine is very cool.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.129
Um...

04:56.163 --> 04:58.499
That was... Nandor.

04:58.532 --> 05:02.202
-Hmm.
-Oh, me. But seriously,

05:02.236 --> 05:04.004
yeah, how come you guys
never drink?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.273
I mean, I don't think I've ever
seen you guys take a sip

05:06.306 --> 05:08.041
of nothing ever.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.210
-Uh...
-Never?

05:10.244 --> 05:12.145
-No?
-No.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.480
[Sean]
What's up with that?

05:13.514 --> 05:17.017
Actually, uh,
I drink lots of fluids.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.087
-Oh.
-Red fluids.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.656
If Nandor were to engage his
brain just once before speaking,

05:22.689 --> 05:25.425
he would not fall back
on hypnosis.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.528
Much like your wine.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.298
-Except it is not wine.
-[Frank] Hmm.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.267
Okay.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.135
-What is it then?
-Um...
-Um...

05:35.169 --> 05:37.237
I don't know why I said that.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.039
[Laszlo]
A real vampire uses

05:39.072 --> 05:41.141
wit, wisdom and charm.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.377
What he's trying to say is,
um, he's more

05:43.410 --> 05:45.479
of a Red Bull and vodka guy.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.613
-Oh!
-Oh!
-Oh!

05:46.647 --> 05:48.382
-Yeah.
-Yes, yes.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.450
The reason
you don't see us drinking is,

05:50.484 --> 05:53.253
'cause we pre-gamed
before we got here very heavily.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.422
There you go.
Budget conscious.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.257
And you never see us
eat anything

05:57.291 --> 05:59.059
'cause I don't want
what's going down there

05:59.092 --> 06:02.062
to come back up here
and across your stupid faces.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.332
-[laughter]
-Yeah!

06:05.365 --> 06:07.067
See? Little charm goes
a long way.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.570
That was close.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.572
[Nadja]
And on top of this

06:11.605 --> 06:14.541
bag of shit things
that keep happening to me,

06:14.575 --> 06:17.544
I've got no one
to talk to about it.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.346
I am here.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.715
Yes, yes,
but you know what I mean.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.318
I have got absolutely

06:24.351 --> 06:28.021
no really close
female friends anymore.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.590
None?

06:29.623 --> 06:31.758
Nope. Go figure.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.660
[Guide] I just felt like

06:33.694 --> 06:35.295
we had gotten closer

06:35.329 --> 06:37.164
with the nightclub
and everything,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.633
and... [sighs]

06:39.666 --> 06:42.102
So you're telling me

06:42.135 --> 06:45.506
you have no close
female friends?

06:45.539 --> 06:48.108
None at all.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.313
What do I got to do? [laughs]

06:53.347 --> 06:55.282
[sighs]

06:55.315 --> 06:57.284
It's got an ass-load of terroir.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.119
-What the fuck do you know,
terroir?
-What do you mean?

06:59.152 --> 07:01.255
Nandor, uh, I don't know
whether you've noticed,

07:01.288 --> 07:04.224
but Gizmo seems
a bit odd lately.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.726
Yeah, I mean,
he's been a bit distant lately,

07:05.759 --> 07:07.361
but I think it's because

07:07.394 --> 07:09.263
I haven't given him
enough shit work.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.697
You know what it's like
with familiars.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.733
If you don't give them
enough shit work,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.368
then they have too much time

07:14.401 --> 07:16.537
to contemplate
their own pathetic existences.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.305
I think
it might be something else.

07:18.338 --> 07:21.775
I have a theory, but I could
just be imagining things.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.244
[Guillermo]
I don't understand
what's taking so long.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.079
How long did it take when
you were made into a vampire

07:26.113 --> 07:28.515
to fully, you know,
become a vampire?

07:28.549 --> 07:30.384
For me it was, like,
six to eight hours,

07:30.417 --> 07:33.387
but as with all things,
your mileage may vary.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.022
It's been three weeks.
Why am I not a vampire?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.757
-I should be a vampire by now.
-Maybe you are one,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.158
and you just don't realize it.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.327
Okay, hang on.
Have you tried this?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.530
Form of... Microchiroptera.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.399
[squeaking]

07:45.432 --> 07:48.268
-[gasps]
-No.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.204
I can't do that. If I could
do that, I wouldn't be here.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.605
-Have you tried?
-Yes, of course, I've tried.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.140
Try now.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.376
Okay.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.378
Bat.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.549
Whoa! That is some freaky shit.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.384
-[Man] Hey, Derek?
-Toilets!

08:04.418 --> 08:06.053
-It's overflowing.
-Yeah, um, I've got to...

08:06.086 --> 08:07.754
Hold that thought.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.456
-[man] Derek!
-Coming!

08:17.731 --> 08:20.300
I think
I have everything we need.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.035
For what?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.437
All these troubles
you're having--

08:23.470 --> 08:25.472
I hate to say it,
but I think it might be...

08:25.506 --> 08:27.040
a hex.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.243
Do you mean, like, a curse?

08:29.276 --> 08:33.113
No, no, curses are just
supernatural excuses

08:33.146 --> 08:35.349
people make up for being losers.

08:35.382 --> 08:38.352
Hexes, on the other hand--
that's a real thing.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.622
Targeted harassment brought on
by your own past actions.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.024
-Right.
-Let's just rule it out.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.426
Is there anyone in your life,

08:46.460 --> 08:50.097
current or past,
that you have treated unkindly?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.565
-Nope.
-No one?

08:51.598 --> 08:53.167
-No.
-Never?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.434
-No.
-No one?

08:54.468 --> 08:55.736
Nope.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.306
-Oh, that's the way.
-Please stop fucking doing that.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.707
-Why? Why?
-What's wrong with you?

09:00.741 --> 09:03.043
Hey, hey, hey, hey, boys.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.612
Why don't we just play nice?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.447
No, it's bullshit.

09:07.481 --> 09:11.051
That's a fucking
eight-dollar bottle of wine,

09:11.084 --> 09:12.619
and he's putting ice in it!

09:12.653 --> 09:15.389
That's what they do in France!

09:15.422 --> 09:18.425
-Come on. Marone.
-Easy now, fellows.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.227
Mikey's right.
That is what they do in France.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.430
What the fuck do you know
from fucking France?

09:23.463 --> 09:26.166
Oh! My cousin is from France.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.702
Your cousin is
from fucking Quebec!

09:28.735 --> 09:31.171
-How dare you.
-But I'm right, ain't I?

09:31.205 --> 09:32.606
-Ain't I? Huh?
-Quit doing the fucking
chin thing.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.208
-Fuck you.
-Get the fuck out of--

09:34.241 --> 09:36.577
-[clamoring]
-[Laszlo laughs]
-[woman] Hey... stop it!

09:36.610 --> 09:38.178
-Stop it!
-Shouldn't we, uh...?

09:38.212 --> 09:40.080
No, I think
let them just carry on.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.749
-They're having a great time.
-[Mikey] You know, I think

09:42.783 --> 09:44.184
Céline Dion is from Quebec.

09:44.218 --> 09:45.185
-[indistinct shouting]
-[Laszlo] Céline who?

09:45.219 --> 09:46.587
Céline Dion.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.055
I don't know who she is.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.624
-Vegas showgirl, singer type.
-Is she good?

09:50.657 --> 09:53.026
Fucking bring it!

09:53.060 --> 09:55.062
-[woman shrieks]
-Fuck you!

09:55.095 --> 09:57.164
-That's not good.
-No it's not.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.599
That's not good at all.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.767
All right,
nothing to see here, everyone.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.503
-Maybe we should,
uh, skedaddle.
-Yeah.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.304
-Whoops.
-You really got me.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.707
-Oh.
-Sorry for the ruckus, Jimmy.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.642
-[woman] Not my name.
-We'll get this cleaned up

10:08.675 --> 10:11.044
and squared away in no time.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.614
I think
she's calling the police.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.582
Why don't you hypnotize them,
Nandor? You're so fond of that.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.317
I don't think
that will be necessary.

10:17.351 --> 10:19.520
Maybe you fellas
should apologize to Jimmy.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.455
-Not my name.
-[Sean] Sorry, Jimmy.
-And offer

10:21.488 --> 10:22.489
-to pay for the window.
-Yo!

10:22.523 --> 10:24.091
-Shit.
-Who the fuck's

10:24.124 --> 10:26.493
-this bonanza?
-Oh, go, go, go!

10:26.527 --> 10:28.729
-What's going on here, fellas?
-Officer, thank goodness.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.631
This window-- it exploded,

10:30.664 --> 10:33.333
and it nearly blew the asses
off these guys.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.336
-What guys?
-These guys. The, uh...

10:36.370 --> 10:38.105
Uh...

10:38.138 --> 10:40.040
-You need some help?
-[Nandor] No, I got this.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.176
There were these guys.
This much we know.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.044
But there was also this window,

10:44.077 --> 10:46.213
-and the, uh...
-Mikey?

10:46.246 --> 10:49.249
-I...
-Oh, fuck off, Terry.
It was an accident.

10:49.283 --> 10:51.585
Whatever, Mikey.
I'm filing a report.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.787
Hold on there. Do you two fellas
know each other?

10:53.820 --> 10:56.056
Yeah, Terry, Seany,

10:56.089 --> 10:58.025
Frank and I-- we all went
to high school together.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.561
Oh, so this is Terry?
These fellas-- they speak

11:00.594 --> 11:02.196
very highly of you.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.431
-This guy?
Get the fuck out of here.
-No.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.233
It's absolutely true.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.235
I've waited a long time

11:08.268 --> 11:11.038
to meet the world-famous
Terry from high school.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.506
And now I have,
and I'll tell you something.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.575
I'm not disappointed.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.310
-For real?
-Oh, yes.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.511
-Shit. That's good.
-Just a bit of charm.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.179
And I'll wager

11:19.213 --> 11:21.348
not many constables could think
of a creative way out

11:21.381 --> 11:23.617
of this particular predicament,

11:23.650 --> 11:25.252
and that's because
they're not Terry.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.355
[both laughing]

11:28.388 --> 11:30.190
Sean, I don't know
what you're doing down there,

11:30.224 --> 11:32.059
but it doesn't look
like a good idea.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.162
Hey, Terry, see you next fall.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.296
-Come on, book it. Let's go.
-Shit.

11:36.330 --> 11:38.465
-All right.
-Eat shit and die, Terry.
-[siren wailing]

11:38.499 --> 11:40.467
-[laughing]
-[Nandor] Where did you get
those chains?

11:40.501 --> 11:42.102
-From the car.
-What car?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.637
-Right over here!
-Here.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.173
Get in, losers!
We're going shopping!

11:46.206 --> 11:49.243
No, no, no, no, no,
don't steal my car!

11:49.276 --> 11:51.445
You stole my car back in school!

11:51.478 --> 11:53.180
You sold me that piece of shit!

11:53.213 --> 11:56.183
-Drive on, motherfuckers.
-[horn honking]

11:56.216 --> 11:58.385
-[tires screeching]
-[siren wailing]

11:58.418 --> 12:00.521
[horn blaring]

12:00.554 --> 12:03.056
[indistinct shouting]

12:03.090 --> 12:04.558
[Sean] [over megaphone]
Eat shit, Terry!

12:04.591 --> 12:06.560
[laughter over megaphone]

12:10.531 --> 12:12.299
Am I needed for this bit,

12:12.332 --> 12:14.301
or can I just take a nap
while you do your--

12:14.334 --> 12:15.302
Shh! Honestly.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.571
It's this way?

12:17.604 --> 12:20.174
Is it this way?
I'm listening.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.608
No, no. Oh.

12:21.642 --> 12:23.343
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

12:23.377 --> 12:26.213
It's here.
[gasps loudly, yells]

12:26.246 --> 12:29.116
[gasps]

12:29.149 --> 12:31.451
-Is this yours?
-No,

12:31.485 --> 12:33.787
but, no, I know this woman.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.723
This is Yiaya Neikia.
In Antipaxos,

12:36.757 --> 12:39.026
this is a very bad-luck woman.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.427
A real shit-stirrer.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.764
How did this get here?

12:43.797 --> 12:46.099
[blows]
That ought to do it.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.334
[Guide clears throat]

12:47.367 --> 12:48.735
Oh, my.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.737
What?!

12:50.771 --> 12:52.506
Oh.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.174
This shriveled bitch!

12:54.208 --> 12:55.342
[ripping photo]

12:57.511 --> 12:59.646
Now that really ought
to do it. [laughs]

12:59.680 --> 13:02.049
Um...

13:02.082 --> 13:04.184
-Oh, my...
-[Nadja] What?!

13:04.218 --> 13:05.419
[panting]

13:07.554 --> 13:09.656
Ew-kay. [chuckles]

13:09.690 --> 13:12.659
This is a little bit
really bad, isn't it?

13:20.801 --> 13:22.636
[Lazlo]
Didn't feel a thing.

13:22.669 --> 13:23.637
[Sean]
Think I went out of bounds.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.039
-[coughing]
-Jesus.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.708
[Sean]
Everybody good?

13:27.741 --> 13:30.377
-Holy shit.
-Hey, look, I didn't even
spill my wine.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.647
-Nice.
-That was some GTA5 shit.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.516
Yo, yo, Mikey, Mikey,
you got a little cut.

13:35.549 --> 13:37.384
That's gonna be a good scar
in the morning.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.785
-Yeah. Go ahead.
-[Laszlo] Say, boys.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.420
I've got a great idea.

13:40.454 --> 13:43.690
What say we... call it a night?

13:43.724 --> 13:46.426
[Nandor]
Laszlo makes a good point.
Maybe we should all just

13:46.460 --> 13:49.029
-go home and go to bed?
-[Mikey] Oh! Look what I found!

13:49.062 --> 13:51.031
-Look what I found.
-Oh!
-Oh!

13:51.064 --> 13:53.300
-Nice!
-Breaker 1-9, Breaker 1-9.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.102
This is Rubber Duck.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.436
-That's a good reference.
-Yeah.

13:56.470 --> 13:57.571
-10-4, yeah.
-[Frank] That's nothing.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.039
Look what I found.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.674
-Whoa.
-[laughs]

14:00.707 --> 14:02.109
[Laszlo] Why don't you
put that back in the car?

14:02.142 --> 14:03.277
[Sean]
Laz is right.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.012
We got to tell Terry about that.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.047
Cop's not supposed
to lose his gun.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.715
It's real bad.
I saw it in a movie once.

14:08.749 --> 14:10.784
Yeah, we should leave the gun,

14:10.817 --> 14:13.053
-go home and go to bed.
-[Sean] Empty the bullets,
dipshit.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.722
You know, that's a felony--
to have a loaded weapon?

14:15.756 --> 14:18.158
-[gunshots]
-[clamoring]

14:18.192 --> 14:19.293
Very loud.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.761
What the fuck are you doing?

14:20.794 --> 14:21.762
You told me
to get rid of the bullets.

14:21.795 --> 14:25.165
-I said, empty the clip!
-That's what I'm doing!

14:25.199 --> 14:27.167
-[siren wailing]
-See? Now it's empty,

14:27.201 --> 14:29.036
-idiot.
-[Sean] Oh, shit.
Terry snitched.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.305
-Oh. Shit.
-We got to hit the bricks.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.408
Go, go, go.
Come on, boys, let's go!

14:34.441 --> 14:37.311
[siren wailing]

14:37.344 --> 14:39.012
You're not coming?

14:39.046 --> 14:40.581
Well, if you want
to be a coward, Nandor.

14:40.614 --> 14:42.783
-[cop] Freeze!
-[cop 2] Put your hands up.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.551
-Hands where we can see them.
-Uh, no, not really.
I just thought maybe

14:44.585 --> 14:46.186
it's what you wanted to do. Hi.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.421
-Shit. There's a lot of them.
-Stay there, stay there.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.056
-Evening.
-Evening, gentlemen.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.457
I'm sure you're wondering

14:50.491 --> 14:52.759
what are those two chaps doing
with one of our cars?

14:52.793 --> 14:54.661
Firstly, there were these guys.

14:54.695 --> 14:56.029
-Ah.
-This much we know.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.099
But, also,
there was this window.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.435
Uh...

15:01.468 --> 15:03.437
-Nandor, would you mind
if I dealt with this?
-Would you?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.405
Now, tell me something, fellas.

15:05.439 --> 15:09.443
Is it true what they say
about Staten Island policemen?

15:09.476 --> 15:11.445
-[lock buzzes]
-[door clangs]

15:11.478 --> 15:14.448
-Well.
-Well.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.518
-You tried.
-Yup.

15:17.551 --> 15:20.120
Not one of my finest moments.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.455
I think
this could be a situation

15:21.488 --> 15:23.423
where hypnosis is warranted.

15:23.457 --> 15:25.225
I think you're right.

15:25.259 --> 15:27.261
Go ahead.

15:28.729 --> 15:30.564
No, well, you see,
there's a problem there.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.633
Um...

15:32.666 --> 15:34.434
I'm not very good at hypnosis.

15:34.468 --> 15:36.637
Sorry. I didn't catch that.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.305
I said, I'm not very good
at hypnosis.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.573
I never have been good at it,

15:39.606 --> 15:41.441
and I don't think
I ever will be.

15:41.475 --> 15:44.311
-Nonsense.
-Well, it's not.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.447
I mean, I can hypnotize Sean,
but only with your help.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.449
And only
'cause his brain's fucked.

15:49.483 --> 15:53.453
I should also admit that I've
been envious of your skills,

15:53.487 --> 15:56.690
which I think is the reason why
I take the piss out of you.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.692
Much as it pains me to say this,

15:58.725 --> 16:01.295
if anyone can get us out
of this situation, Nandor,

16:01.328 --> 16:02.329
I think it will be you.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.299
Okay, then.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.702
I will fix.

So...

16:14.141 --> 16:17.144
I am hexed, which...
is not great.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.680
There is writing
on the hex picture,

16:19.713 --> 16:21.582
but I haven't read
the Antipaxon language

16:21.615 --> 16:23.116
in hundreds of years, so...

16:27.287 --> 16:29.156

16:29.189 --> 16:31.558
Could you maybe help translate
this picture

16:31.592 --> 16:33.026
-using your gray box?
-Sure.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.429
[Nadja]
So I had to get Colin Robinson

16:35.462 --> 16:37.264
to help me translate
on his computer machine.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.300
And he told me something,
which, quite frankly,

16:40.334 --> 16:42.436
blew my mind apart.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.771
Or you could just walk down
to Little Antipaxos

16:44.805 --> 16:47.007
and have someone translate it
for you.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.643
Wh-Which? There is
a Little Antipaxos? What?

16:49.676 --> 16:52.145
Oh, yeah, not too far from here,

16:52.179 --> 16:54.114
just above Little Italy.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.650
That's the great melting pot
of America for you.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.319
-The broad mosaic.
-No, no, shut up.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.455
Are you saying
there is a Little Antipaxos

17:01.488 --> 17:03.190
right here on Staten Island?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.159
It's only, like,
a four-block-by-two-block area,

17:05.192 --> 17:07.161

It is where all the Antipaxons

17:28.348 --> 17:30.317
who come to America work
and live

17:30.350 --> 17:31.518
and laugh and love.

17:31.552 --> 17:32.519
I'm Nadja.

Three for joy.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.660
Look!
This is the beach of Voutoumi!

17:39.693 --> 17:42.563
I tried to lose my virginity
here so many times.

17:42.596 --> 17:44.531
Souvlaki. Stifado!

17:44.565 --> 17:46.300
The food of my youth!

17:46.333 --> 17:48.368
Of course
the Greeks stole it from us,

17:48.402 --> 17:49.503
and claimed it as their own,

17:49.536 --> 17:51.305
but the real heads know

17:51.338 --> 17:53.040
that it originally came
from Antipaxos.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.175
[both speak Greek]

17:55.209 --> 17:57.277
I mean, it would be wrong
not to just try a little bit.

17:57.311 --> 18:00.180
Mmm.

18:00.214 --> 18:03.050
[loud retching]

18:03.083 --> 18:05.319
[gurgles, coughs]

18:05.352 --> 18:06.553
So worth it.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.021
You can still sell that,
I think.

18:08.055 --> 18:09.122
[laughs]
Thank you.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.525
Oh, this place. [sniffs]

18:11.558 --> 18:12.993
[grunts]

18:13.026 --> 18:14.428
How fucking long
have we lived here,

18:14.461 --> 18:16.630
and you never thought to tell me

18:16.663 --> 18:18.165
there was a
Little Antipaxos neighborhood,

18:18.198 --> 18:20.033
like, half a mile
from our house?!

18:20.067 --> 18:21.235
You never asked.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.402
[speaks Greek]

18:24.471 --> 18:26.173
Oh, look.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.442
A shitty diner just like
my theía used to run.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.143
Come on.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.256
What did he say?
What did he say?

18:42.289 --> 18:44.558
It is an Antipaxon thing.

18:44.591 --> 18:48.529
[speaking Greek]

18:48.562 --> 18:51.431
-What does the writing say?
-Oh, um,

18:51.465 --> 18:54.034
she says it says, "A simple act

18:54.067 --> 18:56.770
"of kindness, compassion
and friendship

18:56.803 --> 19:00.040
will remove the hexes

[laughter]

19:10.050 --> 19:11.318
What, what?

19:11.351 --> 19:12.553
Oh, it's very complicated.

19:12.586 --> 19:15.055
I-I don't think
you can understand.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.157
[Nadja laughs]

19:17.191 --> 19:19.760
[owl hooting]

19:19.793 --> 19:24.431
No, I cannot say
I have heard of this before.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.401
-This fellow you speak of.
-Derek. Derek's friend.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.502
-[Derek] Uh, you wouldn't
have met him.
-Yeah,

19:28.535 --> 19:30.304
-because he lives in Canada.
-Yes.

19:30.337 --> 19:35.042
Ah. So, he was turned
into a vampire

19:35.075 --> 19:38.545
by a vampire,
but does not yet seem

19:38.579 --> 19:41.048
to be a vampire?

19:41.081 --> 19:42.316
Yeah, that's about the size
of it, yeah.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.418
But, um, does that happen?

19:44.451 --> 19:45.686
Uh... uh...

19:45.719 --> 19:48.555
[speaking native language]

19:52.593 --> 19:54.461
[speaking native language]

19:59.032 --> 20:00.167
Neither of us have ever heard
of such a thing.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.002
-Mm.
-Mm. Okay.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.670
[speaking native language]

20:07.341 --> 20:10.377
Oh. Could work, I suppose.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.045
-What could work?
-He says maybe

20:12.079 --> 20:16.316
repeat the turning process
with a different vampire.

20:16.350 --> 20:19.319
Of course, that could make
your friend a vampire-and-a-half

20:19.353 --> 20:21.255
or a double vampire,

20:21.288 --> 20:23.023
but who gives a shit?
I don't know this freak.

20:23.056 --> 20:26.260
[laughter]

20:26.293 --> 20:29.096
Let us see what happens
when you turn a vampire twice.

20:29.129 --> 20:31.098
Jonathan is my neighbor.

20:31.131 --> 20:33.300
He used to run his leaf blower

20:33.333 --> 20:35.769
all the day long
while I was trying to sleep.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.172
So, I turned him into a vampire,
and now we're all good.

20:38.205 --> 20:40.774
-My Liege.
-Oh.

20:40.807 --> 20:45.179
How sweet. Arise, Jonathan.
We need your help.

20:45.212 --> 20:48.715
-Your wish is my command,
My Liege.
-Oh. Boop.

20:48.749 --> 20:54.054
Okay, so since
I already turned Jonathan,

20:54.087 --> 20:56.657
I guess, uh...
Yes, Derek, is it?

20:56.690 --> 20:58.091
-Uh, yes, sir.
-Right.

20:58.125 --> 21:01.161
Bite Jonathan and drink
some of his blood. Mm.

21:01.195 --> 21:05.365
-Okay, um... Hi. Uh, Derek.
-Mm. Mm.

21:05.399 --> 21:08.769
-Just gonna...
-Very good.

21:08.802 --> 21:12.306
Now Jonathan,
have a taste of Derek's blood.

21:12.339 --> 21:16.410
-Ah, okay.
-[sucking]

21:16.443 --> 21:19.012
Very nice.
Thank you, gentlemen.

21:19.046 --> 21:22.049
So... did it work?

21:22.082 --> 21:24.418
Ah, how are you feeling,
Jonathan?

21:24.451 --> 21:26.653
-Uh, I feel fine.
-Ah.

21:26.687 --> 21:28.322
I'm a little aggravated
because the motor

21:28.355 --> 21:30.157
in this here edge trimmer
keeps conking--

21:33.727 --> 21:38.298
So, at least now we know
one way that does not work.

21:38.332 --> 21:40.133
[Derek]
Huh.

21:45.072 --> 21:46.507
[Sean]
They really just gonna

21:46.540 --> 21:48.475
let us walk out of here?

21:48.509 --> 21:51.044
How'd you
pull that one off, Laz?

21:51.078 --> 21:53.213
Actually, Sean,
it was I who, um...

21:53.247 --> 21:57.117
At ease. It was I who convinced

21:57.150 --> 21:58.719
your good friend Laszlo

21:58.752 --> 22:01.321
to, uh, use his notorious charm.

22:01.355 --> 22:02.723
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.558
Between us, Nandor,

22:04.591 --> 22:07.294
what did you
say to them back there?

22:07.327 --> 22:09.630
I just said that
we had solved all the crimes

22:09.663 --> 22:11.698
that Sean and his pals
had committed.

22:11.732 --> 22:13.700
And, also, I got them

22:13.734 --> 22:15.169
to give their friend Terry

22:15.202 --> 22:17.037
-a little promotion.
-Oh, really? Great.

22:17.070 --> 22:19.606
And, just for funsies,
I told them

22:19.640 --> 22:22.309
that I was
Captain Sully Sullenberger,

22:22.342 --> 22:25.345
and you were the gentleman
with the moustache

22:25.379 --> 22:27.314
in that cop show that you like.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.049
Thomas Selleck in Blue Bloods?

22:29.082 --> 22:30.584
-That's it!
-Good move.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.319
-Look. There's Terry.
-[Nandor] Hi, Terry.

22:32.352 --> 22:35.088
-Terry! Captain Dumbfuck.
-[Laszlo] Well done, Nandor.

22:35.122 --> 22:37.558
[Sean]
Reporting for duty. [snorts]

22:37.591 --> 22:40.027
[Colin]
I think I'll just
have the tak...

22:40.060 --> 22:42.229
-Tak... tak...
-Tzat... tzatziki.

22:42.262 --> 22:43.697
-I'll get it. Tack...
-Tzat...

22:43.730 --> 22:48.035
Tacky. Tacky.
Uh, but without the, uh, yogurt.

22:55.776 --> 23:00.781
Halt!

23:00.814 --> 23:02.316
That was great.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.720
[clears throat]

23:06.753 --> 23:08.088
At ease.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.358
-At ease. At ease.
-Ah. There he is.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.427
At ease.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.229
-At ease. At ease.
-Hold on.

23:15.262 --> 23:16.497
No, no, no, I'm with them.
I'm with them.

23:16.530 --> 23:18.298
Gizmo, I need a word with you.

23:18.332 --> 23:20.200
-Okay.
-Coppers, fuck off.

23:20.234 --> 23:22.503
Yes, sir!
Thank you, Mr. Selleck!

23:22.536 --> 23:24.037
I think it's about time
you came clean.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.073
About what?

23:26.106 --> 23:28.208
Well, the others aren't
as observant as I am.

23:28.242 --> 23:30.077
But you've been off recently.

23:30.110 --> 23:31.478
And I've been watching you.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.314
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

23:34.348 --> 23:36.717
I think we got
a bit of a problem, Gizmo.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.052
The longer you keep it a secret,

23:39.086 --> 23:40.320
it's gonna remain a problem.

23:41.555 --> 23:43.423
I felt like I had
no other choice, okay?

23:45.092 --> 23:46.560
I mean, Nandor's been
promising to make me a vampire

23:46.593 --> 23:48.195
for 12 years, and it's
never come true, all right?

23:48.228 --> 23:50.564
So, like, Derek, he was
right there, he's a vampire,

23:50.597 --> 23:52.733
-so of course
I was gonna take-- Yeah.
-Whoa, whoa.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.735
I asked Derek to make me into
a vampire, but I regretted it

23:54.768 --> 23:56.370
-the second
it happened because--
-What the fuck?

23:56.403 --> 23:57.738
I thought you said
you figured it out.

23:57.771 --> 23:59.439
No!

23:59.473 --> 24:00.674
I just thought
you had the shits.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.477
I was gonna tell you to steer
clear of the breakfast burritos.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.646
Too much of the chilaquiles.

24:05.679 --> 24:08.115
You let someone,
who isn't your master,

24:08.148 --> 24:09.583
turn you into a vampire?

24:09.616 --> 24:10.717
You fucking idiot.

24:10.751 --> 24:12.386
I know, okay, I know.

24:12.419 --> 24:13.720
And it seems to be taking
forever to take full effect.

24:13.754 --> 24:15.088
And I don't know
what to do, okay?

24:15.122 --> 24:16.456
So please,
please don't tell Nandor.

24:16.490 --> 24:17.591
Tell Nandor?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.359
This is the greatest humiliation

24:19.393 --> 24:21.295
for any vampire.

24:21.328 --> 24:23.330
I don't know if he would
even survive it.

24:26.233 --> 24:28.368
All right, I've got an idea.

24:28.402 --> 24:30.304
But you've got to do exactly
what I tell you.

24:30.337 --> 24:32.039
Okay, yes, of course.

24:32.072 --> 24:34.041
Despite the fact that you've
already been bitten

24:34.074 --> 24:35.742
by a vampire, I could persuade

24:35.776 --> 24:38.111
Nandor to bite you again.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.280
No one'd be any the wiser.

24:43.116 --> 24:44.585
I don't think that's gonna work.

24:44.618 --> 24:46.486
You don't?

24:46.520 --> 24:48.455
Well, then you're fucked.
