-Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

Why are we talking about me?
You're the one going crazy.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.948

Because you are ashamed

COLLINS: How the hell did this happen?

34:36.574 --> 34:39.869
These two are not at all what they seem.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.165
You're dead, you hear me? You are dead!

34:45.625 --> 34:47.333
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:49.713 --> 34:51.005
Come on.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.846
(PANTING) They were... Oh, my God!

35:00.432 --> 35:01.849
-(PANTING) Oh, my God.
-Are you okay?

35:01.933 --> 35:02.933
Mmm-hmm.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.187
Oh, God, Phil! Come on!

35:07.230 --> 35:08.397
Okay. (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)

35:09.107 --> 35:11.192
We gotta do more cardio.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.778
I'm not out of shape, I'm scared!

35:13.862 --> 35:16.572
Oh, my God. Me, too. Me, too.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.282
-You done?
-Mmm-hmm.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.493
-Okay.
-(VOMITING)

35:20.911 --> 35:23.287
Okay. Let it out.

35:25.415 --> 35:26.957
Let it all out.

35:27.542 --> 35:31.086
-Oh, my God. Are you bleeding?
-(GAGGING) It's the cabernet.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.214
Okay. We gotta go.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.301
I'm sorry. Do you have any gum?

35:38.303 --> 35:39.303
CLAIRE: Gum?

35:39.930 --> 35:41.931
....precinct, Callahan speaking.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.183
ARROYO: I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to forgive me.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.101
I've already been on nine hours.

35:46.186 --> 35:49.563
So, one more time,
you were out at dinner where?

35:49.856 --> 35:50.898
At Claw.

35:50.982 --> 35:55.736
Claw. That place in TriBeCa with the $50
soup? How'd that work out for you?

35:56.071 --> 35:58.489
Not great. We couldn't get a table,

35:58.573 --> 36:00.699
so we ended up taking
somebody else's reservation.

36:02.035 --> 36:05.329
-You took someone's reservation?
-Yeah. Yeah. We took it...

36:05.413 --> 36:06.997
You just took a table?

36:07.082 --> 36:10.000
-(SCOFFS) Just like that?
-We know. Shocking.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.669
I was against it.

36:11.753 --> 36:16.006
Yeah. So, we're in the middle of dinner,
and these guys come up.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.925
Turns out these guys work for Joe Miletto.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.552
-Joe Miletto?
-That's what they said.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.136
But we didn't know that at the time.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.138
We thought they were
just guys from the restaurant.

36:23.223 --> 36:27.142
So we followed them into the alley,
and suddenly they just grab all of our stuff.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.686
That's why we don't have our IDs on us.

36:28.770 --> 36:29.854
(GASPING)

36:29.938 --> 36:31.605
Then... Yeah, it was scary. What?

36:31.690 --> 36:36.026
Then they start waving the guns around,
and they're talking about a flash drive.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.779
-Honey, why are you grabbing my knee?
-Because I just remembered

36:38.864 --> 36:42.324
that we are supposed to meet our friends,
who are a gay couple.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.660
The ones we met while night boating?

36:47.163 --> 36:49.498
Oh, my God!

36:49.583 --> 36:53.419
The bald and the crazy gay couple date...

36:53.503 --> 36:58.549
Shit my pants,
we forgot our gay couple dinner.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.426
-Oh, God!
-Can I say something here?

37:00.510 --> 37:01.552
Mmm-hmm.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.387
-Hello! Up here.
-PHIL: Yeah.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.724
-You two seem like a really nice couple.
-Thank you.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.268
Joe Miletto is not a nice man.

37:09.352 --> 37:13.731
Okay, take it from me.
He is genuinely a really mean, scary guy.

37:13.815 --> 37:16.901
Okay?
So if you're somehow blinking on his radar,

37:16.985 --> 37:18.986
we need to talk about
how we can help you.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.071
No, no, no. You don't understand.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.656
We took somebody's reservations.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.241
It was a terrible, terrible thing to do.

37:24.326 --> 37:25.618
So we need to leave
and ponder what we've done.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.494
-Honey, let's go.
-Stop!

37:27.746 --> 37:29.163
Sit down!

37:30.165 --> 37:33.751
Okay, you two can't be this weird.
What is going on?

37:37.005 --> 37:38.172
-Arroyo?
-Yeah.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.591
-Give me a second?
-Okay.

37:40.675 --> 37:44.386
Look, I'll be right back.
You two stay put, okay?

37:44.471 --> 37:46.013
Get your story together.

37:49.309 --> 37:51.018
Go, go, go, go!

38:00.070 --> 38:02.821
Oh, my God! Now the bad guys
are dressed up like cops.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.907
That's because the bad guys are cops.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.663
Why are there cops involved?
What is going on, Phil?

38:10.956 --> 38:14.458
-What are we going to do?
-Honey, honey,

38:14.542 --> 38:16.251
-it's okay. Just breathe.
-They are gonna kill us

38:16.336 --> 38:19.129
-and put our bodies in trash bags.
-No. It's gonna be all right. Just breathe.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.590
CLAIRE: They're gonna find us
where Giuliani put the homeless people.

38:21.675 --> 38:23.884
-Just breathe. Are you breathing?
-Only in.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.720
Honey, focus. Focus. Focus.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.555
Are you focusing?

38:29.516 --> 38:31.892
Okay. Okay.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.937
-Your eyes look crazy.
-I know, because I'm losing it.

38:35.021 --> 38:37.439
What are we gonna do? I'm losing it!
What are we gonna do?

38:37.524 --> 38:40.901
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

38:40.986 --> 38:43.153
We gotta get out of here.
We gotta go home.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.364
-We can't go home.
-What are you talking about, Phil?

38:45.448 --> 38:47.825
I am going home. I'm going home!

38:47.909 --> 38:50.744
Claire, they have our IDs.
They know where we live.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.579
They know where we live.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.749
-Oh, my God. The kids.
-Oh, my God.

Yes, I... I accept.

-Katy?
-Fosters, what up?

39:15.353 --> 39:17.021
Katy, are the kids okay?

39:17.105 --> 39:19.273
-Is everything okay?
-KATY: Yeah.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.609
Okay, listen to me. I'm gonna need you
to stay a little late tonight.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.529
-That is gonna be a problem for me.
-What?

39:25.613 --> 39:27.364
I actually have a party to get to.

39:27.449 --> 39:30.743
No. Why would you be going to a party?
You're babysitting.

39:30.827 --> 39:34.246
Yeah, I mean, you guys are the Fosters.
You're always home by 9:30.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.582
Yeah, well, tonight, it just so happens

39:36.666 --> 39:38.917
that we're gonna be staying out
a little bit later.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.378
Nice. But I already promised my friends.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.714
-Could you talk to her?
-Okay. Okay.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.799
-Katy? Hi, it's Phil.
-Hi.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.384
Where's that frigging guy
when you need him?

39:47.469 --> 39:49.970
Katy, I don't have time to talk right now.
I'll pay you double to stay.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.389
That's really nice of you,
but I don't think that's gonna close it.

39:52.474 --> 39:53.557
Are you kidding me?

39:53.641 --> 39:55.225
-What? What is she saying?
-She's saying...

39:55.310 --> 39:57.811
What is that little bitch saying?
Herjeans are too tight!

39:57.896 --> 40:01.482
You see, the thing is, my dad's been saying
I should jack your rate for a while now.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.734
So, I could miss the party,

40:03.818 --> 40:06.779
but, I think, rate-wise,
we're talking somewhere north of 30.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.238
I see them.

40:08.323 --> 40:10.574
-Pay it!
-Okay, fine. Fine. Katy, that's fine.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.618
Just get the kids out of the house
right now.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.453
Don't go out the front door.
Go out the back door.

40:14.537 --> 40:15.662
Take them over to your house.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.498
Okay, now I'm sensing
some kind of element of danger here.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.624
No. No.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.334
'Cause that's gonna run you
an extra five per.

40:20.460 --> 40:22.252
Fine! Fine! Just get the kids out right now!

40:22.337 --> 40:24.463
Tell them we love them
and everything is gonna be okay!

40:24.547 --> 40:26.048
Everything's okay! Tell them we love them.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.424
-Bye.
-Okay.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.176
Sucker. Kids!

40:29.469 --> 40:30.677
-Now what?
-They're safe. They're safe.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.472
We need to find someplace
with a lot of people. A lot of people.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.274
Hi, hi. Excuse me.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.443
Don't worry, we're not going to hurt you.

40:46.528 --> 40:49.279
Our names are Claire and Phil Foster.

40:49.364 --> 40:53.408
We are from New Jersey,
and through a series of strange events,

40:53.493 --> 40:55.536
we have been confused with someone else.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.789
And now, some unruly criminals,
who are also policemen...

40:58.873 --> 41:00.541
-Right.
-...are hunting us as prey.

41:00.625 --> 41:04.086
Again, we're not the bad guys, they are.
We're not going to hurt you.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.546
Honey, stop saying that,
'cause it makes it sound

41:05.630 --> 41:07.589
-like we are gonna hurt them.
-No, no. They get it.

41:07.674 --> 41:10.926
We need a place to hole up and hide,
and we don't have any money

41:11.010 --> 41:13.428
because these criminals, these dirty cops...

41:13.513 --> 41:15.848
Hey, hey.
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

41:15.932 --> 41:17.891
Okay, this is the oldest scam in the book.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.143
Beat it, junkies.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.769
-MAN: They make me sick.
-So dirty.

41:21.396 --> 41:22.563
Let's go.

41:22.856 --> 41:24.523
We are on our own.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.194
This whole night was a mistake.

41:29.279 --> 41:31.822
We never should've come in to this city.
This was a crazy idea.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.992
It wasn't a crazy idea.
It was just dinner in Manhattan.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.828
One night, one date where we're just not
talking about the kids the entire time

41:37.912 --> 41:40.414
-or what we have to do next week.
-And look where it got us.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.040
We should call 91 1 .

41:42.125 --> 41:44.042
Honey, this is Joe Miletto
we're talking about.

41:44.127 --> 41:46.461
-So?
-So? Those cops that tried to kill us?

41:46.546 --> 41:47.963
They're in his pocket.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.883
This guy owns cops!
We can't trust any cops.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.802
What are we gonna do? We can't go home,
we can't go to the police...

41:53.928 --> 41:58.515
Okay, okay, okay.
Miletto, he wants the Tripplehorns, why?

41:58.600 --> 42:00.100
Because they have the flash drive.

42:00.185 --> 42:03.437
All right,
what if they gave him the flash drive back?

42:03.521 --> 42:04.897
Why would they do that?

42:04.981 --> 42:07.524
Because we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna make them do it.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.943
Once Miletto has the flash drive,
this thing ends.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.695
Okay. I like that. I am completely with you.

42:11.779 --> 42:14.948
I just have to ask you one question,
and do not judge me.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.950
What is a flash drive?

42:17.118 --> 42:19.244
-Seriously?
-Phil, I can't...

42:19.329 --> 42:22.831
Okay, it's a little storage disk
that you stick in the side of a laptop.

42:22.916 --> 42:25.042
Oh, it's a computer sticky thing? That's...

42:25.126 --> 42:27.377
In my office we call it
a computer sticky thing.

42:27.462 --> 42:30.422
Okay. Okay. We need to get
the computer sticky thing to save our lives.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.634
How? We don't know anything
about the Tripplehorns.

42:33.927 --> 42:35.427
That's not entirely true.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.471
We know where
they were going to have dinner tonight.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.474
-Okay.
-Come on. Come on.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.690
Hi, we were... Hello? Up here.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.902
We were in here earlier,
having dinner with our friend Sam-I-Am.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.238
-You mean Will.i.am?
-Okay.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.114
Is that what you call him?
That's weird. I don't like that.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.824
-Yeah, it is weird.
-No, listen, anyway,

42:57.909 --> 43:00.744
we were here, and Will.i.am thinks
he left his phone at the table,

43:00.828 --> 43:02.162
so we need to check at the table.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.373
I'd like to check the table for the phone,
if you don't mind.

43:04.457 --> 43:06.833
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Look at me. Can you... Oh, God.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.919
-We need to check the table for the phone.
-What's your problem?

43:09.003 --> 43:10.921
-Hello? Hello? Anything?
-Oh, my God.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.089
-Here we go.
-How are you not getting this?

43:12.173 --> 43:14.424
-He needs to check the table for the phone.
-Fine. This way.

43:14.509 --> 43:16.593
-Wow. I just wasted half my life.

He said he left it on the table.

43:30.358 --> 43:35.195
Well, that was just a big, fat waste of time.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.240
The King of Siam is going to be livid.

43:38.616 --> 43:42.202
Thank you for all of your help,
and I am being sarcastic.

-(PHONE RINGING)
-Claw, you're welcome.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.631
Okay, we got a phone number.

43:54.716 --> 43:57.426
How do we use it to find their address?

43:57.885 --> 44:00.387
I think I know someone who can help.

44:01.514 --> 44:03.015
Wait, how do you know this guy, again?

44:03.099 --> 44:05.976
I showed him a bunch of houses upstate.
I mean, it was a few years ago,

44:06.060 --> 44:08.895
but I remember
he was some kind of security expert.

44:09.397 --> 44:11.148
Anyway, he ended up
buying a place down here

44:11.232 --> 44:12.899
from an agent in this office.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.110
I forgot the address,
but maybe we can find it in the files.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.821
-Do you have a key?
-No, I don't. Can I have your coat?

44:18.114 --> 44:19.531
-Yeah. You cold?
-Yeah.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.825
Listen, I think I can pick the lock.

44:21.909 --> 44:24.703

56:00.607 --> 56:03.693

breaches the jelly perimeter,

56:04.945 --> 56:06.946
but if you just let me do something for you,

56:07.031 --> 56:10.241
I think that I would surprise you. I really do.

56:12.161 --> 56:13.786
I know I'd surprise you.

56:14.788 --> 56:19.459
You think I don't hear myself?
You think I like sounding like a total bitch?

56:19.543 --> 56:20.710

56:26.467 --> 56:28.801
-Brad and Haley are splitting up.
-I know.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.222
Do you ever think about leaving me?

56:34.099 --> 56:35.308
No.

56:38.645 --> 56:41.939
Really? You never fantasize about
leaving me for another man?

56:42.024 --> 56:43.649
No, never. No.

56:44.485 --> 56:49.197
Never. No, God, if anything,
I fantasize sometimes about being alone.

56:50.491 --> 56:52.867
-What does that mean?
-(SIGHS) I don't know.

56:52.951 --> 56:56.329
Just, there are times
when I've just thought about,

56:56.413 --> 56:58.414
on my worst day, just, you know,

56:58.499 --> 57:00.249
leaving our house
and just going someplace.

57:00.334 --> 57:05.880
Like checking into a hotel
and just being in a quiet room by myself.

57:05.964 --> 57:08.925
Just sitting in a quiet air-conditioned room,

57:09.009 --> 57:13.221
sitting down, eating my lunch
with no one touching me,

57:13.555 --> 57:16.641
drinking a Diet Sprite, by myself.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.227
That sounds awful.

57:19.311 --> 57:21.062
Look, I just wanna have one day

57:21.146 --> 57:24.440
that doesn't depend on
how everybody else's day goes.

57:24.525 --> 57:27.110
It's not like I have
some gross sex fantasy or something.

57:27.194 --> 57:30.071
That I would understand.
That makes sense to me.

57:30.155 --> 57:31.864
I mean, everybody has gross sex fantasies.

57:31.949 --> 57:34.909
I mean, obviously yours is with Holbrooke.

57:34.993 --> 57:38.746
-With his 1 8-story shoulder muscles.
-He doesn't...

57:38.997 --> 57:40.540
Mine is with

57:41.208 --> 57:42.708
Cyndi Lauper.

57:44.044 --> 57:45.378

57:46.588 --> 57:50.091
-Wait, are you serious about Cyndi Lauper?
-Yeah, she's hot.

57:50.175 --> 57:53.261
-Really? Like, present-day or...
-Present day.

57:54.054 --> 57:56.472
Well, it's an interesting choice.

57:59.226 --> 58:03.729
Brad said to me
that he and Haley were fine,

58:04.940 --> 58:08.067
and that they were
just really excellent roommates.

58:10.737 --> 58:12.363
That's not what we are, is it?

58:12.781 --> 58:14.031
No.

58:17.202 --> 58:18.411
Right?

58:22.791 --> 58:27.086
No.

We should get going.

"Hello, people are trying to kill us

The cops that were at Holbrooke's

I used the cell phone.

that is the filthiest thing I've ever heard.

Thing is, this ledger

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:46.750

and information about one client,

but they were blackmailing the DA.

01:15:55.843 --> 01:15:58.220

is at the bottom of the East River,

if those cops catch up with us.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.147

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:26.414
No, we might get bumped off.
We might get whacked.

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:29.834
Okay. Let me... Okay,
let me break it down for you, all righty?

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:33.213
That guy over there.
Let's just say that guy is Crenshaw.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.423
He's a DA. He's a good guy.

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:39.052
He should be busting
people like Joe Miletto.

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:42.347
He's a gangster. He's a bad guy.
He's very bad.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.849
But Crenshaw can't bust Miletto,

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:49.271
because Crenshaw goes to Miletto's clubs
to get hookers.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:53.733
Oh, boy, I hope she's really a hooker.
That would be amazing.

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:57.445
Now, Miletto makes
a flash drive implicating Crenshaw.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.489
Which Taste and Whippit steal

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.366
from The Peppermint Hippo,
where she works.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:05.120
Right, they steal it
so they can blackmail the DA.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.081
So, those two cops don't work for Miletto.
They work for Crenshaw.

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:09.165
Right.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:12.294
And that's why Taste was acting so weird
when you mentioned Miletto's name.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:15.130
-Right.
-Oh, my God, Phil, I totally got this.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.799
-It has something to do with Crenshaw?
-It has...

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:19.968
Yes, honey, it has
everything to do with Crenshaw.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.553
That's the key.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.722
We have to find a way to get to Crenshaw.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:27.934
Well, the Tripplehorns got to him
at The Peppermint Hippo.

01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:30.812
And we're the Tripplehorns.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.564
Hells yes, we are.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.653
We're gonna need some help.

01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:40.405
Oh, "whacked off"! Oh! Oh, God.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.240
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.163
Hi.

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:50.373
Is that my tracksuit?

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.418
Yes, it was in the trunk of your Audi,

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.712
which is now parked
over by the East River,

01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:59.341
and is probably
in need of significant repair,

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.676
for which I'm sure
I'll be able to pay you back

01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:04.429
over the next several decades.
Also, on my tab,

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:08.767
I would like to add that super old gun
that I stole from your hallway,

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:11.644
which, incidentally, was not very useful.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:13.438
It just went... (EXHALES)

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:15.357
PHIL: But that's not the reason we're here.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:18.651
As impossible as this may be
to believe, Holbrooke,

01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:23.365
our night has actually gotten weirder
since we saw you last.

01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:26.409
There were cars, then we...
They got hooked, and...

01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:27.869
One of them was your car. Anyway...

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.704
I've had an interesting night myself.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:32.791
And I'm really tired, so as nice as it was
to see you again, Claire,

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.834
how about you two
go knock on somebody else's door, okay?

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.462
-No...
-No, no, no. No. Here's the thing.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.716
I just wanted
to take my wife to dinner tonight.

01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:45.053
I was just hoping
that we would have one night

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:49.641
where we could, you know, feel like new.

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:53.478
And now, all I want to do is get us home.

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:57.190
And I've got a plan.
I've got a way to do that.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.568
I'm not very good with plans generally,
but I've got one.

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.779
And I need help.

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:05.490
And even though your pecs
make me wanna kill myself,

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:09.411
and your girlfriend is so hot it's like
looking through a shimmering jet engine,

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:14.165
I know, and I believe,
that there is a real person

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.961
that understands exactly
what I'm going through right now.

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:22.173
So, please, Holbrooke,
will you let us come in?

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:27.095
Will you let us explain to you
what we want?

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:32.559
And will you, for the love of God,

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:34.936
put on a fucking shirt?

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.987
-Come on in.
-(SOFTLY) Thank you.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.841
-PHIL: Here it is. Remember the plan?
-Barely.

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:18.146
Let us in. This is a new girl.
She's working tonight.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.899
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm the new girl.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.109
-Really?
-(FIRMLY) Yeah.

01:20:23.194 --> 01:20:25.987
-And who are you?
-I am her pimp daddy.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.822
(SCOFFS) You're her pimp?

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.116
That right.

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:33.286
-Really?
-Yeah, dummy, he's my pimp.

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:34.871
So can I go inside and start my shift,

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:39.250
or do I have to call Joey Miletto
and tell him that his bellboy made me late?

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.675
(WHISPERING) I don't really have gum.

01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:51.679
-The locker rooms are on the left.
-Come on, pimp.

01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:57.977
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.653
-(WHISPERING) Wait right here.
-Where are you going?

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.376
Hey, do you have anything in a size eight?

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.087
What? Gross. No.

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:29.509
(SIGHS)

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.930
Oh, no. That's for a monkey.

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.228
Okay.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.611
Hey, I'm a man on the bottom.
You into that?

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:50.738
I'm sorry. I... Oh, my God!

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.907
I know. I know. Shut up. It's...

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:54.492
You look awesome!

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:58.204
Why is it so bright out here?
It's supposed to be dark and seedy.

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:01.457
Give a 40-year-old stripper/mom a break.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:04.210
Look at your boobs!

01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:06.796
I had to put it on backwards and spin it.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.256
I think I lost a nipple.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.675
No, you look great!

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.261
-For reals?
-Yeah, for reals.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:16.347
It's the only one long enough
to cover my C-section scar.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.601
-I cannot stop looking at your boobs.
-Come on.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.269
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:22.854
I want you to buy that.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.478
-Honey, I don't think I can do this.
-Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:07.148
Honey, listen to me.
You are a beautiful, strong woman.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:09.067
You are the mother of my children.

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:11.319
Now, I want you to go in there

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:14.447
and pop that coochie.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.157
-Pop the coochie.
-Just pop it out.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.784
-So we can go home.
-Let's go pop it.

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.786
-Come on.
-For the kids.

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:23.790
Uh-uh.

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:25.792
I'm here for Crenshaw.

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:28.836
Look up, please.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.095
Okay, head on in.

01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:39.013
-I'll be waiting right here.
-Okay.

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:40.723
No. The both of you.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.893
He likes you, too.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.605
Well, well, well.
Somebody caught the pervert's eye.

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:49.857
-No, no, no, no. I can't do this.
-Yeah, you can,

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:52.360
because you are
a beautiful and amazing man,

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:53.903
and the father of my children,

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:56.614
and you are gonna get in there
and work that pole like a runaway.

There he is, over there in the sunglasses.

01:24:12.715 --> 01:24:14.966
(GASPS) He has his broom with him.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.927
Oh, that's gross. Why does he need that?

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.012
Probably a lot of messes he makes in here.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:23.266
Needs a mop to clean up
all the splooge in this place.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:26.436

-I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

-Can I help you?
-Yeah, we're here to see Crenshaw.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.651
No one gets close to Crenshaw
unless he picks you.

-Picks us, yes. Picks us for what?
-CRENSHAW: Carlton, move aside.

Very Wild West saloon chick.

I like that. I like that.

And you brought your androgynous friend.

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:57.592
Oh! Oh! Oh! Is it a man or a woman?

01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.552
(LAUGHING) I don't know! I don't know!

01:25:00.471 --> 01:25:02.180
It's very sexy.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:04.640
I am going to keep you guessing.

to have sex in front of him.

spend time with me, you have to earn it.

-while remaining relatively still.
-Yeah. Just wanna, like, talk to you.

01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:37.215
I don't come here to talk.
You either leave or you start dancing.

Why don't we take a walk
and talk about things privately?

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:54.578
This could have been so good.

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:06.465
This is part of the plan, right?

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:08.134

You give me the flash drive,

both your wife's arms.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.897
I put the flash drive someplace
no one is ever going to find it.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:23.566
But if our associate, Mr. Holbrooke Grant,

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:26.944
doesn't hear from us
every hour on the hour until we're safe,

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:30.281
then he will release
the contents of that drive.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:34.452
He's the ex-military guy
we questioned tonight.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:36.620

Excuse me, sir,
we're trying to do a rooftop thing.

-Could you just give us a minute?
-Frank?

01:29:43.754 --> 01:29:47.423
No! I can't give you a minute.
This is my rooftop, toots!

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:49.258
Okay.

01:29:49.342 --> 01:29:50.926
It's okay, Claire. We were expecting him.

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:55.056
-What? Oh, my God! I am so lost.
-They were just about to leave, Joe.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.183
You know, they got a guy on the outside
that has the flash drive.

01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:58.976
Yeah, the flash drive. There's no play here.

01:29:59.061 --> 01:30:00.269

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:04.231
Oh, don't worry, though.
We won't say a word about the pictures.

-Nothing.

-He doesn't know?
-Know what?

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:14.366
Oh, wow!
I kind of pulled a boner here. Sorry.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:17.787
But I get it. I totally know why you'd have
pornographic pictures of the DA.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:19.955

for a rainy day.

they're gonna come in handy!

-You zip your vagina.

No. No, it's okay! When he says "vagina,"
he means your face.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.967
You said that what was on that drive

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:34.178
were the city contracts
that I flowed your way.

I've been keeping the cops off your ass,

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.269

-Really dirty, gross pictures.

you guys have some things to resolve,
