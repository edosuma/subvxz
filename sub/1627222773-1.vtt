00:12.972 --> 00:15.182
NARRATOR:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15.266 --> 00:18.769
we now ask for
your complete attention.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.772
If you want to sing,
laugh, clap,

00:21.856 --> 00:24.859
cry, yawn, boo or fart,

00:24.942 --> 00:27.737
please, do it in your head,

00:27.820 --> 00:29.196
only in your head.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.951
You are now kindly requested
to keep silent

00:34.034 --> 00:38.289
and to hold your breath until
the very end of the show.

00:38.372 --> 00:42.626
Breathing will not be tolerated
during the show.

00:42.710 --> 00:46.922
So, please take a deep,
last breath right now.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.509
Thank you.

00:56.223 --> 01:02.396
Underneath the moonlight

01:02.480 --> 01:07.485
My good friend Pierrot

02:00.204 --> 02:03.415
-

02:03.499 --> 02:05.543
WOMAN:
Ah, ah.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.966
Nastya, it’s going to start.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.557
So...

02:19.640 --> 02:21.475
may we start?

02:21.559 --> 02:23.978
RUSSELL:
So may we start?

02:24.061 --> 02:26.063
RON:
High time to start

02:30.818 --> 02:33.028
One, two, three, four!

02:48.878 --> 02:50.713
So may we start?

02:53.007 --> 02:55.009
-So may we start?
-So may we start?

02:57.219 --> 02:59.054
It’s time to start

03:01.348 --> 03:03.100
-High time to start
-High time to start

03:05.978 --> 03:08.564
They hope that it goes the way

03:08.647 --> 03:10.357
-It’s supposed to go
-It’s supposed to go

03:10.441 --> 03:14.236
There’s fear in them all
but they can’t let it show

03:14.320 --> 03:18.490
They’re underprepared
but that may be enough

03:18.574 --> 03:22.161
The budget is large
but still it’s not enough

03:22.244 --> 03:23.495
So may we start?

03:23.579 --> 03:26.206
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

03:26.290 --> 03:27.791
So may we start?

03:27.875 --> 03:30.502
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

03:30.586 --> 03:31.837
It’s time to start

03:31.921 --> 03:34.590
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

03:34.673 --> 03:35.966
High time to start

03:36.050 --> 03:39.219
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

03:39.303 --> 03:41.805
We’ve fashioned a world,
a world

03:41.889 --> 03:43.390
Built just for you

03:43.474 --> 03:45.935
A tail of songs and fury

03:46.018 --> 03:47.478
-With no taboo
-With no taboo

03:47.561 --> 03:49.647
We’ll sing and die for you

03:49.730 --> 03:51.398
-Yes, in minor keys
-Yes, in minor keys

03:51.482 --> 03:54.109
And if you want us
to kill, too

03:54.193 --> 03:55.444
-We may agree
-We may agree

03:55.527 --> 03:56.737
So may we start?

03:56.820 --> 03:59.531
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

03:59.615 --> 04:00.908
So may we start?

04:00.991 --> 04:03.577
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

04:03.661 --> 04:04.870
It’s time to start

04:04.954 --> 04:07.790
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

04:07.873 --> 04:09.124
High time to start

04:09.208 --> 04:12.461
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

04:12.544 --> 04:16.674
So close all the doors
and let’s begin the show

04:16.757 --> 04:19.009
The exits are clearly marked

04:19.093 --> 04:20.719
Thought you should know

04:20.803 --> 04:24.723
The authors are here
so let’s not show disdain

04:24.807 --> 04:26.141
The authors are here

04:26.225 --> 04:29.645
And they’re a little vain

04:29.728 --> 04:33.983
A little vain

04:34.900 --> 04:36.443
Now...

04:36.527 --> 04:41.240
The music resounds
and all the flames are lit

04:41.323 --> 04:45.995
So, ladies and gents,
please shut up and sit

04:46.078 --> 04:49.081
The curtain of our eyelids

04:49.164 --> 04:51.250
Lazily rise

04:51.333 --> 04:54.795
But where’s the stage,
you wonder

04:54.878 --> 04:56.547
Is it

04:56.630 --> 04:57.923
Outside

04:58.007 --> 04:59.925
Or is it within?

05:00.009 --> 05:02.678
-Outside? Within?
-Outside? Within?

05:02.761 --> 05:06.306
Outside? Within?

05:06.390 --> 05:08.475
So may we start?

05:08.559 --> 05:11.270
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

05:11.353 --> 05:12.646
So may we start?

05:12.730 --> 05:15.399
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

05:15.482 --> 05:16.734
It’s time to start

05:16.817 --> 05:19.486
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

05:19.570 --> 05:20.988
High time to start

05:21.071 --> 05:23.449
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

05:23.532 --> 05:25.159
-So may we start?
-

05:25.242 --> 05:27.786
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

05:27.870 --> 05:29.288
So may we start?

05:29.371 --> 05:31.999
May we start, may we,
may we now start?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.584
-It’s time to start
-May we start

05:33.667 --> 05:36.045
-May we, may we now start?
-

05:36.128 --> 05:37.880
-High time to start
-May we start

05:37.963 --> 05:40.257
-May we, may we now start?
-

05:40.340 --> 05:41.800
OFFICER
Don’t try to start.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.552
-May we now start
-OFFICER: Don’t try to start.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.971
-May we now start
-May we now start

05:46.055 --> 05:47.723
-May we now start

05:47.806 --> 05:49.516
-Bye, Henry.
-Bye, Henry.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.518
-May we now start

05:51.602 --> 05:52.770
Bye, Henry.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.146
Good luck!

05:56.732 --> 05:58.233
BOY:
Bye-bye. Bye.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.319
-RUSSELL: Bye, Ann.
-RON: Bye, Ann.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.905
Bon voyage.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.407
-RUSSELL: Bon voyage.
-WOMAN: Bye.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.201
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.871
Bye-bye.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.730
RUSSELL and CHORUS BOYS:
True love always finds

06:36.814 --> 06:39.817
Always finds

06:39.900 --> 06:43.403
-A way
-A way

06:43.487 --> 06:49.451
-Afraid
-But true love often goes

06:49.535 --> 06:51.537
-Afraid
-Astray

06:51.620 --> 06:54.331
Astray

07:03.215 --> 07:06.009
True love always finds

07:06.093 --> 07:08.387
Always finds

07:08.470 --> 07:12.141
-A way
-A way

07:13.350 --> 07:16.103
But true love often goes

07:16.186 --> 07:19.398
Often goes

07:19.481 --> 07:23.068
Astray, astray

08:08.739 --> 08:12.075
MAN:
Come on! Come on, Henry!

08:12.159 --> 08:15.245
AUDIENCE
Henry! Henry! Henry!

08:15.329 --> 08:17.956
-WOMAN: Henry, I love you!
-Henry! Henry!

08:23.545 --> 08:25.672
Yes, laugh, laugh, laugh.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.602
One, two, three, four, five,

08:38.685 --> 08:40.145
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.522
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.941
One, two, three, four, five,

08:44.024 --> 08:45.525
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

08:45.609 --> 08:49.780
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.366
-Ladies and gentlemen,
-

08:52.449 --> 08:54.326
are you ready?

08:54.409 --> 08:56.036
-AUDIENCE: Yeah!
-No.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.622
No one is ever ready for

08:58.705 --> 09:01.792
a mildly offensive evening
with...

09:01.875 --> 09:04.044
The Ape of God.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.258
Here for his triumphant
new show,

09:09.341 --> 09:14.096
the world infamous
Henry McHenry!

09:35.617 --> 09:37.619
-

09:40.706 --> 09:43.041
WOMAN:
Love you, Henry!

09:57.055 --> 09:59.016
-

09:59.099 --> 10:01.393
-

10:05.147 --> 10:06.898
Oh, this smoke shit.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.328
What is this fucking smoke
supposed to mean anyway?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.708
I think I’m getting
allergic to it.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.210
Wish they’d use
laughing gas instead.

10:28.754 --> 10:31.089
Would make my life easier.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.550
Or even better,

10:33.633 --> 10:34.885
cyanide gas.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.349
So... I’m here to make
you laugh tonight.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.937
Yes, laugh, laugh, laugh.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.982
I’m not sure
I can do it tonight.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.986
Not sure I should even try.

10:54.946 --> 10:58.283
Making people laugh
is a disgusting...

11:00.535 --> 11:03.038
...deceitful trick anyway.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.456
Yes. Why should I activate

11:04.539 --> 11:06.917
Your ventromedial
prefrontal cortex

11:07.000 --> 11:09.211
So your 15 facial muscles
will contract

11:09.294 --> 11:11.505
So your fucking
zygomatic muscle will react

11:11.588 --> 11:13.924
While your epiglottis
half-closes your larynx

11:14.007 --> 11:15.342
Clap

11:18.970 --> 11:20.972
Yes, why the fuck should I?

11:22.516 --> 11:23.975
Why should I make you...

11:24.059 --> 11:26.395
HENRY and CHORUS GIRLS:
Laugh, laugh, laugh

11:26.478 --> 11:29.147
But don’t make me,
don’t make me, don’t make me

11:29.231 --> 11:30.941
Can’t stand to hear you

11:31.024 --> 11:33.443
Laugh, laugh, laugh

11:33.527 --> 11:36.154
’Cause you bore me,
you bore me, you bore me

11:36.238 --> 11:37.823
I’ll still make you

11:37.906 --> 11:40.283
Gasp, gasp, gasp

11:40.367 --> 11:42.994
But don’t worry, don’t worry,
don’t worry

11:43.078 --> 11:45.080
You probably will not

11:45.163 --> 11:47.416
Choke, choke, choke

11:47.499 --> 11:49.918
Kick the bucket, kick
the bucket, kick the bucket

11:50.001 --> 11:52.295
-Kick the bucket
-

12:05.809 --> 12:07.436
Huh.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.356
Well, of course,

12:11.440 --> 12:14.067
I’ve heard the rumors, too.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.902
They say my show kills.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.865
But relax, see my contract?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.366
Save your breath.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.077
Says so here:

12:24.161 --> 12:26.037
"Mr. Henry McHenry
is not allowed

12:26.121 --> 12:27.706
to make the public
laugh to death."

12:27.789 --> 12:30.041
-

12:35.297 --> 12:38.133
Can’t make your alveoli
pop tonight.

12:38.216 --> 12:42.387
No dislocated jaws,
no belly explosions.

12:42.471 --> 12:45.765
-However, asthmatics,
-

12:45.849 --> 12:48.351
keep your inhalers in position!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.270
-Okay?
-AUDIENCE: Okay!

12:50.353 --> 12:52.230
-Ready?
-AUDIENCE: Ready!

12:52.314 --> 12:53.523
Laugh.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.943
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha, ha-ha

12:57.027 --> 13:00.864
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha

13:00.947 --> 13:04.534
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha, ha-ha

13:04.618 --> 13:07.329
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha

13:07.412 --> 13:08.455
Okay, shut up.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.609
-Yes.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.860
Why did I become a comedian?

13:38.944 --> 13:40.320
Why did I
become a comedian?

13:40.403 --> 13:42.614
To entertain some balding men?

13:42.697 --> 13:45.325
To bring a touch of levity
to tragic times?

13:45.408 --> 13:47.244
-Not me.
-

13:47.327 --> 13:49.663
To bring some joy
to those who have none?

13:49.746 --> 13:52.707
To cast a skeptical eye
toward common knowledge?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.709
-Uh-uh. -Why did I
become a comedian?

13:54.793 --> 13:56.670
To make you notice what you’ve
always surely noticed,

13:56.753 --> 13:58.630
never noticing you noticed
until I ask you:

13:58.713 --> 14:01.091
-"Have you ever noticed?"
-Why did I become a comedian?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.343
-Sure, but not only that.
-Why did I become a comedian?

14:03.426 --> 14:05.136
To convey with a smile

14:05.220 --> 14:08.932
these deep-seated feelings
of hatred and humiliation

14:09.015 --> 14:11.101
we all seem to be sharing?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.352
-When...
-

14:12.435 --> 14:15.063
All the Catholics
hate the Muslims

14:15.146 --> 14:17.524
And the Muslims
hate the Catholics

14:17.607 --> 14:19.776
And the Tutsis hate the Hutus

14:19.859 --> 14:22.070
And... everybody
hates the Jews

14:28.159 --> 14:30.870
-MAN: So, why, Henry?
-WOMAN: Yes, why, Henry?

14:30.954 --> 14:32.247
Why?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.457
AUDIENCE: Yes, why did you
become a comedian?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.793
-For the money?
-For the money?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.461
Oh, no, no.

14:38.545 --> 14:42.799
No, I’ve come from poverty
and severity

14:42.882 --> 14:45.594
and now have reached big money
and obscenity.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.429
So why did you become
a comedian?

14:47.512 --> 14:49.639
-For the fame?
-For the fame?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.891
-Oh, no, no.
-

14:51.975 --> 14:54.894
Though fame is like a flame,

14:54.978 --> 14:57.022
glorious,

14:57.105 --> 14:58.398
superfluous.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.108
So nice being famous
for being infamous.

15:00.191 --> 15:03.278
Okay, but why did you become
a comedian?

15:03.361 --> 15:04.904
-Fear of death?
-Fear of death?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.156
Oh, no, no.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.617
’Cause you see, I have sympathy
for the abyss.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.660
What did he say?
What is "abyss"?

15:10.744 --> 15:13.580
A-B-Y-S-S!

15:13.663 --> 15:14.998
You illiterates.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.795
That’s why I must never...

15:20.879 --> 15:23.715
never cast my eyes
towards the abyss.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.808
Lady, that’s quite an abyss
you’ve got.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.810
-

15:35.894 --> 15:38.647
So why, why did you become
a comedian?

15:38.730 --> 15:40.023
For the women?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.400
Oh, no, well...

15:42.484 --> 15:43.526
Okay, let me explain.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.167
You see...

15:59.250 --> 16:02.379
my serial pussy days are over.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.548
Because, well...

16:05.632 --> 16:08.051
I’ve, I’ve just met someone.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.180
Someone so...

16:13.848 --> 16:16.518
It all went so fast.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.396
I just moved into her tiny
hidden palace,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.815
’cause, yes, she’s a queen.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.025
And now,

16:24.109 --> 16:25.860
I’m engaged.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.449
I know, I know.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.952
Marrying a girl when you’re
as young and green as me,

16:34.035 --> 16:36.746
it’s like...
swimming the Atlantic

16:36.830 --> 16:39.541
with a concrete block
tied to your left testicle.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.671
Well, yes, now, I’m engaged.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.091
Copped out in my early age.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.927
So who, you ask, would marry me?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.179
Who would be the least likely?

16:54.472 --> 16:57.475
No, this ain’t a joke so far:

16:57.559 --> 16:59.728
-Yes, Ann Defrasnoux,
-WOMAN: Oh, no!

16:59.811 --> 17:01.730
-the opera star.
-

17:01.813 --> 17:03.523
What?

17:03.606 --> 17:04.774
What’s wrong, lady?

17:04.858 --> 17:07.318
Ann and me, you disagree?

17:07.402 --> 17:09.487
What is it, blasphemy?

17:09.571 --> 17:11.823
Why, is she too...

17:11.906 --> 17:12.949
perfect?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.409
AUDIENCE:
Yes, yes, yes

17:14.492 --> 17:18.121
And I, some loathsome insect?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.748
Yes, yes, yes

17:19.831 --> 17:21.124
Okay, I’ll accept that.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.010
HENRY
First time I fell in love...

17:33.970 --> 17:35.972
...woke up next to the girl...

17:37.432 --> 17:38.850
...rushed out to buy myself

17:38.933 --> 17:42.645
the biggest motorbike
I could find

17:42.729 --> 17:45.106
and escaped

17:45.190 --> 17:46.983
fast and far.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.197
HENRY: But Ann the soprano
has changed me.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.075
I have changed.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.121
How?

18:00.205 --> 18:02.624
I’m still not sure.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.959
Time will tell.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.003
What I see in her

18:07.086 --> 18:08.505
is obvious.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.133
What she sees in me,

18:12.217 --> 18:14.469
hmm...

18:14.552 --> 18:16.221
it’s a little more puzzling.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.892
HENRY: Wish that she could
be here now

18:20.975 --> 18:22.811
But she’s at
the opera tonight

18:22.894 --> 18:26.356
Opera, where everything
is sacred

18:26.439 --> 18:27.565
Amen!

18:27.649 --> 18:29.192
First she dies
and dies and dies

18:29.275 --> 18:31.486
And then she bows
and bows and bows

18:31.569 --> 18:33.530
She’ll be bowing now till dawn

18:33.613 --> 18:35.448
Ann, dear, I love you so

18:35.532 --> 18:37.617
But all that bowing’s got to go

18:37.700 --> 18:39.702
Take a last bow, enough

18:39.786 --> 18:41.913
Make it seem more off the cuff

18:43.414 --> 18:45.750
WOMAN:
But, Henry, you didn’t answer:

18:45.834 --> 18:47.585
why?

18:47.669 --> 18:49.671
AUDIENCE: Yes, why did you
become a comedian?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.756
So, why did you become
a comedian?

18:51.840 --> 18:54.968
Yes, why did you
become a comedian?

18:55.051 --> 18:56.761
Hey, Henry?!

18:56.845 --> 18:58.346
Why?

18:58.429 --> 18:59.848
I’ll tell you why.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.770
To disarm people.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.692
Make them laugh.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.321
It’s the only way I know
to tell the truth

19:15.405 --> 19:17.156
without getting killed.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.620
Anyway, every fuckin’...

19:22.704 --> 19:26.165
-

19:26.249 --> 19:29.460
-

19:31.546 --> 19:33.214
-

19:35.174 --> 19:37.468
-MAN: Oh, shit.
-

19:38.428 --> 19:40.680
WOMAN:
Henry, you bastard!

19:40.763 --> 19:42.348
-

19:42.432 --> 19:44.684
HENRY:
Ooh.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.769
MAN:
Fuck you, Henry!

19:50.106 --> 19:51.441
See, I, too, can die.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.944
And then...

19:55.028 --> 19:56.404
bow.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.743
Okay, well,
that’s it for tonight.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.411
AUDIENCE:
Oh, no, no, no!

20:03.494 --> 20:06.247
Oh, yes, yes, ’cause I’m sick
and tired of making you...

20:06.331 --> 20:09.000
Laugh, laugh, laugh

20:09.083 --> 20:12.003
But don’t leave me, don’t
leave me, don’t leave me

20:12.086 --> 20:13.671

20:13.755 --> 20:15.924
Laugh, laugh, laugh

20:16.007 --> 20:18.927

20:36.235 --> 20:37.904

20:46.913 --> 20:50.917

choke, choke, choke

20:51.000 --> 20:53.628
Or kick the bucket, kick the

Let’s hear it, let’s hear it!

21:35.253 --> 21:37.255

-Thank you!

22:30.808 --> 22:32.477
How did the show go?

I killed them...

22:36.189 --> 22:38.608
destroyed them...

22:38.691 --> 22:40.276

Well, you die so magnificently.

We love each other so much

Ann’s the one with the genius,
the grace.

I’m the one with
the technical expertise.

I’m a conductor,

38:11.164 --> 38:13.834
around the Defrasnoux-McHenry
household

38:13.917 --> 38:16.336

NEWSMAN Crews faced
a major battle yesterday

44:35.256 --> 44:37.217
in Simi Valley,
northwest of Los Angeles,

44:37.300 --> 44:38.885
where flames came
dangerously close

44:38.968 --> 44:41.388
to the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library

44:41.471 --> 44:42.722
and to nearby neighborhoods...

44:42.806 --> 44:45.892
ANN: Oscar,
I feel like sleeping now.

44:45.975 --> 44:47.936
Please wake me up
before we get there.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.104
OSCAR:
Sure.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.189
NEWSMAN:
Judy, what do you see there?

44:51.272 --> 44:53.108
NEWSWOMAN:
Well, good morning.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.609
This fire is raging right now.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.694
You can see the vortex
of flames,

44:56.778 --> 45:00.115
smoke and wind blowing
in our direction.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.991
Imagine what it’s like
for firefighters

45:02.075 --> 45:04.786
to approach flames like that.

45:04.869 --> 45:06.329
NEWSMAN:
Despite an all-out assault,

45:06.413 --> 45:08.289
the flames still managed
to jump the freeway,

45:08.373 --> 45:10.500
forcing nearby neighborhoods
to be evacuated.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.710
The fire quickly consumed
this barn,

45:12.794 --> 45:15.088
where volunteers helped
rescue animals...

45:30.019 --> 45:32.856
CHORUS:

-Yes, why?

46:27.911 --> 46:29.996
Why only now?

46:30.079 --> 46:34.250
I, I fear for Ann

46:34.334 --> 46:36.794
She must be warned

46:36.878 --> 46:39.714
McHenry is not

46:39.797 --> 46:42.342
Not what he seems

46:42.425 --> 46:45.094
-So charming that I
-Why?

46:45.178 --> 46:47.972
-A woman with sense
-Why come forward now?

46:48.056 --> 46:50.600
I quickly became

46:50.683 --> 46:53.019
A moth to a flame

46:53.102 --> 46:57.273
A moth to a flame

-NEWSMAN: The cause of this fire

47:21.798 --> 47:23.049
has not yet been determined,

47:23.132 --> 47:24.676
but Southern California Edison
utility

47:24.759 --> 47:27.470
did say that it started near
one of their power lines

47:27.554 --> 47:31.140
and they had not returned power
at the time the fire started.

49:50.196 --> 49:51.698
HENRY:
Fucking idiotic smoke.

49:54.701 --> 49:56.536
Have you no sense
of proportions?!

50:05.044 --> 50:08.798
Having to be funny here,
it’s like...

50:08.881 --> 50:11.259
...trying to enjoy a blow job
in a gas chamber.

50:12.719 --> 50:13.803
MAN:
Ah, man.

50:13.886 --> 50:15.805
MAN:
That was not funny, Henry.

50:26.232 --> 50:28.067
You’re right, not funny.

50:30.737 --> 50:31.821
I’m so...

50:34.574 --> 50:36.409
...too fucking tired.

50:47.170 --> 50:49.172

50:50.631 --> 50:53.468

AUDIENCE:
No, no, no!

50:56.053 --> 50:57.930
Yes, yes, yes.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.975
You see, my house was...

51:02.477 --> 51:04.645
...broken into last night,

51:04.729 --> 51:07.231
and, mm, bastards
stole all my jokes.

51:09.233 --> 51:10.651
No, the truth is...

51:13.362 --> 51:16.240
...now that I have
my own soprano

51:16.324 --> 51:19.160
-and baby...

51:20.912 --> 51:22.580
...I’m not sure I have it
in me anymore

51:22.663 --> 51:24.457
to make sad people laugh.

51:26.167 --> 51:29.003
No, the truth is, this morning,

51:29.086 --> 51:30.755
something happened.

51:32.089 --> 51:35.593
I-I... No, no, I can’t say.

51:35.676 --> 51:37.762
No, the truth is I’m sick.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.348
Being in love makes me sick.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.849
Sick!

51:46.395 --> 51:49.023
Well, the true truth is...

51:49.106 --> 51:50.525
this morning...

51:53.361 --> 51:54.779
I, um...

51:57.740 --> 51:59.659
I killed... my wife.

51:59.742 --> 52:01.828
-What? What was that?
-

52:01.911 --> 52:03.663
-WOMAN: Louder!
-MAN: Louder, Henry!

52:03.746 --> 52:06.082
-Can’t hear you back here.
-Your mic, Henry!

52:12.338 --> 52:14.090
I killed my wife.

52:21.347 --> 52:23.349
Yes, laugh, laugh, laugh.

52:24.392 --> 52:25.977
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.188
So, I’ve said it:

52:29.272 --> 52:31.023
I killed my wife.

52:33.734 --> 52:34.902
I didn’t mean to.

52:36.445 --> 52:38.447
God knows I didn’t mean to.

52:39.657 --> 52:41.617
She woke up,

52:41.701 --> 52:43.452
so beautiful.

52:45.705 --> 52:47.915
-She looked at me and smiled.

52:47.999 --> 52:49.917
That smile.

52:50.001 --> 52:53.254
She is-- was--
a very shy person, you see,

52:53.337 --> 52:56.841
and I know,
I knew this shy smile

52:56.924 --> 52:59.051
meant she wanted to fuck.

52:59.135 --> 53:01.888
But this time,
I pretended not to get it.

53:01.971 --> 53:05.683
And I kept on pretending
and so she said it,

53:05.766 --> 53:07.393
ever so shyly:

53:09.020 --> 53:10.438
"Please, Henry.

53:12.398 --> 53:13.816
Fuck me, Henry."

53:15.401 --> 53:17.904
And I could see the effort
in her smile,

53:17.987 --> 53:20.156
for her to ask that,

53:20.239 --> 53:22.199
to say those dirty words,

53:22.283 --> 53:25.912
to be wicked and bold,
so out of character.

53:25.995 --> 53:29.040
With that very shy smile
I loved so much.

53:29.123 --> 53:30.791
But I couldn’t answer,

53:30.875 --> 53:32.710
I couldn’t meet her desire.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.254
’Cause, yes,
being in love makes me sick.

53:35.338 --> 53:36.672
Sick!

53:36.756 --> 53:39.050
I had been sleepless
all night, you see,

53:39.133 --> 53:41.886
suffocating,
suffocated by love.

53:41.969 --> 53:43.179
A wreck.

53:43.262 --> 53:44.931
Absolutely no desire left.

53:45.014 --> 53:47.141
WOMAN:
Come on, Henry, drop it, please!

53:47.224 --> 53:49.393
-WOMAN: Yeah.
-

53:49.477 --> 53:52.021
What? Am I letting you know more
than you care to know about me?

53:52.104 --> 53:53.522
Mm-hmm.

53:56.150 --> 53:57.318
About her?

53:59.111 --> 54:00.279
Sex?

54:04.241 --> 54:05.326
Death?

54:08.454 --> 54:10.289
Yes, no desire left.

54:11.749 --> 54:13.084
Zero.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.253
So I was looking for something,

54:16.337 --> 54:19.298
anything to
change the subject,

54:19.382 --> 54:21.926
to spare us both this horrible,

54:22.009 --> 54:24.053
dreadful moment of rejection.

54:24.136 --> 54:26.764
That’s when the idea
came to me.

54:26.847 --> 54:30.309
I remembered how extremely
ticklish she is-- was--

54:30.393 --> 54:32.770
especially on the soles
of her feet.

54:32.853 --> 54:35.523
So I thought: I’ll tickle her,

54:35.606 --> 54:37.024
to change the subject.

54:37.108 --> 54:38.359
So I grabbed her legs,

54:38.442 --> 54:40.027
locked both of her feet
under my arms

54:40.111 --> 54:41.612
and started to tickle them.

54:43.990 --> 54:45.992
I could see in her eyes
she understood it all.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.620
Why I was doing
what I was doing

54:49.704 --> 54:51.205
to change the subject.

54:53.082 --> 54:55.418
And it seemed impossible
she would laugh this time.

54:55.501 --> 54:57.003
She was hurt.

54:58.838 --> 55:00.047
And sad and confused.

55:01.465 --> 55:03.884
But I persisted,
I tickled gently...

55:09.932 --> 55:11.434
"Stop it, Henry."

55:13.185 --> 55:14.812
It wasn’t working.

55:14.895 --> 55:16.313
So I tickled stronger.

55:23.279 --> 55:24.697
I tickled madly.

55:29.493 --> 55:30.786
I tickled wild.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.892
Ann?

55:53.934 --> 55:55.186
Ann.

55:56.979 --> 55:59.231
Ann? Ann!

56:07.615 --> 56:09.158
No, no, no, Ann!

56:12.161 --> 56:13.412
Ann!

56:14.622 --> 56:15.873
Ann!

56:17.374 --> 56:18.834
No!

56:21.420 --> 56:23.172
No, Ann!

56:28.094 --> 56:29.345
No!

56:42.108 --> 56:43.818
I had tickled her to death.

56:43.901 --> 56:46.904
-

56:51.617 --> 56:53.702
I then tried to kill myself.

56:53.786 --> 56:55.996
The same way, tickling myself.

57:08.968 --> 57:10.970
You know, but it didn’t work.

57:28.863 --> 57:31.198
This is how I killed my wife.

57:31.282 --> 57:32.950
WOMAN:
Enough. I’m out.

57:34.243 --> 57:35.661
MAN:
You’re sick!

57:39.832 --> 57:41.333
MAN:
That’s fucked up.

57:41.417 --> 57:43.127
AUDIENCE:
That was sick!

57:43.210 --> 57:44.670
You’re sick!

57:44.753 --> 57:46.005
Poor Ann!

57:46.088 --> 57:47.339
Poor Annette!

57:48.549 --> 57:50.050
HENRY:
I sense some animosity.

57:50.134 --> 57:51.385
Am I right, or is it me?

57:51.468 --> 57:54.346
You must’ve bitten something
bitter in your cradle!

57:54.430 --> 57:55.723
Bitten, bitter, cradle!

57:55.806 --> 57:57.725
So why did I become a comedian?

57:57.808 --> 57:59.393
You’re not! You’re not!

57:59.476 --> 58:00.519
Not anymore!

58:00.603 --> 58:02.271
So why did I become a comedian?

58:02.354 --> 58:03.689
Asshole! Asshole!

58:03.772 --> 58:05.316
Sick, sick, sick!

58:05.399 --> 58:07.818
-MAN: Asshole!
-Okay.

58:07.902 --> 58:10.154
-Go home!
-Ready?

58:10.237 --> 58:11.405
Laugh!

58:11.488 --> 58:14.992
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha, ha-ha

58:15.075 --> 58:18.329
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha

58:18.412 --> 58:21.332
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha, ha-ha

58:21.415 --> 58:22.917
We promised that you’d laugh

58:23.000 --> 58:24.627
We promised
that you’d laugh

58:24.710 --> 58:28.088
We promised that you’d
laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh

58:28.172 --> 58:30.674
-Laugh, laugh, laugh
-

58:30.758 --> 58:32.426
’Cause he’s Henry, he’s Henry...

58:32.509 --> 58:36.430
Okay, everybody, thank you
very much, but enough already.

58:36.513 --> 58:37.848
Have a good night!

58:37.932 --> 58:40.517
Kick the bucket, kick the
bucket, kick the bucket

58:40.601 --> 58:43.145
He needs to hear you
clap, clap, clap

58:43.229 --> 58:44.855
-

58:44.939 --> 58:47.816
’Cause he’s Henry, he’s Henry,
The Henry

58:58.410 --> 59:01.372
You used to laugh

59:01.455 --> 59:04.416
But now you sure ain’t laughing
at me no more

59:04.500 --> 59:06.001
You used to laugh

59:07.586 --> 59:10.422
But now you sure ain’t laughing
at me no more

59:10.506 --> 59:12.841
What’s your problem?

59:12.925 --> 59:15.344
What’s your fucking problem?

59:16.262 --> 59:19.014
What’s your problem?

59:19.098 --> 59:22.351
Your fucking problem?

59:22.434 --> 59:25.521
-Do you think I care?
-Henry, Henry, we’ve had enough

59:25.604 --> 59:28.357
Do you think I care
what you all think of me now?

59:28.440 --> 59:31.443
-Do you think I care?
-Henry, Henry, we’ve had enough

59:31.527 --> 59:34.363
Do you think I care
what you wimps think of me now?

59:34.446 --> 59:36.782
-What’s your problem?
-

59:36.865 --> 59:40.119
What’s your fucking problem?

59:40.202 --> 59:42.997
-What’s your problem?
-Henry, Henry, we’ve had enough

59:43.080 --> 59:45.666
-Your fucking problem?
-Henry, Henry, we’ve had enough

59:45.749 --> 59:47.918
My dear public

59:48.002 --> 59:49.628
Get off, get off,
get off the stage

59:49.712 --> 59:51.547
My dear public,

59:51.630 --> 59:52.756

59:55.467 --> 59:56.677

-Get off the stage
-Your fucking problem

1:00:08.355 --> 1:00:10.858
Get off, get off,
get off the stage

1:00:10.941 --> 1:00:14.111
Get off,
get off, get off the stage

1:00:14.194 --> 1:00:17.072
Get off, get off,
get off the stage

1:00:17.156 --> 1:00:19.325
Get off,
get off, get off the stage

1:00:19.408 --> 1:00:21.160
-Well, you better laugh
-Get off, get off

1:00:21.243 --> 1:00:22.661
Get off the stage

1:00:22.745 --> 1:00:25.414
Or I’ll get the hell

1:00:25.497 --> 1:00:27.458
-If you don’t laugh
-Get off, get off

1:00:27.541 --> 1:00:28.917
Get off the stage

1:00:29.001 --> 1:00:30.627
-You gonna feel, feel, feel
-Get off, get off

1:00:30.711 --> 1:00:31.879
-The fire of my rage
-Get off the stage

1:00:31.962 --> 1:00:33.130
We used to laugh

1:00:33.213 --> 1:00:34.715
HENRY: Fuck off, fuck off,
fuck out of here

1:00:34.798 --> 1:00:36.467
-Fuck off, fuck off
-Until we wised up

1:00:36.550 --> 1:00:38.093
-Fuck out of here
-Man, you’re sick as they come

1:00:38.177 --> 1:00:39.386
-Fuck off, fuck off
-We used to laugh

1:00:39.470 --> 1:00:40.888
Fuck out of here

1:00:40.971 --> 1:00:42.514
-Fuck off, fuck off
-But now we see you as you are

1:00:42.598 --> 1:00:44.141
-Fuck out of here
-You are scum

1:00:44.224 --> 1:00:46.060
-You got a problem
-What’s your problem?

1:00:46.143 --> 1:00:49.271
-A big old problem
-What’s your fucking problem?

1:00:49.355 --> 1:00:51.982
-You got a problem
-You’ve got a problem

1:00:52.066 --> 1:00:53.734
A big old problem

1:00:53.817 --> 1:00:58.572
-A big old pro...
-

1:00:58.655 --> 1:01:00.157
...blem!

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:12.544
Ha, ha!

1:01:12.628 --> 1:01:15.631
Ha, ha! Ha, ha!

1:01:16.423 --> 1:01:18.759
Ha, ha, ha!

1:01:18.842 --> 1:01:21.804
Goddamn it! Fucking damn it!

1:01:21.887 --> 1:01:23.889
Fuck!

1:01:24.723 --> 1:01:27.017
God, fuck, damn it, fuck!

1:01:33.399 --> 1:01:35.651
Henry, I’m worried about you.

1:01:37.653 --> 1:01:38.987
I’m worried.

1:01:43.158 --> 1:01:45.869
There was a girl

1:01:45.953 --> 1:01:49.289
From the middle of nowhere

1:01:50.958 --> 1:01:53.919
Utterly plain

1:01:54.002 --> 1:01:56.171
A little plump

1:01:58.715 --> 1:02:01.760
She sang alone

1:02:01.844 --> 1:02:04.847
In her bedroom

1:02:06.723 --> 1:02:09.435
Wild acclaim

1:02:09.518 --> 1:02:13.355
From those four walls

1:02:14.940 --> 1:02:19.153
But she didn’t want to be there

1:02:19.236 --> 1:02:23.031
She didn’t want to be there

1:02:23.115 --> 1:02:26.952
She didn’t want to be there

1:02:27.035 --> 1:02:30.038
At all

1:02:31.498 --> 1:02:34.501
She had the voice

1:02:34.585 --> 1:02:37.588
Of a goddess

1:02:39.381 --> 1:02:42.050
Strings, winds and horns

1:02:42.134 --> 1:02:44.803
Inside her chest

1:02:47.556 --> 1:02:50.434
Hour after hour

1:02:50.517 --> 1:02:54.521
She would struggle

1:02:54.605 --> 1:02:58.108
Till her voice became

1:02:58.192 --> 1:03:01.111
Her royal realm

1:03:03.238 --> 1:03:06.950
She wanted just to be there

1:03:07.034 --> 1:03:10.871
Only wanted to live there

1:03:10.954 --> 1:03:14.041
Really wanted to live there

1:03:14.124 --> 1:03:17.377
Forever more

1:03:19.546 --> 1:03:22.299
She headed west

1:03:22.382 --> 1:03:26.053
The wild direction

1:03:26.136 --> 1:03:30.057
No longer plain

1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:32.809
No longer plump

1:03:35.395 --> 1:03:39.066
The men were on her doorstep

1:03:39.149 --> 1:03:43.070
Many men were on her doorstep

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:46.365
Her voice had brought her beauty

1:03:46.448 --> 1:03:49.451
And set her free

1:03:51.453 --> 1:03:53.539
But she never listened
to those men

1:03:53.622 --> 1:03:55.249
-Who came and whispered:
-

1:03:55.332 --> 1:03:57.167
"You’re a flame to me,
a flame to me

1:03:57.251 --> 1:03:59.378
A flame to me, a flame to me"

1:03:59.461 --> 1:04:01.463
She was a queen,
didn’t need a king

1:04:01.547 --> 1:04:03.131
Who’d put her brand-new palace

1:04:03.215 --> 1:04:07.302
In jeopardy, in jeopardy,
in jeopardy

1:04:07.386 --> 1:04:13.392
A queen should never
be a moth to a flame

1:04:17.604 --> 1:04:20.190
I have a wonderful gift,

1:04:20.274 --> 1:04:22.359
and a beautiful child.

1:04:22.442 --> 1:04:24.027
People adore me,

1:04:24.111 --> 1:04:26.780
and I adore this man, but...

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:30.951
Something’s wrong.

1:04:44.631 --> 1:04:45.632
Annette.

1:04:54.391 --> 1:04:56.226
That’s it, Annette.

1:04:58.937 --> 1:05:04.693
Just keep right on walking

1:05:05.986 --> 1:05:11.867
One foot then the other

1:05:16.663 --> 1:05:20.876
La, la-la-la,

1:05:20.959 --> 1:05:24.796

1:06:10.550 --> 1:06:11.551
Whoo!

1:06:38.203 --> 1:06:40.789
HENRY:
What goes up

1:06:40.872 --> 1:06:43.458
Must come down

1:06:43.542 --> 1:06:47.462
-My star’s in decline
-

1:06:47.546 --> 1:06:48.964
Hah!

1:06:49.047 --> 1:06:51.675
Once profound

1:06:51.758 --> 1:06:54.428
For a clown

1:06:54.511 --> 1:06:59.266
My star’s in decline.

1:06:59.349 --> 1:07:01.560
-

1:07:04.271 --> 1:07:07.315
Connie O’Connor here
for "Show Bizz News"

1:07:07.399 --> 1:07:11.570
with exclusive news that Ann,
Henry and Baby Annette

1:07:11.653 --> 1:07:15.157
will be travelling
on their yacht next week.

1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:18.285
Could it be in the hope of
saving the couple’s marriage?

1:07:18.368 --> 1:07:20.245
And could the problems be due
in large part

1:07:20.328 --> 1:07:21.788
to the growing discrepancy

1:07:21.872 --> 1:07:23.457
between their
respective success?

1:07:23.540 --> 1:07:26.626
CHORUS: Respective success,
respective success

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:29.463
-CONNIE: We wish them the best.
-We wish them the best.

1:07:41.266 --> 1:07:44.311
CHORUS: A storm is rolling in,
a storm is rolling in

1:07:44.394 --> 1:07:47.314
A storm is rolling in,
a storm is rolling in

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:50.400
A storm is rolling in, a storm
is rolling in

1:07:50.484 --> 1:07:53.320
A storm is rolling in,
a storm is rolling in

1:07:53.403 --> 1:07:54.738
A storm is rolling in

1:07:54.821 --> 1:07:56.656
-A storm is rolling in
-

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:58.283
A storm is rolling in

1:08:09.544 --> 1:08:12.589
I will calm the sea

1:08:12.672 --> 1:08:15.050
Baby, don’t fear

1:08:15.133 --> 1:08:18.136
I will stop the storm

1:08:18.220 --> 1:08:20.597
Sleep, baby, sleep

1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:23.809
The world revolves round you

1:08:23.892 --> 1:08:29.314
My little innocent

1:08:31.900 --> 1:08:34.903
Sleep a perfect sleep

1:08:34.986 --> 1:08:37.447
I’m always here

1:08:37.531 --> 1:08:40.408
Dream a perfect dream

1:08:40.492 --> 1:08:42.911
-And never fear
-

1:08:42.994 --> 1:08:46.206
Thunder, rain nor lightning

1:08:46.289 --> 1:08:50.877
My little innocent

1:08:54.130 --> 1:08:59.719
All of the danger that I feel

1:08:59.803 --> 1:09:05.225
I will dispel it
with some magic

1:09:05.308 --> 1:09:10.772
Alakazam, I’ll change the reel

1:09:10.856 --> 1:09:16.361
Look at the happy family dancing

1:09:16.444 --> 1:09:19.573
We’ll look back and laugh

1:09:19.656 --> 1:09:22.075
That crazy night

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:24.995
As we walk a path

1:09:25.078 --> 1:09:27.497
Neath city lights

1:09:27.581 --> 1:09:30.792
The lights will shine on you

1:09:30.876 --> 1:09:36.756
My little innocent.

1:09:48.101 --> 1:09:50.854
-Henry!
-

1:09:50.937 --> 1:09:53.189
Henry!

1:09:53.273 --> 1:09:58.194
Henry, where are you?

1:10:08.914 --> 1:10:10.081
Henry?

1:10:12.459 --> 1:10:13.627
Henry?

1:10:15.378 --> 1:10:16.713
-Ann.

1:10:19.466 --> 1:10:20.967
Are you drunk, Henry?

1:10:21.885 --> 1:10:23.136
Whoa.

1:10:23.219 --> 1:10:24.804
I’m not that drunk.

1:10:24.888 --> 1:10:27.057
-Let’s waltz.
-

1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:29.893
But I’ll kill my voice out here.

1:10:29.976 --> 1:10:32.020
Henry, a storm is rolling in.

1:10:32.103 --> 1:10:33.271
I’m well aware of that, my dear.

1:10:33.355 --> 1:10:35.190
Let’s waltz in the storm!

1:10:35.273 --> 1:10:37.192
CHORUS: A storm is rolling in,
a storm is rolling in

1:10:37.275 --> 1:10:40.695
A storm is rolling in, a storm
is rolling in

1:10:40.779 --> 1:10:42.030
Henry, you’re drunk

1:10:42.113 --> 1:10:43.740
-Henry, you’re drunk
-A storm is rolling in

1:10:43.823 --> 1:10:45.367
-I’m not that drunk
-A storm is rolling in

1:10:45.450 --> 1:10:46.868
-I’m not that drunk
-

1:10:46.952 --> 1:10:49.913
Hey, where’s Annette?
Where did she go?

1:10:49.996 --> 1:10:52.916
Annette’s asleep,
she’s safe below

1:10:52.999 --> 1:10:56.336
Henry, you’re not the man I know

1:10:56.419 --> 1:10:57.671
I’m not that drunk

1:10:57.754 --> 1:11:01.049
I’m not that drunk,
I’m not that drunk

1:11:01.132 --> 1:11:02.634
-I’m not that drunk
-Henry,

1:11:02.717 --> 1:11:04.386
you’re not the man I know.

1:11:04.469 --> 1:11:06.638
We’ll catch our death
in this rain.

1:11:06.721 --> 1:11:08.682
Henry, stop fooling around.

1:11:08.765 --> 1:11:11.768
We could slip, we could drown.

1:11:13.687 --> 1:11:14.896
Whoa!

1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:17.357
-Henry, don’t fool around
-

1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:20.777
There’s a storm, settle down

1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:23.697
Careful, hey! What if we fell?

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:26.741
-No one could survive
these swells -

1:11:26.825 --> 1:11:29.995
You’re quite drunk,
let’s calm down

1:11:30.078 --> 1:11:33.081
When we’re safe,
you can be a clown

1:11:33.164 --> 1:11:36.334
What has gotten into you?

1:11:36.418 --> 1:11:39.504
-What has gotten into you?
-

1:11:40.547 --> 1:11:44.134
With this storm and this sea

1:11:44.217 --> 1:11:47.429
I feel scared, look at me

1:11:47.512 --> 1:11:50.140
Comfort me, hold me tight

1:11:50.223 --> 1:11:54.019
Oh, what a terrible,
terrible night

1:11:57.605 --> 1:11:59.357
My voice, Henry.

1:11:59.441 --> 1:12:01.484
Is nothing sacred to you?

1:12:01.568 --> 1:12:03.945
Oh, God knows
everything is to you.

1:12:04.029 --> 1:12:05.321
Always trumpeting values

1:12:05.405 --> 1:12:07.240
The sacred values

1:12:07.323 --> 1:12:10.326
-And then dying, dying
-

1:12:10.410 --> 1:12:12.162
Dying!

1:12:12.245 --> 1:12:14.289
And then bowing,
bowing, bowing

1:12:16.166 --> 1:12:18.418
-

1:12:23.131 --> 1:12:26.176
ANN:
Henry, stop it, stop it now!

1:12:26.259 --> 1:12:29.429
We’re gonna fall, gonna die!

1:12:29.512 --> 1:12:32.098
What has gotten into you?

1:12:32.182 --> 1:12:33.850
Think of Annette!

1:12:44.319 --> 1:12:47.489
Henry, help me! Pull me out!

1:12:47.572 --> 1:12:50.658
Where are you? Help!

1:12:50.742 --> 1:12:54.037
Henry, I’m almost out of air!

1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:56.956
There’s so little I can do

1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:59.834
There’s so little
I can do

1:12:59.918 --> 1:13:03.171
There’s so little I can do

1:13:03.254 --> 1:13:06.299
There’s so little
I can do

1:13:08.927 --> 1:13:12.013
There’s so little I can do

1:13:15.308 --> 1:13:19.479
There’s so little I can do.

1:14:18.288 --> 1:14:20.707
HENRY
We gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.

1:14:27.380 --> 1:14:32.051
We washed ashore

1:14:32.135 --> 1:14:34.637
Annette

1:14:34.721 --> 1:14:39.267
On some island

1:14:39.350 --> 1:14:44.105
Somewhere

1:14:46.441 --> 1:14:52.614
Your mother’s gone, Annette

1:14:54.073 --> 1:15:01.039
I’ll take care of you

1:15:03.875 --> 1:15:10.548
Help is on the way

1:15:10.632 --> 1:15:12.383
Annette

1:15:13.259 --> 1:15:16.804
Someone’s heard

1:15:16.888 --> 1:15:23.061
Our calls

1:15:23.144 --> 1:15:27.482
In the meantime

1:15:27.565 --> 1:15:31.402
Stars line up

1:15:32.528 --> 1:15:39.494
They line up for you

1:16:41.973 --> 1:16:44.809
-

1:16:44.892 --> 1:16:47.312
Somehow I’m imagining
Annette is singing.

1:16:49.564 --> 1:16:52.567
Just as the light of the moon

1:16:52.650 --> 1:16:54.485
lit her beautiful face.

1:16:55.611 --> 1:16:57.280
How foolish.

1:16:59.157 --> 1:17:00.950
How very foolish I can be.

1:17:04.370 --> 1:17:06.289
Now, I can hear the...

1:17:06.372 --> 1:17:08.958
stars laughing at me.

1:17:09.042 --> 1:17:11.669
In the morning I’ll be...

1:17:11.753 --> 1:17:14.380
free of all these
hallucinations.

1:17:50.416 --> 1:17:55.088
I will haunt you, Henry

1:17:56.422 --> 1:18:02.762
For the rest of your life

1:18:02.845 --> 1:18:08.518
Through Annette, I’ll haunt you

1:18:08.601 --> 1:18:14.774
Her voice will be my ghost

1:18:14.857 --> 1:18:19.570
I am no longer love

1:18:19.654 --> 1:18:25.743
I am now revenge

1:18:56.566 --> 1:19:01.487
I will haunt you, Henry

1:19:01.571 --> 1:19:07.869
I’ll die day after day after day

1:19:07.952 --> 1:19:14.083
I will haunt you, Henry

1:19:14.167 --> 1:19:21.007
Night after night after night.

1:19:26.679 --> 1:19:28.306
We are the police
and we have got

1:19:28.389 --> 1:19:30.141
-Some routine questions
-

1:19:30.224 --> 1:19:33.394
You’re not suspected, but
we have to ask some questions

1:19:33.478 --> 1:19:36.898
It won’t take long, how ’bout
some coffee with your questions?

1:19:36.981 --> 1:19:40.318
It won’t take long, we don’t
have very many questions

1:19:40.401 --> 1:19:41.986
Not many questions

1:19:42.069 --> 1:19:45.406
Can you describe the night
and how your wife went missing?

1:19:45.490 --> 1:19:48.034
There was a storm and I looked
up and she was missing

1:19:48.117 --> 1:19:51.913
And did you try at all
to dive in and to save her?

1:19:51.996 --> 1:19:55.583
The sea was rough, and with
Annette, how could I save her?

1:19:55.666 --> 1:19:59.045
The storm was very strong,
there was no way to save her

1:19:59.128 --> 1:20:02.590
And anyway, I had Annette,
I had to save her

1:20:03.591 --> 1:20:04.884
I had Annette.

1:20:04.967 --> 1:20:08.596
We heard the rumors
that you’re somewhat of a raver

1:20:08.679 --> 1:20:11.390
Were there some problems
between you that made you waver?

1:20:11.474 --> 1:20:15.478
That is an insult, I loved Ann,
was always faithful

1:20:15.561 --> 1:20:18.856
How ’bout that comic piece in
which you said you killed her?

1:20:18.940 --> 1:20:22.109
Was that a prank or
something more, an aspiration?

1:20:22.193 --> 1:20:25.238
Everybody knows my acts
are full of provocation

1:20:25.321 --> 1:20:29.075
Well, that ’bout wraps it up,
we sure are grateful, Henry

1:20:29.158 --> 1:20:32.620
It now seems clear to us
there is no guilty party

1:20:32.703 --> 1:20:35.915
It was an act of God,
that is our firm conclusion

1:20:35.998 --> 1:20:37.375
It was an act of God

1:20:37.458 --> 1:20:39.252
-And pardon the intrusion.
-

1:20:41.295 --> 1:20:43.714
-

1:20:45.550 --> 1:20:47.051
WOMAN:
Yeah, that’s him.

1:21:01.607 --> 1:21:05.695
Sure, I’ve sinned
in all your eyes

1:21:05.778 --> 1:21:10.866
But one thing you cannot deny is

1:21:10.950 --> 1:21:15.371
I’m a good father,
I’m a good father

1:21:15.454 --> 1:21:18.374
I’m a good father, am I?

1:21:19.750 --> 1:21:23.629
My Annette will ask someday

1:21:23.713 --> 1:21:26.549
-"Where is my mother?"
-GIRL: Mommy! Daddy!

1:21:26.632 --> 1:21:28.968
I will say that

1:21:29.051 --> 1:21:31.053
I’m a good father

1:21:31.137 --> 1:21:35.016
I’m a good father,
I’m a good father

1:21:35.099 --> 1:21:36.934
But she’s gone

1:21:37.727 --> 1:21:40.146
I’m a good father

1:21:40.229 --> 1:21:42.440
Mother and father

1:21:42.523 --> 1:21:45.735
-I’m a good father, am I?
-

1:22:00.333 --> 1:22:01.959
Hi, Consuelo.

1:22:02.043 --> 1:22:03.919
How’s my Baby Annette?

1:22:04.003 --> 1:22:06.339
Much better. No more fever.

1:22:06.422 --> 1:22:09.258
Oh, thank you so much.

1:22:09.342 --> 1:22:11.010
You’re welcome, Mr. McHenry.

1:22:12.511 --> 1:22:14.597
Uh... see you tomorrow?

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:16.432
Yes. Have a good evening.

1:22:16.515 --> 1:22:17.516
You, too.

1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:19.393
CONSUELO:
Bye-bye, my love.

1:22:27.234 --> 1:22:29.070
Look at what I got for you.

1:22:30.404 --> 1:22:32.698
-What is it?
-

1:22:33.658 --> 1:22:35.451
What is it, Annette?

1:22:37.244 --> 1:22:40.206
What is that?

1:22:40.289 --> 1:22:41.874
Look at that.

1:22:44.377 --> 1:22:45.878
Are you excited?

1:22:56.681 --> 1:22:58.265
Annette,
isn’t it magical that...

1:23:12.738 --> 1:23:14.240
Unbelievable

1:23:15.449 --> 1:23:16.701
Amazing

1:23:17.785 --> 1:23:19.912
It’s really happening

1:23:19.995 --> 1:23:22.540
She sings

1:23:22.623 --> 1:23:24.625
She’s a miracle

1:23:26.043 --> 1:23:29.588
When the light shines on her

1:23:29.672 --> 1:23:31.424
Astounding

1:23:31.507 --> 1:23:34.260
Unbelievable

1:23:34.343 --> 1:23:36.595
Amazing

1:23:40.433 --> 1:23:43.102
It’s really happening

1:23:44.687 --> 1:23:47.898
It’s really happening

1:23:47.982 --> 1:23:50.735
-To me.
-

1:24:16.427 --> 1:24:19.764
It’s a fast-changing world.

1:24:19.847 --> 1:24:24.435
And I am now the conductor
of the city’s finest orchestra.

1:24:24.518 --> 1:24:26.312
No longer
the self-deprecating accompanist

1:24:26.395 --> 1:24:28.230
from such a short while ago.

1:24:30.357 --> 1:24:32.359
Ann would be proud of me.

1:24:34.153 --> 1:24:38.574
I do have my suspicions, though,
about why she isn’t alive.

1:24:41.368 --> 1:24:42.995
And doubts, too,

1:24:43.078 --> 1:24:45.915
about something else, but...

1:24:45.998 --> 1:24:47.291
Excuse me a minute.

1:25:19.990 --> 1:25:24.161
Henry has invited me
to his place tomorrow...

1:25:24.245 --> 1:25:27.832
...to discuss a matter that he
says concerns Annette and Ann.

1:25:32.211 --> 1:25:35.506
As awkward as it is
for me to attend,

1:25:35.589 --> 1:25:39.426
anything that concerns Ann
and the future of Annette

1:25:39.510 --> 1:25:41.804
is something that concerns me.

1:25:43.180 --> 1:25:44.849
Excuse me one more time.

1:26:01.073 --> 1:26:03.075
My love for Ann has never died.

1:26:05.786 --> 1:26:08.622
Neither has my regret

1:26:08.706 --> 1:26:11.041
that our affair

1:26:11.125 --> 1:26:12.710
was only an affair.

1:26:15.296 --> 1:26:18.966
I had been hoping for so long.

1:26:19.049 --> 1:26:22.887
Then at a time when she was in
despair, we started an affair.

1:26:22.970 --> 1:26:25.472
But the very next week,
she met Henry.

1:26:25.556 --> 1:26:28.100
That was the end of it,
the end of me.

1:26:28.183 --> 1:26:29.852
I’ll always regret that.

1:26:29.935 --> 1:26:33.439
I deeply miss her--
her warmth, her voice.

1:26:33.522 --> 1:26:35.232
I miss Ann. Excuse me.

1:27:08.807 --> 1:27:10.142
THE CONDUCTOR:
Thank you.

1:27:22.404 --> 1:27:23.489
Hey, Henry.

1:27:23.572 --> 1:27:25.991
Thanks for coming by

1:27:26.075 --> 1:27:28.827
My Conductor friend

1:27:28.911 --> 1:27:31.455
Got something to show you

1:27:31.538 --> 1:27:34.124
That will blow your mind

1:27:34.208 --> 1:27:36.794
Follow me upstairs

1:27:36.877 --> 1:27:39.463
As a friend of mine

1:27:39.546 --> 1:27:41.882
You deserve to see this

1:27:41.966 --> 1:27:44.843
It will blow your mind

1:27:44.927 --> 1:27:47.554
Careful with the stairs

1:27:47.638 --> 1:27:50.057
Have no fear, my friend

1:27:50.140 --> 1:27:52.893
I’m not gonna play

1:27:52.977 --> 1:27:54.937
Any trick of mine

1:28:04.863 --> 1:28:07.241
-Henry, what are you do...
-Shh.

1:28:33.642 --> 1:28:34.810
Can you believe it?

1:28:34.893 --> 1:28:36.228
I just can’t believe it.

1:28:36.311 --> 1:28:38.480
-Can you explain it?
-I can’t explain it.

1:28:38.564 --> 1:28:41.316
-Is it really happening?
-I don’t know what to think.

1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:42.818
Is it really happening?

1:28:42.901 --> 1:28:44.528
I really don’t know
what to think.

1:28:44.611 --> 1:28:46.363
To us?

1:28:46.447 --> 1:28:48.490
-How ’bout a drink?
-I need a drink.

1:28:49.658 --> 1:28:50.868
A strong drink.

1:28:50.951 --> 1:28:54.246
HENRY: Here’s my plan,
my sweet Conductor

1:28:54.329 --> 1:28:56.915
We three travel round the world

1:28:56.999 --> 1:28:59.418
She performs with you conducting

1:28:59.501 --> 1:29:02.171
Backing her around the world

1:29:02.254 --> 1:29:04.882
All the world
deserves to see this

1:29:04.965 --> 1:29:07.509
It’s our moral duty, right?

1:29:07.593 --> 1:29:10.345
Well, what do you think,
Conductor?

1:29:10.429 --> 1:29:13.599
Am I wrong or am I right?

1:29:13.682 --> 1:29:16.226
If you would consent

1:29:16.310 --> 1:29:18.771
To be there for her

1:29:18.854 --> 1:29:21.565
Your fame will grow greater

1:29:21.648 --> 1:29:24.151
Two hundred percent

1:29:24.234 --> 1:29:26.779
We would tour the world

1:29:26.862 --> 1:29:29.531
Show her to the world

1:29:29.615 --> 1:29:32.117
Millions would go wild

1:29:32.201 --> 1:29:34.828
Cherishing the child

1:29:34.912 --> 1:29:37.456
This is really exploitation.

1:29:37.539 --> 1:29:39.625
-No, not really
-Sure it is.

1:29:39.708 --> 1:29:42.294
This is really exploitation.

1:29:42.377 --> 1:29:44.797
-No, not really
-Sure it is.

1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:47.674
You know what my future
looks like

1:29:47.758 --> 1:29:50.302
From a money point of view

1:29:50.385 --> 1:29:52.888
With the income from performance

1:29:52.971 --> 1:29:56.058
She could have a future, too

1:29:56.141 --> 1:29:58.102
-You’re exploiting her, Henry.
-No, not really.

1:29:58.185 --> 1:30:01.188
-You’re exploiting Annette.
-No, not really!

1:30:01.271 --> 1:30:03.732
Please make up your mind

1:30:03.816 --> 1:30:06.568
Please make up
your mind

1:30:06.652 --> 1:30:08.946
Please, Conductor friend

1:30:09.029 --> 1:30:11.156
We cannot waste time.

1:30:17.412 --> 1:30:19.790

1:30:43.355 --> 1:30:45.774
HENRY:
I have the same dream

1:30:47.025 --> 1:30:48.694
Every night

1:30:50.112 --> 1:30:52.614
Every night the same dream

1:30:56.493 --> 1:30:58.495
Adrift

1:30:59.788 --> 1:31:01.874
On an angry sea

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:06.879
And in a moment of rage

1:31:06.962 --> 1:31:08.463
And stupidity

1:31:09.715 --> 1:31:11.383
I kill

1:31:12.676 --> 1:31:14.678
The one I love

1:31:16.889 --> 1:31:20.893
Ann, forgive me

1:31:23.478 --> 1:31:24.730
Ann

1:31:26.732 --> 1:31:28.567
I beg you

1:31:30.027 --> 1:31:31.612
Ann

1:31:33.030 --> 1:31:39.119
Forgive me

1:31:49.213 --> 1:31:52.758
I have the same dream

1:31:52.841 --> 1:31:54.843
Every night

1:31:56.136 --> 1:31:59.306
Every night the same dream

1:32:02.351 --> 1:32:04.353
She’s here

1:32:05.604 --> 1:32:09.024
Lying by my side

1:32:09.107 --> 1:32:12.402
An exercise

1:32:12.486 --> 1:32:15.656
In futility

1:32:15.739 --> 1:32:18.742
Did I kill

1:32:18.825 --> 1:32:22.246
The one I love?

1:32:22.329 --> 1:32:27.584
There’s no forgiveness

1:32:29.086 --> 1:32:30.837
Ann

1:32:32.172 --> 1:32:35.384
I beg you

1:32:35.467 --> 1:32:38.637
There’s no

1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:41.348
Forgiveness...

1:33:42.409 --> 1:33:45.579
ANNOUNCER:
You’ve read about her

1:33:45.662 --> 1:33:48.665
You’ve heard about her

1:33:48.749 --> 1:33:51.376
But nothing will have
prepared you for

1:33:51.460 --> 1:33:54.713
What you’re about to see

1:33:55.630 --> 1:33:57.883
Nothing will have prepared you

1:33:57.966 --> 1:34:01.636
For what you’re
about to see and hear

1:34:02.637 --> 1:34:04.639

1:34:27.037 --> 1:34:29.539
I am Henry McHenry

1:34:38.173 --> 1:34:39.716
Cynics among you may doubt

1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:41.885
that what you’re about to see
is real.

1:34:43.428 --> 1:34:46.640
That it is not faked
in some way.

1:34:46.723 --> 1:34:48.558
Let me assure you it is real.

1:34:49.684 --> 1:34:52.521
Annette is a miracle.

1:34:54.815 --> 1:34:56.817
Miracles do exist.

Without further ado

beautiful night, huh?

1:39:59.619 --> 1:40:01.955
Hey, my friend, would you look
after Annette while I go out

1:40:02.038 --> 1:40:05.250
and let off just
a little bit of steam?

1:40:05.333 --> 1:40:07.752
Sure, Henry,
I’ll look after Annette.

1:40:38.158 --> 1:40:42.245
We love each other

1:40:42.328 --> 1:40:44.831
So much

1:40:50.003 --> 1:40:54.007
So hard to explain it

1:40:55.425 --> 1:40:58.845
So hard to explain

1:41:01.556 --> 1:41:04.893
We love each other

1:42:22.303 --> 1:42:25.139
All the girls I see

1:42:25.223 --> 1:42:27.684
Look so great to me

1:42:27.767 --> 1:42:30.603
What amazes me

1:42:30.687 --> 1:42:32.981
Is what they see in me

1:42:33.064 --> 1:42:36.234
All the girls I see

1:42:36.317 --> 1:42:39.112
In France and Italy

1:42:39.195 --> 1:42:41.531
Or here in Roppongi

1:42:41.614 --> 1:42:44.576
What do they see in me?

1:42:47.495 --> 1:42:49.163
Am I handsome? No

1:42:49.247 --> 1:42:50.290
You’re so handsome

1:42:50.373 --> 1:42:52.041
Charming? Well, so-so

1:42:52.125 --> 1:42:53.126
You’re so charming

1:42:53.209 --> 1:42:54.711
I’m a foreign guy

1:42:54.794 --> 1:42:55.879
So exotic

1:42:55.962 --> 1:42:58.631
Rich and drunk, maybe that’s why

1:42:58.715 --> 1:43:01.467
Hard to imagine

1:43:01.551 --> 1:43:04.220
All these fucking men

1:43:04.304 --> 1:43:06.931
Who hate themselves but

1:43:07.015 --> 1:43:09.684
Want us to love them

1:43:09.767 --> 1:43:12.437
-All the girls I see

1:43:12.520 --> 1:43:15.315
Look so great to me

1:43:15.398 --> 1:43:17.984
But will I ever be

1:43:18.067 --> 1:43:20.570
-Lovable again?
-

1:43:50.767 --> 1:43:53.353
I’m feeling
just a little bit drunk

1:43:54.896 --> 1:43:58.650
I’m feeling
just a little bit tipsy

1:43:58.733 --> 1:43:59.734
Shit.

1:43:59.817 --> 1:44:01.986
Where, you might ask, did I go?

1:44:03.613 --> 1:44:06.950
That would be
none of your business

1:44:08.493 --> 1:44:10.244
Where’d I put my house keys?

1:44:24.050 --> 1:44:26.302
So glad to be back at home

1:44:28.179 --> 1:44:31.516
Hey, Mr. Conductor friend,
good to see you

1:44:32.642 --> 1:44:34.394
Thanks for watching Annette

1:44:36.688 --> 1:44:38.398
How is Annette?

1:44:38.481 --> 1:44:39.649
She’s fine.

1:44:41.275 --> 1:44:44.028
There’s my little Annette

1:44:45.363 --> 1:44:48.533
There’s my little Annette

1:44:49.534 --> 1:44:51.869
How’s my little Annette?

1:44:53.663 --> 1:44:56.499
How’s my little Annette?

1:45:25.903 --> 1:45:27.280
How does she know that song?

1:45:27.363 --> 1:45:29.198
You had no right

1:45:29.282 --> 1:45:31.576
You had no right
to teach her that

1:45:31.659 --> 1:45:33.369
You had no right

1:45:33.453 --> 1:45:35.246
You had no right at all

1:45:35.329 --> 1:45:37.498
You had no right

1:45:37.582 --> 1:45:40.084
You had no right
to teach her that

1:45:40.168 --> 1:45:41.586
You had no right

1:45:41.669 --> 1:45:44.213
You had no right at all

1:45:44.297 --> 1:45:47.300
That song was our song,
Ann’s and my song

1:45:47.383 --> 1:45:50.261
That was our song,
that song was our song

1:45:50.344 --> 1:45:52.597
Ann’s song and mine

1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:55.683
That was our song

1:45:56.768 --> 1:45:59.771
That was our song

1:46:00.772 --> 1:46:02.106
No!

1:46:02.190 --> 1:46:06.444
No, Henry,
I wrote that song for Ann.

1:46:06.527 --> 1:46:07.862
What?

1:46:07.945 --> 1:46:11.032
So I had every right to teach it
to my star pupil, Annette.

1:46:11.115 --> 1:46:13.534
HENRY:
Yeah, bullshit.

1:46:13.618 --> 1:46:17.246
You’d think you were her father

1:46:17.330 --> 1:46:20.917
You’d think you were her father

1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.961
You’d think you were her father

1:46:24.045 --> 1:46:26.297
Maybe... I am.

1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:28.382
I think I am.

1:46:28.466 --> 1:46:32.178
This can’t be true,
this can’t be true

1:46:32.261 --> 1:46:33.679
Sorry, Henry.

1:46:33.763 --> 1:46:36.474
You see, before you came along,
Ann and I...

1:46:36.557 --> 1:46:38.101
This can’t be true

1:46:38.184 --> 1:46:40.103
Could this be true?

1:46:40.186 --> 1:46:44.816
No one must know this
or I’ll lose my daughter

1:46:44.899 --> 1:46:46.651
No one must know this

1:46:46.734 --> 1:46:49.904
Or I’ll lose my child

1:47:03.459 --> 1:47:05.753
Well, let’s put Annette to bed

1:47:05.837 --> 1:47:08.548
and then go by the pool
and talk it over, okay?

1:47:40.830 --> 1:47:42.498
Good night, Annette.

1:48:10.693 --> 1:48:12.195
You see, my friend...

1:48:17.325 --> 1:48:20.328
Henry, don’t fool around

1:48:21.579 --> 1:48:23.581
The water must be freezing.

1:48:23.664 --> 1:48:25.374
You wouldn’t want me to...

1:48:25.458 --> 1:48:28.169
drown, would you?

1:48:28.252 --> 1:48:29.503
I don’t know.

1:48:31.047 --> 1:48:32.548
What was I about to say?

1:48:32.632 --> 1:48:34.592
Shall we talk

1:48:34.675 --> 1:48:36.636
As you’d asked?

1:48:36.719 --> 1:48:40.848
I can’t stay,
can you make it fast?

1:48:40.932 --> 1:48:44.602
Not to be impolite

1:48:44.685 --> 1:48:48.314
But it’s been a long, long night

1:48:48.397 --> 1:48:51.067
Hey! Henry, no!

1:48:51.150 --> 1:48:53.569
Stop fooling around.

1:48:53.653 --> 1:48:55.404
You’re quite drunk

1:48:55.488 --> 1:48:57.490
Let’s both sit down

1:48:57.573 --> 1:49:00.826
What is it you need to say?

1:49:01.786 --> 1:49:03.287
Sit down, Henry

1:49:03.371 --> 1:49:04.747
Oh! Watch it! Hey!

1:49:04.830 --> 1:49:06.499
Shh!

1:49:06.582 --> 1:49:08.292
Okay, this isn’t funny anymore.

1:49:08.376 --> 1:49:10.294
-Not the least bit
funny anymore! -Shh!

1:49:10.378 --> 1:49:11.504
-Get your hands off me.
-Shh!

1:49:11.587 --> 1:49:12.713
Get your hands off of me.

1:49:12.797 --> 1:49:14.048
What are you trying to do to me?

1:49:14.131 --> 1:49:15.132
What are you trying--

1:49:15.216 --> 1:49:16.717
What are you trying to do to me?

1:49:16.801 --> 1:49:18.094
Stop it. Just stop it.

1:49:18.177 --> 1:49:19.887
Just stop it, stop it, stop it.

1:49:19.971 --> 1:49:22.682
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

1:49:22.765 --> 1:49:23.808
Stop it.

1:49:23.891 --> 1:49:25.351
Oh! Stop, stop.

1:49:30.022 --> 1:49:32.733
Henry, it’s freezing

1:49:32.817 --> 1:49:37.238
Hen... ry, I’m going down

1:49:39.532 --> 1:49:42.660
I won’t tell a single soul

1:49:42.743 --> 1:49:46.372
Even you can’t be this cold

1:49:49.625 --> 1:49:52.378
So it was you

1:49:52.461 --> 1:49:53.713
After all

1:49:53.796 --> 1:49:54.880
No.

1:50:01.762 --> 1:50:02.847
No.

1:50:06.809 --> 1:50:08.769
If only

1:50:08.853 --> 1:50:12.315
I had gotten Ann

1:50:12.398 --> 1:50:13.524
To love me more

1:50:16.027 --> 1:50:19.822
There’s so little I can do

Night after night after night.

2:04:00.809 --> 2:04:03.061
-

2:04:07.149 --> 2:04:10.152
-

2:04:12.946 --> 2:04:14.823
-

2:04:21.580 --> 2:04:23.832
HENRY
It’s incredible.

2:05:40.659 --> 2:05:42.285
Annette.

2:05:42.369 --> 2:05:43.370
Annette?

2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:51.002
You’ve changed so much, Annette.

2:05:52.379 --> 2:05:53.380
ANNETTE:
Yes.

2:05:58.093 --> 2:06:00.262
Yes, I have.

2:06:33.003 --> 2:06:35.005
You, too, have changed.

2:06:37.507 --> 2:06:41.553
But at least
you’re safe here, yes?

2:06:41.636 --> 2:06:45.390
You can’t drink and you can’t
smoke here, can you?

2:06:46.766 --> 2:06:48.768
No. No, I can’t.

2:06:51.229 --> 2:06:55.233
And you can’t kill here,
can you?

2:06:57.444 --> 2:07:01.031
It was a joke.

2:07:01.114 --> 2:07:03.366
Mm, you are my daughter
after all.

2:07:05.535 --> 2:07:07.037
No.

2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:08.538
No more killing.

2:07:09.622 --> 2:07:10.874
Only time.

2:07:12.959 --> 2:07:15.295
"Killing time."
Have you heard that expression?

2:07:15.378 --> 2:07:16.379
No.

2:07:18.006 --> 2:07:21.009
But now,
you have nothing to love.

2:07:22.469 --> 2:07:24.137
Can’t I love you?

2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:26.931
No.

2:07:27.015 --> 2:07:28.350
Not really.

2:07:36.816 --> 2:07:38.068
Annette.

2:07:41.821 --> 2:07:43.239
We don’t have long.

2:07:56.419 --> 2:08:00.632
I’ll sing these words to you

2:08:00.715 --> 2:08:04.969
I hope that they’ll ring true

2:08:05.053 --> 2:08:07.889
They’re not some magic chimes

2:08:09.307 --> 2:08:11.976
To cover up my crimes

2:08:13.478 --> 2:08:15.480
Annette, of this I’m sure

2:08:15.563 --> 2:08:18.358
Imagination’s strong

2:08:18.441 --> 2:08:20.610
And reason’s song

2:08:20.693 --> 2:08:22.862
Is weak and thin

2:08:22.946 --> 2:08:24.739
We don’t have long

2:08:26.324 --> 2:08:28.827
I stood upon a cliff

2:08:30.662 --> 2:08:33.289
A deep abyss below

2:08:34.874 --> 2:08:37.335
Compelled to look, I tried

2:08:37.419 --> 2:08:39.462
To fight it off

2:08:39.546 --> 2:08:42.799
God knows I tried

2:08:42.882 --> 2:08:45.468
This horrid urge to look below

2:08:45.552 --> 2:08:48.138
But half horrified

2:08:48.221 --> 2:08:50.306
And half relieved

2:08:50.390 --> 2:08:52.475
I cast my eyes

2:08:52.559 --> 2:08:54.561
Toward the abyss

2:08:54.644 --> 2:08:56.646
The dark abyss

2:09:04.237 --> 2:09:08.408
I heard a ringing in my ears

2:09:08.491 --> 2:09:12.704
I knew my death knell’s
ugly sound

2:09:12.787 --> 2:09:17.125
-The overbearing urge to gaze

2:09:17.208 --> 2:09:21.337
Into the deep abyss, the haze

2:09:21.421 --> 2:09:24.132
So strong the yearning
for the fall

2:09:24.215 --> 2:09:26.885
Imagination’s strong

2:09:26.968 --> 2:09:29.053
And reason’s song

2:09:29.137 --> 2:09:31.139
Is weak and thin

2:09:31.222 --> 2:09:33.391
We don’t have long

2:09:33.475 --> 2:09:35.852
I’ll never sing again

2:09:35.935 --> 2:09:38.104
Shunning all lights at night

2:09:38.188 --> 2:09:40.148
I’ll never sing again

2:09:40.231 --> 2:09:42.317
Smashing every lamp I see

2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:44.444
I’ll never sing again

2:09:44.527 --> 2:09:46.738
Living in full darkness

2:09:46.821 --> 2:09:50.366
I’ll never sing again

2:09:50.450 --> 2:09:53.077
A vampire forever

2:09:53.161 --> 2:09:54.996
Annette, no.

2:09:56.206 --> 2:09:57.373
No, no.

2:09:58.541 --> 2:10:02.045
Annette, Annette.

2:10:02.128 --> 2:10:03.129
No.

2:10:05.048 --> 2:10:06.257
I sang these words to you

2:10:06.341 --> 2:10:09.302
Can I forgive
what you have done?

2:10:09.385 --> 2:10:10.845
I hope, that they’d ring true

2:10:10.929 --> 2:10:13.723
And will I ever forgive Mom?

2:10:13.806 --> 2:10:15.225
Imagination is so strong

2:10:15.308 --> 2:10:17.310
Her deadly poison, I became

2:10:17.393 --> 2:10:19.312
And reason’s song
is never strong

2:10:19.395 --> 2:10:21.773
Merely a child to exploit

2:10:21.856 --> 2:10:24.359
Imagination is so strong

2:10:24.442 --> 2:10:25.860
Forgive you both?

2:10:25.944 --> 2:10:27.987
-And reason’s song
-Forget you both?

2:10:28.071 --> 2:10:29.906
-So faint and shrill
-To take that oath?

2:10:29.989 --> 2:10:34.118
-I stood above the deep abyss
-To take that oath?

2:10:34.202 --> 2:10:38.373
Why should I now forgive?
Why should I now forget?

2:10:38.456 --> 2:10:42.627
I can never forgive,
I can never forget

2:10:42.710 --> 2:10:45.505
Both of you were using me
for your own ends

2:10:45.588 --> 2:10:47.090
For your own ends

2:10:47.173 --> 2:10:48.883
Not an ounce of shame

2:10:48.967 --> 2:10:51.594
The two of you,
you’re both to blame

2:10:51.678 --> 2:10:54.847
I wish that both of you
were gone

2:10:54.931 --> 2:10:56.724
Wish you were gone

2:10:56.808 --> 2:10:58.935
-No, don’t blame Ann
-Wish you were gone

2:10:59.018 --> 2:11:01.145
-Annette, that’s wrong
-Wish you were gone

2:11:01.229 --> 2:11:04.607
-No, don’t blame Ann
-Both of you gone

2:11:04.691 --> 2:11:06.734
But is forgiveness the sole way

2:11:06.818 --> 2:11:08.778
This horrid urge to look below

2:11:08.861 --> 2:11:10.863
When all has gone so far astray

2:11:10.947 --> 2:11:12.824
God knows I tried
to fight it off

2:11:12.907 --> 2:11:14.367
-Extract the poison
-Half horrified

2:11:14.450 --> 2:11:16.286
-From one’s heart
-And half relieved

2:11:16.369 --> 2:11:18.329
-And from one’s soul
-I cast my eyes

2:11:18.413 --> 2:11:21.624
-I can’t be sure
-Down the abyss

2:11:21.708 --> 2:11:24.752
Forgive the two of you or not

2:11:24.836 --> 2:11:27.005
-I take this oath
-Sympathy for

2:11:27.088 --> 2:11:29.048
-Forgive you both?
-The dark abyss

2:11:29.132 --> 2:11:31.259
-I take this oath
-Sympathy for

2:11:31.342 --> 2:11:33.761
-I take this oath
-The dark abyss

2:11:33.845 --> 2:11:35.513
Forgive you both?

2:11:35.597 --> 2:11:37.932
-Or forget you both?
-Don’t cast your eyes

2:11:38.016 --> 2:11:40.351
-I must be strong
-Down the abyss

2:11:40.435 --> 2:11:42.729
-I must be strong
-Annette, please don’t

2:11:44.063 --> 2:11:46.524
GUARD:
Time’s up.

2:11:47.692 --> 2:11:49.193
No contact.

2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:57.869
And now you have nothing to love

2:11:57.952 --> 2:11:59.662
Why can’t I love you?

2:11:59.746 --> 2:12:00.747
Can’t I love you?

2:12:00.830 --> 2:12:06.252
Now you have nothing to love

2:12:06.336 --> 2:12:08.671
Can’t I love you, Annette?

2:12:08.755 --> 2:12:13.593
No, not really, Daddy

2:12:13.676 --> 2:12:16.220
It’s sad but it’s true

2:12:17.263 --> 2:12:22.852
Now you having nothing to love

2:12:28.733 --> 2:12:30.568
-Annette.
-

2:12:30.652 --> 2:12:32.779
My Annette.

2:12:32.862 --> 2:12:35.198
Never cast your eyes
down the abyss.

2:12:42.205 --> 2:12:45.041
HENRY:
Goodbye
