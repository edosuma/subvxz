WEBVTT

00:56.090 --> 00:58.692
Marquis!

00:58.825 --> 00:59.793
There you are.

01:02.696 --> 01:06.100
No!

01:07.301 --> 01:09.703
Dad! No! No!

01:09.836 --> 01:11.038
Please! Help!

01:40.533 --> 01:42.502
- Marq!
- Babe?

01:43.971 --> 01:45.872
- Babe?
- I have been pounding this door

01:46.007 --> 01:48.541
for the last ten minutes.
There's something wrong with the knob.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.378
Yeah, it's jammed.
What did you do now?

01:50.510 --> 01:53.247
Marq, don't start with me.
I am late. Just break it down.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.316
This a Belgian,
imported, $1500 door.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.319
There is no scenario short
of fire or global catastrophe

01:58.452 --> 02:01.088
in which I'm gonna use my foot
to kick down a $1500 door.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.125
- I don't care how much the door costs.
- $1500.

02:04.258 --> 02:07.328
- 1500? Just break down the door.
- Uh, I'm gonna go call a locksmith, okay?

02:07.461 --> 02:10.530
- No, wait, Marq! You break down this damn door!
- I'm gonna be right back.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.099
Right now,
or I swear to God!

02:12.233 --> 02:15.602
- Marq!
- I'm on the phone right now, okay?

02:15.735 --> 02:18.906
I'm talking to the locksmith. They said
there's only four people ahead of us.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.541
- Be like three hours. That's all.
- Marq, come on!

02:21.674 --> 02:24.544
This is very important.
I can't be late for this meeting.

02:24.677 --> 02:28.149
I'm sorry. I'm on the phone still, okay?
So I can't hear you.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.717
Marq? Goddamn you, Marq.

02:39.592 --> 02:42.163
What? I mean, hey, hey.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.067
Will you marry me?

02:46.200 --> 02:50.570
Marquis T. Woods,
I hate you.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.342
But thank you
for rescuing me.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.412
Anytime.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.481
I love that butt!

03:06.220 --> 03:08.923
Fight. I want to fucking fight.

03:09.056 --> 03:12.692
And when I say "I", I mean you,
my messenger of fucking doom.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.861
Marquis T. fucking Woods.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.565
My personal goddamn gladiator.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.101
But has he lost his bite?

03:20.234 --> 03:24.205
Don't think for one second, that just because
the majority of the plaintiffs in this case

03:24.338 --> 03:26.207
happen to be "my people,"

03:26.340 --> 03:29.709
that I don't plan on taking that
ball straight to their end zone

03:29.843 --> 03:33.347
and cramming that ball down
the throats of their attorneys.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.049
And that doesn't bother you?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.851
Bother me?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.487
Though the plaintiffs are black,

03:39.619 --> 03:42.356
their attorneys are white.
Correction: lily white.

03:42.490 --> 03:46.193
This is a class-action lawsuit
of some public delicacy,

03:46.327 --> 03:49.796
so we must deal with it
delicately.

03:50.864 --> 03:54.034
Why use fists when we've
not yet exhausted words?

03:54.168 --> 03:58.072
You're right, Marquis.
As always.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.474
That's why I love you.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.409
Except I don't do it
for your love.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.744
No, Wyman.
I do it for your money.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.348
Cha-ching, dear friend.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.656
<i>Mr. Woods, an Otis Peeley,
Esquire, on the line for you.</i>

04:16.789 --> 04:20.693
Don't know if I'm familiar with an
attorney by that name, Peeley...

04:20.827 --> 04:24.864
- What does he want?
- <i>Family matter, he said. He's calling from Kentucky.</i>

04:29.570 --> 04:33.174
- Put him through.
- <i>Yes, sir. Transferring him now.</i>

04:33.307 --> 04:36.709
<i>Good day, Mr. Woods.
Thank you for taking my call.</i>

04:36.843 --> 04:39.980
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad
news about your father.</i>

04:40.948 --> 04:42.416
<i>He's passed away.</i>

04:42.550 --> 04:45.252
<i>I sure am sorry
to give you this news,</i>

04:45.386 --> 04:47.054
<i>but you are listed
as the next of kin</i>

04:47.188 --> 04:48.721
<i>and there are matters
of his estate</i>

04:48.855 --> 04:50.391
<i>that need to be resolved.</i>

04:50.524 --> 04:54.894
You don't talk about him
very much. What was he like?

04:56.763 --> 05:00.234
Ah, you know, I haven't seen
him since I was a kid, baby.

05:00.367 --> 05:04.038
Not since I ran away from
Appalachia and didn't look back.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.773
Let's say...
he wasn't a kind man.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.275
Just...

05:10.177 --> 05:12.112
stuck in time
a little bit.

05:12.246 --> 05:14.315
It'll be good for you
to get this closure, Marq.

05:14.448 --> 05:17.084
This place sounds more than
just a little stuck in time.

05:17.218 --> 05:19.386
They even got electricity
out there?

05:19.520 --> 05:22.556
- Elec-what?
- And indoor plumbing, right?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.024
They even got black people?

05:24.158 --> 05:25.559
Okay, that's enough.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.828
This man was your dad's father.

05:28.963 --> 05:32.333
So, this weekend's
pickup game, workout,

05:32.466 --> 05:35.603
dance class, hang out with your
homies, whatever it is,

05:35.735 --> 05:39.373
deem it canceled,
because we are all going up there

05:39.506 --> 05:43.310
to pay our final respects,
and that's all there is to it.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.413
Okay, change
of subject matter.

05:46.547 --> 05:50.251
Ty, let's talk about this kid
that's been bullying you at school.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.452
Huh?

05:59.360 --> 06:02.596
So, Ty,
tell me what's going on.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.934
Social media shit, Dad.
You wouldn't understand.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.536
I think I do understand
quite well.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.273
Look, always remember,
you talk to your teachers,

06:12.406 --> 06:14.774
but whatever you do,
don't fight.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.344
That's just what
they expect from us.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.180
Now, you see, baby?
That was easy.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.057
It's beautiful.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.926
What do you say
we listen to some music?

07:07.928 --> 07:11.198
Any requests?
Anything y'all want to hear? Not hear?

07:12.099 --> 07:15.536
Sam? Ty?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.342
All right.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.481
Ah!

07:27.614 --> 07:29.849
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

07:32.252 --> 07:36.790
Kids, I used to sing this
to your mama.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.694
Yeah!

07:40.828 --> 07:42.162
Sing it, V.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.031
<i>♪ 'Cause you're mine ♪</i>

07:49.203 --> 07:51.105
<i>♪ 'Cause you're mine ♪</i>

08:41.021 --> 08:42.256
Ah!

08:47.461 --> 08:48.629
Whew!

08:50.397 --> 08:53.100
Son, ladder. The big one.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.068
Diesel.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.237
Gotta love it.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.309
Dad, how did you even know
this place was here?

09:02.443 --> 09:04.445
Well, son, they got apps
for everything.

09:04.578 --> 09:07.214
I bet this place doesn't
even exist on a map.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.084
Look, real talk,
your pops is a straight-up bush pilot.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.754
I could navigate by using
the stars if I had to.

09:13.887 --> 09:19.426
And this plane right here?
This is what we call old school.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.297
- Right, baby?
- Damn, it is hot.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.704
Okay, this was nice.

09:30.838 --> 09:34.842
I'll be in the plane writing in my
journal, if anyone's looking for me.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.413
- I'm gonna hit the head. Anybody need anything?
- Mm-mm.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.235
Are you kidding me?

10:10.912 --> 10:13.547
Whoa, shit. Dammit...

10:20.354 --> 10:24.224
Hey. Yo, brother,
any service around here?

10:24.358 --> 10:26.593
Slavery times is over.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.796
Pump your own damn gas.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.567
Oh.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.507
No.

10:40.641 --> 10:41.642
Let me see.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.913
- Uh...
- Damn, I ain't gonna steal it.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.180
I just wanna look at it.

10:52.519 --> 10:57.791
Hey, a mojo bag. I ain't seen
one of them since I was a kid.

10:58.927 --> 11:02.964
But even then,
I wasn't too sure what it was.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.298
Luck, man.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.034
- Luck.
- Yeah, luck.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.602
- You ever heard of it?
- Well, sure, I heard of luck.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.405
- Protection?
- Protection from what?

11:11.538 --> 11:15.509
From folks looking
to conjure your ass.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.180
You must be rich.

11:22.917 --> 11:24.618
How much that cost you?

11:27.055 --> 11:28.655
I... I don't know, really.

11:29.756 --> 11:32.125
You got it,
but you ain't know how much it costs?

11:39.433 --> 11:42.636
My, uh...
My dad bought it for me.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.171
Shit.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.639
There we go.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.242
Let's see there. Okay.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.445
And you can keep
the change there, Pop.

11:52.613 --> 11:55.682
Oh, and I need the facilities.
I gotta take a leak.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.584
Privy's out back.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.754
With a quarter moon
on the door, right?

12:05.559 --> 12:09.863
It's been nice, uh, talking to you,
getting to know you. You have a good day.

12:09.998 --> 12:13.634
You ain't headed with that airplane
up into yonder foothills, is you?

12:15.069 --> 12:18.940
- Yeah.
- And you ain't wanna be taking a mess of these along with you?

12:19.073 --> 12:21.208
No, I'm cool. Thank you.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.644
I don't believe
in that stuff.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.912
Suit yourself.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.683
- Can I have my phone back?
- What's up with your hand?

12:29.816 --> 12:31.852
Oh, this?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.622
Busted it playing ball.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.824
Funny thing, though,
after it healed?

12:37.959 --> 12:42.596
Boom, Steph Curry all day.
Jump shot's money.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.637
Damn.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.074
He really do have one.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.574
Huh.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.389
Fuck that.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.892
So what y'all doing
up around here?

13:12.026 --> 13:14.996
Funeral. My grandfather's.

13:15.129 --> 13:17.131
I never met him.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.466
I ain't heard of no one
dying around here.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.802
No, further up that way.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.413
Yeah, I best be gettin'.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.882
Before them fish
quit to jump.

13:36.017 --> 13:39.319
And next time you want
some service around here,

13:39.453 --> 13:41.888
get you a 5G phone.

13:42.023 --> 13:45.559
It's been years since we
got 4Gs or 3Gs around here.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.866
Country-ass nigga.

13:53.734 --> 13:54.768
What?

13:56.536 --> 13:58.405
What did you just say?

13:58.538 --> 14:01.675
I do not want to hear you use that
word again, do you understand me?

14:02.509 --> 14:05.679
Yeah. I mean, Dad uses it.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.347
It's every other word
on his playlist.

14:07.481 --> 14:09.483
Please. I am talking about
"country-ass."

14:09.616 --> 14:11.651
Don't do that,
hating other black folk.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.955
At some point,
we were all country.

14:14.088 --> 14:16.323
I do not want to hear that word
come out of your mouth.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.593
- Yes, ma'am.
- Damn right, "Yes, ma'am."

14:19.726 --> 14:22.629
Now get your sorry ass
back in that plane.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.912
Now you know there was no way I was gonna
let my delicate derriere touch that.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.949
Let's just get going.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.786
Oh...

14:47.621 --> 14:52.826
No, no, you gotta be kidding me.
You just... just hang tight. Be cool, okay?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.333
Open the door.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.937
Open the door.

15:10.343 --> 15:14.282
Good day to you. I'm aware that the
civil aviation code here in West Virginia

15:14.414 --> 15:17.684
stipulates that it's legal for
any private jet, single engine,

15:17.818 --> 15:21.989
to land on any open strip of landing
area, private or otherwise.

15:22.123 --> 15:23.323
Baby, you wanna?

15:23.456 --> 15:25.826
The paper states it
right here, sir.

15:26.827 --> 15:28.495
Here it is, right here.

15:31.098 --> 15:34.302
Well, legal or not,

15:34.434 --> 15:37.271
don't get much plane traffic
through here.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.640
Thought I'd stop by and make
sure everything was copacetic.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.045
So, where y'all headed today?

15:44.178 --> 15:45.579
Cypress Ridge.

15:47.982 --> 15:51.551
Well, if there's nothing else,
we'd like to get on our way.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.188
Obviously, there's
a big storm a-brewing,

15:54.322 --> 15:57.325
and I would just like to get my
beautiful family up top before that hits.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.792
"Y'all have a nice day."

15:58.926 --> 16:01.929
All right, y'all have
a nice day now.

16:02.063 --> 16:04.497
Tydon.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.135
- I say something?
- No, Sheriff, just kids having fun, that's all.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.505
You understand.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.085
Well, I hope everyone enjoyed their
first brush with the local color.

16:58.219 --> 17:00.520
Dad, seriously,
this place is a creep show.

17:00.654 --> 17:02.789
Come on, Sam,
it ain't that bad.

17:02.924 --> 17:06.493
I bet there's a million billion inbred
hillbillies watching up at us right now.

17:06.626 --> 17:10.131
Stroking it.
And I ain't talking no banjo, Sam.

17:10.264 --> 17:12.899
Tydon, I have had just
about enough from you today.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.105
Is something going on?

17:19.140 --> 17:20.607
So what happened?
What did he say?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.243
It doesn't matter
what he said.

17:22.376 --> 17:23.810
Kids, put your headphones on.

17:23.945 --> 17:26.680
I said put your headphones on.

17:29.216 --> 17:33.387
You want me to land the plane, pull off my belt,
go 12 rounds with the kid like my dad did?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.323
Is that what you want?

17:36.223 --> 17:38.491
Of course not, Marq.
But the way you treat them,

17:38.625 --> 17:40.194
they're becoming
entitled jerks.

17:40.328 --> 17:44.265
Give me a break. Because I give
my kids what I could never have?

17:44.398 --> 17:45.765
And you turned out
just fine, Marq.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.903
Veora, I didn't turn out
just fine. Okay?

17:49.036 --> 17:52.974
If I had my way, your son and daughter
would spend their lives in a boardroom,

17:53.107 --> 17:56.609
not in some jungle that I
couldn't get out of fast enough.

17:58.346 --> 18:00.281
Except sometimes, Marq,

18:01.115 --> 18:03.384
that jungle comes back
to find you,

18:03.516 --> 18:06.653
no matter what boardroom
you're hiding in.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.890
- Whoa!
- Dad?

18:11.025 --> 18:13.626
It's fine. Stay back there.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.796
I've flown in this before.
Everything's cool.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.870
Dad! Dad!

18:24.738 --> 18:26.907
Mayday! Mayday!

18:38.419 --> 18:40.687
Take the knife!
Take the fucking knife, Marq!

18:40.820 --> 18:42.789
Only cut them at the throat.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.098
Veora?

19:57.431 --> 19:58.865
What the fuck...

20:14.949 --> 20:17.784
What the...

20:19.819 --> 20:21.754
Where am I?

20:21.888 --> 20:25.126
Well, well, well, well.

20:25.259 --> 20:27.328
Look at what the cat
done drug in.

20:27.461 --> 20:31.698
Mercy. All right, come on.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.968
Let me get you on
back up on that bed.

20:34.101 --> 20:36.870
What? Where? Where am I?

20:37.004 --> 20:39.974
- Where am I?
- Up in my attic sewing room.

20:40.107 --> 20:43.511
Only suitable room around here
that wasn't already took up.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.013
Now come on,
come on, get on up.

20:46.147 --> 20:49.950
Ma'am, I just want to know how I got
here, where my family is.

20:50.084 --> 20:53.487
Young'un, you been
rode hard and put up wet.

20:53.621 --> 20:56.490
Now you get yourself
up on that bed, all right?

20:56.624 --> 20:59.360
All right? And then we can
talk ourselves a spell.

20:59.493 --> 21:03.030
No, no, see... no, I don't need
to go to nobody's bed.

21:03.164 --> 21:06.200
I just... I need to know
how I got here,

21:06.333 --> 21:09.669
where the hell I am,
where my goddamn family is.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.838
Oh, no. Earl!

21:12.506 --> 21:14.475
- Earl!
- What?

21:14.608 --> 21:19.480
Now if you gonna guest in my attic,
get one thing right from the start.

21:19.613 --> 21:24.385
Vain naming the Lord
in this household? Oh, no!

21:24.518 --> 21:25.619
Earl!

21:26.453 --> 21:29.290
What you hollering
at me for, woman?

21:29.423 --> 21:32.493
You know I got me a bad heart
and a mess of bad innards.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.596
Don't be bad-innarding me.
I got a serious problem up here.

21:35.728 --> 21:39.466
- What, he causing him a ruckus?
- No, mister, I was just asking...

21:39.600 --> 21:42.970
I'll pitch a fit of my own,
he don't get himself back up on that bed.

21:43.103 --> 21:48.175
You do look like you could
eat corn through a picket fence, though.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.180
Yeah, he a big old boy,
too. Mm-hmm.

21:53.314 --> 21:56.250
Too much for me, anyhow.
I'll fetch Lewis up.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.651
Lewis?

21:57.784 --> 22:01.155
No, ma'am. Ma'am...

22:02.122 --> 22:04.225
I just wanna know
where the hell my family is?

22:15.102 --> 22:17.638
Lewis don't talk much.
Some people think he's slow.

22:17.770 --> 22:21.208
But trust me, there ain't
nothing slow about Lewis.

22:22.643 --> 22:24.278
Hey, what's going on, man? Hey!

22:24.411 --> 22:26.580
- Hey! What? Whoa!
- You calm yourself down.

22:26.714 --> 22:28.482
You calm yourself down.

22:28.616 --> 22:31.884
- Damn it. Hey, man!
- He definitely needs to calm himself.

22:32.019 --> 22:35.356
No, I don't need to calm myself. Just need
to know where the fuck my goddamn family is.

22:35.489 --> 22:38.058
- Oh! Lord Jesus.
- Boy, you was in an accident.

22:38.192 --> 22:40.494
- Don't you even remember that?
- Accident...

22:40.628 --> 22:43.030
Mayday!

22:45.065 --> 22:47.201
Now rest yourself
back on that bed.

22:47.334 --> 22:50.371
Oh, my God.
So what about my family?

22:50.504 --> 22:56.677
I got a wife and I got a daughter
and a son. Have you seen my family?

22:56.809 --> 23:00.847
Wasn't no one in that mushed
up old plane but your own self.

23:00.981 --> 23:02.583
Oh, no, no.
No, we gotta get 'em.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.552
- Hey, man!
- You got some of that good rootwork, Ellie?

23:05.686 --> 23:07.588
Earl, you know I do.

23:07.721 --> 23:09.556
And if he can't calm himself,

23:09.690 --> 23:13.860
I'm sure the good Lord will be okay
if I went on and did it for him.

23:13.994 --> 23:16.430
Hell no, I don't need that.
I just need...

23:16.563 --> 23:19.400
What's sauce for the goose
is sauce for the gander.

23:19.533 --> 23:20.968
Oh, no!

24:26.533 --> 24:29.903
I tell you, I'm gonna
cook you up one day.

24:34.308 --> 24:37.177
Ah, you lookin' good,
Marquis T.

25:31.865 --> 25:36.103
Oh!
Long fever-sleep.

25:36.236 --> 25:38.405
Poison in your blood,
I suppose.

25:38.539 --> 25:44.211
Had to put those on you too, 'cause you
was just clawing at your face so bad.

25:44.845 --> 25:48.282
Oh, goodness. Oh, come on.

25:48.415 --> 25:51.051
Must have been
one powerful dream.

25:52.786 --> 25:58.659
- Come on, get up.
- Hey, Ms. Eloise, come on, sit down here for a minute.

25:58.792 --> 26:01.695
Ms. Eloise, I'm begging you.
I just need you to help me.

26:01.829 --> 26:06.333
- Ah.
- What I really think I need is just an ambulance.

26:06.467 --> 26:08.769
Ain't no hospital
within 50 miles of here.

26:08.903 --> 26:13.273
I'm talking about money. I mean it.
I got all the money you could ever want.

26:13.407 --> 26:15.275
- Oh!
- Cost ain't no object.

26:15.409 --> 26:18.111
So, I could pay you gladly for
any ambulance service to come here

26:18.245 --> 26:20.581
from however far, it don't matter
what, whatever it takes,

26:20.714 --> 26:24.117
just so a proper search team can
come back, look for my family.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.954
You understand?
I'm trying to find my family.

26:26.086 --> 26:29.289
And if you could kindly walk
me down them steps of yours,

26:29.423 --> 26:31.391
then I'll use your phone.
I'll use your telephone.

26:31.525 --> 26:33.527
I'll call on my own.
I mean that.

26:33.660 --> 26:38.499
Mercy. You gonna learn,
if you live long as me,

26:38.632 --> 26:41.134
money can't get you everything,

26:41.268 --> 26:43.604
especially a telephone
when you ain't got one.

26:43.737 --> 26:46.540
You're telling me
you ain't got no telephone?

26:46.673 --> 26:49.376
Mm-mm. Supposed to be
bringing people together.

26:49.510 --> 26:56.416
Well, it ain't nothing but just
the tools of the Great Divider. No!

26:57.251 --> 26:59.720
Now I got
a little something here

26:59.853 --> 27:02.456
that'll help you get better.

27:02.589 --> 27:07.094
This is my latest
and greatest Boogity.

27:09.630 --> 27:10.932
What is that?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.768
A Boogity.
You ain't ever heard of a Boogity?

27:16.737 --> 27:20.073
It's one thing
standing for another.

27:20.207 --> 27:23.176
Now this,
it stands for you.

27:23.310 --> 27:25.612
And the more it resembles you,

27:25.746 --> 27:30.717
with blood and nail clippings
and hair, a pinch of semen...

27:33.021 --> 27:35.355
...then, the more it is you.

27:35.489 --> 27:39.760
The more good things
happen to it,

27:40.594 --> 27:44.798
the more good things
happen to you.

27:44.933 --> 27:48.402
Oh, a Boogity's
a kind of folk magic,

27:48.535 --> 27:51.538
like a rootworker, a fixer.

27:51.672 --> 27:56.810
You know how, when people say, "I'm
gonna fix you, I'm gonna fix you good,"

27:56.945 --> 27:58.378
that's what a rootworker do.

27:58.512 --> 28:02.616
Mojos, potions, charms, tricks.

28:02.749 --> 28:09.122
Oh! Son, you looking at
a straight-up, bona fide,

28:09.256 --> 28:12.259
back-in-the-hills
rootworker right here.

28:12.392 --> 28:14.494
Oh, yeah! Let me show you.

28:15.662 --> 28:18.799
I put you up, I put you down.

28:18.933 --> 28:22.569
I put you sideways
and I spin you around.

28:28.241 --> 28:32.145
And then, see, I'm gonna put it over
here, in this here window...

28:33.982 --> 28:35.449
...to look out.

28:38.019 --> 28:41.755
So it can see when help is
gonna come down the road.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.223
Salt.

28:43.357 --> 28:46.360
Yeah!

28:50.764 --> 28:54.068
Marq, the devil can't come
in here and get you neither.

28:56.037 --> 29:02.376
Have a real good rest,
Marquis T. Woods.

29:40.881 --> 29:41.916
Okay...

29:57.999 --> 29:59.299
Let's go.

33:28.276 --> 33:32.445
Yeah! All right! All right!

33:32.579 --> 33:37.184
Who wants a visit from the Ole Hoodoo Ghost?

33:37.318 --> 33:41.488
'Cause I got that good
rootwork that y'all come for,

33:41.621 --> 33:43.823

33:43.958 --> 33:46.793

33:53.267 --> 33:57.204

Who's ailing?

33:57.338 --> 34:00.807
And what about you, Lorraine?
Is you ailing? Come on up here.

34:00.942 --> 34:03.244
- Yeah!
- Come on up here.

34:03.377 --> 34:05.112
Earl, catch that old tomcat.

34:05.246 --> 34:08.548
Take his tongue and put it
in Lorraine's Boogity.

34:08.682 --> 34:10.817
And then save those eyes
for me later.

34:30.104 --> 34:31.805
Ooh!

34:31.939 --> 34:34.275
Speak, woman,
for you are healed!

34:34.408 --> 34:37.411
Speak, woman. Speak up now.
Say them words.

34:37.544 --> 34:41.082
Come on, now. That darn cat
ain't got your tongue no more!

34:41.215 --> 34:43.951
- No dang more!
- I can talk!

34:45.852 --> 34:48.755
See that! She's cured!
Now, we ain't done yet!

34:48.888 --> 34:50.391
Whoo. All right!

34:50.523 --> 34:52.126
Lewis.

34:52.859 --> 34:56.030
Fetch that goat.
Now, Julius, here,

34:56.163 --> 34:59.000
he ain't been able to see
since he had his accident.

34:59.133 --> 35:02.535
Come on.
Come on up here with me.

35:10.478 --> 35:16.050
I need you to take those cat's
eyes and put them into Julius' Boogity.

35:17.717 --> 35:21.122
Now, Julius, if you had eyes,

35:21.255 --> 35:23.257
you'd be able to see.

35:24.358 --> 35:27.761
But you don't have any eyes.
We gonna fix that.

35:27.894 --> 35:30.530
Earl, get those goat's eyes

35:30.663 --> 35:32.599
and bring 'em here to me.

35:35.769 --> 35:38.838
Yes, yes, yes!

35:40.074 --> 35:43.210
Lift your head for me.
That's good, Julius.

35:49.183 --> 35:52.086
You want to see.
You want to see.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.256
Now tell us, Julius,

35:55.389 --> 35:59.193
- tell us what you see.
- What you see, Julius?

36:02.496 --> 36:03.897
What you see?

36:11.671 --> 36:12.907
Him.

36:19.113 --> 36:23.050
Folks, we'll be right back.

36:29.256 --> 36:31.591
I don't think
he could've gotten out.

36:32.426 --> 36:33.928
Let's go see.

36:46.173 --> 36:48.242
Lewis! Come!

38:09.123 --> 38:10.424
The window's open.

38:10.558 --> 38:14.929
Yeah, I needed some air,
Ms. Eloise. That okay?

38:34.081 --> 38:36.917
You soaked plumb through.

38:37.051 --> 38:39.486
You wasn't out
in the rain, were you?

38:41.255 --> 38:42.855
In the rain?

38:42.990 --> 38:45.025
Oh, come on, Eloise,
you kidding?

38:45.159 --> 38:49.630
You know, I just ain't thinking
straight. I'm worried about my family.

39:11.485 --> 39:15.788
Anything special catch your eye
when you moved this curtain?

39:20.427 --> 39:21.629
Like... Like what?

39:21.761 --> 39:23.097
Oh, I don't know.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.333
We were having ourselves
an old time revival

39:26.467 --> 39:29.603
and I just thought you might
have caught yourself an eye-full.

39:31.205 --> 39:34.208
I can't imagine
what a city boy like you

39:34.341 --> 39:36.543
must have thought about that.

39:39.546 --> 39:42.483
By that, you mean, what,
like faith healing? Something like that?

39:42.616 --> 39:46.387
Well, sort of.
Only instead of the Holy Spirit,

39:46.520 --> 39:49.490
we use the Boogity.
Remember what I said?

39:49.623 --> 39:52.792
Come good to the Boogity,
come good to you.

39:53.727 --> 39:57.231
Hmm, like, sticking
chicken legs in a doll

39:57.364 --> 39:59.799
till a paralyzed man
can walk.

40:00.234 --> 40:02.002
Oh...

40:02.136 --> 40:05.639
You just started sounding like them
folks that don't believe nothing

40:05.773 --> 40:07.975
unless they can
see or touch it.

40:08.108 --> 40:11.645
And with all due respect, Ms. Eloise,
you're starting to sound like my father.

40:11.779 --> 40:15.683
Trust me, I've done met my share of
spiritual people in my day, sure have.

40:15.815 --> 40:19.753
All I'm saying is all of that,
I don't know, all of that mojo,

40:19.886 --> 40:22.489
maybe it's just psychosomatic.

40:22.623 --> 40:27.894
Like somebody can believe in something
so bad until it physically becomes true.

40:28.028 --> 40:31.898
I mean, come on, you don't really believe
in all that stuff you been talking, right?

40:37.471 --> 40:39.373
Guess I have to.

40:39.506 --> 40:44.545
We don't have much in the way
of Obamacare around here.

40:48.048 --> 40:50.951
Ms. Eloise,
I didn't mean it like that, okay?

40:51.085 --> 40:53.420
Of course you did.

40:56.290 --> 40:59.026
You a city boy.

41:12.373 --> 41:16.577
Of course. You better
than all of this.

41:27.087 --> 41:30.758
You hear me, boy?
You think you're better than me, boy?

41:30.890 --> 41:33.193
- You just like me, boy.
- No!

41:33.327 --> 41:35.662
- Got that anger in you too. Can't escape it.
- No!

41:35.796 --> 41:38.565
<i>Just like me.
Hey, where you going? Come back here, boy.</i>

41:38.699 --> 41:40.200
<i>You're gonna see!</i>

42:19.206 --> 42:23.043
I see you done worked yourself
up into a sure enough appetite.

42:23.177 --> 42:25.145
Ah, it's so good,
Ms. Eloise.

42:25.279 --> 42:28.482
Hey, look, uh...

42:28.615 --> 42:32.453
I've been meaning
to apologize to you.

42:32.586 --> 42:35.355
Sorry about
what I said yesterday.

42:35.489 --> 42:38.592
I didn't mean it.
I just really miss my family.

42:38.725 --> 42:42.396
- Ah, I know, baby.
- Last time I was up here, it was with my pops,

42:42.529 --> 42:45.999
- and he just wasn't...
- He wasn't one to spare the rod.

42:50.971 --> 42:53.173
I saw those scars on you.

42:58.111 --> 43:02.516
Yeah. Well, let's just say I
done spent the last 25 years...

43:03.750 --> 43:06.587
trying to build a very
different life for myself.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.490
Well, can't never could.

43:09.623 --> 43:13.260
You can't expect
a soul to be able to change

43:13.393 --> 43:15.762
the way he or she thinks,
you know, overnight.

43:15.896 --> 43:21.168
Which is one of the reasons I said
you've gotta keep your strength up.

43:21.301 --> 43:23.637
Let me get you
another helping.

44:12.052 --> 44:17.391
Now I do like
a man with an appetite.

44:17.524 --> 44:20.227
Oh! It means
you're getting stronger.

44:20.360 --> 44:23.096
Well, it sure is good,
Ms. Eloise.

44:23.230 --> 44:25.732
Say, Ms. Eloise,
when I was waking up...

44:27.634 --> 44:31.338
I don't know, it sounded like
I heard like a ping.

44:31.906 --> 44:33.540
And then I heard it again.

44:33.674 --> 44:37.210
Oh, that was probably just
me ringing the chow bell

44:37.344 --> 44:39.179
for Earl and Lewis.

44:39.313 --> 44:41.448
Yeah, but it kinda sounded
like the ping that comes,

44:41.582 --> 44:44.751
you know, when a cellular
phone gets a message.

44:47.754 --> 44:50.223
Ms. Eloise, somebody
could be looking for me.

44:50.357 --> 44:53.928
Oh, well, that would be
a "I do declare" miracle,

44:54.062 --> 44:57.431
seeing how there ain't nothing
like that in this house.

44:57.564 --> 44:59.499
I done already
told you that.

45:01.368 --> 45:04.404
You did tell me that.
You did mention that.

45:05.639 --> 45:08.108
Um, I guess maybe
just a fever dream again.

45:08.241 --> 45:11.378
- What you got going on there?
- Oh, just casting the bones.

45:11.511 --> 45:14.815
You know, you throw them
to tell your future.

45:14.949 --> 45:17.651
- What's it telling you?
- Well, it's telling me

45:17.784 --> 45:20.287
it'll probably be
around the blood moon

45:20.420 --> 45:23.490
when you get
all that poison out of you

45:23.624 --> 45:26.360
and you see your family again.

45:26.493 --> 45:29.030
I can see it right here,
as clear as day.

45:29.162 --> 45:32.833
And that blood moon is only
a couple of days away.

45:32.967 --> 45:34.102
Ooh, come on.

45:34.234 --> 45:37.638
- Try throwing them bones.
- Who, me?

45:37.771 --> 45:39.941
- No, come on. I can't do that.
- Come on.

45:40.074 --> 45:45.178
I know you got that old-time
slave magic in you, Marquis T.

45:49.182 --> 45:51.184
Oh, can you hear that?

45:55.489 --> 45:57.624
That's your ancient self.

45:57.758 --> 46:01.561
Your better self
is calling you.

46:02.262 --> 46:05.766
You know, you like Lewis was.

46:05.899 --> 46:08.069
Uppity house Negro.

46:08.201 --> 46:11.872
- Had to be brought down a peg or two.
- Oh, come on, Ms. Eloise.

46:12.006 --> 46:14.741
Oh, yeah. You like him.
You may live in the city,

46:14.875 --> 46:18.046
but you ain't from there.
You from this land

46:18.178 --> 46:21.314
and everything
that empowers it.

46:21.448 --> 46:24.418
This is the blood
that's running in your veins,

46:24.551 --> 46:26.486
giving you your true life.

46:26.620 --> 46:28.923
Ms. Eloise,
why are you telling me all of this?

46:30.058 --> 46:33.995
'Cause, baby,

46:34.128 --> 46:37.397
you somehow has forgotten,

46:37.531 --> 46:41.868
for a spell, who you are.

46:42.502 --> 46:44.072
Now, what do you see?

46:44.204 --> 46:48.275
All the wisdom of the
universe is in these bones.

46:48.408 --> 46:50.343
Won't you play with them?

46:55.016 --> 46:57.484
Eloise, why do you
keep locking that door, huh?

46:57.617 --> 46:59.653
It's for your own good.

47:00.387 --> 47:02.522
I'm on your side.

47:05.892 --> 47:09.529
What a crock of shit.

47:12.033 --> 47:13.667
Oh, boy.

48:18.865 --> 48:20.001
Help.

48:21.235 --> 48:25.572
Ooh! Oh, can't leave
all this mess

48:25.705 --> 48:28.842
- just laying around.
- Yeah.

48:30.577 --> 48:33.014
- Might stink the whole place up.
- Yeah.

50:43.210 --> 50:47.048
Earl, that you
and that old mangy bird again?

50:48.249 --> 50:51.218
I told you to put that bird
in the root cellar.

50:51.352 --> 50:55.156
Got that old-time magic!
That old-time magic!

50:58.059 --> 51:00.794
Earl? That you?

51:00.928 --> 51:02.196
Shut the fuck up.

51:02.330 --> 51:04.131
You old buzzard?

51:15.409 --> 51:17.510
Shut the fuck up.

51:17.644 --> 51:19.479
I don't know what
Earl's been teaching you.

51:19.612 --> 51:21.848
You old raggedy rat
with wings.

51:21.983 --> 51:24.251
But it's gonna stop,
I tell you that.

51:24.952 --> 51:26.120
Earl!

51:53.381 --> 51:54.514
Earl!

51:54.647 --> 51:56.649
Get Lewis!

54:42.316 --> 54:45.252
Come back here, boy.
What, you some kind of house nigga now?

54:45.386 --> 54:49.023
You're better than me 'cause you
can read your fancy books and all?

54:49.156 --> 54:51.625
It's real,
but you gotta believe.

54:51.758 --> 54:54.662
You're just like me, boy.
You got that anger in you.

54:54.794 --> 54:56.397
You gotta believe
or it won't work.

55:19.386 --> 55:22.323
Ah, the blood moon's tonight.

55:23.691 --> 55:27.061
You're gonna feel
a whole lot better, Eloise.

57:02.756 --> 57:04.224
Fuck!

57:08.562 --> 57:09.930
Okay.

57:23.711 --> 57:24.978
Veora?

57:33.821 --> 57:35.255
Tydon?

58:50.330 --> 58:52.166
That old-time magic.

59:04.178 --> 59:07.080
Veora? Sam? Ty?

59:47.221 --> 59:50.224
Why are you doing
all this, Eloise?

1:00:04.238 --> 1:00:06.073
Eloise.

1:00:06.807 --> 1:00:08.542
Earl.

1:00:09.576 --> 1:00:10.611
Lewis.

1:00:10.744 --> 1:00:14.147
"1860." What the fuck?

1:00:20.287 --> 1:00:24.191
What are you up to,
you old crazy lady?

1:00:25.292 --> 1:00:28.795
"Blood moon.
Transference of life spell."

1:00:32.032 --> 1:00:33.800
"Blood of my blood."

1:00:33.935 --> 1:00:35.402
Blood of my blood.

1:00:35.536 --> 1:00:37.504
"Seed of my seed."

1:00:38.572 --> 1:00:40.641
"Flesh of my flesh."

1:00:44.778 --> 1:00:48.382
Oh, my God.
They're putting a spell on me.

1:00:58.392 --> 1:01:00.527
<i>Gotta believe
or it won't work.</i>

1:02:10.897 --> 1:02:13.166
Come on, come on...

1:02:14.234 --> 1:02:15.469
Yeah.

1:02:21.109 --> 1:02:22.509
I fucking knew it.

1:02:23.343 --> 1:02:25.278
Ah, shit!

1:02:25.412 --> 1:02:28.482
Fuck, come on, come on.

1:02:28.615 --> 1:02:31.385
If I had known that
Lorraine was gonna talk so much,

1:02:31.518 --> 1:02:33.720
I'd have never put a tongue
back in her mouth.

1:02:33.854 --> 1:02:36.857
That woman can talk now.

1:02:36.991 --> 1:02:38.926
Ty's phone. Yes.

1:02:39.726 --> 1:02:41.795
All right...

1:02:43.397 --> 1:02:46.466
With all that cussin' you do,
I'm gonna sew it up.

1:02:52.006 --> 1:02:54.174
Whoa...

1:02:55.308 --> 1:02:57.411
Marquis T.,
you awake up there?

1:02:57.544 --> 1:03:00.514
About time to get
your dressings changed.

1:03:00.647 --> 1:03:04.052
Darn it, Ellie, did you
leave the door ajar again?

1:03:04.184 --> 1:03:08.455
No. Sounds like something
your old barren ass would do.

1:03:08.588 --> 1:03:11.092
What if he ripped
that spike out?

1:03:11.224 --> 1:03:13.794
Been free-wheelin' all over
the farm while we was gone.

1:03:13.928 --> 1:03:16.196
Well,
we fixin' to find out, ain't we?

1:03:16.329 --> 1:03:17.932
Lewis, bring that ax.

1:03:18.066 --> 1:03:20.801
Might gonna have
to chop at something else.

1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:08.482
Oh, fuck.

1:04:38.212 --> 1:04:43.416
Marquis T., you haven't
been walking around here, have you?

1:04:43.550 --> 1:04:46.553
Oh, Ms. Eloise, no, no, no.

1:04:46.686 --> 1:04:49.389
- I just woke up.
- Uh-huh.

1:04:49.523 --> 1:04:52.459
Well, we gonna have to
look at that foot of yours.

1:04:53.995 --> 1:04:57.464
- Okay.
- There, there.

1:05:03.403 --> 1:05:05.940
- Well...
- Yeah, it's looking better there, right?

1:05:06.673 --> 1:05:08.308
That's what them bones said.

1:05:08.441 --> 1:05:10.044
It'd be time
by the blood moon.

1:05:10.178 --> 1:05:13.680
Which is a total lunar eclipse,
ain't that right, Mr. Earl?

1:05:13.814 --> 1:05:17.018
Yeah, if my memory serves
me correct, that's tonight.

1:05:17.151 --> 1:05:18.552
Hmm, well!

1:05:18.685 --> 1:05:22.924
It looks a mite refreshed.

1:05:23.057 --> 1:05:24.791
Oh, ah, yes, it does.

1:05:24.926 --> 1:05:26.493
- Yeah.
- I'll grant you that.

1:05:26.626 --> 1:05:28.262
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

1:05:28.395 --> 1:05:30.031
Well, you get your rest,

1:05:30.164 --> 1:05:34.068
since you're so close
to all of this being over.

1:05:42.676 --> 1:05:44.411
Go on, Lewis.

1:05:52.485 --> 1:05:54.021
Oh, come on, come on.

1:05:57.158 --> 1:05:58.491
Oh, come on...

1:05:59.559 --> 1:06:02.495
Come on, son.
What's your passcode?

1:06:02.629 --> 1:06:07.034
Birthday... 2-1-6.

1:06:07.168 --> 1:06:08.401
Damn it.

1:06:12.439 --> 1:06:13.975
Fuck.

1:06:14.108 --> 1:06:16.177
You're a 16-year-old boy,

1:06:16.310 --> 1:06:17.912
what could your passcode be?

1:06:21.115 --> 1:06:22.649
What would it be?

1:06:28.990 --> 1:06:31.458
Ah! Yeah!

1:06:33.426 --> 1:06:35.930
Yeah. Hello?

1:06:36.063 --> 1:06:38.199
<i>Cypress Valley
Police Department.</i>

1:06:38.332 --> 1:06:41.468
Listen, I've got 1% battery
left on this phone, okay?

1:06:41.601 --> 1:06:44.704
- So I gotta talk real fast.
- <i>Okay, now slow up, tell me what the heck's going on.</i>

1:06:44.838 --> 1:06:47.909
We went down in a plane crash, all right?
Next thing I know, I wake up in this house

1:06:48.042 --> 1:06:51.544
- I can't tell you where it is.
- <i>Hold up, you wouldn't happen to be Marquis T. Woods?</i>

1:06:51.678 --> 1:06:53.147
Yeah, yeah. That's me.
Do you know me?

1:06:53.281 --> 1:06:55.649
<i>Know you?
Mr. Woods, we spoke.</i>

1:06:55.782 --> 1:06:58.219
<i>I checked in on you at
the gas station in Lemona.</i>

1:06:58.352 --> 1:07:02.455
- Yeah, I remember you. Yeah!
- <i>I've been looking for you all week.</i>

1:07:02.589 --> 1:07:05.960
<i>Your wife and daughter walked into the
police station about five days ago,</i>

1:07:06.093 --> 1:07:08.162
- <i>battered and bruised.</i>
- What about my son?

1:07:08.296 --> 1:07:10.463
- <i>Oh...</i>
- What was that?

1:07:10.597 --> 1:07:13.334
<i>Mr. Woods, I'm sorry, um,</i>

1:07:13.466 --> 1:07:16.569
<i>we have not found
your son yet.</i>

1:07:22.109 --> 1:07:23.677
<i>Mr. Woods?</i>

1:07:23.810 --> 1:07:26.479
<i>Mr. Woods, listen, I'm sorry.</i>

1:07:26.613 --> 1:07:30.351
<i>Why don't you tell me where you are,
and I can come get you, at least.</i>

1:07:30.483 --> 1:07:34.422
Somewhere, in a house,
with these old goddamn people.

1:07:34.554 --> 1:07:35.990
They're black,
I can tell you that.

1:07:36.123 --> 1:07:38.326
Um, the woman is Eloise,
they call her Ellie.

1:07:38.458 --> 1:07:41.695
I think her husband...
her husband, his name is Earl.

1:07:41.828 --> 1:07:44.165
<i>I do know an old couple
who go by those names.</i>

1:07:44.298 --> 1:07:46.300
<i>I'm right by
that farm right now.</i>

1:07:46.434 --> 1:07:49.903
<i>I'll come in.
Now, you stay by that phone, you hear?</i>

1:08:14.828 --> 1:08:16.496
That's it, that's it.

1:08:41.155 --> 1:08:42.189
Fuck.

1:08:43.290 --> 1:08:47.061
You got a big
mouth, don't you?

1:08:56.803 --> 1:08:59.106
See and feel that?

1:09:13.686 --> 1:09:15.990
Hey, Sheriff.

1:09:50.857 --> 1:09:53.527
<i>Hello? Mr. Woods?</i>

1:09:54.462 --> 1:09:57.364
<i>Mr. Woods?</i>

1:09:57.498 --> 1:09:58.999
<i>Mr. Woods, you there?</i>

1:10:48.349 --> 1:10:51.085
Earl, get Lewis.

1:10:53.686 --> 1:10:55.655
Get Lewis!

1:11:12.705 --> 1:11:15.675
What the hell?
What you doing?

1:11:17.111 --> 1:11:18.412
You okay?

1:11:20.948 --> 1:11:22.849
What the hell's going on?

1:11:23.384 --> 1:11:24.817
What... What?

1:11:32.493 --> 1:11:33.893
What you doing?

1:11:37.031 --> 1:11:39.300
- Are you gonna tell me...
- Just drive. Sheriff, okay?

1:11:39.433 --> 1:11:40.467
All right, I'm driving.

1:11:41.635 --> 1:11:44.305
I'm driving. Now you gonna tell
me what the hell's going on?

1:11:44.438 --> 1:11:46.407
I don't know. If I knew,
I would tell you.

1:11:46.540 --> 1:11:49.143
- All I know is they were keeping me prisoner.
- Prisoner?

1:11:49.276 --> 1:11:52.346
- Prisoner! Eloise and Earl!
- Eloise and Earl? It can't be.

1:11:52.479 --> 1:11:55.683
- They're just the sweetest old couple.
- They're evil. I'm telling you.

1:11:55.815 --> 1:11:58.586
Evil conjurers, rootworkers,
backwoods fixers.

1:11:58.718 --> 1:12:01.255
And they ain't the only ones in on it.
They got big-ass Lewis in on it.

1:12:01.388 --> 1:12:05.559
They got a whole cult of these assholes up
here. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1:12:05.693 --> 1:12:08.696
- A cult. Controlling people.
- Controlling people?

1:12:08.828 --> 1:12:12.032
It's just that, at the head of the
table, is crazy-ass Eloise.

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:14.401
And she's controlling
every single one of them.

1:12:14.535 --> 1:12:17.471
The freakiest-ass,
Afro-Appalachian cult you done ever seen.

1:12:17.605 --> 1:12:21.041
Well, now hold up there, fella.
I might not be too in-step with the times,

1:12:21.175 --> 1:12:24.011
but that sounds
downright racist to me.

1:12:28.616 --> 1:12:31.252
What? Where are you...

1:12:37.258 --> 1:12:41.595
You and your bougie,
pretty-ass wife just wouldn't listen to me.

1:12:41.729 --> 1:12:43.863
Go on. Get.

1:12:44.465 --> 1:12:45.399
Fuck you, man.

1:12:45.532 --> 1:12:48.202
Fuck you. Fuck you!

1:12:48.868 --> 1:12:50.170
Fuck you!

1:12:52.439 --> 1:12:57.244
Haul that uppity-ass
city nigga into the barn.

1:12:58.878 --> 1:13:00.648
Thank you, Sheriff Pines.

1:13:00.780 --> 1:13:04.451
If you've had your fun, I think
we can take it from here.

1:13:04.585 --> 1:13:06.987
That rootwork is starting
to wear a bit thin.

1:13:07.121 --> 1:13:10.524
- I'd see to it, I was you.
- Now don't you worry, Tom.

1:13:10.658 --> 1:13:12.192
I surely will.

1:13:12.326 --> 1:13:15.429
We gonna have us
a special power night tonight.

1:13:15.562 --> 1:13:19.366
Oh, yeah. Everybody's
gonna get a little piece of this.

1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:23.103
Lewis, go rustle up them folks
at the McFarland farm.

1:13:23.237 --> 1:13:25.838
Tell them the blood moon is up.

1:13:36.984 --> 1:13:38.752
Ah! Veora!

1:13:38.885 --> 1:13:40.887
Veora! Sam!

1:13:41.021 --> 1:13:43.890
Ty! Hey, hey, it's Dad!

1:13:44.024 --> 1:13:46.960
They're not gonna hear you.

1:13:48.162 --> 1:13:51.165
I done told you,
you gotta reap what you sow.

1:13:59.673 --> 1:14:01.742
Bring me...

1:14:01.874 --> 1:14:03.110
that big one up here.

1:14:03.243 --> 1:14:05.079
Fetch him up
onto this here table.

1:14:10.684 --> 1:14:11.851
Yes!

1:14:16.156 --> 1:14:20.127
You think you're better
than everybody else that's here,

1:14:20.260 --> 1:14:22.596
Mr. "Gotta See It,
Gotta Feel It."

1:14:22.730 --> 1:14:27.267
Now, the only thing that
might be better about you

1:14:27.401 --> 1:14:29.869
than all these people
right here,

1:14:30.003 --> 1:14:33.073
- is this heart...
- Yeah!

1:14:33.207 --> 1:14:35.609
...beating right here
in your chest!

1:14:35.743 --> 1:14:36.944
Yeah!

1:14:37.077 --> 1:14:39.313
And in about
the next ten seconds,

1:14:39.446 --> 1:14:41.582
you ain't gonna
even have that!

1:14:44.884 --> 1:14:46.587
Come on, Ellie.
Bring it on home.

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:49.857
Oh, Earl, now you think
you're ready for all this?

1:14:49.990 --> 1:14:51.225
I'm ready, bring it home.

1:14:51.358 --> 1:14:52.693
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

1:14:52.826 --> 1:14:57.398
You ready?
All right, then. Uh-huh.

1:15:02.803 --> 1:15:05.372
Get Lewis! Get Lewis!

1:15:14.448 --> 1:15:17.284
Pick it up, and push it down.

1:15:19.319 --> 1:15:21.755
Then push the bad stuff

1:15:21.889 --> 1:15:23.657
in the good bottle.

1:15:24.291 --> 1:15:26.460
And the crazy old witch...

1:15:51.285 --> 1:15:54.621
All right, let me see you.
Sam, let me see you.

1:15:54.755 --> 1:15:56.957
All right? Okay.

1:15:57.090 --> 1:15:59.526
And my boy, you good?

1:15:59.660 --> 1:16:00.961
Yeah, I'm good.

1:16:14.208 --> 1:16:16.009
Follow me.

1:16:16.143 --> 1:16:18.278
Where are we going? Marq!

1:16:18.412 --> 1:16:21.615
Okay, Sam, Ty, find whatever you
can, put it in front of the door,

1:16:21.748 --> 1:16:23.183
so they think
we're barricading in.

1:16:23.317 --> 1:16:24.818
- Come on, come on.
- Okay.

1:16:24.953 --> 1:16:26.887
I need you all to get out.
Follow the river.

1:16:27.020 --> 1:16:29.990
I found us a car,
get us out of here. Hey.

1:16:31.625 --> 1:16:32.893
I'm sorry.

1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:35.262
You're all safe now.

1:16:35.395 --> 1:16:37.331
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1:16:57.919 --> 1:17:00.754
Jesus. Fuck.

1:17:14.701 --> 1:17:16.503
I tried to warn you.

1:17:17.804 --> 1:17:20.975
Why don't you come out
and show yourself, boy?

1:17:21.108 --> 1:17:23.577
Huh?

1:17:23.710 --> 1:17:26.680
You want some?
Come on and get it.

1:17:27.949 --> 1:17:29.316
Come on!

1:17:29.816 --> 1:17:31.051
Come on, boy!

1:17:32.886 --> 1:17:34.087
Where you at, boy?

1:17:38.058 --> 1:17:39.526
Where you at, boy?

1:18:15.762 --> 1:18:20.367
Come on! Come on!
Get him, get him!

1:18:20.500 --> 1:18:23.303
Go get him! Go get him!

1:18:23.437 --> 1:18:26.273
Go. You get him.
You get him, Lewis!

1:18:28.175 --> 1:18:30.344
You stay there!

1:18:30.912 --> 1:18:32.179
You get him!

1:19:13.153 --> 1:19:14.688
Lewis?

1:19:46.820 --> 1:19:48.122
Clever.

1:19:48.255 --> 1:19:54.461
Very clever, Mr. "Gotta See
It, Gotta Feel It."

1:19:56.830 --> 1:20:00.200
I guess that's why
I hide my Boogity,

1:20:00.333 --> 1:20:02.170
where no one can mess with it.

1:20:15.482 --> 1:20:17.484
Now, you see that, Ms. Ellie?

1:20:19.519 --> 1:20:21.521
That's why I made my own.

1:20:48.782 --> 1:20:50.417
Is that it?

1:20:53.487 --> 1:20:57.257
You're just gonna let
an old lady burn?

1:21:06.533 --> 1:21:08.568
You taught me a lot, Ms. Ellie.

1:21:09.103 --> 1:21:10.904
And so did my pops.

1:21:42.335 --> 1:21:45.472
If it can keep the devil out,
it sure as hell ought to keep you in.

1:21:46.007 --> 1:21:49.243
No! No!

1:21:59.419 --> 1:22:02.622
If you people get back,
I don't have to use these Boogitys.

1:22:04.891 --> 1:22:08.895
Everybody get back.
Let him through.

1:22:10.330 --> 1:22:11.731
Let him through.

1:24:17.857 --> 1:24:20.660
<i>I put you up, I put you down.</i>

1:24:20.794 --> 1:24:23.965
<i>I put you sideways
and I spin you around.</i>
