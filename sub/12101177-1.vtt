WEBVTT

00:00.897 --> 00:03.147
(whirring)

00:07.163 --> 00:09.330
(barking)

00:43.320 --> 00:44.400
- Cherry Jubilee.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.390
- Thanks.

00:45.390 --> 00:46.300
You didn't want one?

00:46.300 --> 00:48.200
- Trying to watch my figure.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.033
- Shut up.

00:54.770 --> 00:58.220
You ever just wanna sail away some days

00:58.220 --> 00:59.653
and never look back?

01:00.760 --> 01:02.003
- I'm happy where I am.

01:04.215 --> 01:07.090
Besides I did enough
traveling when I was younger.

01:07.090 --> 01:09.140
Six different schools before junior high.

01:10.289 --> 01:13.070
My parents never knew how to keep a job.

01:13.070 --> 01:13.903
How about you?

01:14.814 --> 01:15.647
(sighs)

01:15.647 --> 01:17.370
- I've been pretty spoiled.

01:17.370 --> 01:21.843
Mom's lawyer, dad's doctor,
wealthy friends, good schools.

01:23.070 --> 01:24.080
Do you ever wonder

01:24.080 --> 01:26.230
if there's anything
else for you out there?

01:27.280 --> 01:30.043
- Not really, to be honest.

01:31.030 --> 01:34.093
Most days I'm grateful just to
go to bed on a full stomach.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.569
- I had no idea.

01:36.569 --> 01:37.853
And you still bought me ice cream?

01:39.120 --> 01:39.953
Well here.

01:39.953 --> 01:41.690
I know it's our first date

01:41.690 --> 01:42.870
but I do wanna see you again.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.039
Let me reimburse you for dinner.

01:45.039 --> 01:46.430
- Thank you Stella that's not necessary.

01:46.430 --> 01:48.100
I really appreciate the gesture though.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.639
- No, it's fine.

01:49.639 --> 01:51.180
(sighs)

01:51.180 --> 01:53.030
I have more money than
I know what to do with.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.618
Besides if you're gonna be with me

01:54.618 --> 01:55.451
you shouldn't have to worry

01:55.451 --> 01:56.683
about paying for an ice cream cone.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.933
(slugging)

02:07.749 --> 02:10.940
- [Voiceover] When you got
nothing to give this world

02:10.940 --> 02:15.540
and the world does nothing
but spit in your face.

02:15.540 --> 02:19.450
Sometimes the only thing
you can do is balance it

02:19.450 --> 02:22.220
for the greater good (laughs)

02:23.990 --> 02:25.973
That's the only thing that's left.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.363
Don't judge me.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.923
I don't like killing, but it
makes the world go around.

02:35.230 --> 02:39.403
Everyone hates the snake that
eats the cute little mouse,

02:40.260 --> 02:44.343
but wouldn't you rather be a snake?

02:45.519 --> 02:47.795
(screaming)

02:47.795 --> 02:50.795
(upbeat funk music)

04:00.740 --> 04:03.100
- Hey buddy, you need some help?

04:03.100 --> 04:06.920
- Yeah, actually could you
tight me off on that end there?

04:06.920 --> 04:09.591
- Yeah, no problem. It's a good idea

04:09.591 --> 04:10.720
- Thanks.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.770
- It's a big boat right here, huh?

04:12.770 --> 04:13.730
Serious.

04:13.730 --> 04:16.399
- She sure is, she a beauty.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.233
- She really is.

04:18.116 --> 04:20.366
(groaning)

04:23.097 --> 04:25.180
(coughs)

04:34.054 --> 04:36.221
(panting)

04:48.465 --> 04:51.132
(ominous music)

05:07.925 --> 05:08.758
- C'mon we're gonna be late.

05:08.758 --> 05:10.670
I told Elle and Emma one 30 sharp.

05:10.670 --> 05:11.780
- Why don't you just go without me?

05:11.780 --> 05:12.830
I'll catch up with you later.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.810
I'm not even halfway
done with my work here.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.270
- I'll drive. Just study in the car.

05:16.270 --> 05:18.720
- I can't just study in the car Eve.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.300
- Why not? I do it all the time.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.880
- Not the same. Your dad let's you coast.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.668
- Your dad's just as successful Gracie.

05:24.668 --> 05:26.830
- But he's not a hard ass like mine

05:26.830 --> 05:30.360
and demands a 4.1 GPA every semester.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.720
- You know they still
have a bug up their ass

05:31.720 --> 05:32.553
about this trip.

05:32.553 --> 05:34.300
You're not getting off the hook that easy.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.380
- I'm not trying to get out of anything.

05:36.380 --> 05:38.700
After this final I'll drink

05:38.700 --> 05:40.460
all three of you under the table.

05:40.460 --> 05:41.950
But until then I have to study.

05:41.950 --> 05:45.003
- Okay rock star. I'll
see you tomorrow then.

05:47.526 --> 05:49.649
(mumbles)

05:49.649 --> 05:51.570
- Hey.

05:51.570 --> 05:52.523
- Hey.

05:53.932 --> 05:56.550
- Where the hell is Grace?

05:56.550 --> 05:59.420
What a bitch. I knew she was
gonna try to pull this shit.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.450
- She said you'd say that.

06:00.450 --> 06:02.867
- Oh my god. We were
supposed to be on a beach

06:02.867 --> 06:06.405
like fucking yesterday getting
plastered on painkillers.

06:06.405 --> 06:07.710
- Chill babe.

06:07.710 --> 06:09.090
- She's got a final to study for

06:09.090 --> 06:11.056
in Sullivan's class tomorrow.

06:11.056 --> 06:12.302
- So what?

06:12.302 --> 06:13.750
- So some of us actually
study for them Chaz.

06:13.750 --> 06:14.830
- Who's gonna get the booze?

06:14.830 --> 06:16.790
- I'll get the booze relax.

06:16.790 --> 06:18.110
Her dad's all psycho about it.

06:18.110 --> 06:19.286
She's lucky he even
agreed to letting her go

06:19.286 --> 06:20.851
in the first place.

06:20.851 --> 06:21.684
(sighs)

06:21.684 --> 06:23.260
- But Grace was supposed to get the booze.

06:23.260 --> 06:24.630
- I'll get the booze.

06:24.630 --> 06:27.890
- Tables ready

06:27.890 --> 06:29.982
- Let's get some fuckin' sushi.

06:29.982 --> 06:31.861
(vocalizes)

06:31.861 --> 06:33.269
(laughs)

06:33.269 --> 06:34.102
- That picture?

06:34.102 --> 06:36.019
- I took a fucking pic.

06:37.103 --> 06:38.663
- Where'd you find this one?

06:40.824 --> 06:42.260
(door slams)

06:42.260 --> 06:43.590
- Dog park?

06:43.590 --> 06:44.940
- We don't even have a dog.

06:45.860 --> 06:46.810
- I don't need one.

06:48.090 --> 06:49.700
- Where do you want me to dump her?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.420
- Take her back to the ship.

06:51.420 --> 06:53.120
Dad and Maggie said they
want to see all the bodies

06:53.120 --> 06:53.970
from here on out.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.433
- They're not happy with pictures anymore?

06:58.612 --> 07:01.723
- Let them have their trophies.

07:09.540 --> 07:11.600
- What time you think
you'll be back tonight?

07:11.600 --> 07:14.843
- I don't know need to do
shopping for a new suit.

07:22.257 --> 07:24.490
(chiming)

07:24.490 --> 07:25.710
- This is bullshit.

07:25.710 --> 07:26.760
Why does grace always thinks

07:26.760 --> 07:28.718
she can pull this kind of shit?

07:28.718 --> 07:30.380
(sighs)

07:30.380 --> 07:31.213
- Give it a rest Em.

07:31.213 --> 07:32.046
What do you think of this one?

07:32.046 --> 07:33.175
(laughs)

07:33.175 --> 07:36.043
- Girl, just what the fuck are you putting

07:36.043 --> 07:37.983
in your crack crack pipe these days?

07:38.899 --> 07:41.619
You're in no shape to pull that off.

07:41.619 --> 07:44.432
- What the fuck. A bit odd I can afford.

07:44.432 --> 07:47.522
It's sad we don't have
rich daddys like them.

07:47.522 --> 07:49.000
I don't wanna look like a homeless person

07:49.000 --> 07:49.832
while they're walking around

07:49.832 --> 07:51.650
in their designer two piece.

07:51.650 --> 07:54.020
- What? Like they're
gonna steal dick from us?

07:54.020 --> 07:55.681
You're hilarious.

07:55.681 --> 07:56.900
(chuckles)

07:56.900 --> 07:59.530
Gracie will show her thesis
to the first boy she sees

07:59.530 --> 08:01.389
and we'll all be cork blocked

08:01.389 --> 08:03.370
before we can even step
foot out of the hotel.

08:03.370 --> 08:07.163
- I hate everything in this
store. It is disgusting.

08:16.419 --> 08:18.669
(chuckles)

08:20.300 --> 08:21.200
- Hello.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.530
- Hello.

08:22.530 --> 08:24.170
- My name is Kirk.

08:24.170 --> 08:28.483
I overheard you talking,
with your friend in there.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.193
Are you planning a trip to Cabo?

08:32.970 --> 08:34.200
- Yes.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.203
Just a few of us girls.

08:37.510 --> 08:38.610
- What's the occasion.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.840
- Just a little vacay.

08:42.840 --> 08:46.830
We just launched a tech startup. Why?

08:46.830 --> 08:51.680
- Reason I ask is my
family owns a cruise ship

08:51.680 --> 08:53.080
and we were planning on taking a trip

08:53.080 --> 08:55.528
down that way anyway in a couple of days.

08:55.528 --> 08:56.891
(chuckles)

08:56.891 --> 08:59.203
It would be nice to have some company

08:59.203 --> 09:02.140
- Shut up. You do not own a cruise ship.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.543
- We take a trip to Mexico every year.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.150
Even have our own special route.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.283
Beautiful sunsets.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.383
We call it Venom Coast.

09:15.180 --> 09:19.760
- Well, Kirk it's very sweet

09:19.760 --> 09:21.450
but we are a pretty big group

09:21.450 --> 09:24.486
and we've already purchased
all of our plane fare.

09:24.486 --> 09:27.193
- Hey, no pressure.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.753
And we got plenty of room
if you change your mind.

09:32.723 --> 09:34.973
(chuckles)

09:41.100 --> 09:41.933
- Kirk.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.900
Say we change our mind.

09:47.410 --> 09:48.810
How do we get a hold of you?

09:50.286 --> 09:51.253
- Give me your phone?

09:53.694 --> 09:56.111
(screeching)

10:04.350 --> 10:05.350
Let me know.

10:16.580 --> 10:17.880
- That's ridiculous Elle.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.947
Come on.

10:18.947 --> 10:21.020
Think about it. I already talked to Emma.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.420
She's totally on board.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.300
I mean think about it.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.200
We could be on top of a ship

10:25.200 --> 10:28.790
all the way to Cabo getting
tan, drinking cocktails,

10:28.790 --> 10:31.860
we get to save on plane
fare and hotel fare.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.610
- We don't even know this dude.

10:33.610 --> 10:35.750
- It's not like he's a
serial killer or anything.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.050
Plus the boys are here.

10:37.050 --> 10:39.670
If he tries anything,
they will protect us.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.853
- And you guys are okay with this?

10:43.980 --> 10:44.970
- Yeah.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.680
- I still don't wanna do it.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.980
- Do you know where I was today?

10:48.980 --> 10:52.590
I went shopping at the
Salvation fucking Army.

10:52.590 --> 10:54.160
And I need your help.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.093
We need to save some money please.

10:58.027 --> 11:01.193
- Okay I guess if everyone
else is okay with it.

11:01.193 --> 11:04.011
- I'm gonna text him.
I'm gonna text the guy.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.203
Oh my god it's gonna be (cheers)

11:06.203 --> 11:08.383
It's gonna be great.

11:08.383 --> 11:13.383
Emma would totally eat
those guys ass so would I.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.633
- Hey babe.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.040
- You guys couldn't
have consulted me first

11:20.040 --> 11:21.540
before you made this decision?

11:22.920 --> 11:25.170
I don't need this shit right now.

11:25.170 --> 11:26.650
My finals in less than 12 hours.

11:26.650 --> 11:29.213
And I haven't even cracked
open the second book yet.

11:30.410 --> 11:31.593
No, I didn't know that.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.360
Well, if it's such a big deal

11:34.360 --> 11:35.960
I could have paid for Elle and Emma.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.246
- [Eve] That's not the point Grace.

11:38.246 --> 11:39.743
You're acting like a spoiled bitch.

11:39.743 --> 11:41.318
- [Eve] We need to think
more about Emma and Elle

11:41.318 --> 11:43.699
and be a little more sensitive
around them with this stuff.

11:43.699 --> 11:44.899
Just let them have this.

11:45.930 --> 11:47.077
Grace? Grace?

12:07.496 --> 12:09.496
(slams)

12:12.436 --> 12:14.686
(burbling)

12:26.071 --> 12:28.738
(ominous music)

12:46.359 --> 12:50.116
(breathing heavily)

12:50.116 --> 12:52.366
(burbling)

13:52.628 --> 13:55.461
(phone vibrating)

14:19.190 --> 14:20.943
- You have to call me now?

14:21.900 --> 14:23.983
- [Kirk] You're at that
girl's house, aren't you?

14:24.879 --> 14:27.920
You followed her home, didn't you?

14:27.920 --> 14:30.270
- I wanted this one for myself.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.860
- [Kirk] You can have her on this ship.

14:32.860 --> 14:36.103
You blow it now we lose the whole group.

14:51.957 --> 14:54.540
- Leif's on his way back right now.

14:54.540 --> 14:55.373
- Good.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.430
- He almost jeopardized everything.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.233
You need to talk to him tonight.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.800
- We need to talk to him Kirk.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.255
This family hides no secrets.

15:06.255 --> 15:07.163
- Yes ma'am.

15:09.253 --> 15:12.003
(phone vibrates)

15:15.210 --> 15:17.300
I just got a text from one of the girls

15:17.300 --> 15:18.960
they'll be arriving at noon tomorrow.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.853
All four of 'em and two boys.

15:23.890 --> 15:27.490
Maybe with this group we
can work out a ransom.

15:27.490 --> 15:28.750
It will benefit our situation.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.850
- We do not target rich people

15:30.850 --> 15:32.803
for their money Kirk you know that.

15:32.803 --> 15:34.690
- I know, but wouldn't it be--

15:34.690 --> 15:38.090
- I will not even further
dignify this conversation

15:38.090 --> 15:39.560
with a response.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.363
We are not thieves.

15:45.566 --> 15:47.080
- I understand.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.483
- Good. Now help me clean up your father.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.107
I have to feed Jesse and
change his dressings.

17:00.407 --> 17:02.824
(door slams)

17:08.435 --> 17:09.356
- Is this it?

17:09.356 --> 17:10.980
- Could use some paint.

17:10.980 --> 17:13.380
- It's probably nicer inside.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.440
Plus, we're gonna get shit-faced

17:14.440 --> 17:17.170
and trash the place anyway. So who cares?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.150
- Looks like the home of a serial killer.

17:19.150 --> 17:20.900
- You know Eve? I hope it is.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.467
It'll put us all out of our misery.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.412
- [Elle] Little help over here.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.662
(whooping)

17:32.574 --> 17:35.157
- You wanna check out the boat?

17:36.610 --> 17:39.040
We're so gonna have a good time.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.130
- I just lost cell reception.

17:41.130 --> 17:42.350
Are you getting anything down here?

17:42.350 --> 17:43.720
- I know it's not up to your standards.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.685
It's not up to mine either.

17:45.685 --> 17:47.460
Look, your finals are over.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.950
We have nothing to do

17:48.950 --> 17:51.990
but drink and lay out in
the sun for two weeks.

17:51.990 --> 17:53.627
So save your tears.

17:53.627 --> 17:55.323
- Remember what you told me?

17:57.519 --> 17:59.370
(fizzes)

17:59.370 --> 18:00.203
(gasps)

18:00.203 --> 18:02.286
(cheers)

18:07.134 --> 18:10.551
- Pregame has officially started bitches.

18:13.553 --> 18:14.626
- I feel better now.

18:14.626 --> 18:15.459
(chuckles)

18:15.459 --> 18:17.193
- Good. Now let's get
our shit on the boat.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.442
- Do they live on this ship or something?

18:27.442 --> 18:30.580
(birds chirping)

18:30.580 --> 18:32.060
- Is there anyone else coming?

18:32.060 --> 18:33.023
- I don't know.

18:33.860 --> 18:36.290
Why didn't you ask him yourself Elle?

18:36.290 --> 18:37.510
- You made it.

18:37.510 --> 18:38.343
Gang's all here.

18:38.343 --> 18:40.970
- Hi Kirk, let me go around the horn.

18:40.970 --> 18:44.800
This is Elle, Eve, Grace, Perry, and Chaz.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.633
There'll be a quiz later.

18:45.633 --> 18:47.412
So I hope you got all of that.

18:47.412 --> 18:48.577
- I got it. I think.

18:48.577 --> 18:51.630
Can I help anyone with their bags?

18:51.630 --> 18:52.733
- Yeah, right over here.

18:55.850 --> 18:57.733
- Hey, so when did you get this bad boy?

18:58.640 --> 19:01.097
- It's been in my family for years.

19:01.097 --> 19:04.690
- How many crew members you
need for a ship like this.

19:04.690 --> 19:07.020
- Not many. It's a few family members.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.769
I'll introduce you to them tonight.

19:08.769 --> 19:10.355
- All right.

19:10.355 --> 19:13.188
(wheels rumbling)

19:17.250 --> 19:18.920
- I'm not getting any
reception out here either.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.460
Did you tell your dad where we're going?

19:20.460 --> 19:23.270
- Yeah. I gave him the address
and the route we're taking.

19:23.270 --> 19:25.720
- Couldn't find any Venom
Coast on Google though.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.566
(sighs)

19:27.566 --> 19:29.710
I'll just call him as
soon as I get signal back.

19:33.210 --> 19:35.793
(crows cawing)

19:37.276 --> 19:40.026
(birds chirping)

19:42.790 --> 19:44.267
- All right guys.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.702
(laughing)

19:46.702 --> 19:48.685
Go ahead look around.

19:48.685 --> 19:51.600
just make sure to stay
off the lower levels.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.500
We'll take off in about an hour or so.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.053
Make yourselves at home.

19:57.053 --> 19:59.303
(laughing)

20:04.342 --> 20:06.509
(fizzing)

20:08.920 --> 20:09.753
- Chug.

20:11.372 --> 20:14.705
(cheering and laughing)

20:28.500 --> 20:30.430
- I guess one room is
as good as any other.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.082
Wanna be roomies?

20:32.082 --> 20:33.499
- It's all right.

20:37.290 --> 20:39.740
- This place smells like
my grandma's old closet.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.570
- No you don't. Vacation starts now.

20:45.570 --> 20:47.107
- Hey I wanted to thank your dad.

20:47.107 --> 20:48.070
- For what?

20:48.070 --> 20:49.490
- For everything.

20:49.490 --> 20:53.100
The startup cash, for convincing
my dad let me be here.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.560
- Bullshit. You wanted to see

20:54.560 --> 20:57.060
if your professor posted grades yet.

20:57.060 --> 21:00.260
- Seriously Eve your dad is the best.

21:00.260 --> 21:05.260
I wanted to thank him for
being rich and awesome.

21:06.178 --> 21:07.219
(laughing)

21:07.219 --> 21:09.913
You're still buzzed from
that one light beer.

21:09.913 --> 21:12.235
You can thank him in
person when we get home.

21:12.235 --> 21:14.430
He's probably busy right now anyways.

You don't like him cause your

21:58.877 --> 22:00.440
She needs to cool it with that shit.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.082
- Well, if it comes down to it,

22:02.082 --> 22:03.830
I'll throw it down on his ass.

22:03.830 --> 22:05.570

22:42.460 --> 22:44.270

22:44.270 --> 22:45.533
They'll catch up later.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.963
- Fucking Cabo right here. Let's go.

22:53.185 --> 22:55.768

23:00.203 --> 23:01.378
- Not bad.

23:01.378 --> 23:03.014

23:03.014 --> 23:06.220
- I got all your bags in the lounge area.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.680
So you found the alcohol.

23:07.680 --> 23:08.513
- Sorry.

23:10.130 --> 23:12.560
I hope it's cool we party.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.430

It's what it's here for.

23:15.430 --> 23:16.763
Waste not want not.

23:25.350 --> 23:27.893
To good times and good friends.

23:29.130 --> 23:30.660
May we have a safe trip

23:30.660 --> 23:32.961
and create memories to
be ashamed of later.

23:32.961 --> 23:35.044

23:41.184 --> 23:42.780

23:42.780 --> 23:44.573
Come on girls let me show
you where the rooms are.

23:48.007 --> 23:50.257
(laughing)

23:51.610 --> 23:53.240
There's a barbecue out on the deck

23:53.240 --> 23:55.160
some meats in the fridge.

23:55.160 --> 23:55.993
Help yourself.

24:01.439 --> 24:02.356
- The fuck.

24:03.290 --> 24:06.033
I don't like this Kirk
punk anymore either.

24:08.050 --> 24:08.983
- I told you bro.

24:11.386 --> 24:14.980
You know what? Fuck it let's
go check out the fridge.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.077
You can use a burger.

24:16.077 --> 24:18.744
(clears throat)

24:19.673 --> 24:22.256
(gentle music)

24:35.790 --> 24:38.373
(horn blaring)

24:44.987 --> 24:47.280
- All the girls are
passed out in their rooms.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.400
Chaz and Perry are still on the deck.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.393
- Thank you, Kirk.

24:52.191 --> 24:57.191
Kirk tells me he caught you
looking at one of those girls.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.573
Elle was it?

25:03.570 --> 25:04.403
- So?

25:05.720 --> 25:07.363
- Is that going to be a problem?

25:10.320 --> 25:11.290
I just don't understand

25:11.290 --> 25:12.800
why we can't have our ways with 'em.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.520
- He's got a point Maggie.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.520
I overheard Grace and Eve say
their parents are doctors.

25:17.520 --> 25:21.400
- I did not raise you boys
to be rapists and thieves.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.120
- But killing them is okay momma?

25:24.120 --> 25:25.993
- Leif we have been through this.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.327
What's the mantra sweet pea?

25:34.060 --> 25:39.060
- The act of killing restores
the balance of power.

25:44.230 --> 25:46.973
Killing make the world go round.

25:48.290 --> 25:49.454
- Amen.

25:49.454 --> 25:50.343
- Amen.

25:51.340 --> 25:52.453
- I'll be in my room.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.410
(burbling)

26:07.900 --> 26:09.420
- The girls call it a night already?

26:09.420 --> 26:11.030
- Yeah bro.

26:11.030 --> 26:14.480
- Lightweights. I'm ready for round nine.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.313
What do you want?

26:15.313 --> 26:17.700
- Whatever you having and double it.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.850
- I'll make sure that fuckhead
Kirk is in his own room too.

26:19.850 --> 26:21.659
- Jerking off that alcohol.

26:21.659 --> 26:23.716
(laughs)

26:23.716 --> 26:24.850
- Jesus.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.517
(ominous music)

26:29.930 --> 26:32.973
- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to frighten you.

26:34.150 --> 26:35.850
My name is Maggie.

26:35.850 --> 26:36.683
- Hi Maggie.

26:39.560 --> 26:42.000
I usually stay out of Kirk's business,

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
but I needed some fresh
air and I couldn't resist.

26:47.130 --> 26:47.963
Do you mind?

26:48.860 --> 26:50.833
- No, not at all.

26:53.260 --> 26:56.080
- So Kirk said, he had a
lot of family on the ship,

26:56.080 --> 26:57.710
but didn't mention any names.

26:57.710 --> 27:01.770
Yeah. I'll be out of
your hair in a minute.

27:01.770 --> 27:04.041
I just wanted to introduce myself,

27:04.041 --> 27:06.725
gets lonely down there sometimes.

27:06.725 --> 27:11.563
- We don't mind. We
appreciate your hospitality.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.800
- Say would you boys like a drink?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.563
I could use one myself.

27:22.180 --> 27:23.013
- Yeah.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.623
- Good.

27:33.476 --> 27:36.862
(upbeat music)

27:36.862 --> 27:39.112
(gurgling)

28:05.640 --> 28:07.630
You boys on spring break?

28:07.630 --> 28:08.463
- No.

28:09.830 --> 28:12.060
Well kinda (coughs)

28:13.060 --> 28:15.090
Grace is in a master's program

28:15.090 --> 28:18.973
'cause her dad's like a
military dude or whatever.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.321
But the rest of us
graduated a few years ago.

28:22.321 --> 28:24.210
Eve's dad invest in our startup company.

28:24.210 --> 28:26.787
We just launched so
we're here celebrating.

28:26.787 --> 28:30.550
Thanks again for your hospitality.

28:30.550 --> 28:31.740
- Yes, thank you.

28:31.740 --> 28:32.653
- My pleasure.

28:34.150 --> 28:36.403
- So tell me about your company.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.000
- We launched a dating app
for influential people.

28:43.210 --> 28:46.213
- What's that? Influential people?

28:47.270 --> 28:50.620
- Well it's for people
who have higher standards

28:50.620 --> 28:53.430
or requires some type of prestige.

28:53.430 --> 28:56.263
- You mean it's an app for rich people?

28:58.624 --> 29:01.113
- You could say that.

29:02.370 --> 29:04.783
- And are you boys one percenters?

29:05.710 --> 29:07.373
Seems like a lot of work.

29:09.950 --> 29:11.589
- It's a grind,

29:11.589 --> 29:13.903
but we've gotta make
those buku bucks somehow.

29:14.792 --> 29:17.743
- Seems you're doing fine already.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.863
What is that? The newest model?

29:22.871 --> 29:23.704
- What?

29:23.704 --> 29:27.140
- Your phone. Is that the latest model?

29:27.140 --> 29:30.640
- Yeah. As well be a brick though.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.020
Just don't have any service.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.770
Do you have wifi?

29:33.770 --> 29:35.643
- No, we don't.

29:37.490 --> 29:39.090
You'll have to wait for a day or two

29:39.090 --> 29:40.843
until we get closer to shore.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.893
As you were saying.

29:45.126 --> 29:50.126
- Our parents do well, but
we still gotta make a living.

29:50.660 --> 29:51.493
- Why?

29:53.221 --> 29:55.493
- I don't know. To make more money.

29:59.550 --> 30:01.160
- Did you go to college?

30:01.160 --> 30:02.710
- Of course. Doesn't everybody?

30:04.307 --> 30:06.557
(chuckles)

30:09.710 --> 30:11.160
- Where did you go to school?

30:12.710 --> 30:14.220
- Well, my family traveled a lot

30:14.220 --> 30:16.602
and we didn't have enough money

30:16.602 --> 30:19.452
and there was a lot of us, so
we couldn't even afford it.

30:22.330 --> 30:25.176
- I wasn't talking about college.

30:25.176 --> 30:28.073
I was talking about elementary school.

30:29.670 --> 30:31.023
- That's what I meant too.

30:32.860 --> 30:36.110
We didn't even have enough
money for clothes sometimes.

30:36.110 --> 30:39.020
My brother had to wear
my dresses (chuckles)

30:39.020 --> 30:41.303
so dad could buy us bus fare.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.693
He didn't like that one bit.

30:46.040 --> 30:49.413
We got picked on a lot.

30:51.010 --> 30:52.673
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

30:54.140 --> 30:55.340
- No way you could have.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.393
You are very lucky.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.853
You probably played football too.

31:02.978 --> 31:06.863
- Quarterback. Full ride back in the day.

31:07.777 --> 31:10.250
(chuckles)

31:10.250 --> 31:12.150
- You haven't even touched your drink.

31:13.010 --> 31:15.757
- I don't drink and smoke the same time.

31:15.757 --> 31:17.453
I've never liked mixing the taste.

31:18.490 --> 31:19.323
I will though.

31:21.230 --> 31:23.213
- Well, I'm gonna make myself another.

31:25.060 --> 31:25.963
I'll be back,

31:28.210 --> 31:29.043
in a minute.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.900
- Bro, you wanna wake up and
fucking help me out here.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.350
I sound like a fucking idiot.

31:44.549 --> 31:46.682
- Don't drink your drink.

31:46.682 --> 31:48.980
(coughs)

31:48.980 --> 31:50.180
She put something in it.

31:51.807 --> 31:54.560
- Do not fuck with me right now.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.010
Are you fucking with me Chaz?

31:57.230 --> 31:59.130
Chaz don't be pulling no shit with me.

32:01.668 --> 32:05.763
Chaz? Chaz? Wake up bro. Bro wake up.

32:39.153 --> 32:41.736
(upbeat music)

33:20.753 --> 33:23.420
(ominous music)

33:45.683 --> 33:47.933
(slugging)

33:53.975 --> 33:56.725
(dramatic music)

34:04.137 --> 34:05.720
Fucking shit. Fuck.

34:17.219 --> 34:18.136
Chaz! Chaz!

34:22.792 --> 34:23.958
Chaz! Help me.

34:26.835 --> 34:29.929
Help! Somebody help me please!

34:29.929 --> 34:31.502
Please.

34:31.502 --> 34:34.085
(sobs)

34:34.085 --> 34:36.782
(slugging)

34:36.782 --> 34:39.282
(eerie music)

34:56.728 --> 34:58.979
(clanging)

35:07.625 --> 35:09.034
(thuds)

35:09.034 --> 35:11.034
(sighs)

35:16.151 --> 35:18.401
(burbling)

35:21.768 --> 35:24.518
(dramatic music)

35:53.051 --> 35:55.301
(clanging)

35:57.751 --> 36:00.174
- Rise and shine you tired ass bitches.

36:00.174 --> 36:01.667
(laughing)

36:01.667 --> 36:02.573
- What happened?

36:02.573 --> 36:05.519
- You two were being fucking
nerds that's what happened.

36:05.519 --> 36:08.943
You only had like three
beers last night you pussies.

36:09.994 --> 36:12.150
- What is going on?

36:12.150 --> 36:13.140
What time is it?

36:13.140 --> 36:14.960
- It's time to party bitch.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.133
That's what time it is.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.017
- Have you seen Chaz or Perry?

36:18.017 --> 36:19.390
- No, I thought they were with you.

36:19.390 --> 36:20.840
- Who? The last I saw them

36:20.840 --> 36:22.020
they were eating burgers on the deck

36:22.020 --> 36:24.960
but we just checked and they're not there.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.390
Where are you hiding that...

36:26.390 --> 36:28.720
- They're probably hiding
in one of the cabins

36:28.720 --> 36:30.470
and sucking each other off.

36:30.470 --> 36:32.887
- Oh my god that would be so hot.

36:34.290 --> 36:35.341
- I know right.

36:35.341 --> 36:36.554
(laughing)

36:36.554 --> 36:37.530
- They probably just
wandering around the ship,

36:37.530 --> 36:39.470
and passed out in one of the rooms.

36:39.470 --> 36:41.120
Go look for them.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.955
(laughs)

36:42.955 --> 36:44.338
I need a shower.

36:44.338 --> 36:45.958
- Help me.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.254
(screams)

36:47.254 --> 36:49.156
There is like a million fucking rooms.

36:49.156 --> 36:50.801
(screaming)

36:50.801 --> 36:53.833
- [Elle & Emma] Chaz!
Perry! Where are you hiding?

36:53.833 --> 36:56.166
(screaming)

36:57.619 --> 37:00.452
Hello, Chaz! Perry! Where are you?

37:01.981 --> 37:04.512
(laughing)

37:04.512 --> 37:07.300
- There's no way they're still sleeping.

37:07.300 --> 37:08.710
I don't care how drunk I am.

37:08.710 --> 37:10.629
I don't sleep for 20 hours straight.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.713
Starting to piss me off now.

37:14.184 --> 37:16.210
When are we arriving in Cabo?

37:16.210 --> 37:18.716
I don't know some time tomorrow I think.

37:18.716 --> 37:20.950
(clanging)

37:20.950 --> 37:22.260
- Hey sleepy heads.

37:22.260 --> 37:23.093
- Hey Kirk.

37:23.093 --> 37:24.920
Have you seen Chaz or Perry?

37:24.920 --> 37:27.015
- Last time I saw them
I was with you guys.

37:27.015 --> 37:28.570
They were up here on the deck

37:28.570 --> 37:30.550
smoking cigarettes last night. Why?

37:30.550 --> 37:33.897
- We checked in all the cabins
we can't find them anywhere.

37:33.897 --> 37:37.055
- There's a lot more to this
ship that I didn't show you.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.550
They probably went down
to the lower levels.

37:39.550 --> 37:41.670
Exploring got lost.

37:41.670 --> 37:43.160
I'm sure they're fine.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.600
- Really?

37:44.600 --> 37:45.900
- Yeah.

37:45.900 --> 37:49.782
- In fact, I bet you didn't
went down to the engine room.

37:49.782 --> 37:51.410
It's easy to get lost in there.

37:51.410 --> 37:53.700
There is even a couple of
beds set up in the corner.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.510
They're probably passed out there.

37:55.510 --> 37:58.123
Wanna come look with me?

37:59.579 --> 38:00.412
- Sure.

38:03.239 --> 38:06.489
- Jesus Elle don't make it too obvious.

38:07.985 --> 38:10.697
(chuckles)

38:10.697 --> 38:12.864
(buzzing)

38:23.023 --> 38:25.690
(ominous music)

38:46.167 --> 38:48.584
(door slams)

38:59.530 --> 39:03.123
- I work down here
sometimes on longer trips.

39:15.490 --> 39:19.680
- I've never known a family
or anyone for that matter

39:19.680 --> 39:21.860
that lives on a cruise ship.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.533
I know it's kinda weird.

39:32.330 --> 39:33.580
- Are we gonna meet them?

39:34.490 --> 39:36.193
I thought you said they were on board.

39:37.330 --> 39:38.630
Well, I was gonna introduce you all

39:38.630 --> 39:42.070
at dinner tonight but
you just ruined that.

39:42.070 --> 39:44.573
- Oh my god really?

39:56.786 --> 39:58.780
They're not here.

39:58.780 --> 40:00.480
I could have sworn they'd be here.

40:06.110 --> 40:06.960
- That's too bad.

40:08.340 --> 40:10.573
- Why don't you tell me
what we're gonna do in Cabo?

40:12.928 --> 40:16.110
I was thinking Mai Tai's on the beach,

40:18.680 --> 40:19.770
I'm in my new bikini

40:21.660 --> 40:24.550
and you're right there, behind me

40:26.200 --> 40:27.750
putting lotion on my shoulders.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.538
- Stay protected, I like it.

40:31.538 --> 40:33.177
(laughing)

40:33.177 --> 40:37.040
- And then your hands
slip across my straps

40:37.040 --> 40:40.430
and my top falls off.

40:40.430 --> 40:44.170
- Bringing you tight, hold
you close so no one will see.

40:46.157 --> 40:47.407
- That's right.

40:51.798 --> 40:54.721
(clanging)

40:54.721 --> 40:57.388
(ominous music)

40:58.351 --> 41:00.518
(gasping)

41:08.990 --> 41:11.240
(groaning)

41:12.748 --> 41:14.998
(slugging)

41:19.546 --> 41:20.908
(screaming)

41:20.908 --> 41:23.442
(slugging)

41:23.442 --> 41:25.775
(screaming)

41:31.343 --> 41:33.273
- This isn't personal Elle.

41:34.347 --> 41:35.664
- I'm gonna do the same thing

41:35.664 --> 41:39.179
to your friends when I get the chance.

41:39.179 --> 41:41.429
(slugging)

41:42.336 --> 41:44.669
(screaming)

41:49.176 --> 41:51.426
(coughing)

42:00.713 --> 42:03.130
(whimpering)

42:09.000 --> 42:11.333
(screaming)

42:12.886 --> 42:15.636
(dramatic music)

42:20.477 --> 42:21.477
- Oh my god.

42:25.872 --> 42:28.205
(screaming)

42:59.796 --> 43:01.046
- Oh my! Oh my!

43:02.688 --> 43:05.355
(ominous music)

43:18.917 --> 43:21.334
(whimpering)

43:36.922 --> 43:38.922
(snaps)

43:52.093 --> 43:54.343
(burbling)

44:13.557 --> 44:15.474
- What happened to you?

44:16.963 --> 44:20.083
- Like momma always said, eat the rich.

44:21.820 --> 44:24.483
- Seriously, what happened?

44:27.720 --> 44:28.553
Who's blood it?

44:29.840 --> 44:30.673
Elle's?

44:34.760 --> 44:36.483
The only one I wanted for myself.

44:38.445 --> 44:39.820
- It just worked out that way.

44:39.820 --> 44:40.763
- How convenient.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.740
- I'm gonna need you to stop the ship.

44:45.060 --> 44:46.700
- Why?

44:46.700 --> 44:50.250
- Because we'll be in Cabo by tomorrow

44:50.250 --> 44:52.380
and I need more time to finish this.

44:52.380 --> 44:53.630
- You got plenty of time.

44:55.730 --> 44:57.223
- But I wanna enjoy it.

45:01.580 --> 45:02.413
- Yes sir.

45:04.617 --> 45:06.784
(chiming)

45:10.150 --> 45:11.600
What'd you do with the body?

45:11.600 --> 45:14.467
- Fish are feeding off it
a few miles back by now.

45:19.728 --> 45:21.223
I need to shower.

45:29.220 --> 45:31.470
(knocking)

45:32.420 --> 45:33.960
- Where the hell is Elle?

45:33.960 --> 45:37.216
And why the fuck are we stuck
in the middle of the ocean?

45:37.216 --> 45:40.160
- Slow down. Wait what?

45:40.160 --> 45:41.920
I can't find Elle anywhere.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.660
I still can't find Chaz and Perry

45:43.660 --> 45:46.393
and look out the window, we're not moving.

45:48.750 --> 45:49.750
- What do we do?

45:49.750 --> 45:51.430
- There has to be a reason for this.

45:51.430 --> 45:53.080
Get dressed and come with me.

45:53.080 --> 45:53.930
You too, come on.

45:59.527 --> 46:01.860
(footfalls)

46:04.625 --> 46:06.190
I swear to God if the three
of them are punking us,

46:06.190 --> 46:09.348
I'm cutting off their heads
and throwing 'em in the water.

46:09.348 --> 46:11.493
Who the fuck are you?

46:11.493 --> 46:14.653
- You want to know where your friends are?

46:18.160 --> 46:18.993
I'll tell you.

46:36.110 --> 46:37.800
- Can I offer you ladies a drink?

46:37.800 --> 46:40.510
- Shut up. Why isn't the ship moving?

46:40.510 --> 46:43.138
We're supposed to be in Cabo right now.

46:43.138 --> 46:44.050
I want answers.

46:44.050 --> 46:47.450
- You won't be stepping
foot off this ship.

46:47.450 --> 46:48.480
None of you will.

46:48.480 --> 46:51.707
- I don't understand. We
should be docking right now.

46:51.707 --> 46:53.400
- You entitled little twat.

46:53.400 --> 46:54.233
- Excuse me.

46:54.233 --> 46:55.607
- Hey fuck you hag.

46:55.607 --> 46:57.150
- When's the last time
you went to bed hungry?

46:57.150 --> 46:59.400
Or went out with holes in your shoes?

46:59.400 --> 47:02.700
or had to take up two
jobs in order to survive?

47:02.700 --> 47:03.533
Ever?

47:04.640 --> 47:05.590
- I'm not tracking.

47:06.903 --> 47:08.326
(laughs)

47:08.326 --> 47:09.430
- I don't expect you to.

47:09.430 --> 47:11.700
- She wants you to suffer Eve

47:11.700 --> 47:15.500
because she has her own personal
hang ups and insecurities.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.663
This is all textbook psycho shit.

47:19.380 --> 47:20.963
So what? Where are our friends?

47:21.937 --> 47:23.123
You have them just tied up somewhere?

47:24.390 --> 47:26.823
- It's far worse than that child.

47:28.130 --> 47:30.760
- I still don't understand.
What's happening?

47:30.760 --> 47:32.290
We know you don't Grace.

47:32.290 --> 47:35.690
Just sit there in your little bubble.

47:35.690 --> 47:37.890
Look, you may hate these two

47:37.890 --> 47:40.570
for being the divas that they are.

47:40.570 --> 47:42.440
But I don't know where you got this idea

47:42.440 --> 47:44.550
that I'm some princess riding

47:44.550 --> 47:47.200
to Mexico on daddy's credit cards.

47:47.200 --> 47:50.930
The only reason we're
on this bullshit boat is

47:50.930 --> 47:53.060
because I needed to save a dime.

47:53.060 --> 47:56.070
You have no idea what I've been through

47:56.070 --> 47:57.716
or what my family is about.

47:57.716 --> 47:59.880
- And I don't care.

47:59.880 --> 48:02.640
So what? We're just supposed
to run for our lives in fear

48:02.640 --> 48:04.553
while you hunt us down?

48:10.097 --> 48:12.133
- That's about it.

48:16.350 --> 48:17.600
- Why are you doing this?

48:18.790 --> 48:21.618
- Because it makes the world go round.

48:21.618 --> 48:23.398
- Tipping the scales for universal justice

48:23.398 --> 48:25.482
that's your bullshit philosophy?

48:25.482 --> 48:28.120
- A little simplistic and water down,

48:28.120 --> 48:30.303
but you've got the gist dear.

48:35.643 --> 48:36.976
- You know what?

48:38.393 --> 48:40.143
I think I will have that drink now.

48:46.463 --> 48:47.589
(dramatic music)

48:47.589 --> 48:49.149
- Oh my god what do we do?

48:49.149 --> 48:51.440
- Get out of here. I'm
gonna choke this bitch out

48:51.440 --> 48:53.229
until she tells us what's really going on.

48:53.229 --> 48:55.711
(coughs)

48:55.711 --> 48:57.720
- What's happening? I
don't know what to do.

48:57.720 --> 48:58.553
- I think we should go and talk--

48:58.553 --> 49:00.357
- Where is Kirk? If he's
here he can help us.

49:00.357 --> 49:01.580
- Let me think.

49:01.580 --> 49:03.250
We still have no signal in here.

49:03.250 --> 49:06.990
We need to find some
weapons or anything come on.

49:06.990 --> 49:09.529
(panting)

49:09.529 --> 49:12.431
(slugging)

49:12.431 --> 49:15.472
(footfalls)

49:15.472 --> 49:18.139
(ominous music)

49:25.342 --> 49:27.592
(slugging)

49:31.136 --> 49:33.469
(screaming)

49:43.090 --> 49:44.120
- Fucking cunt.

49:45.199 --> 49:46.127
- What the hell happened?

49:46.127 --> 49:48.420
- Making a mockery out of us.

49:48.420 --> 49:51.208
She claims she's not like the others.

49:51.208 --> 49:53.537
- What do you want me to do with her.

49:53.537 --> 49:58.177
- Jasper must have some pent
up aggression right about now.

49:58.177 --> 50:01.403
Perhaps he'll need a little release.

50:02.340 --> 50:03.453
It's only fair.

50:04.805 --> 50:05.873
And Leif,

50:09.390 --> 50:11.287
let Jesse have his cake too.

50:12.456 --> 50:14.789
(screaming)

50:24.557 --> 50:26.890
(screaming)

50:57.387 --> 50:59.260
- Jesus what happened to you?

50:59.260 --> 51:01.023
When Jasper is through with her

51:01.023 --> 51:02.756
I want you to make her suffer.

51:02.756 --> 51:03.948
- Which one?

51:03.948 --> 51:06.249
- That loud mouth bitch.

51:06.249 --> 51:07.370
- Where are the other two?

51:07.370 --> 51:08.690
- They're around here somewhere.

51:08.690 --> 51:10.233
I'm not worried about them.

51:11.400 --> 51:12.233
I wouldn't be surprised

51:12.233 --> 51:14.610
if they jumped off the ship in fear.

51:14.610 --> 51:15.443
Come on.

51:18.052 --> 51:20.385
(footfalls)

51:31.895 --> 51:34.312
(whimpering)

51:36.679 --> 51:37.530
What did I miss?

51:37.530 --> 51:39.057
If you're gonna kill me then kill me

51:39.057 --> 51:43.360
but if this psycho whips his
meat out I'm biting it off.

51:43.360 --> 51:46.140
- We are not perverts child.

51:46.140 --> 51:47.150
Is that what you think?

51:47.150 --> 51:52.150
Sex maniacs looking
for a cheap thrill? No.

51:52.160 --> 51:56.763
Jasper is the most kind
hearted man you will ever know.

51:57.870 --> 52:02.870
All he wants is to feel the
presence of a young woman.

52:04.280 --> 52:06.402
All he wants is the attention

52:06.402 --> 52:10.201
and consideration of the opposite gender.

52:10.201 --> 52:14.653
Something you get and take
for granted every day.

52:16.140 --> 52:18.913
So why does that make him a pervert?

52:20.660 --> 52:25.660
I suggest you savor this
moment before Jesse arrives.

52:26.454 --> 52:29.878
- You fucking (indistinct)

52:29.878 --> 52:31.320
- Before you dump her in the water,

52:31.320 --> 52:33.130
I wanna get my licks in

52:33.130 --> 52:35.793
so she can feel it
while she's still alive.

52:36.714 --> 52:38.881
(sobbing)

52:57.857 --> 53:00.190
(screaming)

53:02.419 --> 53:04.669
(rippling)

53:08.760 --> 53:10.237
- I'm still not getting anything.

53:10.237 --> 53:11.761
- They're probably all dead.

53:11.761 --> 53:12.962
- We don't know that for sure Grace.

53:12.962 --> 53:16.035
- If they're dead I can kill
myself. It's all my fault.

53:16.035 --> 53:18.263
I could have paid for the trip

53:18.263 --> 53:20.083
we'd be on the beach right now.

53:20.083 --> 53:21.777
- It's not true just shut up and focus.

53:21.777 --> 53:24.110
- Come on it's getting dark.

53:30.737 --> 53:33.404
(door creaking)

53:49.950 --> 53:53.050
(squeaking)

53:53.050 --> 53:55.963
- Jesse, my baby.

53:57.130 --> 53:58.943
We have a present for you.

54:05.096 --> 54:06.540
Come.

54:06.540 --> 54:08.790
(clapping)

54:09.993 --> 54:12.826
(chains clanking)

54:15.445 --> 54:17.778
(footfalls)

54:56.262 --> 54:58.679
(whimpering)

55:04.062 --> 55:06.395
(screaming)

55:10.830 --> 55:13.643
Pipe down missy. He's a good boy.

55:16.357 --> 55:18.850
(clanging)

55:18.850 --> 55:21.033
Will one of you do something?

55:21.033 --> 55:23.953
(clanging)

55:23.953 --> 55:26.120
(sobbing)

55:40.457 --> 55:43.480
You trying to kill yourself
to avoid the affections

55:43.480 --> 55:44.683
of this gentlemen?

55:48.620 --> 55:50.893
How do you think that makes him feel?

55:52.160 --> 55:55.490
You do not get that privilege my dear.

55:55.490 --> 55:57.583
Please be careful with his bandages.

55:58.420 --> 56:01.693
He's sensitive about
showing his face to a woman.

56:02.778 --> 56:06.043
Not so brazen now, are you my dear?

56:09.330 --> 56:13.260
Come on boys, let's leave
the men their privacy.

56:15.737 --> 56:17.904
(wailing)

56:42.621 --> 56:44.871
(clanging)

56:47.163 --> 56:49.413
(shouting)

57:02.369 --> 57:04.536
(heaving)

57:40.480 --> 57:43.813
(indistinct chattering)

58:23.476 --> 58:25.809
(footfalls)

58:26.997 --> 58:28.686
- Get dressed.

58:28.686 --> 58:29.519
- What's goin' on?

58:29.519 --> 58:31.650
We got ship stalled out
about four miles out.

58:31.650 --> 58:33.180
I've gotten three calls on it already.

58:33.180 --> 58:35.060
- Jones and his crew
are out there already.

58:35.060 --> 58:35.930
Can they check it out?

58:35.930 --> 58:37.090
- We're closer.

58:37.090 --> 58:38.650
And I already said we're on the way.

58:38.650 --> 58:39.483
Let's go.

58:41.566 --> 58:43.899
(footfalls)

58:46.334 --> 58:48.584
(rippling)

58:54.250 --> 58:56.260
- Hey, I see it. You wanna go on the horn?

58:56.260 --> 58:57.420
- Negative.

58:57.420 --> 58:59.413
We still have the rifles
will pull around the side.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.180
- Why don't we have to load up the rifles?

59:03.180 --> 59:05.110
The ship's not coming up in a system.

59:05.110 --> 59:07.364
This area is rife for piracy.

59:07.364 --> 59:08.783
Wanna take that chance big guy?

59:13.092 --> 59:14.491
(whimpering)

59:14.491 --> 59:16.132
- I'm sorry daddy.

59:16.132 --> 59:18.783
- I should have stayed home.

59:18.783 --> 59:21.405
- I should have never
taken along this boat.

59:21.405 --> 59:23.050
(horn blaring)

59:23.050 --> 59:25.040
Daddy come this way please.

59:28.979 --> 59:32.363
- Probably just some dumb
kids going to Cabo anyway.

59:34.660 --> 59:37.080
- Are you guys about ready?
I'm gonna pull up on the side

59:37.080 --> 59:38.550
and climb up on deck.

59:38.550 --> 59:40.753
Benji, Nick grab some ropes.

59:44.840 --> 59:46.490
- The hell is that?

59:46.490 --> 59:47.513
- Coast guard.

59:49.090 --> 59:49.983
- Shit.

59:50.890 --> 59:51.723
- It's fine.

59:53.370 --> 59:54.760
Let's be ready for 'em.

59:56.934 --> 59:59.684
(dramatic music)

1:00:17.914 --> 1:00:19.660
- We got backup coming?

1:00:19.660 --> 1:00:20.677
- For what?

1:00:20.677 --> 1:00:22.950
There's five of us. No immediate threat.

1:00:22.950 --> 1:00:25.300
Nick, Cates and Benji you
take the lower levels.

1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:26.800
Me and Vic we'll stay on top.

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:29.442
Y'all see anything. We're
on channel four, got it?

1:00:29.442 --> 1:00:30.324
- Got it.

1:00:30.324 --> 1:00:31.809
- Let's go.

1:00:31.809 --> 1:00:34.142
(footfalls)

1:00:53.401 --> 1:00:56.068
(ominous music)

1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:35.363
This is total bullshit man.

1:01:36.507 --> 1:01:40.650
- I heard that. Now just
do what the boss says.

1:01:40.650 --> 1:01:44.390
45 minutes we'll be back in
the ship cracking a cold one.

1:01:44.390 --> 1:01:45.490
- I hear that brother.

1:01:50.127 --> 1:01:53.350
- So one more room back
there. You sweep it.

1:01:53.350 --> 1:01:55.020
I'll meet you back on top.

1:01:55.020 --> 1:01:56.820
I'm gonna get started on the next floor.

1:01:56.820 --> 1:01:57.653
- Copy that.

1:02:32.306 --> 1:02:34.723
(whimpering)

1:02:51.233 --> 1:02:52.483
You okay ma'am?

1:02:58.025 --> 1:03:00.275
(slugging)

1:03:10.245 --> 1:03:13.078
(chains clinking)

1:03:38.166 --> 1:03:40.416
(slugging)

1:03:52.537 --> 1:03:55.370
(chains clinking)

1:04:04.674 --> 1:04:07.424
(dramatic music)

1:04:24.712 --> 1:04:26.879
(heaving)

1:04:41.771 --> 1:04:44.104
(whooshing)

1:05:12.363 --> 1:05:15.030
(ominous music)

1:05:28.546 --> 1:05:29.982
(gunfire)

1:05:29.982 --> 1:05:31.934
(slugs)

1:05:31.934 --> 1:05:32.767
(gunfire)

1:05:32.767 --> 1:05:34.528
(slugs)

1:05:34.528 --> 1:05:36.611
(groans)

1:05:47.570 --> 1:05:49.878
(heaving)

1:05:49.878 --> 1:05:52.672
(groaning)

1:05:52.672 --> 1:05:55.062
(slicing)

1:05:55.062 --> 1:05:56.896
(groans)

1:05:56.896 --> 1:05:59.024
(clattering)

1:05:59.024 --> 1:06:01.274
(slugging)

1:06:03.543 --> 1:06:05.264
(clanging)

1:06:05.264 --> 1:06:07.514
(slugging)

1:06:29.779 --> 1:06:31.946
(gunfire)

1:06:34.302 --> 1:06:36.469
(panting)

1:06:55.690 --> 1:06:57.530
- I was just attacked.

1:06:57.530 --> 1:07:00.050
Assailant is down there
could be more over.

1:07:00.050 --> 1:07:02.113
- [Dean] I heard the shots where are you?

1:07:05.719 --> 1:07:08.010
- I'm top side.

1:07:08.010 --> 1:07:09.210
- [Dean] What the hell you doing top side?

1:07:09.210 --> 1:07:10.360
I told you to go below.

1:07:11.950 --> 1:07:13.550
Are you injured?

1:07:13.550 --> 1:07:16.593
- I'm cut pretty bad,
but I'll manage over.

1:07:43.664 --> 1:07:45.060
- Did you hear that shot?

1:07:45.060 --> 1:07:45.893
- Yeah.

1:07:45.893 --> 1:07:46.726
- What happened?

1:07:46.726 --> 1:07:48.000
- It's Cates she's top side wounded.

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.128
- Shit.

1:07:49.128 --> 1:07:50.650
- Hey.

1:07:50.650 --> 1:07:54.510
- No, please don't shoot.
Thank God you're here.

1:07:54.510 --> 1:07:56.520
- Ma'am is anyone else in your party?

1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:58.178
No just me and my boys.

1:07:58.178 --> 1:07:59.957
Was that gunfire I
thought I heard gunfire.

1:07:59.957 --> 1:08:01.920
- Yes ma'am it was.

1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:03.360
We need to know exactly what's going on.

1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:04.760
Who else is on this ship.

1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:08.040
Well, just me and my boys
we were taken a hostage

1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:09.890
and locked into one of those cabins

1:08:09.890 --> 1:08:12.448
and I managed to escape just now.

1:08:12.448 --> 1:08:15.102
But they're still out
there walking around.

1:08:15.102 --> 1:08:19.850
Grace and Eve I think
that's what their names are.

1:08:19.850 --> 1:08:23.170
One of them has a pipe and
the other one has a knife.

1:08:23.170 --> 1:08:26.469
Oh my god they'll hurt
me again if they find me.

1:08:26.469 --> 1:08:27.920
I know they will.

1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:29.622
Calm down ma'am. You're safe now.

1:08:30.493 --> 1:08:32.660
(exhales)

1:08:33.830 --> 1:08:36.240
You wanna take her back to
our boat. I'll keep looking.

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:37.950
She's too old to make it down the rope.

1:08:37.950 --> 1:08:39.649
We need to wait for a rescue team.

1:08:43.202 --> 1:08:44.770
You believe her?

1:08:44.770 --> 1:08:47.069
- Why wouldn't I believe little old lady?

1:08:47.069 --> 1:08:49.620
She said one of them had
a knife and Cates was cut.

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:52.750
We still have at least one more suspect.

1:08:52.750 --> 1:08:55.639
We need to find before they
'cause any more damage.

1:08:55.639 --> 1:08:56.540
- You're the boss.

1:08:58.319 --> 1:09:01.210
- Stay here. Keep an eye
on her. I'll keep looking.

1:09:01.210 --> 1:09:03.069
- Should I call this in now?

1:09:03.069 --> 1:09:04.122
- Yeah. Call it in.

1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:07.530
- What's your name ma'am?

1:09:07.530 --> 1:09:08.894
- Sarah.

1:09:08.894 --> 1:09:12.720
- Sarah, you're gonna stay here
with Vic until help arrives.

1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:14.563
I'm gonna go find your sons.

1:09:16.969 --> 1:09:17.803
- Thank you.

1:09:20.719 --> 1:09:23.170
- Don't worry, ma'am.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:09:29.540 --> 1:09:31.574
- [Dean] Cates you there?

1:09:31.574 --> 1:09:33.280
- Yeah.

1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:34.800
- [Dean] We got one more suspect

1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:36.542
possibly armed with a knife or pipe.

1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:39.726
- How do you know that?

1:09:39.726 --> 1:09:41.065
- [Dean] We have old lady up here.

1:09:41.065 --> 1:09:42.312
Says her and her sons were kidnapped.

1:09:42.312 --> 1:09:43.922
Kidnappers are two girls

1:09:43.922 --> 1:09:45.532
still wandering around the ship.

1:09:46.660 --> 1:09:48.880
- Wait, I was attacked with a knife

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:49.816
but it was definitely a man.

1:09:49.816 --> 1:09:50.653
Are you sure?

1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:53.794
- [Dean] I'm positive.

1:09:55.121 --> 1:09:58.510
- Copy that, please hurry.

1:09:58.510 --> 1:09:59.660
- [Dean] I'm on my way.

1:10:01.701 --> 1:10:04.650
(ominous music)

1:10:04.650 --> 1:10:05.483
- Cates that's you?

1:10:05.483 --> 1:10:06.980
- Yeah, it's me.

1:10:06.980 --> 1:10:09.202
- Oh shit. Oh geez. Are you all right?

1:10:09.202 --> 1:10:10.793
Heard over the radio.

1:10:10.793 --> 1:10:11.626
- I'll live.

1:10:14.702 --> 1:10:17.369
(ominous music)

1:10:18.990 --> 1:10:20.467
- Benji get down.

1:10:20.467 --> 1:10:21.733
Get down now!

1:10:21.733 --> 1:10:23.900
(gunfire)

1:10:25.490 --> 1:10:26.323
- Damn it.

1:10:28.205 --> 1:10:31.743
- [Dean] What the fuck
is going on down there?

1:10:31.743 --> 1:10:34.076
(footfalls)

1:10:38.702 --> 1:10:41.120
(whimpering)

1:10:44.830 --> 1:10:45.980
- I'm glad to find you.

1:10:48.607 --> 1:10:53.190
- The two younger men, an
old woman they're killing us.

1:10:55.913 --> 1:10:57.966
They stopped the ship...

1:10:57.966 --> 1:11:01.463
- Wait. Stay with me sweetie. What else?

1:11:02.639 --> 1:11:03.923
- Please find Eve.

1:11:05.652 --> 1:11:07.902
(whimpers)

1:11:11.032 --> 1:11:12.473
- Dean Come in.

1:11:15.170 --> 1:11:19.143
Dean what the hell did
that old lady say? Dean?

1:11:20.910 --> 1:11:22.083
Where the hell are you?

1:11:23.340 --> 1:11:24.607
- Come on. Let's go.

1:11:26.159 --> 1:11:28.492
(footfalls)

1:11:34.100 --> 1:11:35.583
- Sarah stay here please.

1:11:36.910 --> 1:11:39.230
- I thought I had gunfire
shouldn't we check it out?

1:11:39.230 --> 1:11:41.083
- Stay in this room I'll find out.

1:11:42.690 --> 1:11:45.923
Did someone come in? I
heard rifle fire over.

1:11:49.010 --> 1:11:50.780
Will someone come in?

1:11:50.780 --> 1:11:52.820
- [Cates] This is Cates
the gunfire was mine.

1:11:52.820 --> 1:11:54.460
Took down a suspect but
I have some questions

1:11:54.460 --> 1:11:55.559
for that old lady.

1:11:55.559 --> 1:11:56.393
I wanna speak with her,

1:11:56.393 --> 1:11:58.040
is she still up there?

1:11:58.040 --> 1:11:59.200
- Why? What happened?

1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:00.309
- [Cates] Is she still there?

1:12:00.309 --> 1:12:01.469
She may not be telling the truth.

1:12:01.469 --> 1:12:02.447
- Yes, she's still here.

1:12:02.447 --> 1:12:04.605
(gunfire)

1:12:04.605 --> 1:12:06.688
(groans)

1:12:07.646 --> 1:12:09.910
(gunfire)

1:12:09.910 --> 1:12:11.700
- [Cates] Vic what was that? Are you okay?

1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:16.697
- Fucking hag tried to kill
me. I had to take her out.

1:12:18.090 --> 1:12:19.040
I took on the vest.

1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:22.160
Don't trust anybody.

1:12:23.362 --> 1:12:26.362
- Copy that. Top floors cleared
most cabin doors are locked.

1:12:27.262 --> 1:12:30.434
We are meeting at the lobby
for a new plan. Meet us there.

1:12:30.434 --> 1:12:32.048
Fuck.

1:12:32.048 --> 1:12:34.380
(footfalls)

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:37.928
- Drop it.

1:12:37.928 --> 1:12:39.884
- Who are you? Who are you shooting at?

1:12:39.884 --> 1:12:42.982
Have you found Grace?
What about the others?

1:12:42.982 --> 1:12:43.982
- Pipe down.

1:12:46.816 --> 1:12:50.180
- [Eve] I can explain if you let me speak.

1:12:50.180 --> 1:12:51.930
- Hey, she's unarmed.

1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:00.230
- Okay, let's hear it.

1:13:29.100 --> 1:13:32.850
(inhales and exhales deeply)

1:14:08.434 --> 1:14:10.767
(footfalls)

1:14:13.496 --> 1:14:16.559
- And that's the truth. I swear to you.

1:14:16.559 --> 1:14:18.490
You can handcuff me, take me off the ship.

1:14:18.490 --> 1:14:20.840
Do whatever you want,
but please find Grace.

1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:23.510
She's still alive and
unable to protect herself.

1:14:30.620 --> 1:14:32.773
What? Do you know where she is?

1:14:39.635 --> 1:14:42.763
- I think we may have already found her.

1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:47.933
Oh my god. They killed her?

1:14:49.050 --> 1:14:51.673
- The most important thing
right now is to keep you safe.

1:14:52.719 --> 1:14:54.059
We can account for one assailant.

1:14:54.059 --> 1:14:56.100
Vic took care of the old lady.

1:14:56.100 --> 1:14:57.110
Is there anyone else on the ship

1:14:57.110 --> 1:14:58.443
that's a threat to us?

1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:00.930
- Kirk.

1:15:00.930 --> 1:15:03.052
- Give us a description.

1:15:03.052 --> 1:15:07.219
- He's tall, strong. He's
really good at killing people.

1:15:07.219 --> 1:15:08.510
So don't listen to him.

1:15:08.510 --> 1:15:10.673
- We swept the entire
ship. We didn't see him.

1:15:11.577 --> 1:15:13.639
Are there any areas
that we might've missed?

1:15:13.639 --> 1:15:15.540
- Have you checked the bottom rooms?

1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:17.610
Kirk took us on a tour the other day

1:15:17.610 --> 1:15:19.950
and the entrance is
tucked behind a quarter.

1:15:19.950 --> 1:15:20.813
Hard to find.

1:15:22.150 --> 1:15:22.983
- Take us there.

1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:25.990
Benji. You stay here.

1:15:25.990 --> 1:15:28.120
Call in if you see anything.

1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:29.583
Have you seen Nick?

1:15:30.500 --> 1:15:32.100
I thought you knew where he was.

1:15:33.380 --> 1:15:36.295
Get a hold of him and get him up to speed.

1:15:36.295 --> 1:15:38.452
- Got it. Let's go.

1:15:52.514 --> 1:15:55.264
(dramatic music)

1:16:20.614 --> 1:16:21.447
- Fuck.

1:16:38.995 --> 1:16:40.077
- Emma? Emma!

1:16:42.036 --> 1:16:44.119
(crying)

1:17:08.237 --> 1:17:09.360
(squeaking)

1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:11.527
(gunfire)

1:17:13.179 --> 1:17:15.762
(mumbles) Vic.

1:17:16.598 --> 1:17:18.043
- Did you see his fucking face?

1:17:18.043 --> 1:17:20.109
You would have shot that
thing too if it came at you.

1:17:20.109 --> 1:17:22.520
- What the hell are you shooting at?

1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:25.593
- Oh no. Whatever it
is, it looks like shit.

1:17:28.003 --> 1:17:29.530
- I think I made the right call.

1:17:45.010 --> 1:17:46.036
(alarming music)

1:17:46.036 --> 1:17:46.869
- Shit.

1:17:46.869 --> 1:17:49.766
Fucking cool with me. How
about we cuff him this time

1:17:49.766 --> 1:17:51.143
and then we get some fucking answers.

1:18:06.441 --> 1:18:09.108
(ominous music)

1:18:17.740 --> 1:18:20.590
Rescue team is 30 minutes
out. Is this guy talkin'?

1:18:20.590 --> 1:18:22.250
- He's a fucking Mongoloid.

1:18:22.250 --> 1:18:24.143
I don't even think he understands English.

1:18:24.143 --> 1:18:25.993
He sure can't speak it.

1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:31.680
- All right. Keep an eye
on him till help arrives.

1:18:44.344 --> 1:18:47.011
(ominous music)

1:19:04.962 --> 1:19:07.712
- Stand down and drop the knives.

1:19:13.755 --> 1:19:16.088
(footfalls)

1:19:23.969 --> 1:19:26.293
Drop the knives or I open fire.

1:19:30.636 --> 1:19:32.803
(gunfire)

1:19:57.342 --> 1:19:59.342
(slugs)

1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:22.160
- Benji, what the fuck
is goin' on up there?

1:20:24.540 --> 1:20:25.373
Benji.

1:20:26.900 --> 1:20:30.217
Cates keep her safe.
Cates take cover come on.

1:20:31.642 --> 1:20:32.559
- Let's go.

1:20:36.172 --> 1:20:37.005
Get down.

1:20:38.842 --> 1:20:41.592
(dramatic music)

1:21:01.529 --> 1:21:03.862
(footfalls)

1:21:24.290 --> 1:21:25.243
- Light him up.

1:21:25.243 --> 1:21:27.410
(gunfire)

1:22:08.971 --> 1:22:11.304
(screaming)

1:22:14.028 --> 1:22:17.760
- Get down. Get down.
What the fuck is she doing?

1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:18.593
Damn it.

1:22:20.226 --> 1:22:21.715
(clattering)

1:22:21.715 --> 1:22:24.109
(screaming)

1:22:24.109 --> 1:22:25.428
(gunfire)

1:22:25.428 --> 1:22:26.678
Hold your fire.

1:22:29.870 --> 1:22:30.702
Please.

1:22:31.564 --> 1:22:33.768
(screams)

1:22:33.768 --> 1:22:35.518
Vic grab the old man.

1:22:40.850 --> 1:22:44.146
Let her go. We'll kill the old man.

1:22:44.146 --> 1:22:46.687
We'll fucking kill him.

1:22:46.687 --> 1:22:48.603
(sobs)

1:22:50.686 --> 1:22:53.207
- We're fucking kill him.

1:22:53.207 --> 1:22:55.540
(screaming)

1:23:05.478 --> 1:23:07.645
(gunfire)

1:23:48.700 --> 1:23:50.940
Gimme the word boss. I'll
do this retard the same way

1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:52.820
before second team gets here.

1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:55.163
- Let him think about what
he's looking at for a while.

1:23:57.507 --> 1:23:58.452
- Then what?

1:24:04.020 --> 1:24:06.920
- Let him live out the rest
of his miserable fucking life.

1:24:11.482 --> 1:24:13.648
(wailing)

1:24:37.157 --> 1:24:39.741
(gentle music)

1:27:07.748 --> 1:27:10.581
(thunder rolling)

1:27:27.719 --> 1:27:28.803
- Hi, Mr. Kershaw.

1:27:31.430 --> 1:27:34.074
I'm petty officer Cates
we spoke on the phone.

1:27:34.074 --> 1:27:35.973
May I speak with you?

1:27:38.490 --> 1:27:39.323
- I'm here.

1:27:41.830 --> 1:27:43.170
- I wanted to inform you

1:27:43.170 --> 1:27:45.433
that we've identified four of the killers.

1:27:46.350 --> 1:27:48.719
We're still looking into a fifth one

1:27:48.719 --> 1:27:52.353
but he doesn't speak much to us.

1:28:00.790 --> 1:28:02.193
Are you okay Mr. Kershaw?

1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:07.233
I can come back at another time.

1:28:08.380 --> 1:28:10.383
- Grace never wanted to go on that ship.

1:28:13.230 --> 1:28:16.590
I even offered to cover trip
for her and her friends.

1:28:16.590 --> 1:28:19.883
If they simply took a plane
and stayed at a resort.

1:28:22.848 --> 1:28:25.793
She didn't wanna offend Elle and Emma.

1:28:28.070 --> 1:28:31.770
- From what I understand,
she was a good person.

1:28:31.770 --> 1:28:33.670
Bright, intelligent.

1:28:33.670 --> 1:28:34.873
- You didn't know her.

1:28:35.809 --> 1:28:38.809
When you found her she was
already dead on that ship, right?

1:28:40.227 --> 1:28:44.400
- We're still looking into
who killed who exactly.

1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:45.653
- Bullshit come on.

1:28:46.740 --> 1:28:49.469
You know, you people always know.

1:28:49.469 --> 1:28:51.830
you know exactly what happened.

1:28:51.830 --> 1:28:55.139
- Mr. Kershaw, there's
a reason why I asked

1:28:55.139 --> 1:28:56.671
to speak with you.

1:28:56.671 --> 1:28:58.790
It's something I wanted to clear up,

1:28:58.790 --> 1:29:01.353
so that we could both put
this horrible thing behind us

1:29:01.353 --> 1:29:03.509
and move on.

1:29:03.509 --> 1:29:05.133
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.

1:29:06.219 --> 1:29:07.053
And what is it?

1:29:08.350 --> 1:29:11.851
Grace didn't die by the
hands of the killers.

1:29:11.851 --> 1:29:15.623
She was accidentally killed
by one of the members,

1:29:17.559 --> 1:29:19.120
a member of our team.

1:29:20.505 --> 1:29:21.883
- What?

1:29:23.910 --> 1:29:25.083
- It was dark.

1:29:26.670 --> 1:29:29.270
We had very little intel at the time.

1:29:29.270 --> 1:29:31.070
She was holding a knife.

1:29:31.070 --> 1:29:32.590
- Your team gunned her down?

1:29:32.590 --> 1:29:33.680
It was an accident.

1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:36.123
- Accident or not. My baby girl is dead.

1:29:39.270 --> 1:29:41.270
So why were you compelled to tell me this?

1:29:41.270 --> 1:29:42.520
- Because it's the truth.

1:29:43.431 --> 1:29:45.173
And you deserve to know the truth.

1:29:46.900 --> 1:29:51.170
- I wanna know specifically
who killed my baby girl.

1:29:51.170 --> 1:29:54.153
Mr. Kreshaw I know that
you are upset right now

1:29:54.153 --> 1:29:55.200
and you want vengeance for what happened.

1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:57.389
- God dammit quit your hemming and hawing

1:29:57.389 --> 1:29:58.853
give me a fucking name.

1:29:59.719 --> 1:30:02.940
I want the name of the
motherfucker who pulled the trigger

1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:04.620
that killed my baby girl.

1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:06.823
Now give me a goddamn fucking name.

1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:16.593
- It was me.

1:30:21.230 --> 1:30:22.573
I'm so sorry.

1:30:25.012 --> 1:30:27.844
(thunder rolling)

1:30:41.291 --> 1:30:43.541
(slugging)

1:30:59.896 --> 1:31:01.770
- [Voiceover] We may die.

1:31:01.770 --> 1:31:03.623
But the world keeps turning.

1:31:04.650 --> 1:31:07.910
An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind,

1:31:07.910 --> 1:31:10.923
except for the last person with one eye.

1:31:12.460 --> 1:31:14.627
Rest in peace my family.

1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:19.743
(upbeat music)
