less than perfection.

work today.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.600
- Thanks, you too.

09:03.633 --> 09:05.567
- Give me five
for a great night.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.667
- One, two, and a chop.

09:09.734 --> 09:11.533
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good.

09:11.567 --> 09:12.700
- We'll see you in the morning.
- All right.

I think
dinner service was good.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.533

09:28.567 --> 09:31.600
a charter guest leave early.
- And later...

09:31.633 --> 09:33.333

It's my favorite couple.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.433

why would you lead me on?

Tiny little things.

- No, no, no.
Not on the service side at all.

09:53.100 --> 09:56.033
Just a couple of really small,
minor details that were missed.

09:56.066 --> 09:59.600
So in the master stateroom,
there was some,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.600
I think, towels left
from a previous guest.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.633
- It's these little things
a lot of people would not see.

10:07.633 --> 10:10.066
But so far,
everybody is delightful.

10:10.100 --> 10:13.100
The food was excellent.
Your chef is absolutely amazing.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.066

Sandy's happy.

Sandy's not happy.

we're gonna stay here
at the dock.

11:08.066 --> 11:11.700
So now we have
to really pour it on.

11:11.700 --> 11:15.133
Because they're expecting
water toys, anchoring.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.567
What do you think, Hannah?
- Yeah, of course.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.767
I'm thinking
we can do a spa day.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.633
I could try and do
a tour of the palace.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.233
There's not really a lot we can
do on the water in this weather.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.266
When Sandy gets stressed,
she tends to micromanage.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.700
- Throw all this sh-- away.
Fold those towels up,

11:29.700 --> 11:31.633
and give me that trash can.
Where does this go?

11:31.667 --> 11:33.533
It isn't like you're gonna
sort it out tonight.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.567

away, like, properly.

11:35.567 --> 11:37.266
- That's not gonna be the case.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.500
- And there's already tension
within the crew.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.033
So I'm really hoping

11:42.033 --> 11:43.700
that she doesn't
get carried away

11:43.734 --> 11:46.200
and start stressing
everyone else out.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.467
- We just got to pull out
everything we can this evening.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.133
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks, Sandy.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.700
- All right.
- Cool. All righty, deck crew.

11:52.734 --> 11:54.600
We're not going anywhere today,
so between all of us,

11:54.600 --> 11:56.266
we're just gonna clean up
wherever we can, you know?

11:56.300 --> 11:58.066
Just make the boat
look good the whole time.

11:58.066 --> 12:00.033
Make sure the jacuzzi's
always full and hot

12:00.066 --> 12:01.066
'cause it's one of those days
that they might just jump in

12:01.100 --> 12:02.533
and want to enjoy that.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.033
Making Malia lead deck
in public

12:04.066 --> 12:05.734
is actually
a bit nerve-wracking.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.600
I'm nervous I'm not gonna
get the reaction I want.

12:07.633 --> 12:09.200
I don't know how you can prepare
for something like this.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.734

sweeping some decks,

12:10.734 --> 12:12.600
do some windows and stuff. Boom.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.734
driving out there today.

12:18.767 --> 12:20.734
It's gale force winds.
They're not--

12:20.734 --> 12:25.300
- Yeah. So are we not able
to go to that beach, or--

12:25.333 --> 12:27.300
- Not in this boat.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.700
I don't want to disappoint
anyone that's onboard,

12:29.734 --> 12:31.300

the winds are,

12:31.333 --> 12:34.100
like, 27, 30 knots.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.100
Not gonna happen.
It's dangerous.

are not on the water toys,

- So I just want to make sure
that they're well fed.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.767

Yeah, no problem.

Thank you so much.
- Yeah, my pleasure.

too some of the crew

13:19.667 --> 13:21.367
are trained to do massage

have more history."

It's Hannah calling from

14:07.033 --> 14:08.667
motor yacht "Sirocco."

I was hoping if you could
arrange two masseuses

14:11.166 --> 14:13.033
to come to the yacht.

14:13.033 --> 14:16.033
These guests spent a lot
of money chartering this yacht.

14:16.033 --> 14:18.300
There is no refund,
so the whole crew

14:18.300 --> 14:20.667
really needs to concentrate on
giving these guests

14:20.700 --> 14:22.233
the most perfect service

14:22.266 --> 14:24.166
we possibly can
in the circumstances.

14:24.166 --> 14:27.166

14:27.166 --> 14:28.667
On sun deck
and work our way down?

14:28.700 --> 14:31.166

14:31.200 --> 14:33.333
- I've always been rewarded
for my hard work.

14:33.367 --> 14:35.300

at a surf shop.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.066
Within a month in a half,

14:37.066 --> 14:39.300
I got a 50 cent raise
because I was never over

14:39.333 --> 14:41.266
or under ten cents
in my cash drawer.

14:41.300 --> 14:44.133
That stuck with me.
You work hard, you get rewarded.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.734
So hopefully one day I can go

14:45.734 --> 14:48.166
from cleaning the boat
to driving the boat.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.734
- You grew up in the same
town, yeah?

14:50.734 --> 14:52.166
- My entire life.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.200
- The same one that you live
in now?

14:53.200 --> 14:54.600
- Yep.

14:54.633 --> 14:56.166
- My class was less
than 100 people.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.333
- Oh, my God.
That's really small.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.734
- Oh, yeah.
I'm stoked about this promotion,

15:00.734 --> 15:03.333
but at the same time I feel
a little guilty, you know?

15:03.333 --> 15:05.200
Like, Bobby's
a really hard worker.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.600
I think he really wants
to be lead deckhand,

15:07.600 --> 15:10.266
so I am scared sh--less

15:10.300 --> 15:12.600
'cause it's probably not gonna
go over very well.

15:12.633 --> 15:15.734

15:21.200 --> 15:23.633
- Really?
- Yeah. Unfortunately,

15:23.667 --> 15:25.433
the wind has picked up.
- Yep.

15:25.467 --> 15:30.100
- And it's freezing out there.
- Ugh.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.367
- I'm sorry. I know it's
a little bit disappointing.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.700
- Yeah. It is what
it is, you know?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.633
- They're, like, not happy that
we're not doing anything today.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.467
- I wanted to see that beach.
- Yeah, I'm totally bummed.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.233

- Thank you.

15:44.233 --> 15:45.767
Here you go.
- Thanks.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.633
At least we got
fed well, right?

15:47.667 --> 15:49.367
- I actually feel sorry
for them.

15:49.367 --> 15:52.233
In this weather, I would rather
be in a hotel on land,

15:52.233 --> 15:54.100
to be honest.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.066
- Me too.
- I would not like

15:56.100 --> 15:57.400
to be on a yacht.
- Yeah, but the hotel

15:57.400 --> 16:01.000
doesn't give you
this kind of service.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.400
- I'd just prefer
to order room service.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.200
- I'd just get room service.

36:44.467 --> 36:47.700
- You don't seem all right.
- Well, you know,

36:47.734 --> 36:49.467
a little bummed, you know?

36:49.467 --> 36:51.066
It's like--
- Okay, you obviously heard

36:51.100 --> 36:53.133
about what
everyone's been talking about.

36:53.166 --> 36:55.667
- Yeah, yeah. It's like,
after the first issue,

36:55.700 --> 36:57.433
we had a good,
long chat and it was like,

36:57.467 --> 36:59.200
"No, we're done.
Everything's done."

36:59.233 --> 37:01.300
Even this guy.
We're like, "Nah, we're done."

37:01.333 --> 37:04.166
- To each other?
- Yeah, and then additionally

37:04.200 --> 37:07.567
to that--of course, I'm not sure
if you're aware of this or not,

37:07.600 --> 37:10.600
but we met at the yachting
certification course

37:10.600 --> 37:12.333
before we even got on the boat.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.066
- Who did, you and Wes?
- Malia and I.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.600
- And how long ago was that?
Was that recent?

37:15.633 --> 37:17.467
- Yeah, that was--we both had

37:17.467 --> 37:19.533
to get it to get on this boat.

37:19.567 --> 37:21.600
And we fooled around.
- Wow.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.467
We tried to keep it hush hush.
- Yeah. Jeez,

37:24.467 --> 37:26.433
I really had
no idea about that at all.

37:26.467 --> 37:28.066
This is like--
- Yeah, like, I thought

37:28.100 --> 37:30.367
I had, you know,
a little hook in her,

37:30.367 --> 37:31.633
but I was so wrong.

37:31.633 --> 37:33.500
It can't be a secret anymore.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.633
I've got to save
my own face here.

37:35.667 --> 37:38.700
And she told me that
she's not into him whatsoever

37:38.734 --> 37:40.600
and that she's into me.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.233
- She told you this?
- Oh, yeah.

37:42.266 --> 37:43.633
- Was this when
she ended stuff with you?

37:43.667 --> 37:45.700
- Yeah, I got all
the texts to prove it.

37:45.734 --> 37:49.633
"The more I thought about it
all night on my anchor watch,

37:49.633 --> 37:52.300
"I don't want to go on a date
with Wes.

37:52.333 --> 37:54.233
Hope you slept well.
Missing you."

37:54.266 --> 37:57.367
These texts were
the exact same night

37:57.400 --> 37:59.567
that she was making out
with Wes in the wheelhouse.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.300
"We can just make plans for
when you're done

38:01.333 --> 38:03.166
"with your Boston trip.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.633
"Hopefully we can sneak into
the same hotel room

38:05.633 --> 38:08.500
our last night in Croatia."

38:08.533 --> 38:11.133
I'm f---ing blown away.
[laughs]

38:11.133 --> 38:12.500
- I think she's confused.

38:12.533 --> 38:14.400
- If you're lying,
you're not confused.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.266
You're a liar.
- Yeah.

38:17.266 --> 38:20.266
- All crew,
we have arrived in Dubrovnik.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.400
It's beautiful. Take a look.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.233
- Oh, my gosh.

38:24.266 --> 38:25.500
- Oh, this is awesome.
- That's pretty, huh?

38:25.533 --> 38:27.333
- Wow.

38:27.367 --> 38:29.266
- Dubrovnik is a beautiful
walled city

38:29.266 --> 38:31.200
that dates back
to the 7th century,

38:31.233 --> 38:34.133
and it's like you're walking
right back into history.

38:34.133 --> 38:35.633
We're going between two boats.

38:35.667 --> 38:37.333
- All right, straight back there
is our channel, Cap.

38:37.367 --> 38:39.200
We are in line.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.400
- Four meters and opening
on starboard.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.500
- Get the lines ashore.

38:41.533 --> 38:44.233
- Copy that.

38:44.266 --> 38:46.133
- Our crossovers are secure.

38:46.133 --> 38:48.667
- Well done, everyone.

38:48.667 --> 38:50.467
- Whoo!

38:50.500 --> 38:52.533
- Bobby, why don't you show me
the mangina?

38:56.300 --> 38:58.166
- Two charters back.
- Yeah.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.700
You know, I just wanted to go
back and look

38:59.700 --> 39:02.166
at my text messages that were
happening that same day.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.633
- Oh, you had been texting?
- Oh, yeah.

39:04.667 --> 39:07.166
- Is it raining, raining?
- No, I think it's just--

39:07.166 --> 39:08.433
- Not raining
right now actually.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.300
- Oh, I'm hot.

39:10.300 --> 39:12.567
- I'm getting off this boat.
This day is much needed.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.300
- Let's go grab a beer,
right, boys?

39:15.300 --> 39:19.166
- After all the drama in
the whole lead deckhand role,

39:19.200 --> 39:22.166
I'm so excited to actually have
a drama-free night.

39:22.166 --> 39:24.433
- Hey, you know what
we should do? An Irish car bomb.

39:24.433 --> 39:27.433
- Yes.
- Is this the shot?

39:27.433 --> 39:29.300
- That's a car bomb, boy.
You drop it in, you go for it.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.633
- Oh, I can't chug anything.
- Ready?

39:31.667 --> 39:34.233
Cheers, boys.

39:37.300 --> 39:38.467
- Would you like
some more, boys?

39:38.467 --> 39:39.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's do

39:39.700 --> 39:41.567
another car bomb.
- All right.

39:41.600 --> 39:45.533
- Later, skaters. Adam's going
to Drunk Town, you know?

39:45.567 --> 39:47.333
Let's do this.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.467
- Now that this whole lead
deckhand thing happened...

39:49.467 --> 39:51.333
- Yeah.
- If you were

39:51.367 --> 39:53.467
a true professional in my eyes,
you wouldn't do this

39:53.467 --> 39:56.266
because you know this is
how it will turn out.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.467
- Yeah, but look how that looks
to everyone else on the boat.

39:58.467 --> 39:59.667
- Yeah.
- You know they made out

39:59.700 --> 40:01.467
on anchor watch as well?

40:01.467 --> 40:03.533
We found out yesterday.
- I just found out.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.467
It was pretty hard to swallow.
- I think I need to go find

40:05.467 --> 40:07.467
some testosterone in my life.
- I think you should.

40:07.467 --> 40:11.033
- The f---ing guy
sleeps three feet above me,

40:11.066 --> 40:13.200
- Yeah,
- And sometimes I just want to,

40:13.200 --> 40:16.367
like--bam!

40:16.367 --> 40:17.500
Like, right through the ceiling.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.233
It's so weird living on a yacht.

40:19.233 --> 40:20.767
Like, you have problems
with someone

40:20.767 --> 40:22.500
and "Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna go
sleep next to you."

40:22.500 --> 40:26.467
- What's up, gentle folk?
- Oy, oy.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.233
- Ah, Adam.
- Okay, that's unnecessary.

40:29.233 --> 40:31.367
Hey. Hey, f---ing stop, Adam.

40:31.367 --> 40:33.033
F---, Bro.

40:33.066 --> 40:34.233
- Smile there, big guy.
- You just ripped

40:34.266 --> 40:36.433
my f---ing pants, Adam.

40:39.767 --> 40:40.400
- You know, what's driving me

40:40.400 --> 40:40.767
- You know, what's driving me
crazy is the f---ing guy

40:42.767 --> 40:45.333
sleeps three feet above me.
- Yeah.

40:45.367 --> 40:50.433
- And sometimes I just
wanna, like--bam!

40:50.467 --> 40:52.367
- What's up, gentle folk?
- Oy, oy.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.500
- And now it's Irish car
bomb time since you're here.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.333
- Yeah.
- Oh, let me have a pee first.

40:56.367 --> 40:57.500
Right, I'll be back out.
- As long as you don't just

40:57.533 --> 40:58.734
get so drunk you f--- Malia.

40:58.767 --> 41:00.667
That's all that matters to me.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.400
♪ ♪

41:02.433 --> 41:04.667
- Can we get a glass
of dry white wine?

41:04.700 --> 41:06.633
- Okay.

41:06.667 --> 41:10.533
- I'm been pretty on edge
after this promotion thing,

41:10.533 --> 41:12.066
you know?

41:12.100 --> 41:13.266
'Cause I don't want people
to feel like

41:13.300 --> 41:15.533
it's a Bobby vs. Malia.

41:15.567 --> 41:17.467
- I don't--I really
don't think it is.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.000
That's Captain Sandy's decision.
She's the captain.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.767
She made her decision
for a reason.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.600
- I get why he's frustrated.
I don't disagree with him.

41:23.633 --> 41:25.467
- There's something going
on there.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.400
I thought she was
this sweet, innocent,

41:27.433 --> 41:29.533
cute girl who didn't know
how cute she was.

41:29.567 --> 41:32.400
But right now I don't trust her.

41:32.433 --> 41:35.533
- Whenever you're
the cute female that your boss

41:35.533 --> 41:37.367
or anyone else is into,
it's kind of hard.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.767
- Yeah.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.433
- Let's get Adam f---ing faded.

41:41.433 --> 41:45.100
Yoo! Yoo! Yoo!

41:45.133 --> 41:47.033
- These guys are already
hammered right now

41:47.066 --> 41:50.433
Absolutely next level.
- Cheers. Hey, oh!

41:50.433 --> 41:53.033
- And Adam's way more wasted
than anyone I've seen before,

41:53.033 --> 41:55.433
and I think he's kind
of turned to alcohol

41:55.433 --> 41:57.667
to solve his problem
of his heartbreak.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.166
- All right, should we go
for a little stroll?

41:59.166 --> 42:00.700
- Let's rock and roll, boys.

42:00.700 --> 42:03.667
- Do you have a car bomb?
Oh, see you later.

42:03.700 --> 42:07.000
I love you. I love you both.
I love you.

42:07.033 --> 42:10.567
I love you. Thank you. Thank you
so much. I love you too. Okay.

42:10.567 --> 42:12.300
- My God.

42:12.300 --> 42:14.033
It's embarrassing,
and it's obnoxious,

42:14.033 --> 42:16.133
and he's definitely lost
all his respect in my books.

42:16.166 --> 42:17.700
- Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

42:17.700 --> 42:20.500
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
You f---ing asshole.

42:20.533 --> 42:22.400
- Adam, stop.
- He's f---ing lost his mind.

42:22.433 --> 42:25.066
- Hey!
- Hey, girls.

42:25.066 --> 42:27.066
- Hey, boys.

42:27.066 --> 42:30.433
[laughter]

42:30.467 --> 42:34.066
- Your guys' photo.
Hey, no! Photo!

42:34.066 --> 42:38.467
- Bobby!

42:38.467 --> 42:40.066
- Oh, my God.
- Bobby.

42:40.066 --> 42:42.467
- Never been wedgied
that bad in my life.

42:42.467 --> 42:45.066
- Ah, Adam.
Okay, that's unnecessary.

42:45.066 --> 42:47.433
- Hey, hey.
F---ing stop, Adam.

42:47.467 --> 42:51.166
F---, bro.
- [laughs] Smile.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.667
- What are you guys doing?
- Smile there, big guy.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.433
- He just ripped
my f---ing pants, Adam.

42:54.467 --> 42:55.734
- Hey, you getting
all f---ing intense?

42:55.734 --> 42:58.066
- Wes, Wes--
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

42:58.100 --> 43:02.700
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
- No, no, no.
