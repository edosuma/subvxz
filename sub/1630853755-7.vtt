like something doesn't mean

13:23.282 --> 13:25.186
you can't experience it.

13:25.219 --> 13:28.226
Jesse thinks
carne asada is exotic.

13:28.259 --> 13:30.498
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

13:30.531 --> 13:33.002
-I'm gonna have to save you
from, your, uh...
-Hmm.

13:33.035 --> 13:34.371
your sad existence.

13:34.404 --> 13:36.208
-Oh, my...
-Jalapeño chips to the rescue!

13:36.241 --> 13:37.612
Free yourself!

13:37.645 --> 13:39.515
-Expand your horizons! (laughs)
-Stop!

13:40.918 --> 13:43.891
This guy had a lot of people
who loved him.

13:43.924 --> 13:48.066
Would your family do a whole
dog and pony show for you?

13:48.099 --> 13:51.338
Uh... no.

13:51.371 --> 13:53.977
They on board with your whole
obsession with death?

13:55.581 --> 13:57.552
I hope so.

13:57.585 --> 14:00.089
They're all dead.

14:01.125 --> 14:04.064
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

14:05.601 --> 14:07.638
I like talking about them.

14:11.011 --> 14:13.584
My Dad-- he was, um...

14:13.617 --> 14:17.124
he was such a stud.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.496
He'd taken us to Zion

14:19.529 --> 14:22.635
'cause he liked
these big, stupid rocks.

14:22.668 --> 14:25.340
My mom hated the outdoors.
She couldn't stand the heat,

14:25.373 --> 14:28.446
the bugs,
but she loved my dad.

14:28.479 --> 14:31.185
Sadie was a total
Daddy's girl.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.289
She'd follow him anywhere.

14:33.322 --> 14:34.659
DAD:
Charlie?

14:34.692 --> 14:36.195
Dad was telling
this dumb joke.

14:36.228 --> 14:37.430
I got a joke for you.
You ready, bud?

14:37.463 --> 14:38.934
CHARLIE:
His jokes were so corny.

14:38.967 --> 14:41.506
This one got me.
Something about a...

14:41.539 --> 14:44.278
a monkey and a hyena.

14:44.311 --> 14:45.548
DAD:
Chimpanzee.

14:45.581 --> 14:46.448
(laughing like monkey)

14:46.481 --> 14:48.352
(horn honking)

14:49.187 --> 14:50.591
(glass breaking)

14:50.624 --> 14:53.262
In a way, it was a blessing.

14:56.068 --> 14:58.574
I don't... I don't understand.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.343
Having such
a close brush with death

15:00.376 --> 15:02.347
brought everything
into clear focus.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.484
I saw how precious life is.

15:06.255 --> 15:09.361
And how we as the living
owe it to the dead

15:09.394 --> 15:11.198
to take care of them.

15:11.231 --> 15:13.335
And to live boldly.

15:18.379 --> 15:20.517
I know exactly how you feel.

15:21.586 --> 15:24.057
Did some drunk driver
take out your entire family

15:24.090 --> 15:26.228
as well in a blaze of glory?

15:32.575 --> 15:35.212
Trauma is, uh...

15:39.154 --> 15:41.626
It's complicated.

15:44.665 --> 15:46.736
It, um...

15:51.478 --> 15:54.250
It fucks with your... brain.

15:56.421 --> 15:59.360
Hey, I-I thought we were talking
about my dead family.

16:01.532 --> 16:03.670
I don't talk about mine, ever.

16:05.774 --> 16:08.513
Not with Jesse, not with, uh...

16:08.546 --> 16:10.650
well, anyone.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.426
But right now, I, um...

16:21.238 --> 16:23.408
I want to.

16:28.285 --> 16:30.156
(phone rings)

16:30.189 --> 16:32.595
Hmm.

16:32.628 --> 16:34.699
-Hey.
-JESSE: Hey, where are you?

16:34.732 --> 16:36.603
I've been stalling,
my parents are getting hungry.

16:36.636 --> 16:38.707
Shit.
No. Uh, um, I'm sorry.

16:38.740 --> 16:42.113
No.
I totally spaced. We...

16:42.146 --> 16:44.251
We're prepping for a service.

16:44.284 --> 16:47.324
Um... I'm leaving now, okay?

16:47.357 --> 16:48.727
I'll be... I'll be home in ten.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.031
All right, see you soon.

16:53.202 --> 16:55.173
Hey, I... I got to go.

16:55.206 --> 16:57.243
Um, Jesse's parents just
flew in from Cincinnati.

16:57.276 --> 16:59.716
-I just totally spaced.
-Don't worry about it.

16:59.749 --> 17:02.521
I can finish up here.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.726
Thank you.

17:04.759 --> 17:06.696
Oh, wait.

17:09.434 --> 17:11.438
You wanted to, uh,

17:11.471 --> 17:14.043
tell me something.

17:14.845 --> 17:16.850
I'll, um...

17:16.883 --> 17:19.120
I'll tell you later.

17:22.761 --> 17:24.798
(door closes)

17:26.134 --> 17:28.472
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.242
How was the flight?

17:35.486 --> 17:37.524
(switch clicking)

17:40.429 --> 17:42.466
(glass breaking)

17:57.263 --> 17:59.233
(soft crunching)

18:00.670 --> 18:02.173
(woman screams)

18:04.411 --> 18:08.152
-(banging)
-(woman shrieks)

18:08.185 --> 18:10.791
(woman whimpering)

18:10.824 --> 18:12.293
(man grunts)

18:12.326 --> 18:15.400
No! No! No!

18:15.433 --> 18:17.672
(woman whimpering)

18:17.705 --> 18:18.740
GIRL:
Mama?

18:24.652 --> 18:26.722
It's okay, Mama.

18:27.725 --> 18:30.664
-(crying)
-It's-it's okay.

18:30.697 --> 18:33.402
-It's okay. It's okay.
-(crying)

18:33.435 --> 18:35.874
-It's okay. What is it?
-(crying)

18:37.845 --> 18:39.381
What is it?

18:39.414 --> 18:40.651
(crying)

18:40.684 --> 18:42.688
Uh, you always got a box
of these stashed,

18:42.721 --> 18:43.957
so I thought it'd be romantic.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.393
-Hey.
-(crying)

18:45.426 --> 18:47.463
Give us a minute.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.338
Hey, come here.

18:51.371 --> 18:54.311
What is it? Talk to me.

18:54.344 --> 18:57.718
It's, um...
it's-it's my-my mom.

18:57.751 --> 18:59.254
-Yeah?
-She was murdered.

18:59.287 --> 19:00.758
A man broke in
and bashed her head

19:00.791 --> 19:04.431
and there was blood
all over the kitchen, and...

19:04.464 --> 19:06.970
-these were her favorite.
-It's all right. It's all right.

19:07.003 --> 19:09.241
I always kept a box.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.378
It made me feel close to her.

19:11.411 --> 19:15.253
(sighs, whimpers)

19:15.286 --> 19:17.625
You see,

19:17.658 --> 19:19.495
I'm-I'm completely messed up.

19:19.528 --> 19:21.465
You don't-you don't
want to marry me.

19:21.499 --> 19:23.603
-Of course I want to marry you.
-Oh, well, you're so sweet, and

19:23.636 --> 19:26.341
you d-you deserve a nice,
a nice, normal girl.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.279
-I'm not that person.
-No, no, no, no, no.

19:28.312 --> 19:29.749
-Don't do this.
-I-I can't... I can't be

19:29.782 --> 19:31.519
-what you want me to be.
-Don't do this. Honey.

19:31.552 --> 19:33.657
-Sam. Please.
-No. I'm sorry. (cries)

19:33.690 --> 19:35.727
(door opens, closes)

19:45.680 --> 19:47.784
(sighs)

19:49.655 --> 19:51.626
Hi, John.

19:51.659 --> 19:53.429
I'm Sam.

19:53.462 --> 19:55.701
I will be taking care
of you today.

19:55.734 --> 19:57.805
(sighs)

19:57.838 --> 20:00.275
OD. 26.

20:01.746 --> 20:03.783
So young.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.563
I hope you made the most
of your time.

20:29.334 --> 20:30.937
No...

20:34.745 --> 20:36.850
Goddamn it.
You're so stupid.

20:36.883 --> 20:38.719
(cries)

21:04.370 --> 21:06.341
You were the only one.

21:06.374 --> 21:08.378
(sniffles)

21:09.447 --> 21:11.485
The only one who understood
what it was like

21:11.519 --> 21:13.589
to walk around with this...

21:15.459 --> 21:18.666
...this pit of darkness inside.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.918
You saw it in me.

21:33.930 --> 21:35.934
And it didn't scare you.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.679
I scare everyone.

21:44.484 --> 21:46.522
Even myself.

21:53.569 --> 21:56.107
You made me feel
like I wasn't alone anymore.

22:00.182 --> 22:02.420
God, I just...

22:02.453 --> 22:04.658
I've been alone for so long.

22:09.568 --> 22:11.639
(sniffles)

22:18.886 --> 22:20.924

(exhales)

25:48.205 --> 25:50.777
You're alive.

25:55.219 --> 25:57.289
Fuck you.

25:58.693 --> 26:00.162
I'm sorry.

26:00.195 --> 26:01.966
Look, I screwed up.

26:01.999 --> 26:03.803
-I screwed up.
-Don't fucking touch me, okay?

26:03.836 --> 26:05.907
-What the fuck was that,
some sort of sick prank?
-No.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.176
It was never supposed
to go that far.

26:07.209 --> 26:09.047
I know
what a dead body looks like.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.784
You weren't fucking breathing.

26:10.817 --> 26:12.320
You can find a pill online
for anything these days.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.990
Your chest was cut open.

26:14.023 --> 26:16.696
I saw your fucking autopsy scar.

26:16.729 --> 26:18.398
-I have a buddy
who's good with prosthetics.
-Just shut up! Just shut the...

26:18.431 --> 26:20.269
Just shut the fuck up, okay?

26:20.302 --> 26:22.206
I was trying to help you.

26:22.239 --> 26:24.243
(chuckling softly)

26:25.880 --> 26:27.350
You're fucking deranged.

26:27.383 --> 26:29.120
I'm fucking deranged?
I'm fucking deranged?

26:29.153 --> 26:30.690
Listen.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.226
You can call me
whatever you want.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.965
But it won't change
the fact that you fucked me.

26:40.275 --> 26:42.312
And you liked that I was dead.

26:47.724 --> 26:49.794
Get the fuck off me.

26:50.763 --> 26:52.166
Okay, you're scared.

26:52.199 --> 26:53.402
I'm scared, too.

26:53.435 --> 26:56.308
Don't you see?

26:56.341 --> 26:58.412
Sam, Sam, there's no normal,

26:58.445 --> 27:00.382
there's no normal for me or you.

27:00.415 --> 27:01.752
This is who we are.

27:01.785 --> 27:03.856
No, that's not me, okay?
You're wrong.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.060
You're fucking,
you're fucking wrong.

27:15.012 --> 27:17.250
Our new volumizing
waterproof mascara

27:17.283 --> 27:19.086
is a miracle.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.763
It goes on light, you can cry,

27:23.796 --> 27:25.967
dance in the rain, go wild

27:26.000 --> 27:29.007
with your water aerobics and
you'll stay fresh as a daisy.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.877
No smudge, no raccoon eyes.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.781
Do I look
like I do water aerobics?

27:32.814 --> 27:34.250
We can try a more subtle lip.

27:34.283 --> 27:36.354
Um, this Faberge Femme is
a fan favorite.

27:38.793 --> 27:41.131
-You guys really
didn't have to do this.
-Of course we did!

27:41.164 --> 27:43.135
Our little Sammy's
getting married.

27:43.168 --> 27:44.404
-Go, Jesse, go!
-Finally.

27:44.437 --> 27:46.274
-(whoops)
-Yeah!

27:46.307 --> 27:47.878
All right,
who's ready for shots?

27:47.911 --> 27:49.280
(whooping)

27:49.313 --> 27:50.750
-To Jess.
-Thank you, thank you,

27:50.783 --> 27:52.186
thank you, thank you,
thank you...

27:52.219 --> 27:54.190
-To Sammy.
-Sammy!

27:54.223 --> 27:55.927
Getting hitched!

27:55.960 --> 27:57.997
We're meeting
the wedding planner now.

27:58.966 --> 28:00.402
I promise I'll mention it, okay?

28:00.435 --> 28:02.039
Call you later.

28:02.072 --> 28:03.976
(car horn blares)

28:05.379 --> 28:07.350
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:07.383 --> 28:09.487
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm just...

28:09.521 --> 28:11.792
just daydreaming
about our wedding.

28:11.825 --> 28:13.896
-Oh. All right.
-You know?

28:13.929 --> 28:15.299
You look so good.

28:15.332 --> 28:16.869
(both chuckle)

28:16.902 --> 28:18.906
(panting)

28:21.845 --> 28:23.916
(grunts)
Fuck.

28:31.064 --> 28:33.235
(sighs)

28:33.268 --> 28:35.272
I love you, babe.

28:37.109 --> 28:39.013
I can't wait
to make you my wife.

28:40.415 --> 28:42.119
Me, too.

28:42.152 --> 28:43.956
(bell tolling)

28:43.989 --> 28:46.294
DANI:
You look beautiful.

28:49.133 --> 28:53.007
I have never seen
a sadder bride.

28:54.143 --> 28:55.513
What's going on with you?

28:55.546 --> 28:57.216
I'm... (clears throat)
I'm fine.

28:57.249 --> 28:59.053
It's just... jitters.

28:59.086 --> 29:02.192
You've been acting weird
ever since you quit your job.

29:03.361 --> 29:06.468
It's like the lizard people
invaded your body,

29:06.502 --> 29:08.372
and now you're this girl
who likes pastels

29:08.405 --> 29:10.275
and afternoon tea.

29:10.308 --> 29:12.113
Where's my friend
with the rocking hair

29:12.146 --> 29:13.382
who liked
to talk to dead people?

29:13.415 --> 29:14.985
Okay, that's not funny.

29:15.018 --> 29:17.356
I'm not joking.

29:18.425 --> 29:21.097
Are you sure you want
to do this?

29:21.130 --> 29:23.368
Jesse's a great guy, but...

29:23.401 --> 29:25.205
does he make you happy?

29:26.274 --> 29:28.444
Of course he makes me happy.
I...

29:30.282 --> 29:33.021
Look, this is, this is

I just want a boring,
regular life.

We are gathered here today
to join this man

29:45.445 --> 29:48.385
and this woman
in holy matrimony.

29:48.418 --> 29:50.155
Jesse and Samantha

29:50.188 --> 29:52.527
have prepared their own vows

29:52.560 --> 29:54.498
to express their love.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.535
Samantha?

29:58.271 --> 30:00.275
Thank you.

(chuckles)

30:05.920 --> 30:08.258
Growing up, I...

30:08.291 --> 30:10.295
didn't really have a family.

30:11.598 --> 30:14.170
And that was okay. I...

30:14.203 --> 30:16.374
learned to get through life
without one.

30:17.342 --> 30:19.313

-throwing back a Stella...

I was dead.
