<i>My enemy's grandchildren.</i>

14:02.925 --> 14:05.194
<i>This is so disgusting!</i>

14:07.335 --> 14:09.336
Who are you, mister?

14:09.605 --> 14:11.335
He looks like a policeman.

14:11.335 --> 14:14.674
Why is a policeman here?
We didn't report anything.

14:14.674 --> 14:17.475
Grandfather said not to report to the police.

14:17.475 --> 14:20.274
Sis, looks like this mister is a bad guy!

14:44.033 --> 14:46.302
A bit late to introduce myself.

14:46.433 --> 14:50.972
I am a government employee from Chuncheon
who responsible for registration.

14:50.972 --> 14:52.973

14:52.973 --> 14:55.383

arthritis and suffering from diabetes.

15:04.722 --> 15:07.391
And you guys are going
to move from here, right?

15:07.391 --> 15:08.862
How do you know that?

15:08.862 --> 15:12.862
This house... down payment is 100 thousand Won
and monthly rent is 20 thousand Won.

15:12.862 --> 15:15.131
But this village is included in the area
that going to be developed.

15:15.131 --> 15:18.872
Because land registration,
implementation of Compensation Law Clause 54,

15:18.872 --> 15:21.542
have to vacant the land
the latest by October.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.271
And that's why, I'm here
today to meet your grandfather.

15:23.271 --> 15:25.140
I know your grandfather very well.

15:25.140 --> 15:27.141
Dong Yi, you got 100 in 3 test.

15:27.141 --> 15:29.412
How proud he is of you.

15:30.341 --> 15:31.950
Now, you understand right?

15:31.950 --> 15:34.481
My reading & listening test also got 100 mark.

15:34.481 --> 15:36.480
<i>What's up with this kid?</i>

15:36.620 --> 15:41.150
Anyway, there's a chance I can help
you to find your Grandfather.

15:42.891 --> 15:44.760
Help us to find Grandfather?

15:44.760 --> 15:46.359
I can find him in 1 hour.

15:47.430 --> 15:50.900
But both of you need to come with me.

15:51.300 --> 15:55.439
Grandfather told us to stay here.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.440
Then, I'll come back later.

15:57.841 --> 16:00.909
Didn't you said you want to help
us to find Grandfather?

16:02.779 --> 16:04.640
<i>You'd never understand,
even in your dreams.</i>

16:05.450 --> 16:07.979
<i>why I need both of you.</i>

16:17.988 --> 16:20.129
<i>If the direction just now is correct...
One of the three.</i>

It's 200 Won but
because you're handsome,

19:06.551 --> 19:08.151
- just pay 100 Won.
- Keep the change.

19:09.620 --> 19:12.421
Is there anyone who keep cows?

19:18.961 --> 19:21.900
<i>The footsteps, straw from the barn.</i>

So what?

19:38.719 --> 19:39.918
Do you have proof? Proof!

19:39.918 --> 19:41.249
Where do you park the car?

19:41.249 --> 19:43.650
The car key is with you now, right?

19:45.919 --> 19:47.389
So what?

19:48.458 --> 19:49.929
You seems to know something.

19:49.929 --> 19:51.390
Did Chief know about you here?

19:51.390 --> 19:52.459
<i>So it's the police.</i>

19:52.459 --> 19:53.798
Don't talk nonsense.

19:53.798 --> 19:55.128
I didn't do anything.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.728
I'm not accusing.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.740
Tonite, at 7:08pm,

19:58.740 --> 20:00.869
You, Kim Jin Ho and your friend, Choi Dae Jeon,

20:00.869 --> 20:03.808
Driving a car with registration no. "Gangwon 5-7102"
and kidnapped Kim Byeong Deok.

20:03.808 --> 20:05.008
Then, passed him to you the man you called
Chief and receive some money.

20:05.008 --> 20:10.748
After that you went for a drink, due to the coldness
and tired, you went home with the car.

20:11.147 --> 20:13.678
Jin Ho, did you forgot me?

20:13.678 --> 20:16.087
I'm the one blacking the road,
and changing the tires.

20:16.087 --> 20:19.557
Don't you know why I was there,
on the middle of the night?

20:19.687 --> 20:21.958
Of course I was monitoring you.

20:21.958 --> 20:24.887
That Chief is someone
we've been tracking from the start.

20:24.887 --> 20:26.227
If you talk nonsense one more time,

20:26.227 --> 20:28.228
I wont be asking politely anymore.

20:28.358 --> 20:30.097
Think before you answer!

20:30.097 --> 20:32.497
Who do you think you're lying to?

20:32.637 --> 20:34.496
M--Me... I just responsible to
drive the car.

20:34.496 --> 20:36.907
That Chief will call you now.

20:36.907 --> 20:38.777
When you answer the call, a few second later,
the connection will cut-off.

20:38.777 --> 20:41.176
You just have to tell me
where the car is.

20:49.846 --> 20:51.716
=Where is the car?=

20:51.716 --> 20:53.717
The place where we met yesterday.

20:53.717 --> 20:56.125
=Come out & give the key to me!=

20:57.325 --> 20:58.655
Where is the place?

20:58.655 --> 21:02.396
That... That place...

21:02.396 --> 21:03.995
When you walk out of here, walk back--

21:03.995 --> 21:05.865
Mr Registration!

21:06.535 --> 21:07.865
Found him.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.466
Did you found Grandfather?

21:13.605 --> 21:14.275
What are you doing?

21:14.275 --> 21:17.205
Ah, this man must be
from the registration department too.

21:17.205 --> 21:20.545
<i>I'm Kim Mal soon, my grandfather...</i>

21:20.545 --> 21:21.075
What is this?

21:22.015 --> 21:23.745
Are you really a policeman?

21:23.745 --> 21:25.485
I thought so.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.284
Who're you?

21:26.284 --> 21:28.413
First, tell me where is that place!

21:28.413 --> 21:28.954
Get out!

21:29.355 --> 21:32.555
Get out of here if you
dont want to be dead!

21:32.555 --> 21:34.824
<i>Still dont want to get out?</i>

21:38.695 --> 21:42.834
Mister, why are you lying?
He said you're a policeman.

21:44.033 --> 21:45.904
Sis, this mister is weird.

21:45.904 --> 21:46.834
Mal Soon.

21:46.834 --> 21:48.704
Why did you bring this?

21:49.104 --> 21:51.243
What if someone steals this?

21:51.243 --> 21:52.713
This is Grandfather precious possession.

21:52.713 --> 21:54.573
<i>I nearly got the answer.</i>

21:54.573 --> 21:56.983
<i>Because of these two.
Better just tied & throw them in the car trunk.</i>

21:56.983 --> 21:58.183
<i>Sis...</i>

21:58.183 --> 22:00.852
<i>These are what left.
Must now lose these too.</i>

22:04.853 --> 22:06.723
Can't we come too?

22:06.723 --> 22:07.922
Lets go together.

22:08.863 --> 22:11.392
<i>Damn these reckless kids.</i>

22:11.392 --> 22:13.262
<i>We'll talk about this later.</i>

22:17.533 --> 22:19.802
<i>Police is not investigating the case,
but they're kidnapping.</i>

22:20.472 --> 22:22.341
<i>Not killing but kidnapping secretly.</i>

22:22.341 --> 22:24.473
<i>There's no personal  grudge,
so this is not a revenge.</i>

22:25.003 --> 22:28.342
<i>Cannot be sold,
and cannot bring in money.</i>

22:28.611 --> 22:30.211
<i>Kidnnaping old man like this
is not for money.</i>

22:32.083 --> 22:34.082
<i>May be because this oldman
know something,</i>

22:34.352 --> 22:35.682
<i>or has something.</i>

22:50.231 --> 22:51.701
There's someone came looking.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.780
<i>For what?</i>

22:54.630 --> 22:57.301
Don't now.
Asking this & that.

22:57.301 --> 22:58.770
But I've forcefully send him away.

22:58.770 --> 23:03.580
<i>Mister! Mister! Mister! Mister!</i>

23:03.580 --> 23:05.310
<i>What is that sound?</i>

23:05.310 --> 23:06.650
<i>Did you walked here?</i>

23:06.650 --> 23:07.850
Yes, why?

23:23.999 --> 23:25.468
Ah, damn it!

23:26.670 --> 23:30.539
<i>Where are you, Mister?</i>

23:31.739 --> 23:33.468
<i>He got away from me just like that.</i>

23:33.738 --> 23:36.009
<i>Kim Byeong Deok, I'll catch you.</i>

23:36.409 --> 23:38.138
<i>With my own hand...</i>

23:38.138 --> 23:39.748
<i>Milk candy.</i>

23:40.948 --> 23:42.419
<i>Did it fall when I was running?</i>

23:44.419 --> 23:47.088
<i>Why is nothing going smoothly?
I've no money.</i>

23:48.687 --> 23:53.228
Mister, where are we going?

23:58.968 --> 24:01.497
Is Granfather doing fine?

24:01.497 --> 24:02.168
Hey!

24:02.698 --> 24:03.498
Yes?

24:03.498 --> 24:05.238
Too noisy!

24:15.377 --> 24:16.717
Wait a minute!

24:18.316 --> 24:19.646
Is that money?

24:24.856 --> 24:26.326
What is this feeling?

24:32.996 --> 24:34.995
Welcome. Welcome.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.136
It need to have a phone.
Largest room.

24:37.136 --> 24:39.936
What did I said, there's sonnim coming.
<font color="#ffff00">[Sonnim - customer]</font>

24:40.335 --> 24:42.735
No wonder the magpies keep chirping.

24:44.205 --> 24:47.004
Total is 8 500 Won.

24:57.155 --> 25:00.755
<i>A shabby second-hand furniture shop.
Just opened a few days.</i>

25:00.755 --> 25:01.955
Because we just open the shop,
I give you 1000 Won discount.

25:01.955 --> 25:05.155
<i>Tattoo was removed, he want to forget old times as a gang member...</i>

25:05.155 --> 25:06.225
7... 7 thousand.

25:06.225 --> 25:08.225
<i>... he's a bit stupid.</i>

25:08.225 --> 25:10.094
The balance is 1000, right?

25:10.094 --> 25:13.703
Aigoo, you're so cute like a small pet.

25:13.703 --> 25:14.905
Wait a minute.

25:16.504 --> 25:25.444
Actually, I bought this to stop smoking,
but I'll give this to you.

25:25.444 --> 25:27.843
Your daughter... nieces, right?

25:27.843 --> 25:31.713
No, this mister said my Grandfather
captured by the bad guy.

25:34.923 --> 25:37.453
Say thank you to uncle.
Good girl.

25:40.663 --> 25:41.863
<i>What is he saying?</i>

25:45.462 --> 25:46.403
I'm a geumsa.
[Geumsa - public prosecutor]

25:47.202 --> 25:49.732
These few days, I've a job to
protect the victim's family.

25:49.732 --> 25:52.003
I thought geumsa shouldn't been doing this

25:52.003 --> 25:53.603
but due to some pity involved,

25:54.543 --> 25:56.672
I'm the new kid,
so I just follow orders.

25:56.672 --> 25:58.811
Anyway, just pretend that you dont know.

25:59.882 --> 26:02.282
Oh, Geumsa.

26:02.282 --> 26:04.012
Kids, lets go up!

26:04.012 --> 26:06.151
Grandfather's kidnapped.

26:08.281 --> 26:09.352
You're a geumsa?

26:17.632 --> 26:19.901
Forget Wolgil-ri, Gudam-ri.

26:19.901 --> 26:22.830
He didn't even blink when he lie.

26:23.631 --> 26:25.641
What is his actual job?

26:25.641 --> 26:28.301
Mister, you've not sleep since yesterday.

26:28.301 --> 26:29.241
<i>Better you sleep first.</i>

26:29.241 --> 26:31.640
Hello, may I speak to Tae Jeong?

26:31.640 --> 26:34.040
=Tae Jeong? Who?=

26:36.451 --> 26:38.850
Hello, may I speak to Tae Jeong?

26:38.850 --> 26:40.981
=Choi Tae Jeong? There's nobody by that name.=

26:40.981 --> 26:42.050
Ah, it's you? You...

26:42.050 --> 26:44.590
Erm, is the prosecutor in there...?

26:45.120 --> 26:46.990
There's something I want to talk to you.

26:46.990 --> 26:47.920
I'm a bit busy currently.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.530
Sorry for disturbing you.

26:49.929 --> 26:52.199
I'm a bit impatient.

26:52.599 --> 26:56.330
In other words, I used to involve
in the world of fighting.

26:56.330 --> 26:59.669
Of course, now I'm back on the
right track.

26:59.669 --> 27:01.668
<i>Now, I'd never, never involve.</i>

27:01.668 --> 27:05.679
But .. My inn is newly opened,

27:05.679 --> 27:08.878
honestly...

27:08.878 --> 27:10.478
- Those scumbags surely need to be dead.

27:10.478 --> 27:11.480
- Those scumbags surely need to be dead.
- Sis, I brought notebook too.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.120
Sis, I brought notebook too.

27:12.219 --> 27:13.019
<i>Good..</i>

27:13.019 --> 27:13.419
<i>I want to write like you too.</i>

27:13.419 --> 27:14.619
<i>- I want to write like you too.
- However, there's a building nearby.

27:14.619 --> 27:17.548
However, there's a building nearby.

27:17.548 --> 27:18.347

Don't just walk on your own.

28:42.035 --> 28:43.235
Hey you both, come here!

28:43.235 --> 28:44.165
What's up?

28:46.575 --> 28:49.773
Hey, are you really want to find
you Grandfather or not?

28:49.773 --> 28:51.105
Of course!

28:54.044 --> 28:56.584
If you continue being like this,
it'd be hard to find him.

28:56.983 --> 29:00.455
If you're not going to help,
dont be an obstacle.

29:00.455 --> 29:02.323
You lied everyday.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.924
This is the way to do it.

29:03.924 --> 29:06.053
If you don't understand,
can you just shut up?

29:09.264 --> 29:10.994
if you want to live longer,

29:10.994 --> 29:12.063
be careful of what you say!

29:22.472 --> 29:23.943
<i>That give me goosebumps.</i>

29:46.632 --> 29:48.232
<i>7:40pm.</i>

29:53.301 --> 29:54.902
<i>Still here?</i>

30:01.841 --> 30:05.441
=From 80's until now,

30:08.380 --> 30:10.121
There's no people working today.

30:10.121 --> 30:13.720
Lately, you can count with your finger,
the youngster that would stand a beating.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.720
<i>Pessimist is the type that I hate.</i>

30:16.260 --> 30:17.590
<i>This place should be close down faster.</i>

<i>I had enough of this all.</i>

30:18.920 --> 30:20.531
<i>Still can live without this place.</i>

30:20.531 --> 30:22.260
<i>The 24th.</i>

30:24.000 --> 30:26.270

30:28.929 --> 30:30.799

30:33.609 --> 30:35.070
<i>Why it has to be at night?</i>

30:35.609 --> 30:38.279
But looks like you're not from around here, aren't ya?

30:38.279 --> 30:39.879
How do you know the gorvernor is coming?

30:39.879 --> 30:41.610
Heard it somewhere.

30:44.949 --> 30:48.149
Around 10 minutes ago

30:49.889 --> 30:51.359

30:51.359 --> 30:52.959
Could I see the invoice?

30:56.159 --> 30:58.029
I'm representing the claim department
from the insurance company.

30:58.029 --> 30:59.228
<i>He is actually...</i>

31:00.828 --> 31:04.438
He is a detective, from class super.

31:04.838 --> 31:06.038
Class super? What is that?

31:06.038 --> 31:08.168
Just  a detektif, but higher class.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.517
Just shut up!

31:17.517 --> 31:19.388
Why? Didn't you said supposed to be like this?

31:19.388 --> 31:21.247
I'm trying to help you.

31:23.918 --> 31:25.517
<i>Aigoo, so cute.</i>

31:26.327 --> 31:28.727
Actually, I'm a policeman.

31:29.127 --> 31:31.126
Hope you can give the contact info
of the owner of the car no. 7102.

31:31.126 --> 31:32.056

31:32.056 --> 31:35.527
Our Grandfather is kidnapped by the bad guys.

31:35.527 --> 31:36.996
This Mr.Policeman is helping up
to look for him.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.467
You can't say it like that.

31:38.467 --> 31:40.466
He asked us not to say it
that way, didn't he?

31:40.466 --> 31:42.337
Oh, right.

31:43.407 --> 31:44.607
These kids' grandfather kidnapped?

31:44.607 --> 31:45.137
Yes.

31:45.137 --> 31:45.807
Their grandfather?

31:45.807 --> 31:46.476
Yes.

31:46.476 --> 31:47.546
Then, the car's owner is the criminal?

31:47.546 --> 31:49.545
Yes, so hurry up & give
me the contact info of the car's owner.

31:49.545 --> 31:50.617

31:53.546 --> 31:57.015
Mister, how you find
the criminal this fast?

31:57.015 --> 31:59.016
You're awesome.

31:59.687 --> 32:01.026
Right, Mal Soon?

32:01.026 --> 32:02.496
Awesome, yeah you're awesome.

32:02.496 --> 32:04.095
But there's always something fishy.

32:08.626 --> 32:12.365
Do you think I'm a good guy?

32:12.365 --> 32:13.164
Yes.

32:13.164 --> 32:16.504
Your guessed is wrong!
Totally.

32:17.576 --> 32:20.245
For the last time, I'm reminding you,

32:20.774 --> 32:22.515
If you try to get butt in again,

32:22.515 --> 32:23.444
then, I'd--

32:23.444 --> 32:25.444
Are you really Registration Department employee?

32:26.114 --> 32:30.654
It--It's true.
That is really true.

32:30.915 --> 32:34.523
Please don't go around talking nonsense.

32:34.523 --> 32:37.724
But may be, all those people can
help us later.

32:37.724 --> 32:39.994
Impossible, so shut your mouth!

32:39.994 --> 32:43.463
Here...
Just now, you keep looking at these.

32:43.463 --> 32:45.335
You want some?

32:54.674 --> 32:58.673
Aigoo, seriously!
Wait here!

32:58.673 --> 32:59.883
What's in the bag?

32:59.883 --> 33:01.483
There's nothing.

33:08.023 --> 33:09.752
<i>You can't communicate with those kids.</i>

33:10.152 --> 33:12.962
<i>I should let them know
the taste of fear.</i>

34:20.759 --> 34:22.217
<i>Where's Kim Byeong Deok?</i>

34:23.027 --> 34:25.688
Hwacheon police division,
Team Force 1, Det. Kang Seong Il.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.958
Even though I don't know what
you guys are doing,

34:27.958 --> 34:30.768
just let me have Kim Byeong Deok

34:30.768 --> 34:32.899
and I'd generously
pretend I know nothing about this.

34:32.899 --> 34:33.969
<i>On normal days,</i>

34:33.969 --> 34:35.969
<i>I'd have teach some lesson to you guys.</i>

34:35.969 --> 34:38.367
<i>Due to some personal problem that need to attend.</i>

34:39.706 --> 34:41.839
But why are there so many
papers here?

34:41.978 --> 34:43.578
Why are you looking for Kim Byeong Deok?

34:43.978 --> 34:45.978
What are you saying, idiot.

34:46.246 --> 34:47.317
That's not your business.

34:47.317 --> 34:50.117
You... Are you Hong Gil Dong?

34:54.117 --> 34:58.127
Looking for Kim Byeong Deok to get even?

35:00.127 --> 35:00.797
Who're you?

35:00.797 --> 35:03.067
News is saying, that you can't
remember about the past.

35:04.127 --> 35:06.267
But the face of that old man
you didn't forget.

35:06.937 --> 35:09.867
Right, how can one forget
that incident?

35:12.407 --> 35:13.607
What are try to do?

35:13.607 --> 35:14.407
Don't move!

35:14.407 --> 35:16.006
If you wanna shoot,
aim it right at me.

35:37.626 --> 35:39.496
Try to guess, from where
do I know about you.

35:46.305 --> 35:49.104
If you able to get out of here alive,
think carefully.

35:49.644 --> 35:54.315
"Where is that old man?"
"Who are you really?"

36:37.422 --> 36:39.153
Who are you?

37:35.610 --> 37:37.479
<i>Run, Hong Gil Dong!</i>

37:37.740 --> 37:41.479
<i>You have to live.
Live and avenge me.</i>

37:48.290 --> 37:51.890
Mister, put this plaster on the wound!
Apply this first.

37:59.768 --> 38:01.369
<i>What pill is he taking?</i>

38:02.170 --> 38:03.500
Mister...

38:07.108 --> 38:09.238
<i>He knows me in one glance.</i>

38:09.779 --> 38:11.109
<i>He knew me.</i>

38:11.509 --> 38:16.318
Did you asked the bad guy
about my grandfather?

38:17.919 --> 38:20.049
<i>To the reason I'm here</i>

38:21.118 --> 38:24.718
<i>how that bastard knows everything?</i>

38:33.797 --> 38:35.268
Search all hotels!

38:35.527 --> 38:36.997
The kids are with him.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.197
Bring them here!

38:38.197 --> 38:38.867
Yes.

38:39.267 --> 38:41.938
Yeonggam, Hong Gil Dong is coming.
<font color="#ffff00">[Yeonggam - old man]</font>

38:44.207 --> 38:47.407
Someone who you can't even see his shadow,
but now...

38:48.346 --> 38:50.217
Yeonggam whose life
is now meaningless...

38:50.217 --> 38:51.947
So why now?

38:52.616 --> 38:54.747
Working to ruin my plan?

38:55.287 --> 38:58.617
Ah, Dong Yi dan Mal Soon...

38:58.617 --> 39:03.027
Children...
The children is not what import now.

39:04.757 --> 39:06.226
Wasn't it because of your obsession

39:06.226 --> 39:07.966
you're here.

39:08.626 --> 39:11.035
Why still hiding that fact ?

39:11.435 --> 39:12.906
It make me sad.

39:13.566 --> 39:18.235
Humans are so carefree,
that's why they do bad things.

39:19.175 --> 39:20.246
Like you did.

39:21.046 --> 39:23.576
After this problem is settle,
a new world will be born.

39:23.576 --> 39:25.315
It will be just like I want it.

39:25.845 --> 39:26.915
Where is the financial report?

39:26.915 --> 39:28.784
If you let me go
with the children,

whether I was here or not.</i>

42:25.086 --> 42:26.687
He was here yeaterday.

42:26.687 --> 42:32.026
<i>Tell him that I was here.
And I'll be back tonight.</i>

42:34.427 --> 42:35.756
{\i1Aa--Alright.

42:36.296 --> 42:38.296
Last night he was here...

42:38.296 --> 42:44.166
I don't know whether he'll be back.
He should be...

42:47.775 --> 42:50.306
I'm out of money.
Send some to me!

42:51.106 --> 42:54.975
It'd be difficult.
Nobody could go there.

42:55.915 --> 42:57.786
Everyone's out doing some research.

42:57.786 --> 42:59.516
Soon, I need to go to the airport.

42:59.516 --> 43:02.055
=Furthermore, it's clear I can't
send it to some random place.=

43:02.055 --> 43:04.325
I got 10 Won only!

43:04.325 --> 43:06.055
<i>You should me that earlier.</i>

43:06.055 --> 43:07.395
=How can I know from the start.=

43:08.055 --> 43:09.255
I'm dead busy.

43:09.255 --> 43:12.325
The car with registration 7102
owner is Kang Seong Il.

43:12.325 --> 43:13.395
I know.

43:16.465 --> 43:21.135
Now, you want me to give double
the money for the bribe...

43:21.135 --> 43:22.734
=it's not as easy as it seems to get the contract.=

43:22.734 --> 43:24.605
=I don't have time to re-do it.=

43:24.605 --> 43:26.074
=You think we're a family of masters?=

43:26.074 --> 43:27.815
=How about the movie?=

43:27.815 --> 43:29.414
=Didn't you said you just going for a day?
Why aren't you home yet?=

43:29.414 --> 43:30.344
Whatever!

43:30.344 --> 43:33.414
Just send the money over if there's someone available.

43:39.024 --> 43:41.153
<i>Nothing's helping!
Damn it!</i>

43:56.233 --> 43:58.102
<i>It's still can be eaten after washing it.</i>

44:02.913 --> 44:05.312
Now, how can we find Grandfather?

44:07.452 --> 44:08.652
<i>With this face, how...</i>

44:08.652 --> 44:11.452
I gave it a thought.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.721
Possibly, those bad guys

44:13.721 --> 44:17.061
<i>locked Grandfather in an abondened building?</i>

44:17.061 --> 44:19.992
In Yongdam-ri over there
there's a lot of that kind of building.

44:19.992 --> 44:21.731
The onwer rarely come over.

44:21.731 --> 44:22.662
We can look for that kinda place.

44:22.662 --> 44:25.601
No need to look.
I know where it is.

44:25.601 --> 44:26.400
You knew?

44:26.400 --> 44:28.131
You knew it? Seriously?

44:28.131 --> 44:32.141
Anyway, it's not in Yongdam-ri.
But in a building without an owner.

44:32.401 --> 44:34.270
<i>How do he knows?
So awesome.</i>

44:34.270 --> 44:35.610
<i>Yeah, so cool.</i>

44:44.819 --> 44:47.221
However, we need to stop somewhere first,
before going to that place.

44:49.490 --> 44:51.090
Dong Yi, Mal Soon.

44:52.159 --> 44:53.890
Can you help me with something?

44:53.890 --> 44:55.761
Yes, we'll do it!

44:55.761 --> 44:57.760
How can we help you?

44:57.760 --> 45:00.169
<i>You just need to say a few words.
Just like tell you.</i>

45:00.169 --> 45:01.770
<i>Don't say anything unnecessary.</i>

45:01.770 --> 45:03.239
<i>Aren't you saying
useless thing?</i>

45:03.900 --> 45:07.639
<i>That day, Kang Seong Il departed
at 06:17am.</i>

45:07.909 --> 45:10.309
<i>At the same time,
Kim Byeong Deok arrived at the workshop.</i>

45:10.309 --> 45:13.649
<i>Needed time is 50 minutes.
With speed 70 km/hour in 20 minutes journey...</i>

45:13.649 --> 45:16.719
<i>The distance from Dong Yi's house is 9 km.
And distance from the workshop is 3 km...</i>

45:17.249 --> 45:18.718
<i>Kim Byeong Deok is here..</i>

45:18.718 --> 45:21.118
Around this area,
is there any vacant house?

45:21.789 --> 45:23.118
<i>It's near the workshop.</i>

45:24.060 --> 45:26.189
Around this area, there's a vacant building.

45:26.458 --> 45:29.528
ut excuse me...
who're you?

45:29.528 --> 45:33.399
Just now, I heard your story.
But I'm still not understand.

45:33.399 --> 45:34.328
Your face...

45:34.328 --> 45:39.939
He is from District Government Office,
Department of Planning and Land Construction,
Assist. Manager Jeong Myeong Soo.
<font color="#ffff00"></font>

45:39.939 --> 45:46.077
We're now...
doing the survey about the land population.

45:46.077 --> 45:49.408
For this month, all the employees from District Government Office

45:49.408 --> 45:50.348
will be doing that.

45:50.348 --> 45:52.217
But I'm going to be in first grade this year.

45:52.217 --> 45:54.617
I was just tag along with my sister.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.088
Now you know who is him, right?

45:58.088 --> 46:00.627
Looks like you know who am I now.

46:03.297 --> 46:05.157
here, drink up!

46:06.226 --> 46:07.167
Thank you!

46:09.697 --> 46:10.767
How old are you?

46:10.767 --> 46:11.697
8 years old.

46:11.697 --> 46:14.236
Already 8 years old?
Then in what grade are you?

46:14.636 --> 46:15.436
Grade 5.

46:15.436 --> 46:16.507
How is your study? Good?

46:16.507 --> 46:18.507
My grade is not good,
but Big Sis is very smart.

46:19.306 --> 46:22.645
It's okayif you've bad grade.
As long as there's something you wanna do.

46:23.046 --> 46:24.916
I had bad grades too when I was in grade school.

46:24.916 --> 46:25.046
Really bad grades?

46:25.046 --> 46:26.116
Really bad grades?

That building has no owner.
This is the schematic diagram.

46:28.646 --> 46:31.985
That building has no owner.
This is the schematic diagram.

46:32.385 --> 46:34.926
Evenmore, we don't know who built it & when it was build.

46:34.926 --> 46:36.655
I only went there once.

46:36.655 --> 46:39.195
It was not sure whether it was build for people to live or what.

46:39.195 --> 46:40.524
It's suspicious.

46:40.524 --> 46:44.395
We don't even know who owns the land.

46:44.796 --> 46:46.935
<i>A lot of problem & it's weird.</i>

46:48.264 --> 46:49.334
Thank you.

46:49.334 --> 46:50.935
<i>Ah, okay.</i>

46:54.805 --> 46:56.815
<i>What is she writing?</i>

46:57.214 --> 47:02.015
Mister...
What is actually your job?

47:04.554 --> 47:06.414
What is your name, mister?

47:06.414 --> 47:08.823
Kim Mal Soon, if you're
still--

47:08.823 --> 47:10.424
I asked what is your name?

47:12.294 --> 47:13.764
Mister.

47:15.894 --> 47:17.363
Park Doo Chil.

47:17.363 --> 47:20.164
You're lying, right?
Sis, you think so too, right?

47:20.164 --> 47:21.364
What's up with Park Doo Chil.

47:21.364 --> 47:22.833
Let's be honest!

47:23.633 --> 47:26.573
Wait a minute!
Is this the right road?

47:26.573 --> 47:27.503
Why you avoid my question?

47:27.503 --> 47:29.104
Who are you?!

47:29.104 --> 47:30.444
Didn't I said it's Park Doo Cha.

47:30.444 --> 47:31.913
just now you said Park Doo Chil?

47:31.913 --> 47:32.842
Why is it not the same?

47:32.842 --> 47:34.042
You both seriously...

47:34.981 --> 47:36.443
Is this how your grandfather teach you to behave?

47:36.443 --> 47:38.583
Being difficult with adults.

47:38.583 --> 47:42.181
Mal Soon, Mister will not
lie to us.

47:45.392 --> 47:47.522
Is it true your name is Park Doo Cha?

47:47.792 --> 47:49.392
Of course.

47:52.861 --> 47:54.602
Sorry for suspecting you.

47:58.202 --> 48:02.071
Mister, the place that we're going...

48:02.071 --> 48:03.941
...is Grandfather going to be there?

48:22.762 --> 48:28.230
Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather!

48:28.760 --> 48:30.500
<i>Kim Byeong Deok is here.</i>

48:37.039 --> 48:39.841
<i>This time, I'll catch him.</i>

49:26.958 --> 49:28.158
Grandfather!

49:58.446 --> 50:00.455
<i>There's nothing.</i>

50:12.726 --> 50:14.335
<i>It shouldn't be like this.</i>

50:30.075 --> 50:31.944
<i>Dong Yi...</i>

50:33.014 --> 50:35.015
<i>Mal Soon...</i>

51:05.184 --> 51:07.983
Weird, why is it so difficult?

51:15.453 --> 51:21.863
Mister, Grandfather eat delicious food
like us too, right?

51:22.663 --> 51:26.662
Grandfather... did he sleep in warm place?

51:26.662 --> 51:30.942
He's eating good food, getting good sleep.
He's fine.

51:30.942 --> 51:33.342
so don't ask that kind of
question anymore.

51:35.071 --> 51:37.611
Why? Hard to believe it?

51:38.281 --> 51:40.552
No.
I believe it.

51:50.291 --> 51:53.891
I miss Grandfather.

52:01.101 --> 52:05.770
You're being noisy!
Just eat up your jjajangmyeon!

52:24.190 --> 52:26.190
<i>You're eating a lot.
Delicious?</i>

52:26.719 --> 52:28.329
Just eat this up.

52:41.008 --> 52:44.478
Beside your grandfather,
don't you have other relative?

52:45.809 --> 52:46.879
An aunty or something like that.

52:46.879 --> 52:51.017
Nope. Only me, Sis & grandfather.
There's nobody else.

52:53.279 --> 52:56.488
But Sis is so smart,
that she has a lot of friends.

52:56.488 --> 52:58.217
Mister, you have no friends, right?

53:00.627 --> 53:01.429
So what?

53:01.429 --> 53:02.628
Just my instint
saying that you have none.

53:02.628 --> 53:03.428
Mal Soon...

53:03.428 --> 53:07.027
<i>Sis said that you're
a private person.</i>

53:07.027 --> 53:09.168
Do you mind if we become
your friends?

53:16.907 --> 53:17.437
No!

53:17.437 --> 53:18.507
Starting from now on,

53:18.507 --> 53:19.838
... we're friends!

53:20.378 --> 53:24.246
Hey! Why are you touching me like that?

53:24.377 --> 53:27.316
Hey? Why?
Hey! Hey!

53:27.316 --> 53:28.117
Stop it!

53:36.526 --> 53:38.126
Sis, is this on the house?

53:39.326 --> 53:40.927
Mister, you can have it first.

53:43.325 --> 53:44.395
Lets eat together.

53:44.395 --> 53:46.796
Friends should share.

53:47.335 --> 53:48.536
Mal Soon, come here!

53:48.536 --> 53:49.466
Is there something on my face?

53:49.466 --> 53:50.936
Why so messy?

53:52.005 --> 53:54.805
<i>A man like him, it's impossible for him to has friends.</i>

53:56.006 --> 53:57.875
<i>It's difficult for him to
like other people.</i>

53:58.415 --> 54:01.884
Because in his heart,
there's a bruise.

54:03.345 --> 54:06.016
We found them all.
Should we catch them?

54:06.016 --> 54:07.625
Of course.
Why are you still asking?

54:07.625 --> 54:08.685
Catch them all!

54:08.685 --> 54:12.294
Okay, and this is the info about
Gwangeunhwe organization.

54:17.494 --> 54:22.834
<i>Years ago, he saw his mother's death.</i>

54:22.834 --> 54:24.704
<i>Since then, he became
a bit abnormal.</i>

54:24.704 --> 54:26.974
<i>Don't know if it's related to that
or there's something else.</i>

54:26.974 --> 54:28.704
<i>There's a problem with his brain.</i>

54:28.704 --> 54:30.173
<i>It cannot process fear.</i>

54:30.974 --> 54:32.313
<i>In short,</i>

54:32.313 --> 54:34.184
<i>He's fearless.</i>

54:40.053 --> 54:41.652
Once inside, just shot.

54:42.054 --> 54:44.193
<i>Because of nightmares,
he never has good sleeps.</i>

54:44.453 --> 54:46.453
<i>He consume pills,
like he drinks water.</i>

55:03.142 --> 55:05.142
What's this? There's nobody?

55:05.543 --> 55:07.282
Wait a minute!

55:07.683 --> 55:08.612
Let me think.

55:08.612 --> 55:11.951
<i>There's no use to think.</i>

55:19.821 --> 55:21.562
What's so funny?

55:30.361 --> 55:32.101
Kang Seong Il is not coming?

55:33.840 --> 55:36.371
<i>Date estimation: 22nd at 1900 hours.</i>

55:36.371 --> 55:38.641
How busy is he?
This is making me upset.

55:49.049 --> 55:50.520
Seems like they have failed to catch him.

55:52.791 --> 55:54.790
He might have known about our arrival.

55:56.660 --> 55:59.990
Nevermind.
He'll come here forsure.

56:02.130 --> 56:03.870
<i>Long time no see.</i>

56:04.269 --> 56:09.739
25 Browning automatic  guns, 3 homemade bomb.
24 Soviet PPS-43 submachine guns.

56:10.809 --> 56:12.139
You can check it first.

56:35.227 --> 56:37.498
<i>Those scumbags wont open their mouth till the end.</i>

56:38.299 --> 56:40.298
<i>Such loyalty, not even thinking
about their own life & safety...</i>

56:40.298 --> 56:42.697
<i>What made them so devoted?</i>

56:44.307 --> 56:46.709
If it's really impossible,
I'll pay the compensation later.

56:46.709 --> 56:48.838
Why are you like this?

56:49.777 --> 56:51.507
Oh, she is the owner of this bookstore.

56:51.507 --> 56:52.707
Someone I know.

56:52.707 --> 56:55.118
He's a public prosecutor.
Please treat him well.

56:55.378 --> 56:57.787
Oh yes, the attic...

56:57.787 --> 57:00.586
=We will always on the people's side.=

57:01.517 --> 57:05.387
=In this moment, our nation is on
the edge of disaster.=

57:06.057 --> 57:09.497
=When the enemy brave enough to provoke,=

57:10.226 --> 57:12.926
=whenever and in whatever situation,=

57:13.267 --> 57:17.267
=I will defend and
protect this society with whatever way I can.=

57:17.267 --> 57:19.536
=If the nation believe me,
I will win!=

57:19.536 --> 57:22.876
=I will put the nation interest,
above anything else that matter.=

57:39.954 --> 57:41.296
I'm gonna sleep.

57:42.356 --> 57:45.025
If you already woken up, just wake up.

57:48.634 --> 57:51.305
<i>Why didn't you buy the plaster a bit more?</i>

57:51.705 --> 57:53.304
<i>How much do we have?</i>

57:54.904 --> 57:56.374
We still have a lot.

57:56.374 --> 57:57.574
Is that your saving?

57:57.574 --> 58:00.245
I saved it for Grandfather's eye-glassess.

58:00.374 --> 58:02.244
It's okay.
I start saving again next time.

58:02.244 --> 58:05.983
I gave this inn's phone number
to that man at the wokshop.

58:07.854 --> 58:10.784
Aigoo, can you tie-up her hair?

58:11.184 --> 58:13.723
<i>So messy.
How can we gonna move together?</i>

58:14.124 --> 58:18.393
Hair band...
Grandfather keeps it.

58:19.863 --> 58:21.334
Mal Soon's hair...

58:21.334 --> 58:23.192
Grandfather used to tie-up her hair...

58:30.003 --> 58:33.602
Mister, I wont cry.

58:35.214 --> 58:38.812
I'm the bigger one.
I cannot cry.

58:40.682 --> 58:42.152
Grandfather said that.

58:49.892 --> 58:51.621
Mal Soon and I...

58:52.822 --> 58:55.762
for us, the only important person in
whole world is our grandfather.

58:56.961 --> 59:01.231
He's health decline.
His eyes condition have worsen.

59:01.772 --> 59:06.701
Everytime he's  sick,
people bashed him.

59:08.041 --> 59:11.911
But when he saw
both of us have something to eat

59:13.241 --> 59:15.380
he said he wasn't suffering.

59:25.260 --> 59:27.789
Can we go back home
one more time?

59:27.929 --> 59:30.861
Grandfather told us to wait
at home & he will come back.

59:30.861 --> 59:31.660
May be, he's home...

59:31.660 --> 59:34.730
<i>Don't talk rubbish!
That s-o-b...</i>

59:39.400 --> 59:41.669
Why haven't I think about this?

59:43.139 --> 59:45.939
Dong Yi, if they failed to find it,

59:46.480 --> 59:48.209
it means it's not there.

01:00:26.647 --> 01:00:31.988
<i>With Kim Byeong Deok is a secret account journal.
Owned by Gwangeunhwe.</i>

01:00:31.988 --> 01:00:36.527
<i>Since long time ago, founded as a religious organization,
now it become a strong political organization,</i>

01:00:36.527 --> 01:00:38.256
<i>corrupted to the core.</i>

01:00:38.657 --> 01:00:41.197
<i>A group that fanatic for power.</i>

01:00:41.197 --> 01:00:43.067
<i>Nobody know how much funds</i>

01:00:43.067 --> 01:00:44.136
<i>has gone to the Gwangeunhwe organization.</i>

01:00:44.136 --> 01:00:45.466
<i>People who investigate about it</i>

01:00:45.466 --> 01:00:47.607
<i>has gone either missing
or died in accidents.</i>

01:00:49.066 --> 01:00:52.006
<i>In the new election this time,
Gwangeunhwe is trying to get more power.</i>

01:00:52.006 --> 01:00:54.807
<i>They need to avoid scandals
and get more fund.</i>

01:00:55.076 --> 01:00:56.946
<i>The terror of war that spreaded
by these bastards</i>

01:00:56.946 --> 01:00:58.416
<i>is now influencing the people.</i>

01:00:58.416 --> 01:00:59.216
<i>If the the terror come true,</i>

01:00:59.216 --> 01:01:00.675
<i>or if some big incident happen,</i>

01:01:00.675 --> 01:01:03.616
the nation will fall under Gwangeunhwe's power.

01:01:03.616 --> 01:01:08.425
The person that really want this to
happen is Kang Seong Il.

01:01:08.826 --> 01:01:11.625
=If I can't prove the existing of Gwangeunhwe...=

01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:12.696
<i>What is that?</i>

01:01:12.696 --> 01:01:14.564
=...if only I can find the documents related to them...=

01:01:14.564 --> 01:01:15.365
=all those bastard involved----=

01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:17.225
I asked you to send some money.

01:01:18.435 --> 01:01:22.565
You...
You  still want to talk nonsense like this?

01:01:22.565 --> 01:01:23.904
=Tomorrow is the 24th.=

01:01:23.904 --> 01:01:26.036
All our members are
pursuing this case.

01:01:29.104 --> 01:01:30.444
Okay, Hong Seojang.
[Seojang - Police Inspector]

01:01:30.444 --> 01:01:32.715
=I have questions for you first.=

01:01:33.914 --> 01:01:36.444
Kim Byeong Deok grandchildren,
why did you took them?

01:01:38.454 --> 01:01:40.053
=Are you crazy?=

01:01:40.053 --> 01:01:41.384
=Didn't I said not to...=

01:01:46.723 --> 01:01:52.063
<i>Dong Yi, Mal Soon...
and the people of Myeongwol-ri...</i>

01:01:53.134 --> 01:01:57.263
<i>The innocent people who are the victim of a big lie...</i>

01:01:58.733 --> 01:02:00.872
<i>One day, there would be an enemy
who will aim his gun & shot them all.</i>

01:02:00.872 --> 01:02:03.003
<i>Those with sharp eyes
will save themselves.</i>

01:02:03.003 --> 01:02:04.743
<i>all comunication will be cut-off</i>

01:02:04.743 --> 01:02:10.483
<i>October 24th, at 2100 hours...
all residents of Myeongwol-ri will be destroyed.</i>

01:02:12.883 --> 01:02:15.553
<i>Kang Seong Il and Gwangeunhwe
will be ready to strike,</i>

01:02:17.022 --> 01:02:20.493
<i>also, my mother's murderer, Kim Byeong Deok...</i>

01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:28.632
<i>Everyone of them including me
has the same mark.</i>

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.429
<i>Kim Byeong Deok knows everything.</i>

01:03:34.429 --> 01:03:36.028
<i>I need to find that oldman first.</i>

01:03:36.298 --> 01:03:38.028
What should we do now?

01:03:39.228 --> 01:03:40.969
Why are you asking me?

01:03:41.769 --> 01:03:44.708
You promised to find our grandfather, didn't you?

01:03:45.908 --> 01:03:48.037
Are you angry with me?

01:03:48.037 --> 01:03:50.708
Mister, we have a better idea.

01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:52.309
We sketch grandfather's face,

01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:54.848
and put it everywhere.

01:03:55.777 --> 01:03:58.047
How can you come up with that?

01:03:58.988 --> 01:04:01.917
I wished I can use my brain too.

01:04:02.587 --> 01:04:06.057
Lets think!
Kim Dong Yi, you got good grades aren't you?

01:04:06.057 --> 01:04:08.058
You think your grandfather lost
his way on the street?

01:04:08.058 --> 01:04:09.528
He's been captured & locked away.

01:04:09.528 --> 01:04:11.268
In a place so remotely--

01:04:13.527 --> 01:04:14.597
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

01:04:16.598 --> 01:04:18.207
Dong Yi, let me see your notes.

01:04:18.737 --> 01:04:19.407
Here.

01:04:27.817 --> 01:04:30.876
<i>Seriously, this idiot!</i>

01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:36.486
Hello, this is Sangmun bookshop.

01:04:36.486 --> 01:04:37.956
Is Yeong Hwan there?

01:04:38.486 --> 01:04:41.425
Ah,the public prosecutor.
Yeong Hwan Oppa is here.

01:04:41.955 --> 01:04:43.826
But just now, there's a phone call.

01:04:43.826 --> 01:04:46.896
From Taegang Workshop, if I'm not mistaken.
And it's urgent.

01:04:46.896 --> 01:04:47.836
Workshop?

01:04:47.836 --> 01:04:48.635
=He said someone's came.=

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:51.165
Forget that first.
Let me talk to YeongHwan.

01:04:51.165 --> 01:04:52.504
=He want to talk to you.=

01:04:55.706 --> 01:04:56.775
Yes, this is me

01:04:56.775 --> 01:04:59.174
What did you saw back then?

01:04:59.174 --> 01:04:59.704
Eh?

01:04:59.704 --> 01:05:01.846
When you're there to take the furniture,
what did you see?

01:05:04.645 --> 01:05:07.984
You... did you see an oldman there?

01:05:10.915 --> 01:05:15.724
Yes...
=Hey, seems like that is the oldman!=

01:05:15.724 --> 01:05:20.664
=Because it was not clear,
but I think there's someone there.=

01:05:20.664 --> 01:05:21.334
<i>Anybody home?</i>

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.863
=That time, I was telling you...=

01:05:23.863 --> 01:05:25.604
=But you're busy calling on the phone...=

01:05:26.004 --> 01:05:28.403
=Did you know, I went there yeaterday.=

01:05:28.403 --> 01:05:30.403
=It's true, isn't it?
I had the feeling..=

01:05:30.403 --> 01:05:31.743
=Yes, yes. It's true.=

01:05:31.743 --> 01:05:32.673
=I saw the oldman.=

01:05:32.673 --> 01:05:33.743
=I saw him twice.=

01:05:33.743 --> 01:05:34.813
Where is that place?

01:05:34.813 --> 01:05:37.473
=Where?
How can I explain it?=

01:05:37.473 --> 01:05:40.143
=Ah, yes... after you leave the city.=

01:05:40.684 --> 01:05:46.022
Hello? What is this? Hello?

01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:52.562
<i>1500 hours, start from Wolgil-ri, every 2 hours...
regional communication will cut-off.</i>

01:05:59.232 --> 01:06:02.831
<i>Why is the workshop looking for me?</i>

01:06:06.972 --> 01:06:09.242
<i>A place with the shortest distance from the oldman...</i>

01:06:09.242 --> 01:06:11.912
Are you okay?

01:06:13.782 --> 01:06:18.321
On the way there, stop at the workshop first.
Have problem with the car.

01:06:26.861 --> 01:06:28.061
He escaped?

01:06:42.741 --> 01:06:44.880
Why is it so hard to contact you?

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:49.009
Can't even find you at the police station.

01:06:49.009 --> 01:06:50.610
Are you working or not?

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:51.950
Did you found it?

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:54.889
The oldman's left eye is blind, right?

01:06:56.749 --> 01:06:59.420
He was here.
The kid's grandfather.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:03.029
He came? Here?

01:07:07.698 --> 01:07:10.229
<i>Was busy looking for the kids.
Said wanna go home.</i>

01:07:10.769 --> 01:07:13.699
<i>Don't know where he came from.
His condition is so...</i>

01:07:13.969 --> 01:07:15.839
<i>So I asked him to rest here for awhile.</i>

01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:19.038
Don't tell anybody about this.

01:07:20.778 --> 01:07:22.109
Hello!

01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:34.117
How can I say this?
Erm...

01:07:38.398 --> 01:07:39.728
<i>Kang Seong Il!</i>

01:07:42.397 --> 01:07:43.396
<i>My gun!</i>

01:07:45.998 --> 01:07:48.137
<i>If get caught now,
everything is doomed.</i>

01:07:51.066 --> 01:07:53.337
Just chit-chat with him and ask him
to leave. Don't get caught.

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:02.148
You came?

01:08:02.148 --> 01:08:03.346
It's done?

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:06.956
It's outside.
You can take it & just go.

01:08:09.226 --> 01:08:13.756
Just go?

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:24.836
Oh, 15 thousand.
I gave you 5000 discount, so it'd be 11 thousand only.

01:08:36.585 --> 01:08:38.314
Kim Mal Soon, you know where is the car, right?

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.055
Open the bag and there's a gun.

01:08:40.055 --> 01:08:41.925
Take the gun & hurry come back here.

01:08:45.394 --> 01:08:47.524
<i>Aigoo, my foot...</i>

01:08:52.594 --> 01:08:54.734
Mal Soon, right! Right!

01:09:37.442 --> 01:09:38.902
Why close the door?

01:09:38.902 --> 01:09:40.511
It seems like one's inside.

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:43.712
Wh--Who?

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.051
Why are--?

01:09:58.661 --> 01:09:59.992
You... that...

01:09:59.992 --> 01:10:03.060
Did I said that you need to
the homework first?

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:09.740
<i>This useless kid.</i>

01:10:45.369 --> 01:10:47.909
Don't let me catch you.

<i>Why came here?
Damn it.</i>

01:11:12.467 --> 01:11:13.797
Nearly gave me a heart attack.

01:11:21.808 --> 01:11:23.278
Thank you.

01:11:32.347 --> 01:11:35.416
<i>Mister, for Mal Soon and I...</i>

I'll pay back to you later.

01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:54.775
Please send them to the bookshop.

01:11:55.835 --> 01:11:57.306
Alright..

01:11:58.245 --> 01:11:59.975
I didn't do it for the money.

01:11:59.975 --> 01:12:02.376
But because of these kids are
young & so pitiful.

01:12:11.055 --> 01:12:15.725
Dong Yi, Mal Soon,
both of you trust me, right?

01:12:15.725 --> 01:12:16.655

We trust you, Mister.

01:12:24.265 --> 01:12:28.004
Dont' ask anything.
Follow that mister.

01:12:28.274 --> 01:12:29.474
I'll be back later.

The first Gwangeunhwe journal

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:45.681
is in your hand.

01:13:45.681 --> 01:13:50.751
The secret journal with all Gwangeunhwe evil deeds
that cannot be exposed to the public.

01:13:50.751 --> 01:13:53.421
Tomorrow, the 24th at 9pm...

01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:55.690
those bastards will gather all
Myeongwol-ri's residents

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:57.290
and all will be killed.

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:01.420
You know about this
and using it as a shield

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.760
and intended to leave this place.

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:05.560
But that's not possible
in current situation.

01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:09.969
Do you feel helpless?

01:14:11.168 --> 01:14:13.170
I'm here to help you.

01:14:18.908 --> 01:14:24.918
Mister, is it true that our grandfather--

01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:29.890
Dong Yi, wait.
That is the man from previously, right?

01:14:30.389 --> 01:14:35.989
Tomorrow night is coming soon.
There's no more time left.

01:14:36.258 --> 01:14:37.188
Tell me!

01:14:37.188 --> 01:14:41.328
My grandchildren..

01:14:41.328 --> 01:14:43.069
I'll make sure you'd meet them.

01:14:45.198 --> 01:14:50.137
If you want me to help you,
you have to tell me everything.

01:14:52.138 --> 01:14:53.608
Going out from here without preparation...

01:14:53.608 --> 01:14:55.077
we'll get caught in no time.

01:14:58.547 --> 01:15:00.147
That incident...

01:15:00.418 --> 01:15:03.346
what you heard, saw,
everything you know...

01:15:03.886 --> 01:15:07.088
Not even one word of a lie.
Tell me now.

01:15:15.367 --> 01:15:20.166
I... started from there.

01:15:20.296 --> 01:15:27.106
<i>There, everyone under their power
live together.</i>

01:15:28.445 --> 01:15:30.176
<i>Gwangeunhwe leader...</i>

01:15:30.575 --> 01:15:34.986
<i>For him, everyone would
do anything.</i>

01:15:35.645 --> 01:15:39.256
<i>Once you're in,
you wouldn't dare to leave.</i>

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:44.055
<i>Those bastards, have no mercy even
for 6 years old kid.</i>

01:15:44.055 --> 01:15:46.455
<i>They'd easily broke the children's legs.</i>

01:15:48.325 --> 01:15:51.935
<i>They seized people's hard earn money.
Pushed them into debts.</i>

01:15:52.195 --> 01:15:53.796
<i>Those with power
all took bribes.</i>

01:15:53.796 --> 01:15:55.935
<i>They pretend not to see what really happened.</i>

01:15:56.204 --> 01:16:01.535
<i>I know how to do bookkeeping & some math.
So I like to do account journal.</i>

01:16:01.535 --> 01:16:04.874
<i>With my hand, every data was
written in the journal.</i>

01:16:05.274 --> 01:16:10.345
Listen to me.
They're planninng to kill again.

01:16:10.485 --> 01:16:12.354
They still exist.

01:16:12.883 --> 01:16:15.153
In this world, there's nothing
impossible for them.

01:16:15.153 --> 01:16:19.694
Wait! So the one you killed...

01:16:23.693 --> 01:16:28.234
Have you kill anyone?

01:16:39.042 --> 01:16:41.043
I escaped,once.

01:16:42.912 --> 01:16:47.713
Gwangeunhwe's Leader, Hong Sang Ji...

01:16:49.852 --> 01:16:52.521
<i>He likes to rape women.</i>

01:16:53.453 --> 01:16:56.262
<i>He didn't care whether it's an adult or a kid.</i>

01:16:57.323 --> 01:17:00.662
<i>I was afraid that my daughter will be his victim.
I was scared.</i>

01:17:00.662 --> 01:17:02.663
<i>I need to run away.</i>

01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:06.931
<i>A lady who follow me at that time</i>

01:17:06.931 --> 01:17:10.001
<i>was also running away to protect his son.</i>

01:17:15.211 --> 01:17:17.610
<i>But we're captured.</i>

01:17:18.951 --> 01:17:24.150
<i>They gave order.
One of us need to die.</i>

01:17:24.551 --> 01:17:27.351
<i>That's why I picked up the gun.</i>

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:41.771
So you regret killing that lady...

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.369
That's why intended to ask for forgiveness, right?

01:17:52.449 --> 01:17:57.120
No. Even if I have to do it again,
I will still do the same.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:01.249
If I didn't do it,
my daughter will die.

01:18:01.519 --> 01:18:03.388
For the sake of my daugther,

01:18:03.519 --> 01:18:06.730
be it  10 or even 20,
I will kill them all.

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:07.390
What?

01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:08.859
You want me to apologize?

01:18:08.859 --> 01:18:12.198
You asked me if I regret it?
I don't need--

01:18:12.198 --> 01:18:14.198
Except for my daugther, I dont need anything else.

01:18:14.198 --> 01:18:18.198
Say it again.
Say that you regret it.

01:18:20.468 --> 01:18:21.937
Who are you?

01:18:26.348 --> 01:18:27.547
Was it you?

01:18:29.278 --> 01:18:30.218
The son?

01:18:30.218 --> 01:18:34.747
Even if you lie,it's okay.
Say that you regret it.

01:19:11.716 --> 01:19:15.856
Dong Yi, Mal Soon...

01:19:56.034 --> 01:19:57.494
Where's the owner?

01:20:15.913 --> 01:20:17.513
What're you guys doing here?

01:20:20.322 --> 01:20:22.322
Is the oldman here?

01:20:38.471 --> 01:20:40.203
Oldman!

01:20:49.282 --> 01:20:51.011
Grandfather!

01:20:51.951 --> 01:20:54.221
Grandfather!

01:20:58.092 --> 01:20:59.701
Mal Soon!

01:21:05.831 --> 01:21:09.570
Oldman, are you ok?
Oldman!

01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:11.571
<i>We're here!</i>

01:21:11.571 --> 01:21:14.100
Dong Yi! Mal Soon!

01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:17.310
Dong Yi! Mal Soon!

01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:18.910
Mister!

01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:22.249
You wait for me!
I'm going inside.

01:21:30.389 --> 01:21:31.049
Hello?

01:21:31.049 --> 01:21:33.860
Geumsa-nim, oh it's you.
Thank god.

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.389
=I found him! The oldman!=

01:21:36.389 --> 01:21:37.189
Where are you?

01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:40.658
What happened?
The kids also captured.

01:21:40.658 --> 01:21:41.458
The kids?

01:21:41.458 --> 01:21:43.869
=The kids, Dong Yi and Mal Soon.=

01:21:43.869 --> 01:21:47.069
You have to hurry up & come here.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.208
I'm not really sure the address.

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:55.748
In front of my house, there's the main road, right?
Pass it through the right & you'll see a cottage.

01:21:55.748 --> 01:22:00.419
=But the place is a bit...=

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.996
=How are your feeling after meeting him?=

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:49.525
=Did the oldman apologize to you?=

01:22:49.525 --> 01:22:52.736
Did you give it a proper thought?

01:22:52.736 --> 01:22:55.806
Where's the oldman...

01:22:55.806 --> 01:22:58.465
=and who you really are...=

01:22:58.465 --> 01:23:02.605
=What is this place?=

01:23:02.605 --> 01:23:04.745
=I'll be waiting for you.=

01:23:08.615 --> 01:23:15.155
Sajang-nim? Oppa? Hello?

01:23:15.155 --> 01:23:17.424
What did he said?

01:24:01.463 --> 01:24:05.731
<i>Don't move!</i>

01:24:05.731 --> 01:24:08.531
<i>Mom!</i>

01:27:14.983 --> 01:27:18.454
Finally, you're here, Hong Gil Dong.

01:27:20.183 --> 01:27:21.123
Where is the journal?

01:27:21.123 --> 01:27:24.854
Journal? I don't know
anything about the journal.

01:27:28.322 --> 01:27:31.533
You can stop it now.

01:27:35.532 --> 01:27:36.872
Still remember?

01:27:36.872 --> 01:27:38.733
I was bitten by a dog once.

01:27:38.733 --> 01:27:41.542
You're the one who chased
that dog using a peeble.

01:27:41.542 --> 01:27:43.812
We're still young child at that time.

01:27:45.943 --> 01:27:47.543
Don't worry.

01:27:47.543 --> 01:27:50.212
I'm not planning to hurt you.

01:27:50.882 --> 01:27:55.022
Oh really? I dont want to fight too.

01:27:55.952 --> 01:27:59.161
Is it true? Can I trust you?

01:27:59.161 --> 01:28:01.161
Just trust me.

01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:03.291
If I let you go now,

01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:04.892
can you bring it here?

01:28:04.892 --> 01:28:08.761
I'd have brought it here from the start.

01:28:09.572 --> 01:28:14.371
But before that, can you
give me the oldman & the kids to me?

01:28:14.371 --> 01:28:16.110
Of course.

01:28:16.110 --> 01:28:18.371
Like you had wanted,

01:28:22.111 --> 01:28:25.180
you can take Kim Byeong Deok's body
out of here.

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:29.321
If you do it,I think I can trust you
and let all of you go.

01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:32.920
Didn't you look for Kim Byeong Deok
because you wanna kill him?

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.190
Like how your mother was killed?

01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:36.260
Just like what you saw.

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.389
What do you want now?

01:28:39.059 --> 01:28:42.000
There's Kim Byeong Deok and the kids.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.470
Do it here.
There're bullets in the pistol.

01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:47.200
Why?

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.268
Isn't this familiar to you?

01:28:58.149 --> 01:29:00.818
Kill that oldman and join us.

01:29:00.818 --> 01:29:04.149
The world will change.

01:29:05.089 --> 01:29:09.487
<i>I'm the only person that can understand you</i>

01:29:09.487 --> 01:29:15.228
<i>We'll be on your side.</i>

01:29:58.607 --> 01:30:00.607
I'm sorry.

01:30:08.346 --> 01:30:10.885
<i>Grandfather!</i>

01:30:12.344 --> 01:30:14.615
I'll give it to you.

01:30:16.885 --> 01:30:19.025
But the journal is not with me now.

01:30:19.025 --> 01:30:21.295
You searched me, didn't you?

01:30:21.295 --> 01:30:23.564
Let me use the phone.

01:30:23.564 --> 01:30:25.165
They'd bring it here.

01:30:25.165 --> 01:30:27.695
Why are you being like this?

01:30:27.695 --> 01:30:31.035
- Didn't I said don't be like this?
- Dong Yi.

01:30:32.504 --> 01:30:36.505
Till this moment,
did you sense anything strange?

01:30:37.175 --> 01:30:42.244
Why am I with you guys?

01:30:42.244 --> 01:30:47.584
Why am I looking for your grandfather?

01:30:47.584 --> 01:30:51.584
An employee of National Registration Dept,
why am I looking for him?

01:30:52.654 --> 01:30:55.594
Do this make sense to you?

01:30:56.393 --> 01:31:01.863
Why are you so stupid
and follow me?

01:31:04.663 --> 01:31:08.933
I'll tell you the truth.

01:31:09.474 --> 01:31:11.872
Shut up, oldman!

01:31:13.612 --> 01:31:20.812
The reason that I looked for your grandfather
is to kill him

01:31:23.223 --> 01:31:29.091
And to kill him in front of you & your sister.

01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:34.432
A long time ago, your grandfather
did it to me.

01:31:34.432 --> 01:31:38.161
<i>Answer me! Kim Dong Yi, Kim Mal Soon
what'd you do?</i>

01:31:38.161 --> 01:31:46.312
When I  woke up from my nightmare and I saw your face,
do you know how much I suffered to hold the anger?

01:31:46.312 --> 01:31:52.040
Friends? Don't me me laugh!

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:58.720
You're my enemy's blood!

01:32:11.399 --> 01:32:13.800
Kim Byeong Deok will die with my hands.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:23.939
However, he will not die like this.

01:32:23.939 --> 01:32:26.880
Give me a change to make a call.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.419
They will bring it here.

01:32:42.899 --> 01:32:47.027
<i>What I've said is not important.</i>

01:32:47.027 --> 01:32:52.499
<i>They didn't think what I said
is important.</i>

01:32:54.237 --> 01:32:57.578
<i>I need to trust myself first.</i>

01:32:57.578 --> 01:33:03.848
<i>Make a call, then someone
will bring the journal here...</i>

01:33:05.178 --> 01:33:08.648
On a second thought,
the phone can't be connected now.

01:34:13.915 --> 01:34:16.184
Grandfather!

01:35:46.269 --> 01:35:48.270
Save yourself first!

01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:52.140
I'll bring Dong Yi
and Mal Soon out of here.

01:35:53.479 --> 01:36:01.080
Go! Don't let me
see you again.

01:36:34.449 --> 01:36:35.778
Dong Yi!

01:36:35.778 --> 01:36:39.247
Forget what I said just now.

01:36:39.247 --> 01:36:41.658
They're all lies.

01:36:43.658 --> 01:36:46.997
Kim Dong Yi, don't you know me?

01:36:46.997 --> 01:36:49.927
My words are all lies.

01:36:49.927 --> 01:36:51.797
Get Mal Soon and follow me!

01:36:51.797 --> 01:36:54.337
Grandfather is waiting
for you outside.

01:36:55.796 --> 01:36:59.407
For the last time, trust me.

01:37:00.216 --> 01:37:01.217
Dong Yi...

01:37:02.617 --> 01:37:03.606
Mal Soon...

01:37:08.076 --> 01:37:10.346
Wait for me here.

01:37:12.217 --> 01:37:16.756
Damn this oldman.
I told him to get out, what're still doing in here?

01:37:22.226 --> 01:37:24.095
Mal Soon...

01:37:24.095 --> 01:37:26.894
<i>Grandfather! Grandfather!</i>

01:37:26.894 --> 01:37:28.636
Dong Yi!

01:37:30.506 --> 01:37:32.365
<i>Don't! You bastard!</i>

01:37:40.774 --> 01:37:42.514
You disappoint me.

01:38:15.344 --> 01:38:17.344
Grandfather!

01:38:18.943 --> 01:38:20.412
Mal Soon...

01:38:26.153 --> 01:38:27.622
Mal Soon!

01:38:34.832 --> 01:38:36.562
Mal Soon!

01:38:37.903 --> 01:38:39.771
Kim Mal Soon!

01:38:39.771 --> 01:38:42.032
Mal Soon!

01:38:42.572 --> 01:38:44.301
Kim Mal Soon!

01:38:53.382 --> 01:38:56.581
Kim Mal Soon!

01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:48.499
<i>Mister,my name is Kim Mal Soon.</i>

01:39:48.499 --> 01:39:50.099
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:39:50.099 --> 01:39:53.168
<i>You don't get a good sleep
and you're hurt.</i>

01:39:53.168 --> 01:39:55.969
<i>You wanna help us to find grandfather.</i>

01:39:55.969 --> 01:39:58.509
<i>I didn't cooperate with you.</i>

01:39:58.509 --> 01:40:03.579
<i>I wished you're our uncle.</i>

01:40:03.579 --> 01:40:05.849
<i>Being friends like now
is great too.</i>

01:40:05.849 --> 01:40:08.787
<i>Yours, Kim Mal Soon.</i>

01:40:14.388 --> 01:40:15.858
Oldman...

01:40:15.858 --> 01:40:19.328
What is Kim Mal Soon doing right now?

01:40:59.366 --> 01:41:01.506
Dong Yi...

01:41:08.046 --> 01:41:10.315
Grandfather...

01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:15.645
Have you eat?

01:41:16.445 --> 01:41:18.715
I did.

01:41:20.325 --> 01:41:24.195
Where's Mal Soon?

01:41:24.195 --> 01:41:28.725
Mal Soon's tired,
so she's sleeping.

01:41:31.535 --> 01:41:48.483
Dong Yi, now on you need to
look after Mal Soon.

01:41:49.814 --> 01:41:57.023
Child, I can't take care of you anymore.

01:41:57.023 --> 01:42:12.632
Dong Yi, Mal Soon...
because of me, both of you suffered.

01:42:14.373 --> 01:42:26.922
Forgive me.

01:42:39.861 --> 01:42:42.661
Mister, is he dead?

01:43:02.151 --> 01:43:06.420
Just now, you said "It's okay".

01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:13.760
We ate tangsuyuk,
so it'll be okay.
<font color="#ffff00">[Tangsuyuk - sweet sour pork]</font>

01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:18.300
He died.

01:43:22.039 --> 01:43:24.709
Grandfather!

01:43:48.598 --> 01:43:52.467
<i>The 24the, the night come at last.</i>

01:43:52.467 --> 01:43:53.937
<i>Where should I go?</i>

01:43:53.937 --> 01:43:59.267
=Tonight at 8:30pm, meet me at Myeongwol-ri Inn.
Don't be late!=

01:44:17.287 --> 01:44:37.306
<i>Tonight at 8pm, all residents of Myeongwol-ri
will gather at the village hall.</i>

01:44:37.306 --> 01:44:41.316
<i>Attendance are cumpolsary.</i>

01:44:50.926 --> 01:44:52.125
Where's the journal?

01:44:52.125 --> 01:44:54.395
You asked me to bring it here.

01:44:56.124 --> 01:44:57.725
Why did you come back here?

01:44:57.725 --> 01:45:00.794
You had a chance to escape.
Why didn't you?

01:45:02.534 --> 01:45:04.004
What are you doing?

01:45:04.004 --> 01:45:06.135
1 minute left.

01:45:10.145 --> 01:45:12.674
1 minute, what?

01:45:12.674 --> 01:45:14.814
Wasn't it 9pm?

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:30.293
<i>What're really doing?</i>

01:45:30.293 --> 01:45:32.293
<i>Can't we talk to settle this?</i>

01:45:32.293 --> 01:45:38.303
Wait! Calm down first.

01:45:38.303 --> 01:45:40.573
Listen to me.

01:46:16.871 --> 01:46:18.200
Don't tell me...

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.341
=It's over.=

01:46:25.541 --> 01:46:27.550
Everything is done.

01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:32.481
All of Myeongwol-ri
and the small kid are dead.

01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:36.220
Gi Dong...

01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:41.431
In this world, there are people that important ,
and there's not important people too.

01:46:41.431 --> 01:46:43.560
If they're not importnt,
it's okay if they're gone.

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.361
Like those who're killed just now.

01:46:46.361 --> 01:46:49.970
Help me...
Forgive me.

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:00.109
I really hope you'll
come to our side.

01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:03.178
Long ago, Father always worried about you.

01:47:03.718 --> 01:47:05.979
He said you'd turn
into someone dangerous.

01:47:40.818 --> 01:47:42.418
Why is this?

01:47:44.957 --> 01:47:49.628
Why? The guns' not good?

01:48:37.535 --> 01:48:42.744
Gunsu Seojang, Boan Gwajang
hasn't meet these people for awhile, right?
<font color="#ffff00">[Gunsu Seojang - mayor; Boan Gwajang - Chief of Public security]</font>

01:48:43.275 --> 01:48:46.874
So, what really happened?

01:48:46.874 --> 01:48:49.544
<i>You gave bribe with double the money.</i>

01:48:49.544 --> 01:48:51.414
=To contact them is impossible.=

01:48:51.414 --> 01:48:54.624
<i>If not do it correctly,
there'll be a huge problem.</i>

01:48:54.624 --> 01:48:58.094
=We have to do all this?
You think we're experts?=

01:48:58.094 --> 01:49:00.364
<i>Gunpowder?
There shouldn't be.</i>

01:49:00.364 --> 01:49:02.364
<i>We've destroyed everything.</i>

01:49:02.364 --> 01:49:04.633
<i>the moment you pull the trigger,
you expect a shot, right?</i>

01:49:04.633 --> 01:49:07.564
<i>All real bullet,
have been used during the test.</i>

01:49:07.564 --> 01:49:10.904
<i>what are you guys doing?</i>

01:49:10.904 --> 01:49:15.043
<i>All the peole who're deceived with you
are kidnapped.</i>

01:49:15.043 --> 01:49:16.903
<i>We found all of them.
Do we need to catch them?</i>

01:49:16.903 --> 01:49:19.312
<i>Of course.Why are you asking the obvious?
Catch all of them!</i>

01:49:19.312 --> 01:49:24.783
<i>But the sound of shooting that you heard
at 8:30pm just now, what is it?</i>

01:49:24.783 --> 01:49:28.382
<i>Now you undersatdn what happened, right?</i>

01:49:28.382 --> 01:49:31.322
<i>Kang Seong Il, the day after you met me,</i>

01:49:31.322 --> 01:49:33.322
<i>you've turned crazy.</i>

01:49:33.322 --> 01:49:37.062
<i>Eventhough what happened to Kim Byeong Deok
is not as my wishes.</i>

01:49:37.993 --> 01:49:41.602
<i>The real residents of Myeongwol-ri
left home 2 hours ago.</i>

01:49:41.602 --> 01:49:44.402
<i>They're watching a movie right now.</i>

01:49:44.402 --> 01:49:46.932
<i>Like what you have done at the previous village,</i>

01:49:46.932 --> 01:49:51.741
<i>a movie with gun shooting sound was played,
to cover everything.They wont even hear anything.</i>

01:49:51.741 --> 01:49:54.811
<i>-Oh, there is people who shouldn't live.
- Get out!</i>

01:49:54.811 --> 01:49:58.410
<i>People like you, who only think of power
and do whatever pleasure you.</i>

01:49:58.410 --> 01:50:03.620
<i>To destroy people like you
is my job.</i>

01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:06.021
<i>Eventhough I'm not a good guy myself.</i>

01:50:06.021 --> 01:50:07.491
<i>It's done.</i>

01:50:08.291 --> 01:50:10.431
Is anyone there?

01:50:10.431 --> 01:50:12.030
Anyone, answer this!

01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:13.630
=I asnwer this.
So what?=

01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:15.231
Put down you weapon.

01:50:15.231 --> 01:50:17.231
If you want to live a bit longer.

01:50:17.231 --> 01:50:21.640
=From now on, you'll see the real hell.=

01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:25.370
<i>Lets get this done.</i>

01:50:27.509 --> 01:50:34.579
This is the punishment for you to go againts Hong Gil Dong.

01:52:46.973 --> 01:52:50.584
This time, I'll forgive you all.
So later, tell the truth.

01:52:50.584 --> 01:52:51.244
Okay.

01:52:51.244 --> 01:52:54.713
If this ever happen again,

01:52:54.713 --> 01:52:56.713
we'll going meet again.

01:52:56.713 --> 01:52:59.783
Next time, it'd not be settle
with guns.

01:53:08.862 --> 01:53:11.932
A true family clan of trash,
a name I'd never heard.

01:53:11.932 --> 01:53:15.673
Isn't it right, Kang Seong Il?

01:53:15.673 --> 01:53:19.801
The second son of Chief Hwang
the leader of Gwangeunhwe...

01:53:19.801 --> 01:53:24.742
<i>Once was a soft & good hearted child.</i>

01:53:24.742 --> 01:53:29.012
After you change your name, how did you turned
to monster like this?

01:53:29.012 --> 01:53:33.552
Don't assume you have win.

01:53:34.751 --> 01:53:39.021
You don't know us.

01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:45.960
Father will find you.

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.111
You wont catch me.

01:53:54.111 --> 01:53:57.169
Because I'm someone who never exist in this world.

01:53:57.169 --> 01:53:59.981
How can you catch me?

01:54:01.981 --> 01:54:10.920
Hyeong, I don't even have an ID card.

01:54:42.548 --> 01:54:44.289
Mal Soon!

01:54:44.289 --> 01:54:46.018
<i>Kim Mal Soon!</i>

01:54:46.018 --> 01:54:48.688
<i>Kim Mal Soon, wake up now!</i>

01:54:52.826 --> 01:54:54.568
Mister...

01:54:54.568 --> 01:54:56.828
Lets go!

01:55:00.437 --> 01:55:04.308
<i>The next day, people go on like normal.</i>

01:55:04.308 --> 01:55:06.177
<i>At the work place like before.</i>

01:55:06.177 --> 01:55:10.177
<i>With the same face, same thought.</i>

01:55:10.177 --> 01:55:15.516
<i>Those who sacrifice to look for their love ones and lie.</i>

01:55:15.516 --> 01:55:19.256
<i>Innocently, they believed us.</i>

01:55:19.256 --> 01:55:24.196
<i>Nobody knows what really happen at this village.</i>

01:55:24.196 --> 01:55:27.666
<i>Controvercy surfaced after
the leak of the Gwangeunhwe secret journal...</i>

01:55:27.666 --> 01:55:30.326
<i>The existance of such organization is proven,</i>

01:55:30.326 --> 01:55:34.606
<i>those who're suspected related to them,
were question throughly.</i>

01:55:34.606 --> 01:55:39.005
<i>The secret jornal of Gwangeunhwe
brings alot of suffering to the public.</i>

01:55:39.005 --> 01:55:43.405
<i>The death of Kim Byeong Deok
made Kim Dong Yi heartbroken.</i>

01:55:43.405 --> 01:55:47.275
Sis, where's grandfather?

01:55:49.545 --> 01:55:54.754
He's gone to look for more money.

01:55:55.554 --> 01:56:00.894
Eat with me.
Listen to your teachers.

01:56:00.894 --> 01:56:03.825
He'll be back.

01:56:15.444 --> 01:56:16.244
Lets go!

01:56:16.244 --> 01:56:18.914
OK.

01:56:18.914 --> 01:56:21.044
Grandfather.

01:56:28.653 --> 01:56:34.924
Dong Yi, are you still don't want to talk to me?

01:56:40.532 --> 01:56:48.142
Grandfather is also like you.
He hadn't has good sleep.

01:56:48.142 --> 01:56:54.282
Because he always dreamt of the past.

01:56:57.882 --> 01:56:59.353
Mal Soon...

01:56:59.353 --> 01:57:00.952
Yes?

01:57:00.952 --> 01:57:05.352
Have I told you that my mother is a trash picker too?

01:57:05.352 --> 01:57:06.821
No.

01:57:08.162 --> 01:57:10.691
My mother..

01:57:10.691 --> 01:57:13.762
and I, since I was little I'd make my own money.

01:57:14.831 --> 01:57:20.431
Because of me, my mother refused to eat miyeok,
<font color="#ffff00">[Miyeok - seaweed</font>

01:57:20.431 --> 01:57:25.240
if there's miyeok soup,
I'd refused to eat.

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:28.311
She said even there's only soup,
I need to eat.

01:57:28.311 --> 01:57:33.509
She'd took out all miyeok
and leave only rice & soup for me to eat.

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:45.930
And there's a smell of papers on her.

01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:49.259
Did your mother come back?

01:57:52.469 --> 01:57:53.670
Seriously?

01:57:53.670 --> 01:57:54.739
Of course.

01:57:54.739 --> 01:57:56.469
You aren't lying again, are you?

01:57:56.469 --> 01:57:57.539
It's true!.

01:57:57.539 --> 01:57:59.669
What nonsense are you talking?

01:57:59.669 --> 01:58:02.210
It's nearby, right?
Over there?

01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:06.608
Mister, is true we wont
meet again after this?

01:58:09.818 --> 01:58:11.419
Looks like it.

01:58:11.419 --> 01:58:14.358
How if I miss you?

01:58:14.358 --> 01:58:17.688
If that happen... just remember me.

01:58:17.688 --> 01:58:20.758
We'd never forget you, Mister.

01:58:20.758 --> 01:58:24.098
Whatever happen, we wont forget you.

01:58:38.106 --> 01:58:39.978
Mister!

01:58:43.317 --> 01:58:44.387
What?

01:58:44.387 --> 01:58:47.718
I saved this for you,
I didn't eat it even one.

01:59:01.066 --> 01:59:04.406
Here!

01:59:04.406 --> 01:59:07.206
It's okay, I dont heve to eat it.

01:59:07.206 --> 01:59:15.345
Dong Yi, friends should share.
dont you know?

02:00:00.453 --> 02:00:04.464
<i>Mister, thank you.</i>

02:00:47.701 --> 02:00:50.772
<i>I dont have nightmare anymore.</i>

02:00:50.772 --> 02:00:57.041
<i>Because I know who I really am.
And who are my enemies.</i>

02:01:18.929 --> 02:01:22.270
<i>The monster who had shackle me...</i>

02:01:23.070 --> 02:01:24.800
<i>The hell's minions...</i>

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:27.069
<i>With my own hand...</i>
