00:10.755 --> 00:13.118
<i>My name is detective
Brett Hopper,</i>

00:13.423 --> 00:15.648
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

00:15.829 --> 00:16.975
Freeze !
Put your hands up !

00:17.072 --> 00:19.740
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

00:19.837 --> 00:21.688
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

00:22.038 --> 00:23.878
Who the hell are you people ?

00:24.031 --> 00:26.320
<i>My girlfriend Rita
will be in danger.</i>

00:26.429 --> 00:29.429
<i>I know all this because
I am living the same day...</i>

00:29.755 --> 00:31.323
<i>over and over again.</i>

00:31.424 --> 00:34.122
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

00:34.220 --> 00:35.635
<i>Every day,
I get another chance.</i>

00:35.726 --> 00:38.456
<i>For every decision,
there's a consequence.</i>

00:38.546 --> 00:40.068
<i>Every day,
I get another clue.</i>

00:40.173 --> 00:42.908
Hopper, you should have received
a package today. It's important.

00:43.009 --> 00:45.480
So far I've got an hourglass
with a fingerprint

00:45.590 --> 00:47.197
and a photo
from an old crime scene.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.277
I'm looking into a homicide
from 1991.

00:49.358 --> 00:51.701
- That's when I first met your old man.
- My father was there ?

00:51.737 --> 00:53.859
He was the lead detective on it.
But he didn't close it.

00:53.903 --> 00:55.797
Evidence went missing,
and it just all fell apart.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.638
<i>To find out more
about this evidence,</i>

00:57.738 --> 00:59.854
<i>I have to get past
Rita's ex-husband Chad...</i>

00:59.928 --> 01:02.049
Why do I get the feeling
you know more than you're telling ?

01:02.094 --> 01:03.989
- Because I do.
<i>- And go to the one place</i>

01:04.099 --> 01:05.801
<i>that's most dangerous to me...</i>

01:05.997 --> 01:07.363
<i>Police headquarter.</i>

01:13.975 --> 01:15.114
- Give me that.
- No.

01:15.215 --> 01:18.183
- Stop playing.
- What's... what's a "nitzberg" ?

01:18.925 --> 01:22.151
A nitzberg, that's a name I'm using
for this undercover thing.

01:22.196 --> 01:22.985
- Really ?
- Yeah.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.436
You're so not a nitzberg.

01:24.537 --> 01:26.661
- Well, that's the point.
- And who's Sid ?

01:26.759 --> 01:30.094
- Sid, there's a Sid on there ?
- Here. "Take hourglass to Sid."

01:30.192 --> 01:34.025
That's S-I-D, silly,
scientific investigations division.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.373
After I drop you off at work,
I'm going downtown.

01:36.486 --> 01:39.471
The hourglass is evidence,
and I need to see if S.I.D.

01:39.572 --> 01:41.034
can pull a print on it for me.

01:41.136 --> 01:42.694
Sounds like a busy day.

01:42.794 --> 01:44.507
Yeah, it's pretty crazy,

01:45.970 --> 01:47.769
but, for the first time
in a while,

01:48.110 --> 01:49.857
I think I see some daylight.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.175
- Watch commander.
- Yeah, this is Hopper. Any messages ?

01:57.372 --> 01:59.594
- Anybody looking for me ?
- Hang on, let me check.

01:59.695 --> 02:00.726
All right.

02:02.975 --> 02:04.704
Na Hop, nothing
but crickets on this end.

02:04.816 --> 02:06.767
All right, cool.
I'll call back later.

02:18.128 --> 02:19.501
Hopper. Hold up.

02:20.101 --> 02:21.557
I'll be there in 15.

02:22.788 --> 02:24.059
Hey, lieutenant.

02:25.052 --> 02:26.560
I know what's going on.

02:27.591 --> 02:28.711
You do ?

02:29.739 --> 02:32.077
What time is your I.A. meeting
with Shelton ?

02:32.734 --> 02:34.108
- At 3 :00.
- All right.

02:34.295 --> 02:36.968
You hang tough,
and don't do anything stupid.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.648
A little late for that.

02:45.909 --> 02:48.073
Don't touch the bobblehead.

02:49.153 --> 02:51.476
I need you to run a print
on this hourglass.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.569
Here you go. You know the drill.
Call you in about a week.

03:00.612 --> 03:02.582
- No. I need it today.
- That's gonna be a problem.

03:02.634 --> 03:05.145
I already got 20 guys
who need it yesterday.

03:05.896 --> 03:08.462
Hey, here's a thought. Why don't
you come back last week,

03:08.573 --> 03:11.283
and then I can have it ready
for you this afternoon ?

03:13.176 --> 03:14.743
So are we doing this or not ?

03:14.845 --> 03:17.419
All right. Can you run
this D.R. number for me instead ?

03:17.499 --> 03:18.916
Is it connected
to this hourglass ?

03:18.960 --> 03:20.748
Yeah, that's what
I'm trying to figure out.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.220
Come on,
it'll take two seconds.

03:25.184 --> 03:26.529
What's the number ?

03:26.668 --> 03:30.692
- "91-11"...
- 91 ? As in 1991 ?

03:30.861 --> 03:31.805
Yeah.

03:32.452 --> 03:36.839
"91-118394641."

03:42.829 --> 03:44.590
- That's weird.
- What ?

03:44.738 --> 03:47.295
You're the second cop to open up
this Jane Doe in a couple days.

03:47.384 --> 03:49.133
- Who's the first ?
- Some tool in I.A.,

03:49.151 --> 03:50.898
Chad Shelton.

03:54.932 --> 03:56.317
I need to talk to you.

03:57.761 --> 04:00.067
That's why we have a 3 :00.
Fix your watch. Come back then.

04:00.141 --> 04:02.138
Jane doe.
15-year-old homicide.

04:03.402 --> 04:04.958
Sounds fascinating.
Talk to cold case.

04:05.022 --> 04:06.704
Yeah, well, I hear
you're looking into it.

04:06.757 --> 04:08.861
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- It's a case my father worked on,

04:08.905 --> 04:10.665
an  unsolved homicide.

04:11.391 --> 04:13.026
Your dad had a lot of those.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.596
Be more specific.

04:14.697 --> 04:18.721
D.R. Number 91-118394641.

04:18.916 --> 04:20.821
- 4641, huh ?
- Yeah.

04:21.671 --> 04:22.997
Well, let me think.

04:25.239 --> 04:27.631
Is that the murder book ? Huh ?
Is that the case ?

04:28.682 --> 04:29.662
Maybe.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.029
Hey, man, why are you
messing with me ?

04:35.252 --> 04:36.570
'Cause I don't like you.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.414
Shelton.

04:49.694 --> 04:51.049
Yeah, yeah.

04:52.551 --> 04:53.610
I understand.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.615
For you.

05:03.620 --> 05:07.508
Detective Hopper, you're under arrest
for the murder of Alberto Garza.

05:09.487 --> 05:10.672
Why'd you do it, man ?

05:10.783 --> 05:13.887
I'm not saying a damn thing
until you bring me Rita Shelton.

05:20.324 --> 05:22.583
It's embarrassing, isn't it,
chained up ?

05:25.505 --> 05:27.285
I've got to get to my brother !

05:29.476 --> 05:32.021
I thought it'd be different
this time. Didn't you ?

05:33.081 --> 05:34.610
You know what
I'm talking about.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.462
You and me are the same,
salt and pepper,

05:36.572 --> 05:38.429
a couple of flies
in the ointment.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.288
You don't... you don't believe me ?
I can prove it.

05:44.598 --> 05:45.994
Give me your arm.

05:48.099 --> 05:51.519
Quick, before they take one of us away.
Just... come on, hurry up.

05:59.702 --> 06:01.923
I told you,
we taste the same !

06:02.034 --> 06:04.100
We all taste
just like chicken !

06:04.288 --> 06:07.476
Look, it gets worse before
it gets better. Just ask my brother.

06:48.150 --> 06:48.960
+

06:51.407 --> 06:54.126
Okay, listen to me.
Everything is gonna be all right.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.997
I'm gonna get you out of this.

06:58.639 --> 07:02.201
I wouldn't make any promises
just yet, detective Hopper.

07:02.350 --> 07:03.995
You and your friend
Ms. Shelton are here

07:04.094 --> 07:06.938
because you're going to confess
to the killing of Alberto Garza.

07:07.038 --> 07:08.952
Okay, okay, whatever you want.

07:09.207 --> 07:11.121
Okay ? Just...
just let Rita go.

07:11.509 --> 07:12.913
Well, it's not that simple.

07:13.013 --> 07:14.955
Yes, it is. You got me.

07:15.123 --> 07:17.496
All right ? I confess.
I killed Garza.

07:17.693 --> 07:20.164
You're scared, rightfully so,

07:20.263 --> 07:22.417
but I don't think
you understand

07:22.854 --> 07:24.814
the importance
of what I'm asking.

07:24.916 --> 07:27.308
What are you talking about ?!
I...

07:28.244 --> 07:31.298
I'm cooperating, all right ?
What else do you want from me ?

07:32.339 --> 07:33.504
The hourglass ?

07:33.606 --> 07:36.840
You want that... that picture
with the girl on it ? Is that it ?

07:36.951 --> 07:41.206
It  seems I underestimated
your awareness of the situation.

07:41.306 --> 07:44.170
I don't know what they mean.
You can have them. Take'em.

07:44.268 --> 07:47.103
Just let her...
let... let... let her go.

07:47.596 --> 07:48.626
Tell me,

07:49.410 --> 07:51.783
do you believe in déjà vu ?

07:52.593 --> 07:53.902
What... what did you say ?

07:54.011 --> 07:57.633
I'm reminded of another time,
another place...

07:59.038 --> 08:01.219
and a different
detective Hopper.

08:02.204 --> 08:03.991
What are you talking about ?
What...

08:04.188 --> 08:07.030
You see, a long time ago,

08:07.738 --> 08:09.545
I made an error in judgment.

08:09.855 --> 08:11.472
Now it's come back
to haunt me.

08:12.264 --> 08:14.648
You know what that error was,
detective ?

08:15.715 --> 08:16.986
Compassion.

08:17.866 --> 08:20.775
People will promise
anything to avoid pain.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.881
Get away from her. Hey.

08:24.161 --> 08:26.775
Hey, get away from her !
Get away from her !

08:26.942 --> 08:28.138
Get away...
No !

08:28.736 --> 08:30.047
Now remember...

08:30.660 --> 08:32.782
there are other people
you care about...

08:33.114 --> 08:34.640
- Your sister...
- Please, no !

08:34.744 --> 08:37.280
- her children...
- Okay, I'll do whatever you want.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.506
I will do whatever you want.

08:39.604 --> 08:41.366
It's an empty promise.

08:41.630 --> 08:43.293
- No !
- It needs to be clear.

08:43.393 --> 08:44.913
No, no.

08:45.013 --> 08:48.969
You need to understand
just how serious I can be.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.821
No ! Rita, no...

08:52.016 --> 08:52.787
No !

08:53.588 --> 08:54.371
No !

08:55.851 --> 08:56.662
No !

08:57.196 --> 08:59.097
- Rita !
- No !

09:06.113 --> 09:07.125
Rita !

09:13.199 --> 09:15.191
It was hilarious.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.911
So the father stops for a second
to put a new tape in his camcorder.

09:19.011 --> 09:20.953
He was one of those scary,
overinvolved dudes

09:21.057 --> 09:23.840
who probably videotaped
the moment of conception...

09:24.625 --> 09:28.664
so he puts back the tape,
and rushes into the delivery room...

09:29.772 --> 09:31.082
and I'm so boring you.

09:31.192 --> 09:33.587
No, no you're not.
Please keep talking.

09:33.694 --> 09:36.445
No, no, it's okay.
I know my nurse stories

09:36.602 --> 09:39.600
aren't as exciting as, you know,
"tell me where the bomb is."

09:39.785 --> 09:41.595
You scared me.

09:47.207 --> 09:48.203
W hat ?

09:49.646 --> 09:51.470
I'm just really glad
you're here.

09:52.703 --> 09:56.534
Who are you right now and what
did you do with Brett Hopper ?

09:58.113 --> 10:01.311
Okay, so you offer
to drive me to work.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.025
Now we're sitting here
having breakfast.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.987
Is there something
you want to tell me ?

10:09.113 --> 10:10.470
Actually, there is.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.761
I've been working
on this new case,

10:13.908 --> 10:17.060
and it involves
some pretty scary people,

10:17.427 --> 10:21.748
and I'm afraid of what these people
might be willing to do.

10:22.433 --> 10:24.356
So honey, promise me, all right ?

10:24.525 --> 10:27.168
If you ever, and I mean ever,

10:28.033 --> 10:31.847
find yourself in a position where
you cannot get in contact with me,

10:33.292 --> 10:35.691
I need you to call Chad.
He'll keep you safe.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.291
What's... what's that
supposed to mean ?

10:39.708 --> 10:41.312
I know it sounds crazy...

10:41.730 --> 10:42.972
but believe me...

10:50.948 --> 10:53.628
Hey, man, don't ever wake me up
this early again no more, all right ?

10:53.678 --> 10:55.601
- All right, man, thanks.
- All right.

10:58.331 --> 10:59.737
What the hell was that ?

11:00.662 --> 11:01.787
Just a present.

11:06.993 --> 11:07.771
Hey.

11:08.478 --> 11:10.843
Tomorrow night,
behind the dugout.

11:17.396 --> 11:19.944
Gotta get me prints
on this bad boy A.S.A.P.

11:29.041 --> 11:30.589
Done... and done.

11:37.201 --> 11:38.703
Excuse me, lieutenant Graves ?

11:39.244 --> 11:41.196
I have some paperwork here
for you to fill out.

11:41.296 --> 11:43.766
Sorry, not now.
You'll have to put it on my desk.

11:43.865 --> 11:46.469
Captain wants to see me.
Something about Brett Hopper

11:46.571 --> 11:48.331
and this Alberto Garza murder.

11:51.884 --> 11:53.020
I see you.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.257
What ? There are menus...

12:18.642 --> 12:20.900
Hey, where is it ?

12:22.094 --> 12:23.625
- Where's what ?
- The murder book.

12:23.811 --> 12:27.161
D.R. Number 91-118394641.
You have it.

12:27.551 --> 12:28.562
No, I don't.

12:29.114 --> 12:30.204
You're lying.

12:31.079 --> 12:32.630
I'd be careful if I were you.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.884
I need the files
in that book.

12:35.203 --> 12:37.192
What, did you sniff some glue
this morning, Hopper ?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.555
Where did you put it ?

12:38.773 --> 12:40.176
All right,
it's not in your office.

12:40.276 --> 12:42.921
My office, you went through my office ?
You went through my stuff ?

12:43.020 --> 12:45.385
I.A. has classified files.
I can have you arrested for that.

12:45.455 --> 12:47.293
I'm not leaving without it.

12:48.075 --> 12:49.307
Do this the hard way.

12:52.178 --> 12:53.785
I need that book...

12:54.481 --> 12:55.329
now.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.632
Gun.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.298
Gun !

13:05.281 --> 13:06.523
Way to go, genius.

13:09.030 --> 13:09.930
+

13:21.766 --> 13:23.422
All right, guys,
let's hustle up.

13:23.599 --> 13:26.012
S.W.A.T. command at R.H.D.
in five minutes. Let's go.

13:26.162 --> 13:27.346
Hey, let's go.

13:39.051 --> 13:41.636
Hopper's always been a bit
of a bull in a china shop.

13:41.734 --> 13:43.311
Any bad blood
between the two of them ?

13:43.415 --> 13:45.488
You mean other than Hopper
banging Shelton's wife ?

13:45.592 --> 13:46.690
Ex-wife.

13:47.663 --> 13:50.036
Andrea,  this is lieutenant
Romero, S.W.A.T.

13:50.174 --> 13:52.280
Detective Battle.
She's Hopper's current partner.

13:52.379 --> 13:55.492
Your Lt was just telling me about this
Garza business. How much do you know ?

13:55.594 --> 13:57.994
Enough that I can tell
something's not right here.

13:58.211 --> 13:59.079
This isn't Hopper.

13:59.181 --> 14:01.572
Your honest assessment,
how tough is this gonna be ?

14:01.673 --> 14:05.113
Hopper's stubborn, you know ? Sometimes
that's a good thing. Sometimes...

14:05.653 --> 14:07.443
let's just say
I don't envy Shelton.

14:07.553 --> 14:09.707
Stay close. I want you
in the command post.

14:10.575 --> 14:13.521
Okay, Hopper's here
in the I.A. bullpen.

14:14.171 --> 14:17.395
There are exterior windows, but they
don't open. Everything's locked tight.

14:17.496 --> 14:20.830
I've got shooters down each of these
hallways here, here, and here.

14:20.951 --> 14:22.836
There's only one way out,
and that's through us.

14:22.887 --> 14:24.745
Okay, Hopper's not dumb.
He knows what's coming.

14:24.814 --> 14:26.315
Then we won't disappoint him.

14:26.618 --> 14:27.916
All we gon'do is talk.

14:28.086 --> 14:30.230
I like to talk.
Ask my last two wives.

14:30.379 --> 14:33.374
99 out of 100 times,
that's all a person wants.

14:33.648 --> 14:35.264
And what about
the one person who doesn't ?

14:35.317 --> 14:36.779
I've been doing this
a long time.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.685
We don't explore other options
until my jaw falls off.

14:39.873 --> 14:42.714
Says here we'll have eyes and ears
on Hopper in a couple of minutes.

14:42.817 --> 14:45.383
I want to put my men in these halls.
Nothing personal.

14:45.481 --> 14:48.430
Don't want anybody getting nervous,
going all cowboy on us.

14:48.812 --> 14:50.428
So has anyone tried
to call Hopper yet ?

14:50.488 --> 14:52.499
Yes. He's not
answering his phone.

14:53.221 --> 14:54.731
Typical Hopper.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.144
You gonna pick it up,
or what ?

15:05.728 --> 15:09.492
Hello. You know they're just gonna keep
letting it ring until somebody answers.

15:09.592 --> 15:12.301
I know the protocol.
Get demands,

15:12.641 --> 15:13.963
kill the A.C.,

15:14.198 --> 15:16.444
- eyes and ears...
- What ?!

15:16.623 --> 15:18.029
Hopper, it's Graves.

15:18.406 --> 15:20.569
I'm gonna hand you over
to S.W.A.T. lieutenant Romero.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.238
He's been doing this
20 years, so...

15:22.339 --> 15:23.598
All right, put him on.

15:29.138 --> 15:30.621
<i>Everybody okay
in there, Hopper ?</i>

15:30.721 --> 15:34.447
Yeah, well, Chad's ego's a bit bruised,
but I think he'll be just fine.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.037
<i>- How about you ? You okay ?</i>
- I've had better days.

15:37.137 --> 15:41.217
Look, I know you're wanted for Garza's
murder, so I won't sugarcoat this.

15:41.645 --> 15:44.104
I've got 10 S.W.A.T. guys,
about 40 cops, two snipers

15:44.214 --> 15:45.886
and  one meat wagon
out here, Hopper.

15:45.989 --> 15:47.776
Give me a reason
to send the meat wagon home.

15:47.879 --> 15:49.676
Okay, send'em home, then.

15:49.902 --> 15:51.672
We can forget this whole thing
ever happened.

15:51.771 --> 15:52.954
Love to, but I can't.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.622
But you have a lot of people out here
who really love and care about you...

15:55.673 --> 15:57.887
Who care about me, who wanna
see me get through this alive.

15:57.939 --> 16:00.935
Whatever, man. Let's just
get to it. All right, now...

16:01.603 --> 16:02.883
these are my demands.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.309
All right.

16:04.526 --> 16:06.662
I wanna see
my girlfriend Rita Shelton

16:07.538 --> 16:11.743
and my sister Jennifer Mathis
with her kids, brought here.

16:12.189 --> 16:14.055
- Anything else ?
- No. That's it.

16:14.798 --> 16:17.804
Bring them here so I can see them,
and know that they're safe.

16:18.817 --> 16:19.887
That's it.

16:24.225 --> 16:26.140
Found the murder weapon
in Hopper's closet.

16:26.238 --> 16:27.224
Yeah, I heard.

16:28.207 --> 16:29.985
Hey, look, pretend
you're a cop for a second.

16:30.084 --> 16:31.204
Okay, but it's a stretch.

16:31.302 --> 16:33.792
- Just pretend that you killed Garza.
- I can do that.

16:33.891 --> 16:36.025
Now would you hide the murder
weapon in your closet ?

16:36.087 --> 16:36.843
No.

16:36.923 --> 16:39.498
Would you stroll into a police station
afterward and take a guy hostage ?

16:39.550 --> 16:41.674
I see what you're getting at,
but you're forgetting something.

16:41.717 --> 16:43.642
- What's that ?
- People are stupid.

16:43.742 --> 16:45.541
This is a D-2
we're talking about here, man.

16:45.610 --> 16:47.469
Other than us, how many people
on the whole force knew

16:47.511 --> 16:49.109
that Hopper was
being taken down ?

16:49.382 --> 16:51.849
- Maybe a half dozen.
- Exactly. Hopper knows the drill,

16:51.959 --> 16:54.998
knows that word wouldn't go wide
until late this afternoon.

16:57.694 --> 16:59.965
Well, so he's smart enough
to know that, but stupid enough

17:00.063 --> 17:03.453
to pull a gun on a cop in a police
station ?'Cause that makes sense.

17:03.921 --> 17:05.480
Who'd he take hostage,
anyway ?

17:05.694 --> 17:07.348
Shelton in I.A.

17:07.863 --> 17:10.496
Really ? Looks like christmas
came early this year.

17:11.859 --> 17:13.303
You know you're wasting
your time.

17:13.405 --> 17:16.622
S.W.A.T.'s wiring the place.
You're never gonna find anything.

17:17.644 --> 17:18.980
Hey, sit down.

17:19.140 --> 17:22.223
At least put the cuffs in front.
I'm losing circulation here.

17:28.357 --> 17:30.134
What was all that crap
about Rita and your sister,

17:30.189 --> 17:31.786
all you want's
the murder book, huh ?

17:31.887 --> 17:33.251
That's between me and you.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.085
I don't trust any of the cops
in this place.

17:35.147 --> 17:37.329
Why were you looking into
one of my father's old cases ?

17:37.380 --> 17:39.563
I told you I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.652
I.A. pulls old files
all the time.

17:41.716 --> 17:44.177
I can't remember half the crap
I sign off on. It's standard procedure.

17:44.227 --> 17:46.591
Get it, or should I talk slower ?

17:49.418 --> 17:52.002
You want the book,
why don't you just ask for it ?

17:53.827 --> 17:55.340
Why use Rita as leverage ?

17:55.862 --> 18:00.010
- Hey, she's not leverage.
- The worst part is, she's gonna come

18:00.111 --> 18:03.049
- running right in here to save you...
- Do I need to gag you ?

18:03.600 --> 18:05.543
You don't deserve her.
You never did.

18:06.755 --> 18:09.285
That ship sailed
a long time ago, Chad.

18:11.425 --> 18:12.651
Let it go.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.284
Picture's up.

18:17.871 --> 18:20.975
I know it's hard to watch a friend
do something this irrational.

18:22.178 --> 18:25.915
If Hopper pulled a gun on Chad Shelton,
he did it for a rational reason.

18:27.415 --> 18:29.997
Gonna see how we're doing
on Rita and his sister.

18:31.308 --> 18:33.079
Ballistics are a match.
The gun in Hopper's closet

18:33.131 --> 18:35.273
-  is the same one that killed Garza.
- What about the prints ?

18:35.317 --> 18:36.702
The lab's backed up.

18:36.899 --> 18:38.964
Roknowski has some rush job.

18:39.066 --> 18:41.431
Any chance we might
get audio in my lifetime ?

18:46.846 --> 18:47.953
We got sound.

18:48.051 --> 18:49.169
<i>... bring her in.</i>

18:51.168 --> 18:54.110
Hopper's sister and her kids are en
route, but there's no word on Rita yet.

18:54.191 --> 18:56.583
If you really give a damn about Rita,
you'd keep her out of it.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.705
I'm trying to protect her.

18:57.808 --> 18:59.901
- You're bringing her into harm's way.
- Hey, sit down.

18:59.963 --> 19:03.422
- You want to see her hurt. Is that it ?
- Get your ass back in that chair !

19:07.205 --> 19:08.707
If you give up now,
they'll bring her in.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.905
- I can't do that.
- You would

19:09.946 --> 19:12.658
- if you really cared about her.
- If I get caught, she gets killed.

19:12.660 --> 19:14.778
- Is that some kind of threat ?
- No, there are people after me.

19:14.782 --> 19:16.071
- They'll kill her.
- What people ?

19:16.074 --> 19:17.914
- I don't know.
- You don't know'cause you're a liar.

19:17.964 --> 19:19.793
- I'm not lying. I've seen it.
- You've seen Jack...

19:19.853 --> 19:21.700
- I've seen it happen !
- I'm not listening to any more...

19:21.704 --> 19:23.553
I've seen Rita die !

19:24.581 --> 19:27.282
I have seen
Rita die three times.

19:31.323 --> 19:33.326
If I get caught,
she gets killed.

19:33.493 --> 19:37.046
- What the hell are you talking about ?
- I'm living this day over and over.

19:37.147 --> 19:38.524
If I get caught,

19:39.515 --> 19:40.806
Rita will die...

19:41.204 --> 19:42.244
again.

19:48.922 --> 19:49.887
Yeah.

19:50.325 --> 19:51.614
This is gonna end well.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.560
+

20:05.095 --> 20:06.382
This is perfect.

20:06.686 --> 20:08.188
It's just so you.

20:09.296 --> 20:12.398
Basically, the whole world,
the very concept of time,

20:12.403 --> 20:14.518
revolves around Brett Hopper,

20:14.548 --> 20:16.790
'cause you're so special.

20:18.846 --> 20:20.924
Man, and people say I got an ego.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.819
I know how it sounds,
but it's the truth.

20:24.666 --> 20:26.918
So every morning at quarter past 6,

20:26.922 --> 20:28.376
Rita, Andrea,

20:28.390 --> 20:31.166
all these people who've died
the previous day they're all alive again ?

20:34.659 --> 20:36.670
Well, if there's some
cosmic reset button,

20:36.674 --> 20:38.059
why waste time with civility ?

20:38.075 --> 20:40.477
Why not just march on in here,
machine guns blazing,

20:40.484 --> 20:42.070
perforate us all,
take what you want ?

20:42.082 --> 20:43.976
Gee, I don't know...

20:44.155 --> 20:46.185
maybe because it's wrong ?

20:47.253 --> 20:49.348
Why don't you just give up now
and start again tomorrow ?

20:49.354 --> 20:51.160
I can't do that.

20:51.866 --> 20:54.395
- Why ?
- Didn't you just hear a word I said ?

20:54.780 --> 20:57.193
I've seen Rita die three times.

20:59.232 --> 21:00.540
Imagine

21:00.988 --> 21:03.042
seeing her executed...

21:05.208 --> 21:06.937
hearing the gunshot

21:07.048 --> 21:09.010
that takes her life...

21:09.658 --> 21:11.424
hearing her screaming.

21:11.633 --> 21:14.053
Would you want to live through that
over and over again ?

21:15.275 --> 21:16.968
I can't un-see that...

21:19.611 --> 21:21.621
and you know what
the scariest thing is ?

21:22.748 --> 21:24.766
I don't know when tomorrow's gonna come.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.016
What if this day stops repeating ?

21:28.260 --> 21:30.282
I get caught, and she dies,

21:30.285 --> 21:32.026
and then tomorrow comes

21:32.758 --> 21:34.115
and she's gone...

21:35.137 --> 21:36.130
forever.

21:41.179 --> 21:43.008
Would you take that chance ?

21:52.479 --> 21:54.717
Thanks for coming in, Mrs. Mathis.

21:54.733 --> 21:56.912
We just want to ask you
a few questions about your brother.

21:56.926 --> 21:58.535
Of course.
Anything I can do.

21:58.547 --> 21:59.799
You know, I...

21:59.928 --> 22:01.957
I knew your father back in the day.

22:02.260 --> 22:03.577
He was a good man.

22:04.013 --> 22:05.094
Thank you.

22:05.606 --> 22:07.397
It was a real shame what happened.

22:11.476 --> 22:14.050
Yeah, it took us all by surprise.

22:14.911 --> 22:16.035
So...

22:16.157 --> 22:18.233
you're close to your brother ?

22:19.158 --> 22:20.169
Very close.

22:20.174 --> 22:22.836
Great, and if he were going
through a difficult time,

22:22.849 --> 22:25.388
- he'd confide in you ?
- You know, it's hard to say.

22:26.110 --> 22:28.917
I mean, you get it
the whole stoic cop thing.

22:30.070 --> 22:31.965
He's very much like our dad that way.

22:32.356 --> 22:34.949
Nothing ever seems to faze them,
and then...

22:35.997 --> 22:37.517
you know, one day...

22:40.256 --> 22:42.485
Has your brother ever
expressed any ideas

22:42.501 --> 22:45.383
that you'd describe as paranoid
or conspiratorial ?

22:47.793 --> 22:49.909
- Conspiratorial ?
- Yeah.

22:50.402 --> 22:51.088
No.

22:51.593 --> 22:52.921
What are you implying ?

22:52.935 --> 22:55.519
- We're just trying to determine...
- no, you're implying that

22:55.534 --> 22:58.043
Brett is doing all this
because of a history of mental illness

22:58.057 --> 22:59.538
in our family.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.675
I'd like to see my brother now.

23:14.918 --> 23:15.669
Yeah.

23:16.510 --> 23:18.182
I've got somebody who wants
to speak to you.

23:18.185 --> 23:18.833
<i>Hi.</i>

23:20.230 --> 23:21.730
Remember what we talked about.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.728
Hey, Brett. It's me.

23:26.780 --> 23:27.995
<i>Jen, are you okay ?</i>

23:28.169 --> 23:30.343
- I'm fine.
- And the kids ? How are the kids ?

23:30.550 --> 23:32.588
<i>- They're safe. We're all here.</i>
- Okay, okay.

23:33.006 --> 23:35.293
<i>We all want
what's best for you, Brett.</i>

23:35.400 --> 23:37.288
We want you and...

23:37.369 --> 23:39.107
and Chad to get out safely.

23:45.346 --> 23:47.682
- Satisfied ?
<i>- Did you find Rita yet ?</i>

23:50.297 --> 23:51.855
We're still working on it.

23:52.567 --> 23:53.908
<i>Look, Hopper,</i>

23:54.219 --> 23:55.787
we had an agreement.

23:55.859 --> 23:58.358
I came through for you.
Your sister is safe.

23:58.698 --> 24:01.176
<i>- Now I showed good faith...</i>
- I know where this is going.

24:02.676 --> 24:05.471
<i>I'll give you Chad
when you bring me Rita Shelton.</i>

24:07.547 --> 24:10.624
Let's get another camera in
there right now. Move ! Move !

24:14.876 --> 24:16.147
What are you thinking ?

24:16.152 --> 24:17.959
I have concerns that Hopper
has a different agenda

24:17.975 --> 24:19.531
than he's been telling us.

24:19.545 --> 24:20.940
You think he's saying good-bye.

24:20.955 --> 24:23.629
- I've seen it enough times.
- That's ridiculous.

24:23.651 --> 24:26.092
He's concerned about his girlfriend
because we can't find her.

24:26.097 --> 24:28.002
What if we do, we bring her in,

24:28.189 --> 24:30.418
- then what ?
- What if we find her and she's dead ?

24:31.955 --> 24:33.411
Thank you, detective.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.245
Let's take the A.C. Out in there.

24:37.568 --> 24:39.632
I don't want Hopper to get
too comfortable.

24:39.839 --> 24:41.588
- You were shot ?
- Yes.

24:41.766 --> 24:43.461
- When was this ?
- Today.

24:43.924 --> 24:45.610
- I mean, like...
- How many "todays" ago ?

24:45.624 --> 24:47.688
I don't know. I lost track.

24:48.060 --> 24:50.501
Your wounds carry over even
though no one else's do ?

24:50.512 --> 24:52.889
Yep, except for the bandages.

24:52.902 --> 24:54.490
I gotta patch this up every day.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.898
So you get shot, you can die.

24:57.793 --> 24:59.879
- I'm guessing, yeah.
- Good to know.

24:59.882 --> 25:01.624
While you're over there
cracking yourself up,

25:01.629 --> 25:03.514
you realize they still
haven't found Rita.

25:03.528 --> 25:05.412
For all I know,
they already got her.

25:05.464 --> 25:06.746
They'll find her.

25:10.396 --> 25:11.683
You hear that ?

25:12.043 --> 25:13.593
Yeah, they killed the air.

25:13.606 --> 25:15.289
I hate this part.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.878
Gotta say, even though you're
riding on the short bus,

25:18.891 --> 25:20.785
I applaud your attention to detail.

25:20.791 --> 25:23.710
Swapping the cell phone battery,
the girl at the pool,

25:23.877 --> 25:26.031
the bus and margo, is it ?

25:26.112 --> 25:27.344
It's good stuff.

25:27.963 --> 25:29.838
What comes after the bus thing ?

25:30.651 --> 25:32.113
I'm serious.
I want to know.

25:33.295 --> 25:35.268
I go to my mailbox
and I get a package.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.658
And what's in it ?

25:40.806 --> 25:42.008
Evidence...

25:44.507 --> 25:46.209
something that might clear me.

25:59.814 --> 26:01.652
Hey, hi.

26:02.181 --> 26:04.040
- Hi.
- hi.

26:18.389 --> 26:20.075
Who in the hell is calling him ?

26:21.527 --> 26:23.230
- Yeah.
- Before you say one word to me,

26:23.234 --> 26:25.204
they still got ears
on you in that room.

26:25.219 --> 26:28.380
For the record, you sound like
a complete whack job.

26:28.382 --> 26:30.738
Yeah, well, I got more important
things to worry about right now.

26:30.753 --> 26:33.348
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be so sure.
They've got you on suicide watch.

26:33.360 --> 26:33.845
What ?

26:33.861 --> 26:36.146
<i>Listen, there's a suction mike
on the window, west side of the room.</i>

26:36.162 --> 26:37.834
<i>Lift up the blind.
You'll see it.</i>

26:38.107 --> 26:40.097
Oh, and you might also
notice the half-dozen snipers

26:40.112 --> 26:42.535
waiting to ventilate
your bughouse of a brain.

26:42.950 --> 26:44.107
Get in the chair.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.881
Hurry up, get in the chair.

26:55.658 --> 26:57.007
Where the hell is my picture ?

27:01.874 --> 27:04.191
- He's losing it.
- I need you to do something for me.

27:06.898 --> 27:09.264
- I need three guys. Move, move !
- Yes, sir.

27:13.583 --> 27:14.258
so...

27:14.764 --> 27:16.668
let's just say that you're not
completely nuts.

27:17.690 --> 27:18.643
Let's...

27:19.665 --> 27:22.019
posit the notion that you could be
living the same day

27:22.024 --> 27:24.109
over and over.
How is that possible,

27:24.268 --> 27:27.052
what with the laws of physics and all ?

27:27.059 --> 27:30.161
You're not gonna start with
that Discovery Channel stuff, are you ?

27:30.251 --> 27:32.211
You know, in these last few
wonderful hours,

27:32.217 --> 27:34.591
my thoughts have alternated between

27:34.606 --> 27:36.837
why you'd be trapped in the same day

27:37.865 --> 27:40.930
and the most painful way
I could kill you when I get my hands free.

27:42.653 --> 27:44.046
I'm thinking about this theory
I read about

27:44.072 --> 27:46.003
in an actual book, Hopper,

27:46.020 --> 27:48.007
time as a texture.

27:48.021 --> 27:50.615
Sometimes it's smooth,
sometimes it's soft...

27:51.496 --> 27:53.483
but other times, it can be sticky.

27:53.737 --> 27:55.297
- Sticky ?
- Yeah.

27:55.655 --> 27:57.119
Maybe you're stuck.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.952
And here I thought you'd blame it
on all the tree huggers

27:58.966 --> 28:00.388
like you do everything else.

28:00.393 --> 28:03.188
Or maybe it's more rooted
in quantum physics.

28:03.404 --> 28:06.068
You ever read "Mobius transformations
and the doppler shift,"

28:06.697 --> 28:09.175
or "spacetime mediation
of quantum interactions"?

28:09.217 --> 28:10.583
This is so you.

28:11.394 --> 28:13.509
- What ?
- Just like back in the day,

28:14.168 --> 28:15.706
always showing off that education,

28:15.711 --> 28:18.084
like all these plaques
you got up in your office.

28:18.472 --> 28:19.973
I'm not showing off.

28:20.871 --> 28:22.063
You know, forget my theories.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.971
Maybe your mom just dropped
you on your head too many times

28:23.978 --> 28:25.240
when you were a kid.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.691
At least I put some thought into it.

28:40.531 --> 28:42.156
Why do you think it's happening ?

28:42.440 --> 28:43.883
You gotta have some theories.

28:43.895 --> 28:45.771
It's irresponsible not to.

28:46.104 --> 28:47.324
I don't know.

28:48.903 --> 28:51.247
At first I thought it was because
I was injected with that...

28:51.263 --> 28:52.255
that drug, but...

28:52.269 --> 28:54.881
I'm not talking physical,
"how" it's happening.

28:54.897 --> 28:56.656
I'm talking the metaphysical "why".

28:56.672 --> 28:58.508
Well, maybe it's not about why.

28:58.521 --> 29:00.321
Maybe things just happen to people.

29:00.526 --> 29:02.210
Maybe you were chosen.

29:03.105 --> 29:04.653
No, I...

29:04.737 --> 29:06.939
I definitely have not been chosen.

29:07.164 --> 29:09.412
Well, then how do you explain it,
Buck Rogers ?

29:09.425 --> 29:11.972
In your gut,
what does it feel like it is ?

29:12.928 --> 29:14.899
I feel like I'm being punished.

29:18.230 --> 29:19.461
Punished...

29:22.671 --> 29:23.778
for what ?

29:29.250 --> 29:32.005
Maybe you're the victim of
some government conspiracy, huh ?

29:32.022 --> 29:34.214
I hear they've been doing
some experiments...

29:34.227 --> 29:35.343
- on stupid cops.
- Sit down.

29:35.349 --> 29:37.139
- That would explain a lot.
- Sit down.

29:37.335 --> 29:38.548
Sit down.

29:41.811 --> 29:44.428
- Initiate, now !
- Move, move, move !

29:48.570 --> 29:49.290
+

29:54.374 --> 29:56.184
Jackson, stand down !

29:56.188 --> 29:58.167
- Get the hell back !
- Stand down !

29:58.181 --> 29:59.884
You, get back.

30:06.066 --> 30:07.922
- What the hell was that ?
- Is everyone okay ?

30:07.927 --> 30:10.788
Shut up, shut up !
I'm only dealing with Andrea Battle.

30:13.134 --> 30:14.694
I should blow your head off.

30:14.707 --> 30:16.861
- You tried to kill me !
- I saved your ass. A thank you would be fine.

30:16.864 --> 30:18.799
You stop lying !
Stop lying !

30:18.810 --> 30:22.088
That sniper was gonna put a bullet in
your head, but I pushed you out of the way.

30:23.541 --> 30:25.741
Guy had a. 45. Real bullets.

30:25.756 --> 30:28.550
Shoot to kill.
That's not protocol.

30:30.138 --> 30:33.222
They should have entered non-lethal...

30:34.941 --> 30:36.530
flash-bangs and...

30:37.312 --> 30:39.579
- bean bag rounds.
- The second team did.

30:41.234 --> 30:42.409
Why'd you do it ?

30:43.709 --> 30:45.287
To save your ass ?

30:46.594 --> 30:48.845
Well, you may be all psycho right now,

30:48.857 --> 30:51.214
but we were friends once, partners.

30:52.108 --> 30:54.014
I didn't want to see you
go out like that.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.667
Yeah, we were partners,

30:57.931 --> 31:00.239
but we weren't, uh...
I mean...

31:02.381 --> 31:04.526
we rode together
every day for two years.

31:08.769 --> 31:11.324
Fine. Whatever way you wanna put it.

31:12.539 --> 31:15.679
By the way, you owe me $171
and 53 cents.

31:15.741 --> 31:16.578
What ?

31:16.950 --> 31:19.100
I bought coffee twice
as much as you did.

31:19.566 --> 31:21.385
About time you paid your debts.

31:22.636 --> 31:23.983
You kept a tab ?

31:24.949 --> 31:25.996
I'm thorough.

31:26.451 --> 31:28.387
It's what makes me good at what I do.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.501
Here you go.
The print was in the system.

31:32.503 --> 31:34.964
- Hopper. Isn't that the...
- Thank you.

31:38.219 --> 31:39.940
Hopper will only talk to you.

31:39.945 --> 31:40.768
Come on.

31:44.895 --> 31:46.443
I've got a solution.

31:48.071 --> 31:50.914
If everyone you care about
is in trouble because of you,

31:50.929 --> 31:52.494
why don't you take yourself
out of the equation ?

31:52.500 --> 31:54.309
- What are you talking about ?
- Kill yourself.

31:54.323 --> 31:57.088
Seems to me if you die,
everyone else will be fine.

31:58.523 --> 32:00.916
- Oh, see, you're not getting off that easy.
- Pretty please ?

32:00.939 --> 32:03.601
I can't, not if I can change the day.

32:03.913 --> 32:05.454
What about Rita ?

32:05.688 --> 32:07.688
You're saying you could do something
to change her situation ?

32:07.691 --> 32:08.463
Maybe.

32:09.822 --> 32:11.771
What about the guys
that are after Rita ?

32:11.785 --> 32:14.651
- What do they want from you, anyway ?
- They wanna me to confess to Garza's murder.

32:14.662 --> 32:16.099
- So confess.
- I did,

32:17.214 --> 32:19.491
but they said that
I didn't take them seriously.

32:19.527 --> 32:21.353
What could be more serious
than taking a cop hostage

32:21.359 --> 32:23.895
in a police station to save
the woman you love, huh ?

32:26.978 --> 32:28.960
Come on, man,
what kind of cop are you ?

32:29.607 --> 32:32.527
All these days, you haven't figured
out one way to contact these guys ?

32:35.493 --> 32:37.148
You remember Baxter, right ?

32:45.959 --> 32:47.277
Yo, Hop.

32:47.616 --> 32:49.480
Been looking for you, man.

32:49.544 --> 32:51.149
Damien, I need to speak to Baxter.

32:51.875 --> 32:52.821
Baxter.

32:53.561 --> 32:56.645
Well, if I see that fed,
I'll pass word along.

32:56.958 --> 32:59.831
Well, that should be easy,'cause I know
he's stuffed in the back of your truck.

33:17.328 --> 33:18.446
It's for you.

33:18.467 --> 33:19.519
It's Hopper.

33:20.197 --> 33:21.685
<i>- Hopper ?</i>
- Baxter, listen good,

33:21.702 --> 33:23.632
because I only have time
to tell you this once.

33:23.647 --> 33:25.639
Now you gotta follow
my exact instructions,

33:25.890 --> 33:28.401
or Damien will kill you.
Do you understand me ?

33:28.415 --> 33:30.022
<i>- Yes.</i>
- All right, now I know about the guys

33:30.033 --> 33:31.949
who've been squeezing you,
in the blue Sedan.

33:31.962 --> 33:33.970
<i>I need you to contact them
for me and tell them</i>

33:33.975 --> 33:35.965
I will give them whatever they want.

33:35.980 --> 33:39.389
Okay ? I will confess,
but only if they let Rita go.

33:39.578 --> 33:41.030
All right, you got that ?

33:41.046 --> 33:41.863
Yes.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.265
<i>You also gotta tell them</i>

33:43.268 --> 33:45.596
now this is really important--listen--

33:45.879 --> 33:48.234
I know how serious this is.

33:48.249 --> 33:50.573
I understand how serious this is.

33:50.634 --> 33:52.154
<i>Repeat that back to me.</i>

33:52.859 --> 33:54.899
You understand how serious this is.

33:54.950 --> 33:55.799
All right.

33:56.418 --> 33:58.544
Now, Baxter, if you screw me on this,

33:59.084 --> 34:00.238
you will die.

34:03.967 --> 34:05.524
I need to make a call.

34:08.424 --> 34:09.917
Detective Battle's here.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.143
Thanks for coming, detective.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.619
Rita Shelton's car was just found
on Cahuenga Boulevard...

34:13.634 --> 34:15.891
keys still in the ignition,
she's nowhere to be found.

34:15.896 --> 34:17.168
What do you need me to do ?

34:19.763 --> 34:21.561
- Yeah.
- Hey, Hopper.

34:21.947 --> 34:23.966
- Heard you missed me.
- Did you get it ?

34:25.239 --> 34:27.379
That thing you asked about...

34:27.730 --> 34:29.931
matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez.

34:29.995 --> 34:31.775
He's been in Pelican bay since'89,

34:31.777 --> 34:33.804
serving five consecutive life sentences,

34:33.822 --> 34:35.809
so there's no way

34:35.824 --> 34:38.277
he could've killed anyone in'91,
let alone Garza.

34:40.132 --> 34:41.824
I thought they were connected.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.801
What about Rita ?

34:47.949 --> 34:49.360
He deserves to know the truth.

34:49.366 --> 34:51.797
No, it's the only card we have.

34:57.307 --> 34:59.231
They found her car.
She's missing.

35:01.890 --> 35:03.268
That was irresponsible.

35:03.274 --> 35:05.589
You might've just cost us
two lives in there.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.077
Now get out.

35:10.314 --> 35:11.516
We're ending this now.

35:11.529 --> 35:13.196
This is all your fault !

35:13.266 --> 35:15.514
All you had to do was give
me the murder book.

35:15.531 --> 35:18.516
You come storming on in here...
did you even think to look in cold case...

35:18.530 --> 35:20.943
you know, where they keep
the unsolved murder books ?

35:20.956 --> 35:22.496
You didn't even look, did you ?

35:22.511 --> 35:24.415
No, I didn't go down there,'cause you told me

35:24.440 --> 35:26.506
it was in that damn filing
cabinet right there.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.022
- I never said that.
- Yes, you did.

35:28.025 --> 35:29.507
- When ?
- Today.

35:32.054 --> 35:33.163
Yesterday.

35:38.768 --> 35:41.014
How the hell am I gonna get down there ?

35:41.480 --> 35:43.442
How am I gonna get the murder book ?

35:57.736 --> 35:59.401
Looks like your time is up.

36:03.750 --> 36:04.955
Yours, too.

36:07.297 --> 36:08.741
Don't shoot !

36:09.573 --> 36:12.129
- Don't shoot. We're coming out.
- If I die, he dies.

36:14.010 --> 36:16.598
If I die, he dies.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.160
+

36:28.713 --> 36:30.682
Did I ever tell you about our honeymoon ?

36:34.496 --> 36:36.535
Rita and I were on our way to Vegas.

36:36.549 --> 36:38.154
It was a saturday night.

36:38.784 --> 36:41.588
I had this big special dinner planned,

36:42.744 --> 36:44.475
and there was this dog...

36:45.439 --> 36:47.228
thing got nailed on the 15.

36:48.546 --> 36:49.939
It was this mangy stray.

36:49.955 --> 36:52.129
It was all bloody,
on its last legs...

36:53.350 --> 36:56.012
and meanwhile,
I got bottles of Dom on ice,

36:57.003 --> 37:00.347
a 7-course feast, violins,
the whole shot.

37:01.462 --> 37:02.993
Rita had to stop,

37:03.354 --> 37:05.085
had to try to save the thing, huh ?

37:07.850 --> 37:09.506
Hopper, where you going ?

37:09.511 --> 37:12.067
Took a while, but I finally
convinced her we had to go.

37:12.561 --> 37:14.654
She was just so torn up over it.

37:16.436 --> 37:18.320
That's when I knew...
that's...

37:19.303 --> 37:21.071
that's when I knew I'd made
the right decision,

37:21.087 --> 37:22.999
that this was the woman for me.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.225
Hopper, you are leaving us no choice.

37:26.224 --> 37:28.004
A woman with that much heart...

37:30.714 --> 37:33.029
you know, the only reason
she's with you

37:33.045 --> 37:34.948
is she pities you, Hopper.

37:35.463 --> 37:36.713
Is that right ?

37:37.304 --> 37:38.822
She's a rescuer.

37:39.133 --> 37:41.431
She needs things she can save.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.157
That why she married you ?

37:43.171 --> 37:45.094
No, that's why it didn't work out.

37:45.254 --> 37:46.736
I don't need saving.

37:46.799 --> 37:47.925
Never did.

37:48.179 --> 37:50.052
I was fine just the way I was.

37:50.067 --> 37:52.548
- Stop right there, Hopper.
- I ain't going nowhere.

37:53.080 --> 37:56.279
- I'm just trying to get to cold case.
- You promised to release chad

37:56.953 --> 37:58.791
if we brought your sister
and Rita Shelton.

37:58.803 --> 38:00.383
Yeah, and you failed.

38:15.617 --> 38:17.155
Rita, did they hurt you ?

38:17.191 --> 38:18.516
Are you okay ?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.376
- I'm all right.
- Okay.

38:22.416 --> 38:24.666
- Okay.
- We need to know

38:24.680 --> 38:27.790
that you are a man of your word.

38:28.123 --> 38:30.304
We need to know
how serious you are.

38:31.001 --> 38:34.695
I don't think you understand
the seriousness of what I'm asking.

38:38.306 --> 38:39.982
You see that ?
You see that ?

38:42.324 --> 38:42.954
Yeah.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.585
Now we kept our part of the deal.

38:48.561 --> 38:50.244
I need you to keep yours.

38:52.136 --> 38:53.492
I confess.

38:54.239 --> 38:56.638
I confess to killing Alberto Garza.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.155
All right ? I did it.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.173
You hear me ?

39:01.227 --> 39:02.318
Okay.

39:03.778 --> 39:04.841
Okay.

39:05.629 --> 39:08.128
Okay. Hey, had.

39:09.342 --> 39:11.369
- Yeah ?
- Just so you know,

39:12.728 --> 39:14.640
it was never loaded.

39:21.607 --> 39:23.158
Move, move, move !

39:30.250 --> 39:31.528
Hey, don't worry...

39:31.812 --> 39:33.545
I'll look out for her.

39:34.707 --> 39:36.046
Oh and if you're right...

39:36.475 --> 39:38.350
the book's in the front seat of my car.

39:38.361 --> 39:41.687
Brett Hopper, you're under arrest for
the murder of assistant D.A. Alberto garza.

39:42.141 --> 39:44.439
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent,

39:44.451 --> 39:47.535
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.
