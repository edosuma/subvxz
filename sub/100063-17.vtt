00:42.901 --> 00:44.278
Mrs. Yang,

00:44.302 --> 00:46.481
- Thomas Magnum.
- I'm Juliet Higgins. Hi.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.815
We spoke on the phone earlier.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.283
What are the police doing here?

00:49.307 --> 00:50.752
Well, you said your husband was taken,

00:50.776 --> 00:53.554
and in these circumstances, we
think it's best to involve HPD.

00:53.578 --> 00:55.556
Ma'am, I'm Detective Katsumoto.
May we come in, please?

00:55.580 --> 00:57.614
- Uh, yes, of course.
- Thank you.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.829
When was your husband taken?

01:01.853 --> 01:05.032
Last night. I think somebody
came in through that door.

01:05.056 --> 01:06.501
Get CSU down here.

01:06.525 --> 01:07.902
Have them dust that door for prints.

01:07.926 --> 01:09.504
Where'd you see him last?

01:09.528 --> 01:10.671
Right over there.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.240
In this room?

01:12.264 --> 01:15.031
Yes. Up there.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.535
Up on the shelf?

01:18.889 --> 01:20.055
Mm-hmm.

01:25.577 --> 01:27.388
Mrs. Yang, was there, by any chance,

01:27.412 --> 01:30.484
an urn on this shelf that
contained your husband's ashes?

01:30.508 --> 01:33.795
Yes. My husband's been dead
for ten years now.

01:33.819 --> 01:35.318
I see.

01:36.688 --> 01:38.065
Um...

01:38.665 --> 01:40.668
Could you give us a moment, please?

01:40.692 --> 01:43.037
Sure. I'll go put some coffee on.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.938
That's very kind, thank you.

01:47.465 --> 01:49.443
You said there had been an abduction.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.264
Don't look at me. Magnum took the call.

01:51.288 --> 01:53.281
She called in a panic,
said she needed a P.I.

01:53.305 --> 01:55.516
and that her husband had been taken.

01:55.540 --> 01:56.751
What was I supposed to assume?

01:56.775 --> 01:58.511
Make sure you take a B and E statement.

02:03.715 --> 02:05.827
What? How was I supposed to know?

02:05.851 --> 02:08.295
So, you guys got this one, right?

02:08.320 --> 02:10.364
Yes. Yes, this... we got it.

02:10.388 --> 02:11.823
Okay.

02:13.391 --> 02:16.662
Well, uh, technically, it...

02:17.062 --> 02:19.206
it is still a missing persons case.

02:20.765 --> 02:28.765
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

02:41.304 --> 02:43.231
Could you describe the urn?

02:43.730 --> 02:46.200
It's made of brushed silver.

02:46.224 --> 02:49.170
Maybe about ten inches tall.

02:49.194 --> 02:51.661
I-I think I have a picture
where you can see it.

02:57.723 --> 02:59.256
Thank you.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.951
And you're certain they didn't
steal anything else?

03:03.975 --> 03:05.753
Just my Richard.

03:05.777 --> 03:08.289
I don't understand why someone
would want to take him.

03:08.839 --> 03:10.458
It is made of silver.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.049
I suppose somebody could
pawn it off or melt it down.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.264
That urn was all I had left of him.

03:18.423 --> 03:21.202
A few years ago, I had a house fire.

03:21.226 --> 03:24.338
I only had time to grab
one thing, and of course I...

03:24.362 --> 03:26.696
You took your husband. Of course.

03:28.466 --> 03:30.068
I lost everything else.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.979
Photos,

03:32.003 --> 03:34.882
cards, mementos.

03:35.699 --> 03:39.787
All I had left were
memories and that urn.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.712
Well, we will do whatever we can
to get it back to you.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.182
Yeah, that's a promise.

03:47.218 --> 03:48.829
Thoughts?

03:48.853 --> 03:50.698
Stolen property case, not much value.

03:50.722 --> 03:53.701
Could be a drug addict
looking for a quick flip.

03:53.725 --> 03:56.037
Yeah, odd, though, that they
left several items behind

03:56.061 --> 03:57.238
of greater value.

03:57.262 --> 03:59.006
I guess it's easier
to steal a ten-inch urn

03:59.030 --> 04:00.675
than a 50-inch flat-screen.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.910
Unfortunately for our client,
even if we do manage

04:02.934 --> 04:05.279
to recover the urn, the
likelihood of that bag of ashes

04:05.303 --> 04:07.181
still being inside seems kind of remote.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.184
Yeah, but you saw how important
it was to her. We have to try.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.353
You know, it would be remiss
of me if I didn't point out

04:12.377 --> 04:14.422
that you really should have
vetted this case more thoroughly

04:14.446 --> 04:15.957
when you spoke to Mrs. Yang.

04:15.981 --> 04:17.892
I was wondering how long
it was gonna take

04:17.916 --> 04:19.295
for you to bring that up.

04:19.319 --> 04:22.017
Well, it was a pretty big
screwup, Magnum, even for you.

04:24.422 --> 04:26.467
Oh, come on. You got to be kidding me.

04:26.491 --> 04:28.502
We were here for less than an hour.

04:28.526 --> 04:29.704
You better remember
to pay this one, Magnum,

04:29.728 --> 04:31.138
'cause while the Ferrari is Robin's,

04:31.162 --> 04:33.007
and the registration is under
his name, the vehicle

04:33.031 --> 04:35.042
- is your responsibility.
- My car, my responsibility.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.378
Yes, I know. You told me a hundred times.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.479
Well, you still haven't
managed to pay off

04:38.503 --> 04:39.747
the cost of the two new tires.

04:39.771 --> 04:41.015
I'm trying to get Five-O to cover that.

04:41.039 --> 04:42.216
D-Do you even see a sign?

04:42.240 --> 04:45.141
I don't see a sign anywhere
that says "no parking."

04:46.578 --> 04:47.888
Oh, come on. That's not fair.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.790
I-It's completely hidden

04:49.814 --> 04:51.325
behind the tree.

04:51.349 --> 04:53.249
I can definitely fight this.

04:54.285 --> 04:55.737
Hang on.

04:56.621 --> 04:58.399
If you didn't see the "no parking" sign,

04:58.423 --> 05:00.935
then maybe the thief didn't, either.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.692
Maybe they got a ticket, too.

05:05.730 --> 05:08.376
Look what I found on the Internet.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.877
Hmm?

05:09.901 --> 05:12.413
HU, baby.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.349
Now, listen, I thought we could
have our very own Wall of Fame.

05:15.373 --> 05:18.808
So do me a favor, slap your
signature down on that bad boy.

05:19.844 --> 05:21.422
Oh, man.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.290
Nobody's ever asked me
for my autograph, man.

05:23.314 --> 05:25.292
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

05:25.316 --> 05:26.927
Oh, listen, could you do me a favor?

05:26.951 --> 05:29.163
Could you sign it "Mr. Irrelevant"?

05:30.005 --> 05:32.633
I know you're sensitive
about the whole thing,

05:32.657 --> 05:34.902
so why don't we go with "Theodore Calvin,

05:34.926 --> 05:37.905
aka Mr. Irrelevant"? Go.

05:37.929 --> 05:39.440
Look, I ain't doing that.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.008
Oh, come on. Why not?

05:41.032 --> 05:42.843
Man, it's...
Being the last pick in the draft

05:42.867 --> 05:44.478
is not something I'm proud of.

05:44.502 --> 05:46.847
Yeah, but you were drafted, man,
that's awesome. Please?

05:46.871 --> 05:48.382
Come on. Please? Sign it.

05:48.406 --> 05:50.051
- Please?
- This is messed up, man.

05:50.075 --> 05:51.418
All right.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.055
Mr. Irrelevant here.

05:54.079 --> 05:56.991
Pretty big dea... Well, a minor big deal.

05:57.015 --> 05:58.292
All right, all right.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.927
Let me see what you got,
let me see what you got.

05:59.951 --> 06:01.818
"To my good friend...

06:03.054 --> 06:04.514
Orville."

06:04.989 --> 06:07.301
Well played, my friend. Very well played.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.303
Dre! Dre! Dre! Dre!

06:09.327 --> 06:11.205
What's going on over there?

06:11.229 --> 06:12.673
I guess Eddie got some kind of bonus

06:12.697 --> 06:15.142
down at the car dealership,
started buying rounds

06:15.166 --> 06:16.777
for everybody, and then some genius

06:16.801 --> 06:18.612
mistook him for Andre Reed.

06:18.636 --> 06:20.681
Hall of Famer Andre Reed?

06:20.705 --> 06:23.784
The very one. And I guess
he decided to go with it.

06:23.808 --> 06:26.053
- Whatever you need.
- Excuse me, Mr. Reed?

06:26.077 --> 06:29.890
Sorry to bother you, but I work
at the local pediatric hospital,

06:29.914 --> 06:33.227
and a lot of our kids
are huge football fans.

06:33.251 --> 06:35.262
Would you be able to visit
while you're on the island

06:35.286 --> 06:36.530
and sign some autographs?

06:36.554 --> 06:37.531
No, no, no.

06:37.555 --> 06:38.621
He wouldn't.

06:39.657 --> 06:40.801
I'd be happy to.

06:40.825 --> 06:41.802
Oh, my God.

06:41.826 --> 06:43.626
Mahalo. Here's my card.

06:44.996 --> 06:46.340
Um...

06:46.364 --> 06:47.508
Mr. Reed?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.110
Andre Reed?

06:49.134 --> 06:50.244
Can you come over here and have a word

06:50.268 --> 06:51.512
with us for just a second?

06:51.536 --> 06:53.314
I know you're busy,
but could we have a few moments

06:53.338 --> 06:54.982
of your precious time, sir?

06:55.006 --> 06:58.007
- Thank you.
- I will be right back.

06:59.844 --> 07:02.389
Hey, man, thanks for
not blowing my cover.

07:02.413 --> 07:04.558
Yeah, uh, Eddie, about that...

07:04.582 --> 07:07.394
Look, visiting that hospital,
it's a bad idea.

07:07.418 --> 07:09.230
I couldn't say no. Come on, brother.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.831
You remember what it was like.

07:10.855 --> 07:12.633
You played once. I mean,

07:12.657 --> 07:14.101
you didn't play on my level...

07:14.125 --> 07:16.403
Dude, you're not Andre Reed.

07:16.427 --> 07:17.805
Yeah, look, h-he's right.

07:17.829 --> 07:20.274
You can't go around pretending
to be somebody you're not.

07:20.298 --> 07:21.942
Especially to a bunch of sick kids, too.

07:21.966 --> 07:23.944
What's wrong with letting a few
kids thinking I'm Andre Reed

07:23.968 --> 07:25.101
if it's gonna make them happy?

07:26.513 --> 07:27.737
Another round.

07:28.773 --> 07:30.373
You're buying. No problem.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.420
This ain't gonna end well.

07:33.444 --> 07:34.771
Nope.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.597
You know, Hawaii actually has an app

07:43.621 --> 07:45.866
that allows you to pay
your parking fines.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.935
Yes, but you saw the branch.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.871
Right? It was completely
blocking the sign.

07:50.895 --> 07:52.206
I mean, I can fight this.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.941
If I fight it, I don't have to pay it.

07:53.965 --> 07:55.943
That would be an insane
waste of time and court costs.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.578
Just pay the bloody fine, Magnum.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.246
No. You know, on principle, for everybody

07:59.270 --> 08:00.814
that the system failed,

08:00.838 --> 08:02.783
I will fight this and I will not pay it.

08:02.807 --> 08:05.052
- Well, you're gonna lose.
- Have a little faith in me.

08:05.076 --> 08:06.854
I can't believe you're being this
cheap. I mean, you screwed up.

08:06.878 --> 08:08.244
Just own it.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.691
What is wrong with you today?

08:10.715 --> 08:14.028
Oh, can't I be exasperated
at your unwillingness

08:14.052 --> 08:17.064
to admit fault and admit
responsibility for once?

08:17.088 --> 08:19.600
No, it's not that. It's something else.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.902
Spill it. It'll make you feel better.

08:28.366 --> 08:29.977
My visa's expired.

08:30.001 --> 08:31.334
What are you talking about?

08:32.736 --> 08:34.215
When Robin first hired me,

08:34.239 --> 08:35.816
I thought the job might be temporary,

08:35.840 --> 08:38.986
so I applied for a temporary
visa and now it's up.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.087
If they won't renew it, then,

08:41.546 --> 08:43.991
I mean, I have to go back
to the U.K. to reapply,

08:44.015 --> 08:45.826
and that could take some time.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.194
Well, how long?

08:47.594 --> 08:49.185
Six months, maybe more.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.132
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

08:52.156 --> 08:54.401
Well, I have an immigration
lawyer, obviously,

08:54.425 --> 08:55.935
who's working on it.

08:56.427 --> 09:01.297
But, um, understandably,
it's kind of stressful, so...

09:02.967 --> 09:04.986
Sorry for taking it out on you.

09:07.392 --> 09:08.658
You still have to pay that ticket.

09:11.789 --> 09:13.087
- Could you grab that?
- Yeah.

09:13.111 --> 09:14.610
It's my HPD contact.

09:16.414 --> 09:20.394
Okay, so he says that there was
a car ticketed on Lynn's road

09:20.418 --> 09:22.062
at 10:43 last night.

09:22.086 --> 09:24.231
Lines up with the approximate
time of the robbery.

09:24.255 --> 09:26.533
He's forwarded
the registered owner's I.D.

09:26.557 --> 09:29.670
The vehicle is owned
by one Scottie Liu. No record.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.328
Lives in Mililani.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.199
Gordie.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.001
What are you two doing here?

10:01.025 --> 10:02.303
Was about to ask you the same question.

10:02.327 --> 10:03.993
We're following a lead
on the missing urn case.

10:05.830 --> 10:06.874
Who's the victim?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.542
Name's Scottie Liu.
Lived in the building.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.311
Neighbors heard a noise, found him dead.

10:10.335 --> 10:11.636
Looks like a homicide.

10:12.203 --> 10:14.348
- You said you were working a lead?
- Yeah.

10:14.372 --> 10:17.584
We think that Scottie Liu
may have been our thief.

10:17.608 --> 10:18.986
Well, either
it's a crazy coincidence or...

10:19.010 --> 10:20.710
These two crimes are related.

10:24.589 --> 10:26.133
So what can you tell us

10:26.157 --> 10:27.468
about Scottie Liu?

10:27.492 --> 10:29.770
Well, he's a hospice nurse
over at King's Medical.

10:29.794 --> 10:31.772
Had a girlfriend.
We're looking for her now.

10:31.796 --> 10:34.508
Okay, so gainful employment
and a steady relationship.

10:34.532 --> 10:36.176
Our "drug addict looking
for a quick flip" theory

10:36.200 --> 10:37.945
kind of doesn't seem to fit.

10:37.969 --> 10:40.114
Assuming Liu is our thief,

10:40.138 --> 10:42.785
why the hell would he break
into a house to steal an urn?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.451
I am just here to solve his murder.

10:44.475 --> 10:46.287
Whatever Liu wanted to do with your urn,

10:46.311 --> 10:47.788
that's for you to find out.

10:47.812 --> 10:49.390
You got five minutes.

10:49.414 --> 10:50.546
Don't disturb anything.

10:55.586 --> 10:57.631
Apply for an extension?

10:57.655 --> 10:59.166
Huh?

10:59.190 --> 11:00.567
For your visa.

11:00.591 --> 11:02.303
So you can buy yourself some

11:02.327 --> 11:04.138
- time to renew it?
- Oh!

11:04.162 --> 11:06.206
You can do that? Wow.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.808
Yes, of course I did... it was denied.

11:07.832 --> 11:09.977
Well, you know, you, uh,

11:10.001 --> 11:11.643
can always overstay your visa.

11:11.667 --> 11:14.012
You have 180 days.

11:14.036 --> 11:15.980
Yeah, and 171 days ago,

11:16.004 --> 11:17.782
that might have been an option.

11:17.806 --> 11:20.385
So you've already overstayed your visa.

11:20.409 --> 11:21.452
Yeah.

11:21.476 --> 11:23.321
And if I'm still here in ten days,

11:23.345 --> 11:25.790
I get barred from
reentering the United States

11:25.814 --> 11:27.158
for three years.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.683
Three years?

11:35.220 --> 11:37.635
You know, there is, there is...

11:37.659 --> 11:39.103
one thing you can do.

11:39.127 --> 11:40.505
What's that?

11:40.529 --> 11:41.684
Well...

11:42.231 --> 11:43.978
we can get married.

11:45.767 --> 11:47.979
- Come again?
- You know,

11:48.003 --> 11:49.214
we get married, you get your green card.

11:49.238 --> 11:50.481
Problem solved.

11:50.505 --> 11:52.417
Surely you're not serious.

11:52.441 --> 11:54.018
No, I'm totally serious.

11:54.042 --> 11:56.721
You know that marrying
for a green card is illegal.

11:56.745 --> 11:58.656
I don't see any other option, do you?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.625
Magnum, I'm not gonna commit a crime.

12:00.649 --> 12:02.961
Well, the offer's still on the table.

12:02.985 --> 12:05.263
Thank you for your generous...

12:05.287 --> 12:08.032
proposal, but I'm going to, uh...

12:08.056 --> 12:09.867
respectfully decline.

12:09.891 --> 12:11.069
Okay, well, what are you gonna do?

12:11.093 --> 12:12.337
I don't know.

12:12.361 --> 12:14.133
My lawyer will figure it out.

12:14.663 --> 12:15.873
Okay.

12:15.897 --> 12:17.575
No sign of any urn.

12:17.599 --> 12:20.878
I'm guessing Scottie must've
got rid of it somehow.

12:20.902 --> 12:22.213
Or he stashed it somewhere.

12:22.237 --> 12:23.815
Maybe we should go to the M.E.'s office,

12:23.839 --> 12:26.551
see what Noelani can
tell us about his murder.

12:26.575 --> 12:27.674
Mm-hmm.

12:42.124 --> 12:44.302
Let's hustle, she's probably
already filling in Katsumoto.

12:44.326 --> 12:46.493
Wait, Magnum, this is a loading zone.

12:50.832 --> 12:52.543
Oh, come on, you're not seriously

12:52.567 --> 12:54.779
going to use the ticket
from a previous infraction

12:54.803 --> 12:56.447
to avoid a second one on the same day?

12:56.471 --> 12:58.471
What are they gonna do, ticket me twice?

12:59.541 --> 13:00.618
Wha...

13:00.642 --> 13:02.140
Come on.

13:03.245 --> 13:04.856
We miss anything?

13:04.880 --> 13:08.026
No, I was just about to tell
Detective Katsumoto

13:08.050 --> 13:10.695
that Mr. Liu's C.O.D. was
blunt force trauma to the head.

13:10.719 --> 13:12.730
He was struck twice in the parietal bone,

13:12.754 --> 13:14.634
which caused intracranial hemorrhaging.

13:14.658 --> 13:16.567
He's also showing some
defensive bruising,

13:16.591 --> 13:18.369
which suggests there
was likely a struggle

13:18.393 --> 13:19.804
before the fatal blows.

13:19.828 --> 13:21.639
Any idea what the killer hit him with?

13:21.663 --> 13:23.675
That's where it gets tricky.

13:23.699 --> 13:26.444
This is Mr. Liu's skull.

13:26.468 --> 13:28.146
See the fracture right here?

13:28.170 --> 13:29.314
It has a unique shape.

13:29.338 --> 13:31.082
And it doesn't match
any common instruments

13:31.106 --> 13:32.317
used in a murder like this,

13:32.341 --> 13:34.519
such as a hammer or a bat.

13:34.543 --> 13:36.888
When CSU processed
the apartment, they didn't find

13:36.912 --> 13:38.589
any trace evidence
on anything that could've

13:38.613 --> 13:39.891
been used as the murder weapon.

13:39.915 --> 13:41.815
Hold on.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.519
Could this have done it?

13:52.327 --> 13:55.474
Yeah. Yeah, that could
definitely be a match.

13:55.498 --> 13:57.242
Thanks, Magnum.

13:57.266 --> 13:58.811
You might've just done my job for me.

13:58.835 --> 14:01.246
Okay, so if our missing urn was
indeed the murder weapon,

14:01.270 --> 14:04.083
then it confirms that
Scottie Liu was our thief.

14:04.107 --> 14:06.218
Since we didn't find
the urn at his apartment,

14:06.242 --> 14:07.786
it means that the killer
must've taken it with them.

14:07.810 --> 14:10.255
Which could mean he was
after the urn to begin with.

14:10.279 --> 14:11.623
Or the killer just didn't
want to leave it behind,

14:11.647 --> 14:12.958
because his prints were on it.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.694
Well, either way, we find
the killer, we find the urn.

14:15.718 --> 14:17.507
And our client's husband's ashes.

14:19.217 --> 14:20.599
Thank you, Dr. Cunha.

14:20.623 --> 14:21.700
No problem.

14:21.724 --> 14:23.168
I'm gonna check in with the unis.

14:23.192 --> 14:25.971
See if our canvass turned up any leads.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.106
Keep us in the loop?

14:27.130 --> 14:29.130
Sure, same as you do for me.

14:31.351 --> 14:34.279
If Mr. Liu's killer was after
the urn, it begs the question...

14:34.303 --> 14:35.714
What the hell is it about that urn

14:35.738 --> 14:37.416
that people are willing
to rob and kill for?

14:37.440 --> 14:38.653
Exactly.

14:39.175 --> 14:40.853
Maybe there's something else
inside the urn.

14:40.877 --> 14:42.221
You know, obviously, besides the ashes.

14:42.245 --> 14:43.789
Something valuable.

14:43.813 --> 14:45.124
- Such as?
- I don't know.

14:45.148 --> 14:46.425
But maybe we should talk to our client.

14:46.449 --> 14:47.969
See if there's something
she didn't tell us.

14:47.994 --> 14:49.461
Mm.

14:49.485 --> 14:51.266
You got to be kidding me.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.865
What did you think?

14:52.889 --> 14:55.067
That you could flagrantly
disobey traffic regulations

14:55.091 --> 14:57.358
twice in one day without repercussion?

15:00.129 --> 15:02.040
What happened to "lightning
never strikes twice"?

15:02.064 --> 15:03.776
Uh, I believe the saying is

15:03.800 --> 15:06.100
"lightning never strikes
the same place twice."

15:12.729 --> 15:14.553
You think there was something else

15:14.577 --> 15:16.121
inside Richard's urn?

15:16.145 --> 15:17.289
I'm sorry but that's...

15:17.313 --> 15:18.724
Insane, yes, we know.

15:18.748 --> 15:20.926
But people don't just go around
stealing urns, Mrs. Yang.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.428
And this one was stolen, uh...

15:22.452 --> 15:24.363
twice in less than 12 hours.

15:24.782 --> 15:26.565
Well, as far as I know, there was

15:26.589 --> 15:28.100
nothing else in there, except Richard.

15:28.124 --> 15:29.568
Right.

15:29.592 --> 15:32.526
Do you recognize this man?

15:35.665 --> 15:36.875
Wait.

15:37.378 --> 15:38.610
Yes.

15:38.634 --> 15:40.012
He's a nurse at King's Medical.

15:40.036 --> 15:42.648
Richard's older brother Buddy
was in hospice care there.

15:42.672 --> 15:44.616
I visited him before
he passed and this man

15:44.640 --> 15:46.852
was the nurse who was taking care of him.

15:46.876 --> 15:48.347
Hold on.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.502
This was Buddy.

15:52.181 --> 15:55.015
I was his only living relative.

16:00.990 --> 16:03.869
Okay, so before Buddy Yang dies,

16:03.893 --> 16:06.605
he tells Scottie Liu
something that compels him

16:06.629 --> 16:08.474
to go to Lynn's house to steal that urn.

16:08.498 --> 16:10.409
There had to be something valuable in it.

16:10.433 --> 16:12.411
That's the only explanation.

16:12.435 --> 16:13.745
If that's the case, then why not

16:13.769 --> 16:15.414
confide in our client, who's family?

16:15.438 --> 16:18.550
Why tell, essentially, a total stranger?

16:18.574 --> 16:20.252
Well, if Scottie was his hospice nurse,

16:20.276 --> 16:22.087
he wasn't a complete stranger.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.222
Yeah, but you see my point.

16:23.246 --> 16:24.456
Yeah, I understand.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.225
On the other hand, though, I mean,

16:26.249 --> 16:29.027
if Buddy was willing to tell
Scottie something he knew

16:29.051 --> 16:31.497
about the urn, then maybe
he also told someone else.

16:31.521 --> 16:35.334
Yeah, we got to see whoever
Buddy talked to before he died.

16:35.358 --> 16:36.602
Maybe head to the hospital to see

16:36.626 --> 16:37.736
if we can get a list of visitors.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.404
I mean, hospital's probably not likely

16:39.428 --> 16:41.907
to hand out confidential patient records.

16:41.931 --> 16:42.975
Why not? Buddy's dead.

16:42.999 --> 16:44.676
I don't think that matters, Magnum.

16:45.113 --> 16:47.112
Maybe we should ask Gordon for help.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.501
If we ask Gordon, we're gonna
have to get a-a search warrant.

16:49.525 --> 16:50.747
It's gonna eat up valuable time.

16:50.771 --> 16:53.908
I say we just go down there
and take care of it ourselves.

17:01.651 --> 17:03.428
The security office
will have the visitor logs.

17:03.452 --> 17:04.563
Do you have a plan?

17:04.587 --> 17:05.897
Not really.

17:05.922 --> 17:08.689
I'm not really comfortable
winging it, Magnum.

17:14.752 --> 17:16.195
I have an idea.

17:24.140 --> 17:27.152
I'd be lying if I said I didn't
have any doubts about this plan.

17:27.175 --> 17:29.120
What are you talking about?
The plan is great.

17:29.144 --> 17:31.022
I just don't think anyone's
gonna buy you as a physician.

17:31.046 --> 17:32.456
Do I have to remind you about the time

17:32.480 --> 17:34.659
when I played Dr. Thomás Caballé,

17:34.683 --> 17:37.528
world-renowned brain surgeon,
and executed it flawlessly?

17:37.552 --> 17:39.185
I thought he was a vascular surgeon.

17:40.221 --> 17:41.365
You may be right, actually.

17:41.389 --> 17:42.567
Don't worry about it.

17:42.591 --> 17:43.768
The-the plan's gonna work, all right?

17:43.792 --> 17:44.802
Just sit tight.

17:44.826 --> 17:46.292
I'll be back.

18:06.334 --> 18:07.412
Hey.

18:07.437 --> 18:08.514
Dr. Caballé.

18:08.541 --> 18:09.551
Uh, would you mind giving us a hand...

18:09.575 --> 18:11.253
- Kanoa?
- What's wrong?

18:11.277 --> 18:12.654
There's a patient in 417.

18:12.678 --> 18:14.089
He's getting kind of worked up.

18:14.113 --> 18:15.657
We think he may become violent.

18:15.681 --> 18:16.658
Could you help us out?

18:16.682 --> 18:18.093
Of course.

18:18.117 --> 18:19.983
Appreciate it.

18:21.821 --> 18:22.898
Oh, uh...

18:22.922 --> 18:24.399
You know what?

18:24.423 --> 18:26.334
I got to head to the OR.
Would you mind going

18:26.358 --> 18:27.803
down there and I'll just see you
there in a bit?

18:27.827 --> 18:29.593
- You got it.
- Perfect.

18:52.384 --> 18:53.951
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on...

19:08.021 --> 19:09.845
Wait, Doctor? Doctor?

19:09.869 --> 19:11.368
Can I get some help?

19:18.611 --> 19:20.689
What seems to be the problem, sir?

19:20.713 --> 19:22.624
My bed pan's full.

19:22.648 --> 19:24.593
You know what?

19:24.617 --> 19:26.561
I'll-I'll get an orderly
right away, just...

19:26.585 --> 19:29.531
Yeah, yeah, but wait, I've
been waiting a while now.

19:29.555 --> 19:30.966
I-I know you're a doctor, but...

19:32.658 --> 19:34.458
...can't you help me out here?

19:48.607 --> 19:49.785
Don't ask.

19:49.809 --> 19:50.852
Did you get it?

19:50.876 --> 19:51.987
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

19:52.011 --> 19:53.155
But next time...

19:53.179 --> 19:54.656
you're going undercover.

19:56.916 --> 19:58.894
Okay, so other than our client,

19:58.918 --> 20:01.263
the only visitor
that Buddy Yang had was a

20:01.287 --> 20:03.298
Father Paul S. Brendan.

20:03.322 --> 20:05.433
- A priest?
- Yeah.

20:05.457 --> 20:09.004
He's the parish priest
at St. Bernadette church.

20:09.028 --> 20:10.772
According to the visitor logs,

20:10.796 --> 20:12.874
our victim Scottie Liu was
the one who signed him in.

20:12.898 --> 20:14.242
I can only assume he was there

20:14.266 --> 20:15.710
to administer Buddy's last rites.

20:15.734 --> 20:18.113
Well, still, if he talked
to Buddy before he died,

20:18.137 --> 20:19.514
he's someone we should talk to.

20:19.538 --> 20:20.904
Yeah.

20:25.897 --> 20:27.297
Oh, my God.

20:28.377 --> 20:29.558
What's going on?

20:29.582 --> 20:31.582
You got to check this out.

20:33.052 --> 20:35.463
"Top Ten Shaved Ice on Oahu"?

20:35.487 --> 20:36.987
Scroll further down.

20:38.424 --> 20:39.568
Oh, boy.

20:39.592 --> 20:40.791
Yep.

20:41.794 --> 20:44.472
"Ex-NFL Star Visits Sick Kids."

20:44.496 --> 20:46.041
I can't believe he actually
went through with it.

20:46.065 --> 20:47.209
What's wrong with this guy?

20:47.233 --> 20:48.410
I mean, lying to a bunch of kids.

20:48.434 --> 20:50.045
- Who does that?
- I mean...

20:50.069 --> 20:52.214
I guess Eddie's a car salesman;

20:52.238 --> 20:53.815
lying probably comes naturally to him.

20:53.839 --> 20:55.283
It's probably just second nature.

20:55.307 --> 20:56.751
He name-checked La Mariana.

20:56.775 --> 20:59.087
Yeah, I know, he said it was
his favorite place to drink.

20:59.111 --> 21:00.655
And, normally, I'd be all
for the free publicity,

21:00.679 --> 21:02.257
but not if we're gonna get it this way.

21:02.281 --> 21:04.793
Well, that does it.
You got to ban the guy.

21:04.817 --> 21:06.461
From the bar?

21:06.485 --> 21:08.263
Hell yeah. What he did wasn't cool.

21:08.287 --> 21:10.732
Uh, yeah, look, I-I'm not saying
what Eddie did was right,

21:10.756 --> 21:12.300
but telling the guy he can't drink here?

21:12.324 --> 21:14.302
That seems a bit extreme,
don't you think?

21:14.326 --> 21:15.904
Look, he was scamming customers.

21:15.928 --> 21:17.272
Yeah, but nobody got hurt.

21:17.296 --> 21:18.506
But it ain't about that.

21:18.530 --> 21:20.175
Look, I don't know
if you looked around, but...

21:20.199 --> 21:21.509
I-I just don't think we can afford

21:21.533 --> 21:23.245
to turn people away right now.

21:23.269 --> 21:24.412
Yeah, but if you let this slide,

21:24.436 --> 21:25.881
it's like you're saying it's all right.

21:25.905 --> 21:27.349
Come on.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.351
What are we, the integrity police?

21:29.375 --> 21:30.919
Look, it's none of our business.

21:30.943 --> 21:33.088
Right? And besides,
we've all made stupid mistakes.

21:33.112 --> 21:34.256
Look, man,

21:34.280 --> 21:35.624
you do what you want to do.

21:35.648 --> 21:38.348
I mean, this is your place.
But you set the tone here.

21:40.486 --> 21:42.452
Think about it.

21:52.503 --> 21:53.671
What?

21:54.733 --> 21:56.845
Well, I... You won't marry me,

21:56.869 --> 22:00.181
but we find ourselves inside
a church, waiting for a priest.

22:00.205 --> 22:03.752
I actually can't believe you'd
even float that absurd idea.

22:04.265 --> 22:06.955
Way I see it, it's the only
way out of that visa issue.

22:06.979 --> 22:09.024
Magnum, it would be an illegal sham.

22:09.048 --> 22:11.393
Would it, though?
I mean, w-we're kind of like

22:11.417 --> 22:13.528
a-a married couple ten years in.

22:13.552 --> 22:17.032
We sleep under the same roof,
we get on each other's nerves.

22:17.056 --> 22:19.467
We don't sleep together.

22:19.491 --> 22:21.970
That's kind of some people's
definition of a marriage.

22:21.994 --> 22:23.805
Magnum, we're not
getting married, all right?

22:23.829 --> 22:26.875
Not now, not ever.
My lawyer will fix this.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.377
Hello.

22:29.401 --> 22:31.746
I'm Father Brendan.
You asked to speak with me?

22:31.770 --> 22:32.914
Hi. Yes.

22:32.938 --> 22:34.683
Uh, Thomas Magnum and Juliet Higgins.

22:34.707 --> 22:36.830
We're private investigators.
We just had a question

22:36.854 --> 22:39.721
about somebody you visited
in hospice last week.

22:40.172 --> 22:41.338
Buddy Yang.

22:41.947 --> 22:43.091
What is this about?

22:43.115 --> 22:44.259
This morning,

22:44.283 --> 22:47.062
Mr. Yang's nurse Scottie Liu
was found murdered.

22:47.766 --> 22:48.930
We think it had something

22:48.954 --> 22:50.432
to do with an urn he stole

22:50.456 --> 22:52.356
that contained the ashes
of Buddy's brother.

22:53.798 --> 22:55.297
I see.

22:57.196 --> 22:58.840
We believe that the killer might have

22:58.864 --> 23:00.342
been after the urn as well.

23:00.366 --> 23:02.877
And we were wondering if Buddy
might have told you something

23:02.901 --> 23:04.379
that might explain why?

23:04.403 --> 23:08.049
I'm afraid whatever Mr. Yang
said is between himself and God.

23:08.495 --> 23:10.218
Okay, so he did tell you something.

23:10.242 --> 23:13.555
I'm sorry, but the Sacrament
of Penance is a sacred one.

23:13.579 --> 23:15.924
I'm forbidden from disclosing
anything that was said to me.

23:15.948 --> 23:18.971
Father Brendan, if you
have information that could help us

23:18.995 --> 23:21.785
catch Mr. Liu's killer, you
really need to be forthcoming.

23:23.155 --> 23:25.433
I know this might be
difficult to understand,

23:25.457 --> 23:26.762
but I took an oath.

23:26.786 --> 23:28.659
I'm bound by Church law and by God.

23:28.683 --> 23:30.228
I wish I could help.

23:30.252 --> 23:31.512
I truly do.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.108
But I'm afraid there's
nothing I can tell you.

23:33.729 --> 23:35.132
I'm sorry.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.981
You see the way he reacted
when I first mentioned the urn?

23:40.005 --> 23:41.616
Yeah, he barely reacted at all.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.355
Yeah, exactly. He wasn't surprised.

23:43.379 --> 23:45.909
It's like he knows what this is about.

23:48.444 --> 23:50.601
I can't compel a priest to
break the Seal of Confession.

23:50.626 --> 23:52.103
So, there's nothing you can do?

23:52.127 --> 23:54.750
Even if there were,
some things are sacred.

23:55.462 --> 23:56.587
Okay, well, at least tell us

23:56.612 --> 23:58.590
you have something on
Scottie Liu's murder.

23:58.614 --> 23:59.758
Wish I could.

23:59.782 --> 24:01.893
CSU processed the scene.
There were no prints.

24:01.917 --> 24:03.895
And no one in the building
saw anything suspicious.

24:03.919 --> 24:05.764
What about Scottie's girlfriend?
You talk to her?

24:05.788 --> 24:07.732
We did. Last week,

24:07.756 --> 24:09.568
he said he was about
to come into a lot of money.

24:09.592 --> 24:11.803
Said he overheard something
that was gonna change his life,

24:11.827 --> 24:13.371
didn't give her any details.

24:13.395 --> 24:15.941
Never mentioned Buddy Yang or an urn.

24:15.965 --> 24:17.576
That doesn't really give us
anything new to go on.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.578
No. But, I mean, at least it confirms

24:19.602 --> 24:21.246
our suspicion that there
was something of value

24:21.270 --> 24:22.581
inside that urn.

24:22.605 --> 24:24.583
Most likely, what Scottie overheard

24:24.607 --> 24:26.251
was Buddy's confession to Father Brendan.

24:26.275 --> 24:28.253
What can you tell me about Buddy?
What do you guys know about him?

24:28.277 --> 24:29.654
So, according to our client,

24:29.678 --> 24:32.057
he went into corporate security
after he left the Army.

24:32.081 --> 24:33.825
He also did some private security work

24:33.849 --> 24:36.494
for a handful of wealthy
families here on the island.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.463
If he did security work
for any prominent families,

24:38.487 --> 24:40.365
chances are he had some
interaction with the department.

24:40.389 --> 24:42.300
I'll ask some of the older guys
if they knew him.

24:42.324 --> 24:44.803
In the meantime, I'm gonna take
another crack at Father Brendan,

24:44.827 --> 24:46.838
see if I can get him
to reveal what he knows.

24:46.862 --> 24:48.873
I doubt you'll get anywhere.

24:48.897 --> 24:50.342
I mean, he's a man of God, right?

24:50.366 --> 24:52.644
He can't just ignore the fact
that a person's been murdered.

24:52.668 --> 24:54.179
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

24:54.601 --> 24:56.781
Well, I still have to try.

24:56.805 --> 24:58.316
You think you're gonna wear him down

24:58.340 --> 25:00.318
just like you do everyone else?

25:00.342 --> 25:01.987
Gordon's right. It's a fool's errand.

25:02.011 --> 25:03.744
Maybe, but it's worth a shot.

25:11.353 --> 25:12.497
Let me tell y'all.

25:12.521 --> 25:14.766
My favorite game of all time
is The Comeback,

25:14.790 --> 25:16.468
playing in the AFC wild card.

25:16.492 --> 25:18.937
Down 32 points against Houston.

25:18.961 --> 25:21.273
I had three touchdowns
in the second half.

25:21.297 --> 25:22.808
- Epic.
- Yeah, man,

25:22.833 --> 25:24.342
it was a great game. Great game.

25:24.798 --> 25:26.278
How long is he gonna keep this up?

25:26.302 --> 25:27.779
Yeah, I-I...

25:27.803 --> 25:29.345
You know what?

25:30.339 --> 25:32.539
I got a feeling not for long.

25:34.558 --> 25:36.254
- You ratted him out?
- No, man, I'm not a snitch.

25:36.278 --> 25:37.656
- This thing went viral.
- Sir?

25:37.680 --> 25:39.824
- I don't think I would...
- I need you to come with us.

25:39.848 --> 25:40.825
You're under arrest.

25:40.849 --> 25:41.993
What? Why?

25:42.017 --> 25:44.462
You can't go around impersonating
a famous football player.

25:44.486 --> 25:45.530
What's he talking about?

25:45.554 --> 25:46.498
I can explain.

25:46.522 --> 25:47.521
Come on. Stand up.

25:52.695 --> 25:54.072
Guys, come on.

25:54.096 --> 25:55.696
Dude, we warned you.

26:03.772 --> 26:06.751
Higgins and Katsumoto are probably right.

26:06.775 --> 26:08.753
Maybe this is a waste of time.

26:08.777 --> 26:11.456
Father Brendan took a vow he can't break.

26:11.480 --> 26:15.015
But Higgins and I also made
a promise, to our client.

26:28.831 --> 26:30.447
Father Brendan?

26:33.283 --> 26:34.901
Father?

26:40.275 --> 26:43.521
Mr. Magnum? What are you doing here?

26:43.545 --> 26:45.457
Are you alone?

26:45.481 --> 26:46.991
Yes. Is everything okay?

26:51.253 --> 26:52.753
Stay here.

27:10.439 --> 27:11.950
Who the hell are you?

27:13.842 --> 27:15.754
Easy.

27:15.778 --> 27:18.056
Easy.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.080
I asked you a question.

28:33.889 --> 28:36.114
Stop! I don't want to shoot you!

28:36.925 --> 28:38.525
You have nowhere to go.

28:39.728 --> 28:41.005
Listen.

28:41.029 --> 28:42.128
Let's just talk.

28:46.535 --> 28:48.046
Come on, man. I'm not a cop.

28:48.070 --> 28:49.981
I'm just looking for an urn.

28:50.005 --> 28:50.915
No!

29:11.576 --> 29:12.656
That was fast.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.285
Yeah, I was on my way back to
Robin's Nest when you called.

29:15.309 --> 29:16.619
So, care to fill me in?

29:16.643 --> 29:20.089
Guy's name was Gregory Fallon,
a local, had an arrest record.

29:20.113 --> 29:21.958
Assault and possession of a weapon.

29:21.982 --> 29:23.693
Do we yet know how he's
connected to our case?

29:23.717 --> 29:24.994
No.

29:25.664 --> 29:27.263
We ran Fallon's car.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.232
Turns out it was picked up
by a plate reader two blocks

29:29.256 --> 29:30.800
from Scottie Liu's apartment
around Liu's time of death.

29:30.824 --> 29:33.102
So Fallon may have killed Liu.

29:33.126 --> 29:34.270
Well, if that's the case,

29:34.294 --> 29:36.139
then it's likely that Fallon had the urn.

29:36.163 --> 29:37.273
I think he did.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.209
We used Fallon's fingerprint
to unlock his phone.

29:39.233 --> 29:40.944
Found two texts to another number.

29:40.968 --> 29:42.312
First one said "Got it,"

29:42.336 --> 29:44.314
and was sent shortly after
Scottie Liu's time of death.

29:44.338 --> 29:47.283
Okay, so by "it," we can assume
he was referring to the urn.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.319
If he was sending updates, he
was working with somebody else.

29:49.343 --> 29:51.554
What about the second text?

29:51.578 --> 29:54.490
Just a number: four-three-six-two.

29:54.514 --> 29:56.059
Nothing else,
but we're tracing the number

29:56.083 --> 29:57.293
those texts were sent to.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.528
Meantime, I've sent officers

29:58.552 --> 30:00.063
to Fallon's house to search for the urn.

30:00.087 --> 30:02.999
Okay, well, if we're right
about Fallon having the urn,

30:03.023 --> 30:05.235
then it begs one huge question.

30:05.259 --> 30:07.570
If there was something valuable
inside that urn,

30:07.594 --> 30:09.305
and Fallon already had it,

30:09.329 --> 30:12.063
then why would he come here
to confront Father Brendan?

30:15.714 --> 30:17.747
Father, he had a handgun and gloves,

30:17.771 --> 30:19.015
and was lying in wait.

30:19.039 --> 30:21.184
It's obvious that man
came here to do you harm.

30:21.208 --> 30:24.097
And this man risked his life to save you.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.100
And I am in your debt.

30:27.981 --> 30:29.792
But my answer is still the same.

30:29.816 --> 30:31.427
Two people are dead now, Father.

30:31.451 --> 30:33.062
And we think Fallon wasn't
the only person involved.

30:33.086 --> 30:34.230
We think there's someone else,

30:34.254 --> 30:35.598
which means you could still be in danger.

30:35.622 --> 30:37.767
I understand,
but I have to follow my faith,

30:37.791 --> 30:38.935
no matter the risk.

30:39.529 --> 30:40.904
It's okay.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.950
I respect your decision. I think, uh...

30:45.661 --> 30:47.412
I think we all do.

30:47.968 --> 30:49.045
Thank you, Father.

30:49.069 --> 30:50.313
Thank you.

30:50.957 --> 30:53.149
I know you'll do all you can
to solve this crime.

30:53.173 --> 30:55.451
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there's something I have to do.

30:55.475 --> 30:58.021
The man who came to hurt me...
he may have been a killer,

30:58.045 --> 31:00.456
but someone should pray for his soul.

31:05.552 --> 31:06.718
Katsumoto.

31:08.588 --> 31:09.866
All right.

31:09.890 --> 31:11.834
Got a hit on the number Fallon texted.

31:11.858 --> 31:13.536
Belongs to a man named James Hutton.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.238
He grew up on the island,
but moved to the mainland

31:15.262 --> 31:16.906
40 years ago.

31:16.930 --> 31:18.207
Here we are.

31:18.231 --> 31:19.842
James Nicolas Hutton.

31:19.866 --> 31:21.711
He was the sole heir to his family's

31:21.735 --> 31:23.413
vast real estate holdings on the island.

31:23.437 --> 31:25.148
Sold it off piecemeal in the late '80s.

31:25.172 --> 31:27.583
Looks like he's only grown
his family's fortune since then.

31:27.607 --> 31:30.353
Wealthy family... could have
a connection to Buddy.

31:30.377 --> 31:31.454
They might have been one of the families

31:31.478 --> 31:32.522
that Buddy did security work for.

31:32.546 --> 31:34.479
- May I?
- Yeah, of course.

31:36.917 --> 31:38.227
Hutton's in the system.

31:38.251 --> 31:39.929
Couple DUIs in the '70s.

31:39.953 --> 31:41.564
And that's not all.

31:41.588 --> 31:44.000
Seems he was a suspect
in a fatal hit-and-run.

31:44.024 --> 31:45.435
In July of '79, a woman on a bike

31:45.459 --> 31:47.603
was struck and killed on Roundtop Drive.

31:47.627 --> 31:48.738
But when the cops got there,

31:48.762 --> 31:50.573
the driver was nowhere to be found.

31:50.597 --> 31:51.774
The car was registered to Hutton.

31:51.798 --> 31:53.476
Okay, so Hutton struck a pedestrian

31:53.500 --> 31:55.745
and then escaped on foot.
Sounds like an honorable chap.

31:55.769 --> 31:58.181
Well, it says here he told HPD
his car had been stolen

31:58.205 --> 31:59.449
earlier that night.

31:59.473 --> 32:02.352
Still, the detectives
who were working the case

32:02.376 --> 32:04.053
suspected he was the one
behind the wheel.

32:04.077 --> 32:05.688
And that he was heavily
under the influence.

32:05.712 --> 32:07.924
- Why wasn't he ever arrested?
- He had an alibi.

32:07.948 --> 32:09.692
Said he was on
the other side of the island

32:09.716 --> 32:11.594
at the time of the accident.
Two people verified it.

32:11.618 --> 32:14.197
Come on, a rich kid like that
could have bought that alibi.

32:14.624 --> 32:16.099
Okay, we still don't know
how Hutton's connected

32:16.123 --> 32:17.501
to our missing urn.

32:20.327 --> 32:22.521
My guys just searched
Fallon's house. No urn.

32:22.545 --> 32:24.040
Well, we need to retrace Fallon's steps.

32:24.064 --> 32:25.675
See where he went after Liu's apartment

32:25.699 --> 32:27.110
but before the church.

32:27.134 --> 32:29.512
He had to have dropped the
urn off somewhere in between.

32:29.536 --> 32:31.647
There might be something
in his financials. Hang on.

32:32.517 --> 32:33.816
Okay, so,

32:33.840 --> 32:35.385
a few recurring charges.

32:35.409 --> 32:36.986
Only one charge from today.

32:37.010 --> 32:38.755
Okay. This is weird.

32:38.779 --> 32:40.757
It's a one-night stay
at the Okalani Hotel.

32:40.781 --> 32:42.258
I mean, he's a local, right?

32:42.282 --> 32:44.394
Yeah. So why rent a hotel room?

32:44.418 --> 32:46.362
Hold on. What was the second text

32:46.386 --> 32:48.398
that Fallon sent to Hutton...

32:48.422 --> 32:49.799
the number?

32:49.823 --> 32:50.924
4-3-6-2.

32:50.948 --> 32:52.702
I think I know what that is.

32:53.497 --> 32:55.772
- We got to get to the hotel.
- Why?

32:55.796 --> 32:57.273
Because I think
that's where the urn's at.

32:57.297 --> 32:59.898
4-3-6-2.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.576
There's something here
on top of the ashes.

33:13.642 --> 33:15.825
Looks like undeveloped film.

33:15.849 --> 33:17.627
This format hasn't been used for years.

33:17.651 --> 33:19.495
Seems there must be something on there

33:19.519 --> 33:21.030
that was worth killing over.

33:21.054 --> 33:23.254
We have to get that developed right away.

33:27.586 --> 33:30.353
Developing old cartridge film is tricky.

33:32.899 --> 33:35.897
It involves a cocktail
of chemicals, photo paper

33:35.921 --> 33:37.613
and a little luck.

33:37.637 --> 33:41.284
You do it wrong, and it's lost to time.

33:41.308 --> 33:43.219
How do you know how to do this?

33:43.243 --> 33:45.688
Well, when I was kid,
my neighbor was a P.I.

33:45.712 --> 33:47.857
and he asked me to run
errands for him one summer.

33:47.881 --> 33:50.660
Actually had a dark room,
taught me how to develop film.

33:50.684 --> 33:52.195
So I presume this chap is the one

33:52.219 --> 33:53.896
who inspired you
to pursue this profession?

33:53.920 --> 33:55.731
Here I thought
you became a P.I. to annoy me.

34:34.152 --> 34:35.485
Actually worked.

34:38.931 --> 34:40.775
- This is interesting.
- What's that?

34:40.800 --> 34:42.065
Look for yourself.

34:44.971 --> 34:46.549
I'm thinking that's the
aftermath of that hit-and-run

34:46.572 --> 34:49.284
that HPD thought
Hutton was involved with.

34:49.309 --> 34:50.920
You can see Hutton in some of these.

34:52.114 --> 34:53.623
These photos contradict everything

34:53.647 --> 34:54.790
he told detectives back in '79.

34:54.813 --> 34:56.125
- May I?
- Yeah.

34:56.149 --> 34:57.793
We need to find out
who shot this roll of film

34:57.817 --> 34:59.228
and why these photos never came to light.

34:59.252 --> 35:00.897
Assuming he was working
for the Hutton family,

35:00.921 --> 35:02.899
Buddy probably had
something to do with it.

35:02.923 --> 35:05.568
Either he paid off the
photographer or worse.

35:05.592 --> 35:07.403
But either way,
he got his hands on that film.

35:07.427 --> 35:08.738
And then he told his employer

35:08.762 --> 35:10.106
that he destroyed it, but instead

35:10.130 --> 35:13.109
he hung on to it for insurance
or for future leverage.

35:13.133 --> 35:14.477
But whatever the motives were,

35:14.501 --> 35:16.779
I mean, putting it inside
that urn was a stroke of genius.

35:16.803 --> 35:18.181
I mean, no one's gonna look for it there

35:18.205 --> 35:19.649
or let anything happen to it.

35:19.673 --> 35:21.584
It's essentially like putting it
in a safe deposit box.

35:21.608 --> 35:25.821
Except the guilt of the cover-up
weighs on him.

35:25.845 --> 35:27.540
And he confesses to Father Brendan

35:27.564 --> 35:30.052
about the evidence,
the urn, the whole thing.

35:30.076 --> 35:33.658
Only, Scottie Liu overhears the admission

35:33.682 --> 35:35.464
and decides to cash in.

35:35.488 --> 35:36.799
Hutton's a wealthy guy.

35:36.823 --> 35:38.901
And there's no statute
of limitations on manslaughter.

35:38.925 --> 35:42.672
It's the perfect circumstances
for a blackmail play.

35:42.696 --> 35:45.474
So Hutton sends Fallon to
kill Liu and recover the film.

35:45.498 --> 35:46.742
And then Fallon goes after Father Brendan

35:46.766 --> 35:48.010
to close the loop.

35:48.034 --> 35:50.146
I mean... yes,

35:50.170 --> 35:52.748
but this is all conjecture at this point.

35:52.772 --> 35:55.184
Well, that's true, but there is
one way to test this theory.

35:55.208 --> 35:57.353
Fallon left the film for Hutton.

35:57.377 --> 36:00.178
There's no way he's not gonna
go back to pick it up.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.248
Ten minutes.

36:06.286 --> 36:08.231
A guest left a key here for me.

36:08.255 --> 36:09.754
The name's James Hutton.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.352
HPD, Mr. Hutton. Let me see your hands.

36:29.376 --> 36:30.653
Hey, what is this?

36:30.677 --> 36:32.288
We know you hired Gregory Fallon

36:32.312 --> 36:33.856
to recover evidence from a hit-and-run

36:33.880 --> 36:35.024
you committed 41 years ago.

36:35.048 --> 36:36.626
And we know you just flew in from L.A.

36:36.650 --> 36:38.094
by private jet to come pick it up.

36:39.139 --> 36:40.496
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say

36:40.520 --> 36:42.726
can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

36:44.477 --> 36:46.767
They let him out, huh?

36:46.791 --> 36:48.971
Oh, after he paid a pretty hefty fine,

36:48.995 --> 36:52.041
pretty much ate up that big bonus of his.

36:52.065 --> 36:53.876
Mm. Ay-ay-ay.

36:53.900 --> 36:55.144
Yeah, tell me about it.

36:55.168 --> 36:56.445
Been sitting there

36:56.469 --> 36:59.015
nursing that same cheap beer for hours.

36:59.039 --> 37:01.851
Don't think he'll be buying
many rounds anytime soon.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.875
Hmm. Mm, mm, mm.

37:08.548 --> 37:10.426
- Yo.
- What?

37:10.450 --> 37:11.427
Oh.

37:11.451 --> 37:12.928
Hey, what's up, man? I'm Andre Reed.

37:12.952 --> 37:14.096
Yeah, we know that.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.398
Hey, I'm Rick. This is TC.

37:15.422 --> 37:16.399
Thanks for coming down.

37:16.423 --> 37:17.500
Wait. What?

37:17.524 --> 37:19.168
I called Robin, Robin knew a guy,

37:19.192 --> 37:21.270
of course, who knew Andre, they
smoothed the whole thing over.

37:21.294 --> 37:23.406
Yeah, he convinced me
not to press any charges.

37:23.430 --> 37:25.174
Then he sent a private
jet to come pick me up

37:25.198 --> 37:26.442
so I could come visit with the kids.

37:26.466 --> 37:28.344
Robin does it again.

37:28.368 --> 37:30.579
So this is where it all started, huh?

37:30.603 --> 37:32.548
Yeah. Look, man, we're really sorry.

37:32.572 --> 37:33.849
Our boy Eddie

37:33.873 --> 37:37.342
over there... he got
carried away trying to be you.

37:40.313 --> 37:41.624
That guy looks nothing like me.

37:41.648 --> 37:43.125
- That's what we said.
- That's what we said.

37:43.149 --> 37:45.294
Anyway, I got to get
over to the hospital,

37:45.318 --> 37:46.562
make it up to these kids.

37:46.586 --> 37:47.596
Hey, I'll give you a ride.

37:47.620 --> 37:48.898
Let's do it.

37:48.922 --> 37:50.232
Hey, can we talk about the comeback?

37:50.256 --> 37:52.390
As long as we don't talk
about the four Super Bowls.

37:56.296 --> 37:57.540
According to HPD,

37:57.564 --> 37:59.875
Buddy was known
as a fixer back in the day,

37:59.899 --> 38:02.645
and did some very questionable
things for his clients,

38:02.669 --> 38:06.148
including threats, bribes, extortion, but

38:07.227 --> 38:09.385
never anything quite like this.

38:09.771 --> 38:12.988
I swear I had no idea Buddy was
involved in anything like that.

38:13.012 --> 38:14.623
My husband kept it from me.

38:14.647 --> 38:16.392
Well, it's likely that he didn't know.

38:16.820 --> 38:18.361
I mean, Buddy wouldn't be the first man

38:18.385 --> 38:20.463
to keep secrets from his family.

38:21.366 --> 38:23.499
My dear Richard is back with me now,

38:23.523 --> 38:26.402
and I have the both of you
to thank for that.

38:26.426 --> 38:27.670
Thank you

38:27.694 --> 38:29.071
for finding him.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.108
Of course.

38:52.152 --> 38:55.865
Well, I think it's been
a pretty successful day.

38:55.889 --> 38:57.500
We returned the urn,

38:57.524 --> 39:00.603
and after 41 years, brought
a criminal to justice.

39:00.627 --> 39:04.306
Yeah, your two parking tickets
not withstanding, I say I agree.

39:09.027 --> 39:10.804
Hello?

39:10.829 --> 39:12.362
Yes.

39:13.543 --> 39:15.044
I understand.

39:16.212 --> 39:18.643
Yeah. Thank you.

39:20.425 --> 39:21.646
Everything okay?

39:23.283 --> 39:25.027
It's my immigration lawyer.

39:25.471 --> 39:28.831
He filed an emergency appeal,
but it was denied.

39:29.309 --> 39:33.068
So it looks like I'm gonna have to
go back to the UK to renew my visa.

39:33.092 --> 39:35.070
He said he was gonna
take care of everything.

39:35.094 --> 39:37.106
Well, obviously, he couldn't.

39:37.130 --> 39:38.874
Okay, well, worst-case scenario,

39:38.898 --> 39:41.143
you got to go back to the
UK for six months, right?

39:41.167 --> 39:42.978
Yeah, that's if I'm really lucky.

39:43.002 --> 39:45.147
He said that there's a backlog
of visa applicants

39:45.171 --> 39:46.982
so it could take much longer, and

39:47.006 --> 39:49.084
'cause I overstayed so long,

39:49.108 --> 39:51.542
there is a chance
that they'll deny me entirely.

39:53.499 --> 39:55.858
I guess you really do
only have one option left.

39:55.882 --> 39:57.560
Magnum, stop it. It's not funny anymore.

39:57.584 --> 39:58.894
I'm not being funny.
I'm telling you the truth.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.596
I think you should seriously consider.

40:00.620 --> 40:02.665
Magnum, it would be a total fraud.

40:02.689 --> 40:05.367
I mean, you're
the hopeless romantic among us.

40:05.391 --> 40:08.904
Surely, this wedding wouldn't
be an ideal situation for you.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.906
It's crazy that you even suggest it.

40:10.930 --> 40:12.608
Okay, it's not ideal,
but we'll figure it out.

40:12.632 --> 40:15.211
We-we can get an annulment later. It's...

40:15.235 --> 40:18.113
It's fine. I don't think
that's the problem, though.

40:18.137 --> 40:21.584
I think it's that you don't know
how to accept help.

40:21.608 --> 40:23.085
What are you talking about?

40:23.655 --> 40:25.054
You think asking for help

40:25.078 --> 40:27.623
is some kind of sign of weakness.

40:27.647 --> 40:30.392
But it's not. It's the complete
opposite of that.

40:30.416 --> 40:32.294
Y...

40:33.498 --> 40:34.530
Look, you've had my back

40:34.554 --> 40:36.787
since before we were even partners.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.268
Let me help you.

40:40.505 --> 40:41.714
This is insane.

40:43.466 --> 40:45.774
I don't see any other option.

40:46.552 --> 40:48.277
I mean, you do want to stay
in Hawaii, don't you?

40:49.055 --> 40:50.012
Yes.

40:50.036 --> 40:53.101
Well,
okay then. You have no other choice.

40:53.640 --> 40:56.437
So, that being the case...

40:57.647 --> 40:59.277
will you fake marry me?

41:11.953 --> 41:13.369
Okay.

41:13.788 --> 41:15.137
Fine. I will.

41:16.598 --> 41:17.673
Really?

41:17.697 --> 41:19.742
Yes, I... Yes.

41:20.420 --> 41:21.963
Okay then.

41:22.630 --> 41:24.647
You do realize
that we're gonna have to undergo

41:24.671 --> 41:26.782
an very rigorous marriage-based
green card interview.

41:26.806 --> 41:27.816
We'll ace it.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.451
Which will require immense

41:29.475 --> 41:32.187
concentration, preparation and study.

41:32.211 --> 41:34.290
- I'm not worried.
- Okay, just don't be cocky,

41:34.314 --> 41:35.491
all right? Not about this.

41:35.515 --> 41:37.026
Whatever you say, Mrs. Magnum.

41:37.050 --> 41:39.194
And don't call me that. Like, ever.

41:39.218 --> 41:40.996
- Okay.
- Ever.
