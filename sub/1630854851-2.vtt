down my legs.

19:43.424 --> 19:44.849
Like, that can't be normal.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.350
It's literally dripping
down my legs.

19:47.578 --> 19:49.261
- No, it's because my thighs
are together,

19:49.414 --> 19:50.521
And I'm standing in the sun.

19:52.433 --> 19:55.842
- Ok.
Just don't get my sweaty legs.

19:55.937 --> 19:58.362
I promise it's not pee.

- Ok.

20:08.524 --> 20:10.266

20:12.194 --> 20:13.436

20:13.529 --> 20:16.047
I can't do it.
Mm-mm, no.

20:16.274 --> 20:17.606
I spent a whole day
at a mall once,

20:17.625 --> 20:18.958
Didn't come home with anything,
and just cried

20:19.110 --> 20:21.052
Because it was so exhausting.

20:21.279 --> 20:24.055
So I'm hoping today
is not like that.

20:24.282 --> 20:26.131
Ok.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.800
You know what?

20:27.952 --> 20:30.286
I never thought I would
be into a ball gown,

20:30.379 --> 20:32.471
But I need to try this one on.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.124

<i> in my life, who,</i>

20:35.217 --> 20:37.142
Even if they've told me
I'm beautiful

20:37.295 --> 20:39.052
And they like me
or whatever it is,

20:39.072 --> 20:41.054
They've never wanted
to commit to me.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.966
So deep down, it's a fear of,
like, what's wrong with me?

20:44.059 --> 20:45.634
<i> And my husband</i>
<i> won't know anything</i>

20:45.728 --> 20:47.653
About me except for my looks.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.731
So if he automatically
is feeling a little nervous

20:50.750 --> 20:53.158
<i> Once he sees me,</i>
<i> my personality might</i>

20:53.253 --> 20:56.754
<i> Scare him on top of already</i>
<i> not liking my looks.</i>

20:56.905 --> 20:58.330
- All right, well,

20:58.424 --> 20:59.757
How about a little cheers
to chris looking good?

20:59.908 --> 21:02.260
- Yeah, loving it.

21:02.411 --> 21:04.670
- How you feeling?
Are you nervous?

21:04.822 --> 21:06.430
- Yeah.

21:06.582 --> 21:08.824
The most scary thing
for me, just,

21:08.843 --> 21:10.417
Like, rejection potentially.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.085
You know, I'm gonna be
standing there waiting for her.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.253
The last thing
I want is for her

21:13.273 --> 21:15.164
To turn and go the other way.

21:15.182 --> 21:17.108
So yeah, you definitely want
to dress to impress.

21:17.259 --> 21:20.002
You definitely want
to make her feel comfortable.

21:20.021 --> 21:22.354
And you know, it's all
about those first impressions.

21:22.507 --> 21:24.189
- And you've always been
such a thoughtful guy.

21:24.342 --> 21:26.525
So I feel like,
as you get to know her,

21:26.677 --> 21:28.193
You're gonna be able
to dial into exactly

21:28.346 --> 21:30.846
What she does want.

21:30.865 --> 21:32.456
- This is not how I imagined
I'd be getting married.

21:32.608 --> 21:34.183
But you know what?

21:34.201 --> 21:35.868
I'm excited to meet my wife.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.521
Let's try on some suits.
- All right, I'm ready.

21:38.539 --> 21:40.706
<i> - In the past, I've had some</i>
<i> women say that I was too nice.</i>

21:40.800 --> 21:42.691
<i> But honestly,</i>
<i> I think that I'm a catch.</i>

21:42.710 --> 21:45.361
<i> I'm very, kind of like</i>

21:45.379 --> 21:47.212

21:47.365 --> 21:49.715
