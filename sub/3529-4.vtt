00:00.595 --> 00:02.594
<i>Previously on "The Tudors"</i>

00:02.596 --> 00:05.096
I plead with you not to put
this agreement in jeopardy

00:05.097 --> 00:06.997
The King will not be moved by words,

00:06.998 --> 00:08.798
but by actions

00:08.799 --> 00:10.299
How is your son, Reginald Pope?

00:10.300 --> 00:13.100
He has more reason than most
to be grateful to your Majesty

00:13.401 --> 00:15.401
These risings, are the greatest chance

00:15.602 --> 00:18.402
restore the true religion to England

00:18.803 --> 00:21.003
Even if that means the
overthrow of the King?

00:21.004 --> 00:23.104
There is another catholic
with a legitimate claim

00:23.405 --> 00:25.305
Of whom do you speak?

00:25.506 --> 00:27.106
I speak of myself

00:27.107 --> 00:28.707
Your Majesty... this is..

00:28.808 --> 00:30.908
My daughter Elizabeth...
You don't need to tell me

00:31.009 --> 00:33.109
The King has taken
Lady Misseldon as mistress

00:33.910 --> 00:36.310
Do not be troubled for me
for I have great reason to be happy

00:36.311 --> 00:38.311
We'd started to gather Mr. Aske

00:38.312 --> 00:41.312
then my lord Suffolk came out of the castle
with their men and broke their spears on us

00:42.313 --> 00:44.613
John Constable you are a principle
and unredeemed traitor

00:44.614 --> 00:46.614
against the King's majesty

00:47.015 --> 00:48.815
Nothing can save you

00:48.816 --> 00:50.916
These wretched men have
threatened my whole realm

00:50.917 --> 00:52.617
as they have threatened me!

00:52.918 --> 00:55.018
They have to, and will be punished for it

00:55.019 --> 00:57.619
I hanged those you were the leaders
and the most guilty in inciting the rest to rebellion

00:57.820 --> 00:59.820
Seventy-four...

01:00.021 --> 01:02.121
Is an inadequate number

01:02.422 --> 01:04.922
I am commanded to return North to kill
hundreds of men, women and children

01:05.123 --> 01:07.123
or lose the love of my King

01:07.224 --> 01:09.624
What if they were your own children?
- I would still have to do it

01:09.924 --> 01:12.424
I think you're with child.
- I am

01:12.525 --> 01:13.925
My Queen

01:14.026 --> 01:17.126
His Majesty has ordered us to arrest Lord Darcy,
Sir Ralph Elleker and Robert Aske

01:17.927 --> 01:22.642
Even after the King's gracious pardon,
you have not changed your traitor's heart

01:22.677 --> 01:25.181
and opinion...
and you still wish to depose the King!

01:25.216 --> 01:28.233
Your Majesty I would never
seek to offend you

01:28.268 --> 01:30.318
I know... but in your heart

01:30.319 --> 01:33.156
you are the most loyal of all men

~ Season 3 - Episode 4 ~
"The Death of a Queen"

02:54.290 --> 02:56.121
Have you dispatched Suffolk
to the North?

02:56.326 --> 02:59.227
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What did you say to him?

02:59.429 --> 03:02.523
I urged him, as a true knight
to his sovereign lord, not to spare...

03:02.732 --> 03:07.066
...but, frankly, to slay
plenty of these false rebels.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.865
I said there was no need for courtesy
in shedding the blood of traitors.

03:11.074 --> 03:12.735
And?

03:13.576 --> 03:15.942
The emperor will shortly be
dispatching an envoy...

03:16.146 --> 03:18.671
...to discuss with Your Majesty
possible candidates...

03:18.882 --> 03:21.146
...for the hand of the Lady Mary.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.685
What do you think of this?

03:27.891 --> 03:30.519
<i>It's the Bucintoro, the doge's ship.</i>

03:30.727 --> 03:34.720
When it is built, the queen
will ride in it to her coronation.

03:34.931 --> 03:38.560
And it will indeed be
a memorable occasion.

03:39.235 --> 03:42.329
Of course, it'll have to wait
till after the birth of my son.

03:42.839 --> 03:44.363
What's that?

03:44.774 --> 03:47.334
This is a pamphlet,
widely distributed.

03:47.544 --> 03:52.311
Its author is Reginald Pole
of Your Majesty's acquaintance...

03:52.515 --> 03:55.848
...who has recently been made
a cardinal by the bishop of Rome.

03:56.052 --> 03:57.747
A cardinal?

03:58.688 --> 04:00.178
What does it say?

04:00.924 --> 04:04.485
It condemns Your Majesty
in the vilest of terms.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.451
As what?

04:07.097 --> 04:09.156
As a heretic...

04:11.901 --> 04:13.698
...and as an adulterer.

04:18.141 --> 04:20.041
So much for gratitude.

04:21.978 --> 04:24.503
Unfortunately, there is more.

04:24.714 --> 04:27.842
My creatures tell me
that the same Cardinal Pole...

04:28.051 --> 04:30.178
...is now in France as papal legate...

04:30.386 --> 04:34.482
...and has been granted
private audience with King Francis.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.125
He's trying to persuade the French
and others...

04:37.327 --> 04:41.787
...to help rekindle the rebellions
against Your Majesty.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.641
Every year, the doge of Venice travels
out in this ship into the lagoon...

04:53.843 --> 04:56.141
...to renew his marriage vows
with the sea.

04:56.846 --> 04:58.939
Marriage with the sea.

04:59.449 --> 05:03.647
What prince does not aspire
to have such an elemental mistress?

05:20.203 --> 05:22.103
Mr. Robert Aske...

05:22.305 --> 05:25.001
...you've been accused
of conspiring to deprive the king...

05:25.208 --> 05:27.733
...of his title of head of the Church...

05:27.944 --> 05:31.675
...of seeking to compel him
to hold a parliament...

05:31.881 --> 05:35.078
...and finally,
of levying war against him...

05:35.285 --> 05:39.881
...all after His Majesty's
gracious pardon was granted.

05:40.890 --> 05:43.950
On all these counts
we find you guilty as charged.

05:45.061 --> 05:46.892
You are to be returned to York...

05:47.096 --> 05:50.623
...where you enjoyed
your most frantic triumph...

05:50.834 --> 05:54.235
...and there hanged in chains
as a punishment...

05:54.437 --> 05:57.736
...for your grievous sins
against His Majesty's Highness...

05:57.941 --> 06:00.068
...and against this realm.

06:10.987 --> 06:13.615
Your horse is ready, Your Grace.

06:18.761 --> 06:19.887
Father.

06:21.364 --> 06:22.388
Son.

06:22.599 --> 06:25.227
I know you will do your duty.

06:26.436 --> 06:27.994
Thank you.

06:28.538 --> 06:31.439
Now, go check on the horses.

06:41.017 --> 06:43.815
I don't ask for your blessing,
Catherine.

06:45.521 --> 06:48.149
Please don't send me away
with your curse.

06:49.592 --> 06:51.958
You're a man of honor.

06:52.762 --> 06:58.200
And I pray to God I shall never have
cause to curse or disoblige you.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.461
But I beg you, show mercy.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.641
Especially to the innocent.

07:20.823 --> 07:23.155
Sir Ralph Ellerker.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.188
Sir Ralph.

07:26.963 --> 07:29.557
You're accused of taking part
in the late insurrection...

07:29.766 --> 07:32.166
...that so wretchedly offended
His King's Majesty...

07:32.368 --> 07:34.563
...and the whole realm.

07:34.904 --> 07:37.429
We have taken account
of your deposition to the court...

07:37.640 --> 07:40.268
...that you joined the rebels
out of fear for your life...

07:40.476 --> 07:42.842
...and the lives of your dependants.

07:43.046 --> 07:46.311
We also note
your subsequent vows of contrition.

07:47.116 --> 07:48.174
We ask you to sign this.

07:49.319 --> 07:50.684
What is it?

07:50.887 --> 07:52.479
An oath.

07:53.823 --> 07:55.620
You swear
that you are heartily sorry...

07:55.825 --> 07:58.851
...that you have offended
the King's Highness in this rebellion.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.826
You promise never again
to make unlawful assembly...

08:02.031 --> 08:06.331
...and also promise to inform against
anyone else who does.

08:06.903 --> 08:12.000
From henceforth you shall be a true
and faithful subject unto our king...

08:12.208 --> 08:15.075
...our sovereign Lord Henry VIII,
king of England and France...

08:15.278 --> 08:17.940
...and on earth, supreme head
of the Church of England...

08:18.147 --> 08:19.739
...so help you God.

08:20.683 --> 08:24.813
And in return,
His Majesty will grant you mercy.

09:05.328 --> 09:07.819
- That one's moving.
- Finish him.

09:13.736 --> 09:15.431
That one.

09:20.343 --> 09:22.903
Make way.
You there, stop what you're doing.

09:23.112 --> 09:26.047
Stop your labors, do you hear?

09:26.249 --> 09:29.741
- In the name of the king, make way.
- Cease your labors.

09:29.952 --> 09:32.318
Get moving, you.

09:32.522 --> 09:35.457
You are traitorous villains,
all of you.

09:35.658 --> 09:40.459
You are bound by law and by nature
to obey the King's Majesty...

09:40.963 --> 09:42.931
...and yet you followed
the traitor Aske...

09:43.132 --> 09:45.828
...and rose in unholy rebellion
against him.

09:46.369 --> 09:48.030
And you...

09:49.472 --> 09:51.599
You betrayed us.

09:54.243 --> 09:55.676
It is my purpose here...

09:55.878 --> 09:58.711
...to show a fearful example
to those who would disobey...

09:58.915 --> 10:01.543
...his most gracious
and sacred Majesty...

10:01.751 --> 10:07.212
...who, after all, in his mercy,
granted you a pardon...

10:07.423 --> 10:10.881
...whereupon you continued
your willful disobedience...

10:11.094 --> 10:12.322
...and traitorous hearts.

10:12.528 --> 10:16.191
For these reasons,
the king will not forgive you.

10:16.766 --> 10:18.825
And neither will God.

10:39.489 --> 10:41.389
Majesty.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.795
Ladies.

10:56.472 --> 10:58.963
Please, don't kill me.

11:14.757 --> 11:19.387
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

11:21.063 --> 11:24.328
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

11:25.168 --> 11:27.728
...on earth as it is in heaven.

11:40.583 --> 11:46.988
Please, Lord, forgive thy poor servant
his trespasses against your flock.

11:59.001 --> 12:02.562
Mr. Aske,
my name is Richard Curwen.

12:02.772 --> 12:06.731
I'm an ordained priest,
and I've come to hear your confession.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.372
May I speak to you honestly,
Mr. Curwen?

12:14.250 --> 12:17.242
Please, do not betray my trust.

12:19.522 --> 12:22.252
Never, Mr. Aske.

12:48.251 --> 12:54.417
Tomorrow, I must beg the forgiveness
not only of His Sacred Majesty...

12:54.624 --> 12:57.787
...but also of Cromwell
and the other heretics.

13:00.396 --> 13:03.160
It sticks in my craw.

13:05.434 --> 13:10.098
Cromwell has openly said
that all of us Northerners were traitors.

13:11.574 --> 13:14.372
It offended me so much.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.638
And then, several times,
he offered me a pardon...

13:18.314 --> 13:21.147
...for confessing the truth.

13:23.486 --> 13:26.148
Cromwell is the devil's messenger,
Mr. Curwen.

13:26.355 --> 13:29.722
And yet I must beg his pardon.

13:32.628 --> 13:35.222
Or else they will hurt my family.

13:35.998 --> 13:38.057
And that I cannot allow.

13:39.168 --> 13:42.695
Bad enough that my wife and children
will see me hanged...

13:42.905 --> 13:45.669
...and left to rot in these chains.

13:46.809 --> 13:51.109
Mr. Aske,
is there anything you need?

13:51.314 --> 13:54.112
Anything I can get you for solace?

13:59.055 --> 14:02.650
There can be no solace, Mr. Curwen.

14:03.693 --> 14:07.254
I will sit here a while and weep.

14:09.065 --> 14:13.525
And thereafter deliver myself
into God's hands...

14:13.736 --> 14:16.102
...and into his loving mercy.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.139
Amen.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.885
Wait.

14:31.554 --> 14:32.578
There is something.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.390
Sewn into my collar there.

14:49.605 --> 14:52.335
I was given that by the Lady Mary.

14:53.976 --> 14:57.810
As you love our cause, Mr. Curwen,
please hand it to my wife.

14:58.013 --> 15:00.743
It will ease her burden greatly.

16:04.146 --> 16:06.171
Her Majesty, the queen.

16:21.263 --> 16:22.662
Sir Francis Bryan.

16:28.037 --> 16:30.437
- Majesty.
- Sir Francis.

16:40.282 --> 16:42.910
Reginald Pole has shown us
his true heart.

16:43.819 --> 16:45.081
I want you to go to Paris...

16:45.855 --> 16:48.050
...protest to the French king
on our behalf...

16:48.257 --> 16:51.124
...for the solemn
and pompous reception granted him.

16:51.660 --> 16:53.389
Majesty.

16:54.363 --> 16:56.729
Ask him to deliver the traitor
into your hands...

16:57.233 --> 17:00.760
...or face the consequences
and our perpetual enmity.

17:03.205 --> 17:04.637
What if the king refuses?

17:08.410 --> 17:11.902
Were you not a spy once,
Sir Francis?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.981
I was, Your Majesty. Indeed.

17:15.384 --> 17:17.079
And a breaker of codes.

17:17.286 --> 17:21.723
Well, perhaps you could revisit
some of your old skills.

17:21.924 --> 17:26.759
I would like nothing better than to have
Pole trussed up and taken to Calais.

17:27.496 --> 17:30.021
And I'd rather alive than dead.

17:43.012 --> 17:44.639
Excuse me.

18:00.229 --> 18:02.993
What is the Lord Privy Seal doing?

18:04.667 --> 18:06.362
I imagine those nobles want to buy...

18:06.569 --> 18:09.037
...the leases of some
of the suppressed abbeys.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.436
What are they giving Mr. Cromwell?

18:13.075 --> 18:14.372
Bribes.

18:15.978 --> 18:18.344
Mr. Cromwell is already a rich man.

18:18.547 --> 18:22.745
- Some say the richest in the kingdom.
- Does the king know of this practice?

18:22.952 --> 18:24.214
He asks no questions.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.154
As long as the crown receives
its 10-percent share.

18:28.223 --> 18:32.250
Is it not terrible that our sacred
building be used like this as profit?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.462
- Lf you say so.
- Then you have...?

18:35.664 --> 18:38.656
You have to understand
how clever it is.

18:38.867 --> 18:42.234
By allowing these new men
to buy a stake in the kingdom...

18:42.838 --> 18:46.774
...Mr. Cromwell makes sure
of their loyalty to the king...

18:46.976 --> 18:48.967
...and to himself.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.572
- Stop.
- I have to go away.

19:20.209 --> 19:23.804
- So?
- So I can't go until I've had you.

19:25.781 --> 19:27.271
This is madness.

19:27.483 --> 19:29.508
I like madness.

19:31.887 --> 19:33.878
No, it's too dangerous.

19:34.089 --> 19:37.889
My husband might see us.
What if I were to conceive your child?

19:38.093 --> 19:41.392
So what? Lots of women lie
about the fathers of their children.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.360
What does it matter to you, huh?

19:43.832 --> 19:46.164
Let Edward raise my brat.

19:47.770 --> 19:51.672
Admit it, lady, this is your game too.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.574
Just do it.

20:18.267 --> 20:19.564
Father.

20:19.768 --> 20:20.928
- Out. Out.
- Father!

20:21.136 --> 20:23.570
For the love of God, take them out.

20:29.011 --> 20:34.313
Oh, my poor husband.
My poor husband. Why?

20:34.750 --> 20:37.548
Why have they done this to you?

20:41.490 --> 20:42.616
Pray for me.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.889
I deserve this.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.130
No. No.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.270
You do not deserve this.

20:56.739 --> 20:58.138
Stop it.

20:59.074 --> 21:01.599
You are a good man, Robert Aske.

21:39.181 --> 21:43.675
I ask you to pray for me,
for I have greatly offended God...

21:44.286 --> 21:47.813
...the king, and the world.

21:49.091 --> 21:53.687
God I have offended by breaking
his commandments in many ways.

21:54.930 --> 21:59.060
And the king I have offended
by breaking his laws...

21:59.268 --> 22:04.331
...to which every true subject
is bound by the commandment of God.

22:04.540 --> 22:08.135
And the world I have offended
since, for my actions...

22:08.343 --> 22:13.337
...so many have lost their lives,
their lands and their goods.

22:14.383 --> 22:16.943
I ask forgiveness
of His Gracious Majesty.

22:17.152 --> 22:22.021
Also my Lord Privy Seal,
my Lord Chancellor.

22:24.726 --> 22:26.353
And my lord of Suffolk...

22:26.862 --> 22:30.628
...whose trespasses against me
I also forgive with a free heart.

22:36.338 --> 22:38.772
And of all the world.

23:10.272 --> 23:14.641
<i>This realm goes
from good peace and quiet daily...</i>

23:14.843 --> 23:16.834
<i>... to better and better.</i>

23:17.045 --> 23:19.946
<i>The traitors have been executed.</i>

23:20.148 --> 23:23.549
<i>The Lord Darcy at Tower Hill.</i>

23:24.086 --> 23:29.319
<i>Aske, hanged above the dungeon
of the castle at York.</i>

23:29.524 --> 23:34.188
<i>The rest were executed at Tyburn.</i>

23:34.396 --> 23:37.797
<i>So that, as far as we can perceive...</i>

23:38.000 --> 23:41.060
<i>... all the cankered hearts...</i>

23:41.270 --> 23:45.730
<i>... are weeded away.</i>

23:59.755 --> 24:02.189
Like this. Exactly.

24:07.095 --> 24:09.029
Sir Francis Bryan.

24:09.231 --> 24:12.860
Let me present myself.
I am Count Talleyrand.

24:13.068 --> 24:15.468
His Majesty King François
has sent me to meet you.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.037
Count, allow me
to present my companion...

24:18.240 --> 24:22.006
...Mr. Thomas Seymour,
brother of the queen of England.

24:23.445 --> 24:27.643
So if the king has sent you, you know
why we have come to France?

24:28.984 --> 24:29.973
I know.

24:30.185 --> 24:33.484
And that we expect your government,
under its treaty obligations...

24:33.689 --> 24:38.490
...to apprehend the rebel Reginald Pole
and deliver him into our custody.

24:39.494 --> 24:41.018
Unfortunately...

24:41.229 --> 24:45.563
...His Majesty already granted
safe passage to this Reginald Pole.

24:45.767 --> 24:50.101
So it would have been dishonorable
for him to hand him over.

24:50.305 --> 24:54.435
Nevertheless, he promised your king
by letter, 10 days ago...

24:54.643 --> 24:57.771
...that he would expel this Pole.

24:57.980 --> 25:00.949
- And so he did.
- Then where is Pole now?

25:01.416 --> 25:05.477
All I know is that he was allowed
to travel to Caserta...

25:05.687 --> 25:07.621
...under the emperor jurisdiction.

25:12.761 --> 25:16.754
It seems to me that your manner
of proceeding has been very strange.

25:16.965 --> 25:20.093
I fear it may lose your master
the friendship of mine.

25:21.870 --> 25:22.962
Now, I'm hungry.

25:24.072 --> 25:25.869
Good evening, count.

25:26.975 --> 25:28.272
Good evening, Sir Francis.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.910
<i>Oh, and bonne vacance.</i>

25:38.186 --> 25:41.678
Gentlemen, your meal, if you please.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.456
Yes, very pretty.

25:52.667 --> 25:57.229
So where's Caserta?
Forgive my ignorance.

25:57.439 --> 26:00.772
In Italy. North of Naples.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.910
It's a nice old town.

26:03.779 --> 26:07.078
I tell you this, Tom, if we find Pole,
I will not truss him up.

26:09.084 --> 26:10.881
I'm gonna kill him
with my own hands.

26:16.058 --> 26:17.218
Your Majesty.

26:17.426 --> 26:20.953
His Excellency,
Ambassador Eustace Chapuys.

26:23.932 --> 26:25.229
Excellency.

26:27.235 --> 26:28.759
Your Majesties.

26:28.970 --> 26:31.438
The emperor sends you his love.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.108
And he has charged me
with the grave responsibility...

26:34.309 --> 26:36.436
...of negotiating with Your Majesty...

26:36.645 --> 26:40.103
...a suitable marriage
for your daughter, the Lady Mary.

26:40.315 --> 26:41.839
Who does the king propose?

26:42.050 --> 26:46.043
His Highness Don Luis,
the heir to the throne of Portugal...

26:46.254 --> 26:48.882
...and the brother
of the emperor's wife, Isabella.

26:49.091 --> 26:52.083
What type of man is he,
this Don Luis?

26:52.294 --> 26:55.263
He is in every way a paragon.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.397
A man of great integrity and virtue.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.626
A man who has fought
military campaigns and won.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.237
A man with a profound knowledge
of the world.

27:04.439 --> 27:06.999
My daughter has no knowledge
of the world.

27:07.209 --> 27:10.474
She's an ingénue, an innocent.

27:10.679 --> 27:13.409
And she is a very spiritual person.

27:14.149 --> 27:16.276
How will this Don Luis treat her?

27:18.120 --> 27:19.485
Like a nun.

27:22.290 --> 27:26.124
In which case, alas, it may be difficult
for them to produce children.

27:31.933 --> 27:33.730
Excellency.

27:45.280 --> 27:49.808
The emperor has suggested
a splendid offer for your hand.

27:50.018 --> 27:53.249
His Highness Don Luis
is 24 years old...

27:53.455 --> 27:57.949
...from a very rich
and distinguished family.

28:00.362 --> 28:01.556
Go on.

28:01.763 --> 28:06.496
I am told he is a great favorite
at the imperial court.

28:07.669 --> 28:10.695
With women?

28:11.072 --> 28:12.835
With everyone.

28:13.041 --> 28:18.001
Because he is so honorable
and gallant and good-natured.

28:19.381 --> 28:23.442
Is he good-Iooking?

28:24.019 --> 28:25.509
Yes.

28:26.087 --> 28:28.146
I have seen him myself.

28:28.356 --> 28:34.522
He is tall, with very dark hair,
but piercing blue eyes.

28:37.232 --> 28:40.099
I am sure that your mother...
God rest her soul.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.167
- Would have approved.

28:47.108 --> 28:49.838
And everyone at court
is talking about you.

28:50.045 --> 28:52.809
They say the queen
has persuaded His Majesty...

28:53.014 --> 28:55.744
...to reinstate you to the succession.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.316
Poor Robert Aske.

29:06.795 --> 29:12.062
I was told his body is still hanging,
trimmed in chains, for all to see.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.863
I should not be thinking
of my own happiness.

29:16.071 --> 29:19.973
Sweet madam,
you have every right to think of it.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.478
<i>Your Graces.</i>

29:24.679 --> 29:28.638
As head of the Church, I am vexed
by your inability to agree...

29:28.850 --> 29:31.944
...on the fundamental issues
of doctrine and practice.

29:32.621 --> 29:34.953
I listen to your sermons.

29:35.156 --> 29:38.853
And sometimes I find them full
of evangelical excesses...

29:39.060 --> 29:41.153
...which have never been
agreed upon...

29:41.363 --> 29:45.026
...and have no place
in the Church of England.

29:46.701 --> 29:51.400
Your Graces, I want unity
and agreement in our Church.

29:51.606 --> 29:54.598
I want diversity of opinion ended...

29:54.809 --> 29:58.301
...and uniformity imposed.

29:59.347 --> 30:04.046
Therefore, I command you to establish
a commission amongst yourselves...

30:04.252 --> 30:08.313
...to determine the basic articles
of our faith.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.586
It's Her Majesty.

30:15.130 --> 30:16.620
Majesty.

30:16.831 --> 30:18.958
- What is it?
- Majesty.

30:19.601 --> 30:22.161
- Sweetheart, what is it?
- Majesty.

30:22.370 --> 30:24.395
Everything's all right.

30:24.606 --> 30:26.073
Come.

30:32.514 --> 30:34.209
Can you feel it?

30:36.117 --> 30:37.516
It's moving.

30:38.787 --> 30:40.550
It's kicking.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.020
I can feel it.

30:44.225 --> 30:46.420
Oh, he feels strong.

30:53.168 --> 30:57.002
Edward, my son.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.673
Be strong.

31:16.057 --> 31:18.321
Crown I catch the next one.

31:32.741 --> 31:34.834
What is it, Father?

31:37.912 --> 31:39.675
Can't you see him?

31:39.881 --> 31:41.041
See who?

31:41.649 --> 31:43.241
Over there.

31:44.419 --> 31:46.046
Can't you see him?

31:48.123 --> 31:49.988
Well, look.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.828
Tell me you can see him.

31:58.733 --> 32:00.633
That man.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.564
He's there.

32:06.841 --> 32:08.604
You can see him, can't you?

32:11.679 --> 32:13.476
Oh, for God's sake,
do you see him?

32:14.616 --> 32:18.279
In a while,
the queen will come to full term.

32:18.486 --> 32:21.887
I want you to organize the celebrations
for the birth of my son.

32:22.090 --> 32:25.719
- I would be honored.
- I want them to be truly spectacular.

32:25.927 --> 32:28.259
Te Deums
and bonfires throughout the kingdom...

32:28.463 --> 32:31.694
...and free wine for everyone.
And a tournament.

32:31.900 --> 32:35.495
I had planned a tournament for the
birth of the prince with my last queen...

32:35.703 --> 32:37.102
...but it had to be canceled.

32:37.305 --> 32:41.139
Well, this time, Your Majesty
will have no reason to cancel it.

32:42.544 --> 32:46.537
May I ask Your Majesty's opinion
on another matter?

32:46.748 --> 32:48.045
In the recent rebellion...

32:48.249 --> 32:50.911
...which, thank God,
Your Majesty has now suppressed...

32:51.119 --> 32:53.849
...and the worst rascals
properly put to death...

32:54.055 --> 32:57.650
...a great cause was made by some
against the Lord Privy Seal...

32:58.193 --> 33:02.220
...who, in some quarters,
was blamed for it.

33:02.430 --> 33:08.801
Frankly, we thought him in danger,
whilst trusting he was not.

33:16.478 --> 33:20.574
It was the rebels
who demanded Mr. Cromwell's head.

33:20.782 --> 33:24.377
And by doing so, they saved it.

33:30.892 --> 33:32.655
Beautiful.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.894
- Yes, Lady Rochford?
- Majesty.

33:38.299 --> 33:40.767
Lady Lisle has written to me
asking if Your Majesty...

33:40.969 --> 33:44.132
...might find a place in your household
for one of her two daughters.

33:44.339 --> 33:47.502
- I told her I'd mention it to you.
- Have you warned the Lady Lisle...

33:47.709 --> 33:51.543
...that life at court is full of pride,
envy, scorn, and derision?

33:52.113 --> 33:55.480
If you have, then have her send them
to me, and I'll choose one of them.

33:55.683 --> 33:58.243
And remember,
they must bring two sets of clothes...

33:58.453 --> 34:01.513
...one of satin, the other of damask.
- Madam.

34:04.225 --> 34:05.487
Lady Misseldon.

34:05.693 --> 34:09.458
Help me unlace my gown.
It seems to grow tighter by the hour.

34:14.002 --> 34:18.496
If anything should happen to me,
be a comfort to His Majesty.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.034
Majesty.

34:24.579 --> 34:26.478
My little...

34:26.681 --> 34:29.775
Do not be alarmed, ladies,
but I think my time has come.

34:30.418 --> 34:32.386
- Lady Mary.
- Majesty.

34:32.587 --> 34:36.023
Please swear that you will stay
with me now and not forsake me.

34:36.224 --> 34:38.021
I do promise.

34:38.226 --> 34:39.716
Then all will be well.

34:39.928 --> 34:41.862
Go fetch the midwife.

34:43.197 --> 34:44.755
Come to the bed.

34:44.966 --> 34:46.489
Majesty?

34:47.735 --> 34:50.761
- Well? Is it time?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

34:54.074 --> 34:56.134
- Send my physician to watch over her.
- Yes.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.641
And fetch my Lord Beauchamp.

34:57.845 --> 34:59.506
- And Bishop Gardiner.
- Majesty.

34:59.714 --> 35:03.150
And send some heralds into the city
to tell them the news.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.818
And Cromwell.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.544
Tell Mr. Cromwell. Tell him...

35:08.056 --> 35:10.820
Tell him that whole worlds
hang in the balance.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.550
It's happening. It's happening.

35:13.761 --> 35:17.219
I pray Jesu, if he wills,
to send us a prince.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.130
Take my hand.

35:25.506 --> 35:27.406
Let me have a look now.

35:37.919 --> 35:40.820
Breathe deep, Your Majesty.
Good. Good.

35:41.022 --> 35:43.684
- Lady Mary.
- Yes, madam?

35:43.891 --> 35:45.324
The box.

36:05.947 --> 36:07.676
It used to belong to your mother.

36:09.951 --> 36:11.384
I think she is here with us.

36:14.922 --> 36:17.982
I believe with all my heart
she will help you.

36:27.035 --> 36:29.936
Almighty and everlasting God...

36:30.471 --> 36:33.929
...mercifully look upon
our infirmities...

36:34.142 --> 36:37.407
...and in all our dangers
and necessities...

36:37.612 --> 36:44.074
...stretch forth thy right hand
to help us and defend us.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.378
Through Christ our Lord.

36:48.756 --> 36:51.987
You've got to help push.
Have faith in yourself.

36:55.997 --> 36:57.760
Good, Your Majesty.

37:05.139 --> 37:08.905
Tomorrow, there will be
a solemn procession through the city...

37:09.110 --> 37:13.570
...all to pray for the queen
if she is still in labor with child.

37:14.982 --> 37:18.315
If she is still in labor with child,
God help us.

37:20.888 --> 37:23.220
I think to lose them both.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.930
I am reconciled with God.

38:04.932 --> 38:07.526
I've done nothing
against my conscience.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.510
To serve the king is to serve God.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.607
I am with child.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.666
She is no better.

38:45.006 --> 38:47.236
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

38:47.441 --> 38:49.102
Blessed art thou amongst women...

38:49.310 --> 38:51.540
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.977
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

38:55.183 --> 38:57.617
...now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

39:03.491 --> 39:04.958
Please, my lady, don't give up.

39:05.159 --> 39:08.094
Please, for the love of Jesus,
don't give up.

39:13.568 --> 39:16.401
<i>Your Majesty,
I talked to the physicians.</i>

39:16.604 --> 39:19.300
<i>In their opinion,
there is not a great deal of time left.</i>

39:20.341 --> 39:21.865
The baby is likely to die...

39:22.076 --> 39:26.137
...unless they cut open
the queen's belly to release it.

39:26.347 --> 39:31.614
In which case, it is almost certain
that she herself will die.

39:35.089 --> 39:41.494
Your Majesty may thus have to decide
soon between the life of the mother...

39:42.630 --> 39:44.791
...or of the child.

40:26.173 --> 40:27.936
Let me pass.

40:37.451 --> 40:39.009
Your Majesty.

40:52.500 --> 40:56.800
Her Majesty is delivered
of a healthy son.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.370
I have a son?

41:09.583 --> 41:11.312
I have a son.

41:11.519 --> 41:15.615
Yes, Your Majesty, you have a son.

41:37.311 --> 41:39.677
The future king of England.

42:05.806 --> 42:08.104
Blessed sweet child.

42:26.627 --> 42:30.393
Edward, our son.

42:31.165 --> 42:35.727
Bless you, child,
in the name of God...

42:36.237 --> 42:41.004
...the Virgin Mary and Saint George.

43:00.061 --> 43:02.154
He's a sweet prince.

43:02.363 --> 43:03.728
Yes, he is.

43:03.931 --> 43:05.592
And he's our brother.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.859
The king has waited a long time
for a son.

43:08.335 --> 43:10.200
But he still loves us.

43:11.739 --> 43:15.038
A boy is more important, Elizabeth.

43:15.443 --> 43:17.104
I don't think so.

43:26.020 --> 43:32.482
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost...

43:33.360 --> 43:35.487
...I baptize thee, Edward.

43:35.696 --> 43:39.530
May God bless and keep you
all the days of your life...

43:39.733 --> 43:46.036
...and give you abundantly his grace.
Through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.333
Amen.

43:48.776 --> 43:52.143
God, of his almighty
and infinite grace...

43:52.346 --> 43:55.975
...give and grant good life and long
to the right high...

43:56.183 --> 43:59.277
...right excellent
and noble Prince Edward...

43:59.487 --> 44:02.081
...duke of Cornwall
and earl of Chester...

44:02.289 --> 44:04.780
...most dear
and entirely beloved son...

44:04.992 --> 44:09.691
...to our most dread and gracious lord,
King Henry VIII.

44:13.100 --> 44:16.160
The queen's health has rapidly
deteriorated. Yesterday evening...

44:16.370 --> 44:19.862
...she had a loosening of the bowels,
and we felt sure we could save her.

44:20.374 --> 44:24.367
But during the night,
her fever grew worse again.

44:24.578 --> 44:28.014
We have tried everything we know.

44:28.215 --> 44:32.345
But Her Majesty
continues to weaken.

44:39.426 --> 44:40.984
Majesty.

44:48.802 --> 44:50.827
It's childbed fever.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.506
I know because my mother died of it.

44:58.746 --> 44:59.872
Get out.

45:01.615 --> 45:03.310
Leave.

45:06.587 --> 45:08.521
Majesty.

45:08.722 --> 45:10.485
Majesty.

46:08.282 --> 46:10.147
Don't go.

46:11.986 --> 46:15.547
Please, don't go.

46:16.657 --> 46:20.684
Just because you have done
everything that you've promised...

46:20.894 --> 46:23.260
...please don't leave me.

46:26.967 --> 46:30.334
You are the milk of human kindness.

46:31.939 --> 46:35.238
The light in my dark, dark world.

46:40.080 --> 46:43.072
Without you, life is a desert.

46:44.618 --> 46:47.781
A howling wilderness.

46:54.928 --> 46:59.888
Please, God, in your mercy...

47:00.801 --> 47:03.599
...don't take her away from me.

47:07.241 --> 47:10.176
My son needs his mother.

47:12.446 --> 47:14.812
And I need my queen.
