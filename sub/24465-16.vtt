Mordecai: ( CHUCKLES )
OVER A GARBAGE HOUSEBOAT,

00:30.680 --> 00:33.280
OBVIOUSLY.
IT'D SMELL BAD, AND THEN THE

Eileen: RIGHT.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.040
IT'S NOT A LEGITIMATE DARE
WITHOUT A CREDIBLE WITNESS.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.920
Rigby: FINE.
I'LL BE THE INCREDIBLE WITNESS.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.700

06:36.760 --> 06:39.720
PERMISSION TO SPEAK FREELY,
SIR?

06:38.000 --> 06:38.460
GRANTED.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.580
SIR, WHY DO WE TEST THE

06:39.680 --> 06:42.840
SATELLITE LASER ON PORTABLE
TOILETS, SIR?

06:41.600 --> 06:44.840
WHY DO WE TEST ON PORTABLE
TOILETS?!

06:43.480 --> 06:46.760
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO STOP THE
ENEMIES AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.440
ENEMIES AND PORTABLE TOILETS
HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON ââ

06:48.720 --> 06:50.020
THEY'RE BOTH SOULLESS AND

06:50.120 --> 06:53.360
THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE.
CAN NEVER BE TOO SAFE, SIR.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.900
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.340
NOW, I DO NOT FEEL LIKE BEING

06:55.440 --> 06:57.020
INTIMIDATED TODAY, SO LET'S PUT

06:57.120 --> 06:58.740
SOME TAXPAYER MONEY TO GOOD USE.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.220
BEGIN LASER SEQUENCE!

07:00.320 --> 07:02.800
( BEEPING )

07:06.960 --> 07:08.660
3...2...1.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.220
LET'S DROP A LASERâGUIDED

07:10.320 --> 07:12.220
NUMBER 2 ON THIS TURD BUCKET.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.320
( CLICK )

07:19.800 --> 07:22.280
( BOTH SCREAM )
Rigby: HURRY UP AND HELP US!

07:21.280 --> 07:24.200
Mordecai: YOU GUYS GOT TO
COME QUICK!

07:22.760 --> 07:25.600
WE'RE GONNA DIE OUT ââ
( ELECTRICITY CRACKLES )

07:25.560 --> 07:26.660
WE LOST THEM!

07:26.760 --> 07:28.760
( BOTH GASP )

07:30.320 --> 07:32.480
I'LL TRY AND FLAG THEM DOWN!

07:37.160 --> 07:38.860
( VOCALIZING )

07:38.960 --> 07:39.860
Eileen: ( SCOFFS )

07:39.960 --> 07:40.900
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.340
Eileen: MY SIGNALS AREN'T

07:42.440 --> 07:43.060
WORKING!

07:43.160 --> 07:44.020
NO!

07:44.120 --> 07:45.220
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

07:45.320 --> 07:46.540
THIS IS TERRIBLE!

07:46.640 --> 07:48.220
Eileen: TRY AND KEEP CALM.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.660
KEEP CALM?!

07:49.760 --> 07:51.300
FINALLY THINGS STOP BEING WEIRD

07:51.400 --> 07:52.660
WITH MORDECAI, AND NOW HE'S

07:52.760 --> 07:54.300
GONNA GET KILLED, AND IT'S ALL

07:54.400 --> 07:55.660
BECAUSE OF SOME STUPID DARE

07:55.760 --> 07:57.140
WHICH WASN'T EVEN CLEVER.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.140
Eileen: C.J.!

07:58.240 --> 07:59.620
( WHIRRING )

07:59.720 --> 08:01.100
DO YOU TRUST ME?

08:01.200 --> 08:01.860
YEAH.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.820
Eileen: WOULD YOU RATHER LET

08:03.920 --> 08:05.820
MORDECAI AND RIGBY GET KILLED OR

08:05.920 --> 08:07.740
JUMP INTO THAT PORTABLE TOILET

08:07.840 --> 08:09.580
AND RESCUE THEM?

08:09.680 --> 08:10.700
( INHALES DEEPLY )

08:10.800 --> 08:12.800
THAT'S EASY.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.720
Rigby: I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
OPEN THIS FOR SO LONG, I CAN'T

08:17.960 --> 08:20.640
FEEL MY ARMS.
( Sarcastically ) THANK YOU,

08:19.920 --> 08:21.060
MORDECAI!

08:21.160 --> 08:24.160
Mordecai: HEY, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO CLOSE THE DOOR.

08:23.080 --> 08:26.160
Rigby: DON'T PUT THIS ON <i>ME,</i>
MAN!

08:24.440 --> 08:27.720
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO FLIRTS BY
TAKING TOILET DARES!

08:26.880 --> 08:29.640
Mordecai: QUIET!
( INDISTINCT ARGUING )

08:36.600 --> 08:37.740

08:37.840 --> 08:38.780
CONTINUE TESTING.

08:38.880 --> 08:39.500
OH, NO.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.640
NO.
PERMISSION TO SPEAK FREELY,

08:42.520 --> 08:44.840
SIR?
GRANTED.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.560
DIDN'T THE PRESIDENT SAY TO
LIMIT TESTING BECAUSE EACH BLAST

08:45.680 --> 08:47.060
COSTS $3 BILLION?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.340
THE PRESIDENT'S NOT MY

08:48.440 --> 08:48.980
FATHER!

08:49.080 --> 08:50.460
I'LL BLOW UP AS MANY TOILETS AS

08:50.560 --> 08:51.100
I LIKE!

08:51.200 --> 08:53.220
NOW CONTINUE TESTING!

08:53.320 --> 08:53.900
( BEEPING )

08:54.000 --> 08:55.140
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?

08:55.240 --> 08:58.020
Eileen: UH...NONE!

08:58.120 --> 08:59.140
THEY GOT TO BE HERE

08:59.240 --> 08:59.860

08:59.960 --> 09:02.020
COME ON!

09:02.120 --> 09:03.660
Eileen: WE NEED TO SPLIT UP.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.360

09:10.560 --> 09:12.560
OH! THANKS, LADY!

09:13.560 --> 09:16.400
Eileen: ANY LUCK?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.180
Rigby: WE'RE RIGHT HERE!

09:16.280 --> 09:18.660
( BOTH GRUNTING )

09:18.760 --> 09:19.700
Eileen: ( GRUNTS )

09:19.800 --> 09:20.660

09:20.760 --> 09:21.580
GET THE TOOLS.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.120

09:35.520 --> 09:36.100
ON MY MARK.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.420
Both: 3...2...1...

09:39.520 --> 09:41.520
Mordecai: RUN!

09:48.680 --> 09:49.980
WHAT WERE YOU KIDS THINKING?!

09:50.080 --> 09:51.460
YOU'RE LUCKY WE SAW YOUR HEAT

09:51.560 --> 09:54.640
SIGNATURES SO WE COULD
DISTINGUISH YOU FROM THE DEBRIS.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.620
SIR, THE PRESIDENT'S ON THE

09:55.720 --> 09:56.180
LINE.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.460

09:58.200 --> 10:01.320

PRETTY HARD.
C.J. JUMPED INTO A MOVING

HELICOPTER.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.020
Mordecai: WOW. REALLY?

10:07.120 --> 10:08.260
WELL, YOU KNOW, MORE LIKE A

10:08.360 --> 10:11.800
