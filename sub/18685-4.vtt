WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:04.172
(P.A. beeps)

00:04.205 --> 00:05.806
DR. FRENKEL: Well, it doesn't
take a genius to see

00:05.839 --> 00:08.176
Ben's veered off
the food pyramid.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.811
Mind telling us what
you've been swallowing?

00:10.844 --> 00:14.315
Not a whole lot-- a tack,
a pencil sharpener,

00:14.348 --> 00:16.050
you got cabinet knobs,

00:16.084 --> 00:18.886
some matches, Alba's mood ring.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.054
Okay, enough with
the guessing game,

00:20.088 --> 00:21.089
I'm freaking out over here.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.390
Can you just tell me
how bad it is?

00:22.423 --> 00:24.658
Ben, can you go play
in the waiting area,

00:24.692 --> 00:26.527
so I can have a word
with your aunt?

00:26.560 --> 00:28.229
Okay.
Thanks.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.430
It'll just be a minute,
sweetie.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.531
(door opens, then closes)

00:30.564 --> 00:31.399
Physically, Ben's fine.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.733
The kid's got
an iron stomach

00:32.766 --> 00:34.902
so as long as
he passes the objects

00:34.935 --> 00:36.237
there should be no problem.
Really?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.571
Oh, that's great.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.773
This is awesome news,
thank you.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.442
I wouldn't say
it's awesome.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.544
This is more telling
of a psychological issue.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.347
Has Ben been undergone
any recent trauma?

00:46.380 --> 00:50.218
I mean, barring his
parents getting arrested

00:50.251 --> 00:53.254
and fleeing the country
without saying good-bye,

00:53.287 --> 00:56.056
I-- nothing comes to mind.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.226
I see he burnt
his taste buds off.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.261
Right, yeah, that.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.963
Forgot about that one.
That happened.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.065
Listen, I get you're new
to this whole parenting thing,

01:05.099 --> 01:07.401
but do you think
you're up to the task?

01:07.435 --> 01:10.037
Yeah, totally. It's just--
it's been a little bit

01:10.070 --> 01:12.306
of an adjustment period, but
I can-I can do this, I got this.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.774
I got it, right?

01:16.744 --> 01:19.247
It's not all bad-- I see
he had a birthday last week.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.115
You guys do anything fun?

01:22.983 --> 01:25.619
Mm-hmm.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.155
Where are my keys?

01:27.188 --> 01:28.189
Just had them.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.127
Oh, come on!

01:33.161 --> 01:34.462
(sighs)
All right.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.096
(grunts)

01:36.130 --> 01:37.931
(car alarm chirps)

01:37.965 --> 01:39.833
Get in.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.503
(man speaks indistinctly on TV)

01:42.536 --> 01:44.838
MAN: ...got his residence.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.341
WOMAN: What are you gonna do
when you find him?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.609
MAN: I mean, he's been on the
streets for how many years now?

01:48.642 --> 01:50.911
WOMAN: As long
as we've been part--

01:50.944 --> 01:52.613
(TV turns off)
Hey!
What the hell?

01:52.646 --> 01:54.348
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you watching that?

01:54.382 --> 01:56.116
Is that why you were
too busy to remember

01:56.150 --> 01:57.117
you little brothers' birthday?

01:57.151 --> 01:58.352
Oh, yikes.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.020
Oh...
Ay bendito.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.622
I mean, at least I'm new around
here, you're his siblings.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.292
Hey, don't put this on us, okay?
That was Mom's job.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.526
So was paying taxes.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.827
She wasn't doing
a real bang-up job

02:06.860 --> 02:08.329
of that either.
Seriously, though,

02:08.362 --> 02:09.963
do you guys ever think about
anybody but yourselves?

02:09.997 --> 02:11.432
JIMMY:
She's right.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.767
You really dropped the ball
on this one.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.937
I'm sorry,
who is this derelict

02:16.970 --> 02:18.172
and why is he
still here?

02:18.206 --> 02:19.273
Yeah, time to
go home, dude.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.941
Hey! Back off.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.710
Jimmy's my guy
and I say he stays.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.378
Oh yeah?
He's your boyfriend?

02:24.412 --> 02:25.646
Yeah.
No, he is my guy.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.880
We don't do labels.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.449
But I'm-I'm am not opposed
to a label.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.518
Shut up, Jimmy.
You guys suck.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.620
We never forgot little Ben's
birthday before you showed up.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.621
SABRINA: Yeah, you're
the one who's always

02:33.654 --> 02:35.356
babbling on about
how you're the boss.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.357
I am the boss.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.625
Well, then act like one.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.859
Fine.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.228
I will fix this myself.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.629
Yeah, take a mulligan.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.231
You tell him it's his birthday
this weekend,

02:43.264 --> 02:45.065
he's not gonna know
the difference.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.500
See?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.536
There we go, Jimmy,
that's my guy.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.571
Thank you.
All right, what'd you guys
do for birthdays

02:50.604 --> 02:52.139
around here
when you were his age?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.208
Uh, well, I flew 15 of my
closest friends to Paris

02:54.242 --> 02:55.809
for Fashion Week.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.379
I took batting practice
at Yankee Stadium.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.147
Gross.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.851
*

03:03.884 --> 03:06.487
Hey, buddy.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.989
What you doing?

03:09.022 --> 03:11.259
Uh, he seems to be
staring at a wall.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.226
(quietly):
Yeah.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.927
Oh, no, hey, hey, hey.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.397
Hock it up, come on.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.499
Ugh! See what
we're dealing with?
JIMMY: Yeah.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.534
Hey, Ben, buddy,

03:20.568 --> 03:23.371
we got a surprise
for you, okay?

03:23.404 --> 03:26.173
It's your birthday! Ah!
Oh!

03:26.206 --> 03:27.675
Really?
SABRINA:
Yeah.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.344
How old am I turning?

03:30.378 --> 03:32.580
Come on... what?
No, that's on him,
he's got to know that.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.181
MICKEY:
Well,

03:34.214 --> 03:36.350
ni... nine?

03:36.384 --> 03:37.351
No. Ten...

03:37.385 --> 03:38.852
Let's go with seven.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.087
(chuckles)
Seven, you silly goose.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.523
SABRINA: Yeah!
Congratulations!

03:42.556 --> 03:44.592
So, what do you want
at your party this weekend?

03:44.625 --> 03:46.694
Will Mommy and
Daddy be there?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.430
Oh, gosh, uh, no, uh,
misunderstanding.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.132
(nervous chuckle) I was
thinking more along the lines

03:52.165 --> 03:53.434
of, like, a theme.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.869
Oh. How about a Mommy
and Daddy theme?

03:55.903 --> 03:59.573
Uh, buddy,
I just want to know

03:59.607 --> 04:01.742
what kind of stuff you like.

04:01.775 --> 04:02.643
Uh, lots of stuff.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.977
Mice,
Uh-huh.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.146
My Mini Pony dolls,

04:06.179 --> 04:07.881
syrup,

04:07.915 --> 04:09.116
the Iraq War,

04:09.149 --> 04:10.384
getting rolled up
in the carpet

04:10.418 --> 04:11.885
like a taquito.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.920
Yeah!
(chuckles)

04:12.953 --> 04:14.655
I mean, who doesn't?

04:14.688 --> 04:15.723
This kid.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.057
Thank you.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.592
That gives us a real good
jumping-off point,

04:18.626 --> 04:19.827
buddy, right?
JIMMY: Yeah.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.896
Get ready for
the best party ever. Whoo!

04:22.930 --> 04:25.265
(softly):
Yeah. Let's go.

04:25.299 --> 04:29.169
*

04:29.202 --> 04:32.139
Let's do that kid a favor
and not do any of that stuff.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.007
Why don't we just stick with
what's worked millions of years,

04:34.041 --> 04:35.409
cake, clowns, balloons?

04:35.443 --> 04:37.811
Yeah, if it's not broke,
you don't fix it.

04:37.845 --> 04:41.081
Oh, what's the name of the clown
that everyone got growing up?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.350
Sully?
Yeah.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.617
Sully the Clown!

04:43.651 --> 04:44.918
That guy's the best.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.320
What, a clown?
Sounds pretty lame.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.588
No, not this guy.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.357
He's like the Mick Jagger
of clowns.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.392
We find somebody half as good
as Sully, we are in business.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.429
MICKEY: One more time.
ALMA: One, two, three, hit it!

04:55.463 --> 04:57.698
(rapping):
* Ha-ppy birth-day
(Alma hums along)

04:57.731 --> 05:00.033
* Gonna blow out all the candles
on your birthday *

05:00.067 --> 05:02.603
* And we wish we knew
the age of your birthday *

05:02.636 --> 05:05.105
BOTH: *'Cause people should know
the kids' birthday! *

05:05.138 --> 05:07.274
Wika-ow!
I like what
you're adding at the end.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.377
I-I like it. I think it's good.
It really puts
a nice spin on it.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.978
It's nice.
You know what?
We're gonna shove this party

05:11.011 --> 05:12.880
on their stupid faces.
Ugh. Oh.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.449
What the hell is this?
(kids screaming and laughing)

05:15.483 --> 05:16.684
What are all those balloons?

05:16.717 --> 05:18.218
There's so many.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.889
(gasps)
Oh... no, no.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.156
Oh!

05:23.190 --> 05:25.526
(carnival music playing)

05:25.559 --> 05:26.927
(kids laughing, chattering)

05:32.099 --> 05:33.367
(cake thuds)

05:35.536 --> 05:38.672
Well, no one's
gonna miss that.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.578
SABRINA:
Hey, so glad you could make it.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.246
What the hell is this?

05:46.279 --> 05:48.015
Well, we decided we couldn't let

05:48.048 --> 05:50.250
Ben's name be on the marquee
of your crap fest,

05:50.283 --> 05:52.886
so we stepped up and threw him
the party he deserves.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.922
I thought we agreed
I'm the boss.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.190
No, if you saw my silence
as agreeing with you,

05:57.224 --> 05:58.392
that's on you.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.993
Well, what happened
to keeping it basic?

06:00.027 --> 06:02.696
We did. We basically
threw the best party ever.

06:02.730 --> 06:06.434
Too bad Ben couldn't
care less about it.
What?
Hmm?

06:06.467 --> 06:09.102
SABRINA:
Come on, he's surrounded by
ten grand in gourmet candy,

06:09.136 --> 06:10.337
and he's eating crayons?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.572
Yeah, well, don't take it
personally,

06:11.605 --> 06:13.340
his heart just
isn't for sale.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.042
JIMMY:
Ho!

06:15.075 --> 06:18.045
(claps) Whoo!
Sully in the house!
MICKEY: What?

06:18.078 --> 06:21.014
Who the hell is this guy?
What do you mean? It's Sully

06:21.048 --> 06:22.850
Sully, who?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.084
The Sully?
Yeah.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.253
I looked him up.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.188
But, Jimmy, I told you to
get somebody like Sully.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.023
No, I know, I heard you
and I did you one better.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.124
Got the real McCoy.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.593
MICKEY: Yeah, but this guy
looks like hell.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.361
Oh, you should've seen him
an hour ago.
Ugh.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.797
JIMMY: I gave him some coffee,
he perked right up.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.231
Your guy really
came through, huh?

06:38.265 --> 06:39.433
CHIP:
This is the clown

06:39.467 --> 06:41.134
you were so excited about?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.370
The name's Sully
the Spectacular.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.905
Yeah, spectacularly stupid.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.139
JIMMY:
Hey!

06:46.173 --> 06:47.407
You're in
the presence of greatness.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.642
It's cool.

06:48.676 --> 06:49.877
I get it.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.212
I'm an unproven entity.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.547
Let's see now...

06:53.581 --> 06:55.115
(all yell in astonishment)

06:55.148 --> 06:56.984
Oh...
Oh!
Oh!

06:57.017 --> 06:59.052
Did you just rip
a bird out of the sky?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.888
Yeah, he did,
impressed now?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.390
Yeah, I mean obviously my...
(stammers)

07:03.423 --> 07:06.259
That's the dopest thing
I've ever seen!
(chuckles)

07:06.293 --> 07:07.628
Is that even a trick?

07:07.661 --> 07:09.730
Yeah, I doubt the bird
liked it. (scoffs)

07:09.763 --> 07:11.231
What bird?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.265
Ooh!
(Chip gasps)

07:12.299 --> 07:14.668
(laughing)

07:14.702 --> 07:16.269
(Mickey laughs)
Wow!

07:16.303 --> 07:18.238
Yes! Yeah!
Yeah!
CHIP: What?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.940
Wha... what?

07:19.973 --> 07:22.175
Wow, is that clown for me?!

07:22.209 --> 07:23.677
MICKEY: You better
believe it, buddy.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.579
Go round up the troops
and meet me in the living room

07:25.613 --> 07:27.848
if you want to have your minds
blown out of your butts

07:27.881 --> 07:29.617
by Sully the Spectacular.
Cool.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.819
Hey, everyone!

07:31.852 --> 07:33.854
Come inside if you want
to have your butts blown

07:33.887 --> 07:35.789
by a freaking clown!

07:35.823 --> 07:36.857
(kids cheering)

07:36.890 --> 07:38.125
Yeah.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.326
All right,

07:39.359 --> 07:40.794
I don't get my hands
on a slice of cake...

07:40.828 --> 07:42.596
Whoa, cake's for closers,
Sully, okay?

07:42.630 --> 07:44.297
You razzle-dazzle them
and then we'll talk.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.601
Looks like my little crap fest
is right up Ben's alley.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.603
Hope you guys didn't spend

07:49.637 --> 07:51.138
too much money
on the rides,

07:51.171 --> 07:54.775
and the games,
and all the whatnots.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.810
Who's the clown now?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.946
Of course, Ben would choose
a demented clown

07:58.979 --> 08:00.180
over this amazing party.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.715
Why wouldn't he?

08:01.749 --> 08:03.316
He'll be back.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.318
I got a different horse
in this race,

08:05.352 --> 08:07.521
or shall I say pony?

08:07.555 --> 08:10.357
I'm guessing you got
him a My Mini Pony?

08:10.390 --> 08:13.160
No, because that'd be
the lamest thing ever.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.795
I got him a real pony.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.830
Which saying out loud
also sounds pretty lame.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.365
You know what?

08:18.398 --> 08:21.168
Just, uh, tell everybody
to meet out on the front lawn

08:21.201 --> 08:22.469
in ten minutes.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.804
No, screw that,
let's drop that thing

08:23.837 --> 08:25.539
right through the front door
and up the gut

08:25.573 --> 08:27.040
of her stupid-ass party.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.511
All right,
what do we call this...

08:31.545 --> 08:33.313
girl?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.315
She got a name?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.717
Uh, "Ice Cream."

08:36.750 --> 08:37.985
(pony snorts)

08:38.018 --> 08:39.553
What do I feed her?

08:39.587 --> 08:41.689
Ah, you know, standard stuff:
carrots, hay.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.056
Definitely not chocolate,
though.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.758
Chocolate, isn't
that a dog thing?

08:44.792 --> 08:47.260
Nah, horses, dogs,
same thing.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.697
Are they?
Hey, they're both
animals, right?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.199
Help me up
on this thing.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.366
All right,
here you go.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.168
I'll boost you. Oh, hey.
(grunts)

08:55.202 --> 08:57.370
Oh, oh, easy now. Oh.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.106
Where are the brakes on this?
I don't know.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.541
I'm just the delivery guy.
What? No, where you going?

09:01.575 --> 09:02.776
Don't leave!

09:02.810 --> 09:04.511
Where are you going?

09:04.544 --> 09:05.879
Stop. Where you going?
Where you going?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.414
Stop! No!

09:07.447 --> 09:08.882
Sabrina!

09:08.916 --> 09:09.917
Sabrina, help!

09:11.418 --> 09:12.853
'Sup.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.921
Oh...

09:13.954 --> 09:16.389
Stop. Oh, God...

09:16.423 --> 09:17.691
Help!

09:17.725 --> 09:20.594
Okay, Sully, this is it,
let's do it.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.562
You got it.
Just, uh, give me ten minutes

09:22.596 --> 09:23.964
and we'll
light this place up.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.532
Mm-mm, yeah,
Light it up.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.900
but did you not
just hear me?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.401
I said this is it,
it's showtime.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.903
Oh, I heard you,
but I got to bang out

09:29.937 --> 09:32.072
my pre-show ritual first.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.540
Where's your green room?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.709
Oh, no, man, this is a home,

09:35.743 --> 09:37.077
so we-we don't have
a green room,

09:37.110 --> 09:39.112
but you should do
whatever you need to do.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.814
Well, what other
kind of rooms do you have?

09:40.848 --> 09:42.582
For you?
The bathroom.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.317
You be back in two minutes
or so help me God

09:44.351 --> 09:45.986
I will take the cake
off the table.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.821
Well, you don't have
to be a bitch about it.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.256
Oh, hey, come on, man.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.458
Where's Sully going?

09:51.491 --> 09:53.593
Eh... he-he just
needed to stretch,

09:53.627 --> 09:54.828
but he'll be right back.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.563
(kids sigh, groan)

09:56.596 --> 09:58.165
Yeah, maybe he will.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.267
Or maybe we'll never
see him again.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.569
Who here likes surprises?
Oh.
No.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.905
(kids yelling over each other)
That's what I thought. Okay.

10:04.938 --> 10:05.939
You guys sit tight,
I'm gonna run

10:05.973 --> 10:07.140
and get the best surprise

10:07.174 --> 10:09.342
in the history of birthdays.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.411
(kids cheer)
Yay!

10:11.444 --> 10:12.813
Yes.
Hey, what are you doing?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.081
I got a thing going here.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.448
You do? Hmm.
Yeah.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.851
I don't see anything.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.988
Yeah, but-- Mm. Ugh.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.456
Chip, we're ready
for the pony!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
Chip!

10:31.732 --> 10:33.533
No. Hey! Ah!

10:33.566 --> 10:34.668
All right, all right. Yeah.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.603
(screams)

10:36.636 --> 10:38.806
(phone vibrating)

10:44.577 --> 10:46.113
Chip?
Sabrina!

10:46.146 --> 10:48.581
Oh, I've never been happi--
no, no!

10:50.150 --> 10:51.584
(screams)

10:54.888 --> 10:56.223
Damn it.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.127
Damn it!

11:00.160 --> 11:02.730
This one in the star glasses,
is she eyeballing me?

11:10.270 --> 11:11.705
Oh.
Oh, hey there.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.173
Hey.
We're so excited

11:13.206 --> 11:14.474
about your surprise,
did you bring the surprise?

11:14.507 --> 11:15.475
Is it in your pocket?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.576
Yeah, it's coming.

11:16.609 --> 11:17.577
Mm.
Chip is just

11:17.610 --> 11:18.879
a little tied up
at the moment.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.380
Oh.
So,

11:20.413 --> 11:22.315
let's get on
with the clown show.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.885
Oh, we would love to,
but you eighty-sixed the clown.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.020
Remember when she made us
get rid of that fun clown,

11:27.054 --> 11:28.421
who was gonna do
fun clown stuff?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.422
(murmuring agreement)
I remember. Yeah.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.423
We did that

11:30.457 --> 11:31.491
because we were
waiting for that

11:31.524 --> 11:32.325
big surprise
that you promised.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.827
Are you gonna
break your promise?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.729
No.
Uh-uh.
We don't break promises.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.264
No, I would never break
a promise, okay?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.099
It's just...
it's just gonna take

11:39.132 --> 11:40.367
a little bit longer,
that's all.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.869
MICKEY:
Mm.
(kids groan)

11:41.902 --> 11:43.070
Ms. Mickey?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.271
Mm.
We have a problem.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.039
Not now, Alba, I'm gloating.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.574
Uh, no, this is something
that cannot wait.

11:47.607 --> 11:48.608
So, come on,

11:48.641 --> 11:50.443
let's move fast

11:50.477 --> 11:51.879
to-towards that something

11:51.912 --> 11:54.381
that is in
the other room.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.250
You are not moving fast enough
for this thing

11:57.284 --> 11:58.585
that is something.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.353
We can just go.
MICKEY: All right.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.222
Ay...
Oh, whoa.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.456
Dear God!

12:03.490 --> 12:05.092
Gross!
(Alba speaks Spanish)

12:05.125 --> 12:06.593
Oh...

12:06.626 --> 12:08.796
Oh, clown down.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.701
What the hell happened?
What do you think happened?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.703
Syringe, spoon,
tied-off balloon--

12:16.736 --> 12:17.704
come on, do the math.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.739
Nice one, Mickey!
What did I do?

12:19.773 --> 12:21.775
You brought a junkie
to a kid's birthday party!

12:21.809 --> 12:22.876
No, I didn't. He did.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.144
No, I-- uh,

12:24.177 --> 12:25.712
No! You asked for this guy!

12:25.745 --> 12:27.747
I didn't, I asked for
someone like this guy.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.249
I got you the real guy!
(coughing)
Oh, he's alive!

12:29.282 --> 12:31.084
He's choking!
JIMMY:
Oh, get in there!

12:31.118 --> 12:32.820
What?
Get the airway, get the airway!

12:32.853 --> 12:34.621
Come on.
Okay, hang in there, Sully,
I got to clear this out!

12:34.654 --> 12:35.956
Open your mouth.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.257
I-I fishhooked something.
Get it!

12:37.290 --> 12:38.425
Here we go. What...?
Get it.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.659
Whoa.
What?!

12:39.692 --> 12:40.760
Are you kidding me?

12:40.794 --> 12:43.263
(groaning)
This is crazy!

12:43.296 --> 12:44.597
Oh, man,
Ben would have loved that.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.833
This is so stupid!

12:45.866 --> 12:46.934
(groans)
SABRINA: Get it out!

12:46.967 --> 12:48.268
ALBA: Get him moving
or something.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.436
I'm-- I'm try--
(groans)

12:49.469 --> 12:51.471
Cough it up!
I did it, I got it!

12:51.504 --> 12:53.841
At least he's alive,
sort of.
Wake up!

12:53.874 --> 12:55.408
I know you're in there, man.
Wake up!

12:55.442 --> 12:56.743
JIMMY: Harder!
MICKEY: Stop it!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.611
Wake up!

12:58.645 --> 12:59.980
Don't leave me now,
Sully, come on!

13:00.013 --> 13:01.614
Come on, Sully!
JIMMY: Sully!

13:01.648 --> 13:02.782
Hey, guys, what you doing?

13:02.816 --> 13:05.018
MICKEY: Huh?
ALL: No!

13:05.052 --> 13:07.287
(all yelling)
Oh! Oh, no!

13:07.320 --> 13:09.089
He swallowed it.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.657
It's all the way
down. It's gone.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.459
That's okay,
that's okay.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.527
It's okay, it's good,
we're fine.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.762
Uh, Alba?
Hmm?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.097
Why don't you take
our little birthday boy

13:17.130 --> 13:18.665
back outside...

13:18.698 --> 13:20.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
...so I can come up
with a plan.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.668
Okay, okay,
come on, come on.
'Cause I will fix this.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.736
Come on.
I will fix it, I can.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.975
Uh...
That's not good!

13:28.008 --> 13:29.342
That balloon!
That's a bad balloon!

13:29.376 --> 13:30.510
I'm gonna call 911!

13:30.543 --> 13:31.511
Yes!
Yes!

13:31.544 --> 13:32.312
No, stop, stop!

13:32.345 --> 13:33.480
Stop! Why?

13:33.513 --> 13:34.381
Because-- listen to me.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.615
Just let me think this through!

13:35.648 --> 13:36.816
What is there to think about?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.685
If we rush Ben
to the emergency room right now,

13:38.718 --> 13:39.786
they are going to
pump his stomach

13:39.819 --> 13:41.354
or they're gonna
dissect him like a frog

13:41.388 --> 13:43.190
and either way,
guess what they're gonna find?

13:43.223 --> 13:45.292
They're gonna find the balloon
and they're not gonna like it!

13:45.325 --> 13:46.526
Okay?
And they're gonna call

13:46.559 --> 13:47.660
Child Protective Services

13:47.694 --> 13:48.996
and he is gonna go
live in a group home,

13:49.029 --> 13:50.497
for this birthday will be ruined
and every birthday

13:50.530 --> 13:52.732
after this one till he's 18
will be ruined.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.567
Yeah, well, at least then
he'll be safe from you!

13:54.601 --> 13:55.735
Okay, you know wha--

13:55.768 --> 13:57.170
I want to--
(yells)

13:58.371 --> 13:59.572
Is that what you want?

13:59.606 --> 14:01.074
Is that really what you want?

14:01.108 --> 14:03.376
You want me to go to jail?

14:08.348 --> 14:09.649
(chuckles)

14:09.682 --> 14:11.484
No! No, I-- no.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.986
Fine. Now let's fix this.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.421
What's the plan?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.923
The plan is very simple.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.024
The plan is get
the bad balloon

14:17.057 --> 14:19.359
out of Ben before it kills him.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.928
Yeah?
Yes, yes.
Yeah.

14:20.961 --> 14:21.661
Move!
Okay!

14:21.694 --> 14:22.862
Yeah. Come on.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.933
Just frickin' kill me already.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.902
Oh, that's a step
in the right direction.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.171
Are we going home now? Ah!

14:31.204 --> 14:32.705
Good pony.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.607
Take-take a left.
Take a left... Yeah!

14:34.641 --> 14:35.842
No! No!

14:35.875 --> 14:37.110
Slow down! Stop!

14:37.144 --> 14:38.745
No!

14:38.778 --> 14:40.580
(exhales)
Coming in hot!

14:40.613 --> 14:42.782
Okay, did you get the ipecac?
No, I did not get the ipecac.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.884
What?
They were all out,
but I got you one better.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.786
Bwah!
What the hell is this?

14:46.819 --> 14:48.255
JIMMY: I have never seen
someone drink that

14:48.288 --> 14:49.422
without throwing up.
What?

14:49.456 --> 14:50.357
I asked you for ipecac

14:50.390 --> 14:51.391
and this is the best you can do?

14:51.424 --> 14:52.892
Yeah, uh, well,
yeah, I--

14:52.926 --> 14:54.561
honestly, that will
make you throw up.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.463
Wait, you want Ben
to get wasted?

14:56.496 --> 14:57.797
No, I don't want
to get him wasted,

14:57.830 --> 14:58.865
but if it happens,
it happens.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.866
This is your guy?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.534
Everyone, relax! I got this.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.370
I'm calling an audible,
I'm going in manually, okay?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.072
Ben, listen close.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.806
What I'm about to
do is gonna suck.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.708
You're gonna hate
it and that's okay.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.978
Sometimes we hate
things, you understand?

15:11.011 --> 15:12.812
Open your mouth.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.214
What are you-- oh.
There we go.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.315
Do you-- do you know
what you're doing?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.084
I'm pulling the trigger!
All right?

15:17.117 --> 15:18.418
You feelin' anything
bubbling up?

15:18.451 --> 15:21.421
No, but it tickles.
Okay.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.922
Seriously?
I'm, like, knee-deep in there.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.124
Oh...

15:24.157 --> 15:25.758
SABRINA:
I'm gonna puke.
Come on.
Come on!

15:25.792 --> 15:27.394
Open wide.
(grunts)

15:27.427 --> 15:29.129
Nothing, huh?
No? Nothing?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.430
This kid's got no gag reflex.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.564
(gags)

15:31.598 --> 15:32.966
JIMMY: What about
a little shimmy?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.968
(squishing)
Yeah.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.506
No?
JIMMY: What
about a swirl?

15:40.607 --> 15:41.941
Faster.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.643
I ca--

15:43.676 --> 15:45.412
I mean, it's like...
I can't watch this.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.247
Yeah, this is starting
to get really uneasy.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.982
No, no, no, no!
Mickey, I'm going to puke,
I'm gonna puke.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.584
All right, everyone just
pull it together! Grow up!

15:51.618 --> 15:52.652
No,

15:52.685 --> 15:53.653
everyone just...

15:53.686 --> 15:54.954
hold it together, it's--
(groans)

15:54.988 --> 15:56.156
(blows raspberry)
...it's all good.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.125
(retches)
Oh!

15:58.158 --> 15:59.126
(Mickey coughing)

15:59.159 --> 15:59.993
(retching continues)

16:04.131 --> 16:08.001
Screw it.
Everyone shut your mouths.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.036
I knew you'd
come around.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.403
This is for me!

16:11.571 --> 16:14.307
Look, what am I doing here?

16:14.341 --> 16:16.776
Just waiting for it
to maybe pass?

16:16.809 --> 16:17.944
Well, guess what?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.946
What if it ruptures
and maybe kills him?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.881
What's Aunt Mickey
talking about?

16:21.914 --> 16:22.649
MICKEY:
Nothing!

16:22.682 --> 16:23.650
I am in charge,

16:23.683 --> 16:25.385
I'm fine, I'm the boss,

16:25.418 --> 16:28.655
and I am deciding that
we're going to the hospital.

16:28.688 --> 16:29.956
Okay,

16:29.989 --> 16:31.691
Ben, listen.

16:31.724 --> 16:32.992
Party's over, okay?

16:33.026 --> 16:34.194
Your Aunt Mickey
screwed up.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.962
I screwed up and, um,

16:35.995 --> 16:37.897
we're gonna have to
take a little ride.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.966
But we haven't even
had cake yet.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.968
JIMMY:
Ah, he's right, Mick.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.504
It's not a party
unless you have cake.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.406
Okay, we'll do cake first.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.540
We'll do cake first.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.542
We'll do cake before the drive

16:49.576 --> 16:50.877
and we'll make
a good memory.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.179
It's the least we can do

16:52.212 --> 16:53.946
before we send him off
into the system.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.885
ALL:
* Happy birthday to you

16:58.918 --> 17:02.389
* Happy birthday to you

17:02.422 --> 17:05.225
(distorted):
* Happy birthday...

17:05.258 --> 17:07.994
Cake!

17:08.027 --> 17:12.865
* ...to you

17:14.467 --> 17:16.703
* Happy birthday dear Ben

17:16.736 --> 17:18.771
SULLY:
Cake!

17:18.805 --> 17:19.939
ALL:
* Happy birthday

17:19.972 --> 17:21.441
Cake!

17:21.474 --> 17:22.675
Sully?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.844
Cake!
(gasps)

17:24.877 --> 17:26.746
What's happening?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.948
(pony neighs, screaming)
Get out of the way!

17:28.981 --> 17:30.950
*

17:30.983 --> 17:32.085
(Chip screams)

17:32.119 --> 17:34.053
*

17:42.061 --> 17:43.563
SABRINA (in slow motion):
Ben!

17:43.596 --> 17:45.832
Look out!

17:50.503 --> 17:53.072
(in slow motion):
Ben!

17:54.441 --> 17:55.408
(grunts)

17:55.442 --> 17:56.209
(guests scream)

17:56.243 --> 17:58.411
CHIP:
Oh!

18:01.114 --> 18:02.582
Oh, thank God it stopped!

18:02.615 --> 18:03.716
(Mickey cackles)

18:03.750 --> 18:05.051
That's why he's my guy!

18:05.084 --> 18:06.486
(coughing)

18:06.519 --> 18:07.454
Oh.
(laughs)

18:07.487 --> 18:10.457
I did it! I saved the day.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.724
Eh.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.792
You got me a pony!

18:12.825 --> 18:13.960
You got me a pony!

18:13.993 --> 18:17.029
This is the best
birthday ever!

18:18.531 --> 18:20.133
(all groaning)

18:20.167 --> 18:20.933
Oh, gross!

18:20.967 --> 18:22.068
That got him to puke?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.337
Oh! (yells)

18:24.371 --> 18:26.005
Oh!
Still intact!

18:26.038 --> 18:27.006
Yes!
Still intact!

18:27.039 --> 18:28.475
We did it!

18:28.508 --> 18:29.676
Oh, yay!

18:29.709 --> 18:30.910
Oh, we did it.
Come here, buddy.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.145
Oh, nice work.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.084
MICKEY:
Hey, Sully!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.619
Get out of here!
Yeah, you're lucky

18:39.652 --> 18:41.188
we don't call the cops
on your junkie ass.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.423
I'm no junkie.
I'm a diabetic.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.091
I live
on birthday cake

18:45.124 --> 18:47.694
and high fructose
corn syrup.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.529
Geez.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.030
What about the needle
and balloons?

18:51.063 --> 18:53.433
Insulin and sugar pills.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.701
The spoon?

18:54.734 --> 18:56.102
Cake.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.771
Try using less
milk chocolate next time.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.974
The frosting is supposed to be
a vehicle for the cake,

19:02.008 --> 19:04.010
not the star of the show.

19:04.043 --> 19:07.079
(groans) Take the cake
and get out of here.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.528
Wow!

19:21.561 --> 19:23.129
Well, that party
was a disaster,

19:23.162 --> 19:24.531
but at least Ben seems
to be having fun.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.832
MICKEY:
Mm-hmm.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.801
Hey, Ben,
I think you missed one.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.702
(Ben gasps)

19:29.736 --> 19:30.637
Who's it from?

19:30.670 --> 19:31.871
I don't know,

19:31.904 --> 19:33.740
we're gonna have to
read the card.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.741
(gasps)

19:34.774 --> 19:36.142
What?!

19:36.175 --> 19:37.977
A postcard from Iraq?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.246
Iraq.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.747
MICKEY:
Who could that be from?

19:40.780 --> 19:43.550
"Dear Ben, greetings from Iraq.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.051
"Mommy and Daddy are sorry

19:45.084 --> 19:48.020
"they couldn't celebrate
your birthday,

19:48.054 --> 19:50.089
but we miss you
and love you very much."

19:50.122 --> 19:51.157
Ah!
(gasps)

19:51.190 --> 19:52.692
"We'll be home

19:52.725 --> 19:54.160
"as soon as we can.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.229
"In the meantime, be a good boy

19:56.263 --> 19:58.197
"and do what
your Aunt Mickey says.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.166
"Don't be fooled
by her good looks,

20:00.199 --> 20:02.769
she's actually smarter
than all of you."

20:02.802 --> 20:03.770
Hmm.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.171
"Love, Mom."

20:05.204 --> 20:06.939
Oh, buddy!

20:06.973 --> 20:08.508
That's so great!
What's in it?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.643
I don't know, you're gonna
have to open it up, goofball.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.783
(gasps)
Syrup!

20:16.816 --> 20:17.884
(hums)

20:17.917 --> 20:19.386
(gasps)
Taquitos!

20:20.487 --> 20:22.255
My Mini Pony dolls!

20:22.289 --> 20:23.155
(smooches)

20:24.257 --> 20:26.058
A mouse!
(mouse squeaking)

20:26.092 --> 20:27.760
Nice touch.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.629
Thanks.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.198
BEN:
This is the greatest
birthday ever!

20:32.231 --> 20:33.766
I know you didn't ask
for any of this.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.234
BEN: I'm gonna have
taquitos with syrup.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.436
And I basically hate

20:36.469 --> 20:37.770
every single thing about you;

20:37.804 --> 20:40.873
the way you look,
the way you sound,

20:40.907 --> 20:41.941
your smell...

20:41.974 --> 20:44.010
Is there a "but" coming?

20:45.278 --> 20:46.313
But...

20:46.346 --> 20:47.314
Whoop, he's eating
the mouse.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.781
No!
Hey!

20:48.815 --> 20:49.749
I get the doctor.
Okay,

20:49.782 --> 20:50.750
come on, kid.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.151
What if we just dance again,
huh?

20:52.184 --> 20:53.720
You know, there's a chance

20:53.753 --> 20:55.221
it actually crawls through.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.589
Oh, sure!

20:56.623 --> 20:58.491
Let's drop everything
because Ben

20:58.525 --> 21:00.627
swallowed something again.
It's not even his real birthday!

21:00.660 --> 21:02.429
What about me?
I was almost killed today!

21:03.996 --> 21:04.997

Media Access Group at WGBH
