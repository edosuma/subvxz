00:02.669 --> 00:05.024
<i>Not only did I have a long-distance
girlfriend who was pregnant,</i>

00:05.255 --> 00:07.325
<i>but I still hadn't found an apartment.</i>

00:07.549 --> 00:10.222
<i>So, I was living
on my half-acre in a tent.</i>

00:11.511 --> 00:13.149
<i>A haunted tent.</i>

00:19.811 --> 00:22.609
- Stop stealing our power.
- You are ruining our neighbourhood!

00:22.856 --> 00:23.811
Oh, really, Donna?

00:23.982 --> 00:26.780
I'm ruining the neighbourhood.
At least I'm quiet.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.303
Were you guys having sex last night
or raping a baboon?

00:31.448 --> 00:34.167
- I wasn't home last night.
- My bad.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.703
I am gonna beat your ass.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.346
Check out that body.
Bet you'd like to give her a ride, huh?

00:48.340 --> 00:50.695
- You betcha.
- Over here, perv.

00:51.718 --> 00:55.757
It's for my retirement, so Enid and I
can see the country in luxury.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.341
So it's wheelchair accessible
for her, sir?

01:01.019 --> 01:03.977
Ted, I'm not retiring
for at least three years.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.619
If she's still alive, I'll deal with it then.

01:06.858 --> 01:10.487
Now, take the rest of the day off
and get her washed and waxed.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.778
You smell like my mom.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.679
All right, Mr Mariani.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.987
<i>Mazel tov, you are the proud owner
of yet another kidney stone!</i>

01:25.669 --> 01:27.341
Did you try laying off
the red meat, buddy?

01:27.545 --> 01:30.013
I'm trying, Doc, but it's hard.

01:30.256 --> 01:33.089
Oh, man, Kim's having
her first ultrasound tomorrow.

01:33.343 --> 01:37.018
Wow, there's nothing like that
first ultrasound. Bring tissue.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.784
Are you kidding me?
I can't just up and leave.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.248
I gotta find an apartment.
I live in a teepee.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.706
<i>Dorian</i>

01:44.229 --> 01:47.301
You have been wrong
about so many things

01:47.565 --> 01:50.955
that I'm not even going to say
something's "wrong" any more.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.194
Instead, I'm going to say, "It's Dorian. "

01:54.614 --> 01:56.093
And the fact that
you'd be willing to skip seeing

01:56.282 --> 01:59.991
that child's heartbeat
for the first time is just plain Dorian.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.800
I mean, hell, Jordan's having
her second ultrasound,

02:03.039 --> 02:04.358
and I couldn't be more giddy.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.055
I can't wait to find out the sex
of that unborn tax break.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.887
Jordan doesn't let you know the sex
until the baby's born.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.609
Dorian again.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.390
I don't know if it's the hormones

02:13.591 --> 02:15.661
or if the baby is actually
eating the bitch cells,

02:15.885 --> 02:18.240
but Jordan has softened.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.063
In fact, last night she...

02:21.891 --> 02:23.483
She asked me to cuddle.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.357
<i>Is cuddling bad now?</i>

02:26.855 --> 02:29.813
Baby, I need permission to road trip
J. D. to Tacoma

02:30.066 --> 02:31.704
so he can see his ultrasound.

02:31.901 --> 02:32.890
Sure.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.185
I think not giving you permission
to do this for your friend

02:35.405 --> 02:37.361
would be totally Dorian.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.565
<i>How is this spreading so quickly?</i>

02:39.784 --> 02:40.899
Gandhi?

02:41.619 --> 02:45.612
Did you tell Jordan what I said
about her wanting to cuddle?

02:45.915 --> 02:49.464
She doesn't like people to know
that she actually cares for me.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.825
Relax. She's pregnant.
What could she possibly do?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.806 --> 03:04.684
Good boy, Jack. Good boy.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.873
He can't possibly
make this my fault, right?

03:08.104 --> 03:10.902
Dorian. Damn it, now I'm doing it.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.053
Be careful, he's going foetal.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.648
<i>The secret to a great road trip</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:32.029
<i>is to get as many people as possible
to come along.</i>

03:32.253 --> 03:34.403
- So, are you guys in?
- Totally!

03:34.798 --> 03:35.787
The last road trip I went on

03:35.965 --> 03:37.637
was when my sorority sisters and I
went to Tijuana.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.231
So it will be nice to go with people
who actually like me.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.062
Why are you always so hard
on yourself?

03:42.263 --> 03:44.174
Your sorority sisters
probably loved you.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.461
Keith, they tried to sell me.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.805
You know, Keith, if the buyer
hadn't been an undercover Federale,

03:50.063 --> 03:52.293
Elliot would be a slave somewhere,

03:52.524 --> 03:55.277
there wouldn't be any uncomfortable
sexual tension between us,

03:55.527 --> 03:58.121
and you and I
would probably be best friends.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.001
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.313
Keith!

04:05.745 --> 04:08.020
Oh, well, we still can't make it.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.743
We made plans to finally
hang out with my grandma.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.233
Oh, Keith, the woman is 96 years old.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.455
There will be plenty
of weekends for that. Road trip!

04:14.671 --> 04:16.184
- This way.
- Okay.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.890
You know,
you are one special lady, Carla.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.332
It's not every wife that works a full shift,

04:24.556 --> 04:26.626
then goes home
to change the baby's diapers

04:26.850 --> 04:30.559
while her husband and his girlfriend
spend the weekend mooning truckers

04:30.854 --> 04:32.685
and playing Slug Bug.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.969
- It's not a big deal.
- Oh, but it is.

04:36.234 --> 04:40.750
If you keep letting Gandhi do whatever
he pleases whenever he pleases,

04:41.072 --> 04:42.551
while you take care of the baby,

04:42.741 --> 04:45.858
eventually you're not
even gonna have time

04:46.119 --> 04:47.916
to shave your legs or groom your face,

04:48.121 --> 04:52.273
thus making the most prominent
male figure in your daughter's life, you.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.026
<i>Adios, pickle!</i>

04:56.504 --> 04:59.940
As soon as I change out of
these clothes, I'm out of here!

05:01.634 --> 05:03.545
I'm going. You're staying.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.197
How'd you do that?

05:08.391 --> 05:12.179
Gandhi, I'm great at this stuff.
Don't ever talk to Jordan again.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.129
Road trip!

05:15.857 --> 05:18.610
- Where's Chocolate Bear?
- Getting to know his daughter.

05:18.860 --> 05:22.489
<i>I knew that little tan baby
would eventually ruin everything.</i>

05:22.781 --> 05:25.932
- Keith, take the front seat, sweetie.
- I can't.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.704
Rowdy needs to see the world.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.790
We need a bigger ride.

05:34.793 --> 05:38.832
<i>Do you guys know
where I could find a giant carwash?</i>

05:42.217 --> 05:43.491
All right!

05:44.886 --> 05:46.365
I got friends!

05:51.726 --> 05:54.115
- Hey, cutie.
- Hey.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.822
Oh, like there's a chance I meant you.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.293
So, you're here
for your ultrasound, huh?

05:58.483 --> 05:59.916
I can't believe you're gonna let him
know the sex,

06:00.110 --> 06:02.101
especially when you could...

06:02.570 --> 06:07.849
- No, that's too mean. I couldn't do it.
- No, mean's good. It's... I like mean.

06:08.743 --> 06:12.975
You could learn the sex,
not tell Perry, hold it over his head

06:13.289 --> 06:15.598
and play him like your little bitch-boy.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.109
Perry was so wrong about you.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.828
You're not an idiotic, scalpel-toting,

06:21.047 --> 06:24.437
basketball-dribbling,
blood-sugar-watching, idiotic man-boy.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.753
Stop.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.724
This thing is awesome!

06:31.391 --> 06:33.507
What's with all these kimonos?

06:33.977 --> 06:36.935
I don't know,
but there is a stripper pole in the back.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.940
Carla's got some serious moves.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.141
She can even do
an inverted spread-leg pole spin.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.718
You know, if that's what they're called.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.338
It's not like I took
a pole-dancing class or anything.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.927
<i>Nice cover.</i>

06:49.659 --> 06:54.130
Don't touch the kimonos. Those are
for Dr Kelso's various masseuses.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.845
- Ted, who's driving?
- Oh, my bad!

06:58.835 --> 07:02.305
Maybe I should drive,
so we don't all die! No offence, Ted.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.439
None taken.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.204
I wish none of us had to drive.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.330
<i>We are cruising
at a comfortable speed, Dr Dorian,</i>

07:12.557 --> 07:14.354
<i>and should arrive ahead of schedule.</i>

07:14.559 --> 07:16.515
<i>Could you possibly
do me a small favour?</i>

07:16.728 --> 07:18.798
Of course, Jonathan 3000.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.331
<i>Could you rub that spot off
my dashboard?</i>

07:21.566 --> 07:23.079
You got it, pal.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.506
<i>- Oh, yeah. Just like that.
- All right.</i>

07:25.737 --> 07:27.773
<i>That's the stuff, you bitch.</i>

07:29.741 --> 07:32.813
It can get lonely on the road,
even for computers,

07:33.578 --> 07:35.853
but this is gonna be great, right?

07:36.081 --> 07:39.915
I miss my baby. We have to go back.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.153
And now,
if we slide the wand over here,

07:44.381 --> 07:46.656
we'll see if it's a boy or a girl.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.220
Wait. Change of plans, Per. Beat it.

07:50.970 --> 07:51.925
No, no, no.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.292
You committed to finding out
the sex of the child this time.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.553
Oh, yeah, I am gonna find out the sex,
but you're not,

07:57.811 --> 08:01.929
unless you work out a routine with Jack
for the parent-child dance recital.

08:02.232 --> 08:06.020
Jordan, the boy already lip-synchs
into your tampons.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.550
Must we put the final nail
in his tiny gay coffin?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.643
Mama wants that trophy.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.186
Tell her she can't do this.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.918
I would, but when she looks at me,
my insides get all cold.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.765
You're a coward. You're a coward.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.759
Did Jordan change her mind
for some strange unexpected reason?

08:31.886 --> 08:33.239
Here, I... Here, see if I can't...

08:33.429 --> 08:35.580
Oh, thanks, man.
That would be awesome.

08:35.974 --> 08:39.171
Beardface!
Take your foot and go 90-ish.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.874
Yeah, attaboy!

08:48.653 --> 08:49.642
Yeah!

08:50.321 --> 08:53.154
That was awesome, but un-cool.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.470
He's not answering!
Something's wrong with the baby!

08:58.705 --> 09:00.582
- I'm telling Elliot to turn around.
- No, no, no.

09:00.790 --> 09:05.341
Carla, darling, everything's fine with
the baby, fine with... Hey, what's that?

09:08.089 --> 09:10.364
Now, I'll let you out
when you calm down!

09:10.592 --> 09:11.581
Open this door, J.D. Let me out!

09:11.760 --> 09:15.116
And then I realised that my dad
had hugged me at my graduation.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.585
Not with his arms,
you know, but with his brain.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.238
Keith! Come and keep me company.
I'm lonely!

09:24.481 --> 09:26.392
Hey, you know who else is lonely?
My grandma.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.405
No, she's not, Keith.

09:28.610 --> 09:32.285
She's a lesbian in a nursing home
full of old ladies. You do the math.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.766
We could solve both our problems

09:33.948 --> 09:36.587
if we could get my grandmother
together with your mom.

09:36.826 --> 09:41.456
Excuse me, my mother
sleeps with men. I've seen it!

09:42.207 --> 09:46.519
- All right, calm down, mama's boy.
- Bring it on, tall and sexy!

09:46.836 --> 09:47.871
Kick his ass, Ted!

09:48.046 --> 09:52.039
That's enough! If you guys can't get
along, then just sit down and don't talk!

09:52.342 --> 09:53.775
Amen to that.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.980
- What are you doing here?
- I'll tell you what I wasn't doing here.

09:58.223 --> 10:01.579
I was not taking a nap on company time
in Dr Kelso's mobile home.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.204
Not this guy.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.954
Back to work!

10:12.946 --> 10:16.143
- I don't think he knew we were moving.
- Elliot, stop!

10:23.957 --> 10:27.632
So, can I stop squeezing out brats
or is it another stupid boy?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.197
Uh-oh.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.886
Excuse me for a second.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.758
"Uh-oh"? Don't say, "Uh-oh. "

10:37.220 --> 10:38.858
...road trip right now.
- There's a little difference

10:39.055 --> 10:40.044
between a road trip and a sonogram.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.497
I'm supposed to be
on a road trip right now!

10:41.683 --> 10:43.753
Follow him! He said, "Uh-oh. "

10:48.940 --> 10:50.658
Okay, let's get you up.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.531
Where'd everyone go?

10:52.944 --> 10:54.616
He's fine. Let's get going.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.051
Look at us! I hurt my ankle.

10:57.282 --> 11:00.479
Ted might have a broken arm
and the Janitor is blind!

11:00.744 --> 11:04.134
Hey, wait. No. Coming back. Hello!

11:05.373 --> 11:06.567
Who's making pancakes?

11:06.750 --> 11:09.344
See? He's great and so's Ted.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.360
Oh, I think he popped it back into joint.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.747
You guys, Turk told me how amazing
it was when he saw Izzy's ultrasound.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.443
I can't miss this. I just... I won't.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.184
Can I say something?

11:26.603 --> 11:29.242
I don't know this young man.
I wish I did.

11:29.856 --> 11:34.293
I admire his spirit, and if he says
we must continue onward,

11:34.611 --> 11:36.886
then I say I am in!

11:41.409 --> 11:44.207
<i>There are a lot of times in life
when you just have to take control.</i>

11:44.454 --> 11:46.968
Wait, give me those keys! I'm driving.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.750
Next stop, Kim-town.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.810
<i>Of course, sometimes
control is taken away from you.</i>

11:57.008 --> 11:59.806
You have to operate on my baby
while it's still in the womb?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.406
Well, there's a urinary tract obstruction

12:01.596 --> 12:03.632
which could be blocking
the amniotic fluid.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.839
We need to place a shunt.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.856
I gotta talk to Jordan.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.170
Mickhead, give me my phone!

12:14.401 --> 12:15.880
- It's mine.
- Oh, really?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.139
Does yours have a picture of Carla
in the background?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.035
- Yes.
- Trick question.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.310
Mine's got Tyra Banks, see?

12:24.703 --> 12:26.182
- Shello!
- Baby?

12:27.497 --> 12:28.896
I got Turk!

12:29.624 --> 12:33.014
<i>And sometimes you're just not
as in control as you think you are.</i>

12:34.462 --> 12:36.817
That tunnel looks kind of small.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.690
Chill out, Ted.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.774
<i>Why would they build a tunnel
that an RV wouldn't fit through?</i>

12:46.975 --> 12:49.170
<i>Admittedly, the tunnel was
more narrow than I thought,</i>

12:49.394 --> 12:51.464
<i>but the damage wasn't too bad.</i>

12:53.565 --> 12:54.884
<i>Keith just had to stop accidentally</i>

12:55.066 --> 12:58.615
<i>making the "please honk your horn"
sign to passing truckers.</i>

13:00.447 --> 13:03.166
- Holy frick on a stick!
- I was stretching!

13:04.576 --> 13:06.214
Four aces, I win!

13:08.538 --> 13:11.098
Now you only got a six of clubs. I win.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.103
Okay, baby, bye.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.300
There's a problem
with Jordan's ultrasound.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.265
This is our best chance
to restore normal function

13:20.467 --> 13:22.298
and minimise the damage to the lungs.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.579
Fine, but I want to be in there.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.799
You know we can't allow
family members in the OR.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.772
You gotta be in there for me.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.535
Don't you see I got a baby
strapped to my chest?

13:32.729 --> 13:33.957
All right.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.757
Now can you?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.534
First of all, I'm not a neonatal surgeon.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.294
Second, you ruined my road trip,

13:41.488 --> 13:44.241
and you just gave my baby to Rochelle,
the only nurse to get kicked out of

13:44.491 --> 13:47.403
the nursery for using a baby
as a ventriloquist dummy.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.617
I don't like being spanked.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.625
That's because you haven't
found someone who's doing it right!

13:54.501 --> 13:55.900
Give me that!

13:57.921 --> 13:59.912
What's the matter with you?

14:00.882 --> 14:03.442
Gandhi, you'd damn sure
want somebody in there

14:03.677 --> 14:05.315
if it was your kid.

14:08.556 --> 14:12.231
- Come on, just do it.
- Knock it off, Rochelle!

14:14.646 --> 14:17.080
You guys, there's her hospital.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.704
Keith, wake up, sweetie. We're here.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.645
Yes!

14:24.322 --> 14:26.040
I didn't see a truck!

14:28.368 --> 14:29.562
Well, how are you gonna get home?

14:29.744 --> 14:31.223
I don't know,
I'll rent a car or something.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.290
Go take care of Dr Cox.

14:33.498 --> 14:37.411
Tell him Gladys is thinking of him.
He'll know it's me.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.443
Good luck.

14:41.589 --> 14:45.901
Farewell, stranger.
I shall toast you with my heartiest wine.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.389
Maybe he should lie down.

14:58.857 --> 15:02.566
Turkleton, if I let you assist
on that surgery,

15:02.861 --> 15:06.012
I would be breaking
every hospital protocol.

15:06.281 --> 15:09.796
And you know damn well
I would never be that inappropriate.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.074
Oh, thanks, sugar-boobs.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.005
Lucky for you, I am a man in need.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.972
Enid asked me to get her tickets
to see Al Green for her birthday.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.847
I forgot, now it's sold out.
Can you call him for me?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.814
Sir, do you think I know Al Green
just because I'm black?

15:32.015 --> 15:37.009
Plan B. Also, lucky for you,
Enid has gone blind from glaucoma.

15:37.354 --> 15:40.664
Now, here's what I need.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.738
<i>In life, it's never easy
to know what's waiting for you</i>

15:43.985 --> 15:46.135
<i>on the other side of that door.</i>

15:49.491 --> 15:50.844
Surprise.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.990
Oh, my God, J. D!

15:56.790 --> 15:58.860
- Come here for a second, come here.
- What...

15:59.084 --> 16:00.881
Come here so we can see your office.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.651
- Everything is gonna be okay.
- I know.

16:08.885 --> 16:12.036
Jordan, I love you.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.617
<i>Sometimes you find a moment
that knocks you on your ass.</i>

16:17.852 --> 16:19.808
How's our baby doing, huh?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.524
J.D., I had a miscarriage.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.038
<i>Other times,
it just takes your breath away.</i>

16:32.075 --> 16:33.064
Whoa!

16:35.078 --> 16:37.228
Hey. So, everything went great.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.178
Yeah, Jordan and the baby are fine.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.645
Fair enough.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.213
- That... That's it?
- Yep.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.636
Okay, I don't know about you,
but when I get great news,

16:47.841 --> 16:50.116
I like to show some form of emotion.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.733
Like when I graduated med school,
I went all Billy "White Shoes" Johnson.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.572
I'm all, like...

16:56.808 --> 16:59.880
And then when Izzy was born,
Tiger Woods arm swing.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.878
Look, you know as well as I do

17:07.109 --> 17:09.419
that no kid who has surgery
before it's even born

17:09.654 --> 17:12.885
is just gonna pop out into the world
without any...

17:14.034 --> 17:15.911
Without any problems.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.977
In three months,
it's gonna outgrow that shunt,

17:18.163 --> 17:20.438
and we're gonna have to go through
this whole thing all over again.

17:20.665 --> 17:24.180
So you're gonna have to excuse me
if I'm not celebrating.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.978
Your baby's gonna be fine.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.288
And just how could you be
so sure of that?

17:29.507 --> 17:33.819
Because that little thing grabbed
my finger so tight and wouldn't let go.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.519
Perry, she's strong.

17:42.187 --> 17:45.114
- She?
- Yeah, Daddy.

17:46.649 --> 17:51.564
I should have told you earlier. I just...
I didn't want to do it on the phone and...

17:51.905 --> 17:53.054
You okay?

17:54.449 --> 17:57.361
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's... It's just... It's kind of weird.

17:57.619 --> 18:01.214
There was this thing that I never met.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.471
And now it's gone. I kind of miss it.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.779
I know.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.496
And I was already
kind of looking forward

18:10.715 --> 18:12.990
to doing all of those parent things
you hear about.

18:13.218 --> 18:17.848
You know, like changing diapers,
first steps, playing catch.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.938
Turk was gonna even teach me
how to throw like a guy, so...

18:22.185 --> 18:25.780
Unless it was a girl,
then you could just throw like yourself.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.854
Can I ask you something?

18:29.818 --> 18:32.969
Were we just staying together
'cause we were having a kid?

18:33.238 --> 18:35.832
No. No, come on.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.890
Come back from this
in a couple of months,

18:38.076 --> 18:40.112
we're gonna pick up
right where we left off.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.286
I mean,
I guess it'll be a little more casual.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.655
We probably shouldn't talk, though,

18:44.833 --> 18:47.301
unless we're wearing
full body condoms.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.713
What if I wasn't coming back

18:49.921 --> 18:52.993
because they offered me
a permanent position here?

18:54.509 --> 18:55.737
Did they?

18:57.095 --> 18:58.210
Yeah.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.317
<i>We sat there all night
and talked about everything.</i>

19:07.564 --> 19:09.043
<i>How we felt about each other.</i>

19:09.232 --> 19:11.541
<i>Whether we could handle
a long-distance relationship.</i>

19:11.776 --> 19:14.210
<i>Did she ever see herself
coming back to Sacred Heart?</i>

19:14.446 --> 19:17.643
<i>Would a pizza place deliver
to a bench at 3:00 in the morning?</i>

19:17.907 --> 19:19.181
<i>They would.</i>

19:19.743 --> 19:20.971
<i>And at the end of it all,</i>

19:21.161 --> 19:23.629
<i>we both realised that
without a baby in the picture,</i>

19:23.872 --> 19:26.864
<i>the best thing to do was
to say goodbye, stay friends,</i>

19:27.125 --> 19:30.356
<i>and just hope that our paths
cross again, someday.</i>

19:33.840 --> 19:38.197
<i>So then I took a $900 cab ride home
and, voila, here I am.</i>

19:38.803 --> 19:41.192
J.D., that sucks. I'm so sorry.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.723
Bummer.
Now, why am I back in here again?

19:44.976 --> 19:48.525
Because I couldn't wait to rub
a little jelly on your treasure trail.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.203
No, I have to see
if your kidney stone has dissolved yet.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.241
J.D.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.216
- I always do that.
- Do mine.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.966
<i>There are really only
two kinds of surprises.</i>

20:01.201 --> 20:03.954
<i>The good ones
that make everything okay.</i>

20:05.246 --> 20:06.599
It's a girl.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.827
We're having a baby girl.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.728
<i>And the bad ones that make you mad.</i>

20:13.963 --> 20:17.399
There's Papa's pleasure palace!
Looks great, Teddy!

20:18.885 --> 20:20.682
I'm going on vacation.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.505
Theodore!

20:34.025 --> 20:36.300
All right, let's take a look.

20:37.946 --> 20:41.495
<i>And I could never be mad at Kim
for giving me a bad surprise.</i>

20:41.783 --> 20:45.935
Everything looks healthy.
See, there's your baby's heartbeat.

20:48.331 --> 20:49.446
Wow.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.502
<i>Because at least
she was straight with me.</i>
