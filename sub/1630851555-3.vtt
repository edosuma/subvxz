00:06.006 --> 00:08.758
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.135 --> 00:14.180
Catalina needs to understand
that you two can't be together.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.933
Simón. Are you listening to me?

00:22.063 --> 00:24.274
-Hello.
-Hi, Susi.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.608
Hi.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.819
See you tomorrow at 2:00, okay?

00:27.902 --> 00:30.405
No, I don't think I should.

00:30.488 --> 00:33.783
I think I'm coming down with a cold.

00:34.993 --> 00:35.869
Listen.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.457
I don't think we ever say this, but…

00:41.166 --> 00:44.419
-I love you very much.
-You're so sweet, sis, thanks.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.421
-Sure.
-Are you okay?

00:47.005 --> 00:50.008
Yes, I'm just feeling
a little sentimental today.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.719
-Call me if you need anything.
-Okay.

00:52.802 --> 00:53.803
Take care.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.514
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:04.689 --> 01:07.108
Do you think he knows we exist?

01:07.859 --> 01:11.863
At least one of five pregnant women
had to tell him something.

01:11.946 --> 01:16.659
-Not my mom, she wanted an abortion.
-And yours hid in a convent.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.079
And everyone hid it from us.

01:19.704 --> 01:23.124
Either he threatened them,
or the poor devil never knew.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.127
In any case, he's in for a big surprise.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.422
First we need to find out who he is.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.259
Where the hell is Manny?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.097
Juana Manuela?

01:38.723 --> 01:39.557
Manny.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.852
Everybody calls me Manny.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.814
Manny. Sorry.
You look so much like my mom.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.565
Really?

01:47.649 --> 01:51.027
Yes, why haven't I met my cousin
in 25 years?

01:51.611 --> 01:56.407
-Because my mom loves your mom.
-Yes. Sure.

01:57.158 --> 02:01.955
That's why I contacted you.
My mom will be in Mexico for a few days.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.874
We don't get along too well.

02:05.416 --> 02:09.671
But she's done a lot for me,
so I want to do something for her.

02:10.755 --> 02:11.923
How can I help?

02:15.885 --> 02:21.141
Focus your intention on the quartz crystal
and place it next to your right tit.

02:21.933 --> 02:22.767
Caridad.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.563
Let nobody else touch it.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.778
Valentina.

02:39.868 --> 02:40.702
Yes?

02:40.785 --> 02:44.664
Meet Gregorio Robles.
This is Valentina de la Paz.

02:44.747 --> 02:49.419
Several colleges are using your article
about missing women of last year.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.504
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.008
He was a Conaculta grant holder
when they switched names.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.969
He can access the files you need.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.722
-Really?
-All of them.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.683
Welcome to the magazine.

03:05.101 --> 03:05.935
Excuse me.

03:11.733 --> 03:15.236
Here you are. Missing without a trace.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.990
I'll need another errand soon.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.869
A woman, single, 32.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.913
The full package?

03:27.040 --> 03:31.794
Fliers take about two weeks
from the time I get the information.

03:31.878 --> 03:32.712
Thanks.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.639
Miss Mai.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.432
Miss Mai.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.738
Bautista.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.281
Bautista.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.033
Bautista.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.792
I can't control it anymore.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.545
I'm scaring off my clients.

04:15.046 --> 04:20.093
How do you know it's a memory
and not a vision of another car crash?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.137
It's a different feeling.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.014
I was there.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.643
I have to find out what happened.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.650
I didn't know
novices needed calling cards.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.863
I saw you entering Julia's store.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.034
No, these are…

04:45.868 --> 04:49.080
fliers for an event at the convent.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.291
Are you sure you're okay?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.544
Yes, thanks. Don't worry.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.131
That's what sisters are for.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.552
And to tell each other their secrets.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.766
Count on me whenever you need me, Caridad.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.145
Don't forget.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.490
Yes. That's the old bar.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.869
The new owner even changed the name
two years ago.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.706
So your mom sang here?

06:14.248 --> 06:18.753
I guess so.
Mom always said she'd make it in Mexico.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.424
You should sign up for Thursday.
There's one spot left.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.717
Do they pay anything?

06:25.218 --> 06:29.597
No, but talent-scouting agents
come looking for new faces,

06:29.680 --> 06:31.140
and if you're lucky…

06:31.724 --> 06:32.558
Okay.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.318
-Thanks.
-Good luck.

06:50.284 --> 06:54.247
-Hi, Bea.
-Hi, Daniel. Thursday's booked solid.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.166
Let me see. Lend me your pen.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.130
Matilde Heredia.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.425
She says she's the daughter
of a Colombian singer

07:05.508 --> 07:08.428
whose name is Dominga, same last name.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.304
See you.

07:16.269 --> 07:21.065
Many former Conaculta workers
could be bigwigs now.

07:21.149 --> 07:25.111
The guy you're looking for
could be a deputy,

07:25.987 --> 07:27.196
a mayor.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.241
Even a congressman.

07:30.324 --> 07:33.661
Whatever you're looking for,
you'll open a can of worms.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.525
I shouldn't have reacted like that.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.778
Maybe we can't live together.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.740
But we can see each other.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.452
I won't ask you about my dad.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.080
You say it doesn't matter, then…

08:37.517 --> 08:39.143
Would you like to have a bite?

08:39.227 --> 08:43.105
Not now, but tomorrow
I'd like to take you somewhere.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.608
We can go wherever and whenever you want.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.243
For you.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.957
Buy something.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.754
-I'll pick you up at 6:00
-Fine.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.049
Okay.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.685
Julia makes fake IDs.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.564
Certifications, diplomas.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.402
Whatever a woman in danger needs
to start a new life.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.739
Sometimes they have no choice.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.243
-Does the Mother Superior know?
-No.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.163
That's why I didn't want you guys
to find out.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.749
If someone catches me, I want no…

09:45.626 --> 09:46.586
accomplices.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.548
He has to be a powerful man,

09:51.215 --> 09:54.135
with access to artists
like your mom and Matilde's

09:54.218 --> 09:57.722
who can cancel
an archaeological project like Alice's.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.311
The grant holder was very useful.

10:04.478 --> 10:08.566
Of course I didn't tell him.
He thinks I'm investigating a fraud case.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.444
Come over when you get back.
Have a nice trip.

10:12.153 --> 10:12.987
Bye.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.051
FEDERICO, IT'S VALENTINA.
LET'S HAVE A DRINK.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.053
The documents you wanted.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.147
Thanks.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.955
MOM

11:48.249 --> 11:49.250
What is it, Mom?

11:52.461 --> 11:53.754
Gracie? What's wrong?

11:54.755 --> 11:55.589
What?

11:56.132 --> 11:57.383
Isn't Dad there?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.719
Okay, I'm on my way.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.222
-Bye.
-What's the matter?

12:03.305 --> 12:06.642
My mom took a bunch of pills.
I have to go.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.396
-Call an ambulance.
-No. I'll explain later.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.356
-How can I help?
-Never mind.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.651
-Seriously?
-Yes! What rotten luck!

12:25.244 --> 12:27.413
-Mr. Suárez.
-Manny.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.875
I thought I'd never see you again.

12:31.751 --> 12:36.380
Manny, baby,
you're definitely hotter every day.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.298
Thanks.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.427
But you made me look bad
with my friend Godoy.

12:46.098 --> 12:50.853
It's a good thing he is a generous guy.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.355
A nice guy.

12:54.899 --> 12:55.983
With a big heart.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.278
Stop resisting. My bodyguards are outside.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.617
And he let me…

13:05.993 --> 13:07.411
pay him back today.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.710
No!

13:16.837 --> 13:19.089
And in exchange, he'll forgive you

13:21.091 --> 13:22.843
for the mess you made.

13:25.012 --> 13:25.888
No!

13:31.519 --> 13:32.520
Enjoy it.

13:33.103 --> 13:33.938
Suárez!

13:35.356 --> 13:36.190
Suárez!

13:49.203 --> 13:50.037
Oh no!

13:50.871 --> 13:52.081
No, Grace.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.124
I don't know, Grace.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.420
-Hold on.
-Careful.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.715
I'm so ashamed. Forgive me, Fede.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.133
Do you forgive me?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.051
Mom.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.512
Your dad never loved me.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.765
All he cares about is his job
because he's a bastard.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.725
He's a bastard!

14:11.809 --> 14:14.019
-Mom, don't say that.
-But you're not.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.773
It's just him. You're so cute. Oh, no!

14:17.857 --> 14:20.526
I'm so ashamed! Why did they call you?

14:21.902 --> 14:23.529
Take care, honey.

14:25.781 --> 14:26.866
You're so sweet.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.589
I freaked out when I found her
in the garden, Fede.

14:42.339 --> 14:45.426
It's okay, Grace. I'm glad you called me.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.063
Why are you here?

14:58.147 --> 15:01.066
Grace says Mom put tranquilizers
in her whiskey.

15:02.818 --> 15:06.739
It's nothing new, I don't need the drama
and it's not your problem.

15:11.118 --> 15:15.080
It is if I need to come here
to make sure Mom doesn't overdose!

15:15.581 --> 15:18.417
-Why didn't you take my calls?
-It's called work.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.337
Dad, she needs to go to rehab.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.546
That's ridiculous.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.342
Sure, it would ruin your chance
of becoming a minister

15:26.425 --> 15:28.928
if they find out
your wife is an alcoholic.

15:41.065 --> 15:44.193
Girls, look alive.
We have some great clients.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.945
Your show is after Nina's.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.364
I'm not doing any damn show.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.574
Damn it.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.578
What's wrong, Manny?

15:58.082 --> 16:01.669
Manny, the prosecutor insists
that I switch off the cameras.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.589
-Go away. You're such a moron.
-Forgive me.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.931
You can't just leave.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.309
VALENTINA: WE'RE SISTERS, MANNY
CALL US. YOU'RE NOT ALONE

16:17.393 --> 16:18.894
Is there someone you can call?

16:22.898 --> 16:23.857
Want a drink?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.656
I want to quit this shitty life of mine.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.622
When you do, don't forget me.

16:45.379 --> 16:50.718
YUCATÁN, MEXICO

17:06.108 --> 17:09.194
POLICE DEPARTMENT
YUCATÁN STATE

17:09.278 --> 17:11.780
The coroner said my mom died instantly.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.951
It was a terrible accident
and nothing indicated she had moved.

17:30.799 --> 17:31.633
Caridad.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.513
A police officer is here to see you.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.947
Detective Márquez.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.659
Sister Caridad.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.120
How can I help you?

18:01.872 --> 18:04.416
The lawyer of the guy
we arrested in Cancún

18:04.500 --> 18:07.878
was released by the D.A.
in exchange for cooperating.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.755
I need to speak with Teresa.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.509
We know she's one of Chango's women
and not a nun.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.844
He abducted her.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.931
Teresa phoned me.
I only helped her escape.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.893
We run a shelter for women in danger
here in the convent.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.020
It's not illegal.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.732
Teresa went back to Chihuahua.

18:28.816 --> 18:32.152
Can you contact her?
She could be in grave danger.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.760
That smells yummy, Grandma.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.199
It's okay.

19:20.159 --> 19:24.121
This will happen all your life.
You need to learn to handle it.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.332
Ready?

19:27.416 --> 19:32.880
We'll go to a nice lake with lots of ducks
then pick up a friend who's visiting us.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.590
Wait inside.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.224
Call me when you find her.
I'll take it from there, Sister.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.479
You can call me by my name.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.691
Then call me "Lorenzo."

19:54.484 --> 19:57.321
-Goodbye, Caridad.
-Goodbye, Lorenzo.

20:31.438 --> 20:35.859
I took you home,
but when we returned with the shaman

20:36.777 --> 20:38.904
Nicté was already dead.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.491
No one said I was in the car?

20:43.200 --> 20:46.286
Your grandma thought it was best
to keep it quiet

20:46.370 --> 20:48.247
so you'd forget about it.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.001
-Did you see the accident?
-I heard it at my place.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.423
No one knows what happened.
There's nothing recorded anywhere.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.386
They never found out
who was with you guys.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.723
The guy took off.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.143
I'd recognize him if I saw him.

21:21.196 --> 21:24.116
-Where are you taking me?
-It's a surprise.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.292
Cata!

21:34.084 --> 21:35.377
Susana?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.046
Yes. It's Susana.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.969
Happy birthday, Mom.

21:44.052 --> 21:47.431
It's you! I can't believe it!

21:53.812 --> 21:55.397
Let me look at you.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.734
Hi, Manny, come.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.487
You're gorgeous. I saw your photos.

22:02.571 --> 22:06.950
-Hello, Aunt.
-And you are Federico. You're so cute!

22:07.034 --> 22:09.745
-Thanks, Aunt.
-And you're part of this, right?

22:09.828 --> 22:13.957
I called him.
I had to meet the only family I have.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.668
-Yes. We are your family.
-And your dad?

22:16.752 --> 22:19.546
On a business trip.
It doesn't matter, come.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.510
I'd like you to meet my sister
and my niece.

24:27.090 --> 24:27.924
Matilde.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.680
What do you think, Daniel?

24:33.763 --> 24:35.182
The band is good.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.852
But you're amazing.

24:39.436 --> 24:42.856
Really? Good enough for a full-time job?

24:42.939 --> 24:45.775
-Colombian?
-At your service, sir.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.529
I'll see, paisana.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.626
I've never seen her so happy.

25:04.628 --> 25:08.548
Where do you work?
I know all the bars in town.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.800
I'm a freelancer. And you?

25:10.884 --> 25:12.093
What sounds better?

25:12.177 --> 25:16.181
I'm a free spirit, or I still don't know
what to do with my life?

25:16.264 --> 25:20.227
Both say you're a rich kid
that lives off his folks.

25:26.066 --> 25:29.653
You two need to come to the house
right now.

25:29.736 --> 25:33.031
I told Cata you're working hard.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.574
Whenever you say, Aunt.

25:34.658 --> 25:37.369
-To have dinner tomorrow?
-Great.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.121
Simón won't believe his eyes
when he sees you.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.790
-Right?
-Yes.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.876
Maybe.

25:46.294 --> 25:50.006
-You're mistaken, Pocho.
-You didn't see him gawking at you.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.512
Are you really jealous of a guy
who could be my dad?

26:07.899 --> 26:08.733
Who is it?

26:09.317 --> 26:11.570
Mamá Ela. What's wrong?

26:12.696 --> 26:15.282
What? When did they say that?

26:16.533 --> 26:18.577
No. I still don't know anything.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.747
It's okay. Don't worry, okay?

26:23.623 --> 26:25.792
Yes, tell Papá Antonio it's okay.

26:27.877 --> 26:28.920
Yes. Bye.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.384
What is it?

26:40.849 --> 26:43.268
The cops are issuing an APB on me.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.271
What?

26:47.480 --> 26:48.315
Why?

26:49.691 --> 26:51.067
Answer me! Why?

26:52.193 --> 26:53.028
Because…

26:56.072 --> 26:58.575
Because I killed a man. I'm a murderer.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.496
I can't remember the guy Yumil saw.

27:04.748 --> 27:05.707
That's normal.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.336
You were a kid.
It was a very traumatic event.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.049
Why did he take off and not call anyone?

27:15.050 --> 27:17.802
He could've made an anonymous call
to the cops.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.848
Especially when your mom's life
was in danger.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.396
What if it was intentional?

27:29.147 --> 27:33.902
-I'm sure my mom was driving, Valentina.
-I don't mean the accident, Bautista.

27:41.576 --> 27:44.788
You don't know what it's like
in that part of Colombia.

27:49.084 --> 27:53.254
He always had some drinks
before going to the store.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.967
He was furious
because I refused to date him.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.767
That day he was even drunker than usual.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.187
No!

28:18.863 --> 28:20.323
He was a lieutenant.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.243
We had no one to go to.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.329
That same night…

28:29.958 --> 28:32.127
Grandpa took all his savings

28:33.044 --> 28:34.546
and he gave them to me.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.592
And I fled to Mexico, Pocho.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.038
They're natural feelings.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.040
There's no need to worry.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.586
Mother, I need to take my vows.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.006
I implore you. Please help me.

29:18.506 --> 29:24.345
Child, the convent is no place
to escape or hide from anything.

29:25.889 --> 29:29.100
Maybe you need
to reconsider your decision.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.439
No, I've wanted to be a nun
as far back as I can remember.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.776
The other nuns left everything behind

29:37.859 --> 29:41.112
because they know
what taking their vows means.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.864
You were born here.

29:43.907 --> 29:47.619
There are many ways to devote your life
to serving others.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.830
Not all of them need a habit.

30:04.594 --> 30:08.389
We expect Simón to be included
in the shortlist of three.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.518
The Minister of Justice
is an important position.

30:11.601 --> 30:14.270
Yes, he reports directly to the president.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.606
My husband's dream and his dad's.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.399
When he was a kid,

30:18.483 --> 30:21.736
Rogelia made him use a robe
even on All Soul's Day.

30:22.612 --> 30:27.909
Excuse me, Mrs. Catalina.
Víctor called to say they're on their way.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.287
Thanks, we'll have coffee and dessert
on the terrace.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.455
Yes, ma'am.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.541
Tell me everything,

30:34.624 --> 30:38.419
what you majored in, your job,
if you have a boyfriend.

30:38.503 --> 30:42.674
Some other time, perhaps?
I'm exhausted. I didn't sleep well.

30:42.757 --> 30:47.262
-Come, Susi. The corn cake is delicious.
-Have some black coffee.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.596
Liqueur coffee?

31:01.526 --> 31:03.945
Something told me you came here often.

31:05.780 --> 31:09.659
I came to apologize for rushing out
half naked from your place.

31:09.742 --> 31:13.663
I know what worrying about a mom is like.
No need to apologize.

31:14.163 --> 31:15.206
How is she?

31:15.915 --> 31:16.749
She's fine.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.545
-False alarm.
-Great.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.923
Looking after her is so sweet of you.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.718
Really? Does it make me irresistible?

31:30.054 --> 31:33.641
The truth is,
she's always been very lonely.

31:36.102 --> 31:39.939
But she was just reunited with her sister
after 25 years.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.691
Isn't that incredible?

31:41.774 --> 31:44.527
I hope that helps.

31:48.281 --> 31:51.451
Twenty-five years
to be reunited with a sister.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.120
Wow!

31:56.539 --> 31:58.041
Bartenders are well-paid.

31:58.625 --> 32:02.253
And I can study remotely,
so it works for me.

32:03.212 --> 32:07.008
You are very ambitious.
You must be very proud of her.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.259
I am.

32:09.677 --> 32:10.929
That's excellent.

32:12.096 --> 32:12.931
Susana.

32:14.724 --> 32:15.892
I can't believe it.

32:17.894 --> 32:18.811
Hi, Simón.

32:19.646 --> 32:22.023
Unbelievable. You haven't aged a day.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.486
You must be Manny.

32:27.695 --> 32:30.198
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Same here.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.824
Coffee?

32:32.825 --> 32:34.160
No, thanks.

32:34.243 --> 32:38.539
I need to secure Senator Toledo's vote.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.832
Of course.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.376
Excuse me.

32:44.754 --> 32:49.008
-Simón never changes.
-No, right?

32:59.268 --> 33:02.522
I can't wait to pick up where we left off.

33:07.986 --> 33:08.903
How about 8:30?

33:12.407 --> 33:13.908
I get off at 6:00.

33:17.996 --> 33:22.208
-You haven't answered.
-I think I yelled it in my head.

33:25.044 --> 33:27.088
Switch your phone off first.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.103
-Another drink?
-No.

33:42.186 --> 33:45.314
Come on, two drinks don't hurt anyone.

33:45.398 --> 33:46.315
It's my fourth.

33:46.399 --> 33:49.610
You're such a drama queen, Susana.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.488
-Down the hatch.
-No.

33:52.572 --> 33:55.241
-Where's the bathroom?
-Down the hall.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.706
When are you going to tell me
why you ran away?

34:02.290 --> 34:03.374
Ran away?

34:05.043 --> 34:08.046
I thought I told you I was offered a job?

34:08.129 --> 34:12.383
Yes, in a three-line letter
you mailed me from Monterrey

34:12.467 --> 34:15.845
two weeks after you phoned
to say you had the flu.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.732
You can tell me whatever it is, Susi.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.611
I'm sure it was so long ago
it doesn't matter anymore.

34:32.111 --> 34:34.280
Come on. Tell me.

34:34.947 --> 34:35.823
What happened?

34:37.075 --> 34:38.534
Come on. Tell me.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.624
Forgot something?

34:47.585 --> 34:49.921
The bathroom is the second door
on the right.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.714
Peña Nieto, right?

34:53.299 --> 34:54.133
Yes.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.177
Need something?

35:01.057 --> 35:04.310
I need $200,000 in cash
to get out of here.

35:07.313 --> 35:10.108
That's nothing for a rich guy like you.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.026
I see.

35:13.486 --> 35:18.699
And I have to give it to you
because you're my wife's niece?

35:18.783 --> 35:22.578
No, because you don't want me to talk
and screw up your life.

35:23.996 --> 35:24.831
I see.

35:26.749 --> 35:31.504
I don't know what your game is, Manny.
But you don't know who I am.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.551
I know exactly who you are, Simón.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.054
A total bastard.

35:44.559 --> 35:47.395
What the hell are you doing?
Are you taping me?

35:48.229 --> 35:49.188
Get out of here.

35:56.028 --> 35:57.655
What's that supposed to be?

36:01.784 --> 36:04.537
The honorable Minister of Justice

36:05.037 --> 36:08.332
fucked his sister-in-law
while his wife was pregnant.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.043
Isn't that crazy?

36:13.296 --> 36:14.422
Two hundred grand.

36:18.217 --> 36:20.178
And the secret stays between us…

36:21.804 --> 36:22.638
Dad.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.143
