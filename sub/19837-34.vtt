00:03.080 --> 00:05.010
<b>Heavens Arena.</b>

00:05.010 --> 00:11.280
<b>The 251-story, 991-meter building</b>

00:11.590 --> 00:13.530
<b>is a mecca for fighters.</b>

00:14.170 --> 00:17.420
<b>When combatants win a fight,
they may advance by one class,</b>

00:17.420 --> 00:20.460
<b>and receive a corresponding reward.</b>

00:20.460 --> 00:22.030
<b>After reaching the 100th floor,</b>

00:22.030 --> 00:24.170
<b>you are assigned a private room.</b>

00:24.790 --> 00:26.610
<b>After reaching the 200th floor,</b>

00:26.610 --> 00:32.690
<b>you receive the right to challenge 
the strongest fighters,</b>

00:32.690 --> 00:37.010
<b>the Floor Masters, in an 
intense battle of survival.</b>

00:37.630 --> 00:40.880
<b>This is the best stage</b>

00:40.880 --> 00:42.890
<b>a warrior could ask for.</b>

02:07.640 --> 02:10.730
<b>Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.</b>

02:10.730 --> 02:14.230
<b>Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan 
for my seventh win.</b>

02:15.070 --> 02:19.240
<b>Then I just need to find three more chumps.</b>

02:21.190 --> 02:23.020
<b>And I'll be a Floor Master.</b>

02:23.470 --> 02:27.720
<b>I'll get all the wealth and glory to 
set me up for the rest of my life.</b>

02:32.330 --> 02:33.920
<b>Move, and I will kill you...</b>

02:34.880 --> 02:36.850
<b>Use <i>Nen</i>, and I will kill you.</b>

02:36.850 --> 02:38.620
<b>Make a sound, and I will kill you.</b>

02:39.200 --> 02:41.280
<b>If you understand, slowly close your eyes.</b>

02:43.570 --> 02:46.540
<b>Do you know what happens 
if you break your word?</b>

02:48.240 --> 02:50.770
<b>If you know, slowly open your eyes.</b>

02:51.320 --> 02:53.700
<b>Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.</b>

02:58.190 --> 03:01.450
<b>Never show your filthy face to us again.</b>

03:02.760 --> 03:04.780
<b>That's a promise.</b>

03:04.780 --> 03:09.790
<b>Power x To x Avenge</b>

03:11.420 --> 03:13.770
<b>There are many who would use</b>

03:13.770 --> 03:16.730
<b>underhanded tactics to become a Floor Master.</b>

03:17.560 --> 03:19.700
<b>On the other hand,</b>

03:19.700 --> 03:23.700
<b>Gon has concentrated on improving 
his <i>Nen</i> and growing stronger.</b>

03:23.700 --> 03:24.640
<b>And tonight,</b>

03:24.640 --> 03:26.830
<b>he has his battle with Sadaso.</b>

03:29.210 --> 03:34.310
<b>His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.</b>

03:35.200 --> 03:37.040
<b>I was overcome with despair.</b>

03:37.480 --> 03:39.060
<b>The second he looked at me,</b>

03:39.060 --> 03:41.730
<b>I felt a difference in strength</b>

03:41.730 --> 03:44.850
<b>that made me realize my 
helplessness against him.</b>

03:45.940 --> 03:48.780
<b>It was a mistake to underestimate him,</b>

03:48.780 --> 03:50.950
<b>and to assume he was some normal kid.</b>

03:54.110 --> 03:55.600
<b>I'm gonna disappear</b>

03:55.600 --> 03:57.840
<b>because I don't wanna die...</b>

03:58.250 --> 03:59.750
<b>Be careful.</b>

03:59.750 --> 04:01.990
<b>You guys are next.</b>

04:12.540 --> 04:13.800
<b>What should we do?</b>

04:16.050 --> 04:17.980
<b>I'm still in.</b>

04:17.980 --> 04:20.260
<b>I'll do whatever it takes.</b>

04:21.710 --> 04:23.860
<b>I'm this close to becoming a Floor Master.</b>

04:24.680 --> 04:26.620
<b>Ten victories in the 200s</b>

04:26.620 --> 04:29.870
<b>win you the right to challenge a Floor Master.</b>

04:30.460 --> 04:34.260
<b>Should you triumph, you get 
an entire floor to yourself.</b>

04:36.930 --> 04:40.030
<b>And once you've earned the 
title of Floor Master,</b>

04:40.030 --> 04:42.270
<b>you can lecture, serve as an advisor,</b>

04:42.270 --> 04:45.000
<b>or start a new martial arts school.</b>

04:45.620 --> 04:49.170
<b>You can live off the title for 
the rest of your life.</b>

04:49.760 --> 04:53.580
<b>Will that kid try threatening us?</b>

04:54.350 --> 04:57.360
<b>The boy doesn't know my power.</b>

04:58.480 --> 05:03.260
<b>As long as we're careful, we can handle him.</b>

05:03.260 --> 05:04.420
<b>You're wrong.</b>

05:07.470 --> 05:10.020
<b>It's irrelevant to me what your power is.</b>

05:13.960 --> 05:17.480
<b>I can threaten you whenever I want.</b>

05:19.200 --> 05:21.790
<b>Whenever and wherever I choose...</b>

05:22.450 --> 05:25.170
<b>When you're sound asleep...</b>

05:25.720 --> 05:27.390
<b>When you're taking a dump.</b>

05:28.140 --> 05:29.220
<b>Got it?</b>

05:39.670 --> 05:41.190
<b>Now, listen up.</b>

05:41.740 --> 05:43.570
<b>You have to follow the rules.</b>

05:43.960 --> 05:45.570
<b>Without rules,</b>

05:45.890 --> 05:48.630
<b>we are the ones who would benefit.</b>

06:00.400 --> 06:03.260
<b>Cheating really is a bad idea.</b>

06:03.260 --> 06:05.400
<b>We'll have a fair fight.</b>

06:05.400 --> 06:06.270
<b>Right.</b>

06:13.600 --> 06:15.660
<b>Time has run out for Sadaso.</b>

06:15.660 --> 06:17.600
<b>Gon wins by default!</b>

06:18.000 --> 06:20.260
<b>What? Again?</b>

06:20.260 --> 06:22.790
<b>What is Sadaso doing?</b>

06:24.630 --> 06:30.050
<b>June 1st</b>

06:30.640 --> 06:35.580
<b>June 2nd</b>

06:36.100 --> 06:41.500
<b>June 3rd</b>

06:42.060 --> 06:47.050
<b>June 4th</b>

06:44.530 --> 06:49.020
<b>Okay, Gon-kun is fighting Gido today.</b>

06:49.510 --> 06:53.550
<b>Killua-kun will be facing Riehlvelt.</b>

06:53.990 --> 06:56.090
<b>Are you feeling all right?</b>

06:56.090 --> 06:56.930
<b>Yes.</b>

06:57.410 --> 07:00.190
<b>Gon-kun, this will be your 
second match with Gido.</b>

07:00.660 --> 07:03.200
<b>So you shouldn't require much advice.</b>

07:03.940 --> 07:06.070
<b>Do you have a plan?</b>

07:06.070 --> 07:07.320
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

07:07.320 --> 07:10.320
<b>Um, Wing-san, actually...</b>

07:13.450 --> 07:15.700
<b>I'm planning to use this.</b>

07:17.540 --> 07:19.080
<b>I see...</b>

07:23.030 --> 07:26.680
<b>Okay, today is the long-awaited grudge match...</b>

07:27.260 --> 07:29.740
<b>Gido versus Gon.</b>

07:29.740 --> 07:31.060
<b>In their previous encounter,</b>

07:31.060 --> 07:33.220
<b>Gon ended up in the hospital,</b>

07:33.220 --> 07:34.880
<b>but what will happen this time?</b>

07:34.880 --> 07:38.010
<b>Today, he's carrying a fishing rod.</b>

07:39.580 --> 07:41.850
<b>How does he plan to use it?</b>

07:42.200 --> 07:45.150
<b>How does he intend to fight?</b>

07:45.150 --> 07:46.480
<b>Let's get this contest started!</b>

07:47.390 --> 07:49.570
<b>Points and KO system.</b>

07:49.570 --> 07:51.080
<b>No time limit!</b>

07:51.610 --> 07:52.610
<b>Begin!</b>

07:53.990 --> 07:57.410
<b>Wow! Gon's already taken off!</b>

07:58.640 --> 08:04.040
<b>But Gido was also prepared, as he's 
already using Tornado Top!</b>

08:05.330 --> 08:07.100
<b>If Gon charges in,</b>

08:07.100 --> 08:08.960
<b>he'll be in the same position as before.</b>

08:09.740 --> 08:11.740
<b><i>So he anticipated that.</i></b>

08:13.980 --> 08:16.800
<b><i>I know exactly what you're thinking...</i></b>

08:16.800 --> 08:19.770
<b><i>Once I've begun to spin, 
it's extremely hard to stop me.</i></b>

08:20.250 --> 08:21.520
<b><i>Thus, the logical course</i></b>

08:21.520 --> 08:25.270
<b><i>would be a preemptive attack before I start.</i></b>

08:25.970 --> 08:26.940
<b>What's wrong?</b>

08:26.940 --> 08:29.240
<b>If you won't make a move, I'll go first.</b>

08:29.450 --> 08:31.840
<b><i>Shotgun Blues!</i></b>

08:30.820 --> 08:32.990
<b>Shotgun Blues</b>

08:33.450 --> 08:36.370
<b><i>He can dispatch his tops, even while spinning?</i></b>

08:36.370 --> 08:40.490
<b>This technique is nothing like Battle Waltz.</b>

08:40.620 --> 08:43.640
<b>Every top will be aiming for you.</b>

08:43.640 --> 08:45.620
<b>You can't avoid them all!</b>

08:45.620 --> 08:46.800
<b><i>Ren!</i></b>

08:51.140 --> 08:52.130
<b>What?</b>

08:52.130 --> 08:54.280
<b>He stopped them!</b>

08:54.280 --> 08:55.860
<b>Did you see that?</b>

08:55.860 --> 08:57.140
<b>Wow...</b>

08:57.530 --> 08:58.510
<b>Incredible!</b>

08:58.510 --> 09:01.890
<b>He stopped the tops in their tracks!</b>

09:01.890 --> 09:05.530
<b>He clearly isn't the same 
person as two months ago!</b>

09:10.140 --> 09:13.620
<b><i>His Nen defense is far stronger now.</i></b>

09:13.620 --> 09:15.990
<b><i>I can't win with my tops?</i></b>

09:17.330 --> 09:19.290
<b><i>Gon's reflexes are good enough</i></b>

09:19.290 --> 09:22.250
<b><i>to let him use his rod to knock down any tops</i></b>

09:22.250 --> 09:24.800
<b><i>that are stupid enough to come straight at him.</i></b>

09:25.210 --> 09:27.950
<b><i>But he chose to use Ren</i></b>

09:27.950 --> 09:31.300
<b><i>to deal more psychological damage.</i></b>

09:33.650 --> 09:37.010
<b><i>He must be pretty mad</i></b>

09:37.480 --> 09:39.320
<b><i>about how they used Zushi.</i></b>

09:39.640 --> 09:41.310
<b>It's my turn now!</b>

09:41.660 --> 09:45.430
<b>Well, what technique will Gon use?</b>

09:46.610 --> 09:50.440
<b><i>If he's attacking with that fishing rod, I'd guess</i></b>

09:50.760 --> 09:55.070
<b><i>he'll try to snag me, to stop my spinning.</i></b>

09:55.830 --> 09:58.200
<b><i>But it won't be that simple.</i></b>

10:05.250 --> 10:06.190
<b>There he goes...</b>

10:06.190 --> 10:08.370
<b>Straight for Gido!</b>

10:09.760 --> 10:10.790
<b><i>I knew it.</i></b>

10:11.290 --> 10:12.960
<b><i>But that won't do you any good!</i></b>

10:16.720 --> 10:19.470
<b>Oh, his attack missed!</b>

10:20.860 --> 10:22.720
<b>What were you aiming at?</b>

10:28.540 --> 10:29.740
<b>What?!</b>

10:31.050 --> 10:32.190
<b>Unbelievable...</b>

10:32.190 --> 10:36.070
<b>Gon pulled up the floor, with Gido on it!</b>

10:52.690 --> 10:53.590
<b>Wait!</b>

11:01.920 --> 11:06.860
<b>G-Gon has broken Gido's prosthetic leg.</b>

11:06.860 --> 11:09.740
<b>Gido can no longer continue to fight.</b>

11:10.980 --> 11:13.340
<b>If you're willing to do whatever it takes,</b>

11:13.340 --> 11:15.190
<b>I won't hold back.</b>

11:15.660 --> 11:18.340
<b>And if you touch Zushi again,</b>

11:18.340 --> 11:21.300
<b>I'll smash your face in!</b>

11:27.100 --> 11:29.200
<b>Our winner is Gon!</b>

11:31.240 --> 11:35.400
<b>Gon was able to avenge his initial loss!</b>

11:35.400 --> 11:39.210
<b>His record in the 200s is now 2-1!</b>

11:49.470 --> 11:51.780
<b>Okay, it's my turn now.</b>

11:54.390 --> 11:57.470
<b>All right, up next is our main event...</b>

11:57.470 --> 11:59.190
<b>Killua versus Riehlvelt!</b>

11:59.880 --> 12:02.470
<b>Because Sadaso forfeited the previous match,</b>

12:02.470 --> 12:06.100
<b>this will technically be Killua's debut 200s match.</b>

12:06.100 --> 12:09.290
<b>What will his strategy be?</b>

12:09.950 --> 12:12.770
<b>You're the ones who broke your promise.</b>

12:13.370 --> 12:15.150
<b>I won't let you win now.</b>

12:18.580 --> 12:22.740
<b><i>His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.</i></b>

12:25.090 --> 12:27.360
<b><i>An underworld dweller, huh?</i></b>

12:29.610 --> 12:32.200
<b><i>This boy may be a professional there,</i></b>

12:32.200 --> 12:35.100
<b><i>but Heavens Arena is my turf.</i></b>

12:35.480 --> 12:40.010
<b><i>I'll show him that, on this square stage,</i></b>

12:40.850 --> 12:42.490
<b><i>I'm better.</i></b>

12:46.550 --> 12:49.240
<b>Fight, Killua-san!</b>

12:54.490 --> 12:56.640
<b>Points and KO system.</b>

12:56.640 --> 12:58.040
<b>No time limit!</b>

12:58.690 --> 12:59.750
<b>Begin!</b>

13:02.240 --> 13:03.350
<b><i>He disappeared?</i></b>

13:09.240 --> 13:10.310
<b><i>Behind me!</i></b>

13:10.310 --> 13:11.670
<b><i>Aura Burst!</i></b>

13:10.560 --> 13:14.560
<b>Aura Burst</b>

13:15.110 --> 13:17.940
<b>Wow, he's dashed out of harm's way!</b>

13:18.600 --> 13:22.120
<b>He uses the propulsion created 
by releasing his stored aura</b>

13:22.120 --> 13:24.820
<b>to control his wheelchair at will.</b>

13:25.630 --> 13:27.070
<b><i>I moved too fast.</i></b>

13:27.700 --> 13:30.120
<b><i>Whew, that was close...</i></b>

13:34.660 --> 13:36.450
<b><i>Twin Snakes:</i></b>

13:44.510 --> 13:46.200
<b><i>Song of Defense!</i></b>

13:44.550 --> 13:47.260
<b>Song of Defense</b>

13:47.650 --> 13:48.670
<b>There it is!</b>

13:48.670 --> 13:50.330
<b>His Song of Defense...</b>

13:50.330 --> 13:52.970
<b>Riehlvelt protects himself with two 
whips moving at ridiculous speed,</b>

13:52.970 --> 13:58.170
<b>while he awaits his opportunity to strike.</b>

14:00.130 --> 14:02.760
<b>You planned to attack first and take the lead.</b>

14:02.760 --> 14:04.440
<b>Too bad it didn't work...</b>

14:05.190 --> 14:06.610
<b>Now that I've switched to this stance,</b>

14:06.610 --> 14:09.030
<b>you have no chance of winning.</b>

14:09.360 --> 14:10.410
<b>Why not?</b>

14:11.080 --> 14:12.700
<b>That should be obvious.</b>

14:13.410 --> 14:17.290
<b>A normal person can't even see the whips move!</b>

14:17.290 --> 14:21.540
<b>And this small ring offers no 
means to hide or escape.</b>

14:34.910 --> 14:36.840
<b>Take this!</b>

14:44.410 --> 14:47.610
<b>Sorry, but I'm not a normal person.</b>

14:47.610 --> 14:49.170
<b><i>What?!</i></b>

14:49.810 --> 14:50.740
<b><i>But...</i></b>

14:57.040 --> 14:58.500
<b><i>Thunder Snake!</i></b>

14:57.330 --> 14:58.500
<b>True Twin Snakes: Thunder Snake</b>

15:10.010 --> 15:12.180
<b>I'm astonished, Killua.</b>

15:12.180 --> 15:14.140
<b>You're the first person I've fought</b>

15:14.140 --> 15:16.020
<b>who could see my whips move.</b>

15:16.020 --> 15:18.520
<b>So I have a present for you...</b>

15:18.870 --> 15:22.650
<b>Together, my whips carry a 
one million volt current.</b>

15:22.650 --> 15:26.600
<b>Enough to paralyze and 
incapacitate the largest of men.</b>

15:26.600 --> 15:29.400
<b>Any fool who resists my whips</b>

15:29.400 --> 15:32.040
<b>will fall prey to Thunder Snake!</b>

15:36.720 --> 15:38.450
<b>I'm accustomed to electrical currents</b>

15:38.450 --> 15:40.660
<b>from the torture training I've endured.</b>

15:40.660 --> 15:42.040
<b>It has no effect on me.</b>

15:42.040 --> 15:46.730
<b>But that just means I can bear the pain.</b>

15:47.350 --> 15:49.800
<b>It still hurts.</b>

15:49.800 --> 15:52.180
<b>That's why I'm a little pissed.</b>

15:54.220 --> 15:57.270
<b>If you fall from that height, you'll die!</b>

15:57.880 --> 15:59.060
<b>What do you want?</b>

15:59.060 --> 16:02.280
<b>P-Please catch me!</b>

16:02.280 --> 16:03.230
<b>Okay.</b>

16:04.080 --> 16:05.980
<b>Just come to me.</b>

16:17.500 --> 16:21.960
<b>Man, you realize how painful it is now, idiot?</b>

16:23.650 --> 16:27.220
<b>Riehlvelt has been knocked unconscious.</b>

16:27.220 --> 16:29.090
<b>Our winner is Killua!</b>

16:44.450 --> 16:45.980
<b>Nice, Killua!</b>

16:51.690 --> 16:53.890
<b>You're up next.</b>

16:53.890 --> 16:56.390
<b>You're fighting him in six days?</b>

16:56.390 --> 16:58.620
<b>Uh-huh, June 10th.</b>

16:59.000 --> 17:02.560
<b>My win was only possible 
because of who I am...</b>

17:03.230 --> 17:05.740
<b>If you're hit by those electric whips,</b>

17:05.740 --> 17:08.090
<b>you'll be knocked out cold.</b>

17:08.090 --> 17:09.130
<b>Yeah.</b>

17:10.730 --> 17:12.010
<b>What's your plan?</b>

17:12.420 --> 17:14.760
<b>Don't worry. I have an idea.</b>

17:15.060 --> 17:16.120
<b>Oh?</b>

17:16.990 --> 17:20.130
<b><i>In spirit, you were fighting 
even as you watched me.</i></b>

17:20.130 --> 17:22.770
<b><i>I guess you prefer actual combat 
to being a spectator.</i></b>

17:38.550 --> 17:41.770
<b>June 9th</b>

17:41.400 --> 17:42.800
<b>It appears that the damage</b>

17:42.800 --> 17:46.730
<b>Gido suffered in his match 
with Gon was so severe,</b>

17:46.730 --> 17:49.170
<b>he hasn't returned for today's fight.</b>

17:50.240 --> 17:52.390
<b>Killua wins by default.</b>

17:54.700 --> 17:56.660
<b>June 10th</b>

18:03.300 --> 18:05.850
<b>After losing to Killua,</b>

18:05.850 --> 18:09.310
<b>Riehlvelt's record stands at 5-3, 
leaving him no more chances.</b>

18:09.780 --> 18:12.940
<b>As you know, after four losses, 
you're out of the contest.</b>

18:12.940 --> 18:15.730
<b>You'll have to start over from the beginning.</b>

18:17.470 --> 18:20.110
<b>He appears wary of Gon's speed,</b>

18:20.110 --> 18:22.580
<b>as he already has his whips out.</b>

18:23.600 --> 18:27.700
<b>Meanwhile, Gon isn't carrying his fishing rod...</b>

18:27.700 --> 18:30.670
<b>How does he plan to fight?</b>

18:32.060 --> 18:33.090
<b>Begin!</b>

18:33.900 --> 18:36.840
<b>Oh, Riehlvelt opened with Song of Defense!</b>

18:37.200 --> 18:40.090
<b>Riehlvelt is attempting to end the fight now!</b>

18:44.940 --> 18:48.100
<b>Oh, Gon is squatting?</b>

18:53.170 --> 18:54.290
<b>Amazing...</b>

18:54.290 --> 18:56.990
<b>He pried a floor tile loose by himself!</b>

18:58.600 --> 19:00.950
<b>And then he threw it!</b>

19:00.950 --> 19:02.160
<b><i>Aura Burst!</i></b>

19:03.490 --> 19:05.740
<b>Whoa, he barely managed to escape!</b>

19:07.660 --> 19:10.000
<b><i>He left that escape route open on purpose.</i></b>

19:11.110 --> 19:11.970
<b>What?</b>

19:11.970 --> 19:16.110
<b>However, Gon has already anticipated him.</b>

19:18.220 --> 19:22.870
<b><i>When you try to escape, 
every fraction of a second counts.</i></b>

19:22.870 --> 19:25.490
<b><i>And since there isn't time to change direction,</i></b>

19:25.490 --> 19:27.800
<b><i>you're forced to move forward...</i></b>

19:29.310 --> 19:33.380
<b><i>And when you dash quickly, 
you're usually off-balance.</i></b>

19:33.380 --> 19:37.480
<b><i>His only option is to stop the whips.</i></b>

19:38.400 --> 19:40.400
<b><i>That's where you get him...</i></b>

19:58.660 --> 20:00.420
<b>This is the switch?</b>

20:00.420 --> 20:01.690
<b>Let's see...</b>

20:01.690 --> 20:03.860
<b>I'll turn the power to maximum.</b>

20:04.570 --> 20:05.800
<b>S-Stop...</b>

20:05.800 --> 20:09.190
<b>Switch</b>

20:07.510 --> 20:09.190
<b>Stop it!</b>

20:09.190 --> 20:13.070
<b>on!</b>

20:20.720 --> 20:22.120
<b>Just kidding.</b>

20:24.120 --> 20:27.700
<b>Riehlvelt has fallen unconscious.</b>

20:27.700 --> 20:29.830
<b>Our winner is Gon!</b>

20:32.060 --> 20:33.830
<b>Gon-san!</b>

21:02.580 --> 21:05.320
<b>Yes, that truly was impressive.</b>

21:05.320 --> 21:07.600
<b>I can see the progress you've made</b>

21:07.600 --> 21:09.870
<b>from these last two fights.</b>

21:12.320 --> 21:16.250
<b>Feel free to pick a time and place...</b>

21:18.240 --> 21:20.830
<b>I shall be your opponent.</b>

21:39.200 --> 21:41.370
<b>Hisoka has recognized the strength</b>

21:41.370 --> 21:43.760
<b>Gon demonstrated during his matches.</b>

21:44.140 --> 21:48.200
<b>Their fight will soon begin.</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.650
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.620 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.470 --> 23:08.320
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.320 --> 23:09.610
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.740 --> 23:19.960
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.610 --> 23:11.640
<b>Today, we introduce Cocco.</b>

23:10.970 --> 23:14.660
<b>A Heavens Arena 
commentator.</b>

23:11.640 --> 23:14.440
<b>She's a Heavens Arena commentator.</b>

23:14.440 --> 23:17.040
<b>Oh, the lady who's always talking?</b>

23:14.660 --> 23:19.920
<b>She knows how to get 
the crowd excited.</b>

23:17.040 --> 23:19.090
<b>I wonder how many of her there are.</b>

23:19.090 --> 23:20.460
<b>Uh, there's just one!</b>

23:24.730 --> 23:27.300
<b>Next time: The x True x Pass!</b>

23:27.300 --> 23:28.260
<b>Hey, Killua.</b>

23:28.260 --> 23:30.300
<b>What does "yadda yadda" mean?</b>

23:30.300 --> 23:31.660
<b>You don't know?</b>

23:31.660 --> 23:33.930
<b>It means ya da and ya da.</b>
