02:34.779 --> 02:35.821
The short answer is,

02:35.989 --> 02:38.031
this is the work of the same ghoul
who killed Laura.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.700
More fan mail.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.744
The letter O
under Maddy's ring fingernail.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.581
There were strands of fur
clutched in her right hand.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.292
- What kind of fur?
- White fox.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.587
The strands were laced with
formaldehyde. A dead animal, stuffed.

02:52.338 --> 02:56.008
I'll make phone calls. Leland will know
how to get a hold of Maddy's family.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.801
Harry, don't make any calls.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.554
- I need 24 hours.
- For what?

03:00.763 --> 03:02.181
To finish this.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.891
Cooper.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.645
In observation...

03:10.648 --> 03:12.900
...I don't know where this is headed.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.860
But the only one of us
with coordinates

03:15.028 --> 03:17.654
for this destination and its hardware
is you.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.823
Go on whatever vision quest
you require.

03:19.991 --> 03:24.077
Stand on the rim of the volcano,
stand alone and do your dance.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.080
Just find this beast
before he takes another bite.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.088
God help me,
I don't know where to start.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.050
You're on the path.
You don't need to know where it leads.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.968
Just follow.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.688
I thought you'd never get here.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.400
I went for a ride this morning.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.528
God, the engine sounded like
a thousand people singing.

03:58.696 --> 04:02.074
- What were they singing about?
- What do you think?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.535
Last night?
I could sing about last night.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.913
I got something for you.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.419
Open it.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.883
Oh, James.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.803
I didn't know what size to get.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.014
And the girl at the jewelry store
had these really big hands.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.476
But I'll bet...

04:30.311 --> 04:31.937
Perfect.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.981
James.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.485
I just think we should
be together all the time.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.778
Really?

04:40.154 --> 04:41.947
If that's okay with you.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.158
It's perfect. Heh.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.380
Ew.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.427
Whatever fowl
did you take these eggs from?

05:03.636 --> 05:06.388
Are we saying we don't like it?

05:06.597 --> 05:08.640
I'm afraid I'm gonna
run into a thumbtack.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.521
Mother, can't you ever say
anything nice?

05:14.689 --> 05:18.108
I've tried so hard.
I try so hard,

05:18.318 --> 05:20.694
and nothing is good enough for you.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.740
Let me correct myself. Nothing I do
is ever good enough for you.

05:25.199 --> 05:28.285
Well, that's not true.
The menus are very presentable.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.829
Oh, I'm joking.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.999
Honestly,
let me make a suggestion.

05:34.208 --> 05:38.545
If you wanna serve
a truly memorable omelet,

05:38.713 --> 05:43.592
try white veal sausage
and morel mushrooms.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.429
Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.948
What did you say?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.576
Nothing.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.787
Hello, Donna.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.914
Hello, James.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.916
What did you say?

06:16.626 --> 06:19.378
- It's French.
- I know it is, tell me.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.630
Donna, what's the big deal?

06:29.055 --> 06:30.389
You know Mrs. Tremond?

06:30.932 --> 06:33.100
- Miss who?
- Mrs. Tremond.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.644
Her grandson does the magic tricks.
He told me this.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.813
But it was Mr. Smith.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.360
- Harold?
- He left a suicide note.

06:45.279 --> 06:49.282
You know, it means,
"I am a lonely soul."

06:50.618 --> 06:52.494
I have to find Agent Cooper.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.666
Donna, what's going on?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.209
Hey.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.429
Mrs. Tremond's the one
who told me about Harold Smith.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.306
She has a grandson
and he said this to me.

07:13.474 --> 07:16.143
The same words that are in
Harold Smith's suicide note.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.228
Maybe the boy
said the same thing to Harold.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.939
No, Harold's world was in his words.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.233
The suicide note has to be
a message.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.527
It all leads back here.

07:28.364 --> 07:32.242
She's pretty old. It might take a second
if her grandson isn't here.

07:34.912 --> 07:38.999
- May I, uh, help you?
- Is Mrs. Tremond home?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.126
I'm Mrs. Tremond.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.420
It must have been your mother
I spoke to.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.506
My mother?
She passed away three years ago.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.966
I live here alone, honey.

07:48.426 --> 07:52.137
No, she was here. I spoke to her.
And her grandson, he was here too.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.014
But I have no children.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.807
But he was here.
They both were.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.476
Donna, we'd better go.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.978
Donna?
Are you Donna Hayward?

08:00.605 --> 08:03.398
- Yeah.
- Just a moment.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.109
I've never seen her before in my life.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.320
I thought you delivered meals here.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.948
Uh, the morning after poor Harold
died, I found this in my mail.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.742
I meant to turn it in.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.202
It's for you.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.040
Thank you.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.546
- It's Harold's handwriting.
- Open it, Donna.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.142
It's Laura's diary,
a page from her diary.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.727
Read it.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.732
"February 22nd.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.527
Last night I had
the strangest dream.

08:48.694 --> 08:52.072
I was in a red room
with a small man dressed in red

08:52.240 --> 08:54.533
and an old man sitting in a chair.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.201
I tried to talk to him.

08:56.369 --> 09:00.080
I wanted to tell him who Bob is
because I thought he could help me.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.250
My words came out slow and odd.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.211
It was frustrating trying to talk.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.381
I got up and walked to the old man.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.718
Then I leaned over and whispered
the secret in his ear.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.682
Somebody has to stop Bob.

09:18.849 --> 09:23.270
Bob's only afraid of one man,
he told me once.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.689
A man named Mike.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.192
I wonder if this was Mike
in my dream.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.363
Even if it was only a dream,
I hope he heard me.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.658
No one in the real world
would believe me.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.869
February 23rd.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.205
Tonight is the night that I die.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.543
I know I have to
because it's the only way

09:46.752 --> 09:48.837
to keep Bob away from me.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.923
The only way to tear him out
from inside.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.635
I know he wants me,
I can feel his fire.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.680
But if I die,
he can't hurt me anymore."

10:04.437 --> 10:06.980
Laura and I had the same dream.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.483
- That's impossible.
- Yes, it is.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.489
Deputy, take Donna home.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.908
I've got to see Gerard.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.300
He's completely dehydrated.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.386
His breathing is becoming
more difficult. He needs that drug.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.847
Mike.
Mike, I need you to talk to me.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.724
- Any longer could kill him.
- Mike.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.317
Bob has killed again.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.404
I need to know something.
I need you to help me.

10:57.948 --> 11:01.576
Bob was in my dream, Laura Palmer
was in my dream, so were you.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.704
And Laura dreamt about me
the night before she died.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.331
The same dream that I had.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.542
I need to unlock that.
I need... The answer is inside of me.

11:09.752 --> 11:14.339
Bob and I,
when we were killing together,

11:14.965 --> 11:18.510
there was this perfect relationship,

11:18.678 --> 11:20.345
appetite,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.180
satisfaction,

11:22.348 --> 11:24.307
a golden circle.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.476
A golden circle.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.147
A ring.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.649
My ring.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.984
I gave my ring to the Giant.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.154
He is known to us here.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.614
Then he's real?

11:40.199 --> 11:41.866
As real as I.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.664
He can help you find Bob.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.626
- How?
- You must ask him first.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.586
How do I do that?

11:54.213 --> 12:00.176
Oh, you have all the clues you need.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.766
The answer is not here, my friend.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.854
The answer is here.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.230
I don't understand.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.527
So much responsibility.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.766
I know about you.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.854
That milk will cool down on you

12:53.022 --> 12:56.191
but it's getting warmer now.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.447
"Getting warmer now."

13:13.375 --> 13:15.919
Box and tag everything
in these drawers. Everything.

13:16.086 --> 13:19.214
Coop, we found his telephone records.
Look at this.

13:19.381 --> 13:22.675
The night Laura died.
Telephone call Leland told us about.

13:22.843 --> 13:26.054
Ben called her number
from this office.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.722
White fox.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.434
Yeah, white, dead and stuffed.
Maddy was here.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.522
I think Ben killed her in this office,
then took her to the waterfall.

13:35.689 --> 13:39.067
He killed Laura
and he killed Maddy.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.277
Madeleine Ferguson died
the night before last

13:41.445 --> 13:43.154
between 10 p.m. and midnight.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.949
That fits. We didn't take Ben in
until after midnight.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.326
That's as close as I can cut it.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.579
Ben Horne's blood test.

14:00.047 --> 14:04.175
A couple of minutes, I'll have this up
to code. Tweaking the sensors, mostly.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.553
Don't want your sprinklers
to be overly jumpy.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.471
Gotta set it just so.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.392
I wanna talk about my child,
our baby.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.937
- Maybe.
- Maybe what?

14:16.480 --> 14:19.649
Maybe it is our baby
and maybe it isn't.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.442
Dick?

14:21.610 --> 14:23.862
Oh, my Lord, is he the father?

14:24.071 --> 14:26.698
At first I thought
you were the father.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.534
But then you said
you didn't have any sperms.

14:31.287 --> 14:35.874
Then I thought it was Dick, but now
you say your sperms are back.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.627
So as far as I can tell,
it's a 50-50 proposition.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.215
Andy, where are you going?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.551
What are you doing?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.930
Who are you calling?

14:51.307 --> 14:54.183
I want to speak to Richard Tremayne,
Men's Fashions.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.436
Yes, I'll hold.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.105
You won't hurt him, will you, Andy?

15:01.400 --> 15:04.319
Tremayne, Brennan.
Andy Brennan.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.112
We need to talk.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.866
That is, if you're not too busy.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.006
Tojamura-san.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.343
How nice of you to come calling.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.762
You are in prison.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.848
Yes, well,

15:34.016 --> 15:37.477
a momentary inconvenience,
I assure you.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.939
We have papers to sign.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.150
The Ghostwood contracts.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.196
Tojamura-san,

15:48.364 --> 15:52.033
I'm afraid there's, uh...
There's been a snag.

15:52.576 --> 15:53.826
A snag?

15:53.994 --> 15:57.789
Unforeseen difficulties.
Some legal in nature, others, uh...

15:58.540 --> 16:03.544
I, uh... I'm unable to sign
the Ghostwood agreement at this time.

16:03.712 --> 16:07.674
Then you will return
my 5 million dollars.

16:08.300 --> 16:12.053
Well, I want to return your money.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.138
I want to sign the contracts.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.600
Tojamura-san,

16:18.435 --> 16:20.436
as you can see,

16:20.604 --> 16:22.522
I am incarcerated.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.775
Falsely accused,

16:27.069 --> 16:30.196
but my brother, heh, the boy genius,

16:30.364 --> 16:34.075
is out looking for a better lawyer.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.161
And until justice is done,

16:37.329 --> 16:43.835
until I am able to breathe the air
that free men breathe,

16:45.671 --> 16:48.423
I plead with you for understanding.

16:50.926 --> 16:56.264
This is the long, dark night
of my soul.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.183
Time to seek that...

17:00.269 --> 17:04.605
...tiny flickering flame within.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.276
Forgive me,
I've been very emotional lately.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.834
Catherine?

17:25.127 --> 17:27.587
Benjamin Horne.

17:27.755 --> 17:32.008
You're a slimy rat bastard.

17:32.176 --> 17:36.721
And I intend to make whatever
remains of your pathetic existence

17:36.889 --> 17:38.598
a living hell.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.767
Oh, Catherine.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.810
Oh! Ha, ha.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.188
Oh, my God.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.607
You've come.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.695
Oh, Catherine.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.656
Catherine, Catherine,
tell Sheriff Truman

17:55.866 --> 17:58.284
about the night
that we spent together

17:58.452 --> 18:01.329
the night that Laura was killed.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.083
You want me to beg? Huh?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.210
You want me to beg?
Because I'll beg.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.297
Will you sign Ghostwood
and the mill over to me?

18:12.633 --> 18:14.133
In a heartbeat.

18:16.637 --> 18:20.014
Oh. Clever disguise, Catherine.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.016
Really brilliant. Oh.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.729
Signed, sealed

18:26.897 --> 18:30.024
and delivered.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.819
Now, you'll tell the sheriff, huh?

18:32.986 --> 18:34.821
You'll tell the sheriff.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.156
I'll consider it.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.952
Catherine. Catherine, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.163
It's the truth, after all.

18:44.373 --> 18:49.001
Heh, why, Ben, we've spent our entire
adult lives lying to each other.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.629
Why spoil it with the truth now?

18:54.007 --> 18:58.052
Catherine.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.181
Catherine!

19:03.142 --> 19:04.517
Donna,

19:04.685 --> 19:07.353
I'm so happy you stopped by.

19:08.021 --> 19:12.024
We haven't had the time
to just sit down and talk for so long.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.861
May I get you a glass of lemonade?

19:15.070 --> 19:19.073
No, thanks, Mr. Palmer.
I only have a minute. Uh...

19:19.241 --> 19:22.702
This is for Maddy. It's a tape
of a song we did with James.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.620
I want her to have a copy.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.664
That's very sweet of you.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.666
She told me all about this.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.419
She said it was
a very enjoyable experience.

19:31.587 --> 19:35.256
Anyway, if you could mail it to her,
I'd really appreciate it.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.301
No, it won't be any problem at all.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.390
Heh. Is something wrong?

19:44.558 --> 19:46.184
No.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.645
Those glasses.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.191
They were Laura's.
Maddy gave them to me.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.194
I thought they looked familiar.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.629
- Mr. Palmer,
- Huh?

20:14.796 --> 20:18.132
did you know
that they found Laura's secret diary?

20:18.926 --> 20:23.387
Diary? Yes,
they took it from her room.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.766
No, not the one the police found.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.476
She had another one.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.312
I didn't even know about it,
did you?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.148
No.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.984
She gave it to a man
named Harold Smith.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.614
Harold killed himself a few days ago.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.741
The police found it in his apartment.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.576
Oh, my God.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.454
I had no idea.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.416
I wish I knew what was in it,
don't you?

20:52.751 --> 20:55.086
I think about Laura all the time.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.134
Oh, excuse me.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.807
Hello?

21:08.100 --> 21:11.060
Yeah, Beth, how are you?

21:11.895 --> 21:14.146
No, not since yesterday.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.650
Of course, Beth. I took Maddy
to the bus station myself.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.278
Well, I...

21:20.445 --> 21:24.031
I'm sure there must be some
perfectly reasonable explanation.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.867
Yes, of course.
I'll call you immediately,

21:27.035 --> 21:28.494
within the hour.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.954
Bye, Beth.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.253
Huh.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.172
Maddy?

21:41.466 --> 21:43.634
It's the strangest thing.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.553
She never made it home.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.596
Oh, God.

21:53.020 --> 21:57.356
Oh. Donna, don't you worry
about a thing.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.693
I'll get us some lemonade

22:00.986 --> 22:04.196
and we'll sit down
and give it a think

22:04.406 --> 22:07.158
and we'll work the problem out.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.410
Together.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.410
I knew she was expecting us,
I mean...

22:51.578 --> 22:53.996
I guess I was selfish.
I thought I could see her any time.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.956
Missoula's not that far away, right?

22:56.124 --> 22:59.794
Donna, you're taking this much
too much to heart.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.505
I'm sure she's just fine.

23:03.924 --> 23:06.467
I know the cure for what ails you.

23:06.635 --> 23:07.802
It's simple, really.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.262
It always makes me feel good.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.183
May we have this dance...

23:56.560 --> 23:58.185
...please?

24:37.559 --> 24:39.518
You stay right there.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.612
Harry?

24:49.779 --> 24:51.697
Leland, we need your help.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.240
What is it?

24:53.408 --> 24:55.951
- There's been another murder.
- Oh, my God.

24:56.119 --> 25:00.206
I can't tell you why or how but we need
your help and we need it right away.

25:00.373 --> 25:03.250
All right, anything, certainly.
Let me get my coat.

25:11.176 --> 25:15.930
Maddy.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.743
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

25:38.245 --> 25:41.121
- It's Maddy.
- What about her?

25:41.498 --> 25:42.957
She's dead.

25:43.542 --> 25:47.211
It was the same killer.
The same one who killed Laura.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.134
I heard Mr. Palmer get a phone call
from her mother.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.095
She said
she hadn't gotten home yet.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.764
Then they came over to talk to him,
Sheriff Truman.

25:58.932 --> 26:02.601
- We could've helped her.
- How?

26:02.769 --> 26:04.353
I don't know.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.692
- This is no good.
- What do you mean?

26:10.235 --> 26:12.027
You mean us?

26:14.990 --> 26:18.784
- I gotta go.
- James, it's not our fault, don't leave.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.744
It doesn't matter, don't you see?

26:20.954 --> 26:24.081
Nothing we do matters.
Nothing's ever gonna change.

26:24.249 --> 26:28.919
It doesn't matter if we're happy
and the rest of the world goes to hell.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.173
James, don't leave.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.468
James, don't leave me!

27:21.348 --> 27:22.848
Harry.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.893
Leland.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.605
Why are we here, Agent Cooper?

27:30.690 --> 27:32.775
Is someone meeting us?

27:32.942 --> 27:34.443
Yes.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.403
Is it the killer?

27:36.571 --> 27:39.281
I don't know. Maybe.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.912
Ed, glad you're here.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.665
I need everyone's help
to clear the room.

27:47.832 --> 27:50.668
I need a large space in the center.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.629
Of course.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.726
Hail, hail. The gang's all here.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.564
Bobby, why don't you wheel Leo
back over there?

28:12.732 --> 28:14.483
Stay very, very quiet, you read me?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.735
Give yourself a raise, Hawk.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.413
Gentlemen, two days ago
a young woman was found murdered

28:27.580 --> 28:29.665
by the same individual,
I believe, responsible

28:29.833 --> 28:32.126
for the death of Laura Palmer.

28:33.044 --> 28:37.256
I have reason to believe
that the killer is in this room.

28:38.007 --> 28:40.551
As a member of the Bureau,
I spend most of my time

28:40.719 --> 28:43.804
seeking simple answers
to difficult questions.

28:44.013 --> 28:47.599
In the pursuit of Laura's killer,
I have employed Bureau guidelines,

28:47.767 --> 28:53.731
deductive technique,
Tibetan method, instinct and luck.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.567
But now I find myself
in need of something new,

28:56.735 --> 29:00.779
which for lack of a better word
we shall call "magic."

29:06.161 --> 29:08.370
Would you like us to hum?

29:09.164 --> 29:10.873
A Tibetan chant, perhaps.

29:12.292 --> 29:16.003
I think it's going terrifically well,
don't you?

29:17.380 --> 29:19.006
Now what?

29:20.049 --> 29:22.468
Harry, I'm not completely sure.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.138
Someone is missing.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.773
Excuse us.

29:36.399 --> 29:39.026
Major Briggs, right on time.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.153
I was on my way home.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.072
This kind gentleman
flagged me down,

29:44.240 --> 29:47.075
asked if I could drive him here.

30:01.424 --> 30:05.219
I know that gum.
I used to chew it when I was a kid.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.971
That's my most favorite gum
in the world.

30:08.181 --> 30:11.767
That gum you like
is going to come back in style.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.995
My father

30:32.247 --> 30:34.581
killed me.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.169
Ben Horne,

31:21.379 --> 31:23.881
I would like you to accompany me
to the sheriff's station.

31:25.341 --> 31:28.635
You might like to bring along
Leland Palmer as your attorney.

32:16.976 --> 32:19.603
Let's take him down to interrogation.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.233
Agent Cooper,
is he going to be charged?

32:25.401 --> 32:26.860
Yes.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.072
Then I think I'd like to begin bail
proceedings as soon as possible.

32:30.239 --> 32:32.240
He'll have his day in court.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.662
Harry.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.643
Everything will be all right, Ben.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.413
Hawk, take Ben upstairs
and release him.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.748
- Leland?
- That's not Leland.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.128
How did you know?

33:26.295 --> 33:28.797
Laura told me in her dream.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.258
We're gonna need
a lot stronger evidence than this.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.427
How about a confession, Harry?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.556
You have the right to an attorney.

33:37.765 --> 33:41.059
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

33:55.658 --> 34:00.037
Oh, yeah. I suppose you wanna
ask him some questions, huh?

34:00.955 --> 34:03.290
Did you kill Laura Palmer?

34:09.422 --> 34:10.881
That's a yes.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.258
How about Madeleine Ferguson?

34:13.468 --> 34:15.177
- What do you think?
- I'm asking you.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.262
- What do you think?
- Answer the question.

34:17.430 --> 34:20.724
Oh, gosh, gee, gee whiz.
I guess I kind of sort of did.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.768
I have this thing for knives.

34:22.935 --> 34:25.729
Just like what happened to you
in Pittsburgh that time.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.731
Huh, Cooper?

34:29.692 --> 34:31.359
Oh, Leland.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.779
Leland, Leland.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.947
You've been a good vehicle

34:36.157 --> 34:38.325
and I've enjoyed the ride.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.827
But now he's weak and full of holes.

34:40.995 --> 34:43.830
It's almost nearly time
to shuffle off to Buffalo.

34:45.249 --> 34:46.958
Does Leland know
what you've done?

34:47.168 --> 34:49.586
Ah, Leland's a babe in the woods

34:49.754 --> 34:53.882
with a large hole
where his conscience used to be.

34:54.050 --> 34:57.886
And when I go, children,
I will pull that ripcord

34:58.054 --> 35:01.598
and you watch Leland, remember.
Watch him.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.767
But not for long.

35:13.402 --> 35:14.945
That's enough for me.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.136
Dick,

35:39.428 --> 35:41.847
could you come with me, please?

35:47.728 --> 35:50.897
Okay, here's how
this is going to work.

35:51.107 --> 35:54.359
- I'm going to keep my baby.
- Oh.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.653
That's not open for discussion.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.615
- I see.
- Be quiet, let her talk.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.742
Got a light?

36:07.540 --> 36:08.623
No.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.836
You were saying.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.715
There's only one way to handle this.

36:16.883 --> 36:20.594
They have a test to determine
the blood type of the father.

36:20.761 --> 36:22.554
It could be you

36:22.763 --> 36:24.431
or it could be you.

36:25.141 --> 36:28.935
They won't be doing this test
until after the baby is born,

36:29.145 --> 36:32.105
during which time
I expect complete cooperation

36:32.315 --> 36:34.774
from each of you two gentlemen.

36:34.942 --> 36:37.068
Whatever you say, Lucy.

36:37.653 --> 36:39.362
I mean, it is your baby.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.239
Thank you.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.461
Ben Horne's blood test,
he's the wrong type.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.923
Harry, the answer was right in front
of me from the very beginning.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.842
What did the little man do
in my dream?

37:03.221 --> 37:04.471
He danced.

37:04.680 --> 37:08.016
After Laura's death,
Leland danced compulsively.

37:08.184 --> 37:11.311
We were told that Bob the killer
was a gray-haired man.

37:11.479 --> 37:14.481
When Leland killed Jacques,
his hair turned gray overnight.

37:14.690 --> 37:16.233
Leland said when he was a child

37:16.400 --> 37:18.944
the gray-haired man next door
was named Robertson.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.821
Mike said the people Bob inhabited
were his children.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.699
Robertson, son of Robert.

37:24.867 --> 37:27.285
The letters under the fingernails:
R, O, B, T.

37:27.453 --> 37:28.912
Bob was spelling his name.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.331
A signature on a demon self-portrait.

37:31.832 --> 37:33.166
Why would he kill her?

37:33.376 --> 37:35.293
Laura was writing about Bob
in her diary.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.588
Leland found it, ripped out the pages.
She knew he was on to her.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.299
It was Leland who placed that call
from Ben Horne's office

37:41.467 --> 37:42.926
to Laura the night she died.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.262
He was the third man
outside Jacques' cabin.

37:45.471 --> 37:49.474
He took the girls to the train car. It was
his blood we found, not Ben Horne's.

37:49.976 --> 37:53.436
- Then why kill Maddy?
- Maybe she reminded him of Laura.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.314
Maddy was going home.
He couldn't bear to part with her.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.024
He wanted to relive the experience

37:58.192 --> 38:01.194
or maybe she realized
Bob was the killer and he found out.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.656
Now, this Bob.

38:04.824 --> 38:08.868
He can't really exist.
I mean, Leland is just crazy, right?

38:09.245 --> 38:12.247
Through the dark of futures past

38:12.415 --> 38:15.625
The magician longs to see

38:15.793 --> 38:19.254
One chants out between two worlds

38:19.463 --> 38:22.882
Fire walk with me

38:24.427 --> 38:27.345
I'll catch you with my death bag

38:27.513 --> 38:30.056
You may think I've gone insane

38:30.224 --> 38:34.060
But I promise I will kill again!

39:07.053 --> 39:08.803
Harry, hurry.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.180
The key.

39:12.641 --> 39:16.978
Leland!

39:17.146 --> 39:19.606
Harry. Leland.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.741
Call an ambulance.

39:31.160 --> 39:34.204
Oh, God, Laura.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.206
I killed her.

39:36.374 --> 39:40.126
Oh, my God. I killed my daughter.

39:40.669 --> 39:42.170
I didn't know.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.172
Laura, forgive me.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.508
Forgive me.

39:46.842 --> 39:49.219
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.346
It's all right.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.475
I was just a boy.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.561
I saw him in my dreams.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.648
He said he wanted to play.

40:02.566 --> 40:07.862
He opened me and I invited him
and he came inside me.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.322
He went inside?

40:09.490 --> 40:13.785
When he was inside, I didn't know.

40:14.161 --> 40:19.165
And when he was gone,
I couldn't remember.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.668
He made me do things...

40:22.628 --> 40:24.504
...terrible things.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.298
He said he wanted lives,

40:27.466 --> 40:29.008
he wanted others.

40:29.176 --> 40:34.013
Others that they could use
like they used me.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.266
Like Laura?

40:36.434 --> 40:37.851
They wanted her.

40:38.018 --> 40:41.187
They wanted Laura,
but she was strong.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.106
She fought them.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.483
She wouldn't let them in.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.153
Oh, God.

40:48.487 --> 40:51.906
They had me kill that girl, Theresa.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.995
And they... They said...

40:57.455 --> 41:00.290
...if I didn't give them Laura,

41:00.458 --> 41:03.376
they'd have me kill her too.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.546
But she wouldn't let them in?

41:08.674 --> 41:13.261
She said she'd die
before she let them.

41:14.555 --> 41:17.474
And they made me kill her.

41:18.851 --> 41:22.562
Oh, God, have mercy on me.

41:23.481 --> 41:29.110
What have I done?

41:29.737 --> 41:34.115
Oh, God, I love her.

41:34.283 --> 41:37.994
I loved her with all my heart.

41:39.205 --> 41:42.081
My angel, forgive me.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.589
Leland.

41:55.513 --> 41:59.098
Leland, the time has come
for you to seek the path.

41:59.808 --> 42:03.061
Your soul has set you
face to face with a clear light

42:03.229 --> 42:06.731
and you are now about to experience it
in its reality,

42:06.899 --> 42:10.527
wherein all things are like the void
and cloudless sky

42:10.903 --> 42:15.698
and the naked, spotless intellect
is like a transparent vacuum

42:15.866 --> 42:18.952
without circumference or center.

42:19.411 --> 42:22.163
Leland, in this moment,
know yourself

42:22.581 --> 42:24.999
and abide in that state.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.504
Look to the light, Leland.

42:30.005 --> 42:32.006
Find the light.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.551
I see it.

42:35.803 --> 42:39.681
Into the light, Leland.
Into the light.

42:40.099 --> 42:43.560
I see her.

42:44.270 --> 42:47.063
She's there.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.649
Into the light, Leland.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.652
She's beautiful.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.988
Into the light.

42:57.366 --> 42:59.200
Laura.

43:00.035 --> 43:02.078
Don't be afraid.

43:58.927 --> 44:01.721
He was completely insane.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.348
Think so?

44:03.557 --> 44:05.350
But people saw Bob.

44:05.517 --> 44:10.355
People saw him in visions:
Laura, Maddy, Sarah Palmer.

44:10.606 --> 44:13.399
Gentlemen,
there's more in heaven and earth

44:13.567 --> 44:15.818
than is dreamt up in our philosophy.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.654
Amen.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.825
Well, I've lived in these old woods
most of my life.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.163
I've seen some strange things
but this is way off the map.

44:27.331 --> 44:30.750
I'm having a hard time believing.

44:31.210 --> 44:32.752
Harry, is it easier to believe

44:32.920 --> 44:35.755
a man would rape and murder
his own daughter?

44:36.173 --> 44:38.216
Any more comforting?

44:38.801 --> 44:40.385
No.

44:41.428 --> 44:46.265
An evil that great
in this beautiful world...

44:47.893 --> 44:50.895
Finally,
does it matter what the cause?

44:51.397 --> 44:55.149
Yes, because it's our job to stop it.

44:56.568 --> 44:57.902
Yeah.

45:02.616 --> 45:05.076
Maybe that's all Bob is.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.578
The evil that men do.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.832
Maybe it doesn't matter
what we call it.

45:10.999 --> 45:12.709
Maybe not.

45:14.628 --> 45:16.963
But if he was real, if he was here,

45:17.131 --> 45:18.923
and we had him trapped

45:19.091 --> 45:21.050
and he got away,

45:22.261 --> 46:47.303
where's Bob now?
