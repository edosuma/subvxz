00:09.309 --> 00:12.912
New York City continues
to change every year.

00:12.946 --> 00:17.851
It becomes more luxurious
and more exclusive.

00:17.884 --> 00:21.021
To work here and to live here,
you have to change too.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.756
Hey, it's Ryan.

00:22.789 --> 00:25.025
In the past year,
I've realized that

00:25.058 --> 00:28.061
you don't have to be
so ruthless to get ahead.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.796
You just have to be smart.

00:29.829 --> 00:33.199
I'm going to partner
with all the right people.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.267
Hey.

00:36.903 --> 00:38.204
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.874
I thought Luis
was that guy.

00:40.907 --> 00:43.610
We did a deal together
last year,

00:43.643 --> 00:47.247
but it occurred to me very
quickly that we don't see life

00:47.280 --> 00:49.115
or business the same way.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.884
Maybe he was trying
to help you.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.753
Life is too short to work
with unreasonable people.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.255
(Ryan)
I take
Fredrik's point of view here.

00:55.288 --> 00:57.924
Because you bend over for--
for business.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.559
(Ryan)
I haven't seen Luis in months.

00:59.592 --> 01:02.262
My calls have gone unanswered.
He doesn't respond to my emails.

01:02.295 --> 01:07.067
So I'm considering all options,
and I do mean all.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.268
So what's going on?

01:08.301 --> 01:12.272
Well, um, I have a project
coming up in a couple of months,

01:12.305 --> 01:16.076
on 19th Street,
and maybe this could be

01:16.076 --> 01:17.877
something we could do together.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.080
So did you tell Luis about
19th Street and he said no?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.715
Luis?
Why would I tell him?

01:22.782 --> 01:24.184
I'm gonna let you
tell him.

01:24.217 --> 01:27.587
Uh, I haven't seen Luis,
actually.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.222
I thought
you were best friends.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.591
Luis doesn't pick up
the phone.

01:31.624 --> 01:35.295
He thinks that he's bigger
and better than everybody else.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.864
I'm not gonna lie,
you know, when I called Ryan

01:37.897 --> 01:39.232
to have breakfast,

01:39.265 --> 01:42.235
the first thing
that hit my mind was, like,

01:42.268 --> 01:44.371
I'm gonna break up
that alliance.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.940
His ego is just like
bam.

01:46.973 --> 01:50.110
But it sounds like
I don't have to.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.544
So I'll email you.
We'll set it up.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.646
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's do it.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.249
- I'm looking forward.
- Me too.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.118
Ryan and I had
so many disagreements

01:58.118 --> 01:59.719
over the last few years,
right?

01:59.753 --> 02:02.222
Give a kiss to Emilia,
in all the right places.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.056
Gross.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.158
But last year

02:05.191 --> 02:10.063
I saw this side in him
which made me curious.

02:10.063 --> 02:13.066
I mean, this industry is
all about helping each other,

02:13.066 --> 02:16.269
learning from each other,
working together.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.370
This weekend is jam packed.

02:17.404 --> 02:21.941
Yes.
Let's find out...

02:21.975 --> 02:24.678
God knows I tried.
Luis did not want my help.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.079
You don't understand
what I'm trying to teach you.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.114
You're not helping me.
You're dis-helping me.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.918
I'm not gonna be your partner.
I'm gonna be your competitor.

02:31.951 --> 02:35.221
(Fredrik)
So I am moving on.

02:35.255 --> 02:37.424
I hate this guy.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.858
To be quite frank,

02:38.892 --> 02:41.961
I don't regret anything
that I have said about Fredrik.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.396
[laughs]

02:43.430 --> 02:44.898
[bleep] hate him.

02:44.931 --> 02:48.435
A lot of brokers would do
absolutely anything for money

02:48.468 --> 02:51.204
almost to the extent
of losing their integrity,

02:51.237 --> 02:52.772
you know, like Ryan.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.275
Going forward, you and I,
we take care of each other.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.110
Ryan is the kind of person
that will tell you

02:57.110 --> 02:58.111
he has your back forever,

02:58.111 --> 02:59.713
but he will choose business
over you

02:59.746 --> 03:01.147
any chance he gets.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.216
I won't.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.952
I will never.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.725
I will never let
this business or anyone

03:11.758 --> 03:13.526
ever change the essence
of who I am.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.129
[engine revs]

03:19.232 --> 03:22.335
(Ryan)
Like my city, I'm different now
than I was four years ago.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.204
I've learned from my mistakes.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.273
(Fredrik)
I am always changing,
I'm expanding,

03:27.307 --> 03:29.209
and I'm becoming better
every day.

03:29.242 --> 03:32.112
(Luis)
I don't work for money.
I don't have an ego.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.114
I put it aside.
It's much simpler than that.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.583
It's about integrity.

03:36.616 --> 03:41.154
It's gonna be
a real interesting year.

03:48.795 --> 03:52.265
Alberto, can you take me
to 215 Sullivan

03:52.298 --> 03:53.266
in Greenwich Village?

03:53.299 --> 03:54.401
Sure.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.102
Greenwich Village
is where it all started.

03:56.102 --> 03:59.105
It's the oldest neighborhood
in all of Manhattan.

03:59.105 --> 04:02.409
215 Sullivan is a building
that I've had for months.

04:02.442 --> 04:06.880
It's 25 units,
where I've sold 24 of them.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.181
Ding!

04:08.214 --> 04:10.884
It really is one of the biggest
accomplishments of my career.

04:10.917 --> 04:15.889
$150 million sold
in less than three months.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.691
But I'm not done.

04:17.724 --> 04:22.162
One more, the last one,
17,250,000.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.730
We took it off the market
a few weeks ago

04:23.763 --> 04:26.099
because it didn't look good
and it wasn't selling.

04:26.132 --> 04:29.069
At such a high price point,
I had to convince the developer

04:29.069 --> 04:32.839
to not only finish the unit out
but also furnish it.

04:32.872 --> 04:37.077
And today I'm seeing it
for the very first time done.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.945
Oh...

04:38.978 --> 04:41.114
my G--

04:41.147 --> 04:42.115
[gasps]

04:42.148 --> 04:46.086
Holy moly.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.788
I mean, this is incredible.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.459
The contrast of walking through
this dusty construction site--

04:52.492 --> 04:54.427
and it's like angels singing.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.097
[choral music]
- [sniffs]

04:57.097 --> 05:01.101
I am so thankful
I got them to pay for all this.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.136
- Mr. Fredrik.
- Hey, Fredrik.

05:03.169 --> 05:06.639
- I mean, guys--
- What kind of socks are those?

05:06.673 --> 05:08.475
Daniel and Raymond,
they're tough developers.

05:08.508 --> 05:09.843
Take your shoes off.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.144
Are you gonna show us
what we paid for?

05:11.177 --> 05:12.078
I wanna see where
all the checks went.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.680
Okay, come with me.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.389
What makes this particular unit
so amazing,

05:22.422 --> 05:23.890
this three-story townhouse,

05:23.923 --> 05:26.526
is that you get the services
of the bigger building--

05:26.559 --> 05:28.661
24-hour doorman, the gym,
the parking--

05:28.695 --> 05:31.231
but you're getting
your own house

05:31.264 --> 05:34.067
with your own entrance
from the street on top of that.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.070
The size, 7,000 square feet,
private elevator.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.072
Look, isn't that clever?
I-I--it was my idea.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.073
Beautiful.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.075
I mean,
I wanted all three floors,

05:42.108 --> 05:43.877
the entire thing, finished.

05:43.910 --> 05:46.413
But they wouldn't pay for that.
I'm still happy.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.848
For the first time,
I can show buyers a home

05:48.882 --> 05:50.850
that actually feels like
a real home.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.218
That was my vision.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.753
Fredrik,
I gotta tell you--

05:53.787 --> 05:55.689
we don't give you a lot
of compliments, as you know--

05:55.722 --> 05:57.123
it came out amazing.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.125
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.860
Don't you think, with everything
we did in here now,

06:00.894 --> 06:03.229
that it's worth more money?

06:03.263 --> 06:05.031
No, well, I mean--

06:05.031 --> 06:07.901
What can I say?
It's like--it's like--

06:07.934 --> 06:10.070
It--it's classic.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.238
We're priced at 2,500 a foot
right now,

06:12.272 --> 06:15.508
and a reasonable comp in
the area would be 1,800 a foot,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.410
so we're priced high,
really high.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.347
It is worth more.
It's now worth 17 1/4.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.215
- How do you know?
- What do you mean?

06:22.248 --> 06:24.184
It's a record.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.352
But how do we know
that's the right record?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.886
You gotta push, Fredrik.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.688
I don't understand where this
defeatist attitude comes in.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.590
No, no, no, no, you guys.
You don't understand.

06:30.623 --> 06:31.858
This is not the time
to slow down.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.059
This is the time to speed up
and make it happen.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.061
- I mean, I'm sweating.
- This is too big for him.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.730
- Big for me?
- Yeah.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.199
What are you talking about?
$150 million right here.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.500
I just sold it out.
What are you talking about?

06:40.533 --> 06:41.735
You're taking this
the wrong way.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.503
Listen, guys,
you know how many times

06:43.536 --> 06:44.571
I've been showing this.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.172
We couldn't get 17 1/4.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.207
We still haven't gotten it.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.441
This is the reason
why we're--

06:48.475 --> 06:50.410
why we staged it
so beautiful.

06:50.443 --> 06:53.847
Guys, listen to me,
don't raise the price on me.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.082
I'm gonna give you full ask,
with no changes, as is.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.251
- As is?
- Yeah.

06:58.284 --> 07:02.622
I'm gonna give you full ask.

07:02.655 --> 07:06.059
- Okay.
- Just get it done, okay?

07:06.092 --> 07:08.028
- Okay.
- All right.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.029
All right, take care, Fredrik.
We gotta go.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.563
- Thank you.
- We gotta go.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.203
[ding]

07:22.208 --> 07:24.411
(Luis)
Roni, I'm on my way
to 92 Laight Street.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.312
(Ronita)
Okay, great, good luck.
I hope you get it.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.814
What do you mean, "I hope"?

07:27.847 --> 07:29.816
"I know you will get it."
Positivity.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.752
Call me when you get it.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.089
92 Laight Street, it's
on the west side of Tribeca,

07:36.122 --> 07:37.557
which is one
of the quietest neighborhoods

07:37.590 --> 07:38.825
in the entire city.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.828
And it's extremely desired
by celebrities.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.064
Meryl Streep lives there.
"Gwenla" Paltrow.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.068
Gwyneth "Palshow."

07:48.068 --> 07:49.202
"Patro"?

07:49.235 --> 07:52.238
The assistant of Iron Man.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.743
Mr. Ortiz, there he is.
Thank you for coming.

07:56.776 --> 07:57.744
Morning, morning.
How are you?

07:57.777 --> 07:58.745
Angel is a referral.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.080
He's also from Puerto Rico,

08:00.113 --> 08:03.616
and this guy has made a fortune
manufacturing ballpoint pens.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.318
- I'll show you around.
- Okay, wow.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.326
Oh, wow, okay,
so you can open the windows.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.894
This is actually very rare.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.163
Buildings like 165 Charles
Street, they're only glass,

08:17.197 --> 08:18.531
so you can't really open
the windows.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.334
- And you can breathe.
- Yeah, absolutely.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.635
I like this apartment a lot.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.037
Much like the neighborhood,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.739
it's very private,
it's very quiet.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.540
The gardener that's sleeping--
look at him.

08:27.574 --> 08:30.176
- Yeah.
- With the hat.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.812
But there's an issue:
The unit itself feels

08:32.846 --> 08:33.913
a little dated.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.181
When did you buy?

08:35.215 --> 08:36.683
(Angel)
Uh, 2004.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.520
Nothing personal.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.056
It doesn't feel elegant,

08:43.056 --> 08:44.491
you know,
especially for a building

08:44.524 --> 08:46.359
that a lot of celebrities
live in.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.194
So those open as well, right?

08:48.228 --> 08:50.196
Be careful with that one.
Oh.

08:50.230 --> 08:54.567
I just broke this.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.169
I'm sorry.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.705
Uh, want to talk about price?

08:58.738 --> 08:59.906
Yes.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.208
Let's go sit down
in the living room.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.010
So tell me,
how much you pay for it?

09:04.010 --> 09:07.113
- 2.450.
- Okay, so what's your price?

09:07.147 --> 09:11.418
Well, I was thinking about 5.5,
$2,700 a square foot.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.155
That's too high.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.290
The apartment on the sixth
floor, the exact same apartment,

09:17.323 --> 09:18.825
the D-line,
exact same square footage,

09:18.858 --> 09:20.393
with the exact same room count

09:20.427 --> 09:22.896
just sold for $2,400 a foot.

09:22.929 --> 09:25.231
And for $2,700 a foot,
you can get apartments

09:25.265 --> 09:27.033
in 250 West Street.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.568
Again, it's much newer
and still smells fresh.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.037
How about 5.3?

09:31.037 --> 09:32.238
I'm thinking 5.1.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.274
- 5.1?
- Yes.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.181
All right, Luis, look,
we're both Spanish.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.050
Uh, let's do it.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.653
Um, I have to tell you
what I need to do

09:46.686 --> 09:48.688
in order to get that price.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.924
Right now,
this apartment looks like

09:50.957 --> 09:52.892
there's a family
that's been here for nine years.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.060
If we leave it exactly the way
it is,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.095
people will start looking
at the floors,

09:55.128 --> 09:56.563
they will start looking
at the dated kitchen.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.332
I need to take everything out,
and I need to stage it.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.867
Now, listen, when I'm done
with this place,

10:00.900 --> 10:04.537
it'll make the White House
look like Applebee's.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.172
So you mean
we're gonna remove this couch?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.574
Yes.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.575
Dining table?

10:08.608 --> 10:09.676
Dining table too.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.011
Everything has to go

10:11.044 --> 10:13.079
including you.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.115
Are you saying
we have to relocate?

10:15.148 --> 10:18.084
Um, yes.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.919
I'm always about learning
from past experiences,

10:19.953 --> 10:21.454
and one thing I learned
from last year is

10:21.488 --> 10:23.256
that if you're going
to get rid of the furniture,

10:23.289 --> 10:25.025
you have to get rid
of the seller too...

10:25.058 --> 10:26.226
Sorry to do this.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.227
I have to get my jacket
from the bedroom.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.862
No problem.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.930
'Cause if you don't
make them leave, they won't,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.700
and that is very bad
for potential buyers.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.468
That's a very tough thing
to ask.

10:35.502 --> 10:38.905
For him to pay for the staging
and to find a temporary place,

10:38.938 --> 10:41.408
that's gonna cost him
about $15,000 a month.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.277
I've never asked this
of any seller ever.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.379
[groans]
I don't know, Luis.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.782
You're asking me
to move out of my house.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.084
Listen,
no good things come easy.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.253
In order for me
to sell it quickly,

10:53.286 --> 10:55.855
this is the way to get it.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.559
All right.
I'm gonna take your advice.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.760
I mean,
you're the professional.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.795
- You ready?
- Yes.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.398
- 5.1 million. My man.
- 5.1.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.667
Angel and his family are going
to be in a temporary place,

11:07.701 --> 11:09.069
which means I have
to move fast.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.603
I'm really hoping
I can sell this

11:10.637 --> 11:11.771
in the next month or two.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.441
But at over 5 million,
it could be tough,

11:14.474 --> 11:15.709
so that's a lot of pressure.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.211
If this doesn't work,
I'm coming after you.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.747
Yeah, I'll let you
do that.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.086
Ronita,
cancel my next appointment.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.887
I gotta get back
to 92 Laight Street.

11:27.921 --> 11:28.955
I have to throw a party.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.357
We need to invite,
like, every broker

11:30.390 --> 11:31.391
in New York City--
everyone.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.426
Even, like--
even someone like Luis.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.112
Emilia has officially moved in,

11:52.112 --> 11:54.014
and I kind of like it.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.217
You are the perfect height
for this.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.320
Oh, yeah, so I'm meeting, um,
your friend Yvonne today.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.655
- The developer.
- Oh.

12:02.689 --> 12:07.293
Did you tell her that I'm, like,
the best broker in New York?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.528
What did you tell her
about me?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.296
Uh, that you're tall.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.631
Nice.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.733
Having a lawyer for a girlfriend
is awesome

12:13.767 --> 12:15.335
because she runs
in the same circles

12:15.368 --> 12:17.070
as the successful people
in my industry.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.371
What tie should I wear?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.740
Emilia met a developer
while she was playing tennis.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.176
It turns out that Yvonne
is really unhappy

12:23.209 --> 12:24.411
with her current broker.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.379
Yuri, we're going
to a new development

12:26.413 --> 12:30.483
at 230 East 63rd Street.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.987
The Upper East Side is known
for old money.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.190
All of the very expensive
co-ops and condos

12:37.223 --> 12:40.393
are on Park Avenue,
Madison, and 5th Avenue.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.228
But this building,
by comparison,

12:42.262 --> 12:44.197
is completely brand-new.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.200
From the ground up,
new construction.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.002
- Hello.
- Come in.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.737
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.738
Good to meet you.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.872
So Emilia told me
a lot about you.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.276
Was it--
was it good?

12:56.309 --> 12:57.344
We'll see.

12:58.878 --> 13:01.047
(Ryan)
This building has six units,

13:01.047 --> 13:03.216
only two of which were sold
by the previous broker.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.718
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.287
The third floor is being used
as the model unit,

13:07.320 --> 13:09.856
and it's nearly identical
to the fifth floor

13:09.889 --> 13:12.959
and the second floor.

13:13.059 --> 13:17.330
All three of these upper units
are 2 bedroom, 2 1/2 baths.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.198
And Yvonne has built in

13:18.231 --> 13:21.201
all these very,
very high-end amenities,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.636
which is super unique
for the neighborhood.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.905
They're all keyless entry, so
you don't have to be searching

13:25.939 --> 13:27.507
for your keys
if you have groceries.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.142
It's like the future.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.310
We tried to think
of everything.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.911
So all the units
are pretty much the same

13:31.945 --> 13:33.546
except for the first floor.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.383
The highlight of this space
is the outdoor space.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.684
This is huge.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.720
(Yvonne)
Hard to find.
And the bedroom.

13:40.754 --> 13:43.189
- Up front here.
- Okay.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.192
So the one bedroom

13:46.226 --> 13:49.362
and then
it's right on the street.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.264
Oh, there goes someone
walking by.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.832
I don't like negatives.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.101
I'm a very positive person.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.504
So this is
about 700 square feet.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.939
Okay, so this is
a great bonus space.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.875
But it's downstairs space,
this is below grade,

14:01.908 --> 14:03.643
so when they factor in pricing
per square foot,

14:03.677 --> 14:05.178
they're just gonna factor in
the upstairs.

14:05.211 --> 14:06.446
Right.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.315
(Ryan)
Because that level
is below grade,

14:09.349 --> 14:12.185
underground,
you can't count it

14:12.218 --> 14:15.221
as residential square footage
or as a legal bedroom.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.324
It's one of those weird rules
of New York City real estate.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.128
But hopefully having
this amazing patio outside

14:22.162 --> 14:24.664
can offset all these negatives,
and it could.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.233
So, new development.
When did you buy the building?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.635
Just so I have an idea
of the history.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.203
- About two years ago.
- Okay.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.908
So with those four apartments

14:34.941 --> 14:36.676
that sell out
to about $13 million...

14:36.710 --> 14:37.811
Yes.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.312
So all the pricing,
we'll leave the same.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.349
I don't think
you should reduce it at all.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.516
Look, here's the deal.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.819
Emilia told me
you're a hard worker.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.220
We think you're the right fit
for this building.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.523
If you sell these apartments
in 30 days,

14:50.557 --> 14:54.194
I would love to give them
to you.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.829
What?

14:55.862 --> 14:57.764
You want to do
a 30-day agreement

14:57.797 --> 14:59.599
for an entire building?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.101
Correct.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.871
Selling one apartment
in 30 days is tough.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.273
Four...

15:07.307 --> 15:09.109
is tough times four.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.277
But you're one
of the top brokers in the city.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.312
I--

15:12.345 --> 15:13.313
This should be
a piece of cake for you.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.481
I-I am.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.650
What I'm saying is that
30 days is tricky,

15:17.684 --> 15:19.285
but it's a challenge
that I'm up for.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.888
At just under $2,000
per square foot,

15:21.921 --> 15:24.724
these prices are
above the average for the area.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.360
But I do have some buyers
right now

15:27.394 --> 15:30.230
who I think will jump
all over those upper units.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.834
It's the bottom unit
that I'm a little worried about.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.207
Let's do it.
I like a little pressure.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.876
Okay.

15:42.909 --> 15:45.345
It's a deal.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.181
What are you gonna do
with all that money?

15:48.214 --> 15:50.417
You know, this ring
was very expensive.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.818
I can see
where your head's at.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.353
I think you make
a great couple.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.122
What are you waiting for?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.524
- The next step...
- Yeah, I understand.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.426
- I understand how things work.
- Is getting engaged.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.261
I've read--
There's a book.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.262
I don't think
you read it right.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.264
- I didn't read that book.
- No.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.766
Proposing is...

16:06.800 --> 16:09.836
it's on my to-do list.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.338
Somewhere.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.472
How about this?

16:12.505 --> 16:15.141
Why don't we continue
that conversation

16:15.175 --> 16:16.443
at the closing table?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.712
Okay.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.313
How much was that ring,
by the way?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.686
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.821
What are you doing here?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.823
I'm just picking up
my computer.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.324
What are you painting?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.393
- It's called a tree of life.
- It's beautiful.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.529
So last year,
Derek's career as an artist

16:36.563 --> 16:38.732
was just taking off.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.066
It's really beautiful.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.569
And I am so incredibly proud
of him.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.504
[line ringing]
- What are you doing?

16:44.537 --> 16:47.073
I'm planning this party.
It's very important.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.076
Okay, 215 Sullivan,

16:50.110 --> 16:51.211
I have to throw a party.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.480
We need to invite, like,
every broker in New York City,

16:53.513 --> 16:56.816
every broker--
like, everyone.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.386
Even, like--
even someone like Luis.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.291
[glass shatters]

17:05.325 --> 17:07.160
You [bleep] mother[bleep]
selfish bitch.

17:07.193 --> 17:11.131
You weak piece of [bleep].

17:11.164 --> 17:13.033
Well...

17:13.066 --> 17:15.368
I mean, every broker
in New York City will be there.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.803
Ryan is invited.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.172
Luis', you know,
friend.

17:19.205 --> 17:23.209
But now my new friend.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.381
I'm trying to sell out
a building.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.382
I gotta go.
I gotta work.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.650
Bye.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.954
Babe, why don't you
lick me like that?

17:35.055 --> 17:36.156
(Derek)
What?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.630
[musical ringtone]

17:43.663 --> 17:45.865
Mr. Angel, good morning,
good morning.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.801
Hey,<i>cómo estás, hermano?</i>
How are you?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.069
<i>Todo bien, todo bien.</i>

17:49.069 --> 17:50.637
Today's a beautiful day.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.405
Angel is moving out,
and I'm on my way

17:52.439 --> 17:54.741
to meet my designers
to talk about the staging.

17:54.774 --> 17:55.875
Talk to me.

18:08.722 --> 18:11.891
Well, the--the movers are
already moving the things out.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.628
Yes, but I pushed things
a little bit sooner

18:15.662 --> 18:18.131
so that we can start getting
all the staging in.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.600
Let's do something.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.302
Let me try to find a place
for you to stay.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.337
Please be open to the idea.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.139
Angel wants me to sell his
apartment as soon as possible,

18:26.172 --> 18:28.608
so it's very important for me
to get him out.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.543
If the seller and his family
are living in the apartment,

18:30.577 --> 18:32.278
it becomes very hard
for me to show it,

18:32.312 --> 18:35.181
especially those showings
that come in last minute.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.489
All right.

18:42.522 --> 18:46.192
Why?
This is a beautiful day.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.193
- Hey.
- Ronita?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.228
Cancel my next appointment.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.729
I gotta get back
to 92 Laight Street.

18:49.763 --> 18:51.698
I have to solve this.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.933
I just need to find a place
for him to stay.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.740
Ah, uh, guys, please stop
the move for one second, please.

19:00.774 --> 19:03.143
Can you put the boxes down?

19:03.176 --> 19:05.645
Can everybody stop the move
for one second?

19:05.679 --> 19:08.381
Jesus, you've packed
the whole place.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.924
You see Luis in the Maserati?

19:18.024 --> 19:19.459
A Maserati.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.100
Jesus, you've packed
the whole place.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.370
Uh, stop for one second,
please.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.573
(man)
Hello?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.642
Daniel, how are you?
Luis Ortiz.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.610
In the beginning of my career,
I started as a rental agent,

19:37.644 --> 19:39.312
and I'm still
very well connected

19:39.346 --> 19:41.281
with the absolute best people
in the business

19:41.314 --> 19:42.449
when it comes to rentals.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.351
Whatever's available,
they have it.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.453
I have a client
that needs an immediate move-in.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.789
Anywhere from 7,000 to 12,000,
three-bedroom.

19:49.823 --> 19:51.691
Uh, this is
sort of an emergency.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.700
In New York City, there is a bad
and good season for everything.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.971
This is not the good season
for short-term rentals.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.674
That's impossible.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.376
You're telling me
that in the city of Manhattan

20:09.409 --> 20:11.344
there's not an available
apartment short-term?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.882
I know for a fact that
my clients don't want a hotel.

20:19.853 --> 20:21.521
Adam, I want to ask you
something.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.490
You know that place
that you own in Tribeca?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.126
I know you don't live
in that place.

20:26.159 --> 20:29.362
Is there any way in the world
that you can allow me

20:29.396 --> 20:32.165
to put my tenants in there
for a month or two?

20:34.367 --> 20:35.735
I'm sort of in a bad spot.

20:35.769 --> 20:39.239
I don't like
to ask for favors.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.607
Right now, I need one.

20:49.049 --> 20:50.116
And now I'm [bleep].

20:50.150 --> 20:51.484
Oh, this is the owner.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.453
Very, very [bleep].

20:53.486 --> 20:55.288
I'm looking for a place
for you to stay.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.490
I just need about another hour,
so please hang tight for me.

21:11.338 --> 21:14.974
This is the most important
open house maybe of my career.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.177
At a $13-million sellout,

21:17.210 --> 21:18.511
it's not the biggest deal
I've ever done.

21:18.545 --> 21:22.148
I mean, I've done sellouts
that are $300 million,

21:22.182 --> 21:24.651
but Yvonne is a big developer

21:24.684 --> 21:26.986
who might have other projects
in the future.

21:27.087 --> 21:28.288
30 days, bitch.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.556
That's right,
I didn't call you a bitch.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.658
I called myself a bitch.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.892
Mm.

21:32.926 --> 21:34.828
Even though I'm showing
all units tonight...

21:34.861 --> 21:36.396
Let's go.

21:36.429 --> 21:39.299
My strategy is to stage
the party on the ground floor

21:39.332 --> 21:41.668
because this is gonna be
the toughest unit to sell.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.803
- Hi. Welcome.
- Hi.

21:43.837 --> 21:45.305
So I did multiple email blasts,

21:45.338 --> 21:48.241
and I invited every single
broker I know to show people

21:48.274 --> 21:52.245
that it's a great space with a
massive patio for entertaining.

21:52.278 --> 21:55.248
Hopefully that'll make them
ignore the fact

21:55.281 --> 21:58.852
that it's a $3-million
one-bedroom.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.288
So this is the maisonette,

22:02.322 --> 22:04.758
and this is
just over 2,700 square feet

22:04.791 --> 22:06.926
with over 500 square feet
of outdoor space.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.927
You have a bedroom there,
and then you have

22:07.961 --> 22:09.596
this amazing downstairs
bonus space.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.065
Double Sub-Zero that could
basically fit one Yolanda.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.533
This is Yolanda.
Yolanda, say hello.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.567
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:16.236 --> 22:17.537
This one is 3.1.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.606
- We love the first floor space.
- Okay.

22:19.639 --> 22:20.607
But ideally looking
for something

22:20.640 --> 22:22.142
with a little bit more
of a view.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.243
To the third floor.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.381
You have large,
large living room.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.283
The finishes are top-notch,
some of the best I've ever seen.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.686
Carrara marble,
built-in speakers.

22:32.719 --> 22:36.456
Just gonna need
a little bit more exposure.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.692
- This is the fifth floor.
- Wow.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.326
Okay, now we're talking.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.162
(Ryan)
The price on this one is 3.3.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.364
Take a photo of the view,
send it to your guy,

22:44.397 --> 22:45.732
and let me know.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.233
That should work. That should
work. That should work.

22:47.267 --> 22:50.437
All right, let's go.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.671
This is fantastic.

22:51.705 --> 22:54.641
You know, I think
I actually have a buyer for you.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.409
- For this one?
- For the third floor.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.277
- Third floor?
- Yes.

22:57.310 --> 23:00.113
Okay, so the asking price on it
is 3.25.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.349
- Tell them to get on it.
- Okay.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.352
What's crazy to me is that
another broker had this building

23:05.385 --> 23:06.820
and they couldn't sell it.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.755
So I've got a buyer
for the third floor.

23:08.788 --> 23:09.756
- Third floor?
- Yeah.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.291
Everybody wants
the third floor.

23:11.324 --> 23:13.827
And yet I do one open house,
and I've got, like,

23:13.860 --> 23:15.795
insane interest.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.864
I think I'm awesome.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.266
- The third floor is beautiful.
- Yeah, I think it's great.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.935
I'm not surprised that
the upper units

23:21.968 --> 23:24.437
are getting the most interest
tonight.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.172
But that just means
that I have to work extra hard

23:26.206 --> 23:27.474
to sell the lower unit.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.709
We're only asking--
asking actually, like,

23:29.743 --> 23:31.378
a little bit less
than the other units

23:31.411 --> 23:33.213
that don't have
all that outdoor space.

23:33.246 --> 23:36.683
I mean, but, you know,
people can see us right now.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.119
I mean, if you guys are,
you know, antisocial,

23:39.152 --> 23:42.489
then I guess being able to--
hello.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.091
- I mean, exactly, right there.
- Yeah.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.326
Yeah.

23:46.359 --> 23:49.429
That's why God invented
window treatments.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.431
And then this is
the downstairs space.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.099
And this is huge.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.235
So you're getting
almost 600 square feet more

23:55.268 --> 23:57.003
of interior space
for the same amount

23:57.103 --> 23:58.538
plus all that outdoor space.

24:01.374 --> 24:02.342
Yeah.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.843
Just ideally,

24:03.877 --> 24:07.080
I feel like I would need more
than just one bedroom upstairs.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.581
Yeah.
Okay.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.616
I mean,
I'll take you up to see

24:09.649 --> 24:11.451
some of the other units
upstairs then.

24:11.484 --> 24:12.585
I always knew
the ground floor

24:12.619 --> 24:14.254
would be the toughest one
to sell.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.588
But I only have
three weeks here,

24:15.622 --> 24:16.856
and I have to figure out
a way to sell

24:16.890 --> 24:18.358
all four of the apartments.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.669
What do you want me to do
with the movers?

24:33.506 --> 24:34.541
Okay.

24:41.081 --> 24:44.718
All right, guys, um,
let's unwrap everything.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.686
I'm sorry.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.159
[phone rings]

24:53.193 --> 24:54.361
Hello, this is Luis.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.701
I am.

25:09.442 --> 25:11.044
It'll mean a lot to me, man.

25:19.119 --> 25:21.287
One or two months.
Thank you so much, Adam.

25:21.321 --> 25:22.956
And I'll call you back.
I just need to speak to him.

25:23.056 --> 25:26.259
Yes!
I found a place.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.461
Angel,
I found you a phenomenal place

25:28.495 --> 25:29.796
in Tribeca.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.332
But I need to convince Angel
to take it.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.167
Beautiful apartment,
fully furnished,

25:34.200 --> 25:35.635
and it's immaculate.

25:35.669 --> 25:37.437
I just need you to--
I just need you to trust me

25:37.470 --> 25:39.706
on this one.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.541
Let's move out this stuff.

25:50.183 --> 25:53.787
Yes!
[laughing]

25:53.820 --> 25:55.822
Oh, it feels amazing.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.090
All right, guys,
don't kill me,

25:57.123 --> 25:58.658
but let's get
everything out.

25:58.692 --> 26:01.027
I was hoping to sell this
apartment in one month or two,

26:01.027 --> 26:02.796
but now I have to sell it
yesterday,

26:02.829 --> 26:05.598
not just for Angel
but for Adam too.

26:15.442 --> 26:17.243
- Babe.
- Yeah?

26:17.277 --> 26:20.046
When I post pictures of Mousey
and Fritzy on Instagram...

26:20.046 --> 26:22.048
- Uh-huh.
- I always get the most likes.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.450
(Fredrik)
Later this afternoon,
it's gonna be

26:23.483 --> 26:26.152
all about the open house that
I'm throwing at 215 Sullivan.

26:26.186 --> 26:28.455
10,000 likes
of this picture of Mousey.

26:28.488 --> 26:30.190
(Fredrik)
But this morning,

26:30.223 --> 26:31.424
it's about our house.

26:31.458 --> 26:33.693
So she's the most popular,
then he is,

26:33.727 --> 26:35.462
and then you
when you have your shirt off.

26:35.495 --> 26:37.097
[laughs]

26:37.130 --> 26:38.865
(Fredrik)
Because of Derek's career
as an artist,

26:38.898 --> 26:41.301
we've put having a child
on the back burner.

26:41.334 --> 26:44.971
And although that's a little bit
difficult for me to adjust to,

26:45.071 --> 26:46.206
we're gonna put all our effort

26:46.239 --> 26:48.274
into the two children
we already have.

26:48.308 --> 26:50.744
Okay, so I have an idea.
I want to break 20,000 likes.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.312
Hold them there.

26:52.345 --> 26:54.381
Fritzy, stay there.

26:54.414 --> 26:55.749
I think we should dress them
like--

26:55.782 --> 26:58.084
we should have a theme, like...

26:58.118 --> 26:59.786
You know, I always buy
all these clothes for them,

26:59.819 --> 27:01.721
but they never--we never
dressed them up in it.

27:01.755 --> 27:05.258
Look how happy she is.
She loves it.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.260
Good girl, Mousey.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.895
- Look how handsome you look.
- We'll get it.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.296
[dog whines]

27:12.032 --> 27:14.034
Oh, Fritzy.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.304
(Fredrik)
Okay, wait, let me post it.

27:18.338 --> 27:19.472
[gasps]
Babe.

27:19.506 --> 27:21.241
We already have
our first like.

27:21.274 --> 27:22.308
Oh, another one.

27:22.342 --> 27:24.244
Another like.

27:24.277 --> 27:27.847
(Fredrik)
I hope 215 is going to be
as popular as you two.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.086
[line rings]

27:33.119 --> 27:34.087
(Yvonne)
Hello?

27:34.120 --> 27:35.689
Hey, Yvonne, it's Ryan.

27:37.457 --> 27:38.591
I'm good.

27:38.625 --> 27:39.793
Thanks to my open house,

27:39.826 --> 27:44.431
I've got you
two full-price cash offers

27:44.464 --> 27:47.467
for the third floor
and the fifth floor.

27:51.271 --> 27:54.074
I mean, you don't have to accept
them if you don't want to.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.275
I mean, it's up to you.
I don't know.

27:55.308 --> 27:56.943
You tell me.

28:00.013 --> 28:01.214
Okay, good.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.282
So, awesome.

28:02.315 --> 28:04.284
So we've sold two.

28:04.317 --> 28:06.252
So while I've got you
in a really good mood,

28:06.286 --> 28:10.256
the other two are
a little tricky.

28:10.290 --> 28:12.125
(Ryan)
I knew the ground floor
was gonna be tough.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.427
But I also got a lot of pushback
on the second floor,

28:14.461 --> 28:15.929
because it doesn't have
the same views

28:16.029 --> 28:18.264
as the third and fifth floor do.

28:18.298 --> 28:21.768
So, I mean, we might need
to talk about pricing.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.937
I don't like
asking for price reductions,

28:24.037 --> 28:26.339
but out of the 200 brokers
that showed up,

28:26.373 --> 28:31.277
not one of them expressed
interest in the lower two units.

28:31.311 --> 28:32.712
And that's a problem.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.392
She keeps telling me
how great I am.

28:47.427 --> 28:49.362
I think she's playing
mind games on me,

28:49.396 --> 28:52.399
which is what I do to people.

28:52.432 --> 28:53.800
And it's working.

28:56.469 --> 28:58.304
Yes, we can.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.908
Okay, thank you.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.584
(Fredrik)
These chairs are not aligned.

29:11.618 --> 29:12.819
This has to be perfect.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.220
[blowing]

29:14.254 --> 29:15.321
I have a lot of pressure here.

29:15.355 --> 29:17.557
I have the most expensive unit
in the building to sell.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.325
280 people are coming.

29:19.359 --> 29:22.295
But this is the hottest building
in New York City right now,

29:22.328 --> 29:24.497
and I am the broker.

29:26.499 --> 29:27.500
[doorbell rings]

29:27.534 --> 29:29.035

shoes off, shoes off.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.037

29:31.037 --> 29:32.105
Shoes off.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.106
Mwah.
How are you?

29:33.139 --> 29:34.908
Oh, shoes, shoes.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.509
(Fredrik)
Just keep your underwear on.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.915
So it's 7,000 square feet
inside.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.184
2,000 square feet of garden.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.318
It has six-bedrooms,

29:45.352 --> 29:48.321
six full baths, private
elevator, private parking.

29:48.355 --> 29:50.457
I'll take a group down,
and the rest,

29:50.490 --> 29:53.793
you stay up here and look at
the beautiful finishes, okay?

29:53.827 --> 29:57.197
Okay, so we're still
in this triplex townhouse.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.199
Down here,
very messy, very dirty.

29:59.232 --> 30:01.101
But you still get
the proportions.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.636
These are kids' bedrooms,
right here.

30:03.670 --> 30:05.338
I mean, it's gorgeous,
isn't it?

30:05.372 --> 30:06.373
Okay, guys.

30:06.406 --> 30:07.474
Let's go upstairs
and have a party

30:07.507 --> 30:08.641
where there's no dust.

30:08.675 --> 30:10.810
Music.
Champagne!

30:13.380 --> 30:14.481
[laughter]

30:14.514 --> 30:16.449
What's so funny?
Do you have a buyer?

30:16.483 --> 30:18.018
I mean, this is so insane.
There's, like--

30:18.051 --> 30:19.486
You can't even move in here.

30:19.519 --> 30:20.520
It's packed.

30:24.257 --> 30:26.126
So this is your 2,000
square feet of garden.

30:26.159 --> 30:28.061
Private garden.
Outdoor kitchen.

30:28.094 --> 30:30.063
You know
what it's missing?

30:30.096 --> 30:31.297
No.
Nothing.

30:31.331 --> 30:33.667
Can we put a pool in?

30:33.700 --> 30:35.201
Well, you see,
it's a new development,

30:35.235 --> 30:36.636
so I appreciate your changes.

30:36.670 --> 30:37.637
I'm gonna tell you
one other thing.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.472
All right.

30:39.506 --> 30:42.142
This bedroom, I think,
is a little too small.

30:42.175 --> 30:44.144
I want to blow it out.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.812
Um...right.

30:45.845 --> 30:50.550
I promised Daniel and Raymond
to sell this as is, no changes.

30:52.552 --> 30:54.688
But in real estate,
everything is baby steps.

30:54.721 --> 30:56.322
First, getting the offer.

30:56.356 --> 30:57.457
You have the right
to want whatever you want.

30:57.490 --> 30:58.458
You're the buyer.

30:58.491 --> 30:59.359
I mean, are you the buyer?

30:59.392 --> 31:01.061
I could be.

31:01.061 --> 31:02.495
I like your style.

31:02.529 --> 31:04.330
Let's continue
this discussion.

31:08.802 --> 31:10.870
(Ryan)
If Fredrik and I
are gonna work together,

31:10.904 --> 31:14.374
then I'm gonna support him
and go to one of his open houses

31:14.407 --> 31:17.344
and not take my clothes off.

31:19.679 --> 31:21.381
Oh, my God.

31:21.414 --> 31:22.382
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

31:22.415 --> 31:23.383
Good to see you.

31:23.416 --> 31:24.384
You didn't take your shoes off?

31:24.417 --> 31:26.319
No one told me
to take my shoes off.

31:26.353 --> 31:28.621
I can't do anything right
for this guy.

31:28.655 --> 31:30.290
Thanks for coming, by the way.
I really appreciate it.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.291
For sure.

31:31.324 --> 31:33.360
[engine revving]

31:38.598 --> 31:41.301
You see Luis
in the Maserati?

31:41.334 --> 31:43.737
(Fredrik)
A Maserati.

31:43.770 --> 31:47.340
I had that phase too,
but then, you know, I grew up.

31:47.374 --> 31:48.375
[car honks]

31:50.343 --> 31:51.745
Maybe I need
to come work for you.

31:51.778 --> 31:53.513
- Maybe.
- You are rich.

31:53.546 --> 31:54.848
You know what I have?

31:54.881 --> 31:57.384
I need someone to
clean my shoes in the morning.

31:58.852 --> 32:00.053
Wow.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.462
You see Luis
in the Maserati?

32:09.496 --> 32:11.064
That's why he doesn't
pick up his phone.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.399
He's Maserati shopping.

32:12.432 --> 32:14.467
You were saying something
like that at the breakfast.

32:14.501 --> 32:15.669
When I first got
into the business,

32:15.702 --> 32:16.670
I remember my boss--

32:16.703 --> 32:19.406
I remember Eddie telling me
stay humble.

32:19.439 --> 32:20.740
You know,
you do one big deal,

32:20.774 --> 32:23.610
and you think
you're the king of Richistan.

32:23.643 --> 32:24.644
I don't know,
maybe he doesn't have

32:24.678 --> 32:25.645
someone guiding him.

32:25.679 --> 32:26.646
I really don't know.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.416
I tried to guide, and...

32:29.449 --> 32:30.550
that went like that.

32:34.087 --> 32:36.623
I'm coming to Fredrik's open
house because despite our past,

32:36.656 --> 32:37.991
Fredrik understands
that I have become

32:38.091 --> 32:40.460
one of the top brokers
in the city.

32:40.493 --> 32:41.795
- Look at this man.
- You know each other?

32:41.828 --> 32:43.096
Yes, of course
we know each other.

32:43.096 --> 32:44.497
How are you, man?
Good to see you.

32:51.338 --> 32:52.605
So...

32:52.639 --> 32:53.606
What is this?
Are you guys--

32:53.640 --> 32:54.874
I thought
you guys hated each other.

32:54.908 --> 32:56.142
Working together?

32:56.176 --> 32:57.610
Maybe we are.

33:00.447 --> 33:02.315
You look like
a cute couple.

33:02.349 --> 33:04.551
Of course these two would have
eventually worked together.

33:04.584 --> 33:05.452
Perfect combination:

33:05.485 --> 33:07.087
the guy that pours drinks
over people

33:07.120 --> 33:09.289
and the guy that shoves pocket
squares down people's throats.

33:09.322 --> 33:10.457
I love the car.

33:10.490 --> 33:11.458
Is that really yours?

33:11.491 --> 33:12.659
- Yes.
- Did you buy that?

33:12.692 --> 33:13.660
Yes.

33:13.693 --> 33:15.428
How expensive is that?

33:15.462 --> 33:17.497
I got a Maserati.
So what?

33:17.530 --> 33:19.466
I have worked very hard
this year,

33:19.499 --> 33:22.168
and I am very, very proud
of what I'm accomplishing.

33:22.202 --> 33:24.504
All of this stuff
is unnecessary.

33:24.537 --> 33:25.638
That's why I don't
return these guys' calls.

33:25.672 --> 33:27.507
Too negative, you know?

33:27.540 --> 33:28.808
Maybe I need
to come work for you.

33:28.842 --> 33:30.243
- Maybe.
- You are rich.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.745
I think you'd do great.
You know what I have?

33:31.778 --> 33:34.781
I need someone to
clean my shoes in the morning.

33:37.650 --> 33:38.418
Wow.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.086
I think
a little attitude's fine.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.522
No one hates Justin Bieber
for having an attitude.

33:42.555 --> 33:45.392
Oh, wait.

33:45.425 --> 33:46.960
It's just weird that
you guys are working together.

33:46.993 --> 33:48.361
- I mean, that--
- Why is it weird?

33:48.395 --> 33:49.462
(Fredrik)
I mean,
you didn't put your ego aside.

33:49.496 --> 33:52.465
You couldn't do that,
but he--we have.

33:52.499 --> 33:53.733
Are you trying
to rub it in my face

33:53.767 --> 33:55.568
that you're working with him?
I don't mind it's him.

33:55.602 --> 33:56.736
(Fredrik)
I'm not rubbing anything
in your face.

33:56.770 --> 33:59.472
I tried to rub a Park Slope
building in your face.

33:59.506 --> 34:00.473
You did not want my help.

34:00.507 --> 34:02.742
You said, like,
really crazy things.

34:02.776 --> 34:04.444
I don't understand.
I'm trying to help you.

34:04.477 --> 34:05.412
You're not trying to help me.

34:05.445 --> 34:08.281
You want to control me.

34:08.314 --> 34:10.417
That's actually
being very soft

34:10.450 --> 34:14.554
compared to what I thought,
and still think, you deserve.

34:14.587 --> 34:16.456
Okay.

34:19.492 --> 34:22.962
Yeah.
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

34:23.063 --> 34:24.898
I think
Luis has a bunch of issues.

34:24.931 --> 34:26.466
Maybe you were right
about him.

34:26.499 --> 34:28.935
(Fredrik)
He's not gonna let anyone
change him.

34:28.968 --> 34:30.470
Do your own thing.
Obviously, you're alone.

34:30.503 --> 34:31.471
Do it.

34:31.504 --> 34:33.340
Anyway, I gotta do some selling.

34:33.373 --> 34:35.108
Sure, I'm gonna run around
and steal all your clients.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.109
Is that okay?

34:36.142 --> 34:37.110
Just kidding, just kidding.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.645
Remember?
Old times.

34:45.885 --> 34:47.354
(Ryan)
So this is the building.

34:47.387 --> 34:49.622
What we're having issues with is
this one right here

34:49.656 --> 34:51.358
and then
the second-floor apartment.

34:51.391 --> 34:54.561
After my phone call with Yvonne,
I reached out to everyone

34:54.594 --> 34:56.529
who attended the open house
at 63rd Street,

34:56.563 --> 35:00.400
and no one is showing interest
in the bottom two units.

35:00.433 --> 35:05.271
So it is time for me
to get creative.

35:05.305 --> 35:06.406
All right.

35:06.439 --> 35:08.708
So this is the first floor.

35:08.742 --> 35:10.543
Great outdoor space.

35:10.577 --> 35:11.745
Andres Escobar's designed

35:11.778 --> 35:14.481
some of the most beautiful
new condominium buildings,

35:14.514 --> 35:18.118
as well as some of the most
high-end residential homes.

35:18.151 --> 35:19.719
I mean, you can literally
turn the stove on, like,

35:19.753 --> 35:21.421
from the lobby.

35:21.454 --> 35:22.555
And that's not cool.

35:22.589 --> 35:25.091
So to take this kitchen

35:25.125 --> 35:26.459
and, like, pick it up,

35:26.493 --> 35:29.162
and we move it down here.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.798
Instead of having two apartments
that'd each have drawbacks,

35:31.831 --> 35:35.568
why not give purchasers the
option of combining both of them

35:35.602 --> 35:37.771
and then having something
that's potentially perfect?

35:37.804 --> 35:40.073
(Ryan)
I think we make this
the family room.

35:40.073 --> 35:41.074
Mm.

35:47.814 --> 35:49.416
Okay.

35:49.449 --> 35:51.351
(Ryan)
Andres Escobar is known
all over the world.

35:51.384 --> 35:54.754
And when
Andres Escobar's soul talks,

35:54.788 --> 35:57.524
you listen.

35:57.557 --> 35:58.458
(Ryan)
So I don't know.

35:58.491 --> 36:00.427
What if we moved the kitchen
right there?

36:00.460 --> 36:02.529
Bam.
That way, you walk in,

36:02.562 --> 36:04.364
maybe that's
a nice entry foyer space.

36:04.397 --> 36:06.466
Turn this into, like,
a cool wet bar.

36:06.499 --> 36:08.435
You have a nice, big,
open kitchen that leads

36:08.468 --> 36:10.303
to your crazy outdoor space.

36:10.337 --> 36:12.305
And then maybe the stairs
go up here somehow.

36:12.339 --> 36:13.373
You could probably do that.

36:13.406 --> 36:15.041
And then you go upstairs
to go to bed.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.943
And then downstairs is
the living quarters.

36:17.043 --> 36:18.778
And then I sell both of them
in one shot.

36:18.812 --> 36:20.046
Bam.
Then I'm done.

36:26.119 --> 36:28.088
I think that's a great idea.

36:28.121 --> 36:30.657
- You think so?
- Sure.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.392
Yes.

36:32.425 --> 36:35.061
So how much is this
gonna cost?

36:35.095 --> 36:36.663
I think that you could do
this kind of work

36:36.696 --> 36:39.699
around the $250,000 range.

36:39.733 --> 36:40.700
250?

36:40.734 --> 36:42.402
Yes.

36:42.435 --> 36:43.436
[exhales]

36:43.470 --> 36:44.771
This is the best
I've felt all day.

36:44.804 --> 36:46.606
The price
is reasonable enough,

36:46.639 --> 36:48.375
and if I draw up
some floor plans,

36:48.408 --> 36:51.544
I think I can get Yvonne
to go along with this.

36:51.578 --> 36:54.714
But first, I have to talk
to some $6-million buyers

36:54.748 --> 36:56.449
and see if they're interested.

36:56.483 --> 36:57.484
You're the man.

37:03.590 --> 37:05.759
(Ronita)
I set up two open houses
for 92 Laight Street.

37:05.792 --> 37:06.760
Okay.

37:06.793 --> 37:07.761
Are you paying attention to me?

37:07.794 --> 37:08.762
Of course.
Continue.

37:08.795 --> 37:09.763
What are you doing?

37:09.796 --> 37:11.431
I'm...
Stop.

37:11.464 --> 37:12.532
Next listing.

37:12.565 --> 37:15.635
Okay, I am gonna be
calling this seller.

37:15.669 --> 37:17.237
You're on Tinder.

37:17.270 --> 37:18.405
Yeah.

37:18.438 --> 37:20.707
Why are you on Tinder?

37:20.740 --> 37:22.575
Um...

37:22.609 --> 37:24.044
The last time
I was in a real relationship

37:24.044 --> 37:25.812
was almost five years ago.

37:25.845 --> 37:28.415
I've realized that maybe
I've been missing on something

37:28.448 --> 37:29.449
that I would enjoy.

37:29.482 --> 37:30.750
Listen, it's entertaining.
Come here.

37:30.784 --> 37:32.385
It's not entertaining.

37:32.419 --> 37:33.920
(Luis)
I'm a very busy man, okay?

37:33.953 --> 37:36.756
And, you know,
Tinder is straight to the point.

37:36.790 --> 37:38.725
- It puts every person--
- No, it doesn't.

37:38.758 --> 37:40.226
Every female person
that's in your radio--

37:40.260 --> 37:41.394
In your radio?

37:41.428 --> 37:42.395
Is that not
how you say this?

37:42.429 --> 37:43.763
[laughs]
Radius.

37:43.797 --> 37:44.831
Whatever.
You know what I mean.

37:44.864 --> 37:46.066
Now, check this out.

37:46.066 --> 37:47.100
So you see this girl?

37:47.133 --> 37:48.101
No.

37:48.134 --> 37:49.536
What about her?

37:49.569 --> 37:51.504
Her.
[laughs]

37:51.538 --> 37:53.873
This is not the way
to meet a girlfriend.

37:53.907 --> 37:55.508
Are you going to introduce me
to someone, Ronita?

37:55.542 --> 37:57.377
If she likes you
and you like her back,

37:57.410 --> 37:58.445
it puts you
in a text message.

37:58.478 --> 37:59.546
You're right next door,
it says,

37:59.579 --> 38:00.547
"I'm going next door
to have a coffee.

38:00.580 --> 38:01.781
You want to join me?"
"Yes, of course."

38:01.815 --> 38:04.617
Nobody goes and has coffee
off of Tinder.

38:04.651 --> 38:05.618
Don't go on Tinder.

38:05.652 --> 38:08.021
Don't worry.

38:08.054 --> 38:09.889
Now talk to me
about Laight Street.

38:18.732 --> 38:20.066
Thank you.

38:22.035 --> 38:23.370
I got a call from a buyer

38:23.403 --> 38:25.438
that came to my open house
at Sullivan,

38:25.472 --> 38:27.807
and I got an offer.

38:27.841 --> 38:28.875
Morning, Fredrik.
How are you?

38:28.908 --> 38:30.110
- Good morning.
- Nice to see you.

38:30.143 --> 38:34.114
But the one thing
I was afraid of,

38:34.147 --> 38:35.548
of course, happened.

38:35.582 --> 38:37.450
So I have an offer.

38:37.484 --> 38:40.653
$16,250,000

38:40.687 --> 38:43.056
with a couple of minor tweaks.

38:43.089 --> 38:44.057
Let's call them that.

38:44.090 --> 38:45.825
Define "tweaks."

38:45.859 --> 38:49.195
He wants to blow out the master
to make it bigger.

38:49.229 --> 38:52.866
He wants to blow out the kitchen
and add a swimming pool.

38:58.071 --> 39:00.840
No, no, and no.

39:00.874 --> 39:02.575
And you're off $1 million.

39:02.609 --> 39:04.010
So end of meeting, Raymond.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.345
Wait, wait, wait.
We gotta counter.

39:05.378 --> 39:06.446
(Daniel)
I just want to leave.
I'm gonna leave.

39:06.479 --> 39:07.447
Raymond, let's go.
I want to go.

39:07.480 --> 39:08.448
(Fredrik)
No, calm down.

39:08.481 --> 39:09.449
Just call me.
We got bad news.

39:09.482 --> 39:10.350
(Fredrik)
This is not bad news.

39:10.383 --> 39:11.551
We're gonna get him up
somewhere.

39:11.584 --> 39:13.420
I just want to hear
your thoughts on this.

39:13.453 --> 39:15.422
Have you asked us
to counter any of the units?

39:15.455 --> 39:16.589
(Fredrik)
This is different, guys.

39:16.623 --> 39:18.191
This is the biggest one,
the most expensive.

39:18.224 --> 39:19.392
You gotta give me
something to work with.

39:19.426 --> 39:21.695
Fredrik, let me just make it
very simple.

39:21.728 --> 39:23.063
(Daniel)
You have to finish strong.

39:23.096 --> 39:24.898
No high kicks.
No we.

39:24.931 --> 39:27.133
So go out there.
Go get it done.

39:27.167 --> 39:28.601
Do you understand now?

39:33.073 --> 39:34.574
You gotta come to full ask.

39:34.607 --> 39:35.575
No, no, no.

39:35.608 --> 39:36.776
Full ask.

39:36.810 --> 39:38.311
That's the only thing we can do.

39:38.345 --> 39:40.046
Please, just listen to me.

39:40.046 --> 39:42.082
I do have an idea.

39:42.115 --> 39:43.583
I'm not doing it.

39:43.616 --> 39:44.617
I'm done.

39:52.592 --> 39:53.660
All right,
so let's do something.

39:53.693 --> 39:55.362
Where are the index cards
that I asked you for?

39:55.395 --> 39:57.063
I don't have index cards.
I have Post-Its.

39:57.063 --> 39:58.198
Eh...

39:58.231 --> 39:59.232
Post-Its don't work.

39:59.265 --> 40:00.233
It's the same thing.

40:00.266 --> 40:01.401
It's not the same thing.

40:01.434 --> 40:02.502
I like to see
something that's big.

40:02.535 --> 40:04.871
Like, if you have a wall
full of...full of index cards,

40:04.904 --> 40:06.539
and they all have different
colors, you can come here,

40:06.573 --> 40:07.540
you can sit down
in front of you,

40:07.574 --> 40:08.575
and you can see
all the index cards,

40:08.608 --> 40:09.576
and you can see
all the listings,

40:09.609 --> 40:10.744
one by one in colors.

40:10.777 --> 40:12.579
Everything is there:
My whole life

40:12.612 --> 40:14.681
for showing open houses,
brokers, open houses,

40:14.714 --> 40:16.549
and then we look here, boom,
and then we have the buyers.

40:17.751 --> 40:21.054
[Luis gulps]

40:21.087 --> 40:22.055
(Ronita)
Stop drinking those.

40:22.088 --> 40:23.757
Uh...these are
very good for you.

40:23.790 --> 40:24.758
Drink my water.

40:24.791 --> 40:26.226
Boring.

40:30.630 --> 40:31.831
All right.

40:34.668 --> 40:35.835
I'll drink water.

40:35.869 --> 40:36.870
[laughs]

40:44.544 --> 40:46.379
$16,250,000.

40:47.747 --> 40:49.716
(Daniel)
You have to finish strong.

40:49.749 --> 40:51.618
No high kicks.
No we.

40:51.651 --> 40:53.553
So go out there.
Go get it done.

40:53.586 --> 40:54.754
Do you understand now?

40:57.824 --> 40:59.426
(Fredrik)
I don't even know what to do.
I look at him.

40:59.459 --> 41:01.294
He's like an angry face.
I look at him.

41:01.327 --> 41:04.064
He's like a really angry face.

41:04.064 --> 41:05.065
But I'm gonna fight it.

41:05.065 --> 41:06.199
Stay here.
Don't leave.

41:06.232 --> 41:07.200
Don't leave.
Don't go anywhere.

41:07.233 --> 41:08.935
Don't tell me what to do.

41:08.968 --> 41:10.603
[sighs]

41:10.637 --> 41:12.405
Didn't bring his A game today,
obviously.

41:12.439 --> 41:14.074
Yes, hi.
It's me.

41:14.107 --> 41:17.977
I have just done you
the biggest favor of your life.

41:18.078 --> 41:19.546
My seller, the developer,

41:19.579 --> 41:21.748
was actually gonna stand up
and walk out.

41:21.781 --> 41:22.749
Decaf?

41:22.782 --> 41:24.517
Yeah, maybe a decaf cappuccino.

41:24.551 --> 41:25.685
You gotta come to full ask.

41:25.719 --> 41:27.220
I think, I think, I hope

41:27.253 --> 41:28.588
I can make it work
with the changes.

41:28.621 --> 41:30.090
At least some of the changes.
I don't know.

41:30.090 --> 41:31.257
But you've gotta
come to full ask.

41:31.291 --> 41:32.492
I told you this
when you put in the offer.

41:32.525 --> 41:33.727
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.563
(Fredrik)
No, no, no. Full ask.

41:36.596 --> 41:37.697
That's the only thing we can do.

41:37.731 --> 41:39.466
Please, just listen to me.

41:42.402 --> 41:44.704
Here we go.

41:44.738 --> 41:46.706
Oh, my God,
it must be so amazing for you

41:46.740 --> 41:50.343
to be so close
to a 100% sellout.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.511
I mean,
it feels really good for me.

41:51.544 --> 41:52.612
Just get to the facts.

41:52.645 --> 41:54.547
I got him up.

41:54.581 --> 41:56.716
17 and 1/4

41:56.750 --> 41:59.919
with the changes.

41:59.953 --> 42:00.920
What are you talking about?

42:00.954 --> 42:02.389
He says he wants changes.

42:02.422 --> 42:04.224
I'm just the guy in the middle
trying to help you both.

42:04.257 --> 42:05.792
[coughs]

42:05.825 --> 42:07.560
Sorry, I'm allergic to BS.

42:07.594 --> 42:09.796
(Raymond)
We haven't changed
a thing in this project.

42:09.829 --> 42:12.065
People bought each
and every unit without a change.

42:12.065 --> 42:13.633
You want to sell out.
I want to sell out.

42:13.667 --> 42:16.269
I got him to full ask.

42:16.302 --> 42:18.905
Can you work with him
on any of these changes?

42:25.245 --> 42:27.080
This pool, I don't want
to even contemplate.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.581
- Okay, the pool's out.
- I don't even know how

42:28.615 --> 42:30.984
you could even bring that
into your realm or stratosphere.

42:31.084 --> 42:32.485
I have to give you all offers.

42:32.519 --> 42:33.887
So pool is out, fine.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.555
But I don't think it's
that crazy that somebody wants

42:35.588 --> 42:38.892
to open some walls
in a master and a kitchen.

42:38.925 --> 42:40.160
It won't delay the project.

42:40.193 --> 42:41.561
It's not that bad.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.602
(Daniel)
Go do your thing and sell it.

42:49.636 --> 42:52.906
They can work with the kitchen
and the master

42:52.939 --> 42:56.743
but no swimming pool.

42:56.776 --> 42:59.012
This is New York.

42:59.112 --> 43:00.880
Like, eight months of the year,
you can't even use the pool.

43:00.914 --> 43:02.382
It's gonna be ice in that pool.

43:02.415 --> 43:03.583
Join a gym.

43:03.616 --> 43:06.252
Just leave the pool behind.

43:06.286 --> 43:07.587
Please.

43:16.896 --> 43:17.897
[sighs]

43:21.167 --> 43:24.671
So, um,
17 and 1/4

43:24.704 --> 43:25.672
and the pool...

43:25.705 --> 43:27.173
[slicing]

43:27.207 --> 43:28.208
No.

43:31.578 --> 43:32.545
Great.

43:32.579 --> 43:33.747
Good job, Fredrik.

43:33.780 --> 43:35.415
You got it done.

43:35.448 --> 43:37.684
Yes!

43:37.717 --> 43:38.685
I mean, yes.

43:38.718 --> 43:40.320
Good job, Fredrik.

43:40.353 --> 43:41.688
(Fredrik)
You need to high kick now.

43:41.721 --> 43:42.689
(both)
Are you serious?

43:42.722 --> 43:43.890
17.25 million, come on.

43:43.923 --> 43:44.891
All right.

43:44.924 --> 43:47.527
Show socks.
Dinosaur arms.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.329
- Whee!
- Wha!

43:49.362 --> 43:50.497
[laughter]

43:50.530 --> 43:51.531
You're out of your mind.

43:51.564 --> 43:53.133
[laughter]

44:00.040 --> 44:01.107
(Ryan)
Can you get that?

44:01.141 --> 44:02.509
Actually, it went
all the way over there.

44:02.542 --> 44:04.577
Living with Emilia
has been awesome.

44:04.611 --> 44:05.612
[laughs]

44:05.645 --> 44:06.613
(Ryan)
I mean, I used to be the guy

44:06.646 --> 44:08.515
who would work all day

44:08.548 --> 44:10.050
and go out every night,

44:10.083 --> 44:12.719
just looking for danger.

44:12.752 --> 44:14.087
Ow, ow.

44:14.120 --> 44:16.923
And now,
now I like to stay home.

44:19.259 --> 44:20.627
I feel very shiny.

44:20.660 --> 44:23.396
My skin has gotten
a lot better too.

44:23.430 --> 44:24.831
You're missing parts
right there.

44:24.864 --> 44:25.965
Under there.

44:26.066 --> 44:27.567
I'm getting there.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.203
(Ryan)
Of course,
now that we are living together,

44:30.236 --> 44:33.707
everyone seems so anxious for us
to take the next step.

44:33.740 --> 44:35.075
I think you make a great couple.

44:35.075 --> 44:37.077
What are you waiting for?

44:37.077 --> 44:38.712
(Ryan)
I hate to disappoint Yvonne,

44:38.745 --> 44:42.749
but things feel right
just the way they are.

44:42.782 --> 44:43.850
Don't do that.

44:43.883 --> 44:45.685
[laughs]

44:47.253 --> 44:49.656
Do you want
to take advantage of me?

44:49.689 --> 44:50.590
No.

44:50.623 --> 44:51.858
I'm wooing you right now.

44:51.891 --> 44:53.093
Woo.

44:53.126 --> 44:54.427
That doesn't work that way.

44:54.461 --> 44:56.496
It does work that way.

44:56.529 --> 44:57.831
[sniffs]
This actually really smells.

44:57.864 --> 44:59.599
I just noticed that.

44:59.632 --> 45:00.667
I don't like this anymore.

45:00.700 --> 45:01.701
[laughs]

45:09.442 --> 45:10.677
Good morning, good morning.

45:10.710 --> 45:11.911
I'm meeting
with my stager, Daniela,

45:11.945 --> 45:13.046
at her warehouse in Brooklyn

45:13.079 --> 45:14.547
to talk about what kind of magic

45:14.581 --> 45:16.216
are we going to do
with 92 Laight Street.

45:16.249 --> 45:17.684
Now, 92 Laight Street's
a three-bedroom.

45:17.717 --> 45:19.285
It's very peaceful;
it's, like,

45:19.319 --> 45:21.588
on the living room
you can see the entire water.

45:21.621 --> 45:22.689
- But it has--
- Is it bright?

45:22.722 --> 45:23.556
It's super bright.

45:23.590 --> 45:25.558
Okay.
Let me show you this here, Luis.

45:25.592 --> 45:27.560
I have this amazing sofa.

45:27.594 --> 45:29.629
Being near the water
and everything

45:29.662 --> 45:32.399
could really, really work.

45:32.432 --> 45:33.667
(Luis)
Every apartment is
very different

45:33.700 --> 45:34.801
when it comes to staging.

45:34.834 --> 45:37.070
I'm not too sure

45:37.070 --> 45:39.506
what I want to do
with 92 Laight Street just yet.

45:39.539 --> 45:40.540
But I do know one thing.

45:40.573 --> 45:42.909
I want this place
to look like a piece of art.

45:42.942 --> 45:45.879
I want this place
to photograph incredibly.

45:48.248 --> 45:49.249
Something like this.

45:49.282 --> 45:50.817
Uh...

45:50.850 --> 45:51.818
No.

45:51.851 --> 45:53.586
These are, like,
dining table bases.

45:53.620 --> 45:55.689
This, I think, is too, like,
Tribeca loft.

45:55.722 --> 45:57.557
- You like this?
- I don't like it.

45:57.590 --> 45:58.558
Is that something
that you imagined?

45:58.591 --> 45:59.826
(Luis)
Whiter. Whiter.

45:59.859 --> 46:02.662
I think white is the way to go,
at least in the living room.

46:02.696 --> 46:03.663
I love it.

46:03.697 --> 46:04.664
Actually, this, yes.

46:04.698 --> 46:05.699
I like this texture, though.

46:07.267 --> 46:08.702
You're bad.
[laughs]

46:10.403 --> 46:11.371
I like this.

46:11.404 --> 46:13.173
Holy [bleep].
I like this. I like this.

46:13.206 --> 46:14.507
I like this.
This right here.

46:14.541 --> 46:15.508
That could work.

46:15.542 --> 46:16.543
Ooh.

46:16.576 --> 46:18.411
I need to see that place.

46:18.445 --> 46:20.847
This is actually like
drugs to me.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.149
I love it.
I love it.

46:23.183 --> 46:26.619
Airy, light,
but still warm and comfortable.

46:26.653 --> 46:27.654
I--I see.

46:27.687 --> 46:30.557
- You get it.
- Yes, I get it.

46:30.590 --> 46:32.525
Okay, so what do you think?
Do you have a budget?

46:32.559 --> 46:34.694
Yes, I do.

46:34.728 --> 46:36.563
He doesn't want to spend
too much.

46:36.596 --> 46:39.499
I knew you were going there.

46:39.532 --> 46:40.800
12,000.

46:40.834 --> 46:43.737
(Daniela)
12,000?

46:43.770 --> 46:46.072
For an apartment this size,

46:46.072 --> 46:48.508
three-bedroom,
would be 18,000.

46:48.541 --> 46:50.410
Um...

46:50.443 --> 46:51.511
I think
it's a great deal, Luis.

46:51.544 --> 46:52.979
I actually know,
I know for a fact

46:53.079 --> 46:53.980
that it's a good deal.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.883
But over 12,
he's not doing it.

46:56.916 --> 46:59.219
It's kind of tight, no?

46:59.252 --> 47:00.553
Listen, I--I get it.

47:00.587 --> 47:02.522
I get you have manpower
that needs to be paid.

47:02.555 --> 47:04.691
And I would tell you if I think
my clients can come up.

47:04.724 --> 47:06.359
- This guy is, like--
- That's not the case.

47:10.030 --> 47:13.566
I need this to happen.

47:13.600 --> 47:14.501
All right.

47:14.534 --> 47:16.536
But it's a one-time deal.

47:16.569 --> 47:17.604
I swear.

47:17.637 --> 47:20.540
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

47:20.573 --> 47:21.908
Do me a favor--
stop being so beautiful

47:21.941 --> 47:22.942
'cause it's, like, bad.

47:23.043 --> 47:24.144
Oh.

47:24.177 --> 47:25.311
It's bad for the world.

47:25.345 --> 47:26.312
It's actually good
for the world.

47:26.346 --> 47:27.514
Oh, one more thing.

47:27.547 --> 47:30.550
I need the apartment furnished
tomorrow.

47:30.583 --> 47:32.585
(Daniela)
Uh...guys!

47:42.829 --> 47:44.164
Hello?

47:44.197 --> 47:45.365
(both)
Hi.

47:45.398 --> 47:46.366
(Ryan)
You look pretty.

47:46.399 --> 47:47.367
Thank you.
Good to see you.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.069
You have presents for me?

47:49.069 --> 47:50.337
Sort of.

47:50.370 --> 47:52.639
Congratulations
on the two sells.

47:52.672 --> 47:53.673
Yes.

47:53.707 --> 47:55.075
But you have two left.

47:55.075 --> 47:56.176
We do have two left,
so that's why

47:56.209 --> 47:57.177
I wanted to talk to you.

47:57.210 --> 47:58.678
Uh-oh.

47:58.712 --> 48:02.248
The last two are
a little tricky,

48:02.282 --> 48:05.218
but I do have an idea.

48:05.251 --> 48:09.189
What if we combined them?

48:09.222 --> 48:10.190
They're new.

48:10.223 --> 48:11.191
They are new.

48:11.224 --> 48:12.192
We just finished.

48:12.225 --> 48:13.893
I understand.

48:13.927 --> 48:16.663
I'm not renovating
a brand-new building.

48:16.696 --> 48:17.497
So I thought you'd say that.

48:17.530 --> 48:21.735
So I met with an architect.

48:21.768 --> 48:22.769
Wow.

48:22.802 --> 48:23.837
And he came up with

48:23.870 --> 48:27.607
the most economical combination
possibility.

48:27.640 --> 48:28.641
And this is easy.

48:28.675 --> 48:29.809
You're really just
doing the stairwell

48:29.843 --> 48:31.211
after removing a kitchen.

48:31.244 --> 48:34.047
And then we have one apartment
that has four bedrooms.

48:34.047 --> 48:36.483
It could be pretty incredible.

48:36.516 --> 48:37.517
Pretty floor plans.

48:37.550 --> 48:38.518
Thank you.

48:38.551 --> 48:39.953
You did a great presentation.

48:40.053 --> 48:42.055
- Yes, thank you.
- Love it.

48:42.055 --> 48:44.057
I'm not doing the work.

48:47.494 --> 48:48.795
I also thought
you'd say that,

48:48.828 --> 48:51.431
so I already have
a buyer.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.567
You have a buyer?

48:54.601 --> 48:55.568
Yep.

48:55.602 --> 48:57.203
Take that, Yvonne.

48:57.237 --> 48:58.505
It's like bam, bam.

48:58.538 --> 49:00.006
Buyer.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.508
(Ryan)
After I met with Andres Escobar,

49:01.541 --> 49:03.543
I met
with some $6-million buyers

49:03.576 --> 49:06.680
to see if they'd be interested
in doing a combination.

49:06.713 --> 49:07.681
So you think it'll work?

49:07.714 --> 49:09.482
Yeah, I really like
that idea.

49:09.516 --> 49:11.017
How much?

49:11.017 --> 49:12.585
I didn't want to go to them
and start talking about numbers

49:12.619 --> 49:14.621
until you consented
to the work.

49:20.260 --> 49:22.062
Okay,
I'll do the work

49:22.095 --> 49:23.730
if they come to full ask.

49:23.763 --> 49:25.331
Don't move.

49:25.365 --> 49:26.666
Hi, how are you?

49:26.700 --> 49:29.536
So they will do the work.
They will combine it.

49:29.569 --> 49:33.873
And the price is 631.

49:33.907 --> 49:35.742
Well, that's what
the asking price is.

49:35.775 --> 49:38.578
It's 315 plus 316.

49:38.611 --> 49:40.847
That's how I did the math.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.515
[sighs]

49:42.549 --> 49:44.184
No.
They're not gonna do that.

49:44.217 --> 49:46.753
So you're basically wanting
a massive discount,

49:46.786 --> 49:48.388
plus telling the developer
to do the work,

49:48.421 --> 49:49.522
and that's an insult.

49:49.556 --> 49:51.524
Work on them, please.
Work on them.

49:51.558 --> 49:54.728
Thank you.

49:54.761 --> 49:55.729
[exhales]

49:55.762 --> 49:56.863
All right.

49:56.896 --> 49:58.264
We're almost there.

49:58.298 --> 50:00.900
It's just, like,
a little, little, little thing.

50:00.934 --> 50:05.705
Um, they're offering
$5,750,000.

50:05.739 --> 50:07.640
Then I'm not doing the work.

50:07.674 --> 50:09.776
I'm not doing it.
I'm done.

50:17.183 --> 50:19.185
(Ryan)
They're offering $5,750,000.

50:19.219 --> 50:20.987
Then I'm not doing the work.

50:21.021 --> 50:22.088
I'm done.

50:22.122 --> 50:23.089
- Okay.
- It doesn't make sense.

50:23.123 --> 50:25.558
Okay.
Here's the alternative.

50:25.592 --> 50:27.560
We know we sold the third floor
and the fifth floor like that,

50:27.594 --> 50:28.561
right?

50:28.595 --> 50:29.763
You keep reminding me of that.

50:29.796 --> 50:31.297
Yeah, yeah,
because it was an amazing feat.

50:32.565 --> 50:33.733
But...

50:33.767 --> 50:36.436
I don't think I can honestly
sell both of the apartments

50:36.469 --> 50:38.872
for full ask separately.

50:38.905 --> 50:40.774
We'll probably have
to negotiate

50:40.807 --> 50:42.676
if we wait
for two individual buyers.

50:42.709 --> 50:48.782
But right now, we can sell both
of them to one person, all cash.

50:48.815 --> 50:50.817
You want to move on
to your other projects.

50:54.621 --> 50:57.057
575.

50:57.090 --> 50:59.292
I'll do the work.
They pay for it.

50:59.325 --> 51:01.428
So I don't know
what holiday you celebrate,

51:01.461 --> 51:02.862
but whatever holidays
you do celebrate

51:02.896 --> 51:03.797
that are really exciting
for you,

51:03.830 --> 51:05.198
today is that day.

51:05.231 --> 51:07.634
575.
They will do the work.

51:07.667 --> 51:09.102
But your buyer
has to pay for it.

51:09.135 --> 51:12.906
The work's gonna cost
about 250,000.

51:12.939 --> 51:14.240
This is New York.

51:14.274 --> 51:18.078
Things don't just
happen for free.

51:18.078 --> 51:19.546
What do you mean,
that doesn't make sense?

51:19.579 --> 51:21.681
I have to get this deal done
right now.

51:21.715 --> 51:24.150
Oh, my God, you're killing me.

51:24.184 --> 51:25.251
I have one week left.

51:25.285 --> 51:26.553
If I lose these buyers,

51:26.586 --> 51:27.554
then I don't know
if I'm going to be able

51:27.587 --> 51:29.856
to find another one in time.

51:29.889 --> 51:31.591
Oh, man.

51:31.624 --> 51:32.692
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

51:32.726 --> 51:34.861
Um...

51:35.895 --> 51:37.897
We just sold out
230 East 63rd.

51:37.931 --> 51:39.232
They're gonna pay
for the build-out.

51:39.265 --> 51:41.768
575, and we just sold out
the building.

51:41.801 --> 51:43.737
Congratulations.

51:43.770 --> 51:45.905
I don't know
who Yvonne's last broker was,

51:45.939 --> 51:47.841
but whoever you are,

51:47.874 --> 51:49.242
I win.

51:49.275 --> 51:50.777
So congratulations.

51:50.810 --> 51:53.880
Here's your next project
to sell out.

51:53.913 --> 51:55.348
What?
What do you mean?

51:55.382 --> 51:56.616
This is the next building.

51:58.284 --> 52:01.421
And we have seven others
that are under construction now.

52:01.454 --> 52:02.856
Bingo.

52:02.889 --> 52:04.724
You have
seven other projects?

52:04.758 --> 52:05.759
Yes.

52:11.231 --> 52:13.400
(Ryan)
I mean,
with seven new buildings,

52:13.433 --> 52:16.469
I could get Emilia a ring
even bigger than Yvonne's,

52:16.503 --> 52:18.638
or I could get myself
a Maserati.

52:18.672 --> 52:20.373
Nope.

52:20.407 --> 52:21.808
That would be lame.

52:21.841 --> 52:22.809
Bye.

52:22.842 --> 52:23.910
- Bye.
- You're the best.

52:23.943 --> 52:25.945
- Thank you.
- I love you and Emilia.

52:28.848 --> 52:30.984
We're in the midst
of something amazing.

52:31.084 --> 52:33.319
Oh, my goodness.

52:33.353 --> 52:34.721
This is the one.

52:49.903 --> 52:52.505
I think I'm getting aroused.

52:52.539 --> 52:53.673
Let's talk about price.

52:53.707 --> 52:54.774
You get it to 5 million,
you got yourself a deal.

52:54.808 --> 52:56.743
19,060,000.

52:56.776 --> 52:59.112
34 million.
Mm.

52:59.145 --> 53:01.114
I find your number
a little bit insulting.

53:01.147 --> 53:02.415
What?

53:02.449 --> 53:03.850
We're not gonna settle
for anything less.

53:03.883 --> 53:05.852
We have no choice.

53:05.885 --> 53:06.853
You know, I could easily find
another broker.

53:06.886 --> 53:07.787
Then I'm not the broker for you.

53:07.821 --> 53:09.055
Take the number.

53:09.089 --> 53:10.290
Let's just end this.

I'm not gonna let you
go down like that.

We can't--no, no, no.

53:17.230 --> 53:19.132
