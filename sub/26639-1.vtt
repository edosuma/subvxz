00:01.640 --> 00:04.390
(mystical music)

00:12.890 --> 00:15.007
- [Narrator] The legend of Frankenstein

00:15.007 --> 00:17.770
is known throughout the world,

00:17.770 --> 00:20.810
as recorded by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley

00:20.810 --> 00:25.010
in her classic novel, how
more than two centuries ago

00:25.010 --> 00:28.790
a scientist named Victor
Frankenstein created

00:28.790 --> 00:33.790
from corpses and brought to
life an immortal monster.

00:34.500 --> 00:39.280
But the story of Frankenstein
was just the beginning.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.860
There have been others, some
bearing the Frankenstein name,

00:43.860 --> 00:48.200
who have followed in Victor's
unorthodox footsteps.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.273
There are many Tales of Frankenstein.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.620
These are some of them.

00:56.297 --> 00:59.047
(dramatic music)

01:25.458 --> 01:27.541
(grunts)

02:07.401 --> 02:09.234
- Victor Frankenstein.

02:28.309 --> 02:31.059
(birds chirping)

02:43.363 --> 02:44.300
- [Irma] I want to remember

02:44.300 --> 02:46.500
my (speaks foreign language) Gregore,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.710
though as not to repeat the mistake

02:48.710 --> 02:51.190
of your infamous ancestor.

02:51.190 --> 02:53.880
Follow my instructions.

02:53.880 --> 02:58.150
If my theory and technique are correct,

02:58.150 --> 03:02.870
the brain, once transplanted
and reactivated,

03:02.870 --> 03:06.389
should retain all of the memories, skills,

03:06.389 --> 03:09.513
and feelings of its former owner.

03:10.530 --> 03:14.683
I remain your colleague,
Dr. Irma Reichman.

03:22.349 --> 03:24.173
Dr. Irma Reichman.

03:33.569 --> 03:37.090
- The fraud of Frankenstein,
the other children call me.

03:37.090 --> 03:42.090
My teacher, Master Thomas,
the self-styled man of faith,

03:42.277 --> 03:46.309
he told me that I was born
with this twisted body

03:46.309 --> 03:50.690
because of your sin, cousin Victor,

03:50.690 --> 03:54.323
because of what you did a century ago.

03:55.430 --> 03:57.530
But not this time.

03:57.530 --> 04:02.530
No murders, no revenge, no horror.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.043
In addition to your
notes, I also have Irma's.

04:07.320 --> 04:12.320
When my, my Adonis awakens
and takes his first breath,

04:16.070 --> 04:20.260
they will see that
basically you were right,

04:21.330 --> 04:25.793
and respect the name of
Frankenstein once again.

04:27.120 --> 04:32.120
There's only one vital
component that is lacking.

04:46.228 --> 04:49.145
(mysterious music)

05:03.850 --> 05:05.503
Just one.

05:09.206 --> 05:10.039
Good.

05:14.490 --> 05:16.930
- [Irma] Again, Dr. Frankenstein,

05:16.930 --> 05:20.077
I appreciate your regarding
my knowledge, skills,

05:20.077 --> 05:24.610
experience, and reputation
concerning the human brain

05:24.610 --> 05:26.203
with such high esteem.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.830
Please continue our correspondence,

05:29.830 --> 05:33.880
but for now, I remain
your colleague and friend.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.723
Dr. Irma Reichman.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.250
My (speaks foreign language) Gregore,

05:39.250 --> 05:42.580
your self description reads so incongruous

05:42.580 --> 05:45.905
with the beauty of your written words.

05:45.905 --> 05:49.580
If only we could meet, but my health

05:49.580 --> 05:51.363
precludes that from happening.

05:53.257 --> 05:58.257
Ugh, Gregore, the cancer
has taken its toll.

06:00.210 --> 06:03.845
If only circumstances had been different,

06:03.845 --> 06:06.501
we might have shared a love,

06:06.501 --> 06:09.223
one of mind more than body.

06:10.260 --> 06:13.793
But fate can be capricious and cruel.

06:15.757 --> 06:18.720
I have already taken
measures to ensure that

06:18.720 --> 06:22.493
my one properly functioning
organ be real to you.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.540
Study it, use it.

06:26.540 --> 06:30.973
If you need to, experiment with it.

06:30.973 --> 06:34.393
In that way, we will remain together.

06:36.693 --> 06:40.933
Goodbye for now, (speaks
foreign language), Irma.

06:42.910 --> 06:43.953
- I love you, too.

06:47.065 --> 06:49.648
(phone buzzes)

06:54.140 --> 06:55.063
Yes, Hussman.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.133
What?

06:58.290 --> 06:59.433
You say you have it?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.213
I-I'll be right over.

07:03.268 --> 07:05.851
(upbeat music)

07:45.495 --> 07:48.239
- Ah, Herr Frankenstein.

07:48.239 --> 07:49.656
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.340
- Sorry, Dr. Frankenstein.

07:56.340 --> 07:57.820
Prompt as always.

07:57.820 --> 07:59.870
- Are you sure it is him?

07:59.870 --> 08:02.470
- And sweet as a summer's
apple, so to speak.

08:02.470 --> 08:04.460
Nothing like a good apple, I say,

08:04.460 --> 08:06.330
at least until the worms get at it,

08:06.330 --> 08:07.530
if you know what I mean.

08:14.180 --> 08:17.470
- Professor Hans Broedecker,
how well I remember

08:17.470 --> 08:21.460
the day you booted me out of
the university for my ideas.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.111
Heresy, blasphemy you called it.

08:24.111 --> 08:25.490
(scoffs in disgust)

08:25.490 --> 08:28.260
- Smartest man in
Bavaria, so they tell me.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.833
Present company excluded.

08:36.900 --> 08:40.120
Kicked the bucket just this
morning after his first class,

08:40.120 --> 08:42.730
right there on the stairs.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.563
- Was it rare?

08:43.563 --> 08:44.440
- Bad ticker.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.623
Never came close to bumping
the ol' noggin on the way down.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.173
Herr Frankenstein.

08:56.110 --> 08:59.777
(Gregore scoffs in disgust)

09:04.531 --> 09:07.448
(coughs pointedly)

09:08.900 --> 09:12.523
- Sorry, I'm not as
rich as my late cousin.

09:13.730 --> 09:16.253
- I can see this here one's special,

09:17.610 --> 09:19.080
and you know the risks I've been taking

09:19.080 --> 09:20.400
for the likes of you.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.063
So, as they say, business before pleasure.

09:28.999 --> 09:31.749
(dramatic music)

10:12.481 --> 10:15.981
(speaks foreign language)

10:33.903 --> 10:35.071
(grunts)

10:35.071 --> 10:35.904
- [Gertrude] What the--

10:35.904 --> 10:37.577
- [Gregore] Oh, so sorry, madam.

10:37.577 --> 10:39.520
- Out of all the clumsy--

10:39.520 --> 10:40.353
- Miss?

10:40.353 --> 10:41.186
- Oh.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.433
How's business?

11:00.550 --> 11:02.517
- Like always, Gertrude.

11:04.436 --> 11:07.019
(man laughing)

11:12.792 --> 11:15.036
- Good morning, (speaks foreign language).

11:15.036 --> 11:16.900
- Good morning.

11:16.900 --> 11:17.950
- You should pick me.

11:18.955 --> 11:20.405
- You should take both of us.

11:27.184 --> 11:30.217
- Um, maybe just her.

11:31.910 --> 11:34.480
- [Gertrude] No pretty Frau
to keep you warm tonight?

11:40.847 --> 11:41.680
- Helga!

11:45.930 --> 11:50.453
My beautiful, my beautiful
Helga, Fraulein Helga.

11:51.766 --> 11:53.835
Now, now, now, now, what's wrong with you?

11:53.835 --> 11:55.247
- [Helga] Come back tomorrow, Franz!

11:55.247 --> 11:57.003
- You know my marks are good.
- Maybe.

11:57.003 --> 11:58.330
- Huh, I don't care too

11:58.330 --> 12:01.446
much about your--
- Don't touch me!

12:01.446 --> 12:02.279
Franz!

12:06.647 --> 12:10.680
- Don't you touch her, you
(speaks foreign language).

12:10.680 --> 12:12.915
(Gregore yells)

12:12.915 --> 12:14.447
The rat!

12:14.447 --> 12:17.902
(Gregore screams in pain)

12:17.902 --> 12:20.204
(Gregore grunts)

12:20.204 --> 12:22.954
(dramatic music)

12:49.451 --> 12:51.451
(cries)

13:50.523 --> 13:55.073
I am now as ugly as the monster
you created, Cousin Victor,

13:57.099 --> 13:58.999
but that should not matter to my Irma,

13:59.880 --> 14:01.867
who loves me for my brain.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.770
I am sorry, my Adonis.

14:25.770 --> 14:30.770
You have waited a long time,
you can wait awhile longer.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.073
- [Irma] Won't remember,

14:35.073 --> 14:37.554
my (speaks foreign language), Gregore.

14:37.554 --> 14:42.050
The brain, once transplanted
and reactivated,

14:42.050 --> 14:44.993
should retain all the memories, skills,

14:45.850 --> 14:48.533
and feelings of its former owner.

14:50.105 --> 14:52.855
The feelings, feelings, feelings.

15:05.090 --> 15:08.007
(women chattering)

15:26.401 --> 15:29.151
(woman laughing)

15:35.782 --> 15:38.532
(fire crackling)

15:39.666 --> 15:42.499
(women screaming)

16:05.977 --> 16:08.644
(phone buzzing)

16:20.259 --> 16:21.930
What is it, Hussman?

16:21.930 --> 16:23.250
- [Hussman] I'm assuming
you haven't heard,

16:23.250 --> 16:24.330
Dr. Frankenstein?

16:24.330 --> 16:25.163
- Heard, what?

16:25.163 --> 16:28.460
Speak up, man, it's the
middle of the night.

16:28.460 --> 16:33.153
- Nasty fire at the music
hall, during a rehearsal.

16:34.300 --> 16:37.760
So hot it melted the door locks.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.493
Poor babies, they must regret
their decision to leave Paris.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.050
Most of them croaked choking on the smoke,

16:54.050 --> 16:55.973
so there's not too much damage.

16:59.750 --> 17:00.583
- Fascinating.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.170
- Well, except for what got burned,

17:06.170 --> 17:07.883
none of them too hard on the eyes.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.353
Unless of course one's picky.

17:14.231 --> 17:16.520
(Gregore grunts in disgust)

17:16.520 --> 17:18.440
Well, there are one or two exceptions.

17:47.190 --> 17:50.170
- See anything that strikes your fancy,

17:50.170 --> 17:52.890
or should I just Christmas
wrap the lot of them?

17:53.979 --> 17:56.729
(dramatic music)

18:38.591 --> 18:41.258
(lips smacking)

18:43.195 --> 18:46.112
(thunder cracking)

19:03.042 --> 19:06.125
(electronic buzzing)

19:07.307 --> 19:08.390
- Good, good.

19:11.555 --> 19:13.972
Let the spirit and knowledge,

19:15.572 --> 19:20.563
along with my dearest Irma, guide me.

19:22.280 --> 19:27.280
And pray that when she
wakes up to a perfect body

19:29.410 --> 19:33.760
that I've created, the body of Venus,

19:33.760 --> 19:38.103
that she still remembers.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.643
- [Irma] If only circumstances
had been different,

19:43.480 --> 19:47.397
we might have shared a love,
one of mind more than body.

19:50.347 --> 19:53.264
(thunder crashing)

20:00.891 --> 20:03.974
(electronic buzzing)

20:24.591 --> 20:27.508
(liquids burbling)

21:57.726 --> 22:00.393
(clock ticking)

22:11.624 --> 22:13.624
Irma, Irma, my creation!

22:21.868 --> 22:23.868
Irma, don't you know me?

22:27.916 --> 22:30.499
What I've done for you, for us?

22:35.724 --> 22:39.870
Oh, your vocal chords, they
won't function for awhile.

22:39.870 --> 22:41.473
They need time to heal.

22:45.620 --> 22:48.703
You're young again, perfect in every way.

23:08.660 --> 23:11.230
Oh, oh, what is it, the scars?

23:11.230 --> 23:15.950
Don't worry, it won't be long
until they're healed also.

23:15.950 --> 23:16.963
I've seen to that.

23:25.532 --> 23:27.340
Irma, don't you know me?

23:27.340 --> 23:29.760
It's, it's Gregore.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.933
I don't understand.

23:32.890 --> 23:35.697
The brain should be functioning perfectly.

23:49.400 --> 23:54.400
Do-don't you recognize me,
(speaks foreign language)?

23:58.880 --> 24:00.547
You do recognize me.

24:04.612 --> 24:05.445
My love.

24:09.716 --> 24:12.710
(Gregore chokes)

24:12.710 --> 24:16.210
(speaks foreign language)

24:23.951 --> 24:26.784
(flesh squishing)

24:37.848 --> 24:40.598
(tranquil music)

25:18.901 --> 25:19.734
- Gregore.

25:21.340 --> 25:23.087
Gregore, my (speaks foreign language).

25:36.330 --> 25:39.703
Your vocal chords will
heal, as will your scars.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.643
Just give time.

25:46.628 --> 25:47.545
My beloved.

26:16.330 --> 26:18.580
(grunting)

27:28.511 --> 27:31.511
(crickets chirping)

27:42.899 --> 27:45.649
(dramatic music)

28:22.967 --> 28:24.423
- The grave death.

28:25.470 --> 28:28.183
It's the plague that rots the flesh.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.990
- Should you really be doing that?

28:31.990 --> 28:35.140
- Now please, Sylvie,
don't lecture me anymore,

28:35.140 --> 28:36.520
this is everything I need

28:36.520 --> 28:39.180
to calm my nerves.
- I know, I know, Elsa,

28:39.180 --> 28:41.900
but it's just the thought
of my skin turning gray

28:41.900 --> 28:43.133
and withering, I,

28:43.133 --> 28:44.720
I just.
- I know.

28:44.720 --> 28:48.520
- Oh, forgive us, Frankenstein.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.470
- We, we didn't mean anything.

28:50.470 --> 28:55.470
- It's all right, I've
learned to cope with tragedy.

28:55.740 --> 28:57.833
- Oh, as have I.

28:59.401 --> 29:00.401
- And still no cure.

29:01.260 --> 29:04.840
I wonder if our village will
ever be rid of the curse--

29:04.840 --> 29:07.653
- Yes, before it puts
us all in our graves.

29:08.550 --> 29:10.700
- My husband said it's
carried by the wind.

29:11.556 --> 29:16.490
- No matter what the cause
is, one can't be too careful.

29:16.490 --> 29:18.670
- Every night when I go
to bed with the dread

29:18.670 --> 29:23.225
that when I awaken in the
morning, beside my dear Claus.

29:23.225 --> 29:25.003
- Or look into the mirror.

29:26.930 --> 29:31.343
Well, I must be off now,
I've got my chores to do.

29:31.343 --> 29:35.160
- We'll see you later, Frau
Frankenstein, at the funeral.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.623
- Yes, we'll be there for you.

29:39.669 --> 29:42.620
Good day, Frau Frankenstein.

29:42.620 --> 29:43.453
- Good day.

29:54.506 --> 29:57.173
(intense music)

30:01.645 --> 30:04.145
(phone rings)

30:15.720 --> 30:16.553
Hello?

30:18.080 --> 30:18.913
Who?

30:19.970 --> 30:21.700
Oh, hello Vincent.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.350
- I wish to express my condolences,

30:23.350 --> 30:25.343
Frau Frankenstein, for your loss.

30:26.410 --> 30:30.140
(Lenore speaks foreign language)

30:30.140 --> 30:32.640
I know that you and my late husband

30:32.640 --> 30:36.230
weren't exactly friends, but I--

30:36.230 --> 30:38.890
- That's not my main reason for calling.

30:38.890 --> 30:40.103
It's about the ring.

30:41.060 --> 30:41.893
- The ring?

30:42.970 --> 30:45.303
You want to buy it?

30:46.410 --> 30:48.320
- With all due respect, Frau Frankenstein,

30:48.320 --> 30:50.387
your husband has no further use for it.

30:50.387 --> 30:53.080
But I on the other hand, well...

30:53.080 --> 30:54.643
Just name your figure.

30:56.621 --> 31:01.200
- I-I'm sorry Vincent, but
the ring is not for sale,

31:01.200 --> 31:02.353
at any cost.

31:04.660 --> 31:08.110
You see, it was Helmut's
request that we...

31:09.760 --> 31:10.593
- You did what?

31:12.953 --> 31:15.453
(cat purring)

31:37.266 --> 31:40.016
(birds chirping)

32:04.029 --> 32:06.279
(chuckles)

32:08.440 --> 32:11.993
- All right already, no
need to wake the dead.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.193
Although that is an intriguing idea.

32:18.380 --> 32:19.865
Who is it?

32:19.865 --> 32:21.967
- It is I, Vincent.

32:21.967 --> 32:24.953
- Ah, Vincent, come in, come in.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.870
Come to see my latest treasure, huh?

32:28.870 --> 32:31.803
Smuggled in from South
America just three days ago.

32:33.160 --> 32:37.250
Handsome, isn't, uh, wasn't he? (chuckles)

32:37.250 --> 32:40.410
But I must say he's looking a
mite better than you, of late.

32:40.410 --> 32:42.500
What's the matter, my friend?

32:42.500 --> 32:44.540
- Johann, I've come to speak with you

32:44.540 --> 32:47.430
about a matter of grave importance.

32:47.430 --> 32:48.303
- Grave?

32:49.660 --> 32:53.283
I'm interested, which
calls for a libation.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.110
Here we are, my friend.

33:02.110 --> 33:05.453
The best amontillado that francs can buy.

33:08.840 --> 33:11.790
It will do you good to put some
color back in those cheeks.

33:13.510 --> 33:16.770
Although I dare say, you look
like you could benefit also

33:16.770 --> 33:18.913
from a thick steak and potatoes.

33:20.060 --> 33:21.763
- Just the wine, thank you.

33:30.700 --> 33:33.860
- And now, my friend,
perhaps you can explain

33:33.860 --> 33:38.440
this pale countenance and
those trembling hands.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.790
You look like you've seen a ghost.

33:40.790 --> 33:42.990
- No ghost, Frankenstein.

33:45.867 --> 33:47.600
- Frankenstein?

33:47.600 --> 33:50.240
Oh, you mean your former neighbor,

33:50.240 --> 33:52.077
not the monster that his famous ancestor

33:52.077 --> 33:54.660
was supposed to have stitched together?

33:54.660 --> 33:59.660
But Herr Frankenstein lies
moldering in his grave,

34:00.480 --> 34:02.187
at least last I heard he was.

34:05.410 --> 34:09.030
- What I must, what I'm
compelled to tell you,

34:09.030 --> 34:12.420
begins when Herr Frankenstein
was very much alive.

34:12.420 --> 34:16.243
Alive, despised, and feared.

34:18.150 --> 34:21.640
Herr Frankenstein, my
neighbor, was a fiend.

34:21.640 --> 34:25.013
Oh, how he enjoyed
taunting me, tormenting me.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.500
He knew all about my
obsession for precious jewels,

34:28.500 --> 34:29.713
for possessing them.

34:31.410 --> 34:34.970
He wore a ring with the
most magnificent jewel

34:34.970 --> 34:37.003
my eyes had ever beheld.

34:38.100 --> 34:40.893
It was something I had to own for myself.

34:41.820 --> 34:44.414
And though I was willing
to pay well for that ring,

34:44.414 --> 34:47.403
Herr Frankenstein would not
sell it to me for any price.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.900
Frankenstein knew how not owning

34:52.900 --> 34:55.313
the ring haunted me, day and night.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.583
But fate was about to intervene.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.810
As you know, people
feared Herr Frankenstein,

35:06.810 --> 35:09.560
feared my might be conducting
diabolic experiments

35:09.560 --> 35:10.967
like his forbearer.

35:13.177 --> 35:16.483
But this Frankenstein had no
interest in creating monsters.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.203
- Must you always taunt
our poor neighbor, Helmut?

35:29.020 --> 35:31.540
Vincent means no harm.

35:31.540 --> 35:35.670
- Vincent is an idiot, what
with all his precious jewels.

35:35.670 --> 35:38.430
Everyone in this town is an idiot.

35:38.430 --> 35:41.270
Mein Gott, I wish we
had never left Geneva.

35:41.270 --> 35:43.260
- You've forgotten already, husband,

35:43.260 --> 35:46.103
that we didn't leave by choice.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.020
- Idiots are everywhere.

35:49.020 --> 35:51.910
- All right, forget about Vincent.

35:51.910 --> 35:53.840
It's you I'm worried about.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.023
- Are you really?

35:56.180 --> 35:58.040
Concerned that I'll outlive you?

35:58.040 --> 35:59.380
Concerned that you'll never get to spend

35:59.380 --> 36:02.420
that incredible fortune
you married me for?

36:02.420 --> 36:06.653
That I'll get strong and vigorous
and stay that way forever?

36:08.940 --> 36:12.310
Victor was right in studying
the ancient alchemists,

36:12.310 --> 36:14.080
as well as men of science.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.640
Paracelsus, Agrippa, Dippel.

36:17.640 --> 36:22.380
Men who saw the gift
that Victor Frankenstein

36:22.380 --> 36:24.500
stumbled upon accidentally,

36:24.500 --> 36:26.833
and bestowed upon the so-called monster.

36:27.890 --> 36:30.990
I re-discovered that secret, Lenore.

36:30.990 --> 36:34.850
I've extracted it,
defined it, isolated it.

36:34.850 --> 36:37.290
All through Victor's notes!

36:37.290 --> 36:38.990
- But you can't be serious about trying

36:38.990 --> 36:41.283
this concoction on yourself.

36:42.130 --> 36:43.920
It might have the opposite effect, and--

36:43.920 --> 36:46.860
- I'm touched by your concern, Lenore.

36:46.860 --> 36:50.540
So maybe after I've
become young and immortal,

36:50.540 --> 36:52.040
I'll share this gift with you.

36:53.230 --> 36:57.760
But don't worry, I have
tested it again and again,

36:57.760 --> 37:02.120
on small animals with
comparatively short lifespans.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.100
And I assure you there
is absolutely nothing

37:06.100 --> 37:07.693
that can possibly go wrong.

37:21.910 --> 37:22.743
Yes!

37:24.360 --> 37:29.327
I can feel it already, in every
blood vessel, muscle, nerve.

37:30.690 --> 37:31.650
I feel...

37:32.570 --> 37:33.403
- Helmut.

37:34.293 --> 37:35.460
- I feel, ahh!

37:36.529 --> 37:39.933
- Please no, Helmut.

37:39.933 --> 37:44.193
Please, no, oh my God, Helmut!

37:44.193 --> 37:45.443
- The great death.

37:54.861 --> 37:57.611
(Helmut moaning)

37:59.980 --> 38:03.543
Why, why, why me?

38:04.420 --> 38:05.253
Why now?

38:07.952 --> 38:10.702
(Lenore gasping)

38:35.830 --> 38:37.983
- And may you rest in peace.

38:40.450 --> 38:41.283
Furthermore--

38:41.283 --> 38:44.120
- He's all yours now, Frau Frankenstein.

38:44.120 --> 38:44.953
- Thank you.

38:48.900 --> 38:52.640
- Furthermore, while
Herr Frankenstein's ways

38:52.640 --> 38:56.986
were a little different, he
was still a child of God,

38:56.986 --> 39:01.986
who I pray will have mercy
upon his immortal soul.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.357
- Thankfully you almost weren't--

39:08.710 --> 39:11.100
- Thank you for coming.

39:11.100 --> 39:12.503
- If you need anything.

39:20.850 --> 39:21.683
- Father?

39:22.810 --> 39:25.263
- May God protect you, Frau Frankenstein.

39:39.980 --> 39:42.690
- So there Herr Frankenstein lies,

39:42.690 --> 39:45.390
and still on his finger the damnable ring,

39:45.390 --> 39:50.090
the blood red ruby that's become my curse

39:51.211 --> 39:54.000
and driven me to the brink of madness.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.373
- And you want that ring?

39:56.350 --> 39:58.700
- It's the only way I'll
ever know peace again.

39:59.770 --> 40:01.703
You'll help me, won't you, Johann?

40:02.760 --> 40:04.480
I don't think I could do it myself,

40:04.480 --> 40:07.050
I don't think I have the stomach for it,

40:07.050 --> 40:08.033
but you have.

40:09.760 --> 40:14.760
- Well, I, I have a shovel,
but robbing a grave?

40:17.410 --> 40:20.410
I admit that would be a new
experience, even for me,

40:20.410 --> 40:25.403
but it's been almost a week,
and remember, the plague.

40:27.410 --> 40:29.620
- We'll take precautions.

40:29.620 --> 40:31.853
- No, I am, I'm sorry, Vincent.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.083
I'm a collector, not a body snatcher.

40:36.740 --> 40:38.893
But have fun!

40:41.330 --> 40:45.073
You know, I wonder which works quicker,

40:46.590 --> 40:49.023
the plague or the worms?

40:54.151 --> 40:56.484
(owl hoots)

41:35.416 --> 41:38.166
(shovel scrapes)

42:01.574 --> 42:04.324
(dramatic music)

43:09.490 --> 43:12.133
- Buried alive, interesting.

43:13.270 --> 43:15.650
Unless, of course, Herr Frankenstein's

43:15.650 --> 43:18.230
potion actually worked.

43:18.230 --> 43:21.193
- I heard his heartbeat, it was maddening.

43:22.800 --> 43:27.223
- Probably your imagination,
or your guilty conscience.

43:28.070 --> 43:30.690
- But such strength,
that was no imagination.

43:30.690 --> 43:34.433
It was superhuman, supernatural.

43:35.530 --> 43:38.883
- Well, I, I think you for
your generous gift, old friend.

43:39.870 --> 43:44.870
You know, I once almost acquired
an authentic hand of glory,

43:45.490 --> 43:46.890
back when I lived in Arkham.

43:47.790 --> 43:50.014
But those pesky government officials,

43:50.014 --> 43:53.113
they don't always
appreciate such treasures.

43:54.090 --> 43:56.470
- Don't let it touch your bare skin.

43:56.470 --> 43:57.373
- Of course.

43:58.770 --> 44:03.003
No, I plan to preserve it
and display it under glass.

44:04.393 --> 44:08.760
So, now that Herr
Frankenstein's wonder drug

44:08.760 --> 44:12.300
seems to have run its
course, let's celebrate.

44:12.300 --> 44:14.500
- Oh, if you don't mind, it's morning,

44:14.500 --> 44:16.340
I should be on my way.

44:16.340 --> 44:19.030
- I understand, you want to get home,

44:19.030 --> 44:21.150
admire your prize, perhaps pose with it

44:21.150 --> 44:22.300
in front of the mirror.

44:23.140 --> 44:26.873
As one collector to another,
I understand perfectly.

44:49.840 --> 44:52.877
Ah, now where am I going
to put you, my lovely?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.358
(chuckles)

45:14.981 --> 45:17.648
(intense music)

45:40.356 --> 45:43.189
(hand scrabbling)

45:59.130 --> 46:01.640
- You'll never torment me again.

46:01.640 --> 46:03.010
You hear me?

46:03.010 --> 46:06.923
You stinking, fetid, mass of pestilence.

46:13.430 --> 46:15.283
- I'm sorry, did you say something?

46:16.450 --> 46:21.450
- Just talking to myself, uh,
stupid habit I must overcome.

46:21.730 --> 46:23.700
Good evening, Frau Frankenstein.

46:23.700 --> 46:25.017
- Good evening, may I?

46:50.210 --> 46:52.167
- Come to pay your respects, I see.

46:53.820 --> 46:56.423
- I come to visit my
dear Helmut every day.

46:57.750 --> 47:01.513
I prefer coming here at
night, it's more quiet.

47:03.830 --> 47:06.480
But what are you doing here at this hour?

47:06.480 --> 47:07.793
It's almost closing time.

47:09.370 --> 47:10.880
- I uh--

47:10.880 --> 47:15.430
- But since you're here,
I'd like to apologize

47:15.430 --> 47:17.623
for my late husband's
behavior towards you.

47:18.523 --> 47:22.947
It was rude and uncalled for.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.367
- It was nothing, Frau Frankenstein.

47:28.178 --> 47:31.350
- You know, I really did love him, but...

47:35.453 --> 47:37.036
His brilliant mind.

47:39.120 --> 47:44.120
I'm sure you know by now, the
tragic news about your friend.

47:46.820 --> 47:47.653
- Johann?

47:48.530 --> 47:49.833
- So you don't know.

47:52.470 --> 47:53.593
I am sorry.

47:55.020 --> 47:57.070
It appears as though it
wasn't just the pestilence

47:57.070 --> 47:59.820
that claimed your friend's life.

47:59.820 --> 48:01.900
There were marks on the throat.

48:04.074 --> 48:08.000
Finger marks, as if strangled by the hand

48:08.000 --> 48:09.343
possessing great strength.

48:25.801 --> 48:28.551
(dramatic music)

48:49.979 --> 48:52.896
(breathes heavily)

49:13.563 --> 49:16.563
(crickets chirping)

49:33.370 --> 49:36.203
(hand scrabbling)

49:40.748 --> 49:43.415
(Vincent yells)

49:52.925 --> 49:56.675
Frankenstein, I'd gladly
give it back, but...

50:04.009 --> 50:06.676
(Vincent yells)

50:24.978 --> 50:27.811
(blood splashing)

50:36.015 --> 50:38.765
(Vincent grunts)

51:18.817 --> 51:21.567
(thunder cracks)

51:22.750 --> 51:25.860
- [Narrator] Out of the
past, phantoms of a world

51:25.860 --> 51:30.340
gone by speak again the
immortal tale, Frankenstein.

51:34.220 --> 51:36.100
- [Victor] Be warned, you doctors

51:36.100 --> 51:38.730
and scientists who come after me.

51:38.730 --> 51:41.720
Be warned that man must not experiment

51:41.720 --> 51:44.160
with the secrets of life.

51:44.160 --> 51:47.100
This creature will live.

51:47.100 --> 51:48.760
- [Professor] You're
trying to play God, Victor.

51:48.760 --> 51:49.859
It's heresy!

51:49.859 --> 51:51.580
- [Victor] It's science.

51:51.580 --> 51:52.530
- [Professor] He's hideous.

51:52.530 --> 51:54.140
- [Victor] Yes, he's hideous.

51:54.140 --> 51:55.660
- [Professor] Have you any
idea what kind of horror

51:55.660 --> 51:57.590
you've let loose in England?

51:57.590 --> 51:59.260
- [Victor] Put that knife down, Professor!

51:59.260 --> 52:00.691
- [Professor] No, I can't let, ooh!

52:00.691 --> 52:01.870
(grunting)

52:01.870 --> 52:04.350
Oh, he's got me in the clutch of his hand.

52:04.350 --> 52:06.400
- [Victor] Now, what do you expect of me?

52:07.478 --> 52:11.978
- [Monster] A companion, a
woman, of the same species.

52:13.584 --> 52:17.313
One who will be my friend.

52:17.313 --> 52:19.563
This being you must create.

52:21.014 --> 52:22.172
- [Victor] No, I'll not do it.

52:22.172 --> 52:23.499
(car clattering)

52:23.499 --> 52:24.666
- Gosh darnit!

52:26.414 --> 52:28.707
(thunder crashes)

52:28.707 --> 52:31.630
It was a heck of a time
for my engine to conk out.

52:31.630 --> 52:33.890
There I was, stuck in
the middle of nowhere,

52:33.890 --> 52:36.950
about to get drowned in
Uncle Noah's next flood.

52:36.950 --> 52:39.275
Already the lightning bolts
were crashing overhead

52:39.275 --> 52:42.770
like hopped up eels at an
electrician's convention.

52:42.770 --> 52:45.193
But I suppose it could be worse.

52:47.760 --> 52:51.380
A fine kettle of gefilte
for me, Jack Anvil,

52:51.380 --> 52:54.400
enemy of criminals,
hopheads and other lowlifes.

52:54.400 --> 52:57.700
Fated to die of ammonia
like some skid row bum,

52:57.700 --> 53:00.160
instead of a more respectable way,

53:00.160 --> 53:04.084
like at the business
end of some gunzel's 45.

53:04.084 --> 53:06.667
(wolf howling)

53:17.871 --> 53:20.371
(owl hooting)

53:36.990 --> 53:38.807
I doubted I'd find a
mechanic this time of night

53:38.807 --> 53:42.240
out here in the boondocks,
but if I could just get

53:42.240 --> 53:45.723
to a phone before the
storm clouds opened up.

53:45.723 --> 53:48.640
(knocking on door)

53:56.660 --> 53:57.493
Hello?

53:59.120 --> 54:00.080
Hello?

54:00.080 --> 54:02.100
The set up seemed familiar.

54:02.100 --> 54:05.060
I recalled similar situations
that Lamont Cranston

54:05.060 --> 54:08.350
and Sam Spade found
themselves in on the radio.

54:08.350 --> 54:10.890
Well if it was good enough for them,

54:10.890 --> 54:13.307
at least the outside
looked friendly enough.

54:14.690 --> 54:15.740
- How may I help you?

54:21.144 --> 54:24.561
- Where'd they find you, Central Casting?

54:26.970 --> 54:30.513
Sorry to bother you so late,
but my jalopy's engine died.

54:31.390 --> 54:32.980
That storm's about to break any second.

54:32.980 --> 54:37.943
- Wait here, I will speak
with the owner of the house.

54:38.810 --> 54:42.833
Perhaps you may stay the night.

54:43.900 --> 54:46.790
- Didn't this guy know Halloween was over?

54:46.790 --> 54:48.480
I felt like I was one
of the East Side Kids

54:48.480 --> 54:50.063
about to meet Bela Lugosi.

54:52.430 --> 54:54.160
Can I just use your phone?

54:54.160 --> 54:55.620
Maybe there's a local gas station--

54:55.620 --> 54:58.360
- I'm sorry, sir, but the phone

55:05.180 --> 55:06.573
is dead.

55:08.410 --> 55:09.977
But if you will wait here.

55:13.820 --> 55:16.653
- [Jack] At least he
didn't say walk this way.

55:22.666 --> 55:25.083
- Can't be too careful.

55:27.370 --> 55:28.723
Burglars, you know.

55:30.008 --> 55:34.640
- Yeah, there's plenty around
here, so much to steal.

55:35.980 --> 55:39.460
Obviously this dump hadn't
been attended to in decades.

55:39.460 --> 55:42.530
It was sorely in need of a woman's touch.

55:42.530 --> 55:45.720
Any woman, even Lady MacBeth.

55:45.720 --> 55:49.150
But at least the joint was dry, and warm.

55:49.150 --> 55:51.200
I just hoped things wouldn't get too hot.

55:57.060 --> 56:00.913
- Please, make yourself comfortable.

56:05.368 --> 56:07.023
The doctor will be with you

56:13.680 --> 56:14.513
personally.

56:16.300 --> 56:17.213
- Doctor, huh?

56:18.230 --> 56:19.143
Thanks, Jeeves.

56:22.290 --> 56:23.327
Uh, Juana?

56:26.808 --> 56:27.641
Ungawa?

56:29.620 --> 56:34.620
- The name is Mogambo, sir.

56:38.700 --> 56:41.143
- Sorry, Mogambo.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.893
Where's Larry and chimp?

56:48.240 --> 56:50.720
I couldn't help but notice the painting,

56:50.720 --> 56:54.150
maybe of Dr. Jekyl
during his college days.

56:54.150 --> 56:56.310
I wonder if the doctor
was spying on me through

56:56.310 --> 56:58.840
the portrait, with eyes
that would follow me

56:58.840 --> 57:01.517
wherever I walked inside this mausoleum.

57:06.633 --> 57:07.466
My hat!

58:03.446 --> 58:05.243
- Dr. Mortality.

58:06.983 --> 58:09.142
(sighs)

58:09.142 --> 58:10.893
- Yes, Mogambo?

58:11.766 --> 58:15.470
- I believe we have finally found the one.

58:18.294 --> 58:19.127
- At last.

58:24.456 --> 58:25.289
At last.

58:33.185 --> 58:34.852
You know what to do.

58:50.700 --> 58:53.533
(thunder crashes)

58:57.876 --> 59:01.209
(enticing violin music)

59:14.538 --> 59:15.538
- [All] Sir.

59:22.457 --> 59:23.290
- Could I?

59:27.723 --> 59:30.223
- Thank you, that's very nice.

59:35.557 --> 59:36.660
Cigarette?

59:36.660 --> 59:39.160
- I'm trying to stop, I
hear those things kill ya.

59:40.760 --> 59:44.010
Did I say something about a woman's touch?

59:44.010 --> 59:46.600
Like maybe Charlie Chan's number one,

59:46.600 --> 59:48.633
two, and three daughters?

59:50.370 --> 59:53.990
- You need something warm
in your stomach, kind sir.

59:53.990 --> 59:56.406
- After being outside in the cold.

59:56.406 --> 59:58.273
- We will see to your needs.

1:00:01.454 --> 1:00:03.373
- I need to be warmed up.

1:00:03.373 --> 1:00:04.820
(chuckling)

1:00:04.820 --> 1:00:08.230
- It is oolong tea, from our homeland.

1:00:08.230 --> 1:00:12.303
Very, very hot.

1:00:14.150 --> 1:00:15.253
- Yes, you are.

1:00:19.020 --> 1:00:22.800
The tea, the tea is, Miss, uh, Miss?

1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:24.303
- Anna May.

1:00:24.303 --> 1:00:25.442
- Anna Lee.

1:00:25.442 --> 1:00:26.275
- Anna Lu.

1:00:30.335 --> 1:00:34.252
(Jack speaks foreign language)

1:00:40.130 --> 1:00:42.550
- Very good, very good.

1:00:42.550 --> 1:00:46.070
How could I refuse an offer
from silky skirts like these?

1:00:46.070 --> 1:00:50.170
Besides, the China dolls
obviously went for me.

1:00:50.170 --> 1:00:52.563
I mean, don't all dames?

1:00:53.540 --> 1:00:54.413
And so.

1:01:00.900 --> 1:01:02.039
- Oh!

1:01:02.039 --> 1:01:04.789
(girls laughing)

1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:10.020
- Women like men with brains.

1:01:10.020 --> 1:01:11.183
- Yes.
- Mm, yes.

1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:22.753
- So uh, who's this guy,
the doctor's granddaddy?

1:01:23.843 --> 1:01:26.093
(chuckles)

1:01:33.460 --> 1:01:35.840
What kind of herbs did
you say was in this?

1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:36.673
- Oolong.

1:01:38.384 --> 1:01:39.217
- Oh.

1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:44.200
The tea felt soothing as
it went down the hatch.

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:47.500
Also strange, and I wondered if somebody

1:01:47.500 --> 1:01:49.113
might have slipped me a Mickey.

1:01:52.170 --> 1:01:53.143
Say, babies,

1:01:54.810 --> 1:01:57.773
what do you say once this storm lets up,

1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:03.283
the four of us slip
out for some chop suey.

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:06.443
I know this place in Chinatown.

1:02:13.775 --> 1:02:16.275
Hey uh, who is this guy again?

1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:23.723
- You admire fine works of art?

1:02:25.010 --> 1:02:26.463
- Yeah, you could say that.

1:02:32.510 --> 1:02:36.823
- That portrait is one of
my most prized possessions.

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:39.450
You know who that is?

1:02:39.450 --> 1:02:41.420
- What is this, 20 questions?

1:02:41.420 --> 1:02:43.020
Give me a hint.

1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:46.140
Dorian Gray's second cousin, once removed.

1:02:46.140 --> 1:02:49.140
The guy reminded me of Boris Karloff.

1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:53.070
Somehow, as I started to get drowsy,

1:02:53.070 --> 1:02:57.930
I was getting the feeling that
I was about to be removed.

1:02:57.930 --> 1:03:01.530
- That's Victor Frankenstein,
one of the most brilliant

1:03:01.530 --> 1:03:03.931
scientists the world has ever known,

1:03:03.931 --> 1:03:06.810
and a great inspiration to me.

1:03:06.810 --> 1:03:08.580
- Is that so?

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:10.230
I always thought Frankenstein
was just some guy

1:03:10.230 --> 1:03:13.063
in the movies who got mixed
up with Abbott and Costello.

1:03:15.100 --> 1:03:19.480
- I'm told I bear a striking
resemblance to Victor,

1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:21.550
wouldn't you agree, Mr...

1:03:21.550 --> 1:03:26.550
- Anvil, Jack Anvil, P.I. at your service.

1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:32.880
Mr...

1:03:34.780 --> 1:03:39.780
- Mortality, Dr. Mortality,
at your service, Mr. Anvil.

1:03:42.770 --> 1:03:47.540
- [Jack] I didn't like the
sound of that name, Mortality.

1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:52.540
It reminded me of death,
and that map of his,

1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:55.040
like some looney from the pages

1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:57.840
of Black Mask or Weird Tales.

1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:00.330
But at that moment, what I thought

1:04:00.330 --> 1:04:03.543
of this bargain basement
Karloff didn't seem to matter.

1:04:12.299 --> 1:04:14.966
- [Dr. Mortality] Yes, yes, yes.

1:04:20.180 --> 1:04:22.008
- Is he the one?

1:04:22.008 --> 1:04:24.240
- The one you've been waiting for?

1:04:24.240 --> 1:04:27.850
- Waiting so long for, my dearest?

1:04:27.850 --> 1:04:28.683
- Dearest?

1:04:29.660 --> 1:04:30.493
You three?

1:04:31.810 --> 1:04:36.023
You're with this creep, all three?

1:04:37.210 --> 1:04:39.553
- Yes, yes, yes, my lovelies.

1:04:40.660 --> 1:04:42.113
He'll do just nicely.

1:04:43.250 --> 1:04:46.643
- Nicely, do what nicely?

1:04:48.150 --> 1:04:51.000
Something wasn't right with this setup.

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.420
I knew that rain or not, I had
to make a beeline outta here.

1:04:55.420 --> 1:04:59.350
Just a few well-aimed shots
with my licensed .38 snub nose

1:04:59.350 --> 1:05:02.660
and I'd be free and out of this madhouse.

1:05:02.660 --> 1:05:06.533
But Mr. Michael Fend had
already done his dirty work.

1:05:08.011 --> 1:05:09.533
- You can't escape, Mr. Anvil.

1:05:10.550 --> 1:05:11.780
The drug that Anna May gave you

1:05:11.780 --> 1:05:13.823
will immobilize you for hours.

1:05:14.780 --> 1:05:19.063
That'll give me just enough
time to preform the operation.

1:05:23.563 --> 1:05:26.240
Mogambo, it's time.

1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:27.850
- As you wish.

1:05:27.850 --> 1:05:30.110
- [Jack] Although I couldn't
move, the gray matter

1:05:30.110 --> 1:05:33.550
in my noggin still
worked like gangbusters.

1:05:33.550 --> 1:05:36.858
Besides, the dolls
seemed to be on my team.

1:05:36.858 --> 1:05:38.650
Maybe they'd grab my heat

1:05:38.650 --> 1:05:41.020
and bail me outta this insane asylum.

1:05:41.020 --> 1:05:42.893
Yeah, maybe.

1:05:45.030 --> 1:05:48.430
So, maybe the China dolls didn't go for me

1:05:48.430 --> 1:05:50.426
as much as I thought.

1:05:50.426 --> 1:05:53.950
It wasn't the first time my
hunch was a little bit off,

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:55.360
or I'd been given the double cross

1:05:55.360 --> 1:05:56.843
by some good looking dame.

1:05:57.840 --> 1:06:01.080
But I was getting the sneaking suspicion

1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:03.183
that this might be the last.

1:06:07.050 --> 1:06:09.133
(grunts)

1:06:12.060 --> 1:06:14.660
I was beginning to
wonder if this craziness

1:06:14.660 --> 1:06:16.810
was just a nightmare.

1:06:16.810 --> 1:06:19.680
The result of that pastrami
sandwich and dill pickle

1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:22.520
that cute waitress served
me back at the diner.

1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:25.946
But if that was the case, Jack Anvil,

1:06:25.946 --> 1:06:30.083
private gumshoe, wasn't laughing.

1:06:30.083 --> 1:06:33.000
(thunder crashing)

1:06:46.959 --> 1:06:49.876
(Gargantus growls)

1:07:13.398 --> 1:07:15.740
I was finally starting to get it.

1:07:15.740 --> 1:07:20.740
That crazy as this seemed,
this was no gosh darned joke.

1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:26.093
- You're wasting your time Mr., Mr. Anvil.

1:07:29.070 --> 1:07:32.993
But uh, I suppose you're
entitled to an explanation.

1:07:44.597 --> 1:07:49.423
Gargantus was a gift from Mogambo's tribe.

1:07:51.060 --> 1:07:53.977
(Gargantus growls)

1:07:56.480 --> 1:07:58.113
I see that my pet likes you,

1:07:59.717 --> 1:08:03.063
but I must apologize for
his uncouth behavior.

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.930
You see, he's hungry,
and I've been too busy

1:08:17.930 --> 1:08:21.130
the last few hours to feed my little pet.

1:08:21.130 --> 1:08:22.370
- [Jack] Little pet?

1:08:22.370 --> 1:08:25.040
More like King Kong's big brat.

1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:28.313
If I ever needed an assist
from Clyde Beatty, this was it.

1:08:29.150 --> 1:08:31.020
I hoped that what they said about gorillas

1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:32.973
being vegetarians was true.

1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:37.240
- But after he's fed, he's
really quite harmless.

1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:41.940
I do hope you like Gargantus
as much as he likes you,

1:08:41.940 --> 1:08:46.383
because Gargantus is
going to be your new home.

1:08:49.220 --> 1:08:52.343
Victor Frankenstein, who's
portrait you so admired,

1:08:53.250 --> 1:08:57.900
once created a living human
being by assembling parts

1:08:57.900 --> 1:09:01.173
of corpses and then bringing alive.

1:09:02.460 --> 1:09:05.113
He came to be known as
Frankenstein's monster.

1:09:06.625 --> 1:09:08.625
(roars)

1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:15.440
Simply put, Mr. Anvil, I'm
going to remove your brain,

1:09:16.100 --> 1:09:20.023
your living brain, and transfer
it into the head of my ape.

1:09:21.610 --> 1:09:24.923
After the operation you're
going to be neither man nor ape,

1:09:26.900 --> 1:09:29.970
but my creation, mine.

1:09:29.970 --> 1:09:32.543
Capable of human thoughts and reasoning,

1:09:33.383 --> 1:09:37.523
but with the strength
and power of a Hercules.

1:09:38.900 --> 1:09:43.690
Oh, the scientific knowledge
that we're gonna glean

1:09:43.690 --> 1:09:45.143
from this experiment.

1:09:46.930 --> 1:09:50.181
Don't worry, Mr. Anvil, I'll be merciful.

1:09:50.181 --> 1:09:55.181
You'll sleep soundly,
painlessly, mercifully,

1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.253
but only for awhile.

1:10:00.870 --> 1:10:02.940
- [Jack] The guy was Section 8,

1:10:02.940 --> 1:10:06.210
but the reason for his
nuttiness wasn't my problem.

1:10:06.210 --> 1:10:08.980
There I was, like some
poor stiff in a mortuary,

1:10:08.980 --> 1:10:11.193
waiting for the undertaker to go to work.

1:10:12.810 --> 1:10:14.223
- Pleasant dreams, hmm?

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:20.673
- [Jack] And then the world disappeared.

1:10:21.844 --> 1:10:24.427
(serene music)

1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:48.310
I may have dreamed of the
three Annas, maybe more.

1:10:48.310 --> 1:10:51.053
All of us marooned on some remote island,

1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:55.307
with them all decked out like
Maria Montez or Dottie Lamour.

1:10:57.076 --> 1:10:58.493
- [All] Hi, Jack.

1:11:01.550 --> 1:11:05.963
- [Jack] And me, the only guy
around for thousands of miles.

1:11:09.714 --> 1:11:12.464
(relaxing music)

1:11:56.891 --> 1:11:59.391
(bird chirps)

1:12:05.910 --> 1:12:09.610
All dreams, especially the best ones,

1:12:09.610 --> 1:12:11.503
can turn into nightmares.

1:12:13.340 --> 1:12:17.943
When I finally woke up, I
wasn't paralyzed anymore,

1:12:19.130 --> 1:12:21.700
but moving wasn't easy.

1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:24.400
As if I'd put on weight
like some fatso let loose

1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:26.640
in an all you can eat bakery.

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.000
My head ached.

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000
There was an empty rumbling in my gut

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:35.650
reminding me of the gunfire I
heard in Normandy back in '44.

1:12:35.650 --> 1:12:39.630
Then I remembered every
confounded gosh darn detail.

1:12:39.630 --> 1:12:42.203
I felt like I needed a
haircut, and I was hungry.

1:12:43.090 --> 1:12:45.423
And so was Gargantus.

1:12:48.380 --> 1:12:51.770
It also finally sunk in
that those Anna babes

1:12:51.770 --> 1:12:54.690
really didn't have a
thing for me after all.

1:12:54.690 --> 1:12:57.203
What did they see in Dr. Mortality?

1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:03.623
Guess I will never understand
the opposite gender.

1:13:05.010 --> 1:13:08.163
Or should that be species?

1:13:09.450 --> 1:13:12.660
Yeah, I was hungry, or Gargantus was.

1:13:12.660 --> 1:13:15.800
Maybe the food wasn't
a Brown Derby T-bone,

1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.630
but somehow, I was like a starving man

1:13:18.630 --> 1:13:21.170
at a free smorgasbord.

1:13:21.170 --> 1:13:24.993
And yeah, I'd become vegetarian.

1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:30.550
And you know, as long as Dr.
Mortality and his looney crew

1:13:30.550 --> 1:13:35.240
continued to feed me, and
occasionally clean out my mess,

1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:40.610
what more could any ape,
human brain or not, ask for?

1:13:40.610 --> 1:13:45.113
So as far as Jack Anvil,
former P.I. was concerned,

1:13:45.990 --> 1:13:49.793
the case of the mad house
of death was closed.

1:13:51.170 --> 1:13:55.715
But only one thing I
still couldn't understand.

1:13:55.715 --> 1:13:59.660
Those three China dolls, they really were

1:13:59.660 --> 1:14:01.920
that creep's girlfriends?

1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:05.260
Heck, I shoulda got more
chummy with that waitress

1:14:05.260 --> 1:14:06.493
back at the diner.

1:14:07.550 --> 1:14:08.613
I knew she liked me.

1:14:09.932 --> 1:14:12.499
(thunder crashes)

1:14:12.499 --> 1:14:14.916
(wolf howls)

1:14:26.228 --> 1:14:28.728
(eerie music)

1:14:42.350 --> 1:14:44.993
- I call upon you, Victor Frankenstein,

1:14:46.920 --> 1:14:49.923
that your immortal spirit guides my hands.

1:15:17.550 --> 1:15:20.374
When you awaken in your new body,

1:15:20.374 --> 1:15:24.073
all memory of your former
life will be wiped clean,

1:15:25.010 --> 1:15:28.053
and you will obey only me.

1:15:28.970 --> 1:15:32.223
You will have the strength
of many men, my creation,

1:15:33.570 --> 1:15:34.987
and live forever.

1:15:47.318 --> 1:15:50.235
(electric buzzing)

1:15:58.228 --> 1:16:01.061
(accordion music)

1:16:05.250 --> 1:16:08.583
(indistinct whispering)

1:16:14.470 --> 1:16:16.023
- Here you go, Radu.

1:16:16.023 --> 1:16:18.004
Have a good evening.

1:16:18.004 --> 1:16:20.593
- As well as I can, Adelina,
babysitting the dead.

1:16:21.530 --> 1:16:23.230
Make that undead.

1:16:23.230 --> 1:16:25.440
- Wine, our best, and two glasses.

1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:26.690
- Coming right up, Crina.

1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:33.740
- Can you get you gentlemen
anything else to drink?

1:16:33.740 --> 1:16:34.903
- Or maybe a couple?

1:16:36.223 --> 1:16:38.910
- Claudiu, only drinks
are for sale tonight.

1:16:38.910 --> 1:16:39.743
- Tomorrow night?

1:16:39.743 --> 1:16:41.960
- Guess you'll have to
come back to find out.

1:16:43.719 --> 1:16:45.550
- Hm, just be wary of--

1:16:45.550 --> 1:16:46.627
- I can handle him.

1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:52.570
- And your name is Karnstein,
Dr. Heinrich Karnstein.

1:16:52.570 --> 1:16:54.470
Your family once lived in Switzerland.

1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:58.370
- Well I spent most of
my youth in England,

1:16:58.370 --> 1:17:00.143
where I preformed all my research.

1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:04.323
- Welcome to Transylvania, doc.

1:17:05.290 --> 1:17:07.773
- I prefer doctor, if
you don't mind, Carl.

1:17:11.689 --> 1:17:13.500
- Got any money, doc?

1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:14.333
- Please.

1:17:15.497 --> 1:17:16.860
Thank you.

1:17:16.860 --> 1:17:17.693
- [Crina] Thank you, sir.

1:17:17.693 --> 1:17:19.260
- Yes, thank you doctor.

1:17:31.939 --> 1:17:33.317
- Good night.

1:17:33.317 --> 1:17:34.934
- Good night, Radu.

1:17:34.934 --> 1:17:35.767
- Come back soon.

1:17:35.767 --> 1:17:36.953
- I will, you can be sure.

1:17:42.590 --> 1:17:43.613
- Please, Carl.

1:17:46.450 --> 1:17:48.650
- We'll have the bottle, thank you.

1:17:48.650 --> 1:17:50.150
- [Crina] Thank you, kind sir.

1:17:57.830 --> 1:17:59.060
- Ah, Karnstein?

1:18:01.340 --> 1:18:02.969
Dr. Karnstein?

1:18:02.969 --> 1:18:04.262
- Hm?

1:18:04.262 --> 1:18:06.913
Oh, I'm sorry Carl, I was miles away.

1:18:07.750 --> 1:18:10.563
I was thinking what a wonderful
province you have here.

1:18:11.576 --> 1:18:14.820
Mountains, rivers, forest,

1:18:14.820 --> 1:18:17.843
but above all you have opportunity.

1:18:19.670 --> 1:18:23.360
- I've lived here all my
life and I've yet to see one,

1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:26.540
as you put it, opportunity.

1:18:26.540 --> 1:18:30.630
But someday I hope to escape to America.

1:18:30.630 --> 1:18:33.720
I mean the music, and I think the girls

1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:36.361
there are called chicks.

1:18:36.361 --> 1:18:39.943
They're more friendly
then some of our girls.

1:18:44.870 --> 1:18:45.833
Shall we replenish?

1:18:48.922 --> 1:18:50.093
- Thank you.

1:18:50.093 --> 1:18:53.840
And you believe dressing up
as that mumbling American

1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:55.663
film actor will help you get there?

1:18:56.700 --> 1:18:59.850
Or at least catch the eye
of a pretty bar maid, hmm?

1:18:59.850 --> 1:19:02.060
- I mean, it can't hurt.

1:19:02.060 --> 1:19:05.910
Besides I like the, the
feel of these threads.

1:19:05.910 --> 1:19:10.270
Imported, used, from the States.

1:19:10.270 --> 1:19:13.970
- Tell me Carl, the castle I saw on my way

1:19:13.970 --> 1:19:16.360
to the village this afternoon.

1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:19.040
Might you know if it's for purchase?

1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:21.900
- Probably is, but you'll
have to talk to the mayor.

1:19:21.900 --> 1:19:24.950
Nobody's lived in that ancient
dump for over 100 years.

1:19:24.950 --> 1:19:28.723
Nobody even goes near
it, too many old rumors.

1:19:29.895 --> 1:19:33.193
- Perfect, splendid.

1:19:34.850 --> 1:19:37.213
- You're not thinking of
buying that old eyesore?

1:19:43.736 --> 1:19:44.933
Replenish?

1:19:52.952 --> 1:19:55.619
(intense music)

1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:02.370
- To think, the locals say
this place was once home

1:20:02.370 --> 1:20:03.933
to a den of vampires.

1:20:05.330 --> 1:20:08.570
Very hard to believe,
I mean we're not living

1:20:08.570 --> 1:20:11.543
in 19th century Transylvania.

1:20:12.420 --> 1:20:15.790
You see, my friend, I deal only in fact,

1:20:15.790 --> 1:20:18.380
not idiotic superstition.

1:20:18.380 --> 1:20:22.320
- You know, some idiots
still believe like,

1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:25.233
the old legends, and they
refuse to go near this place.

1:20:26.220 --> 1:20:31.020
- Good, then they won't pester
me when I work, will they?

1:20:31.020 --> 1:20:35.913
- Doctor, you still haven't
told me, what kind of work?

1:20:40.860 --> 1:20:45.860
- Carl, have you ever heard of
the name Victor Frankenstein?

1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:48.620
- Frankenstein, of course.

1:20:48.620 --> 1:20:51.533
Who hasn't, like the old
Hollywood films, right?

1:20:52.370 --> 1:20:55.300
- Hmm, Victor Frankenstein
was more than just

1:20:55.300 --> 1:20:57.453
a character from old films.

1:20:58.730 --> 1:21:02.830
He was a real person who actually existed,

1:21:02.830 --> 1:21:04.823
and he had a wondrous dream.

1:21:06.150 --> 1:21:10.363
A dream less enlightened
people might call insanity.

1:21:11.980 --> 1:21:16.980
To steal from nature her
most precious secret,

1:21:17.330 --> 1:21:19.773
the secret of eternal life.

1:21:22.420 --> 1:21:25.663
Victor Frankenstein created a living man.

1:21:27.450 --> 1:21:32.450
A body he made piece by piece
from corpses he acquired

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:35.890
from the graveyards, the
morgue, the slaughterhouse,

1:21:35.890 --> 1:21:38.020
wherever he could find them.

1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:41.570
- Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

1:21:41.570 --> 1:21:46.100
- As will you, Carl,
when in this very room

1:21:46.100 --> 1:21:51.100
I create Victor Frankenstein's
great experiment again.

1:21:53.270 --> 1:21:56.180
- That's crazy man. (chuckles)

1:21:56.180 --> 1:21:57.013
- Is it, Carl?

1:21:58.550 --> 1:21:59.563
Is it crazy?

1:22:01.260 --> 1:22:04.350
My family name was once Frankenstein,

1:22:04.350 --> 1:22:07.523
modified by an ancestor
to avoid the stigma.

1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:12.730
Is it crazy my mother and
father went to their grave

1:22:12.730 --> 1:22:15.240
fearing their only son would be tainted

1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:17.213
by the Frankenstein gene?

1:22:18.499 --> 1:22:21.510
The gene that crops up
every generation or so,

1:22:21.510 --> 1:22:24.063
among members of the
Frankenstein bloodline.

1:22:25.010 --> 1:22:29.220
You see, over the years
I've collected copies

1:22:29.220 --> 1:22:32.330
of Victor Frankenstein's notes,

1:22:32.330 --> 1:22:34.093
some from the British museum.

1:22:36.170 --> 1:22:40.360
By combining his ideas
with my own techniques,

1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:44.650
including atomic energy,
I intend to create

1:22:44.650 --> 1:22:46.733
my own living man.

1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:51.930
But you see, unlike
Frankenstein's so-called monster,

1:22:51.930 --> 1:22:56.930
one totally dominated by my will.

1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.273
The perfect superhuman slave.

1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:04.653
Well, Carl, now what do you say?

1:23:05.727 --> 1:23:08.430
- Like I said before, you're cracked.

1:23:08.430 --> 1:23:11.930
You're completely wacko. (chuckles)

1:23:25.610 --> 1:23:29.150
- Our last of this vintage, I'm sorry.

1:23:29.150 --> 1:23:30.860
- And alas, this will have to be our final

1:23:30.860 --> 1:23:32.710
drink of the evening.

1:23:32.710 --> 1:23:33.750
Dorina, isn't it?

1:23:33.750 --> 1:23:34.893
- It is, yes.

1:23:35.740 --> 1:23:37.300
- [Heinrich] Beautiful name.

1:23:37.300 --> 1:23:38.133
- Thank you.

1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:41.853
Okay, well you boys enjoy.

1:23:45.260 --> 1:23:48.633
- You, you're going to rob graves.

1:23:50.450 --> 1:23:53.310
Hey, don't worry doctor,
no other customers

1:23:53.310 --> 1:23:55.183
to overhear you past sunset.

1:23:57.729 --> 1:24:01.523
- We, Carl, we are going to rob graves.

1:24:03.119 --> 1:24:04.560
- Yeah, now I know you're nuts.

1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:08.946
I ain't stealing no bodies,
I ain't no body snitcher.

1:24:08.946 --> 1:24:10.983
- The word is snatcher, Carl.

1:24:12.500 --> 1:24:13.740
I've learned a lot about you

1:24:13.740 --> 1:24:16.509
since my arrival in Transylvania.

1:24:16.509 --> 1:24:20.930
I know you need money, I
know you'd do almost anything

1:24:20.930 --> 1:24:23.550
to get away from this backward province.

1:24:23.550 --> 1:24:27.170
To go someplace where
you could enjoy success,

1:24:27.170 --> 1:24:31.023
fortune, and perhaps the
finer things in life,

1:24:32.550 --> 1:24:33.400
if you had money.

1:24:34.850 --> 1:24:37.723
Besides, I need an assistant.

1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:41.293
- I'm listening.

1:24:43.170 --> 1:24:46.670
- Once our experiment is
completed and I publish,

1:24:46.670 --> 1:24:49.493
you, Carl, will share in all the glory.

1:24:50.370 --> 1:24:54.230
Imagine what an impression
you'll make on those bar maids.

1:24:54.230 --> 1:24:57.510
And all those American chicks, as you say,

1:24:57.510 --> 1:24:59.860
especially if you had
the money, the notoriety.

1:25:01.630 --> 1:25:03.683
Well, my friend?

1:25:05.150 --> 1:25:05.983
Colleague?

1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:10.993
Are you with me?

1:25:15.069 --> 1:25:16.652
- [Both] Replenish.

1:25:18.269 --> 1:25:20.769
(eerie music)

1:26:02.456 --> 1:26:05.289
(bats chattering)

1:26:17.980 --> 1:26:20.540
- What if somebody sees us?

1:26:20.540 --> 1:26:22.120
- Who, Carl?

1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:26.153
All the townspeople hiding
in their homes from vampires?

1:26:26.153 --> 1:26:27.817
I don't think so.

1:26:27.817 --> 1:26:29.410
- I don't know, I can't
put my finger on it

1:26:29.410 --> 1:26:30.580
but something doesn't feel right--

1:26:30.580 --> 1:26:32.800
- Quit whining, and get on with it.

1:26:40.506 --> 1:26:42.673
- What are you doing here?

1:26:44.617 --> 1:26:47.660
- And who might you be,
sir, visiting a cemetery

1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:49.500
at this late hour?

1:26:49.500 --> 1:26:51.450
- The caretaker of these
sanctified grounds,

1:26:51.450 --> 1:26:52.900
if it's any of your business.

1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:58.290
More important, don't
you know where you are?

1:26:58.290 --> 1:27:01.920
- Yes, in a musty tomb
in an old graveyard.

1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:04.116
- What else is there to know?

1:27:04.116 --> 1:27:07.311
- This isn't just any graveyard.

1:27:07.311 --> 1:27:11.061
This ground is hallowed,
sanctified long ago.

1:27:12.190 --> 1:27:13.240
Don't you understand?

1:27:14.476 --> 1:27:16.340
This is where it all began.

1:27:16.340 --> 1:27:17.173
What're you doing--

1:27:22.748 --> 1:27:25.165
(Carl gasps)

1:27:34.922 --> 1:27:38.172
- You, you robbing graves is one thing,

1:27:39.373 --> 1:27:43.420
but, but you are a doctor, a murderer!

1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:45.203
- And you are an accessory, Carl.

1:27:46.130 --> 1:27:48.780
Your fingerprints are
on the murder weapon.

1:27:48.780 --> 1:27:50.450
I suggest you remember that.

1:27:52.323 --> 1:27:53.910
And if you need further persuasion,

1:27:53.910 --> 1:27:57.500
I assure you my
marksmanship is impeccable.

1:27:57.500 --> 1:28:00.813
Now, shall we get back to work?

1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:05.143
- The hinges are rusted,
we don't need the crowbar.

1:28:24.550 --> 1:28:25.813
- Such preservation.

1:28:27.810 --> 1:28:29.173
The skin, pliable.

1:28:30.750 --> 1:28:32.903
It's like it was buried yesterday.

1:28:42.860 --> 1:28:46.323
Then it's true, what
I've read about the soil.

1:28:49.107 --> 1:28:52.020
And from the age of this
coffin and the clothing,

1:28:52.020 --> 1:28:55.250
this fellow must have
been here for a long time.

1:28:55.250 --> 1:28:58.370
- But this body, this body
wasn't buried in the ground.

1:28:58.370 --> 1:29:00.600
- There's dirt inside
the coffin, you fool,

1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:02.507
obviously enough to do its work.

1:29:02.507 --> 1:29:05.280
- You know what the villagers
would say about this?

1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:09.123
- Utter rubbish, now will
you help me get on with this?

1:29:55.843 --> 1:29:58.640
- I don't get what's so cool about this.

1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:00.450
- About what, Carl?

1:30:00.450 --> 1:30:03.823
- This, it seems like regular dirt to me.

1:30:05.011 --> 1:30:06.998
- I'm afraid a geological analysis

1:30:06.998 --> 1:30:09.173
will have to wait its turn.

1:30:10.420 --> 1:30:13.990
As did Victor Frankenstein,
we'll use only the best,

1:30:13.990 --> 1:30:16.023
most appropriate parts.

1:30:17.320 --> 1:30:21.583
Strongest arms, most
powerful torso, and so forth.

1:30:24.240 --> 1:30:26.703
Well what're you just
standing there for, boy?

1:30:27.900 --> 1:30:29.303
We've much work to do.

1:31:15.578 --> 1:31:16.411
- Radu!

1:31:37.833 --> 1:31:40.833
(vocalizes in fear)

1:31:54.893 --> 1:31:56.193
- Careful with that, Carl.

1:31:57.562 --> 1:31:59.710
If there's any damage and
I have to send to London

1:31:59.710 --> 1:32:02.963
for a replacement, it will set
our work back considerably.

1:32:05.625 --> 1:32:09.337
Those vintage pieces are
irreplaceable, you know.

1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:26.896
- Can I get you something,

1:32:26.896 --> 1:32:28.031
Miklos?
- I saw yet another, yes,

1:32:28.031 --> 1:32:29.781
in the dead of night.

1:32:31.995 --> 1:32:32.828
- Miklos.

1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:36.430
- Another truck, bringing more machines

1:32:36.430 --> 1:32:38.440
up to that damned castle.

1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:41.393
Machines probably built
by Lucifer himself.

1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:46.080
- What's going on, Adelina?

1:32:46.080 --> 1:32:48.270
- I've never seen the
men like this before.

1:32:48.270 --> 1:32:49.703
- Do they really believe in, you know,

1:32:49.703 --> 1:32:51.870
like in this day and age?

1:32:51.870 --> 1:32:55.370
- I mean, I may not believe in
them, but I'm afraid of them.

1:32:55.370 --> 1:32:58.691
- I say we've wasted enough time.

1:32:58.691 --> 1:33:01.103
- Who's this Dr. Karnstein, anyway?

1:33:01.960 --> 1:33:05.660
That name, wasn't there a
vampire named Karnstein?

1:33:05.660 --> 1:33:08.670
And what does he need with
all those damned machines?

1:33:08.670 --> 1:33:11.623
- Maybe they're building an atomic bomb.

1:33:12.818 --> 1:33:14.260
- Oh, no.

1:33:14.260 --> 1:33:15.530
- I don't think so.
- No.

1:33:15.530 --> 1:33:17.510
- There is more, Dinu.

1:33:17.510 --> 1:33:18.940
- What is it, Miklos?

1:33:18.940 --> 1:33:23.630
- The cemetery gate, the
chain and lock, broken.

1:33:23.630 --> 1:33:24.590
- Broken?

1:33:24.590 --> 1:33:26.520
- Wait a minute, when
was the last time anyone

1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:28.300
saw the caretaker?

1:33:28.300 --> 1:33:29.540
- Ah.

1:33:29.540 --> 1:33:32.193
- I haven't seen Radu in weeks.

1:33:32.193 --> 1:33:34.770
- It's not like Radu to miss having a beer

1:33:34.770 --> 1:33:37.200
or two each Saturday afternoon.

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:38.360
- Oh, I miss Radu.

1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:39.193
- Yeah.

1:33:39.193 --> 1:33:40.540
- He tipped well.

1:33:40.540 --> 1:33:41.723
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

1:33:43.171 --> 1:33:45.933
- And this, do you recognize it?

1:33:46.940 --> 1:33:48.490
- You sure, where'd you find it?

1:33:48.490 --> 1:33:49.323
Take us there.

1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:52.130
- Come, let's go.

1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:00.317
- Wait, wait, you, you may
need my help, the Lord's help!

1:34:14.573 --> 1:34:17.490
(quiet whispering)

1:34:59.024 --> 1:35:03.231
(speaks foreign language)

1:35:03.231 --> 1:35:04.064
- Amen.

1:35:04.064 --> 1:35:05.147
- [All] Amen.

1:35:08.590 --> 1:35:10.911
- I've got to hand it to ya, doc.

1:35:10.911 --> 1:35:14.333
Even though I don't really
approve what you're doing,

1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:16.763
you've done a very cool job.

1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:21.580
Time to replenish.

1:35:23.980 --> 1:35:28.473
- No, Carl, we have done a very cool job.

1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:34.373
But your contribution to this
project is far from over yet.

1:35:35.370 --> 1:35:39.220
You see, I need one
more important component

1:35:39.220 --> 1:35:40.313
for my creation.

1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.880
- Surely, one of those stiffs must have--

1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:54.880
- No, the brain needs
to be fresh, healthy.

1:35:54.890 --> 1:35:58.403
The brain of someone recently dead.

1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:02.110
- How are you gonna...

1:36:04.430 --> 1:36:07.973
No, I won't be involved in another murder.

1:36:09.310 --> 1:36:10.760
- You don't have to be, Carl,

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:13.940
at least not in the way you think.

1:36:39.730 --> 1:36:42.400
It's no good trying to move, Carl.

1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:46.310
The bullet lodged in your
spine, you're paralyzed.

1:36:46.310 --> 1:36:50.073
But don't worry, I won't let you die.

1:36:50.073 --> 1:36:51.693
Not yet, anyway.

1:36:53.013 --> 1:36:53.846
- Why?

1:36:54.780 --> 1:36:57.950
- I no longer need your assistance, Carl,

1:36:57.950 --> 1:37:01.893
but your brain, your
brain is another matter.

1:37:02.970 --> 1:37:04.420
A gray matter, you might say.

1:37:06.270 --> 1:37:07.103
- Doctor.

1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:09.833
Doctor!

1:37:17.220 --> 1:37:18.053
Doc.

1:37:24.530 --> 1:37:25.363
Doc.

1:37:32.100 --> 1:37:34.600
- I trust the morphine helped, Carl.

1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:38.862
Don't worry now, you won't feel a thing.

1:37:38.862 --> 1:37:41.862
(power tool buzzes)

1:38:27.123 --> 1:38:29.873
(wet squelching)

1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:36.310
- First this Karnstein moves into a place

1:38:36.310 --> 1:38:39.336
our village has shunned for years.

1:38:39.336 --> 1:38:41.680
- And now the cemetery, violated.

1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:46.270
Graves opened, tombs desecrated,
the bodies God knows where.

1:38:46.270 --> 1:38:48.420
Sorry, Father Florescu.

1:38:48.420 --> 1:38:51.600
And now poor Radu, murdered.

1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:53.400
- We can't go to the police

1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:55.580
or the secure dottie with just that.

1:38:55.580 --> 1:38:57.800
- We do what our forefathers did.

1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:01.170
Karnstein moved into a castle
once occupied by the undead.

1:39:01.170 --> 1:39:03.090
Tonight is a full moon.

1:39:03.090 --> 1:39:05.510
It's said that a full moon
can revive the undead,

1:39:05.510 --> 1:39:07.280
even after they've been put to rest.

1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:09.823
- Aye, that's what the legends say.

1:39:09.823 --> 1:39:11.680
- There's one tonight.

1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:16.680
- Maybe this Dr. Karnstein is
one of those foul creatures.

1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:19.660
- Yes, I say he's a vampire.

1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:21.780
- Well, we know how to deal with them.

1:39:21.780 --> 1:39:25.051
- No, that would be murder, a grave sin.

1:39:25.051 --> 1:39:28.271
Our forbearers did not take
such blasphemous steps.

1:39:28.271 --> 1:39:30.640
An archbishop consecrated the ground--

1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:33.820
- What if it's been
unsanctified, desecrated?

1:39:33.820 --> 1:39:37.080
- No, I, I can't condone
this, I can't be a part of it.

1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:40.650
- We'll discuss it later,
Father, in a confessional.

1:39:40.650 --> 1:39:41.493
- Yeah!

1:39:47.451 --> 1:39:51.040
- Say I'm crazy, but I can't miss this.

1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:52.723
Ladies, take over for me.

1:39:56.776 --> 1:39:59.183
- She's not leaving me behind.

1:40:02.100 --> 1:40:03.280
- Well me neither.

1:40:33.306 --> 1:40:36.223
(electric buzzing)

1:41:43.197 --> 1:41:45.447
(sniffing)

1:42:55.970 --> 1:42:59.543
- My slave, you live.

1:43:08.732 --> 1:43:10.815
(laughs)

1:43:12.530 --> 1:43:13.853
Now, can you talk?

1:43:15.385 --> 1:43:20.385
Go on, try.

1:43:40.507 --> 1:43:45.053
I command you, acknowledge your master.

1:43:49.596 --> 1:43:50.596
- Karnstein.

1:43:58.897 --> 1:44:02.514
(laughs gleefully)

1:44:02.514 --> 1:44:03.347
Doc!

1:44:05.136 --> 1:44:06.886
- Carl, you remember?

1:44:10.155 --> 1:44:11.072
- Remember?

1:44:13.098 --> 1:44:14.265
I, we, thirst.

1:44:18.235 --> 1:44:22.300
- But I don't understand.

1:44:22.300 --> 1:44:24.967
(crowd yelling)

1:44:28.689 --> 1:44:32.626
- [Man] Kill the vampire!

1:44:32.626 --> 1:44:34.868
- [Man] Shoot the latch, shoot the latch!

1:44:34.868 --> 1:44:37.451
(crowd cheers)

1:44:39.693 --> 1:44:42.026
- Get him, get him, get him!

1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:47.863
- Carl, you must obey me.

1:44:49.390 --> 1:44:51.593
You must acknowledge your master.

1:44:53.220 --> 1:44:55.750
You must protect me from them.

1:44:58.691 --> 1:45:00.191
Do you understand?

1:45:03.990 --> 1:45:04.823
Kill them!

1:45:20.033 --> 1:45:20.866
Oh my God!

1:45:28.388 --> 1:45:31.305
(Heinrich gurgles)

1:45:38.538 --> 1:45:40.390
- Get him.
- There he is.

1:45:40.390 --> 1:45:41.223
- Get him.

1:45:49.472 --> 1:45:50.472
- Replenish.

1:45:53.112 --> 1:45:54.112
- Good lord!

1:46:15.350 --> 1:46:20.350
- [Narrator] He was soon lost
in darkness and distance.
