All right, take a break, girls.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.962
- Ives, good work.
- So proud of you.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.921
- Let's see what you got
so far.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.532
Yeah, this is what we want.

12:30.575 --> 12:31.794
- Ivy?

12:31.838 --> 12:34.231
Can I talk to you?
- Do I know you?

12:34.275 --> 12:36.581
- I'm a police officer.
Kat Tamin.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.584
- What, did my dad send you?
- Yeah, he did.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.804
- Okay, my little sister
is lying.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.675
I'm a model,
and I got to get back to work.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.068
- Hey, Ivy,

12:45.112 --> 12:46.983
I don't care what you've
been telling your father.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.419
I went through your computer.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.812
We both know what's really
going on here.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.118
- You did what?

12:51.161 --> 12:52.467
Okay, I don't need to talk
to you.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.990
- Yes, you do,

12:54.034 --> 12:55.470
or I'm going to tell
the people that you work for

12:55.513 --> 12:59.082
you already did,
and that you're giving them up.

12:59.126 --> 13:03.086
- No, don't do that.
- I can, and I will.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.873
- Ivy.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.396
Everything okay?

13:08.439 --> 13:10.964
- All fine, Granya.
- Who's this?

13:11.965 --> 13:14.315
- Kitty Bucci.
I'm Ivy's aunt.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.708
Yeah, I just wanted to come by
and see for myself

13:16.752 --> 13:18.362
what all this modeling
was about.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.365
It's so exciting, isn't it?
- We love Ivy.

13:21.409 --> 13:24.847
- Could you and I speak
privately?

13:24.891 --> 13:27.110
- Ivy, they're waiting for you.

13:29.852 --> 13:33.290
She's such a nice girl.
Well-behaved.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.857
- You mean when the men
pass her around,

13:34.901 --> 13:37.120
and she does whatever they ask?

13:37.164 --> 13:39.296
- Excuse me?
- Cut the crap, Granya.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.473
I know what's going on.
You're taking care of Ivy.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.824
You've got to take care
of me too.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.522
- That's something
we can talk about.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.961
- Is that your boss, Steve?

13:52.005 --> 13:54.834
He know my brother's an ex-cop?

13:54.877 --> 13:56.487
It would be a real good idea
for Steve

13:56.531 --> 13:59.273
to get Ivy's dad
and me on his side.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.755
- Why don't I
introduce you two?

14:03.799 --> 14:06.367
I'm sure he can
allay your concerns.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.500
Steve...

14:09.544 --> 14:11.285
You have a special visitor.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.635
- Steve Getz,
good to meet you.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.028
- What is Kat doing?

14:15.071 --> 14:17.465
Captain said to suss out
the gig, talk to Ivy.

14:17.508 --> 14:20.468
- She's calling an audible.
- But Getz is smart.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.035
If he makes her, this--
this case is blown

14:22.078 --> 14:23.514
before we even open it.

14:23.558 --> 14:24.994
- So what do you want me to do,
shoot her?

14:25.038 --> 14:26.387
- You're her sergeant.
Reel her in.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.867
- I'll talk to her.
- Really, will ya?

14:27.910 --> 14:30.565
- Later.
Let her play this out.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.436
- All right.

14:33.046 --> 14:40.314
♪

14:46.233 --> 14:46.624
.

14:46.668 --> 14:49.801
- Kitty mentioned
she used to be a runway model.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.282
- I knew that
without you telling me.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.718
- This is Granya Marcil,

14:53.762 --> 14:55.155
Steve Getz's
sometime girlfriend

14:55.198 --> 14:56.591
and company talent scout.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.810
- You mean his procurer?
- Seems like it.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.422
Told her I wanted in on the
action, and she didn't blink.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.337
- You approached her?

15:03.380 --> 15:05.252
- Yeah, Kat kind of
went off book,

15:05.295 --> 15:08.777
but she did get an invitation
to Getz's townhouse tonight.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.605
- I saw an opening,
and I went with my gut.

15:10.648 --> 15:11.780
- Next time, don't.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.043
It worked out this time,
but, Kat,

15:14.087 --> 15:16.132
you could have just as easily
blown up the case

15:16.176 --> 15:18.961
or gotten yourself shot.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.180
- Copy that.

15:20.223 --> 15:23.096
- For the record,
Getz is not only wealthy,

15:23.139 --> 15:25.663
he's in tight with
the New York power players.

15:25.707 --> 15:28.231
Politicians, tech founders,
athletes.

15:28.275 --> 15:32.061
GimmieThatBody is one of dozens
of retail chains that he owns.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.586
Six residences,
private islands, private jets--

15:35.630 --> 15:38.067
- So your average billionaire.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.504
Look, you're already in,

15:40.548 --> 15:42.593
so get Granya on tape.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.508
Talk to doormen,
sit on the house,

15:44.552 --> 15:45.770
follow the girls.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.817
We have to hit him
from every angle.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.083
- If you're trying to arrest
Steve, that'll never happen.

15:54.127 --> 15:57.434
He's too smart.
- They all are.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.133
- Ivy, Kitty,
so glad you could come.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.614
- The girl's a regular.
The tall one, she's new.

16:03.658 --> 16:04.964
A little mature for Getz.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.618
- What's his type?
- Candy stripers.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.316
I've been working security
here,

16:09.359 --> 16:10.317
girls coming and going
all hours.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.014
It's like food deliveries.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.190
- Yeah, do you ever see Getz
do anything with the girls?

16:14.234 --> 16:15.713
I mean, physically.

16:15.757 --> 16:18.629
- If I did, you'd be
fingerprinting me.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.416
- This place is beyond amazing.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.984
I thought that you said
there was a party tonight.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.682
- It starts later.
How about a tour?

16:27.725 --> 16:29.162
- Homework to do?

16:29.205 --> 16:31.468
Teenagers,
you've got to ride 'em.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.731
Oh, wow.
- It's not real gold.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.038
- Oh.
[chuckles]

16:36.082 --> 16:39.302
Ivy mentioned that Mr. Getz
has a state-of-the-art gym.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.609
I'd love to check it out.
- Not gonna happen.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.263
It's Steve's private area.

16:43.306 --> 16:46.570
- Ivy knows all about
his private area.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.094
- Let's talk.
- Mm.

16:48.137 --> 16:52.359
- So, Kitty, we appreciate
your interest in Ivy.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.578
- And?

16:54.622 --> 16:57.059
- This is how it's going
to work: ten grand.

16:57.103 --> 17:00.367
A one-time finder's fee for you
and your brother.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.500
- That seems fair.
- You can take Ivy home now.

17:03.544 --> 17:06.764
The next time she comes,
it's without you.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.463
- So, let's forget about
my brother for a second.

17:09.506 --> 17:13.162
You mentioned a finder's fee.
If I were to find more girls...

17:13.206 --> 17:15.077
- We're not really hiring
at the moment.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.209
- Too bad.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.515
I'm a Catholic school
social worker.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.909
The neglect in some
of these homes,

17:20.952 --> 17:23.259
these sweet, pretty girls...

17:23.303 --> 17:27.046
Steve might be able to make a
real difference in their lives.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.267
- You know his type.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.707
Don't waste my time.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.065
- Thanks to you,
I just lost 500 bucks.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.718
Thanks, Dad.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.068
- You arrest the guy?

17:49.111 --> 17:50.330
- Frank, you know
how this works.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.548
- I do know how this works.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.289
The DA's afraid
to go after him.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.118
- We've got an ADA on our side.
He used to be a cop.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.859
- Our Captain just wants to
hit him from every angle.

17:57.902 --> 18:00.862
- Okay?
We will take care of this.

18:00.905 --> 18:04.126
- Good, 'cause if you don't,
I will.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.956
♪

18:07.999 --> 18:10.132
- So these are the first three
girls that we talked to.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.829
There's a dozen more
that we're tracking down.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.570
- I get it,
but none of these three

18:13.614 --> 18:15.311
are willing to testify, right?

18:15.355 --> 18:18.401
- Getz bought Palmer's
grandfather a new Cadillac.

18:18.445 --> 18:22.013
- And Sarah's closets are full
of Prada, Louboutin, Gucci.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.754
- Okay, what about this one?
Any luck?

18:23.798 --> 18:25.713
- Okay, that's Tessa,
so her story is,

18:25.756 --> 18:28.411
Getz was a gentleman
until her 17th birthday.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.326
He's paying for her college.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.938
We do have Granya on tape.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.637
- Yeah, which implicates her
a lot more than him.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.073
What about Ivy?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.770
- Okay, so Ivy's still mad
at her father,

18:39.814 --> 18:41.163
so she's siding with Getz.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.383
- So we have no
complaining witnesses.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.124
- We have a pattern here.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.256
- Yeah, of teenage girls going
in and out of his townhouse,

18:47.300 --> 18:49.563
which he will claim
are photo shoots

18:49.606 --> 18:50.955
and launch parties.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.175
- Milly and her father
are willing to testify.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.177
- To what?
That he's a sleaze?

18:55.221 --> 18:56.613
Look, I feel for these people,
but legally,

18:56.657 --> 18:57.919
there's no there here.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.268
Until one of the victims
flips on Getz,

18:59.312 --> 19:01.966
I can't take a crowbar
to his front door.

19:02.010 --> 19:05.100
- Any other advice, Counselor?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.146
- Figure it out.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.674
- So we keep looking
for more girls.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.806
We bring Granya in.
- Or...

19:15.850 --> 19:18.461
We go directly to Getz.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.984
This guy is arrogant.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.639
Maybe there's a way
that he implicates himself

19:22.683 --> 19:23.814
without realizing it.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.294
- You think he's just gonna
come in?

19:25.338 --> 19:28.079
- No. We have to get inside
his Boyd Cycle.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.865
- His what?
- It's a Chief Garland thing.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.172
We have to catch Getz
off guard,

19:33.215 --> 19:35.217
not on his turf, you know--

19:35.261 --> 19:38.089
throw off his
decision-making process.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.354
- Okay. Chief have any idea
where that might be?

19:44.792 --> 19:47.055
- No, but I do.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.494
- Paige, we have some guests
flying in.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.453
Get some movie theater candy.
[urinating]

19:53.496 --> 19:56.325
Maybe some edibles
while you're at it.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.501
- Ah, told you.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.024
- This is the men's room.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.765
- Well, we looked for you
in the little girls' room,

20:01.809 --> 20:03.637
but they told us
you were in here.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.247
- Good place to talk to you,
Mr. Getz?

20:05.291 --> 20:06.988
- Am I under arrest?

20:07.031 --> 20:09.860
- Not if you come with us
voluntarily.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.688
- Paige, I'm being harassed.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.560
Call Abrams,
tell him to meet me at--

20:13.603 --> 20:16.258
- SVU. Special Victims.
Let's go.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.217
- Would you mind
if I zip up first,

20:18.260 --> 20:20.828
or you want to do that for me,
sweetheart?

20:20.871 --> 20:23.004
- Hard pass.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.745
Wash your hands, sweetie.

20:36.626 --> 20:36.844
.

20:36.887 --> 20:39.455
- What is this, neighbors
complaining about my parties?

20:39.499 --> 20:40.456
- Well, it's more like
the neighbors

20:40.500 --> 20:43.807
worried about your guests.

20:43.851 --> 20:48.159
Young teenage girls,
coming and going at all hours?

20:48.203 --> 20:49.900
- You know who I am.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.860
I run a modeling agency.
- Oh, so they were modeling.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.470
- Really?
At 2:00 a.m.?

20:54.514 --> 20:56.690
- Well, sometimes they're
guests at company parties.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.692
These young models
all have parental permission.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.824
They're contracted employees
on a payroll.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.349
We follow all state-mandated
working conditions.

21:03.392 --> 21:06.047
- Then why does he pay 'em cash
and give gifts?

21:06.090 --> 21:08.267
- That's my fault.
I like to give my young ones

21:08.310 --> 21:09.616
a little something extra.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.661
- Their parents cash
their checks.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.315
It's just my way of making sure

21:13.359 --> 21:15.012
that the girls have
nice things.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.492
- He can gift up to 15K a year.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.320
You want to charge him
with generosity?

21:18.364 --> 21:19.843
Why is my client even here?

21:19.887 --> 21:21.758
- Because we've been talking
to several girls

21:21.802 --> 21:25.675
who "work" for Mr. Getz,
and one of whom was asked

21:25.719 --> 21:28.809
to bring her 12-year-old sister
to the party.

21:28.852 --> 21:31.638
- Yes, they all told me.
They're very loyal.

21:31.681 --> 21:35.642
What I tell them:
Jealousy is the thief of joy.

21:35.685 --> 21:39.210
Whoever's complaining
just wishes they were me.

21:39.254 --> 21:41.561
Even for just a day.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.737
- Thanks for confirming
what we suspected.

21:43.780 --> 21:44.825
You have nothing.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.435
You can stop hanging around
urinals.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.524
My client won't be speaking
to you again.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.528
- And by the way...

21:52.572 --> 21:53.877
Ivy's a great kid.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.357
I'm not gonna hold this
against her.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.663
But you might want
to think twice

21:56.706 --> 21:58.578
about using her
as a battering ram.

21:58.621 --> 22:01.537
Her father's a drunk ex-cop
who shoots from the hip flask.

22:01.581 --> 22:02.712
He's in such a deep hole,

22:02.756 --> 22:05.280
he sent his sister
to shake us down.

22:08.762 --> 22:11.330
[door slams]
- So much for his Boyd Cycle.

22:11.373 --> 22:14.376
- The good news?
They're not onto Kat.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.378
[knocks on door]
- Hey.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.728
I just got a call
from the 116 in Forest Hills.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.774
Frank Bucci had
some kind of accident.

22:20.817 --> 22:21.949
He's in bad shape.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.777
EMTs are taking him
to Queens General.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.569
- Detective Bucci,
how are you?

22:33.613 --> 22:35.310
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, you look it.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.747
- Yeah, busted shoulder,
bum knee.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.575
They want to rule out
internal bleeding.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.882
- Okay, how did this happen?
- Two goons rear-end me.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.927
I get out of the car,
one blindsides me

22:43.971 --> 22:45.320
with a metal pipe.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.409
They took my wallet,
but that was just for show.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.238
- Are you sure?
- They didn't take my gun.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.283
What do you think?
It was a hit.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.589
The thug with the metal pipe
says,

22:53.633 --> 22:55.765
"Tell your little sister
to back off."

22:55.809 --> 22:57.767
I don't even got
a little sister.

22:57.811 --> 23:00.857
So was it that rookie UC?
- We'll look into it.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.816
- Okay, where are
your daughters now?

23:02.859 --> 23:05.949
- Now you worry about them?
Milly was in the back seat.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.691
They could have killed her.
- Okay.

23:08.735 --> 23:11.302
- What are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do?

23:11.346 --> 23:14.088
[phone rings]

23:14.131 --> 23:15.437
Donna.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.831
That idiot EMT called my wife
in rehab.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.746
Give me a sec.
- Okay, sure.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.792
- How's he doing?

23:22.836 --> 23:24.446
- Well, he's hurt,
and he's angry.

23:24.490 --> 23:25.926
- And he wants to know why
the guys who beat him up

23:25.969 --> 23:28.015
told him he'd better have
his sister back off.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.320
- Any leads?

23:29.364 --> 23:30.452
- EMTs found him unconscious

23:30.496 --> 23:31.801
two blocks from his apartment.

23:31.845 --> 23:33.499
We're pulling security cams.
- Good luck.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.630
Two guys in hoodies,
they rear-end him,

23:34.674 --> 23:36.240
attack him, steal his wallet.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.547
- Getz is trying to make this
look like a bump-and-rob.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.027
- After we just brought him in?

23:40.070 --> 23:41.811
- I don't think this has
anything to do with us.

23:41.855 --> 23:44.684
He's trying to send Frank
a message about Aunt Kitty.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.816
- Yeah, you mentioned that
twice already.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.296
The Captain already talked
to me about it.

23:48.339 --> 23:49.515
- You.

23:49.558 --> 23:51.038
This is all
your frickin' fault.

23:51.081 --> 23:53.170
- Ivy, let me explain--
- You got my dad beat up.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.738
If anything happens to him,
it's on you.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.000
- That's--that's enough.
Fin, Fin.

23:57.044 --> 23:59.525
Ivy, I'm Captain Benson,
all right?

23:59.568 --> 24:02.484
And I'm her boss.
Ivy, why don't we take a walk?

24:02.528 --> 24:04.355
Okay?
- Milly, you okay?

24:04.399 --> 24:07.010
I'll hang here
with your sister, okay?

24:08.229 --> 24:10.318
- My dad could've died
because you sent in

24:10.361 --> 24:11.493
that lame-ass UC rookie.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.321
- Ivy, it's not on her.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.410
It's on Getz.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.544
He's not
who you think he is.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.547
- Granya said you'd try
to get me to turn on him.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.811
What? Here comes
the "He's a bad man

24:24.854 --> 24:26.029
who took advantage of you"
speech?

24:26.073 --> 24:27.378
- Not just you.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.946
What about your 12-year-old
sister?

24:29.990 --> 24:32.340
- Nothing happened to her.
- Nope.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.037
Not yet.
- She's fine.

24:34.081 --> 24:37.171
And if you'd kept out of this,
my father would be too.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.651
- [sighs]

24:38.694 --> 24:41.523
- I was so scared.
My dad was just lying there.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.178
I thought he was going to die,
so I called 911.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.833
- You know, you did good
telling them that he was a cop.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.748
It got everybody there
real quick.

24:50.097 --> 24:52.186
- Ivy and my mom say
this is all my fault.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.493
My dad would be fine
if I hadn't said anything.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.017
- Your mom?

24:57.060 --> 24:59.889
- I'm not supposed to say,
but...

24:59.933 --> 25:02.022
Ivy's been telling her
everything.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.458
They're not officially
divorced,

25:03.502 --> 25:04.894
so even though Mom's the one
in rehab,

25:04.938 --> 25:06.505
she keeps pumping us
for information

25:06.548 --> 25:07.723
that makes Dad look bad.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.420
- And you're stuck
in the middle.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.727
- Back off!
Get your hands off me!

25:11.771 --> 25:13.990
- Sir, stop, please--
- Get out of my way!

25:14.034 --> 25:15.470
- Wait here.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.994
- Get out!
- Please take a seat.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.953
- The doctor says you need
a CAT scan.

25:19.996 --> 25:20.997
- I'm fine!

25:21.041 --> 25:22.564
- Mr. Bucci,
you need to calm down.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.392
- Don't tell me to calm down.
- Hey!

25:24.435 --> 25:25.567
- You calm down.
- I got this.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.003
I got it.
Just give us a minute.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.831
Take it easy, they're just
trying to help.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.616
- Oh, yeah, are they trying to
help like SVU's trying to help?

25:30.659 --> 25:32.748
You should've told me
about your UC screwing up.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.924
My ex told me everything!

25:34.968 --> 25:37.448
- She might've overstepped,
but we've got to work this case

25:37.492 --> 25:40.451
from the inside out, all right?
You know how that is.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.670
- Where's my gun?
- Frank...

25:41.714 --> 25:42.932
- Where's my gun?
- Hey, hey, hey.

25:42.976 --> 25:44.630
Shh, you don't need that
right now.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.370
- Listen,
Getz assaulted my daughter.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.937
He tried to kill me!
- All right.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.678
- I should've handled this
myself in the first place!

25:49.722 --> 25:51.288
- Okay, Frank.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.463
It's all right.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.988
- Ivy,
Getz went after your father.

25:55.031 --> 25:58.121
He has his sights set
on your sister,

25:58.165 --> 26:00.602
who is a child.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.604
He's not gonna stop.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.693
- That's why you should just
leave him alone.

26:04.737 --> 26:08.175
- We can't.
Ivy, what he did to you...

26:10.177 --> 26:12.440
That's against the law.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.660
And we need you to testify,

26:14.703 --> 26:18.402
so we can put him
in prison where he belongs.

26:18.446 --> 26:21.275
- Ivy!
Hurry, Daddy's in trouble!

26:21.318 --> 26:23.146
- What?
- Come on.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.628
- I want my gun back.
You guys took it!

26:26.672 --> 26:28.325
You took my gun, you guys
have it, I want it back.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.806
- Okay, Frank, stay over here.
- Where is it?

26:30.850 --> 26:32.765
- NYPD, it's all right.
- No, it's not.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.331
I want my gun now.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.160
- Hey, Detective Bucci, I need
you--I need you to stop.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.988
- I just want my gun back.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.381
- Daddy, please,
you should be resting.

26:40.424 --> 26:41.817
- Ivy, take your sister home.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.645
- What are you doing?
- Taking care of you.

26:43.689 --> 26:44.864
I just want to talk
to that scumbag.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.169
- That's not a good idea,
Frank.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.954
- Dad, please,
you'll go to jail.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.869
- Detective Bucci, you know
that this is not the way.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.522
- Ivy, I said
take your sister home.

26:51.566 --> 26:53.002
Nobody listens to me.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.744
- Detective, I'm gonna have to
ask you to calm down.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.267
- Don't tell me to calm down!

26:57.311 --> 26:59.008
Nobody listens to a damn word
I say!

26:59.052 --> 27:01.271
- I'm listening.
We're all listening to you.

27:01.315 --> 27:04.666
- Good, 'cause
he's not getting away with it.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.364
You hear me?
All right, let's go, girls.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.279
- I don't know what that means,
Frank, but I can't let you walk

27:09.323 --> 27:11.020
out of here with those words.
Frank--

27:11.064 --> 27:12.500
- Now!
- Dad, wait, stop.

27:12.543 --> 27:15.677
- I said let's go now!
- Stop!

27:15.721 --> 27:18.071
I'll testify.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.858
I'll tell them everything.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.904
Please...

27:35.523 --> 27:37.699

27:37.743 --> 27:39.396
There is a steady stream
of girls coming--

27:39.440 --> 27:41.703
- I heard you, Detective,
but all you really have

27:41.747 --> 27:43.096
is one 15-year-old girl

27:43.139 --> 27:44.488
who's been on Getz's payroll
as a model.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.708

as Ivy's aunt.

27:55.543 --> 27:58.372
- A UC Getz is onto?
- Not yet.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.722
- But he does know
that he is the target.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.332
- How?

28:02.376 --> 28:05.553
You didn't bring him in,
did you?

28:05.596 --> 28:07.337
You should've come
to me earlier.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.035
Getz could've cleared
his hard drives.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.167
He could be on a private jet
as we speak.

28:11.211 --> 28:13.213

we need to move now.
