00:04.250 --> 00:05.660
Previously on Siren...

00:05.670 --> 00:07.206
[Ryn]
This death my fault.

00:07.210 --> 00:10.111
I put the North Star
in danger, Ryn. Me.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.371
They attacked us.

00:13.670 --> 00:15.535
They tried to kill
every one of us of that ship.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.746
Aah!

00:16.750 --> 00:18.456
You need to keep
an eye on Xander.

00:18.460 --> 00:20.109
He doesn't look well.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.702
If he were to find out
that Ryn is one of them...

00:22.710 --> 00:25.281
Hello. I am sorry.

00:25.290 --> 00:28.919
-What?
-They kill your father.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.956
All this time,
you've been lying to me?

00:30.960 --> 00:32.416
Haida myths, remember?

00:32.420 --> 00:34.706
About the shape-shifters
who could transform

00:34.710 --> 00:36.450
into spirit animals.

00:36.460 --> 00:39.532
You know the myths
about a Siren song, right?

00:39.540 --> 00:41.110
It gets inside your head.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.031
Will you sing to me again?

00:43.040 --> 00:45.611
-What are you barking at?
-[dog barking]

00:47.040 --> 00:48.280
[groaning]

00:50.080 --> 00:51.286

00:52.330 --> 00:54.958
[Ben panting]

01:15.500 --> 01:18.287
[hissing and growling]

01:26.040 --> 01:28.281
[screaming]

01:41.080 --> 01:43.537
[seagulls calling]

01:54.420 --> 01:57.492
[metal detector beeping]

02:03.290 --> 02:05.952
I didn't know
this was a nude beach.

02:15.830 --> 02:19.072
[rock music playing]

02:22.830 --> 02:23.956
Take 'em down

02:23.960 --> 02:25.530
Take 'em down

02:25.540 --> 02:28.418
Push their face
right to the ground

02:28.420 --> 02:31.071
Bring the dirt,
make 'em hurt

02:31.080 --> 02:34.288
Lightnin' fast,
oh, don't look now

02:34.290 --> 02:37.202
Gonna take 'em down, yeah

02:37.210 --> 02:39.610
Gonna take 'em down

02:39.620 --> 02:42.248
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

02:55.460 --> 02:58.031
Breakfast?

02:58.040 --> 03:01.077
Ryn. That's
her name, right?

03:01.080 --> 03:03.378
Yeah. What about her?

03:03.380 --> 03:04.529
You think she knows
where he is?

03:06.080 --> 03:07.069
The one who killed my dad?

03:07.080 --> 03:08.661
No, I don't think she does.

03:08.670 --> 03:09.876
But she knows
where we can find him.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.166
Like, out there,
wherever he is.

03:12.170 --> 03:15.162
Xander, I know
how you must feel,

03:15.170 --> 03:18.378
but going after him,
it's not gonna be good.

03:18.380 --> 03:21.167
You saw
what they're capable of.

03:21.170 --> 03:22.956
You'll find a way
through this.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.168
A shark.

03:27.170 --> 03:29.491
Shark hunts to eat,
right?

03:29.500 --> 03:32.321
I mean, these things,
they attacked us.

03:32.330 --> 03:35.117
They came after us
with some kind
of Sle-aSS vengeance.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.111
Ryn isn't like that.
She changed.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.872
If she can,
so can the others.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.700
Well, if she's so good, then
how come she can't help us?

03:40.710 --> 03:43.110
Help you do what?
Kill him?

03:46.420 --> 03:48.115
Where are you going?

03:48.120 --> 03:50.247
I gotta get something
from my mom's, okay?

03:51.380 --> 03:52.665
Don't worry, Maddie.

03:52.670 --> 03:54.285
Seriously, I got this.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.450
[Ryn] Hello, Ben.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.371
Hey.

04:04.500 --> 04:08.573
[Siren song echoing]

04:27.380 --> 04:28.995
Where's Maddie?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.821
Uh, she...

04:31.830 --> 04:34.572
stayed with Xander
last night.

04:34.580 --> 04:37.458
She's trying to make sure
that he's okay.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.576
Is he okay?

04:39.580 --> 04:42.037
I don't know.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.416
He's been through a lot.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.160
I am sad for him.

04:45.170 --> 04:48.162
Yeah. Me, too.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.661
Is Ben okay?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.069
Yeah.

04:56.540 --> 04:57.700
Ben is good.

05:00.710 --> 05:02.951
How was Sean's memorial?

05:02.960 --> 05:05.201
Tough, but good.

05:05.210 --> 05:07.371
I think everyone's
still in shock.

05:07.380 --> 05:08.495
Xander?

05:08.500 --> 05:12.038
That's part
of why I came.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.452
I'm worried about him.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.786
[Patti] Xander?

05:24.250 --> 05:25.239
Xander?

05:27.580 --> 05:28.877
Hey.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.529
What are you doing here?

05:30.540 --> 05:32.747
I was-- Nothin'.
I was just, uh...

05:32.750 --> 05:35.162
lookin' for a jacket
that Dad had, but...

05:35.170 --> 05:38.458
Um, can you do me
a favor and return this
to Helen, please?

05:40.830 --> 05:42.377
Ma, it's really
not a great time.

05:42.380 --> 05:44.666
[sighs]

05:44.670 --> 05:47.241
Not really a great time
for me, either, Xander.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.498
All right, all right.
I'll take it.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.489
I'm sorry.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.990
I'm sorry.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.030
[door opens, bell jingles]

06:15.670 --> 06:17.456
[Helen]
Why did you come back?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.416
-Ryn.
-Who are they?

06:27.080 --> 06:28.786
I know what happened
on the boat.

06:28.790 --> 06:31.111
Were you there?

06:31.120 --> 06:32.781
Did you kill him?

06:32.790 --> 06:35.327
Sean, he was my friend.

06:35.330 --> 06:38.538
We take Ryn
back to her home.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.242
[Helen] I thought you
only kill for survival,

06:43.250 --> 06:47.493
but now-- aggression,
plotting, revenge.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.287
You're more _human
than I realized.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.576
We are her family.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.956
She must come back.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.451
What if she doesn't
want to go with you?

06:56.460 --> 07:00.578
She seems very attached
to her human friends.

07:04.210 --> 07:06.451
Where is Ryn?

07:09.670 --> 07:11.114
[hisses]

07:11.120 --> 07:12.530
[gasping]

07:15.290 --> 07:17.781
[strained]
I don't know where she is.

07:24.540 --> 07:27.327
Helen should help me.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.530
[sniffling]

07:34.670 --> 07:35.955
[dialing]

07:40.670 --> 07:42.069
Ben.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.664
My sister is back?

07:45.670 --> 07:48.992
Yeah.
She's with two others.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.322
They want me back
in the water.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.165
What do you want?

07:57.620 --> 08:00.578
I want to choose

08:00.580 --> 08:02.207
when I go on land,

08:02.210 --> 08:04.030
when I go in the water.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.611
Okay. So that's
what we'll tell them.

08:06.620 --> 08:10.374
Maybe what I want
is not important.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.745
Of course it is.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.991
It will be bad.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.456
They will not listen.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.820
They will hurt people

08:19.830 --> 08:21.570
unless I go back with them.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.161
We can talk to them.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.821
If you want to stay, Ryn,
that's your choice.

08:25.830 --> 08:26.990
It's not theirs.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.661
It is better ifI go.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.991
These two with my sister,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.207
I know them.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.576
They are strong.

08:35.580 --> 08:36.820
Hunters.

08:36.830 --> 08:38.377
They will keep coming,

08:38.380 --> 08:39.779
only more danger.

08:39.790 --> 08:41.417
It doesn't have to be
like this.

08:41.420 --> 08:42.660
We can change it.

08:44.670 --> 08:47.207
You can't just go back.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.666
I need you here.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.997
I know where
my srster wrll go

08:58.000 --> 08:59.991
to look for me.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.707
We will go there

09:02.710 --> 09:04.951
before they hurt
anymore people.

09:09.290 --> 09:11.030
I'll see you
at the house then.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.701
Yeah, sounds good.

09:12.710 --> 09:13.870
Have you folks
been helped?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.609
We were out on the beach,

09:15.620 --> 09:17.781
when these three nudists
assaulted us and
stole our clothes.

09:17.790 --> 09:18.779
Nudists?

09:18.790 --> 09:20.326
They were aggressive as hell.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.070
One of them shoved
my wife on the ground.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.820
-You said there were
three of them?
-Mm-hmm.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.377
They seemed like foreigners.

09:25.380 --> 09:26.745
They didn't speak
much English.

09:26.750 --> 09:31.073
Maybe Europeans.
It's popular there-- nudity.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.490
[hissing]

09:50.670 --> 09:51.819
[soft hiss]

09:57.420 --> 09:59.240
I go with you.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.319
I come.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.490
Yes.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.070
[exhales]

10:13.960 --> 10:15.450
[Ben] Wait. She said
she's gonna go back.

10:15.460 --> 10:19.032
That means
you all go back, right?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.029
[hissing]

10:21.210 --> 10:23.872
[Ryn] Please, no.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.529
Ryn, tell me
what's goin' on.

10:25.540 --> 10:26.666
[soft hiss]

10:26.670 --> 10:29.537
Not here to take me back.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.917
Here to kill.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.668
-[hissin
-No! 9]

10:42.830 --> 10:44.661
We are family.

10:44.670 --> 10:45.819
I am you.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.741
Family.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.876
[Ryn] Yes.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.108
We are the same.

10:59.710 --> 11:01.780
[both hissing]

11:01.790 --> 11:03.451
[Donna] You kill her,

11:03.460 --> 11:04.870
you kill me, too.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.279
Ryn, down!

11:08.120 --> 11:10.532
[screaming]

11:12.210 --> 11:13.529
Go, go, go! Let's go!

11:13.540 --> 11:16.532
[screaming]

11:16.540 --> 11:18.997
[groaning]

11:19.000 --> 11:20.911
-You okay?
-Yes.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.740
-Sister okay?
-[engine starts]

11:30.960 --> 11:33.167
Helen teach me.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.169
They tell me

11:38.170 --> 11:41.412
they want you to come
back to water.

11:41.420 --> 11:42.956
That is all.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.781
Not kill.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.496
Yes.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.070
I know.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.822
Why can't they
just let you go back?

11:51.830 --> 11:53.912
Why do they need
to kill you?

11:53.920 --> 11:56.070
I spend too much time
with humans.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.536
Why does that matter?

11:59.580 --> 12:01.241
There was one of us

12:01.250 --> 12:02.786
who spent time
with a human

12:02.790 --> 12:05.167
long time ago.

12:05.170 --> 12:07.661
She lived with him
onland.

12:07.670 --> 12:10.912
Together,
they had little one.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.615
-A child?
-Yes.

12:12.620 --> 12:15.248
But the child
was not normal,

12:15.250 --> 12:18.287
not look normal.

12:18.290 --> 12:21.919
He took it away from her
into the woods.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.491
He killed their child.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.207
So she went back home
in the water.

12:27.210 --> 12:30.418
But this made him angry.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.957
His head-- bad.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.996
He brought many men,

12:35.000 --> 12:36.820
and they killed us.

12:36.830 --> 12:38.912
So many of us that...

12:40.790 --> 12:42.417
the water was red

12:42.420 --> 12:44.820
with our blood.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.036
Helen told me that story.

12:47.380 --> 12:49.109
Not about a child, though.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.530
Story?

12:50.540 --> 12:52.997
No, not story.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.035
Real.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.248
You ask me
why they don't want me.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.957
I am too close to humans.
This IS why.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.417
We can teach them
that you being here

13:02.420 --> 13:03.956
can help with the problems
in the ocean.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.201
They don't trust.

13:06.210 --> 13:09.532
They are scared
that what happened

13:09.540 --> 13:11.701
will happen again.

13:11.710 --> 13:13.666
They want me dead
because they believe

13:13.670 --> 13:15.877
it's the only way
they will survive.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.320
This is not how we are.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.537
We take care of each other

13:21.540 --> 13:22.950
in the water.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.531
But now,

13:25.540 --> 13:28.668
they are afraid of me.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.200
It's okay.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.990
[phone ringing]

13:44.330 --> 13:45.877
[beeps]

13:45.880 --> 13:48.030
-[Ben] Maddie?
-More of them are here.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.497
I know. We just
got away from them.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.070
They're after Ryn,
Maddie.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.911
And Donna, too.
They want to kill them.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.615
Maybe you should
take them somewhere.

13:55.620 --> 13:56.917
Where?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.615
I don't know.
Somewhere out of here.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.872
And if we get them away,
what then?

14:00.880 --> 14:02.450
Those two are still here.

14:02.460 --> 14:06.112
We let them murder people,
destroy the town?

14:06.120 --> 14:07.701
These two are dangerous.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.917
They're the ones
who killed Sean.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.160
We need to keep Ryn safe.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.161
Whatever it takes.

14:14.170 --> 14:16.206
I'm here with my dad.
I'm gonna talk to him,

14:16.210 --> 14:17.609
get the police involved.

14:17.620 --> 14:18.951
That's what makes sense here.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.201
You guys just wait.

14:21.210 --> 14:23.747
Nobody's hurting anyone.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.786
[doorknob rattles]

14:32.920 --> 14:34.035
Come in.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.371
Hey, Helen.

14:35.380 --> 14:37.109
[bell jingles]

14:37.120 --> 14:40.169
Um, Mom, she wanted
to get this back to you.

14:42.120 --> 14:46.329
Uh, you know,
I wanted to thank you

14:46.330 --> 14:48.161
for everything you've been
doing for her, you know?

14:48.170 --> 14:49.876
It means a lot.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.701
What happened to your father
was truly awful.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.075
Yeah.

14:57.170 --> 14:58.785
Yeah, that's
a good word for it.

14:58.790 --> 15:01.031
To witness that, I can--

15:01.040 --> 15:03.201
I can only imagine.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.871
You know what happened.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.246
Yes.

15:20.330 --> 15:22.878
Is there something
you should be telling me?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.245
They said they, uh,

15:24.250 --> 15:29.529
came here to, uh,
take Ryn back.

15:29.540 --> 15:32.031
But I want you
to protect yourself

15:32.040 --> 15:32.950
and keep your mum safe.

15:35.210 --> 15:36.780
They're here?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.369
Hello.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.246
Can I please
have my ball back?

16:01.380 --> 16:02.369
Thank you.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.286
Where are you going?

16:19.290 --> 16:21.281
I'm gonna round
those things up.

16:21.290 --> 16:22.496
I can't have them
roamIn' around town.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.286
Dad, you remember
what it was like

16:24.290 --> 16:26.167
tryin' to get Ryn in here.
They're very strong.

16:26.170 --> 16:27.956
Well, I'll have
multiple units out there.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.030
But what are you
gonna do with them
once you've got them?

16:30.040 --> 16:31.951
I'll figure that out
when the time comes.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.667
Dad, these other deputies,
they can't know
what they really are.

16:34.670 --> 16:36.285
They don't have to.

16:36.290 --> 16:38.281
We have a drug epidemic
on our hands.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.110
They'll just think
they're tweakers.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.496
They're gonna have
questions, Dad.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.956
You can't keep them here.

16:44.290 --> 16:45.871
I'll think of something.

16:47.330 --> 16:49.491

It's Elaine Pownall.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.824
Mrs. Pownall.

16:59.830 --> 17:01.491
You were so kind
to recommend me

17:01.500 --> 17:03.320
for the clinical trial,

17:03.330 --> 17:05.036
and I haven't had a chance
to say thank you.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.610
[Decker]
It's no problem at all.

17:06.620 --> 17:08.417
Look, if you could
give me your address,

17:08.420 --> 17:10.285
I would love _
to send you something.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.372
It's really
not necessary.

17:12.380 --> 17:13.916
Please, I should have
done it days ago.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.239
Just with the funeral
and everything,

17:15.250 --> 17:16.569
we've been out of sorts.

17:16.580 --> 17:17.956
Funeral?

17:17.960 --> 17:20.246
A local fisherman--
Sean McClure?

17:20.250 --> 17:22.707
There was a horrible accident.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.610
Dr. Decker?

17:24.620 --> 17:26.201
When did it happen?

17:26.210 --> 17:28.201
About a week ago.

17:28.210 --> 17:31.031
It was actually the night
of our fundraising gala.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.871

Hello?

17:41.330 --> 17:43.036
Too much waiting.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.992
We're gonna figure out
how to stop them.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.206
It's okay.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.281
It's okay.

Hello.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.371

This is Ryn's sister.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.786
Yeah? No shit.

18:56.790 --> 18:57.825
You were there,

18:59.670 --> 19:00.989
on the boat?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.787
Do you know where he is?

19:03.790 --> 19:05.917
The one who killed my dad!
Do you know?!

19:05.920 --> 19:07.785
Xander, stop.

19:07.790 --> 19:09.326
He's here

19:09.330 --> 19:10.570
to kill us now.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.321
-Xander.
-I'm goin' after him.

19:14.330 --> 19:16.912
I'm gonna take him down.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.456
Xander, put the gun down.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.701
Aw, come on, man.

19:20.710 --> 19:22.496
All I'm askin' is
to go after the thing
that killed my dad!

19:22.500 --> 19:24.320
You could at least pretend
like you give a damn!

19:24.330 --> 19:27.288
-Of course I give--
-Maybe this is what
we need to do.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.279
What Xander says.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.321
Maybe
this is the only way.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.491
Yes.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.663
Ryn, are you sure
about this?

19:45.290 --> 19:47.326
We will help you
find him.

You down with this?

In the alley by the boatyard
on Spring Street.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.240
He's bringing him
into the station.

find the other one.

No, what you need to do
is get back home.

28:39.670 --> 28:41.956
You're both messed up
in the head

28:41.960 --> 28:42.824
over those things, huh?

28:44.830 --> 28:46.411
_ I'm not the one
walkIn' through my hometown

Well, um...

28:52.040 --> 28:55.032
you help me
take him down,

28:55.040 --> 28:57.873
you can do whatever
the hell you want
with Ryn's sister.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.450
What are you plannin'
to do with her?

29:23.920 --> 29:25.911
[laughing]

29:25.920 --> 29:27.535
Sheriff,
what in God's name?

29:27.540 --> 29:29.667
Get inside, Sylvia,
now!

29:37.330 --> 29:38.536
[Ben] Hey.

29:38.540 --> 29:41.748
Look, I know
it must be hard,

29:41.750 --> 29:43.661
lettin' your sister stay.

29:43.670 --> 29:46.878
I mean, that'd be a big deal
for a human, too.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.245
VVhoa!

29:54.460 --> 29:55.495
I see her.

30:00.830 --> 30:01.910
[Maddie] Dad!

30:06.210 --> 30:07.871
What happened
to your head?

30:07.880 --> 30:10.826
I'm fine. Come on,
you're goin' back home.

30:10.830 --> 30:11.819
-Have you seen Ben?
-[gate clinks]

30:13.880 --> 30:14.995

30:42.250 --> 30:43.877
-Is everything okay?
-My dad's been hit!

30:43.880 --> 30:45.029
My dad's been hit!

30:45.040 --> 30:46.109
I'm okay!

30:46.120 --> 30:47.951
All right, we gotta
get you out of here.

30:47.960 --> 30:49.166
We can take him
to Helen's.

30:49.170 --> 30:50.876
[groaning]

30:50.880 --> 30:53.030
Okay. Go! Go, go!

31:08.830 --> 31:10.707

31:10.710 --> 31:12.280
All right.
On your good leg?

31:12.290 --> 31:13.746
Yeah, that's good.

31:13.750 --> 31:14.990
[groaning]

31:15.000 --> 31:17.116
Ohh!

31:17.120 --> 31:18.576
-I'm fine, I'm fine!
Stop fussing!
-Shush!

31:18.580 --> 31:21.492
I'll get some bandages
and antiseptic.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.240
Listen,
we have to stop them

31:23.250 --> 31:25.286
before they hurt
anyone else.

31:25.290 --> 31:27.781
Call Marissa, get
all available units
on the street.

31:27.790 --> 31:28.916
Okay.

31:32.540 --> 31:35.031
-Maddie, wait. Wait.
-What?

31:35.040 --> 31:37.247
I don't think
that's a good idea.

31:37.250 --> 31:39.115
If we call the cops now,

31:39.120 --> 31:41.372
there's no way we'll
ever contain this thing.

31:42.710 --> 31:44.166
It's already out of control.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.785
We have no choice.

31:45.790 --> 31:48.202
Okay, and what happens
if the cops find Ryn?

31:48.210 --> 31:50.166
What happens then?

31:50.170 --> 31:53.162
Look, we can
solve this on our own.

31:53.170 --> 31:54.205
We can protect her.

31:54.210 --> 31:55.700
No, we can't.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.325
It's too late.

31:57.330 --> 31:59.378
What is going on with you?

31:59.380 --> 32:00.779
Your judgment
is totally screwed up.

32:00.790 --> 32:02.109
Don't you care about her?

32:02.120 --> 32:03.667
Of course I do.

32:03.670 --> 32:05.319
Of course I do.

32:05.330 --> 32:07.036
You're the one
putting her in danger,

32:07.040 --> 32:09.326
going out with Xander
like some crazed vigilante.

32:09.330 --> 32:10.820
You're acting insane.

32:10.830 --> 32:12.320
Yeah.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.742
Hey. Where the hell
are you going?

32:14.750 --> 32:15.956
To help Ryn.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.247
I just-- I just
want to help, okay?

33:12.250 --> 33:14.411
Just, please,
give me another chance.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.615
Tell me what you want,
please.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.700
Move.

[groaning]

34:59.790 --> 35:01.075
[Ryn] No!

35:08.000 --> 35:09.160
You listen to me now.

35:36.790 --> 35:37.779
[Maddie]
What's going on?

35:37.790 --> 35:40.372
It's a matriarchy.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.826
It seems Ryn's now
the dominant female.

35:42.830 --> 35:44.161
[hisses]

35:45.380 --> 35:47.325
[Ben] It's over?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.029
[Ryn] Yes.

35:51.790 --> 35:53.451
Xander, wait!

35:53.460 --> 35:55.826
Stay where you are, Ben!

35:55.830 --> 35:57.320
Man, you
don't want to do this!

35:57.330 --> 35:58.786
It's settled!

35:58.790 --> 35:59.825
It's done!

35:59.830 --> 36:00.819
Not for me.

36:00.830 --> 36:02.661
Drop it, Xander!

36:02.670 --> 36:04.319
They're animals, Sheriff!

36:04.330 --> 36:06.241
They're animals
who kill humans.

36:06.250 --> 36:09.959
Doing this is not gonna
bring your dad back.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.531
It's only gonna cause
more trouble, man.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.280
Xander, please.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.286
Stop!

36:24.920 --> 36:26.035

36:50.330 --> 36:52.958
My place. Go!

Quick, quick.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.322
[sirens approaching]

37:13.710 --> 37:15.371
You go back.

37:15.380 --> 37:17.371
Never come again.

37:27.420 --> 37:29.320
[siren]

37:38.330 --> 37:43.165
They're taking Donna
back to Helen's.

37:43.170 --> 37:44.785
Are you coming?

37:44.790 --> 37:47.782
I'm gonna stay
with my dad right now.

37:47.790 --> 37:48.870
I'll, uh...

37:48.880 --> 37:50.495
I'll be by later.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.161
-Maddie.
-For Ryn.

37:53.210 --> 37:54.199
Go.

37:54.210 --> 37:55.370
They need you.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.576
Ben, I can help.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.116
Not now.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.326
She doesn't want you.

38:10.580 --> 38:11.956
[Marissa]
Your leg, Sheriff.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.416
I'll be fine.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.570
-Happened in the crash?
-Yeah.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.536
Deer jumped
right out in front
of my vehicle.

38:19.580 --> 38:21.411
The deer is fine.

38:21.420 --> 38:22.535
Not a scratch.

38:24.380 --> 38:26.280
We'll keep Xander
in the drunk tank.

38:26.290 --> 38:27.996
Give him a day
to cool off.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.570
Wait, you're
not gonna charge him?

38:29.580 --> 38:31.377
For bein'
a grief-stricken jackass?

38:31.380 --> 38:32.369
No, I'm not.

38:32.380 --> 38:36.578
When the lion's den

38:36.580 --> 38:41.745
Will finally sleep

38:41.750 --> 38:44.378
Oh, gosh.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.240
How is she?

38:52.500 --> 38:54.377
[whispering]
Notgood.

38:54.380 --> 38:55.415
[sighs]

38:56.460 --> 38:58.075
The others?

38:58.080 --> 38:59.661
I send them back

38:59.670 --> 39:00.876
to the water.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.450
They will say I'm dead.

39:04.380 --> 39:05.950
When she's better,

39:05.960 --> 39:07.666
she will go home.

39:12.210 --> 39:14.030
We can't take her
to a hospital.

39:14.040 --> 39:17.453
They wouldn't
know how to treat
one of her kind anyway.

39:21.330 --> 39:25.323
Oh, beware the demons

39:25.330 --> 39:30.324
Who fill your soul

39:30.330 --> 39:35.324
They will fill your soul

39:50.420 --> 39:52.490
Between you and me

39:52.500 --> 39:53.876
How are you feeling?

39:53.880 --> 39:55.245
Oh!

39:55.250 --> 39:56.569
You keep treating me
this well,

39:56.580 --> 39:58.912
I'll never go
back to work.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.956
Yeah, that'll happen.

40:05.750 --> 40:08.378
Those creatures, Maddie,

40:08.380 --> 40:11.110
they can't be here.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.872
I know.

40:15.790 --> 40:17.496
But they can learn.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.070
Evolve just like Ryn did.

40:20.880 --> 40:24.247
I don't want to have
to choose a side,

40:24.250 --> 40:26.662
but if I do,

40:26.670 --> 40:28.456
this town comes first.

[Donna wheezing]

40:35.670 --> 40:37.911
She's getting worse.

40:37.920 --> 40:40.286
We need to do something.

40:40.290 --> 40:42.702
[Ben] Ryn?

40:42.710 --> 40:45.747
Now, it's a long shot,

40:45.750 --> 40:47.490
but there is someone
who might be able to help.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.327
Someone who has
your Sister's blood.

40:52.330 --> 40:54.116
Stem cells.

40:56.710 --> 40:57.699
I can make the call.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.783
Okay. Yes.

41:05.790 --> 41:09.578
- Don't waste your time

Dr. Decker, it's Ben.

41:21.790 --> 41:23.371
We need you.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.996
Back around

Back around
