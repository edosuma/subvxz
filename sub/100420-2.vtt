[Mr. Peanutbutter]
If there's one thing I've learned

00:14.973 --> 00:17.183
from this crazy mambo called life,

00:17.350 --> 00:22.230
it's that anyone can be a birthday father,
but it takes a heart full of birthdays

00:22.313 --> 00:24.232
to be a true Birthday Dad.

00:24.315 --> 00:29.738
-♪ Got a heart full of birthday-- ♪
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Stop! Go back!

00:31.031 --> 00:31.865

-[snoring]
-Please tell me you guys see that.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.994
[stammers] Oh! Looks great! Uh, love it!

00:36.161 --> 00:37.495
What's wrong with your face?

00:37.579 --> 00:39.748
I just don't buy it,
Director Flea Daniels.

00:39.831 --> 00:43.668
That just doesn't look like the honest,
trustworthy face of a Birthday Dad.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.586
What?

00:44.669 --> 00:47.130
This is clearly the face
of a guy who did something terrible,

00:47.213 --> 00:48.923
like, I don't know,
cheat on his girlfriend

00:49.007 --> 00:50.633
with his ex-wife a couple of times

00:50.717 --> 00:53.053
and instead of confessing
to his girlfriend, asked her to marry him,

00:53.136 --> 00:55.430
so now they're engaged,
and she still has no idea.

00:55.513 --> 00:58.558
Can't you see he's racked with guilt?
It's all over his very handsome face!

00:58.725 --> 01:00.810
Did Birthday Dad cheat on his girlfriend?

01:00.894 --> 01:04.481
No, I'm just saying he looks like he did.
We have to re-edit the scene.

01:04.564 --> 01:08.568
No. You've been dragging this out
with your ridiculous tweaks and demands

01:08.651 --> 01:11.154
for what is the stupidest premise
I've ever seen.

01:11.237 --> 01:14.032
I gotta go prep my next film,
"The Diary of Anne Frankenstein."

01:14.115 --> 01:17.160

-Huh? No, I'm over!

01:17.243 --> 01:20.038

on this project!

Hey, do you wanna keep hanging out?

01:25.293 --> 01:28.004

"Officer Mike Condolences,"

Uh, I should probably get home to my baby.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.388
Oh! Congrats on your new baby...

01:37.472 --> 01:39.933

03:08.605 --> 03:10.023
Would you stay if I named her Renata?

03:10.106 --> 03:13.943
I understand you are very respected
in your field, so I ask you this.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.863
Would you work for a client
who has no regard for your time,

03:16.946 --> 03:19.574

and your general well-being?

Yes, that's all my clients.

of that assistant from, like, 20 years ago

who I screamed at for bringing me
a room temp Capri-Sun

05:16.733 --> 05:18.234

is finding a new nanny.

about the "Manatee Fair" photo shoot

Who Do It All" issue.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.931

at your pretty kitty face

05:57.065 --> 05:59.942
at my photo shoot, so I can decide later
which parts to retouch?

-I don't think I can make it, Amanda.
-Too bad. Vanessa Gekko's here.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.075
Gekko? Well, that's fine if Vanessa needs
to get the word out

06:07.158 --> 06:09.660
about her struggling business,
but I'm too busy doing it all

06:09.744 --> 06:12.080
to pose for a photo
of "Women Who Do It All."

06:12.163 --> 06:14.707

and you know that, but does the industry?

[Princess Carolyn]
The creator of "Med School Nights"?

06:20.088 --> 06:23.383
[Amanda] Karen Kitada created
the number-one show on network television,

06:23.466 --> 06:26.761
and its spin-off,
"Med School Nights: The Day Shift."

06:26.844 --> 06:30.014
Everyone wanted to work with her,
everyone!

06:30.098 --> 06:33.518
She had more overall deal offers
than an OshKosh B'gosh outlet.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.229
-Then a baby fell out of her!
-[Princess Carolyn] Well, that's--

06:36.312 --> 06:38.147

Three weeks!

06:38.231 --> 06:40.817
And when she came back,
"Tumbleweeds", "Crickets"...

06:40.900 --> 06:43.611
And those are just two of the projects
she wasn't offered

06:43.694 --> 06:47.115
because the studios were dubious
about her priorities.

06:47.198 --> 06:50.284
-Do you have the right priorities?
-Of course I do!

06:50.368 --> 06:51.369

apps running at the same time.

07:29.198 --> 07:33.494
I have my mom app, and my career app,
and my wife app, and my yoga body app,

07:33.578 --> 07:36.414

all the time.

to bring our kids.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.862
I haven't even had a spare minute
to think of a name.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.030
It's a lot of pressure.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.324
I don't want my daughter to resent me
for the rest of her life

08:11.407 --> 08:13.451
because I named her
something stupid like...

08:13.534 --> 08:15.077

-Aw...
-Don't listen to her, Light Socket.

-She's just jealous.
-Uh-oh. Sorry!

08:19.540 --> 08:22.251
And what have you been working on
that's been keeping you so busy?

08:22.335 --> 08:25.171
We just locked picture on "Birthday Dad"
with Mr. Peanutbutter.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.507
That sounds awfully masculine.

-Dad, mister--
-Nut?

08:29.550 --> 08:32.220
-Pean?
-Right, but I'm producing it, so...

08:34.680 --> 08:36.849
Oh, it sounds like you're doing it all
for yourself,

08:36.933 --> 08:40.436
but the new doing it all
is doing it all for other women.

08:40.603 --> 08:44.524
Oh, yeah, well, the twist
about "Birthday Dad" is the women

08:44.607 --> 08:46.526
have equal screen time to the men
in the movie,

08:46.609 --> 08:48.402
and the same number of birthdays!

08:48.736 --> 08:51.572
-Very subversive.
-Less man. More Leslie Mann.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.866
Cut out what you need to.
If it makes sense, that's a bonus.

Gotta go!

Ladies, we have got to find time
to connect like this more often.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.747
This is so empowering.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.208
We could put together
a kind of low-key salon

09:02.291 --> 09:05.002
where women exchange ideas
and support each other.

09:05.086 --> 09:05.920
With bagels!

09:06.003 --> 09:09.882
I'd be more than happy to host,
and take care of the caterer, and emcee.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.175
You know, it all!

09:11.259 --> 09:13.427
-I'll co-host!
-In that case, why not blow it out?

09:13.511 --> 09:14.887
-Let's make it an event.
-Oh, well--

09:14.971 --> 09:19.308
Princess Carolyn, VIM has that massive
foyer that never has anyone waiting in it.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.144
-[gasps] You could finally put it to use!
-We could.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.563
Move that. That's too close to the wall.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.440
And I happen to know The Fugees
have been looking for the right time

09:26.524 --> 09:28.818
to do a reunion concert.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.945
Should I call Lauryn? Hill?
I call her Lauryn.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.073
A concert? Well, that'll take some time
to put together.

09:34.156 --> 09:37.159
Bring it on a little bit. Move it up
a quarter of an inch. Do you mind?

09:37.493 --> 09:40.162
Since it's on your turf,
I'll focus on the big-picture stuff

09:40.246 --> 09:42.665
and leave all the organization
and planning to you.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.334

-We wouldn't want that.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.645
-[pops]
-"Sure, I'd be happy to."

19:48.729 --> 19:51.190
-Great. I'll see you at VIM in 15 minutes.
-[baby crying]

19:51.273 --> 19:53.442
-Um... okay?
-[phone beeps]

19:53.525 --> 19:56.361
I'll be right back.
[pants] Sorry about that.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.447
[phone rings]

19:58.530 --> 19:59.990
-Hello?
-Todd, change of plans.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.701
Bring the baby over to me
at SmashFox Studios.

20:02.784 --> 20:06.788
Okay, he had to cancel another meeting
but he will see you now.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.790
-I'll be right back.
-[baby cries]

20:08.874 --> 20:10.584
I'm going to level with you, Todd.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.254
You making me wait made me angry,
and that made me respect you.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.257
Sorry, things have just been a little
hectic since I've been helping out

20:17.341 --> 20:19.384
with Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.638
"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"?
I'm intrigued.

20:22.721 --> 20:26.558
-You think the project has legs?
-Yeah, she has legs.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.477
I'm thrilled to meet you.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.980
The whole town is buzzing
about "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project."

20:32.064 --> 20:33.857
Weird, but okay.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.234
We need something big.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.777
Is "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"

20:36.860 --> 20:38.528
the kind of thing
that makes a lot of noise?

20:38.612 --> 20:39.696
She sure does!

20:39.780 --> 20:41.198
I'm in. Name your price.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.574
Um...

20:42.991 --> 20:44.076
Jonathan?

20:44.159 --> 20:46.995
We took a big swing
with Dick Wolf's Milwaukee shows.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.873
Turns out audiences are not interested
in a whole night of Milwaukee,

20:49.957 --> 20:51.625
so now we've got some slots to fill.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.419
Do you think
"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"

20:54.503 --> 20:56.088
could live for several seasons?

20:56.171 --> 21:00.217
I don't see how those things are related,
but I certainly hope so!

21:00.300 --> 21:02.427
-Well, how can I help?
-You wanna help?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.763
Let's start with a two-season pick up.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.642
Yeah, sure, pick-up, drop-off,
whatever works best for you.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.352
-That would be great.
-Great!

21:10.435 --> 21:11.687
[baby giggles]

21:11.770 --> 21:14.356
Well, here she is.
What time do you want me to pick her up?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.275
Wait, it's a baby?

21:16.358 --> 21:19.027
-And she has legs!
-[coos]

21:19.111 --> 21:21.571
I already canceled
"Milwaukee Waste Management."

21:21.655 --> 21:24.241
I told the shareholders
this was gonna save the network!

21:24.324 --> 21:26.702
-We designed the poster!
-[coos]

21:26.785 --> 21:30.330
Todd, we need a show. We can't air a baby!

21:30.414 --> 21:31.373
[blows raspberry]

21:31.456 --> 21:34.876
So, long story short,
Pinky canceled the baby,

21:34.960 --> 21:36.586
but now we owe him a TV show.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.046
Huh?

21:40.173 --> 21:42.134
So, the show is called "Birthday Dad."

21:42.217 --> 21:47.347
The pilot was directed by Flea Daniels,
and the show will be run by Karen Kitada.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.517
The creator of "Med School Nights"?
And "Med School Nights: The New Class,

21:50.600 --> 21:52.102
Med School Nights Goes to Law School"?

21:52.185 --> 21:53.645
-Uh...
-This show's about a dad

21:53.729 --> 21:55.105
who died on his birthday,

21:55.188 --> 21:58.275
and every episode,
his spirit visits a different

21:58.358 --> 22:01.320
intersectionally representative person
on their birthday

22:01.403 --> 22:03.530
to help them work
through their own issues.

22:03.613 --> 22:06.950
But how are all these characters related?
When does the show take place?

22:07.034 --> 22:08.452
How does Birthday Dad die?

22:08.535 --> 22:10.787
Those are mysteries we'll tease
all season!

22:10.871 --> 22:13.582
-Uh-huh.
-"Birthday Dad," you'll laugh, you'll cry,

22:13.665 --> 22:15.584
-you'll Birthday Dad!
-What do you think?

22:16.752 --> 22:19.296
Yeah, like I said, we'll take anything.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.176
[phone ringing, beeps]

22:24.468 --> 22:25.552
-Yeah?
-[BoJack] Hey.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.180
Um, so, I don't wanna waste any more
of your time.

22:28.263 --> 22:30.515
I just wanted to say that I know
you're really busy

22:30.599 --> 22:35.479
and I'm sorry for making your life
more difficult this week and also always.

22:35.812 --> 22:39.358
Also, I know that my apologies
are pretty much meaningless at this point,

22:39.441 --> 22:40.609
and I'm sorry for that, too.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.696
Why didn't you tell me
about the "Friends and Family Meetings"?

22:44.780 --> 22:47.449
I don't know. You got so much goin' on,
I didn't wanna bother you.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.159
I would have come.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.080
Okay. Thank you.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.082
[elevator dings]

22:56.375 --> 22:59.044
[pants] Did I miss it?
Is the "Do It All Ball" all done?

22:59.336 --> 23:01.922
Yes. We did it all.
Good of you to show up, by the way.

23:02.005 --> 23:05.092
Oh, yeah? Well, it's good of you to, uh...

23:05.384 --> 23:06.760
Shut up!

23:07.803 --> 23:09.054
[sighs]

23:09.221 --> 23:12.349
Are you okay?
You're not your usual medium-clever self.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.518
Can I ask you something?

23:15.185 --> 23:18.897
So, there's work, right?
I mean, work makes sense to me.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.065
And I'm good at it.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.195
I don't feel that way about my baby.

23:25.529 --> 23:29.574
I don't think
I'm feeling what I'm supposed to feel.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.326
What I thought I would feel.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.995
I mean, I love her, of course I do.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.624
Of course I love my daughter.
But... [sighs]

23:38.166 --> 23:42.546
But I don't know if I love her.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.841
I know I'm a terrible person
for even thinking it,

23:45.924 --> 23:49.469
but... what if it never happens?

23:50.095 --> 23:54.516
Do you love all your clients' projects?

23:54.599 --> 23:56.726
-Of course.
-No, you don't.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.645
But you take care of them
and you keep them alive

23:58.728 --> 24:00.814
-because that's your job, right?
-Yeah.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.441
So, now you've got a new job.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.735
And it is a ruthless one,
and I mean ruthless.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.738
You don't have time to waste
second-guessing how you feel about it.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.241
You just have to do it
the best that you can,

24:11.324 --> 24:12.951
and know that that's the best you can do.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.664
You know,
[scoffs] we have so much in common.

24:17.747 --> 24:20.792
I don't know why we've spent
so many years hating each other.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.003
I never hated you. Did you hate me?

24:23.086 --> 24:24.921
Uh... no.

24:26.756 --> 24:28.216
[cries]

24:28.300 --> 24:32.053
Hey. [shushes] Hey. Please. Listen.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.723
-Did you get the Fijis for the Fugees?
-[giggling]

24:34.806 --> 24:37.225
Yeah. Is that silly?

24:37.767 --> 24:41.062
The Fugees were egregious
when they got interviewed by Regis.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.315
[both giggling]

24:44.399 --> 24:46.109
Isn't that right...

24:46.735 --> 24:48.987
-Ruthie?
-[blows raspberry]

24:50.405 --> 24:52.324
[mellow music playing]
