[“Spiegel im Spiegel” plays]

08:07.420 --> 08:09.547
Hey, Gerry, the path.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.971
–God. It is so…
–[Urinating]

09:33.039 --> 09:34.874
Yeah.
It is really nice, man.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.535
Fresh air.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.109
–You ready?
–Nope.

09:49.689 --> 09:52.180
–Hi, guys.
–Hey.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.859
Hiking moms on the trail?

09:53.859 --> 09:56.762
It's just gonna be.
It's all tourists up there.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.559
Well, how far is the thing?

09:58.631 --> 10:01.100
We're halfway there.
Let's go this way, man.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.558
Everything's gonna lead
to the same place.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.287
–Just loop around?
–Yeah.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.432
Do our own fresh route?

10:08.975 --> 10:10.772
I can't believe that, like,

10:10.843 --> 10:12.845
fucking fanny packs
and sing-alongs

10:12.845 --> 10:14.347
the whole way to the thing.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.837
[Both laugh]

10:35.901 --> 10:39.564
[Singing softly]

11:13.571 --> 11:15.062
[Laughs]

11:24.050 --> 11:26.712
[Both laughing]

11:39.030 --> 11:42.023
[Both breathing heavily]

12:00.386 --> 12:02.683
[Exhales deeply]

12:06.926 --> 12:09.190
[Breathing heavily]

12:13.766 --> 12:15.597
[Laughs]

12:20.639 --> 12:22.799
[Exhales deeply]

12:34.754 --> 12:38.281
Fuck it, dude.
Fuck this.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.059
–Fuck the thing?
–Fuck the thing.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.511
Power on to the thing!

12:41.560 --> 12:43.857
–Fuck the thing.
–Fuck the thing!

12:43.929 --> 12:46.227
[Both breathing heavily]

12:46.298 --> 12:48.567
It's just gonna be
a fuckin' thing at the end.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.236
–Fuck the thing!
–Fuck the thing.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.827
Let's go back.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.354
Fuck the thing.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.059
[Spits]

14:06.011 --> 14:07.808
Hey, is this the way we…

14:14.854 --> 14:16.255
Yeah. That's it.
Right?

14:16.255 --> 14:17.916
Yeah.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.809
Hold on.
Is this the way we were going?

15:11.043 --> 15:13.068
–Yeah. This is it.
–Yeah.

15:23.789 --> 15:25.450
So…

15:27.927 --> 15:30.691
She thought it was a "Y“?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.598
–Who? The contestant?
–Yeah.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.963
Yep.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.395
She had every letter
except for the ”L“.

15:37.469 --> 15:44.772
She had ”B-A-R-R-E,“
blank, ”l-N-G

15:44.843 --> 15:47.744
down the road."

15:47.813 --> 15:50.748
“B-A-R-R-E,” blank,
“l-N-G down the road.”

15:50.816 --> 15:54.320
And all she had was "L“
for ”barreling down the road.“

15:54.320 --> 15:58.017
And they were like, ”Do you
want to solve the puzzle?“

15:59.458 --> 16:01.026
Because you have to when…

16:01.026 --> 16:03.362
When you have one letter left,
you have to solve.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.064
You're not allowed…
[Laughs]

16:05.064 --> 16:09.626
Because you're only spinning
to drive up your earnings.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.794
Right.

16:10.869 --> 16:14.433
So it's like cheating if there's
only one letter left.

16:15.841 --> 16:19.902
And so they told her
to solve it, and she said…

16:19.979 --> 16:21.695
”Barreying down the road?“

16:21.747 --> 16:22.941
[Both laugh]

16:23.015 --> 16:25.250
And there's this
really uncomfortable pause,

16:25.250 --> 16:29.516
and Sajak was like, ”No.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.818
Kenny?“

16:31.890 --> 16:33.540
And the next dude did it.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.595
But for zero dollars
because he couldn't spin.

16:36.628 --> 16:39.756
He was just like,
”Barreling down the road.“

18:52.898 --> 18:54.263
I hate you.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.494
[Both laugh]

19:01.373 --> 19:04.035
–Not really, though, right?
–Not really.

19:04.109 --> 19:08.170
It's just really hot on my front
and really cold on my back.

19:18.056 --> 19:22.959
There's a man
perched on the ledge…

19:23.028 --> 19:24.791
10 feet in front of us.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.922
Don't look.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.266
I see you, man.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.861
Do you hear that?

19:37.609 --> 19:41.045
There's a lot of dinosaurs
near here.

20:01.066 --> 20:04.092
I conquered Thebes.

20:04.169 --> 20:05.261
When?

20:05.337 --> 20:07.965
[Inhales deeply]

20:08.040 --> 20:09.905
Two weeks ago.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.801
How'd you do it?

20:15.447 --> 20:20.077
Well, I got…
I did more than that, actually.

20:20.152 --> 20:23.280
I said to Gerry…
[Clears throat]

20:23.355 --> 20:28.554
”I ruled this land
for 97 years, and…"

20:32.931 --> 20:36.890
“…and I'd like it.”

20:38.971 --> 20:45.274
I had all the sanctuaries built,
and then I…

20:45.344 --> 20:48.211
This hot lava leaked out
of a volcano

20:48.280 --> 20:54.310
and half destroyed my sanctuary
to Demeter, I guess it was.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.354
And…

20:58.290 --> 21:02.852
But I didn't have the marble to
rebuild, like, the sculptures

21:02.928 --> 21:05.862
and that to fix the sanctuary.

21:05.931 --> 21:10.095
But I already had
all these docks

21:10.168 --> 21:14.264
to, like, Calydon
and Argos and…

21:14.339 --> 21:17.570
I had everything.
Everything.

21:17.643 --> 21:20.635
I was trading
with, like, 12 cities

21:20.712 --> 21:22.509
and…

21:23.949 --> 21:27.214
I had a really good army.

21:27.285 --> 21:31.484
But the river had just flooded.

21:31.556 --> 21:34.092
And it flooded out,
like, four of my docks,

21:34.092 --> 21:38.620
and I couldn't import the marble
to rebuild the sanctuary.

21:38.697 --> 21:42.459
Demeter got pissed off, and
she made my fields infertile.

21:42.501 --> 21:44.264
And then…

21:44.336 --> 21:46.304
So I couldn't grow the grass.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.940
I couldn't grow the wheat
to feed the horses.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.568
And there was no…
I couldn't…

21:51.643 --> 21:55.807
And there was nowhere
for the sheep to graze.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.283
And some of my people were
growing hungry and restless,

21:58.283 --> 22:00.615
and then…

22:02.853 --> 22:06.286
And I couldn't trade
because the rivers had flooded.

22:06.325 --> 22:10.318
And so, Knossos,
one of my vassals,

22:10.395 --> 22:15.332
got really upset with me
and turned against me.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.166
And they… attacked me.

22:19.236 --> 22:21.473
And because I couldn't
train any sheep

22:21.473 --> 22:23.703
'cause I didn't have the wheat.

22:23.775 --> 22:27.711
I didn't have…

22:27.779 --> 22:30.770
I didn't have a, um, a…

22:30.849 --> 22:32.284
You couldn't train sheep?

22:32.284 --> 22:35.487
I couldn't train the horses
because I didn't have wheat.

22:35.487 --> 22:39.821
And so when they attacked me,
they just dogged me.

22:39.891 --> 22:43.161
And I actually went to send
my army out to defend the city,

22:43.161 --> 22:49.100
and you can only send them out
if you have 12 trained horses,

22:49.167 --> 22:50.896
and I had 11.

22:50.969 --> 22:56.430
So I was one horse shy…

22:58.677 --> 23:01.237
of almost saving my city.

23:02.147 --> 23:04.615
So then you didn't really…

23:04.683 --> 23:09.915
Oh, I had just conquered Thebes,
and then that happened.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.719
All right.

23:43.789 --> 23:47.782
You go to that one,
and I'll go to this one.

23:47.858 --> 23:49.258
All right.

25:05.971 --> 25:07.962
[Grunts]

25:12.777 --> 25:14.142
Hey.

25:14.212 --> 25:15.611
Hey.

25:16.281 --> 25:18.146
You see anything?

25:21.052 --> 25:22.576
Big hills.

25:22.654 --> 25:24.144
Yeah.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.224
Uh, re-split up.

25:32.297 --> 25:33.992
All right.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.035
All right, see the ravine?

25:37.035 --> 25:38.798
Yeah.

25:38.869 --> 25:40.235
That's the spot.

25:40.305 --> 25:42.841
So you go to the next one,
I'll go to the next one.

25:42.841 --> 25:46.010
If you don't find anything,
we meet back right there.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.580
If you find something,
fuck the spot, I'll find you.

25:48.580 --> 25:52.474
Higher hilltop, meet at spot.
Or fuck the spot, wait there.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.713
–Yeah.
–Roger.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.713
Gerry!

29:19.491 --> 29:21.982
Gerry!

29:27.831 --> 29:30.630
Gerry!

29:34.105 --> 29:35.834
[Sighs]

29:42.113 --> 29:44.513
[Echoing]
Gerry! Gerry!

29:44.582 --> 29:45.810
Hey!

29:47.085 --> 29:48.552
Hey.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.222
What are you doing?

29:56.294 --> 29:57.591
What?

29:57.662 --> 29:59.931
You're supposed to go on
a high-hill scout-about.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.366
You're on a rock in a canyon.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.561
I did.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.899
Yeah, did you see anything?

30:07.805 --> 30:09.967
No, did you?

30:10.041 --> 30:11.702
No.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.572
Well, what are
you doing on the rock?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.618
Looking for you.

30:22.387 --> 30:25.049
Why didn't you
just go to the spot?

30:25.123 --> 30:27.114
I did.
You weren't there.

30:27.192 --> 30:30.059
I've been there.
I was just sitting there.

30:30.862 --> 30:32.853
Dude, that's not the spot.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.867
The spot is, like,
a half of a mile that way.

30:35.867 --> 30:38.069
I was at the spot.
I was waiting for you forever.

30:38.069 --> 30:40.003
I was yelling your name.

30:40.071 --> 30:44.167
And I just came walking up here,
and I saw the rock.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.911
I crow's-nested up here
to scout-about the ravine

30:46.911 --> 30:50.211
'cause I thought maybe you
gerried the rendezvous.

30:51.216 --> 30:55.016
Sure enough, I mean,
that's not the spot.

30:58.389 --> 30:59.856
All right, my fault.

30:59.924 --> 31:02.051
[Laughs]

31:02.126 --> 31:03.394
Well, if you had assumed that,

31:03.394 --> 31:05.196
then you should've gone
to the top of my mountain

31:05.196 --> 31:06.631
because the whole plan was

31:06.631 --> 31:10.567
if one guy finds something,
then you go to his mountain.

31:10.635 --> 31:12.000
No, I know the plan,

31:12.070 --> 31:15.597
but I saw you coming down
when I was on the way down,

31:15.673 --> 31:19.973
and when you never showed up,
I thought maybe you'd succumbed.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.680
I almost did succumb,
but then I turbaned up,

31:22.680 --> 31:24.477
and I feel a lot better.

31:25.483 --> 31:27.542
Come on, dude, let's go.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.818
I can't.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.379
Why not?

31:34.459 --> 31:36.552
Fucking marooned.

31:36.628 --> 31:37.788
Come on.

31:37.862 --> 31:40.364
You're not rock-marooned.
Just climb down.

31:40.364 --> 31:44.096
But I am rock-marooned.
I can't climb down.

31:44.168 --> 31:47.069
I'm gonna have to jump.

31:47.138 --> 31:48.730
Hold on.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.977
How do you get up to that part?

31:58.950 --> 32:00.645
Scramble.

32:02.553 --> 32:05.647
[Rocks rolling]

32:38.656 --> 32:40.647
Jesus.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.362
[Grunts]

32:48.433 --> 32:50.833
How the fuck did
you get up here?

33:21.231 --> 33:23.325
Such a bear.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.665
I think you gotta jump.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.434
I can't jump,
I'll break my ankle.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.213
You'll have to barrel out
of here and get help,

33:35.213 --> 33:37.272
and I'll just be sitting there.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.658
[Sighing]
All right, I'll jump.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.591
No, no, no, no.

33:54.698 --> 33:56.767
You're gonna
twist an ankle or something,

33:56.767 --> 33:58.497
and then we're fucked.

34:01.406 --> 34:05.206
[Clears throat]
Well…

34:05.276 --> 34:07.744
Is it really crumbly there?

34:07.812 --> 34:09.143
Like, the ledge?

34:09.213 --> 34:10.612
Yeah.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.347
I mean, I could try and…

34:19.123 --> 34:21.630
Why don't you
make me a dirt mattress?

34:23.628 --> 34:25.618
No, Gerry.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.003
Come on, dude, I crow's-nested
all the way up here

34:32.003 --> 34:35.639
to scout-about the ravine 'cause
you gerried the rendezvous.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.972
[Laughs]

34:39.310 --> 34:42.080
If I hadn't we'd be split.
We'd still be re-split.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.915
Dude, just jump.
You'll be all right.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.650
I won't be all right, Gerry.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.016
[Both laughing]

34:50.521 --> 34:53.319
Well, I could try
and break your fall.

34:58.629 --> 35:02.121
[Rocks rolling]

35:02.200 --> 35:03.835
–Jump on your head?
–Like the circus, dude.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.497
No, not on my head,
with my arms.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.942
Didn't you ever go
to Barnum's, dude?

35:10.942 --> 35:12.261
They have a fat guy.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.712
He's got huge arms,
and he catches people

35:14.712 --> 35:17.545
from, like, 50 feet.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.583
All right, you ready?

35:19.650 --> 35:21.352
No, I'm gonna break your arms.

35:21.352 --> 35:23.582
Just make me a dirt mattress.

35:28.192 --> 35:31.184
–Where do you want it?
–Right there.

35:33.898 --> 35:36.298
All right.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.870
[Whistling]

35:59.056 --> 36:01.490
Well, I gotta haul the dirt.

36:03.561 --> 36:05.552
Well, get hauling.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.501
I can haul it from over here.

36:15.473 --> 36:18.033
–Shirt basket?
–Shirt basket.

36:28.653 --> 36:30.621
Yeah, it's crumbly.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.254
–Is it soft?
–Yeah, soft.

36:35.326 --> 36:38.489
It's like…
It feels hard, but it's…

36:38.563 --> 36:41.293
You know, it's like dust.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.855
Yeah.

37:08.459 --> 37:10.825
You're gonna take forever,
Gerry.

37:14.298 --> 37:19.031
I'll get all this stuff
up to it also.

37:19.103 --> 37:22.470
I mean, all you really need
is, like, a two-by-two…

37:22.540 --> 37:24.872
like, air-ram dirt mattress.

37:24.942 --> 37:27.178
Just to put your feet
'cause that'll cushion it,

37:27.178 --> 37:29.976
and then you'll
probably fall forward.

37:30.047 --> 37:34.074
So if I clear,
like, your head area…

37:34.151 --> 37:38.679
and then make, like,
a little, like, a dirt box.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.656
You know how to rig that?

37:40.725 --> 37:42.283
Yeah.

37:51.969 --> 37:54.733
See, this is already,
like, a foot.

37:54.805 --> 37:57.171
If I can get it
to, like, two feet…

38:40.785 --> 38:45.313
And that's a good angle, right?
Think you can hit that, right?

38:45.389 --> 38:47.725
I mean, I'm not done yet,
but, I mean, you…

38:47.725 --> 38:50.125
–Where it is, is good.
–Yeah.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.793
Ah, that's great.

40:01.432 --> 40:06.165
You really only need it to hit
with two feet in one spot.

40:07.204 --> 40:09.638
So if we can get the spot,

40:09.707 --> 40:13.700
and if you can hit it,
that's all the cushion you need.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.109
How's that?

40:26.490 --> 40:27.889
No?

40:31.862 --> 40:33.798
Look, it's not gonna be
comfortable,

40:33.798 --> 40:36.028
but it's not a knee-breaker.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.102
How many feet
do you think it is?

40:38.102 --> 40:39.296
150.

40:39.370 --> 40:41.338
[Laughing]

40:41.405 --> 40:42.702
It's what?

40:42.773 --> 40:45.241
Here, I'll get more,
I'll get more.

41:14.038 --> 41:15.972
That's pretty good.

41:18.676 --> 41:21.611
I don't know if I can do it.

41:24.448 --> 41:24.453
[Exhales sharply]

41:28.400 --> 41:30.060
You okay?

41:30.701 --> 41:32.760
Yeah.
[Breathing heavily]

41:32.837 --> 41:34.805
What time do you think it is?

41:34.872 --> 41:36.931
That was far.

44:05.719 --> 44:07.414
Here.

44:09.155 --> 44:11.350
Animal tracks.

44:12.359 --> 44:13.849
Follow these to water.

44:13.927 --> 44:17.192
Animals have to know
where the water is out here.

44:18.031 --> 44:20.066
Then we follow them
to the water,

44:20.066 --> 44:24.901
and we just drink our faces up.

44:24.971 --> 44:28.469
Or else they go to the mating
grounds, you know, and…

44:30.844 --> 44:32.711
And then they mate,
and they get thirsty,

44:32.711 --> 44:34.406
and they come back.

44:35.981 --> 44:38.040
All right, but, I mean, I…

44:42.388 --> 44:43.878
Yeah.

44:45.124 --> 44:47.226
We don't know how far
the water is, though.

44:47.226 --> 44:50.162
And I don't think we should
abandon the higher-ground idea,

44:50.162 --> 44:51.497
'cause it was a good idea.

44:51.497 --> 44:53.232
And that was a rolling hills
scout-about.

44:53.232 --> 44:55.100
And if we go on a mountain,
like, crow's-nesting,

44:55.100 --> 44:57.227
like that mountain over there…

44:59.405 --> 45:01.600
Yeah, but…

45:01.673 --> 45:03.675
We know where the water is now.

45:03.675 --> 45:06.542
We could just go there,
and then get water

45:06.612 --> 45:11.548
and then go on our mountain,
the mountaintop scout-about,

45:11.616 --> 45:13.948
after we've gotten water.

45:14.018 --> 45:15.853
I think the mountain's
a better idea

45:15.853 --> 45:19.118
because what if we go
to the mating grounds

45:19.190 --> 45:21.392
and they see us
and they get self-conscious,

45:21.392 --> 45:24.361
and then they don't mate?

45:24.429 --> 45:25.953
Then we'll just…

45:26.030 --> 45:28.157
And then
they won't get thirsty…

45:28.232 --> 45:29.534
Whichever way it is,

45:29.534 --> 45:32.136
if we go there,
and it's the mating grounds,

45:32.136 --> 45:35.902
then we'll just watch them
from a brush.

45:35.973 --> 45:38.509
They won't know we're there,
they won't have any body shame,

45:38.509 --> 45:40.678
and they'll mate,
and get thirsty,

45:40.678 --> 45:45.774
and then they'll come back,
and lead us to the water.

45:48.919 --> 45:50.978
All right.

46:36.765 --> 46:39.290
–[Both breathing heavily]
–Fuck this.

46:40.536 --> 46:43.096
I can't even
see the tracks anymore.

46:47.676 --> 46:49.109
Fuck 'em.

53:35.373 --> 53:37.671
[Grunts]

53:37.742 --> 53:40.676
[Breathing heavily]

56:05.018 --> 56:08.515
Do you think we should
just go over to that mountain?

56:19.532 --> 56:23.229
Just stop crying, man.

57:07.979 --> 57:09.503
Where you going?!

57:12.650 --> 57:14.630
[Voice breaking]
I don't know!

57:17.455 --> 57:19.422
You wanna help?!

59:27.014 --> 59:28.106
Fuck you.

59:28.182 --> 59:29.809
Fuck you.

01:01:12.984 --> 01:01:14.713
[Exhales deeply]

01:03:02.156 --> 01:03:05.751
We're walking north-northwest…

01:03:05.827 --> 01:03:07.692
for…

01:03:07.762 --> 01:03:11.163
a couple hours… a ways…

01:03:11.232 --> 01:03:13.701
But that's been the way we've
been walking the whole time.

01:03:13.701 --> 01:03:16.397
I mean, it's been
30 hours of walking.

01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:18.200
North-northwest.

01:03:20.108 --> 01:03:21.905
–Okay?
–Uh-huh.

01:03:21.976 --> 01:03:25.172
We've gotta be fucking close
to the highway.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:30.108
Yeah.
But we got lost.

01:03:30.183 --> 01:03:31.741
I mean, we were going…

01:03:31.818 --> 01:03:34.054
We walked our ways,
and maybe it was north.

01:03:34.054 --> 01:03:36.716
And then…

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:40.282
We came,
we turned around, and…

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.292
We got off…

01:03:41.361 --> 01:03:44.164
We started going straight back
down the way we were going.

01:03:44.164 --> 01:03:46.689
No, we didn't.
No, no, no, no.

01:03:46.766 --> 01:03:50.137
Before we turned around, we
started going down the same way.

01:03:50.137 --> 01:03:53.573
But we had turned before…

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.308
No, we didn't go
the same fuckin' way.

01:03:55.308 --> 01:03:59.938
We have not seen any
of the stuff that we've seen.

01:04:00.013 --> 01:04:03.413
We haven't passed
anything that looks familiar.

01:04:03.482 --> 01:04:05.784
Whatever our direction is,
it's not south,

01:04:05.784 --> 01:04:07.500
and it has not been south.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.080
We veered off
at a different point,

01:04:10.156 --> 01:04:12.158
and when
we started to come back,

01:04:12.158 --> 01:04:15.260
to go back, we started
back the exact same way.

01:04:20.466 --> 01:04:22.835
But we didn't see anything
that looked the same.

01:04:22.835 --> 01:04:26.032
We could have just
bailed early, you know.

01:04:26.105 --> 01:04:28.541
There were so many gerrys
along the way.

01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:30.839
We took a…
[Inhales sharply]

01:04:37.816 --> 01:04:39.784
I mean, we started
going back the same way,

01:04:39.784 --> 01:04:41.886
and then we stopped
and said it didn't look right,

01:04:41.886 --> 01:04:44.289
and then we went to the right
for a little while.

01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:47.425
So we were going east, all
right, which is a total gerry

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:51.054
because that's fucking
a million miles to a road.

01:04:51.129 --> 01:04:52.964
That's because we came up
over the thing,

01:04:52.964 --> 01:04:55.524
and we saw that whole layout.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.169
There was nothing there.
We didn't see anything.

01:04:58.169 --> 01:05:00.296
And then in the morning…

01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:13.318
In the morning, we walked north again.

01:05:13.318 --> 01:05:15.842
In the morning, we…
[Sighs]

01:05:15.919 --> 01:05:17.888
In the morning,
we definitely walked north.

01:05:17.888 --> 01:05:20.290
And then we gerried off
to the animal tracks,

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:21.348
which was east…

01:05:21.425 --> 01:05:24.326
which was west,
but it doesn't matter…

01:05:24.394 --> 01:05:26.530
When we hit the tracks,
we took a left,

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.430
which was going…

01:05:36.173 --> 01:05:37.574
…which was going west.

01:05:37.574 --> 01:05:40.611
But more importantly, when I
got up, when we split up,

01:05:40.611 --> 01:05:43.013
and I was walking up
on my scout-about,

01:05:43.013 --> 01:05:47.074
I was looking into the sun,
which means that it was east.

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:48.708
Um…

01:05:48.785 --> 01:05:51.685
So, and then,
when I was on the rock,

01:05:51.754 --> 01:05:54.382
and I was looking at you,
the sun was…

01:05:54.457 --> 01:05:56.559
When we came down,
we went in that direction.

01:05:56.559 --> 01:05:59.262
That means we were going east,
and we walked for a long time.

01:05:59.262 --> 01:06:02.298
And our scout-about was east,
so we gerried the scout-about.

01:06:02.298 --> 01:06:04.133
We went up
the wrong fuckin' mountain.

01:06:04.133 --> 01:06:06.601
Okay?

01:06:06.669 --> 01:06:08.971
So our direction's
been north-northeast,

01:06:08.971 --> 01:06:10.621
but if we spin the fucker

01:06:10.673 --> 01:06:13.836
and just go north,
balls-out north,

01:06:13.909 --> 01:06:16.112
we're gonna hit
the fuckin' highway

01:06:16.112 --> 01:06:17.875
because we can't go south.

01:06:17.947 --> 01:06:20.279
South is a fucking
disaster for us.

01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:23.253
It would take too fucking long
to get there.

01:06:23.319 --> 01:06:25.685
All right, then let's go north.

01:15:21.942 --> 01:15:23.534
[Exhales deeply]

01:15:24.845 --> 01:15:26.779
Come on, let's go.

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.245
We may as well just sit here.

01:15:42.628 --> 01:15:44.994
You know why
I think we should go?

01:15:52.705 --> 01:15:54.332
Why?

01:15:58.411 --> 01:16:00.504
Because I've got water.

01:16:06.819 --> 01:16:09.652
Come on, don't fuckin' joke.

01:16:10.523 --> 01:16:12.388
I'm not joking.

01:16:13.859 --> 01:16:15.793
I found water.

01:16:17.896 --> 01:16:20.626
I know exactly where the car is.

01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:27.896
[Sobbing]

01:16:34.946 --> 01:16:36.436
How?

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.020
Just figured it out.

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:51.428
It was another fuckin' mirage.

01:17:32.602 --> 01:17:34.365
It was a mirage.

01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:42.707
What are you doing?

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:53.783
I really wanted to…

01:17:53.856 --> 01:17:56.926
walk up to you and say I had
two bottles of water,

01:17:56.926 --> 01:17:59.417
and that I knew
where the car was.

01:17:59.495 --> 01:18:01.588
Come on, we gotta go.

01:18:14.476 --> 01:18:16.808
–Come on.
–[Groans]

01:28:24.169 --> 01:28:27.399
How do you think
the hike's going so far?

01:28:33.644 --> 01:28:35.976
[Chuckles]

01:28:41.152 --> 01:28:42.881
Pretty good.

01:28:42.954 --> 01:28:44.546
[Laughing]

01:29:21.157 --> 01:29:23.148
I'm leaving.

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:26.372
