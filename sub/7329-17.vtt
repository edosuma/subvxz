WEBVTT

00:29.230 --> 00:32.042
This is Fresh FM 94.7
in Washington.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.477
Speaking of rain, the weatherman

00:33.501 --> 00:35.479
tells us the rains
are going to continue to fall

00:35.503 --> 00:37.171
for the rest of the week.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.084
What, dear?

00:41.108 --> 00:42.252
You need to apologize to Mom.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.488
No, I will not apologize
to your mother.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.747
- She's going to leave.
- Well, good. Let her go home.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.352
- Will?! What was that?! What did I?!
- Can't talk.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.423
What the hell?

01:04.602 --> 01:06.366
Hold it right there!

01:52.480 --> 01:54.625
Jethro working you so hard

01:54.649 --> 01:56.526
you have to do your laundry
at the office?

01:56.550 --> 01:58.962
Stepped in a puddle.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.631
He did not watch
where he was walking.

02:00.655 --> 02:01.665
He was texting.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.767
Me. Tony thinks

02:03.791 --> 02:06.436
"probationary agent" means that
I'm his personal assistant.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.170
He wanted me
to pick up his latte.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.372
I was running late.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.774
That is your problem.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.042
I hate rain.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.511
I love it. I mean, rain is so

02:14.535 --> 02:16.713
invigorating, cleansing.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.781
It makes the air fresh

02:17.805 --> 02:18.949
and the city sparkle.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.984
Where is Jethro?

02:21.008 --> 02:22.452
I have no idea.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.388
Um, I think he's
in the building somewhere.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.189
Well, it can wait.

02:26.213 --> 02:27.724
Does anyone have any talc?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.526
This hurts.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.628
Hey. Would you just
take your foot

02:31.652 --> 02:32.812
to the locker room, please?

02:33.721 --> 02:35.365
Hey.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.800
Any of you notice
something different

02:36.824 --> 02:38.235
about Ducky?

02:38.259 --> 02:41.571
Yeah, he has seemed
awfully chipper as of late.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.173
Ducky does seem plucky.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.341
No one loves

02:44.365 --> 02:46.677
- rain in DC.
- No. His ties.

02:46.701 --> 02:48.578
He's been wearing tie ties,

02:48.602 --> 02:50.247
not his bow ties.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.782
Oh, that's very observant.

02:51.806 --> 02:54.351
Boss, hey, uh,
Ducky was looking for you.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.320
- What's he want?
- Uh, don't know,

02:56.344 --> 02:58.522
but he left something
for you on your desk.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.190
Let's go. Marine, shot.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.092
Rock Creek Park.

03:02.116 --> 03:05.762
Ooh. Oh, thanks, boss.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.186
Are these clean?
Of course they are.

03:10.091 --> 03:11.735
We searched the area.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.091
Found a nine-millimeter.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.253
Oh. Looky there.

03:24.739 --> 03:26.850
The FBI ERT,

03:26.874 --> 03:29.086
they removed a slug
from the vehicle.

03:29.110 --> 03:30.921
Well, good luck
finding any more.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.622
Yeah, a lot of muddy footprints.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.558
- Nothing that could be lifted.
- Well, get all the evidence.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.193
Collect it back
to our lab, will you?

03:36.217 --> 03:37.728
Hey, that's between
you and the FBI.

03:37.752 --> 03:39.363
We're not getting in
the middle of that.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.198
When did the Bureau
get involved?

03:41.222 --> 03:43.700
Well, we called them in
to assist with the ballistics.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.521
You find anything on the victim?

03:46.827 --> 03:48.271
Just what looked like
a house key.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.740
It was tied to his shoelaces.

03:49.764 --> 03:53.029
Really? Then how did you
ID Lieutenant Mayne?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.547
- Mobile fingerprint scanner.
- Whoa.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.149
Don't you guys use them?

03:59.173 --> 04:01.651
Well, I mean, they...
they're coming.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.820
They just haven't quite
been issued yet.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.389
- Can I give it a go?
- Yeah.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.258
- All right.
- Just put your thumb on the screen.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.726
Oh, hey, boss.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.561
How's he doing?

04:11.585 --> 04:12.896
Still in surgery.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.998
Park police, FBI
can clean up here.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.033
Let's get to the hospital.

04:16.057 --> 04:17.922
Timothy...
no middle name... McGee.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.573
You broke into a Metro PD
impound yard?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.008
What's the matter with you?

04:25.032 --> 04:27.344
Boss, that was supposed
to be expunged.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.247
Run Mayne's service record.
Notify next of kin.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.465
If you need me.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.585
Wife... Leah Mayne,
lives in Woodley Park.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.087
Oh, that's strange.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.588
What now, McGee?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.957
There must be something wrong
with your fingerprint scanner.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.359
According to his service record,

04:42.383 --> 04:43.860
Lieutenant Mayne is MIA.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.045
Went missing in Afghanistan
six years ago.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.141
Dr. Bailey, Post-Op.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.776
Dr. Bailey, Post-Op.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.211
Page me if there's any change.

05:01.235 --> 05:03.260
Yes, Doctor.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.484
When can we talk with him?

05:07.508 --> 05:08.652
I don't know.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.987
One bullet grazed his forehead.

05:10.011 --> 05:12.322
The other went deep
into his lower left abdomen.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.858
He's lost a lot of blood.
The slug is imbedded

05:14.882 --> 05:16.827
close to his spine.
It, uh, would be

05:16.851 --> 05:18.662
far too dangerous
to remove at this time.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.665
Ruth, would you keep his IV
at 75cc's per hour.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.350
- Yes, Doctor.
- Thank you.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.055
I'll let you know if there's
any changes, Agent Gibbs.

05:34.035 --> 05:36.480
This is surreal.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.715
I mean...

05:38.739 --> 05:41.503
After all these years,
not even a word.

05:42.977 --> 05:45.468
I just assumed that
my husband was dead and...

05:47.014 --> 05:48.659
and now you're telling me
that he's alive

05:48.683 --> 05:50.727
and that he's living
in Washington DC,

05:50.751 --> 05:51.728
but he's been shot.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.231
I mean, are you s... sure
that it was John?

05:54.255 --> 05:55.766
We have a fingerprint match,

05:55.790 --> 05:58.001
but we'd like you to make
a visual identification.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.227
- You okay with that?
- Uh...

06:03.497 --> 06:04.975
Yeah.

06:04.999 --> 06:06.364
Okay.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.093
Dr. Ollie to Nuclear Medicine.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.519
Dr. Ollie, Nuclear Medicine.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.390
Um, it looks like him.

06:34.628 --> 06:38.041
The last time I saw John,
he was...

06:38.065 --> 06:39.743
clean-shaven

06:39.767 --> 06:42.245
and he had a Marine buzz cut.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.681
Oh, he had a birthmark on his...

06:44.705 --> 06:45.983
- Hold on. Hang on.
- Oh, sorry.

06:46.007 --> 06:47.517
- Nurse, please.
- Oh.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.541
Sure.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.376
Brownish, circular?

06:59.020 --> 07:00.681
It's John.

07:04.025 --> 07:06.937
Where has he been
the last six years?

07:06.961 --> 07:10.260
I don't know,
but we're going to find out.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.077
You need a minute?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.262
- Thank you.
- Okay.

07:21.342 --> 07:22.819
Stay here.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.655
If he regains consciousness,
call me, and see if you can

07:25.679 --> 07:27.090
get any more out of her.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.959
You subscribing
to the DiNozzo Theory...

07:28.983 --> 07:30.143
always suspect the wife?

07:38.059 --> 07:41.586
I'm at the hospital...

07:52.406 --> 07:55.018
Do you know of any
of his friends?

07:55.042 --> 07:56.737
Okay. What do we got?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.623
Six years ago,

07:59.647 --> 08:02.092
Lieutenant Mayne was part
of a three-man deep cover

08:02.116 --> 08:03.794
recon mission in Afghanistan.

08:03.818 --> 08:05.095
He went missing.

08:05.119 --> 08:06.963
- All right. Thanks very much.
- The other two team members were.

08:06.987 --> 08:10.867
Captain Gordon Holcomb
and Sergeant Matthew Gontz.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.069
Holcomb's still in the military.

08:12.093 --> 08:13.570
He's a major now,
stationed in Quantico.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.372
He's coming in tomorrow morning.

08:15.396 --> 08:18.041
Gontz was honorably discharged

08:18.065 --> 08:20.077
five years ago.
Still haven't found him,

08:20.101 --> 08:21.745
though we do know that
he went through a divorce

08:21.769 --> 08:23.647
and a series of jobs.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.182
I think he's having
a little trouble

08:25.206 --> 08:26.616
adjusting to civilian life.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.685
Well, I am going
to try and track him down

08:28.709 --> 08:30.301
through Social Security
Administration.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.226
Oh... a thirsty little boy.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.296
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.331
Yeah, we're gonna
get you some water

08:41.355 --> 08:42.879
and some food and love.

08:44.425 --> 08:47.003
Abbs. What's the dog doing here?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.806
- Gibbs, this is Mortimer.
- Mm-hmm.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.099
What's he doing here?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.212
I am an SVPR,

08:55.236 --> 08:57.414
a substitute
volunteer puppy raiser.

08:57.438 --> 09:00.117
Mortimer here is going to be

09:00.141 --> 09:01.818
a Seeing Eye dog one day,

09:01.842 --> 09:03.286
and you're going
to be the smartest boy

09:03.310 --> 09:05.655
in your whole class.
Yes, you are.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.943
Yes, you are.

09:09.450 --> 09:11.862
Okay, putting dog down now.

09:11.886 --> 09:14.498
Okay, so, uh... the gun.

09:14.522 --> 09:15.999
It is...

09:16.023 --> 09:20.137
unregistered, and has only
Lieutenant Mayne's prints on it.

09:20.161 --> 09:22.806
As you can see,
it is a nine-millimeter.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.276
There were two shots fired,
and 13 remain in the magazine.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.746
The slug that FBI ERT
pulled from the vehicle...

09:29.770 --> 09:31.148
it's too mangled to match,

09:31.172 --> 09:32.682
but it's definitely
bigger than a nine.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.551
Ducky talked to the doctor.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.720
Mayne's wounds
weren't self-inflicted.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.555
Looks like a shoot-out.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.123
Hey, what's going on with Ducky?

09:40.147 --> 09:41.992
He's acting very un-Ducky-like.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.494
Like-Like every day,
he leaves during lunch.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.029
He's never done that before.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.864
I mean, the Duck Man
is a creature of habit.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.856
He brings in his lunch.
He eats at his desk.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.536
Where is he going?

09:52.560 --> 09:54.571
I'm sure he's fine.

09:54.595 --> 09:58.032
Uh, Abby, don't let that dog
out of your sight.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.344
Mortimer! Ah.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.979
That's not your bone.

10:03.003 --> 10:06.340
Excuse me, uh, Matthew Gontz?

10:11.312 --> 10:13.623
Matthew Gontz?

10:13.647 --> 10:14.791
Yeah?

10:14.815 --> 10:17.127
NCIS. May we speak with you?

10:17.151 --> 10:20.330
What's this about?

10:20.354 --> 10:21.932
I've been out of
the Marine Corps for years.

10:21.956 --> 10:23.233
Yeah, we know.

10:23.257 --> 10:24.534
You've been hard to track down.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.803
Uh, we need to ask you about
a reconnaissance mission.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.105
The one where Lieutenant Mayne
went missing.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.074
You know I've told that story
a hundred times?

10:31.098 --> 10:32.861
Well, we need to hear
it for ourselves.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.746
It was just the three of us...

10:36.770 --> 10:39.082
me, Captain Holcomb,
Lieutenant Mayne.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.351
We were inserted
into a hostile environment.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.753
It was a keyhole mission.
Defensive weapons only.

10:43.777 --> 10:47.390
A-Am I cleared to tell
you guys this stuff?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.692
This was classified.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.117
We've been read
into the program.

10:51.986 --> 10:53.997
Our mission was to place
and recover

10:54.021 --> 10:55.699
remote target sensors
in Mazar-e.

10:55.723 --> 10:56.933
Everything went
according to plan,

10:56.957 --> 10:58.935
until we made for
the exit rendezvous.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.004
That's when Lieutenant Mayne
broke his leg.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.906
How did it happen?

11:02.930 --> 11:04.207
We were coming over a wall

11:04.231 --> 11:06.276
in a small village
just outside of town.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.411
He snagged his KA-BAR sheath
on some barbed wire,

11:08.435 --> 11:09.412
and he fell.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.114
It wasn't his day.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.383
Did you leave him behind?

11:13.407 --> 11:16.553
No. Captain Holcomb and myself
stashed him in the basement

11:16.577 --> 11:19.022
of an abandoned building while
we went to commandeer a vehicle.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.590
When we came back,

11:20.614 --> 11:22.759
he wasn't there.
We assumed he was captured.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.096
So you and Captain Holcomb
went to the exit rendezvous?

11:26.120 --> 11:27.097
We had to.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.932
We followed mission protocol.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.601
Look, I've never
forgiven myself for leaving

11:31.625 --> 11:32.969
a team member behind.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.205
Must be tough.

11:35.229 --> 11:36.873
The Marine Corps tore
the country upside down

11:36.897 --> 11:38.194
looking for Mayne.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.944
Look, are we done?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.646
I gotta clock in.

11:42.670 --> 11:44.228
For now.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.585
Wait.

11:48.609 --> 11:52.822
Um... why's all this
coming up again?

11:52.846 --> 11:55.625
John Mayne is no longer MIA.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.460
He showed up yesterday morning.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.712
He was shot.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.332
I don't believe it.

12:02.356 --> 12:04.634
Where'd it happen?

12:04.658 --> 12:06.936
Right here in DC.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.438
You have any indication
he was alive

12:08.462 --> 12:09.606
over the past six years?

12:09.630 --> 12:12.909
The last time I saw him
was in Mazar-e.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.512
His KA-BAR sheath got snagged
on some barbed wire.

12:15.536 --> 12:17.347
He broke his leg.

12:17.371 --> 12:18.770
Just wasn't his day.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.421
Yeah, Gibbs.

12:24.445 --> 12:26.489
Boss, Lieutenant Mayne's awake.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.310
Be right there.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.662
Did you have any contact

12:32.686 --> 12:34.831
with Sergeant Gontz
since Afghanistan?

12:34.855 --> 12:38.268
No. The mission really
shook him badly.

12:38.292 --> 12:41.838
I lost track with him
after he got discharged.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.240
Has he been told Mayne's alive?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.164
Yes, he has.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.145
Two milligrams of plurazepam.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.847
- Call me if there's any change.
- Will do, Doc.

12:50.871 --> 12:51.848
Just keep me posted.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.283
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:53.307 --> 12:54.951
He's conscious,
which is a good sign,

12:54.975 --> 12:56.052
but he's incoherent.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.554
Worst thing for him right now is

12:57.578 --> 12:58.888
to be bombarded with questions.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.323
I'm gonna keep him sedated.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.692
Uh, for how long?

13:02.716 --> 13:04.661
It's too early to tell.

13:04.685 --> 13:05.995
Wheelchair to Admitting...

13:06.019 --> 13:07.646
Special Agent Gibbs...

13:09.056 --> 13:10.333
My name's Rachel Wells.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.502
I was told by police to see you.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.371
About what?

13:14.395 --> 13:15.939
My husband.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.974
He went jogging
yesterday morning,

13:17.998 --> 13:19.809
never returned home.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.311
When I reported him missing

13:21.335 --> 13:23.480
and showed his picture
to police, they

13:23.504 --> 13:25.335
directed me here.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.402
You're married to John Mayne?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.591
No, his name's Christian Wells.

13:35.616 --> 13:38.050
No, his name is John,
and he's my husband.

13:48.462 --> 13:49.840
There you go. Careful.

13:49.864 --> 13:52.009
I met Christian
two years ago -Thanks.

13:52.033 --> 13:53.677
On a track at Georgetown.
Thanks.

13:53.701 --> 13:54.945
We're both runners.

13:54.969 --> 13:57.714
We, um, smiled and nodded

13:57.738 --> 13:58.815
for about a month,

13:58.839 --> 14:01.685
and then went for coffee,

14:01.709 --> 14:02.977
then started dating.

14:08.783 --> 14:10.961
How long you been married?

14:10.985 --> 14:12.976
Just over a year.

14:14.522 --> 14:17.934
Last Christmas in Hawaii,
we eloped.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.836
You met his family?

14:19.860 --> 14:21.304
He doesn't have any family.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.819
Christian's an only child,
and both his parents are dead.

14:26.634 --> 14:28.612
But you're probably gonna tell
me that that's

14:28.636 --> 14:29.780
not true either.

14:29.804 --> 14:31.715
His name's John Mayne.

14:31.739 --> 14:35.175
He went MIA in Afghanistan
six years ago.

14:37.011 --> 14:39.856
Your husband have a job?

14:39.880 --> 14:42.059
He day-trades,

14:42.083 --> 14:44.661
manages his portfolio.

14:44.685 --> 14:47.711
Christian inherited
a lot of money, so...

14:49.523 --> 14:51.368
I mean, that's not why
I married him.

14:51.392 --> 14:53.804
You're a runner, right?

14:53.828 --> 14:55.072
Yeah.

14:55.096 --> 14:58.208
How come the two of you
didn't go running

14:58.232 --> 14:59.529
yesterday morning together?

15:00.568 --> 15:03.404
I've been nursing a hamstring.

15:07.541 --> 15:09.686
You know, I should
probably get back upstairs

15:09.710 --> 15:11.321
to my husband.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.212
You know he was meeting someone
in the park yesterday?

15:16.484 --> 15:17.928
No.

15:17.952 --> 15:20.682
Do you know he owned a gun?

15:22.523 --> 15:24.684
He had it with him.

15:31.065 --> 15:33.210
The district does not take
fingerprints

15:33.234 --> 15:34.644
when issuing a driver's license.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.847
That is why Christian Wells'
name does not come up

15:36.871 --> 15:37.881
on the scan.

15:37.905 --> 15:40.283
The records reflect
his arrival in the

15:40.307 --> 15:42.219
Virginia-Maryland area
five years ago.

15:42.243 --> 15:43.520
Nothing prior.

15:43.544 --> 15:46.523
Lieutenant Mayne has obviously
constructed a new life.

15:46.547 --> 15:47.991
I found a whole lot

15:48.015 --> 15:49.693
of bank and brokerage accounts
in Christian Wells' name.

15:49.717 --> 15:51.561
Look at that, boss.

15:51.585 --> 15:54.297
This one mutual account alone,
he has over $5 million in.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.833
From what I found so far,

15:56.857 --> 15:58.401
his net worth is over
$12 million.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.470
- Where'd the money come from?
- Uh, don't know yet,

16:00.494 --> 16:02.439
but we are not the only ones
checking him out.

16:02.463 --> 16:06.376
The last two weeks, someone ran
multiple credit checks on Wells.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.778
- You got a name?
- I do.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.248
Peter Iger
of Iger Investigations.

16:11.272 --> 16:13.116
He's a P.I. I got the
voice mail, left a message.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.185
Good. Keep working
the source of the money.

16:15.209 --> 16:16.767
Ziva, track down Iger.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.825
- Yeah.
- Keep the IV as is.

16:21.849 --> 16:23.226
Call me with an update
in an hour.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.562
- Can I talk to him now?
- Absolutely not.

16:25.586 --> 16:26.763
He seems coherent.

16:26.787 --> 16:28.431
Barely.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.500
Just a couple of questions, Doc.

16:30.524 --> 16:32.202
I'm sorry. He's not out
of the woods yet.

16:32.226 --> 16:34.070
I don't want him upset.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.640
Have you informed
the wife of his condition?

16:36.664 --> 16:37.641
Which one?

16:37.665 --> 16:40.510
It's quite a dilemma, isn't it?

16:40.534 --> 16:43.180
Dr. Tallridge,
I've waited long enough.

16:43.204 --> 16:44.748
I'd like to see my husband now.

16:44.772 --> 16:48.118
Ma'am, I was just telling
Agent DiNozzo that your...

16:48.142 --> 16:50.654
husband is still
in critical condition.

16:50.678 --> 16:51.788
If I let you into his room...

16:51.812 --> 16:53.023
Oh, no, no, no.

16:53.047 --> 16:54.958
If you let that bimbo
into my husband's room,

16:54.982 --> 16:56.660
I will sue this hospital
and you personally

16:56.684 --> 16:57.924
for everything that you've got.

17:03.657 --> 17:06.303
You ever been married, Doc?

17:06.327 --> 17:09.105
Twice, but never
at the same time.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.339
- Dark SUV.
- Got it.

17:10.364 --> 17:11.675
I'll be here...

17:11.699 --> 17:13.276
I'll be there as soon as I can.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.411
Thank you.

17:14.435 --> 17:16.346
Iger, the P. I?

17:16.369 --> 17:17.496
Yeah.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.152
Nice tie.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.222
Ah, thank you. I found it at the.

17:25.246 --> 17:27.089
Metropolitan Museum of Art
store in New York.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.224
Its design is based

17:28.249 --> 17:30.427
on the Golden Hoard of Bactria,

17:30.451 --> 17:32.662
unearthed from the tombs
at Tillya-tepe

17:32.686 --> 17:33.897
in northern Afghanistan.

17:33.921 --> 17:36.624
Well, I like the flowers...
or whatever they are.

17:37.858 --> 17:38.858
Gotta go.

17:39.860 --> 17:41.504
Duck?

17:41.528 --> 17:42.806
Oh, hey-ho.

17:42.830 --> 17:44.107
You looking for this?

17:44.131 --> 17:46.176
Ah, you did sign it. Thank you.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.378
Yeah. Where you going?

17:48.402 --> 17:49.679
I just need some personal time.

17:49.703 --> 17:52.649
A long weekend will suffice.

17:52.673 --> 17:55.552
Uh, if anything comes up,
Mr. Palmer can deal with it.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.887
If you need me,
I'm reachable on my cell phone.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.723
Duck, everything okay?

17:59.747 --> 18:01.825
Yeah, never better.

18:01.849 --> 18:03.126
Why do you ask?

18:03.150 --> 18:05.595
Half my team's worried
about you.

18:05.619 --> 18:08.632
Let me guess. Which half?

18:08.656 --> 18:11.625
Abby and Ziva.

18:15.896 --> 18:17.540
ICU tech,

18:17.564 --> 18:20.176
please report to the east wing
nurses' station.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.567
ICU tech, please report to
the east wing nurses' station.

18:38.352 --> 18:41.665
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

18:41.689 --> 18:42.932
How you feeling?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.659
Felt better.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.738
Who are you?

18:48.762 --> 18:49.739
That's a good question.

18:49.763 --> 18:52.776
I can see
you're thinking clearly.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.612
I'm Anthony DiNozzo,
special agent with NCIS.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.547
Like to ask you

18:57.571 --> 19:00.267
a couple of questions,
Lieutenant Mayne.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.941
Bet you haven't heard
that name in, what, six years?

19:07.014 --> 19:09.526
Listen, I don't want
to make you uncomfortable.

19:09.550 --> 19:12.052
Is it better if I call you
Christian Wells?

19:14.655 --> 19:16.466
Ooh, that got a response.

19:16.490 --> 19:19.069
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:19.093 --> 19:20.070
Maybe you're right.

19:20.094 --> 19:21.471
Maybe I'm just
a little confused.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.139
I wouldn't be the only one.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.808
Got two women
out in the waiting room.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.600
Both of them claim
to be your wife.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.413
Where'd you go
after Afghanistan?

19:30.437 --> 19:31.581
What are you doing in here?!-

19:31.605 --> 19:32.716
You're not supposed
to be in here!

19:32.740 --> 19:34.484
I was trying to fluff
his pillow.

19:34.508 --> 19:35.719
- He looked uncomfortable.
- You know what? Out!

19:35.743 --> 19:36.786
- What?
- Out, out!

19:36.810 --> 19:38.588
- Listen, I didn't do anything.
- It does not matter.

19:38.612 --> 19:39.923
You should know better.

19:39.947 --> 19:41.358
Everything's fine. She just,
you know, I went by...

19:41.382 --> 19:43.760
- There's not a problem.
- Dr. Tallridge to ICU.

19:43.784 --> 19:47.083
I just wanted to check on him,
ask him a few questions...

19:53.594 --> 19:55.605
What do you mean where am I?

19:55.629 --> 19:59.042
Yeah, well, I'm not happy
about it either.

19:59.066 --> 20:02.512
Well, what-what do you want me
to do, work miracles?

20:02.536 --> 20:05.004
I'm still parked
in front of her place.

20:06.073 --> 20:07.597
Yeah, yeah.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.254
No, he still hasn't shown.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.689
Hold on a second.

20:12.713 --> 20:13.723
Agent David?

20:13.747 --> 20:15.078
"Dav-eed."

20:18.218 --> 20:20.630
Look, I'll call you
the second I see him.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.919
Then e-mail it to me, Joey.
I'll take a look.

20:26.126 --> 20:27.437
Thanks for meeting me here.

20:27.461 --> 20:29.973
I haven't left this spot
in three days.

20:29.997 --> 20:32.776
Hmm, stakeouts are brutal.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.578
So, uh, what do you need?

20:35.602 --> 20:37.282
Why were you investigating
Christian Wells?

20:38.739 --> 20:41.618
Come on. We know you ran
credit checks on him.

20:41.642 --> 20:43.119
Yeah.

20:43.143 --> 20:43.954
Why?

20:43.978 --> 20:46.146
Client hired me.

20:52.953 --> 20:56.766
Sorry. Not him.

20:56.790 --> 20:59.135
So, who hired you
to find out about Wells?

20:59.159 --> 21:03.139
Guy had a Internet photo
of a marathon runner

21:03.163 --> 21:05.708
crossing the finish line,
thought it was somebody he knew.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.244
I... ran his registration
number through

21:08.268 --> 21:10.680
the marathon's database.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.449
Runner's name
was Christian Wells.

21:12.473 --> 21:13.950
He's not the person
the client was looking for.

21:13.974 --> 21:16.352
I tried to do a little more;
Check out his finances,

21:16.376 --> 21:17.687
didn't get anywhere.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.355
Took ten minutes.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.903
The easiest 500 bucks
I ever made.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.194
You should have dug deeper.

21:24.218 --> 21:25.276
Why?

21:26.954 --> 21:29.299
I need the name of your client.

21:29.323 --> 21:30.967
Come on. It's privileged.

21:30.991 --> 21:33.036
Privileged? Are you a lawyer?

21:33.060 --> 21:34.504
'Cause we're investigating
a shooting here.

21:34.528 --> 21:37.190
It will be no trouble
for me to get a subpoena.

21:38.232 --> 21:40.777
Who got shot?

21:40.801 --> 21:42.278
Can't talk right now.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.147
What happened?

21:44.171 --> 21:45.365
Give me a name.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.345
The guy who hired me
was Gordon Holcomb.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.793
Major Gordon Holcomb?

21:56.817 --> 21:58.394
Yeah.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.181
Think he was a marine.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.267
Doctor, he's coding.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.368
He's in V-fib.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.469
I'm going to start compressions.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.470
Susan, bag him.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.671
Can I get the pads?

22:08.695 --> 22:09.672
Charge it up to 200.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.708
- 200.
- Get those lines open.

22:11.732 --> 22:12.876
Okay, everybody, clear.

22:12.900 --> 22:14.377
- Clear.
- Clear.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.312
No response.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.914
Continue CPR. I'm going to page
Dr. Tallridge.

22:17.938 --> 22:19.716
Give epi one milligram, IV push.

22:19.740 --> 22:21.441
One milligram.

22:23.744 --> 22:26.990
Dr. Tallridge,
please report to ICU, stat.

22:27.014 --> 22:29.692
Wait, wait, wait. What-what
happened with my husband?

22:29.716 --> 22:31.694
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mayne,
but you need to stay here.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.029
What?

22:33.053 --> 22:34.853
- Everybody, clear. - Clear.
- Clear. - Clear.

22:36.757 --> 22:38.535
He's not responding, Doctor.

22:38.559 --> 22:40.003
We got asystole on the monitor.

22:40.027 --> 22:41.671
No change.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.686
We've lost him.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.583
Last month,
Major Holcomb hires a P.I.

22:53.607 --> 22:55.685
to track down a guy he thought
might be Lieutenant Mayne,

22:55.709 --> 22:57.721
but yesterday,
he acts completely shocked

22:57.745 --> 23:00.390
when you tell him that Mayne
is alive and here in DC.

23:00.414 --> 23:02.726
As much as I was thinking
one of the wives did it,

23:02.750 --> 23:04.261
this guy's looking
awfully guilty,

23:04.285 --> 23:07.030
and now that Mayne's dead,
guilty of murder.

23:07.054 --> 23:09.599
See, when Mayne went MIA
in Afghanistan, he was broke.

23:09.623 --> 23:11.801
He was, in '02,
making $3,300 a month.

23:11.825 --> 23:12.969
Six years later, he's Wells,

23:12.993 --> 23:15.505
and he's worth over $12 million.

23:15.529 --> 23:18.408
So, where'd it all come from?

23:18.432 --> 23:22.112
Well, unfortunately, I can only
trace the money back five years.

23:22.136 --> 23:24.247
It was, uh, transferred from
an offshore account in Neevis.

23:24.271 --> 23:25.431
Nevis.

23:26.807 --> 23:27.951
Freeze all his accounts.

23:27.975 --> 23:29.286
You got it, boss.

23:29.310 --> 23:31.321
It's dealer's choice.
Some people say "Nay-vis."

23:31.345 --> 23:33.590
"Nee-vis." "Ne-vis."
It's not really important.

23:33.614 --> 23:36.393
What's your gut tell you
on this?

23:36.417 --> 23:37.994
That there's a connection

23:38.018 --> 23:40.664
with what went down
in Afghanistan six years ago.

23:40.688 --> 23:43.500
You said Holcomb
and Gontz said the exact

23:43.524 --> 23:45.135
same words to describe
what happened?

23:45.159 --> 23:47.093
Oh, like they were
reading from a script.

23:49.663 --> 23:52.142
Check with our agents in Kabul.
See what they can dig up.

23:52.166 --> 23:53.367
Got it, boss.

23:54.602 --> 23:56.179
McGee.

23:56.203 --> 23:57.948
Security desk. We have
a Major Holcomb for you.

23:57.972 --> 24:00.250
Uh, yeah. Be right down.

24:00.274 --> 24:02.902
Major Holcomb is in the lobby.

24:05.379 --> 24:06.523
Thank you for coming in.

24:06.547 --> 24:07.958
No problem.

24:07.982 --> 24:09.359
Gave up on the stakeout.

24:09.383 --> 24:10.927
The client wouldn't pay
for any more time.

24:10.951 --> 24:12.162
Hope I helped.

24:12.186 --> 24:14.950
I didn't really tell
you anything new.

24:25.332 --> 24:27.334
You guys are really devious.

24:29.470 --> 24:31.370
Iger Investigations.

24:36.110 --> 24:38.355
So, why'd you hire the P. I?

24:38.379 --> 24:40.457
I was surfing the Internet.

24:40.481 --> 24:43.760
Came across a marathon.
Thought the runner

24:43.784 --> 24:45.795
in that picture looked
like John Mayne.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.810
So I wondered,
could he be alive?

24:49.089 --> 24:51.801
You spent $500
of your own money to hire

24:51.825 --> 24:53.870
a private investigator.

24:53.894 --> 24:55.805
You didn't mention that
yesterday.

24:55.829 --> 24:57.807
The investigator told me
it wasn't him.

24:57.831 --> 25:02.312
So, when you saw the photo,
why didn't you call the police?

25:02.336 --> 25:04.327
Why didn't you call us?

25:05.606 --> 25:07.651
Look, I never came to
terms with what happened

25:07.675 --> 25:09.653
on that op in Afghanistan.

25:09.677 --> 25:11.254
One of my men was left behind.

25:11.278 --> 25:13.256
I knew the chances
of that runner

25:13.280 --> 25:14.624
in the photograph
being Mayne were slim,

25:14.648 --> 25:16.626
so I did not want
to dredge everything up

25:16.650 --> 25:17.827
with the Marine Corps again.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.095
Trust me.

25:19.119 --> 25:21.498
If that private eye
told me Mayne was alive,

25:21.522 --> 25:23.217
I'd have come to you
in a second.

25:24.258 --> 25:26.055
Okay, yes.

25:28.529 --> 25:31.374
Something is amiss.

25:31.398 --> 25:36.028
You are even more of a mystery
than before, Lieutenant Mayne.

25:41.608 --> 25:45.789
So, this is the little rascal
I've heard so much about.

25:45.813 --> 25:46.923
Hi.

25:46.947 --> 25:48.925
Mortimer, meet Dr. Mallard.

25:48.949 --> 25:51.194
Hey, how about we
set a playdate with your

25:51.218 --> 25:52.362
mom's corgis? I mean, he needs

25:52.386 --> 25:53.797
to be socialized
with other dogs.

25:53.821 --> 25:55.031
We'll see.

25:55.055 --> 25:57.967
Did you match the slug
from the lieutenant's body?

25:57.991 --> 25:59.969
No. It was a.45.

25:59.993 --> 26:02.205
The gun they found at
the crime scene was a nine-mil.

26:02.229 --> 26:04.040
But there was definitely
a second weapon,

26:04.064 --> 26:05.041
like Gibbs suspected.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.343
Well, I have an anomaly, too.

26:06.367 --> 26:08.111
Gibbs told me that
I should have found

26:08.135 --> 26:09.913
that one of his legs
had been previously broken.

26:09.937 --> 26:13.016
But that's definitely
not the case.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.150
What are you looking at?

26:14.174 --> 26:15.719
Your tie.

26:15.743 --> 26:19.089
My neckwear seems to be
a source of fascination.

26:19.113 --> 26:20.256
Do you like it?

26:20.280 --> 26:21.611
Yes.

26:22.750 --> 26:25.295
But you're Ducky,
and Ducky wears bow ties.

26:25.319 --> 26:26.796
Change, Abby, change.

26:26.820 --> 26:30.100
The species must evolve
and adapt.

26:30.124 --> 26:31.701
Tell me, Mortimer...

26:31.725 --> 26:34.270
they say that it makes me
look younger.

26:34.294 --> 26:35.796
You look adorable.

26:37.097 --> 26:39.442
Hey, I'm gonna take Mortimer
to lunch, 'cause he needs

26:39.466 --> 26:40.710
to be exposed to restaurants.

26:40.734 --> 26:42.679
I heard of this new vegan
place. You want to join us?

26:42.703 --> 26:44.013
Uh, sorry. I can't.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.014
How about tomorrow?

26:45.038 --> 26:47.083
Uh, I have something planned.

26:47.107 --> 26:49.386
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to call Gibbs

26:49.410 --> 26:51.810
and tell him about
the lack of a broken leg.

26:53.781 --> 26:56.159
He's up to something, Mortimer.

26:56.183 --> 26:57.761
First, my husband's missing.

26:57.785 --> 26:59.796
Then I learn he's been shot.

26:59.820 --> 27:01.765
You and the hospital
won't let me see him.

27:01.789 --> 27:03.299
Now he's dead.

27:03.323 --> 27:06.136
And you keep insisting
he's someone he's not.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.405
I know that this is hard
for you to accept,

27:08.429 --> 27:11.107
but the man you married is
really Lieutenant John Mayne.

27:11.131 --> 27:12.876
You say that.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.477
I refuse to believe it.

27:14.501 --> 27:17.447
Before, we had a fingerprint ID.

27:17.471 --> 27:20.517
Now, we have a positive
DNA match.

27:20.541 --> 27:22.285
Oh, don't tell me they're
releasing Christian's body

27:22.309 --> 27:23.353
to that woman.

27:23.377 --> 27:25.388
Ma'am, at this point,
we're not planning

27:25.412 --> 27:27.023
to release his remains
to anyone.

27:27.047 --> 27:29.659
You know, this has become
a total nightmare.

27:29.683 --> 27:31.461
I tried to get cash
out of the ATM this morning,

27:31.485 --> 27:32.662
and was denied.
I mean, the bank says

27:32.686 --> 27:33.830
they've frozen
all of our accounts.

27:33.854 --> 27:37.467
The man you married was leading
a fraudulent life.

27:37.491 --> 27:38.935
Lieutenant Mayne's parents
are still alive.

27:38.959 --> 27:41.037
There was no inheritance.

27:41.061 --> 27:42.272
How am I supposed to live?

27:42.296 --> 27:43.840
D-Do I have to get
my lawyer involved?

27:43.864 --> 27:45.041
I don't know. You know what?

27:45.065 --> 27:46.709
You do whatever it is
you need to do, okay?

27:46.733 --> 27:48.044
Special Agent Sanchez,

27:48.068 --> 27:50.513
please escort Miss Wells
back down to the lobby.

27:50.537 --> 27:51.948
This way, ma'am.

27:51.972 --> 27:54.717
I'm not going away, Agent Gibbs.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.986
What'd you find out?

27:57.010 --> 27:58.154
Wow.

27:58.178 --> 28:01.624
About the time Mayne went MIA,
an Afghan drug lord

28:01.648 --> 28:03.293
claimed some Americans
stole millions from him.

28:03.317 --> 28:06.629
Maybe that's how poor Mayne
became rich Wells.

28:06.653 --> 28:08.631
His teammates were lying
about him breaking his leg.

28:08.655 --> 28:09.799
Okay. Let's get
them both back in here.

28:09.823 --> 28:11.568
Hang on. Let's go
to the cabdriver first.

28:11.592 --> 28:13.136
- He's the weak link.
- He is the weakest link.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.060
And I am on it, boss.

28:34.848 --> 28:36.183
They told me John Mayne died.

28:40.187 --> 28:42.332
Um, why was he killed?

28:42.356 --> 28:44.916
We think it had to do
with his money.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.071
He had money?

28:48.095 --> 28:50.029
Mm-hmm. Millions.

28:51.565 --> 28:53.157
Any idea how he got it?

28:54.868 --> 28:56.028
No.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.551
Well...

29:01.575 --> 29:05.306
we think that it was stolen
from this Afghan drug lord.

29:07.047 --> 29:10.026
Guy's been a guest at Gitmo
for the past six years.

29:10.050 --> 29:12.795
Claims that he was robbed...

29:12.819 --> 29:15.310
by Americans.

29:31.004 --> 29:32.782
Come on, man.

29:32.806 --> 29:34.671
What happened on that op?

29:38.845 --> 29:41.177
You help me, I'll help you.

29:46.653 --> 29:48.898
Our mission
was to plant sensors.

29:48.922 --> 29:49.899
We did.

29:49.923 --> 29:51.801
On the way out of the village,

29:51.825 --> 29:54.470
we took fire from his guards.

29:54.494 --> 29:56.739
They thought we were
after their money.

29:56.763 --> 29:58.875
We took them down,

29:58.899 --> 30:01.477
and then we found it.

30:01.501 --> 30:02.946
Oil drums.

30:02.970 --> 30:04.714
Five of them.

30:04.738 --> 30:06.316
Full of cash, U.S. bills.

30:06.340 --> 30:09.085
Me and Captain Holcomb
left Mayne to guard the money

30:09.109 --> 30:10.587
while we went
in search of a vehicle.

30:10.611 --> 30:12.822
When we came back, he was gone.

30:12.846 --> 30:16.259
So, when you were debriefed
is when you made up the story

30:16.283 --> 30:17.327
about the broken leg.

30:17.351 --> 30:20.218
We couldn't tell anyone
about the money.

30:22.356 --> 30:24.801
All these years,
I have felt so guilty.

30:24.825 --> 30:27.726
The lieutenant got captured
because we wanted that money.

30:30.764 --> 30:33.667
And he's alive.

31:26.787 --> 31:30.621
So, how long have you been
involved with Major Holcomb?

31:36.230 --> 31:38.221
Involved?

31:39.900 --> 31:43.913
After Gordon returned
from Afghanistan,

31:43.937 --> 31:45.615
he came by the house
to console me

31:45.639 --> 31:48.018
about John being MIA.

31:48.042 --> 31:51.154
He would just check in
on me every few months.

31:51.178 --> 31:52.756
And then,
three or four years ago,

31:52.780 --> 31:54.391
his marriage started
to fall apart.

31:54.415 --> 31:57.127
And things, they changed
between us, so...

31:57.151 --> 32:01.831
When you came to the hospital
to identify your husband,

32:01.855 --> 32:04.501
you made a phone call.

32:04.525 --> 32:06.670
Major Holcomb?

32:06.694 --> 32:10.607
Yes, Leah Mayne called me
from the hospital.

32:10.631 --> 32:13.276
Yes, she told me
John Mayne was alive

32:13.300 --> 32:15.045
before you brought me in.

32:15.069 --> 32:18.148
You didn't tell us you hired
a private investigator.

32:18.172 --> 32:20.163
When are you going
to stop lying?!

32:22.343 --> 32:24.988
I was just trying to protect
my career and marriage.

32:25.012 --> 32:28.591
Now, they're both over.

32:28.615 --> 32:33.563
Gordon stayed with his wife
for his children's sake.

32:33.587 --> 32:35.899
And you kept collecting

32:35.923 --> 32:38.868
your husband's Marine Corps pay
and allowances?

32:38.892 --> 32:40.804
Yes.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.039
You had no idea
your husband was alive.

32:43.063 --> 32:46.142
No. No. Not until you people
called me to the hospital.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.178
Where were you that morning?

32:48.202 --> 32:49.612
With Gordon.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.981
I told my wife

32:52.005 --> 32:53.616
I had to spend the night
in Quantico.

32:53.640 --> 32:57.153
Leah and I were in a hotel
in Falls Church.

32:57.177 --> 33:00.056
I know you don't have any reason
to believe me, but we had

33:00.080 --> 33:02.826
no idea John Mayne was alive
until you called her

33:02.850 --> 33:04.060
to the hospital.

33:04.084 --> 33:06.896
Their alibis are solid, boss.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.631
This was filmed just minutes

33:08.655 --> 33:10.567
before John Mayne was shot
in the park.

33:10.591 --> 33:11.801
The major paid in cash.

33:11.825 --> 33:12.969
Of course he did. He's married.

33:12.993 --> 33:15.071
And cell phone records confirm

33:15.095 --> 33:16.706
that they were both
in Falls Church.

33:16.730 --> 33:18.975
You are so quick
to suspect the wife.

33:18.999 --> 33:21.344
Still do. He's got two of them
and two lives.

33:21.368 --> 33:22.712
Which life got him killed?

33:22.736 --> 33:24.481
I'm thinking
it's the little hottie.

33:24.505 --> 33:26.583
Knew about
her husband's former life

33:26.607 --> 33:28.718
and stolen money.
Don't you think?

33:28.742 --> 33:30.754
I mean, she said she was
going running 'cause she

33:30.778 --> 33:31.755
had a bum hammy,

33:31.779 --> 33:33.189
but she was strutting
around pretty good

33:33.213 --> 33:34.290
last time I saw her.

33:34.314 --> 33:35.679
Let's find out where she was.

33:37.451 --> 33:39.562
What about Gontz, the cabdriver?

33:39.586 --> 33:41.264
He was the third man
in Afghanistan.

33:41.288 --> 33:43.867
Maybe he found out
Wells was Mayne

33:43.891 --> 33:45.926
and killed him
for double-crossing them.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.905
No.

33:48.929 --> 33:50.874
No. No more rain.

33:50.898 --> 33:52.509
Weatherman said it'd miss us.

33:52.533 --> 33:54.878
What do you care about? A little
rain's not going to hurt you.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.613
It's going to hurt my wallet.

33:56.637 --> 33:57.947
I just had my car washed.

33:57.971 --> 34:00.049
That is why I never wash my car
in the winter.

34:00.073 --> 34:01.217
That's a big mistake.

34:01.241 --> 34:02.986
You got to wash off
the deicing salt.

34:03.010 --> 34:05.410
Otherwise, it'll eat
through the undercarriage.

34:14.321 --> 34:16.766
McGee. Can you track
the cell phone number

34:16.790 --> 34:17.900
on this card and tell me

34:17.925 --> 34:19.803
where it was the morning
Mayne was shot?

34:19.827 --> 34:22.906
Peter Iger.
Iger Investigations. Sure.

34:22.929 --> 34:23.973
Ziva.

34:23.996 --> 34:25.574
What's the matter with you?

34:25.599 --> 34:26.708
He lied to me.

34:26.733 --> 34:29.245
Iger said he had not
left the stakeout

34:29.268 --> 34:30.380
for three days,

34:30.404 --> 34:33.216
but his car was spotless
on the outside.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.935
I could see my reflection.

34:36.577 --> 34:38.254
Well, sorry, Ziva.
Can't help you.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.290
Iger's phone was
turned off that morning.

34:40.313 --> 34:41.925
I do not believe it.
He is always on it.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.226
The man practically has a wire
growing out of his ear.

34:44.251 --> 34:46.161
He would never turn
it off, Gibbs.

34:46.186 --> 34:48.063
Unless he didn't want
to leave an electronic trail.

34:48.088 --> 34:51.425
Hang on a second.
His phone on now?

34:53.193 --> 34:54.838
Uh, yes, it is.

34:54.862 --> 34:56.056
Where?

35:03.470 --> 35:06.496
Not far from here. 1200 block
of M Street Northwest.

35:16.316 --> 35:18.361
He's not here.

35:18.385 --> 35:20.964
He's got to be
around here somewhere.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.182
I'm gonna call Ziva.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.271
What did Iger say?

35:28.295 --> 35:30.874
Uh, Iger's not here.
Listen, could you go to my desk?

35:30.898 --> 35:33.476
There's a cell tracker
with Iger's phone on it.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.912
Just, uh, tell me where he is.

35:35.936 --> 35:38.448
There is a laptop in the,
uh, passenger seat there.

35:38.472 --> 35:40.283
I'd love to get a look.

35:40.307 --> 35:44.220
Well, his phone is now north
of M Street on Ridge.

35:44.244 --> 35:46.523
Address indicates
it is a restaurant.

35:46.547 --> 35:48.324
All right. He's, uh, a block up,

35:48.348 --> 35:49.492
around the corner. He's eating.

35:49.516 --> 35:51.528
Perfect. I'll get the Slim Jim.

35:51.552 --> 35:52.662
No. Hey, hey. What?

35:52.686 --> 35:53.796
We don't have a warrant.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.899
And I have a record,
and besides,

35:55.923 --> 35:57.667
a Slim Jim is very...
It's very old school.

35:57.691 --> 35:58.868
You got a better idea?

35:58.892 --> 36:00.136
Matter of fact, I do.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.539
Ziva, I'm gonna put you on hold
for one second.

36:02.563 --> 36:03.962
Uh, stay on the line, though.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.645
I built an application
for my phone.

36:08.669 --> 36:10.509
Why is that important
to what we're doing here?

36:12.039 --> 36:14.150
With a vehicle's VIN number,

36:14.174 --> 36:17.186
you can access all the
vehicle's pertinent information,

36:17.210 --> 36:20.723
including key and remote code.

36:20.747 --> 36:23.726
I hack into a database,

36:23.750 --> 36:26.629
download all the codes,
and there it is.

36:26.653 --> 36:29.699
Wow. Well, I'm glad
that MIT education paid off

36:29.723 --> 36:31.200
for something, McGee.

36:31.224 --> 36:33.269
It is pretty super, isn't it?

36:33.293 --> 36:34.370
I don't believe you.

36:34.394 --> 36:36.673
Yeah, I'm not gonna unlock
the door for you, Tony.

36:36.697 --> 36:39.509
Well, I don't think
you could unlock the door.

36:39.533 --> 36:41.578
'Cause if you could, you'd
prove it to me by doing it.

36:41.602 --> 36:42.712
- Uh, no, it does.
- No, I...

36:42.736 --> 36:43.846
Hey.

36:43.870 --> 36:45.739
- M... Mine!
- No, uh, Tony.

36:48.342 --> 36:49.502
You should patent that.

36:53.213 --> 36:54.958
Ziva, where is he now?

36:54.982 --> 36:56.259
He has not moved.

36:56.283 --> 36:58.227
What are they up to?

36:58.251 --> 37:00.563
How do I get into his files?

37:00.587 --> 37:02.298
Tony, you can't.

37:02.322 --> 37:03.267
You know what? You're right.

37:03.291 --> 37:05.034
You could get in here
in ten seconds.

37:05.058 --> 37:06.502
And then we'd be out of here.

37:06.526 --> 37:08.289
Come on. I'll hold the phone.

37:11.298 --> 37:12.458
All right.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.881
All right, files are
listed by clients' names.

37:18.905 --> 37:21.100
Major Gordon Holcomb.

37:28.148 --> 37:29.726
All right. Done. Give me this.

37:29.750 --> 37:30.893
I want no more part of this.

37:30.917 --> 37:32.145
Thank you very much.

37:51.038 --> 37:54.517
Ah, it's exactly
what you asked for.

37:54.541 --> 37:58.354
They called me last night
to tell me it was here.

37:58.378 --> 38:01.745
You should be very pleased.

38:02.883 --> 38:04.961
I missed you at the opera
last night, Mother.

38:04.985 --> 38:08.255
Madame Butterfly.
All those melodies.

38:09.589 --> 38:12.459
One after the other.
It never ceases to amaze me.

38:17.130 --> 38:19.121
Mortimer.

38:26.306 --> 38:28.297
When did she die?

38:31.511 --> 38:35.024
Ah, Ducky, I'm so sorry.

38:35.048 --> 38:37.539
I'm so sorry.

38:42.355 --> 38:43.866
Oh, this is interesting.

38:43.890 --> 38:46.035
It's an e-mail from
a private lab in Philadelphia.

38:46.059 --> 38:46.970
Listen to this.

38:46.994 --> 38:48.037
"As you suspected,

38:48.061 --> 38:50.239
"we have matched the left thumb
and index finger

38:50.263 --> 38:51.841
"on the water bottle you sent us

38:51.865 --> 38:53.509
"to First Lieutenant

38:53.533 --> 38:55.511
John Mayne, USMC."

38:55.535 --> 38:57.833
So, the P.I. knew
Wells was Mayne.

39:00.173 --> 39:01.317
Ziva, uh...

39:01.341 --> 39:03.019
check with the ATF database.

39:03.043 --> 39:05.088
See if Iger has a registered.45.

39:05.112 --> 39:06.656
Are you going to tell me
what's going on, McGee,

39:06.680 --> 39:07.990
or is this, like, a guy thing?

39:08.014 --> 39:09.158
Yeah. Later, later.

39:09.182 --> 39:11.027
Hey. Why would Iger

39:11.051 --> 39:12.261
withhold that information
from his client?

39:12.285 --> 39:15.398
Because if he tells his
client, he only gets the fee,

39:15.422 --> 39:16.699
which is a couple hundred bucks.

39:16.723 --> 39:18.735
But if he withholds
the information,

39:18.759 --> 39:20.719
uses it to blackmail Mayne,
who is worth millions?

39:31.338 --> 39:32.315
- McGee?
- Yeah?

39:32.339 --> 39:35.551
Iger owns a Smith & Wesson.45.

39:35.575 --> 39:37.805
Great. Okay. Uh, thanks,
Ziva. Don't go away.

39:39.446 --> 39:40.690
You know, it's too bad
we won't be able

39:40.714 --> 39:41.858
to use any of this information,

39:41.882 --> 39:43.259
'cause you broke into the car,

39:43.283 --> 39:46.286
and then obtained it illegally
from his computer. Criminal.

39:55.562 --> 39:57.673
McGee, Iger's coming your way.

39:57.697 --> 39:58.891
You better get out of there.

40:01.067 --> 40:02.478
Well, what can I tell you?

40:02.502 --> 40:05.114
I charge $100 an hour,
plus expenses.

40:05.138 --> 40:06.249
Yeah.

40:06.273 --> 40:08.818
You got my number, pal.

40:08.842 --> 40:11.154
Hey.

40:11.178 --> 40:13.055
NCIS, right?

40:13.079 --> 40:14.056
Yep.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.424
You guys making any headway?

40:15.448 --> 40:17.293
Well, as a matter of fact,

40:17.317 --> 40:18.961
we wanted to ask you
a few questions.

40:18.985 --> 40:20.696
Sure. Whatever I can do.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.032
Well, according to,
uh, ATF records,

40:23.056 --> 40:25.301
you have a permit to carry a.45.

40:25.325 --> 40:26.602
Can we see your weapon?

40:26.626 --> 40:30.039
I haven't carried it in years.

40:30.063 --> 40:32.809
I, uh, I sold it at a gun show.

40:32.833 --> 40:34.610
Oh, well. That's good.

40:34.634 --> 40:36.102
How about you
put the bag down...

40:41.842 --> 40:43.653
Where do you think you're going?

40:43.677 --> 40:44.987
All right, all right.

40:45.011 --> 40:47.924
Come on. You don't
have to do this.

40:47.948 --> 40:49.973
All right.

40:51.585 --> 40:54.664
So, did you try
to shake Wells down?

40:54.688 --> 40:56.833
Meet in the park went bad,
didn't it?

40:56.857 --> 40:58.601
It was self-defense.

40:58.625 --> 41:01.070
He had a gun. He shot first.

41:01.094 --> 41:03.426
The guy stole millions.
I only asked for 100 grand.

41:14.674 --> 41:16.904
When were you going
to tell me, Duck?

41:19.579 --> 41:21.570
Soon.

41:23.316 --> 41:25.027
I thought
about having a service,

41:25.051 --> 41:27.420
but all of Mother's friends
predeceased her.

41:28.588 --> 41:31.100
I was all she had.

41:31.124 --> 41:34.871
Okay. So, why keep it
to yourself?

41:34.895 --> 41:37.607
I didn't want to impose.

41:37.631 --> 41:40.376
I'm surrounded by death, Jethro.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.011
I wanted to deal

41:42.035 --> 41:46.369
with the personal loss
by myself.

41:49.009 --> 41:51.102
Did you know
that she was almost 100?

41:52.145 --> 41:54.156
And she had an active,
full life,

41:54.180 --> 41:56.325
but this last year,

41:56.349 --> 41:57.526
she has not been herself.

41:57.550 --> 41:59.262
It was her time.

41:59.286 --> 42:02.380
The natural progression of age.

42:03.857 --> 42:06.202
You going to stay in the house?

42:06.226 --> 42:07.703
The sale is pending.

42:07.727 --> 42:09.038
We should close next week.

42:09.062 --> 42:11.240
Ooh, those wretched little dogs?

42:11.264 --> 42:14.859
I found a good home for them
with a corgi lover in Virginia.

42:16.369 --> 42:17.513
What are you going to do?

42:17.537 --> 42:21.183
I've put down an offer
on a brownstone in Georgetown.

42:21.207 --> 42:23.586
It's on the Historic Registry.

42:23.610 --> 42:26.589
I've been working with a
charming real estate agent.

42:26.613 --> 42:28.591
Her name is Sophie.

42:28.615 --> 42:30.826
She's...

42:30.850 --> 42:33.148
quite a bit younger than myself.

42:35.922 --> 42:37.700
So, I take it.

42:37.724 --> 42:41.037
Sophie's the one
that doesn't like the bow ties?

42:41.061 --> 42:42.395
Well...
