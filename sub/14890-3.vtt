Try.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.862
Try this. I made it
in my cooking class.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.531
Everybody loved it.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.099
‐Egg rolls?
‐Yeah.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.201
Well, they look safe enough.

Balki, these are the best
egg rolls I’ve ever had!

‐Oh, go on with you...
‐No, I mean it!

01:55.949 --> 01:58.484
‐No.
‐These are delicious!

01:58.519 --> 02:01.655
Well, as my cooking teacher,
Mr. De Rigeur said

02:01.688 --> 02:05.225
"Balki, cuisine is an art.

02:05.258 --> 02:08.228
That’s why we call it
cuisine‐art."

I don’t get it.

I just heard you tell her
it was alright.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.429
If you didn’t want her to go,
why you don’t just say no?

04:56.462 --> 04:58.632
Balki, the woman I love
tells me she wants to go out

04:58.665 --> 05:00.567
with another man
and you expect me to say no?

05:03.469 --> 05:04.838
What? Do you think I’m stupid?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.374
Is this a trick question?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.945
No. No, it is very simple.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.615
Jennifer is a woman
of the nineties.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.792
A woman of the nineties.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.127
And if you read any of those
women’s magazines

05:27.160 --> 05:30.396
you know that what she wants
is a man of the nineties.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.698
Well, cousin, in sixty years

05:31.732 --> 05:33.366
you’ll be a man in your nineties

05:33.399 --> 05:34.835
and all your problems
will be solved.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.370
No, no, not a man
in his nineties.

05:37.403 --> 05:38.905
A man of the nineties.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.643
And a man of the nineties
isn’t possessive or jealous.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.511
And if I had told Jennifer
I didn’t want her to go

05:44.545 --> 05:45.579
on this date,
she would have thought

05:45.612 --> 05:46.980
I was possessive and jealous.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.014
And then,
she would have dumped me

05:48.048 --> 05:50.884
gone out with another man
and I’d be miserable.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.987
But, but...she is going out
with another man

05:54.020 --> 05:55.355
and you are miserable.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.692

if he would mind

06:28.755 --> 06:30.423
if I had dinner
with another man.

the nerve to say to me?

where our relationship is going.

you should just ask him.

I’ll tell Larry
I want to date other people.

and then I’ll know really feels.

always give me such good advice.

complete freedom

she’ll be mine forever.

on the subject?

my Silly Putty back in my egg

08:36.282 --> 08:37.884
when I had a realization.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.687
Now, I know that some things
are very personal

08:40.721 --> 08:43.089
and there are times when
a person shouldn’t interfere.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.991
In fact, in Mypos
we have a saying...

09:03.009 --> 09:05.211

09:05.245 --> 09:06.346
Exactly.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.949
Literally translated, it means

09:08.982 --> 09:12.018
"When a man is rinsing out
his underwear...

09:12.052 --> 09:13.554
...don’t drop by."

09:16.890 --> 09:18.592
(Larry)
’Is there a point to this?’

09:18.625 --> 09:21.928
Cousin, you should tell Jennifer
how you really feel.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.297
Balki, Jennifer is a woman
of the nineties.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.599
I am a man of the nineties.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.967
Are you a man of the nineties?

‐Ah! Hah!
‐Okay?

‐Are you? Are you?

Are you? Are you a man
of the nineties?

09:37.711 --> 09:38.912
No. No, I’m not.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.183
Then I suggest you
go to your room

09:43.216 --> 09:45.986
and we’ll talk about this
when you are.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.590
That seems fair.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.100
Now...where were we?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.068
We’ve been seeing
each other for three years.

10:02.102 --> 10:02.969
Yes.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.905
And I was wondering
how you might feel

10:04.938 --> 10:06.807
about us dating other people?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.075
Other people?

10:10.010 --> 10:13.313
W‐well, uh...I guess

10:13.346 --> 10:17.150
that would be...alright,
I guess.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.854
It would?

10:20.887 --> 10:23.256
Uh, maybe I’m not making
myself clear.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.159
You see, I don’t just mean
one date with one person.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.862
It could be several dates
with one person

10:28.895 --> 10:30.764
or one date with several people

10:30.797 --> 10:32.198
or several dates
with several people.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.668
There are several possibilities.
What do you think?

10:34.701 --> 10:37.037
W‐well, um...

10:37.070 --> 10:39.640
I‐If you think
that’s, uh, a good idea...

10:40.774 --> 10:42.275
...so do I.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.811
So, you’re saying that
it wouldn’t bother you

10:44.845 --> 10:46.847

10:46.880 --> 10:48.882
Bother? Oh, no, no.

It wouldn’t bother me,
if it wouldn’t bother you.

‐You’re sure?
‐Positive.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.825

You’d think by now
she’d be sick of gettin’

12:06.827 --> 12:08.228
in and out of that Porsche.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.800
Cousin, uh...w‐what do you say

12:13.834 --> 12:16.136
we go out and get a couple
of sky high sundaes?

12:16.169 --> 12:19.172
No, I wanna be here
when they get back.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.207
Cousin, enough. Is too much.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.409
You’ve got to pull
yourself together.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.978
Now, come on,
move it along, buddy.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.112
Move it along.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.181
Just keep movin’.

12:28.214 --> 12:32.218
Cousin, you haven’t left
the apartment in two weeks.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.855
I have no reason to leave.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.990
Life outside this apartment
is meaningless.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.794
Life inside
the apartment is meaningless.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.531
But my pajamas are here.

12:44.565 --> 12:47.433
Okay, buddy, park it
on the couch. On the couch.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.102
On the couch.
Move it, please.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.807
Listen to me.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.077
My mama done told me...

13:00.146 --> 13:03.316
...there are two times in life
when you’ve got to tell people

13:03.349 --> 13:05.185
what your true feelings are.

13:05.218 --> 13:09.556
One is when someone is sticking
a sharp thing in your ear.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.261
Then you say...

13:15.295 --> 13:19.399
"Please, take that sharp thing
out of my ear."

13:21.201 --> 13:23.537
The other is when you
love someone.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.139
And then you say, "I love you!"

13:26.172 --> 13:28.509
It’s important
not to get the two mixed up.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.579
But Balki,
if I tell Jennifer I love her

13:32.613 --> 13:34.915
she’ll just reject me again .

13:34.948 --> 13:37.283
And I‐I couldn’t stand
that much pain.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.185
Oh, cousin.

13:39.219 --> 13:42.488
I‐I‐I’ve gotta stop thinking
about her or I’m gonna go crazy.

13:42.523 --> 13:44.357
I’ve gotta try to forget her.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.559
So if you’re my friend

13:45.592 --> 13:49.229
you won’t do or say anything
that reminds me of that...

13:49.262 --> 13:51.231
...nameless blonde woman.

13:53.634 --> 13:57.170
‐Now who are we talking about?
‐Jennifer.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.238
‐Jennifer?
‐No!

13:58.271 --> 14:00.273
‐Aah!
‐Don’t say her name!

14:00.306 --> 14:03.510
Just promise me, you‐you won’t
mention her name again!

14:03.544 --> 14:06.212
Promise you’ll never scare me
like that again!

14:06.246 --> 14:08.214
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.516
‐I promise.
‐I promise.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.417
Thank you.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.555
I’ll be in my room...

14:14.588 --> 14:16.557
...destroying anything
that reminds me

14:16.590 --> 14:19.059
of that nameless blonde woman.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.295
[sighs]

14:22.328 --> 14:25.231
I’ll start by destroying
all her love letters.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.434
Oh, God!

14:29.936 --> 14:32.205
She never wrote me
any love letters!

14:37.443 --> 14:38.945
[knock on door]

14:43.016 --> 14:44.050
Hi, Mary Anne.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.087
‐Balki, I need to talk to you.
‐Oh.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.424
Uh, Bill told me he’s taking
Jennifer to Chez Fino tonight.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.393
Oh, I love that restaurant!

14:53.426 --> 14:55.529
They have those little snails
in puff pastry

14:55.562 --> 14:57.664
and if you poke them out,
they go walking, walking...

14:57.698 --> 14:59.232
Balki.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.668
Bill is going to ask
Jennifer to marry him.

15:01.702 --> 15:03.336
[speaking in foreign language]

15:03.369 --> 15:05.271
Oh! Pardon my Myposian.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.676
I can’t let this happen.
I‐I...

15:09.710 --> 15:12.345
I have to get cousin Larry
to that restaurant!

15:12.378 --> 15:14.080
And then what will you do?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.582
[sighs]

15:15.616 --> 15:17.350
I don’t know.

15:17.383 --> 15:22.656
Maybe take in a movie?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.324
[instrumental music]

15:30.597 --> 15:33.534
[piano music]

15:40.240 --> 15:41.642
[speaking in foreign language]

15:41.675 --> 15:42.976
Yes, sir.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.078
Well, this is nice.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.146
I’m glad you talked me
into this.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.749
‐I feel better already.
‐Oh, cousin, you’re a...

15:48.782 --> 15:51.251
You’re, you’re a new‐new man.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.154
And maybe tomorrow, you
can tie your own shoes.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.722
[laughs]
Oh!

15:55.756 --> 15:58.258
I have a table waiting for you
right over here.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.062
Oh, well, why go that way when
we can take the scenic routes?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.064
‐Cousin, look at this view!
‐Oh.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.166
‐Well, this is magnificent.
‐Would you look at that view?

16:06.199 --> 16:07.267
Fabulous, isn’t it?

16:07.300 --> 16:10.036
And, and this wallpaper!
Is that flocked?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.538
Lovely! And is...

16:11.572 --> 16:13.206
Is that a real oil painting?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.677
Yeah, that’s, that’s real oil.

16:16.710 --> 16:19.445
There’s a raw umber
in the foreground there.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.215
It’s fantastic. And look at
this, cousin! The desserts!

16:22.248 --> 16:26.620
Look, they have your favorite,
"Lemon meringue pie!"

16:26.653 --> 16:29.189
‐Mmm. Too much sugar for me.
‐Ha, ha, ha.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.691
Gentlemen, your table.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.258
‐Oh, cousin...
‐Yeah.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.293
Cousin, uh, would you

16:33.326 --> 16:34.494
w‐would you, would you mind
sitting over here?

16:34.528 --> 16:37.330
I‐I can’t be looking at those
desserts, you know. I...

16:38.632 --> 16:40.200
[sighs]

16:40.233 --> 16:41.568
Well, here...

16:41.602 --> 16:43.369
[chuckling]

16:43.403 --> 16:45.271
[sighs]
This is nice...

16:46.339 --> 16:48.108
Absolutely nothing here
reminds me

16:48.141 --> 16:50.476
of that nameless blonde woman.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.081
Except possibly for Jennifer
sitting over there

16:55.115 --> 16:56.116
with her boyfriend.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.630
[clattering]

17:16.603 --> 17:18.238
Y‐you’re, uh...
Ha, ha.

17:18.271 --> 17:21.406
Y‐you’re not going to get
annoyed with me, are you?

17:21.441 --> 17:23.577
‐I’m not gonna get annoyed.
‐Oh, that’s good.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.345
‐I’m gonna kill you.
‐Oh, that’s bad.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.182
‐I’m leaving.
‐No, cousin, you can’t do that.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.517
Well, you can’t stop me!

17:31.384 --> 17:32.452
[groans]

17:42.228 --> 17:43.630
Cousin, you have to tell
that nameless

17:43.664 --> 17:44.865
blonde woman how
you feel about her.

17:44.898 --> 17:48.401
If you don’t, you will regret it
for the rest of your life!

17:49.469 --> 17:51.204
‐Balki, let me go.
‐No!

17:51.237 --> 17:52.673
Oh, look,
is that Wayne Newton?

17:52.706 --> 17:53.774
Wayne!

17:57.143 --> 17:59.079
[thudding]

18:07.353 --> 18:10.290
[piano music]

18:11.658 --> 18:13.193
Who had the Cousin Larry?

18:16.697 --> 18:19.199
‐Do you know these people?
‐I’m afraid so.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.301
What are you doing here?

18:22.603 --> 18:24.538
Cousin Larry has something
he wants to tell you.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.140
Uh, we’re in the middle
of a very private moment.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.274
Eat your broccoli!

18:28.308 --> 18:29.375
Cousin, go ahead.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.278
Well...

18:32.312 --> 18:35.448
Uh...uh...uh...

18:35.481 --> 18:37.417
Jennifer, what he wants
to tell you is...

18:37.450 --> 18:38.318
‐J‐Jennifer, let me just say...
‐Balki. Balki.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.753
‐Balki, Balki...
‐L‐let me just say it!

18:39.786 --> 18:41.755
[babbling]

18:41.788 --> 18:43.223
Uh, yes.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.859
If Larry has something
to say, let him say it.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.829
Well...

18:48.862 --> 18:51.832
Uh...uh...uh...

18:51.865 --> 18:52.899
Jennifer...

18:53.900 --> 18:56.870
This, this isn’t easy
for me to say but...

18:59.873 --> 19:02.342
Please take that sharp thing
out of my ear.

19:11.752 --> 19:12.953
Uh...

19:12.986 --> 19:16.356
Well, t‐there’s something
I‐I’ve been meaning to tell you.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.559
And I‐I wanted to tell you
t‐the first time I saw you

19:18.592 --> 19:19.860
in the health club.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.427
And then we s‐started dating

19:21.461 --> 19:23.429
a‐a‐and I wanted
to tell you again.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.899
And, and then a couple of weeks
ago, when you came down

19:25.932 --> 19:28.334
I‐I really wanted to tell you.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.970
But I didn’t.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.573
So, I’m telling you now.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.508
[exhales]

19:36.643 --> 19:37.711
What are you telling me?

19:38.579 --> 19:41.782
Jennifer...I love you.

19:45.485 --> 19:49.556
‐You do?
‐Yes, I love you.

19:49.590 --> 19:52.793
A‐a‐and I‐I don’t want you
goin’ out with other guys.

19:54.460 --> 19:58.231
Well, that’s nice. But I just
asked Jennifer to marry me.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.432
Boy, he’s fast.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.869
Jennifer, if you say yes to me

20:02.903 --> 20:04.237
’you’ll never
want for anything.’

20:04.270 --> 20:07.273
You’ll have a magnificent home,
all the money you’ll ever need

20:07.307 --> 20:09.943
and...beautiful children.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.917
Here’s the ring, sweetheart.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.752
It’s yours, if you’ll say yes.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.558
‐Oh, my Lord!
‐Oh, my Lord!

20:26.860 --> 20:28.829
Okay, cousin, you’re up.

20:28.862 --> 20:30.130
Take your best shot.

20:30.163 --> 20:33.600
It’s the bottom of the ninth,
two outs, the bases are loaded

20:33.634 --> 20:34.768
you’ve got two strikes
against you.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.971
Cousin, it’s time to kick it
through the uprights!

20:40.607 --> 20:42.576
Go, baby, go,
baby, go, baby, go!

20:45.979 --> 20:48.281
[piano music]

20:48.314 --> 20:52.953
Jennifer, I can’t promise you
a magnificent home.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.421
Or all the money
you’ll ever need.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.957
And there’s a good chance

20:56.990 --> 20:58.692
our children will be short.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.364
But I want you to know...

21:04.397 --> 21:06.567
...nobody’s gonna love you
as much as I do.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.334
So I‐I think it would be...

21:08.368 --> 21:11.471
...just...really...good...

21:12.706 --> 21:14.641
...if you married me.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.745
Yes, Larry. I’ll marry you.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.314
You will?

21:22.883 --> 21:24.518
Mm‐hmm. Yes.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.553
Larry, I love you.

21:26.587 --> 21:29.322
Oh. Oh. Oh.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.892
Oh, oh, oh. Oh.

[instrumental music]

21:42.503 --> 21:45.371
Look, I know it was
a horrible night for him.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.073
But Bill asked Jennifer
out to dinner

21:47.107 --> 21:48.642
he should have paid the check!

21:50.410 --> 21:52.646
Cousin, let it go.
You got the girl!

21:54.715 --> 21:56.349
You’re right.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.483
[instrumental music]

21:57.518 --> 21:58.585
Balki...

22:00.053 --> 22:03.557
...this is the most wonderful
night of my life.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.692
Jennifer loves me
as much as I love her

22:05.726 --> 22:08.061
and I never would have found
that out if it weren’t for you.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.763
‐Oh.
‐Thank you.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.964
Cousin, you’re welcome.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.100
I‐I‐I could not
be happier for you.

22:14.134 --> 22:16.136
You are going to
be married to Jennifer

22:16.169 --> 22:18.371
for the rest of your life.

22:18.404 --> 22:21.141
Yeah, it’s gonna be wonderful.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.645
Well, it certainly is, because
cousin, just think of it.

22:24.678 --> 22:28.048
Every hour of every day

22:28.081 --> 22:30.917
for the rest of your life...

22:30.951 --> 22:33.654
...you will have
the joy of knowing

22:33.687 --> 22:35.622
you have someone
to take care of.

22:36.990 --> 22:39.960
Every, every, every minute

22:39.993 --> 22:43.063
of every hour
of every day

22:43.096 --> 22:45.465
for the rest of your life

22:45.498 --> 22:48.502
you’ll have someone
who depends on you.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.104
Someone who needs you.

22:51.137 --> 22:54.808
Someone who’s very happiness
rests in your hands.
