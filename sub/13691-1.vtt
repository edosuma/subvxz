-Perfectly.

00:08.434 --> 00:10.853
You've actually got a wee spot
on the end of your nose.

00:10.937 --> 00:12.647
Thank you very much. Charming.

00:12.730 --> 00:15.441
-What about the tilt?
Is that working?
-Hold on.

00:15.524 --> 00:19.195
Yep. Good.
Microphone testing, testing,
one, two, two.

00:19.278 --> 00:22.949
-Hearing you, loud and clear.
-Good. You'd better
check the other cameras.

00:24.033 --> 00:26.035
-Golly, are you there?
-Yes.

00:26.118 --> 00:27.995
Is Lexie there?

00:28.079 --> 00:30.915
This better not take all day.
I've got dinner for
12 to make. I'm a cook.

-Duncan?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.588
-Duncan?
-Duncan?

00:37.672 --> 00:40.716
Molly,
I know I can rely on you.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.593
Oh, hello dear.

00:42.677 --> 00:46.472
I'm in go-mode in the library.
Beep.

00:46.556 --> 00:48.307
Is Father there?

00:48.391 --> 00:50.935
No, he'll be here in a minute.
Don't worry,
he'll be here in a minute.

00:51.018 --> 00:54.146
Good. What about Duncan?
Has anyone seen him?

00:54.230 --> 00:56.524
-He promised that he...
Duncan!
-Duncan!

00:56.607 --> 00:59.026
LEXIE: Duncan!
Tell him we're going
to be online in a minute.

00:59.110 --> 01:00.861
Duncan!

01:00.945 --> 01:02.947

KATRINA: Hang on,
I think I've got him.

01:10.245 --> 01:12.540
-Ready?
-Right.

01:12.623 --> 01:14.750
-Good luck, Archie.
-Thank you.

01:14.834 --> 01:16.961
-MOLLY: Look, look, come on.
-Nine...

01:17.044 --> 01:19.714
-Golly, the wheelbarrow!
-Yes, right, okay.

now going online to the world.

I'm the laird here.

-For 400 years and more...
-Molly!

01:47.782 --> 01:49.702
...my family have lived in
this fantastic place,

01:49.785 --> 01:51.537

historic destiny.

What am I supposed to do?
It's embarrassing!

and look aristocratic.

Now,
a new day dawns at Glenbogle.

After centuries as a tranquil
retreat for one family,

02:35.539 --> 02:40.336
we're throwing it open
so that others
can...enjoy it too.

-Well, how was it?
-Archie, it was great!

03:04.860 --> 03:07.655
-You should be on television.
-Ah,
thank you very much indeed.

03:07.738 --> 03:09.198
Justine, sweetheart,
you missed it.

03:09.282 --> 03:12.535
Sorry, I was...just
running our business.

03:12.618 --> 03:16.163
But I see you're in
good hands. Literally.

03:18.541 --> 03:20.126
Bless you.

04:37.328 --> 04:40.373
-These came for you.
-Thanks.

04:43.626 --> 04:45.002
I'm sorry.

04:45.086 --> 04:47.505
Well, it's not really me
you should apologise to.

04:47.588 --> 04:51.008
I'd never have got this whole
thing up and running
without Katrina.

04:51.092 --> 04:53.636
IT training, business
degree and golden curls.

04:53.719 --> 04:55.721
Look, just because we were
at school together

04:55.805 --> 04:57.681
and we happen to have
quite a lot in common...

04:57.765 --> 04:59.725
And she's always here
and you like
each other so much.

04:59.809 --> 05:02.812
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
she's a threat to you,
sweetheart.

05:02.894 --> 05:06.607
-Doesn't it?
-Can't you just try
to get on with her?

05:06.691 --> 05:08.818
She could be
a real help to us.

05:10.361 --> 05:12.822
Okay. For you.

05:17.159 --> 05:20.788
ARCHIE: Oh, look,
someone's dropped in for tea.

05:20.871 --> 05:26.043
That's not someone.
That's Mr Brown.
International man of mystery.

05:39.682 --> 05:44.812
Welcome to Glenbogle,
Mr Brown. I do hope you have
a successful course.

05:44.896 --> 05:47.565
-What could possibly go wrong?
-HECTOR: Good day to you.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.942
I knew our home was being
invaded by aliens,

05:50.026 --> 05:51.861
but isn't this just a touch
over the top?

05:51.944 --> 05:53.863
Watch out!

05:55.823 --> 05:57.533
What's that?

05:57.617 --> 06:00.202
-Gear.
-Gear?

06:00.286 --> 06:04.248
Um, this is Hector MacDonald,
my partner's father.

06:04.332 --> 06:08.127
And this is Mr Brown, who
is organising the management
training weekend.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.171
How
monumentally uninteresting.

06:10.254 --> 06:13.341
Tell me,
are you as dull as your name
and occupation suggest?

06:13.424 --> 06:15.259
-Hector?
-Huh?

06:15.343 --> 06:18.512
We're having your
people picked up
as per your instructions.

06:18.596 --> 06:22.350
-This equipment needs to
be stowed in my office.
-Office?

06:26.562 --> 06:28.648
FLEMING: You'll love working
at the old bank, Mary.

06:28.731 --> 06:30.733
They really look after
their employees.

06:30.816 --> 06:34.320
-Really?
-Yes, treat you with
courtesy and consideration.

06:34.403 --> 06:37.573
Not like those
hard-nosed so-and-so's
you used to be with.

06:37.657 --> 06:40.910
I'm a bit frightened, though.
A team building
exercise in my first week?

06:40.993 --> 06:45.373
Oh, there's nothing to it.
A few days' gentle R
&amp; R, away from base.

06:45.456 --> 06:50.127
And you'll love it here.
There it is, children.

06:50.211 --> 06:55.174
Prepare to enter
the kingdom of heaven.
A haven of peace and harmony.

06:56.801 --> 06:59.136
Looks a total
dump if you ask me.

07:18.281 --> 07:22.994
MAN:
I turned down a corporate box
at the Open for this?

07:23.077 --> 07:27.582
Oh! Two miles down
the track in an army truck
and a dose of mad cow disease.

07:27.665 --> 07:30.585
BROWN: Right.

07:30.668 --> 07:32.837
MARY: This is beautiful!

07:33.963 --> 07:36.215
You see,
the thing is, Katrina,

07:36.299 --> 07:40.136
Archie and I have been
together for a long time, and
that's not going to change,

07:40.219 --> 07:42.930
especially now
that I've committed
myself to Glenbogle.

07:43.014 --> 07:47.184
So, it's a waste of your time,
energy and,
frankly, your dignity,

07:47.268 --> 07:49.020
trying to prise him away.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.273
I am doing no such thing.

07:52.356 --> 07:55.651
Come off it. You're
never away from the place.

07:55.735 --> 08:00.531
Glenbogle is my home
and has been for far
longer than it's been yours.

08:00.615 --> 08:04.243
Correction. Your home is
20-minutes cycle
ride down the glen.

08:04.326 --> 08:07.622
-Maybe you should stay there.
-Aye, maybe I will.

08:07.705 --> 08:10.917
This
conversation is demeaning,
especially for you, Justine.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.877
As long as you
get the message.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.672
Perhaps I should express it in
the language of
the Highland laird.

08:16.756 --> 08:19.717
Private property. Keep off.

08:33.898 --> 08:36.107
Are you piping this or not?

08:36.192 --> 08:39.236
Justine said not
to bother with that
sturmarche anymore.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.905
Oh, she did, did she?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.698
Well, why don't we all
just stop wearing kilts,

08:43.783 --> 08:46.535
eating deep fried Mars bars,
and hating the English?

08:46.619 --> 08:51.749
-And all our other
ancient Scottish traditions?
-GOLLY: Who rattled your cage?

08:51.832 --> 08:54.918
Anyways, since when have you
been so in love with
the scuttle of the pipes?

08:55.002 --> 08:59.089
Maybe when Glenbogle's
answer to Mrs Thatcher
started banning them.

08:59.173 --> 09:03.678
-GOLLY: It's okay.
-Yeah, fair play. She's okay.

09:05.930 --> 09:08.558
Well...ish.

09:08.641 --> 09:12.645
Answer me this then, is it
as much fun as it used to be
when it was just Archie?

09:12.728 --> 09:16.357
Lexie,
the bankers have arrived
so we'll eat at seven.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.859
Promptly this time,
if you don't mind.

-Cow.

Well, maybe this
time you can manage
not to overcook it.

09:30.329 --> 09:35.042
Last time we had beef,
it was stringy,
tough and rather tasteless.

09:35.126 --> 09:38.629
Maybe it's not the only
thing round here then, eh?

09:46.137 --> 09:49.223
Come on! In my room,
there's a trouser press,

09:49.307 --> 09:52.727
a coffee percolator,
sundry other electricals,

09:52.810 --> 09:56.397
and then, and I don't know
who's train of
thought we're on here,

09:56.480 --> 09:59.233
I come across
this little beauty.

09:59.317 --> 10:02.737
I mean, mints? On the pillows?

10:02.820 --> 10:06.532
This is not "Up and
at 'em" team building,

a blind man in paradise.
It's wonderful here.

-Lexie, aren't you
going to let him have it?
-Defend this place?

10:17.710 --> 10:19.629
Can't be bothered, Flem.

10:19.712 --> 10:24.467
I just can't believe you think
Lascelles should keep
bailing this place out!

10:24.550 --> 10:26.677

of the bank's money!

for a waiter!

10:51.619 --> 10:53.579
A little misunderstanding,
that's all.

10:53.663 --> 10:56.040
I mean, this just isn't
our home anymore,
is it, Molly?

10:56.123 --> 10:59.460
Be with you in a sec.
The Nikkei is just
opening up for trading.

10:59.543 --> 11:01.837
Hector, why can't you
just go with the flow a bit?

11:01.921 --> 11:04.507
Don't be absurd!
For my entire life,
the flow has gone with me!

11:04.590 --> 11:07.009
Well, it can't do you any good
whinging all the time.

11:07.093 --> 11:08.970
"Shut up",
is that what you mean?

11:09.053 --> 11:10.888
I think I managed to
calm everyone down a bit.

11:10.972 --> 11:13.015
-Now look here, my girl...
-Oh.

11:13.099 --> 11:16.102

have tried to defeat

11:16.185 --> 11:18.521
from Butcher
Cumberland to Adolf Hitler,
and failed!

11:18.604 --> 11:20.439
Hector,
please, you're overreacting.

11:20.523 --> 11:23.734
I've been slapping down uppity
females for 40 years,
not gonna stop now.

11:23.818 --> 11:26.195
Oh, Hector, you
couldn't slap anyone down.

11:26.279 --> 11:28.864
Even if you were holding
a large wet
haddock in each hand.

11:28.948 --> 11:31.909
Yeah! Haddock?

It's Justine.

-She's...
-Justine is
working her socks off.

12:05.026 --> 12:07.069
I know.

12:07.153 --> 12:09.530
But she's paranoid
about Archie and me.

12:09.614 --> 12:11.407
I wonder how
she got that idea?

12:14.035 --> 12:15.286
Look...

12:16.579 --> 12:18.873
Katrina, could you
take some advice, lass?

12:18.956 --> 12:23.127
Yes. No... Well, maybe.

12:25.171 --> 12:27.548
Okay.

12:27.632 --> 12:30.927
I'd hate you to think that
I was one of those sad fellows

12:31.010 --> 12:35.431
that can only discuss
painful human dilemmas
and sporting matters.

12:36.432 --> 12:39.602
But if I were you...

I would take my line
right out of the water.

there's trouble
brewing up there.

you get the worst of it.

-Writing a list.

Correction.
Writing a list of all the
other lists I've got to write.

13:15.304 --> 13:18.474
Of all
the things we need to do
to put this place on its feet.

13:20.643 --> 13:23.854
Don't worry about
the little scene
I had with Hector.

13:23.938 --> 13:25.356
It was just a
low level skirmish.

13:25.439 --> 13:28.609
I just wish things
weren't so hard for you.

Oh, no! Fleming.

14:50.233 --> 14:52.068
Time for work.

14:53.611 --> 14:54.779
Oh, dear.

15:00.576 --> 15:02.870
Come on! Long way to go yet.

15:12.255 --> 15:14.215
Come on, Mr Fleming.

15:14.298 --> 15:17.760
If it's not hurting,
it's not doing you any good.

15:22.640 --> 15:27.687
No, you don't!
Nice guys finish last!

15:27.770 --> 15:30.231
-Fleming, are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine, really.

15:30.314 --> 15:33.234
Come on, Mr Fleming,
where's your get-up-and-go?

15:33.317 --> 15:35.570
Got up and went, did it?

15:35.653 --> 15:40.491
Now, on this course I
will be awarding marks
for effort and achievement.

15:40.575 --> 15:45.830
And the end result will
be used by your employers
for purposes of their own.

15:45.913 --> 15:49.792
-Who gets promoted, you mean?
-So, that's one
point for Mr Fleming,

15:49.875 --> 15:53.254
three for Ms Denning
and 10 for Mr Rutter.

-Valve?

boat on my billiard table
as well as everything else!

HECTOR: Enough is enough!
JUSTINE:
Hector, please, calm down.

16:37.298 --> 16:42.386
That is my office in there.
I do all my research in there.

16:44.013 --> 16:46.224
-It just won't do!
-What's the matter?

16:46.307 --> 16:50.561
There is now nowhere in this
house where a chap can find
an iota of peace and quiet!

16:50.645 --> 16:52.772
Not surprising
with you bellowing
the place down, is it?

16:52.855 --> 16:56.984
Hector, I'm sorry but what you
have to understand is that
we're running a business here.

16:57.068 --> 16:59.570
-Sorry.
-Right.
That's it. I've had enough.

16:59.654 --> 17:02.323
-I rather think I have, too.
-I'm sorry to
say this, Justine,

17:02.406 --> 17:04.407
but there just
isn't room in this house
for the two of us.

17:04.492 --> 17:06.827
It's not me that's
the problem.
I am trying very hard,

17:06.911 --> 17:09.497
but you're just impossible!

17:09.579 --> 17:13.000

toothbrush and nightie,

the retirement home, please.
-It's so unnecessary.

-Something for your
lunch and save me a bed.
-Come on, boys.

18:11.601 --> 18:12.852
I might be joining
you very soon.

18:12.935 --> 18:14.770
This is absolutely ridiculous.

It's for the best.

legs just slightly apart

it's like something out of
Hansel and Gretel.

19:04.153 --> 19:07.615
-Father, please.
-Excuse me.

19:09.575 --> 19:10.826
Mother, do you really
have to do this?

19:10.910 --> 19:13.704
I'm sorry,
I agree with your father.

19:13.788 --> 19:15.831
Can I at least give
you a hand settling in?

19:15.915 --> 19:17.541
We can manage, thank you.

19:19.585 --> 19:22.588
What are you going
to do about supper?

19:22.672 --> 19:26.634
We shall be dining here,
quietly and simply.

19:26.717 --> 19:29.720

Do you want a sandwich?

Lexie! Look what's happening.
Fleming's going
to get relegated.

19:59.125 --> 20:01.836
Well, he was no great
shakes at the abseiling.

20:01.919 --> 20:06.340
His raft sunk, and a bee stung
him at the end of his

-Huh?

20:14.223 --> 20:17.768
Look, I'm really
sorry about this morning.
Your dad.

20:17.852 --> 20:21.063
We'll talk about that later.
I've got to do
something about Fleming first.

20:21.147 --> 20:22.982
Archie, you can't interfere.

20:25.318 --> 20:30.072
Justine, look, we are
knee-deep in debt here.

20:30.156 --> 20:32.283
It's only thanks to Fleming
that we're still afloat.
Believe me,

20:32.366 --> 20:35.077
if he loses
his job, we will be finished!

20:35.161 --> 20:38.039
But he's just one person.
It's the bank we've
got to keep in with.

20:38.122 --> 20:40.625
I know what I'm doing.
I'm acting in our
long-term interests.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.628
No, you're not!
You're threatening them.
Just stay out of it.

20:43.711 --> 20:46.047
Oh, sorry!
And here was me
thinking that I was in charge.

20:46.130 --> 20:48.216
If anyone should
stay out of it...

20:48.299 --> 20:51.761
Well, I was going to ask
for your help, but there's
obviously no point.

last chance today to
avoid the wooden spoon.

21:10.947 --> 21:15.243
-Molly, that
cell-like chamber downstairs?
-The drawing room, yes?

21:15.326 --> 21:17.912
-There's a hole in the wall.
-It's called a hatch.

21:17.995 --> 21:20.248
I should be conveying
your supper through it.

still...needs must.

21:25.628 --> 21:28.464
Oh, not much storage space.

21:28.547 --> 21:31.384
Well, we'll have to share.
You take this side
and I'll take that.

21:31.467 --> 21:34.512
-I'll use the wardrobe
in my bedroom, can't I?
-No, you can't!

21:34.595 --> 21:36.222
Why ever not?

21:36.305 --> 21:39.350
Because you haven't got
a bedroom. This is it.
We'll have to share.

21:39.433 --> 21:42.979
-Share a bedroom?
-Be rather cosy, won't it?

21:45.106 --> 21:48.359

the same bedroom?

come with me, now!

22:04.000 --> 22:06.419
Well, I can't.
I've got to finish
this project for tomorrow.

22:06.502 --> 22:10.423
-I need your help.
-Well, I don't think
it's really a good idea.

22:10.506 --> 22:13.384
I've got a crisis with Fleming
and the bankers.
It's a long story,

22:13.467 --> 22:15.177
but I need you, please!

22:17.763 --> 22:22.018
-Archie MacDonald,
you are maddening!
-Yeah, so everyone tells me.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.688

Now, pay close attention.

22:26.939 --> 22:31.861
This is
an exercise in intelligence,

22:31.944 --> 22:34.947
teamwork and
individual initiative.

22:35.031 --> 22:38.659
You will each drive one of
those all-terrain
vehicles back to the house.

22:40.369 --> 22:43.873
The only problem is,
there's no petrol in them.

22:43.956 --> 22:46.292
-So how...
-Where is the petrol?

22:48.878 --> 22:52.506
The petrol is in those
cans in front of you.

22:52.590 --> 22:55.259
So you'd better start
by bringing them up.

22:59.013 --> 23:01.098
There's got to be
some catch here.

needing that, I think.

your greatest
enemy is complacency.

a tad hacked off with this!

Hello, is there anyone there?

-Where's all this
water coming from?
-The lake.

24:04.453 --> 24:06.497
Actually, it's a loch.
We call it a loch, right?

24:06.581 --> 24:10.418
We'll climb out of here.
Fleming, you be the baseman,
Mary, you're next.

I'm a very experienced
climber. I've done a lot.

-Come on, Mary.

will lose your job and,

29:56.097 --> 29:58.849
ARCHIE: Oh, God.
Problem solved.

30:01.269 --> 30:03.229
-Is it, though?
-Huh?

30:05.231 --> 30:09.902
It seems to me that there's
a big problem here
that no one's facing.

30:09.986 --> 30:13.614
We only seem to enjoy
ourselves when we're sneaking
around behind Justine's back.

30:13.698 --> 30:18.035
-Aw, come on.
-And it's making
me very unhappy.

30:20.162 --> 30:23.874
And what about you?
Are you happy?

30:25.793 --> 30:26.961
I don't know.

30:29.171 --> 30:30.256
No.

30:34.427 --> 30:36.012
I want to go home.

30:36.095 --> 30:40.766
All of a sudden
I'm tired, hungry
and very miserable.

30:41.893 --> 30:43.060
I'm sorry.

30:45.646 --> 30:48.524
Why don't I give you
a lift to your car?

30:48.608 --> 30:49.942
No.

30:52.069 --> 30:54.572
You go home to Justine.

31:16.219 --> 31:19.722
Now then... Ah!

31:22.183 --> 31:23.476
Ah.

31:25.186 --> 31:26.479
Come in.

31:30.650 --> 31:34.362
No.
You've left something behind.

31:34.445 --> 31:38.532
Oh! That's the trouble with
packing in a hurry. Very
thoughtful of you, thank you.

31:40.618 --> 31:44.497
Playing with Archie's toy.
You surprise me, Hector.

31:44.580 --> 31:47.416
I'll have you know
I was Signals
Officer in my battalion.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.877
Trouble is
Archie's put the cameras
in all the wrong places.

31:49.961 --> 31:52.380
If I'm going to stay here,
I have to do
something about it.

31:52.463 --> 31:54.590
And how is the new billet?

31:54.674 --> 31:59.512
Marvellous! Should have done
it years ago. Little house,
simple life, marvellous.

31:59.595 --> 32:02.431
-I'd like you to
come home, Hector.
-Pardon?

32:02.515 --> 32:07.395
You being here
makes Archie feel bad
and I miss you.

32:07.478 --> 32:08.688
Me?

32:10.106 --> 32:12.441
You're like an itch.

32:12.525 --> 32:16.737
Extremely irritating but
without it, one is denied the
pleasure of a good scratch.

32:16.821 --> 32:17.989
Oh.

32:20.366 --> 32:23.119
I'm sorry if I've been
a pain in the neck recently.

32:24.954 --> 32:27.498
I'm sorry too, my dear.

32:27.582 --> 32:30.084
You're not really
very happy here, are you?

32:31.168 --> 32:34.213
Damn. Sorry.

32:42.722 --> 32:44.348
(PIANO PLAYING)

32:56.444 --> 32:59.447
-I didn't know you
could play the piano.
-Oh, I can't!

33:03.993 --> 33:07.955
Oh, I love this stuff.
Matches my mood.

33:09.332 --> 33:11.459
Got the blues, have you?

33:11.542 --> 33:15.671
A slight case of
the dark greens maybe.

33:15.755 --> 33:19.175
Things just aren't
the same around here, Flem.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.385
Nor at Lascelles Bank,
I'm afraid.

33:23.512 --> 33:26.432
There's something I've
always wanted to ask you.

33:26.515 --> 33:29.518
How a nice girl
like you ended up
in a place like this?

33:29.602 --> 33:34.148
Me? I came to
Glenbogle to forget.

33:34.941 --> 33:36.359
Forget what?

33:38.361 --> 33:39.904
Can't remember.

33:41.656 --> 33:44.242
What were you
saying about the bank?

33:44.951 --> 33:47.203
I don't know.

33:47.286 --> 33:50.456
It was never that
exciting a job, but now,

33:50.539 --> 33:54.377
ruthless young
tykes like Nigel
trying to put you down,

33:54.460 --> 33:58.214
new management's forcing you
to fight for a job you
don't really want.

33:58.297 --> 34:01.467
-Well, pack it in, then.
-And do what?

34:01.551 --> 34:05.137
I don't know. Play the piano?

34:05.221 --> 34:06.973
Write symphonies.

34:09.016 --> 34:12.143
I'm not sure I've got
the courage for that, Lex.

34:12.228 --> 34:15.273
Besides, old Archie
needs me where I am.

34:15.356 --> 34:16.940
If I lost my job...

34:17.024 --> 34:21.445
Flem, this is your life,
not Archie's.

34:24.864 --> 34:28.119
You've got to
follow your heart.

34:28.202 --> 34:32.623
If you're not happy in life,
what's the point, eh?

35:40.483 --> 35:42.151
This camera's no good
here at all.

35:42.233 --> 35:44.111
I said it'd
be better off in the house.

35:44.195 --> 35:46.197
All right! Give me a hand.

35:48.699 --> 35:50.826
Come on, come on, come on!

36:11.055 --> 36:16.184
-Father, you're back.
What are you doing?
-Nothing. Nothing.

36:19.730 --> 36:24.360
-Archie?
-Are you all right?

36:24.443 --> 36:29.448
Just listen, I came to tell
you I won't be
coming here anymore.

36:29.532 --> 36:31.492
What?

36:31.576 --> 36:35.580
Archie, let's be
honest with each other,
we're not just friends...

36:35.663 --> 36:37.832
It's much more than that.

36:37.915 --> 36:43.004
You know it, I know it and
Justine knows it. And not
unnaturally, she resents it.

36:45.006 --> 36:48.175
Oh, hi.

36:48.259 --> 36:51.929
Lexie hasn't prepared
the banker's rations
so I'm going to sort it out.

36:57.476 --> 37:00.897
And it's causing us
all a lot of grief.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.733
So I've decided the only way
to make it more bearable

37:03.816 --> 37:07.361
is by just not to come
here and not to see you.

37:09.030 --> 37:10.865
(RAISED VOICES)

37:10.948 --> 37:12.867
I think we'd all be
a lot happier that way.

37:12.950 --> 37:16.203
-Katrina, you can't just...
-I'm sorry.

37:16.287 --> 37:18.205
LEXIE: She who
knows everything.

37:18.289 --> 37:19.498
JUSTINE: The little
games you play.

37:19.582 --> 37:21.667
LEXIE:
I don't play games, darling.

37:21.751 --> 37:24.670
You've been against me from
day one. A little look here,
a snide remark there.

37:24.754 --> 37:26.422
Listen, I fight battles and
I'm warning you

37:26.505 --> 37:28.799
before this one kicks off,
I take no prisoners.

37:28.883 --> 37:32.553
Of course, I know why.
Apparently yet another
female's after my boyfriend.

37:32.637 --> 37:34.764
Well, don't even
think about trying it!

37:34.847 --> 37:39.143
Despite your rather obvious
attractions, you're not
serious competition.

37:39.227 --> 37:42.438
For you? Listen here,
you've got as much charisma
as a rolled up carpet.

37:42.521 --> 37:46.067
And don't flare your nostrils
at that 'cause you'll get
house martins nesting in them!

37:46.150 --> 37:47.944
Right, that's it!

37:48.027 --> 37:50.905
-What is the problem now?
-BOTH: Her!

37:59.372 --> 38:03.751
-How are you feeling, Mary?
-I'm fine.

38:03.834 --> 38:08.297
You know, you're
really very kind, Fleming.
Do you know that?

38:08.381 --> 38:10.758
Girls are always saying that.

38:10.841 --> 38:14.053
I wish they'd call
me a filthy brute
one of these days.

38:15.972 --> 38:20.393
Right. Jump off at
the starboard side,

38:20.476 --> 38:24.689
swim underneath the boat
and climb back on
board on the port side.

38:24.772 --> 38:26.649
Right, who's first?

38:28.234 --> 38:30.319
I bought the teaspoons and the
garlic press,

38:30.403 --> 38:32.613
the wooden spoons.
As for the pots and pans...

38:32.697 --> 38:36.200
Will you stop going on about
the kitchen utensils and tell
me what all this is about?

38:36.284 --> 38:40.162
I am leaving Glenbogle
due to personal differences
with Mrs Laird here!

38:40.246 --> 38:42.331
She's got to go.
We cannot carry on like this!

38:42.415 --> 38:45.751
-Oh, you said it, girl!
-Right.
Fine. I'll help you pack!

38:45.835 --> 38:50.840
Will you both be quiet?
Let me think!

38:50.923 --> 38:53.050
Nobody does anything, okay?
Nobody moves.

38:53.134 --> 38:56.554
You, just stay here.
Justine, have you
got a minute, please?

38:59.473 --> 39:02.602
-This I have to hear.
-Oh no, Lexie. Lexie!

39:02.685 --> 39:05.813
Just give them
a bit of privacy.

39:05.897 --> 39:10.192
-I can't do this!
-That might have
unfortunate consequences.

39:10.276 --> 39:13.529
As you already hitched
a lift on Mr Fleming's car,
you're now in bottom place.

39:13.613 --> 39:16.115
That's not fair.
And anyway, I can't swim!

39:16.198 --> 39:19.201
Well, then you'll just
have to shut your eyes
and think of England.

39:19.285 --> 39:21.329
Jump!

39:21.412 --> 39:24.957
Mr Brown, you may have heard
of a historical personage
called Captain Bligh.

39:25.041 --> 39:27.585
He was
the commander of a vessel
called The Bounty,

39:27.668 --> 39:30.796
which also
happens to be the name
of my favourite chocolate bar!

39:30.880 --> 39:32.632
-What?
-Whoa!

39:36.219 --> 39:38.012
Fleming...

39:38.095 --> 39:41.390
FLEMING: Sorry, I
didn't have a plank to hand.

39:41.474 --> 39:43.142
And by the way, Mr Brown,
remember,

39:43.226 --> 39:47.104
in battle, complacency
is your greatest enemy.

39:47.188 --> 39:49.941
And I'd say that's you
sunk as well, old man.

39:54.779 --> 39:56.280
Oh!

39:56.364 --> 39:59.492
Hector, I'm going shopping,
is there anything you need?

39:59.575 --> 40:02.578
Some hardtack biscuits
and the Telegraph, dear.

40:02.662 --> 40:04.622
What are you doing?

40:04.705 --> 40:08.042
These cameras are in the
wrong place. I miss the hustle
and bustle of the house.

40:08.125 --> 40:10.753
-But with Duncan's help... Ah!
-Got it sorted.

40:10.836 --> 40:13.756
-Yeah.
-There.

40:13.839 --> 40:16.634
Splendid. Oh, I say.

40:16.717 --> 40:19.804
JUSTINE: You've obviously
got something to say
so why don't you say it?

40:19.887 --> 40:22.390
I know it's not easy
for you coming to a place

40:22.473 --> 40:25.309
-that I know isn't your
favourite spot in the world.
-No! It isn't!

40:25.393 --> 40:28.062
It was a sacrifice I
made to be with you.

40:28.145 --> 40:31.524
-Argh!
-MOLLY:
No, try again, try again!

40:31.607 --> 40:34.110
All I wanted to do
was see what she was
going to say to him.

40:34.193 --> 40:36.529
They've hardly
had a minute's peace
since they arrived.

40:36.612 --> 40:38.948
-Might I have a word?
-What?

40:39.031 --> 40:43.494
Don't say anything.
I must say this quickly.
I've been thinking.

40:43.578 --> 40:46.622
You said I should
have the courage
to follow my heart.

40:46.706 --> 40:48.833
Yeah?

40:48.916 --> 40:51.877
Would you have the courage
to follow it with me?

40:51.961 --> 40:53.546
Flem, the way I'm
feeling right now...

40:53.629 --> 40:57.216
Golly!
Lexie! Come and see this!

41:03.556 --> 41:07.143
ARCHIE: I know it's not easy
working with a group of people
you didn't choose yourself.

41:07.226 --> 41:09.395
Who can't stand me
but have the hots
for my boyfriend, yes!

41:09.478 --> 41:11.522
But you are forcing them out!

41:11.606 --> 41:14.984
People that I am fond of, yes,
but also people who
could help us here.

41:15.067 --> 41:16.903
Oh, come on, Archie! It's not
about other people.

41:16.986 --> 41:19.780
So why don't you tell me
what you really think?

41:19.864 --> 41:22.199
Go on, Archie, tell her!

41:22.283 --> 41:25.703
-I don't believe we
should be watching this.
-No.

41:25.786 --> 41:29.248
Right,
this isn't gonna be easy,
but it has to be said.

41:29.332 --> 41:32.543
Hector, could you possibly
turn up the volume a smidgen?

41:39.425 --> 41:42.386
I think you're taking over.
I think you're
trying to do everything.

41:42.470 --> 41:44.805
You're breathing
everyone else's oxygen.

41:44.889 --> 41:47.225
-Yours as well, I take it?
-Yes!

41:48.976 --> 41:53.856
Look,
Justine, this is my home,
my inheritance, my challenge.

41:53.940 --> 41:57.068
And there's no room for me?
That's what you're saying,
isn't it?

41:57.151 --> 41:59.695
No, I'm not. Of
course I'm not saying that!

42:00.780 --> 42:02.531
They're moving.

42:02.615 --> 42:04.033
No, no, no, Hector!

42:04.116 --> 42:05.868
(ALL TALKING)

42:05.952 --> 42:10.331
Right, so we just
click on Glenbogle.com.

42:10.414 --> 42:14.001
Let's see what we can see.
There's the loch.

42:14.085 --> 42:16.254
We all know the loch,
don't we?

42:18.547 --> 42:22.093
And remember, kids,
this is actually
happening right now.

42:24.220 --> 42:28.015
ARCHIE: You've got
it wrong, sweetheart,
and not for the first time.

42:28.099 --> 42:31.644
JUSTINE: Look,
I know I'm an outsider here,

42:31.727 --> 42:35.606
Glenbogle isn't my home.
That's a long way south
and I miss it like hell.

42:36.649 --> 42:39.151
My family,
my friends, my life...

42:41.821 --> 42:43.906
I gave it all up so
that we could be together.

42:43.990 --> 42:47.159
-I know that.
-But it's not working, is it?

42:49.370 --> 42:51.414
I don't mean other people,
I mean us.

42:54.166 --> 42:56.502
What do you think? Tell me.

43:04.719 --> 43:08.931
It's not the same.
It's different, you know.
We've changed.

43:11.017 --> 43:14.395
Can we get it back?
What we had once?

43:18.858 --> 43:20.276
I'm not sure that we can.

43:22.612 --> 43:23.946
I'm sorry.

43:26.407 --> 43:29.577
What do you think?

43:29.660 --> 43:32.997
To be honest,
I think I lost you
the moment you came up here.

43:34.999 --> 43:36.584
I curse this place.

43:40.880 --> 43:44.675
Thank you for being honest.
I'll go and pack my bags.

44:03.819 --> 44:05.571
Poor Archie.

44:06.781 --> 44:08.741
(COLLECTIVELY GROANING)

44:10.534 --> 44:14.205
-Poor Justine.
-How distressing.

44:15.623 --> 44:17.708
DUNCAN: Who needs Neighbours?

44:22.171 --> 44:23.506
Oh!

44:24.799 --> 44:28.094
Fleming!

44:28.177 --> 44:32.139
Off to ring head office, then?
You can tell them what to
do with their rotten job.

44:32.223 --> 44:34.934
He doesn't have to.

44:35.017 --> 44:36.936
I'm your new boss.

44:37.019 --> 44:38.729
Eh?

44:38.813 --> 44:41.357
I take over
as head of domestic
finance division next week.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.443
You?
You lied, you exploited us.

44:44.527 --> 44:48.030
I had to look
at the two of you
under challenging conditions.

44:48.114 --> 44:50.032
To find out which
of us gets the job?

44:50.116 --> 44:54.287
Well, downsizing is an option,
as is flattening out
management structures.

44:54.370 --> 44:58.457
Well, I consider myself
managerially flattened,
and personally reborn.

44:58.541 --> 45:01.669
-Anyway, I've made up my mind.
-Eh?

45:01.752 --> 45:05.006
Nigel, you are dull,
boorish, arrogant,

45:05.089 --> 45:08.342
totally lacking in
humour or compassion,
so you're fired.

45:08.426 --> 45:11.178
-But I have...
-I said you're fired.

45:19.395 --> 45:20.980
As for you, Fleming,

45:21.063 --> 45:24.901
you have shown courage,
leadership, loyalty

45:24.984 --> 45:27.486
and independence of spirit,
hasn't he, Mr Brown?

45:28.905 --> 45:32.700
In other words...Lancelot...

45:32.783 --> 45:35.494
my perfect number two.

45:35.578 --> 45:38.372
No, no...
No, you don't. I quit.

45:38.456 --> 45:43.628
I'm going to tinkle the
ivories for a living and she
will be my muse and manager.

45:44.712 --> 45:46.797
Flem, have you got a minute?

45:58.392 --> 46:01.646
You don't have to
run off like this.
I could drive you.

46:01.729 --> 46:02.855
To the station?

46:05.316 --> 46:06.484
No thanks.

46:10.613 --> 46:13.616
Say goodbye to
everyone for me, will you?

46:13.699 --> 46:16.369
Don't think I can
face them just now.

46:19.997 --> 46:23.042
We did love each other once,
didn't we, Archie?

46:23.125 --> 46:24.961
Yes, we did.

46:32.760 --> 46:34.053
Be happy.

47:06.877 --> 47:12.049
So she's gone and not
coming back? Which means
you're not going anywhere.

47:15.511 --> 47:17.179
I understand.

47:18.931 --> 47:21.309
Lucky old Archie.
That's what I say.

47:23.561 --> 47:25.521
You're a sweetie.

47:25.605 --> 47:28.691
My mother used to
say something similar.

47:28.774 --> 47:30.902
"Cough drop" she
used to call me.

47:40.870 --> 47:43.122
Oh.

47:43.205 --> 47:45.833
Well, I suppose I better go
and find Mary before she
offers that

47:45.917 --> 47:47.960
promotion to someone else.

47:49.670 --> 47:53.466
You know, Lex, I
rather think she fancies me.

48:08.689 --> 48:12.526
-Ah! Good man.
-Oh, it's lovely to
be back in our home.

48:12.610 --> 48:15.488
Yeah, fun though, wasn't it?
Thanks, Duncan.

48:15.571 --> 48:20.076
Heel, Monty, Rommel!
Come here. Heel.

48:54.527 --> 48:56.237
How are you doing?

48:59.407 --> 49:00.908
Pretty strange actually.

49:03.119 --> 49:07.540
-Justine has left.
-I know.

49:15.131 --> 49:19.635
It's weird.
We were together five years.

49:24.765 --> 49:30.354
I feel really sad but I
also feel lighter, you know.

49:30.438 --> 49:34.025
-Is that terrible?
-No.

49:41.240 --> 49:45.661
Anyway, I think I'm
going to need your help.

49:47.580 --> 49:49.040
Why do you think I'm here?

49:52.960 --> 49:58.216
I've had this idea about
hiring someone to help with
the tourist business.

49:59.300 --> 50:01.802
-What do you think?
-Hmm...

50:17.360 --> 50:18.694
Ah!

50:35.294 --> 50:36.254
Duncan!
