00:02.503 --> 00:03.795
Previously on
"The Girl from Plainville"...

00:03.795 --> 00:04.922
- I'm going to direct
your attention

00:04.922 --> 00:07.049
to July 12th of 2014.

00:07.049 --> 00:09.259
That was the last day
you saw your son alive.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.594
How was he that day?

00:10.594 --> 00:11.637
I know my son.

00:11.637 --> 00:15.098
And he didn't want to die.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.517
Not that day.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.101
- I'm here because
of Michelle Carter.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.896
I don't like seeing
innocent people prosecuted.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.689
I want to help this girl.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.525
- 48 Hours
wants to talk to me.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.859
- You gonna do it?
-He's not just

00:25.859 --> 00:27.736
a dead kid on the news,
you know.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.154
He's Coco.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.280
Go away.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.615
- What's wrong?

00:31.615 --> 00:34.243
- I'm the murderer's sister,
that's what's wrong!

00:34.243 --> 00:35.869
Get the fuck out!

00:35.869 --> 00:37.246
Can you read
the highlighted text message

00:37.246 --> 00:38.539
from Michelle?

00:38.539 --> 00:39.998
- "Then I am left crying
in bed at night

00:39.998 --> 00:41.250
"because I have no one

00:41.250 --> 00:43.669
"and I have no plans,
no future.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.379
I am nothing."

00:45.379 --> 00:48.799
- If you ever
tell anyone about me,

00:48.799 --> 00:54.596
I will never, ever
fucking talk to you again!

00:54.596 --> 00:55.847
Got it?

00:57.766 --> 00:59.309
Your text
freaked me out.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.103
Call me back.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.897
- I'm sorry.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.566
I didn't know
you cared that much.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.193
How could you say that?

01:50.193 --> 01:52.612
I don't even have
anybody's number.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.364
If something happened to you,
I wouldn't know who to call.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.199
- I know, I know, I'm--

01:56.199 --> 01:59.286
I'm sorry, okay?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.706
- Is this just a game to you?

02:02.706 --> 02:03.832
- No.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.641
- Then tell me what to do.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.851
Nothing.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.062
You've done plenty.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.565
- What does that mean?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.403
You've been here for me.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.197
You've listened.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.535
It's just not enough.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.917
I'm never satisfied.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.713
I'm stuck.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
In my own little reality,

02:53.715 --> 02:57.594
and I thought everything
was good, but...

02:59.304 --> 03:00.806
It's not.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.938
- I'm not going to leave you.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.399
You need me.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.946
Stay.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.245
Conrad?

03:42.514 --> 03:44.933
- Carter has waived
her right to a jury trial,

03:44.933 --> 03:46.977
which means
the judge alone will decide

03:46.977 --> 03:48.395
whether or not she is guilty.

03:48.395 --> 03:52.524
If convicted, she faces
up to 20 years in prison.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.692
Could you please describe

03:53.692 --> 03:55.152
your educational background?

03:55.152 --> 03:56.862
I went to Harvard

03:56.862 --> 03:59.281
and Case Western Reserve
Medical School,

03:59.281 --> 04:02.784
researching the
psychophysiology of anxiety.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.328
- And can you please
list and describe

04:05.328 --> 04:06.997
your professional activities?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.665
- Oh, golly.

04:08.665 --> 04:09.916
There's a lot of them.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.835
I have been
practicing psychiatry

04:11.835 --> 04:13.962
full time since 1968.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.422
I teach.

04:15.422 --> 04:20.427
I have a subspecialty
in clinical psychopharmacology.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.803
- And what is that?

04:21.803 --> 04:24.181
- It's the study
of the effect of drugs

04:24.181 --> 04:27.768
on the actual clinical,
real-life behavior of people.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.603
- And have you given
any presentations

04:29.603 --> 04:31.521
for any governmental bodies?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.523
Yes.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.608
- Well,
thank you for carving out

04:34.608 --> 04:35.984
some time with us today,
Dr. Breggin.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.486
You're quite a busy man.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.529
- Of course.
Thank you for the invitation.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.697
- Your Honor.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.824
- Move it along.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.367
Uh, Dr. Breggin,

04:44.367 --> 04:47.704
for our non-medical experts
in the room,

04:47.704 --> 04:51.208
could you illustrate, uh,
for us what an SSRI is

04:51.208 --> 04:53.043
and how it affects the brain?

04:53.043 --> 04:57.088
The SSRI is
a selective

04:57.088 --> 04:59.341
serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.426
- And what is serotonin?

05:01.426 --> 05:04.012
- Serotonin
is a neurotransmitter

05:04.012 --> 05:06.681
that originates deep
in the brain.

05:06.681 --> 05:10.060
It can affect our judgment,

05:10.060 --> 05:15.106
love, and empathy.

05:15.106 --> 05:19.653
When serotonin is naturally
created by the brain,

05:19.653 --> 05:22.989
these--these receptors fire.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.785
And the idea behind people
who are depressed or--or angry

05:26.785 --> 05:30.997
is that maybe the feed
to the receptor gets backed up.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.416
The brain isn't doing its job.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.460
- Right,
and the SSRI, it--what?

05:35.460 --> 05:36.711
The SSRI,

05:36.711 --> 05:40.423
like Prozac and all SSRIs,

05:40.423 --> 05:44.511
blocks the removal
of serotonin.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.013
And unfortunately,

05:47.013 --> 05:49.224
this is very unstable

05:49.224 --> 05:54.062
because the brain reacts
to this as a toxic intrusion.

05:54.062 --> 05:58.441
- And how does the brain
react to this toxic intrusion?

05:58.441 --> 06:01.027
After the first dose even,

06:01.027 --> 06:04.197
the brain stops
producing serotonin.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.575
- So instead
of creating a clear pathway

06:06.575 --> 06:10.370
for the serotonin
to enter the brain,

06:10.370 --> 06:14.165
Prozac and other SSRIs
can actually halt

06:14.165 --> 06:16.293
the natural production
of serotonin entirely?

06:16.293 --> 06:18.837
- Yes, it's possible.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.881
Oh.

06:20.881 --> 06:26.011
- Does the FDA identify
the SSRIs in a specific way?

06:26.011 --> 06:29.222
- They developed a
black box warning that remains

06:29.222 --> 06:32.976
the highest level class warning
for all of these drugs.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.020
- Does Celexa have
a black box warning?

06:35.020 --> 06:37.147
- Yes, it does.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.399
And do you know specifically

06:39.399 --> 06:43.069
what the black box warning
is on Celexa?

06:43.069 --> 06:46.281
- The black box warning
specifically says

06:46.281 --> 06:49.618
that there's
an increased risk of suicide

06:49.618 --> 06:53.413
in people aged 24 and younger.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.748
And to the best
of your knowledge,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.750
was Conrad Roy III

06:56.750 --> 06:59.210
on Celexa
at the time of his death?

06:59.210 --> 07:02.005
- Yes, he was.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.678
Thank you.
No further questions.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.639
We'll break for lunch.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.652
- Am I really selfish?

07:25.862 --> 07:27.364
- No.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.032
Why?

07:29.032 --> 07:31.368
- Well, for wanting
to kill myself so bad

07:31.368 --> 07:34.954
and dragging you along
with all this.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.998
- No.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.875
You're not selfish.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.543
Don't ever think that.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.464
And you're not
dragging me along.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.342
I chose to stay.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.929
- I don't want to fail again.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.764
That's what I'm scared of.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.475
- Obviously, you don't
really want to die then.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.728
Because you wouldn't
be scared to try.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.065
You'd want to try anything
as much as you could.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.780
- I guess
you're partially right.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.159
I'm just still
researching and hoping that

08:13.159 --> 08:15.704
I find a better way.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.580
- I am so right.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.881
Part of me wants you
to try something and then fail.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.470
Just so you could go get help.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.978
I love you.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.522
Say it back.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.819
- I love you too.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.492
- I'm gonna turn in.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.702
Okay.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.495
- You good?

08:57.495 --> 08:59.914
- Yeah, I'm good.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.293
- Don't stay up too late, okay?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.428
- Hey.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.971
Can I get a beer?

09:22.604 --> 09:24.189
- Is it over?

09:24.189 --> 09:27.025
- Lunch.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.569
Thank you.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.707
Some of this stuff
this doctor's saying...

09:44.334 --> 09:46.836
We thought we'd be doing
the right thing.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.338
Right?

09:49.798 --> 09:51.007
- Yeah.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.259
Yeah.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.222
I don't know.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.731
You know what
I can't stop thinking about?

10:06.731 --> 10:07.732
- What?

10:10.151 --> 10:13.029
- The fucking guacamole.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.239
- I mean, how the hell
has this kid

10:14.239 --> 10:16.449
never had guacamole before?

10:18.743 --> 10:21.579
Well, I mean, it's not like
we're known for it here.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.789
- Fair.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.586
Your mom says you're running.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.421
You even talked to my mom?

10:30.421 --> 10:32.715
- Yeah, you sent her over
to check on me.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.637
- I just didn't like the idea
of you being alone, that's all.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.440
I'm training
for the Boston Marathon.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.817
- You?

10:50.817 --> 10:51.943
Yeah?

10:51.943 --> 10:54.028
- You who drives two blocks.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.823
- I who used to
drive two blocks.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.284
- They say it makes
your nipples bleed.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.831
They're not lying.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.001
Hot.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.339
I'm doing it
for suicide awareness.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.674
Running it, I mean.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.970
You know, raising money for it.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.726
- That's good, Co.

11:24.726 --> 11:25.935
Yeah.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.316
- He'd be real proud.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.667
I tried drinking
all the water I could,

11:49.667 --> 11:52.587
but nothing happened.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.339
- What the fuck is that?

11:54.339 --> 11:56.132
Why didn't you
tell me you tried?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.509
All of a sudden, you're trying
and serious about it?

11:58.509 --> 12:00.678
- I'm sorry,
I want to tell you the truth,

12:00.678 --> 12:04.891
but I don't want to scare you.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.435
- I want you to always
tell me the truth.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.646
Never be sorry about it.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.610
- I want it to look
like an accident.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.613
- Why?

12:18.613 --> 12:20.740
Well, I'd like people

12:20.740 --> 12:25.119
to think that
and not feel guilty.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.208
Can I tell you something?

12:30.208 --> 12:32.168
Of course.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.673
- There's nothing anyone can do

12:36.673 --> 12:40.051
that's gonna make me
want to live.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.679
Come on!

12:42.679 --> 12:43.930
Come in!

12:46.766 --> 12:48.810
You okay?

12:48.810 --> 12:50.520
I can't really talk about it.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.106
- That doesn't sound good.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.525
"Ooh, Constantine!

12:55.525 --> 12:57.318
I love you, Constantine."

12:57.318 --> 12:58.945
- Give it back, Cassie--
- You guys write love letters.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.196
- Ooh, does he
send you dick pics?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.531
- I said give it back!

13:01.531 --> 13:03.116
- Jesus Christ, fine.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.325
I'm just playing.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.160
- This is life
and death, Cassie.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.545
Hey.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.630
I'm sorry about Cassie.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.382
She was--
Can be a bitch.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.635
- Sometimes.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.221
Now he's not responding.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.806
- Conrad?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.476
Talk to me.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.439
You can trust me.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.149
- Can I?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.234
Of course.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.236
I'm here for you.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.415
- God, he's so messed up.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.343
He'll only talk to me
about things,

14:04.343 --> 14:08.347
and he said that he won't
be with me anymore

14:08.347 --> 14:10.183
if I tell anyone.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.227
So you have
to promise me, okay?

14:13.227 --> 14:14.937
You can't tell anyone, Natalie.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.147
Seriously.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.148
You have to promise.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.274
- Of course.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.068
Of course,
I won't say anything.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.281
Is there anything I can do?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.454
Oh, it's just...

14:31.454 --> 14:33.456
I don't even know
where to begin.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.420
What information did you review

14:39.420 --> 14:41.047
in connection to this case?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.965
Every available medical record

14:42.965 --> 14:45.134
for Michelle and Conrad.

14:45.134 --> 14:49.472
I evaluated
every available text, uh,

14:49.472 --> 14:51.974
or phone or Facebook message
for both people.

14:51.974 --> 14:55.269
I interviewed
a half a dozen people

14:55.269 --> 14:57.980
in great detail
who knew Michelle.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.149
- And--and why the interviews?

15:00.149 --> 15:02.985
- I needed to get, uh,
a baseline

15:02.985 --> 15:04.946
for Michelle's behavior.

15:04.946 --> 15:08.449
Was Michelle known to do
mean, angry, hostile things?

15:08.449 --> 15:12.328
Before age 12 was key for me
because at 12,

15:12.328 --> 15:16.874
she begins to develop anorexia
and is put on Prozac,

15:16.874 --> 15:19.210
and she's then medicated
off and on

15:19.210 --> 15:21.546
for her entire adolescence.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.340
And did that have
any significance for you

15:24.340 --> 15:30.012
ultimately in forming
certain opinions on this case?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.640
- It shows that
she's a very vulnerable person

15:32.640 --> 15:34.725
who does very severe cutting
of herself

15:34.725 --> 15:37.520
in order to control her pain.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.230
And did the text messages

15:39.230 --> 15:42.191
between Michelle Carter
and Conrad Roy

15:42.191 --> 15:44.152
have any relevance
or significance

15:44.152 --> 15:46.988
to your clinical analysis
of the case?

15:46.988 --> 15:47.989
Oh, yes.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.992
He's a very distressed
young man

15:50.992 --> 15:52.743
who has a lot
of family conflict

15:52.743 --> 15:56.789
that, uh, he's dealing with,
and he is constantly

15:56.789 --> 15:59.792
telling Michelle that
he's gonna kill himself

15:59.792 --> 16:01.669
and there's nothing she can do.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.546
And this goes on and on

16:03.546 --> 16:08.801
for hours and hours
and months and months of text.

16:08.801 --> 16:13.347
And she gets more
and more desperate.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.225
And this boy that she loves

16:16.225 --> 16:19.145
says that he's going
to kill himself

16:19.145 --> 16:22.315
and that he's even got plans.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.027
This is an intolerable position
for her to be in.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.988
- Doctor.

16:28.988 --> 16:33.326
What is
involuntary intoxication?

16:33.326 --> 16:36.287
It means that
there's a disruption

16:36.287 --> 16:38.664
in the neurochemistry
of the brain

16:38.664 --> 16:41.876
where intoxication
is observable

16:41.876 --> 16:46.380
through thoughts
and behaviors, activities.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.674
And during an intoxication,

16:48.674 --> 16:52.094
the person generally
has loss of judgment,

16:52.094 --> 16:54.597
maybe confusion,

16:54.597 --> 16:57.850
and often
loss of memory of the event.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.019
And how do you
analyze and determine

17:00.019 --> 17:03.105
if someone is involuntarily
intoxicated by drugs?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.066
Well, first,

17:05.066 --> 17:07.068
you need to know,
can the drug do this?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.861
Does Celexa?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.948
Do all SSRIs cause marked
changes in behavior?

17:11.948 --> 17:13.741
Yes.

17:13.741 --> 17:17.495
And when SSRIs
cause abnormal reactions,

17:17.495 --> 17:21.040
which involuntary intoxication
is the extreme,

17:21.040 --> 17:25.169
they cause agitation,
anxiety, um,

17:25.169 --> 17:27.588
panic, irritability,

17:27.588 --> 17:31.467
and a dramatic, sometimes
instant, shift in behavior.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.511
It's in the diagnostic manual.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.180
And specifically,

17:36.180 --> 17:38.641
as to Michelle,
do you have an opinion

17:38.641 --> 17:42.019
as to whether or not she was
involuntarily intoxicated?

17:42.019 --> 17:45.565
- Yes, I do. Yes, she was.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.985
There's a significant change
in her behavior

17:48.985 --> 17:51.487
about 11 days
before Conrad's suicide

17:51.487 --> 17:53.072
on July 12th.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.615
And as a result of this

17:54.615 --> 17:58.661
involuntary intoxication
suffered by Michelle Carter,

17:58.661 --> 18:00.496
do you have an opinion
as to whether or not

18:00.496 --> 18:02.915
she was able to conform
her actions and conduct

18:02.915 --> 18:05.626
to the requirements of the law?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.587
- She couldn't.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.464
She was enmeshed in a delusion

18:10.464 --> 18:15.511
where she was thinking it was
a good thing to help him die,

18:15.511 --> 18:18.848
that she could mitigate
the circumstances,

18:18.848 --> 18:21.225
reassure him that he was
going to heaven,

18:21.225 --> 18:25.479
and that she could then go
to his family and help them

18:25.479 --> 18:28.316
to mourn less severely.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.943
And are you able to pinpoint,

18:30.943 --> 18:33.946
in your opinion, of course,
around

18:33.946 --> 18:38.618
when Michelle became
involuntarily intoxicated?

18:38.618 --> 18:41.370
On or about July 2nd,

18:41.370 --> 18:43.998
she begins to help him
go to heaven.

18:58.179 --> 19:02.016
- I don't know if it's
bad or good that you

19:02.016 --> 19:04.018
understand me this way.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.567
If I do end up...

19:13.194 --> 19:14.987
Dying...

19:17.531 --> 19:20.159
I don't...

19:20.159 --> 19:22.036
want to go to hell.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.040
I don't belong there.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.002
- You won't go to hell.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.296
I promise you.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.257
Heaven needs a hero.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.807
- You're gonna help me
with this tomorrow.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.645
- With what?

19:50.398 --> 19:54.694
- I've been reading
about it on the internet.

19:54.694 --> 19:58.364
I've been talking
to people online about it.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.865
- Talking to who?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.242
I don't know,

20:01.242 --> 20:04.120
it's the internet.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.667
- Are you really sure
you're gonna do this?

20:17.550 --> 20:22.972
- I'm going to try again.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.224
When I'm home.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.018
Tomorrow.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.070
- Promise me something.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.032
- Sure.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.869
- Say goodbye before you do it.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.620
Of course.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.209
How's he doing?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.256
- Not good.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.925
- Yeah.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.304
- It's a good thing
you're doing.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.680
Seriously.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.682
He's really lucky
to have a friend like you.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.230
- Girlfriend.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.315
Right.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.484
Girlfriend.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.573
- Thanks, Cassie.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.086
Some things
I've been doing is

21:36.086 --> 21:39.924
trying to realize that
it's not realistic.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.801
What's going on in my head

21:41.801 --> 21:44.845
that keeps on
piling and piling?

21:44.845 --> 21:47.640
- He wanted to excel.

21:47.640 --> 21:52.770
He just wanted to be this,
like, great person.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.940
And in my eyes,
he was all that.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.566
He was rough on himself.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.611
He really, really struggled

22:00.611 --> 22:05.658
with just disappointing,
I think, my husband and me.

22:08.160 --> 22:13.207
I don't understand
why you would want

22:13.207 --> 22:18.087
someone that was
so beautiful inside and out

22:18.087 --> 22:19.630
that had so much,

22:19.630 --> 22:23.676
that was
such a kind person to die.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.389
How do you describe

22:28.389 --> 22:31.058
what this young woman did?

22:31.058 --> 22:32.935
- I cannot.

22:32.935 --> 22:36.814
Only--only she can.

22:42.570 --> 22:45.614
Had to fight off a nurse
for a cruller.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.908
Worth it.

22:47.908 --> 22:52.121
Any bright ideas in
the half hour I've been gone?

22:52.121 --> 22:53.789
No.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.625
I don't know how to get him.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.670
I--you saw, Moniz loves him.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.797
He trusts him.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.424
None of this was in the report.

23:03.424 --> 23:07.761
Nothing about cutting or--
or "involuntary intoxication."

23:07.761 --> 23:10.431
I mean,
what the hell even is that?

23:10.431 --> 23:13.434
I can't prepare overnight.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.685
Well, maybe that's it.

23:14.685 --> 23:17.563
I mean, he didn't say
any of it in the report.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.442
Gonna have to get him
to bury himself.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.822
You said during
your direct examination

23:26.822 --> 23:28.866
that the defendant
had been cutting, correct?

23:28.866 --> 23:31.285
- Yes.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.913
- Would you agree with me
that your initial

23:33.913 --> 23:35.581
60 or so page report

23:35.581 --> 23:38.584
didn't mention
anything about that, correct?

23:38.584 --> 23:40.836
- Correct.
I didn't have those texts.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.212
Would it be
fair to say that

23:42.212 --> 23:45.925
her mother never reported
any concern about cutting?

23:45.925 --> 23:49.303
I didn't interview Mom
in that depth.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.846
- May I approach, Your Honor?

23:50.846 --> 23:53.098
Mm-hmm.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.310
Didn't you write here,

23:56.310 --> 23:57.811
page 60,

23:57.811 --> 24:01.023
"Michelle's mother cannot
recall any bizarre behavior

24:01.023 --> 24:04.652
"on Michelle's part
at any time of her life,

24:04.652 --> 24:08.113
including during the period
of the alleged crime."

24:09.573 --> 24:11.158
- Yes.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.953
- So you at least talked
to her a little bit.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.704
- Yes.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.247
- And in that conversation,

24:17.247 --> 24:21.877
she did not report any concerns
about her daughter at all.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.630
No, she didn't.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.007
- The information that
you had about her cutting

24:27.007 --> 24:30.094
was based on text messages
with her friends?

24:30.094 --> 24:31.720
Yes.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.889
And now, of course, when you
looked at these messages

24:33.889 --> 24:36.850
where she was talking about
how severely she cut herself,

24:36.850 --> 24:38.852
you would also look
at other messages

24:38.852 --> 24:41.730
she sent to other people
contemporaneously?

24:41.730 --> 24:44.608
- Yes, she often sent
different messages

24:44.608 --> 24:46.276
to different people.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.487
- And it would be
significant to you

24:48.487 --> 24:52.408
if, uh, she was simultaneously
texting one person

24:52.408 --> 24:54.326
that she was cut so badly,

24:54.326 --> 24:56.245
she had to go
to the emergency room

24:56.245 --> 24:58.247
and then a moment later,
texting a boy

24:58.247 --> 24:59.790
something completely different.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.625
Yes, she did that a lot

25:01.625 --> 25:03.419
about a lot
of different things.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.712
Yes.

25:04.712 --> 25:07.297
But in these texts,

25:07.297 --> 25:09.717
she is claiming that
she's talking to her mother

25:09.717 --> 25:12.344
about going to the hospital,
correct?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.388
- Yes.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.557
Isn't it true that
at the initial outset

25:16.557 --> 25:19.226
of your involvement
in this case,

25:19.226 --> 25:22.479
you did not diagnose
the defendant as depressed?

25:22.479 --> 25:25.149
- Well, yes,
that was the knowledge

25:25.149 --> 25:27.901
I had at the time.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.528
- You were wrong?

25:29.528 --> 25:31.030
- Oh, golly, yeah.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.158
- You completely
misdiagnosed the defendant?

25:34.158 --> 25:35.701
- No.
-Well--

25:35.701 --> 25:38.579
I'm sorry, uh, you said
she wasn't depressed,

25:38.579 --> 25:40.748
and now you're saying she is?

25:40.748 --> 25:43.959
- I literally did not
have enough information.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.713
And I didn't know that I didn't
have very much information.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.507
- Oh, but when you
talked to the defendant...

25:52.134 --> 25:54.511
- I never talked
to the defendant.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.188
- How many times
have you formed the opinion

26:04.188 --> 26:08.609
that a patient or someone
you've been asked to examine,

26:08.609 --> 26:12.529
uh, is involuntarily
intoxicated?

26:12.529 --> 26:15.324
Golly, maybe...

26:15.324 --> 26:18.702
40 times
over the last 20 years?

26:18.702 --> 26:20.245
It's really a wild guess.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.583
- A wild guess.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.668
So one of the things
you need to do

26:26.668 --> 26:29.546
in forming a baseline
is determining if the behavior

26:29.546 --> 26:33.717
during the period in question
is of stark contrast

26:33.717 --> 26:36.887
to his or her normal behavior,
correct?

26:36.887 --> 26:38.263
- Yes.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.225
- Would you agree with me that
if your baseline is off,

26:41.225 --> 26:43.435
it could greatly affect
your opinion?

26:43.435 --> 26:46.563
- That's why I
carefully rechecked my opinion

26:46.563 --> 26:49.858
and found that everything
in there reconfirmed

26:49.858 --> 26:52.736
the date she had the breakdown
of the intoxication.

26:54.029 --> 26:58.408
- Right, you--you were saying
that happened on, uh, July 2nd?

26:58.408 --> 26:59.701
- Yes.

26:59.701 --> 27:03.122
- It's important that
it happened on July 2nd

27:03.122 --> 27:05.374
because it shows
that she had a break.

27:05.374 --> 27:09.253
She behaved one way
on July 1st and on July 2nd,

27:09.253 --> 27:11.713
she behaved entirely
differently

27:11.713 --> 27:13.882
because of the intoxication,

27:13.882 --> 27:15.634
and it was completely
out of her control.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.511
Do--do I have that right?

27:17.511 --> 27:18.846
Yes.

27:24.059 --> 27:29.147
- Uh, "What about hanging
yourself or stabbing yourself?

27:29.147 --> 27:31.775
"What about overdosing
on sleeping pills

27:31.775 --> 27:34.820
"or suffocating
with a plastic bag?

27:34.820 --> 27:37.823
"Sleeping pills would work,

27:37.823 --> 27:39.741
"but if you really want to die,

27:39.741 --> 27:42.619
I don't get why
you wouldn't try it."

27:42.619 --> 27:44.830
Yes, correct, exactly.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.749
- But you said that her
behavior changed on July 2nd?

27:47.749 --> 27:48.834
- Yes.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.461
- Well, these text messages

27:51.461 --> 27:53.881
from Michelle Carter
to Conrad Roy

27:53.881 --> 27:58.760
were sent on June 29th, 2014.

28:02.389 --> 28:05.434
You're taking my words
out of context.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.269
Okay.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.021
May I approach?

28:12.399 --> 28:16.278
Can you please tell the court
what this book is?

28:16.278 --> 28:20.657
- Yes, it's the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual

28:20.657 --> 28:23.327
of Mental Disorders,
the DSM-5.

28:23.327 --> 28:27.915
- An encyclopedia of every
diagnosed mental disorder.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.416
Yes.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.543
Could you grab
the section that covers

28:31.543 --> 28:33.962
involuntary intoxication
for me, please?

28:33.962 --> 28:38.091
- Well, there is no section
on involuntary intoxication.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.635
It's a legal term.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.015
- Well, then, what are
you diagnosing her with?

28:45.015 --> 28:47.935
- Oh, she has
drug intoxication.

28:47.935 --> 28:50.354
It's in the general group...

28:50.354 --> 28:51.563
Of substance-induced

28:51.563 --> 28:52.940
mood disorders.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.983
- So it's not in there.
- Well, it's--

28:54.983 --> 28:57.027
Sir, I'm asking whether or not

28:57.027 --> 29:00.280
the DSM-5 has
a specific criteria

29:00.280 --> 29:04.576
for the diagnosis
of involuntary intoxication,

29:04.576 --> 29:07.621
the diagnosis that you are
providing for the defendant.

29:07.621 --> 29:08.914
Is it in there?

29:08.914 --> 29:11.166
- Well, no.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.543
It's a legal--
- Legal term.

29:15.629 --> 29:16.797
I tender the witness,
Your Honor.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.934
Sorry, I took some
sleeping pills

30:10.934 --> 30:12.936
and I fell asleep.

30:21.695 --> 30:25.032
- You said you wanted this bad.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.369
I knew you wouldn't try hard.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.955
I feel like such an idiot.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.623
Why?

30:36.960 --> 30:40.505
- Because you didn't even
do anything.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.924
You lied
about this whole thing.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.511
I'm just--

30:46.511 --> 30:49.097
I'm just so confused because...

30:55.437 --> 30:59.566
I thought
you really wanted to die.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.194
But apparently you don't.

31:05.363 --> 31:08.909
I just feel played
and just stupid.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.494
Don't.

31:10.494 --> 31:15.749
I found out a new plan,
and I'm gonna do it.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.837
- I don't believe you.

31:23.757 --> 31:27.385
You're gonna have
to prove me wrong

31:27.385 --> 31:30.889
because I don't think
you really want this.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.558
You just keep pushing it
to another night.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.772
And you never do it.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.155
- Okay.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.449
- Okay what?
Okay.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.618
I'll prove you wrong.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.279
If I were that judge,

32:27.279 --> 32:28.905
you know what I'd say?

32:28.905 --> 32:30.448
"Your parents aren't
going to miss you

32:30.448 --> 32:33.493
if you're locked up
for the next 30 years."

32:33.493 --> 32:35.537
This is evil.
Turn it off.

32:35.537 --> 32:36.913
Where does evil come from?

32:36.913 --> 32:38.039
- It's the news.
- Your sister does not

32:38.039 --> 32:39.040
need to hear this right now.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.292
Turn it off, Hayden.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.043
- He was an easy target.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.004
It's all about attention,

32:44.004 --> 32:45.297
people noticing her.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.757
- We're just
supposed to ignore it?

32:47.757 --> 32:49.384
- I'm not doing this
with you right now, sorry.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.886
No, you know what
everyone thinks of me

32:50.886 --> 32:52.762
in school, in this town?

32:52.762 --> 32:55.098
Hayden, I am sorry,
but this is not helping.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.558
We can't be watching
this garbage right now.

32:56.558 --> 32:57.976
- You should go get ready.
No, you always yell

32:57.976 --> 33:00.228
at me and I don't understand.
It's always about her.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.563
- Don't be dramatic.
- I'm serious.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.690
All you do is focus on her,
talk about her.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.526
Your closing argument,
Mr. Cataldo.

33:13.491 --> 33:17.370
- The medical examiner
ruled the death a suicide.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.372
Now, there's no statute
in the state of Massachusetts

33:19.372 --> 33:21.374
outlawing suicide,
there's no statute

33:21.374 --> 33:23.251
in the state of Massachusetts
that says

33:23.251 --> 33:25.128
it's against the law to help

33:25.128 --> 33:28.590
or assist in a suicide.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.759
The evidence shows
that Conrad Roy

33:30.759 --> 33:34.262
was suicidal for a very,
very lengthy period of time.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.057
That comes out in the text
messages very clearly,

33:37.057 --> 33:39.517
and Miss Carter was
under no legal duty

33:39.517 --> 33:42.062
to call for assistance.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.564
The evidence also shows
in the text messages

33:44.564 --> 33:47.067
that Conrad Roy

33:47.067 --> 33:50.445
specifically sought out
her encouragement.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.281
Your Honor, I believe that

33:53.281 --> 33:54.574
the Commonwealth
has failed to provide

33:54.574 --> 33:58.286
any evidence that
Miss Carter caused him to die.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.455
Thank you.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.791
Thank you, Mr. Cataldo.

34:04.626 --> 34:07.003
Who's arguing
for the Commonwealth?

34:07.003 --> 34:08.213
- Okay.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.339
Okay.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.722
- I'm not just gonna
stand here and say,

34:17.722 --> 34:19.307
"Look at Commonwealth v.
Carter"

34:19.307 --> 34:21.059
and sit down, Your Honor.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.937
With regards
to the offense of manslaughter,

34:23.937 --> 34:26.815
I would, uh,
suggest that the Commonwealth

34:26.815 --> 34:30.235
needed to prove that
the conduct was intentional,

34:30.235 --> 34:32.195
not that the outcome
was intentional,

34:32.195 --> 34:34.531
but that the conduct was.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.616
I believe we have done that.

34:36.616 --> 34:40.120
Your Honor,
I ask that you consider

34:40.120 --> 34:43.331
not just what you know
about Conrad,

34:43.331 --> 34:45.417
but what you have learned
about the defendant

34:45.417 --> 34:48.003
through the course of all this.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.880
The defendant clearly had many,

34:50.880 --> 34:55.176
what she believed, to be
substantial relationships,

34:55.176 --> 34:57.137
mostly through texting.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.889
And for Mr. Cataldo to suggest

34:59.889 --> 35:04.644
that Conrad had free will
is an oversimplification

35:04.644 --> 35:07.063
because she knew him.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.149
She knew he had social anxiety.

35:11.109 --> 35:15.113
She knew that he was depressed.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.699
She knew his frailties.

35:17.699 --> 35:21.828
And not only that, Your Honor,
she knew what it was like

35:21.828 --> 35:25.582
to feel lonely
and want someone to talk to.

35:25.582 --> 35:28.543
And she did talk to him
that night

35:28.543 --> 35:32.797
and she told him
to get back in the truck.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.467
Yes, the medical examiner
has said this is a suicide,

35:35.467 --> 35:37.552
but she is not
the final determiner

35:37.552 --> 35:39.220
of what the crime here is.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.306
You are, Your Honor.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.226
Thank you.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.749
- We should go home.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.628
We're here for your sister.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.507
- She doesn't want me here.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.385
- Well, your mother
needed to take a night off.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.642
- Do you think
the judge likes me?

36:31.523 --> 36:34.484
- It doesn't have anything
to do with him liking you.

36:43.118 --> 36:46.871
Is that--what the--
the doctor was saying,

36:46.871 --> 36:48.581
is that what happened?

36:51.376 --> 36:53.086
Did you black out?

37:05.014 --> 37:06.391
I wish you would talk to me.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.686
I wish you knew that
you could talk to me.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.731
I...

37:17.235 --> 37:19.237
I love you no matter what.

37:20.613 --> 37:23.074
I will always be here for you,

37:23.074 --> 37:25.118
no matter what.

37:30.999 --> 37:34.085
- You should just go in
without me.

37:36.713 --> 37:39.299
- I can't.

37:39.299 --> 37:40.633
- It's okay.

37:40.633 --> 37:44.137
No, you're not allowed
to be left alone.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.141
We'll just let them get
through the first few songs

37:48.141 --> 37:50.059
and then we'll go in.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.378
- I'd like to perform
a song for someone

38:17.378 --> 38:19.631
very special to me
that's here tonight.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.467
My sister, Michelle.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.594
Michelle, come up here.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.518
Come on.
- Go on.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.635
Sit.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.884
Stop!

41:12.261 --> 41:13.596
- You okay?
