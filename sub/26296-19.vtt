- I don't...
- You have a house...

08:33.255 --> 08:34.972
a really beautiful house.

08:35.058 --> 08:36.097

and a dog

08:39.403 --> 08:41.082

08:41.169 --> 08:42.440

08:42.525 --> 08:44.396

08:50.608 --> 08:52.003
Look, I'm not quite sure

08:52.096 --> 08:53.285
- what you expected...
- In my head,

08:53.370 --> 08:55.917
you worked at
a diner half as nice as this.

08:56.650 --> 08:58.331
And you didn't graduate high school,

08:58.417 --> 09:00.057
or maybe you did
but a year or two late

09:00.143 --> 09:02.240
'cause they don't let pregnant
girls finish high school.

09:02.325 --> 09:04.979
And you scraped
by somehow on...

09:05.064 --> 09:06.995
hard work
and the kindness of strangers,

09:07.081 --> 09:08.283
but you had no one.

09:08.368 --> 09:09.815
You had nothing.

09:09.901 --> 09:12.159
That would make it okay
that I left you?

09:14.419 --> 09:17.371
I wanted you to have a better
life than I could give you...

09:17.456 --> 09:19.749
Now, <i>that</i> part
I heard in my head.

09:19.842 --> 09:21.319
I think it came

09:21.405 --> 09:23.569
- from a made-for-TV movie.
- No, I-I-I realized it

09:23.655 --> 09:26.330
the minute it came out
of my mouth, yes, um...

09:28.233 --> 09:29.700
But it's true.

09:31.341 --> 09:33.304
I really thought that
you'd be better off...

09:33.390 --> 09:34.514
What are their names?

09:34.600 --> 09:36.405
- I'm sorry?
- Your kids.

09:36.491 --> 09:39.788

cereal in your perfect kitchen.

09:39.874 --> 09:41.179

09:41.265 --> 09:43.797
Alexandra is a senior in high school,

09:43.882 --> 09:46.585
and, uh, Josh is in 10th.

09:48.287 --> 09:52.231
And your husband, the,
what, the... accountant?

09:52.390 --> 09:53.702

09:54.128 --> 09:55.654
Is he my father?

09:56.121 --> 09:57.332
No.

09:57.496 --> 09:59.847
No, he is nothing like... no.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.905
No, I met my husband in grad school.

10:01.991 --> 10:03.317

10:03.402 --> 10:04.492
His name is Daniel.

10:04.578 --> 10:05.734
Daniel.

10:06.725 --> 10:08.452
That's nice.

10:09.139 --> 10:10.499
That's really nice.

10:10.616 --> 10:13.093
You know,
I-I... I appreciate a girl

10:13.179 --> 10:14.187
with fire in her belly, but...

10:14.272 --> 10:16.450
I didn't have a better life.

10:17.271 --> 10:19.349
I wasn't better off.

10:20.551 --> 10:22.429
No one found me
adoring parents

10:22.515 --> 10:25.179
who were dying for a newborn
of their own to love.

10:25.265 --> 10:27.358
I lived in foster homes
so bad,

10:27.444 --> 10:29.850
it was better
to live in my car.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.452
And when a man finally told me
that he loved me,

10:32.538 --> 10:34.201
I believed him,

10:35.379 --> 10:39.293
even when he beat the crap out
of me so bad I couldn't see.

10:40.116 --> 10:42.457
So whatever life you had,

10:42.694 --> 10:45.621

than mine.

in the mix.

mental illness that I'm aware...

11:41.366 --> 11:44.202

I, um...
I grew up on a farm in Kansas.

11:52.811 --> 11:55.179
My childhood is a blur of chickens

11:55.265 --> 11:57.225
and singing songs
out in the field

11:57.311 --> 11:58.562
when I should've been

- Forget it.

and I will try and find him.

And I said no.

13:52.972 --> 13:54.622
And I continued to say no.

...I was not the person
I am today.

27:53.364 --> 27:54.981
I was not in my right mind.

27:55.067 --> 27:57.416
I wasn't in my mind
at all.

27:59.403 --> 28:05.012
That night that...
that he held me down, screaming.

28:06.283 --> 28:09.335
That night that he had
his hands around my throat

28:09.629 --> 28:11.481
until I stopped screaming,

28:11.567 --> 28:13.864
when I was hovering over
my own body

28:13.950 --> 28:16.250
while he was tearing away
at me,

28:16.388 --> 28:18.912
that night that he smiled

28:19.072 --> 28:23.285
and he forced me to say
that I liked it,

28:24.384 --> 28:26.660
when he laughed and...

28:28.613 --> 28:32.149
...promised that we could do it
any time that I wanted to...

28:34.520 --> 28:38.790
...that was the night
that I lost my right mind.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.777
He stole it from me,
and for nine months...

28:42.862 --> 28:45.542
for nine months,
I pretended I was fine.

28:45.908 --> 28:48.234
I pretended that
I wasn't a zombie,

28:48.367 --> 28:51.285
that I wasn't numb
or dead inside.

28:51.904 --> 28:54.089
And then, the day that
you were born,

28:54.175 --> 28:57.503
I held you, and
I looked at your face,

28:57.589 --> 28:58.693

29:40.753 --> 29:43.144
when my ex-husband cracked
my ribs

29:43.230 --> 29:45.550
and threw me across
the living room floor.

29:47.226 --> 29:48.855
He didn't know that I was pregnant,

29:48.941 --> 29:52.980
and I decided in that moment
that he could never know.

29:55.172 --> 29:58.175
I couldn't... I couldn't see a way out.

And whether you tell
your husband or you report it

38:31.197 --> 38:34.067
or you don't tell another soul,
you're a survivor.

38:34.188 --> 38:35.940
You survived.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.229
I still feel nauseous
when I see

38:39.315 --> 38:42.089
men in expensive shoes
with the points of the toes,

38:42.174 --> 38:44.573
because that's how my ex-husband
made my kidney bleed.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.295
For years, I thought
I got what I deserved,

38:47.380 --> 38:49.932
that I was responsible,
that maybe,

38:50.032 --> 38:54.619
just maybe if I had said or done
one thing differently...

38:54.805 --> 38:56.403

your fault.
