08:15.462 --> 08:17.629
Yeah, but you know, "vessel"
sounds cooler.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.392
Was he an alcoholic?

08:47.394 --> 08:48.827
No. Cop.

08:48.829 --> 08:52.497
He actually busted
the other two dads.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.567
Do you feel at peace?

08:55.569 --> 08:56.902

08:58.138 --> 08:59.738
Johnny?

08:59.740 --> 09:02.207
[snoring]

09:03.844 --> 09:05.844
Greg dulli stole my vibe.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.879
Dave grohl stole my aura.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.014
And this whole thing with flash,

09:09.016 --> 09:10.415
Sometimes i'm--

09:10.417 --> 09:12.517
I'm nervous that the only thing

09:12.519 --> 09:14.886
That's drawing me
to him is that, you know,

09:14.888 --> 09:17.856
Is that father figure
i never had.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.692
Makes me look, what?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.527
You said you're--you're
practiced in the art

09:22.529 --> 09:23.528
Of soul retrieval, right?

09:23.530 --> 09:24.930
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.698
Can you suck my vibe
back out of dulli

09:26.700 --> 09:30.035
And my aura out
of dave grohl's asshole, huh?

09:30.037 --> 09:32.704
Have you seen
steven tyler naked?

09:32.706 --> 09:34.372
I mean, besides emotionally.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.074
What are my triggers?

09:36.076 --> 09:40.946
I don't know, pepperoni pizza,
jelly doughnuts, cake.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.881
I like salmon.
I know that's weird.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.783
Not that fattening,
but if you eat the whole thing.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.852
This is the first time i've
ever had a family all together,

09:47.854 --> 09:51.957
And it would be--you know,

09:51.959 --> 09:53.959
Worse than not getting famous
or anything like that;

09:53.961 --> 09:55.961
It'd be really devastating
if that fell apart.

09:55.963 --> 10:00.432
You know, the jonah complex
is about destiny,

10:00.434 --> 10:05.971
And maybe your destiny
wasn't to be a rock star.

10:05.973 --> 10:11.476
Maybe it was just
to be a good father.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.311
Really?

10:13.313 --> 10:14.779
You're strong.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.416
Maybe too strong.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.884

10:19.886 --> 10:21.219
You're very beautiful.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.253

10:22.255 --> 10:23.421

10:23.423 --> 10:24.389
I don't look like claire danes,

10:24.391 --> 10:25.457

You're very beautiful.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.731
Are you hitting on me?

10:41.341 --> 10:44.509
Each band
has a family dynamic,

10:44.511 --> 10:50.348
And this family, it seems to me,
has lost its communal bond.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.084
Now, this nakota ritual,
which i call "the egg and i,"

10:53.086 --> 10:56.021
Is designed
to restore that bond.

10:56.023 --> 11:00.191
Now, the goal is
to take each delicate egg

11:00.193 --> 11:02.661
And pass it from person
to person,

11:02.663 --> 11:06.297
And then put back safely
in its nest.

11:06.299 --> 11:10.702
Each egg represents
a family member,

11:10.704 --> 11:15.106
And if it breaks,
so does that family member.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.141
Questions?

11:16.143 --> 11:17.642
Yeah, why is my egg weird?

11:17.644 --> 11:19.144
(dr. Ball)
all the eggs are the same.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.679
- Mine's not.
- They're the same.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.614
Maybe it's weird
because you're different, bro.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.149
Well, i want my egg
to be different.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.784
Why don't you
try dyeing it black?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.652
[laughter]

11:27.654 --> 11:32.190
It doesn't really matter
what color the eggs are, okay?

11:32.192 --> 11:35.326
So, bam,
start with the first egg,

11:35.328 --> 11:37.696
And pass it around the room.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.964
Sure. Thanks.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.700
- Come on, bam bam.
- You got this.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.201

pick johnny.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.003

11:45.005 --> 11:48.673

11:48.675 --> 11:50.742
You got it.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.110

11:54.347 --> 11:58.049
- Don't make a thing out of it.
- I'm not.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.684
- Oh!
- Shit!

11:59.686 --> 12:01.219
Did you do that on purpose?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.887
- Give me the goddamn eggs.
- No, no, no--oh!

12:02.889 --> 12:04.556
- Oh now, i got one--oh!
- Oh!

12:04.558 --> 12:06.758

that was not elegant.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.526
Oh, look.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.495
Mine wasn't different.
It was special.

You are a hateful person.

to ava and rehab,

12:24.177 --> 12:26.010

12:26.012 --> 12:30.048

that i would like to initiate

12:30.050 --> 12:33.685
A ritual called "hear my voice."
