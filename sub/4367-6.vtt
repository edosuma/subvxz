00:01.623 --> 00:03.991
You are being watched.

00:03.993 --> 00:06.326
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.328 --> 00:10.981
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.983 --> 00:13.483
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.485 --> 00:15.318
but it sees everything...

00:15.320 --> 00:18.372
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.374 --> 00:21.375
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.377 --> 00:23.677
We don't.

00:23.679 --> 00:27.965
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:27.967 --> 00:30.050
You will never find us.

00:30.052 --> 00:32.386
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.387 --> 00:35.681
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:39.527 --> 00:41.478
Olivia wants to extend
the trial separation

00:41.480 --> 00:43.030
another six months.

00:43.032 --> 00:45.182
Neither one of us is willing
to bring up the D word.

00:45.184 --> 00:48.235
When you get married,
you think you found the one.

00:48.237 --> 00:49.319
I mean, how do you know?

00:49.321 --> 00:50.771
I mean, how does anyone know?

00:50.773 --> 00:53.723
Well, I'm no authority
on these matters.

00:53.725 --> 00:55.409
But if you want
to take some time off,

00:55.411 --> 00:57.077
work things out--

00:57.079 --> 00:58.361
Work's the one thing

00:58.363 --> 01:00.114
that keeps my mind
off the situation.

01:00.116 --> 01:02.365
So tell me, how goes
our little experiment?

01:02.367 --> 01:04.635
I'm glad you asked.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:16.397 --> 01:18.565
What do you make
of that man on the bench?

01:18.567 --> 01:21.318
Looks like he tied one on
a little too tight.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.786
Bet you'd never believe me
if I told you

01:22.788 --> 01:24.938
he was a violin prodigy
who played two years

01:24.940 --> 01:26.490
with the Philharmonic.

01:26.492 --> 01:29.409
His penchant for the bottle
cut his career short.

01:29.411 --> 01:33.831
How exactly does this
help stop terrorism?

01:33.833 --> 01:35.365
Before I could teach
the machine

01:35.367 --> 01:36.617
to find bad people,

01:36.619 --> 01:38.702
I had to teach it people
in general.

01:38.704 --> 01:42.539
I programmed it
to identify outliers...

01:42.541 --> 01:47.044
Individuals who are...
interesting in some way.

01:47.046 --> 01:48.295
To teach a machine

01:48.297 --> 01:50.514
the complexities
of human nature--

01:50.516 --> 01:52.633
I mean,
no offense, Harold, but...

01:52.635 --> 01:55.418
is someone
as introverted as you

01:55.420 --> 01:57.888
the best person for the job?

02:01.759 --> 02:04.862
Oh. Who's Molly Cole?

02:04.864 --> 02:07.397
I have no idea.

02:07.399 --> 02:11.033
24-year-old graduate
student at NYU.

02:11.036 --> 02:13.787
Major in astrophysics.

02:13.789 --> 02:16.957
Says you were
with her last night.

02:16.959 --> 02:18.792
So work must not be
the only thing

02:18.794 --> 02:20.777
that's kept your mind off
the separation.

02:20.779 --> 02:23.446
So what's your point?

02:23.448 --> 02:26.083
You asked me
if the machine was capable

02:26.085 --> 02:27.334
of learning human nature.

02:27.336 --> 02:30.804
I'm saying it already is.

02:30.806 --> 02:32.589
It's learning
by watching everyone.

02:32.591 --> 02:35.559
Even you.

02:37.395 --> 02:40.597
Oh, that's odd.

02:40.599 --> 02:42.482
What?

02:42.484 --> 02:46.603
That woman painting
at the railing.

02:46.605 --> 02:47.905
Grace Hendricks.

02:47.907 --> 02:49.356
Freelance artist.

02:49.358 --> 02:51.358
Volunteers
at a children's shelter.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.611
But beyond that,
no anomalies that I can see.

02:54.613 --> 02:56.947
Why did it show her to us?

02:56.949 --> 02:58.248
Must be a bug.

02:59.484 --> 03:00.584
I'll go over the code again,

03:00.586 --> 03:02.703
see if I missed something.

03:02.705 --> 03:05.255
Hmm.

03:05.257 --> 03:09.509
Well, at least the machine
is showing us it has good taste.

03:23.842 --> 03:25.776
Aah! Bear!

03:25.778 --> 03:27.394
What did we discuss
about boundaries?

03:29.848 --> 03:31.014
Morning, Finch.

03:31.016 --> 03:32.616
Impeccable timing,
Mr. Reese.

03:32.618 --> 03:35.285
I've just begun digging
into our latest number.

03:37.872 --> 03:40.324
A little stingy
on the sprinkles.

03:43.194 --> 03:44.628
Graham Wyler.

03:44.630 --> 03:46.546
A 42-year-old family man.

03:46.548 --> 03:48.215
Owns a small hardware store
with his wife

03:48.217 --> 03:49.249
in Far Rockaway.

03:49.251 --> 03:50.717
The suburbs?

03:50.719 --> 03:52.469
Never had a number
out there before.

03:52.471 --> 03:56.006
Unfortunately, murder isn't
confined to a zip code.

03:56.008 --> 03:57.557
I'll get eyes on the family.

03:57.559 --> 03:59.927
I wouldn't go back
to this place.

04:10.154 --> 04:12.155
Wyler moved to the city

04:12.157 --> 04:14.491
from Fort Wayne, Indiana,
in 1997.

04:14.493 --> 04:16.660
He's been married
to his wife Connie

04:16.661 --> 04:18.946
for 14 years.

04:18.947 --> 04:20.747
- And the daughter?
- Izzy.

04:20.749 --> 04:23.000
Honor student
at Sandburg Junior High

04:23.002 --> 04:24.584
and soccer star.

04:24.586 --> 04:26.119
Wyler's mortgage is affordable.

04:26.121 --> 04:27.921
His credit is good.

04:27.923 --> 04:30.023
Family only owns one car,
free and clear.

04:30.025 --> 04:34.544
So we found
the most boring man in New York.

04:34.546 --> 04:36.596
See the black smudges
in the air vent?

04:36.598 --> 04:38.298
'Cause your motor's fried.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.217
Come back in an hour,
and I'll have it fixed for you.

04:40.219 --> 04:41.685
Great.
How much do I owe you?

04:41.687 --> 04:43.403
Just buy
your next drill with me,

04:43.405 --> 04:44.638
we'll call it even.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.139
All right, Saturday's fine.

04:46.141 --> 04:47.674
Okay, bye-bye.

04:47.676 --> 04:49.343
That was Mrs. Beckett.

04:49.345 --> 04:51.278
She just guilted me into helping
with the PTA fundraiser.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.230
She wouldn't know
what to do without you.

04:53.232 --> 04:57.901
Neither would I,
for that matter.

04:57.903 --> 05:00.120
Probably looking
for the sharpening kit

05:00.122 --> 05:03.957
for his machete.

05:06.661 --> 05:09.046
Can I help you, sir?

05:09.048 --> 05:10.613
I told you
to call before you showed up.

05:10.615 --> 05:12.082
You trying to get me busted
with my wife?

05:12.084 --> 05:13.500
Whatever, man.

05:13.502 --> 05:14.784
You want these or not?

05:14.786 --> 05:18.505
Yeah, just make it fast,
all right?

05:18.507 --> 05:19.622
Looks like Wyler
might be dealing

05:19.624 --> 05:21.825
more than power tools, Finch.

05:29.283 --> 05:31.301
- How's practice?
- Hi.

05:31.303 --> 05:33.636
- Mm.
- Mm. We did shuttle runs all day.

05:33.638 --> 05:35.322
- Yeah? Sounds like fun.
- Yeah.

05:35.324 --> 05:39.476
Want to see something?

05:39.478 --> 05:41.478
Tickets to Bruce Springsteen?

05:41.480 --> 05:44.147
Front row seats,
for mom's birthday.

05:44.149 --> 05:45.282
Pretty awesome, right?

05:45.284 --> 05:46.316
It's kinda lame, dad.

05:46.318 --> 05:47.501
Well, how about this, then?

05:47.503 --> 05:50.337
No way! You fixed it!

05:50.339 --> 05:52.155
Oh, thank you.

05:52.157 --> 05:53.957
All right, Finch,
this guy's a saint.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.492
I'm not so sure.

05:55.494 --> 05:58.378
I took a closer look
at his employment history.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.597
Hard to see how he had the money
to move east,

06:00.599 --> 06:02.766
much less,
support a city lifestyle.

06:02.768 --> 06:05.168
Maybe he met
a reclusive billionaire?

06:05.170 --> 06:06.536
In the event that he didn't,

06:06.538 --> 06:08.838
I made a few phone calls
around Fort Wayne,

06:08.840 --> 06:12.192
claiming to be a genealogist
working on a family tree.

06:12.194 --> 06:15.062
And I did uncover
one record of interest.

06:15.064 --> 06:16.863
And what's that?

06:16.865 --> 06:19.199
His death certificate.

06:19.201 --> 06:22.852
The real Graham Wyler died
in 1997.

06:22.854 --> 06:24.538
Whoever you've been following

06:24.540 --> 06:26.339
stole his identity
and has been using it

06:26.341 --> 06:28.358
for the past 15 years.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.626
He's ghosting.

06:29.628 --> 06:31.962
Built a life
on a dead man's name.

06:31.964 --> 06:33.363
Might be better
if we were less concerned

06:33.365 --> 06:34.548
with who this man is,

06:34.550 --> 06:36.700
and more concerned
with who he was.

06:37.753 --> 06:39.136
Afternoon.

06:39.138 --> 06:40.303
I haven't seen you
around here before.

06:40.305 --> 06:41.321
You new in town?

06:41.323 --> 06:43.640
Passing through, actually.

06:43.642 --> 06:45.008
Unfortunately, not fast enough.

06:45.010 --> 06:46.560
You're in a no parking zone.

06:46.562 --> 06:49.513
Any way you could let me off
with a warning?

06:51.766 --> 06:55.268
So shall I pay this
out of petty cash?

06:55.270 --> 06:57.854
Harder to tail someone in
the suburbs than in the city.

06:57.856 --> 06:59.489
I heard.

06:59.491 --> 07:01.825
Your man-in-the-suit routine
doesn't exactly play.

07:01.827 --> 07:03.527
As it happens,

07:03.529 --> 07:05.395
there's a quaint three-bedroom

07:05.397 --> 07:07.330
that's just gone on the market

07:07.332 --> 07:08.498
across from the Wyler's home.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.950
You can move in tomorrow.

07:09.952 --> 07:11.451
Move in?

07:11.453 --> 07:12.502
You're gonna be neighbors.

07:12.504 --> 07:14.754
I also procured a new vehicle,

07:14.756 --> 07:16.072
an appropriate wardrobe,

07:16.074 --> 07:17.574
and a set of golf clubs.

07:17.576 --> 07:19.909
There is one element
of your cover

07:19.911 --> 07:22.596
that you'll have
to acquire on your own.

07:28.686 --> 07:30.137
John.

07:30.139 --> 07:31.505
I'm sorry to hear
that it didn't work out

07:31.507 --> 07:33.673
with that reporter Maxine.

07:33.675 --> 07:36.309
I'll get over it.

07:36.311 --> 07:38.261
I was actually thinking...

07:38.263 --> 07:41.031
<i>we</i> should spend
a little more time together.

07:41.033 --> 07:42.732
Is that so?

07:42.734 --> 07:44.818
What is it this time?

07:44.820 --> 07:46.236
More power players
or cover-ups?

07:46.238 --> 07:48.705
Not exactly.

07:48.707 --> 07:51.774
Zoe Morgan...

07:54.111 --> 07:58.048
will you be my wife?

08:29.529 --> 08:30.746
Remember when you saved me

08:30.748 --> 08:32.063
from being tortured and killed

08:32.066 --> 08:33.616
by corporate hit men?

08:33.618 --> 08:35.267
Consider us even.

08:35.269 --> 08:37.068
That mean you don't want me

08:37.071 --> 08:39.038
to carry you
across the threshold?

08:42.577 --> 08:43.708
When this is over,

08:43.711 --> 08:44.793
I might have to fight you

08:44.795 --> 08:47.413
for custody of the dog.

08:54.722 --> 08:56.138
Miss me already, Harold?

08:56.140 --> 08:58.140
Actually, I wanted
to thank Ms. Morgan

08:58.142 --> 08:59.975
for offering her services.

08:59.977 --> 09:03.095
Suburban dad
with a mysterious secret?

09:03.097 --> 09:04.346
How could I resist?

09:04.348 --> 09:06.181
Plus, somebody had to see to it

09:06.183 --> 09:08.133
that John didn't burn down
the block.

09:08.135 --> 09:10.019
We'll see what happens.

09:10.021 --> 09:12.404
Right now, our main concern is
to ID Wyler,

09:12.406 --> 09:13.822
figure out who he really is.

09:13.824 --> 09:15.407
Any ideas on how to become

09:15.409 --> 09:16.992
the Wyler's new best friends?

09:16.994 --> 09:18.143
A few.

09:18.145 --> 09:19.528
I'll visit Wyler at his store,

09:19.530 --> 09:21.830
tell him we just moved
across the street.

09:21.832 --> 09:23.449
Once we've established contact,

09:23.451 --> 09:25.918
we'll be able to manipulate
the family into--

09:27.788 --> 09:29.321
John, it's a doorbell.

09:29.323 --> 09:31.373
Let's try not
to shoot any girl scouts

09:31.375 --> 09:33.859
on our first day, okay?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.180
Hi.

09:38.182 --> 09:39.515
Sorry to bother you.

09:39.517 --> 09:40.766
Just wanted to stop by

09:40.768 --> 09:42.134
and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

09:42.136 --> 09:44.019
- I'm Connie Wyler.
- Graham.

09:44.021 --> 09:45.137
John Campbell.

09:45.139 --> 09:46.689
This is my wife Zoe.

09:46.691 --> 09:48.474
It's nice to meet you both.

09:48.476 --> 09:50.142
I made you guys some Ambrosia.

09:50.144 --> 09:51.527
Just bring
the dish back anytime.

09:51.529 --> 09:52.895
We're right across the street.

09:52.897 --> 09:54.813
Mmm.
This looks delicious.

09:54.815 --> 09:57.149
We're having some people over
this afternoon for a barbecue.

09:57.151 --> 09:58.367
You should stop by
if you're not busy.

09:58.369 --> 10:00.352
Well, we'll be there.

10:00.354 --> 10:01.797
Great.
See you then.

10:05.359 --> 10:07.376
That was easy.

10:10.213 --> 10:11.997
Oh, thanks.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.882
Couldn't help but notice
your car earlier.

10:13.884 --> 10:15.217
Thing of beauty.

10:15.219 --> 10:16.502
How much she set you back?

10:16.504 --> 10:19.088
Actually, it's a company car.

10:19.090 --> 10:21.423
Man, I must have picked
the wrong business.

10:21.425 --> 10:22.591
What do you do?

10:22.593 --> 10:24.710
I sell
private security systems.

10:24.712 --> 10:27.179
Homes, offices.

10:27.181 --> 10:28.731
You know, if you're interested,

10:28.733 --> 10:30.733
I could get you a great deal
on some equipment.

10:30.735 --> 10:31.817
No thanks.

10:31.819 --> 10:33.686
Kind of old-school, low-tech.

10:33.688 --> 10:36.071
I reinforced the locks
on my doors and windows.

10:36.073 --> 10:37.606
That's pretty much all the
security you need around here.

10:37.608 --> 10:39.908
Sounds like you've got it
all figured out.

10:39.910 --> 10:42.111
Except how
to get people into my store.

10:42.113 --> 10:43.395
It's getting harder and harder

10:43.397 --> 10:45.531
to keep up
with the big box chains.

10:45.533 --> 10:46.832
No one appreciates

10:46.834 --> 10:50.619
an honest man trying
to make a living.

10:50.621 --> 10:52.905
I'll drink to that.

10:52.907 --> 10:55.174
How long have the two of you
been living in Rockaway?

10:55.176 --> 10:57.126
Oh, about ten years.

10:57.128 --> 10:59.545
Graham and I moved here
after my mother got sick,

10:59.547 --> 11:00.879
so we came out to help.

11:00.881 --> 11:02.347
What about you guys?

11:02.349 --> 11:04.717
How did you meet John?

11:04.719 --> 11:08.554
Uh, I was, um, stranded...

11:08.556 --> 11:11.056
in a bad part of town.

11:11.058 --> 11:12.474
And he gave me a ride.

11:12.476 --> 11:15.144
And we actually spent
the rest of the evening

11:15.146 --> 11:16.779
running around the city.

11:18.315 --> 11:21.867
Oh, you know, John kind of
reminds me of Graham,

11:21.869 --> 11:25.370
when we first moved out here,
kind of restless.

11:25.372 --> 11:27.956
Don't worry, he'll calm down.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.708
Ooh, another wine cooler?

11:29.710 --> 11:32.494
Uh, what about a Manhattan Up?

11:32.496 --> 11:33.746
How do you make that?

11:33.748 --> 11:36.331
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.384
Dad, have you seen my necklace?

11:39.386 --> 11:41.003
No, not since I fixed it.

11:41.005 --> 11:43.305
If you cleaned your room
once in a millennium--

11:43.307 --> 11:44.890
- I'll keep looking for it.

11:44.892 --> 11:47.092
Who do we know in Philadelphia?

11:47.094 --> 11:49.261
No one, never been there.
Why?

11:49.263 --> 11:51.430
This postcard came.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.768
Oh, my gosh!
He's adorable.

11:55.770 --> 11:57.319
Hi!

11:57.321 --> 12:00.739
Oh, you're so cute!
Who's a good boy?

12:00.741 --> 12:03.158
Would you mind manning
the grill for a moment?

12:03.160 --> 12:06.945
Sure.

12:22.796 --> 12:25.798
Wyler's spooked
about something.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.083
Whatever he's hiding,
he kept it from everyone.

12:28.085 --> 12:29.601
Connie's in the dark.

12:29.603 --> 12:32.304
Let's see
if we can shed some light, then.

12:32.306 --> 12:35.390
You got a makeup brush?

12:57.131 --> 12:58.530
Carter.

12:58.532 --> 13:00.666
You think you can run
a print for me?

13:00.668 --> 13:02.167
You find another bad guy?

13:02.169 --> 13:04.309
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.290
That guy doesn't look so bad.

13:08.292 --> 13:11.009
As for the print,
I wouldn't hold your breath.

13:11.011 --> 13:12.210
It's a partial.

13:12.212 --> 13:13.912
Start with a search
in Philadelphia.

13:13.914 --> 13:16.348
We're not getting
on a plane to Philly, are we?

13:16.350 --> 13:20.152
Not at the moment.

13:20.154 --> 13:22.738
What now?

13:22.740 --> 13:24.356
We wait.

13:24.358 --> 13:27.058
Uh, the party never stops
when you're around.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.360
What do these people do
for fun?

13:28.362 --> 13:29.561
Beats me.

13:29.563 --> 13:31.496
Got any ideas?

13:34.418 --> 13:36.952
♪ Boom boom boom boom ♪

13:36.954 --> 13:38.170
♪ I'm gonna shoot you
right down ♪

13:40.007 --> 13:43.086
Suburbs might not be
so bad after all.

13:44.879 --> 13:49.765
In or out... dear?

13:52.518 --> 13:54.770
Ever known me
to run from a fight?

13:54.772 --> 13:57.940
Pair of aces.

13:57.942 --> 14:00.392
Two pair.

14:00.394 --> 14:03.695
♪ And walk that walk ♪

14:03.697 --> 14:06.832
♪ and walk that walk ♪

14:10.370 --> 14:12.788
Lemonade, sir?
.50¢.

14:12.790 --> 14:15.540
Here you go.

14:15.542 --> 14:18.493
Have a good night's rest,
Mr. Reese?

14:18.495 --> 14:20.879
Think I fared better
than Wyler.

14:20.881 --> 14:22.965
He looks exhausted.

14:22.967 --> 14:24.616
Did you change the oil
in the car this morning?

14:24.618 --> 14:27.636
No, I forgot.
Sorry.

14:27.638 --> 14:29.388
You okay?

14:29.390 --> 14:31.640
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

14:31.642 --> 14:32.958
Hey!

14:32.960 --> 14:35.811
Sorry about that, Lloyd.

14:35.813 --> 14:37.346
You know that guy?

14:37.348 --> 14:40.098
No, he must have confused me
with someone else.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.600
You hear that, Finch?

14:41.602 --> 14:44.169
Sounds like more than
a case of mistaken identity.

14:51.828 --> 14:54.947
Mystery man just took off
with a friend.

14:54.949 --> 14:57.983
Could be the same men
that sent Wyler the postcard.

14:57.985 --> 15:01.653
Something tells me they're not
in town for a reunion.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.126
I'm open!

15:15.803 --> 15:16.852
Detective.

15:16.854 --> 15:18.470
I found your guy.

15:18.472 --> 15:20.171
He was only arrested once,

15:20.173 --> 15:22.190
for a misdemeanor B&E,
back in '91,

15:22.192 --> 15:24.192
but was wanted
for a string of robberies

15:24.194 --> 15:25.277
and home invasions.

15:25.279 --> 15:27.029
He was a career thief.

15:27.031 --> 15:29.197
I'm sure Philly PD would love

15:29.199 --> 15:30.682
to have a talk with him.

15:30.684 --> 15:31.984
Let me guess.

15:31.986 --> 15:33.402
First name's Lloyd.

15:33.404 --> 15:34.870
Lloyd Pruitt.

15:34.872 --> 15:35.871
How'd you know?

15:35.873 --> 15:37.189
Wild guess.

15:37.191 --> 15:40.158
- Did he work with a crew?
- Yeah, a couple other guys.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.377
Chris Vaughn
and Daniel Burnside.

15:42.379 --> 15:43.962
They had a good run
until they got caught

15:43.964 --> 15:46.048
taking a jewelry store in '97.

15:46.050 --> 15:47.332
Did 12 years.

15:47.334 --> 15:49.551
I guess your guy Lloyd missed
that job

15:49.553 --> 15:51.803
or disappeared
before they got picked up.

15:51.805 --> 15:53.805
He was busy
becoming Graham Wyler,

15:53.807 --> 15:55.474
giving himself a clean slate.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.476
- Go get it!
- He picked a good time to run.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.977
That job they got busted on,

15:58.979 --> 16:01.546
Vaughn shot an unarmed guard.

16:01.548 --> 16:03.899
He's dangerous.

16:03.901 --> 16:07.218
Thanks for your help, Carter.

16:07.220 --> 16:10.522
Good job!

16:19.999 --> 16:22.384
- Good play out there.
- Thanks, mom.

16:31.911 --> 16:33.545
Finch, Vaughn's here.

16:33.547 --> 16:36.414
I'm gonna have
a few words with him.

16:54.734 --> 16:57.602
Whoa! No way!

16:57.604 --> 16:59.237
Whose car is that?

16:59.239 --> 17:02.958
Wait.
Stay back.

17:06.747 --> 17:09.414
Sucks about the car, Lloyd.

17:09.415 --> 17:11.133
Nice running into you today,
though.

17:11.135 --> 17:12.467
Why don't we grab a drink?

17:12.469 --> 17:13.919
The Wallbanger, in the city.

17:13.921 --> 17:15.670
Noon tomorrow.

17:15.672 --> 17:17.839
We've got some catching up
to do.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.258
Ah!

17:24.181 --> 17:26.765
Finch, looks like Wyler's past
has come back to haunt him.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.215
You'll have access
to all the camera feeds

17:47.217 --> 17:48.249
through your cell phone.

17:48.251 --> 17:49.684
And this alarm system,

17:49.686 --> 17:50.885
does it call the local police?

17:50.887 --> 17:52.387
No-no, no.

17:52.389 --> 17:55.056
It sends a signal
to a private response team.

17:55.058 --> 17:56.808
You're doing the right thing.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.310
Yeah, Connie's still shaken up
about the car fire.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.881
And for all we know, it
could be a couple of teenagers.

18:02.883 --> 18:04.532
How are we doing, Harold?

18:04.534 --> 18:07.652
Almost finished, boss.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.487
Okay, if Wyler's old crew
attempt

18:09.489 --> 18:11.072
to gain access to the house,

18:11.074 --> 18:12.523
we'll see them coming.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.358
Vaughn's been smart so far.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.027
Cops couldn't find
the evidence on the SUV

18:16.029 --> 18:17.629
to point to a culprit.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.464
Speaking of Vaughn,
I combed through his files.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.532
In each of the jobs that
he and his crew have pulled,

18:21.534 --> 18:23.001
a safe was cracked

18:23.003 --> 18:25.253
using a technique called
"lock manipulation."

18:25.255 --> 18:27.572
No drilling, no tools.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.040
All of it done by ear.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.058
This is a lost art.

18:30.060 --> 18:31.709
But in the last heist,

18:31.711 --> 18:33.177
there was a difference.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.479
Vaughn shot the guard

18:34.481 --> 18:36.380
to motivate
the jewelry store manager

18:36.382 --> 18:37.882
to open the safe.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.535
The one job
Wyler didn't show up for.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.637
He was the safecracker.

18:42.639 --> 18:44.439
Bailed on the last job.

18:44.441 --> 18:47.025
They blame him
for getting locked up.

18:47.027 --> 18:48.943
A detail they'll,
no doubt, remind him of

18:48.945 --> 18:49.944
when they meet this afternoon.

18:49.946 --> 18:51.246
Honey, you in here?

18:51.248 --> 18:52.664
Hey, so I just got

18:52.666 --> 18:54.231
off the phone
with the insurance company.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.450
They say they can't send
an investigator out

18:55.452 --> 18:56.734
till next week.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.119
Where are you going?

18:58.121 --> 18:59.671
I need to go get something
for the store.

18:59.673 --> 19:01.405
Okay, well, hang out
for a second, okay?

19:01.407 --> 19:03.207
They say they can't cover
the cost of a rental.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.276
It can wait!

19:05.278 --> 19:08.479
All right?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.915
Look...

19:10.917 --> 19:12.934
I need to go, okay?

19:12.936 --> 19:14.385
Can we handle this later?

19:14.387 --> 19:15.720
I can handle it myself.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.655
It's a couple
of stupid phone calls.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.390
What's going on with you?

19:19.392 --> 19:20.925
Nothing you need
to worry about.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.727
Graham, if there's something
going on

19:22.729 --> 19:24.062
you think you can't tell me,

19:24.064 --> 19:25.563
get over it.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.650
Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together.

19:28.652 --> 19:31.319
I'll be back in a few hours.

19:34.323 --> 19:36.607
Graham, where are you headed?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.910
Catching a train into the city.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.662
I'm meeting a client there.

19:40.664 --> 19:42.413
Let me give you a lift.

19:42.415 --> 19:46.167
Save you some time.

19:49.565 --> 19:50.546
Thanks

19:55.928 --> 19:58.980
Quiet life takes
some getting used to.

19:58.982 --> 20:01.766
Not your speed, huh?

20:01.768 --> 20:04.152
You know, a lot of guys
in home security

20:04.154 --> 20:05.853
used to be in law enforcement.

20:05.855 --> 20:07.588
Were you a cop or something?

20:07.590 --> 20:09.140
Not me.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.942
Too many rules.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.977
Always had more fun
breaking them.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.446
Guess we all got
to grow up sometime, right?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.031
Certainly never thought
I would.

20:17.033 --> 20:18.333
What changed?

20:18.335 --> 20:20.585
Me.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.486
Used to just look out
for myself.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.489
Now I look out
for Connie and Izzy.

20:25.491 --> 20:28.993
Nothing I wouldn't do for them.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.328
Ungh!

20:31.330 --> 20:33.598
Seems that Wyler's past

20:33.600 --> 20:37.435
threatens not only his life
but his marriage as well.

20:40.889 --> 20:44.475
I'll be back.

20:47.346 --> 20:50.031
I've never seen him
angry like that.

20:50.033 --> 20:52.283
He's probably just got
a lot on his mind.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.951
You know,
with the car and the--

20:53.953 --> 20:55.519
It's not that.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.688
The whole time I've known him,

20:57.690 --> 20:59.957
Graham has always been
the one with the solution.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.878
But today, I didn't even know
who that was.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.364
You know, I never asked you
how you two met.

21:07.366 --> 21:10.201
We met at
a Springsteen concert in Jersey.

21:10.203 --> 21:13.921
This creep wouldn't stop
hitting on me.

21:13.923 --> 21:16.007
And suddenly Graham appeared.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.392
I'd never seen him before,

21:17.394 --> 21:19.227
but he pretended
to be my boyfriend

21:19.229 --> 21:21.262
so the other guy would go away.

21:21.264 --> 21:22.930
And I could just tell

21:22.932 --> 21:27.485
there was something different
about him.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.121
That one moment changed
your whole life.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.556
Yeah.

21:32.558 --> 21:36.561
Is that what it was like
when you first met John?

21:36.563 --> 21:37.862
I can honestly say

21:37.864 --> 21:41.132
that I wouldn't be here
without him.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.118
It's rare to find someone
you can depend on.

21:52.711 --> 21:53.961
Ready to have some fun?

21:55.414 --> 21:57.198
You're good
at connecting people

21:57.200 --> 22:00.218
to the things they don't
want the world to know.

22:00.220 --> 22:01.886
How good are you
at finding connections

22:01.888 --> 22:05.773
that no one knows exists?

22:05.775 --> 22:08.526
Try to tell me
if there's a correlation

22:08.528 --> 22:12.280
between the cowboy
and the taxi driver.

22:16.152 --> 22:17.434
Fifth cousins?

22:17.436 --> 22:19.737
Really?

22:19.739 --> 22:22.390
We do live
in the great melting pot.

22:22.392 --> 22:24.108
Okay.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.493
What's the association

22:25.495 --> 22:27.111
between this jogger and--

22:33.218 --> 22:35.086
It's her again.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.453
So you've found
something interesting

22:36.455 --> 22:37.922
on Grace Hendricks?

22:37.924 --> 22:40.424
No?

22:40.426 --> 22:44.362
Then is she connected
to anyone else in the park?

22:44.364 --> 22:46.630
I thought I fixed this.

22:46.632 --> 22:50.568
You haven't found a single
anomaly in this woman's life.

22:51.687 --> 22:53.271
She's honest, decent,

22:53.273 --> 22:55.973
doesn't seem
to have any dark secrets.

22:55.975 --> 22:59.193
Doesn't harbor
ill will toward anyone.

23:01.780 --> 23:05.583
Which is what sets her apart
from everyone else here.

23:07.753 --> 23:11.839
That and a passionate love
for Charles Dickens.

23:29.507 --> 23:31.726
I can take
a cab back from here.

23:31.728 --> 23:33.177
Thanks for the ride.

23:33.179 --> 23:36.030
You're welcome.

23:52.497 --> 23:53.664
Trying a new look?

23:53.666 --> 23:56.417
More like missing my old one.

23:56.419 --> 23:59.804
Your boys have been
in there for half an hour.

24:02.841 --> 24:07.211
He showed.
You owe me 20 bucks.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.096
How'd you find me?

24:09.098 --> 24:11.933
That is a real fun story.

24:11.935 --> 24:13.017
I was at work.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.385
Dishwasher.

24:14.387 --> 24:16.354
Only kind of job
a con like me could get.

24:16.356 --> 24:18.555
My boss shows me
this Facebook photo.

24:18.557 --> 24:21.309
Some babe he's plowing
in New York.

24:21.311 --> 24:22.493
I look.

24:22.495 --> 24:24.161
I can't believe my eyes.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.397
There's Lloyd Pruitt...

24:26.399 --> 24:28.783
standing in the background
of this photo.

24:28.785 --> 24:30.368
My long lost friend.

24:30.370 --> 24:31.786
Smiling, laughing,

24:31.788 --> 24:33.371
beautiful daughter next to him

24:33.373 --> 24:36.424
in her nice school sweater.

24:36.426 --> 24:38.593
It's a hell of a life
you've made for yourself, Lloyd.

24:38.595 --> 24:40.711
Wish I was spending my days
selling hammers.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.447
Beats 12 years in the
Fromhold State Penitentiary.

24:43.449 --> 24:44.915
Was it 12?
It felt longer.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.083
Yeah, felt like 50.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.234
That's my fault?

24:47.236 --> 24:49.353
I told you
the job was dangerous.

24:49.355 --> 24:50.938
But you thought
you were invincible.

24:50.940 --> 24:52.256
And that's why I walked.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.274
How noble.

24:53.276 --> 24:54.609
The way we see it,

24:54.611 --> 24:55.876
you owe us,

24:55.878 --> 24:57.311
and we're here to collect.

24:57.313 --> 24:59.897
So that's it?

24:59.899 --> 25:03.200
You're gonna kill me
over ancient history?

25:03.202 --> 25:05.636
Lloyd, you're
the best safecracker we know.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.455
Why would we want to kill you?

25:07.457 --> 25:10.908
We're gonna break into
an Everhold safe.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.460
It's a high-road job.

25:12.462 --> 25:14.578
We need your midas touch.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.448
In fact, the score's so big,

25:17.450 --> 25:20.501
when we're done,
we're leaving the country.

25:20.503 --> 25:22.953
So get your affairs in order.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.306
What's stopping me
from going to the cops...

25:25.308 --> 25:26.991
about you two right now?

25:35.500 --> 25:37.234
It's a lovely home.

25:37.236 --> 25:40.488
Next time we take something
with a heartbeat.

25:43.859 --> 25:45.326
What are you doing?

25:46.529 --> 25:47.828
They threatened his family.

25:47.830 --> 25:49.697
I'm taking 'em down.

25:49.699 --> 25:51.648
Can you take it easy instead?

25:51.650 --> 25:53.117
It's broad daylight, John.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.752
We're two blocks away
from my precinct.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.705
These guys need to go away
for a long time, Carter.

25:57.707 --> 25:59.156
Then catch them in the act.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.624
Right now, all we've got

26:00.626 --> 26:02.843
is conspiracy
to commit a robbery.

26:02.845 --> 26:05.096
And that's
from an illegal wiretap.

26:05.098 --> 26:07.715
It won't be enough to keep
them from Wyler or his family.

26:07.717 --> 26:09.133
Then I'll make them understand

26:09.135 --> 26:10.551
they can never
go near his family again.

26:10.553 --> 26:11.969
Okay.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.137
So are you gonna watch
this family forever

26:13.139 --> 26:14.342
to make sure they listen?

26:19.728 --> 26:22.113
Tomorrow, 10:00 PM.

26:22.115 --> 26:24.448
We'll pick you up
at that intersection.

26:27.536 --> 26:30.738
Be there, Lloyd.

26:37.462 --> 26:39.696
I slipped a burner phone
on their truck.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.332
We can track them with it.

26:41.334 --> 26:42.550
If they make the wrong move,

26:42.552 --> 26:43.584
we'll grab them.

26:43.586 --> 26:46.754
What about Wyler?

26:46.756 --> 26:48.872
He's got a decision to make.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.331
♪ It serve you right
to suffer ♪

27:17.403 --> 27:20.237
♪ serve you right to be alone ♪

27:24.076 --> 27:27.962
♪ it serve you right
to suffer ♪

27:27.964 --> 27:31.132
♪ serve you right to be alone ♪

27:35.054 --> 27:39.106
♪ because you're still livin' ♪

27:39.108 --> 27:44.979
♪ in days done past and gone ♪

27:52.605 --> 27:55.039
♪ yeah ♪

27:57.610 --> 28:00.277
Wyler's due to meet Vaughn
in an hour, Finch.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.463
What are we gonna do if
he goes through with the job?

28:02.465 --> 28:05.132
What do you suggest?

28:05.134 --> 28:07.501
We take him out
of the equation.

28:07.503 --> 28:11.722
He still has open warrants
in Philly.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.425
With Wyler serving jail time,

28:14.427 --> 28:16.210
there's
not much Vaughn could do.

28:16.212 --> 28:17.645
We'd risk breaking up
his family.

28:17.647 --> 28:19.246
They might never forgive him.

28:19.248 --> 28:20.898
I know the prospect
of a normal life

28:20.900 --> 28:22.817
seems remote
to people like us, Mr. Reese.

28:22.819 --> 28:25.319
But wyler still has a chance
to preserve his.

28:25.321 --> 28:26.720
Graham? Are you in here?

28:26.722 --> 28:31.025
Graham?

28:37.549 --> 28:38.833
Check the cameras, Finch.

28:38.835 --> 28:40.918
Make sure
he hasn't already left.

28:44.322 --> 28:47.324
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid Wyler's
made our decision for us.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.592
He left 15 minutes ago.

28:48.594 --> 28:49.993
Avoided his own camera.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.712
He's meeting Vaughn
for the heist.

28:51.714 --> 28:53.497
His number's up, Finch.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.218
When he's done cracking
that safe,

28:57.220 --> 28:59.386
Vaughn's got no reason
to keep him alive.

29:09.643 --> 29:12.461
Finch, I need
to know where Wyler is.

29:12.463 --> 29:14.814
What's the GPS location
on Burnside's pickup?

29:14.816 --> 29:16.015
Somewhere in Hell's Kitchen.

29:16.017 --> 29:17.933
Hang on.

29:17.935 --> 29:19.769
It's an impound lot.

29:19.771 --> 29:21.404
They're pulling up stakes,

29:21.406 --> 29:23.105
ditching all traces.

29:23.107 --> 29:24.523
What about tracking the safe?

29:24.525 --> 29:26.358
Everhold may make
a quality safe,

29:26.360 --> 29:27.993
but their firewall leaves
something to be desired.

29:27.995 --> 29:30.529
I'm looking
at their client list.

29:30.531 --> 29:32.832
There are more than 50 of them
in Manhattan.

29:32.834 --> 29:35.167
Roll back the GPS history
on the pickup.

29:35.169 --> 29:36.702
Vaughn might have done
a drive-by

29:36.704 --> 29:38.637
for final preparations
on the job.

29:39.740 --> 29:41.073
They parked for four hours

29:41.075 --> 29:42.208
outside a midtown Bistro.

29:42.210 --> 29:43.759
What's across the street?

29:43.761 --> 29:46.829
Residential high-rise.

29:49.649 --> 29:53.302
An Everhold safe was installed
on the 42nd floor last year.

29:53.304 --> 29:56.138
Client's name is...
Enver Clerik.

29:56.140 --> 29:57.440
I'm sending you the address.

29:59.644 --> 30:01.227
I know that building.

30:01.229 --> 30:03.446
Front security desk is not
gonna let you just walk in.

30:03.448 --> 30:04.697
But I can get you upstairs.

30:04.699 --> 30:06.482
I know a guy who lives
in the building.

30:06.484 --> 30:09.151
Lawyer I untangled
from a malpractice thing.

30:09.153 --> 30:11.287
He's kind of sweet on me.

30:11.289 --> 30:12.788
Finch, any way
to see into that room

30:12.790 --> 30:13.956
before I go in?

30:13.958 --> 30:15.241
Building's website boasts

30:15.243 --> 30:16.892
that all units are equipped

30:16.894 --> 30:18.694
with smarthome technology.

30:18.696 --> 30:20.913
So, yes, I'm sure there's
something we can exploit.

30:20.915 --> 30:23.365
Good. Call Carter,
have her meet us there.

30:46.439 --> 30:49.408
Real nice of your old lady
to let you come out and play.

30:49.410 --> 30:50.626
What do we need guns for?

30:50.628 --> 30:52.194
Oh, didn't I tell you?

30:52.196 --> 30:53.946
We're walking into a hot one.

30:53.948 --> 30:55.831
Guy who lives here
is a gem dealer.

30:55.833 --> 30:57.249
When he's not in town,

30:57.251 --> 30:58.784
his nephew likes
to have people over,

30:58.786 --> 31:01.587
show off the view of the place.

31:01.589 --> 31:04.540
These are for what's called
"crowd control."

31:06.726 --> 31:10.930
I guess you forgot
a mask for me.

31:10.932 --> 31:13.265
I must have miscounted.

31:13.267 --> 31:15.301
Sorry, buddy.

31:15.303 --> 31:17.920
- Honest mistake, I'm sure.
- Let's go, boys.

31:34.271 --> 31:36.872
- Everyone in the corner! Now!
- Let's go!

31:36.874 --> 31:39.642
Cell phones, jewelry,
wallets in the bag now! Come on!

31:39.644 --> 31:41.076
You expecting anyone else
to show up tonight?

31:41.078 --> 31:42.161
No.

31:42.163 --> 31:44.112
Listen, I know what you want.

31:44.114 --> 31:46.382
I don't know the combination.

31:46.384 --> 31:49.451
Nobody asked you!

31:52.756 --> 31:54.790
Bet you never thought
you'd be trying

31:54.792 --> 31:57.793
to get on the other side
of one of these again.

31:57.795 --> 31:59.261
If I'm gonna do this,

31:59.263 --> 32:02.181
it needs to be quiet.

32:02.183 --> 32:03.482
- Hey!
- Aah!

32:03.484 --> 32:05.517
Shut up or get shot!

32:05.519 --> 32:07.770
It's all yours, maestro.

32:24.771 --> 32:26.005
Where are you, Finch?

32:26.007 --> 32:28.040
Already inside, Mr. Reese.

32:28.042 --> 32:30.259
I need to see just how encrypted
their system is,

32:30.261 --> 32:31.827
so give me a moment.

32:34.681 --> 32:37.433
This is one way
of catching them in the act.

32:37.435 --> 32:39.385
Everyone's up
on the 42nd floor.

32:39.387 --> 32:40.936
Soon as I pull Wyler
out of there,

32:40.938 --> 32:42.521
be ready to round up the crew.

32:42.523 --> 32:44.306
You really think
it's gonna be that simple?

32:44.308 --> 32:46.892
Have a little faith.

32:46.894 --> 32:48.694
We haven't had
the pleasure of meeting.

32:48.696 --> 32:50.145
- I'm Detective Carter.
- Zoe.

32:50.147 --> 32:53.032
John's wife.

32:53.034 --> 32:56.068
Long story.

33:03.827 --> 33:05.461
- Rupert.
- Good evening, Miss Morgan.

33:05.463 --> 33:07.362
He's expecting you
and your friend.

33:07.364 --> 33:10.382
I know.
You missed me.

33:10.384 --> 33:13.802
My friend and I are
on our way up.

33:16.257 --> 33:19.842
Who did you say I was?

33:19.844 --> 33:21.376
Savannah.

33:21.378 --> 33:24.263
- An exotic dancer.
- Hmm.

33:33.523 --> 33:35.691
Sorry, Rupert.

33:35.693 --> 33:39.111
Slight change of plans.

33:46.753 --> 33:48.620
How's it coming, Finch?

33:48.622 --> 33:51.357
I'm scanning all the devices
in Mr. Clerik's apartment.

33:51.359 --> 33:55.461
Looks like his television
is equipped with a camera.

33:55.463 --> 33:57.930
If I can access
the video chat software,

33:57.932 --> 33:59.247
I may be able
to trick the camera

33:59.249 --> 34:01.550
into turning itself on.

34:06.139 --> 34:08.389
And we have eyes.

34:08.391 --> 34:10.225
Mr. Reese,
they've got hostages,

34:10.226 --> 34:11.643
and there are
two other armed men.

34:11.645 --> 34:13.161
I don't think
you're gonna be able

34:13.164 --> 34:15.197
to simply walk
through the front door.

34:15.199 --> 34:18.317
Wasn't planning on it.

34:25.859 --> 34:29.610
Go check that out. Now.

35:00.745 --> 35:02.528
I got the numbers.

35:02.530 --> 35:03.579
Now I got to find the order.

35:03.581 --> 35:04.947
How much longer?

35:04.949 --> 35:08.884
As long as it takes.

35:08.886 --> 35:10.786
I'm in, Finch.

35:14.157 --> 35:15.674
Took you long enough!

35:15.676 --> 35:18.627
Forget about it.
We're almost outta here.

35:18.629 --> 35:21.964
Hey!

35:24.552 --> 35:27.453
Relax! Relax!

35:27.455 --> 35:28.470
What is it?

35:28.472 --> 35:29.855
Might be a switch.

35:29.857 --> 35:31.339
Some kind of panic button.

35:31.341 --> 35:32.674
I'm afraid that's correct,
Mr. Reese.

35:32.676 --> 35:34.209
The VOIP is dialing out

35:34.211 --> 35:35.861
to an emergency
broadband network.

35:35.863 --> 35:39.148
Even if I canceled it,
the call's already gone.

35:39.150 --> 35:40.816
Detective, I trust

35:40.818 --> 35:42.084
that you're still monitoring
the police bands?

35:42.086 --> 35:43.735
Yeah, I heard the robbery call.

35:43.737 --> 35:45.537
Only got a few minutes
before they show up.

35:45.539 --> 35:47.406
What's the situation like
upstairs?

35:47.408 --> 35:49.975
Delicate.

35:49.977 --> 35:51.794
If he's alerted the cops,

35:51.796 --> 35:53.162
that's it then,
we're out of here.

35:53.164 --> 35:54.362
Not till you open that safe.

35:54.364 --> 35:55.881
Do you wanna go to jail again?

35:55.883 --> 35:57.082
'Cause that's what's
gonna happen

35:57.084 --> 35:58.366
if we stay here.

35:58.368 --> 35:59.885
When did you start calling
the shots?

35:59.887 --> 36:01.520
All that's changed

36:01.522 --> 36:03.305
is you've got three minutes
to open that safe.

36:03.307 --> 36:05.174
No.

36:07.061 --> 36:09.294
Open it.

36:09.296 --> 36:11.546
Or I kill you right now.

36:26.006 --> 36:27.422
I'm hearing sirens.

36:27.424 --> 36:28.707
Am I gonna have
to arrest John with the crew?

36:28.709 --> 36:30.475
Preferably not.

36:30.477 --> 36:33.545
In the event that the police
arrive before he escapes...

36:33.547 --> 36:35.246
Almost made it a whole day

36:35.248 --> 36:37.465
without you two asking me
to break the law.

36:37.467 --> 36:38.717
I'll see what I can do.

36:38.719 --> 36:40.101
Thank you, Detective.

36:40.103 --> 36:42.804
These guys are getting jumpy,
Harold.

36:42.806 --> 36:44.806
What do you got
in the way of a distraction?

36:44.808 --> 36:46.107
I'm working on it.

36:56.870 --> 36:59.070
Got it.

36:59.072 --> 37:02.073
Man with the midas touch.

37:04.076 --> 37:06.795
I'm holding 20 million worth
of blue garnets in my hand.

37:06.797 --> 37:08.663
I missed you, Lloyd.

37:08.665 --> 37:10.131
Wish I could say the same.

37:10.133 --> 37:13.451
Finch, I think that's your cue.

37:13.453 --> 37:15.887
Sending an audio file
to the surround sound system.

37:15.889 --> 37:18.673
This might get loud.

37:18.675 --> 37:20.508
You ruined my life...

37:20.510 --> 37:22.811
so you could start yourself
a new one.

37:22.813 --> 37:24.262
This'll square it up.

37:32.689 --> 37:34.105
God!

37:38.060 --> 37:39.944
You gonna shoot me?

37:39.946 --> 37:41.613
It's been so long,

37:41.615 --> 37:43.331
you probably don't remember
how that thing works.

37:45.035 --> 37:48.203
You don't want to do that.

37:59.014 --> 38:01.299
Detective Carter,
on-scene commander.

38:01.301 --> 38:03.418
I've been on this crew all week.
Everybody on me.

38:03.420 --> 38:05.220
We're gonna take
the west stairwell up, got it?

38:05.222 --> 38:07.138
Got it.

38:08.140 --> 38:10.058
Let him go, Graham.

38:10.060 --> 38:11.976
I can't.

38:11.978 --> 38:14.345
This has to end.

38:16.031 --> 38:20.235
If you pull that trigger,
then Graham Wyler--

38:20.237 --> 38:22.854
the man you really are--
dies with him.

38:22.856 --> 38:24.906
He can't come after
my family again.

38:24.908 --> 38:26.691
He won't.

38:26.693 --> 38:29.043
He'll spend the next
three decades in prison.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.578
But if you do this,

38:30.580 --> 38:34.299
you'll be right there with him.

38:37.837 --> 38:41.005
What's Connie gonna do then?

38:46.096 --> 38:49.547
I knew you didn't have it
in you.

38:49.549 --> 38:52.734
You were always--

38:52.736 --> 38:55.770
The better man.

38:59.089 --> 39:00.923
_

39:03.162 --> 39:05.029
Come on.

39:05.031 --> 39:06.865
Your exit is clear,
Mr. Reese.

39:06.867 --> 39:10.618
I'm waiting in a car
around the corner.

39:10.620 --> 39:11.786
Keep moving.

39:11.788 --> 39:13.538
There's not much time.

39:13.540 --> 39:14.539
Who are you?

39:14.541 --> 39:17.425
Your ride home.

39:17.427 --> 39:19.210
I left a note
telling her everything.

39:19.212 --> 39:21.346
Who I was, what I'd done.

39:21.348 --> 39:24.299
I'm supposed to go back
like nothing's ever happened?

39:24.301 --> 39:26.050
Connie and Izzy forget

39:26.052 --> 39:27.635
that everything they know
about me is a lie?

39:27.637 --> 39:29.487
Not everything.

39:29.489 --> 39:31.556
What they mean to you,
that's real.

39:31.558 --> 39:32.941
They know that.

39:32.943 --> 39:35.727
Can't change what I've done.

39:35.729 --> 39:38.596
The past is
a difficult thing to outrun.

39:40.816 --> 39:43.401
Maybe it's time
to stop running.

39:43.403 --> 39:48.873
Graham... you don't
have to do this.

39:51.961 --> 39:55.613
Yeah, I do.

39:58.083 --> 40:00.001
Wyler's done hiding, Finch.

40:00.003 --> 40:02.086
He just turned himself in.

40:02.088 --> 40:03.788
He may have decided
to turn himself in,

40:03.790 --> 40:06.341
but you need
to get out of there.

40:12.781 --> 40:15.516
Wyler's turning
state's evidence

40:15.518 --> 40:17.569
in hopes
for a reduced sentence.

40:17.571 --> 40:21.689
I suppose now the courts will
decide what's best for him.

40:23.410 --> 40:25.526
Oh, hi, John.

40:25.528 --> 40:26.861
Connie.

40:26.863 --> 40:28.646
I was wondering
if I could talk to Graham.

40:28.648 --> 40:30.815
He told me you helped him out.

40:30.817 --> 40:32.250
Didn't say how.

40:32.252 --> 40:35.036
But whatever you did...

40:35.038 --> 40:38.373
You're welcome.

40:42.795 --> 40:44.762
See you're moving on.

40:44.764 --> 40:46.180
Yep.

40:46.182 --> 40:48.800
Guy like me doesn't belong
in the suburbs.

40:49.886 --> 40:53.054
Just wanted
to say good-bye.

40:53.056 --> 40:55.790
This is my stop.

40:55.792 --> 40:58.860
Unlike you, I'm stuck here.

40:58.862 --> 41:00.395
Literally.

41:00.397 --> 41:02.981
Judge didn't think
I was a danger to society,

41:02.983 --> 41:06.200
so I get to pay my debt
mowing the lawn.

41:06.202 --> 41:07.986
Graham?

41:07.988 --> 41:09.871
The washer's making
that noise again.

41:09.873 --> 41:13.625
I'll be right there.

41:13.627 --> 41:15.827
I put her through a lot.

41:15.829 --> 41:17.378
And for whatever reason,

41:17.380 --> 41:19.097
she's still there
when I wake up in the morning.

41:19.099 --> 41:21.633
Guess that says something.

41:21.635 --> 41:25.369
Take care, John.

41:45.991 --> 41:50.028
This the part
where we get divorced?

41:50.030 --> 41:52.680
Sorry it didn't work out.

41:52.682 --> 41:54.532
Fun while it lasted though.

41:54.534 --> 41:55.900
Right?

41:55.902 --> 41:57.952
Well, we still have
some scotch left.

41:57.954 --> 41:59.170
Want to stay one more night?

41:59.172 --> 42:00.872
Try to win some
of that money back?

42:24.563 --> 42:27.899

42:31.538 --> 42:34.555

42:43.917 --> 42:44.966
Yes, please.

42:44.968 --> 42:46.084
Even in January,

42:46.086 --> 42:47.335
I always keep a few of these

42:47.337 --> 42:48.503
for when you come by.

42:48.505 --> 42:50.138
Am I really that predictable?

42:50.140 --> 42:52.440
No, you just don't deny
yourself small pleasures.

42:52.442 --> 42:55.292
You may be the first person
that ever told me that.

42:55.294 --> 42:56.427
Nothing wrong with it.

42:56.429 --> 42:58.513
