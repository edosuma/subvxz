A lot of women dream about.

Not gonna say i'm attracted

07:51.038 --> 07:51.670
To you, but, like...

07:51.672 --> 07:52.337
[laughter]

07:52.339 --> 07:53.338
A lot of the girls who come on

07:53.340 --> 07:54.606
Our show are looking at guys

07:54.608 --> 07:55.941
Just like you.

07:55.943 --> 07:56.808
And so it's just interesting

07:56.810 --> 07:58.643
Because here you are now,

07:58.645 --> 08:00.579
In your 30s, looking for love,

08:00.581 --> 08:01.947
And, like, going on the

08:01.949 --> 08:03.215
Internet, where i would think

08:03.217 --> 08:04.182
You wouldn't, you know,

08:04.184 --> 08:05.250
Necessarily need to do that.

08:05.252 --> 08:05.917
>> mm-hmm.

08:05.919 --> 08:06.618
>> so, like, how did you

08:06.620 --> 08:07.352
End up here? Like--

08:07.354 --> 08:08.320
>> it was just more based

08:08.322 --> 08:09.921
On the music, you know, my team

08:09.923 --> 08:10.722
Telling me, "hey, man,

08:10.724 --> 08:12.090
You got to get back more with

08:12.092 --> 08:13.558
The social networking thing.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.392
And you know, as you find

08:14.394 --> 08:15.360
Yourself, you know, having to

08:15.362 --> 08:16.928
Reply and doing things for your

08:16.930 --> 08:18.396
Fans, you find yourself roaming.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.264
You know, you're seeing all

08:19.266 --> 08:20.165
These pretty girls, you're like,

08:20.167 --> 08:21.533
"what--well, hold on for a

08:21.535 --> 08:24.002
Minute, let me see if she hit me

08:24.004 --> 08:25.704
Back," you know what i'm saying?

08:25.706 --> 08:27.472
>> how, like, into this

08:27.474 --> 08:28.273
Relationship that you started

08:28.275 --> 08:30.208
With trinity have you gotten?

08:30.210 --> 08:31.843
>> well, i mean, first of all,

08:31.845 --> 08:32.943
She's beautiful.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.279
On a scale of one to ten

08:34.280 --> 08:36.081
She's, like, a 10,000.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.982
And she's a genuine person.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.217
You know, it's somebody i'm able

08:39.219 --> 08:40.118
To talk to.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.520
She's someone that'll listen,

08:41.522 --> 08:42.453
Just somebody you can share

08:42.456 --> 08:44.422
With, doesn't seem to be, like,

08:44.424 --> 08:45.690
A, you know, moneygrubber,

08:45.692 --> 08:46.858
You know, having to ask me

08:46.860 --> 08:47.592
For anything.

08:47.594 --> 08:48.593
You know, you--soon as you come

08:48.595 --> 08:50.295
Offstage, it might be

08:50.297 --> 08:52.364
5,000 people or 50,000 people,

08:52.366 --> 08:53.798
You still might feel the sense

08:53.800 --> 08:55.400
Of, "i'm still kind of

08:55.402 --> 08:57.936
By myself," and it's hard for

08:57.938 --> 08:59.271
Anyone around you to understand

08:59.273 --> 09:00.272
That, 'cause you know, you have

09:00.274 --> 09:01.706
This money, you have this fame,

09:01.708 --> 09:03.475
And sometimes it's actually

09:03.477 --> 09:04.876
Easier to talk to a stranger

09:04.878 --> 09:05.577
Where i can just kind of

09:05.579 --> 09:06.511
Vent and holler,

09:06.513 --> 09:07.579
You know what i'm saying?

09:07.581 --> 09:08.947
>> and do you find that

09:08.949 --> 09:09.981
Trinity...

09:09.983 --> 09:10.949
>> yeah, yeah, trinity, she--

09:10.951 --> 09:11.850
>> connects with you on that?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.351
>> she's been a awesome person.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.452
She's actually, you know,

09:14.454 --> 09:15.987
Helped me out with things.

09:15.989 --> 09:16.888
I'm currently going through

09:16.890 --> 09:18.757
A police brutality situation

09:18.759 --> 09:20.258
With kentucky state police.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.960
It's still an ongoing case.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.028
It's under appeal.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.162
I got a multimillion-dollar

09:24.164 --> 09:25.764
Lawsuit, it hurt my income,

09:25.766 --> 09:26.431
All kind of stuff.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.666
I had two record deals.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.733
Everybody stopped messing

09:28.735 --> 09:29.534
With me.

09:29.536 --> 09:30.969
Trinity, she's actually,

09:30.971 --> 09:31.870
You know, helped me out

09:31.872 --> 09:32.737
With some campaigns i'm trying

09:32.739 --> 09:34.439
To start, like the gofundme

09:34.441 --> 09:36.041
To help other people who've been

09:36.043 --> 09:38.176
A victim of police brutality.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.210
So she kind of just jumped

09:39.212 --> 09:40.312
In there, like, "hey, whatever

09:40.314 --> 09:41.346
You need, you know, whatever

09:41.348 --> 09:42.948
Knowledge or resources i got,

09:42.950 --> 09:43.882
I'm with you, you know,

09:43.884 --> 09:44.616
Just holler at me."

09:44.618 --> 09:45.784
>> so do you think that trinity

09:45.786 --> 09:48.787
Could maybe be someone you could

09:48.789 --> 09:49.988
Start a future with?

09:49.990 --> 09:50.722
>> you know, my mother and

09:50.724 --> 09:52.724
Father's been married 44 years,

09:52.726 --> 09:53.592
So you know, i hope

09:53.594 --> 09:54.593
To have a relationship,

09:54.595 --> 09:55.660
Something like that.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.195
I'd like to, you know, be able

09:57.197 --> 09:58.496
To have a family.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.498
Trinity definitely could be

10:00.500 --> 10:01.366
The one.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.033
>> sean?

10:02.035 --> 10:02.701
>> yeah.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.468
>> you guys have been pretty

10:03.470 --> 10:04.269
Good friends now for a while.

10:04.271 --> 10:04.736
>> yeah.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.571
>> what's your sort of take

10:06.573 --> 10:07.372
On all this?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.240
>> she got an effect on him.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.343
You know, she has to, 'cause

10:11.345 --> 10:12.410
He's hard to get to.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.578
I'd say he loves her, he can

10:13.580 --> 10:14.579
Open up to her.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.947
He speaks about her a lot,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.148
Smiling when he speaks.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.316
>> [chuckles]

10:18.318 --> 10:19.417
>> are you afraid that maybe

10:19.419 --> 10:21.486
He's too into her and that she

10:21.488 --> 10:22.721
Might not turn out to be--

10:22.723 --> 10:23.788
>> yeah.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.456
>> yeah?

10:24.458 --> 10:25.123
>> yeah.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.057
Little too good to be true

10:26.059 --> 10:26.992
To me.

10:26.994 --> 10:27.959
I don't know, might be,

10:27.961 --> 10:29.995
Might be, but we gonna see.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.162
>> do you have pictures of her?

10:31.164 --> 10:31.863
>> yeah, i got a couple

10:31.865 --> 10:33.264
Pictures.

10:33.266 --> 10:33.932
>> so here's one.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.966

I mean, yes.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.109
>> is she--is that her?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.010
>> yeah, she working out.

10:45.012 --> 10:45.877
>> yeah, that's more of, like,

10:45.879 --> 10:46.444
A regular--

10:46.446 --> 10:47.178
>> she's still pretty

10:47.180 --> 10:47.879
In the regular pictures.

10:47.881 --> 10:48.680
>> yeah.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.215
How often do you guys text?

10:50.217 --> 10:52.317
>> often, you know, kind of

10:52.319 --> 10:53.418
Daily.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.319
>> she said, "dang, you got

10:54.321 --> 10:55.587
A lot going on now."

10:55.589 --> 10:57.288
You said, "my manager started

10:57.290 --> 10:58.423
New instagram and people have

10:58.425 --> 10:59.424
Been coming out of the woodwork

10:59.426 --> 11:00.625
Like they been looking for me."

11:00.627 --> 11:01.660
She said, "that's good, though.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.627
That's why it's good to start

11:02.629 --> 11:03.628
Fresh sometimes."

11:03.630 --> 11:04.663
>> yeah, yeah.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.398
>> "you still busy with your

11:06.400 --> 11:07.799

11:09.436 --> 11:10.235

11:11.038 --> 11:12.504
>> yeah, she cares.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.238
>> all right, so look, all

11:13.240 --> 11:15.073
Right, so the next step for us

11:15.075 --> 11:17.175
Is to sort of apply

11:17.177 --> 11:19.310
Our investigation skills,

11:19.312 --> 11:21.413
So you send us an email with

11:21.415 --> 11:22.480
Everything that you've got,

11:22.482 --> 11:24.049
The pictures, phone number,

11:24.051 --> 11:24.883
Whatever you have, facebook

11:24.885 --> 11:26.051
Page, all that.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.786
We'll go through it all,

11:27.788 --> 11:28.920
And then we'll check back in

11:28.922 --> 11:30.555
With you and let you know

11:30.557 --> 11:31.890
What we find.

11:31.892 --> 11:32.991
>> man, i appreciate you,

11:32.993 --> 11:33.692
Brothers.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.361
Bring back some good news.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.563
>> well, those guys are great.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.198
You know, what's crazy is, like,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.266
From the other side of this

11:41.268 --> 11:42.033
Story, he's the catfish.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.268
>> he's the catfish.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.370
She must be thinking that he's

11:45.372 --> 11:46.271
A catfish, and she's like,

11:46.273 --> 11:47.105
"well, he's lying about

11:47.107 --> 11:48.773
Who he is, so, like, i told him

11:48.775 --> 11:50.208
I was a supermodel."

11:50.210 --> 11:53.378
If he was any other guy,

11:53.380 --> 11:54.713
We'd be totally sure that

11:54.715 --> 11:56.614
That was a catfish, but because

11:56.616 --> 11:58.650
He is who he is, there's

11:58.652 --> 12:00.285
A good chance that this is

12:00.287 --> 12:02.153
A girl who would be into him.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.722
>> man, and i hate to say it,

12:03.724 --> 12:05.423
But, like, my gut is

12:05.425 --> 12:07.492
It's a catfish.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.732
>> all right, max, so here's

12:13.734 --> 12:14.466
What we got.

12:14.468 --> 12:15.366
>> we got two clementines.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.634
>> [laughs]

12:16.636 --> 12:17.302

12:17.304 --> 12:17.969
>> trinity.

12:17.971 --> 12:18.703
>> trinity.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.205
And then here's us.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.539
>> so we have no laptop today,

12:21.541 --> 12:22.273
It's just--

12:22.275 --> 12:23.108
>> [laughs] it's just

12:23.110 --> 12:24.509
Tangerines.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.710
All right, let's just start.

12:25.712 --> 12:26.811
Ready, max?

12:26.813 --> 12:29.414
>> yeah. Recap, and go.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.082
>> we've got a man who's very

12:31.084 --> 12:32.584
Serious about settling down

12:32.586 --> 12:33.618
And looking for love.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.920
Prophet is a multi-platinum,

12:35.922 --> 12:37.188
Grammy nominated

12:37.190 --> 12:38.656
Recording artist, formerly

12:38.658 --> 12:40.792
Of the rap group nappy roots.

12:40.794 --> 12:41.993
Prophet's in a little bit of

12:41.995 --> 12:43.495
A slump right now as a result

12:43.497 --> 12:44.763
Of leaving the group and also

12:44.765 --> 12:46.598
Having a really rough two years

12:46.600 --> 12:48.399
Dealing with a messed up

12:48.401 --> 12:49.868
Police brutality situation.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.969
He's trying to reconnect with

12:50.971 --> 12:52.203
New fans, let 'em know what's

12:52.205 --> 12:53.271
Going on in his life, so he

12:53.273 --> 12:54.839
Starts reaching out to people.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.574
He's new to social media.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.709
He messages this girl that he

12:57.711 --> 12:59.210
Sees on his facebook

12:59.212 --> 13:00.145
"people you may know."

13:00.147 --> 13:01.045
>> trinity harrison.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.480
>> they start talking, he starts

13:02.482 --> 13:04.215
To develop feelings for her.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.350
His friends start telling him,

13:05.352 --> 13:06.151
Like, "how do you know

13:06.153 --> 13:06.818
She's real?

13:06.820 --> 13:07.719
You haven't met her yet."

13:07.721 --> 13:09.053
>> seems to good to be true.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.389
>> and that's why we're here.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.423
All right.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.658
We've got her facebook page,

13:13.660 --> 13:15.860
Her phone number, and her email.

13:15.862 --> 13:16.661
Let's just start with her

13:16.663 --> 13:17.228
Facebook.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.563
>> she's a beauty.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.298
She has 1,600 friends.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.065
>> which is a normal amount.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.000
>> yeah, that's--that's norms.

13:22.002 --> 13:22.801
>> that's norms.

>> professional skills,

13:25.272 --> 13:26.638
Modeling.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.405
>> all right, let's look

13:27.407 --> 13:28.173
At her profile pictures.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.674
She just posted the other day,

13:29.676 --> 13:31.442
"happy derby day."

13:31.444 --> 13:32.443
>> there's nothing, like,

13:32.445 --> 13:34.846
Particularly "derby"

13:34.848 --> 13:36.614
About that picture.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.349
Look at who's posting here.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.517
All dudes.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.251
>> mostly guys.

13:40.253 --> 13:40.919
>> it's all guys.

13:40.921 --> 13:41.719
>> well, there's also no

13:41.721 --> 13:42.487
Pictures of her with anybody

13:42.489 --> 13:42.954
Else.

13:42.956 --> 13:43.922
>> right, no one's tagged,

13:43.924 --> 13:45.323
There are no friends.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.825
This is guy bait.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.927
>> let's do...

13:48.929 --> 13:50.094
A little image search.

13:50.096 --> 13:50.895
>> well, this is gonna be

13:50.897 --> 13:51.563
The thing.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.064
First pic.

13:53.066 --> 13:53.865
Blam!

13:53.867 --> 13:54.833

13:58.205 --> 13:59.304
>> she's on instagram

13:59.306 --> 14:00.238
In a big way.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.472
She's got almost a million

14:01.474 --> 14:02.240
Followers, which is

14:02.242 --> 14:03.208
Pretty legit.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.709
>> there's the picture that they

14:04.711 --> 14:05.543
Stole for the kentucky "derbs."

14:05.545 --> 14:08.012
>> oh, yeah, there it is.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.247
>> she's everywhere.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.849
She's a supermodel.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.617
Wait, this girl is chris brown's

14:12.619 --> 14:13.718
Ex-girlfriend.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.386
So she dated chris brown.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.321
>> it looks like we found

14:16.323 --> 14:17.055
The girl in the pictures.

14:17.057 --> 14:17.722
>> we definitely found

14:17.724 --> 14:18.756
The real trinity.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.558
>> whoever prophet's talking to

14:20.560 --> 14:21.693
Is taking pictures off of her

14:21.695 --> 14:23.761
Instagram.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.430
This is, like,

14:25.432 --> 14:27.432
Basic catfish stuff.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.067
>> it was very easy to find,

14:29.069 --> 14:30.768
Wasn't a complicated ruse.

14:30.770 --> 14:31.870
>> right.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.338
>> we know, seeing that right

14:33.340 --> 14:34.772
Away, that he didn't know that.

14:34.774 --> 14:35.673
>> he didn't know.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.643
Let's send jasmine, the real

14:38.645 --> 14:39.644
Girl in the pictures, a message,

14:39.646 --> 14:42.013
Because maybe she knows about

14:42.015 --> 14:42.780
This girl trinity.

14:42.782 --> 14:43.514
We're gonna send her

14:43.516 --> 14:45.283
A video message.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.685
Hello, jasmine, it's nev and max

14:47.687 --> 14:49.721
From <i> catfish</i> on mtv, and we're

14:49.723 --> 14:50.855
Making an episode right now.

14:50.857 --> 14:51.956
We would really like to talk

14:51.958 --> 14:53.591
To you, because your pictures

14:53.593 --> 14:54.826
Are all up in it.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.027
Hit me back.

14:56.029 --> 14:56.995
>> you just wanted to say,

14:56.997 --> 14:58.263
"all up in it."

14:58.265 --> 15:00.331
This person has been stealing

15:00.333 --> 15:02.133
Pictures of a famous model.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.501
>> so if it's not

15:03.503 --> 15:06.471
Trinity harrison, who is it?

15:06.473 --> 15:11.342
Let's search the phone number.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.076
>> all right, who we got?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.011
What do we got? What we got?

15:13.013 --> 15:13.778
>> both: Oh!

15:13.780 --> 15:14.879
>> we got a name.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.781
>> crystal [bleep].

15:16.783 --> 15:18.683
>> and we got an address.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.451
This looks pretty legit.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.185
>> hold on, let's look

15:21.187 --> 15:21.853
At the address.

15:21.855 --> 15:22.687
>> we got an address and a name.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.188
This is a real hit.

15:24.190 --> 15:24.989
>> where's crestwood

15:24.991 --> 15:27.292
In comparison to louisville?

15:27.294 --> 15:29.560
>> it's, like, north--northeast

15:29.562 --> 15:30.595
Of louisville.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.930
Wow.

15:31.932 --> 15:32.931
About 15, 20 minutes.

15:32.933 --> 15:33.932
If that's where this girl lives,

15:33.934 --> 15:34.832
She's not far.

15:34.834 --> 15:35.500
>> right.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.234
>> she's close.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.435
All right, let's go to facebook

15:37.437 --> 15:38.102
And do a search

15:38.104 --> 15:39.270
For crystal [bleep].

15:39.272 --> 15:39.971
>> all right.

15:39.973 --> 15:40.638
>> oh, here we go.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.439
>> there you go.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.507
Bunch of "crystal [bleep]s"

15:42.509 --> 15:43.841
In kentucky.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.243
>> it's a pretty common name.

15:45.245 --> 15:45.910
Should we keep looking

15:45.912 --> 15:46.577
At other ones?

15:46.579 --> 15:47.245
Let's see.

15:47.247 --> 15:47.946
>> kentucky university.

15:47.948 --> 15:48.613
>> this woman's in

15:48.615 --> 15:49.247
A relationship.

15:49.249 --> 15:49.914
>> he could be talking

15:49.916 --> 15:50.581
To anyone.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.482
>> we don't know who this person

15:51.484 --> 15:52.884
Is for sure, but it's probably

15:52.886 --> 15:54.519
Someone named crystal, and she's

15:54.521 --> 15:55.320
Not the girl in the pictures,

15:55.322 --> 15:56.921
Which is pretty major.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.923
Prophet is such a sweet guy

15:58.925 --> 16:00.491
And he wants to be happy.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.659
He went to the internet finally

16:01.661 --> 16:03.261
And started to connect with fans

16:03.263 --> 16:04.529
And just sort of happened upon

16:04.531 --> 16:06.698
This beautiful, sweet, genuine

16:06.700 --> 16:09.500
Person, but he doesn't know

16:09.502 --> 16:11.402
That that doesn't really happen.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.670
>> but he has been talking

16:12.672 --> 16:13.705
To someone.

16:13.707 --> 16:14.906
That someone has been

16:14.908 --> 16:16.941
Supportive and awesome.

16:16.943 --> 16:17.909
They might not look like

16:17.911 --> 16:19.744
That girl, but almost no one

16:19.746 --> 16:21.245
Looks like that girl, and

16:21.247 --> 16:23.748
She could turn out to be someone

16:23.750 --> 16:24.916
He might be interested in.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.384
>> let's wait to hear back

16:26.386 --> 16:28.786
From jasmine, see if she knows

16:28.788 --> 16:30.488
Anything, and then go talk to

16:30.490 --> 16:32.523
Prophet, show him what we found.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.392
We gotta ease him into this.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.027
>> his heart could break.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.000
>> all right, let me check.

16:42.002 --> 16:42.667
>> all right, you got

16:42.669 --> 16:43.334
An instant message.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.168
>> i got an an instant message.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.069
That's not what it's called

16:45.071 --> 16:45.737
Anymore, max, that was

16:45.739 --> 16:46.371
15 years ago, but--

16:46.373 --> 16:47.238
>> a direct message.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.107
>> it's a response to our video.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.274
"hi. Feel free to give me

16:50.276 --> 16:50.975
A call.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.477
You can reach me on my cell."

16:52.479 --> 16:54.312
Or on skype.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.947
>> all right, here we go.

16:55.949 --> 16:58.116
[phone line trills]

16:58.118 --> 16:58.916
Good morning.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.051
>> hey.

17:00.053 --> 17:00.718
Hi.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.786
>> [laughs]

17:02.755 --> 17:03.654
>> we are here, making

17:03.656 --> 17:05.022
An episode of <i> catfish.</i>

17:05.025 --> 17:07.558
We were called by a gentleman

17:07.560 --> 17:09.727
Who believes that he has been

17:09.729 --> 17:13.464
Talking to a woman who looks

17:13.465 --> 17:15.098
A lot like you, using the name

17:15.101 --> 17:16.401
Trinity harrison.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.435
Ever heard someone using

17:17.436 --> 17:18.970
That name?

17:18.972 --> 17:20.038
Well, what makes this

17:20.040 --> 17:22.373
Particular story extra

17:22.375 --> 17:24.342
Interesting is that the guy who

17:24.344 --> 17:26.411
Thinks he's been talking to you

17:26.413 --> 17:28.378
Is a pretty well known,

17:28.381 --> 17:30.882
Successful rapper.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.918
>> this guy prophet

17:33.920 --> 17:35.186
From the nappy roots.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.290
>> we're firstly curious to know

17:39.292 --> 17:40.591
If there's some sort of

17:40.593 --> 17:42.193
Notorious person that you happen

17:42.195 --> 17:44.962
To know about who often takes

17:44.964 --> 17:46.164
Your pictures.

18:02.714 --> 18:03.915
>> all right, well, thank you.

18:03.917 --> 18:04.982
>> bye.

18:06.885 --> 18:07.819
>> we got a lot of stuff we

18:07.821 --> 18:09.587
Gotta go over now with prophet.

18:10.656 --> 18:11.756
>> yo, it's nev.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.557
We want to give you the update

18:12.559 --> 18:13.758
On some information

18:13.760 --> 18:14.826
That we found.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.063
>> yeah, that would be awesome.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.031
All right, later.

18:20.033 --> 18:20.832
Prophet's gonna be pretty

18:20.834 --> 18:21.432
Bummed.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.400
But, like, at the same time,

18:22.402 --> 18:24.235
He has made what sounds like

18:24.237 --> 18:25.470
A pretty unique connection with

18:25.472 --> 18:27.438
This person, so the question is,

18:27.440 --> 18:28.272
Do you think he'll say,

18:28.274 --> 18:29.207
"all right, look, i want to meet

18:29.209 --> 18:31.309
Her whoever she is, because we

18:31.311 --> 18:32.143
Have something real," or do you

18:32.145 --> 18:32.944
Think he'll just be like,

18:32.946 --> 18:33.811
"i don't have time for this,

18:33.813 --> 18:34.612
She's been lying to me and

18:34.614 --> 18:35.513
She's not the person i think she

18:35.515 --> 18:37.415
Is, like, i'm gonna move on"?

18:37.417 --> 18:38.583
>> until he meets the person

18:38.585 --> 18:39.317
Face-to-face, though,

18:39.319 --> 18:41.052
It won't truly be real.

18:41.054 --> 18:43.321
>> right.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.523
>> the muhammad ali center.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.092
This place is amazing looking.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.527
>> [sighs] all right.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.428
Oh.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.896
>> what up? What up? What up?

18:51.898 --> 18:53.164
Muhammad ali center.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.298
Anybody who comes to louisville,

18:54.300 --> 18:56.300
Kentucky, gotta come here.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.034
So y'all find out

18:57.036 --> 18:58.970
Some information for me?

18:58.972 --> 19:00.171
>> yeah, man, we got

19:00.173 --> 19:01.939
Some updates for sure.

19:01.941 --> 19:02.874
>> let's do it.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.075
>> let's have a seat.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.776
>> [sighs]

19:05.778 --> 19:07.645
>> anxiously waiting.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.013
>> so, naturally, the first

19:09.015 --> 19:11.048
Thing that we did was we went to

29:41.013 --> 29:42.045
Whatever you said, i had

29:42.047 --> 29:43.814
A picture that would match that.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.382
>> that's some good work.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.485
You a damn magician.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.386
>> what was the need

29:49.388 --> 29:50.254
For the page to begin with?

29:50.256 --> 29:51.789
>> the need to begin with was

29:51.791 --> 29:53.290
My then boyfriend in january

29:53.292 --> 29:54.925
Had created a facebook page,

29:54.927 --> 29:57.227
And there were pictures and

29:57.229 --> 29:59.296
Stuff where it may say there

29:59.298 --> 30:00.497
Were five comments and i could

30:00.499 --> 30:01.965
Only see three, so obviously,

30:01.967 --> 30:03.901
Someone had me blocked,

30:03.903 --> 30:05.736
So that's why i created

30:05.738 --> 30:06.904
The fake page.

30:06.906 --> 30:07.838
>> oh.

30:07.840 --> 30:08.872
So you were dating someone.

30:08.874 --> 30:09.606
>> uh-huh.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.042
>> and had a feeling that they

30:12.044 --> 30:13.677
Were talking to someone

30:13.679 --> 30:15.012
Through their facebook page...

30:15.014 --> 30:16.013
>> mm-hmm.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.014
>> that you couldn't see?

30:17.016 --> 30:17.681
>> right.

30:17.683 --> 30:18.482
>> why didn't you ever

30:18.484 --> 30:21.018
Just tell prophet?

30:21.020 --> 30:22.085
>> there were several times

30:22.087 --> 30:24.421
That i wanted to, but i felt

30:24.423 --> 30:26.523
That he needed the motivation

30:26.525 --> 30:29.126
With his case and his career,

30:29.128 --> 30:30.260
And i felt that trinity was

30:30.262 --> 30:31.995
The one that would motivate him.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.497
>> hmm.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.399
>> don't you think telling him

30:35.401 --> 30:36.700
What the situation really was

30:36.702 --> 30:38.402
Would be the most helpful

30:38.404 --> 30:39.603
And supportive thing?

30:39.605 --> 30:40.871
>> well, i felt that i should

30:40.873 --> 30:42.372
Just keep it going,

30:42.374 --> 30:43.941
Just to continue to be there

30:43.943 --> 30:48.712
To talk to him, listen to him.

30:48.714 --> 30:49.880
>> did you develop

30:49.882 --> 30:51.515
Romantic feelings for him?

30:51.517 --> 30:52.516
>> i did.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.717
Some of those conversations

30:53.719 --> 30:55.219
At 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning

30:55.221 --> 30:57.221
Were more than just helping him.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.856
>> this is probably the most

30:58.858 --> 30:59.890
Embarrassed i probably ever

30:59.892 --> 31:01.024
Been in my life.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.693
Everything i said to you has

31:02.695 --> 31:04.428
Been honest, you know, honest

31:04.430 --> 31:08.031
Feelings, honest thoughts,

31:08.033 --> 31:09.533
Honest intentions.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.202
You violated my trust.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.437
I've shared all these different

31:13.439 --> 31:15.105
Things with you, let you into my

31:15.107 --> 31:17.040
Life, let you know about things

31:17.042 --> 31:18.141

31:18.143 --> 31:20.010
Close to me don't know about.

31:20.012 --> 31:20.844
That's kind of what's

31:20.846 --> 31:22.246
Disappointing throughout this

31:22.248 --> 31:23.313
Whole thing, is like, you know,

31:23.315 --> 31:25.682
I actually got involved.

31:25.684 --> 31:26.650
I don't even know what to say

31:26.652 --> 31:27.784
Anymore.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.820
I don't know what to tell you.

31:29.822 --> 31:31.755
>> i mean, that's totally to be

31:31.757 --> 31:33.657
Expected.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.792
Everything that i responded back

31:35.794 --> 31:37.694
To you, talked to you about,

31:37.696 --> 31:38.929
That was coming from me,

31:38.931 --> 31:40.998
Crystal.

31:44.035 --> 31:46.169
>> you seem to be a person that

31:46.171 --> 31:48.538
Has a lot to offer someone.

31:48.540 --> 31:52.075
Obviously, it's not me.

31:52.077 --> 31:55.178
Nice to meet you, crystal.

32:04.622 --> 32:05.722
>> prophet now needs a little

32:05.724 --> 32:08.258
Time, 'cause this is a very new

32:08.260 --> 32:10.294
Experience for him in many ways,

32:10.296 --> 32:12.029
Just to sort of wrap his mind

32:12.031 --> 32:13.063
Around all this and figure out

32:13.065 --> 32:13.797
How he feels.

32:13.799 --> 32:14.464
What would be great is

32:14.466 --> 32:16.266
To meet back up with you

32:16.268 --> 32:17.167
After we've had a chance

32:17.169 --> 32:19.603
To kind of figure all that out.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.504
And then we'll have a chance to

32:20.506 --> 32:24.441
Sort of sort out his feelings.

we should do.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.134
We should do.

32:51.135 --> 32:51.767
Prophet's got his career on

32:51.770 --> 32:53.003
The line he's got to jump start.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.004
He's got to figure out what he's

32:54.006 --> 32:55.472
Doing with his life, so if we

32:55.474 --> 32:56.974
Don't find some kind of

Can move on with their lives,

33:01.246 --> 33:02.946
We won't have done our job.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.318
And the call dropped.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.085
>> he's sort of cheating

40:56.087 --> 40:56.653
On his wife.

40:56.655 --> 40:57.987
>> he is cheating.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.189
>> there's no turning back now.

40:59.191 --> 40:59.856
[knocking at the door]

40:59.858 --> 41:00.523
>> hello?

41:00.525 --> 41:01.191
[dog barking]

41:01.193 --> 41:01.891
>> someone's home.

41:01.893 --> 41:02.959
Someone's home.
