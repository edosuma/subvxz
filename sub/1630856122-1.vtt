WEBVTT

00:37.631 --> 00:38.865
Alice!

00:42.402 --> 00:43.737
Alice!

00:47.507 --> 00:50.543
Alice. Oh, God, there you are.

00:50.610 --> 00:52.445
Are you all right? Huh?

00:52.512 --> 00:53.480
What happened?

00:53.546 --> 00:55.081
Jakey Snyder came a calling,

00:55.148 --> 00:57.917
on account of that debt he says you owe him

00:57.984 --> 01:01.054
for the rustling job in Colorado last spring.

01:01.121 --> 01:04.124
I don’t owe him a goddamn dime.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.826
Well, it don’t matter, because he says he’s going

01:06.893 --> 01:09.763
to burn down this house with us in it.

01:09.829 --> 01:13.333
Our boy stopped him, and he went and said

01:13.400 --> 01:16.936
he’d wrangle the money and get it to Jakey tomorrow.

01:17.003 --> 01:19.305
I tried to stop him, Mike,

01:19.372 --> 01:21.908
But you know, our boy is getting to the age

01:21.975 --> 01:24.310
where he thinks he can handle things by himself.

01:24.377 --> 01:28.782
Yeah, and he’s stubborn, too, just like you.

01:28.848 --> 01:30.950
Where’d you say he was going?

01:31.017 --> 01:32.352
The bank in Sweetwater.

01:33.420 --> 01:34.854
Oh...

01:36.489 --> 01:39.025
I’ll handle that. I’ll take care of this.

01:39.092 --> 01:42.862
If that little prick comes back here, you know how to use it.

01:42.929 --> 01:44.631
Lock the doors.

01:44.698 --> 01:48.234
You bring our boy back safe.

01:49.569 --> 01:50.737
I will.

01:52.405 --> 01:55.341
Madame, you got my word.

02:26.206 --> 02:29.008
Put that goddamn thing away.

02:29.075 --> 02:30.944
What are you doing, Robert?

02:31.010 --> 02:32.178
Jakey Snyder said he’s going to kill us

02:32.245 --> 02:33.713
if we don’t settler your debt.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.583
Jakey Snyder’s full of shit, and you know that.

02:36.649 --> 02:40.253
We got no other choice, Mike.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.057
I did not ask you to do this.

02:44.124 --> 02:47.227
The fact that you drag your little friend in there

02:47.293 --> 02:49.195
-into our business? -Yeah.

02:49.262 --> 02:52.499
I can take care of Jakey Snyder, believe me.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.402
If you’d done any kind of preparation

02:56.469 --> 02:58.938
or homework on this goddamn thing,

02:59.005 --> 03:01.074
you would understand that that bank

03:01.141 --> 03:04.878
has been robbed seven times in the last six months.

03:04.944 --> 03:06.279
They brought Pinkertons in.

03:06.346 --> 03:08.248
They brought railroad detectives in.

03:08.314 --> 03:11.117
Every other man on the street is some kind of lawman

03:11.184 --> 03:13.987
waiting for one thing: for someone to cross the line.

03:14.053 --> 03:16.022
-I don’t really care. -Oh, really?

03:16.089 --> 03:17.524
This isn’t cattle rustling.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.025
This isn’t grifting.

03:19.092 --> 03:22.128
This isn’t all that petty little bullshit.

03:22.195 --> 03:25.732
You rob a bank and you’re done.

03:25.799 --> 03:29.536
Your picture is going to be on every goddamn poster

03:29.602 --> 03:32.138
from here to Fort Worth.

03:32.205 --> 03:34.340
-I don’t-- -Hear me.

03:34.407 --> 03:37.443
Lost time is never found again.

03:39.846 --> 03:41.247
Get your hands off me, old man.

03:41.314 --> 03:44.617
Oh, sure, go ahead and kill yourself.

03:44.684 --> 03:46.553
You’re making a mistake.

03:47.921 --> 03:49.589
You’re gonna regret it.

04:06.072 --> 04:08.341
-All right, nobody move! -Jesus Christ.

04:16.282 --> 04:17.717
Chaz.

04:17.784 --> 04:19.419
You wait till they come out.

04:21.054 --> 04:23.556
Hurry up, you’ve got 30 seconds.

04:26.659 --> 04:28.595
No, please!

04:28.661 --> 04:31.097
Mister, get out of my way.

04:31.164 --> 04:32.632
Otherwise, I’m going to assume

04:32.699 --> 04:35.468
you’re a member of this gang and treat you as such.

04:35.535 --> 04:39.138
No, please. One of those kids in there is my son.

04:39.205 --> 04:43.476
Give me a chance to just talk to him.

04:43.543 --> 04:44.644
Do you understand?

04:44.711 --> 04:46.546
Please.

04:46.613 --> 04:50.283
Everybody deserves a second chance, for Christ’s sake,

04:51.751 --> 04:53.386
Not him.

04:57.223 --> 05:00.393
[women screaming]

05:00.460 --> 05:02.595
Detective Schumacher, move up!

05:05.632 --> 05:06.633
[groans]

05:11.771 --> 05:15.074
Throw your guns out and come out with your hands up.

05:15.141 --> 05:17.010
And I promise you,

05:17.076 --> 05:20.280
your punishment will be just and appropriate.

05:20.346 --> 05:21.748
If you go against me,

05:21.814 --> 05:25.618
it will be a death sentence for the both of you.

05:31.624 --> 05:32.725
Run!

05:32.792 --> 05:34.727
Dolly! I dropped Dolly!

05:39.465 --> 05:40.900
[grunts]

05:40.967 --> 05:44.404
Son, you’re all alone now. The law’s all around you.

05:44.470 --> 05:45.705
[gunfire]

06:02.522 --> 06:04.190
Jolena!

06:10.663 --> 06:11.998
[woman screams]

06:12.065 --> 06:14.600
Oh, God no! My baby!

06:33.486 --> 06:36.422
You want to end up like your friend or that old man

06:36.489 --> 06:38.558
who got in my way bleeding out in the street?

06:40.393 --> 06:43.463
Or that little girl who got caught in the crossfire?

06:43.529 --> 06:44.697
Please, no!

06:44.764 --> 06:46.232
Let’s make this easy!

06:47.900 --> 06:49.802
[panting]

06:54.941 --> 06:56.542
[gunshot]

06:58.611 --> 07:00.413
[gunfire]

07:01.547 --> 07:02.682
[groans]

07:08.454 --> 07:11.024
[grunts]

07:11.090 --> 07:12.959
Who was that with you?

07:13.026 --> 07:14.560
No one.

07:16.629 --> 07:17.663
Name.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.565
Butch.

07:19.632 --> 07:22.168
Last name.

07:23.770 --> 07:24.704
Cassidy.

09:33.399 --> 09:34.800
Good afternoon.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.936
I understand you have a safe aboard this train.

09:40.306 --> 09:42.475
Yeah. We do.

09:54.453 --> 09:55.688
It’s in the mail car.

10:53.145 --> 10:54.614
[chuckles]

11:00.253 --> 11:01.520
Ha!

11:01.587 --> 11:03.556
That was one hell of a rehearsal.

11:03.623 --> 11:05.858
-What do you think, Butch? -Good.

11:05.925 --> 11:08.227
Except that last part where you ran up like an idiot

11:08.294 --> 11:09.562
and said my name, Bob.

11:09.629 --> 11:11.530
Yeah, yeah. Sorry about that.

11:11.597 --> 11:14.033
Questions? Everybody knows their job?

11:14.100 --> 11:15.334
You bet, Butch.

11:15.401 --> 11:16.769
Good.

11:16.836 --> 11:19.772
You do have a conductor uniform, don’t you?

11:19.839 --> 11:21.440
Of course I do.

11:21.507 --> 11:22.808
All right.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.710
Last thing we do before we ride out is

11:24.777 --> 11:27.913
Isom goes and cuts the telegraph wires at the ticket office.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.249
Ben, Laura, this being your first job with us,

11:30.316 --> 11:31.584
on account of being down a man

11:31.651 --> 11:34.120
with Will Carver still locked up,

11:34.186 --> 11:35.154
we’re only here for the loot.

11:35.221 --> 11:37.189
Not to kill nobody.

11:37.256 --> 11:39.925
You’re only going to use your guns if the plan goes to hell.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.761
But no shooting.

11:41.827 --> 11:42.995
-Understood? -Got it, Butch.

11:43.062 --> 11:44.830
Understood.

11:49.935 --> 11:52.271
Half for today and half for tomorrow.

11:52.338 --> 11:54.707
Thank you, Butch.

11:54.774 --> 11:56.809
See y’all tomorrow at the Northern Pacific Rail.

11:59.078 --> 12:02.114
Didn’t he say the Southern Pacific rail the other day?

12:02.181 --> 12:05.751
Yeah, yeah, he did say that.

12:05.818 --> 12:07.353
He’s your boy, Elzy.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.622
I mean Northern, Southern, I don’t think it matters too much

12:09.689 --> 12:11.724
as long as train comes in 9:00 A.M., right?

12:11.791 --> 12:13.693
As long as he’s on it.

12:13.759 --> 12:15.695
I mean, he wants the second half of his money.

12:15.761 --> 12:17.063
He don’t want to be looking over his shoulder

12:17.129 --> 12:18.664
the rest of his life.

12:18.731 --> 12:20.966
There won’t be much life left if he doesn’t show up.

12:25.204 --> 12:26.839
We better get out of here.

12:26.906 --> 12:28.374
Got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

12:42.788 --> 12:43.889
[neighs]

12:55.868 --> 12:58.671
All right, boy. We’re going.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.332
Train’s early.

13:26.399 --> 13:28.033
Gonna have to catch up to it.

13:30.336 --> 13:32.438
Let’s get it. Hyah!

13:37.309 --> 13:38.778
[train whistle blows]

14:07.606 --> 14:10.075
[train whistle blows]

14:29.862 --> 14:31.530
Let me help you with that, Ma’am.

14:35.301 --> 14:38.437
You sure it’s wise to team up with these kids?

14:38.504 --> 14:39.872
They’re a bit soft for my taste.

14:39.939 --> 14:40.873
Uh-huh.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.609
Butch Cassidy.

14:43.676 --> 14:46.445
Breaking all them young hearts.

14:46.512 --> 14:47.980
Butch Cassidy is a good scout

14:48.047 --> 14:50.716
when it comes to robbing banks and trains.

14:50.783 --> 14:52.785
Always has a solid plan, always gets the loot.

14:52.852 --> 14:55.621
Nothing ever goes wrong. There’s nothing to worry about.

14:55.688 --> 14:57.323
I’m reckon that’s all true.

14:57.389 --> 15:00.593
I just don’t see why he’s so against killing someone.

15:00.659 --> 15:02.728
To each his own, Ben.

15:04.163 --> 15:05.931
As long as Butch can hold his own.

15:05.998 --> 15:07.733
if it comes to a gunfight.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.001
That’s my girl.

15:10.636 --> 15:11.804
You two knock it off.

15:11.871 --> 15:13.138
-[train whistle blows] -All aboard!

15:16.308 --> 15:19.645
Wait, wait, who the hell is that with Bob?

15:19.712 --> 15:20.846
Hold on now.

15:26.919 --> 15:28.721
Hold on.

15:30.089 --> 15:31.090
Elzy?

15:31.156 --> 15:33.125
Let’s just give it a minute.

15:33.192 --> 15:35.261
I mean, maybe this guy’s shift’s ending and then Bob’s coming in.

15:35.327 --> 15:37.696
He would have said something if that was the case.

15:37.763 --> 15:40.599
Just give it a minute, okay?

15:41.934 --> 15:43.269
Sheriff!

15:43.335 --> 15:46.238
Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch is robbing the Union Flyer.

15:46.305 --> 15:48.340
We got this. Come on!

15:54.313 --> 15:56.649
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Union Flyer’s

15:56.715 --> 15:58.250
9:00 A.M. departure for Durango.

15:58.317 --> 16:00.119
Please have your tickets prepared for boarding.

16:01.453 --> 16:02.888
The Union Flyer?

16:02.955 --> 16:04.290
It’s not even the same train, Butch.

16:04.356 --> 16:06.292
What are we gonna do?

16:09.695 --> 16:10.930
I’m calling it.

16:10.996 --> 16:12.197
What’s that mean?

16:13.332 --> 16:15.034
We ain’t robbin’ the train now?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.702
Hell, no.

16:16.769 --> 16:18.604
I saw we do this kid.

16:18.671 --> 16:19.838
I need that money.

16:19.905 --> 16:20.973
All these trains come from Dubois

16:21.040 --> 16:22.374
got a company safe on them.

16:22.441 --> 16:25.744
They’re all headed west on that rail expansion.

16:25.811 --> 16:27.479
And there will be something on board.

16:27.546 --> 16:29.214
And we take whatever they got.

16:29.281 --> 16:30.249
Yeah.

16:38.223 --> 16:39.592
Follow me.

16:39.658 --> 16:41.126
Damn it, Curry.

16:41.193 --> 16:44.296
Last call aboard 9:00 a.m. Union Flyer. Thanks, sir.

16:46.999 --> 16:48.634
Greeting. Tickets, folks.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.540
Don’t do anything dumb, Mr. Conductor.

16:54.607 --> 16:56.342
We do as planned.

16:57.743 --> 16:59.311
Butch, you sure we should be doing this?

16:59.378 --> 17:02.014
We don’t know nothing about this train.

17:02.081 --> 17:04.984
Isom, I’m need you to calm down and focus.

17:07.386 --> 17:08.587
What we doing, Elzy?

17:08.654 --> 17:09.822
We’re going.

17:15.694 --> 17:18.897
And who might you be, sir?

17:18.964 --> 17:22.334
Name’s Edward. My friends call me Eddie.

17:22.401 --> 17:25.838
Well, Eddie, wait here a moment with my friends won’t ya?

17:25.904 --> 17:27.773
-Don’t do nothing stupid. -Yeah.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.974
You, too.

17:33.779 --> 17:35.814
Good morning, everyone.

17:35.881 --> 17:37.316
Now, I’m not looking to hurt you,

17:37.383 --> 17:39.284
and I’m not after your possessions.

17:39.351 --> 17:42.287
Just need a little bit of time and then you’re back

17:42.354 --> 17:47.059
on your way to Durango, is it? It’s a nice town.

17:47.126 --> 17:48.761
Y’all look like a smart bunch,

17:48.827 --> 17:51.230
so don’t nobody go trying to be a hero.

17:52.498 --> 17:54.033
Your lives ain’t worth it.

18:03.575 --> 18:04.810
Schofield?

18:07.846 --> 18:09.715
That’s a nice gun, old timer.

18:12.484 --> 18:13.419
Sit tight now.

18:17.456 --> 18:20.826
I got a dilemma I was hoping you could help me out with.

18:20.893 --> 18:23.095
Which one of these coaches has a safe on it, Eddie?

18:25.097 --> 18:27.166
Oh, they don’t tell us that.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.201
[gun clicks]

18:29.268 --> 18:31.170
It’s just a few cars back.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.173
Kindly take us there, won’t you?

18:34.239 --> 18:36.008
Yeah.

18:46.485 --> 18:49.655
Knew that seed spitting sack of shit Bob Meeks

18:49.722 --> 18:50.823
couldn’t be trusted.

18:50.889 --> 18:52.658
Working this shift all da, Eddie?.

18:52.725 --> 18:54.126
-What? -You heard me.

18:54.193 --> 18:56.595
Just you supposed to be the only one working here today?

18:56.662 --> 18:59.698
I don’t understand what you’re saying, son, but yeah,

18:59.765 --> 19:02.267
I’m working all day if that’s what you’re asking.

19:02.334 --> 19:05.137
You’re going to help us out today, huh, Eddie?

19:05.204 --> 19:07.740
Yeah. This is the car with the safe in it.

19:07.806 --> 19:11.543
Ain’t going to be no surprises on there. No guards?

19:11.610 --> 19:15.514
No, No, uh-uh, just the safe in there, I promise.

19:15.581 --> 19:18.150
Unlock that door and slide it open for us, won’t you?

19:18.217 --> 19:19.518
Yeah.

19:28.327 --> 19:31.330
Climb up in there and open the safe for us, will you, Eddie?

19:31.396 --> 19:33.298
I can’t.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.236
No, I can’t. I promise.

19:37.302 --> 19:40.739
Wells Fargo, they don’t give us the key no more.

19:40.806 --> 19:41.807
Liar.

19:41.874 --> 19:44.176
What he’s saying is true.

19:44.243 --> 19:45.477
Throw some gunpowder in that keyhole.

19:45.544 --> 19:47.546
-We’ll blast it open. -Sure thing.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.327
Hey, boss, that door is real thick.

20:02.394 --> 20:03.829
I’m going to have to use all the gunpowder.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.866
We’re already here.

20:07.933 --> 20:10.102
We ain’t walking away from this one.

20:10.169 --> 20:13.138
How big a blast are we talking?

20:13.205 --> 20:16.608
I mean... it ain’t gonna go beyond the car.

20:16.675 --> 20:17.976
Make sure.

20:18.043 --> 20:20.746
There’s kids and parents on the train.

20:20.813 --> 20:22.548
I want nobody getting hurt.

20:22.614 --> 20:23.816
You got it.

20:23.882 --> 20:24.817
Ha!

20:24.883 --> 20:26.218
You’re Butch Cassidy.

20:26.285 --> 20:28.253
Yeah. You all the wild bunch, ain’t ya?

20:28.320 --> 20:30.155
Of course, I should have figured that one out.

20:30.222 --> 20:32.457
See, Butch Cassidy don’t kill nobody.

20:32.524 --> 20:35.027
There’s always a first.

20:35.093 --> 20:36.962
Ain’t nobody getting killed.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.164
He knows who we are.

20:39.231 --> 20:41.600
And you won’t say nothing will ya, Eddie?

20:41.667 --> 20:43.535
No, I ain’t going to say nothing.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.309
Hey, you know, it was them Daltons.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.945
Dalton gang done did it. Yep.

20:53.011 --> 20:54.112
I’m ready to blow this thing, boss.

20:54.179 --> 20:56.348
All right, let’s clear the door.

20:56.415 --> 20:57.716
Where do you think you’re going?

20:57.783 --> 20:59.651
-Nowhere. Nowhere. -Get over there.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.320
All right.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.002
[explosion]

21:19.671 --> 21:23.976
It’s the Wild Bunch. We’re being robbed.

21:25.244 --> 21:27.012
Woo-hoo!

21:30.916 --> 21:32.251
Get.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.023
[cheering]

21:39.258 --> 21:41.159
Look at all that money!

21:41.226 --> 21:43.262
You wanted to walk a couple minutes ago.

21:43.328 --> 21:45.831
-I’m glad we didn’t. -What’d y’all find?

21:45.898 --> 21:48.333
Oh, it’s a good thing we didn’t walk on this one.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.801
Plenty of money for everyone, baby.

21:49.868 --> 21:51.370
Pretty good take, boys.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.272
Let’s get it packed up, let’s get it out of here.

22:04.483 --> 22:05.951
[gunshot]

22:13.759 --> 22:16.061
What the hell did you do?

22:16.128 --> 22:17.729
He made a run for it.

22:17.796 --> 22:20.232
You couldn’t have ran after him?

22:20.299 --> 22:21.967
I warned him the first time.

22:22.034 --> 22:24.002
I told you there was to be no killing.

22:27.306 --> 22:29.241
Get that loot packed up and let’s go.

22:32.844 --> 22:34.413
[laughs]

22:56.535 --> 22:57.469
They shot Eddie.

22:58.770 --> 23:00.305
[laughing]

23:01.573 --> 23:03.842
Oh, yeah, baby!

23:03.909 --> 23:06.044
[laughing]

23:08.547 --> 23:10.315
All right, let’s split up.

23:10.382 --> 23:12.451
Curry, Ben, Laura, you had east. We’ll ride west.

23:12.517 --> 23:13.719
Meet up at the Hole in the Wall tonight.

23:18.724 --> 23:20.692
I’ve had enough of this.

23:28.934 --> 23:31.636
I’m going to send a wire to Charles Siringo

23:31.703 --> 23:33.405
at the Pinkertons.

23:57.362 --> 23:58.730
[telegraph clicking]

24:13.245 --> 24:15.213
Chaz, bring that to me.

24:23.989 --> 24:25.424
What is it, Charlie?

24:28.927 --> 24:30.429
Butch Cassidy.

24:32.364 --> 24:35.233
And his Wild Bunch.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.439
They’ve robbed a train.

24:43.241 --> 24:44.743
And killed a man.

24:48.847 --> 24:51.049
Want me to hold off on the McCarty’s, help ya?

24:51.116 --> 24:52.784
No, I’ll handle this.

25:10.969 --> 25:12.370
What’s wrong, Butch?

25:12.437 --> 25:14.239
Need to make sure no one is following us.

25:18.844 --> 25:19.845
Looks like we’re clear.

25:27.185 --> 25:28.286
Sheriff!

25:28.353 --> 25:30.021
Sheriff, you just missed him.

25:30.088 --> 25:31.323
They killed Eddie.

25:31.389 --> 25:33.825
Aw, shit. Which way did they go, Bart?

25:33.892 --> 25:35.660
Kid Curry headed east with two of them

25:35.727 --> 25:37.729
and Butch and the other two, they gone west.

25:37.796 --> 25:40.432
Nobody seems to be able to stop the Wild Bunch.

25:40.499 --> 25:42.534
We’ll handle it.

25:48.874 --> 25:51.543
You think Elzy’s going to be all right riding off on his own?

25:51.610 --> 25:53.512
Yeah, he’ll be all right. He had to lead them off trail,

25:53.578 --> 25:55.180
make sure they don’t tail us.

25:55.247 --> 25:58.750
We should’ve never join up with Curry and them other two.

25:58.817 --> 26:01.186
They’re crazy.

26:01.253 --> 26:03.355
Killing that old man wasn’t right.

26:03.421 --> 26:05.190
No, no, it wasn’t.

26:05.257 --> 26:07.125
Ain’t nothing we can do about it now.

26:07.192 --> 26:11.429
I’ll tell you what we can do. We never work with them again.

26:11.496 --> 26:13.465
Yeah, when Will Carver gets out of prison,

26:13.532 --> 26:14.833
we can think about it.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.735
For now, we got to work with the folks we got.

26:16.801 --> 26:19.371
Otherwise, there ain’t no sense in calling us the Wild Bunch.

26:21.006 --> 26:22.874
Well, here they come.

26:22.941 --> 26:24.843
Got to get going here.

26:34.219 --> 26:35.520
-Come on, get ’em! -[gunshots]

26:35.587 --> 26:37.355
Gunshots! Hey, hey! Where are you going?

26:37.422 --> 26:40.492
Someone’s shooting at us!

26:55.207 --> 26:56.708
Come on, Sheriff.

26:56.775 --> 26:59.444
Pick up that gun. Pick it up.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.016
Shame.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.386
[gunshot]

27:15.560 --> 27:21.566
[harmonica playing]

27:30.342 --> 27:32.544
Shouldn’t they have made it by now?

27:32.611 --> 27:33.778
Maybe they camped out.

27:35.513 --> 27:36.815
Maybe they got caught.

27:39.951 --> 27:40.919
Doubtful.

27:42.854 --> 27:44.689
Or maybe they ain’t coming.

27:44.756 --> 27:46.291
Why wouldn’t they show up?

27:46.358 --> 27:48.526
Because they got a bigger share of the loot than we did.

27:48.593 --> 27:50.562
No, that ain’t Curry’s style.

27:50.629 --> 27:53.431
He’s violent, but always keeps his word.

27:53.498 --> 27:54.466
He’ll show.

27:54.532 --> 27:55.967
Yeah. Bob ain’t show.

27:56.034 --> 27:58.069
Let it go, Isom.

27:58.136 --> 28:00.505
Come on, fellas. What’s with the faces?

28:03.074 --> 28:05.677
I’m not too hungry right now, Maude.

28:05.744 --> 28:08.013
You don’t know what you missing, Butch.

28:08.079 --> 28:09.481
Ah, just take it.

28:09.547 --> 28:10.949
Maybe you’ll be hungry in a bit.

28:25.530 --> 28:27.732
Would you look at that?

28:28.967 --> 28:31.870
Sitting around a campfire, singing songs.

28:33.538 --> 28:35.674
You save some food for us, Maude?

28:35.740 --> 28:38.643
Yeah, I got some leftovers, Kid.

28:40.879 --> 28:42.047
What about Bob?

28:42.113 --> 28:44.749
He didn’t show. Something must have happened.

28:44.816 --> 28:47.986
-Anyone follow you? -No.

28:48.053 --> 28:50.021
-You? -No.

28:51.856 --> 28:54.659
Better wipe that look off your face, Butch.

28:54.726 --> 28:57.962
You killed someone at one of my jobs today.

28:58.029 --> 29:00.799
I told all y’all there was to be no killing.

29:00.865 --> 29:03.435
If you hadn’t trusted Elzy to bring on that bum Bob Meeks,

29:03.501 --> 29:05.203
nobody would have died.

29:05.270 --> 29:07.772
I’m sorry, Butch. I don’t know what happened, but I trust Bob.

29:07.839 --> 29:10.508
He’s a straight shooter.

29:10.575 --> 29:11.876
As the leader of this gang,

29:11.943 --> 29:13.912
I should have checked Bob out personally.

29:13.978 --> 29:16.448
Especially after you and Laura saw him

29:16.514 --> 29:18.783
confuse the name of the rail.

29:18.850 --> 29:21.986
If there’s anyone to blame, it’s me.

29:23.888 --> 29:26.624
It’s my fault that he died today.

29:26.691 --> 29:28.593
I’m glad we agree on something.

29:30.628 --> 29:32.764
So we going to split this money up or what?

29:34.099 --> 29:36.134
All right, then. Isom.

29:43.608 --> 29:46.111
[laughing]

29:46.177 --> 29:47.846
-Yeah! -Woo!

29:47.912 --> 29:49.714
[cheering]

29:49.781 --> 29:51.349
What’ll you buy me?

29:51.416 --> 29:53.084
Ooh, whatever you want, baby.

29:53.151 --> 29:55.120
I’m gonna spend a whole summer drowning in women and tequila!

30:02.794 --> 30:05.163
♪ I’ve been traveling ♪

30:06.798 --> 30:10.268
♪ All night long

30:10.335 --> 30:14.172
♪ I’ve been traveling ♪

30:14.239 --> 30:17.108
♪ Singing my song

30:18.977 --> 30:21.813
What you going to do with your share of the loot, Butch?

30:21.880 --> 30:23.047
Retire?

30:24.849 --> 30:26.284
You know ain’t nobody live long enough

30:26.351 --> 30:27.719
to retire from this, Isom.

30:29.053 --> 30:30.655
Still ain’t answering my question.

30:32.524 --> 30:35.260
Remember Mike and Alice Cassidy?

30:35.326 --> 30:38.696
Yeah, of course I do. Them the folks that adopted you.

30:38.763 --> 30:42.333
Well, you know, Mike has since passed on.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.370
Thinking about buying me a small ranch near their property

30:45.437 --> 30:47.038
outside of Dubois.

30:47.105 --> 30:50.742
I help Alice out a little on account of she’s all alone now.

30:50.809 --> 30:54.379
That’s... That’s might kind of you, Butch.

30:54.446 --> 30:57.115
What you going to do on a ranch?

30:59.617 --> 31:01.453
Someone got killed today, Isom.

31:01.519 --> 31:04.122
I don’t want no more of what happened today on my conscience.

31:06.291 --> 31:09.694
I mean, it was bound to happen sooner or later.

31:09.761 --> 31:11.529
Just come with the job.

31:12.797 --> 31:13.998
Feeling guilty for that conductor

31:14.065 --> 31:15.533
ain’t going to bring him back.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.135
So now that you got your share of the money,

31:17.202 --> 31:19.771
it don’t matter that Eddie was killed today?

31:19.838 --> 31:21.606
I didn’t mean it like that, Butch.

31:24.042 --> 31:25.810
I’m sorry that we killed him.

31:29.113 --> 31:32.617
I’m talking about you, anyways. This ranch of yours.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.853
Being a rancher.

31:34.919 --> 31:37.021
Chicken, cattle, you know, cows, all that.

31:38.890 --> 31:40.492
That’s really what you want?

31:40.558 --> 31:42.760
I want to be like Mike Cassidy.

31:42.827 --> 31:45.630
Wake up, do the same thing every day.

31:45.697 --> 31:47.398
Chores, tend to the animals.

31:47.465 --> 31:50.502
Have real work to do.

31:50.568 --> 31:53.304
Growing up with him, I liked that things had to get done.

31:53.371 --> 31:56.608
Work had to get done every day.

31:56.674 --> 32:00.211
Every day, I had responsibilities.

32:00.278 --> 32:04.015
Don’t sound too bad, really. Owning you’re own land.

32:08.453 --> 32:10.221
My daddy and his daddy,

32:10.288 --> 32:12.590
they spent their whole lives on the plantation.

32:15.727 --> 32:19.898
I was lucky, I guess. I got emancipated.

32:23.368 --> 32:27.171
Hell, I might buy a ranch right next to you.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.107
Gonna have to do a couple more jobs first.

32:34.279 --> 32:36.014
Remember those numbers.

32:36.080 --> 32:41.019
I got a safe at the Dubois Bank. It’s the combination to it.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.720
You’re welcome to what’s in there.

32:45.356 --> 32:47.058
That’s much appreciated, Butch,

32:47.125 --> 32:49.160
but I don’t want no handouts.

32:49.227 --> 32:50.929
That’s... That’s your money.

32:50.995 --> 32:52.797
If you’re serious about buying some property,

32:52.864 --> 32:54.165
consider it a loan.

32:54.232 --> 32:57.735
Get out now and pay me back when you can.

32:57.802 --> 33:01.039
I don’t know if I’m ready for something like that yet.

33:06.411 --> 33:08.713
Suit yourself.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.815
Money’s there if you change your mind.

33:48.286 --> 33:52.090
Go ahead and hold onto that for me, won’t you, Elzy?

33:52.156 --> 33:53.458
Where you going?

33:53.524 --> 33:55.860
Go check out some property.

33:55.927 --> 33:58.930
-Y’all gonna be here, right? -Hell yeah, we’ll be here.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.665
We ain’t going nowhere. We drank too much last night.

34:00.732 --> 34:02.433
Yeah, we did, babe.

34:08.573 --> 34:10.742
What are your plans?

34:12.343 --> 34:14.545
Ride out to Robber’s Roost, maybe.

34:14.612 --> 34:17.448
We’re going to help Harry Tracy on a job.

34:17.515 --> 34:18.816
Careful on them trails.

34:18.883 --> 34:20.718
They’ll be looking harder for us now.

34:22.220 --> 34:25.189
-Ready? -It’s a new day, Butch.

34:33.598 --> 34:35.333
Get out.

34:37.402 --> 34:38.836
[grunts]

34:40.538 --> 34:41.873
Hold this a minute.

34:43.307 --> 34:44.242
Hey, Karl.

34:47.945 --> 34:50.114
Am I to understand you got money to buy whiskey

34:50.181 --> 34:51.749
but not pay for a chicken?

34:53.251 --> 34:54.686
Huh?

34:54.752 --> 34:56.654
I said I’d pay him next week.

34:56.721 --> 34:59.157
That doesn’t answer my question.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.391
[grunting]

35:05.930 --> 35:08.433
Okay, I’m sorry. I promise.

35:08.499 --> 35:10.435
[groaning]

35:10.501 --> 35:12.704
I won’t do it ag--

35:12.770 --> 35:17.175
No. You won’t.

35:19.210 --> 35:24.849
Theft will not be tolerated in Cheyenne.

35:24.916 --> 35:28.453
And I don’t give a damn if it’s a chicken,

35:28.519 --> 35:31.756
a hog, or a herd of cattle

35:35.426 --> 35:36.427
Now get.

35:38.596 --> 35:39.597
All of you, get.

35:39.664 --> 35:40.865
Come on, let’s go.

35:46.804 --> 35:48.306
You hard of hearing, mister?

35:53.978 --> 35:56.748
So this Karl fella,

35:56.814 --> 35:59.784
is he a big problem here in Cheyenne?

35:59.851 --> 36:03.287
No. That was his first offense.

36:04.489 --> 36:05.456
[chuckles]

36:07.325 --> 36:11.496
-Did I say something funny? -No. No.

36:13.264 --> 36:18.870
I just admire your brand of justice, Mr. Horn.

36:18.936 --> 36:21.706
It’s called the law around here.

36:21.773 --> 36:22.940
Fair enough.

36:24.142 --> 36:26.511
Is there something you want, Mr. Siringo?

36:26.577 --> 36:30.515
I’m bringing in Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch.

36:31.682 --> 36:33.384
Dead or alive.

36:34.485 --> 36:37.922
You may have heard that they killed

36:37.989 --> 36:41.125
an elder conductor over in Wilcox.

36:42.226 --> 36:44.428
Shot him in the back.

36:44.495 --> 36:48.332
They also murdered some local lawmen.

36:48.399 --> 36:52.103
Yeah, I heard something about that.

36:54.205 --> 36:57.542
But it was Kid Curry that did most of the killing, was it not?

36:57.608 --> 36:59.877
Nonetheless.

36:59.944 --> 37:02.847
Wild Bunch needs to be brought to justice.

37:05.082 --> 37:09.387
Hung by their necks, every last one of them.

37:10.621 --> 37:14.258
And I wanted to see if I could recruit you,

37:14.325 --> 37:18.262
Mr. Horn, in my endeavors.

37:18.329 --> 37:21.032
I’m pretty settled in here at the moment.

37:21.098 --> 37:22.600
Understood.

37:26.037 --> 37:28.105
You know...

37:28.172 --> 37:33.144
The bounty is up to $30,000 for the whole Wild Bunch.

37:35.179 --> 37:38.950
And I would be willing, Mr. Horn,

37:39.016 --> 37:41.352
to split that reward with you.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.155
50/50.

37:45.790 --> 37:47.491
That’s a lot of money.

37:49.327 --> 37:50.595
It’s a lot of money.

38:04.742 --> 38:06.043
We’re awfully close to where we did that job

38:06.110 --> 38:07.478
in Wilcox, ain’t we?

38:07.545 --> 38:10.314
You know I want to be close to Alice Cassidy.

38:10.381 --> 38:12.250
Yeah. I keep forgetting about Miss Cassidy.

38:13.851 --> 38:16.587
What’s the local law like here?

38:16.654 --> 38:19.290
They know me, on account of Mike.

38:19.357 --> 38:20.758
As long as I don’t do nothing wrong

38:20.825 --> 38:22.293
in Dubois, they look the other way.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.861
And I intend to keep it like that.

38:23.928 --> 38:27.064
Plus another banker here helped Mike with all his affairs.

38:40.444 --> 38:41.579
Isom.

38:45.716 --> 38:47.251
You want that money that’s in my safe,

38:47.318 --> 38:48.519
why don’t you go on and get it?

38:48.586 --> 38:50.221
I told you, I don’t want no handout.

38:50.288 --> 38:51.489
Ain’t a handout, it’s a loan.

38:51.555 --> 38:53.190
I don’t want no loan, either.

38:53.257 --> 38:55.192
I told you I make the money myself.

38:55.259 --> 38:56.928
Do it just like you.

38:56.994 --> 38:58.930
When I’m ready.

38:58.996 --> 39:01.399
You gotta learn to commit to things, Isom.

39:01.465 --> 39:02.767
Going back and forth all the time,

39:02.833 --> 39:04.268
don’t make up your head about nothing.

39:04.335 --> 39:05.670
Gonna be the death of you one day.

39:07.204 --> 39:10.608
Mr. Santiago Maxwell, how are you?

39:10.675 --> 39:11.809
Good.

39:11.876 --> 39:15.313
I’m Fred Boone. No relation to Daniel Boone.

39:15.379 --> 39:17.581
-How are you? -I’m good, sir.

39:17.648 --> 39:21.218
I’m Ted... Hiddlebottom.

39:21.285 --> 39:24.055
So we are purchasing the Bartlett ranch

39:24.121 --> 39:26.223
just on the outskirts of our little town.

39:26.290 --> 39:28.059
-Correct, Mr. Maxwell? -Yes, sir, that’s right.

39:28.125 --> 39:31.162
I imagine we’ll be paying cash for this transaction?

39:31.228 --> 39:33.965
Or will it be in gold?

39:34.031 --> 39:37.501
-Cash. -Cash is still good.

39:38.369 --> 39:40.271
Oh, missing a few pages.

39:40.338 --> 39:44.241
I’ll be right back. Please, excuse me.

39:44.308 --> 39:46.143
How much does this man know about you, Butch?

39:46.210 --> 39:49.046
Asking if you’re paying in cash or gold?

39:49.113 --> 39:51.082
Relax. He’s only asking about--

39:51.148 --> 39:53.384
Don’t tell me to relax. All right?

39:53.451 --> 39:55.987
Does he or does he not know who you are?

39:56.053 --> 39:57.555
He knows who I am.

39:57.621 --> 40:00.324
Just like the local law.

40:00.391 --> 40:03.394
Fred altered Mike’s cattle and horse paperwork.

40:03.461 --> 40:05.563
Never steered him wrong in all them years.

40:07.498 --> 40:09.734
Here we go. If you gentlemen follow me,

40:09.800 --> 40:11.035
I can take care of you.

40:20.378 --> 40:24.015
This is the title and the deed,

40:24.081 --> 40:26.784
and I just need your signature here, here,

40:26.851 --> 40:28.319
here, and here.

40:32.223 --> 40:34.492
How is Alice these days?

40:34.558 --> 40:36.761
I’m hoping to help her out some.

40:36.827 --> 40:40.364
That explains why you wanted to purchase land there.

40:40.431 --> 40:42.400
You have a generous heart.

40:42.466 --> 40:45.102
Always in the right place.

40:45.169 --> 40:49.173
Now there’s just the actual money transfer.

40:50.875 --> 40:55.546
Wonderful. I won’t even bother to count it.

40:55.613 --> 40:56.781
Just kidding.

40:58.315 --> 40:59.717
I’m gonna get some fresh air.

41:06.223 --> 41:09.427
Your friend seems of the nervous sort.

41:12.797 --> 41:14.298
The money’s all there.

41:14.365 --> 41:17.768
You are now the proud owner of the Bartlet Ranch.

41:17.835 --> 41:19.270
Congratulations.

41:19.336 --> 41:21.572
-Thank you, Fred. -You’re welcome, as always.

41:21.639 --> 41:25.109
And please, give my regards to Mrs. Cassidy.

41:26.444 --> 41:28.712
One more thing for you.

41:30.014 --> 41:32.983
Some cookies from the "wife".

41:33.050 --> 41:35.152
Oh, thank you.

41:35.219 --> 41:37.288
I can’t wait to eat them.

41:37.354 --> 41:39.824
Oh, Mr. Maxwell...

41:52.403 --> 41:54.872
Just a little note about a gold mine.

41:54.939 --> 41:56.740
Wait until you’re out of town to read it.

42:10.955 --> 42:14.258
That man is the craziest banker I’ve ever seen in my life.

42:14.325 --> 42:16.694
Yeah, he might be strange, but he is helpful.

42:18.496 --> 42:20.664
What do you say we grab a drink to celebrate?

42:20.731 --> 42:23.901
-You buying? -Of course I am.

42:23.968 --> 42:25.202
I could use a drink.

42:30.074 --> 42:31.075
Hey!

42:31.142 --> 42:32.476
-Sorry, sir. -Watch it.

42:34.044 --> 42:36.881
Thought you said everyone in this town was friendly.

42:36.947 --> 42:39.350
Don’t know him.

42:39.416 --> 42:41.886
Hey, isn’t that that fella, Isom Dart?

42:41.952 --> 42:43.287
I think so.

42:43.354 --> 42:44.855
There’s a reward out for him.

42:46.290 --> 42:47.958
Excuse me, sirs.

42:49.927 --> 42:51.862
Hey, get back here!

43:05.876 --> 43:08.012
You say you never seen them guys before?

43:08.078 --> 43:09.446
Never.

43:09.513 --> 43:12.349
Hey, guess I gotta buy you that drink another time.

43:12.416 --> 43:14.218
Best to be clear out of here before they come to.

43:14.285 --> 43:16.253
Yeah, I agree with that.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.789
You want to come back to my ranch with me?

43:18.856 --> 43:20.691
I got to get back to the Hole in the Wall and

43:20.758 --> 43:22.993
make sure Elzy and ain’t get off with my share of the loot.

43:23.060 --> 43:26.864
Be careful now. We’ll all meet up again, soon.

43:26.931 --> 43:28.098
Of course, Butch.

43:28.165 --> 43:33.003
Hey, I appreciate you bringing me along today.

43:33.070 --> 43:34.438
It’s been real exciting.

43:34.505 --> 43:36.874
Think about what I said about the loan.

43:37.942 --> 43:39.443
I will.

43:42.279 --> 43:44.315
Get out of here.

43:44.381 --> 43:45.616
I’ll see you, Butch.

44:10.841 --> 44:13.110
Are you sure it was Isom Dart?

44:13.177 --> 44:14.912
Come on, Sheriff.

44:17.281 --> 44:18.349
Look who it is.

44:18.415 --> 44:20.718
♪ Lord have mercy...

44:20.784 --> 44:24.722
Excuse me, sir. We need to talk to you.

44:28.125 --> 44:29.593
God damn.

44:34.598 --> 44:36.600
Turn around slowly.

44:36.667 --> 44:39.837
Don’t make any moves for that gun on your hip.

44:42.606 --> 44:44.475
Now, that’s Isom Dart.

44:44.541 --> 44:47.077
He’s wanted for cattle rustling.

44:57.821 --> 45:02.293
Isom Dart was arrested in Dubois.

45:02.359 --> 45:04.495
Well, well.

45:04.561 --> 45:06.030
Looks like we’re going to have to pay

45:06.096 --> 45:07.865
a little visit to Dubois.

45:42.700 --> 45:44.401
You look parched.

45:45.402 --> 45:46.804
Thank you, Alice.

45:46.870 --> 45:49.473
Why don’t you take a break?

45:49.540 --> 45:51.241
You know, it’s been a while since

45:51.308 --> 45:53.010
you’ve done this kind of work.

45:56.513 --> 45:59.283
I sure wish Mike could see you now.

45:59.350 --> 46:01.885
He’d be so proud of you.

46:05.823 --> 46:08.625
Oh, you still have his old pocket watch?

46:09.426 --> 46:10.761
Yeah, I do.

46:14.331 --> 46:17.501
There’s something else going on with you, ain’t there?

46:19.870 --> 46:21.705
Mike made all this look so easy.

46:25.809 --> 46:28.112
Mike made everything look easy.

46:29.780 --> 46:32.449
But answer me this.

46:32.516 --> 46:34.818
Why, after all them years,

46:34.885 --> 46:37.621
do you want to come back to what you left?

46:37.688 --> 46:39.490
Alls I know is I want something more

46:39.556 --> 46:40.958
than robbing banks and trains.

46:41.024 --> 46:43.060
If that makes sense.

46:43.127 --> 46:44.828
Sure it does.

46:46.530 --> 46:47.765
Kid Curry killing that poor conductor

46:47.831 --> 46:49.833
didn’t help none either.

46:49.900 --> 46:51.135
Mike never killed nobody.

46:52.770 --> 46:54.138
No, he didn’t.

46:56.407 --> 46:59.810
But he sure came close a couple of times.

47:02.479 --> 47:04.848
Excuse me.

47:04.915 --> 47:07.217
Did either of you lose a horse?

47:07.284 --> 47:11.622
I found a wild one over yonder hill grazing on my property.

47:11.688 --> 47:14.024
Wouldn’t let me near it.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.428
Must be old Billy.

47:17.494 --> 47:20.230
Let him wander from time to time.

47:20.297 --> 47:23.734
You’re not worried someone’s gonna snatch him?

47:23.801 --> 47:26.036
I do apologize for the inconvenience.

47:26.103 --> 47:30.207
He usually manages to find his way back home.

47:30.274 --> 47:33.076
Well, I see you’re working on a fence.

47:33.143 --> 47:34.745
That’s a start.

47:36.713 --> 47:37.881
I’m Alice, miss.

47:37.948 --> 47:40.651
-And you are? -Etta. Etta Place.

47:40.717 --> 47:43.053
-Pleasure to meet you. -And you.

47:46.123 --> 47:49.092
Well, your horse has a name. I reckon you have one, too.

47:51.595 --> 47:54.298
Robert Parker, miss.

47:54.364 --> 47:56.633
Nice to meet you, Robert Parker.

47:56.700 --> 47:59.203
Could be straighter.

47:59.269 --> 48:04.608
Yeah. Guess I don’t got such a great eye for straight lines.

48:04.675 --> 48:07.244
That’s an easy fix. Got some twine?

48:07.311 --> 48:09.947
Rope?

48:10.013 --> 48:11.114
Thin rope.

48:12.749 --> 48:16.153
-No. -I’ll be back.

48:23.627 --> 48:24.828
Think I’m in love.

48:26.630 --> 48:30.634
Robert Parker, you don’t even know what it’s like

48:30.701 --> 48:32.236
to be in love.

48:41.778 --> 48:44.081
This town smells of shit.

48:44.147 --> 48:48.418
Do you ever say anything pleasant, Mr. Horn?

48:48.485 --> 48:50.587
How do you want to go about this?

48:50.654 --> 48:53.257
What I want is to find out where they are.

48:53.323 --> 48:54.758
No matter what it takes.

48:56.393 --> 49:00.097
I hold now status of law outside of Cheyenne, Mr. Siringo.

49:01.498 --> 49:03.367
I noticed you don’t wear badge.

49:03.433 --> 49:06.637
So how is it that you attained your position of authority

49:06.703 --> 49:09.072
in Cheyenne, exactly, Mr. Horn?

49:12.743 --> 49:14.878
Understood.

49:14.945 --> 49:17.881
This is your lucky day.

49:22.486 --> 49:23.754
Oh...

49:26.423 --> 49:28.258
It’s official.

49:29.359 --> 49:30.761
You’re a Pinkerton now.

49:32.796 --> 49:34.331
Thank you for your help today, Etta.

49:34.398 --> 49:36.099
It was my pleasure.

49:36.166 --> 49:39.236
Always happy to lend a helping hand to a new neighbor.

49:39.303 --> 49:42.539
As long as I don’t find his horse on my property again.

49:42.606 --> 49:44.041
That’d be such a bad thing?

49:45.709 --> 49:49.012
How did you get so handy?

49:49.079 --> 49:52.182
Well, my dad was a cattle man and I was an only child.

49:52.249 --> 49:55.919
He wasted no time putting me to work on that ranch.

49:59.156 --> 50:01.191
You know, there was this one time

50:01.258 --> 50:03.827
when Mike was trying to teach Robert

50:03.894 --> 50:06.763
how to saddle a horse, all proper and all.

50:06.830 --> 50:09.800
And Robert wasn’t having none of it.

50:09.866 --> 50:11.802
And Mike was trying to tell him,

50:11.868 --> 50:14.705
a horse keeps air in its belly,

50:14.771 --> 50:18.141
so you got to wait to cinch those straps.

50:18.208 --> 50:22.613
And Robert snaps back, "I know how to ride a horse, Mike.

50:22.679 --> 50:24.047
I ain’t no kid."

50:24.114 --> 50:27.351
And he was like 16 years old, mind you.

50:29.720 --> 50:31.054
And what happened?

50:31.121 --> 50:35.025
Well, he spurred ol’ Cinco and he took off.

50:35.092 --> 50:38.996
And sure enough, that saddle slid to the right

50:39.062 --> 50:43.834
and Robert fell off over the fence into the pig slop.

50:45.335 --> 50:47.237
It was a mess.

50:47.304 --> 50:50.340
Mike wouldn’t let him come in the house for a week.

50:50.407 --> 50:52.576
Made him sleep in the barn.

50:52.643 --> 50:54.177
I would’ve done the same thing.

50:58.181 --> 50:59.149
Get out.

50:59.216 --> 51:00.817
[grunting]

51:09.126 --> 51:10.293
[gunshot]

51:14.164 --> 51:17.300
Hey, hey! Watch where you’re going.

51:17.367 --> 51:19.202
Bob! Bob!

51:19.269 --> 51:21.471
Who you running from, mister?

51:23.640 --> 51:24.775
Move on.

51:32.916 --> 51:34.751
Mr. Horn, Isom’s been sentenced.

51:34.818 --> 51:35.952
He’s going to serve his time.

51:36.019 --> 51:38.355
Leave him be, Sheriff.

51:42.659 --> 51:47.431
You were seen with Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch

51:47.497 --> 51:49.966
at the Wilcox train robbery.

51:54.705 --> 51:56.073
[screams]

52:00.677 --> 52:03.380
I ain’t going to ask you again.

52:03.447 --> 52:07.184
I ain’t telling you nothing, you goddamn Pinkerton.

52:07.250 --> 52:10.821
I could put a few more bullets in that leg of yours.

52:10.887 --> 52:13.390
And you will never use that leg again.

52:14.991 --> 52:17.561
Or you can tell me what I want to know.

52:17.627 --> 52:19.529
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

52:22.332 --> 52:24.167
Mr. Horn, no!

52:27.270 --> 52:29.106
[gunshot]

52:42.385 --> 52:45.122
I was hoping Isom Dart would give up

52:45.188 --> 52:46.990
Butch Cassidy’s location.

52:49.593 --> 52:50.861
But...

52:56.266 --> 52:58.535
I guess I should have just asked you.

53:04.307 --> 53:08.145
You see, a reliable source informed me...

53:09.412 --> 53:13.884
that the local law, that’d be you,

53:13.950 --> 53:17.220
looks the other way here in Dubois.

53:17.287 --> 53:21.258
That Butch Cassidy frequents Dubois.

53:22.859 --> 53:25.095
And has for some time.

53:28.098 --> 53:32.903
I’d really hate to start killing off

53:32.969 --> 53:37.107
fellow law enforcement to get what I need.

53:37.174 --> 53:39.209
There’s no need for that, Detective.

53:39.276 --> 53:42.712
Butch used to stay out at Mike and Alice Cassidy’s ranch.

53:42.779 --> 53:44.548
But if you want the whole gang,

53:44.614 --> 53:47.517
your best bet is to find them at the Hole in the Wall.

53:47.584 --> 53:50.187
The Hole in the Wall.

53:50.253 --> 53:53.390
That pass out there in Big Horn mountains?

53:53.456 --> 53:55.926
Yes, sir. I hear that’s where the Wild Bunch meet up

53:55.992 --> 53:58.161
after a robbery.

53:58.228 --> 54:01.064
You’re likely to find them all there.

54:01.131 --> 54:02.833
That’s what I hear.

54:02.899 --> 54:04.501
You know where that place is?

54:04.568 --> 54:06.036
Yes, I do.

54:08.538 --> 54:09.973
You know...

54:12.309 --> 54:17.781
I don’t take kindly to the law overlooking fugitives.

54:17.848 --> 54:21.117
Butch Cassidy never created no problems here, Mr. Siringo,

54:21.184 --> 54:25.422
Never conducted no illegal activities.

54:25.488 --> 54:28.158
I would have locked him up if he had.

54:28.225 --> 54:30.327
I mean, in his defense...

54:31.561 --> 54:33.663
he kind of helped out around here.

54:33.730 --> 54:36.566
Picking up a hammer to fix a leaky roof

54:36.633 --> 54:38.635
or give money to poor folk.

54:38.702 --> 54:44.007
He never created no trouble here in Dubois, I promise.

54:47.043 --> 54:48.945
He sounds like a real saint.

54:53.016 --> 54:55.452
Pick up that trash off the street.

54:55.518 --> 54:56.519
Yes, sir, I will.

55:00.824 --> 55:04.461
Were those stories Alice was telling embarrassing you?

55:04.527 --> 55:07.497
Because they shouldn’t. They’re cute.

55:07.564 --> 55:09.699
No, it just makes you miss Mike, is all.

55:12.335 --> 55:15.105
Yeah, I miss my parents, too.

55:17.440 --> 55:21.144
Why do you call them Mike and Alice and not mom and dad?

55:21.211 --> 55:22.979
They ain’t my real parents.

55:25.382 --> 55:27.851
Ran away from home when I was young,

55:27.918 --> 55:29.886
and I met Mike when I got caught

55:29.953 --> 55:32.022
stealing food from the grocery store.

55:32.088 --> 55:34.024
He offered to pay for it and

55:34.090 --> 55:36.559
asked me if I wanted a job on his ranch.

55:38.328 --> 55:41.898
Kind of ended up being like a father to me.

55:41.965 --> 55:43.400
Guess they sort of adopted me.

55:45.201 --> 55:47.570
Well, that’s mighty generous.

55:51.708 --> 55:54.577
So you live alone?

55:54.644 --> 55:56.079
I live with my man.

55:57.514 --> 55:58.748
Oh.

56:00.417 --> 56:03.219
Where’s he at? When do I get to meet him?

56:03.286 --> 56:05.722
Well, he’s out of town for a spell.

56:05.789 --> 56:07.958
I don’t even know if you’d like him.

56:08.024 --> 56:10.160
Probably wouldn’t get along.

56:10.226 --> 56:13.096
He’s different from you, that’s for sure.

56:13.163 --> 56:18.001
-How so? -Well, he’s loud. Very loud.

56:19.369 --> 56:21.438
And he dresses fancy.

56:21.504 --> 56:22.906
Fancy?

56:22.973 --> 56:25.342
Don’t seem like you’d be with a kind of fella like that.

56:26.743 --> 56:29.612
Yeah, well, I like fancy.

56:31.481 --> 56:32.615
What about you?

56:32.682 --> 56:34.551
-What about me? -Why don’t you have a girl?

56:35.919 --> 56:39.155
Yes. I guess I just haven’t made time for it.

56:39.222 --> 56:41.324
Maybe I haven’t met the right one yet.

57:01.177 --> 57:03.079
[panting]

57:13.590 --> 57:15.291
I say we take our chances and go in.

57:15.358 --> 57:18.328
Patience, Mr. Horn. Patience.

57:19.396 --> 57:22.198
-Hey, Maude? -Yeah, baby?

57:22.265 --> 57:24.100
I’m through with patience.

57:26.102 --> 57:27.237
[grunts]

57:38.748 --> 57:40.717
You got him.

57:40.784 --> 57:42.385
She’s still moving.

57:53.096 --> 57:56.533
Hole in the Wall. I heard stories about this place.

57:56.599 --> 57:59.869
Yeah, it looks like someone was here, but left in a hurry.

57:59.936 --> 58:02.572
Yeah, who knows?

58:02.639 --> 58:05.542
Gunshots look like they echoed pretty good in here.

58:05.608 --> 58:07.777
I should have thought about that.

58:09.846 --> 58:11.648
Who is she?

58:13.316 --> 58:18.021
This is Maude Davis, the woman to the now

58:18.088 --> 58:21.124
deceased William "Elzy" Ellsworth here.

58:21.191 --> 58:22.559
[Maude groans]

58:25.962 --> 58:27.330
She’s not going to make it.

58:36.639 --> 58:39.242
Now we have to find this Alice Cassidy.

58:42.011 --> 58:44.380
How do you wish to proceed?

58:44.447 --> 58:46.182
With extreme caution.

59:00.029 --> 59:02.232
Butch... Butch!

59:02.298 --> 59:04.434
I got a visit from

59:04.501 --> 59:06.870
the U.S. Marshal’s Office this morning.

59:06.936 --> 59:09.806
They said Mike owes years of back taxes

59:09.873 --> 59:13.042
and they’re going to seize the ranch for payment.

59:13.109 --> 59:15.778
I can’t lose his ranch. I can’t.

59:15.845 --> 59:17.614
Nobody’s going to take your ranch from you, Alice.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.215
All right? What’s all this?

59:19.282 --> 59:21.618
It’s all them papers they handed me

59:21.684 --> 59:25.889
about how Mike owes the state money and such.

59:28.925 --> 59:32.061
I can’t understand all this law talk.

59:32.128 --> 59:35.365
Is Etta around? Maybe she can make some sense out of it.

59:35.431 --> 59:37.500
No, I ain’t seen her in a few days.

59:37.567 --> 59:40.303
I don’t know what I’m going to do.

59:41.838 --> 59:43.273
Go see Fred at the bank.

59:43.339 --> 59:45.942
He’ll know what to do. He always does.

59:46.009 --> 59:49.879
Maybe it’s too soon for you to go back into town.

59:49.946 --> 59:51.814
You let me worry about that.

59:51.881 --> 59:54.951
I’m a mother, I worry about everything.

1:00:17.740 --> 1:00:18.875
Hello, Alice.

1:00:18.942 --> 1:00:20.543
Hello, Fred. So nice to see you again.

1:00:20.610 --> 1:00:23.213
Mr. Maxwell. What’s all this about?

1:00:23.279 --> 1:00:24.581
Alice has a little paperwork problem

1:00:24.647 --> 1:00:25.848
she’d like you to look at.

1:00:25.915 --> 1:00:27.550
Let me see what you got.

1:00:29.786 --> 1:00:33.356
Our government at times can be so perverse.

1:00:33.423 --> 1:00:35.858
Robbing a widow of all she has left.

1:00:35.925 --> 1:00:36.893
It’s despicable.

1:00:40.930 --> 1:00:42.265
And there you go.

1:00:42.332 --> 1:00:44.534
These papers officially state that all

1:00:44.601 --> 1:00:46.669
back taxes have been paid in full.

1:00:46.736 --> 1:00:50.607
But I didn’t pay you anything.

1:00:50.673 --> 1:00:53.843
These papers say you did. Right there.

1:00:53.910 --> 1:00:56.679
But somehow the funds were lost

1:00:56.746 --> 1:00:59.382
in transit to the governor’s office.

1:01:01.150 --> 1:01:03.987
But that’s not what happened.

1:01:04.053 --> 1:01:05.688
It won’t be a problem.

1:01:05.755 --> 1:01:07.924
You and Mike have been customers here

1:01:07.991 --> 1:01:10.727
since I was a kid, sweeping up the floors.

1:01:10.793 --> 1:01:13.730
You deserve to live out life peacefully

1:01:13.796 --> 1:01:17.000
and not be constrained by our money-hungry government.

1:01:19.502 --> 1:01:21.471
Thank you, Fred.

1:02:09.619 --> 1:02:11.921
Hands where I can see them.

1:02:15.391 --> 1:02:16.859
Make a move with your gun,

1:02:16.926 --> 1:02:19.562
it’ll be the last thing you do, I assure you.

1:02:22.598 --> 1:02:24.500
Place it on the table for me, won’t you?

1:02:32.108 --> 1:02:33.376
Do I know you?

1:02:35.745 --> 1:02:37.113
Nope.

1:02:39.716 --> 1:02:42.118
I heard a story about a man once

1:02:42.185 --> 1:02:45.488
carved a combination to a safe into his pistol.

1:02:45.555 --> 1:02:46.823
You know something about that?

1:02:48.858 --> 1:02:51.494
I reckon a lot of men done that one time or another.

1:02:55.732 --> 1:02:57.467
Ooh, careful now.

1:02:57.533 --> 1:02:59.836
Our government will take you for everything.

1:03:03.506 --> 1:03:05.041
Howdy, señor.

1:03:05.108 --> 1:03:06.743
Would you mind filling up a bag for me, please?

1:03:06.809 --> 1:03:08.378
You know what? Make it two.

1:03:08.444 --> 1:03:11.714
Oh, and go easy on the coins, would you? They get heavy.

1:03:15.418 --> 1:03:17.353
What are you looking at?

1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:18.955
Your bank’s getting robbed.

1:03:22.892 --> 1:03:24.327
Thank you very much, sir.

1:03:24.394 --> 1:03:26.295
Have yourself a nice rest of your day.

1:03:26.362 --> 1:03:30.666
And as for the rest of you, have yourself a good day, too.

1:03:30.733 --> 1:03:34.637
It is a beautiful day outside. The sun is shining.

1:03:39.942 --> 1:03:41.544
It’s good to be alive.

1:03:48.117 --> 1:03:49.986
Whoo!

1:03:50.052 --> 1:03:51.821
That was exciting.

1:03:51.888 --> 1:03:55.391
Well, I do have a claim to file now.

1:03:55.458 --> 1:03:57.160
And alert the sheriff.

1:03:57.226 --> 1:04:01.030
And those back property taxes you’ve paid,

1:04:01.097 --> 1:04:03.366
they were just stolen.

1:04:03.433 --> 1:04:06.068
You see? Everything works out.

1:04:08.971 --> 1:04:11.941
Thank you for taking me to see Fred.

1:04:12.008 --> 1:04:15.778
He’s always been such a nice man.

1:04:15.845 --> 1:04:19.215
Are you sure you didn’t know who that bank robber was?

1:04:19.282 --> 1:04:20.950
No, never seen him before.

1:04:26.756 --> 1:04:28.090
Are you okay?

1:04:29.759 --> 1:04:31.327
Go get on your horse and ride home.

1:04:31.394 --> 1:04:32.628
I’ll catch up to you.

1:04:32.695 --> 1:04:33.963
What is it?

1:04:36.065 --> 1:04:37.567
Trouble.

1:04:37.633 --> 1:04:39.101
You be safe.

1:05:14.670 --> 1:05:15.605
Hands up.

1:05:15.671 --> 1:05:17.006
Hold it right there.

1:05:19.275 --> 1:05:22.111
That’s far enough.

1:05:22.178 --> 1:05:24.080
You’re that fella that robbed that bank, ain’t you?

1:05:25.715 --> 1:05:27.783
Why are you following me?

1:05:27.850 --> 1:05:30.820
Would you believe me if I said I wasn’t following you?

1:05:30.887 --> 1:05:32.955
No, sir, I would not.

1:05:33.022 --> 1:05:34.590
You really ought to think about removing those

1:05:34.657 --> 1:05:37.059
numbers from your gun, Butch Cassidy.

1:05:40.096 --> 1:05:42.665
You told my girl your name was Robert Parker.

1:05:42.732 --> 1:05:45.101
Who’s your girl?

1:05:45.167 --> 1:05:46.102
Etta Place.

1:05:49.138 --> 1:05:50.973
Should have used that other name you throw around.

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:54.310
What is it? Maxwell Sanchez.

1:05:55.611 --> 1:05:57.113
I’m Harry Longbaugh.

1:05:57.179 --> 1:06:00.816
You can call me Sundance. Sundance Kid.

1:06:00.883 --> 1:06:05.054
I know I’m not as famous as you yet, but I aim to be.

1:06:08.057 --> 1:06:10.826
I have some information to give you. It’s important.

1:06:10.893 --> 1:06:13.796
But first, would you mind putting that gun down?

1:06:13.863 --> 1:06:16.198
I can be a lot more useful to you alive than dead.

1:06:21.504 --> 1:06:22.939
Thank you.

1:06:23.005 --> 1:06:25.708
Well, what do you got to tell me?

1:06:25.775 --> 1:06:29.178
I have been told from a reliable source

1:06:29.245 --> 1:06:32.848
that the Pinkerton Detective Agency is looking for you.

1:06:32.915 --> 1:06:35.384
Fellow by the name of Charlie Siringo

1:06:35.451 --> 1:06:38.854
and a no good gun for hire, Tom Horn out of Cheyenne.

1:06:38.921 --> 1:06:41.991
-You heard of them? -Yeah, who hasn’t?

1:06:42.058 --> 1:06:45.194
Word is Siringo and Horn killed Elzy Lay and

1:06:45.261 --> 1:06:47.063
Maude Davis at the Hole in the Wall.

1:06:47.930 --> 1:06:49.599
Who told you all this?

1:06:49.665 --> 1:06:52.435
There’s an old fella in the town of Cody keeps me

1:06:52.501 --> 1:06:54.770
informed of things, seeing as how the town

1:06:54.837 --> 1:06:56.439
is just yonder of the Hole in the Wall.

1:06:56.505 --> 1:06:59.041
And I’m sorry to keep on as such,

1:06:59.108 --> 1:07:00.509
but I don’t know if you heard about what they did

1:07:00.576 --> 1:07:02.678
to Isom back in Dubois.

1:07:02.745 --> 1:07:04.113
What about Isom?

1:07:04.180 --> 1:07:06.015
Siringo and Horn dragged him out of his cell

1:07:06.082 --> 1:07:09.752
asking questions about you.

1:07:09.819 --> 1:07:11.887
Isom wouldn’t give anything up.

1:07:11.954 --> 1:07:14.023
Horn shot him dead. Cold blood.

1:07:16.993 --> 1:07:20.196
Heard old Bob Meeks had a hand in it, too.

1:07:20.262 --> 1:07:23.132
Bob Meeks? You sure about that?

1:07:23.199 --> 1:07:26.702
From what I hear, he handed Isom right to him.

1:07:31.273 --> 1:07:34.076
You’ve been so holed up with your new ranch life,

1:07:34.143 --> 1:07:35.711
you don’t even know what’s going on

1:07:35.778 --> 1:07:36.912
out there in the world, do you?

1:07:38.581 --> 1:07:41.917
You need to be looking over your shoulder from now on, Butch.

1:07:41.984 --> 1:07:43.953
But if you need anything,

1:07:44.020 --> 1:07:46.122
you know where to find Etta and me.

1:07:47.757 --> 1:07:48.891
Alice.

1:08:17.553 --> 1:08:18.854
Mrs. Cassidy.

1:08:28.030 --> 1:08:30.566
Is there by any chance, anyone with you?

1:08:30.633 --> 1:08:32.802
If you’re with the U.S. Marshal’s office,

1:08:32.868 --> 1:08:36.605
I got the paperwork there.

1:08:36.672 --> 1:08:39.975
Now leave me alone. You ain’t taking my land.

1:08:40.042 --> 1:08:43.145
We’re not here about your land, ma’am.

1:08:43.212 --> 1:08:46.382
We’re with the Pinkerton Detective Agency

1:08:46.449 --> 1:08:49.652
and we’re looking for a known fugitive.

1:08:49.719 --> 1:08:51.253
[gasps]

1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:56.425
A fugitive we were told by a reliable source was here.

1:08:57.526 --> 1:08:58.694
Who?

1:08:58.761 --> 1:09:00.196
Butch.

1:09:01.797 --> 1:09:03.365
Cassidy.

1:09:05.501 --> 1:09:09.205
Butch Cassidy, the bank robber?

1:09:11.140 --> 1:09:14.376
Same last name, gentlemen, but no relation.

1:09:14.443 --> 1:09:17.246
Yes, yes, we know that,

1:09:17.313 --> 1:09:21.016
but are you expecting him anytime soon?

1:09:21.083 --> 1:09:22.985
I don’t. Why would I?

1:09:23.052 --> 1:09:24.887
Then tell us where we can find him.

1:09:26.255 --> 1:09:29.592
I think I already answered that question.

1:09:29.658 --> 1:09:32.228
Mrs. Cassidy...

1:09:32.294 --> 1:09:35.097
Just tell us where we can find him, ma’am,

1:09:35.164 --> 1:09:36.632
and we’ll be on our way.

1:09:36.699 --> 1:09:37.833
Don’t...

1:09:39.135 --> 1:09:41.570
Please don’t make this difficult.

1:09:43.806 --> 1:09:46.342
Is this what you detectives do now?

1:09:46.408 --> 1:09:48.611
Come into little old ladies homes,

1:09:48.677 --> 1:09:52.248
a huffing and a puffing and making up stories

1:09:52.314 --> 1:09:54.984
that make you feel bigger than you really are?

1:10:00.489 --> 1:10:01.857
Huffing and puffing.

1:10:05.661 --> 1:10:06.962
Have you ever heard of a man

1:10:07.029 --> 1:10:10.599
named Elmer McCurdy, Mrs. Cassidy?

1:10:10.666 --> 1:10:16.172
No, I ain’t heard of him neither. Excuse me.

1:10:18.274 --> 1:10:20.442
Would either one of you gentlemen

1:10:20.509 --> 1:10:22.645
like some tea or coffee?

1:10:22.711 --> 1:10:24.413
No, ma’am.

1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:27.116
Coffee, Please.

1:10:27.183 --> 1:10:28.818
Well, truth be told,

1:10:28.884 --> 1:10:31.453
I’d be surprised if you said you had heard of him.

1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:37.293
Elma McCurdy was a lowlife bank and train robber,

1:10:37.359 --> 1:10:40.196
much like your Butch, in fact.

1:10:40.262 --> 1:10:42.464
Though not nearly as well known.

1:10:42.531 --> 1:10:48.470
And as is the usual fate of men in McCurdy’s chosen profession,

1:10:48.537 --> 1:10:53.542
the day came that he was shot down in the street

1:10:53.609 --> 1:10:59.348
like a rabid dog in a violent gunfight with the law.

1:11:01.450 --> 1:11:02.618
Justice served.

1:11:04.386 --> 1:11:06.422
Then the strangest thing happened.

1:11:07.957 --> 1:11:10.659
A man arrived in town professing to be

1:11:10.726 --> 1:11:14.096
McCurdy’s long lost brother.

1:11:14.163 --> 1:11:17.967
Identified him as such, claimed the body.

1:11:18.033 --> 1:11:20.469
Took it away.

1:11:20.536 --> 1:11:25.107
Ah, but it was soon learned that man had lied

1:11:25.174 --> 1:11:29.178
because, in fact, McCurdy had no brother.

1:11:30.446 --> 1:11:34.283
And that stranger, he was, in fact...

1:11:36.352 --> 1:11:40.055
the owner of a little traveling carnival show.

1:11:40.122 --> 1:11:45.861
You know, the kind that likes to put on display

1:11:45.928 --> 1:11:49.732
dead outlaw’s mummified remains.

1:11:49.798 --> 1:11:54.870
Gruesome business, but no doubt a profitable one

1:11:54.937 --> 1:11:57.273
for that little traveling show.

1:11:57.339 --> 1:12:01.744
But as a mother, I’m sure you’ll agree,

1:12:01.810 --> 1:12:06.548
such an undignified end to the life of young Elmer McCurdy.

1:12:06.615 --> 1:12:11.787
I cannot imagine how...

1:12:11.854 --> 1:12:15.691
ashamed and heartbroken

1:12:15.758 --> 1:12:17.860
his mother must have been

1:12:17.927 --> 1:12:20.629
when she found out about all that.

1:12:20.696 --> 1:12:24.300
Tell me, Mrs. Cassidy,

1:12:24.366 --> 1:12:29.405
do you like. carnival attractions?

1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:32.374
No,

1:12:34.877 --> 1:12:36.612
I don’t.

1:12:37.713 --> 1:12:39.181
Ah!

1:12:42.117 --> 1:12:47.756
Now, if you’ll excuse me, gentlemen.

1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:53.329
Mr. Horn.

1:13:01.003 --> 1:13:03.305
[gunshot]

1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:33.302
Oh!

1:13:35.004 --> 1:13:37.573
Alice! Alice! Are you all right?

1:13:37.639 --> 1:13:38.707
What happened?

1:13:41.810 --> 1:13:44.046
This is all my fault.

1:13:46.448 --> 1:13:48.217
No...

1:13:56.191 --> 1:13:58.160
I love you with all my heart.

1:15:46.368 --> 1:15:48.770
Hey. Who’s there?

1:15:51.006 --> 1:15:52.674
Answer me.

1:15:55.177 --> 1:15:56.778
Show yourself.

1:16:06.722 --> 1:16:08.790
Mike?

1:16:08.857 --> 1:16:10.559
I watched you die out there, Mike.

1:16:14.196 --> 1:16:15.964
I get that, son.

1:16:17.032 --> 1:16:18.400
And you better get this.

1:16:18.467 --> 1:16:22.638
Charlie Siringo didn’t want me. He wanted you.

1:16:22.704 --> 1:16:26.074
Alice never forgave herself for not stopping you that day.

1:16:26.141 --> 1:16:27.643
Not stopping the both of us.

1:16:29.211 --> 1:16:31.813
Her thinking that you were dead...

1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:35.651
I watched her die a little bit every single day.

1:16:35.717 --> 1:16:36.685
Blaming herself.

1:16:36.752 --> 1:16:40.856
And laying on the street dying, almost...

1:16:40.923 --> 1:16:43.225
bleeding.

1:16:43.292 --> 1:16:46.662
I was sharp enough to give him an alias

1:16:46.728 --> 1:16:51.500
so he couldn’t track me back to you and her.

1:16:51.567 --> 1:16:54.203
I’m not sure they believe me.

1:16:54.269 --> 1:16:55.737
They didn’t think I was reliable.

1:16:55.804 --> 1:16:58.941
So you know what they did? Lock him up.

1:16:59.007 --> 1:17:03.946
Put him in the goddamn prison. Five years. I did my time, son.

1:17:05.414 --> 1:17:07.416
Three weeks ago, they let me out.

1:17:07.482 --> 1:17:12.254
I was still afraid that Siringo

1:17:12.321 --> 1:17:14.890
would follow me to you.

1:17:14.957 --> 1:17:17.526
Siringo still killed Alice, didn’t he?

1:17:19.261 --> 1:17:20.629
Yes.

1:17:23.966 --> 1:17:26.668
So why are you here now?

1:17:26.735 --> 1:17:31.940
I regretted never being able to go back to her.

1:17:32.007 --> 1:17:33.709
To hold her, to comfort her.

1:17:33.775 --> 1:17:38.380
I let her down. That’s on me.

1:17:40.949 --> 1:17:44.019
You still ain’t answered my question.

1:17:44.086 --> 1:17:46.788
Why are you here?

1:17:46.855 --> 1:17:51.093
You’re the same kid as you were when you were real young.

1:17:51.159 --> 1:17:52.961
Turd-headed big time.

1:17:53.028 --> 1:17:55.130
You can get it done.

1:17:55.197 --> 1:17:57.266
You still in love with that.

1:17:57.332 --> 1:18:00.269
That’ll get you one day or another.

1:18:00.335 --> 1:18:02.404
You go after Siringo by yourself,

1:18:02.471 --> 1:18:03.872
you know what’s going to happen?

1:18:03.939 --> 1:18:05.440
You’re going to end up just exactly like me.

1:18:05.507 --> 1:18:07.976
You’ll be in prison. You’ll do time.

1:18:09.144 --> 1:18:11.213
And if that doesn’t happen,

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:15.584
he will find you and you will be dead.

1:18:16.785 --> 1:18:18.754
That’s a chance I’m willing to take.

1:18:20.289 --> 1:18:21.790
So are you with me or not?

1:18:26.194 --> 1:18:28.163
No, son. I’m not.

1:18:28.230 --> 1:18:30.332
You’re going to let them get away with it?

1:18:31.700 --> 1:18:34.369
They took Alice from us.

1:18:34.436 --> 1:18:36.238
Yes, they did.

1:18:36.305 --> 1:18:39.107
I’ll handle it again myself.

1:18:39.174 --> 1:18:40.876
Just like I did in Sweetwater.

1:18:56.525 --> 1:18:58.126
Who’s there?

1:19:03.298 --> 1:19:05.000
Reckon I might find you here.

1:19:07.235 --> 1:19:08.670
Where’s Ben and Laura?

1:19:08.737 --> 1:19:10.472
Away.

1:19:12.207 --> 1:19:14.676
Who’s that there?

1:19:14.743 --> 1:19:18.013
Some fellow thought he could cross me.

1:19:18.080 --> 1:19:20.916
A couple of Pinkerton detectives are looking for us.

1:19:22.818 --> 1:19:25.120
Ain’t nothing can’t be handled.

1:19:25.187 --> 1:19:26.588
I wanted to see if you and the others

1:19:26.655 --> 1:19:28.857
were up for another job.

1:19:28.924 --> 1:19:31.059
Yeah, like last time with your pal, Bob?

1:19:31.126 --> 1:19:32.427
No, thank you.

1:19:32.494 --> 1:19:33.995
Siringo and Horn are coming for us

1:19:34.062 --> 1:19:37.065
and they ain’t going to stop until they kill us.

1:19:37.132 --> 1:19:39.501
I say we get to them first.

1:19:39.568 --> 1:19:42.471
Rob the Southern Rail down in Folsom.

1:19:42.537 --> 1:19:45.073
Ambush and kill them at the same time.

1:19:45.140 --> 1:19:47.709
What happened to your no killing rule?

1:19:50.445 --> 1:19:52.514
They tortured Isom before killing him.

1:19:53.715 --> 1:19:56.051
Bob Meeks had a hand in that too.

1:19:56.118 --> 1:19:58.387
Where did you hear this?

1:19:58.453 --> 1:20:01.623
Outlaw I ran into. Calls himself Sundance.

1:20:01.690 --> 1:20:03.291
Never heard of him.

1:20:03.358 --> 1:20:06.461
They killed Elzy and Maude. They murdered Alice.

1:20:09.598 --> 1:20:11.500
They killed Alice?

1:20:13.135 --> 1:20:16.972
They left a note telling me that I couldn’t hide from ’em

1:20:17.038 --> 1:20:20.175
and I’m gonna kill ’em with or without you.

1:20:20.242 --> 1:20:21.643
Let me see your gun.

1:20:36.825 --> 1:20:39.127
So you really got it in you to do this?

1:20:39.194 --> 1:20:41.163
I’ve never raised my gun to kill a man,

1:20:41.229 --> 1:20:45.000
but I’d shoot the devil between the eyes if I could.

1:20:45.066 --> 1:20:48.203
The Great Train robber Butch Cassidy out for revenge.

1:20:48.270 --> 1:20:50.505
I like that.

1:20:50.572 --> 1:20:54.142
You can’t let them get away for what they did to Alice.

1:20:54.209 --> 1:20:55.377
But how do you know they’re going

1:20:55.444 --> 1:20:57.345
to show up at the train station?

1:20:57.412 --> 1:20:59.714
There’s a banker at the Wyoming National Bank

1:20:59.781 --> 1:21:03.285
in Dubois, handled all of Mike and Alice’s affairs.

1:21:03.351 --> 1:21:05.153
Mine, too. Fred.

1:21:06.822 --> 1:21:08.190
He’s a good man.

1:21:08.256 --> 1:21:10.025
He won’t readily give anything up to him,

1:21:10.091 --> 1:21:12.461
but we’ve all heard of Horn’s methods

1:21:12.527 --> 1:21:15.096
on getting fellows to talk.

1:21:15.163 --> 1:21:17.232
Except for Isom.

1:21:17.299 --> 1:21:19.768
So how do you know they’re going to go to the bank?

1:21:19.835 --> 1:21:22.103
Because that note they left me

1:21:22.170 --> 1:21:25.974
written on one of Alice’s property papers from the bank.

1:21:26.041 --> 1:21:29.911
Fred gives up the location of my ranch, which he definitely will,

1:21:29.978 --> 1:21:31.580
I’ll make sure to leave something there for them

1:21:31.646 --> 1:21:33.949
that’ll lead them straight to Folsom.

1:21:35.884 --> 1:21:39.154
Whether they show up or not, you can have all the money.

1:21:42.057 --> 1:21:44.392
All right.

1:21:44.459 --> 1:21:48.196
You let him go, let’s you and I get to it.

1:21:48.263 --> 1:21:50.565
He ain’t going nowhere. He’s counting worms.

1:21:51.500 --> 1:21:53.802
Come on, I’ll take you to them.

1:22:06.414 --> 1:22:08.083
[grunts]

1:22:15.156 --> 1:22:18.827
Please. I don’t understand. What have I done, detectives?

1:22:23.632 --> 1:22:25.567
Is that blood?

1:22:25.634 --> 1:22:28.637
Now Butch Cassidy

1:22:28.703 --> 1:22:31.206
came into your bank here

1:22:31.273 --> 1:22:32.707
with Alice Cassidy,

1:22:32.774 --> 1:22:35.911
and they had you forge that document.

1:22:35.977 --> 1:22:38.513
I’m sorry. He threatened me.

1:22:38.580 --> 1:22:39.714
-I was afraid he was-- -[thud]

1:22:39.781 --> 1:22:41.516
Ah! I was afraid he was going to kill me.

1:22:41.583 --> 1:22:43.685
That’s not the way he works.

1:22:43.752 --> 1:22:45.954
You and I both know that, don’t we?

1:22:47.422 --> 1:22:51.393
Now, you’re not in trouble for the forged document.

1:22:51.459 --> 1:22:55.997
You sold some land at Butch Cassidy a while back.

1:22:56.064 --> 1:22:58.900
I did. But that was a perfectly legal transaction.

1:22:58.967 --> 1:23:00.201
Where’s it located?

1:23:03.471 --> 1:23:07.275
Where the road comes to a fork.

1:23:07.342 --> 1:23:10.078
Alice Cassidy’s house is on the eastern trail, right?

1:23:10.145 --> 1:23:15.083
So, Butch Cassidy’s house is off the western.

1:23:15.150 --> 1:23:17.285
It’s called the Bartlet Ranch.

1:23:17.352 --> 1:23:21.389
You follow the western trail around down through some

1:23:21.456 --> 1:23:24.125
small hills, and it sits at the base amongst the trees.

1:23:25.026 --> 1:23:26.661
It’s a small house.

1:23:27.862 --> 1:23:29.230
You can’t miss it.

1:23:29.297 --> 1:23:31.333
You wouldn’t lie to us, would you?

1:23:33.635 --> 1:23:36.871
No, sir. Absolutely not.

1:23:36.938 --> 1:23:38.940
I would consider him a friend, but...

1:23:40.308 --> 1:23:42.911
Sometimes you have to think about yourself, right?

1:23:43.778 --> 1:23:45.580
One last thing, sir.

1:23:45.647 --> 1:23:48.950
Do you happen to know if Butch Cassidy

1:23:49.017 --> 1:23:52.921
has any company right now?

1:23:54.289 --> 1:23:56.825
Every time I’ve seen him, he’s always

1:23:56.891 --> 1:23:59.194
been in the presence of Alice.

1:24:00.495 --> 1:24:02.397
Sirs...

1:24:02.464 --> 1:24:06.868
Whose blood is on the paper?

1:24:06.935 --> 1:24:09.270
Just be thankful that it isn’t yours.

1:24:11.473 --> 1:24:12.874
Appreciate your help.

1:24:22.917 --> 1:24:24.586
We riding out to Cassidy’s place?

1:24:24.653 --> 1:24:26.187
Not just yet.

1:24:26.254 --> 1:24:29.190
Let’s pay a little visit to Sheriff Beck.

1:24:29.257 --> 1:24:32.894
See if he and his men can atone for their sins.

1:24:42.103 --> 1:24:43.471
Please, don’t shoot.

1:24:43.538 --> 1:24:46.474
Not to worry, ma’am. We mean you no harm.

1:24:46.541 --> 1:24:50.045
We’re looking for a known fugitive. Butch Cassidy.

1:24:50.111 --> 1:24:54.082
This... This is his residence, is it not?

1:24:54.949 --> 1:24:57.552
Robert Parker lives here.

1:24:57.619 --> 1:25:00.989
Mr. Parker and Mr. Cassidy are one and the same.

1:25:02.791 --> 1:25:05.694
I did not know that.

1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:08.496
-So is he inside? -No, he’s not.

1:25:11.833 --> 1:25:13.468
Move aside, ma’am.

1:25:14.769 --> 1:25:16.337
Step down for me.

1:25:22.644 --> 1:25:24.546
What is your name?

1:25:24.612 --> 1:25:26.915
Ethel. Ethel Porter.

1:25:26.981 --> 1:25:31.486
You don’t mind me asking, what is your relationship to Butch?

1:25:31.553 --> 1:25:34.022
Or should I say Mr. Parker.

1:25:36.658 --> 1:25:38.526
House is empty.

1:25:40.862 --> 1:25:42.430
Your relationship, ma’am?

1:25:42.497 --> 1:25:46.634
He’s my neighbor. I live over yonder.

1:25:46.701 --> 1:25:48.203
We met a while back.

1:25:48.269 --> 1:25:51.973
He asked me to look in on the place and tidy up a bit.

1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:53.775
And do his laundry?

1:25:55.176 --> 1:25:57.212
That’s neighborly of you.

1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:01.182
Did he happen to mention where he went?

1:26:01.249 --> 1:26:03.718
He was riding on down to Folsom

1:26:03.785 --> 1:26:05.220
to meet up with some old friends.

1:26:07.789 --> 1:26:09.324
Don’t move.

1:26:12.994 --> 1:26:15.530
-Do you believe her? -I do.

1:26:15.597 --> 1:26:18.433
Only because the Southern Pacific Railroad

1:26:18.500 --> 1:26:21.936
stops there to distribute payroll.

1:26:22.003 --> 1:26:24.706
to the rail construction sites.

1:26:24.773 --> 1:26:27.208
That would be a big take for them.

1:26:27.275 --> 1:26:30.945
And she mentioned he was meeting up with old friends.

1:26:32.180 --> 1:26:33.681
It could be Curry and his crew.

1:26:33.748 --> 1:26:35.316
Very well could be.

1:26:35.383 --> 1:26:38.453
Which means we’re going to need a little help.

1:26:42.157 --> 1:26:43.558
Am I in trouble, sirs?

1:26:43.625 --> 1:26:44.893
No, ma’am, you’re not.

1:26:44.959 --> 1:26:46.995
Thank you for the information.

1:26:48.163 --> 1:26:52.300
Oh, just a little suggestion.

1:26:53.935 --> 1:26:58.506
I strongly advise you not to fraternize with no criminals.

1:26:58.573 --> 1:27:03.578
It’s not particularly good for your health.

1:27:08.817 --> 1:27:10.285
Good day.

1:27:14.589 --> 1:27:16.291
[chuckles]

1:27:42.617 --> 1:27:45.053
Looks like they fell for it.

1:27:47.589 --> 1:27:48.656
You okay, darlin’?

1:27:48.723 --> 1:27:50.525
Yeah.

1:27:50.592 --> 1:27:52.594
Come here, come here.

1:27:52.660 --> 1:27:53.595
I’m here.

1:27:54.963 --> 1:27:56.364
I’m here. What happened?

1:28:00.001 --> 1:28:03.004
I for sure thought Butch was wrong about

1:28:03.071 --> 1:28:05.340
two lawmen killing Alice Cassidy, but...

1:28:07.475 --> 1:28:08.810
Now I believe him.

1:28:08.877 --> 1:28:10.411
Yeah, and they’re gonna get

1:28:10.478 --> 1:28:13.548
what’s coming to ’em, I promise you.

1:28:13.615 --> 1:28:16.184
But now I got to go saddle up and let Butch know

1:28:16.251 --> 1:28:19.787
-they’re on their way. -I don’t want you to go.

1:28:19.854 --> 1:28:22.891
-Why? -I just don’t trust it.

1:28:22.957 --> 1:28:25.593
You wanted me to help Butch out in the first place.

1:28:25.660 --> 1:28:28.796
I know, I know, but you didn’t see them.

1:28:28.863 --> 1:28:30.398
They have a devil in their eyes.

1:28:32.333 --> 1:28:34.202
I’ve seen them. I’ve seen them.

1:28:37.605 --> 1:28:39.040
I just don’t...

1:28:39.107 --> 1:28:41.476
I don’t want you getting killed over his personal vendetta...

1:28:42.911 --> 1:28:46.681
No matter how wrong it was them killing Alice Cassidy.

1:28:49.183 --> 1:28:50.351
I just don’t trust it.

1:28:50.418 --> 1:28:51.986
I know. I know you don’t.

1:28:54.522 --> 1:28:56.557
But I’m not a fan of giving someone my word

1:28:56.624 --> 1:28:59.227
and not following through on it, Etta.

1:29:00.161 --> 1:29:03.064
We may need his help one day.

1:29:07.001 --> 1:29:09.170
I’ll come back to you.

1:29:11.472 --> 1:29:14.008
[bell ringing]

1:29:19.614 --> 1:29:20.615
Bank guards.

1:29:20.682 --> 1:29:22.250
Yeah, I see ’em.

1:29:22.317 --> 1:29:24.085
I don’t see Sundance.

1:29:25.687 --> 1:29:26.854
Don’t need him, anyway.

1:29:26.921 --> 1:29:28.489
Horn and Siringo show, there’s four of us.

1:29:28.556 --> 1:29:30.358
I like them odds.

1:29:32.093 --> 1:29:34.195
That’s a good score.

1:29:40.468 --> 1:29:42.103
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1:29:44.272 --> 1:29:45.473
We’ll take it from here.

1:29:49.577 --> 1:29:53.214
I’d drop those guns to the ground. Nice and slow.

1:29:53.281 --> 1:29:54.549
Nice and slow.

1:29:55.783 --> 1:29:56.751
Good.

1:29:59.921 --> 1:30:01.289
Get out of here.

1:30:03.157 --> 1:30:05.293
[laughing]

1:30:06.928 --> 1:30:08.796
Ooh-wee.

1:30:13.201 --> 1:30:14.802
Where are these Pinkertons?

1:30:14.869 --> 1:30:16.537
If they ain’t here by the time that money’s loaded up,

1:30:16.604 --> 1:30:18.306
Butch, you’re on your own.

1:30:18.373 --> 1:30:20.341
We’re here for the money. You’re here for revenge.

1:30:25.947 --> 1:30:27.749
[trains whistle blows]

1:30:33.755 --> 1:30:35.957
[grunts]

1:30:36.024 --> 1:30:37.625
This is heavy.

1:30:51.039 --> 1:30:52.273
[gunfire]

1:31:09.223 --> 1:31:10.691
[horse whinnies]

1:31:12.026 --> 1:31:13.594
[grunts]

1:31:27.775 --> 1:31:28.876
Whoa.

1:31:33.848 --> 1:31:36.217
[gunfire continues]

1:32:01.709 --> 1:32:02.743
[grunts]

1:32:18.059 --> 1:32:20.228
Ah!

1:32:20.294 --> 1:32:21.829
I’ve been shot!

1:32:26.734 --> 1:32:28.503
Get over here.

1:32:33.474 --> 1:32:35.343
Die, you son of a bitch.

1:32:35.409 --> 1:32:36.878
-No. -What are you doing?

1:32:36.944 --> 1:32:38.579
I told you I want him alive.

1:32:38.646 --> 1:32:40.715
You shoot that girl, you’re going to jail with ’em.

1:32:40.781 --> 1:32:42.316
Do you understand me, Mr. Horn?

1:32:42.383 --> 1:32:44.418
Drop that gun or I’ll put a bullet

1:32:44.485 --> 1:32:45.653
in this little girl’s head.

1:32:46.521 --> 1:32:47.822
Put ’em down.

1:32:47.889 --> 1:32:49.357
Son of a bitch.

1:32:52.693 --> 1:32:53.661
Butch!

1:32:54.662 --> 1:32:56.330
He’s not gonna shoot.

1:33:05.606 --> 1:33:07.475
-[grunting] -Butch!

1:33:15.816 --> 1:33:17.752
[laughing]

1:33:17.818 --> 1:33:18.753
Don’t you do it.

1:33:21.088 --> 1:33:22.990
Don’t!

1:33:23.057 --> 1:33:24.659
Oh, shit!

1:33:28.362 --> 1:33:29.931
I got him. I got him.

1:33:34.402 --> 1:33:35.903
Butch, get out of here, go.

1:33:35.970 --> 1:33:38.172
I ain’t leaving you.

1:33:38.239 --> 1:33:41.142
You’re worth more to us alive than dead, Butch.

1:33:41.209 --> 1:33:42.376
We’ll get ’em another day.

1:33:42.443 --> 1:33:44.512
-Go. -I ain’t leaving you.

1:33:45.780 --> 1:33:46.781
Go on. Get.

1:33:47.848 --> 1:33:48.849
-Go! -Go.

1:33:50.551 --> 1:33:52.353
I’ll draw him away from us, all right?

1:33:57.758 --> 1:33:59.660
[groans]

1:33:59.727 --> 1:34:01.529
No, I’ll handle this.

1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:07.401
[gunfire]

1:34:14.642 --> 1:34:17.378
Take that hand off your wound and raise it up.

1:34:22.283 --> 1:34:24.552
Do you think you can get it?

1:34:28.689 --> 1:34:30.424
Get your back up against the wall.

1:34:32.059 --> 1:34:32.994
Now get.

1:34:36.964 --> 1:34:40.434
Sheriff Beck, retrieve their guns.

1:34:48.042 --> 1:34:51.512
-What about these three? -They’re not going anywhere.

1:34:51.579 --> 1:34:54.782
Sheriff Beck, watch them, if you please.

1:35:09.630 --> 1:35:10.831
Where the hell were you?

1:35:10.898 --> 1:35:11.832
With Etta.

1:35:11.899 --> 1:35:14.635
-Is she okay? -She’s fine.

1:35:15.836 --> 1:35:16.837
[gunshot]

1:35:16.904 --> 1:35:18.339
Ah!

1:35:22.843 --> 1:35:24.612
-I got him. -They shot me.

1:35:24.679 --> 1:35:26.380
Come on. Come on. Get up.

1:35:27.581 --> 1:35:28.916
Well, well, well.

1:35:28.983 --> 1:35:31.819
Look at this. This is a most prosperous day.

1:35:31.886 --> 1:35:34.555
Two of the most dangerous outlaws in the West

1:35:34.622 --> 1:35:36.991
at the same time.

1:35:37.058 --> 1:35:38.559
Only difference between the two of you and us

1:35:38.626 --> 1:35:40.494
is them fake badges you wear.

1:35:40.561 --> 1:35:42.763
Tie them up, Mr. Horn.

1:35:42.830 --> 1:35:45.366
-Give me your hands. -Stop.

1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:48.336
Holster that gun, Mr. Siringo.

1:35:48.402 --> 1:35:50.071
Or you’re a dead man.

1:35:50.137 --> 1:35:52.473
Oh, you wouldn’t like her when she’s mad.

1:35:57.445 --> 1:35:58.646
Drop them, boys.

1:36:03.751 --> 1:36:06.354
Thought you two could need a little help.

1:36:06.420 --> 1:36:08.422
Turns out I was right.

1:36:08.489 --> 1:36:10.224
That’s my girl.

1:36:10.291 --> 1:36:12.326
I told you she was lying to us.

1:36:12.393 --> 1:36:14.095
I heard about your methods, Horn.

1:36:15.329 --> 1:36:16.831
Is it you who killed Alice?

1:36:19.266 --> 1:36:20.601
Yes.

1:36:22.002 --> 1:36:25.539
But if it’s any consolation to you,

1:36:25.606 --> 1:36:28.309
at least she died with some dignity.

1:36:28.376 --> 1:36:31.445
Unlike your yellow belly friends.

1:36:31.512 --> 1:36:35.483
Ellsworth, Maude and Isom Dart.

1:36:35.549 --> 1:36:36.851
She was shot in the back.

1:36:38.386 --> 1:36:39.954
What difference does it make?

1:36:40.020 --> 1:36:41.722
She was just another filthy whore

1:36:41.789 --> 1:36:44.458
that had what was coming to her.

1:36:56.103 --> 1:36:58.939
Well, so much for the legend that you never killed a man.

1:36:59.006 --> 1:37:02.042
Now question is, what do we do with Detective Siringo here?

1:37:04.378 --> 1:37:06.647
Is it true what Horn said?

1:37:06.714 --> 1:37:07.681
You didn’t have nothing to do with

1:37:07.748 --> 1:37:09.283
killing Alice or them others?

1:37:09.350 --> 1:37:10.818
Don’t matter, Butch.

1:37:10.885 --> 1:37:13.287
He used Horn. He’s got just as much blood

1:37:13.354 --> 1:37:17.024
on his hands even if he didn’t pull the trigger.

1:37:17.091 --> 1:37:18.592
I say we kill him right now and be done with it.

1:37:18.659 --> 1:37:20.661
No, no, no.

1:37:20.728 --> 1:37:22.396
Take off your belt, Mr. Siringo.

1:37:22.463 --> 1:37:24.432
-Nice and slow. -What? Why?

1:37:24.498 --> 1:37:26.801
-Then what? -We tie him up.

1:37:26.867 --> 1:37:28.068
And then what, Butch?

1:37:38.179 --> 1:37:39.780
What the hell did you do?

1:37:39.847 --> 1:37:42.583
He’s going for his holdout gun.

1:37:42.650 --> 1:37:44.084
It was either us or them, Butch.

1:37:44.151 --> 1:37:46.086
And good damn riddance.

1:37:46.153 --> 1:37:48.022
Nothing but a bunch of filthy cockroaches.

1:37:48.088 --> 1:37:49.190
The both of them.

1:37:49.256 --> 1:37:51.192
He’s a Pinkerton detective, Sundance.

1:37:51.258 --> 1:37:54.195
Only gonna have more coming looking for us now.

1:37:54.261 --> 1:37:56.330
Well, then we better get going now, shouldn’t we?

1:37:56.397 --> 1:37:58.332
What about all that money from the Folsom train?

1:37:58.399 --> 1:38:00.801
Back at the station.

1:38:00.868 --> 1:38:03.003
You didn’t even get the damn loot?

1:38:03.070 --> 1:38:05.105
There’s no way I could have loaded it up on my horse,

1:38:05.172 --> 1:38:07.475
all them bullets flying.

1:38:07.541 --> 1:38:11.278
Well, it’d be kind of a shame to leave all that money behind.

1:38:12.446 --> 1:38:14.215
We can go back and get it.

1:38:14.281 --> 1:38:15.683
Now we’re making sense.

1:38:18.853 --> 1:38:20.888
Thank you for saving the day, darling.

1:38:38.606 --> 1:38:40.541
Whoa.

1:38:45.479 --> 1:38:47.181
Put that down.

1:38:53.821 --> 1:38:55.756
I’m sorry.

1:38:55.823 --> 1:38:57.691
Charlie Siringo threatened to kill all of us

1:38:57.758 --> 1:38:58.926
if we didn’t help him.

1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:15.342
You go on and get out of here. Make sure I don’t see you again.

1:39:25.986 --> 1:39:27.721
Didn’t think you’d come back for us.

1:39:28.923 --> 1:39:30.057
Yeah, I came back.

1:39:30.124 --> 1:39:32.726
Let’s get you on our of here now.

1:39:32.793 --> 1:39:33.994
Let’s get out share of the loot and split up

1:39:34.061 --> 1:39:36.063
before any more of the law shows up.

1:39:39.967 --> 1:39:42.136
What about Siringo and Horn?

1:39:42.202 --> 1:39:43.437
Counting worms.

1:39:43.504 --> 1:39:45.773
Killed ’em?

1:39:45.839 --> 1:39:47.875
You don’t got to worry about them no more.

1:40:07.394 --> 1:40:09.129
Your take.

1:40:11.799 --> 1:40:14.435
What? That’s it?

1:40:14.501 --> 1:40:18.138
Come on, fellas. The three of us make a pretty good bunch.

1:40:19.239 --> 1:40:21.275
Yeah, I reckon.

1:40:23.077 --> 1:40:24.345
Did you want to come with me?

1:40:26.547 --> 1:40:29.149
I mean, it’s not a bad idea.

1:40:29.216 --> 1:40:30.551
It’s only a matter of time

1:40:30.618 --> 1:40:32.252
before the law comes looking for us.

1:40:32.319 --> 1:40:33.520
Yeah.

1:40:33.587 --> 1:40:35.489
They’re going to find our home sooner or later.

1:40:35.556 --> 1:40:36.957
True.

1:40:37.024 --> 1:40:40.427
They might even be waiting for us when we get back.

1:40:43.230 --> 1:40:44.965
This ain’t going to get us too far.

1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.167
Yeah, we’ll probably have

1:40:47.234 --> 1:40:49.336
to pull a few more jobs along the way.

1:40:51.238 --> 1:40:53.040
You up for it?

1:40:56.610 --> 1:40:58.479
Oh, yeah.

1:40:58.545 --> 1:40:59.880
Well, you know I’m in.

1:41:01.815 --> 1:41:03.283
Let’s ride.
