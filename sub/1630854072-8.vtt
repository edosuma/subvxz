00:16.307 --> 00:17.892
Director Evans.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.895
What-- What the hell? How long
have you been standing there?

00:20.979 --> 00:24.607
My apologies, sir.
I did knock a few times.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.527
It's alright. Tell me what it is you need.

00:28.361 --> 00:32.449
It's getting late.
May I go home for the day?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.201
My apologies.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.537
I ask ony because I have plans
for the evening.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.374
Shall I adjust all our deadlines
to accommodate your personal schedule?

00:41.458 --> 00:44.294
No, sir. It's just…

00:44.377 --> 00:47.964
My son got into the Academy.
I… I wanted to surprise him.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.425
Delightful. Another legacy hire.

00:50.508 --> 00:53.011
Please extend my congratulations.

00:53.094 --> 00:56.931
Find someone to fetch the UG2 sample
and you are free to go.

00:57.015 --> 01:00.310
But at this hour, they've all gone home.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.774
It's no problem, sir.
I'll grab the sample myself.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.984
How very kind of you.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.279
Fetch it and then get out of my sight.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.542
Uh… Director Evans, I, uh…

01:34.010 --> 01:35.053
But why?

01:37.388 --> 01:39.808
Hm?

01:42.644 --> 01:44.938
What happened in there?

01:46.022 --> 01:49.275
Lost you for a sec.
Someone raise a jammer?

01:49.359 --> 01:51.528
Hm. Connection was stable throughout.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.238
Weird.

01:53.321 --> 01:57.826
Man, oh, man.
That gig was a snore.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.464
They trespassed
on Arasaka premises.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.716
Hit us in our own fucking facility.

03:36.799 --> 03:40.553
The lab's research is focused
on Militech countermeasures.

03:40.637 --> 03:44.182
The runner who killed Jamie
and Marcus, you think it's related?

03:44.265 --> 03:46.100
Evans's head was blown off.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.062
This was sloppy, violent, guns blazing.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.481
Safe to say, not the same runner.

03:51.564 --> 03:55.735
Finding the netrunner remains
our priority. Too dangerous, that one.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.238
We know neither
their motive nor intentions.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.365
Whoever they are, they're careful.

04:00.448 --> 04:03.534
Not your average rogue runner
looking to make a name.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.453
We're Arasaka Counterintel.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.247
We never deal with average.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.375
We'll need to take a detour
to get on the netrunner's trail.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.669
Are we pursuing
Director Evans' killer?

04:12.752 --> 04:14.545
A different trail, most likely.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.006
But maybe we'll get lucky
and see them merge.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.594
Let's switch it up.
See if the fixer angle bears fruit.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.306
We'll need one of Militech's mutts.
Who do we know that's on their payroll?

04:25.390 --> 04:29.435
Checking it now. What if this fixer
has ties to our runner?

04:29.519 --> 04:33.064
What's to stop them from selling
information on the product to Militech?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.024
Higher-ups want it kept secret.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.319
All NC fixers are self-serving scoutbags.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.738
They just need a push
in the right direction.

04:40.822 --> 04:44.867
In the end, they're only glorified
corporate lapdogs existing to serve.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.537
We'll remind them
who their real masters are.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.790
They must be warned of what happens
when they bite the hand that feeds.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.042
And just how will we do this?

04:54.836 --> 04:57.922
We tell them
in the only language this city speaks.

05:01.175 --> 05:01.926
Hmm?

05:07.557 --> 05:08.933
Look out!

05:41.424 --> 05:43.217
I was very nearly killed.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.220
But Arasaka? How can you be sure?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.681
You taking me for a fool?
Who else?

05:48.765 --> 05:52.060
Even so, don't expect
a bump in hazard pay.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.520
And corporate immunity
is still off the table.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.605
What a joke!

05:55.688 --> 05:59.442
Listen, your fuckup with Tanaka
already has this operation in the red.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.611
With nothing to show for it.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.364
We expect returns on our investments.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.200
Want more resources, show us results.

06:07.283 --> 06:10.328
And what the hell do you think
I've been so busy chasing?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.455
Check your tone, Faraday.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.708
You're running out of time.
Our patience is running thin.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.337
You're aware that Arasaka's security
has been very tight.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.130
They clearly view the cyberskeleton

06:21.214 --> 06:24.133
as a market game-changer
worthy of their utmost vigilance.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.259
You ask too much.

06:25.343 --> 06:28.054
Don't lecture me. I know the stakes.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.723
We know its worth. We know yours.

06:30.807 --> 06:34.352
Not another eddie until you earn it.
We're done here.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.818
Cocky self-important brat.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.789
Fixer's made contact. As we foresaw.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.499
There's a good boy.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.127
What a mischievous little dog.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.633
<i>…tonight, so keep those optics tuned in.</i>

07:06.217 --> 07:07.468
<i>First up is a top of the line…</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:08.678
David?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.638
Huh?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.057
Oh, sorry, my bad.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.017
Did I wake you?

07:15.601 --> 07:17.061
Can't sleep?

07:17.145 --> 07:19.063
Couldn't shut my brain down.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.149
-Oh.
-I'll turn it off.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.775
Aren't you watching?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.277
No, I just kinda zoning out.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.362
-<i>Enemies outnumber…</i>
-Huh?

07:26.446 --> 07:30.324
Only 250K to the Moon?

07:30.408 --> 07:31.409
Cheaper than I thought.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.828
Only for a one-way ticket though.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.705
Yeah, true.

07:36.873 --> 07:37.915
You remembered.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.208
Huh?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.294
Hmm. I need to sleep.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.671
Okay. Goodnight, then.

07:43.754 --> 07:47.175
<i>…eurodollars. Get your one-way ticket now.</i>

07:47.258 --> 07:50.803
<i>Pick up one new case…</i>

07:51.762 --> 07:53.222
Rundown diner meetup

07:53.306 --> 07:56.058
with the counter-intel
of the world's greatest megacorp.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.896
I thought you'd find
the familiarity reassuring.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.315
Depends wholly on your answer.

08:02.398 --> 08:05.526
The cyberskeleton project
is a delicate topic,

08:05.610 --> 08:07.445
even within Arasaka.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.613
It turned problematic

08:08.696 --> 08:12.074
when Tanaka over-consolidated
the operational data.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.660
How much does Militech already know?

08:14.744 --> 08:17.288
Information is the lifeblood of my trade.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.956
So, I do not share it freely.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.374
We respect that

08:20.458 --> 08:23.503
and understand
you're the best fixer for the job.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.882
We'll gladly provide the compensation
Militech foolishly denied you.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.968
As for the Tanaka mess,
consider your debt settled.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.220
Now, I'm listening.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.598
But of course, I would
need to add a few conditions.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.475
Go on.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.976
We must eliminate

08:39.060 --> 08:42.939
any and all persons aware
of the cyberskeleton's existence.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.023
Done.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.485
-And one more thing.
-Yes?

08:47.568 --> 08:49.028
A meddlesome netrunner.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.280
Since Tanaka's death,
they have been interfering

08:51.364 --> 08:54.659
with our data recovery efforts
regarding the cyberskeleton.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.119
Do you have information on who it may be?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.248
-Afraid not.
-Unfortunate.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.000
We find this case especially curious.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.086
Even if Militech were behind it,

09:05.169 --> 09:08.339
we can't conceive of a reasonable motive.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.925
From what my sources tell me,

09:11.008 --> 09:13.344
not a single soul knows of Tanaka's ties

09:13.427 --> 09:15.346
to the cyberskeleton project.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.723
-An inside job?
-Impossible.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.769
No one in the Arasaka subnet moves
internally without leaving breadcrumbs.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.688
No. Our theory points outward.

09:23.771 --> 09:27.400
Those skills are bounty's most likely
not corporate, an edgerunner.

09:27.483 --> 09:31.153
A perfect job for a fixer,
wouldn't you agree?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.905
Is this an official contract?

09:33.531 --> 09:36.409
A cool million for bringing in
the runner alive.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.411
Half of that for just their head.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.289
We have a deal.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.543
<i>Whoa. Rare call. Butt dial?</i>
<i>Even possible on this?</i>

09:45.626 --> 09:47.378
<i>Kiwi, hey.</i>

09:47.461 --> 09:48.754
<i>What's up-up?</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:49.839
<i>No, nothing.</i>

09:49.922 --> 09:53.843
-<i>Just-just a question I need to ask.</i>
-<i>A question?</i>

09:53.926 --> 09:56.637
<i>Not like, you know. No big deal.</i>

09:56.721 --> 09:58.973
<i>Like-like how David's…</i>

09:59.056 --> 10:02.059
<i>David? Fine, he's fine. For a punk.</i>

10:02.143 --> 10:03.811
<i>Thought he'd need hand-holding, help,</i>

10:03.894 --> 10:07.648
<i>but stepped up big. Big leader. Weird.</i>

10:07.732 --> 10:10.651
<i>And Faraday, we're back on his payroll.</i>

10:10.735 --> 10:11.569
<i>Heard, yeah.</i>

10:11.652 --> 10:15.740
<i>Maine'd snap a circ,</i>
<i>zippf, if he saw David.</i>

10:15.823 --> 10:16.866
<i>Hmm.</i>

10:18.242 --> 10:20.578
<i>Some-something on your mind, Luce?</i>

10:20.661 --> 10:24.332
<i>Hmm? No, no. Like, happy</i>
<i>to hear he's holding up, 's all.</i>

10:25.166 --> 10:26.208
<i>Why call? Why? Come see him. Just--</i>

10:26.292 --> 10:27.460
<i>Huh?</i>

10:27.543 --> 10:31.756
<i>He's moping, waitin', always is.</i>
<i>You. Wants you.</i>

10:31.839 --> 10:35.051
<i>Wants you back ASAP. So-so-so obvious.</i>

10:35.134 --> 10:37.845
-<i>Yeah, I know.</i>
-<i>Still a no-no no-go?</i>

10:37.928 --> 10:40.181
<i>Nah. No, not yet.</i>

10:40.264 --> 10:43.351
<i>Got something, but can't. Just</i>
<i>gotta do it. Won't take long. Not long.</i>

10:43.434 --> 10:44.477
<i>Okay.</i>

10:45.269 --> 10:46.896
<i>Fuckin' mysterious.</i>

10:46.979 --> 10:50.149
<i>Even-even for you. Won't pry though.</i>

10:50.232 --> 10:52.443
<i>Never trust a soul in NC.</i>

10:52.526 --> 10:53.944
<i>Was me who taught you.</i>

10:54.028 --> 10:56.238
<i>You? Oh yeah.</i>
<i>Remember that.</i>

10:57.073 --> 11:00.117
<i>Look forward to having you</i>
<i>round-round again, Luce.</i>

11:00.201 --> 11:03.079
<i>Meaning, God, do we need</i>
<i>David's handler back.</i>

11:03.162 --> 11:06.582
<i>That bad, huh? Right. Later.</i>

11:09.418 --> 11:10.628
Huh?

11:11.545 --> 11:12.630
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

11:20.596 --> 11:23.265
I've got me some.
Are you ready to go around?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.184
Empty!

11:25.267 --> 11:26.268
Gotcha.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.206
The fuck was that?

11:48.332 --> 11:50.710
I, uh… My bad.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.337
Alrighty. Be seein' ya.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.338
Yeah.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.721
-Falco! Let me off too, choom!
-Huh?

12:04.807 --> 12:08.018
Well, damn, looks like a party for two.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.230
Actually, need you
to drop me somewhere too.

12:11.313 --> 12:14.483
Is that so? Pfft. Bunch of killjoys,
all of you all.

12:15.776 --> 12:16.986
Yo, David!

12:19.113 --> 12:20.740
No afterparty today?

12:20.823 --> 12:23.826
Expect me to drink alone
with those old farts?

12:23.909 --> 12:26.120
I can't promise I'll be any more fun.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.080
You underestimate yourself!

12:28.748 --> 12:30.666
You wanna take a walk?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.419
Huh? Sure.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.837
Nova!

12:36.756 --> 12:37.923
Uh…

12:38.674 --> 12:41.302
So, you been doing okay?

12:41.385 --> 12:42.261
Meaning?

12:42.344 --> 12:44.764
<i>What was that today?</i>

12:45.347 --> 12:46.515
What was what?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.684
You know exactly what I mean.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.810
Froze up, 's all.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.021
Been freezin' up a lot lately.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.523
Think I don't notice?

12:54.607 --> 12:55.441
<i>Don't walk.</i>

12:55.524 --> 12:56.484
I'm fine.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.778
-A woman's eyes can be shrewd.
-<i>Don't walk.</i>

12:58.861 --> 13:01.155
-What woman?
-Pfft. Shut up!

13:01.238 --> 13:02.531
<i>Walk.</i>

13:03.115 --> 13:07.036
You know, ain't no one
I watch as close as I watch you.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.540
Come on, David. What's the matter?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.419
-It's nothing.
-Cut the shit, please.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.171
It's not your problem, Becca.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.089
Like hell it's not.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.425
I put my life in your hands daily.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.053
I know.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.641
I've been thinking.

13:28.724 --> 13:29.725
Hmm.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.186
Go light
on your chrome for a while.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.189
Don't you worry. I've got your back!

13:36.106 --> 13:38.567
-Is that right?
-I'm being serious right now.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.113
<i>Remember the ally psycho</i>
<i>that zeroed my bro?</i>

13:44.031 --> 13:45.366
'Course.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.575
I…

13:47.243 --> 13:49.453
I can't see you end up like him.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.456
Yeah.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.867
Damn 'Saka still sending in runners?

14:38.711 --> 14:43.007
<i>…with a heart of gold and balls of steel.</i>

14:43.090 --> 14:46.051
<i>Bobby Sox suspicious dual</i>

14:50.180 --> 14:51.515

14:53.517 --> 14:56.020
<i>Security neutralized. And la-di-da.</i>

14:56.103 --> 14:57.521
<i>Door's wide-wide open.</i>

15:00.232 --> 15:03.903
Hm? What? No, no. Wait!

15:21.045 --> 15:22.671
<i>David? David, copy?</i>

15:22.755 --> 15:24.798
<i>Heat sig. You, there, not alone.</i>
<i>With someone.</i>

15:24.882 --> 15:26.550
<i>On you. Right on you.</i>

15:26.634 --> 15:28.636
<i>Get out. Out of there.</i>

15:28.719 --> 15:30.346
<i>David. Copy. Come on.</i>

15:34.600 --> 15:35.434
But why?

15:46.904 --> 15:50.157
<i>Talk to me. Talk, David, talk.</i>

15:50.240 --> 15:51.784
<i>Uh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

15:51.867 --> 15:54.411
<i>What? Deaf? Comms jam. What?</i>

15:54.495 --> 15:56.455
<i>Someone, headed straight for you.</i>

15:57.498 --> 15:59.041
<i>I handled it.</i>

15:59.124 --> 16:01.377
<i>You did? Cool. Cool. Good.</i>

16:02.962 --> 16:03.796
Leaving. On my way.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.553
<i>…and they were posing</i>
<i>as corporate lawyers…</i>

16:14.890 --> 16:16.558
<i>…needs to stop.</i>

16:18.268 --> 16:21.188
David!

16:26.527 --> 16:27.945
Morning, cupcake.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.322
Doc.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.616
Symptoms letting up a dial?

16:32.700 --> 16:33.701
Yeah.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.582
-When they start?
-What?

16:40.666 --> 16:44.586
Shaky hands, dizziness, nausea.
Usual suspects.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.047
A little while ago.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.591
Shoulda handled it the sec they appeared.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.218
Didn't seem like a big deal.

16:51.301 --> 16:54.430
All this chrome's
catching up with you, Davey.

16:54.513 --> 16:59.143
I mean, shit still blows my mind
you kept it together this long.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.103
Whatev. Why now?

17:01.186 --> 17:05.024
You want my professional opinion? You
best lift your pedal of the metal, choom.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.402
You're about to drive head-first
off the cliff with no way back up.

17:08.485 --> 17:11.113
Yeah. Just give me
fucking stronger meds, then.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.406
Well, shit.

17:12.489 --> 17:16.493
Either you ain't hearing me, choom,
or you're already off the deep end.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.996
Asking for miracle drugs and pixie dust--

17:20.748 --> 17:23.459
Listen. Didn't come here
for your golf jokes.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.252
Just take my fucking money.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.089
And give me my fucking meds.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.382
David!

17:39.683 --> 17:40.559
There.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.854
Your last kweep.
Nine times standard dosage,

17:43.937 --> 17:45.355
good for nine days.

17:45.439 --> 17:49.693
It'll send you rollin' over the edge
and straight into hell.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.739
I'm sorry, Doc. You didn't deserve that.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.950
Don't waste your breath, Davey.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.912
Not like you're ever
coming back here anyway.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.917
Just yesterday a punk kid
pushing XBDs for a quick buck.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.878
Go on. Become that legend.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.589
Or whatever the fuck you merks do.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.724
Another turn for the next dreamer.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.268
David! Wait!

18:24.311 --> 18:25.354
What was that?

18:26.021 --> 18:27.356
Don't tell the crew.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.358
I don't get it.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.072
Hey!

18:39.743 --> 18:43.956
Your body, your mind.
They have limits, David.

18:44.039 --> 18:47.501
You knew that.
If normal meds can't cut it,

18:47.584 --> 18:49.628
it's time to slow down.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.964
Can't watch you do this to yourself.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.133
Scale back your cyberware.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.135
I can't do that.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.094
Why not?

18:58.178 --> 19:02.349
Because of Maine and my mom. Both
had plans for me, left me things to do.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.435
Stuff I ain't done yet.

19:05.519 --> 19:09.690
But you really… David,
you can't go on like this.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.024
I'll be fine.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.571
Honestly believe that?
Really think you're special?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.532
<i>Handled the Sandy, didn't I?</i>

19:19.491 --> 19:20.951
<i>Definitely ain't normal.</i>

19:22.619 --> 19:26.206
So, you have a higher tolerance
than everyone else, that's all.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.293
Doesn't mean you're not human, you know.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.797
-I killed someone.
-Huh?

19:35.132 --> 19:37.551
<i>Reminded me of my mom.</i>

19:37.634 --> 19:40.679
<i>Woman had a son too. About my age.</i>

19:43.015 --> 19:44.558
<i>She was a bystander.</i>

19:44.641 --> 19:46.310
<i>A normal person.</i>

19:47.144 --> 19:48.770
<i>Who knows how many thugs I killed.</i>

19:49.354 --> 19:50.731
<i>How many goons.</i>

19:51.273 --> 19:54.151
<i>I lost count. Grew numb to it.</i>

19:55.736 --> 19:59.114
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I really am losing it.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.574
David, look.

20:01.450 --> 20:05.495
I ain't normal.
Said so yourself before. I'm different.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.831
-You're not.
-I am!

20:08.749 --> 20:10.500
You're not.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.086
-You just don't get it.
-Huh?

20:13.170 --> 20:17.382
You know, when Maine died,
didn't expect you to leave us too.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.092
I had to.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.677
I'm not mad.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.762
Why not?

20:21.845 --> 20:24.765
You deserve a way
out of this life.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.768
David, no. I… I'm not trying to--

20:27.851 --> 20:30.103
That mean you'll come back?

20:30.938 --> 20:34.358
You and me again. Turn back the clock.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.197
Can't quite do that yet.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.616
-Need just a little more time.
-What for?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.494
There's something I have to do.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.704
Can't tell me?

20:48.413 --> 20:49.623
Wish I could.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.542
-Just say it.
-Can't.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.419
'Cause you don't trust me?

20:55.671 --> 20:56.755
I'm sorry.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.842
Whatever. Forget it.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.347
Maybe we should…

21:05.430 --> 21:08.141
you know, go our separate ways.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.644
No, wait. That's not what I want.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.905
I'm sorry, David. But I just… I gotta go.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.408
Huh? Go where?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.411
I really need to.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.038
Sure.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.416
We'll talk when I get home.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.960
But please. Wait for me.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.810
<i>Net index. Same runner as before.</i>

21:53.020 --> 21:54.354
<i>There you are.</i>

22:18.795 --> 22:22.215
So simple. And here,
I expected fireworks.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.973
Looks like we just landed
our ticket into Arasaka.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.184
Magnificent job, Kiwi.
