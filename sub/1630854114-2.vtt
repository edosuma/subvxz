00:02.536 --> 00:03.771
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:03.871 --> 00:06.006
And one more
for your records.
What's this?

00:06.107 --> 00:09.077
My resignation.
Thank you for the last 30 years.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.112
(laughs)

00:11.212 --> 00:12.613
Wait, you're serious?
Yes,

00:12.713 --> 00:14.682
Mr. Wheeler, I wish you
continued success.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.950
Aw, just sit down,
let's talk about this.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.552
It is too late.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.289
I have already accepted
another job at Toesey Woesies.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.357
My sister stole you?

00:23.457 --> 00:25.759
If you call offering me
a higher paying job

00:25.859 --> 00:28.929
with better prospects
stealing, then yes.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.633
I'm just gonna say it.
It's weird without Goodwin here.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.902
We don't need anybody else.
We got Bob.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.238
He'll pick up the slack
like he always does.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.173
He's never let us down.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.342
When his father, Max, died,

00:41.442 --> 00:43.877
he quit school and
swooped in to save us.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.012
Isn't that right, honey?

00:45.113 --> 00:46.347
Gave up my dream

00:46.447 --> 00:47.948
of being a sportscaster
to come here.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.418
And when your first marriage was
falling apart, where were you?

00:51.219 --> 00:52.420
Here.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.522
And four days after
your heart attack,

00:54.622 --> 00:57.458
which this job gave you,
where were you?

00:57.558 --> 01:00.228
Right back here,
working up another one.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.295
DOTTIE: Exactly.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.763
My Bobby doesn't need friends.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.599
He doesn't need hobbies.
He's got MaxDot.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.836
The whole country could be hit
by an atomic bomb,

01:08.936 --> 01:11.572
and our little cockroach would
still be here selling socks.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.741
Hey, Bobby,
where you going?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.109
Bob?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.778
("Room Service" by Kiss playing)

01:17.878 --> 01:20.148
* I'm feeling low,
no place to go *

01:20.248 --> 01:22.916
* And I'm-a thinking
that I'm gonna scream... *

01:23.016 --> 01:24.752
MAN: Bob.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.287
Bob.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.821
Bobby.

01:28.722 --> 01:29.757
You mind turning that down?

01:29.857 --> 01:31.759
I can't hear myself drink.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.295
* To shut the light. *
(music turns off)

01:34.395 --> 01:36.830
Thank you.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.301
I know what you're gonna say,
Dad, you think I made a mistake.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.669
Yeah, maybe.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.437
Mistakes aren't always
a bad thing.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.872
Take your first marriage--

01:44.972 --> 01:47.408
that was a disaster,
but you're a better man for it.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.709
I am.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.279
I mean, that broad
was a nightmare.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.446
Yeah.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.481
I tried to tell you
at the wedding.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.517
I remember your speech.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.720
Well, that's blood
under the bridge.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.190
I see you lost some weight.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.325
Yeah, I'm trying to get healthy.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.495
(scoffs)
You kids and your crazy fads.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.332
I'm done, Dad.

02:11.432 --> 02:14.101
I can't do
the job anymore.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.069
Yeah, I get it.
You do?

02:16.170 --> 02:18.772
Yeah. You hit the wall.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.342
So, what do I do?
Simple.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.144
Pick yourself up,
brush yourself off,

02:24.245 --> 02:25.413
and get back to work.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.415
It's that easy, huh?

02:27.515 --> 02:31.252
Well, I was also a big fan
of the amphetamines.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.254
Used to get 'em
from a guy named Rick.

02:33.354 --> 02:37.024
You know, I think I got his
beeper number here somewhere.

02:39.227 --> 02:42.363
It's been 25 years.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.698
I'm fried. I'm tapped out.

02:44.798 --> 02:48.302
Aw, is it hard to run
the sock factory

02:48.402 --> 02:49.737
your daddy left you?

02:49.837 --> 02:52.373
As a matter of fact, it is.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.674
You know what my daddy left me?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.076
You told me:
a carton of cigarettes.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.044
Menthol.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.912
BOTH: Ugh.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.548
The job was
easy for you.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.116
You could sell bibles
to a brothel.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.520
I never sold them any bibles

03:06.620 --> 03:08.322
or compression socks.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.557
On the whole,

03:09.657 --> 03:11.992
prostitutes have
pretty good circulation.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.728
(sighs)

03:14.828 --> 03:16.230
I don't know how many years
I got left.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.433
I got to figure out
who I am, why I'm here.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.569
Don't tell me you're in therapy.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.438
No, as you can see,
I'm doing great.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.640
Here's all you need
to know, Bobby.

03:26.740 --> 03:30.010
Guys like you and me,
we're worker bees.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.281
You bring home the honey
till you die,

03:33.381 --> 03:35.182
or your stinger falls off.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.853
That's it?
Ah, it's not all bad.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.722
Worker bees
get to go on business trips,

03:41.822 --> 03:44.658
get to buzz around
some new flowers.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.261
Careful not to pollenate 'em.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.564
What if I don't want
to be a worker bee?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.333
What if I want to be
something else?

03:52.433 --> 03:55.536
What? The queen?
(chuckles)

03:55.636 --> 03:58.606
Oh, my God, is that why
you lost all the weight?

03:59.773 --> 04:01.875
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

04:28.201 --> 04:29.603
Did I tell you
my husband and I

04:29.703 --> 04:31.805
are sleeping in
separate bedrooms?

04:31.905 --> 04:33.441
Is everything all right?

04:33.541 --> 04:36.209
Everything's
fantastic.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.279
No more snoring,
fighting over blankets,

04:39.380 --> 04:41.281
and now, any time
I'm in the mood,

04:41.382 --> 04:44.284
he's my across-the-hall
booty call. (chuckles)

04:44.385 --> 04:47.655
Well, I'm happy where
my booty call is located.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.756
That's nice.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.991
It won't last,
but it's nice.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.127
(cell phone rings)

04:55.663 --> 04:56.630
Hello, Dottie.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.065
Hey, honey.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.368
I was just wondering
if you heard from Bob today.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.503
No.
DOTTIE: Oh.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.338
Okay.

05:04.438 --> 05:08.041
I'm sure everything's fine.
We'll talk later.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.042
Dottie, is something wrong?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.210
Well, I don't

05:10.310 --> 05:12.279
want to worry you, but...

05:12.380 --> 05:14.482
your husband has gone missing.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.883
What?
DOTTIE: Yeah.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.918
He walked out
in the middle of a meeting.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.687
Had this weird look on his face.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.988
What kind of weird look?

05:21.088 --> 05:24.458
Oh, you know, like
his will to live is gone.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.526
But I'm

05:25.626 --> 05:26.860
probably reading
too much into it.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.862
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.631
Hold on.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.669
(stammers)

05:35.769 --> 05:37.237
Straight to voice mail.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.039
He didn't pick up.
He always picks up.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.408
Now, take it easy,

05:40.508 --> 05:42.476
there could be
a lot of explanations.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.579
There's no reason to assume
he's dead in a ditch somewhere.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.747
Oh, my God.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.748
What's going on?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.182
Bob might be dead in a ditch.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.918
What?
DOTTIE: Just let me know

05:51.018 --> 05:52.820
if you hear from him.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.689
Or if he's brought
into your emergency room.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.891
I have to go and check
the emergency room.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.493
Well, anything I can do?

05:59.593 --> 06:02.229
Drive around, look at ditches.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.636
Hello, Douglas.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.170
Hey, man.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.105
Is that a beer?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.741
Yep. Want one?

06:13.841 --> 06:15.743
We are at work, Douglas.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.111
Yep. Want one?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.347
I know these are
uncertain times,

06:20.448 --> 06:21.682
but we do not have to give up

06:21.782 --> 06:23.484
just because Bob and Goodwin
have left.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.553
(scoffs) That's easy
for you to say.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.688
When this all goes down,
you'll get another job.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.691
My only skill is my
last name is Wheeler.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.226
That is not true,
you have skills.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.962
You don't have to humor me, man.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.198
I know I'm just
a pretty face and hair.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.101
I know you are scared,
we all are,

06:41.201 --> 06:42.335
but in times like this,

06:42.436 --> 06:44.137
we must be greater
than our fear.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.339
I tell you I don't
have any skills,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.141
and you think I can do that?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.377
You do not
have to do this alone.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.680
We are in this together.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.981
There you are.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.383
I found your résumé
in the copier.

06:56.484 --> 06:59.252
My résumé? You must be mistaken.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.054
Oh, really?
Is there another

07:01.154 --> 07:04.725
Kofoworola Olanipekun
working here?

07:04.825 --> 07:05.759
Dude.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.360
I was only putting out feelers.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.330
Well, how about
you feel this.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.901
I felt it.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.269
You can count on me, Mom.
I'm not going anywhere.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.839
Are you drunk?
Mm, almost.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.273
Give me that.

07:20.373 --> 07:23.977
And you can stick that résumé
where the sun don't shine.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.147
Like under a rock?

07:27.247 --> 07:29.983
More like a tiny cave.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.289
Bob, please call me
as soon as you get this.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.626
(sighs)
Voice mail again.

07:38.726 --> 07:42.329
I'm sure there's a
simple explanation.
Like what?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.397
He has fallen in love
with another woman

07:44.498 --> 07:46.800
and he's running
away from you.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.969
He would not do that.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.304
Okay.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.806
Would he do that?

07:52.906 --> 07:56.376
Maybe not, maybe
he is in a ditch.

07:58.812 --> 07:59.980
Hello, Mummy,

08:00.080 --> 08:02.650
if you hear from Bob,
please call me.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.786
Everything is fine,
we just cannot find him.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.456
No, he's not
running away from me.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.925
Okay, what
do we know?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.894
He suddenly left work,

08:13.994 --> 08:17.531
his phone is off,
he used to be fat.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.600
What does fat
have to do with anything?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.835
Fat men are grateful
for what they have.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.470
They do not run away
from their wives.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.873
They do not
run anywhere.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.808
You are being ridiculous.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.611
Hello, Auntie.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.981
If you hear from Bob,
please let me know.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.449
No, no, nothing is wrong,

08:36.550 --> 08:38.619
I just cannot find him.

08:39.653 --> 08:43.323
No, he is not
running away from me.

08:46.594 --> 08:49.630
Geez, look at this place.
Nothing's changed.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.932
Same menu.
Not true.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.701
They have a veggie dog now.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.704
What's that? Like,
a boiled carrot?

08:56.804 --> 08:59.172
Comes with barbecue sauce.
Mm.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.508
You and me ate here a lot.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.110
After every fight
with your mother.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.345
You and me ate here a lot.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.648
Your mother is a
passionate woman.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.350
I don't know how you guys
stayed together so long.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.086
Your mother is a
passionate woman.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.955
(groans) Oh.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.324
So, what's the
plan, son?

09:17.424 --> 09:19.259
I don't know.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.128
Thinking about
a vanilla shake.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.396
That's exactly
what I'd do.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.899
Eat yourself sick?
Fill the hole.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.469
You do it with food,
I did it with scotch.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.438
You also gambled.
Hey,

09:31.538 --> 09:35.042
if I wanted to talk to my wife,
I would've visited my wife.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.677
The point is,

09:36.777 --> 09:38.411
you do what you have
to do so you can

09:38.511 --> 09:39.947
get back to work
the next day.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.850
Says the guy who dropped dead
on the warehouse floor.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.785
A hero's death.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.554
Nope.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.457
What are you doing?

09:50.557 --> 09:52.860
I don't want to
end up like you.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.727
(scoffs)

09:53.827 --> 09:55.295
You just wasted a dollar.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.864
That hot dog was eight dollars.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.533
Eight dollars?!
That's a full tank of gas.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.436
Bob.
Thank God you're okay.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.405
I'm fine, I'm fine.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.040
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.509
I'm sorry, it's kind
of hard to explain.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.112
Oh, just tell her
you are running away.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.820
How'd you know
I'd be here?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.989
This is your happy place.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.157
And your sad place.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.060
And your "lost money
on a football game" place.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.862
Is that why you disappeared?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.331
Because you gambled away
Abishola's house?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.000
Can you give
us a minute?

10:33.100 --> 10:35.635
You can come live with me.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.740
I'm sorry I
didn't call.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.008
Are you running away from me?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.642
What? No, of
course not.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.778
You're the only thing
in my life I'm sure of.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.980
That is very sweet.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.349
Why didn't you call?

10:49.449 --> 10:50.951
Because I knew you'd
ask me what I'm doing,

10:51.051 --> 10:52.519
and I don't
have an answer.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.021
I have an answer.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.588
You have gone crazy.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.025
And that's why I didn't
want to talk to you.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.559
So, what am I supposed to do--
sit around

10:59.659 --> 11:02.062
and wait for my husband
to come to his senses?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.464
I just need
a little time.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.802
Take all the time you need.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.171
Let's go.
Mm-hmm.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.040
Make sure you keep the house.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.075
We will be happier there.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.944
SO that's the
new wife, eh?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.245
Yup.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.413
Not from Detroit,
I'm guessing.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.416
Nigeria.
No.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.584
Yeah.
How?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.220
I had a heart attack,
she was my nurse.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.622
And you bagged her?

11:29.723 --> 11:31.358
That's my boy.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.195
UNCLE TUNDE:
Oh,

11:35.295 --> 11:37.297
that is good news.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.900
Abishola found Bob, he's fine.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.234
Oh, thank God.
(all sigh)

11:41.334 --> 11:42.870
Why did he disappear
like that?

11:42.970 --> 11:46.173
Hold on. Uh, why did he
disappear like that?

11:46.273 --> 11:49.076
Apparently, he wanted a hot dog.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.443
Is he coming
back to work?

11:50.543 --> 11:53.513
Stand by.
Is he coming back to work?

11:53.613 --> 11:55.582
Ah-ha.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.450
I understand.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.886
No.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.587
Why?

12:00.687 --> 12:01.822
Why?

12:03.123 --> 12:04.557
Uh-huh.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.027
She does not know.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.829
What does she know?

12:08.929 --> 12:11.131
What do you know?

12:12.099 --> 12:13.600
I see.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.537
She says he did not
run away from her.

12:17.637 --> 12:21.374
That's not news. He's as loyal
as a three-legged dog.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.878
Dottie says that
he is as loyal as a dog

12:24.978 --> 12:27.080
with an amputate...

12:27.180 --> 12:28.581
She hung up.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.818
I can't believe
Bob quit on me.

12:30.918 --> 12:31.952
I'm so sorry.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.753
There is a
Nigerian saying,

12:33.854 --> 12:37.390
"Every time a child
chooses their own path,

12:37.490 --> 12:40.093
an angel falls from heaven."

12:40.193 --> 12:42.029
That is not a saying.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.663
I am trying to comfort her.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.366
Dele. Come here.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.302
A-Am I in trouble?

12:49.402 --> 12:52.172
The whole family
is in trouble.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.506
What's going on?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.742
Bob can no longer
provide for his family.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.278
You must be ready
to be the man of the house.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.715
I'm 15.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.985
I was 13

13:05.085 --> 13:07.054
when I started
my first business.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.555
It failed.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.423
I was 13.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.295
(sighs)
Oh, gosh. Okay, okay,

13:15.395 --> 13:17.430
you can do this,
you can do this.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.933
People get laid off
all the time.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.434
He will understand.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.304
Giving bad news doesn't make you
a bad person. (chuckles)

13:24.404 --> 13:27.274
You're just following orders.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.409
Like a Nazi.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.047
Hey, pal,
got a minute?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.382
Of course, please come in.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.084
Oh, I see
you've decorated

13:37.184 --> 13:38.685
your office already.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.154
Just a few pictures
of my family.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.556
A few... dozen.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.792
This is my
mother and father

13:45.893 --> 13:47.060
in Lagos.
Ah.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.229
My grandmother,
also in Lagos.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.165
Nice.
This is my grandfather,
he's dead.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.967
Buried in Lagos?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.668
Exactly right.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.205
So, uh...
And here is my cousin,

13:58.305 --> 14:00.974
Joseph, he lives in Liverpool,

14:01.074 --> 14:04.611
birthplace of the Beatles, but
he prefers the Rolling Stones.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.947
(giggles) Funny.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.181
It is. (laughs)

14:08.281 --> 14:10.817
So, listen...
And this is my sister,

14:10.918 --> 14:13.320
Blessing, lives
in Portland, Oregon,

14:13.420 --> 14:14.955
works for Nike.
Oh...

14:15.055 --> 14:16.223
See?

14:16.323 --> 14:18.358
For my birthday.
(laughs)

14:18.458 --> 14:20.293
Blessings from Blessing.
(chuckles)

14:20.393 --> 14:23.063
And this is my wife,

14:23.163 --> 14:26.499
my two daughters, and my son
when we were at Disney World.

14:26.599 --> 14:30.037
I-I see the mouse ears.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.704
(laughs) Cute story.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.173
Oh, great.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.607
My son, Bayo,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.944
ate so many sweet treats,
he had a stomach ache,

14:37.044 --> 14:40.914
and Goofy had to carry him
to first aid. (laughing)

14:41.014 --> 14:43.216
God bless Goofy.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.618
Speaking of nauseous...
I have told

14:45.718 --> 14:49.222
everyone how you gave me
this amazing opportunity.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.691
Awesome.
They cannot wait to meet you.

14:51.791 --> 14:52.960
Is that right?

14:53.060 --> 14:55.762
My children already call you
Auntie Christina.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.897
Oh, my God.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.933
Are you okay?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.935
No.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.704
I'm a Nazi.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.016
Last time I saw you
in the flesh,

15:16.116 --> 15:18.218
you were sitting
in that chair.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.553
Ah, the flesh.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.090
I don't miss it.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.093
If I remember correctly,
you were writing me a check.

15:26.193 --> 15:29.596
Sounds right. I loved
spending money on you kids.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.198
You were very generous.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.701
It was just my way of
compensating for all the guilt.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.569
What were you guilty about?

15:36.669 --> 15:40.207
Are you kidding? I worked 24/7.
I was never there for you.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.575
Hell, this is
the longest conversation

15:42.675 --> 15:46.013
you and me have ever had,
and I'm not really here.

15:46.113 --> 15:49.682
You took care of us.
You were a great dad.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.052
You know the secret
to being a great dad?

15:52.152 --> 15:55.088
What?
Die early.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.524
(knocking)
Come in.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.693
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Wheeler.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.296
Yeah, thanks for coming over.
Come on in, grab a chair.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.798
So...

16:05.898 --> 16:08.901
how you making out
over at Toesey Woesies?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.703
Oh, uh...

16:10.803 --> 16:12.239
it is wonderful.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.208
Going to work there was
the best decision of my life.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.476
That's great.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.346
Mm-hmm. Very great.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.281
And how are you doing?

16:21.381 --> 16:22.915
The truth?

16:23.016 --> 16:25.085
I've been talking
to my dead dad all day.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.321
Oh, I see.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.190
Uh, was he helpful?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.625
Actually, yeah.
It is important

16:32.725 --> 16:34.794
to talk to those
who have come before us,

16:34.894 --> 16:38.665
but do not ignore them,
they get angry.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.600
I'll keep that in mind.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.402
So, how may I help you?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.371
I had a job proposition for you,

16:44.471 --> 16:45.938
but you seem pretty happy
where you are.

16:46.039 --> 16:49.476
Very happy.
What is your proposition?

16:49.576 --> 16:51.211
How would you feel about sitting

16:51.311 --> 16:54.147
in that chair?

16:54.247 --> 16:55.615
That is your chair.
No.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.951
That chair belongs
to the president of the company.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.320
I'm gonna be CEO.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.422
What is the difference?

17:02.522 --> 17:03.756
Well, the president
does all the work

17:03.856 --> 17:06.193
and the CEO drops by
every now and then

17:06.293 --> 17:08.661
to criticize that work.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.098
So, you would be like my mother?

17:12.099 --> 17:13.500
Don't make it weird.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.138
So, what do you think?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.607
It would take a lot of money
for me to leave Toesey Woesies,

17:20.707 --> 17:23.743
which, as I mentioned, I love.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.312
I get it.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.515
Of course, your pay would be
appropriate to the position.

17:28.615 --> 17:31.251
And this would
definitely be my office?

17:31.351 --> 17:33.353
No take-backsies?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.422
This would be your office.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.457
Excuse me.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.958
Where you going?

17:39.058 --> 17:42.995
I have a box of pictures
in my car. I will be right back.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.865
Look at you,
delegating.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.701
It's the only way
I'm ever gonna have a life.

17:48.801 --> 17:52.004
What does that even
mean, "have a life"?

17:52.105 --> 17:54.641
Well, when you're on
your deathbed looking back,

17:54.741 --> 17:56.509
you have no regrets.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.412
Really?

17:59.512 --> 18:02.482
That's upsetting.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.418
I'll try and have a life
for both of us.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.020
I like that. Thanks.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.427
Call me if you need me.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.865
I'll always need you, Dad.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.500
Nah.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.935
You got this.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.874
I'm not asleep.
Of course you're not.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.478
Do you still need time to think?

19:05.578 --> 19:07.079
Nope. I got a plan.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.916
Good. I'm very
happy for you.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.153
You still mad at me?
Yes.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.688
But I'm glad you're home.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.790
Me too.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.026
Bob.
Yeah?

19:21.461 --> 19:24.030
The next time I'm
worried you are dead,

19:24.130 --> 19:25.632
you better be.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.004
I love you, too.
