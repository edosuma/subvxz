Previously on E. R.

00:05.013 --> 00:08.096
You're the chief of Emergency Medicine,
not the County's lesbian advocate!

00:08.096 --> 00:10.146
That's where you're wrong, Robert.
Because I'm both.

00:10.147 --> 00:13.710
I'm the Chief of Emergency Medicine
and I'm a lesbian.

00:15.287 --> 00:18.129
Jesse. Come on.

00:18.241 --> 00:20.127
It's his nephew.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.009
Some guy opened fire
in a foster-care facility.

00:24.010 --> 00:25.400
Fossen? Derek Fossen?

00:25.601 --> 00:27.685
Fourteen shots. Six deaths.

00:27.786 --> 00:29.946
That maniac shot her at her house.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.743
You took his kid away from him, right?

00:32.195 --> 00:34.748
There were police in the house
and the front door's been kicked in.

Subtítles TusSeries

01:00.513 --> 01:05.108
Psych? My daughter
doesn't need a psychiatrist.

01:06.411 --> 01:09.749
I just need to talk to her. That's all.

01:10.169 --> 01:12.329
- Can you get him on the phone?
- When did he die?

01:12.507 --> 01:14.087
It's Dr. Carter in the ER.

01:14.261 --> 01:16.303
- How long does a CAT scan take?
- I'll hold.

01:16.474 --> 01:18.848
I'm off at 4 if you want
to go get coffee.

01:19.605 --> 01:23.024
- Two hundred people back at the house.
- There's coffee there, isn't there?

01:23.195 --> 01:25.355
I wouldn't ask you
to subject yourself to that.

01:26.202 --> 01:27.484
- Dr. Weisman?
- Yes?

01:27.664 --> 01:32.295
You have a patient, Holly Evans, who
was supposed to be admitted last night.

01:32.465 --> 01:35.588
Say he doesn't die on the table
or in post-op.

01:35.764 --> 01:38.221
You ship him back
to his convenience-store alley.

01:38.394 --> 01:40.471
But this time,
instead of getting beaten up...

01:40.647 --> 01:43.735
...he gets eaten by dogs
because he's too weak to move.

01:43.905 --> 01:45.186
- Eaten by dogs?
- It happens.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.990
- In Chicago?
- A lot. A cop told me.

01:48.163 --> 01:50.573
Dr. Romano needs you
in his office immediately.

01:50.752 --> 01:53.292
- Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.

01:53.465 --> 01:54.665
He says it's important.

01:54.843 --> 01:57.087
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

01:57.934 --> 02:00.308
- Hey, Mark, you got a second?
- No.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.939
Look, is Cleo having trouble
with the triple cocktail?

02:03.110 --> 02:04.356
- What?
- She was nauseated.

02:04.530 --> 02:08.828
She's alone and afraid. And has now
been waiting for almost 20 hours.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.408
No.

02:10.584 --> 02:13.754
No, pull your thumb out,
get down here and admit your patient.

02:14.133 --> 02:17.754
Give her another gram of cefoxitin
and order a clear-liquid diet.

02:17.932 --> 02:20.259
- "Pull your thumb out"?
- Call me in half an hour...

02:20.436 --> 02:22.812
...if someone from Pedes
doesn't get down here.

02:22.984 --> 02:26.273
Exactly what don't you want me
to subject myself to?

02:26.742 --> 02:29.615
- Dr. Weaver.
- Abby, John.

02:30.249 --> 02:34.001
- Things are a little tense. See you later.
- I can imagine.

02:34.173 --> 02:36.216
Queen Elizabeth wants me
to meet her boy.

02:36.386 --> 02:38.547
- Got room for a Haldol deficiency?
- Over there.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.933
Because we are compatible.

02:41.104 --> 02:44.558
- Who, you and Prince Charles?
- He likes coffee and so do I.

02:44.736 --> 02:47.741
- I could be princess.
- He is mine, honey.

02:47.909 --> 02:51.448
- Abby? MVA with PSl rolling up.
- Coming.

02:51.626 --> 02:54.201
- Hey, you stay away from him.
- I promise.

02:54.381 --> 02:56.422
There's an apartment listed
in that building.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.255
- Which?
- The one you like on Clark.

02:58.556 --> 03:01.132
Two bedrooms, big closets, wood floors.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.353
- You went there?
- Yeah. I called the manager.

03:03.525 --> 03:05.734
She already had two people interested.

03:05.905 --> 03:09.193
- Are you seriously considering it?
- I thought you liked that area.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.698
Oh, I can't afford that kind of rent.

03:13.336 --> 03:16.175
- Don't worry about it.
- And I'm pretty happy where I am.

03:17.386 --> 03:18.263
- Oh, I-
- You know-

04:28.507 --> 04:30.997
- How much is this?
- For you, $20.

04:31.175 --> 04:32.835
- Is it real?
- Of course.

04:33.010 --> 04:34.636
No. I mean authentic.

04:35.345 --> 04:38.429
Direct from Kenya, pretty lady.
Imported with my own two hands.

04:38.598 --> 04:40.473
All right. I'll take it.

04:42.227 --> 04:43.850
Don't bother. It's not a gift.

04:44.102 --> 04:46.224
At some point,
we have to have some standards.

04:46.396 --> 04:47.677
Who decides, you?

04:47.856 --> 04:50.014
They decided when they chose
to participate.

04:50.191 --> 04:52.812
You judge someone based
on what they do in their bedroom?

04:52.985 --> 04:55.985
Look, I have no problem
with alternative lifestyles.

04:56.154 --> 04:58.063
But we 're talking about
role models here.

04:58.239 --> 04:59.733
So you would oppose gay teachers?

04:59.907 --> 05:04.034
I oppose any homosexual in a job
where they interact and influence-

05:04.203 --> 05:05.993
Okay.

05:10.708 --> 05:13.874
Exactly what don't you want me
to subject myself to?

05:14.503 --> 05:16.708
- Dr. Weaver.
- Abby, John.

05:16.879 --> 05:20.747
- Hey, chief. Back in the saddle so soon?
- Yeah. We weren't expecting you.

05:20.925 --> 05:22.632
- It's been three weeks.
- Already?

05:22.801 --> 05:26.384
Man, the time really flies when you're,
you know, missing a colleague.

05:26.555 --> 05:28.381
Malik, you got that x-ray going?

05:28.556 --> 05:30.679
- What x-ray?
- The one with the kid.

05:30.849 --> 05:32.427
Yeah.

05:32.601 --> 05:35.269
Abby, MVA with a PSl rolling up.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.769
- I love your hair color. It's perfect.
- Oh, thank you.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.061
- It's strong. It's very-
- Thank you.

05:42.651 --> 05:45.604
- Awesome bracelet. Where'd you get it?
- A place in Nairobi.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.770
- Was it totally amazing?
- What?

05:47.947 --> 05:51.943
- Africa.
- It was exactly as I remembered it.

06:12.217 --> 06:14.423
She's not breathing.

06:14.593 --> 06:16.633
Pulse is thready, bradying down to 50.

06:16.803 --> 06:18.880
P.E.A. Starting compressions.

06:19.055 --> 06:21.297
Two of O-neg on the infuser.
Get some saline.

06:21.474 --> 06:23.550
- How'd she get upstairs?
- She's an ER patient?

06:23.726 --> 06:26.477
Came in with facial fracture,
abdominal pain, broken wrist.

06:26.645 --> 06:29.052
Waiting for Psych.
Pregnant with her brother's baby.

06:29.230 --> 06:32.266
- Why wasn't anyone monitoring?
- Short-handed with Legaspi gone.

06:33.066 --> 06:34.939
Another 2 cc's in the cuff.

06:35.110 --> 06:36.769
Hey, give me a vascular clamp.

06:36.944 --> 06:38.569
They haven't replaced Legaspi?

06:38.737 --> 06:41.988
- Someone said she got a job in California.
- We should be so lucky.

06:42.157 --> 06:43.901
Is that true?

06:44.617 --> 06:47.701
Dr. Weaver, have you heard
from Dr. Legaspi?

06:50.789 --> 06:52.117
Probably a tension pneumo.

06:52.290 --> 06:55.492
- What happened?
- Four-story fall. GCS of 3. Now in P.E.A.

06:55.667 --> 06:56.997
- How did she fall?
- She jumped.

06:57.169 --> 06:58.628
Pulse ox, 74 on 100 percent.

06:58.796 --> 07:00.254
- Did she ever have a pulse?
- No.

07:00.422 --> 07:03.338
- Try for a central line.
- No. Open up another tray.

07:03.508 --> 07:05.381
We've got this, Kerry.
Go get cleaned up.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.219
- Prep for a subclavian.
- I want a second chest tube first.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.589
-10 blade. Let's move.
- Really, Kerry, we've got it.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.507
- Set up a Thora-Seal.
- Holding compressions.

07:14.683 --> 07:17.352
- Pretty agonal. You want atropine?
- Yeah. Push a milligram.

07:17.519 --> 07:19.178
Let's set up a pericardiocentesis.

07:19.354 --> 07:21.181
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.636
How long are we going?

07:27.861 --> 07:30.351
Dr. Weaver, how was your trip?

07:30.529 --> 07:31.905
Hot. It was hot.

07:32.074 --> 07:34.029
Hey, I never got a chance
to thank you.

07:34.742 --> 07:36.983
- For what?
- I got my Chief Resident confirmation.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.318
- I won't let you down.
- I'm sure you won't.

07:39.704 --> 07:43.286
No! No!

07:43.457 --> 07:45.201
No, no, no!

07:45.376 --> 07:48.661
- You should sue that Scottish bastard.
- What?

07:48.837 --> 07:52.121
Sleazebag host will say anything
to get you on his show.

07:52.297 --> 07:55.381
Mr. Peterson started a brawl
at a talk-show taping.

07:55.550 --> 07:57.838
Somebody smacked me
with a microphone.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.208
Carl?

07:59.388 --> 08:01.712
Stay the hell away from me, you queer.

08:01.889 --> 08:04.925
- Carl, let me drive you home.
- I don't dig penises, okay?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.507
- I have only one more operation.
- Touch me, I swear-

08:07.685 --> 08:09.227
Hey. You need to calm down.

08:09.394 --> 08:13.095
Calm down? This thing makes me
look like some twisted fairy.

08:13.273 --> 08:15.312
- You knew. Part of you knew.
- Security.

08:15.943 --> 08:17.649
You see this, huh?

08:17.817 --> 08:21.186
Man, woman. That's what I know.
That's normal.

08:21.363 --> 08:23.735
It's still love, Carl. Love is love.

08:23.906 --> 08:27.073
It's perverted, you faggot!
It's sick. You disgust me.

08:27.243 --> 08:29.780
- Calm down, sir.
- You're a freak!

08:29.954 --> 08:32.527
- Please calm down.
- Damn homo.

08:33.498 --> 08:35.206
You all right?

08:35.374 --> 08:37.450
Take it easy, all right?

08:37.626 --> 08:40.116
- You going to the M&M?
- What?

08:40.294 --> 08:43.249
On Fossen. The M&M's starting.

08:51.304 --> 08:54.388
Luka, has there been any talk...

08:54.557 --> 08:55.755
...about me?

08:55.933 --> 08:57.972
Kerry, people always talk
about their bosses.

08:58.142 --> 08:59.637
No, I-

08:59.812 --> 09:02.598
- I mean personally.
- Personally?

09:02.771 --> 09:04.431
Well, Dr. Weaver.

09:04.606 --> 09:07.560
I thought maybe you fell under the spell
of some Masai warrior...

09:07.734 --> 09:10.770
...and were never coming back.
Coming in?

09:10.945 --> 09:13.614
Why wasn't lidocaine given
for a stable V-tach?

09:14.197 --> 09:16.688
I didn't have
the ACLS drug box with me.

09:17.242 --> 09:19.235
When transferring a critical patient?

09:19.743 --> 09:22.363
The Trauma nurse ran out to get it...

09:22.955 --> 09:25.113
...but then the doors
closed unexpectedly.

09:25.290 --> 09:28.456
- Leaving you alone with the patient?
- Right.

09:28.875 --> 09:31.081
Dr. Legaspi, however, is a lesbian.
Am I right?

09:31.545 --> 09:34.748
- Yes.
- Isn't that a little barbaric?

09:35.298 --> 09:38.666
I've never hidden that fact from
this administration or my colleagues.

09:38.842 --> 09:40.716
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

09:40.886 --> 09:44.835
How many openly gay women do you
know in hospital administrative positions?

09:45.014 --> 09:46.638
None. It doesn't happen.

09:46.807 --> 09:49.427
Then deal with the stigma
of being gay.

09:50.602 --> 09:52.061
You care to comment on that?

09:57.608 --> 09:59.315
Dr. Weaver.

09:59.484 --> 10:02.057
In your opinion,
was the patient's care compromised?

10:02.362 --> 10:03.440
Compromised?

10:03.696 --> 10:06.862
Did the ER accept too many
Trauma patients that day?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.696
I don't believe so.

10:09.868 --> 10:11.694
We were busy, but we handled it.

10:14.954 --> 10:16.497
Watch your back.

10:16.665 --> 10:19.500
Kerry, you under the weather?

10:19.668 --> 10:22.453
- Excuse me?
- You were a little slow on the uptake.

10:22.627 --> 10:24.171
Jet lag.

10:24.338 --> 10:26.663
Oh, yes. Your trip to Africa, was it?

10:26.840 --> 10:28.879
Spontaneous decision.
Doesn't seem like you.

10:29.050 --> 10:31.505
Half of my accrued personal days
were about to expire.

10:31.677 --> 10:35.460
It still doesn't justify you going MIA
for three weeks with no real warning.

10:35.638 --> 10:39.505
You know what? I took a vacation. I may
take another. I still have 19 days banked.

10:39.683 --> 10:41.094
I see.

10:41.268 --> 10:43.842
You might want to try Papua
New Guinea next time.

10:44.021 --> 10:46.891
I hear they put gourds
on their penises.

10:47.982 --> 10:50.140
Give some notice next time.

10:50.735 --> 10:52.810
- Wait. Robert.
- Careful, Kerry.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.729
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm good.

10:54.905 --> 10:58.770
You know, you could just call my office.
You don't have to beat up the elevator.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.739
You...

11:01.117 --> 11:03.739
- Who have you told?
- Told who what?

11:03.911 --> 11:07.529
About what we discussed before I left.

11:07.707 --> 11:10.623
Oh, yes. Legaspi.
As ordered, I backed off.

11:10.792 --> 11:13.995
But she was determined to leave,
decided she didn't like us anymore...

11:14.169 --> 11:18.381
...and was gonna move and work in
San Francisco, I understand. Go figure.

11:18.716 --> 11:22.498
Have you told anyone about me?

11:22.677 --> 11:26.509
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.

11:31.267 --> 11:34.220
Have you told anyone
that I'm a lesbian?

11:37.314 --> 11:38.855
No, Kerry.

11:39.023 --> 11:41.940
I assumed that that was confidential.

11:42.109 --> 11:43.734
Was I wrong to assume that?

11:43.903 --> 11:46.903
I mean, if you want to tell everyone,
that's your business.

11:47.071 --> 11:49.563
But I don't see how
a person's sexual affairs...

11:49.740 --> 11:54.070
...are appropriate subject matter for a
workplace conversation, do you, Kerry?

11:56.914 --> 11:58.372
No.

11:58.539 --> 12:00.202
Glad we're on the same page.

12:08.222 --> 12:11.722
- We got aluminum rotors in stock?
- Doubt it. Want me to order some?

12:12.611 --> 12:14.892
- If it's not too much trouble.
- Pads too?

12:15.228 --> 12:17.019
I'm sure your father
will give me a deal.

12:17.521 --> 12:20.144
If I ever need an operation,
you better not charge me.

12:20.316 --> 12:22.225
Just for parts.

12:22.401 --> 12:25.236
- What's this, summer session?
- Chem 2.

12:26.447 --> 12:28.855
Look, if you can pay him,
you should pay him.

12:29.075 --> 12:31.316
- Mom got fired.
- What happened?

12:31.493 --> 12:34.197
You can only take a leave of absence
for just so long.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.747
Hey, you know what?
You should bring Cleo over.

12:39.918 --> 12:43.499
- We haven't seen you guys in a while.
- We're taking a little break right now.

12:43.671 --> 12:45.165
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

12:45.339 --> 12:47.130
She's going through
some rough stuff...

12:47.299 --> 12:50.086
...and she needed a little room.
I'm respecting that.

12:50.761 --> 12:52.504
- Did you reach him?
- No, not yet.

12:52.679 --> 12:54.338
I'm gonna try him again in a few.

12:54.514 --> 12:56.507
Look at that.
You'd think she had fangs.

12:56.683 --> 12:59.767
- He said he'd come to check on me.
- I know.

13:01.479 --> 13:04.433
Nine years I've been hosting a talk show.
I've never gotten bit.

13:04.774 --> 13:07.809
- I thought those fights were all staged.
- Not exactly.

13:07.984 --> 13:09.692
But people don't usually get hurt.

13:10.778 --> 13:13.613
We use lightweight furniture,
just in case.

13:13.781 --> 13:17.944
Guys tend to get unglued when their
lover tells them she used to be a man.

13:18.118 --> 13:20.788
- Can you get AIDS from a she-male bite?
- What?

13:20.955 --> 13:22.746
I think one of the transsexuals bit me.

13:22.915 --> 13:24.872
Excuse me.

13:25.292 --> 13:26.917
She broke the skin.

13:27.085 --> 13:29.458
- Cleo? Hey, you all right?
- Y eah.

13:29.630 --> 13:31.503
- I heard you got sick.
- A little nauseous.

13:31.673 --> 13:33.298
- Trouble with your meds?
- I'm fine.

13:33.466 --> 13:35.624
You're still taking them, though, right?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.752
- Do you want to help out?
- Sure.

13:38.928 --> 13:41.384
A 20-year-old girl fell down
and broke her left wrist.

13:41.557 --> 13:42.801
Doesn't sound surgical.

13:42.974 --> 13:46.142
Then smacked repeatedly with a
folding chair to the face and abdomen.

13:46.311 --> 13:48.304
- Talk-show brawl?
- She's a little worked up.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.480
Just found out her boyfriend
is also her half-brother.

13:52.650 --> 13:55.223
Right. Up.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.229
Down.

13:57.570 --> 14:02.114
Okay. You might have a facial fracture.
I need to see some x-rays.

14:03.660 --> 14:06.446
Is this tender? How about here?

14:06.621 --> 14:10.949
I need to use ultrasound on your belly
to rule out internal bleeding, okay?

14:13.378 --> 14:14.705
- Alice.
- Get out!

14:14.877 --> 14:16.254
- Get out!
- Let me explain-

14:16.421 --> 14:18.248
- You tell me on TV.
- I know.

14:18.423 --> 14:21.425
You keep this from me.
You let me date him.

14:21.593 --> 14:24.676
And you knew we were having sex,
and you tell me on TV!

14:24.845 --> 14:26.969
- The producers made me do that.
- Get out!

14:27.140 --> 14:30.389
- You need to sit and let us monitor you.
- I need to talk to Alice.

14:30.559 --> 14:31.971
Alice, honey, I love you.

14:32.145 --> 14:34.351
- I can explain this whole thing.
- Get out!

14:34.521 --> 14:36.514
- I can explain this.
- Get out!

14:36.690 --> 14:38.019
- Please.
- Alice?

14:44.489 --> 14:47.240
Can you tell if I'm pregnant with that?

14:47.533 --> 14:48.814
Do you think you are?

14:53.580 --> 14:55.323
I might be.

15:00.711 --> 15:02.336
It looks like about 10 weeks.

15:04.966 --> 15:06.589
I was gonna keep it.

15:10.137 --> 15:12.758
This can't be happening.

15:13.556 --> 15:16.925
This can't be true. I love him so much.

15:18.228 --> 15:20.600
It's not fair.

15:21.731 --> 15:25.893
There's no intra-abdominal bleeding, but
I'm gonna get a CT scan of your face.

15:32.450 --> 15:33.942
Could you close the curtain?

15:34.868 --> 15:36.409
Sure.

15:38.454 --> 15:42.747
- Dr. Benton, can I discharge Molton?
- As soon as he's done with his IV.

15:43.084 --> 15:47.128
Also, this girl needs a facial CT
and a Psych consult.

15:47.295 --> 15:48.541
- Weaver's here!
- What?

15:48.714 --> 15:50.540
Why didn't someone say
she was working?

15:50.715 --> 15:52.589
- She's on the schedule.
- Take this down.

15:52.758 --> 15:55.594
I know I know you from somewhere.

15:55.762 --> 15:57.635
- I wouldn't forget that smile.
- All right.

15:57.805 --> 16:01.588
Put Neosporin on it three times a day
and don't wash your hair for two days.

16:01.768 --> 16:03.593
No way. I'm a bridesmaid
on Saturday.

16:03.768 --> 16:05.926
I have to wash my hair.
I wanna look good.

16:06.104 --> 16:08.228
Dr. Romano needs you
in his office immediately.

16:08.398 --> 16:10.770
- Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.

16:10.942 --> 16:12.139
He says it's important.

16:12.319 --> 16:15.272
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

16:15.446 --> 16:17.438
- Hey, Mark, you got a minute?
- No.

16:17.614 --> 16:20.104
Is Cleo having trouble
with the triple cocktail?

16:20.284 --> 16:21.612
- What?
- She was nauseated.

16:21.785 --> 16:24.406
- Has she had a repeat antibody test?
- You should ask her.

16:24.579 --> 16:26.820
I want to make sure
they're following her LFTs.

16:26.998 --> 16:29.157
Peter, you should talk to her.

16:31.461 --> 16:33.951
- Uncle Peter.
- Joanie?

16:34.130 --> 16:35.789
- What's wrong?
- Can I talk to you?

16:35.964 --> 16:37.673
Your parathyroidectomy's ready to go.

16:37.842 --> 16:40.249
Put his film on a view box.
I'll be right back.

16:40.427 --> 16:42.420
- What's up?
- I think they're gonna break up.

16:42.596 --> 16:44.138
- Who?
- My mom and my dad.

16:44.305 --> 16:48.303
I didn't notice until I came home for the
summer, but it's really bad, Uncle Peter.

16:48.476 --> 16:50.433
I mean, one minute, Mom seems okay.

16:50.603 --> 16:53.141
The next, she's crying
and locks herself in the bedroom.

16:53.314 --> 16:56.813
Dad won't even say anything. He just
gets all quiet and stares into space.

16:56.984 --> 17:00.068
- Look, they lost their son. It's normal.
- No, it is not normal.

17:00.237 --> 17:03.687
They fight all the time about her job,
about Jesse's room.

17:03.864 --> 17:07.565
Dad washed a shirt that had
his scent on it, and Mom went nuts.

17:07.993 --> 17:11.611
And then Dad stayed out all night.
I don't know. It's just messed up.

17:11.788 --> 17:13.117
Somebody's gotta talk to her.

17:13.290 --> 17:17.453
There's nothing I can say, and there's
nothing you can do but give it time.

17:17.627 --> 17:22.040
- It's almost been a year, Uncle Peter.
- Joanie, I know, but it-

17:24.134 --> 17:25.710
- Trauma 1?
- Yeah. It's your patient.

17:25.885 --> 17:28.173
- My patient?
- Yeah, the girl from the talk show.

17:28.345 --> 17:29.841
What?

17:30.264 --> 17:31.508
Probably a tension pneumo.

17:31.681 --> 17:35.928
- What happened?
- Four-story fall. GCS of three. In P.E.A.

17:36.103 --> 17:37.430
- How'd she fall?
- She jumped.

17:37.603 --> 17:39.062
Pulse ox, 74 on 100 percent.

17:39.230 --> 17:40.690
- Did she ever have a pulse?
- No.

17:40.858 --> 17:43.561
- Try for a central line.
- Let's open up another tray first.

17:43.735 --> 17:45.358
We've got this. Go get cleaned up.

17:45.527 --> 17:48.314
- Prep for a subclavian.
- Not until I get a second chest tube.

17:48.488 --> 17:50.944
Really, Kerry. We've got it.

17:51.116 --> 17:54.319
- Set up a Thora-Seal.
- Holding compressions.

17:54.494 --> 17:57.697
- Pretty agonal. You want atropine?
- Yeah. Push a milligram.

17:57.872 --> 17:59.496
Let's set up a pericardiocentesis.

17:59.666 --> 18:02.238
- What did you say to her?
- I didn't say anything to her.

18:04.878 --> 18:08.544
I'm in. Check the tamponade.
Give her 8 units packed cells.

18:10.967 --> 18:14.382
- I feel a pulse.
- Injury occurring on the monitor.

18:15.806 --> 18:18.094
Blood in the pericardium.

18:18.266 --> 18:19.972
220 cc's out.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.885
- Rate is 29.
- Still no pulse.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.635
All right. Resuming compressions.
Another amp of epi.

18:24.814 --> 18:26.438
- Mother's outside.
- Keep her out.

18:26.774 --> 18:28.932
- I'll tell her.
- I'm not ready to call it yet.

18:29.526 --> 18:30.901
You will be.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.943
Let it circulate.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.784
Dr. Benton?

18:39.952 --> 18:42.240
Asystole.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.038
No!

18:48.209 --> 18:49.409
No!

18:49.587 --> 18:54.248
No, no, no! No, no!

18:58.719 --> 19:01.257
Time of death, 12:17.

19:15.567 --> 19:17.145
- Peter.
- Hey.

19:17.319 --> 19:19.478
- Hi.
- What, are you spring-cleaning?

19:19.655 --> 19:21.777
- Getting rid of some crap.
- It's not too dark?

19:21.948 --> 19:24.237
I wanted to finish.
Salvation Army comes tomorrow.

19:24.409 --> 19:27.114
- All right. Well, let me give you a hand.
- I'm almost done.

19:27.287 --> 19:29.114
Want a hamster cage?

19:29.289 --> 19:31.696
- No?
- You okay?

19:31.874 --> 19:33.416
What did you need, Peter?

19:33.584 --> 19:38.127
I- What? I just came by
for a snow shovel.

19:38.922 --> 19:41.625
All right. I came to check on you.

19:42.133 --> 19:44.210
I heard you lost your job.

19:47.429 --> 19:50.466
We'll just have to wait
to expand that porch.

19:50.807 --> 19:52.966
What's wrong with the porch?

19:53.476 --> 19:55.268
I don't know.

19:55.812 --> 19:58.137
I thought it was time for a change.

20:00.400 --> 20:05.311
Walt took some pictures of the back
yard that we could xerox and draw on...

20:05.488 --> 20:07.314
...make plans.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.653
When I went to pick up the prints...

20:13.245 --> 20:15.914
...I found three pictures of Jesse
left on the roll.

20:20.042 --> 20:22.083
I fell apart.

20:22.253 --> 20:24.162
Right in the store.

20:24.672 --> 20:26.795
I realized...

20:27.466 --> 20:29.173
...that's it.

20:31.010 --> 20:33.715
There'll never be any more
pictures of him.

20:37.266 --> 20:38.845
Fifteen years old.

20:40.102 --> 20:42.594
And he's never gonna change.

20:48.610 --> 20:53.022
You think every day you're getting
a little better, getting through it.

20:54.449 --> 20:57.366
And then you're right back
to the day it happened.

21:01.997 --> 21:05.616
He's still my baby, Peter.

21:07.753 --> 21:10.458
I'm supposed to take care of him.

21:15.593 --> 21:17.715
I feel like...

21:18.471 --> 21:21.969
...somewhere, sometime...

21:22.140 --> 21:24.466
...he's gonna be sad...

21:24.893 --> 21:26.767
...or cold...

21:27.396 --> 21:29.518
...or scared.

21:32.483 --> 21:34.891
Who's taking care of him?

21:36.653 --> 21:38.940
Who's being his mother?

22:35.431 --> 22:40.222
"I am the resurrection and the life,"
sayeth the Lord.

22:40.769 --> 22:46.558
"He that believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

22:47.276 --> 22:51.060
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die.

22:51.573 --> 22:54.242
We brought nothing into this world.

22:54.618 --> 22:58.449
And it is certain
we'd carry nothing out.

22:58.621 --> 23:02.868
Wherefore my heart is glad
and my spirit rejoiceth...

23:03.041 --> 23:06.209
...my flesh also shall rest in hope. "

23:06.379 --> 23:10.958
The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.

23:11.134 --> 23:13.672
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

23:13.845 --> 23:18.138
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

23:18.307 --> 23:19.967
...through our Lord, Jesus Christ...

23:20.142 --> 23:25.350
...we commend to almighty God
our brother John.

23:25.982 --> 23:28.852
And we commit his body
to the ground.

23:29.026 --> 23:30.485
Earth to earth...

23:30.653 --> 23:32.481
...ashes to ashes...

23:32.655 --> 23:34.981
...dust to dust.

23:38.994 --> 23:41.485
Dad did a nice job with the eulogy.

23:41.664 --> 23:44.038
He worked on it for a while.

23:45.419 --> 23:48.337
- Grandpa would have liked it.
- Yes.

23:52.926 --> 23:54.884
Gamma seems to be holding up.

23:55.053 --> 23:57.461
I expect she would.

24:05.315 --> 24:07.852
Is that for your convenience
or someone else's?

24:09.860 --> 24:11.403
- Hello.
- Bad time?

24:11.570 --> 24:13.729
Yeah. Kind of busy. Why?

24:14.406 --> 24:16.364
Wait, wait. She's not on the ward?

24:18.536 --> 24:20.612
Weisman was supposed
to admit her last night.

24:20.788 --> 24:23.539
- She's sitting right here.
- What's her hemoglobin?

24:26.711 --> 24:28.917
Okay, yeah. No, I'll be right there.

24:29.089 --> 24:30.665
Fifteen minutes.

24:32.050 --> 24:35.384
We need to make a stop
at County General Hospital.

24:35.553 --> 24:38.389
- Just get off on Division.
- Yes, sir.

24:40.099 --> 24:42.935
This shouldn't take long.

24:44.228 --> 24:45.853
You mind?

24:47.065 --> 24:49.604
- Can someone shut him up?
- Why don't you both shut up.

24:49.776 --> 24:52.610
I got a right to be here, same as you.

24:52.778 --> 24:54.238
Hi.

24:55.407 --> 24:57.944
- You left without saying goodbye.
- You were asleep.

24:58.117 --> 25:01.653
- For about 10 minutes.
- I'm sorry. I had someplace to be.

25:02.081 --> 25:04.239
- I don't like it here.
- I know.

25:04.457 --> 25:08.870
But we'll make sure that you get your
own bed and your own room upstairs.

25:09.045 --> 25:12.747
- You said that last night.
- Well, they're still working on it.

25:13.092 --> 25:15.249
- But I'm gonna go hurry them up, okay?
- Okay.

25:15.427 --> 25:16.970
Any more pain in your stomach?

25:17.136 --> 25:19.177
- A little.
- We'll take care of that.

25:19.348 --> 25:22.634
And Abby here is gonna hang out
with you until they bring you up.

25:23.268 --> 25:25.759
Tell her to call me again
if you want to talk to me.

25:26.271 --> 25:29.273
- Thanks for coming back.
- You're welcome.

25:32.611 --> 25:34.604
What was her last crit?

25:34.947 --> 25:37.106
Thirty-six, after two doses
of Solu-Medrol.

25:37.283 --> 25:40.450
Give her four more, MS, then Q2 p. r. n.

25:40.620 --> 25:42.742
- When are her parents getting here?
- Around 3.

25:42.913 --> 25:46.164
- They missed their connecting flight.
- Dr. Weisman, please.

25:46.334 --> 25:48.125
Nice suit. Who died?

25:48.294 --> 25:50.252
My grandfather.

25:51.966 --> 25:54.254
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

25:54.801 --> 25:57.089
No, no. Can you get him
on the phone now?

25:57.261 --> 26:00.466
- When did he die?
- It's Dr. Carter in the ER.

26:00.974 --> 26:03.429
- Monday.
- Wow.

26:03.601 --> 26:05.310
You okay?

26:06.771 --> 26:09.688
I'm off at 4 if you want
to go get a coffee or something.

26:09.858 --> 26:12.528
I got 200 people back at the house.

26:12.695 --> 26:14.319
There's coffee there, isn't there?

26:15.280 --> 26:18.115
I wouldn't ask you
to subject yourself to that.

26:19.785 --> 26:21.493
Dr. Weisman? This is Dr. Carter.

26:21.662 --> 26:25.162
You have a patient, Holly Evans, who
was supposed to be admitted last night.

26:39.847 --> 26:41.507
Wait.

26:44.893 --> 26:47.183
- Thank you.
- Did the driver get lost?

26:47.354 --> 26:49.264
John had something more pressing.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.349
It was trouble with a patient.

26:51.734 --> 26:54.022
- Decent turnout.
- It'll do.

26:54.194 --> 26:56.816
- Where's Gamma?
- Lying down. Said she was tired.

26:57.448 --> 26:59.357
- Where are you staying?
- The Drake.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.236
The Ritz-Carlton was booked.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.943
Did you think about staying here?

27:05.373 --> 27:08.539
Oh, there's Peter Harkins.
I should say hello.

27:11.128 --> 27:13.965
- Who's Peter Harkins?
- He's handling the probate.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.544
I'm gonna check on Gamma.

27:15.718 --> 27:16.915
- I did. She's fine.
- Still-

27:17.093 --> 27:19.549
You want to help your grandmother,
be a good host.

27:19.722 --> 27:23.634
Introduce yourself to Senator Herrero's
daughter. Arthur.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.118
Dr. Carter, your friend is here.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.204
- Holly got her bed.
- Yeah? Did Weisman come down?

27:53.381 --> 27:56.583
Yeah. A few minutes after you called.

27:56.759 --> 28:00.378
Amazing what a little
"pull your thumb out" will do.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.677
- Did you eat something?
- No.

28:04.058 --> 28:08.270
I couldn't decide between the smoked
tongue pâté and the whitefish mousse.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.596
We must have run out
of the pigs-in-the-blanket.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.181
Well, somebody should really
talk to your caterer.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.441
You're gonna have some dirty birds.

28:17.613 --> 28:20.448
Grandpa liked to drive
the power lawn mower around.

28:21.450 --> 28:24.285
- And he drove it into the birdbath?
- Not on purpose.

28:24.454 --> 28:27.408
He was having a fatal Ml at the time.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.584
Oh, God!

28:32.754 --> 28:34.710
I'm sorry.

28:35.257 --> 28:37.047
You gotta die somehow.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.126
It's not a bad way to go.

28:39.303 --> 28:41.296
A sunny day...

28:41.764 --> 28:43.637
...out on the mower.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.926
- Don't laugh.
- I'm sorry.

28:49.521 --> 28:52.013
- Don't laugh.
- Well, stop it.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.317
Oh, God.

28:59.823 --> 29:03.573
I hope it's all right that I came here.
I'm not usually a funeral crasher.

29:03.744 --> 29:05.783
Figured this would be a good one?

29:05.954 --> 29:08.161
And I felt bad...

29:09.167 --> 29:13.663
...that your grandfather died
and we didn't even talk about it.

29:15.506 --> 29:18.175
John, have you seen Millicent?

29:18.842 --> 29:20.301
No.

29:21.596 --> 29:24.513
Mom, this is my friend Abby.
Abby, this is my mother, Eleanor.

29:24.682 --> 29:26.638
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:27.603 --> 29:30.935
Things are winding down.
She really needs to make an appearance.

29:31.105 --> 29:34.687
- I will go and look for her in a minute.
- Please do.

29:39.364 --> 29:41.107
Sorry.

29:41.782 --> 29:45.068
- It's okay.
- It's my parents. They don't...

29:45.745 --> 29:48.200
They don't handle loss well.

29:49.207 --> 29:50.915
Who does?

29:51.542 --> 29:54.793
It's been a while since we've had
to deal with this sort of thing.

29:55.422 --> 29:57.415
Since your brother died?

30:09.061 --> 30:10.720
You'd better go.

30:21.073 --> 30:23.195
54. That was back in July.

30:23.491 --> 30:24.523
Oh, come on.

30:24.702 --> 30:26.410
fall from grace for the NASDAQ.

30:27.288 --> 30:29.079
- John?
- Hey.

30:29.248 --> 30:33.293
- Is everything okay?
- Y eah. Just took a hit on Parning.

30:33.460 --> 30:36.628
Biotech's in the basement again.

30:37.005 --> 30:38.584
- You want a drink?
- No, thank you.

30:38.758 --> 30:40.751
Have you seen Gamma?

30:40.927 --> 30:42.966
Haven't given up that quest, huh?

30:43.137 --> 30:45.509
Oh, Mom thinks
she might be hiding out.

30:45.681 --> 30:49.264
I don't blame her.
That room can get insufferable.

30:49.728 --> 30:51.685
Dad, I think you should
stay here tonight.

30:52.188 --> 30:53.765
Don't worry. We have a driver.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.441
No. I meant for Gamma.

30:56.608 --> 31:00.524
- You know how your mom feels about it.
- Well, then stand up to her this time.

31:00.697 --> 31:04.825
Thanks for the counsel.
I'll take it under advisement.

31:06.119 --> 31:07.911
She buried her husband today.

31:08.079 --> 31:10.203
Yes, I know. My father.

31:10.374 --> 31:13.078
- Then don't run away again.
- Drop it, John.

31:16.380 --> 31:18.087
Leave it alone.

31:21.634 --> 31:23.627
I've left it...

31:23.803 --> 31:25.512
...alone.

31:30.352 --> 31:32.475
Bobby's not coming back.

31:33.773 --> 31:37.604
If Mom wants to walk around in
a bubble for the rest of her life, fine.

31:37.777 --> 31:40.812
But don't let her keep holding you
inside of it.

31:56.671 --> 31:58.747
You might want to try the garage.

32:05.096 --> 32:06.757
Damn it.

32:07.806 --> 32:12.967
- Gamma?
- I can't get this stupid thing started.

32:14.314 --> 32:16.436
Well, it sounds like it's flooded.

32:16.607 --> 32:18.599
You need to let it sit.

32:22.030 --> 32:25.363
- Your mother sent you.
- Yeah.

32:25.701 --> 32:28.737
- People want to pay their respects.
- Well, they can wait.

32:28.912 --> 32:30.157
I'm the widow.

32:34.043 --> 32:37.127
I hope you weren't thinking
about drinking and driving.

32:40.048 --> 32:43.547
We were saving that bottle
for our 60th anniversary.

32:43.719 --> 32:46.043
Missed it by a year.

32:46.389 --> 32:48.048
Open it.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.135
No, you can still wait.

32:50.811 --> 32:53.929
Let's drink to your grandfather.

32:59.234 --> 33:00.563
It's a very nice vintage.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.942
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather share this with-?

33:07.368 --> 33:08.779
We don't have any glasses.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.575
You can drink from the bottle.

33:18.129 --> 33:20.703
To John Truman Carter...

33:21.382 --> 33:23.422
...entrepreneur...

33:23.926 --> 33:26.002
...philanthropist...

33:27.263 --> 33:28.924
...family man.

33:29.099 --> 33:30.427
And friend.

33:48.409 --> 33:51.411
We gonna take this old girl
out for a spin, or what?

33:51.788 --> 33:53.495
Damn right.

34:28.253 --> 34:30.330
Okay, that's it.

34:30.505 --> 34:33.591
- How'd it look?
- Have to wait for the radiologist.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.219
You saw it.

34:35.387 --> 34:37.545
- I'm just a tech.
- Did you see anything bad?

34:37.722 --> 34:39.716
- You want to take on Fossen, Mark?
- What?

34:39.893 --> 34:41.601
The shooter.
He coded in the elevator.

34:41.770 --> 34:44.262
I thought maybe you should
present him in M&M.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.184
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.351
- Did you give nitro?
- Two sprays, no relief.

34:48.529 --> 34:51.614
Can you see if they brought my
daughter? I think she broke her arm.

34:51.783 --> 34:54.110
- Is this from the talk show?
- How'd you guess?

34:54.286 --> 34:57.121
- They're stacked up in the waiting room.
- How'd it start?

34:57.290 --> 35:00.292
How do any of them start?
I heard somebody bit the host this time.

35:00.462 --> 35:05.124
- So I only present the cab driver.
- Luka, relax, okay?

35:05.301 --> 35:08.007
Just stick to the facts. You'll be fine.

35:08.181 --> 35:10.968
Cleo, check a 12-lead and a-

35:13.019 --> 35:14.977
The meds?

35:15.397 --> 35:16.774
Third time today.

35:16.942 --> 35:18.139
- You tried Compazine?
- Yeah.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.355
- We can get you some Zofran.
- I can live with the nausea.

35:21.531 --> 35:25.317
- My liver enzymes were up last week.
- Meds might be giving you hepatitis.

35:25.495 --> 35:26.739
Only one more week.

35:26.913 --> 35:28.871
- Three out of four might be enough.
- Maybe.

35:29.041 --> 35:31.579
- You don't want to hurt your liver.
- I want to be safe.

35:31.752 --> 35:34.754
- Malucci, need something to do?
- No. I'm swamped, actually.

35:34.923 --> 35:36.632
- Want my opinion?
- I guess so.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.210
Reduce your dose
and monitor your LFTs.

35:39.389 --> 35:40.716
- Talk show?
- No. Casey Square.

35:40.889 --> 35:43.178
A bunch of teenagers beat him up
for his coin cup.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.550
Trauma 2.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.971
Contusions to the face,
chest, everything.

35:47.148 --> 35:49.937
- Didn't anybody see this happening?
- The whole plaza saw it.

35:50.111 --> 35:53.527
All right. Get a surgical consult
and x-ray. I'll be right there.

35:53.697 --> 35:55.904
- Nobody did anything?
- Just his homeless buddies.

35:56.075 --> 35:58.237
- Hi, Adele.
- Hi.

35:58.414 --> 36:01.533
- How's physical therapy?
- It's hard.

36:01.708 --> 36:05.043
- Have you got up on crutches?
- Yeah, with leg braces, yeah.

36:05.213 --> 36:07.586
- That's a good sign.
- Well, I'm trying.

36:08.134 --> 36:10.625
But I'm also realistic.

36:10.804 --> 36:14.885
Romano wanted me to go to Morbidity
and Mortality as a show-and-tell.

36:17.647 --> 36:20.517
- Are you presenting Fossen?
- Y eah.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.779
Well, have fun.

36:23.946 --> 36:25.572
- I need an ultrasound.
- Coming.

36:25.742 --> 36:27.200
C- spine's ready.

36:27.367 --> 36:30.488
- Did you get his pressure up?
-90/60 after a liter.

36:30.664 --> 36:33.784
Hi, it's Abby calling about
your colitis patient, Holly.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.713
She keeps asking for you.
Could you call me? Thanks.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.920
Everything hurts.

36:39.091 --> 36:41.251
Okay, we can take the collar off now.

36:41.428 --> 36:43.587
- How'd it go?
- What?

36:43.764 --> 36:46.801
Oh, right. Good.
Yeah. Still have a brain.

36:46.977 --> 36:48.721
- Mark.
- Everything's normal.

36:49.188 --> 36:52.725
I still can't believe people would stand
there and watch someone get beaten.

36:52.902 --> 36:56.650
- How are you holding up?
- Six weeks maternity leave, not enough.

36:56.823 --> 36:58.947
We have fluid in Morrison's pouch.
Call O.R.

36:59.534 --> 37:01.328
- Where?
- There.

37:01.496 --> 37:05.709
- It appears you're bleeding internally-
- It could be ascites from cirrhosis.

37:05.876 --> 37:07.121
I can't assume that.

37:07.294 --> 37:09.869
- What's his blood alcohol?
-315.

37:10.048 --> 37:12.042
When was your last drink,
Mr. Skapinski?

37:12.218 --> 37:14.426
They took my last drink.

37:15.430 --> 37:19.180
- He's hypotensive with a low crit.
- He could be septic from pneumonia.

37:19.478 --> 37:22.017
- High risk for surgery.
- Even riskier if he bleeds out.

37:22.191 --> 37:25.809
Let's take a deep breath
and do a peritoneal lavage.

37:25.986 --> 37:29.190
- He's a surgical candidate.
- A homeless alcoholic with pneumonia.

37:29.366 --> 37:30.612
Therefore not worth saving?

37:30.785 --> 37:33.656
He's as healthy as he'll get.
I'm trying to keep him that way.

37:33.830 --> 37:36.500
- Surgery could kill him.
- Delaying surgery could kill him.

37:36.668 --> 37:38.791
Say he doesn't die on the table
or in post-op.

37:38.962 --> 37:41.252
You ship him back
to his convenience-store alley.

37:41.424 --> 37:43.631
But this time,
instead of getting beaten up...

37:43.801 --> 37:46.756
...he gets eaten by dogs
because he's too weak to move.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.259
- Eaten by dogs?
- It happens.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.510
- In Chicago?
- A lot. A cop told me.

37:50.686 --> 37:53.522
Dr. Romano needs to speak
to you in his office immediately.

37:53.689 --> 37:56.147
- Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.

37:56.318 --> 37:57.516
He says it's important.

37:57.695 --> 38:00.531
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

38:00.907 --> 38:04.360
M&Ms. They serve their purpose
in the practice of medicine, I guess.

38:04.537 --> 38:07.455
- But they can be a pain in the ass.
- Needed something, Robert?

38:07.624 --> 38:10.247
I hear you're presenting
this serial killer.

38:10.420 --> 38:13.042
- Mass murderer?
- Right, right. This Fossen guy.

38:13.716 --> 38:15.756
- You don't want me to?
- No. It's just that...

38:15.927 --> 38:20.306
...Legal flagged something. I wanted
you to be prepared for the question.

38:20.892 --> 38:22.221
Sure. Go ahead.

38:22.394 --> 38:24.387
It's no big deal.
It's their job to be anal.

38:24.813 --> 38:26.059
Yeah. What is it?

38:26.399 --> 38:31.193
Well, the nurse's notes show that
you left the Trauma Room at 1625.

38:31.823 --> 38:35.027
And the code-blue notes
from pre-op began at 1642.

38:35.202 --> 38:38.952
Why'd it take you 17 minutes
to transfer a patient up four floors?

38:39.626 --> 38:41.417
Well... I-

38:41.585 --> 38:44.078
Dr. Romano, there's an incident
in the ambulance bay.

38:44.257 --> 38:45.536
I'm in a meeting, Brenda.

38:45.716 --> 38:48.090
An ER patient jumped out
a fourth-floor window.

38:49.888 --> 38:53.803
That's great news, Brenda, thank you.
Are they dead?

38:53.977 --> 38:55.721
I don't know. They're working on her.

38:55.896 --> 38:58.733
Keep the press away. No statements
from anyone to anyone...

38:58.901 --> 39:02.734
...and get Risk Management down there.
Why I wanted this job I will never know.

39:02.906 --> 39:06.858
All right, Greene, let's go. As you
can see, I've got bigger fish to fry.

39:08.038 --> 39:10.031
Doors opened on the surgical floor.

39:10.207 --> 39:15.832
I was alone doing chest compressions,
ran down the defib battery.

39:16.006 --> 39:18.628
Took time to get help...

39:18.968 --> 39:20.962
...transfer the patient to pre-op.

39:23.266 --> 39:26.138
Okey-doke. Brenda, get PR on the line.

39:26.313 --> 39:28.638
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

39:28.815 --> 39:31.733
I don't think anyone's gonna be crying
over this guy. Do you?

39:32.403 --> 39:38.277
Autopsy revealed injuries to the spleen
and superior mesenteric artery.

39:38.495 --> 39:42.826
Cause of death: exsanguination
from multiple vascular injuries.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.788
Why wasn't lidocaine given
for stable V-tach?

39:46.337 --> 39:48.877
I didn't have the ACLS
drug box with me.

39:49.342 --> 39:51.465
When transferring a critical patient?

39:51.929 --> 39:56.639
The Trauma nurse ran out to get it,
but then the doors closed unexpectedly.

39:57.269 --> 40:00.188
- Leaving you alone with the patient?
- Yes.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.898
I don't know if it would have
changed the outcome.

40:04.070 --> 40:07.854
I'm sorry. Did you say the original
dysrhythmia was stable V-tach?

40:08.408 --> 40:09.690
Yes.

40:10.453 --> 40:12.281
He had a pulse?

40:12.456 --> 40:13.867
That's correct.

40:14.709 --> 40:17.996
- So the patient was conscious?
- Yes.

40:19.381 --> 40:21.173
I didn't realize that.

40:22.052 --> 40:24.044
Were you involved with this case,
Dr. Corday?

40:24.597 --> 40:26.555
No. No.

40:27.100 --> 40:31.645
Wait a minute. You cardioverted
a patient without sedation?

40:32.273 --> 40:35.394
- Yes.
- Isn't that a little barbaric?

40:36.362 --> 40:39.069
Under the circumstances,
it's what I felt I needed to do.

40:39.242 --> 40:42.362
Was there any delay
in the O.R. accepting the patient?

40:43.580 --> 40:45.205
Dr. Greene?

40:46.250 --> 40:47.745
No.

40:49.295 --> 40:50.542
Did you know him?

40:50.714 --> 40:52.708
- Who?
- His grandfather.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.756
Yeah. I met him at that charity event.

40:55.931 --> 40:57.305
Charity event?

40:57.473 --> 41:00.226
Abby, where's my patient?

41:00.394 --> 41:02.186
Dr. Corday took him up to surgery.

41:02.355 --> 41:04.681
- I thought you okayed it.
- Yeah.

41:05.150 --> 41:08.270
- So you're going?
- Yeah.

41:08.446 --> 41:11.282
- Mrs. Jenkins.
- Could you take this tube out?

41:11.450 --> 41:13.858
They wouldn't take this tube out.

41:14.412 --> 41:18.281
This is a coroner's case.
I'm sorry, we have to wait.

41:20.461 --> 41:24.840
They flew us to Chicago
and put us up in the Hilton...

41:25.218 --> 41:29.798
...gave me money to go shopping with.
They even took me to a dentist.

41:30.725 --> 41:34.641
The producers said not to tell her
until after the taping.

41:34.815 --> 41:40.486
That it would be more real if she
didn't know what I was gonna say.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.576
It was a lie.

41:48.250 --> 41:49.494
It was all a lie.

41:50.335 --> 41:53.372
All that stuff about them
having the same daddies...

41:53.547 --> 41:57.333
...I just said that to get them
on the show.

41:59.180 --> 42:05.055
I used to say, "Alice,
you must always tell the truth. "

42:05.772 --> 42:08.856
And she'd go, "Well, why, Mommy? "

42:09.193 --> 42:10.853
And I'd say:

42:11.028 --> 42:14.363
"Because when you don't...

42:14.533 --> 42:17.203
...God gets very angry. "

42:34.142 --> 42:35.885
How is she?

42:36.437 --> 42:40.056
Catherine said she slept
for three hours this afternoon.

42:40.233 --> 42:43.190
- Has she fed?
- Just now.

42:46.158 --> 42:47.783
How's our patient?

42:47.952 --> 42:51.074
Extubated in Recovery when I left.

42:51.249 --> 42:53.491
I repaired a little omental oozing.

42:53.668 --> 42:57.084
But it might have stopped on its own.
It's hard to say.

42:58.091 --> 43:00.000
Judgment call.

43:01.094 --> 43:03.466
You do what you think is right, Mark.

43:06.268 --> 43:09.472
Elizabeth, in the elevator with Fossen-

43:09.647 --> 43:13.018
I think we've talked enough
about Fossen today, don't you?

43:27.504 --> 43:29.498
I'm going to bed.

43:29.882 --> 43:31.626
You coming?

43:32.635 --> 43:36.385
Just wait a few minutes.
Make sure she's down.

43:37.518 --> 43:39.345
Okay.

43:41.481 --> 43:44.352
- Good night.
- Night.

43:46.487 --> 43:49.026
Night-night, sweetheart.

44:00.840 --> 44:02.466
Mark...

44:06.054 --> 44:07.336
...I'll get up with her.

44:09.518 --> 44:11.175
Okay.
