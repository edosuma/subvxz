to know you in a way

19:19.421 --> 19:20.883
no one else does.

19:20.983 --> 19:23.125
-So we know you're funny.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

19:23.225 --> 19:25.707
Now we want to know what it felt
like the day your dad left.

I am getting the onion, now.

19:31.113 --> 19:32.895

No, I got the gum. Look at this.

19:42.244 --> 19:43.786

-I got the gum.

19:43.886 --> 19:45.788
-You did that?
-Yeah. You saw that?

-That's what I'm talking about.

-Finley. I like him.

-Hey.

Sorry.

misplace a Post-It

with my allergist's number
on it.

20:16.359 --> 20:17.941
It says "Dr. Sneeze."
That's not his name.

You know, when I learned

20:43.467 --> 20:45.489
that a Black man created
the filament system,

20:45.589 --> 20:48.132
I knew I had to create something

Yeah. Well, that's why I want to
help you reach a wider audience.

I don't, I don't need
the sales pitch, okay?

21:08.413 --> 21:09.955

21:53.900 --> 21:55.481

Your installation

21:55.581 --> 22:00.246

at the exact same time

22:00.346 --> 22:03.289
that Kerry James Marshall's
Curtain Girl came out.

22:03.389 --> 22:07.654
Now, I've always thought
that your work was related.

22:07.754 --> 22:11.698
Am I right, or is that just
a coincidence, or... what?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.860

22:13.960 --> 22:16.303

and I do, I do believe

22:19.646 --> 22:20.867
that we are connected.

22:20.967 --> 22:22.869
Uh, whether it be
through our legacy,

22:22.969 --> 22:25.472

22:29.096 --> 22:31.759

to-to show Kerry,

22:31.859 --> 22:33.881

22:33.981 --> 22:37.084
I just felt, at the time,
you know, he wasn't ready.

Kerry James Marshall,

wasn't on the Zakarian roster

who that is

in which he signs with Isaac.

he'll exclusively work with you?

that leave me?

[Micah]
Okay, so your dad

40:30.727 --> 40:32.348
mainly asked
for, like, paperwork.

40:32.448 --> 40:34.310
Um, so I found
your car registration,

40:34.410 --> 40:36.112
your passport, stuff like that.

40:36.212 --> 40:37.754
Great.

40:37.854 --> 40:40.437
Yeah. Uh, and then I took
the liberty of finding more,

40:40.537 --> 40:43.600
uh, practical things, like,
uh, clothes and, uh, a book

40:43.700 --> 40:46.623
I think you were reading,
um, and a phone charger.

40:48.865 --> 40:50.607
I would say thank you,
but I'm pretty sure

40:50.707 --> 40:53.330
you owe me at least that.

40:53.430 --> 40:55.132
Yeah.

40:55.232 --> 40:57.394
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you're right.

40:58.996 --> 41:00.297
This looks good.

41:00.397 --> 41:02.780
Sophie brought it.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.282
It's probably poison.

41:08.005 --> 41:10.187
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

41:10.287 --> 41:11.829
Bet you are.

41:11.929 --> 41:13.971
I just, I didn't want
to ruin your relationship.

41:17.895 --> 41:19.637
Too late for that.

41:19.737 --> 41:21.779
You know, I just--
I thought that...

41:22.980 --> 41:25.003
Well, it doesn't matter
what I thought.

41:25.103 --> 41:26.804
No, you know, it kind of does.

41:26.904 --> 41:29.287
-I thought you were happy.
-I was!

41:29.387 --> 41:31.649
I thought--

41:31.749 --> 41:34.612
She made me happy, and I thought
we were gonna be happy forever.

41:34.712 --> 41:36.995
That was kind of the whole idea.

41:38.156 --> 41:40.138
You still could be.

41:40.238 --> 41:41.540
How?

41:41.640 --> 41:44.342
I-I can't just undo
what she did.

41:44.442 --> 41:46.505
What they did.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.627
No.

41:48.727 --> 41:51.930
But you could forgive her.

41:54.373 --> 41:56.875
Look, uh...

41:56.975 --> 41:59.037
I know it doesn't feel like it,

but... you have all
the power right now.

42:02.221 --> 42:04.203
Trust me.

42:04.303 --> 42:07.366
If you don't want to be
with her, that's one thing,

42:07.466 --> 42:09.168
but...

42:09.268 --> 42:11.931
if you want to forgive her,
you could.

42:12.031 --> 42:14.633
No one would judge you.

we had is kind of backfiring.

something's going on with you,

to figure out what it is.

nothing's wrong

-Yes.
-Okay.

No.

No.
