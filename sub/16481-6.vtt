ZAYDAY: <i> It's Chamberlain.</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:06.271
<i>I have my suspicions that he's</i>

00:06.273 --> 00:08.106
<i>the baby in the belly</i>
<i>from 1985.</i>

00:08.109 --> 00:09.308
I'm gonna get

CHANEL #5:
<i>I just don't understand</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:13.112
<i>why we even need</i>
<i>any more Chanels.</i>

00:13.114 --> 00:14.346
We need cannon fodder.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.381
We need new Chanels

00:15.383 --> 00:16.949
<i>for the Green Meanie to attack</i>

00:16.951 --> 00:18.117
<i>so he doesn't murder us!</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:19.451
(all screaming)

00:27.061 --> 00:29.428
This is a normal pint of blood.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.331
This is a pint of blood

00:32.333 --> 00:34.066
I just tried to give a patient

00:34.068 --> 00:35.901
with hemolytic anemia.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.070
As you can see,
has a little mouse in it.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.304
And this one...

00:39.306 --> 00:42.074
has a bunch of coins
at the bottom.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.243
Clearly, the only blood
at this hospital

00:44.245 --> 00:45.978
is blood spilled
by the Green Meanie

00:45.980 --> 00:49.982
that has been mopped up
and put back into bags.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.917
Sorry. That's on me.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.018
I've just gotten
really into

00:53.020 --> 00:54.086
recycling lately
and instead of just

00:54.088 --> 00:55.254
dumping all these
patients' blood

00:55.256 --> 00:57.056
into the swamp
like everything else,

00:57.058 --> 00:58.257
I thought it'd be nice
if that patient's

00:58.259 --> 01:01.060
blood could have
a second life...

01:01.062 --> 01:02.327
pumping through
the hearts and boners

01:02.329 --> 01:04.263
of all the neediest patients
at this hospital.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.099
The problem is clear.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.367
This hospital

01:08.369 --> 01:10.903
is in desperate need of blood.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.938
So, we're gonna have
to get donations.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.273
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God! A blood drive,

01:14.275 --> 01:16.175
blood drive, blood drive,
blood drive, blood drive!

01:16.177 --> 01:18.210
What?
We should have a blood drive.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.079
Okay, it'll be amazing.
We'll get the fresh pints

01:20.081 --> 01:22.915
we need and I'll get to flex
my phlebotomy muscles.

01:22.917 --> 01:26.218
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, but...

01:26.220 --> 01:29.188
that is an excellent idea,
Chanel.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.956
Oh.
MUNSCH:
Really.

01:30.958 --> 01:34.026
It'll be wonderful PR
for the hospital.

01:34.028 --> 01:37.229
And we can spin the murders
in a very positive way.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.064
Exactly.

01:39.066 --> 01:44.002
"We've lost a lot of blood,
so donate yours."

Excuse me,

03:28.375 --> 03:30.075

CHANEL #5: Wait!

03:32.046 --> 03:34.046
Are you announcing
Employee of the Month?

03:34.048 --> 03:36.381
Because, uh, I think that having

03:36.383 --> 03:38.383
half of my body

who isn't here
for the announcement

03:50.264 --> 03:52.164
should not be eligible

Shut up!

03:53.167 --> 03:55.234
All of you, shut up.

There is no
employee of the month!

03:59.173 --> 04:01.173
I am here to announce
that Dean Munsch

04:01.175 --> 04:03.008
has approved my plan

04:03.010 --> 04:06.044
to create some incentive
for the blood drive.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.213
It is now a contest.

04:08.215 --> 04:12.251
The employee that collects
the most blood

04:12.253 --> 04:16.053

<i>is a remote, jungle island</i>

04:25.232 --> 04:26.965
<i>in the South China Sea</i>

04:26.967 --> 04:28.934
<i>that the Chinese</i>

04:40.314 --> 04:41.313

04:43.317 --> 04:46.051
There is no way
I'm not winning this thing.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.086
That's what I'm counting on,
Chanel.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.955
Maybe you can bring
your two friends.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.123
Screw that!

04:51.125 --> 04:53.125
I am taking sexy Dr. Brock

04:53.127 --> 04:57.062
and he and I are gonna work on
my daddy issues all week long.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.334
Just a little prick.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.935
The only little
one in here,

05:03.937 --> 05:05.937
I can guarantee you that.

05:05.939 --> 05:06.938
Can you please

05:06.940 --> 05:07.939
stop flirting with Dr. Brock

05:07.941 --> 05:09.174
as if he had sex with you

05:09.176 --> 05:11.009
for any reason other than
the fact that he was

05:11.011 --> 05:12.110
sad about me

05:12.112 --> 05:13.178
and you were the closest

05:13.180 --> 05:14.246
semi-damp orifice.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.081
Thank you
for letting me

05:16.083 --> 05:17.983
be the one to draw your blood,
Brocky.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.351
You know every drop counts
towards the competition

05:19.353 --> 05:22.254
and I really want to win
so we can go on our romantic,

05:22.256 --> 05:25.157
all-expenses-paid vacation
to Blood Island.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.992
Now, have you done any research
on this place?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.094
Because it doesn't
sound very romantic.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.329
Oh, I'm sure you'll be fine.

05:30.331 --> 05:33.098
I mean, clearly,
you're a risk taker, Brock.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.100
And millennials
like Chanel here,

05:35.102 --> 05:37.102
they live in
a post-AIDS world.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.938
Most of them just assume
they're gonna get HPV,

05:39.940 --> 05:41.106
herpes or the clap.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.175
Excuse me,
but I am perfectly clean.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.977
Honestly, Brock,

05:45.979 --> 05:47.346
I think you're safer
putting your penis

05:47.348 --> 05:49.381
in a land mine
or a wood chipper,

05:49.383 --> 05:52.017
than having sex with Chanel.
(breathes heavily)

05:52.019 --> 05:53.318
Well, that-that maybe true,

05:53.320 --> 05:55.120
but at least he doesn't
have to worry about me

05:55.122 --> 05:56.321
doing old person
stuff during sex.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.323
Yeah, like, uh,
driving way too slow,

05:58.325 --> 06:00.959
or peeing when I sneeze
or getting Alzheimer's,

06:00.961 --> 06:03.095
like some people I know.

06:05.232 --> 06:08.133
Okay, look at you.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.068
You filled that bag up fast.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.136
Let's get another
one going.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.238
Wait, what?!
I have to give more?

06:13.240 --> 06:16.007
No, I'm... I am
very woozy right now.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.309
I think I need,
like, um, a cookie.

06:17.311 --> 06:19.010
You don't need a cookie.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.245
You're type "O" negative,
Number Five.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.080
That is the universal donor.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.415
It's the most valuable blood
there is.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.151
Blood type and Rhesus factor

06:26.153 --> 06:27.986
are inherited from our parents,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.154
which means your mom and dad

06:29.156 --> 06:30.322
would have to be "O" negative,
as well.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.257
We actually should get them
to donate.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.027
Wait a second.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.396
That's it!

06:37.398 --> 06:39.231
Orange juice! Cookies!

06:39.233 --> 06:41.166
Yes, please,
I would love...

06:41.168 --> 06:42.234
We screen

06:42.236 --> 06:44.336
all the staff's blood.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.037
Uh...
(blows air)

06:46.039 --> 06:47.205
I do not know what
you're talking about.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.273
Look, we know that the killer

06:48.275 --> 06:50.008
is someone at the hospital

06:50.010 --> 06:52.277
who is the baby in the belly
in 1985, right?

06:52.279 --> 06:54.079
And we know that
you inherit

06:54.081 --> 06:55.947
your blood type
from your parents.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.182
That means if we somehow

06:57.184 --> 06:59.184
got a blood type
from Jane Hollis

06:59.186 --> 07:02.187
and cross-referenced it with the
blood samples we got from staff,

07:02.189 --> 07:04.055
we could figure out
if there's a link.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.025
Um, yeah, so,
I'm... definitely not

07:07.027 --> 07:09.027
in a state where I can follow
anything that you're saying.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.929
I mean, it's not perfect.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.230
We're not necessarily gonna
find out who the killer is,

07:12.232 --> 07:15.100
but we could find out
who the killer is not.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.402
Like, if Jane's blood type
was AB,

07:17.404 --> 07:21.239
she'd pass the A
or the B or both to her child.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.375
(laughs)

07:23.377 --> 07:24.376
Eh, uh...

07:24.378 --> 07:25.377
Thanks, Number Five.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.179
I'm gonna get to work.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.247
Wait, what?

07:29.249 --> 07:30.916
No, you can't
just walk away.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.351
I'm too weak to move.

07:41.261 --> 07:44.129
Are you okay?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.130
(grunts)

07:45.132 --> 07:47.165
Yeah.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.067
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...

07:49.069 --> 07:51.136
when I get stressed out...

07:51.138 --> 07:53.939
my hand starts acting up,
trying to take control.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.340
That's why I play games
like this to show him

07:55.342 --> 07:56.408
that I'm in charge,

07:56.410 --> 07:58.410
not him.

07:58.412 --> 08:02.080
If it was up to him, he'd be
stabbing me all the time.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.148
Stab everyone, really.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.183
(grunts)

08:06.153 --> 08:09.087
(chuckles)

08:09.089 --> 08:11.923
Well, you know what's weird?

08:11.925 --> 08:14.326
These are the hands

08:16.363 --> 08:19.331
But when I'm around you,

08:19.333 --> 08:22.200

I want to get our
first time out of the way

08:33.179 --> 08:34.212
before we go to Blood Island.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.947
That way I won't feel pressure

08:35.948 --> 08:37.182
to skip out
on any spa treatments

08:37.183 --> 08:40.352
or avoid getting blind
drunk at the pool bar.

08:40.354 --> 08:44.155
Yeah, uh...
one... quick...

08:44.157 --> 08:46.091
What's wrong?

08:47.227 --> 08:49.227
I know, at first,
touching me feels like

08:49.229 --> 08:51.229
you know, you're making out
with a 13-year-old boy,

08:51.231 --> 08:52.998

I get my clothes off,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.232
I am super feminine.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.035
No, your body's great,
it's just...

08:57.037 --> 08:59.404
I have a few concerns.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.043
That's a list of STD tests
I'd like you to get

09:05.045 --> 09:07.012
before we exchange
any bodily fluids.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.079
What? This is like...

09:08.081 --> 09:09.180
this is, like, nine pages long.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.016
Yeah, there's 217.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.250
It's every sexually
transmitted disease

09:12.252 --> 09:13.351
known to
modern medicine...

09:13.353 --> 09:14.386
thus far.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.254
I promise
I wouldn't make you

09:16.256 --> 09:18.356
go through all this
if I didn't really like you.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.325
I mean... this is a compliment.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.227
I mean, if I didn't
have feelings for you,

09:22.229 --> 09:23.361
I'd just strap on
three condoms

09:23.363 --> 09:25.030
and wish
for the best, but...

09:25.032 --> 09:27.899
with you, I'd like to try two.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.234
And eventually...

09:29.236 --> 09:31.336
maybe in time, just one.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.372
Oh! Really?

09:34.374 --> 09:36.274
Mm-hmm.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.076
Okay, I am gonna take the test,

09:38.078 --> 09:40.178
and when they all come back
negative, I am gonna win

09:40.180 --> 09:42.914
the blood drive competition, and
we can go on a romantic getaway

09:42.916 --> 09:44.115

Apparently, they got another
anonymous tip you're the killer.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.131

Hey, Hoffel,
you know,

I feel awful that
I didn't welcome you properly

10:06.206 --> 10:07.305
by having sex with you.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.074
No, thanks.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.976
I'm at this hospital
for more serious reasons.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.247
Oh, by the way...

10:16.249 --> 10:17.949
I'd stay far away

10:42.113 --> 10:44.246
I'm bored sitting around

10:44.248 --> 10:46.148
Why don't you guys
have any cable?

10:46.150 --> 10:47.950
We're millennials--
no one has cable.

10:47.952 --> 10:49.151
That still doesn't
answer my question

10:49.153 --> 10:51.020
about your standing
over my bed with a knife!

10:51.022 --> 10:52.287
I told you, I'm bored.
When I get bored,

10:52.289 --> 10:54.256
I start to think of ways
of how to murder people!

10:54.258 --> 10:56.959
If you don't give me
something useful to do

10:56.961 --> 10:58.260
with my time here,
at least one person

10:58.262 --> 10:59.361
in this house is gonna die.

CHANEL:
<i>Oh, Dean Munsch?</i>

11:03.267 --> 11:05.267
Uh, I have a
confession to make.

11:05.269 --> 11:07.202
I had Hester
move in with us

11:07.204 --> 11:08.337
to help us figure out
who the killer is

11:08.339 --> 11:10.272
and keep us
from getting killed.

11:10.274 --> 11:13.275
(sighs) Well, that seems
like a pretty dumb plan.

11:13.277 --> 11:14.977
It wasn't clearly
thought out.

11:14.979 --> 11:16.311
Anyway, I have a couple
of favors to ask you.

11:16.313 --> 11:18.013
First, please don't
turn us into the authorities

11:18.015 --> 11:19.181
like you promised.
I mean,

11:19.183 --> 11:20.349
all that will do is
make them ask questions

11:20.351 --> 11:22.017
about where
Denise Hemphill is.

11:22.019 --> 11:24.019
Well, since that
benefits me, I agree.

11:24.021 --> 11:25.954
Well, so does the second one.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.322
If we don't give Hester
something interesting to do,

11:27.324 --> 11:28.957
she is gonna
murder someone.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.292
Maybe even someone
who actually matters,

11:30.294 --> 11:32.995
like me or you.

11:32.997 --> 11:34.997
Okay, Hester has proven
to have no problem

11:34.999 --> 11:36.999
with blood and guts,
and she has way less empathy

11:37.001 --> 11:38.233
than any of us.

11:38.235 --> 11:40.235
I mean, I think she'd
make an excellent surgeon.

11:40.237 --> 11:43.172
I cannot let Hester
operate on patients!

11:43.174 --> 11:45.040
What? You let the Chanels
and I treat people

11:45.042 --> 11:46.341
and the only science class
I took in college

11:46.343 --> 11:49.044
was "Great Works
of Science Fiction."

11:49.046 --> 11:50.979
There is another option.

11:50.981 --> 11:52.081
<i>Here's the deal, Hester.</i>

11:52.083 --> 11:54.249
I am going to allow you
out of your cage

11:54.251 --> 11:56.185
only as long as you
remain useful.

11:56.187 --> 11:59.388
And I don't mean just helping us
find the serial killer.

11:59.390 --> 12:02.157
Because at the rate you are
dribbling out information,

12:02.159 --> 12:05.360
the entire staff will be dead
before he or she is caught.

12:05.362 --> 12:07.162
I'm sure if you give me
something cool to do,

12:07.164 --> 12:08.931
I'll tell you who it is
by Thanksgiving.

12:08.933 --> 12:10.099
I was hoping that
I could volunteer

12:10.101 --> 12:11.100
at the morgue.

12:11.102 --> 12:12.901
Listen.

12:12.903 --> 12:14.269
We have too many patients
and not enough people

12:14.271 --> 12:16.038
to figure out
what's wrong with them.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.239
So, I'm going to give you one.

12:17.241 --> 12:20.008
We here at the C.U.R.E.
Institute diagnose

12:20.010 --> 12:21.076
and cure the incurable.

12:21.078 --> 12:22.344
So, if you can achieve

12:22.346 --> 12:24.179
both those goals,

12:24.181 --> 12:26.915
I will allow you to stay free
another week.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.383
Huh.

12:28.385 --> 12:30.185

12:40.231 --> 12:42.164
Her name is...

12:43.134 --> 12:44.233
Donna Summer.

12:44.235 --> 12:46.268
Nice to meet you.

12:46.270 --> 12:48.303
And I don't need to look
at your chart to tell you

12:48.305 --> 12:50.305
that you suffer from an acute
case of "douchy guy that thinks

12:50.307 --> 12:52.274
that dressing like a
vampire is sexy." Well,

12:52.276 --> 12:54.243
let me cure you right now
and tell you that it's not.

12:54.245 --> 12:56.078
Because unless you're
'90s Tom Cruise

12:56.080 --> 12:58.113
or Brad Pitt, you just
look like Corey Feldman.

12:58.115 --> 13:00.048

13:00.050 --> 13:02.384
I have been my whole life.

13:02.386 --> 13:04.987
my skin starts to blister

13:04.989 --> 13:06.321
My eyes can't handle
bright light, and...

13:06.323 --> 13:08.323
look at my teeth.

13:09.927 --> 13:11.994
What about garlic?

13:11.996 --> 13:14.129
Can't stand it.
Mirrors?

13:14.131 --> 13:16.932
That one seems to be
an old wives' tale.

13:16.934 --> 13:18.167
We can see
our reflections.

13:18.169 --> 13:20.169
And I'm obsessed
with blood.

13:20.171 --> 13:21.270
I can't get enough of it.

13:21.272 --> 13:23.338
I drink it like iced tea.

13:23.340 --> 13:24.940
I don't hurt
anyone, though.

13:24.942 --> 13:27.009
I have an in

13:27.011 --> 13:28.110

13:28.112 --> 13:30.179

13:30.181 --> 13:31.947
You look pale.

13:31.949 --> 13:34.116
Are you anemic? Because
that's a major turn-off for me.

13:34.118 --> 13:35.918
He's right.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.153

some tests on you.

17:04.962 --> 17:06.895
chlamydia, gonorrhea,

17:06.896 --> 17:07.963
hepatitis...

17:07.964 --> 17:09.164
A, B and C.

17:09.165 --> 17:11.967
...uh, genital
warts, HPV,

17:11.969 --> 17:14.368
vaginosis, pelvic
inflammatory disease,

17:14.371 --> 17:16.003
herpes...

17:16.006 --> 17:17.906
The bad kind,
not the cold sore kind.

17:17.907 --> 17:18.906
No.

17:18.909 --> 17:21.042
Also the cold sore kind.

17:21.045 --> 17:23.045
Vaginal yeast,
male genital yeast,

17:23.047 --> 17:24.913
chancroid,
trichomoniasis,

17:24.915 --> 17:27.915
(whispers):
and good old-fashioned crabs.

17:27.917 --> 17:30.085
That's not a disease per Se,
but there was a crab

17:30.087 --> 17:32.220
just floating in the sample.

17:32.222 --> 17:35.157
Okay. I-I don't understand
how this is possible.

17:35.159 --> 17:37.159
I've occasionally
used condoms.

17:37.161 --> 17:39.161
I mean, this-this
can't be happening.

17:39.163 --> 17:40.328
Unfortunately,

17:40.330 --> 17:42.164
you're of a generation
who's obsessed

17:42.166 --> 17:43.932
with instant gratification,

17:43.934 --> 17:45.934
who simply
do not take

17:45.936 --> 17:49.171
the long-term risks
of venereal disease seriously.

17:49.173 --> 17:50.906
I'm afraid
your blood

17:50.908 --> 17:53.075
is gonna have to be removed
from the tally.

17:53.077 --> 17:55.243
Oh, and I...
I guess

17:55.245 --> 17:57.379
that puts me in the lead?

17:57.381 --> 17:59.181
But Blood Island!

17:59.183 --> 18:00.916
Uh, I don't think it's fair

18:00.918 --> 18:02.284
to penalize Chanel for this.

19:47.995 --> 19:49.328
Please leave me alone.

19:49.330 --> 19:51.897
Well, you don't even
have to come in, okay?

19:51.899 --> 19:53.899
I'd be more than happy
to come collect the sample

19:53.901 --> 19:55.901
right here at home--
it'll be like Domino's.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.336
(chuckles):
But blood instead of pizza.

19:57.338 --> 19:59.905
Domino's delivers pizza
to your house.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.241
You would be coming
to take blood from my body.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.244
It's nothing like Domino's.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.012
Um...

20:07.014 --> 20:09.014
well... how about you
just come in, then?

20:09.016 --> 20:10.182
I'll drive you.

20:10.184 --> 20:12.351
That hospital is evil.

20:12.353 --> 20:17.056
And if it were up to me, it
would be burnt to the ground.

(grunts)

20:37.011 --> 20:39.078
Good news.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.181
I think I've diagnosed
your disease. Okay.

20:42.183 --> 20:43.382
It's called

20:43.384 --> 20:44.917
non-acute porphyria,

20:44.919 --> 20:46.352
or cutaneous porphyria.

20:46.354 --> 20:48.921
It's caused by a chemical
substance called porphyrins

20:48.923 --> 20:51.257
that accumulate in your system
because of the deficiency

20:51.259 --> 20:54.393
of the enzymes that transform
the porphyrins in your blood.

20:54.395 --> 20:56.395
Is it curable?
No. Sorry.

20:56.397 --> 20:58.230
However,
cutaneous porphyria

20:58.232 --> 20:59.932
does cause
extreme photosensitivity,

20:59.934 --> 21:01.300
which would explain
why you get blisters

21:01.302 --> 21:03.102
when you stand
in direct sunlight.

21:03.104 --> 21:04.937
It also causes
receding gums,

21:04.939 --> 21:06.372
which would explain
your apparent fangs,

21:06.374 --> 21:08.274
and an odd aversion
to the smell of garlic.

21:08.276 --> 21:11.076
So I'm cursed forever,
just like Count Dracula.

21:11.078 --> 21:12.378
No, you're not.
Because one thing

21:12.380 --> 21:14.380
that your incurable disease
does not cause

21:14.382 --> 21:16.148
is the need to drink blood.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.983
That's just because
you're crazy,

21:17.985 --> 21:19.151
which I can cure you of.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.953
When I was little,

21:20.955 --> 21:22.254
I was obsessed with Ring-Dings.

21:22.256 --> 21:24.156
You know those
little snack cakes

21:24.158 --> 21:26.325
with the cream filling and the
dark chocolate on the outside?

21:26.327 --> 21:28.227
I couldn't get enough.

21:28.229 --> 21:30.929
But my aunt who raised me
thought they were unhealthy,

21:30.931 --> 21:33.065
so she told me
I couldn't have them anymore.

21:33.067 --> 21:35.267
That didn't work--
I just ate them in secret.

21:35.269 --> 21:37.102
Until she caught me,
and she realized

21:37.104 --> 21:39.271
the only way to get me
to stop eating them

21:39.273 --> 21:41.340
would be to make me hate them.

21:41.342 --> 21:45.277
So she sat me down and she made
me eat them for days and weeks

21:45.279 --> 21:48.347
until just the thought of a
Ring-Ding made me want to puke.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.250
It's called aversion therapy.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.162
We are gonna make you
drink blood all day and night

22:03.164 --> 22:05.297
until you hate it--
even more than

22:05.299 --> 22:07.032
a normal person would.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.200
Now, drink up.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.002
Doctor's orders.

22:14.108 --> 22:15.274
Mmm.

22:15.276 --> 22:17.176
That's fresh.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.081
But I don't think that's going
to be enough to do the job.

22:30.991 --> 22:32.124
Hi.

22:32.126 --> 22:33.892
Excuse me.
Um, do you test

22:33.894 --> 22:36.028
all of your blood for diseases
like goat herpes and stuff

22:36.030 --> 22:37.229
before sending it off
to the hospital?

22:37.231 --> 22:39.331
Of course. We hold it
until we get the results.

22:39.333 --> 22:42.067
And we always inform the donor
if anything comes up.

22:42.069 --> 22:45.003
Terrific. I would love

lady named Jane Hollis

I'm really busy.
I got to go.

25:47.922 --> 25:50.389

sample, too-- is that right?

That's some really good
gumshoeing, Miss Williams.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.326

25:54.328 --> 25:55.994
and the blood type
of her husband,

25:55.996 --> 25:57.029
you can cross-reference
the blood

25:57.031 --> 25:58.196
of the whole entire staff,

25:58.198 --> 25:59.932
see if you get a match.

25:59.934 --> 26:02.067
How'd you figure all that out?

26:02.069 --> 26:04.336
Because I was thinking
the same thing!

26:04.338 --> 26:06.204
This is what
I'm trying to tell you.

26:06.206 --> 26:09.041
We could figure this out
if we work as a team.

26:09.043 --> 26:11.176
Her husband's blood type
is O positive, by the way.

26:11.178 --> 26:12.978
I checked the hospital records.

26:15.382 --> 26:18.050
L-Look, here, take a
sample of my blood, okay?

26:18.052 --> 26:19.251
And test it.

26:19.253 --> 26:20.953
It'll prove I'm not the killer.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.089

26:53.925 --> 26:55.958

According to my records,
you've only given 15 pints

26:58.162 --> 27:00.262
in the last three days,
and the human heart pumps over

27:00.264 --> 27:03.099
a million barrels of blood in a
person's lifetime, so, really,

27:03.101 --> 27:05.001
you've only given a fraction
of what you can.

27:05.003 --> 27:07.336
Yeah. A fraction of what
I can give in a lifetime.

27:07.338 --> 27:10.172
The human body
only carries ten pints!

27:10.174 --> 27:12.241
Yes, but people
living at high altitudes

27:12.243 --> 27:13.976

two more pints

living at sea level.

very clearly that when
a Kappa sister needs a pledge

27:38.336 --> 27:41.003
to perform a service
that will assist said sister

27:41.005 --> 27:43.272
in winning a competition
or contest of any kind,

27:43.274 --> 27:46.175

but to oblige.

Okay, first of all,
we're not in a sorority,

27:49.113 --> 27:50.212

27:51.349 --> 27:53.215

27:57.388 --> 28:00.289
Fine. I made it up.

28:16.374 --> 28:19.075
It'll be
a dream come true.

28:19.077 --> 28:21.177
But I can't give that to you
if you're gonna keep being

28:21.179 --> 28:23.212
so selfish-- you have
to give something to me.

28:23.214 --> 28:25.247
Namely, like,
three pints of your blood.

28:25.249 --> 28:28.217
I told you,
I hate needles.

28:28.219 --> 28:31.187
I am the best phlebotomist
in town.

28:31.189 --> 28:33.155
If you're ever gonna get over
your fear of needles

28:33.157 --> 28:35.091
and fully commit
to your lame, Goth lifestyle,

28:35.093 --> 28:38.060
letting me gently stick one in
you's gonna be your best chance.

28:39.030 --> 28:40.396
(sighs)

28:43.167 --> 28:46.936
I don't understand why you have
to strap me down in here.

28:46.938 --> 28:49.038
Someone who's as freaked out
by needles as you are

28:49.040 --> 28:51.907
is probably gonna flinch like
crazy when I try to put it in.

28:51.909 --> 28:53.275
The more you move,
the more it hurts,

28:53.277 --> 28:55.277
so this is for your safety.
And we're doing it in here

28:55.279 --> 28:57.446
because it's the only place
with strong enough straps.

28:58.916 --> 29:00.015
You see how small?

29:00.017 --> 29:01.283
I am gonna
count to three.

29:01.285 --> 29:03.385
One...
(yells)

29:03.387 --> 29:05.121
(sobbing)

29:07.225 --> 29:09.058
Done.
Wait.

29:09.060 --> 29:11.093
What? That was it?

29:11.095 --> 29:13.295
Uh, I didn't
feel that at all.

29:13.297 --> 29:15.364
I told you, I am the best.

29:15.366 --> 29:17.366
Oh, my God. Thank you, Chanel.

29:17.368 --> 29:19.935
This is the best day

29:19.937 --> 29:22.104
of my life.
(exhales)

29:27.378 --> 29:29.111
Hey, wait.

29:29.113 --> 29:31.313
Don't you need to measure
how much you take?

29:31.315 --> 29:33.249
CHANEL:
Dr. Holt.

29:33.251 --> 29:35.084
Chanel, what are you
doing here? It's late.

29:35.086 --> 29:37.052
Everyone's gone home.
I just want you to know

29:37.054 --> 29:39.054
that I know for a fact
that those STD tests

29:39.056 --> 29:40.289
were manipulated in some way.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.391
I mean, there's no way
I have sexual Ebola

29:42.393 --> 29:44.260
or vaginal Zika.

29:44.262 --> 29:46.262
I doubt if those things
are even real.

29:46.264 --> 29:48.330
I'm a doctor. Tests don't lie.

29:48.332 --> 29:52.334
Well, they do if someone named
Dr. Dean Jealous Gray Pubes

29:52.336 --> 29:54.970
manipulated
my blood sample.

29:54.972 --> 29:58.174
Please. All I want is to go
to Blood Island with you

29:58.176 --> 30:00.276
and rock your sexual world.

30:00.278 --> 30:02.978
I mean, I know you've been
with hundreds of girls...

30:02.980 --> 30:04.079
Thousands.

30:04.081 --> 30:05.948
Whatever.

30:05.950 --> 30:08.083
I'm fine with you
wearing a condom.

30:08.085 --> 30:09.351
No, no. I...

30:09.353 --> 30:12.354
Look, until you prove to me
that you're completely healthy,

30:12.356 --> 30:15.090
I just can't let you
get up in all this.

30:15.092 --> 30:16.325
I can't.

30:16.327 --> 30:17.426
Oh...

30:19.931 --> 30:22.164
No! Why?

30:22.166 --> 30:26.168
Why, God, do bad things
always happen to me?

30:26.170 --> 30:27.169
I mean...

30:27.171 --> 30:30.172
(hoarsely):
I am such a good person.

30:30.174 --> 30:32.274
(clacking, squeaking)

30:32.276 --> 30:35.044
Chanel, is that you?

30:42.286 --> 30:43.986
No!

30:43.988 --> 30:47.156
Help! Help!

30:47.158 --> 30:49.124
(screams)

30:49.126 --> 30:52.061
(muffled screaming, gasping)

30:54.065 --> 30:57.233
(muffled gasping)

30:57.235 --> 30:58.968
(screaming)

31:03.040 --> 31:05.140
(muffled screams continue)

31:07.211 --> 31:10.346
(muffled screaming, sobbing)

31:10.348 --> 31:12.248
Hello, handsome.

31:13.918 --> 31:15.918
Oh, don't worry.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.920
I-I'm not here to stop you.

31:17.922 --> 31:19.355
(muffled grunt)

31:19.357 --> 31:21.357
I'm on the same team.

31:21.359 --> 31:25.060
How about you take off that mask
so we can have a real talk?

31:26.264 --> 31:28.097
(whimpering)
Oh, don't worry about her.

31:28.099 --> 31:30.266
She'll be dead before she
can tell anyone who you are.

31:30.268 --> 31:32.134
(muffled sobbing)

31:44.916 --> 31:46.982
Wow, you have a problem.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.921
Zayday's getting
close, yes?

31:51.923 --> 31:53.923
I was gonna kill
her next, but...

31:53.925 --> 31:55.257
she kind of scares me.

31:55.259 --> 31:57.293
Let's make a deal.

31:57.295 --> 32:01.263
You just keep on being
the muscle in this operation,

32:01.265 --> 32:03.198
and you let me be the brains.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.134
I think I'm doing just fine
in that department.

32:05.136 --> 32:07.970
Please. Who the hell thinks
the best way to shut down

32:07.972 --> 32:10.039
the hospital's
by killing all the patients?

32:10.041 --> 32:12.241
How about killing
the nurses or the doctors

32:12.243 --> 32:14.076
or the damn woman
running the place?

32:14.078 --> 32:17.079
I-I've tried, but they're all
so hard to kill.

32:17.081 --> 32:18.247
(whimpering)

32:18.249 --> 32:20.115
So what's in it for you?

32:20.117 --> 32:23.218
The Chanels.

32:23.220 --> 32:24.987
You don't touch them.

32:24.989 --> 32:26.155
They're all mine.

32:28.326 --> 32:30.159
(muffled grunting)

32:30.161 --> 32:32.061
I can work with that.

32:33.130 --> 32:35.264
Would you mind if I...

32:35.266 --> 32:37.166
helped you out on this one?

32:38.135 --> 32:39.301
Just for fun?

32:39.303 --> 32:41.003
(muffled yelling)

32:42.940 --> 32:45.207
By all means.

32:46.010 --> 32:48.310
(muffled grunting)

32:51.349 --> 32:53.415
So you're
the other Green Meanie

32:53.417 --> 32:55.951
that's been killing people
around here?

32:55.953 --> 32:57.319
I haven't killed
anyone here yet.

32:57.321 --> 32:59.154
What are you
talking about?

32:59.156 --> 33:01.156
Well, I didn't kill
all the victims.

33:01.158 --> 33:03.192
There's someone else
running around here

33:03.194 --> 33:05.928
killing people, too.

33:05.930 --> 33:08.330
Hmm. Shall we?

33:08.332 --> 33:10.933
Ladies first.

33:10.935 --> 33:12.234
(screaming)

33:13.971 --> 33:17.172
(continues screaming)

33:20.281 --> 33:24.017
HESTER:
<i>What to do, what to do.</i>

33:25.153 --> 33:27.020
<i>I need blood.</i>

33:27.022 --> 33:31.024
<i>And these patients would be</i>
so <i> easy to murder.</i>

33:31.960 --> 33:33.359
No.

33:33.361 --> 33:35.895
Hester, you promised no killing.

33:35.897 --> 33:39.332
<i>But where can I get the blood</i>
<i>I need to treat Vampire Guy</i>

33:39.334 --> 33:42.969
<i>so Dean Munsch</i>
<i>doesn't lock me up again?</i>

33:53.014 --> 33:55.214
Oh, hey. You're...

33:55.216 --> 33:56.916
you're Hester, right?

33:56.918 --> 33:58.217
The girl who murdered
a bunch of folks

33:58.219 --> 33:59.919
and was locked in a cage
downstairs

33:59.921 --> 34:01.988
but then they let you out
for some reason

34:01.990 --> 34:03.056
and now you sort of work here?

34:03.058 --> 34:04.991
That's right.

34:04.993 --> 34:06.325
Okay.

34:09.097 --> 34:11.330
Uh, hey, wh-what are you doing

34:11.331 --> 34:13.232
with those pints
of blood?
Oh, these?

34:13.234 --> 34:15.234
These are headed
to the bio-hazard Dumpster.

34:15.235 --> 34:17.003
You mean the swamp.

34:17.005 --> 34:18.337
Yeah, the swamp.
They're the pints of blood

34:18.339 --> 34:21.074
that Chanel donated,
but evidently they're crawling

34:21.076 --> 34:24.077
with every type of STD,
so nobody can use them.

34:24.079 --> 34:26.012
Nice meeting you.

34:31.052 --> 34:34.387
(sighs) All right, stupid,
tiny, Goth bitch, let's see

34:34.389 --> 34:36.989
if you've put me over the top.

34:39.194 --> 34:41.260
(screaming)

34:42.931 --> 34:45.063
Hey! What happened?

34:45.065 --> 34:46.299
Wha...?
Oh, my God.

34:46.301 --> 34:49.368
This poor gir...
Wait, who is she again?

34:49.370 --> 34:52.038
Chanel #9 or 10 or 11,

34:52.040 --> 34:54.107
I don't know-- at a certain
point you just lose count.

34:54.109 --> 34:57.977
Well, why'd you hook her up
to all these... blood bags?

34:57.979 --> 34:59.112
This is weird.

34:59.114 --> 35:01.280
Me? I didn't do this!

35:01.282 --> 35:03.216
I heard screaming!

35:07.922 --> 35:10.056
Damn it!

35:10.058 --> 35:12.925
(exhales)
You know, at some point,

35:12.927 --> 35:15.328
this swamp is gonna be,
like, 90% dead bodies.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.396
Wait a second.

35:17.398 --> 35:20.299
Chanel #9 was my patient, right?

35:20.301 --> 35:23.169
Well, it looks like she gave
about two dozen bags of blood,

35:23.171 --> 35:24.337
which means I am back

35:24.339 --> 35:27.406
in the lead, which means
we are going on our romantic,

35:27.408 --> 35:31.110
luxurious, all-expense-paid
vacation to Blood Island!

35:31.112 --> 35:33.346
No. A-- you're going
to Blood Island alone,

35:33.348 --> 35:36.015
because I'm still creeped
out about those STD's;

35:36.017 --> 35:37.083
and two--

35:37.085 --> 35:38.351
aren't you a little upset

35:38.353 --> 35:40.319
that your friend
just got murdered?

35:40.321 --> 35:42.255
Meh.

35:42.257 --> 35:43.356
MUNSCH:
It was Hester.

35:43.358 --> 35:46.159
Hester did this.

35:46.161 --> 35:48.027
She needed blood
for Vampire Guy,

35:48.029 --> 35:50.930
and she's a serial killer.
Come on, let's go look for her.

35:50.932 --> 35:51.931
Come on.
(groans)

35:51.933 --> 35:53.099
She's a what?

35:53.101 --> 35:54.333
Just one more spoonful.

35:54.335 --> 35:56.035
You know you want it.

35:56.037 --> 35:58.004
Open up the tunnel
for the blood train.

35:58.006 --> 36:00.940
No, I-I never want any blood
again, not even a bloody Mary.

36:00.942 --> 36:03.109
I'm cured! I'm cured!
MUNSCH: Hester!

36:03.111 --> 36:05.945
Where did you get that blood?
And before

36:05.947 --> 36:07.180
you answer,
please remember we have

36:07.182 --> 36:09.115
a patient present,
so if your answer is

36:09.117 --> 36:11.951
by killing someone and draining
all the blood from their body,

36:11.953 --> 36:14.020
please, say it in code.

36:14.022 --> 36:15.121
Wait, what?

36:15.123 --> 36:16.389
I'm offended by that accusation.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.958
Though to be fair,
it is warranted.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.026
That being said,
I didn't kill anyone

36:20.028 --> 36:21.194
in the service
of getting this blood.

36:21.196 --> 36:22.328
I got it from Chamberlain.

36:22.330 --> 36:24.030
He was just gonna
dump it in the swamp.

36:24.032 --> 36:25.231
You fed him Chanel's blood?

36:25.233 --> 36:27.066
Geez, you should have
just fed him cyanide.

36:27.068 --> 36:28.067
BRANDON:
I-Is there something wrong

36:28.069 --> 36:29.969
with that blood?
I-I drank,

36:29.971 --> 36:31.337
like, three vials of it.

36:31.339 --> 36:33.072
(groans)
No, nothing wrong per Se,

36:33.074 --> 36:37.009
unless you consider having every
diagnosable STD in it "wrong"?

36:37.011 --> 36:40.346
Oh! At the moment I have been
cured of my need to drink blood

36:40.348 --> 36:42.248
and pretend to be
a douchy vampire,

36:42.250 --> 36:45.017
I'm cursed with being
a sexual pariah.
Honey,

36:45.019 --> 36:46.352
you are a pale weirdo
with receding gums

36:46.354 --> 36:48.087
who can't eat
at an ethnic restaurant!

36:48.089 --> 36:50.356
You're a pariah
with or without an STD!

36:50.358 --> 36:52.358
Fortunately,
you don't have one.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.261
I checked the blood before
I gave it to him. It's clean.

36:55.263 --> 36:57.363
Free of any and all STD's.
(relieved sigh)

36:57.365 --> 36:59.031
What?

36:59.033 --> 37:01.200
(pants)

37:01.202 --> 37:03.102
I'm shocked.

37:03.104 --> 37:04.270
Uh...

37:04.272 --> 37:05.371
uh...
Oh, I knew

37:05.373 --> 37:07.206
you were behind this!

37:07.208 --> 37:09.242
Oh, I am gonna get you.

37:09.244 --> 37:12.211
When you least expect it,
I am going to get you.

37:12.213 --> 37:15.214
HOFFEL: Chanel? I've been
looking all over for you.

37:15.216 --> 37:17.116
Congratulations.

37:17.118 --> 37:19.185
The extra blood you submitted
by totally exsanguinating

37:19.187 --> 37:22.355
Chanel #9 has officially
taken you past

37:22.357 --> 37:25.191
the arbitrary
yet official finish line.

37:25.193 --> 37:28.194
You win the blood drive.

37:28.196 --> 37:30.263
I'm going to Blood Island?

37:30.265 --> 37:32.298
HOFFEL: You bet your
tiny ass you are!

37:32.300 --> 37:35.167
♪ ♪

37:37.071 --> 37:38.938
And these two

37:38.940 --> 37:40.239
are for the other Chanels.

37:40.241 --> 37:42.141
Oh. Thank you.
I'm gonna need one more,

37:42.143 --> 37:44.143
because now that
I am officially STD-free,

37:44.145 --> 37:46.946
I think a certain someone
is gonna want

37:46.948 --> 37:48.981
to come with me-- and
yes, I do mean that

37:48.983 --> 37:50.983
as a euphemism.

37:51.986 --> 37:54.253
And here are your plane tickets.

37:54.255 --> 37:56.322
"Business select"?

37:56.324 --> 37:58.924
(chuckles)
I only fly charter.

37:58.926 --> 38:00.092
Ooh!

38:00.094 --> 38:02.228
I... can't afford...

38:02.230 --> 38:04.130
a charter jet.
Well, that's okay.

38:04.132 --> 38:05.931
I'll just take
the cash-equivalency option

38:05.933 --> 38:07.233
and go on my own trip.

38:07.235 --> 38:09.001
What? I can't afford that.

38:09.003 --> 38:10.970
I've already maxed out
all my credit cards

38:10.972 --> 38:12.938
just to be able
to afford this trip.

38:12.940 --> 38:14.940
You have to go to Blood Island!

38:14.942 --> 38:17.109
Oh, you have to honor
the terms of the contest

38:17.111 --> 38:21.247
that you came up with, or you
will be hearing from my lawyer.

38:31.263 --> 38:34.097
O positive, O positive,
AB negative.

38:34.099 --> 38:36.266
What are you talking about?
I checked the
hospital records.

38:36.268 --> 38:38.201
Bill Hollis' blood type
is O positive,

38:38.203 --> 38:39.936
so is Jane Hollis'.

38:39.938 --> 38:41.271
What? How'd you find that out?

38:47.179 --> 38:50.046
Jackpot.

38:50.048 --> 38:51.314
Hot pies!

38:51.316 --> 38:55.151
Come and get your hot,
delicious pies! Ooh!

38:55.153 --> 38:56.286
Ma'am,
can I tempt you

38:56.288 --> 38:59.122
with a free, delicious hot pie?

38:59.124 --> 39:00.357
Oh.

39:00.359 --> 39:03.093
Why not? (chuckles)

39:04.296 --> 39:07.030
Just, what kind of pie is this?

39:07.032 --> 39:09.065
Worm pie.

39:09.067 --> 39:11.034
It's worm. Yep. Ew.

39:11.036 --> 39:13.169
You know, you can get a blood
type from a saliva sample

39:13.171 --> 39:16.973
using an indirect enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay

39:16.975 --> 39:19.042
using monoclonal antibodies?

39:19.044 --> 39:20.243
Whoa.

39:20.245 --> 39:22.178
Oh, yeah, and my blood type
is AB negative,

39:22.180 --> 39:24.381
so there's no way I could be
the baby in the belly.

39:24.383 --> 39:26.983
Thank the Lord!

39:26.985 --> 39:29.085
I'm so relieved!

39:29.087 --> 39:30.920
I knew it couldn't be you.

39:30.922 --> 39:32.989
I'm so sorry I
ever doubted you.

39:32.991 --> 39:34.257
Oh, wait a minute.

39:34.259 --> 39:37.227
You know what that means,
don't you?

39:37.229 --> 39:40.296
The baby in the belly
has to be O positive.

BROCK:
<i>I don't understand.</i>

40:10.929 --> 40:15.031
You're the only man on staff
with type O positive blood.

40:15.033 --> 40:16.399
Really? (chuckles)
Yes.

40:16.401 --> 40:20.303
Which is the same type
as a man named Bill Hollis,

40:20.305 --> 40:22.205
who most likely
was murdered here

40:22.207 --> 40:23.373
30 years ago,

40:23.375 --> 40:25.275
as well as his wife,
Jane Hollis,

40:25.277 --> 40:27.310
who was with child at the time.

40:27.312 --> 40:31.114
That child would also have
type O positive blood,

40:31.116 --> 40:34.250
as well as a motive to murder
everyone here at the hospital.

40:34.252 --> 40:36.252
So... you're suggesting

40:36.254 --> 40:39.088
that I was that baby
they were pregnant with?

40:39.090 --> 40:41.224
(laughs) Well, I'm just,
like, very flattered

40:41.226 --> 40:43.326
that you all think
I look 30, but...

40:43.328 --> 40:46.930
you do realize
this is insane, right?

40:46.932 --> 40:49.999
Yeah. Well, you do bone down
like a 30-year-old.

I mean, you be, like,

40:51.269 --> 40:53.136

50-year-old ever.

40:53.138 --> 40:54.938
You're, like, suspiciously
handsome, dude.

40:54.940 --> 40:56.172
Exactly.

40:56.174 --> 40:59.008
Maybe you spent every summer
for 30 years at the pool.

40:59.010 --> 41:01.244
Maybe as a teenager,
you were a lifeguard

41:01.246 --> 41:04.113
and suffered severe
sun damage.
All right.

41:04.115 --> 41:07.016
I-I get it,
I am ridiculously handsome

41:07.018 --> 41:10.019
and I do have an air
of youthfulness about me, but...

41:10.021 --> 41:12.021
O positive is the most common
blood type there is.

41:12.023 --> 41:13.990
40% of the people
on this Earth have it.

41:13.992 --> 41:15.925
I mean, it's weird
that I'm the only one

41:15.927 --> 41:17.093
in the hospital that has it.

41:17.095 --> 41:20.263
And yet this is
where we find ourselves.

41:20.265 --> 41:23.032
The proof is in the pudding.

41:23.034 --> 41:25.969
Or as I should say, the proof
is in the <i> blood</i> pudding.

41:25.971 --> 41:28.371
No. Actually,
I shouldn't.

41:28.373 --> 41:31.107
And I apologize
for going for the pun.

Dr. Holt... science
doesn't lie, and as far

as I'm concerned,
at this point

you are the prime suspect.

41:41.386 --> 41:43.186

41:43.188 --> 41:47.290
This is an outrage,

You morons
don't deserve to live.

41:49.294 --> 41:53.029
(panting): You want to accuse me
of murder, you go right ahead.

41:53.965 --> 41:56.199
But there will be consequences.

42:10.081 --> 42:11.981
You startled me.

Ooh. For me?
