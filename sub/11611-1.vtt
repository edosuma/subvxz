02:19.480 --> 02:22.780
All right, hold it!
Oh, sorry, lieutenant.

02:24.740 --> 02:27.580
All right,
it's 2 a.m. in New Orleans,

02:27.620 --> 02:31.420
The big easy.
And we're stirring up that gumbo!

02:34.340 --> 02:39.100
Hey, Remy!
Hey, Teeneg, where you at?

02:39.140 --> 02:41.980
Where you been,
don't you ever go home?

02:42.020 --> 02:46.780
Only when the music stops, Cher.
Hey, who's the dead meat?

02:46.820 --> 02:49.660
As long as you're here,
let's see if you can make him.

02:51.620 --> 02:55.420
Oh man, yeah. Hello, Freddy.
That's Freddy Angelo, wise-guy scumbag,

02:55.460 --> 02:59.180
Works for Eddie Di Moti.
He handles Mexican imports for the family.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.980
Mama!
Can't find any bullet hits, spent shells,

03:04.060 --> 03:05.900
Nothing like that?
very little blood.

03:05.980 --> 03:09.740
We figure they lit him up some place
else, then brought his body here.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.620
Here's his wallet.
They just lifted the prints.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.540
Oh-huh!

03:14.620 --> 03:17.420
Oh, the drivers license
is missing!

03:17.500 --> 03:19.340
I guess they took it for
proof of their hit.

03:19.420 --> 03:20.980
Standard wise-guy
procedure, right, Remy?

03:21.060 --> 03:23.060
If you're gonna wrap
'em in a concrete overcoat

03:23.140 --> 03:24.900
and dump 'em in
lake Pontchartrain.

03:24.980 --> 03:26.700
But here's Freddy,
dead as Kelsey's nuts,

03:26.780 --> 03:28.820
right in the middle
of the Piazza D'Italia.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.340
Now what does that tell us, huh?

03:32.860 --> 03:36.620
Somebody is sending a message.
To the esteemed president

03:36.700 --> 03:38.540
of the Italian-American
Renaissance Association.

03:38.620 --> 03:41.420
Vinnie "The Cannon" Di Moti.
There you go.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.300
I want you to pick up
Vinnie "The Cannon"

03:44.380 --> 03:48.140
tomorrow morning at his barbershop
and bring him in for questioning.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.740
Hi, Remy.

03:55.820 --> 03:58.620
Cavenaugh, where you at?
I'm doing it.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.500
What is this, the Dodge and
De Soto Follies?

04:02.540 --> 04:04.420
Who would know what
you're thinking about?

04:04.460 --> 04:07.300
Captain, it was Andre's idea.

04:07.340 --> 04:10.180
Is he the brains of
the partnership now?

04:10.220 --> 04:13.020
Hey, what did they do now?
Impounded a boat.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.940
They spent half their shift at
the damned police dock.

04:15.980 --> 04:16.899
What am I going to
do with them?

04:16.980 --> 04:19.060
Why don't we shoot 'em?
Yeah!

04:19.140 --> 04:23.620
No, they're too much fun at Mardi Gras.
Who's that in my office?

04:23.660 --> 04:27.460
Assistant district attorney,
Anne Osborne.

04:27.500 --> 04:31.300
Hmmm, nice neck!
We have written orders to cooperate.

04:31.340 --> 04:36.100
Her be part of the special task force
that's investigating police corruption.

04:36.140 --> 04:38.980
Where did she get
that idea, huh?

04:39.020 --> 04:41.860
She says she's here about
the Angelo murder.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.780
So I'm gonna get myself
some real coffee,

04:43.820 --> 04:45.700
and you're going to give her
whatever she needs.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.620
She's in good hands, Cher.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.260
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

04:54.340 --> 04:55.220
Oh!

04:56.260 --> 05:00.980
Anne, hi.
I'm Remy McSwain.

05:01.060 --> 05:01.940
Oh!

05:02.020 --> 05:03.860
Ouch!

05:04.900 --> 05:06.740
Your pencil.

05:06.820 --> 05:10.580
Lieutenant...
Ahhh, Remy.

05:10.660 --> 05:14.420
Lieutenant, I came to find out what
progress you've made on the Angelo murder.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.300
What's your hurry,
he's not even stiff yet.

05:17.380 --> 05:21.140
He is dead though, isn't he?
Oh, last time I saw him, yeah.

05:21.220 --> 05:24.980
You have no clues or leads?
Not so far.

05:25.060 --> 05:26.900
See, I've seen dozens of
these wise-guy jobs.

05:26.980 --> 05:29.780
We usually find out why
the hit went down or who did it,

05:29.860 --> 05:32.660
But we never have enough
to take to court.

05:34.660 --> 05:37.340
He wasn't at the barbershop,
so we picked him up at his home.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.380
Bring him in.

05:39.460 --> 05:42.260
Oh, thank you so much for
coming in, Mr. Di Moti.

05:42.340 --> 05:45.140
This is Miss Anne Osborne of
the district attorney's office.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.020
My lawyer is going to get me
out of here in five minutes.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.860
I got nothing to say
'til then, nothing!

05:49.940 --> 05:52.740
Why, you're not
under arrest, Mr. Di Moti.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.660
Did McCabe give you
that impression?

05:54.740 --> 05:57.540
McCabe, I want you to
apologize to Mr. Di Moti here.

05:57.620 --> 06:01.380
I'm sorry about the
misunderstanding, Mr. Di Moti.

06:01.460 --> 06:05.220
You're free to go any time you want, sir.
Again, we really do apologize.

06:06.260 --> 06:08.100
Well...

06:08.180 --> 06:10.980
We just wanted to express
our sympathy about Freddy.

06:11.060 --> 06:14.820
About who? Freddy Angelo,
the guy they found floating

06:14.900 --> 06:16.740
in the fountain last night
behind your office.

06:16.820 --> 06:19.620
Yeah, he used to work
for me, terrible!

06:19.700 --> 06:22.940
Nobody's got any respect
for monuments anymore.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.900
Mr. Di Moti, isn't it true

06:24.940 --> 06:27.100
that Mr. Angelo worked for you
for nearly 20 years,

06:27.180 --> 06:29.900
and was still in your employ
at the time of his death?

06:29.980 --> 06:32.020
Can I go?

06:36.020 --> 06:38.820
You know, kid, your father would
never drag me down here.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.740
If he wanted to see me,
he'd come to the house!

06:42.740 --> 06:46.460
He knew a little something
about respect.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.020
Get out of my way!

06:57.060 --> 07:00.380
I can't believe you were so
obsequious with that man.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.700
What does "obsequious" mean?

07:04.740 --> 07:06.620
It means you had a high-ranking
member of the Mafia

07:06.660 --> 07:09.500
in your office and
you kissed his ass.

07:09.540 --> 07:13.340
Well, let me point
out a few things to you.

07:13.380 --> 07:16.220
First of all, nobody
uses the word "Mafia" anymore.

07:16.260 --> 07:19.100
Down here we call them "wise guys."
You're not from here, are you?

07:19.140 --> 07:21.020
I only say this to save
you any kind of embarrassment.

07:21.060 --> 07:23.900
I'll bear that in mind, lieutenant.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.500
Anything else?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.420
Hey, you like spicy food?
why don't we have dinner?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.340
I know this little cajun place.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.260
Relax, Romeo.

07:33.340 --> 07:36.140
Tell me what you learned
from two minutes of ass-kissing.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.020
Actually I learned a
lot from that little interview.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.820
Do you read minds?

07:40.900 --> 07:43.260
No, I read people, and
after seeing "The Cannon,"

07:43.340 --> 07:46.140
I can probably tell you why
Freddy sprung a leak last night.

07:46.220 --> 07:48.060
I suppose you know
who the killer is, too.

07:48.140 --> 07:53.260
Oh no, but I bet we find his body
floating in the lake in a couple of weeks.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.380
Then what will you do?
Nothing.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.620
I told you we never
have enough to take to court.

07:58.700 --> 08:02.060
Hell, I'd close the case
right now except for one thing.

08:02.140 --> 08:05.620
What's that?
I'll tell you over dinner.

08:26.860 --> 08:28.660
Hey, come on, we don't
have to stand in line.

08:28.740 --> 08:31.780
Hey!
Hey, man!

08:31.860 --> 08:33.020
How embarrassing.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.580
That's what's great about being a cop.
How you doing?

08:45.660 --> 08:48.740
Hey!
All right, Willie!

08:51.660 --> 08:53.980
Come on, we're going
to work up an appetite.

08:54.020 --> 08:55.540
Hi, Remy.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.140
I thought we were
here to discuss business.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.020
Business and pleasure,
what's wrong with that?

08:59.100 --> 09:00.900
I can't do this.

09:00.980 --> 09:04.220
Wait, didn't they
dance where you come from?

09:04.300 --> 09:06.260
No, we barely spoke.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.100
This is New Orleans, doll,
the big easy.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.020
Down here dancing's
a way of life, come on.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.620
Feel the music!

09:19.300 --> 09:21.660
Now you're getting it, that's right!

09:50.020 --> 09:52.820
You see
my grandpapa on my mama's side,

09:52.900 --> 09:54.740
now he was a real cajun.

09:54.820 --> 09:58.100
Born and died on the bayoutish.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.020
I thought you came
from a family of Irish cops.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.860
No, that was on my daddy's side.
He was the first one to become a cop.

10:03.940 --> 10:06.740
Followed by three brothers,
one son and four nephews.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.660
My cousin, Terry,
joined the fire department.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.540
He's the black sheep of the family.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.460
You were the youngest detective

10:13.540 --> 10:16.340
in the history of the N.O.P.D.
to ever make lieutenant.

10:16.420 --> 10:19.220
I had an in
in the department, sugar.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.140
Careful who you say that to.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.980
Oh yeah, that's right,
you bust cops... for a living.

10:25.060 --> 10:28.820
I'm not embarrassed
to put bad cops behind bars.

10:40.340 --> 10:44.100
Why don't you tell
me something about your life.

10:44.180 --> 10:47.940
It's not as colorful as yours.
Oh yeah?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.620
Do you want me to tell you

10:55.700 --> 10:59.420
why I'm not closing the Angelo case?

11:02.140 --> 11:04.180
That's supposed to be why I'm here.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.660
It's you.
Oh please!

11:05.740 --> 11:09.460
No, no, it's you really.

11:14.900 --> 11:20.580
I mean, how come an
assistant district attorney

11:20.660 --> 11:23.460
in an official corruption
strike force

11:23.540 --> 11:26.340
is suddenly so interested
in a routine Mafia hit?

11:26.420 --> 11:28.540
Routine "wise-guy" hit,
remember?

11:28.620 --> 11:31.140
Yeah, whatever.
What gives?

11:31.220 --> 11:33.060
We have the jurisdiction
to investigate any crime.

11:33.140 --> 11:35.900
You got some kind of police
corruption angle on this case?

11:35.940 --> 11:37.820
No comment, lieutenant.

11:37.860 --> 11:40.700
You got any evidence at all?
No comment, again.

11:40.740 --> 11:44.540
Hey, Remy, how's everything?
You like that gumbo?

11:44.580 --> 11:47.420
Remy's great aunt Emeline,
she teach me my gumbo.

11:47.460 --> 11:51.260
But she uses more sassafras
filet in her gumbo.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.180
You watch your mouth, boy,
or you don't get no dessert.

11:53.220 --> 11:56.060
We got Cajun Coush-Coush,
and we got Dobas Cake.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.940
No, nothing for me, thanks.
I have to be up very early tomorrow.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.860
Yeah, we just gonna
take the check tonight, Paul.

12:00.900 --> 12:05.660
What you talking about, Cher?
I mean I want the check, Paul!

12:05.700 --> 12:07.580
Remy done lost his mind.

12:07.620 --> 12:10.460
He knows his money
is no good in here.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.380
then just give me the check.

12:12.420 --> 12:15.260
Paul, have you met Anne Osborne
with the D.A.'s office?

12:15.300 --> 12:19.100
Oh, really?
You looking for that check, Remy.

12:19.140 --> 12:20.060
Right here it is,
all the time.

12:22.020 --> 12:24.860
You honestly don't
see the harm in any of this?

12:24.900 --> 12:27.740
No, I don't see the harm,
these are the perks!

12:27.780 --> 12:30.620
But the restaurant expects
extra protection in return.

12:30.660 --> 12:31.500
Big deal!

12:31.580 --> 12:34.380
And expect the officer
to overlook any code violations.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.500
If all the codes
were enforced in this city,

12:36.580 --> 12:39.180
you wouldn't have a single
restaurant that could stay open.

12:39.260 --> 12:41.100
So now you're defending
organized corruption?

12:41.180 --> 12:44.380
I'm not defending anything,
this is New Orleans.

12:44.420 --> 12:46.860
Folks have a certain
way of doing things down here.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.740
People like to show
their appreciation.

12:48.820 --> 12:52.060
Really, how does it work?
Do you get free suits?

12:52.100 --> 12:54.260
Do you get a little envelope
from Chef Paul every week?

12:55.780 --> 12:58.100
Are you wearing a
wire in there or something?

13:09.140 --> 13:11.980
I'm serious.
How far does all this stuff go?

13:12.060 --> 13:13.500
Is everything for sale?

13:13.580 --> 13:16.460
What's it cost to beat
a murder rap these days?

13:18.540 --> 13:20.620
Is that what you think about cops?

13:22.180 --> 13:24.300
You've got a real
serious attitude problem.

13:24.380 --> 13:28.140
Being around you for
an evening hasn't improved it.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.900
I've never seen a man break
so many laws in such a short time.

13:31.980 --> 13:33.820
It's very simple when
you're out on the street.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.740
There's "good guys"
and there's "bad guys".

13:35.820 --> 13:37.660
I suppose you're the "good guys"?

13:37.740 --> 13:40.540
Damn right, and we're all
that stands between you and them.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.420
Why don't you just drop
me off at the corner up there.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.980
And don't think that
I'm naive, lieutenant.

13:54.060 --> 13:56.860
I know the way the system works,
but things can change.

13:56.940 --> 13:58.780
Oh yeah, are you going
to change it?

13:58.860 --> 14:01.020
Don't you dare
be amused at me.

14:01.060 --> 14:03.580
Hey, is this your building?
No, I live up the street.

14:03.660 --> 14:06.460
I have to get some things.
Is that okay?

14:06.540 --> 14:09.340
I'll wait for you and
drive you the rest of the way.

14:09.420 --> 14:11.260
No thank you,
I'd rather walk.

14:11.340 --> 14:14.140
I'll walk with you.

14:14.220 --> 14:17.980
No. Thank you very much for a
very illuminating evening.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.860
Stop, my purse!

14:47.780 --> 14:51.540
Ohhh!
Let's go, blood!

14:51.620 --> 14:54.420
Help, somebody help!
Let me go, woman!

14:58.340 --> 14:59.220
Police!

15:02.180 --> 15:04.020
Don't screw up!

15:06.020 --> 15:07.860
Scumbag, get your face down
on the pavement right now!

15:07.940 --> 15:09.780
You stay down there
for a second.

15:15.620 --> 15:16.500
Ah-ha, ah-ha.

15:16.580 --> 15:19.380
You a cop?
Yes, ma'am.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.260
Thank god you were here.
I just cashed my pay check.

15:22.340 --> 15:25.060
Stay here and a patrolman will
be by to take your statement.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.980
You think I'm crazy or what?

15:27.060 --> 15:29.860
I'm not taking any chances,
no police!

15:29.940 --> 15:32.420
All right.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.860
A patrol car is going to come
for you in a little while.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.900
Now if you do anything
to my car,

15:38.980 --> 15:41.660
If you even get your
fingerprints on the paint,

15:41.700 --> 15:45.220
they are going to beat
the ever-living shit out of you.

15:49.140 --> 15:50.980
Do you fully understand each
and every one of these rights

15:51.060 --> 15:53.860
as I have explained them to you?
Yes, sir.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.460
It's a good thing
I'm such a pushy guy, huh?

16:12.300 --> 16:14.020
Hey, Remy, listen to this.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.900
Remember Mrs. Williams who
stabbed her husband last week?

16:16.980 --> 16:19.780
We go see her, "Mrs. Williams,
your husband just died,"

16:19.860 --> 16:21.660
"and you're busted for
second-degree homicide."

16:21.700 --> 16:22.620
You know what she said?

16:22.660 --> 16:27.420
"That bastard, I stabbed
him before and he never died."

16:27.460 --> 16:30.300
Homicide, McSwain.
Hello, lieutenant.

16:30.340 --> 16:33.180
Hey, Anne, you must be psychic.

16:33.220 --> 16:36.060
I was just thinking about you.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.940
What's new on the Angelo case?
Not a thing.

16:38.980 --> 16:40.860
Why not, aren't you working on it?

16:40.900 --> 16:43.740
Hey, I got a poisoned
nurse in the garden district

16:43.780 --> 16:45.660
and a strangled transvestite
in the French Quarter.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.580
I got a suspicious
asphyxiation in town.

16:47.620 --> 16:50.460
Freddy Angelo has
to wait his turn.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.380
I thought the Angelo case
was supposed to be given priority.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.300
When can I see
a copy of your report?

16:54.340 --> 16:58.140
I'll tell you what, the Nevelle Brothers
are playing at Tipitina's tonight.

16:58.180 --> 17:02.940
I can give it to you then.
I was thinking that we ought to

17:02.980 --> 17:05.819
keep this relationship
strictly professional.

17:05.859 --> 17:06.780
Hey, why?

17:06.819 --> 17:09.660
I thought we passed a good
time last night.

17:09.700 --> 17:13.500
Didn't you like the music?
The music was very nice.

17:13.540 --> 17:17.900
Didn't you like the crawfish etouffee?
The food was delicious,

17:17.980 --> 17:21.980
but look, let's just forget
about last night.

17:22.020 --> 17:24.940
There's too much possibility
for conflict of interest.

17:25.020 --> 17:25.900
Oh, really?

17:25.980 --> 17:30.700
Why, are you investigating me?
Of course not, no.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.580
Why don't I pick you up at 8:00,
and don't be late?

17:33.660 --> 17:37.420
No, please just have somebody send
a copy of the report to my office.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.340
Thank you, lieutenant.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.580
Hey, Annie!

17:57.660 --> 17:59.500
What are you doing here?

17:59.580 --> 18:04.300
Hey, what the hell you doing?

18:04.380 --> 18:08.500
I got a large pizza here.
Pepperoni with extra cheese.

18:09.780 --> 18:12.340
Move your goddamned car!

18:12.420 --> 18:15.660
You can't get around me that easy.
Where's my report?

18:15.740 --> 18:17.460
Right here.
Where?

18:17.540 --> 18:21.260
Under the pizza. You got to eat
the pie to get to the report.

18:21.340 --> 18:24.260
Go on, girlie,
get in the car!

18:37.420 --> 18:41.180
You write a pretty good report.
Oh, great.

18:41.260 --> 18:43.180
Does that mean we can
go to Tipitina's now?

18:43.260 --> 18:45.100
No.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.980
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.900
Now Angelo was shot
at a downward angle.

18:49.980 --> 18:53.740
The weapon was a Mack-10 pistol.
Are you thinking dope smugglers?

18:53.820 --> 18:56.620
Possibly, but a lot of
younger wise-guys

18:56.700 --> 18:59.500
use Mack-10 pistols, too.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.420
you found his car parked way out
on Choopatalis Street.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.260
Chopatoolis Street.
Chopatoolis.

19:05.340 --> 19:08.140
But you couldn't find any
evidence of a crime, correct?

19:08.220 --> 19:10.060
Yeah, but what it doesn't
say in there is

19:10.140 --> 19:12.940
that Freddy Angelo's car
was parked across the street

19:13.020 --> 19:15.820
from a wharf warehouse owned
by Carmine Tandino,

19:15.900 --> 19:17.740
a very well-known hit man
in the family

19:17.820 --> 19:21.700
of our mutual friend,
Vinnie "The Cannon" Di Moti.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.620
I'm going to check out
that warehouse tomorrow.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.500
Why isn't that in your
report, lieutenant?

19:28.580 --> 19:31.380
We're not supposed to draw
conclusions, you know that.

19:31.460 --> 19:35.220
If someone were to ask you,
what conclusion would you draw?

19:35.300 --> 19:40.980
Well, Freddy imported
heroin for a living.

19:41.060 --> 19:43.860
Carmine Tandino's
warehouse is on the river.

19:43.940 --> 19:48.660
Sometimes heroin comes up the river.
You draw your own conclusions.

19:54.060 --> 19:57.820
What?
I'm impressed.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.740
By what?

19:59.820 --> 20:03.580
Well, you've obviously given
this a great deal of thought.

20:03.660 --> 20:07.420
You're doing a really thorough job.
Oh, thank you very much.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.780
What do you think, I do a very lousy job?
No, I didn't mean that.

20:10.860 --> 20:16.980
Why don't you like me, Anne?
I do like you.

20:17.060 --> 20:18.900
Well, why don't you trust me then?

20:18.980 --> 20:19.860
Huh?

20:21.860 --> 20:25.620
You think I'm a rotten,
don't-give-a-shit,

20:25.700 --> 20:27.540
dishonest,

20:27.620 --> 20:31.380
no-good, dirty cop.

20:31.460 --> 20:36.180
Is that what you think of me?
No.

20:36.260 --> 20:39.060
I do trust you.
I do.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.820
Ouch!

21:55.780 --> 21:57.660
Sorry.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.620
I'm not very good at this.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.060
Shhh!

22:11.300 --> 22:13.180
I can't do this.

22:13.220 --> 22:17.020
I'm too nervous.
I can't relax.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.580
I'm very embarrassed.

22:27.620 --> 22:30.460
Oh, no, don't be embarrassed.

22:30.500 --> 22:34.300
Just relax, darling.

22:34.340 --> 22:37.180
This is The Big Easy.

22:37.220 --> 22:41.020
Folks have a certain
way of doing things down here.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.940
I've noticed.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.540
Oh, stop that!
Stop what?

22:52.580 --> 22:54.180
That.

22:54.260 --> 22:56.060
What?
That.

22:56.100 --> 22:59.180
What, that, or that?

23:58.780 --> 24:00.620
Yours or mine?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.620
Mine.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.540
Shit.

24:14.940 --> 24:17.220
McSwain, this better be good!

24:19.460 --> 24:23.740
What, slow down a minute. All
right, I'll be right there.

24:23.780 --> 24:25.180
Shit!

24:25.220 --> 24:26.900
What is it?

24:28.340 --> 24:32.180
A triple murder in Storyville.

24:32.260 --> 24:37.980
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
It's okay.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.780
I never did have
much luck with sex anyway.

24:42.980 --> 24:45.180
Your luck is about to change.

24:50.540 --> 24:52.380
Oh boy, ooo-la-la!

24:55.340 --> 25:00.020
How long does a murder take?
A couple of hours at least.

25:01.980 --> 25:02.900
Come back.

25:06.780 --> 25:10.580
You sure?
I'm sure.

25:14.140 --> 25:17.060
We'll talk about
the Angelo case.

25:17.140 --> 25:22.100
Sure!
Oh!

25:35.580 --> 25:39.380
Hey, Hollywood, why don't
you call your mother on the phone.

25:39.420 --> 25:41.300
She hadn't heard
from you in over a week.

25:41.340 --> 25:44.140
Hey, when the hell you going
to make an honest woman of her?

25:45.100 --> 25:47.060
She ain't going to
marry me until I retire.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.980
Yeah, that'll be the day.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.820
What, we got a carnival
going on here or what?

25:52.860 --> 25:54.740
Hey, what the hell's going on?

25:56.660 --> 25:58.500
There's a couple
of kids spreading a rumor

25:58.580 --> 26:01.380
that the killers were
in an unmarked police car.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.300
Great, that's all we need.

26:06.260 --> 26:09.060
Don't be looking at us
'cause you all did it!

26:14.900 --> 26:17.700
All right to roll him over,
lieutenant?

26:17.780 --> 26:19.620
Yeah, roll away.

26:22.580 --> 26:25.380
Whooo!
Jamaal Washington, huh?

26:29.300 --> 26:32.100
Hey, Jack, everything
under control out there?

26:32.180 --> 26:34.980
Oh yeah, the riot's
kind of turned into a party.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.860
Oh man, I love this town.

26:39.860 --> 26:43.620
You remember Miss Anne Osborne.
It's very nice to see you again.

26:43.700 --> 26:48.420
Yeah, you too.
The D.A.'s office is interested

26:48.500 --> 26:51.300
since there's an allegation
of police officer involvement.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.220
You believe every
rumor you hear?

26:53.300 --> 26:55.660
Do you have any evidence
one way or the other?

26:55.740 --> 26:58.540
Right now we got two
unknown white male suspects,

26:58.620 --> 27:02.380
not officers, suspects.
And one unsubstantiated rumor.

27:04.740 --> 27:07.580
Anything on the victims yet?
Yeah.

27:11.460 --> 27:15.260
You don't want to see this guy.
He kind of lost his face.

27:17.220 --> 27:21.020
We have to wait for
a fingerprint I.D. on him.

27:21.060 --> 27:22.940
The third victim I
think is a Nobliet brother,

27:22.980 --> 27:25.820
also narcotics and
runner for Daddy Mention.

27:25.860 --> 27:26.780
Who's Daddy Mention?

27:26.820 --> 27:28.700
He handles the black side
of narcotics.

27:28.740 --> 27:32.540
Vinnie "The Cannon", you met him the
other day, he's got the white action.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.380
Anne.

27:36.420 --> 27:39.260
Why don't you believe
the killers were cops?

27:39.300 --> 27:41.420
If they were cops,
they would have stayed here.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.060
When we arrived we would
have found plants: guns, knives,

27:44.100 --> 27:45.980
all kinds of evidence
that they resisted arrest.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.900
Something every cop
knows how to do.

27:47.940 --> 27:49.820
Doesn't surprise me.

27:49.860 --> 27:52.620
You probably know how to
bribe a jury too, don't you?

27:52.700 --> 27:55.500
Even though you
probably never have, huh?

27:55.580 --> 27:57.740
Hey, Remy, look what I got.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.260
It feels like about a kilo.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.180
That's great work,
Dodge, really great work.

28:03.260 --> 28:05.100
Hey!

28:05.180 --> 28:07.980
Why don't we pass it around
and all put our fingerprints on it?

28:08.060 --> 28:12.780
What's this?
Heroin, Mexican brown.

28:12.860 --> 28:14.700
Somebody's been
using shotguns here, so...

28:15.740 --> 28:18.540
I figure Tandino.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.420
Carmine Tandino, hit man for
Vinnie "The Cannon."

28:21.500 --> 28:24.300
Shotguns are his signature.

28:24.380 --> 28:26.220
Resulting in spaghetti sauce.

28:30.140 --> 28:32.940
Captain, you want to take over here.

28:33.020 --> 28:35.820
I think I should take Miss Osborne home.
Oh, thank you very much.

28:41.660 --> 28:42.540
Watch your step.

28:46.460 --> 28:49.260
Don't they make a lovely couple.

28:51.260 --> 28:55.020
Hey, we'll go to my apartment.
It's closer, all right?

28:55.100 --> 28:56.940
Huh?

28:57.020 --> 28:58.860
After a while you
get used to stuff like that.

28:58.940 --> 29:01.740
You get hardened.

29:01.820 --> 29:04.620
Everybody gets sick the first time.
Don't be embarrassed.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.540
I'll be fine.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.460
Let me know if you're going
to throw up, I'll pull over.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.380
I'm not going to throw up.

29:13.340 --> 29:17.100
You think Carmine Tandino killed
those men tonight, right?

29:17.180 --> 29:20.660
Even with your head in the toilet
you still want to talk business?

29:20.700 --> 29:23.900
Yeah, I think Carmine Tandino
killed those boys tonight.

29:23.980 --> 29:26.340
Therefore, they must
have murdered Freddy Angelo.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.340
I'd say you're right again.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.940
What does that do to your
theory that the Angelo murder

29:31.020 --> 29:32.940
was a message for Vinnie
"The Cannon" to retire?

29:33.020 --> 29:35.900
Now we know who sent it,
Daddy Mention.

29:35.980 --> 29:39.700
Now we're dealing with something more than
one wise guy killing another wise guy.

29:39.740 --> 29:41.500
Well, we sure are.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.540
What's that supposed to mean, huh?

29:43.580 --> 29:47.580
Is Carmine Tandino the only person in the
world who uses a shotgun to kill people?

29:47.660 --> 29:50.460
No, but he's one of the few
who turns a profit at it.

29:50.540 --> 29:53.940
You don't think the cops
had anything to do with this?

29:53.980 --> 29:56.940
Cops don't do that sort of thing.
Not even the rad cops.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.100
You're always accusing
the cops of everything.

29:59.180 --> 30:02.940
Okay, then how do you explain...
Hey, hey, hey,

30:03.020 --> 30:04.860
How do you feel now, huh?

30:06.860 --> 30:08.700
Does this stuff ever get to you?

30:08.780 --> 30:12.540
Who me?
Bullets bounce off me.

30:12.620 --> 30:18.300
You are never afraid?
All the time.

30:28.180 --> 30:29.980
Look out for the gator, baby.

31:24.540 --> 31:26.420
Ahhhh!

31:26.460 --> 31:28.700
Oh shit, who are you?

31:28.780 --> 31:31.500
I'm Bobbie, Remy's brother.
You scared the hell out of me!

31:31.580 --> 31:34.820
Where did you come from?
I spent the night here on the couch.

31:34.900 --> 31:39.900
Oh my god, excuse me.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

31:48.180 --> 31:50.980
Hey, I just went down
to get us some breakfast.

31:51.060 --> 31:55.780
I'm sorry, I'm really late for a meeting.
I have to get to work.

31:55.860 --> 31:58.660
Hey, I'll drive you down there.
It's okay, I'll take a cab.

31:58.740 --> 32:01.540
Did you meet my brother?
Kind of.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.460
Hey, sugar, is something wrong?

32:13.140 --> 32:17.860
What's for breakfast?
Your ass!

32:24.660 --> 32:27.460
Jesus Christ, Remy,
you scared the shit out of me!

32:27.540 --> 32:31.300
Don't just walk into an interrogation
room without knocking, man!

32:31.380 --> 32:33.220
Where are the Storyville witnesses?

32:36.180 --> 32:39.900
Hi. I heard you dudes saw
something last night in Storyville

32:39.940 --> 32:42.300
around the time those
three guys got stovepiped.

32:42.380 --> 32:44.700
They said you saw
an unmarked police car.

32:44.740 --> 32:48.100
What are you talking about ?
We was home watching TV.

32:48.180 --> 32:50.460
We didn't see nothing.

32:50.500 --> 32:53.340
Andre, take their statements,
then let them go home.

32:53.380 --> 32:56.220
You be nice to Andre.
That's "we didn't see nothing."

32:56.260 --> 32:59.620
"We was home watching TV."
Is that right, gents?

33:05.220 --> 33:07.300
Get me out of here!
I hate this job!

33:07.380 --> 33:11.140
Property's a dirty job, Dewey.
You're next in line.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.020
Remy, remember the guy
who lost his face last night?

33:14.100 --> 33:15.940
Look what the morgue
guys found in his pocket.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.860
Ah, Freddy Angelo's drivers license.

33:17.940 --> 33:21.700
Beautiful, I knew those guys
killed Freddy. All right.

33:21.780 --> 33:23.620
And what time did he leave?

33:23.700 --> 33:25.540
You're sure?

33:26.580 --> 33:29.380
Bop-bop-a-do-bop-bop.

33:29.460 --> 33:31.300
Carmine Tandino
has an airtight alibi.

33:31.380 --> 33:34.020
He was at Moscos with his wife
and half his family until four a.m.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.500
I've got 12 witnesses
who corroborate his story.

33:36.580 --> 33:39.980
You know who owns Moscos?
Carmine Tandino's nephew.

33:40.060 --> 33:43.540
It's a very popular spot for alibis.
I'm going to talk to Carmine myself.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.460
Remy, I got Anne Osborne on line.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.020
Do you want me to
tell her you're not here?

33:48.060 --> 33:50.260
No, I'll take it myself.

33:50.300 --> 33:53.140
I can tell her you're not here.
No, really, I'll take it.

33:56.060 --> 33:57.940
Miss Osborne,
I haven't got the forensics

33:57.980 --> 34:02.740
or the ballistics report back yet, so...
I didn't call about that.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.900
Look, Remy, I'm very
sorry about this morning,

34:07.980 --> 34:09.780
about the way
I just ran out like that.

34:10.860 --> 34:13.980
Me too.
I'm sort of confused.

34:14.060 --> 34:16.860
Oh no, don't be confused, no.

34:18.860 --> 34:20.699
Things like last
night don't happen to me.

34:20.780 --> 34:22.620
Me either.

34:22.699 --> 34:26.460
Oh, please.
No, I mean it, I really do.

34:26.540 --> 34:29.340
I know too much about
your reputation to believe you.

34:31.340 --> 34:32.219
God!

34:35.100 --> 34:36.980
You want to get out
of my office, huh?

34:44.699 --> 34:46.580
Anne Osborne.

34:46.620 --> 34:49.460
Look, I'm going to take
you to lunch.

34:49.500 --> 34:53.620
You look into my eyes and tell me
whether you believe me or not.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.699
No, I can't.

34:55.739 --> 35:00.140
Oh, great, then I'm going to make us a
reservation for Antoine's for one o'clock.

35:04.860 --> 35:07.700
What did she want?
Who, Anne?

35:07.740 --> 35:11.540
"Anne" he calls her. She's got
everybody around here scared shitless,

35:11.580 --> 35:14.420
and he calls her
"Anne" for Christ's sakes!

35:14.460 --> 35:16.340
I think that woman
is using the Angelo murder

35:16.380 --> 35:18.260
as an excuse to come
sniffing around our widows...

35:18.300 --> 35:20.180
Shhh!

35:20.220 --> 35:24.020
Widows and orphans fund.
Why don't you relax, son.

35:24.060 --> 35:25.940
Remy's got the lady
wrapped around his finger.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.860
Which reminds me,
what's the beef?

35:27.900 --> 35:30.740
I got a call from the
Sho-bar on Bourbon Street.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.580
There's a new owner in there.

35:32.660 --> 35:35.060
He's having some trouble,
and he wants to talk to you.

35:35.100 --> 35:39.300
I got laryngitis.
He's got this thing about rank.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.220
He don't talk to
no sergeant or flat foot.

35:43.220 --> 35:45.060
Hey, hey,
don't you look at me, Lou.

35:45.140 --> 35:46.980
I got to go
talk to Carmine Tandino.

35:47.060 --> 35:48.900
Oh, come on,
for the widows and orphans.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.740
It will take you five minutes.
It's on your way.

35:52.820 --> 35:55.620
All right, dude, but you
owe me one, huh? Oh!

35:55.700 --> 35:59.460
Watch out, loose ball.
Ohhh!

35:59.540 --> 36:01.380
Oh, you!
That's 200 bucks.

36:24.500 --> 36:28.260
I'm looking for George Joel.
You got him.

36:28.340 --> 36:30.140
I think your mother
is calling you down there.

36:30.180 --> 36:32.060
I heard you wanted
to talk to somebody.

36:32.100 --> 36:36.860
I wanted to see the captain.
Hey, wait a minute, please.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.780
Come back!
I didn't mean to offend you.

36:38.820 --> 36:40.700
I got a different cop in here
every night shaking me down.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.620
I can't stay in business
like that.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.540
You got cops in here
bothering you?

36:44.580 --> 36:46.460
Why don't you just send
them to me?

36:46.500 --> 36:49.340
Don't get me wrong,
I'll pay, one guy, once a month,

36:49.380 --> 36:52.220
not have cops jumping all over me.

36:52.260 --> 36:55.100
Settle down, all right,
I'll take care of it.

36:55.140 --> 36:57.020
I'll give you a number
you can call anytime, okay.

36:57.060 --> 36:59.900
I knew you were
the right guy to talk to.

37:00.900 --> 37:04.700
What's this?
It's my way of saying thanks.

37:07.620 --> 37:11.420
You wearing a wire?
Help, help!

37:11.460 --> 37:17.180
Hold it, freeze!
Get down!

37:19.140 --> 37:20.060
Internal Affairs, hold it!

37:26.820 --> 37:28.620
What's he chewing?
Spit it out!

37:29.980 --> 37:33.420
Chew all you want, asshole.
We've got everything on video tape.

37:38.300 --> 37:41.100
Miss Osborne,
a telephone call.

37:44.060 --> 37:47.820
Jesus, can't I leave
the office for an hour?

37:49.820 --> 37:50.700
What?

37:54.620 --> 37:56.460
I'm sorry, what?

38:00.620 --> 38:03.180
Step up.
Hold it, hold it.

38:03.260 --> 38:06.060
I got to talk with this man.
Cut him loose here.

38:06.140 --> 38:07.980
What's the special treatment?

38:08.060 --> 38:10.860
Come on, man!
Yeah, he's a cop.

38:12.860 --> 38:16.620
What the hell happened?
They set a trap, and I got caught.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.540
The thing that Dodge
was talking about?

38:18.620 --> 38:22.380
That was supposed to be me.
I can handle it.

38:26.860 --> 38:28.820
I got Lamar Parmentel to defend you.

38:28.860 --> 38:30.340
Lamar?

38:30.420 --> 38:33.820
I know, he's beat your brains a thousand
times, but he knows what he's doing.

38:33.900 --> 38:37.540
The guys have agreed the widows and
orphans fund is paying his fees.

38:37.620 --> 38:39.380
You want to keep
your voice down, Jack, man.

38:39.420 --> 38:40.980
Thanks.

38:44.540 --> 38:48.300
Make room and be quiet.
Remy.

38:52.220 --> 38:55.980
We take care of our
own, remember that.

38:57.980 --> 38:59.820
I'm going to take care of it.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.700
I'll give you a number
you can call anytime.

39:02.780 --> 39:04.620
We got the bribery
conviction locked up.

39:04.700 --> 39:06.540
I don't know, it skirts
the edge of entrapment.

39:06.620 --> 39:08.460
If we get the wrong judge,
he'll throw the case out.

39:08.540 --> 39:11.340
Maybe he'll want to make a deal.

39:11.420 --> 39:14.220
I don't think we
should offer a deal now.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.140
We should get a conviction,
then we can offer a deal.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.060
Anne, I want you
to ask for very high bail.

39:18.140 --> 39:20.940
Let him sweat a little.
Help, help!

39:41.100 --> 39:42.940
All rise.

39:44.940 --> 39:47.740
These are the custodies?
Be seated.

39:47.820 --> 39:53.500
Okay, what have we got?
Tibido.

39:53.580 --> 39:57.340
There are two Tibidos, your honor.
Unrelated cases.

39:57.420 --> 40:00.220
All right, sit down,
we'll get back to both of you.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.140
You! you look familiar.

40:04.140 --> 40:07.900
Well, I'm certainly sorry
to see you before me, lieutenant.

40:07.980 --> 40:10.780
Extortion, bribery.
Do you have counsel?

40:10.860 --> 40:15.580
I'm his counsel, your honor.
We waive rights and plead not guilty.

40:15.660 --> 40:20.380
We petition the court for the earliest
possible date for a preliminary hearing.

40:20.460 --> 40:24.180
Now, the 22nd is
the earliest date I've got.

40:24.220 --> 40:27.060
Your honor, everyday my
client is suspended from the force

40:27.100 --> 40:28.980
does great damage to his reputation,

40:29.020 --> 40:33.420
As well as to the on-going
investigations he's conducting.

40:33.500 --> 40:33.780
All right.

40:33.820 --> 40:36.660
We can get you in day after
tomorrow before Judge Garrison,

40:36.700 --> 40:40.500
If that's all right with the state?
We're ready, your honor.

40:40.540 --> 40:43.380
Your honor, giving
due weight to the seriousness

40:43.420 --> 40:46.260
of the charges against
a public official,

40:46.300 --> 40:49.140
the state asks for bail
in the amount of $50,000.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.020
Your honor, the defendant
has been a police officer

40:52.060 --> 40:54.900
for 11 years and has very
strong ties to the community.

40:54.940 --> 40:57.780
Bail is set at $500.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.460
All right, Tibido, Andrew.

41:06.460 --> 41:08.340
That girl is after your ass.

41:08.380 --> 41:10.260
Why don't you let me try
to make a deal.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.140
What kind of a deal?

41:13.180 --> 41:15.060
Plead you guilty to unlawful
acceptance of a gratuity.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.660
Is that a misdemeanor?

41:17.740 --> 41:19.700
A felony, you'll get
maybe three months jail time.

41:19.740 --> 41:22.020
One felony conviction
and I'm off the job.

41:22.100 --> 41:24.140
What kind of a life is that?

41:24.220 --> 41:26.380
I'm a cop,
it's all I know how to do.

41:26.460 --> 41:28.420
Remy, Remy,
they've got a video tape.

41:28.500 --> 41:32.260
Did you ever see
a jury watch a video tape?

41:32.340 --> 41:34.180
It's like watching
Mike Wallace on "60 minutes."

41:34.260 --> 41:38.020
Lamar, I can't go to jail.

41:48.660 --> 41:50.500
Can I help you?

41:50.580 --> 41:54.340
Yeah, I called about...
a nickel magnet.

41:54.420 --> 41:56.260
Yeah, I got it right here.

41:56.340 --> 41:58.180
You're not wearing
a quartz watch, are you?

41:58.260 --> 42:01.060
What?
It's a powerful magnet.

42:01.140 --> 42:02.980
If you're wearing a
quartz watch it will ruin it.

42:03.060 --> 42:05.860
I ain't got no time for no watch.
Good, 183.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.780
Yeah, I know.

42:47.140 --> 42:50.940
Hey, brother.
Hey, what's the matter?

42:50.980 --> 42:53.820
Don't you recognize
your own brother, brother?

42:53.860 --> 42:55.740
Jesus, Remy!

42:56.740 --> 42:59.580
You know Mardi Gras
ain't till February.

42:59.620 --> 43:03.420
What are you doing in that get up?
Oh, a little undercover work.

43:03.460 --> 43:06.300
I thought you were suspended.

43:06.340 --> 43:10.140
Who told you that?
Mama.

43:10.180 --> 43:12.940
She said you were framed.

43:13.020 --> 43:15.820
Look, this is hard as hell
for me to explain to you.

43:15.900 --> 43:18.700
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

43:18.780 --> 43:20.620
Look, I want to be honest
with you.

43:20.700 --> 43:22.940
In this particular case,

43:25.500 --> 43:29.260
It was a setup.
But, I've been on the take

43:29.340 --> 43:35.020
in little-bitty ways since practically
the first day on the job.

43:36.060 --> 43:38.860
I know that.
Oh, yeah?

43:38.940 --> 43:43.660
Who told you?
What do you think, I'm stupid?

43:43.740 --> 43:46.540
Nobody had to tell me.

43:46.620 --> 43:49.420
I know you give mama
the money for my tuition.

43:49.500 --> 43:52.300
It sure don't
come out of your salary.

43:55.260 --> 43:58.060
I'm just glad I can
finally thank you.

43:59.100 --> 44:01.900
I didn't want you
to know about that.

44:04.860 --> 44:09.580
I remember once,
I must have been about six or seven,

44:09.660 --> 44:13.340
I was looking in daddy's
pocket for a candy bar,

44:13.420 --> 44:17.180
and I found seven to eight
$10 dollar bills.

44:17.260 --> 44:20.060
You knew about daddy?

44:20.140 --> 44:21.980
Yeah, I knew about
daddy and all the relatives.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.860
I just...
I figured it was understood.

44:24.940 --> 44:28.700
I didn't understand it.
What?

44:28.780 --> 44:30.460
I didn't have any
idea daddy was on the take

44:30.540 --> 44:33.140
until I was on the job myself.
Are you serious?

44:33.180 --> 44:36.220
You were eight years old when daddy died.
I should have asked you.

44:36.300 --> 44:39.620
It's not too late.
Want to ask me anything else?

44:39.700 --> 44:42.900
Sex?
Drugs?

44:49.900 --> 44:52.700
Have you been having sex?

44:57.580 --> 45:00.380
Don't you want to introduce
your mama to your lawyer, son?

45:00.460 --> 45:02.300
Mama, this is Lamar Parmentel.

45:02.380 --> 45:05.180
Ah, the renowned
queen of the McSwain Clan.

45:05.260 --> 45:08.020
How delightful to finally
meet you in the flesh.

45:08.060 --> 45:08.980
I know all about you, Lamar.

45:09.020 --> 45:11.860
You're the man that
got the governor acquitted.

45:11.900 --> 45:13.780
I know you're going to to
do a fine job defending my Remy.

45:13.820 --> 45:15.700
Yeah, mama, yeah.

45:15.740 --> 45:19.540
Of course, you know about his outstanding
record and the citations they gave him?

45:19.580 --> 45:21.460
Did he ever tell you
about saving the drowning boy?

45:21.500 --> 45:25.300
The baby was in the water.
Hey, where you at?

45:26.300 --> 45:30.100
Who is that?
That's the prosecuting attorney, mama.

45:30.140 --> 45:32.980
Yeah, ain't she cute?
Oh, yeah.

45:33.020 --> 45:34.900
Oye, oye, oye,
criminal district court,

45:34.940 --> 45:37.780
section 8, city of New Orleans,
is now in session.

45:37.820 --> 45:40.660
The Honorable Jim Garrison presiding.
What occurred next?

45:40.700 --> 45:43.540
I saw George Joel hand
the defendant the white envelope.

45:43.580 --> 45:45.460
I saw it very clearly.

45:45.500 --> 45:49.300
And what did the defendant do?
He accepted the envelope.

45:51.260 --> 45:53.140
And from the balcony
you weren't able

45:53.180 --> 45:56.020
to hear the conversation
between this George Joel

45:56.060 --> 45:57.580
and the defendant,
isn't that the case?

45:57.660 --> 45:58.740
Yes, sir.

45:58.820 --> 46:01.780
You testified there were eight
$50 bills in the envelope?

46:01.820 --> 46:05.540
That's correct.
Can you produce this money in court?

46:05.620 --> 46:10.340
Sir, the defendant dropped the money
in the center of the crowded bar.

46:10.420 --> 46:12.260
It was clear the people
in the bar took it,

46:12.340 --> 46:14.180
but we just couldn't search
everybody that was there.

46:14.260 --> 46:15.140
Thank you.

46:20.980 --> 46:22.820
Mr. Joel,
did the defendant promise

46:22.900 --> 46:25.420
that these uniformed officers
would stop harassing you?

46:25.500 --> 46:27.460
Yeah, if I'd pay him,
he would.

46:27.540 --> 46:30.500
What would happen if you did
not make this payment?

46:30.580 --> 46:32.420
If I don't pay,
the police close me down.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.340
Oh!

46:36.340 --> 46:38.180
Have you ever been arrested?

46:38.260 --> 46:41.060
The prosecution stipulates the witness
is currently under indictment.

46:41.140 --> 46:44.900
I'm sure I don't have to remind
the court that clergymen

46:44.980 --> 46:47.780
and bankers are seldom
witnesses at criminal trials.

46:48.820 --> 46:52.580
Is it not true that you would say
anything the prosecution wanted

46:52.660 --> 46:54.500
to avoid being sent to prison?

46:54.580 --> 46:56.420
Yeah.
Objection!

46:56.500 --> 46:58.340
I mean no.
Sustained.

47:03.140 --> 47:05.980
Lieutenant, you said you went
to the tavern to see an informer?

47:06.020 --> 47:06.940
Yes, ma'am.

47:06.980 --> 47:10.780
Now if you were engaged in
your duties as a police officer,

47:10.820 --> 47:13.660
why did you run away from
the Internal Affairs officer?

47:13.700 --> 47:15.580
He did not identify
himself as a police officer.

47:15.620 --> 47:17.500
I thought he was a mugger.

47:19.460 --> 47:22.620
Were you armed?
Yes, ma'am.

47:22.700 --> 47:24.180
And you ran away from a mugger?

47:24.260 --> 47:27.460
I was calling for assistance,
which is proper police procedure.

47:27.540 --> 47:28.980
Was it also proper police procedure

47:29.060 --> 47:32.860
to chew and swallow the envelope
that Mr. Joel gave to you?

47:32.900 --> 47:33.820
What envelope?

47:33.860 --> 47:36.700
Lieutenant, earlier today
officer Crinky swore under oath

47:36.740 --> 47:39.580
that he saw you accept
an envelope from Mr. Joel.

47:39.620 --> 47:41.500
Were you here for that testimony?

47:41.540 --> 47:42.460
Yes, ma'am.

47:42.500 --> 47:46.300
Are you calling your fellow
officer a liar, lieutenant?

47:46.340 --> 47:49.180
No, I just don't know what
envelope you're talking about.

47:49.220 --> 47:53.820
The envelope Mr. Joel gave
you containing eight $50 bills.

47:53.860 --> 47:55.860
Objection, your honor.
Counsel is drawing conclusions.

47:55.940 --> 47:57.820
Sustained.

47:57.860 --> 48:01.660
The $50 bills you threw in the air,
the envelope you ate!

48:01.700 --> 48:03.580
Objection!
Sustained.

48:06.500 --> 48:10.300
I have no further questions.
The witness may step down.

48:18.020 --> 48:20.860
Your honor, tomorrow the prosecution
will present a video tape

48:20.900 --> 48:23.260
that will not only corroborate
every state's witness,

48:23.300 --> 48:26.620
but will refute every statement
the defendant has made.

48:26.660 --> 48:29.500
And show that in addition
to the crime charged,

48:29.540 --> 48:31.340
the defendant has per jured
himself before this court.

48:32.940 --> 48:36.060
This court is adjourned until
10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

49:08.860 --> 49:10.700
It's 3:00 in the morning.

49:10.780 --> 49:12.620
Yes, but this is McCabe,
sorry to bother you.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.500
But somebody just blew
up Carmine Tandino's warehouse,

49:15.580 --> 49:17.420
With him in it.
No kidding!

49:17.500 --> 49:20.300
There's another body too,
nobody knows him.

49:20.380 --> 49:22.220
Maybe you can make him.
I'll be right down.

49:22.300 --> 49:24.140
I don't think
you better come down here.

49:24.220 --> 49:27.020
Deputy Soup is talking
to the TV guys.

49:27.100 --> 49:30.860
Film at 11:00, huh?
Meet us at the morgue in an hour.

49:30.940 --> 49:32.780
Hey, it's a free country,
isn't it?

49:32.860 --> 49:34.700
I'll meet you at
the scene in 15 minutes.

49:42.460 --> 49:44.300
Anne Osborne.

49:44.380 --> 49:47.180
Carmine Tandino was
just killed at his warehouse

49:47.260 --> 49:51.980
down on the Third Street wharf. I
thought you would want to know.

49:54.940 --> 50:08.220
Hey, Remy.
Pssst, come here, come here.

50:08.300 --> 50:10.140
Oh, Remy, I told you not to come.

50:10.220 --> 50:13.980
I'm not here. Where are the bods?
This way.

50:14.060 --> 50:16.860
It looks like the killer
set a fire to destroy the bodies.

50:16.940 --> 50:21.020
The fire explodes a drum of paint thinner,
and the explosion blows out the fire.

50:22.260 --> 50:24.540
How did you identify Tandino?

50:24.620 --> 50:27.420
Oh, yeah,
he had a glass eye, way to go!

50:27.500 --> 50:30.300
Ain't that a beautiful shooter.

50:30.380 --> 50:33.180
This is the guy we can't make.

50:33.260 --> 50:35.100
He must have been hiding
here when they killed Tandino.

50:35.180 --> 50:37.020
Oh god!

50:39.980 --> 50:42.780
Hey, I know him,
that's Tandino's older brother.

50:42.860 --> 50:46.620
I didn't know he had a brother.
Yeah, the poor guy's retarded.

50:46.700 --> 50:49.500
The family kept him at home.

50:49.580 --> 50:51.420
He did a little work
sweeping up the warehouse.

50:51.500 --> 50:55.220
Oh man, now they're killing retards.
Then why ain't you dead?

50:56.220 --> 51:00.980
This is where they work up--
watch your step!

51:01.020 --> 51:02.820
...the Mardi Gras stuff
and all that.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.820
Some of these...

51:04.860 --> 51:06.740
Hold it.

51:06.780 --> 51:10.580
You okay?
Who does this remind you of?

51:10.620 --> 51:12.500
That's for the World's Fair.

51:12.540 --> 51:15.380
They got about 10
or 12 pieces of the thing.

51:15.420 --> 51:18.260
Let me show you this one
cause when I was a kid we used...

51:18.300 --> 51:20.180
Wait, hey!

51:21.180 --> 51:26.900
Miss Osborne, are you sure
that you want to see this?

51:27.900 --> 51:30.740
What the hell is this
man doing here?

51:30.780 --> 51:32.660
What the hell is this man
doing here?

51:32.700 --> 51:36.500
Better yet, what are you doing here?

51:36.540 --> 51:39.380
Yeah, what are you doing here?

51:41.340 --> 51:45.140
I got an anonymous call.
Anne.

51:48.060 --> 51:50.820
They ripped the heart
right out of his chest.

51:50.900 --> 51:51.780
Why would they do a
thing like that?

51:51.860 --> 51:53.700
Voodoo.
Daddy Mention.

51:53.780 --> 51:57.540
The heroin dealer?
And voodoo priest.

51:57.620 --> 51:59.460
That's Daddy Mention's thing.

51:59.540 --> 52:01.380
Yeah, the heart of
your enemy makes you strong.

52:01.460 --> 52:07.140
So, what you're saying is that Daddy
Mention killed Carmine Tandino?

52:07.220 --> 52:09.060
Supporting your theory that Tandino

52:09.140 --> 52:10.980
murdered Daddy Mention's
men the other night.

52:11.060 --> 52:12.900
What we got here
is a cute little drug war.

52:12.980 --> 52:17.700
Doesn't satisfy you, Miss Osborne?
Not particularly, no.

52:17.780 --> 52:19.340
I'll see you in
court tomorrow, McSwain.

52:24.500 --> 52:27.300
That's a woman for you,
Jack, never satisfied.

52:33.140 --> 52:36.900
Order in the court.
All remain seated.

52:41.940 --> 52:43.620
What's her problem?

52:43.700 --> 52:47.780
It seems her key piece of evidence
was erased when a powerful magnet

52:47.860 --> 52:50.500
was placed beside it
in the police property room.

52:50.580 --> 52:53.020
Really?
What, the video tape?

52:53.100 --> 52:54.580
Unusable?

52:54.620 --> 52:58.300
New Orleans is a marvelous
environment for coincidence.

53:04.740 --> 53:07.580
Your honor, because
the key piece of evidence

53:07.620 --> 53:10.460
has been suspiciously tampered with,

53:10.500 --> 53:14.300
the state is compelled to drop its
charges against Lieutenant McSwain.

53:14.340 --> 53:19.100
The defendant is ordered
released and bond is vacated.

53:21.060 --> 53:22.940
Court is adjourned.

53:22.980 --> 53:24.860
All right!

53:28.740 --> 53:29.660
Great job!

53:37.380 --> 53:38.300
Lamar, Lamar.

53:42.180 --> 53:44.060
Wonderful!

53:46.420 --> 53:48.460
I told you I'd get him off.

54:15.740 --> 54:18.540
Miss Osborne.
Yes.

54:18.620 --> 54:21.420
Would you come with me, please.
What, where?

54:21.500 --> 54:26.220
I really can't tell you right now.
Is this supposed to be a joke?

54:26.300 --> 54:30.060
No, it's no joke, my friend.
Well, am I under arrest?

54:30.140 --> 54:31.980
What are the charges?

54:32.060 --> 54:35.820
Well, you were jaywalking
over there,

54:35.900 --> 54:38.700
and when you ran across the bridge,
that's trespassing.

54:40.700 --> 54:43.420
And that I'm going
to call resisting arrest.

54:43.500 --> 54:46.300
You don't happen to be a relative
of Remy McSwain's by any chance?

54:46.380 --> 54:50.140
Look, Cher,
listen to your uncle Solse,

54:50.220 --> 54:53.980
put your pretty face in the car.
I thought so.

55:43.900 --> 55:45.780
Whooo!

55:46.780 --> 55:49.620
Do these cajuns know
how to throw a party or what?

55:49.660 --> 55:52.500
Yeah.

55:52.540 --> 55:54.420
Listen all, I want to be
serious with you for a minute.

55:54.460 --> 55:57.300
Most of you all know that
a policeman's life

55:57.340 --> 56:00.180
is made up of short pay,
long hours, mortal danger

56:00.220 --> 56:03.060
and very little thanks
from the public which we serve.

56:03.100 --> 56:04.980
Every once in a while,
we win one.

56:05.020 --> 56:07.860
Every once in a while
justice triumphs!

56:07.900 --> 56:09.780
Remy, come here!

56:09.820 --> 56:14.580
I want you to raise your cup or your
glass, raise your nose if you have to.

56:14.620 --> 56:18.420
I give you the police department
of the city of New Orleans.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.340
And the fire department.
Yeah!

56:20.380 --> 56:25.140
Okay, the fire department too.
Hey, get some of this food over here.

56:25.180 --> 56:27.060
We done burned 10 chickens,
I don't know what all.

56:27.100 --> 56:28.980
Come on, let's party.

56:30.940 --> 56:35.700
Now you're adding kidnapping and
false arrest to your list of crimes?

56:35.740 --> 56:36.660
You're not under arrest.

56:36.700 --> 56:40.420
Did Uncle Solse give you that impression?
Uncle Solse, apologize.

56:40.500 --> 56:42.340
I'm sorry for that little
misunderstanding.

56:42.420 --> 56:44.260
I suppose now you're going to
tell me I'm free to go.

56:44.340 --> 56:46.180
You're free to go any
time you want.

56:46.260 --> 56:48.100
Where is the telephone?

56:48.180 --> 56:50.980
Up on the porch, I'll show you.
I'll get it myself.

56:51.060 --> 56:55.780
Oh, that pretty girl's got a mad on.
Hey, look at this.

56:55.860 --> 57:00.580
Where is she coming from?
She got some nerve!

57:00.660 --> 57:02.500
Hey, Anne, I thought you were
great in court today.

57:02.580 --> 57:05.380
I want to be a lawyer too.
I lost!

57:06.420 --> 57:10.180
What the hell is she doing here?
A pushy broad, I told you.

57:13.140 --> 57:14.980
Hey, look at this.

57:15.060 --> 57:19.380
Yeah, she don't look bad in shorts, no.
When can you be here?

57:19.460 --> 57:21.100
Fine.

57:24.660 --> 57:29.380
You were saying some pretty hard things
about my boy in that courtroom today.

57:29.460 --> 57:32.260
Yes, I did.
He's a good boy.

57:32.340 --> 57:35.140
He could be a lot better,
Mrs. McSwain.

57:35.220 --> 57:38.020
Are you gonna help him with that?

57:40.340 --> 57:43.780
You got your work
cut out for you.

57:43.860 --> 57:47.620
What did he do, drag you out
of the bathtub, or what?

57:47.700 --> 57:52.420
No, I was running.
Running?

58:55.740 --> 58:57.980
Dance with me,
come on dance with me.

58:58.020 --> 58:59.260
No.

58:59.300 --> 59:01.460
I cut a hell of a rug,
you know.

59:01.500 --> 59:02.820
Come on.
Take your hand off me.

59:02.900 --> 59:07.220
Come on, dance with the boy.
Dance with him.

59:31.620 --> 59:33.500
Aren't you gonna look at me?

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:04.460
Are you satisfied?
Are you still mad at me, huh?

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.540
You don't get it,
do you?

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.940
You're a cop, you're supposed
to uphold the law.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.820
But instead you bend it and twist it
and sell it. I saw you take that bribe

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:17.660
and resist arrest and
per jure yourself under oath.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.540
Don't forget I ran
a red light too.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:25.340
You still think it's funny, don't you.
Why don't you face it, Remy,

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.140
you're not one of
the good guys anymore.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.980
Remy, good to see you back.
Hey, dudes.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:23.940
I want you to do me a favor.
Sure, Remy, anything you need.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.020
Take me off
the widows and orphans fund.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.900
Jesus Christ, Remy,
what do you mean?

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.380
I don't mean nothing,
just take me off.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.260
The widows and orphans
will do just fine without me.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.900
Hey, don't even think about it.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.844
Remy, look at this.
What's this?

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:50.645
Retirement papers, you finally did it.
As of December 31,

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.540
you're the ranking officer
of the homicide bureau.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.420
The fight is yours, baby.
I don't believe you.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.340
Your mother didn't
believe it either.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.260
Are you finally
gonna marry the girl?

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.220
New Year's day.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.140
I'd be honored if
you'd be my best man.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.940
You bet I would,
you little huggy bear, you.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:07.260
Bye, daddy.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.860
What's so funny?
Come here.

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.740
Dodge, De Soto, McCabe,
Foster, in my office.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.780
Welcome back, Remy.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.540
Foster has an interesting angle
on the Freddy Angelo murder.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.420
Second division pulled two floaters
out of the canal last night.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:25.220
They turned out to be
mexican deep sea fisherman.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.140
Suffering from an acute
case of lead poisoning.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.020
They worked out of Vera Cruz
with long records of smuggling.

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.940
What's this got
to do with Freddy Angelo?

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.780
It turns out mexican customs had
a wire tap on both of these guys.

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.700
And guess who their last
phone was from?

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.580
Freddy Angelo.
That's right.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.460
We know Freddy Angelo was in Vera Cruz
three days before he was killed.

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.340
Narcotics said that Freddy never dealt
with anything less than 20 or 30 kilos.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.260
That can explain a gang war.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.180
One kilo of heroin
always seemed kind of small time

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.100
for all these people
to get killed over.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.940
But 20 or 30,
that makes a lot more sense.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.780
Where's the rest of it, huh?
Did anybody talk to Daddy Mention?

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.260
What is he gonna tell us?

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.340
"Come on in, fellas,"
"it's in the back under the sink."

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.260
Come on.
Hello in there.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.220
Hey, don't!

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.100
It's not what he says,
it's what you hear, Einstein.

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.740
Daddy Mention's the number one
suspect in a string of murders,

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.780
and you don't even talk to the guy.
We all know it's a gang war.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.660
Daddy Mention is trying
to move in on Vinnie's action.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.580
That sounds neat,
but I don't buy it no more.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:31.420
Why not, it works for me.
Anne Osborne.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.340
What the hell
does she know about it?

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.260
I don't know what she knows about it,
but she knows something,

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.180
which is a lot more than you guys.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.100
You haven't done
shit since I've been gone.

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.020
They're doing our job for us.

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.940
One creep kills another creep,
that's one less to worry about.

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:46.780
Why not let them wipe each other out?
Because we're the police.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.660
We've got guns and we're
supposed to be the good guys.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.820
I'm going to talk
to Daddy Mention myself.

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.700
All those dinners with Osborne and
you still don't know what she knows.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.300
Remy, you're losing your touch.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.980
You should become
a defense lawyer, my dear.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.820
You meet more colorful people.
You're going to love Daddy Mention.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.620
He's a doctor of roots,
fruits and snoots.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.500
You don't have any scruples at all,
do you, Lamar.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.580
Is there anybody that
you wouldn't represent?

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.180
Darling, every man is entitled to
the best defense money can buy.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.860
Oh, there you are.
I thought I lost you.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:45.620
Why does Daddy Mention want to see me?
Actually, it was my idea.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.500
I thought you might be interested
in what he had to say

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.420
about the rash of
killings we've had of late.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.300
I know you've been looking
into one or two of them.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.820
Daddy's expecting us.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.100
Daddy, this is the young
woman I was talking about.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.580
Well, well, well.
Anne Osborne, Daddy Mention.

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.580
How do you do, Mr. Daddy
...Mention.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:27.100
Excuse my left-hand.
Are they all yours?

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.980
21 children and 14 grandchildren.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.860
I got lost in one of those

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.740
bible verses that says,
"be fruitful and multiply."

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.660
I didn't read any further.

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:41.500
You kids run out, Daddy's
gonna talk some business.

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.340
You're a very lovely lady.
Thank you very much.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.260
But let's get down
to business, shall we.

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:51.140
Mr. Parmentel tells me you're looking
into the murder of them Italian boys.

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.980
Carmine Tandino and Freddy Angelo,

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.860
as well as Jamaal Washington
and Michael and Darnel Nobliet.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.780
All of them allegedly
worked for you.

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:00.700
That's what I want to
talk to you about.

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:05.500
The police are putting out this story
that there is a gang war going on.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.380
Do you believe that?
What do you believe?

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.220
My people didn't kill no Freddy
Angelo or what's his name Tandino

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.060
and cut his heart out.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.940
Then who did?
I don't know.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.780
But I know they're killing my people too.
Why didn't you go to the police with this?

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:26.580
Daddy's had some unfortunate
experiences talking with the police.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:30.420
There's a policeman to see you, Daddy.
Give me a minute.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.180
Thanks.
Lamar.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:39.060
I didn't know you
represented this sleazebag.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.940
I only represent sleazebags, my boy.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.860
What the hell are you doing here?

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.780
I came by to talk to "Chubby."

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.660
I don't know that
he wants to talk to you.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.580
I didn't know the
two of you were like that.

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.500
There are a lot of things
about me that you don't know.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:00.180
Stay here!
Out here!

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:04.020
Daddy's been shot!
No, no!

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:53.940
Ahh!

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.500
What's the big secret, Anne?
And don't you bullshit me, now.

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.380
What evidence do you got on
the Freddy Angelo murder, huh?

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:32.260
So you're beginning
to think cops were involved?

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.380
Yeah.
Why?

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.420
That was an unmarked police car.
It's a piece of shit four-door.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.859
Besides, only cops drive like that.
What do you know?

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:44.700
We have an eyewitness who saw
two men in an unmarked police car

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.580
dump Freddy Angelo's body
into the Piazza D'Italia.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.859
Why did they think it
was an unmarked police car?

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:53.100
They saw a blue light and
a radio in the front seat.

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:56.260
Why did you withhold this
information from the police?

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.180
The police are the suspects.

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:16.380
Hey, get back.
Out of the street.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.100
There isn't no gang war...

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.420
Is there?

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.700
So what are you gonna do about it?

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:36.420
I don't know.
The police department is my family.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.380
These people are killers, Remy.

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:45.979
What do you want me to do, go
undercover in my own precinct house?

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.380
No, I have a better idea.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.220
Come on.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.180
Anne, this is my cousin
Frank, Uncle Earnest.

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.620
you remember Uncle Solse,
cousin Pete.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.860
Guys, thanks for helping out.

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.740
Uncle Solse, I want you to check
everybody coming in or out,

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:20.620
no matter who they are.
You got it, Remy.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.500
Remy, what's going on?
Ask her.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.260
Are you the
desk sergeant on duty?

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:33.100
Do I look like the king of Mardi Gras?
Then this is for you.

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.860
What the hell.
Hey, captain.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.740
There's some broad
here with a search warrant.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.460
Do you believe this shit?

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:56.140
Anybody who does not cooperate fully
and cheerfully with this investigation

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.020
will wish his mother
and father never met.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.940
Was your car damaged?
It was in the lot for two days.

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.820
What was the nature
of the damage?

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:09.500
If you told me about this,
we could have sent out invitations.

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.420
Is that car 17?
Right.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.340
What district?
Seven.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.340
Sorry, boys, I've got orders
to pat everybody down.

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.140
Take out your weapons.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.060
This lawyer is leading
Remy around by his nose.

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:21.980
Try his dick.
Higher, Solse.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:28.180
Don't you touch me, you dirty old man.
Everything.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.540
Andre's afraid of the dark.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.300
Dark my ass,
it's a jungle out there.

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.220
If that don't work,
I piss on them.

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.940
There it is, right there. No,
those are junkers over there.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.220
That baby hasn't been out
of here in three months.

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:54.100
Not a bad shot.
Thanks.

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:56.580
I want this car dusted
for fingerprints.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.740
You'll find mine
all over the hood.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.380
Are you gonna come over
and clean up by my house?

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.900
You're gonna pay for this, bitch.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.820
Eat or work?
Work.

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.420
My place or yours?
Yours.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.100
That way I can leave
any time I want.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:43.860
Did you find something? You
look a little strange.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:47.700
No, just fried oysters
at 1:00 o'clock in the morning.

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.540
Why don't we just
call it a night, huh.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:01.060
Who are you calling?
A cab.

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.900
Why don't you just stay here.
I'll sleep on the couch.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:09.060
Thanks any way.
Oh, now. Wait a minute.

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.540
You're gonna be over here
first thing in the morning.

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:20.100
Hey, I won't try
no "cha-cha," I promise.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.940
The bed is yours, huh.

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:26.020
No thank you,
but I'd rather go home.

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.700
Oh, Annie.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.860
Are you gonna be pissed off at me
for the rest of your life?

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.580
Maybe.

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.220
Hey, can I get you anything?

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:43.060
No thanks, I'll be asleep as soon
as my head hits the pillow.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:52.140
If I can't have you...
can I have my gator?

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.060
Freeze!

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.420
What is this,
"let's scare Bobby week?"

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.580
You're gonna give me
a heart attack before I'm 21.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.660
Shhh, Anne is sleeping
in the bedroom, be quiet.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.380
And you're sleeping on the couch?

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:02.380
Yeah, what about it.
Where am I supposed to sleep?

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.740
I thought you college boys
like sleeping on the floor.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.940
Yeah, well, we don't.

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.580
Good morning.
Morning.

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.660
Hey Remy,
is the coffee ready yet?

01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:00.540
We're all out of coffee.
Why don't you go get some coffee.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:03.860
But it's pouring.
Take my raincoat.

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.620
I don't have any money.
Here's some money for you.

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.540
I want you to take a cab
to the farthest place you can find

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.900
and have a nice large breakfast.

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:15.580
I want you to take in a movie and
I want you to give me a phone call.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.500
Annie.

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.460
Oh.

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:54.420
We have to get back to work.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:08.020
Absolutely.
Cha-cha, cha-cha.

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:28.780
What was that?
Get away from the window!

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:31.700
Do you see anything?
Dial "911."

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:35.620
Tell them shots fired at this address,
I'll meet them out on the street.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:43.740
I'm a cop.
Bobby!

01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:50.020
He's dead.
Please.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.340
Oh, my god.
Bobby!

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:58.540
Hold that tight!
Where are they?

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:05.020
Call the hospital and
tell them we're on our way!

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.660
Move over!

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.420
Oh, god.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.540
Jack, they tried to kill my baby.
Is he gonna be all right?

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:41.940
I've got to talk to you, Jack.
What is it?

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:44.340
Nothing, mama,
just police business.

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.220
Come on.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.340
I was going over
the logs last night.

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.420
Some of them have been
tampered with.

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.300
Vehicle logs, patrol logs,
arrest logs.

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:04.620
All different departments.

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.700
What's that tell you?

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:13.140
Only someone in command
has access to the files.

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.940
So that's either me or you.

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:21.020
Was it you?
Who is it, Jack?

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.900
You got a wire on?

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:32.540
No wire. Just you and me.
Family.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:44.260
You've got a friend
in Mexican Customs, don't you?

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:46.180
You got that right.

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:50.100
What happened, once you found out
about Freddy Angelo's heroin deal,

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.340
you decided to rip him off
and go into business for yourself?

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.140
It was a good idea.
We got a lot of scum off the street

01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.060
with very little cost
to the taxpayers.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:59.660
Somebody shot my brother, Jack!

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.540
They thought it was me,
he was wearing my coat.

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:04.500
Jesus, you think I had
something to do with that?

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.420
You're like my own flesh and blood.

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:10.260
I don't know what happened.
Somebody panicked.

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.700
Who panicked?

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:21.340
You've been behind this thing
all the way from the beginning.

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.540
Freddy Angelo and the Mexicans.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.220
Yeah, and Carmine Tandino
and the boys in Storyville.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.500
And Daddy Mention.
Garbage.

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:34.060
Where's the heroin, Jack?

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:38.460
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:50.460
There must be more than
five million dollars worth.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:54.300
It's a very big pie.
And you're entitled to a fair slice.

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:57.180
So why don't you
take it and walk away.

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.980
You taught me a lot
when I first came on the job.

01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:11.580
What was okay,
and what wasn't okay.

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:17.540
Is dealing heroin, okay, Jack?
Is murder okay?

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:25.540
I just wanted to go out a winner.
Thirty years.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.180
Your daddy never
cared anything about that.

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.740
All he wanted to do
was chase the girls.

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.620
And he caught the best one.

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:41.140
I want to spend
rest of my life with her.

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.220
You touch my mother again
I'll kill you!

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.900
You can't talk to me that way.

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.900
He's gonna be all right!

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:05.060
Jack.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:33.340
So Kellom has an alibi
for every one of the killings.

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:35.900
Then somebody is pulling
that trigger for him.

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.260
Don't you have
any idea who it is?

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.940
I've run out of ideas, Annie.

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:02.740
Charity Hospital,
give me intensive care.

01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:05.300
Mrs. McSwain, please.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:14.260
Remy, I still can't believe it.
I can't believe it either.

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:16.580
He admitted it right to my face.

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.460
He was all the time
so good to us, you know.

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:21.420
Take care of Bobby.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:24.340
I'll call you later.
Bye, mama.

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:47.420
There's something
you should know.

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:56.380
I had that magnet
placed in the property room

01:23:56.460 --> 01:24:00.020
next to the video tape.

01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:05.980
A guy owed me a favor.
And you promoted him.

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:09.820
You knew that too, huh.

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:16.340
Before I got promoted,
I used to be a bag man for Kellom.

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:19.260
Just nickel and dime stuff.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:27.220
You figure it's the system.

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:34.100
That it's not going to make a difference
if you take a few hundred here and there.

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:39.700
You figure you
deserve a good life.

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.700
For a decent living
for doing a dirty job.

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:52.100
You tell yourself you
can be just as good a cop.

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.460
I know.

01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:59.620
But you can't.

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:45.500
Wait a minute.

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.940
Maybe we should
look at this another way.

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.900
How did those two Mexican smugglers
end up in the industrial canal?

01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:01.300
Came down from Lake
Pontchartrain, I guess.

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.540
How did they get there?

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:09.540
A fishing boat, probably.
Where's the boat?

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.620
How are we supposed to
know where to find the boat?

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:55.780
Dodge and De Soto
impounded a boat

01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.740
the night that Freddy
Angelo was killed.

01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:00.340
They're the killers,
those two clowns.

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.300
Hey, captain.

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.100
You're crying all over our future.

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:13.580
We don't have any future, boys.
Maybe you don't.

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:17.620
We've got a plane to catch. We've
got to get rid of this shit.

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:22.940
Captain, just put the stuff down
and get out of here.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.140
We're dumping it.

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.100
We don't have to listen
to you any more!

01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.980
I'm not gonna tell you again!

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.180
Oh, shit.

01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.380
Just stay here.

01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.300
Ohhh!

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.140
Oh, Jack.

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.500
Hey, Remy,
where are you at?

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.580
Throw the gun up on the deck.

01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:10.740
Climb up on out of there.

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:20.940
We had a perfectly good situation here
And you had to screw it up on us.

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:25.420
You turned on us,
Remy. I didn't turn on you.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:28.620
What are you talking about?
We're all family, aren't we?

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.660
Can't we work something out?
That's that old Remy.

01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:35.740
What do you say,
what's it gonna be?

01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.300
Move out on the dock.

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:43.940
I've got to hand it to you guys,
the way you handled that situation.

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:49.020
I mean it was genius.
Real genius.

01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.220
What do you take us for?
Assholes.

01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:57.500
You see them?
I can't see a goddamn thing.

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.780
They've got to come up
for air sometime.

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.820
The bitch is over here.
Come on.

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:59.060
What's that?
He's on the other boat.

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:31.580
We got 'em now.
Next stop, Tahiti.

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.820
Andre!

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:24.940
Remy?

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.300
Are you all right?
Uh-huh.

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.820
Jesus Christ, it's gonna blow!

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.460
Run!
