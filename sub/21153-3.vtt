00:01.335 --> 00:04.438
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.471 --> 00:06.574
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.377
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:09.410 --> 00:12.080
but at a terrible cost.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.548
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.582 --> 00:16.059
a secretive group
called the Shepherds

00:16.084 --> 00:19.587
released a gas that
sterilized all of humanity.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.789
And then lab-made
creatures called hybrids

00:21.822 --> 00:24.158
devastated the West coast.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.693
So a massive barrier
was constructed,

00:25.726 --> 00:28.329
to protect the rest
of North America,

00:28.362 --> 00:31.365
but new breeds have
started to appear,

00:31.399 --> 00:33.201
so we reassembled our team.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.070
We battle on many fronts,

00:36.104 --> 00:36.937
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:36.970 --> 00:40.608
while racing to stop the hybrids

00:40.641 --> 00:43.711
and a brutal terrorist with
a plan to end the human race.

00:43.744 --> 00:47.648
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.784
Previously on Zoo...

00:50.818 --> 00:52.853
I want what you want...
To find the person who

00:52.886 --> 00:54.355
bombed my precinct
and your camp.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.523
I ID'd the bomber.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.225
Her name is Abigail Westbrook.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.792
Jackson, she's your sister.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.095
My father's alive,
and he needs you, Jamie.

01:04.197 --> 01:05.433
Nice beard.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.435
If we don't find a way
to stop the hybrids,

01:07.468 --> 01:10.471
the entire world is gonna
wind up like Portland.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.641
We'll let Dr. Kenyatta
handle it.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.109
Jackson sent you this.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.420
What is that?
ABRAHAM: Tissue sample.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.246
The razorbacks have come for it.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.581
(growling) ISAAC: Daddy?

01:20.614 --> 01:22.716
WOMAN: No! (growling)

01:22.750 --> 01:24.252
I'm okay.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.886
Dariela. Hi, Jonah.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.455
Does Abe know you're calling?
No.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.123
But I have some research
you need to see.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.267
I think Abe is onto something.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.792
My name is Leanne Ducovny.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.795
Your child has been
selected to participate

01:34.828 --> 01:35.896
in our pilot program.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.498
Isaac!

01:37.531 --> 01:39.167
ABRAHAM: Isaac!

01:39.200 --> 01:42.236
DISPATCHER: 911.
What's your emergency?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.771
My child's been taken.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.173
DISPATCHER: Ma'am?

01:45.206 --> 01:46.840
DARIELA: Listen to me. My son

01:46.874 --> 01:47.917
and the other
children in Oak Haven

01:47.941 --> 01:49.610
have been abducted by the 813th.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.446
National Guard Regiment
out of Fort Dolostone.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.249
The convoy that took them had
been diverted by the snowstorm,

01:55.283 --> 01:56.650
but we found them. My husband's

01:56.684 --> 01:58.219
following one of
their transports.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.188
DISPATCHER: Calm down.
I'm going to help.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.598
We're getting a lot
of calls about this.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.191
Do you have Internet access?

02:03.224 --> 02:05.226
DARIELA: What are
you talking about?

02:05.259 --> 02:07.161
Go to the Web site
AssembleOurFuture.com.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.895
There you'll be able to read.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.275
Presidential Executive Order
14725, and hopefully you can...

02:11.299 --> 02:13.234
DARIELA: Are you serious?

02:13.267 --> 02:14.778
You're reading from
a script right now?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.704
(beeps)

02:17.938 --> 02:18.906
Abe?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.208
Hey, stop!

02:20.241 --> 02:21.742
Move. Move!

02:27.981 --> 02:30.418
(brakes squealing)

02:31.952 --> 02:33.854
SOLDIER (over radio):
Male approaching.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.390
Back in your vehicle.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.726
Now. My son... My-my son

02:38.759 --> 02:40.228
is in one of those trucks.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.196
Isaac?! Daddy!

02:43.264 --> 02:44.798
Isaac! Daddy!

02:44.832 --> 02:46.267
Isaac! I'm coming for you!

02:46.300 --> 02:47.801
Trucks are covered.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.271
Move 'em out. No, no, no.
Please, please.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.249
You can't do this!
Stay behind the barricade, sir.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.113
I'm not gonna ask again.
(gun chambers cocking)

02:55.509 --> 02:56.786
ABRAHAM: You're
going to shoot me?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.246
For trying to get to my son?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.380
Do not take another step!

02:59.413 --> 03:00.848
Stand down. What are you doing?!

03:00.881 --> 03:02.550
Daddy!

03:02.583 --> 03:05.453
You are soldiers!
Don't you have children?

03:05.486 --> 03:08.656
No, and unless something
changes, I never will.

03:08.689 --> 03:13.227
Now... back... off... sir.

03:13.261 --> 03:16.697
I am going to follow my son.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.965
Daddy! And there is

03:17.998 --> 03:20.301
nothing you can do to stop me.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.503
We have orders to use deadly
force if you don't comply.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.972
COMMANDER (over radio): Let's
get this convoy going, soldiers.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.709
Daddy!

03:30.911 --> 03:32.946
Isaac?

03:41.021 --> 03:45.659
WOMAN (on TV): Wisconsin,
Illinois and Michigan,

03:45.693 --> 03:48.562
where the Federal government
authorized Reiden Global

03:48.596 --> 03:51.265
to quarantine children under 12.

03:51.299 --> 03:54.968
Reiden Global CEO Leanne
Ducovny defended the action,

03:55.002 --> 03:57.538
comparing it to this
country's own history

03:57.571 --> 04:00.508
of a military draft
as a civic duty.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.611
In other news, investigators
have linked a deadly explosion

04:03.644 --> 04:07.981
at an NYPD precinct
to a similar tragedy

04:08.015 --> 04:10.918
at a refugee camp in Portland.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.654
Authorities are searching for this
woman, Abigail Westbrook,

04:13.687 --> 04:16.457
a person of interest
in the investigation.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.692
Who also happens
to be my sister.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.296
Wanted on 23 counts,

04:22.330 --> 04:24.965
from impersonating a federal
agent to using weapons

04:24.998 --> 04:27.000
of mass destruction. Twice.

04:27.034 --> 04:30.338
Any luck tracing that phone
call she made to me? No.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.340
She's very good at
covering her tracks.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.707
Do we know anything else?

04:33.741 --> 04:35.643
Like how she's connected
to the hybrids?

04:35.676 --> 04:38.312
You can ask Abigail
yourself when we arrest her.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.381
Who's Abigail?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.018
The person who
attacked our camp.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.954
Logan ID'd her.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.423
Her name's Abigail Westbrook.
Huh.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.526
He didn't get much else.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.994
Any idea where she is?

04:54.027 --> 04:55.529
'Cause I need to hit something.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.998
Preferably one
Abigail Westbrook.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.568
I plastered her
photo at airports,

05:00.601 --> 05:03.036
train stations and the border.
Chopper's on standby.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.406
You guys know this area better

05:05.439 --> 05:06.883
than anybody, so,
the moment that we do get

05:06.907 --> 05:08.051
a hit on her,
I'm hoping that you'll come with...

05:08.075 --> 05:11.078
(distorted conversation)

05:11.111 --> 05:12.580
TESSA (faintly):
Dylan, you okay?

05:12.613 --> 05:14.715
Dylan, you okay?

05:14.748 --> 05:18.452
Yeah. Just tired.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.787
Yeah.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.359
Yeah, I know.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.806
I should just tell her the
truth, but how can I explain it

05:29.830 --> 05:32.866
to her if I can't make
sense of it myself?

05:41.174 --> 05:47.147
Dad, I know people can't
have kids anymore, but...

05:47.180 --> 05:48.982
guess what?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.452
I'm pregnant.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.954
I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.989
I know you've only been awake

05:56.023 --> 05:58.859
for a couple days, but...

05:58.892 --> 06:01.495
I'm bearing child.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.096
Bearing child?

06:04.898 --> 06:07.167
Dad,

06:07.200 --> 06:10.070
I'm having a baby.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.106
You got this.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.480
So...

06:19.513 --> 06:23.050
let me just... recap.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.452
Jackson's gone into hiding,

06:24.485 --> 06:26.119
and you have no
idea where he is?

06:26.153 --> 06:28.422
I haven't seen him in years.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.459
And Logan, that beacon of
truth and justice, is a cop?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.193
Yeah. And Abe's a doctor?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.563
Like, a doctor doctor?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.598
Any soul-rattling news
you'd like to share?

06:40.968 --> 06:44.905
Now's probably
not the best time.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.708
So there's no team,
just us against

06:47.741 --> 06:50.744
a rapidly-growing horde
of vicious hybrids

06:50.778 --> 06:52.946
that are barely being
contained by a barrier?

06:52.980 --> 06:55.449
Oh, and all of
humanity is sterile.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.451
JAMIE: You've been in
a tank for ten years.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.752
A few things have changed.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.789
So it appears.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.824
You wrote a book,

07:03.857 --> 07:06.727
and you're now absurdly rich.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.929
And I'm famous.

07:10.664 --> 07:15.168
So, what,
you grew up in her fancy penthouse?

07:15.202 --> 07:18.506
Till I went to go
live with Grandpa.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.207
Grandpa?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.576
Let me ask you something.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.478
When you were leaving Pangaea,

07:24.512 --> 07:27.581
and I was getting gored
to death by razorbacks,

07:27.615 --> 07:31.719
did Abe perchance
relay a message to you?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.253
To look after Clem.
That's right.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.589
To look after Clem,
which is something

07:35.623 --> 07:38.225
I couldn't have done on account
of me dying to save the world.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.660
You know, that old chestnut.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.094
You, of all people,

07:41.128 --> 07:44.264
should know that Grandpa
is quite literally

07:44.297 --> 07:46.900
the last person on earth
I would want raising her.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.538
Well, Grandpa came to
her 14th birthday party,

07:50.571 --> 07:52.606
and the next day,
I was served with a summons.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.175
He was seeking custody,
and seeing as I'm not

07:55.208 --> 07:57.878
a blood relative,
there wasn't a whole lot I could do.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.514
Well. You know what?

08:00.548 --> 08:03.083
Just put me back in the tank.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.952
(quietly): Back in the tank.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.286
Back in the... back in the...

08:06.319 --> 08:08.188
Back... back... back...

08:08.221 --> 08:09.232
(echoing): Dad? Back in the...

08:09.256 --> 08:11.258
(echoing): Mitch?
(echoing): Back in the...

08:11.291 --> 08:12.693
(echoing): Dad?

08:13.661 --> 08:15.529
Back in the tank.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.730
Back in the tank...

08:21.201 --> 08:22.836
(groaning, vehicle approaching)

08:24.572 --> 08:25.973
(car door closes)
JONAH: Dariela?

08:27.575 --> 08:30.110
Jonah?
They took Isaac, didn't they?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.311
Where's Abraham? Is he here?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.714
What are you doing here?

08:33.746 --> 08:36.216
This is my fault. I thought.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.251
Abraham's research was
a true breakthrough,

08:38.284 --> 08:39.986
and could help Reiden with a...

08:40.020 --> 08:42.556
W-W-Wait, Jonah.
You sent his research to Reiden?

08:42.590 --> 08:45.158
You think that's why
they took the kids?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.861
ABRAHAM: What are
you doing here?

08:49.697 --> 08:52.332
JONAH: Wh... I...

08:52.365 --> 08:53.967
Th-This is not what you think.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.836
What are you doing here, Jonah?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.005
Don't you make me
ask you a third time.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.807
Look, I came here to help you.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.041
Okay? (groaning)

09:01.074 --> 09:02.776
Abe?

09:02.810 --> 09:05.212
DARIELA: Abe!
You have the nerve to come to my home

09:05.245 --> 09:06.947
on this day of all days?!

09:06.980 --> 09:08.949
(groaning) To help?!

09:08.982 --> 09:11.151
What kind of help could I want

09:11.184 --> 09:13.654
from the man who
slept with my wife?!

09:13.687 --> 09:14.922
(groans)

09:15.956 --> 09:17.958
♪

09:28.335 --> 09:32.105
Abraham, stop it!
We had an agreement.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.275
That you would
never see him again.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.178
He's here about Isaac!
Let him go!

09:38.211 --> 09:40.347
(groans, pants)

09:43.817 --> 09:45.185
(panting)

09:45.218 --> 09:46.720
I had no idea

09:46.754 --> 09:49.189
what Reiden would do
with your research...

09:49.222 --> 09:52.292
That they would take children
because of what it contained.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.228
How did Reiden get their
hands on my research?

09:55.262 --> 09:58.131
I thought it would help us, Abe.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.233
So I gave it to him.

10:00.267 --> 10:04.037
I'm so sorry.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.973
And I gave it to Reiden.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.175
(crying): I'm sorry.

10:10.177 --> 10:13.613
This isn't a stroke,
but it is brain-related.

10:15.082 --> 10:18.185
I can talk for now,

10:18.218 --> 10:19.720
but we've got to move quickly,

10:19.753 --> 10:21.655
because the brain works
like a pinball machine.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.224
If one area gets stimulated,
if affects another.

10:24.257 --> 10:28.195
Blue, and those are red, right?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.730
We need to get
you to a hospital.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.932
Can you just answer my
question, please? Red,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.400
and blue, yes? Yes.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.836
I think there's pressure on
the speech center of my brain,

10:35.869 --> 10:37.905
and I've got to find
out what's causing it.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.708
We got to get in there.
What do you mean, "get in there"?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.776
I mean... get in there.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.782
Let's do it. (whirring)

10:48.816 --> 10:50.426
Are you really gonna perform
brain surgery with that?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.085
Are you nuts?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.821
That is exactly what we need.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.925
Why are you here?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.894
To absolve yourself for this?

11:00.928 --> 11:02.996
Let me help you get Isaac back.
How?

11:03.030 --> 11:06.700
Give me his Social Security
number and his date of birth.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.811
My cousin works for Reiden.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.002
She may be able

11:09.036 --> 11:10.704
to track him down, get him out.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.005
We'll send it to your phone.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.208
I'll call you,
soon as I know something.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.813
I feel like I could die.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.349
I deserve to.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.719
Is your arm okay?

11:30.157 --> 11:33.060
There has to be
something we can do.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.762
Maybe you could talk to Reiden.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.030
And say what?

11:37.064 --> 11:38.832
(whispers): I don't know.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.401
If I had something useful
to show them, then...

11:41.434 --> 11:44.204
That new hybrid sample.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.307
The other night, you said it was
the key to solving sterility.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.709
The sample's gone.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.747
Unless...

11:53.781 --> 11:55.348
(door opens)

11:55.382 --> 11:57.384
(phone vibrating)

12:16.203 --> 12:18.005
Hey. Is this about
the sample I sent?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.807
What's going on?

12:19.840 --> 12:20.540
Yes. Can you get another?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.541
No.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.010
Uh, sorry, I can't.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.846
The hybrid was destroyed
in an explosion.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.881
Oh, God.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.282
What's this about?

12:29.316 --> 12:30.559
I don't know if
you've seen the news,

12:30.583 --> 12:32.786
but Reiden has taken children.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.530
Isaac is one of them,
I'm trying to get him back.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.023
I saw that.

12:36.056 --> 12:39.326
I was hoping that Isaac
wasn't one of them.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.795
I'll be there as soon as I can.
No, no, it's too dangerous,

12:41.829 --> 12:43.797
with the Shepherd hunters
still looking for you.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.800
But what you can do is get me
another one of those hybrids.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.969
Its stem cells may
stimulate reproduction.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.805
If I can get another sample,

12:51.839 --> 12:52.982
it may help solve the
sterilization problem.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.483
And Reiden would have
to let my son go.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.209
If this new hybrid

12:56.243 --> 12:58.345
is the key to solving
humanity's sterility problem

12:58.378 --> 13:00.213
and can save Isaac, then, Abe,

13:00.247 --> 13:03.183
I will do whatever it
takes to hunt one down.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.818
Thank you, rafiki.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.187
This new hybrid is not
like the razorbacks.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.588
It is something new.

13:08.621 --> 13:12.292
They seem to communicate
interspecies at 32 kilohertz.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.062
We may be able to track
them using this frequency.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.364
Great. Okay, I'll be in touch.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.600
All right? And Abe, stay strong.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.336
We are gonna get Isaac back.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.616
Abe's son is in trouble.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.251
And he needs our help.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.953
So we need to hunt a hybrid.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.288
Your long-lost baby sister

13:41.321 --> 13:42.289
murdered 200 people
and counting.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.623
We need to be hunting her.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.226
Look, if I could do this
myself, trust me, I would,

13:46.259 --> 13:49.062
but I need your chopper,
and you need my tracking skills,

13:49.096 --> 13:51.498
so first,
we hunt the new hybrid.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.233
I don't care about
your new hybrid.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.502
I care about Jose Mendoza, my T.O.
who died in my arms.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.613
Not only is this to help Abe's kid...
I had to tell his two daughters

13:57.637 --> 13:58.882
that their father wasn't coming home.
this could help solve

13:58.906 --> 14:00.616
humanity's sterility problem,
so if you could just look past...

14:00.640 --> 14:01.942
TESSA: Hey, what's going on?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.512
We get a lead on Abigail?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.280
Change of plans.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.560
Okay. Drill firmly but evenly.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.096
Just until the skull pops.
Then turn it off.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.399
Do not... drill too far.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.001
Until the skull pops. Got it.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.003
"Got it," like this
is no big deal.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.972
Hey.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.341
Come here.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.945
This is gonna be fine.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.346
Okay?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.081
Tell you what.

14:41.114 --> 14:45.285
When it's all over,
since you're an adult now,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.687
we'll go have a beer.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.190
I already had my first
beer when I was 14.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.391
Not a fan.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.394
Max gave you a beer? At 14?

14:54.427 --> 14:56.396
It wasn't Grandpa.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.200
Oh.

15:00.233 --> 15:04.537
You gave a 14-year-old a b...
(monitor beeping)

15:04.571 --> 15:07.207
A b... (beeping increases)

15:07.240 --> 15:09.909
(monitor whining) We
need to do this now.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.686
(chatter over laptop)

15:19.719 --> 15:21.454
REPORTER: Leanne.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.056
REPORTER 2: Leanne Ducovny.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.057
REPORTER: Where are
the children going?

15:24.091 --> 15:26.026
Leanne, over here.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.061
(glass shatters)

15:33.266 --> 15:36.636
Let me help you with that.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.671
Abe.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.046
After you had the affair,

15:46.079 --> 15:48.982
I couldn't look at you.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.985
Every time I tried,

15:52.019 --> 15:54.354
all I saw was betrayal.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.157
So I started to focus on Isaac,

15:57.190 --> 15:59.592
tried to see you
through our boy's eyes.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.229
As a mother.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.264
A good mother.

16:04.297 --> 16:08.635
That got me through.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.104
But now, Isaac is gone.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.740
I don't know how

16:13.773 --> 16:15.508
to look at you anymore.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.976
You're gonna have to try.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.150
Abe.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.651
Abe.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.287
Let me help you.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.360
ABRAHAM: Of course,
I am not without blame.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.796
If I had not left to
help Jackson that summer,

16:36.829 --> 16:39.066
you would not have
turned to Jonah.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.633
I know that much.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.604
But the choices you made,

16:44.637 --> 16:49.542
what that did to us...
and Isaac.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.247
(phone ringing)

17:03.223 --> 17:05.258
Yes?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.727
I understand.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.830
His cousin found Isaac.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.032
They're arranging a transfer.

17:19.839 --> 17:20.839
To the left.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.709
Little bit, to, to the left.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.743
Your other left.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.079
Right there.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.782
What is that?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.758
(man screaming faintly)

17:47.300 --> 17:48.701
Mitch, say something.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.645
MITCH: Whatever that
is, it looks artificial.

17:58.678 --> 17:59.846
Well, then, let's get it out.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.181
No.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.815
It's a live current.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.817
We don't know what kind
of brain damage will occur

18:04.851 --> 18:07.220
if we extract it.

18:07.254 --> 18:07.887
Okay, what do we do?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.422
Land the plane,

18:09.456 --> 18:11.858
and I need you to
get me four items.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.160
Car battery,

18:13.193 --> 18:15.228
some commercial-grade Velcro,

18:15.262 --> 18:17.197
some lollipops and a pig.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.766
Pig, is that, like,
an acronym for something?

18:19.799 --> 18:20.733
Like, a pig.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.834
A pig pig?

18:21.868 --> 18:22.769
Yes, a pig.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.538
Oh, any particular kind?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.874
Any kind you can
get your hands on.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.719
(engine turns off)

18:49.762 --> 18:50.897
Who is this?

18:50.930 --> 18:52.265
JONAH: What's going on?

18:52.299 --> 18:54.701
Says he's Isaac Kenyatta.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.736
I don't care what thing says.
That is not Isaac.

18:56.769 --> 18:57.904
Must be a mix-up.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.406
What the hell does
that even mean?

18:59.439 --> 19:00.883
There must be some
kind of explanation.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.309
Where is Isaac?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.812
DARIELA: Where is my son?

19:13.586 --> 19:16.155
(pig squealing,
growling) (glass shattering)

19:26.699 --> 19:28.701
Don't ask.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.606
MITCH: Structure of a pig's
brain is similar to a human's.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.610
So by connecting it to mine,
we can flash the device.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.812
Make it safe for removal.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.781
So I kind of understand
all this other stuff,

19:41.814 --> 19:43.816
but why the lollipops?

19:43.850 --> 19:45.718
Oh, those are for me. For after.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.321
Let me go get some sedatives.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.357
CLEMENTINE: When I was 14,

19:50.390 --> 19:52.859
Jamie overheard me talking
to a friend on the phone

19:52.892 --> 19:55.762
about having a keg
party in the forest.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.597
She offered to host it instead.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.599
Said she'd rather have
us drink where she could

19:59.632 --> 20:01.000
keep an eye on us.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.403
Jamie did an amazing
job raising me.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.405
And so did Logan.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.307
Logan?

20:07.340 --> 20:08.551
CLEMENTINE: And
Grandpa after that.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.477
(beeping rapidly)

20:10.510 --> 20:12.479
I'm not sure which part
of this story I hate more.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.889
You know, growing up,
I never realized how much

20:13.913 --> 20:15.415
of a pain in the ass you were.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.983
Everyone did the
best they could.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.885
Everyone knew what I preferred,

20:18.918 --> 20:21.488
and they did exactly none of it.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.991
Mom died, and in the same
month, so did you.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.360
I was 12 and alone.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.497
You don't get a say
in how I was raised.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.598
(grunting)

20:36.068 --> 20:38.004
JACKSON: I recalibrated the GPS

20:38.037 --> 20:39.572
to track the
frequency Abe gave me.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.341
I've got an IADG

20:41.374 --> 20:43.443
surveillance satellite here.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.677
What am I looking for?

20:44.711 --> 20:47.046
Thermal imaging.
All right, as far as I can tell,

20:47.079 --> 20:49.549
this hybrid is part rhinoceros,

20:49.582 --> 20:52.018
part Pleistocene woolly mammoth.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.486
As in, part prehistoric?

20:53.520 --> 20:56.523
Hmm, as in "woolly rhino."

20:56.556 --> 20:57.866
It's like that saber-toothed
cat, huh?

20:57.890 --> 20:59.592
If they're anything
like regular rhinos,

20:59.626 --> 21:00.836
they'll sleep under thick brush.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.829
So let's start there.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.732
Never knew something so big
could be a needle in a haystack.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.401
Hey. Looks like we
found our needle.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.677
I'm not seeing any
heat signatures.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.512
JACKSON: Maybe
it's cold-blooded.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.524
If it's asleep,
it'd have roughly the same temperature

21:21.548 --> 21:23.316
as the ground.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.318
It should be right
in front of us.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.387
(GPS beeping)

21:27.420 --> 21:29.489
(rumbling)

21:29.522 --> 21:31.691
Earthquake?

21:31.724 --> 21:33.660
(rapid beeping)

21:48.375 --> 21:49.809
(shrieking)

21:49.842 --> 21:52.512
That's not a woolly rhino.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.582
(shrieks)

21:57.750 --> 21:59.352
You're going to be okay.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.889
The boy's name is Gus Miller.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.859
How did this happen?

22:06.893 --> 22:08.428
All I know is some lady in Admin

22:08.461 --> 22:09.696
paid me to get this kid here.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.097
It's gonna be okay.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.641
Can you tell us about
that place you were in?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.467
It was big...

22:14.501 --> 22:17.069
like a cafeteria.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.638
But cold.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.740
We couldn't talk.

22:20.773 --> 22:23.610
Not even whisper
to the other kids.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.613
A girl cried.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.416
They took her away.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.618
I didn't cry.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.120
(sniffles) This is Isaac.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.523
Did you see him?

22:36.556 --> 22:38.090
He said his parents
would rescue us.

22:38.124 --> 22:42.094
No one believed him,
but I guess he was right.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.463
I got to get him back.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.597
He's not going back.

22:44.631 --> 22:45.765
He's not your kid.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.166
He's not yours, either.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.469
And he's not the
property of Reiden.

22:49.502 --> 22:52.104
We're going to take him
back to his parents.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.773
It's okay, come on.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.776
Connect the cables
to the battery.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.645
It'll engage.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.012
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

23:01.881 --> 23:03.550
(buzzes)

23:04.751 --> 23:07.820
(computer trilling)

23:07.854 --> 23:09.055
(loud beep, explosive hiss)

23:12.925 --> 23:14.561
That's not good.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.729
The current just exposed it.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.699
That's a bio-drive.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.933
It's a what?

23:20.967 --> 23:22.702
It's Shepherd technology.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.904
I put the guy who
created it behind bars.

23:24.937 --> 23:27.874
Okay.
Well, let's just get it out.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.709
Any tech that they
created is dangerous.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.544
We need to know
exactly what it does

23:31.578 --> 23:33.713
before we get it out of you.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.014
And I know who to ask.

23:35.047 --> 23:37.817
Where... where are you going?

23:37.850 --> 23:40.019
Who are you gonna talk to?
(pig snorting)

23:40.052 --> 23:41.688
You know I can't go with
you, right?

23:41.721 --> 23:44.924
Still strapped in here. Hello?

23:44.957 --> 23:47.126
(hybrid squawks)
LOGAN: I got this.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.529
(shrieking)

23:52.965 --> 23:54.233
JACKSON: Get in the truck!

23:54.266 --> 23:56.603
What's next? Insult its mother?

23:56.636 --> 23:58.838
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go. Go.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.676
That was close. (Tessa gasps)

24:03.710 --> 24:05.512
Whoa! Oh!

24:05.545 --> 24:07.547
(groaning, glass breaking)

24:13.052 --> 24:15.888
(hybrid squawks)

24:16.989 --> 24:18.224
Come on.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.662
Hold onto something!
TESSA: Hold onto what?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.295
Truck's going over
the edge of the cliff.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.233
(hybrid squawks)

24:34.140 --> 24:37.644
(hybrid squawking)

24:37.677 --> 24:38.911
(gasps)

24:38.945 --> 24:41.047
Dylan?! (groans)

24:42.314 --> 24:44.551
(metallic squeaking,
hybrid squawking)

24:44.584 --> 24:45.584
Guys!

24:49.989 --> 24:52.759
Come on!

24:52.792 --> 24:54.260
(grunts)

24:54.293 --> 24:56.262
(hybrid squawking)

24:56.295 --> 24:58.531
(car creaking)

24:59.832 --> 25:02.201
(grunts)

25:02.234 --> 25:04.737
(hybrid squawking)

25:08.875 --> 25:10.242
(crashing, glass shattering)

25:10.276 --> 25:12.311
(screeching)

25:12.344 --> 25:14.547
(gasping)

25:17.817 --> 25:20.252
GUS: Mommy? Daddy?

25:20.286 --> 25:21.821
MAN: Gus!

25:21.854 --> 25:24.857
Oh... (chuckling)

25:26.993 --> 25:29.195
Hi there.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.702
(keypad beeps, buzzes)

25:39.706 --> 25:42.709
This is a bio-drive your
Shepherd scientists created.

25:42.742 --> 25:43.976
What does it do?

25:44.010 --> 25:45.745
(grunts)

25:48.047 --> 25:50.282
Give me 15 minutes alone
with that blonde girl

25:50.316 --> 25:51.618
and I'll tell you.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.052
Do you want to do
this the hard way?

25:53.085 --> 25:54.754
(electricity crackling)

25:57.089 --> 26:00.993
I need access to
a Shepherd server.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.061
Give me the password.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.630
It's a call/response system.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.599
If you want to know what
that bio-drive does,

26:06.633 --> 26:07.834
you need to take me up there.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.751
Since we already had its
IADG satellite in position,

26:15.775 --> 26:18.678
I used it to track the
hybrid's flight path.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.680
How's your Spanish?

26:20.713 --> 26:23.650
JACKSON: Flew to Mexico? Why?

26:23.683 --> 26:25.685
Can you pull up past imagery?

26:25.718 --> 26:28.621
Yeah. Why?

26:28.655 --> 26:29.922
What are you looking for?

26:29.956 --> 26:32.091
JACKSON: Just focus
in right there.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.993
Keep going back in.
A little further back.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.262
Okay, right there, stop.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.364
Can you push in on that?

26:41.868 --> 26:42.869
That's Abigail.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.807
In the last decade,
all we have seen

26:47.840 --> 26:48.808
is razorback hybrids.

26:48.841 --> 26:49.776
Now two new species

26:49.809 --> 26:52.779
pop up in the span of 48 hours?

26:52.812 --> 26:53.913
Something's happening,

26:53.946 --> 26:56.949
and Abigail is at
the center of it.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.753
I'm gonna prep the chopper.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.722
I'll get Tessa.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.760
Jackson...

27:07.794 --> 27:10.797
we both know what
Abigail's capable of.

27:10.830 --> 27:11.731
If Tessa's gonna risk
her life with us,

27:11.764 --> 27:13.900
she deserves to know the
facts, all of them.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.905
(pig grunting, squealing)

27:27.279 --> 27:29.882
Thanks for inviting me to
the weirdest party ever.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.118
Who is that? Is that...

27:32.151 --> 27:34.721
Mansdale. You know the drill.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.856
MITCH: What the hell
is Mansdale doing here?

27:36.889 --> 27:38.925
JAMIE: Not now, Mitch.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.430
Find out what the
bio-drive does.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.543
If you send a distress
signal, you know what happens.

27:49.235 --> 27:51.738
Did I wake up in a
parallel universe?

27:51.771 --> 27:53.139
Is he your prisoner?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.474
Clem is upset.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.885
You died thinking that
you were leaving her

27:56.909 --> 27:57.977
in a world full of hope,

27:58.010 --> 27:59.746
but that's not what happened.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.414
She grew up surrounded
by fear and bleakness,

28:02.448 --> 28:03.850
and you're hung up

28:03.883 --> 28:05.217
on when she had her first beer?

28:05.251 --> 28:06.753
Am I supposed to
not have an opinion

28:06.786 --> 28:07.820
about what went wrong?

28:07.854 --> 28:09.055
Everything went wrong.

28:09.088 --> 28:12.124
The world went wrong,
and she turned out okay.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.126
Got something.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.295
What?

28:16.328 --> 28:17.830
MANSDALE: "BioDrive 1142."

28:17.864 --> 28:20.032
It was designed to
network human thoughts

28:20.066 --> 28:21.901
into a collective consciousness.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.069
It was a failure.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.504
Why was is a failure?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.439
Release me and I'll tell you.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.779
(cries out) MITCH:
Jamie, what the...

28:32.812 --> 28:34.781
JAMIE: Not now, Mitch.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.191
That missed your MP joint.
If I get it out in the next

28:36.215 --> 28:38.250
eight minutes,
it won't cause nerve damage.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.186
Why was it a failure?

28:42.221 --> 28:45.391
JAMIE: All of the test subjects
who had the bio-drive put in

28:45.424 --> 28:47.794
died after three months.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.162
Three months? But...

28:50.196 --> 28:51.998
I was in that tank
for ten years.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.066
Then you don't know your
own expiration date.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.035
Sucks for you.
(Mansdale cries out)

28:56.068 --> 28:58.337
Why would the Shepherds
put the bio-drive in him?

28:58.370 --> 29:01.273
We didn't, all right?
As far as I know.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.876
The program,
it was shut down 13 years ago.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.847
Okay.
Tell me about "Blue Diaspora."

29:07.880 --> 29:09.816
The Shepherds that pulled me

29:09.849 --> 29:11.818
out of the tank,
they kept asking me about it.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.820
"Blue Diaspora," that was, uh,

29:13.853 --> 29:16.022
the name of the project
that created the hybrids.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.365
All right?
That's all that I know.

29:17.389 --> 29:20.026
I swear. Please. Please!

29:20.059 --> 29:22.962
I have no idea how that
thing got inside you.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.865
(groans)

29:25.898 --> 29:27.834
Why would they ask you
about Blue Diaspora?

29:27.867 --> 29:28.968
I don't know.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.803
But it's probably why this thing

29:30.837 --> 29:31.904
is still in my head.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.010
MAN: Okay, buckle up tight.
(car door shuts)

29:40.479 --> 29:42.849
How'd this all happen?

29:42.882 --> 29:45.017
A corporation taking children
from their own homes?

29:45.051 --> 29:47.053
With the help of the U.S.
military.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.921
We're so sorry about Isaac.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.289
What you two did for us,

29:50.322 --> 29:52.024
it's-it's beyond words.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.560
We're just glad
Gus is home safe.

29:54.593 --> 29:57.930
Is there anything we can do
to to repay you, to help you?

29:57.964 --> 30:01.033
Just keep Gus safe,
and leave town immediately.

30:01.067 --> 30:04.470
Head east while the military
protocol isn't in effect.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.805
We'll find another
way to get Isaac back.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.152
What's this?

30:20.186 --> 30:21.954
Mom?

30:24.290 --> 30:26.025
Get out of the car!
Let's go, hurry up!

30:27.293 --> 30:28.594
Let's go, let's go!

30:28.627 --> 30:30.196
Come on, get out.
GUS: Dad, help!

30:30.229 --> 30:32.064
Go, go, go.

30:32.098 --> 30:33.866
WOMAN: It's gonna be okay, Gus.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.620
Honey, I'm right here,
I'm right behind you.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.580
I feel like shooting our
way into the facility

30:38.604 --> 30:40.039
and getting him out.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.974
Not a bad idea.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.276
I wasn't being serious.

30:44.310 --> 30:47.079
We don't have the manpower.
It would be suicide.

30:51.984 --> 30:54.220
We can't be coming up with
reasons not to do something.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.031
Don't you think we've had
enough reckless actions

30:56.055 --> 30:57.399
in this household to
last ten lifetimes?

30:57.423 --> 31:00.426
Abe... Dariela...

31:02.394 --> 31:04.263
SOLDIER: Stand down, stand down.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.632
Target acquired.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.035
SOLDIER: Clear.

31:10.402 --> 31:13.872
Sorry for the intrusion, Mr. and Mrs.
Kenyatta.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.344
I'm Leanne Ducovny.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.146
We should talk.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.454
Hey, there's something
I need to tell you.

31:28.487 --> 31:32.491
About time. I'm not an idiot.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.194
You've been conspiring
with Detective Trench Coat

31:35.227 --> 31:36.495
since he got here.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.165
Talk to me.

31:39.198 --> 31:42.068
My name...

31:42.101 --> 31:45.972
is not... Dylan Green.

31:48.407 --> 31:52.311
It's... Jackson Oz.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.947
That's not funny.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.219
Okay.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.130
This is Jackson Oz.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.731
You are not Jackson Oz.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.300
No, it's not.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.068
A friend of mine created a virus

32:16.102 --> 32:17.503
that poisoned every
search engine.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.238
When you look for a photo of me,

32:19.271 --> 32:20.711
it's replaced by
that doctored image.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.977
I am so sorry.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.013
I didn't meant for...
You're Robert Oz's son?

32:28.480 --> 32:31.583
Tessa, please.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.019
I didn't help my father.

32:33.052 --> 32:36.122
I tried to stop him.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.624
But nobody wants to believe
that, okay?

32:38.657 --> 32:41.193
Especially the Shepherd
hunters; they nearly caught me,

32:41.227 --> 32:44.030
killed me numerous
times, so I came west,

32:44.063 --> 32:47.166
changed my name, kept
moving, and then I met you.

32:47.199 --> 32:50.102
I know this is hard to believe,

32:50.136 --> 32:52.171
but I promise you,
the man that you've spent

32:52.204 --> 32:55.041
the last three years with,

32:55.074 --> 32:58.610
that's who I really am, okay?

32:58.644 --> 33:02.148
You didn't just...
make me forget about my past,

33:02.181 --> 33:03.782
you made me see a future.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.251
A future with you.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.288
Why are you telling
me this right now?

33:09.321 --> 33:13.125
We're about to go to Mexico to
find Abigail and those hybrids.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.694
Because...

33:15.727 --> 33:20.132
Abigail Westbrook...

33:20.166 --> 33:21.567
is my sister.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.270
(soft chuckle)

33:24.303 --> 33:27.073
I didn't even know
I had a sister.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.774
You know,
I couldn't stop my father,

33:28.807 --> 33:30.609
but maybe I can stop her.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.211
And I need you.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.445
I need you with me.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.747
I can't do this without you.

33:35.781 --> 33:38.084
Okay? I...

33:38.117 --> 33:39.685
I need you.

33:50.762 --> 33:55.301
You said what we had was real,
but it was built on a lie.

33:55.334 --> 33:58.237
Not a little white lie,
a pretty damn huge one.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.642
Tessa!

34:03.675 --> 34:05.711
Good-bye, Jackson.

34:25.431 --> 34:29.235
CLEMENTINE: Do you even know what
you're apologizing for? (pig snorting)

34:29.268 --> 34:31.536
I can't help it if I
woke up after ten years

34:31.570 --> 34:33.205
in not the greatest mood.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.841
Listening to all those
childhood moments

34:35.873 --> 34:37.609
you had with Jamie,

34:37.643 --> 34:40.346
my dad,

34:40.379 --> 34:43.215
Logan...

34:43.248 --> 34:47.253
it's hard.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.853
But why?

34:48.887 --> 34:50.755
That doesn't make any sense.

34:50.789 --> 34:54.226
So my life wasn't
all doom and gloom.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.428
Why are you upset about that?

34:59.198 --> 35:00.766
Because if your
life was so great,

35:00.799 --> 35:02.834
then you never really needed me.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.807
I died,

35:08.840 --> 35:10.276
and life moved on without me.

35:10.309 --> 35:14.213
And then I woke up.

35:14.246 --> 35:17.349
There's no baseline for that.

35:17.383 --> 35:21.387
My life was not great.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.489
I was an orphan.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.857
It got lonely and sad,

35:25.891 --> 35:29.561
but you know what got me
through my darkest days?

35:32.598 --> 35:35.867
Knowing that my dad
was Mitch Morgan,

35:35.901 --> 35:39.805
the hero that sacrificed
himself to save the world.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.840
(monitor beeping rapidly)

35:43.742 --> 35:45.577
You have to get out
of this room now.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.679
What?

35:48.914 --> 35:52.351
That induction ammeter...

35:52.384 --> 35:56.488
it'll spike if I get too
emotional, so...

35:56.522 --> 35:58.257
get out.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.226
(steady beeping)

36:00.259 --> 36:01.827
(beeping increases)

36:01.860 --> 36:04.263
Get out.

36:06.265 --> 36:09.368
Mitch, I went over the data.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.936
Every BioDrive that was left in

36:10.969 --> 36:12.371
ended in death.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.639
The ones that they pulled out

36:13.672 --> 36:16.308
caused total memory loss.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.811
So if we remove it,
you'll forget me, Jamie...

36:19.845 --> 36:21.280
everything.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.215
And if we leave it in...

36:24.783 --> 36:26.618
it'll kill me.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.526
It's a pleasure to finally meet
you, Dr. Kenyatta.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.362
What is this about?

36:36.395 --> 36:37.896
Earlier today,

36:37.929 --> 36:41.833
I received a call from one
of my department heads.

36:41.867 --> 36:46.605
Well, it turns out that one of
our couriers had quite a story.

36:46.638 --> 36:51.843
Being paid to sneak a
child out of our facility,

36:51.877 --> 36:56.315
a boy... named Isaac Kenyatta.

36:58.584 --> 37:01.920
Well,
this courier was quite rattled

37:01.953 --> 37:04.523
after you took Gus
Miller from him.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.925
Which you had no legal right to
do, I may add.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.994
You had no legal
right to take our son.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.829
We returned Gus to his parents.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.864
What did you do to them?
LEANNE: Relax.

37:12.898 --> 37:13.899
The Millers are fine.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.635
But when I heard
the name Kenyatta,

37:16.668 --> 37:18.304
I recognized it.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.806
I've seen your research,
it's quite impressive.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.008
And despite what
you might think,

37:23.041 --> 37:25.444
I am not completely heartless.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.245
So I'm here to offer you a deal.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.617
I can get Isaac back.

37:31.650 --> 37:32.851
Here.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.286
Look.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.756
Daddy! Daddy!

37:40.326 --> 37:41.960
I will give you all
the research you need

37:41.993 --> 37:43.662
in return for my son.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.398
Let's talk about
Clementine Lewis.

37:49.901 --> 37:50.978
DARIELA: What does Clementine

37:51.002 --> 37:52.046
have anything to do with this?

37:52.070 --> 37:53.505
Well, she's very special.

37:53.539 --> 37:54.973
A girl that you
may think you know,

37:55.006 --> 37:56.975
but she's a liar and a thief.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.378
She stole intellectual property

37:59.411 --> 38:01.313
and I need it back.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.882
It's that simple;
you want Isaac,

38:03.915 --> 38:06.051
you bring me Clementine Lewis.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.395
I took the schematics
that Mansdale got

38:16.428 --> 38:18.664
and put the bio-drive in sleep
mode, so...

38:18.697 --> 38:21.867
it won't transmit anything.

38:23.869 --> 38:24.936
I'm leaving it in.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.342
But you'll die.

38:30.376 --> 38:34.546
Well, it's that,
or I'll live with no memories.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.751
No thank you.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.953
I've already missed too much.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.390
I don't want to
lose anything else.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.129
I promise you,

38:51.162 --> 38:53.932
we will find a way out of this.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.501
We'll find out who did this

38:55.534 --> 38:57.369
and we'll get this
thing out of my head,

38:57.403 --> 38:59.938
but for right now, it stays.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.574
Just patch me up.

39:06.077 --> 39:10.449
Okay, so, um...

39:10.482 --> 39:12.984
tell me about everything
that I missed.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.020
Graduation...

39:17.122 --> 39:19.891
Oh, God, please tell you did
graduate high school at least,

39:19.925 --> 39:22.060
didn't you?

39:23.929 --> 39:27.466
You had something that
you wanted to say earlier.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.100
What... what was that?

39:29.134 --> 39:30.969
Um...

39:31.002 --> 39:35.441
Dad, I know you've only been
awake a couple of days, but...

39:37.909 --> 39:42.180
I just wanted to tell
you that I love you.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.015
I'm really happy you're back.

39:44.049 --> 39:48.420
Me, too.

39:48.454 --> 39:50.055
All right.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.990
Let's get you out of this.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.837
JAMIE (echoing): Mitch?

40:05.871 --> 40:06.905
Mitch?

40:06.938 --> 40:10.175
Mitch?

40:10.208 --> 40:11.176
You just blacked out.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.844
I know where I was

40:12.878 --> 40:14.613
when they put the
bio-drive in my head.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.848
We have to go there.

40:16.882 --> 40:19.618
All right,
I'll prep for takeoff.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.028
JACKSON: The
hybrids aren't here.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.797
Abigail might be.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.499
JACKSON: Okay, move in.

40:33.532 --> 40:34.800
Yeah.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.194
Mitch?

41:05.196 --> 41:07.733
Jackson?

41:07.766 --> 41:09.601
You're alive?

41:09.635 --> 41:11.102
Uh...

41:14.239 --> 41:15.741
yeah.

41:15.774 --> 41:18.710
How are you here right now?

41:18.744 --> 41:20.712
I don't know.

41:20.746 --> 41:24.082
I mean, I-I know this place,
but I've never been here before,

41:24.115 --> 41:27.085
and now you're here, and...

41:27.118 --> 41:29.688
Okay, and you.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.257
Jackson?

41:32.290 --> 41:34.125
Clementine?

41:34.159 --> 41:35.827
Logan?

41:35.861 --> 41:37.896
Well, this is more
than a little weird.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.097
LOGAN: How are you all here?

41:39.130 --> 41:40.666
What is that thing?

41:50.141 --> 41:52.778
JACKSON: This disc,
this is the exact same one

41:52.811 --> 41:54.255
that the woman we're hunting
left behind in Portland.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.214
(phone ringing)

41:59.284 --> 42:00.619
Hello?

42:00.652 --> 42:02.988
Don't you just love
a family reunion?

42:03.021 --> 42:04.790
Maybe we'll have one one day.

42:04.823 --> 42:08.226
Listen to me,
I want you to understand something,

42:08.259 --> 42:11.930
I am going to find you
and I'm gonna stop you.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.331
Do you get that?

42:13.364 --> 42:17.235
You should stop worrying about
me, Jackson.

42:17.268 --> 42:19.871
Start worrying about yourself.

42:19.905 --> 42:22.207
(phone beeps)

42:22.240 --> 42:24.640
(box whirring and beeping) And
that thing just started moving.

42:25.644 --> 42:28.179
Hey! We got to get out of here!

42:29.380 --> 42:30.916
Guys.

42:32.951 --> 42:36.087
(screeching)

42:36.121 --> 42:39.024
Abigail's bringing the
hybrids here to our location.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.960
I think they're about
to move under us!

42:45.130 --> 42:46.297
And then what?
