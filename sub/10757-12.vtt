WEBVTT

00:09.725 --> 00:14.276
Well, look who's here.
It's KACL's Frasier Crane.

00:14.646 --> 00:16.158
And Rosemary's Bebe.

00:18.275 --> 00:20.835
Quite a shake-up
going on down at the station.

00:21.111 --> 00:24.023
The new owner's
renegotiating everyone's contract.

00:24.323 --> 00:28.794
Before you drop another hint,
my feelings about you haven't changed.

00:29.161 --> 00:31.391
I'm here to meet
one of my newer clients,

00:31.663 --> 00:34.416
a rising star of the Seattle airwaves.

00:34.708 --> 00:37.745
What pathetic dupe
have you lured into your web?

00:38.045 --> 00:39.524
Roz.

00:40.255 --> 00:44.043
- Oh, dear God.
- You get off your feet, little mother.

00:44.384 --> 00:47.376
I'll fetch you a nice nourishing muffin.

00:52.809 --> 00:55.881
- You signed to Bebe?
- OK, I should have told you.

00:56.188 --> 00:58.463
I wasn't in the mood for a lecture.

00:58.732 --> 01:01.644
You're entitled to choose
whoever you wish.

01:01.943 --> 01:03.934
Someone who's honest or whose ethics

01:04.196 --> 01:07.871
would've raised eyebrows
in the court of Caligula.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.919
She's got me three voice-over jobs.

01:11.203 --> 01:14.240
She may be shifty
but she helps me put food on the table.

01:14.539 --> 01:16.530
- One muffin.
- See?

01:16.792 --> 01:18.783
I had a brainstorm

01:19.044 --> 01:23.435
about how
to turn this bundle of joy into cash.

01:23.799 --> 01:25.391
Use my baby to make money?

01:25.634 --> 01:29.024
It's high time the little slacker
started pulling his weight.

01:30.138 --> 01:34.609
Dr Clint Webber's medical show.
I see a daily segment called

01:35.102 --> 01:40.051
<i>A Pregnant Pause:
Roz Doyle's Term of Endearment.</i>

01:40.440 --> 01:43.796
All of Seattle will share in the miracle
happening inside you.

01:44.111 --> 01:47.706
Your joys, hopes, morning sickness,
sonograms, even the birth.

01:48.031 --> 01:51.819
- I'll give birth on the air?
- It's radio. Just make the noises.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.594
Hell, I'll make them myself.

01:56.748 --> 01:59.706
- Need anything else here?
- Just a shower, thank you.

02:00.627 --> 02:02.379
You know, Mr Integrity,

02:02.629 --> 02:06.304
you still haven't hired anyone
to negotiate this big deal for you.

02:06.633 --> 02:10.068
Could it be because
you know you want to come back to me?

02:10.387 --> 02:13.026
I'm determined
to make the right choice.

02:13.307 --> 02:17.061
- You'll need somebody good.
- I intend to find someone good.

02:17.394 --> 02:19.385
It's possible to find an agent

02:19.646 --> 02:23.400
who can drive a hard bargain
and maintain high ethical standards.

02:23.734 --> 02:25.645
Happy hunting.

02:25.902 --> 02:28.780
If things don't work out,
you know my number.

02:29.072 --> 02:31.063
Still 666, is it?

02:34.411 --> 02:38.689
Dad, we had a mix-up last night
with our bags at the video store.

02:39.041 --> 02:41.680
- Believe me, I noticed.
- There you go.

02:41.960 --> 02:46.795
I was dismayed to see Charles Bronson
blowing away street trash.

02:48.383 --> 02:50.613
But it was quite suspenseful.

02:50.886 --> 02:54.322
That's the way Duke and I felt
about <i>My Dinner with Andre.</i>

02:56.016 --> 02:58.007
Talk about suspense.

02:58.268 --> 03:01.385
Will they order dessert?
Will they leave a good tip?

03:03.565 --> 03:06.159
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, sorry to trouble you

03:06.443 --> 03:09.355
but could you recommend
another couples therapist?

03:09.655 --> 03:12.169
What happened to Dr Prescott?

03:12.449 --> 03:16.567
Maris had me can Dr Prescott weeks ago.
Now she wants me to fire Dr Wilfong.

03:16.912 --> 03:20.268
- What's wrong with him?
- His criticism of her is too harsh.

03:20.582 --> 03:24.211
Some therapists can be rather blunt.
What did he say?

03:24.544 --> 03:28.583
He asked her to refrain from
catalogue shopping during our sessions.

03:29.925 --> 03:34.396
If you fire every therapist that finds
fault with her, you won't make progress.

03:34.763 --> 03:38.199
You're right. I'll tell her,
we're not going to change.

03:38.517 --> 03:39.950
- That's that.
- Good.

03:40.185 --> 03:43.621
There's nothing more rewarding
than sticking to a principle.

03:43.939 --> 03:49.935
Case in point, Bebe Glazer's been
angling to negotiate my new contract.

03:50.362 --> 03:53.320
I could have said yes,
taken the money and run.

03:53.615 --> 03:57.927
But, instead, I said no
and I found myself a new agent,

03:58.286 --> 04:01.084
one who's every bit as smart
and also ethical.

04:01.373 --> 04:03.011
That's him now.

04:03.250 --> 04:07.163
I don't know what he said but there's
no such thing as an ethical agent.

04:07.504 --> 04:09.972
One's just as slimy as the other.

04:10.590 --> 04:14.902
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I was making
my last Meals on Wheels delivery

04:15.262 --> 04:17.935
and I swerved to avoid a pigeon.

04:19.099 --> 04:22.933
Then splat went the food all over
the stuffed bears for the toy drive.

04:23.270 --> 04:25.261
I had to throw the bears in the wash

04:25.522 --> 04:28.594
and cook some more borscht
for Mrs Popov.

04:29.818 --> 04:32.173
This is my brother, Dr Niles Crane. Ben.

04:32.446 --> 04:35.244
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I'm sorry I'm running out.

04:35.532 --> 04:38.763
You're a refreshing change
from Frasier's last agent.

04:39.077 --> 04:41.068
She would've swerved to hit the pigeon.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.890
She would've swerved to hit Mrs Popov.

04:44.333 --> 04:48.326
Ben, meet my dad, Martin, and this
is his home healthcare worker, Daphne.

04:48.670 --> 04:51.787
- This is Ben, my new agent.
- Very nice to meet you.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.240
You're a pretty busy volunteer.

04:54.509 --> 04:57.626
Ben just won
this year's Seattle Samaritan Award.

04:57.929 --> 05:00.887
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you. May I?

05:01.183 --> 05:03.174
Before we start this negotiation,

05:03.435 --> 05:07.633
it wouldn't hurt to raise your
public profile. OK, here's my plan.

05:07.981 --> 05:10.814
For a year I've worked
for the Mercer Island Zoo.

05:11.109 --> 05:15.341
- Creating awareness.
- There's a zoo on Mercer Island?

05:15.697 --> 05:18.086
You bet. This will be great PR
for both of you.

05:18.367 --> 05:20.597
They just bought a rare crane.

05:20.869 --> 05:25.021
I convinced them to name it after you.
You know, Frasier Crane.

05:25.374 --> 05:28.571
There'll be a ceremony
with full newspaper and TV coverage.

05:28.877 --> 05:33.234
It's brilliant. It bolsters my
bargaining position and helps out a zoo.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.581
I love this man.

05:35.842 --> 05:38.356
It would be fun to have a crane
named after me.

05:38.637 --> 05:42.676
I just love those big pouchy mouths
they scoop up the fish in.

05:43.016 --> 05:45.246
- I think those are pelicans.
- Oh, right.

05:45.519 --> 05:48.989
Cranes are the ones
who always sound like they're laughing.

05:49.314 --> 05:51.703
No, wait, I'm thinking of loons.

05:52.693 --> 05:55.048
That's a coincidence.

05:56.405 --> 05:58.839
Shoot, I got borscht on my sleeve.

05:59.116 --> 06:02.313
- Do you have any club soda?
- Right through here.

06:04.788 --> 06:08.144
Frasier, are you sure
you want to send in that Mouseketeer?

06:08.458 --> 06:12.974
Why do you assume that to be an agent
you have to be an unscrupulous huckster?

06:13.338 --> 06:16.057
It is possible for a decent man
to be as intimidating

06:16.341 --> 06:18.332
as the toughest shark out there.

06:18.593 --> 06:20.982
Time to skedaddle.

06:21.263 --> 06:22.662
I have to pick up a friend.

06:22.889 --> 06:26.848
The poor guy just went bankrupt,
so he's bunking in our rumpus room.

06:27.185 --> 06:28.379
That's generous of you.

06:28.603 --> 06:31.481
Well, he's not just a friend.
He's a client.

06:39.197 --> 06:42.746
The press and the board members
will join us in here for a buffet.

06:43.076 --> 06:46.512
So I finish my speech and
then give Mr Twembly the cue,

06:46.830 --> 06:49.549
and he brings out
this marvellous creature.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.186
Just give me the signal.

06:51.418 --> 06:54.251
This is great.
Look at this. Turkey, chicken wings.

06:55.172 --> 06:57.208
Got to make you a little nervous, huh?

06:58.133 --> 07:02.046
Look, it's Toffee Macintosh
from the news. I just love her.

07:02.387 --> 07:05.504
- Frasier.
- Toffee, thank you for covering us.

07:05.807 --> 07:10.244
You know my motto. "lf it
happens in Seattle, it's news to me".

07:10.604 --> 07:14.119
I'd like you to meet one
of your biggest fans, Daphne Moon.

07:14.441 --> 07:18.400
I love the way you get all sombre
when you describe a flood or a murder.

07:18.737 --> 07:21.615
Then you cheer right up
the minute you're done.

07:22.783 --> 07:25.900
It makes me think,
"lf she can get over it, so can l".

07:26.203 --> 07:28.273
That's what I'm here for.

07:28.538 --> 07:30.768
- Ready to greet your public?
- Come on, Dad.

07:31.041 --> 07:32.440
I'll be there in a sec.

07:32.668 --> 07:37.458
See what maternal instincts this
woman has. Even Bobo here can sense it.

07:37.839 --> 07:40.831
I'm not the only one
getting some publicity today.

07:41.134 --> 07:44.922
- Frasier, they want to start.
- Ben, I'd like you to meet some people.

07:45.263 --> 07:48.539
This is Bebe and Roz.
This is Ben, my new agent.

07:48.850 --> 07:49.839
- Hi.
- Hi, Ben.

07:50.060 --> 07:55.692
Small world. Mr Twembly and I sang for
the same choir in Salt Lake City.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.860
Nice meeting you, ladies.

07:58.110 --> 08:03.025
Well, when there's a dirty job to be
done, you can't go wrong with a Mormon.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.079
Scoff all you like.
The man is a genius of PR.

08:10.956 --> 08:14.551
Good afternoon.
On behalf of the Mercer Island Zoo,

08:14.876 --> 08:19.427
I would like to welcome our
very special guest, Dr Frasier Crane.

08:22.968 --> 08:25.163
Thank you, Mr Twembly.

08:26.138 --> 08:29.210
It's appropriate
that the zoo has called upon me

08:29.516 --> 08:31.905
to introduce you all
to its newest resident.

08:32.184 --> 08:35.336
You see,
he happens to be a relative of mine.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.034
What're you looking at?
This is human food.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.517
You don't see me
looking at your bird food, do you?

08:46.283 --> 08:49.116
What are you doing?
That's not very nice.

08:49.411 --> 08:52.448
Wait. No. Where are you going?

08:53.248 --> 08:56.206
We're both tall
and have distinctive profiles.

08:56.501 --> 08:59.254
We've both been known
to winter in Mexico.

09:00.297 --> 09:02.857
And let's not forget our voices.

09:03.133 --> 09:07.365
Is there anything as stirring
as the crane's majestic cry?

09:08.680 --> 09:12.275
- Get it off me!
- Dad, are you all right?

09:12.601 --> 09:15.877
My goodness, what is going on?

09:16.188 --> 09:18.748
I'm sorry. Nothing to be alarmed about.

09:19.024 --> 09:21.982
Just a little family squabble.

09:26.073 --> 09:28.268
<i>In a shocking and gruesome incident,</i>

09:28.533 --> 09:32.208
<i>the Mercer Island Zoo seemed
more like the Island of Doctor Moreau,</i>

09:32.537 --> 09:35.813
<i>as a disabled senior citizen
was savagely attacked</i>

09:36.124 --> 09:38.957
<i>by Frasier Crane, bird of prey.</i>

09:39.252 --> 09:41.891
- I can't watch this.
- I can't hear any of it.

09:42.172 --> 09:45.642
You weren't hurt badly. You
wouldn't know that to listen to Toffee.

09:45.968 --> 09:51.565
- She makes it sound like a disaster.
- But she could smile right after.

09:56.687 --> 09:59.440
This affair
has turned into a PR nightmare.

09:59.731 --> 10:03.440
It's your own fault for hiring
Howdy Doody as your agent.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.476
Ben had no idea
that bird was going to attack you.

10:08.782 --> 10:12.695
Besides, there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

10:18.500 --> 10:23.494
The radio are offering a cash prize
for the best Frasier Crane joke.

10:23.880 --> 10:28.396
What was the front-runner? How can you
tell Frasier the crane's a psychiatrist?

10:28.760 --> 10:29.829
I can't wait to hear.

10:30.053 --> 10:33.250
He ignores what you say,
then sticks you with a large bill.

10:37.811 --> 10:42.248
Forgive my jolly mood but Maris was
over for our weekly conjugal visit.

10:45.152 --> 10:49.543
She looked so seductive. She
wore a clingy gown, crimson lipstick,

10:49.906 --> 10:54.184
even earrings, which she tends to avoid
as they make her head droop.

10:54.536 --> 10:58.688
She pulled me down upon the bed and
began playing my spine like a zither.

10:59.041 --> 11:03.512
Then as things were heating up, she
requested again I dismiss Dr Wilfong.

11:03.879 --> 11:07.235
So tremulous with desire was l
that I almost relented,

11:07.549 --> 11:11.940
but then I remembered your advice,
Frasier, and I said I wouldn't fire him.

11:12.304 --> 11:17.742
So Maris told me I wouldn't be firing
anything else in the foreseeable future.

11:18.143 --> 11:19.895
And she left.

11:20.145 --> 11:23.615
Withholding sex
can be just as difficult on Maris.

11:23.940 --> 11:28.889
Are you serious? One hour
of passion can sustain her for months.

11:29.821 --> 11:32.415
She stores it up like some sexual camel.

11:33.575 --> 11:36.612
All right, Niles,
you know that my advice was solid.

11:36.912 --> 11:38.311
I hope you're right.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.730
I'll get it.

11:41.917 --> 11:45.114
- Hello. Hello, Roz. It's Roz.
- Thank you.

11:46.171 --> 11:48.162
Roz, hello. Yes, what is it?

11:48.423 --> 11:51.256
- That's a striking arrangement.
- It's from Bebe.

11:51.551 --> 11:53.860
She's trying to woo him back.

11:54.137 --> 11:57.527
Birds of paradise. I suppose
that's her idea of floral irony.

12:00.978 --> 12:02.969
Thanks for the warning, Roz.

12:03.230 --> 12:05.539
- Bye-bye.
- What's that about?

12:05.816 --> 12:10.446
The station manager won't be
renegotiating the contracts himself.

12:10.821 --> 12:15.497
Apparently he's brought in one of these
hired guns stations use to reduce costs.

12:16.368 --> 12:20.600
- Some fellow nicknamed "The Hammer".
- "The Hammer" because he's tough?

12:20.956 --> 12:24.426
No, Niles, because he loves
the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein.

12:26.169 --> 12:28.558
If I were you, I'd give Bebe a call.

12:28.839 --> 12:31.273
This is a pretty big negotiation.

12:31.550 --> 12:34.223
No, Dad, I am sticking with Ben.

12:34.970 --> 12:38.485
Maybe Bebe could use her dark arts
to get me a dollar or two more,

12:38.807 --> 12:41.082
but my integrity
is worth more than that.

12:41.351 --> 12:44.229
- Hey, big guy. How are you doing?
- I'm fine.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.510
People are being mean about this.

12:48.775 --> 12:51.573
I was listening to the radio
on the way over. Ouch.

12:51.862 --> 12:54.854
I always say, "lf life
hands you a lemon, make lemonade".

12:55.157 --> 12:59.230
- So you've got a damage control plan?
- I got a way to turn this mess around

12:59.578 --> 13:02.411
and show that station manager
what you're made of.

13:02.706 --> 13:06.665
Excellent. But you'll be dealing
with a freelancer they call the Hammer.

13:09.171 --> 13:13.164
- You've gone up against him?
- I had to take a firm line with him.

13:13.508 --> 13:16.580
I finally said,
"You just clean up your language, pal."

13:16.887 --> 13:20.436
"l walked out of that Mamet play,
I can walk out on you".

13:24.227 --> 13:28.982
- So, about your plan.
- I think there's a way to show people

13:29.358 --> 13:32.316
you're laughing with them.
You do a photo op where you,

13:32.611 --> 13:35.921
Seattle's best-loved psychiatrist,
give the crane therapy.

13:36.239 --> 13:40.835
You sit in a chair with a pad on your
lap, and the crane, properly sedated,

13:41.203 --> 13:43.319
sits on...

13:43.580 --> 13:44.569
this.

13:50.379 --> 13:53.735
- Where did you find a couch that size?
- I built it myself.

13:54.049 --> 13:58.042
I have a workshop in my attic where l
make toys for the neighbourhood kids.

13:59.012 --> 14:02.084
Look at you. Agent, Samaritan,

14:02.391 --> 14:04.302
elf.

14:04.559 --> 14:08.029
Dad, I like this idea.
It's droll and self-mocking.

14:08.355 --> 14:11.745
It's a way to turn
a PR embarrassment into a triumph.

14:12.067 --> 14:15.537
Great. I'll set up the photo op.
Don't be nervous about the Hammer.

14:15.862 --> 14:18.057
I can be a tough customer myself.

14:18.323 --> 14:21.156
I know you're going to give him hell.

14:21.451 --> 14:25.126
I love show folk,
but I'll never get used to the cursing.

Latte, please.

14:44.433 --> 14:46.822
Didn't I see your picture
in the paper today?

14:47.102 --> 14:50.333
There was a big bird
chasing you around a little couch.

14:55.777 --> 14:57.574
Latte, please.

15:00.949 --> 15:04.942
I think you have a real case against
the maker of those crane sedatives.

15:08.498 --> 15:12.616
I just wish they'd named
the damned bird after somebody else.

15:12.961 --> 15:14.952
Gregory Peck, perhaps.

15:17.299 --> 15:19.290
Thank you for the sympathy.

15:19.551 --> 15:24.784
You're not the only one having a rough
patch. My libido is at breaking point.

15:25.182 --> 15:27.776
- You can't give in.
- I am getting desperate.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.449
This morning I flirted
with my manicurist.

15:30.729 --> 15:34.165
- The one with the thing on her face?
- I told you, I'm desperate.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.892
What can be keeping Ben?

15:38.153 --> 15:42.669
After all this, you're still using Ben?
Shouldn't you just go back to Bebe?

15:43.033 --> 15:46.992
You think if I bail on my principles, it
gives you an excuse to go back to Maris.

15:47.329 --> 15:51.242
Well, I won't do it. Ben may have made
some mistakes, but he is a good man.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.414
He's going to make me a good deal.

15:53.669 --> 15:56.183
Gil. How did it go with the Hammer?

15:56.463 --> 16:02.413
You've never seen such cold, dead eyes.
It was like bargaining with Nosferatu.

16:04.221 --> 16:07.213
- My salary's been slashed.
- I'm sorry.

16:07.516 --> 16:11.111
- Anything else for you?
- Would you nibble this provocatively?

16:11.436 --> 16:12.755
Niles!

16:15.565 --> 16:17.157
We're fine, thank you.

16:19.111 --> 16:21.102
I wish you good luck, Frasier.

16:21.363 --> 16:24.196
Nobody can squeeze blood
from that stone.

16:24.491 --> 16:26.482
Lattes for everyone.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.776
Don't tell me you did well?

16:29.037 --> 16:33.428
I got a weekly spot on Clint Webber's
show and a 30% raise.

16:33.792 --> 16:37.580
- How did you get all that?
- We go way back, the Hammer and I.

16:37.921 --> 16:40.071
I know where the bodies are buried.

16:40.340 --> 16:43.298
Usually that's just a metaphor.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.739
So, Gil, what'll you have? My treat.

16:49.016 --> 16:52.804
I'll be happier at the losers' table
with Aunt Penny, the Story Lady.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.181
Penny, don't put that flask away.

16:58.525 --> 17:01.244
Well, congratulations, Roz.

17:01.528 --> 17:05.203
I'm waiting for Ben. We have
to discuss our bargaining position.

17:05.531 --> 17:09.127
There are so many to choose from:
kneeling, crawling, grovelling.

17:09.453 --> 17:12.172
I'm sure he'll pick the right one.

17:12.748 --> 17:15.057
God, she is obnoxious.

17:15.334 --> 17:18.132
Though alluring,
in a buxom-bad-girl kind of way.

17:19.838 --> 17:22.227
Shut up, you horny idiot.

17:26.011 --> 17:30.084
My bandage is loose. If Ben gets here,
just tell him I went in to fix it.

17:38.815 --> 17:40.328
We have to talk.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.842
Are you aware you are in the men's room?

17:43.111 --> 17:46.308
If I paid attention to signs
with pictures on them,

17:46.615 --> 17:48.970
I'd never get a parking space.

17:52.287 --> 17:56.075
It's time we dropped the masks.
You need me and I want you back.

17:56.416 --> 18:01.206
Sign this contract. I'll cut you a deal
to make Roz's look like lunch money.

18:01.588 --> 18:05.297
Isn't there a zebra carcass somewhere
you should be hovering over?

18:07.135 --> 18:10.047
You want to see a carcass?
Go look in the mirror.

18:10.347 --> 18:12.815
Look what you've let that man
do to you.

18:13.100 --> 18:16.410
Your face is riddled with bird bites,
your name's a punchline

18:16.728 --> 18:19.003
and your career
is five minutes from over.

18:19.272 --> 18:22.548
And he's only been your agent
for three days.

18:24.903 --> 18:28.134
Send him in against the Hammer
and you'll be doing fog reports

18:28.448 --> 18:30.678
from a lighthouse in Puget Sound.

18:31.910 --> 18:36.108
- Admit it, you're scared.
- All right, maybe I am scared.

18:36.456 --> 18:40.847
But there's one thing
that's stronger than fear. Faith.

18:41.211 --> 18:44.362
Faith that a good man with a good heart
can make a good deal.

18:44.673 --> 18:47.585
- Now get out of my way.
- No, I won't let you.

18:47.884 --> 18:51.081
You know what I've been through
building your career?

18:51.388 --> 18:55.745
I have been to hell and back
so often I have frequent flyer miles.

18:57.894 --> 19:00.089
You owe me a second chance.

19:00.355 --> 19:03.267
Take your tentacles off of me.

19:04.943 --> 19:08.458
Please. I won't be the same Bebe
you knew. I'll change.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.294
I'll be like Ben...

19:11.575 --> 19:13.566
only competent.

19:15.329 --> 19:18.560
Darling, you forgot to sign.

19:18.874 --> 19:21.263
You've reconciled.
I'll be off to Maris's.

19:21.543 --> 19:23.659
Sit down, Niles.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.115
I'm still with Ben.

19:26.381 --> 19:29.896
I took my son's troop on a nature hike
and Noah got a bee sting.

19:30.218 --> 19:32.573
I rushed him to the ER
and came straight here.

19:32.846 --> 19:35.485
- We've got five minutes.
- Excuse me.

19:35.766 --> 19:37.996
Bebe can make you a better deal.

19:38.268 --> 19:40.384
- Listen to Roz.
- Listen to Niles.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.637
I won't listen to any of you.

19:42.898 --> 19:46.447
Am I the last man still willing
to stand up for a principle?

19:46.777 --> 19:49.416
Shall we go over those demands
for old Mr Hammer?

19:56.161 --> 19:58.550
Ben, could we have a word?

19:59.873 --> 20:01.864
Hello, Maris?

20:09.257 --> 20:13.694
I don't think it's news to you that
things haven't been going so smoothly.

20:15.222 --> 20:18.578
I think I'd feel more comfortable
with Bebe.

20:18.892 --> 20:21.360
This must seem
a bit of a shock to you, but...

20:21.645 --> 20:25.638
Heck, no. I saw this coming.
When you threw that couch at me,

20:25.983 --> 20:28.702
I thought to myself,
"This is not a happy client".

20:31.321 --> 20:33.312
Thanks for understanding.

20:35.492 --> 20:37.130
Taxi!

20:40.914 --> 20:43.030
Sign right here, darling.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.803
I'm holding you
to that promise about changing.

20:47.087 --> 20:50.602
- I won't stand for any shady doings.
- Those days are all behind me.

20:50.924 --> 20:55.076
Maybe you can see what you can do about
diffusing this bird situation.

20:55.429 --> 20:57.659
You don't have to worry
about the crane.

20:57.931 --> 21:00.161
It choked to death this morning.

21:00.434 --> 21:03.710
They have no idea
who would feed a bird a jawbreaker.

21:04.021 --> 21:05.249
Bye now.

21:19.661 --> 21:22.937
Bebe, is there any chance it wasn't you?

21:24.708 --> 21:26.380
Darling,

21:29.296 --> 21:31.685
there's always a chance.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.954
I can live with that.
