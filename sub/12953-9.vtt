00:01.008 --> 00:01.768
Previously on Alias.

00:01.862 --> 00:04.333
Our target is someone with whom several of you are quite familiar.

00:04.426 --> 00:05.371
Who is it?

00:06.118 --> 00:07.587
Anna Espinosa.

00:08.615 --> 00:09.684
I thought --

00:10.807 --> 00:13.803
- She's supposed to be dead.
- So are a lot of people.

00:18.713 --> 00:19.417
Here.

00:20.726 --> 00:21.623
Nice work.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.870
It was nice getting to know your sister.

00:25.916 --> 00:27.768
Get your hands off me.

00:37.910 --> 00:39.330
Dispatch, I need backup.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.890
She can have the blouse.

00:42.990 --> 00:45.410
I believe that if the two of you go out on this mission,

00:45.603 --> 00:47.692
and Anna Espinosa has her way,

00:47.833 --> 00:52.453
that only one of you will return home alive.

00:55.304 --> 00:57.253
- Let's take her.
- Bad idea.

00:58.701 --> 01:00.790
I was hoping we could spend a little more --

01:04.343 --> 01:05.288
Go!

01:19.923 --> 01:21.920
Why is the CRF assembling this bomb?

01:22.058 --> 01:23.099
What do they have planned?

01:41.613 --> 01:43.657
Oh, my god, I thought you were... Anna.

02:19.144 --> 02:21.858
The surgeons in Estonia got the bullet out.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.752
She's stabilized.

02:24.451 --> 02:26.400
But the internal bleeding was severe.

02:31.449 --> 02:33.300
They put her in a coma.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.009
Until she recovers minimum metabolic function.

02:36.195 --> 02:39.001
48 hours at least, they say.

02:44.118 --> 02:45.110
I'm sorry.

02:46.558 --> 02:48.507
It was Anna Espinosa.

02:50.282 --> 02:51.751
She did this.

02:52.593 --> 02:56.926
Anna has got the bomb.

02:57.159 --> 02:59.345
We didn't stop her.

03:02.664 --> 03:04.517
I said I'm not to be bothered.

03:08.632 --> 03:09.817
I'll be right there.

04:16.616 --> 04:18.276
This is...

04:18.696 --> 04:20.022
classic.

04:20.909 --> 04:23.525
Is this really the only way to get intel on CRF?

04:23.618 --> 04:25.088
You disagree with my methods.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.249
Sloane signed an agreement with Langley.

04:28.340 --> 04:30.670
He's prohibited from engaging with certain operatives.

04:30.765 --> 04:31.975
Sark's on that list.

04:32.115 --> 04:36.163
Sark will only negotiate openly if he feels he's met his intellectual match.

04:36.302 --> 04:38.728
As acting director, I'll take full responsibility.

04:39.522 --> 04:41.660
Four years ago, if I'm not mistaken,

04:41.753 --> 04:44.655
you fooled a small army into thinking they worked for the CIA,

04:44.748 --> 04:47.650
when in fact they worked for you.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.403
How you convinced the U.S. Government

04:49.496 --> 04:53.832
into offering you the real thing is a story I'm dying to hear.

04:54.671 --> 04:58.959
Suffice to say, Arvin, you have my undying admiration.

05:07.419 --> 05:08.842
You recognize those men?

05:10.383 --> 05:13.286
They were going to help you escape our custody in Johannesburg.

05:14.968 --> 05:16.008
Turn the page.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.424
An abject lesson.

05:25.123 --> 05:29.888
This is what we will do to you if you refuse to cooperate.

05:30.636 --> 05:34.349
Now, how do we retrieve the bomb?

05:37.761 --> 05:42.668
The Cadmus Revolutionary Front is run by a man named Ushek San'ko.

05:42.761 --> 05:45.377
We worked together under my last employer.

05:45.423 --> 05:47.991
San'ko will be taking possession of the bomb shortly.

05:48.037 --> 05:48.599
I've got him.

05:48.740 --> 05:52.549
I told M. Vaughn in Johannesburg I would help you infiltrate CRF

05:52.643 --> 05:55.783
and retrieve this bomb from San'ko.

05:56.296 --> 06:00.201
And I promise you, I will. You have my word.

06:00.294 --> 06:01.429
Your word?

06:01.522 --> 06:03.232
Which has a considerably greater value

06:03.603 --> 06:05.790
than when you knew me last.

06:06.163 --> 06:09.351
Incarceration has given me a sense of...

06:09.958 --> 06:11.142
perspective.

06:11.748 --> 06:13.839
Well, I'll consider that.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.902
But first I have a demand.

06:18.192 --> 06:20.761
I've heard from unreliable sources that

06:20.946 --> 06:24.135
Lauren Reed is dead.

06:24.508 --> 06:27.123
Now I've filed numerous requests about her status.

06:27.403 --> 06:29.731
All have gone unanswered.

06:31.134 --> 06:35.659
What I want is to visit her grave.

06:36.593 --> 06:39.353
I want to see her body for myself.

06:44.121 --> 06:45.638
I'll arrange transport.

06:50.313 --> 06:52.547
There's something else.

06:54.978 --> 06:56.447
I heard about Sark.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.249
He didn't give you anything in South Africa.

06:58.342 --> 06:59.860
No, he was onto us from the beginning.

07:00.513 --> 07:01.746
They're questioning him now.

07:02.071 --> 07:05.117
If Sark can give us intel on how to stop the CRF, we still have a chance.

07:05.210 --> 07:06.443
We can't depend on Sark.

07:06.862 --> 07:08.524
I understand he's cutting a deal.

07:09.785 --> 07:11.255
Look, I don't like it any more than you do,

07:11.394 --> 07:13.199
but if listening to him helps us get the bomb back,

07:13.291 --> 07:14.333
I can live with it.

07:14.519 --> 07:15.798
Even if you're right,

07:17.013 --> 07:18.626
what if Anna gets away?

07:20.636 --> 07:24.113
Sark has agreed to lead us to Ushek San'ko, the leader of CRF.

07:24.206 --> 07:26.822
We believe San'ko can provide operational intelligence

07:26.869 --> 07:29.198
that will allow us to stop Anna and recover the weapon.

07:29.291 --> 07:30.142
When do we leave?

07:30.186 --> 07:31.891
He has, however, made a demand

07:32.058 --> 07:33.904
which involves you.

07:35.743 --> 07:38.990
He wants to exhume your wife's body.

07:43.599 --> 07:45.115
Fine. Let him.

07:45.957 --> 07:46.806
That's not all.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.874
Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.

07:51.014 --> 07:52.245
N o.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.522
Agent Vaughn?

07:53.616 --> 07:54.445
You can't order him too this.

07:54.491 --> 07:56.582
I'm not ordering. I'm asking.

07:57.377 --> 08:00.708
Sark's participation in leading us to CRF, stopping Anna is dependent --

08:00.754 --> 08:02.462
I'll do it.

08:56.344 --> 08:57.862
This is where you keep her?

08:59.218 --> 09:00.258
For national security reasons,

09:00.350 --> 09:02.154
some bodies aren't allowed a public grave.

09:04.116 --> 09:07.163
In this case, we didn't want Lauren's death to become public knowledge.

09:24.042 --> 09:26.659
This  make you feel better, watching this happen?

09:26.799 --> 09:28.507
It gives me hope.

09:29.189 --> 09:31.804
That I can still achieve closure.

09:35.824 --> 09:38.087
Guys like you don't believe in closure.

09:38.319 --> 09:40.791
That would actually require you to care about something.

09:41.397 --> 09:43.011
Perhaps that's true.

09:43.992 --> 09:47.324
Perhaps all I can hope for is a moment for us all to share --

09:47.556 --> 09:49.122
you, me...

09:49.822 --> 09:50.433
her.

09:52.209 --> 09:54.490
And letting go of all pretext and subterfuge,

09:54.537 --> 09:56.436
we can finally admit the truth.

09:57.418 --> 09:59.365
Your wife loved me.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.438
Not even death can change that.

10:04.634 --> 10:06.868
Do it. Open it.

10:10.702 --> 10:13.604
You want your moment? Take it.

10:42.172 --> 10:42.974
Stop.

10:46.011 --> 10:49.342
My agreement, Mr. Vaughn, allows for this.

11:13.936 --> 11:15.883
In a perfect triangular pattern.

11:18.081 --> 11:20.027
Consistent with CIA training.

11:29.470 --> 11:30.845
It was you.

11:33.135 --> 11:34.366
You did this.

11:34.786 --> 11:36.447
Yes, I did.

12:11.324 --> 12:12.746
I'll take you to CRF.

12:17.047 --> 12:18.947
But I want you to face what you did.

12:21.751 --> 12:22.983
I want you to look at her.

12:54.915 --> 12:57.627
Do a search for black widow. It was one of Anna's call signs.

12:57.674 --> 12:59.621
Who knows? She might still use it.

12:59.900 --> 13:03.041
Dixon, will you call me if you find anything? Okay.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.023
Is there anything you need?

13:10.629 --> 13:11.288
No.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.828
You shouldn't blame yourself, Sydney.

13:20.556 --> 13:24.222
I certainly don't hold you responsible for what happened to Nadia.

13:25.483 --> 13:27.288
I've said this before.

13:27.754 --> 13:29.415
Anna won't kill Nadia.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.470
She can't.

13:32.780 --> 13:36.060
After all this, you still believe.

13:36.530 --> 13:37.800
Sydney.

13:38.744 --> 13:42.649
My daughter lies there in a medically induced coma.

13:44.192 --> 13:48.096
What else do I have but my faith?

13:53.940 --> 13:56.701
All patients and personnel, please remain calm.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.312
We have experienced a small fire in the sub-basement.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.164
Please proceed to the nearest exit in an orderly manner.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.727
Should be a security detail in the building.

14:03.821 --> 14:05.531
Stay with Nadia until they get here.

15:19.801 --> 15:20.841
Nadia's next door.

15:22.102 --> 15:25.579
I thought it prudent to change her room until our extraction arrived.

15:33.107 --> 15:34.530
The doctors at the hospital assured me

15:34.623 --> 15:36.954
Nadia will be able to complete her recovery here.

15:41.209 --> 15:43.951
Anna came after us, Jack, in a public place.

15:44.042 --> 15:45.846
The operative question is, why?

15:45.939 --> 15:47.887
Anna has the bomb. Why come back for Nadia?

15:47.981 --> 15:49.737
I don't care about her agenda.

15:49.829 --> 15:51.968
That woman is a threat. I want her destroyed.

15:52.108 --> 15:54.437
Your daughter has just been attacked. I understand that.

15:54.859 --> 15:57.474
But this is not the time to react emotionally.

15:57.566 --> 15:58.989
Whatever it takes,

15:59.362 --> 16:00.833
you find Anna.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.038
Whatever corners you have to cut,

16:04.177 --> 16:06.076
whatever favors you have to call in,

16:06.123 --> 16:07.020
do it.

16:07.345 --> 16:10.488
But find her. Eliminate her.

16:11.702 --> 16:14.940
And what about your faith that Nadia will survive?

16:15.593 --> 16:19.975
Oh... this isn't about faith.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.710
Well, it took me a while to patch into the security system in Estonia.

16:26.803 --> 16:30.022
The -- mm -- firewall was a piece of cake,

16:30.115 --> 16:33.448
but the CCTV was rigged with a fluctuating log-on, and --

16:34.598 --> 16:36.402
you don't really care about --

16:37.103 --> 16:39.479
point is, I did manage to hack in.

16:39.525 --> 16:40.852
By the way, is it just me,

16:40.946 --> 16:43.322
or does fast forward make you a little nauseated?

16:43.415 --> 16:44.359
Do we have audio?

16:44.452 --> 16:45.685
All we have is raw video feed,

16:45.823 --> 16:49.109
but fortunately I wrote a voice reconstruction program

16:49.247 --> 16:52.962
based on a lip movements a few years ago, and check this out.

16:54.130 --> 16:56.268
Why is CRF assembling assembling this bomb?

16:56.361 --> 16:57.880
What do they have planned?

17:00.963 --> 17:01.958
What did he say?

17:02.049 --> 17:03.997
Well, that I couldn't rebuild.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.320
But look at this.

17:06.444 --> 17:09.919
You see that shadow right there in the background?

17:10.011 --> 17:13.679
Well, I enhanced the detail, and look at that.

17:14.799 --> 17:17.080
That's why anna came after her in the hospital.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.257
Excuse me?

17:18.816 --> 17:21.623
I don't under-- you're welcome.

17:21.715 --> 17:23.950
Sark gave us the contact protocol to meet with the CRF.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.703
It's a coded message in the classified ads.

17:25.888 --> 17:27.025
If all goes as he says it will,

17:27.117 --> 17:29.353
we should have a response by the evening edition.

17:29.492 --> 17:31.391
And then what? You and I go in alone?

17:31.998 --> 17:34.041
Do you mean is it a glorified date?

17:34.461 --> 17:36.791
That's  not what I meant, but is it?

17:36.930 --> 17:37.973
No, not exactly.

17:38.112 --> 17:39.391
We've got to take Sark with us.

17:39.578 --> 17:41.619
He insists we won't get through the front door without him,

17:41.712 --> 17:44.616
so we rely on the explosive tracking device we put in his neck.

17:44.661 --> 17:46.178
If he tries to burn us in any way --

17:46.598 --> 17:48.401
sabotage, escape, whatever --

17:48.495 --> 17:49.679
We take him out.

17:55.569 --> 17:56.417
Hey.

17:57.866 --> 17:59.288
Nadia's gonna make it.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.511
You're monitoring agent Santos' progress.

18:11.837 --> 18:15.122
If she were to be awakened from her coma early,

18:15.682 --> 18:17.438
what risks would she be exposed to?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.354
It would increase stress on her circulatory system.

18:20.961 --> 18:23.622
The quicker you revive her, the higher the risk of shock,

18:23.715 --> 18:25.281
heart attack, stroke.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.081
Is there some reason to wake her?

18:27.922 --> 18:29.296
Not yet.

18:34.766 --> 18:36.952
The man we're meeting with, Ushek San'ko --

18:37.044 --> 18:38.466
what else can you tell us about him?

18:40.288 --> 18:43.668
San'ko's expertise is coordinating terrorist activities.

18:43.714 --> 18:45.757
And you're convinced he'll know where the bomb is?

18:45.895 --> 18:48.464
I'm quite certain he's the one that tasked Anna to get it.

18:48.977 --> 18:53.216
Per our protocol, he took out a series of ads in response to mine.

18:53.310 --> 18:54.349
This one here --

18:54.442 --> 18:57.727
it says I'm to meet him at a club in Venice where we've done business before.

18:57.819 --> 18:58.907
He says I'm to come alone.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.705
Alone?

18:59.798 --> 19:01.030
That's interesting.

19:01.263 --> 19:04.832
I gave you my word, Mr. Vaughn. Am I to take it you don't trust me?

19:04.925 --> 19:07.206
You're about to betray one of your former partners.

19:07.486 --> 19:09.863
Doesn't really instill faith in your loyalty.

19:09.956 --> 19:13.671
My past infidelities are just that -- mistakes I've learned from.

19:13.763 --> 19:15.280
Repented for.

19:15.559 --> 19:17.125
I've become a trustworthy man.

19:17.265 --> 19:20.167
Well, the answer's no. Where you go, we go.

19:25.589 --> 19:26.820
Lauren and I --

19:26.913 --> 19:30.435
we set up a weapons deal with San'ko before the Covenant imploded.

19:31.088 --> 19:33.751
The thing is, is he's never met her face to face.

19:33.938 --> 19:35.885
All he knows is her voice.

20:28.948 --> 20:30.130
How's this?

20:31.860 --> 20:32.708
Perfect.

20:58.611 --> 21:00.559
I must tell you,

21:01.025 --> 21:03.402
Lauren and I had a reputation.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.674
Certain intimacies were public knowledge.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.571
We must maintain appearances.

21:08.664 --> 21:10.993
Dream on, you perverted freak.

21:11.273 --> 21:14.367
Oh. Mr. Sark.

21:14.833 --> 21:17.066
San'ko. It's good to see you.

21:17.579 --> 21:19.335
And you must be...

21:19.522 --> 21:21.088
Lauren Reed, mm?

21:21.928 --> 21:25.308
My dear, what a pleasure to meet you after so long.

21:26.757 --> 21:30.471
The pleasure's all mine -- obviously.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.304
So, let us toast.

21:35.426 --> 21:37.039
To CRF, mm?

21:45.453 --> 21:46.447
Salud.

21:52.991 --> 21:54.270
Ahh!

22:00.299 --> 22:01.292
So...

22:03.068 --> 22:05.110
what is the nature of your business?

22:05.203 --> 22:06.673
You represent certain interests

22:06.765 --> 22:09.314
that stand to profit should the market fall.

22:10.157 --> 22:12.771
If you were to provide us with some insider information,

22:12.892 --> 22:15.556
we would be happy to split the profits.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.539
How nice of you.

22:17.865 --> 22:20.576
Information about what?

22:21.416 --> 22:24.414
Our sources tell us you've just acquired a chemical bomb.

22:24.693 --> 22:26.115
What do you intended to do with it?

22:26.816 --> 22:28.429
Which weapon are you talking about?

22:28.614 --> 22:33.141
The one you hired Anna Espinosa to steal.

22:34.448 --> 22:37.161
Obviously you've never heard of her. Sorry to waste your time.

22:37.252 --> 22:39.010
You want something from me?

22:39.803 --> 22:42.896
I want something from you, my dear.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.642
And what is that?

22:45.715 --> 22:48.761
Mr. Sark has told me about your...

22:49.694 --> 22:51.403
predilections.

22:51.542 --> 22:54.396
Mm? I have a room above this club.

22:55.610 --> 22:57.510
I'd like to watch that.

22:58.256 --> 22:59.631
For myself.

23:01.687 --> 23:04.064
You have my permission to kill him if you'd like.

23:04.439 --> 23:10.062
I'm sure Julian's told you that we never mix business with pleasure.

23:31.099 --> 23:32.711
I told you she was special.

23:32.897 --> 23:36.946
Oh, yes. She is indeed special.

23:50.737 --> 23:51.395
Anna!

23:51.703 --> 23:52.457
Above us.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.316
I'll take the lead. We'll cover each other's corners.

23:56.576 --> 23:58.095
Give me a gun. I can help.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.371
Stay here and shut up.

24:23.682 --> 24:25.821
Let's get Sark. We might still be able to cut her off.

24:58.219 --> 24:59.020
What is it?

24:59.113 --> 25:00.727
There's an explosive device in your neck.

25:00.819 --> 25:02.098
Wait, how do you know that?

25:02.190 --> 25:04.233
There's no time for painkillers. Hold him down.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.024
Don't move.

25:08.079 --> 25:08.832
Please --

25:09.440 --> 25:11.766
Oh, God.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.899
Syd, we have to blow the tracking device.

25:16.039 --> 25:16.889
Vaughn, wait a second.

25:16.982 --> 25:17.764
No, it's our backup protocol.

25:17.857 --> 25:19.565
No, no, no, wait. He might lead us to Anna.

25:19.704 --> 25:20.602
No, he's out of our custody.

25:20.675 --> 25:22.717
We  can't take that chance. We have to blow it now.

25:28.327 --> 25:29.701
What happened?

25:30.354 --> 25:31.012
It failed.

25:34.330 --> 25:35.897
Anna Aspinosa.

25:36.456 --> 25:38.405
Julian Sark.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.326
It's nice to meet you.

25:47.868 --> 25:49.291
We played right into her hands.

25:49.384 --> 25:50.759
Anna killed San'ko in front of our eyes

25:50.852 --> 25:52.733
and then distracted us long enough to grab Sark.

25:52.826 --> 25:53.915
You couldn't have predicted this.

25:54.007 --> 25:57.244
We had no intelligence indicating the two shared a history or an agenda.

25:57.337 --> 25:59.332
Still, I should have considered it s a possibility.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.508
We need to focus on where Anna and Sark are headed with the bomb.

26:02.647 --> 26:05.053
Contact all your sources. See if anyone has heard anything.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.139
I'll check back on the hour.

26:06.231 --> 26:06.842
Good.

26:12.357 --> 26:14.496
A.P.O. is monitoring traffic.

26:14.682 --> 26:16.486
We've called in every favor we can

26:16.579 --> 26:19.291
to get Sark and Anna on different intelligence radars.

26:19.897 --> 26:21.654
Considering the destructive capacity

26:21.747 --> 26:23.408
of the bomb they have in their possession,

26:23.547 --> 26:26.449
they're going to take extra precaution in covering their tracks.

26:26.543 --> 26:29.063
At this point, we'll take anything we can get.

28:12.535 --> 28:13.383
Not hungry?

28:14.551 --> 28:19.696
I thought after a year in a maximum security prison that

28:19.882 --> 28:23.597
you would appreciate a decent meal.

28:25.464 --> 28:28.510
Beware a summit that begins with shared bread.

28:28.603 --> 28:32.125
The sated man is at his weakest.

28:32.592 --> 28:34.014
Who said that?

28:34.154 --> 28:37.150
A vietnamese general I had dinner with once.

28:37.429 --> 28:40.522
By dessert, I had put a bullet between his eyes.

28:54.313 --> 28:56.068
I appreciate the rescue.

28:57.377 --> 28:59.418
I assume there's a price.

28:59.744 --> 29:02.693
When I heard of a young man

29:03.515 --> 29:09.043
so ruthless in his shifting allegiances that he killed his own father,

29:09.603 --> 29:13.411
I thought, this is a man I am fated to work with.

29:18.085 --> 29:21.272
My aim tonight was Ushek San'ko's head.

29:21.365 --> 29:25.318
CRF is a weak organization.

29:25.410 --> 29:26.498
No vision.

29:26.824 --> 29:29.964
Considering the power of the bomb I stole for them,

29:30.011 --> 29:31.671
they did not pay me nearly enough.

29:32.791 --> 29:35.503
So you decided to go into business for yourself.

29:35.596 --> 29:37.447
I thought it an appropriate time.

29:38.848 --> 29:40.700
And then I spotted you in the club.

29:40.794 --> 29:42.216
And you saw your opportunity.

29:42.308 --> 29:43.301
Yes.

29:48.115 --> 29:49.250
Partnership.

29:51.026 --> 29:53.355
My brains, your skills.

29:53.447 --> 29:56.253
You flatter yourself, but something like that.

29:57.281 --> 29:58.608
I must tell you,

29:58.747 --> 30:01.600
selling a bomb on the black market can be tricky.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.772
I already have a buyer in mind

30:04.912 --> 30:06.908
right here in this very city.

30:07.233 --> 30:08.799
Michel Guinot.

30:08.893 --> 30:11.986
A man with whom I have an excellent credit rating.

30:12.219 --> 30:15.311
Yes, Mr. Sark. I know you do.

30:28.866 --> 30:31.625
Anna's selling the bomb to a man named Michel Guinot.

30:31.766 --> 30:34.714
Gateway of all arms sales in and out of central Russia.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.734
Guinot's on the watch list. We have satellite surveillance.

30:36.873 --> 30:38.343
Where'd the intel come from?

30:38.745 --> 30:40.596
Classified, but reliable.

30:40.735 --> 30:43.159
Your mission is to intercept the bomb, detain the principals.

30:43.252 --> 30:45.773
Do we have a confirmed location for the meet with Anna and Sark?

30:45.958 --> 30:47.793
Guinot's on the move to a property he owns --

30:47.885 --> 30:49.546
a graveyard. He's been known to hold meets there.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.727
Marshall's sending coordinates.

30:50.820 --> 30:52.749
If this exchange goes through, Sydney,

30:52.842 --> 30:54.311
both Anna and Sark will be in the wind.

30:54.451 --> 30:57.495
We may never have this opportunity again.

31:02.081 --> 31:05.069
We called as soon as there was any change.

31:08.295 --> 31:10.481
- When did she wake up?
- A few minutes ago.

31:10.573 --> 31:12.330
But she's fine. Out of the woods.

31:16.022 --> 31:16.870
Thank you.

31:17.337 --> 31:19.809
There was an irregularity we thought you should see.

31:19.949 --> 31:23.709
Deloxin is a drug we use to wean patients out of medically induced comas.

31:24.063 --> 31:27.012
Your daughter had four times the amount we normally use.

31:27.993 --> 31:30.465
Mr. Sloane, Nadia didn't just wake up.

31:31.211 --> 31:35.164
Someone did this to her, and I believe I know who it is.

32:06.515 --> 32:08.516
About 14 hours.

32:08.610 --> 32:12.323
Miss Espinosa was kind enough to set me free.

32:15.688 --> 32:17.806
She came here with me, didn't she?

32:18.272 --> 32:19.839
Mademoiselle Espinosa,

32:21.053 --> 32:23.525
as the buyer, I dictate certain terms,

32:23.664 --> 32:26.183
starting with good faith on your part.

32:26.512 --> 32:29.317
Put your weapon on the stone, please.

32:42.829 --> 32:43.820
It's very nice.

32:45.409 --> 32:46.114
Let's go.

32:51.538 --> 32:55.185
Is the device acceptable to you, monsieur Guinot?

32:55.277 --> 32:56.414
It is.

32:56.974 --> 33:00.543
And the price -- is that acceptable also?

33:13.211 --> 33:15.111
Give me 10 seconds.

33:18.008 --> 33:19.859
The transfer is almost complete.

33:24.766 --> 33:25.236
Go.

33:35.195 --> 33:36.807
You get Sark. I'll go after the bomb.

34:20.148 --> 34:21.284
What are you doing?!

34:22.545 --> 34:23.632
Sydney!

34:24.708 --> 34:26.129
I'm a man of my word.

34:27.905 --> 34:29.757
I will kill you.

34:29.942 --> 34:30.936
You bastard!

35:22.158 --> 35:26.302
The United States government has some questions for you.

35:54.822 --> 35:55.862
We caught her.

35:58.245 --> 35:58.951
Yes, we did.

36:02.644 --> 36:03.587
Sark.

36:04.007 --> 36:05.239
We'll get him back.

36:13.508 --> 36:20.500
Now most people attribute the words "abra cadabra" to Houdini.

36:20.594 --> 36:22.589
That's not actually the case. What --

36:23.054 --> 36:25.767
Whoa. Okay.

36:26.141 --> 36:29.711
Okay. That was not supposed to happen.

36:30.692 --> 36:33.164
You know what? Keep 'em.

36:34.613 --> 36:35.701
Can I come in?

36:35.840 --> 36:37.502
Hey. Yeah. Sure.

36:38.604 --> 36:41.935
I'll be out in the hallway entertaining sick people if you need me.

36:42.449 --> 36:43.156
Hey.

36:50.682 --> 36:51.847
Cómo estas?

36:51.985 --> 36:52.929
I'm good.

36:54.706 --> 36:56.320
- You?
- Better.

36:58.889 --> 37:02.222
- So you got her?
- Mm-hmm.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.188
And the bomb?

37:05.374 --> 37:07.350
Yeah, we got that, too.

37:11.511 --> 37:14.604
And, hey, we didn't kill each other.

37:16.034 --> 37:16.691
Nope.

37:32.122 --> 37:34.594
My closing report as acting director.

37:35.155 --> 37:36.721
The job's yours again.

37:37.841 --> 37:39.502
Nadia is out of her coma.

37:40.950 --> 37:42.754
Thank god she pulled through.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.680
God had nothing to do with it.

37:46.614 --> 37:49.039
Her medical chart indicates that someone injected her

37:49.177 --> 37:51.650
with a counter agent in order to wake her up.

37:53.612 --> 37:54.844
As a professional courtesy,

37:54.937 --> 37:56.980
I would like you to justify your decision.

38:02.731 --> 38:06.635
Your words -- do whatever it takes to stop Anna.

38:06.915 --> 38:08.193
We stopped Anna.

38:08.472 --> 38:11.184
You also indicated that this wasn't Nadia's time,

38:11.325 --> 38:12.680
that she would pull through.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.322
Don't tell me you're losing your faith.

38:18.732 --> 38:21.874
When I stepped down as director of this task force,

38:22.013 --> 38:24.057
you had full discretion.

38:24.990 --> 38:29.277
I'm not going to argue with your choice because the mission was a success.

38:29.603 --> 38:31.980
But I would have appreciated as a father

38:32.073 --> 38:37.554
to be apprised of your decision to put my daughter's life at risk.

38:37.647 --> 38:40.549
As you do mine every day.

38:41.437 --> 38:44.292
When I accepted this position, I made two agreements --

38:44.384 --> 38:46.474
one with Langley and one with you.

38:46.567 --> 38:47.846
A pact.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.122
That's still in effect.

38:51.148 --> 38:53.907
But only because my daughter is unhurt.

38:54.420 --> 38:55.938
I wonder, Jack,

38:57.012 --> 39:02.158
what assurances I have that you will continue to honor it.
