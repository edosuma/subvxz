WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:04.871
Bruni:
AND YOU JUST TELL THEM TO GO
AWAY, THOUGH, AND THEY GO AWAY?

00:04.906 --> 00:08.474
THE SCARY ONES,
THEY NEVER, EVER GO AWAY.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.641
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:10.676 --> 00:12.843
THEIR FATHER PASSED AWAY.

00:12.878 --> 00:14.948
I SAW THE BLACK SILHOUETTE
OF SOMETHING SITTING.

00:14.983 --> 00:16.533
YOU SAW AN APPARITION
SITTING HERE?

00:16.568 --> 00:18.084
SOMETHING MOVING
IN THE KID'S ROOM?

00:18.119 --> 00:19.450
THAT IS THE KID'S ROOM.

00:19.485 --> 00:21.654
HE'S TALKING ABOUT SEEING
A SHADOW FIGURE AT NIGHT.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.624
- [ GASPS ]
- OH ****

00:27.126 --> 00:28.893
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:28.928 --> 00:31.329
AND I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.397
WE'VE SPENT
A COMBINED 30 YEARS

00:33.432 --> 00:37.036
INVESTIGATING THE WORLD'S
MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.670
AFTER THOUSANDS OF CASES,

00:38.705 --> 00:41.940
WE ARE READY FOR OUR
MOST IMPORTANT JOURNEY YET.

00:41.941 --> 00:43.842
[ BOTH GASP ]

00:43.877 --> 00:48.014
RESCUING FAMILIES TERRORIZED
BY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

00:48.049 --> 00:50.882
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.753
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH
BEHIND THE HAUNTING

00:53.788 --> 00:56.589
TO HELP FAMILIES
RECLAIM THEIR HOMES...

00:56.624 --> 00:57.589
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.557
...AND THEIR LIVES.

00:59.592 --> 01:02.629
CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS

01:08.834 --> 01:11.637
SO THIS CASE IS KIND OF
INTERESTING IN THAT IT'S, LIKE,

01:11.672 --> 01:13.656
AN OLD TENEMENT HOUSE,
YOU KNOW, NEW ENGLAND STYLE

01:13.691 --> 01:15.641
WHERE IT'S, LIKE, APARTMENT,
APARTMENT, APARTMENT.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.575
IT WAS BUILT IN 1924.
- OKAY.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.713
SO THE ONES WHO CALLED US
ARE SHANNON AND REBEKKA.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.780
THEY ARE SISTERS.
THEY'RE ALL RELATED.

01:22.815 --> 01:25.084
BUT, LIKE, BOTTOM FLOOR
IS THE GRANDMOTHER.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.651
NEXT UP IS SHANNON,
HER SON.

01:27.686 --> 01:30.756
AND THEN THE TOP FLOOR
IS REBEKKA AND HER SON.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.191
IT SOUNDS HUGE, THOUGH.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.926
- IT'S REALLY BIG.
- OKAY.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.995
THEIR FATHER PASSED AWAY

01:36.030 --> 01:38.030
LIKE 13, 14 YEARS AGO.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.164
DID THE FATHER DIE
IN THE HOUSE, THOUGH?

01:39.199 --> 01:40.398
- NO. NO.
- NO?

01:40.433 --> 01:42.985
THEY SEEM TO THINK
A LOT OF THE ACTIVITY IS HIM.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.538
BUT SOME OF IT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE IT COULD BE HIM.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.405
THEY'VE HAD THINGS THROWN
IN THE HOUSE.

01:47.406 --> 01:49.073
THEY HEAR FOOTSTEPS UPSTAIRS.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.175
THEY ARE SO FRIGHTENED,
AT THIS POINT,

01:51.210 --> 01:54.512
THAT THEY'RE NOT EVEN
GOING INTO CERTAIN ROOMS.

01:54.547 --> 01:58.084
I REALLY WANNA SEE REBEKKA MOVE
INTO THE REST OF HER HOUSE.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.183
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

01:59.218 --> 02:01.120
I REALLY WANNA
MAKE SURE THE KID'S OKAY.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.153
YEAH.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.690
AND I'D LIKE
TO GIVE THEM SOME ANSWERS

02:03.725 --> 02:05.191
AS TO WHO'S THERE.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.266
Berry: YOU KNOW,
THIS FAMILY'S REALLY TERRIFIED.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.103
THEY ARE REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE,
YOU KNOW, LIVING IN THEIR HOUSE.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.270
Bruni:
THAT IS A VERY BIG HOUSE.

02:20.305 --> 02:21.641
Berry: YOU SAID THEY HAVE
THREE APARTMENTS IN THERE?

02:21.676 --> 02:23.208
THREE
INDIVIDUAL APARTMENTS.

02:23.243 --> 02:24.542
THIS BUILDING IS HUGE.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.712
THERE ARE THREE APARTMENTS,
THREE DIFFERENT FAMILIES.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.046
- HI.
- HOW ARE YOU?

02:28.081 --> 02:30.416
- I'M REBEKKA.
- I'M AMY. GOOD TO MEET YOU.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.450
- SHANNON. NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HI.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.184
- HI, HI.
- HI. SHANNON.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.718
NICE TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

02:34.753 --> 02:36.488
Bruni: LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.623
SHALL WE?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.358
THE GRANDMOTHER LIVES
ON THE FIRST FLOOR,

02:40.393 --> 02:43.730
SHANNON ON THE SECOND,
AND REBEKKA ON THE THIRD.

02:43.765 --> 02:45.029
WE HAVE OUR WORK
CUT OUT FOR US

02:45.064 --> 02:46.697
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF GROUND
TO COVER

02:46.698 --> 02:48.432
AND A LOT OF MONITORING
TO DO.

02:48.467 --> 02:50.569
SO THIS HERE'S
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.671
PARDON THE MESS.
WE'RE RENOVATING SOON.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.138
SO WE'RE KINDA
BOXING UP AS WE GO.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.275
OH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
SO HOW LONG HAS YOUR GRANDMOTHER

02:56.310 --> 02:57.675
LIVED IN THIS AREA?

02:57.710 --> 02:59.612
UM, SHE BOUGHT
THIS HOUSE IN 1982.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.845
SHE'S BEEN HERE SINCE.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.180
SHE'S ALWAYS LIVED
ON THIS LEVEL?

03:02.181 --> 03:04.015
YES, ALWAYS ON THIS LEVEL,
SPECIFICALLY.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.852
AND SO, I MEAN, HAVE YOU
HAD ACTIVITY IN HERE?

03:06.887 --> 03:09.019
NOTHING EVER
REALLY HAPPENS IN HERE.

03:09.054 --> 03:12.858
OKAY. SO WE'LL PROBABLY
FOCUS ON THE UPPER FLOORS.

03:12.893 --> 03:16.563
SO I GUESS WE CAN MOVE ON.

03:16.598 --> 03:20.050
NOW WE'LL GO
TO MY APARTMENT.

03:20.085 --> 03:23.467
SO THIS IS
MY LIVING ROOM HERE.

03:23.502 --> 03:25.521
HAVE YOU HAD EXPERIENCES
IN THIS ROOM?

03:25.556 --> 03:28.082
UM, KNOCKING
ON THE DOOR THERE, YES...

03:28.117 --> 03:30.609
A COUPLE TIMES.
- AND SO YOU OPEN IT

03:30.610 --> 03:31.844
AND THERE'S NOBODY THERE,
OBVIOUSLY.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.862
- NEVER.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:32.897 --> 03:33.811
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.047
WELL, LET'S GO ON
AND HEAD IN HERE.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.615
OKAY.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.683
THIS IS MY KITCHEN.
- OKAY.

03:39.718 --> 03:42.287
UM, THERE'S BEEN
ACTIVITY IN HERE.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.356
I HAVE A SLOTTED SPOON,
UH, LIKE WE USE,

03:44.391 --> 03:45.657
LIKE, FOR OUR RICE.

03:45.692 --> 03:48.744
AND THE SPOON FLEW
OUT OF THE DISH RACK,

03:48.779 --> 03:51.797
HIT THE WALL,
AND FELL TO THE FLOOR.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.297
THERE WERE DISHES HERE,
YEAH?

03:53.332 --> 03:55.968
I HAD A COUPLE SAUCE POTS
UP ABOUT THIS HIGH OR SO.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.537
- UH-HUH.
- AND I HAD THE SPOON IN HERE.

03:57.572 --> 03:59.036
LIKE, IN BETWEEN
THE SAUCE POTS, KINDA?

03:59.071 --> 04:00.640
YEAH, IT WAS KINDA, LIKE, STUCK
IN THERE, YOU KNOW?

04:00.675 --> 04:01.606
YEAH, YEAH.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.460
IT'S JUST
AN UNSETTLING FEELING.

04:04.495 --> 04:07.138
BUT THE NOT KNOWING
IS WHAT IRKS ME.

04:07.173 --> 04:09.781
- ALL RIGHT. SO, THE THIRD FLOOR.
- YES.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.882
- NOW, WHO LIVES UP HERE?
- I LIVE UP HERE.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.285
THIS IS MY APARTMENT.
- ALL RIGHT.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.654
AND YOU LIVE HERE
WITH YOUR SON?

04:14.689 --> 04:15.719
- MY SON.
- OKAY.

04:15.754 --> 04:16.822
SO JUST
THE TWO OF YOU UP HERE?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.089
- YEP.
- ALL RIGHT.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.892
I NOTICE
THERE'S NO FURNITURE.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.625
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- YES, UM...

04:21.661 --> 04:22.929
THIS ROOM MAKES ME
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

04:22.964 --> 04:23.996
- THIS ROOM DOES?
- YES. MM-HMM.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.896
- HAS IT ALWAYS?
- ALWAYS.

04:25.931 --> 04:27.933
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN UP HERE EVER?

04:27.968 --> 04:30.937
THERE WAS A FIGURE
SITTING ON A COUCH

04:30.972 --> 04:33.871
AGAINST THAT WALL
THAT WAS OVER THERE

04:33.906 --> 04:36.642
AND THE FOOTSTEPS
IN THE ATTIC CONTINUOUSLY.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.643
AND YOU HAVE ACCESS
TO THE ATTIC?

04:37.678 --> 04:38.676
- YES.
- OKAY.

04:38.677 --> 04:40.179
OH, GOOD.
SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR ADAM.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.446
AHA, NO.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.281
SO YOU WON'T EVEN GO
INTO THIS SPACE, REALLY?

04:44.316 --> 04:46.719
NO. I MEAN, IF I HAVE TO,
IF I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO,

04:46.754 --> 04:48.087
YOU KNOW, CLEANING
OR SOMETHING, I WILL.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.386
BUT I DON'T CHOOSE
TO HANG OUT IN HERE.

04:49.421 --> 04:51.623
I DON'T LIKE TO BE IN HERE.
MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.293
THIS WOULD TECHNICALLY
BE THE DINING ROOM.

04:53.328 --> 04:54.593
BUT I ALSO DON'T
LIKE TO BE IN HERE.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.827
MY SON LIKES TO BE IN HERE.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.097
HE PLAYS WITH HIS TABLET
AT THIS LITTLE PLUG RIGHT THERE.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.032
SO YOU DON'T
LIKE THIS ROOM EITHER?

05:01.033 --> 05:04.570
I JUST, I -- I CHOOSE NOT
TO HANG OUT IN THESE ROOMS.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.838
- SO YOU LIVE IN THIS BIG SPACE.
- MM-HMM.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.709
BUT, LIKE, A BIG PORTION
OF THE SPACE, YOU WON'T USE.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.542
YEAH. SO THE THINGS
THAT HAVE OCCURRED

05:11.577 --> 05:13.312
THAT HAVE MADE YOU FREAK OUT
ABOUT THIS SPACE

05:13.347 --> 05:14.845
IS YOU SAW AN APPARITION.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.717
I SAW THE BLACK SILHOUETTE
OF SOMETHING SITTING.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.984
SITTING HERE?

05:20.019 --> 05:21.354
- I WALKED THROUGH...
- I WAS HERE WHEN IT HAPPENED.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.440
...AND I GOT TO ABOUT,
LIKE, THIS ANGLE.

05:23.475 --> 05:25.456
WAS IT, LIKE...
COULD YOU TELL FEATURES,

05:25.491 --> 05:27.359
OR WAS IT JUST A SHADOW?
- IT WAS LIKE A SILHOUETTE.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.759
- OKAY. YEAH, YEAH.
- AND SO, YOU --

05:28.794 --> 05:31.163
DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT
PERSON WAS, OR DO YOU JUST...?

05:31.198 --> 05:32.396
UM, THE POSITION
IT WAS SITTING IN,

05:32.431 --> 05:34.300
I WOULD SAY, JUST
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD,

05:34.335 --> 05:35.399
POSSIBLY MY FATHER...
- YEAH.

05:35.434 --> 05:37.069
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
HE WOULD SIT ON THE COUCH.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.838
- WHAT WAS HIS REAL NAME?
- JERRY.

05:38.873 --> 05:40.837
JEROME.

05:40.872 --> 05:43.308
MAYBE HE WANTED ME
TO SEE HIM.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.844
I DON'T KNOW.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.815
Rebekka:
SO THIS IS NOAH'S ROOM.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.685
HE DOESN'T TYPICALLY
LIKE TO BE IN HERE.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.919
HE'D RATHER BE
IN THE MIDDLE ROOM.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.152
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S BECAUSE

05:55.153 --> 05:56.422
HE'S MORE AFRAID OF THIS ROOM
THAN THAT ROOM.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.888
- MM-HMM.
- HE DOES WAKE UP AT NIGHT

05:57.923 --> 06:01.327
AND TELLS ME THAT HE SEES
SHADOWS IN HIS ROOM A LOT.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.693
I TRY TO TELL HIM,
YOU KNOW, TRY TO MAKE --

06:02.728 --> 06:04.230
BECAUSE HE'S LITTLE,
I TRY TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.

06:04.265 --> 06:05.732
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S NOT REAL, YOU KNOW.

06:05.767 --> 06:07.365
BUT HE'S STILL --
HE'S VERY ADAMANT

06:07.400 --> 06:11.337
ON THAT HE SEES STUFF
IN THIS ROOM ALL THE TIME.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.204
YOU THINK HE'S SCARED?

06:13.239 --> 06:15.707
I MEAN, IS HE SCARED
TO BE IN THE HOUSE?

06:15.708 --> 06:17.643
OH, YEAH. HE WON'T STAY IN HERE
ALONE AT NIGHT.

06:20.045 --> 06:23.349
Bruni: EVERY KID SHOULD
FEEL SAFE IN THEIR OWN ROOM.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.782
I'M A MOTHER MYSELF.

06:24.817 --> 06:27.653
SO TALKING TO CHILDREN
IS PART OF MY DAILY LIFE.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.506
SO I'M GONNA SIT DOWN
WITH NOAH

06:29.541 --> 06:31.650
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET
TO THE BOTTOM

06:31.685 --> 06:33.724
OF WHAT HE'S SEEING
IN HIS ROOM.

06:33.759 --> 06:35.694
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.
- WHAT IS IT?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.194
WHAT IF WE PLAY DINOSAURS?

06:37.229 --> 06:39.196
I DON'T REALLY LIKE
DINOSAURS.

06:39.231 --> 06:40.932
OH, NO! ALL RIGHT. BYE.
SEE YOU LATER.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.969
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I DO <i> KIND OF</i> LIKE DINOSAURS.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.471
WILL YOU PLAY
WITH THEM WITH ME?

06:45.506 --> 06:48.141
OH, DINOSAURS.

06:48.176 --> 06:50.493
WHAT'S THIS ONE?

06:50.528 --> 06:52.776
UH, IT'S A T. REX.

06:52.811 --> 06:55.513
[ GASPS ] T. REX.
HE'S THE SCARIEST ONE, HUH?

06:55.514 --> 06:56.881
YEAH.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.784
I'M NOT SCARED OF HIM.
- YOU'RE NOT SCARED OF HIM?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.720
ARE YOU SCARED OF ANYTHING?
- NO.

07:00.755 --> 07:02.586
BUT YOU'RE NEVER
SCARED IN THIS ROOM?

07:02.621 --> 07:04.388
IS THIS YOUR -- THIS IS YOUR
FAVORITE ROOM TO PLAY IN?

07:04.389 --> 07:05.989
YES.

07:06.024 --> 07:08.926
DO YOU LIKE
SLEEPING IN YOUR ROOM?

07:08.961 --> 07:10.696
COULD WE GET BACK
TO PLAYING DINOSAURS?

07:10.731 --> 07:13.097
OH, YES. WE CAN.
SORRY.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.234
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING
WEIRD IN YOUR ROOM?

07:15.269 --> 07:18.169
- UM, SOMETIMES.
- WHAT?

07:18.170 --> 07:19.539
SHADOWS.

07:21.907 --> 07:23.341
SHADOWS?

07:23.376 --> 07:28.546
SO DO YOU EVER TRY
TO TALK TO THE SHADOWS?

07:28.547 --> 07:30.649
- YES.
- AND WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:30.684 --> 07:32.716
I SAY,
"GET AWAY FROM ME!"

07:32.751 --> 07:34.686
YOU JUST TELL THEM
TO GO AWAY, THOUGH,

07:34.687 --> 07:37.239
AND THEY GO AWAY?

07:37.274 --> 07:39.757
NOT THE SCARY ONES.

07:39.792 --> 07:44.496
THE SCARY ONES,
THEY NEVER, EVER GO AWAY.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.232
IF I SEE ANY SHADOW PEOPLE,
I'M GONNA TELL 'EM,

07:47.267 --> 07:48.966
"THIS IS NOAH'S ROOM.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.837
AND YOU GUYS SHOULD
PROBABLY LET HIM SLEEP."

07:51.872 --> 07:54.673
TALKING TO NOAH REALLY
HEIGHTENED THE URGENCY

07:54.708 --> 07:56.173
OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.176
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON

07:58.211 --> 07:59.477
WITH THESE SHADOWS
IN HIS ROOM.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.381
NOAH'S SAFETY
IS OUR FIRST PRIORITY.

08:05.918 --> 08:08.720
IS THAT CAMERA UP?

08:08.755 --> 08:10.690
- Yes.
- OKAY.

08:20.699 --> 08:22.099
THIS IS AMY AND ADAM

08:22.134 --> 08:26.471
IN THE THIRD-FLOOR APARTMENT
IN NEW BRITAIN, CONNECTICUT,

08:26.506 --> 08:29.073
NIGHT ONE.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.008
YOU SAW US IN HERE EARLIER.

08:31.043 --> 08:35.147
WE WERE INTRODUCED
BY SHANNON AND REBEKKA.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.332
MY NAME IS AMY.

08:37.366 --> 08:39.482
MY NAME IS ADAM.

08:39.484 --> 08:44.689
AND THEY'VE ASKED US
TO GET IN CONTACT WITH YOU,

08:44.724 --> 08:46.959
WHOEVER IS HERE.

08:49.695 --> 08:54.016
WE'RE GONNA START WITH
WHO THEY THINK IS HERE.

08:54.051 --> 08:58.337
AND THAT WOULD BE SOMEONE
NAMED JER, OR JERRY.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.304
THESE GIRLS LOVED YOU
VERY MUCH.

09:00.339 --> 09:03.809
AND THEY WERE SURPRISED
BY YOUR DEATH.

09:03.844 --> 09:07.244
IT SEEMED TO COME
AS A SHOCK TO THEM.

09:07.279 --> 09:11.384
JER, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANNA SAY TO YOUR GIRLS?

09:15.821 --> 09:18.122
ALL RIGHT. LET'S LISTEN.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.690
<i> YOU SAW US IN HERE EARLIER.</i>

09:19.725 --> 09:22.928
<i> WE WERE INTRODUCED
BY SHANNON AND REBEKKA.</i>

09:22.963 --> 09:24.280
<i> MY NAME IS AMY.</i>

09:24.315 --> 09:25.563
<i> MY NAME IS ADAM.</i>

09:25.598 --> 09:28.633
<i> AND THEY'VE ASKED US,
WHOEVER IS HERE,</i>

09:28.634 --> 09:31.570
<i> PARTICULARLY, WE WANNA START
WITH SOME PEOPLE</i>

09:31.605 --> 09:33.005
<i> WHO THEY THINK IS HERE.</i>

09:33.040 --> 09:35.525
IS THAT A CAT?

09:35.560 --> 09:37.975
I DON'T KNOW.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.045
THERE'S SOMETHING MOVING
IN THE WINDOW, RIGHT?

09:41.046 --> 09:42.880
THERE'S SOMETHING
MOVING IN THE WINDOW

09:42.915 --> 09:47.053
IN THE KID'S ROOM.
- THAT IS THE KID'S ROOM.

09:59.398 --> 10:03.469
- IN THE KID'S ROOM?
- THAT IS THE KID'S ROOM.

10:03.504 --> 10:04.735
- Berry: I STILL SEE IT.
- Bruni: YOU DO?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.739
YEAH, IT'S IN THE CORNER.
IT MOVED. LOOK, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

10:06.774 --> 10:07.905
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.541
I MEAN, I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING IN THE ROOM.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.943
BUT I SEE IT
ON THE CAMERA.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.577
CAN YOU SEE IT STILL?

10:13.612 --> 10:16.682
YEAH. IT'S IN
THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.749
I JUST SAW IT.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.619
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO TO THIS SIDE
SO I CAN SEE.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.323
AND YOU CAN SEE RIGHT DOWN
TO THE GARAGE FROM HERE.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.656
IF IT WERE DOWN THERE,
IT WAS THIS TALL.

10:26.691 --> 10:31.630
BUT IT HAS TO BE, LIKE,
AS TALL AS THE GARAGE, RIGHT?

10:31.665 --> 10:34.566
THAT'S WHERE NOAH SAYS
HE SEES A SHADOW FIGURE.

10:34.601 --> 10:38.335
- I KNOW.
- I'M CONCERNED FOR NOAH.

10:38.370 --> 10:41.340
WHAT IF IT'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE
CASTING A SHADOW UP HERE?

10:41.375 --> 10:43.108
IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S
NATURALLY OCCURRING,

10:43.143 --> 10:44.542
WE NEED TO FIND OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:44.543 --> 10:48.414
I'M GONNA GO DOWN THERE
AND WALK AROUND.

10:48.449 --> 10:50.415
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME GO DOWN.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.887
- Check, check.
- CHECK GOOD.

10:56.888 --> 10:59.792
OKAY, WALK IN FRONT
OF THE GARAGE.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.759
I'M WALKING.

11:01.794 --> 11:05.864
WALK AROUND THAT AREA
TO THE RIGHT OF THE VAN.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.900
I'M GOING TO
THE GARAGE DOOR.

11:07.935 --> 11:11.602
COMING BACK.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.705
THERE, RIGHT THERE.
THAT WAS IT.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.524
IT'S PEOPLE.
- GREAT.

11:15.559 --> 11:17.308
RIGHT HERE?
- YEP.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.409
OH, I'M ACTUALLY
KINDA RELIEVED.

11:19.444 --> 11:22.497
ANY TIME ANYONE WALKS
IN FRONT OF THE GARAGE,

11:22.532 --> 11:25.550
IT SHOWED UP ON OUR CAMERA
AS A SHADOW FIGURE.

11:25.585 --> 11:28.286
KIND OF A LETDOWN
BUT NOT BECAUSE, UH,

11:28.287 --> 11:29.619
I DIDN'T REALLY
WANNA THINK OF A --

11:29.654 --> 11:34.093
A SHADOW THING LOOKING IN
NOAH'S WINDOW AT NIGHT.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.926
EVEN THOUGH WE FIGURED OUT
THE SHADOWS,

11:35.961 --> 11:39.064
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OTHER
THINGS GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.733
LET'S DO AN EVP SESSION
IN HERE.

11:43.803 --> 11:47.239
THIS IS AMY AND ADAM.
WE ARE IN NOAH'S ROOM.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.975
IS THERE SOMEONE
IN HERE WITH US?

11:53.646 --> 11:56.980
DO YOU KNOW NOAH?

11:57.015 --> 11:58.348
DO YOU STAY IN THIS ROOM,

11:58.383 --> 12:02.788
OR DO YOU MOVE
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE HOUSE?

12:02.823 --> 12:06.025
DO YOU KNOW WHO JERRY IS?

12:13.665 --> 12:17.236
<i> IS NOAH YOUR FRIEND?
DO YOU TALK TO NOAH AT NIGHT?</i>

12:20.372 --> 12:21.673
"NO."
- YEAH.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.975
"NO," RIGHT?

12:25.978 --> 12:27.644
"NO."

12:27.679 --> 12:29.246
THAT ONE THING...
- IT IS NO.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.816
DO YOU KNOW JERRY? "NO."
- DO YOU KNOW JERRY? "NO."

12:36.889 --> 12:38.807
Bruni: AFTER
WHAT WE EXPERIENCED LAST NIGHT,

12:38.842 --> 12:40.726
WE'RE REALLY GONNA SHIFT
OUR FOCUS FROM LOOKING

12:40.761 --> 12:42.058
FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS

12:42.093 --> 12:46.430
TO LOOKING AT SOME
FORMER OWNERS OF THE HOUSE.

12:46.431 --> 12:48.768
KOTEK FAMILY.

12:53.538 --> 12:56.991
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING OF
YOUR DAD'S IN THE HOUSE STILL,

12:57.026 --> 13:00.445
ANYTHING THAT'S GONNA HELP US
IN TERMS OF TALKING TO HIM

13:00.480 --> 13:01.812
DURING THE INVESTIGATION?

13:01.847 --> 13:06.117
THIS IS MY VERY FIRST BIBLE,
GIVEN TO ME BY HIM.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.253
- WHO IS THIS?
- THIS IS, UH, THE LAST PICTURE

13:08.288 --> 13:10.187
THAT I HAVE OF MY FATHER.
- OH, OKAY.

13:10.222 --> 13:13.123
IT WAS THE LAST CHRISTMAS
WE HAD TOGETHER.

13:13.158 --> 13:15.360
HE WAS A REALLY AWESOME GUY.
HE WAS A VERY FRIENDLY MAN...

13:15.395 --> 13:17.394
- MM-HMM.
- ...A VERY HONEST-WORKING GUY.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.396
I'M KINDA LIKE MY FATHER
WITH, LIKE, A STRONG MENTALITY

13:19.397 --> 13:20.798
WHERE I CAN TAKE CARE
OF EVERYONE.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.335
THAT WAS MY DAD.
HE TOOK CARE OF EVERYONE.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.837
WHILE I WAS A CHI --
VERY SMALL CHILD, UM,

13:25.872 --> 13:27.005
HE WAS A BAPTIST PREACHER.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.439
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.526
- SO HE WAS RELIGIOUS?
- YES, VERY.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.613
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
THAT YOU WOULD SAY

13:34.648 --> 13:36.814
COULD POSSIBLY BE HERE
AND WHY?

13:36.849 --> 13:39.351
GRANDPA WOULD BE THE ONLY OTHER
PERSON I WOULD THINK OF --

13:39.386 --> 13:40.316
MY GRANDFATHER.

13:40.351 --> 13:41.818
- YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S HUSBAND, RIGHT?
- YES.

13:41.853 --> 13:43.354
WHAT IS HIS NAME?

13:43.355 --> 13:44.673
LEO JAMES.

13:44.708 --> 13:45.956
MM-HMM.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.157
- OH, HE WAS AWESOME.
- YEAH?

13:47.192 --> 13:48.726
OH, MY GOD, YEAH.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.226
HE WAS A FREEMASON.

13:50.261 --> 13:52.764
IS THERE ANY EXPERIENCES OR
MEMORIES THAT WE COULD BRING UP

13:52.799 --> 13:55.131
DURING THE INVESTIGATION
THAT MIGHT HELP US?

13:55.166 --> 13:58.704
YEAH, ACTUALLY, HE HAS
A SECRET ROOM IN THE BASEMENT

13:58.739 --> 14:00.170
THAT'S PART OF THE WALL.

14:00.171 --> 14:01.672
IN THIS --
IN THIS BASEMENT.

14:01.707 --> 14:04.026
I KNOW. 'CAUSE HE WAS
A TOOL AND DYE WORKER,

14:04.061 --> 14:06.345
A LOT OF HIS TOOLS AND THINGS
WERE DOWNSTAIRS.

14:06.380 --> 14:07.363
IN THE SECRET ROOM.

14:07.398 --> 14:08.311
IN THAT SPECIAL AREA.

14:08.346 --> 14:10.080
IS IT A ROOM
OR JUST LIKE A CUBBY HOLE?

14:10.115 --> 14:13.318
IT LOOKS LIKE A WALL,
AND THEN YOU JUST TURN
THIS LITTLE PIECE OF WOOD,

14:13.353 --> 14:15.187
AND YOU CAN
GO INSIDE OF IT.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.756
REALLY?

14:16.791 --> 14:18.255
YEAH.

14:18.290 --> 14:21.325
DID YOUR GRANDMOTHER EVER TALK
ABOUT THE ORIGINAL OWNERS?

14:21.326 --> 14:23.526
SHE NEVER MET
THE ORIGINAL OWNER.

14:23.561 --> 14:25.997
AND WHEN SHE BOUGHT IT
FROM THE POLISH COUPLE,

14:26.032 --> 14:28.434
THE WOMAN'S HUSBAND
HAD JUST DIED OR WAS DYING.

14:28.469 --> 14:30.935
SHE DIDN'T REALLY ASK
TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.236
IT WAS A GOOD PRICE.

14:32.271 --> 14:34.839
I GUESS MAYBE THE WIFE
JUST COULDN'T DEAL WITH IT...

14:34.840 --> 14:37.174
...OR WHATEVER. - IN '82, WHEN YOUR
GRANDMOTHER BOUGHT IT? - YEAH.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.145
SO YOUR GRANDMOTHER
NEVER HAD ANY STORIES

14:40.180 --> 14:42.414
ABOUT THE HISTORY
OF THE PROPERTY?

14:42.449 --> 14:43.714
OKAY.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.551
AND, I MEAN,
SHE'LL TELL YOU A LOT THINGS,

14:45.586 --> 14:47.353
SO I WOULD HAVE HEARD SOMETHING
BY NOW.

14:47.388 --> 14:48.451
RIGHT.

14:48.486 --> 14:50.289
DOES SHE HAVE ANY STORIES
THAT SHE EVER TOLD YOU

14:50.324 --> 14:54.092
ABOUT THE HOUSE IN GENERAL,
I GUESS,

14:54.127 --> 14:56.093
IN TERMS OF, LIKE --

14:56.128 --> 14:56.811
THE CEMETERY.

14:56.846 --> 14:57.494
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:57.529 --> 15:01.633
ONE EVENING,
SHE HAD GONE TO HER --

15:01.668 --> 15:03.252
SHE HAD A GARDEN
IN THE BACK.

15:03.287 --> 15:04.802
SHE WENT TO
TAKE THE HOSE IN,

15:04.837 --> 15:07.139
AND WHEN SHE WAS
TAKING IN THE HOSE,

15:07.174 --> 15:09.408
SHE SAW PEOPLE IN THE CEMETERY
IN ROBES.

15:09.443 --> 15:11.343
AND THEY HAD TORCHES.
AND IT SCARED HER.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.912
AND SHE WASN'T SURE
IF IT WAS SATANISTS

15:12.947 --> 15:14.764
OR, YOU KNOW,
WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN.

15:14.799 --> 15:16.546
SO SHE WENT
AND CALLED MY GRANDFATHER

15:16.581 --> 15:18.950
AND SAID, "HEY" -- 'CAUSE WE
WERE LIVING ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

15:18.985 --> 15:21.620
AND SHE SAID, "HEY, THERE'S
SOME PEOPLE IN THE CEMETERY

15:21.655 --> 15:23.087
WEARING ROBES,"
AND MY FATHER SAID,

15:23.122 --> 15:25.457
"SHUT YOUR DOOR. LOCK IT.
MIND YOUR BUSINESS."

15:25.492 --> 15:27.758
MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT
ANY PART OF THAT, EITHER.

15:27.793 --> 15:30.694
- I GUESS, HAD I BEEN AN ADULT,
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EITHER. - OKAY.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.329
IT'S A LITTLE EERIE.

15:32.364 --> 15:36.032
SO, YOUR DAD -- I KNOW YOU THINK
THAT HE'S HERE.

15:36.067 --> 15:39.804
WHAT IS THERE TO BE NERVOUS
ABOUT WHEN THE ACTIVITY HAPPENS?

15:39.839 --> 15:42.774
AND WHAT -- WHAT IS THERE
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT, LIKE --

15:42.809 --> 15:45.294
LIKE YOUR SISTER
NOT UTILIZING THAT SPACE?

15:45.329 --> 15:47.779
LIKE, WHY THE NERVES
IF YOU THINK IT'S --

15:47.814 --> 15:49.846
IF HE'S HERE PROTECTING?

15:49.881 --> 15:51.315
WELL, THAT'S JUST
MY THEORY ON IT.

15:51.316 --> 15:53.685
SHE THINKS DIFFERENTLY.
- WHAT DOES SHE THINK?

15:53.720 --> 15:56.055
SHE'S JUST AFRAID
OF THE UNKNOWN IN GENERAL.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.856
SHE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S YOUR DAD.

15:59.891 --> 16:02.344
SHE DOESN'T KNOW. SHE DOESN'T
KNOW IF IT'S MY FATHER.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.797
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IF IT'S
SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S WATCHING.

16:10.935 --> 16:12.603
Bruni:
HELLO, MR. BERRY.

16:12.604 --> 16:13.837
I LEARNED A LOT TODAY.

16:13.872 --> 16:16.507
I'M BASICALLY
THE NEW TOWN HISTORIAN

16:16.508 --> 16:18.109
FOR NEW BRITAIN, CONNECTICUT.
- [ LAUGHS ]

16:18.144 --> 16:19.343
- SO...
- AMAZING.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.647
THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN 1924,
WHICH WE KNEW.

16:21.682 --> 16:23.780
- YEAH.
- WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW

16:23.815 --> 16:29.087
WAS THAT THERE ARE TWO DEATHS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE HOUSE.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.821
ONE WAS A PREVIOUS OWNER.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.557
HE HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK
IN THIS HOUSE...

16:32.592 --> 16:33.757
MM-HMM.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.829
...AND, UH, THEN WAS TRANSPORTED
TO THE HOSPITAL

16:36.864 --> 16:39.730
AND PASSED AWAY
A DAY OR TWO LATER.

16:39.765 --> 16:43.132
AND THEN THE KOTEK FAMILY
BOUGHT THE HOUSE IN THE '60s.

16:43.167 --> 16:47.772
NOW, THE KOTEKS, THEY CAME OVER
IN 1956 OR 1957 FROM POLAND.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.841
- MM-HMM.
- HE WAS VERY, VERY SICK.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.678
WHAT I FOUND IS
THAT THEY SOLD THIS HOUSE.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.481
AND THEN 2 MONTHS LATER,
HE DIED.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.981
THAT'S INTERESTING.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.683
SO EVEN THOUGH
HE DIDN'T DIE HERE,

16:59.718 --> 17:02.286
HE COULD STILL REALLY BE
CONNECTED TO THE HOUSE.

17:02.287 --> 17:03.954
OKAY.
THERE'S SO MUCH TO PROCESS.

17:03.989 --> 17:07.025
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A LOT
OF INFORMATION THAT WE CAN USE.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.858
SO HOPEFULLY USING THAT,

17:08.893 --> 17:12.313
IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING
WE GOT FROM THE FAMILY TODAY...

17:12.348 --> 17:15.733
BUT I WILL SAY, I DID GET
A LITTLE STORY FROM SHANNON

17:15.768 --> 17:17.486
ABOUT THE GRANDMOTHER.

17:17.521 --> 17:19.169
BECAUSE I SAID --
I MEAN,

17:19.204 --> 17:21.237
- SHE'S THE ONE THAT HAS
LIVED HERE THE LONGEST. - RIGHT.

17:21.271 --> 17:23.005
SO WHERE'S THE, LIKE --

17:23.040 --> 17:24.840
IF EVERYONE'S HAVING THESE
EXPERIENCES AND THESE STORIES,

17:24.842 --> 17:26.041
LIKE, WHAT IS THIS --

17:26.077 --> 17:27.542
- "HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED
WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER?" - AND?

17:27.578 --> 17:29.479
SHE DID SAY, ONE TIME, THOUGH,

17:29.514 --> 17:31.683
SHE WAS OUT IN THE GARDEN
IN THE BACK,

17:31.718 --> 17:34.484
AND SHE LOOKED INTO
THE CEMETERY,

17:34.519 --> 17:38.390
AND SHE SAW THESE MEN
IN, LIKE, HOODED ROBES

17:38.425 --> 17:40.124
IN THE BACK,
AND IT FREAKED HER OUT.

17:40.159 --> 17:43.761
AND SHE RAN INSIDE
AND CALLED HER HUSBAND,

17:43.796 --> 17:46.729
AT THE TIME,
AND TOLD HIM ABOUT IT.

17:46.764 --> 17:49.766
AND HE SAID, "LOCK THE DOOR
AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS."

17:49.767 --> 17:50.902
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

17:50.937 --> 17:51.937
THIS WAS LEO.

17:51.972 --> 17:52.902
LEO SAID THIS.

17:52.937 --> 17:55.305
HE WAS LIKE, "JUST LOCK THE DOOR
AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS."

17:55.306 --> 17:58.410
SO SHE LOCKED THE DOOR,
AND SHE MINDED HER OWN BUSINESS.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.996
AND, SPEAKING OF
HER GRANDFATHER --

18:01.031 --> 18:03.513
SO THERE IS A ROOM
IN THE BASEMENT.

18:03.548 --> 18:05.817
IT'S A SECRET ROOM.

IT LOOKS LIKE A WALL --

18:08.086 --> 18:10.955
AND THERE'S SOMETHING YOU PULL
AND YOU CAN PUSH THROUGH.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.825
ON THE OTHER SIDE IS ALL OF
THE GRANDFATHER'S TOOLS.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.258
ALL OF HIS STUFF
IS IN THAT ROOM.

18:15.293 --> 18:16.794

THERE WHEN THEY WERE KIDS.

18:16.795 --> 18:20.232

NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY IN THERE.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.798

"BAD THINGS ARE IN THERE,"

18:21.833 --> 18:24.469
BECAUSE I GUESS THEY JUST DON'T
WANT THEM TO BE IN THAT SPACE.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.840

IS DOWN THERE IN THAT ROOM.

SO WE HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE.

18:32.143 --> 18:33.811

AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

TONIGHT.

OF WHO COULD BE HAUNTING
THIS FAMILY.

18:51.729 --> 18:55.049
AND SINCE THE FAMILY
HAS REPORTED UNEXPLAINED NOISES

JERRY'S, LOTS OF PHOTOS.

ARE YOU MR. KOTEK?

TO THE UNITED STATES?

OH, MY GOD.

AFTER THE OTHER,

21:21.431 --> 21:23.281

21:23.316 --> 21:24.614

21:25.984 --> 21:27.417
LET'S GET OUTTA THIS ATTIC.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.053
LET'S FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.672
THAT EVP IS INSANE.

I KNOW. THAT'S CRAZY.

21:39.630 --> 21:41.130
WHAT THE ****

21:41.165 --> 21:44.034
WE WENT THROUGH
ALL THE NAMES.

21:44.035 --> 21:46.037
WENT THROUGH ALL THE NAMES,
AND IT WAS LIKE, "YEP.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.839
THAT'S ME."
- YES. YES.

21:49.874 --> 21:52.642
THIS PERSON
IS IN THE ATTIC.

21:52.677 --> 21:55.447
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE
HE VENTURES OUT SOMETIMES.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.215
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY'VE SEEN A MAN

21:57.250 --> 21:58.781
AND A SHADOW FIGURE

21:58.816 --> 22:01.719
AND WHY THINGS HAVE MOVED.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.588
NOTHING FROM THE FAMILY.
- NO.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.391

ANYTHING FROM THE FAMILY.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.724
THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE.

22:07.759 --> 22:10.260
AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHY.

JUST STARTING TO GET A RESPONSE

22:12.966 --> 22:14.864
FROM THE SPIRIT
OF THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNER.

22:14.899 --> 22:17.568
BUT THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE JUST STOPPED INTERACTING.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.502
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

22:19.537 --> 22:22.306

THE SPIRIT SOME SPACE.

MADE TIME FOR THEM.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.599
PROBABLY TO THE POINT
OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL,

40:02.634 --> 40:04.300
LIKE OCD, YOU KNOW?
- MM-HMM.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.153
THE STACKED DISHES,
FOR INSTANCE...

40:06.188 --> 40:07.937
WHAT WITH THE SPOON
BEING THROWN...

40:07.972 --> 40:09.874
...MIGHT BE
AN IRRITABLE THING FOR HIM...

40:09.909 --> 40:11.574
- YEAH.
- ...FOR THIS MAN.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.277
AND THE FACT
THAT HE GRAVITATED

40:13.312 --> 40:14.910
TOWARDS PROBABLY
AREAS OF THE HOUSE

40:14.945 --> 40:17.164
THAT WERE, LIKE,
MORE TOGETHER LIKE THAT --

40:17.199 --> 40:19.348
THAT -- YOUR LIVING ROOM
AND -- AND THAT AREA.

40:19.383 --> 40:22.019
HE PROBABLY JUST MADE HIMSELF
AT HOME, SAT DOWN, YOU KNOW.

40:22.054 --> 40:23.953
SO IF THAT WAS
WHO WAS THERE,

40:23.988 --> 40:25.656
OR SHADOW FIGURES
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING...

40:25.691 --> 40:27.757
HE, VERY SIMILAR
TO YOUR FATHER,

40:27.792 --> 40:29.424
WAS EXTREMELY HARDWORKING.

40:29.459 --> 40:31.294
- MM-HMM.
- HE NEVER STOPPED WORKING.

40:31.295 --> 40:35.032
MY OPINION, I THINK HE
APPRECIATES THAT KIND OF THING.

40:35.067 --> 40:38.119
I MEAN,
HE COMMUNICATED WITH US.

40:38.154 --> 40:41.136
AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S THERE.
- HE'S...

40:41.171 --> 40:43.406
YOU KNOW, YOU DEFINITELY DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING EVIL OR NEGATIVE.

40:43.407 --> 40:45.041
I KNOW YOU WERE
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.311
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT
HERE.

40:47.346 --> 40:49.512
I THINK YOU --
YOU JUST HAVE A MAN

40:49.547 --> 40:52.380
WHO PUT HIS LIFE'S WORK
INTO THIS HOUSE.

40:52.415 --> 40:55.719
THIS WAS THE END RESULT
OF EVERYTHING HE WENT THROUGH.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.854
- CORRECT.
- AND HE RAISED HIS FAMILY HERE.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.788
AND I JUST THINK, FOR HIM,

40:59.823 --> 41:01.424
THIS IS WHERE
HE WANTS TO STAY.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.026
I THINK IT WOULD
MAKE SENSE. YEAH.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.762
WE DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT

41:05.797 --> 41:07.832
AT ALL, WHATSOEVER.

41:11.702 --> 41:14.104
SO WE INVITED THE TRANSLATOR
TO COME TODAY.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.257
AND WE WERE THINKING
MAYBE WE COULD JUST

41:16.292 --> 41:18.375
ALL GO UP INTO THE ATTIC
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

41:18.410 --> 41:19.775
- MM-HMM.
- AND YOU GUYS...

41:19.810 --> 41:22.129
- SURE.
- ...COULD SPEAK WITH HIM.

41:22.164 --> 41:24.413
AND SHE COULD TRANSLATE
FOR YOU

41:24.448 --> 41:27.049
AND JUST KIND OF LET HIM KNOW
YOUR PLANS

41:27.050 --> 41:29.084
AND HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT HIM BEING HERE,

41:29.119 --> 41:31.822
JUST KIND OF LETTING HIM KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW HE'S HERE NOW.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.374
I THINK THAT WOULD BE
INCREDIBLE.

41:33.409 --> 41:34.892
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT.
- I AGREE.

41:39.463 --> 41:42.449
Bruni: EVEN THOUGH
IT WASN'T WHAT THEY EXPECTED,

41:42.484 --> 41:45.435
REBEKKA AND SHANNON
FINALLY HAVE SOME ANSWERS.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.788
I JUST WANT YOU GUYS
TO MEET MARGARET.

41:47.823 --> 41:49.715
MARGARET SPEAK BEAUTIFUL,
FLUENT POLISH.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.573
YOU'LL GET TO HEAR IT.
IT'S AMAZING.

41:51.608 --> 41:54.044
UM, IF I HAD ANYTHING THAT
I WOULD WANT YOU TO TRANSLATE,

41:54.079 --> 41:56.211
IT WOULD BE THAT
HE IS MORE THAN WELCOME TO STAY.

41:56.246 --> 41:59.415
AND THAT, YES, WE WILL BE TAKING
CARE OF THIS AS WE RENOVATE.

41:59.450 --> 42:02.150
[ SPEAKING IN POLISH ]

42:02.185 --> 42:04.453
Bruni: HOPEFULLY, MARGARET
WILL HELP BRIDGE THE GAP

42:04.454 --> 42:06.556
BETWEEN MR. KOTEK
AND THE GIRLS.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.723
[ SPEAKING IN POLISH ]

42:08.758 --> 42:10.361
Berry:
[ SPEAKING IN POLISH ]

42:13.296 --> 42:16.100
Bruni: NOW SHANNON AND REBEKKA
WILL BE ABLE TO BRING LIFE

42:16.135 --> 42:17.668
BACK INTO THOSE EMPTY ROOMS

42:17.703 --> 42:18.901
AND MOVE ON.

42:18.936 --> 42:20.703
THEIR FATHER WAS
A HARDWORKING MAN

42:20.738 --> 42:22.239
WHO LOVED THIS HOUSE.

42:22.274 --> 42:23.705
AND SO WAS MR. KOTEK.

42:23.740 --> 42:26.442
I'M REALLY HAPPY WE WERE ABLE
TO HONOR BOTH OF THEM

42:26.477 --> 42:27.978
BY TELLING THIS STORY.
