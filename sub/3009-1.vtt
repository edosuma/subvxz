03:01.814 --> 03:03.521
Motherfuckers!

03:09.756 --> 03:10.894
Fuck.

03:42.622 --> 03:45.296
Fuck!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.920
We're almost home, buddy!

04:23.830 --> 04:26.174
Whoo!

04:27.533 --> 04:29.843
Whoo!

04:30.703 --> 04:31.738
Hey.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.681
My name's Alan and I bought a giraffe!

04:35.842 --> 04:37.844
He's all mine!

04:38.811 --> 04:40.347
He's super friendly!

04:51.090 --> 04:52.160
Oh, wow.

04:52.325 --> 04:53.804
Look at the giraffe.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.031
Oh, my God. Where
do you think it's going?

04:56.696 --> 04:57.936
Whoo!

04:58.097 --> 05:01.476
Oh, my life is great! I
have a wonderful life!

05:03.436 --> 05:05.609
I have a wonderful life!

05:37.503 --> 05:42.418
Yes, sir. Absolutely, I will.
Thank you so much. No, of course.

05:42.809 --> 05:46.814
No, no. And again, I'm so sorry.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.654
That was the mayor, Alan.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.896
It was an accident.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.360
You said you'd always love me
no matter what I did.

05:59.525 --> 06:03.337
I know and I do. You're my best friend.
But, Alan, why would you buy a giraffe?

06:03.496 --> 06:06.204
I've always wanted one.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.139
I could feed him from my tree house.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.373
Besides, they remind me a lot of myself.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.941
In what way?

06:14.006 --> 06:17.977
They're majestic, pensive and tall.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.181
- Pensive?
- Yeah.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.849
- Where'd you learn that word?
- "Words With Friends."

06:23.015 --> 06:25.586
- What friends, Alan?
- You can set it on random.

06:27.086 --> 06:31.933
Alan, aside from the fact
that you shut down a freeway...

06:32.525 --> 06:35.938
...you murdered a wild animal.
It's national news.

06:36.095 --> 06:39.099
You don't want to know the checks
I had to write to fix this.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.108
Oh, please. We're rich.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.679
We are not anything, Alan.

06:43.836 --> 06:47.477
I am well-off. You are
my 40-year-old son...

06:47.640 --> 06:49.347
Forty-two. I'm 42!

06:49.509 --> 06:52.956
...42-year-old son who still lives at home.

06:53.112 --> 06:56.582
You are to go back on your medication
or I'm cutting you off.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.590
You're bluffing. When's dinner?

07:00.286 --> 07:02.596
Your mother and I can't take this anymore!

07:02.755 --> 07:05.634
- Well, you might have to.
- I can't do it!

07:05.792 --> 07:06.998
I cannot do this!

07:08.361 --> 07:11.240
<i>I don't care what you say anymore</i>

07:11.397 --> 07:13.274
<i>This is my life</i>

07:14.367 --> 07:21.307
<i>Go ahead with your own life
Leave me alone</i>

07:21.474 --> 07:25.081
<i>Keep it to yourself
It's my life</i>

07:28.514 --> 07:30.926
Alan! Alan!

07:32.919 --> 07:33.419
<i>Ave</i>

07:37.723 --> 07:38.223
<i>Maria</i>

08:04.984 --> 08:07.157
My God, he's got the voice of an angel.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.890
It's breathtaking.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.468
<i>Ave</i>

08:12.625 --> 08:13.125
<i>Maria</i>

08:26.839 --> 08:28.682
I can't believe my daddy is dead.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.890
I can think of so many people
I would rather have died first.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.321
Like my mother.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.225
As many of you know...

08:40.352 --> 08:43.926
...my father and I were extremely close.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.530
He was my life partner.

08:48.661 --> 08:52.131
He would often tell me,
almost on a daily basis...

08:52.298 --> 08:53.902
...that I was his favorite child.

08:55.234 --> 08:58.613
I'll always remember the last words
he said to me:

08:59.438 --> 09:01.281
"I'm proud of you, Alan."

09:01.674 --> 09:03.051
"Never change."

09:04.443 --> 09:06.081
Well...

09:06.245 --> 09:09.158
...I heard you loud and clear, Daddy.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.786
I will never change.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.731
Never, ever.

09:16.088 --> 09:17.431
Oh, Mom.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.763
Go ahead, chief.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.837
Sid Garner was a beloved husband...

09:27.199 --> 09:28.576
...father and neighbor.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.307
Wow, rough day.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.248
- Yeah, how's Tracy doing?
- Not great.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.583
Her mother's totally on the edge,
and if all this weren't enough...

09:39.745 --> 09:42.589
...apparently Alan's been off his meds
for almost six months.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.954
Oh, boy.

09:44.116 --> 09:46.153
Yeah, it has not been pretty.

09:46.319 --> 09:50.028
- Then there's the whole fucking giraffe thing.
- I thought that was pretty funny.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.998
- What?
- Come on. He killed a giraffe.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.831
Who gives a fuck?

09:54.627 --> 09:58.973
You know, I wasn't gonna say anything, but
Alan's been stopping by my office lately.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.008
You're kidding me. What for?

10:01.167 --> 10:05.877
I don't know. He just sits in the waiting
room and reads Highlights magazine.

10:06.038 --> 10:09.281
Fills in the puzzles, whatever he can,
and then leaves.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.087
Check it out.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.026
Wow. Jesus, what
are you gonna do with him?

10:17.183 --> 10:19.925
Actually,
I wanted to talk to you guys about that.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.623
Linda really wants to stage
an intervention for him.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.631
An intervention? Really?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.599
I think that sounds like a great idea.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.602
Yeah, the thing is...

10:28.761 --> 10:33.471
...she's pretty convinced he won't agree
to it unless all of us are there.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.435
I mean, you know how he is.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.775
I don't know. It seems a
little extreme to me.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.781
Oh, God. Look at him now.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.817
Okay, I'm in. When are we doing it?

10:51.017 --> 10:52.655
So we talked to Tracy today...

10:52.818 --> 10:56.288
...and she said that the treatment facility
that they found is really nice.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.459
It's beautiful. I checked it out online.
Great reputation.

10:59.625 --> 11:03.664
Who gives a fuck? It's in Arizona. We gotta
go on like a two-day drive for this shit?

11:03.829 --> 11:04.864
Here we go.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.739
They should just save their money
and send him to fat camp.

11:07.900 --> 11:08.970
- Phil.
- What?

11:09.135 --> 11:12.173
He should lose weight. He'll find a woman.
The dude's lonely.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.217
If he's so lonely,
why don't the you spend more time with him?

11:15.374 --> 11:18.753
- No, trust me, you don't want that.
- No. You definitely don't want that.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.855
Come on. He's not that bad.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.926
I mean, what's the worst that's happened?
The tattoo?

11:26.452 --> 11:28.693
Yeah, the tattoo's the worst.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.026
Right?

11:30.189 --> 11:33.170
Definitely. Tattoo was the worst.
Nightmare.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.462
Speaking of which, you ever get tested?

11:36.629 --> 11:37.767
Excuse me?

11:37.930 --> 11:39.341
You know, because of the ink.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.008
That went inside you.

11:44.336 --> 11:45.838
I'm fine.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.546
- Take care.
- All right, good luck tomorrow.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.120
Oh, thanks.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.082
- I'll pick you up at 11.
- Perfect.

11:55.247 --> 11:56.351
Thank you so much.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.095
Thanks.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.196
- Again, thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, of course.

12:09.361 --> 12:12.240
This is Nico. Nico is a
good friend of Alan's.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.436
- What's up, bros?
- Oh, yeah, hey.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.447
And that's Blanca. Blanca's been with us
since Alan was a baby.

12:18.604 --> 12:19.947
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:20.106 --> 12:23.280
And this is Timothy.
Timothy lives across the street.

12:23.442 --> 12:24.921
He and Alan swim together.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.249
- Hey, what's up, little man?
- Hey.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.485
- Why don't you guys take a seat?
- Yeah.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.725
Tracy's on her way back
with Alan right now.

12:34.887 --> 12:39.563
Obviously, he has no idea this is coming,
so things might get a little intense.

12:39.725 --> 12:42.262
But, no matter what happens, remember:

12:42.428 --> 12:45.341
This is all about Alan getting better.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.246
Mother, Oreo smoothie, now!

12:52.171 --> 12:53.582
Oh.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.320
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey.

12:56.475 --> 12:59.354
Hey, Timothy. Little cold
for a swim, isn't it?

13:00.346 --> 13:03.486
Oh, wow. Look. You went to the pier today.
How was that?

13:03.649 --> 13:05.651
- We had a great time.
- Yeah.

13:05.818 --> 13:09.857
I played skee ball for, like, 45 minutes.
It was a pretty sick workout.

13:10.022 --> 13:11.797
What's going on?

13:11.957 --> 13:15.700
Uh, ahem, why don't you have a seat, bud?
We just want to talk to you for a sec.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.704
Okay.

13:20.699 --> 13:23.202
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey. Yeah.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.872
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

13:26.205 --> 13:27.240
Oh, you got me.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.720
So, Alan...

13:31.877 --> 13:36.019
...we're all here to tell you
about an awesome place...

13:36.182 --> 13:37.820
...called New Horizons.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.893
That does sound awesome.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.857
Alan, this is an intervention.

13:44.356 --> 13:45.391
A what?

13:46.425 --> 13:47.460
Mom.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.775
Alan.

13:52.498 --> 13:56.002
"I love you so much. We all do."

13:56.168 --> 13:59.206
"But we can't keep lying to each other."

13:59.371 --> 14:01.282
"Ever since you were a baby, all I want..."

14:01.440 --> 14:03.716
Oh, my God, is anybody else falling asleep?

14:03.876 --> 14:05.048
Alan, listen.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.657
- No offense, Mom, but you're boring.
- Mr. Alan.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.048
Oh, now you?

14:09.215 --> 14:12.025
"I pick up after you for 30 years."

14:12.184 --> 14:16.189
"I cleaned your room.
I see things no one should ever see."

14:16.655 --> 14:18.032
"But I pray for you."

14:18.490 --> 14:20.993
- "Mr. Alan, everyone..."
- Hey.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.197
- Someone should clean that up.
- Alan.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.434
Alan. You are not well.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.739
You're off your meds and you're
clearly upsetting your whole family.

14:29.902 --> 14:33.213
- That's baloney.
- Alan, if you say yes to this...

14:33.372 --> 14:37.013
...we drive you there today, and I promise
you will come back a changed man.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.548
Who's we? What do you mean, "we"?
Who's we?

14:41.714 --> 14:45.025
We. All of us. Stu, Phil, me, you.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.597
You going, Phil?

14:54.260 --> 14:56.206
I love you, Alan.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.982
Hey, Alan, you hungry?

15:44.143 --> 15:46.123
You wanna get some Arby's?

15:46.278 --> 15:47.951
No, thanks.

15:49.982 --> 15:55.091
You know, I meant to tell you earlier,
that's a really cool vest you got on.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.001
Thanks, Phil. It was my dad's.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.534
He died in it.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.069
Whoa.

16:01.226 --> 16:02.933
That's intense.

16:03.095 --> 16:06.975
Hey, Alan, just want to say what you're
doing is really brave. We're proud of you.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.873
Yeah, you're gonna do great.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.878
Stop the car.
I don't want to do this anymore.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.018
- What?
- I changed my mind.

16:15.174 --> 16:18.053
Alan, you can't change your mind.
Everybody's counting on you.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.884
I'm fine just the way I am.
I want to go home.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.806
Turn the car around. Now, please!
I don't...

16:24.350 --> 16:25.852
What the fuck was that?

16:27.953 --> 16:30.661
- Oh, my God! He's doing it on purpose!
- Get out of his way!

16:30.823 --> 16:32.302
I am, I am.

16:35.961 --> 16:39.135
- Hey! Hey, get the fuck off!
- You have to exchange information.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.073
- Why?
- Jesus. Phil!

16:42.267 --> 16:43.644
- Phil! Phil!
- Oh, shit!

16:50.576 --> 16:52.886
- Get away from him!
- I'm trying!

16:55.381 --> 16:57.520
- Look out!
- Oh, shit!

16:59.318 --> 17:01.491
Aw, shit! Oh, shit.

17:05.223 --> 17:06.294
Shit!

17:06.825 --> 17:07.859
Go, go, go!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.869
Lock your doors! Doug, lock your doors!

17:10.029 --> 17:11.872
Shit! What's going on?

17:13.365 --> 17:14.742
Get the fuck... Hang on!

17:21.673 --> 17:24.449
- Help!
- Let go, fucking asshole!

17:38.757 --> 17:40.737
- Stu! We're okay.
- We're in an elevator!

17:40.893 --> 17:42.133
Where are you?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.566
What the fuck is going on?

17:52.271 --> 17:55.184
Please, this is a huge mistake.

17:55.374 --> 17:56.819
You got the wrong guys!

17:56.975 --> 18:00.115
I got the right fucking guys! Get him up.
Pick him up. Put him here.

18:00.312 --> 18:04.385
- You're Black Doug! That's Black Doug!
- Shut the fuck up with that. Shut the fuck up.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.223
Oh, my God. It is.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.891
Alan, tell me right now,
why is Black Doug kidnapping us?

18:10.055 --> 18:12.331
- I said don't call me that shit no more.
- Sorry.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.732
- It ain't Alan's fault.
- Thank you, Black Doug.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.071
- Motherfucker!
- Doug!

18:17.229 --> 18:18.401
- Doug!
- Okay, okay.

18:18.564 --> 18:19.770
- Just Doug, okay?
- Yeah.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.040
Why are you doing this?

18:23.202 --> 18:24.613
Because...

18:26.705 --> 18:28.707
...I told him to.

18:28.874 --> 18:29.978
I'm Marshall.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.480
And whether you know it or not...

18:33.245 --> 18:35.623
...we all have something in common.

18:36.415 --> 18:40.989
And it all started four years ago
when this moron...

18:41.887 --> 18:45.096
...sold the wrong drugs to this dumb fuck.

18:45.257 --> 18:50.104
You have no idea the chain of events
that were set in motion that night...

18:50.262 --> 18:53.937
...in the parking lot of
a fucking liquor store.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.687
What up, nigga?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.497
Excuse me?

19:16.655 --> 19:19.101
Chill out, I'm not a cop.
Just in town for the night.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.329
Me and my boys looking to get our freak on.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.632
You sold Alan roofies.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.842
Oh, shit. I must've mixed up the bags.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.343
My fault, Alan.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.505
Damn. Marshall gonna be pissed off at me
on that one.

19:32.804 --> 19:35.683
<i>Damn. Marshall gonna be
pissed off at me on that one.</i>

19:35.874 --> 19:37.376
Marshall?

19:37.543 --> 19:39.454
You're Marshall.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.887
You brought us out here because of that?

19:43.382 --> 19:45.726
You're not here because of that.

19:45.884 --> 19:50.094
You're here because some Chinaman
I never heard of strolls into my town...

19:50.255 --> 19:52.599
...and takes one of my guys off the street.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.431
- Mr. Chow?
- Yes.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.766
Yes, Mr. Leslie fucking Chow.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.000
You introduced a virus into my life.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.008
Oh, God, what did he do?

20:01.166 --> 20:02.440
He fucked me in the ass.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.672
Oh, he does that from time to time.

20:05.904 --> 20:07.747
Not literally.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.175
Jesus!

20:12.177 --> 20:15.784
A few weeks after your
bullshit, I get word...

20:15.948 --> 20:18.622
...this sheik is coming in from Abu Dhabi.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.531
<i>He was looking to make some
less-than-legal investments.</i>

20:25.424 --> 20:26.903
<i>He brought his two wives...</i>

20:27.059 --> 20:30.302
<i>...and $42 million in gold bars.</i>

20:32.431 --> 20:33.569
<i>It was a lay-up.</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:35.143
Get down! Get down!

20:38.036 --> 20:40.539
<i>We took it all.</i>

20:41.473 --> 20:45.478
<i>Two vans, each with 21 million in gold.</i>

20:45.978 --> 20:47.821
<i>My guys split up.</i>

20:49.648 --> 20:51.719
<i>One of them made it back...</i>

20:55.187 --> 20:56.962
<i>...one of them didn't.</i>

21:05.731 --> 21:07.074
Is there a problem, officer?

21:07.232 --> 21:08.836
Not anymore, motherfucker.

21:11.837 --> 21:15.546
Leslie Chow stole $21 million from me...

21:15.707 --> 21:17.084
...on a Tuesday.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.049
Oh, God.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.118
I looked everywhere for him.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.191
But he's gone, no one can find him.

21:23.348 --> 21:27.797
Until the little cockroach got
himself pinched in Bangkok.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.831
Sol pay him a visit.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.137
<i>I offer him a truce.</i>

21:36.728 --> 21:38.969
<i>I won't touch a hair on his head.</i>

21:39.131 --> 21:42.601
<i>I just want him to tell
me where my gold is.</i>

21:42.868 --> 21:44.472
<i>He refuses to talk.</i>

21:53.445 --> 21:56.483
Not only does he refuse to talk to me...

21:56.648 --> 22:00.562
...he has no communication with anyone
from the outside...

22:00.719 --> 22:02.027
...except you!

22:02.187 --> 22:03.530
Hey.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.100
It's unfair!

22:05.257 --> 22:06.895
Alan, you been talking to Chow?

22:07.059 --> 22:09.630
- They've been writing letters.
- Hey, those are private!

22:10.028 --> 22:15.171
"Dear Leslie, OMG, the McRib is back!
Why was it ever gone?"

22:15.334 --> 22:16.506
Exactly!

22:16.668 --> 22:19.581
"Dear Alan,
I threw urine on prison guard today."

22:19.738 --> 22:21.877
"Blamed it on cellmate.
Wish you were here."

22:22.040 --> 22:23.644
Yeah, I wish I could've seen that.

22:23.809 --> 22:27.916
Letter after letter of total nonsense...

22:28.080 --> 22:30.082
...except for one common thread:

22:30.248 --> 22:31.727
You guys!

22:32.617 --> 22:33.823
The wolf pack.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.396
Jesus Christ, Alan.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.169
Five weeks ago, Chow escaped
from maximum security detention.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.068
Oh, fuck.

22:41.226 --> 22:44.230
He stowed aboard a shipping freighter
bound for the West Coast.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.640
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

22:50.802 --> 22:53.942
Alan, if you know where he is,
you tell this man right now.

22:54.840 --> 22:58.185
Phil, I don't know, I swear.
I haven't talked to him in months.

23:04.282 --> 23:05.955
We gotta do it the hard way.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.761
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck? Hey!

23:08.920 --> 23:11.127
- Let's go.
- Hey! No! No! What the fuck?

23:11.289 --> 23:12.461
Whoa, what are you doing?

23:12.791 --> 23:15.772
Doug is my insurance. He stays with me.

23:15.927 --> 23:18.533
You don't give me Chow,
I blow his brains out.

23:18.697 --> 23:19.971
You go to the cops...

23:20.465 --> 23:21.671
...I blow his brains out.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.439
That's insane! We don't even know
where the fuck he is!

23:24.603 --> 23:26.446
No one does.

23:26.605 --> 23:30.052
But I figure the wolf pack
has the best chance of finding him.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.278
You have three days.

23:32.043 --> 23:33.454
Get to work.

23:35.881 --> 23:37.986
Can you take Stu instead?

23:38.250 --> 23:39.490
Fuck you, Alan.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.088
Shit.

23:48.493 --> 23:49.836
Shit!

23:50.896 --> 23:52.933
- Alan.
- Yeah, Phil?

23:53.098 --> 23:56.011
I need you to roll over here
and chew off these hand-ties.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.408
Okay.

23:59.337 --> 24:00.907
- Oh.
- Damn it!

24:01.106 --> 24:03.245
Ow. Oh, fuck!

24:03.708 --> 24:05.748
- Got a little too much steam.
- Get off me.

24:05.877 --> 24:07.948
All right, let me just shimmy down.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.422
- Would you just hold still? Hold still!
- Ow.

24:10.582 --> 24:11.890
Help!

24:12.751 --> 24:14.287
Help!

24:21.426 --> 24:23.428
Holy shit.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.136
What are we gonna do, Stu?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.972
- We're gonna go to the police.
- Oh, no, we're fucking not.

24:29.367 --> 24:31.176
Did you hear that guy?

24:31.336 --> 24:32.815
He will kill Doug, period.

24:33.572 --> 24:34.983
Chow is a cancer.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.484
He's been a cancer
since the first day we met him.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.384
We're gonna hand him over to Marshall
and then it's done.

24:40.545 --> 24:41.785
- Hey, Phil.
- Alan, not now.

24:41.947 --> 24:44.052
But I need you, Stu. I can't do this alone.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.060
Do what alone?
We have no idea where he even is.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.357
- Phil.
- What, Alan?

24:48.520 --> 24:51.091
I was gonna say I got this strange e-mail
the other day.

24:51.256 --> 24:54.703
I wasn't sure what it meant,
but now I think it might be from Chow.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.133
"Fatty, it feels good to be out."

24:58.296 --> 25:01.334
"I'm close by. Tell no one.
I'll be in touch."

25:01.500 --> 25:02.706
"Chow."

25:04.970 --> 25:08.076
This says "Chow."
How did you not know this was from Chow?

25:08.240 --> 25:10.652
At the time, I thought it was "Chow"
like "goodbye."

25:10.809 --> 25:12.482
You know, like, <i>"Chow, arrivederci."</i>

25:12.644 --> 25:15.181
- You know, Sbarro, Papa John's.
- I'm writing him back.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.122
Whoa, wait, wait. Just hold on.

25:17.282 --> 25:19.762
Gonna tell him you're happy he's out
and you'd love to see him.

25:19.918 --> 25:22.091
Ooh, I would love to see him.

25:22.787 --> 25:24.596
Do you even know what's going on?

25:24.756 --> 25:28.636
Yes, I do. Phil's doing all the work,
I'm his assistant...

25:28.793 --> 25:32.536
- ...you're standing there looking like an idiot.
- I'm gonna arrange a meeting...

25:32.697 --> 25:35.610
- ...and we're gonna take him out.
- "Take him out"?

25:35.767 --> 25:37.906
Who says that?
How do we take someone out?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.279
We'll use drugs.

25:41.439 --> 25:43.180
Prescription drugs.

25:43.341 --> 25:45.787
You know, the kind a dentist has access to.

25:45.944 --> 25:49.289
Good luck finding a dentist
who will write fake prescriptions.

25:49.447 --> 25:51.723
Oh, I know one. His name is Stuart Price.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.692
Now let's go find a fucking pharmacy.

25:54.986 --> 25:58.058
Whoo! You just got schooled, son.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.797
Are you coming or not?

25:59.958 --> 26:01.403
I don't like this plan.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.131
Okay, then. Ciao.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.747
I got a pretty dope sense of humor, bro!

26:18.176 --> 26:20.816
This amount with syringes is just weird.
Go check it out.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.552
Everything okay?

26:23.715 --> 26:25.888
Well, it's just a strange request.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.258
This drug in this amount
and a pack of syringes.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.491
- It's just a little weird.
- Yeah.

26:30.655 --> 26:33.568
It's just kind of an emergency, so...

26:33.725 --> 26:37.434
See, that right there, and you're acting
all fidgety, plus you look like shit...

26:37.596 --> 26:39.837
...in our business, these
are all red flags.

26:39.998 --> 26:42.239
I need to call the doctor,
make sure everything's okay.

26:42.400 --> 26:46.473
Aha. You're in luck, because I actually am
the prescribing doctor.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.948
Oh, boy. Another red flag.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.847
It says here you're a dentist.

26:55.013 --> 26:58.153
Yeah. Doctor of Dental Science.

26:59.084 --> 27:00.927
This is fucked up.

27:01.586 --> 27:02.929
Hey, Dad?

27:03.355 --> 27:05.062
I think we got a live one.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.499
How'd we do?

27:10.662 --> 27:13.541
We did good.
I got Demerol, a pack of syringes...

27:13.698 --> 27:16.702
...and almost lost my dental license.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.814
- What about Chow? Anything?
- No.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.678
Oh, look at this.
He e-mailed me like 20 minutes ago.

27:22.207 --> 27:24.050
Alan, we've been sit...

27:24.209 --> 27:25.654
Give me the phone, please.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.846
- What does it say?
- Oh, wow.

27:28.113 --> 27:31.185
He wants to meet Alan tonight at 8.
It says come alone.

27:31.349 --> 27:33.090
- Come alone where?
- A bus stop.

27:34.285 --> 27:35.491
In Tijuana.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.133
Tijuana's the bomb.

27:37.288 --> 27:38.631
Oh, fuck.

27:38.790 --> 27:42.169
No, that's perfect.
No, it's like a three-hour drive from here.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.665
Yeah, Stu, try reading a map.

27:45.230 --> 27:48.234
Yeah, Alan, try reading anything ever.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.074
Yeah, Stu, try not having
such big horse teeth.

27:54.272 --> 27:56.479
All right, we need a plan.

27:56.641 --> 27:59.087
They're meeting on a bus bench
in a public place...

27:59.244 --> 28:02.316
...so Alan needs to convince Chow
to go someplace more private.

28:02.480 --> 28:06.087
Someplace where we can sneak up on him
and drug him.

28:06.651 --> 28:07.686
Like where?

28:07.886 --> 28:09.388
I don't know, like an alley.

28:09.554 --> 28:10.897
What about a movie theater?

28:11.623 --> 28:13.330
Fuck, that's actually a great idea.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.798
The lights go down...

28:15.960 --> 28:19.032
...we take the seats behind him,
we jab him and it's fucking done.

28:19.330 --> 28:22.038
I'll jab him if you want.
I've drugged people before.

28:22.434 --> 28:23.879
Yeah, us.

28:24.035 --> 28:27.539
No offense, but we're not letting you
handle any drugs. You'll kill someone.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.276
Oh, please, I'm an expert.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.250
Remember the marshmallows in Thailand?

28:31.509 --> 28:32.544
Yeah?

28:32.711 --> 28:36.158
I made it so you could eat at least three
before hitting a fatal dose.

28:37.415 --> 28:38.917
Wait.

28:39.084 --> 28:42.793
So you're saying I would've died
if I had had four?

28:43.188 --> 28:45.361
Nobody eats four marshmallows, Stu.

28:45.523 --> 28:48.163
That insane theory is the only reason
I'm still alive?

28:48.326 --> 28:50.863
Yes! And you're welcome, by the way.

28:51.029 --> 28:53.441
Don't say "you're welcome"
for almost killing me.

28:53.598 --> 28:54.633
- Fine.
- Thank you.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.710
- You're welcome.
- Goddamn it!

29:32.771 --> 29:34.148
Oh, God.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.350
You know, you were right.

29:37.976 --> 29:42.356
- About what?
- That place in Arizona. It's not gonna help him.

29:43.848 --> 29:46.522
There is no facility that can fix this guy.

29:47.418 --> 29:50.228
We're gonna spend the rest of our lives
dealing with him...

29:50.388 --> 29:53.665
...because we're all he has now.

29:54.359 --> 29:56.430
You realize that? We're it.

29:58.596 --> 30:00.098
Oh, shit, check it out.

30:00.565 --> 30:01.635
Is that Chow?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.541
Hey, fat stuff.

30:03.701 --> 30:04.941
- Leslie.
- Uh-uh-uh.

30:05.103 --> 30:07.447
- Act cool. Eyes forward.
- Yeah, okay.

30:07.772 --> 30:10.116
- Anyone follow you?
- No, I don't think so.

30:10.275 --> 30:11.618
Good, good.

30:11.776 --> 30:15.280
Gotta keep low profile right now.
Chow wanted man.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.490
Can't trust anyone.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.630
Quick, give me some sugar.
Come on, come on, come on.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.826
What the fuck?

30:23.988 --> 30:25.990
Did he just kiss him?

30:26.157 --> 30:29.263
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pickle, Alan.

30:29.427 --> 30:32.169
- I need a friend.
- Well, I'm your friend, Leslie.

30:32.597 --> 30:35.271
Exactly. That's why I called you down here.

30:35.433 --> 30:38.346
You're the only person I can trust
in this shit-hole of a life.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.847
That's not true.
Stu and Phil are your friends.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.113
Oh, really?

30:43.308 --> 30:44.719
That's interesting.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.686
Where are they?

30:47.812 --> 30:49.587
- Around.
- Around where?

30:49.747 --> 30:50.953
I don't know.

30:56.955 --> 31:00.232
- Motherfucker! I told you to come alone!
- Leslie.

31:00.391 --> 31:01.426
Shit.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.073
- What happened?
- Is he leaving?

31:03.194 --> 31:05.262
We'll talk more! I'll
give you another kiss!

31:05.263 --> 31:06.401
He's coming this way.

31:06.564 --> 31:08.339
Get down. Get down.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.877
- Fuck.
- Leslie!

31:11.035 --> 31:12.946
Oh, fuck.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.707
- Get out of the car, you mutts!
- Leslie, no!

31:15.874 --> 31:18.377
- Get off me, fat clown!
- Chow! Chow, calm down!

31:18.543 --> 31:20.580
- Who sent you?
- No one! No.

31:20.745 --> 31:24.022
- We just wanted to see you!
- Liar! No one wants to see Chow!

31:24.182 --> 31:27.254
No, we... We miss you.

31:27.418 --> 31:30.194
- What?
- We miss you, Chow!

31:30.355 --> 31:32.631
- That's it.
- Yeah.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.292
We miss you.

31:35.493 --> 31:36.597
You miss me?

31:37.362 --> 31:38.864
So much.

31:43.201 --> 31:45.704
You miss Chow.

31:47.305 --> 31:48.375
Yeah, buddy.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.320
We love you, Chow.

31:59.617 --> 32:04.828
<i>I hurt myself today</i>

32:05.690 --> 32:10.105
<i>To see if I still feel</i>

32:10.895 --> 32:14.308
<i>I focus on the pain</i>

32:16.067 --> 32:21.107
<i>The only thing that's real</i>

32:21.673 --> 32:24.847
<i>What have I become</i>

32:25.009 --> 32:27.250
What the fuck am I watching?

32:27.578 --> 32:30.525
<i>My sweetest friend</i>

32:32.083 --> 32:35.690
<i>Everyone I know</i>

32:35.853 --> 32:37.264
<i>Goes away in the end</i>

32:37.422 --> 32:40.028
- Is that gonna be enough?
- Oh, yeah.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.866
This will take about a minute to kick in.
We'll tell the waitress he's drunk.

32:46.030 --> 32:48.340
By the time we get to the car,
he'll be out cold.

32:48.499 --> 32:51.378
<i>My empire of dirt</i>

32:52.370 --> 32:56.477
<i>I will let you down</i>

32:57.675 --> 33:02.215
<i>I will make you hurt</i>

33:08.086 --> 33:09.929
Alan, sit down.

33:11.089 --> 33:12.625
That was really nice, Chow.

33:12.790 --> 33:13.928
Thanks, Phil.

33:14.092 --> 33:16.629
The key is to sing from your heart.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.138
So Mexico, huh?
What are you doing down here?

33:19.297 --> 33:23.268
You know, fucking, doing blow.
Same old, same old.

33:23.434 --> 33:24.845
Ooh, I got into cockfighting.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.643
- Oh, cockfighting. That sounds wonderful.
- Yes.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.978
Basically, been killing it down here.

33:30.408 --> 33:33.878
That is just terrific. Right?

33:34.045 --> 33:36.958
I mean, that's terrific.
I think that calls for a toast.

33:37.115 --> 33:38.355
I like that.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.325
- To killing it.
- Killing it.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.590
Yeah, to killing it.

33:43.554 --> 33:44.692
Mm.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.675
You okay, Chow?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.943
I don't know. You tell me.

33:59.804 --> 34:02.250
So how many rooster birds do you have,
Chow?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.356
- Aah!
- Huh?

34:08.446 --> 34:11.120
- Shh. Act cool or I open his vein.
- Oh, my God.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.120
Why you wanna drug poor Chow?

34:13.284 --> 34:16.458
No, no. It's not what you think.
There's this guy Marshall.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.760
Marshall? How you know that fat fuck?

34:18.922 --> 34:22.803
He says you took his gold. He's got Doug.
He'll kill him unless we bring you back.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.237
It's true! I swear to God, it's true!

34:26.864 --> 34:29.071
Chow. Chow, that's the truth.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.846
Goddamn it!

34:35.639 --> 34:37.119
That motherfucker.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.083
Stu, you okay?

34:39.243 --> 34:40.722
- You all right?
- No.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.724
We're sorry, Chow.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.655
We're sorry.

34:44.815 --> 34:47.797
- We didn't know what else to do.
- Next time, don't lie to Chow.

34:47.952 --> 34:51.399
You're right. You are so right,
and we made a huge mistake.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.563
So, what do we do now?

34:56.828 --> 34:58.068
That depends.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.009
Can I trust you?

35:06.270 --> 35:08.341
What is this place, Chow?

35:08.506 --> 35:10.008
My house.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.116
Chow used to be on top of the world.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.884
Had three beautiful homes
in three different countries.

35:17.515 --> 35:20.257
But this one, my Mexican villa...

35:20.985 --> 35:22.692
...this was my favorite.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.295
And everything got fucked.

35:25.990 --> 35:29.233
Chow go to prison, all my property seized.

35:29.393 --> 35:31.066
My homes...

35:31.229 --> 35:33.436
...sold at auction to highest bidders.

35:34.365 --> 35:37.209
But I know something no one else knows.

35:37.435 --> 35:40.041
This house is where I stashed the gold.

35:40.938 --> 35:42.918
- Marshall's gold?
- Yep.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.152
Hid it inside the basement wall.

35:46.944 --> 35:48.890
No one knows it's there.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.018
We're gonna go get it.

35:51.616 --> 35:54.222
Wait. You mean break in?

35:55.520 --> 35:58.126
Look, Marshall wants his gold.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.997
And he's gonna hunt me down
until he gets it.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.036
If we show up without it, he'll kill me.

36:03.194 --> 36:05.174
We're not breaking in anywhere.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.469
Not anywhere, Stu. My house.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.476
It's piece of cake.

36:10.635 --> 36:12.478
I know every square inch of this place.

36:13.905 --> 36:18.684
The best part, the guy we're stealing
it from doesn't even know it's there.

36:19.043 --> 36:21.080
So he'll never know it's gone.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.491
You guys know what's going on, right?

36:28.152 --> 36:29.324
What do you mean?

36:29.487 --> 36:33.060
Well, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
we're not breaking into this house.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.631
This house is too small.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.706
We're breaking into another house.
This is just a model, right?

36:38.863 --> 36:40.501
What? Alan, no!

36:41.299 --> 36:42.676
My chickens!

36:44.268 --> 36:45.542
Oh, shit!

36:45.703 --> 36:46.743
Chow, what the fuck?

36:46.904 --> 36:50.545
Watch out for the claws!
They're trained to kill!

36:50.708 --> 36:52.915
His beak is so sharp!

36:53.077 --> 36:54.112
Ow! Ow!

36:55.613 --> 36:58.093
- Oh, fuck!
- Stay still, I'm trying to help.

36:58.249 --> 36:59.922
- Don't!
- Get it off!

37:02.453 --> 37:05.366
- Fucking bull's-eye!
- Are you out of your mind?

37:05.523 --> 37:07.799
Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!

37:10.494 --> 37:11.939
Stu, the window!

37:14.799 --> 37:15.971
- Get it out!
- Okay, okay!

37:16.133 --> 37:17.544
Get it out!

37:21.372 --> 37:22.976
Shh, shh, shh.

37:23.174 --> 37:26.712
Don't struggle. Let go.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.751
You won a lot of fights, Wallace.

37:33.851 --> 37:34.955
Not this time.

37:44.495 --> 37:48.443
- What the fuck is wrong with those chickens?
- They're angry.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.476
All I feed them is cocaine.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.971
And chicken.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.253
That's some house, Chow.

38:00.411 --> 38:04.188
It was my Shangri-La. Now it's gone.

38:05.082 --> 38:09.497
Could you not spit inside my minivan,
please? Jesus.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.193
Who lives there now?

38:11.355 --> 38:13.995
Some dot-com millionaire.
He's never here.

38:14.158 --> 38:15.728
This is a vacation home.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.668
The help doesn't show up on Sundays.

38:18.162 --> 38:20.335
No one there but the guard dogs. Stu?

38:20.498 --> 38:24.310
We'll toss these burgers over the gate,
wait for the Demerol to kick in.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.914
Make sure you put in enough to kill them.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.108
We're not gonna kill the dogs, Chow.

38:29.273 --> 38:30.946
This will knock them out for hours.

38:31.108 --> 38:33.384
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you worked for PETA.

38:33.544 --> 38:35.649
- What a pussy.
- Ha-ha-ha.

39:07.244 --> 39:08.780
Alan, take that.

39:10.047 --> 39:11.082
Aah!

39:14.151 --> 39:15.755
- Where are you going?
- You'll see.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.498
Pardon me, little loser.

39:18.022 --> 39:21.094
Excuse me, fucking asshole.

39:22.426 --> 39:23.734
Follow me.

39:25.830 --> 39:29.039
<i>Okay, here's the deal:
two security panels inside.</i>

39:29.200 --> 39:31.874
<i>If you cut only one wire,
it triggers alarm.</i>

39:32.036 --> 39:34.073
<i>Place will be crawling with cops.</i>

39:34.238 --> 39:37.685
But if you cut wire on both panels
at same time, alarm disabled.

39:37.842 --> 39:40.914
Yeah, but how are we gonna get inside
without tripping the alarm?

39:41.078 --> 39:42.785
Check this out.

39:45.249 --> 39:47.388
- Any more stupid questions?
- Whoa.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.121
Now, who's coming with me?

39:49.520 --> 39:50.624
I'll do it.

39:51.188 --> 39:52.223
You wanna tell him?

39:53.524 --> 39:54.559
Oh, um...

39:56.961 --> 39:58.804
Alan, you're just too fat.

39:59.497 --> 40:00.840
Roger that.

40:16.614 --> 40:18.184
Ow. Ahh.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.226
You kicked me, you motherfucker.

40:23.788 --> 40:26.325
No, no, no. Don't get up.
Will trip motion detectors.

40:26.490 --> 40:27.696
Stay low like dog.

40:27.858 --> 40:29.804
Okay. Good idea.

40:30.361 --> 40:32.864
- Which way?
- In there. The kitchen.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.836
Aah! What the fuck is that?

40:37.001 --> 40:40.312
Ha, ha.
I'm saying hello. We're dogs, remember?

40:48.212 --> 40:49.350
Hey, Stu?

40:49.513 --> 40:50.924
Check it out.

40:52.516 --> 40:54.996
Oh, my God! So gross!

40:58.456 --> 41:00.959
God! Chow, cut it out!

41:14.338 --> 41:16.318
Okay, I'm here.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.953
Now what?

41:18.108 --> 41:20.384
Pull the cover off so
you can see the wires.

41:20.544 --> 41:21.579
Okay.

41:24.648 --> 41:27.219
Okay. Done!

41:27.384 --> 41:30.263
Okay, on three, cut the gray wire.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.401
One, two...

41:32.556 --> 41:33.694
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

41:33.858 --> 41:36.464
I don't have a gray wire.
I have red, green and yellow.

41:36.627 --> 41:40.507
That's weird. I have light gray,
medium gray, dark gray.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.337
You do?

41:42.733 --> 41:44.007
Motherfucker.

41:44.368 --> 41:46.644
My bad. I'm colorblind.

41:46.804 --> 41:47.839
You're what?

41:48.005 --> 41:50.144
Fuck it, just cut the middle one.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.621
No, my middle one could be different.
The wires are all twisted.

41:53.777 --> 41:56.690
- On three. One, two...
- Chow, stop!

41:57.448 --> 41:58.552
God.

41:59.116 --> 42:01.153
Hold on, I'm coming to you.

42:02.453 --> 42:04.126
What the fuck's taking them so long?

42:04.288 --> 42:06.894
Where'd you get that
shirt, the Diesel store?

42:08.959 --> 42:10.199
Phil.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.840
What?

42:12.496 --> 42:14.999
It's a cute top. Where
did you get that shirt?

42:19.169 --> 42:20.409
What's the problem?

42:22.540 --> 42:25.282
Just point to the wire you want me to cut.

42:25.442 --> 42:27.683
- This gray one right here.
- Great.

42:27.845 --> 42:29.791
For your information, that's green.

42:30.114 --> 42:31.616
Ooh, tsk, tsk, tsk.

42:31.782 --> 42:32.852
Which one's red?

42:33.017 --> 42:35.122
The one in your left hand.

42:35.286 --> 42:40.099
- Wait, which hand is that? I'm also dyslexic.
- What the fuck?

42:41.225 --> 42:44.365
- Where'd you get it?
- I don't know. I'll find out, I'll get you one.

42:44.528 --> 42:48.806
There's a cool Diesel store in the mall that I
like to go to. Right next to the food court.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.946
I don't know if it's Diesel.

42:51.468 --> 42:53.277
Looks like a Diesel.

42:55.773 --> 42:57.047
What's the matter with you?

42:57.207 --> 42:59.881
Okay, you're still holding
the one I left you with, right?

43:00.044 --> 43:01.318
Pretty much. Heh, heh.

43:01.478 --> 43:03.082
Oh, fuck.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.158
All right. On three!

43:06.317 --> 43:07.455
One...

43:08.252 --> 43:09.356
...two...

43:10.254 --> 43:11.392
...three.

43:17.328 --> 43:19.467
Holy shit, it worked.

43:23.667 --> 43:24.771
All good?

43:25.603 --> 43:27.378
- Easy peasy.
- All right.

43:27.538 --> 43:28.710
You have no idea.

43:28.872 --> 43:29.976
Come on.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.948
Whoops.

43:33.711 --> 43:35.657
- Jesus, be careful, Chow.
- Ha, ha.

43:35.813 --> 43:37.520
Fuck this guy.

43:37.681 --> 43:40.753
Living in my house. Living my life.

43:40.918 --> 43:42.591
Can we just stick to the plan?

43:42.753 --> 43:43.788
Fine.

43:44.922 --> 43:47.061
Ha, ha. Ruined.

43:48.692 --> 43:50.433
He is completely out of control.

43:50.594 --> 43:52.505
Let's just get this done.

43:57.034 --> 43:59.605
This way. Come on, come on.

44:07.277 --> 44:09.052
It's buried behind this wall.

44:09.513 --> 44:12.119
- Alan.
- Here you go, boss.

44:17.354 --> 44:18.560
Aah!

44:19.256 --> 44:20.291
Fuck!

44:20.457 --> 44:22.596
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.433
Just warming up.

44:24.595 --> 44:27.405
It's so heavy. Do we have a lighter one?

44:27.564 --> 44:31.535
- Why don't you just let me do it, Chow?
- Okay. Either way, you or me. Same thing.

44:43.247 --> 44:45.693
You might wanna take your shirt off.
Makes it easier.

44:45.849 --> 44:48.853
- What?
- I've heard that too.

45:25.155 --> 45:29.228
See that? Chow come back for you.

45:47.144 --> 45:48.316
That's the last of it.

45:48.979 --> 45:50.481
You sure?

45:51.749 --> 45:53.956
- Yeah.
- You triple sure?

45:54.985 --> 45:58.660
- Yes!
- Good! Heh-heh-heh.

46:00.190 --> 46:01.396
Chow?

46:07.698 --> 46:08.938
Chow?

46:09.666 --> 46:10.736
Chow!

46:12.169 --> 46:13.580
Chow!

46:15.139 --> 46:16.413
Chow!

46:16.573 --> 46:18.018
Chow!

46:27.351 --> 46:30.161
Chow, open this fucking door right now!

46:45.235 --> 46:46.805
Chow!

47:06.957 --> 47:08.561
Stuart Price.

47:08.992 --> 47:11.495
No felonies. One arrest:

47:11.662 --> 47:12.697
Las Vegas, Nevada.

47:15.065 --> 47:16.169
Phil Wenneck.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.244
No felonies. One arrest:

47:18.569 --> 47:20.879
Also Las Vegas, Nevada.

47:24.608 --> 47:26.315
Alan Garner.

47:31.415 --> 47:32.985
Is this record accurate?

47:38.455 --> 47:39.900
Uh-huh.

47:40.958 --> 47:42.699
I did that. Mm-hm.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.339
Yeah.

47:45.295 --> 47:48.674
Masturbating on a city bus.
Yep, that was me.

47:48.832 --> 47:50.709
Look, we've been here for 5 hours.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.779
We already told your guys everything.

47:52.936 --> 47:54.006
No.

47:54.171 --> 47:56.742
You told them a story
about a little Chinese man.

47:56.907 --> 47:59.513
Leslie Chow. He's an international
criminal. Look it up.

47:59.676 --> 48:02.555
A little Chinese man that no one in town
has seen or heard of.

48:02.713 --> 48:05.193
The hotel where you say he's staying?
No one there.

48:05.349 --> 48:07.386
Probably because he left town.

48:08.051 --> 48:09.496
That's one theory.

48:09.653 --> 48:11.394
Another theory is that you're lying.

48:14.458 --> 48:17.803
"Lewd behavior, Cracker Barrel,
Christmas Eve."

48:26.103 --> 48:27.241
Excuse me.

48:33.277 --> 48:35.154
We're fucking dead.

48:36.046 --> 48:38.856
Why would Mr. Chow do this?

48:39.683 --> 48:42.823
Because he's a greedy piece of shit
who used us.

48:43.787 --> 48:45.960
- Yeah, but he's our friend.
- Oh.

48:46.123 --> 48:47.625
Grow up, Alan.

48:51.261 --> 48:52.433
You're free to leave.

48:52.596 --> 48:54.872
All the charges have been dropped.

48:55.532 --> 48:56.670
By who?

48:56.833 --> 48:58.312
It's your lucky day.

48:58.468 --> 49:00.505
There's a car waiting for you out front.

49:01.438 --> 49:03.440
Come on, let's go.

49:07.444 --> 49:09.219
Oh, Jesus.

49:11.882 --> 49:13.020
What?

49:16.420 --> 49:17.831
I'm sorry.

49:19.222 --> 49:20.257
What is this?

49:21.325 --> 49:22.633
Get in the car.

49:32.936 --> 49:34.347
Excuse me, sir?

49:34.771 --> 49:35.806
Where we headed?

50:04.134 --> 50:05.670
Welcome back.

50:15.979 --> 50:18.960
- What the fuck?
- Let's go, guys.

50:24.054 --> 50:25.863
Out to the back.

50:37.100 --> 50:39.273
- Doug?
- Guys. Careful.

50:39.436 --> 50:41.074
Get your ass back over here.

50:41.238 --> 50:43.184
Leslie Chow never lived here.

50:44.941 --> 50:47.478
You didn't break into his old house.

50:47.978 --> 50:49.616
You broke into my house.

50:50.947 --> 50:52.017
I don't understand.

50:52.482 --> 50:56.020
You didn't get back the gold
he stole from me.

50:57.621 --> 50:59.897
You got the other half that he didn't.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.832
Oh. my God!

51:01.992 --> 51:04.370
What, you mean the half he never had?

51:04.528 --> 51:07.475
He's a world-class rat,
and you three were his accomplices.

51:07.631 --> 51:08.701
- No!
- We had no idea.

51:08.865 --> 51:11.471
We were trying to help you.
We thought you'd be happy!

51:11.635 --> 51:13.581
Thank you so much.

51:13.737 --> 51:16.274
Thank you for ripping me off.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.317
Thank you for desecrating my home!

51:18.475 --> 51:21.319
And thank you for killing my fucking dogs!

51:21.478 --> 51:23.890
We didn't kill your dogs.
They're just tranquilized.

51:24.214 --> 51:27.024
Oh, right.

51:27.584 --> 51:28.756
You don't know.

51:28.919 --> 51:31.900
- Chow snapped their necks on his way out.
- What?

51:32.055 --> 51:34.763
And somebody's gotta pay.

51:34.958 --> 51:37.268
- He's right.
- No, no, no! Aah!

51:45.569 --> 51:47.742
My head of security.

51:47.904 --> 51:52.011
Couldn't stop three fuckups and a Chinaman
with a pair of wire cutters.

51:52.609 --> 51:53.644
Unreal.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.685
Aw. Man.

52:00.350 --> 52:02.489
That's okay. I know it's scary.

52:02.652 --> 52:06.156
Hector. Run upstairs and grab a pair
of sweatpants for Alan here.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.133
I'm a 44 slim.

52:08.725 --> 52:10.864
Can you bring me a few options?

52:11.895 --> 52:14.876
You found Chow once. Find him again.

52:15.031 --> 52:16.305
And my gold.

52:17.367 --> 52:18.471
Wait.

52:18.635 --> 52:21.844
We don't even have a car.
Chow stole my minivan.

52:22.005 --> 52:24.645
Take the limo. Hector has the keys.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.549
And get going.

52:27.244 --> 52:29.281
I'm killing Dougs today.

52:36.186 --> 52:38.530
- I never saw anyone get killed before.
- Right?

52:38.688 --> 52:40.725
My God, that was so intense.

52:40.891 --> 52:43.770
I mean, he just fell and then he's dead.

52:43.927 --> 52:45.099
I feel sick.

52:45.262 --> 52:46.536
Me too.

52:46.763 --> 52:49.437
Well, maybe we should get some food, guys.

52:52.736 --> 52:55.478
What are we gonna do?
We have no idea where Chow is.

52:55.639 --> 52:57.312
I don't know.

52:57.474 --> 52:59.852
He took your minivan.
We could report it stolen...

53:00.010 --> 53:01.853
...and then they could track him down?

53:02.445 --> 53:03.981
It's worth a shot.

53:05.982 --> 53:07.620
Oh, fuck!

53:07.784 --> 53:09.320
I left my phone in the minivan.

53:09.853 --> 53:12.925
Well, if you lost your phone, Phil,
I have that <i>Find My Phone</i> app.

53:13.089 --> 53:15.091
We have bigger problems than that, Alan.

53:15.258 --> 53:17.795
No, wait, wait, wait.
If your phone's in the minivan...

53:17.961 --> 53:20.601
...and Chow has the minivan,
then your phone's with Chow!

53:20.764 --> 53:23.540
You heard him.
We have bigger problems than that, Stu.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.680
Alan, give me your phone. Quick.

53:25.869 --> 53:27.746
- That's brilliant.
- Yes.

53:28.038 --> 53:29.984
- Wait, what's your password?
- "Hey Phil."

53:30.140 --> 53:31.380
- Yeah?
- No, that's it.

53:31.541 --> 53:32.781
- What?
- That's my password.

53:32.943 --> 53:34.115
"Hey Phil."

53:36.646 --> 53:37.886
It is it.

53:39.282 --> 53:40.590
Phil gets it.

53:40.750 --> 53:43.424
Nothing worse than losing your phone.

53:44.154 --> 53:47.328
You just saw a man get murdered.
Your brother-in-law is kidnapped.

53:47.490 --> 53:48.969
You sure there's nothing worse?

53:49.326 --> 53:50.930
You don't get it, Stu.

53:51.094 --> 53:54.803
You just don't get it, do you?

53:54.965 --> 53:57.741
I have over 60 apps on that phone.

53:57.901 --> 53:59.676
What if I lost my phone?

53:59.836 --> 54:03.374
Do you have any idea how much time
and man-hours it would take...

54:03.540 --> 54:05.247
...to re-download those apps?

54:06.509 --> 54:09.513
You are right.
I had not thought of that. Thank you.

54:09.679 --> 54:11.818
Oh, God, it's not always about you, Stu!

54:12.182 --> 54:13.889
It's locating.

54:16.453 --> 54:18.831
- Oh, God, of course.
- What?

54:19.322 --> 54:20.630
Where is he?

54:22.792 --> 54:24.328
He's in fucking Vegas.

54:24.494 --> 54:26.974
- Shotgun.
- Oh.

54:29.499 --> 54:31.479
Oh, no.

54:32.068 --> 54:33.672
Hey, Stu?

54:36.840 --> 54:39.719
I don't enjoy talking to you that way.

54:39.876 --> 54:43.289
I don't know why you insist
on making me blow my top.

54:43.647 --> 54:46.127
We've been on a lot of
adventures together...

54:46.283 --> 54:48.661
...but it seems like you haven't
learned anything.

54:48.818 --> 54:50.195
Anything!

54:51.488 --> 54:52.626
You think on it.

54:53.690 --> 54:55.431
I'll be in the limo.

54:57.394 --> 54:58.998
He's okay.

55:37.934 --> 55:42.007
Someone needs to burn this place
to the ground.

55:43.940 --> 55:46.944
I told myself I would never come back.

55:48.078 --> 55:49.785
Well, don't worry.

55:49.946 --> 55:51.983
It all ends tonight.

55:59.622 --> 56:02.603
It says 200 yards up on the right.

56:04.094 --> 56:06.199
And there it is.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.740
Amazing.

56:18.975 --> 56:20.784
Looks like he ditched it.

56:23.747 --> 56:25.488
- It's open.
- No shit.

56:25.648 --> 56:27.252
Well, look around.

56:27.417 --> 56:29.658
Let's see if he left anything in here.

56:32.255 --> 56:35.065
- I found the Demerol.
- Good. Keep it, we're gonna need it.

56:35.225 --> 56:38.638
I got my phone. No fucking keys, though.

56:38.795 --> 56:41.935
- Alan, anything?
- No, not even the gold.

56:43.800 --> 56:47.441
- Why the fuck would Chow come down here?
- I know, right?

56:48.071 --> 56:49.141
Why here?

56:51.107 --> 56:53.883
<i>You can't match
the pure strength and power...</i>

56:54.043 --> 56:55.579
<i>...of John Cena!</i>

56:56.146 --> 56:58.148
<i>- Cena puts Punk down!</i>
- Oh! Ha, ha.

56:58.314 --> 56:59.725
Nice!

57:02.619 --> 57:04.895
Excuse me.
Have you happened to see the driver...

57:05.054 --> 57:07.591
...of that minivan that's out front?
Short Asian guy?

57:07.757 --> 57:09.065
Yeah, they're all short.

57:09.225 --> 57:11.831
Ha, ha. That's so true.

57:11.995 --> 57:15.943
Right, but he may have been trying
to pawn some gold.

57:16.299 --> 57:18.142
That would be my business, wouldn't it?

57:19.669 --> 57:21.376
I like your T-shirt.

57:24.741 --> 57:26.914
I saw that show at the Forum.

57:27.644 --> 57:29.487
He played "Captain Jack."

57:30.413 --> 57:32.256
Yeah, I heard that was legendary.

57:32.415 --> 57:33.860
Woman...

57:34.017 --> 57:35.690
...you have no idea.

57:35.852 --> 57:37.388
Try me.

57:40.723 --> 57:44.364
Cassie, I'm hungry.
I thought you ordered Chinese.

57:44.928 --> 57:46.373
Mom, I'm with a customer!

57:46.529 --> 57:49.339
- You'll eat when I say it's time to eat!
- But the doctor...

57:49.499 --> 57:52.378
If you don't reverse that right now,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

57:58.174 --> 57:59.380
She's rude.

57:59.542 --> 58:00.885
Thank you.

58:01.044 --> 58:03.251
Yeah, you hear that, Ma? Nobody likes you!

58:03.413 --> 58:04.687
Yeah, keep your mouth shut!

58:04.848 --> 58:06.384
Whoa.

58:08.384 --> 58:09.829
You're smart.

58:18.194 --> 58:20.572
A Chinese guy came in here earlier.

58:20.730 --> 58:22.403
It was pretty weird.

58:22.565 --> 58:24.408
He pawned a gold brick.

58:24.567 --> 58:27.070
The thing's worth 400 grand,
he took 18,000.

58:27.237 --> 58:31.447
- Did he say where he was going?
- I'm sorry, was I talking to you?

58:37.413 --> 58:38.949
He said he wanted three things:

58:39.115 --> 58:42.119
He wanted some girls,
some guys and some bath salts.

58:42.285 --> 58:46.028
I gave him a card for an escort service
and he took off.

58:48.725 --> 58:52.730
Pretty high-end,
so good luck getting anything out of them.

58:53.096 --> 58:54.769
Thank you.

59:49.452 --> 59:50.988
We gotta go. We should go.

59:51.154 --> 59:52.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.187
I'll get it, I'll get it. I'll get it.

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:41.738
Anything?

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.383
No, I'm still on hold.

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:48.385
Oh, look how happy this fucking guy is.

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:52.253
Have you ever witnessed a moment
with that much heat?

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:54.486
I mean, white-hot heat, bro!

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:56.458
No, it was pretty intense.

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:57.723
Yeah!

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.259
Yeah, it's actually an emergency.

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.869
He has a thick Asian accent.

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.395
I totally get it...

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:08.440
...but this is a highly
unusual circumstance and...

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.610
Okay. All right.

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:13.605
It's an escort service.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.545
They're not gonna tell us shit.

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.447
Maybe an escort would.

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.391
- You still have her number?
- Yeah, but...

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.225
...it'd be pretty awkward.

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.864
It's all we got.

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:37.368
She smiled at me again,
from inside the shop.

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:42.205
Ha, ha. This is the best day of my life.

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.341
Hey!

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:47.344
Oh, my God, you guys.

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:49.744
It's been so long.

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.612
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:54.550
- You look great.
- So do you! You're pregnant.

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.015
I feel so fat.

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.214
Oh, please.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.020
Do you guys mind taking your shoes off?
I'm a germ freak.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.526
- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.124
Alan.

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.327
Alan, what are you doing?

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.431
Sorry.

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:14.537
- Wow, you have a great house.
- Thank you.

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:16.973
I got married a year ago to a surgeon.

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:19.704
- Another doctor, can you believe it?
- Another doctor.

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.882
His name's Jeff. You guys would love him.

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.280
Tyler, say hi to Mommy's friends.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:25.776
Hi.

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.114
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.017
Wait, is that the baby?

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.522
Yeah, time flies, huh?

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:32.784
Wow.

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:36.294
Jade is there a place we could talk
that's a little bit more private?

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.557
Let's go in the kitchen.
You guys want coffee?

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:39.859
Perfect.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.999
Hey. you coming?

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.471
Is it okay if I go say
hello to the little guy?

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.234
Of course.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.321
Nice stuff.

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:14.300
Thanks. Jeff bought it for me.

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:17.465
Jeff. Who's that, your fake dad?

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.809
Your name was Carlos once.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.503
Did you know that?

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.841
No.

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:29.483
Well, it was.

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:32.118
And, frankly, it suits you better.

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:33.379
Okay.

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:41.091
Do you remember me?

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:43.530
No.

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:51.572
Are you my real dad?

01:03:58.635 --> 01:03:59.841
Yes.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:03.917
I don't know. You gotta understand, I've
been out of that world a few years now.

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.486
Yeah, of course. We totally get that.

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:09.487
I mean, Jeff knows everything
and he's cool, but...

01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:11.717
We're just asking if you can call around...

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:14.226
...just find out if anybody
might know where he is.

01:04:15.586 --> 01:04:18.123
We could really use your help.

01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:22.067
You used to love it
when I would carry you around.

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:25.139
Sometimes I can still feel your little head
on my chest.

01:04:29.266 --> 01:04:31.405
So do you like this new Jeff guy?

01:04:31.802 --> 01:04:33.509
Yeah, he's nice.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:36.549
My dad was nice too.
We did everything together.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:39.680
He was my life partner, heh.

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:46.923
I really let him down.

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:51.088
Okay. Wow.

01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:57.166
Just trust me, you don't want to go
over there, okay? Not this one.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:58.829
I love you too.

01:04:59.796 --> 01:05:01.776
She says there's this crazy Chinese guy...

01:05:01.932 --> 01:05:04.811
...and he's holed up in the penthouse suite
of Caesars Palace.

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.676
There's girls going in and out,
drugs everywhere...

01:05:07.838 --> 01:05:09.943
It sounds like a bad scene.

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:11.814
Hey, Alan?

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:13.778
We gotta go.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:18.483
I gotta go, little man.

01:05:18.649 --> 01:05:20.458
It was great talking to you.

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:22.993
High five.

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:29.303
- It's great to see you.
- You too, Jade.

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:31.439
- Thanks so much for your help.
- Yeah.

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:33.131
That's a great kid you got there.

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:34.742
He is the best.

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:36.172
Alan.

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:56.423
Oh, hold on. I have something for you.

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:04.428
Perfect.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:05.800
Oh, please.

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:08.307
I'll see you around, Carlos.

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:14.315
- Yeah.
<i>- We got him.</i>

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.281
- Great. Where is he?
<i>- Caesars Palace.</i>

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.853
Change of plans.
Tell him we're going to Vegas.

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:21.889
I'm on my way.

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:23.752
There's a spot just outside of town.

01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:26.724
<i>I'll text you the details.
Be there at 6 a.m.</i>

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:28.988
And make sure the little fucker's tied up.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.392
We don't have him.

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.295
Hey, Marshall, it's Phil.

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:33.628
Maybe Stu wasn't clear.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.794
We don't actually have Chow,
we just know where he is.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.338
Yeah, and we were hoping
that you and your guys...

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:43.444
<i>- ...could go to Caesars and get him.</i>
- I don't give a fuck what you were hoping.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.443
<i>The deal is you bring Chow to me.</i>

01:06:45.602 --> 01:06:48.981
- Oh, fuck.
- 6 a.m. Or your friend is dead.

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:54.916
Shit.

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:02.194
Oh, God.

01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:04.024
This place gives me the chills.

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:06.095
I know, right?

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:08.595
It's great to be back.

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:11.239
- So many good memories.
- Are you kidding me?

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:13.165
Okay, so here's the deal:

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:15.401
You need a key just to get onto his floor.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:18.671
And then once you're there,
he's got security posted at the door.

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:20.337
It's ridiculous.

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:22.450
Let me guess, that's him?

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:27.382
Yep.
The one with the strobe lights.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:30.220
I got an idea.

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:33.457
But you're not gonna like it.

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:36.695
It's not gonna work.

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:38.628
Not with that fucking attitude.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.828
You know this whole place
is made out of marbles?

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:48.968
Come on. Go, go, go.

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:57.050
<i>After we stick Chow, Alan and I are
gonna take him down through the lobby.</i>

01:07:57.207 --> 01:08:00.711
Be waiting in valet.
Engine running, ready to go.

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:02.550
Are you sure about this?

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:03.918
Give me the Demerol.

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:06.654
See you in 20 minutes.

01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:07.921
- Hey, Phil?
- Yeah?

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:09.120
Don't die.

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:46.629
All right.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:48.932
Are you ready to do this?

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.571
Yeah.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.462
Wait, what are we doing?

01:08:58.135 --> 01:08:59.944
Holy shit.

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:07.683
We're gonna climb down...

01:09:08.545 --> 01:09:11.685
...and then it's about an 8-foot drop
to the balcony.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.459
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:22.734
No, you spit in your own hand.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.600
Oh, yeah.

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:37.881
Dry desert air.

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:41.011
- Alan, it's fine. You don't need it.
- Okay.

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:57.703
Oh, God.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.446
- Unh!
- Careful!

01:10:08.138 --> 01:10:09.446
- Phil!
- I'm all right.

01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:12.851
I'm okay!

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.248
- Hey, Phil.
- What's wrong?

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:16.550
Hold on a second.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.021
- What?
- Hold on!

01:10:18.181 --> 01:10:20.388
Like, kick yourself out a little bit.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:21.620
Alan.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:23.162
- Stay still!
- Alan!

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:25.591
Did you get it?

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.757
No. Hold on.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.531
Ha, that's cool, ha-ha-ha.

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:40.880
Oh! Fuck me!

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:44.476
Everything all right?

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:47.021
It's okay!

01:10:47.177 --> 01:10:48.417
It's all right!

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:50.956
I got it! Whoa.

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:55.888
Are you okay?

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:09.301
Alan, it's your turn.

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:15.514
That's it.

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:17.241
Phil, I can't. I can't.

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:18.442
Come on.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.092
Whoa!

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:26.522
Alan, you all right?

01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:27.957
Phil, call Security!

01:11:28.151 --> 01:11:31.098
- I think it's slipping!
- Just hold on!

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:32.692
Oh! God!

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:34.858
- You need to calm down.
- I'm slipping, Phil!

01:11:37.193 --> 01:11:38.536
Oh! Fuck!

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.965
Oh, shit! You okay?

01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:45.476
Help!

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:50.616
Oh, no.

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:55.216
I'm gonna die, Phil.

01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:57.949
No, you're fine. Just...

01:11:59.215 --> 01:12:00.888
Drop down to me.

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:02.720
No chance.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.956
I'm good up here.

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:07.829
Alan, you can do this. I'll catch you.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:11.267
Just...

01:12:12.696 --> 01:12:13.800
...let go.

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:24.908
That's it. That's it.
Just drop straight down.

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:27.581
But don't push off.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:29.717
No!

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:32.522
- Oh, God!
- Come here!

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.622
Holy fuck!

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.094
You okay?

01:12:38.254 --> 01:12:39.289
Yeah.

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:41.663
Shit. Oh, fuck.

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:44.930
I almost died, Phil.

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:49.269
Come on. I wasn't gonna let you go.
You're my boy.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.812
And you're my man.

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:55.116
Alan, what are you doing? Alan.

01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.648
Okay.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:02.490
Let's go get this fucker.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.370
Hey!

01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:27.039
Have you seen my...?

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:28.341
Huh?

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:56.108
Phil!

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.636
Motherfuckers!

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:00.739
Grab the gun!

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:08.016
- Oh, fuck!
- Phil!

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:09.213
Oh.

01:14:09.379 --> 01:14:10.858
Phil, you okay?

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:13.452
Chow!

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:18.956
Chow!

01:14:20.557 --> 01:14:22.332
Chow, open the fucking door!

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.233
Fuck.

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:33.707
Chow, stop.

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:34.940
You motherfuckers!

01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:38.278
Leslie, get down from there! Please!
You're gonna hurt yourself!

01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:39.886
Nothing hurts Chow.

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:41.954
I am invisible!

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:46.420
It's "invincible," and you're not.
You're just out of your fucking mind.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.756
Now get down from there before you die!

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:50.329
Die?

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:54.958
How do you kill what's already dead?
Heh-heh-heh.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:56.795
Oh, fuck!

01:14:58.094 --> 01:14:59.937
Holy...

01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:03.533
Woo-hoo!

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:08.276
- Hey. You okay?
<i>- No.</i>

01:15:08.438 --> 01:15:09.576
<i>Look up.</i>

01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:13.287
What the fuck is that?

01:15:13.443 --> 01:15:15.081
- That's Chow!
- What?

01:15:15.245 --> 01:15:16.690
Follow him.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.085
Woo-hoo!

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:23.954
Whoo!

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:27.869
I love cocaine!

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:30.969
Out of the way!

01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:34.534
How did this happen?

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.608
<i>We had him trapped,
and then he jumped!</i>

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:38.336
He's out of his fucking mind!

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:40.978
I'm out of my fucking mind!

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:45.550
Wow.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:49.554
So beautiful.

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:53.255
Stu, do not lose him.

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:54.622
I'm trying.

01:15:56.119 --> 01:15:57.564
Whoa!

01:15:59.856 --> 01:16:01.836
Oh, shit.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:05.698
<i>I believe I can fly</i>

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:10.208
<i>I believe I can touch the sky</i>

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:14.877
<i>Think about it every night and day</i>

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.845
We gotta pack up all this gold.
We're taking it with us.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.487
Talk to me, Stu.

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:22.088
I got him.

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:23.417
Ha, ha. I got him!

01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:25.119
Oh, shit!

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:31.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:33.834
Shit.

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:36.938
Fuck! I lost him!

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.198
Don't tell me that. You can't lose him!

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:41.842
This is so much harder
than you realize, Phil.

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:43.568
I'm just a dentist!

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:47.410
No, Stu, you're a fucking doctor.
Now go get him.

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:55.552
Where the fuck did he go?

01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:59.594
Fuck me!

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:01.695
I should have thought this through!

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:03.121
Shit!

01:17:04.487 --> 01:17:05.591
Move!

01:17:07.457 --> 01:17:08.993
- Aah!
- Stu?

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:11.331
- Chow?
- Stop the fucking car!

01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:14.475
- Stu.
- I can't! The pedal is stuck!

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.871
- What?
- Stu?

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.344
- I can't see!
- Stop, motherfucker!

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:22.644
- Get off!
- Pull over!

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.580
- It won't stop!
- Aah!

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.414
Get off the car!

01:17:26.576 --> 01:17:28.214
I can't see anything!

01:17:28.378 --> 01:17:29.857
Ha-ha-ha. We're gonna die finally.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:43.099
Holy shit.

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:45.063
<i>Stu? Stu, what happened?</i>

01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:48.408
<i>Stu, what's going on?</i>

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:51.344
We had an accident,
and I think he's dead.

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:52.877
<i>Wait, what?</i>

01:17:53.036 --> 01:17:55.107
I think I killed him.

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:02.146
Holy shit.

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.093
He's not moving.

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.854
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.290
Mr. Chow?

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:20.172
Chow.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.835
Stuart?

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:27.644
He's alive. He's okay.

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:28.942
Oh, great.

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:32.018
Put him in the limo and come get us.
We'll meet you at valet.

01:18:32.175 --> 01:18:33.483
Yeah, okay.

01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:35.817
Stu.

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:38.486
That was some ride, huh, pal?

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:40.491
Yeah, it was pretty wild.

01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:42.663
I can't feel my nuts.

01:18:43.453 --> 01:18:46.161
Would you rub them
and make sure they okay?

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:49.768
It's over, Leslie.

01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:56.303
Wait.

01:18:56.632 --> 01:18:58.475
Let's make a deal.

01:18:59.168 --> 01:19:01.205
Want Chow to blow your dick?

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:05.316
Come on, Stu.

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.822
I could be a good wife to you.

01:19:10.813 --> 01:19:12.815
- No more deals.
- No, wait!

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:32.003
Let's put the bags in the back seat.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:33.647
Trunk's full.

01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:52.297
Hey, guys? I'm feeling better now.

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:55.901
All right, it's the next exit,
then four miles straight into the desert.

01:19:57.693 --> 01:20:01.505
Let me out, we split the gold four ways.
Everyone wins.

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:06.240
Marshall gonna kill me!

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:08.313
My blood will be on your hands!

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:12.552
You want Chow's ghost haunting you
for rest of your life, Stu?

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:15.120
Floating over you while you make fuck
on your wife?

01:20:15.278 --> 01:20:18.122
He's not gonna kill you, Chow!
He just wants his gold back!

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:22.423
It's gone. I blew the first
20 million in Bangkok.

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:26.260
- That's why I had to get the other half.
- Enough, Chow! It's over!

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:27.958
You motherfucker!

01:20:28.124 --> 01:20:31.230
When I get out of this,
I'm gonna rip out your fucking lungs!

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:34.375
You hear me? You're dead! You're all dead!

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:38.710
I didn't mean that.

01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:41.345
Chow loses temper sometimes.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:44.280
Please. I need help.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.680
I know that now.

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:49.716
That's the exit.

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:12.137
They're here.

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:17.083
Alan, they're coming, grab the last bag.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.878
Please, Alan.

01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:46.071
Doug!

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.044
Step away from the bags. Let's go!

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.277
We good?

01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:56.548
- It's all there. I promise.
- Not exactly.

01:21:56.712 --> 01:21:59.022
I'm still missing the original half.

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:03.891
But, no, that's all we have. Chow said
he blew the other half in Bangkok.

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:06.664
Where is he?

01:22:08.057 --> 01:22:09.536
He's in the trunk.

01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:12.702
Deal's a deal.

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:15.769
- Doug.
- Give me the keys.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:22.749
What are you gonna do with Chow?

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:25.209
I just wanna talk to him.

01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:27.148
Move.

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:30.322
You all right?

01:22:35.017 --> 01:22:36.621
What the fuck?

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.659
End of conversation.

01:22:40.756 --> 01:22:42.793
Why would you do that?

01:22:43.059 --> 01:22:46.063
Leslie Chow is madness.

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.104
You don't talk to madness.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:52.178
If you're lucky, you trap it in the trunk
of your limo and you kill it.

01:22:53.769 --> 01:22:55.976
You did a great thing tonight.

01:22:56.205 --> 01:22:58.446
You should feel good about this.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.993
What the fuck?
You think this is a fucking game?

01:23:07.883 --> 01:23:08.953
Don't, don't, don't!

01:23:09.118 --> 01:23:10.426
Oh, shit!

01:23:11.287 --> 01:23:13.198
Toodle-loo, motherfuckers.

01:23:24.934 --> 01:23:26.038
Chow.

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:29.609
Chow. Chow, wait.

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:32.013
Oh, now you wanna talk, blue eyes?

01:23:32.208 --> 01:23:34.210
No more silent treatment?

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:36.254
Leslie. No.

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.181
Stay out of this, fatty.

01:23:40.449 --> 01:23:41.928
No, Leslie.

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:50.468
You shoot Phil, you gotta go through me.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:51.932
What?

01:23:59.435 --> 01:24:01.472
- Alan.
- Quiet.

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:03.548
I'm in a stare-off.

01:24:12.148 --> 01:24:13.684
Today you all live.

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:17.060
Because one of you was a friend.

01:24:19.889 --> 01:24:21.835
Alan, what did you do?

01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:25.699
I unlocked the latch
between the back seat and the trunk.

01:24:27.496 --> 01:24:29.407
And left him his gun?

01:24:30.466 --> 01:24:32.537
Yeah, I didn't think it
all the way through.

01:24:33.002 --> 01:24:35.004
He gave Chow a fighting chance.

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:38.514
That's all I ever need.

01:24:42.078 --> 01:24:43.386
Fat fuck.

01:24:48.818 --> 01:24:50.126
It's never easy, is it?

01:24:50.653 --> 01:24:52.223
No one wants to see that.

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:55.225
Except for me, but I was born bad.

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:57.800
Hold on. I have something for you.

01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:01.667
For your loyalty.

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:10.149
- Oh, no, I don't want this, Mr. Chow.
- Okay, give it back, then. Come on.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:13.314
Quick! Before Stu smells it.

01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:15.946
I don't want it either, Chow.

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:18.251
Oh, please.
Like a squirrel doesn't want a nut.

01:25:19.915 --> 01:25:22.589
It funny because he's Jewish.

01:25:25.588 --> 01:25:27.067
Don't you get it?

01:25:34.597 --> 01:25:36.235
Goddamn it.

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:41.407
Okay, go on. Get out of here, all of you.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:49.919
Hey, chubster, I'll call you in a week.
We'll get together.

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:57.289
No, Leslie, we can't be friends anymore.

01:25:57.453 --> 01:25:58.523
What?

01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:02.395
You're not good for me. It's not healthy.

01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:05.471
Alan, you're not thinking straight.

01:26:06.295 --> 01:26:07.797
Let's just talk tomorrow.

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:11.845
Leslie, you're one of the coolest
and nicest guys I've ever met.

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:15.175
And you're smart and you're funny
and everybody loves you.

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:17.214
Alan. What is this?

01:26:19.008 --> 01:26:22.012
When we get together,
bad things happen and people get hurt.

01:26:22.178 --> 01:26:25.159
Yeah, that's the point. It's funny.

01:26:26.081 --> 01:26:29.358
Well, I've gotta make some changes
in my life, and this is one of them.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.999
I'm sorry.

01:26:37.426 --> 01:26:39.201
Farewell, Leslie Chow.

01:26:53.576 --> 01:26:55.283
You're cold as ice.

01:26:57.413 --> 01:26:58.551
Shotgun.

01:28:00.976 --> 01:28:02.819
Everybody okay?

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:05.959
Yeah.

01:28:06.582 --> 01:28:08.789
Alan, you okay?

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:10.995
Yeah.

01:28:14.256 --> 01:28:16.497
Good. Let's go home.

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:36.085
Jesus Christ.

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:44.455
You know what, guys?

01:28:45.421 --> 01:28:48.493
You can go ahead without me.
There's something I need to do.

01:28:50.592 --> 01:28:52.572
Do you even know how to get home?

01:28:54.763 --> 01:28:56.674
Of course I do. I'm a grown man.

01:28:56.832 --> 01:28:58.470
I'll ask a stranger.

01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:03.641
Good luck, Alan.

01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:07.948
We'll see you soon.

01:29:40.175 --> 01:29:43.122
Did you know that just a couple blocks
from here...

01:29:43.278 --> 01:29:46.282
...there's a place that looks exactly
like Paris, France?

01:29:47.216 --> 01:29:50.925
I can't remember what it's called,
but it's supposed to be magnificent.

01:29:51.086 --> 01:29:53.896
It's called Paris Hotel and Casino,
and it is magnificent.

01:29:54.089 --> 01:29:55.159
Yeah, that's it.

01:29:55.324 --> 01:29:58.362
Well, I'd like to take you to dinner there.
Tonight.

01:29:58.961 --> 01:30:01.032
Oh, sorry. No can do.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:03.205
Oh, well...

01:30:03.365 --> 01:30:05.572
I'm banned from the casino for life.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:07.407
Plus 10 years.

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:10.882
I took Mom there for her birthday,
played a little blackjack.

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:12.074
She split 10s.

01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:14.278
- Oh.
- I may have overreacted.

01:30:14.443 --> 01:30:16.252
They said it was abuse of an elderly.

01:30:16.412 --> 01:30:17.891
Ha, ha. I've done that.

01:30:18.046 --> 01:30:20.219
Heh. Right? Whatever.

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:22.293
I can't go back there.

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:27.264
But, uh...

01:30:27.423 --> 01:30:32.270
...Golden Nugget has the best prime rib
in town, if that's...

01:30:34.696 --> 01:30:36.642
Well, that sounds glorious.

01:30:37.566 --> 01:30:39.102
I'll send for you at 8:00.

01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:47.479
Is that it?

01:31:24.947 --> 01:31:27.188
I saw it once in a pornography.

01:31:27.483 --> 01:31:28.826
Oh.

01:31:29.117 --> 01:31:30.653
It's a nice gesture.

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:32.321
But maybe we should wait.

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:33.891
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

01:31:41.296 --> 01:31:42.741
I'll see you at 8.

01:32:07.756 --> 01:32:09.667
You look great, Alan.

01:32:10.726 --> 01:32:13.070
What do you think? Hat or no hat?

01:32:13.228 --> 01:32:14.468
Uh...

01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:16.871
- Hat. For sure.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:32:18.133 --> 01:32:20.272
Wow. Who's this guy?

01:32:20.435 --> 01:32:22.608
The vest and the cane? I love it.

01:32:22.771 --> 01:32:24.717
Thank you. Cassie picked it out for me.

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:26.352
You look like Mr. Peanut.

01:32:26.508 --> 01:32:29.045
Yeah, I know, right?
That's what I was going for.

01:32:29.645 --> 01:32:31.886
- Maybe we'll just lose it.
- Yeah.

01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:35.051
Hey, Alan, I was just talking to Cassie.
She's an amazing woman.

01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:37.787
Oh, thank you for saying that.
She is an amazing woman.

01:32:37.953 --> 01:32:39.899
I find her much better than your wives.

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:41.295
Aw. That's sweet.

01:32:41.456 --> 01:32:45.063
Which reminds me.
Um, we need to talk. Doug?

01:32:47.663 --> 01:32:49.336
All right, listen, fellas.

01:32:49.498 --> 01:32:53.378
Now that I'm getting married, I'm gonna be
spending a lot more time with Cassandra.

01:32:53.535 --> 01:32:57.210
- Yeah. It's the way it should be.
- No, you slow your roll, Phil, okay?

01:32:57.372 --> 01:32:58.407
There's more.

01:32:58.574 --> 01:33:00.554
And you're not gonna like this part.

01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:06.523
I must resign from the wolf pack.

01:33:09.418 --> 01:33:12.558
Wow, that's a big step, Alan.

01:33:12.721 --> 01:33:13.756
I know.

01:33:14.222 --> 01:33:16.168
But she's my soul mate.

01:33:16.325 --> 01:33:18.134
And my new best friend.

01:33:19.061 --> 01:33:21.564
Plus, she lets me mount her...

01:33:21.997 --> 01:33:23.305
...which relaxes me.

01:33:23.498 --> 01:33:24.670
Oh, my God.

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:27.905
Alan, maybe never say that part again.

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:30.072
Chillax, Doug, we're all adults here.

01:33:30.238 --> 01:33:32.684
I know you mount my sister.
I've seen it. Many times.

01:33:33.175 --> 01:33:34.552
What?

01:33:35.077 --> 01:33:36.181
Alan, you are the best.

01:33:36.345 --> 01:33:37.619
The point is:

01:33:37.813 --> 01:33:39.087
You need to let me go.

01:33:39.448 --> 01:33:40.859
You in particular.

01:33:41.016 --> 01:33:42.689
I can't be your hero anymore.

01:33:44.186 --> 01:33:46.097
Okay. Sure.

01:33:51.927 --> 01:33:53.270
Having said all that...

01:33:53.428 --> 01:33:56.466
...I still would like to get together
on Tuesdays for bowling...

01:33:56.632 --> 01:33:59.806
...and alternating Sundays
for general horseplay.

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:02.778
- How about we play all that by ear?
- Alan, it's time.

01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:04.144
Here we go.

01:34:04.706 --> 01:34:06.185
Ready?

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:14.255
I'm ready.

01:36:01.857 --> 01:36:03.632
What the fuck?

01:36:05.894 --> 01:36:06.929
Oh.

01:36:15.203 --> 01:36:16.682
Oh, my God.

01:36:17.172 --> 01:36:18.515
You guys.

01:36:18.673 --> 01:36:21.051
We're so crazy.

01:36:22.043 --> 01:36:25.456
I'm wearing women's underwear. Ha-ha-ha.

01:36:25.614 --> 01:36:28.151
Oh, my God. Ha-ha-ha.

01:36:28.683 --> 01:36:31.789
Stu, don't freak out,
but you need to look down.

01:36:32.888 --> 01:36:34.367
What?

01:36:36.792 --> 01:36:38.430
Oh, my God!

01:36:41.363 --> 01:36:43.775
Ho-ho-ho.
- Aah!

01:36:45.767 --> 01:36:47.576
Oh, fuck!

01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:50.443
I have boobies now!

01:36:50.605 --> 01:36:51.640
Holy shit!

01:36:51.807 --> 01:36:53.150
It's not funny!

01:36:54.009 --> 01:36:56.216
Alan, what did you do?

01:36:57.112 --> 01:36:58.921
What did you do, Alan?

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.559
The wedding cake.

01:37:00.715 --> 01:37:01.955
It was from Leslie.

01:37:03.819 --> 01:37:04.923
Oh, my God.

01:37:05.086 --> 01:37:07.999
We had a sick night, bitches. Heh-heh-heh.

01:37:08.305 --> 01:37:14.929
