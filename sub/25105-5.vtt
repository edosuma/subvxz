<i>Reverie:
a virtual reality program</i>

00:05.930 --> 00:08.898
<i>Anything you desire,
you can find here.</i>

00:08.934 --> 00:11.634
<i>But sometimes people get lost.</i>

00:11.670 --> 00:14.403
<i>Caught between fantasy
and reality.</i>

00:14.439 --> 00:15.839
<i>That's where she comes in.</i>

00:15.875 --> 00:18.441
<i>Her name is Mara Kint.</i>

00:18.477 --> 00:22.444
<i>Her job: find the lost ones
and bring them home.</i>

00:22.480 --> 00:24.848
<i>And maybe by saving them,</i>

00:24.884 --> 00:27.717
<i>she just might find a way
to save herself.</i>

<i>Previously on "Reverie"...</i>

00:38.898 --> 00:40.529
When you find this symbol
in Reverie,

00:40.565 --> 00:41.731
you're looking
at a gateway icon.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.432
Your exit back
to the real world.

00:43.468 --> 00:44.633
<i>Charlie, we're running
out of time.</i>

00:44.669 --> 00:46.703
- <i>Is she ready or not?</i>
- Yes.

00:46.739 --> 00:48.605
- <i>She's ready.</i>
- <i>Then send her in.</i>

00:48.641 --> 00:50.472
And how does
the Department of Defense

00:50.508 --> 00:52.609
see our product working
for them in the future?

00:52.645 --> 00:54.380
We see potential.

01:02.221 --> 01:03.953
Folks, empty your pockets.

01:03.989 --> 01:06.489
Take the laptops
out of your bags.

01:10.796 --> 01:12.629
Step forward, sir.

01:12.665 --> 01:13.963
Step on through.

01:13.999 --> 01:15.564
Here you go.

01:16.802 --> 01:17.867
Thank you.

01:24.977 --> 01:26.876
Raise your arms, sir.

01:29.681 --> 01:30.814
Can I see your ID, please?

01:30.850 --> 01:34.483
Any keys, cell phones,
wallets...

01:34.519 --> 01:36.618
Raise your arms,

01:36.654 --> 01:37.921
shoulder height.

01:41.227 --> 01:45.561
Okay, sir, come on.
Step through.

01:45.597 --> 01:47.796
Yes. I'm calling to let
Mr. Wiggins know

01:47.832 --> 01:49.998
I'm running a little late.

01:50.034 --> 01:51.603
Yes.

02:09.988 --> 02:11.724
Mara.

02:13.826 --> 02:15.725
Did you make a new friend?

02:15.761 --> 02:17.760
I need you to come with me.

02:17.796 --> 02:21.034
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in my office.

02:26.871 --> 02:28.637
I'm sure this must seem odd,

02:28.673 --> 02:30.572
but I'll get you up
to speed quickly.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.843
Just couldn't talk until we
were all in a secure location.

02:33.879 --> 02:35.244
Monica, before we do this,

02:35.280 --> 02:36.613
I'd like to speak
with you privately.

02:36.649 --> 02:37.914
I'm afraid we can't, Charlie.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.715
- There's no time.
- Okay, I don't understand

02:39.751 --> 02:41.518
I thought you were an investor
in Onira-Tech.

02:41.554 --> 02:43.052
You work for the army?

02:43.088 --> 02:45.787
Defense Department,
which is an investor.

02:45.823 --> 02:48.057
We own 30% of Onira-Tech.

02:48.093 --> 02:51.293
Anyone here surprised
to hear that?

02:51.329 --> 02:54.964
I was told we operated
independent of our financing.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.698
Of course you do.

02:56.734 --> 02:58.101
I'm just asking for your help.

02:58.137 --> 03:01.738
- With what?
- Preventing a terror attack.

03:01.774 --> 03:03.810
In here, please.

03:06.111 --> 03:08.744
Five hours ago a bomb exploded

03:08.780 --> 03:10.046
in the lobby
of the Mercodyne building

03:10.082 --> 03:11.581
in West Los Angeles.

03:14.018 --> 03:17.820
The causality count right now
is 63 killed, 22 injured.

03:17.856 --> 03:19.589
Why this building?

03:19.625 --> 03:21.558
Probably
the military connection.

03:21.594 --> 03:23.726
A lot of contractors
have their offices there.

03:23.762 --> 03:26.629
Someone calling himself Silas
sent us this

03:26.665 --> 03:29.766
45 minutes after the event.

03:29.802 --> 03:32.000
<i>Did we get
your attention? Good.</i>

03:32.036 --> 03:33.769
<i>Because the people
of Doyle County</i>

03:33.805 --> 03:35.672
<i>did not ask to be
your dumping ground.</i>

03:35.708 --> 03:37.974
<i>But you still buried
your guns and munitions here.</i>

03:38.010 --> 03:40.577
<i>You depleted
uranium shell casings.</i>

03:40.613 --> 03:42.111
<i>Now the groundwater
is poisoned.</i>

03:42.147 --> 03:45.047
<i>Dozens have died,
and more are dying every day.</i>

03:45.083 --> 03:47.784
<i>And why? So you can
greedily buy more?</i>

03:47.820 --> 03:49.319
<i>Keep the corporate machine
humming?</i>

03:49.355 --> 03:51.087
<i>Pay reparations,</i>

03:51.123 --> 03:53.889
<i>relocate the town's people,
and clean up the site.</i>

03:53.925 --> 03:57.927
<i>Or we will visit upon you
days and days of reckoning.</i>

04:00.833 --> 04:03.933
We believe this is the first
in a series of attacks.

04:03.969 --> 04:06.602
- So there are more bombs?
- Yes.

04:06.638 --> 04:08.137
- Call in the FBI.
- We have.

04:08.173 --> 04:11.073
And state and local police
and the NSA.

04:11.109 --> 04:13.676
But you can do something
none of them can.

04:13.712 --> 04:14.978
What?

04:15.014 --> 04:16.978
Talk to the only surviving
eyewitness.

04:17.015 --> 04:18.647
Time's short.

04:18.683 --> 04:19.916
I took the liberty
of having her

04:19.952 --> 04:22.055
transferred
to your medical wing.

04:24.423 --> 04:26.356
She's here?

04:26.392 --> 04:27.990
Her name is Denise Lang.

04:28.026 --> 04:29.726
She was one of the
security guards in the lobby

04:29.762 --> 04:31.060
when the device went off.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.728
And you think she can
identify Silas?

04:32.764 --> 04:34.697
According to the
surveillance footage,

04:34.733 --> 04:37.767
she and what appears
to be Silas cross paths

04:37.803 --> 04:39.401
minutes before the explosion.

04:39.437 --> 04:41.169
She definitely saw him.

04:41.205 --> 04:42.971
How badly was she hurt?

04:43.007 --> 04:45.108
Third-degree burns
over 60% of her body,

04:45.144 --> 04:47.844
lacerations to
her liver and spleen,

04:47.880 --> 04:49.411
and she's in a coma.

04:49.447 --> 04:52.981
Doctors are giving
her six to ten hours at best.

04:53.017 --> 04:54.750
You'll have to work fast.

04:54.786 --> 04:56.719
What? How? You just said
she's in a coma.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.154
- Exactly.
- Interesting.

04:59.190 --> 05:00.923
I'll need you to go
into her mind

05:00.959 --> 05:02.125
using the Reverie program

05:02.161 --> 05:04.192
to get an identification
of Silas.

05:04.228 --> 05:06.995
You want us
to <i>induce</i> a Reverie?

05:07.031 --> 05:08.930
Our people have looked
at the Reverie source code.

05:08.966 --> 05:11.067
They say there are
no significant obstacles.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.803
You have our source code?
Did you know about this?

05:13.839 --> 05:15.738
Did you... give it to her?

05:15.774 --> 05:17.707
This sounds dangerous,
Monica.

05:17.743 --> 05:19.942
Putting Mara into the mind
of a coma victim.

05:19.978 --> 05:22.211
Why? She goes into the brain
of sick people all the time.

05:22.247 --> 05:24.212
Yeah, this is different.
It's risky.

05:24.248 --> 05:25.781
I mean I don't even know
if we can do it.

05:25.817 --> 05:26.882
Oh, we can do it.

05:26.918 --> 05:28.250
The question is, should we?

05:28.286 --> 05:30.853
Why not? It's a great
technical challenge.

05:30.889 --> 05:32.755
And a perfect test case
for Reverie's expansion.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.757
- We don't have her consent.
- And we never will.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.459
She's dying.

05:37.495 --> 05:40.962
What happens if Mara goes in
and Denise dies?

05:40.998 --> 05:43.166
I don't know.
There's no precedent for this.

05:43.202 --> 05:46.034
I mean we do know that Reverie
can't exist without the mind.

05:46.070 --> 05:48.070
Then we're not sending
Mara in.

05:48.106 --> 05:51.873
Maybe she should speak
for herself.

05:51.909 --> 05:53.108
Mara?

05:53.144 --> 05:55.712
You're certain
there are more bombs?

05:55.748 --> 05:58.113
100%.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.817
You left these here
on purpose for me to see.

06:00.853 --> 06:02.255
Don't think I didn't know that.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.695
I'll go in.

06:11.269 --> 06:12.622
- Noradrenaline.
- Yup.

06:12.658 --> 06:14.104
It's all about
the noradrenaline.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.667
- What is noradrenaline?
- Dylan?

06:16.703 --> 06:18.865
<i>Noradrenaline is a hormone
that stimulates</i>

06:18.901 --> 06:20.737
<i>the amygdala,
where memories are formed.</i>

06:20.773 --> 06:22.673
The stress increases
noradrenaline.

06:22.709 --> 06:25.343
The more your brain makes,
the less you remember.

06:25.379 --> 06:27.644
But the right amount can help

06:27.680 --> 06:29.883
store memories leading up
to a traumatic event.

06:31.817 --> 06:33.718
If she has the memory
stored in her brain,

06:33.754 --> 06:35.686
we might be able to get her
to recall it

06:35.722 --> 06:36.987
through the Reverie program.

06:37.023 --> 06:38.588
We have the surveillance video.

06:38.624 --> 06:39.956
It shows us exactly
what happened.

06:39.992 --> 06:42.126
So if we use
the surveillance video

06:42.162 --> 06:43.860
as a blueprint for Denise,

06:43.896 --> 06:45.396
it'll be like a replay
of her memory.

06:45.432 --> 06:46.930
And creating this memory
will get her

06:46.966 --> 06:48.833
to remember Silas's face?

06:48.869 --> 06:52.703
Maybe. We can build the space
and an avatar of Silas.

06:52.739 --> 06:54.672
But she's the only one
who saw his face.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.107
We're hoping the Reverie
prompts her

06:56.143 --> 06:58.742
- to fill in the rest.
- Okay, so say she sees it.

06:58.778 --> 07:00.444
Then how do I?

07:00.480 --> 07:02.980
Each BCI links the client's
brain to the program.

07:03.016 --> 07:05.715
In Reverie 2.0, your brain is
connected with the program

07:05.751 --> 07:07.117
and the client's experience.

07:07.153 --> 07:09.119
We're hoping you see it
'cause she does.

07:09.155 --> 07:10.987
So I'm the sneaky neighbor
stealing the cable?

07:11.023 --> 07:12.790
That's one way to look at it.

07:12.826 --> 07:14.891
Her neural interface
is gonna go haywire.

07:14.927 --> 07:18.095
Everything's gonna be loopy:
Voice commands, visual data.

07:18.131 --> 07:19.864
I'll have to tweak the code.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.470
I'll get people started
building the lobby.

07:30.776 --> 07:32.776
So you're on board with this?

07:32.812 --> 07:34.011
Not really.

07:34.047 --> 07:35.045
I think it's an invasion
of privacy

07:35.081 --> 07:36.780
and a terrible precedent.

07:36.816 --> 07:39.417
Hey, I need everybody
in the studio right away.

07:39.453 --> 07:41.451
But if you're gonna go in,

07:41.487 --> 07:43.490
I want to be sure you're safe.

07:48.227 --> 07:49.927
All right, people, listen up.

07:49.963 --> 07:51.494
We've got an hour tops
to build this.

07:51.530 --> 07:53.196
So whatever you're doing,
stop.

07:53.232 --> 07:55.932
And no, Bruce, I can't tell you
what this is for.

07:55.968 --> 07:58.035
But as you may have guessed
from the men

07:58.071 --> 08:00.703
walking around
with very large guns,

08:00.739 --> 08:02.038
it's classified.

08:02.074 --> 08:03.674
<i>Paul, I'm placing
lobby blueprints</i>

08:03.710 --> 08:05.208
- <i>on your desktop.</i>
- Thank you, Dylan.

08:05.244 --> 08:06.876
And we have to match

08:06.912 --> 08:08.879
the security video
elements perfectly.

08:08.915 --> 08:11.949
<i>The program is pulling data
from a variety of sources.</i>

08:11.985 --> 08:16.787
<i>Staged architectural photos,
schematics, security video.</i>

08:16.823 --> 08:18.726
<i>Apertus.</i>

08:22.996 --> 08:24.894
<i>Since we only have
partial data</i>

08:24.930 --> 08:26.696
<i>on the people
who were in the lobby,</i>

08:26.732 --> 08:28.131
<i>you're gonna have to use
some imagination</i>

08:28.167 --> 08:30.203
<i>to render them 360.</i>

08:32.572 --> 08:34.738
You know what,
try a Pantone color

08:34.774 --> 08:36.907
in the 2390 range.

08:36.943 --> 08:39.009
<i>No calls, no texts, no emails.</i>

08:39.044 --> 08:41.110
<i>Nothing in or out
while we're working.</i>

08:41.145 --> 08:43.751
This is gonna require
us to dig deep.

08:47.887 --> 08:50.156
Well, that's gonna
need some work.

09:24.123 --> 09:25.922
We're all set.

09:25.958 --> 09:28.926
Your fail-safe Mandala is near
the primary location.

09:28.962 --> 09:30.994
The program will start
as soon as you enter.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.230
But it'll be a little
while until Silas appears.

09:33.266 --> 09:35.298
We've parachuted Denise
into the program

09:35.334 --> 09:37.768
to give her a bit more time
to find her bearings.

09:37.804 --> 09:40.104
Under no circumstances
mention the Reverie,

09:40.140 --> 09:41.871
her injuries,
anything that would

09:41.907 --> 09:43.573
lead her to think
what's happening isn't real.

09:43.609 --> 09:45.241
You'll threaten the connection
between the two of you.

09:45.277 --> 09:47.143
And probably freak her
the hell out.

09:47.179 --> 09:49.550
We don't want that.

09:52.184 --> 09:53.587
Mara.

09:55.854 --> 09:57.254
Just be careful in there. Okay?

09:57.290 --> 09:59.856
Careful's my middle name.

10:13.173 --> 10:15.142
<i>Apertus.</i>

10:24.383 --> 10:27.053
Oh, that's an awfully bright
exit icon.

10:33.059 --> 10:34.991
Oh.

10:35.027 --> 10:36.259
- Excuse me.
- Not a problem.

10:36.295 --> 10:38.598
Trudy, let's go.

10:54.314 --> 10:56.617
Which way do I go?

10:58.385 --> 11:00.888
Are you all right?

11:02.188 --> 11:04.321
I don't know.

11:04.357 --> 11:07.390
I feel so weird.

11:07.426 --> 11:10.360
Do you ever feel like
you're not in your own body?

11:10.396 --> 11:14.197
Well, I... I think we all
have those feelings.

11:14.233 --> 11:17.271
The day's got to get better
from here, right?

11:18.304 --> 11:19.973
Sure.

11:21.373 --> 11:23.407
Can I help you?

11:23.443 --> 11:25.375
Oh, um.

11:25.411 --> 11:29.013
No, I'm actually just waiting
for somebody.

11:29.049 --> 11:31.081
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

11:31.117 --> 11:33.187
Thanks.

11:44.764 --> 11:47.034
You said you wanted to talk.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.366
I had to ask
for Mara's help, Charlie.

11:50.402 --> 11:52.903
- We're trying to save lives.
- Don't give me that.

11:52.939 --> 11:55.172
You wanted Mara so you could
show off your new toy.

11:55.208 --> 11:58.142
Let your bosses at D.O.D.
see what they invested in.

11:58.178 --> 12:00.443
That's not true. We're in
the middle of a terror attack.

12:00.479 --> 12:02.680
I'm trying to contain it
before it becomes a disaster.

12:02.716 --> 12:05.315
And that means availing myself
of every option.

12:05.351 --> 12:08.217
You're risking her life
on a wild goose chase.

12:10.089 --> 12:12.221
You underestimate her.

12:12.257 --> 12:14.291
I think she's going
to surprise us all.

12:14.327 --> 12:18.062
And yes, I do want the people
I work for to notice.

12:18.098 --> 12:20.163
They think Reverie 1.0
is a toy.

12:20.199 --> 12:25.134
And I want them to see
that 2.0 is a tool.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.437
To enter another person's mind?

12:27.473 --> 12:29.172
To talk to them
in their dreams?

12:29.208 --> 12:32.176
What Mara is doing
is a revolution.

12:32.212 --> 12:34.478
The treatment for PTSD alone
could be transformational.

12:34.514 --> 12:37.246
Not to mention training,
strategic planning...

12:37.282 --> 12:39.752
Intelligence gathering.

12:42.354 --> 12:43.419
Of course.

12:43.455 --> 12:44.988
At the end of the day,

12:45.024 --> 12:46.757
Mara knew
what she was getting into.

12:46.793 --> 12:48.392
Maybe if you were as concerned
about the people

12:48.428 --> 12:50.094
we're trying to protect
as you are about her...

12:50.130 --> 12:51.762
Don't try to guilt me

12:51.798 --> 12:55.499
when you know good and well...

12:55.535 --> 12:57.304
Yes?

12:59.405 --> 13:02.105
And you're certain?

13:02.141 --> 13:04.374
Thanks.

13:04.410 --> 13:06.042
What's the matter?

13:06.078 --> 13:08.077
LAPD says
the real Denise Lang

13:08.113 --> 13:09.513
just identified herself
to the authorities.

13:09.549 --> 13:11.347
She's been out
on medical leave for a month.

13:11.383 --> 13:14.317
- But the badge.
- Someone forged it.

13:14.353 --> 13:16.018
Borrowed her identity.

13:16.054 --> 13:19.355
So if this other woman
is Denise Lang,

13:19.391 --> 13:21.225
who is Mara with?

13:31.203 --> 13:33.269
<i>If we use
the surveillance video</i>

13:33.305 --> 13:34.805
<i>as a blueprint for Denise,</i>

13:34.841 --> 13:36.539
<i>it'll be like
a replay of her memory.</i>

13:36.575 --> 13:38.207
<i>And creating this memory</i>

13:38.243 --> 13:40.377
<i>will get her to remember
Silas' face?</i>

13:40.413 --> 13:42.446
<i>Maybe.</i>

13:48.054 --> 13:50.019
Silas!

13:50.055 --> 13:51.758
Come back.

13:56.558 --> 13:59.389
<i>The coma patient is named
Ashley Trent.</i>

13:59.425 --> 14:00.617
<i>She's 20 years old</i>

14:00.653 --> 14:02.524
<i>and was born in Santa Barbara.</i>

14:02.560 --> 14:04.427
Why wasn't this picked up
earlier?

14:04.463 --> 14:05.995
Well, Denise Lang's
work status

14:06.031 --> 14:07.831
was never updated
by the security company.

14:07.867 --> 14:09.999
We were working fast
and missed it.

14:10.035 --> 14:12.000
Ashley Trent used
Denise's identity

14:12.036 --> 14:13.602
to get into to the
building to make sure

14:13.638 --> 14:15.572
Silas got through security
with the bomb.

14:15.608 --> 14:17.207
Well, didn't anyone notice
that Ashley

14:17.243 --> 14:19.008
you know,
wasn't the real Denise?

14:19.044 --> 14:22.010
The security company works
dozens of buildings.

14:22.046 --> 14:24.013
The guards cycle through them
all the time.

14:24.049 --> 14:27.449
Nobody knew Denise
at Mercodyne.

14:27.485 --> 14:29.552
It's not her.

14:29.588 --> 14:32.255
Callously taking scores
of innocent lives.

14:32.291 --> 14:36.024
That just doesn't feel like
the person that I met.

14:36.060 --> 14:38.093
Whatever her name is,

14:38.129 --> 14:40.029
she's not killing people.

14:40.065 --> 14:42.899
I don't understand. Why are
we still talking about this?

14:42.935 --> 14:44.167
We did what you asked.
Aren't we done?

14:44.203 --> 14:46.068
We don't have Silas.

14:46.104 --> 14:49.172
And there are still more bombs
out there that will go off.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.573
But we do have a connection
with someone that may be

14:51.609 --> 14:54.210
able to give us information.

14:54.246 --> 14:56.111
So, no.

14:56.147 --> 15:00.015
To be frank, that sounds like
your problem, not ours.

15:00.051 --> 15:01.954
I'll be in my office.

15:08.294 --> 15:10.159
I could go back in.

15:10.195 --> 15:12.629
- Talk to her.
- You sure you want to do that?

15:12.665 --> 15:15.999
Like she said, we still
don't know where the bombs are.

15:16.035 --> 15:17.634
Maybe I can find out.

15:17.670 --> 15:19.936
Look, the doctors say
she's right on the edge.

15:19.972 --> 15:21.604
You don't want to be in there
when she crashes.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.039
I'll be okay.

15:24.075 --> 15:26.576
But I need more information
about Ashley.

15:26.612 --> 15:30.013
We can get you that.
What do you need to know?

15:30.049 --> 15:32.151
Who she really is.

15:33.551 --> 15:35.050
Alexis.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.122
Alexis.

15:40.158 --> 15:42.491
What?

15:42.527 --> 15:43.960
Anything you want
to say to me?

15:43.996 --> 15:45.561
No, other than I feel like

15:45.597 --> 15:47.697
I'm on the outs
in my own company.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.631
She's ordering us around.

15:49.667 --> 15:54.069
You gave her the source code
and you didn't even tell me.

15:54.105 --> 15:57.039
- How could you do that?
- It was part of the deal.

15:57.075 --> 15:59.274
You never want to know the
details so I took care of it.

15:59.310 --> 16:02.278
Well, I don't want it
that way anymore.

16:02.314 --> 16:03.980
It's my company.

16:04.016 --> 16:06.515
I want to know the truth
about what's going on.

16:06.551 --> 16:09.555
You want it to be
your company, then act like it.

16:13.691 --> 16:15.692
I rewrote 300 lines
of source code

16:15.728 --> 16:17.260
in 20 minutes this morning.

16:17.296 --> 16:18.995
It's my company.

16:19.031 --> 16:20.996
- There's more to it than that.
- Really?

16:21.032 --> 16:22.597
I don't think Steve Jobs
ran Apple

16:22.633 --> 16:25.702
based on his people skills
and mature personality.

16:25.738 --> 16:29.371
- It was his vision.
- You need more than vision.

16:29.407 --> 16:31.307
You need to look up
and see people.

16:31.343 --> 16:32.976
The people affected
by your product,

16:33.012 --> 16:35.281
the people that make it.
You need...

16:39.584 --> 16:41.186
We're going for a ride.

16:44.390 --> 16:45.558
Where?

16:47.593 --> 16:50.025
Thanks for taking the time
to speak with me, Mrs. Trent.

16:50.061 --> 16:51.361
I know that this is

16:51.397 --> 16:53.196
an incredibly difficult day
for you.

16:53.232 --> 16:54.997
No, I'm flattered
by the attention.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.298
You're the belle of the ball
when you give birth

16:56.334 --> 16:58.034
to a suspected terrorist.

16:58.070 --> 17:01.207
They'd like to talk to me
about Ashley next.

17:02.207 --> 17:04.705
I want to help her, but I
need to know more about her.

17:04.742 --> 17:07.376
What's she like?

17:07.412 --> 17:09.712
The Ashley I knew was...

17:09.748 --> 17:12.682
Wasn't always so angry.

17:12.718 --> 17:14.782
Ideological.

17:14.819 --> 17:18.221
My Ashley was...

17:18.257 --> 17:21.324
spirited, clever,

17:21.359 --> 17:24.093
and funny.

17:24.128 --> 17:27.363
Then her father decided
to swindle the life savings

17:27.398 --> 17:29.398
of a lot of people.

17:29.434 --> 17:33.135
A lot of people, so,

17:33.171 --> 17:37.106
he'll be in prison
for the rest of his life.

17:37.142 --> 17:39.408
How did she respond to that?

17:39.444 --> 17:42.211
I did my best to
keep her out of it.

17:42.247 --> 17:44.247
I said as little as I could.

17:44.283 --> 17:46.182
She was 13.

17:46.218 --> 17:48.384
But... she knew.

17:48.420 --> 17:50.619
Yeah, I mean, kids...

17:50.655 --> 17:54.323
they know way more than
we give them credit for.

17:54.359 --> 17:57.093
I tried to delay
the inevitable.

17:57.129 --> 18:01.364
Spare her the scar,
but then the civil suits began.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.266
And they took everything
away from us.

18:03.302 --> 18:06.301
Every single thing.

18:06.337 --> 18:07.670
Well, that must have
been devastating

18:07.706 --> 18:09.672
for the both of you.

18:09.708 --> 18:13.241
They were especially cruel
to Ashley.

18:13.277 --> 18:15.344
Vicious at her school.

18:15.380 --> 18:18.381
So that's when she began
running away.

18:18.417 --> 18:21.783
So eventually I sent her
to a wilderness camp,

18:21.819 --> 18:27.222
where you learn to conquer
your anger, but, um...

18:27.258 --> 18:29.295
she didn't.

18:30.728 --> 18:33.429
Mrs. Trent.

18:33.465 --> 18:36.269
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

18:37.702 --> 18:39.102
It's been over a year.

18:42.708 --> 18:44.709
My poor baby.

18:56.455 --> 18:57.854
According to Dylan,

18:57.890 --> 18:59.489
Edith Leonard is one
of the few people

18:59.525 --> 19:01.523
Ashley communicated with.

19:01.559 --> 19:03.495
I thought we'd talk to her.

19:05.229 --> 19:07.762
You can.
I'll stay out here.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.464
Wh... Hey!

19:09.500 --> 19:10.900
You're on this thing
too much.

19:10.936 --> 19:13.836
- I was working.
- You were hiding.

19:13.872 --> 19:15.304
That's why I brought
you out here.

19:15.340 --> 19:16.905
So you can interact
with real humans

19:16.941 --> 19:18.441
in the real world.

19:18.477 --> 19:20.510
- This is pointless.
- You want the truth?

19:20.546 --> 19:22.177
Here's some.

19:22.213 --> 19:24.212
We took money from Shaw
and the D.O.D.

19:24.248 --> 19:26.848
- We both agreed to do that.
- Because we needed it.

19:26.884 --> 19:28.518
- Yeah.
- To add extra developers.

19:28.554 --> 19:30.318
To push forward
on the rollout...

19:30.354 --> 19:32.320
And to move into
that fancy building.

19:32.356 --> 19:34.190
And to step up development
of 2.0.

19:34.226 --> 19:35.423
That's right.

19:35.459 --> 19:37.326
Well that money
came with strings.

19:37.362 --> 19:40.163
We both knew it.
Now we're dealing with it.

19:40.199 --> 19:42.898
You want to be protected?
Want me to keep lying to you?

19:42.934 --> 19:44.866
Stay here and play
with your phone.

19:44.902 --> 19:46.935
You want to take
some responsibility?

19:46.971 --> 19:49.374
Get out of the damn car.

20:05.324 --> 20:07.923
- May I help you?
- Hello, I'm Charles Ventana.

20:07.959 --> 20:09.558
This is Alexis Barrett.

20:09.594 --> 20:11.794
We were hoping to speak
with Edith Leonard?

20:11.830 --> 20:13.362
- Are you cops?
- Oh, no.

20:13.398 --> 20:15.498
We want to speak with her
about a friend of hers.

20:15.534 --> 20:17.599
Ashley Trent.
It's an emergency.

20:17.635 --> 20:19.367
Well, she's napping
right now,

20:19.403 --> 20:22.404
but if you want to hang
here I can go get her.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.873
Sure. Thanks.

20:23.909 --> 20:26.442
Ah, I didn't catch your name?

20:26.478 --> 20:27.943
Margaret.

20:27.979 --> 20:29.614
Thank you, Margaret.

20:33.951 --> 20:36.251
Why does your face
look like that?

20:36.287 --> 20:38.453
I don't think her name
was Margaret.

20:38.489 --> 20:40.256
Why not?

20:40.292 --> 20:42.525
She thought about it
before saying it.

20:45.296 --> 20:46.832
Hello?

20:48.267 --> 20:50.398
Margaret?

20:50.434 --> 20:52.103
Charlie.

20:55.973 --> 20:57.539
Look.

21:01.446 --> 21:03.311
Edith!

21:03.347 --> 21:04.981
- We just want to talk.
- No.

21:05.017 --> 21:06.949
Edith.

21:09.287 --> 21:10.885
- Whoa.
- Stay away from me.

21:12.524 --> 21:14.923
Just lower the gun.

21:14.959 --> 21:16.525
Do you think I'm stupid?

21:16.561 --> 21:18.661
Your friend Ashley is dying.

21:18.697 --> 21:20.596
I don't believe you.

21:20.632 --> 21:23.365
Because Ashley's already dead.
Silas told me.

21:23.401 --> 21:25.433
She sacrificed herself,
and she took all those

21:25.469 --> 21:27.269
obedient sheep with her.

21:27.305 --> 21:29.571
- Innocent people, Edith.
- There's no such thing.

21:29.607 --> 21:32.308
And their deaths pale
in comparison

21:32.344 --> 21:35.344
to the people who die every day
due to military indifference.

21:35.380 --> 21:39.648
The rain of fire begins today.
It's gonna burn you out.

21:39.684 --> 21:42.518
No!

21:48.481 --> 21:49.525
They're combing the house
right now.

21:49.561 --> 21:51.951
Obviously the timeline
has tightened.

21:51.987 --> 21:52.987
Mara.

21:53.023 --> 21:53.930
I know this is tough

21:53.966 --> 21:55.104
considering what just happened.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.745
- But we have to keep working.
- I know.

21:57.781 --> 21:59.050
How much time
do you think we have?

21:59.086 --> 22:01.182
Based on what Edith said?
Hours.

22:01.218 --> 22:03.132
We need to you to go back
in right now.

22:03.168 --> 22:04.600
I know. I'm ready.

22:04.636 --> 22:06.438
Actually, I have a plan.

22:13.710 --> 22:15.277
You know, I... I'd, um,

22:15.313 --> 22:17.312
I'd keep conversation
to a minimum.

22:17.348 --> 22:19.717
We were flying blind
on her voice.

22:21.718 --> 22:24.219
Be safe. Good luck.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.190
Thanks.

22:32.796 --> 22:35.266
<i>Apertus.</i>

23:09.867 --> 23:11.603
Edie?

23:13.438 --> 23:15.239
Edie, is that you?

23:18.976 --> 23:20.342
It is you.

23:20.378 --> 23:22.347
Oh, my God.

23:23.348 --> 23:24.813
Wha...

23:24.849 --> 23:27.848
Wha... what are you doing here?

23:27.884 --> 23:30.751
What's wrong?

23:30.787 --> 23:32.621
Nothing feels right.

23:32.657 --> 23:34.855
Everything is just wrong.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.425
I can't open any doors.
My phone doesn't work.

23:37.461 --> 23:39.728
All these people
are, like, weird.

23:39.764 --> 23:41.762
They don't know anything.

23:41.798 --> 23:44.869
- I'm totally tripping right now.
- Okay, chill.

23:46.403 --> 23:48.636
There's something
I need to you look at.

23:48.672 --> 23:50.275
- What?
- Please.

23:54.711 --> 23:56.310
What?

23:56.346 --> 23:58.579
Open it and tell me
what you see.

24:19.469 --> 24:21.670
Well, what do you see?

24:21.706 --> 24:22.873
A closet.

24:24.574 --> 24:26.444
It can't be.

24:27.945 --> 24:31.846
This is wrong.
This is... all wrong.

24:31.882 --> 24:34.615
- We're being punished.
- What?

24:34.651 --> 24:37.652
We shouldn't be doing this,
Edie, any of this.

24:37.688 --> 24:39.488
Silas was wrong.

24:39.524 --> 24:40.822
We can stop it
from happening.

24:40.858 --> 24:42.490
There's still time.

24:42.526 --> 24:44.825
- We can go to the police.
- I don't feel good.

24:44.861 --> 24:46.560
We can tell them
where the bombs are.

24:46.596 --> 24:48.864
We can save lives.
We can do that, Ashley.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.565
I know you want to.

24:50.601 --> 24:52.704
Ashley, what's wrong?

24:55.640 --> 24:57.542
Ashley.

25:01.845 --> 25:03.577
That was close.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.350
- What's happening?
- Ashley's lung collapsed.

25:08.386 --> 25:10.318
The doctors are trying
to stabilize her now.

25:10.354 --> 25:13.654
- Her organs are failing and we...
- What did she say?

25:15.860 --> 25:17.592
- Nothing.
- What do you mean?

25:17.628 --> 25:18.927
She collapsed.

25:18.963 --> 25:20.729
But as soon as she's stable
I'll go back in...

25:20.765 --> 25:22.596
No, there's no time.

25:22.632 --> 25:24.833
One of my teams received
a tip about a location.

25:24.869 --> 25:27.736
I was hoping
she could confirm it.

25:39.751 --> 25:42.851
I don't think Ashley wanted
to go along with any of this.

25:42.887 --> 25:44.486
What do you mean?

25:44.522 --> 25:45.653
Well, just before
she collapsed,

25:45.689 --> 25:47.489
she said that Silas was wrong.

25:47.525 --> 25:51.425
Uh, she felt agitated,
felt like she was going crazy.

25:51.461 --> 25:53.527
That could be
for any number of reasons.

25:53.563 --> 25:55.796
But then
she showed me a door.

25:55.832 --> 25:59.433
I opened it, and it was filled
with a forest.

25:59.469 --> 26:00.768
Like a doorway?

26:00.804 --> 26:03.441
There was a cabin
right in the middle.

26:05.774 --> 26:06.874
Spontaneous portal generation

26:06.910 --> 26:10.479
in a traumatized brain?
This is fascinating.

26:10.515 --> 26:12.514
English please.

26:12.550 --> 26:16.918
Her brain is building
an alternate Reverie space

26:16.954 --> 26:20.521
- on its own.
- But how is that possible?

26:20.557 --> 26:22.524
She doesn't even know
she's in a Reverie.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.924
Well, you said
she was agitated.

26:23.960 --> 26:27.696
Maybe her brain isn't accepting
the Reverie we built.

26:27.732 --> 26:29.431
So it's building its own.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.833
- Like a refuge.
- Maybe.

26:31.869 --> 26:34.803
Look, the BCI reacts in
response to powerful stimuli.

26:34.839 --> 26:37.838
If her brain is building
this forest and cabin,

26:37.874 --> 26:39.877
it must have great significance
for her.

26:41.711 --> 26:44.613
You're gonna go back in,
aren't you?

26:44.649 --> 26:46.014
I have to.

26:46.050 --> 26:49.955
Mara, she almost died
the last time.

26:51.589 --> 26:54.525
You don't want to be
in there when that happens.

26:55.993 --> 26:58.530
It's a risk I have to take.

27:08.605 --> 27:11.539
They took her
off the ventilator.

27:11.575 --> 27:13.879
The doctors say
it won't be long now.

27:19.784 --> 27:21.917
Mrs. Trent, I'd love to ask
you one more question

27:21.953 --> 27:24.489
about Ashley, if I may.

27:26.023 --> 27:28.789
Did she spend much time

27:28.825 --> 27:31.759
at a log cabin in the woods?

27:31.795 --> 27:35.529
We had a cabin in Beaverton.

27:35.565 --> 27:38.467
Spent every summer there
when she was little.

27:38.503 --> 27:40.969
How did you know
about our cabin?

27:41.005 --> 27:45.075
Well, uh, it's... it's kind
of hard to explain.

27:47.078 --> 27:49.710
We built it together
as a family.

27:49.746 --> 27:52.012
Ashley was so proud.

27:52.048 --> 27:54.615
Every night we would
roast marshmallows,

27:54.651 --> 27:55.917
and then I would
read to her

27:55.953 --> 27:58.623
from "Alice in Wonderland"
before bed.

28:04.027 --> 28:06.698
Apparently she still read it.

28:07.797 --> 28:09.764
It was in her personal effects

28:09.800 --> 28:12.838
when the police found it
at her friend's house.

28:14.804 --> 28:17.074
She memorized the whole book.

28:19.744 --> 28:23.678
All that time I thought
I was protecting her, I...

28:23.714 --> 28:25.617
I was protecting myself.

28:27.584 --> 28:29.584
Exploiting her really.

28:29.620 --> 28:32.053
So I could pretend
none of it happened, you know.

28:34.158 --> 28:36.794
No wonder Ashley was so mad.

28:38.696 --> 28:40.966
Everyone exploited her.

28:42.699 --> 28:44.835
No one was giving her
what she needed.

28:46.771 --> 28:48.106
The truth.

28:50.041 --> 28:52.711
<i>Apertus.</i>

29:28.778 --> 29:30.714
Ashley?

29:43.026 --> 29:44.159
Hello, Monica.

29:44.195 --> 29:46.661
- The tip was a hoax.
- <i>What?</i>

29:46.697 --> 29:48.095
Silas put us
on a wild goose chase.

29:48.131 --> 29:49.931
We got nothing.
Where's Mara?

29:49.967 --> 29:51.865
I don't know. I'm looking
for her myself.

29:51.901 --> 29:54.639
Well, find her or we're gonna
have a lot more people dead.

30:15.443 --> 30:17.375
You're one of them.

30:17.411 --> 30:19.878
From out there.

30:19.914 --> 30:22.248
Are more of you starting
to come in here?

30:22.284 --> 30:24.150
No.

30:24.186 --> 30:26.152
No, Ashley, it's just me.

30:26.188 --> 30:28.887
How do you know my name?

30:28.923 --> 30:32.124
Did you come to get me?
Are you even real?

30:32.160 --> 30:34.125
- Okay, listen. Listen to me.
- Oh, God.

30:34.161 --> 30:36.394
- You're okay.
- No, I'm not.

30:36.430 --> 30:40.199
- I'm not okay.
- You're right.

30:40.235 --> 30:42.867
You're not.
I'm sorry.

30:42.903 --> 30:44.302
I don't understand
what's happening.

30:44.338 --> 30:46.105
I... I'm losing my mind.

30:46.141 --> 30:48.406
I don't know
what's real anymore.

30:48.442 --> 30:50.142
And why would you?

30:50.178 --> 30:51.443
People have done nothing
but mess with you.

30:51.479 --> 30:53.412
Your parents.

30:53.448 --> 30:55.950
Silas. Even me.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.250
Who are you?

30:59.286 --> 31:00.922
Um...

31:02.757 --> 31:05.891
My name is Mara Kint.

31:05.927 --> 31:07.960
And...

31:07.996 --> 31:10.332
I'm here to tell you the truth.

31:13.367 --> 31:17.036
You've been put into something
called Reverie.

31:17.072 --> 31:19.305
It's a computer program
that interacts with your brain

31:19.341 --> 31:23.142
to create
a virtual environment.

31:23.178 --> 31:24.714
Like this one.

31:26.381 --> 31:28.383
None of this is real?

31:30.317 --> 31:32.384
It's all in my head?
Even you?

31:32.420 --> 31:35.421
Well, um, I'm real
in the outside world,

31:35.457 --> 31:39.959
but in here... no.

31:39.995 --> 31:43.362
Everything here is created.

31:43.398 --> 31:45.231
This is all fantasy.

31:45.267 --> 31:48.500
Even when I pretended to be
your friend in the lobby.

31:48.536 --> 31:52.171
That wa... wasn't Edith,
that was you?

31:52.207 --> 31:54.472
Yes.

31:54.508 --> 31:56.541
And I shouldn't have done that.

31:56.577 --> 31:58.978
I took on her form to get
something from you

31:59.014 --> 32:01.247
and that wasn't fair.

32:01.283 --> 32:04.048
I'm very sorry.

32:04.084 --> 32:06.018
And I created this?

32:06.054 --> 32:09.154
Uh, well,

32:09.190 --> 32:11.123
no.

32:11.159 --> 32:16.394
My company did
because you're in a coma.

32:16.430 --> 32:19.334
We put you in this place
because we need your help.

32:23.004 --> 32:24.540
Am I dying?

32:32.279 --> 32:33.449
Yeah.

32:35.283 --> 32:37.148
Yeah.

32:37.184 --> 32:39.020
I can feel it.

32:41.555 --> 32:44.522
The bomb went off, didn't it?

32:44.558 --> 32:46.161
Yes.

32:48.563 --> 32:50.498
Were a lot of people hurt?

32:52.200 --> 32:53.568
Yes.

32:56.270 --> 33:00.471
Silas said no people.

33:00.507 --> 33:04.175
We were just going to get
attention for what's going on.

33:04.211 --> 33:06.347
He promised me.

33:07.649 --> 33:11.320
Oh, Ashley, I'm sure he
promised you a lot of things.

33:12.519 --> 33:16.154
He said he loved me.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.423
He said we were family.

33:18.459 --> 33:21.527
He said what he needed to say
to get you to believe in him.

33:21.563 --> 33:23.429
Ashley, he knew
about the problems

33:23.465 --> 33:26.298
between your mom and dad,
how all you wanted was family.

33:26.334 --> 33:29.268
He preyed on your need
for connection

33:29.304 --> 33:31.140
when you were
the most vulnerable.

33:32.673 --> 33:36.311
I felt alone until Silas.

33:37.612 --> 33:42.381
I was going the wrong way,
and he... he helped me.

33:42.417 --> 33:44.383
He said I mattered.

33:44.419 --> 33:48.623
I finally felt like I was
a part of something.

33:49.490 --> 33:51.227
The truth.

33:53.228 --> 33:56.194
But I'm... I'm just a monster.

33:56.230 --> 33:58.263
No, you're not.

33:58.299 --> 34:00.398
You've just been lost.

34:00.434 --> 34:03.502
And, honey, your mom
doesn't blame you.

34:03.538 --> 34:06.138
She told me.

34:06.174 --> 34:08.110
You know my mother?

34:10.210 --> 34:12.578
And out in the real world,

34:12.614 --> 34:16.114
she's by your bedside,

34:16.150 --> 34:18.152
holding your hand.

34:21.656 --> 34:26.623
I... I never wanted
any of this to happen.

34:26.659 --> 34:30.194
I thought all we were going
to do was send a message.

34:30.230 --> 34:32.630
<i>That day I had to let Silas
in through a side door</i>

34:32.667 --> 34:34.565
<i>so the bag
wouldn't be scanned.</i>

34:34.601 --> 34:36.502
<i>I used the guard's key
to open the closet</i>

34:36.538 --> 34:38.402
<i>and hide the bomb.</i>

34:38.438 --> 34:41.639
<i>It was supposed to be set
for nine hours later.</i>

34:41.676 --> 34:44.375
<i>But when I saw it
was set for 45 seconds,</i>

34:44.411 --> 34:47.478
I didn't know what to do.

34:47.514 --> 34:49.647
I froze.

34:49.683 --> 34:52.516
But you didn't run.

34:52.553 --> 34:55.286
You could have left.
You could have saved yourself...

34:55.322 --> 34:56.420
I guess
it doesn't matter now.

34:56.456 --> 34:57.723
Oh, yes, it does.

34:57.759 --> 35:00.930
You can stop it
from happening again.

35:08.203 --> 35:10.435
Ashley. Do you know
where the other bombs are?

35:10.471 --> 35:13.372
If you tell me,
nobody else gets hurt.

35:22.584 --> 35:24.682
There's one set to go off

35:24.718 --> 35:26.718
at the
Sepulveda Federal Building

35:26.754 --> 35:28.553
near the loading docks.

35:28.589 --> 35:30.555
Thank you.

35:34.696 --> 35:37.528
It's happening.

35:37.564 --> 35:39.263
I think you should go.

35:39.299 --> 35:41.633
Mara.

35:41.669 --> 35:43.602
One... one more thing.

35:43.638 --> 35:45.406
One more thing.

35:58.054 --> 35:59.923
<i>Exitus.</i>

36:47.103 --> 36:48.938
She's gone.

36:53.675 --> 36:55.846
I'm so sorry.

37:04.219 --> 37:08.924
Remember how I asked you
about your family's log cabin?

37:14.230 --> 37:17.067
I knew about it
because Ashley showed it to me.

37:18.199 --> 37:19.965
How?

37:20.001 --> 37:22.469
She built it.

37:22.505 --> 37:25.404
In the Reverie.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.541
<i>And she stopped another
tragedy from happening.</i>

37:32.715 --> 37:34.380
<i>All clear.</i>

37:34.416 --> 37:38.951
She used her last moments
on this earth

37:38.987 --> 37:40.152
to save lives.

37:41.690 --> 37:44.924
And she wanted me
to tell you...

37:44.960 --> 37:46.996
Ladybug loved you.

37:50.032 --> 37:52.035
So very much.

37:57.539 --> 38:00.643
I haven't called her that
since she was a little girl.

38:02.610 --> 38:05.011
We couldn't read
"Alice in Wonderland"

38:05.047 --> 38:10.116
until Miss Ladybug was snug
in her bed.

38:10.152 --> 38:13.420
And she wanted me
to do one last thing for you.

38:23.565 --> 38:25.031
"'Would you tell me please

38:25.067 --> 38:27.469
"which way I ought to go
from here?'

38:29.271 --> 38:31.438
"'That depends a good deal
on where you want to go, '

38:31.474 --> 38:34.574
"said the cat.

38:34.610 --> 38:38.277
"'I don't much care where, '
said Alice.

38:38.313 --> 38:42.114
"'Then it doesn't matter which
way you go, ' said the cat.

38:42.150 --> 38:44.620
'So long as I get somewhere.'"

38:54.096 --> 38:56.228
Hey.

38:56.264 --> 38:59.032
I wanted to check on you.

38:59.068 --> 39:03.036
What you did with the program
saved a lot of lives today.

39:03.072 --> 39:05.307
Don't let anything else that
happened make you forget that.

39:10.646 --> 39:12.244
But what I really came here
to tell you about

39:12.280 --> 39:14.116
was Sidney Wilks.

39:15.650 --> 39:18.150
He was a friend of mine.

39:18.186 --> 39:21.657
One day, we were 15
at the time...

39:24.126 --> 39:26.759
He just kept saying how
he was going to fly away.

39:26.795 --> 39:29.531
Just fly away.

39:31.099 --> 39:34.567
He leapt back, I reached out.

39:34.603 --> 39:36.639
He fell 12 stories.

39:38.306 --> 39:40.342
He was high.

39:42.110 --> 39:44.547
Why are you telling me this?

39:46.548 --> 39:50.116
He's the first person
I saw die.

39:50.152 --> 39:53.520
I've talked about Sidney
for a long time

39:53.556 --> 39:55.125
because it helps.

39:57.659 --> 40:00.659
I'm sorry about
what you saw today.

40:00.695 --> 40:03.766
And I'm ready to listen anytime
you want to talk about Edith.

40:07.869 --> 40:11.306
Edith wasn't the first person
I've seen die.

40:13.275 --> 40:15.077
I know.

40:20.882 --> 40:22.585
Charlie.

40:27.822 --> 40:30.192
Thanks.

40:54.282 --> 40:57.717
Okay. Well, this day's done.

40:57.753 --> 41:01.320
- Yes, it is.
- Anyone for a drink?

41:01.356 --> 41:03.822
- Oh, yeah.
- You've earned it.

41:03.858 --> 41:06.425
I'll leave it if you'd rather

41:06.461 --> 41:08.128
- be alone.
- Don't be silly.

41:08.164 --> 41:10.733
I'll rustle up some glasses.

41:14.903 --> 41:17.636
Thank you.

41:17.672 --> 41:20.773
For everything.

41:20.809 --> 41:22.644
You're welcome.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.880
Hey. Can I have some?

41:27.916 --> 41:30.750
Of course.
Come over here.

41:40.295 --> 41:41.628
Here you go.

41:41.664 --> 41:43.466
I'd like to propose a toast.

41:46.235 --> 41:48.268
Job well done.

41:48.304 --> 41:50.170
The program.

41:50.206 --> 41:52.906
To teamwork.

41:52.942 --> 41:55.144
Steve Jobs.

41:57.679 --> 41:59.414
To Ashley.

42:01.217 --> 42:03.916
Hear, hear.
