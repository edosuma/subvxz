WEBVTT

02:53.757 --> 02:56.844
Hello?

03:03.475 --> 03:05.227
Fuck is going on out here, man?

04:14.421 --> 04:15.506
Yes!

04:25.182 --> 04:29.478
This is SOC Trevante Cole, Task Unit…

04:31.104 --> 04:32.648
Saxo.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.900
I'm located at FOB Clemons.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.109
Anyone out there?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.365
If anybody can hear me…

04:45.118 --> 04:49.373
If anyone is out there,
I am located at FOB Clemons.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.629
My eight-digit grid is…

04:56.463 --> 05:01.301
2-niner-three-five, break,

05:01.718 --> 05:04.388
8-8-0-5.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.687
SOC Trevante Cole, Task Force Saxo.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.940
I am the sole survivor
of Operation Vantage.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.026
Do any US or friendly forces read me?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.909
Three-five, break,

05:25.993 --> 05:29.162
8-8-0-5.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.125
And I need a helo extract ASAP.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.095
Fuck!

07:38.041 --> 07:39.877
At this rate, maybe a week.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.379
With rations,
we could stretch another week, maybe.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.423
And I gotta get the genny going again too.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.551
-Yeah.
-You gotta be careful. There's a curfew.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.928
There's a lot of whack jobs
acting like militia.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.013
Yeah.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.515
We want you to be safe
till you find somewhere.

07:53.599 --> 07:56.977
All I was saying is that one of us
needs to go to the store, that's all.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.854
You and I can go. Bring the gun.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.442
Okay. My kids though…

08:04.735 --> 08:07.905
I don't know about a gun.
And I just wanna be with them.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.157
And if we…

08:10.240 --> 08:12.367
We could try going to the Sanders' house.

08:12.451 --> 08:16.205
They may have extra food, batteries.
They spend the winters out here.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.207
They have kids of their own, honey.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.667
They're good people, but you know Bill.

08:21.543 --> 08:22.544
I'll go.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.463
Oh, no--

08:24.546 --> 08:25.714
Are you sure?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.090
I'll go to the store.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.178
We have money. You gave us shelter, food.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.889
Are you sure you don't want me to?

08:34.389 --> 08:35.390
I'll go.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.308
They'll be less afraid
if you're with them.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.022
And can you get us some gummies
if they have them?

08:42.105 --> 08:43.732
If they have them, yes.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.738
Hey, come here. Come here.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.201
Any requests?

08:55.244 --> 08:56.245
Run!

08:58.288 --> 08:59.331
Be safe.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.750
There's nothing to be worried about.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.295
Now your turn.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.967
You're the man of the house now.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.939
I'll get you.
I'll get you, Sarah. Come here.

09:30.904 --> 09:31.905
Hey.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.658
-What is that?
-Let's look ahead.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.160
-Let's hurry up.
-Hey, guys, look at the window.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.584
-Do you think someone's in there?
-I don't know.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.377
Yo!

09:46.170 --> 09:48.380
-Hello?
-Hello?

09:49.339 --> 09:50.966
Is there anyone in there?

09:54.428 --> 09:55.512
Guys, guys.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.181
Chocolate!

09:57.848 --> 09:59.600
-Oh, my God.
-Let's go!

10:01.185 --> 10:02.936
Oh, my God.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.444
So hungry.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.531
They got crisps too! Come on. Come on.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.452
This tastes better than sex.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.995
That's what your mum told me.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.706
-Let's go!
-Biggie!

10:22.789 --> 10:24.041
Yes, bro!

10:24.666 --> 10:26.084
Where's the driver?

10:26.710 --> 10:29.379
Maybe someone came along, scooped him up.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.924
He could be laid up in a hospital by now.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.967
I'm sure he's all right if he isn't here.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.060
Hey, Jamila! Chocolate!

11:15.926 --> 11:16.927
Alf.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.596
Alfie!

11:21.348 --> 11:22.349
-Yeah?
-Yo.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.352
Can you try and get a signal from this?
See if you can call in for help.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.436
Okay.

11:49.710 --> 11:53.672
-Oi! You're making it worse.
-Hold on. I could be getting a signal.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.048
What you are hearing

11:55.132 --> 11:56.967
-is an emergency broadcast.
-Or signals.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.846
Emergency broadcast. This is not a test.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.639
You're a genius, man.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.266
Emergency broadcast.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.726
This is not a test.

12:06.852 --> 12:10.355
Please remain indoors
and wait for further information.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.566
What you are hearing
is an emergency broadcast.

12:14.526 --> 12:18.447
Change the channel, okay?
Get another signal or something.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.744
-Shit.
-Hello?

12:24.995 --> 12:26.371
Can anyone hear?

12:26.455 --> 12:29.291
Is there anyone there?
We've been attacked.

12:50.604 --> 12:51.688
What's happening?

13:07.412 --> 13:10.082
JAPAN AEROSPACE
EXPLORATION AGENCY

13:23.470 --> 13:25.305
HINATA MURAI

13:26.306 --> 13:29.518
What's happening with this? Look again.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.895
Hashimoto-san.

13:35.399 --> 13:36.984
We need to talk.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.569
We have nothing to talk about.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.446
-I'm calling security.
-Listen to me.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.699
This isn't what I have to say,

13:43.782 --> 13:45.534
but somebody else.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.373
Please carry on. Excuse me for a moment.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.542
What is she doing?

13:56.295 --> 13:57.462
Do you see something?

13:59.089 --> 14:00.757
I can't see anything.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.635
-Wajo.
-Say something.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.470
Wajo.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.681
I fired you, didn't I?

14:08.557 --> 14:10.517
You broke in and made it this far.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.144
Surely you knew
the next step would be jail.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.520
Yes, that is right.

14:14.646 --> 14:15.856
Why?

14:16.481 --> 14:19.985
The sound: "Wajo." If that was audible,
that means the Hoshi didn't depressurize.

14:20.068 --> 14:23.363
In short, there's still air. Which means--

14:23.447 --> 14:25.532
Which means…

14:25.616 --> 14:27.784
they are all alive?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.455
Hashimoto-san,
how many years have you been married?

14:32.706 --> 14:34.541
I'm not sure how this is relevant.

14:36.293 --> 14:41.465
Twenty-seven years.

14:42.007 --> 14:46.220
Even if it was speculation, what if…

14:47.387 --> 14:50.182
you were able to save your wife?

14:50.766 --> 14:52.851
What would you do?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.360
You were having an affair.

15:02.861 --> 15:03.862
With who?

15:04.571 --> 15:05.572
Satoshi?

15:05.656 --> 15:06.865
Ryusei?

15:14.581 --> 15:18.001
But then that guy-- that man…

15:20.212 --> 15:21.255
The Emperor Hit Man was--

15:21.338 --> 15:23.674
An awful actor.

15:25.384 --> 15:26.677
Yeah.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.054
No disagreement with you there.

15:35.102 --> 15:40.524
You aren't the only one
that heard something in that transmission.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.695
That sound.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.408
Those people aren't JASA.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.076
They're linguists.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.914
What are you hiding?

17:35.138 --> 17:37.349
-Ma'am, what are you doing here?
-You shouldn't be out.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.935
Excuse me.
You are aware there's a curfew, right?

17:40.018 --> 17:41.979
-Are you here alone?
-Yes.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.273
-Are you hurt? Injured?
-No.

17:44.356 --> 17:47.150
-Are you sure? We can get you a doctor.
-Yeah, I'm fine.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.319
-Ma'am, listen--
-I'm a doctor. I'm fine.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.238
I'm just here getting food.

17:51.321 --> 17:54.533
You're a doctor? Ma'am,
we could definitely use another doctor.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.285
There's not much left here.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.245
-Nothing left?
-The looters have taken everything.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.038
Look, we're headed to the next town.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.082
There's a lot of provisions there
for people who help.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.166
We need volunteers.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.711
And we could definitely
use another doctor.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.967
All right,
so we're gonna leave your car here.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.220
We need to limit traffic to our vehicles
as much as we can.

18:15.721 --> 18:16.972
There'll be supplies there.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.600
One of ours heading this way
will bring you back.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.686
You can ride in the ambulance
with the other medical staff.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.104
All right, Doctor?

18:24.605 --> 18:25.647
Thank you.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.574
Not exactly the usual rounds.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.287
Thought I saw everything
I was gonna see in my residency.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.458
David Barton, orthopedics,
St. Mary's in Trenton.

18:44.958 --> 18:45.959
Anee--

18:47.920 --> 18:51.381
Angela. Angela Lockhart,
pediatrics, NYU Medical.

18:52.508 --> 18:54.384
Good to meet you, Dr. Lockhart.

18:54.468 --> 18:56.303
All right, let's move. Lock it up.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.819
Somebody kill that.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.034
Why'd you do that?

19:19.117 --> 19:21.286
-That was our only way to communicate--
-With who?

19:22.538 --> 19:24.540
Some Chinese halfway round the globe,
yeah?

19:24.623 --> 19:25.999
Now we don't know what's going on.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.377
Yes, we do. Okay?

19:28.460 --> 19:30.170
Some terrorist blew bombs somewhere.

19:30.254 --> 19:32.714
Or some Russian geezer
finally dropped a bomb on the Yanks.

19:32.798 --> 19:36.927
Or somebody shot up a church.
Or square. Maybe even our school.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.262
Okay? This is what they do.

19:39.555 --> 19:42.391
Grown-ups always fucking up the world.
Now they've done it again.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.978
Okay?
It's always the same old shit, isn't it?

19:47.271 --> 19:49.356
Guys, we need to get home.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.233
What, scared of some chocolate, yeah?

19:52.526 --> 19:55.821
You do wanna go home, don't you?

20:03.620 --> 20:04.913
What do you think it was?

20:06.957 --> 20:08.625
Yo, Casp. You all right?

20:11.670 --> 20:13.881
Yeah. I'm good.

20:46.622 --> 20:47.956
Man.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.168
Yeah, you'd think a brother would
get used to death the more he sees it.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.755
Fuck. Shit.

20:59.635 --> 21:01.220
I'm not good at this stuff, man.

21:07.768 --> 21:11.104
But dying's easy.
You know, you said that to me once, bro.

21:11.188 --> 21:13.232
Fuck. Fuck.

21:15.025 --> 21:18.987
You said a lot of stupid shit,
but, you know, I remember that one.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.032
I remembered it.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.995
And I remember the last thing
that you said to me.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.252
You said, "Go home."

21:41.301 --> 21:43.387
There's some very real shit going on here.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.100
And I know you saw it.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.353
And that's why you said,
"There's a fucking war coming."

21:54.356 --> 21:56.400
So I'm gonna listen to you this one time.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.945
And I promise you…

22:07.703 --> 22:08.745
I'm going home.

22:12.457 --> 22:13.584
I'm going home, okay?

22:30.934 --> 22:32.269
I'm not sure.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.070
What you want?

22:46.491 --> 22:47.784
You was telling the truth.

22:48.911 --> 22:50.078
About your dad.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.417
You don't wanna go home, do you?

23:01.381 --> 23:04.343
Look, you can tell me, okay?
You know my story.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.594
Well, you don't know mine.

23:11.350 --> 23:12.851
He didn't leave.

23:16.522 --> 23:17.898
My old man. I wish he did.

23:19.358 --> 23:20.817
Still shagging his secretary.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.445
Different ones, different years.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.241
Mum's still with us.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.244
She's up most nights…

23:32.871 --> 23:34.289
popping pills or whatever.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.044
I don't care.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.258
What, you sad about it?

23:48.303 --> 23:50.222
That's why you don't wanna go home.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.100
You two having a snog?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.228
You're scaring the others.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.396
They should be scared.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.982
All the more reason
they don't need you making it worse.

24:00.566 --> 24:02.442
Get on. Let's go.

24:07.698 --> 24:09.992
Yeah, grown-ups suck.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.120
And, yeah,
our parents are trying to off us.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.707
But we can't just sit here
and have a wank about it.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.585
So let's go home,

24:19.668 --> 24:20.961
nom some Quavers,

24:21.044 --> 24:23.338
and then we can swap
all the sob stories we want.

24:25.257 --> 24:26.383
Okay?

24:28.886 --> 24:29.887
All right.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.600
Grab whatever you can carry.
We're moving out.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.018
Jamila, go where?

24:38.187 --> 24:39.563
So, where you going?

24:40.981 --> 24:42.149
Well, come on.

24:42.232 --> 24:43.317
They said stay indoors.

24:43.901 --> 24:46.236
Someone's going to come. They have to.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.865
-And, Casp, man. Yo, there's chocolate.
-What?

24:50.699 --> 24:52.159
This isn't indoors.

24:53.243 --> 24:54.411
Home is that way.

24:54.912 --> 24:56.038
He's right.

24:56.705 --> 24:57.831
There's chocolate.

24:58.457 --> 24:59.583
And water.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.210
I don't wanna go. We've got a roof.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.086
Yeah, I'm staying too.

25:03.587 --> 25:04.588
Sames.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.298
Night's coming, innit?

25:07.591 --> 25:08.592
What about you?

25:09.635 --> 25:12.804
Casp, forget it, man.
This guy's all spit and no game.

25:12.888 --> 25:14.306
This guy's scared of the dark.

25:14.389 --> 25:16.600
-What you say, knobless?
-I said, "Prove it."

25:16.683 --> 25:17.809
Prove you're not scared.

25:17.893 --> 25:19.895
Prove you're not pissing your pants
right now, knobless.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.731
Alfie, listen, we've all the right
to be pissing our pants right now.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.399
He's the one pissing his pants.

25:24.483 --> 25:26.401
How am I supposed to piss my pants
if I ain't got a knob?

25:26.485 --> 25:27.778
-You squat.
-You squat!

25:27.861 --> 25:30.405
Leave him, okay? Let him stay if he wants.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.412
I'm not staying.

25:37.496 --> 25:40.499
The last thing I need is to sit around
and waste another minute with you lot.

25:44.044 --> 25:45.045
Let's go.

25:46.755 --> 25:47.756
J.

25:48.966 --> 25:50.050
Yo, bruv.

25:50.133 --> 25:53.136
To be real, I'm not scared of shit,
but my leg's fucked.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.013
Catch a cabbie or something.

25:55.097 --> 25:56.974
I can meet you halfway.
We can ditch these lot.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.478
Cool. Yeah, see you in a minute.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.355
See you in a minute.

26:06.024 --> 26:07.442
You gonna be okay?

26:07.526 --> 26:10.904
Come on, bro. Run to her.
I see youse talking.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.328
There's only five of us.

26:18.829 --> 26:20.414
At least we brought the worst one.

26:21.832 --> 26:24.459
Well, we don't have TV, so entertainment.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.587
You're entertaining enough.

26:51.987 --> 26:55.324
-What do they need us to do?
-What procedures?

26:56.074 --> 26:58.535
Beats me. Whatever they give us, I guess.

27:01.330 --> 27:02.956
Hey, Nurse. What have we got here?

27:03.040 --> 27:05.167
You can scrub, and they'll take you in.

27:05.709 --> 27:06.919
Doctor?

27:08.295 --> 27:09.546
We got a bleeder.

27:14.176 --> 27:15.594
Pass the defibrillator.

27:26.605 --> 27:28.190
Can someone get me the towels?

29:29.019 --> 29:31.104
Angela, you wanna help me over here?

29:32.940 --> 29:37.069
I got a laceration that needs closing.
I could use your help here.

29:39.154 --> 29:40.531
Don't know what caused it.

29:40.614 --> 29:43.367
Nurse said he had
some kind of collision, something.

29:43.450 --> 29:44.618
I don't know.

29:45.911 --> 29:47.162
Looks clean though.

29:54.586 --> 29:56.505
Angela.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.340
Angela, we need to close him up.

30:06.598 --> 30:07.599
What?

30:08.642 --> 30:09.685
What do you see?

30:17.025 --> 30:18.861
Whoa, whoa. Easy. Easy.

30:20.487 --> 30:22.656
Give me a hundred mics of fentanyl now.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.491
-Now!
-Got it.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.535
Suction.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.513
Heart rate climbing, 110.

30:50.601 --> 30:51.643
118.

30:52.436 --> 30:53.478
Angela?

30:54.438 --> 30:55.856
-132.
-Angela.

31:01.904 --> 31:03.488
Is that some kind of foreign body?

31:04.323 --> 31:05.616
Patient stabilizing.

31:07.492 --> 31:10.245
If I had closed him up with that in there,
he would have died.

31:13.749 --> 31:14.833
You saved him.

31:27.888 --> 31:31.308
This was sent from Kibo
about six hours ago.

31:31.391 --> 31:34.228
At first, we thought it was a malfunction.

31:34.686 --> 31:38.273
When we looked into it, we realized
that it wasn't coming from inside Kibo.

31:38.357 --> 31:39.733
That means…

31:41.068 --> 31:43.987
Sound cannot travel through space.

31:45.948 --> 31:48.408
We didn't know how to interpret it.

31:48.492 --> 31:50.369
But listen.

31:54.122 --> 31:55.165
It repeats.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.293
Perfectly.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.004
Then here…

32:07.845 --> 32:09.972
That's why you called linguists in.

32:14.101 --> 32:15.477
A language without sound.

32:17.688 --> 32:19.231
What in the world…

32:29.867 --> 32:31.702
What is it?

32:40.502 --> 32:42.171
Alien?

32:49.469 --> 32:52.264
Both its source and form
are extraterrestrial in nature.

32:52.931 --> 32:55.893
There is also interferometry data
getting collected

32:55.976 --> 32:57.978
by at least six event horizon telescopes.

33:01.106 --> 33:02.274
Wajo.

33:06.904 --> 33:08.071
Yes?

33:10.616 --> 33:12.409
Yes, I see.

33:26.715 --> 33:29.343
The Americans are on their way.

33:30.636 --> 33:36.892
All allied space programs
are cooperating with America on this.

33:38.352 --> 33:39.686
"Cooperating"?

33:40.270 --> 33:42.648
What does America care about the Hoshi?

33:42.731 --> 33:44.608
Or her crew?

33:48.779 --> 33:50.614
I know that capsule.

33:51.198 --> 33:52.449
I need equipment,

33:52.533 --> 33:54.910
a portable system to establish
communication with the antenna--

33:54.993 --> 33:57.538
I can't give you JASA equipment.

33:59.456 --> 34:00.666
But…

34:00.749 --> 34:03.460
if you broke in and stole it from me

34:03.544 --> 34:06.964
after I fired you…

34:13.594 --> 34:15.304
You can get into any room with this.

34:18.433 --> 34:21.770
You asked me what I would do
if it were possible to save my wife.

34:24.648 --> 34:25.774
It's obvious.

34:26.817 --> 34:29.235
Anything.

34:31.487 --> 34:32.531
Yamato-san…

34:34.199 --> 34:36.743
don't let anybody get in your way.

34:38.286 --> 34:40.414
Bring her back.

34:49.630 --> 34:56.513
Come on.

35:00.559 --> 35:01.935
Hello?

35:02.019 --> 35:03.645
-Learah?
-Trev?

35:06.607 --> 35:09.526
It's not-- Right.
It's not our regular time.

35:10.152 --> 35:12.279
-We're not in regular times now--
-Are you watching?

35:12.362 --> 35:13.739
…necessary.

35:13.822 --> 35:15.991
So far, there's no official word
from the White House.

35:16.074 --> 35:18.660
-Watching what?
-The TV, all this stuff that's going on.

35:18.744 --> 35:19.745
It's on the TV?

35:20.495 --> 35:21.747
What are they saying?

35:22.414 --> 35:23.916
Why? You know something about it?

35:23.999 --> 35:27.294
…and air traffic control outages
continue to…

35:30.005 --> 35:31.715
-Are you somewhere safe?
-What?

35:32.925 --> 35:35.385
I'm home. Trev, you're scaring me.

35:35.886 --> 35:39.431
Don't be scared. Just listen, okay?
Look, I know where a NATO base is.

35:39.515 --> 35:42.226
Camp Travis is 80 miles away,
just outside Karz.

35:43.101 --> 35:45.521
The last liftoff, okay?
And maybe with the Germans--

35:45.604 --> 35:47.898
I don't think you coming here
is a good idea.

35:52.861 --> 35:55.989
-Trev, please. Don't--
-And I know I haven't been--

35:56.073 --> 35:58.200
Don't-- No, don't-- don't do this.

35:58.283 --> 36:00.202
You ran away. You did.

36:01.537 --> 36:03.413
Just listen.
I just need you to stay there.

36:03.497 --> 36:05.165
Stay safe and listen to me.

36:05.249 --> 36:07.918
-I'm listening, Trev. I'm safe.
-'Cause I'm coming home.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.503
Okay? It won't be the same.

36:09.586 --> 36:12.256
It won't ever be the same.
I know that. But you need to just--

36:12.339 --> 36:13.799
Trev, please.

36:13.882 --> 36:17.010
Breaking from Washington,
rather a secure location,

36:17.094 --> 36:19.096
the president
is about to address the nation.

36:19.179 --> 36:22.432
-Trev? It's the president.
-We go live now to the president.

36:22.975 --> 36:24.893
-What?
-On the TV.

36:25.769 --> 36:28.772
I think she's about to tell us
what the hell's going on. Hold up.

36:31.483 --> 36:32.901
My fellow Americans

36:32.985 --> 36:35.279
and fellow citizens of the world,

36:35.362 --> 36:38.699
this address is being broadcast
in over 100 languages

36:38.782 --> 36:40.367
across every continent.

36:40.868 --> 36:45.414
What I have to say to you is not
something I was ever prepared to say.

36:45.497 --> 36:48.458
And I do not expect you
to be prepared to hear it.

36:48.542 --> 36:50.169
As many of you know by now,

36:51.170 --> 36:53.714
we are suffering from inexplicable

36:53.797 --> 36:56.633
and seemingly unrelated incidents
around the world,

36:57.176 --> 36:59.178
ranging from power outages,

36:59.261 --> 37:03.682
the destruction of communications,
infrastructure and homes.

37:03.765 --> 37:06.393
We now believe
these incidents are not unrelated,

37:06.476 --> 37:08.729
but, in fact, connected.

37:09.563 --> 37:13.567
Connected to signals received by
event horizon telescopes around the world,

37:13.650 --> 37:15.027
all aimed at the sky,

37:15.110 --> 37:18.155
monitoring the stars
and what may lay beyond.

37:19.114 --> 37:20.199
Today…

37:21.992 --> 37:25.996
I am here to tell you
that we are not alone in the universe.

37:26.079 --> 37:31.210
What is being visited upon our Earth
is not of our Earth.

37:31.293 --> 37:32.294
Dear God.

37:32.377 --> 37:34.338
-Protect us from evil.
-We do not yet know

37:34.421 --> 37:37.549
-the purpose or the predisposition…
-Watch over us, God, please.

37:37.633 --> 37:39.218
…of this alien arrival.

37:39.301 --> 37:44.681
So I am hoping we can maintain
our equanimity.

37:44.765 --> 37:45.974
And, more importantly…

37:46.058 --> 37:47.809
The crew perished.

37:47.893 --> 37:49.811
-…our unity.
-The system was attacked.

37:49.895 --> 37:52.356
Now, more than ever…

37:52.439 --> 37:55.234
The US command system is in
an incredibly dangerous situation.

37:55.317 --> 37:59.196
…we must come together regardless of flag,
faction, religion, or race.

37:59.279 --> 38:01.907
For we all belong to one race today.

38:01.990 --> 38:05.035
The human race. We are all--

38:05.118 --> 38:06.745
What Yamato-san is talking about
is Murai-san…

38:06.828 --> 38:08.080
We are all family.

38:08.580 --> 38:09.581
So…

38:12.125 --> 38:13.710
hold your loved ones close.

38:14.419 --> 38:17.214
And do the same
for strangers who need shelter.

38:17.297 --> 38:18.966
US PRESIDENT MAKES STATEMENT
ON THE GLOBAL CRISIS

38:19.550 --> 38:21.009
We need help up here.

38:25.055 --> 38:27.099
Doctor. Doctor.

38:28.851 --> 38:31.395
Listen, we're moving
as many doctors around as we can.

38:31.937 --> 38:34.189
They need emergency help
right up the highway.

38:35.274 --> 38:37.359
A lot more people, a lot less doctors.

38:38.443 --> 38:40.863
Are you ready to move now? Please.

38:40.946 --> 38:43.490
-We need you. Please.
-Are you all right?

38:43.574 --> 38:45.784
I mean-- My God. I don't know what I mean.

38:47.077 --> 38:48.161
We made a vow,

38:48.996 --> 38:52.499
an oath on the Bible, or whatever, right?

38:53.917 --> 38:55.711
It wasn't the Bible.

38:55.794 --> 38:59.339
Whatever it was, we're doctors.
We've already made this choice, right?

39:00.048 --> 39:01.049
Angela?

39:01.133 --> 39:03.135
Ma'am, we need to go now. Please.

39:04.178 --> 39:06.471
Go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's move.

39:09.224 --> 39:12.769
Until further notice,
I am declaring martial law

39:12.853 --> 39:14.813
for the protection of all.

39:16.231 --> 39:19.151
As we leaders around the world
are working to make contact--

39:29.036 --> 39:30.495
I'm coming home.
