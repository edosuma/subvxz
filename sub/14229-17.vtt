01:13.790 --> 01:16.040
Someone has
the carnaval spirit.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.960
Ah, thank you.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.710
And Esteban's
in a good mood, too.

01:20.710 --> 01:22.830
Let me help
you with those.

01:22.830 --> 01:24.790
Carnaval was
Mommy's favorite holiday.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.120
Remember?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.040
How could I forget?

01:28.040 --> 01:30.830
Riding with you
and your mother on
the royal float

01:30.830 --> 01:32.710
was one of my last
happy memories,

01:32.710 --> 01:35.710
before
the dark times.

01:35.710 --> 01:37.960
That's why I brought back
the carnaval,

01:37.960 --> 01:40.040
so we can all make
some more good memories, cousin.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.670
Higgins, stop
fooling around.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.790
ISABEL: Oh, great,
you have the beak.

01:48.790 --> 01:52.620
Yes, yes. Now, where
does it go?

01:52.620 --> 01:53.790
Really?

01:53.790 --> 01:56.040
Just kidding.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.710
But you're never
just kidding.

01:58.710 --> 02:02.000
I think I know who
should be king of
the carnaval, Isabel.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.880
Oh, yeah!

02:04.880 --> 02:06.960
Oh, thank you, Elena.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.960
But I am not worthy
of such an honor.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.960
But you'd finally
be king of something.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.830
Higgins.

02:13.830 --> 02:16.040
Just think about it, okay?

02:16.040 --> 02:17.790
Where's Armando?

02:17.790 --> 02:20.000
He wanted these flowers.
Armando!

02:20.000 --> 02:23.620
- Right here,
Your Highness.
- The beak!

02:23.620 --> 02:25.830
Oh, Armando!

02:25.830 --> 02:27.040
Sorry.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.960
MAN: El Segundo.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.960
Victor?

02:34.790 --> 02:37.790
So you haven't
forgotten me, El Segundo.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.620
They call me
Chancellor Esteban now.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.040
Well, Chancellor Esteban,

02:46.040 --> 02:49.040
that chicken mask
suits you.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.920
It is a phoenix,
and this is not a mask.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.880
Oh, really?

02:53.880 --> 02:55.960
After what
you did to me, old friend,

02:55.960 --> 02:58.670
I would think
you'd be too ashamed
to show your face.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.790
Princess Elena,

03:00.790 --> 03:02.670
you are as beautiful
as ever.

03:02.670 --> 03:04.000
- Pardon me.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.710
It was 41 years ago,
after all,

03:06.710 --> 03:08.790
before Shuriki invaded,

03:08.790 --> 03:10.830
before you were
trapped in that amulet.

03:10.830 --> 03:13.830
My father was
the royal treasurer

03:13.830 --> 03:15.750
when your father
was king.

03:15.750 --> 03:16.880
Victor Delgado?!

03:16.880 --> 03:19.710
Victor Delgado?

03:19.710 --> 03:22.790
Oh, it's been
far too long!

03:22.790 --> 03:24.960
Señor Flores.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.790
Better check
your pockets, abuelo.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.880
Huh

03:28.880 --> 03:32.040
Ah...

03:32.040 --> 03:34.880
Oh, just like
old times, huh?

03:34.880 --> 03:37.790
You and Esteban
loved practicing

03:37.790 --> 03:39.790
your sleight-of-hand
tricks.

03:39.790 --> 03:41.120
Tricks? Huh!

03:41.120 --> 03:43.120
That was their excuse
for taking things

03:43.120 --> 03:44.790
that didn't belong
to them.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.960
Señora Flores.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.710
Please, let me introduce
my daughter.

03:50.710 --> 03:52.830
- Carla.
- It's an honor.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.880
I've heard so much
about all of you.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.710
Where have you been
all these years?

03:57.710 --> 03:59.000
When Shuriki took over,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.120
we had to flee
the kingdom.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.080
We lost everything.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.670
But now that Avalor
is free,

04:05.670 --> 04:07.960
I wanted to show Carla
where I grew up.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.830
That is why
you came back?

04:10.830 --> 04:12.830
And to celebrate
carnaval, of course.

04:12.830 --> 04:15.920
Yes, it is so wonderful
of you to bring back

04:15.920 --> 04:17.920
the old traditions.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.830
Well, how would you
like to be our personal guests

04:20.830 --> 04:22.620
at the carnaval parade today?

04:22.620 --> 04:24.080
I am sure
they have other...

04:24.080 --> 04:26.000
We would love to.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.880
Ooh, can we take a tour
of the palace first?

04:27.880 --> 04:30.620
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

04:30.620 --> 04:31.830
It's like
a fairy tale.

04:31.830 --> 04:34.040
Of course. I'll show you
around myself.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.790
I can't believe
you grew up here, Papa.

04:38.790 --> 04:41.620
Ah, El Segundo
grew up here.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.790
I was merely a visitor.

04:43.790 --> 04:45.080
How did Esteban
get that nickname?

04:45.080 --> 04:46.830
I can't remember.

04:46.830 --> 04:48.960
Well,
when we were young,

04:48.960 --> 04:51.040
we used to race
all over the palace,

04:51.040 --> 04:53.960
and Esteban
always came in second.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.040
Thus, El Segundo.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.750
Yes, well, now that
you have toured the palace,

04:59.750 --> 05:01.040
you should probably
be moving on.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.120
Oh, I'm in no hurry.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.000
And we haven't seen
where Grandfather worked yet.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.880
I am afraid
the royal treasury

05:07.880 --> 05:09.710
is not part
of the tour.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.710
It'll only take
a few minutes, Esteban.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.000
Summon the captain
of the guard.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.670
CARLA: This is all yours?

05:17.670 --> 05:19.920
Well, it belongs to
the kingdom of Avalor.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.960
We're just
the caretakers.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.080
That's what my father
used to say,

05:24.080 --> 05:26.120
until Shuriki threw us
out of the kingdom.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.040
Well, most of us.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.080
That tiara
is my favorite.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.960
It was
my mother's.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.880
But she only wore it
at carnaval.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.750
I remember how
it used to sparkle
in the sun.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.960
We used to ride
together on the float.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.040
One time,
when I was eight,

05:43.040 --> 05:45.710
she even let me
wear the tiara.

05:45.710 --> 05:49.710
That day, I was
the happiest girl
in all of Avalor.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.040
Oh, it's magnificent.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.790
It's even prettier
up close. Come on.

05:53.790 --> 05:56.080
Elena, we cannot go
any closer, remember?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.880
Oh, right.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.920
The whole room
is rigged with booby traps,

05:59.920 --> 06:02.790
you know,
in case of thieves.

06:02.790 --> 06:06.040
Yes, it is the best
system in the world.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.040
No one could possibly
get past it.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.000
Now we should really
go back downstairs.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I am sure Isabel
could use

06:12.000 --> 06:13.750
some assistance
with the float.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.750
I'm so sorry.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.960
I thought we were
going that way.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.960
Entirely my fault,
señorita.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.670
Good job.

06:26.670 --> 06:28.080
Remember the plan.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.710
You keep them distracted
while I steal the jewels.

06:31.710 --> 06:33.080
Mm-hmm.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.620
Oh, if you need
any help with the float,

06:35.620 --> 06:36.880
I'm happy to lend a hand.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.710
Sure.
Grab a brush.

06:38.710 --> 06:40.040
There's one for
Señor Delgado, too.

06:40.040 --> 06:44.000
Oh, I would love to,
but I am very tired

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
from the trip.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.670
Well, you are in luck.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.960
Avalor City
has many fine inns.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.790
Oh, Esteban.

06:52.790 --> 06:54.710
There's only a million
rooms in the palace.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.000
Armando!

06:56.000 --> 06:58.880
- Yes, princess.
- Hey!

06:58.880 --> 07:01.880
- Armando!
- Sorry.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.830
Can you show Victor
to the parlor?

07:03.830 --> 07:06.920
Oh, thank you, but I spent
my childhood in these halls.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.790
I know the way.

07:08.790 --> 07:11.120
Cousin Esteban, could you
put the beak back on?

07:11.120 --> 07:13.620
It keeps coming loose.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.960
Of course, Isabel.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.080
Follow him, Higgins.
I do not trust him.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.920
But you've known him
for ages.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.000
Yes, that is how I know
he's up to no good.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.790
Were you following me?

07:37.790 --> 07:39.000
Me? No.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.670
I was just going
to the... to the, uh...

07:41.670 --> 07:43.830
- Yes! The kitchen.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.710
Wonderful. Perhaps you can
fetch me a torta.

07:46.710 --> 07:48.080
Ham and cheese.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.880
In fact, why don't you
get yourself one while
you're there?

07:50.880 --> 07:53.040
Thanks, Victor.
I could use a snack.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.040
I'll meet you
in the parlor.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.880
I'll be waiting.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.790
Hmph.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.830
You call this
a security system?

08:12.830 --> 08:14.830
Ha! Child's play.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.960
Aah!

08:23.960 --> 08:26.080
Quarter turn
to the left.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.710
Perfect.

08:32.830 --> 08:34.120
Higgins, where is Victor?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.960
I wish I knew.
I have his torta.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.080
His what?!

08:38.080 --> 08:40.000
Ah, I told you
to follow him,

08:40.000 --> 08:41.880
not fix him
a snack.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.750
Give me that.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.880
There's my torta.
Thank you, Esteban.

08:49.750 --> 08:52.790
I have had enough
of your games, Victor.

08:52.790 --> 08:54.790
What are you really
doing here?

08:54.790 --> 08:56.040
Just visiting
old friends.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.960
Ah, is that so?

08:57.960 --> 09:00.750
Looks like someone
set off a booby trap.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.920
You tried to steal
the royal jewels.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.920
That is nothing compared
to what you did to me.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.880
Forty-one years ago,

09:07.880 --> 09:10.080
you and I made
a deal with Shuriki.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.790
We were going to help her
invade Avalor,

09:12.790 --> 09:14.000
and rule the kingdom
with her.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.790
We were partners.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.670
But when Shuriki kicked
me and my family

09:19.670 --> 09:22.670
out of Avalor,
you did nothing
to stop her.

09:22.670 --> 09:23.920
What could I do, eh?

09:23.920 --> 09:25.960
You saw what she did
to Elena's parents.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.750
I had no choice.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.000
You always
have a choice.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.710
For example, I could
tell your family

09:32.710 --> 09:34.120
that you betrayed
them all.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.170
Keep your voice down.

09:38.710 --> 09:39.830
Huh.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.040
Oh, clumsy me.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.880
- Uh, sure.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.750
You cannot
tell them the truth.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.620
Oh, I won't...

09:52.620 --> 09:55.080
if you bring me
the crown jewels.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.120
I... I cannot do this.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.880
Bring me the jewels,

09:59.880 --> 10:02.710
or I tell them
your secret.

10:04.120 --> 10:08.620
Looks like we're partners
once more, El Segundo.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.960
Chancellor.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.000
Okay, get a hold
of yourself.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.830
It's either this,
or they find out the truth.

Oh, there you are.

13:06.830 --> 13:08.790
I've been looking
all over for you.

13:08.790 --> 13:10.670
It's time to go
to the parade.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.790
What are you doing
with my mother's tiara?

13:13.790 --> 13:15.620
Uh, I, uh...

13:15.620 --> 13:17.710
I am bringing
it to you.

13:17.710 --> 13:20.040
Because of that story
you told me about her,

13:20.040 --> 13:23.040
I think you should
wear your mother's tiara today

13:23.040 --> 13:24.880
in her honor.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.670
Oh, and I brought something
for the rest of the family,

13:28.670 --> 13:30.960
so they do not
feel left out.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.920
You look just like
your mother.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.710
I do?

13:40.960 --> 13:42.960
Oh, we should go.
They're waiting.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.880
Thank you, Esteban.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.710
Elena, hurry.
We'll be late.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.670
Coming.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.790
What's she doing
with the tiara?

13:59.790 --> 14:02.000
Carla, Victor,
time to go.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.750
Go. I'll find Esteban.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.880
Ooh, this is
so exciting.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.790
I've never been on
a royal float before.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.000
I told you to
steal the jewels.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.880
I did, but she caught me.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.670
She's handing them out
like candy.

14:20.670 --> 14:22.670
Get those jewels
back, Esteban,

14:22.670 --> 14:24.120
or I'll tell them
what you did.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.080
How, Victor?
They are wearing them.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.120
The way we used to do it.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.710
Our sleight-of-hand tricks.

14:31.710 --> 14:35.080
I'll create a distraction,
and you get the jewels
off them...

14:35.080 --> 14:36.790
partner.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.040
Isabel, Mommy wore this
on your tenth birthday.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.830
Oh, it's beautiful.

14:43.830 --> 14:46.670
Oh, mijito. It was
so sweet of you

14:46.670 --> 14:48.920
to bring out the jewels
for the parade.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.880
Ay, abuela, please.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.960
It's going to be
a long parade,

14:52.960 --> 14:55.790
so I brought
plenty of guava juice.

14:57.710 --> 14:59.790
Andale!

15:03.080 --> 15:05.080
Hang on, abuela,
I've got you.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.040
Steady, abuelo.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.960
Victor, slow down.
It's not a race.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.080
We don't want to be late.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.000
Isabel!

15:25.620 --> 15:27.920
Uh-oh. Isa, the beak
is coming loose.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.880
Don't worry,
I'll fix it.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.920
Okay, that is it.
I have them all.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.080
No, you don't.
The tiara.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.880
But it is
on her head.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.750
There is no way to take it
without everyone seeing.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.790
Get rid of the others.

15:43.790 --> 15:44.880
What?!

15:47.000 --> 15:48.830
Hey, she unhooked
the float.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.620
Why would she
do that?

15:51.920 --> 15:53.750
Adios!

15:53.750 --> 15:55.710
- Carla!

15:55.710 --> 15:57.790
Now, get that tiara.

16:12.830 --> 16:16.960
Now, who would like
some refreshing guava juice?

16:16.960 --> 16:19.000
Elena and Esteban
are in trouble.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.670
We have to help them,
Francisco.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.040
You already have
enough jewels.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.880
Just take them and go.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.000
The tiara is
the only piece that matters.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.960
We're not leaving
without it.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.080
Then you are
not leaving at all.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.920
What are you doing?

16:38.920 --> 16:40.960
What I should've done
in the first place--

16:40.960 --> 16:44.080
making the right choice.
Whoa!

16:45.880 --> 16:47.880
I'm warning you.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.710
I'll tell her everything.

16:49.710 --> 16:52.880
Do what you must.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.710
Ha! Princess.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.790
It's about time
you knew the truth

16:59.790 --> 17:01.790
about your dear
cousin Esteban.

17:01.790 --> 17:04.710
He made a secret deal
with Shuriki

17:04.710 --> 17:06.000
to help her
invade Avalor.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.080
He betrayed
your family.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.920
That is how he
stayed in power

17:10.920 --> 17:12.670
while the rest
of us suffered.

17:12.670 --> 17:14.790
I'll take that.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.750
- Papa!
- No!

17:18.080 --> 17:21.000
- Gracias, Carla.
- No!

17:21.000 --> 17:22.880
Esteban!

17:25.710 --> 17:27.960
You lose again, old friend.

17:30.710 --> 17:31.880
They locked it.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.670
Andale! Rapido.

17:38.790 --> 17:41.040
Elena, about
what Victor said.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.960
There's nothing
to say, Esteban.

17:44.710 --> 17:47.000
I know Victor was just lying
to distract us.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.040
Like you'd ever do
anything to hurt
your own family.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.960
Yes, this is true.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.620
But I do feel bad
for serving Shuriki
all those years.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.620
You had no choice.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.790
That is what
I told myself,

18:01.790 --> 18:04.670
but I have always
felt guilty.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.000
You shouldn't.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.960
You did what you had
to do to survive,

18:07.960 --> 18:10.080
and when the time came,
you stood up to Shuriki,

18:10.080 --> 18:11.790
and helped us
defeat her.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.880
You tried to stop
Victor today.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.080
It's time to put
the past behind you.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.920
You can't change
what you did before,

18:18.920 --> 18:21.000
but you can change
what you do next.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.120
You... you're
right, Elena.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.960
I can.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.830
We must
get out of here.

18:26.830 --> 18:29.790
We cannot let them
get away with this.

18:31.830 --> 18:36.670
Ay! Why did Isabel have to
make this thing so strong?

18:38.750 --> 18:40.880
Except for the beak.

18:46.670 --> 18:47.960
I see them!

18:47.960 --> 18:49.830
But I can't fit.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.040
Wait, wait.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.830
All this rocking
is making the float move.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.880
That's it! Elena,
I know how we can catch them.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.040
Help me get
the float moving.

19:04.920 --> 19:08.920
Just a few...
more... tries.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.040
We did it!

19:13.040 --> 19:15.830
It's moving. Quick,
climb back up the neck.

19:15.830 --> 19:17.830
One of us needs to see
where we are going.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.960
Move, move!

19:27.960 --> 19:29.960
Ah, traffic.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.880
- Lean to the left.
- Leaning left.

19:38.040 --> 19:41.710
- Now hard to the right.
- Hard right.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.000
Carla, they're coming.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.880
Ah, this way.

19:58.710 --> 20:00.040
They're headed
into the park.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.750
Lean left. Now!

20:03.790 --> 20:05.790
They're thieves,
stop them!

20:05.790 --> 20:07.120
Turn this float around.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.080
The Crown Princess
needs us!

20:13.710 --> 20:14.790
Follow me.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.790
Okay, veer right.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.790
Uh-oh.
Brace yourself, Esteban.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.880
Stop right there.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.040
Huh?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.750
Not so fast.

20:54.710 --> 20:57.080
I'll take those...
old friend.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.790
Captain.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.710
Remove these thieves
from our kingdom,

21:02.710 --> 21:04.750
and see that
they never return.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.000
Yes, Your Majesty.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.920
What do we
do now, Papa?

21:10.920 --> 21:12.120
We needed that tiara.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.960
We will find
another way, Carla.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.710
I assure you.

21:16.710 --> 21:20.880
Avalor has not heard
the last of us.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.960
This is where
your mother's tiara belongs.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.750
Thank you, Esteban.

21:27.750 --> 21:28.960
I wish we had
something for you.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.790
We do.

21:32.710 --> 21:34.880
You said you weren't
worthy of this honor,

21:34.880 --> 21:39.790
but I think you've earned
the right to wear the crown.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.960
Chancellor Esteban,

21:42.960 --> 21:45.620
I hereby proclaim you...

21:45.620 --> 21:47.880
king of the carnaval.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.830
Would you like
to do the honors?

21:49.830 --> 21:51.920
Nothing would
please me more.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.920
Let the carnaval parade
begin!
