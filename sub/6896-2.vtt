WEBVTT

00:13.389 --> 00:14.806
Hera, go! We'll cover you!

00:16.266 --> 00:17.475
Kanan, look out!

00:47.464 --> 00:49.882
Your master has deceived you

00:49.967 --> 00:52.760
into believing you can become a Jedi.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.699
Get ready to fly us outta here!

01:33.343 --> 01:35.261
You know what I do
in hopeless situations?

01:35.345 --> 01:37.722
Yeah. Blow stuff up.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.646
Aim for the walkers.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.448
Now!

02:17.930 --> 02:19.472
lf that doesn't kill him, what will?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.057
Not us. Run!

02:26.897 --> 02:28.898
-Go, Chop!
-Come on! Come on!

02:42.788 --> 02:45.832
My lord, I will mobilize
our fighters to pursue.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.501
That will be unnecessary, Commander.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.462
The rebels will not leave the planet yet.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.473
Zeb, make sure they can't track us.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.433
Consider it done.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.435
You all right?

03:06.520 --> 03:07.520
Yeah, I'll live.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.147
Kanan, what was that?

03:10.232 --> 03:11.858
Another Inquisitor?

03:12.401 --> 03:13.609
No.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.820
Something worse.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.196
What?

03:17.281 --> 03:19.031
A Sith Lord.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.075
The ancient enemy of the Jedi.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.869
How do we fight him?

03:22.953 --> 03:26.747
Fight him? Ezra,
we were lucky to survive.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.332
Then that settles it.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.543
I'm going to make for orbit
so we can jump away.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.961
Hera, no.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.755
He will have a blockade of
Destroyers waiting for us.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.176
And this shuttle is slow,
with barely any weapons or shields.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.722
We're gonna have to smuggle
ourselves off Lothal for a change.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.891
That's not a bad idea.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.517
What are you thinkin'?

03:46.602 --> 03:51.063
I'm thinking we know the right man
to smuggle us off-world.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.024
Not him!

03:58.989 --> 04:03.075
My lord, our scans have indicated
that the stolen shuttle

04:03.160 --> 04:05.578
has not attempted to leave the system.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.831
Fear has driven them to ground.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.500
There is a refugee camp

04:11.585 --> 04:14.921
the rebels have provided aid to
in the past.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.924
Yes, "Tarkintown" they call it.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.676
You suspect the rebels
are in hiding there?

04:21.595 --> 04:24.555
No, but I want you to burn it.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.808
The compassion of the rebels
is a weakness.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.269
One we will exploit.

04:30.354 --> 04:31.812
Yes, my lord.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.947
Well, hello there, Captain Syndulla.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.407
This is a pleasant surprise.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.242
What can I do for you?

04:45.327 --> 04:48.579
This isn't a social call, Lando.
It's business.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.873
We need your help
to smuggle something off Lothal.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.625
Past the Imperial blockade.

04:52.709 --> 04:57.296
You know, if the Empire learns
I got involved, it'd be all over for me.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.383
I'd be taking an awful big risk.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.134
What do you want?

05:02.219 --> 05:03.886
What have you got?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.139
Imperial shield generators.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.724
Military grade.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.560
Now that's merchandise I can move.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.145
How many we talking about?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.189
Two.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.524
Two?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.985
You are no gambler, Hera.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.654
Offering me two means
you've got at least six,

05:21.738 --> 05:24.865
so I think, three is probably fair.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.993
Fair? You're taking half.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.912
Those shields won't do you much good
if you're dead.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.665
Three it is. So we have a deal?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.543
While I'm not on Lothal
at the moment, my droid is.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.753
Go to my operation, and he'll set you up

05:37.838 --> 05:39.422
with everything you need.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.310
You must be Lando's droid.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.646
Yes, ma'am. Welcome.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.064
I have prepared everything

05:57.149 --> 05:59.442
according to Calrissian's instructions.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.068
ls one of you a mechanic?

06:01.153 --> 06:02.528
That must be me.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.198
Definitely not you.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.848
-Hey, kid!
-Just let him go, Zeb.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.411
There's no one.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.663
They're all gone.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.625
They're prisoners of the Empire now.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.211
All I sense is evil.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.671
Why would they burn Tarkintown?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.466
To spread fear, make us afraid.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.010
The people that lived here
just got caught in the middle.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.596
This happened because of us?

07:10.680 --> 07:14.016
There's a cost for
any action we take now, Ezra.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.519
Things are getting worse just as
they did back when I was your age.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.937
But back then,

07:18.021 --> 07:20.773
there were 1 0,000 Jedi Knights
protecting the galaxy.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.149
Now...

07:22.901 --> 07:25.236
There's just you and me.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.737
Against an Empire.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.073
We can fight! We have allies.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.117
Do you understand what you're saying?

07:31.201 --> 07:32.701
You saw what we're up against.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.162
-Look!
-I'm not afraid.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.374
That's what worries me.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.723
What happened out there?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.226
The Empire burned Tarkintown.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.563
Did anyone survive?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.107
The population's been taken captive.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.693
Let's go bust 'em out.

08:05.777 --> 08:09.155
-Where's my rifle?
-No. He'd be waiting.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.365
You were right. We have no choice.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.700
We have to leave.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.743
For the good of Lothal.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.121
So what's the plan
for gettin' out of here?

08:17.205 --> 08:19.665
Lando had these old transponders
lying around.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.835
Sabine's gonna tune their signature
codes to match this shuttle's.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.920
Sounds like a lousy Lando plan.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.007
No, it's Lando's gear. It was my plan.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.383
With these transponders beaming out

08:29.467 --> 08:30.926
the same signal as the shuttle,

08:31.011 --> 08:33.179
we should be able to slip by unnoticed.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.556
Sounds like a lousy Sabine plan.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.099
Better than Lando's.

09:05.712 --> 09:09.465
Admiral, I'm scanning a ship
leaving the surface in Sector 4.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.426
Its transponder codes match those
of the stolen Imperial shuttle.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.386
Order all fighters to intercept.

09:14.471 --> 09:18.140
Sir, I'm scanning
the same transponder in Sector 9.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.642
There must be a mistake.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.268
Re-scan.

09:21.353 --> 09:25.648
I'm tracking the identical signal
in Sector 11 and Sector 5.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.778
The Empire's takin' the bait.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.071
Their fighters are splittin' up.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.490
All right. Let's make our run.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.079
We have a TIE reporting in.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.665
It appears to be some kind of device
sending out a signal.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.459
Delta Squadron
is reporting another device.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.253
Order our pilots to destroy them.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.380
The rebels are trying to
mask their escape.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.598
Sir, one of the transponders
is moving into orbit.

09:59.683 --> 10:02.685
-It's breaking out.
-All ships converge on that signal.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.107
Looks like they figured it out.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.984
It's too late, boys.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.031
The signal is gone.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.491
They've jumped.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.663
Never thought I'd say this,

10:22.747 --> 10:24.873
but thank you, Lando Calrissian.

10:28.378 --> 10:31.297
So if we can't go back to Lothal,
where are we going?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.007
What are you talking about?

10:33.091 --> 10:34.675
We're part of the rebellion now.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.386
Are we? Are we all sure about that?

10:37.470 --> 10:40.848
Maybe we could just grab the Ghost
and lay low for a while.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.975
I like fighting with Phoenix Squadron.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.227
Reminds me of the Honor Guard.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.104
Besides, they're counting on us.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.731
Wouldn't be right to abandon them now.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.192
Ezra, what do you think?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.820
We can't help Lothal now,

10:54.904 --> 10:57.656
but I think the rebels
can help us get stronger,

10:57.741 --> 11:00.659
so we can go back and change things.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.162
I think we should stay
with the rebel fleet.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.841
My lord, I regret to inform you

11:15.925 --> 11:17.843
that the rebels have escaped Lothal.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.764
Have my ship prepared.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.603
Agent Kallus, I don't think I understand.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.146
There is a tracking device

11:29.230 --> 11:31.273
hidden aboard that shuttle.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.567
Now, ready the fleet to deploy.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.331
Phoenix Home,
this is Ghost away team.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.376
Clearance code 1-2-1-8-1-5.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.712
Your clearance code checks out.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.672
Welcome home, Ghost team.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.274
Chopper said a transmitter
activated on our shuttle moments ago.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.401
What does that mean?

12:15.485 --> 12:17.486
It means the Empire
tracked us back to the fleet.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.573
Commander Sato!

12:21.658 --> 12:23.075
We need the fleet to jump out of here.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.660
Our shuttle was tracked.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.663
Commander, I'm scanning
a ship entering our sector.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.050
We're tracking one target.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.635
No other ships
have entered the system.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.762
Move Phoenix Squadron to intercept.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.331
Fighter coming in at mark 3.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.386
He's coming in too fast!

13:24.471 --> 13:26.138
Fleet, raise deflector shields.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.723
We've lost Phoenix 1 and 2.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.482
He's heading right for us.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.358
Enemy fighter's making for
the command ship.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.990
How can one fighter
best our entire squadron?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.159
Your pilots
are outmatched, Commander.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.912
What are you doing?

13:50.872 --> 13:52.372
Getting involved.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.043
Not without me, you're not.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.628
Let's go.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.588
Ezra, come on!

14:00.256 --> 14:02.674
All right if I tag along?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.426
The more, the merrier.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.364
Everyone, check in.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.491
-Tail gun, check!
-Turret, check!

14:27.575 --> 14:29.660
Nose gun, check! Check!

14:29.744 --> 14:31.453
All right, kids, do Mom and Dad proud.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.621
Here he comes.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.919
We've lost our shields!

14:39.003 --> 14:40.879
Ghost moving to engage.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.970
I'm on him!

14:50.306 --> 14:51.557
Who is this guy?

14:52.809 --> 14:54.726
Sir, the last attack
damaged the hyperdrive core!

14:54.811 --> 14:56.520
We are dead in space.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.938
Phoenix Home to Ghost.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.566
We can't withstand another attack
from that fighter.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.652
Copy that. Phoenix Squadron,
form up and focus fire.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.243
The Force is strong with him.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.287
Kanan, let's find out how strong.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.290
-How can I help?
-Just remember your training.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.216
Enemy ship closing to attack range.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.350
There's something familiar.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.103
I feel... Cold.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.522
I think I know who it is.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.610
Back on Lothal I felt something.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.944
Kanan did too.

15:48.323 --> 15:52.576
The fear. The anger. The hate.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.872
It's the Sith Lord we faced.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.207
The apprentice lives.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.462
Ahsoka?

16:08.593 --> 16:11.053
The Imperial pilot broke off his attack!
They did it!

16:11.137 --> 16:13.430
Captain Syndulla,
whatever you're doing, keep it up!

16:13.514 --> 16:15.057
-The fleet can recover!
-No!

16:15.141 --> 16:17.142
Commander, you need to
get the fleet out of here now!

16:17.226 --> 16:19.728
I will not abandon our command ship.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.066
You don't have a choice, sir.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.526
Without a hyperdrive,
you must abandon ship.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.029
Sir, we have Star Destroyers
in Sector 5.

16:31.949 --> 16:35.077
Lord Vader, we have entered
the system and await your orders.

16:36.037 --> 16:38.330
Move your Destroyers
to block their escape,

16:38.414 --> 16:39.873
but hold your fire.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.668
I want these rebels alive.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.630
It's now or never, Commander.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.548
I regretfully agree.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.509
All hands, abandon ship.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.469
You'll have to
keep that fighter occupied.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.679
Don't worry, sir.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.555
We seem to have his attention.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.607
Suddenly, there's a lot to do back here.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.234
Sorry to spoil your fun, Zeb,

17:07.318 --> 17:10.070
but I'm ordering Chopper
to divert all power to the hyperdrive,

17:10.154 --> 17:11.613
including cannons.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.200
Hera, what are you doing?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.119
I think I know.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.165
Admiral, Lord Vader
has separated one of the rebel ships

17:22.250 --> 17:23.542
from the rest of the fleet.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.419
Then that is our primary target.

17:29.924 --> 17:32.175
Ghost crew,
the escape pods are secure.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.219
Fleet, commence hyperspace jump.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.972
Copy that, Commander.
We'll meet you at safe haven.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.229
The fleet is away. Get us out of here!

17:44.313 --> 17:45.772
Everyone, hang on.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.114
Chopper, angle all deflectors astern.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.701
The Star Destroyers
aren't the ones firing at us!

17:57.785 --> 17:58.994
Now, do it fast!

18:00.371 --> 18:02.247
Target moving into range.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.666
Activate tractor beam on my signal.

18:06.878 --> 18:07.961
Hera!

18:08.045 --> 18:09.296
Wait.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.547
Wait...

18:17.180 --> 18:18.346
-Now.
-Gotcha.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.895
Status report on the rebel craft.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.105
Sir, we've locked onto a ship,

18:27.190 --> 18:28.774
but it's not the rebel craft.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.901
It's Lord Vader's ship.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.990
Release... Release him immediately.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.245
It's not your fault, Officer.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.706
But Lord Vader won't know that.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.886
Ahsoka, Hera said
you wanted to speak with us.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.137
Please, come in.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.430
Are you okay?

19:00.515 --> 19:02.140
I am, thank you.

19:02.225 --> 19:05.185
I wanted to ask about the Sith Lord
you encountered on Lothal.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.646
You know we encountered
an Inquisitor before,

19:07.730 --> 19:09.773
but this was nothing like that.

19:09.857 --> 19:13.318
The fear, the anger, the hate.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.694
You felt it.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.488
I haven't sensed
a presence like that since...

19:16.572 --> 19:18.031
The Clone Wars.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.908
Yeah.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.745
Ahsoka, do you know
who or what he is?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.415
No, I don't.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.252
But I do know that he will be coming.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.254
They'll all be coming now.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.548
Then we've got to be ready to fight.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.883
We must find the strength to fight,

19:36.968 --> 19:40.095
but the greater courage
is knowing when not to fight.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.598
And we'll be beside you either way.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.119
With their command ship destroyed,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.329
the rebel fleet has been shattered.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.831
You have them on the run...

20:07.915 --> 20:09.541
Clear the bridge.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.440
Lord Vader, have you dealt with

20:33.524 --> 20:35.942
the rebels in the Lothal system?

20:36.694 --> 20:38.528
Yes, Master.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.488
They are broken.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.949
And yet I sense in you

20:43.034 --> 20:46.661
something more to your victory.

20:47.371 --> 20:52.000
I believe the apprentice
of Anakin Skywalker lives

20:52.084 --> 20:55.086
and is in league with these rebels.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.340
Are you certain?

20:58.883 --> 21:00.258
It was her.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.472
This is an opportunity
we cannot let pass.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.016
Skywalker's apprentice

21:08.100 --> 21:11.478
could lead us to other lost Jedi.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.356
Such as Kenobi.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.275
Perhaps, if he lives.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.111
Be patient, my old friend.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.156
For now, dispatch another Inquisitor

21:23.240 --> 21:25.241
to hunt them down.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.912
As you wish, my master.
