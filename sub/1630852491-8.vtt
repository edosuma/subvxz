of you seen Cassidy?

09:28.871 --> 09:30.106
GROSS:
In the back.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.943
By the Bobcat.

09:36.018 --> 09:37.154
KEVIN:
Hey!

09:38.289 --> 09:41.696
-What the hell happened?
-CASSIDY: Oh, good
to see you, too.

09:41.730 --> 09:43.667
I know, Matty's getting so big.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.671
It's just crazy,
time just flies.

09:45.704 --> 09:47.708
-How was your flight?
-Cassidy.

09:48.376 --> 09:50.013
Hey.

09:50.046 --> 09:51.382
(engine stops)

09:51.415 --> 09:53.119
We had a little setback.

09:53.152 --> 09:54.989
A little setback... Oh, you
know, when I asked you to hire

09:55.023 --> 09:56.993
a couple of workers, I meant
real construction workers.

09:57.027 --> 09:58.764
You know? Not just some
clowns off the street.

09:58.797 --> 10:00.701
Yeah, they're not clowns,
they're vets.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.070
Yeah, who've done
a lot harder jobs

10:02.104 --> 10:04.241
than building cabins
with bidets for movie stars.

10:04.274 --> 10:05.744
-(laughs)
-What?

10:05.778 --> 10:07.615
Sorry, you just called Kevin
a movie star.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.750
(laughs)

10:08.784 --> 10:10.053
CASSIDY:
Your architect's scales

10:10.086 --> 10:12.090
were incorrect
for the back room,

10:12.124 --> 10:13.894
but I should have caught it
before we started to pour.

10:13.927 --> 10:15.898
-It's my bad.
-Yeah, obviously.

10:15.931 --> 10:17.802
-Oh, come on, cool it.
-I am cool.

10:17.835 --> 10:19.271
Just what-what is this?
What am I looking at?

10:19.304 --> 10:21.643
-Does this set us back
a week, a month?
-CASSIDY: Hey.

10:21.676 --> 10:23.279
You don't pay me enough
to take this crap.

10:23.312 --> 10:25.718
I need to get back to work.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.162
-The hell's her problem?
-Her problem?

10:31.195 --> 10:34.067
Oh, I don't know. Kid's not
taking the divorce well,

10:34.101 --> 10:37.040
I hear her pacing the halls
at night when she crashes here.

10:37.073 --> 10:39.011
And she devoted
her adult life to a war

10:39.044 --> 10:41.148
that just ended
with an apology and a fart.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.720
So, you know,
that kind of stuff.

10:43.754 --> 10:45.658
She's busting her ass
for you, kid.

10:45.691 --> 10:48.062
-We're all busting our ass here.
-I know.

10:48.095 --> 10:48.697
I know.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.300
And you're right. I'm sorry.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.903
It's just...

10:51.937 --> 10:54.107
I'm sort of a stressed-out
parent myself, you know?

10:54.141 --> 10:55.911
No, no, you're an idiot.

10:55.945 --> 10:58.149
I mean, why-why didn't
you just fly Mary Poppins

10:58.182 --> 11:00.253
out here on, you know,
one of your Learjets?

11:00.286 --> 11:03.760
-No, because I can do this.
-(stifled laugh)

11:05.363 --> 11:07.668
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:07.702 --> 11:10.173

11:28.911 --> 11:31.716
You want to go...
I'll go that way.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.754
Can't imagine why you two
didn't work out.

11:33.787 --> 11:35.724
Uh-huh.

11:36.392 --> 11:40.099
Hey, listen, um,
I just wanted to say...

11:40.133 --> 11:44.074
I'm sorry about,
you know, being a dick earlier.

11:45.009 --> 11:48.115
Uh, you mean, like, an hour ago,
or, like, since I met you?

11:48.149 --> 11:49.852
Like, an hour ago.

11:51.055 --> 11:53.927
Mm. Sorry for
the foundation screwup.

11:53.961 --> 11:55.731
Is that "sorry for
the foundation screwup"

11:55.764 --> 11:58.069
or "sorry for the foundation,
Screwup"?

11:58.102 --> 11:59.939
Can it be both?

12:04.348 --> 12:05.784
(clears throat)

12:05.818 --> 12:06.987
Oh, can I sit there?

12:07.020 --> 12:09.124
You want to sit here?
Yeah, sure.

19:13.134 --> 19:14.069
When the doctors
are done with her,

19:14.102 --> 19:15.506
they'll come out to you.

19:15.539 --> 19:17.977
Uh, we were told that
she's conscious and talking?

19:18.010 --> 19:21.116
A seat. Over there.

19:21.150 --> 19:22.419
Thanks.

19:23.321 --> 19:25.124
This whole thing
could be my fault.

19:25.158 --> 19:26.427
-What?
-I mean, the way

19:26.461 --> 19:27.663
I jumped all over her
about the jackhammering.

19:27.696 --> 19:29.433
You know,
I'm an addict myself, I...

19:29.467 --> 19:30.636
should have known
better than that.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.073
Maybe she, you know,
couldn't sleep

19:33.107 --> 19:36.614
and caved in, had a few drinks,
got behind the wheel.

19:36.648 --> 19:38.618
Yeah, you give yourself
too much credit.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.724
Here.

19:41.758 --> 19:43.361
You're friends of the patient
Cassidy Sharp?

19:43.395 --> 19:45.599
-Yeah, how is she?
-She's resting now.

19:45.632 --> 19:47.536
Though uncomfortably.
She refused any painkillers,

19:47.570 --> 19:48.405
except Tylenol.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.776
Well, yeah,
she's a recovering addict.

19:50.809 --> 19:52.680
Yeah, sh-she made that clear.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.517
And there was
no alcohol involved?

19:54.550 --> 19:56.454
No, none in her system.
She's gonna be okay.

19:56.487 --> 19:59.025
She suffered a fractured
clavicle and broken arm.

19:59.059 --> 20:00.762
The humerus bone.

20:00.796 --> 20:02.433
Maybe she went to get ice cream.

20:02.466 --> 20:03.635
You know?
It's late, nothing's open.

20:03.668 --> 20:05.772
She got tired and she...

20:05.806 --> 20:07.208
She's gonna be okay, though?

20:07.242 --> 20:08.645
Yes. Yes.
From what I understand,

20:08.678 --> 20:11.551
the pole took the worst of it.
It was a direct hit.

20:11.584 --> 20:13.755
But we're gonna keep an eye
on her overnight, maybe two.

20:13.788 --> 20:15.291
She's sleeping now.

20:15.325 --> 20:16.661
And given that she didn't
want a pain sedative,

20:16.694 --> 20:19.165
that sleep's gonna be
very important to her.

20:19.199 --> 20:21.036
And her doctor.

20:21.069 --> 20:23.441
So I suggest you come back
in the morning, okay?

20:23.475 --> 20:25.244
-KEVIN: Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

20:25.278 --> 20:26.748
Very much.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.522
-Thank God.
-Yeah.

20:39.893 --> 20:41.412
Look, a broken arm, broken clavicle,

20:41.412 --> 20:44.350
it's not like it's nothing,
but she's sober.

20:45.424 --> 20:47.792
And she's refusing
her pain medications,

20:47.825 --> 20:49.729
so that's good, right?

20:52.568 --> 20:54.739
Lighten up.
She's gonna be all right.

20:56.309 --> 20:57.879
"Lighten up," he says.

20:59.181 --> 21:02.187
Do you know what she did
in Afghanistan?

21:02.855 --> 21:05.861
Human intelligence. That means

21:05.895 --> 21:08.867
every day
that she went out in the field,

21:08.901 --> 21:12.140
she'd visit, uh,
some poor villager's house,

21:12.174 --> 21:15.681
and she'd say,
"As long as you help us,

21:15.715 --> 21:17.819
"we will protect you.

21:17.852 --> 21:19.723
We will get you
out of the country."

21:20.511 --> 21:23.183
Sometimes she even meant it.

21:23.217 --> 21:25.187
But even if she didn't,

21:25.221 --> 21:27.358
that's the job.

21:27.391 --> 21:29.429
Um... you sell it.

21:30.231 --> 21:33.504
-She-she didn't seem
that off to me, honestly.
-Oh,

21:33.537 --> 21:35.541
that's right. I forgot.
You went to Vietnam.

21:35.574 --> 21:37.411
You got yourself
a little necklace, right?

21:37.445 --> 21:39.249
Yeah, you're the expert.

21:39.282 --> 21:41.118
Look, people like Cassidy,

21:41.153 --> 21:44.292
they don't give you a heads-up
when they're not okay.

21:44.325 --> 21:46.997
You find out the hard way.

21:47.030 --> 21:48.600
You understand?

21:50.738 --> 21:54.946
At dinner, she didn't sit
with her back to the door.

21:54.979 --> 21:56.450
Now, I've seen that before.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.656
I've been that before.

22:01.526 --> 22:03.530
You don't just...

22:03.564 --> 22:05.701
get better.

22:05.734 --> 22:08.273
And if you think
I'm exaggerating,

22:08.307 --> 22:11.011
let me remind you
that your father

22:11.045 --> 22:13.484
drank in secret
trying to forget.

22:14.319 --> 22:17.191
Let me remind you
when you busted into my trailer,

22:17.225 --> 22:19.996
there was a gun
sitting in front of me.

22:20.664 --> 22:24.539
That was 50 years
after boots left Vietnam.

22:29.415 --> 22:31.253
(exhales)
Look, let's just go.

22:31.286 --> 22:34.024
I mean, you heard the doctor.
We'll go out, we'll come back

22:34.057 --> 22:36.530
-fresh and early.
-Whoa, whoa, I... It's...
You know, maybe...

22:36.563 --> 22:39.169
Should one of us stay?

22:39.202 --> 22:41.473
You want to stay?

22:41.506 --> 22:44.479
-Me?
-Well, you're her friend,

22:44.512 --> 22:46.216
-right?
-Yeah.

22:46.249 --> 22:48.253
Course. I just...

22:48.287 --> 22:50.491
I understand
it's the right thing to do.

22:50.524 --> 22:52.995
I just... I don't know if I'm...

22:53.029 --> 22:57.037
if I'm the right guy
to-to do it.

23:00.678 --> 23:02.782
Don't try to help her,
all right?

23:02.815 --> 23:06.556
Okay? You-you just being here,
that's enough.

23:06.590 --> 23:09.696
Just do nothing. Just...

23:09.729 --> 23:11.733
Just be.

23:12.735 --> 23:14.239
Just be.

the doctor's orders, you know?

26:36.376 --> 26:37.878
You're trying to do
the right thing.

26:37.912 --> 26:41.486

it's the right thing to do.

Yes, he did.

Kev, the last thing
your dad wants to do

28:47.938 --> 28:49.542
is drown you.

28:49.575 --> 28:52.147
The first thing he wants to do
is teach you how to swim

28:52.181 --> 28:53.884

35:34.352 --> 35:36.456
to visit your mom
on your way out of town, okay?

35:36.490 --> 35:39.963
Your dad said it's cool.
Said he wants to see her, too.

35:39.996 --> 35:42.402
Does she look bad?

35:42.435 --> 35:44.306
Your mom? No.

35:44.339 --> 35:47.178
No, your mom...
your mom could never look bad.

35:47.211 --> 35:50.184
And it's gonna take more than a
fender bender to keep her down.

35:50.217 --> 35:53.757
But I think it would
cheer her up to see you.

35:58.066 --> 36:01.038
You know, when I was
at the hospital last night,

36:01.072 --> 36:02.442
I was visiting your mom.

36:03.243 --> 36:05.314
And I was gonna buy her
a get-well card,

36:05.348 --> 36:07.251
but everything they had
was kind of lame.

36:07.285 --> 36:08.854
You know? It was cheesy.

36:08.887 --> 36:12.328
So, I was thinking
maybe you and I

36:12.362 --> 36:14.499
work together, and we build her
a card of our own.

36:14.532 --> 36:16.803
What do you think
about that? Hmm?

36:16.837 --> 36:18.006
All right.

36:18.039 --> 36:20.544
But I'm no good at painting.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.317
Oh, no, it doesn't matter.
You don't have to be good.

36:23.350 --> 36:25.921
You know,
when I first started acting,

36:25.955 --> 36:28.527
every time I got a new role,
I would paint.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.366
I would go buy a bunch of paint
and just-just have at it.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.935
Freed up my mind.

36:32.969 --> 36:34.973
But, uh, you know,

36:35.006 --> 36:38.147
then I got self-conscious,
and I quit.

36:38.180 --> 36:41.219
Picked up other hobbies,
like the guitar.

36:44.859 --> 36:46.363
Want to help?

36:47.598 --> 36:50.304
-I said okay, like, an hour ago.
-(laughs)

36:51.606 --> 36:53.610
Yeah. Yeah, don't be shy.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.915
Get in there. Blue?

36:55.948 --> 36:58.153
-You like blue? All right.
-Yeah.

36:58.187 --> 36:59.989
-Get some green.
-Green. Green and blue.

37:00.023 --> 37:01.426
-Let's do them both. Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.130
-KEVIN: Ooh.
-MATTY: Blue's
my mom's favorite color.

37:03.163 --> 37:05.100
KEVIN:
Get out of here.

37:05.134 --> 37:08.374
Blue is my favorite color.

37:27.678 --> 37:29.349

37:30.351 --> 37:32.388
Thank you.

37:39.068 --> 37:42.642
So, how's the foundation coming,
Studenmund?

37:42.675 --> 37:44.312
He's Studenmund. I'm Gross.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.216
Oh, no, you're not.
You're just a little dirty.

37:46.249 --> 37:47.452
But, you know,
you're working construction,

37:47.485 --> 37:50.558
so it's to be... figured.
It was a joke.

37:50.591 --> 37:52.428
-Cute.
-KEVIN: Thanks.

37:52.462 --> 37:55.234
After the inspection, we'll
start framing by end of week.

37:55.267 --> 37:56.970
-Great.
-GROSS: Good.

37:57.003 --> 37:57.972
Where'd you all learn
how to build, anyway?

37:58.005 --> 37:59.175
STUDENMUND:
Seabees.

If you decide you want to build

38:02.415 --> 38:04.285
another cabin,
you know who to call.

38:04.319 --> 38:08.160
-Yeah? Okay. Thank you.
-All right.

38:08.193 --> 38:10.096
KEVIN:
Wow.

CASSIDY:
Guys, come on.

38:17.445 --> 38:19.081
I'll be fine.
I've been through worse,

38:19.114 --> 38:21.051
-trust me.
-NICKY: No.

38:21.085 --> 38:23.657
No, you haven't.

38:23.690 --> 38:25.194
I spoke to the VA.

38:25.227 --> 38:27.131
They have a specialist,

38:27.165 --> 38:30.938
a readjustment counselor
that you can speak to.

38:30.971 --> 38:32.508
She's good.

38:32.542 --> 38:34.512
I spoke to her.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.501
Your grandpa used to love
sitting up here.

38:45.534 --> 38:48.507
He'd sit out here,
taking in the world, you know?

38:52.248 --> 38:53.517
You know your cousin
was named after him?

38:53.550 --> 38:56.490
Did you know that? Huh?
Can you say "Jack"?

38:56.523 --> 38:58.127
Can you say "Jack"?

38:58.160 --> 39:00.498
Anyway, for your grandfather,

39:00.531 --> 39:03.504
having the tough childhood
that he... that he did,

39:03.537 --> 39:08.180
I think building that cabin
was sort of a pipe dream.

39:11.118 --> 39:13.357
(breathes deeply)

39:13.390 --> 39:15.327
But he would have built it.

39:19.402 --> 39:22.542
He would have built it
if he'd just had the time.

39:22.575 --> 39:25.581
-Up. Up.
-KATE: Thank you.

39:36.035 --> 39:38.340

39:38.373 --> 39:40.109

39:40.144 --> 39:41.780
All right, yeah.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.317
We're gonna put it
right up there.

39:43.350 --> 39:45.119
We're gonna
put it right up there.

39:46.823 --> 39:49.162
(vehicle approaching)

39:52.201 --> 39:54.405
-Hi. Straight back.
-Bring her in.

39:54.439 --> 39:55.708
-Careful, careful, careful.
-Here she comes.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.545
Okay. I'm all right.
My legs aren't broken.

39:57.578 --> 39:59.582
Well, it's good to see
the hospital mellowed you out.

40:03.624 --> 40:05.561
It's awfully quiet.
What'd you do, fire my crew?

40:05.594 --> 40:07.698
(chuckles): No. No, that's
the sound of work being done,

40:07.732 --> 40:09.302
not redone.

40:09.335 --> 40:12.375
Ah, ah, ah.
Where you going?

40:13.443 --> 40:15.046
You're this way.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.550

Go on.

40:16.583 --> 40:18.620
Got you set up here.
You'll have

40:18.654 --> 40:20.624
-the whole room
to yourself, so...

built schools in war zones?

40:36.222 --> 40:38.227
Yeah. Why do you think
we hired 'em?

40:40.331 --> 40:41.733
I think we should
hire a few more.

40:41.766 --> 40:44.472
-CASSIDY: Few more what?
-More of your guys and gals.

40:44.505 --> 40:47.178
I think we should
hire more vets.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.114
That's great, Kev,
but we've already got

40:49.148 --> 40:51.186
enough workers for the house.
