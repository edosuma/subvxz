WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:02.602
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.602 --> 00:03.604
DADDY!

00:03.604 --> 00:05.136
(Emily) WHEN I WAS A CHILD,

00:05.136 --> 00:06.307
MY FATHER WAS FRAMED FOR
A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

00:06.307 --> 00:07.478
DADDY!

00:07.478 --> 00:08.639
AMANDA!

00:08.639 --> 00:10.010
DAD THREW US A CURVEBALL.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.182
I WON'T BE FULLY VESTED
IN THE COMPANY

00:11.182 --> 00:12.143
UNTIL I GET MARRIED.

00:12.143 --> 00:13.484
I LOVE HER, SO WHY WAIT?

00:13.484 --> 00:14.645
(Mason) YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU, AMANDA?

00:14.645 --> 00:16.187
SHOULD I?

00:16.187 --> 00:17.318
I INTERVIEWED YOU FOR MY BOOK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.050
(Emily) QUITE THE COLLECTION.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.352
(Mason) HUNDREDS OF HOURS
OF ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS.

00:21.352 --> 00:22.423
(clicks)

00:22.423 --> 00:25.126
NO! (cries) NO!

00:25.126 --> 00:28.199
VICTORIA GAVE BIRTH
TO A BABY GIRL--CHARLOTTE.

00:28.199 --> 00:30.161
ASK HER WHO THE FATHER IS.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.664
(Emily) SOME SAY
THAT OUR LIVES ARE DEFINED

00:33.664 --> 00:37.068
BY THE SUM OF OUR CHOICES.

00:37.068 --> 00:40.071
BUT IT ISN'T REALLY OUR CHOICES
THAT DISTINGUISH WHO WE ARE.

00:40.071 --> 00:42.042
IT'S OUR COMMITMENT TO THEM.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.317
VICTORIA ONLY CAME
TO THE COURTROOM TWICE.

00:46.317 --> 00:48.119
ONCE FOR THE DAY
OF HER TESTIMONY,

00:48.119 --> 00:51.051
AND THEN... ON THE DAY
THAT I WAS SENTENCED.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.084
ON THAT DAY,
SHE BROUGHT THE BABY--

00:53.084 --> 00:54.785
CHARLOTTE--

00:54.785 --> 00:56.287
SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:56.287 --> 00:58.629
HER EYES WERE SO FAMILIAR.

00:58.629 --> 01:00.691
I BARELY HEARD THE JUDGE
WHEN HE TOLD ME

01:00.691 --> 01:04.063
THAT I WOULD NEVER
LEAVE THIS PRISON ALIVE.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.767
LOSING AMANDA
WAS HARD ENOUGH.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.569
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING
TWO DAUGHTERS AT ONCE,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.101
IT WAS...

01:10.101 --> 01:13.474
IT WAS UNBEARABLE.

01:13.474 --> 01:17.248
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.

01:18.349 --> 01:20.151
WHOA.

01:21.512 --> 01:24.415
SO CHARLOTTE GRAYSON
IS YOUR SISTER?

01:24.415 --> 01:26.357
IF MY FATHER WAS RIGHT.

01:26.357 --> 01:28.119
BUT WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS,

01:28.119 --> 01:29.690
WHY WOULDN'T HE WRITE THAT
IN HIS JOURNALS?

01:29.690 --> 01:32.693
WHY TRUST TREADWELL WITH THAT
INFORMATION AND NO ONE ELSE?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.165
MAYBE HE WASN'T CERTAIN.

01:34.165 --> 01:36.167
WHICH IS WHY
I'M GONNA FIND OUT

01:36.167 --> 01:38.369
OR THE GRAYSONS
ARE GONNA FIND OUT FOR ME.

01:38.369 --> 01:40.171
OKAY, I'LL BITE.

01:40.171 --> 01:42.173
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE TAPES?

01:42.173 --> 01:44.835
ONE OF THEM'S GONNA
BLOW UP VICTORIA'S DIVORCE.

01:44.835 --> 01:46.707
THE OTHER ONES
ARE GONNA BE FOUND ON AMANDA.

01:46.707 --> 01:50.211
TO FRAME HER FOR TORCHING
CASA TREADWELL?

01:50.211 --> 01:52.713
SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME
MUCH CHOICE.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.884
(whirs and clicks)

01:53.884 --> 01:56.187
SO THE FACT THAT CHARLOTTE

01:56.187 --> 01:58.149
MIGHT BE YOUR SISTER

01:58.149 --> 02:00.291
MAKES ABSOLUTELY
NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU?

02:00.291 --> 02:02.693
HALF SISTER, AND...

02:02.693 --> 02:04.255
NO, IT DOESN'T.

02:04.255 --> 02:06.227
WHAT ABOUT JACK?

02:06.227 --> 02:08.158
JACK IS IN LOVE
WITH A KILLER.

02:08.158 --> 02:09.800
I'VE GOTTA GET RID
OF AMANDA.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.862
WELL, HE THINKS
HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

02:11.862 --> 02:15.135
MEANWHILE, POOR PUPPY DOG DANIEL
ACTUALLY IS.

02:15.135 --> 02:19.170
SO WHERE, PRAY TELL, DOES
YOUR HEART STAND IN ALL THIS?

02:19.170 --> 02:22.213
MY FEELINGS ARE IRRELEVANT.

02:22.213 --> 02:24.275
LOOK, I CAME HERE FOR REVENGE,
AND YOU OFFERED TO HELP.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.317
IF YOU
CAN'T STOMACH IT ANYMORE,

02:26.317 --> 02:27.648
THEN HOW ABOUT
YOU AT LEAST SPARE ME

02:27.648 --> 02:29.450
YOUR PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
JUDGMENTS?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.782
(tapes clatter)

02:31.782 --> 02:33.824
CONRAD'S GOT A HALF DOZEN
OFFSHORE ENTITIES

02:33.824 --> 02:37.288
HOLDING MULTICURRENCY BANK
ACCOUNTS IN DENMARK AND SPAIN.

02:37.288 --> 02:38.929
YOU GOT A BALLPARK?

02:38.929 --> 02:40.561
$500 MILLION
GIVE OR TAKE.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.233
(Victoria)
WHEN WERE THEY ESTABLISHED?

02:42.233 --> 02:43.534
(Daniel)
WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS.

02:43.534 --> 02:46.597
MAKING THEM COMMUNITY PROPERTY
NOW THAT WE VOIDED THE PRENUP.

02:46.597 --> 02:49.200
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
HE'S WITHHOLDING.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.501
THE S.E.C.
IS SNIFFING AROUND,

02:50.501 --> 02:52.172
LOOKING AT THE COMPANY'S
TRADING PRACTICES.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.674
SO THERE'S
A BIT OF A TICKING CLOCK

02:53.674 --> 02:55.175
TO GET WHATEVER LIQUID ASSETS
WE CAN

02:55.175 --> 02:57.508
BEFORE A POTENTIAL SCANDAL
BLOWS UP.

02:57.508 --> 02:59.480
I TOLD YOU,
DANIEL WOULD COME THROUGH.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.912
THIS SHOULD MAKE TODAY'S
MEDIATION SESSION

03:01.912 --> 03:03.684
ALL THE MORE INTERESTING.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.956
VICTORIA.

03:05.956 --> 03:08.219
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR FATHER'S DECEIT

03:08.219 --> 03:10.221
IS GOOD NEWS FOR BOTH OF US.

03:10.221 --> 03:11.362
MM. HOW SO?

03:11.362 --> 03:12.693
BECAUSE THANKS TO YOU,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.194
I'M POISED TO GET
WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.696
AND YOU WON'T HAVE GO THROUGH
YOUR IMPETUOUS PLAN

03:15.696 --> 03:17.498
TO MARRY EMILY.

03:19.870 --> 03:21.232
MOM...

03:21.232 --> 03:23.234
EVEN IF MARRYING HER
DIDN'T ACTIVATE MY TRUST,

03:23.234 --> 03:24.875
I'D STILL DO IT.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.377
I LOVE HER, MOM.

03:26.377 --> 03:28.709
AND IF YOU TRULY CARE
ABOUT MY HAPPINESS,

03:28.709 --> 03:31.782
YOU'LL FIND A WAY
TO LOVE HER, TOO.

03:31.782 --> 03:34.385
(laughter)

03:34.385 --> 03:35.446
(Jack speaks indistinctly)

03:35.446 --> 03:37.448
(Amanda) WHOO!

03:37.448 --> 03:40.621
(laughs)

03:44.355 --> 03:45.526
HEY.

03:47.398 --> 03:50.261
HEARD YOU GUYS
WENT TO PAINT THE TOWN.

03:50.261 --> 03:51.602
YOU MADE IT BACK
JUST BEFORE THE STORM.

03:51.602 --> 03:53.264
HOW WAS ATLANTIC CITY?

03:53.264 --> 03:55.406
WENT BIG, LOST BIG.

03:55.406 --> 03:57.308
EMPHASIS ON THE LOST...

03:57.308 --> 03:59.310
AND THE BIG.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.011
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:01.011 --> 04:03.013
UH, WELL,
AMANDA AND I MADE PLANS

04:03.013 --> 04:05.346
TO GO FOR BREAKFAST
LAST WEEK.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.818
WONDERED IF YOU'D FORGET.

04:07.818 --> 04:10.250
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT BREAKFAST--

04:10.250 --> 04:12.653
THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL
OF THE DAY.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.385
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:14.385 --> 04:16.427
(Jack) ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YOU TWO GO AHEAD AND HAVE FUN.

04:16.427 --> 04:17.658
(blows kiss) OKAY.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.290
OKAY, WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT

04:19.290 --> 04:21.632
THAT YOU COULDN'T WAIT
UNTIL I WAS ON DRY LAND?

04:21.632 --> 04:24.264
MASON TREADWELL'S HOUSE
BURNED TO THE GROUND

04:24.264 --> 04:26.467
THE NIGHT THAT YOU LEFT TOWN.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.838
WOW.

04:27.838 --> 04:29.370
KARMA REALLY IS A BITCH.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.971
MORE LIKE
VICTORIA GRAYSON IS.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.473
I THINK SHE'S THE ONE
WHO DID IT.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.346
ARE YOU SERIOUS? SHE DOESN'T
EXACTLY LOOK LIKE THE TYPE.

04:35.346 --> 04:38.409
LOOKS ARE ALWAYS DECEIVING
WITH VICTORIA.

04:38.409 --> 04:41.552
SHE DESPISES TREADWELL
AND SHE DESPISES YOU, TOO.

04:41.552 --> 04:45.285
YOU NEED TO LEAVE TOWN,
LAY LOW FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.559
WHAT? WHY?

04:48.559 --> 04:50.321
BECAUSE VICTORIA HATES ME,

04:50.321 --> 04:51.792
AND YOU'RE PRETENDING
TO BE ME.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.293
IF SHE CAN
BURN DOWN A HOUSE,

04:53.293 --> 04:54.795
SHE CAN DEFINITELY
PIN IT ON YOU,

04:54.795 --> 04:56.467
OR WORSE...

04:56.467 --> 04:57.998
SOMEONE
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.000
BABE, WE'VE SURVIVED
A LOT WORSE

05:00.000 --> 05:02.673
THAN MS. MONEYBAGS.

05:02.673 --> 05:05.005
AND I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF...

05:05.005 --> 05:07.037
AND JACK.

05:07.037 --> 05:09.840
(sighs)

05:12.483 --> 05:14.515
(Charlotte and Conrad laugh)

05:14.515 --> 05:16.447
DECLAN.
 LOOK, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

05:16.447 --> 05:18.349
YOU WANT
TO ORDER SOMETHING?

05:18.349 --> 05:20.421
UH, NO. THAT'S OKAY.
I FILLED UP ON BEER NUTS.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.652
(Charlotte laughs)

05:21.652 --> 05:23.494
IT'S THE BREAKFAST
OF CHAMPIONS.
 MM.

05:23.494 --> 05:25.456
DO YOU WANT TO TELL HIM
OR CAN I?

05:25.456 --> 05:27.828
TELL ME WHAT?

05:27.828 --> 05:31.031
CHARLOTTE AND I WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE,

05:31.031 --> 05:32.363
YOUR FUTURE.

05:32.363 --> 05:33.964
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

05:33.964 --> 05:36.036
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT LATELY.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.638
I KNOW YOU LOST
YOUR FATHER

05:37.638 --> 05:39.840
AND THAT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.374
SO HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN CHARLOTTE

05:43.374 --> 05:45.476
AT COLLINS PREP
THIS FALL?

05:45.476 --> 05:48.118
(indistinct conversations)

05:48.118 --> 05:49.920
I'D LOVE TO,

05:49.920 --> 05:52.723
BUT... I DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY

05:52.723 --> 05:54.485
OR THE GRADES.

05:54.485 --> 05:56.487
AND WHAT IF I TOLD YOU,
THE TUITION'S ALREADY PAID FOR?

05:56.487 --> 05:58.529
THE GRADES
ARE UP TO YOU.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.531
YOU'VE MADE THINGS EASIER
FOR MY DAUGHTER LATELY,

06:00.531 --> 06:01.892
AND I JUST WANT TO REPAY YOU

06:01.892 --> 06:03.734
BY MAKING THINGS
A LITTLE EASIER FOR YOU.

06:03.734 --> 06:05.566
AND THAT'S THE DEAL?

06:05.566 --> 06:07.067
THAT IS THE DEAL.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.639
(man) MR. GRAYSON.

06:08.639 --> 06:10.100
THANK YOU.
 YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.972
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PASS THE ENTRANCE EXAM.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.504
THAT'S AMAZING.

06:13.504 --> 06:14.645
THINK YOU CAN PASS?

06:14.645 --> 06:16.046
DO YOU THINK
I CAN PASS?

06:16.046 --> 06:18.579
(laughs)
YOU'RE GONNA.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.652
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, SIR.
THANK YOU.

06:21.652 --> 06:24.084
(Charlotte giggles)
SERIOUSLY.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.757
WE'RE GOING TO SCHOOL
TOGETHER.

06:26.757 --> 06:28.459
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME.

06:28.459 --> 06:30.761
(thunder rumbling)

06:30.761 --> 06:32.723
(Ryan) LET'S GET
RIGHT TO THIS, SHALL WE?

06:32.723 --> 06:34.695
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RATHER
INTERESTING DISCOVERIES

06:34.695 --> 06:37.498
IN OUR RESEARCH
INTO MR. GRAYSON'S FINANCES.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.930
THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN
SOME INTERESTING DISCOVERIES

06:39.930 --> 06:42.903
ABOUT YOUR CLIENT'S
PAST INDISCRETIONS.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.576
ANY INFIDELITIES MY CLIENT
MAY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN,

06:45.576 --> 06:47.808
FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT,
WAS VOIDED

06:47.808 --> 06:49.810
BY YOUR CLIENT'S AFFAIR
WITH MS. DAVIS.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.682
I'M AFRAID WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A MUCH MORE SERIOUS

06:51.682 --> 06:53.844
BREACH OF TRUST HERE, RYAN.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.789
(David) DO YOU KNOW THE NAME
OF MY FAVORITE AUNT,

06:58.789 --> 07:01.552
THE ONE WHO RAISED ME?

07:01.552 --> 07:04.024
WELL, VICTORIA DOES.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.727
ON THE DAY THAT SHE WAS
SUPPOSED TO TESTIFY,

07:06.727 --> 07:08.699
SHE FELL ILL.

07:08.699 --> 07:12.603
WEEKS LATER, SHE GAVE BIRTH
TO A BABY GIRL.

07:12.603 --> 07:14.204
SHE NAMED HER CHARLOTTE,

07:14.204 --> 07:17.568
SAME AS MY AUNT.

07:17.568 --> 07:20.471
I THINK THAT SHE DID IT
TO SEND ME A MESSAGE

07:20.471 --> 07:23.474
THAT THE LITTLE GIRL
SHE WAS RAISING WITH CONRAD

07:23.474 --> 07:25.616
IS MINE.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.081
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

07:31.081 --> 07:32.953
MY DEAR...

07:32.953 --> 07:35.455
THAT'S HARDLY
THE ISSUE.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.088
WE WILL BE ORDERING
A PATERNITY TEST.

07:38.088 --> 07:40.591
AND IF CHARLOTTE
ISN'T MINE,

07:40.591 --> 07:42.593
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
THE ONLY WAY

07:42.593 --> 07:44.595
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP THIS
FROM THE MEDIA

07:44.595 --> 07:46.466
IS TO WALK AWAY
FROM THIS SHAM OF MARRIAGE

07:46.466 --> 07:49.640
WITH WHATEVER I DEIGN
TO GIVE YOU,

07:49.640 --> 07:52.643
WHICH WON'T INCLUDE
THE GRAYSON NAME, BY THE WAY.

07:52.643 --> 07:53.944
WHEN WE'RE DONE
WITH ALL OF THIS,

07:53.944 --> 07:55.606
YOU'RE GONNA BE BACK
TO VICTORIA HARPER,

07:55.606 --> 07:57.608
WHICH IS ONLY FITTING
CONSIDERING YOU'LL ONCE AGAIN

07:57.608 --> 08:00.250
BE THE DESPERATE, PENNILESS
LITTLE BITCH YOU WERE

08:00.250 --> 08:02.783
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.693
♪♪♪

08:19.029 --> 08:20.571
(wind howling)

08:20.571 --> 08:21.702
YOU'VE BREACHED OUR
DISCLOSURE CONTRACT, VICTORIA...

08:21.702 --> 08:23.704
(howling continues)

08:23.704 --> 08:25.706
AND NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.608
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO REPRESENT YOU

08:27.608 --> 08:29.009
WHEN I CAN'T EVEN TRUST YOU?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.011
I TOLD YOU,
I HAD AN AFFAIR.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.013
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
IT WAS WITH DAVID CLARKE

08:33.013 --> 08:36.186
OR THAT CHARLOTTE COULD
POSSIBLY BE HIS DAUGHTER.

08:36.186 --> 08:37.688
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:37.688 --> 08:39.720
WELL,
OUR LATE HEAD OF SECURITY

08:39.720 --> 08:42.953
HAD A NUMBER OF SUBCONTRACTORS
HE HIRED FOR VARIOUS TASKS.

08:42.953 --> 08:44.595
LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA BE
NEEDING ONE OF THEM.

08:44.595 --> 08:45.796
FOR WHAT?

08:45.796 --> 08:47.698
MASON THINKS THAT HIS TAPES
WERE DESTROYED IN A FIRE,

08:47.698 --> 08:49.960
BUT I KNOW DAMN WELL
IT WAS DELIBERATELY SET

08:49.960 --> 08:51.962
IN ORDER TO COVER THE THEFT.
 BY WHOM?

08:51.962 --> 08:53.133
(keypad beeps)

08:53.133 --> 08:54.304
(auto dials)

08:54.304 --> 08:55.706
(phone rings, line clicks)
 ASHLEY.

08:55.706 --> 08:59.570
PLEASE INVITE AMANDA CLARKE UP
THIS AFTERNOON FOR TEA.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.772
DO NOT TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

09:01.772 --> 09:03.974
(rainfall)

09:03.974 --> 09:05.976
CHARLOTTE?

09:05.976 --> 09:09.780
(rainfall continues)

09:29.770 --> 09:32.773
(thunder rumbling)

09:50.120 --> 09:53.293
(tapes clatter)

10:10.280 --> 10:12.883
EMILY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

10:12.883 --> 10:16.887
JACK, I--I'M SO SORRY.
I... WAS LOOKING FOR AMANDA.

10:16.887 --> 10:19.319
OKAY.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.292
SHE WAS, UH, SHE WAS SUMMONED
TO THE GRAYSON MANOR

10:22.292 --> 10:23.894
FOR TEA WITH VICTORIA.

10:23.894 --> 10:26.326
REALLY? WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.328
WELL, GIVEN HOW MUCH
THE GRAYSONS HATED HER DAD,

10:28.328 --> 10:29.860
I'D SAY NOTHING GOOD.

10:29.860 --> 10:33.303
AFTER WHAT THAT GIRL'S
BEEN THROUGH...

10:33.303 --> 10:35.305
(rainfall continues)

10:35.305 --> 10:38.068
YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT HER,
DON'T YOU?

10:40.010 --> 10:41.942
YEAH.

10:43.774 --> 10:46.376
THANK YOU, BY THE WAY,
FOR BEING SO NICE TO HER.

10:46.376 --> 10:49.349
IT MEANS A LOT.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.921
I'LL, UH,

10:50.921 --> 10:52.723
I'LL TELL HER
YOU STOPPED BY.

10:52.723 --> 10:54.324
HEY, JACK.

10:54.324 --> 10:56.386
(rainfall continues)

10:56.386 --> 10:57.888
BE CAREFUL.

11:00.130 --> 11:01.291
(thunder rumbling)

11:01.291 --> 11:03.794
UH, THE STORM'S
COMING IN QUICKLY.

11:03.794 --> 11:06.797
(rainfall continues)

11:10.941 --> 11:12.703
(door opens)

11:12.703 --> 11:14.845
(door closes)

11:14.845 --> 11:17.908
(thunder rumbling)

11:17.908 --> 11:20.911
(rainfall)

11:20.911 --> 11:24.755
(clock ticking)

11:24.755 --> 11:26.056
THE STRAWBERRIES WERE PICKED

11:26.056 --> 11:28.118
FRESH FROM MY GARDEN
THIS MORNING.

11:28.118 --> 11:30.891
MM. DELICIOUS.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.423
SO YOU'RE
NO LONGER ALLERGIC?

11:33.423 --> 11:36.026
I REMEMBER A COMPANY PICNIC
WHERE ONE BITE SENT YOU

11:36.026 --> 11:38.098
STRAIGHT TO
THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.931
YOUR FATHER
WAS BESIDE HIMSELF.

11:40.931 --> 11:42.332
(chuckles)

11:42.332 --> 11:44.805
FORTUNATELY,
I OUTGREW THAT.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.106
WELL, THEN BY ALL MEANS,

11:46.106 --> 11:48.278
HAVE SOME CREME FRAICHE
WITH IT.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.923
(lightning cracks)

12:02.923 --> 12:05.025
I LOVE SUMMER STORMS.
DON'T YOU?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.496
NOT REALLY.

12:07.958 --> 12:11.261
LET ME BE DIRECT.

12:11.261 --> 12:12.963
MASON TELLS ME, YOU CLAIM

12:12.963 --> 12:15.906
I HAD A RELATIONSHIP
WITH DAVID CLARKE.

12:15.906 --> 12:17.808
YOU DON'T HONESTLY
BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU?

12:17.808 --> 12:19.409
I REMEMBER WHAT I REMEMBER.

12:19.409 --> 12:20.410
WHICH IS?

12:20.410 --> 12:22.042
SAME AS YOU,
MOST LIKELY.

12:28.879 --> 12:32.152
WELL, I HAVE TO CONFESS
THAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

12:32.152 --> 12:34.424
MY MEMORY IS JUST A LITTLE BIT
FOGGY OF THOSE TIMES.

12:34.424 --> 12:37.287
YOU REMEMBERED MY
STRAWBERRY ALLERGY JUST FINE.

12:37.287 --> 12:40.130
ACTUALLY,
WHEN I COME TO THINK OF IT,

12:40.130 --> 12:43.763
I'M NOT ALL THAT CERTAIN
THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS YOU.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.465
ALL RIGHT.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.467
WHY DON'T YOU CUT THE CRAP

12:47.467 --> 12:49.800
AND TELL ME
WHAT I'M REALLY DOING HERE?

12:49.800 --> 12:50.941
MASON BELIEVES

12:50.941 --> 12:53.303
THAT YOU HAVE SOME SORT
OF VENDETTA AGAINST US.

12:53.303 --> 12:55.275
AND THIS DOVETAILS
VERY NICELY

12:55.275 --> 12:57.077
WITH THIS UNCANNY SENSE
I HAVE

12:57.077 --> 12:59.509
THAT HIS HOUSE DIDN'T
JUST BURN DOWN ACCIDENTALLY.

12:59.509 --> 13:01.211
WORD ON THE STREET IS,
YOU LIT THAT MATCH

13:01.211 --> 13:02.913
SO YOU COULD PIN IT ON ME.

13:02.913 --> 13:04.054
IS THAT SO?

13:04.054 --> 13:05.355
MM-HMM.

13:05.355 --> 13:06.516
WELL, THEN MAYBE
YOU SHOULD TELL ME

13:06.516 --> 13:07.988
WHY YOU SENT THAT TAPE
TO MY HUSBAND.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.960
(rainfall continues)

13:09.960 --> 13:11.892
HUH.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.163
IS IT MONEY YOU'RE AFTER?

13:13.163 --> 13:16.166
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

13:16.166 --> 13:19.099
AND APPARENTLY,
NEITHER DO YOU.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.071
SIT DOWN.

13:21.071 --> 13:24.804
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS
FROM YOU.

13:27.537 --> 13:28.909
(door opens)

13:28.909 --> 13:30.280
RYAN.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.082
OKAY. I'M HERE RIGHT NOW.
 (door closes)

13:32.082 --> 13:33.043
YEAH.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.345
(cell phone beeps)

13:35.345 --> 13:37.948
THE SPOON.

13:37.948 --> 13:40.190
I'LL HAVE THE LAB
RUSH THIS RIGHT THROUGH.

13:40.190 --> 13:42.923
THERE'S NO WAY THAT GIRL
IS DAVID CLARKE'S DAUGHTER.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.295
WELL, WE'LL KNOW
SOON ENOUGH.

13:45.295 --> 13:48.358
VICTORIA, I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH CONRAD'S LAWYER.

13:48.358 --> 13:51.531
THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM
CHARLOTTE'S D.N.A. TEST ARE IN.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.234
HE'S NOT THE FATHER.

14:13.023 --> 14:14.184
(knock on door)

14:14.184 --> 14:15.385
KNOCK, KNOCK.

14:15.385 --> 14:17.457
HEY.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.459
YOUR MOM WANTED ME TO LET YOU
KNOW THAT YOUR DAD'S

14:19.459 --> 14:21.191
ON HIS WAY OVER
WITH HIS LAWYER

14:21.191 --> 14:23.193
IN CASE YOU WANTED
TO RUN FOR THE HILLS.

14:23.193 --> 14:25.635
OKAY, JUST, UH, JUST LET HER
KNOW I WON'T BE HERE.

14:27.037 --> 14:28.969
ARE YOU PROPOSING
TO EMILY?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.401
(sighs) DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO MY MOTHER, ALL RIGHT?

14:31.401 --> 14:34.544
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW
UNTIL EMILY SAYS YES.

14:35.906 --> 14:37.407
YOU THINK SHE WILL?

14:37.407 --> 14:40.180
WELL, AFTER YOUR
LENGTHY COURTSHIP, WHO WOULDN'T?

14:40.180 --> 14:43.013
WOW. YOU SOUND ABOUT
AS HAPPY AS MY MOM DOES.

14:43.013 --> 14:45.385
WHAT HAPPENED TO BEING
EMILY'S BEST FRIEND?

14:45.385 --> 14:48.588
DANIEL...

14:48.588 --> 14:52.092
YOU PICKED
A REALLY LOVELY RING.

14:55.225 --> 14:56.396
(door closes)

14:56.396 --> 14:59.029
DESPITE THE D.N.A. RESULTS,
MR. GRAYSON

14:59.029 --> 15:02.272
HAS NO INTENTION OF VOIDING
CHARLOTTE'S TRUST FUND.

15:02.272 --> 15:04.975
HOW VERY GENEROUS
OF YOU.

15:04.975 --> 15:06.376
SHE'S NOT TO BLAME,
AFTER ALL.

15:06.376 --> 15:08.108
SHE DOES REALIZE
THAT MEANS WE'RE DONE

15:08.108 --> 15:09.279
WITH THE IDEA
OF MEDIATION?

15:09.279 --> 15:11.011
YOU REALLY WANT
A PROTRACTED TRIAL?

15:11.011 --> 15:13.143
YOU KNOW YOU'LL BOTH
BE SKEWERED IN THE MEDIA.

15:13.143 --> 15:16.116
NO, SOMEHOW I THINK IT'S
MY SOON-TO-BE EX-WIFE

15:16.116 --> 15:18.418
WHO'S GONNA DRAW
THE MOST UNFLATTERING SPOTLIGHT.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.250
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH HER
IN PRIVATE.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.421
(Barbara) THAT MIGHT NOT BE
THE BEST IDEA.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.993
NO, I WOULD ADVISE
AGAINST THAT.

15:22.993 --> 15:24.294
IT'S NOT A REQUEST.

15:24.294 --> 15:27.657
(Victoria) MUST YOU DRAG
CHARLOTTE INTO ALL THIS?

15:27.657 --> 15:29.199
ME?

15:29.199 --> 15:32.002
THAT'S RICH.

15:32.002 --> 15:34.634
HERE ARE YOUR OPTIONS,
AND THEY ARE LIMITED--

15:34.634 --> 15:37.037
"A," YOU ACCEPT THE PITTANCE
I'M PREPARED TO OFFER YOU

15:37.037 --> 15:39.039
IN EXCHANGE FOR AVOIDING
A TRIAL

15:39.039 --> 15:41.041
OR "B,"
WE TAKE THIS TO COURT,

15:41.041 --> 15:43.373
AND IT BECOMES COMMON KNOWLEDGE
THAT CHARLOTTE

15:43.373 --> 15:46.216
IS THE DAUGHTER
OF THE MOST HATED IN AMERICA,

15:46.216 --> 15:49.219
MEANING YOU HAD
A TORRID LOVE AFFAIR

15:49.219 --> 15:50.620
WITH A TERRORIST.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.122
DAVID CLARKE WAS NO TERRORIST,

15:52.122 --> 15:54.184
AND HE WAS TWICE THE MAN
YOU EVER WERE.

15:54.184 --> 15:56.026
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A VERY HARD TIME

15:56.026 --> 15:57.687
CONVINCING THE REST
OF THE WORLD OF THAT.

15:57.687 --> 16:02.432
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE,
VICTORIA, "A" OR "B"?

16:02.432 --> 16:04.734
I DID EVERYTHING
YOU ASKED FOR,

16:04.734 --> 16:07.667
AND NOW YOU'RE PREPARED TO THROW
YOUR CHILDREN TO THE WOLVES

16:07.667 --> 16:09.169
AND LEAVE ME WITH NOTHING

16:09.169 --> 16:11.171
ALL BECAUSE OF
YOUR WOUNDED PRIDE?

16:12.302 --> 16:14.304
I'LL INSTRUCT BARBARA
TO SEND OVER

16:14.304 --> 16:16.076
MY FINAL PROPOSAL.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.148
REJECT IT, AND WHATEVER
HAPPENS TO CHARLOTTE

16:18.148 --> 16:20.050
WILL BE ON YOUR HANDS.

16:22.552 --> 16:25.085
(gasps)

16:28.118 --> 16:30.320
BLOODY HELL.

16:34.764 --> 16:36.166
(indistinct conversations)

16:36.166 --> 16:38.328
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO BE
LIGHTING ALL THE CANDLES.

16:38.328 --> 16:40.430
WHAT, YOU'RE AFRAID I'M GONNA
BURN THE PLACE DOWN?

16:40.430 --> 16:42.772
OKAY, OKAY. LOOK...

16:42.772 --> 16:44.304
YOU'VE BEEN LIKE THIS

16:44.304 --> 16:45.635
EVER SINCE YOUR TEA
WITH VICTORIA.

16:45.635 --> 16:48.338
YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:48.338 --> 16:50.310
THE BITCH
PRACTICALLY ACCUSED ME

16:50.310 --> 16:52.082
OF BURNING DOWN
TREADWELL'S HOUSE.

16:52.082 --> 16:54.144
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
 SHE WHAT? THAT'S INSANE.

16:54.144 --> 16:55.745
YEAH,
WHAT'S EVEN MORE INSANE

16:55.745 --> 16:59.089
IS THAT EMILY TRIED
TO WARN ME SHE'D DO IT.

16:59.089 --> 17:00.590
(sighs) I SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO HER FROM THE BEGINNING.

17:00.590 --> 17:02.052
BEGINNING OF WHAT?

17:02.052 --> 17:03.253
(shatters)

17:03.253 --> 17:04.594
(man) OH, GREAT JOB BUDDY.

17:04.594 --> 17:06.396
(Nolan) CRAP. SORRY.

17:06.396 --> 17:08.258
DO YOU HAVE A BROOM
OR ANYTHING?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.432
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.134
OKAY.

17:16.106 --> 17:17.467
HEY...

17:17.467 --> 17:19.539
CHATTY CATHY.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.173
ZIP IT.

17:23.173 --> 17:25.044
JACK CAN'T KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING
THAT EMILY'S TOLD YOU.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.546
SHE'S BARELY
TOLD ME ANYTHING.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.278
I'M PRACTICALLY
AS IN THE DARK AS JACK IS.

17:28.278 --> 17:31.081
WELL, LISTEN, EMILY'S BEEN
NOTHING BUT GOOD TO YOU.

17:31.081 --> 17:33.183
REALLY? A FEW DAYS AGO,
EMILY EARWIGS ME INTO

17:33.183 --> 17:34.524
GETTING ALL UP
IN MASON'S GRILL,

17:34.524 --> 17:37.187
AND THEN COINCIDENTALLY,
HIS HOUSE BURNS TO THE GROUND?

17:37.187 --> 17:39.789
GREAT QUESTIONS...
FOR EMILY.

17:39.789 --> 17:41.761
SO TILL YOU GET SOME ANSWERS,

17:41.761 --> 17:43.293
KEEP JACK OUT OF IT.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.798
(Charlotte) HEY, DADDY.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.673
DECLAN'S SO BLOWN AWAY
BY YOUR OFFER

17:53.673 --> 17:55.775
THAT WE'VE SPENT
THE ENTIRE DAY

17:55.775 --> 17:58.178
PREPPING FOR THE EXAMS.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.081
OH, NO.
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:03.853 --> 18:08.118
UH, WELL, CHARLOTTE,
WE NEED TO TALK.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.561
WHAT'D SHE DO THIS TIME?

18:11.561 --> 18:14.824
OH, NO.
IT'S JUST, UM...

18:16.196 --> 18:18.198
I'M GOING TO BE MAKING
SOME CHANGES

18:18.198 --> 18:20.530
OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

18:20.530 --> 18:21.871
IT'S THE END OF THE SUMMER,

18:21.871 --> 18:23.403
AND THINGS ARE HEATING UP
FOR ME AT THE OFFICE

18:23.403 --> 18:26.706
SO I'M GONNA BE GOING
BACK AND FORTH TO THE CITY MORE

18:26.706 --> 18:28.838
AND MORE.

18:28.838 --> 18:31.241
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:31.241 --> 18:32.542
I'M SAYING,

18:32.542 --> 18:35.185
IT'S NOT PRACTICAL
FOR YOU TO STAY WITH ME.

18:35.185 --> 18:37.847
BUT I'M SUPPOSED
TO LIVE WITH YOU.

18:37.847 --> 18:39.849
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BUYING
ANOTHER HOUSE HERE.

18:39.849 --> 18:41.851
OH, I KNOW THAT WAS THE PLAN,
BUT I THINK IT'S BEST

18:41.851 --> 18:44.123
IF YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR MOTHER'S.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.596
I CAN'T STAND HER, DADDY.
YOU KNOW THAT.

18:46.596 --> 18:47.897
THEN YOU NEED
TO WORK ON THAT.

18:47.897 --> 18:50.160
YOU'RE NOT A CHILD
ANYMORE, CHARLOTTE.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.832
IT'S TIME YOU START
GROWING UP.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.704
(sighs)

18:56.666 --> 18:58.868
(door closes)

19:05.515 --> 19:06.676
(thunder rumbling)

19:06.676 --> 19:08.518
(Daniel) OKAY,
JUST A LITTLE FURTHER.

19:09.719 --> 19:12.722
(string quartet playing
romantic music)

19:12.722 --> 19:15.585
YOU RECOGNIZE
WHERE WE ARE?

19:15.585 --> 19:18.428
IT'S WHERE I SPILLED
MY DRINK ON YOUR JACKET.

19:18.428 --> 19:20.660
YOU REALLY KEPT IT.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.763
(sighs)
MAN OF MY WORD.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.265
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR GOOD FIRST IMPRESSIONS.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.936
THAT WAS
A PERFECT IMPRESSION,

19:26.936 --> 19:28.438
AS WAS YOUR SECOND
AND YOUR THIRD.

19:28.438 --> 19:30.300
YOU KNOW,
MOST MEN IN THIS TOWN

19:30.300 --> 19:32.702
WOULD'VE THROWN ME
OFF THE BOAT.

19:32.702 --> 19:35.805
(sighs) YOU WERE...
SO SWEET ABOUT IT.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.277
(chuckles)

19:37.277 --> 19:39.379
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE
LOOK AT ME

19:39.379 --> 19:41.751
AND SEE ME
FOR SOMEONE I'M NOT.

19:41.751 --> 19:44.314
AND I SPENT THE FIRST PART
OF MY LIFE

19:44.314 --> 19:47.387
EITHER DISAPPOINTING THEM
OR WORSE...

19:47.387 --> 19:49.559
(chuckles) LIVING UP
TO THEIR EXPECTATIONS.
 (chuckles)

19:49.559 --> 19:51.261
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON

19:51.261 --> 19:54.364
THAT I COULD BE
MY TRUE SELF AROUND.

19:54.364 --> 19:55.695
(music continues)

19:55.695 --> 19:57.196
LUCKY ME.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.699
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR VERY LONG,

19:59.699 --> 20:02.902
AND WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH
SOME PRETTY UNEXPECTED THINGS

20:02.902 --> 20:05.204
IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.736
(thunder rumbling)

20:06.736 --> 20:08.878
SORT OF LIKE THIS WEATHER.

20:08.878 --> 20:10.209
YOU THINK ONE STORM'S PASSED,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.841
AND ANOTHER ONE'S
ON THE HORIZON...

20:11.841 --> 20:12.912
(music stops)

20:12.912 --> 20:14.244
(raindrops plunking)

20:14.244 --> 20:16.246
WHICH IS

20:16.246 --> 20:19.319
WHY I'M SURE ABOUT
THE WAY I FEEL FOR YOU,

20:19.319 --> 20:20.850
'CAUSE AS LONG
AS I HAVE YOU...

20:20.850 --> 20:22.221
(chuckles)

20:22.221 --> 20:22.992
I'M NOT STOPPING.

20:22.992 --> 20:25.295
GOOD. (laughs)

20:25.295 --> 20:27.427
(lightning cracks)

20:27.427 --> 20:29.359
(thunder rumbling)

20:29.359 --> 20:31.861
(laughs)

20:31.861 --> 20:33.002
(exhales)

20:33.002 --> 20:35.865
NO ONE'S EVER MADE ME FEEL
AS LOVED

20:35.865 --> 20:38.538
AND AS SAFE AND UNDERSTOOD
AS YOU DO.

20:38.538 --> 20:41.271
IF YOU LET ME...

20:41.271 --> 20:43.273
I'D LIKE TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

20:43.273 --> 20:45.014
MAKING YOU AS HAPPY
AS YOU'VE MADE ME.

20:58.588 --> 21:01.291
EMILY THORNE,

21:01.291 --> 21:02.762
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

21:02.762 --> 21:06.336
(panting)

21:06.336 --> 21:08.267
(exhales deeply) YES.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.371
(laughs)

21:41.371 --> 21:43.433
(laughs)

21:53.643 --> 21:54.884
(both laughing)

21:54.884 --> 21:56.586
IF ONLY I COULD'VE
CONTROLLED THE WEATHER.

21:56.586 --> 21:59.489
(laughs)
PERFECTLY ROMANTIC.

21:59.489 --> 22:02.352
ROMANCE IS NEVER PERFECT.

22:02.352 --> 22:05.395
BUT DON'T LET ME RAIN
ON ANYONE'S PARADE.

22:05.395 --> 22:07.727
MOM, HI. SORRY.
WE WERE JUST...

22:07.727 --> 22:08.858
(chuckles)

22:08.858 --> 22:11.401
IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT YOU
WERE DOING, SWEETHEART.

22:11.401 --> 22:12.562
HELLO, EMILY.

22:12.562 --> 22:13.933
VICTORIA.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.706
OH, YOU TWO
LOOK LIKE COCONSPIRATORS.

22:16.706 --> 22:18.638
(chuckles)

22:18.638 --> 22:19.939
DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE...

22:23.673 --> 22:26.476
YET, I SEE THAT YOU HAVE.

22:26.476 --> 22:28.778
MOM, WE WERE JUST COMING
TO GIVE YOU SOME GOOD NEWS.

22:28.778 --> 22:30.380
OH, AND WHAT NEWS
IS THAT?

22:30.380 --> 22:31.681
VICTORIA, UM...
 MOM...

22:31.681 --> 22:33.383
DID YOU TELL YOUR FATHER?

22:33.383 --> 22:35.655
I'M SURE HE WILL BE THRILLED.

22:35.655 --> 22:36.686
NO, YOU'RE THE FIRST,

22:36.686 --> 22:38.858
THEN CHARLOTTE, THEN DAD.

22:39.889 --> 22:41.861
OH, COME ON, MOM.
BE HAPPY FOR US.

22:52.502 --> 22:54.604
CONGRATULATIONS.

22:56.776 --> 23:00.750
(footsteps recede)

23:02.412 --> 23:03.883
ASHLEY DAVENPORT...

23:03.883 --> 23:05.455
SLUMMING IT.

23:05.455 --> 23:06.886
(Nolan) MM.
 VODKA SODA, PLEASE.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.057
HOUSE IS FINE.

23:08.057 --> 23:09.419
YOU GOT IT.

23:09.419 --> 23:11.861
HOUSE VODKA?
ASH, TALK TO ME.

23:11.861 --> 23:13.563
WELL,
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

23:13.563 --> 23:16.496
I'VE BASICALLY SHUNNED
MY BEST FRIEND ALL SUMMER

23:16.496 --> 23:18.468
IN FAVOR OF
WORMING MY WAY ABOARD

23:18.468 --> 23:19.969
THE "S.S. QUEEN VICTORIA"

23:19.969 --> 23:22.772
ONLY TO FIND OUT
THAT IT'S A SINKING SHIP.

23:22.772 --> 23:25.004
HOW SO?

23:25.004 --> 23:27.707
ALL I'VE GOT TO SHOW FOR
MY SUMMER WITH THE GRAYSONS

23:27.707 --> 23:30.079
IS A GUN-WIELDING PSYCHOTIC
EX-BOYFRIEND

23:30.079 --> 23:32.782
WHO MADE OUT WITH YOU.

23:34.183 --> 23:36.115
MEANWHILE, EMILY GETS
AN ENGAGEMENT RING

23:36.115 --> 23:38.187
AND THE KEYS
TO THE KINGDOM.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.753
WAIT. EMILY...
SAID YES?

23:43.753 --> 23:46.496
ACCORDING TO HER TEXT.

23:46.496 --> 23:49.629
I'M GONNA GO TO THE LOO
AND DROWN MYSELF IN IT.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.901
IT'S BACK THERE.

23:53.102 --> 23:55.605
DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT?

23:55.605 --> 23:57.907
I'M AFRAID YOU DID.

24:00.910 --> 24:02.872
(indistinct conversations)

24:02.872 --> 24:04.574
YOU WANNA POUR ANOTHER ONE
FOR YOURSELF,

24:04.574 --> 24:05.745
MY TREAT?

24:05.745 --> 24:07.817
(chuckles)
I'M ON THE CLOCK.

24:07.817 --> 24:09.849
WHAT TIME YOU DONE?

24:09.849 --> 24:11.651
MAYBE I CAN GIVE YOU
A RIDE HOME.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.782
I AM HOME.

24:12.782 --> 24:14.223
I LIVE UPSTAIRS.

24:14.223 --> 24:15.785
EVEN MORE CONVENIENT.

24:15.785 --> 24:17.086
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

24:17.086 --> 24:19.659
YOU ENJOY YOUR DRINK.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.591
(indistinct conversations
continue)

24:21.591 --> 24:22.932
HELLO, DAD.

24:22.932 --> 24:25.464
(people speaking indistinctly)

24:25.464 --> 24:26.796
WHERE'S CHARLOTTE?

24:26.796 --> 24:28.137
SHE WASN'T IN HER ROOM.

24:28.137 --> 24:29.669
I SENT HER HOME.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.970
HOME? WHY?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.943
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHERE SHE BELONGS.

24:33.943 --> 24:35.945
WHY DO YOU NEED HER?

24:35.945 --> 24:38.948
I'VE ASKED EMILY
TO MARRY ME.

24:38.948 --> 24:40.249
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

24:40.249 --> 24:41.781
SHE SAID YES.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.853
I SEE.

24:43.853 --> 24:46.916
AND IS MS. THORNE
AT ALL AWARE

24:46.916 --> 24:48.788
THAT SHE'S JUST PART
OF A SCHEME FOR YOU

24:48.788 --> 24:50.690
TO GET YOUR HANDS
ON YOUR SHARE OF THE COMPANY?

24:50.690 --> 24:51.891
SEE, I'M NOT HALF THE FOOL

24:51.891 --> 24:54.564
YOUR MOTHER HAS CLEARLY
PAINTED ME OUT TO BE.

24:54.564 --> 24:55.865
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK,
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE BITTER

24:55.865 --> 24:57.196
OVER EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND MOM.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.868
BITTER DOESN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO COVER IT.

24:58.868 --> 25:01.500
BUT ASSUMING YOU WERE
EVER IN LOVE,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.002
THERE HAS TO BE A PART OF YOU
THAT STILL REMEMBERS

25:03.002 --> 25:05.204
HOW YOU FELT
WHEN YOU FIRST MET HER.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.136
THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT EMILY.

25:07.136 --> 25:08.978
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

25:08.978 --> 25:11.210
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:11.210 --> 25:14.984
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER,
DANIEL,

25:14.984 --> 25:17.617
AND I FELL HARD.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.518
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

25:19.518 --> 25:21.290
MY FIRST MARRIAGE
WAS ALREADY A DISASTER

25:21.290 --> 25:23.593
WHEN I WALKED INTO THAT LITTLE
ART GALLERY IN THE VILLAGE

25:23.593 --> 25:25.695
AND I SAW YOUR MOTHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

25:25.695 --> 25:27.827
AND, YEAH, I'M SURE
I FELT ABOUT HER THEN

25:27.827 --> 25:29.859
THE SAME WAY YOU THINK
YOU FEEL ABOUT EMILY NOW.

25:29.859 --> 25:31.861
EXCEPT I'D NEVER TREAT EMILY
THE WAY YOU'RE TREATING MOM.

25:31.861 --> 25:33.232
NO, NO, NO, YOU SAY THAT,

25:33.232 --> 25:34.764
BUT YOU'LL BE AT EACH OTHER'S
THROAT IN THE END.

25:34.764 --> 25:35.905
YOU'LL SEE.

25:35.905 --> 25:37.236
YOU'LL CHEAT ON HER,
SHE'LL CHEAT ON YOU,

25:37.236 --> 25:38.768
AND THEN ONE DAY,
YOU'LL FIND OUT

25:38.768 --> 25:39.909
SHE'S BEEN KEEPING
A SECRET SO BIG,

25:39.909 --> 25:43.042
IT'LL DESTROY
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.574
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

25:44.574 --> 25:46.245
WHAT SECRET?

25:46.245 --> 25:48.247
WH-WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:48.247 --> 25:50.179
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
SO COZY WITH YOUR MOMMY,

25:50.179 --> 25:53.082
WHY DON'T YOU LET HER
TELL YOU?

26:03.993 --> 26:05.995
(knock on door)

26:07.566 --> 26:08.938
CHARLOTTE.

26:08.938 --> 26:11.841
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
I WAS LOOKING FOR DANIEL.

26:11.841 --> 26:12.972
AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

26:12.972 --> 26:16.145
HE WENT
TO THE SOUTHFORK INN.

26:16.145 --> 26:18.077
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

26:19.949 --> 26:22.581
(voice breaking)
MY DAD JUST KICKED ME OUT.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.754
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I DID.

26:24.754 --> 26:27.316
EVERYTHING WAS FINE, HE OFFERED
TO PAY FOR DECLAN'S SCHOOL,

26:27.316 --> 26:30.660
AND THEN
JUST OUT OF THE BLUE...

26:31.961 --> 26:35.995
I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN HIM
LOOK AT ME THAT WAY BEFORE.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.727
WHAT WAY?

26:37.727 --> 26:39.929
THE WAY HE LOOKS AT MY MOM.

26:41.330 --> 26:45.735
(sighs deeply)

26:45.735 --> 26:47.006
OH, MY GOD.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.978
EMILY...

26:50.910 --> 26:53.943
DID DANIEL PROPOSE?

26:53.943 --> 26:57.216
YEAH. HE WANTED
TO TELL YOU HIMSELF.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.819
IS THAT OKAY?

26:59.819 --> 27:04.023
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BADLY
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A SISTER.

27:11.931 --> 27:15.004
(Victoria) AT THIS LATE AN HOUR,
YOU MUST BE BEARING BAD NEWS.

27:15.004 --> 27:16.305
THAT DEPENDS.

27:16.305 --> 27:19.008
THE LAB COMPARED
AMANDA'S D.N.A. SAMPLES

27:19.008 --> 27:20.139
TO CHARLOTTE'S.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.871
AND?

27:21.871 --> 27:23.042
THEY'RE A MATCH.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.974
THEY'RE DEFINITELY
HALF SISTERS.

27:24.974 --> 27:26.976
THAT MEANS SHE REALLY IS
AMANDA CLARKE.

27:26.976 --> 27:28.848
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.149
THERE IS
SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS

27:30.149 --> 27:32.151
I NEED TO DISCUSS WITH YOU,
VICTORIA,

27:32.151 --> 27:35.785
ABOUT MY SERVICES
AND YOUR LEGAL AFFAIRS.

27:35.785 --> 27:38.988
ALLOW ME TO HELP YOU,
MR. HUNTLEY.

27:38.988 --> 27:40.930
YOU'RE FIRED.

27:52.902 --> 27:54.443
(tapes clattering)

27:54.443 --> 27:57.046
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

27:57.046 --> 27:58.677
(clattering continues)

27:58.677 --> 28:00.109
YOU DON'T WANT
TO MESS WITH ME, BRO.

28:00.109 --> 28:02.912
I WAS JUST LEAVING.
 NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING--

28:02.912 --> 28:04.914
(glass clatters)

28:04.914 --> 28:06.455
(grunting)

28:06.455 --> 28:07.987
(grunts)

28:07.987 --> 28:10.820
(both grunting)

28:10.820 --> 28:13.362
(pants)

28:13.362 --> 28:15.394
(grunts) AAH!

28:15.394 --> 28:17.727
(groans) OHH!

28:17.727 --> 28:19.468
(thumping)

28:19.468 --> 28:21.170
(grunts and coughs)

28:21.170 --> 28:24.133
YOU SHOULDA LISTENED.

28:24.133 --> 28:26.876
(Amanda) JACK,
ARE YOU UP THERE?

28:26.876 --> 28:29.108
JACK, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

28:29.108 --> 28:31.140
OH, MY GOD.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.182
JACK. JACK. OH, NO. NO.

28:39.789 --> 28:41.250
WHAT HAPPENED?

28:41.250 --> 28:43.993
JACK GOT THE CRAP
BEAT OUT OF HIM.

28:43.993 --> 28:46.796
HE STUMBLED UPON SOME GUY
RIFLING THROUGH AMANDA'S STUFF

28:46.796 --> 28:48.357
LOOKING FOR, PRESUMABLY,

28:48.357 --> 28:50.830
A SET OF Hi8 VIDEOTAPES.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.501
VICTORIA DID THIS.

28:52.501 --> 28:54.203
NO.

28:54.203 --> 28:56.505
YOU DID THIS WHEN YOU
PLANTED TREADWELL'S TAPES.

28:56.505 --> 28:59.738
I NEVER MEANT
FOR JACK TO GET HURT.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.942
HOW MUCH COLLATERAL DAMAGE
ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT?

29:02.942 --> 29:06.415
I MAY HAVE JACK'S BLOOD
ALL OVER MY JACKET,

29:06.415 --> 29:08.417
BUT YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL OVER YOUR HANDS.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.382
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO.

29:13.382 --> 29:15.825
YEAH.

29:15.825 --> 29:18.757
(chuckles)
DON'T YOU ALWAYS?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.791
(sighs) NICE RING.

29:26.435 --> 29:29.098
I TOLD YOU JACK PORTER
WAS OFF-LIMITS.

29:29.098 --> 29:30.539
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:30.539 --> 29:32.241
VICTORIA CALLED IN
HER OWN GUY.

29:32.241 --> 29:33.973
THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD DO.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.775
YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO CONTROL IT.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.377
THEY GOT TO YOU,
DIDN'T THEY?

29:38.377 --> 29:39.979
NO.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.780
YOUR FATHER DID.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.512
I TOLD HIM HIS BEST SHOT
AT A NEW TRIAL

29:43.512 --> 29:45.284
WOULD MEAN PULLING YOU IN.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.785
HE REFUSED.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.087
HE WAS AFRAID OF
WHAT THE CONSPIRACY MIGHT DO

29:48.087 --> 29:50.119
TO KEEP YOU SILENCED.

29:50.119 --> 29:52.091
YOU'RE LUCKY I INTERCEPTED

29:52.091 --> 29:54.093
THAT D.N.A. TEST
SHE ORDERED ON AMANDA.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.265
IF I HADN'T SWITCHED
THE SAMPLE, YOU'D BE FINISHED.

29:56.265 --> 29:58.527
I KNOW.

29:58.527 --> 30:00.499
THANK YOU.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.232
YOU KNOW I BELIEVE
YOUR FATHER IS INNOCENT,

30:03.232 --> 30:05.534
BUT I CAN'T BE PART
OF THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE.

30:05.534 --> 30:08.407
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU REASSESS
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

30:39.869 --> 30:42.611
(sniffles)

30:42.611 --> 30:45.244
(whispers)
I'M SO SORRY, JACK.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.131
WE NEED TO TALK.

31:02.131 --> 31:04.433
(sighs) NO KIDDING.

31:04.433 --> 31:06.535
I'VE GOT ABOUT A GAJILLION
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

31:06.535 --> 31:08.998
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
KEEPING SECRETS FROM ME.

31:08.998 --> 31:11.540
YOU HAVE ABOUT FIVE SECONDS
TO START TALKING.

31:17.907 --> 31:20.579
THE GRAYSONS
FRAMED MY FATHER.

31:23.412 --> 31:27.116
THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT PLANE GOING DOWN.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.960
THEY SET HIM UP
TO TAKE THE FALL.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.891
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.563
(chuckles)

31:34.563 --> 31:36.926
WHILE I WAS ROTTING AWAY
IN JUVIE WITH YOU

31:36.926 --> 31:39.098
AND MY FATHER WAS ROTTING AWAY
IN FEDERAL PRISON,

31:39.098 --> 31:42.932
THE GRAYSONS WERE SITTING
IN THAT HOUSE...

31:42.932 --> 31:47.176
LIVING THEIR LIVES,
SPENDING THEIR MONEY...

31:47.176 --> 31:49.939
RAISING THEIR KIDS...

31:51.410 --> 31:53.612
LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.385
SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

31:56.385 --> 32:00.619
I CAME BACK TO AVENGE
MY FATHER'S DEATH...

32:01.991 --> 32:04.693
AND TO TAKE EVERYTHING
AWAY FROM THEM.

32:06.455 --> 32:09.258
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

32:09.258 --> 32:11.360
I-IF YOU
WOULDA TOLD ME, I--

32:11.360 --> 32:14.463
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.

32:14.463 --> 32:17.666
THE GRAYSONS HIRED THAT GUY
WHO BEAT UP JACK.

32:17.666 --> 32:19.468
AND NOW YOU'RE BOTH
IN DANGER.

32:19.468 --> 32:21.040
THEY DID THIS TO HIM?

32:22.641 --> 32:25.644
YOU NEED TO GO
TO SAVE YOURSELF...

32:27.246 --> 32:29.418
AND JACK...

32:33.422 --> 32:36.285
AND IF YOU CARE TO...

32:37.987 --> 32:39.958
(voice breaks) ME.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.232
YOU KNOW I'D DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

32:43.232 --> 32:44.963
(sniffles)

32:48.998 --> 32:51.640
THIS IS
YOUR NEW CELL PHONE.

32:53.442 --> 32:55.644
I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR OLD ONE.

32:55.644 --> 32:59.548
YOUR FAKE I.D. AND PASSPORT
ARE IN YOUR BAG.

32:59.548 --> 33:01.680
THAT JUST LEAVES...

33:01.680 --> 33:03.382
(sniffles)

33:03.382 --> 33:05.254
JACK.

33:07.516 --> 33:09.758
(sniffles)

33:09.758 --> 33:12.121
I CAN'T SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HIM.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.025
THEN I'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

33:19.568 --> 33:21.070
YOU'RE UP LATE.

33:21.070 --> 33:23.672
HOW DID YOUR FATHER
TAKE THE NEWS?

33:23.672 --> 33:24.703
(sighs)

33:24.703 --> 33:27.736
HE TOOK IT
LIKE YOU'D EXPECT.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.781
EXCEPT HE SAID
SOMETHING ELSE THAT...

33:32.781 --> 33:34.743
I CAN'T GET OUT OF MY HEAD.

33:34.743 --> 33:36.185
OH, WHAT'S THAT?

33:36.185 --> 33:39.017
WELL, BASICALLY, THE REASON
WHY HE'S BEING SO NASTY

33:39.017 --> 33:41.690
IS BECAUSE OF SOME SECRET
YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING.

33:41.690 --> 33:44.393
OH, WE ALL HAVE SECRETS,
DANIEL.

33:44.393 --> 33:46.395
MOM...

33:46.395 --> 33:48.057
IT'S ME.

33:48.057 --> 33:49.428
ALL RIGHT?
SO WHATEVER IT IS,

33:49.428 --> 33:51.460
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
KEEP ME IN THE DARK.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.163
(sighs)

33:55.404 --> 33:57.806
WELL, THE TRUTH
IS INEVITABLE, DANIEL,

33:57.806 --> 34:02.471
AND I DO WANT
TO TELL YOU MYSELF.

34:02.471 --> 34:05.314
BUT I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK LESS OF ME.

34:05.314 --> 34:07.676
OH, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, MOM.

34:07.676 --> 34:10.079
JUST TELL ME.

34:11.719 --> 34:14.652
IT'S ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

34:14.652 --> 34:15.784
OKAY.

34:15.784 --> 34:17.826
WELL, WHAT--
WHAT ABOUT HER?

34:20.659 --> 34:22.531
CONRAD'S NOT HER FATHER.

34:30.839 --> 34:33.302
WHO'S CHARLOTTE'S FATHER?

34:36.074 --> 34:39.378
D-D-DAVID CLARKE.

34:42.351 --> 34:44.683
(cries)

34:44.683 --> 34:48.857
♪♪♪

34:55.864 --> 34:58.567
OH...

34:58.567 --> 35:00.199
ALL I WANTED TO...

35:00.199 --> 35:01.830
WAS TO PROTECT CHARLOTTE
FROM THE TRUTH.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.102
THAT'S ALL I WANTED.

35:08.477 --> 35:10.239
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU, MOM?

35:11.480 --> 35:14.213
PLEASE.
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.516
OH...

35:18.787 --> 35:21.650
(crying) I CAN'T.

35:21.650 --> 35:24.693
(continues crying)

35:24.693 --> 35:27.296
OH, MY GOD.

35:27.296 --> 35:29.898
OH, MY GOD, MOM.
COME HERE.

35:29.898 --> 35:32.130
(sobbing)
I'M SORRY, BABY. I'M SO SORRY.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.132
OH, GOD, MOM.
I AM SO SORRY.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.135
(continues sobbing)

35:44.713 --> 35:47.216
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

35:47.216 --> 35:48.717
IT'S A FREE BEACH.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.884
AMANDA'S GONE.

35:55.884 --> 35:57.586
YEAH, WELL, KUDOS TO YOU.

35:57.586 --> 36:00.259
LOOKS LIKE THE ENDS
 FINALLY JUSTIFIED THE MEANS.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.830
OR SHOULD I SAY MEANNESS?

36:01.830 --> 36:03.362
ARE YOU FINISHED?

36:03.362 --> 36:04.693
I DON'T KNOW.

36:04.693 --> 36:07.466
ARE YOU?

36:07.466 --> 36:09.898
I'LL NEVER BE FINISHED.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.503
BUT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
TO JACK, I...

36:14.503 --> 36:16.645
I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT I NEED
TO MINIMIZE THE FALLOUT

36:16.645 --> 36:18.607
FROM WHAT I'M DOING.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.782
I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME

36:23.782 --> 36:25.784
TO PRESS "PAUSE"
ON ALL OF THIS.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.687
AND DO WHAT?

36:28.687 --> 36:31.260
REGROUP.

36:31.260 --> 36:33.492
MAYBE THERE'S A BETTER WAY
TO LEVEL VICTORIA

36:33.492 --> 36:35.664
THAN BY MARRYING HER SON.

36:35.664 --> 36:39.268
AND... WHAT DO YOU PLAN
TO DO WITH DANIEL?

36:41.700 --> 36:43.232
(sighs)

36:43.232 --> 36:46.705
I'M GONNA
GIVE HIM HIS RING BACK.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.378
TELL HIM THAT...

36:49.378 --> 36:50.679
I NEED TO GIVE
MARRYING INTO HIS FAMILY

36:50.679 --> 36:52.811
SOME MORE THOUGHT...

36:52.811 --> 36:55.714
WHICH IS ACTUALLY
KIND OF TRUE.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.686
FOR ONCE.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.922
BABY STEPS.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.854
DON'T DO THAT.

37:13.702 --> 37:15.003
HEY.

37:15.003 --> 37:17.366
HEY, YOU'RE UP, FINALLY.

37:17.366 --> 37:18.807
(inhales sharply)

37:18.807 --> 37:21.570
OHH. WHERE'S AMANDA?

37:21.570 --> 37:24.373
(grunts)

37:24.373 --> 37:26.244
UH...

37:26.244 --> 37:27.816
(object clatters)

37:27.816 --> 37:29.678
SHE'S GONE, JACK.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.523
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GONE?

37:34.523 --> 37:36.285
(groans)

37:40.659 --> 37:42.391
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:43.832 --> 37:45.694
I'M SO SORRY, MAN.

37:45.694 --> 37:47.696
WHERE--WHERE--
WHERE WOULD SHE GO?

37:47.696 --> 37:50.899
I-I-- (sighs)

37:57.546 --> 37:58.877
(hinge squeaks)

37:58.877 --> 37:59.848
(beeps)

37:59.848 --> 38:01.009
(door closes)

38:01.009 --> 38:02.511
(safe beeps and clicks)

38:02.511 --> 38:04.653
CHARLOTTE?

38:06.485 --> 38:08.417
WHERE WERE YOU
THIS MORNING?

38:08.417 --> 38:11.059
WALKING ON THE BEACH.

38:11.059 --> 38:13.922
OH, SWEETHEART...

38:13.922 --> 38:15.924
I KNOW HOW MUCH
WHAT YOUR FATHER'S DONE

38:15.924 --> 38:17.896
HAS HURT YOU,

38:17.896 --> 38:20.769
BUT I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'VE COME BACK HOME.

38:20.769 --> 38:22.771
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
 NO.

38:22.771 --> 38:23.932
CHARLOTTE, PLEASE,

38:23.932 --> 38:26.074
PLEASE--
 MOM, JUST DON'T.

38:28.477 --> 38:32.040
(footsteps recede)

38:33.912 --> 38:36.945
(police radio chatter)

38:39.788 --> 38:41.790
(Conrad) I TOLD THEM WE WERE
RETIRING FOR THE EVENING.

38:41.790 --> 38:42.951
(clatters)

38:42.951 --> 38:44.853
BUT WE DO HAVE TO GIVE
OUR STATEMENTS

38:44.853 --> 38:47.025
IN THE MORNING.

38:47.025 --> 38:50.529
(radio chatter continues)

38:50.529 --> 38:52.631
ARE YOU OKAY?

38:52.631 --> 38:54.102
OF COURSE NOT.

38:54.102 --> 38:56.835
WHAT WE DID
WAS DESPICABLE.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.838
BUT NECESSARY.
YOU KNOW THAT.

39:01.910 --> 39:04.943
I LOVE YOU,
VICTORIA.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.945
I KNOW THAT, TOO.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.522
CONRAD...

39:19.658 --> 39:22.891
I CAN'T BEAR
BEING ALONE RIGHT NOW.

39:22.891 --> 39:24.963
WILL YOU STAY WITH ME
TONIGHT?

39:24.963 --> 39:27.936
I'D LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.

39:41.049 --> 39:44.453
FOR SOME,
COMMITMENT IS LIKE FAITH...

39:45.854 --> 39:47.856
A CHOSEN DEVOTION
TO ANOTHER PERSON

39:47.856 --> 39:50.919
OR AN INTANGIBLE IDEAL.

39:50.919 --> 39:52.921
BUT FOR ME,
COMMITMENT HAS A SHADOW SIDE,

39:52.921 --> 39:56.965
A DARKER DRIVE THAT CONSTANTLY
ASKS THE QUESTION...

39:56.965 --> 39:59.528
HOW FAR AM I WILLING TO GO?

40:06.635 --> 40:09.878
I WOKE UP,
AND YOU WERE GONE AGAIN.

40:09.878 --> 40:12.581
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

40:12.581 --> 40:14.583
WELL, YOU CRAWLED INTO BED
SO LATE,

40:14.583 --> 40:16.845
I THOUGHT I'D LET YOU
SLEEP A BIT.

40:16.845 --> 40:18.547
I KNOW. I--I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD--

40:18.547 --> 40:20.188
I SHOULD'VE NEVER
GONE TO SEE MY DAD.

40:20.188 --> 40:21.790
I SHOULD'VE STAYED
WITH YOU.

40:21.790 --> 40:24.022
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

40:26.525 --> 40:28.026
(exhales deeply)
I FOUND OUT

40:28.026 --> 40:30.198
WHY MY PARENTS' DIVORCE
IS SO CONTENTIOUS.

40:30.198 --> 40:31.860
TURNS OUT MY DAD

40:31.860 --> 40:35.804
ISN'T REALLY
CHARLOTTE'S FATHER.

40:35.804 --> 40:37.105
OH, MY GOD, DANIEL.

40:37.105 --> 40:38.837
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN
THE WORST OF IT.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.569
HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER
IS THAT MADMAN

40:40.569 --> 40:42.010
WHO USED TO LIVE
IN YOUR HOUSE--

40:42.010 --> 40:44.873
AMANDA'S FATHER,
THE TERRORIST.

40:46.174 --> 40:48.677
DOES CHARLOTTE KNOW?

40:48.677 --> 40:50.949
NO. I DON'T THINK
MY MOM EVER...

40:50.949 --> 40:52.881
INTENDS TO TELL HER.

40:52.881 --> 40:55.053
THE TRUTH
IS TOO HORRIBLE.

40:56.525 --> 40:58.787
BECAUSE OF WHAT
DAVID CLARKE

40:58.787 --> 41:00.028
WAS ACCUSED OF

41:00.028 --> 41:02.030
OR BECAUSE YOUR MOM WAS
UNFAITHFUL TO YOUR FATHER?

41:02.030 --> 41:03.732
NO, THAT'S JUST IT.

41:03.732 --> 41:06.765
SHE WASN'T UNFAITHFUL.

41:06.765 --> 41:09.838
THAT BASTARD
FORCED HIMSELF ON HER.

41:09.838 --> 41:13.602
OH, I'VE NEVER SEEN
MY MOTHER LIKE THAT.

41:18.246 --> 41:20.979
ARE YOU SAYING THAT...

41:20.979 --> 41:24.012
HE RAPED HER?

41:24.012 --> 41:26.985
AND GOT PREGNANT
WITH CHARLOTTE AS A RESULT.

41:29.017 --> 41:32.020
SHE SAID THIS TO YOU?

41:32.020 --> 41:33.762
(sighs)

41:33.762 --> 41:36.024
IF THAT SON OF A BITCH
WASN'T ROTTING IN HELL,

41:36.024 --> 41:39.528
I'D DRAG HIM DOWN
AND KILL HIM MYSELF.

41:41.770 --> 41:43.101
(sighs)

41:43.101 --> 41:46.104
ANYWAY, I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.608
SO WHAT GOT YOU UP
SO EARLY THIS MORNING.

41:49.608 --> 41:50.979
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE DONE SOME...

41:50.979 --> 41:53.011
HEAVY THINKING
OF YOUR OWN.

41:54.883 --> 41:56.214
I HAVE.

42:01.990 --> 42:04.022
HOW'S JUNE
FOR THE WEDDING?

42:04.022 --> 42:05.954
(chuckles)

42:05.954 --> 42:09.197
YOU STILL WANT TO MARRY
INTO MY CRAZY FAMILY?

42:09.197 --> 42:11.860
MORE THAN EVER.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.132
(chuckles)
