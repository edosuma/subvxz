00:01.935 --> 00:03.835
<i>Welcome to Tool Time on location.</i>

00:03.903 --> 00:07.634
And now the star of our show,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:10.877 --> 00:13.209
Whoaaaaa!

00:14.514 --> 00:16.539
<i>Thank you, Heidi. Welcome to Tool Time.</i>

00:16.616 --> 00:21.144
I am Tim "Yee-Haw Man" Taylor.

00:21.221 --> 00:24.349
Of course, you all know
my assistant, Mr. Al.

00:26.393 --> 00:28.759
Tim, come on. Where'd you put my shirt?

00:28.828 --> 00:31.388
Oh, now, that's not funny.

00:31.464 --> 00:33.955
Sad, actually.
The shirt's big on the horse.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.632
- Here you go, Al.
- Oh, you guys...

00:37.704 --> 00:39.672
Come on.

00:39.773 --> 00:44.107
We're here at Willow Run at
a blacksmith's shop. A special show...

00:44.177 --> 00:47.408
<i>Tool Time's Timeless Tools.</i>

00:47.480 --> 00:51.541
And we enlisted the help of
Delvin Horsted, our blacksmith. Delvin?

00:55.288 --> 00:57.848
- Welcome to the show, Delvin.
- Some welcome.

00:57.957 --> 01:02.121
You kept me waiting outside
my own shop by the manure pile.

01:02.195 --> 01:06.291
Well, that stinks.
And we're very sorry about that.

01:06.366 --> 01:09.995
But what a nice place
you have here, Delvin.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.528
Thank you. It was built in 1910
by my father Melvin.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.574
Ah.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.907
What was your grandpa's name,
Shmelvin?

01:22.582 --> 01:24.743
Yes.

01:26.086 --> 01:30.045
OK, Delvin, why don't you show us some
of the tools of the blacksmith trade?

01:30.156 --> 01:33.489
Well, the most important tool
to any blacksmith is his anvil.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.256
The anvil is where
the blacksmith hammers.

01:36.329 --> 01:38.820
In the old days
these were made out of cast iron.

01:38.898 --> 01:41.594
But today they're made
out of forged steel.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.562
Boy, that's an obnoxious noise.

01:47.440 --> 01:52.002
- I thought this was a tool show.
- It is.

01:52.078 --> 01:55.639
So why don't we take a look
at these tools right now?

01:55.748 --> 01:58.911
- Ooh, I know all about these.
- What do you know about tongs?

01:59.018 --> 02:02.977
Shh, quiet. It's the Chinese Mafia.

02:03.089 --> 02:05.057
These are 36-inch tongs.

02:05.158 --> 02:09.060
Oh. The kind that Al's mom
wears at the beach.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.097
I use them...

02:13.199 --> 02:16.498
I use them to take
heavy pieces of metal out of the fire.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.538
The length keeps my hands
away from the heat.

02:19.606 --> 02:24.100
Very important to a blacksmith. You keep
your hands soft and silky-smooth.

02:25.278 --> 02:27.838
I'm not the one wearing make-up.

02:30.016 --> 02:33.247
Behave yourself. Now we know
something about these tools,

02:33.319 --> 02:35.287
why don't we put 'em to work?

02:35.355 --> 02:38.381
This is Whiskey Pete.
Whiskey, how about some new shoes?

02:38.458 --> 02:40.949
Let's put her in an espadrille
or a slingback.

02:41.027 --> 02:43.996
- This is a horse!
- Of course! Of course!

02:45.198 --> 02:49.157
Delvin, what would be the first thing
you do when putting on new shoes?

02:49.235 --> 02:51.396
Well, first you take off the old shoe.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.734
You get a firm grip
on the animal's hoof

02:53.806 --> 02:55.967
and pull out the nails
with these pliers.

02:56.075 --> 02:58.407
Let me give that a shot.
Hold onto that hoof.

02:58.478 --> 03:01.970
I don't want that horse kicking me
and turning me into a gelding.

03:05.618 --> 03:08.951
My thumb! That's it! That's it!

03:09.022 --> 03:12.890
Let me show you tool boys
something else you can do with tongs.

03:15.395 --> 03:19.559
We'll be right back
after these words from Binford.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.020 --> 04:17.978
If you want, I can hold that
across the room for you.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.355
This is a very comfortable position
for reading.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.556
Face it, Mom. You need glasses.

04:25.632 --> 04:29.090
Don't be ridiculous.
I've always had excellent eyesight.

04:29.168 --> 04:32.604
Yeah, but now you're old.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.402
Excuse me. I come from good eye stock.

04:35.475 --> 04:38.239
Nobody in my family
has ever needed glasses.

04:38.344 --> 04:41.677
Mom, have you driven
with Grandma lately?

04:41.748 --> 04:44.649
Guys, think about it.
Do I look like an old person?

04:44.717 --> 04:48.551
Do I act like an old person?
Do I move like an old person?

04:48.621 --> 04:51.181
So many questions, so little time.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.719
- What he said.
- Yeah.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.059
Oh, come on. I am not old.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.259
I am youthful. I am full of youth.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.826
I'm vibrant. I'm in my prime.

05:10.543 --> 05:13.034
Do you want me to hold that
from over here?

05:15.014 --> 05:17.881
My big brother's in town.
You know what that means.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.646
- Dusting off the old bald jokes?
- Yeah.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.149
Hey, Jeff. I love
what you've done with your hair.

05:24.223 --> 05:27.454
- And...?
- That's as far as I've gotten.

05:27.527 --> 05:30.985
My mom invited Marty and me
over for dinner. Wanna join us?

05:31.064 --> 05:34.329
I gotta do some homework.
Besides, you guys can catch up.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.892
- I can get that $1200 back he owes me.
- Yeah, forget about it.

05:37.970 --> 05:41.736
They say if you loan money to family,
you gotta think of it as a gift.

05:41.808 --> 05:45.073
However, this was not a gift.
It was a business loan.

05:45.144 --> 05:49.240
And his business is up and running.
A perfect time to get that money back.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.943
Jeff's a great guy,
but he's not great with money.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.351
- You're never gonna see a dime of that.
- Really?

05:55.421 --> 05:58.788
I say tonight
I come back with that money,

05:58.858 --> 06:02.123
or... or I'll give up a day
with the hot rod to spend with you.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.961
And how romantic that'll be
under those circumstances.

06:07.066 --> 06:10.297
- Don't worry. It's never gonna happen.
- Gonna happen.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.970
<i>- Who is it?
- It's Avon calling, ma'am.</i>

06:19.045 --> 06:23.209
<i>I've got a peach blush
that's to die for.</i>

06:23.316 --> 06:26.080
- Come on in.
- Hey, Jeff. Tim's here.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.085
And if I were you, I'd put on a hat.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.852
- Jeffrey.
- Tim.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.862
- Good seeing you.
- Good seeing you.

06:37.930 --> 06:41.195
Hmm. I love what you've done
with your hair.

06:41.267 --> 06:44.327
- Uh-huh.
- Where do you keep it?

06:46.939 --> 06:49.806
On your back.

06:50.676 --> 06:54.442
- OK. Come on, boys. Don't start.
- Marty, get me a beer, will you?

06:54.514 --> 06:57.677
- Yeah.
- Whatever you're cooking smells great.

06:57.784 --> 07:02.278
Jeff cooked the dinner. Used his own
recipe and his own pots and pans.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.085
You're traveling with cookware now?

07:05.158 --> 07:10.027
I check the pots curbside. The spatulas
and the skillets are carry-ons.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.361
Now you boys are both here,
we've got something to tell you.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.800
There is a reason that Jeff
is traveling with pots and pans.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.030
Jeff's become a Gypsy.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.836
That's perfect. You can wear a babushka
now to cover everything up.

07:22.909 --> 07:26.345
Jeff's new business didn't work out
quite as well as he'd hoped,

07:26.412 --> 07:29.506
so he's gonna be living here
for a while.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.880
- You're kidding?
- I thought it was on track.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.920
Well, I thought so, too,
but it's this darn economy.

07:35.021 --> 07:39.185
<i>The economy hasn't been this good
since they sunk the Lusitania.</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:42.853
I think the world just wasrt ready
for a drive-through pet shop.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.396
It was Wal-Mutt, right?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.161
Auto-Pet.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.759
Jeff was a little ahead of his time,
that's all.

07:50.837 --> 07:53.670
But he's got great ideas
for what he's gonna do next.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.900
I haven't forgotten
that money I owe you.

07:56.008 --> 07:58.101
Money? What money?

07:58.177 --> 08:00.304
You'll get it back sooner than you think

08:00.379 --> 08:04.213
because I'll be saving a lot of money
living here with Mommy... Mom, Mom!

08:06.285 --> 08:10.119
Wait a minute. You're a grown man
who's gonna let his mother cook for him

08:10.189 --> 08:13.647
and clean for him,
and take care of him when he's sick?

08:13.726 --> 08:16.251
You're a lucky S.O.B.

08:31.010 --> 08:31.977
Mom.

08:32.078 --> 08:36.344
OK, OK. All right. I am
a very old woman who needs glasses.

08:36.414 --> 08:38.280
There. I said it. Are you happy?

08:39.184 --> 08:43.019
Actually, I was just gonna ask you
to pass the butter.

08:43.089 --> 08:47.583
If you're so freaked out about getting
glasses, why don't you get contacts?

08:47.660 --> 08:49.560
I only need them for reading.

08:49.629 --> 08:52.598
I'll be putting them in
and taking them out all day long.

08:52.698 --> 08:56.964
You could get those glasses on a chain
like our librarian, Mrs. Potemkin.

08:58.771 --> 09:01.467
- Morning, everybody.
- Where were you last night?

09:01.541 --> 09:05.443
- I didn't even hear you come in.
- You know those Taylor get-togethers.

09:05.511 --> 09:10.949
We start reminiscing, next thing we're
all oiled up, wrestling for quarters.

09:11.017 --> 09:16.114
I tell you, that mother-in-law of yours
can do a fierce body slam. Ba-da-bing!

09:16.188 --> 09:18.349
Did you ask Jeff for the money?

09:18.457 --> 09:22.484
No. You know that drive-through
pet store he had?

09:22.562 --> 09:25.531
Yeah. What was that called?
Cat-In-The-Box.

09:26.966 --> 09:30.800
He lost his business. He doesn't have
any money. He's moving in with Mom.

09:30.870 --> 09:34.966
A 45-year-old man
living with his mother. That's sad.

09:35.041 --> 09:39.205
Well, you might wanna see where you are
in 30 years and then make that call.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.172
- Poor Jeff.
- I hate to see him struggle.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.218
See you, guys.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.287
See you, Dad.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.088
Morning.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.683
Hello, Jeff.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.728
Yeah.

10:00.199 --> 10:03.168
OK. Sure, after work. Thanks.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.237
Bye.

10:09.775 --> 10:14.144
You might find some bottles
with bigger print on them.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.579
- I don't believe that.
- What?

10:16.682 --> 10:19.173
Jeff wants to come over
and borrow my finger.

10:19.251 --> 10:22.379
I won't ask.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.515
That big foam finger
I use at the hockey games?

10:25.591 --> 10:30.927
He's got a date. He got front-row seats
to see the Red Wings tonight.

10:30.997 --> 10:35.093
- Front-row seats? Isn't that expensive?
- Yeah. He paid a fortune for 'em.

10:35.167 --> 10:39.331
A fortune he could be using to pay me
back or give Mom some rent money.

10:39.405 --> 10:42.238
- Are you gonna talk to him about it?
- You bet I will.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.072
I'll talk to him tonight
when I give him the finger.

10:49.715 --> 10:54.482
Oh, good. Randy, I want you to see this.
What do you think? Pair number one.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.885
- Très Mr. Magoo.
- Oh.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.121
OK, OK, Tim, Tim.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.561
what do you think of these?

11:14.206 --> 11:16.174
They make your butt look big.

11:18.544 --> 11:20.512
They do?

11:21.247 --> 11:23.807
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- Oh, my God! They do!

11:23.883 --> 11:26.647
They make my butt look big.

11:26.719 --> 11:31.019
Trust me, honey. Your butt looked
just as big before you put 'em on.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.824
There's probably a better way
to say that.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.056
Yeah, but don't bother
trying to find it.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.793
I'm just gonna go up
and look in a full-length mirror.

11:44.437 --> 11:48.533
If you had different glasses,
you wouldn't have to cover that thing.

11:48.607 --> 11:51.440
- Hello to you, too, Jeff.
- Hey, Tim.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.842
- Where's your date?
- Right here.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.642
Whoo-hee! And what a looker!

11:55.715 --> 11:58.878
My date stood me up, so I figured
I'd treat my little brother.

11:58.984 --> 12:02.283
Yeah. He said if I'm good,
he'd buy me a Sno-Cone.

12:02.354 --> 12:07.724
I'd like to talk to Jeff in private.
Go stick my finger in your back seat.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.725
You make it sound so dirty.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.634
- So, what's up?
- It's none of my business,

12:18.704 --> 12:21.537
but how are you affording
expensive hockey tickets?

12:21.607 --> 12:25.873
- Well, I'm celebrating my new business.
- You opened up a new business?

12:25.945 --> 12:29.472
I had this brainstorm
for a mailbox-and-shipping store.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.982
- There's a problem, isn't there?
- What?

12:32.051 --> 12:35.487
- You're broke.
- Not anymore. Got a very generous loan.

12:35.554 --> 12:40.253
It'd be tough to get a bank loan
when your last business went belly-up.

12:40.326 --> 12:43.693
I got a private backer,
and there's the money that I owe you.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.732
- Sorry it took so long to get it back.
- A private backer?

12:46.799 --> 12:48.892
Someone gave you cash for all...?

12:48.968 --> 12:51.493
- Yeah.
- Who's the private backer?

12:51.570 --> 12:54.733
Oh, I thought I mentioned it. Mom. Bye.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.808
Jeff!

13:01.113 --> 13:05.243
Well, I figured out how come Jeff
could afford expensive hockey tickets,

13:05.317 --> 13:08.684
pay off his loan in cash
and open a new business.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.120
Well, what did he do? Rob a bank?

13:11.190 --> 13:14.318
Yeah, the Bank of Mom.
He got her to crack open her nest egg

13:14.393 --> 13:17.157
so he could open
a mailbox-and-shipping business.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.697
Oh, my God. With Jeff's luck,

13:19.765 --> 13:23.030
he'll turn it into another
one of those K-Mutts.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.329
I'm gonna go over after the hockey game

13:26.405 --> 13:30.341
and tell Mr. Chrome Dome about fiscal
responsibility. I gotta tell him...

13:30.409 --> 13:33.071
You can talk to him
till you're blue in the face.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.113
What am I supposed to do about it?

13:35.214 --> 13:39.173
Maybe I should go over there
and beat him up with my big butt.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.558
Full house. Queens high.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.117
Oh, no.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.925
Who is it?

13:51.997 --> 13:55.728
<i>The FBI, ma'am.
I'm here for your strip search.</i>

13:55.801 --> 13:58.099
It's all right. It's only Tim.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.400
I love your son in that show.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.963
They should just get rid
of the obnoxious one

14:03.042 --> 14:06.273
that's always breaking things.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.845
I think you're a little mixed-up.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.883
- Hi, Mom. Oh, hi.
- Hi.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.817
This broke outside.
It wasrt me, I swear.

14:15.988 --> 14:18.650
- Give me a screwdriver.
- Never mind. Never mind.

14:18.724 --> 14:21.090
Say hello to Gwen, Bertha,
Alice and Lois.

14:21.193 --> 14:26.529
Oh, hello, Tim.
So you finally got a toupee.

14:28.300 --> 14:32.862
No. That's my older brother Jeff.
This isn't a toupee.

14:32.972 --> 14:35.270
Whatever you say.

14:36.609 --> 14:40.238
- So, speaking of Jeff, is he here?
- He'll be back any second.

14:40.312 --> 14:43.975
Say, while you're waiting,
would you like to play a little poker?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.017
I couldn't take your money, ladies.

14:51.390 --> 14:55.019
Suddenly I am tired.

14:55.094 --> 14:59.258
It's funny how fatigue sets in
after winning all my money.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.429
Hey, Tim, ladies.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.560
Lucille, walk me home, will you?

15:04.637 --> 15:09.165
All this money that I won from Tim is
putting a lot of weight on my bad hip.

15:09.241 --> 15:13.200
Double or nothing? Let's get oiled up
and I'll wrestle you for it.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.473
I'd crush you like a grape.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.249
- You missed one heck of a game, bud.
- Did I?

15:21.320 --> 15:25.188
I'd like to hang onto your finger.
I've got tickets for next week's game.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.226
We heard about your new business.
Sounds wonderful.

15:28.294 --> 15:31.730
Maybe you should just give up
your little TV skits

15:31.797 --> 15:34.823
and follow in your brother's footsteps.

15:36.468 --> 15:40.404
Well, I would, but I'd like to leave
my mom some money to retire on.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.272
What's that mean?

15:43.342 --> 15:47.301
Why are you borrowing money from Mom
to start another fly-by-night business

15:47.413 --> 15:48.937
and take money to pay me off?

15:49.014 --> 15:52.108
First of all,
this is between Mom and me, OK?

15:52.184 --> 15:54.152
Second of all, she gave me the money

15:54.253 --> 15:57.313
because she thinks
my fly-by-night business is a good idea.

15:57.389 --> 16:00.552
- Like Poodle Town?
- Auto-Pet.

16:00.659 --> 16:05.187
I don't have to be talked to this way.
I'm your older brother, not a child.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.425
I'm going to my room.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.435
- Hey, Wilson.
- Hi-ho, Tim.

16:12.538 --> 16:15.769
I saw your light was on.
What are you doing to the Studebaker?

16:15.841 --> 16:18.810
Nothing very interesting.
Just draining my radiator.

16:18.877 --> 16:22.404
Well, I'd rather watch that
than watch my brother drain my mother.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.415
Who wouldn't?

16:24.483 --> 16:27.941
Jeff got my mom to give him a big loan
to start a new business.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.387
A new business? Whatever happened
to Long John Schnauzer's?

16:31.490 --> 16:34.721
Well, that folded.
Now he's onto his next failure.

16:34.793 --> 16:38.820
Oh, yes, I see. So you're worried
about your mom losing her money.

16:38.897 --> 16:43.766
Yeah. I talked to Jeff about it and
he just said it's none of my business.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.294
Well, it's true,
but considering Jeff's track record,

16:47.373 --> 16:50.137
the concerns you have
are totally understandable.

16:50.242 --> 16:54.906
Yeah. So I'm caught
between a rock and a bald guy.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.609
Tim, I can't find the drain plug
to this thing. Can you give me a hand?

16:58.684 --> 17:02.142
It's an old Studebaker.
It's on the left side. Got a lantern?

17:02.221 --> 17:04.189
Right here.

17:10.429 --> 17:13.921
<i>Looks like it came off a ship.
Where'd you get it? Off the Titanic?</i>

17:13.999 --> 17:15.762
Yes.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.631
Have you considered talking to your mom?

17:20.739 --> 17:23.502
- I can't talk to my mom about this.
- Why not?

17:23.608 --> 17:28.272
Tell her that I think that
her oldest son, my brother, is a loser?

17:28.347 --> 17:30.975
If that is the case,
it'll hurt her feelings,

17:31.050 --> 17:34.349
but isn't that better than seeing
her savings wiped out?

17:34.420 --> 17:36.980
So I should just put everything
out on the table?

17:37.089 --> 17:38.920
I'm reminded of the famous words,

17:38.991 --> 17:43.155
"When in doubt, tell the truth."
Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

17:43.228 --> 17:47.358
That big can'toon rooster?
Well, I say, boy... Well, I say, boy...

17:47.433 --> 17:49.958
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.595
See, Samuel Clemens
is the real name of Mark Twain,

17:52.704 --> 17:54.672
one of America's greatest thinkers.

17:54.773 --> 17:57.640
Well, that big chickers pretty smart.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.474
Gave that dog a run for his money.

18:01.547 --> 18:05.677
I say, boy, I say, boy, that dog
is dumber than a sack of wet beans.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.117
- Is Jeff home?
- No.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.282
He's out looking for packing materials
for his new store.

18:12.357 --> 18:16.657
That's what I wanna talk about. I don't
think you should loan him the money.

18:16.728 --> 18:17.990
You don't?

18:18.063 --> 18:23.558
- I think he's taking advantage of you.
- Oh. I can look after myself, Tim.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.330
Save some money for a rainy day.

18:25.404 --> 18:28.373
You never know
when you're gonna blow out a hip.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.509
Look, I've invested pretty well
over the years.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.548
And I can afford to take a risk
if I really believe in it,

18:36.648 --> 18:38.775
like Jeff's mailbox business.

18:39.685 --> 18:44.622
He can have his grand opening sale and
going-out-of-business sale in one day.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.750
Tim, Jeff has really done
his homework this time.

18:47.826 --> 18:51.785
These places do very well.
And he's found a very good location.

18:51.897 --> 18:55.196
So when he hits you up for money,
you just fork it over to him?

18:55.267 --> 18:59.294
He didn't hit me up for the money.
I had to talk him into taking it.

18:59.371 --> 19:03.671
Wait a minute. You talked him into this?
You believe in this that much?

19:03.742 --> 19:08.008
- Well, why didn't he tell me this?
- Well, I'm sure he was embarrassed.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.941
Your approval means a lot to him, Tim.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.416
Since when did he care what I think?

19:14.520 --> 19:20.083
You guys give each other a hard time,
but deep down, Jeff truly admires you.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.592
I don't think so.

19:21.660 --> 19:26.927
Honey, you've got everything
in the world that he'd like to have.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.526
You've got a successful career,
you've got a great family...

19:30.602 --> 19:32.570
Hair.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.438
Yeah. That, too.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.741
I'd love to see Jeff
get some of that good stuff.

19:40.812 --> 19:44.714
That's why I gave him the money.
I'd do the same for you, honey.

19:45.717 --> 19:49.983
Boy, Mom, you cannot believe all the
shipping material out there these days.

19:50.055 --> 19:52.216
Packing peanuts, foam popcorn...

19:52.291 --> 19:55.624
Makes me thirsty
for a Scotch tape and soda.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.858
Oh, you. Are you here to convince Mom
that I'm a bad risk?

19:59.965 --> 20:02.627
- No, Jeff. I just came over to talk.
- This is good.

20:02.701 --> 20:06.432
OK, I just think I'll go out
and pop some bubbles.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.500
Whoo-hoo-hoo! This is so much fun!

20:12.744 --> 20:15.212
She's slipping already.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.772
Look, um, I was out of line
for coming down on you, you know.

20:18.850 --> 20:22.411
This is none of my business and she has
every right to loan you money.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.684
How much did she pay you to say that?

20:25.757 --> 20:28.317
There's nothing left.
You cleaned her out.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.260
- Oh, yeah. Here we go again.
- Oh, Jeff, come on.

20:31.330 --> 20:36.199
Mom says you've done your homework
on this one and it's a real solid idea.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.236
You think so? God, I hope so.

20:38.337 --> 20:42.774
I just can't take another failure
like Jiffy Pup.

20:45.377 --> 20:48.244
It was Auto-Pet.
And you were just ahead of your time.

20:49.147 --> 20:53.015
- Thanks.
- If Mom believes in you, so do I.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.450
I appreciate that.

20:54.519 --> 20:57.977
I'm just telling the truth,
like a famous American said we should.

20:58.056 --> 21:02.220
- What famous American?
- Come on. Samuel Foghorn Leghorn.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.729
He was one smart chicken.

21:06.832 --> 21:11.769
No, I'm talking about Mark Twain.
The guy that wrote Huckleberry Hound.

21:12.971 --> 21:16.031
When you were a kid,
did Mom drop you on your head?

21:16.108 --> 21:19.669
Yeah. The same day she dunked
your head in that vat of Nair.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.313
- Hey, you got new reading glasses.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.881
After checking out 300 frames,
I finally found the perfect pair.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.688
And they're very cool.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.286
Extremely slimming.

21:38.363 --> 21:41.799
For what they cost me, I could've hired
somebody to read for me.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.233
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Lucille.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.830
- Sorry I'm late.
- I'm having trouble with this recipe.

21:47.906 --> 21:51.069
What does this mean
when they say coddle an egg?

21:51.176 --> 21:56.944
Oh, hello, egg.
Look at your cute little yolk.

21:57.015 --> 21:58.983
Let me look at this here.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.652
Oh, my God. You have
the same Gianni Firenzi glasses.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.694
I didn't know what they were called.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.525
They were giving them away
at the car wash.
