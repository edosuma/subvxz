00:17.285 --> 00:18.719
Calvin.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.954
Calvin.

00:21.055 --> 00:21.955
Calvin!

00:22.056 --> 00:23.691
Yeah, what? What?

00:23.791 --> 00:24.858
What?

00:24.958 --> 00:27.595
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
Did I wake you?

00:28.396 --> 00:32.233
You could've woke
the dead, Tina.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.068
Do you hear that scratching?

00:34.168 --> 00:36.104
What? That?

00:36.204 --> 00:38.372
Shh! Don't talk!

00:38.472 --> 00:41.575
That.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.178
I don't know. M-Maybe
it's a spider or something.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.614
Spiders don't make noise.

00:49.483 --> 00:52.153
All right, well, it sounds like
it's coming from the kitchen.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.288
It's got to be
Malcolm and Marty.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.023
At 5:00 in the morning?

00:56.124 --> 00:59.693
With all that legal weed
out there? Absolutely.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.762
I don't know, Calvin.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.797
It-it sounds like it
could be an animal.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.932
Could you just go look?

01:05.032 --> 01:06.700
Hey, I'll look
when I get up, okay?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.536
Oh, baby, I don't...
All right.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.775
Mm-mm, mm-mm,
mm-mm, no, no.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.145
Baby, please.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.579
I cannot sleep with that.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.913
Just-just go check it out.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.715
Fine.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.284
I mean, you know...

01:23.384 --> 01:26.220
But once I brush my teeth,
that's usually it for me.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.926
So much for gender equality.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.062
Thank you, baby.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.364
Whoa!

01:36.464 --> 01:37.898
What?!

01:37.998 --> 01:39.700
Get out! Get out of here!
What, what, what, what?

01:39.800 --> 01:40.968
Get out of here!
What, what?

01:41.068 --> 01:42.836
Oh, you picked the
wrong house tonight.

01:42.936 --> 01:43.771
Babe?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.038
Babe, you good?

01:45.173 --> 01:47.341
Give me back my slipper!

01:47.441 --> 01:48.742
Slipper? Oh. All right.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.544
Well, it sounds like you got it.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.617
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:56.717 --> 01:58.085
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

02:00.654 --> 02:02.456
Oh. Oh.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.624
Oh, my God.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.793
What was it?
I don't know, baby.

02:05.893 --> 02:10.063
Either it was a large raccoon
or a small panda.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.734
Well, did you have
to make this big a mess?

02:13.834 --> 02:16.237
I didn't do it. That thing did.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.639
Look, babe, when I came in here,
that's when he saw me.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.073
And then we squared off, right?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.410
Now, he had eyes
as red as the devil.

02:22.510 --> 02:26.347
So then, so then I hit him with
the two-piece. Hey, hey. Hey.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.815
Hey. So then, but he's like,

02:27.915 --> 02:29.550
"Oh, what's up?
What's up with that?"

02:29.650 --> 02:32.220
Then I was like, "Oh!" So then,
so then he came at me, right?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.521
So then I grabbed him,
I was like, ugh,

02:33.621 --> 02:35.122
and I put him in a full nelson.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.490
And I was choking him,
he's like, "Aah!"

02:36.590 --> 02:37.725
And I was choking him. But then,

02:37.825 --> 02:39.427
but then he flipped me
back over.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.562
So then he started choking me,
and I was like, "Get off me."

02:41.662 --> 02:44.131
But his hands was too small
to go around my whole neck

02:44.232 --> 02:46.734
so he couldn't get
around my whole neck.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.101
So then I hit him
with the Ice Cube,

02:48.236 --> 02:49.370
I was like,
"Yo, we got a problem here?"

02:49.470 --> 02:50.871
Right? So then,

02:50.971 --> 02:52.240
then he came running at me.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.841
I grabbed him, I flipped him
around here,

02:53.941 --> 02:55.976
and I field-goaled him
out the front door.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.711
Whew.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.616
Oh, my God!

03:02.716 --> 03:06.320
There's footprints
in my lasagna!

03:06.420 --> 03:08.922
Well, what does
the pest control guy say?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.324
Well, nothing, babe.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.260
I'm still hearing
the hold music,

03:12.360 --> 03:14.762
but I ain't mad because
they playing the Whispers.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.267
Calvin.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.869
Can you call another company?

03:21.969 --> 03:24.538
Babe, I'm a half hour
invested on this one.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.140
If you can't get a pest
control guy on the phone,

03:27.275 --> 03:30.278
I'm calling a Realtor, and if
he answers first, we're moving.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.845
Wait, hold on.
I'm not doing this.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.381
Whoa-whoa-whoa, bab-baby...
I'm not doing...

03:33.481 --> 03:34.548
Representative.

03:34.648 --> 03:39.086
Representative.
Representative.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.187
Agent.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.690
Operator.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.292
Person.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.594
Yes, English.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.862
Or Spanish? <i>¡Nosotros!</i>

03:52.833 --> 03:55.303
Don't mean to
be pest-imistic,

03:55.403 --> 03:56.504
but, uh...

03:56.604 --> 03:57.971
it was definitely a raccoon.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.475
So we're going to put down
like 16 bear traps?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.711
We could, if you sign
a waiver saying

04:03.811 --> 04:07.047
we're not responsible for
anybody losing a leg or a child.

04:07.147 --> 04:10.217
Well, we don't have a child,
so where do we sign?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.320
Tina, what are you doing?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.554
You're just throwing
all this food away?

04:13.654 --> 04:16.023
I'm not eating
raccoon-touched food.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.225
Have you ever seen
a raccoon wash his hands?

04:19.059 --> 04:20.328
They actually do.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.695
There's this great video
on YouTube where...

04:21.795 --> 04:23.364
Oh, oh, yeah,
I seen that.

04:23.464 --> 04:27.335
'Cause they look like little
people. They like...

04:29.470 --> 04:30.471
You mind if
I check inside?

04:30.571 --> 04:31.872
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, go ahead.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.073
Uh, look at all this
food you're wasting.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.342
You know, Tina,

04:34.342 --> 04:37.411
I recently
started composting.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.612
Yeah, I know.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.080
For a man
with a job,

04:40.180 --> 04:42.616
you spend a lot of time
digging in my garbage.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.487
Tina, did you
get my text?

04:46.587 --> 04:47.588
Probably.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.890
Child, I didn't look. What?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.727
School's canceled today
'cause of the fires

04:53.827 --> 04:55.128
up in the mountains.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.564
Air quality is
unsafe for the kids. Oh.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.266
That never happened
in Hickory Corners.

04:59.367 --> 05:02.035
We had closures for blizzards,
tornadoes, frogs.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.571
Frogs?

05:03.671 --> 05:07.040
After the tornadoes,
it would actually rain frogs.

05:07.808 --> 05:12.380
Gemma, where are you from?
The Book of Leviticus?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.016
We had really nice Octobers.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.986
I know today was
the day you were going to post

05:19.086 --> 05:22.222
the casting decisions for the
spring musical, but you'll...

05:22.390 --> 05:25.693
Wow, a raccoon
did all of this?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.861
Calvin helped.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.262
Hey.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.031
Okay, it's looking like

05:31.131 --> 05:33.100
your point of entry
is your chimney.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.469
We can put a mesh cap
at the top to inhibit access.

05:35.569 --> 05:40.608
Ooh, let's put two in
for safety-- and electrify it.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.678
So this mesh thing
is gonna stop the raccoons?

05:44.778 --> 05:45.946
And Santa Claus.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.016
'Cause, you see, 'cause...

05:49.116 --> 05:50.984
the chimney is where...

05:51.084 --> 05:52.853
that's where Santa comes down. Yeah.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.323
Hilarious. I get it.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.426
Truth is, if they want in,

05:58.426 --> 06:00.428
they're gonna find
another access point.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.729
Best thing to do is
to figure out what's

06:01.829 --> 06:03.564
attracting them
in the first place.

06:03.664 --> 06:07.435
Some new food source around--
fruit trees, dumpsters?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.739
Dave!

06:15.242 --> 06:17.110
Dave?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.979
Do you know what
your compost is doing?
Ooh!

06:19.079 --> 06:21.148
I have been waiting
for you to ask me that.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.217
I'm returning
organic waste to the soil

06:24.317 --> 06:25.853
instead of letting
it rot in landfills.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.020
Well, guess what.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.556
It's attracting raccoons.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.224
Aw. You know, composting brings

06:31.324 --> 06:33.326
all the creatures together.

06:33.461 --> 06:37.164
Not "aw." One of them
broke into my house,

06:37.264 --> 06:39.467
and now I don't have
a left slipper.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.535
What am I supposed
to do with one slipper?

06:41.635 --> 06:42.470
Huh?

06:42.470 --> 06:43.904
Hello, Mr. Raccoon.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.539
Come get your other slipper!

06:49.009 --> 06:50.711
Mama, where's all the food?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.680
I'm not keeping any food
in this house

06:52.780 --> 06:54.915
after some rodent
trampled all over it.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.185
Well, actually, uh,
raccoons are not Rodentia,

06:58.285 --> 06:59.352
they are Carnivora.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.489
Which is kind of a misnomer

07:01.489 --> 07:03.090
because they're
omnivorous, so...

07:04.825 --> 07:07.194
Yo, Marty.
Read the room.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.732
Wait, so are you saying
there is no food in this house?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.401
Looks like you'll
have to eat at home.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.270
But we don't have
food at home.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.508
I mean, we knew this day
would come.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.512
You think you'll be ready
for it, but you're not.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.982
Okay, look, we're all going
to need food, all right?

07:29.082 --> 07:31.051
Why don't you guys
go pick up some takeout?

07:31.151 --> 07:32.319
Oh, okay. Okay.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.922
Got you, Mama.
Whatever you want. Uh...

07:35.022 --> 07:36.590
Credit card?

07:38.391 --> 07:39.426
It's our treat.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.761
Yeah, I'm sure.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.932
Hey.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.433
About those auditions

07:46.534 --> 07:48.035
for the spring musical.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.671
You know that seventh
grader Cooper Brockwell?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.973
You were probably wondering
if he's the same Brockwell

07:53.073 --> 07:55.876
as in the school's Brockwell
Performing Arts Center.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.444
I wasn't wondering.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.281
Oh, good.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.283
But he is.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.686
Oh, so wait a minute.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.589
Are you saying that I have
to cast this Brockwell kid

08:08.689 --> 08:10.457
because his parents
paid for the theater?

08:10.558 --> 08:11.759
Grandparents.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.827
His parents paid
for the library.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.698
And no, of course
I'm not saying that.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.700
You should cast
whoever's the best.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.868
Great.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.070
Was Cooper the best?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.872
Oh, no.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.440
I'm just glad you don't feel
any pressure to cast him

08:27.575 --> 08:29.109
just because, without
his grandfather,

08:29.209 --> 08:31.712
there wouldn't be
a musical at all.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.448
You know, now I'm feeling
a little pressure.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.851
No, don't, don't, don't.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.420
It is a nice theater,
though, isn't it?

08:40.588 --> 08:42.222
Oh, my God.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.594
It's always just one
thing after another with you.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.796
Remember when you installed
those solar panels?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.497
Yeah, I reduced
my carbon footprint

08:50.598 --> 08:52.499
and I cut my
utility bill in half.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.735
Wrong. You caused a blackout,

08:54.835 --> 08:57.004
and I had to stop a mob
from beating your ass.

08:57.104 --> 09:00.140
And what about when you
started collecting rainwater?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.441
We were in a drought.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.176
I decreased my
water consumption.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.913
And this neighborhood
was swarming with mosquitoes.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.616
The kid down the street
got bit in his eye.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.618
I had to stop his daddy
from beating your ass.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.419
Okay. Well, to be fair,

09:12.519 --> 09:15.689
that was the same guy
from the blackout, and...

09:15.789 --> 09:17.190
I think he has
anger issues.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.293
Okay.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.529
Oh, look, it's one of
those emergency alerts.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.931
It says that there's a...

09:24.031 --> 09:26.066
mountain lion loose
in the neighborhood.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.335
Wait a second.
You guys got an alert?

09:28.435 --> 09:29.469
I didn't get an alert.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.774
It's telling us
to shelter in place.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.009
You all are getting this?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.779
It's only my phone
that doesn't care about me?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.882
Remain indoors until
Animal Control

09:41.982 --> 09:44.551
can find and
sedate the lion.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.086
Ha! You ain't got
to tell me.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.188
Yeah, with Black people,
you just need two words,

09:48.288 --> 09:51.124
"mountain" and "lion,"
and we ain't going out there.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.966
100-year-old Bernice
Truck has always had a dream.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.601
There's a mountain lion
loose in the neighborhood,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.570
and all the local news
wants to talk about

10:03.671 --> 10:06.106
is a 100-year-old
lady who's skydiving.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.442
I mean, at this point,
what's she really risking?

10:09.542 --> 10:12.245
Baby, don't say that.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.246
Hold on.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.816
Grover's home.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.985
Our son is in
our house alone.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.620
No. What? You can't go
out there, Gemma.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.856
There's a mountain lion.
Are you crazy?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.258
See? That's why they
need those alerts.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.662
Okay, Gemma, look,
let's not panic.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.997
All right, he's fine.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.431
He's in the house.
The doors are shut.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.366
Grover knows not to open
the door for strangers.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.002
What about mountain lions?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.369
Okay, well, Gemma,
if Grover doesn't know

10:36.469 --> 10:37.771
not to open the door
for a mountain lion,

10:37.871 --> 10:39.272
we have bigger problems.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.812
Grover. Grover, can you hear me?

10:46.579 --> 10:47.815
Hey, Mom.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.683
There's a mountain lion
on the loose.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.719
I know. I got
an alert on my phone.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.721
You got to be kidding me.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.623
Yeah-- my phone wants me dead.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.059
Grover.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.493
Stay inside.

11:00.728 --> 11:04.331
Don't open the door
for any person... or animal.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.134
We'll be over as soon as we can.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.869
So, first I don't get to go

11:08.969 --> 11:10.403
to school because of a fire,

11:10.503 --> 11:12.405
and now I have to hang out
in my house

11:12.505 --> 11:15.308
without supervision
for who knows how long?

11:15.408 --> 11:17.845
I know, sweetie.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.015
Poor little thing.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.288
If this is
the <i>House of the Dragon,</i>

11:28.388 --> 11:29.757
then where's the dragon?

11:29.857 --> 11:32.760
This is nothing but ladies
taking baths.

11:34.862 --> 11:38.265
Mom would definitely say
this is not appropriate.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.235
But Mom's not here.

11:44.137 --> 11:48.075
And we will also have the
Carolina pulled pork sandwich.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.477
Oh, yeah, bread on the side
so it doesn't get soggy.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.780
Yeah, uh, bread on the side.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.181
Extra sauce,
also on the side.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.884
Extra sauce, please.
Mm-hmm.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.852
On the side.
On the side.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.387
Don't let it
touch the bread.

12:01.688 --> 12:04.124
And we will also have
the full rack of ribs.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.194
Oh, is that more
Memphis style or Texas style?

12:07.294 --> 12:11.331
They are pig style, Marty. Okay.

12:11.431 --> 12:16.169
Oh, ask if their coleslaw
is more soupy or dry.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.606
Would you hold on
for one second, please?

12:20.707 --> 12:22.275
No, I will not
ask them that.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.445
They about to spit
in our food, man.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.115
You cannot be this
high maintenance, Marty.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.817
You are not pretty enough.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.853
They don't know
how pretty I am. Please.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.723
Oh, great, see, now that's
Mama calling.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.225
And she is worse than you are.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.459
Man, I ain't got time for this.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.828
I'm gonna just
finish this order.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.163
Hello? Yes, that
will be all, please.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.933
Oh, no, ooh,
ask if their lemon pie

12:46.033 --> 12:48.468
has more whipped
cream or meringue.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.205
I'm so sorry.
The call dropped.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.107
I just saw you hang up.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.443
That's why it dropped.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.949
Okay, well, please call me
back when you get this, Malcolm.

13:02.049 --> 13:05.085
I mean, them mountain
lions is getting close.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.854
Look, babe, that's
the Johnsons' house.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.121
No.
What?

13:08.221 --> 13:10.223
Uh, the Black Johnsons.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.926
I can tell because they leave

13:13.026 --> 13:14.594
their Christmas lights
up all year long.

13:14.694 --> 13:18.165
Mm. I kind of like it.
It keeps me in the spirit.

13:18.265 --> 13:22.269
It's March. There should
not be a Santa on that roof.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.239
Somebody's getting hangry.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.076
Dave, I don't know
what the hell that means,

13:29.176 --> 13:30.177
but I am not in the mood.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.246
I am hungry and I'm angry.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.749
I'm starving, too.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.685
You know what?

13:38.785 --> 13:40.787
Some of those boxes
you threw out were sealed.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.490
I'm getting some Triscuits. Ooh.
What?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.392
Will you see if there's
anything sweet in there?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.760
Like a...
Like a scone or an éclair?

13:47.895 --> 13:50.097
David, I'm going to the trash.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.132
I'm not popping by the bakery.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.475
Something knocked
over our trash cans.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.378
Oh, no. The raccoon is back.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.080
Oh, no, this was way
bigger than a raccoon.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.250
Oh, my God.
It's the mountain lion.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.352
Before we all die,

14:12.452 --> 14:14.922
I just want to make
it clear that,

14:14.922 --> 14:17.224
Dave, this is
all your fault!
That's right.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.161
How so?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.030
Because your composting

14:23.130 --> 14:25.365
attracted the raccoons,
which made Tina

14:25.465 --> 14:29.169
throw out our food,
which drew the mountain lion

14:29.269 --> 14:30.737
right to our front door.
Mm-hmm.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.539
I should've let
that man beat your ass.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.541
You should've.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.110
I can't leave our son alone.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.346
I don't care what's out there.
I'm going to be with my son.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.948
All right, honey. Wait.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.428
What were they saying?

14:55.528 --> 14:57.430
Whatever it was,
it translates to

14:57.530 --> 14:59.432
"Get your butt back
in the house, woman."

15:01.634 --> 15:03.870
Look, Grover's alone.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.439
He must be so scared.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.742
Okay.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.811
Now let's find out

15:11.979 --> 15:14.881
why I'm not allowed
to watch <i>Euphoria.</i>

15:24.791 --> 15:25.858
Yo...

15:25.993 --> 15:28.295
What is with
all the helicopters?

15:28.395 --> 15:29.997
It's got to be a police chase.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.999
I hope it's still on TV.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.902
I hope it's not us.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.041
Yo.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.742
Look at all this trash.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.878
Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna have
to clean all this up.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.247
Not it.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.349
Hold on, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.284
Are you really going
to be that juvenile?

15:52.719 --> 15:53.620
Yes.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.621
No!

15:54.721 --> 15:55.755
Malcolm!

15:56.356 --> 15:58.025
Hey, hey. I got the food.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.492
Are you crazy?

15:59.592 --> 16:01.661
Why didn't you answer
the phone when I called you?

16:01.761 --> 16:03.463
There's a mountain lion
loose out there.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.265
Out where?
I didn't get an alert.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.701
Oh, it's not just me. Yes.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.204
Where's your brother?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.539
He's out there cleaning
up the garbage.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.407
Oh, my God. Calvin,
go get my baby.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.408
I'm on it.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.443
I'll go with you, Pop.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.910
Oh, no, you won't. Uh-uh.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.112
You could get killed.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.148
I'll go.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.282
Yeah, go ahead, Dave.
Go, go.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.617
Go!

16:25.752 --> 16:27.154
Daddy!

16:27.254 --> 16:28.721
Don't let me go out like this!

16:28.821 --> 16:30.723
Oh.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.961
I've never been to Japan.
I've never whitewater rafted.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.697
There's two or three more
<i>Avatars</i> coming out.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.967
Well, what do you do
with a mountain lion?

16:41.068 --> 16:43.236
I think you're supposed
to punch it in the nose.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.371
That's a shark.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.306
Okay. All right.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.141
Uh, stay perfectly still.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.776
That's a T. rex.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.544
Well, I'm hearing
a lot of noes.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.979
Why don't you
throw out some ideas?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.147
Okay, okay.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.915
Marty, what you got in the bag?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.651
It's a Carolina
pulled pork sandwich.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.887
Bread on the side,
sauce on the side.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.091
You are your mama's son.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.159
All right, you know what?

17:06.259 --> 17:08.961
I got this. Okay? Come on.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.199
All right, everybody
just stay still.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.000
Hey, big cat.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.969
Hey there, Mr. Lion.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.472
How you doing?
You want some barbecue?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.943
Whoa!
Mama. Okay.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.979
N-Nice smile.
Nice smile. I like it. Okay.

17:27.114 --> 17:30.417
All right. It's good barbecue.
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.719
Okay... You eat meat, right?

17:32.819 --> 17:36.356
You're not one of those
vegan L.A. lions, are you?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.125
Go! Get in there!

17:38.125 --> 17:39.792
We haven't tried this
particular place,

17:39.892 --> 17:41.694
but it did get
four stars on Yelp.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.964
It's a mountain lion,
not a food critic.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.134
Okay.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.704
Go, go, go!
Shut the door, go shut it!

17:51.804 --> 17:53.140
Go shut the door!

17:53.140 --> 17:54.541
Whoo!
Oh!

17:54.641 --> 17:56.042
Whew.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.677
We got him!

17:57.777 --> 18:00.847
Don't mess with the dynamic duo.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.349
Duo?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.817
Dave, I went face to face
with a mountain lion.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.686
All you did was shut the door.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.390
Oh, my God, Daddy.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.858
You saved my life.

18:11.958 --> 18:15.695
You guys are my Blackman
and Robin.

18:18.064 --> 18:21.768
If the TV news comes by,
you got to say that.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.172
Which one am I?

18:30.177 --> 18:31.911
...where the mountain
lion was sedated

18:32.011 --> 18:34.481
and will be released
back into the wild.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.882
Coming up after the break,

18:35.982 --> 18:40.187
a 100-year-old woman dies
in a skydiving accident.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.857
And there you go,
little bro.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.759
Oh.
Now, just so you know,

18:46.859 --> 18:48.395
uh, I wanted to
come out there

18:48.495 --> 18:49.729
and save you,
but, uh, you know,

18:49.829 --> 18:51.298
Mama wouldn't let me.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.099
Aw. It's okay, Malcolm.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.302
Sometimes fear immobilizes you.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.607
I said Mama wouldn't let me.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.876
It's okay to be afraid
of lions, big brother.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.378
I still look up to you.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.384
Grover, don't you
want any food?

19:11.484 --> 19:14.053
Thanks, Mom, but...

19:15.855 --> 19:17.490
I'm good.

19:17.590 --> 19:21.228
Poor kid must
have been worried sick. Aw.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.464
Look, I know today
has been crazy, and...

19:24.564 --> 19:25.798
we didn't get a chance to talk

19:25.898 --> 19:27.500
about the whole
school musical thing.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.036
Oh, it's fine. Today reminded
me of what's really important.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.005
Don't worry about casting
that Brockwell kid.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.608
You're in charge.
You cast whoever you want.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.009
Oh, thank you.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.711
But I totally
understand, you know,

19:38.811 --> 19:40.247
you're under
a lot of pressure,

19:40.247 --> 19:42.682
so I will put Cooper
in the musical.

19:42.782 --> 19:46.453
He can be townsperson
number two.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.854
Townsperson number two?

19:47.954 --> 19:49.822
His only line is,
"Here comes Shrek."

19:49.922 --> 19:52.024
But it's your call.

19:54.261 --> 19:57.029
Hey, Dave. I know I'm
hard on you sometimes, but

19:57.129 --> 19:59.165
you really stepped up
out there today.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.600
Thanks for having my back.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.303
That's what best friends
are for. And you know what?

20:03.403 --> 20:06.439
I am going to share
some of the fruits

20:06.539 --> 20:07.907
of my composting with you.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.342
Grew these in my garden.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.110
