00:54.721 --> 00:57.588
Frylick, you got that gamebox working yet
or what? Come on.

00:57.657 --> 00:59.852
This is not a gamebox, Shake.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.653
- Well, I'm bored.
- Just go rent a DVD.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.629
I don't want to rent. I want to own.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.358
Then go get a job.

01:08.334 --> 01:11.098
Well, Dracula called
and he's coming tonight.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.264
Good. Then he'll be the one
to turn the knob...

01:13.339 --> 01:15.705
to power the world's
first hyperspeed super computer.

01:15.775 --> 01:18.972
He doesn't know how. I'm turning it.
I'm trained. Where is it?

01:19.045 --> 01:21.673
You want entertainment?
Just try to imagine a world...

01:21.748 --> 01:24.683
where e-mails are sent by your brain
before they are written...

01:24.751 --> 01:27.845
and are read before they arrive
by people you've never even met...

01:27.921 --> 01:30.389
in countries you've never even heard of.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.789
Now imagine a world...

01:32.859 --> 01:35.953
where all disease can be cured
with one digital...

01:36.429 --> 01:39.193
Shake! I told you to wait
until I tell you to do it!

01:39.265 --> 01:41.392
- Dracula did it.
- What was that?

01:41.468 --> 01:44.062
- What are you doing in the shower?
- Bathing.

01:44.204 --> 01:47.264
What do you mean, you gotta count?
There's over $200 in there.

01:47.474 --> 01:51.535
Okay, Candy, I'm sorry.
I guess we're not in America.

01:52.011 --> 01:55.879
I guess now I'm not allowed to pay
for sex with pennies.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.447
<i>Damn, Carl.</i>

02:00.520 --> 02:03.887
<i>I thought you knew
hoes will be hoes, brother.</i>

02:04.023 --> 02:07.288
All right. There.
We'll try this one more time.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.259
- Hey, is that a knob?
- Get away from that!

02:09.329 --> 02:11.524
- No, turn it.
- It is a knob. I'm gonna turn it.

02:11.598 --> 02:13.691
- You should turn it.
- Will everybody shut up?

02:13.766 --> 02:15.199
That's how it works.

02:15.268 --> 02:17.259
I'm gonna do the knob, okay?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.802
Now imagine, if you will, a world...

02:19.873 --> 02:22.364
Yeah, imagine a world
without your boredom.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.933
Now, will you turn it on
before the pizza shows up?

02:25.011 --> 02:27.309
This tape is starting to hurt my skin.

02:28.681 --> 02:31.912
Gentlemen, the OoGhlJ MIQtxxXA!

02:32.952 --> 02:35.682
Frylock, come on.
You really gonna call it that?

02:35.755 --> 02:39.623
Yeah. That's the Klingon word
for "superior galactic intelligence".

02:39.692 --> 02:41.159
And that's what this is.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.923
Superior galactic grandma
after eating a block of cheese...

02:43.997 --> 02:46.795
smoking three packs of cigarettes,
and drinking a quart of milk.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.333
Disgusting. That's the word.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.665
Well, I invented it,
and I can call it what I want.

02:50.737 --> 02:53.900
Fine. Good luck with the casual sex.

02:53.973 --> 02:57.238
I mean it. Because you won't get it,
not with that name.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.471
Anyway, go on. I'm sorry to interrupt.

02:59.979 --> 03:02.072
Meatwad, what do you think?

03:02.248 --> 03:04.273
- My butt itches.
- All right, fine!

03:04.350 --> 03:06.682
- What should I call it then?
- Badass Mother.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.620
No. Snoopy or Schroeder.
One of them two.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.125
No. Badass Mother 4000.
Twice as fast as your ass.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.182
- Yeah, baby!
- Snoopy.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.820
How about we all just shut up
and I turn it on?

03:16.963 --> 03:20.262
Gentlemen, say goodbye
to your old desktop.

03:23.169 --> 03:24.864
Say goodbye to your new one, too.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.498
- Where is it? What happened?
- Is it supposed to do that?

03:27.574 --> 03:29.906
- Did it bust through the wall again?
- Yes, it did.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.706
- No, it didn't.
- Dude, what did it do?

03:33.580 --> 03:35.548
Where do I go to do the poop?

03:35.615 --> 03:37.879
Then how did it just disappear, unless...

03:37.951 --> 03:39.418
Oh, snap! It didn't!

04:00.573 --> 04:02.632
To transmit data
from human nerve endings...

04:02.709 --> 04:05.542
I suspended the ramina collodial fluid
so it won't overheat...

04:05.612 --> 04:07.705
when the hard drives spun
at the speed of time.

04:07.780 --> 04:11.011
Because you're a witch. You made it
disappear with your evil magic!

04:11.084 --> 04:12.210
- He's a witch?
- Yeah!

04:12.285 --> 04:14.150
- I'm not a witch.
- Don't look at him wrong.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.586
He'll shrink your head to a pea's size.
I've seen it.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.591
The hard drive spun so fast,
it sent the computer back in time.

04:19.659 --> 04:23.095
To the time of witches,
where you once lived!

04:23.196 --> 04:27.360
Bring forth the stakes.
You shall burn for your beliefs, witch!

04:28.067 --> 04:30.558
My pizza's here. Pizza time!

04:33.439 --> 04:36.101
It's all starting to add up now, isn't it?

04:36.342 --> 04:37.866
The levitation.

04:38.177 --> 04:40.202
The evil book reading.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.343
Them cream cookies you're always eating.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.174
You're a damn witch.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.845
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do about it?

04:48.054 --> 04:49.783
Eat pizza. Pizza time!

04:50.456 --> 04:52.890
Okay. No, thank you.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.393
We don't have any money here. Thank you.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.656
So I'd appreciate it
if you dragged your crap...

04:57.730 --> 04:59.129
My computer!

04:59.432 --> 05:01.195
Thank you. That's nice.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.529
Don't give the guy money...

05:02.602 --> 05:04.832
or we're gonna be
the hobo hangout over here.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.804
Hello. Me Oog.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.333
Did you go to Vietnam, Oog?

05:09.442 --> 05:12.673
Hang on. Let me shed some tears
for your fake plastic toes.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.713
- Leave the room now.
- I will.

05:14.781 --> 05:18.080
And I won't be here
when he tells you how sick his family is...

05:18.151 --> 05:21.018
and that's why
he has to inhale all the Freon...

05:21.087 --> 05:24.113
Man, thank God you found my computer.
Where did you find it?

05:24.190 --> 05:27.057
Right here, 300 million years ago.

05:27.126 --> 05:29.890
This way back
before Oog's spine straightened...

05:29.962 --> 05:32.954
front lobes developed,
comprehend rational thought...

05:33.032 --> 05:35.626
master English language.

05:35.702 --> 05:39.069
Meatwad, your dad's here.
He wants to make amends.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.766
So, there me was,
beating boulder into powder...

05:41.841 --> 05:45.470
<i>because me couldn't eat it,
and magic ball land in lap.</i>

05:45.545 --> 05:47.911
<i>Naturally, me think, "All right! Free egg".</i>

05:47.980 --> 05:50.471
<i>Because me stupid and me caveman.</i>

05:50.550 --> 05:53.383
<i>So me spent about three days humping...</i>

05:53.453 --> 05:56.911
and bust open with thigh bone,
so me could eat it good.

05:57.156 --> 06:01.286
<i>Then magic ball shoot Oog with beam,
and next thing me know...</i>

06:01.361 --> 06:05.127
<i>me go out and invent wheel
out of dinosaur brain.</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:08.599
<i>Magic dino wheel rolls
for three short distance, until me eat it.</i>

06:08.668 --> 06:10.829
<i>The point is, me get smarter.</i>

06:10.903 --> 06:12.564
<i>Soon me walk upright.</i>

06:12.638 --> 06:16.301
<i>Me feather-back dirty, matted hair
into wings for style...</i>

06:16.609 --> 06:18.873
<i>and me stopped to use bathroom...</i>

06:18.945 --> 06:22.108
<i>as opposed to me just doing it as me walk.</i>

06:22.215 --> 06:25.514
That whole disease-free thing
was just a marketing tool.

06:25.585 --> 06:28.383
Honestly, it's just something
I thought up to sell the thing.

06:28.454 --> 06:31.787
How do you think me live this long,
and me so smart from knowledge?

06:31.858 --> 06:32.950
A good diet?

06:33.025 --> 06:36.461
Me told you Oog spent half time
eating dinosaur brains.

06:36.529 --> 06:37.621
Me no like brains.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.426
Oog, that is an amazing story.

06:39.499 --> 06:43.026
And I cannot thank you enough, man,
for bringing back my second prototype.

06:43.102 --> 06:45.536
- Now, if you'll just excuse me...
- Me no bring back.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.039
- Me think it miss something.
- What?

06:48.107 --> 06:51.372
Kick-ass fighting games
with action missiles.

06:51.444 --> 06:54.902
I get it. So you can sublimate
your primal hunting instincts...

06:54.981 --> 06:56.676
in a safe, civilized environment.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.444
No, me bored. Bored!

07:00.353 --> 07:02.150
Oog, all right, please.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.620
It's okay!

07:04.357 --> 07:06.154
- That ain't my daddy.
- Yes, it is.

07:06.225 --> 07:09.888
I asked him, "Are you Meatwad's daddy?"
He said, "How'd you know? Yes, I am".

07:12.198 --> 07:15.224
- All right, please. Just set the TV down.
- Bored!

07:15.301 --> 07:18.532
- Here, look. Keys. Jingle keys.
- Bored!

07:25.011 --> 07:27.980
Hello? Oog? You okay, man?

07:29.649 --> 07:32.311
Me get crazy when me no have cigarette.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.478
Me try to quit, but me find it hard.

07:34.554 --> 07:36.681
Me love refreshing taste.

07:37.089 --> 07:39.489
- You sure you don't mind?
- No, of course.

07:39.559 --> 07:40.651
Fire!

07:41.727 --> 07:44.594
Please! Okay, look.
Keys. Here are the keys.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.760
Magic keys make Oog all better.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.937
- Shake, will you come in here, please?
- Do I have to touch him?

07:54.006 --> 07:56.372
Come here and jingle these keys
while I talk to him.

07:56.442 --> 08:00.037
I know how to do it. Don't talk down to me
in front of your friends.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.945
I have friends, too,
and they're coming over later.

08:03.549 --> 08:06.040
Oog, I don't want to come down
too hard on you...

08:06.118 --> 08:09.383
We're gonna watch loud TV shows, too,
me and my friends.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.487
I'm jingling. Damn, I'm doing it.

08:12.792 --> 08:16.125
Oog, this ball, as you call it, is mine.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.390
I created it, and I kind of need it back now.

08:18.464 --> 08:19.988
You no understand.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.694
Magic ball make Oog feel good.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.531
Help Oog live long time.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.504
Watch out, Daddy. He's a witch.

08:26.572 --> 08:29.507
Red Fryman want Oog to die.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.071
Damn it!

08:32.178 --> 08:35.443
I suppose I could hook you up
with a few games.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.676
- Games good.
- Games very good.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.986
Here you go.
The ultimate action fighting game.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.645
"Soltar".

08:43.722 --> 08:45.588
No. "Solitaire".

08:45.758 --> 08:47.783
Look at the Jack. See the Jack there?

08:47.860 --> 08:50.192
When you do something good,
he winks at you.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.994
He look dumb with curly mustache.

08:53.165 --> 08:54.154
Bored.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.432
Wait. Chill out.

08:56.502 --> 08:59.767
Look. He shoots missiles, too.
See? He's a warrior.

09:02.909 --> 09:05.207
- Then me like better.
- Give him Clam Digger.

09:05.311 --> 09:09.270
- I don't think Clam Digger is...
- Clam Digger. Give Oog Clam Digger.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.077
You gonna love this, boy.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.880
Tyrone calls you up in the game
and he says:

09:13.953 --> 09:17.946
"I can dig more clams than you, stupid".
And you gotta say, "No, boy".

09:18.024 --> 09:21.516
And y'all got to race down to the beach
with your buckets and shovels.

09:21.594 --> 09:24.893
And the object of the game
is to find parking.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.666
- No Clam Digger.
- But this is a hard game.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.067
And games convert into package...

09:32.138 --> 09:35.005
play over Internet, small subscription fee?

09:35.207 --> 09:37.607
Well, sure. I suppose it could.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.907
Give to Oog! Mine! Me crazy!

09:39.979 --> 09:41.537
Me rip Oog head off!

09:42.949 --> 09:46.214
- See you later, Daddy.
- Magic ball mine! Oog head rip!

09:46.285 --> 09:48.048
Don't rip your head off.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.180
You need that for breathing and stuff.

09:52.391 --> 09:54.518
Goodbyes are so difficult sometimes.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.459
<i>One, two, one, two</i>

10:01.534 --> 10:03.365
Hey, look, y'all. Daddy's on TV.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.996
<i>That's right, dude.
Send e-mails from your brain.</i>

10:06.072 --> 10:09.098
<i>And now it's got hot new games,
like the Legend of Zoltar.</i>

10:09.175 --> 10:12.872
<i>Plus it cures all diseases, dude.
I kicked my zits to the curb.</i>

10:14.280 --> 10:16.111
<i>Dude, you're getting an OoGhlJ MIQtxxXA.</i>

10:16.182 --> 10:18.912
<i>You buy. Make Oog rich. Rip head off!</i>

10:21.687 --> 10:25.817
Man, now that I have seen that on TV,
that is the shizz-nite!

10:25.891 --> 10:29.349
Apparently, since this guy has been
around for about 300 million years...

10:29.428 --> 10:30.918
he kind of beat me to the patent.

10:30.997 --> 10:34.125
Well, you made that other one.
Your dead one. We'll play with it.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.930
- I don't know where it went.
- Yeah, good luck finding it.

10:37.003 --> 10:40.803
It shot a hole through my roof.
Guess what it bounced off of?

10:41.540 --> 10:43.508
I gotta go. And he did it.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.976
Look, I know that you're staring...

10:47.780 --> 10:51.682
I gotta drain it three times a day
so my brain can think good.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.013
We're hoping that's temporary.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.646
You didn't happen to see
which way it went, did you?

10:56.989 --> 10:58.820
"A" is for apple, "J" is for jacks.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.483
Look, Err, free egg.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.754
Damn, yeah! For straight! For shizm!

11:02.828 --> 11:05.695
- Try having omelets now, Denver.
- Omeletoids.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.064
Did you hear what I said, Denver,
or shall I turn it up for you?

11:28.854 --> 11:29.843
