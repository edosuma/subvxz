00:02.160 --> 00:04.083
My name was Oliver Queen.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.442
For three years I worked to save my city...

00:07.000 --> 00:10.049
...but to save my sister,
I had to become someone else.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.730
I had to become something else.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.605
Previously on Arrow:

00:16.760 --> 00:21.243
Roy's alive. We faked his death.
He's starting a new life.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.447
- John.
- Oliver?

00:22.600 --> 00:27.527
Bring Nyssa to the warehouse at Fullerton
and Halsted and I'll let your wife go.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.445
- There's no way of getting him back.
- He's gone, Felicity.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.649
There's only one thing left of him now. Us.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.284
- Do you recognize this?
- The Alpha and Omega bio-weapon.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.410
You'll unleash this on Starling City.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.961
His fever is getting worse.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.928
Maseo? A pharmacy.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.088
The Romans called it vastatio.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.165
The systemic destruction of a land
to ensure its subjugation.

01:18.360 --> 01:23.685
And what they found was that immolation
left a blank slate to build anew.

01:24.360 --> 01:28.763
Until you have destroyed your home
and severed all ties from your old life...

01:28.920 --> 01:31.082
...can you begin anew?

01:31.240 --> 01:36.121
I did not foresee the day that
Maseo Yamashiro appeared at my door.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.529
You had the courage to demand
an audience of me.

01:39.680 --> 01:44.288
And those who do usually offer money
and treasure in exchange for my favor.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.682
But you gave me the Alpha and Omega.

01:51.200 --> 01:57.048
The plane is en route. It will be ready
tomorrow, as you've commanded.

02:02.040 --> 02:06.250
You will marry my daughter
and you will ascend to Ra's al Ghul...

02:06.400 --> 02:10.848
...and then you will fly to Starling City
carrying death itself.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.090
I hate when they run.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.006
Well, at least you're getting
your cardio workout in.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.562
I still have 40 minutes on an elliptical
in my immediate future.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.967
You supposed to be undercover
or something?

02:44.920 --> 02:46.604
I sniffed you three blocks back.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.082
And you led me right to your gang.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.083
- Smart plan.
- Thanks.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.322
No, I meant smart plan...

02:54.240 --> 02:55.605
...because it was mine.

03:22.080 --> 03:27.086
John, I think he gives up. John. John!

03:34.640 --> 03:36.483
Thanks for coming in through the back.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.849
With Sara and Lyla gone, the last
thing I need are neighbors talking.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.810
About some strange woman
dressed in all-black leather. Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.322
You're out of ice. How
can you be out of ice?

03:46.480 --> 03:47.641
- Here.
- Thanks.

03:48.440 --> 03:52.161
Okay, so the night's young and there's
a meth dealer working a corner on Fulton.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.163
- Sounds good.
- Actually, it doesn't.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.366
You were completely unhinged
out there tonight, Dig.

03:58.520 --> 04:02.650
- You're in denial about how angry you are.
- No, Felicity, I'm not in denial.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.086
But I am angry.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.526
Oliver.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.287
He was my best friend...

04:18.160 --> 04:19.969
...and he kidnapped...

04:21.320 --> 04:23.129
...my wife.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.527
You think that justifies
hospitalizing people?

04:26.040 --> 04:29.203
No, Felicity. It doesn't. You're right.
It won't happen again.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.203
I'm not saying that life doesn't suck...

04:31.360 --> 04:34.011
...but you can't take it out
on every criminal you see.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.209
How can you, out of all people,
be so sanguine after what happened?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.567
- I know that wasn't Oliver.
- Who's in denial?

04:39.720 --> 04:44.521
It wasn't. Our Oliver, my Oliver,
died the day he joined the League.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.530
- This is someone else.
- You truly believe that?

04:50.720 --> 04:51.881
I have to.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.327
Don't try to talk me out of going.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.608
Mr. Harper went through a lot of trouble
to fake his death.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.565
- You know he can never come back here.
- Yeah, well, maybe I'm just going to go there.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.882
- Permanently?
- Look, I don't know.

05:16.080 --> 05:21.405
Honestly, I don't know anything anymore.
I barely know who I am.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.767
Thea, it's understandable.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.720
You've been through something
very few people have ever experienced.

05:27.880 --> 05:31.851
- Of course you feel...
- Is that what you think this is all about?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.243
Almost dying?
Because I'd rather have died...

05:35.400 --> 05:38.085
...than have my brother
sacrifice his life for mine.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.444
And don't think for a second
that I forgot the whole reason...

05:41.600 --> 05:45.605
...Ra's al Ghul was brought into our lives
is because of you.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.442
You're no longer in danger from the League.

05:48.840 --> 05:53.289
Maybe getting away from Starling City
for a while is what's best for you.

05:53.440 --> 05:59.607
You approve? Is that supposed to worry me?
Because it actually kind of does.

06:00.080 --> 06:06.247
But look, the only thing I know right now
is that I need to go be with Roy.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.847
My daughter.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.281
I am not hungry.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.967
Yes. Many a bride has skipped
a meal or two before their wedding day.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.407
I would rather die than wed this pretender.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.486
You speak as though they are the only
two options before you, my daughter.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.122
Daughter? And to think
I once wore that title with pride.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.928
Perhaps "mother" will suit you better.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.522
After your betrothal to Al Sah-him...

06:36.680 --> 06:39.001
...you will extend my lineage
by having a child.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.721
- If you think I will bear his child...
- Yes! I do.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.290
And you will have no more say in it
than your mother was given.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.802
You're quiet.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.770
I'm prepared for my ascension to Ra's.

06:59.640 --> 07:04.009
I'm still coming to grips with marriage.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.367
Perhaps a walk to clear my head.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.522
I'll send a guard to accompany you.

07:08.680 --> 07:13.208
If I can't protect myself,
I don't deserve to inherit your mantle.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.410
You're late.

07:30.280 --> 07:34.330
Sorry. Nanda Parbat's not exactly
the easiest place to infiltrate.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.209
Don't joke.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.362
Things are worse than we thought.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.881
Tomorrow?

07:47.040 --> 07:49.725
Ra's plans to transport the virus
to Starling on a plane.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.929
That's oddly modern for the League.
Do you think Ra's suspects you?

07:53.080 --> 07:56.368
- He has no reason to.
- I warned you it would be difficult.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.170
I just thought that I'd... Ahem.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.049
We'd have more time.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.685
When you explained to me
that my ascension to Ra's...

08:03.840 --> 08:09.404
...would include the destruction of Starling...
I anticipated you wouldn't be Ra's for months.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.767
More than enough time
to dismantle the League.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.844
Malcolm, we need help.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.722
From all accounts, you were too good
at convincing your friends...

08:20.880 --> 08:25.841
...that you'd allied yourself with Ra's and I
don't think I carry much credibility with them.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.923
I know someone who they'll trust.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.169
You've been gone a while.
There was concern.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.687
I've just been here thinking.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.044
- We need to find ibuprofen.
- You know that can't help him now.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.441
Why isn't the inoculant working on him?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.649
He's young. His immune system
probably isn't strong enough.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.931
Akio, swallow.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.128
General Shrieve.

09:37.280 --> 09:42.730
Maseo. I want to kill Shrieve too,
but you need to focus on helping Akio.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.963
Shrieve's men made a vaccine.
Maybe they also made a cure.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.647
- No, Maseo, they didn't make...
- I know it's unlikely, but I have to try.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.009
Okay. I'll help you.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.201
Hi, I'm looking for Jason?

10:09.360 --> 10:12.170
Oh, yeah? Well, lucky him.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.891
Yo, Jason. You got a visitor.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.121
Jason?

10:22.760 --> 10:23.807
That's right.

10:23.960 --> 10:28.329
I have a '67 Mustang
that needs a little work on it.

10:28.520 --> 10:32.161
- Somebody said you were the guy to see.
- You came to the right place.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.726
I can't believe you're still alive.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.724
I wanted to tell you.
But if you knew, you'd tell Oliver.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.770
- And then Oliver would've...
- Would've broken you out of prison.

10:44.920 --> 10:48.845
And probably kicked your ass.
And I would have helped him.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.725
I had to do it. For Oliver.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.651
You think maybe there's some other place
we could go talk?

10:55.400 --> 10:56.890
There's my place.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.404
That's such a good answer.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.447
- Hey.
- You got it to fly. What more do you want?

11:15.600 --> 11:22.290
True art is never finished, it's only abandoned.
Plus, I had this little idea I just couldn't kick.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.570
Are you okay? You have this little cloud
that keeps following you around.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.611
Yeah. Something happened
while you were away.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.565
I'm just handling it.

11:32.720 --> 11:38.807
Is it, uh, Oliver-related? It's Oliver-related.
If you want to talk about it...

11:38.960 --> 11:42.009
Maybe we shouldn't cross that line.
It's a long story anyway.

11:42.160 --> 11:47.610
Well, if you change your mind, I have time.
And, hey, you're my friend.

11:47.760 --> 11:51.526
I'm always going to be there for you.
It's non-negotiable.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.205
Thanks, Ray.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.647
So while I'm waiting
to do something for you...

11:57.800 --> 12:01.043
...there's a little something
that you can do for me.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.331
Sign here and here.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.130
Okay.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.725
- What's this for?
- Just a little corporate stuff, Ms. Vice President.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.291
Mm-hm.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.845
Everything okay?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.090
Probably not.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.401
- You've been quiet.
- I have a lot on my mind.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.605
I meant about the virus. The Alpha Omega.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.771
When did you take it?

12:39.080 --> 12:42.163
From the truck, before we blew it up.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.369
So before...

12:46.520 --> 12:51.686
Even before Akio died, I wanted revenge
on Shrieve for the pain he caused.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.003
But instead, you used it
to trade your way into the League.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.242
I am not strong.

12:58.440 --> 13:02.047
Not enough for myself
and certainty not enough for Tatsu.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.886
- If you could go back to her, would you?
- It is immaterial.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.767
- Maseo Yamashiro is no more.
- He doesn't have to be.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.163
When I'm Ra's,
I can release you from your oath.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.564
I can set you free.

13:16.720 --> 13:20.042
The League is not my prison.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.762
From my prison...

13:24.680 --> 13:26.364
...there is no escape.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.243
So now Malcolm Merlyn can summon us.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.688
I really don't like the idea
that he can summon us.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.251
Any idea what this is about?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.085
No, but Merlyn assures me
he'll be waving the white flag.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.567
- I'm sorry, I forgot the flag.
- That's too bad.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.764
I would have told you
where you could put it.

13:44.920 --> 13:48.720
- What is this about, Malcolm?
- This won't be easy for all of you to believe...

13:48.880 --> 13:50.405
You're a sociopath and a liar.

13:50.560 --> 13:54.042
Be that as it may, this will be
much quicker for all of us...

13:54.200 --> 13:56.567
...if we could fast-forward
through the cynicism...

13:56.720 --> 13:58.768
...and realize that I am telling the truth.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.127
- About what?
- Oliver.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.887
His allegiance with the
League is a charade.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.963
Why would you even play
with our emotions?

14:07.120 --> 14:11.489
This plan was born the moment Oliver realized
that he had to capitulate to Ra's to save Thea.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.122
And instead of sharing this plan with us,
he trusted you.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.767
The man who had my sister murdered.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.247
I am better practiced in
the art of deception...

14:20.400 --> 14:22.971
...and, no offense,
none of you are good actors.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.451
I'm out.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.843
You've seen for yourselves how dangerous
Ra's and the League are.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.688
- The circle of trust had to be small as possible.
- Until now? What changed?

14:32.840 --> 14:35.764
Forget it. There's nothing he could say
that we could believe.

14:35.920 --> 14:41.211
Mr. Diggle's right. Which is why
I brought along a friend of Oliver's.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.403
My name is Tatsu Yamashiro.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.611
And your city is in great danger.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.130
You expect us to believe her?
We never even met her.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.850
- We never met her, right?
- No.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.049
Apart from my brief time helping Oliver
recover from the wounds...

15:09.200 --> 15:15.003
...Ra's al Ghul inflicted on him,
my life has been one of isolation.

15:15.160 --> 15:19.529
Okay, Merlyn. This is your big plan?
A woman we've never met or even heard of?

15:19.680 --> 15:21.489
Oliver doesn't speak about the past.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.802
He's not forthcoming
about the present, either.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.726
My son was killed by the virus
Ra's intends to use on your city.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.411
- You're Akio's mother.
- Oliver was with me when it happened.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.083
He knows that the danger
you all face is very real.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.847
Okay, how many times are we gonna believe
him after everything that he's done?

15:40.040 --> 15:45.524
I am not privy to your history with
Malcolm. This request comes from Oliver.

15:45.680 --> 15:51.722
- We're not sure that's any better at the moment.
- Look, I am not playing a game here.

15:51.880 --> 15:56.044
My daughter lives in this city, remember?
This is everything I have on the bio-weapon.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.567
I've arranged for all of us
to go to Nanda Parbat.

15:58.720 --> 16:03.726
If you're coming,
be at Ferris Air before sunrise.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.211
Come.

16:11.880 --> 16:16.249
- Charming.
- It's a sublet. I won't be here for much longer.

16:16.400 --> 16:20.121
- What about the auto shop?
- It's temporary.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.248
Sure, they don't ask a lot of questions...

16:22.400 --> 16:25.290
...but it's inevitable someone
puts two and two together.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.528
How about your other night job?

16:27.680 --> 16:32.242
I figure I'd just leave the crime-fighting to
the cops. I kind of just want to be normal.

16:32.800 --> 16:37.089
- Yeah, and how's that going for you?
- I am so bored.

16:37.240 --> 16:44.089
- Ha, ha.
- Heh. Yeah, well, that's why I brought you this.

16:46.760 --> 16:51.607
Malcolm stole it out of impound. Don't worry,
I made him promise nobody would get killed.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.649
I never thought I'd see this thing again.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.441
I figured since everybody thinks
that Roy Harper's the Arrow...

16:57.600 --> 17:00.604
...they don't have to know
that he's Arsenal too, right?

17:01.320 --> 17:05.608
So that's why you came here?
Just to give me this?

17:05.760 --> 17:07.762
Well, yes.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.487
This, and...

17:37.480 --> 17:39.209
How could we not know about this?

17:39.360 --> 17:41.931
Not know about a terrorist attack
in Hong Kong?

17:42.120 --> 17:45.329
Beijing had us believing these deaths
were caused by a chemical spill.

17:45.480 --> 17:49.041
- You don't really believe Merlyn.
- Looking at this, we can't afford not to.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.841
He is a murderer who has lied so many
times, it should be a drinking game.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.002
And I've never even heard of this Tatsu.

17:55.160 --> 17:58.482
Felicity, I don't know if you're right
that Oliver's gone forever or not.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.728
The truth is, for me it doesn't matter.

18:00.880 --> 18:05.010
If there's even a possibility of this kind of
danger in my city, I'm reporting for duty.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.807
- Me too.
- I don't believe them.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.369
And even if I did, I can't go back there.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.726
Not after what they did to Oliver.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.003
- Relax, my child.
- Another order I cannot follow.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.568
You speak to me as though I'm a monster.
I am your father, Nyssa.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.371
Then why do you ask me to marry someone
I do not love?

18:31.520 --> 18:37.209
When I was in Odessa, tending to some
affairs, I crossed paths with a woman.

18:37.920 --> 18:43.370
She was breathtaking
in both visage and fortitude.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.720
Her name was Ameena Raatko.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.769
I had taken other lovers before...

18:50.920 --> 18:52.684
...but she was different.

18:52.840 --> 18:58.404
She had a wit and a fire about her that I
found myself I could not live without.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.441
So she became my concubine
and the mother of my child.

19:12.440 --> 19:18.243
This was my gift to her in honor of you,
the gift that she gave me.

19:18.400 --> 19:23.088
And so I kept it in the hopes that one day
you would wear it on your wedding day.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.248
You expect me to marry Al Sah-him
because of some trinket?

19:29.880 --> 19:34.044
I expect you to marry Al Sah-him
because it is my will.

19:34.200 --> 19:39.331
You defy that and I will see you
suffer the pain of a thousand deaths.

19:55.280 --> 20:00.684
I am sorry to intrude.
Mr. Merlyn said that I would find you here.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.966
That might be the only thing
he's ever said that isn't a lie.

20:05.640 --> 20:09.122
I did not come here to convince you
of the threat to your home.

20:09.280 --> 20:14.810
There is nothing I can say that you will
believe, more than what you have seen.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.647
Then why are you here?

20:18.920 --> 20:21.651
To speak with you about Oliver.

20:22.320 --> 20:26.484
During his recuperation,
Oliver spoke of you.

20:27.800 --> 20:33.330
Of how his last thought
before the fall was of you.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.051
You love him, still.

20:37.240 --> 20:42.007
- Oliver belongs to Ra's now.
- If you believe that, you must fight for him.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.766
There is no him left.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.121
I thought as you do once.

20:48.280 --> 20:54.322
My husband, Maseo,
was consumed by the League's darkness.

20:54.880 --> 21:00.330
I was so convinced that he was lost to me
that I didn't even try to reach him.

21:02.160 --> 21:06.210
Don't make my mistake, Felicity.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.009
Are you sure Shrieve will be here?

21:16.160 --> 21:18.640
Know of any other rogue
U.S. Army bases in the area?

21:18.800 --> 21:22.646
Shrieve will have reinforced this station
since the last time we were here.

21:30.320 --> 21:35.042
Two there. Waller took you from Lian Yu
because she saw something in you.

21:36.080 --> 21:41.007
My son needs that from you.
The killer inside.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.285
Sir, this is a restricted area.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.682
- Is that a Masamune blade?
- A katana.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.089
Passed down for centuries within my family.

22:03.240 --> 22:07.131
- The first son of each generation.
- You are not a son, Tatsu.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.609
No, I am not.

22:11.760 --> 22:12.966
Let's get this over with.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.761
The plane's ready. It should be big enough
for all of us. Including her.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.884
- Thought you weren't coming.
- I changed my mind.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.249
If you betray us, I'll make sure
the whole world knows you are alive.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.408
And where they can find you.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.330
So this is Nanda Parbat.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.324
Next time we should really look
into getting some horses.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.404
- You think they rent horses here?
- There won't be a next time.

22:53.880 --> 22:59.489
There it is. The plane Ra's intends to use
to spread the Alpha Omega over Starling.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.286
I need to be within 5O yards
to breach the plane's...

23:02.480 --> 23:04.642
...navigation software
to be able to ground it.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.326
- Quiet.
- I don't see anything.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.490
There'll be more.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.528
Get to the plane. We'll cover you. Go!

23:40.680 --> 23:41.966
Close enough.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.240
Surrender now and you might live.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.880
- Maseo.
- Maseo is a memory.

24:17.440 --> 24:21.729
Our child was gone and you left me
when I needed you most.

24:21.880 --> 24:25.089
But you can still come back to me.
It's not too late.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.086
Yes, it is.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.881
- I wouldn't have done the same thing for you.
- I know.

24:47.760 --> 24:53.642
Your husband is long dead.
If Sarab must die as well, then so be it.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.405
Frak. More frak.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.409
Oh, that makes more sense.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.610
- Can you bring it down from the sky?
- They destroyed my gear.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.604
- I had some insurance come along.
- What kind of insurance?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.366
The atomic kind.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.965
Ray!

26:01.640 --> 26:03.165
Get down!

26:06.880 --> 26:08.644
Ray-

26:10.320 --> 26:12.641
You should see the other guy.

26:31.880 --> 26:35.168
Tell Akio I love him.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.522
You tell him for both of us.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.843
Thank you...

26:56.760 --> 26:59.206
...for releasing me...

27:00.560 --> 27:01.766
...from my prison.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.290
Enough!

27:36.280 --> 27:38.248
You have failed.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.722
Any further attempt to undermine
our cause would be futile.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.928
Uh, you see that burning plane there?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.606
We destroyed
your city-threatening bio-weapon.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.125
No.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.925
You merely think you did.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.811
Surrender...

27:57.240 --> 27:59.004
...or die.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.769
Hey, Oliver. Oliver, what's going on?

28:11.960 --> 28:14.440
If any of you speak, we're all gonna die.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.728
- What?
- I need you to trust me.

28:24.040 --> 28:30.286
Stir the grass and you startle the snake.

28:30.760 --> 28:35.049
My ruse with the plane was meant to reveal
any traitors among me.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.762
How did you know of the virus?

28:40.360 --> 28:42.328
Of the plane?

28:49.600 --> 28:52.763
Maseo told me. And I told them.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.161
So a dead man told you?

28:56.280 --> 28:57.770
How convenient.

28:57.960 --> 29:04.844
He said only three men knew about
your plan. You, him, and Oliver.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.368
Oliver Queen is dead. I am Al Sah-him.

29:08.520 --> 29:11.569
This would not be the first time
that Sarab has betrayed me...

29:11.720 --> 29:13.688
...to Maseo Yamashiro's weaknesses.

29:13.840 --> 29:18.641
And though your timing was a function of
my gambit, it was nevertheless fortuitous.

29:18.800 --> 29:23.089
You see, by tradition, the Ra's would
contemplate mercy upon his enemies...

29:23.640 --> 29:25.722
...on the eve of a wedding.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.482
You are getting married? I guess there
really is a kettle for every pot.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.525
The wedding is mine.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.969
I am betrothed to Nyssa al Ghul.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.885
Take them below.

30:06.400 --> 30:10.291
- So can you tell me now?
- Tell you what?

30:10.440 --> 30:14.206
- What you're really doing here.
- Seeing you is not good enough?

30:14.360 --> 30:15.566
What's going on?

30:20.640 --> 30:22.688
Something happened.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.969
I was hurt.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.081
And to save me...

30:28.240 --> 30:33.610
...Ollie had to accept Ra's' offer
to join the League.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.650
Oh, my God. Thea...

30:36.800 --> 30:38.564
I tried to stop him.

30:38.720 --> 30:44.602
I couldn't,
and now he's become someone else.

30:45.160 --> 30:48.323
Everything just is a lot easier
when I'm with you.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.289
I understand that.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.487
But?

30:53.720 --> 30:57.645
When bad things happen,
your go-to move is to bolt.

30:57.800 --> 31:03.011
To get out of Starling. I don't think
this is something you can run away from.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.606
I'm not running away.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.645
I'm running to you.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.329
You don't want me to?

31:12.480 --> 31:16.007
The only thing that I want
is what's best for you.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.127
You always have.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.001
Come here.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.321
I can't believe he's gonna marry her.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.643
You should worry more about
getting out of here alive.

31:37.160 --> 31:40.209
Is that even a remote possibility?

31:41.000 --> 31:44.322
- Didn't think so.
- We aren't gonna die here.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.290
- Oliver would never let that happen.
- He let this happen.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.448
Wah-reeth al Ghul commands your presence.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.684
Leave us.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.009
- Is everyone okay?
- Like you give a damn.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.889
- Didn't Malcolm speak to you?
- He did.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.930
You plan to leave my daughter alone
when you kidnapped my wife?

32:31.080 --> 32:33.526
I had to do something
to prove my loyalty to Ra's.

32:33.720 --> 32:37.406
So taking Lyla, that was your idea, Oliver?
In front of our daughter?

32:37.600 --> 32:40.331
Yes. You met Tatsu.

32:40.520 --> 32:45.242
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Tatsu told me that in order to beat Ra's...

32:45.440 --> 32:50.526
...I would have to sacrifice all of the
things in my life that I hold most precious.

32:50.680 --> 32:55.004
- And your friendship was on that list.
- Oliver, you didn't just lose my friendship.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.410
You lost my trust. You lost my respect.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.607
What?

33:01.800 --> 33:04.371
Ra's demands that we return
this man to his friends.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.402
I repeat, two assailants... Aah!

33:15.360 --> 33:16.850
Johansson's down.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.331
I have visuals.

33:27.080 --> 33:30.289
- Give us the cure.
- You boys make quite the entrance.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.482
The cure. Now.

33:34.560 --> 33:39.646
The Chinese own enough of our national debt
to decimate our economy...

33:39.800 --> 33:41.404
...all without firing a shot.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.970
Or they could destroy us
with the largest army in human history.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.326
Enough!

33:47.480 --> 33:50.962
- My son needs your cure.
- What makes you think...?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.570
The next one goes in your head.

33:55.920 --> 34:00.482
You see that safe over there?
The passcode is 4-5-8-7.

34:02.880 --> 34:07.966
You'll have to deliver the cure subcutaneously,
in the exact ratio I give you.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.360
- You may want to write this down.
- You don't need to tell us.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.324
You're coming with us.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.480
This is so beautiful...

34:24.320 --> 34:26.766
...and yet so dangerous.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.206
Much like its former owner.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.846
Sarab's former love.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.324
Who is now my prisoner,
along with Al Sah-him's former friends.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.802
You see, their treachery was anticipated.

34:42.960 --> 34:46.168
Yours, however, Al Sa-her,
is disappointing...

34:46.320 --> 34:50.484
...because I expected more loyalty
from a man whose daughter I saved.

34:50.639 --> 34:55.362
The last time I appeared before you
in chains, I offered my fealty.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.841
And I am here to offer it again.

34:59.360 --> 35:03.001
You had nothing to offer then
and you have nothing to offer now.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.647
I have the name of the person
who betrayed you to Al Sah-him's friends.

35:06.800 --> 35:11.442
It wasn't Maseo Yamashiro,
it was Oliver Queen.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.729
Heh. He's been lying to you all along.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.882
- What's this?
- I'm sorry, Oliver.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.725
- My name is Al Sah-him.
- Not according to Mr. Merlyn here.

35:28.880 --> 35:32.930
You see, he claims that you've been
deceiving me the entire time.

35:33.680 --> 35:37.401
I have killed for you.
I have severed all ties to my past.

35:37.560 --> 35:40.689
I have hurt people
who were friends to Oliver Queen.

35:40.840 --> 35:44.049
And if you hadn't stopped me,
I would have murdered your daughter.

35:44.240 --> 35:47.562
What if this is all just part
of your own elaborate ruse?

35:47.720 --> 35:51.202
Then I will have nothing
and no one to go home to.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.928
Oliver Queen is dead and the Arrow is gone.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.246
We shall see.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.243
Roy?

36:20.880 --> 36:24.362
- Excuse me, I'm looking for...
- Jason's friend. Yeah, I remember.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.522
He said you'd probably be stopping by.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.968
- Oh. Can I talk to him?
- I don't know where he is.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.846
He came in an hour ago to quit.
He, uh, said to give you this.

36:39.120 --> 36:42.090
"Dear Thea,
I wasn't supposed to make it this far.

36:42.240 --> 36:45.050
I was supposed to end up in jail
or dead by now.

36:45.200 --> 36:49.842
But then I met you, and you made me
want to be the man I saw through your eyes.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.367
And now all I want to
do is give that back...

36:52.560 --> 36:55.211
...help you be the person
you can be without Oliver...

36:55.360 --> 36:58.170
...without your father and without me.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.762
Living on the run from the police
isn't the life you deserve, Thea.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.844
It's not what Oliver gave up his life
for you to have.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.971
Whatever happens with me,
I will always love you.

37:09.720 --> 37:15.762
PS, thanks for the suit, but I always
thought red was more your color anyway."

37:27.960 --> 37:30.327
What did Oliver say to you?

37:32.160 --> 37:33.525
Nothing worth hearing.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.763
You were right about Oliver.
I should have listened to you.

37:43.360 --> 37:47.809
- I told you about Oliver. You were supposed to...
- I was supposed to do what, Mr. Merlyn?

37:47.960 --> 37:51.328
Grant you mercy? I am.

37:51.480 --> 37:55.041
Because this death will be a lot shorter
than the one I had planned for you.

37:59.480 --> 38:03.883
Oliver, if what Malcolm said is true, if
you're going to do anything, now is the time.

38:04.040 --> 38:07.522
Al Sah-him has said that
the swordswoman is inoculated...

38:07.720 --> 38:10.644
...so you can take her to another chamber.

38:11.720 --> 38:15.441
No. Oliver. Oliver, we believed in you.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.570
Seal the room.

38:20.640 --> 38:23.803
Oliver, listen to me. Oliver!

38:24.880 --> 38:27.167
- For the love of God.
- No, Oliver.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.690
- What the hell are you doing?
- You've got to get us out of here.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.730
We trusted you. You asked us to trust you
and we trusted you.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.723
- Don't do this. Oliver!
- Oliver!

38:35.880 --> 38:37.882
Oliver, don't do this!

38:41.320 --> 38:42.845
Tatsu.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.170
There's a cure
and he knows how to administer it.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.689
A little help.

38:57.680 --> 39:02.129
He's not breathing.
The cure, he needs it now!

39:10.080 --> 39:12.526
Akio, please wake up.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.207
Please wake up.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.129
He was dead the moment he was exposed.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.851
- But you said...
- There is no cure.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.408
- Then what the hell is that?
- Insulin.

39:24.560 --> 39:25.800
I'm diabetic.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.526
Ah.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.440
I want to thank you for bringing me here.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.849
It would have taken us weeks
to track you all down.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.482
And I do so hate loose ends.

39:55.880 --> 40:00.010
You are Wah-reeth al Ghul,
heir to the Demon.

40:00.160 --> 40:06.202
Before the night is over,
you will be lbn al Ghul, son of the Demon.

40:38.800 --> 40:43.328
There is no vow more sacred,
nor covenant more holy...

40:43.480 --> 40:45.687
...than the one between man and woman.

40:47.480 --> 40:51.690
With this ceremony, your souls
are bound together. Forever joined.

40:52.640 --> 40:58.283
You will never be free. You will always be
held captive by your love for each other.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.087
- Continue.
- I'm sorry, Felicity. For everything.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.564
You don't have to be sorry
for anything, John.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.085
And for this shared life...

41:15.280 --> 41:16.850
I'm glad to have known you.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.490
...we offer blessings.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.369
Bara-ka t.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.770
The union is sealed.
