you downloaded from the array.

- Yes.

Mr. Data, perhaps
you had better reexamine the array.

it is more than that.

that things did happen
as you remember them.

And when
did this relationship begin?

25:10.383 --> 25:12.635
It is my understanding
your romantic affiliation began

25:12.844 --> 25:14.887
shortly after you recovered
from your spinal injury

25:15.096 --> 25:17.389

for his formal permission

25:21.228 --> 25:22.686

would be dishonorable.

And then we mated.

I am not privy to the exact details

of when, where or how
your first coupling took place.

25:33.823 --> 25:37.535
- I could investigate it.
- No, no, that is all right.

25:39.579 --> 25:42.957
I am detecting no temporal anomalies
in this system.

to pinpoint the exact moment

- I was in Sickbay.

I had a concussion,

that happening.

25:57.639 --> 25:58.973

that was the very first change?

26:02.978 --> 26:04.687

26:06.731 --> 26:09.900
Yes. Yes, I was in Engineering.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.611
I felt a wave of dizziness,
and when I looked up,

26:12.821 --> 26:16.615
you and Commander La Forge
were on the opposite side of the room.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.450
And Captain Picard was gone.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.202
I thought I had blacked out
for a moment

26:20.412 --> 26:23.289
and had not observed
your movements.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.625
And at my birthday party,

26:26.835 --> 26:30.212
the cake was chocolate
and then it was yellow.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.589
And Commander Riker told me

26:31.798 --> 26:33.841
Captain Picard
was not going to attend,

26:34.050 --> 26:35.634
and then suddenly, he was there.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.720
Hmm.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.764
We should try to find
the commonalities in these events.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.475
Who were the people
you were with?

26:43.685 --> 26:46.478
Everyone was at my birthday party.

26:46.688 --> 26:51.817
Then I was with Counselor Troi.
Then Commander La Forge came in.

26:52.944 --> 26:53.986
Geordi.

26:54.195 --> 26:57.448
Geordi was present
at all three locations.

26:57.657 --> 27:01.869
And he was near me in each case
just before I noticed the differences.

27:02.495 --> 27:05.998
- There has to be a connection.
- It is possible.

27:06.207 --> 27:09.168
We should speak
to Commander La Forge.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.046

27:12.255 --> 27:15.132
Is Geordi well enough
to answer a few questions?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.303
Geordi's dead.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.233
There do not appear
to be any unusual readings.

from the plasma burns.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.077
I see nothing
that connects these bioreadings

27:43.286 --> 27:46.580
to your recent sense of discontinuity.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.082
What about his VISOR?

27:54.756 --> 27:59.218
I still see nothing unusual.
Perhaps we should activate it.

27:59.427 --> 28:02.262
Hook it up to the diagnostic array
and I'll check it out.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.566
The VISOR is active.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.569
Worf, are you all right?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.324
Have you noticed
another discontinuity?

28:24.786 --> 28:26.662
Dr. Crusher was not here.

28:27.080 --> 28:30.666
- Dr. Ogawa was.
- Dr. Ogawa?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.545
And my uniform has changed.

28:34.754 --> 28:39.550
- What is my rank and position?
- You're a commander and first officer.

28:40.593 --> 28:44.388
- Are we still married?
- Yes.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.642
I am detecting a quantum flux
in your cellular RNA.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.310
What does that mean?

28:50.520 --> 28:55.023
I do not know.
I will have to analyze these readings.

29:00.822 --> 29:04.450
I have found that the quantum flux
in Worf's cellular RNA

29:04.659 --> 29:06.785
extends to the subatomic level.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.747
It is asynchronous
with normal matter.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.457
In essence, captain,

29:11.666 --> 29:13.876
Mr. Worf does not belong
in our universe.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.127
What?

29:15.336 --> 29:18.255
All matter in the universe
resonates on a quantum level

29:18.465 --> 29:20.007
with a unique signature.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.800
That signature is constant.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.803
It cannot be changed
through any known process.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.389
It is the basic foundation
of existence.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.725
Are you saying
that Worf's quantum signature

29:29.934 --> 29:31.518
is different from ours?

29:31.728 --> 29:34.062
Yes, sir. I cannot explain it.

29:34.272 --> 29:38.025
It is as if he originates
from a different quantum universe.

29:38.234 --> 29:41.779
Mr. Worf, you say the discontinuities
started to occur after you returned

29:41.988 --> 29:44.156
from a bat'leth tournament
on Forcas IlI.

29:44.365 --> 29:45.407
Yes, sir.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.826
I know for a fact that
you never attended that tournament

29:48.036 --> 29:50.412
and that no shuttlecraft
has left the Enterprise for a month.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.039
I understand that,

29:52.248 --> 29:54.541
but I also clearly remember
attending the tournament

29:54.751 --> 29:56.794
and returning to the ship
in a shuttlecraft.

29:57.003 --> 29:58.796
Do you remember the route
you took to return?

29:59.005 --> 30:00.047
Yes.

30:00.256 --> 30:01.381
Let's backtrack that course,

30:01.591 --> 30:03.425
see if there are unusual readings
or anomalies.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.968

Aye, sir.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.600
If I may inquire, sir,

30:11.810 --> 30:14.186
how long have you been captain
of the Enterprise?

30:14.687 --> 30:16.480
Four years.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.651
Ever since Captain Picard was killed
in the incident with the Borg.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.155
You don't remember any of this,
do you?

30:28.159 --> 30:32.120
I do remember.
I just remember it differently.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.340
Captain, l'm picking up
a minor subspace disturbance

30:43.550 --> 30:44.591
off the port bow.

30:44.801 --> 30:45.843

MAN: Aye, sir.

30:46.052 --> 30:47.219
Analysis, Mr. Data.

30:47.428 --> 30:51.014
It appears to be a quantum fissure
in the space-time continuum.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.600
On-screen.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.019
The anomaly cannot be seen,

30:56.229 --> 31:00.190
but I believe I can enhance it
with a warp field to make it visible.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.820

DATA: Not from this distance, sir.

31:05.029 --> 31:08.949

intersecting the phenomenon.

31:09.158 --> 31:13.370
I believe it was left
by a Starfleet type-6 shuttlecraft.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.122
So I was here.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.167
I have an explanation, sir.

31:19.794 --> 31:22.254
I believe the quantum fissure
we discovered

31:22.463 --> 31:25.924
is a fixed point
across the space-time continuum,

31:26.134 --> 31:29.636
a keyhole which intersects
many other quantum realities.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.722
What do you mean,
"quantum realities"?

31:31.931 --> 31:32.973
For any event,

31:33.182 --> 31:35.434
there is an infinite number
of possible outcomes.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.353
Our choices determine
which outcomes will follow.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.231
But there is a theory
in quantum physics

31:41.441 --> 31:44.943
that all possibilities that can happen
do happen

31:45.153 --> 31:47.279
in alternate quantum realities.

31:47.488 --> 31:51.783
And somehow I have been shifting
from one reality to another.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.703
- That is correct.
- How did this happen?

31:57.206 --> 31:59.124
When Worf's shuttlecraft
came into contact

31:59.334 --> 32:00.792
with the quantum fissure,

32:01.002 --> 32:03.170
I believe its warp engines
caused a small break

32:03.379 --> 32:05.923
in the barriers
between quantum realities.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.800
Worf was thrown into a state
of quantum flux.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.970
He immediately shifted
into other realities.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.140
And Geordi's VISOR
somehow triggered that effect.

32:15.350 --> 32:19.144
Exactly.
The VISOR uses a subspace field pulse.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.647
I believe that whenever Geordi
came near Worf,

32:21.856 --> 32:24.608
the field pulse
intensified the quantum flux

32:24.817 --> 32:27.319
and pushed Worf
into another reality.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.655
Well, how can we find
my original quantum state

32:29.864 --> 32:30.906
and return me to it?

32:31.115 --> 32:35.744
We could scan the quantum fissure
using a subspace differential pulse.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.621
Maybe we could find
the quantum state

32:37.830 --> 32:41.166
that shares Worf's signature
and find a way to get him back.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.627
An excellent idea, lieutenant.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.312
Worf,

33:03.690 --> 33:06.066
from what l understand,

33:06.275 --> 33:10.278
there's a good chance
my Worf won't return.

33:11.489 --> 33:14.741
I guess it's just hard for me
to accept

33:14.951 --> 33:20.372
that there's a reality out there
where you never loved me.

33:23.126 --> 33:28.505
Deanna, I have always considered you
a close friend.

33:30.008 --> 33:35.387
And although I have never seriously
considered a romantic relationship,

33:36.597 --> 33:39.474
I would not be opposed
to the possibility.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.060
What about our children?

33:44.147 --> 33:46.648
- Children?
- You didn't know?

33:48.901 --> 33:51.903
When the last shift occurred
in Sickbay,

33:52.113 --> 33:53.989
we did not have any children.

33:59.787 --> 34:03.582
We have a little girl, Shannara.
She's 2 years old.

34:03.791 --> 34:08.170
And a 3-year-old boy,
Eric-Christopher.

34:13.092 --> 34:17.137
- What about Alexander?
- Alexander?

34:21.601 --> 34:24.936
He was my son in another reality.

34:41.788 --> 34:42.954
I've used a differential pulse

34:43.164 --> 34:44.873
to analyze
over 1 0 million quantum states

34:45.083 --> 34:46.124
within the fissure,

34:46.334 --> 34:48.627
but I still haven't found one
with your signature.

34:48.836 --> 34:51.213
This may take some time, sir.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.757
Captain,
a Bajoran ship is approaching.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.092
RlKER:
Red alert.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.094
WORF:
The Bajorans?

34:57.303 --> 34:59.554
Ever since the Bajorans
overpowered the Cardassian Empire,

34:59.764 --> 35:01.306
they've become
more and more aggressive.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.850
Yesterday they destroyed
one of our subspace telescopes

35:04.060 --> 35:06.812
because they thought we were using it
to spy against them.

35:07.021 --> 35:10.357
- They're charging their weapons, sir.
- Shields.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.275
Return fire.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.653
They've damaged
our power system, sir.

35:14.862 --> 35:17.155
It's caused an energy surge
within the subspace pulse.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.741
The quantum fissure
is beginning to destabilize.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.953
Can we disengage the pulse?

35:24.497 --> 35:26.373
Too late, sir.

35:32.004 --> 35:33.296
What the hell is happening?

35:33.506 --> 35:36.133
The barriers between quantum realities
are breaking down.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.678
Other realities are emerging
into our own.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.445
The Bajoran ship is disengaging, sir.

35:57.655 --> 36:01.116
The rate of quantum incursions
is increasing exponentially.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.952
At this rate, the sector will be
completely filled with Enterprises

36:04.162 --> 36:05.370
within three days.

36:05.580 --> 36:09.833
Captain,
we're receiving 285,000 hails.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.335
I wish I knew what to tell them.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.881
Mr. Data,
can we stop these incursions?

36:16.090 --> 36:18.300
Perhaps, if we can find the ship

36:18.509 --> 36:21.052
that matches Commander Worf's
quantum signature.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.596
How would that help?

36:22.805 --> 36:25.891
It was Worf's shuttlecraft
which traversed the fissure

36:26.100 --> 36:28.685
and weakened the barriers
between quantum realities.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.521
If he reenters the fissure
in his original shuttle

36:31.731 --> 36:35.650
and emits a broad-spectrum warp field,
it may be enough to seal the fissure

36:35.860 --> 36:38.153
and stop additional realities
from entering our own.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.613
What then?

36:39.822 --> 36:41.823
How do we get the Enterprises
that are already here

36:42.033 --> 36:43.074
back to where they belong?

36:43.284 --> 36:46.119
In theory,
the act of sealing the fissure

36:46.329 --> 36:48.788
should restore the barriers
between quantum states.

36:48.998 --> 36:52.000
The ships would return
to their own realities.

36:53.669 --> 36:58.423
Lieutenant Crusher,
send a general hail, all ships.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.258
ENSlGN:
Aye, sir.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.347
This is Captain Riker
of the Enterprise.

37:05.806 --> 37:09.935
That is, the Enterprise
that is indigenous to this universe.

37:10.144 --> 37:12.437
We have all encountered
a quantum anomaly.

37:12.647 --> 37:16.233
We think we have found a way
to return us all to our proper realities,

37:16.442 --> 37:18.026
but we need to find that ship

37:18.236 --> 37:21.071
which exhibits
a certain quantum signature.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.908
Our Mr. Data will transmit
that signature to you now.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.043
- Anything?
- There's too much com traffic, sir.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.380
It's tough to isolate
who's talking to who.

37:38.589 --> 37:42.634
Wait a minute. Here it is.
Someone's responding.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.928
On-screen.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.640
Captain, it would appear that we have
found the quantum signature

37:48.849 --> 37:49.891
you were looking for.

37:50.101 --> 37:54.145
Data believes that by sending Worf
back through the fissure again,

37:54.355 --> 37:56.564
it would return us all
to our proper realities.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.650
Our Data has said the same thing.

37:58.859 --> 38:01.903
We need you
to send us your shuttlecraft Curie.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.823
- We're launching it now.
- Thank you.

38:05.866 --> 38:09.619
It's good to see you again, captain.
It's been a long time.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.629
RlKER: Did they send the right shuttle?
DATA: Yes, sir.

38:19.839 --> 38:23.466
It matches Commander Worf's
quantum signature precisely.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.343
I have remodulated
the shuttle's engines

38:25.553 --> 38:27.554
to emit an inverse warp field.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.180
You will need to activate that field

38:29.390 --> 38:31.099
at the precise moment
you enter the fissure.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.394
WORF: Assuming it works,
will I find myself near my own ship?

38:34.603 --> 38:36.438
That is one possibility.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.023
However, the uncertainty principle

38:38.232 --> 38:41.693
dictates that time is a variable
in this equation.

38:41.902 --> 38:44.070
You may end up
several days before the event

38:44.280 --> 38:45.655
or several days after.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.115
There is no way to tell.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.493
- I understand.
- Good luck.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.876
Setting course for the fissure.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.836
RlKER [OVER lNTERCOM :
Acknowledged.

39:42.588 --> 39:45.256
Captain,
the shuttlecraft is under attack.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.508
The Bajorans again.

39:46.717 --> 39:50.595
No, sir, it's one of the Enterprises.
They're hailing us.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.015
On-screen.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.643
We won't go back.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.686
You don't know what it's like
in our universe.

39:58.896 --> 40:02.524
The Federation's gone.
The Borg is everywhere.

40:03.484 --> 40:07.153
We're one of the last ships left.
Please, you've got to help us.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.280
I'm sorry, there's no choice.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.574
If this works,
everything will return to--

40:11.784 --> 40:16.121
- No, we won't go back.
- Sir, they're firing on the shuttlecraft.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.331
Open fire. Try to disable them.

40:21.168 --> 40:24.337
Direct hit.
Their shields have collapsed.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.964
Their engine core is overloading.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.261
What happened?

40:31.470 --> 40:34.264
It looks like the ship
had already taken heavy damage.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.599
Their warp containment field
must have been weak.

40:36.809 --> 40:41.062
- Probably from fighting with the Borg.
- Captain, Worf is entering the fissure.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.526
Charging primary systems.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.822
Initiating inverse warp field.

41:25.900 --> 41:26.983
Worf to Enterprise.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.444
PICARD [OVER INTERCOM]:
Enterprise here.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.988
Captain, is everything all right?

41:32.198 --> 41:35.116
PICARD:
Yes, lieutenant. ls there a problem?

41:36.202 --> 41:40.538
No, I do not believe so,
but I will explain when I arrive.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.374
PICARD:
How was the bat'leth tournament?

41:45.669 --> 41:47.378
WORF:
It was fine, sir.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.675
I won champion standing.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.310
So you think this quantum fissure is
nothing that we need to worry about?

42:02.520 --> 42:05.563
No, no, l believe
the inverse warp field resealed it.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.358
I'm looking forward
to reading your report.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.451
Something wrong?

42:18.661 --> 42:22.622
I know what you are planning, sir.
I will not be surprised.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.999
Surprised?
I don't know what you're talking about.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.085
Of course you don't.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.814
- Welcome home, Worf.
- Aah!

42:48.023 --> 42:50.942
I hope you don't mind. l let myself in.

42:51.151 --> 42:53.778
I promised Alexander
I'd feed his Dalvin hissing beetle

42:53.988 --> 42:55.822
while you were both away.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.659
So you do not live here?

43:00.828 --> 43:02.370
What's that supposed to mean?

43:04.373 --> 43:06.124
It is a long story.

43:10.671 --> 43:13.423
Happy birthday, Worf.

43:13.632 --> 43:15.383
Will wanted to give you
a surprise party,

43:15.593 --> 43:19.345
but I knew you'd hate it,
so I talked him out of it.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.014
Thank you.

43:21.223 --> 43:24.809
I know Klingons like to be alone
on their birthdays.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.686
You probably want to meditate

43:26.895 --> 43:29.480
or hit yourself with a painstik
or something.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.816
Deanna.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.236
You do not have to leave.

43:35.696 --> 43:36.738
Oh?

43:37.823 --> 43:42.660
I have not had dinner.
Would you care to join me?

43:44.288 --> 43:45.496
I'd love to.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.392
Champagne.
