WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:07.641
Previously on Hightown...

00:07.675 --> 00:09.310
Because it was an injury crash,

00:09.343 --> 00:11.011
- they could charge you with a
felony. - A felony?

00:11.045 --> 00:12.546
We got a hit on the
prints obtained.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.382
They match with
Emmanuel Delgado,

00:14.415 --> 00:16.484
AKA Osito, and he's working
for Frankie Cuevas.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.686
And we're looking at him
for the Sherry Henry murder.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.287
Have you ever had
a serious relationship?

00:20.321 --> 00:21.622
One--Devonne.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.391
But we broke up,
and now she hates me.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.393
I need to know why Osito came
to see you last night.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.061
You think I'm telling Osito
that I'm talking to a cop?

00:27.094 --> 00:28.496
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.499
Go fuck yourself, Ray.
We're done.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.200
Text the guy,
tell him you're on the way.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.436
So what the fuck happened?
I thought you were the boat guy.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.171
It was a fucking supermoon, bro.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.739
- You know this girl?
- It's Krista Collins.

00:38.773 --> 00:40.241
Sherry's friend,
she was there.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.076
She was at Sherry's house
the day of the murder.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.210
I know something's up, man.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.478
All right, look,
why don't you come onboard

00:44.512 --> 00:45.780
and we'll talk about it?
Watch your step.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.585
Fuck.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.287
Bitch only weighs,
like, one bill.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.156
All right, come on,
just pick it up.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.732
- You got this?
- Whoa.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.567
Wait.
Wait, where you going?

02:47.701 --> 02:48.836
Yo, you're the boat guy.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.660
It started as partying,

03:46.694 --> 03:48.662
but then that needle...

03:48.696 --> 03:51.799
fucking Nirvana, bro.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.568
You beg, borrow, and steal
for another piece of it.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.274
But what is it?
What's that Nirvana we're all
chasing?

04:02.810 --> 04:06.780
Just to look in the mirror...

04:06.814 --> 04:08.349
and not fucking hate yourself.

04:10.618 --> 04:14.321
But I don't hate myself,
and I'm not chasing anything.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.457
Yeah, except a body that
has nothing to do with you.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.726
I found it.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.527
Yeah, but still,
you're obsessed with that shit.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.696
I'm not obsessing about it.
I just want to know what
happened.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.864
Okay, why?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.432
Because I'm on a mission.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.635
It's like fate
or whatever the fuck.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.802
Who gives a shit?

04:28.836 --> 04:31.472
I just know that
I'm supposed to do this.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.807
That's stupid.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.976
What do you mean "that's
stupid"? What do you know?

04:36.010 --> 04:39.680
You ever seen a body before?
That shit fucks with you.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.448
Yeah, Jackie, listen to me,
I get it, okay?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.484
But these are bad people
that would do that to a girl.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.419
Fucking kids up in Hyannis
are crazy.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.754
Oh, come on,
n-not like I'm scared

04:46.787 --> 04:48.589
of some white boys
from Hy-Town, no offense.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.625
No, you don't fucking get it.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.760
What's up with you?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.367
Nothing.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.704
It's nothing.
I just--I know about life.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.506
I used to do crazy shit.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.743
I fucking knew it.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.378
What?

05:13.047 --> 05:15.849
You really did suck a dick,
didn't you?

05:15.883 --> 05:17.484
Fuck off.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.585
God.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.529
Still want me to
be your sponsor?

05:30.397 --> 05:32.499
I mean, yeah.
Yeah, would you do that?

05:32.533 --> 05:35.602
Yeah,
but you got to take direction.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.705
From you?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.574
I'm just joking. Jesus.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.514
Listen, would you, um...

05:47.548 --> 05:49.450
Would you want to go
to court with me tomorrow?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.452
I'd rather stick a gun
in my mouth.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.921
Hit me up after.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.367
It's O.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.636
What's this about
a fucking moon?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.071
You may be straight
with Frankie,

06:11.105 --> 06:13.040
but you ain't straight with me.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.842
Give me a fucking call.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.685
It was a peek-a-
boo all afternoon.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.487
You see this?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.090
"Opioid overdoses

06:30.124 --> 06:32.726
"have skyrocketed
in the Boston area since 2018,

06:32.760 --> 06:36.697
with six deaths attributed to
the powerful fentanyl derivative
carfentanil."

06:36.730 --> 06:37.931
Ask me why I don't give a shit.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.901
Why don't you give a shit?

06:40.934 --> 06:44.138
Because we're the Cape Cod
Interagency Narcotics Unit.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.473
Boston is not on Cape Cod.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.777
Furthermore, there have been
zero carfentanil deaths on the
Cape.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.678
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
But you know it's coming.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.847
We should set up a task force
just for carfentanil.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.083
That's not gonna happen.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.751
I almost forgot.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.453
Best Buy Hyannis,

06:59.486 --> 07:01.989
our community partners
in the fight against crime,

07:02.022 --> 07:04.024
donated an iPad to the unit.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.692
- One iPad.
- Yeah.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.027
What are we supposed
to do with that?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.529
You're a cop.
Figure it out.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.997
Okay.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.433
Hey, where are you
on your white whale?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.769
Osito?
I'm about to pin down his
location.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.137
Are you talking
to Frankie's girl?

07:17.171 --> 07:18.705
- Uh, what's her name?
- Renee.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.440
- Renee.
- We talk all the time.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.176
I'm gonna text her
right now, okay?

08:05.752 --> 08:06.753
She's fine.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.827
Dad, we're kind of
in the middle of something.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.063
She shit herself.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.764
Yeah, okay.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.266
All right, I--
coming.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.703
This isn't gonna work, baby.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.572
We can't go to my place.
My parents hate you.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.676
You know, I was thinking
maybe we could...

08:29.710 --> 08:30.677
I don't know.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.678
What if we start looking
for our own place?

08:31.712 --> 08:33.113
I thought we were going slow.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.681
Yeah, I thought we were
gonna hit it.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.618
I want to, too.
That doesn't mean we should live
together.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.722
Can't afford a place
in P-Town anyway.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.926
Yeah, well, you let me
worry about that, okay?

08:52.633 --> 08:53.767
Junior!

09:05.812 --> 09:07.915
Nervous?

09:07.948 --> 09:11.618
Nah.
Just too much coffee.

09:11.652 --> 09:15.122
Well, when you get in there,
just try to act normal.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.259
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.762
- You talk to Hunniker again?
- Yeah.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.730
- And?
- I don't know, Jack.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.866
Depends on how this goes.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.935
Felony conviction will be tough
to come back from.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.170
Ah, there's your lawyer.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.939
- Him?
- Hey, Uncle Ed.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.073
Sorry, traffic sucked.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.743
You must be Miss Quinones.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.844
Phil Hancock.

09:37.878 --> 09:38.912
Hey.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.181
- Where's your suit?
- Where's yours?

09:41.214 --> 09:44.818
- It's not my arraignment.
- Who cares what she's fucking
wearing?

09:44.851 --> 09:46.186
When you go up,
they'll read you your charges,

09:46.219 --> 09:48.755
and I'll try and get it down
to a misdemeanor.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.692
Is that the police report?
Can I see it?

09:51.725 --> 09:53.126
If convicted of a felony,

09:53.160 --> 09:55.329
you could be sentenced
to at least six months in jail

09:55.362 --> 09:58.131
and a fine
in the 4,500 to 4,800 range.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.700
But if she's in the jail,

09:59.733 --> 10:00.968
the fine is kind of like,
"who gives a shit?"

10:01.001 --> 10:02.135
So, when the time comes,

10:02.169 --> 10:03.270
we either plead it
down to reckless

10:03.303 --> 10:04.771
or get a jury trial.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.741
And I recommend you stay away
from Miss Monty.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.310
She could be called
as a witness against you.

10:10.344 --> 10:13.947
Yeah, trust me.
I won't go anywhere near her.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.383
You sure you can get this
dropped down to a misdemeanor?

10:16.616 --> 10:20.721
Well, no promises,
but I feel fairly confident.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.055
Felony stands.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.658
Your Honor, my client checked
into treatment voluntarily.

10:24.691 --> 10:25.926
But checked out after nine days.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.027
She's also a federal agent.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.628
I know what her job is.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.664
She's lucky she's not facing
manslaughter charges.

10:30.697 --> 10:31.965
Miss Quinones,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.834
I'm suspending your license
pending trial.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.303
Let's set for September 30th.

10:44.111 --> 10:47.214
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.316
Patty...
I can't read your writing.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.322
"J-Jackie Quinoa... "

10:55.355 --> 10:56.990
something like that.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.960
"She called last night.
She said she had info on Sherry
Henry."

10:59.993 --> 11:02.429
- Take it.
- Why didn't I get this earlier?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.197
- You're getting it now.
- Thanks, Patty.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.266
Uh-huh.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.402
Fucking judge.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.070
Shake it off.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.738
You just got to make it
to September 30th.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.875
- Keep going to those meetings.
- Maybe if I had a real
lawyer...

11:14.908 --> 11:17.411
Hey, you want to hit Cliff Pond,
catch some trout?

11:17.444 --> 11:20.213
- In your chauffer car?
- No, I got the Caddy back.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.381
Oh, good for you, but, no.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.949
Well, at least
come by the house.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.251
Linda's worried about you.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.953
Uh, one sec.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.155
Hello?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.723
This is Sergeant Ray Abruzzo.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.324
I heard you have some
information regarding Sherry
Henry.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.193
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, hey.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.395
Can you talk today?

11:35.429 --> 11:38.098
Sure, yeah,
if you can come pick me up.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.201
Yeah, not a problem.
I'll send a patrol car.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.236
I'll text you,
and you send me your address.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.105
Yeah.
Cool, thanks.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.306
Great.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.908
Hey, something came up.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.409
But tell Linda I said hi.

11:49.443 --> 11:52.813
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, all good.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.817
You like dancing
for all those degenerates?

11:56.850 --> 11:58.051
You know I do.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.186
Throwing that pussy around?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.754
Yeah.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.823
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm such a fucking slut.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.228
But no one has
a cock like mine, right?

12:08.261 --> 12:09.863
Mm, fuck, no.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.031
- Right?
- Oh, fuck, no.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.835
Harder.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.103
Oh, harder.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.940
You fucking that cop?
Huh?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.108
Fucking Ray Abruzzo?

12:21.141 --> 12:22.976
No.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.479
Tell me what I want to hear.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.014
Yeah.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.816
- Yeah, I'm fucking him.
- Mm-hmm.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.485
- Oh, I'm fucking the shit...
- Yeah.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.853
Out of Ray Abruzzo.

12:32.886 --> 12:33.987
That's my girl.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.240
How is Frankie?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.241
He's good.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.375
We're doing sight words.

12:55.408 --> 13:00.380
So he can read "and," "it... "

13:00.413 --> 13:02.849
Uh, "she," all sorts of things.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.285
Is that good?

13:05.318 --> 13:06.386
I don't know.

13:18.899 --> 13:22.369
I was serious about the cop.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.505
You fucking him?

13:25.539 --> 13:27.040
No.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.276
Why not?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.880
I really have to answer that?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.215
He's a fucking prick.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.384
You see where I am.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.987
I can't do shit in here.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.060
If we're gonna get
through this...

13:47.093 --> 13:51.998
I need you to step up
and be resourceful.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.406
Look at me.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.354
Thanks for coming in, Jackie.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.523
Okay, so what do you know
about Sherry Henry?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.024
Right, yeah.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.360
So, um...

14:20.393 --> 14:22.495
so she's got this friend,
Krista Collins,

14:22.529 --> 14:25.398
and they-they wear
these matching necklaces.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.567
So, you know, they're tight,
whatever.

14:27.601 --> 14:30.904
And I'm pretty sure that
they were together the day
Sherry died.

14:30.937 --> 14:33.940
Okay, good.
How do you know this Krista
Collins?

14:33.974 --> 14:36.943
Well, I don't, like,
know her know her.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.880
But you talked to her.

14:40.914 --> 14:44.451
Not yet, no, I mean,
her-her phone's out of service.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.086
Okay, so I'm confused

14:46.119 --> 14:48.421
as to what your relationship is
with Miss Collins.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.390
I haven't actually met her,
but I do know

14:50.423 --> 14:52.259
that Sherry is Krista's
emergency contact

14:52.292 --> 14:53.593
and picked her up
from Glendon House

14:53.627 --> 14:55.061
on the day that she died.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.930
So now I can't find her,
and the people

14:56.963 --> 14:58.598
that she was staying with--
they lied about it.

14:58.632 --> 15:02.302
So I think if we find Krista,
we can solve Sherry's murder.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.307
How do you know that Sherry was
Krista's emergency contact?

15:07.340 --> 15:08.908
I saw her file.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.077
- Glendon House?
- Yeah.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.947
Yeah, so were you visiting,
or are you inpatient or
outpatient?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.083
Listen, I had a DUI, okay?
But what the fuck?

15:17.117 --> 15:18.251
It has nothing to do with this.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.619
What, was it a felony
or a misdemeanor?

15:19.653 --> 15:21.321
Jesus. You're not fucking
listening to me, man.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.657
- I think I'm listening.
- It's not about me.

15:23.690 --> 15:27.193
Krista Collins was with Sherry
Henry the day that she died.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.330
I mean, she could be a witness.
She might know something about
the case.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.931
She could be at the bottom
of the fucking ocean.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.633
Right, so you're thinking
like a serial killer situation.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.101
I'm not thinking anything.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.037
I am telling you
what I found out.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.242
I appreciate the effort,
but you're making a lot of
assumptions,

15:42.275 --> 15:44.344
and you don't have facts yet.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.979
This is an ongoing
investigation,

15:46.012 --> 15:47.647
and we have some
really good leads.

15:47.681 --> 15:50.617
So just know that we're working
towards an arrest right now.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.687
Well, good for you,
but Krista Collins is still
missing.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.455
Thank you.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.626
What do you mean?
That's it? What the fuck?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.561
I'm gonna try to relate to you
here for a second, okay?

16:01.594 --> 16:03.296
You found the body.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.698
I know that's traumatic,
and you feel like--

16:04.731 --> 16:07.200
Hey, man, don't patronize me,
all right?

16:10.036 --> 16:11.338
This is a homicide
investigation.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.006
You have to let us handle it.
Thank you.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.207
I'm in law enforcement.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.042
No...

16:16.076 --> 16:18.011
you're not.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.979
Mike, get her a cup of coffee
on the way out.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.114
You got it.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.216
Stay away from my case.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.589
- This way.
- Don't touch me.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.299
Yeah, it's me.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.735
Look, I need a BOLO
on a Krista Collins.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.739
Okay, try it with a fucking K.

16:50.276 --> 16:53.113
Ray, cell records
just came back.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.082
Body side found where Sherry was
killed-- industrial park in
Truro.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.083
Here you go, Al.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.118
Truro?

16:58.151 --> 16:59.352
Tell me that came
with witnesses

16:59.386 --> 17:00.387
and security cam footage.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.623
- That would be too easy.
- Right.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.729
No one's seen this guy.
No one talks about this guy.

17:09.763 --> 17:11.297
What is he, a fucking ghost?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.566
You asking me if Osito exists
on the astral plane?

17:13.600 --> 17:15.502
No, this guy eats
and shits somewhere.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.240
Yeah.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.741
How many Remy's on the Cape?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.378
No, I haven't seen this dude.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.479
All right, take a look again.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.282
I mean, you always remember
the fat ones

17:29.315 --> 17:31.518
because you feel sort of guilty.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.454
Give me my phone.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.457
You seen this guy?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.159
Yeah, he's been in here.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.060
Yeah? When?
Did he come in for breakfast?

17:41.094 --> 17:42.262
You mean does he
order breakfast,

17:42.295 --> 17:43.530
or does he come in the morning?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.698
'Cause we serve
breakfast all day.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.667
Does he come in the morning
and order breakfast?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.302
I don't know.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.336
I think he ordered a burger,

17:50.370 --> 17:52.405
and you can't get
that until 10:30.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.506
Does that help?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.208
No.
Ask your coworkers.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.277
Sir, it is busy.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.511
Oh, you dropped another fry.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.690
All right.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.325
No.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.693
Sorry.

18:13.726 --> 18:17.397
No one's seen him here in the
morning or for breakfast.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.099
Thank you, Sunshine.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.304
Yeah, he comes here
a few days a week.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.405
Fat-ass.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.507
All right.
Same time?

18:27.540 --> 18:31.411
Yeah, pretty early, gets, like,
four sausage, egg, and cheese.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.581
Sometimes I hold the cheese
just to fuck with him.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.684
So you gonna order something?

18:37.717 --> 18:39.719
Fuck, no.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.595
- What up, son?
- Yeah, what up?

18:50.897 --> 18:54.300
Look, I was thinking, you know,
maybe you could front me an
extra finger?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.271
Jesus!
What the fuck?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.573
Who do I look like,
the fucking Loan-A-Center?

19:00.607 --> 19:02.308
Yeah, okay, come on, man.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.577
You know, you'll get it back
next week, right?

19:04.611 --> 19:06.579
Talk to Osito?

19:06.613 --> 19:08.448
Yeah, could you please
just unroll your window?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.316
- He's been trying to holler at
you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.318
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I was with my girl, all right?

19:12.352 --> 19:13.620
Just unroll your fucking window!

19:13.653 --> 19:15.154
No.
No, no, no.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.756
- How hard is it...
- What the fuck? Fuck Stop.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.192
To make sure you hide a body
in the ocean?

19:19.225 --> 19:20.827
- It's the fucking ocean.
- Yeah, I know.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.462
I know.
I told Frankie already.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.730
It was a fucking supermoon.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.498
Don't tell me.
Tell Osito!

19:25.532 --> 19:27.534
I'll talk to him, all right?
Just unroll the fucking window!

19:27.567 --> 19:30.370
Please, I'll talk to him.
Fucking stop the car!

19:36.442 --> 19:38.778
I'm sorry, Kiz, all right?
I'm s--I'm s...

19:38.811 --> 19:41.781
I'm gonna fucking--
I'm gonna take care of it, all
right?

19:41.814 --> 19:43.883
I know you will.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.885
And here...

19:45.919 --> 19:48.388
Don't say I never did
nothing for you.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.424
Protect your neck, son.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.192
Punk-ass bitch.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.738
Yo, I need a ride.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.908
What's up?

20:08.942 --> 20:11.778
You told me to hit you up
after court.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.581
What--
Oh.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.983
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, how-how'd that go?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.551
Eh...

20:18.585 --> 20:20.687
Listen, any chance you can
take me to Barnstable?

20:20.720 --> 20:21.854
For what?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.423
You're not gonna like it.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.692
I got to go to Sherry Henry's
house, find out what they know.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.760
Jesus, Jackie.
How many times do I have to say
it?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.963
Listen, either you drive me,
or I waste my money on an Uber.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.265
What do you want?

20:32.298 --> 20:33.933
Okay, if I take you there
and they don't know shit,

20:33.967 --> 20:36.636
which they won't because
this whole thing is fucking
bullshit,

20:36.669 --> 20:38.671
you promise to take my advice
and step off?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.974
I promise, cross my heart.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.310
Jesus, okay, let's go.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.919
Come on, come on.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.355
Fuck!

20:55.388 --> 20:57.991
And tell him he needs
to come to me.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.959
No, I can't wait till 4:00!

20:59.993 --> 21:02.662
Tell him he needs to come now!

21:03.529 --> 21:04.931
What the fuck do you want?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.833
Listen, I don't want to cause
any problems, I promise.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.334
I just have a few more questions
about Krista.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.637
I don't know fucking Krista.
I told you that.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.871
I just want to talk.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.407
Please.
Lisa, listen, I just--

21:14.440 --> 21:17.810
You need to stay
the fuck out of my house.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.513
Lisa, we just want to talk.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.316
I told you to fuck off! Where is
it? Where the fuck is it?

21:23.349 --> 21:25.051
We just want to talk, Lisa.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.655
Give me a ride to Hyannis, and
I'll tell you whatever the fuck
you want to know.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.990
All right, deal,
but you got to talk first.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.560
Look, look, look.
Hey, we brought you this.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.396
Hmm?

21:36.429 --> 21:39.365
What the fuck
am I supposed to do with that?

21:39.399 --> 21:41.934
Um, feed your fucking baby.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.603
- Don't you fucking judge me.
- Hey.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.338
- Can't you fucking see that I'm
sick? - Hey, hey, hey.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.706
- Take it easy!
- Hey, just chill out!

21:58.885 --> 22:01.487
Okay, fine,
what do you want to know?

22:01.521 --> 22:02.922
Did Krista come here
after Sherry was killed?

22:02.955 --> 22:03.856
No.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.558
- Do you know where she might
be? - No, okay?

22:05.591 --> 22:07.360
Are you sure?

22:07.393 --> 22:08.795
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.632
- Whatever.
- Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait!

22:12.665 --> 22:13.833
Guys, wait!

22:13.866 --> 22:15.334
Hold on!
Hold on!

22:15.368 --> 22:17.036
Just w--hold on.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.342
She left this here, okay?

22:25.611 --> 22:26.813
Can I have it?

22:51.938 --> 22:53.606
Fucking dirty laundry.
Fuck.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.475
They pawned her shit.
That's why they lied to you.

22:55.508 --> 22:56.609
You got played.

22:58.845 --> 22:59.879
- What?
- Fuck you.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.547
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.850
You're supposedly fucking sober,
but you happen to have dope on
you.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.685
I'm not using, bro, all right?
I'll take a piss test right now.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.453
- You know what? Honestly--
- It's not--no.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.521
- It's just a job, all right?
- Whatever.

23:08.554 --> 23:09.622
I don't give a fuck, okay?

23:09.655 --> 23:10.990
It's just wack--
you giving me advice.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.925
Well, you know, do as I say,
not as I do, right?

23:12.959 --> 23:14.127
Really, bro?

23:15.962 --> 23:17.563
Look, I gave you a ride.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.098
I got you a bunch
of panties to sniff.

23:19.132 --> 23:20.500
- Oh, man, come on.
- And not for nothing,

23:20.533 --> 23:21.901
but I gave that chick
$100 worth of dope.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.670
No, and don't call it panties.
That's disgusting.

23:24.704 --> 23:25.772
What am I supposed to call 'em?

23:25.805 --> 23:27.640
Underwear, like a normal person.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.642
You're so fucking stubborn.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.851
This Krista shit, it's...

23:38.885 --> 23:40.987
It's a dead end, all right?

23:41.020 --> 23:42.955
There's literally a pile
of dirty underwear

23:42.989 --> 23:44.757
sitting here
telling you the same thing.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.962
You know what?
Just start the car and drive,
okay?

24:57.964 --> 24:59.866
You've reached Devonne.
You know what to do.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.234
Leave a message at the tone.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.908
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck...

25:18.084 --> 25:20.186
Thank you everyone who made
this meeting possible.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.255
I'm your secretary.
Martin's the treasurer.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.689
Donald does AA literature.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.192
Phyllis,
thank you for the snacks today.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.693
That reminds me.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.662
We have an open
coffee commitment,

25:29.695 --> 25:32.131
if anyone wants it.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.767
When you were new,
there was coffee for you.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.872
I'll do it.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.908
Thank you, Junior.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.781
We'll see you next week
or the next meeting.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.618
Mm-mm.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.587
You're not gonna
sign my court card?

25:54.620 --> 25:56.656
- You were late.
- Oh, who gives a shit?

25:56.689 --> 25:57.790
I'm late to everything.
Here.

25:57.823 --> 25:59.959
I have some advice for you...

25:59.992 --> 26:02.795
four little words that are
gonna change your life forever.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.197
Okay, man, lay it on me.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.767
Start leaving earlier, bitch.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.006
Yeah, come on!

26:14.040 --> 26:15.608
Hey, give me your court card.

26:15.641 --> 26:16.809
Why?

26:16.842 --> 26:17.810
Just--here.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.017
Anyone can sign these things,
you know?

26:28.654 --> 26:29.855
Thanks.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.961
Can I bum a smoke?

26:34.994 --> 26:36.963
Oh, wow, you're just
full-blown doing it now, huh?

26:36.996 --> 26:38.297
Come on, Junior, please.

26:50.776 --> 26:54.013
I'm sorry.
I'm not, like...

26:54.046 --> 26:55.614
I'm not, like,
fucking proud of it, you know.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.850
It's just you got to do
what you got to do.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.867
See you later.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.137
Hey.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.372
I know you got to do
what you got to do,

27:19.405 --> 27:21.340
but, like...

27:21.374 --> 27:22.875
so do I.

27:22.908 --> 27:26.312
Only difference is
I got a baby to feed.

27:26.345 --> 27:29.315
You got a suitcase full
of panties in it.

27:55.941 --> 27:57.376
God damn it.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.203
Some bitch always got to
cause problems.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.971
Now, if people just mind
their own damn business,

28:26.005 --> 28:28.040
then maybe I could stay sober.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.276
But somebody always got to
start some shit.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.445
Why are you even here?
Didn't they boot you out?

28:32.478 --> 28:34.246
But that's why they call it
"outpatient," bitch.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.715
Uh, Bethany, that's enough.

28:36.749 --> 28:39.118
Jackie, would you like to share?

28:39.151 --> 28:43.489
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Okay, uh...

28:43.722 --> 28:47.293
So I got 12 days today.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.861
I'm feeling pretty good,

28:48.894 --> 28:51.130
but I have this situation
with this girl.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.799
Some of you guys
might know her, Krista Collins.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.102
She's my road dog,
and I haven't heard from her in
a while.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.169
I'm getting kind of worried.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.805
If you know anything,
let me know.

28:59.839 --> 29:03.943
Thank you for sharing, Jackie,
and congrats on 12 days.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.912
Seriously, that's a big deal.

29:06.946 --> 29:09.782
So who else
would like to share?

29:09.815 --> 29:12.151
Come on, not all at once, now.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.257
Hey, girl, how you been?

29:18.290 --> 29:20.893
Can I bum a smoke?

29:20.926 --> 29:24.230
Really?
That's all you have to say to
me?

29:24.263 --> 29:25.464
- What the fuck you doing back
here? - Whoa!

29:25.498 --> 29:26.499
Hey!
Don't fucking touch me.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.067
What?
I'll fucking touch you.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.468
- Fight! Fight!
- Don't fucking touch me!

29:29.502 --> 29:31.170
I just want to know
about Krista, okay?

29:31.203 --> 29:32.538
I just want to know about
Krista, and I'll be gone.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.807
Man, I know that bitch.
We was in group together, man.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.042
- Don't fucking touch me, all
right? - Man, "road dog," my
ass!

29:37.076 --> 29:38.077
You weren't even here
at the same time as her!

29:38.110 --> 29:39.011
All right!

29:39.044 --> 29:41.046
Fine, you're right! You're
right. I don't know her, okay?

29:41.080 --> 29:43.449
So what the fuck
you doing here?

29:43.482 --> 29:46.452
Krista's friend Sherry was shot
in the head last week, and now
Krista's gone.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.854
And nobody gives a fuck,
not even the cops, all right?

29:48.888 --> 29:49.555
No one except me.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.323
So what, you just came here
to find some shit out?

29:51.357 --> 29:53.125
Yes!

29:53.159 --> 29:54.827
Fuck, yes.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.332
Yo, what the fuck
y'all niggas looking at?

30:00.366 --> 30:03.235
Back the fuck up!

30:03.269 --> 30:05.271
Shit.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.843
Uh, Krista talked about some
sugar daddy up in Wareham...

30:10.876 --> 30:12.311
right, a married guy.

30:12.344 --> 30:16.115
- What's his name?
- I don't know. Something
Italian-y.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.560
Anthony Delviccario?

30:27.593 --> 30:28.561
Yeah.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.095
Yeah, he got a construction
company or something up there.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.897
Maybe she's holed up with him.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.234
Yeah.
Thank you.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.837
And, hey, I'm sorry that I got
you kicked out or whatever.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.039
Oh, go fuck yourself.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.889
Hey, boo, you need to call me.

30:56.922 --> 30:59.959
Some bitch is asking questions
about that thing in Truro.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.460
Call me.

31:01.493 --> 31:04.930
Yeah.
So what?

31:04.964 --> 31:08.167
So what? It's his home Remy's.
It's part of his routine.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.169
That means he either lives or
works somewhere near Yarmouth.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.337
Hey, hey. Look, look, look.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.005
Let me just sit on the place
for a little while.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.506
I'll prove it to you.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.009
You want to hang out
at a Remy's, be my guest,

31:17.042 --> 31:18.978
but I'm not putting people
on a restaurant

31:19.011 --> 31:22.081
that he may or may not hit
sometime this week.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.515
Shit.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.551
Edelman's questionable
for the opener.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.487
- Hey.
- You want to do something?

31:28.520 --> 31:29.888
Yeah, I want to do something.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.090
How about some
fucking police work?

31:31.123 --> 31:32.658
Get yourself a new informant

31:32.891 --> 31:35.060
and tell the other mopes
on your unit, too.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.263
Go on.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.931
Fucking Velekee, man.

31:38.964 --> 31:42.034
"Get a new informant,"
like it's so easy.

31:43.469 --> 31:46.639
Now we out here playing
pick-a-snitch in Yarmouth.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.340
Pretty nice place
for a trap house.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.976
- Almond?
- Fucking almond.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.652
What do we have here?

32:31.583 --> 32:34.286
Oh, Jesus Christ.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.563
- We're gonna need that Narcan.
- All right.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.532
Hey!

32:46.565 --> 32:47.633
Shit.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.584
All right.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.985
Hey, what's your name?

33:07.019 --> 33:09.054
- Fuck.
- Hey, fuck, you overdosed.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.723
Look, look,
you just overdosed.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.359
- No, I didn't.
- No, stay still.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.294
Ray!

33:15.327 --> 33:16.495
Hey, Ray!

33:16.528 --> 33:18.764
Oh, shit, Alan!

33:22.000 --> 33:23.135
Hey, you.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.703
You know where I got to go
when I leave here?

33:24.737 --> 33:26.638
I'm gonna go
to my partner's wife's house

33:26.672 --> 33:30.275
and tell her that her husband's
gonna be a paraplegic because of
you.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.710
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.379
You didn't mean to hurt anyone?

33:33.412 --> 33:36.181
You think that's
a fucking excuse?

33:36.215 --> 33:38.083
That doesn't cut shit, asshole!

33:38.117 --> 33:40.753
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you. "I'm sorry."

33:43.122 --> 33:45.157
I want to go home.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.160
You should be fucking begging me
to stay here.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.728
The moment you walk
out that door,

33:49.762 --> 33:51.697
every cop in the goddamn Cape
is gonna be gunning for you.

33:51.730 --> 33:55.033
Please, I didn't meant it.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.402
Yeah, you're fucking crying now.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.537
Don't be a fucking pussy.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.173
How about you start talking?

34:01.206 --> 34:04.510
Do you know that guy?
Goes by Osito.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.779
- Fuck.
- Fuck what? Do you know him?

34:06.812 --> 34:08.714
- Yeah.
- Yeah? How do you know him?

34:08.747 --> 34:10.482
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.451
Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey.
Look at me. Look at me.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.685
- Fuck.
- Look--whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.054
What's the matter?

34:18.824 --> 34:20.692
Jesus fucking Christ, really?

34:20.726 --> 34:23.262
These fucking junkies.

34:24.296 --> 34:25.397
Hey.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.466
Hey, this kid needs a hospital
right now.

34:27.499 --> 34:28.567
Don't you fucking let him die.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.568
I want him back here
first thing in the morning.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.537
All right.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.105
- You heard him.
- Jesus.

34:33.138 --> 34:35.274
Hey, that kid talk?

34:35.307 --> 34:37.676
Oh, yeah, and if he lives,
he's gonna cooperate.

34:37.709 --> 34:41.547
- He knows Osito.
- Get the fuck out of here.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.615
- How's the wrist?
- Oh, man, it's just a sprain.

34:43.649 --> 34:46.351
Take the rest of the day off,
go home,

34:46.385 --> 34:48.454
hang out with the kid.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.389
You don't know his name,
do you?

34:50.422 --> 34:52.291
Didn't know it was a boy.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.460
Fucker.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.580
Hello?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.582
Hi, is this Anthony Delviccario?

35:16.615 --> 35:17.850
Yeah.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.452
From Delviccario Construction?

35:20.486 --> 35:22.554
Looks at the first pitch
after the strikeout...

35:22.588 --> 35:23.722
Who's this?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.258
You don't know me,
but I'm looking

35:26.291 --> 35:27.793
for a friend of yours,
Krista Collins.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.797
Not interested, thanks.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.365
But--

35:35.734 --> 35:37.836
Oh, you lying motherfucker!

35:54.753 --> 35:57.189
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

35:57.222 --> 35:59.525
Well, you know, the Sox are down
7-3, but who gives a shit?

35:59.558 --> 36:00.826
Fucking dynasty.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.594
Yeah, so, listen,
I got to go to Wareham for a
minute.

36:02.628 --> 36:05.564
Can I borrow your car?
I promise I'll be careful.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.533
Are you fucking joking right
now? You lost your license.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.635
Yeah, so? You're my sponsor.
You have to help me.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.303
You are so fucked in the head

36:11.336 --> 36:12.871
if you think that's
how it works.

36:12.905 --> 36:15.274
So what, I'm supposed
to prostitute myself for a ride?

36:15.307 --> 36:16.708
Hit the streets, hooker.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.681
- What are you doing here?
- He brought you something.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.551
Excuse me.
Who are you?

36:59.585 --> 37:02.721
I'm Kathleen, Osito's girl.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.356
We met before.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.526
Kathleen, honey, why don't you
go ask the bartender for a
Sprite?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.363
You heard her.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.312
Why so cold?

37:31.483 --> 37:32.618
I got a gift for you.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.495
What's this about?

37:43.528 --> 37:45.998
Frankie wanted you to have it.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.432
For what?

37:48.834 --> 37:50.435
I don't know.

37:50.469 --> 37:53.639
And I don't plan on getting
into you two guys' business,

37:53.672 --> 37:55.774
but I ain't leaving
till I see you take that
envelope.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.382
Happy?

38:05.817 --> 38:08.553
Kat, come on.
We out.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.695
I ain't never had a bitch
not thank me for some money.

38:40.385 --> 38:41.720
Devonne.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.991
Jackie, what...

38:46.024 --> 38:48.427
What are you doing here?

38:48.460 --> 38:49.928
I'm sorry to just show up,
but when I call,

38:49.961 --> 38:50.962
you just send me to voice mail.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.732
And what does that tell you?

38:53.765 --> 38:55.867
I--can I come in,
just for a minute?

38:55.901 --> 38:58.437
I just want to talk.
Please.

39:04.409 --> 39:05.610
We can talk here.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.749
Okay, yeah.
I get it.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.088
I went to rehab.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.092
I'm sober.

39:21.426 --> 39:23.862
Really? You?

39:23.895 --> 39:25.864
Yeah.

39:25.897 --> 39:28.734
And...

39:28.767 --> 39:30.736
I feel good.

39:30.769 --> 39:34.973
I feel good, like, better
than I have in a long time.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.008
Like, I could be
a different person.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.112
Like, you could be
or like you are?

39:43.148 --> 39:44.983
All I know is that
since I quit drinking,

39:45.016 --> 39:47.152
I can't stop thinking about you.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.927
What are you looking at?

39:55.961 --> 39:58.997
I'm sorry.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.134
You're still doing it.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.836
Well, you still got those lips.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.816
Mm. Mm.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.005
Wait.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.006
Get the towel.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.574
Get the towel.

41:01.226 --> 41:04.663
Hey, guys, it's me, Candy,

41:04.696 --> 41:07.632
and I've missed you so much.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.902
I'm working this weekend
at Xavier's.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.504
It'll be live.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.607
Come in, Ma.

42:26.578 --> 42:28.146
What, you gonna jump
out the fucking window?

42:28.179 --> 42:29.214
Dude, I was gonna call you.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.650
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.184
- Why didn't you?
- 'Cause I got a new phone--

42:33.218 --> 42:35.754
Shut the fuck up.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.656
We're going for a ride.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.631
I'm sorry, all right?
I know I fucked up, bro.

42:46.665 --> 42:48.099
I should've known
about the supermoon.

42:48.133 --> 42:50.602
I mean, I would have went out
an extra five miles if I'd have
known.

42:50.635 --> 42:52.003
I mean, fuck, I would have
gone out 100 miles,

42:52.037 --> 42:54.039
but I-I swear to you
and Frankie,

42:54.072 --> 42:55.907
I-I will totally
make this up to you guys.

42:55.941 --> 42:59.010
Look, I've been pumping.
Here.

42:59.044 --> 43:01.012
All right, I'm up--I'm upping
my game, bro, all right?

43:01.046 --> 43:02.247
You can keep this.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.249
There's gonna be more
where that came from.

43:17.329 --> 43:20.832
You know Frankie wanted me
to kill you, right?

43:20.865 --> 43:22.667
Wait, seriously?
You fucking with me?

43:25.103 --> 43:27.772
If I did kill you...

43:27.806 --> 43:29.674
I'd make sure to get rid of you
the right way.

43:31.776 --> 43:34.312
Stab you in the lungs,
in the guts.

43:34.346 --> 43:36.715
You'd never come back.

43:39.751 --> 43:41.987
But it's not your fault.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.188
You ain't know.

43:43.221 --> 43:44.923
You soft.

43:47.225 --> 43:48.994
It's my job to toughen you up.

43:51.262 --> 43:53.398
Y-yeah.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.233
For real.

43:55.266 --> 43:57.302
But first...

43:57.335 --> 43:58.870
we gonna go
get something to eat.

44:07.245 --> 44:09.414
You like Motorhead?

44:09.647 --> 44:11.182
I--

44:11.216 --> 44:13.418
Sure, yeah.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.120
Fuck, man.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.355
I got a question for you.

44:17.389 --> 44:19.224
Who you think will
win in a fight

44:19.257 --> 44:22.694
between Lemmy and God?

44:22.727 --> 44:25.363
Trick question.
Lemmy is God.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.670
- It's a good one, right?
- Yeah.

44:33.905 --> 44:36.975
Can't take credit
for it, though.

44:37.008 --> 44:38.109
Read it on a forum.

44:38.143 --> 44:40.311
Yo, what the fuck
are we doing here?

44:43.848 --> 44:45.083
You gonna eat that?

44:55.960 --> 44:57.462
Yo, you see this
guy right there?

44:57.695 --> 44:58.963
I want you to go fuck him up.

44:58.997 --> 45:00.765
That guy, why?

45:00.799 --> 45:03.001
'Cause motherfucker keeps
forgetting the cheese.

45:03.034 --> 45:05.403
Besides, this is a chance
for you not to be a pussy.

45:06.971 --> 45:08.406
So go beat his ass.

45:10.341 --> 45:13.044
Motherfucker,
am I speaking Greek?

45:13.078 --> 45:14.946
- Go.
- No.

45:14.979 --> 45:16.114
Hurry up.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.023
All right.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.194
Can I help you?

45:32.230 --> 45:33.832
Yeah, fuck off.

45:33.865 --> 45:35.934
What?

45:35.967 --> 45:36.935
What are you doing?

45:36.968 --> 45:37.936
Hey, fuck you, motherfucker.

45:37.969 --> 45:39.170
What's your problem, dude?

45:39.204 --> 45:40.271
I don't have a problem.
You have a problem?

45:43.508 --> 45:45.777
Fucking junkie.

46:02.026 --> 46:03.294
Stop!

46:03.328 --> 46:05.530
Stop!

46:05.763 --> 46:07.165
Fuck! Stop!

46:07.198 --> 46:08.933
- Who's a bitch, huh?
- Stop!

46:08.967 --> 46:11.035
That's right, suck my dick, son!

46:27.552 --> 46:29.254
Fuck!

46:32.357 --> 46:34.425
Shit feel good, don't it?

46:36.127 --> 46:37.495
Mm-hmm.

46:39.264 --> 46:41.099
Better than therapy.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.988
Hey.

47:04.022 --> 47:05.323
Hey.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.025
Hi.

47:07.058 --> 47:09.360
I brought you something.

47:09.394 --> 47:10.929
You brought me something?

47:10.962 --> 47:12.463
Thought your son might like it.

47:15.366 --> 47:17.969
- Cool.
- Mm-hmm.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.305
- Oh, you should keep going.
- Okay.

47:21.406 --> 47:22.840
An iPad?

47:22.874 --> 47:24.409
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

47:24.442 --> 47:26.377
Did this belong to some
drug dealer or something?

47:26.411 --> 47:29.080
No, that's brand-new.

47:29.113 --> 47:30.181
Take it.

47:30.215 --> 47:31.883
- Oh, I'm taking it.
- Are you?

47:31.916 --> 47:32.884
- Yeah.
- Good.

47:36.187 --> 47:38.289
Is that why you came here?

47:40.258 --> 47:42.360
Give me an iPad?

47:42.393 --> 47:44.128
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

47:44.162 --> 47:45.563
Yeah, and I wanted
to apologize...

47:45.597 --> 47:46.965
Oh.

47:46.998 --> 47:48.466
For the way I acted
last time I was here.

47:50.435 --> 47:53.071
That was real shitty of me.

47:53.104 --> 47:56.574
Mm, that's the job, right?

47:56.608 --> 47:58.209
To be shitty?

47:58.243 --> 48:00.078
I don't know.

48:04.983 --> 48:07.385
What?

48:07.418 --> 48:09.921
Nothing, you just...

48:09.954 --> 48:12.624
surprise me is all.

48:12.657 --> 48:15.260
Can I take you to dinner?

48:15.293 --> 48:18.429
Uh...
I don't think so.

48:23.368 --> 48:24.669
You can take me home, though.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.480
It's yours.
Keep it.

48:36.681 --> 48:37.982
For reals?

48:41.486 --> 48:42.954
Enjoy it, bro.

48:55.266 --> 48:56.367
Hey, baby.

48:56.401 --> 49:00.438
I want you to pack a bag,
put on a thong...

49:00.471 --> 49:02.540
Mom's gonna watch
Mackayleigh tonight.

49:02.573 --> 49:04.609
I'm getting us a hotel room.

49:19.257 --> 49:22.660
You know, I've, uh,
never been in the front seat

49:22.694 --> 49:24.162
of a cop car before.

49:25.430 --> 49:26.597
How does that feel?

49:28.232 --> 49:29.567
You drive too fast.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.702
- Do I?
- Mm-hmm.

49:30.735 --> 49:32.070
'Cause I want to get there.

49:39.043 --> 49:41.012
Why don't you get there?

49:45.383 --> 49:47.585
Look, I don't want to give you
the wrong impression, but, um,

49:47.618 --> 49:49.153
whatever you think this is,
it's not.

49:50.521 --> 49:53.358
Eh, you-you came to me,
remember?

49:53.391 --> 49:55.526
Oh, no, it's-it's not
that I don't want to.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.164
You are so full
of shit right now.

50:00.198 --> 50:01.366
- Am I?
- Yeah.

50:03.401 --> 50:07.405
You're-you're
trying to get me...

50:07.438 --> 50:11.109
to convince you to do something
that you want to do anyway.

50:16.447 --> 50:19.083
You know, we're adults.

50:19.117 --> 50:20.718
We can handle ourselves.

50:23.421 --> 50:26.023
You know what you want.

50:26.057 --> 50:27.725
And I do, too.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.795
Tell me what you want.

50:33.598 --> 50:35.633
Why don't you pull over
and I can show you?

51:11.402 --> 51:13.204
Maybe I want something.

52:02.887 --> 52:05.723
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:06.791 --> 52:09.160
I told you.

52:09.193 --> 52:11.195
Told me what?

52:11.229 --> 52:12.630
Sober sex can be good, too.

52:14.799 --> 52:18.769
I've had sober sex before.

52:18.803 --> 52:20.171
Oh, have you?

52:20.204 --> 52:22.707
I mean, mostly not,
but, yeah, totally.

52:27.879 --> 52:29.647
Yeah, so I got to run
some errands, okay?

52:29.680 --> 52:32.450
Okay.
I'll go with you.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.719
No, it's just kind of
some shit I got to do,

52:34.752 --> 52:37.255
but can I maybe borrow your car
for a minute?

52:37.288 --> 52:38.623
Where's yours?

52:38.656 --> 52:41.225
In the shop.

52:41.259 --> 52:43.294
Is that what this was about,
you needing my car?

52:43.327 --> 52:45.162
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

52:45.196 --> 52:47.632
Oh, right, you just wanted
to get ass in the process.

52:48.933 --> 52:50.768
It's fine, Jackie.

52:52.837 --> 52:53.804
Fine?

52:53.838 --> 52:56.207
There's the keys.
Take 'em.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.708
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

52:57.742 --> 53:01.379
As long as you know
you're back on your bullshit.

53:01.412 --> 53:03.214
What's my bullshit?

53:03.247 --> 53:07.385
Using people for sex,
for companionship,

53:07.418 --> 53:08.920
for a fucking car.

53:14.225 --> 53:16.761
Thank you, and I hear you.

53:16.794 --> 53:20.598
I hear you, and I promise you
that I will make it up to you.

53:20.631 --> 53:23.935
And I wouldn't do it
if it wasn't important.

53:44.755 --> 53:46.757
Okay.
All right.

53:57.835 --> 53:59.937
Good girl, Krista.
