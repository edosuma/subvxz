00:34.367 --> 00:37.736
Hi, I'm Slim Biggins,
owner and operator

00:37.738 --> 00:40.806
of the Bigg Nugget
Riverboat Casino,

00:40.808 --> 00:44.476
which arrives
in Stoolbend, Virginia today.

00:44.478 --> 00:48.414
Do you like cash,
whores and extra oxygen?

00:48.416 --> 00:49.648
Ha! Are you human?

00:49.650 --> 00:52.885
Then come on down to
the Bigg Nugget, where you could

00:52.887 --> 00:56.455
double, triple,
quadruple your money.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.724
"Five-times-ify"
your money supply.

00:58.726 --> 01:02.194
I'll see <i>you</i>
<i>at the Bigg Nugget,</i>

01:02.196 --> 01:03.796
where the fun is...

01:03.798 --> 01:06.065
explosive!

01:06.866 --> 01:08.901
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

01:08.903 --> 01:11.770
Donna, thank God
you're here!

01:11.772 --> 01:12.771
(groaning)

01:12.773 --> 01:14.807
Cleveland, what
is wrong with you?

01:14.809 --> 01:16.442
I've got the fever.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.443
Gambling fever!

01:17.445 --> 01:19.178
And you know how
to guard against the flu,

01:19.180 --> 01:21.847
they inject you
with a little bit of the flu?

01:21.849 --> 01:23.515
Well, in much
the same way,

01:23.517 --> 01:25.784
the only cure
for gambling fever

01:25.786 --> 01:27.853
is a little bit
of gambling!

01:27.855 --> 01:29.788
Riverboat gambling!

01:29.790 --> 01:31.290
Cleveland,
I've seen that ad,

01:31.292 --> 01:33.459
and I do not want you
going to a casino.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.794
Casinos ruined my
Aunt Betty's life.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.297
That's 'cause Uncle Reggie
kept winning

01:38.299 --> 01:39.598
and winning and winning,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.733
until he realized
he did not have to be married

01:41.735 --> 01:43.702
to a fat nag anymore,
so he left her

01:43.704 --> 01:47.272
for a smokin' hot cocktail
waitress with perfect breasts.

01:47.274 --> 01:51.443
Donna, what you consider
a cautionary tale,

01:51.445 --> 01:54.279
to this listener,
promises a second chapter

01:54.281 --> 01:56.849
for a life that's
had too few pleasures.

01:56.851 --> 01:59.818
Look, fool, if you really
have the gambling bug,

01:59.820 --> 02:02.454
I've got just
the cure for you.

02:04.991 --> 02:08.227
Hmm, I know two sixes
are pretty good.

02:08.229 --> 02:08.861
(groaning)

02:08.863 --> 02:11.763
Cleveland, let's say
you had two sixes.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.732
Would that be
higher or lower

02:13.734 --> 02:15.501
than the cards
you currently have?

02:15.503 --> 02:19.338
Higher.
Then I'm all in.
60 cents.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.305
A pair of sixes.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.007
Ha-ha! Pair of jacks!

02:22.009 --> 02:23.275
Suck it!
(gasps)

02:23.277 --> 02:24.710
It is you who will suck

02:24.712 --> 02:27.346
from the tit of the
Devil for lying.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.848
Pump your brakes!
Full house!

02:29.850 --> 02:32.351
Four dollars
and 38 cents.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.554
Hey, now you're
toilet paper rich.

02:35.556 --> 02:39.391
This goes straight into
Roberta's college fund.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.026
What do you got in there

02:41.028 --> 02:43.996
so far--
14, 15 bucks?

02:43.998 --> 02:47.466
$2,412.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.300
Damn!

02:48.302 --> 02:49.434
I know where this is going.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.570
He's going to gamble the money
away at the riverboat.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.106
Why are we watching
this if we know what's
going to happen?

02:54.108 --> 02:57.009
I know you're going to knock
the bong over every night,

02:57.011 --> 02:58.544
but I still invite you over.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.811
You're right.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.414
Whoa, dude,
we're on TV!
Whoa!

03:02.416 --> 03:03.515
Hey!
Hi, Mom!

03:03.517 --> 03:04.116
Yes!
Hi! Um...

03:04.118 --> 03:07.186
Hi, Aunt Carol! Hi!
Hey, everybody!

03:07.854 --> 03:09.354
He's bluffing.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.757
(cell phone beeps)

03:13.526 --> 03:16.161
Uh, Donna,
how we doing on grapes?

03:16.163 --> 03:18.630
We low? I'm gonna
make a grape run.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.299
Oh, okay.
Bye!

03:20.301 --> 03:21.033
(door opens, shuts)

03:21.035 --> 03:22.668
What are you
guys doing here?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.336
We're going down
to the Bigg Nugget.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.571
And you're coming with us.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.106
Sorry, guys.
Donna doesn't want me to go.

03:28.108 --> 03:32.444
But, we, we got you this new
plum-colored Lou Bega suit.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.079
Mm, that is sharp.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.048
And plum is my color.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.416
Come on. I'll drive.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.817
We'll take Apollonia.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.452
But go slow.
This is the first time

03:40.454 --> 03:43.322
she's had four guys
inside her at once.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.058
You know what? I'm in!

03:46.060 --> 03:47.092
Let's go!
Yeah!

03:47.094 --> 03:49.061
Yee-haw!
Casey Affleck!

03:49.063 --> 03:51.563
(hip-hop)

03:51.565 --> 03:54.733
Hey! Must be the money!

03:56.736 --> 03:59.438
♪ Hey! Must be the money!

04:00.306 --> 04:01.673
(scooter motor revving)

04:01.675 --> 04:03.442
Hey, that's my camera!

04:03.943 --> 04:04.876
Ah, joke's on him.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.279
It's all close-ups
of my man parts.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.615
(big band music plays)

04:15.755 --> 04:18.023
(clinking)

04:23.029 --> 04:25.163
(coughing)

04:25.165 --> 04:28.066
Oh, man,
this-this bad boy even has

04:28.068 --> 04:29.568
an all-you-can-eat buffet.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.571
I'm going to go
see if their Sports
Book's got Bumfutch.

04:32.573 --> 04:36.708
Our country doesn't
take care of its veterans.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.779
Hey, aren't you
Slim Biggins from
the commercials?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.548
Damn right.
Wow, you're on TV.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.984
Are you a pervert
like Pat O'Brien?

04:45.986 --> 04:47.519
No, Mr. Brown,
I am not.

04:47.521 --> 04:51.356
How do you know my name?
I didn't! Now, come sit

04:51.358 --> 04:52.824
next to Mr. Yellow
over here.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.961
Can we get my friend
here a free cocktail?

04:55.963 --> 04:59.064
Wow, sitting next
to an Asian guy

04:59.066 --> 05:00.532
having a free drink...

05:00.534 --> 05:02.801
I could get
used to this.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.406
(Cleveland chuckles)

05:07.408 --> 05:09.875
Hooray!
I just keep winning.

05:09.877 --> 05:14.046
I feel like a homeowner
before 2008!

05:14.048 --> 05:15.414
Lordy me!

05:15.416 --> 05:16.882
Look at that
stack of chips.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.484
Looks like somebody
just earned his way

05:19.486 --> 05:21.486
into Club Nugget.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.254
Club Nugget!

05:22.256 --> 05:24.056
Both of those
individually

05:24.058 --> 05:26.158
are names of
porno magazines.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.893
<i>Oui,</i> Hustler.
And it's also

05:27.895 --> 05:30.095
the name of this
casino's exclusive

05:30.097 --> 05:31.963
VIP player's club.

05:31.965 --> 05:32.764
All right, dealer.

05:32.766 --> 05:37.502
How 'bout another blackjack
for this brown Brown?

05:37.504 --> 05:38.437
Blackjack!

05:38.439 --> 05:39.137
Who's your daddy?

05:39.139 --> 05:41.139
CROWD:
We don't know your name!

05:41.141 --> 05:42.441
It's Cleveland!

05:42.443 --> 05:43.642
CROWD:
Cleveland!

05:43.644 --> 05:45.110
(giddy laughter)

05:45.112 --> 05:47.446
CROWD (sorrowful):
Cleveland.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.780
(cries): Oh!

05:48.782 --> 05:50.082
You had a good 12 minutes.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.483
I don't know what happened.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.019
Shoot, Mr. Brown,
I was under the impression

05:54.021 --> 05:55.520
that you were
a high roller,

05:55.522 --> 05:56.988
but, clearly,
I was mistaken.

05:56.990 --> 06:01.093
I'm going to have to ask
you for your VIP card back.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.494
I am a high roller.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.029
I'm just short of cash.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.465
Would it be possible
for me to wager

06:06.467 --> 06:08.533
in furs or chalices

06:08.535 --> 06:11.803
or Elizabethan
marital aids?
Sure.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.505
Of these things, I have none.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.942
Would it be possible for me
to wager a sofa cushion

06:16.944 --> 06:18.744
with a stripe
of human feces on it,

06:18.746 --> 06:22.848
which has been facing down
for, oh, some months now?

06:22.850 --> 06:23.949
No.
Damn.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.984
Of these things,
I have two.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.487
I'll find some money.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.122
(patrons screaming)

06:32.225 --> 06:34.960
All-you-can-eat
my furry ass.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.162
(roaring)

06:41.234 --> 06:42.934
Money, money...

06:42.936 --> 06:45.003
Junior's piggy bank.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.141
Mixed nuts and a pickle?

06:53.212 --> 06:56.615
I can't do that to Ramona.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.650
(muffled chatter)

06:58.652 --> 06:59.951
What was that?

06:59.953 --> 07:03.622
I said, does your husband
play cards?

07:03.624 --> 07:04.356
(laughs)

07:04.358 --> 07:05.757
But this is
my stepdaughter's

07:05.759 --> 07:07.959
college money
you're talking about.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.528
Or I'm thinking about.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.730
Or whatever's going on here.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.864
Oh, what's $2,000

07:12.866 --> 07:13.799
gonna get her anyway?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.200
Half a semester
of clown college?

07:15.202 --> 07:17.135
Why not take a shot
at turning that

07:17.137 --> 07:19.271
into money for a <i>real</i> education,

07:19.273 --> 07:22.541
like at the University
of Delaware?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.277
Oh, yeah! Yes!
Yeah! Yes!

07:25.279 --> 07:26.745
Yes! That's cool!
U.D.! U.D.!

07:26.747 --> 07:29.381
Delaware! Delaware!
Delaware! Whoo!
U.D.! That's us!

07:29.383 --> 07:31.817
That's us! Whoo! Oops.
(laughing)

07:31.819 --> 07:34.419
Well, I guess
I can't keep losing.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.188
Well, it's statistically
impossible.

07:36.190 --> 07:39.324
And they do say you're supposed
to chase your bets.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.226
That's what
the casino owners say.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.629
As Kevin Spacey
said to Tom Cruise,

07:44.631 --> 07:46.198
"I'm all in."

07:46.732 --> 07:50.135
No, Dad! Stop! Wait!

07:52.705 --> 07:56.641
High roller Cleveland Brown,
reporting for duty.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.749
Mr. Brown, 12 showing.

08:05.618 --> 08:06.885
My plum suit!

08:06.887 --> 08:08.520
My plums!

08:11.257 --> 08:12.924
22, bust.

08:12.926 --> 08:16.361
Rober... Rober...
Roberta's college money!

08:16.363 --> 08:17.996
Oh!

08:31.644 --> 08:33.612
(sighs) All this

08:33.614 --> 08:35.247
and no one to share it with.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.314
WOMAN:
Mr. Biggins?

08:36.316 --> 08:38.116
A Mr. Brown to see you.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.885
Thank you, Miss Bazoombas.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.121
(making goofy
bazoomba sound)

08:43.123 --> 08:46.057
Yes. Now, what can
I do for you, Mr. Brown?

08:46.059 --> 08:49.194
May I please have my money back?
No.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.896
Please?
Yes.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.830
Really?
No.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.599
Well, I've done
all I can do.
Hold up.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.903
I'm going to give
you a chance to earn
back your money

08:57.905 --> 08:58.970
by working for me.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.839
You think you
could bartend?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.307
Of course
I could bartend.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.010
Mr. Biggins, you
are talking to a man

09:05.012 --> 09:07.445
who once sold ice
to an Eskimo.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.080
Hey, buddy.
You guys sell ice?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.182
You're an Eskimo,
aren't you?

09:11.184 --> 09:12.317
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I know.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.218
37 words for snow, whatever.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.787
I'm in the middle of a party.
We ran out of ice.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.756
Is the party in your igloo?

09:17.758 --> 09:20.091
No, it's in my condo,
and that's offensive.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.927
Seriously, can you
just sell me the ice?

09:21.929 --> 09:23.628
I got, like,
12 people waiting.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.996
Thanks, man.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.299
(giggles)

09:28.935 --> 09:31.870
(floorboards creaking)

09:31.872 --> 09:33.738
Just gonna sneak in here.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.174
No one will be the wiser.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.175
Ow! Bitch!

09:37.177 --> 09:38.977
Got to rack your weights!

09:38.979 --> 09:40.612
(crashing, beating)
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ow!

09:40.614 --> 09:43.782
ANNOUNCER:
Spike TV's <i>Hundred Most</i>
<i>J</i> <i>arring Noises!</i>

09:43.784 --> 09:45.383
Number 57... (woman screams)
No! No! No!

09:45.385 --> 09:47.485
56... (jackhammering)
Shh! Shh!

09:47.487 --> 09:49.054
55... (bird screeches)
Quiet! Quiet!

09:49.056 --> 09:50.889
54. (car alarm blaring)
Gonna wake the whole...

09:50.891 --> 09:52.791
ANNOUNCER: 53.
MEN: Ooh-a, ooh-a!
Shut up! Shut up!

09:52.793 --> 09:54.025
ANNOUNCER: 52.
(chimp screeching)

09:54.027 --> 09:55.026
(turns off TV)

09:55.028 --> 09:56.861
What the hell is
going on down here?

09:56.863 --> 09:59.698
Cleveland, where have
you been all night?

09:59.700 --> 10:00.799
You caught me.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.233
It was gonna be a surprise,

10:02.235 --> 10:06.371
but for the next three months
I'll be, um,

10:06.373 --> 10:09.774
taking night classes
to earn my degree

10:09.776 --> 10:12.844
as a, a court stenographer.

10:12.846 --> 10:13.445
What? Why?

10:13.447 --> 10:16.014
Because sometimes,
a man's got to earn

10:16.016 --> 10:17.549
a little extra money
for his family

10:17.551 --> 10:19.951
by typing on a weird
little keyboard.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.188
Well, look at you
putting this family first.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.789
Working your
fingers to the bone,

10:24.791 --> 10:26.191
striking things
from the record.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.193
Having no visible
emotional reaction

10:28.195 --> 10:30.862
to often quite
startling testimony.

10:30.864 --> 10:34.933
Mm! My strong, silent
court stenographer, mm.

10:34.935 --> 10:38.036
Why don't you bring
those fast fingers upstairs

10:38.038 --> 10:40.138
and see if your
quick brown fox

10:40.140 --> 10:41.840
can jump over my lazy dog?

10:41.842 --> 10:45.410
I find the defendant,
Donna Tubbs, sexy.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.179
I sentence her to
three to five minutes.

10:48.181 --> 10:52.083
Can I get extra time
for bad behavior?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.985
No!

10:56.389 --> 10:57.155
Here you go.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.524
And remember,
when it comes to good drinks,

10:59.526 --> 11:01.393
you can always
bet on Brown.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.995
My name's Cleveland
Brown, by the way.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.930
Oh, that's funny!

11:05.932 --> 11:07.799
(laughs)
He's funny.

11:07.801 --> 11:08.967
You're funny.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.068
He's funny.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.270
Uh, Cleveland,
you know Ted Lange?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.305
He played the bartender
on <i>The Love Boat.</i>

11:14.307 --> 11:17.976
Now he's playing the guy
who's taking your job.

11:17.978 --> 11:18.910
And I'm also playing

11:18.912 --> 11:20.912
Walter Lee Younger
from <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>

11:20.914 --> 11:23.815
at the Sarasota Playhouse
July 15 through the 29th.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.582
Cleveland, a bunch of kids

11:24.584 --> 11:28.019
were throwing Alka-Seltzers
to seagulls on the lido deck.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.189
You're playing the guy
who's cleaning up the guts.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.559
Ted Lange can't clean up the
seagull guts off the lido deck?

11:34.561 --> 11:37.462
No. That's your job.

11:39.031 --> 11:39.998
And when you're done,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.633
clean the urine troughs
under the dealers,

11:41.635 --> 11:45.003
clean out the cage of the
chicken who plays tic-tac-toe.

11:45.005 --> 11:45.970
You-you know what?

11:45.972 --> 11:47.605
Here's how you
remember your job.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.841
If something
stinks, clean it.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.310
Hey, boss, some bear
just voided himself

11:52.312 --> 11:53.778
all over the buffet.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.046
Get to it.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.848
(groans)

11:56.850 --> 11:58.883
(clucking)

12:01.821 --> 12:03.588
(electronic tone plays)

12:03.590 --> 12:05.924
(squawks)

12:06.859 --> 12:07.926
(groaning sigh)

12:07.928 --> 12:09.961
Roberta's college.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.598
Cleveland,
I'm going to need you

12:13.600 --> 12:15.900
to watch last night's
<i>Celebrity Apprentice</i>

12:15.902 --> 12:17.402
and tell me what happened.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.037
That's where I draw the line.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.841
Oh. Well, someone must
not want his paycheck.

12:22.843 --> 12:23.808
What the...?

12:23.810 --> 12:26.244
27 bucks
for a week's work?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.079
What are you
complaining about?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.115
You're making the
same as the chicken,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.916
and she's been
here three years.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.185
Does the chicken
have benefits?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.019
No.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.088
Hmm. This country.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.356
What're the odds?

12:38.358 --> 12:39.924
Well, of course.

12:39.926 --> 12:40.992
I lose again.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.027
Terrific. Fantastic.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.529
I'm having a great time.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.296
Oh, look-- two eights.

12:45.298 --> 12:49.134
I'll split them, 'cause that's
what you're supposed to do.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.236
And lose twice!

12:51.238 --> 12:52.937
Beautiful. Good.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.506
Take them away. I'm out.

12:54.508 --> 12:55.273
Fair enough.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.442
Some guys just
don't have the stones.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.344
You think I don't
have the stones?

12:59.346 --> 13:01.846
Well, guess what--
stones are on tour.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.248
Next stop: this table.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.916
Paint it blackjack.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.584
He's betting his car?!

13:06.586 --> 13:08.586
Why didn't I do that?

13:08.588 --> 13:10.522
Okay, hit me.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.091
Hey! What the hell?

13:13.093 --> 13:14.392
Oh, so sorry.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.193
Let me get that.

13:15.195 --> 13:19.731
That's the same Chinese
or Japanese or Vietnamese

13:19.733 --> 13:24.435
or Filipino or Korean
or guy from San Francisco

13:24.437 --> 13:27.138
who spilled his drink on me!

13:30.009 --> 13:33.344
Wha...? A crooked casino?

13:33.346 --> 13:34.579
Sorry about that.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.047
Here's your
card, sir.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.382
Oh! Oh!

13:38.217 --> 13:41.953
No! Not my car!

13:41.955 --> 13:43.188
Apollonia!

13:43.190 --> 13:45.557
(clucking)

13:54.300 --> 13:57.168
Hey, now your
sports coupe is
a chicken coop.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.004
ALL:
Shut up, Tim!

14:03.142 --> 14:06.744
Hey, Cleveland,
I was just telling the ladies

14:06.746 --> 14:10.181
how you're four weeks away
from being a court stenographer.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.183
Uh, Donna, about that.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.018
There's something
I have to tell you.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.421
I haven't been going
to night school

14:16.423 --> 14:17.722
to be a court stenographer.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.525
(gasps)
Sweet peas and jujubes!

14:20.527 --> 14:21.559
As a matter of fact,

14:21.561 --> 14:23.528
I've been spending my nights
at the Big Nugget.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.197
(gasps)
Sweet ham and braised lamb!

14:26.199 --> 14:28.166
And I took Roberta's
college money,

14:28.168 --> 14:29.200
and I gambled it all away.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.436
And since then, I've been
working nights at the casino,

14:31.438 --> 14:33.238
cleaning up after Tic Tac Toe,
playing chickens,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.373
and slaughtering horse
after horse after horse

14:35.375 --> 14:39.177
to make the money back, but
it's just not happening, Donna.

14:39.179 --> 14:39.711
I'm sorry.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.715
Sweet grass and succotash!
Sweet beans and din...

14:43.717 --> 14:46.317
Get ahold of yourself.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.518
(sighs)

14:47.520 --> 14:49.554
Thank you, but you
do that again

14:49.556 --> 14:51.890
and I will smack
the taste out your mouth.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.091
Not the taste!

14:53.093 --> 14:55.493
You stole my daughter's
college money?!

14:55.495 --> 14:58.329
Have you lost
your damn mind?!

14:58.331 --> 15:01.466
I was swindled,
and they got Holt, too.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.667
The baby man?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.669
Yes, the dealer
had a plant.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.170
And the plant
spilled a drink.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.639
And when he
spilled the drink,

15:07.641 --> 15:09.374
the dealer switched
the shoe and...

15:09.376 --> 15:11.743
(grunting)

15:11.745 --> 15:14.245
They got you
with the old

15:14.247 --> 15:16.281
Lone Star wet pants.

15:16.283 --> 15:20.051
Used to do it all the time
when I was a dealer

15:20.053 --> 15:23.354
in Monte Carlo back in 1962.

15:23.356 --> 15:27.258
<i>I had to lay low for a while,</i>
<i>because Mrs. Kennedy</i>

15:27.260 --> 15:29.294
<i>was starting to get suspicious.</i>

15:29.296 --> 15:30.895
<i>But it turned out</i>
<i>to be a blessing,</i>

15:30.897 --> 15:34.999
<i>because that's where I met</i>
<i>my first husband,</i>

15:35.001 --> 15:36.434
<i>Baron Heinrich von...</i>

15:36.436 --> 15:39.237
We don't have time
for your stupid story.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.072
In 1962?

15:41.074 --> 15:42.173
How old are you?

15:42.175 --> 15:43.574
Fat don't crack.

15:43.576 --> 15:47.278
The point is,
you got screwed, dude.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.547
I know every scam
in the book.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.083
Then you could help
get our money back.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.151
All three of you could!

15:53.153 --> 15:56.154
How would you
inconspicuous hausfraus

15:56.156 --> 15:59.257
like to be Cleveland's Angels?

15:59.259 --> 16:01.159
I'm down.
Let's do it.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.162
Na-na, na-na,
na, na, Lucy Liu.

16:04.164 --> 16:07.265
My baby's going to college!

16:07.267 --> 16:09.067
(explosion)

16:09.069 --> 16:10.501
<i>(Charlie's Angels</i> theme plays)

16:10.503 --> 16:11.669
CLEVELAND:
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

16:11.671 --> 16:12.670
<i>there were three little girls</i>

16:12.672 --> 16:16.574
<i>who it wouldn't kill</i>
<i>to miss a meal or two.</i>

16:18.344 --> 16:21.746
<i>And they didn't look good</i>
<i>in athletic clothes.</i>

16:21.748 --> 16:25.149
<i>I rounded them up</i>
<i>and now their big butts</i>

16:25.151 --> 16:26.684
<i>work for me.</i>

16:26.686 --> 16:27.785
(groans)

16:27.787 --> 16:30.955
<i>My name is Cleveland.</i>

16:32.524 --> 16:35.026
Okay, all set.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.661
(over intercom):
Angels?

16:36.663 --> 16:37.895
ALL:
Hi, Cleveland.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.231
What?
We said, "Hi, Cleveland."

16:40.233 --> 16:42.533
Angels? It's Cleveland.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.436
Oh, right. Baby monitors
are only one-way.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.839
We don't want
babies to hear us.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.173
(Cleveland chuckles)

16:49.175 --> 16:50.575
Can you imagine?

16:50.577 --> 16:52.310
Okay, Angels,
here's the plan.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.346
<i>Donna, you're going</i>
<i>to play a sexy siren</i>

16:55.348 --> 16:56.814
<i>who'll flirt with Slim Biggins</i>

16:56.816 --> 16:59.384
<i>to keep his attention</i>
<i>away from the table.</i>

16:59.386 --> 17:02.253
<i>I happen to know he goes</i>
<i>for big-boned middle-aged</i>

17:02.255 --> 17:05.256
<i>black women with kids.</i>

17:05.258 --> 17:07.759
<i>Arianna and Kendra,</i>
<i>you two will be</i>

17:07.761 --> 17:08.626
<i>a couple of high rollers</i>

17:08.628 --> 17:13.231
<i>from Odessa and Corpus Christi,</i>
<i>Texas, respectively.</i>

17:14.366 --> 17:17.301
<i>Kendra, you'll go over</i>
<i>to the table</i>

17:17.303 --> 17:18.403
<i>and start counting cards.</i>

17:18.405 --> 17:22.607
<i>Arianna, you pretend to get</i>
<i>drunk and wait for my signal.</i>

17:22.609 --> 17:26.144
You're kind of thin to be
from Corpus Christi.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.547
Meh-- pitter-patter,
let's get at 'er.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.824
Here we go.

17:39.826 --> 17:44.328
As Kevin Spacey said
to John Travolta,

17:44.330 --> 17:46.531
"I'm all in."

17:47.266 --> 17:48.332
(indistinct chatter)

17:48.334 --> 17:51.469
Before you go,
have I showed you my babies?

17:51.471 --> 17:54.472
The left one is Rollo
and the right one is Roberta.

17:54.474 --> 17:58.309
That's a perky
set of children.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.645
Oh, Slim. (giggles)

18:03.215 --> 18:06.317
Oh, I'm so wasted.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.585
You drunk bitch!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.854
Oh, oh, let me
dry you off.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.923
My gambling trousers!

18:11.925 --> 18:13.224
Hit me...

18:13.226 --> 18:16.461
with that four of clubs.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.473
The four of clubs for 21.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.408
(applause)

18:31.677 --> 18:34.312
What the hell?

18:34.314 --> 18:35.746
I'm sorry, Mr. Biggins,

18:35.748 --> 18:38.349
but I think this woman
was counting cards.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.818
Hello, Russell.
Kendra?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.587
It's been a long time.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.355
You look tremendous.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.391
So, you're still
counting cards?

18:47.393 --> 18:48.593
You two know
each other?

18:48.595 --> 18:50.895
We was business associates.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.330
Russell was
the bureau chief

18:52.332 --> 18:53.831
in Rome when I was all set

18:53.833 --> 18:54.665
<i>to star in Fellini's...</i>

18:54.667 --> 18:57.368
Kendra, we don't have
time for your stupid story.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.471
Oh, so the three of you
are in on this together?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.506
And the bear.
(slurping)

19:01.508 --> 19:04.208
And unless you want her
to tear your ass up,

19:04.210 --> 19:06.577
you'll let us walk out
of this place.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.345
That's right.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.348
She was only
pretending to be drunk.

19:10.350 --> 19:15.353
Cleveland, is,
is rum alcoholic?

19:15.355 --> 19:16.888
(gasps)

19:17.689 --> 19:20.358
You're drunk.
She's drunk.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.727
I'm drunk.
Anyone have any drugs?

19:22.729 --> 19:25.329
I'm going to go find some drugs.

19:26.298 --> 19:30.334
Huh. Looks like you're
not going anywhere.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.303
Not with my money
you're not.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.606
(fingers snapping)
Miss Bazoombas. Ted Lange.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.413
(engine revving)

19:42.415 --> 19:44.715
(tires screeching)

19:48.987 --> 19:51.589
K.F. see you later.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.890
Get in.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.328
Let's go, dude.

20:00.332 --> 20:00.831
(gunshot)

20:00.833 --> 20:02.400
(patrons screaming)

20:09.374 --> 20:11.776
(action movie music)

20:11.778 --> 20:12.843
What are you doing?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.779
We're not going
to clear the river.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.647
We'll never make
it to the road!

20:16.649 --> 20:20.685
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.223
Holt, you're crazy!

20:25.225 --> 20:27.391
(laughs) Crazy like a fish.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.605
(crying)

20:40.607 --> 20:42.673
Good work, Angels.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.980
And after all that,
Holt's car turned
into a submarine,

20:48.982 --> 20:50.648
and we got the hell
out of there.

20:50.650 --> 20:54.852
But the important
thing is, we got your
college money back.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.321
Why? I'm not
going to college.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.757
I'm going to Hollywood!
