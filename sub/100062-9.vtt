00:02.437 --> 00:04.439
Which celebrity likes
their dumps like a truck?

00:04.482 --> 00:06.919
Is it "A," Jerry Seinfeld,

00:06.963 --> 00:08.834
"B," Sugar Ray,

00:08.878 --> 00:10.880
"C," Sisqó,

00:10.923 --> 00:13.448
or "D," Frankie Muniz?

00:13.491 --> 00:15.493
Muniz is a sedan man.

00:15.537 --> 00:16.538
"C," Sisqó.

00:16.581 --> 00:17.843
And you're correct.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.107
The answer
is "C," Sisqó!

00:20.150 --> 00:22.065
Dad, you got it right.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.153
And not just because
the answer's always "C."

00:23.197 --> 00:24.111
I really knew it.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.287
You should be on"Who Wants to be a Millionaire."

00:26.330 --> 00:28.028
No, they'd never pick me for TV.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.507
I got the hair,
but not the pull.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.118
But Mommy wason "Wheel of Fortune."

00:31.161 --> 00:32.815
Oh, Evan.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.122
You need to stop comparing
my life to your father's.

00:35.165 --> 00:38.821
Besides, the Wheel
takes physical skill.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.779
"Millionaire" is just knowing
lots of stuff.

00:40.823 --> 00:41.954
She's got you there,Pops.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.173
Eh, your mom's right.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.740
There's no way
they'd select me.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.264
I'd have to call in,
pass the screening process,

00:47.308 --> 00:48.874
then out of thousands
and thousands of callers,

00:48.918 --> 00:50.441
be one out of only ten chosen.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.313
I'm sorry, boys,
but there's no chance

00:52.356 --> 00:54.184
that I can make it
on the show.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.142
I made it on the show.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.360
I made it on the show!

00:56.404 --> 00:57.448
Hello, Regis.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.885
Hello, Louis.
You made it.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.497
It's time to play "Who Wants
to be a Millionaire."

01:05.804 --> 01:08.155
Those nervous gulps
are good.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.069
Keep them up.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.244
Adds to the tension.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.245
Oh.

Oh, uh, hi.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.443
Uh, my name is Louis Huang.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.227
I'm a father to three boys,

01:37.271 --> 01:39.360
lover of sunflower seedsin salads -- --

01:39.403 --> 01:40.970
Really?
No mention of --

01:41.013 --> 01:42.754
...and a husband to a smartand beautiful wife.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.669
Well, at least
he got one answer right.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.236
And what do you do
for work, Lou?

01:46.280 --> 01:48.238
Oh, I'm a, uh,
business consultant

01:48.282 --> 01:50.240
and owner of, uh,
Cattleman's Ranch,

01:50.284 --> 01:53.113
located just off I-4in East Orlando.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.288
Wow.
A double threat.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.333
Like my girl, Kathie Lee.

01:56.377 --> 01:59.293
Well, actually, I couldn't do itwithout my oldest son, Eddie.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.211
Uhhh, disaster.Look at these spots.

02:04.254 --> 02:07.214
We got to throw these outbefore they infect the knives.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.259
Dude, chill.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.869
You just gotta add rinse agent
to the dishwasher.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.829
This is what brought downthe Sizzler in my hometown.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.397
Good work, Eddie.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.485
Way to protect
that silver.

02:17.528 --> 02:18.573
I got you, Dad.

02:18.616 --> 02:19.791
Eyes on the coin.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.402
In fact, I went through
the books,

02:21.445 --> 02:23.055
and our profits are up 10%.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.492
Really? How?

02:24.535 --> 02:26.015
I-I mean, good.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.973
I saw that if we cut back
on the garnishes,

02:28.017 --> 02:30.367
we can save three centsper plate.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.456
And also I gave the staffsome new incentives.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.197
Like what?Well, every time

02:34.241 --> 02:36.243
a table ordersmore than four appetizers,

02:36.286 --> 02:38.201
I perform my patented belly-roll
for them.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.202
Oh, smart.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.117
I am loving this initiative,
Eddie.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.337
Thanks, Dad. I know you've beenso busy with consulting,

02:43.380 --> 02:44.642
so I've been upping
my game.

02:44.686 --> 02:45.948
I am down for that.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.906
Oh.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.125
Oh.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.822
Eddie, we got a fifth appover here.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.084
Give me a second, Dad.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.260
I gotta do my thing.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.479
Abs and apps!

02:55.523 --> 02:56.524
Together: Abs and apps!

02:56.567 --> 02:58.134
Abs and apps!

02:58.178 --> 02:59.179
Abs and apps!

03:00.354 --> 03:02.399
So, Louis,
you ready to play?

03:02.443 --> 03:03.618
You bet your ass I am!

03:03.661 --> 03:06.186
Family show,
and away we go!

03:07.274 --> 03:08.492
Oh.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.799
Wow.
Regis Philbin.

03:10.842 --> 03:13.018
Regis "I Can Smile While I Talk"Philbin.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.498
Did you know he's spent
more hours on screen

03:14.542 --> 03:15.586
than anybody in history?

03:15.630 --> 03:18.285
Sitting in front of a camera
is not an achievement.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.851
You know
who else does that?

03:19.895 --> 03:21.462
Newborns and safari animals.

03:21.505 --> 03:22.767
Both surprisingly lazy.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.116
Lazy?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.379
Youspend three nights
stalking prey

03:25.422 --> 03:26.423
through the Serengeti.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.729
Serengeti.

03:27.772 --> 03:28.991
Enough distractions.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.732
I need to focus
to prevent your father

03:30.775 --> 03:32.429
from losing a million dollars.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.518
I'm going to signal to him
the answers,

03:34.562 --> 03:36.259
but he's terrible
at charades.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.261
The only sign he knows
is the hand phone.

03:41.003 --> 03:44.180
Between your dad and security
confiscating my purse snacks,

03:44.224 --> 03:45.355
we're off to a rough start.

03:45.399 --> 03:49.054
Apparently, your idol Regis
can't "work"

03:49.098 --> 03:50.621
if there's a crunch sound
in the audience.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.623
As a fellow actor,
I get it.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.060
You need quiet to focus
on your craft.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.801
Craft? This is just
reading words out loud.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.412
You have
three lifelines --

03:58.455 --> 04:02.111
50:50, Ask-the-Audience,
and Phone-a-Friend,

04:02.154 --> 04:03.721
where you can call anyone
for help.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.070
I already got my guy.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.551
Got my encyclopedias,
got my phone.

04:07.595 --> 04:08.813
I should practice.

04:08.857 --> 04:09.858
Quick, Grandma,
say a word.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.122
Something PG.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.863
Garfield.

04:14.906 --> 04:15.994
Mm...

04:16.038 --> 04:17.648
Ah.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.259
Garfield, James A.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.912
20th President
of the United States.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.523
Garfield,
grumpy comic strip cat.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.830
Fastest book hands
in the East.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.789
All I have to is keep
the phone lines clear

04:27.832 --> 04:31.227
and I'll be -- Hi, I'm Alistair Cain
the Science Brain,

04:31.271 --> 04:32.489
and for the next hour only,

04:32.533 --> 04:36.798
you can call and ask me
any science question you want.

04:36.841 --> 04:40.105
All proceeds go
to Florida Public Television.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.760
The conversation
will be electric.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.806
Ooh.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.373
Alistair Cain
the Science Brain?

04:46.416 --> 04:49.419
He's the only person
in the world with a PhD

04:49.463 --> 04:51.203
and a Florida
Kids' Choice Award.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.248
Why now?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.554
I could ask him
to peer review

04:53.597 --> 04:55.730
my fruit fly project
for the science fair.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.300
I would like to peer reviewhis buns.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.477
Great.
Let's play "Millionaire."

05:04.478 --> 05:06.262
First question is
always a gimme.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.524
Little cookie
for the dum-dums.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.048
Louis, for $100,

05:10.092 --> 05:12.486
at what temperature
does water boil?

05:12.529 --> 05:15.227
"A,"
32 degrees Fahrenheit,

05:15.271 --> 05:18.361
"B," 0 degrees Celsius,

05:18.405 --> 05:21.495
"C," 100 degrees Celsius,

05:21.538 --> 05:24.628
or "D," the temperature
of the sun?

05:24.672 --> 05:26.456
Oh, God.
Which is it?

05:26.500 --> 05:28.415
Emery, quick, what's
the temperature of the sun?

05:28.458 --> 05:30.591
Think, Louis.
You know this.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.463
Did you guys not hear
the kettle?

05:33.507 --> 05:35.639
It's been at 100 degrees Celsiusfor three minutes.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.554
Grandma's teaching me
to make bao zi.

05:37.598 --> 05:38.599
It's sick! Look!

05:38.642 --> 05:40.557
Perfect consistency,

05:40.601 --> 05:42.167
like a lamb's scrotum.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.952
Okay, Ma.

05:43.995 --> 05:46.346
Eddie, you've shown a lot
of devotion to cooking lately.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.522
Taking notes?
And footnotes?

05:48.565 --> 05:49.871
Grandma's never written down
a recipe,

05:49.914 --> 05:51.960
so I thought it'd be good
to get them down in case sh--

05:53.570 --> 05:55.267
Just in case.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.704
You know, if you keep up
this initiative,

05:56.747 --> 05:58.706
I may pass the restaurant on
to you one day.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.882
Really?
You'll hand me the baton?

06:00.925 --> 06:03.406
I didn't do rhythmic gymnastics
in college for nothing.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.410
Well, I know it's notthe sun.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.281
How do you know that?
Call Evan.

06:09.325 --> 06:12.197
Regis, I'm gonna gowith "C," 100 degrees Celsius.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.242
Final answer.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.287
You're heating up, Louis,

06:15.331 --> 06:17.638
because that's correct.

06:17.681 --> 06:18.639
Whoa!

06:18.682 --> 06:20.467
Whew!

06:20.510 --> 06:22.033
How did I not know that?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.557
Maybe you got
stage fright.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.775
It's normal
for amateur thespians.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.560
No, you know what it is?

06:26.603 --> 06:28.518
My stolen purse almonds.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.781
I can't thinkwithout my Omega-6s.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.304
Or is it Omega-3s?

06:32.348 --> 06:34.219
Ah, I need
my healthy fats.

06:34.263 --> 06:37.397
Louis Huang just won $100,

06:37.440 --> 06:39.529
and we'll be right back
after this.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.444
Man: That's a break, everyone.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.228
I need to find
a vending machine

06:43.272 --> 06:45.405
before your father loses
all our money.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.015
I'll go with you.
I want to drop off my headshots

06:47.058 --> 06:48.059
around the studio.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.366
"Brooding" for drama.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.672
And "wacky" for comedy.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.066
What took you so long?

06:55.110 --> 06:56.807
This nut bag got stuck
in the coil,

06:56.851 --> 06:59.114
and I had to spend
another 35 cents to get it out.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.463
We're here to win
a million dollars,

07:00.507 --> 07:04.554
not $999,999
and 30 cents.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.600
Wow.
Great math, Mom.

07:06.643 --> 07:07.644
Those nuts really helped.

07:07.688 --> 07:08.515
I'm back, baby.

07:08.558 --> 07:09.646
Sorry, ma'am.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.126
No re-entry
once you leave the stage.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.650
What?We can't go back in?

07:13.694 --> 07:15.609
Hold on. I've got a "shocked"
in here somewhere.

07:15.652 --> 07:19.090
Oh, no. The rest of these
are just "flirty playful."

07:21.136 --> 07:23.443
Oh, I love
a fresh powder.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.096
I feel like
Marie Antoinette.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.229
So, a steakhouse,
eh, Lou?

07:27.272 --> 07:29.536
With all the grills,
it must get hot.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.233
Steaming hot, Regis.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.583
Eddie: Dad, check it out.

07:33.627 --> 07:34.628
I put some burger pieces

07:34.671 --> 07:36.107
inside the baofrom Grandma's recipe.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.109
Half Chinese,
half American.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.634
A fusion dish I callthe Cow Bao.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.679
Nice name.
Rhyme time is dine time.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.551
You mentioned how muchyou liked me taking initiative.

07:44.594 --> 07:47.510
I love it.I thought we could put thison the menu.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.643
No, absolutely not.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.864
Just so you know,
your chair can spin.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.258
Mine can't.
They put a lock on it.

07:56.301 --> 07:59.783
Otherwise, I'd be doing 360s
all day.

07:59.827 --> 08:00.958
I got the wiggles.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.526
Whoa!

08:03.570 --> 08:04.658
It does spin.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.229
Alright, Louis,

08:11.273 --> 08:12.796
for $1,000,

08:12.840 --> 08:17.105
what is the common phrase
for lateral epicondylitis?

08:17.148 --> 08:19.934
Ohh.
"A," Tennis Elbow,

08:19.977 --> 08:22.023
"B," Captain's Knee,

08:22.066 --> 08:25.243
"C," Horizontal Dinosaur,

08:25.287 --> 08:27.855
or "D," Hangover?

08:27.898 --> 08:31.467
Lateral epicondylitis?I've heard that term before.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.383
Wait, Dad, I thought
you wanted me to step up.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.080
What's wrong with putting
my Cow Bao on the menu?

08:36.124 --> 08:37.778
I don't want to messwith what's working.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.606
Cattleman's has been aroundfor five years now.

08:39.649 --> 08:42.260
Well, you know what's
been around for
longer than five years?

08:42.304 --> 08:44.567
China.
Thousands of years of history,

08:44.611 --> 08:46.264
which, if you believe
her stories,

08:46.308 --> 08:47.309
Grandma's been around
for half of.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.093
Eddie,we're a Western steakhouse.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.965
An Asian fusion dish
isn't our brand.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.270
Come on, Dad.
I thought you wanted

08:52.314 --> 08:53.881
to pass me
the restaurant baton.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.144
You're kinda being
a control freak.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.276
No, I'm not being
a control freak.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.627
It's just that runninga restaurant is a business.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.716
Every menu itemhas been thoroughly researched

09:02.759 --> 09:04.587
and taste-tested,
mostly by you.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.719
I have
a photographic tongue.

09:05.762 --> 09:06.807
I remember every taste.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.809
Eddie, I love
your enthusiasm,

09:08.852 --> 09:10.724
but if you're gonna take overthe restaurant,

09:10.767 --> 09:12.726
there's an entire business sideyou have to learn.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.728
I hear you, Pops.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.643
Trent,what's with the wing?

09:16.686 --> 09:18.688
Sorry, boss. I don't think
I can work today.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.081
Lateral epicondylitis.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.212
Ooh.
Bummer.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.823
What's lateral epicurious?

09:22.866 --> 09:23.998
Tennis elbow.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.434
I tried to wrestle
the remote from Trish

09:25.477 --> 09:28.306
and, well, here we are --
lateral epicondylitis.

09:29.394 --> 09:32.484
Trent, you hefty matchstick,you better be right.

09:32.528 --> 09:36.619
Uh, lateral epicondylitisis "A," Tennis Elbow.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.707
Final answer.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.624
Are you Serena Williams?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.452
Because you aced it!

09:43.495 --> 09:44.975
Whoo!

09:45.019 --> 09:47.195
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

09:47.238 --> 09:49.066
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

09:50.807 --> 09:51.808
We gotta get in there.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.505
You go left,
I'll go right.

09:53.549 --> 09:54.942
He'll take one us,
but the survivor

09:54.985 --> 09:57.292
will always rememberthe other.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.774
I've got a better idea.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.123
We're gonna act
our way in.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.300
Me? Act?

10:05.343 --> 10:06.736
I am no monkey.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.955
Honestly, Mom,
I'm surprised you're not

10:07.998 --> 10:09.391
more on board
with acting.

10:09.434 --> 10:10.697
It's basically
manipulation.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.481
You bought yourself
five seconds. Go.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.223
You put on a performance
and control the audience --

10:15.266 --> 10:16.920
manipulation.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.794
Okay,let's act our way in.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.665
I may have to smile.
Don't be alarmed.

10:25.363 --> 10:28.279
So, I need to call Alistair Cainthe Science Brain,

10:28.323 --> 10:30.847
but I have to keep the line openin case Dad calls.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.109
So, can I use your phone?

10:32.153 --> 10:33.763
Yeah, sure.
But remember this

10:33.807 --> 10:35.504
next time I want to borrow
one of your belts.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.332
Hey, kid.
Think fast.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.900
Oh, man.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.163
Just what the world needs --another indoor kid.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.252
Wait, which one is ours?

10:44.295 --> 10:46.733
Why are these phones
identical?

10:46.776 --> 10:49.039
Oh, your mom found
a killer two-for-one deal

10:49.083 --> 10:50.127
on cordless phones.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.259
She got them
and gave me one...

10:51.302 --> 10:53.914
for $5 off full price.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.960
Why is Mommy such a genius?

10:57.004 --> 10:59.136
Louis, for $8,000,

10:59.180 --> 11:01.704
how many hearts
does an octopus have?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.880
Is it "A," two,

11:03.924 --> 11:05.012
"B," three,

11:05.055 --> 11:06.666
"C," eight,

11:06.709 --> 11:07.928
or "D," 30?

11:07.971 --> 11:11.235
Where have I seen
an octopus?

11:12.541 --> 11:14.804
An octopus
has three hearts,

11:14.848 --> 11:16.240
so it represents
the three loves of my life --

11:16.284 --> 11:19.200
my son, CB radio,
and octopus.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.984
That's very strange,Chestnut.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.986
Oh, uh,
lower back tattoos

11:23.030 --> 11:24.771
were actually very masculine
in the '80s.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.076
They called them
"champ stamps."

11:27.556 --> 11:29.123
Pops, I thought
about what you said

11:29.166 --> 11:30.777
and did some research
on why the Cow Bao

11:30.820 --> 11:32.430
will work
at Cattleman's.

11:32.474 --> 11:33.997
It's the year 2000.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.782
Fusion is hot right now.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.654
There's a 63% uptick
in Asian cuisine popularity.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.829
People are learning
that dumplings

11:39.873 --> 11:41.439
aren't just a term
of endearment.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.876
You ran these numbers?

11:42.919 --> 11:44.791
I did. You know how we cut
our square burger patties

11:44.834 --> 11:45.966
to make them circles?

11:46.009 --> 11:47.794
We can use the corner meat
for the Cow Bao.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.752
We're literally
cutting corners.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.667
Okay, but this is
a big swing, Eddie.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.887
I'm not sure our clientelewill be able to adjust.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.845
I thought the same thing.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.891
So I put it to the test.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.283
How much
are these Cow Baos?

11:59.327 --> 12:00.763
$10? $20?

12:00.807 --> 12:01.851
I'd pay a hundred.

12:01.895 --> 12:02.852
This is gold.

12:02.896 --> 12:03.853
Fusion, huh?

12:03.897 --> 12:04.854
I feel so cultured.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.290
The bun catches
the meat juice,

12:06.334 --> 12:07.988
and the name catchesmy imagination.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.816
Gotta put this on the menu,boss.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.168
Okay, sure. Why not?
Let's add it.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.212
♪ Yeah

12:15.256 --> 12:16.953
To think,
this all started

12:16.997 --> 12:19.173
with a little bit of meat
that fell on the floor.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.697
Louis,
we need an answer.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.830
How many hearts does
an octopus have?

12:23.873 --> 12:24.874
Oh, uh, sorry.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.963
Um..."B," three.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.573
Final answer.

12:28.617 --> 12:31.751
This guy might have
three brains because...

12:31.794 --> 12:32.795
he's right!

12:32.839 --> 12:34.405
Wow.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.149
Just follow my lead.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.021
Oh, hi, there, Ronnie.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.414
It's just me, old tiredlighting technician, Gary.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.591
I need to go back thereand fix spotlight 43.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.202
43?

12:48.245 --> 12:50.247
She's trouble, man.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.683
Alright, come in.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.990
Uh, w-who's
your friend here?

12:54.034 --> 12:55.600
My colleague, Esther.

12:55.644 --> 12:56.688
She grew up on a soybean farmand --

12:56.732 --> 12:57.777
Colleague? No, no.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.648
I am the boss.

12:59.691 --> 13:00.867
What George was saying...

13:00.910 --> 13:01.998
Gary....was a lie.

13:02.042 --> 13:02.869
He's my assistant.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.696
I don't have colleagues.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.263
I have employees.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.482
Employees who lie.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.485
What are you doing?

13:10.528 --> 13:11.747
Acting.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.705
I changed the script
because it's not believable

13:13.749 --> 13:15.533
that we're colleagues.
I birthed you.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.100
He was
about to let us in.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.188
Was he?

13:18.232 --> 13:21.017
Honestly, I don't know
why you like acting so much.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.062
It's fun.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.585
It's a waste of time.

13:23.628 --> 13:26.718
Oh. Okay.

13:26.762 --> 13:30.374
Sorry, Ronnie,I just need to get back there

13:30.418 --> 13:32.594
and fix 43 before it becomesa problem for Regis.

13:32.637 --> 13:36.728
Oh, man, this is light 64
all over again.

13:36.772 --> 13:37.860
Come on in.
Yeah.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.122
Hey, wait.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.080
What about her?

13:40.123 --> 13:42.299
She's not with me.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.824
George, wait!

13:44.867 --> 13:45.955
Okay, Marvin's gonna call

13:45.999 --> 13:47.609
from the cellular phonein his car,

13:47.652 --> 13:49.045
and then we'll knowwhich phone is which.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.743
Dad? Regis?

13:51.787 --> 13:53.006
Marvin:
It's Marvin

13:53.049 --> 13:55.965
on the car phone,
with my car Scotch.

13:57.053 --> 13:57.924
Sounds like your problem.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.274
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Hey.

14:00.317 --> 14:03.320
Better do a quick test and see
if the "Millionaire" lifeline

14:03.364 --> 14:05.192
is still getting a signal.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.934
Here's my question,
Science Brain --

14:07.977 --> 14:11.459
that globe work
on your man parts?

14:11.502 --> 14:13.374
Uh...

14:13.417 --> 14:15.463
Mm, question answered.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.160
Grandma,
get off the phone.

14:17.204 --> 14:21.861
After a quick break,Louis will be going for $32,000.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.905
Man: Break time.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.299
Hey, since we have
a second here,

14:25.342 --> 14:26.430
let's meet your family.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.344
Oh, sure thing.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.520
They're right over, uh...

14:29.564 --> 14:30.608
Eddie, come here.

14:31.783 --> 14:34.961
Oh, Louis,
is this your father?

14:35.004 --> 14:36.484
I'm kidding.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.877
So tall.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.139
You must be Eddie.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.096
You help at the restaurant.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.359
Sure do,
Mr...Reeg.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.100
We've got a new fusion dish
I've been working on.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.276
It's a steamed bun
with burger meat inside it --

14:46.320 --> 14:47.234
the Cow Bao.Wow.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.410
I'm hungry
for a Cow Bao now.

14:49.453 --> 14:50.759
Maybe you can mention it
on air.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.021
I love it.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.762
The filler they write for me
is garbage.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.417
Oh, no, that's too kind.We don't need you to do that.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.158
But it'd be great publicity.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.550
How many people watch
this show?

14:59.594 --> 15:00.769
About 28 million.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.553
What?
Daaamn!

15:02.597 --> 15:03.598
Dad, come on.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.469
Uh, better to just keepour heads down

15:05.513 --> 15:06.644
and let our food
do the talking.

15:06.688 --> 15:07.950
We don't want
to over-promise.

15:07.994 --> 15:08.864
Why not?

15:08.908 --> 15:09.996
I don't want
to false advertise.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.345
How is it
false advertising?

15:11.388 --> 15:13.042
Because it's not goingon the menu.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.739
What?

15:14.783 --> 15:16.741
So I was right.
You area control freak!

15:16.785 --> 15:19.657
No, I just don't want somedumb Chinese dish on our menu.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.445
And, uh, we're back.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.930
Folks, due to some
technical difficulties

15:30.973 --> 15:33.671
that don't involve contestants
and their sons,

15:33.715 --> 15:35.151
we'll return after this.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.198
Now, there's nothing
more important

15:38.241 --> 15:40.026
than a parent-child
relationship,

15:40.069 --> 15:43.681
so I want you two
to figure this out.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.379
You've got 90 seconds.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.078
I don't get it.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.340
Are you ashamed
of Chinese food?

15:50.384 --> 15:51.385
Of our culture?

15:51.428 --> 15:52.995
No, of course not.
It's just --

15:53.039 --> 15:54.866
I thought you were being
a control freak,

15:54.910 --> 15:56.520
but it's even worse
than that.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.870
You're a sellout.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.524
I'm sorry.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.004
This can't be done.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.266
Ronnie, look at me.

16:04.615 --> 16:07.140
Do you like salty snacks?

16:09.011 --> 16:10.143
Let me in,
and we'll talk.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.187
I can't.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.235
Fixed the light,
but Regis needs you

16:15.278 --> 16:16.976
to bounce a guy
in Section G.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.716
Crunchy snacks.
I'll cover for you.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.980
My God.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.330
Thanks for coming backto get me. Let's go.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.593
No, I came backbecause I wanted to talk.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.943
Fun fact -- you can talkanywhere. Now let's go.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.249
I'll only let you in
if you admit

16:29.292 --> 16:30.990
acting is not a waste
of time.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.122
It means a lot to me, Mom.
Really.

16:33.166 --> 16:36.125
Acting is not
a waste of time.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.779
Then why do you always
insult it?

16:37.822 --> 16:39.694
I guess I never
liked you acting

16:39.737 --> 16:43.132
because...well,
Inever liked it.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.047
To me, acting is justpeople lying,

16:45.091 --> 16:48.094
which my father did too much ofwhen I was growing up.

16:48.137 --> 16:51.010
He would disappear
for months on end,

16:51.053 --> 16:54.230
only to return smelling likewomen's perfume

16:54.274 --> 16:56.798
and cheap booze.

16:56.841 --> 17:00.845
How could he do that to Mom,to all of us?

17:00.889 --> 17:02.586
I never knew that.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.414
That's because
I made it up.

17:04.458 --> 17:07.069
Did you just...
manipulate me?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.463
No, I just acted you.

17:09.506 --> 17:12.335
Truth is,I know how many people

17:12.379 --> 17:14.511
try to make it as an actor
and fail,

17:14.555 --> 17:16.209
and I don't want youto go through that.

17:17.340 --> 17:20.430
But if you decideacting's what you want,

17:20.474 --> 17:23.085
I can act like
I'm okay with it.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.304
Colleague Gary.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.262
Thanks, Esther.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.959
It's good
to have fake names

17:28.003 --> 17:30.266
should your fatherembarrass us out there.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.401
Louis, let's tackle a problem
I can actually solve.

17:34.444 --> 17:37.404
Are you really ashamed
to serve Chinese food?

17:37.447 --> 17:39.493
No, of course not.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.581
I guess it goes
back to when

17:40.624 --> 17:42.887
I was first startingmy restaurant.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.675
Another strip club,
closed.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.111
It's a shame.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.243
They had a great
iceberg wedge.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.332
Anyway, thought it'd be great
for your restaurant.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.073
Mm. I don't know.
I--

17:54.116 --> 17:56.336
Uh, I know what you're thinking,and I already checked.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.728
The poles
are not structural.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.208
Then I guess it could work.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.297
I'm reallygonna start a restaurant.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.255
What are you gonna call it?

18:02.298 --> 18:03.386
Chinese Wok?
Bamboo Gardens?

18:03.430 --> 18:05.214
Uh, why would you assume --

18:05.258 --> 18:06.215
No, you're right.
Terrible pitches.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.564
No -- Ooh!
Wok Gardens?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.262
No. Garden Bamboo.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.351
I am not openinga Chinese restaurant.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.614
I am opening the most Americanof all restaurants --

18:13.657 --> 18:15.137
a western-themed
steakhouse.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.183
Yee-haw! I love it.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.227
So, are the fortune cookies
gonna look like

18:18.271 --> 18:20.447
little cowboy hats?

18:20.490 --> 18:22.231
I'm not a sellout.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.146
I didn't want people to assumeI'd open a Chinese restaurant

18:24.190 --> 18:26.192
just because I'm Chinese.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.933
I'm American, too.
So are my boys.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.197
I want them to know they're morethan just one thing.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.981
Seems like Eddie got
the message.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.113
What do you mean?

18:34.156 --> 18:36.854
Your boy's making
Chinese cheeseburgers.

18:36.898 --> 18:40.119
He's embracing
being Chinese and American.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.686
A fusion.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.253
Thanks for the talk,Regis.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.690
That's why Regis
asks the questions.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.172
We're back.

18:50.216 --> 18:53.567
Louis, next question
is for $32,000.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.484
What part of a computer
processes memory?

18:57.527 --> 18:59.529
Is it "A," monitor,

18:59.573 --> 19:00.878
"B," RAM,

19:00.922 --> 19:03.359
"C," hard drive,

19:03.403 --> 19:05.405
or "D," gizmos?

19:05.448 --> 19:08.756
Mm. Well, I know monitors, RAMs,and gizmos are all animals,

19:08.799 --> 19:12.194
so...I might need some help
on this.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.284
Regis, I'd like to usemy Phone-a-Friend

19:15.328 --> 19:16.329
to call my son.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.331
Grandma Jenny Huang,
get off the phone!

19:18.374 --> 19:21.290
Shh!I stole this from your mother.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.205
Thank God you're off the phone,

19:23.249 --> 19:24.424
'cause Dad could call
any second.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.991
Hello, Regis,

19:27.035 --> 19:29.298
you're the best part
of my morning!

19:29.342 --> 19:30.517
Woman: Hi, I'm a producer
at Warner Bros.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.866
calling for Emery Huang?

19:31.909 --> 19:33.389
We got
his "brooding" headshot

19:33.433 --> 19:35.348
and want him to audition
for a "Harry Potter" movie.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.306
No, I'm trying to play
"Millionaire"!

19:37.350 --> 19:38.351
Never call again!

19:38.394 --> 19:40.483
My oldest son,
Eddie Huang.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.010
Eddie, I'm sorry.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.491
I'm not ashamed
of being Chinese.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.798
When I started the restaurant,I wanted to be seen as American,

19:50.841 --> 19:53.975
but now I realize it doesn't
have to be one or the other,

19:54.018 --> 19:55.716
and that's a lesson
you didn't even have to learn,

19:55.759 --> 19:58.806
and that makes me happy.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.199
When the time comes,

20:00.242 --> 20:02.462
I'd be honored if you took over
Cattleman's Ranch.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.468
Which is located off the I-4in East Orlando.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.426
And now proudly serves
the Cow Bao.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.908
Louis, beautiful.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.214
Just beautiful.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.259
You have
five seconds left.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.044
Oh, um...Eddie,
what do you think?

20:20.088 --> 20:22.873
It's as you said, Dad --the answer is always "C."

20:22.917 --> 20:25.049
Thanks, son.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.835
Regis, "C," hard drive.
Final answer.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.445
Oh, Lou.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.186
I've enjoyed
our time together,

20:31.230 --> 20:33.014
but the answer is...

20:33.057 --> 20:35.059
"B," RAM.

20:35.103 --> 20:38.237
But hey, more important
than winning $32,000

20:38.280 --> 20:40.282
is winning back your son,
right?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.979
-Totally.
-Totally.

20:46.941 --> 20:49.073
I can't believe you used
your lifeline on Eddie.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.206
His crowning achievement
is sneezing and farting

20:51.250 --> 20:53.426
at the same time
and then calling it a "snart."

20:53.469 --> 20:55.689
Sorry for losinga million dollars, guys.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.908
You were nowhere near
a million.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.476
Don't worry, Louis.
Money isn't everything.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.436
Acting?

21:03.479 --> 21:05.176
Acting.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.700
Seven orders of Cow Baos.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.528
Eddie, you owe us
a belly roll later.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.530
Please, because Chestnut's
been filling in.

21:10.573 --> 21:15.056
You ordered the turf.
I'm providing the surf.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.579
Here you go.

21:16.623 --> 21:17.580
Phone call for you,
Grandma H.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.539
Hello?

21:19.582 --> 21:20.888
Jenny, I'm outside.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.411
I got the globe.
