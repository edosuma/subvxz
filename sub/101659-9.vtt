06:12.997 --> 06:15.124
Prolactin is produced
in the pituitary gland.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.542
The tumor could be secreting it.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.963
You guys know what I mean.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.714
My mother made me
wear a suit and tie

09:08.798 --> 09:10.633
whenever we went
to the pediatrician.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.303
Put on your Sunday best just to get
on the scale and touch your toes.

[chuckles]

09:20.017 --> 09:21.769
The testing confirmed

09:21.852 --> 09:24.814
your tumor is
a hormone-producing prolactinoma.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.567
And the pregnancy is
about six weeks along.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.777
Do you consider yourself gay?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.197
-I don't think that's…
-[Eli] Yes.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.700
Because I am gay.

But you have vaginal intercourse
with your fiancé.

-I think you should leave.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.468
I'm sorry.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.179
That was completely inappropriate.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.057
Our treatment plan for your tumor

10:00.141 --> 10:02.268
depends on your plan for your pregnancy.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.186
So…

10:08.232 --> 10:09.775
We've talked about kids,

10:09.859 --> 10:13.279
but I always figured
that was way down the road.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.449
And not this way.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.701
I always assumed we'd adopt.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.206
I'd have go off T, and stay off.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.627
If Rio doesn't continue the pregnancy,

10:28.461 --> 10:29.545
then what happens?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.631
Your hormone levels
would drop quickly,

10:31.714 --> 10:33.507
which would cause the tumor to shrink.

10:33.591 --> 10:37.011
After that, we'd use medication,
possibly a minor surgery.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.515
I'd like to terminate the pregnancy.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.479
[Enrique] I looked over
all of Zara's labs.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.649
All signs point to her taking
her hypertension medicine regularly.

10:50.358 --> 10:54.737
Her MRIs show
significant ventricular septal thickness,

10:54.820 --> 10:56.322
bad turbulence jet flow.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.283
There's myocardial edema, too.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.244
The ACE inhibitors were a bad call.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.790
Which eventually sent our patient
into cardiogenic shock.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.168
[keyboard clacks, computer beeps]

11:09.251 --> 11:11.379
Why'd you ignore what she was telling us?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.048
[scoffs softly]
I made a medical diagnosis

11:14.131 --> 11:17.593
based on pattern processing
that we're taught in med school,

11:17.676 --> 11:22.640
which involves considering,
you know, race, education,

11:22.723 --> 11:24.642
occupation, BMI.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.478
Always sounded like profiling to me.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.066
[computer beeps]

11:34.777 --> 11:36.320
[man on TV] <i>Yes, we have the rain,</i>

11:36.404 --> 11:38.197
<i>but more impressively, the wind.</i>

11:38.280 --> 11:40.032
<i>That rain's going to be</i>
<i>coming in sideways.</i>

11:40.116 --> 11:42.326
<i>Just take a look at</i>
<i>how the wind increases</i>

11:42.410 --> 11:43.828
<i>as we progress throughout the day.</i>

11:43.911 --> 11:45.579
<i>So, this afternoon,</i>
<i>we're talking about</i>

11:45.663 --> 11:47.164
<i>50-mile-per-hour gusts possible.</i>

11:47.248 --> 11:48.874
Sorry for crashing.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.543
Radiology doesn't have a TV.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.461
[TV continues playing indistinctly]

11:53.045 --> 11:54.880
You like The Weather Channel?

11:56.257 --> 11:57.675
I find it soothing.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.970
Would you like to join me?

12:02.721 --> 12:05.266
<i>And we have more intense</i>
<i>rainfall coming through,</i>

12:05.349 --> 12:07.935
<i>and that's going to</i>
<i>also lead to some flood potential.</i>

12:08.018 --> 12:09.812
<i>All of us are going</i>
<i>to get into the action.</i>

12:09.895 --> 12:10.980
<i>You got the mountains.</i>

12:11.063 --> 12:14.275
Would you mind if I lowered the volume
by four output levels?

12:15.776 --> 12:16.777
Oh.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.821
That would be perfect.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.990
<i>All the areas around here</i>
<i>in Northern California,</i>

12:21.073 --> 12:22.408
<i>Modesto, Stockton, Sacramento.</i>

12:22.491 --> 12:24.994
-[volume decreases]
-<i>The northern part of San Francisco…</i>

12:25.077 --> 12:26.912
[TV continues playing indistinctly]

12:33.419 --> 12:36.046
I find the reflection
on the screen so distracting.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.468
So do I.

12:52.855 --> 12:53.939
Could I

12:56.400 --> 12:57.485
do this?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.155
Nurse paged me.

13:45.574 --> 13:46.784
Is something wrong?

13:48.160 --> 13:49.370
I've changed my mind.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.666
I want to keep the baby.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.506
Since you're continuing the pregnancy,

14:00.589 --> 14:03.008
we'll need to surgically remove
the prolactinoma.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.135
So, you'll cut into his brain?

14:05.970 --> 14:08.347
Our safest option
is to go in through the nasal cavity

14:08.430 --> 14:12.142
in what's known as
a transsphenoidal surgery, TSS for short.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.728
It's less invasive than our other option.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.314
That still sounds dangerous.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.525
I've made up my mind.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.110
Do I get any say in this?

14:24.071 --> 14:26.740
I'm all for us having a family,
but I'm not ready to…

14:26.824 --> 14:28.450
No one's ever ready for kids.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.287
Yesterday, you said that
you never considered getting pregnant,

14:31.370 --> 14:33.789
and now you're willing
to risk your life for it.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.128
When I was about seven,

14:40.254 --> 14:42.172
I had this one refuge.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.719
I'd hang a quilt over a couple chairs

14:46.802 --> 14:49.430
and hide out with my two buds,

14:50.806 --> 14:52.933
Foxie the Fox and Fuzz the Lion,

14:54.226 --> 14:55.311
and I'd imagine,

14:56.228 --> 14:57.229
I was the dad.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.943
And they were my twin little guys,

15:03.819 --> 15:05.446
fraternal, obviously.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.574
We were a family.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.455
When I transitioned,
I put that dream aside.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.625
At least, as far as
them coming from me.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.792
But now…

15:22.755 --> 15:24.256
Whether we planned it or not,

15:25.466 --> 15:26.717
this is our baby.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.017
How soon can you do the surgery?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.728
I'll order an image-guidance MRI
to get things started.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.865
[Claire] Based on the cardiac MRI
and catheterization,

15:49.949 --> 15:51.659
there are two treatment options.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.161
Myectomy, basically open heart surgery,

15:54.244 --> 15:56.455
and alcohol septal ablation,

15:56.538 --> 16:00.376
where we use the alcohol to kill
targeted sections of the heart muscle.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.461
Well, what would you recommend?

16:03.128 --> 16:06.548
The surgery is more invasive,
tougher recovery,

16:06.632 --> 16:08.509
but better efficacy long-term.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.594
The ablation is less dangerous,

16:10.678 --> 16:14.014
but you're more likely to need
further medical interventions.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.684
Now, you call that a recommendation?

16:16.767 --> 16:18.519
There are pros and cons to both.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.646
Uh, you'll need to weigh them.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.064
I'll give you some time.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.567
You always want to take care of people,
Dr. Browne?

16:25.651 --> 16:26.527
Pretty much.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.278
Me, too.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.991
Oh. Well, you run a marijuana dispensary.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.034
It's not all about getting people high.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.705
No, maybe not,
but I'm guessing most of your clientele…

16:37.788 --> 16:40.249
My Great-Aunt Lucy
had pancreatic cancer.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.086
A year, she hung on.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.171
In agony.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.843
Marijuana was the only thing
that helped her eat or sleep.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.303
Doctors didn't give her anything
for the pain?

16:53.887 --> 16:55.514
They suggested ibuprofen.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.143
Now, you know doctors
are 22% less likely

16:59.226 --> 17:01.186
to give pain meds to Black patients

17:01.270 --> 17:03.689
than to white patients
with the same symptoms.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.444
My point is, you and I, we're a lot alike.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.655
We're both strong, Black women
finding our way in the world,

17:11.739 --> 17:14.783
but one of us knows more
about medicine than the other.

17:14.867 --> 17:19.121
So, I'd like to know,
what would you do in my situation?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.461
The open myectomy is a bigger risk

17:25.544 --> 17:28.380
but offers more long-term benefits.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.717
I've made my decision.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.472
I'm with you, Dr. Browne.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.766
Book the myectomy.

17:46.648 --> 17:49.401
Here's the Rio Gutierrez imaging
for your upcoming TSS.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.403
Set that on the table, please.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.366
I, um…

17:57.076 --> 17:59.203
I noted the tumor's suprasellar expansion

17:59.286 --> 18:02.706
and surrounding edema
and splaying of circle of Willis.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.708
That is very helpful.

18:07.878 --> 18:08.962
Bye, Dr. Murphy.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.842
You're safe, Shaun. She's gone.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.219
Not really.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.430
Dr. D'Souza is still in my brain.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.598
I don't like it.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.517
We kissed.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.602
-[Dr. Park] When?
-What?

18:23.685 --> 18:25.604
I have so many thoughts about her,

18:25.687 --> 18:28.148
and I have so many questions
I want to ask Rio.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.691
Wouldn't he get
more pleasure for…

18:29.775 --> 18:32.903
Questions you're not supposed to ask him.
The kiss. When did you kiss?

18:32.986 --> 18:34.822
Last night. In my dream.

18:35.948 --> 18:40.035
If I can't ask questions,
how do I understand?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.121
My… My brain…

18:42.204 --> 18:45.332
My… My brain isn't behaving
the way I want it to.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.583
How do I make it stop?

18:50.921 --> 18:52.840
You're attracted to Dr. D'Souza.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.925
Why does that bother you?

18:57.010 --> 19:01.682
When I was with Carly
and had feelings for Lea,

19:01.765 --> 19:04.351
it meant I was supposed to be with Lea.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.312
What if this means
I'm supposed to be with Dr. D'Souza?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.731
No. You've loved Lea for years.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.693
This is just… attraction.

19:14.194 --> 19:18.031
But shouldn't loving Lea
make it go away?

19:19.158 --> 19:22.369
Relationships would be
a lot easier if it worked that way.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.414
You're feeling guilty.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.834
I say take Lea out for a nice dinner,
something special.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.836
And tell her about my crush.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.796
I need to let Lea know.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.381
-No, definitely not.
-No, you do not.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.885
I want to get your thoughts
on the suprasellar extension of the tumor

19:37.968 --> 19:39.803
-for this TSS.
-You remember Sarah Pepper?

19:39.887 --> 19:41.513
Runs nephrology at S.F. Regional?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.473
Always wears a shawl?

19:43.557 --> 19:46.476
So, during the staff meeting last week,
she fell apart.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.189
Screaming, crying in front
of the whole department. Totally nuts.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.481
Rough day at the office.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.569
Wonder how you'd approach
and resect without getting a CSF leak.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.486
Yeah.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.282
Place a lumbar drain, then infuse saline
and do Valsalva maneuver.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.783
Okay.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.870
Apparently, Pepper's meltdown
was so over the top,

20:04.953 --> 20:06.955
the hospital forced her to take a leave.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.583
-How long?
-Unspecified.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.169
She's always been a little crazy.

20:13.170 --> 20:16.381
Last I checked, eccentric and emotional
didn't qualify as crazy.

20:16.715 --> 20:17.925
Thanks for taking a look.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.682
I read that cisgender people

20:25.766 --> 20:28.769
often reduce transgender people
to their genitalia,

20:28.852 --> 20:30.270
and that that is offensive.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.814
Did I do that to you and Rio?

20:33.482 --> 20:34.483
Yes.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.277
I'm sorry.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.532
Rio will be going into surgery soon.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.245
He's been asking for you.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.163
You haven't been
answering your phone.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.207
Thanks for letting me know.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.089
He is very confusing to me, too.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.424
Rio has worked so hard,

20:59.508 --> 21:02.261
he had a bilateral
subcutaneous mastectomy

21:02.344 --> 21:04.012
and takes hormone
replacement therapy,

21:04.096 --> 21:09.101
but now he is choosing
the most female act.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.897
It's not female if Rio's doing it.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.902
Y… Yes.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.823
And he must have
dealt with a lot of prejudice

21:23.365 --> 21:24.866
during his transition.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.702
I dealt with prejudice.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.870
My brother helped me.
Does he have a brother?

21:30.706 --> 21:32.457
His family doesn't talk to him.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.008
And now Rio is having brain surgery.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.429
He is very brave.

21:46.596 --> 21:47.806
You can stay here.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.063
I have a patient, Zara Norton.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.941
We, uh… We diagnosed her with HOCM.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.234
I saw the file.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.321
Dr. Guerin expressed some concerns

22:02.404 --> 22:05.490
about my initial handling
of the case in the ER.

22:06.908 --> 22:10.662
He thinks I stereotyped her,
based on her race.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.080
Do you think you did?

22:14.249 --> 22:15.542
She was crashing.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.420
I had to make a call.
I didn't have a lot to go on.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.591
Glassman came to see me this morning.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.927
Someone told him
I'm unstable and need help.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.512
Any idea where he heard that?

22:29.598 --> 22:30.849
I asked for help. You can, too.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.143
You're a resident.
No one cares if you need help.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.313
I got this job in part

22:36.396 --> 22:39.608
because my main competition,
a man, backed me.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.527
The second anyone thinks
I can't handle this…

22:42.611 --> 22:43.820
No one is gonna think that…

22:43.904 --> 22:45.906
They will if you keep
telling them I'm a mess.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.616
You have PTSD.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.576
You shouldn't be ashamed.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.537
Says the women
who just profiled a Black female patient.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.208
You judged her,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.503
just like people will judge me

22:59.586 --> 23:01.838
and whisper that I've always
been a little intense,

23:01.922 --> 23:03.882
so no wonder I was asked to step down.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.051
[sighs softly]

23:08.637 --> 23:09.846
Nobody needs to know.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.057
[scoffs]

23:12.641 --> 23:13.725
Exactly.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.854
You tell me that it doesn't matter.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.940
You tell me everyone will understand,

23:20.023 --> 23:22.025
and then you tell me
to keep it to myself.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.402
Should I be ashamed,
or shouldn't I be?

23:25.904 --> 23:28.865
All right, Ms. Norton,
time to head to pre-op.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.828
[Zara] What's in the bag, handsome?

23:32.911 --> 23:35.872
I like to know what goes into my body.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.793
Uh, cefazolin. It's a prophylactic
antibiotic we give before surgeries.

23:39.876 --> 23:40.877
Makes sense.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.549
Hey, what was the med y'all gave me
when I first got here to the ER?

23:46.299 --> 23:48.677
Enalaprilat. It's an ACE inhibitor.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.137
Isn't that for hypertension?

23:50.220 --> 23:51.054
Mm-hmm.

23:52.597 --> 23:55.892
But I thought I already told y'all
I was on meds for my blood pressure.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.769
You did.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.354
So, you figured I needed more?

24:02.774 --> 24:04.192
Or did you not believe me?

24:18.248 --> 24:19.332
I'm sorry.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.296
You must be scared.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.549
You shouldn't have to be scared alone.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.426
[sniffles]

24:29.801 --> 24:31.011
I love you.

24:31.761 --> 24:32.971
I love you, too.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.019
Eli.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.355
I can't see you.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.524
I'm right here, babe.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.277
Can you follow this with your eyes?

24:50.071 --> 24:51.406
It keeps disappearing.

24:51.489 --> 24:52.699
You've lost peripheral vision.

24:52.782 --> 24:54.743
The tumor is impinging
on the optic fibers.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.745
We can't perform the TSS surgery.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.753
[Dr. Lim] With the tumor's
continued growth,

25:04.836 --> 25:08.048
the best remaining option
is the open pterional craniotomy.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.426
But it is higher risk
with a lengthier recovery.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.055
All of which is on top of the potential
for gender dysphoria

25:15.138 --> 25:16.348
during pregnancy.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.433
Is that still a concern?

25:20.393 --> 25:22.520
I think back to before I started taking T,

25:23.438 --> 25:25.065
how terrible that felt.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.861
The thought of feeling that
all over again…

25:33.615 --> 25:36.034
We could go back to the original plan.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.038
You mean terminate the pregnancy?

25:41.248 --> 25:43.083
The tumor should shrink on its own.

25:46.753 --> 25:50.173
After everything you've done
to get where you are in your life,

25:51.007 --> 25:54.427
it's scary to think about doing something
that would put that at risk.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.597
[sighs]

25:58.139 --> 26:00.058
This is my next step.

26:01.226 --> 26:04.312
I'm ready to take it, even if I'm scared.

26:07.023 --> 26:09.234
You have to take risks sometimes, Dr. Lim.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.245
Thank you.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.914
Shouldn't you be prepping Zara
for surgery?

26:22.998 --> 26:23.999
It's canceled.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.918
She wants to be transferred
to a different hospital.

26:28.461 --> 26:31.881
One where she won't be
"racially profiled into heart failure."

26:34.676 --> 26:35.677
[sighs softly]

26:40.390 --> 26:42.809
Shaun, you okay?

26:45.729 --> 26:48.440
[Shaun] I am having thoughts
I don't want to have.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.359
Both Park and Jordan
say I shouldn't tell you.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.446
But you're going to, aren't you?

26:56.656 --> 26:58.116
Yes, I am.

26:58.199 --> 26:59.951
I have a work crush.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.454
Also, my patient is a pregnant trans man…

27:02.537 --> 27:03.955
Okay, one at a time, Shaun.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.624
About this… crush?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.752
Her name is Dr. Cintia D'Souza.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.670
She is a second-year radiology resident.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.131
Last night, I dreamed we were
in the Residents' Lounge,

27:13.214 --> 27:14.424
watching The Weather Channel,

27:14.507 --> 27:16.509
-and then we started kissing…
-Okay, I got it.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.554
Are you mad?

27:20.138 --> 27:22.557
Park and Jordan were right.
I shouldn't have told you.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.602
No. I'm not mad.

27:25.685 --> 27:29.022
A little surprised, but that's okay.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.902
I'm still attracted

27:34.569 --> 27:35.987
to other guys sometimes.

27:36.738 --> 27:37.822
N… No.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.075
No. What? Who?

27:40.158 --> 27:41.368
-It doesn't matter.
-Who?

27:42.494 --> 27:46.581
There… Okay, there is
this one physical therapist…

27:46.664 --> 27:47.749
N… No.

27:48.416 --> 27:49.250
No.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.627
No.

27:54.214 --> 27:58.051
What if we're attracted to other people

27:58.134 --> 28:01.554
because there is something wrong
with our relationship?

28:03.348 --> 28:06.643
You're not planning
on kissing Dr. D'Souza in real life?

28:06.726 --> 28:07.644
No.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.646
Or working late with her,

28:09.729 --> 28:11.773
doing some X-rays alone,

28:11.856 --> 28:15.193
where you might end up
leaning over the same light box.

28:15.276 --> 28:17.695
We don't use light boxes anymore.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.452
And I don't plan to work late with her.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.956
Then I don't think either of us
has anything to be worried about.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.791
[inhales sharply]

28:40.427 --> 28:42.846
I have to go prep
for a pterional craniotomy.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.272
I'm Dr. Glassman,
president of the hospital.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.275
Unless you're here
to drive me to S.F. Regional,

28:55.358 --> 28:56.860
you can head right back on out.

28:58.278 --> 29:01.239
I apologize for your experience
in the emergency room.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.450
That's mighty white of you.

29:04.743 --> 29:05.744
[sighs softly]

29:06.661 --> 29:09.622
I don't recommend
that you transfer to S.F. Regional,

29:09.706 --> 29:11.291
or any other hospital,
for that matter.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.501
I'm sure they got
the same fancy equipment,

29:13.585 --> 29:15.962
same shiny sets
of diplomas y'all got here,

29:16.045 --> 29:18.256
and maybe a few less racist doctors.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.177
Well, apparently,
that doesn't seem to be the case.

29:22.677 --> 29:26.514
I pulled data on comparable hospitals
within 100 miles,

29:27.515 --> 29:30.602
did numbers on surgical outcomes

29:30.685 --> 29:34.522
and patient satisfaction,
aggregated by race.

29:35.231 --> 29:39.444
Apparently, we're doing well,
comparatively.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.909
Your argument is that
your hospital may be racially biased,

29:45.992 --> 29:48.536
but it's less racially biased
than these other hospitals?

29:50.330 --> 29:51.831
Yeah. Pretty much.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.459
Stay at St. Bonaventure,

29:54.542 --> 29:58.755
the president of the hospital will
monitor your care every step of the way.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.341
For whatever it's worth,

30:02.550 --> 30:04.385
I don't think you can do better than that.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.065
She's gonna stay, on one condition.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.734
That you're off the team.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.789
[Dr. Lim] Dr. Park,
please open Sylvian fissure.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.874
[Dr. Park] Arachnoid knife
and Rhoton dissector.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.793
[monitor beeping]

30:36.876 --> 30:39.295
[Shaun] Tumor is visible.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.215
What makes someone a man?

30:44.092 --> 30:46.594
I thought it was just the chromosomes,

30:46.678 --> 30:48.680
but that must not be it,

30:48.763 --> 30:51.266
which makes things
confusing and difficult,

30:51.349 --> 30:53.226
and I know Rio
was uncomfortable when he…

30:53.309 --> 30:54.936
Life is uncomfortable.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.857
It hits you with tough situations
and you muscle through them.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.025
I see a tiny bleed in the circular sinus.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.318
Pack it with Floseal.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.451
-[alarm beeping]
-Someone give me an update.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.996
[Dr. Park] We got a drop
in end tidal CO2 and oxygen sat.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.331
[Dr. Lim] See any evidence
of exposed air cells?

31:15.415 --> 31:18.418
[Shaun] No. But waxing
bone edges just to be safe.

31:18.501 --> 31:21.921
But the tumor thinned
the sellar floor and sphenoid wall.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.632
[Dr. Lim] Making it permeable to oxygen.

31:25.925 --> 31:27.343
It's an air embolism.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.846
-[alarms beeping]
-[Jordan] BP's dropping.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.726
Dr. Lim, what should we do?

31:39.647 --> 31:42.066
[beeping fades,
voices speaking indistinctly, echoing]

31:44.402 --> 31:45.904
[alarm beeping]

31:45.987 --> 31:47.405
[voices echoing]

31:49.240 --> 31:51.242
-[beeping continues]
-[voices echoing]

31:57.749 --> 31:58.791
[Dr. Lim] Saline gauze,

31:58.875 --> 32:01.669
tilt the table to eliminate
the negative air pressure gradient,

32:01.753 --> 32:02.921
and place a central line.

32:04.255 --> 32:07.216
This will stop the air leak
and allow us to access the air bubble.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.719
[Dr. Park]
Inserting Bunegin air-aspirating cath.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.933
[Shaun] You are 2 centimeters
from the superior vena cava.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.187
Aspirate the right atrium
until you don't see any more air bubbles.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.483
[beeping slows]

32:29.530 --> 32:30.865
Nice save, Dr. Lim.

32:32.408 --> 32:33.826
Let's get this tumor out.

32:33.910 --> 32:37.664
[Dr. Andrews] <i>Make your transverse</i>
<i>aortotomy with Potts scissors, Dr. Wolke.</i>

32:38.957 --> 32:42.043
[Asher] <i>Extending the muscular incision</i>
<i>down to the mid-ventricle.</i>

32:42.794 --> 32:44.420
[Dr. Andrews]
There's the myectomy site.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.882
There's the aberrant muscle bundle.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.533
Get her off bypass,

33:14.200 --> 33:15.410
see how she does.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.671
[monitor beeping]

33:28.548 --> 33:29.966
How's the cardiac output?

33:31.134 --> 33:32.927
[Enrique] Reduced and insufficient.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.681
Low output could mean
we need to further reduce the septum.

33:36.764 --> 33:38.599
Unless it means that
we reduced it too much.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.351
Damaged the cardiac
electrical conductors

33:40.435 --> 33:42.061
-that control the heart rate.
-[beeping]

33:42.145 --> 33:44.022
She's having third-degree heart block.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.398
Enrique's right.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.275
We took too much muscle.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.318
[Dr. Andrews] Put her back on bypass.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.362
We could augment the wall
with a bovine patch.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.364
Still wouldn't insulate
the electrical system.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.743
She'd still be at risk of complete
heart block and cardiac arrest.

33:59.912 --> 34:02.540
[Claire] <i>We could insert</i>
<i>a dual chamber pacer.</i>

34:02.623 --> 34:05.293
<i>She won't need the conduction system</i>
<i>in the wall of her heart</i>

34:05.376 --> 34:06.544
<i>to control her heart rate.</i>

34:09.213 --> 34:10.298
Let's go!

34:15.928 --> 34:17.346
How was the craniotomy?

34:17.722 --> 34:18.973
It went well.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.558
The patient is in recovery.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.022
Your text said you have good news.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.775
And by good news, I mean
bad news for Dr. D'Souza.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.527
Plenty of great stuff to crush a crush.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.488
First observation,

34:34.655 --> 34:36.157
she smells like cinnamon.

34:37.784 --> 34:38.785
Mm.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.747
Which is more puzzling than irritating.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.333
Actually kind of nice.
Which is obviously not helpful.

34:46.125 --> 34:49.170
Oh, okay. She does this
weird self-grooming gesture

34:49.253 --> 34:51.255
where she tucks her hair behind her ear.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.926
And then sorta massages her ear.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.428
Also n… not helpful.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.180
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [chuckles]

34:59.680 --> 35:00.681
Mm-hmm.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.600
Okay. At the salad bar,

35:03.059 --> 35:06.145
she used the cucumber tongs
to reach for the cucumbers,

35:07.355 --> 35:08.856
and then the tomatoes.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.653
And the olives.

35:14.570 --> 35:15.571
[sighs]

35:15.988 --> 35:17.281
And the pickles.

35:18.991 --> 35:20.076
-Ugh.
-Mm.

35:20.993 --> 35:22.078
Mm-hmm.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.153
Hey.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.197
Hey.

36:00.575 --> 36:01.993
I can see all of you.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.624
How'd… How'd we do?

36:09.041 --> 36:12.461
Great. We got all of the mass,
vision is restored.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.673
You have every reason
to expect a full recovery

36:16.549 --> 36:17.967
and a healthy pregnancy.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.847
We're gonna be dads.

36:22.930 --> 36:23.931
[both chuckle]

36:26.642 --> 36:27.643
Are you ready?

36:30.271 --> 36:32.398
I've never been a pregnant man before.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.111
You'll always be the best man
that I've ever known.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.114
[chuckles]

36:51.542 --> 36:52.960
Came to see how you were doing.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.756
Dr. Andrews told me you was the one
who figured out how to save me.

37:01.677 --> 37:04.096
Still don't change
what went down earlier, though.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.896
When I got to med school,

37:15.608 --> 37:18.819
people took one look at me and they
thought they knew exactly who I was.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.739
Black girl on financial aid.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.243
She must not be that smart.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.954
She must have gotten a lot of breaks.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.790
She'll probably need a lot more.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.088
And I worked…

37:38.756 --> 37:41.384
I worked so hard

37:41.467 --> 37:42.677
to prove them wrong,

37:43.261 --> 37:44.929
that I wasn't who they thought I was,

37:45.012 --> 37:47.139
that I deserved to be there, that I…

37:47.682 --> 37:49.183
[sighs] that I fit in.

37:55.189 --> 37:57.108
When you came into the ER,

37:59.986 --> 38:01.904
loud and messy,

38:04.448 --> 38:06.075
I saw… [sighs]

38:06.534 --> 38:11.539
I saw everything
I have tried hard not to be.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.461
And I think it made me angry.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.136
[voice breaking]
And I'm ashamed of that.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.390
And I'm really sorry.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.021
I used to be that way.

38:38.024 --> 38:41.444
But I got tired of working that hard
to make white people comfortable.

38:57.543 --> 38:59.170
You two heading out for the night?

38:59.879 --> 39:00.880
[exhales sharply]

39:02.506 --> 39:03.591
We sure are.

39:04.216 --> 39:06.218
How did the craniotomy go, Shaun?

39:06.927 --> 39:09.764
-[sniffs]
-Did you guys get all the prolactinoma?

39:10.890 --> 39:11.807
Yes.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.935
Is that cafeteria salad?

39:16.937 --> 39:18.356
Are there pickles in there?

39:20.566 --> 39:21.567
Did you want some?

39:21.650 --> 39:24.070
You know, I'm good. Thank you.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.363
Shaun, did you…

39:26.489 --> 39:28.699
-No, thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.999
It does help to focus
on her irresponsible salad bar practices

39:37.083 --> 39:38.501
and dietary preferences.

39:38.584 --> 39:41.545
I've got a ton of strategies
to manage discomfort.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.172
So do I.

39:46.634 --> 39:47.635
-Hey.
-[Dr. Lim] Hey.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.679
To replenish your supply,

39:51.555 --> 39:52.556
and a peace offering.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.351
I wasn't aware we were at war.

39:56.310 --> 39:59.730
Well, seemed like my gossip
about Pepper kind of landed wrong.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.400
Bad day.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.318
Sorry to crash the party.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.488
Dr. Glassman wanted me
to show this to you two.

40:09.156 --> 40:12.701
I asked Lea to run some numbers
on various metrics by race,

40:12.785 --> 40:14.787
and the results are not great,

40:14.870 --> 40:16.872
especially when it comes
to pain management.

40:16.956 --> 40:20.626
We are under-treating
African-American and Latinx patients

40:20.709 --> 40:22.628
by a considerable margin.

40:23.003 --> 40:25.131
I think I need a little
of that peace offering.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.215
Help yourself.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.551
-Anyone else?
-No. Thank you.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.471
Uh… me, neither.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.563
I…

40:43.023 --> 40:44.650
started taking sertraline.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.611
For PTSD.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.196
[sighs]

40:50.406 --> 40:51.490
Sorry to hear that.

40:53.492 --> 40:54.702
You doing okay?

40:57.913 --> 40:58.914
Not really.

41:00.833 --> 41:01.834
But I'm

41:03.127 --> 41:04.211
working on it.

41:05.588 --> 41:06.672
Okay.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.720
Dr. Browne, good work.

41:15.097 --> 41:16.182
Thank you.

41:25.858 --> 41:26.942
[sighs]

41:43.292 --> 41:44.793
I apologized to Zara.

41:48.255 --> 41:52.092
She pointed out I spent med school

41:53.302 --> 41:55.513
trying to make white people comfortable.

41:59.683 --> 42:00.768
I mean, she's right.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.270
It wasn't just med school.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.274
Exhausting, isn't it?

42:10.486 --> 42:11.904
But we had to do it, right?

42:13.531 --> 42:14.615
To be here?

42:32.258 --> 42:34.260
