In the end,
you did the right thing --

09:52.309 --> 09:54.642
just like Finn would have.

09:54.644 --> 09:56.878
Uh...
good job, grass me.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.479
But I'm <i>not</i> you.

09:58.481 --> 10:00.882
It's clear
that I'm someone else.

10:00.884 --> 10:03.985
So from now on,
call me...

10:03.987 --> 10:06.454
Fern the human.

Hello.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.494
Excuse me.
Fern needs this bike.

[ Tires squeal ]

10:15.332 --> 10:16.231
No!

10:16.233 --> 10:19.167
Starchy's midlife crisis!

10:19.169 --> 10:20.835
Hey, Fern, wait!

10:20.837 --> 10:21.903
Let him go, man.

10:21.905 --> 10:23.705
Trust me.

10:37.586 --> 10:39.554
Awesome!
