WEBVTT

00:01.813 --> 00:03.314
Whoa, look at you.

00:03.316 --> 00:05.082
Wait, are we doing Formal Fridays now?

00:05.084 --> 00:06.550
I need to iron my gloves.

00:06.552 --> 00:08.166
Is that your tie from Catholic school?

00:08.177 --> 00:09.987
Bet it still smells
like your old cologne...

00:09.989 --> 00:12.022
Raw by Stone Cold Steve Austin.

00:12.033 --> 00:13.618
What? You know, it's a tie.

00:13.629 --> 00:15.162
You know, maybe I'm tired of T-shirts,

00:15.173 --> 00:17.115
and I want to feel like I'm choking.
Maybe it's a different reason.

00:17.126 --> 00:19.594
- Who cares?
- Well, my polite conversation starter

00:19.596 --> 00:21.396
certainly touched a nerve.

00:21.398 --> 00:24.699
- Honestly, not that invested.
- I am deeply invested.

00:24.701 --> 00:26.668
And I'll figure out
why you're wearing this getup

00:26.670 --> 00:28.203
when I get home from school.

00:28.205 --> 00:30.105
You have been warned.

00:30.107 --> 00:31.272
You've been warned.

00:35.612 --> 00:37.679
Matthew, get in here.

00:37.681 --> 00:39.914
Is it a mouse? Can we keep it?

00:39.916 --> 00:42.317
- Look at this.
- Oh, my God.

00:42.319 --> 00:44.085
Matt Bomer's clothes are sopping wet,

00:44.087 --> 00:45.954
but his hair is still perfect. How?

00:45.956 --> 00:48.189
No, I'm talking about the fact
that there is pornography

00:48.191 --> 00:49.824
- on my son's wall.
- He's fully clothed.

00:49.826 --> 00:51.359
He knows what he's doing.

00:51.361 --> 00:55.263
Vince, you need to accept
the fact that Michael is gay.

00:55.265 --> 00:57.298
Uh, I more than accept it, I love it.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.034
Do you have any idea what a mic drop

00:59.036 --> 01:02.237
"gay, half-Indian son" is in any
argument where I'm deemed offensive.

01:02.239 --> 01:04.572
How can you not see that
Michael's too young for this?

01:04.574 --> 01:05.940
Michael's growing up.

01:05.942 --> 01:07.809
I mean, you've had
"the talk" with him, right?

01:07.811 --> 01:09.711
Yeah, you mean the talk

01:09.713 --> 01:11.513
about why I deduct taxes
from his allowance?

01:11.515 --> 01:13.474
Vince, this is part of being a dad.

01:13.485 --> 01:16.551
You're good at lame jokes and saying
the name of every sign you drive by.

01:16.553 --> 01:18.037
Maybe you'd be great at this.

01:18.048 --> 01:20.422
All right, okay. All right,
I'll have "the talk" with him.

01:20.424 --> 01:22.691
But in the meantime,
this has got to come down.

01:22.693 --> 01:26.394
Isn't it just a little creepy
that he looks exactly like me?

01:26.396 --> 01:29.297
Well, maybe not the hair or the face...

01:29.299 --> 01:31.399
or the eyes or the body or the charisma,

01:31.401 --> 01:33.168
- income level.
- Okay.

01:36.936 --> 01:40.115
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:47.484 --> 01:49.013
- I told you
I'd find you, Matthew,

01:49.024 --> 01:51.519
but why would you wear a tie
to a Connecticut Muffin?

01:51.521 --> 01:54.556
He's on a date with a nun?
The man likes a challenge.

01:54.558 --> 01:57.258
It's just not fair.
It's like I don't exist.

01:57.260 --> 01:59.894
I've been carrying this shame
for years, Sister Timothy.

01:59.896 --> 02:01.347
And you just let it happen to me.

02:01.358 --> 02:03.331
There was nothing I could do.
Don't blame me.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.499
Blame the system.

02:04.501 --> 02:07.001
You should've stood up to the system.
I was just a kid.

02:07.003 --> 02:08.402
- Aha!
- Michael?

02:08.405 --> 02:09.838
How much did you hear?

02:09.840 --> 02:11.940
Enough to poison my love of nuns.

02:11.942 --> 02:15.143
"Sound of Music," "Sister Act,"
"Sister Act 2"...

02:15.145 --> 02:17.011
You're supposed to be Motown-loving,

02:17.013 --> 02:18.299
Nazi-hating heroes.

02:18.310 --> 02:20.115
How could you let
this happen to my uncle?

02:20.117 --> 02:21.950
Your uncle did this to himself.

02:21.952 --> 02:23.952
Blaming the victim? Wow.

02:23.954 --> 02:26.087
Was it Jesus' fault He was crucified?

02:26.089 --> 02:29.157
And that's famously complicated,

02:29.159 --> 02:31.760
whereas your uncle's situation
is quite straightforward.

02:31.762 --> 02:33.661
He skipped too many classes to graduate

02:33.663 --> 02:36.531
from Holy Martyrs Bleeding Feet Academy.

02:36.533 --> 02:39.467
Oh, well, then that's
different than what I thought.

02:41.705 --> 02:43.638
Explain, please.

02:45.609 --> 02:47.675
Who do you think you are,
taunting my son?

02:47.677 --> 02:50.311
You're not even that cut.

02:53.717 --> 02:54.883
This better be good, Vince,

02:54.894 --> 02:56.384
I'm trying to win back my paycheck.

02:56.386 --> 02:59.521
I'm just wondering if you ever
had "the talk" with Michael?

02:59.523 --> 03:01.117
"The Talk"? Yes, Michael loved it.

03:01.128 --> 03:02.157
Really?

03:02.159 --> 03:04.025
Oh, yeah, Sharon Osbourne
will say anything.

03:04.027 --> 03:05.960
Not "The Talk" on CBS.

03:05.962 --> 03:08.703
- The sex talk in real life.
- Oh, God, no.

03:08.714 --> 03:10.594
But didn't he have sex
ed in middle school,

03:10.605 --> 03:12.672
you know, where the girls go
learn about pregnancy,

03:12.683 --> 03:14.235
and the boys just
throw bananas at each other?

03:14.237 --> 03:15.696
Yeah, but Ohio's so conservative

03:15.707 --> 03:18.688
that they teach you that condoms
actually increase your chance of STDs.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.985
Well, yeah, but I mean, until
condoms are 100% effective,

03:20.996 --> 03:23.188
what's the point
in using them at all, right?

03:23.199 --> 03:25.680
As a mother, as a nurse, and as a human,

03:25.682 --> 03:29.352
I beg you, please read a book
before you teach my son about sex.

03:29.363 --> 03:30.619
Any book. It can have pictures.

03:30.630 --> 03:32.597
Mm, don't need to.

03:32.608 --> 03:35.014
I wrote the book, babe.
Anyway, thanks for nothing.

03:35.025 --> 03:37.414
Okay, you're welcome
for raising our son alone

03:37.425 --> 03:39.425
for 15 year...

03:39.462 --> 03:41.295
It's a good thing
your husbands are all dead.

03:42.337 --> 03:44.314
This is the saddest mystery
I've solved since...

03:44.325 --> 03:46.619
"Why does my mom have
a wedding dress in her closet?"

03:46.621 --> 03:48.881
Sister Timothy makes it sound
like I never went to class,

03:48.892 --> 03:50.780
but it was just one... American history.

03:50.791 --> 03:53.670
There was just so much reading. My
girlfriend couldn't do it all for me.

03:53.681 --> 03:56.762
Don't worry... lots of smart people
didn't graduate high school.

03:56.764 --> 03:59.332
- Joan of Arc, Anne Frank.
- That's true.

03:59.334 --> 04:00.924
Everything turned out fine for them.

04:00.935 --> 04:02.635
Okay, maybe you do
need more high school.

04:02.637 --> 04:05.304
I know. Ever since Vince
almost moved to Florida,

04:05.306 --> 04:08.341
I've been wondering who else would
give me a job without a diploma.

04:08.343 --> 04:10.977
I can't be an escort.
I would keep falling in love.

04:10.979 --> 04:13.079
Wait, but how did Vince not know?

04:13.081 --> 04:15.348
The nuns let me walk
so I wouldn't shame my family.

04:15.350 --> 04:17.511
If Vince found out now,
I know he'd freak out.

04:17.522 --> 04:18.834
Well, this is New York.

04:18.845 --> 04:20.925
If I was able to get a fake ID
to see "Girls Trip,"

04:20.935 --> 04:22.154
we can get you a diploma.

04:22.156 --> 04:24.690
No, I don't want to cheat.
Cheating is a sin.

04:24.692 --> 04:26.692
I'm already way in the red
for premarital sex.

04:26.694 --> 04:28.339
Look, if it really means
that much to you,

04:28.350 --> 04:29.803
why don't you just get your GED?

04:29.814 --> 04:32.131
Yeah, that's easy for you to
say... you know what that is.

04:32.133 --> 04:34.000
It's the high-school equivalency exam.

04:34.002 --> 04:36.936
It's for prisoners and child actors.

04:36.938 --> 04:38.537
Oh, here.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.406
Look, they're offering the test
next week.

04:40.408 --> 04:42.675
- I'll help you prepare.
- Michael, thank you.

04:42.686 --> 04:44.705
I'm finally gonna graduate high school.

04:44.716 --> 04:46.021
What's my senior prank gonna be?

04:46.032 --> 04:48.236
When Vince graduated, they
robbed the principal's house.

04:48.247 --> 04:51.250
- Priya got shot.
- I know. It's her one good story.

04:51.252 --> 04:53.152
Let's hit the books.

04:56.124 --> 04:58.157
Allison Williams.

04:58.159 --> 05:02.395
I'd always thought we'd
be friends, but not like this.

05:02.397 --> 05:05.531
Hey, buddy. So can we talk for a second?

05:05.533 --> 05:07.433
Look, I, uh, noticed you redecorated,

05:07.435 --> 05:09.467
and I thought this poster
would be a little cooler

05:09.478 --> 05:11.701
than the one of your dad's
identical twin... Matt Bomer.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.206
- Oh, God, no.
- Yeah, I just think the poster

05:14.208 --> 05:16.542
of the guy from the show
"Suits" is a bit unsuitable...

05:16.544 --> 05:18.511
For a child's bedroom.

05:18.513 --> 05:20.079
Matt Bomer is "White Collar."

05:20.081 --> 05:21.747
Princess Meghan is from "Suits."

05:21.749 --> 05:23.749
Exactly. The man's not even on "Suits."

05:23.751 --> 05:25.885
However, this guy here,
star of Peter Pan.

05:25.887 --> 05:27.853
Plus, maybe this is you
rubbing off on me,

05:27.855 --> 05:29.121
he's hot.

05:29.123 --> 05:31.023
I agree. I mean, a woman who plays a boy

05:31.025 --> 05:33.292
that never grows up is
a much more appropriate choice

05:33.294 --> 05:35.928
for a kid my age
than a beautiful role model.

05:35.930 --> 05:37.096
Thank you.

05:37.098 --> 05:38.831
Do those words make this over?

05:38.833 --> 05:40.766
Yeah. Wow, that was
easier than I expected.

05:40.768 --> 05:42.068
Cool.

05:42.070 --> 05:43.803
But if you ever wanted to talk

05:43.805 --> 05:45.738
- about this region...
- I don't.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.507
- Okay, but when you do...
- I won't, ever.

05:48.509 --> 05:52.344
Cool. Then I'll let you two playas play.

05:53.748 --> 05:55.656
Oh, my God.

05:55.667 --> 05:56.744
So how'd it go?

05:56.755 --> 05:58.766
Did you do the rap about
consent that I taught you?

05:58.777 --> 06:00.986
Didn't need it. He said he
wasn't ready for "the talk."

06:00.988 --> 06:03.355
He even agreed that he was
too young for the Bomer poster.

06:03.357 --> 06:05.524
Man, I am good at this parenting stuff.

06:05.526 --> 06:07.393
I should probably write a book.

06:07.395 --> 06:10.162
"Act Like a Cool Guy, Think Like a Dad."

06:11.666 --> 06:12.798
Amazing.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.167
Yeah. Hmm.

06:18.519 --> 06:20.787
Hey, guys.

06:20.789 --> 06:22.955
Getting in some lunch action?

06:22.957 --> 06:24.624
Nom, nom, nom, am I right?

06:24.626 --> 06:26.459
Anyways, the real reason why I came here

06:26.461 --> 06:29.862
was to invite you guys to my
photography show on the 25th.

06:29.864 --> 06:32.231
I wish I could go, but on the 25th,

06:32.233 --> 06:34.767
I got to feed my sister birds.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.703
Did you say "feed your sister's
birds" or "feed your sister birds"?

06:37.705 --> 06:40.039
- Hey, I can't go, okay?
- Me either.

06:40.041 --> 06:42.642
Whenever I go to a gallery,
people think I'm the art.

06:42.644 --> 06:44.710
That's how I ended up in
a Russian storage facility

06:44.712 --> 06:45.812
for a year.

06:45.814 --> 06:46.946
Dana, I'm out, too, okay?

06:46.948 --> 06:48.748
Art doesn't come from privilege.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.317
The only art I like was made
by Guantanamo inmates

06:51.319 --> 06:53.319
and elephants.

06:53.321 --> 06:56.722
And I have a policy not to go
to any of my employees' events.

06:56.724 --> 06:59.659
I like to think that when you guys
leave this place, you disappear.

06:59.661 --> 07:01.060
I understand.

07:01.062 --> 07:02.895
Those all sound like
really good reasons.

07:02.897 --> 07:04.897
Hey, Vince. Quick question.

07:04.899 --> 07:07.233
If Michael agreed he was too
young to talk about sex stuff,

07:07.235 --> 07:09.135
then why did I find a new one of these

07:09.137 --> 07:10.937
- hidden underneath his bed?
- What?

07:10.939 --> 07:14.073
Marry, bang, kill... so easy.

07:14.075 --> 07:16.342
Why would Michael want
to hide that from you?

07:16.344 --> 07:18.978
Because Vince feels
that Michael is too young

07:18.980 --> 07:21.147
to be thinking about S-E-X...

07:21.149 --> 07:24.951
U-A-L-I-T-Y

07:24.953 --> 07:26.419
- A-N-D...
- Stop.

07:26.421 --> 07:27.854
Vince, you have to have

07:27.856 --> 07:30.256
an open, honest discussion with Michael.

07:30.258 --> 07:31.991
Sex is confusing.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.795
Hookup apps, rainbow parties,
rope-a-dopes, Abu Dhabis,

07:35.797 --> 07:38.097
cake pops, burger envy, turkey pardons,

07:38.099 --> 07:39.932
voting rights, Adele Dazeems,

07:39.934 --> 07:42.702
Good & Plentys, WhatsApp, first dates.

07:42.704 --> 07:44.747
Oh, okay, all right, but
if you talk about sex,

07:44.758 --> 07:46.615
isn't that just gonna
encourage him to do it?

07:46.626 --> 07:48.646
That's why my dad didn't have
the sex talk with me,

07:48.657 --> 07:49.842
and I turned out fine,

07:49.844 --> 07:53.012
- You got a girl pregnant in high school.
- Oh, so none of that was Priya's fault?

07:53.014 --> 07:54.447
Hey, sex talks are important.

07:54.449 --> 07:57.116
My pop taught me
a woman can't get pregnant

07:57.118 --> 07:59.051
if she eats a bowl of piping hot soup.

07:59.053 --> 08:00.386
And either that's true, or...

08:00.388 --> 08:01.954
I'm sterile.

08:01.956 --> 08:04.323
My mom's a doctor,
and on my 12th birthday,

08:04.325 --> 08:07.293
she gave me a model of a woman's vagina.

08:07.295 --> 08:09.128
It was really cool, actually.

08:09.130 --> 08:10.863
But we got kicked out of Six Flags.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.665
But what can I teach Michael?

08:12.667 --> 08:15.034
Everything I know about gay sex
I learned from graffiti.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.303
Yes, God forbid a straight white man

08:17.305 --> 08:20.006
has to learn about something
outside of his comfort zone.

08:20.008 --> 08:22.208
You're really confirming
my decision to kill you.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.309
Okay, fine.

08:23.311 --> 08:24.810
Where do I start?

08:24.812 --> 08:27.046
It's not my job to educate you.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.815
No, it's your job to train
four back-to-back clients

08:29.817 --> 08:32.919
this afternoon and then switch
out all the urinal cakes.

08:32.921 --> 08:34.820
I will help you, friend.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:48.336 --> 08:50.336
Next?

09:00.014 --> 09:01.311
Namaste.

09:10.725 --> 09:12.858
<i>Apollo sent a dozen Americans to...</i>

09:38.753 --> 09:41.220
72%. That's great.

09:41.222 --> 09:42.922
But when I took one at work, I failed.

09:42.924 --> 09:44.056
You can do this.

09:44.058 --> 09:45.458
You know, if you start to panic,

09:45.460 --> 09:47.550
just think about how good
Ryan Reynolds will be

09:47.561 --> 09:49.562
as you in the movie "Michael's Song."

09:49.564 --> 09:51.931
"Michael's Song"?
Shouldn't it be about me?

09:51.933 --> 09:53.899
Yes, God forbid there's an
openly gay diverse lead

09:53.901 --> 09:55.234
in a Hollywood blockbuster.

09:55.236 --> 09:58.304
Michael, you in there?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.806
I'm coming.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.086
Okay, if it itches,
scratch it if it burns...

10:14.088 --> 10:16.289
Oh, hey, let me, uh, holla at you

10:16.291 --> 10:18.090
for a little bit here, player.

10:20.762 --> 10:24.930
I was thinking it was time
to discuss your changing body

10:24.932 --> 10:29.969
and address any LGBTQIA2
questions that you might have.

10:29.971 --> 10:32.271
No, it's fine. I'm a little boy.

10:32.273 --> 10:35.207
I like childish things like
"Peter Pan" and juice boxes

10:35.209 --> 10:36.609
and Harry Potter.

10:36.611 --> 10:39.845
Okay, be that as it may, I worked
really hard on this conversation,

10:39.847 --> 10:40.880
so we're gonna have it.

10:40.882 --> 10:42.448
HPV vaccinations.

10:42.450 --> 10:45.484
Now, that ship sailed a long,
long, long time ago for me,

10:45.486 --> 10:47.153
but you got to get one, stat,

10:47.155 --> 10:48.988
- and here's why.
- Oh!

10:48.990 --> 10:51.123
Oh, my God. Wait, is that you?

10:51.125 --> 10:52.625
What? Oh, so I look like this guy,

10:52.627 --> 10:54.560
- but not Mr. Shirt in the Pool?
- Yeah.

10:54.562 --> 10:57.129
You know what? Forget it, that's okay.

10:57.131 --> 11:00.132
Moving on to something
a little bit more fun.

11:00.134 --> 11:02.468
Erections... why do we need 'em?

11:02.470 --> 11:04.303
Why can't we just lay back, do nothing,

11:04.305 --> 11:06.339
and orgasm no problemo,
like the women do?

11:06.341 --> 11:08.931
Oh, my gosh, please stop. Please stop.
Make this end.

11:08.942 --> 11:10.076
Hey, uh, uh, don't worry.

11:10.078 --> 11:12.411
Only four more short hours,
a little role-playing exercise,

11:12.413 --> 11:14.547
- and then it's all done.
- No, stop.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.350
I'm not talking to you
about any of this.

11:17.726 --> 11:20.026
I just want to figure it out
the old-fashioned way...

11:20.028 --> 11:22.295
ask a closeted art teacher.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.484
- Well, here's the test site.
- Yes.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.819
Is everything okay?

11:27.821 --> 11:29.788
I'm gonna need you're A game
for my good luck hug.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.589
Yeah, sorry. I was just wondering...

11:31.591 --> 11:33.291
do you think my poster of Matt Bomer

11:33.293 --> 11:34.693
is that inappropriate?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.428
Inappropriate? No.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.396
Shockingly sexual? Sure.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.965
Hey, hey, but there's
nothing wrong with that.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.792
When I was your age, I had already gone

11:42.803 --> 11:44.636
through four Carmen Sandiego posters.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.471
Thanks. Whatever that
is you're talking about

11:46.473 --> 11:48.458
makes me feel better.

11:48.469 --> 11:50.153
Well, I think the test
is about to start.

11:50.164 --> 11:53.073
I still feel like I didn't study enough
about women or Native Americans.

11:53.084 --> 11:54.879
Eh, they never ask about that stuff.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.482
America's a white man's game.
You're gonna ace it.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.984
And tonight you'll get
an email saying you passed.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.353
- Thanks, Michael.
- I doubt it.

12:02.355 --> 12:06.124
I take this test every year,
and I never pass.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.929
You're gonna be fine.
Paris Hilton got her GED.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.135
Oh, Vince, hey.
Is this your crying spot?

12:17.137 --> 12:19.671
Mine's usually my car,
but Asher has it this week.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.573
He went to the water park by himself.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.909
Huh? No, just sucking on
a rolled up piece of paper.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.244
Took it up after I quit smoking.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.079
Just a straight white guy

12:28.081 --> 12:31.649
struggling to give a meaningful
"bees and the bees" talk.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.084
- Are you crying?
- Yeah.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.453
Uh, but I will just bottle it up

12:35.455 --> 12:37.255
and go back to work like I always do.

12:37.257 --> 12:41.226
Hey, no, no, come on. Have a drag.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.294
Whoo! Strong.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.963
I've got the munchies.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.799
Okay, don't make it lame.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.468
So, uh, what's going on?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.504
Eh, it turns out my boyfriend, Asher,

12:52.506 --> 12:54.472
can't come to the art show either.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.408
He has a meeting to discuss
his screenplay, "Broke-lyn."

13:00.714 --> 13:03.648
Well, look, if it's
that important to you, uh,

13:03.650 --> 13:04.883
I'll go.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.317
Still beats being at home.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.486
Pretty sure I permanently
traumatized Michael.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.421
Last night he woke up
in a cold sweat shouting,

13:10.423 --> 13:11.456
"Chlamydia!"

13:11.458 --> 13:13.057
Ah, he'll be fine.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.859
I mean, my parents were a disaster.

13:14.861 --> 13:18.429
And I have a fulfilling life
of bi-weekly sex with Asher.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.933
Or is it semi-weekly? Which one is less?

13:21.935 --> 13:24.702
I don't know.

13:24.704 --> 13:27.772
Oh, fine. I'll pick it up.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.274
<i>Hey, Matthew.</i>

13:29.276 --> 13:31.576
Can I borrow your Black Eyed Peas CD?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.711
I got a feeling I'm about to...

13:33.713 --> 13:35.980
clean the oven.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.016
What the heck?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.485
Vince, you can't just walk into my room.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.887
There's always a chance I'm
wrapping your birthday present.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.923
What's with the textbooks, nerd?

13:46.726 --> 13:48.493
They're for the GED.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.794
I took it today

13:49.796 --> 13:51.629
because I never graduated high school.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.498
Mm, what?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.267
Dude, I was at your graduation.
I shouted "Baba Booey"

13:56.269 --> 13:57.769
when they handed you your diploma.

13:57.771 --> 13:59.404
And it was hilarious.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.706
But the real joke was,
instead of my diploma,

14:01.708 --> 14:03.808
- they gave me this.
- What?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.610
How's that possible?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.645
Dude, do you know what I sacrificed

14:07.647 --> 14:09.080
for you to go to that school?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.566
Sacrifice? What do you mean?

14:12.003 --> 14:13.855
Vince was looking good
for a minor-league team

14:13.866 --> 14:15.796
when I started having trouble
in public school.

14:15.807 --> 14:18.289
Our dad had just died,
so he moved back home

14:18.291 --> 14:20.992
to run the gym and pay for my education.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.194
Wait, so Vince is the good guy?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.163
But his face?

14:25.165 --> 14:27.398
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
History was just too hard.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.767
Hey, I didn't like school
either, but I didn't quit.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.903
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.705
I'm a disappointment.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.607
You're not a disappointment, all right?

14:35.618 --> 14:37.675
I wasn't smart enough
to steal the neighbor's cable,

14:37.677 --> 14:40.912
but you were, and now we never
have to read again.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.513
Plus, you took the GED.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.049
Yeah.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.951
They just sent me the test results.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.120
And it turns out I just failed.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.456
- What?
- Hey.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.924
Excuse me.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.692
I'm going to need another week or two

14:54.694 --> 14:57.896
before I make eye contact again.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.331
<i>Matthew, you okay?</i>

15:00.333 --> 15:02.233
You've been locked in there all day.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.501
Can't hide forever.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.869
Just leave me alone!

15:04.871 --> 15:07.238
I'm officially an uneducated white man.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.806
The only thing I'm qualified to do

15:08.808 --> 15:11.442
is explain things
to educated white women.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.810
Okay, well, um,

15:12.812 --> 15:14.579
I got to go to Dana's art show.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.248
The gallery turns back
into a karate dojo at 6:00,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.550
so can we talk about this later?

15:19.552 --> 15:22.687
Later, now, then...
how do I know the difference?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.088
I failed history.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.990
- Just go.
- Go to Dana's.

15:25.992 --> 15:28.259
I'll make sure Matthew
doesn't do anything stupid.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.429
Yeah, good luck.
Everything I do is stupid.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.331
Thanks.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.100
At least I know I'm leaving
one grown-up in charge.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.937
I'm hungry. Can someone slide
a slice of pizza under my door?

15:38.939 --> 15:41.739
There's a protein bar under your pillow.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.842
Cookies and cream?
I don't like this flavor!

15:57.023 --> 15:58.957
- Vince, you came.
- Yeah.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.758
What do you think?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.695
My mom says it's too smart
to show any of her friends.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.563
Yes, it's, um...

16:05.565 --> 16:06.965
provocative.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.500
- Is there food here?
- Just food for thought.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.269
At real art shows,
we want people to think

16:11.271 --> 16:12.670
about the work, not their stomachs.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.310
Had that answer spring-loaded.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.361
That's the only question
people have been asking me.

16:16.372 --> 16:17.596
- Yeah, I bet.
- Anyways...

16:17.607 --> 16:18.807
thank you so much for coming.

16:18.818 --> 16:20.511
- It means so much.
- No problem, no problem.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.680
Are these babies kissing? Is that legal?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.382
Ooh, say that louder.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.084
The scandal will attract the media.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.418
Right.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.188
- Oh, this is my favorite one.
- Ah.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.358
After I took this photo,
the baby fell of the stool.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.625
Wow, look at this guy.

16:34.627 --> 16:38.029
Just a baby with dreams of performing...

16:38.031 --> 16:39.931
like Michael...

16:39.933 --> 16:42.800
on Broadway, and...

16:42.802 --> 16:44.335
maybe writing his own musical.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.272
Yes, because aren't we
all just children?

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
I don't see that...

16:50.110 --> 16:51.743
at all.

16:51.745 --> 16:54.946
It's that children are more grown-up

16:54.948 --> 16:56.147
than we want to admit.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.249
Ah, jeez.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.632
I do not like how this
is making me so emotional.

17:00.643 --> 17:01.699
Oh, no, let it.

17:01.710 --> 17:04.188
- Great art does that.
- Yeah, great art does that, but this?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.858
I can't believe I'm feeling so much.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.460
Oh, my God, this is, like,

17:09.462 --> 17:11.762
the worst moment in my life, easily.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.968
I thought this...

17:20.673 --> 17:22.573
- Asher!
- Babe.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.409
Nick Cannon wants to make "Broke-lyn"

17:24.411 --> 17:26.243
as a limited series for the Fitbit.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.280
Dreams do come true.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.149
That's amazing!

17:31.151 --> 17:33.117
Hey, Asher, congrats. That's awesome.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.720
I one time saw Nick Cannon
at a Foot Locker.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.355
Oh, cool, man.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.290
You know, not every story
needs to be told.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.025
Like "Broke-lyn"?

17:41.027 --> 17:43.461
Look, I'm gonna peace out.
Gonna talk to Michael.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.929
I have one more chance

17:44.931 --> 17:47.398
before he puts himself up for adoption.

17:50.775 --> 17:52.409
Michael, why are we here?

17:52.420 --> 17:54.850
I'm too dumb to eat a muffin.
I'll probably eat the paper.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.519
Well, lookee here.

17:57.521 --> 17:59.623
Someone's getting
their lemon poppy-seed fix

17:59.634 --> 18:01.350
on the collection plate's dime.

18:01.361 --> 18:04.095
I just gave last rites
to a mother of five.

18:04.097 --> 18:05.930
When I bite into my muffin,

18:05.932 --> 18:09.133
for one second, I don't hear
the echoes of her death rattle.

18:09.135 --> 18:12.003
But, please, how can I help you?

18:12.005 --> 18:13.197
That was a lot.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.832
Okay, look, my uncle
deserves his diploma.

18:15.843 --> 18:18.435
- Sure, he missed a few classes.
- 40.

18:18.446 --> 18:20.083
He missed 40 classes.

18:20.094 --> 18:21.727
Because he was embarrassed.

18:21.729 --> 18:22.995
He struggled so much,

18:22.997 --> 18:24.930
it became easier for him not to try.

18:24.932 --> 18:26.198
Can't you just forgive him?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.733
Jesus didn't graduate high school,

18:27.735 --> 18:29.835
and He invented sandals.

18:29.837 --> 18:32.705
Imagine what He could've done
if He had been encouraged.

18:32.707 --> 18:34.340
I always did think

18:34.342 --> 18:36.375
you might have
a learning disability, Matthew.

18:36.377 --> 18:37.876
Thank you.

18:37.878 --> 18:41.013
I won't <i> give</i> Matthew his
diploma, but he can earn it.

18:41.015 --> 18:43.015
You can get your degree
the same way you could've

18:43.026 --> 18:46.418
back when you were in school...
by finishing your course work.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.187
I won't let you down, Sister Timothy.

18:54.645 --> 18:55.810
What is this?

18:55.821 --> 18:57.321
Cookies, dramatic lighting?

18:57.323 --> 18:59.056
It looks like "To Catch a Predator."

18:59.058 --> 19:02.159
Actually, uh, if it's okay with you,

19:02.161 --> 19:04.328
I'd like to revisit "the talk." Cool.

19:04.330 --> 19:06.330
So I'm gonna shove
all these cookies in my mouth

19:06.332 --> 19:07.665
to make myself choke.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.833
- Please don't save me.
- Look, I realize

19:09.835 --> 19:11.835
why I was being so weird
about the poster.

19:11.837 --> 19:15.506
Yes, the sex stuff is awkward,
but I couldn't admit that...

19:15.508 --> 19:18.676
if you've grown up, that means
I missed your entire childhood.

19:18.678 --> 19:22.079
Well, it was iconic.
My first word was "yaass."

19:22.081 --> 19:24.181
The nurse thought I was just crying,

19:24.183 --> 19:25.749
but I've always had haters.

19:25.751 --> 19:28.385
Well, I'm sorry
I wasn't there for that...

19:28.387 --> 19:31.002
And everything else,
except for Little League.

19:31.013 --> 19:32.222
I would've been a monster.

19:33.359 --> 19:34.692
You know, for what it's worth,

19:34.694 --> 19:36.293
I still feel like a kid most days.

19:36.295 --> 19:39.363
I've never gotten drunk.
I've never shaved.

19:39.365 --> 19:42.366
And the only guy I've ever
kissed is my souvenir Oscar.

19:42.368 --> 19:44.768
Hey, I can work with that.

19:44.770 --> 19:48.372
And, um, as far as this region goes,

19:48.374 --> 19:51.208
how about I just
prepare myself as best I can

19:51.210 --> 19:53.611
for any questions you might have,

19:53.613 --> 19:56.080
and you can ask them
if and when you're ready?

19:56.082 --> 19:57.815
And instead of "the talk,"

19:57.817 --> 20:00.751
it'll be more
of an ongoing conversation.

20:00.753 --> 20:04.288
That sounds kind of awkward,

20:04.290 --> 20:08.492
which maybe actually means
you're just parenting.

20:08.494 --> 20:10.561
Ooh! Like, better than your mom, right?

20:10.563 --> 20:12.262
Please.

20:12.264 --> 20:15.399
Okay, well, just, uh,
go check out your room.

20:19.405 --> 20:21.405
I love it.

20:21.407 --> 20:23.741
Sometimes the sexiest thing is...

20:23.743 --> 20:25.843
what you don't see.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.751
What if nobody likes me?

20:33.753 --> 20:35.252
What if everybody likes me,

20:35.254 --> 20:37.287
drawing the ire of the queen bee?

20:37.289 --> 20:39.047
- What?
- Class, this is Matthew.

20:39.058 --> 20:41.759
Why don't you go over there and
have a seat between Laura and Ava?

20:41.761 --> 20:43.193
Oh, God, they look cool.

20:43.195 --> 20:44.595
I feel so fat.

20:44.597 --> 20:47.631
If you're fat, what am I?
Come on, park it.

20:47.633 --> 20:50.450
Hey, uh, Sister Timothy,
where are all the boys?

20:50.461 --> 20:53.504
They proved a distraction to
the priests. They had to go.

20:53.506 --> 20:55.339
The boys had to go?

20:55.341 --> 20:56.940
Hey, I'm Matthew.

20:56.942 --> 20:58.442
Who's your least favorite parent?

20:58.444 --> 20:59.943
My dad's the worst.

20:59.945 --> 21:02.446
He won't get me unlimited data,
and he's in jail.

21:02.448 --> 21:05.649
Ugh, my life is so boring.
My dad is so attentive.

21:05.651 --> 21:07.618
Hey, so is there a men's room
in this building,

21:07.629 --> 21:10.409
or is it more like a "Hidden
Figures" ‐type situation for me?
