01:39.954 --> 01:41.390
Beethoven.

01:41.790 --> 01:44.858
Linus, time to get up.

01:44.958 --> 01:47.696
You don't want to be late for school.

01:47.796 --> 01:49.797
Get up!

01:49.897 --> 01:51.332
My blanket!

01:53.860 --> 01:55.427
Hello?

01:55.527 --> 01:58.812
Snow day? Snow day!

01:59.858 --> 02:01.584
No school today!

02:01.934 --> 02:03.916
Dreams do come true.

02:04.845 --> 02:06.830
No school!

02:10.500 --> 02:12.779
Franklin and Peppermint Patty
are on my team!

02:12.879 --> 02:14.005
I got my hockey stick!

02:14.105 --> 02:16.123
- I got my skates!
- Who has the pucks?

02:16.223 --> 02:19.410
- Looking sharp today, Pigpen.
- Sorry I'm late.

02:19.510 --> 02:20.903
What's taking him so long?

02:21.003 --> 02:23.005
Come on, Charlie Brown!

02:23.755 --> 02:26.483
No. Not quite. That's the one!

02:36.494 --> 02:40.189
I've got my kite!
Today's the day. I can feel it!

02:40.289 --> 02:43.018
- A kite? Today?
- In the middle of winter?

02:43.118 --> 02:46.225
- Come on, guys!
- Only Charlie Brown.

02:47.405 --> 02:51.483
A new kite, a perfect breeze.
It all feels just right.

02:51.783 --> 02:54.479
Now that the Kite-Eating Tree
is sleeping for the winter

02:54.579 --> 02:57.114
we have nothing to fear.

02:58.799 --> 03:00.167
Lift off!

03:07.483 --> 03:10.594
Wait a minute. It's in the air.
It's flying!

03:10.694 --> 03:13.681
Hey, guys! Look! Look, I did it!

03:20.896 --> 03:24.042
Hey, Charlie Brown. Still no luck, huh?

03:24.142 --> 03:28.211
Remember, it's the courage
to continue that counts!

03:28.311 --> 03:30.290
Runaway kite!

03:30.390 --> 03:32.133
Sorry!

03:35.662 --> 03:36.755
No brakes!

03:37.055 --> 03:40.023
And now, for my famous triple Axel.

03:40.123 --> 03:42.860
Prepare to be amazed.

03:43.961 --> 03:46.696
- A quadruple!
- Bravo!

03:51.385 --> 03:54.161
Stupid Kite-Eating Tree.

03:56.173 --> 03:58.241
Good grief.

03:58.341 --> 04:01.487
You blockhead! I should have known.

04:01.687 --> 04:06.426
What kind of a person tries to fly
a kite in the middle of winter?

04:06.526 --> 04:11.389
Don't you ever know when to give up?
You will never get that kite to fly.

04:11.489 --> 04:16.094
Why? Because you're Charlie Brown!

04:20.848 --> 04:23.167
- Thanks, Linus.
- Listen, Charlie Brown.

04:23.267 --> 04:27.839
Ignoring what my sister Lucy says
has enabled me to make it this far in life.

04:27.939 --> 04:31.358
What would I do
without a good friend like you?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.708
My Sweet Babboo!

04:40.101 --> 04:42.598
Isn't he the cutest thing?

04:43.688 --> 04:45.881
Careful, sir!

04:51.279 --> 04:53.514
Watch the curls!

05:20.033 --> 05:24.420
I don't care what Lucy says. I may have
had troubles in the past flying a kite,

05:24.520 --> 05:26.713
and I may have never won a baseball game

05:26.813 --> 05:29.634
but it's not for the lack of trying.

05:29.784 --> 05:34.955
My pitching has to improve if I come
out here to my trusty mound every day.

05:38.134 --> 05:41.365
Charlie Brown is not a quitter.

05:50.546 --> 05:52.556
Bottom of the 9th. Two outs.

05:52.656 --> 05:56.776
A strike-out here would make
the pitcher an instant hero.

05:57.804 --> 06:01.574
It all comes down to this one pitch.

06:11.993 --> 06:14.461
Let's see if you can handle my fastball.

06:14.561 --> 06:16.530
Ol' Number One. The Heater.

06:16.980 --> 06:19.315
The Brown Bullet.

06:44.408 --> 06:47.313
It's going to be a long winter.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.639
Someone's moving in
across the street from me?

06:57.739 --> 06:59.707
Hey, gang, look!
There's a new kid moving in!

06:59.807 --> 07:02.034
Big brother, pull yourself together!

07:02.134 --> 07:05.062
- Come on, Charlie Brown.
- Get out of the way.

07:05.162 --> 07:08.307
Hey, guys. What do you see? Who is it?

07:08.407 --> 07:11.126
I think I see a piano!
I hope he loves Beethoven!

07:11.226 --> 07:16.174
Beethoven, Schmeethoven.
Maybe he will appreciate my natural beauty.

07:16.274 --> 07:19.660
Who cares about that? As long as
he's a better goalie than Marcie.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.663
- You're hurting me, sir.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

07:22.763 --> 07:24.706
No, you're pulling on my hair!

07:24.806 --> 07:27.543
I just hope he'll have an open mind
about the Great Pumpkin.

07:27.643 --> 07:29.386
I think they have a toaster!

07:29.486 --> 07:32.715
<i>I just hope this new kid
has never heard of me.</i>

07:32.815 --> 07:36.427
<i>He would know nothing
of my past imperfections.</i>

07:37.027 --> 07:41.366
<i>It's not often you get the opportunity
to start over with a clean slate.</i>

07:41.466 --> 07:44.184
<i>This time, things will be different.</i>

07:51.576 --> 07:53.667
He did it!

08:03.037 --> 08:07.655
Snoopy... why is it that everything
I try turns out wrong?

08:07.755 --> 08:10.486
Sometimes I wonder
if the kids really like me.

08:11.086 --> 08:14.832
Maybe that new kid will see me
for who I really am, like you.

08:14.932 --> 08:18.311
A dog doesn't try
to give advice or judge you.

08:18.411 --> 08:20.796
They just love you for who you are.

08:20.896 --> 08:24.374
It's nice to have someone
that will just sit and listen to you.

08:29.396 --> 08:31.131
Man's best friend.

08:33.301 --> 08:37.691
You can't come to school, Snoopy.
Now be a good dog and go home.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.902
No dogs allowed!

08:57.024 --> 08:59.853
- I think I saw the new kid.
- Did you see that moving truck arrive?

08:59.953 --> 09:02.062
Who do you suppose it will be?

09:02.162 --> 09:04.631
The new kid is coming!

09:04.731 --> 09:08.051
- That's not the new kid.
- Hey, Charlie Brown.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.315
Good morning, Linus.
What do you have there?

09:13.415 --> 09:15.368
It's my turn for show and tell today.

09:15.468 --> 09:18.480
This is the same plane
flown by Manfred von Richthofen.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.348
- Who?
- The Red Baron.

09:20.448 --> 09:23.200
The most famous aviator
during The Great War.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.434
It's not real, is it?

09:31.191 --> 09:33.739
My naturally curly hair!

09:37.681 --> 09:39.387
Duck, Linus!

09:45.223 --> 09:48.173
Yes, Miss Othmar.

09:50.645 --> 09:52.379
Sir?

09:52.479 --> 09:54.114
Sir.

09:54.214 --> 09:55.700
Sir!

09:55.800 --> 09:58.452
Two! No, three! Was I close?

09:58.552 --> 10:01.500
Class hasn't started yet, sir.

10:02.891 --> 10:06.356
What? The new kid is joining our class.

10:11.373 --> 10:15.223
- She doesn't look like a goalie to me.
- Wow! She's pretty.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.863
She's not that pretty.

10:21.910 --> 10:23.790
Linus.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.229
She looked at me!

10:34.479 --> 10:37.425
Not the yearly standardized test again!

10:37.525 --> 10:42.312
Ma'am, will this test accurately reflect
the knowledge we have gained here?

10:42.747 --> 10:46.367
Is it fair we, at this young age...

10:46.717 --> 10:48.252
Yes, ma'am.

10:53.608 --> 10:55.176
Thanks.

10:55.276 --> 10:59.263
<i>Question 1.
"If you had 6 red tomatoes and..."</i>

11:00.098 --> 11:01.512
<i>Red.</i>

11:12.559 --> 11:14.461
<i>Come on, focus.</i>

11:14.561 --> 11:17.238
<i>First impressions are everything.</i>

11:42.949 --> 11:45.342
No dogs!

11:59.357 --> 12:02.418
Already done? She must be smart.

12:14.129 --> 12:16.725
<i>It's got teeth marks.</i>

12:17.525 --> 12:19.885
<i>She nibbles on her pencil like I do.</i>

12:19.985 --> 12:22.446
<i>We have something in common!</i>

12:22.946 --> 12:25.181
One minute left?

12:32.040 --> 12:34.258
Out of my way, Chuck!

12:35.417 --> 12:38.331
Write our names? Yes, ma'am.

12:40.481 --> 12:43.158
Chuck, are you trying to hold my hand?

12:43.258 --> 12:45.860
You sly dog.

12:47.637 --> 12:52.960
Hi, I'm Brown Charlie.
I mean, "Barnie Clown." I mean...

12:57.765 --> 13:00.318
What are you in for?

13:00.418 --> 13:04.254
Have you ever had that feeling
when you can't stop smiling?

13:05.031 --> 13:07.575
Your heart pounds inside your chest?

13:07.675 --> 13:11.236
You try to stand
but your knees become weak?

13:11.636 --> 13:15.766
And then that Little Red-Haired Girl
glances at you.

13:15.866 --> 13:20.563
And all of life's possibilities
become so clear.

13:20.663 --> 13:23.315
And then you realize...

13:23.415 --> 13:27.189
she has no idea you're alive.

13:27.289 --> 13:29.347
Why am I here?

13:29.447 --> 13:33.574
Because I just came down
with a serious case of inadequacy.

14:34.411 --> 14:38.573
<i>Here she comes. This is my chance
to make a good impression.</i>

14:42.745 --> 14:44.146
Maybe tomorrow.

15:25.213 --> 15:28.060
<i>It was a dark and stormy night.</i>

15:30.984 --> 15:33.345
<i>High above the French countryside</i>

15:33.445 --> 15:37.724
<i>the World War I Flying Ace
had never been so close...</i>

15:37.824 --> 15:42.204
<i>to his lifelong enemy...
the infamous Red Baron.</i>

17:04.996 --> 17:07.814
<i>The key is keeping a low profile.</i>

17:07.914 --> 17:10.829
<i>For now, we just keep our distance.</i>

17:15.089 --> 17:16.749
Snoopy!

17:17.049 --> 17:18.933
No!

17:22.413 --> 17:24.406
That was a close one.

17:32.339 --> 17:35.670
If I could only work up the nerve
to go over there, I'd...

17:35.770 --> 17:39.455
- What are you looking at, big brother?
- Are you crazy?

17:42.374 --> 17:45.101
You're in love!

17:54.811 --> 17:59.474
<i>Chapter 1.
It was the greatest love story ever told.</i>

18:33.167 --> 18:35.704
<i>Her name was Fifi.</i>

18:35.804 --> 18:40.289
<i>She was the most beautiful thing
he had ever seen.</i>

20:09.696 --> 20:13.167
I can't believe I'm about to talk
to the Little Red-Haired Girl.

20:13.267 --> 20:17.353
It's moments like this
when you need your faithful friend.

20:24.596 --> 20:29.141
Yep. If there's one person you want
by your side at a moment like this...

20:29.241 --> 20:31.668
it's your loyal dog.

20:47.301 --> 20:50.566
Hello? Hello?

20:53.141 --> 20:55.458
She said, "Hello"!

21:02.416 --> 21:06.989
Charlie Brown. What brings you
out here so late in the day?

21:07.663 --> 21:09.958
I need your advice on girls, Lucy.

21:10.058 --> 21:14.221
You're a girl, right? Let's just say
there's this girl I'd like to impress.

21:14.361 --> 21:16.964
But she's something and I'm nothing.

21:17.064 --> 21:20.409
If I were something and she
was nothing, I could talk to her.

21:20.509 --> 21:23.480
Or, if she was nothing and I
was nothing, I could talk to her.

21:23.580 --> 21:28.652
But she's something and I'm nothing,
so I just can't talk to her.

21:28.752 --> 21:32.714
You're being ridiculous, Charlie Brown.
Why, you have much to offer.

21:32.814 --> 21:35.966
She has a pretty face
and pretty faces make me nervous.

21:36.066 --> 21:38.810
Pretty face? Pretty face?

21:38.910 --> 21:42.599
I have a pretty face! How come
my face doesn't make you nervous?

21:42.699 --> 21:46.260
How come you can talk to me,
Charlie Brown?

21:48.929 --> 21:52.117
I just need to know the secret
to winning her heart.

21:52.849 --> 21:55.527
Look into this mirror, Charlie Brown.

21:55.627 --> 22:00.274
This is the face of failure.
A classic failure face.

22:00.374 --> 22:02.634
Do you think girls like failures,
Charlie Brown?

22:02.734 --> 22:06.231
- Well, no.
- Girls want someone with proven success.

22:06.331 --> 22:10.089
Have you won any awards?
Like a Congressional Medal of Honor?

22:10.189 --> 22:12.637
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

22:12.737 --> 22:17.157
What are your real estate holdings?
Do you have a diversified portfolio?

22:17.257 --> 22:20.478
Let me let you in on a little secret,
Charlie Brown.

22:20.578 --> 22:25.239
If you really want to impress girls,
you need to show them you're a winner.

22:25.339 --> 22:29.921
A winner? Me?
Lucy, you may be on to something.

22:30.021 --> 22:34.367
Of course, when I say "you,"
you know I don't mean you personally.

22:37.595 --> 22:40.318
That will be five cents, please.

22:44.201 --> 22:48.496
Nickels, nickels, nickels.
What a beautiful sound.

22:48.606 --> 22:52.134
"Congratulations. You're now on your way
to becoming a winner."

22:52.234 --> 22:56.639
"Step 1. Forget everything
you ever knew about yourself."

22:57.381 --> 22:59.341
Okay. "Step 2."

22:59.641 --> 23:01.643
"Project confidence."

23:01.743 --> 23:03.928
"Don't slouch."

23:06.056 --> 23:09.087
"Maintain eye contact at all times."

23:29.414 --> 23:32.052
Giddy-up, little pony!

23:33.358 --> 23:34.318
What are you doing?

23:34.418 --> 23:38.030
I'm going to be a rodeo star
in the big talent show.

23:38.130 --> 23:40.375
When I win that first-prize ribbon

23:40.475 --> 23:43.266
there will be no one who hasn't
heard the name Sally Brown

23:43.366 --> 23:46.064
and her trusty horse, Broomstick!

23:46.164 --> 23:50.001
Win the talent show.
Now that's a great idea.

23:50.101 --> 23:52.478
This is just what Lucy was talking about.

24:34.295 --> 24:36.422
We're ready.

24:52.205 --> 24:55.907
- Look at that.
- Is that Charlie Brown?

25:06.511 --> 25:07.662
She's here.

25:07.762 --> 25:11.733
I have a really good feeling that tonight
she will see the new Charlie Brown.

25:12.233 --> 25:17.254
Charlie Brown? As your psychiatrist,
I'm surprised to see you here.

25:17.354 --> 25:21.768
A person with all your insecurities
normally wouldn't enter a talent show.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.261
I'm...

25:24.861 --> 25:27.451
I ought to slug you!

25:28.241 --> 25:31.610
I've been kissed by a dog!
I have dog germs!

25:31.710 --> 25:35.548
Get hot water! Get some disinfectant!
Get some iodine!

25:35.648 --> 25:39.258
Let's keep this thing moving.
Time's a-wasting.

25:44.649 --> 25:48.560
Thank you! Break a leg, Chuck!

25:49.503 --> 25:52.775
Treat your assistant kindly, Charles.

25:52.875 --> 25:56.326
Okay, Sally, we're running behind,
so gallop, don't trot!

25:59.204 --> 26:02.401
Save the applause for the end, everyone.

26:02.734 --> 26:06.341
If you like this, wait for the encore!

26:09.157 --> 26:11.962
Your sister is really dying out there.

26:12.462 --> 26:15.787
Hey, that's not a real horse!

26:19.943 --> 26:22.745
Sorry, Charlie Brown.
This has gone on long enough.

26:22.845 --> 26:23.996
Drop the curtain!

26:24.096 --> 26:26.525
Don't do that.
She said she has a big finish.

26:26.625 --> 26:30.288
Well, it's either your act or hers.
We can't hold forever.

26:41.606 --> 26:43.916
Change of plans, Snoopy.

26:53.934 --> 26:55.226
Big brother?

26:56.186 --> 26:58.056
Rope me.

26:58.156 --> 27:00.703
That's not a real cow.

27:05.545 --> 27:07.965
I'm gonna get you!

27:19.843 --> 27:21.704
- Sorry, sir.
- Good one.

27:21.804 --> 27:24.330
Oh, Schroeder...

27:29.320 --> 27:33.441
You can run, little dogie,
but you can't hide!

27:37.045 --> 27:39.637
This is going great!

27:40.998 --> 27:43.877
My name is Calamity Sally...

27:43.977 --> 27:48.474
the best bronc-busting, lasso-roping
cowgirl in this here town!

27:54.287 --> 27:56.663
Thanks, big brother.

28:03.521 --> 28:04.781
"Moo"?

28:05.481 --> 28:08.184
Well, nobody reads
the school paper anyhow.

28:12.096 --> 28:14.059
Look on the bright side, Charlie Brown.

28:14.159 --> 28:17.060
They say there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

28:17.160 --> 28:21.505
You're right, Linus.
She definitely knows who I am now.

28:24.274 --> 28:27.094
You know, Charlie Brown,
if you like her so much

28:27.194 --> 28:30.080
why not just walk up to her
and introduce yourself?

28:30.180 --> 28:33.435
After the complete fool
I made out of myself last night?

28:33.535 --> 28:36.888
Yeah, and why don't I just
fly to the moon?

28:40.165 --> 28:42.973
<i>Oh, brother. She's talking to them?</i>

28:43.393 --> 28:46.313
<i>So much for a fresh start.</i>

28:46.413 --> 28:48.616
<i>Time is running out.</i>

28:49.216 --> 28:53.537
"Number 6." "Tell yourself, 'I am worthy.
I can do this."

28:53.637 --> 28:55.639
"'I have what it takes.'"

28:55.739 --> 28:57.582
Hello?

28:58.700 --> 29:01.503
Your girlfriend's on the phone.

29:04.941 --> 29:07.359
- Hello?
- Hey, Chuck. This is Peppermint Patty.

29:07.459 --> 29:08.812
- How have you been?
- Well, I...

29:08.912 --> 29:11.489
Listen, I have some great news
for you, Chuck.

29:11.589 --> 29:15.710
The Winter Dance is in a few weeks
and I'm saving a dance for you.

29:15.810 --> 29:19.272
Anyway, Marcie put me in charge
of the refreshment committee.

29:19.372 --> 29:22.566
I took it upon myself and signed you up
to make the cupcakes.

29:22.666 --> 29:25.361
You did what? I can't cook cupcakes.

29:25.461 --> 29:27.973
The only thing I do know
how to make is toast.

29:28.073 --> 29:30.940
Besides, why would I even want
to go to the Winter Dance?

29:31.040 --> 29:33.461
Toast and cupcakes!
That sounds good, Chuck.

29:33.561 --> 29:36.327
- See you there.
- Hold on. I said...

29:36.427 --> 29:39.216
Hello? Hello?

29:41.695 --> 29:43.449
Rats.

30:14.473 --> 30:17.147
Hey! What's going on?

30:17.963 --> 30:20.510
Turn it down! Turn it down in there!

30:25.137 --> 30:27.630
She likes to dance.

31:16.064 --> 31:19.566
One, two, three, four.

31:19.666 --> 31:22.887
One, two, three, four.

31:22.987 --> 31:25.573
One, two, three, four.

31:25.673 --> 31:29.601
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

31:29.701 --> 31:32.830
One, two, three, four.

31:36.850 --> 31:40.262
- I could really use a dance partner.
- Good luck with that.

31:40.362 --> 31:42.957
One, two, three, four.

31:43.057 --> 31:45.368
Okay, Snoopy, I got the basics down.

31:45.468 --> 31:49.029
But if I'm going to win,
I need to step it up.

31:55.510 --> 31:57.790
I can see it now.

32:04.545 --> 32:06.614
<i>We have our winners!</i>

32:06.714 --> 32:12.552
<i>Let us applaud them as they begin
the traditional dance of the champions!</i>

32:20.995 --> 32:22.856
Snoopy!

32:23.256 --> 32:27.369
Thanks for the help.
I left some cookies in your dog dish.

32:27.519 --> 32:30.914
One, two, three, four.

32:31.264 --> 32:32.856
One, two...

32:42.275 --> 32:45.602
You know, I've always wanted
to dance with Pigpen.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.453
Yuck!

32:49.099 --> 32:53.397
Why isn't anyone dancing?
It's called a dance.

32:55.529 --> 32:58.024
- Oh, Sweet Babboo!
- Oh, no, here she comes!

32:58.124 --> 33:00.041
Someone needs to get this dance started.

33:00.141 --> 33:02.028
No!

33:20.438 --> 33:25.051
These cupcakes don't look half bad,
if I do say so myself.

33:25.151 --> 33:28.220
This time I've come totally prepared.

33:28.320 --> 33:30.348
I couldn't have done it without you.

33:30.448 --> 33:34.435
The old Charlie Brown would still be
lying in bed with a stomachache.

33:39.707 --> 33:41.284
Good grief.

33:47.389 --> 33:50.696
Marcie, look! Everyone's here!

33:51.694 --> 33:54.021
Let me help you with that, Marcie.

33:54.121 --> 33:56.031
Such a gentleman, Charles.

33:58.826 --> 34:00.303
She's here.

34:04.231 --> 34:07.629
<i>Okay, ladies. It's time for you
to show off your best move.</i>

34:07.902 --> 34:11.297
<i>Which one of you will win the first half
of our dance competition</i>

34:11.397 --> 34:14.775
<i>and take home the trophy?
Let them hear it!</i>

34:15.226 --> 34:17.319
Nice moves.

34:22.824 --> 34:25.815
<i>Listen to that noise!
I think it's safe to say</i>

34:25.916 --> 34:28.426
- <i>we know who our winner is!</i>
- She won.

34:28.525 --> 34:31.697
<i>And now, it's the gentlemen's turn
to see who will be joining</i>

34:31.797 --> 34:35.029
<i>our lovely winning lady
for the final dance of the night.</i>

34:35.129 --> 34:38.143
- I got to get out there.
- <i>Are you guys ready?</i>

34:38.243 --> 34:40.716
<i>Then here we go!</i>

34:54.882 --> 34:56.884
This is it.

34:56.984 --> 34:59.511
It's now or never.

35:10.365 --> 35:14.525
Check out the moves on that
funny-looking kid with the big nose!

35:15.552 --> 35:18.238
<i>Yeah! All right!</i>

35:29.083 --> 35:33.645
<i>Okay, just like you practiced.
Remember the steps.</i>

35:34.180 --> 35:36.849
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

35:36.949 --> 35:39.776
<i>One, two, three...</i>

35:46.199 --> 35:48.978
- Charlie Brown?
- All right!

35:49.695 --> 35:52.090
<i>It looks like we may have a winner here!</i>

35:52.190 --> 35:56.659
<i>It's going to happen. I'm about to dance
with the Little Red-Haired Girl.</i>

36:04.826 --> 36:06.608
Let's get out of here!

36:09.665 --> 36:11.541
Do I know you?

36:13.570 --> 36:16.286
Wait! It's not over yet.

36:21.152 --> 36:23.120
Thanks, buddy.

36:26.198 --> 36:30.106
I hate to say it, Snoopy,
it seems like the harder I try,

36:30.206 --> 36:32.670
the further away she gets.

36:46.051 --> 36:48.771
<i>The Flying Ace took to the skies.</i>

36:48.871 --> 36:53.750
<i>He searched endlessly for the girl
who had stolen his heart.</i>

39:07.009 --> 39:10.462
Daydreaming will not make her materialize,
Charlie Brown. She's not here.

39:10.562 --> 39:13.524
- Daydreaming? Me?
- She'll be back on Monday.

39:13.624 --> 39:17.045
I heard she went back east to take care
of her grandmother, who isn't feeling well.

39:17.145 --> 39:20.855
She seems like the kind of person
who would do that sort of thing.

39:22.025 --> 39:24.194
Not another book report!

39:24.394 --> 39:26.270
Time to pick our partners.

39:26.370 --> 39:28.707
No boys. No boys.

39:28.807 --> 39:30.399
Please.

39:30.499 --> 39:33.141
- Patty! Yes!
- All right!

39:33.936 --> 39:35.670
Nope.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.791
Yes.

39:39.650 --> 39:41.135
Schroeder!

39:41.235 --> 39:46.122
There's no denying it.
It was written in the cards.

40:01.013 --> 40:03.925
<i>The Little Red-Haired Girl. My lucky day!</i>

40:04.025 --> 40:07.529
<i>This changes everything.
She will see the new me.</i>

40:07.629 --> 40:12.166
<i>And together we will win the gold star!
After that, anything is possible!</i>

40:12.266 --> 40:14.526
<i>We could be the first kids
to land on the moon!</i>

40:14.626 --> 40:19.539
<i>One small step for kids,
one giant leap for Charlie Brown.</i>

40:22.652 --> 40:24.195
You've got to help me, Linus.

40:24.295 --> 40:27.682
I'm not sure I can handle being partners
with the Little Red-Haired Girl.

40:27.782 --> 40:32.202
I need to slow things down. Maybe
I'm not ready for a serious relationship.

40:32.302 --> 40:35.473
How will I support her?
I can't afford a mortgage.

40:35.573 --> 40:40.203
- What if I'm put into escrow?
- Charlie Brown, you're being ridiculous.

40:40.303 --> 40:43.448
You're the only person I know
who can turn a simple book report

40:43.548 --> 40:45.300
into a lifelong commitment.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.402
I've never been responsible
for anything before.

40:48.502 --> 40:52.056
This could be the worst thing
that's ever happened to her!

40:55.443 --> 40:59.563
Linus, it just hit me.
I think I know how to become her hero.

40:59.663 --> 41:01.995
While she's away taking care
of her grandmother,

41:02.095 --> 41:04.785
I could complete the book report
for the two of us.

41:05.285 --> 41:09.422
That's one way to go,
but if you want my advice...

41:10.884 --> 41:14.059
They're posting the test scores. Come on.

41:14.244 --> 41:16.839
Look. Someone got a perfect score, sir.

41:16.939 --> 41:19.568
You would have to be a genius
to get a perfect score.

41:19.668 --> 41:22.845
- I didn't know that was even possible.
- Here he comes!

41:22.945 --> 41:26.376
No one in the world
has ever gotten 100 before.

41:32.347 --> 41:35.481
A perfect score? Me?

41:35.581 --> 41:38.129
- This can't be right.
- No, Charlie Brown, look.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.796
You really do have a perfect score.

41:40.896 --> 41:43.250
I have heard peanut butter is brain food.

41:43.350 --> 41:47.220
- Nice job, Chuck, old boy.
- I always knew you had it in you, Charles.

41:47.320 --> 41:50.180
This can't be right! Out of my way!

41:50.280 --> 41:54.077
Mr. Perfect, Charlie Brown?
It must be a typo!

41:54.177 --> 41:58.573
I don't believe it. I won't believe it!
I demand a recount!

41:58.673 --> 42:01.890
<i>Good afternoon, students and staff.
We have a special announcement.</i>

42:01.990 --> 42:04.261
<i>There will be an all-school assembly
Monday morning</i>

42:04.361 --> 42:07.282
<i>to celebrate our illustrious classmate,
Charlie Brown,</i>

42:07.382 --> 42:10.417
<i>who achieved a perfect score
on the standardized test.</i>

42:10.617 --> 42:13.287
Make way. Genius coming through!

42:13.387 --> 42:16.224
I have a science project due next week.
Can you give me your thoughts?

42:16.324 --> 42:17.634
Hey, I saw him first!

42:17.734 --> 42:20.903
They say you're a genius.
Can you read my mind?

42:21.003 --> 42:23.916
- Hey, leave him alone!
- Yeah, leave him alone!

42:24.016 --> 42:28.887
Now, Charlie Brown, as far as the book
report goes, what would you suggest?

42:28.987 --> 42:31.915
Well, you can never go wrong
if you stick with the classics.

42:32.115 --> 42:35.142
A comic book? I thought classics
had to have hard covers.

42:35.442 --> 42:37.865
Boy, do we feel stupid now.

42:42.058 --> 42:45.211
Will you look at this.
What a contemporary piece.

42:45.311 --> 42:47.655
Notice his use of space.

42:47.755 --> 42:50.573
Have you all lost your minds?

42:57.664 --> 43:01.143
You have what is referred to
as an "irrational fear."

43:02.436 --> 43:04.756
Hey, kid! What do you think you're doing?

43:04.856 --> 43:07.491
Following in the footsteps of greatness.

43:07.591 --> 43:11.186
- Breakaway!
- Shoot it, Charlie Brown! Shoot it!

43:15.784 --> 43:17.819
Nice use of angles there, Charles.

43:18.119 --> 43:20.969
All right, Charlie Brown!

43:21.069 --> 43:25.342
But how is Santa ever going to find
our house without lights?

43:29.297 --> 43:31.600
And this is where it all began.

43:31.700 --> 43:34.727
As a youth, he passed many hours
just sitting in that chair,

43:34.827 --> 43:36.937
keeping his deep thoughts to himself.

43:37.037 --> 43:42.066
And here we have his early kites,
used in many aerodynamic studies.

43:42.409 --> 43:45.880
If we're lucky, we'll see him
in his natural habitat.

43:45.980 --> 43:50.677
And this is his actual bed where he lies
and ponders life's greatest questions.

43:50.777 --> 43:54.539
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm cashing in on your celebrity.

44:00.202 --> 44:02.762
Can I have your autograph?

44:03.556 --> 44:05.916
And for show and tell today...

44:06.016 --> 44:07.920
my big brother!

44:23.101 --> 44:26.513
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- My whole life has changed, Linus.

44:26.613 --> 44:29.523
All of a sudden, everyone wants
to be my friend and yet,

44:29.623 --> 44:30.883
I haven't really changed.

44:30.983 --> 44:33.745
Do they like me for who I am,
or for who they think I am?

44:33.845 --> 44:36.364
There he is! Charlie Brown,
I need you on my chess team!

44:36.464 --> 44:38.849
He's got no time for meaningless games.
He's coming with me.

44:38.949 --> 44:39.906
Roll sound!

44:40.006 --> 44:42.144
- Speed.
- And, action!

44:42.244 --> 44:45.398
Do you have time to help me write
my book report? It's due on Monday.

44:45.498 --> 44:47.901
Monday? The report is due on Monday?

44:48.001 --> 44:50.928
She's back on Monday!
I haven't even started yet!

44:51.028 --> 44:55.367
- Does anyone know where Marcie is?
- She went skating with Peppermint Patty.

44:55.467 --> 44:59.995
Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown!
What about my exclusive?

45:00.095 --> 45:01.089
Cut.

45:01.489 --> 45:03.491
There's Huckleberry Finn...

45:03.791 --> 45:05.168
Catcher in the Rye.

45:05.268 --> 45:08.563
Sir, I've been sitting here for hours.

45:08.663 --> 45:12.525
These are the greatest books of all time.
Please just pick one!

45:13.064 --> 45:14.497
Let me sleep on it, Marcie.

45:14.597 --> 45:18.522
There's no time for sleeping, sir.
It's due Monday.

45:21.259 --> 45:25.814
Just my luck to get a partner that thinks
Moby Dick was a hockey player.

45:25.914 --> 45:29.024
Marcie? Where are you going?

45:30.418 --> 45:32.486
Hey, Chuck, old boy.

45:32.586 --> 45:35.998
- What brings you down here?
- I'm looking for Marcie.

45:38.867 --> 45:40.060
I need some advice.

45:40.160 --> 45:43.849
Curveball not working for you?
Slap shot not strong enough?

45:44.649 --> 45:46.959
No, I'm good with all that.

45:47.059 --> 45:51.046
I need to talk to Marcie about finding
the greatest book of all time.

45:51.146 --> 45:53.841
I just might be able
to help you there, Chuck.

45:53.941 --> 45:57.345
Marcie just read up
a long list of great novels.

45:57.445 --> 45:59.997
Huckleberry-something, Catcher with a Pie.

46:00.097 --> 46:04.227
But, she said the greatest book
of all time

46:04.327 --> 46:06.521
is called Leo's Toy Store...

46:06.621 --> 46:11.108
by some old guy called Warren... Piece.

46:11.208 --> 46:14.111
- Leo's Toy Store.
- Yup. That's the one, Chuck.

46:14.211 --> 46:17.418
- Thanks for the tip.
- Love that hustle, Chuck!

46:22.010 --> 46:25.864
Does anyone know
where I can find Leo's Toy Store?

46:47.202 --> 46:49.396
Leo's Toy Store.

46:49.596 --> 46:50.498
Nope.

46:50.598 --> 46:54.075
No. No. No.

46:55.043 --> 46:57.086
Where is it?

46:59.632 --> 47:02.017
He's going into the grown-up's section.

47:02.117 --> 47:04.194
Is that legal?

47:08.616 --> 47:11.919
Charles? I've never seen you
in here before.

47:12.019 --> 47:14.506
Marcie, thank goodness I found you.

47:14.606 --> 47:17.133
Can you help me find
a copy of Leo's Toy Store?

47:17.233 --> 47:19.777
Did you say "Leo's Toy Store"?

47:19.877 --> 47:22.414
Yeah. Peppermint Patty told me
you said it was the greatest...

47:22.514 --> 47:26.087
Stop right there, Charles. Come with me.

47:26.534 --> 47:28.986
This is what you're looking for.

47:29.486 --> 47:31.847
Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.

47:37.203 --> 47:39.855
Yikes. How long was this war?

47:39.955 --> 47:42.450
Are you sure that is the book
you want to read?

47:42.550 --> 47:46.339
Might I remind you, Charles, you only have
the weekend to complete your report.

47:46.679 --> 47:50.224
I have to if I'm going to win
that gold star.

47:53.794 --> 47:55.271
I'm okay.

48:05.532 --> 48:10.076
Big book. How are you gonna
get it home, smarty-pants?

48:19.311 --> 48:21.488
Pretty smart. What am I saying?

48:21.588 --> 48:24.150
Good ol' Charlie Brown.

48:24.250 --> 48:27.310
Now there's a guy who's going places.

48:39.265 --> 48:40.483
Thanks.

48:49.842 --> 48:51.394
Surprise!

48:51.494 --> 48:54.915
- Happy Birthday!
- Who invited him?

49:11.364 --> 49:13.641
War and Peace. Page one.

49:13.741 --> 49:18.329
"Eh bien, mon prince, so Genoa..."

49:20.623 --> 49:23.226
Hey, Charlie Brown, come out and play!

49:26.120 --> 49:27.480
Sorry, guys.

49:27.580 --> 49:30.824
- Who reads a book on the weekend?
- Okay. Where was I?

49:30.924 --> 49:34.319
"Took a horse from a commander,
and hungry and weary..."

49:34.419 --> 49:37.913
"...and the musketry fire
sounded far away..."

49:42.270 --> 49:44.915
"Prince Andrei mused
on the unimportance of greatness..."

49:45.015 --> 49:47.875
"...unimportance of life,
which no one could understand..."

49:47.975 --> 49:51.327
"...there was yesterday,
and there was the day before..."

49:54.799 --> 49:58.561
- Okay, show's over. Clear it out.
- Will there be a late show?

49:58.661 --> 50:02.073
"And to recognize a dependence
we do not feel."

50:02.173 --> 50:04.225
"The end."

50:04.825 --> 50:06.642
I did it.

50:18.248 --> 50:20.451
It's all coming together now.

50:22.543 --> 50:28.450
Okay. This is my book report
about War and Peace.

50:28.550 --> 50:32.594
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

50:32.694 --> 50:36.599
First there was war. Then there was peace.

50:36.699 --> 50:41.678
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

50:42.455 --> 50:46.150
Only 983 words to go.

50:52.615 --> 50:54.425
Rats!

50:59.289 --> 51:04.334
This is no use. I'm just not
as smart as they think I am.

51:10.942 --> 51:12.594
I can't let her down.

51:13.594 --> 51:16.940
There's still time. You can do this.

51:17.389 --> 51:19.841
You can't give up on her now.

51:27.233 --> 51:30.801
998, 999, 1000.

51:30.901 --> 51:32.795
Finished.

51:40.829 --> 51:42.948
Wake up, big brother!

51:43.048 --> 51:47.373
Today's the big assembly to celebrate
your perfect score. Come see!

51:48.980 --> 51:50.407
What are you up to now?

51:50.507 --> 51:53.885
Now that you're a big celebrity,
we have to move fast.

51:53.985 --> 51:57.597
I have shirts, hats, mugs, and more.

51:57.697 --> 52:02.209
The fame that comes with intellectual
superiority can be very fleeting.

52:02.309 --> 52:05.296
You have to cash in while you can.

52:05.396 --> 52:09.934
Today is going to be
a big day for us, big brother.

52:14.439 --> 52:17.217
Thank you. Come again soon.

52:17.467 --> 52:21.304
This is all for you, Charlie Brown.
You've really made it.

52:21.704 --> 52:23.098
It's going to happen.

52:23.198 --> 52:27.318
She's finally going to notice me
for doing something great.

52:27.718 --> 52:29.503
Charlie Brown.

52:29.603 --> 52:32.005
I hate to admit it, you blockhead...

52:32.105 --> 52:37.202
but public opinion leads me to believe,
that after all these years...

52:37.302 --> 52:39.806
I may have been wrong about you.

52:39.906 --> 52:41.416
This is not easy for me!

52:41.516 --> 52:44.619
My whole world has turned upside-down!

52:48.398 --> 52:52.387
Can I please have Charlie Brown
come to the stage?

53:00.367 --> 53:02.871
It is my pleasure to present to you today,

53:02.971 --> 53:06.974
this award for the highest achievement
in this year's standardized testing.

53:07.074 --> 53:10.703
But before I do, the school proclamation.

53:11.203 --> 53:16.242
"On this day, whereas you have upheld
the highest of academic standards.

53:16.342 --> 53:20.722
"And whereas no one would have
ever expected that of you."

53:20.822 --> 53:25.334
"And whereas you are the first
to ever receive a perfect score."

53:25.434 --> 53:29.923
"Therefore, be it resolved that today
is declared Charlie Brown Day."

53:30.023 --> 53:32.806
"Signed, Miss Othmar."

53:43.494 --> 53:45.221
That's my big brother!

53:48.849 --> 53:52.820
How about that, Charlie Brown?
You're the star of the school now!

53:52.920 --> 53:54.680
Congratulations, Charles.

53:54.780 --> 53:58.087
Let me present you with your perfect test.

54:01.812 --> 54:05.083
<i>Oh, no. I must have signed
the wrong paper.</i>

54:25.744 --> 54:30.975
Before I begin, I'd like to thank
all of you for your support.

54:33.018 --> 54:34.695
You have all been so kind.

54:34.795 --> 54:38.300
It's not often that I get
this sort of recognition.

54:38.900 --> 54:40.677
But...

54:41.877 --> 54:44.287
there's been a mistake.

54:46.891 --> 54:49.284
This is not my test.

54:51.078 --> 54:53.548
I knew it!

54:54.448 --> 54:56.338
Therefore...

54:56.999 --> 54:59.171
I cannot accept this honor.

54:59.271 --> 55:01.672
Can a brother and sister get a divorce?

55:02.072 --> 55:06.343
I think this belongs to Peppermint Patty.
She's the real genius.

55:25.679 --> 55:29.434
That was a very admirable thing
you just did, Charlie Brown.

55:30.434 --> 55:33.855
One moment I'm the hero,
the next I'm the goat.

55:33.955 --> 55:38.111
Maybe things will go your way again
after you hand in your book report.

55:38.568 --> 55:40.603
I'm not so sure.

55:40.703 --> 55:44.432
I was up all night working on it
and I can't remember a single word.

55:44.532 --> 55:47.334
Surely it's not as bad
as you think, Charlie Brown.

55:47.434 --> 55:49.853
Let me see what you wrote.

55:52.931 --> 55:57.907
Charlie Brown, the insight you bring to
such a complex novel is beyond reproach.

55:58.007 --> 56:02.150
You two are sure to win the gold star
with a book report of this quality.

56:02.250 --> 56:06.454
Book report? Were we supposed
to do a book report?

56:06.554 --> 56:09.182
Hi. In light of the fact
that you were away,

56:09.282 --> 56:13.044
Charlie Brown took it upon himself to
complete the report for the both of you.

56:13.144 --> 56:18.242
And I must say, this is one of the finest
bits of literary analysis I have ever read.

56:33.139 --> 56:35.849
No, no, no!

56:39.838 --> 56:42.682
Oh, good grief.

56:44.317 --> 56:46.919
Maybe we can fix it?

56:54.601 --> 56:58.155
<i>Chapter 4. Curse you, Red Baron!</i>

01:00:06.493 --> 01:00:11.924
<i>The Flying Ace set out across
the hostile countryside undeterred.</i>

01:00:44.164 --> 01:00:49.078
Whenever I feel really alone,
I just sit and stare into the night sky.

01:00:49.578 --> 01:00:52.623
I've always thought that one
of those stars was my star...

01:00:52.823 --> 01:00:54.766
and at moments like this,

01:00:54.866 --> 01:00:57.988
I know that my star
will always be there for me.

01:00:58.088 --> 01:01:02.050
Like a comforting voice saying,
"Don't give up, kid."

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:09.765
<i>The Flying Ace had to return
to the aerodrome</i>

01:01:09.865 --> 01:01:13.301
<i>if he was ever to rescue Fifi.</i>

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.493
Hey.

01:02:25.991 --> 01:02:30.098
<i>Christmas time is here</i>

01:02:30.555 --> 01:02:34.683
<i>Happiness and cheer</i>

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:45.203
Yeah, Chuck, your crazy dog
is over here again.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:27.017
Excuse me, mister.
Have you ever flown a kite?

01:03:28.329 --> 01:03:32.233
Well, actually, let me just say that...

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:35.070
I have years of experience
with kites, but I...

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:36.545
That's great!

01:03:37.845 --> 01:03:42.526
Well, okay. The thing is,
flying a kite isn't for everyone.

01:03:42.626 --> 01:03:46.652
It takes a certain type of person.
It can be frustrating at times.

01:03:46.752 --> 01:03:50.850
They tend to have a mind of their own.
But with determination and dedication,

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:53.053
- you can make it happen.
- Really?

01:03:53.153 --> 01:03:56.273
Here. You hold the string.
Plant your feet.

01:03:56.373 --> 01:04:00.595
Weight forward. Knees bent.
Back straight. Head up.

01:04:00.895 --> 01:04:03.797
And remember, keep it simple.

01:04:03.897 --> 01:04:07.534
- Okay.
- When I say "go," run as fast as you can.

01:04:07.634 --> 01:04:10.053
Which way, mister?

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:16.468
That way. Now, go!

01:04:19.913 --> 01:04:22.867
I hope the little guy
doesn't get discouraged, Snoopy.

01:04:22.967 --> 01:04:25.385
He doesn't quite know
how difficult this will be.

01:04:25.485 --> 01:04:28.289
It may take him years
to gain my level of experience.

01:04:28.389 --> 01:04:30.909
It doesn't just happen over...

01:04:32.059 --> 01:04:33.286
It's flying!

01:04:35.396 --> 01:04:38.966
Thanks, mister. You sure know your kites.

01:04:39.066 --> 01:04:40.630
Do you want to try?

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:51.196
You can do it! Don't give up!

01:04:53.948 --> 01:04:57.451
<i>Chapter 7. Never give up!</i>

01:04:59.045 --> 01:05:04.478
<i>The Flying Ace knew this would be the
last chance to save the love of his life.</i>

01:08:32.834 --> 01:08:36.920
<i>The Flying Ace returned to the aerodrome
with the love of his life.</i>

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.613
<i>He returned a hero.</i>

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.381
"And so, as our hero observed,"

01:08:48.482 --> 01:08:52.470
"he was destined to face
the infamous Red Baron another day."

01:08:52.569 --> 01:08:57.490
A dog that flies? This is
the dumbest thing I have ever read!

01:09:06.416 --> 01:09:09.138
I got dog germs!

01:09:14.259 --> 01:09:16.821
Come on, Charlie Brown!

01:09:16.921 --> 01:09:19.506
Today calls for something special.
Here we go.

01:09:21.808 --> 01:09:24.777
- Hey, guys.
- It's the last day of school!

01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:27.363
Well, big brother, can you believe it?

01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:32.201
No more reading, writing, arithmetic.
No more learning ever!

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:35.555
What are you talking about?
This is just the start of summer vacation.

01:09:35.654 --> 01:09:37.731
You have eight more years
of grammar school.

01:09:37.831 --> 01:09:39.300
Four more years of high school.

01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:42.037
- Eight... Plus four.
- Plus four more years of college.

01:09:42.138 --> 01:09:45.189
Add the one to an extra four...

01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:48.399
That's over 37 years of school!

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.099
I'll be bald and wrinkly by then.

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:57.534
Look at that!

01:09:57.634 --> 01:09:59.710
Is that Snoopy?

01:10:02.639 --> 01:10:04.491
Lucky.

01:10:08.562 --> 01:10:10.430
Okay, everyone, listen up.

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:13.793
I know this is the last day of school...

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:16.512
But first, before we leave,

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:20.975
we need to finish picking our partners
for this year's summer pen-pal project.

01:10:21.075 --> 01:10:25.220
When I draw a name,
stand if you want to be their partner.

01:10:25.914 --> 01:10:28.983
Here we go. The next name is... Pigpen!

01:10:29.083 --> 01:10:32.820
I will. A little dirt never hurt anyone.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.089
- Schroeder.
- I do!

01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:39.058
I mean, I will.

01:10:40.412 --> 01:10:42.545
Charlie Brown.

01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:46.326
I will.

01:10:48.502 --> 01:10:50.324
<i>She will?</i>

01:10:56.643 --> 01:10:58.896
Summer time!

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:03.650
Hi!

01:11:05.786 --> 01:11:09.815
Charlie Brown, where have you been?
It's the first day of summer.

01:11:09.915 --> 01:11:12.526
You should be down there
having fun with everyone else.

01:11:12.626 --> 01:11:15.079
I can't stop thinking about it, Linus.

01:11:15.179 --> 01:11:18.824
After all the humiliating disasters
she witnessed this year,

01:11:18.924 --> 01:11:22.494
why would she choose me?
Was she feeling sorry for me?

01:11:22.594 --> 01:11:26.241
I don't want her to choose me
just because she was feeling sorry for me.

01:11:26.341 --> 01:11:28.752
I have slightly more dignity than that.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:33.506
Charlie Brown, it might be time
to consider the wild possibility...

01:11:33.606 --> 01:11:37.185
that you're a good person
and that people like you.

01:11:37.285 --> 01:11:40.287
But, you know, you'll never
really know the answer, unless...

01:11:40.387 --> 01:11:44.579
I just go up and talk to her!
I should've listened to you all along!

01:12:06.848 --> 01:12:10.667
Oh! "Charles." I mean, "Charlie Brown."

01:12:10.767 --> 01:12:12.544
She's not here?

01:12:12.644 --> 01:12:16.800
On her way to summer camp?
So the bus hasn't left school yet?

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.976
But it's about to leave?

01:12:21.428 --> 01:12:24.465
And, by the way, it was a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

01:12:26.116 --> 01:12:28.302
Charlie Brown!

01:12:28.702 --> 01:12:30.967
You blockhead!

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.666
All right!

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.403
How do I get out of here?

01:13:31.383 --> 01:13:35.194
The whole world seems to be
conspiring against me.

01:13:36.687 --> 01:13:41.157
I'm just asking for a little help
for once in my life.

01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:52.429
Get out of here! Not you, too!

01:13:56.256 --> 01:13:58.225
Hey, look, it's Charlie Brown!

01:14:04.329 --> 01:14:06.817
Charlie Brown is flying a kite?

01:14:06.917 --> 01:14:09.837
Charlie Brown is flying a kite!

01:14:13.139 --> 01:14:15.956
- Chuck's got a kite in the air.
- Way to go, Charles!

01:14:19.207 --> 01:14:21.975
Charlie Brown is really doing it!
He's flying a kite!

01:14:44.572 --> 01:14:46.674
Oh, hi, Charlie Brown.

01:14:47.574 --> 01:14:51.029
- You remembered my name?
- Of course I did.

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:56.117
Before you leave,
there's something I really need to know.

01:14:56.217 --> 01:14:59.939
Why, out of all the kids in our class...

01:15:00.039 --> 01:15:02.274
would you want to be partners with me?

01:15:03.273 --> 01:15:05.042
That's easy.

01:15:05.142 --> 01:15:07.905
Because I've seen
the type of person you are.

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:11.700
An insecure, wishy-washy failure?

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.670
That's not who you are at all.

01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:19.606
I like the compassion you showed
for your sister at the talent show.

01:15:19.706 --> 01:15:22.109
The honesty you had at the assembly.

01:15:22.209 --> 01:15:25.947
And at the dance,
you were brave, and funny.

01:15:27.882 --> 01:15:29.543
And what you did for me...

01:15:29.643 --> 01:15:33.519
doing the book report while I was away,
was so sweet of you.

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:39.336
So when I look at you,
I don't see a failure at all.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:42.765
You have all the qualities that I admire.

01:15:44.065 --> 01:15:47.051
Sorry, I have to go now.

01:15:48.702 --> 01:15:50.555
Wait.

01:15:50.655 --> 01:15:52.927
I think this belongs to you.

01:15:53.407 --> 01:15:57.370
Thank you.
I've been looking everywhere for this!

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:03.417
I'll write to you, pen-pal.

01:16:04.985 --> 01:16:06.836
Bye!

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.867
Is he okay?

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:30.941
It must feel pretty great being
Charlie Brown right about now.

01:16:31.441 --> 01:16:33.454
You did it.

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:37.285
- Nice job, Chuck.
- Good job, Charles!

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.461
Hey, big brother!

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:44.979
I'm proud to be your little sister.

01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:48.095
Out of my way!

01:16:48.195 --> 01:16:51.658
I really need to tell you something,
you blockhead.

01:16:51.758 --> 01:16:54.177
You're still full of surprises.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.339
Good ol' Charlie Brown!

01:18:00.735 --> 01:18:02.686
Charlie Brown.

01:18:02.786 --> 01:18:07.008
Oh, Charlie Brown.
I'll hold the football and you kick it.

01:18:07.108 --> 01:18:10.352
You say you'll hold it, but what you
really mean is you'll pull it away,

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:12.905
and I'll land on my back
and I'll kill myself.

01:18:13.005 --> 01:18:15.240
But I feel I have really come to know you.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:20.138
I now understand that you are kind,
compassionate, brave, and funny.

01:18:20.388 --> 01:18:24.576
No one would pull a football away
from a person with all those qualities.

01:18:24.876 --> 01:18:29.838
She's right. I would never pull the ball
away from someone with all those qualities.

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:33.316
I'm gonna kick this ball
all the way to the moon.

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:43.365
And gullible.
I forgot to mention "gullible."

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:39.984
A round of root beers for our hero,
the Flying Ace!
