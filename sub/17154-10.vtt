00:03.542 --> 00:05.709
Hey, Nick, have you seen Kevin?

00:05.792 --> 00:08.291
I wanna trade him my tuna fish sandwich
for his tuna fish sandwich.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.959
What's the difference?
They're both tuna fish.

00:11.041 --> 00:12.875
I sat on mine.

00:14.083 --> 00:16.000
I'll tell him it's grilled.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.208
He's at a pep squad meeting
getting ready for the game on Saturday.

00:19.291 --> 00:20.667
He's really gotten into it.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.458
Kevin? He's a rocker.

00:22.542 --> 00:24.583
He would never get into
something that corny.

00:24.667 --> 00:26.375
[whistle blows]

00:27.375 --> 00:29.792
Attention, Horace Mantis Academy!

Wonder why he's gotten
so into this cheerleading thing.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.750

-That's great.

03:31.709 --> 03:33.875
Everything is gonna be perfect
for Saturday morning.

03:33.959 --> 03:37.041
I think it is so cool that you guys
are performing on <i>Great Morning USA,</i>

03:37.125 --> 03:39.250
live from right here in the firehouse.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.333
I know, and Dad said there's gonna be
a million people watching

03:41.417 --> 03:42.917
all at the same time.

03:43.834 --> 03:46.250
That has to be a huge TV.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.333
Yep.

03:49.417 --> 03:52.125
[gasps]
What is this?

03:52.208 --> 03:54.834
You guys got invited to
Jacques Le Fejette's spring preview?

03:54.917 --> 03:56.333
He's, like, my fashion designing idol.

03:56.417 --> 03:57.709
Please tell me you're going,
please tell me you're going,

03:57.792 --> 03:58.917
and tell me your taking me with you.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.333
Who wants to see a bunch of dudes

04:00.417 --> 04:02.583
who look like they haven't slept in months
stumble down a runway?

04:08.542 --> 04:09.709
No, thank you.

04:09.792 --> 04:14.625
Guys, um, this is the spring preview
for women's fashions.

04:14.709 --> 04:15.792
That means there's gonna be,

04:15.875 --> 04:17.959
like, 50 of the most beautiful women
in the world there.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.208
-I'm there.
-Yeah, who said I wasn't going?

04:20.291 --> 04:22.375
I've always been interested
in women's fashion...

04:23.583 --> 04:25.750
since about three seconds ago.

04:25.834 --> 04:28.375
-When is it?
-Tuesday, 6:00 p.m.

04:28.458 --> 04:31.000
Oh, can't go. That's the day
I mix the final tracks for the record.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.291
It's the only day
we could lock in the studio. Sorry.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.709
-It's OK.
-I can't go either.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.250
We have cheerleading practice
on the trampolines.

04:37.333 --> 04:40.542
-Oh, wait, can't you go anyway because--
-Trampolines.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.583
Well, it looks like
it's just you and me.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.166
Do you wanna grab a bite
or something before?

04:49.250 --> 04:51.542
-Cool.
-Bye.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.709
-Bye.
-Pretty exciting, Joe.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.125
Your first data with Stella.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.458
Aw, we're really happy
for you two crazy kids.

04:57.542 --> 05:00.125
It's not a date. We're all going
to the fashion show together,

05:00.208 --> 05:01.542
except you guys are not coming.

05:01.625 --> 05:06.083
Yeah, sure, not a date with Stella...
alone together.

05:06.166 --> 05:08.208
Stella only sees me as a friend, OK?

05:08.291 --> 05:11.375
Hey, Joe. OK, since we're going
to the fashion show as a couple,

05:11.458 --> 05:12.917
we probably don't wanna clash.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.500
So, don't wear anything
darker than royal blue

05:15.583 --> 05:17.917
or anything lighter than,
like, a sky blue.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
In fact, just stay the heck
away from blue.

05:21.959 --> 05:25.834
Stella, I just remembered
I can't make it that night.

05:25.917 --> 05:30.500
-Oh, why not?
-I... gotta trim my eyebrows.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.750
You know, these caterpillars
can get out of control.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.083
Yeah, I understand.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.375
Um, well, I was looking forward to it.

05:38.458 --> 05:40.208
-You were?
-Yeah.

05:42.750 --> 05:45.000
I mean, to seeing all those fashions.

05:45.917 --> 05:49.917
Wow. Um... but we're still having
lunch together tomorrow, right?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.625
Absolutely.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.375
Great.
It's a date.

05:55.583 --> 05:56.583
No, it's not.

06:04.709 --> 06:07.375
I heard you and Joe
are going on your first date.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.083
Congratulations.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.458
Joe and I are not dating.
You know that.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.834
We're just really, really good friends.

06:13.917 --> 06:16.625
I mean, besides, Joe's a big rock star.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.583
He can see any girl that he wants to.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.834
Stella, for someone who's so smart,
sometimes you don't even know

06:21.917 --> 06:23.500
what you don't know, you know.

06:24.041 --> 06:27.125
I know I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.667
-You know?
-You are all in your head.

06:30.750 --> 06:34.709
Get out of there.
When it comes to romance,

06:34.792 --> 06:37.583
-you need to follow your heart.
-Please.

06:37.667 --> 06:41.291
The only thing your heart
has ever followed is a Jonas.

06:41.375 --> 06:42.917
[exclaims]
I protest.

06:43.208 --> 06:48.083
Oh, I... I admit, I used to be
a smidge obsessed, but I have matured.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.959
Hi, Macy.
I was wondering about...

06:52.041 --> 06:54.500
Well, thinking about asking you...

06:54.583 --> 06:57.208
Would you like to go
to the basketball game with me Saturday?

06:57.291 --> 06:58.709
I mean, if you want.

07:00.583 --> 07:01.959
[sighs]

07:03.208 --> 07:05.166
I would love to, Randolph.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.667
Meet me here at 6:00, OK?

07:06.750 --> 07:09.250
Great.
Will you excuse me for a second?

07:09.333 --> 07:12.125
I've gotta go tell everyone in the world.

07:12.792 --> 07:14.500
Carl, Steve, Steve's brother...

07:15.458 --> 07:16.834
Mm...

07:17.125 --> 07:20.083
I'm impressed.
You have matured.

07:20.417 --> 07:21.792
Thank you.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.250
[exclaims]
Hey, look.

07:24.333 --> 07:27.208
There's a stain on the floor
in the shape of Nick's face.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.750
That is not an obsession.
That is a fact.

07:29.834 --> 07:32.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Step around the stain.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.250
Around.

07:37.417 --> 07:38.834
Hey, Joe.
Lunch today?

07:38.917 --> 07:41.792
I got an extra peanut butter,
mushroom, sardine, salami sandwich

07:41.875 --> 07:44.333
-with your name on it.
-[sneezes]

07:44.417 --> 07:46.834
-Oh...
-And now it's disgusting.

07:46.917 --> 07:48.583
I think I'm coming down with something.

07:48.667 --> 07:53.000
-Got a case of the love bug, Joe?
-I'm not dating Stella, OK?

07:53.083 --> 07:55.333
Didn't you see how I canceled
on her about the fashion show?

07:55.417 --> 07:57.291
Whatever.
Let's just go get some lunch.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.834
Oh, I can't.
I've got lunch with Stella, so...

08:00.500 --> 08:04.500
Kevin, me and Stella have been best buds
since, like, we were in kindergarten, OK?

08:04.583 --> 08:06.458
We have a tight friendship.
I don't wanna mess it up.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.875
I mean, would I like to go
on a real date with Stella?

08:08.959 --> 08:10.834
Of course, I would, but...

08:12.083 --> 08:13.625
Let's just pretend like I didn't say that.

08:13.709 --> 08:15.583
Too late.
You just did.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.500
I think it's time Dr. Kevin
teaches you a lesson.

08:18.625 --> 08:23.792
-OK.
-Jonas and Stella are a happy family.

08:23.875 --> 08:27.083
But what if one of these
smiley faces felt a certain way

08:27.166 --> 08:30.375
about another one of these smiley faces,
and that same smiley face

08:30.458 --> 08:33.750
didn't feel the same way
as that other smiley face?

08:33.834 --> 08:35.875
There'd be no more happy family.

08:35.959 --> 08:41.041
Only a sad family,
singing sad songs,

08:41.125 --> 08:43.834
in sad clothes, to sad fans.

08:43.917 --> 08:47.959
Sad, sad, sad, very sad indeed.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.166
This is not washable, Kevin.

08:50.250 --> 08:54.166
I know.
That's why I have this.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.667
I'm not dumb, you know.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.083
[locker closes]

09:02.917 --> 09:06.750
Hi, Randolph.
I got you a present.

09:06.834 --> 09:09.500
It's for you to wear on our date.
Stella made it for Nick of Jonas,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.083
but I think you'd look really great in it.

09:11.166 --> 09:13.166
Wow, thanks!

09:13.291 --> 09:16.041
And I also got you a cool, uh...

09:16.125 --> 09:19.458
-Hat.
-Uh, this is a wig.

09:19.542 --> 09:22.291
No, it's a hat.
Try it on.

09:24.917 --> 09:27.041
And I think I'd like
to give you a little nickname.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.959
"Randolph" just sounds so formal.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.417
Oh, well, my mom calls me "Ran."

09:30.500 --> 09:33.792
Oh, isn't that sweet?
I'm gonna call you Nick.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.417
-Nick?
-Nick like "nickname."

09:37.500 --> 09:39.375
It's a joke.
[chuckles]

09:39.750 --> 09:44.208
-Our own little private joke.
-Anything for you, Macy.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.542
Oh... See you game night, Nick.

09:46.625 --> 09:48.709
Oh, and don't take off that hat, Nick.

09:48.792 --> 09:50.500
Bye, Nick.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.166
Stella.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.500
-Oh, hey.
-Hey, I can't do lunch today.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.792
-Why not?
-I have to put reinforcements

10:05.875 --> 10:09.333
-in all my loose-leaf holes.
-Yeah, right. OK.

10:09.417 --> 10:12.208
-Well, how about tomorrow?
-I can't.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.583
-Wednesday?
-Mm-mm.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.083
-Thursday?
-Sorry.

10:16.542 --> 10:19.083
Oh, OK.

10:19.625 --> 10:22.250
You know what?
No, not OK, Joe.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.375
I mean, if I didn't know
that we were just friends,

10:24.458 --> 10:27.166
I'd assume you were
sending me some kind of a message.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.500
-What message?
-Oh, I don't know.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.792
Usually when someone
cancels on me twice in a row

10:31.875 --> 10:33.583
and then three more times in a row,

10:33.667 --> 10:37.333
I kind of assume
I'm not that person's favorite person.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.291
Stella, wait.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.041
Come with me to the big game on Saturday.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.000
-What?
-Come with me.

10:49.083 --> 10:53.542
I can get courtside seats.
My brother's a cheerleader.

10:55.917 --> 10:58.834
OK, that sounds really great.
Go, Mantises.

10:58.917 --> 11:01.417
Awesome, we're on.
It's a da-ate.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.333
It's... we're on.

11:14.166 --> 11:17.041
I can't believe you're gonna miss
our school's basketball championship.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.417
Where is your school spirit?

11:18.500 --> 11:21.542
[drumline plays]

11:21.625 --> 11:22.917
That was it.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.291
Joe, are you almost ready?
Stella's gonna be here any minute.

11:25.375 --> 11:26.959
I have to be there early
before the pep rally.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.709
[sighs]
My cold's gotten worse.

11:28.792 --> 11:30.667
I don't wanna disappoint Stella again.

11:30.750 --> 11:31.959
She was really hurt last time.

11:32.041 --> 11:33.834
Hey, Joe, I heard you had a cold,

11:33.917 --> 11:35.750
and you're going out
to some basketball game tonight?

11:35.834 --> 11:38.792
This doctor prescribes
a little, "No way, Jose."

11:38.875 --> 11:40.542
-[laughs]
-Oh, thank you.

11:41.375 --> 11:44.250
-Not you, the book.
-Come on, Dad.

11:44.333 --> 11:47.208
You're singing on
<i>Great Morning USA</i> tomorrow morning.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.750
Millions of TVs are gonna
be tuned into Jonas.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.917
Oh, now I get it.

11:53.375 --> 11:56.750
-Can't afford to push it.
-I'm fine. [sneezes]

11:56.834 --> 11:58.875
Don't make me sic Mom on you.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.083
You don't want her coming at you
with Grandma's thermometer.

12:01.166 --> 12:02.417
[sighs]

12:03.417 --> 12:07.917
Hey!
So, what do you think?

12:08.250 --> 12:11.417
Just something I threw on in,
like, six hours.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.792
Stella, I can't go.
I'm sick.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.875
No, Joe, you're wrong.
You're more than sick.

12:16.959 --> 12:19.250
-You're about to be dead.
-I'm sorry.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.500
Look, Joe, if you just don't wanna
hang out with me anymore,

12:21.583 --> 12:23.333
that's totally... that's fine.

12:23.417 --> 12:25.041
I'll still be your stylist.

12:25.125 --> 12:29.000
I just wish you wouldn't feed me
one excuse after another, you know?

12:29.709 --> 12:31.917
Just have some respect for me.

12:35.792 --> 12:37.417
I don't understand.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.542
Do you want me to draw you
some more smiley faces?

12:46.542 --> 12:48.250
Stella's more mad at me than ever.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.458
Will somebody please tell me what to do?
Kevin.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.917
-[scoffs] Forget it. Nick?
-Well--

12:53.000 --> 12:55.917
Never mind. Kevin.
Wait, Nick's right.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I should take Stella to the game.
Thanks, Nick.

12:59.083 --> 13:02.417
-All I said was, "Well."
-Yeah, but I knew what you were thinking.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.458
You and me.

13:05.750 --> 13:09.208
Joe, if you sing bad tomorrow,
it'll make the band look bad.

13:09.291 --> 13:12.500
Plus, you can't just disobey Dad like that
just because you hurt somebody's feelings.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.709
It's not someone.
It's Stella.

13:16.333 --> 13:19.959
-Why'd you give him that idea?
-All I said was, "Well."

13:20.041 --> 13:21.583
Well, yeah. All I said was...

13:22.125 --> 13:24.500
So, technically, you're more to blame.

13:25.959 --> 13:27.625
All I said was, "Well."

13:31.542 --> 13:34.375
-Stella. Stella, wait.
-What, Joe?

13:34.458 --> 13:36.000
I'm sorry.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.083
Do you still wanna go to the game with me?

13:39.041 --> 13:40.041
I thought you were sick.

13:40.125 --> 13:43.917
Sick. What gave you that idea?
[sneezes]

13:46.667 --> 13:48.417
I always sneeze
before the big games.

13:48.500 --> 13:53.333
-It's good luck.
-You're weird.

13:53.417 --> 13:57.083
-But in a cute way, right?
-Barely.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.417
Come on, let's go.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.709
Go, Mantises!

14:02.792 --> 14:05.125
-[crowd cheering]
-[fight song playing]

14:05.208 --> 14:06.166
[whistle blows]

14:09.333 --> 14:11.291
Go, Praying Mantises!

14:11.375 --> 14:12.917
[coughs]

14:13.000 --> 14:15.542
-Ooh, are you OK?
-Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:15.625 --> 14:18.125
Kick their butt...
[coughs]

14:18.208 --> 14:21.667
Mm-hmm.
He said kick their butts!

14:21.750 --> 14:25.291
-Whoo!
-[coughs] Thanks.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.333
Hi, guys.
Can me and Nick steal these seats?

14:29.417 --> 14:33.834
Hey, Macy.
Um, that's not... that's not Nick.

14:33.917 --> 14:36.625
That's Randolph dressed as Nick.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.083
I meant Nick, like, nickname Nick.

14:39.166 --> 14:42.041
Come on, Nick.
Let's go get some nachos.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.834
[coughs]

14:44.917 --> 14:48.291
Hey, um, I'm really glad we're doing this.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.917
It was kind of weird there for a while.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.375
-It was like you were trying to avoid me.
-Avoid you? How could I avoid you?

14:52.458 --> 14:54.542
I mean, we go to school together.
We work together.

14:54.625 --> 14:55.792
Yeah...
[chuckles]

14:55.875 --> 14:57.250
-[coughing]
-[cheering]

14:57.333 --> 14:59.250
-That was awesome.
-Did you see that?

14:59.333 --> 15:02.542
Yeah, I know, I just... Still,
you were making it pretty impossible

15:02.625 --> 15:04.000
-to keep a date--
-This is not one of those.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.542
-One of what?
-[whistle blows]

15:06.625 --> 15:08.542
[cheering]

15:10.667 --> 15:12.917
-You mean a date?
-We're not doing that.

15:13.875 --> 15:15.834
What is wrong with you?

15:15.917 --> 15:19.625
Nothing. I'm just trying to protect
an important friendship.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.500
-Oh!
-Huh?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.458
You know, we're not on
one of those things that people go on...

15:25.542 --> 15:28.417
Those... things.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.125
-You mean like a date.
-[grunts]

15:31.208 --> 15:32.792
-A date.
-[speaking gibberish]

15:32.875 --> 15:34.625
Joe, you are being ridiculous.

15:34.709 --> 15:36.875
I mean, it's like
you have a problem with us dat--

15:36.959 --> 15:38.458
-[groans]
-Dating!

15:38.542 --> 15:41.083
-But we're not.
-Yeah, I know.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.625
I realize that. I'm just saying

15:42.709 --> 15:44.166
it seems like you would
have a problem with it

15:44.250 --> 15:47.417
if we were, which we are not.

15:48.583 --> 15:49.875
Right.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.959
Well, if being alone with me
is so traumatic for you,

15:54.041 --> 15:57.667
don't worry about it
because it's never gonna happen again.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.792
Stella. Stella, wait. Stel...
[coughs]

16:04.166 --> 16:06.792
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

16:06.875 --> 16:10.709
Thought I'd listen to Kevin's advice,
have a little more school spirit.

16:10.792 --> 16:12.750
The only reason I don't
come to these games is because

16:12.834 --> 16:15.041
I never meet anyone like myself.

16:18.792 --> 16:19.834
Nachos?

16:21.208 --> 16:22.583
I'll see you at home.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.208
-[coughs]
-[cheering]

16:35.000 --> 16:36.917
Joe, you gotta hurry up and get changed.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.875
The <i>Great Morning USA</i> crew's
gonna be here early.

16:38.959 --> 16:41.041
-[raspy] Stella hates me.
-What has happened to your voice?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.291
You can't sing with that voice.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.500
This band is about to perform on live TV

16:44.583 --> 16:47.625
and that TV show is not called
<i>Only OK Morning USA.</i>

16:47.709 --> 16:49.500
And it's not called
<i>Pretty Good Morning USA.</i>

16:49.583 --> 16:51.000
It's called <i>Great Morning USA,</i>

16:51.083 --> 16:53.625
which means we have to be
great to even be on it.

16:53.709 --> 16:55.000
Dad was right.
You shoulda never gone out last night.

16:55.083 --> 16:59.000
-He's gonna kill you.
-He'll have to get in line behind Stella.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.083
-[Dad] Children!
-[Kevin yells]

17:01.208 --> 17:03.291
It's Dad. He can't find out
that Joe lost his voice.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.291
-He'll freak out!
-Quick, into the bathroom.

17:05.375 --> 17:06.625
Uh, no, I'm good.
I already went.

17:06.709 --> 17:08.542
No, take Joe in there and hide.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.709
<i>The Great Morning USA</i> crew's on their way.
Is everybody ready?

17:11.041 --> 17:12.250
Joe, you ready?

17:12.333 --> 17:13.959
Uh, we were just deciding
what he's gonna wear.

17:14.041 --> 17:17.500
-Are you wearing pajamas, Joe?
-Of course he's not gonna wear pajamas.

17:17.583 --> 17:20.625
Well... he's still wearing pajamas.
Those are your pajamas, aren't they, Joe?

17:20.709 --> 17:23.875
You know, he decided
he's gonna wear his gray suit.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.583
Grey suit. Grey suit. Gray suit is good.
Million people watching.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.458
All right, guys, look,
<i>Great Morning USA</i>

17:28.542 --> 17:30.375
is the biggest morning show
in the country, all right,

17:30.458 --> 17:31.291
so we gotta be sharp.

17:31.375 --> 17:32.959
That's why I'm riding you
so hard about your look.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.000
-Uh, Dad.
-Yeah.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.208
What, do you think I forgot
to put my pants on?

17:42.291 --> 17:45.333
[chuckles] Let me tell you something...
Oh, I'm freaking out!

17:46.041 --> 17:48.750
Joe, you have to keep your voice down
to the last possible second.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.542
Absolutely no talking whatsoever.

17:50.625 --> 17:52.875
Joe, we have to talk.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.709
I mean, what is going on between us?

17:56.792 --> 17:58.792
You're my best and closest guy friend.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.291
-And lately you have just been acting--
-Really weird.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.417
Whoa, what happened to your voice?

18:03.500 --> 18:06.000
I'll help translate. He said,
[raspy] "Really weird."

18:06.083 --> 18:07.959
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

18:08.875 --> 18:10.917
Right, well, you have been
acting really weird.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.875
And why, just because the two of us
have been going out together?

18:13.959 --> 18:16.917
-We're not going out.
-He said, [raspy] "We're not going out."

18:17.000 --> 18:18.500
[groans]
I know. I realize that. I'm sorry.

18:18.583 --> 18:22.417
I didn't mean "going out" going out.
I meant going out.

18:22.500 --> 18:26.208
Joe and Stella. Stella and Joe.
Best friends since forever.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.500
She said, [high-pitched]
"We're not, 'going out' going out.

18:28.583 --> 18:30.959
We've just been, like,
best friends since, like, forever."

18:32.041 --> 18:34.625
Sorry. I kind of got caught up
in the whole translating thing.

18:34.709 --> 18:36.166
I'm pretty good at it, huh?

18:36.250 --> 18:39.792
Joe, you and I have been best buds
since we were little kids.

18:39.875 --> 18:43.333
I mean, we have such a tight friendship,
and I don't wanna risk messing that up.

18:43.417 --> 18:46.333
Would I like to go on
a real date with you? Of course!

18:51.083 --> 18:54.875
Um...
Let's pretend I didn't just say that.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.959
Kevin, I'm suddenly very hungry.

18:57.041 --> 18:59.250
I'm gonna go upstairs to the snack bar
and get something to eat, Kevin.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.625
Would you like to join me, Kevin?

19:00.709 --> 19:02.542
You two crazy kids gonna be OK without me?

19:02.625 --> 19:04.083
-Just go!
-[Joe] Go!

19:05.125 --> 19:06.667
[Kevin] He said...
[raspy] "Go!"

19:08.041 --> 19:11.083
Um, let's... let's suppose...

19:11.834 --> 19:16.041
Let's suppose that I possibly feel
a certain way about you.

19:17.667 --> 19:21.417
Is it possible you possibly feel
the same way about me?

19:23.625 --> 19:27.291
Oh, OK, now let's say
we possibly started dating.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.542
That would be a bad, bad idea, right?

19:32.625 --> 19:34.625
I mean, maybe it would be
the best thing that ever happened to us,

19:34.709 --> 19:36.125
but what if it wasn't?

19:36.208 --> 19:40.333
I mean, would it be worth risking
all that if it ended badly?

19:40.542 --> 19:43.208
No, no, no, it wouldn't.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.166
I mean, maybe we have feelings
and maybe we don't,

19:45.250 --> 19:51.041
but this band and our friendship
is too valuable to risk losing.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.333
We can't go down this road, huh?

19:58.583 --> 20:00.583
Thanks for talking this
through with me, Joe.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.250
[knocking on door]

20:16.792 --> 20:18.083
It's the <i>Great Morning USA</i> crew!

20:18.166 --> 20:20.291
They're early!
Hide him, hide him.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.792
Hi, welcome.
This way.

20:25.917 --> 20:27.792
OK, yeah, right on up those stairs.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.166
-What about my voice?
-We're doomed.

20:31.250 --> 20:32.875
He sounds terrible.

20:32.959 --> 20:36.917
I don't know.
I think he sounds... kind of hot.

20:41.709 --> 20:44.750
-Hey, Kevin.
-Already ahead of you, bro.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.208
I'll make it.

21:47.750 --> 21:51.000

22:18.875 --> 22:20.083
Hey!

22:22.166 --> 22:25.083
Why does romance have to be so hard?

22:25.166 --> 22:27.083
Aww!

22:27.166 --> 22:29.875
Well, excuse me.
I have no idea what you're talking about.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.417
My love life is rockin'

22:31.500 --> 22:33.625
-with a touch of rollin'.
-Well, good.

22:33.709 --> 22:35.792
-Macy.
-Oh, hi, Nick.

22:36.250 --> 22:39.125
I'm sorry. It's just not gonna
work out between us.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.542
Here's your Nick outfit, your Nick hat,

22:43.625 --> 22:46.792
and your Nick instruction manual
you left for me.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.792
If you see me in class,
just call me Randolph

22:51.875 --> 22:55.458
or Randy or Edgar,
really anything but Nick.

22:58.250 --> 23:01.917
Aw, Mace.
I'm sorry.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.750
[sighs]
It's for the best.

23:04.834 --> 23:08.417
I just can't see being with someone
who isn't comfortable being them self.
