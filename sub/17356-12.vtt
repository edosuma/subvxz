WEBVTT

00:06.707 --> 00:10.476
- Let's see--Trigonometry,
World History, Biology.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.411
- You've got a lot of
homework tonight.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.580
- Phoebe, this is
homework I'm not doing.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.382
[laughs]
- [locker door slams]

00:16.384 --> 00:19.251
- GIDEON:
Max, Phoebe, save me!

00:19.253 --> 00:21.220
- Save you?
Why would you ask us?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.488
We don't have
any powers anymore.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.289
Why? What have
you heard?

00:24.759 --> 00:27.626
- Can I at least use
your bodies as shields?

00:27.628 --> 00:28.260
- From what?

00:28.262 --> 00:30.462
- BRADFORD: Gideon!
- Principal Bradford.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.597
He's mad because
I complained

00:31.599 --> 00:33.465
to the School Board
about his new shorts.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
- What's wrong
with his shorts?

00:37.805 --> 00:40.739
Oh! He should
always wear pants.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.674
- Ewww...

00:43.711 --> 00:44.476
- Where are you, Gideon?

00:44.478 --> 00:48.547
I've got a dodgeball
with your name on it.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.250
- Bradford being temporary
gym teacher's a bad idea.

00:51.252 --> 00:54.620
Of course, Bradford being
principal's also a bad idea.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.056
- ¶ Oh, Gideon... ¶

00:57.058 --> 01:00.692
¶ Come out to play-ay ¶

01:01.495 --> 01:03.595
- Gideon, I know standing
up for yourself is hard,

01:03.597 --> 01:05.230
'cause you're such
a 'fraidy cat.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.399
- Forget it.
I'll hide in here.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.367
- [locker door slams]

01:08.369 --> 01:10.469
- Gideon, are you
in your locker?

01:10.471 --> 01:11.503
- GIDEON:
Don't worry,

01:11.505 --> 01:13.539
I've got water rations
in here to last a week.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.741
- You may have won
this round, Gideon.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.411
But you still have to
face me tomorrow in gym.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.546
- Hey!

01:20.548 --> 01:23.115
When's your
leg day workout, 'bro?

01:23.117 --> 01:23.715
- [chuckling]

01:23.717 --> 01:26.385
Your question
is your first mistake.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.787
Every day is leg day.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.257
- Is he gone?
- No, not yet.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.259
- [locker door slams]
- GIDEON: Ow!

01:34.261 --> 01:36.662
- Phoebe,
what are you doing?

01:36.664 --> 01:37.796
- I have a plan.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.630
- I'm way ahead of ya.

01:38.632 --> 01:42.267
Gonna cut back on cardio,
start focusing on the glutes.

01:42.269 --> 01:46.538
- Max, a superhero's job isn't
just to save people, right?

01:46.540 --> 01:48.340
It's to help people
save themselves.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.842
So, that's what we're
gonna do for Gideon.

01:49.844 --> 01:53.145
- Okay, okay. I'm just
figuring out excuses

01:53.147 --> 01:54.146
to get outta this.

01:54.148 --> 01:54.847
- PHOEBE:
[sighs]

01:54.849 --> 01:57.149
Relax. You're not even
gonna have to do anything.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.351
This baby is gonna
do all the work for us.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.688
- And how is Hiddenville's
ugliest bracelet gonna help?

02:02.690 --> 02:05.157
- Max, you gave me
this bracelet.

02:05.159 --> 02:05.824
- As a joke.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.826
- Yeah, well,
Gideon doesn't know

02:07.828 --> 02:10.262
that this is just
an ordinary bracelet.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.196
Watch.

02:11.198 --> 02:13.599
Hey, Gideon,
come on out.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.869
Here, take my hand.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.872
- GIDEON:
Oh!

02:19.874 --> 02:23.308
- Gideon, I have
something to give you.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.576
This is a special bracelet

02:24.578 --> 02:27.846
that always used to give me
a little bit of extra strength

02:27.848 --> 02:28.847
when I was a superhero.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.183
I think it'll do
the same for you.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.685
- Wow, I kind of
feel stronger.

02:33.687 --> 02:37.389
Do I look stronger?
- PHOEBE: Hm?

02:37.391 --> 02:38.490
- How come you're
not answering?

02:38.492 --> 02:41.260
Has my strength rendered
you speechless?

02:41.262 --> 02:42.895
- The point is now
you'll be able to face

02:42.897 --> 02:45.330
Bradford's dodgeballs
without fear tomorrow.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.867
- Thanks, Boo.
- No problem, just-a-friend.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.471
- Do you really think
that bracelet's gonna work?

02:52.473 --> 02:53.472
- Hey, it was either that

02:53.474 --> 02:55.474
or give him the ugly
shirt you're wearing.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.242
- You gave me this shirt.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.244
- Yeah. As a joke.

03:01.749 --> 03:06.185
- ¶

03:06.187 --> 03:08.754
- All right, guys,
I want a clean match,

03:08.756 --> 03:10.489
or time out for everybody.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.757
- [whistle shrills]

03:11.759 --> 03:14.359
- NORA & BILLY: Rock,
paper, laser, shoot!

03:14.361 --> 03:15.360
- [laser zapping]
- Ow!

03:15.362 --> 03:18.230
I've got a good feeling
about this next round.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.632
- NORA & BILLY: Rock,
paper, laser, shoot!

03:20.634 --> 03:21.567
- [laser zapping]
- Ow!

03:21.569 --> 03:24.503
I've got a good feeling
about this next round.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.938
- NORA & BILLY: Rock,
paper, laser, shoo--

03:25.940 --> 03:29.575
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:29.577 --> 03:30.242
Absolutely not.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.743
- Yeah, you guys have
broken enough stuff

03:31.745 --> 03:33.512
around this house
with that game.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.413
- That's not true.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.382
We've broken stuff
outside the house, too.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.952
- No more rock,
paper, laser.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.520
Sorry, guys,
but them's the rules.

03:41.522 --> 03:45.257
- Mmm, that's also the name
of the movie we're about to see.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.227
"Them's the Rules"
starring Vin Diesel

03:48.229 --> 03:50.562
as Jebediah Rules.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.897
- "A frontier dentist

03:51.899 --> 03:55.534
who always bites off
more than he can chew."

03:56.604 --> 03:58.737
- They lost me after...

03:58.739 --> 04:00.439
all of those words.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.840
- We're gonna be late.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.276
Uh, kids, we ordered
you a pizza.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.245
- Thunder couple, away!

04:06.247 --> 04:07.279
- [loud thud]

04:07.281 --> 04:09.615
- [plaster splattering]

04:10.784 --> 04:11.950
- There they go...

04:11.952 --> 04:14.286
they're doing a loop...

04:14.288 --> 04:15.053
lost them in a cloud...

04:15.055 --> 04:17.990
and we are officially
free to keep playing.

04:17.992 --> 04:18.724
- Game on!

04:18.726 --> 04:21.426
- Okay. But I've got a good
feeling about this next round.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.662
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

04:23.664 --> 04:25.564
Pizza Delivery approaching.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.466
- NORA & BILLY: Rock,
paper, laser, shoot!

04:27.468 --> 04:30.535
- [laser zapping]
- [monitor sizzling]

04:32.673 --> 04:34.539
- Rock, paper, later...

04:34.541 --> 04:35.707
[whooshing]

04:35.709 --> 04:37.409
- BOTH:
This is bad.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.311
- Jinx. You owe me
a new thunder monitor.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.979
Seriously, if you
have an extra one,

04:40.981 --> 04:43.582
this is the time
to speak up.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.885
- [electrical zapping]

04:49.056 --> 04:52.858
- All right, gym rats, I know
what you're all thinking.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.459
- That your shorts
got shorter!

04:54.461 --> 04:56.561
- STUDENTS:
[laughing]

04:57.631 --> 04:58.864
- No, you're thinking,

04:58.866 --> 05:00.866
what's he got
behind the sheet?

05:00.868 --> 05:02.834
- The rest of your shorts?

05:02.836 --> 05:05.437
- No!

05:05.439 --> 05:08.907
I give you
the Dodgenovski 3000!

05:08.909 --> 05:10.909
[chuckling]

05:11.312 --> 05:15.347
They use this to train
Russian dodgeball players.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.683
I use it to hurt people.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.485
- That looks really
expensive.

05:20.487 --> 05:20.986
- It was.

05:20.988 --> 05:25.057
PS, class trip to DC
has been cancelled.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.061
- You think his mother
never hugged him or...?

05:29.363 --> 05:32.064
- Now, who should
I try it on?

05:32.066 --> 05:33.632
Let's see,
which one of you

05:33.634 --> 05:35.934
called the School
Board on me?

05:38.772 --> 05:40.972
About my shorts?

05:41.608 --> 05:43.508
Gideon, get over here!

05:43.510 --> 05:46.545
- Phoebe, take as long as
you need to mourn me.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.347
But I want you
to move on.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.349
- Remember, Gideon,
that bracelet will give you

05:50.351 --> 05:53.051
all the strength you
need to get through this.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.519
- The bracelet
gives me strength,

05:54.521 --> 05:55.787
the bracelet gives
me strength,

05:55.789 --> 05:56.888
the bracelet
gives me strength.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.558
- Watch, Max, he's goin' out
there, not backing down.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.927
It's the first step in Gideon
standing up for himself.

06:01.929 --> 06:05.731
- What's step two? Picking
up his spleen medicine?

06:06.533 --> 06:09.067
- Gideon, this is
for my legs.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.936
They deserve to be seen.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.771
- [contraption fires]
- [dodgeball bounces]

06:12.773 --> 06:17.809
- Aw, shoot, I forgot to
turn on the laser sight.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.412
- The red dot's on me,
isn't it?

06:20.414 --> 06:21.780
- Not with the bracelet.
Believe!

06:21.782 --> 06:23.648
- [contraption fires]
- [dodgeball bounces]

06:23.650 --> 06:25.417
- [contraption fires]
- [dodgeball bounces]

06:25.419 --> 06:27.519
- See? It's working.
- No, I'm working.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.688
- [contraption fires]
- [dodgeball bounces]

06:29.690 --> 06:31.857
- [contraption fires]
- [dodgeball bounces]

06:31.859 --> 06:33.825
- [contraption fires]
- [dodgeball bounces]

06:33.827 --> 06:35.060
- Max, you're taking
this too far.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.962
You should stop before
something bad happens.

06:36.964 --> 06:37.829
- [contraption whines]

06:37.831 --> 06:40.532
[contraption fires]
- [dodgeball bounces]

06:40.834 --> 06:44.603
- This bracelet
gave me superpowers!

06:45.706 --> 06:48.940
- Oh, you mean like that.
- Yeah, like that.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.477
- ¶

06:52.479 --> 06:53.578
¶ What you see ¶

06:53.580 --> 06:54.780
¶ Is not what you get ¶

06:54.782 --> 06:58.450
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

06:58.452 --> 06:59.918
¶ We fit right in ¶

06:59.920 --> 07:01.153
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

07:01.155 --> 07:02.888
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

07:02.890 --> 07:04.589
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

07:04.591 --> 07:06.458
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

07:06.460 --> 07:08.427
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

07:08.429 --> 07:09.828
¶ Look closer,

07:09.830 --> 07:11.463
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

07:11.465 --> 07:13.131
¶ This isn't

07:13.133 --> 07:14.766
¶ It's our reality ¶

07:14.768 --> 07:15.867
¶ Just your average family ¶

07:15.869 --> 07:19.504
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

07:19.506 --> 07:23.775
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

07:27.581 --> 07:28.413
- Max, it's all your fault.

07:28.415 --> 07:32.751
- Hey! Don't blame me
for something I did.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.053
- I just wanted to help Gideon's
confidence by lying to him,

07:35.055 --> 07:36.755
not make him think
he has superpowers.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.290
- And I didn't wanna
do any of this.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.192
But you were all,
blah, blah, blah,

07:40.194 --> 07:42.894
help people help themselves.
- PHOEBE: [sighs]

07:42.896 --> 07:44.095
Okay, Max, just please
do me a favor

07:44.097 --> 07:46.898
and don't use your
telekinesis on him anymore.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.766
- He's a smart guy.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.800
I'm sure by now,
he realizes

07:48.802 --> 07:51.169
he doesn't actually
have superpowers.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.638
- GIDEON: Behold,
my superpowers!

07:53.640 --> 07:56.942
- What I meant was he's not
going to do anything stupid.

07:56.944 --> 08:00.745
- With my power bracelet,
I can flip off this ledge

08:00.747 --> 08:03.782
without breaking
a single super-bone.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.050
- What I meant was--

08:05.052 --> 08:07.686
- Stop predicting things.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.921
- PHOEBE:
[powers whooshing]

08:09.923 --> 08:12.858
- STUDENTS:
[gasping]

08:13.327 --> 08:15.794
- What was I supposed to do?
He was gonna hurt himself.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.796
- Well, yeah, but it
was gonna be funny.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.064
- We've gotta get
that bracelet back,

08:19.066 --> 08:21.333
or Gideon's gonna keep
thinking he has superpowers,

08:21.335 --> 08:22.234
and put himself in danger.

08:22.236 --> 08:25.237
Hey, Gideon, um, look,
about that bracelet--

08:25.239 --> 08:26.338
- It's incredible!

08:26.340 --> 08:27.639
Ever since I put it on,

08:27.641 --> 08:29.875
I've been able to do
all these amazing things.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.310
- I'm so glad
you like it.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.845
Now give it back.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.247
- Are you kidding me?

08:35.249 --> 08:37.215
This thing's
never coming off.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.184
I glued it to my wrist.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.753
- He does the same
thing to his underwear

08:41.755 --> 08:44.322
to keep from
gettin' wedgies.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.324
- No way I'm losing
my superpowers now.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.693
- Okay, but Gideon, powers
can be dangerous, okay?

08:48.695 --> 08:51.363
You should leave that stuff
to the real superheroes.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.732
- I guess you're right.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.869
Which is why I will become
a real superhero.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.739
- Yeah, that's
a good joke.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.275
Oh, please be a joke.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.711
- From now on,
call me "The Giddler,"

09:06.713 --> 09:09.714
watching over the city
from the rooftops.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.417
- You're gonna be
"The Giddler on the Roof"?

09:12.419 --> 09:13.952
- MAX:
[laughs]

09:13.954 --> 09:16.288
- But, Gideon, you could
get seriously hurt.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.822
- I feel no pain.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.325
Giddler, away!

09:21.929 --> 09:24.195
- Well, the good news
is his confidence level

09:24.197 --> 09:25.730
is at an all-time high.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.464
- Yeah? The bad news?

09:26.466 --> 09:29.401
- He's probably gonna
fall off the roof.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.339
- The thunder monitor's
been broken for a day

09:34.341 --> 09:36.274
and you're just
calling me now?

09:36.276 --> 09:40.278
- Well, I fixed it,
but Nora has concerns.

09:41.114 --> 09:45.717
President Kickbutt, did you
do something new with your hair?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.018
- We have to fix this

09:47.020 --> 09:49.087
before Mom and Dad
come home and see it.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.822
Do you think
you can help us?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.157
- Don't ask me,
ask my jingle.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.160
¶ When you're in a hurry,
don't you worry ¶

09:55.162 --> 09:57.963
¶ Call the Furry Fix-It ¶

09:57.965 --> 09:58.763
- Are you done?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.199
- ¶ If it's broken,
I'm not jokin' ¶

10:01.201 --> 10:04.169
¶ I will come and fix it ¶

10:04.171 --> 10:06.338
¶ F-i-x-i-t ¶

10:06.340 --> 10:12.110
¶ I will fix it ¶¶
[sustained]

10:12.913 --> 10:14.746
- So, can you fix it?

10:14.748 --> 10:15.914
- [sighing]

10:15.916 --> 10:18.183
Let's just talk
about my price.

10:18.185 --> 10:18.950
- What do you want?

10:18.952 --> 10:22.887
- All I can eat
Italian gelato.

10:22.889 --> 10:23.955
- Deal.

10:23.957 --> 10:24.823
- Kids, we're home.

10:24.825 --> 10:28.460
- Oh, no, we can't let Mom
and Dad come in the living room.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.061
- [back door closes]

10:30.063 --> 10:30.929
- Hey, Mom and Dad!

10:30.931 --> 10:33.932
Uh, I thought you guys
just went to go see a movie.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.866
- "Them's the Rules"

10:34.868 --> 10:36.234
was sold out for
the second day in a row.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.270
There must be somewhere in
the world where we can see it.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.773
- Well, let's ask
the thunder monitor.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.342
Thunder monitor--
- No, don't go in there!

10:44.344 --> 10:45.210
- What? Why not?

10:45.212 --> 10:49.447
- Because...you guys don't
need to go see a movie,

10:49.449 --> 10:53.351
when Billy and I can act
it out right here for you,

10:53.353 --> 10:54.986
not in the living room.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.222
- Yeah, we've read
all of the books.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.358
Our story begins with
a man named Jebediah.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.193
- Kids, I don't think--
- Shhhh!

11:02.195 --> 11:03.828
It's starting.
It's starting.

11:03.830 --> 11:08.199
- Jebediah, you may have filled
the cavity in my tooth,

11:08.201 --> 11:12.804
but you will never fill
the cavity in this town's heart.

11:13.306 --> 11:17.242
- Why would a dentist put
braces on a talking horse?

11:17.244 --> 11:19.844
- Because the aliens
told him to, Barb.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.979
Pay attention.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.313
- COLOSSO:
And done!

11:22.315 --> 11:23.415
- Was that Colosso?
- Yep.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.283
Anyway, they all lived
happily ever after.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.252
The end.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

11:27.254 --> 11:28.286
That can't be the end.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.121
Did the talking horse
find its floss?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.123
Did Abraham Lincoln
find his toothbrush?

11:32.125 --> 11:34.159
- Guess you'll have
to read the books.

11:34.161 --> 11:38.096
- Oh, great idea.
Barb, to the library!

11:39.833 --> 11:42.133
- [door closes]
- Let's go check on Colosso.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.269
- Colosso, you fixed it.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.539
- That's right.
Now, everybody...

11:47.541 --> 11:49.374
- ALL:
¶ F-i-x-i-t ¶

11:49.376 --> 11:50.341
¶ I will fix... ¶

11:50.343 --> 11:55.113
¶ It ¶¶
[sustained]

11:56.049 --> 11:59.084
- [electrical zapping]

12:03.890 --> 12:05.056
- Oh, that was exhausting.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.026
We spent all day trying to
keep the Giddler on the Roof

12:08.028 --> 12:10.495
from becoming
the Pancake on the Sidewalk.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.565
- My hand is so sore
from using telekinesis.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.900
Ow! Tele-cramp!

12:15.902 --> 12:16.901
[blowing frosty air]

12:16.903 --> 12:18.903
- Okay, at least we have
time to catch our breath

12:18.905 --> 12:21.039
since Gideon never misses
his Hip Hop dance class.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.575
- Gideon takes
Hip Hop dance class?

12:23.577 --> 12:25.610
- He teaches it.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.579
Okay, we've gotta
come up with a plan

12:27.581 --> 12:29.581
to get that bracelet back
without Gideon knowing.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.116
- [scoffs]
If I were still evil,

12:31.118 --> 12:33.585
I'd just rip it right
off his dainty wrist.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.153
- Wait a sec.

12:35.155 --> 12:35.920
Max, that's it!

12:35.922 --> 12:38.189
- You want me to go
back to being evil?

12:38.191 --> 12:40.625
Colosso's gonna
be so happy.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.228
- We should just disguise
ourselves as supervillains,

12:43.230 --> 12:45.964
and steal the bracelet
off his wrist.

12:45.966 --> 12:46.464
- I'm in.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.600
If I get to pick
out the villain outfits.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.436
- Sure. Just don't
make me look ridiculous.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.071
[squeaks]
Ow! Tele-cramp!

12:53.073 --> 12:56.107
- Too late. You
look totally ridi--

12:56.109 --> 12:59.611
- [blowing frosty air]
- Ow! Tele-cramp!

12:59.613 --> 13:02.180
- BOTH:
[blowing frosty air]

13:03.350 --> 13:06.217
- Colosso, that's
your 7th bowl of gelato.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.987
- Oh, are we stating
the obvious?

13:08.989 --> 13:09.954
Here's one--

13:09.956 --> 13:12.423
lasers always
win, dummy.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.627
- Is that true, Nora?

13:15.629 --> 13:16.227
- Uh...

13:16.229 --> 13:19.497
I'm so glad the thunder
monitor's fixed.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.298
- [monitor beeping]

13:20.300 --> 13:22.500
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Activating "Party Mode."

13:22.502 --> 13:25.470
- [loud dance music
playing]

13:25.472 --> 13:28.506
¶

13:28.508 --> 13:30.108
- That's weird.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.442
Thunder monitor,
turn off.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.611
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

13:33.613 --> 13:34.679
- [noisemaker tooting]

13:34.681 --> 13:36.347
- Colosso,
it's still broken.

13:36.349 --> 13:40.351
- Uh...who's up
for a dance party?

13:40.353 --> 13:41.653
- You know I am.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.620
Party over here!

13:42.622 --> 13:47.258
- [loud dance music
continues playing]

13:47.260 --> 13:49.160
- [record scratches]

13:49.162 --> 13:51.663
- Colosso, you said
you fixed it.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.265
- There's a perfectly
good explanation for that.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.968
¶ Here's my motto,
I just wanted gelato ¶

13:56.970 --> 14:00.305
¶ I never really
fixed it ¶¶

14:01.474 --> 14:02.240

music playing]

¶

14:10.383 --> 14:11.683
- What's goin' on?

14:11.685 --> 14:14.586
- This is my kind
of music, baby!

14:14.588 --> 14:17.755
- Thunder monitor,
stop the music!

14:17.757 --> 14:20.992
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Activating "Heat Mode."

14:20.994 --> 14:22.427
- [electrical hum]

14:22.429 --> 14:25.396
- My gelato--it's melting.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.332
Melting!

14:27.667 --> 14:30.602
- Don't worry.
I'll save it.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.439
See ya.
[whooshing]

14:34.441 --> 14:37.242
- COLOSSO:
No-o-o-o-o!

14:37.244 --> 14:39.310
- Remember,
we know nothing.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.246
- Why is this happening?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.181
- Yeah, why "is"
this happening?

14:43.183 --> 14:44.716
- Why's the thunder
monitor doing that?

14:44.718 --> 14:47.252
- Yeah, why "is" the thunder
monitor doing that?

14:47.254 --> 14:49.020
- Why are you repeating
everything we're saying?

14:49.022 --> 14:53.024
- Yeah, why "is" we repeating
everything you're saying?

14:57.597 --> 15:04.636
- ¶

15:05.605 --> 15:09.741
- You haven't even thanked me
for picking out the outfits.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.610
- Who are we even
supposed to be?

15:12.612 --> 15:15.713
- The Evil Snorkeler
and the Evil Donut.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.482
- Okay, so you just
took a costume

15:17.484 --> 15:19.083
and added
the word "evil" to it?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.219
- It's not just
for the costumes.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.754
It works for anything.

15:22.756 --> 15:23.721
See? Uh...

15:23.723 --> 15:25.456
the "evil" hockey stick,

15:25.458 --> 15:26.357
"evil" basketball,

15:26.359 --> 15:29.794
"evil" look you're givin'
me right now.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.764
- Okay, if Gideon got
our anonymous tip,

15:32.766 --> 15:33.598
he'll be here any minute

15:33.600 --> 15:35.566
looking for two
equipment-stealing villains.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.102
So, let's just
grab something.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.372
- Stop right there,
evil-doers.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.344
- He looks like
a super-booger.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.646
- Put down those
sporting goods,

15:48.648 --> 15:50.248
or feel my wrath.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.117
- [fake British accent]
Uh-oh, looks like our plan

15:53.119 --> 15:55.486
is under water.
[chuckles]

15:55.488 --> 15:57.155
- You do sound ridiculous.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.523
- [high-pitched]
"Donut" try to stop us,

15:58.525 --> 16:01.092
or we will sprinkle
you with kicks.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.761
- Go, go, Giddler!

16:03.763 --> 16:07.098
- You're no match for the evil--
- Cheese string!

16:07.100 --> 16:09.400
- MAX & PHOEBE:
[gasping]

16:09.402 --> 16:12.370
- MAX: Evil disguises
was your idea.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.672
- PHOEBE: Oh! Oh!
- MAX: Get off me!

16:14.674 --> 16:17.542
- I caught the villains.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.112
Now to alert
the school principal.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.247
Giddy-up!

16:23.550 --> 16:25.550
- [fake British accent]
Foiled by the Giddler.

16:25.552 --> 16:29.887
Now there's only one way--
- Relax! We failed.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.361
- PHOEBE & MAX:
[grunting]

16:36.363 --> 16:38.763
- Stupid donut goggles!

16:38.765 --> 16:40.298
Stupid goggles goggles!

16:40.300 --> 16:43.768
- Hey, if you break those,
I will never get my deposit back

16:43.770 --> 16:47.271
from Pacific Joe's
Scuba and Donut Shack.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.041
- Focus on getting
the bracelet back, okay?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.709
Gideon just defeated
two "supervillains".

16:51.711 --> 16:54.479
Who knows what kind of danger
he's gonna put himself in next.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.314
- BRADFORD: This better
be good, Gideon!

16:56.316 --> 16:59.584
- Quick, our disguises!
- BOTH: [powers whooshing]

17:04.991 --> 17:07.825
- I can't believe
what I'm seeing--

17:07.827 --> 17:09.727
which is a gym
full of nothing.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.730
There's no villains
here, Gideon!

17:14.334 --> 17:18.369
- Ugh, his after school
shorts are even shorter.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.506
- Hm, my Giddy sense
is telling me

17:21.508 --> 17:23.341
they're no longer there,

17:23.343 --> 17:25.076
so, they must be...

17:25.078 --> 17:27.311
somewhere.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.747
- Hm, well, my Bradford
sense is saying--

17:29.749 --> 17:31.549
you're an idiot!

17:37.357 --> 17:38.623
- All right, let's get
back into our disguises

17:38.625 --> 17:42.326
and go down there and steal
that bracelet before they leave.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.398
Okay, it might
take a while.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.804
- ¶

17:52.806 --> 17:56.407
- Hurry up and fix it, Hank.
I'm sweating.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.676
- Oh, you're sweating?

17:58.678 --> 18:00.645
My body is crying.

with the thunder monitor?!

18:29.075 --> 18:30.942
I can't take this anymore!

18:30.944 --> 18:32.143
- Sorry, Barb,
I can't fix it,

18:32.145 --> 18:33.978
if I don't know
what's broken!

18:33.980 --> 18:37.815
This is our life now!
- [wind continues gusting]

18:37.817 --> 18:39.817
- Billy, we have
to end this!

18:39.819 --> 18:41.786
- But I just got
my kite going!

18:41.788 --> 18:44.956
- [wind continues gusting]

18:44.958 --> 18:47.592

the thunder monitor

18:47.594 --> 18:50.461
playing "Rock,
Paper, Laser!"

18:50.463 --> 18:51.462
- You lasered it?!

18:51.464 --> 18:52.830
- Are you yelling
because of the noise,

18:52.832 --> 18:56.400
or because you're
incredibly mad at us?!

18:56.402 --> 18:57.568
- [wind continues gusting]

18:57.570 --> 18:58.536
- I can't believe you kids!

18:58.538 --> 19:00.438
- Hank, we'll...we'll
ground them later!

19:00.440 --> 19:03.441
They told you what happened!
Just fix it!

19:03.443 --> 19:05.743
- They probably lasered
the circuit board,

19:05.745 --> 19:08.412
probably,
and hit the breaker,

19:08.414 --> 19:12.583
and then crossed it
with this thing, and...

19:12.585 --> 19:14.152
- BARB:
Oh!

19:14.154 --> 19:15.686
- ALL:
[laughing, cheering]

19:15.688 --> 19:16.988
- NORA:
All right, Dad!

19:16.990 --> 19:19.857
- Thank goodness
the thunder monitor's fixed.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.859
Now back to
your punishment.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.728
- Remember what
Jebediah said.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.497
"If your young'uns break
the thunder monitor,

19:26.499 --> 19:27.999
you show 'em mercy."

19:28.001 --> 19:29.967
- Oh, my gosh, Barb,
they made it all up!

19:29.969 --> 19:33.804
- I knew Billy reading a book
was too good to be true.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.543
- The villains are here.
I know it.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.478
- That's right.
Keep looking...

19:40.480 --> 19:43.181
so you won't see
this comin'.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.649
- MAX:
Ready to roll.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.217
- Okay, we're gonna need
to very carefully

19:46.219 --> 19:47.652
lower each other down and--

19:47.654 --> 19:50.621
- Ah! Tele-cramp!
- PHOEBE: [gasps]

19:50.623 --> 19:51.923
- [heavy thud]

19:51.925 --> 19:54.759
- Yes! I told you
they were somewhere.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.695
Go, go, Giddler, again!

19:57.697 --> 20:01.165
- [dramatic music]

20:01.167 --> 20:04.468
- What? No! You can't
take my power bracelet!

20:04.470 --> 20:06.504
- I'm the Evil Snorkeler.
I can do anything.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.839
- [high-pitched voice]
You stay outta this!

20:08.841 --> 20:09.740
- Yeah. No. Totally.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.976
I'm not stickin'
my neck out for him.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.245
- Ah! My arm hair!

20:14.247 --> 20:16.547
- I've got it,
Evil Donut. Let's go!

20:16.549 --> 20:17.949
- Give me back
my girlfriend's bracelet!

20:17.951 --> 20:21.652
- [high-pitched] I'm pretty sure
you guys never really dated.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.689
- BRADFORD: Gideon,
you're gonna pay for this!

20:24.691 --> 20:25.389
- Oh, Phoebe, wait!

20:25.391 --> 20:27.658
- Oh, I know what you're
gonna say and you're right.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.659
We should go back
to help Gideon.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.696
- No. I was gonna say I need
to take these flippers off

20:31.698 --> 20:33.130
so I can run faster.

20:33.132 --> 20:33.931
- You saw Bradford.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.167
He's gonna shoot Gideon
with dodgeballs any minute.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.536
- Oh, curse your
jelly-filled logic!

20:38.538 --> 20:40.771
- Let's go before
he gets Boston-creamed.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.107
- Turn it off.
- I can't.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.614
- Any last words?

20:49.616 --> 20:51.549
- Yeah! Enough!

20:51.551 --> 20:52.283
I'm not scared of you.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.119
- Look, Gideon's finally
standing up for himself.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.054
- I may have lost
my power bracelet,

20:57.056 --> 20:59.523
but it left me
with another power--

20:59.525 --> 21:00.958
self-confidence!

21:00.960 --> 21:02.526
- [laughing]

21:02.528 --> 21:04.762
You're the worst!

21:05.698 --> 21:06.597
- The point is...

21:06.599 --> 21:09.000
I'll never take back what
I said about your shorts.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.202
They're gross and weird.

21:11.204 --> 21:12.003
- [gasping]

21:12.005 --> 21:13.838
Then you leave
me no choice.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.941
Dodgenovski, fire!
- [contraption fires]

21:16.943 --> 21:17.942
- GIDEON:
[groans]

21:17.944 --> 21:21.846
- Ooh, that dodgeball
is a part of him now.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.981
- But, Max, look!

21:23.983 --> 21:25.816
- [grunts]

21:25.818 --> 21:27.118
I caught it...

21:27.120 --> 21:28.853
which means you're out!

21:28.855 --> 21:31.689
- BRADFORD:
[yelping]

21:32.992 --> 21:34.992
[laughing]

21:34.994 --> 21:36.327
You missed!

21:36.329 --> 21:37.595
Oh, no.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.996
- Oh, yeah.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.065
Ahhhhhh!
- [contraption fires]

21:41.067 --> 21:42.600
- BRADFORD:
Oh!

21:42.602 --> 21:43.768
- Ahhhhhhh!
- Oh! Oh!

21:43.770 --> 21:45.269
My legs!
- [contraption fires]

21:45.271 --> 21:47.138
- Oh! My beautiful legs!

21:47.140 --> 21:49.140
- [contraption
firing repeatedly]

21:49.142 --> 21:50.775
- Oh, my legs!
[sobbing]

21:50.777 --> 21:53.744
- Oh, I've got to
get in on this.

21:53.746 --> 21:54.912
- Me, too.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.213
- BRADFORD:
Oh! Oh, no!

21:56.215 --> 21:58.616
- [dodgeballs thudding]

21:58.618 --> 22:00.284
- BRADFORD:
Oh! Oh!

22:00.286 --> 22:03.020
Where are all
these balls coming from!

22:03.022 --> 22:04.722
- GIDEON:
[laughing]

22:04.724 --> 22:07.024
- BRADFORD:
Oh, please!

22:10.897 --> 22:26.877
- ¶
