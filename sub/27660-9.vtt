WEBVTT

00:04.341 --> 00:06.010
Previously on
"Future Man"...

00:06.011 --> 00:07.931
- Tiger's a Biotic.
- We're never gonna see her again.

00:07.932 --> 00:09.391
The TTD's destroyed,

00:09.392 --> 00:11.103
so we're trapped
in this time line forever.

00:11.104 --> 00:13.149
We have two days
to stop the attack!

00:13.150 --> 00:14.485
We're all gonna die!

00:14.486 --> 00:15.947
Your whole life
is built on a lie.

00:15.948 --> 00:18.201
You lie every day
to another man's family

00:18.202 --> 00:20.038
and an orphan child.

00:20.039 --> 00:22.585
You know deep down that
their love is for someone else.

00:22.586 --> 00:24.548
At least I have someone else.

00:24.549 --> 00:26.593
Who do you have?

00:29.600 --> 00:31.520
I just put this on my head,
like a hat?

00:31.521 --> 00:33.314
It's not a hat.

00:33.315 --> 00:34.818
Gah!

00:34.819 --> 00:37.699
I know this isn't real,
but I don't care.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.036
I wish I could see
the real you,

00:40.037 --> 00:41.372
if there was a real you.

00:41.373 --> 00:42.750
There is.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.506
This is me.

00:45.507 --> 00:47.635
I can--I can feel you.

00:47.636 --> 00:49.514
- Tiger!
- Stu!

00:49.515 --> 00:51.225
MARS actually stands for

00:51.226 --> 00:53.522
"Mankind's Automated
Reality System."

00:53.523 --> 00:54.816
That's where I took you today.

00:54.817 --> 00:57.362
- Will you come with me?
- Sure.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.709
Joosh?

01:03.710 --> 01:05.211
- I love you so much...
- Bring me this boy.

01:05.212 --> 01:08.093
If anyone tries to stop you,
kill them.

01:30.012 --> 01:32.349
Aww, look at you,

01:32.350 --> 01:34.938
all tentative and fidgety.

01:34.939 --> 01:37.694
Just like the first time
he sowed with us.

01:39.489 --> 01:42.494
You had never even
shot a bucket before.

01:42.495 --> 01:44.958
- At first you were...
- Terrible.

01:44.959 --> 01:47.630
You ate ass
like Lathe eats an All-Nut.

01:47.631 --> 01:48.131
Just...

01:51.848 --> 01:53.559
Before that night,
we were bundled,

01:53.560 --> 01:56.815
but we weren't truly a cluster.

01:56.816 --> 02:01.031
Hey, uh, I'm--
I'm not really in the mood.

02:01.032 --> 02:04.873
This whole
Supreme Overlord thing is

02:04.874 --> 02:07.837
it's pretty tiring.

02:07.838 --> 02:11.761
Kind of takes the poke out
of your spoke, you know?

02:11.762 --> 02:14.726
That's why you need this sow.

02:14.727 --> 02:16.228
Tonight's all about you.

02:16.229 --> 02:18.274
- So get on the nest.
- Close your eyes.

02:18.275 --> 02:20.863
- Open your mouth.
- Put out your hand.

02:20.864 --> 02:23.827
- Arch your back.
- And spread those cheeks.

02:37.271 --> 02:40.360
Sounds like it's time
for "The Muffle Song."

02:42.114 --> 02:44.117

the Muffle Song ♪

Oh, shit!

04:11.544 --> 04:12.753
They're coming!
They're coming for me!

04:12.754 --> 04:14.047
Ah!

04:15.927 --> 04:18.849
Excuse you!

04:18.850 --> 04:21.437
What do you think the bean husk
on the door handle means?

04:21.438 --> 04:23.525
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

04:23.526 --> 04:24.653
I didn't know--

04:29.955 --> 04:31.165
No, no, no, no!

04:33.796 --> 04:35.339
Cum whisk!

04:35.340 --> 04:36.676
Ow!

04:36.677 --> 04:38.054
- Cum bucket!
- Ooh!

04:39.933 --> 04:41.185
I told you!

04:41.186 --> 04:42.479
I told you Pointed Circle
was here

04:42.480 --> 04:45.026
and they were coming after me.

04:45.027 --> 04:46.403
Did you say "cum whisk"?

04:46.404 --> 04:48.074
- Yeah.
- I don't want to know.

04:48.075 --> 04:49.869
Shit. Shit-shit-shit-shit!

04:51.122 --> 04:52.123
What's happening?

04:52.124 --> 04:53.459
They're here to eat us!

04:55.757 --> 04:57.551
I can't fight them
and protect you.

04:57.552 --> 05:00.473
Here, take these chits
to the blind baker.

05:00.474 --> 05:03.187
I'll find you at the pee hole
once I kill everybody.

05:03.188 --> 05:04.732
- You got a secret stash?
- Pee hole?

05:04.733 --> 05:06.193
Oh, shit.

05:06.194 --> 05:07.531
Go! Go!

05:09.033 --> 05:10.911
Oh, shit!

05:13.793 --> 05:15.461
Get out of here!

05:15.462 --> 05:17.591
- Pee hole! Pee hole!
- Okay, pee hole, pee hole.

05:17.592 --> 05:20.722
I'm good at two things,
beating ass and eating ass.

05:20.723 --> 05:23.227
Bad news for you:
chow time's over.

05:26.317 --> 05:27.360
What?

05:29.115 --> 05:30.909
Bio-Techs in the cluster-nest!

05:30.910 --> 05:32.287
No! No!

05:35.503 --> 05:38.299
No! My ab!

05:42.016 --> 05:43.935
I'll eat your face!

05:43.936 --> 05:47.192
- Stay back!
- I'll handle this.

05:47.193 --> 05:49.864
Lock the door!

06:08.569 --> 06:10.112
Oh, "boobs."

06:10.113 --> 06:11.406
"Boobs," come on, Tiger.

06:11.407 --> 06:13.077
Come on. "Boobs."

06:28.316 --> 06:29.902
Uh, let me guess, uh.

06:29.903 --> 06:33.075
Just so I'm clear,
nobody's friends?

06:43.179 --> 06:44.766
Torque!

06:48.983 --> 06:51.946
Wrench?

06:51.947 --> 06:55.954
You never did learn to fight,
you silly son of a bitch.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.548
Giddyup! Giddyup!

07:05.432 --> 07:08.103
Stu...

07:15.452 --> 07:16.871
Pancakes?

07:16.872 --> 07:19.459
- What is this?
- What are you up to?

07:19.460 --> 07:22.758
What--can't a father make
his daughter her favorite meal?

07:24.763 --> 07:26.682
Why are you trying to bribe me?

07:26.683 --> 07:28.477
Bribe? I--

07:28.478 --> 07:29.647
I would never bri--

07:29.648 --> 07:30.982
I just, uh--wanted to celebrate

07:30.983 --> 07:33.530
'cause I have big news.

07:33.531 --> 07:35.116
Drum roll please.

07:37.412 --> 07:40.585
Tiger and I are in love and
she's coming with me to MARS.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.006
What the fuck, Dad!

07:43.007 --> 07:45.427
I know it can be hard
for a child when

07:45.428 --> 07:47.641
their single dad
starts dating again.

07:47.642 --> 07:49.018
Other dads don't date

07:49.019 --> 07:51.732
identical copies
of their children!

07:51.733 --> 07:53.570
I thought you would be happy.

07:53.571 --> 07:56.951
You never wanted to go to MARS
and now you don't have to.

07:56.952 --> 07:58.746
So you just
find a replacement me

07:58.747 --> 08:01.418
and then banish me
to a fiery death on Earth?

08:01.419 --> 08:03.297
I--I thought
this is what you wanted.

08:03.298 --> 08:05.050
I can't win for trying with you.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.346
Look, come to MARS,
don't come to MARS.

08:07.347 --> 08:11.021
The point is, there comes
a time in every parent's life

08:11.022 --> 08:13.860
when they have to let
their little girl grow up.

08:13.861 --> 08:17.283
And I know you're only 34,
but now is that time.

08:24.883 --> 08:29.265
She's vulnerable,
just like I was.

08:29.266 --> 08:31.896
But in time, she'll see...

08:31.897 --> 08:34.610
right through you.

08:34.611 --> 08:39.578
And she'll realize
all this talk of "being human"

08:39.579 --> 08:43.878
is just as empty as this space
where your heart should be.

08:51.812 --> 08:54.440
You wouldn't say all that
if you didn't really love me!

09:28.510 --> 09:31.515
It's my job.

09:31.516 --> 09:34.480
Exclusively.

09:47.924 --> 09:49.050
Where you going?

09:49.051 --> 09:50.887
To find a new cluster.

09:50.888 --> 09:52.348
Maybe no cluster.

09:52.349 --> 09:54.812
Some place where
I can be chill again.

09:54.813 --> 09:58.986
Hopefully far from you.

09:58.987 --> 10:01.199
Wait, wait.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.623
You're not the one
who should leave.

10:04.624 --> 10:06.210
I am.

10:08.841 --> 10:11.804
I tried to tell you this once
but I didn't go far enough.

10:11.805 --> 10:14.100
I'm not the man you think I am.

10:14.101 --> 10:17.064
Literally.
This is not a metaphor.

10:17.065 --> 10:20.070
For too long, I've hidden
behind a wall of metaphors.

10:20.071 --> 10:22.199
Shit, there I go again.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.788
So you're not Torque?

10:24.789 --> 10:27.376
Correct.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.675
I tried to be him, because...

10:30.676 --> 10:34.933
well, being him meant
that I could love all of you

10:34.934 --> 10:36.854
and be loved by you.

10:36.855 --> 10:40.612
And goddamn it, I've never
experienced a love so pure.

10:40.613 --> 10:42.574
It blinded me.

10:42.575 --> 10:48.293
And now, now my sins have been
visited upon this cluster-nest.

10:48.294 --> 10:53.470
And for that, I am--
I'm so sorry.

10:53.471 --> 10:55.140
So...

10:55.141 --> 10:57.896
do you know where
the real Torque is?

10:57.897 --> 10:59.148
N-no.

10:59.149 --> 11:00.275
Where do you think he is?

11:00.276 --> 11:01.570
I don't know.

11:01.571 --> 11:03.406
Uh, I've never met him.

11:03.407 --> 11:06.162
But if I did meet him,

11:06.163 --> 11:10.213
I would tell him he's
the luckiest man who ever lived.

11:14.681 --> 11:17.770
His dick was
a lot bigger than yours.

11:18.939 --> 11:19.982
I know.

11:21.862 --> 11:23.614
I know.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.749
Oh, and, uh,

11:28.750 --> 11:32.924
try to break this
to Lugnut gently.

11:32.925 --> 11:37.016
Tell her I was
burned to death or something.

11:53.049 --> 11:54.383
Waffles?

11:54.384 --> 11:55.970
Uh, I'll take it to go.

11:55.971 --> 11:58.726
- To go?
- I had a whole evening planned.

11:58.727 --> 12:00.270
Oh, well, I just gotta go

12:00.271 --> 12:01.941
check on something.
It's probably nothing.

12:01.942 --> 12:04.780
If it's probably nothing,
why don't you stay?

12:04.781 --> 12:07.326
Or--or go.
Check two things.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.040
Whatever makes you happy.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.710
Hey, hey, um.

12:11.711 --> 12:13.673
When I get back,
maybe we can, um,

12:13.674 --> 12:18.139
put this robot arm to better use
than just making waffles.

12:18.140 --> 12:20.102
Oh.

12:20.103 --> 12:21.438
- All right.
- Yeah.

12:24.779 --> 12:26.447
That was weird, right?

12:26.448 --> 12:28.536
Totally weird.

12:28.537 --> 12:30.497
I mean, right after
I send my kill-mandos

12:30.498 --> 12:32.126
to abduct her friend Joosh,

12:32.127 --> 12:34.171
all of a sudden
she's got to check something?

12:34.172 --> 12:36.300
Am I wrong?

12:36.301 --> 12:39.348
You are 100% right
in everything you're feeling,

12:39.349 --> 12:42.187
all the time.

13:08.032 --> 13:09.701
Burned alive?

13:09.702 --> 13:12.164
Yeah.

13:12.165 --> 13:16.380
I, uh, I just
didn't want to hurt you.

13:16.381 --> 13:19.596
I always knew
you weren't Papa Torque.

13:19.597 --> 13:22.644
At first,
I thought it was weird,

13:22.645 --> 13:24.564
but then I saw
how much you cared

13:24.565 --> 13:26.610
and it didn't bother me
so much anymore.

13:26.611 --> 13:28.823
Wow.

13:28.824 --> 13:30.701
You are one adaptable kid.

13:30.702 --> 13:32.539
I want to come with you.

13:35.546 --> 13:37.674
Um, come here.

13:41.933 --> 13:44.270
Where I'm going,

13:44.271 --> 13:46.900
you can't come.

13:46.901 --> 13:50.658
Papa Tor--

13:50.659 --> 13:54.039
Wolf is gonna do some bad things
to some bad people.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.045
I could close my eyes.

13:57.046 --> 14:00.385
No, you're gonna have to
make do with just five parents.

14:00.386 --> 14:02.891
Okay, little lady?

14:02.892 --> 14:05.145
You might be better off.

14:05.146 --> 14:07.274
I'm kind of
flying blind here as a dad.

14:10.239 --> 14:13.036
If I could absorb
all the world's pain

14:13.037 --> 14:18.129
before it touched you,
I'd do it.

14:18.130 --> 14:20.968
But I also cut a guy's arm off
like ten minutes ago,

14:20.969 --> 14:23.097
so I'm kind of
a mixed bag parent-wise.

14:25.436 --> 14:27.356
You're a real catfucker.

14:27.357 --> 14:30.739
- Yeah.
- Well, you got that right.

14:32.826 --> 14:36.875
Your other parents
may not understand you,

14:36.876 --> 14:39.004
but they love you.

14:39.005 --> 14:41.636
And they'll keep you safe.

14:52.281 --> 14:54.703
I'm sorry, Lug.

14:54.704 --> 14:56.665
I gotta go.

15:00.256 --> 15:01.675
Wolf!

15:05.767 --> 15:09.023
I love you.

15:09.024 --> 15:12.030
I love you too, Lug.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.713
Funny how her little errand

15:20.714 --> 15:23.635
just happens to take her
beyond your camera range.

15:23.636 --> 15:25.556
She's playing you for a fool.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.518
She's gonna leave you.

15:27.519 --> 15:29.898
Right after
you let her inside you.

15:29.899 --> 15:31.651
Oh, I guess she got
what she wanted,

15:31.652 --> 15:34.532
and now it's wham-bam,
thank you, hologram.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.910
No.

15:35.911 --> 15:39.208
No, that was real.
She felt it too.

15:39.209 --> 15:41.170
Your kill-mandos failed.

15:41.171 --> 15:43.341
Killed by who?

15:43.342 --> 15:46.932
Her flesh-and-blood
boyfriend, Wolf!

15:46.933 --> 15:49.228
They're holding hands
and tongue-kissing right now,

15:49.229 --> 15:51.357
and Joosh is headed there
to watch.

15:52.694 --> 15:55.365
- Why would he watch?
- No! No.

15:55.366 --> 15:57.035
Tiger and I are meant
to be together.

15:57.036 --> 15:59.791
Our love is bound
to cross time and death itself.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.795
Tiger.

16:01.796 --> 16:03.966
- Oh, my God, I'm so...
- Oh, God.

16:03.967 --> 16:05.636
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Oh.

16:05.637 --> 16:07.557
Futturman, what are you--
what are you doing?

16:07.558 --> 16:09.602
- Kill them.
- Kill them now.

16:09.603 --> 16:12.065
No court in the land
would convict you.

16:12.066 --> 16:13.442
Oh, God.

16:13.443 --> 16:16.240
Wolf boobs'd me like 15 times.

16:16.241 --> 16:19.496
- Yeah, no.
- No, those--those are my boobs.

16:19.497 --> 16:21.835
Oh.

16:21.836 --> 16:24.841
All right, well,
what the fuck happened to you?

16:24.842 --> 16:28.181
So much.

16:28.182 --> 16:30.603
So much, I--
I was a slave.

16:30.604 --> 16:32.314
I was a dog.

16:32.315 --> 16:34.484
Everyone's been trying
to kill me since I got here.

16:34.485 --> 16:35.779
And they found me.
They came after me.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.449
W--who?

16:37.450 --> 16:39.579
- The Pointed Circle.
- All right, they are there,

16:39.580 --> 16:41.207
inside the NAG,
and they came after me.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.710
I barely made it out
with my life.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.714
Okay, well, what--
what about Wolf?

16:44.715 --> 16:45.758
Where's Wolf?

16:46.802 --> 16:48.095
I knew it!

16:48.096 --> 16:49.849
They're all laughing at you!

16:49.850 --> 16:51.603
Laughing at you!

16:51.604 --> 16:54.567
You know what you need to do.

16:54.568 --> 16:58.074
- Launch the kill drone.
- Oh--oh.

16:58.075 --> 17:00.663
I can't believe she
would do this to me.

17:00.664 --> 17:03.459
I'm begging you, please,

17:03.460 --> 17:05.296
please, let me
come live with you.

17:05.297 --> 17:07.217
- What is happening right now?
- Please.

17:07.218 --> 17:09.681
I promise, I'll be--
I'll be a good boy.

17:09.682 --> 17:12.269
Okay, I'll be quiet--you won't
even have to use the muzzle.

17:12.270 --> 17:13.814
I promise, okay?

17:13.815 --> 17:15.441
I--I don't care
if you're a Biotic.

17:15.442 --> 17:16.945
I really--I don't care.

17:16.946 --> 17:18.949
Kill them!
Kill them both right now.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.368
Me...

17:20.369 --> 17:23.625
me and PUP-E,
we won't need much.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.169
Jesus.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.463
There's no such
thing as true love.

17:26.464 --> 17:27.675
Do it already!

17:27.676 --> 17:28.760
- Your dog days are over.
- Come on.

17:28.761 --> 17:30.179
- Really?
- Come on, yeah.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.725
- Oh, God, thank you so much.
- Ohh.

17:31.726 --> 17:34.062
- Yeah, we'll go to Stu's.
- Stu?

17:34.063 --> 17:35.566
That's where you've been
this whole time?

17:35.567 --> 17:37.193
- Yeah.
- He's the best.

17:37.194 --> 17:38.739
He's gonna save everyone--

17:38.740 --> 17:40.868
I mean, everyone who's
willing to be saved.

17:40.869 --> 17:42.370
Oh, we're going to
MARS tomorrow.

17:42.371 --> 17:44.124
- You should come.
- No.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.253
- Tomorrow's the attack.
- Stu's got it under control.

17:46.254 --> 17:47.673
Wha--what about Wolf?

17:47.674 --> 17:48.967
Forget Wolf.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.138
Our future's with Stu.

17:52.350 --> 17:54.186
Launch--
launch the welcome drone!

17:57.694 --> 18:00.031
What'd I tell you?

18:00.032 --> 18:02.662
True love always wins.

18:02.663 --> 18:05.585
Yeah. Yeah.

18:18.235 --> 18:20.071
Oh, my God, air-conditioning.

18:20.072 --> 18:24.454
Yeah, you like that?

18:24.455 --> 18:26.668
Real food.

18:28.631 --> 18:30.718
Oh, my God...

18:35.269 --> 18:37.480
Why? Why?

18:39.820 --> 18:42.449
Aloha, Joosh!

18:42.450 --> 18:45.288
Welcome to my world.

18:45.289 --> 18:47.334
Ah, orange.

18:51.092 --> 18:54.473
Wow, you're--
you're so Stu-like.

18:54.474 --> 18:57.395
The Krona-bomber in the flesh.

18:57.396 --> 19:00.026
You don't look like America's
most dangerous terrorist.

19:00.027 --> 19:01.780
No, I've seen him fight.

19:01.781 --> 19:03.993
Absolutely harmless.

19:06.957 --> 19:10.756
- Huh.
- Are you making yourself taller?

19:10.757 --> 19:13.469
I mean, I--I know it's like,
you know, the real you,

19:13.470 --> 19:17.310
but you just look
so, like, solid.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.151
Oh.

19:21.152 --> 19:22.780
You think this is weird
for you?

19:22.781 --> 19:25.828
For years, you were
the star of my nightmares.

19:25.829 --> 19:29.042
And now, here you are.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.421
Your eyes looked so much
colder and harder

19:31.422 --> 19:33.092
in those courtroom sketches.

19:33.093 --> 19:35.304
No, there's nothing hard
about Josh Futturman.

19:35.305 --> 19:37.225
No, nothing hard.

19:37.226 --> 19:39.564
Okay, I think he gets
the point, Tiger, thanks.

19:39.565 --> 19:43.195
- You look hungry.
- That one's real.

19:43.196 --> 19:45.283
Is there like a--
a labeling system or something?

19:45.284 --> 19:46.828
Well, Stu has a vision.

19:46.829 --> 19:49.499
He wants, uh,
our world and his world

19:49.500 --> 19:51.796
to seamlessly be integrated.

19:51.797 --> 19:53.465
Oh, so I'm supposed to
just, like, smush my hand

19:53.466 --> 19:54.927
through everything to see
if it's real or not, or...

19:54.928 --> 19:56.556
Small price to pay
for equality.

19:56.557 --> 19:59.227
- Yeah. Have a drink.
- You're probably thirsty.

19:59.228 --> 20:02.026
You have no idea.

20:06.326 --> 20:08.203
- That's fucked up, guys.
- I love juice.

20:08.204 --> 20:10.542
- Yeah.
- It never gets old.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.378
- No, I know, I know. I know.
- I keep waiting.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.882
You should see what
he can do with furniture.

20:13.883 --> 20:14.926
Yeah.

20:18.935 --> 20:22.148
Is--is there something
going on between you two?

20:22.149 --> 20:24.486
- Well...
- No, no-no-no-no-no-no,

20:24.487 --> 20:26.741
no, no, we don't--
we don't know what it is.

20:26.742 --> 20:29.287
The Germans call it
komputaboinken.

20:29.288 --> 20:31.834
- Ha.
- Oh.

20:31.835 --> 20:34.422
Uh, okay, okay, congratulations.

20:34.423 --> 20:38.598
I'm, uh, I'm...

20:38.599 --> 20:40.519
Now, I know why I'm here

20:40.520 --> 20:42.856
and I know that
Tiger came with Wolf.

20:42.857 --> 20:45.277
But the question remains,

20:45.278 --> 20:47.992
how are you out of jail
and in my living room,

20:47.993 --> 20:50.371
150 years in the future?

20:50.372 --> 20:52.458
Well.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.214
Don't ever say
I come to a party

20:55.215 --> 20:56.551
empty-handed.

20:57.679 --> 20:59.264
Boom.
Big entrance.

20:59.265 --> 21:01.728
- Wolf! Welcome.
- I've been expecting you.

21:01.729 --> 21:03.773
- No, you haven't.
- Have too.

21:03.774 --> 21:06.486
My cameras picked you up the
moment you set foot on the Mons.

21:06.487 --> 21:08.700
Your theatrics, while amusing,

21:08.701 --> 21:10.077
are highly unnecessary.

21:10.078 --> 21:11.496
What are you doing here?

21:11.497 --> 21:12.708
I am not going back
to that doghouse.

21:12.709 --> 21:13.918
No way, no how.

21:13.919 --> 21:15.922
I am finally a human again.

21:15.923 --> 21:19.137
- I'm not here for you.
- I'm here for him.

21:19.138 --> 21:21.684
- Me?
- Pourquoi?

21:21.685 --> 21:24.815
You send dark suits
into my cluster-nest,

21:24.816 --> 21:27.654
where my husbands
and my wives sleep,

21:27.655 --> 21:30.952
where my kinda-daughter
plays with her stick,

21:30.953 --> 21:33.875
into my cluster-nest!

21:33.876 --> 21:36.338
Oh, you bored?

21:36.339 --> 21:38.258
Look at the bracelet
on that arm.

21:38.259 --> 21:40.429
Does that look familiar?

21:40.430 --> 21:42.308
You could have
chopped that off of anybody.

21:42.309 --> 21:44.688
You think I just go around
chopping off hands for kicks?

21:44.689 --> 21:47.443
Yep, all the time.

21:47.444 --> 21:48.905
Okay, fair enough.

21:48.906 --> 21:50.491
Guys,
that's not important, okay?

21:50.492 --> 21:52.203
It doesn't matter who's right
or who's wrong

21:52.204 --> 21:54.959
or whose arm that is.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.796
Okay, we have bigger problems
at hand.

21:56.797 --> 21:59.552
Are you really gonna cast your
lot with this techno-weenie?

21:59.553 --> 22:03.308
Oh, I compiled 139
devastating comebacks to that,

22:03.309 --> 22:05.437
but I'm gonna take
the virtual high road.

22:05.438 --> 22:07.066
What do you care
what I do?

22:07.067 --> 22:09.070
You gave up on me
a long time ago.

22:09.071 --> 22:11.993
Lifetimes of fighting
side by side,

22:11.994 --> 22:13.412
and you just threw it all away
because of

22:13.413 --> 22:16.001
something that doesn't matter:
genetics.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.504
Yeah.

22:17.505 --> 22:19.299
Well, maybe if you had
a little more faith

22:19.300 --> 22:21.679
and told me the truth
from the beginning.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.434
What, when you were
bleeding out in a bean field?

22:24.435 --> 22:26.313
My ears weren't bleeding!

22:26.314 --> 22:28.442
Stop it!

22:28.443 --> 22:31.782
God, for once, just
stop fighting and listen to me.

22:31.783 --> 22:34.037
Every since I got here,
I've been ignored,

22:34.038 --> 22:35.874
I've been abused,
I've been disregarded,

22:35.875 --> 22:37.168
I've had bags
thrown over my head.

22:37.169 --> 22:38.713
We're 150 years in the future

22:38.714 --> 22:41.343
and we're still throwing
bags over people's heads?

22:41.344 --> 22:44.600
Jesus Christ, you guys
are not each other's enemies.

22:44.601 --> 22:46.520
The real enemy is
the Pointed Circle,

22:46.521 --> 22:49.108
and for all we know, they're
trying to kill us as we speak.

22:49.109 --> 22:51.739
And Achilles is
launching his attack tomorrow.

22:51.740 --> 22:53.660
- We're all in danger.
- Stu won't let that happen.

22:53.661 --> 22:56.373
I don't give a fuck what
Stu is gonna do or not do.

22:56.374 --> 22:58.043
Let's not
cut Stu out just yet.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.254
You know what, Stu?

22:59.255 --> 23:01.258
We are all very impressed.

23:01.259 --> 23:02.761
Okay?
You are a hologram.

23:02.762 --> 23:04.515
You have this big, fancy
all-white house.

23:04.516 --> 23:05.809
And you made yourself
a little bit taller.

23:05.810 --> 23:08.021
Congratulations.
Don't give a fuck.

23:08.022 --> 23:10.527
This is between the three of us.
You do not matter.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.749
What happened to you two?

23:17.750 --> 23:21.298
You guys used to be a team.
We used to be a team.

23:21.299 --> 23:22.425
I matter!

23:22.426 --> 23:24.178
I swear to fucking God, Stu!

23:24.179 --> 23:25.849
You open your mouth
one more goddamn time,

23:25.850 --> 23:27.519
I'm gonna shove
this holographic food

23:27.520 --> 23:29.188
down your holographic throat!

23:33.657 --> 23:36.453
Hey.

23:36.454 --> 23:37.956
Stu?

23:37.957 --> 23:39.877
Stu, are you okay?

23:45.388 --> 23:47.224
You want to live or die?

23:47.225 --> 23:48.393
Uh, live.

23:53.697 --> 23:55.575
Oh!

23:55.576 --> 23:57.495
Then you better come with me.

23:57.496 --> 23:59.499
Neither one of you were
getting out of here alive.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.044
I'll explain later.

24:01.045 --> 24:02.881
My dad will be back online
any second.

24:02.882 --> 24:04.551
What--what about Tiger?

24:04.552 --> 24:06.555
- Well, she's loyal to Stu.
- You wanna save her?

24:06.556 --> 24:08.100
We gotta stop him.

24:08.101 --> 24:09.520
Who are you?

24:09.521 --> 24:11.691
I'm Achilles.
