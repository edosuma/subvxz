02:15.703 --> 02:17.425
The world is reeling.

02:17.525 --> 02:21.184
Errol Flynn, movie star, matinee idol,
notorious ladies' man,

02:21.284 --> 02:23.645
is dead at the age of 50.

02:23.745 --> 02:25.313
The hero of a generation,

02:25.413 --> 02:29.151
equally known for his swashbuckling
in public and in private.

02:29.251 --> 02:33.422
He died true to form, in the arms
of a much younger girlfriend.

02:33.522 --> 02:38.095
Now, all of America is asking,
"Who is the girl?"

02:57.511 --> 02:59.383
Just got a few questions out here.

03:00.649 --> 03:02.117
Just a couple questions.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.619
All right,
first let's all just move back

03:04.719 --> 03:06.855
and give Miss Aadland some room,
would you, please?

03:06.955 --> 03:08.590
- Miss Aadland!
- Miss Aadland! There she is!

03:08.690 --> 03:10.559
Is it true that Errol Flynn
died in your arms?

03:10.659 --> 03:12.594
- What were his last words?
- How long had you known him?

03:12.694 --> 03:14.229
Miss Aadland,
are you going to the funeral?

03:14.329 --> 03:16.631
Miss Aadland, did Flynn leave you
anything in his will?

03:16.731 --> 03:17.794
Miss Aadland!

03:18.665 --> 03:20.733
- Beverly!
- How old are you?

03:20.833 --> 03:22.399
- Bev!
- Are you going to the funeral?

03:22.499 --> 03:23.672
Beverly.

03:23.772 --> 03:26.138
Miss Aadland, what were
you doing in Vancouver?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.643
Don't push! Don't push!

03:28.843 --> 03:31.179
- She's gonna faint.
- Beverly!

03:31.279 --> 03:32.978
Please, just get back!

03:33.280 --> 03:34.493
Hey!

03:35.249 --> 03:36.964
Beverly!

03:40.354 --> 03:41.521
What was your relationship...

03:57.771 --> 03:59.341
The girl fainted.

03:59.441 --> 04:02.629
Yeah, it's a pretty crazy scene
over here.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.543
Hey, let me call you back later.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.552
Excuse me, ma'am.

04:10.652 --> 04:11.853
- Are you the mother?
- Yes.

04:11.953 --> 04:14.656
Hi, I'm Tedd Thomey, here's my card.
I was wondering if you could just...

04:14.756 --> 04:17.226
- A few questions about your daughter?
- I'm in a hurry. I...

04:17.326 --> 04:18.793
Is it true that she was mentioned
in the will?

04:18.894 --> 04:21.196
Well, he wanted to make sure
she was very well looked after.

04:21.296 --> 04:22.531
Well, do you think she's pregnant?

04:22.631 --> 04:24.099
- Pregnant?
- We just saw her faint.

04:24.199 --> 04:27.035
We're talking a big age difference here,
do you think that they were in love?

04:27.135 --> 04:31.473
Oh, head over heels in love, yes.
I mean, it was her first love, and his last.

04:31.573 --> 04:35.312
I couldn't have done anything to stop it,
even if I wanted to. It was all predestined.

04:35.412 --> 04:40.140
Mrs. Aadland, look this way.
Here, take this. And dab your eye.

04:41.148 --> 04:44.632
- Looks great. Thanks.
- Do you need another one?

05:04.471 --> 05:07.542
- Baby, are you close?
- Going as fast as I can.

05:07.642 --> 05:10.194
- Let me see.
- Hold on.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.885
I thought we agreed on the bolero dress,
the Paula Lynn.

05:16.985 --> 05:18.299
What's wrong with this?

05:18.399 --> 05:22.654
Nothing. It's adorable, but it
makes you look too young. Trust me.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.696
Now, this is much better.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.944
- They're here already.
- All right, Herb.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.535
Here you go.

05:33.635 --> 05:37.105
I've canceled your dance class
for the next three weeks.

05:37.205 --> 05:40.386
But you can still make the acting class
as long as you don't go over time.

05:40.486 --> 05:42.777
- Do I have to?
- Yes, you do.

05:42.877 --> 05:44.746
I said I'd go bowling
with some of the gang.

05:44.846 --> 05:47.182
Well, never mind about that.

05:47.282 --> 05:50.285
You know, Mrs. Morgan is so excited.

05:50.385 --> 05:54.687
She couldn't believe when I told her
that you were in a movie with Gene Kelly.

05:55.724 --> 05:59.427
- I'm only in the chorus line.
- I know, but that's just for now.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.531
I mean, what's that Natalie Wood
girl have, that you don't have?

06:02.631 --> 06:05.664
- Cab's waiting.
- All right, Herb.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.471
- Now, remember your manners...
- But don't fade into the woodwork.

06:09.571 --> 06:11.437
That's my girl. Beautiful.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.940
- Bye bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.721
Excuse me,
may I talk to you for a moment?

06:59.821 --> 07:01.379
Sure.

07:01.479 --> 07:04.058
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.

07:04.158 --> 07:08.697
I'm Orry Kelly, doing costumes on Too Much,
Too Soon over on stage eight,

07:08.797 --> 07:12.267
and there's a certain someone over there,
who would very much like to meet you.

07:12.367 --> 07:15.239
- Who?
- Errol Flynn.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.553
You know who he is, don't you?

07:17.753 --> 07:19.313
Sure.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.523
Robin Hood.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.883
- Are you decent?
- Never, come in.

07:45.899 --> 07:50.505
Hello, there. I'm Errol Flynn,
and who might you be?

07:50.605 --> 07:53.241
I'm Beverly Aadland.
Pleased to meet you.

07:53.341 --> 07:57.512
Pleased to meet you.
And what exactly do you do, Miss Aadland?

07:57.612 --> 07:59.013
Actor, singer, dancer.

07:59.113 --> 08:02.350
Really? All three, that's extraordinary.
Triple threat, yes.

08:02.450 --> 08:04.684
I envy you, I never could dance myself.

08:04.784 --> 08:07.322
- Or sing.
- Or act.

08:07.422 --> 08:10.091
How long have you been
in this profession, Miss Aadland?

08:10.191 --> 08:11.593
Forever, pretty much.

08:11.693 --> 08:14.546
- A seasoned professional.
- I guess.

08:14.646 --> 08:18.216
- I'd better be going.
- What? No, no, no, no. Stay, Orry. Stay.

08:18.316 --> 08:22.417
Isn't she an exquisite creature?
She'd be perfect, don't you think?

08:23.053 --> 08:25.921
Yes. Yes, Errol. Perfect.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.465
Aadland residence.

08:33.565 --> 08:35.066
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>
- Hi.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.902
I can't make acting class tonight.
I have an audition.

08:38.001 --> 08:40.871
- <i>What kind of an audition?</i>
- It's for a play.

08:40.972 --> 08:44.107
"Master of" something.
It's with Errol Flynn.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.937
- Who?
- <i>Errol Flynn.</i>

08:47.845 --> 08:50.048
- Don't be nervous, just be yourself.
- Okay.

08:50.148 --> 08:52.150
<i>- And don't smoke in front of him.</i>
- Okay, Mom.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.352
- Be a good listener.
- Okay, okay.

08:54.452 --> 08:55.587
- Okay.
<i>- Bye.</i>

08:55.687 --> 08:57.186
<i>Bye.</i>

09:01.324 --> 09:04.059
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.

09:04.828 --> 09:08.066
You'll get a kick out of this lodge
where we're going. It's a...

09:08.166 --> 09:11.668
It belongs to Huntington Hartford,
he's the producer of the play.

09:12.604 --> 09:15.563
Yes, my wife and I are separated.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.609
And he took pity
on this homeless vagabond.

09:28.885 --> 09:30.955
I'll be sad to leave it.

09:31.055 --> 09:36.391
Every good, true vigorous feeling I have,
gathers impulsively around him.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.163
I know, I must conceal my sentiments.

09:39.263 --> 09:43.701
I must smother hope. I must remember
that he cannot care much for me.

09:43.801 --> 09:47.457
I must repeat continually,
that we are forever sun... sunder...

09:47.557 --> 09:49.606
- Sundered!
- Sundered.

09:49.706 --> 09:52.125
- Sundered.
- Very good.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.365
Very good, indeed.

09:55.278 --> 09:57.142
Do you like that speech?

09:59.716 --> 10:01.250
Well...

10:01.818 --> 10:04.209
I think it's kind of corny.

10:06.389 --> 10:07.803
It is, isn't it?

10:09.693 --> 10:13.264
<i>Come on. There must have been
something that made you feel suspicious.</i>

10:13.364 --> 10:16.935
<i>Well, if it turns out to be one of us,
I'm gonna wring his rotten red neck.</i>

10:17.035 --> 10:19.538
- <i>Yeah, maybe you are wringing it.</i>
- I'll get it.

10:19.638 --> 10:22.407
<i>I'm a first class
United States American, see?</i>

10:22.507 --> 10:24.906
<i>Don't even hint I got...</i>

10:28.278 --> 10:30.764
- Aadland residence.
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

10:30.864 --> 10:33.751
- How's it going?
- Everything's fine, we're having dinner.

10:33.851 --> 10:36.287
Dinner? Well, then the audition
must have gone very well.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.353
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

10:38.722 --> 10:42.460
It's just the two of you,
he's not getting any funny ideas, is he?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.662
Mom, of course not.

10:44.762 --> 10:46.898
<i>You come straight home afterwards.</i>

10:46.998 --> 10:50.702
Okay, there's someone
who wants to say hello to you.

10:51.202 --> 10:55.473
<i>Hello, is this the charming mother
of a very charming young lady?</i>

10:55.573 --> 10:58.040
I'd recognize that voice anywhere.

10:58.876 --> 11:02.280
Very nice to meet you
over the phone, Mrs. Aadland.

11:02.380 --> 11:05.277
I would love to meet you in person, though.
Perhaps you could come round to the lodge,

11:05.377 --> 11:07.285
sometime next week.

11:07.485 --> 11:09.654
Thank you. That sounds lovely.

11:09.754 --> 11:12.657
<i>Wonderful. I'll have my man call you
and make all the arrangements.</i>

11:12.757 --> 11:15.193
- It's a plan.
- Who is it?

11:15.293 --> 11:17.161
It's the producer of the play.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.831
What the hell play is auditioning
at this hour?

11:21.187 --> 11:22.197
<i>We're chasing...</i>

11:24.369 --> 11:26.771
Are you sure you won't have
some champagne?

11:26.871 --> 11:29.573
It'll make the movie
go down much easier.

11:29.673 --> 11:31.375
No, thank you.

11:35.078 --> 11:37.111
Okay, maybe I will.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.329
All right.

11:42.052 --> 11:44.586
You've seen it this color before?

11:44.721 --> 11:46.656
Millions of times.

11:46.756 --> 11:50.191
- Millions?
- It's a figure of speech.

11:52.529 --> 11:55.708
You're like a little sprite.
You know that?

11:55.808 --> 11:59.067
A wood nymph.
Has anyone ever told you that?

11:59.536 --> 12:01.339
- No.
- Oh, definitely.

12:01.439 --> 12:05.009
Yes, in fact, I think
I'm going to call you Woodsey.

12:05.409 --> 12:07.645
- Do you like that?
- I don't know.

12:07.745 --> 12:10.561
Would you think about it
and let me know?

12:11.548 --> 12:14.616
- Thanks, Woodsey.
- I didn't say "yes," yet.

12:15.052 --> 12:18.790
But it's such a perfect name for you.
Woodsey.

12:18.890 --> 12:20.477
I don't think so.

12:20.777 --> 12:23.224
Oh, Woodsey,

12:24.928 --> 12:27.562
you have to face your destiny.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.616
My destiny.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.926
You're extraordinary.

13:07.570 --> 13:08.997
Errol.

13:28.358 --> 13:30.711
You got any smokes?

13:31.094 --> 13:32.463
No.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.830
There's a gas station down on Sunset.

13:37.267 --> 13:40.601
- Can we stop?
- Sure.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.704
You okay?

13:43.506 --> 13:44.988
Yeah.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.810
Yeah, I guess.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.986
Is he like that with all the girls?

13:59.489 --> 14:01.056
What do you mean?

14:04.361 --> 14:06.351
That's what I thought.

14:16.039 --> 14:18.764
Oh, baby, I was so worried.

14:19.376 --> 14:20.978
- Hi.
- How was it?

14:21.078 --> 14:22.513
Oh, it was fine.

14:22.613 --> 14:25.550
- Yeah?
- I don't think I got the part, though.

14:25.650 --> 14:28.817
Why do you say that? He took you to dinner,
you must be in the running.

14:28.919 --> 14:31.455
- I guess.
- So what's he like, Errol Flynn?

14:31.955 --> 14:34.892
He was nice. He talked a lot.

14:34.992 --> 14:38.529
- And were you a good listener?
- Yes, I was.

14:38.629 --> 14:41.096
But I'll talk to you about it later,
I'm really tired.

15:00.717 --> 15:02.186
I've seen all your movies.

15:02.286 --> 15:06.257
The Sea Hawk was my favorite.
I saw it, like, five times.

15:06.357 --> 15:08.359
Really? I could barely
get through it once.

15:08.459 --> 15:11.963
Oh, but you're such a great actor,
Mr. Flynn. Thank you.

15:12.263 --> 15:14.999
Woodsey, I've been
looking for you all day.

15:15.099 --> 15:18.435
I wanted to ask you out
for dinner, if you...

15:18.535 --> 15:22.640
Look, I'm terribly sorry that things
got so out of hand at the audition.

15:22.740 --> 15:24.442
Is that what it was? An audition?

15:24.542 --> 15:29.777
Look, I'm so sorry.
I mistook you completely.

15:29.879 --> 15:33.881
- I didn't realize...
- I'm late.

15:36.386 --> 15:38.760
Well, why haven't you seen him?

15:39.522 --> 15:41.292
He's on a different soundstage.

15:41.392 --> 15:44.195
Well, when you do see him,
I want you to remind him

15:44.295 --> 15:46.228
that I'm very excited about meeting him.

15:47.664 --> 15:49.767
- He did say he wanted to meet me.
- Okay.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.503
Yeah, okay. Well...

15:52.603 --> 15:56.237
Make sure that you have lunch,
you're getting too skinny.

15:57.407 --> 16:01.045
One and two and three and four.

16:01.145 --> 16:05.213
One and two and three and four.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.126
Sorry to intrude, ladies.

16:49.226 --> 16:52.493
Now at last I find out
where you've been hiding.

16:52.662 --> 16:55.396
I was hoping to have a word
with Miss Aadland.

16:57.033 --> 16:58.767
If you don't mind.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.539
Excuse us, please.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.743
Who was that?

17:08.044 --> 17:09.611
Here.

17:14.584 --> 17:18.788
Beverly, I can't stop
thinking about you.

17:18.887 --> 17:22.093
I lie awake, nights. Really.
I... I haven't slept in days.

17:22.193 --> 17:24.662
I don't understand what the point is.
You already got what you wanted.

17:24.762 --> 17:26.742
What I want is to get to know you,
to spend time with you,

17:26.843 --> 17:29.133
enjoy your company, that's all.

17:29.233 --> 17:32.803
Look, I know my reputation
precedes me, but I promise you,

17:32.903 --> 17:34.939
whatever you've read in the press,

17:35.039 --> 17:40.276
I swear, the man standing before you now,
is a different animal entirely.

17:40.376 --> 17:42.243
Please, believe me.

17:45.582 --> 17:47.105
What's that?

17:47.984 --> 17:50.819
Oh, it's a... It's a question mark.

17:51.287 --> 17:54.491
Yes, I know. Why?

17:54.591 --> 17:57.561
Because I question everything.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.765
Even at my age,
I'm still trying to figure it all out.

18:00.865 --> 18:04.368
I... just never believe
what I've been told.

18:04.468 --> 18:06.804
Someone tells me, "You can't do that,"
I say, "Why the hell not?"

18:06.904 --> 18:10.541
And then I go ahead and bloody well do it,
and I get into a bit of trouble.

18:10.641 --> 18:14.075
But I'm just endlessly curious.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.150
I'm especially curious about you.

18:31.594 --> 18:33.898
- Who is it?
- Hi, Mrs. Aadland. It's Tedd Thomey.

18:33.998 --> 18:37.835
- If I could just ask you a few questions.
- Why don't you all go to hell?

18:37.935 --> 18:41.839
It's Tedd Thomey, ma'am. We met
at the airport. I gave you my card.

18:41.939 --> 18:45.540
Yeah, I'm not a reporter,
I'm the guy that writes the books.

18:46.676 --> 18:49.246
Look, I know it's been
a difficult time for you, ma'am.

18:49.346 --> 18:52.647
I'm a straight-up guy,
I won't misrepresent you.

18:55.318 --> 18:58.489
Things have been so crazy
since Errol died.

18:58.989 --> 19:01.122
It's been a very hard time for me.

19:03.626 --> 19:07.695
- I was very close to him, too, you know.
- I can understand, yeah.

19:09.532 --> 19:13.568
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I have an artificial leg.

19:14.449 --> 19:17.205
My so-called handicap

19:17.840 --> 19:20.858
in an accident, many years ago.

19:22.011 --> 19:23.946
I'm sorry.

19:26.049 --> 19:29.584
I assume you've been reading
all the BS they've been printing.

19:30.153 --> 19:32.268
I mean, they just take your words
and they twist them around

19:32.368 --> 19:34.258
until you say whatever
it is they want you to say.

19:34.358 --> 19:39.327
- Yeah. That's the gutter press for you.
- I know. I know, but...

19:39.830 --> 19:42.957
I'm worried that Bev will see it.

19:44.988 --> 19:46.634
Where is Beverly?

19:47.437 --> 19:49.279
She's...

19:50.273 --> 19:53.044
She's staying with Errol's lawyer.

19:53.144 --> 19:57.680
He has a real swanky pad
with a gate and everything and...

19:57.780 --> 20:00.551
- it keeps the press away.
- The press.

20:00.951 --> 20:04.889
You know what, Mrs. Aadland?
Forget about what the press are saying.

20:04.989 --> 20:08.292
This book is the chance
to tell your side of the story.

20:08.392 --> 20:11.028
It'll put it down
for the record permanently.

20:11.428 --> 20:14.729
And I'm certain you have
a great story to tell me.

20:18.601 --> 20:21.168
Okay, let's get started.

20:23.106 --> 20:26.210
Just speak normally, relax. I'm gonna
start with a few questions here...

20:26.310 --> 20:28.345
Well, there's one thing
I wanna make clear right off,

20:28.445 --> 20:32.616
and that is that my baby was a virgin
the day she met Errol Flynn

20:32.716 --> 20:35.519
and nothing makes me sicker
than those dried up old biddies

20:35.619 --> 20:39.490
who don't have any of the facts,
but they make all these snide remarks

20:39.590 --> 20:42.204
and make it seem like my daughter,
Beverly, was a bad girl

20:42.304 --> 20:46.330
for what she did with Errol, which...
nothing could be further from the truth.

20:46.430 --> 20:49.764
And I ought to know, because I'm her mother
and she told me everything.

20:50.836 --> 20:53.369
Oh, God. Oh, God.

20:53.469 --> 20:57.960
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

21:00.209 --> 21:02.143
It's amazing.

21:08.018 --> 21:12.453
Woodsey, you realize you're
bringing out my best work in years.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.058
These past few weeks,

21:17.293 --> 21:20.961
have been heaven.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.570
For me, anyway.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.103
I'm not complaining.

21:30.540 --> 21:35.309
So, you do like me, just a little?

21:37.547 --> 21:39.680
You're growing on me.

21:40.884 --> 21:43.852
You are a cheeky little
wood nymph, aren't you?

21:47.757 --> 21:49.896
What time is your mother
expecting you home?

21:49.996 --> 21:52.016
Not until 5:00.

21:53.162 --> 21:55.367
All right, that's good.

21:55.698 --> 21:58.366
You told her dance class again?

21:59.369 --> 22:02.903
I told her I had to stay
and practice the new routine.

22:04.074 --> 22:07.508
Well, that's... that's true, isn't it?

22:08.912 --> 22:11.047
I need more practice.

22:11.147 --> 22:12.734
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.222
- Why not?
- Oh, Woodsey,

22:17.687 --> 22:23.953
this is the monstrosity in love, lady,
that the desire is boundless,

22:24.053 --> 22:27.898
and the act, a slave to limit.

22:27.998 --> 22:30.433
Who said that? William Shakespeare?

22:30.533 --> 22:33.301
Yes, how did you guess?

22:34.004 --> 22:35.506
It sounded corny.

22:35.606 --> 22:37.970
Yeah. You...

22:40.276 --> 22:46.414
<i>Some say that happiness is hard to find</i>

22:47.617 --> 22:49.991
<i>Some say they'd never...</i>

22:52.121 --> 22:55.457
Hey, Beverly.
Did you go to Hollywood High?

22:55.557 --> 22:59.427
- Yeah. Why?
- Nothing.

23:01.564 --> 23:03.800
Just drop you at the
end of the street again?

23:03.900 --> 23:05.466
Sure.

23:07.804 --> 23:14.545
<i>Some say that life is a mystery</i>

23:14.645 --> 23:21.151
<i>Some say that love brings only misery</i>

23:21.251 --> 23:24.355
<i>I felt the same thing</i>

23:24.455 --> 23:27.758
<i>And I thought it was true</i>

23:27.858 --> 23:32.960
<i>But that was before I met you</i>

23:36.733 --> 23:38.501
Thanks, old boy.

23:38.701 --> 23:40.436
Errol?

23:41.272 --> 23:44.751
Well, it's just... It's about Beverly.

23:44.851 --> 23:48.579
It's just... I thought she looked familiar
the first time I saw her,

23:48.679 --> 23:54.214
but I didn't say anything and now I realize
that could have been a mistake.

23:54.584 --> 23:56.915
What is it, Ronnie? Just spit it out.

23:57.287 --> 23:59.808
She went to the same high school I did.

24:00.591 --> 24:05.826
But she wasn't in my grade,
she was a couple grades below me.

24:09.699 --> 24:14.838
I'm sorry. I feel stupid,
it took me so long to figure it out,

24:14.938 --> 24:19.076
but really, she seemed a lot older. I mean,
she's really good at looking the part.

24:19.176 --> 24:22.043
I don't know why
I didn't remember her sooner.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.518
Don't beat yourself up, Ronnie.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.922
It's not your job
to monitor my love life.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.255
I know.

24:37.827 --> 24:42.031
Well, I'll be inside
if you need anything.

24:42.131 --> 24:43.865
Right.

24:46.903 --> 24:50.774
<i>Out of the blue, Errol called
and he asked us up to the lodge.</i>

24:50.874 --> 24:54.278
<i>That's not the kind of invitation
you get every day, I'll tell you.</i>

24:54.378 --> 24:56.880
<i>My husband Herb, was away
on business, in Arizona.</i>

24:56.980 --> 25:02.750
<i>So, we didn't have any transport.
But Errol, very gallantly, sent his car.</i>

25:03.119 --> 25:04.621
- Mom.
- What?

25:04.721 --> 25:07.088
- Come on.
- Okay.

25:36.385 --> 25:39.122
- There you are, you made it.
- Yeah.

25:39.222 --> 25:41.362
Beverly, how nice to see you again.

25:42.325 --> 25:44.859
And who is this, your sister?

25:46.128 --> 25:48.499
I've waited weeks
for this, Mrs. Aadland.

25:48.599 --> 25:50.968
Oh, please, call me Flo.

25:51.068 --> 25:53.437
Flo it is then.
Would you like a drink, Flo?

25:54.365 --> 25:58.542
Yes, please.
I'll take a vodka on the rocks.

25:58.642 --> 26:02.846
Perfect. Vodka is also
my poison of choice.

26:02.946 --> 26:05.415
Beverly, why don't you...
Why don't you find a soda?

26:05.515 --> 26:07.918
It's in the kitchen, which is
down the stairs and to the left.

26:08.018 --> 26:09.317
Okay.

26:12.788 --> 26:16.693
She's amazing, your daughter.
I want you to tell me all about Beverly.

26:16.793 --> 26:18.562
She's been in show business
for a while, hasn't she?

26:18.662 --> 26:21.125
Oh, she has been a pro since she was 12.

26:21.225 --> 26:25.035
Here, and in Vegas.
She was the Pears Soap baby.

26:25.135 --> 26:30.441
And then at three, she won a contest for
a knock-out impersonation of Bette Davis.

26:30.541 --> 26:33.277
"Fasten your seat belts,
it's going to be a bumpy night?"

26:33.377 --> 26:36.744
It was, "I'd like to kiss you,
but I just washed my hair."

26:38.782 --> 26:43.842
And then, five, her first film.
The Story of Nylon, Technicolor.

26:43.942 --> 26:47.211
She's just... She was born
to be a performer.

26:47.311 --> 26:50.694
You don't have to convince me, Flo.
I saw it right away.

26:50.794 --> 26:54.164
She's one of the brightest,
most unaffected,

26:54.264 --> 26:57.531
natural talents, I have seen in years.

26:58.267 --> 27:00.234
- Oh, please, sit down, won't you?
- Oh, thank you.

27:02.505 --> 27:04.370
The thing is...

27:05.241 --> 27:07.945
If there's a way,
I would really like to help her.

27:08.045 --> 27:11.341
- You know, get her career going full-steam.
- Really?

27:11.441 --> 27:14.351
There's so many people in this town,
friends of mine who have influence,

27:14.451 --> 27:16.520
you know, that I could introduce her to.

27:16.620 --> 27:21.992
And I could say, "This is my discovery.
My protégée, so to speak."

27:22.092 --> 27:25.061
That is, with your approval.

27:25.161 --> 27:27.629
- Of course.
- Splendid.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.565
I never got you your drink.

27:33.703 --> 27:36.873
There is one thing, Florence.

27:36.973 --> 27:39.417
The other day,
my assistant told me that...

27:39.517 --> 27:43.313
he thought he remembered Beverly from
high school and that she's not yet 18.

27:43.413 --> 27:45.179
Is that true?

27:47.783 --> 27:48.806
Yes.

27:50.486 --> 27:53.954
- How old is she?
- She's 15, Errol.

27:57.293 --> 28:01.299
You know, that could be
very dangerous for Beverly.

28:02.099 --> 28:06.736
If the studios found out that
she's underage, she could be blackballed.

28:06.836 --> 28:07.878
Blackballed?

28:08.378 --> 28:13.777
Oh, yes. They're real sticklers for the
rules these days. Not like in my time.

28:13.877 --> 28:15.988
- Well, they won't find out.
- No?

28:16.088 --> 28:18.426
No, she has a birth certificate
that says she's 18.

28:18.526 --> 28:20.984
- It's a good one, too.
- Is it?

28:21.084 --> 28:23.454
Yes, she was dancing in Vegas
when she was 13

28:23.554 --> 28:27.624
and no one ever suspected anything
and she could pass for 20 now.

28:27.724 --> 28:31.325
Well, that's exactly
the age I took her for.

28:32.762 --> 28:37.234
It occurs to me that if I were
to take Woodsey under my wing,

28:37.334 --> 28:40.170
we'd naturally be seen
around town a lot.

28:40.270 --> 28:43.306
And the press in this country,
the free press is...

28:43.406 --> 28:48.011
Well, they have such filthy minds,
they could make it rather difficult for us.

28:48.111 --> 28:52.115
- Even when nothing is going on?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

28:52.215 --> 28:54.918
Well, that's frustrating.
I mean, that's not fair.

28:55.118 --> 28:58.352
No, it's not. But I've had an idea, Flo.

28:58.888 --> 29:01.692
What if you were to come along
with us, when we're out?

29:01.792 --> 29:04.558
You know, be a part of the group.

29:05.961 --> 29:09.866
- Well, that's a swell idea.
- You are her mother, after all.

29:09.966 --> 29:13.332
We'd just be...
We'd just be three friends,

29:13.432 --> 29:17.104
out on the town,
having a wonderful time.

29:18.574 --> 29:20.499
Well, that sounds like fun.

29:21.243 --> 29:22.779
Splendid.

29:24.446 --> 29:26.349
Are you out of your fucking mind?

29:26.449 --> 29:29.653
Yeah, you bet.
And loving every minute of it.

29:29.753 --> 29:32.289
Does the mother even know
what's going on?

29:32.389 --> 29:36.490
Well, you know, mothers see
what mothers want to see.

29:38.761 --> 29:40.856
Here you are, sport.

29:41.764 --> 29:44.501
Oh, you're flying too close
to the sun, my friend.

29:44.601 --> 29:47.170
Your wings will get burned,
you're gonna fall down to earth,

29:47.270 --> 29:50.073
and you're gonna land in this
nasty little place called jail,

29:50.173 --> 29:52.609
which you barely escaped in '42.

29:52.709 --> 29:55.579
That was a show trial,
I was a big star then, I'm not anymore,

29:55.679 --> 29:59.383
so the DA doesn't care about me.
And I don't give a damn about him.

29:59.583 --> 30:02.519
And besides, Beverly is not a gold digger,
like those girls were.

30:02.619 --> 30:06.223
But she is underage
and the public never forgets.

30:06.323 --> 30:08.889
You don't have to remind me, sport.

30:09.558 --> 30:14.498
I live with it every day.
"In like Flynn." It'll be my epitaph.

30:14.798 --> 30:17.733
That's exactly why they're gonna
throw the book at you.

30:17.833 --> 30:19.834
And the studio
can't protect you anymore.

30:20.669 --> 30:25.939
Belli, you're a lawyer and I pay you
quite handsomely to think like that.

30:26.041 --> 30:29.943
But at the end of the day,
I don't give a damn.

30:30.079 --> 30:31.682
Do you know what doctor once told me,

30:31.782 --> 30:36.153
that if I didn't give up the drink
and the drugs and the wild ways,

30:36.253 --> 30:38.755
I'll have six months to live.

30:38.855 --> 30:44.426
That was 10 years ago,
and I've lived every day and night

30:44.526 --> 30:47.436
as if it was my last.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.563
That's what I love about you, Baron.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.633
I really do.

30:53.235 --> 30:55.636
But now you're gonna listen to me.

30:56.071 --> 31:00.373
Statutory rape, that's hard time.

31:14.690 --> 31:15.841
Look at that...

31:15.941 --> 31:20.460
<i>I began to see that there was a real
chemistry between Errol and Beverly.</i>

31:22.599 --> 31:25.335
<i>He was so eager to please her,
to do things for her</i>

31:25.435 --> 31:29.636
<i>like she was a big star
and he was her youthful admirer.</i>

31:34.977 --> 31:39.315
<i>I went everywhere with them and met
the best Hollywood had to offer.</i>

31:39.415 --> 31:41.820
<i>The crème de la crème.</i>

31:54.496 --> 31:56.633
- Hello?
- Hello, Woodsey.

31:56.733 --> 32:00.570
Oh, hi, Errol, I love the music box,
it's so sweet.

32:00.670 --> 32:03.573
I'm so glad. Something about it
made me think of you.

32:03.673 --> 32:06.476
Listen, my love, is this is a good time?

32:06.576 --> 32:09.212
- Sure.
- Put her on.

32:09.332 --> 32:11.840
Mom, pick up.

32:13.816 --> 32:14.867
Hello.

32:14.967 --> 32:18.221
Florence, hi. Listen,
I hope I'm not interrupting your dinner.

32:18.321 --> 32:22.091
Oh. No, no, not at all,
we just finished.

32:22.391 --> 32:25.358
How are you? Bev, hang up the phone.

32:25.995 --> 32:27.430
How are you doing?

32:27.530 --> 32:32.135
Not well, Florence, not well at all.
I have to leave on Monday for New York.

32:32.235 --> 32:34.938
- Oh, really?
- It's that damn play.

32:35.038 --> 32:39.442
I've committed myself to it and I'm stuck.
I really don't want to go.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.161
But, listen, I've had an idea,

32:41.261 --> 32:44.064
why don't you take some clothes
and things and throw them in a suitcase,

32:44.164 --> 32:48.385
take the baby by the hand and join me,
there in New York, soon as possible.

32:48.485 --> 32:49.753
Errol, stop joking.

32:49.853 --> 32:51.855
No, I'm not joking at all,
I'm deadly serious.

32:51.955 --> 32:54.921
I want to launch Beverly's career
in New York.

32:55.090 --> 32:59.459
You'll be there as a chaperone.
I'll take care of everything of course.

33:00.963 --> 33:04.298
That's a very generous idea, but...

33:04.533 --> 33:06.169
I have to give it some thought.

33:06.269 --> 33:09.239
No, no, don't think about it really,
Florence. Just do it, come on.

33:09.339 --> 33:14.077
Come as soon as you can. It'll be wonderful
for Beverly, I mean just think of it.

33:14.177 --> 33:17.214
New York? What are you talking about?

33:17.666 --> 33:19.783
There are some people
who took interest in Bev

33:19.883 --> 33:24.219
and they could really
move her career along.

33:24.319 --> 33:27.089
Yeah, like who?

33:27.189 --> 33:28.498
Errol Flynn.

33:30.259 --> 33:31.328
What?

33:31.428 --> 33:34.196
Yeah, he's been helping
her out with her career.

33:34.296 --> 33:38.235
She's 15 years old.
I mean, Lord knows what's gone on.

33:38.335 --> 33:40.203
Oh, nothing's gone on.
It's perfectly innocent.

33:40.303 --> 33:42.339
- I've been there, I've seen them together.
- Flo. Flo, Flo.

33:42.439 --> 33:45.242
Errol Flynn is a walking penis.

33:45.342 --> 33:48.211
- Oh, no that's not...
- He can't keep his hands off of young girls.

33:48.411 --> 33:51.582
- Okay, so he's interested in her talent?
- Yes.

33:51.682 --> 33:53.617
Oh, wake up, woman.

33:53.717 --> 33:57.420
She's a chorus girl,
she's a so-so singer and she's...

33:57.520 --> 34:00.897
- She can't act her way out of a paper bag.
- You know, you don't know anything.

34:00.997 --> 34:05.328
I know. I'm not letting you
take Beverly to New York,

34:05.428 --> 34:09.065
to be served on a platter
to a man like Errol Flynn.

34:09.165 --> 34:14.967
Listen, Beverly's whole life has been
about one thing and one thing only,

34:15.068 --> 34:17.072
and that's show business.

34:17.172 --> 34:21.344
You don't understand the difference
that just a little helping hand

34:21.444 --> 34:25.547
from a director or a producer
or a big star like Errol can make.

34:25.648 --> 34:29.252
It makes the difference between
those who make it, who really make it

34:29.351 --> 34:33.989
and those that are left behind on the
garbage heap, the has-beens, the wannabes.

34:34.090 --> 34:37.059
This is her shot, you can't say no.

34:37.159 --> 34:40.696
If you do, she's gonna resent you
for the rest of her life,

34:40.795 --> 34:43.068
and I will, too.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.600
You owe me this.

34:49.972 --> 34:51.739
Oh, Flo.

34:52.373 --> 34:55.188
You always had your way with that girl.
You kept me out...

34:55.288 --> 34:57.548
I never kept you out of it,
you weren't in it because...

34:57.648 --> 34:59.513
Let me finish!

35:00.113 --> 35:01.891
Damn you!

35:04.586 --> 35:06.553
Take her if you want.

35:07.589 --> 35:09.345
But that's it.

35:10.092 --> 35:14.094
I'll wash my hands of the both of you.
You're on your own.

35:40.089 --> 35:43.894
Oh, look, Bev. I've always wanted
to come to New York.

35:44.927 --> 35:49.530
You know, not many mothers
would do what I'm doing.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.566
I know.

35:54.169 --> 35:55.750
I love you, Mom.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.873
Oh, I love you too, baby.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.147
Mom.

36:07.983 --> 36:11.551
Errol wanted me to talk to you
about the sleeping arrangements.

36:13.121 --> 36:14.924
Okay.

36:15.025 --> 36:19.626
He wanted me to tell you that I'd be
sleeping in his room most nights.

36:20.329 --> 36:23.166
- What?
- It's the way he wants it.

36:23.266 --> 36:26.517
That may be the way he wants it, but that
doesn't mean that's what he's going to get.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.902
Mom, come on.

36:30.139 --> 36:32.072
He's Errol Flynn.

36:34.409 --> 36:37.480
- You better not say anything.
- Don't tell me what to do. I trusted you.

36:37.580 --> 36:39.582
- Mom, don't embarrass me.
- Just stop whining.

36:39.682 --> 36:43.016
- Yes.
- Yes, we are here to see Mr. Errol Flynn.

36:45.220 --> 36:48.589
It was leaving for Hong Kong.
So, we got on it...

36:50.296 --> 36:52.263
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

36:52.363 --> 36:54.027
Woodsey.

36:55.164 --> 36:57.200
- Everyone, may I have your attention.
- May I take your coat?

36:57.300 --> 37:00.903
I wish to present the marvelous
Mrs. Florence Aadland

37:01.003 --> 37:04.874
and her exquisite daughter, Beverly.
It's their first time in New York.

37:04.974 --> 37:09.245
- So I hope you give them a warm welcome.
- Welcome.

37:09.345 --> 37:11.144
- Hello, Beverly.
- Hello.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.716
- Oh, God, I missed you.
- I missed you.

37:13.816 --> 37:16.683
- Thank God you're here.
- I'll put these in the closet, ma'am.

37:17.252 --> 37:20.690
- Hey, there, I'm John Ireland.
- The actor?

37:20.930 --> 37:22.723
Yes, indeed.

37:23.091 --> 37:25.161
Your daughter's very lovely.

37:25.261 --> 37:27.861
Yes, thank you.

37:32.467 --> 37:35.972
Hello, Florence. I know.
I know you're angry with me

37:36.072 --> 37:38.373
and you have every reason to be.

37:38.473 --> 37:42.012
- I am the devil incarnate.
- I could have you thrown in jail.

37:42.112 --> 37:45.174
- Please, don't joke about this.
- I'm not joking. You lied to me.

37:45.274 --> 37:49.486
You blatantly lied to me, to my face
about what you were up to with my baby.

37:49.586 --> 37:54.057
I thought it was perfectly obvious.
What did you want me to say?

37:54.157 --> 37:56.759
That I was in over my head
with your daughter?

37:56.859 --> 37:59.929
Your beautiful clever daughter.
Whom you've groomed so carefully

38:00.029 --> 38:03.132
- to seem older than her years?
- Oh, now, I'm the one to blame?

38:03.232 --> 38:07.737
No. No. No. No more than I am.
But, if I deceived you

38:07.837 --> 38:11.838
you deceive me as well,
not to mention the rest of Hollywood.

38:15.477 --> 38:17.222
Florence.

38:19.581 --> 38:23.753
I love Beverly as much as
I've ever loved anyone.

38:23.853 --> 38:29.059
And for some reason she loves me,
really loves me.

38:29.159 --> 38:34.227
So, please, try to find it in your heart
to forgive me for both our sakes.

38:34.529 --> 38:40.200
And I think if you'll admit it, you always
knew what was going on, didn't you?

38:41.737 --> 38:43.539
All right, what are you
love birds doing in here?

38:47.143 --> 38:49.746
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, we're just, catching up.

38:49.846 --> 38:51.526
Right, Flo?

38:54.416 --> 38:57.954
So here we are. Enough for everyone.

38:58.054 --> 39:01.658
<i>Seeing them together again
I realized that it was a love match.</i>

39:01.758 --> 39:05.028
<i>I saw that he genuinely
cared for her, very much,</i>

39:05.128 --> 39:09.766
<i>but as I turned it over and over in my mind
I realized it could go either way.</i>

39:10.366 --> 39:13.636
<i>The liaison with Errol could be
very good for Beverly's career,</i>

39:13.736 --> 39:16.606
<i>but it could also be a disaster.</i>

39:16.706 --> 39:20.610
<i>They weren't married after all, and if
the press realized what was going on,</i>

39:20.710 --> 39:22.945
<i>it would be a page one scandal.</i>

39:23.045 --> 39:24.776
<i>I knew we were playing
with dynamite here</i>

39:24.876 --> 39:28.418
<i>and it all had to be handled
very carefully.</i>

39:28.518 --> 39:33.453
<i>I didn't want our lives turning
from an A picture into a B movie.</i>

39:39.494 --> 39:43.363
Look darling, Dag Hammarskjöld,
he's a great man.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.471
- You know who he is?
- Yes.

39:48.571 --> 39:49.839
Who is he?

39:49.939 --> 39:52.842
He works at the United Nations,
he's like a secretary.

39:52.942 --> 39:56.910
- Yes, secretary-general to be precise.
- Yeah.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.782
I am going to get you a tutor
while you're here.

39:59.882 --> 40:04.119
- No, tutors are boring.
- Well...

40:04.219 --> 40:06.122
I like things just the way they are.

40:06.222 --> 40:09.392
Well, I'm gonna get you some
decent books to read at any rate.

40:09.492 --> 40:13.463
Something with a little more
literary merit than the funnies.

40:13.563 --> 40:17.517
Oh, no, come on, don't spoil it.

40:17.899 --> 40:19.669
It's the most fun I've ever had.

40:20.069 --> 40:23.538
Really, you don't miss
Los Angeles, your friends?

40:23.638 --> 40:27.977
No. I'm like a windup toy there.

40:28.077 --> 40:31.648
Go to this audition, go to this dance class,
go to this voice coach...

40:31.848 --> 40:34.681
- Do you even like show business?
- Yes.

40:34.816 --> 40:37.487
- Really?
- Kind of. It's fun.

40:37.587 --> 40:39.720
There sure are a lot of
swelled heads around though.

40:41.524 --> 40:43.590
You might say that.

40:45.694 --> 40:48.828
What I really want
is to just be with you,

40:49.931 --> 40:52.398
and do fun things

40:52.534 --> 40:55.368
and go out and stay in.

40:55.704 --> 40:58.807
And just be free for once in my life.

41:00.675 --> 41:03.710
You examine me, Miss Eyre.

41:03.878 --> 41:07.147
- You think me handsome?
- No, sir.

41:08.918 --> 41:10.612
By my word,

41:10.712 --> 41:14.602
there is something singular about you.

41:15.090 --> 41:19.142
When one asks you
a question you... you...

41:20.295 --> 41:22.799
You rap out a round rejoinder,

41:22.899 --> 41:27.534
which if not blunt, is at least brusque.

41:28.203 --> 41:31.174
Sir, I beg your pardon,
I spoke too plain.

41:31.474 --> 41:34.544
I ought to have replied that beauty
is of little consequence,

41:34.644 --> 41:36.212
or something of the sort.

41:36.312 --> 41:39.715
You ought to have replied no such thing.
Beauty of little consequence, indeed.

41:39.815 --> 41:43.249
Indeed. Indeed.

41:45.353 --> 41:49.425
And so, under the pretense of softening,

41:49.525 --> 41:51.961
your previous outrage now,

41:52.061 --> 41:55.331
you stick a penknife under my ear.

41:55.431 --> 41:58.665
What fault do you find with me, pray?

42:00.335 --> 42:02.853
I can't believe it.

42:06.074 --> 42:10.012
- Who does this clown think he is?
- I told you not to read that.

42:10.112 --> 42:12.882
They never ever a kind word, if they did,
they probably misspell it.

42:13.682 --> 42:17.720
Goes after the actress, too.
You should have used Bev.

42:19.121 --> 42:23.793
Well, I had a really
disastrous day myself.

42:23.893 --> 42:26.896
I'm sorry, what happened?

42:26.996 --> 42:31.032
I got a letter from Bev's father
asking me for a divorce.

42:31.132 --> 42:35.201
- And he's not giving us a penny.
- Oh, that's terrible.

42:36.237 --> 42:39.305
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

42:39.541 --> 42:41.677
You know, I was mad for that man.

42:41.777 --> 42:45.580
I met him when he was the bartender
at the Roosevelt Hotel.

42:45.680 --> 42:50.516
I was a waitress working for tips and
going up for auditions whenever I could.

42:51.086 --> 42:55.621
- You were an actress?
- No, I was a dancer.

42:56.659 --> 42:59.626
And not half bad, actually.

43:00.629 --> 43:02.764
I got a callback
for a Fred and Ginger movie.

43:02.864 --> 43:04.931
- Really?
- Yes.

43:06.468 --> 43:09.638
One night after work
we were going up Highway 1,

43:09.738 --> 43:12.475
to this little beach
that we liked and, oh,

43:12.575 --> 43:16.712
we'd been drinking,
and Herb took a turn too quickly

43:16.812 --> 43:20.249
and the next thing I knew,
I was in the hospital

43:20.349 --> 43:24.073
and the doctor was telling me
that he'd taken off my leg.

43:24.719 --> 43:26.582
Poor thing.

43:27.227 --> 43:28.757
That's awful.

43:28.857 --> 43:31.099
But when Bev was born,

43:31.526 --> 43:36.065
she was such a special child,

43:36.365 --> 43:42.435
and I felt as if she had been
given to me to make up for my leg.

43:43.171 --> 43:47.952
- Of course.
- It was as if it had been pre-ordained.

43:48.052 --> 43:53.066
Everything that has gone on
has felt as if it was...

43:53.166 --> 43:55.181
pre-ordained.

43:57.452 --> 44:01.424
You've done a marvelous job
raising Woodsey.

44:01.524 --> 44:06.025
No, no, you are a superb mother.

44:07.696 --> 44:11.230
- Thank you. I tried.
- Yeah.

44:12.001 --> 44:15.268
My own mother was a class A cunt.

44:15.570 --> 44:17.273
- Errol. Oh.
- Oh, no, no.

44:17.373 --> 44:21.574
She did despicable things
to me and to my father.

44:21.910 --> 44:24.277
Destructive woman.

44:25.080 --> 44:29.384
Yeah, I'm sure Mr. Freud would say that
she had a large hand in shaping my

44:29.484 --> 44:31.487
distinctive attitude toward women.

44:31.587 --> 44:34.457
But you're a gentleman among gentlemen.

44:34.757 --> 44:40.827
Florence, I am and always will be,
quite literally, an absolute son of a bitch.

44:42.531 --> 44:45.134
- Cheers.
- And you know it. Cheers.

44:45.234 --> 44:48.167
- To hell of a day.
- To hell of a day.

44:49.003 --> 44:53.009
- So, what happened next?
- Well, then after the play closed,

44:53.109 --> 44:57.680
Errol's luck changed and he got a call
from the top director, John Huston,

44:57.780 --> 45:01.017
who asked him to be in his new film,
The Roots of Heaven

45:01.117 --> 45:05.521
and that starred Juliette Gréco
and Orson Welles.

45:05.621 --> 45:09.056
The only bad thing was
that it was in Africa.

45:16.831 --> 45:20.503
<i>Woodsey, it's incredible to me
that love would exist</i>

45:20.603 --> 45:24.106
<i>between a man my age and one so young.</i>

45:24.206 --> 45:28.578
<i>But I do so want to believe that you mean
what you've been writing to me.</i>

45:28.678 --> 45:32.048
<i>It might seem unbelievable
that a man as masculine as Errol</i>

45:32.148 --> 45:37.383
<i>would weep while writing a love letter,
but there's no doubt that he did.</i>

45:40.121 --> 45:41.529
<i>Beverly loved those letters,</i>

45:41.629 --> 45:45.127
<i>they were the only thing
that kept her going with him away.</i>

45:45.227 --> 45:47.764
<i>But afterwards,
she just missed him more.</i>

45:48.564 --> 45:51.334
<i>And then something happened
that took us both by surprise,</i>

45:51.434 --> 45:54.070
<i>Errol landed a part for Bev in the film,</i>

45:54.170 --> 45:57.857
<i>but it turned out,
that old fox had a trick up his sleeve.</i>

45:57.972 --> 46:00.710
- I'm sorry, no.
- Mom, come on.

46:00.810 --> 46:04.614
It will be a cold day in hell
before I let you go that far without me.

46:04.714 --> 46:07.216
It's not my fault that he could only
get them to pay for one ticket.

46:07.316 --> 46:08.951
Yeah, I'm sure he tried very hard.

46:09.051 --> 46:13.355
- Please, please, please...
- Baby, just stop it. Just stop it.

46:13.455 --> 46:17.593
This isn't a day trip to the Santa Monica
Pier that we're talking about here.

46:17.693 --> 46:19.995
But I would be with Errol,
you know he'd look after everything...

46:20.095 --> 46:24.567
There are bugs and animals and diseases
and God knows what else.

46:24.667 --> 46:26.936
Well, fine. I'll just go,
you can't stop me.

46:27.036 --> 46:29.338
You just try it, missy,
and you see how far you get.

46:29.438 --> 46:33.306
Mom, it's a big movie with major stars.

46:34.309 --> 46:38.681
I have to say I'm really amazed you'd
want me to pass up an opportunity like this,

46:38.781 --> 46:41.514
it goes against everything
you've ever taught me.

46:42.350 --> 46:44.884
Unless you don't think I'm up to it.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.953
That's ridiculous.

46:48.723 --> 46:51.546
<i>So she went to Africa, all that way,</i>

46:51.646 --> 46:57.096
<i>and she would write me these wonderful
little postcards saying how hot it was.</i>

46:57.398 --> 47:00.870
<i>All of the cast and crew came down
with dysentery except for Errol,</i>

47:00.970 --> 47:03.603
<i>who was avoiding drinking water.</i>

47:09.410 --> 47:13.583
<i>I stayed on in New York and picked up
a job in a nearby movie theater.</i>

47:13.683 --> 47:16.952
<i>The pay wasn't bad
and the people were all right.</i>

47:17.052 --> 47:18.754
<i>One week they were playing Errol's movie</i>

47:18.854 --> 47:22.492
<i>and I really got a hoot
out of telling folks all about him.</i>

47:23.092 --> 47:26.529
<i>In the end I decided to go home
to California and wait for Beverly.</i>

47:26.629 --> 47:31.964
<i>And when she came back we clicked into
our routine just like she'd never been away.</i>

47:33.201 --> 47:35.438
- That's Katonga.
- Katonga, okay.

47:35.538 --> 47:38.173
- He was so nice.
- Sweet.

47:39.575 --> 47:42.244
- Is that a rat?
- No, no. That's Riki.

47:42.344 --> 47:45.111
- Oh, Riki?
- He was my pet mongoose.

47:47.181 --> 47:49.519
- Oh, God, looks like so much fun.
- It was.

47:50.219 --> 47:53.254
I ate so much,
the desserts were so good.

47:53.654 --> 47:55.621
This was our hotel.

47:56.624 --> 47:58.158
And here's us in Madrid.

47:59.394 --> 48:02.008
We didn't stay there for very long.

48:02.797 --> 48:07.136
- This is the Mediterranean Sea.
- Oh, so calm.

48:07.236 --> 48:08.838
Yeah, I know.

48:08.938 --> 48:11.740
This is on Errol's yacht,
the Zaca, in Majorca.

48:11.840 --> 48:14.293
- Such a beautiful boat.
- So beautiful.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.413
I almost forgot,

48:17.313 --> 48:20.316
I have a little, welcome home...

48:20.416 --> 48:22.517
Just a little something for you.

48:22.617 --> 48:25.327
Thank you. That's so sweet.

48:28.056 --> 48:30.661
It's a Paula Lynn.

48:30.825 --> 48:33.793
Oh, that's nice thank you, Mom.

48:35.730 --> 48:38.801
Of course, if you don't really
care for it, you can exchange it.

48:38.901 --> 48:40.336
- No. No, I really like it.
- My feelings won't be hurt.

48:40.436 --> 48:43.293
- It's really pretty. I like it.
- Fine.

48:43.393 --> 48:45.404
Florence.

48:45.673 --> 48:48.042
- Errol.
- Drink?

48:48.344 --> 48:50.746
Why not, what are we drinking?

48:50.846 --> 48:53.719
We're drinking your health, of course.

48:54.315 --> 48:56.586
- So nice to see you.
- Thank you.

48:56.686 --> 49:00.689
I can hardly believe that we actually
made it back in one piece

49:00.789 --> 49:04.457
from the bowels of darkest Africa.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.826
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

49:06.995 --> 49:08.870
You're younger.

49:09.198 --> 49:11.467
- Doesn't Woodsey look well?
- Beautiful.

49:11.567 --> 49:14.770
Light of my life. Fire of my loins.

49:14.870 --> 49:17.773
- You remember where that's from?
- That book by Nabokov.

49:17.873 --> 49:20.208
You see how I'm educating her.

49:20.308 --> 49:23.075
Yes, well...

49:23.511 --> 49:27.680
Ladies, if you will excuse me,
I'll go slip into something more dignified.

49:32.453 --> 49:36.322
Oh, I'm so glad you're back,
both of you.

49:38.292 --> 49:40.529
Does he seem maybe just a little...

49:40.629 --> 49:42.998
- I don't know, off?
- He's fine, Mom.

49:43.098 --> 49:48.203
But you wouldn't notice because
you see him every day, but he seems...

49:48.303 --> 49:50.906
- I don't know, something's going on.
- He has back pain, that's all.

49:51.006 --> 49:53.208
That's what it is.
Is he seeing a doctor?

49:53.308 --> 49:54.444
- Yes.
- Okay.

49:54.544 --> 49:57.877
Just drop it. I'm gonna
get another box of slides.

49:59.213 --> 50:02.117
Woodsey, why are you
so dressed all the time?

50:02.217 --> 50:04.383
Grab a hat, would you?

50:10.392 --> 50:12.291
Flo, pardon.

50:36.184 --> 50:38.319
One line, that's it?

50:38.419 --> 50:41.623
- I had more, they cut it out.
- I don't believe it.

50:41.927 --> 50:43.625
- I'm furious with the studio.
- Good job, Errol.

50:43.725 --> 50:45.995
Yeah, thank you very much, thank you.

50:46.095 --> 50:49.031
You know, they always do it,
they cut the best scenes.

50:49.131 --> 50:51.897
- They cut a lot of my lines, as well.
- Can't you do something about it?

50:51.997 --> 50:55.537
No, no, no. They're a hard-headed lot.

50:55.637 --> 50:58.340
I gave you up for five months
and that's it?

50:58.440 --> 51:01.043
- I had a great time.
- That's not the point, is it?

51:01.143 --> 51:04.680
I don't know, Florence,
I think perhaps happiness is the point.

51:04.780 --> 51:08.584
At the end of the day, more important
than stardom and Hollywood.

51:08.684 --> 51:12.388
Fame is like a religion
in this godless country.

51:12.488 --> 51:15.491
It only provides the public
with idols that they can worship

51:15.591 --> 51:18.994
and then tear down
as the mood strikes them.

51:19.094 --> 51:20.629
Don't change the subject.

51:20.729 --> 51:23.963
She hasn't had a shot, you said you'd
give her a shot, she hasn't had one.

51:29.737 --> 51:32.872
- How's your health?
- Never better.

51:34.075 --> 51:36.680
People say you drink too much.

51:37.780 --> 51:40.082
If you believed all the rumors about me,

51:40.182 --> 51:44.350
I'd think you were... I'd think I was
something quite extraordinary.

51:45.153 --> 51:48.387
I have to say the idea
definitely intrigues me.

51:48.623 --> 51:53.195
- Errol Flynn as Humbert Humbert.
- Yes, it's the part of a lifetime.

51:53.295 --> 51:56.918
I was born to play it really, you know,
I think this chap Nabokov is a genius.

51:57.018 --> 51:58.766
I love that book.

51:58.866 --> 52:00.764
Yes, and I think for the role of Lolita

52:00.864 --> 52:04.670
you'll agree that Beverly
has all the right prerequisites.

52:06.207 --> 52:09.545
- How did her audition for you go?
- Not well.

52:09.745 --> 52:11.847
Oh, you're not gonna find
a better Lolita.

52:11.947 --> 52:15.083
- You can search all you want.
- No dice, Errol.

52:15.183 --> 52:16.849
Besides, she's too old.

52:17.985 --> 52:19.952
That's a shame.

52:21.789 --> 52:23.692
I think you ought to
rethink this, Kubrick,

52:23.792 --> 52:27.126
because you see,
we're sort of a package deal.

52:27.361 --> 52:29.395
You're not serious?

52:31.466 --> 52:33.799
Well, that makes things...

52:34.969 --> 52:36.602
Awkward.

52:48.016 --> 52:52.554
<i>Just when Hollywood closed its doors,
Errol had a terrific idea.</i>

52:52.654 --> 52:56.692
<i>He'd always been fascinated
by the ideology behind rebel causes.</i>

52:56.792 --> 53:00.495
<i>So, he flew to Cuba and began work
on an independent movie</i>

53:00.595 --> 53:03.796
<i>in support of
the rebel chief Fidel Castro.</i>

53:07.035 --> 53:10.369
<i>This time, it was no
bit part for Beverly.</i>

53:21.415 --> 53:25.888
Are all you Americans so bloodthirsty?
This isn't even your war.

53:25.988 --> 53:30.859
I don't even know who those guys Batista
and Castro are. That's your problem.

53:30.959 --> 53:35.064
But the man I'm gonna marry is out there
in that stinking, lousy jungle hiding.

53:35.164 --> 53:38.100
And if he has a reason for it, so can I.

53:38.200 --> 53:41.869
I wish some of the Cubans
felt as strongly as you do.

53:41.969 --> 53:42.667
Cut.

53:44.071 --> 53:46.705
Wonderful, moving on.

53:49.443 --> 53:51.380
- Nice take.
- Oh, thanks.

53:51.480 --> 53:54.183
- I'm serious.
- Goofball.

53:54.283 --> 53:59.020
So we got... three hours
of sun and five scenes.

53:59.279 --> 54:03.255
Here's what I think you should do.
You should do...

54:03.591 --> 54:06.061
- It's nicer over here in Cuba.
- Yeah.

54:06.161 --> 54:09.795
Beverly, I know flirting when I see it,
and that was flirting.

54:10.464 --> 54:14.566
What am I supposed to do, he was
talking to me, I was only talking back.

54:14.969 --> 54:20.576
While you're here, making this movie
with me, you will behave appropriately.

54:20.676 --> 54:23.818
- Got it?
- What are you, my parent?

54:24.345 --> 54:26.812
Don't dare try that with me.

54:31.285 --> 54:33.119
Hello.

54:55.376 --> 54:59.378
- Here you go, Mr. Flynn.
- Thank you, old sport.

54:59.747 --> 55:03.782
- Where's Miss Woodsey today?
- She's...

55:04.285 --> 55:08.320
- Out and about.
- She's very young.

55:10.324 --> 55:11.988
Yes.

55:12.693 --> 55:16.898
I'm far too old for her, but sadly,

55:16.998 --> 55:20.130
she's not too young for me.

55:21.702 --> 55:26.175
Mr. Flynn, there's a place
that's not too far from here,

55:26.275 --> 55:30.877
they have plenty girls,
and very young and very beautiful.

55:32.480 --> 55:34.747
I'm sure they are.

55:35.983 --> 55:38.884
Thanks old boy, not today.

55:40.087 --> 55:41.754
Excuse me.

56:07.581 --> 56:10.569
- Hello.
- Hello.

56:11.118 --> 56:13.085
You're mad at me?

56:13.354 --> 56:16.413
Is there a reason
I should be mad at you?

56:16.513 --> 56:17.414
No.

56:18.392 --> 56:20.559
Then I'm not mad.

56:21.462 --> 56:23.505
You surprise me.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.033
I surprise even myself sometimes.

56:43.417 --> 56:44.987
They are having a ball out there.

56:45.387 --> 56:49.821
And Beverly's career
is taking off in leaps and bounds.

56:50.925 --> 56:52.594
That Errol's a marvel.

56:53.729 --> 56:56.162
Errol Flynn.
They don't make them like that anymore.

56:56.764 --> 57:00.869
Yeah, he's... He's a rascal, that one.

57:00.969 --> 57:03.572
He's always playing pranks.
I mean, it's just so much fun.

57:03.672 --> 57:06.038
To be around him, you know.

57:06.607 --> 57:08.504
I miss him.

57:20.288 --> 57:22.521
You're burning up.

57:40.508 --> 57:44.245
- It's malaria. It's come back.
- I think we should get a doctor.

57:44.580 --> 57:46.412
No, no.

57:47.381 --> 57:50.049
Look, maybe they could
give you something.

57:51.051 --> 57:53.885
Just hold me. Just hold me.

58:00.094 --> 58:02.584
I'm dying, Woodsey.

58:03.364 --> 58:05.197
No, you're not.

58:05.866 --> 58:07.551
I am.

58:08.769 --> 58:10.638
I feel it.

58:10.738 --> 58:13.540
- I feel it.
- You are not.

58:22.950 --> 58:26.220
I am the...

58:26.320 --> 58:29.277
most selfish man in the world.

58:29.377 --> 58:31.385
Don't be silly.

58:32.426 --> 58:35.330
All my life, I've done
what the hell I wanted.

58:35.430 --> 58:38.197
And to hell with the consequences.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.264
I'm dragging you down with me.

58:50.544 --> 58:54.680
- What have I done to you?
- Errol, stop.

58:55.749 --> 58:59.852
This is crazy. Just rest.

59:03.457 --> 59:05.640
You'll be okay.

59:07.561 --> 59:09.543
You'll be okay.

59:41.495 --> 59:42.738
Good morning, Woodsey.

59:44.632 --> 59:46.581
Morning.

59:48.936 --> 59:52.906
Do me a favor, would you, darling?
Bring me that flask.

59:53.006 --> 59:55.216
I think you should drink water.

59:56.544 --> 59:58.678
Water is just for swimming in,
I've told you that.

01:00:02.716 --> 01:00:04.883
Are you gonna be okay?

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:11.223
Yes, I actually think the worst is over.

01:00:11.925 --> 01:00:14.159
For this round.

01:00:14.561 --> 01:00:18.099
- You need to rest for a few days.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:21.236
I want you to get me
a clean sheet of paper.

01:00:21.336 --> 01:00:23.568
I want you to write
something down for me.

01:00:23.668 --> 01:00:25.203
What?

01:00:25.606 --> 01:00:29.041
- Just do it, would you?
- Not until you tell me.

01:00:33.781 --> 01:00:38.486
Just in case anything happens,
I want to make things right with you.

01:00:38.586 --> 01:00:41.389
To make an amendment
to my will, that's all.

01:00:41.489 --> 01:00:44.523
What are you talking about?
You're gonna be fine.

01:00:45.125 --> 01:00:46.731
Just do it.

01:00:55.169 --> 01:00:58.136
- There's some notepaper.
- Good enough.

01:01:04.044 --> 01:01:07.412
I, Errol Thomson Flynn,

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:14.085
being of sound mind and body...

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:20.258
am hereby dictating

01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:25.163
my last will and testament.

01:01:37.044 --> 01:01:41.446
<i>When they came back from Cuba,
it was time to throw a party.</i>

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:47.255
<i>Beverly's 17th birthday was coming up,
so Errol splashed out.</i>

01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:51.368
<i>He hired a band and invited
some of his Hollywood crowd.</i>

01:01:52.192 --> 01:01:54.062
<i>All of Beverly's high school
friends turned up.</i>

01:01:54.162 --> 01:01:58.397
<i>And I think they were amazed to see
what a star she had become.</i>

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:05.504
Go, Daniel.

01:02:12.012 --> 01:02:13.928
Darling, that was beautiful.

01:02:14.614 --> 01:02:16.548
Oh, God.

01:02:27.797 --> 01:02:28.723
Everyone.

01:02:30.297 --> 01:02:33.966
Ladies and gentlemen, friends...

01:02:34.401 --> 01:02:36.271
new friends, old friends,

01:02:36.371 --> 01:02:40.772
I have a formal announcement I'd like
to make concerning our birthday girl.

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:46.314
I want the world to take note
that Miss Beverly Aadland, a lovely girl,

01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:50.716
somewhere between
the ages of five and 50...

01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:56.088
will soon become
the fourth and final Mrs. Flynn.

01:03:01.763 --> 01:03:05.151
<i>Happy birthday, happy, happy birthday</i>

01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:06.798
<i>Happy birthday</i>

01:03:06.898 --> 01:03:08.675
Happy, darling?

01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:13.341
We did it, baby. We did it.

01:03:16.144 --> 01:03:20.815
<i>And I hope
that all your dreams come true</i>

01:03:20.915 --> 01:03:24.452
<i>Happy birthday, happy, happy birthday</i>

01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:26.985
<i>Happy birthday</i>

01:03:27.085 --> 01:03:30.957
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:41.433
- There you are. Enjoy.
- Oh, thank you.

01:03:42.636 --> 01:03:44.870
Congratulations, Florence.

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:47.475
- Oh, Madge, thank you for coming.
- Such a swell night.

01:03:47.575 --> 01:03:49.644
- I had so much fun.
- Oh, good.

01:03:49.744 --> 01:03:51.046
Beverly looks so beautiful.

01:03:51.146 --> 01:03:54.114
I know, she's gonna
make a beautiful bride.

01:03:54.214 --> 01:03:57.652
You never told me. How did she
ever meet Errol in the first place?

01:03:57.752 --> 01:04:00.188
Well, I think it was fate.

01:04:00.397 --> 01:04:02.624
You see, she was passing
for 18 at the studio,

01:04:02.724 --> 01:04:06.394
so I couldn't really tag along.
Mama couldn't just tag along, you know.

01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:09.898
So, I wasn't there when they got together.
But she told me everything.

01:04:10.398 --> 01:04:11.733
- Beverly?
- Oh, are you leaving?

01:04:11.833 --> 01:04:12.834
Yes, yeah.

01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:16.237
She was a virgin and he made
love to her on the first night.

01:04:16.337 --> 01:04:19.074
And he was so crazy for her
that he tore her dress.

01:04:19.374 --> 01:04:23.878
Yes, it was a $75 bolero Paula Lynn.

01:04:23.978 --> 01:04:26.281
Can you imagine, but, you know,
what was she gonna do?

01:04:26.381 --> 01:04:28.649
- It's Errol Flynn.
- My God.

01:04:28.828 --> 01:04:30.348
Baby!

01:04:31.551 --> 01:04:34.956
- You remember Madge from the nail salon.
- What are you doing?

01:04:35.056 --> 01:04:37.726
What do you... Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

01:04:37.826 --> 01:04:41.529
Madge is good people
and she's been following your career.

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:44.866
- It's private.
- Don't you talk to me that way.

01:04:44.966 --> 01:04:46.271
I'll see you ladies later.

01:04:47.735 --> 01:04:49.504
Why do you keep telling everyone?
It's none of their business.

01:04:49.604 --> 01:04:52.440
- I know who I can trust and who I can't.
- No, you don't.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:55.276
Yes, I do and look,
just because you're engaged to Errol,

01:04:55.376 --> 01:04:58.880
doesn't mean that you own him lock,
stock and barrel. He's my friend, too.

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.616
- He's my fiancé, not yours, Mom.
- Obviously.

01:05:01.716 --> 01:05:03.217
So stay out of it.

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:06.387
Just how far do you think you would have
gotten with this thing if it weren't for me?

01:05:06.487 --> 01:05:09.891
- What thing?
- The thing. You and Errol.

01:05:09.991 --> 01:05:13.361
Do you know how much I sacrificed
so that you two could be together?

01:05:13.461 --> 01:05:16.304
- How much I've...
- It has nothing to do with you. Nothing!

01:05:16.404 --> 01:05:20.368
- I lost my home, my marriage. My husband...
- You did it all for yourself.

01:05:20.468 --> 01:05:22.965
- I did it for you!
- Leave us alone.

01:05:23.065 --> 01:05:26.638
You come back here!
Come back here. You...

01:05:27.741 --> 01:05:30.871
What? What are you looking at?

01:05:31.711 --> 01:05:33.714
You too.

01:05:33.814 --> 01:05:35.550
Mind your own business.

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.820
You know, Florence, I was wondering.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.887
I really wanna interview Beverly.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.693
I don't think so.

01:05:45.793 --> 01:05:47.862
Maybe she could shed
some new light on some of the...

01:05:47.962 --> 01:05:53.165
Beverly doesn't know about the book.
And I don't want to involve her in this.

01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:57.505
Well, I'd handle it very gently.

01:05:57.605 --> 01:06:01.340
When the time is right, I will tell her.
Not before then.

01:06:02.342 --> 01:06:03.830
Okay.

01:06:04.112 --> 01:06:06.891
- That's how you feel?
- That's how I feel.

01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:09.657
So,

01:06:10.487 --> 01:06:12.578
where were we?

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:19.324
The final chapter.

01:06:21.094 --> 01:06:25.366
<i>Errol, he wasn't making the kind of money
that he did in his glory days.</i>

01:06:25.466 --> 01:06:29.738
<i>And in order to settle his divorce,
he needed some ready cash.</i>

01:06:29.838 --> 01:06:32.974
<i>So, even though the Zaca
meant the world to him,</i>

01:06:33.074 --> 01:06:35.710
<i>he went up to Vancouver
to sell his yacht.</i>

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:39.577
<i>That shows how much
he loved Bev. Right there.</i>

01:06:40.313 --> 01:06:42.016
I'm already getting enquiries.

01:06:42.116 --> 01:06:44.418
A treasure hunting expedition
in the Caribbean,

01:06:44.518 --> 01:06:47.889
searching for Spanish gold.
Errol Flynn at the helm.

01:06:47.989 --> 01:06:50.381
That's a nice idea, sport, but...

01:06:50.481 --> 01:06:54.115
need a bit of time to think it over.

01:06:54.215 --> 01:06:55.760
Okay.

01:06:56.363 --> 01:06:57.841
Well...

01:06:58.231 --> 01:07:01.669
- We best be going to the airport.
- Fine. I can drive you there myself.

01:07:01.769 --> 01:07:05.304
- Are you sure, sport?
- Are you kidding me? It would be an honor.

01:07:06.006 --> 01:07:07.839
What's the matter?

01:07:08.375 --> 01:07:10.291
My back.

01:07:10.677 --> 01:07:13.281
- Oh, it's killing me.
- I can call a doctor.

01:07:13.381 --> 01:07:16.951
No, no, no. I'll be all right.
I'll be all right. Yeah, it's getting better.

01:07:17.051 --> 01:07:19.254
Yeah. And I've got medicine in my bag.

01:07:19.354 --> 01:07:22.587
I could use a nice stiff drink though,
if you'd be so kind.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:28.196
- It's in my legs.
- I have an old friend who's a doctor.

01:07:28.296 --> 01:07:32.060
- His house is on the way.
- No, no, no. I'll be fine, really.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.633
We need to take him to the doctor's.

01:07:43.209 --> 01:07:46.781
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, doc. It's George. Are you busy?</i>

01:07:46.881 --> 01:07:49.350
<i>I have someone with me
who needs looking at.</i>

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:51.185
- Is it urgent?
- <i>I don't know. It might be.</i>

01:07:51.285 --> 01:07:54.721
<i>And get this, it's Errol Flynn.</i>

01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:59.424
Okay. Bring him straight away.

01:08:00.694 --> 01:08:03.028
You're not gonna believe this.

01:08:12.906 --> 01:08:15.543
- Great to meet you, Errol.
- Pleasure, doctor.

01:08:15.643 --> 01:08:19.013
And this is Beverly Aadland,
my small companion.

01:08:19.113 --> 01:08:21.716
I told Cynthia
not to call anyone, but...

01:08:21.816 --> 01:08:24.294
Shall we go into the den
so I can take a look at you?

01:08:24.394 --> 01:08:26.850
Later, later, old sport.

01:08:29.288 --> 01:08:31.256
Hello, everyone.

01:08:32.759 --> 01:08:36.430
You all remember who John Barrymore was?

01:08:36.831 --> 01:08:39.434
One of the greatest actors
of his generation, right?

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:41.002
- Of course.
- Yeah.

01:08:41.102 --> 01:08:44.587
Well, he just died.

01:08:45.772 --> 01:08:49.911
Been a tremendous friend of mine,
and of the director, Raoul Walsh's.

01:08:50.011 --> 01:08:53.747
And well, while I was out
drowning my sorrow in vodka,

01:08:53.848 --> 01:08:57.752
Raoul hightailed it over
to the mortuary.

01:08:57.852 --> 01:08:59.620
And he's told the mortician that

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.625
Mr. Barrymore's crippled aunt
wanted to view the body.

01:09:04.125 --> 01:09:06.027
He slipped the cat 200 smackers,

01:09:06.127 --> 01:09:09.697
smuggled the corpus delicti
to my very own home,

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:14.165
where they deposited him
in my favorite armchair.

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:18.269
Well, I got back two hours later.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.140
I was drunk.

01:09:21.241 --> 01:09:23.478
Sad drunk.

01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:27.048
I opened the door,
flicked on the lights.

01:09:27.148 --> 01:09:30.010
And staring right at me,

01:09:30.117 --> 01:09:32.121
was John Barrymore.

01:09:33.019 --> 01:09:35.923
His eyes were cold.
His expression was...

01:09:36.023 --> 01:09:40.559
He was bloodless, gray, bloated.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.965
I let out a gasp. I ran out the door.

01:09:44.465 --> 01:09:48.169
I was about to climb into my car and
tear down the hill, when I heard voices.

01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:52.907
There on the porch
was Raoul and his cronies,

01:09:53.006 --> 01:09:55.654
just as pleased as punch.

01:09:57.812 --> 01:09:59.880
What happened to the body, Errol?

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.590
Oh, they took it back to the mortuary
and no one was the wiser.

01:10:04.852 --> 01:10:08.423
But if I know Barrymore,
he was up on his cloud saying,

01:10:08.523 --> 01:10:13.725
"Thanks for the outing, boys.
That last place was a bit cramped."

01:10:17.364 --> 01:10:21.376
Is it true you have a two-way mirror
put up in your guestroom?

01:10:21.869 --> 01:10:25.506
I'm sorry, young man. I would never
corrupt you with that sordid tale.

01:10:25.606 --> 01:10:27.589
Oh, it's all right.
He can hear it, Errol.

01:10:28.242 --> 01:10:31.846
To tell you the truth,
I need to lie down for just a bit.

01:10:31.946 --> 01:10:33.699
- Do you need me to...
- No, no, no.

01:10:35.382 --> 01:10:38.617
Stay there, old sport.
I never felt better in my life.

01:10:40.587 --> 01:10:43.555
I shall return.

01:11:03.409 --> 01:11:07.846
- So, how do you like Vancouver?
- Oh, it's beautiful. We really like it.

01:11:08.515 --> 01:11:11.249
Can I ask how old you are, Beverly?

01:11:11.784 --> 01:11:13.453
I'm 21.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:17.355
Really? You look younger.

01:11:17.691 --> 01:11:21.262
I was only 18, when I met Kenneth
and we were in high school.

01:11:21.362 --> 01:11:24.796
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm going to check on Errol.

01:11:41.347 --> 01:11:43.376
Errol? Errol?

01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:47.554
Errol? Is it your back, Errol?

01:11:47.654 --> 01:11:52.159
Errol? Help! Someone help me! Please!

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:55.296
Errol? Help!

01:11:55.396 --> 01:11:57.854
Help me, someone! Help me!

01:11:57.954 --> 01:12:01.266
Help! Please, help!

01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:04.037
Errol? Errol!

01:12:05.037 --> 01:12:06.651
Errol?

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.047
No.

01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:17.982
No!

01:12:18.518 --> 01:12:20.752
Errol, no!

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.328
But is it true Errol Flynn
died in your arms?

01:12:27.428 --> 01:12:29.830
- What were his last words?
- How long had you known him?

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.132
Are you going to the funeral?

01:12:31.232 --> 01:12:33.607
Miss Aadland, did Flynn
leave you anything in his will?

01:12:35.735 --> 01:12:38.239
- Beverly! Bev!
- Miss Aadland, how did you meet...

01:12:38.339 --> 01:12:39.771
How old are you?

01:12:43.093 --> 01:12:44.275
Beverly!

01:12:56.156 --> 01:13:00.261
<i>Now, it's time for our once-a-week round-up
of America's number one society stories.</i>

01:13:00.361 --> 01:13:01.963
<i>What's the news this week, Hedda?</i>

01:13:02.063 --> 01:13:05.925
<i>Well, I for one, am fed to the teeth
with all the drool</i>

01:13:06.025 --> 01:13:10.505
<i>about Errol Flynn and the Aadland ladies.
It makes me sick.</i>

01:13:10.605 --> 01:13:14.175
<i>We've known for years
what a roué Flynn was.</i>

01:13:14.275 --> 01:13:19.577
<i>And he met his match in Beverly,
a teen hellcat...</i>

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:31.292
<i>As for the peg-legged scheming mother,
well, Mrs. Aadland,</i>

01:13:31.392 --> 01:13:34.128
<i>in this state there is
a little statute on the books</i>

01:13:34.228 --> 01:13:37.165
<i>about contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.</i>

01:13:37.265 --> 01:13:42.967
<i>Keep it up and you'll end up
right where you belong, in the clink.</i>

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:55.855
Bev! Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

01:13:55.955 --> 01:13:58.986
I missed you so much. Come on.

01:13:59.086 --> 01:14:01.989
You look tired. Have you been sleeping?

01:14:02.089 --> 01:14:06.426
I'm fine. I just... just wanted
to stay out of the spotlight.

01:14:06.726 --> 01:14:10.794
I know. It's... It's been very hard.

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:17.070
I fixed up the bedroom
for you very nicely.

01:14:18.105 --> 01:14:19.674
And I'll just... I'll stay on the couch.

01:14:19.774 --> 01:14:23.053
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm fine with the couch.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.778
Mom?

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:32.720
There's all this crazy stuff in the press
about me being pregnant, and the will.

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:35.441
It makes me so damned mad.

01:14:36.155 --> 01:14:39.659
- Have you been talking to them?
- No, not really.

01:14:39.959 --> 01:14:41.445
Well, don't.

01:14:43.863 --> 01:14:47.401
She's not great. She's only been sleeping
about two hours at a time.

01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:50.271
And she doesn't eat...
I didn't know what was wrong.

01:14:50.371 --> 01:14:54.742
So I took her to the doctor and the
doctor said that she's just grief-stricken.

01:14:54.842 --> 01:14:58.746
- <i>Well, she's been through a lot.</i>
- I know, Ronnie. I know.

01:14:58.846 --> 01:15:00.480
That's why I thought
it would be a good idea

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:04.118
for her to just... You know,
throw herself into something.

01:15:04.218 --> 01:15:07.722
Like her career.
Take advantage of all the attention.

01:15:07.822 --> 01:15:11.959
In fact, there's a guy out in Glendale
who wants her to appear in his nightclub.

01:15:12.059 --> 01:15:14.892
It's just the ticket for Bev, I think.

01:15:34.047 --> 01:15:37.318
<i>Some say that happiness</i>

01:15:37.418 --> 01:15:41.489
<i>Is hard to find</i>

01:15:41.589 --> 01:15:44.725
<i>Some say they'd never</i>

01:15:44.825 --> 01:15:47.928
<i>Have peace of mind</i>

01:15:48.028 --> 01:15:51.432
<i>I say the same thing</i>

01:15:51.532 --> 01:15:54.868
<i>And I thought it was true</i>

01:15:54.968 --> 01:15:59.031
<i>But that was before</i>

01:15:59.131 --> 01:16:02.576
<i>I met you</i>

01:16:02.676 --> 01:16:05.813
<i>Some say that life</i>

01:16:05.913 --> 01:16:09.716
<i>Is a mystery</i>

01:16:09.816 --> 01:16:13.055
<i>Some say that love</i>

01:16:13.155 --> 01:16:16.554
- <i>Brings only misery</i>
- Asshole.

01:16:16.654 --> 01:16:20.113
<i>I say the same thing</i>

01:16:20.213 --> 01:16:23.657
<i>And I thought it was true</i>

01:16:23.757 --> 01:16:29.734
<i>But that was before I met you</i>

01:16:30.269 --> 01:16:32.907
Hank Segal of the Times loved you.

01:16:33.007 --> 01:16:35.910
And the Hollywood Post
is gonna write a little article.

01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:40.814
And Pat is so happy because the take
at the bar was twice what it normally is.

01:16:40.914 --> 01:16:43.149
That's 'cause you were here.

01:16:43.449 --> 01:16:46.120
Very funny. So...
What do you say we celebrate

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:49.723
and go, maybe, to Canter's
and get a burger and a shake?

01:16:49.823 --> 01:16:53.090
I can't. I'm going to a party
at Jack's tonight.

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:55.729
I don't like you hanging out
with those punks.

01:16:55.829 --> 01:16:59.099
They are... They just play up to you because
you're famous and because of Errol...

01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:02.667
- That's not true.
- You be home by midnight.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.393
Beverly?

01:17:25.324 --> 01:17:26.893
Bev?

01:17:33.966 --> 01:17:36.000
Wait here.

01:17:41.408 --> 01:17:45.144
- Yeah, who is it?
- <i>I wanna talk to Beverly.</i>

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:47.581
- Who is this?
- I have to talk to Beverly.

01:17:47.681 --> 01:17:50.584
If you don't let me talk to her,
I'm gonna call the police.

01:17:50.684 --> 01:17:53.566
- <i>Sleep it off, lady.</i>
- Wait a minute.

01:18:19.245 --> 01:18:20.878
Beverly?

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:22.597
Beverly?

01:18:26.819 --> 01:18:27.861
Beverly!

01:18:31.157 --> 01:18:32.956
Beverly!

01:18:33.456 --> 01:18:35.495
Beverly, it's your mother!

01:18:35.595 --> 01:18:38.899
- She's out of her mind.
- She's baying at the moon.

01:18:38.999 --> 01:18:41.735
- Beverly!
- Go home, lady!

01:18:41.835 --> 01:18:44.138
- What?
- Go home!

01:18:44.238 --> 01:18:46.285
But I want my daughter here!
Is she up there?

01:18:46.385 --> 01:18:48.242
- Beverly? Send her down!
- I haven't seen her!

01:18:48.342 --> 01:18:51.811
Yes, you have! You liar!
Get me my daughter!

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.280
Bev!

01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:59.186
What? What the fuck
are you doing, you jackass?

01:18:59.286 --> 01:19:01.489
Come down... stop it!

01:19:02.089 --> 01:19:05.025
What are you doing? Beverly!

01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:08.660
I'm gonna get the law after you,
you stupid punks!

01:19:09.863 --> 01:19:11.662
Go home!

01:19:32.618 --> 01:19:35.221
I called as soon as I saw the papers.

01:19:35.621 --> 01:19:39.426
- When's the court date?
- 23rd of next month.

01:19:39.526 --> 01:19:41.895
- It's hard to believe, really.
- I know.

01:19:41.995 --> 01:19:44.908
Contributing to the delinquency
of a minor and then they take Bev

01:19:45.008 --> 01:19:49.103
and they hold her in juvenile hall,
what is the point of that?

01:19:49.503 --> 01:19:51.777
They're just trying to
punish me for what Errol did.

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:58.378
- It'll never stand up in court.
- Why?

01:19:58.478 --> 01:20:03.217
It's got a lot of major difficulties. I mean,
it's in Beverly's handwriting for a start.

01:20:03.317 --> 01:20:04.685
And that really wouldn't be
such a problem,

01:20:04.785 --> 01:20:08.522
except for when you look on the back,
there's no signature page.

01:20:08.722 --> 01:20:12.590
- It's gotta be there, somewhere.
- No, not on this copy.

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:17.565
He dictated it to Beverly,
so he must have signed it.

01:20:17.665 --> 01:20:20.200
I mean, he wanted Beverly
to have a third of his estate.

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.670
Well, his estate is,
believe me, a nightmare.

01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:25.539
I don't really care.
You've gotta find the signature page.

01:20:25.639 --> 01:20:27.808
But Florence, it's more than that.

01:20:27.908 --> 01:20:33.444
He needed to initial every page in the
presence of a witness, two witnesses.

01:20:34.381 --> 01:20:36.814
This is a sloppy job.

01:20:37.449 --> 01:20:38.882
Typical.

01:21:22.261 --> 01:21:25.532
- Are you eating? You look thin.
- No, I'm fine.

01:21:25.732 --> 01:21:30.337
- They taking good care of you?
- Yeah, they're really nice.

01:21:30.537 --> 01:21:34.472
Don't worry, baby. We're gonna
be back together again real soon.

01:21:38.377 --> 01:21:41.548
Mom, people are saying that they're
never gonna give you custody.

01:21:41.748 --> 01:21:44.481
What? Who's saying that?

01:21:44.851 --> 01:21:49.186
Just people around here.
My social worker and stuff.

01:21:49.522 --> 01:21:53.260
Well, that's not true. I've spent my
last dime on a crackerjack attorney

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.129
and I'm fighting
with everything that I've got.

01:21:55.529 --> 01:21:57.294
I know.

01:21:59.698 --> 01:22:02.669
But I just wanted to say
that if it doesn't go your way,

01:22:02.769 --> 01:22:06.406
they've talked to me about some
foster care at a ranch outside the city.

01:22:06.506 --> 01:22:08.208
No, that's not gonna happen.
That's not gonna happen.

01:22:08.308 --> 01:22:11.006
It's not the way it's meant to be.

01:22:12.011 --> 01:22:14.782
I don't think that anything
was ever meant to be, Mom.

01:22:14.982 --> 01:22:17.660
I disagree.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.775
All right, I don't wanna argue about it.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.830
Bev, I...

01:22:33.867 --> 01:22:38.272
I went to see the lawyer
about the will and...

01:22:38.372 --> 01:22:41.539
It's no good.
He doesn't think it's gonna hold up.

01:22:42.808 --> 01:22:46.313
But, Errol dictated it
to me himself in Cuba.

01:22:46.413 --> 01:22:49.617
I know, I know, I know.
But they can't find the signature page.

01:22:49.717 --> 01:22:53.883
And they don't know if it was stolen
or it was misplaced. Then he didn't...

01:22:54.221 --> 01:22:58.394
He didn't file the damn
thing properly. It's just...

01:22:58.992 --> 01:23:01.425
Left us high and dry.

01:23:03.796 --> 01:23:06.063
Well, I don't care.

01:23:08.534 --> 01:23:11.068
I don't care about the money.

01:23:12.438 --> 01:23:15.572
I don't care about anything, really.

01:23:17.244 --> 01:23:19.365
There's nothing that can bring him back.

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:22.246
I know, baby.

01:23:24.351 --> 01:23:27.885
It was a party
whenever he was around, wasn't it?

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:32.723
Now, the party's over
and we have to clean up the mess.

01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:39.933
But, actually, Bev...

01:23:40.033 --> 01:23:42.379
Something has...

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:47.079
come up that might be
a silver lining to all of this.

01:23:48.507 --> 01:23:50.637
There's an offer of a book.

01:23:51.577 --> 01:23:55.148
It would be about you and me and Errol,
and I've been talking to this writer.

01:23:55.248 --> 01:23:58.785
He seems like a good guy
and he says it's a slam dunk.

01:23:58.885 --> 01:24:01.554
- Mom, don't.
- What?

01:24:01.654 --> 01:24:06.305
Don't do that. Don't talk to him.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:10.230
- Bev, did you love Errol?
- Of course.

01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:13.868
Well, don't you think that you owe to him
to tell the real story of your love?

01:24:14.368 --> 01:24:17.804
I mean, all the gutter versions
are out there.

01:24:17.904 --> 01:24:20.841
Now is our chance
to set the record straight,

01:24:20.941 --> 01:24:24.818
to tell the world what a good man
he was and how much he loved you.

01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:30.188
Bev, you're still so young.

01:24:31.083 --> 01:24:36.120
When you get to be my age, you realize
that life just goes by in a minute.

01:24:36.855 --> 01:24:39.593
This is our chance to make our mark.

01:24:39.693 --> 01:24:42.663
All those people that are clucking
their tongues at us,

01:24:42.763 --> 01:24:45.732
they don't have what we have.
They don't have our real story.

01:24:45.832 --> 01:24:49.567
A love story that will stand
the test of time.

01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:54.575
People will know who we are,
a hundred years from now.

01:24:54.875 --> 01:24:58.642
But none of that matters
once you're gone.

01:24:59.612 --> 01:25:00.983
Look at Errol.

01:25:01.083 --> 01:25:05.152
Look at Errol. He is still here,
because he's Robin Hood,

01:25:05.252 --> 01:25:08.255
the swashbuckler, and people remember.

01:25:08.355 --> 01:25:10.854
Have you signed anything with him?

01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:13.212
Not yet.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:16.193
Well, don't.

01:25:16.895 --> 01:25:20.898
- Promise me that you won't.
- Oh, Beverly.

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:27.104
Promise me,
or you'll never see me again.

01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:39.257
All right, I promise.

01:25:39.652 --> 01:25:41.326
Thank you.

01:25:43.422 --> 01:25:45.556
I love you, Mom.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:52.035
I love you, baby.
