Previously on
"Ex on the Beach"...

00:04.037 --> 00:06.039
{\an8}Faith was hit with her
second ex, Marcus,

00:06.106 --> 00:06.973
{\an8}but he pissed everyone off

00:07.040 --> 00:08.808
{\an8}and was kicked
out of the villa

00:08.875 --> 00:10.343
{\an8}before he had time
to unpack.

00:10.410 --> 00:11.611
(bleep) off!

00:11.678 --> 00:13.146
{\an1}Have another shot,
baby girl.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.347
Shut the (bleep) up!

00:14.414 --> 00:17.484
{\an8}Victoria saved her ex, Luis,
from elimination

00:17.550 --> 00:18.685
{\an8}to make up
for her cheating ways.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.553
{\an3}(Romeo)
Crush.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.089
Wow!

00:23.156 --> 00:24.958
Do I still
have to apologize or...

00:25.024 --> 00:26.292
(housemates laughing)

00:26.359 --> 00:29.362
{\an8}Faith gained hope that her
slow burn with June

00:29.429 --> 00:30.663
{\an8}might soon burst into flames.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.531
(chirping)
Okay!

00:32.598 --> 00:33.833
Mmm!

00:33.900 --> 00:37.070
{\an8}And the Shack of Secrets
tore Paulie and Lexi apart.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.104
You didn't have the balls

00:38.171 --> 00:39.672
to come to me as
a (bleep) man

00:39.739 --> 00:42.208
and tell me that--
how you felt about me!

00:42.275 --> 00:45.979
{\an8}Tonight, Faith loses faith
in her future with June.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.881
{\an1}I can never have
a guy just be normal.

00:47.947 --> 00:49.048
{\an1}Like, just be like,
"Yo, like,

00:49.115 --> 00:50.049
"I'm here for you.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.017
I want just you."

00:51.084 --> 00:52.318
{\an1}Like, I'm not
that (bleep) bomb.

00:52.385 --> 00:56.089
{\an8}Will Shanley be the next
victim of Hurricane Angela?

00:56.156 --> 00:57.123
I'm not even getting...

00:57.190 --> 00:59.459
You're in my (bleep)
bed, bitch!

00:59.526 --> 01:02.729
{\an8}Will Alicia's rage
finally piss Cory off

01:02.796 --> 01:04.063
{\an8}or just turn him on?

01:04.129 --> 01:05.131
(Cory)
I'm not gonna lie.

01:05.197 --> 01:05.732
It's turning me on right now.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.333
I'm sick, yes.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.637
{\an8}And what jaw-dropping twist
will rock the villa?

01:10.703 --> 01:12.605

{\an8}Let's get you caught up.

01:31.157 --> 01:32.892
{\an8}Ten singles came into
the villa looking for love

01:32.959 --> 01:36.095
{\an8}but then their exes showed up.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.465
{\an8}With Chase's
ex Skyler out of the villa,

01:38.531 --> 01:40.033
{\an8}Chase finally threw
Victoria a bone

01:40.099 --> 01:42.869
{\an8}and took her
on a cliff-side date.

01:42.936 --> 01:43.870
{\an8}This cute face.

01:45.038 --> 01:47.173
{\an8}She's falling
hard for Chase.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.008
{\an8}So now her ex, Luis,
is pretty much

01:51.077 --> 01:52.412
{\an8}Like Luis, Jasmine hasn't
had any luck

01:52.479 --> 01:56.349
{\an8}getting it in since things
crashed and burned with Derrick

01:56.416 --> 01:59.252
{\an8}after he hooked up with
his ex, Angela.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.354
{\an8}And Lexi still
isn't speaking to Paulie

02:01.421 --> 02:03.389
{\an8}after learning how
shady he was

02:03.456 --> 02:05.758
{\an8}while they were
dating the first time around.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.494
This is never gonna work.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.127
{\an8}All right,
all caught up?

02:09.195 --> 02:10.263
{\an8}I hope so.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.931
{\an8}Because another ex is about

02:11.998 --> 02:14.767

The first time Chelsko came,

Jasmine and I dated
about a month and a half

{\an1}a little insecurity

36:38.262 --> 36:39.430
{\an8}First one is a cut.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.135
{\an8}But you got a crush,
my brother,

36:44.201 --> 36:47.071
{\an8}which means this
cut is cancelled out.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.806
{\an8}You are safe.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.975
{\an8}(Jasmine)
I crushed Marco
and I'm happy about it.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.644
{\an8}Me and Marco, like, we haven't
really had that time

36:53.711 --> 36:54.745
{\an8}to really get
to know, like,

36:54.812 --> 36:57.715
{\an8}if we wanna be more than
just friends.

36:57.782 --> 37:00.651
So, I think it'll be
nice to have time with him.

37:00.718 --> 37:01.352
We'll see what happens.

37:01.419 --> 37:03.287
Derrick,
you're next.

37:05.089 --> 37:06.791
Wow.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.659
You got nothing.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.494
The game's
been changing.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.295
This is crazy.

37:11.362 --> 37:14.298
{\an8}Charles,
you the new guy.

37:14.365 --> 37:15.466
{\an8}Ready for this?

37:15.533 --> 37:16.500
{\an8}All right.

37:17.201 --> 37:18.269
{\an8}I see something.

37:18.336 --> 37:20.071
{\an8}You got a chip.

37:21.772 --> 37:23.441
{\an8}It's not a good one,
it's a cut.

37:25.543 --> 37:27.445
{\an8}We shall see,
my brother.

37:27.511 --> 37:30.648
Now, June, Shanley,
you're in the hot seat.

37:30.715 --> 37:32.683
June, please step up
to your pineapple.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.285
Me, let's go.

37:34.352 --> 37:35.453
We here.

37:37.622 --> 37:39.056
So how you
feeling right now?

37:39.123 --> 37:40.925
Honestly, what I do know
is that if there's

37:40.992 --> 37:42.393
anybody that I can
count on in here...

37:42.460 --> 37:44.495
it's my girl Faith.

37:44.562 --> 37:45.896
I've got faith in Faith
all day.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.264
{\an5}Cool, faith in Faith.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.264
All day.

37:49.300 --> 37:50.434
{\an8}You got some chips
in here too.

37:52.536 --> 37:52.703
{\an8}One cut.

37:52.536 --> 37:52.703
{\an8}Cut.

37:58.509 --> 38:00.945
{\an8}Cut.

37:58.509 --> 38:00.945
{\an8}Two cuts.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.247
{\an8}Still opportunity
if you got a crush.

38:05.549 --> 38:06.450
{\an8}Oh, you don't,
you got a cut.

38:06.517 --> 38:07.551
{\an8}Three cuts.

38:08.853 --> 38:09.854
Take a seat.

38:16.861 --> 38:18.362
Shanley,
please step forward.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.332
Let's get straight
to it.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.204
You got three
chips in there.

38:38.549 --> 38:39.917
♪♪

38:42.319 --> 38:43.387
{\an8}Shanley.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.159
{\an8}You got three
chips in there.

38:49.226 --> 38:52.763
{\an8}There could be three cuts
in my pineapple.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.131
{\an8}The first one
is a cut.

38:59.603 --> 38:59.770
{\an9}Two more.

39:03.541 --> 39:04.108
{\an8}Girl,
take a chill pill.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.911
{\an8}Two crushes.

39:06.977 --> 39:07.778
{\an8}Wow, two crushes.

39:09.714 --> 39:12.416
Which means
you've been cut, June.

39:12.483 --> 39:13.818
Mm-hmm.

39:15.319 --> 39:18.055
You are no longer
an ex on the beach.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.297
(bleeps)...

39:26.363 --> 39:28.032
I'm ready to pack my (bleep)
and get the (bleep)

39:28.099 --> 39:29.800
and spend some time
with June when I leave here.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.102
It makes no sense to me.

39:31.168 --> 39:32.269
{\an8}How y'all looking out for me
when y'all relationships

39:32.336 --> 39:34.839
{\an8}are (bleep)?

39:34.905 --> 39:37.441
{\an8}Y'all relationships
are (bleeps).

39:39.610 --> 39:41.278
Rest up and remember,

39:41.345 --> 39:42.780
I may be seeing some
of y'all at the beach.

39:46.751 --> 39:47.918
(June)
It's not done.

39:47.985 --> 39:48.552
It's not done.

39:48.619 --> 39:50.121
It ain't done.

39:54.658 --> 39:56.060
(Faith)
Listen, I'm really shocked

39:56.127 --> 39:57.495
{\an8}because everybody told me
when I had a meeting

39:57.561 --> 39:59.697
{\an8}with them earlier that they
were not gonna vote for June,

39:59.764 --> 40:01.665
so it's vindictive.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.134
It has to be
vindictive.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.302
Y'all (bleep)
and I know that now.

40:05.369 --> 40:06.504
{\an5}I'll take care
of your girl.

40:05.369 --> 40:06.504
You already know,
you already know.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.939
{\an5}I promise.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.939
Yeah, take care.

40:09.006 --> 40:10.341
{\an8}I think Faith, right now,
she's just lost in this, like,

40:10.407 --> 40:12.376
{\an8}fantasy world with June

40:12.443 --> 40:14.178
{\an8}and she's not seeing
what the house is seeing.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.613
It's like you can't get mad
at the house

40:15.679 --> 40:16.981
for voting against him

40:17.047 --> 40:18.516
when you didn't
even crush him.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.484
{\an1}It must be hard
for Faith.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.319
I saw my man go

40:22.386 --> 40:23.854
{\an1}and I didn't wanna
have to do that to her.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.389
In the long run,

40:25.456 --> 40:27.124
{\an1}you know, I don't think that's
who she's gonna be with.

40:27.191 --> 40:28.425
{\an3}No.

40:28.492 --> 40:29.493
{\an8}I think in the back of Faith's
mind she knows that

40:29.560 --> 40:31.662
{\an8}June isn't good for her,

40:31.729 --> 40:33.063
{\an8}so we were just trying
to help her out.

40:33.130 --> 40:34.398
{\an1}She's gonna
look back on this

40:34.465 --> 40:35.399
{\an1}and she's gonna
thank us.

40:35.466 --> 40:37.234
{\an1}It was
his night to go.

40:40.204 --> 40:42.072
{\an8}♪♪

40:42.139 --> 40:43.374
{\an8}(June)
This is crazy.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.643
{\an8}I'm eliminated, I'm going
out of this house.

40:45.709 --> 40:47.144
{\an8}I'm surprised
that they cut me.

40:47.211 --> 40:48.379
{\an8}They just didn't understand
the type of vibes

40:48.445 --> 40:50.548
{\an8}that me and Faith had.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.316
{\an8}We've actually became
really, really close.

40:52.383 --> 40:55.019
{\an8}It (bleep) sucks.

40:55.085 --> 40:57.087
{\an8}The only thing we can do
is just...

40:57.154 --> 40:58.956
{\an8}deal with it
the best way we can,

40:59.023 --> 41:00.691
{\an8}and I want to give her
the confidence

41:00.758 --> 41:03.694
{\an8}that, hey,
this is not over.

41:03.761 --> 41:05.563
{\an7}(Faith)
Hey, I'm gonna miss you.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.964
{\an8}Golly.

41:07.031 --> 41:10.100
{\an8}I am no longer
an ex on the beach.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.379
{\an8}(narrator)
Next on "Ex on the Beach"...

41:22.446 --> 41:23.781
{\an8}Cory has had it with Alicia.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.249
Oh no.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.750
{\an1}Going around this house,
trying to (bleep) my life up.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.452
{\an4}(Alicia)
Nobody's trying
to (bleep) your life up.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.452
Stop doing that.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.087
{\an8}#shameron has stopped trending.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.655
You sound like
an ass(bleep).

41:31.722 --> 41:33.824
{\an8}And the whole villa
is up in arms.

41:33.891 --> 41:36.293
Every person has (bleep)!

41:36.360 --> 41:37.361
Oh, no, no.
