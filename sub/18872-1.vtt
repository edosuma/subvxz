00:37.852 --> 00:39.788
<i>Look at the way the sun</i>

00:39.888 --> 00:41.222
<i>Makes 'em play</i>

00:41.322 --> 00:44.257
<i>How can you leave them alone?</i>

00:45.460 --> 00:48.730
<i>They're on the sand with B-9 in hand</i>

00:48.830 --> 00:51.866
<i>Caressing the places unknown</i>

00:51.966 --> 00:55.370
<i>Let me tell you I know a place</i>

00:55.470 --> 00:58.837
<i>Gonna put a smile on your face</i>

00:59.841 --> 01:02.877
<i>They got the tan lines on the skin</i>

01:02.977 --> 01:04.779
<i>Watch 'em rub it in</i>

01:04.879 --> 01:06.848
<i>Rub it in</i>

01:06.948 --> 01:09.384
<i>Can you see the hardbodies?</i>

01:09.484 --> 01:10.985
<i>They mean what they say</i>

01:11.085 --> 01:12.921
<i>There ain't nobody</i>

01:13.021 --> 01:15.056
<i>Standing in my way</i>

01:15.156 --> 01:18.860
<i>See the hardbodies do whatever they please</i>

01:18.960 --> 01:22.130
<i>And everybody dropping to their knees</i>

01:22.230 --> 01:25.358
<i>I don't mind</i>

01:30.238 --> 01:34.042
<i>Second to none, breaking out the big guns</i>

01:34.142 --> 01:37.112
<i>Waxed up and ready to roll</i>

01:37.212 --> 01:39.247
<i>As they go by</i>

01:39.347 --> 01:41.583
<i>All the boys wink an eye</i>

01:41.683 --> 01:44.753
<i>Then simply lose all control</i>

01:44.853 --> 01:48.323
<i>Let me tell you I know a place</i>

01:48.423 --> 01:52.260
<i>Gonna make a blind man lead the chase</i>

01:52.360 --> 01:55.764
<i>Close as you can get to perfection</i>

01:55.864 --> 01:59.134
<i>So take a look in their direction</i>

01:59.234 --> 02:02.003
<i>Can you see the hardbodies?</i>

02:02.103 --> 02:03.905
<i>They mean what they say</i>

02:04.005 --> 02:05.306
<i>There ain't nobody</i>

02:05.406 --> 02:07.542
<i>Standing in their way</i>

02:07.642 --> 02:10.779
<i>See the hardbodies do whatever they please</i>

02:10.878 --> 02:14.516
<i>And everybody, get down on your knees</i>

02:14.616 --> 02:19.487
<i>I don't mind, I don't mind</i>

02:19.587 --> 02:22.257
<i>Get the boys together
and we'll stand in line</i>

02:22.357 --> 02:24.659
<i>We like to watch you slide</i>

02:24.759 --> 02:26.361
<i>Baby, you can bet</i>

02:26.461 --> 02:30.098
<i>You and me ain't never seen
the best of it yet</i>

02:30.198 --> 02:32.066
<i>Get a load of this</i>

02:32.166 --> 02:34.369
<i>Get on on over here</i>

02:34.469 --> 02:37.505
<i>Don't get too excited
when the boys all cheer</i>

02:37.605 --> 02:40.938
<i>- For hardbodies, hardbodies
- Hardbodies</i>

02:42.176 --> 02:44.979
<i>Don't get too excited
when the boys all cheer</i>

02:45.079 --> 02:48.606
<i>- For hardbodies, hardbodies
- Hardbodies</i>

02:49.651 --> 02:52.353
<i>Don't get too excited
when the boys all cheer</i>

02:52.453 --> 02:53.922
<i>For hardbodies.</i>

02:58.159 --> 03:00.127
Scotty.

03:11.172 --> 03:13.675
That wasn't too bad.

03:13.775 --> 03:16.878
It was bad, and you know it.

03:16.978 --> 03:20.415
I got a short memory.
How about refreshing it?

03:20.515 --> 03:22.865
Scotty.

03:26.921 --> 03:28.823
- Every day.
- We're not here, man!

03:28.923 --> 03:31.826
Why don't you get that?
I'm going to the bathroom.

03:33.226 --> 03:35.330
Man, perfect timing.

03:35.430 --> 03:39.161
I'm coming. Hold your jets.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.205
Damn!

03:44.305 --> 03:46.007
Hey, what's the story?

03:46.107 --> 03:48.843
You're history here, deadbeat.
That's the story.

03:48.943 --> 03:52.447
Adios. Your eviction notice.
Signed, sealed, delivered in person.

03:52.547 --> 03:55.483
- You're gone.
- What am I, two months behind?

03:55.583 --> 03:58.253
Three months. Today's the first,
numbnuts. Goodbye.

03:58.353 --> 04:01.189
- Hey, but wait...
- Not buts. No waits. You're gone.

04:01.289 --> 04:05.157
- Adios. So long.
- Oh, man.

04:11.299 --> 04:14.269
- So what was that all about?
- Nothing. It's handled.

04:14.369 --> 04:16.303
Okay.

04:16.404 --> 04:18.773
- Well, what's the rush?
- Well, it's after 9:00.

04:18.873 --> 04:21.108
You know my sister... married a worrywart.

04:21.209 --> 04:24.372
You rush off like this,
I'm gonna feel used, you know?

04:25.480 --> 04:28.516
- Scotty!
- Not just a one-night stand, am I?

04:28.616 --> 04:32.253
- No! Three or four nights, okay?
- Okay.

04:32.353 --> 04:34.455
You've heard of eggs Benedict, right?

04:34.555 --> 04:37.217
Wait'll you taste eggs Scotty.

04:38.426 --> 04:40.962
All righty,

04:41.062 --> 04:42.893
special sauce.

04:44.265 --> 04:46.234
That's gross, Scotty.

04:46.334 --> 04:48.268
Do you have any OJ?

04:50.371 --> 04:51.839
Oh, Scotty.

04:51.939 --> 04:54.442
It's a science project.
It's for the landlord.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.778
That is gross.

04:56.878 --> 04:58.903
So how do you like your eggs?

05:01.182 --> 05:03.173
Is over easy okay?

05:12.593 --> 05:14.329
- Rag, I'm hurting, dude.
- What?

05:14.429 --> 05:16.831
- I said I'm hurting, dude.
- Can't hear you, dude.

05:16.931 --> 05:19.033
Turn the music down.

05:20.868 --> 05:23.604
I said I'm broke.
You got that hundred bucks I lent you?

05:23.704 --> 05:25.974
I'm on empty, dude.

05:26.074 --> 05:29.544
- Why? You getting hassled?
- My landlord wants his rent.

05:29.644 --> 05:31.479
I think he keeps his dick in his wallet.

05:31.579 --> 05:34.382
Bummer. Hey, let's run a scam.

05:34.482 --> 05:36.851
No, dude, no scams. I'm sick of scams.

05:36.951 --> 05:39.420
What? The kid?

05:39.520 --> 05:41.856
Stick scammin'
jammin' Scotty Palmer? No way!

05:41.956 --> 05:45.026
No, I hate to cop to it, buddy,
but the thrill is gone.

05:45.126 --> 05:47.428
- Hey, Scotty, Rag!
- Scotty!

05:49.931 --> 05:53.001
All right! Baby!

05:53.101 --> 05:56.237
- So out with it, dude.
- No, dude. No, dude.

05:56.337 --> 05:58.072
How'd it go with Kristi last night?
Come on.

05:58.172 --> 06:02.043
You mean you actually went back
with Scotty to his dump.

06:02.143 --> 06:04.812
I can't believe it.

06:04.912 --> 06:06.414
So what happened?

06:06.514 --> 06:09.584
Ragger, a gentleman does
not discuss these things.

06:09.684 --> 06:12.187
Yeah, but surfers do.

06:12.987 --> 06:14.555
My lips are sealed.

06:14.655 --> 06:17.592
I bet they weren't last night.

06:17.692 --> 06:20.995
What happened last night
was like... oh, man.

06:21.095 --> 06:23.031
I can't even put it
into words. It was like...

06:23.131 --> 06:25.767
Incredible.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.068
...wow.

06:27.168 --> 06:29.303
I felt like I was

06:29.403 --> 06:32.040
going to explode!

06:32.140 --> 06:34.142
Kaboom!

06:34.242 --> 06:36.444
Oh, Scotty!

06:39.213 --> 06:40.680
Mmm, God.

06:42.049 --> 06:43.539
Ooh, you're so...

07:02.236 --> 07:04.072
<i>Hey, wait a minute</i>

07:04.172 --> 07:06.808
<i>Isn't that my Lynette?</i>

07:06.908 --> 07:09.744
<i>With that stiff Leroy in his red Corvette?</i>

07:19.187 --> 07:21.456
Worms, you horny mutt, get over here.

07:21.556 --> 07:23.458
Come on!

07:23.558 --> 07:25.626
Come on, boy.

07:25.726 --> 07:27.995
Come here. Good boy, you little slut.

07:28.095 --> 07:30.765
Good boy.

07:30.865 --> 07:33.163
That's a good boy.

07:41.976 --> 07:44.479
Get off the towel!

07:44.579 --> 07:45.680
Give me my top!

07:45.780 --> 07:48.616
Come on, dog, give it to me.

07:48.716 --> 07:51.319
Dang it.

07:51.419 --> 07:53.788
Good boy. Good boy, Worms.
Good boy, Worms.

07:53.888 --> 07:55.723
Here's your treat. Here's your reward.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.725
Hey, creep,
get your fleabag off the beach.

07:57.825 --> 08:00.495
Yeah, and give me back my top, dog meat.

08:00.595 --> 08:03.131
Sure thing, lover girl.
I'll even help you put it on.

08:03.231 --> 08:05.199
I'll tie the straps.

08:06.601 --> 08:08.936
- Scotty, help!
- Scotty!

08:09.036 --> 08:11.606
Quick, you guys!

08:11.706 --> 08:15.643
Excuse me. You're gonna
have to move on down the beach.

08:15.743 --> 08:18.513
- This area's quarantined.
- Who says so?

08:18.613 --> 08:20.081
I'm Scotty Palmer, pal.
I'm head of the geek patrol.

08:20.181 --> 08:22.917
Now you got a license
to be geeking on this part of the beach?

08:23.017 --> 08:26.254
Look, this is our beach. We live here.

08:26.354 --> 08:29.557
We don't mind sharing with you.
Just don't upset the ladies, okay?

08:29.657 --> 08:32.693
Tell me, dipshit, who's gonna stop me?

08:36.063 --> 08:38.232
My friend Rag here, he's multilingual.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.424
He's flipping you off in 48 languages.

08:48.309 --> 08:50.072
I hope you know karate.

08:53.180 --> 08:55.616
That's one dead mother.

08:55.716 --> 08:58.920
Stop! That thing hurts!

09:00.788 --> 09:03.124
Oh, my God. You guys got balls.

09:03.224 --> 09:05.493
I can't believe you knocked
down the Gonads' bikes.

09:05.593 --> 09:08.563
What, you're saying
the Gonads are assholes?

09:08.663 --> 09:09.964
I can't believe you guys!

09:10.064 --> 09:12.033
Your ass is grass, smiley!

09:12.133 --> 09:13.794
Yeah, my ass is grass, huh?

09:15.903 --> 09:17.461
Come on, let's go!

09:24.245 --> 09:27.646
Later, dudes.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.852
Now have I ever steered you wrong?
I'm telling you.

09:31.952 --> 09:34.755
Kimber has got the hots for you.

09:34.855 --> 09:37.491
He's so gross. No way.

09:37.591 --> 09:41.229
I don't know. I think he's kind of cute.

09:41.329 --> 09:43.264
Come on, buddy. You gotta make your move.

09:43.364 --> 09:46.767
She's stuck up, dude.
She thinks I'm a scuzz.

09:46.867 --> 09:50.004
Forget it. He's a scuzz, Kristi, no way.

09:50.104 --> 09:52.740
You're a hero now, man. You saved her.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.365
Be Scottifitous, buddy.

09:57.011 --> 09:58.412
- Listen, girls...
- He's such a scuzz.

09:58.512 --> 10:00.781
...we got a serious morale problem.

10:00.881 --> 10:04.518
You know, my brave buddy Rag, he's
not feeling very good about himself.

10:04.618 --> 10:08.522
- He's just being realistic, Scott.
- Oh, be realistic, Kimber.

10:08.622 --> 10:10.992
Fuck your friend, okay?

10:12.693 --> 10:14.662
You are so cute!

10:14.762 --> 10:17.253
I love your bod.

10:22.570 --> 10:26.073
Did you see that?
Those two great-looking girls

10:26.173 --> 10:29.277
with that ugly guy?

10:29.377 --> 10:31.679
This could be my kind of beach.

10:31.779 --> 10:34.515
Rounder, did I tell you, man, huh?

10:34.615 --> 10:37.485
Come on, the most beautiful girls
in the world are right here.

10:37.585 --> 10:39.654
When you're right, you're right.
Am I right?

10:39.754 --> 10:42.790
I don't know how I let you
perverts talk me into this.

10:42.890 --> 10:46.294
Ashman, come on,
what kind of attitude is that?

10:46.394 --> 10:48.462
You're not wussing out on us, are you?

10:48.562 --> 10:52.466
No, Hunter, it's just all these nubiles
make me feel like an old fucker.

10:52.566 --> 10:55.736
- You are an old fucker.
- So are you. So am I. So what?

10:55.836 --> 10:59.206
Look, we spent years getting our
businesses to run the way we want 'em

10:59.306 --> 11:01.709
so we could come and do this.
This is the perfect time to do this.

11:01.809 --> 11:05.079
Yeah, well, I've seen more
than one old bull blow out his balls

11:05.179 --> 11:07.014
and his brains at the same time.

11:07.114 --> 11:10.384
That's definitely giving it
your best shot.

11:14.255 --> 11:16.057
Let's go!

11:19.527 --> 11:23.054
Gentlemen, I know you'll love this place.

11:30.571 --> 11:33.908
We call this our divorcee special.

11:34.008 --> 11:36.510
Hey, baby, hey, hey.

11:36.610 --> 11:39.847
Good thing our ex-wives
didn't get here first.

11:39.947 --> 11:42.383
Four bedrooms... one with a waterbed

11:42.483 --> 11:44.018
and three with extra firm mattresses.

11:44.118 --> 11:45.986
That's a real comfort to me,

11:46.086 --> 11:49.223
suffering as I do
from a herniated lower lumbar.

11:49.323 --> 11:50.891
Really? How'd that happen?

11:50.991 --> 11:52.727
What's Ash suffering from?

11:52.827 --> 11:56.786
- A bent wanger.
- Bent wanger? Bummer.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.304
Well, dip my skinny.

12:03.404 --> 12:04.839
Is this great?

12:04.939 --> 12:08.476
I can't wait to see Barnes' and the guys
from the club's faces when they see this.

12:08.576 --> 12:11.946
Hey, Hunter, we agreed, man...

12:12.046 --> 12:15.483
no business cronies.
This thing's strictly for pleasure.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.676
You're right.

12:19.787 --> 12:21.689
- We'll take it.
- Great.

12:21.789 --> 12:23.814
Let's go sign the lease.

12:26.393 --> 12:29.760
Party party party party!

12:31.665 --> 12:33.134
<i>When I'm on the beach</i>

12:33.234 --> 12:36.804
<i>Where I belong, yeah!</i>

12:46.547 --> 12:48.749
Nuh-uh-uh. That one.

12:48.849 --> 12:50.151
With the tongue?

12:50.251 --> 12:52.386
Trust me. That's you.

12:52.486 --> 12:55.823
Okay, floozy patrol
on the beach in a half-hour.

12:55.923 --> 12:57.892
Be there or be square.

12:57.992 --> 13:00.327
I think I'm just gonna hang around here

13:00.427 --> 13:02.296
and kind of straighten things out
a little bit.

13:02.396 --> 13:05.332
Yeah, there's only one thing
I wanna get straightened out.

13:05.432 --> 13:07.992
Come on, Ashman, we're all going.

13:11.472 --> 13:13.841
- Hi.
- Greetings. I saw you guys move in.

13:13.941 --> 13:16.010
I thought you might like a little help.

13:16.110 --> 13:18.012
I don't think so, but thanks.

13:18.112 --> 13:20.147
What about your cars?
You want me to detail them for you?

13:20.247 --> 13:23.184
Chicks around here,
they really like 'em looking good.

13:23.284 --> 13:26.454
Okay, great, go ahead. Detail 'em.

13:26.554 --> 13:28.989
All right.

13:29.089 --> 13:30.558
What's detailed?

13:30.658 --> 13:33.593
I don't know, but chicks love it.

13:44.104 --> 13:46.140
- Hey, great car.
- Really!

13:46.240 --> 13:48.142
It belong to your old man?

13:48.242 --> 13:49.643
You kidding? This is my car.

13:49.743 --> 13:51.545
- You wish. You wish.
- You wish.

13:51.645 --> 13:53.747
No shit. It's my house too, right here.

13:53.847 --> 13:55.249
- Oh, right.
- Really?

13:55.349 --> 13:58.385
And I'm Miss America.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.221
No, I swear to God. I inherited it.

14:00.321 --> 14:01.489
Really?

14:01.589 --> 14:04.492
My folks were anthropologists.
About a year ago they got killed

14:04.592 --> 14:06.093
on a field trip to New Guinea.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.429
- Oh, God, that...
- Really?

14:08.529 --> 14:10.431
They got ambushed by headhunters.

14:10.531 --> 14:12.400
You mean like...

14:13.300 --> 14:15.870
- Yeah.
- Eww!

14:15.970 --> 14:17.872
Yeah, it messed me up
real bad for a while.

14:17.972 --> 14:21.375
Yeah, ever since I haven't been able
to have any kind of sexual relations.

14:21.475 --> 14:23.043
No sex.

14:23.143 --> 14:25.846
Giving head doesn't sound like
very much fun anymore.

14:25.946 --> 14:28.582
Liar!

14:28.682 --> 14:30.551
Well...

14:30.651 --> 14:33.754
maybe we can help you out.

14:33.854 --> 14:36.023
<i>No one ever done me</i>

14:36.123 --> 14:38.459
<i>Done me like she does</i>

14:38.559 --> 14:41.228
<i>I gotta have some of your love</i>

14:41.328 --> 14:42.897
<i>Losin' it...</i>

14:44.397 --> 14:47.357
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.442
I like ringing your bell.

14:55.542 --> 14:56.944
Most guys do.

14:57.044 --> 14:59.035
Right on.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.284
I just rented
the hippest house on the beach.

15:03.384 --> 15:05.519
I got some bitchen cars, too.

15:05.619 --> 15:06.921
You wanna party?

15:07.021 --> 15:08.656
What do you have in mind?

15:08.756 --> 15:10.491
Whatever turns you on...

15:10.591 --> 15:13.894
a little wine, Jacuz-arooski,

15:13.994 --> 15:15.461
sex.

15:17.698 --> 15:20.367
How much are you gonna pay me?

15:20.467 --> 15:22.570
You're kidding.

15:23.170 --> 15:25.161
I don't pay for sex.

15:27.107 --> 15:29.510
And I don't fuck fossils for free.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.145
<i>Ooh, sweet little girl</i>

15:31.245 --> 15:33.647
<i>I can't get enough of you</i>

15:33.747 --> 15:36.617
<i>Ooh, sweet little girl</i>

15:36.717 --> 15:39.286
<i>I can't get enough of you</i>

15:39.386 --> 15:41.989
<i>Mmm! Little girl</i>

15:42.089 --> 15:44.291
<i>I can't get enough</i>

15:44.391 --> 15:47.292
<i>Oh!</i>

15:51.065 --> 15:52.466
Jogging's fun, isn't it?

15:52.566 --> 15:54.591
Especially alone.

15:55.903 --> 15:58.339
I usually jog 10 miles in the morning,

15:58.439 --> 16:00.174
10 at night.

16:00.274 --> 16:02.776
You must be in great shape.

16:02.876 --> 16:06.814
I'm a marathon runner. World class.

16:06.914 --> 16:10.050
You wanna race to the pier?

16:10.150 --> 16:11.652
Okay.

16:11.752 --> 16:13.921
You wanna bet on it?

16:14.021 --> 16:17.191
Sure. What do you wanna bet?

16:17.291 --> 16:20.160
If you beat me, eat me.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.329
<i>Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!</i>

16:22.429 --> 16:25.065
<i>Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!</i>

16:25.165 --> 16:26.834
<i>Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!</i>

16:26.934 --> 16:30.301
<i>Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!</i>

16:32.473 --> 16:34.975
<i>Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!</i>

16:35.075 --> 16:36.977
<i>Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!</i>

16:37.077 --> 16:39.747
<i>Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!</i>

16:39.847 --> 16:43.282
<i>Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!</i>

16:43.382 --> 16:46.186
- You all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

16:46.286 --> 16:50.190
Just trying to give you
a little lead. A little...

16:50.290 --> 16:52.660
<i>East, west, coast to coast</i>

16:52.760 --> 16:55.462
<i>Tearing it up in a weekend bar</i>

16:55.562 --> 16:57.655
<i>Smile for the camera, boy...</i>

17:01.068 --> 17:03.404
Boys, the pond was dry

17:03.504 --> 17:05.873
or I'm using the wrong kind of bait.

17:05.973 --> 17:08.575
Yeah, I landed a tight little blonde.

17:08.675 --> 17:11.045
Had to throw her back. She was jailbait.

17:11.145 --> 17:13.347
Good. No jailbait.

17:13.446 --> 17:15.883
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

17:15.983 --> 17:18.752
- How old was she?
- 15.

17:18.852 --> 17:22.378
15? I have underwear 15 years old.

17:24.223 --> 17:29.789
Hey, wait a minute.
That sounds like my car.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.602
That was so much fun!

17:35.702 --> 17:37.538
Oh, God, we gotta do it again.

17:37.638 --> 17:39.740
Yes, when are we gonna
go up in your plane, huh?

17:39.840 --> 17:42.409
I don't know. Maybe next week.
I should have my Lear jet by then.

17:42.509 --> 17:45.846
That was so much fun. I was so scared
when you were going around.

17:45.946 --> 17:48.716
- Shh.
- When you get a chance,

17:48.816 --> 17:51.151
we'd like to have a word with you, please.

17:51.251 --> 17:53.087
I'll see you guys. I gotta run.

17:53.187 --> 17:55.656
- No, one more ride.
- My neighbor needs some advice.

17:55.756 --> 17:57.725
When Scotty Palmer talks...

17:57.825 --> 18:00.089
- Bullshit walks!
- Okay.

18:02.062 --> 18:05.520
- God, Scotty.
- Bye, Scotty.

18:20.013 --> 18:21.782
Hey, listen, guys, about the car.

18:21.882 --> 18:24.418
I just took it for a little spin
to blow off the water spots.

18:24.518 --> 18:26.086
- Of course.
- And the girls,

18:26.186 --> 18:28.355
they were there
to buff the upholstery, right?

18:28.455 --> 18:31.058
You know that thing is like a magnet

18:31.158 --> 18:32.760
for hardbodies.

18:32.860 --> 18:34.094
Hardbodies?

18:34.194 --> 18:35.662
What's a hardbody?

18:35.762 --> 18:38.365
Hardbodies. You know,
the little foxes down on the beach.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.601
Scotty, you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

18:40.701 --> 18:42.136
Sure, shoot.

18:42.236 --> 18:44.505
How did you manage
to pick up all those girls?

18:44.605 --> 18:46.874
I didn't pick them up. I dialogued them.

18:46.974 --> 18:48.642
Dialogued them?

18:48.742 --> 18:50.644
Yeah, I gave them
a little dose of the old BBD.

18:50.744 --> 18:53.747
- BBD?
- That's not like herpes, is it?

18:53.847 --> 18:57.718
BBD... it's the bigger and better deal.

18:57.818 --> 19:00.254
You guys don't get it, do you?

19:00.354 --> 19:02.689
These chicks are locals.

19:02.789 --> 19:04.691
They want something better out of life.

19:04.791 --> 19:06.660
That's a faster car,

19:06.760 --> 19:08.295
a richer boyfriend.

19:08.395 --> 19:10.364
Hotter action, that's the BBD.

19:10.464 --> 19:11.932
Oh, that's great.

19:12.032 --> 19:15.836
Scotty, could you teach someone like us

19:15.936 --> 19:18.438
to dialogue girls the way you do?

19:18.538 --> 19:21.175
It's easy. Any slob can dialogue a girl.

19:21.275 --> 19:24.044
- Then teach me.
- Look, I'm not a pimp, okay?

19:24.144 --> 19:26.680
Come on, Scotty.
Nobody said you were a pimp.

19:26.780 --> 19:29.316
We don't want you to pimp for us.
All we want you to do is teach us how

19:29.416 --> 19:30.851
to get girls for ourselves.

19:30.951 --> 19:34.421
I don't know, guys. Sounds kind of lame.

19:34.521 --> 19:37.724
Speaking of bigger and better deals,

19:37.824 --> 19:39.927
how would you like to live here

19:40.027 --> 19:42.062
in this house?

19:42.162 --> 19:44.031
It's the best house on the beach.

19:44.131 --> 19:45.799
Drive our cars whenever you want?

19:45.899 --> 19:48.735
Live in luxury, like a king of the beach.

19:48.835 --> 19:51.438
Are you guys fags?

19:51.538 --> 19:53.640
Yeah, I'm the Queen of France,

19:53.740 --> 19:55.909
and these are the D'Angelo sisters.

19:56.009 --> 19:58.412
Come on, Scotty.
We're perfectly straight, man.

19:58.512 --> 20:00.747
That's the problem. We're too straight.

20:00.847 --> 20:03.083
All we're interested in are hardbodies,

20:03.183 --> 20:05.085
and we want you to teach us
how to get them.

20:05.185 --> 20:07.087
To dialogue 'em.

20:07.187 --> 20:08.589
And BBD 'em.

20:08.689 --> 20:11.425
And for that, you get the run
of the house for as long as you like.

20:11.525 --> 20:13.760
I don't know.

20:13.860 --> 20:16.063
It just doesn't sound solid to me.

20:16.163 --> 20:19.132
We might be willing to pay you.

20:19.232 --> 20:23.036
You're making me sound like a pimp again.

20:23.136 --> 20:24.771
How much?

20:24.871 --> 20:28.442
Let's say $500 a month
walking around money.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.344
I think I could walk a lot with $750.

20:30.444 --> 20:32.546
$500 is tops.

20:32.646 --> 20:35.015
I don't know, guys.
It sounds kind of sleazy.

20:35.115 --> 20:36.817
But I'll tell you what...

20:36.917 --> 20:39.886
I will sleep on it
and get back to you tomorrow.

20:41.722 --> 20:43.891
Scotty.

20:43.991 --> 20:45.618
Sweet dreams.

20:56.236 --> 20:58.033
Man.

21:30.804 --> 21:32.829
So long, numbnuts.

21:51.958 --> 21:53.593
Read this.

21:53.693 --> 21:56.129
- Hey!
- You ate.

22:00.634 --> 22:02.602
Hey, guys, I got great news.

22:02.702 --> 22:04.404
I thought about this thing all night.

22:04.504 --> 22:06.606
I decided I'm gonna help you guys out

22:06.706 --> 22:08.408
and for only $600 a month.

22:08.508 --> 22:10.510
$600?

22:10.610 --> 22:12.045
I sensed a strong aura
of need around here,

22:12.145 --> 22:15.205
and what can I say?
I'm a giving type of guy.

22:17.017 --> 22:19.486
- You've got yourself a deal.
- All right.

22:19.586 --> 22:22.453
So when do we start?

22:23.824 --> 22:26.493
We already have.

22:26.593 --> 22:29.118
Get out of here.

22:31.431 --> 22:34.034
Excuse me, little darling.

22:34.134 --> 22:37.270
How'd you like to go suck down
a couple of cold beers?

22:37.370 --> 22:39.840
Piss off, schmuck.

22:42.509 --> 22:43.910
See that, Ash?

22:44.010 --> 22:46.680
No matter how mellow
it comes out, it's still a line.

22:46.780 --> 22:48.682
These chicks are black and blue
from getting hit by lines.

22:48.782 --> 22:51.418
- You gotta give 'em something fresh.
- Like what, buddy?

22:51.518 --> 22:54.855
The dialogue. The whole purpose
is to throw them off-guard.

22:54.955 --> 22:56.890
I think it's time I gave you guys
a little demonstration.

22:56.990 --> 22:59.359
- All right, let's go.
- Okay, come on.

22:59.459 --> 23:01.161
What's the matter, boys?

23:01.261 --> 23:03.627
Don't you find me attractive?

23:15.408 --> 23:17.310
Are you okay?

23:17.410 --> 23:20.313
Yeah, I'm okay. I was just watching
this incredible-looking blonde skate.

23:20.413 --> 23:23.280
I wasn't looking what I... I...

23:30.590 --> 23:33.560
Oh, God, wow.

23:33.660 --> 23:36.730
Oh, you're the good... you're...

23:36.830 --> 23:38.765
I am really embarrassed.

23:38.865 --> 23:41.676
I can't believe I just said all that.
I am really embarrassed.

23:41.777 --> 23:43.567
You were really watching me
when you tripped?

23:43.668 --> 23:47.040
I started watching you
all the way up the beach over there.

23:47.140 --> 23:49.609
You are absolutely beautiful.

23:49.709 --> 23:51.745
You're a model, right?

23:51.845 --> 23:55.782
No, I wanna be, but right now
I'm just waiting tables for a living.

23:55.882 --> 23:58.518
You are waiting tables.

23:58.618 --> 24:02.189
Well, listen, we are having
a party on Saturday night

24:02.289 --> 24:05.859
and practically every modeling agent
in this city is gonna be there.

24:05.959 --> 24:07.961
And I bet you they'd love to meet you.

24:08.061 --> 24:10.764
Really? That sounds great.

24:10.864 --> 24:13.700
- Look, I'm Scotty Palmer.
- I'm Angie.

24:13.800 --> 24:17.804
Listen, the address
is 202 Ocean Way, okay?

24:17.904 --> 24:20.273
These are my friends, by the way.

24:20.373 --> 24:22.275
They're gonna be there.
I'm gonna be there.

24:22.375 --> 24:24.945
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you for being so beautiful.

24:25.045 --> 24:27.206
- See you Saturday.
- Saturday.

24:28.248 --> 24:30.239
Bye, guys. Bye.

24:35.622 --> 24:37.591
- You're up, big buddy.
- Me?

24:37.691 --> 24:39.593
- You.
- What do I do?

24:39.693 --> 24:41.495
- Just go for it.
- Go for it.

24:41.595 --> 24:44.462
- Go for it. Just like I did.
- Like you did.

25:00.046 --> 25:03.783
Rounder, you get an "A" for enthusiasm,
but an "F" for technique.

25:03.883 --> 25:06.786
How about a "J" for jerkoff?

25:06.886 --> 25:09.789
You know what? I think it's time I took
you guys to the ultimate place

25:09.889 --> 25:11.258
for meeting women...

25:11.358 --> 25:13.693
a hidden valley of hardbodies.

25:13.793 --> 25:15.729
And the only thing you need
to know to gain entry

25:15.829 --> 25:17.364
are the secret passwords...

25:17.464 --> 25:19.989
"Let's go shopping."

25:22.002 --> 25:25.605
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Feast your eyes, guys.

25:25.705 --> 25:27.908
They're alone. They're off-guard.

25:28.008 --> 25:31.344
These chicks are ready to be dialogued.

25:31.444 --> 25:34.748
Look at you guys...
dumpy, frumpy and lumpy.

25:34.848 --> 25:37.510
We've gotta do something
about the way you guys look.

25:40.520 --> 25:44.057
Mr. Ashby, you're next.

25:44.157 --> 25:46.993
Hey, son, I'd as soon have
an inch cut off my dick

25:47.093 --> 25:48.662
than get my hair cut here.

25:48.762 --> 25:51.060
Whatever turns you on, Tex.

25:53.533 --> 25:55.569
<i>Somebody's getting you down</i>

25:55.669 --> 25:59.039
<i>Well, you know, it's just how things go</i>

25:59.139 --> 26:02.809
<i>Get up, your Saturday night</i>

26:02.909 --> 26:06.112
<i>Where you'll know
you'll be all right, girl</i>

26:06.212 --> 26:09.749
<i>Well, you don't know
what you're doing without</i>

26:09.849 --> 26:13.182
<i>Well, let me show you
what I'm talking about</i>

26:15.855 --> 26:18.058
<i>I see the boys on the block</i>

26:18.158 --> 26:21.616
<i>And they ask me where you're at, girl</i>

26:22.929 --> 26:25.065
<i>I say you're wasting your time</i>

26:25.165 --> 26:28.535
<i>Better get on up to bat, girl</i>

26:28.635 --> 26:30.503
<i>Well, you don't know</i>

26:30.603 --> 26:32.105
<i>What we're talking about</i>

26:32.205 --> 26:34.007
<i>And I don't know</i>

26:34.107 --> 26:36.507
<i>But we'll figure it out</i>

26:38.078 --> 26:39.746
<i>And I keep wanting to say</i>

26:39.846 --> 26:42.249
<i>Hello hello hello!</i>

26:42.349 --> 26:44.284
<i>Come on and step in my ride</i>

26:44.384 --> 26:47.478
<i>We'll go downtown and dance away</i>

26:49.956 --> 26:52.926
<i>Hello hello hello!</i>

26:53.026 --> 26:54.594
<i>We're gonna make it all right</i>

26:54.694 --> 26:57.720
<i>- Hey, girl, you've got it anyway...</i>
- Break!

27:03.937 --> 27:06.373
<i>He gives you all of his lines</i>

27:06.473 --> 27:09.806
<i>Makes you think he's some big actor</i>

27:11.010 --> 27:13.246
<i>Meanwhile, he's running around</i>

27:13.346 --> 27:15.782
<i>And you know just what he's after</i>

27:15.882 --> 27:18.652
<i>Well, he don't know</i>

27:18.752 --> 27:21.721
<i>What you're really about, let him go</i>

27:21.821 --> 27:24.984
<i>And let him figure it out</i>

27:26.359 --> 27:28.628
<i>Don't waste your time by the phone</i>

27:28.728 --> 27:32.499
<i>Come on, grab your shoes and hat, girl</i>

27:32.599 --> 27:35.735
<i>Go show the boys on the block</i>

27:35.835 --> 27:38.872
<i>Just exactly where you're at, girl</i>

27:38.972 --> 27:42.442
<i>'Cause you don't show
what you're thinking about</i>

27:42.542 --> 27:46.273
<i>Hey, girl, you know
that it's gonna work out</i>

27:47.781 --> 27:50.150
<i>Yeah! And I keep on saying</i>

27:50.250 --> 27:52.686
<i>Hello hello hello!</i>

27:52.786 --> 27:54.854
<i>Come on and step in my ride</i>

27:54.954 --> 27:58.651
<i>We'll go downtown and dance away</i>

28:00.527 --> 28:02.929
<i>Hello hello hello!</i>

28:03.029 --> 28:05.165
<i>We're gonna make it all right</i>

28:05.265 --> 28:09.936
<i>Hey, girl, you've got it anyway</i>

28:10.036 --> 28:13.340
<i>Don't gotta make no obligation</i>

28:13.440 --> 28:15.608
<i>Just gotta get the situation</i>

28:15.708 --> 28:18.978
<i>Get it over and over</i>

28:19.078 --> 28:20.947
<i>And over and over</i>

28:21.047 --> 28:23.550
<i>Hello hello hello!</i>

28:23.650 --> 28:25.719
<i>Come on and step in my ride</i>

28:25.819 --> 28:29.722
<i>We'll go downtown and get away.</i>

28:32.459 --> 28:34.761
All right!

28:34.861 --> 28:36.658
Yes, Lord!

28:44.270 --> 28:47.173
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

28:47.273 --> 28:50.043
- How's the house working out?
- Great. Having a ball.

28:50.143 --> 28:53.380
I bet. How's the hunt
for hardbodies going?

28:53.480 --> 28:56.816
You know, it's the thrill of the chase.
We're not taking it serious or anything.

28:56.916 --> 28:59.652
Big Kahuna to Southern Comfort.

28:59.752 --> 29:01.821
You read me, Southern Comfort? Come on.

29:01.921 --> 29:03.957
Loud and clear, Big Kahuna.

29:04.057 --> 29:06.292
There's a hot little hardbody
heading your way right now.

29:06.392 --> 29:09.129
Why don't you intercept her
and show her no mercy?

29:09.229 --> 29:11.931
Roger, Big Kahuna. Out.

29:12.031 --> 29:14.100
Southern Comfort. Is that your handle?

29:14.200 --> 29:15.468
Yeah.

29:15.568 --> 29:19.305
I'm a little aged, but I go down smooth.

29:19.405 --> 29:22.142
Hey, Lana, watch this.

29:22.242 --> 29:24.077
Neat, huh?

29:24.177 --> 29:27.247
Will you tell Kristi
that I came by to say hello?

29:27.347 --> 29:28.815
Sure thing, Candy.

29:28.915 --> 29:30.850
Thanks. Bye.

29:30.950 --> 29:32.884
Bye.

29:49.802 --> 29:51.538
Is that any way to treat
the men in your lives?

29:51.638 --> 29:53.373
We're only paying you back.

29:53.473 --> 29:55.508
- Paying us back for what?
- Tell him.

29:55.608 --> 29:58.745
We have been hit on over five times today

29:58.845 --> 30:00.947
by your stupid geek squad.

30:01.047 --> 30:03.983
Yeah, Scotty, how's the pimp biz?

30:04.083 --> 30:06.219
Hey, now that is unfair, okay?
That's below the belt.

30:06.319 --> 30:08.221
Really? Word down on the beach is

30:08.321 --> 30:10.590
you've moved in
with a bunch of sex geezers.

30:10.690 --> 30:13.993
They might be old, ugly and horny,
but actually they're very nice guys.

30:14.093 --> 30:15.595
Hard-ups with hard-ons.

30:15.695 --> 30:17.630
There's a lot of that going around.

30:17.730 --> 30:19.132
Listen, I need to talk
to Kristi for a minute.

30:19.232 --> 30:21.434
- We'll be right back.
- I'll wait out here.

30:21.534 --> 30:23.403
I'll keep Kimberly company.

30:23.503 --> 30:25.238
I'm not lonely, Rag.

30:25.338 --> 30:28.074
But I am.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.210
- What's the big deal?
- You'll see.

30:30.310 --> 30:32.145
- Brewski?
- No, thanks.

30:32.245 --> 30:34.047
I'm watching my figure.

30:34.147 --> 30:36.138
Yeah, me too.

30:40.887 --> 30:42.822
This room is all mine.

30:42.922 --> 30:45.492
- Can you stand it?
- Just barely.

30:45.592 --> 30:47.093
What are all those knobs for?

30:47.193 --> 30:48.928
I don't know.

30:49.028 --> 30:50.830
You mean you haven't used them yet?

30:50.930 --> 30:52.420
Nuh-uh.

30:54.167 --> 30:56.294
Let's see. This is the master.

30:57.971 --> 31:00.235
And this.

31:08.047 --> 31:10.083
Whoa!

31:10.183 --> 31:13.186
Ho-ho!

31:13.286 --> 31:15.522
And now for some ocean motion.

31:20.693 --> 31:22.695
Oh, too cool!

31:22.795 --> 31:25.098
Perfect wave right in my own room.

31:25.198 --> 31:27.666
And now for some atmosphere.

31:31.137 --> 31:34.307
Oh, far fucking out.

31:34.407 --> 31:36.242
The best is yet to come.

31:36.342 --> 31:39.312
Slow this thing down a little bit.
I'm starting to get seasick.

31:39.412 --> 31:41.080
Now, Scotty,

31:41.180 --> 31:44.707
get ready for the big bang.

32:03.703 --> 32:06.739
How do you know about all this stuff?

32:06.839 --> 32:09.208
Hey, you've been around. I've been around.

32:09.308 --> 32:11.310
And who with?

32:12.910 --> 32:17.450
- What's so funny?
- My sister.

32:17.550 --> 32:19.586
Yeah, Lana, she rents this place out.

32:19.686 --> 32:22.956
I've been here lots of times.

32:23.056 --> 32:25.558
Is everything turned on now?

32:25.658 --> 32:27.922
Everything is now.

32:45.978 --> 32:49.048
<i>You called your friends
and they're coming on over</i>

32:49.148 --> 32:51.985
<i>The party is on, the party's on!</i>

32:52.085 --> 32:55.421
<i>We might get crazy, but we won't get sober</i>

32:55.521 --> 32:58.691
<i>The party is on, the party's on!</i>

32:58.791 --> 33:01.828
<i>Well, you can bet your life</i>

33:01.928 --> 33:04.130
<i>And you'd better watch your wife</i>

33:04.230 --> 33:08.101
<i>And we'll be feeling all right</i>

33:08.201 --> 33:11.500
<i>Yeah, the party's on tonight</i>

33:13.172 --> 33:16.609
<i>Well, we're gonna party
till the day after, baby</i>

33:16.709 --> 33:19.946
<i>The party is on, the party's on!</i>

33:20.046 --> 33:23.149
<i>The girls I know will drive you crazy</i>

33:23.249 --> 33:26.319
<i>The party is on, the party's on!</i>

33:26.419 --> 33:29.656
<i>Well, you can bet your life</i>

33:29.756 --> 33:31.924
<i>Nobody will be walking right</i>

33:32.024 --> 33:35.828
<i>And we'll be feeling all right</i>

33:35.928 --> 33:40.956
<i>Yeah, the party's on tonight!</i>

33:46.639 --> 33:48.641
- Hi.
- Heart attack.

33:48.741 --> 33:51.344
- Heart attack, my ass.
- With pleasure.

33:51.444 --> 33:54.347
Hey, Rag, got a party about to happen,
dude. Where's the band?

33:54.447 --> 33:56.015
Bad news, dude. They just called.

33:56.115 --> 33:58.351
They're playing a bar mitzvah in Encino.

33:58.451 --> 34:01.352
Well, dude, we need a band.
What are we gonna do?

34:02.955 --> 34:05.758
Wait a second. I got it.

34:05.858 --> 34:07.655
What? Where are you going?

34:13.132 --> 34:16.168
<i>Yeah yeah!</i>

34:16.268 --> 34:18.337
<i>He's got the body</i>

34:18.437 --> 34:20.072
<i>Yeah yeah!</i>

34:20.172 --> 34:23.242
<i>Computer madness</i>

34:23.342 --> 34:24.976
<i>He'll pull the plug</i>

34:25.077 --> 34:27.880
<i>Computer madness</i>

34:27.980 --> 34:30.382
<i>He'll pull the plug</i>

34:30.483 --> 34:32.318
<i>Computer madness</i>

34:32.418 --> 34:34.721
<i>Computer madness</i>

34:34.821 --> 34:36.989
<i>Computer madness</i>

34:37.089 --> 34:39.592
<i>Computer madness.</i>

34:39.692 --> 34:41.994
Hello.

34:42.094 --> 34:44.464
I hope you're not here
to complain about the noise.

34:44.563 --> 34:47.467
No way. You guys, you're awesome.

34:47.567 --> 34:49.135
Thanks.

34:49.235 --> 34:51.304
What record company you guys record for?

34:51.404 --> 34:53.639
We don't have a label.

34:53.739 --> 34:56.243
We can't even get a gig.

34:56.943 --> 34:59.011
Well, you know what, girls?

34:59.111 --> 35:01.247
I got a feeling something's
right around the corner.

35:01.347 --> 35:03.583
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

35:21.934 --> 35:24.237
<i>By the phone</i>

35:24.337 --> 35:26.139
<i>All alone</i>

35:26.239 --> 35:28.174
<i>Will he call?</i>

35:28.274 --> 35:29.942
<i>Or will he stall?</i>

35:30.042 --> 35:32.178
<i>You want some fun?</i>

35:32.278 --> 35:34.547
<i>Another one</i>

35:34.647 --> 35:36.716
<i>String that bait</i>

35:36.816 --> 35:39.085
<i>While you wait</i>

35:39.185 --> 35:42.746
<i>Don't you feel bad about it?</i>

35:43.756 --> 35:46.492
<i>You just can't live without him</i>

35:46.592 --> 35:48.795
<i>Maria</i>

35:48.895 --> 35:50.897
<i>When will you</i>

35:50.997 --> 35:53.132
<i>Be by his side?</i>

35:53.232 --> 35:55.134
<i>By his side?</i>

35:55.234 --> 35:58.838
<i>Maria, when will you</i>

35:58.938 --> 36:03.671
<i>Be satisfied? Be satisfied?</i>

36:08.180 --> 36:11.384
<i>Maria, when will you</i>

36:11.484 --> 36:14.420
<i>Be by his side?</i>

36:14.520 --> 36:16.589
<i>By his side?</i>

36:16.689 --> 36:18.758
<i>Maria</i>

36:18.858 --> 36:23.062
<i>When will you be satisfied?</i>

36:23.162 --> 36:25.064
<i>Be satisfied?</i>

36:25.164 --> 36:27.233
<i>Maria</i>

36:27.333 --> 36:29.368
<i>When will you</i>

36:29.468 --> 36:31.337
<i>Be by his side?</i>

36:31.437 --> 36:33.539
<i>By his side?</i>

36:33.639 --> 36:35.107
<i>Maria...</i>

36:35.207 --> 36:36.902
Thank you.

36:41.814 --> 36:43.749
Thank you. All right.

36:43.849 --> 36:46.118
We'd like to dedicate this next number

36:46.218 --> 36:48.988
to our new manager, Mr. Party himself...

36:49.088 --> 36:51.257
Scotty Palmer!

36:51.357 --> 36:54.427
All right, man, right on!

36:54.527 --> 36:56.262
I didn't know you manage bands.

36:56.362 --> 36:59.065
Stick around, baby.
Surprise is my middle name.

36:59.165 --> 37:01.901
What's the name?

37:02.001 --> 37:04.237
The band, what's the name?

37:04.337 --> 37:05.638
Diaper Rash.

37:05.738 --> 37:09.642
That sucks. Change the name,
call me tomorrow. We'll have lunch.

37:09.742 --> 37:12.378
<i>Be with you</i>

37:12.478 --> 37:14.947
<i>- They want to be with me
- They want to be with you</i>

37:15.047 --> 37:16.916
<i>They want to be with me</i>

37:17.016 --> 37:20.853
<i>- They want to be with you
- They want to be with me...</i>

37:20.953 --> 37:23.155
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

37:23.255 --> 37:24.924
I'm Carlton Ashby.

37:25.024 --> 37:27.426
Cool name. I'm Michelle.

37:27.526 --> 37:30.096
Michelle, what do you do?

37:30.196 --> 37:33.733
Well, that all depends on who I'm with.

37:33.833 --> 37:36.002
No, I mean what kind of work do you do?

37:36.102 --> 37:39.272
I teach aerobics. How about you, Carlton?

37:39.372 --> 37:41.040
Fertilizer's my game.

37:41.140 --> 37:43.242
I own a manure factory in Texas.

37:43.342 --> 37:45.678
- You mean like...
- Cow shit.

37:48.180 --> 37:50.182
100% grade "A"

37:50.282 --> 37:52.018
finger-licking good pasture patties

37:52.118 --> 37:53.686
to sprinkle on your rose bushes.

37:53.786 --> 37:57.290
I love it. Mom always used
to warn me about bullshit artists,

37:57.390 --> 38:00.526
but she never told me how
to handle a cowshit king.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.829
Speaking of good shit...

38:03.929 --> 38:06.165
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, my dress.

38:06.265 --> 38:08.200
It's ruined. It'll never come out.

38:08.300 --> 38:10.736
You know what?
If you soak that right away,

38:10.836 --> 38:13.272
- there's a chance.
- But I'll have to take it off.

38:13.372 --> 38:15.341
- Ricki...
- Nicki.

38:15.441 --> 38:17.843
Nicki, of course.
Look, the bathroom's right over there.

38:17.943 --> 38:19.078
Okay, thanks.

38:19.178 --> 38:21.714
Listen, Nicki, I am really sorry, okay?

38:21.814 --> 38:23.716
I feel like such a klutz.
I can't believe it.

38:23.816 --> 38:26.319
We were talking and someone pushed me.

38:26.419 --> 38:27.753
I don't even know how it happened.

38:27.853 --> 38:30.378
That's okay. You've been really sweet.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.703
Robert E Lee.

38:43.803 --> 38:45.705
Ma'am?

38:45.805 --> 38:47.740
You remind me of Robert E Lee.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.242
I like to nickname my men
before I fuck them.

38:50.342 --> 38:52.678
Just like that?

38:52.778 --> 38:54.880
Whatever became of romance?

38:55.480 --> 39:00.319
Why, Ashby darling,
you want romance? Read a novel.

39:00.419 --> 39:03.122
You want me?

39:03.222 --> 39:05.156
I'm upstairs.

39:22.007 --> 39:24.438
Party time! Ba-ba!

39:26.145 --> 39:29.382
You creep! You totally lied to me.

39:29.482 --> 39:31.617
Hold on a second. Hey, what did I do?

39:31.717 --> 39:33.986
You said there would be
modeling agents here.

39:34.086 --> 39:35.888
Gee, no, you must have got here
right after they left.

39:35.988 --> 39:37.690
Bullshit! That was just a line.

39:37.790 --> 39:40.026
No, it's true, really.
Look, I got an idea.

39:40.126 --> 39:42.028
Why don't we go upstairs
and take some pictures?

39:42.128 --> 39:44.530
Then I could send them to the agents.
They're all my good friends.

39:44.630 --> 39:45.998
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

39:46.098 --> 39:47.767
- Really.
- No, really.

39:47.867 --> 39:49.935
Come on, let's go.

39:50.035 --> 39:52.799
Modeling agents? Scotty.

39:55.207 --> 39:58.444
How about just right over there
by the bed? That'll be good.

39:58.544 --> 40:00.713
I'm not taking my clothes off.

40:00.813 --> 40:02.314
No no no. Just a face shot.

40:02.414 --> 40:04.814
I know what I'm doing.

40:06.352 --> 40:08.120
The lens cap is on.

40:08.220 --> 40:11.849
- Huh?
- The lens cap.

40:18.364 --> 40:20.132
Hey, what's going on in here?

40:20.232 --> 40:21.934
Taking pictures for a modeling agency.

40:22.034 --> 40:23.903
Yeah? Will you take a few of me?

40:24.003 --> 40:25.971
Sure. The more the merrier.

40:29.208 --> 40:32.011
Hey, is this the modeling agency
that's taking pictures?

40:32.111 --> 40:33.946
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I join?

40:34.046 --> 40:36.037
Mm-hmm.

40:48.727 --> 40:50.196
Come on, take some more of me.

40:50.296 --> 40:52.196
- Over here!
- Me!

40:55.267 --> 40:57.703
So how's that photographer doing?

40:57.803 --> 40:59.271
Great. He's already
taken a hundred pictures.

40:59.371 --> 41:02.341
- He hasn't reloaded once.
- Really?

41:02.441 --> 41:03.843
Ooh, great picture.

41:03.943 --> 41:06.712
I've got a great body, too.

41:06.812 --> 41:10.009
That's nothing. My body is better.

41:21.994 --> 41:24.196
<i>Computer madness</i>

41:24.296 --> 41:27.199
<i>Yeah yeah!</i>

41:27.299 --> 41:28.968
<i>He's got the body</i>

41:29.068 --> 41:31.704
<i>Yeah yeah!</i>

41:31.804 --> 41:33.639
<i>Computer madness</i>

41:33.739 --> 41:36.709
<i>He'll pull the plug</i>

41:36.809 --> 41:37.977
<i>Computer madness</i>

41:38.077 --> 41:41.814
<i>He'll pull the plug</i>

41:41.914 --> 41:43.782
<i>Computer madness</i>

41:43.882 --> 41:46.285
<i>Computer madness</i>

41:46.385 --> 41:48.287
<i>Computer madness</i>

41:48.387 --> 41:50.184
<i>Computer madness...</i>

41:53.592 --> 41:56.428
- Hey, Kristi.
- That's disgusting.

41:56.528 --> 41:58.697
I can't believe you could
stand there and watch.

41:58.797 --> 42:00.699
And you really think
it's funny, don't you?

42:00.799 --> 42:04.035
Kristi, nobody's getting hurt.
It's just a yuck.

42:13.445 --> 42:15.881
And what's that? Another yuck?

42:15.981 --> 42:18.050
It must be something
chemical when you turn 30.

42:18.150 --> 42:19.752
Well, I don't think it's funny.

42:19.852 --> 42:23.422
I think all these guys are jerks,
and I don't want to be around them.

42:23.522 --> 42:25.820
Kristi.

42:27.893 --> 42:30.262
Hey, come on, don't go.

42:30.362 --> 42:32.164
I was kind of hoping we were
gonna spend the night together.

42:32.264 --> 42:35.034
Why? So that you could get up afterwards

42:35.134 --> 42:37.903
and do your Tarzan imitation, too?

42:38.003 --> 42:40.096
No, thanks, Scotty.

43:16.675 --> 43:20.406
Ash, Ash!

43:23.058 --> 43:24.683
Oh, God!

43:24.783 --> 43:27.086
- Morning.
- Good morning.

43:27.186 --> 43:28.754
What time is it?

43:28.854 --> 43:30.956
0600.

43:31.056 --> 43:32.524
Oh, 6:00.

43:32.624 --> 43:35.394
Come on, time to rise and shine.

43:35.494 --> 43:38.130
I'm more likely to stoop and puke.

43:38.230 --> 43:40.966
My liver's staging a major coup d'état.

43:41.066 --> 43:44.336
Come on!
It's a perfect day for a marathon.

43:44.436 --> 43:46.472
First we'll make love,

43:46.572 --> 43:49.808
then we'll go for a jog and then we
can come back and make love again

43:49.908 --> 43:52.735
till we bounce off the walls.

44:14.533 --> 44:16.524
Good morning.

44:21.974 --> 44:23.375
What's the matter with Rounder?

44:23.475 --> 44:25.077
He spend the night with Candy last night.

44:25.177 --> 44:26.201
So?

44:28.213 --> 44:31.808
Good morning, fellas.
Get your rocks off last night?

44:34.286 --> 44:36.155
What did she do, bite his wanger off?

44:36.255 --> 44:38.424
No, he's got a case of blue balls...
you know, love nuts.

44:38.524 --> 44:39.889
Get out of here.

44:41.126 --> 44:43.829
Can anyone think of something good

44:43.929 --> 44:46.159
for breakfast?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.902
She's a real space module, buddy.

44:50.002 --> 44:52.171
On the beach, we call her "Candy Wrapper."

44:52.271 --> 44:53.572
Candy Wrapper?

44:53.672 --> 44:55.808
Yeah, she melts in your ear,
not in your hand.

44:55.908 --> 44:58.604
She talks sex nonstop. She won't put out.

45:12.424 --> 45:15.060
Oh! Excuse me, I...

45:30.008 --> 45:32.244
Come on, you wuss!
Let's do five more miles!

45:32.344 --> 45:34.312
Go ahead, I'll catch up with you.

45:36.415 --> 45:39.385
Congratulations.
I see you made your big score.

45:39.485 --> 45:41.186
- Yeah.
- Enjoying yourself?

45:41.286 --> 45:45.057
Yeah, Michelle's a spunky little filly.
Keeps me off my can.

45:45.157 --> 45:47.359
You look a little tired.

45:47.459 --> 45:49.995
Well, you know what they say...

45:50.095 --> 45:52.498
no pain, no gain.

45:52.598 --> 45:54.666
Well, you'd better start pumping
'cause your little filly's

45:54.766 --> 45:56.702
- halfway around the track.
- Oh, God.

45:56.802 --> 45:58.633
- See you around.
- All right.

46:20.759 --> 46:23.061
Come on, come on. Tuck it in, tuck it in.

46:23.161 --> 46:24.797
Tuck it in. Straighten that back now.

46:24.897 --> 46:27.099
Straighten that back.
Looking good, looking good.

46:27.199 --> 46:29.234
Come on, Mickey. What are you, a sissy?

46:29.334 --> 46:31.303
That's only 50 lbs. Push it, girl.

46:31.403 --> 46:32.938
Push it, come on.

46:33.038 --> 46:34.573
Come on. Come on.

46:34.673 --> 46:36.575
Hey, I love ya.

46:36.675 --> 46:38.277
20 more, go gobble some protein.

46:38.377 --> 46:39.845
- Oh! Mr. Manager.
- Rocco.

46:39.945 --> 46:42.481
Hey, I like your girls.
They sound good, they look good.

46:42.581 --> 46:45.250
Tell me, do they screw good?

46:45.350 --> 46:47.486
Now don't tell me...
I like ladies with mystery.

46:47.586 --> 46:49.922
Hey, Rocco, I got a new name for the band.

46:50.022 --> 46:51.824
Yeah, good, 'cause that other name...

46:51.924 --> 46:53.592
"Diarrhea," whatever... made me sick

46:53.692 --> 46:55.327
and I'm not what you'd call
a queasy kind of guy.

46:55.427 --> 46:57.162
Hardbodies.

46:57.262 --> 46:58.697
Hardbodies?

46:58.797 --> 47:02.301
Yeah, it means the perfect
little foxes down on the beach.

47:02.401 --> 47:04.603
Yeah, I... I like it.

47:04.703 --> 47:07.339
Listen, that goes with my concept.

47:07.439 --> 47:10.476
I want to promote your band
and my bodybuilders on one ticket.

47:10.576 --> 47:12.744
- That sounds different.
- Definitely.

47:12.844 --> 47:15.814
Hey, shit, it's a marriage
made in fucking heaven.

47:15.914 --> 47:18.350
Listen, guys are sick of wimpy broads.

47:18.450 --> 47:21.119
Look at these hamstrings,
these gluteus maximus,

47:21.219 --> 47:24.857
the spinal erectus...
this is the body of the '80s.

47:24.957 --> 47:26.458
So what do you say, kid?

47:26.558 --> 47:28.026
We stage an exhibition on the beach,

47:28.126 --> 47:29.684
Hardbody Spectacular?

47:34.466 --> 47:36.668
All right.

47:36.768 --> 47:38.203
- Okay.
- Now, listen,

47:38.303 --> 47:40.506
bring your friends around tonight
and we'll party here, huh?

47:40.606 --> 47:42.674
Beer, wine, booze, pizza... all on Rocco.

47:42.774 --> 47:44.309
Listen, kiddo, I always treat

47:44.409 --> 47:47.479
my business partners right.

47:47.579 --> 47:49.809
May God rest their souls.

47:53.819 --> 47:55.888
Kimberly, which one
do you think I should wear?

47:55.988 --> 47:58.891
The pink one.
Scotty said we should wear our best.

47:58.991 --> 48:01.460
Yeah, well, I really don't think
I feel like going out with Scotty

48:01.560 --> 48:03.061
after what happened at the party.

48:03.161 --> 48:05.064
Yes, you do.

48:05.164 --> 48:07.332
You know you got the hots for him.

48:07.432 --> 48:09.601
I'm the one making the sacrifice.

48:09.701 --> 48:11.603
I have to go out with Rag!

48:11.703 --> 48:14.439
- Oh, Rag, you're so...
- All right!

48:14.539 --> 48:16.041
<i>Do you love me? Do you love me?</i>

48:16.141 --> 48:18.076
<i>Do you love me?
Do you, do you really love me?</i>

48:19.745 --> 48:23.448
<i>Tell me, tell me, tell me
Do you really love me?</i>

48:24.847 --> 48:27.286
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery...</i>

48:27.386 --> 48:29.388
What are you doing?

48:29.488 --> 48:31.189
Why do guys like boobs?

48:31.289 --> 48:33.425
Why do guys like boobs?
I don't know why guys like boobs.

48:33.525 --> 48:35.794
But they sure go crazy trying
to get at 'em though, don't they?

48:35.894 --> 48:37.729
Yeah, but they don't do anything.

48:37.829 --> 48:39.631
They just lie there.

48:42.067 --> 48:44.236
I know why they like 'em.

48:44.336 --> 48:46.371
'Cause they don't have 'em.

48:48.007 --> 48:51.176
Come here, okay, can you imagine Rag

48:51.276 --> 48:54.212
in a set of double-D...

49:02.054 --> 49:03.488
Hey, dude, are you for real?

49:03.588 --> 49:05.223
Fuckin'-A right, girl.

49:05.323 --> 49:06.825
Not too bad for starters, Scotty.

49:06.925 --> 49:08.688
The best is yet to come.

49:10.362 --> 49:13.165
Oh, my God!

49:13.765 --> 49:16.001
Oh, God, you guys.

49:16.101 --> 49:18.296
- Come on, guys, get in.
- This is unbelievable!

49:20.605 --> 49:23.125
Ooh, champagne! What are we drinking to?

49:23.226 --> 49:27.313
Tonight, we drink to the finest things
in life. What are those things?

49:27.713 --> 49:29.448
- Fast cars.
- Fast women.

49:29.548 --> 49:31.917
Fast food.

49:32.017 --> 49:34.019
Rag, the window!

49:34.119 --> 49:35.854
- Oh!
- All right!

49:35.954 --> 49:37.989
Pop that baby open!

49:54.072 --> 49:55.674
<i>Night time's the right time</i>

49:55.774 --> 49:58.242
<i>For making it work on the street</i>

50:01.813 --> 50:03.448
<i>Thrown in the corner</i>

50:03.548 --> 50:05.851
<i>You just don't know who you might meet</i>

50:05.951 --> 50:08.387
<i>Hey</i>

50:08.487 --> 50:10.522
<i>Rocking behind...</i>

50:10.622 --> 50:12.624
Yeah!

50:16.061 --> 50:18.296
<i>For giving up the ride</i>

50:18.396 --> 50:21.388
<i>It's satisfaction, all right</i>

50:22.400 --> 50:24.265
<i>All right...</i>

50:32.377 --> 50:35.180
<i>Came to this place with a smile on my face</i>

50:35.280 --> 50:37.077
<i>And desire</i>

50:39.618 --> 50:42.788
<i>Walk through the door
and then out on the floor</i>

50:42.888 --> 50:44.913
<i>With the fire</i>

50:46.625 --> 50:48.627
<i>Always play it cool, ooh</i>

50:48.727 --> 50:50.195
<i>I'm no fool</i>

50:50.295 --> 50:51.887
<i>But I must confess...</i>

50:52.964 --> 50:55.967
Nice dress. <i>She's got me hot and cold</i>

50:56.067 --> 50:58.270
<i>Now I'm sold</i>

50:58.370 --> 51:00.072
<i>When things look that good</i>

51:00.172 --> 51:02.040
<i>Her name up in lights</i>

51:02.140 --> 51:05.075
<i>She's a woman in motion</i>

51:06.311 --> 51:08.370
<i>Causing commotion</i>

51:10.115 --> 51:12.417
<i>I've got the notion</i>

51:12.517 --> 51:16.388
<i>Huh! She's squeezing an ocean</i>

51:16.488 --> 51:19.691
<i>Let me see a woman in motion</i>

51:19.791 --> 51:21.660
<i>Woman in motion</i>

51:21.760 --> 51:25.863
<i>Causing commotion, causing commotion</i>

51:27.999 --> 51:31.969
<i>- Say what?
- She's a woman in motion</i>

51:36.608 --> 51:38.098
Hey!

51:47.986 --> 51:50.122
Ride 'em, cowboy!

52:02.334 --> 52:05.701
You've got to admit,
they're not such bad guys after all.

52:06.738 --> 52:09.741
But I'd rather be alone with you!

52:10.441 --> 52:13.245
<i>Baby, don't try to talk light</i>

52:13.345 --> 52:15.947
<i>Blame it on these arms that held you tight</i>

52:16.047 --> 52:18.984
<i>Blame it on these hands
that touched your skin</i>

52:19.084 --> 52:21.753
<i>Blame it on the heart that loves to sin</i>

52:21.853 --> 52:23.722
<i>Blame it on this man</i>

52:23.822 --> 52:25.380
<i>I'll take 'em down</i>

52:28.159 --> 52:29.661
<i>Blame it on me</i>

52:29.761 --> 52:33.365
<i>I feel no shame</i>

52:33.465 --> 52:34.933
<i>I did it</i>

52:35.033 --> 52:36.601
<i>And I'm glad</i>

52:36.701 --> 52:39.471
<i>I did it, 'cause I'm a man</i>

52:39.571 --> 52:41.006
<i>I did it</i>

52:41.106 --> 52:42.474
<i>And I'm glad</i>

52:42.574 --> 52:45.338
<i>So don't look at me like I'm so bad...</i>

52:48.645 --> 52:51.817
That's 10 big weenies and cheese...

52:51.917 --> 52:53.852
10 large fries,

52:53.952 --> 52:55.921
10 large colas

52:56.021 --> 52:57.852
and 10 apple turnovers.

52:58.890 --> 53:01.059
- Anything else I can get you?
- Yeah, what's your name?

53:01.159 --> 53:04.663
- Dede.
- We'll have one fresh Dede to go.

53:04.763 --> 53:06.665
I wish. I don't get off till 2:00.

53:06.765 --> 53:08.800
Hey, come on, Dede!

53:08.900 --> 53:10.390
It's now or never!

53:13.939 --> 53:17.670
- All right, Dede!
- Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

53:18.743 --> 53:20.212
<i>I did it, I did it</i>

53:20.312 --> 53:23.348
Head 'em up!

53:23.448 --> 53:25.283
Move 'em out!

53:28.286 --> 53:30.846
<i>I'll take the blame</i>

53:32.324 --> 53:34.025
<i>Blame it on me</i>

53:34.125 --> 53:36.423
<i>I'll feel no shame</i>

53:40.198 --> 53:43.101
<i>She was a young thing</i>

53:43.201 --> 53:46.304
<i>In the prime of her life</i>

53:46.404 --> 53:49.541
<i>Standing there looking</i>

53:49.641 --> 53:52.477
<i>As cute as could be</i>

53:52.577 --> 53:55.647
<i>So I walked on over</i>

53:55.747 --> 53:58.717
<i>And asked her name</i>

53:58.817 --> 54:01.720
<i>I'm still not believing</i>

54:01.820 --> 54:04.756
<i>What she said to me</i>

54:04.856 --> 54:08.693
<i>"I don't fuck fossils for free</i>

54:08.793 --> 54:11.129
<i>Old man</i>

54:11.229 --> 54:15.063
<i>I don't fuck fossils for free</i>

54:16.968 --> 54:19.371
<i>So just go on home</i>

54:19.471 --> 54:22.875
<i>And take matters in hand"...</i>

54:22.975 --> 54:26.902
<i>"'Cause I don't fuck fossils for free."</i>

54:32.183 --> 54:33.852
Oh, Hunter, give me your

54:33.952 --> 54:36.554
big throbbing love bud.

54:36.654 --> 54:40.525
My flower needs watering
from the hydrant in your loins.

54:40.625 --> 54:43.929
Ooh, I'm gonna hydrantize your
flowering bud like you can't believe.

54:44.029 --> 54:49.267
- No! Keep your hands off of me!
- What the hell is the matter with you?

54:49.367 --> 54:51.369
Am I crazy? One minute you beg me for it

54:51.469 --> 54:53.096
and the next minute I can't touch you.

54:54.139 --> 54:56.775
I'm sorry.

54:56.875 --> 54:58.376
I like lots of foreplay.

54:58.476 --> 55:00.578
For how long, a week?

55:02.847 --> 55:04.337
<i>Oh...</i>

55:05.517 --> 55:07.385
I can never get
one of these things undone.

55:07.485 --> 55:09.510
Well, that's because there's
nothing to get undone.

55:14.159 --> 55:16.227
Wait... wait a sec.

55:16.327 --> 55:18.596
I thought you said you were 29,

55:18.696 --> 55:20.298
but how could you have a kid who's 18?

55:20.398 --> 55:23.101
It was, uh, one of those arranged deals.

55:23.201 --> 55:25.170
Gee, I thought I started fast,

55:25.270 --> 55:27.939
but I've never met a guy who got
a girl pregnant at nine.

55:28.039 --> 55:30.098
You must have been an early developer.

55:32.043 --> 55:35.570
God, Rounder, it's so big and scary.

55:37.449 --> 55:39.508
Touch it again, it's been so long.

55:40.585 --> 55:42.354
Kiss me, Hunter.

55:42.454 --> 55:46.220
Thrust your heat-seeking
missile between my lips.

55:51.129 --> 55:54.966
Oh, I'm so sorry! Candy,
I can't believe I did that. I'm so clumsy.

55:55.066 --> 55:56.568
You know what? You know what?

55:56.668 --> 56:00.538
If you take that off right now and soak it,
there's a chance it won't stain.

56:00.638 --> 56:02.936
I have to take it off first.

56:20.658 --> 56:22.494
Whatever happens,

56:22.594 --> 56:25.897
don't stop playing. Deal?

56:25.997 --> 56:27.965
Deal.

56:44.349 --> 56:46.017
Oh, Rounder, I'm climbing the mountain!

56:46.117 --> 56:47.619
Oh! Climb it!

56:55.727 --> 56:57.627
Oh, Rounder!

57:02.634 --> 57:04.969
Get to the top!

57:05.169 --> 57:06.764
Get to the top!

57:25.657 --> 57:28.126
Want some more champagne?

57:28.226 --> 57:30.126
Mm-hmm.

57:32.664 --> 57:34.933
Okay, you stay right here, sexy.
I'll be right back.

57:35.033 --> 57:36.796
Okay.

57:49.581 --> 57:51.683
Help! Get away from me!

57:52.783 --> 57:53.852
Get away!

57:53.952 --> 57:56.154
Someone! Come on!

57:56.254 --> 57:58.756
Let go! Cut it out!

58:02.493 --> 58:04.496
- Come on!
- Would you get out of here?!

58:04.596 --> 58:08.466
Hey, hey! Hunter! That's enough, man!

58:08.566 --> 58:11.136
- Leave her alone!
- What are you doing here?

58:11.236 --> 58:14.005
Hunter, she says no, she means no.

58:14.105 --> 58:16.941
- Scotty, I think I can handle this.
- No, I know you can handle it.

58:17.041 --> 58:20.178
Give me a break, will you, Scotty?
I don't need your advice this time.

58:20.278 --> 58:23.008
I mean it. Leave her alone.

58:25.250 --> 58:26.740
Shit.

58:27.785 --> 58:29.287
That's it, man. That's it! All right?

58:29.387 --> 58:30.855
The deal's off!

58:30.955 --> 58:32.582
If that's the way you want it.

58:34.259 --> 58:36.591
You've got till noon to get
your stuff out, all right?

58:47.138 --> 58:50.596
He, uh... he tricked me
into taking my clothes off.

58:51.676 --> 58:54.913
Candy, why do you
keep on talking dirty to guys?

58:55.013 --> 58:57.379
- Huh?
- It gets their attention.

58:58.716 --> 59:00.650
Yeah, and don't you see what it does?

59:01.953 --> 59:04.183
You talk dirty to 'em, they get turned on,

59:05.256 --> 59:07.190
then all they want to do is fuck you.

59:08.359 --> 59:10.554
I just want them to like me, Scotty.

59:11.696 --> 59:13.631
What?

59:13.731 --> 59:15.400
Hi.

59:15.500 --> 59:17.101
Oh, hi, Hunter.

59:17.201 --> 59:18.937
- You look lonesome.
- Not really,

59:19.037 --> 59:21.372
Scotty's coming right back.

59:21.472 --> 59:24.209
Um, I don't think so.

59:24.309 --> 59:26.411
As a matter of fact,

59:26.511 --> 59:29.447
he sent me up here to keep you company.

59:29.547 --> 59:31.950
Buy you a drink?

59:32.050 --> 59:33.785
What's that supposed to mean?

59:33.885 --> 59:37.048
It means that he's indisposed.

59:38.189 --> 59:40.091
Indisposed?

59:40.191 --> 59:42.627
Yeah. I guess, uh...

59:42.727 --> 59:44.462
he figured, you know, what the hell?

59:44.562 --> 59:48.800
- Tit for tat.
- My tits for whose tat?

59:48.900 --> 59:50.205
Candy's.

59:52.737 --> 59:56.264
- You're kidding.
- He's taking a crack at her right now.

59:57.742 --> 01:00:00.111
I don't believe you.

01:00:00.211 --> 01:00:02.547
Well, go ahead and see for yourself.

01:00:02.647 --> 01:00:04.376
They're right down there.

01:00:05.883 --> 01:00:09.114
You don't know what it's like
when people call you names like...

01:00:10.288 --> 01:00:12.123
airhead,

01:00:12.223 --> 01:00:13.758
dingaling,

01:00:13.858 --> 01:00:15.693
yo-yo, bimbo.

01:00:15.793 --> 01:00:17.761
There's no way you can know that, Scotty.

01:00:20.264 --> 01:00:22.232
Come here, baby.

01:00:23.668 --> 01:00:25.533
It's okay, baby.

01:00:34.045 --> 01:00:36.214
Ragger, I got no idea what ticks her off.

01:00:36.314 --> 01:00:38.283
She's acting weird to me all the way home,

01:00:38.383 --> 01:00:40.785
she runs out of the car,
she slams the door right...

01:00:40.885 --> 01:00:43.688
Hello? Uh, yes, please.

01:00:43.788 --> 01:00:47.025
Uh, one dozen long-stemmed red roses

01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:48.660
to Kristi Kelly.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.829
Uh, just put "Love, Scotty" on the card.

01:00:51.929 --> 01:00:54.198
Thank you.

01:00:54.298 --> 01:00:57.101
It's 11:25.

01:00:57.201 --> 01:00:59.431
You've got 35 minutes
to get your stuff out.

01:01:02.407 --> 01:01:03.931
You know something, Hunter?

01:01:05.443 --> 01:01:07.578
You're really a freak of evolution.

01:01:07.678 --> 01:01:11.249
You got no balls,
but you're such a big prick.

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:13.384
Rag, let's get the fuck out of here,

01:01:13.484 --> 01:01:16.120
- now.
- This is totally bogus.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.279
A bunch of lame farts anyway.

01:01:32.837 --> 01:01:35.740
Oh, those are beautiful. Thank you.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.967
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

01:01:58.863 --> 01:02:00.398
<i>Do you love me? Do you love me?</i>

01:02:00.498 --> 01:02:03.901
<i>Do you love me?
Do you, do you really love me?</i>

01:02:04.001 --> 01:02:05.670
<i>Tell me, tell me, tell me</i>

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:07.465
<i>If you really love me</i>

01:02:09.006 --> 01:02:11.167
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery</i>

01:02:13.878 --> 01:02:16.073
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery</i>

01:02:17.114 --> 01:02:20.641
<i>I said do you love me, Mr. Cool Mystery?</i>

01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:24.956
<i>Don't give me that silent treatment...</i>

01:02:25.056 --> 01:02:27.325
Wow, Kimber Kong.

01:02:27.425 --> 01:02:28.826
I talked to Kristi.

01:02:28.926 --> 01:02:30.862
And?

01:02:30.962 --> 01:02:33.231
She said she'll meet you here
in 20 minutes.

01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:34.766
That's perfect. Great.

01:02:34.866 --> 01:02:36.567
- Wait a minute, buddy.
- Huh?

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:39.761
She said if you make a scene,
she's gonna split.

01:02:40.905 --> 01:02:42.540
Wait, hold on. Hey, Kimber, come on!

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.776
What I do, miss a date or something?
What, I got brain damage?

01:02:44.876 --> 01:02:46.310
You said it, I didn't.

01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:48.146
Kimber, come on, this is Scotty, remember?

01:02:48.246 --> 01:02:51.015
Come on, tell me.
Why is Kristi so pissed off at me?

01:02:51.115 --> 01:02:53.418
You're busted, buddy.

01:02:53.518 --> 01:02:55.520
She saw you on the beach last night

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.588
making your moves on Candy.

01:02:57.688 --> 01:02:59.123
- What?!
- Yeah.

01:02:59.223 --> 01:03:00.747
Hey, Kimberly, check this one out.

01:03:02.326 --> 01:03:03.795
- Oh! Fuck!
- Aw.

01:03:03.895 --> 01:03:06.728
Great! A dumbbell with a dumbbell.

01:03:11.602 --> 01:03:13.805
<i>Don't call and say you need him</i>

01:03:13.905 --> 01:03:17.608
<i>And then not show up
'cause you're leaving...</i>

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:19.677
Scotty, my man, what's going?

01:03:19.777 --> 01:03:22.113
These girls are too fucking much!
Out of fucking sight!

01:03:22.213 --> 01:03:24.982
- Hot fucking shit!
- I couldn't have said it better.

01:03:25.082 --> 01:03:26.584
I couldn't have said it better.

01:03:26.684 --> 01:03:28.879
I gotta go backstage
and pump up one of the girls.

01:03:30.922 --> 01:03:32.657
<i>Do you love me? Do you love me?</i>

01:03:32.757 --> 01:03:35.850
<i>Do you love me?
Do you, do you really love me?</i>

01:03:37.828 --> 01:03:40.331
<i>Do you really love me?</i>

01:03:40.431 --> 01:03:43.434
Hey, get those bimbos off the stage!

01:03:43.534 --> 01:03:46.404
- Yeah, get off, bimbos!
- Yeah, what are you doing?

01:03:46.504 --> 01:03:48.539
Suck shit!

01:03:48.639 --> 01:03:51.442
Jerkoff, you turn that blaster off now!

01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:54.678
What did you say, dickhead?
You want me to turn it up?

01:03:57.047 --> 01:04:00.540
Hey, you son of a bitch!
I'll rip your fuckin' head off!

01:04:01.752 --> 01:04:04.121
<i>I'm not sure, 'cause you're leaving me...</i>

01:04:07.291 --> 01:04:08.883
Get him!

01:04:15.032 --> 01:04:18.126
<i>'Cause it's my heart that you're holding</i>

01:04:20.371 --> 01:04:22.006
<i>Do you love me? Do you love me?</i>

01:04:22.106 --> 01:04:24.370
<i>Do you love me?
Do you, do you really love me?</i>

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:27.345
<i>Tell me, tell me, tell me</i>

01:04:27.445 --> 01:04:30.848
<i>If you really love me</i>

01:04:30.948 --> 01:04:33.246
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery</i>

01:04:35.453 --> 01:04:38.656
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery</i>

01:04:38.756 --> 01:04:40.358
<i>I said do you love me</i>

01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:42.790
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery?</i>

01:04:52.169 --> 01:04:53.971
<i>Don't say you're sorry, please</i>

01:04:54.071 --> 01:04:56.073
<i>'Cause you're dragging me down</i>

01:04:56.173 --> 01:04:59.006
<i>On your knees</i>

01:05:01.846 --> 01:05:05.850
<i>I don't know what is left anyway</i>

01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:08.419
<i>Whoa, Mr. Cool Mystery</i>

01:05:08.519 --> 01:05:11.317
<i>Is this a dream or is it real?</i>

01:05:32.743 --> 01:05:35.837
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery</i>

01:05:37.548 --> 01:05:40.785
<i>Yeah, Mr. Cool Mystery</i>

01:05:40.885 --> 01:05:43.020
<i>Do you love me? Do ya?</i>

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.423
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery</i>

01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:48.192
<i>Do ya? Do you want me,</i>

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:49.919
<i>Mr. Cool Mystery?</i>

01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:54.364
<i>Do you love me, Mr. Cool</i>

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.269
<i>Mystery?</i>

01:06:01.072 --> 01:06:02.506
Oh, dude.

01:06:02.606 --> 01:06:04.075
Where you been?

01:06:04.175 --> 01:06:06.837
You stood Kristi up.

01:06:07.878 --> 01:06:09.947
- Was she pissed?
- Nah.

01:06:10.047 --> 01:06:14.484
She said there's no point in being
pissed at somebody she don't care about.

01:06:14.584 --> 01:06:16.420
I hit an all-time low, dude.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.724
No, you didn't. Kristi went to Hunter's.

01:06:19.824 --> 01:06:21.492
Hunter's?

01:06:21.592 --> 01:06:24.829
Yeah, she said he's got a lot more class
than amateur boy like you.

01:06:24.929 --> 01:06:27.523
Oh, man. That wuss.

01:06:29.266 --> 01:06:31.632
That wuss! Oh, man.

01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:45.612
Come on.

01:06:46.917 --> 01:06:50.821
Kristi, broken hearts come
with the territory.

01:06:51.406 --> 01:06:53.266
That's love.

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:57.662
- In fact, that's life.
- I don't always want to be

01:06:57.762 --> 01:07:00.297
worrying about Scotty.

01:07:00.397 --> 01:07:01.832
I mean, you know, there's other things

01:07:01.932 --> 01:07:04.435
- that I'd like to do with my life.
- It's the same thing in business.

01:07:04.535 --> 01:07:08.072
You get fucked over all the time
until you're successful. Even then.

01:07:08.172 --> 01:07:10.574
You want to be a designer?
That's a "fuck you" business

01:07:10.674 --> 01:07:13.844
with a capital "fuck you."
You'd better get used to it.

01:07:13.944 --> 01:07:16.047
Here he comes.

01:07:16.147 --> 01:07:18.149
You know, I never imagined it
to be like that.

01:07:18.249 --> 01:07:20.484
Sure, are you kidding? They're animals.

01:07:20.584 --> 01:07:24.188
They lay awake at night thinking up
new ways to fuck you.

01:07:24.288 --> 01:07:28.693
You won't even know the names of half
the people that'll line up to do it to you.

01:07:28.793 --> 01:07:30.327
You really think I get screwed that much?

01:07:30.427 --> 01:07:32.530
Mm-hmm. Up the wazoo...

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:34.598
by every Tom, Dick and Harry.

01:07:34.698 --> 01:07:37.668
But if it's really what you want...

01:07:37.768 --> 01:07:41.839
Well, I think that's
all that'll satisfy me right now.

01:07:41.939 --> 01:07:45.076
Dude, she's slipping fast.

01:07:45.176 --> 01:07:48.813
Then go for it.
You look like you could use a refill.

01:07:48.913 --> 01:07:50.938
- Pinot?
- Yeah, thanks, that'd be great.

01:07:56.687 --> 01:07:58.122
- Kristi.
- Scotty.

01:07:58.222 --> 01:08:01.625
I want to talk to you, Kristi...
alone, for only two minutes.

01:08:01.725 --> 01:08:06.097
Two minutes? I waited
for you for two hours this afternoon.

01:08:06.197 --> 01:08:08.132
I can explain about that.

01:08:08.232 --> 01:08:11.235
Oh, I bet you can.
You've got a way with words.

01:08:11.335 --> 01:08:14.105
- It's called lying.
- And what are you doing, huh?

01:08:14.205 --> 01:08:16.207
Auditioning for Hunter's orgy gang?

01:08:16.307 --> 01:08:19.844
Now where do you get off
talking to me like that?

01:08:19.944 --> 01:08:22.779
- Kristi!
- Scotty.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.415
Social climbing I see.

01:08:24.515 --> 01:08:27.151
How about a drink before you go?

01:08:29.653 --> 01:08:31.348
Sorry you couldn't stay longer!

01:08:56.247 --> 01:08:58.682
Jealousy's some weird shit.
Right now I feel like

01:08:58.782 --> 01:09:00.785
carving my initials in Hunter's back.

01:09:00.885 --> 01:09:03.654
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I once caught my old lady

01:09:03.754 --> 01:09:06.157
giving a hummer to some cowboy.

01:09:06.256 --> 01:09:09.560
I laid a serious hurting on his ass.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.328
What'd you do to her?

01:09:11.428 --> 01:09:14.764
I really punished her... I married her.

01:09:15.299 --> 01:09:17.267
I hate him.

01:09:19.203 --> 01:09:22.339
Hunter... he's a creep.

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:25.142
Not Hunter, Scotty.

01:09:25.242 --> 01:09:27.678
- What about Scotty?
- He just makes me

01:09:27.778 --> 01:09:30.447
so mad sometimes!

01:09:30.546 --> 01:09:32.683
I don't know. All my scams are backfiring,

01:09:32.783 --> 01:09:35.685
blowing up in my face. I'm sick of this.

01:09:35.786 --> 01:09:37.787
Yeah, I know what you mean, son.

01:09:37.888 --> 01:09:40.524
A man gets tired
of peeing on his own shoes.

01:09:40.624 --> 01:09:43.460
I start missing him.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.363
And I miss his cute little smile.

01:09:46.462 --> 01:09:48.232
He's not a creep.

01:09:48.332 --> 01:09:51.495
The way he looks at me
and the way he touches me.

01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:55.529
Kristi, I think you have
a serious problem.

01:09:56.907 --> 01:09:58.342
What?

01:09:58.442 --> 01:10:01.278
Little sister, you're in love.

01:10:14.959 --> 01:10:16.560
Whoo! Yeah!

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.495
- Scotty, how's it going?
- Hey, what's happening?

01:10:18.595 --> 01:10:20.364
Hey, listen you guys.

01:10:20.464 --> 01:10:23.734
I want to make this fast,
I want to be honest.

01:10:23.834 --> 01:10:25.436
I'm no band manager.

01:10:25.536 --> 01:10:27.504
Come on, Scotty, you're a great one!

01:10:27.604 --> 01:10:30.241
Scotty, where you been? I was beginning
to think you was a flake.

01:10:30.341 --> 01:10:32.209
I need your John Hancock on these papers.

01:10:32.309 --> 01:10:34.178
What papers?

01:10:34.278 --> 01:10:36.914
Rocco got us a gig...
opening act at the Forum.

01:10:37.014 --> 01:10:38.916
For the Miss Muscles contest!

01:10:39.016 --> 01:10:40.351
Yeah! Whoo!

01:10:40.451 --> 01:10:42.519
- Oh, man.
- Can I tell him the rest of the news?

01:10:42.619 --> 01:10:44.355
- Uh-huh.
- Rocco's putting up some money

01:10:44.455 --> 01:10:46.190
- and we're gonna record a demo.
- What can I tell ya?

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:49.260
I'm the tooth fairy of rock 'n' roll.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.362
Plus we got a show tonight
at your place, Ash.

01:10:51.462 --> 01:10:53.397
- Party!
- Party!

01:10:56.066 --> 01:10:59.627
Farns, bring anybody you think
might be a possible investor.

01:11:00.804 --> 01:11:03.240
Yeah, there'll be plenty of girls.

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.409
All right. I'll see you at 8:00 sharp.

01:11:05.509 --> 01:11:09.579
Hey, Farns, don't forget to take your
wheat germ. You're gonna need it.

01:11:10.981 --> 01:11:12.883
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

01:11:12.983 --> 01:11:14.685
I thought we had an agreement...

01:11:14.785 --> 01:11:16.253
no guys from the club.

01:11:16.353 --> 01:11:19.323
Oh, come on, Ash. Lighten up, man.

01:11:19.423 --> 01:11:21.025
We've got girls coming out of our ears.

01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:22.893
You're missing the point.

01:11:22.993 --> 01:11:24.795
This is supposed to have been for fun.

01:11:24.895 --> 01:11:27.331
Now you're bringing business into it.

01:11:27.431 --> 01:11:28.899
Well, so what?

01:11:28.999 --> 01:11:30.434
Hey, Ash, how are you doing?

01:11:30.534 --> 01:11:32.002
Just fine, Rounder.

01:11:32.102 --> 01:11:35.172
And one more thing, I don't like
what you're trying to pull with Kristi.

01:11:35.272 --> 01:11:37.207
Hey, I haven't touched her.

01:11:37.307 --> 01:11:38.876
What, you're playing it cool, huh?

01:11:38.976 --> 01:11:41.345
I spill no wine before it's time.

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.415
You're a sick man.

01:11:44.515 --> 01:11:46.283
That's not funny.

01:11:46.383 --> 01:11:48.619
She and Scotty,
they got a real thing going on.

01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:50.321
Now you're trying to fuck it up.

01:11:50.421 --> 01:11:52.089
What are you, her den mother?

01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:53.724
She's old enough to make up her own mind.

01:11:53.824 --> 01:11:55.693
Not when she doesn't have all the facts.

01:11:55.793 --> 01:11:57.361
What are you talking about? What facts?

01:11:57.461 --> 01:11:59.863
- The fact that you're an asshole.
- I'm an asshole?!

01:11:59.963 --> 01:12:01.865
- Yeah, you're an asshole!
- I'm an asshole?!

01:12:01.965 --> 01:12:03.834
- You're an asshole!
- You're an asshole!

01:12:03.934 --> 01:12:06.960
You guys want to see an asshole?
I'll show you an asshole!

01:12:09.139 --> 01:12:10.607
Come on, guys. Lighten up.

01:12:10.707 --> 01:12:12.876
We've got a party to get ready for here.

01:12:12.976 --> 01:12:15.240
Not me, I'm out of this scene.

01:12:22.286 --> 01:12:23.887
Old Hunter's using this party tonight

01:12:23.987 --> 01:12:25.614
to profiteer.

01:12:27.224 --> 01:12:29.920
Ain't much I can do about
except just not be a part of it.

01:12:31.028 --> 01:12:33.731
Well, partner, just might be
something old Rag and me here

01:12:33.831 --> 01:12:35.466
can do about it.

01:12:35.566 --> 01:12:38.467
Yeah, I think we can think
of something cool.

01:12:54.685 --> 01:12:56.320
<i>You told me</i>

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.355
<i>You sold me</i>

01:12:58.455 --> 01:13:00.391
<i>Controlled me</i>

01:13:00.491 --> 01:13:02.659
<i>And I believed you when you pleaded</i>

01:13:02.759 --> 01:13:06.196
<i>And you said that I would be good</i>

01:13:06.296 --> 01:13:08.662
<i>Well, fuck you</i>

01:13:10.033 --> 01:13:11.735
<i>You bought me</i>

01:13:11.835 --> 01:13:13.704
<i>You taught me...</i>

01:13:13.804 --> 01:13:16.540
Kristi, let's get out of here.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.842
Come on, let's just hang around
another hour, okay?

01:13:18.942 --> 01:13:20.844
Besides, I promised Hunter we'd stay.

01:13:20.944 --> 01:13:23.447
An hour? There's gonna
be nothing left of us

01:13:23.547 --> 01:13:25.549
except a pile of white bones.

01:13:25.649 --> 01:13:28.385
Un-fucking-believable.

01:13:28.485 --> 01:13:31.522
Makes those bimbos in Vegas
look like corn-fed hogs.

01:13:31.622 --> 01:13:33.924
- I gotta learn how you do it.
- Of course you do, Farns.

01:13:34.024 --> 01:13:36.360
And so does every other
lonely guy out there in America.

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.062
It's a natural for cable TV.

01:13:38.162 --> 01:13:39.797
Wait'll you hear the name.
This is gonna kill you.

01:13:39.897 --> 01:13:41.965
- You ready? Go ahead.
- "Hunting With Hunter."

01:13:42.065 --> 01:13:43.734
- Is that great or what?
- Every week,

01:13:43.834 --> 01:13:46.203
we send Hunter out to dialogue
a bunch of new hardbodies.

01:13:46.303 --> 01:13:48.072
And Rounder does the BBD update.

01:13:48.172 --> 01:13:50.774
And all we need's a couple
of hundred thousand dollars for a pilot.

01:13:50.874 --> 01:13:54.244
Money is no problem. I love the concept.

01:13:54.344 --> 01:13:55.913
You've got a deal.

01:13:56.013 --> 01:13:57.314
- We got a deal.
- We got a deal.

01:13:57.414 --> 01:14:00.050
All right, it's party time!

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:01.985
You guys are cool. I knew you'd dig it.

01:14:02.085 --> 01:14:05.322
Rag, you're okay. We've got to invite
you the next time we give a party.

01:14:05.422 --> 01:14:07.257
Yeah man, we love to drink a lot of beer!

01:14:07.357 --> 01:14:08.792
And light a lot of farts!

01:14:08.892 --> 01:14:10.427
Wow, that's cool.

01:14:10.527 --> 01:14:13.096
- Yeah, let's party!
- Yeah!

01:14:13.196 --> 01:14:15.121
Party!

01:14:17.734 --> 01:14:19.503
Hang back.

01:14:19.603 --> 01:14:22.639
Okay, that's Hunter right there
in the white jumpsuit.

01:14:22.739 --> 01:14:24.408
Got it.

01:14:24.508 --> 01:14:28.378
Okay, guys, don't start anything until
this party starts to fizzle though, okay?

01:14:28.478 --> 01:14:30.180
When are we gonna know when that is?

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.111
- You'll know.
- All right.

01:14:34.084 --> 01:14:36.053
Hey, all right, how we doing?

01:14:36.153 --> 01:14:37.950
Having a good time.

01:14:39.423 --> 01:14:41.658
Kristi, do me a favor, will ya?
I want you to meet

01:14:41.758 --> 01:14:43.227
a business friend of mine I have here.

01:14:43.327 --> 01:14:45.227
Just show him a good time, okay?

01:14:46.697 --> 01:14:48.332
Show him a good time?

01:14:48.432 --> 01:14:50.834
No, not show him a good time,
show him a good time.

01:14:50.934 --> 01:14:53.337
- Oh, barf.
- Give me a break, will you, Kimberly?

01:14:53.437 --> 01:14:56.907
Farns, come here, I want you
to meet some friends of mine.

01:14:57.007 --> 01:14:58.575
Oh, double barf.

01:14:58.675 --> 01:15:00.911
Uh, Farnsey, this is Kimberly;
Kimberly, this is Farnsey.

01:15:01.011 --> 01:15:02.913
Farnsey, this is Kristi; Kristi, Farnsey.

01:15:03.013 --> 01:15:05.082
Well now, hello, Kristi.

01:15:05.182 --> 01:15:09.152
My friends call me Farnsey,
my enemies call me collect.

01:15:10.821 --> 01:15:14.188
A funny man. Funny rich man.

01:15:19.263 --> 01:15:22.265
Funny girls. Such funny...

01:15:23.365 --> 01:15:24.833
Wait.

01:15:25.002 --> 01:15:27.871
Kristi. Kristi!

01:15:27.971 --> 01:15:29.439
Oh, shit!

01:15:29.539 --> 01:15:31.208
What a shame!

01:15:31.308 --> 01:15:35.746
Hey, you know there's a chance that
won't stain if we soak it right away.

01:15:35.846 --> 01:15:40.517
So why don't you go upstairs
with me and wring it out?

01:15:40.617 --> 01:15:42.219
You can? Okay.

01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:44.721
<i>Come on, baby baby</i>

01:15:44.821 --> 01:15:47.790
<i>Baby, give me the chance</i>

01:15:50.193 --> 01:15:52.729
<i>'Cause I know, I know I can show you</i>

01:15:52.829 --> 01:15:55.093
<i>About romance</i>

01:16:05.242 --> 01:16:09.112
How careless. We will
have to help you wash that out.

01:16:10.747 --> 01:16:12.647
Oh, that's all right.

01:16:17.421 --> 01:16:20.090
That's, uh, a bottle of wine.

01:16:22.893 --> 01:16:24.724
You're gonna spill that on me?

01:16:29.533 --> 01:16:32.502
- Hey, baby, wanna?
- Get out of here.

01:16:32.602 --> 01:16:35.672
Hey, dude, they're lighting farts
down on the beach.

01:16:35.772 --> 01:16:37.708
Well, is it BYOM?

01:16:37.808 --> 01:16:39.676
- What?
- Bring your own matches!

01:16:39.776 --> 01:16:42.946
- Uh, yeah. Yeah yeah.
- All right! Fart fart fart fart!

01:16:43.046 --> 01:16:45.015
Rag, this party's the ultimate bummer.

01:16:45.115 --> 01:16:47.651
- Where is Kristi?
- Upstairs in the bathroom.

01:16:47.751 --> 01:16:50.087
- You're not leaving, are you?
- I'll be right back, okay?

01:16:50.187 --> 01:16:51.745
- Okay?
- Hurry up.

01:16:53.557 --> 01:16:55.525
<i>I'm running</i>

01:16:55.625 --> 01:16:58.295
<i>I'm running away from my heart</i>

01:16:58.395 --> 01:16:59.963
<i>Running</i>

01:17:00.763 --> 01:17:04.368
- Can I help you, honey?
- What's this about a door prize?

01:17:04.468 --> 01:17:07.801
Guess the size of Rounder's putz
and you will win 100 bucks.

01:17:08.872 --> 01:17:10.874
Hey, dude, Kristi's
in the upstairs bathroom.

01:17:10.974 --> 01:17:12.476
Okay.

01:17:12.576 --> 01:17:14.271
<i>And the day comes along...</i>

01:17:15.312 --> 01:17:17.180
Hello there.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.149
I just wondered if you could tell me

01:17:19.249 --> 01:17:21.752
where I could find Roger Rounder.

01:17:21.852 --> 01:17:23.854
Yeah, lady, take a number and go upstairs.

01:17:23.954 --> 01:17:26.323
Oh, all right. How about a little cookie

01:17:26.423 --> 01:17:29.760
for a sweet little girl?

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.988
Roger! Rogie Rogie! Roger!

01:17:36.366 --> 01:17:39.469
- Excuse me, emergency.
- Hey.

01:17:39.569 --> 01:17:41.538
<i>Running...</i>

01:17:41.638 --> 01:17:43.440
- Scotty!
- Kristi, I gotta talk to you.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.876
- Get out of here!
- Just give me two minutes.

01:17:45.976 --> 01:17:49.012
I'm gonna scream at the top of my lungs
if you don't get out of here now.

01:17:49.112 --> 01:17:50.914
- Okay.
- I mean it.

01:17:51.014 --> 01:17:52.783
- Let her rip.
- I mean it.

01:17:52.883 --> 01:17:54.783
Let her rip.

01:17:55.986 --> 01:17:58.614
You can't shift your key.
I can't stay in tune with you.

01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:03.427
Okay, we're gonna act civilized?

01:18:03.527 --> 01:18:05.324
Can we just share a doob, okay?

01:18:06.363 --> 01:18:09.299
Talk this whole thing out, all right?

01:18:09.399 --> 01:18:10.991
Hello there, Goldilocks.

01:18:12.035 --> 01:18:14.026
- What's hanging?
- Spare me.

01:18:17.274 --> 01:18:19.843
Look, I swear to God,

01:18:19.943 --> 01:18:22.411
Hunter made the moves on Candy, not me.

01:18:23.447 --> 01:18:25.506
Hey, I only want you.

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:29.886
Well, you know, there's a real easy way
for me to find out if you're lying.

01:18:29.986 --> 01:18:31.955
Right, polygraph,

01:18:32.055 --> 01:18:33.957
the old lie detector test.

01:18:35.057 --> 01:18:38.028
No, Scotty, all I have to do
is go ask Candy.

01:18:38.128 --> 01:18:40.864
Yeah, right, Candy.

01:18:40.964 --> 01:18:42.866
Yeah, Candy. She'll tell me.

01:18:42.966 --> 01:18:45.335
You know, aside from
that oversized schnozz,

01:18:45.435 --> 01:18:47.104
you're kinda cute.

01:18:47.204 --> 01:18:49.773
What do you say we go
down to my Rolls and fill that...

01:18:49.873 --> 01:18:52.226
bunker with some nose candy?

01:18:53.143 --> 01:18:57.481
You know, that beat of the music
is really strange.

01:18:57.581 --> 01:18:59.416
Really strange.

01:18:59.516 --> 01:19:02.246
No, it really is. Listen to it.

01:19:05.155 --> 01:19:08.091
You'd better let go
or I'll bite you again!

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:10.120
Hey!

01:19:13.062 --> 01:19:14.297
Hey, go dance with somebody else,

01:19:14.397 --> 01:19:16.533
- freckle face.
- He's not dancing.

01:19:16.633 --> 01:19:19.503
He's flipping you off
in 40 different languages.

01:19:19.603 --> 01:19:21.438
Nobody flips me off!

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.521
I never did this before.

01:19:47.964 --> 01:19:49.591
This is my first honey love.

01:20:19.863 --> 01:20:22.399
And now, the Eighth Wonder of the World.

01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:25.930
Roger!

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:28.438
Mom?!

01:20:28.538 --> 01:20:30.140
Roger!

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.708
Mom!

01:20:34.076 --> 01:20:35.540
On fire!

01:20:39.082 --> 01:20:40.650
What... water! Water! Hey!

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:42.519
My feet! My feet! My fuckin' feet!

01:20:45.155 --> 01:20:47.858
Om!

01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:49.359
Big surprise!

01:20:49.459 --> 01:20:50.894
Om!

01:20:58.802 --> 01:21:01.771
- Mom!
- Roger! Roger!

01:21:01.871 --> 01:21:03.874
Dede! Dede!

01:21:03.974 --> 01:21:06.309
If your father were alive...

01:21:06.409 --> 01:21:08.604
<i>Party...</i>

01:21:14.951 --> 01:21:18.088
This party sucks the big one.
Where's Hunter?

01:21:25.462 --> 01:21:28.665
Hunter! Where the fuck are you?!

01:21:37.007 --> 01:21:39.342
- Whoo!
- Oh, shit!

01:21:39.442 --> 01:21:41.678
Hunter sure does give
good party now, don't he?

01:21:41.778 --> 01:21:44.014
For sure, dude.

01:21:47.517 --> 01:21:49.849
<i>It's party time!</i>

01:22:19.649 --> 01:22:22.085
Well, well.

01:22:22.185 --> 01:22:24.210
This is something I never thought I'd see.

01:22:26.222 --> 01:22:28.959
Yeah? Well, he looked
kinda cute last night,

01:22:29.059 --> 01:22:30.627
so I figured what the heck?

01:22:30.727 --> 01:22:32.462
It was rad, dude.

01:22:32.562 --> 01:22:34.797
It was worth the wait.

01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:56.419
- Hi, Scotty.
- Hey.

01:22:56.519 --> 01:22:59.155
I talked to Hunter and he 'fessed up,

01:22:59.255 --> 01:23:01.992
so I guess I owe you an apology.

01:23:02.092 --> 01:23:03.889
You don't have to apologize.

01:23:05.729 --> 01:23:08.064
Well, I've been doing some thinking

01:23:08.164 --> 01:23:10.689
and I've decided to go back to college.

01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:13.236
I think that's great, Kristi.

01:23:13.336 --> 01:23:14.804
Isn't it?

01:23:14.904 --> 01:23:17.668
I don't know what to say.
I hope you have a great year.

01:23:18.708 --> 01:23:20.143
Do I get a goodbye kiss?

01:23:20.243 --> 01:23:21.938
No.

01:23:24.247 --> 01:23:26.049
Come on, I told you
I'm going back to college,

01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:29.019
but I didn't say where.
I'm transferring to Cal State.

01:23:29.119 --> 01:23:30.654
- Cal State?
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:30.754 --> 01:23:32.155
- You mean up on the hill here?
- Right.

01:23:32.255 --> 01:23:33.757
And I thought, you know,

01:23:33.857 --> 01:23:36.326
maybe I could save some money
and we could move in together...

01:23:36.426 --> 01:23:37.861
I mean, if you don't mind.

01:23:37.961 --> 01:23:41.064
Kristi, don't you know
how crazy I am about you?

01:23:41.164 --> 01:23:43.099
Don't you realize my heart
starts to palpitate...

01:23:43.199 --> 01:23:45.568
Do yourself a favor...

01:23:45.668 --> 01:23:47.570
drop the dialogue.

01:23:47.670 --> 01:23:50.468
Your bigger and better deal is
staring you right in the face.

01:24:21.237 --> 01:24:22.706
<i>Look at the way</i>

01:24:22.806 --> 01:24:24.841
<i>The sun makes 'em play</i>

01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:27.666
<i>How can you leave them alone?</i>

01:24:29.012 --> 01:24:32.382
<i>They're on the sand with B-9 in hand</i>

01:24:32.482 --> 01:24:35.285
<i>Caressing the places unknown</i>

01:24:35.385 --> 01:24:38.955
<i>Let me tell you I know a place</i>

01:24:39.055 --> 01:24:43.193
<i>Gonna put a smile on your face</i>

01:24:43.293 --> 01:24:45.895
<i>They got the tan lines on their skin</i>

01:24:45.995 --> 01:24:50.133
<i>Watch them rub it in, rub it in</i>

01:24:50.233 --> 01:24:52.535
<i>- Can you see the hardbodies?
- Hardbodies</i>

01:24:52.635 --> 01:24:54.204
<i>They mean what they say</i>

01:24:54.304 --> 01:24:56.573
<i>There ain't nobody</i>

01:24:56.673 --> 01:24:58.408
<i>Standing in my way</i>

01:24:58.508 --> 01:25:00.276
<i>- See the hardbodies
- Hardbodies</i>

01:25:00.376 --> 01:25:02.278
<i>Do whatever they please</i>

01:25:02.378 --> 01:25:05.615
<i>And everybody's dropping to their knees</i>

01:25:05.715 --> 01:25:08.240
<i>I don't mind</i>

01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:17.594
<i>Second to none, breaking out the big guns</i>

01:25:17.694 --> 01:25:20.663
<i>Waxed up and ready to roll</i>

01:25:21.698 --> 01:25:25.135
<i>As they go by, all the boys wink an eye</i>

01:25:25.235 --> 01:25:27.804
<i>Then simply lose all control</i>

01:25:27.904 --> 01:25:31.808
<i>Let me tell you I know a place</i>

01:25:31.908 --> 01:25:35.278
<i>Gonna make a blind man lead the chase</i>

01:25:35.378 --> 01:25:39.549
<i>Close as you can get to perfection</i>

01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:42.852
<i>So take a look in that direction</i>

01:25:42.952 --> 01:25:45.755
<i>- Can see you the hardbodies?
- Hardbodies</i>

01:25:45.855 --> 01:25:47.557
<i>They mean what they say</i>

01:25:47.657 --> 01:25:50.894
<i>There ain't nobody standing in my way</i>

01:25:50.994 --> 01:25:53.229
<i>See their hardbodies</i>

01:25:53.329 --> 01:25:55.231
<i>Do whatever they please</i>

01:25:55.331 --> 01:25:58.168
<i>And everybody, get down on your knees</i>

01:25:58.268 --> 01:26:00.303
<i>- I don't mind
- Hardbodies</i>

01:26:00.403 --> 01:26:02.906
<i>I don't mind</i>

01:26:03.006 --> 01:26:06.242
<i>Get the boys together
and we'll stand in a line</i>

01:26:06.342 --> 01:26:07.844
<i>- We like to watch you slide
- Hardbodies</i>

01:26:07.944 --> 01:26:10.246
<i>Baby, you can bet</i>

01:26:10.346 --> 01:26:13.917
<i>You and me ain't ever seen
the best of it yet</i>

01:26:14.017 --> 01:26:17.787
<i>Get a load of this, get on over here</i>

01:26:17.887 --> 01:26:21.291
<i>Don't get too excited
when the boys all cheer</i>

01:26:21.391 --> 01:26:22.959
<i>- For hardbodies
- Hardbodies</i>

01:26:23.059 --> 01:26:25.228
<i>Hardbodies</i>

01:26:25.328 --> 01:26:29.299
<i>Don't get too excited when
the boys all cheer for hardbodies</i>

01:26:29.399 --> 01:26:30.700
<i>- Hardbodies
- Hardbodies</i>

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.969
<i>Hardbodies</i>

01:26:33.069 --> 01:26:34.571
<i>Don't get too excited</i>

01:26:34.671 --> 01:26:37.231
