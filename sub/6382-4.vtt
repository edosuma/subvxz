WEBVTT

00:08.759 --> 00:10.359
Was that Warlow out there?

00:10.439 --> 00:12.480
No, some other vampire. Niall's after her.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.439
Shit! We need vampire blood.

00:14.519 --> 00:16.280
Put him down. Put him down.

00:16.359 --> 00:18.800
Check for a pulse.

00:18.879 --> 00:20.120
Get his legs.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.920
Barely.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.719
911. I'll call 911.

00:33.719 --> 00:37.399
Sookie: My brother's unconscious.
He banged his head.

00:37.479 --> 00:40.399
- Yes, it's the yellow house just east of the
cemetery.
- Dispatcher:Yes, ma'am.

00:40.479 --> 00:42.640
We're in the front. Please hurry.

00:42.719 --> 00:44.679
We need an ambulance right away.

01:03.679 --> 01:07.280
When you came in
the air went out

01:10.719 --> 01:15.359
And every shadow
filled up with doubt

01:18.239 --> 01:20.599
I don't know who
you think you are

01:20.680 --> 01:23.480
But before
the night is through

01:25.760 --> 01:28.799
I want to do
bad things with you

01:31.760 --> 01:35.719
I'm the kind
to sit up in his room

01:38.959 --> 01:42.680
Heart sick and eyes
filled up with blue

01:46.040 --> 01:48.599
I don't know what
you've done to me

01:48.680 --> 01:51.719
But I know
this much is true

01:53.719 --> 01:56.519
I want to do
bad things with you

02:12.759 --> 02:14.360
Ow, ooh

02:14.439 --> 02:18.280
I want to do
real bad things with you.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.879
Ah!

02:27.240 --> 02:29.080
How do you know
about Warlow?

02:31.879 --> 02:33.400
Do you know of Lilith?

02:33.479 --> 02:35.000
Lilith who?

02:35.080 --> 02:36.599
She was the first
of all vampires

02:36.680 --> 02:39.520
and she will bring destruction to us all
if we do not stop her.

02:39.599 --> 02:42.360
- Go on. - There was a mistranslation
in our bible.

02:42.439 --> 02:43.960
It read, "The people
led Lilith to the sun."

02:44.039 --> 02:46.000
It should have read, "The progeny led Lilith
to the sun."

02:46.080 --> 02:50.639
Warlow is the progeny.
Only he can kill Lilith.

02:50.719 --> 02:56.439
Oh, my fuck,
you smell amazing.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.680
- Hey, on the road!
- LAVTF!

02:58.759 --> 03:00.919
Announce yourself.
Human or vampire?

03:01.000 --> 03:05.719
-Identify yourself!
- Who the fuck are the LAVT--

03:05.800 --> 03:10.840
Man: Come on, let's go.
She's down.

03:10.919 --> 03:12.759
The ambulance
is on its way.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.240
They said to keep
him elevated.

03:16.919 --> 03:19.120
Hey, Sook.
What'd I miss?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.919
What the hell?
Are you okay?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.199
I was just sat down
with him and he woke up.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.240
I guess he just got
his bell rung or something.

03:24.319 --> 03:26.719
- Oh, my God. - Niall:Thanks
for your help, Ben.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.080
- Did you get her? - I would have if you
hadn't left.

03:30.159 --> 03:33.280
She made it to the main road
and then the DV or BF,

03:33.360 --> 03:35.759
- whoever got to her.
- Jason:Were they LAVTF?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.599
There's a curfew
out on vampires.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.400
It is Sookie
who carries the fae

03:40.479 --> 03:42.439
and it is her
we need to protect,

03:42.520 --> 03:44.319
not her human brother.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.360
I thought he was dying.

03:46.439 --> 03:48.439
I swear.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.960
I made a mistake. I apologize.

03:52.039 --> 03:54.280
Maybe I should just
leave you all to it.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.879
Ben, do you even
have somewhere to stay?

03:56.960 --> 04:00.479
Uh, I'll be at
the La Crescenta.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.360
At least till I figure out
where I'm going next.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.599
I'm glad
your brother's okay.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.800
Me, too.

04:16.199 --> 04:18.560
Rikki:
Hey, we're missing one.

04:18.639 --> 04:21.800
The girl with the crazy hair.
Everybody fan out.

04:21.879 --> 04:24.120
Alcide!

04:24.199 --> 04:25.879
He took Emma!

04:25.959 --> 04:27.720
- Who took Emma?
- Merlotte.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.519
- I smell him in my house.
- Shit.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.160
You should have killed Merlotte when you had
the chance.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.480
Danielle:
Hey, what's going on?

04:33.560 --> 04:36.000
Emma got took.
Sam Merlotte's behind it.

04:36.079 --> 04:39.360
And there's the one that got away.
She's in on it, too.

04:39.439 --> 04:41.560
Her scent's in the SUV.
You pick it up fast.

04:41.639 --> 04:44.000
We've got to catch up.

04:44.079 --> 04:46.279
- Okay.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.759
Now you.

04:48.839 --> 04:51.720
I can't. My leg.

04:51.800 --> 04:56.360
Another 50 feet.
Come on.

04:56.439 --> 04:59.399
- Come on.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.839
Y'all hear that?
Hurry the hell up.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.839
What the hell
is she doing here?

05:03.920 --> 05:06.959
I'll explain later.
We've got to go.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.639
You don't got
to tell me twice.

05:08.720 --> 05:16.480
Come on, Emma.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.160
Burrell: Ginger, put Northman
back on the phone.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.680
He'll be right with you,
Governor.

05:21.759 --> 05:23.680
Who knew a sheepshank

05:23.759 --> 05:25.839
- would be so hard to untie?

05:25.920 --> 05:27.920
Burrell:
That's silver oxide, doll.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.800
-Your vampire friends
can't help you now.

05:30.879 --> 05:33.920
- Freeze! Do not move!

05:34.000 --> 05:35.800
Stop!

05:35.879 --> 05:38.319
- Stop!

05:41.560 --> 05:44.199
- Man:Nothing here.
- Will you hush?!

05:44.279 --> 05:45.879
- Damn.
-Sir.

05:45.959 --> 05:47.600
No sign of Miss Burrell
or the vampires.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.480
They must have made us.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.639
You best tell us
where they've gone.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.600
He's almost got her untied.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.480
Just a few more seconds.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.839
Boy, is Overlark
gonna have fun with you.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.839
- Take her to camp.

06:03.639 --> 06:05.800
Get those choppers
up in the air.

06:05.879 --> 06:08.439
I want this town lit up
like a Christmas tree!

06:08.519 --> 06:10.319
- Yes, sir.
- And watch the sky.

06:10.399 --> 06:13.199
That peckerwood's
gonna try to fly out.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.120
Summon her again.

06:29.199 --> 06:31.480
She's close.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.279
I can smell you
from here.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.319
- Where's the girl?
- You're never gonna get her.

06:41.399 --> 06:44.079
- Oh, really? - As your maker,

06:44.160 --> 06:45.680
- I command--

06:45.759 --> 06:48.839
If you don't want to listen to your
maker's commands, fine.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.160
But you will
listen to mine.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.079
- Where is the girl?
- Fuck you.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.319
- Get off of her. She's mi--
- Shut up, Pam!

06:59.279 --> 07:01.399
Where is she?

07:01.480 --> 07:04.680
The fairground
off I-20.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.800
You have no right
to lay your hands on her.

07:08.879 --> 07:10.759
We'll meet back here
tomorrow night.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.920
Asshole.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.399
Reporter:
Meanwhile, in Afghanistan,

07:16.480 --> 07:18.600
a suicide bomber
killed 20 civilians

07:18.680 --> 07:29.360
-including five--

07:29.439 --> 07:31.800
- What?
- We hear you thinking.

07:31.879 --> 07:34.759
You're sad about,
um, Patrick.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.920
That's right,
I am sad.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.279
I liked Patrick
very much.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.240
And when he left,
it made me very, very sad.

07:44.319 --> 07:46.439
No, you killed him.

07:46.519 --> 07:49.199
- I did not!
- You shot your friend.

07:49.279 --> 07:52.639
- We know your secret.
- His brains came out.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.120
-You're a killer.

07:54.199 --> 07:55.800
Quiet! Stop!

07:55.879 --> 07:58.720
Arlene!
I need backup!

08:01.560 --> 08:04.240
They know.
They know about...

08:04.319 --> 08:07.319
Oh, God.
Um, okay.

08:07.399 --> 08:10.600
Now, girls,
your Uncle Terry,

08:10.680 --> 08:13.000
he has a very active
imagination.

08:13.079 --> 08:15.839
And it's rude
to snoop around in it.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.399
You understand?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.240
Yes, ma'am.

08:19.319 --> 08:22.040
What the hell
is going on?

08:24.439 --> 08:27.079
Oh.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.519
Come on, it's time
for bed anyhow.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.160
You ain't slept
since you were three.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.000
- Let's go.
- Oh!

08:34.080 --> 08:35.759
- I don't want to go to bed.
- Andy:All right, girls,

08:35.840 --> 08:37.919
- let's leave Uncle Terry alone.
- Girl #3:Fine.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.000
They're children.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.799
No one would even
believe them anyway.

08:44.879 --> 08:46.960
But I know
what I did.

08:48.320 --> 08:55.159
I can't fake it anymore.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.279
- All right, everybody in.
- We're not tired.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.960
Well, somebody's got
to look after you,

08:59.039 --> 09:00.960
and that somebody
turned out to be me.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.320
It's my sacred duty.

09:04.399 --> 09:06.600
That's what
your mama said.

09:06.679 --> 09:09.480
But I'll let you all in
on a little secret.

09:09.559 --> 09:11.320
I'm glad I got the job.

09:11.399 --> 09:13.440
We know.
We can hear your brain.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.360
Hey, hey, hey,
no telepathy.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.480
- That's illegal
in these parts.

09:17.559 --> 09:20.639
That's coming from the sheriff
of this here parish.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.879
All right,
good night, darlings.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.240
Girls:
Good night, Daddy.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.519
- Girl #1:What the heck?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.600
- Girl #2:Hey, you
kicked me off!

09:30.679 --> 09:32.480
Girl #3: I did not.
I didn't move.

09:32.559 --> 09:34.639
Girl #2:
Oh, God, you feel that?

09:34.720 --> 09:37.039
Girl #4: It's happening again.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.480
Girl #2:
Only this time it's...

09:39.559 --> 09:41.559
Oh, God!

09:45.919 --> 09:47.759
Holy fuck!
Look at my boobs!

09:47.840 --> 09:48.960
Quiet, Dad's
gonna hear you.

09:49.039 --> 09:50.159
Look at my boobs.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.720
- Mine are prettier than yours.
- Fuck you.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.519
- Jealous.
- Stop it.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.240
Shut up.
Who cares?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.080
I don't want
to stay in bed.

09:57.159 --> 09:59.080
We might be 30
by the time we wake up.

09:59.159 --> 10:02.720
We got to get out,
party and drink.

10:02.799 --> 10:05.559
But how are we gonna go anywhere without
a car or clothes?

10:05.639 --> 10:08.120
I don't know about you, but I'm raiding
Aunt Arlene's closet.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.639
I thought you said
he had four faerie kids.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.559
He did.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.080
But you smell that,
don't you?

10:24.159 --> 10:28.720
Yeah.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.159
Whoo!

10:30.240 --> 10:32.639
Bill: Another mystery for
Dr. Takahashi to unravel.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.240
- When he calms down.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.919
- Let's go get beer!

10:49.679 --> 10:51.320
Why aren't you in bed?

10:51.399 --> 10:52.759
Oh, hey.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.159
Sook, you ain't got
to worry about me.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.240
I ain't never felt
better in my whole life.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.879
238, 239,

11:00.960 --> 11:03.720
240, 241...

11:03.799 --> 11:05.559
You can stand there
and count if you want.

11:05.639 --> 11:06.799
243...

11:28.519 --> 11:29.960
Ben:I was sat with him
and he just woke up.

11:30.039 --> 11:31.639
I guess he just got
his bell rung.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.679
Did you ever see
blood do this?

11:44.360 --> 11:46.399
Motherfucker.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.360
- All right, everybody...
- Shh.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.159
...look older.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.519
- Okay.
- Be cool.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.480
Do I look all right?

12:18.159 --> 12:20.200
Hey, wait.

12:20.279 --> 12:21.600
Let me do it.

12:21.679 --> 12:23.960
- I can be very persuasive.
- And very impulsive.

12:24.039 --> 12:26.919
- You don't trust me?
- I trust Bill.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.039
But I also know there's a fight going on inside
you

12:29.120 --> 12:32.440
between Bill and Lilith and I just want to make
sure
she doesn't win tonight.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.399
Those girls, they're also the same age
I was when you turned me.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.720
If anything were
to happen to them, I--

12:37.799 --> 12:39.639
I'd never forgive myself.

12:51.519 --> 12:53.200
You girls got ID?

12:53.279 --> 12:55.799
Crap. We forgot it
at home.

12:55.879 --> 12:58.879
- But we're totally 21.
- 27.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.720
Mmm, I ain't supposed
to sell without ID.

13:01.799 --> 13:03.679
But you know what?
There is a way to check.

13:03.759 --> 13:06.120
A little known fact
of anatomy.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.159
I can show you
in the back.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.320
Oh, that's okay.
I got it.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.240
You don't need to see
my ID, now, do you?

13:17.320 --> 13:19.919
Uh, no.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.080
Good. Now forget
you ever saw us.

13:23.159 --> 13:26.200
Yeah, okay.

13:28.919 --> 13:31.320
My name's Jessica.
What's yours?

13:31.399 --> 13:33.240
Um, we don't have names.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.159
Oh, my gosh.
That is so cool.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.080
I mean, I hate
having a name.

13:38.159 --> 13:40.919
You know, I always got to be like,
"Hey, my name is Jessica."

13:41.000 --> 13:44.720
How lame is that, right?
That is so fucking cool.

13:44.799 --> 13:47.200
I guess it is
kind of cool.

13:47.279 --> 13:50.600
Hey, you guys want
to come over to my place?

13:50.679 --> 13:52.559
Hey, we can party there.

13:52.639 --> 13:56.320
The thing is, um,
you smell kind of funny.

13:56.399 --> 13:58.159
You're not like us,
are you?

13:59.480 --> 14:02.200
Uh, no.
No, I'm not.

14:02.279 --> 14:04.960
Actually,
the truth is...

14:05.039 --> 14:06.600
I'm a vampire.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.720
- Please don't freak out.

14:08.799 --> 14:11.639
'Cause I'm really old and I can totally
control myself.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.679
I mean, I have tons
of faerie friends.

14:14.759 --> 14:16.480
Just think of me
like a regular girl,

14:16.559 --> 14:18.360
you know,
looking for a party.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.320
Come on, what do you think?
It'll be super fun.

14:20.399 --> 14:22.679
Okay, let's go.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.240
Oh, my God,
it's, like, so wrong.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.360
My colleague Dr. Takahashi will instruct
you where to place everything.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.440
Thank you for delivering
on such short notice.

14:33.519 --> 14:36.080
- Girl #1: Who's that?
- Hey, I made some new friends.

14:36.159 --> 14:38.440
- I see that.
- Girls, this here's Bill.

14:38.519 --> 14:40.759
Hi, Bill.
Cool ride.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.679
It's gonna be
a little cozy in there.

14:42.759 --> 14:45.240
You'll have to squeeze in.

14:46.799 --> 14:48.039
Should we do
something about--

14:48.120 --> 14:49.960
- Did you glamor the clerk?
- Yeah.

14:50.039 --> 14:51.320
Well, leave it, then.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.320
See?
Doesn't that feel nice?

15:11.559 --> 15:13.559
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:13.639 --> 15:16.720
Smooth
as a baby's bottom.

15:16.799 --> 15:18.879
Do you want
to do me now?

15:40.320 --> 15:43.440
- Okay. - You haven't done this
before, have you?

15:44.519 --> 15:46.679
Uh, no.
Not really.

15:46.759 --> 15:48.120
Just relax.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.559
Do it like you do it
to yourself.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.279
Oh, shit.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.840
Sorry, man.
I got you there.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.759
It's okay.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.360
Taste it.

16:18.919 --> 16:20.559
Ah!

16:31.320 --> 16:33.799
You wanted
to show me something?

16:33.879 --> 16:36.480
I wondered if you might be interested in some
historical artifacts.

16:36.559 --> 16:40.159
I think history
is really sexy.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.279
What's that?

16:45.399 --> 16:47.919
It's a little toy
that we vampires use

16:48.000 --> 16:50.320
with our partners.

16:50.399 --> 16:53.200
You know, after hundreds
of years, it can get weary

16:53.279 --> 16:55.080
using your fangs
all the time.

16:55.159 --> 16:59.600
So sometimes it can
be nice just to watch.

16:59.679 --> 17:02.320
Mind if I try it
on you?

17:02.399 --> 17:05.160
Sure.
Sounds fun.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.920
- Shh.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.240
It's all right.

17:22.319 --> 17:26.240
In fact,
it's extraordinary.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.960
You see,
we vampires...

17:31.640 --> 17:34.079
we're creatures of blood.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.400
Blood is everything to us.

17:36.480 --> 17:40.480
So this is like foreplay?

17:40.559 --> 17:42.319
Not exactly.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.799
Now, I want you to go
and see your sisters.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.720
- But I thought--
- All in good time.

17:48.799 --> 17:50.440
You don't want
to miss the party.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.319
Go.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.640
I'm fine.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.359
What the hell
is going on?

18:11.440 --> 18:14.359
Everything is to your satisfaction,
familiar, I trust?

18:14.440 --> 18:16.960
Everything from
our Tru Blood lab.

18:17.039 --> 18:19.279
Yes. And anything else you need,
you just ask.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.960
I'm a great admirer
of yours, Doctor.

18:23.039 --> 18:25.119
You have helped my kind
in immeasurable ways.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.279
And now I need to ask
one more favor.

18:28.359 --> 18:32.440
This blood,
unlike normal human blood,

18:32.519 --> 18:35.559
has properties
that are very special.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.720
Magical, even.

18:37.799 --> 18:40.559
Properties that can save
vampirekind from extinction.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.759
I need you to map the genetic code
of this blood,

18:44.839 --> 18:46.240
to replicate it
and synthesize it

18:46.319 --> 18:47.920
just like you did
human blood.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.039
Where did you
get it from?

18:51.119 --> 18:53.759
Now let's not
go down that road.

18:53.839 --> 18:56.240
- And if I fail?
- Failure is not an option.

19:15.839 --> 19:17.920
Miss Burrell.

19:20.759 --> 19:23.240
Why are you still here?

19:23.319 --> 19:25.759
I knew you'd come.

19:25.839 --> 19:28.359
I wanted to talk
to you, so I stayed.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.720
So...

19:36.799 --> 19:38.799
you have my attention.

19:40.519 --> 19:42.480
What was it you wanted
to say to me?

19:43.519 --> 19:45.440
I despise
what my father is doing

19:45.519 --> 19:47.160
and it makes me sick
to my stomach

19:47.240 --> 19:49.160
knowing what he's up to.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.079
I'm on your side.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.079
And I also wanted
to say that

19:59.160 --> 20:01.079
before,

20:01.160 --> 20:04.160
in Ginger's coffin...

20:06.640 --> 20:09.400
why didn't you let me
taste your blood?

20:11.319 --> 20:14.640
Why did you want
to taste it so badly?

20:14.720 --> 20:18.119
I think I deserve to.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.640
Oh?

20:19.720 --> 20:21.720
Do you?

20:30.119 --> 20:32.079
Do you really
want to help me?

20:34.720 --> 20:36.400
I do.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.000
Hmm.

20:57.039 --> 20:58.880
This'll do.

21:25.319 --> 21:27.519
Oh, my God.

21:32.279 --> 21:34.720
Just so you know, I'm--

21:34.799 --> 21:37.559
I'm a virgin,
pretty much.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.119
So much courage.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.200
So little experience.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.880
How are you feeling?

22:03.599 --> 22:05.640
- Excited.
- Hmm?

22:07.119 --> 22:09.119
And scared.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.559
Mmm.

22:12.799 --> 22:18.319
Death is not the end.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.799
Is it gonna hurt?

22:21.079 --> 22:23.160
Not the way I do it.

23:00.599 --> 23:02.920
Everything your father
put in you--

23:03.000 --> 23:06.519
his cowardice,

23:06.599 --> 23:09.039
his small-mindedness,
his hate--

23:11.200 --> 23:14.000
all of it will seep out.

23:14.079 --> 23:15.720
And into this vessel

23:15.799 --> 23:18.400
I will seed
a millennium of wisdom,

23:18.480 --> 23:22.559
honor, life.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.519
Why--

23:25.599 --> 23:27.640
why did you choose me?

23:29.960 --> 23:35.720
You deserve
to be one of us.

23:35.799 --> 23:38.480
I'm gonna let you taste
my blood now, Willa.

23:38.559 --> 23:40.079
Okay?

24:16.440 --> 24:18.480
Oh, my God.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.279
Damn it. Nobody's responded
to my texts or nothing.

24:24.359 --> 24:26.599
Listen, I can't
have you texting.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.640
All right? You don't know
who's on the other end.

24:30.359 --> 24:31.839
But those are my people.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.680
Those are my brothers,
my sister.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.319
They're all gone,
aren't they?

24:38.480 --> 24:40.240
All of them.

24:40.319 --> 24:43.119
I'm sorry
your friends died.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.319
My mommy died
a few days ago.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.480
I know she did, Emma.

24:48.559 --> 24:51.000
Hey, Nicole.

24:51.079 --> 24:52.680
- Nicole.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.759
- Honey, where are you going?
- I'm going out of your hair.

24:55.839 --> 24:58.240
Just gonna slow you down
if I tag along.

24:58.319 --> 25:00.480
Well, how far
you think you can get?

25:00.559 --> 25:02.200
Weres are the best
trackers around.

25:02.279 --> 25:07.799
You won't get two miles
before they rip you to pieces.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.599
You're a smart woman, Nicole.
Don't be stupid.

25:10.680 --> 25:13.799
You dying ain't gonna bring your friends back
and you know it.

25:15.039 --> 25:17.000
Sammy, she gonna need
that leg looked at.

25:17.079 --> 25:19.880
Maybe in 100 miles out,
we can find a doctor--

25:19.960 --> 25:22.319
It's not we, all right?
This is my mess.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.119
You already done more
than I asked you to.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.519
So take your car,
get out of here.

25:25.599 --> 25:27.519
Don't let your guard
down, either.

25:27.599 --> 25:31.240
I'm telling you, go. Get the Smith & Wesson
from my office.

25:31.319 --> 25:32.759
It's tucked in
the fireplace damper.

25:32.839 --> 25:34.359
You sure you don't
need nothing else?

25:34.440 --> 25:37.319
No, thank you.
Now go on, Lafayette.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.279
Now go on,
get the fuck out of here.

25:39.359 --> 25:41.599
Hey, how we gonna run
without a car?

25:41.680 --> 25:44.039
What the hell
are you doing?

25:44.119 --> 25:45.880
I'm gonna carry you.

25:45.960 --> 25:46.960
Know all your questions
about shifters...

25:47.039 --> 25:48.559
-and how we do it?
- Uh-uh.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.880
Here's your answer.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.640
Shit!

26:03.279 --> 26:05.640
Sookie. Hi.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.200
Let me grab a shirt.

26:07.279 --> 26:09.599
It's all right.
Remember, I put those on.

26:11.039 --> 26:12.240
All right.

26:12.319 --> 26:14.839
What can I do for you?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.279
Well, I just wanted to apologize for how
Niall talked to you.

26:17.359 --> 26:21.279
He's not from the South
or this millennium

26:21.359 --> 26:22.920
and he can be
kind of blunt.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.160
Well, thanks.
I appreciate it.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.839
Also...

26:27.920 --> 26:29.920
I don't want to get
all Sadie Hawkins on you,

26:30.000 --> 26:34.079
but I think at least you deserve a home-cooked
meal for your trouble.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.000
Why don't you come over tonight
and I'll fix you supper?

26:37.079 --> 26:39.279
- I'd like that very much.
- Okay, swing by around 7:00.

26:39.359 --> 26:40.720
It'll give me time
to make the groceries

26:40.799 --> 26:42.720
and give you time
to put a shirt on.

26:42.799 --> 26:44.319
It's a date.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.599
I didn't say that,
now, did I?

26:50.599 --> 26:52.920
You've reached Officer Jason Stackhouse.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.200
Leave a message.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.160
Hey, Jason, it's me.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.559
When you wake up,
I need a favor.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.759
I'm fixing supper
for Ben tonight

27:00.839 --> 27:03.759
and I was hoping that maybe you and Niall
could go to a movie

27:03.839 --> 27:06.599
or, I don't know,
something.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.400
Ben will be there
in case anything happens,

27:08.480 --> 27:11.960
but it'd be kind of nice to have my own house to
myself
just for one night.

27:12.039 --> 27:13.599
Anyway...

27:15.279 --> 27:16.319
I'm glad you're
feeling better.

27:16.400 --> 27:21.240
All right, talk soon.

27:21.319 --> 27:22.960
Andy:
Come on.

27:23.039 --> 27:25.240
Stackhouse, pick up
your goddamn phone already.

27:25.319 --> 27:26.759
Please,
this is an emergency.

27:26.839 --> 27:28.319
I need all hands on deck.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.559
- What? - Sheriff, I cannot
put out an APB

27:30.640 --> 27:32.279
without a proper
description.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.319
Just do this for me, Kev--
four Caucasian females,

27:35.400 --> 27:37.319
between four
and seven feet tall,

27:37.400 --> 27:39.519
between 60 and 260 pounds,

27:39.599 --> 27:42.640
and between the ages of 10
and, I don't know, 50.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.480
Now come on, do some fucking police
work for a change.

27:45.559 --> 27:48.839
Well, it's like that man
in the video taught us.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.519
Half of all missing children

27:50.599 --> 27:52.720
are taken by a relative.

27:52.799 --> 27:55.680
Well, their mama didn't want 'em and it
sure as shit wasn't me.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.240
Why don't you
question the nut

27:57.319 --> 27:59.799
who goes all twitchy whenever one of my kids
comes near?

27:59.880 --> 28:02.480
- Whoa, hey! - How dare you talk
about Terry that way?

28:02.559 --> 28:04.039
Well, I've been running
around town since dawn.

28:04.119 --> 28:06.000
I ain't found squat.
What am I supposed to think?

28:06.079 --> 28:08.599
Terry: They took the car out
for a joyride.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.039
We've all done it. They're probably out
having fun.

28:11.119 --> 28:14.799
In case you haven't noticed, it ain't exactly safe
out
there these days.

28:14.880 --> 28:18.400
Well, it's lucky their old man is the sheriff
of this parish.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.000
You have the whole department
at your beck and call.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.240
I don't think
I can be a cop in this.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.759
Those are my kids.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.519
I can't even
think straight.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.160
Where's Sook?

28:39.240 --> 28:41.440
She had to go
to work early.

28:42.599 --> 28:45.640
How's my wounded warrior?

28:45.720 --> 28:47.079
Your what?

28:47.160 --> 28:49.319
Oh, my head's fine.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.400
I just didn't sleep
too good.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.079
Something on your mind?

28:58.960 --> 29:00.720
Even though
you're a faerie,

29:00.799 --> 29:04.440
you're kind of a straight
type of faerie, right?

29:04.519 --> 29:06.599
I mean, you have to be
to have faerie kids.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.200
What are you getting at?

29:09.279 --> 29:13.440
Have you ever
had a dream that...

29:13.519 --> 29:15.119
ain't so straight?

29:18.920 --> 29:21.039
- Do you want to do me now?

29:21.119 --> 29:24.400
That Ben
is a handsome fella.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.240
I couldn't help it!

29:26.319 --> 29:28.480
It just happened.

29:28.559 --> 29:31.079
It was like the times
I had vampire blood.

29:31.160 --> 29:35.279
But you faeries, you don't make people
dream like that.

29:35.359 --> 29:36.880
Do you?

29:36.960 --> 29:40.720
Not anyone
I've ever known.

29:40.799 --> 29:43.440
Unless...

29:43.519 --> 29:45.799
no, that's unthinkable.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.759
No, no, no, no.
Spit it out.

29:47.839 --> 29:49.240
Tell me what
you're unthinking.

29:49.319 --> 29:53.279
Suppose at one point

29:53.359 --> 29:55.839
a vampire was able
to turn a fae

29:55.920 --> 29:57.279
into their own kind.

30:00.039 --> 30:01.240
A faerie vampire.

30:01.319 --> 30:04.200
I never imagined
such a mongrel could exist.

30:04.279 --> 30:08.079
But if it did, I suppose they might
have both powers.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.960
- Faerie and vampire.
- Vampire.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.880
- Ben.
-It must be.

30:16.960 --> 30:20.319
He must have
given me his blood.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.960
He healed me.

30:22.039 --> 30:25.599
He's a vampire
who walks in daylight.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.039
- Oh, we got to call Sookie.
- No. No.

30:28.119 --> 30:29.920
What?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Grandpa, you're the one who taught her the crazy
light ball trick.

30:32.079 --> 30:34.680
If anyone deserves
to kill Warlow, it's her.

30:34.759 --> 30:37.200
Warlow orphaned me, too.

30:37.279 --> 30:40.960
I want that fucker myself.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.079
- That was easy.
- Yeah.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.759
Thank Governor Burrell.

30:56.839 --> 30:59.599
These days you don't even need a warrant
if it's vamp related.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.000
- Can't you just blast him
through the window?

31:02.079 --> 31:05.720
He's older than me.
He's a fae and a vampire.

31:05.799 --> 31:08.279
We only have one shot.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.920
Niall: He's getting in the shower.
Let's go.

32:00.079 --> 32:03.880
Hyaa!
He's gone!

32:03.960 --> 32:05.839
Fuck!

32:06.880 --> 32:08.559
Jason.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.599
Good.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.279
You never came here.

32:18.119 --> 32:19.960
You never found me.

32:20.039 --> 32:23.759
This search has
caused you so much pain.

32:23.839 --> 32:25.920
Let that pain go.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.960
Does Sookie
know about me?

32:28.039 --> 32:30.000
No, we came
straight here.

32:30.079 --> 32:31.559
Good.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.480
- Go to work. Do your job.
- Okay.

32:35.559 --> 32:37.440
Stay away from Sookie's place tonight.
"

32:37.519 --> 32:39.279
We have plans.

32:39.359 --> 32:42.400
What about Grandpa?

32:42.480 --> 32:44.559
If you want to say good-bye,
now would be the time.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.319
Okay.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.079
Good-bye, Grandpa.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.559
We tried.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.319
Jason.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.079
Shh.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.319
By the time
you get to the car,

33:10.400 --> 33:12.960
this awful burden
will be lifted from you.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.000
Go.

34:06.519 --> 34:08.119
That's her.
It's fresh, too.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.440
Can't be more
than a few hours.

34:09.519 --> 34:12.079
Trail goes north from here,
Packmaster, but it's fainter.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.000
Probably stopped here
for a break and kept driving.

34:14.079 --> 34:15.679
- Push on, we can catch up.
- Rikki.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.760
Get everyone and take 'em back
to the compound.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.599
Make sure we wipe
that place down good.

34:19.679 --> 34:22.079
- Are you fucking kidding?
- Who is your packmaster?

34:25.239 --> 34:27.719
Jackson's coming north
with me to follow Merlotte.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.519
Everyone clear
on their place in this?

34:54.559 --> 34:56.280
Promising news,
I hope.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.360
There are compounds
in this blood

34:58.440 --> 35:00.320
which never appear
in human blood--

35:00.400 --> 35:02.360
traces of mercury, neon,
titanium, francium.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.239
Chemically, I don't even
have a name for them.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.079
But you can see
what looks like crystals

35:08.159 --> 35:09.880
amongst the other
blood cells.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.000
That's exactly
what we need.

35:13.079 --> 35:15.159
Unfortunately,
it's highly unstable.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.719
Its half-life
is less than 20 seconds

35:17.800 --> 35:19.599
and within an hour
we have this.

35:20.559 --> 35:22.480
Ordinary human blood.

35:22.559 --> 35:24.280
Outside of their host,

35:24.360 --> 35:27.079
these compounds decompose
almost immediately.

35:27.159 --> 35:29.119
I can't replicate them

35:29.199 --> 35:32.159
if it's disintegrating
in front of me.

35:32.239 --> 35:34.840
I'll go get more.
I've got donors upstairs.

35:34.920 --> 35:37.599
Donors? You've got more
prisoners upstairs, too?

35:37.679 --> 35:39.519
No, this--

35:39.599 --> 35:41.039
this is an outrage.

35:41.119 --> 35:42.760
I will not work
under these conditions.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.280
- Oh, I will go get more.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.519
And you will not stop
until you synthesize it.

35:48.599 --> 35:53.840
Do you understand?

35:53.920 --> 35:56.000
All right, that's enough.

36:00.079 --> 36:02.960
A little bonus
for short notice.

36:03.039 --> 36:04.840
Hazard pay.

36:07.679 --> 36:09.239
You're a good man, Bjorne.

36:13.599 --> 36:15.760
Oh, my God.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.559
It's like
everything's electric.

36:19.639 --> 36:22.880
Well, the world you knew
as a human was a sliver

36:22.960 --> 36:26.599
of what you'll
be feeling now.

36:26.679 --> 36:28.719
So what happens next?

36:28.800 --> 36:30.960
Are we gonna fuck?

36:31.039 --> 36:32.519
Do we hunt?

36:33.960 --> 36:35.599
You're going home, Willa.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.079
Go home to your father.

36:39.159 --> 36:41.760
Let him see his own child
turned into the thing

36:41.840 --> 36:43.360
that repulses him most.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.719
You did this to me

36:45.800 --> 36:48.119
to get back at him?

36:48.199 --> 36:49.760
You took my life.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.480
Just as he's taken
so many of ours.

36:52.559 --> 36:55.199
Oh, my God.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.039
He was right.

36:57.119 --> 37:00.199
You're a fucking monster!
No!

37:00.280 --> 37:03.719
Prove to your father
that you're not a monster.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.400
Make him understand
that we were all once human.

37:07.480 --> 37:12.199
We are not to be hunted.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.679
No.

37:15.639 --> 37:19.559
I've been around for over 1,000 years,
Willa Burrell.

37:19.639 --> 37:22.800
And you are the second
vampire I've ever made.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.519
Now, I did not make
this decision lightly.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.840
- I have to send you back.
- No.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.400
As your maker,
I command you.

37:36.119 --> 37:37.599
Go home to your father.

37:49.599 --> 37:51.440
Come on, that building
looks promising.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.920
- For what? - We got to eat,
don't we?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.920
Just stay calm and don't walk faster
than 30 miles an hour.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.559
We'll be fine.

37:58.639 --> 38:00.760
Keep an eye out for
a seven-pointed star.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.639
There are still a few speakeasies
operating under the radar

38:03.719 --> 38:06.360
where we can find
a willing human donor.

38:06.440 --> 38:10.280
That is, if you're still interested in
feeding on humans.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.679
Did I just hear
you right?

38:11.760 --> 38:13.159
You blaming me
for last night?

38:13.239 --> 38:15.079
Look,
Eric mistreated you,

38:15.159 --> 38:17.039
but you've got to admit that human loving
is fucked up.

38:17.119 --> 38:18.239
That girl
is on our side.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.760
She hates what
her father is doing.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.079
I don't give a fuck
what she hates.

38:22.159 --> 38:24.639
This is war.
It is us against them.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.679
What is it gonna take
for you to understand?

38:26.760 --> 38:29.519
Fuck it.
You go feed on your own.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.519
I don't have to listen
to this shit.

38:32.679 --> 38:36.760
Man:
Vampire!

38:36.840 --> 38:40.599
- Fuck!
- Stay where you are!

38:40.679 --> 38:42.320
Man:No, sir.
No sign of your daughter.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.719
But we have captured
several vampires.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.760
I don't care.

38:46.840 --> 38:50.079
You keep 'em on the job
around the fucking clock.

38:50.159 --> 38:54.360
- Do you hear me?
-Yes, sir.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.039
They're gonna find her.

38:56.119 --> 38:58.760
- I don't know. - They're gonna
bring her back.

39:00.519 --> 39:03.920
Come on. Let me take your mind
off all this awfulness.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.599
Sarah.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.920
There's something that I wanted to talk
to you about, baby.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.400
It's not a good time,
I know,

39:14.480 --> 39:16.920
but there's never
a good time these days.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.320
-Sir.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.280
Sir, it's an emergency.
I need to come in.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.239
-It's about your daughter.
- What?

39:22.320 --> 39:24.079
-Your daughter.
- Get in here.

39:26.119 --> 39:27.920
Sir, there's something
you need to know.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.320
We had to invite her in.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.920
Oh, God.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.480
- Sir, listen, I need for you to stay back--
- Jimmy, get out.

39:39.559 --> 39:41.480
Leave us alone.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.920
Come on, let's go.

39:51.199 --> 39:53.079
What have they
done to you?

39:55.239 --> 39:57.599
Stay back.

39:57.679 --> 39:59.440
Daddy.

39:59.519 --> 40:03.360
I'm a vampire now,
but I am still me.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.079
You can see that, right?

40:05.159 --> 40:07.360
I'm still Willa.

40:10.239 --> 40:12.119
God, you're cold.

40:12.199 --> 40:15.039
You have to stop
what you're doing, Daddy.

40:15.119 --> 40:18.400
You have to stop persecuting us.
*

40:18.480 --> 40:19.719
Us?

40:19.800 --> 40:21.639
What do you mean, us?

40:21.719 --> 40:23.239
Us. Vampires.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.519
If you still love me,

40:25.599 --> 40:27.280
if you care
about me at all,

40:27.360 --> 40:30.320
then you will
call off your dogs.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.039
You will dismantle
the LAVTF

40:33.119 --> 40:36.679
and you will shut down
that terrible camp.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.000
Don't listen to her, Truman.
That's the devil talking.

40:39.079 --> 40:40.599
God damn it, Sarah!

40:44.880 --> 40:47.320
It's my daughter.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.599
This is my daughter.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.639
- Mmm.

40:52.719 --> 40:58.960
Willa?

40:59.039 --> 41:01.760
You've got to send her
to camp, Truman.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.519
Baby, I'm sorry, but you've got
to let her go.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.199
Warlow.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.079
You can't vanish,
old man.

41:55.159 --> 41:56.760
I've drained almost
all your blood.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.079
Don't even try it.

41:59.159 --> 42:06.639
The fight's over.

42:06.719 --> 42:09.719
Are we not kindred?

42:09.800 --> 42:11.039
Yes, we are.

42:11.119 --> 42:14.920
My family and I,
we lived beside yours

42:15.000 --> 42:17.920
for years
when I was still fae.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.079
Just before
you were born,

42:21.159 --> 42:23.000
I was turned.

42:23.079 --> 42:26.000
The darkness in me,

42:26.079 --> 42:30.239
it battles with the light
every second of my being.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.960
But even on the darkest day
thousands of years ago,

42:34.039 --> 42:36.880
as I stood over the dust

42:36.960 --> 42:39.800
of my own mother
and father...

42:41.719 --> 42:44.000
I couldn't bear
to kill a child.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.440
You spared me?

42:48.519 --> 42:50.360
Yes, I did.

42:50.440 --> 42:53.400
So that our line
could continue.

42:53.480 --> 42:57.840
And now, my kindred,
I shall spare you again.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.639
No, not there!

43:04.719 --> 43:06.920
- No!
- Shh.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.440
I survived 20 years.

43:09.519 --> 43:12.519
I'm sure a king
can survive longer.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.280
She asleep?

43:28.360 --> 43:30.079
Yeah.

43:31.880 --> 43:34.280
It's amazing the way kids
can block things out

43:34.360 --> 43:36.400
when sleep comes a-calling.

43:38.239 --> 43:40.360
For me, it's gonna take
a whole lot of this.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.960
Mind if I have a swig?

43:55.199 --> 43:56.480
God.

43:56.559 --> 43:59.760
I can hear them

43:59.840 --> 44:05.119
screaming.

44:05.199 --> 44:07.800
My friends.

44:07.880 --> 44:10.760
- Shh.

44:22.599 --> 44:24.760
I still see Luna.

44:26.519 --> 44:28.039
I try and block it out,

44:28.119 --> 44:30.079
but at the same time,
I don't want to let her go.

44:30.159 --> 44:32.400
- You know?
- You saw her die?

44:35.400 --> 44:37.679
In my arms, yeah.

44:37.760 --> 44:40.239
Jesus.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.679
I've hardly stopped
to think about that.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.400
- God.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.920
Yeah.

45:54.039 --> 45:55.280
How mad are you?

45:55.360 --> 45:57.840
I just thought you were
more of a gentleman is all.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.159
Do you think you can find it somewhere in your
heart to forgive me?

46:00.239 --> 46:02.880
Well, I guess
you can come in.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.320
But you're gonna have to work extra hard
to make it up to me.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.559
I don't mind hard work.

46:07.639 --> 46:09.079
Keeps a man honest.

46:12.440 --> 46:14.000
- You must be hungry.
- Mm-hmm.

46:14.079 --> 46:15.719
Dig in.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.239
Is something wrong?

46:21.320 --> 46:23.880
Mm-mmm. I just love the smell
of home cooking.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.000
This smells amazing.
Really, it does.

46:27.199 --> 46:28.400
You're not eating?

46:28.480 --> 46:30.079
Oh, you know,
when my mama was alive,

46:30.159 --> 46:32.480
she always used to say
that she took more pleasure

46:32.559 --> 46:35.559
in watching other people eating her food than
eating it herself.

46:35.639 --> 46:39.119
I never knew what
she meant until tonight.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.960
Oh, that is good.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.239
It goes perfect
with the wine.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.039
I didn't even know
you were frying this chicken.

46:47.119 --> 46:49.159
It's a perfect match.

46:49.239 --> 46:50.599
Mm.

46:53.079 --> 46:55.360
So...

46:55.440 --> 46:59.159
last night you asked
about my ex.

46:59.239 --> 47:01.119
I think I ought to fess up.
1

47:01.199 --> 47:02.639
He's--

47:02.719 --> 47:04.199
he's a vampire.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.840
Yeah, I kind of guessed
as much from all the damage.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.159
So why did it all
go south?

47:10.239 --> 47:13.440
He lied to me
and he misled me.

47:13.519 --> 47:16.239
He wasn't honest
about who he was

47:16.320 --> 47:18.800
or why he wanted
to be with me.

47:18.880 --> 47:22.559
And I don't ever want
to feel like that again.

47:22.639 --> 47:23.760
Sookie, if that's what--

47:23.840 --> 47:26.960
I'm not normally
this forward,

47:27.039 --> 47:30.079
but before I open
my heart up

47:30.159 --> 47:32.440
any more than
I already have,

47:32.519 --> 47:34.199
I need to ask you
a question.

47:34.280 --> 47:35.599
Anything.
Shoot.

47:36.639 --> 47:38.719
What is it

47:38.800 --> 47:40.840
about me

47:40.920 --> 47:42.800
that you want?

47:49.519 --> 47:51.480
Here's the thing.

47:55.159 --> 47:57.079
Everybody wants to be understood, right?
2

47:58.440 --> 48:00.320
When you found me
by the side of that road,

48:00.400 --> 48:02.000
I knew you understood me.

48:02.079 --> 48:04.719
I knew I understood you

48:04.800 --> 48:08.079
and I knew it
right away.

48:10.559 --> 48:13.079
Does this sound
crazy to you?

48:17.679 --> 48:20.119
Girl #1: Oh, can you
take us home now?

48:20.199 --> 48:21.519
You sure you don't
want to see a movie?

48:21.599 --> 48:23.440
We've got Wii.
Do you play Wii?

48:23.519 --> 48:26.119
Seriously, our father
is like an important sheriff.

48:26.199 --> 48:29.320
So if you don't let us all go, you're gonna be
in some crazy deep shit.

48:29.400 --> 48:31.400
Look, if it
were up to me,

48:31.480 --> 48:32.880
I'd totally take
y'all home right now,

48:32.960 --> 48:34.679
but my dad's checking on
some really important stuff

48:34.760 --> 48:36.920
and as soon as he's done,
you can go.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.360
Fuck that.

48:38.440 --> 48:41.159
He did that blood thing
to me and my sister.

48:41.239 --> 48:44.159
He's creepy. We're going now.
Come on.

48:44.239 --> 48:46.639
No, no, no, no.
Please. Please.

48:46.719 --> 48:48.519
Wait. Please.
If you all go, I am dead.

48:48.599 --> 48:49.840
That's your
fucking problem.

48:49.920 --> 48:51.960
- Let us go!
- Come on!

48:52.039 --> 48:56.800
No, seriously,
get the fuck away from me!

48:56.880 --> 49:00.000
You smell like honey.

49:00.079 --> 49:02.239
There's a Renard Parish
Sheriff's vehicle

49:02.320 --> 49:04.960
out here all night
and all the next day

49:05.039 --> 49:06.719
and you don't think
to report it?

49:06.800 --> 49:08.559
I don't get involved
in cop shit.

49:08.639 --> 49:10.800
Ain't it your job to keep
track of your own cars?

49:11.920 --> 49:13.039
And you don't
remember the face

49:13.119 --> 49:15.079
of anyone who came
in here last night?

49:15.159 --> 49:16.840
Shoot, we do
a crackin' trade.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.559
Maybe if you gave me
a description.

49:18.639 --> 49:21.719
Females, Caucasians,

49:21.800 --> 49:24.280
anywhere between
the age of 10 and 50.

49:24.360 --> 49:31.239
You two looking
for suspects or dates?

49:31.320 --> 49:33.159
- Police brutality.
- Shut up!

49:33.239 --> 49:35.000
Now you listen to me,

49:35.079 --> 49:37.800
my partner, he's been up
since the crack of dawn.

49:37.880 --> 49:39.760
But me,
I'm just getting started.

49:39.840 --> 49:41.400
So, fuck-knuckle,

49:41.480 --> 49:43.719
just give me an excuse
to blow off some steam.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.360
I swear, I don't
remember anything.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.440
- I have no idea how your police car got here.
- You fucking sure?

49:47.519 --> 49:49.719
Yes!

49:49.800 --> 49:52.519
- Not cool, man.

49:52.599 --> 49:54.719
Dang it.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.360
That was my best
Dirty Harry.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.360
He might
just be an idiot.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.599
Either that or...

50:01.679 --> 50:03.840
a vampire glamored him.

50:03.920 --> 50:06.440
Can vampires
sniff out faeries?

50:06.519 --> 50:07.920
Fuck, yeah.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.199
Faeries are like
catnip for vampires.

50:10.280 --> 50:12.360
Sookie's just got a little
bit of faerie in her

50:12.440 --> 50:13.800
and they go crazy.

50:17.079 --> 50:21.119
Andy, what's--

50:21.199 --> 50:23.159
What are you doing?

50:23.239 --> 50:25.519
- Andy!

50:30.639 --> 50:37.199
Oh, God.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.280
What have I done?

50:44.039 --> 50:46.159
I was so worried
it was gonna be you,

50:46.239 --> 50:49.039
but it was me.

50:49.119 --> 50:51.840
I did it.

50:51.920 --> 50:53.760
Just tell me
that they're not dead.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.079
Please, please tell me
they're not dead.

51:07.679 --> 51:09.760
Supper was delicious.
Thank you.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.400
You're welcome.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.360
You know,
it's a shame

51:13.440 --> 51:15.360
we didn't find a way into
each other's lives sooner.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.599
Is that what you think
you've done?

51:16.679 --> 51:17.960
Found your way
into my life?

51:18.039 --> 51:19.519
Haven't I?

51:19.599 --> 51:21.519
Well, you've passed
almost every test

51:21.599 --> 51:23.519
I've thrown
at you tonight.

51:23.599 --> 51:25.679
Oh, yeah? I didn't even know
I was being tested.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.360
What do I get
for passing?

51:28.400 --> 51:29.880
I didn't say there was--

51:29.960 --> 51:33.360
The skies above
are blue

51:36.639 --> 51:41.599
My heart was wrapped up
in clover

51:44.599 --> 51:48.360
The night
I looked at you

51:54.000 --> 52:02.679
I found a dream...

52:02.760 --> 52:04.719
- Okay.
- Hmm?

52:04.800 --> 52:07.480
- You can get off me now.
- What?

52:07.559 --> 52:10.360
Get the fuck off me
or die, Warlow.

52:10.440 --> 52:13.199
I found a thrill

52:13.280 --> 52:16.599
To press my cheek to

52:18.159 --> 52:21.360
A thrill that I

52:21.440 --> 52:24.119
Have never known

52:24.199 --> 52:25.920
Oh, yeah, yeah

52:26.000 --> 52:28.559
And you smile

52:28.639 --> 52:31.000
You smile

52:31.079 --> 52:35.960
Oh, and then
the spell was cast

52:39.760 --> 52:42.480
And here we are

52:42.559 --> 52:44.559
In heaven

52:47.639 --> 52:52.880
For you are mine

52:52.960 --> 52:56.480
At last.
