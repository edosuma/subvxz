00:01.210 --> 00:02.461
Hold on a minute.

00:02.544 --> 00:04.796
I'm very, very confused.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.924
Grandma knew Don Pablo?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.383
How?

00:08.467 --> 00:10.469
And what did they say
when they saw each other?

00:10.552 --> 00:12.304
You're not ready to hear that yet.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.682
Oh, my God. It's about sex, isn't it?

00:15.766 --> 00:18.352
-Did Grandma and Don Pablo smash?
-Hey, no!

00:18.435 --> 00:19.853
More respect.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.730
-It's my mom.
-Sorry. Sorry.

00:21.813 --> 00:24.650
You're not ready to hear
that yet because, first,

00:25.400 --> 00:27.653
there's a few things I need
to tell you about Don Pablo.

00:27.736 --> 00:31.073
Keep in mind, it took me years
to piece together the full story.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.950
And I already know this one.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.202
I'm gonna go help out
with Hugo's birthday dinner.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.204
I don't know what
culinary school Rolf went to,

00:37.287 --> 00:39.748
but his tacos de guisado are...

00:40.249 --> 00:41.333
Sorry, Rolf.

00:44.503 --> 00:47.923
That's actually the perfect segue.

00:48.507 --> 00:49.758
I felt sick.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.845
I had given away my best chance
to be with Julia.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.682
But as always,
Memo was there to cheer me up.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.686
Don't think about what you lost.
Focus on what you got.

01:01.103 --> 01:04.355
Your mom is getting her
eye surgery next week!

01:05.315 --> 01:08.151
You're right.
I shouldn't think about what I lost.

01:08.277 --> 01:11.238
Yeah, because it's brutal
what you went through.

01:11.363 --> 01:15.367
Chad got to take credit for your gift, and
now he seems like the perfect boyfriend.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.871
And from now on every single day at work
you'll have to see them,

01:19.121 --> 01:21.915
kissing, loving each other,

01:22.207 --> 01:24.001
staring into each other's eyes...

01:24.334 --> 01:27.212
Yeah, you do not want to think about that.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.756
Thanks for helping me not think
about it, Memo.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.135
Right now,
I just want to do my job, make money,

01:33.218 --> 01:34.678
and avoid Julia and Chad
as much as possible.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.680
-Hi, Julia. Hey, Chad.
-Hi, Máximo.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.307
This is gonna be tough.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.150
Welcome to our new photo exhibit of...

01:48.233 --> 01:50.861
Las Colinas through the decades.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.989
Before we start, feel free to get
any photos you might need.

01:58.035 --> 02:01.121
After the tour, we'll have
a small reception in the gallery.

02:01.205 --> 02:05.000
And before you ask, yes,
there will be free booze.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.836
Do I know reporters,
or do I know reporters?

02:12.758 --> 02:14.760
We'll start in just a moment.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.854
It was 1949.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.441
1949.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.070
So, like, when you started
working at Las Colinas?

02:33.153 --> 02:36.198
No, Hugo.
I'm not a hundred years old.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.742
But that was when Don Pablo

02:38.825 --> 02:41.745
started his journey at Las Colinas.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.039
Isn't it beautiful, Víctor?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.416
That's where your dad's gonna work.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.377
To be somebody someday!

02:48.544 --> 02:49.795
You already are somebody.

02:50.254 --> 02:50.879
Yeah,

02:51.213 --> 02:51.922
I'm Pablito,

02:52.506 --> 02:53.966
the straight-A student,

02:54.550 --> 02:56.093
who now changes tires for a living.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.177
You are Pablito,

02:57.719 --> 02:59.972
the hard-working father
who never gives up.

03:00.138 --> 03:00.931
Pablito,

03:01.682 --> 03:05.477
the one who married the smartest and
prettiest girl in the neighborhood.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.397
I'm going to give you everything you want,
mijito.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.526
And maybe, someday,
you'll work here with me.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.614
Hey! You're standing in the road!
Now move it!

03:20.492 --> 03:21.326
Kiss.

03:27.207 --> 03:27.916
You got this!

03:28.166 --> 03:29.751
You're going to do great!

03:32.546 --> 03:35.632
I really like your work,
so how about you come back on Monday?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.801
Thank you!
It will be my pleasure, Miss.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.142
Excuse me.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.060
I hope you had a nice flight from Europe.

03:47.144 --> 03:51.064
If you need help finding your luggage,
I have a friend who works at the airport.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.568
-How did you know I just--
-Your cigarettes are a European brand.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.112
Your watch is still seven hours ahead,

03:57.196 --> 03:59.448
which tells me you just got here.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.409
And no one would wear a wool suit
in this heat

04:02.492 --> 04:05.579
-if they had any choice.
-I'm impressed.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.998
Hey. Are you my next interview?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.209
Señor. Yes, sir. Pablo Bonilla.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.669
Oh God.
Another day, another moron.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.297
You are bothering the owner's wife.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.050
Actually, Don Antonio,
I think you should hire this man.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.928
Ms. Yvonne, hiring
the right people takes a lot of work.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.097
And yet firing people
can happen like that.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.683
Well, which is why I think he would make

04:26.767 --> 04:29.478
an excellent member of our staff.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.272
To your bright future here at Las Colinas.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.984
Congratulations, Pablo. You're hired.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.986
You fired Mónica?

04:38.070 --> 04:39.363
It had to be done.

04:39.446 --> 04:43.367
You fired our event coordinator
on the day of our big press event.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.577
As I said, it had to be done.

04:45.661 --> 04:49.081
I found out this morning
that she was leaking information

04:49.164 --> 04:52.042
about our guests to Espectacular magazine.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.919
God, I hate reporters.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.713
I'll be right there, my darlings!

04:56.797 --> 04:59.800
Don't worry.
The event will still be a success.

05:01.051 --> 05:04.888
And it will get us publicity
and attract the investors we need.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.557
You're right.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.350
Of course, you're always right.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.478
Do you smell fish?

05:12.062 --> 05:15.190
What they were about
to learn was that after getting fired,

05:15.774 --> 05:20.821
Mónica did three things to make sure
the event would be a complete disaster.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.367
Number one, she unplugged the fridge

05:25.450 --> 05:27.786
and ruined all the food for the event.

05:29.997 --> 05:34.293
Number two,
she made the entire room smell like fish.

05:34.877 --> 05:38.755
And number three,
she stained the rug with red wine.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.216
And not with the cheap stuff.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.852
The food's spoiled, the carpet's stained

05:51.935 --> 05:54.271
and it smells like a
whale's sphincter in here.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.400
I once did a series of promotional spots
for SeaWorld Orlando.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.278
It's too late for us to cancel.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.322
The reporters are already in the lobby.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.992
It's a 20-minute tour
and then we walk through those doors.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.203
-You have to fix this.
-Me?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.580
Yes. I need my best guy on this.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.209
Unfortunately, Don Pablo's
part of the tour, so you're all I've got.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.711
Okay. I know just what to do.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.047
You have to fix this, please.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.633
I don't know.
They really need me here at the pool.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.928
Oh, come on, man. You always help me out.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.014
Come on. You're my hermano, my amigo.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.974
You're my "hermigo."

06:31.058 --> 06:33.519
-Please, please, please, please.
-Okay, okay, Chad.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.229
But only because we're "hermigos."

06:36.772 --> 06:39.650
Ah, the '50s. What a time.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.237
Or so I've heard.
I wasn't born yet.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.991
Don Pablo, what was Las Colinas like
in the '50s?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.369
Well, Diane, that's a great question.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.872
It was a time of exciting changes.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.181
At 2:00 p.m. at the pool,
learn how to jitterbug.

07:11.974 --> 07:16.311
A poodle skirt?
Kids today have no class.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.439
Oh, that Elvis Presley
has ruined their generation.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.608
We're never coming back here again.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.320
Here you go. A Hudson on the rocks.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.865
Sorry, I mean bourbon on the rocks.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.324
Rock Hudson's my friend.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.870
We have to fix that
electrical problem in room 237.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.254
Mr. and Mrs. Davidson.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.341
I see here it's your first time
at Las Colinas.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.801
Enjoy your stay.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.052
Oh, we will.

07:51.263 --> 07:55.225
So, six crates of Dom Pérignon
just arrived out back.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.686
Put three of them
in the back seat of my car.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.605
I'm not sure I can do that.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.900
You're right. You're right.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.485
I just filled the back seat
with kitchen supplies.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.071
Put the champagne in the trunk.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.373
Pablo. Care to join me for a Scotch?

08:18.457 --> 08:21.418
I would love to, Mr. Davidson,
but I promised my wife that I w--

08:21.502 --> 08:23.837
Remember, we don't say no here.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.048
The guest gets what the guest wants.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.554
I'd be happy to grab a Scotch with you.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.523
Dad!

08:46.318 --> 08:47.861
Look what I drew!

08:48.862 --> 08:50.364
This is you,

08:50.572 --> 08:52.115
and this right here is

08:52.199 --> 08:53.325
Las Colinas!

08:53.408 --> 08:54.409
And this is me,

08:54.493 --> 08:55.911
working with you!

08:56.537 --> 08:57.621
I love it!

08:58.121 --> 09:00.249
I can't wait for you to grow up
so we can work together.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.128
This is for you.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.130
Thank you, Dad!

09:07.214 --> 09:08.215
You're welcome my boy!

09:16.014 --> 09:16.682
Hi honey.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.101
Nora.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.352
Wait.

09:20.435 --> 09:21.937
Did you just say something?

09:22.604 --> 09:24.064
I don't believe so.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.566
No, that was me.

09:25.649 --> 09:28.694
My abuela and Don Pablo
knew each other back in the '50s?

09:28.777 --> 09:30.654
It was confusing to me too.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.699
Like when you're trying to tell a story
and a kid keeps interrupting you.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.952
Do you know how hard it is
to keep all these timelines straight?

09:37.035 --> 09:38.120
Sorry.

09:38.203 --> 09:42.082
-And you're doing a great job, by the way.
-Oh. Thank you.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.501
Now, where was I?

09:46.336 --> 09:48.213
You shouldn't encourage your son

09:48.297 --> 09:49.631
to work at that resort.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.800
They fired my cousin last night.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.052
They said he was stealing.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.804
But he would never do that!

09:55.929 --> 09:58.056
I'm sure it was Don Antonio,
who then blamed it on him.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.267
He's constantly stealing from the resort,

10:00.559 --> 10:01.602
anything he can.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.147
What's he even gonna do
with a dozen room service menus?

10:05.355 --> 10:06.899
You can't keep working there, Pablo.

10:07.191 --> 10:10.444
But I'm doing this for us.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.363
Are you?
You're never home anymore.

10:13.447 --> 10:17.034
You care more about "being somebody"
to the hotel guests

10:17.534 --> 10:18.827
than to your own family.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.833
Okay.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.502
I'll quit.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.462
But first...

10:29.171 --> 10:31.507
...I have to make sure
Don Antonio doesn't ruin any more lives.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.427
What kind of example would I be setting
for Víctor if I did nothing?

10:35.928 --> 10:37.137
Your keys.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.972
Oh, this isn't my car.

10:40.349 --> 10:43.393
Get this car outta here
and pull up Yvonne's immediately!

10:43.477 --> 10:44.978
This is your car, Don Antonio.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.189
Why is all this resort property in there?

10:48.106 --> 10:49.566
Very mysterious.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.028
So that was the end of Don Antonio.

10:53.612 --> 10:54.988
Bye, Felicia.

10:55.072 --> 10:58.992
Did you hear me, Hugo?
I said, "Bye, Felicia."

10:59.076 --> 11:00.953
Yeah, nobody says that anymore.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.287
Whatever.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.747
Later that day,

11:03.830 --> 11:06.708
Pablo went to Yvonne to fulfill
his promise to his wife and resign.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.001
Okay, have a great night.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.337
Ms. Yvonne.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.421
Yes?

11:13.006 --> 11:16.385
Working here has been
an incredible opportunity to me--

11:16.468 --> 11:18.011
I know what you want to tell me, Pablo.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.429
And, yes, you've earned it.

11:19.513 --> 11:23.267
Congratulations on being
our new general manager.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.187
Little Pablito from Arenal Street

11:27.271 --> 11:29.898
had become Don Pablo.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.902
There was no way
he was quitting now.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.323
Excuse me, Don Pablo?

11:38.532 --> 11:38.991
Yes.

11:40.200 --> 11:40.909
I'm Lupe.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.245
I was just hired in the laundry room.

11:45.372 --> 11:49.376
Thank you for this job --
I'll always work very hard.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.712
Welcome, Lupe.

11:52.504 --> 11:56.383
I know that your time here
will transform you.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.266
Should we wake her up to ask
if it's okay that you come help me out?

12:04.391 --> 12:08.020
Her naps usually last three to five hours,
so I think we're good.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.986
There you are,
you foul-smelling son of a bitch.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.405
Nice to see you too,
you fluffy-haired brat.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.659
Oh. I was also talking to the fish.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.204
Okay, that's one problem solved.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.456
Next, the food you lost.
Can the kitchen replace it?

12:27.539 --> 12:29.249
No. They're in between shifts.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.376
The food carts by the employee entrance.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.378
Go ask them to come set up in here.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.172
Wait, how do I do that in Spanish?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.716
Speak to them in the universal language.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.513
"Vánemos, vánemos, vánemos."

12:44.556 --> 12:46.975
Why does this money smell like fish?

12:47.392 --> 12:48.227
Last problem.

12:48.727 --> 12:49.353
The stain.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.104
It's red wine.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.106
These stains are impossible to remove.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.399
The are almost worse than molé.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.152
My mom's tablecloth
has so many molé stains

12:57.236 --> 12:58.987
people just think it's a cool pattern.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.865
Memo, you just solved the problem.

13:02.324 --> 13:02.950
You're right.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.701
We need my mom's tablecloth!

13:04.785 --> 13:06.620
No dude. We need more wine.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.457
Ah, the '60s.

13:10.541 --> 13:14.503
So many memories and blackouts.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.381
Don Pablo, what was it like here?

13:18.423 --> 13:21.426
Well, that's another
great question, Diane.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.555
It was a time of exciting changes.

13:37.776 --> 13:41.697
And at 2:00 p.m. by the pool,
learn how to do the twist.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.366
It's very popular right now.

13:45.576 --> 13:49.246
A bikini? Oh, kids today have no class.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.165
The Beatles have
ruined their generation.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.668
We're never coming back here again.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.754
Here you are. Two Dean martinis.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.591
Sorry, I mean dry martinis.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.259
Dean Martin is my friend.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.346
We have to fix
that water leak in room 237.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.856
Mr. and Mrs. Davidson.

14:16.607 --> 14:19.193
I see here it's your first time
at Las Colinas.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.612
Enjoy your stay.

14:22.196 --> 14:23.655
Oh, we will.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.910
Join me later for our traditional Scotch?

14:28.577 --> 14:31.496
The guest gets what
the guest wants, Mr. Davidson.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.540
To Don Pablo.

14:34.499 --> 14:39.838
To Don Pablo!

14:44.676 --> 14:45.802
Hi honey.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.185
I know I'm late, but...

14:54.186 --> 14:56.980
Some guests asked me to stay.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.034
What's this?

15:16.208 --> 15:17.292
Dear Víctor,

15:18.794 --> 15:22.422
I'm sorry that I can no longer
live with you and your mother.

15:24.383 --> 15:27.094
She only sees the resort as evil,

15:27.177 --> 15:31.515
not as a way to make our lives better.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.729
But please know that
everything I do is for your future.

15:38.689 --> 15:42.693
And someday you'll work here with me,
mijito.

15:56.290 --> 15:57.833
Smell that vino.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.544
It's like Chevy Chase's
bachelor party all over again.

16:01.712 --> 16:05.591
Celebrities have long come here to escape
the hustle and bustle of Hollywood.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.759
John Wayne, Ava Gardner,

16:07.843 --> 16:11.597
and a little old
Daytime Emmy Award nominee,

16:11.680 --> 16:13.682
Diane Davies.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.564
Chad! Get back here!

16:20.647 --> 16:23.734
Chad. Chad!

16:23.817 --> 16:25.194
Chad!

16:25.277 --> 16:26.695
Sorry about my son.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.907
I said be careful, but sometimes
he forgets what I tell him to do.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.533
Oh, where are my manners?

16:31.617 --> 16:32.701
Diane Davies.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.119
Pablo Bonilla.

16:35.579 --> 16:36.622
I'm a big fan.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.582
Then you know how glad I am to be here.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.834
We just had to get out of LA
for a little while.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.337
The tabloids were so vicious about me,

16:43.420 --> 16:45.088
about Chad, digging into my past.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.799
I really didn't know where to go.
So I just jumped on a plane and--

16:47.883 --> 16:48.884
You're safe here.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.138
Thank you.

16:53.222 --> 16:54.765
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:55.265 --> 16:58.352
I'm expecting my own son later on
for New Year's Eve.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.855
I'm surprising him with a job offer here.

17:01.939 --> 17:05.400
Running this resort with your son?
How intriguing.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.777
Yes.

17:08.237 --> 17:09.780
Damn that kid. Chad!

17:10.781 --> 17:13.116
Chad, get back here now!

17:13.200 --> 17:16.618
That evening,
Don Pablo waited for his son Víctor

17:16.703 --> 17:19.248
to finally join him at Las Colinas.

17:19.329 --> 17:23.335
Don Pablo, a certain head
of state is losing at poker

17:23.416 --> 17:26.338
and wants you to stop by
because you always bring him luck.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.883
My son will be here soon.

17:33.387 --> 17:36.807
Well, the guest gets what the guest wants.

17:38.934 --> 17:40.143
Just one hand.

17:43.272 --> 17:45.065
But for Don Pablo,

17:45.148 --> 17:47.860
it was never just one hand.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.628
I'm tired of waiting for you.
--Víctor

18:19.141 --> 18:20.017
Nora, good morning.

18:20.309 --> 18:21.226
Pablo.

18:22.394 --> 18:25.355
Víctor hasn't spoken to me
since I missed him at New Year's.

18:26.023 --> 18:28.358
I just went to the house, and it's empty.
Do you know what happened?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.236
He went with his mother to Mexico City.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.531
But I want him to work with me
at Las Colinas.

18:35.866 --> 18:38.535
You think Víctor wants to work there,

18:39.036 --> 18:40.370
after what it's done to your family?

18:41.330 --> 18:41.830
To you?

18:44.583 --> 18:45.042
Pablo,

18:46.710 --> 18:48.795
it made you forget about your own son
that night.

18:50.714 --> 18:53.175
Now, he said,
it's time for him to forget about you.

18:53.675 --> 18:54.468
I'm sorry.

18:57.471 --> 18:58.972
From then on,

18:59.056 --> 19:03.852
Don Pablo would sit at his table nearly
every night in penance for what he'd done.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.855
But also hoping that someday

19:07.356 --> 19:10.984
his son might change his mind
and come back to him.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.198
Meanwhile, Nora never forgave Don Pablo

19:16.281 --> 19:18.158
for driving away his own family...

19:18.867 --> 19:21.453
nor Las Colinas for turning him

19:21.537 --> 19:24.122
into the type of man who could do that.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.378
Why are you crying?

19:29.461 --> 19:31.213
I squirted lemon in my eye.

19:32.631 --> 19:35.008
We did it, right? Everything looks good.

19:37.511 --> 19:42.349
"Vánemos, vánemos, vánemos."
Sí, "vánemos". Yes. Sí.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.518
We'd solved all three problems.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.145
So, everything was now--
No, no, wait. Wait. Wait.

19:47.646 --> 19:49.189
There was a fourth problem.

19:52.067 --> 19:56.280
And this one was more horrible
than all the other three combined.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.253
Who did this to my mom?

20:18.969 --> 20:20.804
Googly eyes always make me laugh.

20:20.888 --> 20:21.889
What are we gonna do?

20:21.972 --> 20:23.891
This photo is the finale
for the whole tour.

20:23.974 --> 20:26.226
Wait. I know who can help us.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.355
What do we think?

20:30.439 --> 20:32.399
-I think it works.
-That totally works.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.904
I'm sorry.
I'm still thinking about googly eyes.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.452
And here we are in the '80s.

20:43.535 --> 20:46.205
Acapulco's new golden age,

20:46.288 --> 20:48.248
which makes me its golden girl.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.918
Although the salon called it honey-ginger.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.295
Don Pablo, 1981.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.215
Love this question, Diane.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.176
It was a time of exciting changes.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.444
-So, you work for Espectacular?
-Yeah, two years now.

21:17.528 --> 21:19.112
Maybe we can help each other out.

21:19.196 --> 21:20.364
I'm sure we can.

21:21.323 --> 21:24.910
Ripped T-shirts?
Kids today have no class.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.579
Second-wave British
anarchist punk movement

21:27.663 --> 21:29.498
has ruined this generation.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.667
-Yeah, we're never coming back here again.
-No.

21:33.252 --> 21:35.337
Yeah, here we go. Two Phil Collins.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.673
I mean Tom Collins.

21:37.756 --> 21:39.383
Phil Collins is a friend of mine.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.134
Also Joan Collins.

21:41.552 --> 21:43.887
A guest died in room 237 last night.

21:43.971 --> 21:45.764
He got electrocuted
after stepping in a puddle.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.731
Mr. and Mrs. Davidson.

21:54.815 --> 21:57.568
I see here it's your first time
at Las Colinas.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.653
Enjoy your stay.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.989
Oh, we will.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.623
Thank you, boys. Thank you.

22:11.707 --> 22:13.625
Chad, be useful and check us in.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.796
-Hi.
-Welcome to Las Colinas.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.299
May I have the first and last name
on your reservation, please?

22:20.382 --> 22:22.676
Sure. It's, uh, Diane...

22:26.180 --> 22:27.264
Davies.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.432
-Davies.
-Wow.

22:29.141 --> 22:30.809
For a second there,
I almost forgot my last name.

22:33.061 --> 22:36.023
-Don Pablo.
-Miss Davies.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.650
It's always good to see you.

22:38.734 --> 22:41.320
It's always good to be back.
You know how much I love it here.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.655
It's such a shame that...

22:44.323 --> 22:45.866
well, I shouldn't--

22:45.949 --> 22:47.409
What? You can tell me.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.622
The owner passed away.

22:51.705 --> 22:55.000
And his widow has been meeting
with the large hotel chains.

22:55.083 --> 22:59.963
By next year, Las Colinas
could be just a corporate hotel.

23:00.047 --> 23:01.882
No. That's criminal.

23:01.965 --> 23:04.176
Whoever buys this
has to keep it just the way it is.

23:04.259 --> 23:07.179
If only this person
could be you.

23:07.262 --> 23:11.058
Well, Glutes of Gold 3
has been selling through the roof.

23:11.141 --> 23:12.768
Maybe I should make an offer.

23:14.144 --> 23:16.939
Of course, I couldn't compete
with the Sheratons and the Hiltons.

23:18.232 --> 23:20.234
-Could I?
-You never know.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.403
Why not try and see what happens?

23:28.242 --> 23:30.077
Can you serve it to us
by the pool?

23:30.160 --> 23:31.995
-Whenever you'd like.
-Don Pablo.

23:33.705 --> 23:36.416
The larger chains withdrew their offers.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.086
Someone told them Las Colinas
is sinking into the ground.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.587
Isn't that strange?

23:40.671 --> 23:41.797
Very mysterious.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.591
So now, I have to sell to your friend
with the shoulder pads.

23:44.675 --> 23:46.176
What do you think about that?

23:46.885 --> 23:50.389
Well, I think the guest got
what the guest wanted.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.352
Thank you for everything, Yvonne.

23:56.311 --> 23:58.397
-Thank you.
-Adieu, Pablo.

24:16.665 --> 24:21.461
In fact, it's thanks to Don Pablo
that I came to own Las Colinas.

24:22.212 --> 24:24.214
So if anything, he's to blame.

24:25.757 --> 24:29.469
And now, the centerpiece of our exhibit.

24:29.553 --> 24:32.097
Don Pablo, if you please.

24:32.598 --> 24:34.016
You might want these.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.310
-Why?
-Trust me. You'll see.

25:07.925 --> 25:09.676
Nice touch-up job.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.428
Once again, you've impressed.

25:11.512 --> 25:13.430
Maybe I should press my luck then.

25:13.514 --> 25:15.724
I think my dresses will make
an excellent addition

25:15.807 --> 25:17.059
to the resort's gift shop.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.062
I would love to meet with you
sometime to discuss my plan.

25:20.145 --> 25:21.146
How's next week?

25:21.230 --> 25:23.524
All this and moxie too.

25:24.149 --> 25:25.859
All right, let's get it on the books.

25:31.907 --> 25:32.824
Nice recovery.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.118
I don't know what you mean.

25:35.786 --> 25:36.870
Monica told me what she did.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.331
I'm the editor of Espectacular.

25:39.957 --> 25:43.502
Now that she's gone...
I could use a new partner here.

25:44.127 --> 25:45.087
I would never do that.

25:45.462 --> 25:46.463
Never say never.

25:49.049 --> 25:50.300
In case you have a change of heart...

25:54.596 --> 25:57.099
I helped save
Las Colinas from disaster.

25:58.183 --> 26:02.104
I had come a long way
since my first day at the resort.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.648
Please call me, Víctor.

26:05.607 --> 26:06.358
Or come visit.

26:07.401 --> 26:08.318
You know how to find me.

26:18.662 --> 26:19.997
Excuse me, Don Pablo?

26:20.622 --> 26:23.166
We speak English here.
How can I help you?

26:23.250 --> 26:24.543
My name is Máximo.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.587
I'm interviewing for a job at the resort.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.338
Interviews are over there.

26:29.256 --> 26:31.383
I understand. It's just...

26:32.885 --> 26:35.888
I grew up on Arenal Street just like you.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.892
What did you say your name was?

26:39.975 --> 26:42.477
Máximo Gallardo Ramos, sir.

26:46.190 --> 26:47.274
Nora Ramos.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.860
It's been a very long time.

26:50.277 --> 26:50.944
Yes it has.

26:51.737 --> 26:52.237
A long time.

26:53.447 --> 26:57.242
At least now,
I can congratulate you in person.

26:57.951 --> 26:59.036
Congratulate me for what?

26:59.203 --> 27:00.454
For becoming a grandfather!

27:06.960 --> 27:07.961
Forgive me.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.005
Forgive me. I thought you knew.

27:10.422 --> 27:11.340
How careless of me.

27:13.133 --> 27:13.800
No, no...

27:14.718 --> 27:16.803
Don't worry. That is great news.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.597
It sure is!

27:22.601 --> 27:23.769
And... what's his name?

27:25.437 --> 27:29.733
Mariano.

27:30.192 --> 27:31.318
Mariano?

27:32.569 --> 27:35.239
Is he the one who sent you the letter?

27:35.739 --> 27:36.865
Yes, Hugo.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.869
He was writing to let me know
that his grandfather,

27:40.953 --> 27:43.622
Don Pablo, has passed away.

27:44.122 --> 27:47.209
Máximo. I am so sorry to hear that.

27:47.876 --> 27:48.877
It's okay.

27:48.961 --> 27:51.380
Is that why you're
telling me this story today?

27:51.964 --> 27:52.965
Yeah.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.302
They're having a memorial service.

27:58.345 --> 27:59.847
A celebration of Don Pablo's life.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.019
Mariano was asking me to speak at it.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.106
You gotta go, right?

28:12.025 --> 28:14.152
You know, your uncle didn't leave

28:14.236 --> 28:16.947
on the best terms
with everyone at Las Colinas.

28:17.948 --> 28:20.701
I'm sure this is not
an easy decision for him.

28:20.784 --> 28:22.035
No.

28:24.580 --> 28:27.374
Still, I owe a lot to Don Pablo.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.586
I never would have become
the person I am today

28:31.628 --> 28:33.714
had he not taken me under his wing.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.174
You wanted to see me?

28:35.257 --> 28:37.885
-You did a good job today.
-Thank you.

28:38.594 --> 28:41.096
We're going to be making
some changes to the staff.

28:41.180 --> 28:42.639
You are?

28:42.764 --> 28:46.310
The pool manager will be promoted
to Monica's position,

28:46.894 --> 28:49.563
which means we will need
a replacement for his position,

28:50.564 --> 28:53.275
and I think you'd be perfect for the role.

28:54.985 --> 28:55.903
Really?!

28:56.069 --> 28:57.029
It will be more money,

28:57.112 --> 28:58.739
and more responsibilities.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.949
It's not official yet, but...

29:01.575 --> 29:04.870
next week, when you're back
from your mother's eye surgery,

29:05.495 --> 29:07.372
I'll make sure you get it.

29:08.123 --> 29:09.166
Thank you, Don Pablo.

29:09.958 --> 29:13.086
You have no idea how much this
means to me and my family.

29:17.508 --> 29:21.220
Would you like to sit
and have a drink with me?

29:49.957 --> 29:52.960
To your bright future
here at Las Colinas.

30:00.300 --> 30:03.595
To Don Pablo.
