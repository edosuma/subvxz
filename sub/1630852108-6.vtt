00:57.724 --> 00:58.808
-Sorry, Mama.
-Okay.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.986

I was very upset when your mom told me
what you did at the cemetery last night.

03:56.819 --> 04:01.157
Witchcraft is a sin, and witches are evil.

God tells us that

04:07.330 --> 04:08.498
You understand?

04:08.581 --> 04:09.666
I guess.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.334
This is the Christmas season.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.753
Your thoughts should be of the Baby Jesus,

04:13.836 --> 04:18.341
who came to Earth to save us from sin
by dying on the cross.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.510
So, um, Christmas is about death?

04:20.593 --> 04:23.012
No, that's Easter.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.640
Actually, that's about torture and murder,

04:25.723 --> 04:28.142
which is why we add the bunny
and the chocolate eggs.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.394
It takes the edge off.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.355
And we remember
Jesus's sacrifice on the cross

04:32.438 --> 04:35.316
by consuming his body and blood
in Holy Communion.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.859
You drink blood?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.362
Oh, that's just wine
that we get at a discount.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.197
It's not really blood.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.907
[man] Yes, it is!

04:42.991 --> 04:44.701
Well, not really.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.621
At every mass,
you say it's the blood of Christ!

04:48.705 --> 04:50.373
It's a metaphor, numbnuts!

04:50.456 --> 04:54.294
Wine becomes the blood of Christ
through transubstantiation!

04:54.377 --> 04:55.962
That doesn't make sense.

04:56.045 --> 04:59.257
It's not supposed to make sense.
It's religion!

04:59.340 --> 05:01.217
You have to trust what the priest says!

05:01.301 --> 05:05.305
Like when Father Brown told me he was
just adjusting my robes every Sunday.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.308
Uh, Father Brown has been transferred
to Albuquerque.

05:08.391 --> 05:13.771
We felt, in a less populated state,
it might help curb some of his cravings.

05:13.855 --> 05:18.609
[clears throat] So, Maureen, let's
get back to the miracle of Jesus' birth.

05:18.693 --> 05:22.905
Are we just gonna blow past the fact
that it's not really Christ's blood?

05:22.989 --> 05:25.366
That's one of the foundations
of our church!

05:25.450 --> 05:27.076
Like how Jesus was born

05:27.160 --> 05:30.204
by the Immaculate Conception
of Mary Magdalene.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.372
You mean just Mary.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.374
That's what I said, Mary Magdalene.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.252
No! Jesus's mom was Virgin Mary.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.465
Mary Magdalene could get dicked down
whenever she wanted. Right, Father?

05:41.049 --> 05:44.802
Well, minus the salty language, yes.

05:44.886 --> 05:48.848
But the Immaculate Conception
is about Mary being born without sin,

05:48.931 --> 05:51.642
not conceiving Jesus
through the Holy Spirit

05:51.726 --> 05:53.144
while remaining a virgin.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.521
Well, where in the sam hill
does it say that?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.231
Oh, it's simple!

05:58.024 --> 06:00.151
God is the father of us all.

06:00.234 --> 06:04.572
So he's Mary's father,
and he's also the father of Jesus.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.700
And Jesus is part of the Holy Trinity,

06:07.784 --> 06:11.037
which means that he's God and God's son!

06:11.120 --> 06:13.456
So Jesus had sex with himself?

06:13.539 --> 06:15.792
Nobody fornicated with anybody!

06:15.875 --> 06:20.171
God impregnated Mary, spiritually,
and he's also her father.

06:20.254 --> 06:24.801
And her son, Jesus, is also her father
and his own father.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.303
That sounds like the plot of Chinatown.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.640
It is not Chinatown. It is beautiful!

06:30.723 --> 06:32.392
Pull your dress down!

06:33.351 --> 06:34.268
[clears throat]

06:34.352 --> 06:37.563
The important thing is,
however it happened,

06:37.647 --> 06:40.817
Jesus was born our savior
on Christmas Day.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.152
I read that he was actually born in April.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.987
-You shut your mouth!
-He was not!

06:45.071 --> 06:46.406
[nun] Devil child!

06:46.489 --> 06:48.533

06:48.616 --> 06:51.160

06:51.953 --> 06:54.956
And I just thought,
if I could talk to my grandpa's ghost,

06:55.039 --> 07:00.044
my daddy would be happy, and I wouldn't
have to be co-princess anymore.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.673

07:03.756 --> 07:06.968
There, there. Neither does Marty Allen.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.220
Oh, sweetheart.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.305
Father Pat, what happened in here?

07:11.389 --> 07:12.890
Oh, I'll tell you what happened.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.101
The Catholic Church, as always,

07:15.184 --> 07:18.229
is being raked
over the coals for hypocrisy.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.815
And yet, no one questions the moon landing

07:20.898 --> 07:23.776
'cause it was Jack's dream
and it was Camelot.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.654
And meanwhile, that weak-backed bastard

07:26.737 --> 07:29.073
was banging every whore he could find
in the fucking pool,

07:29.157 --> 07:31.200
and nobody questions that!

07:34.328 --> 07:36.164
Oh, who gives a shit?

07:36.247 --> 07:37.874
I'm going for a walk.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.834

07:39.917 --> 07:43.004
I feel better, Mommy. Can we go home now?

I don't think we can stay here.

Well, how long did that guy have
to have sex with that hole in the wall

10:38.679 --> 10:39.639
Okay.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.601
-So, can we go home now?
-That's what we're doing.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.395
Then why did we just drive past
our street again?

10:46.979 --> 10:47.855
[groans]

10:48.898 --> 10:50.358
[Frank] Well, none of this
would've happened

10:50.441 --> 10:52.610
if you were watching the kids
and not hanging out at Vic's.

10:52.693 --> 10:56.656
What is it about being in this house
that makes you want to leave so much?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.450
Because I'll tell you, Sue...
[scoffs] ...it's a mystery to me!

10:59.533 --> 11:02.244
You're the one who disappeared
so you could drive around town

11:02.328 --> 11:04.997
trying to find where some stupid key fits.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.165
It's not stupid.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.877
It's an inanimate object,
and it happens to mean a lot to me.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.297
And for your own edification,
I didn't find where it goes.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.924
-I'm done with that.
-Good.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.468
First thing tomorrow,
I'm taking Bill back down to the station

11:17.551 --> 11:19.303
to give those cops a piece of my mind.

11:19.387 --> 11:23.349
And then I think it's high time
you gave Bill the sex talk.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.768
Uh, well,
I don't know if that's necessary.

11:25.851 --> 11:30.106
Frank! That movie he saw tonight
could scar him for life.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.109
He needs to know
that is not what sex is really about.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.027
Does he?

11:35.111 --> 11:37.530
I don't know why
you're making such a big deal about it.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.448
Just tell him what you told Kevin.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.284
Yeah, uh, the words I said...

11:42.368 --> 11:44.829
You never told Kevin
about the birds and the bees?

11:44.912 --> 11:47.957
I was too busy
putting a roof over his head, Susan!

11:48.958 --> 11:51.502
Ah, Christ. I don't know what to say.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.880
It can't be that hard.
How did your father tell you?

11:54.964 --> 11:57.341
Women are the devil,
don't ever touch yourself,

11:57.425 --> 12:00.386
and now quit bugging me
and hand me that fucking monkey wrench

12:00.469 --> 12:01.971
before I hit you with it.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.764
That's healthy.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.976
This is your responsibility.
You're his father.

12:07.059 --> 12:10.604
-And I'm a damn good father!
-So don't let him down.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.609
-Dad, are you having a heart attack?
-I wish.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.236
[sighs]

12:17.319 --> 12:19.363
Christ. Here we go.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.120
[sighs]

12:26.203 --> 12:27.079
[engine sputters]

12:30.291 --> 12:31.500
Ah.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.585
So...

12:33.461 --> 12:34.462
Uh...

12:35.337 --> 12:38.799
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about, Bill.

12:38.883 --> 12:39.842
William.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.010
Remember a few years back

12:41.093 --> 12:43.345
when you asked me
what those dogs were doing,

12:43.429 --> 12:45.890
and I said one was giving the other
a piggyback ride?

12:45.973 --> 12:47.141
No.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.268
Okay, uh, how about when we went downtown

12:49.351 --> 12:52.563
and you saw those two hippies
"wrestling" in the park?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.273
What are you talking about?

12:54.356 --> 12:56.275
Okay, look.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.402
When people grow up... [sighs]

12:58.486 --> 13:01.030
...their... their... their body
wants to do some things.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.698
Like... like the way it wants to eat.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.992
You know, and there's nothing wrong
with being hungry.

13:05.075 --> 13:09.955
It's completely natural for your body
to tell you it wants to eat.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.957
And as you get older,

13:12.041 --> 13:15.169
you know, you're going to want
to eat a lot and at different times.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.546
You know, uh, in the shower,

13:18.422 --> 13:21.008
when you wake up sleeping on your stomach,

13:21.091 --> 13:23.260
when you see a billboard
for suntan lotion.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.055
-Uh, I'm not hungry.
-The hunger's just a metaphor!

13:26.138 --> 13:28.974
-A metaphor for what?
-I don't know anymore!

13:29.058 --> 13:31.560
[exhales]
Look, just give me a minute, will you?

13:33.187 --> 13:36.816
The vagina is, uh... is... No. Uh...

13:37.441 --> 13:41.403
Uh, uh, a woman's tulip is... is... is...

13:41.487 --> 13:43.781
Don't worry if you can't find it.
No guy's ever found it.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.533
Christ, it's... it's buried in there.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.955
Do you get it?

13:51.038 --> 13:54.458
A guy thing in a girl place
at the same time.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.795
And eventually, you see...
you see that little opening on the straw?

13:58.504 --> 14:01.298
Ah, Christ, just... just take
your dick out and figure it out!

14:01.382 --> 14:04.802
Dad, it's okay. You don't have to do this.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.096
Yes, I do. I'm your father and--

14:07.179 --> 14:10.182
No, really.
I know this is making you nervous.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.602
You don't have to tell me all this stuff.
I already know it.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.603
No, you don't.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.940
That movie is not what real people do.
Real people do what this straw and lid do.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.859
-No, I know that.
-How do you know?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.569
I just know, okay?

14:21.652 --> 14:25.406
I've seen people doing it. Up close.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.783
-The hell are you talking about?
-Nothing!

14:27.867 --> 14:30.661
Nah, don't "nothing" me!
Come on, out with it!

14:30.744 --> 14:33.664
-Ah, just forget about it!
-Tell me!

14:33.747 --> 14:35.499
[groans]

14:35.583 --> 14:39.336
That night last year
when I puked all over the table?

14:39.420 --> 14:43.382
I puked because I was hiding under the bed
when you and Mom were...

14:46.135 --> 14:47.261
[Frank] No!

14:48.262 --> 14:53.267
Oh, Jesus Christ! No!

14:57.813 --> 15:02.151
I don't care what you do
for the rest of your life

15:02.860 --> 15:06.071
as long as you never speak a word of this
to your mother.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.449
Okay? That woman's already half dead
from you kids.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.160
And this... this would put her
in the ground, you hear me?

15:11.243 --> 15:12.620
Okay.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.330
Can I still be a cop?

15:14.413 --> 15:17.625
Only if you promise to arrest me
and put me on death row.

15:22.296 --> 15:26.467
Hurry up! All my Kit Kats
is melting into Shit Kats.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.426
[grunts]

15:28.844 --> 15:31.347
Smokey, remember
I met you in September when--

15:31.430 --> 15:34.850
You will call me Black God.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.477
Yes, Black God.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.063
And I shall call you Larry.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.065
[chimes]

15:43.567 --> 15:44.860
So, where's Nuber?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.153
Oh, you mean Larry?

15:46.236 --> 15:49.365
Yeah, he decided to leave old Smokey
and go back to school

15:49.448 --> 15:52.076
where they filling his head
with all that book knowledge.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.495
Libraries are
for washing your socks in the sink!

15:54.578 --> 15:57.414
So what's this I hear
about you spending all your time

15:57.498 --> 15:59.541
crying over some mediocre white woman?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.293
Her name's Alice, and--

16:01.377 --> 16:05.255
Shut the fuck up!
That was rhetorical, motherfucker!

16:05.339 --> 16:08.676
You Murphys always coming to me
with your bullshit problem.

16:08.759 --> 16:12.471
"My daddy died and left me a mystery key."

16:12.554 --> 16:14.723
"Some girl dumped my ass."

16:14.807 --> 16:18.018
"Amy got the lead role
in the school play."

16:18.602 --> 16:21.563
You don't know jack shit
about real problems!

16:21.647 --> 16:26.276
As of this morning,
I got $14 to my name, in change.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.823
Got a cricket living in my ear,
and I'm about to lose my foot.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.993
Not 'cause of diabetes.
'Cause of gambling.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.204
Joke's on them though.
It's been dead for years,

16:37.287 --> 16:38.539
'cause of diabetes.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.959
So don't talk to me
about your fucking problems! That clear?

16:42.042 --> 16:43.669
Yes, Black God.

16:43.752 --> 16:47.214
You got too much time on your hands
to be thinking about all your shit.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.549
That ends today.

16:48.632 --> 16:52.636
Now, over the next nine hours
and one unpaid pee stop,

16:52.720 --> 16:54.054
I will break you.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.223
When you're loading 10,000 stale gumballs,

16:56.306 --> 16:58.559
you won't have time
to be thinking about no girl!

17:00.644 --> 17:03.647
I don't know.
She was the most perfect girl ever.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.900
She made me feel happy. She liked my vest.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.945
She inspired my greatest music ever.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.322
I wrote a song about it.

17:13.532 --> 17:17.828
♪ Alice, there's a thousand reasons why ♪

17:17.911 --> 17:20.748

17:49.943 --> 17:52.321
This world ain't nothing but pain!

17:52.404 --> 17:54.740
No one should have to suffer this life!

for your kids could be so exhausting?

18:14.551 --> 18:18.388
[sighs] I don't know what to do, Frank.
I... What are you doing?

18:18.472 --> 18:21.100
-Nothing. Just, uh, the bed.
-[Sue] What about it?

18:21.183 --> 18:25.354
It's... saggy. Maybe we should
stuff some luggage under here.

18:25.437 --> 18:29.149
Barbed wire, a bear trap.
Something to take up all the space.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.151
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.403
-Fucking kids are doing me in.
-[sighs]

18:33.487 --> 18:36.949
-Frank, they're becoming people.
-Yeah, and I don't like it.

18:37.032 --> 18:40.160
-So, what do we do now?
-We could both start drinking more.

18:40.244 --> 18:44.957
Seriously, Frank. I am at my wit's end.
What do we do?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.250
I don't know.

18:46.333 --> 18:50.546
Christ, we've given them to the church,
the police, a screaming Black guy.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.131
I mean, we've done everything we could.

18:53.257 --> 18:57.803
We could do something... nice?

18:57.886 --> 19:01.265
-They'll think they got away with it.
-Frank. They did.

19:02.933 --> 19:03.851
[chimes]

19:08.230 --> 19:09.565
Aw, shit.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.567
Fucking bowling.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.943
Not bad.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.028
Okay, let's see how everyone did.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.197
Sue, you got a 142.

19:17.281 --> 19:21.493
Dad, a solid 228. Thank you very much.

19:22.286 --> 19:25.164
Bill, 60. Maureen, 61.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.123
Kevin,

19:26.915 --> 19:27.749
zero.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.587
[chuckles] Hey, you tied
with Grandpa Bill, and he's dead.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.631
[chuckles] I've seen
blind people with no arms do better.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.467
Yeah, well, they're
not emotionally suffering like I am!

19:37.551 --> 19:38.594
-Ooh!
-Oh, Alice!

19:38.677 --> 19:41.013
-Kevin doesn't have a girlfriend!
-Please touch my wing-wang.

19:41.096 --> 19:41.930
-Shut up!
-[mocking]

19:42.014 --> 19:46.351
Okay, okay, leave Kevin alone, you two.
He's in pain, all right?

19:46.435 --> 19:48.770
And you're his fucking family,
so act like it!

19:50.606 --> 19:53.108
All right, time for a new game!
Lead us off, Maureen!

19:53.192 --> 19:55.903
[groans] Can I go play
in the game room instead?

19:55.986 --> 19:58.488
Me too?
They have that cool new video game.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.490
Fine. Here.

20:00.574 --> 20:04.453
Glad I shelled out a buck-fifty
renting you shoes to wear in the arcade.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.372
I'll go with them to make sure
they don't break any more laws.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.875
All right! [laughs]

20:09.958 --> 20:12.544
-Thanks for sticking up for me back there.
-I'm your father.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.714
Yeah, well, thanks.
Do I still have to bowl?

20:15.797 --> 20:19.301
Yep. Now let's see
if we can beat your high score of zero.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.930
Uh, you need to take the condoms
out of the machine?

20:23.013 --> 20:27.768
Uh, yeah, might be something wrong
with them, for some reason.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.604
Hey! You buy any of them rubbers in there?

20:30.687 --> 20:32.439
Give them back! You don't want them!

20:32.522 --> 20:35.275

-That's all I hear!

-Does that count for anything?
-You just lost me a hundred bucks!

Sorry, buddy!
First-time bowler, long-time idiot.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.038
[chuckles] Won't happen again.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.289
Pfft, thanks a lot.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.958
I just saved your life.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.918
You need a heavier ball. Hang on.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.297
[emotional music playing]

21:01.802 --> 21:04.596
Use this one. Bet it's got a strike in it.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.267
This ball, it actually came from, uh--

21:08.350 --> 21:10.602
Yeah, that rack.
There's a shitload of them.

Hey, I got one! I got the little one
in the corner! The pinky pin!

21:18.527 --> 21:20.654
Yeah, you did! Way to go, buddy.

21:20.737 --> 21:24.741
Knocking just one over is probably harder
than knocking them all over, right, Dad?

21:24.825 --> 21:26.868
Well, sure.

-What is the point of this game?
-You make dots.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.834
-It's amazing!
-Shh! I'm trying to concentrate!

21:33.917 --> 21:35.669
I got a free dot!

21:35.752 --> 21:37.963
Whoa, she's making so many dots!

21:38.046 --> 21:40.841
The future is a fucking miracle,
I tell you.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.759
My kid's going to eat that up.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.638
I guess it's pretty good
when you get them all down.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.974
Yeah. Who says you're not good at math?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.980
-What?
-Nothing. Nothing.

21:55.063 --> 21:59.318
Listen, uh...
So, how you doing? How's Kevin?

21:59.401 --> 22:01.862
Dad. [sighs] Every time
we try to have a talk like this,

22:01.945 --> 22:03.739
we just end up getting in a fight.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.867
I know we do.
But that's just because we're so similar.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.327
-[groans]
-[chuckles]

22:08.410 --> 22:10.120
I know, it sucks!

22:12.414 --> 22:16.918
Look, I turned out screwed up
because my dad screwed me up,

22:17.544 --> 22:19.046
but I don't want you to be screwed up.

22:19.129 --> 22:22.382
Wow. You never said
anything like that before.

22:22.466 --> 22:26.720
I know. When you're a dad,
you don't want to admit that you're human.

22:26.803 --> 22:27.804
I mean... [chuckles]

22:27.888 --> 22:30.891
I mean, I know you kids
see me as some sort of superman.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.517
-Villain.
-What?

22:32.601 --> 22:33.560
Nothing.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.772
I don't want us to be
the way I was with my dad

22:36.855 --> 22:40.025
and then let years go by
before it's too late to make it better.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.986
So, that's why I want to check in with you
every once in a while.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.781
I know you're pretty torn up about Alice.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.657
Eh, only when I think about her.

22:47.741 --> 22:51.078
And, well, any other time really.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.997
[sighs] It's not gonna be easy
getting over her.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.624
No, I... I... I see that.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.168
And I'm sorry
I didn't understand that at first.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.836
I guess I just thought it was puppy love.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.839
Dad, what me and Alice had
was grown-dog love!

23:02.923 --> 23:04.132
I know. I know.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.885
I... I mean, we were doing stuff
that would make a puppy explode.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.095
I got it. I got it.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.431
Kevin, this may surprise you,

23:11.515 --> 23:14.017
but you're not the first person
in the world to feel this way.

23:14.101 --> 23:18.063
When I was your age, I was so in love
with this beautiful blond.

23:18.146 --> 23:21.400
Even though I was so crazy about her,
she dumped me.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.401
Mom dumped you?

23:22.484 --> 23:26.154
Nah, I'm not talking about Mom.
This was Phyllis Hibberman.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.824
Ew, you had a girlfriend before Mom?

23:28.907 --> 23:29.783
Uh-huh.

23:29.866 --> 23:32.536
-Was she cute?
-Oh, she was gorgeous.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.287
All-hands-on-deck.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.956
Hoo-hoo. Ah-oo-gah.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.876
Well, not as gorgeous as your mom.
But yeah.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.338
Anyway, after she broke up with me,
boy, I was a wreck.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.549
I thought I was gonna die without her.

23:45.632 --> 23:50.595
I tried everything to get her back,
but she started dating Jack Draski.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.973
And they got married
and moved to Rhode Island.

23:53.056 --> 23:56.101
But, after a while, I got over it.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.729
And then I met your mom.
Take that, Phyllis.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.107
And you and Mom
have been together ever since, huh?

24:02.190 --> 24:04.067
Nah, we were on and off for a while.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.111
Had a real big fight back in '58.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.448
It's about me applying to flight school
before she was finished with college.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.824
Broke up for a bit.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.951
But we took our time to cool off.

24:13.034 --> 24:16.204
And then we got back together,
and it was better than before

24:16.288 --> 24:18.165
because we knew
we were meant for each other.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.249
Then what happened?

24:19.332 --> 24:21.918
[chuckles] Well, you happened.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.838
And the rest, as they say, is history.

24:24.921 --> 24:29.885
So I should stop chasing Alice around
and play it cool,

24:29.968 --> 24:32.637
and if we're meant to be, it'll be.

24:32.721 --> 24:36.266
Yeah. And if you're not, you won't,
and you'll be okay.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.310
So try not to worry.

24:38.393 --> 24:41.813
And don't tell your mom
about Phyllis Hibberman. She's her cousin.

24:41.897 --> 24:46.902
I could've been a stereo salesman,
living in Miami,

24:46.985 --> 24:51.948
uh, shirt unbuttoned to my navel,
drinking mojitos,

24:52.032 --> 24:55.035
banging Cuban refugees every night.

24:55.118 --> 25:00.165
But no. I had to make my mom happy
and be a man of God.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.500
[panting]

25:01.583 --> 25:03.126
Oh, hi, Maureen.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.588
Hi, Father Pat.
Are priests allowed to drink?

25:06.671 --> 25:09.049
It's the only thing we're allowed to do.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.802
You gotta have faith
that things are gonna be okay, right?

25:12.886 --> 25:14.262
I mean, you have to.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.847
You're right. I do.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.891
-Do you still have your faith?
-No.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.184
Aw.

25:19.267 --> 25:22.354
But you're a nice man,
and I don't want you to be sad.

25:22.437 --> 25:26.983
-There's people who need you.
-Like Cuban women in Miami?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.235
Sure.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.070
Amen.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.076
Can I get a whiskey double, please?
One ice cube.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.119
Keep your fingers out of the glass
this time?

25:38.203 --> 25:39.871
I got you! [grunts]

25:40.372 --> 25:42.916
Your taillight's broken, dirtbag!

25:42.999 --> 25:46.253
Look at those kids of ours. They're okay.

25:46.336 --> 25:49.422
Yeah. They're not screwups.
They just screwed up.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.175
All they needed was a little family time.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.844
Yeah. For all that parenting we did today,

25:54.928 --> 25:56.930
who knew the answer
would be in a bowling alley?

25:57.013 --> 25:59.057
Since it was my idea, I did.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.475
[both laugh]

26:01.560 --> 26:05.188
Speaking of family time, I think I want
to invite my mom and sister for Christmas.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.607
Wow, you really are drunk.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.775
[both laugh]

26:08.858 --> 26:10.360
I know.

26:10.443 --> 26:11.778
I know. They're the worst!

26:11.861 --> 26:13.405
And I want to invite Louis!

26:13.488 --> 26:16.741
-[both laugh]
-Yeah, yeah! Let's pile it on!

26:17.367 --> 26:21.079
-But not your fucking father.
-I'm drunk, not concussed.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.372
[both laugh]

26:22.455 --> 26:26.334
Oh, it'll be fun,
as long as we keep that eggnog flowing.

Speaking of flowing...

What are you doing, Frankie boy?

26:41.391 --> 26:43.310
No. Walk away.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.524
Okay, last one, I promise.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.444
But there's no way it'll fit.

Ah, shit.

There's nothing in there, Frank.
