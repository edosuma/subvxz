WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:09.009
So, what's the plan?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.577
Are we going to
turn off the lights

00:10.577 --> 00:12.078
and jump out
and yell surprise?

00:12.579 --> 00:13.580
Oh, yes, Roz.

00:13.580 --> 00:16.416
Let's startle a man who
just had open-heart surgery.

00:16.416 --> 00:19.753
Sorry. I can't get used
to thinking of Niles as sick.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.754
Oh, Niles is great.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.255
All these exercises he's doing

00:22.255 --> 00:24.691
he's going to be just as strong
as he ever was.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.626
Here's the guest of honor.

00:26.626 --> 00:30.530
Niles, good to see you out and about.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.498
You look great!

00:32.031 --> 00:32.966
Thank you. Thank you.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.467
I'll tell you
it's good to be out

00:34.968 --> 00:35.535
after being cooped up

00:35.969 --> 00:37.370
in that apartment all week.
Hello.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.140
I never thought I'd grow tired of reading Flaubert.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.141
Oh, please.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.675
He's been parked on his ass

00:42.675 --> 00:44.177
watching The Young
and The Restless.

00:44.177 --> 00:45.078
FRASIER:
Niles!

00:45.078 --> 00:45.945
Not the soaps!

00:45.945 --> 00:47.313
You can't be serious.

00:47.313 --> 00:49.082
Well, I'm hardly hooked.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.984
They fascinate me as cultural artifact.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.886
I was just telling Gertrude.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.321
Their use of stock figures is reminiscent

00:55.321 --> 00:56.823
of thecommedia dell'arte.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.325
Esther is Punchinell
o, Victor is Flavio

00:59.826 --> 01:03.263
and Nicki, well, she's just the town pump.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.567
Now do you see why
I need my own telly, Daphne?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.569
You have your
own telly in Manchester.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.037
(uneasy laughter)

01:11.404 --> 01:13.406
Here's champagne and sparkling
cider for you Niles

01:13.773 --> 01:15.742
and help yourself to brunch
whenever you're ready.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.144
Word to the wise:
Stay away from the sausage.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.646
They're not sausages, Dad.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.581
They're soysages.

01:21.948 --> 01:24.017
Niles is on
a postoperative diet.

01:24.517 --> 01:25.885
We are trying
to support him.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.554
Oh, sorry. What about the bacon?

01:27.787 --> 01:29.856
Fake-un.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.861
Hey, everyone,
I'd like to propose a toast.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.830
To my family and friends:

01:36.830 --> 01:39.799
Your love and support
have been overwhelming.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.468
DAPHNE:
Oh, Niles.

01:41.668 --> 01:42.735
During my operation

01:42.735 --> 01:45.505
I was technically dead
for several minutes.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.707
Yes, we know, son. You told us.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.176
But it gave me a fresh
perspective on everything.

01:50.677 --> 01:51.678
It took a brush with death

01:51.678 --> 01:53.980
to remind me how lucky I am
to be alive.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.149
And Gertrude,
thank you for giving up

01:56.449 --> 01:57.517
the guest bedroom

01:57.517 --> 01:59.519
so that I don't have
to climb all those stairs.

01:59.519 --> 02:01.521
Oh, no, I'm happy
to sleep on that sofa bed

02:01.521 --> 02:03.389
with the hard metal frame.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.526
You have a nice, soft
bed in Manchester.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.728
Oh, Daphne, it's okay.

02:08.728 --> 02:10.229
Her bracing honesty reminds me

02:10.229 --> 02:12.232
that I'm alive.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.101
You, you... Oh, you!

02:15.401 --> 02:18.338
You are a treasure to me.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.207
I cherish every day
we're together.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.711
Oh, thank you, Niles.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.713
There may be others
around here

02:26.713 --> 02:29.415
who could benefit
from a near-death experience.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.419
Well, let's eat before
the fake-un loses its shape.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.893
Wow, Niles is really loving
life with a vengeance.

02:40.193 --> 02:41.728
I was the same way
after I got shot.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.763
First day back at the precinct

02:43.763 --> 02:45.265
I went around
hugging all the guys

02:45.265 --> 02:47.066
Telling them all I loved 'em

02:47.267 --> 02:48.201
How long did that last?

02:48.535 --> 02:51.604
Until they started
calling me "Martina."

02:52.038 --> 02:53.606
It is kind of weird

02:53.606 --> 02:56.943
seeing Niles so lovey-dovey
with Mrs. Moon.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.311
Believe me,
when you're in that state

02:58.811 --> 03:00.780
you can find something to love
even in the biggest jerk.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.750
Roz, I want to tell you you are a treasure.

03:05.151 --> 03:07.554
Maybe I don't say it often enough,
but you are.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.455
Shut up, Martina.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.963
(humming)

03:16.963 --> 03:17.964
Hi.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.365
I know that song.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.135
0."
Yes, Mozart's
"Symphony Number 4

03:22.435 --> 03:23.503
Molto allegro.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.004
I've just bought
this new recording for Niles.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.005
It is fantastic.

03:26.506 --> 03:27.507
I've never heard
such string articulation.

03:27.507 --> 03:28.875
Oh, I remember
what it is.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.710
It's that commercial
with the singing cats.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.713
♪♪ If your cat has a yearnin
g for tuna ♪♪

03:33.713 --> 03:35.215
♪
♪♪ Da-da-da, ocean buffet... ♪

03:37.116 --> 03:38.685
One of the cats was wearing
a tiny tuxedo.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.019
Good.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.790
So few cats dress
for the symphony anymore.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.692
Frasier, Roz.
Oh, hi, guys.

03:46.192 --> 03:49.195
Guess who just walked
a mile on the treadmill.

03:49.195 --> 03:50.964
Oh, way to go, Niles.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.233
The doctor says he's
in the 95th percentile

03:53.233 --> 03:55.735
of patients recovering
from bypass surgery.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.238
95th percentile!
That's wonderful, Niles.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.239
Well, now, Frasier

03:59.239 --> 04:01.241
good health
is not a competition.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.244
When you've heard time's
winged chariot hurrying near

04:04.244 --> 04:06.246
as I have,
every day is a gift.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.247
Oh, yoiks.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.182
What tone-deaf prankster
gave you this?

04:09.182 --> 04:10.950
You've heard it?

04:11.217 --> 04:12.285
Well, as much as I could bear.

04:12.785 --> 04:13.786
Did you hear what the conductor did

04:13.786 --> 04:15.288
to the andante?

04:15.288 --> 04:17.156
I just hope
he bought it dinner first

04:17.156 --> 04:18.992
Well, I couldn't
agree more, Niles.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.694
Frasier, you said
you loved that CD.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.963
Well, Niles has convinced me
otherwise.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.898
You know, I'm in
the mood for a scone.

04:26.399 --> 04:27.767
Help me pick one out.
All right.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.602
That was weird.
I'll say.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.939
Who can't pick out
their own scone?

04:33.206 --> 04:34.653
No. I mean you and Niles.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.844
Usually that would have been
a two-hour argument

04:38.344 --> 04:40.647
ending in tears
and cursing in Italian.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.315
I'm afraid those days
are over, Roz.

04:42.682 --> 04:43.683
What happened?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.119
Well, it's a long story.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.621
Okay. When Niles
was in the hospital

04:49.122 --> 04:51.658
and he was being wheeled
into surgery...

04:54.661 --> 04:57.497
he looked so frail and vulnerable

04:57.497 --> 04:58.398
so I..

04:58.398 --> 05:02.802
I took my case
to a higher power.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.275
Hello, God.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.312
It'’’s me, Dr. Frasier Crane

05:12.812 --> 05:16.316
Though I don't talk to you
as often as perhaps I should

05:16.316 --> 05:18.818
I want to thank you
for all the times

05:18.818 --> 05:20.820
you've indulged me in the past

05:20.820 --> 05:23.823
Although, I have yet to see
the inside of the Empire Club--

05:23.823 --> 05:25.825
just kidding.

05:25.825 --> 05:33.333
Anyway, today I ask you to look
after my brother, Niles Crane.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.337
I love him, even if I don't always show it.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.339
And I regret all the time

05:39.839 --> 05:42.342
he and I wasted
in petty quarrels.

05:42.342 --> 05:47.347
If you spare him, oh, Lord,

05:47.347 --> 05:51.684
I promise to cherish
every moment we have together.

05:51.918 --> 05:52.985
But, Frasier,
you don't think

05:52.985 --> 05:54.987
God is going to strike Niles down

05:54.987 --> 05:56.789
if you get in an argument,
do you?

05:56.989 --> 06:00.560
Well, technically,
the way it's structured

06:00.560 --> 06:02.061
he'd come after me.

06:02.061 --> 06:06.065
Seeing as how I was the one

06:06.065 --> 06:08.401
that initiated the deal, you see?

06:08.634 --> 06:09.702
If I'd had more time,

06:09.702 --> 06:12.505
I might have worded thin
gs differently, but...

06:12.705 --> 06:14.240
Oh, oh, uh, le
t's get this to go

06:14.240 --> 06:15.775
My soap starts in 20 minutes.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.277
Ashley might come
out of her coma today.

06:18.277 --> 06:22.782
You know, since your
recovery is going so well

06:22.782 --> 06:24.784
maybe we should check you out

06:24.784 --> 06:27.286
make sure all your equipment's
working properly.

06:29.288 --> 06:33.292
You're not talking about my exercise bicycle,
are you?

06:33.292 --> 06:35.595
The doctor said
it would be okay.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.897
If you need
a second opinion

06:37.897 --> 06:40.900
maybe Nurse Naughty
could make a house call.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.406
I could use a checkup.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.409
But I think we should
err on the side of caution

06:49.409 --> 06:50.910
In a few weeks, I have another stress test.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.412
Thank you.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.914
And if all goes well,
Nurse Naughty will be

06:54.914 --> 06:57.417
one satisfied
healthcare professional.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.419
See you.

06:59.919 --> 07:00.920
Oh, bye, guys.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.922
Oh, Niles, wait.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.424
Frasier says he thinks

07:04.424 --> 07:06.926
the string articulation
is really good.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.294
In this?

07:08.294 --> 07:10.129
Frasier, you know
I hold your opinion

07:10.129 --> 07:12.031
in highest regard,
but are you nuts?

07:12.031 --> 07:13.933
Perhaps, I am, Niles.
Thank you.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.802
Maybe you just need
to get your hearing checked.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.271
I'll do that.
Thank you, Niles.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.273
(loudly):
I'll see you later!

07:20.273 --> 07:21.774
(chuckles)

07:21.774 --> 07:23.276
Very amusing.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.777
I get it.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.118
Oh, oh, here they are.

07:32.385 --> 07:40.626
Frasier, Frasier,
tell them what you told me.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.131
I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.400
Perhaps this is why
I was spared.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.471
Niles, how was your stress test?

07:51.771 --> 07:54.340
Oh, the doctor cleared me
to return to normal food

07:54.340 --> 07:55.675
and regular physical activity.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.910
Oh, Darling,
that's wonderful.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.613
Yes, yes.
In moderation, of course.

08:00.613 --> 08:01.948
Congratulations, son.

08:02.448 --> 08:03.316
Perhaps now, Niles

08:03.316 --> 08:04.984
we can get back
to the squash courts.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.186
Oh, I don't think so.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.722
But the doctor said
it was okay.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.491
Yeah, but shouldn't there
be more to life

08:11.491 --> 08:13.326
than competition for useless bragging rights?

08:13.326 --> 08:15.661
You didn't think they
were useless three months ago

08:16.162 --> 08:17.063
when you won.

08:17.063 --> 08:20.833
You bragged for three months.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.169
I've changed a lot
since then.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.171
The point is that
I have roses

08:25.171 --> 08:26.572
to stop and smell.

08:26.572 --> 08:28.474
I see. So, let me
get this straight.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.343
You're going to give up squash and smell roses.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.678
Poor Frasier.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.049
I hope that you don't have to go
through what I did

08:37.283 --> 08:39.184
in order to become
as wise as I have.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.020
You can still be wise
and play squash, darling.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.457
Daphne's right.
Go out, have some fun.

08:44.824 --> 08:45.892
But I am having fun.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.895
Since my incident,
birds sing more sweetly.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.363
The sky is so much bluer.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.665
Niles, it has rained
every day this week.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.302
I see rain differently, too.

08:56.302 --> 08:57.670
There's something I need
to tell you.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.972
It's something I've been thinking about.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.807
(thunder crashing)

09:05.645 --> 09:07.380
You were saying, Frasier?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.016
Nothing.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.091
My grandmother died
a couple of weeks ago

09:19.325 --> 09:20.693
and I feel bad
because I never told her

09:20.927 --> 09:22.461
how much she meant to me.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.430
Well, my heart certainly
goes out to you.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.767
Grieving is difficult enough
without those unresolved...

09:28.034 --> 09:29.101
Frasier, I'm sorry.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.504
But we have Dr. Niles Crane
on line two.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.441
I'm sure you all remember my brother Niles...

09:35.942 --> 09:38.945
from our last segment.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.414
I'm sure all my listeners join me

09:41.414 --> 09:44.450
in hoping he can get back
to work real soon.

09:44.450 --> 09:45.418
Thank you, Frasier.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.453
I just thought I'd add
the perspective

09:47.453 --> 09:50.790
of one who has ducked
the scythe of the Grim Reaper.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.025
By all means.
Go ahead, Niles.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.896
Your grandmother knows
how you feel.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.398
When I was briefly dead

09:59.398 --> 10:01.901
the overriding feeling I had

10:01.901 --> 10:05.237
was the love of my family
and friends.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.073
MAN:
Wow, so I shouldn't
feel bad?

10:07.073 --> 10:08.074
NILES:
Certainly not.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.042
Get out there
and live your life, Grant.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.411
Carpe that diem.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.413
Isn't that right, Frasier?

10:14.413 --> 10:16.482
I couldn't agree more, Niles

10:16.482 --> 10:18.918
We'll be right back
after traffic.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.074

10:28.828 --> 10:31.197
I'm beginning to regret
betting on the clown.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.966
Roz, I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.435
I just lie in bed
awake at night

10:36.435 --> 10:38.938
mentally arguing
with Niles.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.407
And I win every time!

10:41.407 --> 10:42.608
Frasier,
this is insane

10:42.908 --> 10:45.478
Do you really think
something bad is going to happen

10:45.478 --> 10:46.979
if you break your deal with God?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.447
Oh, of course not.

10:48.447 --> 10:49.448
Well, maybe a little.

10:49.448 --> 10:50.416
I don't know.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.621
Roz, my brother could have died.

10:55.621 --> 10:59.158
I can't be ungrateful
to whatever higher power

10:59.158 --> 11:00.660
may have spared him.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.161
I just can't imagine

11:02.161 --> 11:04.163
that God would be upset...

11:04.163 --> 11:05.498
Roz!
Oh, he's God,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.833
Have you read
the Old Testamtent?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.235
He can be ruthless!

11:09.235 --> 11:12.138
Traffic's done.
You're on in five.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.642
Welcome back, Seattle.

11:16.642 --> 11:19.145
Oh, I see we have someone
on line two.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.647
Go ahead, caller. I'm listening.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.149
NILES:
Still me, Frasier.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.583
Say, I had some thoughts

11:24.583 --> 11:26.952
about your advice to Cynthia
from Tacoma.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.821
Speaking as one who has walked

11:28.821 --> 11:30.890
through the valley
of the shadow of death

11:31.357 --> 11:33.826
Cynthia,
I think diet and exercise

11:33.826 --> 11:35.394
should take care
of your problems.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.397
Nothing like a good
fat-free muffin...

11:41.834 --> 11:42.902
Hi, Daph,
I'm here for Niles.

11:42.902 --> 11:43.903
He's at your place.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.805
He said you were meeting
him there for dinner.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.108
I specifically told him
I would pick him up here.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.476
Sorry.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.479
Not bad enough he usurps
my radio show...

11:53.479 --> 11:55.281
What are you doing?

11:55.514 --> 11:58.084
Oh, you'll think I'm silly

11:58.084 --> 12:00.352
but I'm donating food to the poor.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.155
Why would I think that's silly?
What does that say about me?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.024
No, I was just going to say...

12:05.024 --> 12:06.392
I do my bit
for charity, you know.

12:06.692 --> 12:07.760
You have no idea
how many vacations

12:08.260 --> 12:09.695
I've bought
at silent auctions.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.664
No, that's not it.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.166
You see, when I found out
Niles needed heart surgery

12:14.166 --> 12:16.168
I felt so scared and helpless.

12:16.168 --> 12:19.672
So, I kind of made a vow
that if he came out okay

12:19.672 --> 12:22.174
I would spend more time
helping the less fortunate.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.611
A vow?
You mean like a promise to God?

12:25.978 --> 12:28.013
I know it must sound absurd
to you, a man of science.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.049
No, no.

12:30.049 --> 12:30.983
Now, when...

12:31.317 --> 12:33.385
exactly did you make
this promise?

12:33.786 --> 12:35.254
The night before his surgery.

12:35.554 --> 12:38.591
The night before, you say.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.459
Interesting.

12:40.826 --> 12:41.894
You say Niles
is at my place?

12:41.894 --> 12:43.395
Yeah.

12:43.395 --> 12:44.897
Excuse me.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.899
Keep up the good work.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.404
What's all this?

12:52.404 --> 12:53.405
Food for the poor.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.408
Oh, must be nice
to be poor

12:56.408 --> 12:59.245
and have people just
giving you food.

13:00.913 --> 13:04.083
Daphne, you were up
awfully late last night.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.452
Yeah, I was watching television.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.920
Were you?

13:07.920 --> 13:10.422
Or was that husband of yours
sneaking upstairs

13:10.422 --> 13:13.926
to demand you perform your wifely chore?

13:13.926 --> 13:14.927
I wish.

13:15.427 --> 13:18.330
He's still not ready to be
in the same bed with me.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.233
He's rich and you don't
have to sleep with him?

13:21.233 --> 13:23.102
Rub it in, why don't you?

13:25.004 --> 13:27.006
I know he's trying
to ease back into things

13:27.506 --> 13:30.009
but it's been weeks since
the doctor said he was okay.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.478
Well, isn't it obvious?

13:33.012 --> 13:36.482
The poor thing's probably
not feeling very attractive.

13:36.482 --> 13:42.388
He's all skinny and pale,
and now he has that scar, too.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.790
I don't think
that's it, Mum.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.293
I just think he's scared.
And I understand that.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.562
But how long are we going
to go on like this?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.764
Until you stop babying him.

13:51.764 --> 13:52.631
I'm not babying him.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.133
I'm just giving him
the time he needs.

13:54.633 --> 13:55.634
Oh, piffle.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.870
What he needs is
a swift kick in the bum.

13:58.103 --> 14:02.074
Look, you've got to seduce him.

14:02.408 --> 14:05.477
Use your feminine wiles.

14:05.477 --> 14:09.815
That's how your brother Billy landed Kevin.

14:10.082 --> 14:14.620
Well, sharing a cell helped.

14:15.054 --> 14:19.525
You know, maybe
I'll give that a try.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.461
When Niles walks into
that guest room tonight

14:22.461 --> 14:24.964
I'll have a surprise
waiting for him--

14:24.964 --> 14:27.967
candles, soft music,
a negligee...

14:27.967 --> 14:29.468
nothing too sexy.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.836
We don't want
to strain his heart.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.639
There's nothing wrong with your ego.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.507
Thanks for the advice, Mum.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.509
My pleasure, love.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.979
Oh, and since you and Niles
will be in the guest room

14:39.979 --> 14:41.480
I'll sleep in your room tonight.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.884
No sense in letting that
king-size bed go to waste.

14:45.251 --> 14:48.087
This time use a coaster
when you take your teeth out.

14:51.857 --> 14:54.393
Stop the tape.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.728
Who's he again?

14:55.995 --> 14:57.062
That's Diego

14:57.062 --> 14:59.031
the illegitimate son
of Sonya LaFontaine.

15:00.799 --> 15:03.369
He joined the army to avenge
the death of his brother.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.871
Although, frankly,
I'm a little worried about him

15:05.871 --> 15:09.174
I'm not sure he's figh
this war for the right reasons.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.510
Hey, you want some of this fancy dessert?

15:11.510 --> 15:12.511
It must be really good

15:12.511 --> 15:14.513
because Frasier told
me not to touch it

15:14.513 --> 15:16.015
No, no, thanks.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.450
I brought some of these
tasty rye flats

15:18.851 --> 15:22.888
in case I...
in case I feel peckish.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.890
They look like wood.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.763
Well, he di

15:30.763 --> 15:32.731
But, you know, I feel my tastes
have gotten simpler

15:33.232 --> 15:35.234
since I cheated death.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.076
It's hard to explain.

15:44.343 --> 15:45.411
Don't need to explain
to me, son.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.413
I know what it's like
to cheat death.

15:47.413 --> 15:48.747
That's true.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.350
Although I think I got a little
closer than you did.

15:51.350 --> 15:55.587
Oh, really?

15:55.587 --> 15:57.656
Well, let's see...

15:57.656 --> 16:02.628
I got shot by a gun
and you ate a bunch of cheese.

16:02.628 --> 16:06.098
I was clinically dead
for several minutes.

16:06.098 --> 16:08.334
I looked death
square in the eye.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.503
You may have looked him in
the eye, but I shook his hand.

16:11.503 --> 16:14.273
Really?
Well, I kissed him on the cheek.

16:14.273 --> 16:17.176
Well, I kissed him on the lips.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.945
Also, Death was a girl.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.848
Dad, I don't want to turn this into a competition.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.284
I'm just trying to embrace life to the fullest.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.753
Oh, would you
give it a rest.

16:27.753 --> 16:28.754
Excuse me?

16:28.754 --> 16:30.255
You haven't embraced a damn thing.

16:30.255 --> 16:31.256
All you're doing is yakking about

16:31.256 --> 16:32.758
feeling this and
experiencing that.

16:32.758 --> 16:33.659
You're not doing anything.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.362
You won't go back to work

16:36.362 --> 16:38.630
or play squash or eat
any of your favorite foods.

16:39.031 --> 16:42.601
I'm easing into things
until I'm back to normal.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.536
The doctor says you're there.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.006
Well, I'm just being
extra cautious.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.743
Sounds to me like you're afraid, son.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.512
Well, what if I am?

16:53.512 --> 16:55.014
Haven't I earned the right to be afraid?

16:55.514 --> 16:56.415
I could have died.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.317
I understand.
Okay.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.818
When I got out of the hospital

17:00.319 --> 17:02.154
I was terrified to take a risk.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.990
Just didn't want
to leave the house.

17:04.990 --> 17:09.494
Ducked for cover every time
a car backfired.

17:09.494 --> 17:14.967
I know my fears aren't rational.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.469
I know my heart is sound.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.472
I feel fine.

17:20.472 --> 17:22.241
But I felt fine
before this happened.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.309
How do I know

17:24.309 --> 17:25.644
that the same thing isn't.

17:25.644 --> 17:26.645
You don't know.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.647
That's exactly
what I came to realize.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.149
Life's a crap shoot.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.151
We could all go at any time.

17:32.651 --> 17:35.921
That's why we have to make the
most of whatever time we've got.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.192
Like sand through the hourglass

17:40.692 --> 17:43.529
so are the days of our lives.

17:43.529 --> 17:47.866
Okay, point taken.

17:49.868 --> 17:50.869
Thank you, Dad.

17:50.869 --> 17:52.337
Where are you going?

17:52.337 --> 17:54.206
To live my life.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.975
You forgot the rye flats.

17:57.309 --> 18:01.380
No, I didn't, Dad.
No, I didn't.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.182
Well, you're not
leaving them here.

18:10.522 --> 18:12.024
Good evening.

18:22.401 --> 18:23.902
Hello, God, it's me again.

18:23.902 --> 18:27.406
Dr. Frasier Crane.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.909
Listen, it seems that when
we made our little arrangement

18:31.410 --> 18:34.713
there was another deal in place.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.982
Now, I've had some experience
with double-booking

18:36.982 --> 18:39.485
and I know that the person
who books first

18:39.485 --> 18:42.287
always gets priority.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.590
So, as long as Daphne
keeps up her end...

18:44.590 --> 18:47.593
which she is, to the letter--

18:47.593 --> 18:50.596
it seems our little arrangement

18:51.096 --> 18:54.099
would be rendered null and void.

18:54.600 --> 19:00.439
Ergo, I am now going to yell
at my brother.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.775
Unless of course, you give me a sign.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.250
Very well, then.

19:11.250 --> 19:15.020
This is going to be sweet.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.421
(elevator dings)

19:16.755 --> 19:18.090
Niles!

19:18.290 --> 19:19.291
There you are.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.359
You're 40 minutes late.
Well, no matter.

19:20.859 --> 19:21.793
I have more important things to do.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.362
Not so fast, mister!

19:23.362 --> 19:25.330
You, sir, have been
insufferable for the
past few weeks.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.832
It might enlighten
you to know

19:26.832 --> 19:27.833
that your endless preaching

19:28.333 --> 19:29.835
has been nothing more
than a thin cover

19:29.835 --> 19:31.270
for your fear...
Yes, I know.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.704
I know, Dad just told me.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.573
And he was right,
I've been an ass lately.

19:34.873 --> 19:35.941
I'm really sorry,
but I have to go.

19:36.441 --> 19:37.276
My wife is waiting for me.

19:37.543 --> 19:38.610
Frankly, Frasier,

19:38.610 --> 19:39.912
I'm surprised you didn't
bring this up sooner.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.280
But...

19:50.289 --> 19:53.292
Huh.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.794
Well played, God.

20:02.301 --> 20:04.303
I'll see you at Easter.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.223
(high-pitched scream)

20:28.527 --> 20:29.828
Niles!

20:29.828 --> 20:31.029
What happened?

20:33.865 --> 20:34.833
Are you all right?
Yes.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.135
I just jumped into bed
with your mother.

20:37.135 --> 20:39.338
Oh, dear.
No wonder she screamed.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.506
That wasn't her.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.642
What were you doing in there?

20:43.642 --> 20:47.913
I just... wanted to...
