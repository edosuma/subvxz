WEBVTT

00:08.876 --> 00:11.208
I wish you all
the happiness in the world.

00:14.167 --> 00:16.834
Myrcella?

00:17.751 --> 00:19.001
Myrcella?

00:32.083 --> 00:33.208
Kill us!

00:42.125 --> 00:44.166
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

00:44.167 --> 00:45.876
Please try not to scream.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.375
This is Brandon Stark.

00:52.042 --> 00:53.375
Son of Ned Stark.

00:53.709 --> 00:55.208
Let's get them inside.

00:56.417 --> 00:57.875
For decades,
House Lannister

00:57.876 --> 00:59.584
has been
the true power in Westeros,

00:59.876 --> 01:02.624
and the feat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

01:02.625 --> 01:05.041
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

01:05.042 --> 01:06.083
and take it.

01:06.375 --> 01:07.584
Summon Jon Snow.

01:07.876 --> 01:09.375
He would make
a valuable ally.

01:09.959 --> 01:12.082
Let him stand before you
and tell you the things

01:12.083 --> 01:13.125
that have happened to him.

01:13.542 --> 01:16.375
Dragonstone sits
on a mountain of dragonglass.

01:16.709 --> 01:20.208
We can never hope to defeat
the army of the dead alone.

01:20.417 --> 01:21.417
We need allies.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.249
You're abandoning your people!
You're abandoning your home.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.917
Until I return,
the North is yours.

The bastard
of Winterfell.

04:05.915 --> 04:08.123
The dwarf
of Casterly Rock.

04:13.373 --> 04:15.497
I believe we last saw each other
atop the Wall.

04:15.498 --> 04:19.414
You were pissing off the edge
if I remember right.

04:19.415 --> 04:21.872
Picked up some scars
along the road.

04:21.873 --> 04:26.373
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

04:28.373 --> 04:29.872
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

04:29.873 --> 04:33.705
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

04:33.706 --> 04:36.788
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

04:36.789 --> 04:39.372
Unluckily for me.

04:39.373 --> 04:42.415
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

04:44.081 --> 04:45.788
Welcome to Dragonstone.

04:45.789 --> 04:47.622
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

04:47.623 --> 04:50.997
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

04:50.998 --> 04:53.748
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

04:59.373 --> 05:00.748
Of course.

05:25.373 --> 05:26.915
Please, this way.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.247
Where are you from?

05:33.248 --> 05:35.538
I can't place
the accent.

05:35.539 --> 05:37.372
I was born on
the Island of Naath.

05:37.373 --> 05:40.456
Ah. I hear it's beautiful
down there.

05:40.457 --> 05:42.538
Palm trees
and butterflies.

05:42.539 --> 05:43.956
Haven't been, myself.

05:48.123 --> 05:49.915
This place has changed.

05:56.290 --> 05:59.414
And Sansa?
I hear she's alive and well.

05:59.415 --> 06:01.915
- She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

06:05.081 --> 06:07.497
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

06:07.498 --> 06:10.663
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

06:10.664 --> 06:12.580
Anyway...

06:12.581 --> 06:15.414
she's much smarter
than she lets on.

06:15.415 --> 06:17.788
She's starting
to let on.

06:17.789 --> 06:18.706
Good.

06:18.707 --> 06:20.747
At some point,

06:20.748 --> 06:24.705
I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit
became King in the North.

06:24.706 --> 06:26.497
As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

06:26.498 --> 06:29.289
became Hand
to Daenerys Targaryen.

06:29.290 --> 06:31.414
A long
and bloody tale.

06:31.415 --> 06:34.165
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

06:36.789 --> 06:39.331
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.747
Of course they do.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.457
If I was your Hand,
I would have advised against it.

06:46.081 --> 06:47.997
General rule of thumb--

06:47.998 --> 06:51.122
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

06:51.123 --> 06:52.872
True...

06:52.873 --> 06:54.997
but I'm not a Stark.

07:09.248 --> 07:10.498
I'd say you get
used to them...

07:13.248 --> 07:14.706
but you never
really do.

07:18.248 --> 07:21.498
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

07:33.873 --> 07:37.456
I wondered why you weren't there
to meet our guests.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.456
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

07:40.457 --> 07:42.914
Don't you want
to see him again?

07:42.915 --> 07:45.538
I've done my part.

07:45.539 --> 07:47.955
I've brought
ice and fire together.

07:47.956 --> 07:50.247
Strange.

07:50.248 --> 07:52.747
You spoke so highly
of Jon Snow,

07:52.748 --> 07:56.414
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

07:56.415 --> 07:58.788
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

07:58.789 --> 08:02.997
My time whispering in the ears of kings
has come to an end.

08:02.998 --> 08:05.414
Oh, I doubt that.

08:05.415 --> 08:08.039
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

08:08.040 --> 08:10.872
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

08:10.873 --> 08:14.122
Nothing is ever
so sweet again.

08:14.123 --> 08:17.373
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.289
I did not part
on good terms

08:21.290 --> 08:24.289
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

08:24.290 --> 08:25.290
Why?

08:26.956 --> 08:28.998
Because of
mistakes I made.

08:31.123 --> 08:32.998
Terrible mistakes.

08:34.831 --> 08:37.955
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

08:37.956 --> 08:40.164
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

08:40.164 --> 08:42.164
Good.

08:42.164 --> 08:44.414
If you don't mind
my saying,

08:44.415 --> 08:48.164
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

08:48.165 --> 08:50.623
I'm not sure
you'd be safe here.

08:52.539 --> 08:55.747
Oh, I will return,
dear Spider.

08:55.748 --> 08:57.538
- One last time.
- My lady--

08:57.539 --> 09:01.122
I have to die
in this strange country.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.956
Just like you.

09:45.207 --> 09:46.830
You stand in the presence

09:46.831 --> 09:49.622
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

09:49.623 --> 09:51.830
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

09:51.831 --> 09:54.788
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

09:54.789 --> 09:57.206
Protector
of the Seven Kingdoms,

09:57.207 --> 09:58.914
the Mother of Dragons,

09:58.915 --> 10:01.122
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

10:01.123 --> 10:04.915
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.706
This is Jon Snow.

10:15.706 --> 10:17.498
He's King
in the North.

10:20.207 --> 10:22.372
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

10:22.373 --> 10:24.622
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

10:24.623 --> 10:26.206
The winds were kind,
Your Grace.

10:26.207 --> 10:30.206
Apologies, I have
a Flea Bottom accent, I know,

10:30.207 --> 10:33.080
but Jon Snow
is King in the North, Your Grace.

10:33.081 --> 10:34.914
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me--

10:34.915 --> 10:37.164
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

10:37.165 --> 10:39.080
Forgive me,
Ser Davos.

10:39.081 --> 10:41.705
I never did receive
a formal education,

10:41.706 --> 10:43.039
but I could have
sworn I read

10:43.040 --> 10:46.331
the last King in the North
was Torrhen Stark,

10:46.332 --> 10:49.497
who bent the knee
to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

10:49.498 --> 10:52.705
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

10:52.706 --> 10:57.747
Torrhen Stark swore fealty
to House Targaryen in perpetuity.

10:57.748 --> 10:59.247
Or do I have
my facts wrong?

10:59.248 --> 11:01.580
I wasn't there,
Your Grace.

11:01.581 --> 11:03.997
No, of course not.

11:03.998 --> 11:06.580
But still,
an oath is an oath.

11:06.581 --> 11:08.997
And perpetuity means--

11:08.998 --> 11:11.456
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

11:11.457 --> 11:12.955
Forever.

11:12.956 --> 11:15.039
Forever.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.872
So I assume, my lord...

11:17.873 --> 11:20.081
...you're here
to bend the knee.

11:22.623 --> 11:24.165
I am not.

11:25.789 --> 11:27.289
Oh.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.123
Well, that is
unfortunate.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.122
You've traveled
all this way

11:32.123 --> 11:34.289
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

11:34.290 --> 11:36.788
Break faith?

11:36.789 --> 11:39.122
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

11:39.123 --> 11:40.830
He burned
my uncle alive.

11:40.831 --> 11:42.164
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms--

11:42.165 --> 11:45.248
My father...
was an evil man.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.290
On behalf
of House Targaryen...

11:50.539 --> 11:52.164
I ask your forgiveness

11:52.165 --> 11:55.122
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

11:55.123 --> 11:57.997
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

11:57.998 --> 12:00.373
by the sins
of her father.

12:01.831 --> 12:05.331
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

12:05.332 --> 12:07.206
and those were
the best centuries

12:07.207 --> 12:09.331
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

12:09.332 --> 12:11.830
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

12:11.831 --> 12:14.663
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

12:14.664 --> 12:18.663
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

12:18.664 --> 12:22.414
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

12:22.415 --> 12:24.830
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

12:24.831 --> 12:28.497
Bend the knee and I will name you
Warden of the North.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.705
Together, we will
save this country

12:30.706 --> 12:33.332
from those
who would destroy it.

12:43.165 --> 12:45.206
You're right.

12:45.207 --> 12:47.705
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

12:47.706 --> 12:52.538
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.538
Then why are you here?

12:54.539 --> 12:57.373
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

13:00.581 --> 13:02.538
Did you see
three dragons

13:02.539 --> 13:04.497
flying overhead
when you arrived?

13:04.498 --> 13:05.580
I did.

13:05.581 --> 13:07.872
And did you see
the Dothraki,

13:07.873 --> 13:10.080
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

13:10.081 --> 13:12.039
They're hard to miss.

13:12.040 --> 13:16.080
- But still, I need your help?
- Not to defeat Cersei.

13:16.081 --> 13:19.414
You could storm King's Landing tomorrow
and the city would fall.

13:19.415 --> 13:21.663
Hell, we almost took it
and we didn't even have dragons.

13:21.664 --> 13:25.788
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

13:25.789 --> 13:27.414
Why not?

13:27.415 --> 13:29.122
The only reason
I can see

13:29.123 --> 13:31.372
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

13:31.373 --> 13:33.414
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

13:33.415 --> 13:35.247
but you won't do it,

13:35.248 --> 13:38.456
which means,
at the very least,

13:38.457 --> 13:39.915
you're better
than Cersei.

13:41.415 --> 13:44.789
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

13:46.664 --> 13:51.289
Because right now,
you and I and Cersei and everyone else,

13:51.290 --> 13:52.914
we're children
playing at a game,

13:52.915 --> 13:54.997
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

13:54.998 --> 13:57.122
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

13:57.123 --> 14:00.622
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

14:00.623 --> 14:03.497
he's refused to bow,
and now he's calling me a child.

14:03.498 --> 14:07.289
I believe he's calling all of us children.
Figure of speech.

14:07.290 --> 14:10.622
Your Grace, everyone you know will die
before winter's over

14:10.623 --> 14:12.788
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

14:12.789 --> 14:15.456
As far as I can see,
you  are the enemy to the north.

14:15.457 --> 14:17.123
I am not your enemy.

14:18.539 --> 14:20.456
The dead
are the enemy.

14:20.457 --> 14:21.998
The dead?

14:23.290 --> 14:24.872
Is that another
figure of speech?

14:24.873 --> 14:26.497
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

14:26.498 --> 14:28.580
The Army of the Dead?

14:28.581 --> 14:30.747
You don't
know me well, my lord,

14:30.748 --> 14:34.080
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

14:34.081 --> 14:36.622
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

14:36.623 --> 14:38.747
The Army of the Dead
is real.

14:38.748 --> 14:40.206
The white walkers
are real.

14:40.207 --> 14:43.122
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

14:43.123 --> 14:44.663
If they get
past the Wall

14:44.664 --> 14:47.165
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

14:50.207 --> 14:51.789
we're finished.

14:57.373 --> 14:59.664
I was born
at Dragonstone.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.997
Not that I can
remember it.

15:03.998 --> 15:07.456
We fled before
Robert's assassins could find us.

15:07.457 --> 15:10.663
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

15:10.664 --> 15:14.497
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

15:14.498 --> 15:17.040
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

15:18.498 --> 15:20.415
Not that it matters now,
of course.

15:21.956 --> 15:25.497
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

15:25.498 --> 15:27.872
So many men
have tried to kill me,

15:27.873 --> 15:31.372
I don't remember
all their names.

15:31.373 --> 15:35.456
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

15:35.457 --> 15:38.997
I've been chained
and betrayed,

15:38.998 --> 15:41.788
raped and defiled.

15:41.789 --> 15:44.039
Do you know
what kept me standing

15:44.040 --> 15:46.997
through all those years
in exile?

15:46.998 --> 15:49.955
Faith.

15:49.956 --> 15:52.206
Not in any gods,

15:52.207 --> 15:55.747
not in myths
and legends.

15:55.748 --> 15:58.372
In myself.

15:58.373 --> 16:01.538
In Daenerys Targaryen.

16:01.539 --> 16:05.080
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

16:05.081 --> 16:07.456
until my children
were born.

16:07.457 --> 16:12.247
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

16:12.248 --> 16:14.622
They did for me.

16:14.623 --> 16:19.080
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

16:19.081 --> 16:21.207
and I will.

16:23.539 --> 16:26.080
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

16:26.081 --> 16:28.415
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

16:29.831 --> 16:33.039
The war against my sister
has already begun.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.414
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

16:35.415 --> 16:37.247
and join you
in fighting

16:37.248 --> 16:38.748
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

16:41.623 --> 16:43.164
You don't believe him.

16:43.165 --> 16:46.080
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

16:46.081 --> 16:49.872
But if destiny has brought
Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,

16:49.873 --> 16:53.080
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

16:53.081 --> 16:56.206
You were the first
to bring Dothraki to Westeros?

16:56.207 --> 16:59.580
He is the first to make allies of
wildlings and Northmen.

16:59.581 --> 17:01.663
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

17:01.664 --> 17:02.747
He was named
King in the North.

17:02.748 --> 17:04.122
Not because
of his birthright.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.497
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

17:06.498 --> 17:11.538
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

17:11.539 --> 17:13.248
because they
believe in him.

17:14.664 --> 17:16.622
All those things
you don't believe in,

17:16.623 --> 17:18.164
he faced
those things.

17:18.165 --> 17:20.372
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.954
He risked his life
for his people.

17:21.955 --> 17:23.747
He took a knife in the heart
for his people.

17:23.748 --> 17:25.498
He gave his own--

17:31.664 --> 17:34.414
If we don't put aside our enmities
and band together,

17:34.415 --> 17:36.497
we will die.

17:36.498 --> 17:40.164
And then it doesn't matter
whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

17:40.165 --> 17:42.497
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

17:42.498 --> 17:44.663
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

17:44.664 --> 17:46.289
help her to defeat
my sister,

17:46.290 --> 17:48.456
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

17:48.457 --> 17:50.206
There's no time
for that.

17:50.207 --> 17:52.122
There's no time
for any of this!

17:52.123 --> 17:53.622
While we stand here,
debating--

17:53.623 --> 17:55.580
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

17:55.581 --> 17:57.414
Pledge your sword
to her cause.

17:57.415 --> 17:59.165
And why
would I do that?

18:02.040 --> 18:04.164
I mean no offense,
Your Grace,

18:04.165 --> 18:05.372
but I don't know you.

18:05.373 --> 18:07.206
As far as I can tell,

18:07.207 --> 18:10.497
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

18:10.498 --> 18:13.831
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

18:15.748 --> 18:17.622
The lords of the North

18:17.623 --> 18:20.456
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

18:20.457 --> 18:24.498
and I will continue to do so
as well as I can.

18:25.748 --> 18:27.207
That's fair.

18:28.706 --> 18:30.580
It's also fair
to point out

18:30.581 --> 18:34.705
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

18:34.706 --> 18:38.456
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

18:38.457 --> 18:40.372
you are in
open rebellion.

18:50.332 --> 18:52.663
Your Grace, please
dismiss your guests.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.748
I have grave news.

18:57.290 --> 18:59.164
You must forgive
my manners.

18:59.165 --> 19:01.538
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

19:01.539 --> 19:04.290
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

19:13.748 --> 19:15.081
Am I your prisoner?

19:19.081 --> 19:20.373
Not yet.

19:37.789 --> 19:39.497
Our ironborn
and Dornish allies

19:39.498 --> 19:40.955
were attacked
en route to Dorne.

19:40.956 --> 19:43.456
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

19:43.457 --> 19:45.788
the rest,
sunk or captured.

19:45.789 --> 19:48.372
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

19:48.373 --> 19:50.955
The Greyjoys,
dead or captured.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.664
All of them?

19:55.915 --> 19:57.788
- Pull!
- Heave!

19:57.789 --> 19:59.164
Pull!

20:09.415 --> 20:10.873
Your sister's dead?

20:12.373 --> 20:14.414
Euron has her.

20:14.415 --> 20:15.789
You saw him take her?

20:18.081 --> 20:21.456
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

20:21.457 --> 20:22.956
I tried.

20:24.248 --> 20:26.332
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

20:30.831 --> 20:32.705
Come, men!

20:32.706 --> 20:34.040
Sails up!

20:42.664 --> 20:44.664
Murderer!

20:55.415 --> 20:57.538
Whores!

20:57.539 --> 20:59.873
Traitor!

21:03.706 --> 21:04.998
This is the life.

21:06.207 --> 21:09.872
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.788
I have to be honest,

21:15.789 --> 21:17.748
this is making me hard.

21:20.748 --> 21:22.456
Did you see
Little Theon's face

21:22.457 --> 21:24.830
right before
he jumped overboard?

21:24.831 --> 21:27.372
"Oh, no!"

21:27.373 --> 21:28.831
What a twat.

21:56.581 --> 21:59.539
- Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Murderers!

22:32.831 --> 22:36.164
My queen,
please accept this gift

22:36.165 --> 22:39.998
on behalf of all of your loyal subjects
in the Iron Islands.

22:44.956 --> 22:49.164
I give you
what no other man could give--

22:49.165 --> 22:51.289
justice.

22:51.290 --> 22:54.956
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

23:04.498 --> 23:08.497
You've proven yourself
the greatest captain on the fourteen seas

23:08.498 --> 23:11.164
and a true friend
to the crown.

23:11.165 --> 23:14.372
You deserve more
than a true friend.

23:14.373 --> 23:17.872
And you deserve
a proper reward for your heroism.

23:17.873 --> 23:20.539
There's only
one reward I want.

23:21.831 --> 23:24.539
You shall have
what your heart desires...

23:26.581 --> 23:28.123
when the war is won.

23:34.498 --> 23:37.955
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

23:37.956 --> 23:41.122
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

23:41.123 --> 23:43.164
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

23:43.165 --> 23:45.456
shall defend our country.

23:51.956 --> 23:54.705
There's nothing
quite like it, is there?

23:54.706 --> 23:56.456
The love of the people.

23:56.457 --> 23:58.580
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

23:58.581 --> 24:01.914
This same mob
spat at my sister not long ago.

24:01.915 --> 24:03.663
And if you turn
on us,

24:03.664 --> 24:06.872
they'll cheer to see your head
mounted on a spike.

24:06.873 --> 24:08.372
Or yours.

24:08.373 --> 24:11.497
They just like
severed heads, really.

24:11.498 --> 24:14.747
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

24:14.748 --> 24:16.331
I would love to hear it.

24:16.332 --> 24:19.372
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

24:19.373 --> 24:21.080
Advice?

24:21.081 --> 24:24.747
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

24:24.748 --> 24:26.414
A finger in the bum?

24:26.415 --> 24:29.706
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

24:47.539 --> 24:50.497
I want you to know
I understand.

24:50.498 --> 24:52.080
Even though
we're enemies, you and I,

24:52.081 --> 24:53.748
I understand the fury
that drives you.

24:54.915 --> 24:56.247
I was there that day

24:56.248 --> 24:58.040
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

25:00.581 --> 25:02.914
If I close my eyes,

25:02.915 --> 25:05.205
I can hear the sound
of Oberyn's skull breaking.

25:05.915 --> 25:08.122
The sound
of your scream.

25:08.123 --> 25:09.622
I never heard
a sound like that.

25:09.623 --> 25:11.581
I thought,
"That's true love."

25:13.165 --> 25:15.456
Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
He really did.

25:15.457 --> 25:16.830
No one moved like him.

25:16.831 --> 25:19.955
No one had such skill
with a spear.

25:19.956 --> 25:23.039
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.497
If only he hadn't
taunted him.

25:25.498 --> 25:29.456
He could've walked away
and left poor Ser Gregor to die.

25:29.457 --> 25:31.497
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

25:31.498 --> 25:34.331
Now he's buried
somewhere.

25:34.332 --> 25:37.080
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

25:37.081 --> 25:38.998
That must be
difficult for you.

25:42.956 --> 25:44.955
When my daughter
was taken from me,

25:44.956 --> 25:48.080
my only daughter...

25:48.081 --> 25:50.872
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

25:50.873 --> 25:53.122
unless you've
lost a child.

25:53.123 --> 25:55.788
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

25:55.789 --> 25:58.497
to give her
to the wet nurse.

25:58.498 --> 26:01.997
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

26:01.998 --> 26:04.247
I never got
to have a mother,

26:04.248 --> 26:05.663
but Myrcella did.

26:05.664 --> 26:09.331
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

26:09.332 --> 26:11.373
Why did you do that?

26:17.956 --> 26:19.332
Doesn't matter now.

26:27.915 --> 26:30.663
Your daughter's
a beauty, too.

26:30.664 --> 26:33.289
Those brown eyes.

26:33.290 --> 26:34.998
Those lips.

26:36.623 --> 26:38.663
Perfect Dornish beauty.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.538
I imagine
she's your favorite.

26:40.539 --> 26:43.705
I know, I know,
we're not supposed to have favorites,

26:43.706 --> 26:45.873
but still,
we're only human.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.955
We love whom we love.

26:51.831 --> 26:53.830
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

26:53.831 --> 26:57.206
That gag makes it impossible
to understand what you're saying.

26:57.207 --> 26:59.040
It must be frustrating.

27:02.207 --> 27:05.206
We all make
our choices.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.622
You chose to murder
my daughter.

27:07.623 --> 27:09.872
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

27:09.873 --> 27:12.081
Do you feel powerful now?

27:18.664 --> 27:20.039
I don't sleep very well.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.414
Not at all, really.

27:22.415 --> 27:24.331
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

27:24.332 --> 27:26.705
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

27:26.706 --> 27:30.581
How to destroy Ellaria Sand,
the woman who murdered my only daughter.

27:32.081 --> 27:33.747
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

27:33.748 --> 27:35.914
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

27:35.915 --> 27:40.622
It would be poetic, I suppose,
but fast, too fast.

27:40.623 --> 27:43.581
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.415
She's so beautiful.

27:47.664 --> 27:49.331
The thought
of this lovely face

27:49.332 --> 27:51.747
cracking open
like a duck egg,

27:51.748 --> 27:53.498
no, it's just not right.

28:00.956 --> 28:02.080
Mama.

28:12.457 --> 28:14.788
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

28:14.789 --> 28:17.872
Clever enough to learn
what poison you used to murder Myrcella.

28:17.873 --> 28:19.538
The Long Goodbye,
was that it?

28:19.539 --> 28:21.623
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

28:25.956 --> 28:27.456
How long does
the poison take?

28:27.457 --> 28:30.122
Difficult to say--
hours, days.

28:30.123 --> 28:31.997
It depends
on the subject's constitution.

28:31.998 --> 28:35.498
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

28:40.873 --> 28:43.747
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

28:43.748 --> 28:46.872
and you will be here
watching when she does.

28:46.873 --> 28:49.664
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

28:51.539 --> 28:55.497
If you refuse to eat,
we'll force food down your throat.

28:55.498 --> 28:59.206
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

28:59.207 --> 29:02.497
To watch that beautiful face collapse...

29:02.498 --> 29:04.623
...to bone and dust.

29:06.998 --> 29:09.956
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.663
Make sure the guards
change the torches every few hours.

29:15.664 --> 29:17.081
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

29:48.081 --> 29:49.332
No.

30:31.581 --> 30:32.581
Don't.

30:44.623 --> 30:47.456
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

30:47.457 --> 30:51.123
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

30:56.664 --> 30:57.788
Forgive me, Your Grace.

30:57.789 --> 31:00.122
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

31:00.123 --> 31:03.122
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

31:03.123 --> 31:04.457
At once, Your Grace.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.705
No, thank you.

31:17.706 --> 31:19.414
My condolences,
Your Grace,

31:19.415 --> 31:21.372
on the death
of your son.

31:21.373 --> 31:24.080
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

31:24.081 --> 31:26.830
The Iron Bank didn't send you here
to offer condolences.

31:26.831 --> 31:30.331
Condolences
and congratulations.

31:30.332 --> 31:33.289
To become the first ruling Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms,

31:33.290 --> 31:35.289
that's quite
an accomplishment.

31:35.290 --> 31:39.080
The Iron Bank appreciates
how you cast off the yoke of superstition,

31:39.081 --> 31:40.663
freeing the crown
from elements

31:40.664 --> 31:43.164
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

31:43.165 --> 31:46.331
The destruction of the Sept of Baelor
was a tragic accident.

31:46.332 --> 31:50.538
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

31:50.539 --> 31:52.914
to restore order
and rational leadership.

31:52.915 --> 31:55.663
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.247
Your father never
minced words either.

31:58.248 --> 32:02.080
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

32:02.081 --> 32:04.955
And you're now engaged in a conflict
on several fronts.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.872
We both know
how expensive war can be.

32:07.873 --> 32:10.080
And we both know
gold wins wars.

32:10.081 --> 32:11.538
Your vaults are empty.

32:11.539 --> 32:14.039
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

32:14.040 --> 32:17.372
Your wealthiest allies,
the Tyrells, are now your enemies.

32:17.373 --> 32:20.955
You are surrounded
on all sides by rivals for the throne.

32:20.956 --> 32:22.914
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

32:22.915 --> 32:24.622
We don't make bets.

32:24.623 --> 32:28.206
We invest in endeavors
we deem likely to be successful.

32:28.207 --> 32:31.164
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

32:31.165 --> 32:34.914
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

32:34.915 --> 32:37.914
I decapitated
the Dornish snake.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.955
My armada owns
the Narrow Sea.

32:39.956 --> 32:42.414
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

32:42.415 --> 32:43.914
Euron Greyjoy
is loyal to me.

32:43.915 --> 32:46.122
For now.

32:46.123 --> 32:49.872
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

32:49.873 --> 32:54.206
How well do wooden ships fare against
fire-breathing dragons?

32:54.207 --> 32:59.247
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

32:59.248 --> 33:01.622
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

33:01.623 --> 33:03.538
You want to
invest in her?

33:03.539 --> 33:07.914
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

33:07.915 --> 33:10.164
How are your profits

33:10.165 --> 33:12.705
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

33:12.706 --> 33:16.872
The slave trade has
entered a downturn, it's true.

33:16.873 --> 33:18.747
From what I gather,
she considers herself

33:18.748 --> 33:22.080
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

33:22.081 --> 33:25.997
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

33:25.998 --> 33:28.997
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank
quite a lot of money,

33:28.998 --> 33:31.164
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

33:31.165 --> 33:35.581
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

33:39.165 --> 33:41.164
Your father's daughter,
indeed.

33:41.165 --> 33:42.497
Give me a fortnight.

33:42.498 --> 33:44.705
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

33:44.706 --> 33:46.122
And when you
return to Braavos,

33:46.123 --> 33:50.581
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

34:14.206 --> 34:18.040
I came down here to brood over
my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

34:20.581 --> 34:22.121
You're making it
difficult.

34:22.123 --> 34:25.789
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.039
You make me feel like
I'm failing at brooding over failing.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.746
I'm a prisoner
on this island.

34:31.748 --> 34:35.705
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.206
You're free
to walk the castle,

34:37.206 --> 34:39.121
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

34:39.123 --> 34:41.289
Except to my ship.

34:41.290 --> 34:42.705
You took my ship.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.663
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

34:44.664 --> 34:47.164
I'm not playing
word games with you.

34:47.165 --> 34:49.039
The dead are coming
for us all.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.705
Why don't you
figure out what to do

34:50.706 --> 34:52.788
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

34:52.789 --> 34:55.663
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

34:55.664 --> 34:57.872
It's hard for me to fathom.
It really is.

34:57.873 --> 35:00.998
If someone told me about the white walkers
and the Night King...

35:08.415 --> 35:09.664
You probably
don't believe me.

35:12.123 --> 35:14.289
I do, actually.

35:14.290 --> 35:15.831
You didn't before.

35:17.539 --> 35:19.747
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

35:19.748 --> 35:21.830
Do you remember?

35:21.831 --> 35:23.914
You said
it was all nonsense.

35:23.915 --> 35:27.039
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

35:27.040 --> 35:30.164
But then Mormont
saw them

35:30.165 --> 35:31.580
and you saw them.

35:31.581 --> 35:33.247
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

35:33.248 --> 35:35.248
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

35:36.581 --> 35:38.830
How do I convince people
who don't know me

35:38.831 --> 35:41.580
that an enemy they don't believe in
is coming to kill them all?

35:41.581 --> 35:44.914
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

35:44.915 --> 35:47.080
I'm looking
for an answer.

35:47.081 --> 35:51.372
People's minds aren't made for
problems that large.

35:51.373 --> 35:53.830
White walkers,
the Night King,

35:53.831 --> 35:55.914
Army of the Dead--

35:55.915 --> 35:57.538
it's almost a relief
to confront

35:57.539 --> 36:00.415
a comfortable,
familiar monster like my sister.

36:02.748 --> 36:05.706
I need to help prepare my people
for what's coming.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.748
I can't help them
from here.

36:11.248 --> 36:12.498
I'd like to leave.

36:13.956 --> 36:16.456
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

36:16.457 --> 36:18.123
by giving up
that easily.

36:20.290 --> 36:23.414
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.206
Don't go south.

36:25.207 --> 36:27.872
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

36:27.873 --> 36:29.290
a foreign invader.

36:31.664 --> 36:34.372
And here I am,

36:34.373 --> 36:35.914
a Northern fool.

36:35.915 --> 36:38.372
Children are not
their fathers,

36:38.373 --> 36:40.081
luckily
for all of us.

36:41.581 --> 36:43.788
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

36:43.789 --> 36:45.997
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

36:45.998 --> 36:50.206
Daenerys could have sailed
for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

36:50.207 --> 36:52.039
Instead, she stayed
where she was

36:52.040 --> 36:54.705
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

36:54.706 --> 36:57.039
some of whom are on this island
with us right now.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.622
While you're
our guest here,

36:58.623 --> 37:00.164
you might consider
asking them

37:00.165 --> 37:02.914
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

37:02.915 --> 37:05.997
She protects people
from monsters,

37:05.998 --> 37:07.538
just as you do.

37:07.539 --> 37:09.997
It's why she came here.

37:09.998 --> 37:11.538
And she's not about
to head north

37:11.539 --> 37:12.997
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

37:12.998 --> 37:15.497
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

37:15.498 --> 37:17.914
After a single meeting,

37:17.915 --> 37:20.706
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

37:27.081 --> 37:29.332
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

37:34.165 --> 37:35.331
What do you mean?

37:35.332 --> 37:37.580
Maybe you are
a Northern fool.

37:37.581 --> 37:41.248
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

37:44.207 --> 37:45.747
- Dragonglass?
- Yes.

37:45.748 --> 37:48.206
Volcanic glass,
obsidian.

37:48.207 --> 37:50.206
He says you have
a tremendous amount of it here.

37:50.207 --> 37:51.997
Why are we talking
about glass?

37:51.998 --> 37:53.872
We just lost
two of our allies.

37:53.873 --> 37:57.248
Which is why I was
speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

37:59.623 --> 38:03.372
And what does the King in the North
want with dragonglass?

38:03.373 --> 38:05.705
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

38:05.706 --> 38:08.830
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

38:08.831 --> 38:10.997
Or stop them.

38:10.998 --> 38:12.289
Destroy them.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.915
Unsure about
the nomenclature.

38:15.873 --> 38:18.830
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

38:18.831 --> 38:21.705
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

38:21.706 --> 38:24.331
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

38:24.332 --> 38:27.580
But a wise man once said
that you should never believe a thing

38:27.581 --> 38:30.123
simply because
you want to believe it.

38:32.831 --> 38:35.997
Which wise man
said this?

38:35.998 --> 38:37.872
I don't remember.

38:37.873 --> 38:41.290
Are you trying to present
your own statements as ancient wisdom?

38:42.498 --> 38:44.705
I would never do that.

38:44.706 --> 38:45.748
To you.

38:47.581 --> 38:51.247
The reason I believe Jon Snow
is because he's here.

38:51.248 --> 38:53.663
All of his advisors
would have told him not to come.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.747
I would have told him
not to come.

38:55.748 --> 38:58.080
And he's here anyway.

38:58.081 --> 39:00.497
You don't
have to believe him.

39:00.498 --> 39:02.538
Let him mine
the dragonglass.

39:02.539 --> 39:04.164
If he's wrong,
it's worthless.

39:04.165 --> 39:06.247
You didn't even know
it was here.

39:06.248 --> 39:08.788
It's nothing to you.

39:08.789 --> 39:12.080
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

39:12.081 --> 39:14.788
Take a step toward
a more productive relationship

39:14.789 --> 39:17.372
with a possible ally.

39:17.373 --> 39:20.747
Keep him occupied
while we focus on the task at hand--

39:20.748 --> 39:22.123
Casterly Rock.

39:23.373 --> 39:25.164
What was that
Ser Davos said

39:25.165 --> 39:29.206
about taking a knife in the heart
for his people?

39:29.207 --> 39:30.997
Did you notice that?

39:30.998 --> 39:33.456
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

39:33.457 --> 39:35.623
It's dreary
in the North.

39:51.498 --> 39:52.998
Amazing thing
to see.

39:54.498 --> 39:57.539
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.165
They're both gone now.

40:02.457 --> 40:03.831
You lost
two brothers as well.

40:06.998 --> 40:09.873
People thought dragons
were gone forever, but here they are.

40:11.623 --> 40:14.457
Perhaps we should all be examining
what we think we know.

40:20.415 --> 40:22.705
You've been talking
to Tyrion.

40:22.706 --> 40:25.456
He is my Hand.

40:25.457 --> 40:28.081
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

40:29.539 --> 40:31.040
I don't.

40:36.040 --> 40:39.039
You know I'm not going to let Cersei
stay on the Iron Throne.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.206
I never expected
that you would.

40:40.207 --> 40:41.456
And I haven't
changed my mind

40:41.457 --> 40:43.538
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

40:43.539 --> 40:45.373
I haven't either.

40:54.706 --> 40:58.914
I will allow you to mine the dragonglass
and forge weapons from it.

40:58.915 --> 41:01.915
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

41:05.415 --> 41:06.415
Thank you.

41:12.915 --> 41:16.581
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

41:19.748 --> 41:22.457
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

41:47.123 --> 41:48.747
How much do we have?

41:48.748 --> 41:50.830
4,000 bushels,
my lady.

41:50.831 --> 41:51.997
What does
that mean?

41:51.998 --> 41:54.080
For the current
occupants of the castle,

41:54.081 --> 41:57.747
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

41:57.748 --> 42:01.164
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

42:01.165 --> 42:03.622
Uh, I'm not
entirely certain.

42:03.623 --> 42:05.456
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

42:05.457 --> 42:08.955
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

42:08.956 --> 42:11.080
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

42:11.081 --> 42:14.290
especially not if the armies of the North
come back to defend Winterfell?

42:15.539 --> 42:17.788
No, my lady,
most likely not.

42:17.789 --> 42:19.914
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

42:19.915 --> 42:21.997
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

42:21.998 --> 42:24.289
this is
the best place to be.

42:24.290 --> 42:26.247
We need to start
building up our grain stores

42:26.248 --> 42:28.830
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

42:28.831 --> 42:31.122
If we don't use it by winter's end,
we'll give it back to them.

42:31.123 --> 42:33.456
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

42:33.457 --> 42:37.164
they won't have enough time
to bring wagonloads of grain with them.

42:37.165 --> 42:38.580
Very wise, my lady.

42:38.581 --> 42:40.373
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

42:44.165 --> 42:46.663
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

42:46.664 --> 42:48.039
No, my lady.

42:48.040 --> 42:51.122
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

42:51.123 --> 42:52.538
They should, indeed.

42:52.539 --> 42:54.747
Pardon me, my lady.

42:54.748 --> 42:57.332
You there, why isn't there
leather on these?

42:59.332 --> 43:01.123
Command suits you.

43:02.831 --> 43:04.914
The Northerners
are all facing north,

43:04.915 --> 43:06.997
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

43:06.998 --> 43:08.538
So they should be.

43:08.539 --> 43:11.206
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

43:11.207 --> 43:13.289
If you turn
your back on her--

43:13.290 --> 43:15.036
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

43:15.060 --> 43:17.060
I only meant to say--

43:17.207 --> 43:20.747
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

43:20.748 --> 43:22.831
Thank you for
your wise counsel.

43:24.123 --> 43:26.331
One of two things
will happen--

43:26.332 --> 43:28.622
either the dead
will defeat the living,

43:28.623 --> 43:30.580
in which case...

43:30.581 --> 43:32.663
all our troubles
come to an end,

43:32.664 --> 43:35.039
or life will win out.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.039
And what then?

43:37.040 --> 43:41.040
Don't fight
in the North or the South.

43:42.623 --> 43:47.498
Fight every battle,
everywhere, always, in your mind.

43:49.415 --> 43:51.289
Everyone is your enemy,

43:51.290 --> 43:54.206
everyone
is your friend...

43:54.207 --> 43:58.331
every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

43:58.332 --> 44:01.914
Live that way
and nothing will surprise you.

44:01.915 --> 44:04.497
Everything that happens
will be something

44:04.498 --> 44:06.415
that you've seen before.

44:08.664 --> 44:11.415
Lady Sansa,
at the gate.

44:43.956 --> 44:45.123
Hello, Sansa.

45:05.998 --> 45:08.122
I wish Jon were here.

45:08.123 --> 45:10.998
Yes, I need
to speak to him.

45:15.165 --> 45:17.789
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

45:19.623 --> 45:22.497
You're Lord
of Winterfell now.

45:22.498 --> 45:25.747
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

45:25.748 --> 45:27.580
I can never be
lord of anything.

45:27.581 --> 45:28.831
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

45:30.915 --> 45:32.705
I don't know
what that means.

45:32.706 --> 45:35.122
It's difficult
to explain.

45:35.123 --> 45:37.332
Try.
Please, for me.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.997
It means I can see
everything.

45:41.998 --> 45:44.331
Everything that's
ever happened to everyone.

45:44.332 --> 45:47.331
Everything that's
happening right now.

45:47.332 --> 45:52.122
It's all pieces now,
fragments.

45:52.123 --> 45:54.331
I need to learn
to see better.

45:54.332 --> 45:57.747
When the Long Night
comes again,

45:57.748 --> 45:59.373
I need to be ready.

46:02.415 --> 46:04.830
How do you know
all this?

46:04.831 --> 46:06.372
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

46:06.373 --> 46:08.289
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

46:08.290 --> 46:11.039
I told you
it's difficult to explain.

46:13.207 --> 46:14.705
Bran--

46:14.706 --> 46:17.080
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

46:17.081 --> 46:21.081
I'm sorry it had to happen
here in our home.

46:26.290 --> 46:28.373
It was so beautiful
that night.

46:30.373 --> 46:34.373
Snow falling,
just like now.

46:37.623 --> 46:39.457
And you were
so beautiful...

46:41.415 --> 46:43.207
in your white
wedding dress.

46:47.081 --> 46:48.956
I have to go
back inside, Bran.

46:50.332 --> 46:52.040
I'll stay
a bit longer.

47:05.748 --> 47:07.290
Hmm.

47:15.789 --> 47:17.623
Hmm.

47:23.081 --> 47:24.955
Does it hurt?

47:24.956 --> 47:27.664
A bit.
Less than before.

47:29.457 --> 47:32.080
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

47:33.664 --> 47:35.497
Unusual.

47:35.498 --> 47:36.955
Unlikely.

47:36.956 --> 47:38.955
One could almost
be forgiven

47:38.956 --> 47:42.538
for thinking that the entire upper layer
of diseased skin was debrided

47:42.539 --> 47:46.914
and the underlying region
treated with some sort of unguent.

47:46.915 --> 47:50.206
Don't know
anything about that.

47:50.207 --> 47:52.289
I just started
feeling better.

47:52.290 --> 47:55.956
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

47:57.915 --> 48:00.538
And the climate.

48:00.539 --> 48:02.497
The climate.

48:02.498 --> 48:04.289
You're free
to go, ser.

48:04.290 --> 48:06.331
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

48:06.332 --> 48:08.039
which you are
no longer.

48:08.040 --> 48:11.539
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you
in my study this evening.

48:14.498 --> 48:15.789
How bad is it?

48:17.457 --> 48:18.831
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

48:23.956 --> 48:26.663
Where will you go?

48:26.664 --> 48:30.373
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

48:31.831 --> 48:34.663
I knew
it would kill me

48:34.664 --> 48:37.331
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

48:37.332 --> 48:40.580
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

48:40.581 --> 48:44.206
The only place for me
is back with her.

48:44.207 --> 48:46.622
I owe her my life.

48:46.623 --> 48:49.206
Her and you.

48:51.415 --> 48:53.747
Your father saved me
more than once.

48:53.748 --> 48:55.539
It's the least
I could do.

48:57.040 --> 49:00.414
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

49:00.415 --> 49:01.831
I hope they do.

49:28.956 --> 49:29.941
You treated him?

49:29.965 --> 49:31.418
Yes.

49:32.415 --> 49:34.914
Who told you
to treat him?

49:34.915 --> 49:36.247
No one.

49:36.248 --> 49:39.538
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

49:39.539 --> 49:42.247
I seem
to remember you.

49:42.248 --> 49:45.081
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

49:46.748 --> 49:49.872
I forbade it because it is dangerous
and rarely successful,

49:49.873 --> 49:52.206
especially on
someone of that age.

49:52.207 --> 49:54.414
You could have infected
yourself and others.

49:54.415 --> 49:57.873
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

50:00.165 --> 50:02.080
But you didn't.

50:02.081 --> 50:04.705
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

50:04.706 --> 50:08.122
Many maesters whose chains are
heavy with healing links

50:08.123 --> 50:10.580
have attempted it
and failed.

50:10.581 --> 50:12.663
Yet you succeeded.

50:12.664 --> 50:13.789
How?

50:15.789 --> 50:19.081
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

50:29.457 --> 50:31.664
That man is alive
because of you.

50:33.956 --> 50:35.581
You should be proud.

50:38.664 --> 50:41.164
Thank you,
Archmaester.

50:41.165 --> 50:42.165
Come here.

50:46.123 --> 50:49.788
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

50:49.789 --> 50:52.457
I need you
to make copies of them.

50:56.748 --> 50:58.831
You were expecting
a reward.

51:00.539 --> 51:04.332
Your reward is not being
immediately expelled from the Citadel.

51:05.498 --> 51:07.497
You'd better
get started.

51:07.498 --> 51:09.164
And careful
of the paper mites.

51:09.165 --> 51:10.498
They like flesh
as well.

51:17.748 --> 51:21.122
We need to find
Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

51:21.123 --> 51:24.622
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

51:24.623 --> 51:26.164
To send our
remaining ships after him--

51:26.165 --> 51:28.831
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

51:32.664 --> 51:34.206
Would you have to go
yourself?

51:34.207 --> 51:36.206
Euron's ships
could be anywhere

51:36.207 --> 51:38.206
or in more than
one place.

51:38.207 --> 51:40.622
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

51:40.623 --> 51:41.663
for who knows
how long.

51:41.664 --> 51:43.289
I wouldn't be alone.

51:43.290 --> 51:45.872
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

51:45.873 --> 51:47.663
What can anyone
do to them?

51:47.664 --> 51:49.663
They can still
do something to you.

51:49.664 --> 51:51.456
It only takes
one arrow.

51:51.457 --> 51:53.998
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

51:56.332 --> 51:58.456
What about
Casterly Rock?

51:58.457 --> 52:00.414
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

52:00.415 --> 52:02.997
And what will they face?

52:02.998 --> 52:05.414
A difficult situation.

52:05.415 --> 52:07.538
They know we're coming.

52:07.539 --> 52:10.872
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

52:10.873 --> 52:12.497
is to destroy
House Lannister.

52:12.498 --> 52:14.248
She will be ready.

52:18.248 --> 52:20.872
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- Archers!

52:20.873 --> 52:23.247
The Lannister Army
is still the army my father built.

52:23.248 --> 52:25.580
- Come on!
- Well-trained and well-provisioned.

52:25.581 --> 52:27.372
10,000 men at least.

52:27.373 --> 52:28.373
They will see us coming.

52:32.915 --> 52:34.580
They will be ready.

52:37.873 --> 52:39.915
- Draw! Loose!
- Loose!

52:42.123 --> 52:45.248
The gates of Casterly Rock
are impregnable.

52:52.956 --> 52:55.206
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

52:55.207 --> 52:56.748
We will be
at a disadvantage.

52:58.123 --> 52:59.789
Many men will die.

53:01.956 --> 53:03.998
Just as my father
said they would.

53:06.165 --> 53:08.788
Interesting thing
about my father--

53:08.789 --> 53:10.705
he built our house up
from near ruin.

53:10.706 --> 53:14.872
He built our army,
he built Casterly Rock as we know it,

53:14.873 --> 53:16.955
but he didn't
build the sewers.

53:16.956 --> 53:19.039
That was beneath him,

53:19.040 --> 53:21.914
so he gave the job
to the lowest person he could find--

53:21.915 --> 53:23.456
me.

53:23.457 --> 53:25.289
He was right,
I was low.

53:25.290 --> 53:27.414
The company I kept, low.

53:27.415 --> 53:28.955
Women, mostly.

53:28.956 --> 53:30.622
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

53:30.623 --> 53:32.914
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

53:32.915 --> 53:34.538
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

53:34.539 --> 53:35.997
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

53:35.998 --> 53:38.247
so in the process
of building the sewers,

53:38.248 --> 53:40.998
I threw in something
for myself.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.039
It was a passage
that began

53:45.040 --> 53:46.747
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

53:46.748 --> 53:50.164
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

53:50.165 --> 53:53.373
No better place for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

53:54.998 --> 53:58.747
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

54:00.998 --> 54:04.663
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

54:04.664 --> 54:08.622
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

54:14.165 --> 54:15.373
And so it begins.

54:22.123 --> 54:24.997
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

54:24.998 --> 54:26.872
They will be outnumbered.

54:26.873 --> 54:29.207
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

54:34.165 --> 54:37.955
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

54:37.956 --> 54:40.914
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

54:40.915 --> 54:42.914
They will be fighting
for freedom

54:42.915 --> 54:44.705
and the person
who gave it to them.

54:44.706 --> 54:47.206
They will be fighting
for you.

54:47.207 --> 54:49.664
And that is why
they will triumph.

55:36.415 --> 55:37.622
Where are they?!

55:37.623 --> 55:40.248
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

57:09.123 --> 57:11.373
- It's done.
- It is.

57:13.248 --> 57:17.373
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

57:19.706 --> 57:21.164
Did we fight well?

57:21.165 --> 57:24.206
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

57:24.207 --> 57:26.331
It was never our forte.

57:26.332 --> 57:28.415
Golden roses, indeed.

57:30.332 --> 57:32.372
Your brother
and his new queen

57:32.373 --> 57:35.289
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

57:35.290 --> 57:38.580
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

57:38.581 --> 57:40.164
Well, it is to me,

57:40.165 --> 57:42.497
but my fond
childhood memories

57:42.498 --> 57:44.039
won't keep Cersei
on the throne.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.164
So you just
let them take it?

57:46.165 --> 57:48.206
For now.
They won't be able to hold it.

57:48.207 --> 57:50.747
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

57:50.748 --> 57:52.747
we emptied the larders
before we left.

57:52.748 --> 57:54.997
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

57:54.998 --> 57:58.414
and march all the way
across Westeros.

57:58.415 --> 58:01.580
And you took your army,
your real army,

58:01.581 --> 58:03.456
and went
where they weren't.

58:03.457 --> 58:06.788
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

58:06.789 --> 58:08.830
There are always
lessons in failures.

58:08.831 --> 58:12.415
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

58:13.706 --> 58:16.580
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

58:16.581 --> 58:18.331
If he was so clever,

58:18.332 --> 58:20.080
why didn't he take
Highgarden

58:20.081 --> 58:23.788
the moment
your gold mines ran dry?

58:25.332 --> 58:29.247
I suppose I'll be able
to ask him myself soon enough.

58:29.248 --> 58:32.332
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

58:34.789 --> 58:37.289
How will you do it?

58:37.290 --> 58:39.747
With that sword?

58:39.748 --> 58:42.122
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

58:42.123 --> 58:44.456
Not that
he ever used it.

58:44.457 --> 58:46.123
What did he call it?

58:47.748 --> 58:50.080
Widow's Wail.

58:50.081 --> 58:52.290
He really was a cunt,
wasn't he?

58:53.915 --> 58:59.289
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

58:59.290 --> 59:03.331
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

59:03.332 --> 59:06.497
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

59:06.498 --> 59:08.538
They were necessary.

59:08.539 --> 59:10.580
And whatever
I imagined necessary

59:10.581 --> 59:14.497
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

59:14.498 --> 59:19.123
But your sister
has done things...

59:20.789 --> 59:23.122
I was incapable
of imagining.

59:23.123 --> 59:25.955
That was
my prize mistake--

59:25.956 --> 59:28.498
a failure
of imagination.

59:29.831 --> 59:32.289
She's a monster,
you do know that?

59:32.290 --> 59:34.456
To you, I'm sure.

59:34.457 --> 59:36.331
To others as well.

59:36.332 --> 59:39.830
But after we've won
and there's no one left to oppose us,

59:39.831 --> 59:44.164
when people are living peacefully
in the world she built,

59:44.165 --> 59:47.873
do you really think they'll wring their hands
over the way she built it?

59:50.290 --> 59:52.497
You love her.

59:52.498 --> 59:54.289
You really do
love her.

59:54.290 --> 59:56.747
You poor fool.

59:56.748 --> 59:58.497
She'll be
the end of you.

59:58.498 --> 01:00:01.039
Possibly.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.830
Not much
to be gained

01:00:02.831 --> 01:00:04.872
from discussing it
with you, though, is there?

01:00:04.873 --> 01:00:07.580
What better person
to discuss it with?

01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:09.497
What better guarantee
could you have

01:00:09.498 --> 01:00:13.538
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

01:00:13.539 --> 01:00:16.580
But perhaps
you're right.

01:00:16.581 --> 01:00:18.164
If she's driven you
this far,

01:00:18.165 --> 01:00:20.581
it's gone beyond
your control.

01:00:21.873 --> 01:00:23.872
Yes.

01:00:23.873 --> 01:00:25.332
It has.

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:28.456
She's a disease.

01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:31.414
I regret my role
in spreading it.

01:00:31.415 --> 01:00:32.997
You will, too.

01:00:32.998 --> 01:00:34.748
I think
we're done here.

01:00:38.165 --> 01:00:39.207
How will it happen?

01:00:40.748 --> 01:00:42.663
Cersei had
several ideas.

01:00:42.664 --> 01:00:44.080
Whipping you
through the streets

01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:46.747
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

01:00:46.748 --> 01:00:50.581
Flaying you alive and hanging you from
the walls of King's Landing.

01:00:53.748 --> 01:00:55.539
I talked her
out of those.

01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:14.206
Will there be pain?

01:01:14.207 --> 01:01:16.788
No. I made sure
of that.

01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:18.123
That's good.

01:01:30.915 --> 01:01:32.915
I'd hate to die
like your son.

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:35.580
Clawing at my neck,

01:01:35.581 --> 01:01:38.456
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

01:01:38.457 --> 01:01:42.289
eyes bloodred,
skin purple.

01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:44.663
Must have been
horrible for you,

01:01:44.664 --> 01:01:48.122
as a Kingsguard,
as a father.

01:01:48.123 --> 01:01:50.705
It was horrible
enough for me.

01:01:50.706 --> 01:01:53.372
A shocking scene.

01:01:53.373 --> 01:01:56.165
Not at all
what I intended.

01:01:58.123 --> 01:02:02.706
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

01:02:07.664 --> 01:02:09.830
Tell Cersei.

01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:12.290
I want her to know
it was me.

01:03:56.075 --> 01:03:57.616
My only venture at this moment

01:03:57.617 --> 01:04:00.241
is reestablishing control
over this continent

01:04:00.242 --> 01:04:01.784
and every person on it.

01:04:03.951 --> 01:04:05.449
All my allies are gone.

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:06.450
I'm losing.

01:04:07.033 --> 01:04:10.158
You can count on the Iron Bank.
As soon as the gold arrives.

01:04:10.867 --> 01:04:12.742
Enough with the clever plans.
