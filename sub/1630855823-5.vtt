I don't think I can go fishing tomorrow.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.432
You two go without me.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.600
Hi, Boss.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.977
I got a flat tire, so I'm stuck here.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.145
I apologize.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.293
I'll take full responsibility.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.308
Was it a call from the Chinese, Boss?

04:27.392 --> 04:30.520
Maybe you should call the Japanese too.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.564
Wait outside.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.278
Yes, Boss.

Yes, Boss.

Yes, sir.

joined hands with Jaegeon Group.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

05:27.910 --> 05:29.078
Hello, sir.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.750
Have you recently been asked
to handle a Mercedes with a flat tire?

05:34.876 --> 05:36.085
That one.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.463
I went to fix it,

05:38.546 --> 05:41.257
but the guy was so rude
and kept rushing me.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.886
This is the one.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.013
He must drive pretty aggressively.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.349
It's an unusual puncture.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.529
Is Seungho all right?

06:04.447 --> 06:06.074
Is Gicheul still in the hospital?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.494
Yes.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.121
Those fuckers will pay for what they did.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.709
Thanks.

06:19.545 --> 06:22.340
I was at the office
the whole time that day.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.133
I watched a video with him,

06:24.300 --> 06:26.761
and then at night,
we went to his bar and had drinks.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.097
We played pool before that.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.766
Right. We went to a billiard hall too.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.742
Don't move. Stay still.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.827
I'll call the nurse.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.375
Captain Seok is talking
with the doctors there,

06:57.917 --> 07:00.128
-so don't worry too...
-You're so irresponsible.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.381
You knew they were having a turf war
with Song Donghyuk's gang.

07:03.464 --> 07:08.428
But did you really have to
leave Junmo alone in there?

07:09.887 --> 07:11.973
Shouldn't you have taken some measures,

07:12.056 --> 07:14.183
like getting backup
or trying to mediate them?

07:15.059 --> 07:17.437
We can't predict every possible scenario.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.190
It's actually normal
to have unexpected situations arise.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.988
Yet after all that's happened,
you're going to push through with this.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.702
Did meeting with Jung Gicheul
help Junmo...

07:32.827 --> 07:36.330
I mean, did it actually help
with the investigation?

07:37.373 --> 07:39.834
If it did, let me help more actively.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.213
As long as I can get my husband
out without getting him hurt again,

07:45.047 --> 07:47.216
I'll meet Jung Gicheul
and play mind games...

07:47.300 --> 07:49.969
I'll do whatever it takes
to end this crazy operation!

07:57.643 --> 08:00.980
This is the second time
you've saved my life.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.568
I trust you now.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.408
Boss.

08:13.784 --> 08:14.785
In that case,

08:17.413 --> 08:18.998
can I have a cigarette?

08:27.632 --> 08:29.175
(IN JAPANESE) We didn't get the product?

08:29.550 --> 08:32.220
No, we didn't even get
to meet the Korean captain.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.680
Any word from them?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.266
No. His phone is turned off.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.978
The payment has been made
in advance, right?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.063
Yes, Boss.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.151
Keep trying to reach them.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.444
Yes, Boss.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.572
(IN KOREAN) About the fishing trip...

08:52.949 --> 08:54.325
Do you actually go fishing?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.537
In the middle of the night?

08:58.037 --> 08:59.914
At least the sailing part, yes.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.667
What for?

09:07.755 --> 09:10.424
Honestly, after all this,
I have the right to know too.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.553
Do you go out to sea
to do some kind of smuggling?

09:14.011 --> 09:15.263
You'll know in time.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.527
I think I know who it is though.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.279
Who is it, sir?

09:32.863 --> 09:34.490
Send all the boys back to Seoul

09:35.575 --> 09:38.411
and have everyone assemble
at 9:00 p.m. in the office.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.121
Every one of them.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.123
Yes, Boss.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.377
And before that, be clear to tell everyone

09:48.212 --> 09:50.673
we found out the rat
who sold out our gang to Jaegeon Group.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.011
And I'm going to punish him
in front of everyone.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.931
They're all alive, so don't worry.

Do you?

11:49.417 --> 11:50.626
It's me.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.045
What happened?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.213
On our way to the sea,

11:54.422 --> 11:56.340
Song Donghyuk's boys ambushed us.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.594
One of our members almost died.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.679
An ambush?

12:02.012 --> 12:04.265
That means those boys knew

12:04.473 --> 12:07.268
which route you took to the sea.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.902
I also just found out
that I'm under surveillance now.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.448
This means there's a rat

Do you have anything to say?

No.

You can make yourself
comfortable, you know.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.216
Hey, are you trying to be
like Chow Yun-fat or what?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.593
Wherever you go, there's a war.

to make them feel better.

who followed us that day.

37:34.460 --> 37:38.130
To be perfectly honest,
I'm a little scared.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.759
What if something bad happens
because of her?

37:42.218 --> 37:44.178
I just want you to keep in mind

37:44.804 --> 37:49.433
that you're about to start
something really dangerous.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.149
Well, some things are dangerous

37:59.110 --> 38:00.611
but worth trying, right?

38:03.739 --> 38:04.740
Right.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.034
True.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.495
Let's drink.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.783
Oh, hey.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.837
How have you been?

39:05.426 --> 39:06.510
(CRYING)

39:23.194 --> 39:24.195
Choi Jungbae.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.781
Yes, sir?

39:28.699 --> 39:29.700
Do you trust me?

39:37.249 --> 39:38.417
I trust you. I mean it.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.506
I trust you too.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.342
Jung Gicheul has started to trust me.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.677
From now on, whenever I get free time...

39:48.761 --> 39:52.139
Stop. Let's not talk about that now.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.936
I don't want to think about those things.

39:58.854 --> 39:59.855
Okay.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.691
I just want to think about us.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.569
Right.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.365
Your mother.

40:11.492 --> 40:12.827
Did the funeral go well?

40:18.207 --> 40:19.333
I'm sorry.

40:23.587 --> 40:24.713
How's your wound?

40:26.632 --> 40:27.675
Are you okay now?

40:29.427 --> 40:30.886
Yes, I'm okay.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.516
Eat up.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.321
(EFFORT GRUNT)

40:53.200 --> 40:55.327
You asshole.

40:58.914 --> 41:01.167
You're distracting me, you asshole.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.003
Think about it.

41:08.132 --> 41:13.846
Don't you think Gicheul is trusting
Seungho too much?

41:15.181 --> 41:16.182
What is it now?

41:16.265 --> 41:18.225
It kind of bothers me
that he's sending him

41:18.309 --> 41:20.936
to that important meeting and not us.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.065
You got some free time thanks to that.

41:28.402 --> 41:30.446
When he said "an urgent appointment,"

41:30.529 --> 41:32.656
he meant a date with the cop, right?

41:34.116 --> 41:35.159
(GRUNTS)

41:36.744 --> 41:38.787
Well, that kind of bothers me too.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.914
Right?

41:41.540 --> 41:43.709
Whatever. It's his fucking business.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.795
Let's mind our own.

41:55.304 --> 41:59.058
DOHYUNG: Yoon Wongil. An ex-convict
jailed for meth who went over to China.

41:59.975 --> 42:03.395
Please check if this Chinese guest is her.

42:04.188 --> 42:08.442
INCHEON COASTAL PASSENGER TERMINAL

42:19.370 --> 42:21.247
(WOMAN OVER PA) Dear passengers...

42:32.550 --> 42:33.592
Are you Mr. Jung's man?

42:34.176 --> 42:36.387
Yes, I am.

42:39.848 --> 42:41.141
(SIGHS)

42:41.934 --> 42:42.935
Let's go.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.827
I said we should go somewhere nice.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.539
I wanted to visit the church.
It's been a while.

43:03.872 --> 43:05.165
Is that okay with you?

43:05.249 --> 43:07.418
Of course, it is.

43:14.967 --> 43:15.968
Oh.

43:20.097 --> 43:21.515
It would be nice

43:21.974 --> 43:24.476
if your mother started
to attend church again.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.248
As far as I know,

43:46.874 --> 43:48.208
if you're from China,

43:48.334 --> 43:51.128
only Korean-Chinese
who are over 55 can enter Korea.

43:51.211 --> 43:54.381
So I didn't expect
to see someone so young.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.472
We don't do this kind of job unprepared.

44:02.806 --> 44:04.350
I didn't know you were Korean.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.020
No, you're right. I'm Korean-Chinese.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.525
I didn't know Mr. Jung would send
someone so innocent.

44:22.826 --> 44:26.205
Is the person you came with taking a taxi?

44:37.675 --> 44:39.551
And about the recent mishap...

44:39.635 --> 44:41.053
Let me apologize first.

44:41.929 --> 44:42.930
We are very sorry.

44:49.770 --> 44:50.813
Is it a Korean thing

44:52.189 --> 44:54.191
to have other people apologize for you?

44:59.196 --> 45:00.948
(IN MANDARIN) One makes a mistake,

45:02.074 --> 45:03.450
and someone else apologizes.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.378
(CLEARS THROAT)

45:28.350 --> 45:29.518
How interesting.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.378
(IN KOREAN) Please get some rest.

45:57.212 --> 45:58.255
Your name?

45:58.338 --> 45:59.798
I'm Kwon Seungho.

46:31.246 --> 46:32.247
(JUNMO SIGHS)

46:33.332 --> 46:35.250
They're Korean-Chinese.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.587
Their passports must be forged,
so there's no point in background checks.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.965
I wonder why they came to Korea.

46:43.091 --> 46:45.427
To deliver the stuff on land
since they couldn't on water?

46:46.178 --> 46:49.014
Customs clearance at Incheon
wouldn't be that easy to pass.

46:50.015 --> 46:51.183
It must be something else.

46:51.266 --> 46:52.518
So let's watch them for now.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.436
What are you doing here, by the way?

46:55.854 --> 46:57.648
Shouldn't you be with Jung Gicheul now?

46:57.731 --> 46:58.982
Let me take care of this.

47:01.151 --> 47:02.736
Jung Gicheul is

47:02.820 --> 47:04.404
with Inspector Yu now.

47:04.863 --> 47:07.699
Why is Euijeong meeting with him?

47:07.783 --> 47:10.994
Didn't you see what that bastard did
to her at the funeral?

47:11.245 --> 47:13.914
Since you got hurt,
she decided to continue helping us.

47:14.122 --> 47:15.207
So why...

47:16.208 --> 47:19.086
Why is Euijeong helping us now?

47:20.003 --> 47:22.256
God damn it, before deciding
something like that,

47:22.339 --> 47:24.341
shouldn't you have
at least asked me first?

47:24.675 --> 47:27.177
Things were urgent,
and we couldn't reach out.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.096
We couldn't just sit back and watch.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.932
-Inspector Yu must've felt the same.
-God damn it.

47:32.015 --> 47:35.310
She insisted she'd do
anything it took to help you.

47:39.314 --> 47:40.941
You trust her, don't you?

47:41.149 --> 47:42.609
Don't think too much into it.

47:43.443 --> 47:46.488
Thanks to her,
these potential Chinese drug producers

47:46.572 --> 47:47.906
are right before our eyes now.

47:47.990 --> 47:49.032
God damn it.

47:58.917 --> 47:59.960
Excuse me.
