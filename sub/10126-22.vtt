WEBVTT

00:22.100 --> 00:25.900
ERIC, THIS COLLEGE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING
FOR AN INTERVIEW...

00:25.900 --> 00:27.934
WHAT, BEACH STATE?

00:27.934 --> 00:30.500
YEAH. THIS IS, LIKE,
A REAL COLLEGE, RIGHT?

00:30.500 --> 00:33.200
UH, BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING
OVER THIS LETTER YOU GOT
FROM THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE,

00:33.200 --> 00:36.200
AND THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT
OF TYPOS IN IT.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.100
SHOW ME ONE.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.900
"YOURS TRULY,
THE BEAN OF ADMISSIONS."

00:40.900 --> 00:42.133
YEAH? SO?

00:42.133 --> 00:44.000
WELL, IT'S A VERY
DIFFICULT SCHOOL
TO GET INTO.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.133
THEY JUST DON'T
LET ANYBODY IN.

00:45.133 --> 00:47.300
OH, I AM SO PSYCHED
ABOUT THIS ROAD TRIP.

00:47.300 --> 00:51.233
BEACH STATE'S
BEEN RECRUITING ME
SINCE KINDERGARTEN.

00:51.233 --> 00:53.800
MY DAD'S GOOD FRIENDS
WITH THE BEAN.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.233
HAS ANYONE SEEN
TOPANGA YET?

00:56.233 --> 00:57.400
NO, AND SHE
BETTER HURRY, MAN,

00:57.400 --> 00:59.367
BECAUSE IF WE
GET THERE TOO LATE,
THE TIDE COMES IN,

00:59.367 --> 01:00.400
AND THEN YOU CAN'T
PARK ON CAMPUS.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.133
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:02.133 --> 01:03.967
WHY DON'T YOU HELP ME
LOAD THE CAR.
DROP THE UMBRELLA,

01:03.967 --> 01:05.033
GRAB MY BOOGIE BOARD.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.867
WELL,
THEY'RE MY RIDE.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.100
UH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.300
YOU. BACK UP.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.100
WE'RE OK WITH YOU GOING
OVERNIGHT WITH TOPANGA.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.200
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:14.200 --> 01:16.300
WE'RE CLEAR
ON THE SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.233
AH, INTERESTING.
A LITTLE CONCERN ON
THE PART OF THE PARENTS.

01:19.233 --> 01:23.934
YOU'RE WORRIED CORY
MAY GET A LITTLE
FREAKY THIS WEEKEND?

01:23.934 --> 01:25.967
ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO TOPANGA,

01:25.967 --> 01:27.133
I'LL KILL YOU.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.967
YOU LIKE HER
BETTER THAN ME.

01:32.133 --> 01:35.667
ERIC, I THINK IT'S FINE
THAT YOU LOOK
AT OTHER COLLEGES.

01:35.667 --> 01:38.500
I JUST HOPE
THAT YOU GIVE
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION

01:38.500 --> 01:39.033
TO PENNBROOK.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.567
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M PENNBROOK MATERIAL?

01:41.567 --> 01:42.967
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT
THAT HUGE CAMPUS,

01:42.967 --> 01:45.900
ALL THOSE 100-YEAR-OLD
BUILDINGS, ALL THOSE
SMART PEOPLE.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.133
I MEAN, I'D GET
TROUNCED THERE.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.867
WELL, IT WILL BE
A CHALLENGE,
BUT WHEN YOU GRADUATE,

01:51.867 --> 01:54.800
YOU'LL HAVE A DEGREE
THAT ACTUALLY MEANS
SOMETHING.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.667
I DON'T KNOW, MR. FEENY.
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW,

01:56.667 --> 01:59.400
BEACH STATE
SEEMS LIKE A SURE THING.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.800
YES, WELL...

02:00.800 --> 02:03.600
SOMETIMES A SURE THING
IS NOT THE BEST THING.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.400
BUT I KNOW YOU'LL DO
WHAT'S RIGHT.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.200
HEY.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.000
OK, YOU'RE HERE.
GREAT, WE CAN GO.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.900
ALL RIGHT, TOPANGA,
ALL PACKED AND
READY TO GO--

02:12.900 --> 02:16.400
EXCEPT YOU HAVE NO SUITCASE
AND NO SLEEPING BAG.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.900
WHY, MISS TOPANGA,
I AM FLATTERED

02:19.900 --> 02:22.467
AND MORE FLATTERED.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.367
CORY, I'M NOT GOING.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.300
AND LESS FLATTERED.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.967
MY AUNT WOULDN'T LET ME
SPEND THE NIGHT AWAY

02:29.967 --> 02:31.100
UNSUPERVISED.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.800
UNSUPERVISED?
I'LL BE THERE.

02:35.100 --> 02:35.800
THAT'S KIND OF
THE PROBLEM.

02:35.800 --> 02:40.100
SHE FEELS THAT,
AT OUR AGE,
IT MIGHT BE IMPROPER.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.500
LISTEN, TOPANGA,
WE ARE OLD ENOUGH

02:41.500 --> 02:44.133
TO MAKE THESE KIND
OF DECISIONS ON OUR OWN,

02:44.133 --> 02:45.200
AND NOW YOUR AUNT
COMES ALONG

02:45.200 --> 02:47.967
AND PUTS THE KIBOSH
ON THE WHOLE DEAL.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.100
I'M CALLING HER, OK?

02:49.100 --> 02:49.800
CORY?

02:49.800 --> 02:52.967
WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU THINK WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND?

02:54.200 --> 02:55.400
TOPANGA,
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,

02:55.400 --> 02:58.367
THERE'S A BEACH,
THERE'S A MOON,

02:58.367 --> 03:00.667
THERE'S YOU,
THERE'S ME.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.700
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T GO.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.400
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO LET YOUR AUNT

03:06.400 --> 03:10.800
GET IN THE WAY
OF US BEING TOGETHER
ALONE FOR A WEEKEND.

03:12.500 --> 03:16.000
WHY DOESN'T THIS MEAN
AS MUCH TO YOU
AS IT MEANS TO ME?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.500
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.667
I DON'T THINK IT'S
VERY FAIR, EITHER, OK?

03:25.934 --> 03:27.567
WHERE'S SHE GOING?

03:27.567 --> 03:28.500
NOT WITH US.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.767
OH, COOL, I CAN TAKE
MY LOUNGE CHAIR.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.400
SHH, SHH.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.300
AFTERNOON,
MRS. BLUTEMANN.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.767
<i>JA...</i>

03:55.767 --> 04:00.133
[GERMAN ACCENT]
IT IS ALWAYS GOOD AFTERNOON
WHEN THERE ARE NO BOYS.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.567
THERE ARE NO BOYS?

04:02.567 --> 04:06.300
OF COURSE THERE ARE
NO BOYS. THIS IS
A SORORITY HOUSE.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.567
<i>JA, </i>I AM SO SURE.

04:09.567 --> 04:10.834
UH, NOT TO BE A SNITCH,

04:10.834 --> 04:14.233
BUT I THINK
SOME OF THE PLEDGES
TRACKED IN DIRT AGAIN,

04:14.233 --> 04:15.400
AND...

04:15.400 --> 04:18.100
I THINK THEY HAD BOYS.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.900
BOY DIRT?

04:20.567 --> 04:22.867
NOT ON MY WATCH.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.133
ERIC.
[DOOR HITS]
OH!

04:33.367 --> 04:34.500
WOW.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.367
IT'S ALL COMING TRUE.

04:36.367 --> 04:37.900
WHAT IS?
MY FANTASY, COR.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.133
I'VE HAD
THIS EXACT DREAM,
LIKE, A MILLION TIMES.

04:41.133 --> 04:41.700
Mrs. Blutemann: BOY!

04:41.700 --> 04:43.567
Boy: I'M JUST
DELIVERING A PIZZA.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.300
LEAVE IT ON THE STOOP.

04:48.033 --> 04:49.200
OH...

04:49.200 --> 04:50.467
WHO WAS THAT?

04:50.467 --> 04:51.600
THE HOUSE MOM.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.400
SHE CATCHES YOU,
SHE'LL BOOT ME OUT
OF THE SORORITY.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.734
SEE, BOYS AREN'T
ALLOWED UPSTAIRS.

04:55.734 --> 04:59.600
Both: ESPECIALLY,
NOT IN THE BEDROOMS.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.300
HOW DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS
GOING TO SAY THAT?

05:01.300 --> 05:02.867
MY DREAM.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.400
IT'S EXACTLY MY DREAM.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.600
Both: I DON'T WANT
TO BE IN YOUR DREAMS.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.600
UH, JULIE, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.667
YEAH, IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.600
I APPRECIATE YOU
LETTING US STAY HERE.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.767
NO, I DO. I ALSO
APPRECIATE YOU LETTING
OUR FRIENDS STAY HERE.

05:17.767 --> 05:19.233
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING
TO KNOW WE'RE HERE.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.900
WOW, YOUR ROOMMATE'S
A PIG.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.000
UH, THAT'S MY SIDE.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
WOW, YOU'RE THE PIG.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.667
DON'T--DON'T SIT THERE.
MARY BETH WILL HAVE A COW.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.300
MY ROOMIE'S
A TOTAL NEAT-FREAK.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.667
SHE'S COOL WITH US
STAYING HERE,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

05:34.667 --> 05:35.367
MMM, PROBABLY NOT,

05:35.367 --> 05:38.000
BUT MARY'S ALWAYS
AT HER BOYFRIEND'S
PLACE, ANYWAY.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.500
Both: HE'S QUARTERBACK
OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.100
YOU KNOW, THIS DREAM THING
IS GETTING EERIE.

05:46.100 --> 05:49.033
HEY, COME ON, WHAT
DO YOU SAY WE WINDSURF
AROUND THE CAMPUS?

05:49.033 --> 05:49.767
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.367
HEY, GUYS, UH, HAVE FUN.

05:51.367 --> 05:55.100
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING
AND STAY AWAY FROM ME.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.567
CORY...

05:57.567 --> 05:59.600
WHY SO
DOWN IN THE MOUTH?

05:59.600 --> 06:02.100
WE'RE ALONE
IN A SORORITY, MAN.

06:02.100 --> 06:02.800
ALL GIRLS,
ALL THE TIME.

06:02.800 --> 06:08.133
WE ARE STANDING
IN THE FORBIDDEN ZONE
SURROUNDED BY WOMEN.

06:08.133 --> 06:08.867
YEAH, RIGHT.

06:08.867 --> 06:14.000
SURROUNDED BY WOMEN,
EXCEPT FOR THE ONE
THAT SHOULD BE HERE.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.767
OH, WELL, THIS IS CUTE.

06:16.767 --> 06:17.800
HEY, THANKS.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.834
SHAWN HUNTER,
AND YOU ARE...

06:19.834 --> 06:20.834
IGNORING YOU.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.300
MRS. BLUTEMANN!

06:22.300 --> 06:22.867
NO, NO, NO.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.900
MY BROTHER'S FRIENDS
WITH YOUR ROOMMATE.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.700
OH, WELL,
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.600
BOYS! MANY BOYS!

06:28.600 --> 06:29.100
Mrs. Blutemann:
NO BOYS!

06:29.100 --> 06:30.700
[WOMAN'S VOICE]
UH, MRS. BLUTEMANN,

06:30.700 --> 06:32.800
THEY MUST'VE CLIMBED OUT
THE WINDOW.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.567
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO US?
WE'RE INVITED GUESTS.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.200
AND I LOVE YOU.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.900
WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE?

06:41.900 --> 06:44.700
YOU KNOW, THIS MAY BE
MY FIRST TIME
IN A SORORITY HOUSE,

06:44.700 --> 06:47.700
BUT I'M DETECTING
A LITTLE BIT OF AN ATTITUDE.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.667
YOU GOT A NAME?

06:49.667 --> 06:51.600
YEAH...

06:51.600 --> 06:52.867
TROUBLE.

06:52.867 --> 06:54.767
ALL GUYS
ARE TROUBLE.

06:54.767 --> 06:57.700
WHY SHOULD YOU BE
ANY DIFFERENT?

06:57.700 --> 06:58.900
SHE JUST BROKE UP
WITH HER BOYFRIEND,

06:58.900 --> 07:00.600
YOU KNOW,
THE QUARTERBACK GUY.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.700
HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT?

07:01.700 --> 07:06.233
I DREAMED IT,
MISS "BIRTHMARK
ON HER TOCHUS."

07:06.900 --> 07:09.700
SHAWN, SHAWN,
GO EASY ON HER, OK?

07:09.700 --> 07:10.767
LISTEN, I'M--
I'M SORRY, OK?

07:10.767 --> 07:11.834
WITH WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

07:11.834 --> 07:13.000
YOU PROBABLY DON'T
NEED US TO DEAL WITH,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.600
BUT, DON'T WORRY, WE'LL BE
OUT OF YOUR WAY VERY SOON.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.700
YOU'RE A SENSITIVE GUY.

07:19.700 --> 07:23.567
YEAH, WELL, I WEAR A LOT
OF LIGHT COLORS, SO...

07:28.100 --> 07:30.033
UH, SHAWN CAN I
SEE YOU FOR A SECOND?

07:30.033 --> 07:34.000
UH, LISTEN, IN THIS, UH,
RECURRING DREAM,
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.900
UH, LET'S SEE.
I'M LEFT ALONE WITH
A BEAUTIFUL SORORITY GIRL.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.100
SHE JUST GOT DUMPED
BY HER BOYFRIEND.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.934
SHE'S NOT TOO FOND
OF MEN AT THE MOMENT,

07:39.934 --> 07:43.767
SO SHE WREAKS HAVOC ON ME,
EMOTIONALLY...

07:43.767 --> 07:45.834
AND PHYSICALLY.

07:45.834 --> 07:48.000
I SEE, AND YET,
THERE'S ONLY ONE DETAIL

07:48.000 --> 07:52.567
THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY,
UH, MESH WITH YOUR DREAM.

07:52.567 --> 07:53.900
WHAT'S THAT?

07:53.900 --> 07:56.400
THE SORORITY GIRL'S...

07:57.834 --> 08:00.667
STARING AT<i>ME.</i>

08:09.667 --> 08:11.500
THE REC ROOM.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.100
ALL RIGHT.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.767
WELL, LET'S SEE.
WE'VE BEEN WATER-SKIING,

08:13.767 --> 08:16.700
SNORKELING, UH, PLAYED
A LITTLE BEACH VOLLEYBALL.

08:16.700 --> 08:17.700
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE TAKE A BREAK

08:17.700 --> 08:19.967
AND SEE, LIKE, WHERE
THE LEARNING GOES ON?

08:19.967 --> 08:20.967
WELL, WE CAN
CHECK OUT THE LAB

08:20.967 --> 08:23.734
WHERE DR. HALBERSTRAM
WON THE NOBEL PRIZE

08:23.734 --> 08:26.000
FOR HIS CLONING
EXPERIMENTS.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.734
KIDDING!
DR. HALBERSTRAM'S
A WALRUS.

08:29.734 --> 08:31.000
OH.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.800
YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOT
TO BE MORE TO A SCHOOL
THAN JUST THE BEACH.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.100
ERIC, WHERE'S
THE PROBLEM?

08:36.100 --> 08:39.500
AFTER ALL THE HARD WORK
WE PUT IN AT JOHN ADAMS,

08:39.500 --> 08:41.600
THIS IS OUR REWARD.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.300
YEAH, BUT THEN WHAT?

08:42.300 --> 08:44.000
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
OUT IN THE REAL WORLD
FOR A YEAR.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.200
I KNOW THAT
TO MAKE IT OUT THERE,

08:45.200 --> 08:48.033
YOU GOT TO COME OUT
OF THIS PLACE WITH MORE
THAN JUST A GOOD TAN.

08:48.033 --> 08:49.767
WHAT ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT?

08:49.767 --> 08:54.500
THE REAL WORLD
IS, LIKE, 4 YEARS AWAY.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.500
HEY.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.500
YES.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.133
OH. OH, SO YOU WANT
YOUR THINGS BACK NOW?

09:06.133 --> 09:08.300
THAT'S--THAT'S FINE.
HERE ARE YOUR CDs.

09:08.300 --> 09:14.400
THEY'LL BE
ON THE FRONT LAWN WITH
YOUR TELEVISION SET!

09:17.934 --> 09:21.300
THAT WAS
MY SLEEPING BAG.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.867
CORY, WE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.000
I THINK THIS WOMAN
IS OUT OF SORTS.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.033
IN MY DREAM,
THIS IS THE PART
WHERE SHE TURNS AROUND,

09:33.033 --> 09:34.200
AND THE FIRST GUY
SHE SEES,

09:34.200 --> 09:37.734
SHE TRAPS IN HER
EVIL MAN-HATING WEB

09:37.734 --> 09:41.300
OF VENGEFUL SEXUALITY.

09:46.567 --> 09:47.600
GET OUT.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.367
OK.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.100
I WANT YOU TO STAY,

09:53.100 --> 09:56.033
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A SENSITIVE GUY, AND
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

09:56.033 --> 09:58.900
WELL, OK, BUT MAYBE
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.600
HE WANTS
TO DUMP ME?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.133
NO GREAT LOSS.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.100
I NEVER REALLY
MEANT ANYTHING
TO HIM, ANYWAY.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.300
HE NEVER REALLY
WANTED TO BE
WITH ME, SO...

10:05.300 --> 10:09.667
LISTEN, I--I KNOW
THAT CAN MAKE YOU
FEEL BAD, OK?

10:09.667 --> 10:10.300
I MEAN...

10:10.300 --> 10:12.133
MY GIRLFRIEND
WAS SUPPOSED TO COME
WITH ME THIS WEEKEND,

10:12.133 --> 10:14.400
AND AT THE LAST MINUTE,
SHE BAILED, YOU KNOW?

10:14.400 --> 10:18.867
I MEAN, I WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO
SPENDING TIME TOGETHER,

10:18.867 --> 10:21.834
BUT I GUESS SHE WASN'T.

10:21.834 --> 10:22.834
RELATIONSHIPS.

10:22.834 --> 10:23.934
YEAH, RELATIONSHIPS.

10:23.934 --> 10:25.867
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
SO COMPLICATED.

10:25.867 --> 10:26.900
HARDLY WORTH IT.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.200
I'M THROUGH WITH MEN.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.467
ME, TOO.

10:32.033 --> 10:33.400
SO...

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
YOU WANT TO PARTY?

10:44.467 --> 10:45.834
YOU WANT TO PARTY
OR WHAT?

10:45.834 --> 10:48.300
UH, MARY BETH, LET US BE
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR

10:48.300 --> 10:50.300
OF YOUR DEFINITION
OF, UH, PARTY,

10:50.300 --> 10:52.200
LEST WE SHOULD
SEND OUT INVITATIONS

10:52.200 --> 10:54.667
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
HIRE A CLOWN.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.300
AM I MAKING YOU
NERVOUS, CORY?

10:57.300 --> 10:58.300
NERVOUS? NO.

10:58.300 --> 11:01.567
NO, NOT IF THERE'S
GOING TO BE A CLOWN.

11:01.567 --> 11:02.734
NO CLOWNS.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.300
JUST YOU...

11:04.300 --> 11:06.700
AND ME.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.734
UH, AND CANDLES, HUH?

11:09.734 --> 11:13.300
YOU'RE--YOU'RE
LIGHTING CANDLES.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.467
AROMATHERAPY CANDLES.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.467
HERE.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.100
SMELL.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.200
MMM...

11:19.200 --> 11:21.667
CORN BREAD
AND PINE NEEDLES.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.600
ACTUALLY,
IT'S YLANG-YLANG
AND SANDALWOOD.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.300
SANDALWOOD OIL HELPS
STIMULATE THE MIND

11:28.300 --> 11:30.400
AND EXALTS CALM...

11:30.400 --> 11:31.667
AND REFLECTION.

11:31.667 --> 11:36.300
AND THE YLANG-YLANG?
WHAT DOES THAT STIMULATE?

11:38.100 --> 11:40.200
I...

11:42.400 --> 11:45.100
[ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING]

11:45.100 --> 11:46.300
OH, NO.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.033
UH, LISTEN, MARY BETH,

11:48.033 --> 11:49.800
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T
BE HERE DURING THIS,

11:49.800 --> 11:54.400
THE TIME OF
YOUR GREAT STIMULATION.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.100
[HUMS]

11:58.400 --> 12:01.033
I'M STUCK.

12:01.033 --> 12:03.734
UH, LISTEN, MARY BETH,
I AM VERY FLATTERED,

12:03.734 --> 12:05.900
BUT, UH, I DO HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND, YOU KNOW.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.100
HER NAME IS TOPANGA.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.000
TOPANGA?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.100
SOUNDS LIKE
A FREEWAY EXIT.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.133
WHAT, YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME?

12:13.133 --> 12:17.567
FINE, I'LL PROVE IT
TO YOU, OK?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.100
HI, MISS CURTIS?

12:22.100 --> 12:24.600
HI, IT'S ME, CORY.
IS TOPANGA THERE?

12:24.600 --> 12:25.233
UH--

12:25.233 --> 12:28.000
UH, NO, SHE CAN'T
CALL ME BACK.
I'M ON THAT TRIP.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.233
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
YOU WOULDN'T LET HER GO ON?

12:31.233 --> 12:35.967
UH, REALLY?
HUH, THAT'S WEIRD.

12:35.967 --> 12:38.100
NO.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.600
NO MESSAGE. BYE.

12:42.934 --> 12:44.400
TOPANGA LIED TO ME.

12:44.400 --> 12:50.600
SHE NEVER EVEN TOLD
HER AUNT ABOUT THE TRIP.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.133
HEY, THAT'S MINE.

12:53.133 --> 12:55.200
WELL, LOVE IS LOSS.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.400
SOUNDS LIKE SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO COME WITH YOU.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.400
YEAH, I KNOW. I MEAN,
SHE BLAMED IT ON HER AUNT,

13:00.400 --> 13:05.100
WHILE, THE WHOLE TIME,
IT WAS ME SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE ALONE WITH.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.233
I'D BE ALONE WITH YOU.

13:08.233 --> 13:11.100
LISTEN, YOU JUST BROKE UP
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND, OK?

13:11.100 --> 13:13.000
I JUST GOT IN A FIGHT
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.233
WE'RE BOTH
VERY VULNERABLE.

13:14.233 --> 13:15.667
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING
I'M GOING TO REGRET.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.400
CORY...

13:17.400 --> 13:19.200
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU WERE COUNTING
ON SPENDING SOME TIME

13:19.200 --> 13:21.500
WITH A WOMAN
THIS WEEKEND.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.567
IF YOU PASS THIS UP,

13:23.567 --> 13:25.967
YOU'LL REGRET IT.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.600
AND NOW THE STARTING LINEUP
FOR THE 1996 WORLD CHAMPION
NEW YORK YANKEES.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.300
AT FIRST, THE BIG MAN,
CECIL FIELDER. AT SECOND...

13:36.033 --> 13:39.800
I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

13:43.367 --> 13:47.667
I'M GOING TO GO
TAKE A SHOWER.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.300
SO THAT WAS IT?

13:52.300 --> 13:54.567
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.700
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.300
DON'T YOU GO ANYWHERE.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.800
[HUMS]

14:07.800 --> 14:10.800
OH, WELL, THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.500
OH, BOY.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.600
LOOK AT YOU.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.667
YOU LIKE THE WAY I LOOK?

14:19.667 --> 14:21.000
UH, YEAH.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.667
UH, OK, STAY THERE.
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.000
OK, 1, 2, 3,
RED LIGHT.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.600
SEE, NOW YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO LOSE THE GAME.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.667
NO, WE'RE BOTH
GOING TO WIN.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.467
UH...

14:37.467 --> 14:39.233
I CAN COUNTER THAT MOVE.

14:39.233 --> 14:42.300
SEE, I'M--I'M
ON THE WRESTLING TEAM,
SO I'LL JUST--

14:42.300 --> 14:45.000
SO AM I.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.834
SORRY.

14:46.834 --> 14:47.867
UH...

14:47.867 --> 14:49.900
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WERE--

14:49.900 --> 14:51.667
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY BROTHER?

14:51.667 --> 14:53.767
PRESENT.

14:53.767 --> 14:54.967
OK, UM...

14:54.967 --> 14:58.033
WELL, I'LL JUST
GET A FEW THINGS
AND BE ON MY WAY.

14:58.033 --> 15:00.100
LIKE YOU SEEM TO BE.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.767
UH, ERIC, LISTEN, THIS
ISN'T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

15:02.767 --> 15:05.767
OH, I KNOW, YOU WERE
JUST WRESTLING.

15:05.767 --> 15:08.600
UH, MARY BETH,
MY BROTHER'S HERE, OK?

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
THAT'S OK.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.767
UH, NOT FOR ME.

15:10.767 --> 15:13.934
COULD YOU MAYBE
GIVE US A MINUTE OR TWO?

15:13.934 --> 15:15.000
FINE, UM...

15:15.000 --> 15:16.834
I'LL GO DOWN
AND GET MY LAUNDRY,

15:16.834 --> 15:19.667
AND THEN
I'LL BE BACK.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.800
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.934
NO, CORY, YOU DON'T.

15:27.934 --> 15:29.100
YOU'RE A BIG BOY.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.867
NOTHING
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

15:30.867 --> 15:32.033
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER TO ME, COR.

15:32.033 --> 15:34.033
DID YOU KNOW TOPANGA
LIED TO ME?

15:34.033 --> 15:35.934
THEN SHE HAD THIS COMING.

15:35.934 --> 15:38.000
AND MARY BETH IS BEAUTIFUL,
AND SHE'S HERE,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.867
AND NO ONE'S EVER
GOING TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

15:39.867 --> 15:42.934
EXCEPT FOR
MARY BETH AND YOU.

15:42.934 --> 15:46.233
YOU KNOW, ERIC, WE HAD
THIS WHOLE WEEKEND
PLANNED OUT, OK?

15:46.233 --> 15:47.967
WHY DIDN'T TOPANGA
WANT TO COME WITH ME?

15:47.967 --> 15:50.000
AND, TOMORROW,
MARY BETH WILL BE GONE,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.100
AND SO WILL 16 YEARS
OF A GREAT RELATIONSHIP

15:52.100 --> 15:54.000
WITH SOMEBODY
YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.900
SOMEBODY YOU LOVE,

15:55.900 --> 15:59.033
SOMEBODY WHO'S
WORTH WAITING FOR.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.133
LISTEN TO ME, CORY.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.300
THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE,

16:01.300 --> 16:03.100
THERE'S GOING TO BE
A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES
THAT COME UP.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.100
AND THEY'RE GOING
TO SEEM GREAT, AND THEY'RE
GOING TO SEEM WONDERFUL,

16:05.100 --> 16:08.700
AND THEY'RE GOING TO SEEM
LIKE THEY MAKE YOUR LIFE
A HECK OF A LOT EASIER,

16:08.700 --> 16:10.233
BUT YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY.

16:10.233 --> 16:14.000
AND, YOU KNOW, AT TIMES,
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY
DIFFICULT TO DO THAT,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.033
BUT YOU HAVE TO,

16:15.033 --> 16:18.033
BECAUSE
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

16:18.033 --> 16:19.233
BUT, HEY,
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

16:19.233 --> 16:21.000
IT'S YOUR LIFE, COR.
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.100
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.200
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

16:23.200 --> 16:27.233
GOT TO MEET JULIE
AND HER STUDY GROUP
FOR JET SKIING.

16:27.233 --> 16:30.100
YOU KNOW, ERIC,
YOU DESERVE BETTER, TOO.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.133
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:31.133 --> 16:32.900
LISTEN, IF YOU GO
TO THIS SCHOOL,

16:32.900 --> 16:36.000
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL GOOD
FOR, LIKE, A DAY,

16:36.000 --> 16:37.200
AND THEN YOU WON'T.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.100
OK, I MEAN, I--I KNOW
YOU HAVE WORKED SO HARD
AND SO LONG.

16:41.100 --> 16:45.734
YOU DESERVE TO GO
TO A PLACE THAT'S WORTHY
OF ALL THAT EFFORT.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.667
OK? YOU SHOULD GO
TO PENNBROOK.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.867
THE INTERVIEW.

16:50.867 --> 16:53.834
YOU BLEW
THE INTERVIEW, HUH?

16:53.834 --> 16:55.867
I NEVER WENT, COR.

16:55.867 --> 16:57.800
YOU KNOW...

16:57.800 --> 16:59.000
I GOT SCARED.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.500
IT SEEMED HARD, SO...

17:01.500 --> 17:03.233
I LEFT.

17:03.233 --> 17:05.100
BUT THIS PLACE, COR,
THIS IS A SURE THING.

17:05.100 --> 17:09.400
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO WALK AWAY
FROM A SURE THING?

17:12.734 --> 17:14.834
SO...

17:14.834 --> 17:16.734
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

17:16.734 --> 17:20.400
I NEED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

17:21.667 --> 17:24.400
I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.600
LIKE THAT.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.233
LET'S GO.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.967
HEY...

17:57.967 --> 18:00.600
LOOKIE WHAT I FOUND.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.300
AAH!

18:10.467 --> 18:14.200
I'M SORRY, ERIC.
YOUR INTERVIEW
WAS 2 DAYS AGO.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.367
YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP.

18:15.367 --> 18:17.200
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
NOTIFY US.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.000
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.967
THERE ARE OTHER APPLICANTS
WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH

18:20.967 --> 18:22.467
TO SHOW UP
AT THEIR SCHEDULED TIME.

18:22.467 --> 18:23.800
I'M SORRY.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.767
I WAS SCARED.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.233
I'M NOT HERE
TO LISTEN TO EXCUSES.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.900
IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE.
IT'S HOW I FELT.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.834
I'M STILL SCARED NOW,
BUT NOT GETTING
INTO COLLEGE

18:33.834 --> 18:35.033
HAS DETERMINED WHO I AM
FOR TOO LONG,

18:35.033 --> 18:38.200
AND I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE I GO
TO THE RIGHT SCHOOL.

18:38.200 --> 18:43.100
WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT THIS IS
THE RIGHT SCHOOL FOR YOU?

18:43.100 --> 18:44.867
LOOK, I NEED
PENNBROOK, OK?

18:44.867 --> 18:46.100
ALL MY LIFE
I'VE HEARD ABOUT

18:46.100 --> 18:48.200
HOW MUCH
POTENTIAL I HAVE AND
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.500
AND--AND I USED TO THINK
IT WASN'T MUCH,
BUT NOW I DO.

18:51.500 --> 18:55.300
AND I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE I GO
TO THE RIGHT SCHOOL.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.100
I WANT TO SEE WHAT
MY POTENTIAL IS.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.934
I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO SOME SCHOOL
THAT WON'T TEST THAT.

18:59.934 --> 19:01.000
I WANT TO GO HERE.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.967
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE, ERIC.

19:02.967 --> 19:07.200
NO. PENNBROOK
IS MY CHANCE.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.400
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO ACCEPT PEOPLE

19:08.400 --> 19:11.367
THAT WANT TO LEARN
AND STUDY AND GROW,
AND IF YOU DON'T,

19:11.367 --> 19:15.567
THEN THIS SCHOOL
ISN'T LIVING UP
TO<i>ITS </i>POTENTIAL.

19:15.567 --> 19:18.834
AND I WANT MY INTERVIEW.

19:18.834 --> 19:20.700
WELL...

19:20.700 --> 19:24.367
I THINK YOU JUST HAD IT.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.367
YOU LIED TO ME.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.667
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.300
I DID.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.000
I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT
BEING ALONE WITH YOU
OVERNIGHT.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.233
THEN YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD ME THAT, OK?

19:34.233 --> 19:38.200
IF YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME,
TOPANGA, YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD ME.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.467
AND YOU CAN ALSO
TELL ME--

19:40.467 --> 19:44.200
WHEN DID YOU EVER
SAY NO TO ME
THAT I DIDN'T LISTEN?

19:44.200 --> 19:48.000
WHEN DID YOU EVER WORRY
ABOUT BEING ALONE
WITH ME?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.200
NEVER, CORY.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.500
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT ME.

19:51.500 --> 19:55.200
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT
I MIGHT DO ALONE WITH YOU

19:55.200 --> 19:58.200
AND THE BEACH
AND THE MOON.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.700
I KNOW
I'M NOT READY YET.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.934
LISTEN, I KNOW THINGS
ARE GOING TO HAPPEN
BETWEEN US

20:02.934 --> 20:06.367
WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN...

20:06.934 --> 20:09.734
AND I KNOW I'LL WAIT
UNTIL THEY DO.

20:09.734 --> 20:11.300
YEAH?

20:11.300 --> 20:11.867
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

20:11.867 --> 20:15.967
WELL, I JUST KNOW THAT
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE

20:15.967 --> 20:19.100
ARE WORTH WAITING FOR.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.300
YEAH.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.867
I FEEL THAT SAME WAY
ABOUT YOU, CORY.

20:22.867 --> 20:24.900
YEAH?

20:24.900 --> 20:26.100
SURE.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.200
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
A VERY SEXY BOY, CORY.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.567
REALLY?

20:30.567 --> 20:32.767
