00:18.627 --> 00:21.064
I really admire
how you stood your ground

00:21.064 --> 00:24.154
- for your friend Malcolm X.
- He's my brother.

00:24.154 --> 00:27.114
Malcolm and Che are gonna be
speaking at the United Nations.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.419
That's just

00:28.419 --> 00:29.681
I don't want nothing

00:29.681 --> 00:32.162
I would never betray
your confidence.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.338
Chin Gigante put
a hit out on me--

00:34.338 --> 00:36.688
something he couldn't have done
without your fuckin' approval.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.864
I told Fineman
you tried to fuck me.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.388
- Ohh.
- I'm sorry.

00:40.388 --> 00:44.131
I got you into this mess.
I'll get you out.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.089
One of those bosses
tried to have me killed.

00:46.089 --> 00:49.397
We figure out who that was,
use it as leverage.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.789
Oh!

Who'd you get to put
the hit out on me?

00:52.530 --> 00:54.576

00:56.839 --> 00:59.755
He knows, Tommy.
He knows everything.

00:59.755 --> 01:03.367
You not only put a hit out
on a boss's daughter,

01:03.367 --> 01:05.195

<i>where Brother Clyde

01:23.518 --> 01:25.650
Why are you doing all this?
Why risk your life?

01:25.650 --> 01:30.351
I wanted to redeem myself
through deed and not word.

01:30.351 --> 01:33.397
You want me to convince Lillian
to go away with her husband,

01:33.397 --> 01:35.530
and you won't tell me why?

01:35.530 --> 01:37.227
Archie's been doing
some work for me.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.316
And there's some people
that think

01:39.316 --> 01:41.405
that he might be talking
to the Feds.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.580
They could be right.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.669
Ellsworth, what have you
gotten him into?

01:47.759 --> 01:50.153
Oh!

God! Archie! Archie!

01:52.590 --> 01:54.244

the classified informant!

01:54.244 --> 01:56.420
You left him wide-ass open!

01:56.420 --> 01:59.423
I have no idea
who Archie Gaines is.

01:59.423 --> 02:02.513
And there's a much bigger game
being played here.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.863
It's about the fate
of this country.

02:04.863 --> 02:07.257
<i>I should've smelled

02:07.257 --> 02:08.693
What?

02:08.693 --> 02:10.173
You were the only one
I told about Malcolm

02:10.173 --> 02:12.610

at the United Nations.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.744
Do you understand
what your friend is doing?

02:15.744 --> 02:17.702
Partnering with Che Guevara,
a man who wants to have

02:17.702 --> 02:20.183
communist revolutions
all over the world.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.619
The buddy-buddy shit

02:21.619 --> 02:23.969

if not your life.

02:23.969 --> 02:28.191

Operation Mongoose goes public.

02:28.191 --> 02:31.760

I don't trust you anymore.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.154

12:15.865 --> 12:17.388
And what can I do?

12:17.388 --> 12:20.043
Do I have to
spell it out for you?

12:20.043 --> 12:21.871
Joe Colombo is using the lies

12:21.871 --> 12:24.439
to align the families
against us.

12:24.439 --> 12:27.268
He wants to start a war.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.052
You're gonna have to talk
to the other bosses.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.880
You're gonna have to
tell them that your brother

12:30.880 --> 12:33.404
will not tolerate
these lies!

12:35.972 --> 12:39.584
I don't think it's a good idea
for me to get involved.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.412
There are lives
at stake here, Lou.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.327
You have to look
deep in your heart

12:43.327 --> 12:45.808
and you have to
ask yourself...

12:45.808 --> 12:48.463
"What would Jesus do?"

12:48.463 --> 12:50.900
What would Jesus do?

12:54.034 --> 12:55.992
Mr. Guevara, Mr. Johnson,

12:55.992 --> 12:57.864
thank you for coming
to meet with us.

12:57.864 --> 13:01.345
Mr. Guevara, any friend of
Malcolm's is a friend of mine.

13:01.345 --> 13:02.607
Mm.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.958
As for me.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.438
As I no longer have my men
protecting Malcolm,

13:07.438 --> 13:09.223
I come with a warning.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.965
I have credible information
that CIA proxies are planning

13:11.965 --> 13:17.622
to assassinate you both--
this week at the UN.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.843
The CIA has been throwing
poisonous darts at Fidel

13:20.843 --> 13:22.453
since '59.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.891
Why would they hit
the bull's-eye now?

13:24.891 --> 13:28.198
Because you're here.
On our shores.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.547
And later this week,
they have you both

13:29.547 --> 13:31.854
in the same place
at the same time.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.856
With the world watching.

13:33.856 --> 13:37.555
They'll stop at nothing.
I-I know these men.

13:37.555 --> 13:40.341
Che's cause is our cause.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.951
His words are for the good

13:41.951 --> 13:44.432
of brown and black people
the world over.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.391
What good can a man do for
blacks and browns if he's dead?

13:47.391 --> 13:50.133
What do you do when faced
with an enemy?

13:51.961 --> 13:54.877
Do you run? Do you hide?

13:54.877 --> 13:56.879
I fight. I fight smart.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.881
You and Malcolm should not be
in the same place

13:58.881 --> 14:00.535
at the same time!

14:12.982 --> 14:16.116
I should be serving <i>you.</i>

14:16.116 --> 14:19.032
It helps for me to keep busy.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.903
Keeps my mind occupied.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.471
Really, Lillian, my problems
are nothing compared to yours.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.560
Eat. You look like
you're wasting away.

14:28.302 --> 14:32.045
Both of our husbands
involved in criminal activity.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.699
Still can't believe it.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.179
I will never forgive Bumpy

14:36.179 --> 14:38.225
for involving Archie
in his affairs.

14:38.225 --> 14:42.011
I thought
he knew better...

14:42.011 --> 14:44.144
my Archie.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.449
Now he's dead.

14:45.449 --> 14:48.365
Oh, Lillian, my heart
breaks for you.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.411
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mayme,

14:50.411 --> 14:51.673
I never understood
how you could be

14:51.673 --> 14:54.545
with a criminal
in the first place.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.373
A good Christian woman
like you.

14:56.373 --> 14:59.594
Bumpy has many sides.

14:59.594 --> 15:02.989
You need to find yourself
a good man, a decent man.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.341
A man like Archie.

15:07.341 --> 15:11.214
And when you find him,
hold on tight.

15:11.214 --> 15:14.043
Never let him
out of your sight.

15:14.043 --> 15:17.264
Because maybe one day
he'll be gone...

15:17.264 --> 15:19.440
- Oh, Lillian.
- Mnh.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.051
Take my advice.

15:22.051 --> 15:26.360
Stay away
from Bumpy Johnson.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.275
And never look back.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.977
Everything
in your autobiography

15:34.977 --> 15:36.631
is in your own words.

15:36.631 --> 15:39.373
I don't know
how you did it.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.984
You got me to open up
about my past.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.159
Hmm.

15:43.159 --> 15:46.075
My mother,
my days as a hustler.

15:46.075 --> 15:49.600
Well, I have to admit, it wasn't
easy gaining your trust.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.080
You've only gained
75% of my trust.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.516
That's better
than where I started.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.084
What was it-- 20%?

15:55.084 --> 15:56.390
Was it that high?

16:00.742 --> 16:02.178
There is something, Alex,

16:02.178 --> 16:03.788
that I've left out
of my autobiography.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.486
Oh, yeah?

16:05.486 --> 16:08.445
I've been writing
about it in my diary.

16:08.445 --> 16:12.580
I'm thinking about turning it
into another book.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.975
But I'm afraid my time
may be running out.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.804
I may not write that book.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.284
I may not live to see
this one published.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.025
I don't like
hearing you say that.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.548
You know I've always been keen
on not wasting time,

16:24.548 --> 16:26.681
and I don't want
to waste yours.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.205
There's another chapter
we must write.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.468
- About what?
- Bumpy Johnson.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.297
The gangster.
What about him?

16:34.297 --> 16:37.039
I want to explain
our friendship

16:37.039 --> 16:39.259
and why white society

16:39.259 --> 16:43.480
should fear him
even more than they fear me.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.669
Thanks for agreeing
to meet me.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.585
I agreed to talk.
This isn't a date.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.415
I know.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.374
It's for Lillian.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.293
I'll be sure she gets them.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.427
I wish this could've
all been avoided.

17:17.427 --> 17:20.300
Yes.
If he'd never met you.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.781
I tried to help Archie.
This is not my fault.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.523
It's the same old story.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.395
I've heard it before.

17:28.395 --> 17:31.093
Anyway, I didn't come here
to talk about that or us, so...

17:31.093 --> 17:33.182
No?

17:33.182 --> 17:36.098
I want to ask you
for a favor.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.318
A favor?

17:38.318 --> 17:40.711
- You have your nerve.
- For Malcolm.

17:40.711 --> 17:43.801
- What about Malcolm?
- He's in serious danger.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.194
I want you
to talk to Powell,

17:45.194 --> 17:46.587
see if he can put
Federal agents on him.

17:46.587 --> 17:49.111
Trustworthy ones.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.244
Is this really
about Malcolm?

17:51.244 --> 17:53.159
That why you're here?

17:53.159 --> 17:54.464
Well, I'd plead to
have you come back home,

17:54.464 --> 17:57.728
but I know
that's not gonna work.

17:57.728 --> 18:02.385
So... yeah,
I'm here for Malcolm.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.344
Adam's in Washington.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.085
I'll have to talk
to Roy Wingate.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.437
- Thanks.
- Is there anything else?

18:13.657 --> 18:15.442
Yeah.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.098
I love you.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.536
Come home.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.435
Gentlemen, I want
to thank you all again

18:52.435 --> 18:54.785
for agreeing
to meet with me.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.874
I'm very honored
to be here.

18:56.874 --> 19:00.922
Well, the honor is really ours
there, Father Louis.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.491
I haven't been to church
for a long time.

19:04.491 --> 19:07.494
Your being here
makes me feel good.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.626
How can we help you,
Father?

19:09.626 --> 19:11.846
As God is my witness,

19:11.846 --> 19:13.978
the concerns I'm about to convey
are not my own.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.937
They come from
my brother Vincent,

19:15.937 --> 19:18.853
who, you know,
remains in prison.

19:18.853 --> 19:22.596
If Chin has a beef,
let us hear it.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.294
My brother seems to think
that there are rumors

19:25.294 --> 19:27.253
about his wife
and-- and daughter

19:27.253 --> 19:29.733
that are being spread for the
purpose of creating division.

19:29.733 --> 19:33.302
And he's concerned that
this could lead to violence.

19:33.302 --> 19:36.958
Naturally, he wishes
to prevent this.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.656
Naturally, Father.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.398
My brother is...

19:42.398 --> 19:44.748
of the belief
that you, Joe Colombo,

19:44.748 --> 19:47.490
have falsely accused
his wife, Olympia,

19:47.490 --> 19:48.883
of trying to kill
his daughter, Stella.

19:51.538 --> 19:54.280
Father, I was entrusted
with protecting Chin's daughter

19:54.280 --> 19:56.020
from men who tried to kill her.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.588
Unfortunately,
to this day,

19:58.588 --> 20:02.636
we still don't know
who that was.

20:02.636 --> 20:05.029
I've never said a word
about Chin's wife or daughter

20:05.029 --> 20:07.293
to anyone.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.427
Gentlemen, I--

20:11.427 --> 20:13.951
I don't mean
to cause problems.

20:13.951 --> 20:16.867
My message is simple.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.739
Stop these rumors.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.439
And keep my brother
in-- in your prayers

20:23.439 --> 20:24.875
that he may be
released soon.

20:24.875 --> 20:28.879
I'm sure he will.
Is there anything else, Father?

20:29.706 --> 20:31.578
There is one more piece
of information

20:31.578 --> 20:33.754
that I've been asked
to convey.

20:35.712 --> 20:38.062
My brother has lost all faith
in Joe Colombo

20:38.062 --> 20:39.890
to look after
his affairs in Harlem.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.284
He wishes it to be known
to all of you

20:42.284 --> 20:45.418
that he and Joe Colombo
no longer have any agreement.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.943
What?

20:48.943 --> 20:51.075
I hope my words have helped

20:51.075 --> 20:53.513
to lower the temperature
between you all

20:53.513 --> 20:56.777
and that we will avoid
any unnecessary violence.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.474
Good day.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.700
That motherfucker!

21:06.700 --> 21:09.355
What kind of fucking priest
is this?!

21:09.355 --> 21:11.618
He just threw a hand grenade
into the commission!

21:11.618 --> 21:12.923
It can't have been his idea.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.578
My guess is that Olympia
put him up to it.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.014
She's probably terrified

21:17.014 --> 21:19.321
my father's gonna find out
and kill her.

21:19.321 --> 21:23.020
It's safer for her if he's
at war with you and the others.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.719
So what do you recommend we do?
Kill Olympia?

21:25.719 --> 21:27.590
No.

21:27.590 --> 21:31.899
The man my father trusts most
in this world is Uncle Louis.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.380
The trick's to convince him
that Olympia's lying.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.600
Oh! How do I do that?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.472
I'm not sure.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.345
I gotta nip this in the bud.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.915
The other families may side
with Chin in a war,

21:47.915 --> 21:51.005
even though they know
I'm telling the truth!

21:51.005 --> 21:53.094
What are you gonna do?

21:53.094 --> 21:54.965
I've never killed
a priest before.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.620
First time
for everything.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.448
Joe, please don't do that.

21:59.448 --> 22:00.754
What if I don't
have a choice?

22:00.754 --> 22:02.625
Uncle Louis is
the one member of my family

22:02.625 --> 22:05.367
who's always been good to me.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.717
Just let me speak with him.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.110
Please?

22:17.858 --> 22:20.774
Y-Yes. Yes, sir.
I understand. But--

22:22.732 --> 22:24.778
Okay.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.649
Thank you
for your time.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.958
Police commissioner refuses
to put any men on Malcolm.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.829
Adam called him personally
from Washington.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.178
He also called the mayor

22:34.178 --> 22:36.006
and Assistant
District Attorney Pike.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.878
He's very concerned,
as you are,

22:37.878 --> 22:39.009
but there's pushback
from law enforcement.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.533
- Of course.
- The usual excuses.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.404
Not enough manpower.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.667
And with Che being in town,
they're using extra men to guard

22:44.667 --> 22:46.800
against Cuban agitators
and communist spies.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.758
Malcolm's the one
they should be protecting.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.194
After his trip
from Africa,

22:50.194 --> 22:53.067
he's more influential than ever
and more feared.

22:53.067 --> 22:56.113
Because he's helping to fight
for a more just world.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.898
Why is that so scary?

22:57.898 --> 22:59.856
Maybe people are afraid
of what they don't know.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.858
I mean, we don't know
what a world with equality

23:01.858 --> 23:03.730
would look like, do we?

23:05.079 --> 23:06.689
No.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.694
You have to convince Malcolm
to stay away from the UN.

23:11.694 --> 23:13.522
He's been breaking his back,

23:13.522 --> 23:16.003
struggling to put a coalition
together for months.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.179
He won't get another
opportunity like this.

23:18.179 --> 23:21.443
Talking about the NYPD,

23:21.443 --> 23:23.880
the FBI, the CIA.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.534
All puppet-masters.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.449
How many chances will he get
to take the world stage

23:27.449 --> 23:29.538
with someone like Che?

23:29.538 --> 23:31.235
Tell me about the guards.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.890
He peeled me off.
Who's on him now?

23:33.890 --> 23:36.066
He's got about 30 followers
who were Fruit of Islam,

23:36.066 --> 23:37.590
so they have
some background.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.113
And the United Nations
is providing security

23:39.113 --> 23:40.723
for the event.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.551
You gotta talk him
outta this.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.814
He's a--
He's a sittin' duck.

23:44.814 --> 23:47.600
It's almost like he knows
he's gonna die.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.210
He's accepted it.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.258
He's tired of running.

23:54.258 --> 23:55.999
There's no way anybody's
gonna talk him out of it.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.480
Not you. Not me. Not Betty.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.091
Not anybody.

24:01.091 --> 24:04.486
Then for your safety I can't
condone you sitting by his side.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.748
What you do or don't condone

24:05.748 --> 24:07.794
stopped mattering to me
a long time ago.

24:07.794 --> 24:11.101
But I'll keep my eyes open
and my eyes to the ground,

24:11.101 --> 24:13.147
like you taught me.

24:14.278 --> 24:17.760
Twenty blocks around the UN
will be completely shut down.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.240
Pedestrian checkpoints
at every crossing.

24:19.240 --> 24:23.897
NYPD in full engagement,
coordinating 150 motorcades.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.289
What about the Feds?

24:25.289 --> 24:27.640
The Feds'll have
40 first-rank USMC snipers

24:27.640 --> 24:29.511
on every building top.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.773
What's this?

24:30.773 --> 24:33.515
Staging a protest
as a distraction.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.560
That's where they'll
be expecting trouble--

24:34.560 --> 24:35.952
the protesters.

24:35.952 --> 24:37.911
Got mostly, uh, señoritas

24:37.911 --> 24:41.784
from whatever's left of
Operation 40 in Union City.

24:41.784 --> 24:42.959
Fantastic.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.657
Yeah. Yeah.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.967
East River-- Zones 1 and 2--
completely shut down.

24:50.967 --> 24:54.754
No commercial vessels
from 35th to 59th.

24:54.754 --> 24:58.018
So how the fuck are we gonna
kill these two commie bastards?

25:01.151 --> 25:03.850
Queens? Long Island City?

25:06.853 --> 25:08.768
So we got to figure out
how these motherfuckers

25:08.768 --> 25:10.334
are gonna hit
Malcolm and Che

25:10.334 --> 25:13.033
with all the security
at the United Nations.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.339
Rifle hits,
if they're professional,

25:15.339 --> 25:17.646
work off triangulation
of crossfire.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.735
You can't do that
with two targets.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.651
First one's down,
all hell breaks loose.

25:22.651 --> 25:25.698
The odds of hitting the second
go down to zero.

25:25.698 --> 25:28.788
Pettigrew, go now--
stake out Battle's.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.267
I want to know who's coming
and who's going, alright?

25:30.267 --> 25:33.096
You got it, Bump.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.664
NYPD and the Feds are
pullin' out all the stops.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.013
Shit's sealed tight.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.580
They gonna have to
get real creative.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.191
And they will.
Don't doubt that.

25:41.191 --> 25:44.151
Want I should call my boy
Crawford in the 13th Precinct?

25:44.151 --> 25:46.153
See if he's heard anything
around the campfire?

25:46.153 --> 25:49.722
Later. First, I want you to send
a message to Wild Bill Harvey

25:49.722 --> 25:51.550
and do a little recon.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.118
You alright?

25:55.118 --> 25:56.946
Yeah.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.688
Anything you wanna
jaw about?

26:03.257 --> 26:08.001
You're not a praying man.
I'm not a praying man.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.917
But before you go
to bed tonight,

26:10.917 --> 26:13.572
let's hit our knees
for Malcolm.

26:16.705 --> 26:20.100
A man like Bumpy Johnson
is more than just a criminal.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.885
He's a-- a hyper-intelligent,
fearless,

26:22.885 --> 26:25.714
self-made man
who knows who and what he is

26:25.714 --> 26:29.979
and takes pride in being
an unstoppable force.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.981
He's forged
in the fires of adversity

26:31.981 --> 26:36.725
and willed himself to be a king
in the white man's jungle.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.901
A man like that
can change the world.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.642
And has Bumpy done so?

26:42.122 --> 26:43.819
Not yet.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.908
It's a project
I'm still working on.

26:48.302 --> 26:51.740
Look, Malcolm...

26:51.740 --> 26:54.308
maybe writing this chapter
isn't such a good idea.

26:56.136 --> 26:58.225
I need future generations
to understand

26:58.225 --> 27:00.662
why I'm friends with a man
who, on the surface,

27:00.662 --> 27:04.884
is morally against
everything I believe in.

27:04.884 --> 27:09.018
Society judges men like Bumpy
because they're scared of him,

27:09.018 --> 27:11.064
just like
they're scared of me.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.456
You have your faith.

27:12.456 --> 27:16.460
How does a man like Bumpy
transform like you?

27:16.460 --> 27:18.201
By believing in something
bigger than himself.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.073
And what is that?

27:20.073 --> 27:23.076
A vision...

27:23.076 --> 27:27.341
of a future that's so real
you can taste it.

27:27.341 --> 27:30.997
A world where we are
honored and equal,

27:30.997 --> 27:35.697
where past hurts
no longer haunt us.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.787
Where a man
like Bumpy Johnson

27:38.787 --> 27:43.096
can apply his
considerable intelligence

27:43.096 --> 27:47.013
to pursuits that have
nothing to do with narcotics.

27:47.013 --> 27:51.974
When the black gangster gains
political and social conscience

27:51.974 --> 27:55.456
and makes the so-called "ghetto"
his homeland

27:55.456 --> 27:57.980
and treats her with the--

27:57.980 --> 28:00.113
the respect a true
homeland deserves,

28:00.113 --> 28:02.942
white America will tremble.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.421
Mm.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.170
May God be with you.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.963
Father Louis,
why would you try

28:23.963 --> 28:26.008
to start a war
against Joe Colombo?

28:26.008 --> 28:29.055
Stella?
W-What are you doing here?

28:29.055 --> 28:32.014
I'm here to tell you
that Olympia's full of shit.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.407
She's lying to you.

28:33.407 --> 28:36.192
She got Tommy Lucchese
to send one of his men

28:36.192 --> 28:39.848
to kill me,
but I managed to kill him first.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.198
Have you been taking
your medication?

28:42.198 --> 28:43.852
I'm not crazy,
Uncle Louis.

28:43.852 --> 28:46.028
You know how vengeful
Olympia can be.

28:48.465 --> 28:50.903
No. I don't believe that.

28:50.903 --> 28:54.080
And-- And why in God's name
are you siding

28:54.080 --> 28:56.822
with Joe Colombo
over your own family?

28:56.822 --> 28:58.780
I'm siding with truth.

28:58.780 --> 29:02.305
I thought as a man of God
you would, too.

29:02.305 --> 29:05.047
Olympia is a good
and kind woman.

29:05.047 --> 29:08.050
She would never be
a part of a murder.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.486
Why are you doing this?

29:09.486 --> 29:12.141
Even after you had Vincent
arrested he forgave you.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.883
He's your family.
He stuck by you.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.885
Why can't you do the same?

29:16.885 --> 29:18.974
It's a dangerous game
you're playing with Olympia.

29:18.974 --> 29:22.325
I'm actually trying
to help you.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.545
Joe Colombo would
just as soon whack you.

29:27.156 --> 29:30.377
Devil spawn! These are the words
of Beelzebub himself.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.858
He's clearly taken possession
of your soul.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.816
You get out
of my confessional!

29:34.816 --> 29:38.472
And don't come back until
you're ready to repent!

29:38.472 --> 29:42.563
I'll say ten "Hail Marys"
for you, Uncle.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.217
You're gonna need them.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.594
- Good evening.
- Go on ahead.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.958
Thanks for seeing me.

30:29.958 --> 30:32.961
Well, I hear you got
something good. Lay it on me.

30:32.961 --> 30:37.052
Well, as you know, my boss has
been protecting Malcolm X.

30:37.052 --> 30:39.489
Yeah.
That's, uh, old news.

30:39.489 --> 30:42.318
Well, I'm here to tell you
that you have an ally.

30:42.318 --> 30:45.408
- An ally? Is that so?
- Yeah.

30:45.408 --> 30:48.411
'Cause I hate that big-mouth
motherfucker more than you do.

30:48.411 --> 30:49.978
Why is that?

30:49.978 --> 30:52.589
What some of my people
fail to understand is--

30:52.589 --> 30:56.202
America-haters
like Malcolm X,

30:56.202 --> 30:58.639
they don't help the cause.
They fuck it up.

30:58.639 --> 31:02.904
So I'd love to see
that motherfucker smoked.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.340
Yeah, you know,
people tend to forget

31:04.340 --> 31:05.907
that this is
a great fucking country.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.562
You're damn right.
I fought for this country.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.172
Yeah, I know.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.261
Delbert C. Chance. 503rd.

31:12.261 --> 31:14.176
All-black field
artillery battalion.

31:14.176 --> 31:17.440
2nd Infantry.
Silver star.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.181
That's me.

31:22.315 --> 31:26.275
Do you know why
the Civil Rights Act passed?

31:26.275 --> 31:29.191
Why Negroes are now
getting elected to office?

31:29.191 --> 31:34.022
Because guys like me
eliminate impediments.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.937
- Impediments?
- Well, to democracy.

31:35.937 --> 31:39.201
I keep the train tracks
clear of impediments

31:39.201 --> 31:42.596
like Malcolm X
who just want to blow shit up

31:42.596 --> 31:46.208
instead of working to improve
the Negro situation over time.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.210
I keep the train
moving forward.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.560
So how can I help you
clear the tracks?

31:50.560 --> 31:52.954
Well, mostly by
cutting the shit.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.217
Whether you actually hate
Malcolm X or not,

31:55.217 --> 31:57.393
we both know you are
more loyal to Bumpy Johnson

31:57.393 --> 32:00.701
than anyone or anything.

32:00.701 --> 32:03.269
So as I respect your service
to this country,

32:03.269 --> 32:06.141
I will afford you 30 seconds
to say what you came here to say

32:06.141 --> 32:08.361
and then get the fuck out.

32:19.720 --> 32:23.593
Bumpy wanted me to remind you--
in case you forgot--

32:23.593 --> 32:26.074
that he's still got
this little bedtime story

32:26.074 --> 32:28.294
called
Operation Mongoose.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.298
You tell Bumpy Johnson

32:32.298 --> 32:36.084
that Malcolm X's UN speech
is a greater threat to America

32:36.084 --> 32:40.001
than any fringe article
he might...

32:40.001 --> 32:43.091
cook up
about Fidel Castro.

32:43.091 --> 32:45.354
Bumpy should tell his friend
to keep his fat mouth shut

32:45.354 --> 32:48.096
about revolution
in the streets of America

32:48.096 --> 32:51.056
if he wants to keep Betty
from becoming a widow.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.060
Thank you for your time.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.035
Bumpy.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.689
Hey. How'd it go?

33:15.689 --> 33:18.822
That Wild Bill
is one fat, crazy fucker.

33:18.822 --> 33:20.607
He don't fuck around at all.

33:20.607 --> 33:24.306
But I got a good look at things,
just like you wanted.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.047
I saw an artillery box
in his office

33:26.047 --> 33:28.702
with the word "Stovepipe"
printed on it.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.617
- Stovepipe?
- Yeah.

33:30.617 --> 33:34.316
In the war, that's what we used
to call M-20 rocket launchers.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.753
Bunker-busters--
used for blastin' tanks

33:36.753 --> 33:38.320
from up to 1,100 feet.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.322
Long-range weaponry.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.629
East River's only about
900 feet from the UN.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.413
They could
launch that thing

33:44.413 --> 33:46.328
anywhere from up and down
the shoreline

33:46.328 --> 33:48.765
off 50th Avenue
at Hunter's Point

33:48.765 --> 33:51.159
all the way up
to the Pepsi-Cola sign.

33:51.159 --> 33:54.119
Crazy. But smart.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.556
They could avoid all of the cops
on the UN perimeter.

33:56.556 --> 33:59.341
On my way in,
I saw a fruit truck.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.256
Now, that
"fruit cart" tactic--

34:01.256 --> 34:04.259
that shit goes way back
to the Civil War.

34:04.259 --> 34:06.566
They had weapons
in those things.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.698
Alright.
What you wanna do?

34:08.698 --> 34:10.526
Tomorrow,
before the speech,

34:10.526 --> 34:12.311
you and Pettigrew are gonna
cover from Hunter's Point

34:12.311 --> 34:14.269
all the way
to the Pepsi sign,

34:14.269 --> 34:15.705
see if you can find
that fruit truck.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.273
Alright.
What about you?

34:21.755 --> 34:24.714
I'm gonna have to cancel
Malcolm's schedule for the day.

34:47.259 --> 34:50.131
I'm sorry, Lillian.
Am I interrupting?

34:50.131 --> 34:54.744
It's okay, Mayme.
Mr. Gilford was just leaving.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.659
You must be
Mrs. Johnson.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.531
I've heard so much
about you.

34:58.531 --> 35:01.621
You have my agency's card.
We'll be in touch.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.585
Who is that man?

35:09.585 --> 35:12.719
He's one of the best private
detectives in the country.

35:12.719 --> 35:15.635
I've just hired him
to find Archie's murderer.

35:15.635 --> 35:17.593
What are you
talking about?

35:17.593 --> 35:20.770
I can't trust the police.
They're doing nothing.

35:20.770 --> 35:24.600
Between you and me, we can
bring whoever's guilty to jail.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.603
But Archie was involved
in my husband's businesses.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.257
That's our first clue.

35:29.257 --> 35:30.954
But a private detective
could put Bumpy in jeopardy.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.652
So what?!

35:32.652 --> 35:35.568
You fight for social justice,
don't you?

35:35.568 --> 35:37.265
How about
regular justice?

35:37.265 --> 35:40.529
Lillian, you're going to
put my husband in danger.

35:40.529 --> 35:43.358
Your husband can burn in hell,
for all I care.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.881
And you should feel
the same way.

35:44.881 --> 35:47.754
Now, Archie was up to his neck
in criminal activities,

35:47.754 --> 35:49.190
just like Ellsworth.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.192
He didn't deserve
to die for it!

35:51.192 --> 35:52.715
Bumpy tried to save him.

35:52.715 --> 35:56.284
- You're on his side?!
- You bet your ass I am.

35:56.284 --> 35:59.157
- Call that man off.
- I will not!

36:00.636 --> 36:04.858
- Call that man off.
- I will not!

36:05.554 --> 36:08.514
Now, I know you don't want me
to rip that wig off your head

36:08.514 --> 36:10.516
and parade you
down St. Nick.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.650
Dial.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.458
You know me?

37:11.316 --> 37:13.666
I told him he shouldn't have
talked to you that way.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.885
If it wasn't for you,
he'd be dead.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.758
If he knows what's good for him,
he'll mind his business.

37:18.758 --> 37:20.890
Let's go.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.545
Well, the parts are heavy.
Needs to be assembled on site.

37:23.545 --> 37:26.983
Axis, shield plate,
base-skis, launch tube.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.638
We'll load it in the back
of a fruit truck for cover.

37:29.638 --> 37:32.946
I have a bunch of crates of
apples and bananas in the back.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.991
After the hit,
going over the bridge.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.474
You'll position on the crest
right here--

37:39.474 --> 37:43.391
the bank of the Adam Metal
Supply Plant on 50th Avenue.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.306
Now, we've arranged for you
to use their garage

37:45.306 --> 37:46.612
as cover if need be.

37:46.612 --> 37:48.396
The truck will leave
from here?

37:48.396 --> 37:51.094
Yeah. But you're gonna be
in place and ready to go

37:51.094 --> 37:53.967
by the time Che arrives
at the United Nations.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.577
And the coordinates?

37:55.577 --> 37:59.668
40.748 and 73.968.

37:59.668 --> 38:01.453
Very good.

38:01.453 --> 38:02.845
Your target is the third floor
of the General Assembly

38:02.845 --> 38:04.499
where Che and Malcolm
will speak.

38:04.499 --> 38:05.935
Make your shot.
You hop in the truck,

38:05.935 --> 38:08.721
and you deliver whatever
bullshit fruit we left you.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.028
Alright.

38:12.028 --> 38:14.857
Go take a peek and make sure
the launcher's properly hidden.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.032
Then go kill
these bastards.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.382
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.949
Give them hell.

38:19.949 --> 38:21.908
Those are great guys
you have.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.432
It's a shame.

38:24.432 --> 38:25.607
Easy to clean?

38:26.869 --> 38:28.567
Clean?

38:28.567 --> 38:31.961
No family, records,
permanent address, right?

38:31.961 --> 38:34.747
My understanding was
they would only be eliminated

38:34.747 --> 38:36.618
in case of an arrest.

38:36.618 --> 38:39.404
Succeed or fail, we were never
gonna leave them alive, Jose.

38:39.404 --> 38:40.970
I thought
you understood that.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.798
We're not playing
Monopoly here.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.821
What is this?
What is this, Bumpy?

39:05.821 --> 39:08.563
I'm sorry, Malcolm.
You're not going to the UN.

39:08.563 --> 39:10.957
- I'm afraid I am.
- I can't allow it.

39:10.957 --> 39:13.046
This is the single most
important opportunity

39:13.046 --> 39:15.440
I've ever had to build
a coalition for our people.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.919
Or it's a deathtrap.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.139
Have you lost your mind?

39:19.139 --> 39:21.010
Brother Malcolm,
if Brother Johnson

39:21.010 --> 39:23.404
has what he deems
as credible information...

39:23.404 --> 39:24.623
I'm tired of
running scared.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.625
I made a vow
to protect you.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.453
And that's what I'm doing.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.503
Man, I wish this car
could go faster.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.200
Yeah. We just need to
get by the water.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.507
- Stay by the water.
- Okay.

39:39.507 --> 39:41.030
<i>As the world watches,</i>

39:41.030 --> 39:43.555
<i>Che Guevara is minutes away
from taking the stage</i>

39:43.555 --> 39:45.470
<i>at the United Nations
in New York City,</i>

39:45.470 --> 39:48.690
<i>while thousands of concerned
citizens take to the streets</i>

39:48.690 --> 39:51.737
<i>to protest his message
of revolutionary communism</i>

39:51.737 --> 39:53.695
<i>as a threat to our democracy.</i>

39:53.695 --> 39:56.045
<i>Also slated to speak
is Malcolm X,</i>

39:56.045 --> 39:58.091
<i>who has joined forces with Che</i>

39:58.091 --> 40:00.833
<i>in what promises to be
another incitement of violence</i>

40:00.833 --> 40:04.532
<i>on the streets of urban centers
throughout our nation.</i>

40:04.532 --> 40:07.883
I want your protection dismissed.

40:07.883 --> 40:11.800
Now, please move out
of the way so we can go.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.677
You gonna shoot me, brother?

40:18.677 --> 40:20.940
I'll shoot you in the
goddamn foot if I have to.

40:20.940 --> 40:25.161
You're not going anywhere.
Don't make me do it.

40:27.773 --> 40:30.036
<i>Security is tight
as Che Guevara</i>

40:30.036 --> 40:31.733
<i>makes his way through a hall</i>

40:31.733 --> 40:33.953
<i>packed with diplomats
and reporters.</i>

40:33.953 --> 40:36.042
<i>He and the rest of
the Cuban delegation</i>

40:36.042 --> 40:38.610
<i>take their place
in the General Assembly.</i>

40:38.610 --> 40:42.178
<i>However, still no sign
of Malcolm X.</i>

40:44.790 --> 40:46.966
I won't forgive you
for this.

40:49.142 --> 40:50.883
<i>Mr. Guevara takes his place</i>

40:50.883 --> 40:52.667
<i>at the podium
of the General Assembly.</i>

40:52.667 --> 40:54.103
<i>Let's listen in.</i>

40:54.103 --> 40:55.844
<i>I welcome
this opportunity</i>

40:55.844 --> 40:57.672
<i>to speak to the Nations
of the World.</i>

40:57.672 --> 40:59.500
<i>Many of whom fear me...</i>

40:59.500 --> 41:02.590
<i>and my people,
the Cuban people.</i>

41:02.590 --> 41:05.593
But why do they fear us?

41:05.593 --> 41:07.639
<i>Because we are willing to die
for what we believe in.</i>

41:07.639 --> 41:08.944
That's it.

41:08.944 --> 41:11.904
<i>Homeland or death.</i>

41:11.904 --> 41:14.036
<i>That is the question
all Cuban people</i>

41:14.036 --> 41:17.083
<i>should ask in the face
of the aggressor</i>

41:17.083 --> 41:21.696
<i>who see our freedom
as a danger to theirs.</i>

41:21.696 --> 41:25.134
<i>Why would any revolutionary
die for their cause?</i>

41:25.134 --> 41:27.963
<i>Because their cause is just.</i>

41:27.963 --> 41:31.097
<i>And although we don't have
the power of a United States,</i>

41:31.097 --> 41:35.971
<i>the fact that we are willing
to die makes us more powerful.</i>

41:35.971 --> 41:38.278
<i>I will never quit.</i>

41:38.278 --> 41:40.672
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Okay. We got it. We got it.

41:40.672 --> 41:44.545
<i>If you tremble with indignation
at every injustice,</i>

41:44.545 --> 41:46.286
<i>then you are a comrade of mine.</i>

41:46.286 --> 41:49.637
<i>To all revolutionaries
around the world,</i>

41:49.637 --> 41:52.814
<i>if you want justice
and equality,</i>

41:52.814 --> 41:54.642
<i>ask yourselves,</i>

41:54.642 --> 41:57.645
<i>are you willing to die?</i>

41:57.645 --> 42:01.257
Homeland or death.
That is the choice.

42:01.257 --> 42:03.564
<i>And whatever your cause is--</i>

42:03.564 --> 42:07.960
<i>civil rights, economic freedom,
or racial equality--</i>

42:07.960 --> 42:10.005
<i>never surrender.</i>

42:10.005 --> 42:11.180
<i>I have a wish.</i>

42:11.180 --> 42:12.878
<i>It is a fear, as well...</i>

42:12.878 --> 42:14.575
- I think it's over there.
<i>- ...that my end will be by...</i>

42:14.575 --> 42:16.577
Okay.
We're almost at it.

42:16.577 --> 42:18.579
Where's my rifle?

42:18.579 --> 42:21.103
<i>And each one of us alone
is worth nothing,</i>

42:21.103 --> 42:23.018
<i>and so we fight.</i>

42:23.018 --> 42:25.804
<i>We fight for
our independence...</i>

42:27.196 --> 42:29.982
<i>...and hear well
our cry of battle.</i>

42:33.420 --> 42:35.640
<i>Patria o muerte.</i>

42:35.640 --> 42:36.858
<i>iVenceremos!</i>

42:39.687 --> 42:43.343
It seems your precautions
were unnecessary after all.

42:47.042 --> 42:50.829
I suggest you take your men
and leave.

42:50.829 --> 42:51.830
For good.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.183
Have it your way, Malcolm.

42:59.011 --> 43:00.882
Let's go, fellas.

43:20.075 --> 43:21.163
Baby.

43:35.177 --> 43:36.918
Oh.

43:42.271 --> 43:44.230
I can't live without you.

43:46.145 --> 43:49.757
It is as simple as that.

43:49.757 --> 43:51.454
I've been so lost.

43:56.764 --> 43:58.766
So lost.

44:04.903 --> 44:07.296
I am glad you got me
to write this chapter

44:07.296 --> 44:08.994
on Bumpy Johnson.

44:13.259 --> 44:15.391
I understand your thesis--

44:15.391 --> 44:19.439
that a society that denies
the opportunity to the black man

44:19.439 --> 44:22.311
can only expect him
to become an outlaw.

44:22.311 --> 44:25.880
And as legitimate
opportunities grow

44:25.880 --> 44:27.099
with our
civil rights movement,

44:27.099 --> 44:29.144
the black gangster
will have to shift

44:29.144 --> 44:32.800
his unique skills
to larger social purposes

44:32.800 --> 44:34.802
than simply
his own enrichment.

44:34.802 --> 44:36.325
No, Alex.

44:39.851 --> 44:41.853
I was wrong.

44:43.028 --> 44:44.943
What are you doing?

44:44.943 --> 44:48.773
Maybe a man like Bumpy Johnson
can't change.

44:48.773 --> 44:50.731
Maybe he's stuck
in that hidebound

44:50.731 --> 44:52.733
"Negro ain't nothing
but a criminal" mode.

44:55.170 --> 44:57.259
I want nothing more
to do with him.
