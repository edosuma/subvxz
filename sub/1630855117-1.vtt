00:38.299 --> 00:41.693
This is Alex McAllister
to Mission Control.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.826
It is 0900 hours on Mars,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.090
and the temperature's
a balmy negative 40 degrees.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.223
Wind speed, mild 5 knots,

00:49.397 --> 00:53.488
and the radiation reading is
on track for an annual 200 mSv.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.925
Final numbers should be
coming in through shortly,

00:56.099 --> 00:59.407
but all in all, it is a good day
to be on Mars.

01:00.364 --> 01:01.539
Over and out.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.459
This is Mars.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.723
This will be the first colony
on Mars.

01:11.897 --> 01:14.683
When we were young, my brother
and I would stare at the stars

01:14.857 --> 01:17.903
and dream of the day
we became astronauts.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.210
And now that day is here.

01:20.384 --> 01:23.953
I'm going to Mars to write
mankind's next chapter.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.652
I will travel there in this.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.960
And then this will be my home.

01:31.134 --> 01:34.181
This is where
I'll work, explore,

01:34.355 --> 01:35.747
marry,

01:36.574 --> 01:37.967
pioneer,

01:38.576 --> 01:39.969
and die.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.278
Mars is where I'll die.

03:18.894 --> 03:21.462
Honey, it's not gonna hurt you
if you look away
for two minutes.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.725
It won't. People will.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.684
-Oh, come on. I don't get
to see you that often.
-Mom,

03:26.858 --> 03:29.687
-I've been busy.
-Oh, you're here already.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.603
-Hi, Lizzie.
-Hi, Dad.

03:32.777 --> 03:35.084
Ugh. Wash your hands first, Dad.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.477
Get any sleep?

03:38.696 --> 03:41.438
Walls are low. I'm gonna have
to start trucking in water soon.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.135
Or it's time to sell.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.226
What? You said yourself.
A drought is coming.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.402
-You need
to get out of here.
-Nope.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.534
I need someone to take over.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.754
-Hey, can you flip that one?
-Mm-hmm.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.017
Clouds cleared. Hey.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.715
Were you outside?

03:58.586 --> 03:59.891
Hey, thanks for coming.

04:01.153 --> 04:04.896
Uh, yeah,
anything I can do to fulfill
your unreasonable demands.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.333
It was a request.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.900
-Mom made it a demand.
-I did not.

04:09.074 --> 04:12.121
Well, I'm grateful you made
the impossible journey
from the city.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.297
-Alexander.
-That's fine, Mom.
I didn't hear him.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.995
-You need me to text it to you?
-Would that mean I can leave?

04:17.169 --> 04:20.738
-Elizabeth.
-Uh, Mom, stop coddling him.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.697
-I don't coddle him.
-Can I start?

04:22.871 --> 04:24.655
Oh, yes.
Sorry, sorry. Elizabeth.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.353
-Okay.
-Shh, shh. Come on, settle.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.877
Okay, here we go.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.535
So, I asked you all here
for a reason.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.319
-Mm-hmm.
-You need a lift?

04:36.841 --> 04:38.669
-Oh, Mom.
-Sorry.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.193
I will not be returning
to engineering.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.632
Oh, God, just don't tell me
it's a food truck.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.895
I got through to the next round.

04:47.069 --> 04:50.333
-Oh.
-Next round of what?

04:50.507 --> 04:52.074
The Mission Mars Space Program.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.119
Um, what the hell is that?

04:55.556 --> 04:57.471
I'm going to Mars.

04:58.776 --> 04:59.603
Mars?

05:01.605 --> 05:02.606
The planet?

05:03.564 --> 05:06.044
Yep, and it's a one-way journey,

05:06.218 --> 05:10.222
so I wanted to tell you all
as soon as I knew for sure.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.876
I'm sorry. Are we joking?

05:13.443 --> 05:16.011
No, I'm, I'm going to Mars.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.709
-Like with NASA?
-No.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.450
NASA's still, like,
20 years out.

05:20.624 --> 05:21.669
We're gonna be going in ten.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.932
I'm gonna start training soon,

05:24.106 --> 05:25.586
um, in isolation.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.284
So, I wanted to make sure
that we all spend

05:28.458 --> 05:30.765
some time together
before that happens.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.332
-You really believe this?
-Knock, knock.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.551
-The film crew.
-The what?

05:34.725 --> 05:36.205
They wanna interview me
for the news.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.946
They, they actually wanna
talk to you guys too.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.252
-What-- other people
know about this?
-Hi.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.342
-Uh, come in. Uh, I'm Alex.
-Mm.

05:42.516 --> 05:46.998
Lisa Kessler, NBC Local News 5.
Where can we set up?

05:47.172 --> 05:48.478
-Uh, just over there
in the backyard.
-Um,

05:48.652 --> 05:50.350
-hi. Lisa Kessler.
-Hello.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.874
-Hi.
-This is so cute. Okay, great.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.789
This is really charming.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.965
It's them? Oh.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.663
Um, uh...

05:59.837 --> 06:01.448
Oh, I think I could get
an Instagram shot here.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.754
You let this happen. Dad?

06:03.928 --> 06:05.190
He's an adult, Liz.

06:05.843 --> 06:06.888
He's lost it.

06:08.324 --> 06:09.673
Liz, after the accident,

06:09.847 --> 06:12.589
he spent months
just lying in his room,

06:12.763 --> 06:15.026
and now he gets up early.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.854
He goes outside.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.204
-So does it really matter why.
-Of course it matters.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.772
Well, how do you know
this isn't real?

06:21.946 --> 06:24.122
This is a private company.
They have means.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.733
Means to get to Mars?

06:25.907 --> 06:27.735
Do you have any idea
what that would cost?

06:27.909 --> 06:30.781
-What kind of technology
they would need?
-Well, no, but he does.

06:30.955 --> 06:33.001
And he's excited,
and he's happy.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.220
-Dad.
-I'm gonna get back to work.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.311
-You need to let Alex do this.
-Why?

06:39.486 --> 06:42.402
Because whatever gets him
out of bed in the morning,
we will support.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.839
We will all support him.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.232
Mom, what will people
think of us?

06:48.408 --> 06:51.498
Well, your father asked him
not to name the farm.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.325
Mom, I think
it's a little bit late for that.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.066
Well, then why don't you
help him?

06:55.240 --> 06:58.243
Hey, they want a photo of me
as a kid.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.768
I was supposed to be
on vacation.

07:01.595 --> 07:04.685
-You think
one of these will work?
-No, not that.

07:04.859 --> 07:08.297
Look, you will refer
any interview requests to me.

07:08.471 --> 07:12.083
You will not say,
you will not think a word
without my approval, okay?

07:12.257 --> 07:15.260
-I don't need a PR person.
-Alex, let her.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.828
-All right, Alex.
-Hi, Liz. Bailey & Co PR.

07:18.002 --> 07:20.701
-Let's go over the questions.
-Oh, okay. Great.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.501
-Okay, three, five.
-Get two.

07:38.675 --> 07:39.981
-Morning, Alex.
-Hey, guys.

07:40.155 --> 07:40.895
Nice day.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.462
Freeze!

07:42.636 --> 07:44.986
Put your weapons down
and your hands up.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.902
She said weapons down
and hands up!

07:50.948 --> 07:54.082
-I'm a civilian.
-State your name.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.823
Alexander McAllister.

07:55.997 --> 07:59.087
-Your purpose?
-Supply pick up.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.697
Denied.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.307
-Stop, Blake.
-What the...

08:02.482 --> 08:04.222
Shh, shh, guys, be quiet.

08:06.181 --> 08:09.706
Are these marshmallows?
You're throwing marshmallows?

08:09.880 --> 08:11.969
No, no, I'm...

08:12.143 --> 08:13.667
-All right, let's see
what you got now.
-Ah.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.106
There are mini marshmallows,
technically.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.630
-Oh, my God. Okay, so that makes
it totally normal then.
-No.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.284
It, um--
That's not what I'm saying.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.895
Just that...

08:25.853 --> 08:27.942
Um...

08:31.293 --> 08:32.337
Mini.

08:33.643 --> 08:37.342
Oh, swinging a miss.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.519
Slow news day, guys?

08:41.521 --> 08:43.000
You still have one...

08:44.349 --> 08:45.525
...in your...

08:46.656 --> 08:48.484
Missed one. Ah.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.225
Ah.

08:52.314 --> 08:53.576
Thank you.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.971
You, you know
there's kids up there, right?

08:57.145 --> 08:58.538
-I'm...
-Really?

08:59.103 --> 09:02.585
'Cause all I see
are highly-trained
military operatives.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.460
Smooth.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.724
Thanks, Blake.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.204
That's Commander Leehe
to you, son.

09:15.032 --> 09:15.946
Okay.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.604
What am I supposed to say?
I don't...

09:28.524 --> 09:30.613
What family
is dahlia pinnata from?

09:30.787 --> 09:32.441
-Asteraceae.
-Hm.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.051
Yeah.

09:34.225 --> 09:37.402
And what weeds
are in that same family? Alex?

09:38.012 --> 09:39.579
I'm not doing this, Dad.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.988
Hey, What's up, Cosmonaut?

09:58.162 --> 10:00.600
-Hey, man, did you get in?
-You know it.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.385
-We're on our way, bro.
-Oh, I wish it were tomorrow.

10:03.559 --> 10:05.692
Ugh! We'd be the first in line.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.781
Oh, hey, did you see
the press conference?

10:07.955 --> 10:09.826
They say we'll even be able to
watch the Super Bowl up there.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.002
I don't even watch
the Super Bowl now.

10:12.176 --> 10:15.179
Well, you will when we're
on Mars, brother. Trust me.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.660
Packs Nation.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.054
Hey, any news
on training sites yet?

10:20.228 --> 10:22.230
Nah. I'm still betting
on Antarctica though.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.535
It's the closest
to the real thing.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.016
God, I can't wait.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.280
-All right. Over.
-See you, man.

10:37.898 --> 10:38.768
There you go.

10:40.509 --> 10:41.858
There's three more.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.034
Dimitri?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.428
Can you help me with this?

10:47.081 --> 10:49.300
Finally, my time to shine.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.044
Okay, so I need you
to hold this on here.

10:54.218 --> 10:57.134
-Yep.
-I'm gonna fix these.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.397
What does he do?

10:59.571 --> 11:01.878
Um, ideally, it will

11:02.662 --> 11:04.576
germinate seeds
using Martian soil.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.491
But Martian soil is useless now.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.102
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.843
The winters in Russia
are the same.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.497
It is impossible to grow plants.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.587
But somehow life finds a way.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.372
That is from Jurassic Park.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.070
It's an old Russian pro-- No.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.768
Wait, it is from Jurassic Park.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.291
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.779
Oh, oh. Oh, boy.

11:32.953 --> 11:36.217
Does not work at all,
and it's burning my face.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.523
Good practice for space, no?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.395
This is what it would be like
when you disintegrate

11:40.569 --> 11:42.266
because you accidentally
open a window.

11:43.964 --> 11:46.531
Still need you, Dimitri.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.447
-I--
-All right.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.669
Now to Space News.
Oh.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.671
Boy, you don't
hear that enough.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.673
Well, privately funded company
Mission Mars has announced

11:57.847 --> 12:01.198
its final candidates in a race
to colonize the planet.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.766
That's right, Steve.
The incredibly ambitious,

12:03.940 --> 12:06.334
perhaps impossible goal
of the program

12:06.508 --> 12:09.641
is to get humans
on Mars by 2028...

12:10.686 --> 12:14.559
...decades ahead of NASA,
SpaceX, and Virgin Galactic.

12:14.734 --> 12:19.521
Mission Mars believes they can
by making it a one-way journey,

12:19.695 --> 12:23.568
thereby cutting in half
the supplies needed
for a round trip.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.484
-Hmm, you're saying
there's no return?
-Yes.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.836
Colonists will bid farewell
to their friends,

12:30.010 --> 12:32.795
family and lives here
to participate.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.884
You'd hope
you'd like your coworkers.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.712
Oh, fingers crossed.

12:38.235 --> 12:42.457
Who would volunteer to move
to a place so uninhabitable,

12:42.631 --> 12:46.374
its atmosphere and temperatures
would kill you in an instant?

12:46.548 --> 12:49.420
Alex McAllister,
who I spoke to earlier.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.815
Alex, do you really plan
to leave Earth forever?

12:52.989 --> 12:56.297
Without a second thought.
Lisa, I'm very excited.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.690
But can you even grasp
what you're giving up?

12:58.865 --> 13:02.172
You're relinquishing
your whole life to this program.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.828
Well, I think some people
may see it as giving up a life,

13:06.002 --> 13:09.179
whereas I see it
as choosing a new one.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.442
-Hm.
-Great. He seems
like he's in a cult.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.617
No, he--

13:12.792 --> 13:14.184
If you have kids up there,

13:14.924 --> 13:16.273
are they Martians?

13:17.274 --> 13:20.451
You know, I su--
I suppose they would be.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.326
-Whoo.
It takes all kinds.
-It does.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.505
Saw you on the news last night.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.899
-Yeah, it's pretty good, right?
-Attack!

13:35.118 --> 13:37.642
Keep moving, citizen.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.786
...coms team to mission control.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.400
-Mr. McAllister?
-Oh.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.972
So, this is how
you greet people?

14:04.669 --> 14:07.237
Only when I'm trying
to make a good impression.

14:07.803 --> 14:11.328
Okay, well, I'm Daisy,
and I'm going to be
handling your insurance.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.722
Oh, okay. Where's Mike?

14:13.896 --> 14:16.551
He asked me to sit down
with you. I hope that's okay.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.206
Ye-- Yeah, yeah. A-- Absolutely.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.904
-Screw Mike.
-He's my uncle.

14:22.949 --> 14:26.604
-He never mentioned you.
-Must be deeply ashamed of me.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.870
What can I do for you,
Mr. McAllister?

14:31.479 --> 14:33.785
-Oh, Alex.
-Alex.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.527
Uh, I need
a life insurance policy.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.486
Okay. What's the purpose?

14:39.139 --> 14:41.793
-I'm going to Mars.
-Okay.

14:41.968 --> 14:45.667
So, we'll just need our
interplanetary template then.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.234
Great.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.370
-Mars?
-Yes.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.200
-How?
-The Mission Mars Space Program.

15:00.203 --> 15:03.163
Okay. Wow. All right.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.600
Mars.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.210
Mars.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.519
I ironically don't have
a template for that,

15:11.693 --> 15:15.044
but we could just start
with our standard form.

15:16.828 --> 15:17.873
Um, okay.

15:24.532 --> 15:25.620
Why are you going?

15:26.838 --> 15:28.536
You know,
no one ever asks me that.

15:29.102 --> 15:29.929
I am.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.933
Uh, because it's Mars.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.938
-And?
-Oh, and, and we know next
to nothing about the universe,

15:39.112 --> 15:41.331
and we're not gonna
figure it out from here.
We have to explore.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.855
You know, if we get to Mars,
maybe we'll find some answers.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.730
I know it sounds crazy...

15:49.905 --> 15:53.778
...but walking on the moon
also seemed impossible
until it happened.

15:54.823 --> 15:58.870
Everything that we know,
everything that makes us great

15:59.045 --> 16:02.396
was once an insane idea.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.922
It doesn't sound insane
when you say it like that.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.275
And plus, we're not gonna be
able to live here much longer.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.842
Gonna have to start
looking at other options.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.844
I mean, we've completely
destroyed this planet.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.846
And back to grim reality.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.895
Did you just move here?

16:25.419 --> 16:26.942
It's a small town.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.770
Yeah, I did.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.513
Why?

16:32.687 --> 16:36.386
Sometimes you wake up
with this burning desire
to be an insurance salesman,

16:36.560 --> 16:38.998
and you'll do anything
to make that dream a reality.

16:46.527 --> 16:47.745
I wanted to be a swimmer.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.140
What happened?

16:52.359 --> 16:54.578
A lot of other people did too.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.016
Hmm. I'm a terrible swimmer.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.887
Then at least I'll beat you.

17:07.287 --> 17:10.507
I, uh, I may have some follow-up
questions if that's okay.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.161
Um, y-- yeah.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.858
Got any plans tonight?

17:14.033 --> 17:16.252
I'm studying the composition
of Martian dirt.

17:16.861 --> 17:17.949
Me too.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.606
I'm just kidding. I'm just
watching TV.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.134
Well, h-- have a swell night.

17:33.356 --> 17:34.836
-Hey, how did it go?
-Here he comes.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.011
Ah!

17:36.185 --> 17:37.273
Is he for real?

17:37.447 --> 17:39.754
He's always been a little odd.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.757
Listen, we can't insure him
if this is nonsense,

17:42.931 --> 17:45.542
but his family's been
a part of the community
for generations,

17:45.716 --> 17:48.545
and, frankly, they've had
a rough time recently.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.808
We owe it to them
to look into it.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.854
I know it's not
part of your job description,
but do you think--

17:53.028 --> 17:54.943
-No, I'll do it.
-Yeah?

17:55.117 --> 17:58.425
-Yeah.
-All right. Good night.

17:58.990 --> 17:59.948
Night.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.564
She's saying
when you say her name,

18:50.738 --> 18:53.871
she will run through
the flames to you.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.526
Peace will prevail.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.528
There will be peace
because you said her name?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.095
And fire.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.792
Peace and fire.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.232
It's the girl.

19:07.537 --> 19:10.149
Wow, this is beautiful.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.415
Hello.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.288
Hi.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.206
-Oh, I think I hear
your father...
-Yes.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.381
Mother, I--

19:29.559 --> 19:32.301
-So you live in a flower farm?
-Yeah, flowers everywhere.

19:33.302 --> 19:36.131
-Any daisies?
-No, daisies are weeds.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.089
Thank you.

19:38.655 --> 19:41.963
Well, uh, sorry to just show up.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.704
I just had
a couple more questions,

19:43.878 --> 19:44.879
and you didn't leave
a phone number.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.402
I don't have a phone.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.884
Part of preparing for isolation.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.061
Right, of course. Isolation.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.716
Well, we can underwrite
a policy,

19:55.890 --> 19:59.720
but since this is
such a unique situation,

19:59.894 --> 20:02.940
I just need
a couple more details
so I can come up with a plan.

20:03.114 --> 20:06.466
Okay. I'm actually heading
somewhere right now.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.425
-I'm late for something.
-Oh, okay.

20:09.991 --> 20:13.734
It's just a, a local
first aid course at the school.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.259
-Dimitri usually
helps me out with it.
-Can't tonight,

20:17.433 --> 20:19.218
so busy.

20:19.392 --> 20:20.697
All of the plans.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.919
Um, but you, you could come

20:25.963 --> 20:29.750
if you want. I mean,
it would answer some
of your questions probably.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.360
You're learning first aid
for space.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.710
Yes, just locally at the moment,

20:33.884 --> 20:36.757
but they'll put us through
a full training course
later down the line.

20:36.931 --> 20:37.888
Right.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.414
But I, I have to go right now.

20:41.979 --> 20:44.721
Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.636
-Yeah.
-Great, great.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.900
-Yeah. Oh.
-Yeah, yeah, sorry.
I gotta take these to the front.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.554
Yeah, take your time.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.905
All right, CPR Warriors.
Picture this.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.604
Your cousin has jumped
into the pool, can't swim,

20:57.778 --> 21:00.563
and is now drowning.
You must resuscitate her.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.349
Begin.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.525
And for you, Alex,

21:05.699 --> 21:07.483
Daisy here has taken
her helmet off for too long.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.224
Oh, then she'd be dead
instantly.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.356
Why?

21:10.834 --> 21:12.532
Because
there's very little oxygen.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.708
Well, let's say there is oxygen.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.318
There isn't. She'd be dead.

21:16.492 --> 21:20.104
Then, say,
she fell into a pool, too,

21:20.279 --> 21:22.019
but the pool is on Mars.

21:22.193 --> 21:23.412
Resuscitate her.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.678
All right, everyone,
remember, CPR.

21:28.852 --> 21:31.681
-Am I supposed
to be drowning? Okay.
-Um, yeah.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.988
I'm so sorry.
I did not realize

21:34.162 --> 21:36.295
-we were doing CPR tonight.
-Good job, Scott.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.471
-You have to watch
the angle of the neck.
-Sure, you didn't.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.124
-Hm.
-Alex.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.389
She's dying. Save her now.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.305
Hm, and, uh...

21:46.957 --> 21:50.047
-This...
-That's great.
Everyone pushing.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.658
Uh...

21:52.354 --> 21:53.312
All right, over the lungs.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.574
Thanks.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.795
Then I do the thing
with the mouth.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.493
That's great.
Uh, that makes sense.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.277
Um, okay.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.801
And then this part. Okay.

22:06.934 --> 22:07.717
-Oh.
-Oh,

22:07.891 --> 22:08.762
you're doing it wrong.

22:08.936 --> 22:10.241
How about I just show you?

22:10.416 --> 22:11.373
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

22:12.548 --> 22:13.462
No, I--

22:14.071 --> 22:16.422
-I was a swimmer, remember?
-Right, yup.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.385
-Okay.
-You're all doing great.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.735
Just another two minutes to go.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.389
Check the pulse.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.827
-Okay.
-Bravo, Daisy.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.829
After surviving a near drowning,

22:33.003 --> 22:34.440
she has pulled Alex
from the water...

22:34.614 --> 22:36.616
...and now saved his life.

22:41.316 --> 22:43.100
Is this an art room?

22:43.274 --> 22:46.060
Sorry. I thought we'd be tying
bandages or something.

22:46.234 --> 22:48.932
Yeah, you said that
already twice. Oh.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.501
There are some
real Picassos in here.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.417
This is my favorite subject.

22:55.896 --> 22:56.853
Nice.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.684
Really? I thought
you would be more quantitative.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.991
Math and science?

23:05.035 --> 23:08.387
Yeah, don't get me wrong.
I was great at those.

23:09.953 --> 23:10.824
All right.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.179
Do you still swim?

23:18.353 --> 23:20.137
Never.

23:20.311 --> 23:21.748
But it was your life.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.838
Yep, and now it's not.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.020
Well, it always helps
to remember that

23:33.194 --> 23:34.891
we're just living on a rock,
hurtling through space,

23:35.065 --> 23:37.459
and our meaningless existence
can end at any moment.

23:37.633 --> 23:38.939
Doesn't it keep me
warm at night?

23:39.679 --> 23:41.158
Sorry.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.168
I'm gonna give a talk
to the kids here next week.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.258
About space? Can I come?

23:54.955 --> 23:55.825
Why?

23:55.999 --> 23:57.261
Maybe I wanna learn more

23:57.436 --> 23:59.089
about my meaningless existence.

24:01.614 --> 24:02.658
Okay.

24:03.572 --> 24:06.314
Sure, yeah,
then you should come.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.581
She's just doing my insurance.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.888
A woman named Martha
does my insurance.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.107
-Have you heard me
talk about her?
-No.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.023
Yeah, that's 'cause
Martha is a hoarder

24:20.197 --> 24:22.025
who dresses like
she died on the Titanic.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.463
-Hm.
-You gotta take
these opportunities

24:24.637 --> 24:25.768
when they fall in your lap, bro.

24:26.552 --> 24:27.640
It's not like that.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.119
Make it like that.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.591
No, no, no, no.
Do not let Colin do it.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.462
He'll try and poach
the entire...

25:08.898 --> 25:10.552
Okay, look, I'll type
something up tonight,
and you're gonna say

25:10.726 --> 25:13.033
that you did it because I'm,
I'm not losing that account.

25:13.729 --> 25:14.904
Okay.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.127
What's Peter doing here?

25:20.301 --> 25:22.172
I asked him
to appraise the farm.

25:24.392 --> 25:27.308
-Get him off my property.
-When he's done.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.179
I told you I'm not selling.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.748
Yeah, I know, and I think
you should reconsider.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.751
Well, it's not your farm,
Elizabeth.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.231
You don't get to make the call.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.233
Dad, you can't keep
going like this.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.017
You're working yourself
to the bone.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.672
I'm fine. I have Dimitri.

25:44.630 --> 25:45.674
Really? He's not enough.

25:45.848 --> 25:48.285
Alex helps.

25:48.459 --> 25:51.201
Only when he's not off
pretending to board spaceships.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.597
Mom can't even finish a bouquet.

25:57.251 --> 25:59.383
How are profits
without, uh, flower design?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.779
This isn't sustainable, Dad.
You should be retired.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.825
I'll retire
when I hand the farm over.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.391
Over to whom?

26:08.349 --> 26:09.785
Look, I know
you had a plan before,

26:09.959 --> 26:11.831
but you don't have
a successor anymore.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.181
You need a new plan.

26:14.964 --> 26:17.576
-Maybe seeing
some figures will help.
-It's not about the money, Liz.

26:17.750 --> 26:20.840
Well, you're not exactly handing
over the Byzantine Empire, okay?

26:21.014 --> 26:24.583
They're just flowers.
They don't do anything.
They don't really matter.

26:28.064 --> 26:30.719
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to agree to disagree there.

26:32.939 --> 26:35.158
How can you
even stand to be here?

26:36.203 --> 26:37.465
He's everywhere.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.818
I'm not selling.
It will go to a developer.

26:42.992 --> 26:46.387
And if we continue
down that path,
there will be no farms left.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.477
We'll have to import even more
from halfway around the globe.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.479
No, Liz, we,

26:52.480 --> 26:54.047
we gotta hold on to our farms.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.049
This is our spot.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.313
It's our little corner
of the world...

27:00.662 --> 27:02.011
...and I'm not giving it up.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.274
Send Peter home.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.713
Don't you dare
show me the value.

27:19.725 --> 27:23.380
For 210 days,
I'm gonna travel there in this,

27:23.554 --> 27:27.384
and then, this will be my home.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.779
This is where
I'll work, explore,

27:31.345 --> 27:34.435
marry, pioneer...

27:35.784 --> 27:37.351
...and die.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.659
Mars is where I'll die.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.488
And this is for children?

27:45.054 --> 27:45.968
Yeah.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.884
And you must end on dying.

27:49.058 --> 27:51.495
That is how it ends.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.802
But you really want to bring
that up to first graders?

27:54.455 --> 27:57.414
-Second graders.
-Maybe you should talk
more of space adventures.

27:58.067 --> 28:01.505
Like discovering aliens,
or, or, or racing rovers.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.029
Oh, oh. Oh.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.379
Playing basketball.

28:06.554 --> 28:07.773
That's Space Jam.

28:07.947 --> 28:08.904
Ah, yes.

28:10.514 --> 28:12.386
I do not think
they would realize this though.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.649
But that's not real, Dimitri.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.347
Well, this is
not yet real either.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.871
But it will be.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.438
That's the difference.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.440
Let me see it again.

28:25.181 --> 28:28.010
So, they're sending you to Mars,

28:28.489 --> 28:31.274
but they only care
about my medical opinion.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.624
I don't usually work for NASA.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.452
Well, you were approved.

28:35.626 --> 28:39.369
How? I deal in flu shots
and diaper rash.

28:40.457 --> 28:42.764
You need the kind of doctor
that doesn't have these
on their desk.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.985
Well, I, I mean,
how do you know that
NASA doesn't have lollipops?

28:46.159 --> 28:47.987
Some wild guess.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.859
Okay.
Just the standard physical.

28:51.033 --> 28:53.557
Great.
It will be easy, you know.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.559
-You still disease free?
-Mm-hmm.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.910
Open. Close.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.827
-Any alcohol or drug habits?
-Uh-uh.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.786
Hmm. You know, they didn't
even ask for a TB test.

29:06.309 --> 29:09.138
They have one of those
just to move countries.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.837
I'm sure they will at, at some
point down the line though.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.360
Hmm.

29:17.451 --> 29:20.454
-Oh, your joints are fit
for space travel.
-Great.

29:20.628 --> 29:22.673
-Ten years might be
a whole other story.
-Right.

29:22.848 --> 29:26.373
Oh, I'm, I'm-- I'll be
all right. I'm keeping fit.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.465
-How's your mental health?
-It's fine.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.946
No, you don't get
to decide that.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.774
Just how are you feeling?

29:36.426 --> 29:37.732
Fantastic.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.256
You willing to see
a psychologist to confirm that?

29:40.430 --> 29:41.780
Nah.

29:42.519 --> 29:46.219
So you're asking me to sign off
on your psych evaluation
as well?

29:47.263 --> 29:49.439
-Yep.
-Hmm.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.617
It's nice of you
to support him.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.229
I wanna make sure he doesn't
say anything unhinged.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.057
This is so irresponsible.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.710
They're children.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.191
He's not telling them
unicorns exist, Lizzie.

30:02.365 --> 30:03.497
Hmm.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.586
Oh, just in time. There he is.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.763
I'm so proud of you.
This is such a good thing

30:08.937 --> 30:10.678
that you're doing.
This is so good.

30:11.548 --> 30:12.985
Ah, you're on vacation.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.336
Uh, well, sometimes
inferior colleagues use that
as an opportunity

30:16.510 --> 30:19.556
to attempt coups
on your accounts.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.080
Okay,
so when I'm with my clients,

30:21.254 --> 30:23.125
I tell them
to stick to the story.

30:23.299 --> 30:24.823
-Hm.
-And your story is space.

30:25.388 --> 30:29.001
Not you in space,
because that's a hypothetical,

30:29.175 --> 30:30.306
but space.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.656
But I'm going to space.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.747
Do you think we could
just keep it to what's real
right now though?

30:36.922 --> 30:38.097
Are we paying you for this?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.751
Could you, please,
just teach them facts?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.666
And when you have a shuttle
and a launch date,

30:42.841 --> 30:44.843
you can come back
and tell them about the mission.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.192
Yeah, sure.

30:46.932 --> 30:49.717
-What are you looking at?
-Well, someone might come

30:50.239 --> 30:53.503
-Yeah, it is how hallways work.
-No, someone I invited.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.723
Okay. Focus.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.336
All right.

31:01.381 --> 31:04.036
I, I heard you guys were
learning about the solar system.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.602
This is making me sleepy.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.346
Can I get out of this class?

31:10.520 --> 31:14.046
Um, you guys
got a favorite planet?

31:14.220 --> 31:17.484
-Stupid planets.
-This is so boring.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.228
How about this? Everybody up.

31:22.402 --> 31:24.012
All right. Wow.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.536
We're just gonna
have you sit over there.

31:28.712 --> 31:29.888
Okay.

31:34.109 --> 31:38.331
Okay. Blake, if you could go
to the center of the room.

31:39.723 --> 31:42.988
You are going to be the sun.

31:43.684 --> 31:45.599
The center of our solar system.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.688
Everybody orbits around you.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.255
Hi.

31:50.299 --> 31:51.822
Could you stand near Blake?

31:52.954 --> 31:56.349
Now, you are
going to be Mercury.

31:56.523 --> 32:00.962
It only takes you
88 days to orbit Blake,

32:01.136 --> 32:03.747
so you're gonna be
moving kinda quickly

32:03.922 --> 32:06.272
like this.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.362
-Only 88 days?
-Perfect.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.147
-Who wants to be Venus?
-Me, me, me.

32:12.321 --> 32:14.367
You. Great. Up.

32:14.541 --> 32:17.718
Okay, so you are
second closest to the sun

32:17.892 --> 32:19.633
and the brightest planet, okay?

32:19.807 --> 32:23.376
You're gonna orbit like that.

32:26.857 --> 32:30.905
-Now, who would
like to be Earth?
-I do.

32:31.079 --> 32:35.475
Every time you go
all the way around Blake,

32:35.997 --> 32:39.261
it has been an entire year.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.656
Louie, you're gonna
be the moon, okay?

32:42.830 --> 32:46.007
You're going to orbit Earth.
Now, go.

32:46.660 --> 32:47.748
Fantastic.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.363
Mars, Mars, Mars. Mars.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.150
Okay. Mars is where
we'll live in the future.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.630
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, let's go.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.373
-You guys getting dizzy yet?
-No!

33:04.547 --> 33:07.028
If everyone else could just come
and surround our planets.

33:07.202 --> 33:09.596
You're gonna be the stars
in the Milky Way galaxy.

33:09.770 --> 33:12.599
Now, there are billions
and billions of you.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.341
-So imagine...
-Elizabeth, take the star.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.518
And that's the solar system.

33:22.957 --> 33:23.827
Hi.

33:25.264 --> 33:26.134
Hi.

33:28.789 --> 33:33.489
Okay, well, there's 100 billion
stars in the Milky Way galaxy,

33:33.663 --> 33:36.188
and there's maybe 10 trillion
galaxies in the universe.

33:36.362 --> 33:39.800
If you multiply that
by 100 billion, you get
an extremely rough,

33:39.974 --> 33:42.411
probably low estimate for
the amount of stars that exist.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.630
Which is?

33:44.239 --> 33:46.241
It's a 1 with 24 zeros after it.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.897
We make the mistake of thinking
that the universe is for us,

33:50.071 --> 33:51.203
but it's not. It's--

33:51.377 --> 33:53.074
-It's--
-Okay. New rule.

33:53.248 --> 33:56.425
Every time you mention how
meaningless our existence is,

33:56.599 --> 33:59.602
I'm gonna need another drink,
and you have to join me.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.214
-Right.
-Come on.

34:03.302 --> 34:04.607
Right. Uh...

34:10.831 --> 34:13.964
It-- uh, oh, gosh, it's right--
No, I have it.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.054
-I had it. Um...
-Okay.

34:18.491 --> 34:20.493
-Dais.
-No.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.496
-Dee-Dee.
-Don't you dare.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.150
What?

34:25.324 --> 34:27.413
Look, I know that
Daisy is a tricky one.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.719
I mean, my coaches
used to call me Zee.

34:29.893 --> 34:32.374
-Mm-hmm.
-As in Lazy Daisy.

34:32.853 --> 34:35.073
Especially when I couldn't
make my time.

34:36.204 --> 34:39.425
It hurt a little.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.731
You must miss it.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.125
-Swimming?
-Yeah.

34:44.299 --> 34:47.346
Yeah, it was my purpose,

34:47.520 --> 34:52.742
and, um, now, I just don't know
where I belong.

34:53.874 --> 34:56.703
I don't know what to do
with the hours in the day.

34:56.877 --> 35:00.620
I don't know what to do
on this planet.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.188
I don't know what to do
with my hands.

35:04.537 --> 35:07.105
-I don't know.
-Nobody's good
at just one thing.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.281
-Yeah.
-You're really good
at first aid.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.719
But you don't love it.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.027
Oh, my gosh, it's the Martian.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.813
-What?
-Your nickname.

35:19.987 --> 35:21.162
Is it too on the nose?

35:21.336 --> 35:23.295
It feels obvious,
but it's so good.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.340
Okay.

35:25.514 --> 35:28.082
Well, I--
it beats the current one.

35:28.256 --> 35:29.344
Which is?

35:29.518 --> 35:31.041
Alexander the Great.

35:31.738 --> 35:33.131
Really?

35:33.305 --> 35:36.351
Yeah, we were named
after historical figures.

35:37.352 --> 35:40.790
Elizabeth, Thomas, Alexander.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.097
So the conqueror,
the queen, and the inventor.

35:43.271 --> 35:44.142
Yep.

35:45.795 --> 35:48.624
That's, like, not too much
to live up to.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.626
Oh, no, not at all.
He had just conquered

35:50.800 --> 35:52.802
half the known world
by the time he was 32.

35:52.976 --> 35:56.197
So, you've got time.
I mean, he didn't go to Mars.

35:56.371 --> 35:59.548
It was not like
they could fathom that
there were even other planets.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.202
-You can't--
-All right. Bartender!

36:01.376 --> 36:02.464
Bar--

36:02.638 --> 36:04.771
-Oh, wow.
-That's a storm.

36:05.380 --> 36:08.383
-Um, you don't have
to walk me home.
-Wow.

36:08.557 --> 36:11.212
No, I, I'm not afraid
of the rain.

36:11.386 --> 36:13.606
-I'll see you later.
-Nah, just like
that is fine.

36:13.780 --> 36:16.696
At least you won't have to worry
about rain on Mars. Whoa.

36:17.436 --> 36:21.440
No, just solar flares
that cause storms that lasts
for hundreds of years.

36:21.614 --> 36:22.919
Okay. When I said
I didn't need you

36:23.093 --> 36:25.052
to walk me home,
I meant literally.

36:25.705 --> 36:26.619
It's so close.

36:27.968 --> 36:29.491
This is a building site.

36:30.144 --> 36:33.060
It is rustic,
and Mike is fixing it up.

36:35.062 --> 36:37.630
Well, have a slow night.

36:39.849 --> 36:41.242
That is funny.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.766
Um, I...

37:11.141 --> 37:12.708
-Bedroom.
-What?

37:13.187 --> 37:14.797
-Bedroom.
-Oh.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.627
-Oh, yeah.
-Wait. Come here.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.371
Through the door, you barbarian.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.124
Um, I just-- um...

37:38.473 --> 37:39.561
Is this okay?

37:40.780 --> 37:42.303
-Yeah.
-Okay.

38:41.362 --> 38:44.017
That was the first rain
we've had in a month.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.933
Great. Uh, have you looked
into this Mars company?

38:47.455 --> 38:50.153
If you're gonna follow me
around, at least help.

38:50.980 --> 38:53.809
Well, if you're gonna refuse
to sell, at least
prepare for the drought.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.029
How am I supposed
to do that?

38:56.203 --> 38:58.423
For one, switch
to drought-resistant varieties.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.773
Get a more efficient
irrigation system.

39:00.947 --> 39:02.427
And next year,
only irrigate half the land.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.254
Half the land, half the profits.

39:04.429 --> 39:07.040
Yeah, well, you're losing
half the crops regardless,

39:07.214 --> 39:09.216
if you don't have enough water,
which you won't.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.305
Oh.

39:11.479 --> 39:14.264
It's a bad time to invest
in drip irrigation then.

39:14.439 --> 39:17.833
Actually, it's the perfect time
while we still have reserves.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.315
So you think this Mars thing
might be a scam?

39:21.489 --> 39:22.360
What do you think?

39:24.187 --> 39:25.493
I should show you something.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.016
Come on.

39:36.939 --> 39:39.028
-How long does he spend on this?
-Hours.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.117
You know what this is, right?

39:42.467 --> 39:46.035
It's a very sophisticated
version of the machine
that they built

39:46.209 --> 39:49.038
for the science fair that year
we had a really bad dry season.

39:49.212 --> 39:50.475
Oh, man.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.781
Dad, what are we gonna do?

39:53.260 --> 39:54.740
He's given up on his career.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.743
He's building machines
for another planet.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.876
He's spending all of his money
on merchandise.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.356
He's been to see Dr. Olsen.

40:02.530 --> 40:03.966
What? For what?

40:04.140 --> 40:05.664
His space physical.

40:05.838 --> 40:08.362
Okay. Well, then she knows
that he's insane.

40:08.536 --> 40:10.582
We have to go see her.
Maybe she can help.

40:10.756 --> 40:13.106
-Ah.
-Look, I know
it seems harmless now.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.282
But what if it progresses?

40:15.456 --> 40:17.980
What if we could have helped
and we didn't?

40:21.070 --> 40:22.071
You can't tell your mother.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.422
Okay. I'll get the car.

40:26.902 --> 40:30.776
Doctor-patient confidentiality
means what it sounds like
it means.

40:30.950 --> 40:33.779
-This is different. It's Alex.
-A patient.

40:33.953 --> 40:35.171
You've told me about him before.

40:35.345 --> 40:36.956
Yes, when he was a child.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.262
-Sue, I know
it's breaking protocol.
-The law.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.264
Well, we're concerned.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.005
Doesn't mean
I'm gonna break the law.

40:43.179 --> 40:45.138
Well, I am not leaving.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.010
What if I break out
one of these?

40:49.011 --> 40:51.318
Are your immunizations
up to date?

40:53.189 --> 40:55.627
Oh. Sometimes at night,

40:55.801 --> 40:57.455
I still hear screams
from your measles shot.

40:57.629 --> 41:00.240
Okay. Give us the information,

41:00.414 --> 41:02.634
and you can give me
the tetanus booster.

41:03.722 --> 41:06.028
Your brother is not crazy.

41:06.638 --> 41:09.597
He probably has
a slight delusion, but...

41:09.771 --> 41:12.948
You yourself were once convinced
you were a wizard.

41:13.122 --> 41:14.515
I was ten.

41:14.689 --> 41:17.605
-This is dangerous.
-No, it is not.

41:17.779 --> 41:20.347
So far he's just,
he's just living out a fantasy.

41:20.521 --> 41:23.263
What matters is,
it has given him a purpose.

41:23.437 --> 41:25.265
Wouldn't a job
do the same thing?

41:25.439 --> 41:28.050
Do you know how many
Mensa members are unemployed?

41:28.834 --> 41:30.226
More than you think.

41:30.879 --> 41:35.536
What you have
is an exceptionally
intelligent son, Jeff.

41:37.146 --> 41:39.801
Those types often have
the hardest time coping.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.238
Maybe this is just something
he has to do.

41:42.412 --> 41:44.763
Okay, well, what about the fact
that it's space?

41:45.459 --> 41:47.287
He and Tom were obsessed.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.332
I'm sure it plays a part,

41:49.507 --> 41:51.596
but what would you
have me say to him?

41:53.032 --> 41:54.903
Right, would he even listen?

41:56.731 --> 41:59.952
We all have our distractions.
You have looked at that phone

42:00.126 --> 42:01.388
ten times since you walked in.

42:04.826 --> 42:06.959
Did you ever see the therapist
that I recommended?

42:07.133 --> 42:08.830
I don't have time.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.353
Mm.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.052
Lead a horse to water. Okay.

42:15.402 --> 42:16.534
Sit still.

42:18.884 --> 42:21.234
All right, CPR warriors.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.628
-Hi.
-Oh, um...

42:24.193 --> 42:25.934
-We're about to begin.
-...hi.

42:27.849 --> 42:29.547
-I, I just...
-Wonderful.

42:29.721 --> 42:33.072
I should apologize, uh, I--
About sneaking out.

42:33.246 --> 42:35.596
Oh, the woman that
you hung out with a few times

42:35.770 --> 42:37.467
doesn't want to talk about it,

42:37.642 --> 42:40.645
but the insurance agent
who works for you does.

42:40.819 --> 42:42.037
Okay.

42:42.211 --> 42:43.909
-Things happened.
-I remember.

42:44.779 --> 42:48.000
-It didn't mean anything.
-No, we, we were drunk.

42:48.696 --> 42:49.654
Yeah.

42:51.394 --> 42:53.353
Take your places, lifesavers.

42:57.009 --> 42:59.185
Let's go, people.

42:59.359 --> 43:01.491
-Heimlich maneuver.
-Sorry. So, what are we doing?

43:01.970 --> 43:04.277
-The Heimlich maneuver.
-No, I mean, you and me.

43:06.061 --> 43:07.454
I figured we could be friends.

43:08.237 --> 43:11.066
Really? Okay.
I didn't think you'd want to.

43:12.067 --> 43:13.765
Why? Because you're odd?

43:14.461 --> 43:15.810
Because I'm leaving the planet.

43:16.637 --> 43:18.073
Oh, I don't mind that.

43:19.118 --> 43:20.554
Okay. Then sure, yeah.

43:20.728 --> 43:22.991
Patients, begin choking.

43:23.165 --> 43:24.689
Okay, that was...

43:24.863 --> 43:27.866
-Lifesavers, start your saving.
-Go on.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.651
What, um-- You're not gonna
show me how to do it?

43:30.825 --> 43:32.566
You're on your own, kid.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.481
Don't kill me.

43:49.365 --> 43:51.150
Come on.

43:52.978 --> 43:55.110
Yesterday you were
28 seconds faster.

43:55.284 --> 43:57.112
As you know,
I completely regret this.

44:03.336 --> 44:05.033
We didn't have
fair competitiveness.

44:05.207 --> 44:06.731
What do you think this is?

44:07.993 --> 44:10.386
-Oh, my God. Look.
-Coming in for landing.

44:10.560 --> 44:13.912
Whoa.

44:14.086 --> 44:15.391
Wow.

44:16.131 --> 44:17.916
Hey, there he is.

44:26.838 --> 44:28.840
I didn't know
you could do that.

44:29.014 --> 44:31.581
-Well, it was nice.
-Thank you.

44:31.756 --> 44:33.322
You're gonna help me install
this in the dahlia fields,

44:33.496 --> 44:34.802
or you're gonna be
my nemesis forever.

44:36.891 --> 44:38.676
-Wh...
-It's a drip irrigation system.

44:38.850 --> 44:41.461
That your father
doesn't know you're installing.

44:42.070 --> 44:43.245
Correct.

44:44.507 --> 44:45.944
Okay. Yes,
I'm more scared of you.

44:46.118 --> 44:47.119
Good choice.

44:51.427 --> 44:53.908
They're not
some magical forest thing.

44:54.082 --> 44:55.823
Like, they're not fairies.

44:55.997 --> 44:58.870
But today is the day
when most of them are out.

44:59.479 --> 45:00.959
Come on, we're almost there.

45:03.613 --> 45:05.006
How's living with your family?

45:05.528 --> 45:06.878
We used to get along better.

45:07.052 --> 45:08.009
So did mine.

45:08.749 --> 45:10.185
What happened?

45:10.359 --> 45:12.187
My parents were really,
really good coaches

45:12.361 --> 45:14.189
who suddenly didn't have
anyone to coach.

45:14.363 --> 45:15.321
Just me.

45:16.061 --> 45:17.715
What about yours?

45:19.151 --> 45:20.413
Um...

45:25.592 --> 45:26.680
There was an accident...

45:28.726 --> 45:30.336
...not long ago. That...

45:31.511 --> 45:32.904
...that did it.

45:36.777 --> 45:39.867
My brother saved my life.

45:45.351 --> 45:47.222
Sounds like a pretty great
big brother.

45:47.396 --> 45:48.397
Yeah.

45:50.443 --> 45:51.574
Yeah.

45:54.186 --> 45:55.187
He was.

46:04.979 --> 46:05.850
Are you okay?

46:06.546 --> 46:07.329
Yeah, I'm fine.

46:07.503 --> 46:09.505
I'm... fine.

46:09.679 --> 46:11.072
It's just hot.

46:14.380 --> 46:17.600
So where, where is this
bug family reunion then?

46:19.167 --> 46:20.865
They're still setting up.

46:21.039 --> 46:23.824
DJ was late.
You know how it is.

46:24.607 --> 46:27.045
-Ah.
-Did you kill it?

46:27.219 --> 46:29.699
-No.
-Then where is it?

46:30.265 --> 46:31.353
I don't know.

46:31.527 --> 46:32.441
Oh, wait.

46:33.442 --> 46:34.356
He's fine.

46:34.530 --> 46:35.618
That's not the same one.

46:39.840 --> 46:40.710
Wow.

46:41.407 --> 46:42.277
Wow.

46:45.585 --> 46:48.718
You realize you're getting joy
from a bug's ass lighting up.

46:48.893 --> 46:50.808
Oh, come on. So are you.

46:50.982 --> 46:51.852
No, I'm not.

46:52.940 --> 46:53.941
Yes, you are.

46:54.899 --> 46:56.639
Watch them pretty, pretty butts.

47:03.646 --> 47:05.779
Now, how could you think
about giving all this up?

47:31.805 --> 47:34.155
We're calling it
the Mars Grover.

47:34.329 --> 47:36.070
No, we're not doing that.

47:36.244 --> 47:37.985
-Uh-huh.
-Well, that sounds good.

47:38.159 --> 47:41.380
Anyway, this is how the world
will work in the future

47:41.554 --> 47:42.772
as it gets hotter and drier.

47:42.947 --> 47:45.036
Underground,
self-sustaining farms,

47:45.210 --> 47:48.039
They already have one working in
an old tube station in London.

47:48.213 --> 47:50.084
I just have to figure out
how to make it work.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.391
-On Mars.
-Exactly.

47:52.565 --> 47:54.001
So the International
Space Station

47:54.175 --> 47:55.655
has some seeds growing.

47:55.829 --> 47:58.788
Uh, they even have
some sprouting on the moon.

47:58.963 --> 48:01.748
So, I just need to account for

48:02.531 --> 48:06.274
the lack of atmosphere,
gravity, radiation.

48:06.448 --> 48:08.320
This could go to NASA.

48:08.494 --> 48:10.800
I mean it, Alex.
This, this could be your thing.

48:10.975 --> 48:12.150
They're just

48:12.977 --> 48:14.935
-seeds.
-It's the survival part.

48:15.109 --> 48:17.068
I mean, you could send this
to the Rhode Island
Space Consortium,

48:17.242 --> 48:20.462
and you could get funding
and a team and everything.

48:20.636 --> 48:22.900
Uh, I don't think
it'd be ready for that.

48:24.162 --> 48:26.555
Um, anyways, they could
probably use this inside.

48:33.171 --> 48:35.042
Oh, this looks amazing.

48:35.738 --> 48:38.176
-Dimitri, could you take
the potatoes, please?
-Mm-hmm.

48:38.350 --> 48:39.438
Yes.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.788
In Russia, we call them
kartofel.

48:42.571 --> 48:43.790
Beautiful language.

48:44.747 --> 48:48.012
Yes. Forget about the glory
of the word potato.

48:49.056 --> 48:51.450
Oh, well, could you take
the kartofelthen?

48:51.624 --> 48:52.799
-And, Liz?
-Mom.

48:52.973 --> 48:54.366
-Elizabeth. Lizzie!
-Mom.

48:54.540 --> 48:55.802
-I'm doing something.
-Take the plates, please.

48:55.976 --> 48:57.195
-Can you help me?
-Yes.

48:57.369 --> 48:59.110
-Thank you.
-And come on, please.

48:59.284 --> 49:01.939
-Help me with the tarelki.
-Okay, comrade.

49:04.158 --> 49:05.812
-Well, that's inevitable.
-What?

49:06.813 --> 49:08.728
Those two.

49:08.902 --> 49:11.383
Better chance of Putin
opening a wildlife sanctuary.

49:12.123 --> 49:12.950
I don't know.

49:13.689 --> 49:15.213
He's pretty charming.

49:15.387 --> 49:17.084
He said potatoes
in a different language.

49:17.258 --> 49:18.564
It was charming.

49:20.435 --> 49:21.393
Patata.

49:22.698 --> 49:25.092
-What?
-It's Spanish for potato.

49:25.266 --> 49:27.616
Oh, look, they didn't
even take the potatoes.

49:27.790 --> 49:30.358
-Daisy, could you just
grab those, please?
-Yeah.

49:31.011 --> 49:33.579
Okay, I'll take the patata.

49:35.929 --> 49:37.322
Okay, what can I do?

49:37.496 --> 49:39.411
Uh, well, you could be here
half an hour ago,

49:39.585 --> 49:40.978
or you could take
the green beans.

49:52.337 --> 49:54.208
Where'd you get
that shirt, Dimitri?

49:54.382 --> 49:56.950
I think, um,
from the Salvation Army.

49:57.124 --> 49:59.257
-Mm-hmm.
-Very cheap.

49:59.431 --> 50:01.172
-Well, you wore it well.
-They're good quality.

50:01.346 --> 50:02.303
-... Mars
-Yeah.

50:04.436 --> 50:06.264
-Well, there are many
done. Once in a while...
-Um,

50:06.438 --> 50:08.918
so, Daisy, you seem normal.

50:09.441 --> 50:10.311
Relatively.

50:11.573 --> 50:13.923
-How do you tolerate Alex?
-Uh, Liz?

50:14.750 --> 50:17.014
-He's not the worst.
-Thank you.

50:17.710 --> 50:21.061
You're, uh, you're not an
investigative reporter, are you?

50:21.235 --> 50:22.367
Are you?

50:23.672 --> 50:25.457
I read a profile
on one of the British applicants

50:25.631 --> 50:26.980
who revealed everything

50:27.154 --> 50:28.721
to a reporter
feigning friendship.

50:28.895 --> 50:30.592
Daisy, you get it.

50:30.766 --> 50:32.377
Yeah. I mean, it's all right.

50:33.030 --> 50:33.769
I'm not a reporter.

50:33.943 --> 50:34.814
That's great.

50:35.293 --> 50:36.468
Although crossed arms are

50:36.642 --> 50:38.470
-a sign of defense.
-I mean, really,

50:38.644 --> 50:40.689
Elizabeth,
who wouldn't be defensive
under this interrogation?

50:40.863 --> 50:42.648
I am just looking out
for my brother.

50:42.822 --> 50:44.345
-No, you're looking out
for yourself.
-Okay,

50:44.519 --> 50:45.303
-Alexander, Elizabeth.
-Oh, my God, come on.

50:45.477 --> 50:46.608
Hey, stop.

50:48.436 --> 50:50.351
-Okay.
-Mm.

50:51.352 --> 50:53.963
-I'm sorry.
-I heard about their names,
Mrs. McAllister.

50:54.138 --> 50:55.748
-They really suit them.
-Oh, God.

50:55.922 --> 50:56.923
No, we don't.

50:57.619 --> 50:59.926
Well, I mean, you run a PR firm.

51:00.100 --> 51:02.233
Alex is about to conquer space.
It fits.

51:02.407 --> 51:03.625
I certainly hope so.

51:03.799 --> 51:06.454
I spent my pregnancies
buried in books.

51:06.628 --> 51:09.544
Well, what she means to say is
you were looking like a Genghis
there for a minute.

51:12.025 --> 51:15.159
And then what about Tom?
Was he like a big inventor?

51:18.858 --> 51:19.815
Mm.

51:21.643 --> 51:22.601
Sorry.

51:25.473 --> 51:27.258
I shouldn't have.

51:31.218 --> 51:34.047
Daisy, what did you think
about the green beans tonight?

51:35.527 --> 51:37.094
-They were very good.
-Weren't they?

51:37.268 --> 51:39.226
Dimitri brought that recipe
over from Russia.

51:39.400 --> 51:42.882
Mom, we put paprika on them.
It's hardly revolutionary.

51:43.056 --> 51:44.753
Well, maybe it is.

52:19.048 --> 52:20.746
We can finish another row today.

52:22.356 --> 52:23.488
Get ahead on orders.

52:24.837 --> 52:26.317
Good to see you
enjoying the farm.

52:27.100 --> 52:28.971
Yeah, it's nice.

52:30.364 --> 52:31.235
You know,

52:32.714 --> 52:34.368
I can't run
this place much longer.

52:35.195 --> 52:37.632
I wanna leave it
in good hands though.

52:37.806 --> 52:40.679
I, I was thinking
I'd sign it over to you.

52:42.028 --> 52:43.421
It won't be easy, you know.

52:43.595 --> 52:45.553
Harder with this weather, but...

52:46.598 --> 52:48.513
...worth it, I think, to...

52:49.949 --> 52:53.561
...you know, work the earth
and be part of it all.

52:56.390 --> 52:57.913
I'm going to Mars.

52:58.827 --> 52:59.915
Realistically though.

53:00.525 --> 53:01.787
I am being realistic.

53:04.137 --> 53:07.488
Well, you know, I just thought
I would give you a purpose.

53:07.662 --> 53:09.229
I have a purpose.

53:10.491 --> 53:12.537
I'm not Tom, Dad.

53:15.061 --> 53:16.628
So you won't even consider it?

53:16.802 --> 53:19.544
Well, no,
it just doesn't make any sense.

53:20.980 --> 53:23.461
It would be a waste
of both of our times
when I'm leaving so soon.

53:23.635 --> 53:26.681
-You're not actually
going, Alex.
-I am going.

53:26.855 --> 53:29.162
-But I'm giving this to you.
-I don't want it.

53:35.734 --> 53:37.214
I'm gonna take a break.

53:52.490 --> 53:53.839
Alex McAllister.

53:55.667 --> 53:57.190
Mark Johnston
with The Wickford Times.

53:57.364 --> 53:58.887
I have a few questions
about Mission Mars.

53:59.061 --> 54:00.498
Elizabeth McAllister handles
all PR requests.

54:00.672 --> 54:01.890
Just wanna get your take on

54:02.064 --> 54:02.891
new reports
the mission's a scam.

54:03.065 --> 54:04.502
It is not a scam, okay?

54:04.676 --> 54:06.199
-It's real.
-Look, Alex,

54:06.373 --> 54:08.114
I just wanna hear your side
of the story, all right?

54:08.593 --> 54:10.116
Can we set the record straight?

54:24.130 --> 54:25.827
He ever tell you
how he was selected?

54:26.567 --> 54:28.439
-Mm-mm.
-Skype interviews.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.832
Does that sound legit to you?

54:32.225 --> 54:35.272
Look, I don't want you spending
too much time on this policy.

54:35.968 --> 54:37.709
All right, there's lots
of other policies out there

54:37.883 --> 54:40.973
way more normal
than this particular one.

54:42.540 --> 54:44.629
Why do I have a feeling we're
not talking about policies?

54:45.978 --> 54:47.153
Look, he's always been
a nice boy.

54:47.327 --> 54:48.720
He's just never been normal.

54:48.894 --> 54:50.504
I don't know what you got
going with him, but

54:51.288 --> 54:53.159
I don't think
it's the best idea.

54:53.899 --> 54:54.813
Noted.

55:04.605 --> 55:07.086
-I thought she had...
-Good morning, gentlemen.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.001
-Hey.
-How you doing?

55:09.175 --> 55:10.524
Your boy made the paper, Jeff.

55:12.657 --> 55:14.093
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

55:16.661 --> 55:20.099
-It's nice to see him smiling.
-He's our favorite Martian.

55:22.231 --> 55:23.450
Keep it.

55:26.888 --> 55:28.586
He didn't seem so happy.

55:39.814 --> 55:40.641
Sorry, Jeff.

55:41.468 --> 55:42.643
I tried to throw them out,

55:42.817 --> 55:44.732
but Bert found them
in the dumpster.

55:44.906 --> 55:45.994
Not your fault.

56:03.751 --> 56:06.450
You're making a goddamn fool
out of yourself.

56:06.624 --> 56:08.277
-Out of all of us.
-What--

56:08.843 --> 56:10.410
Alex, you spoke to reporters?

56:10.976 --> 56:12.934
You promised
you'd refer them to me.

56:13.108 --> 56:14.762
I-- He said it was a scam.
I had to say--

56:14.936 --> 56:16.634
You couldn't even
change his mind.

56:17.199 --> 56:18.766
-It's on the Internet.
-He na--, he named the farm.

56:18.940 --> 56:20.551
He named our clients,
our suppliers.

56:20.725 --> 56:22.857
Now, everyone can see
this nonsense.

56:23.031 --> 56:25.120
-Doesn't matter
what anyone else thinks.
-Yes, it does.

56:25.294 --> 56:26.600
We're all a part of this now.

56:27.340 --> 56:28.733
Well, I mean,
they'll see the truth

56:28.907 --> 56:30.561
-when I head off to training.
-Enough!

56:31.649 --> 56:32.780
I said enough.

56:35.827 --> 56:38.003
This has gone on
for far too long,

56:38.177 --> 56:40.005
and I-- I won't tolerate it
anymore.

56:40.614 --> 56:42.442
Your-- your father
is just concerned, sweetie,

56:42.616 --> 56:43.835
-'cause you're doing something
so different.
-Mom,

56:44.009 --> 56:45.880
Dad is right.
This needs to stop.

56:46.054 --> 56:48.056
-It's his life.
-But it's not real.

56:48.230 --> 56:50.581
I offered him a real life,

56:50.755 --> 56:53.192
and, and he, he, he,
he chose this farce.

56:53.366 --> 56:55.977
-Because he's giving up!
-So you're a therapist now.

56:57.457 --> 56:59.677
Why are you even here?
Why, why--

56:59.851 --> 57:03.202
-Why do you even care?
-You're committing suicide,
you asshole.

57:03.376 --> 57:06.684
And I don't care
if you've got a mask
in this space explorer bullshit.

57:06.858 --> 57:07.902
I know what you're doing.

57:08.947 --> 57:11.340
You don't wanna keep going
without Tom.

57:11.515 --> 57:13.952
-Don't bring him into this.
-He is this!

57:14.126 --> 57:15.344
This is bullshit!

57:16.868 --> 57:19.392
Oh, sweetie,

57:19.566 --> 57:21.220
I, I didn't realize.

57:22.134 --> 57:25.659
Oh, I never should have
en-- encouraged. Oh.

57:25.833 --> 57:29.141
-No, you--
-I just wanted you to be safe.

57:29.315 --> 57:31.230
I never thought
you'd actually leave.

57:31.404 --> 57:34.102
-Mom--
-I just can't stand not
knowing where you both are.

57:34.276 --> 57:35.843
I, I just, I can't stand it.

57:54.035 --> 57:57.299
There will be no mention of Mars
or missions or training

57:57.474 --> 57:59.737
under this roof again.

58:00.868 --> 58:02.043
We're done.

58:46.174 --> 58:47.349
You wanna go somewhere?

58:48.220 --> 58:51.353
-Like right now?
-Yeah. There's this place
that I wanna take you.

58:51.528 --> 58:53.617
But you're not-- We're gonna
have to use your car.

58:54.139 --> 58:55.967
You're gonna have to drive
as well.

58:57.621 --> 58:59.274
What an offer. You can't drive?

58:59.448 --> 59:00.754
I don't drive.

59:03.148 --> 59:04.410
Okay.

59:37.095 --> 59:38.357
Where are we going?

59:39.619 --> 59:40.881
You'll see.

59:51.065 --> 59:52.197
Whoa!

59:58.769 --> 1:00:00.771
I know you miss swimming, so...

1:00:07.299 --> 1:00:09.257
Don't get me wrong.
I also hate swimming.

1:00:09.431 --> 1:00:10.781
I know.

1:00:10.955 --> 1:00:12.957
-You've ruined my life.
-Temporarily.

1:00:17.091 --> 1:00:18.005
What, what are you doing?

1:00:18.179 --> 1:00:19.354
Going in!

1:00:19.528 --> 1:00:21.443
-It's cold!
-Come on!

1:00:22.488 --> 1:00:24.359
What do you think Mars is like?

1:00:24.533 --> 1:00:26.361
Well, okay, that's different,
all right?

1:00:26.535 --> 1:00:27.841
We'll have protection.

1:00:28.015 --> 1:00:29.843
All I hear is fear!

1:00:30.409 --> 1:00:31.671
Whoo!

1:00:33.238 --> 1:00:34.456
Come on!

1:00:35.196 --> 1:00:37.808
Oy, come on, come on, come on!

1:00:37.982 --> 1:00:39.505
Whoo!

1:00:40.506 --> 1:00:41.855
Ah.

1:00:44.510 --> 1:00:45.772
Come on.

1:00:48.688 --> 1:00:49.558
Whoa.

1:00:50.298 --> 1:00:52.213
Come on, Alexander the Great.

1:00:55.129 --> 1:00:57.392
I used to love doing this
as a kid.

1:00:58.176 --> 1:01:01.179
Just close your eyes
and let the waves take you.

1:01:04.791 --> 1:01:06.097
Yeah.

1:01:14.235 --> 1:01:16.020
No, it's not good.

1:01:31.035 --> 1:01:32.253
Whoo!

1:02:08.681 --> 1:02:10.465
You've really never
met Curtis before.

1:02:11.336 --> 1:02:13.164
No, uh, he lives
in another state.

1:02:15.906 --> 1:02:17.821
Out the back, round the side.

1:02:23.870 --> 1:02:26.525
Hey, welcome to mi casa.

1:02:26.699 --> 1:02:29.136
Sorry, I didn't know you had
something going on today.
We would have--

1:02:29.310 --> 1:02:30.834
Oh, no, no. This is nothing.
It's nothing.

1:02:31.008 --> 1:02:32.357
Hey.

1:02:32.966 --> 1:02:36.404
It was so great to get
your call, my man. So great.

1:02:36.578 --> 1:02:38.755
Bring it in, come here.
Bring it in.

1:02:40.626 --> 1:02:43.194
-Oh, nice.
-Yeah, right. Um...

1:02:44.412 --> 1:02:46.893
-Uh, this is, this is Daisy.
-Hi.

1:02:47.067 --> 1:02:48.895
What insurance agency
do you work for?

1:02:49.069 --> 1:02:50.114
I thinking of switching.

1:02:50.897 --> 1:02:53.073
-Hi.
-Curtis, you, you have kids?

1:02:53.247 --> 1:02:56.642
Yeah, I do. Uh, one, two,

1:02:56.816 --> 1:02:59.950
uh, third one
around here somewhere.

1:03:00.515 --> 1:03:02.082
Hi, I'm Tiff.

1:03:02.256 --> 1:03:03.997
-Hi.
-Sorry for the chaos.

1:03:04.171 --> 1:03:07.566
-Alex.
-Uh, you're a colonist.

1:03:08.219 --> 1:03:10.743
-Yeah.
-I thought it was just a phase.

1:03:10.917 --> 1:03:13.659
-Mommy! Stop.
-I better go get them.

1:03:15.487 --> 1:03:18.185
This thing about Mars
is a no-kids policy. Am I right?

1:03:18.359 --> 1:03:20.405
Come on.

1:03:20.579 --> 1:03:22.537
Um...
Come on. Let me take you
to Mission Control.

1:03:24.452 --> 1:03:26.019
Where the magic happens.

1:03:35.246 --> 1:03:37.030
-Come on.
-Your wife is lovely.

1:03:37.204 --> 1:03:38.684
Yeah, yeah. Tiff's great.

1:03:39.293 --> 1:03:41.034
Sit, sit, sit, sit. Oh.

1:03:43.558 --> 1:03:44.429
Sit.

1:03:46.648 --> 1:03:48.999
It is good
to meet you properly, my man.

1:03:49.173 --> 1:03:50.696
Likewise.

1:03:50.870 --> 1:03:53.525
Do you realize that
I am one of the only people

1:03:53.699 --> 1:03:56.223
you're gonna see in person
for the rest of your life?

1:03:56.397 --> 1:03:59.270
-Crazy.
-Wild.

1:03:59.444 --> 1:04:01.228
-Sick of waiting, dude.
-Right.

1:04:01.402 --> 1:04:03.274
-When is training gonna start?
-I don't know.

1:04:03.448 --> 1:04:05.145
-I'm good to go, bro.
-Right.

1:04:05.319 --> 1:04:07.234
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:04:07.408 --> 1:04:09.715
And your family's cool
with you leaving Earth?

1:04:10.411 --> 1:04:12.239
Yeah. Tiff's fine with it.

1:04:12.413 --> 1:04:13.545
Really?

1:04:13.719 --> 1:04:14.807
Yeah, of course.

1:04:16.026 --> 1:04:17.636
I mean, it's bad if the other
person doesn't want you

1:04:17.810 --> 1:04:19.246
to follow your dreams.
Am I right?

1:04:20.465 --> 1:04:21.814
I am right.

1:04:23.555 --> 1:04:25.122
Yeah, but they're gonna
miss you terribly.

1:04:25.296 --> 1:04:27.211
What can you do? Space calls.

1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:30.214
Daddy, he hit me.

1:04:30.388 --> 1:04:31.606
I think, um...

1:04:33.521 --> 1:04:35.088
Daddy, what are you
doing in there?

1:04:35.262 --> 1:04:36.655
Honey, help me out here
with the kids.

1:04:41.442 --> 1:04:43.009
Going to space.

1:05:00.766 --> 1:05:02.159
I cheated at swimming.

1:05:04.813 --> 1:05:06.815
-What?
-That's why I moved here.

1:05:07.947 --> 1:05:09.731
I wasn't good enough.

1:05:09.906 --> 1:05:12.560
I was one second
short of placing.

1:05:12.734 --> 1:05:14.258
One second.

1:05:15.259 --> 1:05:18.349
And I was under
a lot of pressure,

1:05:18.523 --> 1:05:22.092
and so I took a supplement,

1:05:22.266 --> 1:05:25.356
and I got found out,
and I got banned.

1:05:25.530 --> 1:05:27.880
And now, it defines me.

1:05:31.362 --> 1:05:32.929
My family's ashamed of me.

1:05:34.626 --> 1:05:35.801
I'm ashamed of me.

1:05:37.803 --> 1:05:39.979
Why are you telling me this now?

1:05:40.632 --> 1:05:43.548
Because I don't wanna have
anything in common
with that guy.

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:48.857
Look, I, I know
Curtis doesn't come off well,

1:05:49.032 --> 1:05:51.251
but he's, um, he's
actually really intelligent.

1:05:51.425 --> 1:05:53.558
-He published this paper
on solar phase--
-He's going to Mars

1:05:53.732 --> 1:05:55.821
to escape his life,
and you know it.

1:05:55.995 --> 1:05:57.910
So that's what
you think I'm doing?

1:05:59.781 --> 1:06:00.913
I'm asking if you are.

1:06:03.785 --> 1:06:05.352
-Where are you going?
-I need a minute.

1:06:05.526 --> 1:06:08.442
-Uh, I'm talking to you.
-So keep talking to me.

1:06:09.356 --> 1:06:11.576
Fine. I looked
into your mission.

1:06:11.750 --> 1:06:13.926
-And?
-And it's a bunch
of ifs and maybes.

1:06:14.100 --> 1:06:16.581
-It's a risk.
-It's giving up.

1:06:16.755 --> 1:06:18.931
You act like the world
is such a bad place--

1:06:19.105 --> 1:06:20.454
It's a shit world.

1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:23.588
Then change it.

1:06:25.459 --> 1:06:28.375
You like me,
and you won't acknowledge it.

1:06:28.549 --> 1:06:31.161
And the crazy thing is,
is that I like you too.

1:06:31.335 --> 1:06:32.945
But we can't do
anything about it

1:06:33.119 --> 1:06:35.382
because it doesn't fit
into your schedule.

1:06:37.471 --> 1:06:38.995
So, what am I supposed to do?

1:06:39.647 --> 1:06:41.040
Quit the mission
so I can date you?

1:06:41.214 --> 1:06:43.608
No. I just want you to consider

1:06:43.782 --> 1:06:45.392
why you're actually doing it.

1:06:45.566 --> 1:06:49.614
If it's to be an explorer
or a scientist, then great.

1:06:49.788 --> 1:06:51.616
-But if not--
-If not what?

1:06:55.141 --> 1:06:57.187
You only get one life, Alex.

1:06:59.406 --> 1:07:01.060
And if you waste it waiting,

1:07:01.234 --> 1:07:03.106
you don't get a second one.

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:08.154
It's ironic to be lectured
by a cheater

1:07:08.328 --> 1:07:09.982
hiding in a country town.

1:07:15.770 --> 1:07:17.859
I'm going to Mars, Daisy.

1:07:20.645 --> 1:07:23.169
And for the record,
I still don't see you
making any great decisions.

1:07:26.303 --> 1:07:27.956
At least I'm trying, asshole.

1:07:42.145 --> 1:07:43.233
Hey!

1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:04.950
Okay. You're going to hit these
until you don't want to anymore.

1:08:06.212 --> 1:08:07.648
This is stupid.

1:08:08.301 --> 1:08:11.130
-Even so.
-Okay.

1:08:11.696 --> 1:08:13.915
You know, my brother used
to play this dumb game.

1:08:16.701 --> 1:08:17.528
Okay.

1:08:19.399 --> 1:08:21.227
Whoa.

1:08:21.401 --> 1:08:23.099
How could he
just disappear like that?

1:08:23.273 --> 1:08:24.970
I think he went to see Daisy.

1:08:28.104 --> 1:08:29.409
Tom.

1:08:36.895 --> 1:08:40.290
How could he leave me
in charge of this insane family?

1:08:41.029 --> 1:08:42.074
Again!

1:08:46.296 --> 1:08:47.427
Again!

1:08:47.601 --> 1:08:49.168
We can stay here all night.

1:08:50.126 --> 1:08:51.475
Whoa.

1:09:07.926 --> 1:09:09.406
He'll come home when he's ready.

1:09:26.423 --> 1:09:27.424
Thanks, Curtis.

1:09:39.958 --> 1:09:42.482
Ah, I asked you to do one thing.
One thing.

1:09:43.135 --> 1:09:44.745
Just let me know
you're all right.

1:09:46.269 --> 1:09:47.357
Okay?

1:09:50.011 --> 1:09:51.187
I don't...

1:09:52.318 --> 1:09:53.493
I don't have to.

1:09:54.886 --> 1:09:56.235
Okay?

1:10:01.022 --> 1:10:02.676
It's not my job...

1:10:03.721 --> 1:10:05.549
...to make you feel better.

1:10:16.647 --> 1:10:18.214
Oh, you, you are right.

1:10:19.737 --> 1:10:22.783
You are absolutely right.

1:10:22.957 --> 1:10:25.003
That is not your job.

1:10:26.613 --> 1:10:28.702
That's ridiculous.

1:10:30.226 --> 1:10:31.618
Oh.

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:35.013
Oh, you do
whatever you want, sweetie.

1:10:40.410 --> 1:10:42.325
Just vanish again.

1:10:42.499 --> 1:10:43.935
Go to another planet.

1:10:45.197 --> 1:10:47.721
Just send me a postcard.

1:10:47.895 --> 1:10:49.723
Ah. Oh, but don't forget
a jacket.

1:10:49.897 --> 1:10:51.682
I hear Mars gets chilly
at night.

1:11:16.010 --> 1:11:18.099
This is Alex McAllister
to Mission Control.

1:11:18.274 --> 1:11:20.145

Did Tom...

1:13:54.647 --> 1:13:55.735
Did he know how--

1:13:56.649 --> 1:13:58.129
Did he know that we loved him?

1:13:59.043 --> 1:14:02.133
-Oh, of course, he did.
-But how much, I mean...

1:14:03.308 --> 1:14:05.092
Did we-- Did I--

1:14:05.963 --> 1:14:08.313
-Did I tell him enough?
-Yes, of course.

1:14:08.487 --> 1:14:10.837
He knew it.

1:14:11.011 --> 1:14:14.275
Sweetie, he knew it.

1:14:15.799 --> 1:14:16.626
Oh.

1:14:19.542 --> 1:14:20.891
It's okay.

1:14:21.935 --> 1:14:23.502
It's okay. It's okay.

1:14:35.122 --> 1:14:36.036
Alex?

1:14:36.689 --> 1:14:37.995
He's not here.

1:14:39.431 --> 1:14:41.085
I can see his feet.

1:14:43.348 --> 1:14:44.392
I'm coming up.

1:14:54.098 --> 1:14:55.578
This used to feel a lot higher.

1:15:01.584 --> 1:15:03.411
Sorry I dragged you
into all this.

1:15:04.804 --> 1:15:05.849
Oh.

1:15:06.458 --> 1:15:09.156
You know, I, I hit
some baseballs recently,

1:15:09.330 --> 1:15:10.593
and I emerged...

1:15:11.724 --> 1:15:13.552
...strangely fine
about everything.

1:15:14.292 --> 1:15:15.685
So I did you a favor.

1:15:16.555 --> 1:15:18.209
Oh, don't get carried away.

1:15:20.516 --> 1:15:23.736
Look, I know I, um,
haven't been around.

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.263
It's, um, just...

1:15:30.221 --> 1:15:32.005
When I look at you,
I think of Tom.

1:15:34.094 --> 1:15:36.270
And then, I imagine you

1:15:37.315 --> 1:15:38.882
dying as well.

1:15:39.447 --> 1:15:41.624
Which, trust me, I know I need

1:15:41.798 --> 1:15:44.235
colossal amounts
of therapy to fix.

1:15:45.497 --> 1:15:47.760
Just imagining it, the pain,

1:15:48.326 --> 1:15:51.198
so unbearable, it's easier
to just stay away and...

1:15:52.504 --> 1:15:54.506
...work every hour of the day.

1:15:55.289 --> 1:15:58.597
I thought there was
something wrong with me
'cause I imagined you dying.

1:15:59.206 --> 1:16:00.294
Really?

1:16:03.950 --> 1:16:06.474
-We're fucked up.
-I think we really are.

1:16:08.955 --> 1:16:10.653
God, I miss him so much.

1:16:12.655 --> 1:16:13.699
Me too.

1:16:15.092 --> 1:16:18.661
Even though he was
the, uh, blatant favorite.

1:16:18.835 --> 1:16:21.968
God, farm wonder
and baseball star.

1:16:22.142 --> 1:16:23.927
With rugged good looks,

1:16:24.101 --> 1:16:26.843
and none
of our debilitating anxiety.

1:16:27.017 --> 1:16:28.322
None.

1:16:28.888 --> 1:16:31.630
He always gestured too much
when he was telling stories.

1:16:31.804 --> 1:16:32.892
What was that about?

1:16:33.066 --> 1:16:35.765
This one.

1:16:39.333 --> 1:16:41.118
Hmm.

1:16:42.206 --> 1:16:43.424
You see Mars from here?

1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:48.516
Um, no, it's behind the sun
for the next few months.

1:16:49.126 --> 1:16:51.171
-Hm.
-You can see Venus though.

1:16:54.392 --> 1:16:56.307
You're willing to live
in such a big universe.

1:16:57.177 --> 1:16:59.005
I prefer thinking it's only us.

1:17:00.050 --> 1:17:01.747
-Never been only us.
-Mm.

1:17:04.750 --> 1:17:06.143
Do you think he's up there?

1:17:08.449 --> 1:17:09.625
No.

1:17:10.538 --> 1:17:11.714
He's in the ground.

1:17:18.851 --> 1:17:21.158
-Remember this?
-Oh, what?

1:17:29.732 --> 1:17:31.385
I thought we lost it.

1:17:39.785 --> 1:17:41.918
Oh, the queen.

1:17:44.050 --> 1:17:45.225
And...

1:17:50.578 --> 1:17:51.667
...and the conqueror.

1:18:33.839 --> 1:18:35.101
You're up early.

1:18:36.233 --> 1:18:37.408
I couldn't sleep.

1:18:46.112 --> 1:18:49.420
You know, um,
my vacation time ran out.

1:18:52.553 --> 1:18:54.904
But I can't go back.

1:18:56.035 --> 1:18:57.558
Now that I'm here, I can't,

1:18:57.733 --> 1:19:00.387
uh, I can't go back
and pretend that I care.

1:19:03.608 --> 1:19:06.654
These stupid flowers,

1:19:06.829 --> 1:19:09.440
these, apparently, I care about.

1:19:13.618 --> 1:19:16.882
What's the common name
for Lathyrus Odoratus?

1:19:17.578 --> 1:19:19.972
-Sweet pea.
-And what's the most
valuable peony?

1:19:20.146 --> 1:19:21.931
-Sonoma Halo.
-Wrong.

1:19:22.105 --> 1:19:23.497
Pastelegance.

1:19:23.671 --> 1:19:26.109
Actually, Sonoma Halo
took over last year.

1:19:27.023 --> 1:19:30.026
It also happens to be a more
drought-resistant variety.

1:19:31.984 --> 1:19:33.986
I know what I'm doing, okay?

1:19:36.641 --> 1:19:37.773
Okay.

1:20:05.104 --> 1:20:06.845
Is the rocket ready?

1:20:07.019 --> 1:20:09.326
Permission to board
the spacecraft.

1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:11.067
Proceed via the airlock chamber.

1:20:12.285 --> 1:20:13.286
Okay.

1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:18.509
Oh, Wow.

1:20:18.683 --> 1:20:20.380
Delivery from Earth.

1:20:20.554 --> 1:20:22.208
These were
my brother's and mine.

1:20:22.382 --> 1:20:25.037
But I thought you guys would get
some more use out of them.

1:20:26.822 --> 1:20:29.172
Your brother who died?

1:20:30.303 --> 1:20:33.306
Yeah. Yeah.
Um, you remember him?

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:35.439
Uh-huh. He was nice.

1:20:39.051 --> 1:20:40.357
We wanted to work at NASA.

1:20:41.749 --> 1:20:44.317
-It's where I wanna work.
-Yeah.

1:20:45.318 --> 1:20:46.406
Whoa, Blake.

1:20:50.323 --> 1:20:52.412
-This is so cool.
-So awesome.

1:20:52.586 --> 1:20:54.110
Definitely us.

1:20:54.632 --> 1:20:56.373
You are go for launch.

1:20:56.547 --> 1:20:58.766
T-minus 15 seconds to begin.

1:21:00.246 --> 1:21:02.640
And go for auto sequence start.

1:21:02.814 --> 1:21:05.208
-The SRV hydraulic...
-T minus ten,

1:21:05.382 --> 1:21:06.818
nine, eight,

1:21:06.992 --> 1:21:10.300
-seven, six...
-Seven, six, five...

1:21:10.474 --> 1:21:13.869
-Engines start, four...
-Four, three,

1:21:14.043 --> 1:21:15.783
two, one,

1:21:15.958 --> 1:21:17.002
blast off!

1:21:21.441 --> 1:21:23.791
And liftoff.

1:21:25.445 --> 1:21:26.359
Yeah.

1:21:29.841 --> 1:21:31.451
We did it, son.

1:21:44.334 --> 1:21:47.076
Hey, Mom, do you know
where my suit is? The grey one?

1:21:47.250 --> 1:21:49.687
-Uh, yes, in the hall closet.
-Great.

1:21:52.255 --> 1:21:55.171
I'm going to the dry cleaners
if anyone wants me
to take anything?

1:21:57.347 --> 1:21:58.391
What's the occasion?

1:21:59.784 --> 1:22:02.961
Um, I'm getting my suit
dry-cleaned.

1:22:03.919 --> 1:22:05.746
Thank you. I meant why.

1:22:05.921 --> 1:22:08.314
Oh, I got a job interview.

1:22:10.490 --> 1:22:11.578
Where?

1:22:12.275 --> 1:22:14.668
It's called the Rhode Island
Space Consortium.

1:22:14.842 --> 1:22:16.670
They've got
some impressive resources.

1:22:16.844 --> 1:22:20.718
I was surprised they expressed
interest in my project.

1:22:21.632 --> 1:22:24.809
-The Mars Grover?
-Still not calling it that,
but, um...

1:22:26.158 --> 1:22:28.552
...they're run by NASA,
so, you know.

1:22:28.726 --> 1:22:31.381
And the Mission
is okay with that?

1:22:32.077 --> 1:22:36.690
Uh, I was actually just gonna
focus on this right now.

1:22:40.607 --> 1:22:43.567
Well, you go get it, honey.

1:22:44.394 --> 1:22:47.092
-This is wonderful.
-It is.

1:22:47.919 --> 1:22:50.661
It's a great idea.
Much better than mine.

1:22:51.967 --> 1:22:53.794
It's just an interview, yeah.

1:22:53.969 --> 1:22:55.535
-Well, it's still great.
-Hmm.

1:22:55.709 --> 1:22:57.363
It was when Daisy
suggested it too.

1:22:58.190 --> 1:22:59.148
Oh.

1:23:00.279 --> 1:23:01.977
-I don't remember that.
-Oh?

1:23:02.151 --> 1:23:04.414
Remember, she was like,
"They'll give you funding."

1:23:04.588 --> 1:23:07.156
You were like, "No, thanks.
I'm fine in my greenhouse."

1:23:09.506 --> 1:23:10.463
No.

1:23:11.029 --> 1:23:13.031
-You know, I always liked her.
-So did I.

1:23:13.205 --> 1:23:15.425
-Me too.
-I like anyone
who likes the Mars Grover.

1:23:15.599 --> 1:23:17.557
I get it. You all like Daisy.

1:23:29.004 --> 1:23:31.354
Alex, Listen, here he is.

1:23:31.919 --> 1:23:33.399
This is the Russian
Frank Sinatra.

1:23:33.573 --> 1:23:35.401
There's a Russian Frank Sinatra?

1:23:35.575 --> 1:23:38.752
Or is Frank Sinatra an American
Vladimir Kastivazhiyanki?

1:23:43.018 --> 1:23:45.629
There was something
in the sky that night.

1:23:46.934 --> 1:23:48.327
Oh, there was something

1:23:48.501 --> 1:23:50.634
in the air like light.

1:23:54.420 --> 1:23:58.511
There's a magical spark,
like breaking car parts.

1:24:00.122 --> 1:24:01.732
It sounds more romantic
in Russian.

1:24:04.952 --> 1:24:05.736
Damn it.

1:24:05.910 --> 1:24:07.216
Well, it's not that bad.

1:24:07.390 --> 1:24:08.695
No, it,
it just sounds like

1:24:08.869 --> 1:24:11.002
they're singing about fireflies.

1:24:11.611 --> 1:24:14.223
No, it doesn't. We don't
even have them in Russia.

1:24:18.792 --> 1:24:21.230
-Liz?
-What?

1:24:21.404 --> 1:24:23.623
-You know where Daisy works?
-Yeah.

1:24:23.797 --> 1:24:26.844
Okay. I need you
to try and get her here.

1:24:28.106 --> 1:24:29.673
Um, what changed your mind?

1:24:29.847 --> 1:24:32.067
Oh, Elizabeth,
I would sing it for you,

1:24:32.241 --> 1:24:34.678
but then you will fall in love
with me even more.

1:24:34.852 --> 1:24:37.246
Okay, calm down, Romeo.
Why can't you go?

1:24:37.420 --> 1:24:39.509
I, I gotta do something first.

1:24:40.162 --> 1:24:41.337
Well, what am I supposed
to say to her?

1:24:41.511 --> 1:24:43.339
I don't know. PR something.

1:24:43.513 --> 1:24:45.906
-That's not how that works.
-Liz.

1:24:46.081 --> 1:24:47.734
I'll go. I'll go.

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:04.447
You get one minute.

1:25:04.621 --> 1:25:07.189
Not much of a lunch break
these days.

1:25:08.755 --> 1:25:10.061
I'm sorry.

1:25:11.889 --> 1:25:15.501
You trusted me,
and I used that against you.

1:25:16.633 --> 1:25:19.462
What I said was indefensible.
I, I don't have any excuses.

1:25:19.636 --> 1:25:22.204
It's-- I'm just really sorry.

1:25:26.164 --> 1:25:27.122
Okay.

1:25:29.689 --> 1:25:31.169
Why are we standing in dirt?

1:25:31.996 --> 1:25:33.432
Um, it's a...

1:25:34.607 --> 1:25:35.826
...field of daisies.

1:25:38.133 --> 1:25:39.786
We only had the seeds.

1:25:40.570 --> 1:25:41.962
And not a whole field free.

1:25:42.137 --> 1:25:44.878
It's a row of daisies.

1:25:45.052 --> 1:25:46.402
It was a, it was a lot of work.

1:25:47.707 --> 1:25:49.013
It's very nice.

1:25:49.796 --> 1:25:51.537
It could have waited
until after work though.

1:25:51.711 --> 1:25:53.670
You're right, and I was wrong.

1:25:55.628 --> 1:25:56.977
Never mind, I like this.

1:25:58.414 --> 1:26:02.592
For me, space is safe
as I can control it.

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:06.117
Even though
it's completely unpredictable

1:26:06.291 --> 1:26:07.771
and ever-expanding into a degree

1:26:07.945 --> 1:26:09.990
where it could all
implode at once.

1:26:10.165 --> 1:26:11.514
But that is not the point.
That, that--

1:26:11.688 --> 1:26:13.820
This is, this--
The point is this.

1:26:16.083 --> 1:26:17.824
And this is terrifying.

1:26:19.609 --> 1:26:20.871
I'm terrified.

1:26:21.959 --> 1:26:23.743
You are terrifying.

1:26:25.397 --> 1:26:27.094
Glad I brought so much
to the table.

1:26:29.532 --> 1:26:30.968
My brother died.

1:26:33.275 --> 1:26:35.581
-I know.
-But I never told you...

1:26:37.931 --> 1:26:39.585
We were driving,

1:26:39.759 --> 1:26:42.327
and there was a deer
in the road, and we swerved.

1:26:43.807 --> 1:26:45.200
I, I swerved.

1:26:49.116 --> 1:26:50.901
He was really great, Daisy.

1:26:52.511 --> 1:26:54.339
He had my Mom's eyes.

1:26:55.688 --> 1:26:57.081
And, um...

1:26:58.691 --> 1:26:59.953
He was funny.

1:27:00.127 --> 1:27:02.782
And the last thing he did was

1:27:03.348 --> 1:27:05.220
he put his arm out
to protect me.

1:27:06.830 --> 1:27:10.790
Even though we all know
that doesn't do anything.

1:27:12.923 --> 1:27:13.837
But since then,

1:27:14.011 --> 1:27:16.579
I have been so scared

1:27:16.753 --> 1:27:18.842
of that happening
to anyone else that I love.

1:27:22.237 --> 1:27:25.805
So, that's how I know that

1:27:25.979 --> 1:27:28.286
this is the real adventure
for me.

1:27:28.460 --> 1:27:30.375
That, that part, that was corny.

1:27:31.855 --> 1:27:34.640
But you understand
what I'm saying?

1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:37.121
I do.

1:27:39.906 --> 1:27:41.299
What you got there?

1:27:41.908 --> 1:27:44.041
Uh, daisies.

1:27:44.215 --> 1:27:45.651
Weeds?

1:27:46.565 --> 1:27:48.001
Couldn't exactly do roses.

1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:52.528
Oh, actually,
I kind of like daisies.

1:27:53.746 --> 1:27:56.662
But just try to keep them away
from the other plants, okay?

1:27:59.926 --> 1:28:00.753
Dad!

1:28:01.928 --> 1:28:04.148
Go away. Go.

1:28:08.848 --> 1:28:09.936
Forever a weed.

1:28:13.897 --> 1:28:15.246
What about Mars though?

1:28:17.161 --> 1:28:18.684
There's no daisies on Mars.

1:28:20.164 --> 1:28:21.165
Oh, my God.

1:28:21.339 --> 1:28:22.732
Wow.

1:28:22.906 --> 1:28:24.777
Wow. Oh, my God.

1:28:24.951 --> 1:28:28.085
Did, did you
rehearse that or something?

1:28:28.259 --> 1:28:31.044
No, I actually came up
with that on the spot.

1:28:31.654 --> 1:28:32.655
I loved it.

1:28:33.351 --> 1:28:34.352
Really?

1:28:34.526 --> 1:28:35.440
Really.

1:28:39.226 --> 1:28:42.665
Yes, yes, yes!

1:28:43.535 --> 1:28:44.971
Yes!

1:28:45.755 --> 1:28:48.714
-Yay!
-Whoo!

1:28:48.888 --> 1:28:51.021
Whoo!

1:28:51.195 --> 1:28:53.328
-Whoo!
-Go, you.

1:28:53.502 --> 1:28:55.373
-Oh, oh, oh!
-Awesome.

1:28:55.547 --> 1:28:57.114
-Go.
-Sorry.

1:28:57.288 --> 1:28:58.811
Yes.

1:29:04.513 --> 1:29:05.905
This is Mars.

1:29:06.950 --> 1:29:09.387
This will be the first colony
on Mars.

1:29:10.301 --> 1:29:13.348
Two hundred and ten days.
people will travel there
in this.

1:29:14.523 --> 1:29:16.089
Then this will be their home.

1:29:17.264 --> 1:29:18.396
But I will be here.

1:29:20.398 --> 1:29:21.921
This is my home.

1:29:22.879 --> 1:29:25.925
This is where I sleep,
where I eat, work,

1:29:26.622 --> 1:29:28.014
-play...
-This is just...

1:29:30.669 --> 1:29:31.801
...explore...

1:29:33.542 --> 1:29:35.674
...get sick, you get better...

1:29:35.848 --> 1:29:37.937
...pioneer...

1:29:40.592 --> 1:29:41.898
...grow old...

1:29:45.554 --> 1:29:46.642
...and live.

1:30:07.184 --> 1:30:09.360
