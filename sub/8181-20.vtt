WEBVTT

00:04.737 --> 00:06.337
DOUG, I'M GONNA MISS MY TRAIN.
WHAT TIME IS IT?

00:06.405 --> 00:07.371
WOULD YOU RELAX?

00:07.439 --> 00:09.274
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.

00:09.341 --> 00:11.842
OKAY, THAT CLOCK
ONLY HAS ONE HAND.

00:13.646 --> 00:14.879
OH, YEAH.

00:14.947 --> 00:18.116
ALL RIGHT, WHAT TIME IS IT
ON THE COFFEE MAKER?

00:18.184 --> 00:20.919
OH, WELL, THE COFFEE MAKER
IS MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME,

00:20.986 --> 00:24.155
PLUS, IT'S
5 MINUTES FAST,

00:24.223 --> 00:27.458
SO THAT WOULD
MAKE IT, UH...

00:27.526 --> 00:28.960
I CAN'T DO THIS.

00:29.028 --> 00:31.496
ALL RIGHT, THE MICROWAVE
SAYS IT'S 7:10. THAT'S GOOD.

00:31.597 --> 00:32.563
7:09,

00:32.631 --> 00:34.099
7:08.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.533
OH, THAT'S MY EGG POCKET.

00:35.534 --> 00:38.170
I CAN'T BE LATE FOR WORK.
WHAT DOES YOUR WATCH SAY?

00:38.237 --> 00:40.505
IT'S NOT A WATCH.
IT JUST COUNTS MY STEPS.

00:40.573 --> 00:41.839
HOLY CRAP, I'M AT 32.

00:41.907 --> 00:44.308
I GOTTA SLOW IT DOWN.

00:44.343 --> 00:46.878
THANK YOU.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.165
SO, JULIE COMES IN
EVERY MORNING AT 10:00,

01:24.283 --> 01:27.618
AND LEAVES AT 4:00, AND LEAVES
ME WITH ALL HER FRIGGIN' WORK.

01:27.686 --> 01:30.054
I SHOULD REPORT
HER, RIGHT?

01:30.122 --> 01:31.956
CAN I OFFER A LITTLE
ADVICE ABOUT THIS?

01:32.024 --> 01:34.092
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO BE A RAT, BUT...

01:34.160 --> 01:35.393
SHE IS ANNOYING.

01:35.461 --> 01:38.230
AND ON TOP OF THAT, SHE
HAS THE WORST HAIR, SO...

01:38.297 --> 01:39.313
MAY I, DARLING-

01:39.381 --> 01:40.815
DAD-DAD,
PLEASE. OKAY?

01:40.883 --> 01:43.368
ALL RIGHT, HONEY, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.636
I'LL JUST FIGURE IT OUT.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.304
OKAY, BYE-BYE.

01:47.773 --> 01:50.908
OKAY, I THINK I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THIS JULIE THING.

01:50.976 --> 01:52.494
IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME,
FINISH YOUR DINNER,

01:52.561 --> 01:54.662
'CAUSE I HAVE TO MEET
DOUG AT THE MOVIES.

01:54.730 --> 01:57.465
I DEALT WITH THIS TYPE OF CHARACTER
WHEN I WAS A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT

01:57.532 --> 02:00.434
<i>ON A LITTLE SHOW
CALLED SESAME STREET.</i>

02:00.502 --> 02:03.037
<i>YOU WORKED ON
SESAME STREET?</i>

02:03.105 --> 02:06.641
SURE. FROM MARCH OF '76
TO MID-MARCH OF '76.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.410
ANYWAY, I CAN'T NAME NAMES,

02:08.561 --> 02:11.563
BUT I HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION

02:11.631 --> 02:15.867
WITH A LARGE BIRD
WITH AN EVEN BIGGER EGO.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.318
BIG BIRD?

02:17.386 --> 02:19.788
YOU SAID IT.
I DIDN'T.

02:19.855 --> 02:22.123
ALL RIGHT, IS THERE
A POINT TO THIS, DAD?

02:22.190 --> 02:24.525
I'VE HAD CLOSE TO
200 JOBS IN MY LIFE,

02:24.594 --> 02:26.728
SO I KNOW A THING OR TWO

02:26.796 --> 02:28.296
ABOUT OFFICE POLITICS.

02:28.363 --> 02:31.967
NOW, DO YOU HAVE
ACCESS TO FIREARMS?

02:32.034 --> 02:33.184
OKAY.

02:33.252 --> 02:35.219
I'M NOT GONNA SHOOT HER.

02:35.287 --> 02:37.471
I NEVER SAID "SHOOT." JUST
LET HER KNOW YOU MEAN BUSINESS.

02:37.539 --> 02:39.090
COME ON.
EAT YOUR BEETS NOW.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.592
I WILL NOT
EAT MY BEETS!

02:40.660 --> 02:43.261
WHY IS IT, DAY AFTER DAY,
I OFFER YOU SOUND ADVICE

02:43.328 --> 02:44.996
ON HOW TO FIX
YOUR PATHETIC LIFE,

02:45.064 --> 02:46.565
AND YOU REJECT IT
EVERY TIME?

02:46.632 --> 02:48.466
WELL, I'VE HAD IT
WITH YOU!

02:51.604 --> 02:54.205
ACTUALLY, I STORMED OFF
FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT.

02:54.273 --> 02:56.007
I'M REALLY
QUITE HUNGRY.

02:58.827 --> 03:00.879
<i>PERFECT. BLOOD THIEVES 2
STARTS IN 10 MINUTES.</i>

03:00.947 --> 03:02.580
I DON'T WANT
TO SEE A MOVIE

03:02.648 --> 03:04.815
WHERE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
GET THEIR BLOOD STOLEN.

03:04.884 --> 03:08.086
OKAY. WHEN IT HAPPENS TO YOU,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW WHAT TO DO.

03:08.170 --> 03:10.488
<i>HONEY, IT'S DATE NIGHT.
I WANT TO SEE BON VIVANT.</i>

03:10.590 --> 03:12.356
OKAY, UNLESS THAT'S
FOREIGN FOR "STEALING BLOOD,"

03:12.424 --> 03:14.258
EH-EH.

03:14.393 --> 03:15.877
HEY, GUYS.

03:15.928 --> 03:17.762
OH, GOOD. PUT DOUG
OUT OF HIS MISERY.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.131
HE WANTS TO SEE
BLOOD THIEVES 2.

03:20.182 --> 03:21.883
OH, I LOVED
THE FIRST ONE.

03:21.934 --> 03:23.602
YEAH. IN THIS ONE,
THERE'S EVEN LESS TALKING.

03:23.686 --> 03:24.636
I'M IN.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.504
<i>ACTUALLY, I WANT
TO SEE BON VIVANT.</i>

03:26.606 --> 03:29.307
THANK YOU. FINALLY,
SOMEBODY WITH SOME TASTE.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.510
YOU MEAN, SOMEBODY
WITH SOME GAY.

03:32.578 --> 03:35.263
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

03:35.331 --> 03:37.315
HEY, I HAVE
AN IDEA.

03:37.382 --> 03:40.818
<i>WHY DON'T ME AND DEACON SEE BON
VIVANT AND YOU GUYS SEE YOUR THING?</i>

03:40.886 --> 03:41.852
THAT'S GREAT.

03:41.921 --> 03:42.954
LET'S DO IT.

03:43.022 --> 03:44.188
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.323
COME ON, GIRL.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.992
I'M GONNA GET SOME SNACKS.
HOW MANY HOT DOGS YOU WANT?

03:52.481 --> 03:54.766
I'M IN A BIT OF
A TIME CRUNCH HERE,

03:54.834 --> 03:57.435
BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A MAN IN CRISIS.

03:57.469 --> 03:58.937
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

03:59.004 --> 04:00.638
YOU CALLED ME.

04:00.706 --> 04:03.891
YES, TO SHARE MY CONSIDERABLE
KNOWLEDGE AND LIFE EXPERIENCE.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.109
I'M OLDER THAN YOU.

04:05.177 --> 04:08.396
THEN YOU SHOULD BE WISE
ENOUGH TO HEED MY ADVICE.

04:08.463 --> 04:12.099
I ONLY CAME HERE BECAUSE
YOU SAID YOU'D BUY ME A SCONE.

04:12.167 --> 04:14.769
AND I WILL, AFTER WE SORT
OUT YOUR TROUBLED LIFE.

04:14.836 --> 04:17.238
NOW, WHERE DO YOU SEE
YOURSELF IN 10 YEARS?

04:17.305 --> 04:18.356
DEAD.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.690
FAIR ENOUGH.

04:19.757 --> 04:21.492
5 YEARS?

04:21.560 --> 04:24.729
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE
I SEE MYSELF IN 5 MINUTES:

04:24.797 --> 04:26.080
BACK ON THE BUS.

04:28.951 --> 04:32.987
SO, I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME WITH
THAT GUY, STEVE, THE OTHER NIGHT.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.021
UH-HUH.

04:34.089 --> 04:35.556
SO, DO I CALL HIM,

04:35.624 --> 04:38.259
OR DO I HAVE TO WAIT
FOR HIM TO CALL ME?

04:38.327 --> 04:39.393
UM...

04:39.461 --> 04:41.178
I JUST HAD
3 MUSCLE RELAXERS,

04:41.246 --> 04:44.682
SO I'M GONNA GO TO THE
BATHROOM AND LIE DOWN FOR A BIT.

04:46.501 --> 04:47.702
DO NOT CALL THIS FELLOW.

04:47.770 --> 04:49.470
EXCUSE ME?

04:49.538 --> 04:51.172
I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING
YOUR CONVERSATION

04:51.240 --> 04:53.674
BECAUSE I WAS
EAVESDROPPING.

04:53.743 --> 04:54.959
NO OFFENSE,

04:55.027 --> 04:56.728
BUT I'M NOT SURE
I WANT ADVICE

04:56.795 --> 04:59.397
FROM A GUY WHO BOUNCES
A CHECK FOR $1.42.

04:59.448 --> 05:02.132
I HAVE OFF-SHORE ACCOUNTS.
I WAS MOVING MONIES AROUND.

05:02.201 --> 05:03.367
WHATEVER.

05:03.452 --> 05:04.902
NOW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

05:04.970 --> 05:08.105
SHOULD YOU CALL THIS
NE'ER-DO-WELL, STEVE.

05:08.173 --> 05:08.939
HE'S A DENTIST.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.207
I'VE GOT ONE, THANK YOU.

05:10.275 --> 05:12.176
THE POINT IS,
IF YOU CALL HIM

05:12.244 --> 05:13.645
YOU'RE GOING
TO SOUND DESPERATE.

05:13.712 --> 05:15.246
LET HIM COME TO YOU.

05:15.313 --> 05:16.831
TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.399
NOW, CAN I GET
YOU ANYTHING?

05:18.467 --> 05:22.202
A CAPPUCCINO MUFFIN
AND A MOCHA LATTE.

05:22.221 --> 05:24.488
THAT'S $5.85.

05:24.523 --> 05:26.257
WHO SHALL I MAKE THIS OUT TO?

05:31.030 --> 05:33.715
HEY! HOW'D YOU
LIKE THE MOVIE?

05:33.782 --> 05:35.349
OH, IT WAS SO SCARY.

05:35.417 --> 05:39.037
YEAH, AND NEWS FLASH,
WITHOUT BLOOD, YOU'RE NOTHING.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.871
GOOD TO KNOW.

05:40.939 --> 05:43.307
<i>SO HOW WAS YOUR
PRECIOUS BON VIVANT?</i>

05:43.375 --> 05:45.309
GREAT.

05:45.377 --> 05:47.111
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?

05:47.178 --> 05:48.913
I CAN'T
TELL YOU EXACTLY,

05:48.980 --> 05:51.149
BUT IT WAS
VERY WELL DONE.

05:53.586 --> 05:54.953
OH, CHECK IT OUT.

05:55.004 --> 05:56.654
SATURDAY THEY'RE STARTING
THE INTERNATIONAL FILM SERIES.

05:56.722 --> 05:58.790
THE DIRECTOR'S GONNA
BE THERE FOR A Q-AND-A.

05:58.808 --> 06:00.007
OH, I'D BE INTO THAT.

06:00.042 --> 06:01.709
YEAH, ME TOO.
OH, WAIT, I FORGOT.

06:01.776 --> 06:04.778
I'M SUPPOSED TO GET DRUNK
AND PASS OUT THAT NIGHT.

06:04.814 --> 06:07.515
WE CAN'T GO. I PROMISED THE
KIDS WE'D TAKE 'EM GO-KARTING.

06:07.582 --> 06:09.917
KEL, MY LEGS ARE TOO
LONG FOR THOSE THINGS.

06:09.968 --> 06:11.035
I HAVE SHORT LEGS.

06:17.275 --> 06:18.543
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

06:18.610 --> 06:19.644
WHOO!

07:06.491 --> 07:09.227
WE WANT FISH STICKS!
WE WANT FISH STICKS!

07:09.295 --> 07:11.429
WE WANT FISH STICKS!

07:19.871 --> 07:21.773
CRANBERRY MUFFIN.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.309
BE A DEAR,
USE THE TONGS.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.362
HOW MUCH
DO I OWE YOU?

07:28.430 --> 07:30.130
OH, IT'S
ON THE HOUSE.

07:30.198 --> 07:31.498
REALLY?

07:31.567 --> 07:35.436
YEAH. EVERY BOUNCED CHECK
COSTS US $20 IN BANK FEES.

07:35.503 --> 07:37.738
OH, WHY, THANK YOU.

07:37.806 --> 07:40.525
BESIDES, THANKS TO YOUR ADVICE,
I'M GOING OUT WITH STEVE AGAIN.

07:40.592 --> 07:43.027
OH, REALLY? WELL, IT
WAS MY PLEASURE TO HELP.

07:43.094 --> 07:46.864
ACTUALLY, I'D LOVE TO GET
SOME ADVICE ON SOMETHING ELSE.

07:46.931 --> 07:49.767
OH, I'D BE HAPPY TO OBLIGE,
ALTHOUGH I DO THINK BETTER

07:49.834 --> 07:53.571
WITH A COMPLIMENTARY
SACK OF BAGEL CHIPS.

07:53.639 --> 07:57.191
UM, WELL, I RENT THIS
REALLY CHEAP APARTMENT,

07:57.259 --> 07:59.059
BUT THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF BREAK-INS,

07:59.128 --> 08:02.563
SO I WAS THINKING
I SHOULD BUY A CONDO.

08:02.631 --> 08:05.366
NO, NO, NO,

08:05.434 --> 08:06.601
STAY PUT.

08:06.668 --> 08:10.004
THE REAL ESTATE MARKET
IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.

08:10.071 --> 08:12.389
BUT MY NEIGHBORHOOD'S
REALLY DANGEROUS.

08:12.457 --> 08:14.308
AND SO IS
BUYING ON THE BUBBLE.

08:17.546 --> 08:19.814
MY ADVICE? STAY AWAY
FROM THE COLOR PEACH.

08:27.589 --> 08:29.023
HEY.
HEY, HONEY.

08:29.090 --> 08:31.659
LISTEN, KELLY CALLED. YOU
LEFT YOUR JACKET IN HER CAR.

08:31.726 --> 08:33.727
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET IT TOMORROW.

08:33.794 --> 08:35.596
SO, HOW WAS MINI-GOLF?

08:35.664 --> 08:38.599
IT WAS GOOD, BUT I HAD TO
GIVE MAJOR ANOTHER TIME OUT,

08:38.667 --> 08:40.034
AND, UH...

08:40.101 --> 08:44.104
KIRBY'S BEEN ASKING A LOT OF
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LADIES,

08:44.206 --> 08:47.474
SO I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE
TO HAVE "THE TALK" WITH HIM.

08:47.509 --> 08:49.811
OH, BOY.
YEAH.

08:49.845 --> 08:52.379
I WAS HOPING YOU CAN GO
OVER SOME STUFF WITH ME,

08:52.447 --> 08:53.948
'CAUSE, UH...
NEVER BEEN 100% SURE

08:54.016 --> 08:56.684
ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS
GOT GOING ON DOWN THERE.

08:59.037 --> 09:00.137
I KNOW, BABY.

09:03.141 --> 09:05.076
HOW WAS YOGA?

09:05.143 --> 09:06.477
OH, IT WAS GREAT.

09:06.544 --> 09:08.746
DEACON IS SO FLEXIBLE,
HE'S LIKE A RUBBER BAND.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.915
HE REALLY HELPED
ME GET INTO MY HIPS.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.383
I'M GONNA BE SORE TOMORROW,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

09:13.485 --> 09:15.686
BUT IT'S A GOOD SORE, RIGHT? YEAH.

09:15.737 --> 09:17.571
LISTEN, I'M MAKING
RAVIOLI FOR DINNER.

09:17.623 --> 09:18.839
OH. ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:18.907 --> 09:21.909
I HAD CARBS TODAY, SO I'LL
JUST HAVE A SALAD TONIGHT.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.112
REALLY?

09:25.180 --> 09:27.614
YEAH, KELLY THINKS I NEED
TO LOSE A FEW POUNDS,

09:27.682 --> 09:30.817
AND, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S RIGHT.

09:30.886 --> 09:32.420
I GOTTA BE HONEST
WITH YOU, HONEY.

09:32.487 --> 09:34.655
I THINK KELLY HAS
BEEN GREAT FOR YOU.

09:34.673 --> 09:37.842
THANKS. I GOTTA SAY, AS LONG AS
YOU'VE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH DEACON-

09:37.910 --> 09:40.144
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU JUST SEEM...

09:40.212 --> 09:41.946
HAPPY.

09:43.932 --> 09:45.466
I AM. I AM.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.701
I GOTTA SAY THAT WE
HAVEN'T HUNG OUT TOGETHER,

09:47.769 --> 09:49.437
YOU KNOW, JUST
THE TWO OF US.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.205
MAYBE WE SHOULD
MAKE A PLAN TO DO THAT.

09:51.273 --> 09:53.341
DEFINITELY!
HOW ABOUT FRIDAY?

09:53.409 --> 09:54.742
OOH! NO, FRIDAY I CAN'T.

09:54.809 --> 09:56.944
DEACON AND I, WE HAVE
THAT GALLERY THING, SO...

09:57.012 --> 09:58.246
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT THOUGH,

09:58.313 --> 10:00.981
HOW ABOUT WE MEET YOU AND
KELLY FOR DRINKS BEFORE?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.318
I'LL CHECK WITH THE BOSS.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.320
WELL, DINNER'LL BE
READY IN A HALF HOUR.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.322
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA
BANG OUT SOME CRUNCHES.

10:12.394 --> 10:15.013
THE GUY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE
US THE BIG STUFFED ANIMAL.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.148
HE WANTED TO GIVE US
THIS LITTLE TROLL DOLL.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.400
SO WHAT DOES THIS ONE DO?
SHE PICKS UP A BASKETBALL,

10:19.468 --> 10:21.768
AND DRAINS
5 IN A ROW, BAM!

10:21.836 --> 10:24.605
AND WHO WALKS OUT OF THERE
WITH A GIANT PANDA?

10:24.673 --> 10:26.106
WE DID!

10:28.410 --> 10:30.144
GOOD TIMES, GOOD TIMES. OH, MAN.

10:30.211 --> 10:32.680
HEY, TELL 'EM WHAT YOU
ASKED THAT TURKISH DIRECTOR.

10:32.748 --> 10:36.183
OH, NO, NO, NO, THEY
WOULDN'T KNOW. YOU KNOW.

10:36.251 --> 10:37.618
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY WOULDN'T GET IT.

10:37.685 --> 10:39.019
YEAH, EXACTLY.
I KNOW.

10:39.087 --> 10:41.655
WE DIDN'T OFFER YOU GUYS
A DRINK. NAME YOUR POISON.

10:41.723 --> 10:42.756
I'LL TAKE A BEER.

10:42.824 --> 10:45.393
ALL RIGHT, BOTTLE OF SUDS
FOR THE RUBBER BAND MAN.

10:45.461 --> 10:48.245
MERLOT, AND... OH, BOY,
I SHOULD KNOW THIS.

10:48.313 --> 10:50.414
UH...

10:50.482 --> 10:51.716
SEA BREEZE.

10:51.783 --> 10:52.783
JACK AND COKE.

10:52.851 --> 10:54.117
JACK AND COKE!

10:55.970 --> 10:57.871
HEY, DEAC, DID YOU
GET A HAIRCUT?

10:57.939 --> 10:59.073
YEP.

10:59.141 --> 11:00.174
AND THE BEARD'S NEXT.

11:04.579 --> 11:06.497
KEL, THERE'S NO
BEER IN THE FRIDGE.

11:06.564 --> 11:08.649
YEAH, I TOLD YOU
TO GET SOME MORE.

11:08.717 --> 11:09.934
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME.

11:10.001 --> 11:13.104
I HAD TO TAKE THE KIDS TO THE
PARK AND WE WENT BY ARBY'S.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.940
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT THE
KIDS EATING BEFORE DINNER.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.260
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
JUST MAKE THEM WATCH ME EAT?

11:19.328 --> 11:22.446
THEY NEED TO COME HOME
TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK.

11:22.513 --> 11:23.547
THEY'RE AT SCHOOL
ALL DAY.

11:23.615 --> 11:26.117
THEY DESERVE
A LITTLE ROAST BEEF.

11:26.184 --> 11:28.919
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, DOUG,
THEY SHOULDN'T BE EATING-

11:28.987 --> 11:30.721
EXCUSE ME, DEAC.
I GOT IT.

11:30.789 --> 11:32.239
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE!

11:32.307 --> 11:34.491
ONE MINUTE I'M NOT SPENDING
ENOUGH TIME WITH THEM.

11:34.559 --> 11:36.727
NOW IT'S TOO MUCH?
I CAN'T WIN WITH YOU!

11:38.630 --> 11:40.214
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

11:40.282 --> 11:41.515
I'M GOING TO
GET US SOME BEER.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.017
NOW? WE HAVE PEOPLE HERE.

11:43.084 --> 11:44.685
FINE!

11:48.407 --> 11:50.557
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE GOTTA GET GOING.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.393
YEAH, THAT BRIDGE
IS GONNA BE NUTS.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.862
YEAH.

11:54.946 --> 11:57.431
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS HAS
BEEN FUN. THANKS SO MUCH.

11:57.498 --> 11:58.565
LATER.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.607
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON THE BOYS.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.235
SIR...

12:18.303 --> 12:19.619
IF THIS IS
ABOUT THE NEWSPAPER,

12:19.687 --> 12:22.589
I WAS PLANNING TO PAY FOR IT
ONCE THE LINE WENT DOWN.

12:22.657 --> 12:23.957
OH, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

12:24.025 --> 12:25.526
I WAS TALKING
TO MY MANAGER,

12:25.594 --> 12:28.362
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
COULD GIVE ME SOME ADVICE.

12:28.430 --> 12:32.884
OH! ANOTHER LOST SOUL
NEEDS MY COMPASS.

12:32.951 --> 12:34.118
PLEASE, SIT.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.286
THANK YOU.

12:35.353 --> 12:36.988
WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU?

12:37.055 --> 12:40.707
CAREER, FAMILY,
SEXUAL CONFUSION?

12:40.775 --> 12:42.976
UH, I JUST WANT TO KNOW

12:43.044 --> 12:45.696
WHO I SHOULD BET ON IN
TOMORROW'S BASKETBALL GAME.

12:45.763 --> 12:48.565
OOH, A GAMBLER.

12:48.633 --> 12:49.983
YEAH. SO WHO
WOULD YOU BET,

12:50.052 --> 12:51.652
THE NETS OR SPURS?

12:51.719 --> 12:54.455
ARE THEY STILL USING
A RED, WHITE AND BLUE BALL?

12:54.523 --> 12:55.523
NO.

12:55.590 --> 12:57.858
THEN BET THE NETS!

12:57.926 --> 12:58.992
THANKS, MAN.

12:59.061 --> 13:00.827
HEY, IT'S WHAT I DO.

13:04.332 --> 13:06.133
PUT IT ALL ON THE SPURS.

13:06.201 --> 13:08.970
WHOA! I SAID, THE NETS.

13:09.037 --> 13:10.938
I KNOW,
BUT GLORIA TOLD ME

13:11.005 --> 13:12.940
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
I SHOULD DO THE OPPOSITE.

13:13.007 --> 13:14.808
WHAT?

13:14.876 --> 13:17.378
SHE SAYS ANY ADVICE FROM
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE WRONG,

13:17.446 --> 13:18.829
SO IF I DO
THE OPPOSITE,

13:18.897 --> 13:21.982
I WIN AND I GET MY VAN
OUT OF THE IMPOUND.

13:22.050 --> 13:24.535
I SEE.

13:24.603 --> 13:28.205
HEY, ARTHUR, I NEED
SOME MORE ADVICE.

13:29.624 --> 13:31.124
DO YOU NOW?

13:36.314 --> 13:37.398
HEY, HONEY.

13:37.466 --> 13:38.432
HEY.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.933
WHAT ARE
YOU WATCHING?

13:40.001 --> 13:42.936
<i>LEONARD NIMOY.</i>

13:45.440 --> 13:48.309
HEY, SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING
READY TO GO OUT WITH KELLY?

13:48.376 --> 13:51.979
I WON'T BE GOING ANYWHERE
WITH THAT WOMAN.

13:52.046 --> 13:54.248
OH, ARE YOU
STILL FIGHTING?

13:54.316 --> 13:55.082
MM.
I'M SO SORRY.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.101
WHATEVER, MAN.

13:57.168 --> 14:00.538
LISTEN, I FIGURED WE'D JUST HANG OUT
TONIGHT AND GET A PIZZA OR SOMETHING.

14:00.606 --> 14:04.324
UH, ACTUALLY, I CAN'T.
I HAVE PLANS WITH DEACON.

14:04.392 --> 14:05.343
WHAT?

14:05.410 --> 14:07.561
YEAH. REMEMBER, WE DO
OUR MOVIE THING TONIGHT?

14:07.629 --> 14:11.215
IF I'M NOT SPENDING TIME WITH KELLY,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HANGING OUT WITH DEACON.

14:11.282 --> 14:13.000
WELL, THAT'S
NOT FAIR.

14:13.067 --> 14:16.637
I MEAN, WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO SUFFER
JUST BECAUSE YOU AND KELLY ARE FIGHTING?

14:16.705 --> 14:19.090
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY WIFE.

14:19.157 --> 14:21.558
HOW ABOUT I CALL
KELLY FOR YOU?

14:21.626 --> 14:23.910
NO! I'M NOT GOING
CRAWLING BACK TO HER.

14:23.978 --> 14:25.562
BUT-BUT, BABY,
JUST 2 DAYS AGO,

14:25.630 --> 14:28.465
YOU SAID SHE WAS THE BEST
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

14:28.533 --> 14:31.002
NOW YOU'RE JUST WILLING
TO THROW ALL THAT AWAY?

14:31.069 --> 14:32.920
YES! NO! I DON'T KNOW!

14:32.988 --> 14:34.488
MY WHOLE WORLD
IS UPSIDE-DOWN!

14:34.556 --> 14:36.724
OKAY!

14:36.791 --> 14:38.892
LET ME JUST CALL HER
FOR YOU NOW, OKAY?

14:38.960 --> 14:40.695
I'LL SMOOTH
THINGS OVER.

14:40.762 --> 14:42.763
FINE, BUT DON'T TELL
HER I'M HERE, OKAY?

14:42.830 --> 14:44.931
I CAN'T BE HERE.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.800
ACT NATURAL TOO.
OH, BE QUIET.

14:46.868 --> 14:48.902
EXCUSE ME. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.771
HEY, KEL, IT'S ME.

14:50.839 --> 14:54.442
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU AND DOUG ARE GOING
THROUGH A LITTLE ROUGH PATCH HERE.

14:56.244 --> 14:59.246
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
SOMETIMES DOUG SAYS THINGS

14:59.314 --> 15:01.632
HE REALLY DOESN'T MEAN.

15:03.201 --> 15:05.636
THE THING IS, IS HE'S
JUST NOT THAT BRIGHT.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.572
YOU KNOW WHAT
I DO WITH HIM?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.908
I GIVE HIM A PRETZEL
OR A CHOCOLATE PUDDING.

15:10.976 --> 15:13.110
THAT JUST CALMS HIM
RIGHT DOWN. REALLY.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.245
UH-HUH.

15:14.312 --> 15:15.545
OKAY.

15:15.613 --> 15:17.782
BUT, KEL, IF
HE CAN JUST-

15:17.849 --> 15:19.316
OKAY. BYE.

15:20.618 --> 15:21.786
SO?

15:22.988 --> 15:24.121
YOU'RE DEAD TO HER.

15:33.731 --> 15:35.266
I GOT FIRED.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.002
WHAT?
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

15:38.069 --> 15:40.571
ARTHUR SAID THAT I SHOULDN'T
ASK MR. BERMAN FOR A RAISE,

15:40.639 --> 15:42.105
SO I DEMANDED ONE.

15:42.173 --> 15:44.174
I DID THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT HE SAID.

15:44.242 --> 15:46.210
WHY DIDN'T THAT WORK?

15:46.261 --> 15:48.045
BECAUSE I KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING,

15:48.112 --> 15:52.082
AND I GAVE YOU THE
OPPOSITE OF THE OPPOSITE.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.984
WHAT?

15:54.019 --> 15:56.570
YEAH. "LOOSE LIPS" OVER
HERE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

15:56.638 --> 15:59.740
YOU COST ME MY JOB!
I CAN'T PAY MY RENT NOW!

15:59.807 --> 16:01.575
I'M GONNA BE
OUT ON THE STREET!

16:01.660 --> 16:03.477
AND YOU HURT MY FEELINGS,

16:03.545 --> 16:05.279
SO NOW WE'RE EVEN.

16:08.516 --> 16:11.619
MUCH LIKE THE
NEO-REALISTS OF THE '70S,

16:11.686 --> 16:13.687
YOUR USE OF FRUIT
AND OFTEN BREAD

16:13.755 --> 16:15.956
SEEM SIGNIFICANT.

16:16.023 --> 16:17.824
<i>AH, LE FRUIT.</i>

16:17.892 --> 16:19.293
YES. YEAH.

16:19.361 --> 16:21.862
I PLACED A ROTTING APPLE
ON THE WINDOWSILL

16:21.929 --> 16:26.267
TO TRY AND SYMBOLIZE
THE CORRUPTION OF PASCHA'S SOUL.

16:27.269 --> 16:28.318
MM.

16:28.386 --> 16:31.338
WHAT SYMBOLIZES
THAT MY ASS IS ASLEEP?

16:31.406 --> 16:33.106
SHH!
YOU SHUSH!

16:34.359 --> 16:36.893
WAS THE RAIN IN
THE LAST SCENE PLANNED-

16:36.961 --> 16:39.179
WOULD YOU SIT STILL?

16:39.247 --> 16:41.248
THIS IS BRUTAL.
HOW MUCH LONGER IS THIS?

16:41.316 --> 16:43.517
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE AN HOUR. AN HOUR?

16:43.585 --> 16:44.985
WOULD YOU PLEASE
CONTROL HIM?

16:45.052 --> 16:46.086
I AM TRYING.

16:46.204 --> 16:47.538
A LITTLE HELP HERE,
YOU KNOW.

16:47.605 --> 16:49.206
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
I KNOW THAT.

16:49.274 --> 16:52.375
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
THROWING THAT IN MY FACE.

16:54.846 --> 16:57.281
I'M GONNA ASK HIM A
QUESTION ABOUT PEPE LE PEW.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.349
STOP IT!

16:58.416 --> 16:59.716
THAT'S IT.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

16:59.784 --> 17:02.235
NO, PLEASE DON'T GO.
I'LL PUT HIM IN THE CAR.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.288
THIS WHOLE THING IS GETTING
KIND OF WEIRD ANYWAY.

17:04.355 --> 17:07.057
IT'S NOT WEIRD,
IT'S GREAT.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.758
I'M SORRY, CARRIE.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.845
DEACON, PLEASE
DON'T LEAVE!

17:11.912 --> 17:14.314
YOU'RE CAUSING
A SCENE.

17:14.382 --> 17:15.615
I DON'T CARE!

17:15.684 --> 17:18.469
CARRIE, IT'S OVER.

17:26.862 --> 17:27.828
YOU STILL GOT ME.

17:27.895 --> 17:29.430
SHUT UP.

17:29.497 --> 17:31.231
LOOK, I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT IT EITHER,

17:31.299 --> 17:34.000
BUT THIS IS THE HAND
WE'VE BEEN DEALT. YOU KNOW?

17:37.989 --> 17:39.289
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

17:39.357 --> 17:41.826
WHAT DO WE DO?
WE MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

17:43.862 --> 17:46.363
WELL, I GUESS I CAN
MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT

17:46.431 --> 17:48.766
TO DO THE STUFF
THAT YOU WANT TO DO.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.351
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S MY BABY.

17:51.419 --> 17:52.619
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:52.687 --> 17:54.454
MAYBE I'LL MAKE
MORE OF AN EFFORT

17:54.522 --> 17:56.724
TO DO THE STUFF
THAT YOU WANT TO DO.

17:56.791 --> 17:58.425
LET'S START WITH ME.

18:00.294 --> 18:01.562
WHOA!

18:03.365 --> 18:04.598
WHA!

18:12.290 --> 18:13.957
SEE, THIS MOVIE'S
A NICE COMPROMISE.

18:14.025 --> 18:16.026
IT'S FRENCH,
BUT IT'S ABOUT A GUY

18:16.093 --> 18:19.196
WHO CUTS OFF PEOPLE'S FEET
WITH A CHAINSAW.

18:19.263 --> 18:20.464
EXCEPT THEY DON'T
SHOW ANYTHING.

18:20.532 --> 18:23.066
THEY JUST TALK
ABOUT IT IN A CAFE.

18:23.134 --> 18:25.452
WELL, THEY'RE LEAVING IT
UP TO YOUR IMAGINATION.

18:25.519 --> 18:27.821
OKAY, I DIDN'T PAY $10
TO IMAGINE-

18:27.889 --> 18:28.939
SHH!

18:29.007 --> 18:30.974
HEY, DON'T SHUSH HIM. HE'S RIGHT.

18:31.042 --> 18:32.543
THIS MOVIE BLOWS.

18:32.610 --> 18:35.178
<i>I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD
HAVE SEEN ANGEL OF DEATH.</i>

18:35.246 --> 18:39.666
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST STARTING.
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

18:39.768 --> 18:41.535
OKAY.

18:42.821 --> 18:46.123
OKAY.
