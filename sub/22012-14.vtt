00:01.635 --> 00:04.105
ADULT ADAM: Back in
the '80s, my brother
discovered rap music

00:04.172 --> 00:05.706
and he was
immediately obsessed.

00:05.773 --> 00:06.940
But he wasn't the only one.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.110
Even pro sports players
got in on the mix.

00:09.177 --> 00:12.546
And the most famous of all
was the Chicago Bears'
Super Bowl Shuffle.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.582
* I didn't come here
Looking for trouble

00:14.648 --> 00:16.917
* I just came to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle *

00:16.984 --> 00:20.121
Look at this garbage.
You're cocky
and overrated, Bears!

00:20.188 --> 00:22.290
The team and the animal.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.426
You think I can't grab
a trout from a stream? I can!

00:25.493 --> 00:27.928
They're the worst
and so is their
stupid shuffle.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.897
* We're not here
To start no trouble

00:29.963 --> 00:31.332
* I just came to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle *

00:31.399 --> 00:32.433
BOTH:
* Super Bowl Shuffle

00:32.500 --> 00:33.534
ADULT ADAM:
And after the Bears,

00:33.601 --> 00:35.736
a ton of NFL teams
made rap videos.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.306
Including our beloved
Philadelphia Eagles.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.574
* Quick six, Wide receiver

00:40.641 --> 00:41.742
* They thought
the name was a joke

00:41.809 --> 00:43.144
* But I made them
all believers *

00:43.211 --> 00:45.413
See, that's how
an NFL team
is supposed to rap.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.648
The Eagles
have a subtlety the Bears
can only dream about.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.951
And yet,
I still sense opportunity
for improvement.

00:51.018 --> 00:54.021
What it needs is real stars.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.458
* Name's Big Tasty
I bust a move

00:57.525 --> 00:59.927
* Also my skin
is silky and smooth

00:59.993 --> 01:02.496
* I'm Naked Rob
and I make the tackle

01:02.563 --> 01:04.965
* I cover my receiver
like a wall with spackle

01:05.032 --> 01:07.335
* It's creamy Geoff Schwartz
Got hands with no match

01:07.401 --> 01:09.803
* Just throw me the ball
And I'll make the catch

01:09.870 --> 01:12.306
* Watch out world
We're causing a kerfuffle

01:12.373 --> 01:14.542
* We rap our rhymes
And do the JTP Shuffle *

01:14.608 --> 01:17.678
Okay, stop.
What is the deal
with these lyrics?

01:17.745 --> 01:21.149
Who says kerfuffle
and calls out their own
silky smooth skin?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.816
When you got it, flaunt it.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.118
It's true.
It's almost buttery.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.386
It's all very odd.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.855
This is good.
All the best football raps

01:27.921 --> 01:31.292
strike a delicate balance
between simple and awkward.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.127
Roll it!
Cut!

01:33.194 --> 01:35.663
Stop it right now.
Hand me that football.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.132
You might as well be
holding a live grenade.
You know the rule.

01:38.199 --> 01:42.035
My little schmoopie's
are too fragile and squishy
to play contact sports.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.672
We're not even playing,
we're just singing
and shuffling.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.207
This is a gateway ball.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.209
It starts with
a fun little shuffle,

01:48.276 --> 01:51.212
and then you go out
and break your ankle
or shatter a pelvis.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.713
I should be rolling at this.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.683
We have plenty
of safe, fun balls
for you to play with.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.486
The fun-est ball
of all, beach.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.920
You literally ruin everything.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.156
Aw, you just need
to give it a try.
Here, catch.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.758
Okay, try again.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.161
Oh. All right.
See, it doesn't even hurt.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.429
Okay, sports are fun.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.998
* I'm twisted up inside

02:11.064 --> 02:14.835
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:17.104 --> 02:18.506
* I don't know the future

02:18.572 --> 02:22.743
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:22.810 --> 02:25.346
ADULT ADAM:
It was February 28th,
1980-something.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.516
The year
of my mom's Bevolution,
where she tried new things.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.017
Like, cutting my hair
with a vacuum.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.552
Oh, balls.
Do you know
what you're doing?

02:31.619 --> 02:33.020
I feel like you don't know
what you're doing.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.523
That's the beauty
of the Flowbee
haircutting system,

02:35.589 --> 02:37.391
I don't have to know
what I'm doing.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.892
I prefer the old system

02:38.959 --> 02:41.862
where we go to your salon
and Chantal washes my hair,

02:41.929 --> 02:43.364
which feels way too good

02:43.431 --> 02:45.098
and I ask her to do it longer

02:45.165 --> 02:47.468
but then it gets weird
and she stops.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.203
What the hell is this?

02:49.270 --> 02:51.372
I'm experimenting
with my Flowbee.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.742
It only takes two minutes
to go from drab to fab!

02:54.808 --> 02:56.076
Done.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.278
That's it?

02:57.345 --> 03:00.080
Chantal usually hands me
a mirror to look at the back

03:00.147 --> 03:02.583
and brushes the hair
off my neck.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.719
Leaning in ever so close
to inspect her work.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.321
Please go.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.257
Bevy, what's with
all this crap?

03:09.323 --> 03:12.626
A Thighmaster, a Veg-OMatic,
a Salad Shooter,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.662
a Pocket Fisherman?

03:14.728 --> 03:16.464
Our people don't fish, fish.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.899
We buy fish
and then we shmear it.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.302
Shmear
White fish

03:21.369 --> 03:22.836
This isn't about shopping.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.406
Anything gipper?
It's about the Bevolution.

03:25.473 --> 03:28.809
Isn't that about you
finding purpose outside
of our moron kids?

03:28.876 --> 03:31.144
And I found it.
Come with me.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.314
So, this QVC,
it's a TV show.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.682
It's a whole channel.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.284
ADULT ADAM: That's right.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.453
Before QVC dot com
was a world leader
in online retail,

03:39.520 --> 03:43.257
they invented
at-home shopping with their
groundbreaking TV channel.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.994
People can shop from
their home using just
a phone and a credit card.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.629
Who would do
something like that?

03:48.696 --> 03:51.198
Yes, I'm calling
about the exciting
shower radio.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.833
Hang up my phone, Al.

03:52.900 --> 03:57.204
But this amazing product
allows me to listen to music
while I'm wet.

03:57.271 --> 04:02.443
See, Murray, QVC is just
regular people like me
selling big ideas.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.111
We're living in the future.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.948
Now I only bought that stuff
as research to figure out
what I could sell.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.783
You know what?
That's not a bad idea.

04:09.850 --> 04:13.887
Oh, that is so typical.
Why would I ever expect
my own husband's support?

04:13.954 --> 04:17.157
Did you hear what I said?
It's not a bad idea.

04:17.224 --> 04:20.294
How can you
stand there and mock
the love of your life?

04:20.361 --> 04:23.297
She's just trying
to improve herself,
and this is how you act?

04:23.364 --> 04:27.034
Okay, I get it.
You're both not used to
me being supportive.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.303
Shame.
I don't like
this look on you, Mur.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.904
Both of you, listen.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.874
I'm sincerely saying
that I believe you can
do this, Beverly.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.643
You always have great ideas.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.245
You never give up.
You're made for this.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.847
So, there's really no angle?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.715
No angle,
just love and support.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.984
Why can't anyone accept
that I'm capable of this?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.886
I accept it with all my heart.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.521
Thank you for believing in me.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.424
ADULT ADAM:
And just like that,
QVC did the impossible.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.493
Made my dad
a supportive husband.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.496
And Barry was also
doing the impossible.
Going against my Mom.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.765
Cunningham feeds back,
he looks left...

04:57.831 --> 04:59.833
Boom! Refrigerator Perry
busts through the line!

04:59.900 --> 05:01.702
Hey, over here!
Mike Quick is wide open!

05:01.769 --> 05:02.936
I forgot my player's name!

05:03.003 --> 05:04.338
Cunningham heaves it!

05:04.672 --> 05:06.374
Yes!

05:06.440 --> 05:08.842
The Ref indicates touchdown
and wonders if he'll get
a chance to play.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.210
He won't!
Good job, dude.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.879
Dude, Barry.
Your arm is a cannon.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.916
And that's with a Nerf,
which is way harder to throw
than a real football.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.651
Wow. You know
a lot about science.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.220
COACH: All right, boys...
Uh, time to call it.
Real team needs the field.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.690
Damn it. I wish
my crazy mom
would let me play.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.191
If she didn't hold me back,

05:24.257 --> 05:26.093
I could have been
a star wide-receiver
for the Eagles.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.195
Forget your Mom,
just join the team
and don't tell her.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.964
We're talking
about Beverly Goldberg!

05:31.031 --> 05:34.535
Her only purpose
is to mix into our lives.

05:34.602 --> 05:37.938
So what I'm saying is,
I will no longer be able
to mix into your lives

05:38.005 --> 05:40.874
because I'm going to
become a QVC mogul.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.610
What?
I know.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.546
I won't be around as much
to take care of you.
It's hard for me, too.

05:45.613 --> 05:49.583
Then I should probably
call Chantal and make
a series of hair appointments.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.920
When won't you be around?
I need specifics.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.154
I guess, after school.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.923
So, you'll have
no idea where I am

05:55.989 --> 05:58.659
or what I'm playing
during the hours
of 3:00 to 5:00?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.794
If my business takes off,

06:00.861 --> 06:03.230
I may never be
at your school again.

06:03.296 --> 06:06.934
I'm so sad right now,
I need to try on these cleats.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.502
Anyway, off to bed.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.237
Wait.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.005
ADULT ADAM:
Barry thought he was busted.

06:12.072 --> 06:16.844
But instead my Mom
got a business idea
that fit like a glove.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.446
Little static cling, there.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.848
Bye now.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.017
ADULT ADAM:
A glove that would
fulfill her QVC dreams.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.187
Yep, like a mad genius
struck with a lightning bolt
of vision,

06:27.254 --> 06:30.824
my Mom called inspiration
from every part of her life.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.594
She snipped, sowed, measured
and worked around the clock

06:33.661 --> 06:35.996
to create the coolest jacket
the '80s had ever seen.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.230
Or, so she thought.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.000
So, what do you think?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.670
Look, I don't know
from fashion.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.973
But if you say it's stylish,
I'm sure they'll sell
like hot cakes.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.977
See the problem
with jean jackets is
they're almost entirely jean.

06:50.043 --> 06:55.015
But Bev-wear has
fun, flash, doily's
and tic-tac-toe.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.950
Those jackets
are gonna sell themselves.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.886
I love the new
supportive, Murray.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.355
Frankly he is different
than the man I originally
married, but he's great.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.224
So, now what?
You show this to QVC?

07:04.291 --> 07:07.294
Yes, I already sent them one
and I left ten messages.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.498
I find it very unprofessional
that they haven't
called me back yet.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.699
Even after I threatened them.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.033
Their loss.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.202
You know what we'll do?
We'll ship 'em off to Erica,

07:15.268 --> 07:17.404
all her arts
and college friends,
they'll flip for 'em.

07:17.471 --> 07:21.408
Yes! We'll get
the young tastemakers
to create some buzz.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.077
And then QVC'll come
knocking down our door.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.647
You've got a business plan,
little lady.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.182
ADULT ADAM:
And just like that,
my parents were convinced

07:29.249 --> 07:30.751
the jackets
were gonna be a hit.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.586
These jackets
straight up, suck, Dad.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.054
Stop. They do not.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.223
Why would you
encourage Mom to start
a fashion line?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.992
The lady wears
rainbow colored sweaters
with duck puns on them.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.260
It's a matter of figure.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.095
Ew!
Look, this important
to your mother.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.698
She put her heart and soul
into making those jackets.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.399
And that's very disturbing

07:46.466 --> 07:48.401
because they look
like they were bought
from a craft fair in Hell.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.170
I'm not asking for much here.

07:50.237 --> 07:54.274
Now go sell your mother's
expensive home-made jackets
to college kids.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.043
Look, this is
a lost cause, okay?

07:56.109 --> 07:58.345
You sent me a giant box
and I only sold one.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.347
And honestly,
I wasn't very ethical
about it.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.450
Okay, when I stumble home
from a frat party
at 4:00 in the morning,

08:03.517 --> 08:06.119
it is super not cool
to trick me into buying stuff.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.354
I'm on
a business call, Roomie.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.523
It was dark
and you said this was Gucci.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.424
Please just try
and sell a few more.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.126
Okay, fine.
But just to be clear,

08:13.193 --> 08:16.263
I have zero investment
in how this turns out.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.598
I want my money back.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.466
Honestly, the jacket
says sexy to me.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.434
Really?
'Cause to me, it just says...

08:21.501 --> 08:22.536
Jacket.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.671
Oh, that's bad.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.238
ADULT ADAM:
Yep. Bev-wear was nowhere,

08:25.305 --> 08:27.975
but my brother's
football career
was about to arrive.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.309
Your prayers
have been answered.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.545
Big Tasty is finally
joining the football team.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.314
We've been
through this, Goldberg.
Your mommy won't allow it.

08:34.381 --> 08:37.918
Well, my mommy's going
through a time-consuming
mid-life crisis,

08:37.985 --> 08:39.286
so now I get to
chase my dream.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.922
Our team could use
some of that Goldberg moxie.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.056
What are you
playing these days?

08:43.123 --> 08:44.625
Oh, I play it all.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.727
You'll probably have to
diagram some new plays

08:46.794 --> 08:49.229
to take advantage
of my amazing skill set.
May I?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.899
Normally I'd say no,
but I wanna see
where this goes.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.737
I call it the Hail Barry.

08:56.804 --> 09:01.675
In this play I both
throw and catch the winning
touchdown as time expires.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.410
That literally cannot be done.

09:03.476 --> 09:07.247
And yet I've done it
against my brother Adam
over seven times.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.549
All right,
let's hit the field
and see what you got!

09:12.653 --> 09:17.024
I'm unconscious!
I'm unconscious!
I've been knocked unconscious!

09:17.090 --> 09:19.627
Um, Coach, Goldberg
says he's unconscious
even though he's talking.

09:19.693 --> 09:20.761
You okay, Goldberg?

09:20.828 --> 09:22.362
Just a little
unconscious, Coach.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.864
hey, just thought
of something.

09:23.931 --> 09:27.100
Do you have
any of those Fig Newtons?
They always perk me back up.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.704
Lot of athletes
don't know this, but
the Newton is a power food.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.205
Power food, Goldberg?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.741
Man, get off the damn field.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.977
I'll handle this.
Yeah. We're handling it,
Assistant Coach Fast.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.813
Or should I just
say "Assistant?"

09:39.880 --> 09:41.649
Oh, hell no.
Okay, walk away, Ike.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.617
All right. Starter, line up.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.053
Let's move those chains!
Where do you want me, Coach?

09:46.119 --> 09:47.387
The bench.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.356
But if I'm on the bench,
how could I be
your star player?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.858
Well, it's
like this, Goldberg.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.226
You know when you gaze
into the dark night sky

09:53.293 --> 09:55.395
and you see
all those shimmering stars?

09:55.462 --> 09:56.664
I got a secret for you.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.165
They're not alone.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.134
There're a bunch of weak,
crappy stars right behind them

10:01.201 --> 10:02.803
on God's great space bench.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.405
Shining their dim,
pointless light.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.540
Think about it.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.544
I thought about it, Coach.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.714
And I don't wanna be
on the space bench.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.548
Please. I'm a star!

10:15.615 --> 10:18.418
ADULT ADAM: And, so,
Barry convinced Coach
to give him one last shot.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.589
I'm down.
I'm unconscious again.

10:25.292 --> 10:29.096
ADULT ADAM: My brother had
officially been benched and he
was not a good sport about it.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.698
Yo, wanna play
some Tecmo Bowl?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.433
No football for me.
Coach said I'm not
good enough to start.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.736
But football is your game.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.504
Did you tell him
about the Hail Barry?

10:37.570 --> 10:41.341
Many times!
It just seemed to annoy him.
Now I'm stuck on the bench.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.543
Know what I think?
Coach is testing you.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.113
We're talking
about sports, nerd.
What do you know?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.748
I know sports movies.

10:47.815 --> 10:51.284
And the Coach
always benches his star
to test his leadership.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.187
Oh, my God. I'm the star
of this real life movie.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.424
It's the only
logical conclusion.
What happens now?

10:57.490 --> 11:00.193
You just need to
prove to Coach that you
can unite your team

11:00.260 --> 11:02.562
in a highly unconventional
and cinematic way.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.465
That leaves
only one clear option.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.734
A football rap.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.569
Speaking as a guy who knows
nothing about sports,

11:09.636 --> 11:11.438
this makes all the sense
in the world!

11:11.504 --> 11:15.142
Time to blow off practice
and write some dope lyrics
to bond my squad.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.609
Sports!

11:16.676 --> 11:18.812
ADULT ADAM: As Big Tasty put
together an uplifting song,

11:18.879 --> 11:20.814
Bev-wear was falling apart
at the seams.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.818
Look at that.
You made a fresh
batch of jackets.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.220
(CRYING AND SPEAKING
GIBBERISH)

11:27.287 --> 11:28.756
What the hell?
She sent 'em all back?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.892
No, people want them.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.664
You're not a failure!

11:40.734 --> 11:43.336
I'm beyond positive.
Those kids aren't
even your market.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.809
A Bev-wear customer
is a sophisticated adult.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.311
Yeah. I'll even
sell 'em for you.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.750
ADULT ADAM:
Selling Bev-wear wasn't easy,

11:56.817 --> 11:59.452
but if anyone could do it,
it was my salesman Dad.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.455
Your total is $396.87,

12:02.522 --> 12:05.826
and just for today
with every sofa you buy,

12:05.893 --> 12:09.296
you get this
charming jacket half-price!

12:09.362 --> 12:10.998
No.
All right, 75% off.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.199
Just the couch, please.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.634
Hey, Mur.
How does
this jacket work?

12:14.701 --> 12:16.203
The pockets
are on the back.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.404
Not now, Al!

12:17.470 --> 12:19.973
How about this? Free.
You bought the sofa, take it.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.708
This jacket is very ugly.

12:21.775 --> 12:25.178
Mur, just come over
and unzip a pocket
on my back.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.947
I wanna put away
these Chiclets.

12:27.014 --> 12:31.051
All right, look.
Take the jacket! You don't
even have to wear it.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.485
Uh, put it on the snowman.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.686
Let's just forget
the whole thing.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.723
Hey! The sofa's free,
just take the jacket.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.392
It's a bad jacket.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.361
Bev can never know the truth.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.063
We'll take 'em
to a thrift store

12:43.130 --> 12:44.731
and then tell her
that they sold like crazy.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.499
It's a bad jacket.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.401
I know that, Al.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.339
* Big tasty
Wide receiver

12:52.405 --> 12:54.641
* I catch the ball
like a golden retriever

12:54.707 --> 12:57.010
* Unlike those dogs,
I don't have bad hips

12:57.077 --> 12:59.512
* I fly down the field
for touchdown trips

12:59.579 --> 13:01.714
* Ruben Jr.
Quarterback

13:01.781 --> 13:03.817
* I move so fast
I can't get sacked

13:03.884 --> 13:06.219
* I pass the ball
through the air

13:06.286 --> 13:08.555
* Come see me play
Pull up a chair

13:08.621 --> 13:11.258
* I'm Sergei Tarbakamus
I kick field goals

13:11.324 --> 13:13.360
* Am I nervous?
Yeah, I suppose

13:13.426 --> 13:14.862
Where the hell is everybody?

13:14.928 --> 13:15.996
SERGEI:
* By hitting the mark

13:16.063 --> 13:18.698
* The game is over
before it starts

13:18.765 --> 13:21.368
TEAM:
* Mellor's watching you

13:21.434 --> 13:23.336
* He's watching
Yes, he's watching

13:23.403 --> 13:28.575
* Quakers fight on through
Quakers fight on through

13:28.641 --> 13:30.543
They are really
gonna regret this.

13:30.610 --> 13:35.883
* If you don't,
you're gonna
make our coach angry! *

13:38.651 --> 13:40.921
Why the hell is my team
dancing with so little rhythm

13:40.988 --> 13:43.056
and not out on the field
doing drills?

13:43.123 --> 13:46.059
Well, as team leader,
I thought we could use
a little bonding.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.195
I made it clear
that you ride the pond.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.899
But... My brother said
you were testing me
like he saw in the movies.

13:51.965 --> 13:55.135
This is real life, son,
where people of
your meager skillset

13:55.202 --> 13:59.139
don't play, don't win
and don't get carried off
on somebody's shoulders.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.373
Hey, ease up, Coach.

14:00.440 --> 14:04.244
I don't need you to defend me,
Assistant Coach.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.447
'Cause, fact is,
if I don't play,
no one else will.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.150
Come on, fellas.
Let's get out of here.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.056
Really

14:16.123 --> 14:20.127
Sorry, bro. We barely
know you, and this has
all been really weird.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.794
Fine!

14:21.861 --> 14:25.332
If this team doesn't want me,
then I don't want me
on this team.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.170
Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe
I made all this money.

14:30.237 --> 14:33.340
That's what happens
when you sell out
all of your jackets.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.943
Aren't I right, Al?
Right-a-roo,
Captain Choo-Choo.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.010
What the hell
you talking about?

14:37.077 --> 14:39.512
I hate lying.
Don't make me a part of this.

14:39.579 --> 14:43.683
Hey! Who's the business mogul
with the wad of cash?

14:43.750 --> 14:45.618
Ha-ha!
I am so fired up.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.755
I gotta sow more stuff
on jackets right this minute.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.690
No, no, no!
Now's the time

14:50.757 --> 14:54.027
you relax and you enjoy
all your success.
Right, Al?

14:54.094 --> 14:55.628
Okey-dokey, Smokey Jokey.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.696
You okay, Dad?

14:57.864 --> 14:59.766
He is fine.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.036
Hi, I'm from
Jenkintown Swap Thrift Store.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.471
Is there
a Murray Goldberg here?

15:04.537 --> 15:07.474
I'm cracking, Murray.
I'm out.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.377
Yeah, I'm him. Uh, we got
a family thing going here.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.646
Look, we always appreciate
donations, but we can't take
these insane jackets.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.048
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.649
There's just so many of 'em
and it quickly became clear

15:16.716 --> 15:18.151
that we were gonna be stuck
with them forever.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.053
Yeah, that's
a lot of information.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.123
We have a few crazy-bag ladies
who will literally take
anything off our hands,

15:23.190 --> 15:25.392
but in this case, the jackets
just agitated them.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.893
No need to go on.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.461
We then dumped them
in the alley

15:28.528 --> 15:30.397
but all the street cats
instinctively attacked
the jackets.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.598
Now I gotta be rude!

15:34.634 --> 15:37.470
So, nobody wanted the jackets?

15:38.271 --> 15:39.973
I'm sorry, Bev.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.408
Guess this money is yours.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.843
No, it's for your business.
It's just a bump in the road.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.478
Just keep it.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.981
And all your loving support.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.785
The jackets were a failure
and so am I.

15:59.726 --> 16:03.063
ADULT ADAM: Even though
Barry was making the Eagles
crush the Patriots,

16:03.130 --> 16:05.365
his real life football career
was done.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.766
Hey, don't you have
a game tonight?

16:06.833 --> 16:09.169
No. Coach wasn't testing me.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.370
He thinks I suck.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.904
I don't know,
maybe he's right.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.840
ADULT ADAM: If I knew anything
about sports movies,

16:13.906 --> 16:16.909
this was the moment our hero
got an inspiring pep talk

16:16.976 --> 16:18.445
from the least likely
of places.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.946
On this day, it was me.

16:20.013 --> 16:23.050
Well, if there's one thing
I know, it's that
you can't just quit.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.951
Dude, enough with
your dumb sports movies.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.120
This isn't from a movie,
it's what I learned.

16:27.187 --> 16:31.724
Even if I don't ever
get a chance to play,
I can still help my team.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.960
Like how you filmed
the baseball games
like a weird creep.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.762
It's game film.
It helps them improve.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.764
Or like when the basketball
rolls under the bleachers

16:37.830 --> 16:38.865
and you climb under to get it.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.567
I fit in small spaces.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.970
So, even though
you're an unbearable loser
with no athletic ability

16:44.037 --> 16:46.539
and everyone talks about you
behind your back,

16:46.606 --> 16:48.308
you still find a way
to make a difference?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.243
And you can, too.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.344
Also, what?

16:51.411 --> 16:53.746
Thanks for
inspiring me, loser.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.715
Football team,
here I come.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.786
Thirty-one to nothing
in the first half.
What a disgrace!

16:59.852 --> 17:01.254
Coach, we're doing our best.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.890
Save the excuses
for Ruben Amaro Sr.,
Ruben Amaro Jr.

17:03.956 --> 17:07.960
Now I want someone here
to step up and show them
what we're made of!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.028
Anyone?

17:10.897 --> 17:12.965
Big Tasty.
Wide receiver.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.734
Dude, now's not the time.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.003
I catch the ball
like a golden retriever.

17:17.070 --> 17:20.140
What's he doing?
Unlike those dogs,
I don't have bad hips.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.610
What are you doing?
I fly down the field
for touchdown trips.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.112
Enough!

17:25.178 --> 17:27.514
* Mallor's watching you

17:27.580 --> 17:29.282
Reuben.
* He's watching
Yes he's watching

17:29.349 --> 17:30.383
I mean it!

17:30.450 --> 17:32.285
* And the Quakers
fight on through

17:32.352 --> 17:33.620
This song is not catchy.

17:33.686 --> 17:37.824
* Quakers fight on through
So better play that D

17:37.890 --> 17:39.759
* Play! Play! Play!

17:41.894 --> 17:44.831
* If you don't, you're gonna
make our coach angry *

17:44.897 --> 17:46.099
TEAM: Yeah!

17:46.166 --> 17:47.867
Now let's kick
Germantown's ass!

17:47.934 --> 17:49.769
TEAM: Yeah!

17:50.437 --> 17:52.038
Let's go, baby.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.973
I'm glad you didn't quit,
Goldberg.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.608
It's a nice ending
to your little movie.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.478
Thanks, Coach.
But you know what would be
an even better ending?

17:58.545 --> 18:01.548
We're not doing a Hail Barry
and you're still
never playing.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.216
Then you know
where to find me.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.818
I'll be on the bench,
dong nothing!

18:05.885 --> 18:07.954
Yes! Whoo!

18:08.020 --> 18:09.456
I don't even need this.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.795
What's going on here?

18:15.862 --> 18:19.232
Just the end of Bev-wear.
And the whole
stupid Bevolution.

18:19.299 --> 18:23.370
The Beverly Goldberg I know
never quits, ever.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.172
Well, there is a first time
for everything.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.806
I need to tell you something.

18:26.873 --> 18:30.143
Look, when I first met you,
when I was trying to make
something of myself,

18:30.210 --> 18:33.012
I failed at everything
that I tried.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.981
Well, I... I always knew
you'd make it.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.716
Exactly.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.551
You never stopped
believing in me.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.554
I'm giving you back
everything you gave me.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.490
Murray...

18:43.556 --> 18:44.657
So, you'll keep at it?

18:44.724 --> 18:48.895
Like you said,
Beverly Goldberg
never gives up.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.129
Ever.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.267
ADULT ADAM: With that,
the Bevolution was
back on track.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.203
And Barry was gonna
help lead his team,

18:56.269 --> 18:57.570
even if it was from the bench.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.739
Look alive, team!
Let's go, Quakers!

18:59.806 --> 19:03.343
Can you believe it, folks?
I may just be the sixth grade
Latin teacher,

19:03.410 --> 19:06.779
but I can safely say this is
the comeback of a lifetime.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.781
Yes! Touchdown!

19:08.848 --> 19:09.882
Watch for the sack!

19:09.949 --> 19:12.885
Yes, yes, yes! Go, go, go!

19:12.952 --> 19:14.387
Man, Barry rules
that bench.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.922
I can't take my eyes
off of him.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.191
Let's hear some noise, people.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.293
The actual players need us.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.794
Come on. There we go.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.796
Tazz is open. Hail Mary.

19:23.863 --> 19:27.234
He could go all the way!

19:27.300 --> 19:29.902
Yes! Yes! Yes!

19:29.969 --> 19:32.104
MERRILL REESE: Touchdown!
Quakers win!

19:32.171 --> 19:35.041
In all my three weeks
of announcing
high school football,

19:35.107 --> 19:38.245
I have never seen
anything like this!

19:38.311 --> 19:40.613
ADULT ADAM: My brother
never did become
an NFL wide receiver,

19:40.680 --> 19:43.916
but that day,
all his sports movie
fantasies came true.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.952
I'm a part of it.
I'm holding his heel!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.887
ADULT ADAM:
And as fate would have it,

19:47.954 --> 19:52.325
one day, Barry Goldberg
would finally get his chance
to fly like an eagle.

19:52.392 --> 19:57.230
* 'Cause we are the champions

19:58.130 --> 20:00.099
* Of the world

20:00.166 --> 20:01.901
Welcome to
the battle of the JTP.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.571
We've got Philadelphia Eagles
Hall of Famer, Mike Quick,

20:04.637 --> 20:06.939
playing automatic QB
for both sides.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.576
Ready, set, go!

20:09.642 --> 20:11.644
REESE: Look at the hands
on Goldberg.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.582
They say he could have been
a pro wide receiver if his
mother didn't hold him back.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.684
Schwartz sees nothing
but daylight.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.987
Very fitting since he's one of
Philly's top ophthalmologists.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.088
Damn it, Schwartz!

20:22.154 --> 20:23.189
And, go!

20:23.256 --> 20:24.991
REESE: My God.
It's the Hail Barry.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.926
And it didn't work.

20:26.993 --> 20:30.096
Because no one
can pass to themselves
in an actual game.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.999
And Naked Rob
has gone pants-less.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.634
Ten, go!

20:34.701 --> 20:36.936
REESE: Quick six.
Drops back to pass.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.005
Touchdown! Goldberg!

20:40.273 --> 20:42.475
On behalf of the entire
Eagles organization,

20:42.542 --> 20:45.278
we like to present
the winners of the JTP Bowl.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.479
And here are your winners,

20:46.546 --> 20:49.115
the one and only JTP!

20:53.286 --> 20:56.423
E-A-G-L-E-S! Oh!

21:03.296 --> 21:05.231
This is the real
Beverly Goldberg.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.699
She has graced us today.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.337
So I snuck into
Barry's room and took
one of his jean jackets.

21:10.403 --> 21:13.706
And I decided I was going
to decorate them things.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.343
The hand was like
a Michael Jackson hand.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.810
A pillow on the back.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.211
Very punk rock.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.714
It's very big because
it was Barry's jacket.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.583
This thing weighs
a  thousand pounds.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.052
And was, like, super big,
and I...

21:26.118 --> 21:27.219
Let's get
the shoulder pads in...

21:27.286 --> 21:29.188
Did you ever sell
any of your...
Not a one.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.957
I had never sold
one jacket.
