WEBVTT

00:04.340 --> 00:05.820
Ma, Ma, calm down.

00:06.010 --> 00:06.780
Listen to me.

00:06.850 --> 00:08.610
I know it says click
with the mouse,

00:08.620 --> 00:11.280
but on a laptop,
the trackpad is the mouse.

00:11.290 --> 00:13.820
Now, put your finger on it.

00:13.820 --> 00:16.460
Doesn't matter which finger.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.490
Good choice.

00:18.490 --> 00:22.400
Now move it down
to your e-mail icon.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.260
Yeah, the little envelope.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.700
What do you mean,
"What does it look like?"

00:26.700 --> 00:28.770
It looks like an envelope!

00:28.770 --> 00:30.440
Fine, you don't like
the computer,

00:30.440 --> 00:32.240
don't use it!

00:32.240 --> 00:35.780
Sure, we can exchange it
for a salad spinner. Good-bye!

00:38.280 --> 00:42.110
That's a Hanukkah present
you're regretting, huh?

00:42.120 --> 00:44.680
I won't say that
all senior citizens

00:44.690 --> 00:48.350
who can't master technology
should be publicly flogged,

00:48.360 --> 00:50.860
but if we made an
example of one or two,

00:50.860 --> 00:53.290
it might give the others
incentive to try harder.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.330
I had a great idea.

00:56.330 --> 00:57.800
You know how
we're always having

00:57.800 --> 00:59.700
to stop and solve
differential equations,

00:59.700 --> 01:01.550
like when you're doing
Fourier analysis,

01:01.550 --> 01:03.870
or using the
Schrodinger equation?

01:03.870 --> 01:06.090
Howard doesn't.
He's only an engineer.

01:07.470 --> 01:10.580
I was thinking,
we could write a little app

01:10.580 --> 01:12.280
that would use
handwriting recognition,

01:12.280 --> 01:14.550
and then run it through a
symbolic evaluation engine.

01:14.550 --> 01:15.850
You just use your smartphone,

01:15.850 --> 01:19.020
take a picture
of the equation and bam!

01:19.020 --> 01:23.120
You know what's a great app?
The one that makes fart noises.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.930
You know, Leonard,

01:28.930 --> 01:30.700
that's actually
a valid idea.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.130
Very good.

01:32.130 --> 01:35.640
Can you say that and not
make it sound like I'm a cat

01:35.640 --> 01:38.370
who learned
how to use the toilet?

01:38.370 --> 01:40.240
No.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.210
The two achievements
are equally surprising

01:42.210 --> 01:43.680
and equally admirable,

01:43.680 --> 01:44.980
though if pressed,

01:44.980 --> 01:47.410
I'd have to give
a slight edge to the cat.

01:47.410 --> 01:49.220
I'll save you the pain
and nervousness

01:49.220 --> 01:50.580
of waiting for the answer.

01:50.580 --> 01:54.720
I agree to be part of
your project. Congratulations.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.790
Oh, yay for me.

01:56.790 --> 01:59.480
What about you guys?

01:59.480 --> 02:00.610
I can't promise anything,

02:00.610 --> 02:02.900
but people do make money
off stuff like this.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.310
A few extra bucks
would be nice.

02:04.310 --> 02:06.270
I could finally move out
of my mother's house.

02:06.270 --> 02:07.530
Where would you go?

02:07.530 --> 02:10.139
I always dreamed about building
a little place of my own

02:10.139 --> 02:12.000
over the garage.

02:12.010 --> 02:15.510
You know, if I made more money,
I could take time off from work

02:15.510 --> 02:17.440
and give pretty girls
submarine rides.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.680
What's that?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.010
Some weird sex thing?

02:21.010 --> 02:22.520
No.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.180
You take pretty girls underwater

02:24.180 --> 02:26.450
in your private submarine,
and you show them fish.

02:26.450 --> 02:30.160
Why does everything
have to be dirty with you?

02:30.160 --> 02:32.560
I was thinking we could work
on this at night,

02:32.560 --> 02:34.530
and then maybe
in a couple of weeks,

02:34.530 --> 02:36.230
we'll have ourselves an app
to sell.

02:36.230 --> 02:37.500
Sounds like
we're in business.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.100
I think we should take a picture
to capture this moment.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.900
Yeah.
Oh!

02:46.140 --> 02:50.480

No one is doing

03:18.240 --> 03:20.630
handwriting-recognition
differential equation solving.

03:20.630 --> 03:23.310
Oh, dear Lord, shush.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.120
What?

03:25.120 --> 03:27.690
You have so few good ideas,
Leonard.

03:27.690 --> 03:29.590
And you're just going
to spill the beans

03:29.590 --> 03:32.190
in front of an outsider?

03:37.260 --> 03:39.230
Who, me?

03:39.230 --> 03:41.450
Sheldon, I don't think

Whatever your secret is,

04:01.970 --> 04:04.070
I'm sure it's boring,
so I'm not interested.

04:04.070 --> 04:05.690
It's not boring at all.

04:05.690 --> 04:07.290
You see,
in higher order mathematics,

04:07.290 --> 04:08.490
there are certain sets

04:08.490 --> 04:10.260
of equations that...
Bored.

04:10.260 --> 04:12.310
Satisfied?

04:12.310 --> 04:13.630
Hardly.

04:13.630 --> 04:16.329
Consider this unlikely
but very plausible scenario.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.070
A young woman alone
in the big city.

04:19.070 --> 04:20.470
Her ridiculous dream

04:20.470 --> 04:23.270
of becoming an actress
lies shattered about her.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.840
Hey, wait a minute.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.810
Well, hang on. Let's
see where he's going.

04:26.810 --> 04:28.250
Then it hits her.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.010
How is she going to survive?

04:30.020 --> 04:33.530
I mean, she has no prospects,
no marketable skills.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.000
And then one day,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.120
she meets a group of geniuses

04:37.120 --> 04:39.060
and their friend Howard.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.930
Hey, I...

04:42.930 --> 04:44.900
Hang on.
Let's see where he's going.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.630
She befriends them,
and then lies in wait

04:48.630 --> 04:51.270
until they reveal
a marketable idea,

04:51.270 --> 04:54.210
which she steals
and sells to the highest bidder.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.340
- That is ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

04:56.340 --> 04:57.940
Let's see you come up
with an explanation

04:57.940 --> 05:00.650
as to why this woman hangs out
with us all the time.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.980
Oh, great. You know what?

05:05.980 --> 05:07.570
I've already mooched
dinner off you guys.

05:07.570 --> 05:08.920
I don't need to listen to this.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.520
There's your answer--
free food.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.330
All right,
I've taken the liberty

05:14.330 --> 05:16.260
of drafting
these workflow charts

05:16.260 --> 05:18.960
which outline our various duties
and the path we will follow

05:18.960 --> 05:21.300
as we develop
our ground-breaking new app.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.870
Hey, why am I in charge
of phone support?

05:26.970 --> 05:29.940
Seems a bit racist.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.710
A customer service
representative

05:31.710 --> 05:34.250
with an Indian accent
will create the impression

05:34.250 --> 05:36.850
we're a vast enterprise that
uses overseas call centers.

05:36.850 --> 05:38.480
Oh.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.820
Very clever.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.890
But still racist.

05:41.890 --> 05:45.920
Duly noted, Steve
from Wichita.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.560
Why am I listed as your
executive assistant?

05:49.560 --> 05:52.330
Because the word "secretary"
has fallen into disrepute.

05:52.330 --> 05:55.230
FYI, my mother's
birthday is coming up.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.040
I'm going to need you
to pick up a present.

05:59.140 --> 06:01.460
Okay, we need
to stop for a minute.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.010
Leonard, please,
we can talk during our break.

06:03.010 --> 06:04.480
We have one coming up
at midnight.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.640
We'll need snacks.

06:06.650 --> 06:07.950
Sheldon, you're not in charge.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.800
It's my idea.
I'm in charge.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.050
Oh, of course you are.

06:11.050 --> 06:12.380
Look at the organizational
chart.

06:12.380 --> 06:13.880
You're clearly listed
as founder.

06:13.890 --> 06:16.020
Well, yes, and you're listed

06:16.020 --> 06:18.060
as Chief Executive Officer,

06:18.060 --> 06:20.830
Chief Financial Officer
and Chief Operating Officer.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.440
You missed
Chief Science Officer,

06:22.440 --> 06:25.330
Chairman of the Board, and Head
of the Secret Santa Committee.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.370
Okay.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.120
You need to get clear
on this right now.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.170
I am in charge of this project.

06:32.170 --> 06:37.790
Ooh. Leonard's going all
alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass...

06:37.790 --> 06:40.280
All right. All right,
I'm not going to argue with you.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.460
Sheldon Cooper is nothing
if not a team player.

06:42.460 --> 06:44.950
Dr. Hofstadter,
you have the conn.

06:46.850 --> 06:48.890
Thank you.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.150
I thought we might start

06:50.160 --> 06:51.840
by talking
about the user interface.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.390
Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.830
So this button here

06:57.830 --> 07:00.130
will allow you
to scan a new equation,

07:00.130 --> 07:01.700
but over here,
you can press this,

07:01.700 --> 07:04.240
and just substitute new values
for the coefficients.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.990
Good one, boss.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.780
What?

07:10.780 --> 07:12.140
This diagram.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.610
I assume
you were opening with a joke.

07:14.610 --> 07:18.680
It certainly buoyed up
this employee's esprit de corps.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.920
It's not a joke.
It's the real design.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.990
In that case, may I offer
27 little tweaks

07:24.990 --> 07:27.290
to make it
slightly less embarrassing?

07:27.290 --> 07:29.330
Sheldon, I think
this will work.

07:29.330 --> 07:30.930
Let's just try it my way.

07:30.930 --> 07:32.430
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

07:32.430 --> 07:33.680
I assumed that you wanted

07:33.680 --> 07:35.770
candid truth-telling
from your employees,

07:35.770 --> 07:38.240
but I realize now,
you want the mindless nattering

07:38.240 --> 07:40.870
of complacent
yes-men.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.110
Are you done?

07:42.110 --> 07:44.040
If you say so, boss.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.080
So right now,
this button-press event

07:48.080 --> 07:50.050
is just triggering
a dummy procedure call...

07:50.050 --> 07:52.080
How about this
for the app name?

07:52.080 --> 07:54.890
The Surprisingly
Helpful Equation-Linked

07:54.890 --> 07:57.410
Differential
Optimized Numerator.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.960
So it spells "Sheldon."

08:02.890 --> 08:04.080
Does it?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.160
A happy accident.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.900
We're not doing
names now. Howard?

08:09.900 --> 08:11.920
Like I was saying, right now
it's just a dummy procedure,

08:11.920 --> 08:13.240
but eventually,
it will drop us into...

08:13.240 --> 08:14.340
All right, fine.

08:14.340 --> 08:15.870
If we're not going
to give it a name,

08:15.870 --> 08:18.040
can we at least give it
a secret code designation?

08:18.040 --> 08:20.040
- No.
- Hear me out.

08:20.050 --> 08:22.410
The atomic bomb
was The Manhattan Project.

08:22.410 --> 08:25.270
Windows 95 was originally
Project Chicago.

08:25.270 --> 08:29.750
For our app, I would humbly
suggest Project Nodlehs.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.190
That's just
"Sheldon" backwards.

08:33.190 --> 08:35.190
Another happy accident.

08:35.190 --> 08:38.929
We're not wasting time
with names right now.

08:38.929 --> 08:40.559
I see.

08:40.570 --> 08:42.230
Is that decision open
for discussion?

08:42.230 --> 08:43.750
No.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.600
Is the decision to not
discuss it open for discussion?

08:46.610 --> 08:47.770
No.

08:47.770 --> 08:49.260
Again,

08:49.260 --> 08:51.180
right now it's just
a dummy procedure,

08:51.180 --> 08:53.610
but eventually,
it will drop us into...

08:53.610 --> 08:55.300
I call for a vote
of no confidence

08:55.300 --> 08:56.680
and an immediate change
in leadership.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.080
Sheldon, stop it.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.180
When in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary

09:00.190 --> 09:01.440
to dissolve the bonds

09:01.440 --> 09:03.190
that tie three competent
scientists together...

09:03.190 --> 09:05.090
That's enough, Sheldon.
All right, let's get right to the vote.

09:05.090 --> 09:06.970
Show of hands--
all those opposed

09:06.980 --> 09:08.790
to Leonard
and his reign of tyranny.

09:11.230 --> 09:12.730
Okay, that's it, you're fired.

09:12.730 --> 09:14.700
Really?

09:14.700 --> 09:16.670
Why?

09:17.600 --> 09:20.910
Because you're impossible
to work with.

09:20.910 --> 09:22.620
I see.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.710
And is that open
for discussion?

09:34.250 --> 09:35.390
What are you doing?

09:35.390 --> 09:38.360
Oh. Good morning, shoemaker.

09:39.490 --> 09:40.590
I think you'll be pleased

09:40.590 --> 09:42.560
with what the elves were up to
last night.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.460
But I fired you.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.730
Oh, I know. I'm now
an independent contractor.

09:46.730 --> 09:50.150
No, you are
now nothing.

09:50.150 --> 09:53.100
You have no connection
to this project whatsoever.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.540
But I made it better.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.780
I don't want it better.
I want it my way.

09:57.780 --> 10:01.210
Well, that speaks volumes,
doesn't it?

10:01.210 --> 10:05.120
All right, I suppose
I'll go put on my bus pants.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.370
What the hell are bus pants?

10:07.370 --> 10:09.820
They are pants one wears
over one's regular pants

10:09.820 --> 10:11.320
when one sits on bus seats

10:11.320 --> 10:13.690
that other people
have previously sat on.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.180
But perhaps
from your lofty heights

10:17.180 --> 10:19.100
atop the corporate ladder,
you've lost touch

10:19.100 --> 10:22.130
with the struggles
of the common man.

10:22.130 --> 10:25.000
Look, I'm still happy
to drive you to work.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.840
Nothing's changed
in that regard.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.810
We're still roommates,
we're still friends.

10:29.810 --> 10:32.240
Except you identified me,
your best friend,

10:32.240 --> 10:34.750
as a gangrenous limb
that needed to be severed

10:34.750 --> 10:36.360
from the organism
and tossed away.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.320
The desperate act
of a little man

10:39.320 --> 10:41.790
with a big Napoleon complex.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.620
You know what?

10:44.620 --> 10:46.920
Go put on your bus pants.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.480
Mm. Last night,
I had a dream

10:55.490 --> 10:57.090
we got so rich from the app,

10:57.090 --> 10:59.500
you and I bought matching
side-by-side mansions.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.300
But...

11:02.300 --> 11:03.750
there was a secret tunnel

11:03.750 --> 11:06.840
connecting your front yard
to my back yard.

11:11.710 --> 11:13.270
What do you think that means?

11:14.640 --> 11:18.400
It means after we play handball,
I'm showering at home.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.620
Good morning, Friend Howard.

11:23.620 --> 11:24.920
Friend Raj.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.460
I see you gentlemen
are enjoying beverages.

11:27.460 --> 11:30.860
Perhaps they would taste better
out of these.

11:32.260 --> 11:34.200
"World's Greatest
Astrophysicist"?

11:34.200 --> 11:36.760
Don't thank me. You earned it.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.200
"Howard Wolowitz."

11:42.100 --> 11:45.270
Why not
"World's Greatest Engineer"?

11:45.270 --> 11:46.370
I'm sorry.

11:46.380 --> 11:48.110
I typed that
into the label maker,

11:48.110 --> 11:49.440
but I just couldn't press enter.

11:49.450 --> 11:51.630
Now down to business.

11:51.630 --> 11:54.820
What would it take for you
to abandon Leonard

11:54.820 --> 11:56.350
and join me in a rival company?

11:56.350 --> 11:58.520
Unless, of course,
the mugs are sufficient,

11:58.520 --> 12:01.060
in which case, welcome aboard.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.220
We're not quitting on Leonard.

12:03.230 --> 12:06.060
I understand.
Your loyalty is admirable.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.700
But what if I were
to up the ante?

12:09.700 --> 12:11.870
What are you talking about?

12:11.870 --> 12:14.400
Monogrammed key chains

12:14.400 --> 12:17.210
with a built-in laser pointer.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.910
No?

12:22.960 --> 12:24.800
How about can cozies

12:24.800 --> 12:28.420
emblazoned
with our university mascot?

12:28.420 --> 12:31.220
Go, Beavers.

12:32.190 --> 12:34.260
I'll be back.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.090
Okay, let's try this one.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.330
"Spherical Hankel function."

12:43.330 --> 12:44.900
Hold on.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.070
That's it!

12:46.070 --> 12:47.270
Eureka!

12:47.270 --> 12:49.100
Hey, we agreed when
it was "Eureka" time,

12:49.100 --> 12:51.110
we were all gonna
say it together.

12:51.110 --> 12:52.310
Fine.

12:52.310 --> 12:53.310
Let's say it together.

12:53.310 --> 12:55.340
No. The moment
has passed.

12:55.340 --> 12:58.050
Greetings, gentlemen.

12:58.050 --> 13:00.080
How goes your
little project?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.320
You mean,
"Project Lenwoloppali"?

13:03.320 --> 13:06.620
Ah, a combination
of all your names.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.710
Very clever.

13:07.710 --> 13:10.490
I assume "Koothranardowitz"
was taken?

13:12.060 --> 13:13.830
We're actually
scanning equations

13:13.830 --> 13:15.200
and getting good results.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.520
Oh, well then,
by all means, carry on.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.430
I wouldn't want
to impede your progress.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.940
Howard, did you solve
the install time problem yet?

13:21.940 --> 13:23.470
No. It's a little tricky.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.440
I'm gonna try having it pick up
the libraries dyn...

13:32.730 --> 13:34.320
What are you doing?!

13:34.320 --> 13:38.120
Playing the theremin.

13:39.660 --> 13:42.890
No. I mean, what are you
doing with a theremin?

13:42.890 --> 13:45.430
Playing it.

13:45.430 --> 13:48.660
I've loved the theremin
from the first moment

13:48.660 --> 13:50.800
I heard the original
<i>Star Trek</i> theme.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.270
And it's been killing me

13:52.270 --> 13:55.240
that it just sits in my closet,
gathering dust.

13:57.000 --> 14:03.074

Sheldon!
We're working here!

14:11.520 --> 14:12.790
That's all right.

14:12.790 --> 14:16.660
I can barely hear you
over my theremin.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.970
Well, that was a
little uncalled for.

14:24.970 --> 14:26.930
No, that was
completely called for.

14:26.940 --> 14:28.290
We need quiet.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.640
So, your project is more
important than mine?

14:30.640 --> 14:34.880
Well, seeing as your project
is to sabotage my project, yes.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.440
Don't beat around the bush,
Leonard.

14:36.450 --> 14:37.480
If you don't want me here,

14:37.480 --> 14:39.410
just say the word,
and I'll leave.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.350

around the bush a little.

of my own apartment.

Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

15:32.970 --> 15:34.850
He wouldn't drive me
to work today.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.020
I had to wear
my bus pants.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.940
- Is that so?
- Yes.

15:38.940 --> 15:40.340
And they're
still sticky.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.510
Aw...

15:41.510 --> 15:43.610
Probably going to have
to throw them away.

15:45.710 --> 15:48.150
Hey, you don't need
Leonard and his app.

15:48.150 --> 15:49.420
You can make one with me.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.190
With you?

15:52.760 --> 15:55.260
Seriously,
I have a great idea for one.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.790
Is it better than your idea
to move to Los Angeles

15:57.790 --> 15:59.490
and become a famous actress?

16:01.840 --> 16:02.440
Okay, look...

16:02.480 --> 16:04.340
when you see someone
wearing shoes you like,

16:04.340 --> 16:05.720
you just snap a picture of them,

16:05.720 --> 16:07.260
and the app goes on the Internet

16:07.260 --> 16:08.790
to find out
where you can buy them.

16:08.790 --> 16:11.090
That's your app idea?

16:11.090 --> 16:12.030
Well, you don't like it?

16:12.030 --> 16:14.130
I didn't say that.
But no, I don't.

16:14.130 --> 16:16.660
Why not?

16:16.670 --> 16:18.170
Oh, Penny,
where do I begin?

16:18.170 --> 16:20.630
The simple-mindedness
of your idea

16:20.640 --> 16:24.240
is exceeded only by its
crass consumerism and banality.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.140
And Leonard didn't want
to work with you?

16:26.140 --> 16:27.780
Imagine that.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.580
I know, it's baffling.

Sheldon, I'm gonna
make some cocoa.

16:39.660 --> 16:41.260
Do you want some?

16:41.260 --> 16:43.020
Do you make it
with milk or water?

16:43.030 --> 16:44.690
- Milk.
- Real cocoa?

16:44.690 --> 16:46.760
That's what it says
on the packet.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.960
Do you have
those little marshmallows?

16:48.960 --> 16:49.930
No, sorry.

16:49.930 --> 16:52.370
Well, I suppose
it's appropriate.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.470
What does that mean?

16:53.470 --> 16:57.270
A disappointing drink
for a disappointing day.

17:00.110 --> 17:01.380
Hey, look at this.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.410
20 people from the university
have already signed up

17:03.410 --> 17:04.910
for our private beta.

17:04.910 --> 17:06.180
I'm telling you,

17:06.180 --> 17:08.250
the Lenwoloppali
Differential Equation Scanner

17:08.250 --> 17:11.119
meets a real need.
We've got a hit.

17:11.119 --> 17:12.589
What do you think we
should sell it for?

17:12.589 --> 17:15.190
Well, based on the fact
that our potential market

17:15.190 --> 17:17.230
is about 70 or 80 guys,

17:17.230 --> 17:18.359
and you want a submarine,

17:18.359 --> 17:20.190
I'd say about a
million dollars a pop.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.500
Well, what if we put out a lite
version for half a million?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.300
You know,
get the word of mouth going.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.500
Hi. I'm sorry
to bother you guys,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.300
but you've got to come
take your Sheldon back.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.110
What's he doing
in your apartment?

17:32.110 --> 17:34.540
Well, he was moping down in the
lobby, so I invited him over.

17:34.540 --> 17:35.810
Now I regret it.

17:35.810 --> 17:38.430
Why do you regret...
Uh, never mind, stupid question.

17:38.430 --> 17:40.820
Look, can't you just let him
play with you until bedtime?

17:40.820 --> 17:43.900
We're not playing.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.090
This is real work.

17:45.090 --> 17:47.260
We're going to
be hundred-aires.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.960
Okay. What if I got him
to apologize

17:49.960 --> 17:51.330
and promise to behave?

17:54.600 --> 17:57.400
Then I guess we would
let him back on the app team,

17:57.400 --> 17:59.700
and while we're doing that,
you could take an aerial tour

17:59.700 --> 18:02.870
of L.A. on your flying pig.

18:02.870 --> 18:05.010
Okay. Wait right here.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.710
I'll tell you one thing.
If I get rich enough,

18:08.710 --> 18:11.910
that's the kind of girl I want
to take on a submarine ride.

18:12.850 --> 18:16.020
And yes, that time,
I meant it to be dirty.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.750
Really?

18:19.760 --> 18:21.390
Leonard wants me back?

18:21.390 --> 18:24.530
Oh, yes. He says they
are lost without you.

18:24.530 --> 18:28.200
Well, we sure saw that coming.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.650
That's right.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.930
You know what
I'm going to do?

18:30.930 --> 18:34.440
I am going to sit here
and just let them stew.

18:38.410 --> 18:39.410
No, no, no. You know,

18:39.410 --> 18:41.040
they have
suffered enough.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.510
Everybody's
suffered enough.

18:43.510 --> 18:46.680
The thing is, you're going
to have to offer him

18:46.680 --> 18:48.720
a face-saving
way out of this.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.880
How?

18:49.890 --> 18:51.090
Say you're sorry.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.720
Oh, no.

18:52.720 --> 18:56.220
Mrs. Mary Cooper
didn't raise her no liars.

18:56.230 --> 18:59.330
Okay. Um...

18:59.330 --> 19:01.130
How about this? You know
how you're always trying

19:01.130 --> 19:02.330
to learn about sarcasm?

19:02.330 --> 19:04.100
No.
No?

19:04.100 --> 19:05.770
I was being sarcastic.

19:06.870 --> 19:09.100
Oh. Good for you.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.510
So all you have to do here
is say you're sorry to Leonard,

19:11.510 --> 19:13.240
but say it
sarcastically.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.440
Of course.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.380
He will hear it as an attempt
to mend fences,

19:18.380 --> 19:20.750
as opposed
to the withering condemnation

19:20.750 --> 19:22.520
you and I will know it to be.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.040
Yeah. Yeah, that
was my plan.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.290
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.820
Oh, by the way,
thank you

19:27.820 --> 19:29.690
for the delicious cocoa.

19:29.690 --> 19:30.690
Oh, you're welcome.

19:30.690 --> 19:32.490
Boy, I'm getting
good at this.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.170
Okay, now that you're
back on the team,

19:38.170 --> 19:39.170
let's get you caught up.

19:39.170 --> 19:41.670
Before you begin,
let me say again

19:41.670 --> 19:44.740
how deeply sorry I am
for my earlier behavior

19:44.740 --> 19:48.980
and how much I respect
and admire your leadership.

19:48.980 --> 19:52.780
Thank you.

19:56.890 --> 19:58.250
So as you can see,

19:58.250 --> 20:01.090
not only can you store
your favorite equations,

20:01.090 --> 20:03.290
but you can forward them
to your friends

20:03.290 --> 20:06.590
or post them on Facebook
right from the app.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.660
Well, I must say,
I am impressed.

20:08.660 --> 20:09.750
Thanks.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.000
You all have clearly put
in a lot of hard work.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.170
We have.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.400
As a result,
you have taken

20:14.400 --> 20:16.540
the most important step
on the road to success:

20:16.540 --> 20:18.220
learning what not to do.

20:18.220 --> 20:20.040
Now, let's start fresh.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.640
Howard, we're going
to need some tea.

20:29.230 --> 20:31.870
Okay, these are Uggs.

20:31.870 --> 20:34.570
These are Crocs.

20:34.570 --> 20:36.940
These are knockoff
Manolo Blahniks.

20:36.940 --> 20:38.510
Bored.

20:38.510 --> 20:41.490
Look, you said it yourself,
we have to create a database

20:41.490 --> 20:43.610
before you can write
an alga-thingy.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.010
Algorithm.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.410
You see, Penny, Alan Turing
defined an algorithm...

20:47.420 --> 20:49.180
Bored.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.180
Okay.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.990
These are Steve Maddens.

20:51.990 --> 20:53.890
These are Nine West.

20:53.890 --> 20:57.390
These are Target. Oh, but don't
they look like Chanel?

20:57.390 --> 20:58.590
These are
Michael Kors...
