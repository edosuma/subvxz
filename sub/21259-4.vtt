WEBVTT

00:05.573 --> 00:06.340
- Why did we agree
to do Thanksgiving

00:07.108 --> 00:09.110
in the suburbs
with Brooke's family?

00:09.143 --> 00:10.578
My S.P.D. is flaring up.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.513
- Honey, Suburban
Panic Disorder

00:12.546 --> 00:14.048
is not a real thing.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.450
- Tell that to my pit stains
and cottonmouth.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.152
- I don't care for the
suburbs either, hon but

00:18.186 --> 00:20.121
...at least
they're beautiful.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.222
- Are they?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.390
Behind all the potlucks

00:22.423 --> 00:24.358
and Lilly Pulitzer
shift dresses

00:24.392 --> 00:26.594
lurks an insidious darkness.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.529
All the husbands
are alkies.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.532
All the wives are
popping pills like Tic Tacs.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.535
I'm talking Zipper Mouthed
Leather Man in the cellar.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.238
- Okay, I take that back,
you 100% have

00:37.271 --> 00:38.472
Suburban Panic Disorder.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.573
- We're about to have
Thanksgiving

00:39.607 --> 00:41.509
with actual Puritans.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.277
Some of them
are so inbred,

00:43.311 --> 00:44.578
that they're born
with a sixth finger

00:44.612 --> 00:46.414
that they have
removed at birth.

00:46.447 --> 00:49.450
Hey! Five bucks to the first
person who feels a nub!

00:49.483 --> 00:51.519
- Yeah!
- Yes!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.154
- Kids, none of
this is true.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.356
[disappointed groans]

00:55.389 --> 00:58.092
- Really? We need a
family safe word.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.560
If anyone is in
need of a rescue,

00:59.593 --> 01:02.163
just say "Cul de Sac"
okay?

01:02.196 --> 01:03.831
- Nod and smile, kids.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.433
- Today I'm going to
blow the lid off

01:05.466 --> 01:08.836
the lie that is the
"perfect" suburbs.

01:08.869 --> 01:12.640
[theme music]
* Hey yes you know

01:12.673 --> 01:16.110
* I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling fine *

01:17.211 --> 01:19.680
- Barrett, your home
is so festive.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.183
- Aw, well when
one's ancestors

01:22.216 --> 01:23.451
came over
on the Mayflower

01:23.484 --> 01:26.287
one tends to go overboard
on Thanksgiving.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.855
No pun intended.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.457
- You hear that, Andy?

01:29.490 --> 01:31.459
Barrett's ancestors
were Pilgrims.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.593
- I had no idea.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.295
- We're everywhere.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.197
The whole town is
probably related.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.498
Hi gang!

01:37.531 --> 01:39.367
- Thatcher, why don't you
take the children

01:39.400 --> 01:41.469
upstairs to rehearse?

01:43.371 --> 01:44.672
Thatcher wrote a play

01:44.705 --> 01:47.608
about the very first
Thanksgiving.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.177
- We're going to be
best friends!

01:49.210 --> 01:50.511
- Aw!

01:50.544 --> 01:52.313
- [whispers] I'm gonna
make you my bitch.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.681
- Cul de--!

01:53.714 --> 01:54.682
- Happy Thanksgiving!

01:54.715 --> 01:56.184
- You too, Berkley.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.451
- You remember
my husband, Lockhart?

01:57.485 --> 01:58.919
- Absolutely, nice
to see you.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.355
- Lockhart, a pleasure.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.291
- No nub.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.292
- Play nice.

02:04.325 --> 02:08.329
- Oh and give a wave to
Hawthorn over there.

02:08.362 --> 02:08.996
- So, Andy.

02:09.029 --> 02:09.663
How long did it
take you

02:09.697 --> 02:10.231
to get here
from the city?

02:10.264 --> 02:11.232
About a half an hour?

02:11.265 --> 02:13.267
- You know, everyone who
lives out here says

02:13.301 --> 02:14.268
it's a half an hour,

02:14.302 --> 02:15.603
but it's always an hour.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.537
- Sounds like we got
a city slicker

02:16.570 --> 02:20.608
who's too chicken to
drive on the shoulder!

02:20.641 --> 02:22.276
- It may have taken me a
little longer to get out here,

02:22.310 --> 02:23.644
but I did make it
the full 33 miles

02:23.677 --> 02:25.546
on electricity only.
- No?

02:25.579 --> 02:27.615
- Yeah.
- You take 95

02:27.648 --> 02:28.649
or the Merritt?
- The Merritt.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.550
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.952
- God, they're talking
routes, shoot me!

02:31.985 --> 02:32.753
- The Merrit's
the way to go.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.955
- Yeah the Merritt.
- Definitely.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.391
- Oh well.
Baby number four!

02:37.425 --> 02:38.459
- It's five actually.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.362
- Five?!
Mazel.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.363
Do you know
what you're having?

02:42.396 --> 02:43.431
- We'll find out tomorrow.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.467
I am actually hosting
Berkley's gender reveal party.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.535
- Yeah!

02:47.568 --> 02:48.536
- Oh, like where you
open a box

02:48.569 --> 02:50.471
and if pink balloons
shoot out, it's a girl,

02:50.504 --> 02:52.373
and if they're blue,
it's a boy?

02:52.406 --> 02:54.975
Balloons murder tens
of birds a year, Jill.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.944
So I guess it's the
same thing,

02:56.977 --> 02:58.779
minus the mass
casualties.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.813
You should come!

02:59.847 --> 03:01.549
Barrett's parties are the
talk of the township.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.983
She's the best
sister ever.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.418
- Best hostess ever.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.254
I can't believe you're
hosting Thanksgiving

03:06.287 --> 03:08.322
and then another party
on "Black Friday."

03:08.356 --> 03:11.459
- Oh Jill, let's not discuss
politics today, okay?

03:11.492 --> 03:13.294
- No, I meant the
shopping stampede.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.595
- Let's not.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.265
- Okay. I'm just
gonna get--

03:17.298 --> 03:19.367
- Thanks.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.802
- Dying. Where are
Brooke and Lex?

03:21.835 --> 03:23.237
- Lex texted me
ten ninutes ago.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.372
They just got in the Uber.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.673
- Ten minutes ago?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.007
Why didn't they
take their own car?

03:27.040 --> 03:27.708
- I don't know.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.776
[rapid breaths]

03:28.809 --> 03:30.244
- Deep breaths.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.512
- I'm not gonna make it.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.247
I don't belong
in the suburbs.

03:33.281 --> 03:33.814
Look at me!

03:33.847 --> 03:34.982
I'm Edward Scissorhands

03:35.015 --> 03:36.817
but without
scissors for hands.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.352
- You are not--

03:38.386 --> 03:41.455
[helicopter propellers
whirring]

03:41.489 --> 03:43.424
- You are like
Edward Scissorhands.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.793
[helicopter propellers
whirring]

03:45.826 --> 03:47.995
- Happy Thanksgiving,
everyone!

03:48.028 --> 03:49.730
- Sorry, we're the
last ones!

03:49.763 --> 03:52.600
Our Uber chopper
was late!

03:52.633 --> 03:53.834
- What can you do?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.803
Can I get the help?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.505
Thank you.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.442
- Happy Thanksgiving.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.544
- You too.
What happened?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.514
- Oh, uh.
Old vaulting injury.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.382
I sprained my ankle in the
Olympics ten years ago.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.683
- Really?

04:09.717 --> 04:12.620
- Nah, that was
Kerry Strug.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.554
I'm just too embarrassed
to tell you

04:13.587 --> 04:16.590
I slipped off a curb
while eating a donut

04:16.624 --> 04:18.058
and now this happens
sometimes.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.092
- Is it swollen?

04:19.126 --> 04:21.695
- I believe the proper
medical term is "cankle?"

04:21.729 --> 04:23.697
- Actually, it's
"peripheral edema."

04:23.731 --> 04:24.598
You need RICE.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.833
- Like pilaf?

04:25.866 --> 04:29.870
- No, RICE: Rest, Ice,
Compression, Elevation?

04:29.903 --> 04:31.639
- Wow, how do you
know that?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.841
- Um, I don't usually
tell people

04:33.874 --> 04:35.843
in the building this
but...

04:35.876 --> 04:37.044
[whispers]
I'm an ER doctor.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.879
- [whispers]
That's awesome.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.514
Why don't you want
people to know?

04:40.548 --> 04:43.517
- In med school, you hear
these urban legends.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.685
- If word gets out
you're a doctor,

04:44.718 --> 04:46.554
neighbors will stop by
day and night

04:46.587 --> 04:49.390
asking you to check
out their weird mole

04:49.423 --> 04:51.459
or prescribe Fentanyl.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.660
- Are you saying you
don't have any Fentanyl?

04:52.693 --> 04:54.094
Or that you won't
share it?

04:54.127 --> 04:57.898
- I know, it's silly,
but I've kept it quiet.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.667
Until now.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.535
- Well, I'm honored.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.070
- And if you need
anything for your ankle

05:03.103 --> 05:07.708
or whatever,
um, stop by.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.610
I'm 2F.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.481
- 2F.
Got that.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.684
- I think this cornucopia
from Ron Wendt

05:16.717 --> 05:18.719
will add the perfect
finishing touch.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.856
He's the florist
in New York City.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.692
- I actually
crafted my own.

05:24.725 --> 05:28.128
- I- I-
I see that.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.831
- But we'll put yours on
the kiddie table.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.633
- Great! Bringing
anything larger

05:32.666 --> 05:34.535
would have been gauche.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.437
- Jackie O said "gauche"
is a word reserved

05:36.470 --> 05:38.739
only for the bourgeois.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.607
- Well, she also said,

05:39.640 --> 05:41.909
"Let's ride with the
top down today."

05:44.478 --> 05:49.583
- Lex, so tell us, what is it
like to be a kept man?

05:49.617 --> 05:51.585
Does your wife keep your
balls in a Von Weber purse?

05:51.619 --> 05:53.954
Or just up on a high shelf
where you can't reach them?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.589
- Actually, Lex works
very hard--

05:55.623 --> 05:56.790
- Hey, it's okay, bro.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.660
Lockhart's just
yanking my chain,

05:59.693 --> 06:01.695
whatever that means.
- Yank, yank.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.896
- With Brooke doing
so well

06:02.930 --> 06:06.467
I can pursue my
passion, not just a job.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.135
I want to make more
than money,

06:08.168 --> 06:10.404
I want to make my mark.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.639
- How do you plan on
doing that?

06:11.672 --> 06:14.575
- I haven't figured
that out yet but

06:14.608 --> 06:17.511
as the CEO of L-E-X

06:17.545 --> 06:20.881
when the moment is
right, I'll know.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.149
- Well that's what
Hawthorn told himself

06:22.182 --> 06:23.751
20 years ago and
now look at him.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.719
[giggles]

06:29.457 --> 06:31.425
[knocking at door]

06:36.930 --> 06:39.533
- Hey!
- Hi!

06:39.567 --> 06:40.167
- Look at you!

06:40.200 --> 06:41.635
Two functioning cankles!

06:41.669 --> 06:43.471
- Yeah, thanks for
the advice.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.540
But that's not why
I came by.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.710
Could you take a look
at my girlfriend?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.512
She believes western
medicine is a tool

06:51.545 --> 06:52.546
of the patriarchy,

06:52.580 --> 06:53.847
but is having
chest pains

06:53.881 --> 06:56.450
and our doula is hosting
a vegan potluck.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.651
Would you mind?

06:57.685 --> 06:58.886
- Your girlfriend?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.988
Your super pregnant
girlfriend

07:01.021 --> 07:02.756
who thinks doctors
are the devil.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.493
- Yeah.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.326
- Have a seat.

07:06.359 --> 07:09.797
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

07:09.830 --> 07:13.701
- Easy babe.
Thank you so much.

07:16.737 --> 07:20.674
[text message pings]

07:20.708 --> 07:21.475
- Ooh, Jill.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.544
How about some
homemade hard cider?

07:23.577 --> 07:24.545
It's what the
Pilgrims drank

07:24.578 --> 07:25.546
at the very first
Thanksgiving.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.681
- Okay, there's also that nice
wine I brought.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.682
- There you go.
Mm.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.519
- Okay, I guess we're just
having this. Okay.

07:31.552 --> 07:35.723
- Yeah, right?
Life-changing.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.491
- Barrett is an
incredible chef.

07:37.525 --> 07:38.626
She is self taught,

07:38.659 --> 07:40.260
makes everything
from scratch,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.563
even wove these
place mats.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.864
- I can't wait to see
what you've done with

07:43.897 --> 07:46.534
the Heritage Turkey
that I sent.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.503
- I love me some turkey,
and stuffing, potatoes.

07:49.537 --> 07:53.574
Let a gravy tsunami
wash over me.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.944
- Brooke, I donated that
turkey to the soup kitchen.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.513
As I told you, we are
having a traditional

07:59.547 --> 08:00.848
Thanksgiving meal.

08:00.881 --> 08:04.284
There was no turkey
on the menu in 1621.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.719
- Oh? What was?

08:05.753 --> 08:07.087
- Eel and other
bottom feeders.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.724
Gourds and a mixed
grain gruel.

08:10.758 --> 08:11.992
Nothing like what
we eat today.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.027
- So, no turkey?

08:14.061 --> 08:16.630
- No turkey.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.998
- No stuffing?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.300
- No stuffing.

08:25.706 --> 08:25.973
[sloshing]

08:28.709 --> 08:30.077
- Barrett, can I help you
with that?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.178
- Oh no thanks, Jill.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.146
it takes a deft touch.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.282
- What do you need,
a churner's permit?

08:35.315 --> 08:36.216
- No.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.321
- Did the Pilgrims have
hor d'ouevres?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.592
[sloshing continues]

08:46.359 --> 08:49.663
[tense music]

08:49.697 --> 08:50.698
- Looking for something,
Jill?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.666
- Oh, uh, bathroom.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.934
- Oh it's this way.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.770
Twelfth door
on your right.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.674
- So I'm on
the 8th fairway,

09:00.708 --> 09:01.575
Pacific Ocean's
on my right,

09:01.609 --> 09:03.343
winds are swirling
around six knots.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.245
You guys know how the wind
swirls at Pebble Beach.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.080
I'm just gonna try to--

09:07.114 --> 09:08.616
just ever so gently,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.718
just...draw it in!

09:10.751 --> 09:13.754
Just chip it
and then fall.

09:13.787 --> 09:14.688
And then five feet
to the cup.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.989
So I'm doing this--

09:16.023 --> 09:16.757
- You and the kids should

09:16.790 --> 09:18.759
come into the city
some time.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.128
- Oh thanks.
It's just New York.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.597
The pollution,
the terrorism.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.232
- I assure you,
you are safe.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.001
- You and Lex are so brave
to be raising your kids there.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.070
- We're not brave,
it's--

09:30.103 --> 09:31.705
- I guess Lockhart and I
are fuddy-duddys

09:31.739 --> 09:33.707
about health
and safety.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.709
We should be more
like you and prioritize

09:35.743 --> 09:39.379
things like helipads, five star
restaurants, spas.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.014
99, 100.
- What are you--

09:41.048 --> 09:42.182
- Oh I'm so sorry.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.384
I do 100 kegels
every 100 minutes.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.185
My pelvic floor is

09:45.218 --> 09:46.987
the strongest muscle
in my body.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.722
- Is it?
- I am my own forceps.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.357
- Uh-huh.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.263
- Oh Jill, those are
decorative walnuts.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.667
- Really?
They look so real.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.734
They're fake?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.770
- No, they're real.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.042
- Yummy.
You look good.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.214
- I'm gonna go check
on Andy.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.051
- Like, I took
the right line.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.353
I took the right line
on 17 it drops.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.355
I'm on the wrong half
of the hourglass green.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.357
At any rate, it's a
40-foot putt.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.192
Who sinks it?

10:25.225 --> 10:26.293
- [deep sigh]

10:26.326 --> 10:27.260
- This guy.
I sunk it.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.328
Like it was nothing.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.133
- Probably just heartburn.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.768
If you have antacid,
that might help.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.336
- Oh thanks, but Tammy
thinks Big Pharma

10:36.369 --> 10:39.039
is the nadir of the medical-
industrial complex.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.041
- Of course she does.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.409
I have some shredded
potato peels in the sink

10:42.442 --> 10:44.111
if she'd like to gnaw
on those.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.278
- Does that
help heartburn?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.280
- No.
- Of course not.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.183
We've got some
ginger root at home.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.220
Thanks for everything.

10:53.821 --> 11:00.260
[funky music]

11:02.830 --> 11:06.700
- 5C told me you're
a doctor.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.467
I have an abscess

11:07.500 --> 11:09.169
and I think it
might be leeching.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.072
Can you take
a look?

11:12.105 --> 11:13.373
- Come in.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.179
- As our ancestors did on
the first Thanksgiving,

11:19.212 --> 11:21.114
let us join hands.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.286
Lockhart, will you
do the honors?

11:26.319 --> 11:27.420
- Of course.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.125
Bow your heads.

11:34.762 --> 11:40.467
* We thank thee
for this daily bread *

11:40.500 --> 11:46.339
* For blessings on
this table spread *

11:46.373 --> 11:55.215
* Our Lord in heaven

11:55.248 --> 12:01.822
[All sing together]
* Amen

12:01.855 --> 12:03.857
- It was beautiful.
- Goosebumps.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.525
- Thank you.
- Gorgeous.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.795
- Now, let us enjoy
a delicious

12:07.828 --> 12:11.231
and historically accurate
Thanksgiving feast.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.366
- Been looking forward
to this all day.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.836
- The harvest
of my labors.

12:15.869 --> 12:21.541
- Ahh?!
I'm sorry, just surprised.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.543
- 12 o'clock
smoked eel,

12:23.576 --> 12:25.846
2 o'clock raw
Atlantic Oysters,

12:25.879 --> 12:29.249
6:45 a lukewarm,
milk and corn samp,

12:29.282 --> 12:31.284
9 o'clock
lobster body.

12:31.318 --> 12:34.187
- There's no tails
or claws or--

12:34.221 --> 12:37.925
- Enjoy everyone!

12:37.958 --> 12:40.293
- Oh.
- Oh honey, oh.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.262
- I just died.
- Get the recipe.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.431
- The samp has a
complex mouth feel.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.265
- The way she
described it,

12:45.298 --> 12:46.934
I thought it would
taste like barf.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.903
- Well, I finish whatever
you don't have.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.304
- I think it's wonderful
we've been blessed

12:51.338 --> 12:52.806
with a white
Thanksgiving.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.908
- The whitest.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.443
- Jill, what do you
do on Thanksgiving?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.912
Do you have any
Jewish traditions?

12:58.946 --> 13:02.015
- Um, well I'm American
so, no.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.517
We usually we go to my
mother-in-law, Candace's

13:04.551 --> 13:09.389
but she's sequestered
on that Cruise Murder jury.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.958
- Really? I love
that trial.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.926
- Me too.
I am obsessed.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.194
- I'm obsessed.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.562
- The wife so
pushed him overboard.

13:15.595 --> 13:16.329
- Yes!

13:16.363 --> 13:17.597
- I mean,
she's totally guilty.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.531
- Totally!

13:18.565 --> 13:20.333
- Did you know that
he filed for divorce

13:20.367 --> 13:22.269
two weeks before
the cruise?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.603
- Yes Brooke, we all
watch Dateline.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.339
- Everyone, in the world.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.308
- We do have one
family tradition.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.209
We go around the table

13:29.242 --> 13:31.011
and say something
we're thankful for.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.880
- Oh fun idea, Jill.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.314
I'd like to improve on it.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.249
Let's each say
one thing

13:36.283 --> 13:39.586
someone else should
be thankful for.

13:39.619 --> 13:43.423
Okay, I'll go first.
Hm.

13:43.456 --> 13:48.361
Brooke, I think you
should be thankful...

13:48.395 --> 13:51.531
Lex didn't get
indicted.

13:51.564 --> 13:52.900
- We have many
blessings

13:52.933 --> 13:53.967
to count this year.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.402
Millions, in fact!

13:55.435 --> 13:58.972
- Not as many millions
as last year,

13:59.006 --> 14:01.408
but Brooke, I recently read
an article saying that

14:01.441 --> 14:03.376
losing money can
actually be a relief

14:03.410 --> 14:05.979
because once you fall so far
behind the Joneses,

14:06.013 --> 14:06.980
you're free
from the pressure

14:07.014 --> 14:08.515
of having to keep
up with them.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.284
- Yeah see? Something to be
thankful for, right Lex?

14:15.555 --> 14:16.523
- Oh my God.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.525
Brooke's the nice one.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.366
- Our ancestors were
the first to colonize

14:27.935 --> 14:29.937
the final frontier!

14:29.970 --> 14:32.172
No one was here when they
settled these rich lands.

14:32.205 --> 14:36.977
No one!
Aboard their ship,

14:37.010 --> 14:39.179
they careened toward
a New World.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.513
Alien to its terrain,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.449
strangers to
a strange land,

14:42.482 --> 14:45.418
they changed the
course of human history.

14:48.088 --> 14:51.458
- He's not done.
I don't think he's done.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.961
- Yes they did!

14:53.994 --> 14:57.464
I am sorry for the unexpected
intermission everyone

14:57.497 --> 15:01.234
but I finally figured out
what I am going to do next.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.135
- I bet it's an app.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.204
- No, running for office.
Guaranteed.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.007
- I'm going to Mars!

15:07.040 --> 15:10.043
[children giggle]

15:10.077 --> 15:11.211
- We were way off.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.346
- Light years.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.282
- Children, why don't you
take five?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.484
Uncle Lex is gonna do
a little show of his own

15:17.517 --> 15:19.419
and then you can
come back and finish.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.220
- I don't know
what that play

15:20.253 --> 15:22.289
had to do with
Thanksgiving, buddy

15:22.322 --> 15:26.026
but it really spoke to me.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.528
- So, Lex.
I mean, do tell.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.999
How did you land on Mars?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.534
- I didn't land on Mars,
Barrett.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.237
Mars landed on me.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.372
It's the hottest game in
town right now

15:39.406 --> 15:42.242
and I want
a front row seat.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.111
I found my
calling in life.

15:44.144 --> 15:48.215
I am a Space Pilgrim.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.116
- What about you, Brooke?

15:49.149 --> 15:54.221
How do you feel about
Lex going to Mars?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.356
- Of course, I think
it's great.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.226
After global domination
the only place left

15:59.259 --> 16:02.162
for the von Webers
to go is intergalactic.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.231
Am I right?

16:06.166 --> 16:09.036
Lex, I support you
in your dream

16:09.069 --> 16:12.205
just as you supported
me in mine.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.540
- I love you, babe.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.575
- Love you.

16:15.608 --> 16:19.479
- Aw cute! I'm so happy
for you guys.

16:19.512 --> 16:23.416
But I hope they don't
have secretaries in space.

16:23.450 --> 16:27.454
- Dessert! What did the
Pilgrims have for dessert?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.323
- Raisins?! Why does Barrett
hate Thanksgiving?

16:30.357 --> 16:33.426
- I don't know, honey.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.428
- I told you not to
worry about me.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.664
- Yep. Definitely not
worried now.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.600
Lex, are you sure
you're feeling okay?

16:40.633 --> 16:43.136
- I have never
felt better.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.537
Not even when I was
at night three

16:44.571 --> 16:47.074
of Phish at
Red Rocks.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.443
- It's an allergic reaction.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.644
- But my nephrologist said--

16:51.678 --> 16:53.680
[phone rings]
- Hold on. Jill?

16:53.713 --> 16:56.316
- Ollie's party sounds
like so much fun.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.586
Tell me everything you're
eating and go slow.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.388
- Oh, I'm not at Ollie's.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.590
That sound is the
din of all of my neighbors

17:03.623 --> 17:05.292
inside my apartment
at once.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.459
- Wait, you're doing
Thanksgiving

17:06.493 --> 17:07.494
with your neighbors?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.329
- Mm-hm. Apparently.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.598
Look, I gotta go suture a
fistula. Don't ask.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.066
When are you back?

17:13.100 --> 17:14.167
- It's snowing here
but nothing

17:14.201 --> 17:15.302
will prevent me
from escaping

17:15.335 --> 17:18.238
this hell hole tonight.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.207
- This is the worst
Thanksgiving ever.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.474
Can we please do
dinner tomorrow?

17:21.508 --> 17:24.111
Turkey, stuffing, gravy.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.312
So much gravy.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.514
- Yes! Yes! A thousand
times yes!

17:27.547 --> 17:28.415
- Are you okay?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.083
You usually only go
Pride & Prejudice

17:30.117 --> 17:31.151
when you're really
losing it.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.619
- Oh you have no idea.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.721
How could you
let me come here?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.289
[painful moaning]

17:36.323 --> 17:38.491
- I gotta go.
See you tomorrow!

17:41.561 --> 17:45.198
- 41, 42.
I'm doing my kegels.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.734
- Oh, you can sit--
All right.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.304
- Sisterhood isn't always
easy, but

17:51.338 --> 17:54.707
it is for always.
Happy Thanksgiving.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.278
These bags won't
be in stores for a month

17:58.311 --> 18:00.647
and I want you guys to
have the first ones.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.482
- Thank you, Brooke.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.251
- Barrett, this reminds me.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.253
You have not shown me
your new Tory Burch.

18:06.286 --> 18:06.719
- What?!

18:06.753 --> 18:07.587
- You haven't.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.655
- Okay, you know that
I have a closet

18:08.688 --> 18:10.390
with my enitre collection.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.491
I put this one
on a pedestal.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.058
- [gasps]

18:12.091 --> 18:13.426
- It is breath-taking.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.696
- Okay, I am the
founder and She-E-O

18:16.729 --> 18:18.765
of one of the fastest
growing retail brands

18:18.798 --> 18:20.233
in the country!

18:20.267 --> 18:21.234
- Cul de Sac.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.735
- Well aren't you impressed
with yourself?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.205
I mean, it's not like
you're Louis Vuitton,

18:25.238 --> 18:28.441
getting knocked off and sold
on every street corner.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.178
I mean, hardly.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.280
- Every BBQ or block
party there's a version of

18:33.313 --> 18:34.614
Barrett's potato salad.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.449
Everyone tries to
recreate it,

18:36.483 --> 18:38.385
nothing competes
with the original.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.453
- The secret is I make my
own mayonnaise.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.190
- Barrett makes her own
mayonnaise.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.458
- Ugh! Barrett! Barrett!
Barrett!

18:45.492 --> 18:50.463
[mid-tempo music]

18:52.765 --> 18:55.202
- Ah, this...is stunning!

18:55.235 --> 18:56.236
- Oh it is.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.304
- Oh my gosh, I could do a
really great bath mat.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.672
- Or a pillow. Put it in
and then close the top.

19:01.874 --> 19:02.209
[somber music]

19:04.877 --> 19:07.747
- Brooke?
Are you o-- cake!

19:12.319 --> 19:17.224
So good.
So good.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.625
Brooke, I know it's hard.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.760
- Oh, don't look at me.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.362
- Don't let them
get to you.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.231
They're blonde,
jealous turds.

19:24.264 --> 19:28.435
They hate ya'
because they ain't ya!

19:28.468 --> 19:30.803
- Do you think Barrett
ships her cakes?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.372
- They're not jealous.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.974
They love flaunting their
perfect lives.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.809
Their kids aren't
hell cats.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.213
Their Olympic medals
aren't for participation.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.915
- Your kids are
pooped from angels.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.285
And Hawthorne might
not cheat,

19:45.318 --> 19:46.919
but Lockhart
definitely knows

19:46.953 --> 19:49.188
what a dick tastes like.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.992
It's a gut instinct.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.828
- Even though your people
came through Ellis Island,

19:55.862 --> 19:58.765
you're more my family
than they are.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.435
- Brooke, family--
[gagging]

20:02.469 --> 20:05.338
- Jill, are you--

20:05.372 --> 20:06.239
- [shrieks]
That's the cake

20:06.273 --> 20:09.942
for my gender reveal
party! Oh my God!

20:16.549 --> 20:20.420
- [heavy breathing]

20:20.453 --> 20:24.491
It's a girl!

20:24.524 --> 20:30.029
- [crying]
No!

20:30.062 --> 20:33.933
- Oh...my...God!

20:33.966 --> 20:39.272
- [sobbing]
Why?

20:39.306 --> 20:44.777
- I was wrong about
the suburbs.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.379
It's not a house
of horrors,

20:46.413 --> 20:49.015
it's a house of snores.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.351
- [snoring]

20:51.384 --> 20:53.920
Jill: There's no darkness.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.423
No secrets.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.726
[ominous tones]

20:59.759 --> 21:01.494
Jill: Just banality.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.035
Promise we never have to
go back there again?

21:09.068 --> 21:12.505
- I promise.

21:12.539 --> 21:17.777
[suspenseful tones]

21:17.810 --> 21:20.012
[door creaks]

21:20.046 --> 21:21.348
[ominous tones crescendo]

21:21.381 --> 21:23.816
[chains rattle]

21:23.850 --> 21:24.551
