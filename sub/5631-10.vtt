male announcer:
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.776 --> 00:12.012
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.348
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.348 --> 00:16.317
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.317 --> 00:17.918
are members of an elite squad

00:17.918 --> 00:19.687
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.889
These are their stories.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.163
- Well, thank you so much
for meeting me for lunch.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.599
I've been going stir-crazy
on maternity leave.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.801
- How's being a mom?
- You were right.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.503
It's the greatest
thing ever.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.138
- See, I told you.
- Yeah.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.140
- You getting any sleep?
- No! Look at me.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.574
I was up till 4:00 a.m.
last night.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.842
- What is she, six weeks?
- Mm.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.077
- You gotta Ferberize
her soon.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.012
No, really, listen.
You gotta call my sister.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.081
It's like two or three nights
where the baby

00:47.081 --> 00:48.716
basically cries non-stop.
- Yeah.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.351
- But then they start
to self-soothe.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.719
- Okay, then you
come over and do it.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.554
[baby cries]
Oh, see?

00:53.554 --> 00:55.089
Here we go.
- No, I got this, I got this.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.257
- I--it's okay.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.791
- Hey, hey, come on.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.261
Come on,
that's a good girl, Jesse.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.930
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Shh.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.966
You see? The secret is, you
gotta bounce from your knees.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.335
They love that.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.537
[baby coos]
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

01:09.537 --> 01:12.673
shh, shh, shh...

01:12.673 --> 01:15.609
[woman moaning]

01:15.609 --> 01:21.149
Ah...ah...ahh!

01:21.149 --> 01:25.686
[woman laughs]

01:27.588 --> 01:29.423
- [chuckling]

01:31.159 --> 01:33.294
- Hurry up, Travis.
You don't want to be late.

01:33.294 --> 01:36.497
- Can you, uh,
write me a note?

01:36.497 --> 01:37.998
- [laughs]

01:41.835 --> 01:44.071
[school bell rings]

01:46.039 --> 01:48.041
- You missed lunch.
Saved you some.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.843
- No need.
I already ate out.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.216
What're you smiling at,
Zach?

01:55.216 --> 01:57.017
- Oh, nothing.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.319
- Travis, Jordan.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.020
There's still two more
hours till winter break.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.790
- Yeah, get to class,
or you're benched.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.025
Zach,
I expect more from you

02:05.025 --> 02:07.295
if you're gonna earn a slot.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.829
- Towel boy's never
getting a slot.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.498
On any team.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.068
- Oscar Wilde was a man
of many secrets,

02:15.068 --> 02:17.571
and those secrets
influenced his writing.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.940
So you're going to finish
"The Picture of Dorian Gray"

02:19.940 --> 02:21.975
for your first quiz
back in January.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.311
[school bell rings]

02:23.311 --> 02:24.978
Now, I know
you'll be on vacation,

02:24.978 --> 02:27.080
but I expect a report of
a novel of your choice

02:27.080 --> 02:29.116
from each of you
when you get back.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.384
Happy holidays.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.220
See you.
Bye, Becka.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.855
Have fun on the slopes.
Happy holidays.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.224
Hey, see you, Anna.
Have fun.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.591
Be safe.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.826
Happy winter break, boys.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.228
- Have a good vacation,
Ms. Burnap.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.696
- Oh, I will.
Oh, Jordan.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.266
Before you go,
can I get a little help?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.600
- Now?

02:46.600 --> 02:49.970
- Well, I need a ream of paper
from the supply closet,

02:49.970 --> 02:52.139
and it's on a high shelf.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.807
- Yeah.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.417
[both breathing hard]

03:08.422 --> 03:10.258
- Stop, stop.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.263
- Playing hard to get?

03:15.263 --> 03:17.164
Is that better?

03:17.164 --> 03:20.634
Now let's see what we can
do to get that average up.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.771

[chiming]

03:45.293 --> 03:48.161
- Dad? It's me.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.732
Look, Mom's on the warpath
about your girlfriend again.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.434
So it might be
a better holiday

03:53.434 --> 03:55.869
if you just
ignore her when she calls.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.539
Talk to you later.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.913

[thud]

04:38.178 --> 04:40.748
- You lost?
- What?

04:40.748 --> 04:41.949
Uh, no.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.384
Just waiting
for a friend.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.018
- Call him.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.088
Kids come here to buy drugs
sometimes and end up in jail.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.458
Safe home.

05:50.451 --> 05:50.584
.

05:51.485 --> 05:51.919
- Performance reviews?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.121
Okay.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.923
- It's just part of my
duties as sergeant.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.324
We've been running up
overtime.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.259
I think we can work
more efficiently.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.894
- And you have some
ideas about that?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.496
- Yeah. Take Carisi.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.432
He's studying for
the bar, trailing Barba.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.133
I'm not so sure
his focus is here.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.636
- He's learning the law.
He's becoming a better cop.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.804
- And Rollins--
is she really coming back?

06:10.804 --> 06:13.441
I mean, we both saw her
with her baby.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.242
Seems like motherhood
is her priority.

06:15.242 --> 06:18.646
- You can be a good mother and
good at your job, too, Dodds.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.214
- Of course.
It's just, uh...

06:21.214 --> 06:23.451
I think you need someone here
who's all about the job.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.152
- I've got you
and I've got Fin.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.020
- Me? I'm still getting
up to speed.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.922
And Fin--
- Don't underestimate him.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.724
He knows more
than anyone here.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.993
- He does.
It's just that...

06:32.993 --> 06:34.462
He's a kicker.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.697
He boots any call he can
to someone else.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.698
- That's not true.

06:37.698 --> 06:38.732
[knocking at door]

06:38.732 --> 06:40.367
- Sorry to interrupt.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.302
We got a call about
a missing 15-year-old boy.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.538
- For how long?
- Over 48 hours.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.507
Their local precinct wants us
to take a look at it.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.308
- Okay.
Better safe than sorry.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.577
- That's why I figured
Sarge and Carisi

06:49.577 --> 06:52.279
might want to check it out.
- Uh, why not you?

06:52.279 --> 06:55.949
- Well, I've been racking up
a lot of overtime lately, so...

06:55.949 --> 06:57.284
- Yeah, well,
I'll approve it.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.986
Go with Dodds.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.561
- Zach told me he went skiing.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.229
Cole has a timeshare
in Vail.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.964
He's always buying
the kid's love.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.501
- Cole is Zach's dad?
- Yes, we're divorced.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.503
Zach said his father
bought him a ticket,

07:15.503 --> 07:16.970
but he never texted me
when he landed.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.405
Then Cole
didn't answer my calls.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.073
- So Cole had no contact
with Zach, either?

07:20.073 --> 07:22.510
- No. When he finally
answered his cell,

07:22.510 --> 07:24.144
he said he'd just flown in
on a red-eye

07:24.144 --> 07:25.513
with his girlfriend.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.515
He's a pilot, she's his
third flight attendant.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.283
- Did you see Zach leave?
Did he pack a bag?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.786
- His duffel bag is gone.
And his toothbrush.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.188
- Did he have
a laptop or an iPad?

07:35.188 --> 07:36.890
- It would be on his desk.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.258
- It's not here.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.193
- Why are you bombarding me
with questions?

07:40.193 --> 07:42.996
Shouldn't you be checking
every hospital, every morgue?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.665
- We're getting
to that, ma'am.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.668
- Don't patronize me.
That is what Cole does.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.102
He thinks I'm overreacting.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.337
- You are.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.072
- Oh, now you get here!

07:52.072 --> 07:53.641
- This is ridiculous,
Serena.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.242
Why would I take Zach
over Christmas?

07:55.242 --> 07:56.910
It's the busiest travel
time of the year.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.411
- You took him
last year!

07:58.411 --> 08:00.548
Oh, wait, before you
had the girlfriend.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.782
- Seriously?

08:01.782 --> 08:03.884
- Mr. and Mrs. Foster,
your son is missing.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.318
- Right. Sorry.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.154
- We'll take all the information
that you can give us.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.557
We'll try and track
his cell phone.

08:09.557 --> 08:12.192
- I already tried.
I have a locator on it.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.027
His phone's either off
or it's dead.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.997
- You track his phone?
- We share a cloud ID.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.266
- You can check
his messages?

08:19.266 --> 08:21.602
- Oh, right, yeah.
I can.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.672
Um, I set it up when I bought
the phone for safety.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.239
- You had that
and you didn't check?

08:26.239 --> 08:28.576
- I turned off the
notifications like a year ago.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.679
You have any idea
how many texts kids send?

08:31.679 --> 08:34.481
Okay. There's, like,
dozens of them here.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.283
Um...

08:36.283 --> 08:37.785
What's this?

08:37.785 --> 08:39.953
Looks like he's sexting
a girl.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.589
- That's more
like a woman.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.791
- "I'll teach you
so many things.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.793
You'll be
my favorite student."

08:45.793 --> 08:47.027
- Ugh.
So what is this--

08:47.027 --> 08:48.629
some woman took my son?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.898
- May I see that a minute?

08:50.898 --> 08:53.366
"Take the LIRR
to Jamaica Station.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.636
"Meet me at the base of
the AirTrain entrance.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.038
Bring your passport.
Let's fly away."

08:58.038 --> 08:59.640
- Well... [laughs]

08:59.640 --> 09:01.308
He must've gone willingly.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.011
I mean, look at her.
- It doesn't matter.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.446
He's 15.
She's not.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.949
[ominous music]

09:08.949 --> 09:10.517
- The last texts are about
going to the AirTrain.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.519
Others were more explicit,
accompanied by pictures.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.987
- And we tracked
Zach's phone?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.522
- Yeah, it died at
Jamaica Station.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.024
- And I traced the cell
the pics came from.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.391
It's a burner.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.993
It only sent texts to Zach,
then it goes off the grid.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.729
But I'm still going
through the older texts.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.030
- Whoever this woman is,

09:23.030 --> 09:24.231
she knew exactly
what she was doing.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.432
- Never shows her face.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.067
No identifying
marks or tattoos.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.368
- The texts indicate
that she's older,

09:28.368 --> 09:29.870
that she knew him
from school.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.939
It's gotta be a teacher
from River Park Charter High.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.406
- Okay.
We flag his passport?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.676
- First thing.
Then I checked TSA.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.645
Zach never made it
to the airport.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.146
- So talk to MTA,

09:39.146 --> 09:42.816
see if we can get security
footage from Jamaica Station.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.117
Anything else?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.552
- Yeah.
In an earlier text,

09:45.552 --> 09:47.688
she mentions
the names Travis and Jordan.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.256
Says that if Zach
wants extra credit,

09:49.256 --> 09:50.658
he should ask them about it.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.892
- Okay, so classmates.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.026
Track them down.
- Won't be easy.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.328
School's closed
for winter break.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.230
- Somebody's gotta be around.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.700
Start with the principal.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.505
[knocking on door]

10:05.505 --> 10:06.907
- My father would have a cow

10:06.907 --> 10:09.677
if he saw Santa sagging
on his lawn like that.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.712
- Try knocking again.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.115
- Okay, okay, I'm coming.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.351
[rock music in background]
How much I owe you?

10:18.351 --> 10:20.120
- Actually, we're NYPD.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.756
- Oh, that's how
I know you guys.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.191
- Are you Mr. Bernstein?

10:24.191 --> 10:25.993
Principal of River Park
Charter High School?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.627
- Yeah,
but I'm on vacation.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.596
Why don't you go call
the pizza place,

10:29.596 --> 10:31.164
see what's taking so long?

10:32.700 --> 10:34.668
I'm kind of busy right now.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.003
Can it wait?
- Afraid not.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.105
We're searching for
a missing student.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.807
Zach Foster.
- Zach?

10:39.807 --> 10:41.141
He's a good kid.
Is he in trouble?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.609
- Well, we're not sure.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.411
We got reason to believe
he's with this woman.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.379
You have any teachers
who look like that?

10:46.379 --> 10:48.882
- There's been a lot of turnover
in education the last few years.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.251
Most of my teachers are young.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.953
So let's rule out
the older ones, the men,

10:52.953 --> 10:54.054
anybody 50 pounds heavier.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.588
We'll start from there.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.958
- She may already be involved
with two other students.

10:57.958 --> 11:01.061
She told Zach to talk
to Travis and Jordan.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.329
- No last names?
- Mmm.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.798
- [sighs]
Travis and Jordan...

11:04.798 --> 11:06.299
There's a few of each,

11:06.299 --> 11:09.169
but, uh, maybe Travis Barstow
and Jordan Massina?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.738
They're both on
the wrestling team.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.774
Zach's the equipment manager.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.643
- I don't know who that is.

11:16.643 --> 11:19.346
- She told Zach Foster
to ask you about extra credit.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.647
- Zach?
No way.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.750
- Well, he's missing,
maybe with her,

11:22.750 --> 11:24.051
and he could be
in danger.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.385
- Yeah, in danger
of getting laid.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.754
- This is no joke.

11:26.754 --> 11:27.888
You cover for her,

11:27.888 --> 11:29.823
you're an accessory
to statutory rape.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.059
- Look, we have the sexts,

11:32.059 --> 11:34.527
and we think that she
sent the same ones to Zach

11:34.527 --> 11:35.896
that she sent to you.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.264
- Zach's still waiting
on puberty.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.766
She wouldn't go for him.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.101
He's dreaming.
She likes guys with muscle.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.770
- Like you?

11:42.770 --> 11:44.604
- It's not like that.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.639
- Well,
what's it like, then?

11:48.776 --> 11:51.611
- I didn't want to.
I had to.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.080
My grades were slipping.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.049
I would have gotten kicked
off the wrestling team.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.452
- Who is she?

11:59.452 --> 12:01.855
- Ms. Burnap.

12:01.855 --> 12:05.525
Phoebe's her first name.
She's our English teacher.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.461
She makes me do things
to her in the supply closet.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.797
That's how I got
the perfect grade

12:09.797 --> 12:12.432
on my
"Leaves of Grass" essay.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.467
- Phoebe Burnap, 27.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.970
She's been at River Park
for the last year and a half.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.372
But before that,
three different schools...

12:19.372 --> 12:20.540
four years.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.943
- Fired?
- No, she quit each time.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.544
But when I called
former administrators,

12:24.544 --> 12:26.213
two admitted
that they'd heard rumors.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.480
- And they did nothing?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.116
- They said rumors always follow
young, pretty teachers.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.483
Boys talk.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.052
- Hot for teacher.
Happens everywhere.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.954
- Right, but when
the teacher follows through--

12:33.954 --> 12:35.555
- That's rape.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.690
- Jordan and Travis confirmed
that the sexts came from her.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.692
- But why would she
use her own cell on them

12:39.692 --> 12:40.727
and a burner on Zach?

12:40.727 --> 12:41.829
I mean,
why the change in pattern?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.463
- Maybe she's learning.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.732
Or she wants to take it
to the next level with Zach.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.134
- Either way,
we know who he's with.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.335
The question is,
where are they?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.669
- Well,
last known whereabouts

12:49.669 --> 12:53.841
got him heading east from
Jamaica Station Friday night.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.408
- So widen the scope.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.044
See if the teacher turns up

12:57.044 --> 12:59.246
on any security cameras
outside the station.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.581
Start a canvass.
- No need to.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.850
I ran her credit cards.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.717
She put a deposit down
on a Vermont ski lodge,

13:04.717 --> 13:06.887
and she bought gas up
near there Saturday morning.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.856
- How far north?

13:08.856 --> 13:11.224
[suspenseful music]

13:11.224 --> 13:13.560
- Front desk confirms
Phoebe Burnap's in room 212

13:13.560 --> 13:14.594
with a young male.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.863
- Great. Let's move.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.698
- They request
that we spare the door.

13:18.698 --> 13:26.673
*

13:30.878 --> 13:35.782
[woman moaning]

13:37.918 --> 13:39.786
- NYPD. Nobody move.
- What the hell?

13:39.786 --> 13:41.388
- What's going on?
- Get out!

13:41.388 --> 13:43.223
- Where's Zach?
- Wh--who?

13:43.223 --> 13:45.792
- How old are you?
- He's 21--he's my husband.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.127
- Your husband?

13:47.127 --> 13:48.929
- Yes. We eloped
Friday night.

13:48.929 --> 13:53.466
- All right, how about we lose
the cuffs, get dressed.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.603
Phoebe Burnap,
you're under arrest.

14:01.942 --> 14:02.075
.

14:02.976 --> 14:03.310
- That's you.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.013
We got confirmation

14:06.013 --> 14:09.282
from the two other boys
you sexted.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.650
- That's my picture, yes,

14:10.650 --> 14:13.053
but I don't know
where Zach got it.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.621
Check my phone;
they didn't come from me.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.156
We know they came
from a burner cell.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.391
- I'm not even
sure what that is.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.726
- Listen, if you met
up with Zach Foster,

14:19.726 --> 14:20.961
you need to tell us now.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.762
We're pulling the video
from the AirTrain entrance

14:22.762 --> 14:24.297
and we're gonna put
the two of you together.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.733
- I wasn't with Zach.
Honestly, he's just a kid.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.701
- Oh, not your type?

14:30.270 --> 14:31.738
- Come on, Phoebe.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.041
Your picture's on his phone.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.143
You asked him to meet you.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.710
Where is he?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.579
- I don't know.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.549
My husband, David, is on
Christmas break from Oberlin.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.784
We decided to elope
the night he came back.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.419
That's why
we were in Vermont.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.820
We've been together
the whole time.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.457
- Okay, well, you
stick to that story,

14:50.457 --> 14:53.426
and you're gonna end up
in jail and on the registry

14:53.426 --> 14:54.627
for a very long time.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.063
Is that what you want?

14:56.063 --> 14:57.564
- I want a lawyer.
- Fine.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.133
But the longer it takes us
to find Zach,

15:00.133 --> 15:03.036
the less likely you are
to get a deal.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.504
If something
happens to Zach--

15:04.504 --> 15:07.574
- I didn't do anything.
I want a lawyer.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.811
- Someone must've hacked
Phoebe's phone.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.513
These are pictures
she sent to me.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.982
- Not just you.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.650
Three of her students --
Travis, Jordan, and Zach.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.851
- She would never do that.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.320
- I know this must
be hard for you,

15:20.320 --> 15:22.255
but you understand our
perspective here, right?

15:22.255 --> 15:23.823
I mean, these photos,

15:23.823 --> 15:26.226
the information
from the boys...

15:26.226 --> 15:28.628
How long have you
known your...wife?

15:28.628 --> 15:29.629
- We've known each other

15:29.629 --> 15:30.630
for years.
- For years?

15:30.630 --> 15:31.831
You're 21.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.166
- Yeah,
we met in high school.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.734
Senior year.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.036
- Your senior year?

15:36.036 --> 15:38.405
- Well, yeah.
Her first year teaching.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.176
Six years
is not a big difference.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.713
If she were 21 and I was 27,
it'd be fine, right?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.015
- We're not here
to judge you.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.582
We just need to know

15:49.582 --> 15:51.718
when and where
you met Phoebe on Friday.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.289
- She picked me up at
LaGuardia a little after 3:00.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.857
We drove up to the ski lodge

15:57.857 --> 16:00.727
and got married at the base
of the mountain at midnight

16:00.727 --> 16:03.163
as snow fell all around us.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.365
- "As the snow fell."
Romantic.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.866
- Yeah, it was.

16:06.866 --> 16:09.869
We were together
the whole time.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.339
She wore me out.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.508
- He could be lying,
but I doubt it.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.809
- That kid's in love.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.345
You can't trust
someone like that.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.580
- Okay, the lodge confirms
their check-in time,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.349
champagne delivery
to the room,

16:22.349 --> 16:24.117
and a couple's massage.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.785
- It could be
some elaborate alibi,

16:25.785 --> 16:27.454
but what was her plan?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.122
Take a 15-year-old
on her honeymoon?

16:29.122 --> 16:30.723
- She text Zach,
sent him tickets.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.392
There's gotta be some
connection between them.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.061
- The first two boys
are athletes.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.296
She sexted them
from her regular cell,

16:36.296 --> 16:37.864
did them in her car
or in her school.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.066
It's a long throw from that

16:39.066 --> 16:40.667
to a burner cell
and kidnapping.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.535
- It is, but she is
Zach's last contact.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.137
So this David
knows something.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.905
Keep him talking.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.240
[knock at door]

16:47.240 --> 16:49.542
Lieutenant Benson?
- Counselor Roth.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.079
- On what charges are you
holding Phoebe Burnap?

16:52.079 --> 16:54.214
- Rape in the third,
possibly rape in the second,

16:54.214 --> 16:55.582
kidnapping,
and sexual assault.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.150
- Rape?

16:57.150 --> 16:59.986
A jury is going to look
at her, look at him...

16:59.986 --> 17:02.489
Do you think
they'll see it that way?

17:02.489 --> 17:04.557
My client and I
will need a word.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.527
- Of course.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.797
[door thuds shut]

17:10.797 --> 17:12.532
Look, we can't
prove she took Zach,

17:12.532 --> 17:14.101
but we have her
dead to rights

17:14.101 --> 17:15.735
on raping
two other teenaged boys.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.804
- I'm aware.
But right now, Zach is missing,

17:17.804 --> 17:19.272
and he's the priority.

17:19.272 --> 17:22.175
If she wants a deal,
she'll get one.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.510
- Zach is a nice kid.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.977
I would never do
anything to hurt him.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.679
- Well, then tell us
where he is.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.281
- I'd first like
to make it clear

17:28.281 --> 17:30.250
that my client
is admitting to nothing.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.452
And, unless we get
a proffer agreement,

17:32.452 --> 17:33.820
we're walking out
the door.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.288
- You want queen for a day,
you've got it.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.923
We don't have time to
hammer out the logistics now,

17:36.923 --> 17:38.858
but I'll work with you to
see that your client gets

17:38.858 --> 17:41.128
a better deal than she deserves
for raping two students.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.662
- Rape?
That's not--

17:42.662 --> 17:45.132
- Ms. Burnap, we're only
discussing Zach right now.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.634
- But--
- Our concern is finding him.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.770
- I never approached Zach.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.639
I never texted him.
He's a good student.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.707
There was never
any need for tutoring.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.309
- Tutoring--is that
what you're calling it?

17:56.309 --> 17:57.810
- I was looking out
for those kids.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.547
- Yeah?
In the supply closet?

18:00.547 --> 18:03.049
- Jordan and Travis come from
dysfunctional homes.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.685
There were abuse issues.
I helped them through it.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.720
- Again,
let's focus on Zach.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.921
- Quickly.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.592
- Okay.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.628
My client was set up by
someone, and we know who.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.532
- Hold on--
you know who Zach's with

18:19.532 --> 18:21.468
and you've waited
all this time to tell us?

18:21.468 --> 18:25.272
- Let's not waste any more
of it with recriminations.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.439
Ms. Burnap?

18:28.175 --> 18:31.077
- Jordan came to me
a month ago, upset.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.912
He was having a hard time
performing.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.046
He was feeling inadequate.

18:34.046 --> 18:37.517
I...reassured him
that he wasn't,

18:37.517 --> 18:39.619
but he told me that
he already talked about it

18:39.619 --> 18:42.722
with Donald Basinski,
his wrestling coach.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.225
[ominous music]

18:45.225 --> 18:48.761
- This Coach Basinski
knew about you and Jordan?

18:48.761 --> 18:49.929
- So you see,

18:49.929 --> 18:51.564
Ms. Burnap
is a victim here, too.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.200
- A victim?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.801
- Those photos
were personal.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.403
If Basinski used them, it was
without my permission.

18:56.403 --> 18:59.672
- Used them, how?

18:59.672 --> 19:01.841
To lure Zach to him?

19:01.841 --> 19:04.211
- He is a wrestling coach.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.446
You hear a lot of rumors
about those guys.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.914
- Yeah, okay.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.982
I showed Coach Basinski
the sexts and the photos.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.418
He said he'd put
an end to it.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.386
- He didn't want you to go to
the principal or the police?

19:13.386 --> 19:15.087
- He said the press could
catch wind of that,

19:15.087 --> 19:17.089
I could lose my shot
at a college scholarship.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.825
- Did you just
show him the photos,

19:18.825 --> 19:20.126
or did you give them
to him?

19:20.126 --> 19:21.494
- I AirDropped them.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.896
He said he needed
the proof.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.867
- Give us a minute,
Jordan.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.135
- Uh, I--

19:29.135 --> 19:31.103
I don't know what this
is about, but Coach...

19:31.103 --> 19:32.505
he's a good guy.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.741
He always has time for
you, no matter what.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.078
- Jordan gave the Coach
the pics,

19:39.078 --> 19:40.613
and he used them
to catfish Zach.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.748
He's our man.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.450
- Okay, so Ms. Burnap
was telling the truth.

19:43.450 --> 19:46.152
Which means there are two
predators at the same school.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.820
- Well, it happens.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.422
- I'm assuming no luck
reaching Coach.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.890
- His cell phone went
straight to voicemail.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.459
TARU can't trace it.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.861
- For what it's worth, Donald
Basinski's got a stellar resume.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.263
He's been at River Park
for 12 years.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.930
He's five-time
Coach of the Year.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.367
- And if he's a predator,
this kid has no idea.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.270
- Right, because predators
know who to pick on.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.437
- Where does
this coach live?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.673
- Floral Park.
- Go. Now.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.842
- We need a warrant, Counselor.
- I'll get you one, just go.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.144
- NYPD!

20:12.144 --> 20:13.713
[police radio chatter]

20:13.713 --> 20:15.014
Go, go, go, go!

20:15.014 --> 20:18.017
[suspenseful music]

20:18.017 --> 20:20.253
*

20:20.253 --> 20:21.754
[police radio chatter]

20:21.754 --> 20:23.323
- Clear!

20:24.824 --> 20:26.626
- Two plates, two beers.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.160
They were here.
- Kitchen's clear.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.864
- Basement.
I'm going down.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.542
- I got pictures
of kids over here.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.544
[sirens approaching]

20:44.544 --> 20:46.813
[police radio chatter
continues]

20:46.813 --> 20:49.716
[ominous music]

20:49.716 --> 20:57.824
*

21:05.432 --> 21:06.666
- All these boys.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.835
Who are they?
What the hell happened to them?

21:08.835 --> 21:10.370
- We'll worry
about that later.

21:18.378 --> 21:18.511
.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.513
- There's nothing on real estate
searches or credit cards.

21:22.081 --> 21:25.352
Wherever he's taking these
kids, he's using cash.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.355
- APB on his car has him on
the New Jersey Turnpike

21:28.355 --> 21:30.357
headed north
late Friday night.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.424
No signs since then.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.992
- No luck here, either.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.395
Principal Bernstein's
going through photos now.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.063
Copy that, Lieutenant.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.798
- Well,
those are our uniforms,

21:38.798 --> 21:40.266
so they're all
River Park students.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.201
- Yeah, but do you
recognize any of them?

21:42.201 --> 21:43.202
- Not really.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.804
This is only
my second year.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.773
Are these all kids
Phoebe Burnap seduced?

21:46.773 --> 21:48.841
She got a thing
for wrestlers?

21:48.841 --> 21:50.777
- Wrestling team
have a training camp?

21:50.777 --> 21:52.178
- No.
We barely have enough money

21:52.178 --> 21:54.146
to get to the competitions.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.048
Have you talked to Coach
Basinski about these kids?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.216
- Can't reach him.

21:57.216 --> 21:58.451
Coach mention any
holiday plans to you?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.653
Second home,
maybe someplace upstate?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.088
- He's a wrestling junkie.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.123
He's probably spending the break
in a basement somewhere

22:04.123 --> 22:06.693
looking at scouting tapes.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.999
- Um...

22:12.999 --> 22:14.467
I don't know where
this was taken,

22:14.467 --> 22:16.268
but that kid's
Enrique Familia.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.204
- Okay, how do we get
in touch with him?

22:18.204 --> 22:21.574
- He was only here,
like, six months.

22:21.574 --> 22:24.310
Moved back to Colombia
or something.

22:24.310 --> 22:27.580
- Okay. He ever mention going
anywhere with Coach Basinski,

22:27.580 --> 22:29.416
maybe to train?

22:29.416 --> 22:31.418
- Uh, he didn't speak
much English.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.653
Only came to practice
for a few months,

22:33.653 --> 22:36.022
then just kind
of disappeared.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.991
- Yeah.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.793
Uh, that's Sam Moreau.

22:40.793 --> 22:41.861
- Is he in your grade?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.095
- He was a few years older.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.431
- Was?

22:44.431 --> 22:47.567
- He rammed his car into a tree
last Christmas drunk.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.002
Killed himself.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.672
- Zach just started managing
the team this year.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.007
Can't Coach Basinski
help you with this?

22:55.007 --> 22:56.909
- We don't know
where he is right now.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.344
- Why are you looking
for him?

22:58.344 --> 23:00.246
I don't understand--
you arrested Ms. Burnap.

23:00.246 --> 23:01.848
- We did.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.150
But she wasn't
involved with your son.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.654
- Coach Basinski is?

23:07.654 --> 23:09.321
- We don't know exactly.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.190
- That son of a bitch.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.259
That's why he took
an interest in him.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.294
That's why he said he could
be on the team next year!

23:15.294 --> 23:17.129
- And you wanted him
to play sports.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.698
- So this is my fault?
- Guys, guys--

23:18.698 --> 23:20.967
This--this isn't helpful.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.002
We need to find
your son right now.

23:23.002 --> 23:26.539
So I want to go over everything
that he told you about Coach.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.344
- Zach reveres him.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.980
He always says Coach
is the only one

23:33.980 --> 23:36.649
who believes
he can make the team.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.585
Isn't that Nat?

23:38.585 --> 23:40.219
- Nat who?

23:40.219 --> 23:42.489
- Nat Phelps.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.557
His sister, Sarah,
used to babysit Zach.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.392
Nat would come over
and pick her up.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.330
- How can we find him?

23:54.066 --> 23:56.068
- Basinski?

23:56.068 --> 23:57.670
I haven't talked
to him in years.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.739
- When he was your coach,
did you ever go on any

23:59.739 --> 24:02.141
out-of-town trips with him?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.142
- Who told you that?

24:03.142 --> 24:04.544
- Coach is missing.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.513
We searched his house
and found some pictures.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.880
- What kind of pictures?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.717
- Looks like
you're in a rural area.

24:10.717 --> 24:11.718
You remember that?

24:11.718 --> 24:13.085
- I don't know.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.587
The team traveled for
competitions.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.622
This could be anywhere.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.289
- I don't think so.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.826
Team probably didn't even go
with you on this trip.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.427
- I don't know what
you're talking about,

24:21.427 --> 24:23.830
and I gotta get
back to work.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.733
- Hey, this isn't
just about you, okay?

24:26.733 --> 24:29.235
There's a missing boy.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.103
We heard you know him.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.739
Zach Foster?

24:34.607 --> 24:36.142
- Zach?

24:36.142 --> 24:38.344
Last time I saw him,
he was a little kid.

24:38.344 --> 24:39.546
- Yeah,
we think Coach Basinski

24:39.546 --> 24:41.548
took him somewhere.

24:41.548 --> 24:44.784
Now maybe you heard Coach
talking about a cabin?

24:44.784 --> 24:46.318
A fishing lodge?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.220
Someplace he might go
in the winter.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.859
- Coach had a place
in Pennsylvania.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.160
But I never went there.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.362
- He mention
a road or a town?

24:56.362 --> 24:58.330
- If that's where Zach is,

24:58.330 --> 25:00.466
we're pretty sure he doesn't
want to be there.

25:05.838 --> 25:09.075
- There was some kind of
old-fashioned general store.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.877
Coach used to bring back
treats for the team--

25:10.877 --> 25:13.713
ice cream, chocolate
pretzels, candy...

25:13.713 --> 25:15.347
He said there was a Viking,

25:15.347 --> 25:16.816
some kind of sculpture
in the parking lot.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.350
- He said that?

25:18.350 --> 25:21.588
- Yeah. I never saw it,
but that's what he said.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.590
If it helps.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.192
- Thanks.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.963
- So have you seen this boy
in the last few days?

25:30.963 --> 25:32.398
- He looks kind of
familiar, I guess.

25:32.398 --> 25:35.167
- Yeah?
What about him?

25:35.167 --> 25:36.636
- Yeah, Coach B.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.071
That's how I know that kid.
They were in over the weekend.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.640
- Oh, good, so he is
with the coach.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.709
- You know, his parents
have been worried about him.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.043
He's not answering his cell.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.712
- There's literally
no reception up here.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.179
Like, one bar
on a good day.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.615
- Oh, so annoying,
right?

25:48.615 --> 25:51.083
Listen, you know where we might
be able to find them?

25:51.083 --> 25:53.620
- I know he fishes
up at the reservoir.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.987
He must have
a cabin near there.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.456
- Hey, does Coach still
have that same SUV?

25:57.456 --> 25:59.325
- Mm-hmm.
- Good. Thank you.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.827
- Thanks.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.930
[ominous music]

26:03.930 --> 26:06.999
*

26:12.404 --> 26:14.073
- Coach B, how you doing?

26:16.542 --> 26:18.210
- Hi, Al, what's going on?

26:18.210 --> 26:20.647
- We're having some trouble
with power lines down the road.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.214
Just want to make sure
your line is grounded.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.150
- Well, the line's
outside the house.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.318
- You mind showing me?

26:26.318 --> 26:27.820
- Yeah, okay.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.522
- Whoa, what's--
- Hey, NYPD.

26:30.522 --> 26:31.824
Where's the boy?

26:31.824 --> 26:33.359
- Who?
- Where's the boy?

26:33.359 --> 26:35.194
- Take him to the car.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.929
- Zach!

26:36.929 --> 26:38.330
Zach?

26:38.330 --> 26:41.934
[suspenseful music]

26:41.934 --> 26:43.703
Okay, you take that room,
and I'll take this one.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.071
- On it.

26:46.973 --> 26:47.974
- He's here!

26:47.974 --> 26:49.141
[whispering]
Zach...

26:49.141 --> 26:51.878
Zach.

26:51.878 --> 26:52.912
He's breathing.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.346
- We need an ambulance!

26:54.346 --> 26:57.183
- [whispering]
Oh, Zach. Zach...

27:02.722 --> 27:02.855
.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.290
- How's Zach doing?

27:05.692 --> 27:07.359
- There was alcohol
and Rohypnol in his system.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.761
No sign of external
injuries.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.030
- Okay, you did a rape kit?
- He refused it.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.799
He's conscious now,
asking for his parents.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.166
- Did you get
a statement from Zach?

27:14.166 --> 27:15.434
- He's receiving treatment.

27:15.434 --> 27:16.703
We're just about
to go in there.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.337
How're the parents doing?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.807
- They argued in the backseat
all the way up here.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.141
- How is he?

27:22.141 --> 27:24.210
- I wanna see Zach.
Can we see him?

27:24.210 --> 27:26.012
- Yes, of course.
- Follow me.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.714
- Is Basinski
with the state troopers?

27:27.714 --> 27:29.782
- Yeah, they processed him
so that we can extradite.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.017
- Look--Fin, Dodds,
head over.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.351
We're gonna go
talk to the boy.

27:34.386 --> 27:38.457
- This guy has been coming up
to his family cabin for years.

27:38.457 --> 27:41.227
And none of us had a clue.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.629
- That's how
they get away with it.

27:43.629 --> 27:45.832
- How's Zach doing?

27:45.832 --> 27:48.000
You know,
before I saw him,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.202
he was really having
a tough Christmas.

27:50.202 --> 27:52.004
- That's how this
is gonna go?

27:52.004 --> 27:53.505
- What're you
talking about?

27:53.505 --> 27:57.043
- Don't even try, Basinski.
We know you catfished the boy.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.011
- What?
W-what does that mean?

28:00.847 --> 28:05.451
Look, never mind.
This is what really happened.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.754
He comes from a broken home..

28:07.754 --> 28:10.489
and neither of his folks
wanted him over the holidays,

28:10.489 --> 28:11.758
so he ran away.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.492
And if I hadn't
stumbled upon him,

28:13.492 --> 28:15.294
God knows what
could have happened.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.764
- You drugged him.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.598
- I fed him.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.303
Okay, I gave him
a beer, too.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.138
I wanted him
to feel like a man.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.807
He has no friends, no life.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.175
- You know how to pick 'em.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.409
- What, the ones
who need help?

28:30.409 --> 28:31.811
Yeah. I do.

28:31.811 --> 28:34.446
Do you guys
even hear yourselves?

28:34.446 --> 28:36.282
I gave him a home
on the team.

28:36.282 --> 28:37.917
I taught him
how to wrestle.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.418
- He was grooming him.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.521
- Look, okay--
You're prejudiced, aren't you?

28:42.521 --> 28:45.424
Your mind's
already made up, but...

28:45.424 --> 28:47.794
but you know what
I'm talking about.

28:50.930 --> 28:54.801
Sports are good
for young men.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.203
Keeps them busy.
Channels that energy.

28:57.203 --> 29:01.273
[foreboding music]

29:01.273 --> 29:02.809
I bet you played
football, huh?

29:02.809 --> 29:04.610
Or boxed.

29:04.610 --> 29:05.845
- Don't change the subject.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.213
We found Zach
in that cabin.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.215
Whatever you did to him,
he was terrified.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.183
- The way you guys came through
the door, I'm not surprised.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.318
You scared him
half to death.

29:12.318 --> 29:13.519
- You know what, shut up!
Stand up.

29:13.519 --> 29:14.686
We're done, come on.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.122
- All right, all right,
so look at my record!

29:16.122 --> 29:17.824
- Come on!
- Coach of the Year!

29:17.824 --> 29:20.359
16 years, no one's ever
accused me of anything.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.829
Coach B is a stand-up guy.
You ask any of my kids.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.563
- Yeah, we already started.

29:24.563 --> 29:27.599
- Good! Then I'd like to
exercise my right to counsel.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.901
- My mom and dad
said I can go home.

29:28.901 --> 29:29.936
Can't we do this later?

29:29.936 --> 29:31.370
- Yeah, but, uh, Zach,

29:31.370 --> 29:34.273
sometimes it's better to
talk this through right away.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.909
- Now we understand that you
thought that you were meeting

29:36.909 --> 29:40.246
Ms. Burnap,
but Coach Basinski showed up.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.114
Is that correct?
- Yeah.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.550
He said he'd just happened
to be driving by.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.852
He offered me a ride home.

29:45.852 --> 29:47.719
- So you got in the car.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.156
And, uh...and then what?

29:50.156 --> 29:53.125
- He drove me to his house.

29:53.125 --> 29:56.128
He ordered pizza.
He gave me a beer.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.098
We watched hockey.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.868
I must've drank too much.

30:01.868 --> 30:04.003
I don't really drink,
all right?

30:04.003 --> 30:05.938
So it must've
made me pass out.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.774
- And then what happened?
That--that you remember?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.377
- I was in his car.

30:11.377 --> 30:15.181
On a highway at night.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.649
Look, he told me
he was driving me home.

30:19.618 --> 30:23.155
So I fell back asleep.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.258
When I woke up,
I was in that cabin.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.693
The doors were locked.

30:27.693 --> 30:29.896
- And where was Coach?

30:29.896 --> 30:32.899
[somber music]

30:32.899 --> 30:34.500
*

30:34.500 --> 30:37.436
- He was in bed with me.

30:37.436 --> 30:41.573
- Listen, I know
this is tough, Zach.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.175
But was he touching you?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.014
- I woke up...

30:48.014 --> 30:49.248
because his mouth--

30:49.248 --> 30:50.917
- It wasn't your fault.

30:50.917 --> 30:54.320
- His mouth was on me.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.455
And I wasn't into it,
all right?

30:56.455 --> 30:58.157
I'm not gay.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.659
I-I watch porn.
I do.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.694
And I'm talking
about normal stuff.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.397
Girls.
- Zach, listen to me.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.133
It means nothing.

31:07.133 --> 31:09.135
It doesn't mean anything.

31:09.135 --> 31:12.738
You were drugged and your
body reacted, that's all.

31:15.274 --> 31:16.642
So...

31:16.642 --> 31:18.077
what else do you remember?

31:20.446 --> 31:25.985
- Whatever he may
have made you do...

31:25.985 --> 31:27.619
that's on him.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.787
That's not on you.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.761
- Nothing else happened.

31:35.761 --> 31:38.430
I just want to go home.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.403
- Okay.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.308
- Happy holidays, everyone.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.842
Mr. Basinski,
how do you plead?

31:50.842 --> 31:52.444
- Not guilty,
Your Honor.

31:52.444 --> 31:55.014
My client has been a
well-respected teacher and coach

31:55.014 --> 31:56.815
for the past 16 years.

31:56.815 --> 31:59.986
The only reason he's here
is because another teacher,

31:59.986 --> 32:03.655
an admitted pedophile,
cut a deal implicating him.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.057
We request R.O.R.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.658
- Mr. O'Dwyer?

32:06.658 --> 32:10.329
- Mr. Basinski was found with
an intoxicated 15-year-old.

32:10.329 --> 32:13.199
He is being charged with
kidnapping, rape in the first,

32:13.199 --> 32:16.102
and promoting the sexual
performance of a child.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.404
He may be a danger
to himself and others,

32:18.404 --> 32:20.539
and he has daily
contact with minors--

32:20.539 --> 32:22.041
potential victims.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.775
- You don't need to
oversell, Counselor.

32:23.775 --> 32:27.413
Mr. Basinski,
bail is set at $500,000.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.848
Should you make bond,
you will be required

32:29.848 --> 32:31.417
to wear
an electronic monitor

32:31.417 --> 32:34.886
and be forbidden contact
with any minors.

32:34.886 --> 32:36.122
Understood?

32:36.122 --> 32:38.290
- Yes, Your Honor.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.192
[light knocking]

32:41.893 --> 32:43.495
- Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.064
Lieutenant Benson said you
needed to speak with me.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.065
- Actually, we don't.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.034
But this was her idea.

32:48.034 --> 32:51.870
- They're having second thoughts
about allowing Zach to testify.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.572
- Okay, well...

32:53.572 --> 32:56.208
this is a natural reaction
to a traumatic experience.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.909
- Coach is out on bail.

32:57.909 --> 33:01.247
- Yes. He put up
his house as collateral.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.881
He has to wear a monitor.

33:02.881 --> 33:06.185
He will not go near
your son or any other kid.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.719
- This is all
over the news.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.621
There are photographers
at the arraignment.

33:09.621 --> 33:12.191
Other moms are calling me,
asking about Zach.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.625
- And I explained to
the Fosters

33:13.625 --> 33:16.062
that there are
rape shield laws in place.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.830
- Everyone at school knows
Ms. Burnap and Coach Basinski

33:18.830 --> 33:20.199
were both arrested.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.301
- My boy's had it rough
enough at school.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.702
If word gets out
that Ms. Burnap

33:23.702 --> 33:25.371
sent those sexts
and seduced him,

33:25.371 --> 33:26.838
well, that's one thing,
but I don't--

33:26.838 --> 33:28.874
we don't want the whole world
knowing he's the kid

33:28.874 --> 33:30.509
who got it from
the wrestling coach.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.311
- And we understand that.

33:32.311 --> 33:35.381
And what we're asking
you to do is not easy.

33:35.381 --> 33:39.085
But you both are in a very
emotional place right now--

33:39.085 --> 33:42.088
- Thank you for your help.

33:42.088 --> 33:45.091
Serena, we're leaving.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.595
- Well, I'm sorry, I--

33:49.595 --> 33:50.829
I tried.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.531
- You know what?

33:52.531 --> 33:56.001
If it were my son,
I don't know what I would do.

33:56.001 --> 33:58.137
- Look, it's a reach,
but there are other boys.

33:58.137 --> 34:02.241
- Well, I need one of
them to come forward.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.646
- Nat.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.648
You got a minute?

34:09.648 --> 34:11.350
- Not really.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.985
- I'm, uh, Lieutenant Benson.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.021
And I just wanted
to thank you.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.557
Because of your help,
we were able to find Zach

34:18.557 --> 34:20.959
and Coach Basinski.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.595
- Zach okay?

34:23.595 --> 34:25.864
- Yeah, he will be.
We hope.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.633
- Well, good.

34:27.633 --> 34:30.136
Is that all?
- No. No, it's not.

34:30.136 --> 34:33.805
You know, Basinski
will be going to trial.

34:33.805 --> 34:36.575
So we want to get
as many stories

34:36.575 --> 34:38.877
on the record as we can.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.579
- You found him with Zach.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.248
That's enough
to bury him, right?

34:42.248 --> 34:43.982
- Well--

34:43.982 --> 34:46.685
- Zach's parents might not
let him testify.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.554
- Even so,
the guy's going away.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.990
- Listen, the truth is,
is that we need your help.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.995
- You mean testify?

34:56.995 --> 35:00.299
No. Forget that.
- Hold on, just hear us out.

35:00.299 --> 35:05.237
If we can get more stories,
he might take a plea.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.341
- And how many do
you have so far?

35:14.180 --> 35:16.582
That's what I thought.
Forget it.

35:31.197 --> 35:31.297
.

35:32.198 --> 35:32.664
- Sorry.
Struck out.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.434
Edward Yamaguchi wants to
see Basinski in jail,

35:35.434 --> 35:36.635
but he's not gonna
get involved.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.903
- Where are we
on the ten we ID'd?

35:37.903 --> 35:39.305
- Edward
was the last of them.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.639
Zach, Nat,
they're not gonna testify.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.773
- Sam Moreau is dead,

35:41.773 --> 35:43.475
Enrique Familia's
back in Colombia.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.444
These two swear nothing
happened and these three

35:45.444 --> 35:47.279
don't want their spouses
or family to find out.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.348
- Look it.
You know how it goes--

35:49.348 --> 35:51.082
when a boy goes through
something like this,

35:51.082 --> 35:52.918
they never tell anyone.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.386
- Excuse me.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.257
- Nat.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.226
Can we help you?

36:00.226 --> 36:01.693
- I think I can help you.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.229
- You're willing to
make a statement?

36:03.229 --> 36:04.696
- I don't have to.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.698
Got Coach's statement
right here.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.133
He confessed to everything.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.410
- Aah!

36:18.410 --> 36:20.879
Nat, please!

36:20.879 --> 36:21.947
Please...

36:21.947 --> 36:24.250
- There.
It's recording.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.717
Tell them what you did.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.453
Your own words.

36:27.453 --> 36:30.556
- You're having a hard time,
but this is not--

36:30.556 --> 36:32.123
- I said tell them!
- [groaning]

36:35.093 --> 36:38.264
- And he confessed
of his own free will?

36:38.264 --> 36:40.366
- I encouraged him.

36:42.768 --> 36:47.038
- Okay! Yes.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.741
- "Yes" what?
What did you do?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.646
- Yes, I had sex with you--

36:54.646 --> 36:57.283
- Not sex!

36:57.283 --> 36:58.584
You raped us!

36:58.584 --> 36:59.951
- Aah!

37:01.387 --> 37:02.988
Okay.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.190
- You raped all of us!

37:05.190 --> 37:07.426
- It's what they wanted.

37:07.426 --> 37:11.663
I was there for them,
for you.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.632
- No! Never!
- No?

37:13.632 --> 37:15.301
[blow landing]

37:15.301 --> 37:17.603
- I just wanted your help!
- Well, that's what I did!

37:17.603 --> 37:21.307
You wanted someone to care,
and that's what I did.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.474
- Care?

37:22.474 --> 37:23.709
[louder] Care?

37:23.709 --> 37:25.711
You never cared!

37:25.711 --> 37:27.879
How many boys did you
have up on your wall?

37:27.879 --> 37:28.880
Like trophies!

37:28.880 --> 37:30.215
- Ohh--

37:30.215 --> 37:33.051
- Tell me again!
I want names now!

37:33.051 --> 37:34.886
I said tell me!
- Ow!

37:34.886 --> 37:39.925
- Stop it! I want names!
[blow landing, Coach crying]

37:39.925 --> 37:43.329
- Okay, it was...

37:43.329 --> 37:45.931
Sam Moreau.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.234
Enrique Familia.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.002
Edward Yamaguchi.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.775
- He names
four others and me.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.777
Is that enough?

37:58.777 --> 38:02.681
*

38:02.681 --> 38:04.350
[police siren wailing]

38:04.350 --> 38:06.618
[brakes screeching]

38:17.629 --> 38:18.797
- Go.

38:18.797 --> 38:22.501
[police radio chatter]

38:22.501 --> 38:25.637
[sirens wailing]

38:33.379 --> 38:34.846
- He's alive!

38:34.846 --> 38:36.582
- We're gonna need that bus.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.754
- All right, hang on.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.390
Just hang on.

38:44.390 --> 38:47.759
- [whimpers]

38:49.628 --> 38:52.498
- Coach Basinski
died in the ambulance

38:52.498 --> 38:55.066
en route to the hospital.

38:55.066 --> 38:58.504
[solemn music]

38:58.504 --> 39:01.072
- He must've been
in a lot of pain.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.741
Did he bleed to death?

39:02.741 --> 39:04.309
- He did.

39:04.309 --> 39:05.977
- Good.

39:07.413 --> 39:10.248
- When did this happen?

39:10.248 --> 39:12.418
- Last night.

39:12.418 --> 39:15.587
I got my first good night's
sleep in eight years.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.761
Don't I need to make
a statement or something?

39:22.761 --> 39:25.096
- No. Not yet.

39:25.096 --> 39:28.299
You're under arrest
for murder now.

39:28.299 --> 39:32.203
I need to read you
your rights again.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.173
- You have the right
to remain silent.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.576
Anything you--
- I know all that.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.244
- You have the right
to an attorney.

39:39.244 --> 39:43.048
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.687
We'll be right back.

39:48.687 --> 39:53.459
You're not saying anything
until a lawyer gets here.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.867
- Do you usually encourage
your suspects to get a lawyer?

40:01.867 --> 40:02.968
- This is on us.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.436
We pushed this kid
to testify.

40:04.436 --> 40:07.873
- That's not what he did.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.308
- He was trying to
get a confession.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.377
He was molested
by the man that he killed.

40:12.377 --> 40:14.880
- He planned this.
He tortured that man.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.181
He left him to die

40:16.181 --> 40:19.150
and was glad to hear
that he bled out in pain.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.786
It was premeditated.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.821
- You're gonna charge him with
first-degree murder?

40:22.821 --> 40:24.355
That's 25 years.

40:24.355 --> 40:26.324
- His lawyer can plead for
leniency at sentencing.

40:26.324 --> 40:27.959
- His life will be over.

40:29.561 --> 40:35.333
- Lieutenant, his life...
was over at 15.
