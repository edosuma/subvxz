WEBVTT

00:06.089 --> 00:08.173
-Louis, where you go?
-Me will get Jared...

00:08.258 --> 00:11.386
-Me come help you?
-No, no, no. I got it. I got it.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.662
You not gonna say
something about Keesen?

00:37.746 --> 00:41.499
-Yeah, I don't know why he had to die.
-'Cause he was a fucking snitch.

00:42.834 --> 00:43.918
That's why.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.048
'Cause maybe he could've fucked
this whole thing up.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.091
Maybe he did fuck this whole thing up.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.219
Didn't your Auntie Mahabir say

00:53.303 --> 00:55.680
this kidnapping was supposed
to make everything all better?

00:57.682 --> 00:59.059
What's your point, Xavier?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.479
Well, you don't look like
you're doing any better.

01:05.397 --> 01:06.608
I got it, Xav.

01:12.864 --> 01:17.035
See, what I don't understand
is why my auntie insists on 1:11.

01:18.119 --> 01:21.081
Hmm? Not 1:00, not midnight.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.085
-1:11.
-Why anything, Aked?

01:26.044 --> 01:29.005
Ain't none of this make sense
if you ask me. Shooting up,

01:29.089 --> 01:30.632
-pickney in a crowded park--
-Hey.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.592
I know.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.261
What I don't understand...

01:37.305 --> 01:39.057
is why we had three shovels...

01:41.393 --> 01:42.936
and only two of them used?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.543
I would encourage you to be quiet

02:06.835 --> 02:08.877
until INC Fong is finished.

02:09.628 --> 02:10.630
Pete.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.383
Do you know why we called you in?

02:15.593 --> 02:18.054
If you're not firing me, then no.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.266
Washington Square Park. Last night.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.977
AINC Broward told me
you guys made the decision

02:24.060 --> 02:26.896
-to spend personal off department time.
-No, I-- Listen, sir.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.898
It was completely my own discretion--

02:28.982 --> 02:32.360
This was a mutual choice.
Two of the three unmarks were out,

02:32.444 --> 02:35.071
the third one was in the shop.
I told her to use her car

02:35.155 --> 02:37.781
and we'd invoice for mileage.

02:39.075 --> 02:42.620
Well, I wish you'd have stayed longer.
Just after 1:00 a.m.

02:42.954 --> 02:46.249
1:11 to be exact.
You left at midnight I'm told.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.502
There was apparently a shooting.
The father of a kidnapped child

02:49.586 --> 02:54.632
-appears to have failed to make a ransom.
-Yeah. NYPD is yet to release details,

02:54.716 --> 02:57.761
but they're putting together
an interagency task force

02:57.844 --> 03:00.305
with the FBI and, hopefully, us.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.142
-Us?
-Inspector Broward told them

03:04.225 --> 03:06.728
you had a mutual cooperator
who might have had eyes on it.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.481
Oh, I'm sorry. Manny told who what?

03:09.564 --> 03:13.526
I mentioned to NYPD
that one of our cooperators

03:13.610 --> 03:15.904
in the insurance whack-a-bum stuff

03:15.987 --> 03:18.448
might have been involved
in this kidnapping event.

03:18.823 --> 03:22.327
Wait. Can we just-- I'm sorry.

03:23.119 --> 03:26.122
Can we first start with the phrase,
"Mutual cooperator"?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.583
Because I think there's a little bit
of a misunderstanding--

03:28.625 --> 03:31.252
This might be a serious break for us.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.755
-Okay?
-Us as in mutual.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.340
-Oh, Jesus.
-Inspector Harmony.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.051
-Inspector Broward.
-I mean, it's just like...

03:39.886 --> 03:43.098
Yes. There is a chance,
the operatives last night

03:43.180 --> 03:45.600
in the park are also the people
we've been trying to get

03:45.684 --> 03:47.602
an angle on out in Richmond Hill.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.355
So, it looks like a botched kidnapping.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.942
Possible gunshot, but no body
and no further ransom demands.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.569
Parking enforcement official
heard a pop sound

03:56.653 --> 03:59.030
at exactly 1:11 a.m., called it in.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.867
The people she described as suspicious,
could be those of your cooperator.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.121
1:11 a.m.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.373
Why don't you two have a chat?

04:09.874 --> 04:12.877
-Let me know after you talk to your guy.
-Thanks, Peter. Sorry.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.968
Midnight? You tell him that
so it doesn't look

04:20.051 --> 04:21.511
like you ordered me off within minutes

04:21.594 --> 04:22.637
of the actual event?

04:25.223 --> 04:29.310
Enjoy what may very well
be your last fucking days.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.312
I was thinking about private security.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.941
-At least a temporary--
-Don't, I've already paid Joey.

04:35.025 --> 04:40.405
-Who's upstate with Jared?
-Yeah. About that, how long do we...

04:41.239 --> 04:43.700
Well, I told Joey, maybe tomorrow night.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.036
Once things settle and we can be sure

04:46.119 --> 04:48.371
they won't come back
if they realize their mistake.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.832
-Not if, but when.
-Right.

04:51.957 --> 04:53.668
Which is why I was thinking,
maybe, you know,

04:53.752 --> 04:57.297
-we install a system, maybe cameras.
-You do have a doorman.

04:58.048 --> 05:03.219
I just think, in case, you know,
if for some reason, it is more targeted.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.097
I know we said no more work.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.726
-You okay? Hon?
-Any news on the boy?

05:10.352 --> 05:11.519
-I don't--
-Targeted?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.440
-By who?
-Who? That's the question.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.400
Yeah. Well, that's what
we gotta figure out.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.613
And why? Why us?
Why my casino account?

05:24.824 --> 05:28.286
Hey, Dr. Prestwich said
one every six hours.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.164
Just have 'em. You don't need to take 'em.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.087
You okay?

05:38.088 --> 05:41.549
-Is there something else going on?
-You mean more than all this?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.761
Right. Yeah. Sorry.

06:14.165 --> 06:17.002
Hey, Siri. Search contacts for Charisse.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.421
You'll need to unlock your iPhone first.

07:04.466 --> 07:05.467
So...

07:06.509 --> 07:07.719
So people think I'm...

07:08.762 --> 07:09.888
dead?

07:11.222 --> 07:12.265
Yes.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.102
Which is why we need to call your parents.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.273
Let them know you're safe.
They got to be worried sick.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.318
Jared.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.529
We need to call them.

07:30.825 --> 07:35.163
Yeah, actually...
I think I'd like to wait on that.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.961
I think you're in shock.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.965
You've had a serious trauma...

07:47.634 --> 07:49.427
and we need to call them.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.390
Yeah, I just... This might sound weird,

07:53.473 --> 07:57.477
but I think it's gonna be
a whole, big thing.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.189
I just wanna prepare myself a little.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.535
Postmates.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.753
Look, you gotta understand
something about my parents.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.548
They're really rich and...

08:27.382 --> 08:29.968
they've always acted
like they don't want me around.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.429
And now they can see what it's like
to not have me around.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.640
Trust me, this is good for them.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.519
Where the fuck is Natalia anyway, huh?

08:39.894 --> 08:41.229
I've been calling her.

08:43.231 --> 08:47.068
My own fiancée won't answer my calls.
This is real fucking convenient.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.863
You know where she at?

09:02.792 --> 09:06.379
Mr. Paul say get rest.
We still have morning meeting tomorrow.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.719
I love how you the guy
getting the texts now.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.846
Hey, I never asked for any of this,
you know.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.098
Just leave me out of this, Xavier.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.820
Hey. What you do, boy?

09:33.782 --> 09:35.116
I gotta take a walk.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.536
What?

09:39.412 --> 09:42.540
Aked right. Your eyes going everywhere.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.213
Oh, yeah? You should talk.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.425
Aked.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.595
This is my nephew.
Isn't he as nice as I said he is?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.597
Very handsome. Yes.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.140
-Auntie.
-Hey, imagine

09:59.224 --> 10:01.810
I'm giving you a great big hug
right now, my dear.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.396
-Okay.
-Aked.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.856
This is a weekend of celebration

10:06.940 --> 10:09.567
and I was curious
if you knew anything about this?

10:10.276 --> 10:14.197
My appointment was two hours ago.
It's not like her to miss.

10:17.242 --> 10:21.705
It's a weekend of celebration.
I would hate to have to replace her.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.213
-I will call her.
-I know you will.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.423
Thank you.

10:31.923 --> 10:37.303
Our pain is over now. Over forever.
Thanks in great part to you.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.515
I'm happy to hear that.

10:42.225 --> 10:46.146
Come on! Be brave. Be brave. Be brave.
That's right. That's right. Come on!

10:48.356 --> 10:51.568
That's it! That's it! Ameena! Ameena!

10:52.402 --> 10:54.738
-Offside!
-All right. Good hustle! Good hustle!

10:54.821 --> 10:56.031
What you know about offside?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.325
Hey, offside, she said.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.037
Everybody listen to Hannah.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.831
Go get the ball! Go, go!

11:10.837 --> 11:12.005
Hey.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.967
Thank you for coming. Go inside there.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.599
So, listen.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.769
I wanted to give you my personal apologies
for the way it ended last night

11:25.852 --> 11:28.438
in Washington Square. All right?
It came from above me.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.982
Just so you know. I'm not like her.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.776
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.319
I'm not kidding, Garmen.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.280
If you go get the barbecue,
they're closing in 20 minutes.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.658
Hannah-Estelle, I know.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.833
Life is a series of little loyalty tests.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.920
Moment to moment,
you have to make a choice.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.589
Who to follow and who to trust.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.134
So far, two time,
you did what I asked you to do,

11:58.218 --> 11:59.344
and you did it well.

12:01.846 --> 12:02.931
So...

12:04.849 --> 12:06.184
why you're here.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.105
I want to give you this.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.942
Don't spend it all
on your little girlfriend, right?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.322
-Why you give me this?
-Because you earned it.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.032
You're the only one who earned it.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.827
Where your pal, Louis? You heard from him?

12:25.120 --> 12:26.496
He the informer, right?

12:30.208 --> 12:31.751
How about his sister, Natalia?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.426
Still not sure who you're loyal to, huh?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.845
Maybe me,
maybe your friend and his sister.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.681
I tell Savi not to talk she business
in front of the masseuse

12:44.764 --> 12:48.393
'cause me not like she, me not trust she,
but Savi, she don't listen.

12:50.020 --> 12:54.357
Also, she spoke to the INS lawyer
and they think they can extend your visa.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.195
Welcome.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.157
Are you done
with the American dream already?

13:02.532 --> 13:05.827
-Just want to go back GT.
-Oh, you think you can go home

13:05.910 --> 13:08.288
after the mess you
put yourself in with Mahabir?

13:09.456 --> 13:10.582
I don't know.

13:12.834 --> 13:16.004
If you do, you might need protection.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.132
I might need some too.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.509
Wait.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.179
You wanna go home?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.649
Can we have a conversation, you and me?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.486
About what?

13:41.404 --> 13:42.405
The future.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.992
Xavier, I don't know about this.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.663
I just got a bonus. That's all.
I just want to share it.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.500
I thought you said you work for a lady.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.252
-I do.
-Do you sell drugs for her?

13:58.088 --> 14:00.048
-Tell me.
-No.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.717
No, I do not do that.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.567
Am I interrupting?

14:19.651 --> 14:22.737
Just looking at Citizen app footage
from the park last night.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.117
From the back, quite likely my guy.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.327
Good.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.706
'Cause I spoke with Agent Roan Jessup,
Midtown FBI. We're in.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.958
And your cooperator's the linchpin.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.835
Will he talk to the task force?

14:37.293 --> 14:40.839
-My guess is only through me.
-Good. Keep it that way.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.966
I don't want them doing
an end around on us.

14:43.425 --> 14:47.554
I emailed you the police report.
Meantime, can you get downtown?

14:56.062 --> 15:00.567
Well, well, aren't we
all task force-y and diverse.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.820
Inspector Melody Harmony, USPIS.

15:04.362 --> 15:07.282
You must be FBI man, Roan Jessup?

15:07.657 --> 15:09.576
-Am I that obvious?
-Yes.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.455
-And that makes you...
-Detective Brian Sanders, NYPD.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.874
Pete Fong speaks very highly of you.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.501
All kidding aside, is that true?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.879
-Yeah.
-I'm actually not kidding.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.048
-Is that...
-Yeah.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.842
-Should we?
-Okay. Come on.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.764
So, NYPD is looking
at a potential homicide, of course.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.724
But what are you guys in this for?

15:33.600 --> 15:34.893
Well, some of the players

15:34.976 --> 15:37.395
may or may not overlap
with an old FBI cold case.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.647
-So, we're...
-Grasping for straws.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.401
I was gonna say
trying all angles, but sure.

15:43.902 --> 15:48.365
Oh, and did I get that report correct?
That they kidnapped the wrong kid?

15:49.366 --> 15:51.242
And did they kill him?

15:51.326 --> 15:54.037
The husband missed the drop off
by something like two minutes.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.915
They didn't even collect
the 315,000 dollars.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.378
The 314,159 dollars.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.005
-Yeah, what's that about?
-Well, it's not about the money.

16:05.173 --> 16:06.800
Well, it's not only about the money.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.844
And you know, obviously,
we can't assign a patrol car

16:09.928 --> 16:11.304
specifically to one block.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.515
Oh, of course, for sure.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.601
I was just wondering
if there was a way to,

16:16.685 --> 16:19.729
I don't know, alert them as to...

16:21.481 --> 16:24.192
Actually, yeah. I get it.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.403
Our turn for some questions?

16:27.404 --> 16:28.863
Yes. Please.

16:30.073 --> 16:33.034
Well, the obvious one,
of course, this boy,

16:33.618 --> 16:36.705
the one they may have mistaken
for yours. Any idea who he is?

16:36.788 --> 16:39.958
-We know his name is Nicky.
-I have a question.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.336
Is there a chance this is just a scam?

16:43.920 --> 16:47.048
You know, where they try to get money,
do they tend to go to these lengths?

16:47.590 --> 16:50.635
-Lengths meaning?
-Well, they cut an ear.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.595
I mean, a piece, it would appear.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.391
I'm just wondering, you know,

16:56.474 --> 16:59.352
-if maybe it's not as bad--
-Can you talk about the person--

16:59.436 --> 17:00.854
Are you saying you don't know him?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.065
You don't know the boy?

17:05.108 --> 17:08.944
Well, we didn't see him.
We saw an ear only

17:09.279 --> 17:11.489
and part of a cheek.

17:12.741 --> 17:15.035
So, did he have an accent,

17:15.117 --> 17:16.327
the guy on the phone?

17:18.246 --> 17:20.040
I don't know. What kind?

17:21.165 --> 17:25.170
-I don't know. Maybe Guyanese?
-Guyanese?

17:26.378 --> 17:28.006
Does that mean something to you or...

17:28.089 --> 17:34.012
Not really. It's just a rather
specific place to pull out.

17:36.181 --> 17:39.726
Are you sure you don't want anything?
Coffee or water?

17:43.271 --> 17:45.940
We're gonna wanna talk to your son
when he gets back in town,

17:46.024 --> 17:48.985
-but let's stay with the other boy.
-Does anyone know who he is?

17:49.527 --> 17:52.322
Not unless someone comes forward,
or we find the body.

17:52.781 --> 17:57.619
-Do we even know if he was shot?
-All we have is someone heard a shot.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.123
So you and your wife get home

18:02.207 --> 18:03.833
-from a charity event...
-Sam?

18:03.875 --> 18:06.336
Do you mind if I check out
your son's room?

18:07.170 --> 18:09.214
-My son's room?
-Around 8:30, 09:00.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.591
-I don't really recall.
-Yeah, just like a routine thing.

18:11.675 --> 18:12.801
Sure.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.844
-And it was your son's?
-Nice.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.347
Do you actually mind if you came with me?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.934
You know, kid's room.
I just don't want it to be weird.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.146
-Okay.
-How did they get his phone?

18:25.230 --> 18:27.565
He lost his phone a few days ago.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.693
You know that painting
would be worth a lot more

18:29.776 --> 18:32.278
if the head was on top of the body.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.822
Actually, it wouldn't.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.368
You know, I was joking about the painting.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.995
It's screwed in too.
You don't trust the cleaning lady?

18:42.997 --> 18:46.543
You've a nice place.
How long did the remodel take?

18:47.127 --> 18:48.294
A couple years.

18:48.753 --> 18:52.382
Been talking about it
for five or six, maybe.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.426
Lived here for ten. Why?

18:54.509 --> 18:56.594
How did that affect your marriage?

18:57.804 --> 18:58.847
I'm sorry?

19:01.349 --> 19:05.103
Oh, statistically 12 percent
of remodels end in divorce.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.649
You know, once the project is done,
there's nothing left to perfect.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.653
And we're talking about this why?

19:13.737 --> 19:15.905
What are you worried
about with your husband?

19:16.364 --> 19:17.782
What's he keeping from you?

19:18.616 --> 19:21.661
-I don't understand.
-Are you sure?

19:22.871 --> 19:26.583
-Am I sure that I don't understand? Yes.
-Yeah, 'cause I just can't figure out

19:26.666 --> 19:30.628
if he's trying to solve
a problem or if he's acting

19:30.712 --> 19:32.630
like he's trying to solve a problem,

19:32.714 --> 19:38.261
or if he's acting like he's acting
like he's trying to solve a problem.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.388
When exactly did your phone die?

19:40.889 --> 19:44.476
As he was saying,
"Walk to this..." something.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.104
I don't know. Might have just been a hiss.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.524
Circle maybe?
There was a chalk circle in the park.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.319
-Could it have been that?
-Another circle?

19:55.570 --> 19:58.156
-What do you mean?
-The money amount.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.992
Three, one, four, one, five, nine.

20:02.118 --> 20:05.872
-It's the circumference of a circle.
-Yeah, I remember that from high school.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.500
Well, a circle is often a thing

20:08.583 --> 20:10.960
used in all sorts
of shamanistic practices.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.921
In Guyana, it's called the obeah.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.715
And sometimes,
they'll create like a barrier

20:15.799 --> 20:19.469
to keep things in or out,
or create a ritualized space

20:19.552 --> 20:21.930
for concentrated magic, for instance.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.599
But it isn't usually
used for such negative purposes.

20:24.683 --> 20:28.061
But does that happen to you a lot,
your phone dying on you?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.440
-No. Never.
-Oh.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.321
-Thanks again.
-Bye, Sam.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.201
So how much do you
actually know about Guyana?

20:43.952 --> 20:46.287
My grandfather came
from Guyana, from Linden.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.998
He moved to South Florida,
married a Puerto Rican,

20:49.082 --> 20:51.459
and I grew up in Jersey City.

20:52.752 --> 20:56.756
So when they ask you a question
that you supposedly know the answer to,

20:56.840 --> 21:00.802
it's because you're a quarter Guyanese?
And your research consists of...

21:01.344 --> 21:03.972
-Calling my mother.
-That is rich.

21:04.597 --> 21:08.101
Yeah, you know what else is rich?
How much you think that remodel cost?

21:08.184 --> 21:10.186
Well, I don't think it was the apartment

21:10.270 --> 21:12.522
that they needed to take down
to the studs.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.984
-Meaning?
-They're all hiding shit.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.403
I mean, the boy clearly
snuck out last night,

21:18.486 --> 21:20.113
and who knows how many times
he's done that.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.991
And then the dad,
we asked him four times directly

21:23.074 --> 21:24.576
whether or not he knew the other kid,

21:24.659 --> 21:26.536
and he only ever responded
with a question.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.538
And then there's Sam.

21:29.539 --> 21:32.542
-What about her?
-Guyana.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.379
She clearly knows a lot
more than she's telling us.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.426
Yes. I'm trying to reach
Detective Manny Broward.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.012
I'm sorry, could you
repeat that name, please?

21:46.139 --> 21:47.849
Manfred Broward.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.268
You can tell him
Samantha Browne is calling.

21:50.352 --> 21:53.229
He may know my last name as McCusker.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.023
Just a moment.

22:02.697 --> 22:05.909
Hello. Detective Broward
is no longer with the department.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.827
Can I connect you with anyone else?

22:08.953 --> 22:13.083
-Oh. No. Thank you.
-Okay, then.

22:19.297 --> 22:20.840
-Hello?
-Derek.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.092
Voice from the past.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.761
Yeah, thanks for getting back
to me on a Sunday.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.305
Well, the service said
there was an emergency.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.390
Everything okay?

22:28.890 --> 22:31.685
Some clerical things. Just need you to...

22:33.478 --> 22:36.815
walk me through where we left off
language-wise last time.

22:37.315 --> 22:40.985
Last time being the paternity settlement
from 16 years ago, you mean?

22:44.322 --> 22:46.366
It sounds like you're in a place
you can't talk.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.368
Maybe call when you can
and leave a few more details.

22:48.451 --> 22:49.452
That work for you?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.705
That's what I'm thinking.

22:51.788 --> 22:54.416
Meantime, I'll have my secretary
pull up the old files.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.168
Meet in my office tomorrow,
I'll shoot you some times.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.336
That'd be great.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.500
Manny.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.502
-Manny!
-Yeah?

23:41.004 --> 23:45.050
When you were at the NYPD,
did you know Detective Gene McCusker?

23:45.592 --> 23:47.552
Yeah, we crossed paths occasionally.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.137
Occasionally?

23:50.597 --> 23:53.058
We shared some cases. Why?

23:53.892 --> 23:56.186
Is he related to Jeffrey McCusker?

23:56.770 --> 23:59.272
Yeah, they're brothers. Why?

24:01.149 --> 24:03.985
Serious question.
Why are you asking "why" so much?

24:04.402 --> 24:05.695
Oh, my God.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.491
Manny! Manny!

24:26.716 --> 24:28.051
Oh, my God, Louis.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.594
-Nat, Nat. Don't touch me.
-I was so scared.

24:29.678 --> 24:32.097
My skin dirty. Anybody calling you?

24:33.306 --> 24:35.809
Aked be calling like crazy.
Also Mrs. Mahabir.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.310
But I didn't pick up any of them.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.480
Hi, Jared.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.234
I sorry we kidnap you.

24:45.402 --> 24:47.237
And I sorry Aked did that to your ear.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.323
He was wrong to do that.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.955
Hey, Jared. I need to talk to my brother.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.164
Cool.

24:58.248 --> 25:00.625
No. I mean, I need to talk to him alone.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.887
Something ain't right with that boy.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.141
He don't wanna call his parents
and say he okay.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.686
He say they hate him
and he don't wanna go home.

25:20.270 --> 25:21.646
But they was gonna pay the money.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.481
Hundreds of thousands for him?

25:23.565 --> 25:26.776
That's why I'm saying
something ain't right.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.238
I say we take him back to the city
and drop him off. What you think?

25:30.822 --> 25:34.409
-No.
-He just give us more trouble.

25:34.909 --> 25:38.204
We plan for save he life
and he life saved.

25:38.288 --> 25:42.959
-Let we just end it now.
-And then what? How we gonna get home?

25:43.668 --> 25:46.921
They give way passport.
They never gonna give them back.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.883
We need money for buy we way home.

25:50.675 --> 25:53.428
And you're saying what? He the money?

25:53.762 --> 25:56.222
I saying, he parents try
for pay way before,

25:56.306 --> 25:58.475
so maybe they gonna try
for pay way again.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.896
So the kid we was trying
to save from being kidnapped

26:03.646 --> 26:05.398
we now kidnapping?

26:05.648 --> 26:06.900
You stupid ass, you.

26:07.484 --> 26:08.735
I don't know, man.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.862
Did you come up with a plan
for when after you save him?

26:10.945 --> 26:12.072
Did you?

26:12.155 --> 26:13.907
Yes, the plan I'm telling you right now!

26:22.457 --> 26:24.209
-I know what you want me to do.
-Come on, man.

26:24.292 --> 26:27.128
-I'm not gonna do it. Hold on, hold on.
-Taking all day, man.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.673
Hey, you guys. You know Clarence, right?

26:29.756 --> 26:32.717
-That new old guy?
-Yeah, have you seen him?

26:33.385 --> 26:35.762
-We're supposed to play.
-Yeah...

26:37.847 --> 26:39.808
Yeah, I heard he was at the hospital.

27:31.026 --> 27:34.404
Detective Sanders,
Agent Jessup, and Inspector Harmony.

27:35.238 --> 27:38.450
Miss Henrikson called to say
her son Nicky might be missing.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.660
I told her to come in and talk to you.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.747
I pressed Miss Henrikson
about who the father is.

27:43.830 --> 27:47.751
-She didn't wanna tell me. But it's high--
-It's Derek Browne.

27:50.378 --> 27:52.797
Oh, my bad. I stepped on your punchline.

27:54.674 --> 27:57.761
It's obvious. Come on.
Why else are we all here?

28:01.806 --> 28:04.434
And you can't talk about it?

28:08.772 --> 28:11.274
Are you in some type
of financial arrangement

28:11.358 --> 28:13.068
that requires your silence?

28:15.028 --> 28:18.114
Is this something that you know?

28:19.074 --> 28:22.243
Something that I'm winging,
but now that I said it,

28:22.327 --> 28:25.330
now that you're looking at me like that,
am I wrong?

28:25.872 --> 28:28.208
It's okay. You can talk about it here.

28:29.793 --> 28:30.960
Okay.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.296
So...

28:35.090 --> 28:37.425
my son, Nicholas, emancipated himself

28:37.509 --> 28:40.053
-just after he turned 16.
-You mean he ran away.

28:40.970 --> 28:41.971
Yes.

28:47.268 --> 28:50.021
-That.
-How long ago was that?

28:50.105 --> 28:51.690
Well, it couldn't have been that long ago.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.401
-Couple of months.
-We had an arrangement.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.861
-I wouldn't turn him in.
-Why?

28:57.737 --> 29:01.408
-I didn't want him to go into the system.
-Because you were once in the system.

29:03.118 --> 29:08.373
-A long time ago. But yes.
-You were away from each other for months,

29:08.915 --> 29:12.210
and suddenly, he's missing 24 hours
and you called the police.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.630
-Why?
-On Saturday, I wired him money--

29:15.714 --> 29:18.091
But it's still at the money wiring place,
so you're scared.

29:18.174 --> 29:19.843
Look, I don't have the mom gene.

29:20.510 --> 29:23.555
-I never did. I tried.
-Yeah, that's fine.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.390
And you figured out
an arrangement that works.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.684
I mean, there's no judgement. Seriously.

29:27.767 --> 29:31.688
Nicky gets these ideas...
and then he builds on them.

29:32.897 --> 29:33.982
He can be...

29:35.150 --> 29:37.068
I don't think he knows right from wrong.

29:37.569 --> 29:40.238
Your son has mental health issues
is what you're saying.

29:41.031 --> 29:43.408
-I think so.
-Do you know what kind?

29:44.951 --> 29:46.995
It's a type of dissociative disorder.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.416
Nicky once told me
that he was gonna take care of me,

29:51.499 --> 29:53.293
the way that his father never could.

29:54.919 --> 29:58.590
He can be somewhat...
obsessed with his father.

29:59.132 --> 30:01.926
But the thing is that he's never
actually met his father.

30:03.136 --> 30:06.598
Does his father have something to do
with why Nicky is missing?

30:07.932 --> 30:09.017
Ms. Henrikson...

30:10.143 --> 30:11.394
we don't know.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.564
But we want to, and when we do...

30:15.648 --> 30:17.650
I promise you that we will tell you.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.820
In the meantime,
you can shoot me your number.

30:20.987 --> 30:24.366
And if you don't mind,
your first name is...

30:25.283 --> 30:26.493
It's Charisse.

30:38.672 --> 30:39.881
Thank you.

30:42.926 --> 30:44.260
So, listen.

30:45.053 --> 30:48.056
I think about it,
and we actually do have an option.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.183
But it's risky.

30:53.561 --> 30:54.604
Outside.

30:56.147 --> 30:58.775
I have a friend, Eloise,

30:59.275 --> 31:01.486
but she does work now for Edward Chung.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.738
He does bring people
in and out the country,

31:03.822 --> 31:05.073
like Ms. Mahabir.

31:06.199 --> 31:08.284
You wanna go to Edward Chung?

31:08.368 --> 31:12.038
Eloise is my friend. From back in the day.

31:12.122 --> 31:17.043
-She works for Edward Chung.
-We have things we can offer him, Louis.

31:17.585 --> 31:22.298
I know things.
Things I hear in Ms. Mahabir's house.

31:23.133 --> 31:26.428
I can tell you things
he not gonna hear anywhere else.

31:28.013 --> 31:29.431
And she my friend.

31:31.141 --> 31:33.727
At least I could try and call she.

31:41.359 --> 31:42.402
Okay.

31:43.445 --> 31:44.821
Okay, we'll wait.

31:47.073 --> 31:50.660
Also, it's possible
there would be a third person.

31:50.744 --> 31:53.413
Louis's friend, Xavier.
He came here with him.

31:54.039 --> 31:57.125
But we won't know for sure
until after we talk to him.

31:57.709 --> 32:01.755
So maybe three of us, but definitely two.

32:05.675 --> 32:11.181
Eloise, thank you so much. Thank you.

32:13.183 --> 32:14.309
Okay.

32:17.020 --> 32:19.356
What? What she say?

32:21.983 --> 32:23.485
She gonna call me tomorrow.

32:25.028 --> 32:27.614
She say Mr. Chung
don't trust a lot of people.

32:28.031 --> 32:30.533
Especially those that work
for Ms. Mahabir.

32:50.512 --> 32:53.264
Fucking dick. It's the middle
of the night. What the fuck?

32:53.348 --> 32:54.432
You changed the locks?

32:54.516 --> 32:57.102
'Cause you got three moves, Mel,
and I know them all.

32:57.185 --> 32:59.854
Well, this is the one
where I come in and we make up.

32:59.938 --> 33:03.775
If I want to do this again in two months,
and again in four.

33:04.234 --> 33:07.529
Let me guess, you turned your informant
and now you think you can do it to anyone.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.865
I'm sorry, so you're the detective now?

33:10.949 --> 33:12.784
No. You're just that obvious.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.285
-I fucking saved you.
-Don't.

33:14.369 --> 33:18.581
-You were miserable with Victoria.
-I was a witness, Mel. Your witness.

33:19.082 --> 33:22.711
And it still embarrasses me
we met like that, so don't!

33:23.253 --> 33:25.797
-Please.
-Oh, my God.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.757
I'm gonna close this door.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.926
-What?
-And if you cross it again,

33:30.010 --> 33:32.429
-even with words--
-Carol, what?

33:32.512 --> 33:33.847
Let me finish, bitch.

33:35.223 --> 33:36.558
I will go ham.

33:37.684 --> 33:40.103
And I know this isn't the me
you think you know,

33:40.186 --> 33:41.730
but it has to be now.

33:42.105 --> 33:44.941
I can't do this anymore.
I'm done. I'm sorry.

33:45.525 --> 33:46.693
What--

33:47.652 --> 33:49.070
Carol!

33:50.321 --> 33:54.951
Carol! Come on! I said I was sorry.
You said you were sorry. Carol!

33:55.618 --> 33:57.912
Don't say I didn't warn you.

34:01.291 --> 34:04.377
Well, for the record,
I broke up with you first.

34:04.461 --> 34:05.670
Jesus.

34:05.754 --> 34:08.840
'Bout Scotty Frank? He has vault access.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.884
Could probably get personnel codes.

34:11.551 --> 34:15.179
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Frank's too dumb and too scared.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.556
First place I went-- What's his face?

34:17.639 --> 34:20.018
-Abrimonte.
-Too smart.

34:20.518 --> 34:23.063
Then who would have access
to McCusker's accounts?

34:28.360 --> 34:29.860
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:30.652 --> 34:31.905
That dumb shit.

34:32.322 --> 34:33.782
So yeah. So...

34:34.491 --> 34:37.619
some lady named something
or other Mahabir.

34:39.913 --> 34:44.125
She or somebody, I don't know,

34:44.542 --> 34:48.129
I guess, read something in People Magazine

34:49.005 --> 34:52.092
that Chef Jeff comes
into the casino a lot.

34:52.550 --> 34:56.179
And her guy, Garmen Harry...

34:57.138 --> 35:02.435
called me to find out
what his credit limit was.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.106
Same Garmen Harry who's into us for what?

35:06.523 --> 35:09.275
-Eighty-eight K.
-Let me guess.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.152
Some of that ransom money
was gonna be used

35:11.236 --> 35:12.362
to pay down his debt, huh?

35:13.363 --> 35:14.698
It was his idea.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.618
I just figured I could help you guys
get some of your money back.

35:19.411 --> 35:23.331
Oh. So you were doing us a favor
when some lady

35:23.915 --> 35:26.793
was so desperate,
she was willing to pay you 50K

35:26.876 --> 35:29.379
for whatever fucking numbers
you were gonna give her.

35:29.462 --> 35:31.006
Which is privileged information,

35:31.089 --> 35:33.883
which pollutes my goddamn reputation, Ron.

35:34.384 --> 35:36.094
I'm sorry.

35:37.804 --> 35:40.348
-Sy, I'm truly sorry.
-Whatever.

35:40.974 --> 35:42.809
We'll let the FBI work it out with you.

35:43.268 --> 35:44.477
FBI?

35:44.978 --> 35:46.521
There's a task force.

35:46.604 --> 35:49.649
FBI, NYPD,
and I believe Postal Inspectors.

35:50.567 --> 35:53.069
This kidnapping is some kind of bonanza
for all of them.

35:53.403 --> 35:56.823
-What? Why?
-You'll have to let me know.

35:58.033 --> 35:59.200
Good luck, Ron.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.369
Sy.

36:06.416 --> 36:09.961
Hey, Brenda, what's up?
Oh, my God! We had that press thing.

36:10.670 --> 36:13.965
Is my dad there?
Okay. Have him start without me then.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.725
Hey. I'm so sorry. I just need one minute.
Okay?

36:28.646 --> 36:32.150
Dad! What are you doing?
Why are you not in there?

36:33.318 --> 36:34.569
What's the charity?

36:36.071 --> 36:38.281
I mean on the new book? The proceeds.

36:38.365 --> 36:40.325
They're going to what charity?
They're all gonna ask.

36:40.408 --> 36:43.203
Ours. Service Kitchen. And three others.

36:43.286 --> 36:44.829
The José Andrés one, and two more.

36:44.913 --> 36:47.082
The ones we chose two months ago.

36:47.165 --> 36:50.043
Those are just names, Sam.
They're names of things.

36:50.126 --> 36:52.587
You need to tell me
what I need to remember.

36:52.671 --> 36:53.713
-You know? Also--
-What? That...

36:53.797 --> 36:55.382
That's why you didn't start the meeting?

36:55.465 --> 36:58.134
Maybe you could deign to look one
or two up once in a while.

36:58.218 --> 37:02.305
Just tell me to and I will. All right?

37:03.348 --> 37:07.435
Oh, also. The USA Today guy.

37:07.977 --> 37:09.854
You know the one
that did the five questions

37:09.938 --> 37:11.815
about whatever the fuck that was.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.734
Is it Nick or Rick?

37:14.818 --> 37:17.737
-It's Richard something.
-Are you sure?

37:18.530 --> 37:20.657
Hi. I am so sorry.

37:20.949 --> 37:24.244
We had a family emergency.
Everyone's good.

37:24.577 --> 37:25.704
Basically, yeah.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.540
Let's just say there are very few times
we relish

37:28.623 --> 37:30.542
talking to a gaggle of reporters.

37:32.043 --> 37:34.963
So, how did you go from a small,
self-produced tomatillo sauce

37:35.046 --> 37:38.341
and a handful of specialty stores
to a national brand?

37:39.092 --> 37:40.593
Very expensively.

37:45.223 --> 37:48.768
Well, we got lucky
on a couple of investments.

37:48.852 --> 37:50.937
And he said, you know,
"The heck with it!"

37:51.021 --> 37:52.689
"Let's go all in on my dream."

37:53.815 --> 37:55.650
-Well, that went really--
-What the hell, Dad?

37:55.734 --> 37:59.112
-Next time just start the damn meeting.
-Oh, come on, Sam.

37:59.195 --> 38:01.990
You know that I don't like
talking about my stuff.

38:02.073 --> 38:03.616
Yeah, you don't like when you have to tone

38:03.700 --> 38:05.410
the words down,
'cause you sound like a douche

38:05.493 --> 38:06.995
when you say
what you want people to print.

38:07.078 --> 38:10.373
Oh, we were doing the tag team.
For the good of the brand.

38:10.457 --> 38:12.375
No, do the "What, me worry" on them.

38:13.543 --> 38:14.836
Oh, Sam.

38:17.130 --> 38:19.382
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just...

38:21.509 --> 38:23.803
I think I'm a little scared.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.806
Yeah. I am too.

38:42.030 --> 38:43.114
Hello?

38:43.198 --> 38:47.077
A slice of Hawaiian pizza
if you guess who this is.

38:48.828 --> 38:51.623
Well, someone who knows
I used to like Hawaiian pizza,

38:51.706 --> 38:53.750
which I haven't since law school. So...

38:54.542 --> 38:55.835
Manny Broward.

38:56.211 --> 38:58.380
Oh, my God. Detective Broward.

38:59.172 --> 39:01.716
Well, it's Inspector Broward now.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.386
I'm no longer a cop. I'm USPIS.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.014
Wow, this is so weird. I was just talking

39:08.098 --> 39:10.183
-to a Postal Inspector.
-I know.

39:10.266 --> 39:13.144
And I was told you called
my old job looking for me.

39:13.603 --> 39:16.856
I bet I know why.
I thought the same thing you did.

39:18.233 --> 39:22.320
Yeah, the kidnapping ends at a park

39:22.987 --> 39:24.572
two blocks from your home.

39:26.449 --> 39:29.577
The target is Jeffrey McCusker's grandson.

39:29.911 --> 39:32.747
Jeffrey, whose brother Gene was...

39:32.831 --> 39:34.082
-I know.
-...discharged...

39:34.165 --> 39:35.166
-I know.
-...years ago

39:35.250 --> 39:36.292
'cause of, you know.

39:36.751 --> 39:38.753
Have you even spoken to him since?

39:39.254 --> 39:40.338
Gene?

39:41.297 --> 39:42.841
Gene McCusker wouldn't talk to me

39:42.924 --> 39:46.177
if I was bringing him
20 more years of being 20.

39:47.012 --> 39:52.267
Anyway, it's kind of a life's-too-short
sort of thing.

39:52.559 --> 39:53.685
The irony...

39:54.978 --> 39:56.062
Saturday night...

39:57.814 --> 40:02.485
I literally had someone at the park,
who left right before it went down.

40:03.111 --> 40:05.530
Yeah. It was just...

40:06.322 --> 40:09.492
I'm sorry. Personal issues.
Leave it at that.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.829
Was this Melanie Harmony?

40:12.954 --> 40:13.955
Melody.

40:16.499 --> 40:18.460
Her name is Melody Harmony?

40:19.919 --> 40:21.755
Might explain a few things, right?

40:22.422 --> 40:24.466
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Well, she was...

40:25.300 --> 40:28.428
-She was a loose cannon.
-Yeah, keep your wits about you.

40:28.511 --> 40:31.222
She has a history
of personal encroachment.

40:32.640 --> 40:33.641
So...

40:34.601 --> 40:36.311
you called because the kidnapping

40:36.394 --> 40:38.438
has you thinking about the Guyana deal.

40:39.647 --> 40:40.940
I wanna do the right thing.

40:42.359 --> 40:46.446
Sam, what happened over 20 years ago
with your uncle is between you and me

40:46.529 --> 40:50.075
and not relevant.
I protect my witnesses.

40:50.575 --> 40:52.077
My informants, my sources.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.245
I would think the past 20 years
has proven that.

40:54.329 --> 40:56.498
No, I get that. I'm sorry. I...

40:58.458 --> 41:00.710
-It still keeps me up sometimes.
-Oh, come on.

41:01.836 --> 41:04.798
I mean, I knew
Gene should've known better.

41:04.881 --> 41:06.591
-I don't think this--
-No, and we were a one-off.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.093
I mean, we were in and we were out.

41:08.176 --> 41:10.887
You gotta stop feeling sorry
for Gene McCusker.

41:11.971 --> 41:13.598
He got a cushy retirement.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.643
Is it...

41:18.520 --> 41:20.146
-His injury. His foot.
-Yeah.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.190
Is it true that that was self-inflicted?

41:23.108 --> 41:24.567
He never went to jail.

41:24.984 --> 41:28.405
He wasn't even charged.
He was protected by his own.

41:31.241 --> 41:34.035
It is impressive
whatever you guys have done

41:34.119 --> 41:35.745
with this Chef Jeff thing.

41:37.747 --> 41:39.290
You did the right thing.

41:39.749 --> 41:40.750
Back then.

41:42.544 --> 41:45.880
You did what you had to.
And everyone's fine.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.999
Thanks for seeing me at such short notice.

42:21.249 --> 42:24.586
-Did you get a chance to...
-I did look over the file. Yes.

42:25.545 --> 42:27.047
As for your initial question,

42:27.130 --> 42:29.883
while Ms. Henrikson technically
is not allowed to seek you out,

42:29.966 --> 42:31.968
it's trickier with her son, Nicholas.

42:32.385 --> 42:35.347
As he was a minor, a newborn at the time.

42:36.389 --> 42:37.432
So...

42:38.058 --> 42:39.601
The other question.

42:39.684 --> 42:42.103
-The reason I skipped the gym.
-Right.

42:43.438 --> 42:46.483
What if the mother was angry?
Which I would be.

42:46.566 --> 42:50.779
And wanted to try and prove,
I don't know, that maybe...

42:50.862 --> 42:54.991
maybe on the night, on Saturday,
I didn't... I don't know...

42:57.035 --> 42:58.119
try hard enough.

42:58.870 --> 43:02.916
You mean, could Ms. Henrikson
assert somehow her child

43:02.999 --> 43:05.460
-was killed because--
-I don't even mean consciously.

43:05.543 --> 43:07.379
Okay, on some level, you acted--

43:07.462 --> 43:09.047
Or failed to act. I don't know.

43:09.130 --> 43:10.965
Because why? Because unconsciously,

43:11.049 --> 43:13.635
you thought it would've damaged
your own life, let's say.

43:13.718 --> 43:15.220
Is that what you're asking?

43:15.303 --> 43:17.305
I'm not saying that happened.
I don't know what happened.

43:17.389 --> 43:20.892
I don't know how it happened,
but people, you know,

43:20.975 --> 43:22.102
-they talk about...
-Okay.

43:22.185 --> 43:25.522
...how people do things
they're unaware of, consciously.

43:25.605 --> 43:28.108
Derek, I'm gonna speak
hypothetically for a moment.

43:28.692 --> 43:30.318
If in the past a murder occurred...

43:30.610 --> 43:33.113
Let me finish. And you feel
you may have been,

43:33.196 --> 43:34.656
again in the past, a party...

43:34.739 --> 43:36.116
Please, let me finish, Derek.

43:36.199 --> 43:38.952
I'm just saying, if on a level
I was even unaware of.

43:39.035 --> 43:40.245
Derek, are you asking me

43:40.328 --> 43:42.497
if she might have a legal case
against you?

43:42.580 --> 43:44.499
Or are you asking
whether you have not legal,

43:44.582 --> 43:46.001
but maybe personal cause,

43:46.084 --> 43:48.169
to feel responsible
for this child's death?

43:52.298 --> 43:54.467
-It's stupid, right?
-No.

43:55.010 --> 43:58.096
But it's a question more
for a psychologist than an attorney.

43:59.305 --> 44:00.348
Right.

44:32.047 --> 44:33.381
Yeah.

44:39.637 --> 44:42.057
So, for three days, 16 years ago,

44:42.140 --> 44:44.642
you came into the club
and you said your name was Dave.

44:45.101 --> 44:47.020
Don't Dave me now, Derek.

44:47.103 --> 44:48.396
Yesterday, I was with the police.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.857
And today, you're here.
So what is going on?

44:50.940 --> 44:52.984
Why are you suddenly in my life again?

44:53.068 --> 44:54.402
Why were you at the police?

44:54.486 --> 44:57.030
-Is it because he didn't come home?
-Derek.

44:57.113 --> 44:59.949
You have to fucking tell me
what the fuck is going on?

45:19.219 --> 45:20.679
No, you do great.

45:20.762 --> 45:22.681
-You're okay.
-I don't get up ladders anymore.

45:22.806 --> 45:24.015
Well, thank God for...

45:31.439 --> 45:33.483
Uncle Gene. Aunt Cindy.

45:35.610 --> 45:38.029
I was hoping maybe we could all... chat.

45:44.577 --> 45:48.498
I don't understand.
You think my presence will help him?

45:48.957 --> 45:51.376
Maybe. I mean, he's pretty rattled.

45:51.751 --> 45:52.961
My brother's rattled?

45:53.712 --> 45:55.964
Well, I'm sure you can appreciate us--

45:56.047 --> 45:58.967
No, Sam, Sam.
Listen, you're a pretty girl.

45:59.467 --> 46:02.262
You've always been smart.
You're certainly too smart

46:02.345 --> 46:04.806
to do whatever the hell it is
you do for my brother.

46:05.265 --> 46:07.809
But don't patronize me with bullshit.

46:08.184 --> 46:09.853
You think just because he fucked me--

46:09.936 --> 46:12.272
-No, he vehemently denies it.
-No, you know he fucked me.

46:12.355 --> 46:14.941
He knows he fucked me.
That I had something to do

46:15.025 --> 46:17.485
with whatever the fuck happened
in the park?

46:17.569 --> 46:18.945
-Seriously?
-All right. You know what?

46:19.029 --> 46:20.238
-Gene. Gene.
-Are you kidding me?

46:20.697 --> 46:23.116
Samantha, it was really good
to see you, but I think--

46:23.199 --> 46:25.160
Cindy, this is a recon mission.

46:25.493 --> 46:27.787
Isn't it, Sam? This is recon.

46:27.871 --> 46:30.665
This is... Let's see
if old Uncle Gene has a tell

46:30.749 --> 46:32.834
before you open up
the whole can of worms, right?

46:33.752 --> 46:35.337
I used to do this for a living.

46:36.171 --> 46:37.714
"My dad is rattled."

46:38.256 --> 46:40.967
Which one of them sent ya?
Your mom or your dad?

46:42.469 --> 46:44.179
You know, I'd hate to be your son.

46:44.721 --> 46:47.432
With you still having to raise
your goddamn parents.

46:48.808 --> 46:53.438
-Chef Jeff is a fraud.
-My father works very hard.

46:54.314 --> 46:57.567
Well, isn't that nice
that he has a chance to do that?

46:58.068 --> 46:59.778
Maybe someday you'll ask him,

46:59.861 --> 47:03.782
why does he have to run all over the place
trying to prove what a good man he is?

47:03.865 --> 47:04.908
Ask him that.

47:05.492 --> 47:07.744
Ask him who was there for him
in the beginning.

47:07.827 --> 47:10.121
You know? Before the whole world
was kissing his ass,

47:10.205 --> 47:11.664
and then ask him where all of that

47:11.748 --> 47:14.292
-damn money came from.
-All right. Gene, that's enough.

47:14.376 --> 47:15.585
-Stop.
-What are you really

47:15.669 --> 47:17.128
trying to find, Sam?

47:17.796 --> 47:19.798
Why the hell are you really here?

47:22.801 --> 47:24.552
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.

47:25.345 --> 47:27.764
Sorry I came. Sorry, Aunt Cindy.

47:28.807 --> 47:30.517
Hey, you wanna know the...

47:30.600 --> 47:33.061
Wanna know the biggest difference
between Jeffrey and me?

47:34.813 --> 47:37.440
I said nothing about him.

47:37.524 --> 47:39.651
-Gene!
-Now, I was good cop.

47:39.734 --> 47:41.027
I made a mistake.

47:41.695 --> 47:42.904
And I paid for it.

47:43.405 --> 47:47.242
But I have said nothing.
All of these years and I still won't.

47:47.534 --> 47:50.829
Because I am not him.

47:53.289 --> 47:54.290
I understand.

48:25.280 --> 48:26.448
It's about time.

48:31.286 --> 48:32.412
Where's Louis?

48:34.789 --> 48:36.875
Well, ain't that the question of the day?

48:37.751 --> 48:39.669
We haven't seen him
since you dropped him off.

48:40.879 --> 48:42.130
Him or Natalia.

48:43.340 --> 48:44.924
There's another informer.

48:48.136 --> 48:49.429
And who that be?

48:52.766 --> 48:53.850
Well, guess what?

48:54.976 --> 48:56.227
It's not Keesen.

49:00.023 --> 49:01.024
Louis?

49:03.401 --> 49:04.694
Not just.

49:19.334 --> 49:20.835
What you doing, Aked?

49:21.086 --> 49:25.090
Googling Jared Browne with an E.

49:26.633 --> 49:29.260
Fucking rich white kid, Saturday night,

49:29.344 --> 49:31.763
Washington Square Park,
famous grandfather,

49:31.846 --> 49:33.306
bullet in the head.

49:34.683 --> 49:35.725
Nothing.

49:36.685 --> 49:37.811
Nothing.

49:38.436 --> 49:39.729
Not an article.

49:41.022 --> 49:42.774
Not even a fucking New York Post.

49:44.442 --> 49:45.777
Nah.

50:01.835 --> 50:03.837
Since when Jared got long hair like this?

50:03.920 --> 50:05.922
Aked, what you doing?
You want jumbie catch we?

50:06.006 --> 50:07.048
What the fuck is your problem?

50:07.132 --> 50:08.550
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't touch no dead person direct.

50:08.675 --> 50:11.177
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

50:13.013 --> 50:14.097
What?

50:15.223 --> 50:16.224
What?

50:21.229 --> 50:23.773
What if Louis ain't want me
to see Jared's body...

50:25.984 --> 50:28.028
'cause there wasn't any Jared's body.
