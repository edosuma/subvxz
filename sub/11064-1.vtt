00:05.965 --> 00:08.468
While most of President
Eisenhower's advisors...

00:10.804 --> 00:11.805
Today are ominous.

00:11.888 --> 00:12.888
Washington...

00:14.933 --> 00:17.727
If you have just tuned
in to this special bulletin,

00:17.894 --> 00:20.313
Washington has confirmed
that, yesterday,

00:20.480 --> 00:23.316
on the fourth of October, 1957,

00:23.483 --> 00:25.735
the Soviet Union
successfully launched

00:25.819 --> 00:28.071
history's first
man-made satellite

00:28.154 --> 00:30.281
into space orbit
around the Earth.

01:11.990 --> 01:14.701
The satellite, which the
Russians have dubbed Sputnik

01:14.784 --> 01:16.995
is being hailed as a
milestone in history.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.873
No one in our nation's capital
could deny that the satellite

01:19.956 --> 01:22.834
has ushered in a grim
new chapter in the Cold War.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.253
And indeed, a wave
of national anxiety

01:25.336 --> 01:27.255
already seems to be
sweeping the country.

01:27.338 --> 01:30.383
Still maintaining its
speed of 18,000 miles an hour,

01:30.550 --> 01:34.137
completing an orbit
of the Earth every 96 minutes.

01:42.562 --> 01:44.147
Doctor Wernher von Braun,

01:44.230 --> 01:47.192
chief engineer of the army
ballistic missile agency,

01:47.275 --> 01:49.235
expressed the hope
that the United States

01:49.319 --> 01:51.654
would soon be following
the Russians into space

01:51.738 --> 01:53.948
with our own
artificial satellite.

01:54.032 --> 01:55.450
Mister von Braun confirmed

01:55.533 --> 01:56.910
that there has
still been no actual

01:56.993 --> 01:58.328
sighting of
the Soviet satellite,

01:58.787 --> 02:01.623
but the U.S. expects
to be tracking it very soon.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.918
We are told that Sputnik will
be visible to the naked eye

02:05.001 --> 02:08.378
about an hour after sunset
and an hour before dawn,

02:08.463 --> 02:11.883
as it traverses the October
sky over the United States.

02:12.050 --> 02:15.136
What the beeping signal means
we still don't know.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.263
It may be nothing more...

02:38.117 --> 02:39.118
Let's go, Roy Lee.

02:40.578 --> 02:41.871
It's almost 9:00.

02:41.955 --> 02:44.165
Sure are in a hurry
to get yourself killed.

02:44.249 --> 02:46.125
No kiddin'. There
are easier ways

02:46.209 --> 02:48.127
to commit suicide, Homer.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.880
Will you just
step on it, Roy Lee?

02:50.964 --> 02:53.049
I am steppin' on it.

03:04.394 --> 03:08.314
Okay, Maguire, Longstreet, Hickam.
Let's see what you got.

03:10.775 --> 03:13.194
Hey, take it easy
on my kid brother.

03:13.278 --> 03:14.946
Make him look good, all right?

03:15.029 --> 03:17.282
Let's go! Hut!

03:19.784 --> 03:21.578
Hut two!

03:23.955 --> 03:25.832
I thought I told you
to take it easy on him.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.709
I did take it easy on him.

03:27.792 --> 03:28.918
Ten!

03:29.002 --> 03:30.922
I'm gonna run right over
you, you son of a bitch.

03:31.963 --> 03:33.047
You hear me?

03:33.131 --> 03:34.465
Hut one! Hut two!

03:40.889 --> 03:42.849
Homer, you sure got guts,

03:43.349 --> 03:45.476
but you gotta know when to quit.

03:45.977 --> 03:48.146
Okay, Miller!
You're up!

03:59.449 --> 04:00.449
Why should the damn jocks

04:00.491 --> 04:02.410
be the only ones
gettin' scholarships?

04:02.493 --> 04:05.121
They're also the only
ones that get the girls.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.664
This burns my ass.

04:15.173 --> 04:17.257
What do you
boys think about this?

04:17.341 --> 04:19.218
Isn't that something?
Hmm...

04:19.302 --> 04:21.095
Let 'em have outer space.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.347
We got rock 'n' roll.

04:22.764 --> 04:24.849
I'm with you. We got enough
to worry about down here.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.895
Homer, your dad say
anything about any layoffs?

04:28.978 --> 04:30.271
No.

04:30.355 --> 04:31.731
Have they pulled
any more pillars?

04:31.814 --> 04:33.066
Uh, he didn't say.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.568
Does he talk at all?

04:37.445 --> 04:39.197
Oh, yeah. He talks.

04:39.572 --> 04:40.907
Damn it, Jake!

04:40.990 --> 04:42.450
Didn't I tell you
to put some men

04:42.533 --> 04:44.202
to work on those roof bolts?

04:44.285 --> 04:45.536
Was I talkin' to the wall?

04:45.620 --> 04:47.348
I'm sorry, John.
We was just tryin' to get...

04:47.372 --> 04:48.790
Make sure the hoot owl shift

04:48.873 --> 04:51.417
sets those timbers by the vent!

04:56.881 --> 04:59.217
Two more days on that block,

04:59.300 --> 05:01.636
we're gonna be down to the bone.

05:01.719 --> 05:02.845
I guess that's...

05:05.932 --> 05:07.642
Jensen!

05:07.725 --> 05:08.893
Get out of the way!

05:08.977 --> 05:10.561
Jensen, look out!

05:16.442 --> 05:19.904
Come on.
Come on, Jensen.

05:20.405 --> 05:21.698
Come on back.

05:23.199 --> 05:24.742
Come on.
What happened?

05:25.076 --> 05:27.078
Whole damn mountain
'bout fell on your head.

05:27.745 --> 05:30.289
And John here...
He saved your life.

05:30.707 --> 05:32.375
That's my dad.

05:32.458 --> 05:33.835
I want you out of this mine.

05:33.918 --> 05:36.546
Don't come back, you
stupid son of a bitch.

05:36.963 --> 05:38.881
Didn't I tell you to
watch the roof, huh?

05:39.757 --> 05:41.175
Now we could've all been killed

05:41.259 --> 05:43.219
'cause you didn't have
the sense to look up!

05:43.636 --> 05:45.346
That's my dad.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.973
Homer.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.601
Well, how'd it go?

05:54.230 --> 05:56.899
Well, I told you. You spend
the summer shovelin' coal,

05:57.025 --> 05:59.736
and you'll be playin'
linebacker next fall.

05:59.819 --> 06:02.780
What's the matter, Homer?
Not cut out for mining coal?

06:02.947 --> 06:04.365
Me neither.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.077
Hey, let's get
that mess cleaned up!

06:09.203 --> 06:11.247
Let's get some
cribbin' on that roof!

06:11.622 --> 06:14.292
Buck up, Homer.
You're a Coalwood boy.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.575
When you get down in the mine,

06:15.585 --> 06:17.170
get that coal shovel
in your hand,

06:17.253 --> 06:19.172
feel just as natural to you
as a tick on a dog.

06:21.591 --> 06:23.676
And get that
slate off the loader!

06:23.760 --> 06:25.303
It's the radio signal

06:25.386 --> 06:26.929
transmitted by
the Soviet Sputnik.

06:27.013 --> 06:31.517
Listen now for the sound which forevermore
separates the old from the new.

06:41.152 --> 06:43.654
That's it?
That's the Sputnik?

06:43.738 --> 06:45.073
That's Sputnik.

06:45.156 --> 06:46.407
Well, big deal.

06:46.491 --> 06:49.827
Big deal?
What you fail to grasp

06:49.911 --> 06:51.638
is that the sound you're
hearin' is bein' transmitted

06:51.662 --> 06:54.707
by an object that is travelin'
at 18,000 miles per hour,

06:54.791 --> 06:57.251
559 miles high,

06:57.335 --> 06:58.920
and orbitin'
the Earth every nine...

06:59.003 --> 07:00.379
Shut up!

07:00.463 --> 07:01.672
Boys, not in my class!

07:02.632 --> 07:04.092
Thank you, Quentin.

07:04.884 --> 07:06.886
Now Quentin's right, y'all.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.848
Sputnik is a milestone
in history.

07:10.932 --> 07:13.351
Things'll never
be the same again.

07:14.685 --> 07:15.871
What do you think
about that, Homer?

07:15.895 --> 07:17.271
Well, yes, ma'am. Uh...

07:18.523 --> 07:19.524
Cat got your tongue?

07:19.607 --> 07:21.776
We were talkin' about
bein' in orbit,

07:21.859 --> 07:24.195
hundreds of miles
away from the Earth.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.197
You know anything about that?

07:27.031 --> 07:28.783
No, ma'am.

07:29.367 --> 07:31.035
I got my eye on you, boy.

07:31.661 --> 07:34.664
Now who can tell me why
Sputnik is so important?

07:34.956 --> 07:37.708
We ought to just
shoot the damn thing down.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.561
It's got one of them
little spy cameras in it.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.754
It takes pictures of every
one of our missile bases.

07:42.463 --> 07:46.634
This country'd better get on
the ball before it's too late.

07:46.717 --> 07:49.971
All I know is this Sputnik
had better show up soon.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.681
I'm gettin' a crick in my neck.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.641
All right.
What you need to do

07:53.724 --> 07:54.851
is take her to the movies.

07:54.934 --> 07:57.979
Somethin' scary, like
Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman.

07:58.062 --> 07:59.730
Then you take your arm
and put it up round

07:59.814 --> 08:01.482
the back of her chair, like so.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.693
Now when it gets real scary,

08:03.776 --> 08:05.977
and she ain't payin' attention
to nothin' but the movie,

08:06.529 --> 08:10.408
you sort of let your arm sort
of slide on down her shoulder,

08:10.491 --> 08:13.035
real nice and slow and easy,

08:13.870 --> 08:14.954
until...

08:15.872 --> 08:17.582
Hey! Hey!

08:17.665 --> 08:19.083
I see it! Right there!

08:19.167 --> 08:20.168
Where? Where?

08:22.253 --> 08:24.255
You seein' things, Carl?

08:29.427 --> 08:30.595
I see it.

08:30.761 --> 08:31.929
Where?

08:32.013 --> 08:33.597
I see it.
It's right there.

08:44.192 --> 08:46.277
Wow.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.663
Son of bitches gonna be droppin'
bombs on us from up there.

08:57.747 --> 08:59.707
Don't know why they'd drop
a bomb on this place.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.335
Be a heck of a waste of a bomb.

09:06.047 --> 09:08.341
The first game against Welch...

09:08.424 --> 09:10.384
That's the one that's
gonna draw the scouts.

09:10.468 --> 09:12.970
Yeah. Welch knows it too. They're
gonna be coming after us.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.555
Well, y'all be careful, Jim.

09:14.639 --> 09:17.099
Last year, those two boys from
Welch got their arms broken.

09:17.183 --> 09:18.559
Well, they started it.

09:19.852 --> 09:21.687
It don't matter much
who started it.

09:21.771 --> 09:23.189
I don't call that football.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.149
You don't worry about Jim.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.736
Ain't nobody on the Welch
team that can catch him.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.299
I wish the scouts could've seen
that first game with Bluefield.

09:31.322 --> 09:32.990
I'm gonna build a rocket.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.286
Like Sputnik.

09:38.496 --> 09:41.415
Well, I'm not sayin' it's gonna
go up in space or anything,

09:41.499 --> 09:43.167
but I'm gonna do it.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.046
I'm gonna build a rocket.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.882
Well, just don't
blow yourself up.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.846
More eggs, anybody?

09:55.930 --> 09:57.348
Nice rocket, Homer.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.766
How high do you
think it will fly?

09:58.849 --> 10:01.894
Well, I got it packed with the
powder from 30 sky rockets.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.021
Three, four miles.

10:04.397 --> 10:06.649
You ready? Yeah.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.317
Yeah.

10:09.068 --> 10:10.945
Ten, nine,

10:11.070 --> 10:13.281
eight, seven, six... Should
we get behind somethin'?

10:17.702 --> 10:20.329
What happened?

10:20.413 --> 10:22.164
My rocket blew up.

10:22.248 --> 10:23.416
Are you okay?

10:23.499 --> 10:24.499
I guess.

10:24.542 --> 10:25.584
My heart's poundin'.

10:25.668 --> 10:29.171
I thought the mine blew up.
Oh, Homer.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.843
I waited six months
for the company carpenter

10:33.926 --> 10:35.767
to finally get around
to puttin' up that fence.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.389
Didn't I tell you not
to blow yourself up?

10:39.515 --> 10:41.058
Yes, ma'am.

10:41.142 --> 10:44.812
Then let's not.

10:45.396 --> 10:46.981
Elsie.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.691
It's all right,
Ms. Fields.

10:48.858 --> 10:50.234
It's all right.

10:51.402 --> 10:53.946
Dear Dr. von Braun...

10:54.030 --> 10:55.072
Six, five, four, three...

10:55.156 --> 10:56.258
My name is Homer Hickam.
Two, one...

10:56.282 --> 10:59.535
I'm 17 and I live in a small
mining town in West Virginia.

10:59.618 --> 11:00.911
Ignition.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.165
Liftoff. Liftoff.

11:04.248 --> 11:06.917
I'm writing to offer my
condolences to you and your team

11:07.001 --> 11:10.379
on your recent attempt
to launch the Vanguard rocket.

11:12.006 --> 11:13.883
I also had
a disastrous occurrence

11:13.966 --> 11:16.594
during the launch
of my own small rocket.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.641
Since here in Coalwood,
everyone's much more interested

11:22.725 --> 11:25.144
in what's down below the Earth
than what's above it,

11:25.227 --> 11:27.438
there isn't a whole lot
of material to be found

11:27.521 --> 11:29.148
on the subject of rocketry.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.692
So I've been kind of
stumbling around in the dark.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.879
You can't be seen
with him, Homer.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.924
He's a weirdo.
You go ahead,

11:55.007 --> 11:57.510
but you can kiss your
social life goodbye.

12:01.389 --> 12:03.474
Hi, Homer.
Hi.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.613
I don't let anybody
copy my homework.

12:18.489 --> 12:20.950
I don't wanna
copy your homework.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.326
Um,

12:23.828 --> 12:25.913
do you know anything
about rockets?

12:25.996 --> 12:27.498
Of course I do.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.334
Uh, you wanna come with
me over to the library?

12:30.835 --> 12:32.253
No.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.228
What do you wanna
know about rockets?

12:50.396 --> 12:51.856
Everything.

12:54.150 --> 12:59.488
Well, rocketry was actually invented
by the Chinese as early as 1,000 A.D.

12:59.655 --> 13:01.740
And, supposedly, they
were quite sophisticated.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.874
"Potassium
chlorate and sulfur."

13:10.833 --> 13:13.377
Uh, well, what'd you use?

13:14.378 --> 13:16.130
Uh, somethin' like that.

13:17.006 --> 13:19.133
Hey, Quentin, this is great.

13:19.717 --> 13:22.553
This is exactly... We have
everything we need in here.

13:23.179 --> 13:24.972
Roy Lee, drive me to my house.

13:25.389 --> 13:26.515
We can use my basement.

13:26.599 --> 13:28.201
Yeah, at least nobody'll
see us down there.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.477
Go, go, go.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.188
Come on.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.898
You got a loose choke cable.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.150
You hear that?

13:36.233 --> 13:38.819
The butterfly valve
isn't closin' all the way.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.076
Uh, last year I built
an internal combustion engine

13:46.160 --> 13:48.162
and entered it in
the science fair.

13:48.496 --> 13:50.896
Yeah, well, you wouldn't happen
to have it on you, would you?

14:10.809 --> 14:11.810
Ugh!

14:15.981 --> 14:18.025
Ow!
I'm sorry.

14:22.613 --> 14:23.781
You missed a spot.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.375
This thing's startin'
to look like a rocket.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.877
Listen to this.
"Weld the washer

14:36.961 --> 14:38.712
"to the base of the rocket body,

14:39.338 --> 14:42.383
"creating a combustion chamber
and nozzle."

14:42.800 --> 14:45.219
We don't know how to weld. Weld.

14:45.302 --> 14:48.639
Homer, your brother's in metal shop.
Maybe he could, uh...

14:51.725 --> 14:53.227
Do we really need
this nozzle thing?

14:53.310 --> 14:54.728
For cryin' out loud,

14:54.812 --> 14:56.397
the nozzle's
the most important part.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.190
It directs the flow
of the hot gases!

14:58.274 --> 14:59.817
Hey, cool it, Quentin.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.403
Man, talkin' about
your hot gases.

15:09.243 --> 15:10.411
I don't think your father

15:10.494 --> 15:13.247
would like you sneaking up in the
middle of the night in here,

15:13.330 --> 15:15.082
and I know that
he wouldn't like me

15:15.165 --> 15:16.917
welding for you on company time.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.628
Well, what if I paid
the company for your time?

15:20.462 --> 15:21.880
Homer, I can't.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.675
I would lose my job.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.344
I'm sorry.

15:28.679 --> 15:31.974
Did you see Sputnik go
over the other night? Nah.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.478
'Cause it was beautiful.

15:37.479 --> 15:40.190
I stood there and watched it
streak across the sky.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.443
And anywhere in the world,

15:42.526 --> 15:44.903
someone could look up
and see exactly what I saw.

15:46.447 --> 15:50.034
For once, it felt like Coalwood
was part of the outside world.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.745
Homer, believe me,
there are much

15:52.828 --> 15:55.080
worse places than
Coalwood in this world.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.001
Besides, this is just
a flying piece of steel.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.380
You know, a rocket took it
up there, Mr. Bykovsky.

16:04.715 --> 16:06.091
I don't know. I...

16:06.800 --> 16:09.261
When I was workin' on
this rocket, I felt like,

16:09.345 --> 16:11.639
I felt like I was,

16:11.722 --> 16:13.974
like I was Wernher von Braun.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.560
Let me see.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.273
Homer,

16:23.609 --> 16:25.653
it will be our secret.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.115
Mr. Bykovsky did
a dang good job on this.

16:30.199 --> 16:32.326
Yeah, well, he used
a washer for the weld.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.537
Man, it looks just like it did
in the picture. Prodigious.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.331
When, uh, when do we go?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.249
Give me that.
Uh, Saturday...

16:39.667 --> 16:41.710
What is this,
a weapon of some kind?

16:41.877 --> 16:44.380
No, sir. It's a,
it's a rocket.

16:44.672 --> 16:47.257
I don't allow dangerous
devices on school grounds.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.719
Mr. Turner, I asked Homer
to bring that to school.

16:50.803 --> 16:51.970
To show it in class.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.702
You know, the boys
are thinkin' about

16:53.764 --> 16:55.557
enterin' that
county science fair.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.560
Be careful, gentlemen.

16:58.644 --> 17:00.229
I'm gonna have my eye on you.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.563
Thank you, Mr. Turner.

17:02.773 --> 17:05.733
That science fair is rigged.
All the judges are from Welch,

17:05.818 --> 17:08.153
so only the kids
from Welch ever win.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.948
And besides, science
fairs are for geeks.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.491
No offense, Quentin.

17:12.825 --> 17:14.992
Well, it's too bad
you feel that way.

17:15.077 --> 17:18.579
You know, the winners go on to the
national Science fair in Indianapolis,

17:18.664 --> 17:22.251
and colleges from all over the
country hand out scholarships.

17:22.626 --> 17:25.253
It's great.
Have a good lunch, boys.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.467
College scholarships
for winning a science fair?

17:30.801 --> 17:32.302
Well, maybe it's not for you.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.263
Well, what do you mean?

17:34.388 --> 17:35.889
Homer, you got a great mind.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.891
But science requires math,

17:37.975 --> 17:40.352
which has never been one
of your favorite subjects.

17:41.937 --> 17:45.399
Can't just dream your way
out of Coalwood, Homer.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.408
Auk I.
Stroke of genius, Homer.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.577
It won't fly unless
somebody lights the fuse.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.704
What the hell is a Auk?

17:59.037 --> 18:00.497
It's a bird that don't fly.

18:01.165 --> 18:02.833
What, kind of like a parakeet?

18:03.459 --> 18:05.127
Ready?

18:05.627 --> 18:08.881
Well, Youngstown's
always been fair, Otis,

18:09.757 --> 18:11.133
but you're asking me to

18:11.216 --> 18:12.760
lay off damn near half the town.

18:13.719 --> 18:16.138
The mine is just not producin'

18:16.221 --> 18:18.098
the way it was
10 years ago, John.

18:18.474 --> 18:21.268
We're payin' the same labor
for half the tonnage.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.688
What if we were to
open up a new shaft?

18:24.772 --> 18:26.982
That coal is down there, Otis.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.193
You just let me go after it.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.988
The Coalwood mine is
givin' out, Mr. Hickam.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.077
Move!

18:40.954 --> 18:42.164
Ten...

18:42.247 --> 18:43.874
Nine, eight,

18:43.957 --> 18:47.044
seven, six, five,

18:47.461 --> 18:50.297
four, three, two...

18:53.050 --> 18:57.262
Uh-oh. Holy shit, it's
headed for the mine!

19:00.182 --> 19:02.309
I told you we didn't
know what we were doin'!

19:02.392 --> 19:04.228
I told you!
Oh, no. Oh, no.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.195
I don't believe this.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.279
Go ahead.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.450
God in heaven, I thought
it was a guided missile!

19:19.409 --> 19:21.787
I thought the damn
Russians were attackin' us.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.748
The boy's in trouble now.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.214
So this is what you been up
to in the basement, huh?

19:32.631 --> 19:33.715
Yes, sir.

19:33.799 --> 19:34.842
Damn, Homer.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.178
You could've killed somebody
with this idiot thing.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.847
I know, sir.
I'm sorry. I was...

19:39.930 --> 19:42.683
Well, Homer here wants to be a
rocket scientist. Is that it, John?

19:42.766 --> 19:44.935
He has no idea
what he wants to be.

19:46.103 --> 19:49.231
But I know what he is.
He's a menace,

19:49.314 --> 19:50.983
and he's a damn thief.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.402
Dad... And so is
whoever helped you.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.154
Ike Bykovsky
did this, didn't he?

19:56.905 --> 19:59.157
Don't you ever let me catch you

19:59.241 --> 20:02.369
with these fool things on company
property again, you understand me?

20:03.996 --> 20:05.205
Yes, sir.

20:05.289 --> 20:06.456
Then go home.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.309
Yeah? What's your
tunnel number?

20:26.310 --> 20:30.480
He called me a thief, Ma,
in front of everybody.

20:30.564 --> 20:31.857
I mean, how could he do that?

20:31.940 --> 20:33.984
He was dead wrong
callin' you that.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.320
He'd never have
done that to Jim.

20:36.612 --> 20:39.197
They could catch Jim
stickin' up the company store,

20:39.573 --> 20:42.284
and Dad would probably laugh
and say, "That's my boy."

20:42.492 --> 20:44.745
I know he's hard to understand
sometimes, Homer,

20:44.828 --> 20:46.914
but you have to
know he loves you.

20:46.997 --> 20:49.374
He loves the mine...

20:49.917 --> 20:51.418
More than Jim even.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.170
More than you.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.504
You hush up.

20:56.048 --> 20:57.507
What's it given him back?

20:57.841 --> 21:01.261
Nothin' but a spot on his lung
the size of a damn quarter.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.059
You don't know what
the mine gives me.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.646
You don't know
'cause you're still a boy.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.858
But, by golly, you're gonna
find out soon enough.

21:24.701 --> 21:27.454
I'm never goin' down there.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.335
You better have a talk
with your son, Elsie,

21:34.461 --> 21:37.422
'cause he's out of control.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.314
Where's my rocket stuff?

21:54.398 --> 21:56.566
Right where they belong.

22:16.253 --> 22:19.548
Quentin, you know, that rocket
went up at least 100 feet.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.759
More like 200.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.512
God...

22:27.222 --> 22:29.349
Man, will you
cut it out, Roy Lee?

22:29.433 --> 22:31.518
Die, you son of a bitch.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.145
Come on.
My turn now.

22:33.228 --> 22:34.438
Hey, man.
What's with you?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.457
Man, we should be tryin'
to get in that science fair

22:36.481 --> 22:38.801
instead of sittin' around here
like a bunch of hillbillies.

22:38.984 --> 22:42.529
I got some really bad news for you, Homer.
We are a bunch of hillbillies.

22:42.612 --> 22:46.491
Besides, um, didn't your
dad say no more rockets?

22:46.575 --> 22:49.161
No. He said no more rockets
on company property.

22:49.244 --> 22:50.704
Do you realize how far

22:50.787 --> 22:52.473
we'd have to go to get
off company property?

22:52.497 --> 22:54.166
Yeah.
We have to go to Snakeroot.

22:54.249 --> 22:56.585
Snakeroot?
That's eight miles.

22:56.668 --> 22:59.838
It's not that far. I mean,
we could walk if we have to.

22:59.921 --> 23:03.175
Oh, walk. That's
a fantastic idea.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.551
Let's go! Come on!

23:04.634 --> 23:05.927
Wake the hell up,
will ya, Homer?

23:06.428 --> 23:08.406
I got about as much chance
of winnin' that science fair

23:08.430 --> 23:10.599
as you do winnin'
a football scholarship.

23:11.183 --> 23:12.768
I know I'm gonna be a miner.

23:13.143 --> 23:15.187
I've known my entire life.

23:15.479 --> 23:17.230
What the hell's so
bad about minin' coal?

23:17.314 --> 23:18.857
Nothin', Roy Lee.
Coal minin's great.

23:19.316 --> 23:23.570
That's why your stepdaddy's the
biggest drunk in West Virginia.

23:23.653 --> 23:27.824
I mean, come on, guys!
You know the mine'll kill ya.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.660
Did you ever hear the story
about how O'Dell's dad died?

23:30.869 --> 23:32.537
Homer, will you forget it, man?

23:32.621 --> 23:33.621
Shut up, Homer.

23:33.663 --> 23:36.541
A piece of slate caught
him right in the neck

23:36.625 --> 23:38.126
and cut his head clear off.

23:38.335 --> 23:39.377
Bitch! Come on!

23:40.629 --> 23:42.005
O'Dell!

23:44.841 --> 23:46.134
Get off of me!

23:46.218 --> 23:49.012
Hey, fellas.
We're lookin' for U.S. 52.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.227
Uh, fellas?

23:55.852 --> 23:57.521
Uh, just, uh, stay
left at the fork.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.364
It's about another
five miles straight ahead.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.691
Thanks.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.868
You fellas see the way
she was lookin' at me?

24:14.579 --> 24:16.706
Man, you all
wanna be coal miners,

24:17.582 --> 24:20.127
you all go ahead
and be coal miners.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.100
There. There.

24:49.197 --> 24:50.782
God's honest truth, Homer,

24:50.866 --> 24:52.242
what are the chances

24:53.076 --> 24:55.203
of a bunch of kids from Coalwood

24:55.412 --> 24:57.581
actually winnin'
the National Science Fair?

24:58.248 --> 24:59.833
A million to one, O'Dell.

25:01.376 --> 25:02.669
That good?

25:03.378 --> 25:07.090
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on. Give me that.

25:08.884 --> 25:10.260
Quentin.

25:16.808 --> 25:17.893
What?

25:40.582 --> 25:43.251
We hiked eight miles for this?

25:43.335 --> 25:46.087
Oh, it's great.
What should we call it?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.215
How 'bout a slack dump?

25:48.298 --> 25:50.133
What about "No Man's Land"?

25:51.301 --> 25:52.802
Cape Coalwood.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.430
I mean, it's perfect.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.642
We could build
a blockhouse over there,

25:58.725 --> 26:00.685
and... And a...
And a... And a launchpad.

26:01.770 --> 26:04.356
And we could even
build a test stand!

26:17.452 --> 26:18.954
Dear Dr. Von Braun,

26:19.037 --> 26:21.414
our launch site, which
we've named Cape Coalwood,

26:21.498 --> 26:22.540
is nearing completion.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.504
Thanks to the generosity
of local businesses.

26:38.098 --> 26:40.058
Inspired by our efforts,

26:40.141 --> 26:42.686
everyone is anxious to help
by donating materials.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.983
We've been fortunate to have
the support of our classmates.

26:48.066 --> 26:50.485
And the whole community
here in Coalwood is behind us.

26:51.569 --> 26:54.114
Hey, Rocket Boy.
Mars is that way.

26:54.197 --> 26:56.992
But no one has been more encouraging
to our efforts than my father.

26:57.075 --> 27:01.204
No, the company doesn't have any
cement left over for launchpads.

27:02.038 --> 27:03.290
I just thought I'd ask.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.709
Besides, I told you
no more rockets.

27:06.584 --> 27:09.212
Uh, you said no more rockets
on company property.

27:09.963 --> 27:11.548
And Olga doesn't own Snakeroot.

27:12.716 --> 27:14.467
So, you walk eight miles?

27:15.051 --> 27:16.386
Yes, sir.

27:19.472 --> 27:21.266
Well, tell me something, Homer.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.854
Uh, what exactly is this
Wernher von Braun

27:25.937 --> 27:28.523
and the rest of those Germans
accomplishin' anyway?

27:28.940 --> 27:31.693
'Cause if you ask me,
it's nothin' but a stunt.

27:32.402 --> 27:33.945
You think...
You think catchin' up

27:34.029 --> 27:35.989
to the Russians in
space is a stunt?

27:36.072 --> 27:39.159
When the novelty wears off, they're
all gonna be sent packin'.

27:39.242 --> 27:42.037
Maybe then they'll have to
find themselves a real job.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.747
Like minin' coal?

27:45.790 --> 27:47.208
You listen here.

27:48.001 --> 27:50.503
The coal we mine
makes steel, Homer.

27:50.754 --> 27:53.506
And if steel fails,
this country fails.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.760
If you had half a damn brain
in your head, you'd know that.

28:01.473 --> 28:02.932
Well, who's down there now?

28:03.808 --> 28:06.269
Hold on just a second.
Hey, listen here.

28:06.353 --> 28:09.356
I had an engineer
estimate a new walkway.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.441
They had some cement left over,

28:11.524 --> 28:14.736
so it got caught in the rain...
It's probably ruined.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.988
But if you wanna
haul it out, it's all yours.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.115
Thanks, Dad.

28:20.992 --> 28:22.452
I'll be down there in a minute.

28:27.582 --> 28:31.628
And Miss Riley wanted to make
sure you document your results.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.296
You will be graded
when she returns.

28:34.214 --> 28:35.673
You have one hour.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.718
Potassium chloride
has a potassium atom.

28:39.344 --> 28:42.764
If we mix it with
sugar and add heat,

28:43.348 --> 28:46.059
we'll get three parts oxygen,
two parts carbon dioxide,

28:46.142 --> 28:47.894
along with some other
by-products.

28:48.311 --> 28:50.605
In other words, lots of
good expanding gases.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.500
It should make
an excellent propellant.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.777
It smells like candy. Ooh!

28:57.529 --> 29:00.073
Better get started.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.159
All right, quick.
Get rid of it.

29:33.106 --> 29:36.776
Mr. Bolden, have you seen
Mr. Bykovsky around?

29:36.860 --> 29:39.612
He's not in the shop anymore.

29:40.530 --> 29:42.657
Your dad sent him
down to the mine.

29:47.662 --> 29:50.748
He's takin' it out on you
because you helped me.

29:50.999 --> 29:54.461
That's enough of that.
Your father is a fair man.

29:54.544 --> 29:57.297
If he's strict,
it's because he has to be.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.132
Besides, he did me a big favor,

29:59.215 --> 30:01.009
transferring me
from the machine shop.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.552
What are you talkin' about?

30:02.635 --> 30:05.472
I can make twice as much money
down there working the high coal.

30:06.347 --> 30:07.807
You can?

30:08.224 --> 30:09.642
I've got relatives in Europe

30:09.726 --> 30:11.895
who've had hard time
recovering from the war.

30:12.729 --> 30:14.731
They depend on me for
whatever I can provide.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.858
So, believe me,
I can use the extra money.

30:16.941 --> 30:18.141
I'm just sorry I won't be able

30:18.193 --> 30:19.903
to weld any more
rockets for you.

30:23.406 --> 30:24.908
That's for good luck.

30:28.870 --> 30:31.080
Maybe you could
teach me how to weld.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.666
Welding is very
difficult, Homer.

30:33.750 --> 30:34.959
I could learn.

30:38.505 --> 30:40.256
You don't give up, do you?

30:42.759 --> 30:43.760
I can't.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.940
- Come on, son.
- Hi, Mr. Bolden.

31:00.944 --> 31:03.696
Hey, Homer. I heard
you tellin' Ike

31:03.780 --> 31:06.533
you were gonna be shootin' off
another rocket up here today.

31:06.616 --> 31:09.452
I... I thought that might be
somethin' we'd like to see.

31:12.163 --> 31:13.540
Whoa!

31:15.124 --> 31:16.918
Eight, seven,

31:17.377 --> 31:19.420
six, five,

31:19.587 --> 31:21.047
four, three...

31:24.801 --> 31:26.928
Hey, look out!

31:27.887 --> 31:29.222
Mr. Bolden!

31:32.308 --> 31:34.561
Mr. Bolden, are you okay?

31:34.644 --> 31:35.728
I'm all right.

31:38.606 --> 31:40.066
I'm sorry about that, sir.

31:40.149 --> 31:41.627
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.

31:41.651 --> 31:45.280
Homer, I flew with the Red
Tails in World War II.

31:45.780 --> 31:48.074
And seein' that rocket
come at me...

31:48.157 --> 31:49.826
It almost took me back there.

31:52.245 --> 31:53.913
Hey, let me have
a look at that thing.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.251
That's a good job
on the weld, Homer,

31:58.668 --> 32:02.171
but the heat from the
exhaust melted the washer.

32:02.672 --> 32:06.342
It's referred to as
a nozzle... Uh, sir.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.596
Son, you can call it
whatever you wanna call it,

32:10.054 --> 32:12.348
but you're gonna have
to have a better steel

32:12.432 --> 32:13.766
that can take the heat.

32:14.392 --> 32:18.771
Now I'd say S.A.E. 10-20 bar
stock ought to do you fine.

32:18.855 --> 32:20.565
And I can order it for you.

32:20.648 --> 32:22.233
Well, that'd be
great, Mr. Bolden.

32:22.358 --> 32:25.903
But it's kind of expensive.
Um...

32:27.280 --> 32:29.032
Twelve miles of scrap iron,

32:29.115 --> 32:30.783
and all we gotta
do is pop it loose.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.619
Yeah. Now what are
we gonna tell

32:32.702 --> 32:34.430
the railroad when they catch
us pryin' up the track?

32:34.454 --> 32:36.205
It's abandoned.
See, the county's

32:36.289 --> 32:38.041
covered with abandoned
spur lines.

32:38.499 --> 32:40.835
A mine shuts down,
the track just rusts over.

32:46.716 --> 32:47.884
$8.20.

32:48.885 --> 32:50.720
This is worth $8.20?

32:52.013 --> 32:53.389
A ton.

32:54.641 --> 32:55.850
Come on.

33:00.438 --> 33:02.982
This thing weighs
a ton all by itself!

33:04.817 --> 33:05.818
Four-hundred pounds.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.571
Four-hundred pounds?

33:09.405 --> 33:10.657
All right.

33:11.783 --> 33:15.078
O'Dell, you're sayin'
this thing is worth a buck 65?

33:17.080 --> 33:19.957
Woo-hoo!

33:26.881 --> 33:27.965
Whoa.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.192
O'Dell?

33:47.110 --> 33:50.363
I... It's abandoned.
Uh, look at the rust.

33:50.446 --> 33:53.449
Caretta number two
shut down in '51.

33:55.451 --> 33:56.536
Shit!

33:56.619 --> 33:59.247
Get it up!
Get it up! Just get it up!

33:59.706 --> 34:01.916
Give me a hand, man.
Come on!

34:07.964 --> 34:10.425
Forget it! Forget it!
Just stop the train!

34:10.507 --> 34:12.592
Roy Lee!

34:14.512 --> 34:16.013
- Stop!
- Stop! The track's out!

34:17.223 --> 34:18.306
Stop! Stop!

34:18.391 --> 34:19.391
Stop it!

34:23.312 --> 34:24.938
Stop!
Stop!

34:25.022 --> 34:26.565
The track!

34:50.547 --> 34:53.176
S.A.E. 10-20 bar stock.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.137
Then go 30 degrees crucial.
When the fuel combusts,

34:56.679 --> 34:58.598
it creates
a controlled explosion.

34:58.681 --> 35:01.392
The nozzle directs
a river of hot gas

35:01.476 --> 35:03.811
that can reach
the speed of sound

35:03.895 --> 35:05.563
when it hits the mouth
of the nozzle!

35:05.646 --> 35:08.191
Hey, Quentin.
Sorry.

35:12.695 --> 35:14.447
It's called a tapered bore.

35:15.072 --> 35:18.826
A tapered bore. Now he's takin'
off just a little bit at a time.

35:36.636 --> 35:38.554
Good deed, good deed.

35:46.521 --> 35:48.373
I'm concerned that the mass
of the added propellant

35:48.397 --> 35:51.400
compared to the mass of the empty
rocket will be too little.

35:51.484 --> 35:53.402
Uh, he's afraid
it'll be too heavy.

35:53.486 --> 35:55.238
Why don't we
just make it longer?

35:56.239 --> 35:57.949
Longer would allow
increased volume

35:58.032 --> 36:00.201
for the propellant
without much additional mass.

36:00.910 --> 36:01.994
Great idea.

36:27.854 --> 36:29.021
We got one!

36:53.754 --> 36:58.050
My guess is, is we're gettin' air
pockets in the body of the propellant.

36:58.134 --> 37:01.554
When the fire hits 'em, they act
like little combustion chambers.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.973
I think we're gonna need
a liquid binder of some sort.

37:04.307 --> 37:07.852
What about gasoline?
That's a good idea.

37:09.937 --> 37:12.273
"Four unidentifiable
high school students

37:12.356 --> 37:14.483
"lost their lives
earlier this mornin'

37:14.567 --> 37:16.652
"when their
toy rocket exploded."

37:17.320 --> 37:20.489
Alcohol. I mean,
alcohol's stable.

37:21.157 --> 37:22.992
And it'll evaporate quickly.

37:24.452 --> 37:27.079
Yeah, but it'd have
to be 100% undiluted.

37:27.163 --> 37:29.874
None of that watered-down stuff
they sell at the company store.

37:29.957 --> 37:32.209
I have no idea
where we could find that.

37:35.671 --> 37:38.215
Listen. I know these fellas,
so let me do all the talkin'.

37:38.674 --> 37:40.551
I'm not gonna say a word.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.806
Is that rocket fuel or what?

38:19.882 --> 38:21.717
Great.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.719
How'd they find out about it?

38:25.346 --> 38:26.806
My brother.

38:30.101 --> 38:31.703
You know, we poop out this
time, the whole county's

38:31.727 --> 38:32.979
gonna be laughin' at us.

38:33.062 --> 38:34.939
Who cares what
any of them think?

38:35.022 --> 38:36.315
Easy for you to say, Quentin.

38:36.399 --> 38:37.918
You're used to people
makin' fun of you.

38:37.942 --> 38:39.151
All right now.

38:39.235 --> 38:40.820
Quentin's right, y'all.

38:40.903 --> 38:43.823
Homer, you don't have to
prove anything to anybody.

38:44.198 --> 38:45.533
You remember that.

38:46.242 --> 38:48.119
Now go launch yourself a rocket.

38:52.999 --> 38:54.333
Come on, boy.

38:54.417 --> 38:55.710
Homer!

38:55.793 --> 38:56.919
Hello, Dorothy.

38:58.254 --> 39:00.047
Is that thing really gonna fly?

39:00.131 --> 39:01.382
Well, it, uh...

39:01.799 --> 39:04.510
That thing had better fly, or
you can kiss your chances of

39:04.593 --> 39:06.846
losin' your virginity goodbye.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.724
Hey, couldn't you guys
find somethin' better to do?

39:10.307 --> 39:12.685
Hey, listen. There's no
practice on Saturdays.

39:12.768 --> 39:15.479
You little sisters are the
only entertainment in town.

39:15.563 --> 39:18.149
Yeah, we were gonna drive over
to War, but then we thought,

39:18.232 --> 39:20.609
"Hey, let's go see
Homer blow himself up."

39:21.986 --> 39:23.571
That's real funny, Jim.

39:41.881 --> 39:44.175
Hey, Homer, come on.
We don't got all day.

39:44.258 --> 39:47.303
Shut up, Jim.
Homer, everything ready?

39:48.387 --> 39:50.097
Wait, wait. What?
What do you mean, wait?

39:50.181 --> 39:51.390
Where are you goin'?

40:06.113 --> 40:07.531
Hurry up, y'all.

40:09.075 --> 40:11.577
All right. It won't fly unless
somebody pulls the string.

40:18.334 --> 40:21.128
- Ten...
- Nine, eight,

40:21.212 --> 40:23.506
seven, six,

40:23.589 --> 40:26.175
five, four...

40:30.179 --> 40:32.515
Oh, my God!

40:49.031 --> 40:50.741
That's great!

40:56.539 --> 40:58.666
Homer, that was unbelievable!

40:58.749 --> 41:00.126
Let's go, Dorothy.

41:01.252 --> 41:02.604
I'll tell you
what's unbelievable...

41:02.628 --> 41:04.880
The captain of the football
team bein' jealous of you.

41:07.550 --> 41:10.136
What you think about gettin'
in that science fair now?

41:10.219 --> 41:11.846
I think we got a chance.

41:17.685 --> 41:19.436
Well, bless her heart.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.064
Aunt Joanne hasn't seen you
in about a year and a half.

41:22.148 --> 41:23.691
You look like a sausage.

41:23.774 --> 41:24.942
He does not.

41:26.652 --> 41:29.113
Happy birthday, Homer.

41:30.406 --> 41:32.158
It'll stretch some
when you wear it.

41:32.241 --> 41:34.052
You be sure and send her
a nice thank you note now.

41:34.076 --> 41:35.244
All right.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.246
John?
Huh?

41:37.913 --> 41:40.624
Oh, happy birthday, Homer.

41:41.542 --> 41:44.253
And I got this in the mail.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.463
Must be a present from Grandma.

41:47.965 --> 41:49.091
What's this?

41:54.138 --> 41:56.015
Oh, it's an autographed picture.

41:56.515 --> 41:59.018
Of Grandma?
Rather get socks.

41:59.101 --> 42:00.477
Wernher von Braun.

42:01.103 --> 42:04.064
Well, wonder how he knew
it was your birthday.

42:04.148 --> 42:05.524
I don't reckon he did.

42:05.941 --> 42:09.904
"Dear Homer, congratulations
on your rocket building.

42:09.987 --> 42:11.788
"Continue your education
and maybe one day..."

42:11.864 --> 42:14.491
Boy, you better take an
interest in your own damn town.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.203
Instead of wastin' your time,

42:17.286 --> 42:20.789
worryin' about Wernher von Braun
and, uh, uh, Cape Canaveral.

42:20.873 --> 42:23.417
John, it's his birthday.

42:27.254 --> 42:29.965
All right, Homer. Uh...

42:39.016 --> 42:40.392
Yeah?

42:41.143 --> 42:43.562
Homer, there's strike
talk startin' up again.

42:43.646 --> 42:45.689
Your father's... Yeah, he's
got a lot on his mind.

42:45.773 --> 42:48.192
Yeah, well, I don't give a damn.

42:50.653 --> 42:53.072
"Principles of
Guided Missile Design."

42:53.614 --> 42:54.990
I had Miss Waters order it

42:55.074 --> 42:56.951
for you a while back,
and it just came.

42:58.994 --> 43:01.705
I know the math is too advanced for you.
It is for me too.

43:01.789 --> 43:03.391
There's Calculus,
differential equations...

43:03.415 --> 43:04.750
No, I'll learn the math.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.503
This is great, Miss Riley.
I'll learn everything.

43:08.587 --> 43:10.547
It's the best present
that anyone's ever given me.

43:11.840 --> 43:14.843
Thank you.
I'm gonna show the guys.

43:15.219 --> 43:16.659
Well, Quentin will
probably go cra...

43:16.679 --> 43:17.972
Goodness gracious, Hickam.

43:18.055 --> 43:20.015
Watch where you're goin'.
Just...

43:21.350 --> 43:22.434
Where'd you get this?

43:22.518 --> 43:23.644
I gave it to him.

43:25.271 --> 43:26.480
Bye, Miss Riley.

43:29.149 --> 43:31.944
Miss Riley, our job is to
give these kids an education,

43:32.027 --> 43:33.362
not false hopes.

43:34.321 --> 43:35.698
False hopes?

43:37.199 --> 43:38.867
Do you want me to sit quiet,

43:38.951 --> 43:41.287
let 'em breathe in coal dust
the rest of their life?

43:41.370 --> 43:44.498
Miss Riley, once in a while,

43:44.581 --> 43:47.376
a lucky one will get out
on a football scholarship.

43:47.459 --> 43:50.170
The rest of 'em
work in the mines.

43:50.796 --> 43:53.799
How about I believe
in the unlucky ones, hmm?

43:54.133 --> 43:57.136
I have to, Mr. Turner,
or I'd go out of my mind.

44:03.225 --> 44:04.310
It's good, it's good.

44:04.393 --> 44:05.477
Hey, Homer.

44:05.561 --> 44:06.729
Happy birthday, Son.

44:08.063 --> 44:09.732
Got some good news
for you, Homer.

44:10.190 --> 44:13.485
Say hello to Fred Smith from the
University of West Virginia.

44:13.569 --> 44:15.070
Hello, Homer.
Hi, sir.

44:15.154 --> 44:17.239
Mr. Smith wants Jim
to play football there.

44:17.323 --> 44:19.325
He's offerin' him
a full scholarship.

44:19.950 --> 44:21.744
Well, congratulations, Jim.

44:22.536 --> 44:23.996
Do you play ball, son?

44:24.371 --> 44:27.833
No, Homer shoots off rockets.
Whoosh and all that st...

44:27.916 --> 44:29.835
Well, rockets are not
exactly my field, son,

44:29.918 --> 44:31.980
but maybe if you work hard enough,
you'll get to college too.

44:32.004 --> 44:33.881
Yeah, on a science fiction
scholarship, maybe.

44:33.964 --> 44:35.049
Jim.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.896
Dear Dr. von Braun,

44:48.979 --> 44:50.981
thank you for
the autographed picture.

44:51.065 --> 44:53.317
It will only further
inspire me to keep working

44:53.400 --> 44:54.818
toward our all-important goal

44:54.902 --> 44:56.820
of entering that
science fair this spring.

45:23.514 --> 45:25.599
We're shootin'
off a rocket today.

45:28.268 --> 45:30.145
I thought you'd
like to come see it.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.564
I gotta catch up on some work.

45:35.526 --> 45:39.196
How come... How come you never
have work when Jim plays football?

45:39.279 --> 45:41.323
You never miss a game.

45:46.662 --> 45:48.205
What time are you gonna do it?

45:49.998 --> 45:51.500
About 4:00.

45:53.502 --> 45:55.421
Uh, I can't promise you...

45:57.714 --> 45:59.174
Somebody pulled
a pillar too close.

46:04.680 --> 46:06.098
Yeah?

46:07.099 --> 46:10.894
Well, thank God for that.
Yeah, right now.

46:13.439 --> 46:14.606
Nobody hurt.

46:21.780 --> 46:23.699
Go, Rocket Boys!

46:27.411 --> 46:28.579
Ten!

46:28.662 --> 46:31.498
Nine, eight, seven,

46:31.582 --> 46:33.417
six, five,

46:33.500 --> 46:35.878
four, three, two,

46:35.961 --> 46:37.421
one, liftoff!

46:53.937 --> 46:55.355
You got it?
Can you see?

46:55.439 --> 46:56.440
Uh, no. Yes.

46:56.523 --> 46:57.566
See it?

46:57.649 --> 46:58.817
Yeah, I see it.

46:58.901 --> 46:59.943
What's the time?

47:00.819 --> 47:02.404
Looks like 12 seconds.

47:02.488 --> 47:04.049
Which one of you
fellas is Homer Hickam?

47:04.072 --> 47:05.157
Um, it's me, sir.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.534
I'm Basil Thorpe with
the Bluefield Telegraph.

47:07.618 --> 47:09.244
Can I ask you a few questions?

47:10.245 --> 47:12.080
Sure.

47:12.956 --> 47:15.167
"The silvery cylinder
burst forth

47:15.250 --> 47:17.336
"in a fiery column
of smoke and flame,

47:17.419 --> 47:20.839
"racing the very wind
as it soared into the sky,

47:20.923 --> 47:23.175
"a messenger of these
Rocket Boys of Big Creek...

47:23.258 --> 47:26.053
"These boys who use
their brains, not brawn,

47:26.136 --> 47:29.515
"who play not football,
but with Apollo's fire."

47:30.641 --> 47:31.683
Hi, Homer.

47:31.767 --> 47:33.769
Hi, Dorothy.

47:33.852 --> 47:35.812
Would you please
sign my newspaper?

47:36.647 --> 47:37.773
Sure.

47:38.315 --> 47:40.567
I just know you're gonna
be really famous someday.

47:43.862 --> 47:48.367
H-O-M-E-R.

47:49.910 --> 47:52.079
Which one of you fellas
is Homer Hickam?

47:53.872 --> 47:55.791
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

47:59.002 --> 48:00.462
What you cost the taxpayers...

48:00.546 --> 48:01.880
What in the world is goin' on?

48:01.964 --> 48:03.465
Miss Riley, this does
not concern you.

48:04.466 --> 48:06.718
You have these
boys in handcuffs.

48:07.010 --> 48:11.181
You have these boys in handcuffs
in a high school, Mr. Turner.

48:11.265 --> 48:14.393
You probably heard about the forest
fire last week over by Welch.

48:14.476 --> 48:15.561
A lot of timber went up.

48:15.644 --> 48:18.146
Mr. Turner, you take these
handcuffs off these boys.

48:18.230 --> 48:20.732
They found a rocket
on the side of the road.

48:20.816 --> 48:22.276
We knew it started
the fire, ma'am.

48:22.359 --> 48:24.236
What we didn't know
is where it came from,

48:24.319 --> 48:25.654
till this morning.

48:26.321 --> 48:28.949
Mr. Hickam, can you account
for all your rockets?

48:30.242 --> 48:31.535
No, sir. I can't.

48:44.506 --> 48:46.925
If you weren't a minor, you'd
be in the state penitentiary.

48:47.050 --> 48:49.720
I know, Dad. I... Homer,
I've been confused by you,

48:49.803 --> 48:52.014
I've been mad as hell at you.

48:52.222 --> 48:55.142
But, boy, it's the first time in
your life I've been ashamed of you.

49:00.564 --> 49:02.274
You couldn't stop, man.
You couldn't!

49:03.358 --> 49:05.360
Get in the car, Homer!

49:05.736 --> 49:07.237
Homer, get in the car.

49:07.696 --> 49:10.282
Idiot! I ought to
goddamn kill ya.

49:16.288 --> 49:19.666
We ain't at the mine now.
This ain't your business.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.044
You get in the car
with Homer, son.

49:23.420 --> 49:26.048
You listen to me,
you drunken son of a bitch.

49:26.506 --> 49:29.384
If that boy's father was
alive, he'd kick your ass.

49:29.760 --> 49:31.720
So I'm gonna have
to do it for him.

49:31.803 --> 49:35.015
If I see him with a bruise,
you get a scar.

49:35.515 --> 49:38.060
If I see him with a limp,
you get crutches!

49:39.770 --> 49:42.898
You hear me?
Do you hear me?

49:47.903 --> 49:49.613
You know, I'm reportin'
you to the Union!

49:50.113 --> 49:52.616
Screw you and your damn Union.

50:08.715 --> 50:13.512
Your father was one of the best
men I ever had workin' for me.

50:19.142 --> 50:20.769
I was lucky to know him.

51:11.820 --> 51:13.196
Come on.

51:15.574 --> 51:17.826
Let's go have some
fun for a change.

51:49.733 --> 51:51.693
They watched us get arrested.

51:51.777 --> 51:54.613
We're practically
ex-convicts.

51:55.447 --> 51:57.073
They'll never dance with us.

51:57.157 --> 52:00.952
Jesus, Quentin. You don't
know anything about women.

52:03.205 --> 52:06.416
I heard she broke up
with that dumb jock.

52:09.503 --> 52:10.962
See you later, Elvis.

52:39.950 --> 52:41.701
Hi, Homer.

52:42.410 --> 52:44.371
Hi, Dorothy.

52:46.414 --> 52:48.625
Jim, look who's here.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.252
Yeah, ain't it past
your bedtime?

52:51.545 --> 52:52.963
Let's go.

52:53.839 --> 52:55.590
Hey, Jim.

52:59.970 --> 53:01.263
Way to go.

53:30.834 --> 53:31.877
Hi, Valentine.

53:35.463 --> 53:37.215
I'm glad you didn't go to jail.

53:52.314 --> 53:55.025
It sure was exciting
watching your rockets go up.

54:36.858 --> 54:40.195
You ever see that movie,
Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman?

54:48.286 --> 54:49.329
Homer!

54:49.412 --> 54:51.998
Homer! Down here! Homer!

54:52.082 --> 54:55.710
Homer! Homer!
What is it?

55:08.848 --> 55:10.809
Mom! Mom!

55:11.851 --> 55:14.062
Mom?

55:15.271 --> 55:17.315
Your father always
has to be the big hero.

55:18.650 --> 55:22.112
I swear to God, if he gets
killed, I won't shed a tear.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.299
It's comin' up!

56:11.119 --> 56:13.079
Who... Who is it?

56:23.339 --> 56:27.260
It's Ike Bykovsky.
Bykovsky.

56:31.973 --> 56:33.475
It's John Hickam!

56:35.310 --> 56:36.394
Dad, Dad!

56:36.478 --> 56:37.729
The cable snapped.

56:37.812 --> 56:39.981
May have fractured his skull!

56:43.860 --> 56:48.364
Get out of the way. Move back, folks!
Let us through here!

56:50.241 --> 56:51.451
Tell you what, Homer.

56:51.534 --> 56:53.203
A dozen men would've died today

56:53.286 --> 56:54.829
if it hadn't been for your dad.

57:40.416 --> 57:41.793
Thank you, Doctor.

57:43.128 --> 57:45.922
Mmm-hmm. Bye-bye.

58:03.648 --> 58:07.777
The, uh, doctor says

58:08.194 --> 58:10.989
there's a chance your dad
could lose his eye.

58:12.657 --> 58:16.411
He has to go to
the hospital in Charleston,

58:17.245 --> 58:19.330
and Olga won't
pay for all of it.

58:21.166 --> 58:24.377
I'm gonna go down to the mine and
ask Jake Mosby to sign me on.

58:25.503 --> 58:27.839
You can't do that, Jim.
You've got school.

58:27.922 --> 58:31.134
Olga owns this house, Mom,
and half the furniture in it.

58:31.926 --> 58:34.262
If you drop out, you'll
lose your scholarship.

58:35.096 --> 58:37.265
Homer, I'm the oldest.
It's my responsibility.

58:37.348 --> 58:38.683
I'll work in the mine.

59:16.471 --> 59:19.140
Here you are, Mr. Turner.
Thank you, Miss Wade.

59:23.269 --> 59:26.314
Mining coal is an honorable
trade, Mr. Hickam.

59:29.984 --> 59:31.527
Nothing to be ashamed of.

59:47.335 --> 59:49.837
Miss Riley! Miss Riley!

01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:19.385
Turn your light on, boy.

01:02:05.932 --> 01:02:08.267
Remember when you
gave me these, John?

01:02:08.351 --> 01:02:10.478
Carbon crystals from the mine.

01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:14.816
Yeah. Honeymoon.
At Myrtle Beach.

01:02:16.651 --> 01:02:20.405
And you said,
"You always wanted diamonds.

01:02:20.822 --> 01:02:24.033
"But these are the best I can do.
I wish they were real."

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:28.037
John, I never wanted diamonds.

01:02:35.044 --> 01:02:36.587
This whole year

01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:39.424
has been pretty rough going
down at the mine.

01:02:41.676 --> 01:02:43.636
Bad tempers

01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:47.348
and a lot of strike talk.

01:02:48.224 --> 01:02:51.269
An accident makes things worse.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.398
In a way, I guess,

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.277
I'm the one who's responsible for
what happened to Mr. Bykovsky.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.154
Listen to me, Homer.

01:03:04.073 --> 01:03:05.867
Last month,

01:03:06.534 --> 01:03:10.288
I gave Ike the chance to go
back to the machine shop,

01:03:10.872 --> 01:03:12.290
and he turned it down.

01:03:12.874 --> 01:03:16.210
Yeah, he stayed in the mine
'cause the money was better.

01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:18.963
That was his decision.

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:21.507
You understand me?

01:03:22.717 --> 01:03:24.177
Yes, sir.

01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:31.601
Well, is mining coal as terrible
as you figured it'd be?

01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:33.436
I guess not.

01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:37.773
But almost.

01:03:58.586 --> 01:04:02.465
Everybody says to say hi.
Michael and Billy.

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:04.509
Valentine Carmina.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.345
How about Miss Riley?

01:04:07.428 --> 01:04:11.516
She ain't been around much. She got
some new boyfriend over in Welch.

01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:16.103
So, uh, what's it like
down there?

01:04:20.608 --> 01:04:22.401
You get used to it
after a while.

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:26.656
Besides, shoveling coal
has got its advantages.

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:28.908
Check this out.

01:04:29.951 --> 01:04:33.788
Man, no wonder my stepdad
can slug me so good.

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:36.207
After a month down there, you'd
be able to knock him out.

01:04:39.335 --> 01:04:40.920
Well, I ain't in no hurry.

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:54.016
See ya all later.
See ya, man.

01:04:54.559 --> 01:04:56.602
See ya, Homer.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.565
In Christ's name,
we pray. Amen.

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:02.567
Amen.

01:05:07.196 --> 01:05:09.865
We appreciate the sacrifice
you made here, Homer.

01:05:10.658 --> 01:05:12.827
But pretty soon,
you'll be able to go back

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.037
and finish up the school year.

01:05:16.664 --> 01:05:18.583
I'm not going back to school.

01:05:19.542 --> 01:05:21.294
A few weeks left in the term,

01:05:21.836 --> 01:05:22.920
I'll just stay put.

01:05:23.004 --> 01:05:25.381
Well, I think you ought
to finish high school.

01:05:29.302 --> 01:05:30.970
Well, tell him, John.

01:05:32.888 --> 01:05:34.724
Homer's not a boy anymore.

01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:40.021
I don't think I can
tell him anything.

01:05:53.534 --> 01:05:55.620
John, is the cutoff was not

01:05:55.703 --> 01:05:57.705
done proper
according to contract.

01:05:57.788 --> 01:05:59.707
Well, the company
did what it had to do.

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.751
Well, you know the Union
won't put up with it.

01:06:02.335 --> 01:06:05.838
Just give it a rest, Jake.
It's my first day back.

01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:14.722
Hey, Lenny, how's he doing?

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:17.183
He's a chip off
the old block, John.

01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:18.434
It's good to have you back.

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:19.644
Thank you.

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:29.403
Hi. I'm headed toward the face.
You wanna come along?

01:06:33.574 --> 01:06:35.868
Even though I don't
have that piece of paper,

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:38.746
the thing from college,
they listen to me.

01:06:40.456 --> 01:06:41.749
You know why?

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:44.251
'Cause you know
more than they do.

01:06:44.335 --> 01:06:47.463
You bet your life
I do. Homer,

01:06:48.547 --> 01:06:51.509
I know the mine
like I know a man.

01:06:51.592 --> 01:06:55.471
Heck, I can take
one look around here...

01:06:57.598 --> 01:06:59.433
Are you all right?

01:06:59.934 --> 01:07:02.103
Yeah, I'm not afraid
of a little coal dust.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.231
Hell, Homer,
I was born for this.

01:07:05.314 --> 01:07:08.651
I guess it shouldn't surprise
me that you were too.

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:11.278
Let's go watch
'em shoot some coal.

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:23.457
Elsie, hold dinner
for a while, will you?

01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:25.126
I have to make a call.

01:07:31.632 --> 01:07:33.467
Homer,

01:07:35.177 --> 01:07:38.222
I was in the store today,
and I heard some talk.

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:55.239
Boy, it's sure hard to keep a
secret in this town, isn't it?

01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:57.533
But I guess I did
a pretty good job.

01:07:58.534 --> 01:08:00.494
You know, there's a rumor
going around that I been

01:08:00.578 --> 01:08:02.830
sneaking off to Welch
to see some beau.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:05.207
I wish that rumor'd been true.

01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:06.333
Yeah.

01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:09.086
They told me Hodgkin's
can go into remission,

01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:11.839
so I might have some time.

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:13.966
Is there anything
I can do, Miss Riley?

01:08:14.884 --> 01:08:17.011
You can accept my apology.

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:19.596
For what?

01:08:20.014 --> 01:08:22.308
My life's work is teaching.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:26.395
And I believed that if you
boys won that science fair,

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:28.439
got scholarships,
went off and did

01:08:28.522 --> 01:08:30.357
something great with your lives,

01:08:31.358 --> 01:08:33.861
somehow my life would have
counted for something.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.990
Homer.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:42.620
You know what?

01:08:43.412 --> 01:08:47.374
Sometimes you really can't listen
to what anybody else says.

01:08:47.917 --> 01:08:50.085
You just gotta listen inside.

01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:54.048
You're not supposed
to end up in those mines.

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:58.010
You know why? 'Cause I think
you made other plans.

01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:01.055
I want you to know something.

01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:05.142
I'm proud of you. I am.

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.728
Whatever you choose.

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:53.292
Excuse me, ma'am,
is Quentin home?

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:01.592
Quentin.

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:09.725
Homer, you figured this
equation out by yourself?

01:11:09.808 --> 01:11:13.270
Well, if I did the math right.
It proves that you can't...

01:11:13.354 --> 01:11:15.105
It proves we didn't
start that fire!

01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:16.899
Quentin, what're you doin'?

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.651
Now, the Auk XIII
was the only one

01:11:18.734 --> 01:11:20.361
that we couldn't find that day.

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:22.905
And our best guess for fall
time with the Auk XIII,

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:25.950
which is exactly identical,
was about 14 seconds.

01:11:26.283 --> 01:11:28.410
If you help me with
the trig part, Quentin,

01:11:28.494 --> 01:11:29.721
we should be able
to make a good guess

01:11:29.745 --> 01:11:30.996
where that rocket landed.

01:11:45.761 --> 01:11:48.555
Six thousand, three hundred
and twenty-eight feet.

01:11:49.723 --> 01:11:51.558
1.2 miles.

01:11:53.936 --> 01:11:55.562
Homer?
Yeah?

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:03.237
Are you gonna tell Roy Lee
and O'Dell where I live?

01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:06.824
It wouldn't matter if you lived
in the governor's mansion,

01:12:08.117 --> 01:12:10.119
they'd still think you're weird.

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:17.876
I'll see you at dawn.

01:12:19.294 --> 01:12:20.963
Don't you have
to go to the mine?

01:12:22.172 --> 01:12:23.674
I don't work there anymore.

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:41.608
One.

01:12:48.949 --> 01:12:50.784
Two.

01:13:00.044 --> 01:13:01.670
Ninety-nine.

01:13:05.924 --> 01:13:07.342
A hundred seven.

01:13:27.279 --> 01:13:29.031
One hundred and twenty-six.

01:13:30.616 --> 01:13:32.659
That's 6,300 feet.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.329
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

01:14:00.354 --> 01:14:02.940
What'd we do wrong?

01:14:03.023 --> 01:14:06.360
I don't know. I...
I'll check the math again.

01:14:16.537 --> 01:14:18.163
Was there a wind that day?

01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:20.749
I... I don't remember.

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:22.417
'Cause if there was,

01:14:23.043 --> 01:14:25.796
the wind probably
came from the west,

01:14:25.879 --> 01:14:28.132
which means that it would've
pushed the rocket...

01:14:31.093 --> 01:14:32.636
Right there.

01:14:37.057 --> 01:14:38.559
Prodigious.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.603
Associated...

01:14:47.693 --> 01:14:50.404
Mr. Hayes, where you
off to in such a hurry?

01:14:51.989 --> 01:14:54.241
Okay, everybody,
back in your seats.

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:56.493
Miss Stanton,
Miss Blue, let's go,

01:14:56.577 --> 01:14:58.245
back in your seats.
Mr. Hancock.

01:14:59.663 --> 01:15:01.915
That goes for you
too, Mr. Wilson.

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:08.046
Miss Riley, what's
going on in here?

01:15:08.589 --> 01:15:10.924
They didn't start
that fire, Mr. Turner.

01:15:11.717 --> 01:15:14.052
In the first place, you are not
a member of this classroom.

01:15:14.595 --> 01:15:16.180
Neither are you, Mr. Turner.

01:15:17.347 --> 01:15:18.825
Why don't you let
the boy defend himself?

01:15:18.849 --> 01:15:22.769
And in the second place,
this rocket proves nothing.

01:15:23.312 --> 01:15:25.939
You've already admitted having
lost a number of your rockets.

01:15:26.023 --> 01:15:28.025
You cannot prove conclusively

01:15:28.108 --> 01:15:30.277
that another one of them
didn't start that fire.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.612
Yes, I can.

01:15:38.577 --> 01:15:41.163
Are we to conclude, Mr. Hickam,
that since leaving school,

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:43.246
you've not only become an
expert in rocket science,

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:44.750
but in the field
of trigonometry?

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:46.603
I didn't say that I was a rock...
Obviously, you learned more

01:15:46.627 --> 01:15:48.428
in the coal mines than
you did in high school.

01:15:49.713 --> 01:15:53.175
Let the boy talk.
Go ahead, Homer.

01:15:53.258 --> 01:15:57.346
Now, that fire was near Welch, just
under three miles from our launchpad.

01:15:58.222 --> 01:16:00.766
And at the time of the fire,
the best that we could do

01:16:00.849 --> 01:16:02.100
was 1.2 miles,

01:16:02.935 --> 01:16:05.479
which is exactly where we found
that rocket, Mr. Turner.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:09.608
See, Mr. Turner, that rocket fell
for about 14 seconds, which means

01:16:09.691 --> 01:16:12.319
that it flew to an altitude
of 3,000 feet.

01:16:12.653 --> 01:16:13.946
According to the equation,

01:16:14.029 --> 01:16:18.742
"S" equals one-half "A"
"T" squared,

01:16:18.825 --> 01:16:22.204
where "S" is the altitude, "A"
is the gravity constant or 32,

01:16:22.287 --> 01:16:24.727
and "T" is the time it took for
that rocket to come back down.

01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:26.309
Velocity equals
acceleration times time.

01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:27.668
Get him, Homer, get him.

01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:29.654
Are you following
this, Mr. Turner?

01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:33.006
All right, we're all
duly impressed.

01:16:33.799 --> 01:16:36.969
But do you mind telling me, if you
did not start that fire, who did?

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.181
What is it?

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:46.353
Whatever it is, it's ingenious.
The fins are spring-loaded.

01:16:47.104 --> 01:16:48.522
That isn't a rocket at all.

01:16:48.939 --> 01:16:51.024
It's an aeronautical flare.

01:16:53.402 --> 01:16:55.279
There's an airport
here in Welch.

01:16:55.362 --> 01:16:57.197
It's right above
where the fire started.

01:17:06.832 --> 01:17:08.917
Mr. Hickam, report
to my office

01:17:09.001 --> 01:17:10.335
as soon as we return to school.

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:14.756
You do intend to enter the
county science fair, do you not?

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.216
Yes, sir, we do.

01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:19.261
Well, if you intend
to represent Big Creek,

01:17:19.928 --> 01:17:22.472
you're gonna have to be enrolled
as a student at Big Creek.

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:27.894
"Prodigenous."

01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:32.208
Do you think
you can draw well enough

01:17:32.232 --> 01:17:33.392
so Mr. Bolden could build it?

01:17:33.442 --> 01:17:35.277
Yep. Let me see.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.654
Yeah.
Hey, Homer.

01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:39.489
Hi, Dad.

01:17:39.573 --> 01:17:41.325
What's this stuff doin' here?

01:17:41.408 --> 01:17:43.160
Mr. Hickam,
we didn't start the fire.

01:17:43.243 --> 01:17:44.523
The troopers gave it back to us.

01:17:44.578 --> 01:17:45.763
Yeah, it wasn't even
one of our rockets.

01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:46.947
It was an aeronautical flare.

01:17:47.164 --> 01:17:48.832
Y'all go on home now.

01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:51.752
Yes, sir.

01:18:07.934 --> 01:18:10.937
This the reason you
skipped work today?

01:18:11.021 --> 01:18:12.022
Yes, sir.

01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:18.528
I thought you put all this
nonsense behind you, Homer.

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.407
I thought you weren't gonna be doin' it...
Dad, it isn't nonsense.

01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:24.326
I... I don't wanna
argue with you.

01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:25.744
Look, son,

01:18:27.162 --> 01:18:28.705
I can't even begin to tell you

01:18:28.789 --> 01:18:30.540
how proud of you
I've been these past weeks.

01:18:30.624 --> 01:18:34.628
I mean, you've just been doin'
a hell of a job in that mine.

01:18:35.921 --> 01:18:38.757
You keep goin', you're
gonna have my job someday.

01:18:39.383 --> 01:18:41.051
Everybody says so.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:45.806
You got any idea how proud
that would make me?

01:18:47.641 --> 01:18:49.351
Dad, but I...

01:18:49.434 --> 01:18:52.312
I guess what I'm
sayin' is, is that

01:18:52.396 --> 01:18:54.981
if this rocket stuff is so
important to you,

01:18:55.774 --> 01:18:58.652
then so be it,
as long as you're careful.

01:18:59.319 --> 01:19:01.321
Guess there's worse
hobbies you could have.

01:19:02.656 --> 01:19:05.867
But skippin' work,
that's out of line.

01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:07.828
And you gotta know that.

01:19:08.662 --> 01:19:11.790
So let's go and get
you right with Jake.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:15.001
Tell him you'll work
the hoot owl shift tonight.

01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:16.711
No.

01:19:20.715 --> 01:19:23.635
The coal mine's your life.
It's not mine.

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:31.768
I'm never going
down there again.

01:19:39.234 --> 01:19:41.570
I wanna go into space.

01:20:05.051 --> 01:20:08.763
Home Hickam,
Roy Lee Cook, Quentin Wilson,

01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:11.016
and Sherman O'Dell
of Big Creek High,

01:20:11.099 --> 01:20:12.476
for their ingenious display

01:20:12.559 --> 01:20:14.144
of amateur
rocket-building techniques.

01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:36.583
I can't believe we beat the
kid with the robot dog.

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:39.628
And I thought the see-through
ear was gonna win.

01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:42.839
I got Miss Wade workin'
on your travel arrangements,

01:20:42.923 --> 01:20:46.510
so you boys are gonna have to
decide who's goin' to Indianapolis.

01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:48.803
We're all goin'.

01:20:48.887 --> 01:20:49.887
Yeah.

01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:53.308
Son, I wish you could, but we can't
afford to send all four of you.

01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:56.186
Only one. Let me know
what you decide.

01:20:56.269 --> 01:20:57.549
I'm gonna have
to know by Friday.

01:20:58.146 --> 01:20:59.856
You boys did a fine job today.

01:21:12.369 --> 01:21:15.372
I need to borrow a suitcase, and I'm
gonna need you guys' addresses,

01:21:15.455 --> 01:21:17.082
because I'm gonna
write some postcards.

01:21:17.165 --> 01:21:18.708
Oh, you shut up, Roy Lee.

01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:21.545
Come on, you dope.
You know, you're goin', Homer.

01:21:21.628 --> 01:21:23.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:23.964 --> 01:21:26.091
Say hello to the outside world
for us.

01:21:26.967 --> 01:21:28.176
Do we know what we want?

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.302
Yeah!

01:21:29.386 --> 01:21:31.304
- Are we gettin' it?
- No!

01:21:31.388 --> 01:21:35.225
All right! All in favor of goin'
out on strike, say "Aye"!

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:36.434
Aye!

01:21:36.518 --> 01:21:37.769
All right, let's go!

01:21:39.479 --> 01:21:42.065
All right, settle down!
Let's go!

01:21:42.148 --> 01:21:45.777
Strike! Strike! Strike!

01:22:03.962 --> 01:22:05.882
Well, they sure are
gettin' themselves worked up.

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:07.650
Everybody's sayin' this
one's gonna be a long one.

01:22:07.674 --> 01:22:10.385
And it will, if I have
anything to say about it.

01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:12.804
Ungrateful sons of bitches.

01:22:12.887 --> 01:22:15.098
Mom, have you seen
the big green suitcase?

01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:16.600
Did you look in the attic?

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:18.393
Yes, ma'am.

01:22:18.476 --> 01:22:21.021
Well, I don't know. John, you
know where the suitcase is?

01:22:23.398 --> 01:22:26.985
How the hell should I know
where the suitcase is?

01:22:27.819 --> 01:22:29.362
I don't know, sug.

01:22:44.044 --> 01:22:45.420
John!

01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:47.589
Y'all stay inside!

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:54.054
Earl Lee!

01:22:54.512 --> 01:22:55.873
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

01:22:55.889 --> 01:22:57.766
Oh, don't be a damn fool.

01:22:58.058 --> 01:23:00.810
All right, well,
what are we gonna do?

01:23:00.894 --> 01:23:02.228
Nothin'.

01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:06.483
Drunken bastard couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn.

01:23:06.608 --> 01:23:08.711
He tried to kill you, Dad. Yeah,
Dad, you can't just stand...

01:23:08.735 --> 01:23:11.488
Hey, hey, don't
trouble yourself, Homer.

01:23:11.905 --> 01:23:14.407
You got more important
things to worry about.

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:18.119
Just go look for your suitcase.

01:23:22.082 --> 01:23:23.458
Forget about it, Homer.

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:27.128
Shut up, Jim!

01:23:28.505 --> 01:23:30.465
Listen, I'm sorry
about what's goin' on

01:23:30.548 --> 01:23:32.384
around here,
but it isn't my fault!

01:23:32.467 --> 01:23:33.802
What do you want from me anyway?

01:23:33.885 --> 01:23:35.136
Better watch yourself, Homer!

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.722
If I win at Indianapolis,
maybe I can go to college,

01:23:37.806 --> 01:23:39.849
maybe even get a job
at Cape Canaveral!

01:23:39.933 --> 01:23:43.186
There's nothing here for me!
The town is dyin'!

01:23:43.269 --> 01:23:45.980
The mine is dyin'! Everybody
knows it here but you!

01:23:46.064 --> 01:23:48.566
You wanna get out of here
so bad, then go! Go!

01:23:48.650 --> 01:23:50.318
Yeah, I'll go!
Yeah, I'll go!

01:23:50.402 --> 01:23:51.695
Go, go!
I'll go!

01:23:51.778 --> 01:23:55.699
And I'll be gone forever!
I won't even look back!

01:24:40.493 --> 01:24:42.412
Welcome to Indianapolis.

01:24:42.495 --> 01:24:44.080
Visitors to the fair
will include

01:24:44.164 --> 01:24:45.623
prominent members
of every branch

01:24:45.707 --> 01:24:47.917
of the national
scientific community.

01:24:48.001 --> 01:24:50.754
The fair will be open to the
public over the next two days.

01:24:50.837 --> 01:24:54.090
The following day, the judges will
arrive to select the winners.

01:24:55.592 --> 01:24:56.832
By timing the rocket's descent,

01:24:56.885 --> 01:25:00.096
we would be able to figure out
just how high the rocket flew.

01:25:03.558 --> 01:25:05.518
Would you like to see?
This is a de Laval nozzle.

01:25:06.478 --> 01:25:08.688
Do any of y'all know
what a de Laval noz...

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:20.366
Two, please.

01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:22.386
The judges always go for the
most expensive exhibits.

01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:24.287
That guy with
the biosphere's gonna win.

01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:28.166
I don't think so. My money's on
the kid with the rocket display.

01:25:28.249 --> 01:25:31.377
Have you seen it yet?
It's really cool.

01:25:36.007 --> 01:25:38.343
Mr. Owens,
to the security office.

01:25:38.426 --> 01:25:41.179
Mr. Owens, to
the security office, please.

01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:52.310
It's not like we got a hell
of a lot of time, Roy Lee.

01:25:52.315 --> 01:25:53.817
The judging is tomorrow.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:55.819
There's nothin'
we can do without Mr. Bolden.

01:25:55.902 --> 01:25:58.071
And he can't get anywhere
near the machine shop.

01:25:58.655 --> 01:26:01.157
They even took my picture
of Dr. von Braun.

01:26:02.534 --> 01:26:04.077
They stole everything.

01:26:13.253 --> 01:26:15.380
Leon, what
are you doing back here?

01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:17.590
You know you shouldn't
be seen back here.

01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:20.468
I know, Elsie,
but Homer's in trouble.

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:39.320
Elsie, I don't have the power
to settle this strike.

01:26:39.779 --> 01:26:42.699
The bosses listen to you.
They'll do what you tell 'em.

01:26:42.782 --> 01:26:45.201
I am not gonna crawl on my belly

01:26:45.285 --> 01:26:48.371
in front of those
miserable Union rats.

01:26:48.955 --> 01:26:51.958
Is that what this is about, John?
Is this about your pride?

01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:54.210
No, it's about
what's best for Coalwood.

01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:58.423
If this mine doesn't produce,
then the town dies.

01:26:59.382 --> 01:27:01.968
Think the Union gives
a good damn about that?

01:27:03.344 --> 01:27:06.222
They're nothin' but a bunch of
greedy sons of bitches that...

01:27:06.306 --> 01:27:07.765
Shut up, John.
Just shut up.

01:27:08.725 --> 01:27:11.394
Homer once said you love the
mine more than your own family.

01:27:11.477 --> 01:27:13.678
And I stuck up for you 'cause
I didn't wanna believe it.

01:27:14.022 --> 01:27:16.382
Homer has gotten a lot of help
from the people in this town.

01:27:16.816 --> 01:27:18.401
They've helped him
build his rockets,

01:27:18.484 --> 01:27:20.087
they've gone out there
and watched him fly 'em.

01:27:20.111 --> 01:27:23.865
But not you, John. You never showed up.
Not even once.

01:27:24.532 --> 01:27:26.451
Now, I'm not asking
you to believe in him,

01:27:26.701 --> 01:27:29.370
but he's your son,
for God's sake, John.

01:27:29.454 --> 01:27:31.539
And I am askin' you to help him.

01:27:32.624 --> 01:27:34.000
If you don't, I'll leave you.

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:37.354
I'll find work. I'll do whatever
it takes to get away from here.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:40.632
I'll live in a tree to get away from you.
Don't you think I won't.

01:27:45.011 --> 01:27:46.346
Where would you go?

01:27:49.098 --> 01:27:50.558
Myrtle Beach.

01:28:04.572 --> 01:28:06.950
I guess we all know
this isn't gonna fix things,

01:28:07.033 --> 01:28:09.202
uh, at least not for long.

01:28:10.036 --> 01:28:12.288
We know you did
what you could for us.

01:28:13.164 --> 01:28:14.499
Jake.
Thanks.

01:28:15.875 --> 01:28:16.876
Leon.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.294
Yes, John.

01:28:20.213 --> 01:28:22.090
Don't you have some work to do?

01:28:35.895 --> 01:28:37.438
It's packed and shipped
and on its way.

01:28:37.522 --> 01:28:39.065
Be at the bus station,
8:00 a.m.

01:28:39.691 --> 01:28:40.772
Okay, Mom, but how'd you...

01:28:40.817 --> 01:28:41.818
Your father, Homer.

01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:43.277
It was your father.

01:28:43.361 --> 01:28:44.445
Give 'em hell, Homer!

01:28:49.492 --> 01:28:50.535
Good luck, sweetie.

01:28:50.618 --> 01:28:51.619
Bye.

01:29:05.967 --> 01:29:07.385
Thanks, Dad.

01:29:20.648 --> 01:29:22.191
When the rocket
propellant burns,

01:29:22.275 --> 01:29:23.735
it produces a river of gas

01:29:23.818 --> 01:29:26.738
which flows through the
convergent section of the nozzle.

01:29:26.821 --> 01:29:28.823
If the river continues
through the nozzle,

01:29:28.906 --> 01:29:31.034
or through the throat
at less than sonic speed,

01:29:31.117 --> 01:29:33.411
that is to say,
less than the speed of sound,

01:29:33.494 --> 01:29:36.789
it becomes compact in the...
Compacted in the divergent section,

01:29:36.873 --> 01:29:38.750
bound in turmoil
and inefficient.

01:29:38.833 --> 01:29:43.046
Lyle Wells and Jean Cooper, Schrader
High School, McMinnville, Oregon.

01:30:01.856 --> 01:30:04.400
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the big moment.

01:30:06.319 --> 01:30:09.697
The highest scholastic
achievement award for Science.

01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:13.117
The national science fair
first prize gold medal

01:30:13.201 --> 01:30:15.578
goes to Homer Hickam,

01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:18.915
Quentin Wilson, Roy Lee Cook
and Sherman O'Dell,

01:30:18.998 --> 01:30:22.668
Big Creek High School, McDowell
County, West Virginia.

01:30:54.951 --> 01:30:56.619
Tom Webster of
Virginia State College.

01:30:56.702 --> 01:30:58.371
I wanna talk to you
about a scholarship.

01:30:58.454 --> 01:31:00.206
Jack Palmer, Virginia Tech.

01:31:00.289 --> 01:31:02.917
We got the best science program
in the state, buddy, okay?

01:31:03.626 --> 01:31:05.878
Congratulations, son.
Good luck to you.

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:10.550
What did he say to you?

01:31:10.633 --> 01:31:11.801
What did who say?

01:31:12.385 --> 01:31:16.597
Von Braun. That was Wernher von Braun.
You just shook his hand.

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:35.992
Oh, Homer, I'm so proud of you.

01:31:36.075 --> 01:31:37.118
Thanks, Mom.

01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:40.663
He's not here, hon.

01:31:42.248 --> 01:31:43.958
Where's Miss Riley?

01:32:01.225 --> 01:32:02.894
Hello, Miss Riley.

01:32:05.438 --> 01:32:06.772
Hi, Homer.

01:32:07.648 --> 01:32:08.941
Hi.
Hi.

01:32:12.111 --> 01:32:15.198
Oh! You did it!

01:32:15.281 --> 01:32:16.949
I knew you would.

01:32:18.534 --> 01:32:20.536
The Rocket Boys
are goin' to college.

01:32:22.371 --> 01:32:24.415
We all got scholarships.

01:32:26.167 --> 01:32:27.835
And you know what?

01:32:29.128 --> 01:32:31.797
From now on, every school year,

01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:34.717
I'm gonna brag to
all my new students

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.970
about how I taught Homer
Hickam and the Rocket Boys.

01:32:39.138 --> 01:32:40.932
Maybe one day,

01:32:41.557 --> 01:32:44.852
one of them'll feel like
they can do what y'all did.

01:32:57.448 --> 01:33:00.117
You know, just,
stuff like that takes time.

01:33:06.123 --> 01:33:07.875
Will you let me out?

01:33:15.049 --> 01:33:17.635
I don't know what they
were doin', charging Olga

01:33:17.718 --> 01:33:19.053
for that kind of a pump.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.931
Hell, why don't we
salvage something up here?

01:33:22.014 --> 01:33:23.057
Hey, Dad. Hi.

01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.140
Hello, Homer.

01:33:24.183 --> 01:33:25.977
I just wanted
to tell you how much

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:27.770
I appreciate what
you did for me.

01:33:27.853 --> 01:33:31.190
I know it wasn't easy
for you, so thank you.

01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:34.694
And we're shootin' off
our last rocket today at 5:00,

01:33:34.777 --> 01:33:36.046
so if you'd like
to come see it...

01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:37.405
I got a lot of work to do.

01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:41.534
All right. Well, I just
thought I'd ask.

01:33:44.662 --> 01:33:46.747
Hear you met your big hero.

01:33:49.959 --> 01:33:51.711
Didn't even know it.

01:33:58.551 --> 01:33:59.635
Look,

01:34:00.219 --> 01:34:03.055
I know you and me don't exactly
see eye to eye on certain things.

01:34:03.556 --> 01:34:06.892
I mean, man, we don't see eye
to eye on just about anything.

01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:10.162
But, Dad, I come to
believe that I got it

01:34:10.187 --> 01:34:12.064
in me to be somebody
in this world.

01:34:13.024 --> 01:34:15.568
And it's not because I'm so
different from you either.

01:34:15.651 --> 01:34:17.653
It's 'cause I'm the same.

01:34:18.654 --> 01:34:21.574
You know, I can be just as
hardheaded and just as tough.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.494
I only hope I can be
as good a man as you are.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.333
I mean, sure,

01:34:30.416 --> 01:34:32.835
Dr. Von Braun's
a great scientist,

01:34:34.086 --> 01:34:35.921
but he isn't my hero.

01:35:38.317 --> 01:35:39.568
It's our last rocket.

01:35:39.652 --> 01:35:40.903
Yeah, let's do it.

01:35:42.488 --> 01:35:44.365
Wire it up for me, will ya?
Yeah.

01:35:44.448 --> 01:35:45.741
I gotta do something.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.578
Hi, Homer.
Hi.

01:35:49.662 --> 01:35:51.455
Congratulations on winning
the science fair.

01:35:52.665 --> 01:35:53.934
It's gotta be
the most exciting thing

01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:55.793
that's ever happened around here.
Yeah.

01:35:55.876 --> 01:35:59.422
Um, I was thinking, Homer, if...
If you've got some time...

01:35:59.505 --> 01:36:01.549
Excuse me, Dorothy. Hi.

01:36:01.632 --> 01:36:02.758
Hi.

01:36:07.096 --> 01:36:09.473
Good luck.
Thanks.

01:36:10.724 --> 01:36:13.018
Hey, everybody, can we
have your attention, please?

01:36:13.102 --> 01:36:14.770
Come on, Homer, let her fly!

01:36:14.854 --> 01:36:16.772
We're gonna launch
the rocket in a minute,

01:36:16.856 --> 01:36:18.691
but we'd like to
say thank you first.

01:36:19.275 --> 01:36:22.486
If it wasn't for y'all, we'd never
have gotten into any science fair.

01:36:23.487 --> 01:36:24.727
We'd probably never have gotten

01:36:24.738 --> 01:36:26.115
past blowin' up my mom's fence.

01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:29.076
But we did,

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.537
because of your
help and support.

01:36:32.621 --> 01:36:34.832
And this is for Coalwood.

01:36:40.045 --> 01:36:43.174
There are a few people who
believed in us even before we did.

01:36:43.841 --> 01:36:46.010
We'd like to dedicate
this rocket to them.

01:36:47.511 --> 01:36:49.096
To Ike Bykovsky.

01:36:53.142 --> 01:36:55.519
To Mr. Bolden,
who helped us so much.

01:36:58.647 --> 01:37:01.192
To the person who
first inspired us,

01:37:01.734 --> 01:37:03.736
our teacher, Miss Riley.

01:37:06.155 --> 01:37:11.410
And, finally, I'd like to dedicate
this rocket to my mom and to...

01:37:16.916 --> 01:37:18.083
My dad.

01:37:33.265 --> 01:37:36.519
You know, it, uh, won't fly unless
somebody pushes the button.

01:37:40.773 --> 01:37:42.900
It's yours, if you want it.

01:38:05.631 --> 01:38:07.716
Ten, nine...

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.051
Eight,

01:38:09.134 --> 01:38:11.720
seven, six, five,

01:38:11.804 --> 01:38:15.307
four, three, two, one.

01:38:32.157 --> 01:38:35.744
Look at it go, Homer.
