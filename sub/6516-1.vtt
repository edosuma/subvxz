04:00.906 --> 04:05.817
- I got Mr Raymond's cigarettes.
- Go on in the back.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.054
Kid, give me my cigarettes.

04:35.274 --> 04:37.397
Wait, wait, wait! Hold it.

04:37.609 --> 04:42.355
What's this kid doing here?
Get out before I kick your little ass.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.067
You ain't kicking shit.

04:46.493 --> 04:50.361
Don't worry about him.
He runs errands for me.

04:50.581 --> 04:55.207
I don't care who he is or what he does.
Kids bring me bad luck.

04:55.419 --> 04:59.997
The bet is fading. Stop talking and shoot
the dice. You're fucking up the game.

05:00.215 --> 05:06.051
I ain't shooting shit. I told you kids
bring me bad luck. I can't stand them.

05:06.263 --> 05:10.095
Now, get the fuck out of here
before I kick your ass.

05:10.309 --> 05:14.176
You ain't whupping shit. Shoot the dice,
you snaggle-toothed motherfucker.

05:19.109 --> 05:21.232
All right, l'm going to shoot.

05:21.445 --> 05:25.193
But l'd better not crap.
That's all I know, l'd better not crap.

05:25.407 --> 05:30.947
Come on, 6. l've been waiting all night.
Baby needs shoes, new clothes.

05:31.163 --> 05:35.659
- And you need some teeth.
- Shoot the goddamn dice, man!

05:35.876 --> 05:41.546
l'm going to shoot the damn dice.
l'll send every one of you home broke.

05:42.758 --> 05:45.878
Come on, 6, with your bad ass.
Come on!

05:46.095 --> 05:48.087
Craps!

05:53.394 --> 05:57.806
What are you doing with this kid in here?
Didn't I say they're bad luck?

05:58.023 --> 06:02.650
What's that sign say? 'Ray's Place'.
That's me. This is my place.

06:02.861 --> 06:05.187
I have in here whoever I want.

06:05.406 --> 06:09.071
You lost. So pass the dice,
or buy them from this motherfucker.

06:09.284 --> 06:12.202
- And I ain't selling.
- I ain't buying.

06:12.413 --> 06:17.240
l'm going to shoot this again and
you're going to get this kid out of here.

06:17.459 --> 06:22.038
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Man, look, you shot, you lost.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.126
We'd have paid you
if you won, but you lost.

06:25.342 --> 06:28.260
Now, go home and brush that tooth.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.129
You think that's funny?

06:33.350 --> 06:37.134
I told you
I couldn't stand kids in the room.

06:37.354 --> 06:40.770
- They're bad luck. You wouldn't listen.
- l'm listening.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.311
Listen to this.

06:42.526 --> 06:47.733
I want back all the money
I lost tonight plus what you took in.

06:47.948 --> 06:51.993
Do you understand me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch?

06:52.202 --> 06:57.789
Tell that old frog-faced dude to go
out there and bring back the money.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.998
Tell him, or l'll stick your ass,
and l'm going to stick him,

07:02.212 --> 07:08.132
and l'll stick this little Yankee ass,
bad-luck motherfucker standing here.

07:08.343 --> 07:12.175
Then you'll have to stick us
because I ain't giving you shit.

07:12.389 --> 07:16.553
Wait! Before you do,
I just want to tell you one thing.

07:16.769 --> 07:21.062
Tell me what, punk?
What the fuck do you want to tell me?

07:21.273 --> 07:23.432
What do you want to tell me?

07:23.651 --> 07:27.019
- It slips my mind.
- Slips your mind?

07:32.034 --> 07:34.073
Holy shit!

07:36.955 --> 07:41.416
Goddamn. I guess
he does have bad luck with kids.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.001
He was going to stab us, so I shot him.

07:47.758 --> 07:53.214
Bennie, Slim, Moses, would you help
get this dead motherfucker out, please?

08:03.232 --> 08:07.894
The game's over for tonight.
l'm taking this boy home to his mother.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.522
My mama's dead.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.859
- Well, your daddy.
- My father's dead, too.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.864
- Did you kill them?
- No, they're just dead.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.706
Give me that pistol.
Where do you stay?

08:22.918 --> 08:26.785
- I don't live nowhere.
- You can stay with me for a while.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.759
I wouldn't trust him in the house.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.253
- He's all right. Give me five!
- I ain't giving you shit.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.804
He's one hell of a motherfucker.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.595
Come on.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.563
- l'll clean up.
- Please.

08:43.772 --> 08:46.809
So you shot him.
How about some ice cream?

08:53.741 --> 08:56.825
CLUB SUGAR RA Y

09:39.578 --> 09:42.781
- Ray, look. Tommy is coming.
- Where?

09:42.998 --> 09:45.999
- Over there.
- Oh, shit!

09:47.378 --> 09:52.289
- Mr Smalls, good evening.
- My man. How are you doing, brother?

09:52.508 --> 09:55.711
- Thank you.
- Do you want me to kick his ass?

09:55.928 --> 09:59.463
No, don't kick his ass.
Thank you, Roberto.

10:00.849 --> 10:04.894
It looks like the competition
has stopped by to check us out.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.726
That's Tommy Smalls.
He runs the Pitty Pat Club.

10:09.942 --> 10:15.398
I know that's Smalls, but who's
that girl with him? She is beautiful.

10:15.614 --> 10:18.532
Wait a minute.
Don't mess around with her.

10:18.742 --> 10:24.116
That's the mistress of a famous
gangster named Bugsy Calhoune.

10:24.331 --> 10:27.000
That's Calhoune's girl?

10:27.209 --> 10:29.249
I heard about her.

10:29.461 --> 10:33.541
What would a woman that fine
want with a fat, nasty, greasy,

10:33.757 --> 10:36.213
fat, stank, bloated,

10:36.427 --> 10:41.338
cheesy-backed, twelve-sandwich-eating
bastard like him?

10:41.557 --> 10:45.305
Maybe she likes fat guys.
Want to check them out?

10:45.519 --> 10:46.847
I think I will.

10:47.062 --> 10:52.519
Just check her out. I mean, don't fuck
with her. You'll get in trouble.

11:10.002 --> 11:15.589
- May I be of some assistance?
- No, no. Not at all, Mr Quick.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.757
We're just enjoying the night out.

11:22.473 --> 11:28.096
- You boys ain't open tonight?
- We wanted a change of atmosphere.

11:28.312 --> 11:32.392
l'm sure you understand that,
Mr Quick.

11:34.651 --> 11:36.893
My name is Quick.

11:37.112 --> 11:40.232
My name is Dominique La Rue,
Mr Quick.

11:40.449 --> 11:44.862
- Charmed to make your acquaintance.
- La Rue, that's a French name, right?

11:45.079 --> 11:49.207
Creole. Born and raised in Louisiana.

11:49.416 --> 11:50.792
Is that right?

11:51.001 --> 11:52.994
- Tommy Smalls.
- Sugar Ray.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.963
How's the laugh?
I don't believe we've met.

11:56.173 --> 12:00.171
- Dominique La Rue.
- Tommy, would you like a table?

12:00.386 --> 12:02.674
Please. Thank you very much.

12:02.888 --> 12:07.883
Curtis! Get Mr Smalls and his party
one of our best tables.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.474
You got it, sir. Right this way.

12:18.737 --> 12:22.865
- Didn't I ask you not to mess with her?
- I just said hi.

12:23.075 --> 12:27.120
I know, but you got a way of saying hi.
Just check them out.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.369
All right. l'm cool.

12:30.457 --> 12:35.368
Ray, I think you'd better
go over to Bennie's crap table.

12:35.587 --> 12:38.257
- People are complaining about him.
- Why?

12:38.465 --> 12:41.217
- His glasses.
- I got them yesterday.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.887
I know, but he won't wear them.
He says he don't need to.

12:46.098 --> 12:50.261
No more bets.
The dice are coming out. Let them roll.

12:54.356 --> 12:58.685
- The point is four.
- It was seven, man!

12:58.902 --> 13:03.564
l'm sorry, forgive me. That's a seven.
Pay everybody. All right.

13:05.242 --> 13:10.449
Dice coming out. Get your bets down.
All right, shake them up.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.493
- Five is the point.
- Five? That is a nine, man!

13:18.172 --> 13:20.460
l've got something in my eye.

13:20.674 --> 13:25.502
- Get it out, you blind motherfucker!
- No more 'motherfuckers', you hear?

13:26.805 --> 13:30.673
We're going to shoot the dice now.
Get your bets down.

13:35.189 --> 13:39.138
- Eleven.
- What's the matter with you?

13:39.359 --> 13:41.933
That's six, man!

13:42.154 --> 13:45.025
- Don't scream.
- What are you doing?

13:45.240 --> 13:47.447
- How's it going, Bennie?
- Real good.

13:47.659 --> 13:51.408
Wally, take over for Bennie.
I want to speak to him.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.291
Gentlemen, enjoy the game.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.750
- How's it going?
- Real good.

14:00.964 --> 14:03.586
l'm getting complaints.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.501
That's them suckers losing their money.
l'm Bennie 'Snake Eyes' Wilson.

14:07.721 --> 14:11.173
I can call the dice before they roll.
Done it for 40 years.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.476
I know, Snake Eyes,
but put on your glasses.

14:14.687 --> 14:19.016
- I don't need no glasses.
- I know. Just do me a favour.

14:22.695 --> 14:28.116
- Yes, there you go. You look good.
- I don't feel no different.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.816
Well, let's try it.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.918
- Enjoy the game, gentlemen.
- Fuck you all, man.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.796
It doesn't make sense, Bugs.

14:51.890 --> 14:55.140
What's that, Tony?
What doesn't make sense?

14:55.352 --> 14:59.267
Business isn't great, but the crowd
is the same the last two weeks,

14:59.481 --> 15:02.103
yet we're not clearing
what we used to.

15:02.317 --> 15:05.402
It makes sense.
Smalls is skimming off the top.

15:05.612 --> 15:09.480
- He doesn't have the balls.
- Don't underestimate Tommy.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.318
He's got huge balls,
big fucking huge balls.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.028
But he's stupid.

15:16.248 --> 15:21.159
All told, he beat me
for five grand last month. Check.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.747
Smalls wouldn't do that.
I hand-picked him myself.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.168
You made a mistake with him.
A big mistake.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.473
You hand-picked him?

15:35.684 --> 15:38.970
I guess that makes you
kind of responsible.

15:39.980 --> 15:45.437
- Tell me about Sugar Ray's.
- I figure he's pulling in 10, 15 a week.

15:45.652 --> 15:50.943
- Does he run it alone?
- His son's with him. His name's Quick.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.987
Checkmate.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.077
Is that right?

16:02.753 --> 16:07.960
I think we should have Mr Cantone
pay Mr Sugar Ray a visit.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.758
Kind of feel him out.

16:12.971 --> 16:18.132
We have to get rid of his establishment.
It's hurting my business.

16:18.352 --> 16:22.396
- lt's done. l'll call Cantone right now.
- Wait a minute.

16:22.606 --> 16:27.648
About Tommy Smalls. You brought him
to me, so the money I lost is your fault.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.380
Come here.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.764
Put your hand on the edge.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.780
Nobody steals from me.

17:18.996 --> 17:24.785
The next time you bring somebody
crooked in, l'm going to fucking kill you.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.374
- Understand?
- Yes.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.853
Let Joey take a look at it.

17:45.147 --> 17:49.773
- Joey, is it broke?
- Yes, it's broke pretty good.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.775
- How's your right hand? OK?
- lt's OK.

17:55.991 --> 18:00.534
Good. I want you to take care
of Smalls as soon as possible.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.118
Take care of your bad hand first,

18:03.332 --> 18:07.579
then take your good hand
and cut Tommy's throat

18:07.795 --> 18:09.834
from here...

18:10.047 --> 18:12.170
...to here.

18:12.382 --> 18:16.760
700 at the bar,
1,300 at the crap tables.

18:17.846 --> 18:21.262
- What did we do on the door?
- About 300.

18:21.475 --> 18:26.516
- Vera hasn't brought the girl's money.
- Go tell Vera to bring her ass in here.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.221
What is wrong with her, Sugar?

18:29.441 --> 18:33.106
- What's with Tommy Smalls?
- I don't know. I put Romeo on him.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.274
Nothing much, he had a few drinks,

18:36.490 --> 18:39.776
dropped 200 at the crap table,
made a phone call and left.

18:39.994 --> 18:44.074
- Don't worry.
- l'm not worried, just a little concerned.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.370
Calhoune's number-one boy
drops by to snoop a little bit.

18:48.585 --> 18:54.458
That makes me uncomfortable.
You guys keep your eyes out, OK?

19:04.560 --> 19:08.509
Vera, you know we tally up at 4 o'clock.
What is your problem?

19:08.731 --> 19:13.393
Kiss my ass. I have to watch
my girls until the last trick is gone.

19:13.610 --> 19:18.652
I won't ask a customer to roll over
so I can punch a goddamn clock.

19:18.866 --> 19:24.370
This is your place, but I am in charge
of the girls. Just kiss my ass.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.577
Sugar, stop doing that. Don't do that.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.209
- How did we do tonight?
- We made 200.

19:35.424 --> 19:40.418
200? You girls have been back there
all night. How come only 200?

19:40.637 --> 19:45.465
Kiss my ass. I say nothing when
the crap tables and the bar are short.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.768
That's because
just the girls come up short.

19:51.065 --> 19:56.521
- Calm down, Vera.
- Kiss my ass. What's Quick saying?

19:56.737 --> 20:00.651
- You're in charge of the girls, right?
- I am in charge of the girls.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.535
- Are you in charge of the girls?
- I am.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.828
The girls are always coming up short.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.823
Even when the place is packed
the girls come up short.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.459
Either you or them
have a problem with arithmetic.

20:14.671 --> 20:17.589
Are you saying l'm stealing?

20:17.800 --> 20:21.169
The man didn't say that.
Sit down and shut up.

20:21.387 --> 20:27.555
You shut up, Bennie. l'd tell you to kiss
my ass, but you're too blind to find it.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.227
Fuck you, bitch.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.058
- Me and you got to step out back.
- It was a misunderstanding.

20:37.277 --> 20:41.856
No, it ain't no misunderstanding.
Quick just accused me of stealing.

20:42.074 --> 20:46.902
If you want to defend Quick,
then we can all be fighting tonight.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.908
Bring your ass, nigger. Come on.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.828
Bring your ass. Get up and come on.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.376
All right, bitch, you want to fight?
We'll fight, then.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.713
You fat motherfucker,
l'm tired of your shit!

21:04.930 --> 21:08.381
l'm going to beat the shit
out of your ass.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.935
Don't hold me, Sugar.
No, Sugar, let me go!

21:13.147 --> 21:17.061
- Just scaring her a little. Don't hold me!
- You fucking with a heavyweight.

21:21.614 --> 21:26.026
Treating me like l'm some kind of dog.
l'll kick his ass.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.154
Come on. Come on!

21:44.344 --> 21:47.014
Come on. Don't you want to talk?

21:47.222 --> 21:50.591
You've insulted me
and l've got to kick your ass.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.012
And afterwards
I don't want no hard feelings.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.057
What is wrong with you?

21:58.275 --> 22:01.775
What is wrong with you?
You accused me of stealing.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.608
Only thing l'm stealing is your face.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.569
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Oh, yeah...

22:13.373 --> 22:16.078
That's what l'm talking about.

22:16.293 --> 22:19.543
Come on, sucker. Let's get it on.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.669
You want to fight?

22:23.884 --> 22:28.511
Come on. l'm going to beat the shit
out of your ass, motherfucker.

22:32.935 --> 22:37.762
- You punch people in the eyes? Bitch.
- Is that all you got?

22:37.982 --> 22:41.066
You think that's all?
l'm going to blast your teeth out.

22:41.276 --> 22:45.820
- Nigger, you hit like a bitch.
- You're slower than you thought.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.899
I punch like a bitch, OK?
I punch like a bitch?

22:50.119 --> 22:52.526
Say goodnight to this bitch now.

22:59.670 --> 23:04.913
You're going to have to learn
to respect me.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.757
And the next time...

23:12.808 --> 23:17.020
...you accuse me of stealing,
l'll kick your ass again.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.819
You crazy bitch.

23:36.832 --> 23:42.372
Oh, you want to hit people
with garbage cans?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.413
Now l've got to cut you.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.924
Vera, put that razor away.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.881
Put it away, or l'll blow
your pinkie toe off.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.434
Now you're going to shoot me
in my pinkie toe.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.685
l'm not playing with you.

24:00.898 --> 24:06.023
l'll blow that little black, crusty toe
off your foot. Put the razor away!

24:06.236 --> 24:09.237
You must be crazy
to pull your gun on me.

24:09.448 --> 24:14.787
You'll be the biggest limping bitch
in Harlem if you don't stop. Put it away.

24:14.995 --> 24:18.945
Go ahead, shoot.
Here it is. Shoot, Quick.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.242
Take your best shot.

24:33.597 --> 24:37.547
- You didn't have to shoot her.
- She was trying to kill me.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.341
She was trying to scare you.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.349
That bitch was going
to cut me with a razor.

24:43.565 --> 24:48.192
I usually kill over something like that.
I don't want to talk about it.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.942
Vera whipped your ass.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.323
If you hadn't had that gun,
she'd still be doing it.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.326
You laugh at the wrong shit.

24:56.537 --> 25:01.697
He shot my pinkie toe. l'm gonna put
my foot in your ass. l'll kill him.

25:01.917 --> 25:06.045
Be careful taking her out of here.
Don't kill anyone, just relax.

25:07.256 --> 25:10.375
Vera, we're going to find your toe.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.878
You've got to stop overreacting.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.219
- Overreacting?
- Yes.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.926
- Get your old ass in the car.
- Fuck you.

25:22.146 --> 25:25.645
Next time you fight,
pick on somebody your own size.

25:46.920 --> 25:51.132
- Goodnight, guys. Take it easy.
- Goodnight, Sugar.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.722
Hello, Raymond. How are you doing?

26:13.614 --> 26:16.283
My name is Sergeant Phil Cantone.

26:17.493 --> 26:22.783
- What are you doing in my place?
- I needed to speak with you, Ray.

26:22.998 --> 26:26.747
You wouldn't want me standing around
in this neighbourhood.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.286
A fellow could get hurt.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.256
And please, put the gun down, Ray.

26:33.467 --> 26:37.547
Coloured guys with guns
make me nervous.

26:43.018 --> 26:48.688
So, you have a nice house here, Ray.
Real nice.

26:55.322 --> 26:59.699
So, Sergeant Cantone,
how can I help you?

27:02.913 --> 27:07.622
Jesus, that's a beautiful suit.
What is that, Macy's?

27:07.835 --> 27:12.497
This is tailor-made. If you want
my tailor's number, I can give...

27:12.715 --> 27:16.333
No. No, I buy off the rack.

27:16.552 --> 27:21.048
No, get out of here.
Your clothes, they fit you so well.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.675
That's funny.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.510
I mean, that's really funny.

27:29.690 --> 27:34.648
My clothes fit me well?
Did you used to be a nightclub comic?

27:34.862 --> 27:39.274
No, I owned a candy store.
For 20 years.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.243
- The candy business?
- 20 years.

27:42.453 --> 27:46.237
- Are you serious?
- 20 years.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.871
Well, that's strange.

27:50.085 --> 27:56.337
Because somebody told me you run
an after-hours club, 'Club Sugar Ray's'.

27:56.550 --> 28:01.793
Hottest spot in Harlem. They told me
you can gamble, drink, fuck, dance.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.339
Fuck and dance at my place?

28:04.558 --> 28:07.974
You can do anyhing there.
Aren't you that Sugar Ray?

28:08.187 --> 28:10.559
No, that's not me.

28:10.773 --> 28:16.893
l'm sorry. l'm in the wrong place.
I thought you were that Sugar Ray.

28:17.112 --> 28:20.861
The candy business? That's great.

28:21.074 --> 28:26.235
You live in a great place and wear
tailor-made suits from selling candy.

28:26.455 --> 28:29.539
The candy business is something else.

28:29.750 --> 28:33.830
l'll say. There can't be a nigger
with a healthy tooth in his mouth.

28:40.469 --> 28:44.170
Oh, well... l'll see you later, Ray.

28:47.059 --> 28:51.306
You know, maybe I should
go into the candy business, too.

28:51.522 --> 28:54.938
l'd like to wear nice clothes
and live in a place like this.

28:55.150 --> 28:59.942
I know a lot about candy.
Are you looking for a partner, Ray?

29:00.823 --> 29:02.899
No, I don't think so.

29:04.368 --> 29:07.618
'Sugar Phil's Candy Store'.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.282
I like that!

29:14.670 --> 29:19.795
Maybe l'm just dreaming, Ray.
l'm a cop, for Christ's sake.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.053
See you later.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.346
I bet you will.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.191
Shit.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.743
Why would Calhoune
care about your place

29:52.958 --> 29:56.208
when he owns almost
every after-hours spot in the city?

29:56.420 --> 29:59.421
I don't know, maybe he wants more.

29:59.631 --> 30:03.047
We're going to have to relocate,
I know that.

30:03.260 --> 30:07.127
Why do we have to relocate?
I don't want to leave New York.

30:07.348 --> 30:11.677
I don't either, but Calhoune
ain't the type you fuck with.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.515
Hey, it's the champ!

30:18.400 --> 30:21.318
Next week you knock that boy out!

30:21.528 --> 30:23.984
Hey, Sugar Ray!

30:27.242 --> 30:30.907
- How you doing, Champ?
- What's going on?

30:31.121 --> 30:35.499
Hello, gentlemen...ladies.

30:35.709 --> 30:39.707
- How is everybody doing?
- Fine. You ready for next week?

30:43.634 --> 30:46.303
Ready? Yeah.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.257
l'm ready.

30:50.516 --> 30:54.015
l'm betting a lot of money on you.

30:54.228 --> 30:56.267
Well...

31:02.403 --> 31:05.985
...you get ready to be a rich nigger.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.950
You see, 'cause...

31:11.120 --> 31:13.527
...come next week...

31:18.377 --> 31:22.161
...l'm knocking somebody
the fuck out.

31:23.090 --> 31:27.633
- You understand what l'm saying?
- I understand now.

31:27.845 --> 31:30.086
It took a while, but I got it.

31:31.432 --> 31:37.386
Well, you people enjoy your meal.
Come on, babies.

31:37.604 --> 31:39.727
Take care, Champ.

31:41.358 --> 31:45.687
That nigger's going to kill that white boy.
I saw him fight 33 rounds.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.692
A lot of people think
that white boy got a shot.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.149
He's got a shot. In his ass.

31:53.996 --> 31:56.202
We'll make a killing with those odds.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.499
All the white people
will bet on that white boy.

31:59.710 --> 32:04.917
Gambling is where it's at. If we move,
we should concentrate on that.

32:05.132 --> 32:09.130
Give up the joy houses and after-hours
spots. Concentrate on gambling.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.345
About this move,
we're jumping the gun.

32:12.556 --> 32:16.885
Smalls comes here and a cop
visits the apartment. So we pack up?

32:17.102 --> 32:21.349
- We don't know if he's with Calhoune.
- It could all be coincidence.

32:21.565 --> 32:25.266
Leaving New York
is the last thing we should do.

32:25.486 --> 32:27.941
I ain't afraid of Smalls or Calhoune.

32:28.155 --> 32:34.158
That's because you're young and full
of vigour and life...and a little ignorant.

32:34.369 --> 32:38.830
Calhoune can kill you
by snapping his fucking fingers.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.911
Oh, man, fuck Calhoune.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.618
You know, you have to slow down.

32:44.838 --> 32:48.883
We're in the very small leagues here.
Very small.

32:49.093 --> 32:53.042
It's a big world outside Sugar Hill.
You know nothing about it.

32:53.263 --> 32:58.638
I do know this, when the majors want
to play where you're playing, you move.

32:58.852 --> 33:03.847
That's bullshit. Why should we build
the market up for somebody else?

33:04.066 --> 33:08.728
It's all illegal anyway. l'm not afraid
of Calhoune. I have a gun, too.

33:08.946 --> 33:12.730
You got a gun, he's got one.
His boys and his cops got guns.

33:12.950 --> 33:17.446
He has judges on his payroll.
Don't you feel a little uncomfortable?

33:17.663 --> 33:22.740
You are a bad motherfucker. But that's
a hundred guns against your gun.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.914
That's got to change something
in your mind.

33:27.589 --> 33:30.923
It's not how many people you shoot,

33:31.135 --> 33:33.341
it's who you shoot.

33:38.058 --> 33:40.300
I got to go to the bathroom.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.777
Are you still worrying about the club?

33:52.698 --> 33:56.316
No, l'm thinking about Quick.

33:57.578 --> 34:00.247
He's so damn hot-headed.

34:00.456 --> 34:03.160
Everything I say to him means nothing.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.620
Baby.

34:07.880 --> 34:11.746
He's young. He's going to calm down.

34:11.967 --> 34:16.094
He's...confused or something.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.677
He's so damn ambitious.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.725
Baby, you know...

34:26.982 --> 34:31.893
- There's nothing wrong with ambition.
- It is in the wrong circles.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.652
Sugar Ray.

34:41.871 --> 34:45.455
Are we going to talk
about your son all night?

34:45.667 --> 34:48.158
Or are you going to make love to me?

34:48.379 --> 34:52.328
Why don't we make love...

34:53.425 --> 34:57.340
...and talk about my son
in the morning?

34:58.222 --> 35:00.179
Well...

35:05.020 --> 35:09.516
What if we made love all night...

35:12.569 --> 35:15.736
...and then made love all morning?

35:18.200 --> 35:21.035
And all afternoon?

35:22.037 --> 35:26.366
What if we made love real hard
for 35 minutes

35:26.583 --> 35:30.830
and drop off
into a deep coma-like sleep?

35:35.509 --> 35:37.632
Meet me halfway.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.795
l'll give it a shot.

35:47.562 --> 35:52.640
I knew it. I knew it!
That girl the other night mailed me this.

35:52.860 --> 35:58.364
'Dear Mr Quick, I couldn't help but
acknowledge our mutual attraction.'

35:58.574 --> 36:02.702
'Perhaps we should have dinner
and talk. Please respond, EV2-0304.'

36:02.911 --> 36:05.118
'Truly, Miss Dominique La Rue.'

36:05.330 --> 36:08.865
See, that girl had nothing to do
with that cop.

36:09.084 --> 36:14.079
She made Smalls bring her here
so she could meet me.

36:14.298 --> 36:17.667
- I said not to mess with her.
- She came after me.

36:17.885 --> 36:22.381
We don't know if she's still
with Calhoune. I can find out.

36:22.598 --> 36:26.465
- Where did she get that French name?
- She's Creole.

36:27.478 --> 36:32.436
Don't mess with Creole women.
They can put a root on your ass.

36:33.484 --> 36:37.612
- What's a root?
- lt's a voodoo curse Creole girls do.

36:39.072 --> 36:42.157
- Get out of here.
- No, he's not lying. He's serious.

36:42.367 --> 36:46.412
- What's his name who had that curse?
- Wallace Wallcott.

36:46.622 --> 36:51.913
He was messing around with a Creole
girl, and she put voodoo on him.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.876
His dick shrunk
to the size of a cocktail weenie.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.217
No, that's bullshit.

37:03.931 --> 37:07.264
You got to get out of the jungle
with that witchcraft jazz.

37:07.476 --> 37:08.970
I don't like it.

37:09.186 --> 37:14.393
I just want to know if she's still with
Calhoune. Witchcraft is your thing.

37:14.608 --> 37:18.440
They bury your drawers in the yard
so you can't go out.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.148
Yeah!

37:21.198 --> 37:23.025
Your drawers in the yard?

37:44.555 --> 37:47.425
Hey, Sugar.
What was the number today?

37:47.641 --> 37:49.515
3-0-4.

37:49.727 --> 37:53.309
That's the third time
they slapped my number.

37:53.522 --> 37:58.231
Somebody better take care of it.
You'll take care of my money.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.981
- What's wrong with him?
- He lost a number.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.191
So is she still with him?

38:05.409 --> 38:10.284
I don't know. She wouldn't talk on
the phone. We're doing good tonight.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.786
We're doing great. Look.

38:15.377 --> 38:19.505
Damn...!
Until a couple of seconds ago.

38:29.933 --> 38:34.311
- Who's that?
- The cop who came by my house.

38:40.986 --> 38:44.272
Hey, Ray. The candy man.

38:44.490 --> 38:50.824
Hello, Sergeant Cantone.
l'd like you to meet a friend, Mr Quick.

38:51.038 --> 38:56.329
- Quick like in 'fast'?
- Quick like in 'quick to whip ass'.

38:56.543 --> 39:00.411
You mean like 'you might
get your ass whipped quick'?

39:00.631 --> 39:05.376
I haven't had my ass whipped in a while.
Probably been like 1911 .

39:05.594 --> 39:11.348
- When the doctor slapped your ass.
- That's the last time. l'm looking for him.

39:11.558 --> 39:15.770
Well, stick around.
l'm kind of mad at you, Ray.

39:15.979 --> 39:20.024
- Why are you mad at me?
- You lied to me.

39:20.234 --> 39:25.690
You said you were in the candy
business. It was you I was looking for.

39:25.906 --> 39:28.860
Are you going to take me in for that?

39:32.204 --> 39:35.371
No, I ain't going to arrest you.

39:35.583 --> 39:39.829
I want to talk business with you.
Where can we talk?

39:40.045 --> 39:43.580
- My office.
- Where's your office?

39:46.677 --> 39:52.098
Here's the deal. I got a call from a friend
by the name of Bugsy Calhoune.

39:52.307 --> 39:55.012
He said you were sitting
on a goldmine here.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.932
Now, don't get me wrong...

39:58.146 --> 40:01.017
...there's always
going to be after-hour places.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.724
We generally leave them alone,

40:03.944 --> 40:07.645
but you guys are doing
10,000-15,000 a week.

40:07.865 --> 40:10.190
That's a lot of money.

40:10.409 --> 40:15.285
To be perfectly honest, Mr Calhoune
and myself want some of it.

40:15.497 --> 40:19.625
How much money are you talking about,
you maggot motherfucker?

40:22.504 --> 40:27.546
You guys are doing 15,000.
Let's say our cut is 10,000.

40:30.679 --> 40:33.348
You're robbing us, you son of a bitch.

40:33.557 --> 40:36.475
No, no. You're robbing the system, Ray.

40:36.685 --> 40:41.893
What do you want, sympathy from me?
You're criminals, for Christ's sake!

40:42.107 --> 40:44.645
It's a pretty fair deal.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.730
I wanted more.

40:47.946 --> 40:52.407
But Bugsy said it was fair.
He's a real softy, Bugsy.

40:52.618 --> 40:57.493
If it was up to me, l'd give you jigs
just enough money to function.

40:57.706 --> 41:02.701
When I see you guys with the fancy
suits and cars and nice houses,

41:02.920 --> 41:05.956
and l'm living in a fucking hovel!

41:13.305 --> 41:16.010
I mean, that bothers me.

41:19.937 --> 41:22.606
So have we got a deal or what?

41:28.988 --> 41:31.027
Can we get back to you?

41:40.833 --> 41:44.332
No, l'll get back to you.

41:50.926 --> 41:56.300
Ray, would you mind
if I take a box of chocolate hearts?

41:56.515 --> 42:02.055
- lt's my wife's birthday.
- Help yourself. Anyhing you want.

42:03.397 --> 42:04.856
Thanks.

42:08.068 --> 42:12.018
Round everyone up.
Be at my house in an hour.

42:12.239 --> 42:16.818
We can't let him come here
and do this. Don't run from him.

42:17.035 --> 42:22.410
We've got to, but before we do
we're going to kick him in the nuts.

42:26.420 --> 42:31.627
Calhoune can kiss my ass. I won't
give him shit. We ought to relocate.

42:31.842 --> 42:35.460
A lot of you got families
and can't easily relocate.

42:35.679 --> 42:41.682
From your complaints, I know you can't
live on a third of what you earn now.

42:41.894 --> 42:46.105
I have a plan
where we can all make heavy money.

42:46.315 --> 42:51.190
If everything works out the way I plan,
you'll have $50,000 each.

42:53.489 --> 42:55.861
With that, you can relocate.

42:56.075 --> 42:59.574
Go legit if you want to,
open your own business.

42:59.787 --> 43:02.538
How are we going
to make $50,000 each?

43:02.748 --> 43:06.413
Everybody knows
the big fight is this week.

43:06.627 --> 43:11.787
There will be 3/4 of a million dollars
in the booking houses by Friday.

43:12.007 --> 43:14.842
Calhoune's going to make
a lot of money.

43:15.052 --> 43:17.887
He owns all the booking houses
except ours.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.766
How do we make $50,000?

43:25.229 --> 43:27.268
We'll rob Bugsy Calhoune.

43:29.400 --> 43:33.065
We can't stand up to him,
so how can we rob him?

43:33.279 --> 43:36.114
If everything goes the way I plan,

43:36.323 --> 43:39.407
we'll be gone
before he realises he's been hit.

43:39.618 --> 43:44.576
We've got to get cash
and put it on that white boy to win.

43:44.790 --> 43:48.040
- Jenkins will kill that boy.
- Exactly.

43:48.252 --> 43:52.629
Calhoune knows we know Jenkins so
if he sees us betting on the white boy,

43:52.840 --> 43:57.300
he'll think we talked Jenkins into taking
a dive to make money to relocate.

43:57.511 --> 44:00.512
He puts his money
with the other money,

44:00.723 --> 44:04.672
so it doesn't matter who wins,
we're hitting all the money.

44:04.894 --> 44:07.016
You're a smart motherfucker.

44:07.229 --> 44:09.305
- Are you guys with me?
- Yeah!

44:10.315 --> 44:12.723
We'll see you all tomorrow, then.

44:18.824 --> 44:21.694
Quick, I want to talk to you.

44:21.910 --> 44:26.406
You might want to talk
to Tommy Smalls tomorrow.

44:26.623 --> 44:30.538
- For what?
- He can't be that big a 'Tom'.

44:30.752 --> 44:34.252
You loosen him up, maybe he'll tell you
something about Cantone.

44:35.382 --> 44:39.462
- You think Smalls is that stupid?
- I know he's that stupid.

44:47.853 --> 44:51.685
Sergeant Phil Cantone.
Are you with this gentleman?

44:51.899 --> 44:55.517
- No, l'm not.
- lt's nice to meet you.

44:56.195 --> 44:58.068
Come on, Tommy.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.608
Come on!

45:02.451 --> 45:06.235
- What is going on here?
- Are you awake now?

45:06.455 --> 45:09.871
Hell, yeah, l'm awake.
What is going on here?

45:10.083 --> 45:12.372
- All right?
- l'm all right and l'm awake.

45:12.586 --> 45:16.750
What's going on? Why did you
punch me? I should jack you up.

45:16.965 --> 45:21.295
- lt's time to pay the piper, Tommy.
- What are you talking about?

45:21.512 --> 45:25.510
- That five grand you lifted.
- Five who that lifted what?

45:26.934 --> 45:30.053
Wait.
I don't know what you're talking about.

45:30.270 --> 45:34.054
If there's a problem,
we can talk to Calhoune.

45:34.274 --> 45:40.229
I spoke to Mr Calhoune. He wanted me
to say he's mad at you for stealing.

45:40.447 --> 45:43.199
But I ain't stole shit!

45:43.409 --> 45:47.109
And there is one other thing.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.923
Bugsy said I was to cut his throat.

46:05.931 --> 46:07.509
Then cut it.

46:20.195 --> 46:23.398
It's done. Our friend's a memory.

46:31.123 --> 46:34.872
But you know,
the strangest thing just happened.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.296
What's that?

46:38.505 --> 46:44.129
One of Sugar Ray's people
just put a $200,000 bet on the fight.

46:44.344 --> 46:49.137
That's nothing. They're just trying to
make some cash before closing down.

46:49.350 --> 46:54.474
Don't worry. Everybody knows that jig
is going to kill Kirkpatrick.

46:54.688 --> 46:56.348
Yes, I know.

46:57.316 --> 47:00.436
But they're not betting on Jenkins.

47:00.652 --> 47:03.404
They're putting their money
on Kirkpatrick.

47:03.614 --> 47:08.739
At 3-1 they are going to make
six hundred grand if he wins.

47:08.952 --> 47:12.784
Those sneaky bastards.
They put the fix on.

47:14.458 --> 47:16.949
Jenkins is going to throw the fight.

47:17.169 --> 47:19.208
It makes sense.

47:22.049 --> 47:26.675
Jesus. Ain't that champ a wonderful
fucking human being?

47:34.311 --> 47:36.636
So what do you do now?

47:39.525 --> 47:44.187
Why should they be the only ones to
benefit from Mr Jenkins's generosity?

47:44.404 --> 47:47.774
l'm going to put 500,000
on Kirkpatrick to win.

47:47.991 --> 47:50.233
Pick up a little extra cash.

47:50.452 --> 47:55.529
You should scrape together whatever
you can and do the same thing.

48:00.796 --> 48:04.414
- Is Smalls up there?
- Sometimes the buzzers don't work.

48:07.135 --> 48:12.640
My name is Quick. l'm an old friend.
Do you think I could knock on the door?

48:31.952 --> 48:33.696
Smalls?

48:37.166 --> 48:40.499
Tommy, your door is open. It's Quick.

48:43.547 --> 48:46.963
Hey, your door is open. It's Quick.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.799
Smalls!

48:51.847 --> 48:53.923
Hey, Smalls.

48:56.226 --> 48:58.266
Tommy?

49:01.607 --> 49:03.646
Tommy...?

49:04.485 --> 49:06.561
Hey, man, are you asleep?

49:18.415 --> 49:23.326
Holy shit!
Somebody fucked you up real bad.

49:23.545 --> 49:28.670
I think l'm going to leave because
you probably want to sit by yourself

49:28.884 --> 49:33.427
and think about who you pissed off,
so l'll let you have your space.

49:33.639 --> 49:35.181
Excuse me.

49:47.486 --> 49:51.270
- Isn't that Quick?
- Yes, that's him.

49:51.490 --> 49:54.444
What's he doing coming out
of my brother's house?

49:55.119 --> 49:57.444
Let's find out.

50:29.778 --> 50:32.186
Miss La Rue, your guest has arrived.

50:32.406 --> 50:34.233
Hello, Mr Quick.

50:34.449 --> 50:39.491
Meet Mr Bugsy Calhoune
and his assistant, Joseph Leoni.

50:41.123 --> 50:42.498
Have a seat.

50:45.461 --> 50:50.882
- Are those flowers and candy for me?
- No, I brought them for the lady.

50:51.091 --> 50:55.136
Give them to her.
She loves flowers and candy.

51:01.435 --> 51:03.843
So, how's business, Mr Quick?

51:05.063 --> 51:08.515
- Excuse me?
- Business over at Sugar Ray's.

51:09.610 --> 51:11.686
Business is all right.

51:12.613 --> 51:15.863
All right?
I hear you guys are going great.

51:16.074 --> 51:20.119
Dominique says your place was packed
Monday night. Nobody is busy then.

51:20.329 --> 51:24.077
Your place was packed on a Monday.
You must be doing great.

51:24.291 --> 51:27.327
What do you move, 15-20,000 a week?

51:29.046 --> 51:33.957
I don't know about all that shit.
I don't do the books.

51:34.176 --> 51:38.637
You don't see the books?
That would be pretty stupid.

51:38.847 --> 51:43.177
- Well, I trust my partner, Ray.
- Never trust anybody.

51:43.394 --> 51:46.597
Everybody in this business
is a criminal.

51:48.941 --> 51:52.440
This is too deep for me.
I think l'm going to go home.

51:52.653 --> 51:56.781
Wait a second. What's your rush?
Here, have some wine.

51:58.075 --> 52:00.648
By the way, Mr Quick,

52:00.869 --> 52:05.081
did a Sergeant Phil Cantone
come by the other day?

52:05.291 --> 52:07.117
He came by.

52:07.334 --> 52:10.086
He told you about
my business proposition?

52:10.295 --> 52:14.163
He told us about your offer. I wouldn't
call that a business proposition.

52:14.383 --> 52:19.543
It was business, Quick. I don't make
offers. I make business propositions.

52:21.765 --> 52:24.719
l've got a very good one for you.

52:24.935 --> 52:29.229
I want you to work for me
at the Pitty Pat Club.

52:29.439 --> 52:32.809
I want you to run it with Dominique.

52:34.486 --> 52:37.322
- I don't think so.
- Lots of money for you.

52:37.531 --> 52:42.359
After Sugar Ray starts paying us off,
your cut won't be what it used to be.

52:42.578 --> 52:46.825
I could really use you there.
You could turn it into a hot spot.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.828
You understand your people.

52:50.043 --> 52:52.451
Mr Quick.

52:53.547 --> 52:56.501
It would be an advantage to all of us,

52:56.717 --> 52:59.552
if you'd join
Mr Calhoune's organisation.

53:02.806 --> 53:07.433
You guys are incredible. I can't believe
you called me down here and...

53:07.644 --> 53:10.729
This is very nice,
but no thanks. l'm sorry.

53:10.939 --> 53:15.767
There's no reason for you to get upset.
I just want you to think it over.

53:15.986 --> 53:20.897
- There's nothing to think about.
- Joe, show Mr Quick to his car.

53:21.116 --> 53:26.241
Joe, you don't have to show Mr Quick
no place. I can find my way out.

53:26.455 --> 53:28.993
Thank you, but no thanks.

53:38.384 --> 53:43.211
- What do you think of Mr Quick?
- What do you mean?

53:44.556 --> 53:50.476
Do you like him? Do you think he is
someone you might want to fuck?

53:53.482 --> 53:56.399
- Yes.
- Good.

53:57.694 --> 53:59.354
Good.

54:10.416 --> 54:14.793
Let's kill that bastard now, man.
Let's do it for Tommy!

54:38.736 --> 54:40.775
What is this shit about?

54:47.119 --> 54:52.493
- He killed my brother.
- lt's all right, we'll get him.

54:52.708 --> 54:55.993
He messed with
the wrong nigger's brother.

54:56.920 --> 54:58.664
Quick is mine.

55:14.396 --> 55:18.263
Pull up to his bumper,
we'll blow his head off.

55:39.755 --> 55:42.791
Damn, I think I broke my nose!

55:45.135 --> 55:48.172
Junior, are you OK? Junior?

55:48.388 --> 55:53.346
Junior is deader than a motherfucker.
You shot him in the back of the head!

55:53.560 --> 55:57.558
It was a mistake.
Pull up next to that motherfucker.

55:57.773 --> 56:00.809
Shut up, it was a mistake!

56:01.026 --> 56:05.984
It was an accident, Junior.
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Junior.

56:06.198 --> 56:09.069
Get that motherfucker now!

56:09.284 --> 56:11.692
l'm sorry, Junior.

56:34.310 --> 56:39.018
Shut the fuck up!
You're always crying, motherfucker.

56:39.231 --> 56:41.556
Catch him. Come on. Come on!

56:48.407 --> 56:52.274
You are a dead motherfucker.
l'm going to get you.

56:52.494 --> 56:55.828
l'm going to get you.
l'm going to get you, motherfucker!

57:14.183 --> 57:15.760
Fuck!

57:22.649 --> 57:26.065
Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!

57:26.278 --> 57:28.983
Shit! Sneaky motherfucker.
Let's get him.

57:34.953 --> 57:37.444
l'm going to kill you, Quick!

57:40.042 --> 57:44.585
You made me shoot one of my boys
in the back of the head.

57:46.381 --> 57:49.217
And you did something to my brother.

57:49.426 --> 57:52.178
I don't know what you're talking about.

57:52.387 --> 57:56.930
That's bullshit, man.
You know what l'm talking about.

58:01.438 --> 58:03.763
You broke my nose, man.

58:10.406 --> 58:15.032
l'll say this one more time.
I don't know what you're talking about.

58:15.244 --> 58:19.111
And I suggest
you let me go on my way.

58:19.331 --> 58:20.956
Oh, really?

58:29.883 --> 58:32.635
I suggest you kiss my ass, Quick.

58:32.762 --> 58:36.178
The only way you are going home
is shot, motherfucker.

58:39.310 --> 58:43.094
What do you think you're doing
with that little shit?

58:46.401 --> 58:51.063
Stop it. Stop it. Don't shoot
that little motherfucker no more!

58:56.744 --> 58:58.287
Fuck this.

59:25.565 --> 59:27.558
Asshole.

59:31.946 --> 59:35.481
- Quick's pulled up in a cab.
- What's he doing in a cab?

59:38.244 --> 59:42.871
- You in a cab? That ain't your style.
- I had a little fender bender.

59:43.083 --> 59:47.330
- Are you all right?
- I need a second to collect myself.

59:47.545 --> 59:50.665
What did you learn about
Calhoune's girlfriend?

59:52.258 --> 59:57.051
I don't know what I just found out.
How are we going with everything else?

59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.892
Sugar... Right.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.772
Thanks, man. l'll get back to you.

01:00:07.607 --> 01:00:13.361
The same gentleman is doing
the pick-up this year, Mr Richie Vento.

01:00:13.572 --> 01:00:17.355
Vera, I want you
to put somebody on him.

01:00:17.575 --> 01:00:20.363
- All right.
- You got a girl who can turn him out?

01:00:20.578 --> 01:00:25.953
I have got a girl
whose pussy is so good,

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:30.379
if you threw it up in the air,
it would turn into sunshine.

01:00:33.258 --> 01:00:36.709
- I don't want to meet her.
- I do.

01:00:37.595 --> 01:00:39.469
Put her on him.

01:00:41.933 --> 01:00:43.973
Yeah. Who is it?

01:00:46.312 --> 01:00:48.186
Just a moment.

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:50.437
Dominique La Rue.

01:00:52.277 --> 01:00:54.186
That voodoo bitch.

01:00:55.363 --> 01:00:57.735
Hello?

01:00:57.949 --> 01:01:00.950
I can meet with you.
Just you, right?

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:08.166
Give me a half hour. Yeah.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.974
Do come in, Mr Quick.

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:34.733
Very nice. Very impressive.
Very impressive.

01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:40.442
- Is your real name Quick?
- Excuse me?

01:01:40.658 --> 01:01:43.149
Is Quick your real name?

01:01:43.369 --> 01:01:47.414
No, my name is not Quick.
My real name is...

01:01:47.624 --> 01:01:52.369
No one's asked me that. My real name
is...don't laugh...is Vernest.

01:01:52.587 --> 01:01:56.039
I see you are laughing.
My name is Vernest Brown.

01:01:56.257 --> 01:02:00.919
I use Quick because
Vernest Brown is a fucked up name.

01:02:01.137 --> 01:02:04.755
l'd like to change the subject.
Can I have a seat?

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:10.393
This is a very beautiful house.

01:02:10.605 --> 01:02:15.481
It doesn't belong to me. It belongs to
Mr Calhoune. I stay here sometimes.

01:02:15.693 --> 01:02:19.774
- lt's true what they say about you two?
- And what is that?

01:02:19.989 --> 01:02:23.109
You know, they say that...

01:02:23.326 --> 01:02:26.327
They say that you give Calhoune...

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:29.577
...stuff.

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:35.456
- I work for Mr Calhoune.
- What kind of work do you do?

01:02:35.672 --> 01:02:37.830
Whatever's required.

01:02:38.049 --> 01:02:43.838
And your interest in me,
is that business or is it personal?

01:02:44.055 --> 01:02:45.384
Both.

01:02:58.695 --> 01:03:03.191
l'd like to go upstairs. Are you coming?

01:03:24.387 --> 01:03:26.344
That's cute.

01:03:26.556 --> 01:03:32.310
I thought I was the only person
who slept with his guns under the pillow.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:37.728
That is so adorable. We have
so much in common. This is so cute.

01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:44.231
It's cute.

01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:57.623
What are you doing in there?

01:04:20.902 --> 01:04:22.230
Come here.

01:05:35.727 --> 01:05:38.218
You are unbelievable.

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:44.724
So were you, Vernest Brown.

01:05:51.326 --> 01:05:54.611
Only you can make
'Vernest Brown' sound good.

01:05:55.914 --> 01:05:59.330
You are the only person
who can get away with it.

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:05.500
I got a question. You know
what we were just doing, was that...

01:06:05.715 --> 01:06:08.041
Was that work?

01:06:09.469 --> 01:06:13.798
I know work was being done.
I was doing serious work.

01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:19.057
I was working. But was that work
for you, or was that personal?

01:06:20.938 --> 01:06:22.516
Both.

01:06:24.442 --> 01:06:30.231
It was personal for me
and business for Mr Calhoune.

01:06:32.784 --> 01:06:37.695
Is he here? I thought I felt
another hand on my ass a while ago.

01:06:37.914 --> 01:06:43.999
I thought you were going crazy,
but he's under the bed grabbing asses.

01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:48.625
- No, he's not here.
- Well, where is he?

01:06:49.551 --> 01:06:54.296
Don't worry. He isn't coming here.
He's with his wife.

01:06:55.431 --> 01:06:58.931
Bugsy is married?
The man is married to...

01:06:59.144 --> 01:07:02.976
l've been trying to figure this out
since I first saw you.

01:07:03.189 --> 01:07:06.060
Why would a woman like you
be interested

01:07:06.276 --> 01:07:11.650
in a big, fat, greasy, bloated, stinking,
gelatin-ass motherfucker?

01:07:11.864 --> 01:07:16.657
What's the attraction to this man?
Plus he's married, too.

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:21.366
He's a very brilliant man
and he's taught me a lot.

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:24.493
A lot about what?

01:07:28.965 --> 01:07:31.005
Like about the business.

01:07:33.052 --> 01:07:35.128
What about the business?

01:07:38.767 --> 01:07:41.602
That you can't trust anybody.

01:07:41.811 --> 01:07:44.480
Everybody in the business...

01:07:45.607 --> 01:07:47.683
...is a criminal.

01:07:48.693 --> 01:07:51.647
And how can you ever trust a criminal?

01:07:59.746 --> 01:08:05.084
So that's what this is about.
You're supposed to kill me?

01:08:05.293 --> 01:08:06.668
Yes.

01:08:07.962 --> 01:08:13.301
And you would make love to me first,
then shoot me?

01:08:15.887 --> 01:08:18.294
l'm sorry, Vernest.

01:08:19.724 --> 01:08:21.966
It's only business.

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:29.018
This is personal.

01:08:31.027 --> 01:08:36.020
What's the matter with you?
You look at all the other guys but me.

01:08:36.241 --> 01:08:40.535
- I ain't looking at every guy.
- Pay attention to me. l'm your date.

01:08:40.745 --> 01:08:45.323
You ain't got enough of anyhing
for me to mess with.

01:08:45.541 --> 01:08:50.417
You heard me.
l'm going to get myself a real man.

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.880
l've got enough sense
to get away from you.

01:08:55.218 --> 01:08:57.590
Buy your own drinks from now on.

01:08:59.346 --> 01:09:03.974
That girl's been staring at you, Richie.
She wants something.

01:09:04.185 --> 01:09:10.020
- Why did she get rid of that guy?
- She wants us. The three of us, Richie.

01:09:10.233 --> 01:09:13.519
She looks too classy for that.
She's beautiful.

01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:17.948
I don't usually look at coloured women,
but she's gorgeous.

01:09:20.493 --> 01:09:24.028
Richie, she is smiling at you.

01:09:24.788 --> 01:09:28.703
Richie, the lady would like
to buy you a drink.

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:32.287
I told you she was hot.
She wants to fuck.

01:09:32.505 --> 01:09:37.381
- Is she going to buy us a drink, too?
- Sorry, she only said this gentleman.

01:09:38.428 --> 01:09:41.298
Richie, you lucky bastard.

01:09:41.514 --> 01:09:47.683
Listen, tell the lady l'll accept her offer
if she'll come sit with me.

01:09:47.895 --> 01:09:49.224
You got it.

01:10:15.965 --> 01:10:21.505
- You're in, Richie. You're in.
- l'll tell you when l'm in. l'll call you.

01:10:21.721 --> 01:10:24.722
Get out of here, both of you.

01:10:32.649 --> 01:10:35.104
Did you notice me watching you?

01:10:36.444 --> 01:10:40.524
- I can't say I did.
- Well, I was.

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.278
l'm new in town
and I haven't any friends.

01:10:43.493 --> 01:10:47.657
You look quite friendly.
Would you like to be my friend?

01:10:52.126 --> 01:10:54.083
Well, look...

01:10:55.171 --> 01:10:59.999
Sure, l'd like to be my friend.
I mean, be your friend.

01:11:00.218 --> 01:11:03.552
My name is Richie, Richie Vento.

01:11:05.056 --> 01:11:07.974
And what's your name, darling dear?

01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:10.685
Sunshine.

01:11:17.318 --> 01:11:19.892
Yes, goddammit. l'm coming.

01:11:22.449 --> 01:11:24.240
l'm coming.

01:11:28.872 --> 01:11:30.911
Just a minute.

01:11:37.756 --> 01:11:39.583
- How was it?
- I killed her.

01:11:39.799 --> 01:11:43.797
- Tore the pussy up?
- No, man, I killed her.

01:11:44.888 --> 01:11:47.295
What are you talking about?

01:11:51.019 --> 01:11:55.728
- I shot her, man.
- Was the pussy that bad?

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.144
She tried to kill me.
That's why she wanted to see me.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.488
Calhoune tried to use her
to take me out. He tried twice tonight.

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:07.910
- What else happened?
- Smalls' people think I fingered Smalls.

01:12:08.119 --> 01:12:10.693
They tried to kill me after that dinner,

01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:14.365
which was really an invitation
to join Calhoune's gang.

01:12:14.584 --> 01:12:17.336
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

01:12:17.545 --> 01:12:22.884
I was figuring all this out. He ain't getting
a third chance, l'm after him now.

01:12:23.093 --> 01:12:26.793
Be cool. Don't be stupid, now.
Let's figure out what to do.

01:12:27.013 --> 01:12:30.512
I ain't no punk.
You try to kill me, I kill you.

01:12:30.725 --> 01:12:32.883
All right. Sit down.

01:12:33.103 --> 01:12:36.187
- Why should I sit down?
- Sit down, man.

01:12:39.859 --> 01:12:42.646
It's not about being a punk, OK?

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:46.521
Quick, you're not a gangster.

01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:50.573
We're not. We're club owners.
We run a dancehall.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:55.745
Calhoune is a cold-hearted killer.
He'll have your ass killed.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.909
The man probably
doesn't know about La Rue yet.

01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:04.582
But in the morning
he's going to want you dead,

01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:08.799
so we're going to find a place
where we can lay low

01:13:09.013 --> 01:13:12.513
until we can run this scam and split.

01:13:12.725 --> 01:13:16.308
- Are you saying I should hide?
- You're going to hide.

01:13:16.521 --> 01:13:18.810
If you don't, they'll kill you.

01:13:19.023 --> 01:13:24.184
I didn't come this far so you could prove
you ain't no punk and die.

01:13:24.404 --> 01:13:27.607
What about your tombstone?
'Here lies a man, 27 years old.'

01:13:27.824 --> 01:13:30.113
'He died, but he ain't no punk.'

01:13:31.119 --> 01:13:34.819
That's bullshit, OK?
When you die at 89,

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.705
with your children and grandchildren
around the bed, that's cool.

01:13:38.918 --> 01:13:44.921
It ain't cool to die at 27. I won't let you
do that. I won't let you do it to me.

01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:50.258
If they kill you, they'll have to kill me
because l'm going to kill them.

01:14:06.279 --> 01:14:10.193
All right, everybody.
This is a fucking raid.

01:14:10.408 --> 01:14:13.943
Anybody try to leave,
l'll pump one in your ass.

01:14:14.162 --> 01:14:17.116
Everybody's under arrest.

01:14:17.332 --> 01:14:23.417
Cooperate with the officers so we can
get this done as quickly as possible.

01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:28.961
Band! Play some travelling music.

01:14:29.177 --> 01:14:32.546
Everybody's going downtown
on the A train.

01:14:32.764 --> 01:14:34.673
Motherfucker.

01:14:41.564 --> 01:14:43.806
Jack Jenkins!

01:14:46.027 --> 01:14:49.443
Jack Jenkins, the Heavyweight
Champion of the World!

01:14:49.655 --> 01:14:53.107
I can't believe it.
What are you doing here?

01:14:53.326 --> 01:14:56.944
You're the Heavyweight Champion
of the World. My kids love you.

01:14:57.163 --> 01:15:00.947
Everybody I know loves you.
What are you doing here?

01:15:02.085 --> 01:15:05.002
You should be in training.
Will you be ready for the fight?

01:15:12.178 --> 01:15:14.716
l'll be fine.

01:15:15.306 --> 01:15:17.928
You'll be fine.

01:15:19.269 --> 01:15:22.056
Sugar, let's talk in the office.
Can Jack come?

01:15:22.272 --> 01:15:25.890
Come on, Jack. Come on.
The heavyweight champ.

01:15:27.193 --> 01:15:28.985
Can I have your autograph?

01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:35.153
I don't...

01:15:37.329 --> 01:15:40.579
...sign autographs.

01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:43.661
Sure you do, Jack.

01:15:43.876 --> 01:15:46.831
Or you'll go downtown
with the rest of the jigs,

01:15:47.046 --> 01:15:49.372
and you'll miss your fight.

01:15:52.677 --> 01:15:57.588
- Who do I make this out to?
- 'To my good friend Phil.'

01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:01.924
Ray, I won't take you down tonight,

01:16:02.145 --> 01:16:05.929
because I want you to find out
where your friend Quick is.

01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:08.984
But your place is closed down.

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:18.071
Jack, Phil starts with a 'P', not an 'F'.

01:16:22.249 --> 01:16:27.872
What difference does it make?
As long as you keep knocking them out.

01:16:29.422 --> 01:16:33.835
He's a good kid.
If you hear anyhing, let me know, OK?

01:16:39.516 --> 01:16:42.185
Punk m-mo...

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.847
I know.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.522
You need a...

01:17:00.787 --> 01:17:03.907
No, I think l've got one of those tonight.

01:17:07.252 --> 01:17:12.329
Why don't you go home and get some
sleep, Champ? You need your rest.

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:17.463
OK, man.

01:17:24.936 --> 01:17:26.810
Taxi!

01:17:33.695 --> 01:17:35.734
In you go, Champ.

01:17:39.325 --> 01:17:41.781
Take it easy, OK?

01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:57.258
Hi, Mr Calhoune. How are you doing?
How's things going?

01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:03.507
Get in, Ray.

01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:11.772
Where's Quick?

01:18:13.484 --> 01:18:17.613
Quick has nerve problems.
People have been trying to kill him.

01:18:17.822 --> 01:18:20.739
So I let him off for a few days to relax.

01:18:23.203 --> 01:18:27.035
Quick's nerves are bad
from people trying to kill him?

01:18:27.248 --> 01:18:30.035
I know of four people
Quick killed last night.

01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:32.873
One was a pretty young girl I know.

01:18:38.134 --> 01:18:40.804
Would you know anyhing
about that, Ray?

01:18:46.434 --> 01:18:51.559
Quick? Oh, man.
Where did you hear that?

01:18:51.773 --> 01:18:56.934
I hear a lot of things, Ray.
A lot of things.

01:18:57.153 --> 01:19:00.569
I hear you are ruining my business
with your club.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:03.866
I hear you don't want to go
into business with me.

01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:07.777
You know, I hear all these things, Ray.

01:19:07.998 --> 01:19:10.868
And I add them up.
Know what I come up with?

01:19:13.086 --> 01:19:15.125
- No.
- You don't?

01:19:17.215 --> 01:19:22.671
That you're a smart old man who knows
when he's finished and it's time to leave.

01:19:22.887 --> 01:19:25.758
But there's a young hothead
who thinks he's tough

01:19:26.015 --> 01:19:31.258
and wants to start some shit instead of
letting things take their natural course.

01:19:31.479 --> 01:19:34.017
That's what I come up with.

01:19:36.609 --> 01:19:41.318
A young dumb fuck who's going
to make it two less jigs in this world.

01:19:41.531 --> 01:19:44.532
One old and one young.

01:19:44.742 --> 01:19:49.369
When you see Quick, I suggest
you guys make plans to go elsewhere,

01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:52.368
because l'm tired
of playing around with jigs.

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.038
You get me?

01:19:57.630 --> 01:19:59.338
Is that all?

01:19:59.549 --> 01:20:03.298
- What?
- Is that all?

01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:11.637
Yeah, Ray, yeah. I think that's all.

01:20:16.357 --> 01:20:18.101
Goodnight.

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:37.288
l'd like to have the people
on that list bailed out.

01:20:44.302 --> 01:20:48.715
There are 125 people on this list.
You're posting bail for 125 people?

01:20:48.932 --> 01:20:50.474
Is that a problem?

01:20:52.602 --> 01:20:54.476
Just a minute.

01:20:57.649 --> 01:21:01.860
A guy wants to post bail on everybody
arrested at the after-hours joint.

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:04.857
- Who is he?
- Some fancy coloured guy.

01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:10.364
He's probably some nut. Tell him how
much it'll cost and he'll run off scared.

01:21:16.876 --> 01:21:18.833
OK, let's see.

01:21:19.045 --> 01:21:24.964
125 people on a class A
misdemeanour will be about...

01:21:26.845 --> 01:21:29.051
...$7,500.

01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:31.256
$7,500?

01:21:31.474 --> 01:21:35.887
Yes, $7,500.

01:21:39.607 --> 01:21:41.647
Give me a receipt.

01:21:42.568 --> 01:21:44.857
l'm sorry about the inconvenience.

01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:55.538
Kiss my entire ass.

01:22:01.004 --> 01:22:05.915
Quick, you should have seen it.
30 limousines driving off into the sunset.

01:22:06.134 --> 01:22:08.755
Them white boys
didn't know what to think.

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:12.339
We can't reopen
because they'll bust us every night.

01:22:12.557 --> 01:22:16.389
In every limousine
there was a box of candy,

01:22:16.603 --> 01:22:20.352
and every box had a note,
'Sorry for the inconvenience.'

01:22:20.565 --> 01:22:23.234
You are a cool,
sweet motherfucker, Sugar.

01:22:23.443 --> 01:22:25.566
I love to see shit like that.

01:22:25.779 --> 01:22:29.527
You'd love to see anyhing.
What have you got to eat?

01:22:29.741 --> 01:22:34.450
l've got some cans of hash in there.
Fix me some hash and eggs.

01:22:34.663 --> 01:22:37.236
- You want anyhing?
- l'm OK.

01:22:37.457 --> 01:22:40.742
Get your little narrow ass
off the arm of that sofa.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.795
So, everybody's looking for me?

01:22:44.005 --> 01:22:47.955
Yes. We'll be out of here soon.
We do our thing and then we step.

01:22:48.176 --> 01:22:50.465
How's Sunshine doing?

01:22:50.679 --> 01:22:53.169
He proposed to her four times already,

01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:56.841
said he'd leave his wife
and convert from Catholic to Baptist.

01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:00.310
That's some mean pussy
to make a man change gods.

01:23:03.608 --> 01:23:07.688
- Where's the hash?
- Middle cabinet on the third shelf.

01:23:07.904 --> 01:23:12.198
- That's not hash, it's tuna fish.
- Make some tuna, then.

01:23:12.408 --> 01:23:14.816
You've got to do something
about them eyes.

01:23:15.036 --> 01:23:20.113
l'm ready for hash, and you ain't got
no hash. Don't keep fucking with me!

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:24.580
- Bitch, please.
- 'Bitch, please,' my ass!

01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:27.465
- Do you want a sandwich?
- If it's not too much trouble.

01:23:27.674 --> 01:23:32.632
Don't get smart with me.
You're the dumbest ass in captivity.

01:23:32.846 --> 01:23:36.760
Did you apologise to her
for shooting her in the foot?

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.145
Did you ever apologise to her?

01:23:45.191 --> 01:23:47.860
I thought that thing was forgotten.

01:23:48.069 --> 01:23:51.687
She said that,
but I think she still was a little hurt.

01:23:51.906 --> 01:23:57.281
She still is. She doesn't show it,
but inside she is a sweet old woman.

01:23:57.496 --> 01:24:02.371
Bennie, why did you put this juice back
with just a swallow left?

01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:04.208
Leave me alone.

01:24:04.418 --> 01:24:07.503
It doesn't make sense.
You should just finish it.

01:24:07.714 --> 01:24:11.129
Don't put it back
with just a swallow in the container.

01:24:11.342 --> 01:24:14.842
I get set for orange juice,
and there's just a swallow left.

01:24:15.055 --> 01:24:18.055
- Swallow it and shut up.
- Blind motherfucker!

01:24:18.266 --> 01:24:22.762
You fat bitch! You should go talk to her
and tell her you're sorry.

01:24:24.647 --> 01:24:26.391
Yes, you should.

01:24:33.114 --> 01:24:35.237
You want a sandwich, Quick?

01:24:37.911 --> 01:24:39.321
No.

01:24:41.372 --> 01:24:42.950
l'm OK.

01:24:44.625 --> 01:24:47.829
- You OK?
- Yes, I just can't stand a lot of silly shit.

01:24:48.046 --> 01:24:50.715
Now, why wouldn't he finish this?

01:24:50.923 --> 01:24:53.166
That's just dumb.

01:24:54.177 --> 01:24:56.418
Hey, you know, Vera...

01:25:00.016 --> 01:25:04.643
...I never said 'l'm sorry'
to nobody for nothing I did.

01:25:04.854 --> 01:25:06.479
But...

01:25:08.399 --> 01:25:12.267
...I wish what happened
never happened, and...

01:25:12.487 --> 01:25:15.654
...I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

01:25:19.577 --> 01:25:21.486
And...

01:25:24.541 --> 01:25:25.869
...l'm sorry.

01:25:26.084 --> 01:25:28.041
Take your sorry ass in there

01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:33.211
and tell Sugar to send somebody
to get some orange juice.

01:25:33.425 --> 01:25:35.583
I love you, too.

01:25:41.182 --> 01:25:43.638
Little old boy.

01:25:43.852 --> 01:25:46.556
I love that little old boy.

01:25:51.776 --> 01:25:55.062
l'm falling in love with you.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.319
Oh, Richie.

01:25:57.532 --> 01:26:01.150
l'm serious. Nobody's ever
made me feel the way you do.

01:26:03.955 --> 01:26:06.493
When can I see you again?

01:26:11.296 --> 01:26:13.751
l'll be free after the fight tomorrow.

01:26:13.965 --> 01:26:19.386
No, tomorrow night's bad.
I got something to do.

01:26:19.596 --> 01:26:22.513
All night?

01:26:22.724 --> 01:26:25.131
Between 8 and 10.

01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:30.141
Why don't you do what you have to do...

01:26:31.524 --> 01:26:37.230
...and then after you finish,
you come back and you pick me up?

01:26:37.447 --> 01:26:41.314
Wait, I forgot.
l'm finished with my work at 9.30.

01:26:41.534 --> 01:26:46.777
That means I have to stand outside
in the cold with all that stuff in my bag.

01:26:46.999 --> 01:26:50.248
What stuff? What do you do, anyway?

01:26:53.963 --> 01:26:57.249
Every month I do a numbers pick-up
at one place,

01:26:57.467 --> 01:27:02.544
and I drop it off at another
the next day, and I get paid for it.

01:27:03.723 --> 01:27:05.716
You're a pick-up girl?

01:27:06.643 --> 01:27:11.222
- I knew you'd hate me. l'll just leave.
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:27:11.439 --> 01:27:15.936
Someday l'll tell you what I do,
and we'll both laugh about this.

01:27:21.157 --> 01:27:23.695
l'm so glad you're not angry.

01:27:24.995 --> 01:27:30.071
I shouldn't stand on that corner for half
an hour with all that stuff in my bag.

01:27:30.291 --> 01:27:32.580
Let's get together another time.

01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:38.713
Listen, where are you going
to be tomorrow night at 9.30?

01:27:38.925 --> 01:27:42.009
My pick-up is on Lenox Avenue.

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:47.594
Tomorrow night at 9.30 l'll pick you up
at Lenox and 110th Street.

01:27:47.809 --> 01:27:53.017
- What about what you had to do?
- l'll pick you up along the way.

01:27:55.775 --> 01:28:01.694
You make me so happy. You know what
I do when you still want to see me?

01:28:01.906 --> 01:28:06.235
Richie, you know, I have to admit,

01:28:06.453 --> 01:28:10.913
when we first met,
I was intimidated by you.

01:28:11.124 --> 01:28:15.288
- You were?
- And when we made love, I held back.

01:28:15.503 --> 01:28:17.163
You did?

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:21.792
But now that l've told you
the truth about myself,

01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:28.297
I want to be completely free to do
any and every thing you want me to.

01:28:28.516 --> 01:28:30.141
Oh, God!

01:28:31.269 --> 01:28:34.519
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:37.648
- Lenox and 110th?
- Yes.

01:28:41.029 --> 01:28:44.445
l'll be there. You bet.

01:28:50.121 --> 01:28:52.957
Richie...

01:28:54.125 --> 01:28:56.581
...I think l'm falling in love with you.

01:29:27.158 --> 01:29:30.657
Yeah. Give me Hollycourt 55377.

01:29:32.872 --> 01:29:37.333
Hello, it's Daddy.
Darling, put Mommy on the phone.

01:29:37.543 --> 01:29:42.704
Barbara, it's Richie. I ain't never
coming home no more. Take it easy.

01:29:51.558 --> 01:29:56.184
Then the son of a bitch had cars
and chauffeured everybody home.

01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.556
Anybody see Quick?

01:29:59.774 --> 01:30:04.851
Nobody has seen him on the street
at all. But he'll show up eventually.

01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:07.692
For the time being,
Sugar Ray's is closed.

01:30:07.907 --> 01:30:11.905
For the time being?
I want it closed permanently.

01:31:01.127 --> 01:31:06.370
Ladies and gentlemen,
and now for the main event.

01:31:06.591 --> 01:31:11.834
Fighting out of Ireland,
weighing in at 250 pounds,

01:31:12.055 --> 01:31:13.763
the Irish iron man...

01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:19.640
...Michael Kirkpatrick!

01:31:20.688 --> 01:31:25.018
And fighting out of Harlem, New York,

01:31:25.235 --> 01:31:28.401
weighing in at 220 pounds,

01:31:28.613 --> 01:31:33.275
wearing maroon trunks
with a gold stripe,

01:31:33.493 --> 01:31:39.578
the Heavyweight Champion
of the World, Jack Jenkins.

01:31:48.591 --> 01:31:51.758
You received your instructions
in the dressing room.

01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:56.133
I want a nice clean fight.
Shake hands and come out fighting.

01:31:57.308 --> 01:32:01.887
Don't take this ass-whipping
personally.

01:32:04.941 --> 01:32:06.732
JACK JENKINS

01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:16.156
There's the bell for round one.

01:32:44.355 --> 01:32:47.143
Doesn't look like
he's trying to throw this fight.

01:33:51.047 --> 01:33:53.123
Come on, Willie!

01:34:30.086 --> 01:34:31.710
Sunshine.

01:35:06.373 --> 01:35:09.290
- Hello, darling dear.
- Hey, sweet daddy.

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.997
- That's a lot of numbers, baby.
- I know. Throw them in the trunk.

01:35:25.016 --> 01:35:27.424
l'll get that door. Here.

01:35:27.978 --> 01:35:30.766
- Thanks, Richie.
- You're welcome, baby.

01:35:42.827 --> 01:35:46.658
- I really missed you, sweet daddy.
- Me, too, sweet mommy.

01:35:48.791 --> 01:35:50.583
I got a big surprise...

01:35:53.462 --> 01:35:55.040
Are you blind?

01:35:58.884 --> 01:36:01.506
Jesus, the cops are coming.

01:36:01.721 --> 01:36:03.879
Take it easy, just relax.

01:36:04.098 --> 01:36:06.090
Not tonight, fuck me.

01:36:18.279 --> 01:36:21.149
- You are in trouble.
- That light was green.

01:36:21.365 --> 01:36:26.110
No, sir, it was red.
But that's the least of your problems.

01:36:26.328 --> 01:36:30.029
- Do you know who you got in the car?
- Who?

01:36:30.249 --> 01:36:33.120
Lady Heroin.
We've been tracking her all night.

01:36:33.335 --> 01:36:37.285
- She put 40lbs of smack in your trunk.
- Heroin?

01:36:38.674 --> 01:36:41.046
Step out of the car, please, sir.

01:36:42.136 --> 01:36:45.885
- I don't know nothing about this.
- You, too, Miss Heroin.

01:36:47.808 --> 01:36:52.803
So, Lady Heroin,
we finally caught you, right?

01:36:53.021 --> 01:36:56.521
Got your boy, too. You are both
going to jail for a long time.

01:36:56.734 --> 01:37:00.518
Wait a minute, I ain't no boy.
I just met her this week.

01:37:00.738 --> 01:37:03.608
- l'm sorry, Richie.
- Don't sorry me.

01:37:03.824 --> 01:37:06.778
- l'm sorry, baby.
- Don't 'baby' me.

01:37:06.994 --> 01:37:10.197
l'm in trouble here.
l'm dying in the street.

01:37:10.414 --> 01:37:13.748
You should have told me
your last name was Heroin.

01:37:13.959 --> 01:37:16.665
That doesn't mean you have to sell it.

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:31.472
- What do we have here, officers?
- Lady Heroin and her boyfriend.

01:37:31.686 --> 01:37:34.805
- This guy?
- Can I speak to you privately?

01:37:35.022 --> 01:37:36.433
You want to confess?

01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:40.480
Officers, this is our collar
and we'll handle it.

01:37:40.694 --> 01:37:44.988
Relax, boy. You're out of your territory,
so just cool it. Come here.

01:37:48.119 --> 01:37:49.661
Talk to me.

01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:52.408
- You know Phil Cantone?
- We work for him.

01:37:52.623 --> 01:37:57.166
Tell these jigs to get out of here.
l'm doing a run for Bugsy.

01:37:57.378 --> 01:38:00.165
- Why didn't you say?
- I just did.

01:38:03.509 --> 01:38:06.925
Take this girl and let this guy
go about his business.

01:38:07.138 --> 01:38:11.052
First of all, this guy is an accessory,
and what we're going to do...

01:38:11.267 --> 01:38:16.973
You're going to do nothing. We'll take it
from here. Thank you, officers.

01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:20.024
All right, take her.

01:38:20.234 --> 01:38:24.943
- Thanks for the help.
- Get out of here and stay out of trouble.

01:38:26.991 --> 01:38:31.949
Jenkins drives him against the ropes.
He's got him pinned against the ropes.

01:38:32.204 --> 01:38:33.615
He's hitting him hard.

01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:48.218
What?

01:38:48.429 --> 01:38:49.757
Fuck!

01:40:01.418 --> 01:40:03.660
How are you doing, boys?

01:40:07.675 --> 01:40:09.798
It's real good to see you.

01:40:15.141 --> 01:40:17.596
Maybe you can clear something up.

01:40:18.936 --> 01:40:24.606
I mean, I thought you might pull
something so I followed Vento tonight.

01:40:24.817 --> 01:40:29.978
And l've got to tell you, the whole thing
was going pretty cute...

01:40:32.283 --> 01:40:37.359
...until some real boys showed up.
They spoiled it for you guys.

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:41.162
You did the right thing
to let them go and not start any shit.

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.124
But the one thing I can't figure out

01:40:47.339 --> 01:40:52.678
is why you would break into a bank
that's been closed for five years.

01:40:54.930 --> 01:40:57.468
Why would you do that?

01:40:59.769 --> 01:41:02.473
- May I?
- Please do.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.983
We figured with Vento doing
a pick-up as big as this,

01:41:09.195 --> 01:41:13.062
that Bugsy would have his number-one
boy tailing him. That's you.

01:41:15.117 --> 01:41:20.622
And the cops that pulled us over,
you win some and you lose some.

01:41:20.832 --> 01:41:25.292
As far as us breaking into a bank
that's been closed for five years,

01:41:25.503 --> 01:41:30.248
we're not making a withdrawal...
we're making a deposit.

01:41:32.009 --> 01:41:34.879
A deposit? No bullshit?

01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:42.139
What's that supposed to mean?

01:41:42.353 --> 01:41:45.058
It means put down your gun.

01:41:56.867 --> 01:41:59.785
We'll tell the police on Monday
you are here.

01:41:59.995 --> 01:42:03.162
Ray, these things
don't have much air in them.

01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:08.415
Jimmy estimates there are
a couple of days of air in here.

01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:13.587
Who is Jimmy? Is he a scientist?
He measures the fucking air?

01:42:14.802 --> 01:42:19.179
- Jimmy, was that the right calculation?
- Give or take a couple of hours.

01:42:20.474 --> 01:42:23.890
There you go.
Give or take an hour or two.

01:42:24.979 --> 01:42:28.145
I might see you again.

01:42:29.274 --> 01:42:32.359
- Yeah, you might.
- I might.

01:42:33.862 --> 01:42:35.522
Goodnight.

01:42:37.325 --> 01:42:39.650
Take very short breaths.

01:42:42.413 --> 01:42:44.536
Maybe, if you breathe like this...

01:42:44.749 --> 01:42:47.536
But if you go...
you're a dead motherfucker.

01:43:21.952 --> 01:43:24.324
Is he crazy?

01:43:27.166 --> 01:43:30.083
l'll put an end
to this Sugar Ray shit tonight.

01:43:30.294 --> 01:43:34.042
- What's with all the sad faces?
- Give me my money and get out.

01:43:46.435 --> 01:43:48.344
What's this?

01:43:49.939 --> 01:43:54.517
- Where's my money?
- They took the wrong bag.

01:43:54.735 --> 01:43:59.693
- Who took the wrong bag?
- I had an accident and the cops came.

01:43:59.907 --> 01:44:05.114
- Why would the cops take my money?
- They thought it was heroin.

01:44:05.329 --> 01:44:06.788
Heroin?

01:44:07.957 --> 01:44:11.041
Richie, why would they think
it was heroin?

01:44:11.252 --> 01:44:13.921
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:44:14.964 --> 01:44:18.629
I had Lady Heroin in the car with me.
I was falling in love with her.

01:44:18.842 --> 01:44:23.551
I thought I was. She put heroin
in the trunk with the money.

01:44:23.764 --> 01:44:28.225
Then I was going through
this green light that was red, and...

01:44:28.436 --> 01:44:30.511
Mr Calhoune, l'm sorry.

01:44:30.729 --> 01:44:33.517
You're sorry?
What are you, fucking retarded?

01:44:33.733 --> 01:44:38.441
No, it's OK. The cops who took
the money were Cantone's guys.

01:44:38.654 --> 01:44:40.232
How do you know?

01:44:40.448 --> 01:44:44.694
There were four cops. The first two
were jigs. Then came Cantone's guys.

01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:47.033
Get Cantone on the phone.

01:44:47.246 --> 01:44:52.038
Why would they take your money
and leave the dope?

01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:56.000
They made a mistake
and took the wrong bag.

01:44:57.756 --> 01:45:03.131
You gave a million dollars of my money
to the cops for a bag of heroin?

01:45:04.305 --> 01:45:07.092
What are you, a fucking moron?

01:45:11.895 --> 01:45:13.224
Yes.

01:45:24.116 --> 01:45:27.816
This isn't heroin. It's sugar.

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:34.914
That son of a bitch.
That goddamn son of a bitch.

01:45:35.127 --> 01:45:37.832
There's no answer, boss. He's not in.

01:45:38.047 --> 01:45:41.131
It's a woman named Vera.
Says she works for Ray.

01:45:44.095 --> 01:45:47.629
Clean up that mess. Let her in.

01:45:59.652 --> 01:46:03.863
l'm sorry, Mr Calhoune.
But I didn't have nothing to do with it.

01:46:04.073 --> 01:46:07.109
Won't you have a seat?

01:46:08.369 --> 01:46:12.034
I wanted to warn you,
but Sugar would have killed me.

01:46:12.248 --> 01:46:14.869
His son already shot off
my pinkie toe.

01:46:15.083 --> 01:46:19.212
No, is that right?
l'm sorry to hear that, Miss...

01:46:19.421 --> 01:46:21.249
Walker. Vera Walker.

01:46:21.465 --> 01:46:24.668
Mick, get Miss Walker
something to drink.

01:46:24.885 --> 01:46:29.594
I had nothing to do with it, Mr Calhoune.
l'm no thief.

01:46:29.807 --> 01:46:32.974
l'm an honest whore,
and all my whores are honest.

01:46:33.185 --> 01:46:37.764
We didn't want to have nothing to do
with this, but they made us keep quiet.

01:46:37.981 --> 01:46:42.229
I wanted to tell you, Mr Calhoune,
but I knew they'd have killed me.

01:46:42.445 --> 01:46:45.944
Maybe you could help us locate
Mr Ray and Mr Quick.

01:46:47.866 --> 01:46:52.114
They are over at Ray's.
But please, don't tell them I told you.

01:46:52.330 --> 01:46:55.331
I still have nine toes
and I want to keep them.

01:46:55.541 --> 01:46:59.206
I just want to go about my business
with nobody after me.

01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:04.627
l'm an old woman, Mr Calhoune,
and I can't stand this fighting no more.

01:47:05.467 --> 01:47:08.967
Tony, would you give Miss Walker
my phone number?

01:47:09.179 --> 01:47:12.216
If you have any problems, just call me.

01:47:12.433 --> 01:47:15.469
Thank you so much, Mr Calhoune.

01:47:17.104 --> 01:47:19.393
And thank you, too, sir.

01:47:19.606 --> 01:47:22.773
- Goodnight to you all.
- Please see Miss Walker out.

01:47:31.911 --> 01:47:33.737
Get the car.

01:47:35.873 --> 01:47:40.950
We're going to pay
Mr Ray and Mr Quick a visit.

01:48:31.429 --> 01:48:33.337
Hey, boss...

01:48:35.975 --> 01:48:38.430
It's Cantone's badge.

01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.805
Let me see that.

01:48:50.489 --> 01:48:53.490
What the hell is going on here? Phil?

01:48:58.581 --> 01:49:00.739
Nobody touch anyhing.

01:49:02.167 --> 01:49:04.919
I got to figure this out.

01:49:05.129 --> 01:49:07.667
I got to figure out the right move.

01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:19.141
It's a set-up. It's a fucking set-up.

01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:21.640
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:49:34.575 --> 01:49:39.237
Let's get moving before somebody
comes looking for us.

01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:57.389
I want to thank you gentlemen
very much. We appreciate it.

01:49:57.598 --> 01:50:01.382
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- Take care, guys. Thanks.

01:50:03.354 --> 01:50:09.107
l'm sure going to miss that place.
You know we can never go back.

01:50:09.318 --> 01:50:14.145
There are other cities. We'll find
someplace else and start again.

01:50:14.365 --> 01:50:16.606
There's no place like Harlem.

01:50:16.825 --> 01:50:20.360
You ain't lying, Sugar.
Let me look at it one last time.

01:50:20.579 --> 01:50:24.624
Don't waste your time.
Put your blind ass in the car.

01:50:24.833 --> 01:50:28.748
l'm going to kick your ass
if you keep talking to me like that.

01:50:32.549 --> 01:50:35.800
- Where do you want to go, Pop?
- I don't know, son.

01:50:36.012 --> 01:50:39.594
We've got a tank full of gas
and a trunk full of money.

01:50:41.684 --> 01:50:46.393
- That sounds like a sweet combination.
- Sweet as sugar.
