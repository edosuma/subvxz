(Man)

00:04.375 --> 00:07.834
So, drop that taco 'cause

00:04.375 --> 00:07.834
it's time for "Toilet Wars."

00:08.959 --> 00:10.583

Come on, please? Just do it.

(Henry)

00:10.625 --> 00:11.500
No.

00:11.542 --> 00:12.667
Why not?

00:12.709 --> 00:14.875
Piper, I said no and

00:12.709 --> 00:14.875
no means no, okay?

00:14.917 --> 00:16.417
I don't have time

00:14.917 --> 00:16.417
for this, okay?

00:16.458 --> 00:17.750
Why not?

00:16.458 --> 00:17.750
I have a girlfriend.

00:17.792 --> 00:19.166
I have a job.

00:17.792 --> 00:19.166
What are you talking about?

00:19.208 --> 00:20.291
(yelling all at once)

00:20.333 --> 00:21.458
(screaming)

00:25.083 --> 00:26.500
Dad, will you talk to him?

00:27.083 --> 00:29.625
Look what I'm painting.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.625
It's called a "g'nome".

00:30.834 --> 00:31.792
It's gorgeous.

00:31.834 --> 00:33.583
Now will you please tell Henry

00:33.625 --> 00:35.750
that he should coach

00:33.625 --> 00:35.750
my basketball team?

00:35.792 --> 00:36.750
The Woodpeckers

00:35.792 --> 00:36.750
need a new coach?

00:37.291 --> 00:37.917
Yes.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.125
I'll do it.

00:39.458 --> 00:40.125
No. Gross.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.125
We want you.

00:42.458 --> 00:43.583
Oh.

00:45.250 --> 00:46.250
No.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.125
(doorbell rings)

00:48.834 --> 00:49.583
I'll get it.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.333
Henry.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.500
I have to pay attention to

00:52.667 --> 00:54.500
the opening of our front door.

00:54.542 --> 00:55.583
(laughs)

00:56.291 --> 00:57.375
Sushi Dushi.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.208
Hey.

01:00.875 --> 01:03.041
Uh, I think I left

01:00.875 --> 01:03.041
my wallet upstairs.

01:03.917 --> 01:04.834
Well, go get it.

01:05.834 --> 01:06.458
Right.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.291
Hey.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.500
Yo. Sushi guy.

01:11.041 --> 01:11.667
Yeah, what's up?

01:12.166 --> 01:13.959
Can you believe

01:12.166 --> 01:13.959
I have a brother

01:14.000 --> 01:16.625
who refuses to coach

01:14.000 --> 01:16.625
my basketball team?

01:16.667 --> 01:18.208
Piper, this guy doesn't

01:16.667 --> 01:18.208
care about us

01:18.250 --> 01:19.375
or your basketball team.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.333
Actually, I care very much.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.208
See? He cares.

01:25.750 --> 01:26.500
Why do you care?

01:26.542 --> 01:27.917
(laughs)

01:27.959 --> 01:30.375
Well, because my kid brother,

01:27.959 --> 01:30.375
Ricky, when he was ten,

01:30.417 --> 01:33.125
he asked me to coach

01:30.417 --> 01:33.125
his little league baseball team.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.542
But I said I was too busy,

01:33.166 --> 01:35.542
like a fool.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.291
Dad, the sushi guy's waiting!

01:39.542 --> 01:40.750
So, what happened?

01:41.041 --> 01:42.458
Ricky quit baseball.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.250
Then, when he turned 18,

01:42.500 --> 01:45.250
he became a bull fighter.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.792
Okay, see? That's exciting.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.792
Things turned out good.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.000
No. Because on Ricky's very

01:48.500 --> 01:51.000
first bull fight, he got gored.

01:51.875 --> 01:53.917
(Piper)

01:51.875 --> 01:53.917
Oh my gosh, is he okay?

01:54.291 --> 01:56.625
Eh, he's sort of okay.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.542
As long as he's not

01:56.667 --> 01:58.542
sitting down.

01:58.583 --> 01:59.542
Or standing up.

01:59.583 --> 02:00.667
(laughs)

02:00.709 --> 02:01.792
Poor kid.

02:02.166 --> 02:03.458
Oh, why didn't

02:02.166 --> 02:03.458
I just say yes

02:03.500 --> 02:05.250
when he asked me

02:03.500 --> 02:05.250
to coach his team?

02:12.875 --> 02:14.792
(laughs)

02:15.542 --> 02:16.625
(blows whistle)

02:16.667 --> 02:18.583
Come on, Woodpeckers!

02:16.667 --> 02:18.583
Show me some hustle!

02:24.458 --> 02:25.750
What's that,

02:24.458 --> 02:25.750
a taco salad?

02:27.709 --> 02:28.458
Yeah.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.125
Okay, now let's see a lay-up!

02:32.166 --> 02:32.959
(Kids)

02:32.166 --> 02:32.959
What?

02:33.000 --> 02:33.709
What's a lay-up?

02:33.750 --> 02:35.000
(laughs)

02:35.041 --> 02:36.750
(blows whistle)

02:37.417 --> 02:38.041
Catch!

02:38.542 --> 02:39.625
(grunts)

02:39.667 --> 02:40.291
Whoa!

02:41.625 --> 02:43.834
(grunting)

02:41.625 --> 02:43.834
(groaning)

02:49.291 --> 02:51.375
Aw.

02:53.041 --> 02:53.875
Dang it.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.834
Why would you put your taco

02:54.667 --> 02:56.834
salad right where I'm sitting?

02:56.875 --> 02:59.291
(laughs)

03:01.917 --> 03:03.083
It all just kind of happened.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.792
My dad was

03:03.125 --> 03:05.792
an irresponsible scientist.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.250
I wanted an after-school job.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.834
(Captain Man)

03:07.750 --> 03:09.834
And by accident,

03:07.750 --> 03:09.834
he made me indestructible.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.458
Ah!

03:11.500 --> 03:13.250
(Henry)

03:11.500 --> 03:13.250
I went into this crazy store

03:13.917 --> 03:15.750
and met

03:13.917 --> 03:15.750
a pretty interesting guy.

03:15.792 --> 03:16.875
I'm going to blow your mind.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.875
Now I protect

03:17.583 --> 03:19.875
the good citizens of Swellview

03:19.917 --> 03:20.875
who call me...

03:20.917 --> 03:22.000
(Henry)

03:20.917 --> 03:22.000
And he turned out to be...

03:22.041 --> 03:22.959
You know the name.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.041
Captain Man!

03:24.083 --> 03:25.250
That's right, Henry.

03:25.291 --> 03:27.917
In time, I realized

03:25.291 --> 03:27.917
that being a superhero

03:27.959 --> 03:29.166
is a lot to handle alone.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.583
He wanted some help.

03:30.625 --> 03:31.750
(Captain Man)

03:30.625 --> 03:31.750
I needed a sidekick.

03:32.166 --> 03:33.709
(Henry)

03:32.166 --> 03:33.709
I, Henry hart...

03:33.750 --> 03:35.083
(Captain Man)

03:33.750 --> 03:35.083
Pledge to never ever ever...

03:33.750 --> 03:35.083
tell anyone...

03:35.125 --> 03:36.583
That I'm Captain Man's

03:35.125 --> 03:36.583
secret sidekick.

03:36.917 --> 03:37.750
It is done.

03:37.792 --> 03:39.083
(Henry)

03:37.792 --> 03:39.083
Now we blow bubbles.

03:39.125 --> 03:40.333
(Captain Man)

03:39.125 --> 03:40.333
And fight crime.

03:40.375 --> 03:41.542

03:40.375 --> 03:41.542
Feels good.

How was your camping trip?

04:11.458 --> 04:13.375
Oh, it was so much fun.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.417
I went swimming

04:13.417 --> 04:15.417
in Lake Swellview.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.500
Yeah. Which would've

04:15.792 --> 04:17.500
been great

04:17.542 --> 04:18.917
if he'd brought

04:17.542 --> 04:18.917
a swimsuit.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.375
(laughs)

04:20.709 --> 04:22.625
What's wrong

04:20.709 --> 04:22.625
with swimming naked?

04:22.667 --> 04:24.125
You were scaring the fish.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.250
(laughs)

04:26.291 --> 04:28.333
I'm going to my room

(laughing)

04:32.125 --> 04:33.500
You call that a beard?

04:34.583 --> 04:36.083
Yeah. What else

04:34.583 --> 04:36.083
would I call this?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.875
You could call it

04:36.500 --> 04:37.875
a face bush.

04:37.917 --> 04:39.291
(laughs)

04:39.333 --> 04:44.000
I'm just saying this is

04:39.333 --> 04:44.000
the start of a real man's beard.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.750
Pish.

04:46.792 --> 04:49.583
I can grow more hair on my rump

04:46.792 --> 04:49.583
than you can grow on your face.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.750
Your rump is no match

04:50.000 --> 04:51.750
for my face.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.959
All right, boys, let's not

04:53.041 --> 04:55.959
go getting all stupid.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.500
You guys should have

04:56.000 --> 04:57.500
a beard battle.

04:57.792 --> 04:58.750
Yes.

04:58.792 --> 04:59.500
Dude.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.125
Six weeks.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.583
Whoever grows

05:02.166 --> 05:03.583
the biggest beard wins.

05:04.542 --> 05:05.917
And the loser has to...

05:06.792 --> 05:08.667
Eat the winner's beard hair.

05:11.083 --> 05:11.834

05:13.125 --> 05:16.041
go getting all stupid.

05:21.333 --> 05:21.959
Okay.

You guys are the Woodpeckers.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.917

05:26.000 --> 05:27.917
the worst team in the league.

No, no, no.

See, no, that's a bad thing.

05:31.917 --> 05:33.583
(laughs)

05:34.834 --> 05:37.417
See, you just have

05:34.834 --> 05:37.417
to practice hard

05:37.458 --> 05:39.500
and have a winning attitude

05:39.542 --> 05:42.625
in order to not be the worst.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.750
So, what's our goal?

05:49.125 --> 05:50.875

07:25.792 --> 07:27.041
with you guys?

07:27.709 --> 07:29.208
We're only down by three.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.000
Well, you'd be winning

07:31.041 --> 07:32.417
if you'd listen

07:31.041 --> 07:32.417
to what I keep telling you.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.083
Now, Jacob, you got

07:33.000 --> 07:35.083
to protect the ball, all right?

07:35.125 --> 07:36.333
(Jacob)

07:35.125 --> 07:36.333
Okay.

07:36.375 --> 07:37.500
And Hannah,

07:36.375 --> 07:37.500
when we have the ball,

07:37.542 --> 07:39.083
you can't just stand there.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.083
Get open.

07:39.125 --> 07:39.750
Got it.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.333
Now, Piper, you got

07:40.792 --> 07:42.333
to quit being lazy

07:42.375 --> 07:43.667
on defense, all right?

07:42.375 --> 07:43.667
Move your feet.

07:44.166 --> 07:45.041
(horn blares)

07:45.083 --> 07:46.291
(Jasper)

07:45.083 --> 07:46.291
Whistle!

07:46.333 --> 07:47.792
(blows whistle)

07:47.834 --> 07:49.458
Woodpeckers, take the floor!

07:49.500 --> 07:50.834
All right, get out there

07:49.500 --> 07:50.834
and make me proud!

07:50.875 --> 07:51.875
Let's go!

07:55.834 --> 07:57.458
Hey! Woodpecker parents!

07:57.875 --> 07:59.542
I want to see you get up

07:57.875 --> 07:59.542
and make some noise

07:59.583 --> 08:00.250
for your kids!

08:00.875 --> 08:01.750
Come on!

08:01.792 --> 08:04.959
(cheers and applause)

08:05.000 --> 08:05.709
(Jasper)

08:05.000 --> 08:05.709
Whistle!

08:06.500 --> 08:08.083
(blows whistle)

08:09.083 --> 08:11.291
(cheers)

08:11.333 --> 08:15.792
♪♪

08:17.041 --> 08:17.709
Yeah!

08:20.375 --> 08:21.709
Piper, steal it!

08:27.291 --> 08:29.166
No, no, no!

08:27.291 --> 08:29.166
That basket! That basket!

08:31.709 --> 08:32.834
(cheering)

08:32.875 --> 08:34.542
(horn blares)

08:34.583 --> 08:37.583
(cheers and applause)

08:49.208 --> 08:50.375
Uh...hello?

08:50.709 --> 08:51.667
Hello, Henry.

08:52.583 --> 08:55.375
Hi. I got a message

08:52.583 --> 08:55.375
telling me to come here.

08:55.417 --> 08:57.667
We sent

08:55.417 --> 08:57.667
the message.

08:55.417 --> 08:57.667
We know.

08:57.709 --> 08:58.417
We're the board.

08:59.917 --> 09:00.959
The board?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.291
The Swellview Tween

09:01.000 --> 09:03.291
Athletic Board.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.250
STAB.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.500
(laughs)

09:06.542 --> 09:08.417
We're in charge of

09:06.542 --> 09:08.417
the junior basketball league.

09:08.792 --> 09:09.959
Please, sit down.

09:13.917 --> 09:15.458
Is it okay if I just stand?

09:15.500 --> 09:17.250
We prefer you sit.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.667
(laughs)

09:23.792 --> 09:25.709
(laughs)

09:29.417 --> 09:30.709
Could I have a bigger chair?

09:30.750 --> 09:32.000
(All)

09:30.750 --> 09:32.000
No.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.959
(laughs)

09:39.208 --> 09:41.125
Did... did I really do

09:39.208 --> 09:41.125
something wrong?

09:41.166 --> 09:43.041
Well, we don't like

09:41.166 --> 09:43.041
the word "wrong."

09:43.083 --> 09:44.709
But yes.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.709
You did

09:43.083 --> 09:44.709
something wrong.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.583
Come on,

09:48.125 --> 09:49.583
Woodpeckers!

09:49.625 --> 09:50.500
Be maniacs!

09:50.542 --> 09:53.041
Maniacs on the floor!

09:50.542 --> 09:53.041
Boom!

09:55.000 --> 09:56.417
Yeah?

09:56.458 --> 09:58.750
You can't shout

09:56.458 --> 09:58.750
at children like that.

09:58.792 --> 10:01.417
It could cause them

09:58.792 --> 10:01.417
to feel bad about themselves.

10:02.375 --> 10:03.875
But they didn't feel bad.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.792
They won, and they were

10:03.917 --> 10:05.792
really excited about it.

10:05.834 --> 10:06.834
Show him

10:05.834 --> 10:06.834
the other thing.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.959
Hey!

10:09.959 --> 10:11.959
Woodpecker parents!

10:12.000 --> 10:13.250
I want to see you get up

10:13.291 --> 10:14.583
and make some noise

10:13.291 --> 10:14.583
for your kids!

10:15.542 --> 10:16.166
Come on!

10:18.208 --> 10:19.500
I... I don't get it.

10:19.542 --> 10:20.750
(laughs)

10:20.792 --> 10:22.125
Clearly.

10:22.166 --> 10:24.583
Henry, you were urging

10:22.166 --> 10:24.583
the parents to cheer

10:24.625 --> 10:25.583
for their children.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.542
Loudly.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.166
So?

10:28.208 --> 10:30.208
Well, when they're cheering

10:28.208 --> 10:30.208
for their own children,

10:30.250 --> 10:32.625
that could make the other

10:30.250 --> 10:32.625
children feel less than.

10:32.917 --> 10:34.417
(laughs)

10:34.875 --> 10:36.625
I...

10:36.667 --> 10:38.667
I was just trying to teach

10:36.667 --> 10:38.667
the kids to play better and win.

10:38.709 --> 10:41.291
Well, that's not

10:38.709 --> 10:41.291
what a good coach does.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.500
I think it is.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.959
The goal is for all the children

10:47.041 --> 10:49.542
to have the exact

10:47.041 --> 10:49.542
same experience.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.291
So, please, no more

10:49.583 --> 10:52.291
shouting or criticizing.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.250
Only say nice

10:52.333 --> 10:54.250
positive things.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.667
All right, got it.

10:56.709 --> 10:59.834
And no more encouraging

10:56.709 --> 10:59.834
the parents to hoot and holler.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.583
(laughs)

11:01.625 --> 11:02.792
So...

11:02.834 --> 11:04.625
the parents can't cheer

11:02.834 --> 11:04.625
for their own kids?

11:04.667 --> 11:05.458
Correct.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.041
But they can applaud softly.

11:09.083 --> 11:09.709
Like this.

11:13.834 --> 11:14.750
Okay.

11:14.792 --> 11:15.709
Thank you

11:14.792 --> 11:15.709
for your time.

11:16.959 --> 11:19.125
(laughs)

11:26.875 --> 11:27.583
(elevator dings)

11:28.959 --> 11:29.750
(chatter)

11:30.500 --> 11:32.083
(Ray)

11:30.500 --> 11:32.083
I told you

11:30.500 --> 11:32.083
that poor crazy girl.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.208
(laughing)

11:43.500 --> 11:44.125
Schwoz!

11:44.166 --> 11:44.875
Ah!

11:44.917 --> 11:46.542
(laughs)

11:47.333 --> 11:49.000
Hi. Hey there.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.000
Hey.

11:50.917 --> 11:51.542
Cheater.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.625
You're a dirty cheater.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.208
Why is he a cheater?

11:55.917 --> 11:57.709
That machine

11:55.917 --> 11:57.709
is a B.E.D.

11:58.917 --> 12:00.542
A beard enhancement device.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.750
(laughs)

12:01.792 --> 12:02.625
No it's not.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.000
I swear.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.000
I swear to the gods it's not.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.709
I swear on my life.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.458
I swear on Charlotte's life.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.458
I'm telling the truth.

12:11.166 --> 12:11.959
No, you're lying.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Ah, so what?

12:13.041 --> 12:14.709
(laughs)

12:14.750 --> 12:16.667
You listen to me,

12:14.750 --> 12:16.667
you fuzzy little cheater, I--

12:16.709 --> 12:17.458
Hey!

12:18.417 --> 12:19.750
Nobody said there was a rule

12:19.792 --> 12:21.375
against using beard

12:19.792 --> 12:21.375
enhancement devices.

12:21.417 --> 12:22.083
Ha!

12:23.750 --> 12:25.583
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.333
Okay. Fine.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.500
I thought we were gonna

12:27.375 --> 12:29.500
have a fair and natural

12:27.375 --> 12:29.500
beard growing contest,

12:29.542 --> 12:31.208
but since we're not, maybe

12:29.542 --> 12:31.208
I'll just use this thing myself.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.625
Hey, get out

12:31.250 --> 12:32.625
of my machine.

12:32.667 --> 12:33.500
Hey.

12:32.667 --> 12:33.500
No.

12:33.542 --> 12:34.792
(Ray)

12:33.542 --> 12:34.792
What? I'm using it.

12:34.834 --> 12:36.792
Hey. Come on.

12:36.834 --> 12:38.083
No.

12:36.834 --> 12:38.083
Here we go.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.709
Ah!

12:38.125 --> 12:39.709
No, not the beard.

12:49.959 --> 12:51.125
Whistle!

12:51.166 --> 12:52.542
(blows whistle)

12:52.583 --> 12:53.291
Traveling!

12:53.333 --> 12:54.208
Armadillo's ball!

12:55.250 --> 12:56.208
(Henry)

12:55.250 --> 12:56.208
Come on, Jacob!

12:56.250 --> 12:57.917
I told you

12:56.250 --> 12:57.917
a thousand times that...

12:57.959 --> 12:58.625
(clears throat)

12:59.083 --> 12:59.709
That...

13:01.375 --> 13:02.709
that you're doing terrific!

13:02.750 --> 13:03.709
(laughing)

13:04.166 --> 13:05.500
Just like all you kids.

13:05.542 --> 13:07.834
You're all equal and terrific

13:05.542 --> 13:07.834
no matter what you do.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.583
(laughs)

13:16.291 --> 13:18.500
(cheering)

13:27.709 --> 13:28.333
Yeah!

13:28.375 --> 13:29.959
(cheering)

13:30.000 --> 13:31.125
(horn blaring)

13:31.166 --> 13:32.542
That's the game!

13:32.959 --> 13:34.709
Woodpeckers win!

13:35.458 --> 13:36.792
(Henry)

13:35.458 --> 13:36.792
Yeah, nice shot.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.250
You guys did it.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.041
You beat the best team

13:40.291 --> 13:42.041
in the league.

13:42.792 --> 13:45.125
I think that makes us

13:42.792 --> 13:45.125
the best team in the league.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.291
(Kids)

13:45.166 --> 13:46.291
Yeah.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.250
(talking all at once)

13:49.208 --> 13:49.959
(Henry)

13:49.208 --> 13:49.959
Yeah we are.

13:50.417 --> 13:52.500
And Sophie,

13:50.417 --> 13:52.500
you were our high scorer.

13:53.083 --> 13:53.834
I was?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.417
Yep.

13:55.458 --> 13:56.542
And that means you get...

13:58.583 --> 13:59.542
this.

14:00.959 --> 14:02.250
Wow.

14:02.291 --> 14:05.166
Awesome trophy, Sophie.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.375
(Henry)

14:05.500 --> 14:06.375
Great job, kid.

14:06.417 --> 14:07.875
I'm really proud of you.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.375
(laughs)

14:11.417 --> 14:13.500
(Ms. Weiner)

14:11.417 --> 14:13.500
Henry, I assume

14:11.417 --> 14:13.500
you know the problem.

14:13.875 --> 14:14.583
Yeah.

14:15.542 --> 14:17.458
You always freeze frame

14:15.542 --> 14:17.458
on my face looking hideous.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.291
You gave that little girl

14:18.500 --> 14:21.291
a trophy.

14:21.625 --> 14:22.625
So?

14:22.667 --> 14:25.333
So, you gave her

14:22.667 --> 14:25.333
special attention

14:25.375 --> 14:27.291
that the other children

14:25.375 --> 14:27.291
didn't get.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.125
That's disgusting.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.083
(laughs)

14:30.125 --> 14:31.875
Why? That's Sophie.

14:31.917 --> 14:33.500
She's been practicing

14:31.917 --> 14:33.500
harder than anyone.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.000
And she was the best player.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.917
No, all the children

14:35.041 --> 14:38.917
were the best players.

14:38.959 --> 14:40.166
Don't you see?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.959
I really don't.

14:42.834 --> 14:45.208
Henry, please, just admit

14:42.834 --> 14:45.208
that what you did was terrible.

14:45.583 --> 14:46.792
It was disgusting.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.000
Okay, so,

14:48.750 --> 14:51.000
what do you want me to do?

14:51.041 --> 14:53.417
Take the cool trophy away

14:51.041 --> 14:53.417
from the sweet little girl,

14:53.458 --> 14:55.291
and give everyone a trophy?

14:59.375 --> 15:00.625
Congratulations, Jacob.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.041
You get

15:00.667 --> 15:02.041
this participation award.

15:03.041 --> 15:05.542
(laughs)

15:07.291 --> 15:08.542
Congratulations, Piper.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.166
Yeah, thanks.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.166
This means so much.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.834
(laughs)

15:14.291 --> 15:15.667
Sorry, Sophie.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.041
I'm going to have to

15:16.417 --> 15:18.041
take that back from you.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.041
But why?

15:19.417 --> 15:21.834
Apparently it's disgusting.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.500
(laughs)

15:27.166 --> 15:28.583
(laughs)

15:33.291 --> 15:35.625
(laughs)

15:44.208 --> 15:44.917
(Ray)

15:44.208 --> 15:44.917
Hey.

15:44.959 --> 15:45.625
(Schwoz)

15:44.959 --> 15:45.625
Hello.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.041
(laughs)

15:53.959 --> 15:54.875
The...

15:55.917 --> 15:57.834
beard enhancement device

15:55.917 --> 15:57.834
works really well.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.083
(laughs)

16:00.125 --> 16:02.959
Also, you dribbled

16:00.125 --> 16:02.959
on your sweater.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.667
(laughs)

16:11.959 --> 16:12.583
Jasper?

16:13.583 --> 16:15.250
What are you

16:13.583 --> 16:15.250
doing up there?

16:15.291 --> 16:16.333
I'm lowering this basket.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.041
Lowering the--

16:17.417 --> 16:18.375
Why?

16:18.417 --> 16:20.083
She told me if I didn't,

16:20.125 --> 16:22.041
the board would take away

16:20.125 --> 16:22.041
my whistle.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.625
(laughs)

16:24.792 --> 16:25.625
Hey, what's going on?

16:27.250 --> 16:29.250
(laughs)

16:29.583 --> 16:31.625
You brought the tiny chair?

16:42.959 --> 16:45.375
(laughs)

16:45.875 --> 16:47.667
Your Woodpeckers

16:45.875 --> 16:47.667
have become a problem.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.875
They've been scoring

16:47.709 --> 16:49.875
too many points.

16:49.917 --> 16:52.291
So we're lowering the basket

16:49.917 --> 16:52.291
for the other teams

16:52.333 --> 16:53.166
to make the

16:52.333 --> 16:53.166
game fair.

16:53.542 --> 16:54.542
Oh my God.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.667
Henry, our job

16:56.750 --> 16:59.667
as decent adults

16:59.709 --> 17:02.125
is to make sure

16:59.709 --> 17:02.125
that no child ever loses.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.000
Or feels bad.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.083
But don't you get it?

17:06.125 --> 17:08.625
Sometimes it's good

17:06.125 --> 17:08.625
when a kid loses and feels bad.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.125
Oh my God.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.125
No he didn't.

17:10.166 --> 17:10.792
That's disgusting.

17:12.458 --> 17:15.041
No, no, see,

17:15.083 --> 17:17.125
the Woodpeckers used

17:15.083 --> 17:17.125
to lose and feel bad

17:17.166 --> 17:19.750
but that's what made them

17:17.166 --> 17:19.750
want to practice harder

17:19.792 --> 17:20.875
and get better,

17:20.917 --> 17:22.542
and now they're winning

17:20.917 --> 17:22.542
and feel great.

17:23.083 --> 17:23.917
Don't you see?

17:24.959 --> 17:27.583
Sometimes kids need

17:24.959 --> 17:27.583
to experience failure

17:27.625 --> 17:29.417
in order to grow

17:27.625 --> 17:29.417
and learn how to be--

17:29.458 --> 17:30.583
(laughs)

17:30.625 --> 17:31.500
(Jasper)

17:30.625 --> 17:31.500
Hey! Who turned off the--

17:31.542 --> 17:33.709
(crash)

17:31.542 --> 17:33.709
(thud)

17:35.333 --> 17:36.959
(laughs)

17:39.250 --> 17:41.500
I'll find another boy

17:39.250 --> 17:41.500
to lower the basket.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.125
Beard contest.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.208
Dumbest thing I ever heard.

17:51.250 --> 17:51.917
(elevator dings)

17:55.458 --> 17:56.208
(Ray)

17:55.458 --> 17:56.208
Hey, Charlotte.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.291
Hi, Charlotte.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.166
All right, I'm ready to...

17:59.917 --> 18:01.583
Notice anything different?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.709
Yeah, what happened

18:03.667 --> 18:05.709
to your beards?

18:05.750 --> 18:07.250
Well, they were

18:05.750 --> 18:07.250
too long and itchy.

18:07.291 --> 18:08.834
Yeah, so uncomfortable.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.667
Yeah, that whole beard

18:08.875 --> 18:11.667
contest thing was a stupid idea.

18:11.709 --> 18:12.500
So stupid.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.041
Oh, really?

18:15.083 --> 18:17.875
But you know that woman,

18:15.083 --> 18:17.875
Vasilla, who knows how to knit?

18:18.208 --> 18:18.834
No.

18:19.542 --> 18:20.792
Well, she's a woman.

18:21.625 --> 18:25.125
And we had her

18:21.625 --> 18:25.125
make you... this.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.125
(Both)

18:25.166 --> 18:26.125
Ta da.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.041
It's a sweater.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.667
Made from our

18:29.417 --> 18:31.667
beard hair.

18:33.291 --> 18:34.792
Thank you so much.

18:39.583 --> 18:43.709
(cheering)

18:46.667 --> 18:48.375
Time out! Time out! Time out!

18:48.417 --> 18:49.417
Whistle!

18:49.458 --> 18:51.500
(blows whistle)

18:51.542 --> 18:53.834
Time out, Woodpeckers!

18:56.458 --> 18:57.375
Come on, we can't give up.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.291
This game isn't even fair.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.125
(talking all at once)

19:02.834 --> 19:04.291
Yeah, you're right.

19:05.417 --> 19:06.125
This game isn't fair.

19:07.792 --> 19:10.291
So, we could just give up

19:07.792 --> 19:10.291
and go home.

19:11.125 --> 19:12.208
(chatter)

19:12.250 --> 19:13.834
No, no, no.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.834
Wait, wait, wait.

19:13.875 --> 19:17.083
No, no. I was just taking

19:13.875 --> 19:17.083
a dramatic pause.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.458
(laughs)

19:18.500 --> 19:19.542
Okay, what are you saying?

19:20.834 --> 19:21.542
I'm saying...

19:28.417 --> 19:30.166
Piper, quit playing so lazy.

19:30.625 --> 19:31.917
When you're on defense,

19:30.625 --> 19:31.917
keep your hands up.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.709
Okay.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.291
All right, Tyler, Hannah,

19:33.750 --> 19:35.291
you got to play smarter.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.458
If you don't have a clear shot,

19:35.333 --> 19:37.458
pass the ball like I taught you.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.375
Got it, Coach.

19:38.417 --> 19:39.375
(Henry)

19:38.417 --> 19:39.375
All right, Sophie,

19:39.834 --> 19:41.166
I want to see you hustling up

19:39.834 --> 19:41.166
and down this court

19:41.291 --> 19:42.625
or tomorrow you're running laps.

19:41.291 --> 19:42.625
You hear me?

19:42.667 --> 19:43.875
Yeah, Coach.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.750
All right, and Steve,

19:43.917 --> 19:45.750
put the taco salad down.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.500
(laughs)

19:48.542 --> 19:49.792
(Jasper)

19:48.542 --> 19:49.792
Whistle!

19:50.291 --> 19:51.333
(blows whistle)

19:51.375 --> 19:53.375
All right, get out there

19:51.375 --> 19:53.375
and be the best!

19:53.417 --> 19:55.917
(cheering)

19:55.959 --> 19:58.458
And you, Woodpecker parents,

19:58.500 --> 20:01.625
get off your aging butts

19:58.500 --> 20:01.625
and cheer for your kids.

20:02.291 --> 20:06.917
(cheers and applause)

20:14.250 --> 20:14.875
Yeah!

20:31.959 --> 20:32.709
Let's go!

20:41.417 --> 20:42.959
(horn blaring)

20:43.000 --> 20:46.875
(cheers and applause)

20:54.625 --> 20:56.000
You've got a lot of nerve,

20:54.625 --> 20:56.000
Henry Hart.

20:56.709 --> 20:57.542
Thanks.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.583
(laughs)

21:01.875 --> 21:02.959
And I got you guys

21:01.875 --> 21:02.959
something, too.

21:06.083 --> 21:09.125
Congratulations,

21:06.083 --> 21:09.125
you get this useless award.

21:09.166 --> 21:11.417
(laughs)

21:11.917 --> 21:14.792
Congratulations,

21:11.917 --> 21:14.792
you get this pointless award.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.709
(laughs)

21:16.750 --> 21:20.250
Congratulations,

21:16.750 --> 21:20.250
you get this disgusting award.

21:20.291 --> 21:21.500
(laughs)

21:24.166 --> 21:25.625
Bleh, la, la, la, la.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.625
See you, STAB.

21:26.208 --> 21:27.709
(laughs)

21:28.208 --> 21:29.250
Hey, you guys won.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.166
I know.

21:30.458 --> 21:31.834
Well, come on, I'll take

21:30.458 --> 21:31.834
you and your team

21:31.875 --> 21:32.834
and Charlotte

21:31.875 --> 21:32.834
out to celebrate.

21:32.875 --> 21:33.542
Okay.

21:34.583 --> 21:35.542
Where's Charlotte?

21:35.583 --> 21:36.917
She--

21:35.583 --> 21:36.917
Charlotte?

21:38.500 --> 21:39.291
Charlotte!

21:42.750 --> 21:45.667
(laughs)

21:49.917 --> 21:50.917
What are you wearing?

21:52.542 --> 21:53.500
Beard hair.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.500
(makes goofy noises)

21:56.542 --> 21:58.667
(laughs)

21:59.458 --> 22:00.375
That's disgusting.

22:05.625 --> 22:10.542
♪♪

22:28.834 --> 22:30.417
(oven bell)

22:28.834 --> 22:30.417
Mmm...
