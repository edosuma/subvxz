WEBVTT

03:14.600 --> 03:16.443
Is that Estermont?

03:17.040 --> 03:18.963
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.964
The Sapphire Isle.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.728
Why are we on a merchant ship?
Why no Lannister sails?

03:33.800 --> 03:35.564
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.325
We'll get off earlier,
not far from Sunspear,

03:38.400 --> 03:40.880
row ourselves to the Dornish shore
in the night.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.044
You ever been to Dorne?

03:44.160 --> 03:45.889
- No.
- I have.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.689
The Dornish are crazy.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.286
All they want to do
is fight and fuck, fuck and fight.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.442
You should be happy to go back then.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.891
There's nothing like a good fight
to get you in the mood for fucking.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.042
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

04:00.120 --> 04:02.566
to clear your head for the next fight.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.369
It's how the two work together.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.489
Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting.
Well, I am.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.250
But I don't imagine
we'll get to stick around for the rest.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.004
Not after we've kidnapped their princess.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.082
We're not kidnapping their princess.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.369
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.440
Your niece?

04:27.840 --> 04:30.241
I've been doing this a long time.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.129
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.089
I know. Why are you here?

04:34.520 --> 04:36.682
Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?

04:37.200 --> 04:38.725
Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.170
Because I don't want to start a war.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.202
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.481
It has to be me.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.646
If I'm putting something like this together,

04:55.720 --> 04:57.563
a one-handed man who happens to be

04:57.640 --> 05:00.211
one of the most recognizable faces
in Westeros is not...

05:00.320 --> 05:01.970
It has to be me.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.164
You set your brother free, didn't you?

05:11.800 --> 05:13.484
I'll bet your sister didn't like that.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.482
Varys set him free.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.931
Well,

05:24.560 --> 05:28.087
if you ever see the wee fucker,
give him my regards.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.242
He murdered my father.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.924
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.129
And then I'll give him your regards.

05:49.760 --> 05:54.527
The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.171
Given the expense
of rebuilding the royal fleet...

05:57.240 --> 05:58.685
How much can the crown afford?

05:58.760 --> 06:00.125
With winter coming,

06:00.400 --> 06:03.563
half what they ask? Less?

06:03.640 --> 06:06.530
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

06:06.600 --> 06:11.162
Well, House Tyrell could front the gold,
and the crown would pay us back in time,

06:11.240 --> 06:14.289
or I'd have words with my daughter.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.561
You've already given us too much.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.843
No, we must arrange better terms
with the Iron Bank.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.331
- Absolutely.
- In person.

06:29.960 --> 06:30.961
Me?

06:31.040 --> 06:32.963
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

06:33.080 --> 06:36.641
someone of importance
to show these bankers our respect.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.690
As the king's Master of Coin,
I can think of no one more qualified.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.489
I would be honored, Your Grace.

06:41.560 --> 06:45.565
The king's expressed concern about
his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.085
He's ordered Ser Meryn
to personally lead your escort.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.640
My very own Kingsguard?
Please express my...

06:57.720 --> 06:59.165
Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.171
Of course. Of course.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.561
I'll give your regards to the
Titan of Braavos.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.204
The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.009
Not small enough.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.286
May I offer you some wine?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.650
No.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.887
The old High Septon
would have asked the vintage.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.123
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven,

07:44.200 --> 07:46.521
and should be kept pure.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.729
But the truth is, I don't like the taste.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.241
Hmm.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.241
How may I serve?

07:55.600 --> 07:59.161
All over Westeros
we hear of septs being burned,

07:59.240 --> 08:01.083
Silent Sisters raped,

08:02.560 --> 08:04.403
the bodies of holy men piled in the streets.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.562
Wars teach people to obey the sword,
not the gods.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.927
Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.610
In the days before the Targaryens,

08:13.720 --> 08:17.042
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

08:17.120 --> 08:21.682
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.162
If I explain their holy purpose
to my son, the king,

08:25.240 --> 08:29.450
I have no doubt he will sign a decree
arming the believers you felt worthy.

08:30.080 --> 08:34.005
An army that defends
the bodies and souls of the common people?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.525
An army in service to the gods themselves.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.645
And to you, of course,

08:39.320 --> 08:41.322
as the chosen representative of the Seven.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.091
An honor I never expected.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.969
Or ever wished for.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.565
Which is why you were chosen.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.444
You and I both know how the world works.

08:52.360 --> 08:56.206
Too often, the wicked are the wealthiest,
beyond the reach of justice.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.046
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.010
All sinners are equal before the gods.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.883
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

09:11.960 --> 09:14.804
Shielded by gold and privilege.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.486
May the Father judge him justly.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.170
What are you doing?

09:58.280 --> 09:59.884
Help me! Help me!

10:07.240 --> 10:09.607
Yeah. Yeah.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.211
Get off me!

10:18.520 --> 10:19.521
Come on.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.365
Shut up! Move!

10:30.720 --> 10:32.848
This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.327
Cocksuckers.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.083
Boy fucker.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.688
You buggering filth!

10:52.480 --> 10:55.882
There's a special place
in the seventh hell for your kind.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.566
Please. Please, I'll pay.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.526
I'll pay all of you.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.520
Yes, you will.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.121
Seize him.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.291
Sinner.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.727
Get your hands off me.

11:42.800 --> 11:46.168
Ser Loras of House Tyrell,
you have broken the laws of gods and men.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.007
Who do you think you are?

11:50.320 --> 11:51.481
Justice.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.881
Why is my brother in a cell?

12:00.960 --> 12:01.961
I don't know.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.204
I didn't order it.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.441
We both know who did.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.083
You told me
she was returning to Casterly Rock.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.923
Are you saying my mother's behind this?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.048
She's jealous you're not hers anymore.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.364
Arresting my brother is her revenge.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.442
Aren't you and Mother getting along?

12:27.320 --> 12:31.041
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.844
Do you have any affection for me at all?

12:37.480 --> 12:38.720
Of course I do.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.205
You're my queen.

12:41.320 --> 12:46.360
I can't bear to think of my brother
locked away in some grimy cell.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.762
I'll set him free for you.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.251
Do you promise?

12:59.440 --> 13:01.727
I demand that Ser Loras be freed now.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.446
Did I arrest him?

13:05.560 --> 13:07.050
Well, no.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.007
But you armed the Faith Militant.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.084
You gave the High Sparrow an army.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.366
I did.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.002
And your wife has every right to criticize.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.606
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother,

13:22.680 --> 13:24.523
no matter his perversions.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.801
Then,

13:29.040 --> 13:31.327
can I tell Margaery
you'll have Ser Loras released?

13:31.400 --> 13:33.880
I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.011
You're the king.

13:36.080 --> 13:40.051
I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow,
he'll release the poor boy.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.451
Halt!

14:09.920 --> 14:12.810
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.160
Give the order, and we'll
clear out this rabble.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.523
You mean kill them?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.044
Here, at the sept?

14:24.160 --> 14:26.083
You'd be sending them
to meet the gods that they love.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.170
Bastard!

14:33.240 --> 14:34.321
You're an abomination!

14:39.800 --> 14:41.564
Born of sin!

14:42.360 --> 14:43.885
Filthy bastard!

14:49.120 --> 14:50.565
We'll find another way.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.645
Abomination!

15:00.680 --> 15:02.011
My queen?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.847
There was no way
to free Ser Loras without violence.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.966
You're the King of the Andals,

15:16.040 --> 15:19.681
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector of the Realm,

15:19.760 --> 15:22.889
and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother-by-law.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.091
I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.924
Are you? When?

15:29.880 --> 15:31.211
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

15:32.200 --> 15:34.567
He was praying just now.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.405
I have to send word to Grandmother.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.250
Will you come back later?

15:44.880 --> 15:47.042
I need to be with my family, Your Grace.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.125
Of course.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.884
You think highly of this boy?

15:55.400 --> 15:56.401
Good.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.891
Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.170
And a bastard by some tavern slut.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.050
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.884
I should have given you a son.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.365
Not your fault.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.885
Whose, then?

16:15.640 --> 16:17.961
I gave you nothing but weakness

16:21.160 --> 16:22.161
and deformity.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.325
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.890
My lady.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.086
Her father is the Lord's chosen king,

16:31.160 --> 16:33.686
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.162
You march on Winterfell soon?

16:45.240 --> 16:48.528
We must to beat the snows.

16:49.760 --> 16:54.288
Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos
and left me behind.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.848
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.126
I won't.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.760
I need you.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.241
You only need faith, my king.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.609
And you. What do you need?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.369
To serve my Lord.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.724
Lord Ashford.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.609
Lady Caulfield.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.925
Lord Smallwood.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.051
I've never even heard of these people.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.003
They haven't heard of you, either.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.047
But we need men, and they have some.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.410
How many men does this Lord Mayzen
have to send us?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.887
More than Lord Wibberley.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.521
- Not him.
- I know. I'm sorry.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.250
But we need men and supplies,

18:08.960 --> 18:10.450
and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.646
He murdered my brother.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.530
We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.009
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.606
And we can't get more men
without help from the Warden of the North.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.724
Apologies, my lady.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.410
Lord Commander.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.203
How can I help you?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.362
Come with us when we ride south.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.410
None of us know the castle
as well as you do.

19:09.480 --> 19:13.087
Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses,
its people.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.841
Winterfell was your home once.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.800
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

19:23.520 --> 19:26.046
Castle Black is my home now.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.569
The Night's Watch take no part
in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.085
There's only one war.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.684
Life against death.

19:35.760 --> 19:39.003
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.082
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

19:42.080 --> 19:45.448
Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.121
No visions. No magic.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.766
Just life.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.447
Do you feel my heart beating?

20:17.120 --> 20:19.009
There's power in you.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.927
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.890
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.081
Two parts of a greater whole.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.731
In our joining, there's power.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.640
Power to make life,

20:47.720 --> 20:50.246
power to make light,

20:50.320 --> 20:52.322
and power to cast shadows.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.050
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.525
Then we shouldn't tell him.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.761
- I can't.
- Why?

21:03.680 --> 21:04.681
I swore a vow.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.410
I loved another.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.167
The dead don't need lovers.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.361
Only the living.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.280
I know.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.411
But I still love her.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.609
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.487
Are you lonely?

22:21.440 --> 22:22.521
Just bored.

22:22.600 --> 22:26.002
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.766
Were you bored a lot, too?

22:29.080 --> 22:31.890
I know Castle Black
is no place for a child, but...

22:31.960 --> 22:34.611
I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.443
I know Mother didn't want to bring me.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.720
Why do you say that?

22:41.920 --> 22:43.729
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

22:45.840 --> 22:47.285
She shouldn't have said that.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.289
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

23:10.960 --> 23:12.166
When you were an infant,

23:13.600 --> 23:16.171
a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.323
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

23:21.800 --> 23:25.122
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

23:27.080 --> 23:32.849
No doubt he'd heard of your birth
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.323
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that doll in your cradle.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.803
How you pressed it to your cheek.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.647
By the time we burned the doll,
it was too late.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.649
I was told you would die.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.811
Or worse,

24:01.080 --> 24:02.809
the greyscale would go slow.

24:03.560 --> 24:08.043
Let you grow just enough to know the world
before taking it away from you.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.691
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of Valyria

24:10.800 --> 24:12.962
to live out your short
life with the stone men,

24:13.040 --> 24:15.884
before the sickness
spread through the castle.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.449
I told them all to go to hell.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.450
I called in every maester
on this side of the world.

24:24.520 --> 24:27.569
Every healer. Every apothecary.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.767
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.364
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody stone men.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.401
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.044
And you are my daughter.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.801
I thought I might find you here.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.290
Your Aunt Lyanna.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.243
Father never talked about her,

25:57.760 --> 26:00.604
but sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.845
They say she was beautiful.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.205
I saw her once.

26:06.280 --> 26:09.443
I was a boy living with
your mother's family.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.490
Lord Whent held a great tourney
at Harrenhal.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.324
Everyone was there.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.529
The Mad King, your father,

26:18.600 --> 26:20.204
Robert Baratheon,

26:21.040 --> 26:22.326
and Lyanna.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.641
She was already promised to Robert.

26:25.400 --> 26:30.531
You can imagine what it was like for me,
a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,

26:30.600 --> 26:34.207
watching these legendary men
tilting at the lists.

26:35.440 --> 26:40.082
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.841
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.843
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet,

26:45.920 --> 26:48.127
and they saw that silver hair.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.361
How handsome he was.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.285
Until he rode right past his wife,

26:53.480 --> 26:57.121
Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.727
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.924
He rode past his wife,

27:05.640 --> 27:09.281
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.885
Blue as frost.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.891
How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

27:21.560 --> 27:23.562
Yes, he chose her.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.801
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.491
Come.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.651
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.126
You're dressed for riding.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.201
I am.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.724
Where are you going?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.848
King's Landing.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.490
King's Landing?

27:54.560 --> 27:56.642
Cersei sent for me.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.087
We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.

27:59.480 --> 28:00.970
You can't leave me here.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.282
I know how hard it is
to live with people you despise.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.407
Believe me.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.406
But it won't be for long.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.327
How do you know?

28:10.160 --> 28:13.369
Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.

28:13.800 --> 28:17.566
He'll march south to King's Landing
before the winter snows block his way.

28:17.640 --> 28:21.042
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.441
- You don't know that.
- I do.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.522
Once he liberates these lands
from the Boltons,

28:26.640 --> 28:29.120
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

28:29.200 --> 28:33.728
With the North behind him,
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.723
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

28:36.680 --> 28:38.170
He has a larger army.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.891
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.726
A betting man would
put his money on Stannis.

28:44.800 --> 28:47.246
I am a betting man.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.209
And if you're right?

28:50.280 --> 28:52.282
Stannis takes Winterfell,

28:52.360 --> 28:55.489
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the North.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.530
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

28:58.600 --> 29:01.046
he names you Wardeness of the North.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.445
But I...

29:03.520 --> 29:05.204
I wouldn't...

29:05.280 --> 29:06.691
Wardeness of the North?

29:06.760 --> 29:08.967
You are the last surviving Stark.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.441
He needs you.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.370
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?

29:14.480 --> 29:17.131
Or he does, and the Boltons defeat him?

29:17.200 --> 29:20.727
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
and make him yours.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.931
I don't know how to do that.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.764
Of course you do.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.604
He's already fallen for you.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.770
His father frightens me.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.410
He should. He's a dangerous man.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.523
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmaneuvered.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.487
And you've learned to maneuver
from the very best.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.441
I'll return before too long.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.329
You be strong without me.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.202
The North will be yours.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.925
Do you believe me?

30:01.720 --> 30:05.088
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.001
Breakfast.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.124
That would have been a shit way to die.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.569
As far as I've seen,
they're all shit ways to die.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.723
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.644
I don't care
what's sung about me when I'm dead.

31:25.720 --> 31:26.960
No?

31:27.560 --> 31:32.043
Two knights off to rescue a princess.
Sounds like a good song to me.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.525
Sounds like all the rest.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.323
What about you?

31:39.400 --> 31:41.641
What shit way would you choose?

31:42.800 --> 31:48.045
In my own keep, drinking my own wine,
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.761
How disappointing.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.810
I thought you'd have
something more exciting planned.

31:55.320 --> 31:59.166
I've had an exciting life.
I want my death to be boring.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.764
How do you want to go?

32:02.840 --> 32:05.241
In the arms of the woman I love.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.001
She want the same thing?

32:16.240 --> 32:17.685
Let's go.

32:27.920 --> 32:31.242
The captain of that ship,
what was he, Braavosi?

32:31.320 --> 32:33.049
Pentoshi.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.690
And he's headed to Oldtown?

32:34.760 --> 32:36.728
As I said. Why?

32:37.400 --> 32:39.448
What's to stop him
from docking down the coast,

32:39.560 --> 32:42.166
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dome?

32:42.240 --> 32:43.730
A bag of gold.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.050
I'm not sure you understand

32:46.120 --> 32:48.691
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.603
It was a heavy bag.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.490
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.688
But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.602
- How many you count?
- Four.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.844
How many do you think you can take?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.922
One, if he's slow.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.170
Halt!

33:17.880 --> 33:19.325
Over the hill.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.528
Fucked in the ass.

33:27.960 --> 33:28.961
Hyah!

33:33.360 --> 33:34.361
Morning, lads.

33:35.600 --> 33:36.647
Glad we found you.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.121
Who are you?

33:39.920 --> 33:42.969
Cooper. This is Darnell.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.690
You're from King's Landing.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.489
Accent gave me away?

33:47.960 --> 33:50.361
Flea Bottom, whelped and whipped.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.487
Why are you here?

33:51.840 --> 33:55.128
Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.122
It was a near thing, really.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.402
Thought the sharks would get us.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.362
There are no sharks in Dorne.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.281
Could have sworn those were shark fins.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.091
Dolphins, maybe.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.165
Throw your swords in the sand.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.960
Boys, there's no need for this.

34:16.040 --> 34:20.125
Just point us in the right direction,
we'll find our way home.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.368
Swords in the sand now.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.887
Hyah! Hyah!

34:50.560 --> 34:52.210
That one should be slow enough.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.684
Nice move.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.851
Luck.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.562
You had a wonderful teacher.

36:07.080 --> 36:10.163
Always wanted a Dornish stallion.

36:10.240 --> 36:13.847
Beasts can run a day and
night without tiring.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.003
We'll ride to the Water Gardens
with a nice breeze in our faces.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.570
First we need to bury these bodies.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.131
Birds have to eat, too.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.527
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.489
We're not here to start a war.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.931
Do you know how long it'll take us
to dig all those holes?

36:29.440 --> 36:32.364
I can't dig very well with one hand.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.408
Not at all, really.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.966
Mama.

37:12.640 --> 37:13.880
Nym, Obara.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.968
Will it be war?

37:16.040 --> 37:18.566
Prince Doran will weep for your father,
but nothing else.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.120
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.329
Without Doran, we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.163
We don't need an army to start a war.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.845
Queen Cersei loves her children,

37:31.680 --> 37:32.841
and we have one of them.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.724
You may have a problem.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.283
A ship's captain
who found me in Planky Town

37:43.360 --> 37:45.044
claiming he had information to sell.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.929
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.444
He's come for Myrcella.

37:53.520 --> 37:58.128
If he gets to her before we do,
we lose our only chance for revenge.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.050
You must choose.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.449
Doran's way and peace,

38:03.520 --> 38:06.330
or my way and war.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.202
I'm with you always.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.565
Nym?

38:17.960 --> 38:19.291
Obara?

38:20.600 --> 38:24.321
When I was a child,
Oberyn came to take me to court.

38:24.400 --> 38:28.291
I had never seen this man,
and yet he called himself my father.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.965
My mother wept, said I was too young
and a girl.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.604
Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said,

38:38.680 --> 38:41.524
"Girl or boy, we fight our battles,

38:41.600 --> 38:44.729
"but the gods let us choose our weapons."

38:45.080 --> 38:49.404
My father pointed to the spear,
and then to my mother's tears.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.447
I made my choice long ago.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.724
Will you untie me?

39:05.080 --> 39:07.924
Will you please untie me?

39:08.640 --> 39:09.926
Will you please?

39:33.320 --> 39:34.606
Thank you.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.881
Who are you?

39:44.960 --> 39:45.961
Your captor.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.251
Do you have wine?

39:50.320 --> 39:51.560
No.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.045
Can't sleep without wine.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.651
Then stay awake.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.810
You're going the wrong way.

40:05.120 --> 40:10.160
My sister is in Westeros. Westeros is west.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.964
We're heading east.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.247
I'm not taking you to your sister.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.081
You said you were taking me to the queen.

40:18.160 --> 40:22.927
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
She's the queen I serve.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.525
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.009
It so happens I was heading there myself.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.842
What business would you have
with the queen?

40:37.920 --> 40:40.400
Gold and glory. Oh, and hate.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.206
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.568
So now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

40:58.880 --> 41:04.364
A highborn knight from the north of Westeros
down on his luck in Essos.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.723
Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.484
You're Jorah Mormont.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.689
I have to ask.

41:14.760 --> 41:19.288
How exactly were you serving your queen
in a whorehouse half a world away?

41:19.920 --> 41:22.321
Is it possible that you were running?

41:23.400 --> 41:27.121
Why would you be running?
And why would she have sent you away?

41:28.160 --> 41:29.207
Oh, wait.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.921
You were spying on her, weren't you?

41:34.040 --> 41:35.690
It's all coming back to me.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.728
I was drunk through
most of the Small Council meetings,

41:37.800 --> 41:39.529
but it's all coming back.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.769
You passed notes to Varys' little birds.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.960
She found out, didn't she?

41:47.040 --> 41:49.281
Found out and exiled you.

41:50.440 --> 41:53.683
Now you hope to
win back her favor with a gift.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.611
Risky scheme.

41:57.520 --> 42:00.000
One might even say desperate.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.849
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

42:06.280 --> 42:08.760
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

42:30.360 --> 42:33.125
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.650
What?

42:36.680 --> 42:38.728
I was thinking about all
the times your brother

42:38.800 --> 42:42.247
made me go with him down from the Red Keep
into the streets of King's Landing.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.164
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.810
He liked to sing to them.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.767
He sang to them?

42:48.840 --> 42:50.524
Yes.

42:51.160 --> 42:56.530
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook,
or the Street of Seeds, and then he'd sing.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.931
Just like all the other minstrels.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.161
And what did you do?

42:59.480 --> 43:01.005
I made sure no one killed him.

43:01.560 --> 43:04.325
And I collected the money.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.402
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.488
- He was good?
- He was very good.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.800
Viserys never told you?

43:09.880 --> 43:12.406
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.285
Rhaegar never liked killing.
He loved singing.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.331
And what did you do with the money?

43:18.400 --> 43:21.688
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

43:21.760 --> 43:24.240
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

43:24.520 --> 43:28.047
One time, we got horribly drunk.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.567
Your Grace.

43:32.320 --> 43:35.688
Hizdahr is here,
waiting in the audience chamber.

43:36.560 --> 43:37.607
How many others are there?

43:38.360 --> 43:39.805
Fifty? 100?

43:40.880 --> 43:42.564
Will you be joining us?

43:42.680 --> 43:46.366
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

43:46.440 --> 43:48.886
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

43:50.160 --> 43:53.050
Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.404
Your Grace.

44:00.400 --> 44:03.802
All men must die,
but not all can die in glory.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.928
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

44:06.240 --> 44:09.722
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

44:09.880 --> 44:12.326
So their names would live on.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.244
Those who find victory in the fighting pits
will never become kings,

44:15.320 --> 44:17.368
but their names will live on.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.283
It's the best chance they'll ever have.

44:19.360 --> 44:20.850
Is that what you used to tell men

44:20.920 --> 44:23.810
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

44:23.880 --> 44:26.690
Today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.489
I do not recognize this tradition.

44:28.600 --> 44:31.683
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

44:31.760 --> 44:33.205
your city, together.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.808
Without them, former slaves and
former masters have nothing in common.

44:40.680 --> 44:44.082
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

44:45.400 --> 44:48.802
I can't promise
this is the answer to all our problems,

44:49.280 --> 44:50.930
but it's a start.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.404
Sons of the Harpy.
