WEBVTT

00:00.269 --> 00:01.553
Man:1 <i>All right, ten hours down</i>

00:01.600 --> 00:03.789
<i>and only three more to go.
I got this.</i>

00:03.866 --> 00:06.189
Man 2: <i>Seriously, just pull over
and get some sleep.</i>

00:06.263 --> 00:07.398
<i>This is crazy.</i>

00:07.485 --> 00:08.835
You want to know what's crazy?

00:08.892 --> 00:10.578
Letting Betty move to New York.

00:10.664 --> 00:12.024
Not stopping the woman I love

00:12.056 --> 00:13.814
from making the biggest
mistake of her life.

00:13.853 --> 00:16.757
<i>It actually sounds like Betty's
doing extremely well out there.</i>

00:16.840 --> 00:18.843
<i>I mean, it's been
four years, Gordy.</i>

00:18.968 --> 00:21.343
Yeah, four years I couldn't stop
thinking about her.

00:21.432 --> 00:23.851
<i>Dude, you and Betty
dated for, like, a month.</i>

00:24.001 --> 00:25.250
<i>If you show up on her doorstep,</i>

00:25.298 --> 00:27.156
<i>trust me,
you're gonna look insane.</i>

00:27.304 --> 00:29.125
Ah, you want to know
what's insane?

00:29.206 --> 00:31.445
Letting Betty go to New York.
That's insane.

00:31.508 --> 00:33.546
<i>Gordy, enough. You need sleep.</i>

00:33.629 --> 00:35.343
<i>You're starting to sound
like a lunatic.</i>

00:35.446 --> 00:37.670
Nah, that's just the sound
of love, my friend.

00:37.718 --> 00:39.184
<i>The sweet, sweet sound of...</i>

00:39.216 --> 00:41.516
oh! Oh, God!
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

00:41.552 --> 00:42.652
<i>What's going on?</i>
Oh, my God!

00:42.686 --> 00:44.056
<i>Gordy, what's going on?</i>

00:44.088 --> 00:45.866
(yells)
<i>is everything all right?</i>

00:45.952 --> 00:47.082
It just fell from the sky

00:47.191 --> 00:48.921
like some damn bird
or something!

00:48.959 --> 00:50.219
<i>Gordy? Gordy?</i>

00:52.930 --> 00:55.360
<i>Gordy? Gordy!</i>

00:58.402 --> 01:01.702
<i>Gordy?!</i>

01:02.111 --> 01:03.729
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

01:03.777 --> 01:05.236
<i>And do not tell me
that was the sound of love.</i>

01:05.284 --> 01:06.838
That was the sound of death.

01:09.658 --> 01:11.879
Tell mama I just
crashed her car.

01:13.580 --> 01:14.776
Oh...

01:15.603 --> 01:18.073
Oh!

01:21.125 --> 01:24.795
Brennan: The victim jumped
30 feet off an overpass

01:25.000 --> 01:27.398
and landed on a passing car.

01:27.464 --> 01:28.794
Booth: That's
gonna leave a dent.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.359
I imagine it would
and given the, uh,

01:31.407 --> 01:33.819
gravitational acceleration rate
of 9.8 meters per...

01:33.867 --> 01:35.164
Ah, come on, Bones.
It's too early for math.

01:35.211 --> 01:36.969
Too early.
It's never too early for math.

01:37.017 --> 01:38.461
Anything before
12:00 is too early,

01:38.515 --> 01:39.665
anything after
12:00 is too late.

01:39.712 --> 01:40.877
That leaves no time for math.

01:40.911 --> 01:42.441
I don't want math.
I want math.

01:42.479 --> 01:43.909
It's way too early.

01:43.947 --> 01:45.887
Hey, take a look there,
that's Dr. Mayer, right?

01:45.916 --> 01:47.616
Brennan:
Oh, Dr. Mayer!

01:47.719 --> 01:49.336
It's so nice to see you again.

01:49.430 --> 01:50.555
Oh, Dr. Brennan!

01:50.621 --> 01:52.321
Agent Booth.

01:52.422 --> 01:54.875
What a treat. Please, join me.

01:54.951 --> 01:57.062
Uh, well, we-we got some food
to go, so...

01:57.154 --> 01:59.124
I got to get Boneshere
back to the lab.

01:59.196 --> 02:00.445
You're wearing your
jeffersonian lanyard.

02:00.492 --> 02:01.564
Are you coming in

02:01.612 --> 02:03.109
to help I.D.
The jumper?

02:03.185 --> 02:05.955
Actually,
I've hung up my lab coat.

02:06.072 --> 02:08.719
I never thought of you
as one to retire.

02:08.806 --> 02:10.203
Oh, heavens no.

02:10.274 --> 02:12.226
I woke up one morning and...

02:12.309 --> 02:14.649
Just found
the passion was missing.

02:15.858 --> 02:17.264
Well,
if you're not working anymore,

02:17.327 --> 02:19.032
why are you wearing
your jeffersonian badge?

02:19.079 --> 02:22.108
I'm studying prairie dogs
with the zoology department.

02:22.207 --> 02:23.600
Prairie dogs?

02:23.683 --> 02:26.686
Oh, actually, they're
fascinating little creatures.

02:26.944 --> 02:30.296
Did you know
their entire mating window

02:30.447 --> 02:33.249
is one hour a year?
(chuckles)

02:33.383 --> 02:35.804
by "fascinating,"
you mean "sad," right?

02:35.875 --> 02:37.139
(laughs)

02:37.234 --> 02:40.163
uh, congratulations
on your new career path.

02:40.270 --> 02:42.186
You seem... You seem happy.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.232
Sometimes it just takes
a new match

02:44.274 --> 02:46.358
to get the old flame
burning again.

02:46.478 --> 02:49.100
(laughs) tell that
to the prairie dogs, huh?

02:49.148 --> 02:50.319
(Mayer laughs)

02:50.415 --> 02:52.264
okay, got to go.
Let's go, Bones.

02:52.319 --> 02:54.397
Bye.
Thank you, Doll.

02:54.889 --> 02:57.115
Hodgins: Ooh, okay,
how about "Hulk Bones:

02:57.154 --> 02:59.124
"A study on the skeletal effects

02:59.156 --> 03:00.926
of incredible physical
strength."

03:00.957 --> 03:02.172
that's a great idea, Hodgins.

03:02.220 --> 03:03.570
Unfortunately,
to write that paper,

03:03.617 --> 03:04.820
I would need hulk's Bones.

03:04.868 --> 03:06.792
And since the Hulk
doesn't actually exist...

03:06.900 --> 03:08.547
Trust me,
your dissertation committee,

03:08.598 --> 03:09.922
they're gonna eat it up.
It's gonna prove

03:09.954 --> 03:11.898
that you can think
outside the box. Or,

03:11.970 --> 03:13.477
that you've completely
lost your mind.

03:13.599 --> 03:15.017
Brennan: Mr. Bray,
please catch me up

03:15.064 --> 03:16.894
on what you've discovered
thus far.

03:17.140 --> 03:19.273
Based on the size
of the femoral head

03:19.343 --> 03:21.398
coupled with the strong
torsion of the femoral neck,

03:21.478 --> 03:23.234
the victim was a Caucasian male.

03:23.313 --> 03:24.578
Brennan: Well,
excellent work,

03:24.641 --> 03:26.352
given the condition
of the remains.

03:26.483 --> 03:28.258
Burnt, broken,
and cut to ribbons.

03:28.306 --> 03:29.313
Well, if he wanted
to kill himself,

03:29.360 --> 03:31.164
he certainly
accomplished his goal.

03:31.409 --> 03:33.391
Our victim did not want
to kill himself.

03:33.502 --> 03:35.180
Well, according to
the police report,

03:35.228 --> 03:36.578
he jumped off an overpass.

03:36.727 --> 03:39.055
The fractures on the
skull are dry breaks.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.067
Which means he was actually dead
before he fall.

03:41.148 --> 03:42.500
This was a murder

03:42.585 --> 03:44.914
made to look like a suicide.

What is it that excites you

04:52.285 --> 04:54.794
I don't know. Uh,
lots of things.

04:54.872 --> 04:56.770
Your dissertation on
the effects of tribalism

04:56.833 --> 04:58.029
within ancient karakorum

04:58.091 --> 04:59.778
was certainly an early
inspiration for me.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.278
Oh, as it should have been.
It's an exceptional paper,

05:02.326 --> 05:03.826
as are the other four
I've written.

05:03.935 --> 05:05.810
You wrote five dissertations?

05:05.973 --> 05:08.162
I was curious about
a variety of topics

05:08.240 --> 05:11.247
and I couldn't decide which one
to focus my attention on, so,

05:11.350 --> 05:12.920
I just wrote all five.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.224
Wa... (chuckles) wasn't
that a lot of work?

05:15.349 --> 05:18.724
Yes, Mr. Bray.
That was the point.

05:21.094 --> 05:22.685
Uh, it's tough to be certain,

05:22.734 --> 05:24.943
given the condition of the
skull, but there seems to be

05:25.029 --> 05:27.327
evidence of frontal bossing.

05:27.755 --> 05:29.841
Hmm. Aside from
the tobacco staining,

05:29.935 --> 05:32.833
did you discover
anything unusual

05:32.888 --> 05:33.943
about the victim's teeth?

05:34.053 --> 05:36.693
He had a few crowns,
but that's about it.

05:36.935 --> 05:39.462
I would like to
remove one of those crowns.

05:42.294 --> 05:45.134
(squishing, cracking)

05:45.607 --> 05:47.263
bray:
A baby tooth.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.552
As I suspected.

05:49.775 --> 05:52.193
Evidence of enamel hypoplasia.

05:52.241 --> 05:53.271
It appears

05:53.319 --> 05:55.224
the victim suffered
from malignant

05:55.308 --> 05:58.146
infantile osteopetrosis
as a child.

05:58.276 --> 05:59.943
That's a pretty rare disease.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.630
Which means it may be able
to provide us with an I.D.

06:03.794 --> 06:05.482
Booth:
Ooh.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.607
Hey, uh, I checked with
the local hospitals,

06:07.735 --> 06:10.326
found a patient matching
our victim's description.

06:11.289 --> 06:12.419
Ooh.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.435
Uh, victim's name
is Ronald Bergman,

06:14.525 --> 06:15.795
but you may know him better as

06:15.873 --> 06:18.343
the mattress king
of southeast Baltimore.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.294
This sounds like a good
case for James Aubrey,

06:20.342 --> 06:23.685
the murder solving king
of Washington D.C.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.255
What? Hold on a second. Ah.

06:26.345 --> 06:27.556
Are you giving me lead on this?

06:27.603 --> 06:28.623
You know what, Aubrey,
if you want to

06:28.670 --> 06:30.326
be a supervisory special agent,

06:30.374 --> 06:32.982
you got to get a little ASA
experience under your belt.

06:33.054 --> 06:34.966
Wow, thank you, Booth.

06:36.389 --> 06:38.990
So does this mean that,
like, I'm your boss now?

06:39.038 --> 06:41.396
Listen, Aubrey,
if you have to ask

06:41.474 --> 06:43.396
if you're my boss,
you're not my boss.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.614
Okay.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.037
Look at that.

06:46.321 --> 06:48.181
Oh! Double tap-in.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.115
Ron: <i>Whether it's

06:51.225 --> 06:54.170
<i>taking a stroll on Mars or...</i>

06:54.288 --> 06:56.295
<i>Just catching some ZS,</i>

06:56.459 --> 06:58.092
<i>here at snoozeland,</i>

06:58.187 --> 07:00.287
<i>we'll help you
achieve your dreams!</i>

07:00.399 --> 07:02.545
That guy seems so sweet.

07:03.145 --> 07:05.858
It's obvious he really cared
about what he was doing.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.210
I've never seen you
get so emotional

07:08.242 --> 07:09.872
over a commercial before.

07:09.990 --> 07:12.154
Well, in this age of snark,

07:12.213 --> 07:13.843
I'm just thankful for someone

07:13.912 --> 07:16.014
with some good
old-fashioned sincerity.

07:16.209 --> 07:18.553
Then I'll save the snark
and get right to the point.

07:18.586 --> 07:19.951
Angela, I have a job for you.

07:19.999 --> 07:22.772
Apparently, one that reeks
of burnt human hair.

07:22.861 --> 07:23.998
Thigh hair, in fact.

07:24.046 --> 07:25.998
The victim's cell phone
melted to his leg

07:26.053 --> 07:27.451
- during the fire.
- All right,

07:27.499 --> 07:30.420
so do you think there's
enough left to pull the data?

07:30.498 --> 07:31.943
Wow, this thing
is really cooked,

07:32.014 --> 07:34.233
but I'll give it a shot.
Okay.

07:36.270 --> 07:38.040
Aubrey:
<i>So, Ms. Martin,</i>

07:38.108 --> 07:41.112
now, uh, you are the manager
of snoozeland, is that correct?

07:41.186 --> 07:43.514
I am. And we're actually
pretty busy right now,

07:43.562 --> 07:45.434
so the sooner we can
get this over with, the better.

07:45.481 --> 07:46.583
Okay.

07:46.631 --> 07:48.608
Sensing some annoyance.

07:48.656 --> 07:50.731
- That would be because I'm annoyed.
- Oh.

07:50.779 --> 07:52.106
We're in the middle
of a giant sale

07:52.153 --> 07:53.783
and I don't have time...

07:53.912 --> 07:55.967
(groans)
what is it?

07:56.022 --> 07:57.701
What did my idiot ex
do this time?

07:57.787 --> 07:58.897
What? No.

07:58.967 --> 08:00.787
Uh, this is about your boss.

08:00.865 --> 08:02.108
He was found dead this morning.

08:02.196 --> 08:03.596
Ronny?
Yeah.

08:03.662 --> 08:06.461
And we have reason to
believe that it was murder.

08:06.623 --> 08:08.571
I knew this was a mistake.

08:08.740 --> 08:10.225
What was a mistake?

08:10.395 --> 08:13.395
Ronny is a... Creative guy,

08:13.541 --> 08:15.647
full of all these wild ideas.

08:15.710 --> 08:18.610
And after directing
all the snoozeland commercials,

08:18.646 --> 08:21.616
he decided he was ready
for the real thing.

08:21.857 --> 08:22.941
A real commercial?

08:23.045 --> 08:24.217
Movie.

08:24.299 --> 08:27.350
Said he was gonna be
the next Gordon welles.

08:28.568 --> 08:29.842
Orson welles?

08:30.275 --> 08:33.365
Sure. Whatever, I don't know
about any of that stuff.

08:33.490 --> 08:34.490
All I know is

08:34.544 --> 08:37.248
Ronny wrote himself a story,
took a leave of absence

08:37.308 --> 08:38.958
from work and went off

08:39.037 --> 08:40.832
- to make his movie.
- Huh.

08:40.897 --> 08:43.601
This movie was
all Ronny could think about.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.038
It was going to be
his <i> citizen crane.</i>

08:46.159 --> 08:47.159
(file closes)

08:54.083 --> 08:55.650
- so I've been going through... blobs whoa!
- Ohh! Aah!

08:55.697 --> 08:56.954
That used to be
our victim's shoes.

08:57.001 --> 08:58.271
Geez, Hodgins.

08:58.319 --> 09:00.319
You cannot just roll up on me
like that.

09:00.436 --> 09:01.763
I'm in a wheelchair, Cam.

09:01.811 --> 09:03.865
I have no choice,
but to roll up on you.

09:03.959 --> 09:05.191
Fair enough.

09:05.226 --> 09:07.226
So, so far, the only
thing I've found

09:07.261 --> 09:08.529
in the victim's shoe treads

09:08.654 --> 09:09.842
are a piece of cigarette butt

09:09.890 --> 09:12.475
and some small
white marble chips.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.764
Like the kind used
in decorative landscaping?

09:14.861 --> 09:16.585
He had to have been walking
around in this stuff

09:16.632 --> 09:18.756
shortly before he died.
The only problem is

09:18.804 --> 09:20.881
white marble chips,
they're not rare enough

09:20.951 --> 09:22.162
to tell us where that was.

09:22.210 --> 09:25.115
Yeah, well, wherever he was,
he was in a struggle.

09:25.389 --> 09:27.764
Looks like there are
two incisions

09:27.852 --> 09:29.858
- on his right forearm.
- Well, yeah,

09:29.975 --> 09:31.747
the guy did fall
through a windshield.

09:31.786 --> 09:33.826
But there's no trace
of glass in these incisions.

09:33.855 --> 09:35.925
They appear to be
defensive wounds.

09:36.248 --> 09:37.817
Unfortunately,

09:37.936 --> 09:39.537
the tissue is too badly
compromised

09:39.678 --> 09:40.967
to get a better description.

09:41.062 --> 09:43.392
All right, well, let me swab,
I'll see what I can find.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.858
Come to poppa, you nasty
little piece of flesh.

09:47.090 --> 09:49.460
This is a fairly
decent operation.

09:49.604 --> 09:51.444
I mean, it's no <i> bone of</i>
<i>contention</i> or anything.

09:51.553 --> 09:53.420
The one thing I learned
about these guys,

09:53.476 --> 09:55.066
these creative types,

09:55.209 --> 09:56.769
they're definitely
a breed of their own.

09:56.858 --> 09:58.554
You know, I heard the guy
who played agent Andy

09:58.601 --> 09:59.365
is in rehab now.

09:59.413 --> 10:01.123
Hey, stop with the
<i>tmz,</i> just focus.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.818
Man:
And action!

10:02.920 --> 10:04.750
Okay, I thought our director
was supposed to be dead?

10:04.786 --> 10:06.529
Well, lead, Aubrey, lead.

10:06.597 --> 10:07.937
(women screaming)

10:08.122 --> 10:11.362
(creatures growling)

10:11.392 --> 10:13.722
(screaming)

10:13.886 --> 10:17.769
Aubrey: Oh, dear God, this is
like spring break on bath salts.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.136
Woman:
Oh! Oh, no!

10:19.234 --> 10:20.304
Booth:
Excuse me?

10:21.245 --> 10:22.511
FBI.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.066
Who's the director here?

10:24.237 --> 10:25.968
Uh, I think his name is Kirby

10:26.007 --> 10:28.107
or herby or something.
I'm not sure.

10:28.214 --> 10:30.372
Yesterday, dude was
just the sandwich boy.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.331
Booth: Yeah and now
he's directing this.

10:32.379 --> 10:33.980
Whatever this is.
<i>Be careful with those guts!</i>

10:34.027 --> 10:34.908
<i>They're rentals.</i>

10:34.949 --> 10:35.909
(woman screams)

10:35.950 --> 10:37.580
- <i>look out!</i>
- What...?

10:37.618 --> 10:40.118
I'm gonna eat you!

10:41.487 --> 10:43.511
(indistinct chatter)

10:43.785 --> 10:45.823
I'm sorry, but what
is this movie supposed to be?

10:45.879 --> 10:48.058
(chuckles)
<i>Radioactive Party Panthers</i>

10:48.136 --> 10:49.394
<i>from Fort Lauderdale.</i>

10:49.450 --> 10:50.957
Thought you guys were supposed
to know this stuff.

10:51.004 --> 10:52.933
We know enough, Kirby.
Enough to be talking to you.

10:52.980 --> 10:54.072
I like the sound of that.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.566
And I'm sorry.
You guys are with FBI?

10:56.636 --> 10:58.761
I haven't heard of them.
Are they new?

10:58.831 --> 11:02.402
You haven't heard of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.807
Oh, that FBI.
(laughs)

11:04.855 --> 11:07.081
Bummer. I thought you guys
were, like, Hollywood Agents.

11:07.129 --> 11:08.175
Real Agents.

11:08.223 --> 11:10.353
We are real Agents.
Investigating a real murder.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.472
So why don't you tell us
why the sandwich boy

11:12.520 --> 11:14.890
is suddenly directing
a dead man's movie.

11:15.691 --> 11:17.050
Ron is dead?

11:17.139 --> 11:19.649
- Yeah.
- Friggin' a.

11:19.933 --> 11:21.504
I guess that explains
why I couldn't get ahold of him

11:21.551 --> 11:22.824
- this morning.
- Sorry, so you thought,

11:22.871 --> 11:24.520
because you knew how
to make a cheese sandwich,

11:24.567 --> 11:25.797
you could direct his movie?

11:25.887 --> 11:27.357
Okay, I went to film school.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.016
I know how story works.

11:29.092 --> 11:30.456
I know why I'm a suspect.

11:30.551 --> 11:33.534
But trust me, I didn't kill Ron
to take control of his movie.

11:33.666 --> 11:34.846
Why should we believe you?

11:34.894 --> 11:36.735
'cause he was already
giving me plenty of control.

11:36.782 --> 11:38.252
When was the last time
you saw Ron?

11:38.307 --> 11:39.706
(sighs)
last night.

11:39.754 --> 11:41.300
We finished shooting
at the hot tub warehouse

11:41.347 --> 11:42.987
around 10:00,
and everyone went home.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.705
Did you notice
anything strange about him?

11:44.753 --> 11:47.081
Acting weird?
Anything out of the ordinary?

11:47.129 --> 11:48.699
Nope. It was just
your normal day shooting

11:48.746 --> 11:50.792
a Radioactive Panther attack
in a hot tub store.

11:50.858 --> 11:53.737
So, how many Cameras
did Ron usually have rolling?

11:53.864 --> 11:55.097
As many as he could get.

11:55.255 --> 11:57.885
Ron was the type of director
that shot everything.

11:58.049 --> 11:59.819
Oh, great.

12:00.226 --> 12:02.153
Listen, we're gonna need
to get ahold of that footage.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.956
Sure. Yeah. I can also give you
some of the stuff I shot today.

12:05.075 --> 12:07.878
I got this great shot
of a disembodied arm's P.O.V.

12:07.933 --> 12:10.163
No. We're good. Thank you, bye.

12:15.097 --> 12:16.948
Bray:
Killer klowns from outer space?

12:17.076 --> 12:19.616
<i>Aaah! Zombies!!?</i> Come on, you
had to have heard of <i> sharknado.</i>

12:19.664 --> 12:21.808
Those are all
scientifically implausible.

12:21.878 --> 12:23.692
Oh, completely. But I think
that's part of the appeal

12:23.739 --> 12:26.369
of B movies... they offer
a mindless escape.

12:26.457 --> 12:27.957
So people enjoy these movies

12:28.029 --> 12:30.464
because they don't
require them to think?

12:30.608 --> 12:32.784
After a long day at work,
don't you ever just want

12:32.857 --> 12:33.886
to go home and turn it off?

12:33.933 --> 12:36.193
No. I enjoy using my mind,

12:36.263 --> 12:38.654
and so should you.

12:38.863 --> 12:40.646
Have you made any progress

12:40.744 --> 12:43.314
in determining a topic
for your dissertation?

12:43.394 --> 12:44.974
I've got nothing.

12:45.121 --> 12:46.435
Perhaps reading

12:46.529 --> 12:48.380
my unpublished dissertations

12:48.530 --> 12:51.490
might... inspire something in you.

12:51.557 --> 12:53.333
That would be awesome.
Thank you.

12:53.499 --> 12:58.224
There appears to be severe
perimortem blunt force trauma

12:58.352 --> 13:00.388
on the Sacrum, T8 and T9,

13:00.436 --> 13:02.974
and the right scapula.

13:03.403 --> 13:05.130
Bray: Judging
by the indistinct wound edges,

13:05.178 --> 13:06.810
and heavy amount
of fracture lines,

13:06.842 --> 13:10.325
the weapon used to create
this damage had a round outline.

13:10.388 --> 13:12.779
Maybe a pipe, or a baseball bat?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.646
Until the skull's reconstructed,

13:14.694 --> 13:17.560
there's no telling if this
beating was cause of death.

13:17.646 --> 13:19.646
(whirring)

13:19.718 --> 13:21.794
the cell phone's motherboard

13:21.872 --> 13:24.591
was partially
burned by the fire.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.763
So, what are you doing
with the heat gun,

13:26.772 --> 13:27.732
burning up the rest?

13:27.816 --> 13:29.865
No. The hot air
isn't gonna hurt it.

13:29.928 --> 13:31.497
I'm just using it to desolder

13:31.612 --> 13:34.325
the phone's primary
data storage chip.

13:34.411 --> 13:35.755
And as long as the chip

13:35.803 --> 13:38.203
wasn't... completely fried
in the fire,

13:38.296 --> 13:39.521
I should be able to use

13:39.582 --> 13:43.450
chip-off forensics
to retrieve the phone's data.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.466
Okay. Well, as soon as
you're done with that,

13:45.521 --> 13:47.287
I'm gonna need you to go
through the film footage

13:47.334 --> 13:48.379
Aubrey's sending over.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.794
Okay.
Oh! Oh...

13:49.897 --> 13:50.997
Oh. Can I do it, please?

13:51.045 --> 13:52.880
I love watching Campy b movies.

13:52.928 --> 13:54.404
Of course you do.

13:54.474 --> 13:56.935
All of them involving
giant man-eating bugs.

13:57.052 --> 13:58.568
I can't tell you how many times

13:58.669 --> 14:01.569
I've suffered
through <i> earwig armageddon.</i>

14:01.770 --> 14:03.896
Have you swabbed the injuries
on the victim's arm?

14:03.944 --> 14:07.084
I have, and I found, uh,
traces of keratin in the wounds.

14:07.132 --> 14:08.502
Like, from a fingernail?

14:08.550 --> 14:10.020
Or a razor-sharp claw.

14:10.088 --> 14:13.732
Specifically,
a razor-sharp panther claw.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.289
So, the victim
was self-financing

14:15.337 --> 14:17.294
the entire project. At
the time of his death,

14:17.342 --> 14:19.146
he'd already put up a
million bucks. Mm.

14:19.199 --> 14:21.177
Plenty of money,
plenty of motive.

14:21.732 --> 14:23.024
Yeah. Um, I don't know.

14:23.072 --> 14:25.216
I-I'm thinking about maybe
going a different route.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.467
I mean, you do know
that Ron was attacked

14:26.514 --> 14:28.341
by a panther on the set, right?

14:28.492 --> 14:30.403
You want me to bring
the panther in for questioning?

14:30.450 --> 14:33.154
No, no, no. But the guy
who supposedly trained it.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.865
This guy right here, uh,

14:34.962 --> 14:37.490
Dwayne Hawkins.
He did five years for assault

14:37.578 --> 14:41.060
with a deadly weapon, 'cause
his grizzly mauled another actor

14:41.188 --> 14:42.794
on a previous set.

14:42.858 --> 14:44.357
Right. Another incident
like that

14:44.405 --> 14:45.958
would certainly land him
back in jail.

14:46.055 --> 14:48.779
Yeah. You know. I'm just
thinking, maybe he decides

14:48.887 --> 14:50.575
to cover up the panther attack,

14:50.639 --> 14:52.411
kill Ron, make it look
like a suicide...

14:52.459 --> 14:55.286
I thought that I was supposed
to be lead on the case, here.

14:56.450 --> 14:58.060
I'm just trying to help.

14:58.154 --> 14:59.943
Appreciate that,
but you keep telling me

14:59.991 --> 15:01.201
where to go,
what leads to follow,

15:01.248 --> 15:03.185
wouldn't even let me
drive to the movie location.

15:03.233 --> 15:05.622
- You're like a turtle behind the wheel.
- You're like... What?

15:05.669 --> 15:08.630
A turtle. We would've
still been in the parking lot

15:08.705 --> 15:11.146
- right, but we would've got...
- If you were driving, Aubrey.

15:11.226 --> 15:12.576
- We would've got...
- That's my point.

15:12.623 --> 15:14.105
to let me work at my own pace, here.

15:14.255 --> 15:15.904
Fine. That's your case. Go ahead.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.420
- Thank you.
- Go ahead. Walk it out.

15:17.643 --> 15:19.035
- I will.
- Slow.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.841
You're still not driving.

15:21.738 --> 15:24.693
That is a pretty gnarly scar
you got there.

15:25.122 --> 15:28.107
Bald eagle tried to rip my eyes
out during a car commercial.

15:28.289 --> 15:29.969
Turns out they don't like
wearing top hats.

15:30.047 --> 15:32.333
Doesn't look like you got
the, uh, best record

15:32.381 --> 15:34.622
with these animals, Dwayne.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.225
You're talking about the
incident with Chauncey?

15:36.272 --> 15:38.638
Chauncey, yeah.
The, uh, man-eating bear

15:38.714 --> 15:39.825
that nearly killed an actor

15:39.881 --> 15:41.099
on the set of your last movie.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.919
I take full responsibility for
what happened on <i> Captain Carnie.</i>

15:44.172 --> 15:45.881
- But I served my sentence.
- Yeah, well maybe this time,

15:45.928 --> 15:48.177
you didn't want to serve
your sentence. See, we know

15:48.247 --> 15:50.217
that your panther attacked Ron.

15:50.521 --> 15:52.294
(chuckles)
it was a little scratch.

15:52.342 --> 15:53.785
I don't think
that counts as an attack.

15:53.832 --> 15:55.318
And that scratch
that had enough juice

15:55.421 --> 15:57.081
to put you back in jail.

15:57.263 --> 15:58.974
Ron got scratched
because he was careless.

15:59.033 --> 16:01.294
That's certainly true.
He hired you.

16:01.476 --> 16:04.446
Look. First, the guy tells me
he wants a cat,

16:04.557 --> 16:05.700
so I get him a Calico.

16:05.811 --> 16:07.871
Then he decides it's
got to be a panther.

16:08.136 --> 16:09.966
Well, all the panthers I know
are working.

16:10.271 --> 16:11.872
I scramble, but I find him one.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.538
Just some random panther,
off the street?

16:14.614 --> 16:16.144
Pretty much.
Okay.

16:16.216 --> 16:17.474
Which would've been fine,

16:17.544 --> 16:19.232
if I had a chance
to work with it.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.349
Ah. So Ron got scratched because
he didn't give you enough time

16:22.485 --> 16:24.193
to properly train the animal.

16:24.404 --> 16:26.341
The guy didn't know
what he was doing.

16:26.418 --> 16:27.969
When you're in charge
of a set with weapons,

16:28.016 --> 16:30.615
and stunts, and animals, and you
don't know what you're doing,

16:30.756 --> 16:31.956
people get hurt.

16:32.349 --> 16:34.732
And if anyone knows that,

16:35.505 --> 16:37.388
it's you.

16:38.682 --> 16:39.952
Yeah.

16:41.727 --> 16:44.763
Angie, step aside. I am
commandeering the Angelatron.

16:44.885 --> 16:46.445
Uh, I'm actually
kind of busy right now.

16:46.493 --> 16:48.271
Trust me. This is much,
much more important.

16:48.319 --> 16:49.497
Saroyan:
Well, it better be.

16:49.545 --> 16:51.700
I still have a pile of cooked
flesh I need to analyze.

16:51.748 --> 16:53.280
Okay. So I was looking
through the dailies,

16:53.327 --> 16:55.161
and look what I found.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.786
Why does that guy look familiar?

16:58.853 --> 17:00.685
Bray: Because that is
David Faustino.

17:00.785 --> 17:02.201
He played bud Bundy
on <i> married... With children</i>

17:02.248 --> 17:04.310
for like ten years.
I love that show.

17:04.367 --> 17:07.267
That's a good get
for <i> party panthers.</i>

17:07.685 --> 17:09.215
I'm sorry.
Is he on a roof?

17:09.263 --> 17:10.146
Well, not for long.

17:10.232 --> 17:12.661
Ron:
<i>And action!</i>

17:12.825 --> 17:15.060
<i>Suck my waves,</i>

17:15.215 --> 17:17.136
<i>Party Panthers!</i> (cackles)
(chuckles)

17:17.172 --> 17:18.536
(yells)

17:21.810 --> 17:24.210
(crashes, shouts)

17:24.246 --> 17:27.660
man: <i> Guys, you all right?</i> Oh, ow.
That sounds like it hurt.

17:27.708 --> 17:30.051
(growling, screaming)
<i>you son of a bitch, Ron!</i>

17:30.099 --> 17:32.435
<i>You could've gotten me killed!</i>

17:32.927 --> 17:35.544
<i>I should break your stupid
little freaking neck!</i>

17:35.599 --> 17:37.427
(screams)

17:38.161 --> 17:39.450
<i>cut!</i>

17:39.732 --> 17:42.740
It sounds like bud Bundy
just threatened our victim.

17:45.119 --> 17:47.119
(giggling, panting)

17:50.393 --> 17:52.233
ladies.

17:52.512 --> 17:54.812
So, Mr. Faustino.

17:54.934 --> 17:56.990
Uh, what am I, your grandpa?

17:57.112 --> 17:58.888
Call me tino.
Okay.

17:59.016 --> 18:01.638
According to the Internet, you
got kicked off your last movie

18:01.731 --> 18:02.905
for fighting with the director.

18:02.952 --> 18:03.965
Okay, dude,

18:04.013 --> 18:05.513
I've auditioned
to play cops before.

18:05.561 --> 18:07.950
Okay? I know the drill.
Just get to your point.

18:08.031 --> 18:09.139
You got a history of violence
towards directors,

18:09.186 --> 18:11.474
you threatened to kill
your current director,

18:11.522 --> 18:13.411
and now he's dead. How's that?

18:13.518 --> 18:15.575
Okay, well. I fought
with my last director

18:15.675 --> 18:18.177
because I wanted to do action,
and that slapdick

18:18.225 --> 18:20.896
only saw me as a comedy guy.
I mean, come on.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.170
Okay? But <i> Party</i>
<i>Panthers</i> is different.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.873
Ron let me showcase my muscles.

18:24.921 --> 18:26.366
Let me be an action star.
And that's why

18:26.413 --> 18:27.709
I loved working with him.

18:27.844 --> 18:29.608
Okay. 'cause I saw the footage.

18:29.711 --> 18:31.851
Didn't really look like
you loved working with him.

18:32.176 --> 18:34.084
Yeah. Well, that, uh...
That stunt mishap

18:34.132 --> 18:35.545
made me look like a punk.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.233
Okay? I was embarrassed.
And when I get embarrassed,

18:38.306 --> 18:39.733
I get pissed.

18:39.825 --> 18:40.959
Yeah. Really pissed.

18:41.065 --> 18:43.935
Like vein-popping pissed.

18:44.626 --> 18:47.420
What can I say?
I'm a passionate man.

18:47.951 --> 18:50.178
But ultimately, I realized
the stunt was my fault.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.225
Okay? It was my idea.
I was the one pushing it on Ron.

18:53.316 --> 18:55.516
I was so excited about it,
I probably didn't give him

18:55.567 --> 18:57.084
enough time
to properly plan it out.

18:57.132 --> 18:58.655
Right. Hurry up and shoot.

18:58.746 --> 19:01.037
That seems to be the theme
of this movie.

19:01.199 --> 19:03.229
Yeah, well. You ever
heard the saying,

19:03.277 --> 19:04.737
"time is money?"

19:04.879 --> 19:07.014
well, this is a
low-budget movie.

19:07.069 --> 19:08.269
Yeah.

19:08.405 --> 19:10.061
<i>Was</i> a low-budget movie.

19:10.325 --> 19:11.405
You guys are done.

19:11.489 --> 19:12.719
Whoa, whoa. Dude, bro.

19:13.015 --> 19:14.506
We only have
a couple scenes left.

19:14.585 --> 19:15.944
You can't just shut us down.

19:15.992 --> 19:17.530
Oh, sure I
can. And, uh,

19:17.578 --> 19:19.374
if I were you, I'd hold off
on booking my ticket

19:19.421 --> 19:21.091
back to L.A. Just yet.

19:25.444 --> 19:27.905
Hey, Angie. So I've been
watching more of the dailies.

19:27.953 --> 19:28.966
Uh, I don't care.

19:29.014 --> 19:30.709
You are not taking
over my monitor again.

19:30.757 --> 19:33.600
No, no, no. So, Faustino.
He plays this character

19:33.648 --> 19:35.078
named "Pamanther."

19:35.222 --> 19:36.436
half man,

19:36.523 --> 19:38.493
half panther. Why?

19:38.690 --> 19:41.660
Because sometimes the only way
to stop a panther

19:42.185 --> 19:45.415
is to become a panther.

19:46.162 --> 19:47.598
That makes no sense.

19:47.646 --> 19:49.786
And yet, still, it is awesome.

19:49.859 --> 19:51.066
(chuckles)
what's going on here?

19:51.113 --> 19:52.405
Uh, I'm sorting

19:52.453 --> 19:54.592
through some texts
on the victim's phone.

19:54.667 --> 19:55.795
Anything good?

19:55.843 --> 19:56.951
Here's one, from the owner

19:56.999 --> 19:59.037
of Funtown Amusement Park.

19:59.117 --> 20:02.162
Allen pPppermelt, threatening
to gut Ron like a pig

20:02.210 --> 20:04.865
and use his intestines as floss.

20:05.230 --> 20:06.709
Funtown?

20:06.928 --> 20:08.639
Didn't we bring
Michael Vincent there once?

20:08.687 --> 20:10.600
Yeah. It was awful.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.637
Remember, they gave us those
used stuffed animals as prizes?

20:14.790 --> 20:16.716
Oh. Geez.
That's right.

20:17.231 --> 20:18.645
Hey, Angie. Do me a favor.

20:18.693 --> 20:20.270
Call up a picture of Funtown.

20:20.407 --> 20:22.877
(beeping)

20:24.169 --> 20:25.553
wait.

20:25.715 --> 20:27.810
Angie, can you zoom underneath
the the fountain there?

20:27.857 --> 20:29.505
Yeah.

20:30.375 --> 20:31.605
Wow.

20:31.854 --> 20:33.380
White marble chips.

20:33.592 --> 20:36.247
That's exactly what I found
on the victim's shoe tread.

20:36.453 --> 20:39.505
Okay. Let's look
at the production schedule.

20:42.364 --> 20:43.606
Yeah.

20:43.669 --> 20:45.645
Ron shot there three weeks ago.

20:45.750 --> 20:48.739
Then what was he doing back
there on the night of his death?

20:53.288 --> 20:55.528
(exhales)

20:55.692 --> 20:57.122
Dr. Mayer...

20:57.270 --> 20:59.583
Oh. I was returning from lunch

20:59.631 --> 21:01.536
and the supervisor
said you'd left word.

21:01.602 --> 21:04.677
I did. And I appreciate you coming by.

21:05.117 --> 21:06.947
Oh.

21:08.574 --> 21:10.614
I'm sorry
for being a nosey norm.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.810
I saw the title of your paper,

21:12.890 --> 21:15.528
and I just got pulled in.

21:15.795 --> 21:19.403
"A study of the devolution
of the human species."

21:19.503 --> 21:22.255
that was one
of my dissertations.

21:22.342 --> 21:23.958
I had a lot of fun with it.

21:24.081 --> 21:29.052
Clearly. Your enthusiasm
just jumps off the page.

21:29.364 --> 21:30.950
(chuckles)
actually...

21:31.096 --> 21:33.966
That is what I was hoping
to speak with you about.

21:34.395 --> 21:36.122
How do you know?

21:36.592 --> 21:38.192
How do I know what, dear?

21:38.489 --> 21:40.778
When you've lost
your passion for your work.

21:40.826 --> 21:43.239
You said that you
woke up one morning

21:43.287 --> 21:45.247
and realized that it was gone.

21:45.433 --> 21:48.059
If you're used
to that electricity

21:48.107 --> 21:51.552
dancing through your veins
and suddenly it's not there,

21:51.803 --> 21:53.303
you notice.

21:54.841 --> 21:58.411
What if you're not that
in tune with yourself?

21:58.642 --> 22:02.536
Is it possible to lose
your drive and not know?

22:02.765 --> 22:06.835
Absolutely. In fact,
that's what usually happens.

22:07.142 --> 22:08.762
How many people do you know

22:08.810 --> 22:12.223
who are truly in touch
with their feelings?

22:12.381 --> 22:13.770
Well, not many.

22:13.818 --> 22:15.770
(both laugh)
Exactly.

22:15.974 --> 22:17.661
Here's a little test.

22:17.739 --> 22:20.294
Think about what you do here.

22:20.402 --> 22:22.036
Really focus on it.

22:22.397 --> 22:23.637
Okay.

22:23.761 --> 22:27.645
Now, how would you feel
if someone took it away?

22:30.012 --> 22:31.281
(knocking)

22:31.426 --> 22:33.122
sorry to interrupt,
but I've finished

22:33.170 --> 22:34.371
reconstructing
the victim's skull,

22:34.418 --> 22:35.403
and I found something.

22:35.451 --> 22:37.051
My apologies, Dr. Mayer.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.739
Nonsense.

22:39.007 --> 22:41.520
I believe we've answered
all your questions.

22:43.073 --> 22:44.575
I believe we have.

22:45.612 --> 22:47.612
(chuckles)

22:49.834 --> 22:51.234
(sighs)

22:53.166 --> 22:55.726
amongst the postmortem
fracturing caused by the fall,

22:55.799 --> 22:58.329
I found plenty of
perimortem fracturing.

23:00.351 --> 23:03.262
The injury is severe enough
to be cause of death.

23:03.330 --> 23:05.677
However, the broad impact
area leads me to believe

23:05.764 --> 23:08.216
this trauma was not caused
by the same cylindrical object

23:08.264 --> 23:09.528
used to beat the victim.

23:09.678 --> 23:13.958
Well, it was most likely the
result of the victim's skull

23:14.082 --> 23:18.731
being smashed into a flat
surface with great force.

23:21.382 --> 23:24.382
But not long before Ron's death,
you sent him a text.

23:24.430 --> 23:26.239
"remove the fake blood
from my teacups

23:26.287 --> 23:29.184
"or I'll gut you like a pig
and use your intestines

23:29.232 --> 23:30.833
<i>as floss."</i>

23:30.966 --> 23:33.091
oh, man.
That sounds pretty bad, huh?

23:33.166 --> 23:35.208
Yeah. It sounds really bad,
and honestly,

23:35.285 --> 23:37.692
it's not what I'd expect
from the owner of Funtown.

23:37.740 --> 23:41.473
Just my luck. The one time
I try to get tough with someone,

23:41.640 --> 23:42.817
they end up dead.

23:42.905 --> 23:44.505
This guy is pathetic.

23:44.567 --> 23:46.467
<i>We can tear him down with fear.</i>

23:48.186 --> 23:49.895
I know that
you didn't kill Ron, okay?

23:49.948 --> 23:51.808
But I'm gonna need you
to help me out here.

23:51.999 --> 23:54.130
Great, or we just
do the opposite.

23:54.399 --> 23:56.153
Aubrey: <i>We have evidence
suggesting that</i>

23:56.201 --> 23:58.887
Ron was at your business
on the night of his death.

23:59.028 --> 24:01.198
No, I haven't seen Ron
in a few weeks.

24:01.418 --> 24:03.497
My God, he's lying, okay?
Get in his face.

24:03.545 --> 24:04.745
Tell him that we can nail him.

24:04.794 --> 24:06.239
- <i>Pin him against the wall.</i>
- Look.

24:06.555 --> 24:08.028
You seem like a nice guy, Allen.

24:08.076 --> 24:10.028
<i>So, what makes
a nice guy threaten</i>

24:10.076 --> 24:12.770
to gut a man and use
his intestines as floss?

24:12.866 --> 24:14.696
Well, Ron Came to me
about a month ago,

24:14.782 --> 24:18.356
asking if he could use Funtown
as a location for his movie.

24:18.539 --> 24:20.387
He said it was a pivotal scene

24:20.458 --> 24:24.059
about a sick boy visiting
his first amusement park.

24:24.273 --> 24:26.012
<i>So I gave him the Park
for the day.</i>

24:26.098 --> 24:27.911
Then I show up to see
how things are going.

24:27.986 --> 24:29.226
It was a madhouse.

24:29.309 --> 24:31.239
There was no sick boy.

24:31.363 --> 24:32.637
Just a bunch of blood

24:32.685 --> 24:34.925
and guts and topless women.

24:35.123 --> 24:36.169
He duped you.

24:36.248 --> 24:39.098
And old Allen Peppermelt
fell for it.

24:39.256 --> 24:42.419
Took me four days to clean up
all that blood and guts.

24:42.521 --> 24:45.091
I lost over a thousand dollars.

24:45.201 --> 24:46.528
And if you killed Ron,

24:46.576 --> 24:48.046
you never would've gotten
your money,

24:48.158 --> 24:50.888
so how did you intend
to get your money back?

24:51.248 --> 24:55.130
I was gonna sue...
But then I remembered Carly.

24:55.239 --> 24:56.278
Who's Carly?

24:56.405 --> 24:57.905
Carly Catalano.

24:58.003 --> 25:00.833
<i>She works the funnel cake stand
at funtown.</i>

25:01.106 --> 25:03.098
She's also an aspiring actress,

25:03.215 --> 25:06.185
and I told Ron if he gave Carly
a part in the movie,

25:06.250 --> 25:08.177
I'd reconsider my lawsuit.

25:08.308 --> 25:11.536
Wow, so you sacrificed
a thousand dollars

25:11.646 --> 25:14.137
in order to get one of your
employees an acting job?

25:14.336 --> 25:17.091
I was hoping it would
finally convince Carly

25:17.180 --> 25:19.520
to go on a date with me.

25:19.759 --> 25:21.519
It didn't.

25:25.647 --> 25:27.833
So, how's it coming
with the Funtown marble?

25:27.935 --> 25:30.006
The smoothness of the grain
is inconsistent with the chips

25:30.053 --> 25:32.372
that I found
in the victim's shoe tread.

25:32.542 --> 25:35.059
So, he wasn't at Funtown
on the night of his death.

25:35.246 --> 25:36.739
Nope. Now that
that's resolved,

25:36.811 --> 25:39.041
it's time to get back
to the Party Panther Party.

25:39.134 --> 25:40.497
Or you could help me out.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.614
Yeah, um, can that wait?
Because I'm just at the scene

25:42.661 --> 25:44.137
where the drug dealer
accidentally feeds

25:44.184 --> 25:45.843
his pet panthers
radioactive meat.

25:45.934 --> 25:48.048
Yeah, so...

25:48.184 --> 25:50.294
I just finished going
through the charred tissue,

25:50.382 --> 25:52.567
and found another panther
scratch on the victim's neck.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.854
Makes sense, seeing as
he was attacked by a panther.

25:56.036 --> 25:57.618
According to hospital records,

25:57.677 --> 25:59.747
he was only treated for
scratches to the forearm.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.997
Wait, so you think he was
attacked a second time?

26:02.434 --> 26:04.458
I don't know. We shall swab
and see, or rather,

26:04.506 --> 26:07.145
you shall swab and see
and I will find out

26:07.193 --> 26:08.864
what happens
with the radioactive meat.

26:08.946 --> 26:11.270
No, Cam, come on.
You don't even like the movie.

26:11.348 --> 26:14.075
Cam, come on now. Cam.

26:15.145 --> 26:16.736
(sighs)

26:16.856 --> 26:18.875
Ron:
<i>Oh, come on, Chad. Come on.</i>

26:19.012 --> 26:20.211
<i>Roar!</i>
(meekly roaring)

26:20.286 --> 26:21.841
hey, hey,
what happened back there?

26:21.895 --> 26:23.528
I mean, what's the point
of having me in your ear

26:23.575 --> 26:25.102
if you're not gonna
listen to me?

26:25.172 --> 26:26.617
Well, I wasn't listening because
peppermelt isn't our guy.

26:26.664 --> 26:27.697
I mean,
if I'd taken your advice,

26:27.744 --> 26:29.153
he would have shut down
and given us nothing.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.297
Worked out that way, anyway.

26:30.344 --> 26:31.546
Well, actually, no...

26:31.594 --> 26:34.821
Because he gave us this.

26:36.039 --> 26:37.077
<i>I've collected...</i>

26:37.125 --> 26:38.269
What the hell is that?

26:38.343 --> 26:39.443
You got to be kidding me.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.200
<i>I've confined...</i>

26:41.306 --> 26:42.576
(sighs)

26:44.110 --> 26:46.469
<i>I confiled all of the data,</i>

26:46.704 --> 26:49.899
<i>and the numbers
seem to suggest...</i>

26:51.782 --> 26:55.008
This is bad, even by
<i>Party Panthers</i> standards.

26:55.056 --> 26:56.133
She's bad.

26:56.186 --> 26:58.579
So, this is
Peppermelt's employee,

26:58.684 --> 27:01.914
the one that he convinced Ron
to recast in the female lead.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.250
Recast?
Meaning someone got fired?

27:04.391 --> 27:05.625
Exactly.

27:05.724 --> 27:09.399
Well, if I was fired
and replaced by... That,

27:09.447 --> 27:10.701
I'd want to commit murder, too.

27:10.729 --> 27:11.999
I was thinking the same thing,

27:12.031 --> 27:15.404
so I looked
into the original actor.

27:15.678 --> 27:17.639
This is a picture
of a young boy.

27:17.740 --> 27:19.436
Yeah. I know.

27:19.490 --> 27:23.662
Joey Martucci was
originally cast in this role.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.309
<i>Um...</i>

27:25.344 --> 27:26.544
What?

27:26.578 --> 27:28.068
I know, I can't explain that,

27:28.139 --> 27:29.380
but I did find out

27:29.428 --> 27:30.845
that his mother
was arrested last year

27:30.883 --> 27:32.264
on charges
of assault and battery

27:32.389 --> 27:34.225
after beating a man
with a baseball bat.

27:34.311 --> 27:35.953
Sounds like a woman
with a lot of rage.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.225
And how do you think
Mrs. Martucci felt

27:37.272 --> 27:38.295
when she found out that

27:38.343 --> 27:39.701
her son was getting fired

27:39.858 --> 27:41.967
and replaced by her?

27:42.467 --> 27:44.467
<i>By my calculations,</i>

27:44.615 --> 27:47.693
<i>we have seven hours
until the panthers merge</i>

27:47.795 --> 27:51.503
into one giant mega-panther.

27:53.452 --> 27:57.062
We were out at the batting cages
when this man recognized Joey

27:57.123 --> 27:58.475
from a snoozeland commercial.

27:58.545 --> 28:00.015
The guy was clearly drunk,

28:00.063 --> 28:02.093
saying all sorts of rude things.

28:02.255 --> 28:03.853
H-he wouldn't leave us
alone, so finally...

28:03.900 --> 28:05.900
You whacked him
with a baseball bat.

28:06.639 --> 28:08.311
And I'd gladly do it again,

28:08.363 --> 28:10.756
but this time I'd aim
right for his beans.

28:10.850 --> 28:13.818
You seem like a very protective
mother, Mrs. Martucci.

28:13.972 --> 28:15.350
You say it like
it's a bad thing.

28:15.398 --> 28:18.170
Well, I'm just wondering
if that instinct kicked back in

28:18.326 --> 28:21.256
when you learned that Ron was
firing your son from his movie.

28:21.428 --> 28:23.334
(laughing):
Oh, please.

28:23.539 --> 28:25.939
Colead in a movie
starring David Faustino.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.937
Seems like a pretty
decent size credit

28:27.985 --> 28:30.125
for a kid trying
to start an acting career.

28:30.228 --> 28:32.006
At a certain point,
it just isn't worth it.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.397
What do you mean?

28:33.514 --> 28:35.107
Ronny
Came to us with this script

28:35.160 --> 28:36.700
he'd written about a sick kid

28:36.729 --> 28:39.006
who loses himself
in his imagination,

28:39.170 --> 28:42.084
pretending his pet cat
is a giant panther,

28:42.171 --> 28:45.186
and his-his sandbox is
a beautiful Florida Beach.

28:45.308 --> 28:48.654
It was this really adorable
little story.

28:48.847 --> 28:51.857
This is <i> Radioactive Party</i>
<i>Panthers from Fort Lauderdale</i>

28:51.905 --> 28:52.912
you're talking about?

28:52.960 --> 28:53.998
It only beCame that

28:54.046 --> 28:55.389
after Faustino signed on.

28:55.467 --> 28:56.825
That's when we started getting

28:56.873 --> 28:58.662
all these ridiculous rewrites.

28:58.717 --> 29:01.295
I'm talking real bologna here.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.506
The whole movie changed,
became this big shoot 'em up.

29:04.662 --> 29:06.100
We weren't interested in that.

29:06.148 --> 29:09.326
Wow. So, it sounds like Ron
was actually doing you a favor

29:09.374 --> 29:11.744
- by firing Joey.
- He was.

29:11.936 --> 29:13.170
Ronny was a sweetheart.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.498
He just got caught up
and taken for a ride.

29:15.734 --> 29:16.967
You got to be careful.

29:17.076 --> 29:20.036
This industry will eat you alive
if you let it.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.092
Hey, do you need
anything else, Dr. B?

29:27.434 --> 29:28.634
No.

29:28.717 --> 29:30.459
Enjoy your evening.
You, too.

29:30.507 --> 29:32.451
Uh, thanks again
for the dissertations.

29:32.499 --> 29:34.300
Who knows, maybe I'll be
so inspired I'll end up

29:34.347 --> 29:36.365
writing multiple papers myself.

29:37.178 --> 29:39.147
Just focus on the one, Mr. Bray.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.211
(chuckles)

29:52.959 --> 29:55.635
hey, you're still here?

29:56.497 --> 29:58.127
Yes. I-I used to get

29:58.180 --> 30:01.080
some of my best work done

30:01.195 --> 30:03.265
after the lab had shut down
for the night.

30:03.415 --> 30:04.897
Is everything okay?

30:04.981 --> 30:07.668
There appears to be evidence
of buckle fracturing

30:07.752 --> 30:10.552
on the angles
of the right side ribs

30:10.600 --> 30:12.070
seven, eight and nine.

30:12.206 --> 30:13.906
I meant with you.

30:14.264 --> 30:16.599
You've been distant all day.

30:19.164 --> 30:22.124
Angela, do you believe
in passion in the workplace?

30:22.925 --> 30:24.622
Well, given that Hodgins and I

30:24.670 --> 30:28.037
have been caught in
the Egyptian room a few times...

30:28.256 --> 30:30.701
I-I meant professionally.

30:30.943 --> 30:33.217
Oh. How important do you think it is

30:33.265 --> 30:35.735
for us to love what we do?

30:36.272 --> 30:39.850
Uh, well, it, it's important,
but it's not everything.

30:40.115 --> 30:42.279
Most people
don't love their jobs.

30:42.523 --> 30:44.068
They don't even like them.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.459
They do them because
they have to.

30:46.700 --> 30:48.270
What if they didn't have to?

30:48.359 --> 30:50.584
If you can afford to leave
an unfulfilling job,

30:50.661 --> 30:51.662
why wouldn't you?

30:51.754 --> 30:53.240
- Are you...?
- Just curious.

30:53.288 --> 30:54.506
That's all.

30:54.577 --> 30:56.947
Left side ribs
seven, eight, and nine

30:57.026 --> 31:00.295
also show evidence
of buckle fracturing.

31:00.448 --> 31:03.584
The presence of these
injuries suggests

31:03.704 --> 31:06.272
a substantial amount of weight
having been applied

31:06.451 --> 31:07.756
to the victim's chest.

31:07.925 --> 31:10.889
As if the killer
sat on the victim

31:10.983 --> 31:13.318
while smashing his head in.

31:13.586 --> 31:17.100
That sounds like a very
violent way to kill someone.

31:17.787 --> 31:20.967
It speaks more
to a crime of passion.

31:21.281 --> 31:23.721
I'll inform Aubrey.

31:23.962 --> 31:27.787
I know you're concerned
about me, Angela,

31:27.916 --> 31:31.116
and I really am okay.

31:34.216 --> 31:35.740
Booth: <i>Geez, I thought
I was in early.</i>

31:35.804 --> 31:36.840
Look at you.

31:36.888 --> 31:39.631
No, you are.
I'm just here late.

31:39.895 --> 31:41.295
You been here all night?

31:41.431 --> 31:43.857
Yeah. I'm comparing
the shooting draft

31:43.960 --> 31:45.890
of the script with
the earlier version

31:45.984 --> 31:47.644
that Barb Martucci sent over.

31:47.717 --> 31:49.725
Uh-huh. Wow.

31:49.773 --> 31:52.109
These are all the changes
that, uh, Faustino made

31:52.157 --> 31:53.209
when he got on?

31:53.257 --> 31:54.889
So in a course of three weeks,

31:54.937 --> 31:57.537
he completely rewrote
Ron's entire movie.

31:57.912 --> 32:00.287
Okay, well, Ron was
financing the project.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.857
Why would he give up
control like that?

32:01.922 --> 32:04.287
Well, he gave up control the
minute that he hired Faustino.

32:04.335 --> 32:07.037
Faustino was the name
that was gonna sell Ron's movie.

32:07.132 --> 32:08.912
Right. If he didn't have him,

32:08.996 --> 32:11.326
then he would just have
an expensive home video.

32:11.413 --> 32:13.243
And on the day of Ron's death,

32:13.312 --> 32:15.240
Faustino rewrote
the final portion

32:15.311 --> 32:16.639
of the original script.

32:16.715 --> 32:18.451
I mean, Ron's sweet little movie

32:18.572 --> 32:20.702
was officially over.

32:20.953 --> 32:22.467
You think that was
his breaking point?

32:22.576 --> 32:24.576
Well, eventually you either
give up or you fight back.

32:24.623 --> 32:26.590
I think maybe Ron decided
to fight back.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.256
That's what got him killed.

32:28.342 --> 32:30.397
Good work, Aubrey.
Look at you.

32:30.943 --> 32:33.045
You just killed that one, huh?

32:33.198 --> 32:35.607
You earned those bags
under your eyes.

32:38.053 --> 32:39.662
Cam, you were right.

32:39.710 --> 32:41.904
The scratch on the victim's
neck was from a panther.

32:42.143 --> 32:43.420
So the trainer lied to us.

32:43.515 --> 32:44.912
Well, no, not exactly.

32:45.006 --> 32:47.381
May I? So the panther claw
that created the wound

32:47.459 --> 32:48.842
wasn't made of keratin.

32:48.912 --> 32:50.647
It was made of
polyurethane resin.

32:50.842 --> 32:52.514
Wait, a fake panther claw?

32:52.562 --> 32:54.262
A Party Panther claw.

32:54.615 --> 32:56.669
So, we're gonna need
to test everyone

32:56.717 --> 32:57.943
in the panther suits
used in the movie.

32:57.990 --> 32:59.052
Or just one.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.561
See, I also found

33:00.615 --> 33:03.909
neon-orange aerosol
paint particulates in the wound.

33:04.295 --> 33:05.863
Well, great.
Which one of the actors

33:05.898 --> 33:07.098
wore the orange panther suit?

33:07.132 --> 33:08.372
Why don't I show you?

33:08.400 --> 33:09.880
Why don't you just tell me?

33:09.928 --> 33:11.035
I think it'll have
a bigger impact...

33:11.069 --> 33:12.428
- Hodgins, just...
- Pamanther.

33:12.482 --> 33:15.232
Pamanther wears a
neon-orange panther claw.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.514
Isn't that the character
David Faustino played?

33:17.576 --> 33:20.107
Sometimes the only way
to stop a panther

33:20.499 --> 33:22.699
is to become a Panther.

33:23.575 --> 33:26.085
Man, I still got it.
I mean, look at me.

33:27.482 --> 33:29.334
Oh. What's the...
What up?

33:29.420 --> 33:31.286
What's the <i> bone of contention</i>
dude doing here?

33:31.334 --> 33:32.275
Got to be kidding me.

33:32.309 --> 33:33.609
We're questioning you
for murder, pal.

33:33.644 --> 33:35.044
Well, I must be
in some serious heat

33:35.110 --> 33:36.480
if you brought in the big gun.

33:36.568 --> 33:39.016
Uh, actually, I'm
the big gun on this.

33:39.103 --> 33:43.445
Uh, yeah, I know big guns,
and you are not a big gun.

33:43.734 --> 33:46.390
Hey, you know I auditioned for
the role of agent Andy, right?

33:46.438 --> 33:48.093
I mean, I would have
been playing you.

33:48.170 --> 33:49.592
- How crazy is that?
- Nope.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.609
How's that for a big gun, huh?

33:51.766 --> 33:54.262
Techs found Ron's blood
on your panther arm.

33:54.367 --> 33:56.656
Sounds like pamanther has
a little explaining to do.

33:56.704 --> 33:58.388
And we know that you took
an axe to Ron's script,

33:58.435 --> 33:59.765
turned it into quite the turd,

33:59.804 --> 34:01.764
if you ask me.

34:01.945 --> 34:04.106
<i>Party Panthers</i> was not
a turd, okay?

34:04.164 --> 34:05.367
Booth: Well, it was
because of you,

34:05.414 --> 34:06.596
and Ron was sick of it.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.304
So he decided to confront you,

34:08.375 --> 34:10.570
and that's when your
famous temper took over.

34:10.648 --> 34:12.585
You attacked Ron, you
climbed on top of him,

34:12.683 --> 34:13.922
smashed his head in.

34:14.101 --> 34:16.572
Okay, Ron was the one
who attacked me.

34:16.648 --> 34:18.760
All I did was ask for
a "written by" credit.

34:18.835 --> 34:20.889
Dude just snapped,
Came charging at me.

34:20.945 --> 34:22.219
I mean, I must have
scratched him

34:22.266 --> 34:23.493
while trying to fight him off.

34:23.527 --> 34:24.927
So you killed him
in self-defense?

34:25.234 --> 34:27.331
I didn't kill Ron, okay?

34:27.364 --> 34:28.623
I just held him down

34:28.672 --> 34:29.915
to get him to stop freaking out.

34:29.962 --> 34:31.531
I mean, the guy was raging.

34:31.598 --> 34:33.268
He said I ruined everything.

34:33.416 --> 34:35.386
Doesn't sound like he was wrong.

34:37.378 --> 34:39.031
Whatever, man.
All I know is that

34:39.097 --> 34:41.531
Ron gave me the credit,
we made our peace,

34:41.609 --> 34:43.975
then he left... that's the
last time I saw the guy.

34:44.023 --> 34:45.453
But why did you fail
to mention that

34:45.536 --> 34:47.922
to Agent Aubrey last time
you talked to him?

34:48.391 --> 34:50.000
Who's Aubrey?

34:50.507 --> 34:51.882
Aubrey:
Are you kidding?

34:52.068 --> 34:53.484
I'm Aubrey.

34:57.494 --> 34:58.954
If people hear I got
into another fight

34:58.996 --> 34:59.956
with a director,

34:59.997 --> 35:01.157
I'll be uninsurable.

35:01.198 --> 35:02.836
My career will be over.

35:02.942 --> 35:04.672
- Please, Agent Andy...
- Uh...

35:04.735 --> 35:06.516
This has to stay between
the two of us.

35:06.586 --> 35:07.891
Aubrey:
The two of you?

35:07.969 --> 35:09.273
- Seriously?
- I don't know.

35:09.321 --> 35:11.305
I'm two feet away from the man.
I don't get this guy.

35:11.352 --> 35:12.978
If Faustino smashed
the victim's skull

35:13.010 --> 35:14.438
into the ground,

35:14.497 --> 35:16.561
he would have had
direct contact with it

35:16.609 --> 35:17.711
during the murder.

35:17.759 --> 35:19.805
And if he was still
wearing the panther claw...

35:19.914 --> 35:22.164
Well, actually,
I think I found something

35:22.250 --> 35:24.141
on the margins
of the <i> foramen Magnum.</i>

35:25.289 --> 35:27.328
Oh, yes, the ring fracture,

35:27.422 --> 35:30.180
caused by the fall
from the overpass.

35:30.305 --> 35:34.289
I noted this injury early
in the investigation, Mr. Bray.

35:34.531 --> 35:36.731
No, uh, underneath it.
Hemorrhagic staining.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.781
Evidence of another
ring fracture.

35:43.422 --> 35:45.036
You're correct.

35:45.555 --> 35:48.344
It appears the victim
fell before he fell.

35:48.453 --> 35:49.734
If he landed on his head,

35:49.789 --> 35:51.093
that could have caused
the trauma

35:51.141 --> 35:52.345
to the back of his skull.

35:52.470 --> 35:55.571
Had he fallen from a height
greater than two stories,

35:55.766 --> 35:57.349
we would have found extensive

35:57.388 --> 35:59.641
perimortem fracturing
on the internal Bones.

35:59.722 --> 36:02.055
So the victim was whacked
with a cylindrical object,

36:02.177 --> 36:04.547
then thrown off a one-
to two-story building.

36:04.633 --> 36:06.210
Unfortunately, the height
of the building

36:06.257 --> 36:07.818
will not help us
narrow down the search,

36:07.898 --> 36:10.438
but maybe the type of roof will.

36:10.633 --> 36:12.197
So in addition to landscaping,

36:12.273 --> 36:14.236
white marble chips
are occasionally used

36:14.313 --> 36:15.969
as surface material on roofs.

36:16.028 --> 36:17.992
And one of those roofs
is on snoozeland.

36:18.156 --> 36:19.596
Do we know how tall
this building is?

36:19.648 --> 36:21.397
Yeah, according
to the calculations,

36:21.445 --> 36:23.551
the building is 23 feet tall.

36:23.599 --> 36:25.313
Roughly two stories.

36:25.398 --> 36:26.679
Brennan:
It's the flagpoles.

36:26.805 --> 36:29.141
The width of the poles
appears to be a match

36:29.203 --> 36:31.959
for the damage found on the
victim's scapula and sacrum.

36:32.047 --> 36:33.813
So the victim was
pushed off the building,

36:33.861 --> 36:35.058
and hit the poles
on the way down.

36:35.105 --> 36:37.398
Then the killer threw the body
off an overpass

36:37.461 --> 36:39.484
to disguise the initial fall.

36:40.016 --> 36:41.800
The blood on the
flagpoles confirms

36:41.883 --> 36:43.586
that Ron was killed
at snoozeland.

36:43.657 --> 36:46.927
Ron left Faustino's trailer
around midnight.

36:47.304 --> 36:48.852
The body was thrown
over the overpass

36:48.969 --> 36:50.023
about six hours later.

36:50.094 --> 36:52.561
According to the time sheets,
the only person at snoozeland

36:52.609 --> 36:53.882
between 12:00 and 6:00

36:53.930 --> 36:56.311
- was Linda.
- Linda says she hadn't seen him in weeks.

36:56.359 --> 36:57.711
Right. So what was he doing
back there?

36:57.758 --> 37:00.044
The guy's in the middle
of directing a movie.

37:00.164 --> 37:01.625
Look, it's like what you said.

37:01.703 --> 37:04.750
At a certain point,
either you fight back

37:04.813 --> 37:05.788
- or you give up.
- Okay.

37:05.859 --> 37:07.443
So Ron...
Ron was giving up.

37:07.491 --> 37:10.258
He was going back to where
he felt that he belonged.

37:10.344 --> 37:13.242
Look, having Ron back would
only make Linda's job easier.

37:13.305 --> 37:15.352
Why would she kill him?

37:15.516 --> 37:17.758
Because it wasn't about ease.

37:17.953 --> 37:19.965
(door shuts)

37:20.500 --> 37:21.834
(beeps)

37:21.914 --> 37:23.942
<i>so Ron coming back to work meant</i>

37:23.974 --> 37:26.404
that you were going back
to being his number two.

37:26.539 --> 37:28.031
Ron was coming back to work?

37:28.125 --> 37:31.172
This was supposed to be
your time to shine, Linda.

37:31.264 --> 37:32.504
This was your chance
to finally prove

37:32.551 --> 37:33.867
what you could do...

37:33.992 --> 37:35.744
to finally, after
all these years,

37:35.786 --> 37:37.086
crawl out from under

37:37.142 --> 37:39.912
your boss's big, looming shadow.

37:42.993 --> 37:45.297
And all you wanted
was an opportunity

37:45.345 --> 37:46.805
to show yourself,

37:47.148 --> 37:49.367
your friends, your family

37:49.547 --> 37:51.250
that you had what it took.

37:51.406 --> 37:53.219
<i>And here he was waltzing back in</i>

37:53.352 --> 37:55.969
<i>and throwing that
big shadow right over you.</i>

37:57.117 --> 37:59.336
He was sitting up there smoking.

37:59.543 --> 38:00.943
He said the movie was a mistake

38:00.978 --> 38:02.187
and he was coming back to work.

38:02.234 --> 38:04.094
And I was working so hard.

38:04.181 --> 38:06.281
I couldn't go back
to being his sidekick again,

38:06.336 --> 38:07.546
and it just happened.

38:07.584 --> 38:11.014
I just... Pushed him.

38:13.477 --> 38:14.887
Linda Martin,
you're under arrest

38:15.018 --> 38:16.848

I was so excited
to write my dissertations,

40:56.355 --> 40:58.556
because I loved
what I was doing,

40:58.636 --> 41:01.119
and I couldn't wait
to keep learning.

41:01.488 --> 41:04.066
I just haven't found
the right topic yet.

41:05.041 --> 41:07.956

in the field of anthropology.
