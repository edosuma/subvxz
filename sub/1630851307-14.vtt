WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.214
Previously, on "Below
Deck Mediterranean"...

00:07.507 --> 00:09.134
I just wanna pay for
anyone but Lexi.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.135
She had bad parents.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.469
No, my parents are amazing.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.554
Your parents
should have aborted you.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.431
-Whoa.
-Oh!

00:14.472 --> 00:16.141
If this wasn't on camera,
I would have smacked your ass.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.684
The real bitch is out now.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.519
I'm gonna tell Sandy
it's either me or her.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.146
-You are replaceable.
-I know.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.648
There's someone sitting
in quarantine right now

00:23.690 --> 00:24.691
to take your job.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.192
The chef I have in quarantine

00:26.234 --> 00:29.070
doesn't have the CV
that Mathew has.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.114
Sometimes it's better to go
with the devil you know

00:31.156 --> 00:32.490
than the devil you don't know.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.367
She said things to me,
she said things to Mat.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.244
She called me a [bleep].

00:36.286 --> 00:38.371
She told me I should have
been aborted multiple times.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.207
Considering how it's permeated
through the entire boat...

00:41.249 --> 00:43.668
-Mm-hmm.
-I have to let you go.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.545
Delaney is still an option.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.589
I think it's best
it's just me and Courtney.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.132
Like, she's on the ball.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.092
I do not want the client
to feel the impact.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.595
Charter number six.
This'll be a shorter charter.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.597
Anthony Evans and Chris Loar.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.557
Anthony is a gospel artist.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.684
And Reyn is lactose-intolerant.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.606
[gasps]
Dave!

01:04.647 --> 01:07.108
Oh, my God.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.569
Injuries... if any guests
or you guys are injured,

01:09.611 --> 01:12.405
I wanna be the first
to know about it.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.742
Hey, Malia, can you come to the
starboard side of the main deck?

01:15.784 --> 01:17.494
Copy.

01:17.535 --> 01:20.747
-Tell me why you're limping.
-I fell.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.582
Why wasn't it reported to me?

01:22.624 --> 01:25.251
-I'm not a chief officer.
-I don't give a [bleep]!

01:25.293 --> 01:27.504
You should have come to me
that he was hurt!

01:27.545 --> 01:29.589
-I didn't know it was that...
-Stop making excuses, Malia!

01:34.928 --> 01:37.472
-The reality is, Malia...
-It's not an excuse!

01:37.514 --> 01:39.391
I asked you to come to me
in the very first meeting,

01:39.432 --> 01:40.684
and you never did.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.560
So from now on,
I don't give a [bleep]

01:42.602 --> 01:46.272
if he hits his head, anything.
It's a liability, period.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.774
Even if it's a bruise,

01:47.816 --> 01:50.485
it's a massive ----ing
bruise, and I just...

01:50.527 --> 01:51.945
-I didn't know it was...
-I don't... I don't trust you.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.279
-...my responsibility.
-I don't trust you.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.280
-Okay.
-I can't trust you.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.532
Okay.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.453
Mm.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.255
Fingerprints, yeah.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.673
And then we'll get changed.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.927
So, you need to go make
an incident report...

02:17.512 --> 02:18.680
Sure.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.434
No.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.979
I might do a cruditÃ©
meat and cheese,

02:26.021 --> 02:26.980
and skip the fruit plate.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.523
Yeah, no one really touches it.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.817
All right, is this gonna
be an early morning,

02:30.859 --> 02:32.318
early night type of crowd?

02:32.360 --> 02:34.362
I hope it's not a
late, late night,

02:34.404 --> 02:36.573
because I've only got
two stews, you know?

02:36.614 --> 02:38.283
You know what I'm saying?

02:38.324 --> 02:40.952
Before Lady Michelle,
I had seven girls under me.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.329
Now I've got one.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.206
We've just gotta
keep pushin' through.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.334
I'm not disregarding
my gut ever again,

02:47.375 --> 02:49.544
and if this blows up in my face,

02:49.586 --> 02:51.629
then that's on me, and I will
take responsibility for that.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.594
What was it about?

02:57.635 --> 03:00.555
An incident...
like, David's leg.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.309
[bleep]

03:04.351 --> 03:06.227
It happened not
during work hours,

03:06.269 --> 03:07.562
not in a work-related incident.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.356
Yeah.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.399
If he needed to report it,
he should have done it himself.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.651
Deck team cuddle, come on.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.570
Oh, I'm slightly wet, I'm sorry.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.533
-Hey, bro.
-Hey, buddy.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.659
What's going on?

03:21.701 --> 03:23.453
What's the vibe on deck today?

03:23.495 --> 03:25.580
-A bit limpy.
-Limpy Dave?

03:25.622 --> 03:27.374
Yeah, it's all good.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.250
So, can you say a little
prayer that everyone

03:29.292 --> 03:31.336
-likes everything tonight, man?
-They're going to.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.254
Well, we've got a religious
group coming on board,

03:33.296 --> 03:35.507
so we should probably get
with the prayers now.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.467
I feel very lucky I'm here.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.719
I feel like I've escaped
being fired many times.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.888
I'm like Mat the cat...
nine lives.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.306
Think back to the last
five charters...

03:43.348 --> 03:44.849
Yeah?

03:44.891 --> 03:46.017
Where they've loved everything
you've done.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.268
-Yeah.
-It's gonna be fine.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.436
-Yeah?
-Yeah, of course.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.941
<i>Malia, Malia,</i>
<i>please come to the bridge.</i>

03:52.982 --> 03:55.902
Copy.
Ugh.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.571
I don't know the severity
of his injury.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.783
David may feel okay,
but God forbid

04:01.825 --> 04:03.952
in two weeks something happens,
he passes a blood clot.

04:03.993 --> 04:07.038
He has not reported the injury,
so guess who's liable?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.833
The owner.
The vessel. And me.

04:09.874 --> 04:13.461
We're two stewardesses!

04:13.503 --> 04:15.964
I've got a headache, [bleep].

04:16.006 --> 04:17.674
What would be your most
pointless super power?

04:17.716 --> 04:19.426
-Fly.
-Fly?

04:19.467 --> 04:20.677
Yeah, it's...
it's always gonna be flying.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.554
-What about you?
-To read people's minds.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.389
So, I would like
to speak to animals.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.474
But then what if
I found out that animals

04:26.516 --> 04:28.059
are actually thick as sh--,
and I've wasted my power,

04:28.101 --> 04:29.561
and like, all they
just do is, like,

04:29.602 --> 04:31.521
actually they just go, "Meh."

04:31.563 --> 04:33.648
Like, that's actually
what they're saying.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.568
Everyone on this boat has
created such a great environment

04:36.609 --> 04:39.779
for me to be able to share
my thoughts and feelings.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.073
So, it's worrying,
thinking that I'm leaving that

04:42.115 --> 04:44.451
and then maybe having to deal
with other people's

04:44.492 --> 04:47.871
impressions of me
and my lifestyle.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.622
I'm trying to work
out the next job.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.458
I just messaged
my old chief officer.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.792
I'll say, "Oh, do you need
someone to work for the winter."

04:52.834 --> 04:54.544
I'll give him a recommendation.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.464
-I'm...
-Yeah.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.382
-Yeah, lovely.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.969
So, Malia,
I'm obviously upset.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.138
I made it very clear, day one,

05:05.180 --> 05:07.682
if anyone gets injured,
I don't care...

05:07.724 --> 05:10.935
fingers, head, whatever it is,
it's reported.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.479
If David had been working,
slipped and fell...

05:12.520 --> 05:13.688
Yeah.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.023
While working and got
that bruise,

05:15.065 --> 05:16.691
I would have filled out
an incident report.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.652
When the incident happened,
it was after-hours.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.154
You report at work...

05:21.196 --> 05:22.572
Okay, I see where
you're going technically.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.823
-Yeah.
-But here's the deal...

05:23.865 --> 05:25.408
-He's limping.
-And he should...

05:25.450 --> 05:26.743
I get what you're saying,
it could become

05:26.785 --> 05:28.536
-something more serious.
-Yeah.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.537
I'm sorry that that didn't
get communicated to you.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.039
Thank you.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.874
The captain has the right
to know what's going on

05:32.916 --> 05:34.542
with their crew at all times,

05:34.584 --> 05:36.503
especially when
it comes to injuries.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.005
David should have reported it,
I should have reminded him.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.007
At the end of the day,
that's my fault.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.468
-And I'm sorry I yelled at you.
-That's okay.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.053
-Because I have the highest...
-I just, like...

05:45.095 --> 05:48.682
You are... like, for me,
I trust you 1,000 percent.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.600
And when I found out...

05:50.642 --> 05:52.394
Yeah, that really hurt, for
you to say you don't trust me.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.688
-Yeah, I know, I trust you.
-That hurt me to the core.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.064
That's fair. I get it.
I'm sorry.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.566
I'm sorry.
I'll make sure it happens.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.402
Okay. Thanks, Malia.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.867
[yawns]

06:07.909 --> 06:09.160
Hi, this is Sandy.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.080
Hi!

06:20.130 --> 06:22.048
Oh, okay.
Okay, got it.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.842
All right, well,
thank you for the heads up.

06:23.883 --> 06:24.926
-All right, bye-bye.
-Bye-bye!

06:26.761 --> 06:28.138
...but now I'm
gonna have to redo it.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.181
Think you're gonna be
out for the count.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.768
It's gonna be Mzi mornings,
Dave lates.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.146
So, I'm gonna put Dave
kind of at the night shift,

06:36.187 --> 06:38.898
where he won't be doing
as much physical labor.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.067
As long as you can
stand and wash dishes...

06:41.109 --> 06:43.153
I can certainly do that.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.488
Lloyd and Mzi will
now just kinda have

06:45.530 --> 06:47.115
to step up their game
during the day.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.950
Hopefully Captain Sandy
can see

06:48.992 --> 06:51.036
I'm trying to remedy
the situation.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.248
All crew, all crew,
please get into your whites

06:55.290 --> 06:57.625
and let's meet on the
dock in five minutes.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.755
And just so you know,
we have three charter guests

07:01.796 --> 07:04.591
that are gonna be late because
of their COVID test is late.

07:04.632 --> 07:05.800
Okay.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.182
Oh, can you get me a couple
of the orchid flowers?

07:12.223 --> 07:13.725
-Are they downstairs?
-No, they're right here.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.768
Plates...

07:17.103 --> 07:19.272
Charter number six.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.108
Pull cutlery,
plates, placemats...

07:22.150 --> 07:23.485
-Yeah.
-Napkins.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.486
Okay, are we doing
welcome snacks?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.612
Yeah.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.780
Yeah, he's got some ready, so...

07:26.821 --> 07:27.822
I just need, like,
three minutes.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.783
-Whew!
-Let's go!

07:29.824 --> 07:30.992
-Hey, hey!
-Hi!

07:31.034 --> 07:32.786
Hey! I'm Anthony.
Good to see you.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.287
-Captain, nice to meet you.
-Hi, welcome.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.623
-Hi, Anthony, sorry.
-Katie.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.749
-Hi, I'm Mat.
-Hey, Mat.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.084
Katie, nice to meet you, Reyn.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.794
Anthony, good to
meet you, David.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.962
-So nice to have you.
-Thank you.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.631
So, Katie's gonna show
you around the vessel.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.840
So, just head onto the boat.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.008
Sounds great.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.304
Thank you.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.931
Okay, great.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.265
Should we do a tour of the boat?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.768
Thank you.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.061
This is our sundeck.

07:58.103 --> 08:01.147
We have a big-ass
Jacuzzi right here.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.024
It's awesome.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.698
Lloyd, no Christmas songs.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.700
This is the sundeck aft.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.243
Ooh, I love this.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.330
Why?

08:17.372 --> 08:18.957
There's so much pressure now.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.000
I can't remember what
she just asked me to do.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.002
Good start.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.754
As a stewardess, the smallest
boat I worked on before this

08:24.796 --> 08:27.132
was a 60-meter, and
there was five of us.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.676
I can't believe that we're about
to do this trip with two stews.

08:29.718 --> 08:32.053
Like, anxiety is real.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.556
Okay, comin' in.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.349
Then we come through
to the primary cabin.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.727
Ooh!
Beautiful.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.564
So in here, we've got
his and hers bathrooms.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.606
Cheers.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.860
-Are you ready?
-Yep.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.153
-You're gonna be on the bow.
-By myself?

08:48.194 --> 08:49.195
All you're doing
is pulling the lines in.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.864
Yeah.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.240
They're gonna undo it,
pull, pull, pull.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.038
I do feel now that
I can actually do that

08:58.079 --> 09:01.124
by myself without having
somebody watching me.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.128
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.590
So, port will come in
first, then starboard.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.632
You got it.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.596
I should have waited on y'all.
My impatient self.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.306
Can I get you anything
to drink at all?

09:16.348 --> 09:18.016
I have a childish thing
about me.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.060
I like Sprite with grenadine...

09:20.101 --> 09:21.644
it's a Shirley Temple, but I
just say Sprite with grenadine.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.063
-Sure.
-It makes... you know.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.898
-It makes you feel adult.
-Cool... yeah, yeah.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.149
He doesn't drink, and hey,
if that's what he wants,

09:26.191 --> 09:27.692
that's what he'll get.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.235
I'll grab you some
plates and stuff,

09:29.277 --> 09:30.904
-and then I'll go grab you that.
-Thank you.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.906
It's just exactly
what we needed right now,

09:32.947 --> 09:34.616
especially for me and Courtney.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.910
Mzi, you could just let
go of the port one first.

09:36.951 --> 09:37.952
<i>Copy that.</i>

09:39.954 --> 09:40.955
<i>Port bow line coming in first.</i>

09:42.791 --> 09:44.668
<i>Malia, you can</i>
<i>free up the lines.</i>

09:44.709 --> 09:46.836
Copy, freeing up
the stern lines.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.172
All right, Dave, yours first.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.924
<i>Port bow line is on board.</i>

09:50.965 --> 09:53.635
That is all stern lines on
board, all stern lines on board.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.889
Whoa, what's going on there?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.350
Captain Sandy, you're close
to the port side dolphin.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.770
Yeah, pretty freaky.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.980
Captain Sandy, you're very
close to the dolphin.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.440
-[bleep]
-Get a fender ready.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.651
Oh, God!

10:09.693 --> 10:11.319
[bleep]

10:11.361 --> 10:13.279
-Coming up...
-I'm freaking out.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.823
Can you just say
a little prayer

10:14.864 --> 10:16.157
that they love
everything tonight?

10:16.199 --> 10:17.951
I'm not a ----ing mother.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.458
Whoa... Captain Sandy, you're
very close to the dolphin.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.461
-[bleep]
-Get a fender ready.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.463
Oh, God!

10:31.923 --> 10:33.258
Lady Michelle's
a very heavy vessel.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.052
When you have 909 gross tons
in the water

10:36.094 --> 10:37.345
with two different currents,

10:37.387 --> 10:39.514
and the wind matching one
of the currents,

10:39.556 --> 10:42.183
it's very difficult
to get out of that hole.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.019
And I overcorrect to starboard,

10:44.060 --> 10:48.189
I need to bring it back to port,
so it pushes the stern over.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.358
So now, as I come out,

10:50.400 --> 10:54.237
I'm overcorrecting, my stern
could hit that port dolphin.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.740
-Ooh.
-Whew.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.867
<i>Clearing both dolphins</i>
<i>off your stern.</i>

10:58.908 --> 11:00.118
So sweet.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.870
Filtered water for the rice.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.456
Clear of all traffic, all clear.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.874
Thank you very much.

11:05.915 --> 11:06.875
Insane.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.293
This could be heaven.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.961
Nicely done, guys.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.130
-Nice work, Mzi.
-Thank you.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.381
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.050
Ow!

11:15.091 --> 11:16.968
Can I get you gentlemen
another drink?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.054
-I'll do gin and tonic.
-Tequila soda.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.889
-Perfect.
-You're, like, the queen?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.891
-The queen?
-Of the...

11:22.932 --> 11:23.892
-Of interior.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.310
I'll take it!

11:29.481 --> 11:31.024
Deck crew, deck crew, Katie.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.400
Can you please clean
the crew mess?

11:32.442 --> 11:34.527
<i>Copy.</i>
<i>David, help interior.</i>

11:34.569 --> 11:35.779
Copy.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.406
-...and tequila.
-Thank you.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.453
Okay.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.997
I'm going to get changed.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.916
You have to help me just
move this over onto that.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.834
-Shirley Temples?
-Shirley Temples.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.169
Shirley Temples.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.253
We go to restaurants and
we order like children,

11:52.295 --> 11:53.505
everybody gets a Shirley Temple.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.964
Hey, if it tastes good.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.301
Hey, hey.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.844
So, do you wanna turn
laundry and sh--...

11:59.886 --> 12:02.055
-Yeah.
-And I'll just holler at you.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.978
Here's our deck schedule
for this charter.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.440
I moved David to nights
because I don't want him

12:12.482 --> 12:14.192
during the afternoons,

12:14.234 --> 12:16.611
when we have a very heavy
water sports charter.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.487
Thank you.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.201
-This is awesome.
-Having a God moment.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.120
What's going on?

12:25.161 --> 12:26.246
Not much, we're about
30 minutes from the anchorage.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.039
Okay.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.626
So, this is your afternoon,
lucky you... your beach access.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.129
Malia's gonna scout it,
picnic area's up here.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.047
-Up that hill.
-Okay.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.467
And we don't know how long
the walk is up to the picnic?

12:39.509 --> 12:40.885
Twenty minutes.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.929
-For setup, two deck crew.
-Yeah.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.139
Unless I take one of you,

12:44.180 --> 12:46.016
but then that leaves
just one of you.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.560
-David?
-No.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.479
-Oh, yeah.
-It'll probably be...

12:51.521 --> 12:53.064
Okay.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.358
This is where Delaney
actually would help.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.321
Sometimes just having
extra hands is extra hands.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.366
I'm just thinking of not to
pack too much stuff, you know?

13:03.408 --> 13:07.203
It's just unnecessary
stress on the deck crew.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.080
-We're a team here.
-Yah.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.332
Hi, lads.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.459
How's everything on
the boat so far?

13:12.500 --> 13:13.585
-It's amazing, man.
-Great!

13:16.546 --> 13:18.173
In the park, oh, okay.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.221
Do you want me to drop
and you pull?

13:25.263 --> 13:27.307
-Yeah.
-You can drop the anchor.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.977
<i>We're gonna do five</i>
<i>in the water.</i>

13:33.688 --> 13:35.357
That is five shackles
at the waterline

13:35.398 --> 13:36.649
Thank you.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.569
Someone wanna do
a deck check, please?

13:39.611 --> 13:41.529
I'll just leave them here,

13:41.571 --> 13:42.989
and when you go across you can
take them so they don't get...

13:43.031 --> 13:45.367
-Yeah.
-Ugh!

13:45.408 --> 13:48.203
I work better under,
like, physical pressure.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.371
I've always been like that.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.247
It's just I'm better at my job

13:51.289 --> 13:54.000
when I'm running around
like a headless chicken.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.960
That might be the water taxi.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.213
We could maybe put some in their
napkins or something like that.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.714
Yeah.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.633
I would take physical stress
over emotional stress

14:01.675 --> 14:03.468
any day of my life.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.596
Interior, interior, the other
guests might be approaching.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.639
Courtney, Courtney.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.313
Dre!

14:15.355 --> 14:16.398
Probably not
the appropriate shoes

14:16.439 --> 14:17.941
for getting on a moving...

14:17.982 --> 14:19.442
No, no, I feel like my
shoe's too high!

14:19.484 --> 14:20.527
Welcome on board.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.278
Thank you, I'm Holly.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.446
Hi, Holly, I'm Courtney,
nice to meet you.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.073
Hi, Courtney, nice
to meet you too.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.282
-Here's your refreshing towel.
-Thank you!

14:26.324 --> 14:30.120
-Lechelle, nice to meet you.
-[bleep]

14:30.161 --> 14:31.287
-Okay, cheers.
-Cheers!

14:32.789 --> 14:34.416
Deck crew, deck crew,
if anyone's available

14:34.457 --> 14:36.710
to grab towels down in laundry,
that would be amazing.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.253
Yeah, I'm free, Court.
Come up.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.005
All right, you got the bow?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.465
Lloyd, we've got the whips
and the transom.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.093
That is the song of my people.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.261
Ah, me too.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.595
[whistling]

14:47.637 --> 14:49.389
It's frustrating for me.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.349
Like, I hate that I won't be
as effective on deck.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.101
I know it's my fault and

14:53.143 --> 14:56.271
I've never felt more useless
and just ----ing...

14:56.312 --> 14:57.772
just sh--.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.274
-Get up here!
-Whoa!

14:59.315 --> 15:01.026
Guys, this is my Jack
and Rose moment!

15:01.067 --> 15:02.485
Oh, this is crazy.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.612
Very special day.
This is our vision.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.489
All righty, let's do this.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.288
Oh!

15:13.329 --> 15:14.998
-Mzi!
-Oh, no!

15:15.040 --> 15:17.542
Sorry we all happened
to be watching.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.169
Are you okay?
What just happened?

15:19.210 --> 15:20.545
How long do I have?

15:24.716 --> 15:25.675
[bleep] me.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.635
Its gonna be fun.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.388
I feel the vibe
has been way better

15:30.430 --> 15:31.765
and more chill without Lexi.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.433
It's just a big sigh of relief.

15:33.475 --> 15:36.353
Like, my spiral has
kind of subsided.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.315
Eee!

15:40.357 --> 15:42.317
Our side's good.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.652
-What up?
-[bleep] me! Sh--!

15:44.694 --> 15:46.321
[laughs]

15:49.199 --> 15:50.658
-Just one?
-That's it.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.161
All crew, all crew,
that is tender away.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.163
That leaves you
with Lloyd on deck.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.374
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.626
This beach picnic site
is beautiful.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.504
It's on top of the mountain,
it's overlooking the water.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.714
There's remnants of,
like, an old movie set.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.424
That's one benefit to the Med,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.802
is you're picnic sites
are usually, like,

16:08.843 --> 16:11.596
castles or old ruins
compared to just,

16:11.638 --> 16:13.223
you know, a white sand beach.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.267
All right, here we go.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.605
Where are we setting it up?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.357
Up there, I think.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.525
Lovely.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.070
This is cool, right?

16:27.112 --> 16:28.196
-It is great.
-Oh, wow.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.531
It's an old movie set.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.116
You're gonna have
a really nice day.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.118
What are we walking over?
Sounds like glass.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.619
Oh, did you invite
Sandy to dinner?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.204
-I didn't.
-Are you able to join us?

16:36.246 --> 16:37.372
-I can, yes, of course.
-Oh, good.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.415
Okay, perfect.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.583
-[bleep] Is that a path?
-No.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.085
I don't think there's a path.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.420
You've gotta be
----ing kidding me.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.714
Okay.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.674
-Oh, my God, my arms are dead.
-My back!

16:47.716 --> 16:50.552
Two of us can...
no, no, there's no way.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.138
I don't wanna be a dick, but we
need an extra person right now.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.766
-Yeah.
-Holy f.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.561
Mathew, I'm having dinner
with them tonight.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.771
You are?
Italian feast.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.314
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.443
I've worked for billionaires
and celebrities,

17:06.484 --> 17:08.570
but none of them have
seen me have meltdowns

17:08.611 --> 17:11.197
like Sandy has and
still kept me employed.

17:11.239 --> 17:14.784
So, I feel I have
more to prove to Sandy

17:14.826 --> 17:15.910
than I do to the guests.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.163
Oh, holy sh--.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.293
You gotta be ----ing kidding me.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.796
Ow!

17:26.838 --> 17:29.424
All right, Mzi, I'll set up.
You just go get the rest.

17:29.466 --> 17:32.260
We'll be back another
four times.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.637
-Coming up...
-Ah!

17:36.765 --> 17:38.767
They went under that bridge?
Go get them.

17:38.808 --> 17:39.809
Guys!

17:48.943 --> 17:50.195
So, I don't need to be
packed up till 2:00, right?

17:51.363 --> 17:52.781
Maybe just before.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.325
-Are you pumped up?
-I ----ing hate a beach picnic.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.368
Let's double-time it.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.827
Hey, wait, wait, wait...

17:57.869 --> 18:00.330
Don't leave me,
Mathew's often alone.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.332
I've got sh-- to do, Mathew.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.709
All right, super-mega-prep time.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.336
Wow, look at this.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.754
My arm hurts.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.507
-And that's all the ironing?
-Yas, queen.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.634
Do you wanna sit down for, like,
half an hour or whatever?

18:12.676 --> 18:13.927
Amazeballs.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.931
Oh, my God, this
is way too heavy.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.517
I think I get
why people have these.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.310
I was having a God moment.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.440
[laughing]

18:29.943 --> 18:31.611
Wine glass to the left,
water to the right.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.530
Oh [bleep] it doesn't matter,
we need to go.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.698
Like, seriously.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.658
Just feeling blessed
in this moment.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.909
Are you doing a shot of tequila?

18:37.951 --> 18:39.786
-Would you like one?
-All right.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.705
Do you guys want me to
take a bottle of this over?

18:41.746 --> 18:43.039
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.000
Bridge, bridge, that
is tender returning.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.335
All right, Katie,
Malia's on her way back.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.546
-Copy.
-To an amazing trip.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.672
Here we go.

18:52.507 --> 18:55.385
Yo, how does it feel to be
the world's best chief stew?

18:55.427 --> 18:56.678
Yeah.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.806
Oh, what have I missed?

18:59.848 --> 19:01.016
These guys have been
hiking up a mountain.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.726
Like, four times.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.060
All the plates and containers
and stuff are in there?

19:04.102 --> 19:05.812
Yeah.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.397
Just be careful with those
three things on the bottom.

19:07.439 --> 19:11.067
So, have you here, and us
three go up there,

19:11.109 --> 19:12.902
and you pack away as much
as you can by yourself.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.612
-Sure.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.492
Bye!

19:23.538 --> 19:25.749
You've gotta help them
set up, come back down.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.751
Katie and
I will bring the guests.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.044
You'll be standing
here when they come in,

19:29.085 --> 19:30.462
-ready to grab lines.
-Cool.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.422
Hasta luego.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.466
<i>Bridge, bridge,</i>
<i>that's tender returning.</i>

19:34.507 --> 19:36.468
-Nice work.
-Copy that.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.719
I'm gonna go
round up the guests.

19:37.761 --> 19:38.720
Are we going right now?

19:38.762 --> 19:40.347
Whenever you guys are ready.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.389
-I'm coming with you guys now.
-Oh, wow!

19:41.431 --> 19:42.599
-Are you ready?
-Yes, yes!

19:42.640 --> 19:44.434
Ready to roll.
How was your hiking?

19:44.476 --> 19:46.311
So good.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.604
-Daddy!
-Yeah.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.439
-Are we there yet?
-Yeah.

19:49.481 --> 19:50.940
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

19:50.982 --> 19:51.941
Everyone's got walking shoes?

19:51.983 --> 19:53.568
These are prawns.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.778
We can't get these
out until the very end.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.863
Bridge, bridge,
that is tender away

19:56.905 --> 19:59.616
-with all guests and two crew.
-Copy.

19:59.657 --> 20:00.867
It's so pretty!

20:04.621 --> 20:06.331
Thanks.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.083
It is a bit of a hike,
but it's amazing up there.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.502
Man, I'm so grateful that they
took all this stuff up here.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.503
-Wow.
-Wow!

20:11.544 --> 20:13.004
Spectacular.

20:14.589 --> 20:17.384
Ooh!
All right.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.010
Yeah, I've done a few
inspections in my time.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.389
Back to the grind.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.849
So, for lunch we've got
build-your-own poke bowls.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.726
-God is everything!
-Cheers.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.478
Because of Him, like...

20:28.520 --> 20:30.438
-Ladies, you're gonna start us.
-That was very nice.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.816
I mean, you got 10 seconds.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.360
-Man, I'm hungry.
-This is crazy, man.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.820
Exquisite.
All my favorite things.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.905
Wow, it's amazing.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.031
It's not even cold.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.866
-So good!
-I'm excited.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.993
-I mean, really...
-Mm, mm-hmm.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.954
David, we're gonna go
pick up the guests.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.664
If we can get the chocks
ready for the tender?

20:47.706 --> 20:49.165
Bring the tender around?

20:49.207 --> 20:50.667
Oh, yeah, because then we
can pull the whips in.

20:50.709 --> 20:51.668
Yeah, that'd be great,
thank you.

20:51.710 --> 20:52.836
Do you need me to...

20:52.877 --> 20:54.504
-Naw, I'm fine.
-Yeah, sweet.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.172
-Got garbage?
-I took my garbage, buddy.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.424
Oh!

20:57.465 --> 21:00.468
I know, first time!

21:04.014 --> 21:05.390
Oh!

21:07.684 --> 21:09.102
I'm a big girl.

21:10.729 --> 21:12.605
Does Mat know how
much we love him?

21:12.647 --> 21:15.567
Welcome to the magunga!

21:15.608 --> 21:17.610
-What's next?
-I'm gonna be on that jet board.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.696
-How are you?
-Yeah, good, how are you?

21:19.738 --> 21:21.740
-Just tired.
-Same.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.494
Um...

21:26.536 --> 21:27.996
No matter what's going on,

21:28.038 --> 21:29.622
I would definitely consider
Mzi a friend for life.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.833
I feel like the flowers kind
of made me realize

21:31.875 --> 21:33.877
that I don't want anything more
than a friendship and stuff.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.128
To be honest, I am, like,
a bit scared

21:35.170 --> 21:36.880
of ever getting
into a relationship.

21:36.921 --> 21:39.049
My ex dumped me whilst
we were locked down together,

21:39.090 --> 21:40.884
and if that wasn't bad enough,

21:40.925 --> 21:42.677
we were literally in the middle
of watching "Ozark" together.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.055
So, I could never finish it, and
it completely ruined it for me.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.184
-Your day is just hectic.
-What?

21:49.225 --> 21:50.185
Your day is just hectic.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.644
Yeah, bru.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.897
<i>Lady Michelle,</i>
<i>guests are ready.</i>

21:53.938 --> 21:55.440
Can you send
the tender over, please?

21:55.482 --> 21:56.649
Copy that.

21:56.691 --> 21:57.901
Did you want more champagne?

21:57.942 --> 21:59.152
You are taking good care of us.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.737
One, two...

22:02.238 --> 22:04.908
All right, let's do this.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.618
Bridge, bridge
that is tender away

22:06.659 --> 22:09.120
-to go pick up all the guests.
-Thanks.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.955
We would have liked
to stay, like, all day.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.625
It's a beautiful view,
isn't it?

22:13.667 --> 22:14.959
Yeah, that was amazing!

22:16.670 --> 22:19.089
This boat moment is my moment.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.678
Captain Sandy!
Hey, Cap!

22:24.719 --> 22:26.012
Your team pulled it off, wow.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.055
Amazing. Amazing.

22:27.097 --> 22:28.473
Best charter ever.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.766
Let's do a picture
of this, ready?

22:29.808 --> 22:32.060
Oh not this side.
My good side.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.188
Candid, keep taking... ready?

22:35.230 --> 22:39.025
-Candid laughter.
-Ooh.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.153
Woo, we got married, bitches!

22:42.195 --> 22:43.238
How was your lunch?

22:43.279 --> 22:45.240
Perfect... simple, elegant.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.117
See you at dinner.

22:47.158 --> 22:51.037
Bridge, bridge, that's tender
away to go pick up our crew.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.163
Roger-dodger.

22:54.833 --> 22:55.959
Is this the last of the stuff?

22:56.001 --> 22:57.961
-Yeah.
-Ugh.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.963
All right, let's [bleep]
this puppy.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.506
Hi, guys.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.133
[bleep]

23:03.174 --> 23:04.968
Katie, lege!

23:05.010 --> 23:06.594
Team effort, you know?

23:06.636 --> 23:09.723
<i>Bridge, bridge,</i>
<i>that is tender returning.</i>

23:13.685 --> 23:16.187
Ugh, I feel, like,

23:16.229 --> 23:18.815
exhaust, like, so...
"exhaust?"

23:18.857 --> 23:20.984
Exhausted.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.610
Do you want any drinks
or anything?

23:22.652 --> 23:23.945
Did you get rest,
a good nap?

23:23.987 --> 23:25.655
No, but I will at some point.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.158
Ugh!

23:28.199 --> 23:30.035
Oh, I can't even imagine
two people doing that job.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.828
Honestly, I know,
it's been crazy.

23:31.870 --> 23:32.871
Yeah.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.664
Okay, guys. Epic.

23:34.706 --> 23:36.666
We're just trying to get used
it, like, the two of us.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.209
-Thanks, team!
-Yah.

23:38.251 --> 23:39.669
-I'll have a margarita.
-Okay, that... two?

23:39.711 --> 23:40.837
Yep, perfect.

23:40.879 --> 23:43.173
-They were happy?
-Yeah, loved it.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.549
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.552
I can only imagine.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.721
I think I'm going swimsuit
before the sun goes down.

23:49.763 --> 23:50.764
Yes, we gotta get in the water.

23:50.805 --> 23:51.890
I'm on it, let's go.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.601
-Wassup?
-What do you guys wanna do?

23:54.642 --> 23:55.977
I wanna jet-ski for a second.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.062
Okay.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.564
It looks cold to me.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.567
Okay, guys, just the rules
in Croatia for the jet-skis.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.070
You do have to stay
300 meters offshore,

24:05.111 --> 24:08.698
so no zipping in close
to shore at all.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.117
-Okay, cool?
-Cool.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.370
-Yeah!
-Ah!

24:13.411 --> 24:15.663
[bleep]

24:19.417 --> 24:21.002
Yes!

24:21.044 --> 24:22.087
That's fun.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.215
Oh! Nice!

24:25.256 --> 24:26.675
I like them,
they're really funny.

24:26.716 --> 24:27.801
Yeah, they are.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.094
Where are they going?

24:30.095 --> 24:31.179
I think...

24:32.847 --> 24:34.641
That's the last direction
I saw them going.

24:34.683 --> 24:37.769
I'm gonna go to the bridge
and get eyes on those jet-skis.

24:37.811 --> 24:40.105
Two skis have just
booted straight into town.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.898
I came up here to
get eyes on the jet-skis,

24:41.940 --> 24:43.733
because they just
went into town.

24:43.775 --> 24:45.735
They went under that bridge?

24:45.777 --> 24:47.153
-Go get them!
-Yep.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.824
Bridge, bridge,
that is tender away.

24:50.865 --> 24:51.950
We're gonna get a ticket.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.911
Okay, I don't see them at all.

25:03.920 --> 25:04.170
Guys!

25:05.839 --> 25:07.340
----ing idiots!

25:09.843 --> 25:10.844
What's going on, chica?

25:10.885 --> 25:12.178
Yeah, twins done.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.805
Cool, do you wanna
just smash out laund?

25:13.847 --> 25:15.306
Yeah, just call me
if you need me, okay?

25:15.348 --> 25:17.809
<i>Roger-dodger.</i>

25:17.851 --> 25:19.894
Did you say, like,
300 yards from the yacht?

25:19.936 --> 25:22.313
300 meters from shore.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.732
Oh we went
go through there.

25:23.773 --> 25:24.983
Yeah, you're well
within it, yeah.

25:25.025 --> 25:28.069
-Sorry.
-Bad boys.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.946
Just head that way.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.325
Bridge, that is
jet-skis returning.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.162
Yeah, read you loud and clear,
they're off our stern now.

25:45.795 --> 25:48.340
Wow, look at this,
it's so good!

25:48.381 --> 25:50.133
-How was it?
-It was amazing.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.344
I think we got in
trouble, though.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.928
Pumped and ready to go.

25:53.970 --> 25:56.097
Do either of you wanna
go take a little break?

25:56.139 --> 25:58.099
-Yeah, I'll do 15 and then...
-Yeah?

25:58.141 --> 25:59.726
Then I'll go off-duty.

26:01.519 --> 26:04.064
-[bleep]
-Woo!

26:04.105 --> 26:06.358
-If you wanna jump, you can.
-Whoa!

26:06.399 --> 26:09.194
-Man!
-Whoa!

26:09.235 --> 26:11.029
Four guests in the water,
now swimming back.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.947
Copy, four, understood.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.366
I'm here, let's
have a discussion.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.492
Yeah, please.

26:15.533 --> 26:16.910
How many courses are we doing?

26:16.951 --> 26:18.119
Three.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.496
Cutlery...
so what are we doing?

26:19.537 --> 26:21.373
Burrata, so knife and fork.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.208
Bread basket for the thing.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.876
Focaccia, so we want
bread plates.

26:24.918 --> 26:25.919
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.504
And... wait, wait, wait,

26:27.545 --> 26:28.797
can we chat about one more
thing before you abandon me,

26:28.838 --> 26:30.215
-like always?
-Okay, tell me.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.217
I'm doing, like, a
three-hour bolognese.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.010
Should I mix some onion in it?

26:34.052 --> 26:35.053
I don't know.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.055
What would Jesus do?

26:37.097 --> 26:39.391
I actually enjoy
working with Mathew.

26:39.432 --> 26:42.060
It's nice that he
does ask my opinion,

26:42.102 --> 26:45.105
but also at the same time
I'm a stew down.

26:45.146 --> 26:48.942
I got a ----ing 55-meter boat
to run with myself and Courtney.

26:48.983 --> 26:50.527
I just need you to do your job,

26:50.568 --> 26:51.820
and you're just gonna
have to make these decisions

26:51.861 --> 26:53.071
on your own right now.

26:53.113 --> 26:55.031
You wanna do parmesan
on the table,

26:55.073 --> 26:57.909
or should I just parmesan
everyone's pasta except for his?

26:57.951 --> 26:59.411
Parmesan pasta except for hers.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.079
All right.

27:01.121 --> 27:02.497
You guys headed up
to the Jacuzzi?

27:02.539 --> 27:03.998
Yes!

27:04.040 --> 27:06.418
<i>Katie, Katie, Mzi,</i>
<i>to the hot tub.</i>

27:06.459 --> 27:08.294
<i>Hot tub, okay, Mzi.</i>

27:08.336 --> 27:11.006
Lloyd, all guests done
with the slide.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.424
Go ahead and start
packing it down.

27:12.465 --> 27:13.550
Copy.

27:15.343 --> 27:16.803
I'm just gonna get
something to eat, quickly.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.096
Yeah, take a little break.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.431
I brought some little snacks.

27:19.472 --> 27:20.890
Ooh!

27:21.891 --> 27:23.810
Woohoo!

27:23.852 --> 27:26.938
Do you guys know what time
you want dinner, roughly?

27:26.980 --> 27:28.273
I'll let Mat know.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.482
[yawns]

27:32.193 --> 27:33.278
8:30 dinner.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.030
-Oh, my God.
-I know, right?

27:35.071 --> 27:37.449
I have so much to do,
I'm freaking out.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.409
Can you just say
a little prayer

27:39.451 --> 27:40.577
that they love
everything tonight?

27:42.078 --> 27:44.539
That Captain Sandy
loves everything?

27:44.581 --> 27:46.875
I've always been
a sensitive person

27:46.916 --> 27:49.127
who drives off of compliments.

27:49.169 --> 27:51.296
It's literally
generational, almost.

27:51.338 --> 27:54.466
My dad is a stage actor,
my mom's a chef.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.217
I come from an artist family,

27:56.259 --> 27:59.554
and I work better off
of positive reinforcement.

27:59.596 --> 28:02.015
I'm gonna be stressed.
What else is new, eh?

28:04.142 --> 28:05.143
Thank you.

28:06.978 --> 28:09.522
So, we're trying to
be on top on interior?

28:09.564 --> 28:11.316
So far, we're sweet.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.151
When are you guys
gonna take a break?

28:13.193 --> 28:15.028
We're not.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.325
-No, no!
-No? Okay.

28:20.367 --> 28:22.327
I work all...
around this whole thing.

28:22.369 --> 28:23.953
All right, cool.

28:26.247 --> 28:29.584
Well, I've been in Europe for
six weeks, and then came back...

28:29.626 --> 28:31.002
For... just for...

28:31.044 --> 28:32.879
-Just for sh--s and gigs, yeah.
-Okay.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.341
Look at you, looking sharp!
How was your rest?

28:36.383 --> 28:37.384
Oh, it was good, thank you.

28:39.594 --> 28:41.346
-Oh, you did it properly.
-Yeah.

28:41.388 --> 28:42.347
That's how you're meant
to do New Zealand.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.933
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:44.974 --> 28:47.102
It's all... and yeah, Kaikoura,
the amazing coastline.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.228
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, that's stunning.

28:49.562 --> 28:50.689
-So...
-Yeah, you've done it all.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.357
-Yeah, we... yeah.
-Well done.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.109
Harmless flirting, you know?

28:54.150 --> 28:56.027
I've got nothing else going
on right now, you know?

28:56.069 --> 28:57.112
I'll take it.

28:57.153 --> 28:58.488
Did you want another drink?

28:58.530 --> 29:00.031
No rush, I'm just...
I'm hanging

29:00.073 --> 29:01.991
We need to start packing
all the jet-skis,

29:02.033 --> 29:03.576
and Captain Sandy wants
the tender in tonight.

29:03.618 --> 29:05.370
Where's the slide at?
It's completely deflated?

29:05.412 --> 29:06.538
Yeah.

29:06.579 --> 29:07.622
How do you feel
about jumping in?

29:07.664 --> 29:08.665
Yeah, okay.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.336
Woo!

29:16.381 --> 29:18.091
All right, coming up.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.053
All right.

29:22.095 --> 29:23.430
I'm so hungry!

29:24.973 --> 29:27.225
Coming in.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.435
Would you like a
drink or anything?

29:30.020 --> 29:31.271
Yeah.

29:32.355 --> 29:33.606
Hi.

29:33.648 --> 29:35.108
Do you wanna finish
with the cutlery?

29:35.150 --> 29:36.568
All right, let's go
get some food.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.403
-Roger.
-B-R-B.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.410
Always on the run.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.328
[bleep] me.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.585
Good idea, Coco, I like it.

29:53.626 --> 29:54.711
Thanks, Katie.

29:58.423 --> 30:01.468
When Courtney first came on,
one of her biggest things is,

30:01.509 --> 30:04.262
you know, like, yes, she ----ing
rocks at laundry,

30:04.304 --> 30:05.680
she can smash a cabin out,

30:05.722 --> 30:08.266
but she just wasn't
confident in service.

30:08.308 --> 30:11.269
So, I think being thrown
in the deep end

30:11.311 --> 30:12.479
is the best way to learn.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.106
She's definitely
improved so much.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.608
She's just getting
the confidence that

30:16.649 --> 30:18.777
she's always had
deep down inside.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.320
Just wasn't really, like,

30:20.362 --> 30:22.030
presented the opportunity
to do so.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.325
Okay, Coco, we're nearly there.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.374
I like it.
Okay, tablecloth.

30:35.502 --> 30:37.087
Excited!

30:38.630 --> 30:41.007
Yeah, hi, Dad, how's it going?

30:43.343 --> 30:45.136
I'm just trying to redo my CV,

30:45.178 --> 30:47.097
but I haven't got it
as a Word document.

30:47.138 --> 30:49.641
It's always a big risk,
recommending someone for a job,

30:49.683 --> 30:52.018
and it's nice
that David has thought of me

30:52.060 --> 30:53.520
when he's thought of this job.

30:53.561 --> 30:55.230
I don't think I'm gonna
find this many people

30:55.271 --> 30:57.524
on one boat that are
as good as this crew,

30:57.565 --> 30:58.817
but I'm sure there's
a boat out there

30:58.858 --> 31:00.652
that I can feel this happy on.

31:00.694 --> 31:03.113
Can you have a look on
your computer to see whether

31:03.154 --> 31:05.031
or not you've got it as a .doc?

31:05.073 --> 31:06.533
Yeah, yeah, working on it.

31:08.159 --> 31:10.161
Sweet, and yeah,
I'll speak to you later on.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.831
-Dinner's at 8:15?
-Yeah.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.125
Okay, we need to get one
more chair for capitano.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.584
How beautiful!

31:16.626 --> 31:18.253
The red lipstick looks great.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.838
We're in Italy!

31:19.879 --> 31:21.464
You think you're gonna sustain
without a third one?

31:21.506 --> 31:23.216
-Yeah, I think so.
-Feels right.

31:23.258 --> 31:24.843
Okay.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.302
-Hey!
-Hey!

31:26.344 --> 31:27.303
-Hi.
-Yeah!

31:27.345 --> 31:28.763
I'm freaking out.

31:28.805 --> 31:30.473
Of course, I always wanna
make the guests happy,

31:30.515 --> 31:32.851
but now I've been given
a third chance from Sandy,

31:32.892 --> 31:35.228
so I just wanna make her
happy and impress her.

31:35.270 --> 31:37.147
So, the stress levels are up.

31:37.188 --> 31:40.442
-Hey, how you doing?
-We're ready!

31:40.483 --> 31:42.402
I just want it to be
over with, Mzi.

31:44.195 --> 31:45.530
Coming up...

31:45.572 --> 31:49.284
-You need to hustle.
-Come on, Mzi, quick.

31:49.325 --> 31:50.326
Ah! [bleep]

31:50.368 --> 31:51.745
Okay, we can put this one on.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.455
Bump ahead, bump ahead.

32:02.297 --> 32:02.881
I've never served her.

32:04.215 --> 32:05.759
I'm freaking out.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.427
[bleep] my life.

32:07.469 --> 32:08.720
Oh, I just want it
to be over with.

32:08.762 --> 32:11.598
-Hey!
-Hey!

32:11.639 --> 32:13.516
The boss.

32:13.558 --> 32:15.352
It's been a great charter.
You've had the best weather.

32:15.393 --> 32:16.394
-It's been so good.
-That's what we've heard.

32:16.436 --> 32:17.937
I think the best adventures.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.606
It's my first dinner, you know?

32:19.647 --> 32:20.857
-Oh, really?
-Is it?

32:20.899 --> 32:23.610
-What?
-Yeah, I'm very excited.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.653
-That's Reyn's.
-He's lactose-intolerant.

32:28.823 --> 32:30.283
-Ah!
-I hope I'm not hurting you.

32:30.325 --> 32:31.409
Come on!

32:31.451 --> 32:32.952
She's my honorary third stew.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.829
-Captain Sandy!
-Cheers to Captain Sandy!

32:34.871 --> 32:36.164
To Captain Sandy.

32:42.837 --> 32:46.299
Oh, believe me,
I'm so nervous right now.

32:46.341 --> 32:47.884
So, for your first course
tonight you have

32:47.926 --> 32:50.804
a classic Italian burrata
salad with a balsamic glaze.

32:50.845 --> 32:51.888
-Ah!
-Thank you.

32:51.930 --> 32:53.473
Enjoy.

32:54.641 --> 32:55.725
From the school of hard...

32:57.018 --> 32:58.478
This looks delicious.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.521
As I was saying...

32:59.562 --> 33:01.606
Mm!

33:01.648 --> 33:04.484
Wow, that's amazing.

33:04.526 --> 33:05.860
Mat has set a bar.

33:05.902 --> 33:07.821
-Are they happy?
-Yeah.

33:07.862 --> 33:08.905
-How are you?
-Good.

33:08.947 --> 33:09.989
You should be exhausted.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.449
Yep.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.701
You go down now, because
you're not gonna

33:12.742 --> 33:14.202
get a full eight hours.

33:14.244 --> 33:16.329
I'll keep you
around a little longer,

33:16.371 --> 33:17.330
and see how we're looking.

33:17.372 --> 33:18.790
It's Gucci.

33:18.832 --> 33:20.750
Okay, and I've
gotta eat something.

33:20.792 --> 33:21.876
-Have you not eaten?
-Mm-mmm.

33:21.918 --> 33:23.003
Go and eat!

33:23.044 --> 33:24.629
Whew, all right.

33:25.672 --> 33:26.965
Five minutes.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.758
What's been your
favorite part so far?

33:28.800 --> 33:31.970
The hike and just
the whole picnic setup

33:32.012 --> 33:34.514
was like being in a movie.

33:34.556 --> 33:36.307
We're not an go
to shabby places.

33:36.349 --> 33:40.812
So, everywhere we anchor,
it's pretty spectacular.

33:40.854 --> 33:43.481
-Are we good to plate, Katie?
-Yeah, go for it.

33:43.523 --> 33:45.650
Okay, here we go.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.360
I've been on my feet all day.

33:47.402 --> 33:48.945
Rigatoni bolognese.

33:53.908 --> 33:55.368
For your second course tonight,

33:55.410 --> 33:58.288
we have rigatoni
bolognese with parmesan.

33:58.329 --> 33:59.622
Where's the Italian accent?

33:59.664 --> 34:02.751
You got rigatoni bolognese
with parmesan.

34:06.421 --> 34:07.547
-Unbelievable.
-Yeah.

34:07.589 --> 34:08.548
That's amazing.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.383
Yahhh!

34:10.425 --> 34:12.552
Mat the super-human.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.554
-Hey, what's the vibe?
-They love it.

34:14.596 --> 34:18.433
Ooh, she's a Katie, whoa...
they want more parm?

34:18.475 --> 34:19.934
Just want a tiny bit more bread.

34:24.981 --> 34:26.524
Do you smell that magunga?

34:26.566 --> 34:29.402
-Local grilled black sea bass.
-Local roasted.

34:29.444 --> 34:30.487
Local roasted black sea bass.

34:30.528 --> 34:31.696
Whole bass, yeah.

34:34.449 --> 34:35.450
-Ooh!
-Amazing!

34:35.492 --> 34:37.077
-Beautiful.
-Thank you.

34:37.118 --> 34:40.622
So, for your main course, local
whole roasted black sea bass

34:40.663 --> 34:44.334
with sautÃ©ed spinach and
caper and artichoke sauce.

34:44.376 --> 34:46.336
Looks so good.

34:46.378 --> 34:47.337
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow.

34:47.379 --> 34:49.297
Oh, my gosh.

34:50.715 --> 34:52.300
Got you.

34:52.342 --> 34:54.636
All right, Z-money,
so for morning shift,

34:58.556 --> 35:00.517
-Yeah.
-Good night, dude.

35:00.558 --> 35:01.935
-Night, Malia.
-Night.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.436
-Are they happy?
-Yes.

35:03.478 --> 35:04.938
Who's the happiest?

35:04.979 --> 35:07.649
Please say Sandy, please say
Sandy, please say Sandy.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.442
She's telling her stories, hey?

35:09.484 --> 35:11.778
So, I said over the radio,
"I'm an American citizen,

35:11.820 --> 35:13.530
sustained a fire, floating
in Yemen territory."

35:14.698 --> 35:15.949
Ah, bless ya.

35:15.990 --> 35:18.493
-Hey, lady!
-How are you?

35:18.535 --> 35:19.786
Gosh, you're high-energy.

35:19.828 --> 35:22.789
Two-person team...
better than four.

35:22.831 --> 35:24.082
A lot of work for us, though.

35:26.084 --> 35:27.460
-Yeah.
-So good.

35:27.502 --> 35:28.670
-I am going to go.
-Aw!

35:28.712 --> 35:30.755
But thank you, it was lovely.

35:30.797 --> 35:32.507
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

35:34.175 --> 35:35.927
Mathew, the dinner
was excellent.

35:35.969 --> 35:36.970
Thank you so much.

35:38.555 --> 35:39.723
One thing...

35:39.764 --> 35:41.641
my plate had a lot
of dark fish.

35:41.683 --> 35:43.018
Dark fish?

35:43.059 --> 35:44.394
I don't think you
should ever serve that.

35:44.436 --> 35:45.812
-I don't like that.
-Okay.

35:45.854 --> 35:46.980
My plate was full of it.

35:47.022 --> 35:48.356
Sorry about that.

35:48.398 --> 35:49.899
No, I mean,
now you know, eh?

36:00.076 --> 36:01.119
Mathew, my plate had
a lot of dark fish.

36:03.705 --> 36:04.956
Dark fish?

36:04.998 --> 36:06.583
-I don't like that.
-Okay.

36:06.624 --> 36:07.751
My plate was full of it.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.002
Sorry about that.

36:09.044 --> 36:10.837
No, I mean, now you know.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.215
Get rid of the dark,
give 'em the white.

36:14.257 --> 36:15.550
They... it was delicious.

36:15.592 --> 36:16.718
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.178
I just love there's no eyeballs.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.721
-Yeah, they were lovely.
-They loved your food.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.723
-Good.
-Thank you.

36:21.765 --> 36:22.766
Thank you!

36:22.807 --> 36:24.225
Sandy's 100 percent right.

36:24.267 --> 36:26.019
She shouldn't have been
served the dark meat.

36:26.061 --> 36:27.937
If I get a piece of fish at
the restaurant that was bass

36:27.979 --> 36:29.856
that was more
dark meat than white,

36:29.898 --> 36:31.524
I would be disappointed, too.

36:39.282 --> 36:40.450
Stop fishing me.

36:44.496 --> 36:45.705
I'm not a ----ing mother.

36:51.878 --> 36:53.213
Oh, hey!

36:53.254 --> 36:54.881
A butterfly?

36:54.923 --> 36:56.591
-It's a moth, I think.
-I'll pass it on.

36:56.633 --> 36:57.759
Yeah, I'll take him.

36:57.801 --> 36:59.219
Ah, that's great!

36:59.260 --> 37:01.096
-Thank you.
-What up?

37:01.137 --> 37:02.597
Yo.

37:03.807 --> 37:05.725
-Have a good shift.
-Sleep, man.

37:07.644 --> 37:08.937
There's a couple in the middle.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.730
-I'm going to bed.
-Ah.

37:10.772 --> 37:12.107
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

37:12.148 --> 37:13.775
Good night, Malia, thank you.

37:32.210 --> 37:33.837
[snoring]

37:43.680 --> 37:45.181
Morning.
Would you like a coffee?

37:45.223 --> 37:46.975
-Yes, please.
-Cool.

37:47.017 --> 37:48.643
Let's see what today
has in store.

37:48.685 --> 37:50.020
There you go.

37:50.061 --> 37:51.604
Thank you.

37:53.815 --> 37:54.899
Hey, hey.

37:54.941 --> 37:55.984
Ready for drop-off day?

37:56.026 --> 37:58.028
Yeah, my back can't take it.

38:07.704 --> 38:09.831
-Morning!
-Hey, good morning.

38:09.873 --> 38:10.874
How are you?

38:14.794 --> 38:16.296
[bleep]

38:19.716 --> 38:21.009
Yeah.

38:21.051 --> 38:22.844
I completely forgot
about the paddleboards.

38:22.886 --> 38:24.804
There's a lot of responsibility
on the morning shift.

38:24.846 --> 38:27.599
It's just frustrating, because
I know that I can do better.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.809
Why waste time in the gym when
you could be on a paddleboard?

38:30.894 --> 38:32.020
-Enjoy it!
-Appreciate it.

38:32.062 --> 38:33.730
-Good morning.
-Morning.

38:35.357 --> 38:36.691
Yeah.

38:36.733 --> 38:37.984
-So, this morning?
-Mm-hmm?

38:41.196 --> 38:43.198
At 7:30.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.699
So, who's your early
morning guy?

38:44.741 --> 38:46.117
Mzi.

38:46.159 --> 38:47.160
Ah.

38:48.286 --> 38:49.913
Thank you.

38:56.753 --> 38:58.254
Let me get you a paddle.

38:58.296 --> 39:00.048
Oh, I'm just sitting on
her board, like a dog.

39:00.090 --> 39:01.049
-You're just gonna sit on it?
-Yeah.

39:01.091 --> 39:02.717
-Ah.
-How are you?

39:02.759 --> 39:04.052
Working hard.

39:04.094 --> 39:05.887
We thought Lechelle went
out on the paddleboard;

39:05.929 --> 39:06.971
now the other lady's with her.

39:07.013 --> 39:09.349
[bleep] yeah, drop-off day.

39:09.391 --> 39:10.892
[bleep] yeah.

39:10.934 --> 39:12.936
Um, quick note about mornings.

39:12.977 --> 39:14.938
The paddleboards
should actually be out.

39:14.979 --> 39:16.106
-Out.
-Yeah.

39:16.147 --> 39:17.941
-Sorry.
-Oh, you're up early?

39:17.982 --> 39:20.068
How did you sleep?

39:20.110 --> 39:21.820
Amazing!

39:21.861 --> 39:23.321
Hello, Mathew.

39:23.363 --> 39:25.073
-All's well.
-Okay, bye.

39:25.115 --> 39:26.199
Bye.

39:31.287 --> 39:33.707
-How did everyone sleep?
-Thank you so much.

39:40.296 --> 39:42.048
Leaving such
a supportive bubble,

39:42.090 --> 39:44.342
I'm concerned what's gonna
happen after the season

39:44.384 --> 39:47.762
and being able to go forward
and have to deal

39:47.804 --> 39:50.390
with trying to get that level
of acceptance from new people.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.897
-Banana bread.
-Wow.

39:57.939 --> 39:59.399
If anyone wants a last
water sports sesh,

39:59.441 --> 40:01.651
we do have to be
anchors up shortly.

40:01.693 --> 40:03.278
-Okay, we're good.
-Nice.

40:03.319 --> 40:04.738
Katie?

40:04.779 --> 40:06.448
So, herreros rancheros,
chipotle...

40:06.489 --> 40:07.657
Chipotle salsa.

40:10.785 --> 40:12.203
Oh, my gosh, wow.

40:14.789 --> 40:17.834
Oh, yes, this is
my kinda thing.

40:17.876 --> 40:21.004
Katie?
What's the vibe?

40:21.046 --> 40:22.380
I just wanna know
if they hate me.

40:22.422 --> 40:24.215
They ----ing love you,
I swear to God.

40:24.257 --> 40:26.134
I will hate you in a minute.

40:26.176 --> 40:27.469
Don't.

40:27.510 --> 40:32.057
I feel insecure
when I get any criticism.

40:32.098 --> 40:35.143
All I can hear is I ----ed up,
and that's not healthy.

40:35.185 --> 40:36.978
-All right!
-Do you need a hand?

40:37.020 --> 40:38.480
-The duo is back!
-The duo!

40:38.521 --> 40:42.317
All crew, all crew,
ETA to the anchor is 16 minutes.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.027
Copy that.

40:45.987 --> 40:47.197
-Coming up.
-Coming up.

40:49.991 --> 40:51.326
-Lloyd?
-Yeah.

40:51.368 --> 40:52.494
You wanna run forward and
prep the anchors?

40:52.535 --> 40:53.703
Yeah.

40:53.745 --> 40:55.163
Coming up on the transom.

40:55.205 --> 40:57.207
Mzi, run forward
for anchors, please.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.835
Bridge, bridge, that
is the transom closed

41:00.877 --> 41:02.504
and us ready to haul the anchor.

41:02.545 --> 41:05.340
<i>Terrific, you can start</i>
<i>hauling anchor</i>

41:05.382 --> 41:06.841
<i>as soon as you're up there.</i>

41:06.883 --> 41:07.967
I love this.

41:11.054 --> 41:12.305
She just said you can
haul the anchor.

41:12.347 --> 41:13.807
Oh, sorry.

41:17.769 --> 41:20.063
Anchor is at the water line,
at the water line.

41:21.856 --> 41:23.733
Anchor is home, anchor is home.

41:29.781 --> 41:31.032
I'm gonna go pack and change.

41:31.074 --> 41:32.409
I'm gonna go watch
them back it in.

41:32.450 --> 41:35.370
What the [bleep]?

41:35.412 --> 41:37.455
The fender's in the wrong spot.

41:37.497 --> 41:40.333
Please take the
anchor ball down,

41:40.375 --> 41:42.210
please take
the anchor ball down.

41:42.252 --> 41:43.503
[bleep]'s sake!

41:43.545 --> 41:44.963
Ugh!

41:45.005 --> 41:46.881
-Copy.
-We don't look like pros.

41:46.923 --> 41:48.091
Ugh!

41:48.133 --> 41:49.884
I think people are
getting tired,

41:49.926 --> 41:53.013
and they're not doing a
thorough check of their work,

41:53.054 --> 41:55.390
and I'm not gonna let it fly.

41:55.432 --> 41:57.058
What up?

41:57.100 --> 41:58.768
Happy epaulette Friday
to you, sir.

41:58.810 --> 42:01.021
<i>Nine minutes till</i>
<i>we get to the marina.</i>

42:01.062 --> 42:02.147
Copy, understood.

42:02.188 --> 42:03.523
You have four minutes.

42:03.565 --> 42:05.150
Change into your epaulettes.

42:05.191 --> 42:06.276
How's it going?

42:06.317 --> 42:07.569
Yeah, it's gonna be a new...

42:07.610 --> 42:10.196
David, get out on deck,
please, now.

42:10.238 --> 42:11.948
Heaving lines, set up, please.

42:14.451 --> 42:16.077
Let's go.

42:16.119 --> 42:18.246
<i>Six minutes till we</i>
<i>get to the marina.</i>

42:18.288 --> 42:20.123
[bleep]'s sake.

42:22.208 --> 42:24.085
Mzi, Mzi, Lloyd.

42:24.127 --> 42:25.378
I think he's getting his whites
on, he might be off the comms.

42:27.172 --> 42:29.257
Malia, I'm moving to
the starboard wing station,

42:29.299 --> 42:31.426
so let me know when your dock
guys are on the stern.

42:31.468 --> 42:32.927
Yep, copy that.

42:32.969 --> 42:34.512
Dave, Dave, or Malia, can

42:34.554 --> 42:36.473
I get some help getting
this fender to its holder?

42:36.514 --> 42:38.099
On my way, Lloyd.

42:38.141 --> 42:40.935
That's awesome.

42:40.977 --> 42:42.228
You're gonna be on the bow,
if that's okay.

42:42.270 --> 42:43.271
-Yeah.
<i>-Two minutes.</i>

42:43.313 --> 42:44.439
All right, good to drop.

42:44.481 --> 42:47.275
-Yeah.
-Fenders over!

42:47.317 --> 42:49.569
Lloyd, Lloyd, port bow line,
port bow line.

42:49.611 --> 42:51.571
Fifteen feet and closing
to the vessel astern.

42:51.613 --> 42:52.989
We need to walk to port.

42:53.031 --> 42:55.450
Well, everybody else
is backed in.

42:55.492 --> 42:56.576
No pressure.

42:56.618 --> 42:58.161
Throwing stern lines.

43:00.663 --> 43:02.916
Port to spring going across now.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.543
<i>Port bow line on.</i>

43:05.585 --> 43:08.254
<i>Five feet off the dock, getting</i>
<i>stern lines across now.</i>

43:09.381 --> 43:10.340
-Come on, Mzi.
-Ah!

43:10.382 --> 43:12.384
Quick!

43:12.425 --> 43:14.469
Ugh.

43:14.511 --> 43:16.388
Okay, we can put this one on,
we can put this one on.

43:16.429 --> 43:18.098
Bump ahead.

43:18.139 --> 43:20.600
The port dolphin is right
in front of me, I can't.

43:20.642 --> 43:22.560
We're in their ground line.

43:22.602 --> 43:25.105
We're about to hit some ground
lines, and it's my fault.

43:27.065 --> 43:28.191
[bleep]'s sake!

43:28.233 --> 43:30.360
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:30.402 --> 43:32.153
This is my favorite night out,

43:32.195 --> 43:33.405
I think because
Lexi wasn't here.

43:33.446 --> 43:35.031
Oh sh--, here we go.

43:40.537 --> 43:43.915
It really, really
gets under my skin

43:43.957 --> 43:45.875
when we start making
rookie-rookie mistakes.

43:45.917 --> 43:48.586
If you see me hustling,
I expect to see you hustling.

43:48.628 --> 43:51.089
My stomach's so sore,
I don't get it.

43:51.131 --> 43:53.383
I just feel sick.
Maybe it's, like, nerves.

43:53.425 --> 43:54.884
Everyone's very anxious.

43:54.926 --> 43:58.179
Lloyd, slow down.

43:58.221 --> 43:59.180
You can't even tell the colors.

43:59.222 --> 44:00.515
Something is off with Lloyd.

44:00.557 --> 44:02.225
[vomiting]

44:02.267 --> 44:04.060
I'm sending Lloyd ashore
because his blood pressure

44:04.102 --> 44:06.354
is really high,
he has chest pains.

44:06.396 --> 44:07.522
Wait, what happened to Lloyd?

44:07.564 --> 44:10.233
-What happened?
-It's serious.
