[instrumental music]

00:47.297 --> 00:49.799
You know what I've never seen?
Porn.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.010
I was just thinking about
renting a ton of porn.

00:52.093 --> 00:55.096
- You're not renting any porn.
- In two days, I can.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.639
I'll be 18.
I can rent porn.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.726
I can buy porn,
I can be in porn.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.811
Trust me,
you don't want to be in a porn.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.313
The floors are filthy.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.941
I wasn't in one.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.778
I rented a documentary
about the making of.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.362
So, the nakeds were all

01:11.446 --> 01:13.198
running around the kitchen
during their breaks

01:13.281 --> 01:14.532
and bending down to the fridge

01:14.616 --> 01:17.911
and getting yogurt
and raisins and stuff.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.996
Ew.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.998
Okay, well, I'm over porn.

01:22.081 --> 01:24.000
But there's, like, a million
other things I can do.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.085
Huh, I know.
When I was 18.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.004
I went completely wild.

01:28.087 --> 01:32.258
I was the biggest...virgin.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.385
Okay, well, it's not so much
what you can do

01:34.469 --> 01:35.804
but how you feel.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.263
I've always felt like a kid

01:37.347 --> 01:39.349
and I finally
feel like an adult.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.601
Oh, goody, goody
is that today's mail?

01:41.684 --> 01:44.646
Did Nana's birthday card come?
Oh, it did.

01:46.105 --> 01:48.483
Oh! It came. I'm rich.

01:48.566 --> 01:51.027
I love my birthday.
I love Nana, look.

01:51.110 --> 01:54.113
Your grandmother sent you
$2000 for your birthday?

01:54.197 --> 01:56.699
She did the same thing for me
on my 18th birthday.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.451
Oh, my God.
My grandmother died.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.621
And all I got was her
old diabetic candy.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.706
So, what are you
going to do with it?

02:03.790 --> 02:06.042
How much is a Corvette?

02:06.125 --> 02:08.586
- I-I have a suggestion.
- What?

02:08.669 --> 02:10.213
Why don't you
put it in the bank?

02:10.295 --> 02:11.548
No, no, no, no, no.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.800
See, those were not
Nana's instructions.

02:13.883 --> 02:14.968
You see?

02:15.051 --> 02:17.220
"Dear, Holly,
do not put this money

02:17.303 --> 02:20.890
in the bank like your sister
did, she's not fun, love, Nana."

02:20.974 --> 02:22.684
Aww..

02:22.767 --> 02:25.395
This has nothing to do
with being fun, alright?

02:25.478 --> 02:27.480
It's about self-control.
It's about being an adult.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.940
And don't you think
I would love to go out

02:29.023 --> 02:31.317
and blow 2000 bucks
on something frivolous?

02:31.401 --> 02:33.236
- No.
- No.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.529
Let me tell you something.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.239
A few doors down
from Dean &amp; Deluca's

02:36.322 --> 02:38.449
there is this cute boutique,
and in the window

02:38.533 --> 02:41.744
is the most gorgeous Marc Jacobs
bag I have ever seen.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.580
Every time
I pass by that store

02:43.663 --> 02:45.415
I walk in, I touch it.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.666
I walk out.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.918
Hmm. I do the same thing
to the coffee guy

02:49.002 --> 02:51.212
at Dean &amp; Deluca's.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.714
The point is

02:52.797 --> 02:54.340
I mean, I would love to go out

02:54.424 --> 02:55.884
and blow 2000 bucks
on something.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.177
But I have self-control.
It's called being an adult.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.804
Yeah, well, it's my money.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.472
Yes, I know.
It's your money.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.308
And I'm not going to tell you
what to do.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.351
You're going to be 18 soon,
and this is your choice

03:05.435 --> 03:06.394
what you want to do with it.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.229
Well, I choose to spend it.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.065
Well, if that's your choice

03:11.149 --> 03:12.942
it's the wrong one.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.611
And you're not going to be 18
until Saturday

03:14.694 --> 03:15.987
and until then,
I am the boss of you

03:16.070 --> 03:17.447
and that money
is going into the bank.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.698
Okay, fine, I'll put it

03:18.781 --> 03:20.199
in the dumb boring bank

03:20.283 --> 03:24.329
and I'll live a very dull
responsible, boring life.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.788
Thatagirl.

03:27.582 --> 03:31.127
- Whee!
- Okay, okay, my turn.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.129
Gary, reset the money.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.547
- What is this?
- Money!

03:34.631 --> 03:37.634
You want a turn?
Gary can reset it.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.177
I thought you took the check
to the bank.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.430
I did, and look
what they gave me in return.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.641
You cashed it?
What were you thinking?

03:44.724 --> 03:48.811
No, I wasn't thinking.
I was high on the green.

03:48.895 --> 03:49.938
Okay, well, gather it up.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.189
We are taking this
back to the bank.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.440
No, we're not.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.192
I am two days away
from being an adult

03:54.275 --> 03:55.818
and I have already made
my adult decision

03:55.902 --> 03:57.820
about what I am going to do
with my money.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.739
Okay, uh,
what is that adult decision?

03:59.822 --> 04:01.991
I'm going to throw myself
a kick-ass birthday party

04:02.075 --> 04:04.869
in one of them fancy suites
at the Plaza.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.498
- The Plaza?
- Uh-huh, the Palaza Hotel.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.668
Oh, yeah.
That's adult, Holly.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.170
- Very adult.
- Okay, you know what?

04:14.253 --> 04:15.463
From one adult to another

04:15.546 --> 04:17.005
you're giving me
a lot of attitude.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.882
So why don't we just have
an adult discussion

04:18.966 --> 04:20.635
about what's really
bothering you?

04:20.718 --> 04:23.721
You mean the fact that you want
to throw $2000 away

04:23.805 --> 04:25.473
at the Plaza Hotel

04:25.556 --> 04:29.352
or that you're rolling around
like a pig in its own poopy?

04:30.603 --> 04:31.604
You know what?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.189
You cannot stand the fact

04:33.272 --> 04:35.358
that you're not going to be
able to control me anymore.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.027
Control you, Holly,
that is not what this is about.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.446
For 17 years,
I've been your little puppet.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.533
And in two days,
we're going to cut the strings.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.869
Okay, this is not about control.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.830
This is about common sense.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.040
Holly, we're talking
about $2000.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.042
I'm just trying to make..
Would you stop doing that?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.711
- Are we done?
- Yes.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.878
Okay.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.923
You know what? Fine.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.675
Throw your money away.
I don't care.

05:00.758 --> 05:01.926
And you know what?
I'll tell you this.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.052
I am not coming

05:03.136 --> 05:05.013
to your irresponsible party.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.473
Oh, my God.
Look at all that money.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.852
Oh, I've always wanted to roll
around in a big wad of cash.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.239
So she is gonna blow
the entire $2000 on a party

05:23.322 --> 05:24.574
at some stupid hotel.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.702
Well, I-I wouldn't call it
a stupid hotel.

05:27.785 --> 05:28.786
It's the Plaza.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.413
It's one of the most romantic

05:30.496 --> 05:31.581
places on Earth.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.082
I mean, I've heard
some people

05:33.166 --> 05:34.208
even get married there.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.543
[laughs]

05:35.626 --> 05:37.962
Not us.
We like small and intimate.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.173
[chuckles]

05:41.883 --> 05:44.093
So, uh, have you guys
started thinking about

05:44.177 --> 05:45.219
where you want to get married?

05:45.303 --> 05:46.471
- Oh, I have.
- I have, too.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.764
- Oh, you go first.
- No, you go.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.140
- No, no, you go.
- You go. You.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.433
Okay. Alright, well,
since we both like

05:50.516 --> 05:53.227
small and intimate,
I was thinking

05:53.311 --> 05:54.687
my parents' backyard.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.689
[laughing]

05:59.358 --> 06:02.153
Oh, my God, it's like
you're reading my mind.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.573
Oh, this is going to mean
so much to my parents

06:05.656 --> 06:07.033
and wait until you see
their backyard.

06:07.116 --> 06:10.161
- There are tons of trees.
- Ooh, trees.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.163
That's good for shade.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.456
Yeah, and there's this
big path

06:13.539 --> 06:14.832
where all the dogs run loose

06:14.916 --> 06:17.210
and I can just see you
coming up that path

06:17.293 --> 06:19.796
right next to the bird baths.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.007
Bird baths.
That's good for something.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.760
Yeah, yeah, my mom's got
this thing for bird baths.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.345
They're all over.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.846
'Well, there's just
one problem, though.'

06:28.930 --> 06:33.059
Sometimes, you can see
the neighbor's donkey.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.812
A jackass at my wedding?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.980
That is something..

06:38.064 --> 06:40.983
...that no one ever does.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.820
- Isn't she fantastic?
- Oh, she is the best.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.788
Okay, so bring it on.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.373
- Who wants to go first?
- I do, here.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.792
- Oh, Goody. Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.168
Aw.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.672
From my best friend Tina.
A plug.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.173
It's a voltage converter

07:04.257 --> 07:05.967
for your trip to Paris
if you get the internship.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.468
You know for your
blow dryer and stuff.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.679
Thank you, but what if I
don't get accepted?

07:09.762 --> 07:10.930
You will.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.390
Here, I got you a little

07:12.473 --> 07:15.852
something for Paris too.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.520
Disposable razors.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.230
That's for here,
they don't know nothing

07:19.313 --> 07:21.023
about that in Paris.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.525
Thank you.
This is really sweet.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.027
- Okay, my turn.
- Mmm.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.615
A camera?
Henry, a digital camera?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.701
- A camera?
- A camera?

07:31.784 --> 07:34.537
Damn, man.
I thought we set a $10 limit.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.164
You're making Tina feel
all embarrassed

07:36.247 --> 07:39.083
about her cheap-ass plug.
It's okay.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.669
- Henry, this is too much.
- Hey, come on.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.839
You're turning 18.
It's a big deal.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.216
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.301
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Vince.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.760
- Hey.
- What's going on?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.762
Well, Holly's just opening
her birthday gifts.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.557
We all got her a camera.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.934
What did you get her?

07:57.018 --> 07:59.228
I got her something.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.443
- Knock yourself out.
- Oh, $20.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.278
I'll just put it
right here next to 2000

08:07.361 --> 08:09.363
of its buddies.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.574
- Oh, my God.
- What-what's the matter?

08:11.657 --> 08:13.492
I put it in this pocket.
It's my birthday money.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.744
It was in an envelope.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.829
Holly, you were
carrying 2000 bucks

08:16.913 --> 08:18.497
around in your pocket?
Are you--

08:18.581 --> 08:21.375
Screwed, yeah, yeah.
I'm screwed.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.294
Calm down. Maybe
it's in the loft. Just call Val.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.421
- No, no, no. I can't call Val.
- Why not?

08:25.504 --> 08:26.923
Because I just spent
the whole morning

08:27.006 --> 08:28.382
trying to tell her
that I'm not a kid anymore

08:28.466 --> 08:31.802
and this is like below kid.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.763
Look, look, the loft
is right across the street.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.847
Um, it has to be somewhere
between here and there.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.433
Okay, well,
you guys look outside

08:37.515 --> 08:38.893
and I'm gonna
go back to the loft.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.269
And don't worry,
we're going to do everything

08:40.352 --> 08:41.604
we can to get
that money back.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.981
- Oh, thank you, Gary.
- Finder keepers.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.658
I mean, is it selfish
that I don't want to

08:53.741 --> 08:56.077
get married in a yard?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.828
I have a dream wedding

08:57.912 --> 09:00.665
and in my dream wedding
there is no donkey.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.710
Hey, are you even
listening to me?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.295
No.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.713
I'm sorry.
I just, uh..

09:07.797 --> 09:09.215
I'm a little
preoccupied right now.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.883
- Holly?
- Yes, Holly.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.010
- You know, it is her money.
- It's not just the money.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.137
I mean, look at this.
Do you see this cereal bowl?

09:15.221 --> 09:17.848
This has been sitting here
since this morning, yeah.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.183
Miss Big Shot,
"I'm turning 18

09:19.267 --> 09:20.810
I'm going to live in Paris
on my own"

09:20.893 --> 09:22.645
can't even clean up after
herself, and you know why?

09:22.728 --> 09:24.647
Because she has me
around to do it for her.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.024
- So don't do it.
- I have to.

09:27.108 --> 09:30.152
Otherwise, I have to look
at cereal bowls all day.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.821
Did you ever think
that maybe you're being

09:31.904 --> 09:33.656
just a little bit hard on her?

09:33.739 --> 09:36.158
Okay, yes, she does leave
cereal bowls out

09:36.242 --> 09:37.827
but at least
she's not running around

09:37.910 --> 09:41.539
with the nakeds
eating yogurt and raisins.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.416
Seriously, she's a good kid.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.751
No, she is irresponsible.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.337
Weren't you irresponsible
when you were 18?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.006
If someone had given you
2000 bucks

09:50.089 --> 09:51.048
wouldn't you blow it?

09:51.132 --> 09:53.050
Uh, someone did, remember?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.845
Nana gave me $2000
for my birthday, too.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.139
And I invested it
in a high-yield CD.

09:58.222 --> 10:01.058
And now it is worth $5698.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.396
- Party on, dude.
- You know what, Lauren?

10:05.479 --> 10:07.023
Talk to me when you have
a little sister

10:07.106 --> 10:08.357
that you have to take care of.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.900
Oh, my parents
don't have sex anymore.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.861
That's not going to happen.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.571
Okay, one more thing

10:13.654 --> 10:15.197
and then I will stop.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.574
I just think that maybe

10:16.657 --> 10:18.743
you should let her make her
own mistakes.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.165
What is this?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.625
Oh, my God.
Holly's $2000.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.044
She must've dropped it
on her way out.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.879
She must be dying.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.590
She's going to be so relieved
when she finds out you found it.

10:32.673 --> 10:36.052
Hmm, yeah,
she will be relieved, someday.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.555
- You're not going to tell her?
- No, hmm-mm.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.391
I'm gonna take your advice.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.226
- What?
- I'm sorry.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.605
It's just that no one's ever
said that to me before.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.148
What advice did I give you?

10:49.231 --> 10:51.275
You said that I should let her
make her own mistakes.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.902
Well, if I give it
right back to her

10:52.985 --> 10:54.487
it's like she never even
made a mistake.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.323
Okay, no, no,
now you're twisting my advice.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.284
What you just said sounds like
something my mom would do.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.286
Well, that is what
I have to be with her sometimes.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.871
She thinks
just because she's 18.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.499
She knows everything.
Well, she doesn't, and I do.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.045
- Hey, birthday girl.
- Hey.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.214
- Wassup?
- Nothing.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.967
What are you doing, looks like
you're looking for something.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.511
No. No, no, no,
everything's great.

11:18.594 --> 11:22.098
Life is good,
never been happier.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.766
Oh, hey, did you, uh

11:23.849 --> 11:26.185
book your big fancy suite
for your birthday party?

11:26.268 --> 11:27.645
- Sure did.
- Oh, really.

11:27.728 --> 11:28.771
Did they ask for
a big deposit?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.439
How much did you give them?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.233
A thousand bucks.

11:32.316 --> 11:35.111
Thousand bucks, wow, you feel
good about that, do you?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.445
Yeah.
Well, never better.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.406
Because unlike you,
I like to have fun.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.116
Oh. So do I.
I bet you can't tell.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.118
But right now
I'm having a ball.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.212
Hey, did you find it? Please
tell me you found it, please.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.798
- Sorry. Nothing.
- Yeah, we looked everywhere.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.634
I can't believe
I lost $2000.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.010
Well, you know what they say.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.846
It's better to have had $2000

12:01.929 --> 12:04.807
and lost it than to
never have had it at all.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.642
Okay, first of all
that's love.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.436
Second of all, shut up.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.481
Okay, here's the thing,
if I'm going to be an adult.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.650
I have to start acting like one.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.193
So here's
what I'm going to do.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.988
If Val asks, we had
a great time at the hotel

12:19.071 --> 12:20.906
it was totally fun..

12:20.990 --> 12:22.158
What?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.576
Why don't you just
tell her the truth?

12:23.659 --> 12:24.785
It'd be so much easier.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.328
Because Val's
one of those people

12:26.412 --> 12:29.540
who thinks losing $2000
is irresponsible.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.711
- Hey.
- Hey? Anything?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.671
I'm sorry.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.466
Okay. That's it.
It's gone.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.550
Well, hey, you know what?

12:39.633 --> 12:40.801
Maybe this was
supposed to happen.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.386
Maybe the person
who found that money

12:42.470 --> 12:44.013
really needed it.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.474
Gary, give me back
the money.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.693
[gasps]

12:57.776 --> 13:00.321
Hello, Holly's money.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.281
Oh, look at you.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.783
You are just so beautiful.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.126
[laughing]

13:14.210 --> 13:15.169
'Oh, money.'

13:15.252 --> 13:17.922
[Lauren laughing]

13:18.005 --> 13:19.673
This is so much fun.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.760
Oh, I've always
wanted to do this.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.095
I knew it would be
this much fun.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.722
'Oh, money,
money, money, money.'

13:26.805 --> 13:28.724
[laughing]

13:38.901 --> 13:41.445
I'm sure
you're very upset right now.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.448
So I would like
to give you $2000.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.499
[sobbing]

14:00.381 --> 14:03.133
Lauren? Oh! My money.
You found my money.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.427
Wait, that is my money, right?

14:05.511 --> 14:08.138
Oh, my God,
where did you find it?

14:08.222 --> 14:09.682
Doctor broke up with me.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.850
Aw, what? Why?

14:11.934 --> 14:13.852
He hates women
who care about money

14:13.936 --> 14:17.898
and then he caught me
rolling around in your cash.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.484
I don't care about money.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.195
I was just having fun.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.116
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.742
Come here..

14:32.121 --> 14:34.081
- So where did you find it?
- What?

14:34.164 --> 14:37.459
- The money.
- I just found it.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.921
- Where?
- I don't know, around.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.339
Lauren, tell me what you know.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.301
I can't, some blonde lady
swore me to secrecy.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.303
[gasps]

14:47.386 --> 14:50.222
Wait, Val found my money
and she didn't tell me?

14:50.306 --> 14:52.016
Why didn't she tell me, Lauren?
Why?

14:52.099 --> 14:55.603
'Cause she's pretty ticked off
about the cereal bowl situation?

14:55.686 --> 14:57.688
- What?
- Look, I don't know.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.982
She's trying to teach you
some kind of lesson.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.483
She doesn't think you're mature

15:01.567 --> 15:03.319
or, like, ready for life
or something.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.321
Oh, and hiding money is mature?

15:05.404 --> 15:08.574
I know. She's weird.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.493
She wants you to learn
from your own mistakes.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.163
Okay, you know what, I've had it
with her little lessons.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.498
You know, I'm going
to teach her a lesson.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.750
Why are you guys
always trying to

15:17.833 --> 15:19.752
teach each other lessons?

15:19.835 --> 15:22.713
Can't you just have slap fights
like normal sisters?

15:32.598 --> 15:35.225
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.520
So, listen, I've been giving it
a lot of thought

15:38.604 --> 15:41.357
and your 18th birthday
is a big event.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.858
So I have decided

15:42.941 --> 15:44.985
I will be coming
to your big fancy

15:45.069 --> 15:46.612
birthday party at the Plaza.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.657
Mm, Val, there is not
going to be

15:49.740 --> 15:51.116
a birthday party.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.160
- What, no party?
- No.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.245
- Why?
- Well.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.914
There's no easy way to say it

15:56.997 --> 15:58.999
so I'm just going to say it.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.087
I somehow lost the $2000.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.547
You're kidding.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.299
Holly, please tell me
you're kidding.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.051
I wish I could.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.011
It was in my jacket pocket
and it fell out

16:11.095 --> 16:14.181
and I don't know how I could
do something so stupid.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.600
You were right.
I was wrong.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.477
I'm sorry. What?

16:19.978 --> 16:23.565
You were right.
I was wrong.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.609
I feel sick.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.029
Oh. Okay.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.573
I have something
I need to show you.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.533
What?

16:32.616 --> 16:33.742
It's probably gonna put a smile

16:33.826 --> 16:35.285
back on your face.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.329
But first,
I want to say thank you

16:37.413 --> 16:38.706
for telling me the truth.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.083
I know it wasn't easy

16:41.166 --> 16:43.919
but part of growing up is..

16:44.002 --> 16:46.130
...being able to..

16:48.090 --> 16:51.218
- Being able to what?
- Uh, uh, what?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.554
You were just saying
that part of growing up

16:53.637 --> 16:56.640
is being able to..

16:56.724 --> 17:00.102
Oh, my God.
It's gone.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.646
- What's gone?
- Your money.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.897
What do you mean?
I lost my money.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.025
No, I-I found it

17:07.108 --> 17:10.404
and I locked it up in here
and now it's gone.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.699
Uh, I don't understand.
Why would you do that?

17:15.242 --> 17:17.994
Because I was trying to
teach you some stupid lesson.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.622
No, no, no, no,
it wasn't stupid.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.374
I'm sure it was
a very good lesson.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.210
It just wasn't
executed properly.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.628
I think that your plan
started to fall apart

17:27.713 --> 17:30.549
when I found this!

17:30.632 --> 17:33.761
Wow, yeah,
that is very amusing.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.139
- Yeah, I think so.
- How did you know I had it?

17:37.222 --> 17:40.017
Lauren was rollin' in it.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.894
Lauren.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.855
How could you do that to me?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.774
Do you have any idea
how freaked out

17:46.857 --> 17:47.900
I was when I lost this?

17:47.983 --> 17:49.568
Good, you should've been
freaked out.

17:49.651 --> 17:50.736
You know,
I think you're being really--

17:50.819 --> 17:52.070
Irresponsible, I know.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.573
And you want me
to learn from my mistakes.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.283
Lauren.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.829
The nice thing to do
when someone loses their money

18:00.913 --> 18:02.164
is to give it back to them

18:02.247 --> 18:04.333
without lessons
or "I told you so's."

18:04.416 --> 18:06.668
- I'm turning 18.
- Yes, I know!

18:06.752 --> 18:08.295
You're turning 18,
and that scares

18:08.378 --> 18:09.630
the hell out of me, Holly.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.925
God, I was so not like you
when I was 18.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.677
I mean, I would've never
blown $2000

18:15.761 --> 18:18.096
on one night at the Plaza,
much less lost it!

18:18.180 --> 18:20.390
Do you know what my biggest
mistake was when I was 18?

18:20.474 --> 18:22.267
A home perm!

18:23.393 --> 18:24.478
Alright.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.563
Come here.
Sit down.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.275
- I have some bad news.
- What?

18:30.359 --> 18:33.111
How do I say this?
Um, I'm not..

18:35.072 --> 18:37.366
...you.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.159
I'm never going to be you

18:39.243 --> 18:41.495
but I've got you.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.580
[sighs]
So don't be scared.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.832
I'm going to be okay

18:44.915 --> 18:47.209
and some of that
"Be responsible" crap

18:47.292 --> 18:49.795
you're always telling me
it's in here.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.965
- It is?
- Yeah.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.300
And where do you think
I learned that?

18:55.384 --> 18:57.094
From me.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.556
And I even use it sometimes.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.808
So relax and trust me.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.145
I trust you.
Okay.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.774
But I'm probably
not going to be able to relax.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.067
Okay, well, this will help.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.153
I think I'm going to put
the money in a bank

19:14.236 --> 19:15.904
a high-yield CD,
or maybe put it away

19:15.988 --> 19:18.365
for, like, graduate school
or something.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.118
Oh, well, it's your money.
You do what you want.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.913
- So you're good?
- I'm good.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.206
Okay.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.716
Yay, it's my 18th birthday

19:35.799 --> 19:38.635
at the Plaza picture
from my generous sister Val.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.846
Lauren, you didn't even smile.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.514
I tried, I swear

19:42.598 --> 19:45.475
but the corners
of my mouth are so sad.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.978
I don't think
they will ever go up again.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.730
Lauren, we talked about this.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.356
We decided it was a good thing,
right?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.358
I mean, what if you
and doctor broke up

19:53.442 --> 19:54.526
after you were married?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.028
- I know.
- Okay?

19:56.111 --> 19:57.863
And you have to wonder
if Brad was that upset

19:57.946 --> 20:00.240
because you were having
a little fun in a pile of money.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.034
It wasn't about the money,
you know?

20:02.117 --> 20:03.410
We have got
a lot of differences.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.870
It never would've worked out,
anyway.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.622
Well, then
why did you say you'd marry him?

20:06.705 --> 20:09.833
Because I was afraid
no one else could ever ask me.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.335
- Aww.
- Aww.

20:11.418 --> 20:14.296
(in unison)
Happy birthday.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.590
To me.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.300
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

20:18.383 --> 20:20.093
What are you guys doing there?

20:21.219 --> 20:23.931
Oh, Val,
you invited them, too?

20:24.014 --> 20:26.308
Yeah, you said you wanted
to have a kick-ass birthday

20:26.391 --> 20:27.851
with all your friends.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.269
Oh, thank you.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.063
Oh, I love room service.
What is it?

20:31.146 --> 20:33.357
Steak, lobster, filet mign..

20:33.440 --> 20:35.692
Pizza.
Whatever, I'm starving.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.235
Come on, Lauren,
you can eat now.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.154
You don't have to be skinny
for the doctor anymore.

20:39.237 --> 20:41.573
And there's the silver lining.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.243
So, is it time for presents?

20:45.327 --> 20:49.081
Uh, Holly, this expensive hotel
thing kinda was your present.

20:49.164 --> 20:52.084
No, no, I know, I'm talking
about my present for you.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.752
Me, I don't understand,
Why would you get me--

20:53.835 --> 20:55.629
Just open it.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.757
Holly.
My Marc Jacobs bag.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.426
Don't be mad at me, I didn't put
the whole 2000 in the bank.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.595
This is the best birthday
you have ever had.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.721
Oh.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.181
Dude, dude,
it's happening again.

21:06.264 --> 21:08.016
Wait, wait, wait.
Ladies, ladies, ladies..

21:08.100 --> 21:10.852
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh. Aw. Jeez.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.356
Now, now...look pouty.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.744
