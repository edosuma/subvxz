>> WELL, FOLKS, IT'S BEEN A
GREAT NIGHT.

17:54.341 --> 17:58.878
I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A MERRY
CHRISTMAS.
AND, REMEMBER, IT'S NOT

17:58.878 --> 18:02.882
CHRISTMAS WITHOUT FIREWORKS AND
HOT DOGS.
>> THAT'S 4th OF JULY, PETE.

18:02.882 --> 18:09.122
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
ANYWAY, WE'VE COME TO THE END OF
THE SHOW, WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME

18:09.122 --> 18:18.164
FOR ME TO SAY
** GOOD-BYE FOR NOW.
** WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN

18:18.164 --> 18:25.939
** YOU KNOW THAT I AM ALWAYS
NEAR

** WAITING FOR YOU, OH
** THE PETE DAVIDSON SHOW
**

19:09.282 --> 19:18.024
NOT ONLY BECAUSE I LOVE SEEING
SWEET INNOCENT VANESSA AS A
NAUGHTY ELF, BUT I REMEMBER HOW

19:18.024 --> 19:20.427
FUN IT WAS.
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS
PLACE.

19:20.427 --> 19:24.898
PEOPLE MAKING STUFF THAT REALLY
MAKES THEM LAUGH.
SO HERE'S SANTA AND HIS ELVES.

19:24.898 --> 19:31.805
>> WITH ONLY A FORTNIGHT LEFT
UNTIL CHRISTMAS, SANTA'S ELVES
WERE HARD AT WORK MAKING TOYS

19:31.805 --> 19:38.812
FOR CHILDREN ALL OVER THE WORLD.
OR WERE THEY?
>> HO, HO, HO!

19:38.812 --> 19:45.352
TIME TO SEE HOW THE CHRISTMAS
TOYS ARE COMING ALONG.
WHAT ON EARTH?

19:45.352 --> 19:55.895
THIS CHOO CHOO HAS NO WHEELS.
AND THIS DOLLY NEEDS HER HEAD.
ELVES APPEAR!

19:55.895 --> 20:02.469
>> SANTA!
YOU BECKENED US?
>> IS THERE SOMETHING WE COULD

20:02.469 --> 20:08.775
DO FOR YOU?
>> IT SOUNDED URGENT, SO WE CAME
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

20:08.775 --> 20:15.148
>> THESE TOYS ARE NOT COMPLETE,
AND WE ARE ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE.
>> OH, NO.

20:15.148 --> 20:21.121
WE ARE SO SORRY.
>> WE LET YOU DOWN BIG-TIME.
>> WE TOTALLY GOOFED.

20:21.121 --> 20:26.259
>> YOU CERTAINLY DID.
I'M SO DISAPPOINTED.
>> YEAH.

20:26.259 --> 20:31.364
I GUESS YOU GOT TO LIKE SHOW US
WHO'S THE BOSS NOW, RIGHT?
RIGHT, SANTA?

20:31.364 --> 20:37.737
LIKE SHOW US WHO'S IN CHARGE?
>> YEAH.
OTHERWISE, HOW WILL WE EVER

20:37.737 --> 20:43.143
LEARN?
>> ME, I LET YOU DISCIPLINE.
>> WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

20:43.143 --> 20:49.249
>> I DON'T KNOW.
SOME KIND OF PUNISHMENT.
>> IT COULD BE BODILY LIKE

20:49.249 --> 20:57.757
SOMETHING WITH MY BODY.
>> WE HAVE VERY FEW LIMITS, WINK
WINK, WIGGLE, WIGGLE.

20:57.757 --> 21:02.829
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU
SILLY ELVES ARE TALKING ABOUT.
I WILL BE BACK AT FIRST

21:02.829 --> 21:07.934
DAYLIGHT, AND I EXPECT THIS
TABLE TO BE FILLED WITH TOYS.
UNDERSTAND?

21:07.934 --> 21:20.146
>> YES, SANTA.
>> YES, SIR.
>> YOU GOT IT.

21:20.146 --> 21:26.586
>> GOOD MORNING, ELVES!
HOW ARE THE TOYS?
>> YOU HAVEN'T DONE A THING!

21:26.586 --> 21:34.461
>> I KNOW.
WE ARE SO BAD.
I GUESS IT'S TIME TO TEACH US A

21:34.461 --> 21:38.565
LESSON.
>> WHAT?
>> WE DESERVE IT.

21:38.565 --> 21:49.009
WE'RE NOT FIT TO LICK YOUR BOOT.
>> BUT WE'LL DO IT IF YOU FORCE
US TO.

21:49.009 --> 21:55.415
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> ARE YOU FED UP, SANTA?
WELL, I GET IT.

21:55.415 --> 22:01.955
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD JUST PULL
DOWN MY LITTLE GREEN PANTS AND
GO TO TOWN ON ME.

22:01.955 --> 22:10.063
>> SPEAKING OF MISTAKES, I JUST
DROPPED A GUM DROP.
WHOOPS.

22:10.063 --> 22:19.072
BETTER GO GET IT.
>> YOU SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKE,
SANTA?

22:19.072 --> 22:24.077
MAYBE YOU NEED TO TAKE CHARGE OF
THAT.
>> YOU ELVES ARE SKATING ON THIN

22:24.077 --> 22:27.080
ICE.
>> OH, YEAH.
SANTA'S GETTING HOT NOW.

22:27.080 --> 22:32.218
WHY DON'T YOU UNZIP YOUR BIG RED
SUIT AND WALK AROUND IN JUST
YOUR BOOTS.

22:32.218 --> 22:36.790
>> STOP AROUND AND LET YOUR
HAIRY BELLY BOUNCE ALL OVER THE
PLACE.

22:36.790 --> 22:42.128
>> YEAH.
AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO
QUESTION WHO'S IN CHARGE.

22:42.128 --> 22:48.968
RIGHT?
GOOD OLD SAINT DICK NICK.
>> CAN YOU PLEASE JUST MAKE SOME

22:48.968 --> 22:53.973
TOYS?
>> OH, LOOK WHAT I FOUND, SANTA.
A CANDLE.

22:53.973 --> 23:00.447
>> IS THIS TO DROP WAX ON OUR
PRIVATES WITH?
>> YOU BETTER PUT JINGLE BELLS

23:00.447 --> 23:05.218
IN OUR MOUTHS BECAUSE WE'RE
SCREAMERS.
>> YEAH.

23:05.218 --> 23:11.124
AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE, YOU CAN
SNOW ALL OVER US.
>> OKAY, ENOUGH!

23:11.124 --> 23:13.226
GUYS!
GUYS!
COME ON, NOW.

23:13.226 --> 23:18.665
GIVE ME A BREAK.
3,000 YEARS AGO, SURE, I WOULD
HAVE TOTALLY TORN INTO ALL OF

23:18.665 --> 23:23.403
YOU.
LOOK, I AM NOT THAT GUY ANYMORE.
AND AFTER YOU WAKE UP IN A BUNCH

23:23.403 --> 23:28.441
OF WEIRD BEDS WITH PEOPLE THAT
YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER MEETING,
YOU START TO WANT SOMETHING

23:28.441 --> 23:32.846
MORE.
AND THAT IS WHEN I REALLY BECAME
SANTA.

23:32.846 --> 23:37.484
>> DOES IT MEAN YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO DO ANYTHING?
>> OH, HE'LL DO SOMETHING, BUT

23:37.484 --> 23:40.720
ONLY WITH ME.
RIGHT, BIG GUY?
>> YOU HEARD HER.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.724
SHE'S THE REAL BOSS AROUND HERE.
>> THAT'S VERY SWEET.
>> YEAH.

23:44.724 --> 23:49.596
THANKS FOR SHARING THAT WITH US.
>> I THINK I NEEDED TO HEAR
THAT.

23:49.596 --> 23:56.770
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.
FINISH YOUR TOYS AND THEN PACK
UP YOUR ELF JUNK.

23:56.770 --> 24:01.574
YOU'RE ALL FIRED.
>> OH, MAN.
COME ON.

24:01.574 --> 24:07.047
>>> I MISS WHEN CHRISTMAS WAS
WORRY-FREE, WHEN THERE WAS NO
PANDEMIC AND THE SCARIEST THING

24:07.047 --> 24:11.751
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT WAS GLOBAL
WARMING.
BACK IN THE DAY, WE THOUGHT THIS

24:11.751 --> 24:16.690
WAS A HUGE DEAL, BUT THEN IT ALL
JUST MAGICALLY DISAPPEARED.
WHAT'S THAT?

24:16.690 --> 24:21.161
OH, IT'S STILL HERE?
AND IT'S STILL BAD.
OH.

24:21.161 --> 24:30.236
WELL, IN THAT CASE, HERE'S ONE
OF MY FAVORITE SKETCHES FROM MY
FIFTH TIME HOSTING IN 1991.

>> GOOD EVENING.

25:05.905 --> 25:12.345
WARMING CHRISTMAS SPECIAL.
IT'S A TRADITION WHICH I FEAR
WILL CONTINUE FOR YEARS TO COME

25:12.345 --> 25:18.918
BECAUSE THE WAY THINGS ARE
GOING, GLOBAL WARMS WILL BE
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME.

25:18.918 --> 25:25.258
NOW, HERE'S SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S
BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, A

BECAUSE AFTER ALL, THE EARTH'S
ATMOSPHERE OPERATES AS A

>> WHEN THERE IS TOO MUCH.
>> OUR CO2 CONCENTRATION HAS

26:09.369 --> 26:20.413
RISEN TO 350 PARTS PER MILLION,
MOSTLY DUE TO THE FOSSIL FUEL
CONSUMPTION AND TRACE GASES.

26:20.413 --> 26:31.324

DEAN, THAT'S NOT SHO.
THAT'S A BASE MOLECULE FOR ALL

26:34.461 --> 26:40.467

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, DEAN, YOU'RE

27:26.579 --> 27:32.686
LOOKING AT THE WORLD'S LARGEST

>> PLEASE.

27:52.138 --> 28:01.815

HAPPEN.
WON'T YOU PLEASE, PLEASE SEND

MONEY TO WHEREVER MONEY IS SENT
TO FIX THIS TERRIBLE TREE THING?
PLEASE!

>> THANK YOU, SALLY.
THANK YOU.
SO YOU SEE, FOLKS, IF THE POLES

28:20.433 --> 28:28.942
CONTINUE TO MELT AS THEY ARE,
WE'LL ALL BE IN HOT WATER.
>> WELL, NOW, WHAT ABOUT THE

28:28.942 --> 28:36.950
FOLKS LIKE ME WHO ALREADY LIVE
IN THE DESERT?

28:36.950 --> 28:42.689
LAS VEGAS WILL ONE DAY RISE TO
156 DEGREES, MAKING IT
UNINHABITABLE AND RENDERING SUCH

28:42.689 --> 28:48.695

WHAT'S THIS?
>> I'M SORRY, CRYSTAL.

29:31.204 --> 29:39.045
I REALIZED THAT GLOBAL WARMING
IS THE THEME OF THIS SPECIAL.
HOWEVER, FUR IS INDEED MURDER.

29:39.045 --> 29:44.718

YOU KNOW, IT'S KILLING US.
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER DAY I SAID
TO LINDA, WE'RE LOSING THE

30:13.413 --> 30:17.150
BLOODY PLANET.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
YOU CAN'T LIVE IN THE SKY OR THE

30:17.150 --> 30:20.353
SUN.
THERE IS NOWHERE TO SAND.
YOU KNOW, YOU'D JUST BE FALLING

30:20.353 --> 30:24.290
ALL THE TIME.
THEN WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

30:24.290 --> 30:28.028
YOU COULD BRING A CHAIR SO YOU
COULD HAVE A SIT.
BUT IF YOU THINK THAT CHAIR IS

30:28.028 --> 30:31.965
NOT GOING TO FALL, YOU'D BE
BLOODY WRONG.
IT WILL.

30:31.965 --> 30:35.869
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
YOU'RE RIGHT BACK WHERE YOU
STARTED STANDING IN THE SKY

30:35.869 --> 30:38.872
WITHOUT A CHAIR.
>> THANK YOU, PAUL.
>> IT'S BLOODY MADNESS.

30:38.872 --> 30:45.578

LIQUIFY EVEN ON THE MILDEST DAY.

HAPPEN.

>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
DOES MY TAN FRIGHTEN YOU?

31:42.202 --> 31:48.208
PERHAPS IT SHOULD.
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE
TAN OF THE FUTURE.

31:48.208 --> 31:58.318
UNLESS AMERICA CHANGES ITS WAYS,
WHEN I LOOK AT A KNOCK-OUT BABE
LIKE DIANE CANNON AND I SEE THE

31:58.318 --> 32:02.389
RAVAGES ON HER LEATHERY, FLAKEY
SKIN, I THINK, MY GOD, WHAT HAVE

32:02.389 --> 32:09.863
THESE FOOLS DONE?
FOR THOSE OF MY GENERATION, FOR
JOHN DEREK, IT MAY BE TOO LATE.

32:09.863 --> 32:19.305
BUT WHO WILL SPEAK FOR THE ROB
LOWES, FOR THE CHAD LOWES?
OR THE TWO COREYS, WHAT KIND OF

32:19.305 --> 32:23.143
TANS CAN THEY EXPECT?
CERTAINLY NOT A HEALTHY, GOLDEN
TAN.

32:23.143 --> 32:29.549
NOT EVEN A TAUNY BRONZE.
THE BEST THEY CAN HOPE FOR IS A
LIGHT COCOA.

32:29.549 --> 32:39.159
THINK ABOUT THAT THIS CHRISTMAS.

YOU SAY?

IT HARKS BACK TO A TIME WHEN

33:26.206 --> 33:29.776
CHRISTMAS SPECIALS WERE WASTEFUL
AND EXCESSIVE.

33:29.776 --> 33:34.781

AND HOPEFULLY THE JETS BOOSTER

37:22.676 --> 37:28.448
SHOTS WILL COME WITH A LITTLE
BIT OF STEROIDS.
>> THE FDA SAID IT WILL

37:28.448 --> 37:32.519
PERMANENTLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET

BETWEEN A BOY AND A STRANGE MAN

39:45.118 --> 39:52.258
AT A DEPARTMENT STORE.
ENJOY!
** IT WAS ALMOST CHRISTMAS DAY

39:52.258 --> 40:01.167

CHORE
** STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
** SIX-YEAR-OLD WAITING

40:07.707 --> 40:14.447
NERVOUSLY
** WHEN I SAW HIM, I WAS SHOCKED
** BECAUSE IN HIS HANDS, HE HELD

40:14.447 --> 40:21.221
A PAIR OF SOCKS
** SAID I WANT TO BUY THESE
SOCKS

40:21.221 --> 40:29.629
** FOR MY DEAR OLD MOM
** IT'S CHRISTMAS, AND THEY'D BE
THE PERFECT SOCKS

40:29.629 --> 40:40.106
** IT'S BEEN A REAL TOUGH YEAR
** SEE, WE GOT A BIRD
** AND IT LOOKS AS IF THE BIRD

40:40.106 --> 40:50.150
HAS FLOWN AWAY
** THE BOY WAS LOW ON CASH
** SO I HELPED HIM OUT

40:50.150 --> 41:00.593
** BUT THEN I HAD TO ASK ABOUT
THIS BIRD
** TELL ME ABOUT THE BIRD

41:00.593 --> 41:08.335
** DID IT SAY ANY WORDS
** OR WAS IT JUST ONE OF THOSE
QUIET BIRDS

41:08.335 --> 41:21.348
** I GUESS I'D SAY QUIET BIRD
** NEVER HEARD A WORD
** JUST A BIRD THAT WE GOT AT

41:21.348 --> 41:29.789
THE STORE
** WELL, I ONCE HAD A BIRD
** NEVER SQUAWKED OR SAID HELLO

41:29.789 --> 41:37.897
** TO ME, THAT'S KIND OF A WASTE
OF A BIRD
** HEY, I'M SORRY, GUYS

41:37.897 --> 41:47.574
** BUT THERE'S A BIG OLD LINE
** CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME THE
MONEY FOR THE SOCKS

41:47.574 --> 42:02.055
** OH, HEY, THAT'S MY BAD
** GO AHEAD, LITTLE BOY
** BUY YOUR MOM THESE PERFECT

42:02.055 --> 42:08.161
SOCKS
** BUT, WAIT, BEFORE YOU DO
** QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU

42:08.161 --> 42:17.103
** DID YOU HAVE A NAME FOR YOUR
BIRD
** GREAT QUESTION, SIR

42:17.103 --> 42:33.219
** WE HAD A NAME FOR OUR BIRD
** AND THAT NAME WAS TJ ROCKS
** TJ ROCKS, THAT'S AN

42:33.219 --> 42:37.924
INTERESTING NAME
** SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS ONE OF A
KIND.

42:37.924 --> 42:40.994
>> I'M SORRY.
CAN YOU MOVE THIS CONVERSATION
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

42:40.994 --> 42:45.465
>> YEAH.
IS HE GOING TO PAY FOR THE
CHRISTMAS SOCKS OR --

42:45.465 --> 42:50.003
>> OH, YEAH.
HANG ON
** THERE YOU ARE, MY SON

42:50.003 --> 42:58.311
** I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

>> SO SHE DOES TALK.

43:42.689 --> 43:50.697
** WITH ALL THE JUNK YARD BOYS
** AND WE WOULD LIKE TO PLAY A
SONG FOR YOU.

43:50.697 --> 44:03.543
>> TWO, THREE, FOUR.
** TO THE JUNK YARD BOYS
** WE WANT TO SPEND CHRISTMAS

44:03.543 --> 44:07.647
WITH YOU
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> TJ, YOU'RE BACK.

44:07.647 --> 44:13.853
>> I LOVE YOU, LITTLE BOY.
>> MERRY CHRISTMAS, MOM.
>> OH, SWEETIE.

44:13.853 --> 44:23.897
>> ONE MORE THING.
WILL YOU MARRY ME?
>> OF COURSE!

44:23.897 --> 44:34.274
** THAT'S THE STORY OF THE
CHRISTMAS SOCKS.
>> GROWING UP, "SATURDAY NIGHT

44:34.274 --> 44:40.413
LIVE" HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON M
LIFE.
LIKE SO MANY OTHERS I IDOLIZED

44:40.413 --> 44:47.253
STEVE MARTIN.
AS A KID, I WOULD MEMORIZE HIS
SKETCHES AND PERFORM THEM FOR

44:47.253 --> 44:51.624
KIDS AT SCHOOL.
THEY HATED.
STEVE MARTIN'S HOLIDAY WISH

44:51.624 --> 44:59.733
AIRED AND IT BLEW ME AWAY.
I MEMORIZED IT AS SOON AS I
COULD AND PERFORMED IT IN SPEECH

44:59.733 --> 45:03.737
CLASS, NOT REALIZING HOW LAME
THAT IS.
IF ANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE

45:03.737 --> 45:11.177
WATCHING, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO HEAR THIS ONE MORE TIME.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, STEVE

45:11.177 --> 45:15.949
MARTIN.
>> IF I HAD ONE WISH THAT I
COULD WISH THIS HOLIDAY SEASON,

45:15.949 --> 45:21.855
IT WOULD BE THAT ALL THE
CHILDREN OF THE WORLD TO JOIN
HANDS AND SING TOGETHER IN THE

45:21.855 --> 45:29.162
SPIRIT OF HARMONY AND PEACE.
IF I HAD TWO WISHES THAT I COULD
MAKE THIS HOLIDAY SEASON, THE

45:29.162 --> 45:33.733
FIRST WOULD BE FOR ALL THE
CHILDREN OF THE WORLD TO JOIN
HANDS AND SING IN A SPIRIT OF

45:33.733 --> 45:41.474
HARMONY AND PEACE.
AND THE SECOND WOULD BE FOR $30
MILLION A MONTH TO BE GIVEN TO

45:41.474 --> 45:45.078
ME.
TAX FREE IN A SWISS BANK
ACCOUNT.

45:45.078 --> 45:50.684
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD THREE WISHES
THAT I WOULD MAKE THIS HOLIDAY
SEASON.

45:50.684 --> 45:54.120
FIRST, OF COURSE, WOULD BE FOR
ALL THE CHILDREN TO GET TOGETHER
AND SING.

45:54.120 --> 46:01.561
THE SECOND WOULD BE FOR THE $30
MILLION EVERY MONTH TO ME.
AND THE THIRD WOULD BE FOR ALL

46:01.561 --> 46:07.033
ENCOMPASSING POWER OVER EVERY
LIVING BEING AND THE ENTIRE
UNIVERSE.

46:07.033 --> 46:12.038
AND IF I HAD FOUR WISHES THAT I
COULD MAKE THIS HOLIDAY SEASON,
FIRST WOULD BE THE CRAP ABOUT

46:12.038 --> 46:17.110
THE KIDS.
I'M DONE.
SECOND WOULD BE FOR THE 30

46:17.110 --> 46:21.481
MILLION, THE THIRD WOULD BE FOR
ALL THE POWER.
AND THE FOURTH WOULD BE TO SET

46:21.481 --> 46:34.594
ASIDE ONE MONTH EACH YEAR TO
HAVE AN EXTENDED 31-DAY ORGASM.
TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT SLOWLY BY

46:34.594 --> 46:43.103
ROSANNE ARCET.
OF COURSE MY LOVELY WIFE CAN
COME TOO.

46:43.103 --> 46:48.575
WAIT A MINUTE.
MAYBE THAT SEX THING SHOULD BE
THE FIRST WISH.

46:48.575 --> 46:51.478
NO, NO.
THE KIDS.
THE KIDS SINGING WOULD BE GREAT.

46:51.478 --> 46:54.080
THAT WOULD BE NICE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHO AM I KIDDING?

46:54.080 --> 47:04.557
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ALL THOSE KIDS TOGETHER.
THE LOGISTICS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

47:04.557 --> 47:08.428
SECOND THE MONEY.
NO, THE POWER SECOND, THEN THE
MONEY AND THEN THE KIDS.

47:08.428 --> 47:11.865
OH, WAIT.
OH, GEEZ.
I FORGOT ABOUT REVENGE AGAINST

47:11.865 --> 47:17.037
MY ENEMIES.
OKAY.
REVENGE AGAINST ALL MY ENEENEMIE

47:17.037 --> 47:20.573
THEY SHOULD DIE LIKE PIGS IN
HELL.
THAT WOULD BE THE FOURTH.

47:20.573 --> 47:27.080
AND OF COURSE MY FIFTH WISH
WOULD BE FOR ALL THE CHILDREN OF
THE WORLD TO JOIN HANDS AND SING

47:27.080 --> 47:34.587
IN THE SPIRIT OF HARMONY AND
PEACE.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, AND MERRY

47:34.587 --> 47:37.624
PEACE.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, AND MERRY
CHRISTMAS.

48:17.664 --> 48:20.066
GOOSE.
>> YES.
>> THANK YOU, REGGIE, BUT I

48:20.066 --> 48:26.106
DON'T THINK THAT'S THE SONG
WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO END OUR
SWEETWATER COMMUNITY CENTER

48:26.106 --> 48:31.678
CHRISTMAS PAGEANT.
>> CAN I HAVE A REASON?
>> IT'S CONFUSING.

48:31.678 --> 48:35.582
DOES THAT MEAN SHE'S SHOVED
INSIDE OF YOU.
>> I DO NOT KNOW BECAUSE I

48:35.582 --> 48:39.052
DIDN'T GIVE IT ANY THOUGHT.
>> YEAH.
WELL, WE APPRECIATE YOUR

48:39.052 --> 48:43.089
EFFORTS.
>> AND I APPRECIATE THEM AS
WELL.

48:43.089 --> 48:45.592
>> OH, BOY.
OKAY.
WHO'S NEXT?

48:45.592 --> 48:52.065
>> THAT IS THE SINGING DUO,
CALEB AND MONTE.
>> HELLO.

48:52.065 --> 48:54.167
HI.
HOW ARE YOU?
[ APPLAUSE ]

48:54.167 --> 48:57.570
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> THANKS.

48:57.570 --> 49:03.777
I AM CALEB, AND THIS IS MONTE.
BUT A QUICK CORRECTION.
WE ARE NOT A SINGING DUO.

49:03.777 --> 49:13.853
I AM THE SINGER AND MONTE PLAYS
THE TRIANGLE, WHICH IS THE BEST
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR

49:13.853 --> 49:18.324
MONTE SING.
>> I LIKE TO SING.
>> BE QUIET.

49:18.324 --> 49:22.729
JUST STOP IT.
NOW BE QUIET RIGHT NOW.
YOU ARE NOT TO SING TODAY.

49:22.729 --> 49:28.468
YOU ARE ONLY HERE BECAUSE WE ARE
COUSINS THROUGH MARRIAGE.
NOW, DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR CUE?

49:28.468 --> 49:33.273

** AND I'LL BE PLAYING AND
SLAYING AND TOOLING ABOUT

50:12.779 --> 50:20.553
WRAPPING AND HAVING A SHOUT
** WHEN YOU HEAR THAT
DING-ALING --

50:20.553 --> 50:27.827
>> THAT'S YOUR CUE, MONTE!
YOU HIT THE TRIANGLE WHEN I SAY
THAT.

50:27.827 --> 50:33.867
>> OKAY.
>> NOW, CAN YOU DO IT?
>> CAN I SING?

50:33.867 --> 50:38.905
>> NO!
NO!
YOU DON'T SING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

50:38.905 --> 50:46.546
SING.
IF YOU CAN SING, THEN YOU'D
SING, BUT YOU CAN'T SING.

50:46.546 --> 50:53.286
I HAVE THE MILLION DOLLAR VOICE,
AND YOU ARE A LUMP.
I'M GOING TO TAKE IT FROM THE

50:53.286 --> 50:57.724
TOP, IF I MIGHT.
>> OR, YOU KNOW, WE COULD JUST
TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT

50:57.724 --> 51:00.427
GOING TO USE YOUR SONG.
>> OH, PLEASE!
I NEED THIS.

51:00.427 --> 51:07.267
I NEED IT SO BAD.
AND WHEN THE DING-ALING HAPPENS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE, IT IS ONE

51:07.267 --> 51:09.903
HECK OF A SONG.
IT REALLY IS.
>> OKAY, FINE.

51:09.903 --> 51:11.805
FINE.
YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN.

HE KNEW THAT FENCE WAS OLD AND
HE DIDN'T REPLACE IT BECAUSE IT
COST 5,000 MORE GUM DROPS THAN

55:20.687 --> 55:27.060
HE WANTED.
IT IS ON YOUR HANDS!

>>> ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS
MEMORIES IS FROM DECEMBER 17th,

1:02:54.808 --> 1:02:57.977
2005.
JACK BLACK WAS THE HOST.
MY DAUGHTER WAS THREE MONTHS OLD

1:02:57.977 --> 1:03:03.350
AT THE TIME.
DURING THE LIVE SHOW, MY FRIEND
DEAL IN THE SNL WARDROBE

1:03:03.350 --> 1:03:08.888
DEPARTMENT DECIDED TO MAKE ALICE
A LITTLE CHRISTMAS OUTFIT.
SO WHILE THE LIVE SHOW WAS GOING

1:03:08.888 --> 1:03:19.366
ON, THEY TOOK A WOMEN'S JUICY
COUTOUR SWEAT SUIT AND CUT IT UP
AND MADE THIS.

1:03:19.366 --> 1:03:24.938
I REMEMBER THINKING, THIS IS A
REALLY GOOD NIGHT.
THIS IS TV FUN HOUSE,

1:03:24.938 --> 1:03:37.117
CHRISTMASTIME FOR THE JEWS.
AM I ALLOWED TO SAY JEWS?
** TV FUN HOUSE.

1:03:37.117 --> 1:03:43.223
>> ON CHRISTMAS EVE, THE AGAIN
TILES GATHER ROUND THE CHRISTMAS
TREE.

1:03:43.223 --> 1:03:50.864
THEY STAY AT HOME AND PARTY WITH
THEIR FAMILY.
THEY DISAPPEAR ONE DAY EACH YEAR

1:03:50.864 --> 1:03:57.404
AND PASS THE EGGNOG ROUND.
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT BECAUSE
THAT'S THE NIGHT THE JEWS

1:03:57.404 --> 1:04:04.711
CONTROL THE TOWN.
>> WELL, IT'S HAPPENS EVERY YEAR
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

1:04:04.711 --> 1:04:10.784
** ALL THE HAPPY CHRISTIAN
PEOPLE TAKE THEIR LEAVE
** AND THE STREETS ARE DESERTED

1:04:10.784 --> 1:04:20.126

I KNOW IT WASN'T THE CHRISTMAS
SHOW THAT YOU EXPECTED, BUT

1:06:43.636 --> 1:06:49.776
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS PLACE.
LIKE LIFE, IT'S UNPREDICTABLE.
AS MY GOOD FRIEND TOM HANKS ONCE

1:06:49.776 --> 1:06:55.849
SAID IN A MOVIE, LIFE IS A LIKE
A BIG WEIRD CHOCOLATE BAR.
SOMETIMES IT'S DELICIOUS.

1:06:55.849 --> 1:07:01.187
OTHER TIMES IT'S GOT THAT ORANGE
CREAM FILLING IN IT AND IT'S
LIKE, OKAY, IT'S NOT WHAT I

1:07:01.187 --> 1:07:06.259
WOULD HAVE CHOSEN BUT THAT'S
BETTER THAN NOTHING.
I LOVE THAT MOVIE, AND I LOVE

1:07:06.259 --> 1:07:10.030
