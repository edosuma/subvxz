We usually let the parents do

that I have a liver
for their dying child,

Okay.

No, there's no visibility.

disregard for personal hygiene,

05:42.340 --> 05:43.665

put it like that,

05:49.770 --> 05:52.646

- Find her!

after him.

06:11.159 --> 06:13.030
What about Ben?
Can Ben send a rig out

06:13.115 --> 06:14.147
- and look for him?
- Yeah.

06:14.231 --> 06:15.828
He can get him to Seattle Pres
and get him back.

06:15.912 --> 06:18.553
Last time we spoke,
Ben was amputating a foot

06:18.638 --> 06:20.366
in a grounded rig.
So, no.

06:20.451 --> 06:22.115
Dr. Bailey, you asked me

06:25.904 --> 06:26.945
What's the matter with you?

06:27.029 --> 06:29.035
Sorry, there's no medical
reason to keep him.

06:29.119 --> 06:31.054

with Social Services.

06:31.138 --> 06:32.841

06:32.926 --> 06:34.987
Uh, and let me know

in here right now.

06:50.909 --> 06:52.927

06:53.079 --> 06:56.216
Ms. Gutierrez, how are we feeling today?

06:56.380 --> 06:58.631
I called my neighbor,
Stevie,

06:58.716 --> 07:01.705
to check that the heat
is still on in my house

07:01.789 --> 07:05.445
so my cats are okay,
but I worry about the strays.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.705
They don't have wings,
can't just fly south.

07:08.789 --> 07:10.785
You know, freezing to death
isn't supposed to be that bad.

07:12.659 --> 07:14.205
Uh, uh, people, uh,

07:14.289 --> 07:16.575

said it was blissful.

07:16.659 --> 07:18.405
Ms. Gutierrez, if I may,

07:18.489 --> 07:21.124
I saw on TV that the animal
shelters are open 24/7.

07:21.209 --> 07:22.365
There's plenty of food.

07:22.449 --> 07:24.171
People can bring in
any animal that they find.

07:24.255 --> 07:25.945
- Even horses.

I remember. But I'm sure
the ER is slammed.

07:41.489 --> 07:42.655
They could use the help.

07:48.786 --> 07:50.170
Woman on TV: <i>The worst snowstorm</i>

07:50.255 --> 07:52.249
<i>we have ever seen in Seattle.</i>

07:52.334 --> 07:53.342
Woman #2 on TV:
<i>That's right...</i>

07:53.426 --> 07:54.553
Residents
around the region...

07:54.637 --> 07:57.093
I've never seen it
snow like this in Seattle.

07:57.193 --> 08:01.755
Mm, it's not supposed to, but
y'all ruined the planet so...

08:02.833 --> 08:04.756
The social worker said

08:04.841 --> 08:07.952
that you declined to meet
with her about your options.

08:08.982 --> 08:10.655
Mm. I just turned 18.

08:10.739 --> 08:14.115
Which means you can apply
for extended foster care

08:14.199 --> 08:16.530
- or go to a group home.
- Or go out on my own.

08:16.615 --> 08:18.686
Why take the chance on getting
crappy foster parents

08:18.771 --> 08:19.785
just in it for the money?

08:19.869 --> 08:24.945
Because you... you might
get a great family.

08:25.193 --> 08:28.443
People that can help you get
your high-school diploma,

08:28.537 --> 08:29.896
apply for college.

08:29.981 --> 08:32.624
- Uh, help you find
a career you love.

08:32.708 --> 08:34.443
- What?
- Oh. College?

08:34.529 --> 08:35.615
That'll never happen.

08:35.698 --> 08:36.943
I'll just get a job.

08:37.028 --> 08:38.818
There's always a sign
at a Burger Shack.

08:38.904 --> 08:40.654
Joey.

08:40.739 --> 08:42.982
Goodness.

08:43.535 --> 08:46.279
What...

08:47.074 --> 08:48.450
Come on.

08:49.130 --> 08:50.170
You're coming with me.

08:50.255 --> 08:52.655
You are checking out
jobs around here.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.490
I said, come on!

08:56.004 --> 08:57.178
Yes, ma'am.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.255
Hey.
Have you seen my patient?

09:06.340 --> 09:09.397
She's got brown hair
and maybe brownish eyes.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.951
She's about, um...

09:11.329 --> 09:12.405
Well, I don't know
how tall she is.

09:12.489 --> 09:13.834
I... I've only
seen her in bed.

09:14.079 --> 09:16.445
Uh, no, but after you
find her,

09:16.529 --> 09:17.865
why don't we find
an on-call room?

09:17.949 --> 09:19.115
My hip replacement
rescheduled.

09:19.199 --> 09:20.905
Um, yeah, yeah, sure.

09:20.989 --> 09:22.155
May... Uh, maybe.

09:22.239 --> 09:23.445
What? Doesn't sound fun?

09:23.529 --> 09:25.310
Might get snowed in,
make a night out of it.

09:25.395 --> 09:28.034
It does, but we've been
having a lot of fun lately.

09:28.119 --> 09:29.535
In fact, this might be
the most we've talked

09:29.619 --> 09:31.579
since you told me you
weren't out to your parents.

09:33.619 --> 09:36.224
I love you, Nico.
You can talk to me.

09:36.369 --> 09:38.575
You still
haven't found her?

09:38.659 --> 09:41.608
Schmitt, I know this job is hard,

09:41.693 --> 09:43.070
but you should be able
to follow basics like,

09:43.154 --> 09:45.655
don't let a severely
sick patient evaporate.

09:45.739 --> 09:48.326
If she isn't here,
you shouldn't be either.

09:51.449 --> 09:52.982
I have to find my patient.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.967
Hey, more frostbite, bed 10.

09:57.052 --> 09:58.248
Of course there is.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.389
Hey. So, Mom called.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.365
Leo is stir-crazy.

10:01.449 --> 10:02.593
He keeps trying to open
the front door.

10:02.677 --> 10:05.035
But Allison rolled over.
Twice.

10:05.119 --> 10:07.825
No! Wait, did your mom record...
Oh, you know what?

10:07.909 --> 10:09.333
- I don't even know why I
bothered to ask. - Kendra: Help!

10:09.417 --> 10:11.389
Help me, please!
Please help!

10:11.474 --> 10:13.035
It's my wife...
She's not talking.

10:13.119 --> 10:14.785
I don't think she's breathing. Okay,
just stop moving her. Stop.

10:14.869 --> 10:15.995
Let's lay her down.
I got her.

10:16.079 --> 10:16.996
- Alright. Yep.
- Yeah.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.496
- We need a gurney!
- Woman: <i>On it!</i>

10:18.581 --> 10:19.606
She's 32 weeks pregnant.

10:19.691 --> 10:21.081
Why's she hurt?
What happened?

10:21.253 --> 10:22.832
I hit her with my car.

10:29.699 --> 10:32.476
Oh, my God. How far along?

10:32.561 --> 10:34.270
32 weeks. Page OB.

10:34.355 --> 10:35.927
Let's get the X-ray in here,
warm saline,

10:36.011 --> 10:37.754
and where's
the fetal heart monitor?

10:37.839 --> 10:39.872
- Is she dead?
- We need to do a full exam.

10:39.956 --> 10:41.145
Kendra, are you hurt?

10:41.230 --> 10:42.754
No, no, I'm just c-cold.

10:42.839 --> 10:44.271
Alright, let's get her
a warming blanket.

10:44.355 --> 10:46.458
Her back's been hurting her,
and I was snowed in at work,

10:46.542 --> 10:47.716
and she called and said
that she was worried

10:47.800 --> 10:49.017
that she might be having
contractions.

10:49.101 --> 10:51.326
And she wanted to come here.
We only live four blocks away.

10:51.410 --> 10:53.160
- She was walking here?
- I told her not to go,

10:53.244 --> 10:54.410
but I-I got in my car.

10:54.495 --> 10:58.246
I was almost home, and that's
when I-I hit something.

10:58.331 --> 10:59.567
And I got out, and...

10:59.651 --> 11:02.067
I'm gonna be sick.
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

11:02.151 --> 11:04.621
Fetal heartbeat's strong.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.902
- Tube's good.
- Kendra: I thought

11:05.986 --> 11:07.395
I was driving on the street.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.590
I was on the sidewalk.

11:12.285 --> 11:14.864
Tess: ...and then,
under direct visualization,

11:14.949 --> 11:16.325
we remove the ports.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.168
At which point we...

11:18.253 --> 11:19.887
Uh, deflate the abdomen

11:19.972 --> 11:22.285
and close the fascia
with U stitches.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.739
Great.
So... you ready?

11:26.824 --> 11:28.926
Uh, why wouldn't
I be ready?

11:29.011 --> 11:30.972
Oh, my mistake.
I didn't realize

11:31.058 --> 11:33.981
that you had already
performed a lap chole.

11:34.104 --> 11:36.011
Performed one?
Of course not.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.356
Wait, you don't
want me to...

11:38.441 --> 11:39.707
No, I-I...

11:39.792 --> 11:40.848
I can't.
I'm not ready.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.129
Do you know how many
of your classmates beg

11:43.214 --> 11:45.160
to do procedures
when they're not ready?

11:45.245 --> 11:47.105
By the way you formed
the question,

11:47.214 --> 11:48.614
I assume it's
a big number.

11:48.699 --> 11:50.645
I'm not gonna leave you
on your own, Desmond.

11:50.730 --> 11:51.770
You'll be my hands,

11:51.855 --> 11:53.513
but I will guide you through
the whole thing,

11:53.597 --> 11:54.857
step by step.

11:58.435 --> 12:02.183
Have you ever wanted something
with your whole being,

12:02.535 --> 12:05.395
but there are so
many obstacles

12:05.480 --> 12:06.910
it seems like you
won't get it?

12:06.995 --> 12:08.832
So you try to stop dreaming,

12:08.917 --> 12:10.910
but you can't make
yourself stop,

12:10.995 --> 12:15.687
so you just live with it,
quietly in hell?

12:15.863 --> 12:18.215
Let's show your classmates
what you're made of.

12:20.386 --> 12:23.215
Yeah. So, uh,
Ruben's a phlebotomist,

12:23.300 --> 12:26.121
draws blood for lab work,
never leaves a bruise.

12:26.206 --> 12:29.106
And Pablo,
he's a respiratory therapist...

12:29.191 --> 12:31.647
He oversees ventilators
on patients

12:31.731 --> 12:35.753
and, um, helps them if they
have any lung issues. Right.

12:35.847 --> 12:37.668
So should you...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:37.753 --> 12:38.687
Schmitt! Slow down!

12:38.771 --> 12:40.993
Huh? What's the problem?
Uh, nothing. No problem.

12:41.078 --> 12:42.441
All good.

12:43.292 --> 12:44.687
I lost a patient.

12:45.105 --> 12:46.739
I mean, physically.
I can't find her.

12:48.271 --> 12:49.981
If this story doesn't
have a happy ending,

12:50.066 --> 12:51.825
neither will your career.
Understand?

12:51.910 --> 12:53.871
Yep. I'm just gonna...

12:55.208 --> 12:56.414
Can I have his job?

12:56.561 --> 12:58.067
Losing people?

12:58.152 --> 12:59.550
You're not funny.

13:00.378 --> 13:02.267
Hayes: Think this shunt
will stop the bleeding?

13:02.389 --> 13:04.802
Meredith: Well, it's our only
choice until the liver gets here.

13:04.886 --> 13:07.300
So, you were fired.

13:08.417 --> 13:09.857
And?

13:10.074 --> 13:13.098
And I never heard the full
story, and we have time to kill.

13:15.542 --> 13:17.980
I had a 4-year-old patient,

13:18.081 --> 13:20.307
and she did not have
health insurance,

13:20.519 --> 13:22.981
so I put my daughter's name
on her paperwork

13:23.066 --> 13:25.691
- so that I could save her life.
- That's insane.

13:25.995 --> 13:27.536
Well, if you had seen
how sick she was...

13:27.620 --> 13:29.410
No, this country's
medical system is insane

13:29.495 --> 13:31.216
that you had to do that.

13:31.464 --> 13:33.293
I'd do it for more people
if I could,

13:33.378 --> 13:35.647
but then they would definitely
take away my license.

13:35.731 --> 13:39.270
Hmm. Never seen such an
early case of cirrhosis before.

13:39.355 --> 13:41.606
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin
deficiency.

13:41.691 --> 13:43.637
Elisa's older sister
died of the same thing.

13:43.722 --> 13:46.207
Family's first doctor diagnosed
it from the autopsy.

13:46.517 --> 13:47.917
O.R. Nurse:
That was Seattle Pres.

13:48.042 --> 13:49.684
Dr. DeLuca just left
with the donor organ.

13:49.769 --> 13:51.477
- On foot?
- No idea.

13:54.191 --> 13:55.887
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin
deficiency.

13:55.972 --> 13:57.473
Was their first doctor
Alex Karev?

13:57.558 --> 13:59.647
My absentee co-chief?
Yes, it was.

14:00.152 --> 14:03.114
I think I remember her.
She loved comic books.

14:03.199 --> 14:05.410
He did a whole thing for her
on the PEDS floor.

14:05.495 --> 14:06.950
He was devastated
when she died.

14:07.035 --> 14:09.397
Well, not devastated enough
to come back and help Elisa.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.403
Yang spoke a lot
about Karev.

14:11.488 --> 14:13.060
She used to call him
the devil or something?

14:13.144 --> 14:15.785
Evil Spawn.
0 Evil Spawn. That was it.

14:17.049 --> 14:18.777
What did Yang
say about me?

14:19.768 --> 14:21.476
Nothing that I can recall.

14:22.277 --> 14:23.691
Hmm.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.199
No.

14:48.419 --> 14:51.160
No, no, no, no, no, no!

14:51.245 --> 14:53.340
Stop! Everybody.
Oh, my God, stop.

14:53.425 --> 14:55.271
Schmitt?! What if we'd have
been in mid-dissection?

14:55.355 --> 14:56.826
You could've startled
Dr. Desmond so badly

14:56.910 --> 14:58.309
she'd injure
the common bile duct.

14:58.394 --> 15:00.105
Dr. Desmond?
Who's that?

15:00.230 --> 15:01.543
She may not have
been your year,

15:01.628 --> 15:03.779
but, Schmitt, that's no excuse
for not knowing who she is.

15:03.863 --> 15:06.262
That's my patient,
Tess Anderson!

15:07.601 --> 15:09.722
Your patient?
Now, that's absurd.

15:09.886 --> 15:11.147
I can explain.

15:11.231 --> 15:13.325
Am I, um, technically
a-a patient?

15:13.410 --> 15:15.451
Yes. But you were the one
that brought me into the OR.

15:15.535 --> 15:17.052
I was just gonna stay
in the skills lab,

15:17.136 --> 15:19.267
but you told me to be
confident, and I also...

15:21.061 --> 15:22.543
Oh, not again!

15:22.628 --> 15:23.897
Ohh!

15:23.981 --> 15:25.472
Hey! Stop!

15:26.268 --> 15:27.824
God in heaven.

15:29.706 --> 15:31.401
Hey, Pierce!
Pierce, Pierce, here!

15:31.486 --> 15:33.417
I want you to meet,
uh, Joey Phillips.

15:33.502 --> 15:36.660
He is experiencing my version
of a career fair.

15:36.745 --> 15:39.004
Joey,
this is Dr. Maggie Pierce.

15:39.089 --> 15:41.973
Just like Avery,
she is chief of her own department,

15:42.058 --> 15:44.333
cardiothoracic surgery.
Well, technically, I'm cochief, right?

15:44.417 --> 15:47.075
I was the chief, but then
I kind of got demoted.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.832
After you quit and got rehired
out of the goodness of my heart.

15:50.917 --> 15:54.582
Which is why it is such
an honor to be co-chief,

15:54.667 --> 15:55.903
and I'm so proud.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.847
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Maggie. Mom's in P.E.A.

15:57.931 --> 15:59.637
Okay, come on, come on.

15:59.721 --> 16:02.426
Okay. We lost her pulse.
Did we get OB?

16:02.511 --> 16:04.317
They got swamped with
an abruption upstairs.

16:04.402 --> 16:05.395
Give me that ultrasound.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.598
Bailey:
You know what, Joey?

16:06.683 --> 16:08.619
We should go check out
a calmer department.

16:08.704 --> 16:09.628
Is she gonna be okay?

16:09.713 --> 16:10.903
The rib must've
punctured her heart.

16:10.987 --> 16:12.434
Damn it.
Fetal heart rate's down to 80.

16:12.518 --> 16:13.636
I think we're out of time.

16:13.721 --> 16:15.636
Time for what?
Use words. You're not using words.

16:15.720 --> 16:16.726
Am I losing them both?

16:16.811 --> 16:17.928
Bailey: I'm sorry,
what's your name?

16:18.012 --> 16:19.348
Kendra.
I'm Kendra.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.099
Kendra, okay, they need
to do a C-section.

16:21.184 --> 16:22.292
But she's only 32 weeks.

16:22.377 --> 16:24.800
Yeah, but her heart has been
stopped for too long,

16:24.885 --> 16:27.300
and if they don't deliver the
baby now, it'll be too late.

16:27.385 --> 16:29.253
And then they'll
help Lesley?

16:29.338 --> 16:30.464
Uh, I'm afraid...

16:30.549 --> 16:32.118
Let's get a lap
and a thoracotomy tray.

16:32.203 --> 16:33.887
We're gonna do a C-section
and a thoracotomy.

16:33.971 --> 16:36.066
- Both?
- Hunt, she will lose way too much blood.

16:36.151 --> 16:37.972
We can give her more.
We're saving them both.

16:38.057 --> 16:39.652
Mom and baby, okay?

I just... I can't shake it.

25:39.801 --> 25:41.225
It's the first thing
that went through my mind

25:41.309 --> 25:43.044
when I heard that Amelia
was pregnant.

25:43.129 --> 25:44.795
W-Why... Why do you
think that is?

25:44.880 --> 25:47.130
- Because I'm broken, maybe?
- Ah.

25:49.090 --> 25:52.223
'Cause I can't trust that things
will work out 'cause...

25:53.427 --> 25:55.513

I'm afraid that...

That he'll always
be in love with Amelia.

25:58.150 --> 26:00.476
That's a terrible feeling,

26:00.561 --> 26:01.740
thinking somebody
you're in love with

26:01.824 --> 26:03.200
is pining
for someone else.

26:03.426 --> 26:06.551
I mean... trust me, I know.

26:06.636 --> 26:08.922
But, hey...

26:09.170 --> 26:10.426
Come on. I...

26:10.511 --> 26:12.200
I've seen Owen with you.

26:12.936 --> 26:14.669
That man's clearly
in love with you.

26:14.754 --> 26:17.770
It's seeping out of his
ruddy little pores.

26:17.855 --> 26:19.721
Trust me,
I'd be the first one

26:19.806 --> 26:21.270
to tell you otherwise.

26:26.109 --> 26:27.815
Mm.

26:28.205 --> 26:29.781
You're a good man, Tom.

26:29.912 --> 26:31.528
Oh, God.

26:31.613 --> 26:34.069
You're the only person here
who thinks that.

26:34.747 --> 26:38.176
I-I know people
dislike me.

26:38.261 --> 26:39.575
Strongly.

26:39.660 --> 26:42.864
And I know I don't show it,
but, uh, I think I hate it.

26:43.217 --> 26:45.778
And... they're all
part of a club,

26:45.863 --> 26:48.609
and they won't
have me join.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.240
And I've been trying
for two years.

26:51.576 --> 26:52.952
Well,
I don't dislike you.

26:53.037 --> 26:54.145
Hmm.

26:54.230 --> 26:55.896
I'd even say I like you.

26:57.448 --> 26:58.483
Hm.

26:58.614 --> 27:00.860
A lot.
Hmm.

27:00.945 --> 27:02.262
Hmm.

27:02.362 --> 27:04.868
- What are you doing?
- What?

27:04.953 --> 27:06.747
Oh, that look, I...
That look is...

27:06.832 --> 27:08.645
No, there's no look!
You always have a look.

27:08.730 --> 27:10.106
No. No look.

27:10.191 --> 27:11.489
Oh.
There's no look.

I can't stress this enough...

The next 12 hours
are critical.

30:22.390 --> 30:24.015
- Thank you.
- Thank you. -Mm-hmm.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.053
I'm not really in the mood
for visitors.

30:26.186 --> 30:30.170
Andrew, that little girl
is alive because of you.

30:30.255 --> 30:32.202
So I just wanted
you to know that.

30:32.287 --> 30:33.636
I do know that.

30:33.721 --> 30:35.984
And I also know that
if you'd had it your way,

30:36.069 --> 30:37.273
I wouldn't have
gone out there,

30:37.358 --> 30:38.576
and that little girl
would be dead.

30:38.660 --> 30:41.366
So I guess you're thanking me
for not listening to you.

30:42.584 --> 30:45.617
Andrea, we were just
worried about you.

30:47.256 --> 30:51.109
Okay, this is just
like when Papa...

30:51.194 --> 30:53.742
I'm not him, okay?!
I'm not him!

30:53.827 --> 30:55.593
For the first time
in my career,

30:55.678 --> 30:57.847
I'm succeeding on my own,
without anybody's help.

30:57.931 --> 31:00.137
Why can't you just be happy
for me and accept that?

31:00.221 --> 31:01.907
Why... Why... Why you do
you always got to accuse me

31:01.991 --> 31:04.398
- of... of not being well?
- Because there's a history...

31:04.483 --> 31:06.079
Okay, well I don't accuse you
of having Alzheimer's

31:06.163 --> 31:08.061
every time
you forget something, do I?

31:09.431 --> 31:10.618
You know, you can go,
Meredith.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.217
Please, just...
Just leave.

31:27.321 --> 31:30.242
Sorry. I had
a couple of fires to put out.

31:30.327 --> 31:31.827
That's a chief's job.

31:33.163 --> 31:34.476
Did the baby's mom
make it?

31:34.576 --> 31:37.362
She did.
Lesley's in the ICU.

31:37.828 --> 31:39.272
Was that woman right?

31:39.420 --> 31:41.194
This doesn't
usually happen?

31:41.350 --> 31:44.077
It definitely does not.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.789
That might have been the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

31:48.725 --> 31:50.100
Me, too.

31:56.795 --> 31:58.671
Hey, c-come home with me.

31:58.756 --> 32:00.097
With my family.

32:00.428 --> 32:02.460
What?
Come to my house.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.413
Stay while you finish
high school,

32:04.498 --> 32:06.257
while we fill out
your college applications.

32:06.341 --> 32:10.374
And after you've been
away at school,

32:10.459 --> 32:13.101
come back and eat
Thanksgiving dinner

32:13.193 --> 32:14.742
and... and do your
laundry.

32:14.827 --> 32:17.850
And maybe talk about
what career you want.

32:18.595 --> 32:20.466
Look, I don't need money
from the county.

32:20.551 --> 32:22.257
That's not what
this is about.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.347
I have an extra room,
extra food,

32:25.724 --> 32:28.550
extra... love to give.

32:28.721 --> 32:30.097
I...

32:30.241 --> 32:32.717
I have a son who loves
to play video games.

32:32.801 --> 32:39.342
And a husband who... will
understand eventually.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.396
You're serious?

32:42.511 --> 32:44.991
When have you known me
to not to be serious?

32:46.917 --> 32:48.694
Yeah.

32:48.850 --> 32:51.726
Yeah.
I'd like that.

32:51.811 --> 32:53.717
You...

32:54.037 --> 32:56.016
Okay. Yeah.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.079
Okay.

32:59.761 --> 33:01.181
Alright.

33:04.193 --> 33:07.806
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

33:13.011 --> 33:14.553
Hi.

33:19.569 --> 33:21.936
I've seen her,
sweetheart.

33:22.841 --> 33:25.530
I've seen our little girl.

33:26.108 --> 33:28.428
And she is...

33:29.897 --> 33:31.597
she is so you.

33:42.601 --> 33:43.952
Can I give this to you?

33:44.037 --> 33:45.074
Thank you.

33:45.221 --> 33:46.832
Maggie, I have
a favor to ask you.

33:46.917 --> 33:48.147
Sure...

33:49.499 --> 33:51.846
I know that Amelia just took
some personal time.

33:51.931 --> 33:53.766
And I know that Link is having
a terrible time with it.

33:53.850 --> 33:55.553
And I... I know that

33:55.655 --> 33:58.054
I have this feeling
that I can't shake,

33:58.139 --> 34:00.459
but has something to do
with Owen.

34:01.551 --> 34:03.101
I know that you're
Amelia's sister,

34:03.186 --> 34:04.781
and that your allegiance
is to her,

34:04.866 --> 34:06.515
and I deeply respect that.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.547
And I'm not asking you to tell me
everything that you know,

34:08.630 --> 34:10.202
but I am asking you...

34:10.686 --> 34:11.806
Am I crazy?

34:11.891 --> 34:15.614
Am I seeing things that...
That... that aren't there?

34:19.105 --> 34:20.605
You're not crazy.

34:35.353 --> 34:37.938
- Hey.
- Ah.

34:38.935 --> 34:40.920
Uh, the rigs got the all-clear,
so I just...

34:41.005 --> 34:45.014
We just dropped off the guy
with the amputated foot.

34:45.777 --> 34:48.350
Uh, JJ gave birth at the station
in the bathroom.

34:48.443 --> 34:49.710
Wow, that's, um...

34:49.802 --> 34:52.052
But she's good.
She's good, and the baby's good.

34:52.137 --> 34:53.875
So...
I'm sorry, Vic.

34:54.418 --> 34:56.637
I'm... Look, I'm sorry
we had our first fight.

34:56.721 --> 34:58.122
I'm sorry I...

34:58.820 --> 35:00.240
God, I'm too tired
to remember.

35:00.325 --> 35:02.263
But I... I am sorry.

35:03.761 --> 35:05.347
I'm sorry, too.

35:05.685 --> 35:07.224
It was stupid.

35:07.436 --> 35:09.311
I'm pretty sure
I was stupid, but...

35:09.396 --> 35:10.286
- Not touching that.
- Yeah.

35:10.371 --> 35:12.657
I know better than that.

35:12.742 --> 35:14.529
- Meet you at your place?
- Yeah.

35:14.614 --> 35:15.608
We could have
our second fight.

35:15.693 --> 35:17.232
Oh, it's too soon.

35:23.907 --> 35:25.756
Find your patient?

35:25.841 --> 35:28.412
Yeah, and she got to do
more medicine than I did

35:28.497 --> 35:30.427
because she impersonated
a surgeon.

35:30.511 --> 35:32.185
She could have
killed somebody.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.926
Nico, you're silencing me
with sex.

35:41.011 --> 35:44.708
And it's really amazing sex,
but it's becoming all we do.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.686
And I understand if
you're not ready

35:47.771 --> 35:49.888
to talk about your parents.

35:50.034 --> 35:53.271
But I want a relationship,.

35:53.458 --> 35:54.858
Not an impersonation

35:54.943 --> 35:56.944
And this...
it doesn't feel real.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.307
Okay, look.
Uh, Levi...

35:59.560 --> 36:02.427
I'm not you.

36:02.511 --> 36:04.847
I don't like talking
about feelings,

36:04.931 --> 36:06.217
I don't like to "dive deep."

36:06.301 --> 36:09.677
I like to show up
and just... be together.

36:09.825 --> 36:12.557
And I accept all
your feelings talk

I accept you.

I don't try to change you.

36:19.029 --> 36:21.552

Don't go.

36:37.622 --> 36:38.387

Jo?

I'm sorry.

He left me.

escape his life and me.

39:18.341 --> 39:19.849
I called his mom.
