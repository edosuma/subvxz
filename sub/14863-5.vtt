WEBVTT

00:01.789 --> 00:04.927
I am, uh, rusty with the small talk.

00:04.927 --> 00:06.677
And I don't go on a lot of blind dates.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.375
"I think there was some
confusion last night.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.104
Here is a labradoodle for your ref... "

00:10.557 --> 00:11.721
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:19.397 --> 00:20.831
I can't talk right now.

00:20.865 --> 00:23.067
I was supposed to be a mother by now.

00:23.101 --> 00:24.935
I may never have that chance again.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.600
How was your day?

00:28.625 --> 00:30.250
Uneventful.

00:30.250 --> 00:33.720
I walk by a table of men.
I feel them wanting me.

00:33.754 --> 00:34.888
What's your name?

00:34.922 --> 00:36.856
I'm Jennifer.

00:36.891 --> 00:39.793
It's not that I don't
think you're adorable. I do.

00:39.827 --> 00:42.295
That whole wet-nose
thing... I can't get enough.

00:42.524 --> 00:43.925
It's just not practical.

00:45.131 --> 00:47.300
You think you're gonna break me, hmm?

00:47.334 --> 00:49.735
Really? 'Cause you won't.

00:49.769 --> 00:54.073
My heart is made of
stone, my friend... Stone.

00:54.107 --> 00:56.197
Okay, the truth is I would keep you.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.644
It's just that my sister... she's mean.

00:58.669 --> 01:00.203
Stop badmouthing me to that dog.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.428
You're the one that's allergic.

01:01.827 --> 01:03.148
Hey, little puppy.

01:03.571 --> 01:05.316
Hi.

01:05.351 --> 01:07.485
Why are you all pretty?

01:07.520 --> 01:08.787
It's like the middle of the night.

01:08.822 --> 01:10.455
It's 7:30.

01:10.825 --> 01:12.260
Harry and I have a gig later.

01:12.313 --> 01:14.147
As a matter of fact, I should get going.

01:14.182 --> 01:16.049
Hey, will you drive me
to Calabasas tomorrow?

01:16.084 --> 01:17.714
I have a bunch of
depositions, and I'm still

01:17.739 --> 01:19.939
not totally comfortable
driving myself on the freeway.

01:19.964 --> 01:21.264
Yeah. Sure, no problem.

01:23.929 --> 01:25.541
Oh, who's Zack Kilmer?

01:25.566 --> 01:26.899
Oh. Give me that.

01:27.679 --> 01:28.742
Hello.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.435
Hey. Guess where I just was.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.294
Mm, the yoga class I was telling you about?

01:32.534 --> 01:33.767
Never gonna happen.

01:34.201 --> 01:36.892
I was at that beach that
we drove past last Sunday.

01:36.938 --> 01:38.671
- The one in Malibu?
- Yeah.

01:38.696 --> 01:40.330
I was feeling kind of stressed-out.

01:40.399 --> 01:42.033
So I took your advice

01:42.058 --> 01:44.926
and walked around until the sun went down.

01:45.212 --> 01:47.513
Of course, I was listening
to punk rock the whole time.

01:48.715 --> 01:49.752
Uh, which reminds me...

01:49.777 --> 01:51.650
you remember those
tickets that you bought me?

01:51.684 --> 01:53.652
- The red hot chili peppers?
- Yeah.

01:53.686 --> 01:55.289
Yeah, well, the concert's tomorrow night,

01:55.314 --> 01:57.662
and my buddy just bailed.

01:58.028 --> 02:01.130
I don't know if you're
into the band, but, uh...

02:01.360 --> 02:05.330
but if you want to go,
I have an extra seat.

02:07.421 --> 02:09.639
Never mind. Uh, bad idea.

02:09.664 --> 02:11.633
- No, I'd... I'd like to go.
- Really?

02:11.695 --> 02:12.829
Yeah.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.135
Cool. Uh, pick you up at 7:00?

02:16.416 --> 02:17.883
Sounds good. See you then.

02:17.908 --> 02:20.210
What? See who? When? How? What?

02:20.235 --> 02:21.711
I thought you were running late.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.551
Oh, my God. You have secrets.

02:27.884 --> 02:30.186
Gossip. Gossip.

02:37.118 --> 02:38.750
Okay, tell me everything.

02:39.795 --> 02:41.594
Okay, this is gonna sound strange,

02:41.629 --> 02:44.465
so I really need you to keep an open mind.

02:44.892 --> 02:46.250
Zack is the guy from the accident.

02:46.275 --> 02:47.429
He was driving the other car.

02:47.454 --> 02:49.159
He came to visit me a couple of weeks ago.

02:49.184 --> 02:53.175
Wait. Whoa. What? And
you didn't tell me this?

02:53.200 --> 02:54.341
There was nothing to tell.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.675
He wanted to talk about the accident,

02:55.710 --> 02:57.343
and so we talked about the accident,

02:57.377 --> 02:59.596
and I've been speaking to him on the phone.

02:59.621 --> 03:02.018
- And in person.
- No, just a few times.

03:02.043 --> 03:04.717
We've actually, like, become friends.

03:04.751 --> 03:07.220
Friends? I don't...
Savi, how does this work?

03:07.254 --> 03:08.860
We're talking about the
guy that almost killed you.

03:08.885 --> 03:11.190
And I'm the girl that almost killed him.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.892
Honey, is that why you've been so M.I.A.?

03:12.926 --> 03:14.560
You've canceled on two
girls' nights this week,

03:14.594 --> 03:16.094
and April said she's been calling

03:16.128 --> 03:17.894
and leaving messages, and you
haven't returned any of them.

03:17.919 --> 03:20.039
No, no. I've just been really busy at work.

03:20.064 --> 03:21.865
It has nothing to do with Zack.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.101
Can you do me a favor

03:23.135 --> 03:25.270
and not say anything about this to anyone?

03:25.304 --> 03:26.739
Because you know April and Karen...

03:26.773 --> 03:29.074
they're just gonna worry, and I
don't want it to be a whole thing.

03:29.108 --> 03:30.650
Does Dom know you're talking to this guy?

03:30.675 --> 03:32.143
No, I'm working on it.

03:32.554 --> 03:34.812
Hey. Look at me.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.282
Please keep this to
ourselves for right now.

03:37.316 --> 03:39.050
Yeah, sure. No problem.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.151
Thank you.

03:44.497 --> 03:46.327
See? I told you she was weird.

03:49.327 --> 03:50.941
Oh, God.

03:50.966 --> 03:52.099
I can't believe you've never

03:52.124 --> 03:54.024
made mashed-potato volcanoes before.

03:54.089 --> 03:56.658
Playing with food is
kind of against the rules.

03:56.683 --> 03:59.184
Well, we're not playing. We're sculpting.

04:03.454 --> 04:05.488
Go ahead. Dare ya.

04:11.516 --> 04:13.650
All right.

04:16.021 --> 04:18.767
I know I'm not seeing
what I think I'm seeing.

04:18.809 --> 04:20.009
His idea.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.594
It's no reflection on how good the food is.

04:24.629 --> 04:25.990
It's strictly in the name of art.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.832
Yeah.

04:28.866 --> 04:30.801
Yeah. Okay. I've got to go wash my hands.

04:31.110 --> 04:32.142
Okay.

04:33.337 --> 04:34.471
Mwah!

04:37.919 --> 04:40.043
- Mom, I need to tell you something.
- What?

04:40.077 --> 04:41.477
I love Daniel.

04:41.511 --> 04:43.012
Really?

04:43.047 --> 04:44.680
I think I love him, too.

04:44.714 --> 04:46.316
Oh, my God.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.184
Did I just say that out loud?

04:48.218 --> 04:50.438
We both love him! How awesome is this?

04:50.463 --> 04:52.263
Pretty awesome.

04:54.858 --> 04:57.059
Great job tonight.

04:57.093 --> 04:59.962
Oh, yeah. Kitchen's clean.

04:59.996 --> 05:01.229
Leftovers are in the fridge,

05:01.264 --> 05:04.500
although there was not a whole lot left.

05:04.534 --> 05:06.735
Uh, that's because
everybody freaking loved it.

05:06.770 --> 05:08.236
Are you kidding me? Those...

05:08.271 --> 05:10.905
- those chocolate brioche thingies?
- They're good, right?

05:10.940 --> 05:12.140
I think that half of the guests

05:12.175 --> 05:13.708
would have had sex with them if they could,

05:13.742 --> 05:15.877
especially Evelyn, the
one with the cheekbones.

05:15.911 --> 05:17.879
She wants to book us for
next week, by the way.

05:17.913 --> 05:19.047
Well, I can't.

05:19.082 --> 05:20.582
Why?

05:20.616 --> 05:22.351
Because I'm gonna be in Australia,

05:22.385 --> 05:23.986
remember? My family reunion.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.748
- Oh, I thought that was months away.
- Yeah, it was months away.

05:26.773 --> 05:27.630
Now it's tomorrow.

05:27.678 --> 05:29.213
Well, can't you Skype into it or something?

05:29.213 --> 05:30.684
Not exactly how it works.

05:30.709 --> 05:31.843
Josslyn, before I forget,

05:31.868 --> 05:34.441
will you deposit tonight's cha-ching?

05:36.156 --> 05:37.954
Holy check, Batman. What is this?

05:37.979 --> 05:40.636
- This is for more than we asked for.
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.

05:40.661 --> 05:43.085
The party was perfect. My
compliments to the chef.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.777
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:46.074 --> 05:47.142
And to you.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.418
Thank you. This is way too much.

05:49.461 --> 05:53.923
Oh. Big tippers go to heaven.
My mother taught me that.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.673
So basically, it's... it's more of, like,

05:56.707 --> 05:59.209
- a selfish gesture on my behalf.
- Yes, well,

05:59.234 --> 06:01.412
while we appreciate the business, you know

06:01.437 --> 06:03.939
that you don't have to throw
fancy events to see me, right?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.031
I...

06:07.130 --> 06:08.230
Was it that obvious?

06:08.358 --> 06:10.918
Just a hunch. Next time, call me.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:23.233 --> 06:24.697
Did you feel anything?

06:25.202 --> 06:26.773
Shock, I think.

06:26.798 --> 06:29.600
- Anything else?
- I'm still processing the shock.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.427
Okay, think I kind of undershot there

06:32.452 --> 06:34.537
'cause was going for "weak
in the knees" on that one.

06:34.598 --> 06:35.809
Damn.

06:35.834 --> 06:37.801
But I... yeah, I give
you an "A" for effort.

06:37.826 --> 06:39.690
- All right, I'll take it.
- That was good.

06:39.715 --> 06:41.249
I'll take it. And a... a date?

06:41.274 --> 06:43.601
Perhaps maybe you give the guy a break?

06:43.626 --> 06:44.899
Oh, man.

06:45.653 --> 06:47.888
Why not? You get a date.

06:47.913 --> 06:49.880
Okay, all right. I'll take it.

06:52.294 --> 06:54.836
Really great work today, Ted.

06:54.861 --> 06:56.529
I'll see you next week.

06:58.693 --> 07:00.361
Bye.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.015
Tell me, Valerie... What made
you want to teach pilates?

07:57.445 --> 08:00.921
When I started dancing, pilates
was just part of the regimen.

08:00.946 --> 08:04.149
See? I knew you were a dancer. What kind?

08:04.676 --> 08:07.110
Ballet, mostly. A little modern.

08:07.145 --> 08:09.588
I bet you were phenomenal.

08:09.613 --> 08:11.780
Well, I did dance a
pretty mean "Swan Lake."

08:12.115 --> 08:14.582
Of course, that was before my knee injury,

08:14.607 --> 08:17.776
but pilates got me back on... track.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.092
It's great for developing lean muscle.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.693
I can see that.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.340
Join me in my room tonight.

08:35.205 --> 08:36.597
Room 319.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.577
Chloe, a word?

09:05.016 --> 09:06.984
Why wasn't the partners'
meeting on my schedule?

09:07.018 --> 09:10.654
Um, I'm so sorry, but you
weren't asked to that meeting.

09:10.689 --> 09:11.989
I thought it was odd,

09:12.023 --> 09:13.743
so I already checked
with Mitchell's assistant.

09:13.768 --> 09:15.146
Should I ask again?

09:15.171 --> 09:17.638
Um, no. No. No, it's fine.

09:17.939 --> 09:20.219
Uh, I need the Cernik files on my desk.

09:29.517 --> 09:33.820
He cooks. He's a good listener.
He is amazing with Lucy.

09:33.855 --> 09:36.445
It's all just so easy and
effortless and perfect...

09:37.880 --> 09:40.014
Which can't be good, right?
What if it's too perfect?

09:40.049 --> 09:42.517
Or maybe you're due.
You deserve this, April.

09:42.552 --> 09:44.686
Don't look for problems
where there aren't any.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.154
Now, where's Savi?

09:46.188 --> 09:47.779
I need to talk to you guys about something.

09:47.804 --> 09:51.441
I don't know. I left her two
messages, and she never got back to me.

09:52.027 --> 09:53.355
You want to wait?

09:56.364 --> 09:59.830
Okay, so, you know how I've
been trying to date more,

09:59.855 --> 10:03.259
but it's been difficult
because of my... notoriety?

10:03.284 --> 10:04.358
The Google effect.

10:04.383 --> 10:07.485
Exactly. Well, I've
found a way around that...

10:07.793 --> 10:11.217
by going out and meeting
guys as someone else.

10:11.734 --> 10:13.301
Say that again?

10:13.335 --> 10:16.104
I use a different name and
take on a whole new persona.

10:16.138 --> 10:18.306
I've been a preschool teacher named Joan,

10:18.340 --> 10:20.974
a pilates instructor named Valerie.

10:21.009 --> 10:24.576
Oh, once I was Annie, who
owned a boutique in Culver City.

10:24.601 --> 10:26.736
You used me!

10:27.249 --> 10:30.884
Wait. How many times have you done this?

10:30.919 --> 10:32.149
A few.

10:32.379 --> 10:33.679
Like three, four?

10:33.963 --> 10:37.093
Uh, like, somewhere between five and seven.

10:37.524 --> 10:38.624
Maybe nine.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.754
Karen!

10:41.492 --> 10:43.840
Are you sleeping with these guys?

10:43.865 --> 10:46.180
No, I never let it get that far...

10:46.369 --> 10:48.003
Not that I haven't been tempted.

10:48.203 --> 10:51.671
It's been a long time, a really long time.

10:51.706 --> 10:55.266
Anyway, last night, this
banker invited me to his room.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.932
I didn't go.

10:57.048 --> 10:59.015
But you still took the key.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.507
Well, it seemed rude just
to leave it on the bar.

11:01.849 --> 11:05.818
Okay, I don't know much
about this kind of stuff.

11:05.853 --> 11:08.654
And I can tell that
you're having fun, so...

11:08.688 --> 11:10.869
I don't want to be
miss goody-two-shoes.

11:10.894 --> 11:13.003
Do it. Judge me. Rain on my slutty parade.

11:13.028 --> 11:14.294
I'm not judging.

11:14.826 --> 11:18.191
I'm just worried that this
could be a little dangerous.

11:18.330 --> 11:21.701
It's always in a public place,
and I'm never alone with them.

11:22.702 --> 11:24.688
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:25.561 --> 11:28.444
I mean, it's not awesome.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.825
- But it's not like I'm hurting anybody.
- No!

11:32.312 --> 11:34.559
But what happens when
you do want to go further,

11:34.584 --> 11:36.575
whether it's sex or a relationship?

11:36.741 --> 11:38.375
I mean, it might seem harmless now,

11:38.400 --> 11:40.034
but eventually, you'll want more.

11:40.172 --> 11:42.377
And I think, deep down, you
know this can't end well,

11:42.588 --> 11:44.890
which is probably why you're
telling me about it now,

11:44.924 --> 11:47.192
so I can tell you to stop.

11:47.377 --> 11:48.804
Probably.

11:49.228 --> 11:51.399
So... will you?

11:56.321 --> 11:58.789
So, there I am, halfway around
the world in Bhutan, right?

11:58.823 --> 12:00.376
And I've come to live with these monks.

12:00.401 --> 12:02.811
I'm having this spiritual experience.

12:02.836 --> 12:04.608
And this old guy walks
up to me... This monk.

12:04.633 --> 12:05.975
And you have to understand, these guys...

12:06.000 --> 12:07.920
- They say like three sentences a year.
- Right.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.997
He points to his his neck, and he says,

12:10.022 --> 12:11.489
"what can you do about this wattle?"

12:11.721 --> 12:12.988
He did not say "wattle."

12:13.022 --> 12:15.077
Hand to God... he said "wattle." And
then he asked me for a tummy tuck.

12:15.164 --> 12:16.631
Come on. You're making this up.

12:16.656 --> 12:18.690
I made up the tummy-tuck part,
but the wattle part happened.

12:18.715 --> 12:20.380
And then he told me that
he'd pray for me every day

12:20.405 --> 12:22.506
- if I fixed it.
- Well, did you?

12:22.531 --> 12:23.599
Well, yeah, of course. Yeah.

12:23.624 --> 12:24.991
I mean, you can't say no to a monk, right?

12:25.134 --> 12:26.601
Mm. I've said no to plenty of monks.

12:26.635 --> 12:28.970
- Really?
- Yeah. They're kinky.

12:31.973 --> 12:33.107
All right.

12:33.141 --> 12:35.310
All right. You're funny.

12:35.344 --> 12:36.801
Well, why do you sound surprised?

12:36.826 --> 12:37.836
Well, it's... you know...

12:37.861 --> 12:39.439
It's... Most girls that look like you...

12:40.867 --> 12:43.002
They don't need to be
funny, so they're not.

12:43.331 --> 12:45.731
That didn't sound nearly
as sexist in my head,

12:45.756 --> 12:47.096
just so you know.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.599
Yeah, well, I should
introduce you to my ex.

12:49.633 --> 12:51.901
She's prettier and funnier.

12:51.936 --> 12:53.069
"She"?

12:53.103 --> 12:55.805
Didn't we talk about this?

12:57.213 --> 12:58.307
No.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.477
No, you said you'd never been
in a long-term relationship,

13:00.511 --> 13:02.445
- actually.
- Well, it wasn't long,

13:02.470 --> 13:04.571
but it was my longest... almost six months.

13:06.249 --> 13:08.050
That's great. What was she like?

13:09.686 --> 13:11.153
Oh, we don't have to talk about it.

13:11.188 --> 13:13.422
- I'm sorry.
- No. You know what? No. I want to.

13:13.457 --> 13:16.392
- Yeah?
- Yeah. We broke up almost a year ago.

13:16.426 --> 13:19.388
Her name was Alex. She was...

13:19.762 --> 13:21.747
A beautiful person.

13:22.431 --> 13:26.301
And, uh, it wasn't
something I expected, but...

13:27.604 --> 13:29.001
She meant a lot to me.

13:31.608 --> 13:33.108
You loved her.

13:34.611 --> 13:36.111
I did.

13:39.692 --> 13:42.160
Don't look at... Why are
you smiling at me like that?

13:42.194 --> 13:43.586
Because I was right about you.

13:43.675 --> 13:45.977
Oh, yeah? What? What part?

13:46.558 --> 13:48.401
You have a lot of love in your heart.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.102
- Would you like to have dessert?
- Yeah.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.796
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:57.821 --> 13:59.009
Good.

14:00.922 --> 14:02.340
Here we go.

14:02.580 --> 14:03.630
And sauce...

14:03.655 --> 14:06.561
Aah, don't be dripping
that chocolate sauce on me.

14:06.586 --> 14:08.452
- I got it.
- I know what you're trying to do.

14:15.694 --> 14:18.162
I got to pick Lucy up soon,

14:18.187 --> 14:20.646
but you can sleep over again if you want.

14:21.380 --> 14:24.060
Ah, no, I wish I could, but, uh...

14:24.519 --> 14:26.091
I got to catch the red-eye.

14:27.464 --> 14:30.100
You're going back to Vermont tonight?

14:30.345 --> 14:32.139
- Why didn't you...
- I didn't want you to be

14:32.139 --> 14:33.856
thinking about it the whole night.

14:34.210 --> 14:37.242
Your mom's again?

14:37.267 --> 14:39.423
Yeah, the floor guys stained
the wood the wrong color.

14:39.498 --> 14:41.466
It's my fault. I should
have been paying attention.

14:41.491 --> 14:44.626
- I'd leave it, but...
- You want to do right by your mom.

14:44.888 --> 14:47.523
You know, it's the only thing I have left

14:47.557 --> 14:48.758
to honor her memory.

14:50.460 --> 14:53.763
I understand, and...

14:53.797 --> 14:56.087
I think it's sweet.

14:59.112 --> 15:00.746
I'd love to see the place one day. I'm...

15:00.771 --> 15:02.404
sure it's beautiful.

15:04.641 --> 15:06.903
Mnh. Sorry. That was presumptuous.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.476
Oh, I'm glad you want to
see it. It's just that...

15:10.501 --> 15:11.734
It's been a long time

15:11.759 --> 15:14.363
since I've taken a woman
I love back to that house.

15:16.434 --> 15:18.435
What are you saying?

15:20.249 --> 15:22.071
I'm saying...

15:22.897 --> 15:24.331
that I love you, too.

15:27.429 --> 15:28.896
You heard me last night?

15:29.913 --> 15:32.048
I did.

15:32.073 --> 15:33.707
And...

15:36.838 --> 15:38.811
I love you, too.

16:05.206 --> 16:06.611
Hey, Ron.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.814
Why wasn't I included in the
partners' meeting this morning?

16:12.839 --> 16:14.586
Because it was about you.

16:15.210 --> 16:17.805
Look, you and Savi want to
see each other, that's fine.

16:17.830 --> 16:19.798
But it doesn't come without complications.

16:19.971 --> 16:22.557
Somebody already made a
complaint to human resources.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.582
Who?

16:23.597 --> 16:25.880
You know I can't disclose that information.

16:26.365 --> 16:27.833
Then what are the allegations?

16:27.858 --> 16:29.659
I'd at least like to know
what I'm being accused of.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.152
It's perceived that you're
more lenient towards Savi.

16:32.177 --> 16:35.379
Okay. Okay. That perception is 100% wrong.

16:35.664 --> 16:36.898
I don't really care.

16:37.045 --> 16:39.513
Your relationship has become
an issue in this office.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.385
So you're no longer
gonna be supervising Savi,

16:41.410 --> 16:43.496
and she is no longer gonna
be working on your cases.

16:43.521 --> 16:46.157
- Okay, this is ridiculous.
- This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.242
If it continues to be a
problem, one of you will be gone.

16:56.027 --> 16:58.289
Whoo-hoo! That was awesome!

16:58.314 --> 17:00.348
So awesome!

17:00.373 --> 17:01.507
Oh, "Under the bridge"

17:01.532 --> 17:03.432
really brought me back to my senior year!

17:03.901 --> 17:05.468
Hey, are we yelling right now?!

17:05.492 --> 17:08.594
I think so! Should we try talking softer?!

17:08.618 --> 17:10.954
Can you hear me now?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.738
Sorry. You okay?

17:18.873 --> 17:20.440
Yeah, yeah.

17:20.464 --> 17:22.599
- I just... uh...
- I know.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.940
Took me a while to get over that one, too.

17:25.996 --> 17:28.731
I'm still afraid to drive
myself on the freeway.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.679
Well, it's a process. You'll get there...

17:32.112 --> 17:33.480
Eventually.

17:34.309 --> 17:35.519
Hmm.

17:35.553 --> 17:39.018
"Eventually" is really hard for me.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.452
So... what should we do now?

17:42.477 --> 17:44.292
I don't want to go home yet.

17:45.830 --> 17:47.518
So don't.

17:48.024 --> 17:49.578
We can keep this night going.

17:50.598 --> 17:52.015
Yeah?

17:53.802 --> 17:55.270
Okay, let's do it.

17:55.295 --> 17:57.731
Are you up for... anything?

17:59.178 --> 18:01.344
What did you have in mind?

18:11.135 --> 18:14.339
And, uh... Oh, look. This is the bedroom.

18:14.418 --> 18:16.072
Here's the bed. This is the room.

18:16.097 --> 18:18.065
You know, pretty standard stuff.

18:18.427 --> 18:19.445
Hmm.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.485
You give good tour.

18:23.510 --> 18:25.478
Thank you. Should have been a realtor.

18:25.607 --> 18:27.007
I was a realtor.

18:27.041 --> 18:29.767
Really? I knew we had a lot in common.

18:42.957 --> 18:46.008
I cannot believe that I did that.

18:46.033 --> 18:47.706
What... Double doubles at midnight?

18:47.795 --> 18:50.242
No, not that. You know what.

18:50.764 --> 18:51.864
You know.

18:52.104 --> 18:54.205
So, how long am I supposed to keep this on?

18:54.402 --> 18:56.024
Well, at least a couple of hours.

18:57.605 --> 18:58.938
Yep, close enough.

19:02.260 --> 19:05.044
I have ink.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.646
I am such a badass!

19:07.681 --> 19:09.548
- Well, not if you say it.
- Fair enough.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.317
I just feel like a badass.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.687
I feel like I'm marking the
beginning of something new.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.361
I'm glad we did this.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.047
Yeah. Me, too.

19:19.906 --> 19:21.627
I got to tell you something.

19:22.388 --> 19:26.565
My friend didn't just
bail at the last minute.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.534
You never invited anyone.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.880
No, since the accident,

19:31.429 --> 19:34.630
nobody gets what I'm going through, but...

19:35.341 --> 19:38.101
With you, it's... it's easy.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.555
You get it.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.860
I should probably get some rest.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.417
Yeah. Yeah, I should go.

19:46.452 --> 19:50.288
Hey, but, uh, don't forget
to put ointment on it.

19:50.313 --> 19:51.870
I won't.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.790
- Hey, Savi?
- Yeah?

19:55.427 --> 19:57.428
I'm glad we're friends.

19:58.379 --> 19:59.762
Ohh.

20:00.163 --> 20:01.694
Me, too.

20:02.801 --> 20:03.868
Mm.

20:07.472 --> 20:08.538
Fist bump.

20:08.573 --> 20:10.374
Explosion!

20:13.745 --> 20:14.912
Good night, badass.

20:21.152 --> 20:22.987
Hmm.

20:25.322 --> 20:27.257
- Yeah, that was...
- Yeah.

20:33.230 --> 20:36.616
- You could stay if you want.
- No, thanks. I...

20:37.402 --> 20:39.242
I should probably get going.

20:39.366 --> 20:42.000
You should... You should text me, and...

20:42.025 --> 20:44.225
- You blowing me off?
- Ohh.

20:46.298 --> 20:48.265
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

20:48.337 --> 20:50.488
You're...  You're a great guy.

20:50.513 --> 20:52.314
And dinner was... dinner was awesome.

20:52.348 --> 20:54.582
The chemistry was popping, but  that was...

20:54.607 --> 20:56.358
- That was more of a fizzle.
- Right?

20:56.390 --> 20:57.347
- Yeah.
- You agree?

20:57.372 --> 20:59.006
I do. That was our first
time, though, you know?

20:59.031 --> 21:01.331
I feel like if we tried it
again, it would be better.

21:01.356 --> 21:02.941
There's like a learning curve, right?

21:02.966 --> 21:05.672
Yeah, but even with the curve,
it can only get so much better.

21:05.697 --> 21:08.643
You either got it or you don't.
And we don't got it, my friend.

21:08.728 --> 21:10.949
Wow. Reduced to "friend"
while naked is a new one.

21:10.995 --> 21:12.295
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...

21:12.320 --> 21:13.621
I feel like it's not your fault.

21:13.646 --> 21:15.491
- I should apologize, you know?
- Why?

21:15.516 --> 21:17.317
Well, I just wasn't being myself.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.241
Who were you being?

21:19.365 --> 21:22.057
No, I mean I was holding back, you know?

21:22.082 --> 21:23.299
I wasn't giving you my best stuff.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.425
- Scott, it's...
- No, listen. I'm serious.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.598
I have a thing.

21:31.736 --> 21:33.106
What kind of thing?

21:37.963 --> 21:40.765
Holy... Shoes.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.354
What is going on here?

21:45.070 --> 21:48.514
Oh, crap. Are you married?
Because I don't do that anymore.

21:48.539 --> 21:50.006
No, no. I'm not married.

21:50.031 --> 21:51.720
- Girlfriend?
- Very much single.

21:54.652 --> 21:57.616
W... so these... what?
These are your shoes?

21:57.641 --> 21:58.656
Yeah.

21:59.304 --> 22:01.327
- What... what I do...
- Oh.

22:01.619 --> 22:02.920
- Is...
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

22:02.945 --> 22:04.446
- There's no need to explain.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.123
I totally get it.

22:07.148 --> 22:09.187
And you know what? While I appreciate

22:09.260 --> 22:11.361
a man's desire to partake
in some lady accessories...

22:11.396 --> 22:13.397
I do... I don't think
that I can swing that way.

22:13.431 --> 22:15.056
Slow down here for a second.
Pump the brakes. These...

22:15.081 --> 22:17.583
these are my shoes, but I
don't wear them. You wear them.

22:18.393 --> 22:19.475
What?

22:20.435 --> 22:22.160
You wanted to know my thing.

22:23.661 --> 22:24.728
Um...

22:25.208 --> 22:27.117
Having sex with women

22:27.142 --> 22:28.536
while they're wearing designer shoes?

22:28.561 --> 22:31.455
I like sexy shoes on sexy legs,

22:31.480 --> 22:33.561
so I loan these to women that
I sleep with for the night.

22:34.552 --> 22:36.559
Kind of like a bowling alley.

22:36.916 --> 22:38.735
I do have multiple sizes, yeah.

22:39.185 --> 22:40.309
Okay.

22:41.512 --> 22:43.313
So why didn't I get to play?

22:43.652 --> 22:45.742
Because I didn't want to scare you off.

22:46.855 --> 22:49.490
- Does that happen a lot, Scott?
- No.

22:50.033 --> 22:53.436
I didn't lead with my freaky
side because I like you.

22:54.548 --> 22:56.215
I like you a lot.

22:57.743 --> 23:00.818
Well, lucky for you,
I like a little freaky.

23:00.850 --> 23:01.850
Yeah?

23:01.875 --> 23:04.250
Especially if it means I get to wear these.

23:05.771 --> 23:07.146
I get to choose.

23:07.326 --> 23:09.569
Okay. Which ones?

23:09.594 --> 23:11.840
None... For tonight.

23:11.928 --> 23:12.952
Hmm?

23:12.988 --> 23:15.255
I want to date you, but
you have to earn the shoes.

23:29.516 --> 23:31.551
Environmentalists are accusing Congress

23:31.576 --> 23:33.110
of allowing special-interest groups

23:33.135 --> 23:35.336
to erode tougher regulations
for air pollution.

24:02.477 --> 24:04.736
- What can I get you?
- Vodka Martini.

24:29.912 --> 24:32.660
- Do you want to open a tab?
- No, no. Here.

24:55.406 --> 24:56.422
-

24:58.105 --> 24:59.925
Oh, my God.

24:59.950 --> 25:01.418
What's so funny?

25:01.443 --> 25:04.412
Ohh. It's just Scott.

25:04.730 --> 25:07.365
You know, I think there might
actually be something there.

25:07.390 --> 25:09.557
Oh, my... Oh, my sweet Jesus.

25:09.582 --> 25:10.867
What is on your neck?

25:10.892 --> 25:12.159
Uh, do you like it?

25:12.554 --> 25:14.237
Uh, that better be henna.

25:14.669 --> 25:16.971
No, it's real. I got it last night.

25:16.996 --> 25:18.997
What?! With Zack?

25:19.022 --> 25:20.823
Yeah. Will you stop with the crazy eyes?

25:20.848 --> 25:22.433
It's not that big of a deal.

25:22.458 --> 25:23.758
What do you mean, "not
that big of a deal," Savi?

25:23.783 --> 25:24.916
When I got my double ear piercing,

25:24.941 --> 25:26.742
you wouldn't shut up
about it for six months.

25:26.890 --> 25:28.323
You're a lawyer. What were you thinking?

25:28.675 --> 25:31.504
- Lawyers can have tattoos.
- Yeah, edgy lawyers.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.064
No, your idea of edgy is wearing
a wife-beater to brunch...

25:34.089 --> 25:35.155
with a blazer.

25:35.776 --> 25:37.309
Okay, so, if need be,

25:37.343 --> 25:38.996
I can just cover it for work.

25:39.118 --> 25:41.387
Mm. And Dom? What's he gonna think, hmm?

25:41.412 --> 25:43.413
I don't know... maybe that it's sexy?

25:43.472 --> 25:46.606
Sexy that you got a tattoo
with another man. Hmm.

25:46.852 --> 25:48.954
You know, never thought I'd say this,

25:48.988 --> 25:50.889
but you actually worry too much.

25:53.493 --> 25:54.944
Oh, my...

25:57.926 --> 26:00.394
Hey, Karen. It's me. Uh, give
me a call when you get this.

26:00.670 --> 26:02.238
I think I need your help with something.

26:04.704 --> 26:07.338
Karen, I was just about to call you.

26:07.372 --> 26:09.540
Daniel already told you?

26:09.565 --> 26:10.666
Told me what?

26:10.691 --> 26:12.325
That he saw me last night.

26:13.684 --> 26:16.252
But that's not why you
were calling me, is it?

26:16.616 --> 26:18.243
No, I was calling to tell you

26:18.268 --> 26:20.863
that Ryan Gosling came in
this morning and bought a mug.

26:20.888 --> 26:23.356
- Oh! How did he look?
- Perfect, obviously.

26:23.381 --> 26:26.117
Wait. What do you mean you
saw Daniel? He's in Vermont.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.629
He is?

26:27.675 --> 26:29.877
That's weird. It really looked like him.

26:30.067 --> 26:31.267
Was he by himself?

26:32.763 --> 26:34.797
Oh, my God. He was with a woman.

26:34.822 --> 26:38.022
No, no, no, no, the person I
saw was with a bunch of people.

26:38.119 --> 26:40.083
But since that person
probably wasn't Daniel,

26:40.108 --> 26:42.510
- it doesn't matter, anyway.
- Unless it was Daniel,

26:42.535 --> 26:44.469
and he's lying about being in Vermont.

26:44.676 --> 26:46.887
But why would he lie just
to go out with his friends?

26:46.912 --> 26:49.047
He wouldn't. The more I think about it,

26:49.072 --> 26:51.995
I'm sure I'm mistaken. It was pretty dark.

26:52.020 --> 26:54.121
- Well, where were you?
- Starbucks.

26:54.489 --> 26:56.324
It was dark in Starbucks?

26:56.439 --> 26:58.413
The lighting was surprisingly poor.

26:58.989 --> 27:01.113
I'm so sorry I said anything.

27:01.138 --> 27:03.206
Please don't give it another thought.

27:03.231 --> 27:04.865
If Daniel said he was going to Vermont,

27:04.890 --> 27:06.957
I'm sure that's where he is.

27:09.868 --> 27:11.861
You can just put them on my desk. Thanks.

27:12.796 --> 27:14.597
- Hi.
- Hey, where have you been?

27:14.622 --> 27:16.256
I've been trying to reach
you since last night.

27:16.281 --> 27:18.027
Oh, I'm sorry I missed you.

27:18.052 --> 27:20.521
I've been dealing with depos all morning.

27:20.848 --> 27:24.110
- What's going on?
- Um... In my office.

27:24.135 --> 27:25.353
Oh.

27:29.686 --> 27:30.977
We have a problem.

27:31.413 --> 27:32.713
Apparently, someone...

27:32.738 --> 27:35.347
or a few people. I don't
even know, but, um...

27:37.025 --> 27:38.220
There have been complaints,

27:38.292 --> 27:40.326
and you've been taken off all of my cases.

27:40.350 --> 27:41.350
Seriously?

27:41.375 --> 27:42.886
Why?

27:42.911 --> 27:45.561
Well, apparently, uh,
I've been favoring you,

27:45.586 --> 27:47.253
which, obviously, is total crap.

27:47.278 --> 27:49.779
Okay.

27:50.471 --> 27:52.685
What do you... what do you mean, "okay"?

27:52.710 --> 27:56.680
Well, Dom, you have some of
the most labor-intensive cases.

27:56.705 --> 27:59.407
And technically I'm still
only working part-time, so...

27:59.881 --> 28:01.431
I don't know. Maybe it's for the best.

28:01.456 --> 28:02.523
That's not the point, though.

28:02.758 --> 28:04.759
No, I understand that's not the point,

28:04.784 --> 28:08.087
but we're probably not
gonna be able to change it,

28:08.112 --> 28:10.831
so I am making lemonade.

28:11.473 --> 28:13.941
Oh, well, I'm glad you can see
the silver lining in all this,

28:13.966 --> 28:15.932
- but I'm pissed.
- I'm sorry.

28:15.957 --> 28:18.611
I know it's probably worse
for you than it is for me.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.432
But you know what?

28:20.457 --> 28:23.519
Just tell me what you want me
to do, and I'll do it, okay?

28:24.581 --> 28:27.003
Ooh, I am late for my lunch with Karen.

28:27.028 --> 28:28.746
Whoa, now might not be the best time

28:28.771 --> 28:30.372
for you to be taking personal lunches.

28:30.397 --> 28:32.031
Oh, she said it was important, and you know

28:32.056 --> 28:34.622
everything that she's been
going through lately, so...

28:34.647 --> 28:37.515
I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?

29:12.753 --> 29:13.878
Hello?

29:16.051 --> 29:17.718
Hello? Daniel?

29:43.988 --> 29:45.718
What am I doing?

29:49.127 --> 29:51.161
I am so sorry. I'm running late.

29:51.186 --> 29:52.737
I'm on my way right now.

29:56.728 --> 29:58.109
It's open!

30:03.530 --> 30:04.990
Hey...

30:05.245 --> 30:07.124
- Hey.
- Guys.

30:07.921 --> 30:08.921
What's up?

30:09.250 --> 30:11.468
Why don't you come and sit down with us?

30:11.493 --> 30:14.128
O... kay.

30:14.389 --> 30:17.798
You guys are freaking me out.
What's going on right now?

30:18.167 --> 30:20.168
We just... want to talk.

30:20.959 --> 30:23.270
We're worried about you, Savi.

30:35.326 --> 30:36.435
We're your friends.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.388
We just want to know
what's going on with you.

30:38.413 --> 30:41.357
Nothing is going on with me. I'm fine.

30:41.404 --> 30:45.027
In fact, I'm... I'm great.

30:45.129 --> 30:48.692
We're just worried because we
haven't seen you as much lately.

30:48.717 --> 30:50.568
No, I've just been really busy at work.

30:50.593 --> 30:54.007
Not too busy to get a tattoo... with Zack.

30:54.032 --> 30:55.566
Why didn't you tell us about him?

30:58.693 --> 30:59.790
I'm sorry.

31:00.562 --> 31:03.321
I just didn't realize that I'm supposed to

31:03.346 --> 31:05.648
tell you guys everything
that's going on in my life.

31:05.683 --> 31:08.651
Of course you don't. It's
just that, usually, you do.

31:08.686 --> 31:10.495
You tell us when you buy a new loofah.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.083
That's who you are, which
is why we're concerned.

31:13.308 --> 31:15.842
Okay. What do you guys want to know?

31:16.059 --> 31:17.526
What's... what's up with Zack?

31:17.561 --> 31:19.228
For real. Are you sleeping with him?

31:19.262 --> 31:20.715
No, I'm not.

31:21.264 --> 31:23.666
And you're not allowed
to ask any more questions.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.339
He's the guy from the accident, right?

31:26.436 --> 31:28.916
I mean, don't you think that's strange?

31:29.229 --> 31:33.441
I think it sounds a lot
stranger than it actually feels.

31:33.475 --> 31:38.780
But we're weirdly bonded
by this thing that happened

31:38.815 --> 31:40.682
to the both of us, you know?

31:42.318 --> 31:44.720
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

31:44.754 --> 31:47.054
It makes perfect sense to me.

31:47.089 --> 31:50.678
But if it's so innocent,
why aren't you telling Dom?

31:50.759 --> 31:52.893
Because Dom is a guy,

31:52.928 --> 31:54.757
and it will turn into a fight.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.574
And since this thing with Zack

31:56.599 --> 31:58.600
will probably just go away soon, anyway,

31:58.634 --> 32:02.615
I don't feel the need to put
my relationship through that.

32:03.471 --> 32:04.605
I mean, do you?

32:08.436 --> 32:11.357
Look, guys, I know that
I've been going through

32:11.382 --> 32:13.824
a lot of changes since the accident, but...

32:13.849 --> 32:16.493
They're all good changes.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.741
And I'm starting to feel back on track.

32:19.798 --> 32:22.000
- Because of Zack?
- Well, yeah,

32:22.025 --> 32:23.959
but it's... more than that.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.843
I mean, I'm discovering
parts of myself that

32:27.566 --> 32:29.716
were probably always there,

32:29.741 --> 32:33.404
but I was always too afraid
to do anything about them.

32:33.853 --> 32:35.404
You're acting on your impulses,

32:35.429 --> 32:37.764
even when it's outside your comfort zone.

32:37.933 --> 32:40.568
I totally get why you guys are worried,

32:40.759 --> 32:42.876
and  I so love you for it.

32:42.901 --> 32:45.335
Thank you. But, really, I'm fine.

32:47.735 --> 32:50.704
Me too. I'm glad we talked.

32:51.860 --> 32:53.615
Me too.

32:54.154 --> 32:56.892
Now, can I please see this tattoo?

32:56.917 --> 32:58.383
Oh, yeah.

32:58.418 --> 33:00.385
Yes. It's on my neck. See it?

33:02.101 --> 33:04.277
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, wow!

33:04.715 --> 33:06.868
That looks like it really hurt.

33:06.893 --> 33:08.160
It did really hurt.

33:19.239 --> 33:21.540
- You set me up.
- Excuse me?

33:21.565 --> 33:24.850
I don't know how you found out
about me and Savi, but you did.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.089
And then you told me
you had feelings for me,

33:27.114 --> 33:28.775
so Savi and I had to come out.

33:29.002 --> 33:30.368
And why would I do that?

33:30.402 --> 33:32.370
So you could complain to human resources

33:32.689 --> 33:34.323
and get Savi kicked off all my cases,

33:34.348 --> 33:36.982
which, coincidentally, belong to you now,

33:37.016 --> 33:39.661
so we'll be spending
a lot of time together.

33:40.109 --> 33:42.997
Whatever you were hoping
was gonna happen between us,

33:43.560 --> 33:44.669
it won't.

33:45.451 --> 33:49.345
I have no interest in being
your girlfriend, Dominic.

33:49.458 --> 33:52.515
Don't get me wrong...
you're an attractive man.

33:52.561 --> 33:53.828
Then what do you want?

33:53.853 --> 33:55.253
I want what's fair.

33:55.278 --> 33:59.414
Your relationship with Savi is
getting in the way of my career.

33:59.592 --> 34:02.552
Ever since she's back,
I've gotten fewer cases.

34:02.577 --> 34:04.343
No, you've gotten fewer cases

34:04.368 --> 34:06.359
because there's another
lawyer to share the work.

34:06.384 --> 34:08.962
You can lie to yourself all you want

34:08.987 --> 34:11.456
about your fair-minded practices.

34:11.761 --> 34:14.228
But when you're screwing
one of the players,

34:14.254 --> 34:15.989
it changes the game.

34:16.501 --> 34:19.817
I was just leveling the field.

34:19.842 --> 34:21.375
By being a conniving bitch?

34:21.606 --> 34:24.842
Are you gonna talk to me
like that when I make partner?

34:24.976 --> 34:26.817
When you...

34:27.574 --> 34:30.443
Okay, you... you... you still
think you've got a shot in hell

34:30.524 --> 34:34.766
at making partner after
this, so let me be real clear.

34:35.929 --> 34:39.809
As long as I'm at this
firm, that will never happen.

34:39.902 --> 34:40.976
Oh...

34:42.496 --> 34:43.963
It'll happen...

34:44.905 --> 34:47.768
Slow and easy.

34:47.974 --> 34:50.492
It'll be so subtle...

34:51.101 --> 34:52.821
You won't even feel it...

34:55.594 --> 34:59.598
until there's no denying
and there's no turning back.

35:03.923 --> 35:05.655
I hope you're hungry.

35:08.743 --> 35:10.236
If it's Daniel, you can answer it.

35:10.261 --> 35:12.602
If it's not, no cellphones
at the dinner table.

35:12.852 --> 35:14.433
It's Daniel.

35:15.373 --> 35:17.508
- Hello?
- Hey, you.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.123
I'm glad I caught you.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.274
I called earlier, but your phone was off.

35:22.324 --> 35:24.925
I'm so sorry. It's been a crazy day.

35:25.843 --> 35:27.309
How's Vermont?

35:27.406 --> 35:29.017
It's good. It's good. Humid.

35:29.854 --> 35:31.555
I got the floor guys working late tonight,

35:31.580 --> 35:34.191
but they promise me that
they'll get it done soon.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.543
Ain't that right, Frank?

35:37.606 --> 35:39.574
Ask him when he's coming home.

35:39.599 --> 35:41.734
Lucy wants to know when you're coming home.

35:43.423 --> 35:44.741
Just Lucy?

35:45.145 --> 35:46.946
Okay. Me too.

35:48.937 --> 35:53.376
Uh, depends when we finish,
but maybe as early as tomorrow.

35:53.544 --> 35:55.906
- Really?
- I hope so.

35:58.550 --> 36:00.391
I wish I was with you right now.

36:00.632 --> 36:01.841
I miss you.

36:02.215 --> 36:03.690
I miss you, too.

36:04.176 --> 36:06.243
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

36:06.275 --> 36:07.454
Bye.

36:11.225 --> 36:12.325
Who was that?

36:13.228 --> 36:14.707
Just my brother.

36:37.844 --> 36:39.787
-

36:49.128 --> 36:50.452
Hey.

36:56.313 --> 36:58.280
Seriously? The silent treatment?

36:59.663 --> 37:02.298
- Look, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

37:03.413 --> 37:05.983
You told them when I
specifically told you not to,

37:06.008 --> 37:08.230
which is crazy, because
I actually thought that...

37:10.452 --> 37:11.862
You know what? Forget it.

37:11.887 --> 37:13.956
- It's not worth it.
- No, no, no, no. What? Say it.

37:15.095 --> 37:17.859
I actually thought our
relationship had changed.

37:17.889 --> 37:21.824
I told you about Zack
because I trusted you.

37:21.849 --> 37:23.649
Oh, please.

37:23.674 --> 37:25.708
Savi, that's not why
you told me about Zack.

37:26.170 --> 37:28.479
You told me because you
thought that I'd be so excited

37:28.504 --> 37:30.241
that you finally entrusted me with a secret

37:30.266 --> 37:32.367
that I would overlook
how crazy you're being.

37:32.392 --> 37:34.707
But listen to me. I don't
care about keeping your secret.

37:34.732 --> 37:36.112
I care about you, Savi.

37:36.137 --> 37:39.633
Okay, for the last time, I'm fine.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.925
No, you may have fooled Karen and April,

37:41.950 --> 37:44.235
but I know that something
is way, way off here.

37:44.260 --> 37:46.038
You're not discovering sides of yourself.

37:46.063 --> 37:47.822
- You're lying to yourself.
- I don't have to listen to this.

37:47.847 --> 37:49.882
You know what? And more
importantly, you're lying to Dom,

37:49.907 --> 37:52.811
- just like you lied to Harry.
- This conversation is over.

37:52.836 --> 37:53.853
'Cause you know I'm right.

37:53.878 --> 37:57.080
No, because this is my life, okay?

37:57.105 --> 37:58.972
It has nothing to do with you!

37:58.997 --> 38:02.132
Of course it does, Savi! It
has everything to do with me!

38:02.157 --> 38:04.650
Everything that you went through
last year, I was there for you.

38:04.675 --> 38:06.340
I helped you pick up the pieces, remember?

38:06.365 --> 38:08.834
Okay, I'm... I'm really sorry
that it inconvenienced you.

38:08.859 --> 38:11.572
Oh, my God. Don't you
twist my words like that.

38:11.649 --> 38:14.069
It broke my heart watching you
suffer the way that you did.

38:14.094 --> 38:15.804
And... what?... You think
that I'm just gonna stand here

38:15.829 --> 38:18.343
and watch you make the same
mistake over and over again?

38:18.520 --> 38:20.687
You are playing with
fire. I don't know why.

38:20.712 --> 38:22.013
And I don't know how to make you stop,

38:22.038 --> 38:25.243
but you need to know that
what you are doing is risky.

38:25.419 --> 38:27.308
And...

38:28.492 --> 38:29.693
Okay.

38:30.130 --> 38:31.229
Who is that?

38:39.396 --> 38:40.730
Hey, I'm Zack.

38:42.617 --> 38:43.883
Great.

38:48.015 --> 38:49.915
Hey, Zack.

38:50.771 --> 38:52.627
- Am I early?
- No, you're fine.

38:52.652 --> 38:55.388
That's... that's my sister, Joss.

38:55.889 --> 38:57.157
Everything okay?

38:57.182 --> 39:00.084
Ohh, yeah. Everything's fine.

39:00.322 --> 39:02.022
Ready for House of Pies?

39:02.047 --> 39:03.719
I have a better idea.

39:04.199 --> 39:05.500
And I'm driving.

39:12.683 --> 39:15.058
Don't get me wrong. I love Paris.

39:15.105 --> 39:16.739
But not for business.

39:16.764 --> 39:19.001
Paris should be all about pleasure.

39:19.026 --> 39:20.982
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

39:21.007 --> 39:22.628
The food, the wine.

39:22.653 --> 39:25.728
Every time I go, I make
sure to bring a new perfume.

39:25.985 --> 39:29.189
The scent of the city stays
with me until next time.

39:38.637 --> 39:40.705
Why don't we finish this upstairs?

39:42.420 --> 39:44.621
I was hoping you'd say that.

41:05.437 --> 41:07.071
Are you okay?
