12:23.143 --> 12:24.444
I HAD A HORRIBLE DAY AT WORK.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.446
ONE OF THE WORKERS
TRASHED THE FACTORY,

12:26.446 --> 12:28.218
AND WE HAD TO
SHUT IT DOWN.

12:28.218 --> 12:31.221
OH, MY GOD.
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

12:32.883 --> 12:34.454
I´M JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.157
WHAT´S GONNA HAPPEN
TO YOUR MOM?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.329
I DON´T KNOW.

12:39.329 --> 12:41.361
I WANT TO BELIEVE
SHE DIDN´T DO IT, ANGIE,

12:41.361 --> 12:43.193
BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE
POINTS TO HER.

12:43.193 --> 12:44.935
THIS IS JUST PERFECT.

12:44.935 --> 12:47.337
IT´S JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
IN THIS COUNTRY NOW.

12:47.337 --> 12:50.070
YOU´RE GUILTY
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.

12:50.070 --> 12:53.343
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF
THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ACT.

12:53.343 --> 12:56.206
THAT´S ABOUT GAY MARRIAGES.

12:56.206 --> 12:58.378
PICK UP A NEWSPAPER.

13:01.551 --> 13:03.483
YOUR MOM´S HERE.

13:10.921 --> 13:12.823
SO...

13:12.823 --> 13:15.025
DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT THE FACTORY?

13:15.025 --> 13:17.397
YEAH.
I HEARD IT´S A MESS.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.270
SO, HOW DID YOU
HURT YOUR HAND?

13:20.270 --> 13:22.332
OH, I GOT DRUNK
LAST NIGHT.

13:22.332 --> 13:24.404
I FELL.
I SPRAINED MY WRIST.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.506
THAT´S WHY
I DIDN´T COME IN.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.979
REALLY?
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

13:28.979 --> 13:31.311
YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO HURT YOUR HAND

13:31.311 --> 13:34.184
THE SAME DAY THAT SOMEBODY
TRASHED THE FACTORY.

13:34.184 --> 13:35.345
HUH.

13:35.345 --> 13:37.217
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.119
I´M SAYING THAT
YOU WERE MAD AT MEL.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.520
YOU SMASHED THE MICROWAVE.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.323
YOU KICKED BIG BOB
IN HIS HUEVOS.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.356
AND YOU TOLD GINA YOU WERE
GONNA BURN THE FACTORY DOWN.

13:46.356 --> 13:50.260
YEAH, I WAS MAD AT MEL
ABOUT THE POOL.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.062
BIG BOB DESERVED IT.

13:52.062 --> 13:55.835
AND GINA´S JUST MAD BECAUSE
I DON´T DO THE ACEY-DEUCEY.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.007
MOM!

13:59.369 --> 14:03.143
RANDY´S LOCKER
WAS THE ONLY ONE SMASHED.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.375
NOW,
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

14:05.375 --> 14:07.347
[ SCOFFS ]
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.349
THEY JUST NEED
SOMEBODY TO BLAME,

14:09.349 --> 14:10.981
AND I´M THE EASY CHOICE.

14:10.981 --> 14:13.853
LOOK, DO YOU KNOW
HOW SERIOUS THIS IS?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.956
MOM, WE HAD TO SHUT
THE FACTORY DOWN.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.358
PEOPLE ARE GONNA LOSE
THEIR PAYCHECKS.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.560
LOOK, I CAN´T PROTECT YOU
THIS TIME.

14:21.892 --> 14:23.333
GEORGE...

14:23.333 --> 14:25.465
I KNOW THAT
THIS DOESN´T LOOK GOOD.

14:25.465 --> 14:29.569
I DID NOT TRASH THE FACTORY.
WHY CAN´T YOU BELIEVE ME?

14:29.569 --> 14:33.273
BECAUSE YOU´VE LIED TO ME
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.575
YOU SAID THAT
MY DAD WAS DEAD,

14:35.575 --> 14:38.308
THAT I DIDN´T
HAVE A SISTER.

14:38.308 --> 14:41.081
YOU SAID...

14:41.081 --> 14:44.284
THAT THAT PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG
YOU THREW IN THE RIVER

14:44.284 --> 14:47.157
WAS A HAMSTER SUBMARINE.

14:49.359 --> 14:53.323
AND WHEN HIS MISSION WAS OVER,
MR. WINKIE WOULD COME BACK!

14:56.196 --> 14:57.567
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?

14:57.567 --> 15:00.200
THAT I WAS TRYING
TO PUSH HIM BACK IN HIS CAGE

15:00.200 --> 15:01.531
WITH A BARBECUE FORK?

15:01.531 --> 15:03.233
IS THAT BETTER?

15:05.105 --> 15:06.436
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

15:06.436 --> 15:09.039
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?

15:09.039 --> 15:12.242
THAT I WAS DRUNK AND I THOUGHT
HE WAS ONE OF MY HOUSE SLIPPERS?

15:12.242 --> 15:13.944
IS THAT BETTER?

15:13.944 --> 15:16.316
YOU KNOW WHAT --
YOU´VE BEEN LYING SO MUCH,

15:16.316 --> 15:18.949
YOU DON´T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT THE TRUTH IS.

15:18.949 --> 15:21.591
LOOK, EVERYONE AT THE FACTORY
IS SAYING THAT IT´S YOU.

15:21.591 --> 15:23.353
I´M THE MANAGER.

15:23.353 --> 15:27.357
I´M GONNA HAVE TO TELL MEL.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.360
YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO,

15:30.360 --> 15:33.233
BUT I´M GONNA TELL YOU
ONE THING.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.335
I ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR YOU,

15:35.335 --> 15:37.968
NO MATTER WHAT
THEY ACCUSED YOU OF --

15:37.968 --> 15:40.140
BREAKING A WINDOW,
CHEATING ON A TEST.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.571
I DON´T CARE.

15:41.571 --> 15:44.944
I SAID, "HE DIDN´T DO IT,"
BECAUSE YOU WERE MY SON.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.017
NOW, YOU COULD HAVE
KILLED SOMEBODY.

15:47.017 --> 15:51.021
I WOULD HAVE GONE ON THE TV
AND SAID, "HE´S A GOOD BOY,"

15:51.021 --> 15:52.652
EVEN AFTER I HID THE BODY.

15:55.285 --> 15:59.189
SO YOU GO IN,
MR. MANAGER...

15:59.189 --> 16:01.361
AND DO YOUR JOB TOMORROW.

16:09.339 --> 16:11.571
SORRY ABOUT
MR. WINKIE, DAD.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.374
GRANDMA SHOULDN´T HAVE LIED
ABOUT SOMETHING YOU LOVED.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.407
YEAH, YOU´RE RIGHT, MAX.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.381
HEY.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.653
HEY, REMEMBER
WHEN I TOLD YOU

16:23.653 --> 16:26.316
THAT NASA PICKED
YOUR PET SNAKE REUBEN

16:26.316 --> 16:28.588
FOR THAT SECRET
SPACE MISSION?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.360
YEAH.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.292
YOU KNOW, THAT´S...

16:32.292 --> 16:35.495
NOT NECESSARILY WHAT HAPPENED,
YOU KNOW.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.269
I PUT HIM IN THE YARD
TO SUN HIMSELF, AND I FORGOT,

16:39.269 --> 16:43.002
AND I...MOWED THE LAWN.

16:43.002 --> 16:47.037
IF YOU WANT TO SAY GOODBYE
TO HIM, HE´S OVER THERE.

16:49.239 --> 16:51.411
MAX.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.583
AND OVER THERE.

16:55.685 --> 16:57.617
MAX.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.689
AND THERE WAS
SOME RIGHT HERE.

17:02.292 --> 17:05.625
HIS TAIL WAS LIKE THAT.

17:13.063 --> 17:14.564
GEORGE?

17:14.564 --> 17:16.166
YEAH?

17:16.166 --> 17:17.567
THIS IS GONNA BE DIFFICULT,

17:17.567 --> 17:20.470
BUT I KNOW WHO´S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE VANDALISM.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.612
OKAY, LOOK, MEL,
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

17:22.612 --> 17:25.075
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I CAME IN HERE THIS MORNING

17:25.075 --> 17:26.576
FULLY PREPARED
TO FIRE MY MOTHER.

17:26.576 --> 17:30.049
GOOD. IT´S BEEN A LONG TIME
COMING. CONSIDER IT DONE.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.052
LOOK, EVEN THOUGH ALL
THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO HER...

17:34.324 --> 17:36.156
SHE TOLD ME
SHE DIDN´T DO IT, MEL,

17:36.156 --> 17:38.228
AND I´M WILLING TO PUT
MY JOB ON THE LINE

17:38.228 --> 17:40.059
THAT SHE´S TELLING
THE TRUTH.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.462
OF COURSE SHE IS.
MY IDIOT SON DID IT.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.364
WHAT?

17:44.364 --> 17:47.397
YEAH, THE LITTLE SNOT RIPPED UP
THE PLACE JUST TO TICK ME OFF.

17:47.397 --> 17:49.139
WELL, HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE DID IT?

17:49.139 --> 17:51.141
I CHECKED THE HANDWRITING
ON THE GRAFFITI

17:51.141 --> 17:52.602
AGAINST THE
"I HATE YOU, DADDY" THING

17:52.602 --> 17:56.146
HE WROTE
IN THE PSYCHOLOGIST´S OFFICE.

17:56.146 --> 17:58.148
BUT WE´RE STILL FIRING
YOUR MOM, THOUGH, RIGHT?

17:58.148 --> 18:00.079
BECAUSE, BOY, I COULD USE
SOME GOOD NEWS.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.852
NO, THERE´S NO REASON
TO FIRE MY MOM NOW.

18:02.852 --> 18:04.684
HOW ABOUT
THAT CHRISTMAS PARTY

18:04.684 --> 18:07.317
WHERE I GOT DRUNK
AND SHE SHAVED MY LEGS?

18:07.317 --> 18:11.221
IT NEVER GROWS BACK
THE SAME, GEORGE.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.698
LOOK, MEL, I´M NOT GONNA
FIRE MY MOM, AND THAT´S FINAL.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.230
FINE.

18:20.230 --> 18:21.631
THANKS, MEL.
I MEAN, COME ON, MAN.

18:21.631 --> 18:23.703
WOULD YOU FIRE YOUR MOM
FOR SOMETHING SHE DIDN´T DO?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.335
OH-HO, MAN!

18:25.335 --> 18:27.877
I JUST WISH SHE WAS ALIVE
SO I COULD DO IT AGAIN.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.444
THEY´RE ALL IDIOTS.

18:34.444 --> 18:37.687
YOU MAKE A FEW MISTAKES
IN YOUR LIFE,

18:37.687 --> 18:41.521
SOME MISDEMEANORS,
A COUPLE OF ASSAULTS...

18:42.292 --> 18:45.225
A NEW YEAR´S EVE BULLET
FALLS ON SOMEBODY´S DOG,

18:45.225 --> 18:47.397
AND SUDDENLY,
YOU´RE A BAD PERSON.

18:47.397 --> 18:50.660
GRANDMA,
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

18:50.660 --> 18:52.432
YOU CAN´T TELL ANYBODY.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.434
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SHOWING.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.267
HEY, 15 --
YOU BEAT ME BY A YEAR.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.839
NO.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.741
OKAY, I LIKE THIS BOY,

19:01.741 --> 19:04.614
BUT EVERYONE
MISUNDERSTANDS HIM.

19:04.614 --> 19:07.847
THEY THINK HE´S, LIKE,
BAD OR SOMETHING, BUT HE´S NOT.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.750
HE´S REALLY
SWEET AND GENTLE.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.654
SHOULDN´T YOU BE HAVING THIS
CONVERSATION WITH YOUR MOTHER?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.657
WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE DO?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.330
OH, HEY.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.492
AM I FIRED?
NOPE.

19:22.492 --> 19:24.564
YOU´RE STILL HANGING
TO THE SAME THREAD

19:24.564 --> 19:26.796
YOU´VE BEEN CLINGING TO
FOR 36 YEARS.

19:26.796 --> 19:28.338
YOU´RE OFF THE HOOK.

19:28.338 --> 19:30.740
MEL´S SON WAS LOOKING
FOR ATTENTION.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.872
HE TOOK IT OUT
ON THE FACTORY.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.544
ZACK POWERS DID THIS?

19:34.544 --> 19:37.447
HEY, I TOLD YOU
THAT DUDE WAS A CRIMINAL.

19:37.447 --> 19:40.350
GOD HELP THE SKANK
THAT FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM.

19:43.213 --> 19:45.215
I DON´T UNDERSTAND.

19:45.215 --> 19:47.887
I THOUGHT ALL THE EVIDENCE
POINTED TO ME.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.619
I´M OUT OF CONTROL.

19:49.619 --> 19:52.722
I´M THE ONE WHO
KILLS MICROWAVES AND HAMSTERS.

19:52.722 --> 19:54.364
HEY, DON´T GIVE ME
ANY CRAP, MOM.

19:54.364 --> 19:56.226
I WENT IN THERE,
AND I TOOK A STAND FOR YOU.

19:56.226 --> 19:57.727
OH, GET OUTTA HERE.

19:57.727 --> 20:00.830
NO, I STOOD UP FOR YOU, MOM,
AND I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

20:00.830 --> 20:05.635
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,
YOU WERE TELLING THE TRUTH.

20:07.777 --> 20:11.811
WELL, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.346
OKAY, HERE´S THE TRUTH --

20:16.346 --> 20:19.389
I WENT INTO THE FACTORY
YESTERDAY MORNING,

20:19.389 --> 20:21.621
BUT I SAW THE PLACE
WAS ALREADY WRECKED,

20:21.621 --> 20:25.955
SO I FIGURED WHAT THE HECK?
AND I SMASHED RANDY´S LOCKER.

20:25.955 --> 20:28.828
REMEMBER, I WAS MAD AT HIM.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.560
IS THAT HOW
YOU HURT YOUR PAW?

20:30.560 --> 20:31.861
NO, NO.

20:31.861 --> 20:34.564
I DID THIS BREAKING INTO
MEL´S LIQUOR CABINET.

20:34.564 --> 20:37.767
SO, YOU KNOW, I KIND OF
WORKED THAT OUT, TOO.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.410
OKAY,
PLEASE BE FINISHED.

20:40.410 --> 20:41.711
GEORGE...

20:41.711 --> 20:44.314
I AM TELLING YOU THIS
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

20:45.815 --> 20:47.246
WHAT?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.022
OH.

20:53.022 --> 20:55.685
[ SNIFFS ]
THE LIES ARE BACK.

20:55.685 --> 20:59.258
I´M HOME AGAIN.
