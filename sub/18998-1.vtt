00:22.520 --> 00:26.991
Consists of three of
Chaplin's early movies:

00:29.200 --> 00:30.679
A DOG'S LIFE

00:30.880 --> 00:32.359
SHOULDER ARMS

00:32.560 --> 00:33.993
THE PILGRIM

00:35.560 --> 00:38.996
Three silent comedies

00:58.520 --> 01:01.398
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Charlie Chaplin talking.</i>

01:01.680 --> 01:04.194
<i>This is Hollywood,
California in 1915</i>

01:04.400 --> 01:06.516
<i>with its sun-kissed oranges
and lemon groves,</i>

01:06.720 --> 01:09.678
<i>before it was visited
by the 3 horsemen of the apocalypse:</i>

01:09.880 --> 01:11.791
<i>Oil, movies and aeronautics,</i>

01:12.040 --> 01:14.474
<i>who strolled the earth uprooting
the orange and lemon trees,</i>

01:14.680 --> 01:17.399
<i>and in their stead built factories
and motion picture studios.</i>

01:18.440 --> 01:19.634
<i>I was one of the offenders.</i>

01:19.840 --> 01:21.319
<i>I wanted a studio in a hurry.</i>

01:21.520 --> 01:23.238
<i>In the States,
they do things in a hurry.</i>

01:23.440 --> 01:24.668
<i>And, as if by magic,
I got it.</i>

01:25.720 --> 01:27.950
<i>This is not Stratford-on-Avon,
Shakespeare's birthplace.</i>

01:28.600 --> 01:30.875
<i>Believe it or not,
this is a motion picture studio.</i>

01:31.600 --> 01:33.556
<i>Now you see my arrival, that's me.</i>

01:34.360 --> 01:35.952
<i>I look much younger there.</i>

01:36.160 --> 01:38.310
<i>That was taken
at least 10 years ago.</i>

01:39.360 --> 01:40.873
<i>Now let me take you backstage.</i>

01:41.080 --> 01:43.310
<i>In those days I never worked
with a scenario.</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:45.829
<i>It started with an idea
and developed on the set.</i>

01:54.560 --> 01:57.597
<i>This is Miss Edna Purviance,
my leading lady.</i>

01:58.160 --> 02:00.958
<i>She's put on a little weight during
the building of the studio.</i>

02:06.080 --> 02:07.479
<i>In the next scene,
we ran into trouble.</i>

02:07.680 --> 02:09.636
<i>We must have rehearsed it 50 times.</i>

02:25.240 --> 02:28.357
<i>On the 32nd take the little fellow
became quite a dead weight.</i>

02:28.840 --> 02:31.149
<i>It was very trying on the muscles
of my arms.</i>

02:33.880 --> 02:36.952
<i>So now let me take you back
to the good old silent days.</i>

02:37.160 --> 02:39.754
<i>There will be no talk,
no realistic sound.</i>

02:39.960 --> 02:41.313
<i>I think it would spoil the mood.</i>

02:41.520 --> 02:43.875
<i>I have composed 2 hours of music
which I hope</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:48.358
<i>will be more agreeable than the sound
of footsteps on the gravel path.</i>

02:48.560 --> 02:51.199
<i>Or a lot of yackety-yak talking
as I'm doing now.</i>

02:51.680 --> 02:54.672
<i>There'll be music and action,
a sort of a comic ballet.</i>

02:55.040 --> 02:58.350
<i>And now I shall retire behind
my curtain of silence.</i>

03:00.400 --> 03:04.791
A DOG'S LIFE

03:09.720 --> 03:11.119
Dawn.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.751
Scraps --
a thoroughbred mongrel.

06:11.960 --> 06:16.112
<i>Wanted! Strong men for
Sewer Work. Bring Recommendation</i>

06:29.440 --> 06:32.193
<i>Men wanted for Brewery</i>

11:31.920 --> 11:33.353
A tender spot in
the tenderloin.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.320
<i>THE GREEN LANTERN</i>

15:06.200 --> 15:08.634
<i>NO DOGS ALLOWED</i>

16:56.840 --> 16:58.990
A new singer sings
an old song.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.479
"If you smile and
wink, they'll buy
a drink."

19:34.640 --> 19:36.039
"I'm flirting."

21:26.840 --> 21:28.637
"How about the lady?"

23:49.480 --> 23:51.755
"There are strangers
in our midst."

25:13.480 --> 25:15.516
Back to the Green Lantern.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.475
"We will settle down
in the country."

33:31.440 --> 33:33.192
When dreams
come true.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.630
<i>The next picture is a comedy
of the First World War.</i>

35:35.280 --> 35:37.589
<i>These are actual scenes
of the fighting,</i>

35:37.800 --> 35:39.756
<i>taken from the archives
of the Imperial War Museum.</i>

35:40.720 --> 35:42.472
<i>Fighting was different in those days.</i>

35:42.680 --> 35:43.749
<i>They lived in trenches for months,</i>

35:43.960 --> 35:45.473
<i>languishing in dugouts and mud</i>

35:45.680 --> 35:47.238
<i>until the fatal Zero Hour</i>

35:47.520 --> 35:50.557
<i>when they went over the top
and captured the enemy's trench.</i>

35:51.280 --> 35:52.269
<i>Half of them made it,</i>

35:52.480 --> 35:53.356
<i>half of them didn't.</i>

35:53.920 --> 35:55.956
<i>There were no atomic bombs
or guided missiles.</i>

35:56.160 --> 35:58.549
<i>Then, it was only cannons,
bayonets and poison gas.</i>

36:00.120 --> 36:02.190
<i>Those were the good old days.</i>

36:02.400 --> 36:04.072
<i>So now, Shoulder Arms.</i>

36:07.240 --> 36:10.835
SHOULDER ARMS

36:25.040 --> 36:26.792
The awkward squad.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.552
"Put those feet in."

38:45.120 --> 38:46.917
Over there.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.232
The enemy.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.072
A quiet lunch.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.837
"Make yourself
at home."

42:10.640 --> 42:11.755
Later.

42:30.360 --> 42:31.395
Changing quard.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.789
"The password --
<i>'It's wet'.</i>"

43:05.360 --> 43:06.713
News from home.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.515
"This must be yours."

45:47.360 --> 45:48.793
"To the day!"

46:10.960 --> 46:11.915
Bed time.

47:09.120 --> 47:10.678
"Stop rocking
the boat!"

48:02.840 --> 48:03.909
Morning.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.990
"Over the top in
fifteen minutes!"

50:34.480 --> 50:36.277
The captured trench.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.750
13 not so unlucky.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.711
"How did you capture
thirteen?"

51:40.840 --> 51:42.637
"I surrounded them."

52:05.880 --> 52:07.836
Two of a kind.
