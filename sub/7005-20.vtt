00:02.135 --> 00:05.103
That finishes up
the installation
of the sliding glass door.

00:05.104 --> 00:08.840
And you want to be sure that
the door stile is parallel to
the joint.

00:08.841 --> 00:11.410
This door is perfect.

00:11.411 --> 00:12.811
Good job, al.
Thank you, tim.

00:12.812 --> 00:14.846
We also added a feature
I think you're gonna enjoy.

00:14.847 --> 00:18.283
At home your door always stays
open, allowing pesky insects

00:18.284 --> 00:21.286
Or that annoying insurance
salesman in.

00:21.287 --> 00:24.823
That's why we've installed
the binford 6100 slide master.

00:24.824 --> 00:30.294
It automatically closes the door
once you've walked through it.

00:30.295 --> 00:32.229
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

00:32.231 --> 00:33.664
Good.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.769
As nice as
that feature is,

00:37.770 --> 00:40.304
There's always that energetic
mosquito that slides in.

00:40.305 --> 00:43.742
Or a claims adjuster. Boom!
They're in and you don't
even know about it. Right?

00:43.743 --> 00:49.580
So I modified this bad boy to
close ten times faster than
a normal one.

00:49.581 --> 00:51.850
You did?
Yes!

00:51.851 --> 00:55.553
I used a small magnetic diffuser
from binford, right?

00:55.554 --> 00:58.023
You just turn it up to
the speed you want.

00:58.024 --> 00:59.824
<i>(whirring)</i>

00:59.825 --> 01:03.094
Ahh! All right.
Try it. Show them.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.335
Heidi, please demonstrate
the door.

01:10.336 --> 01:13.071
Yeah, right.

01:13.072 --> 01:15.540
All right. I'll do it.

01:20.112 --> 01:22.781
Presto. You walk through
and the door shuts.

01:22.782 --> 01:24.983
<i>(crash)</i>

01:24.984 --> 01:27.486
<i>(man yells)</i>

01:27.487 --> 01:29.521
When you install these
at home,

01:29.522 --> 01:34.025
You might want to use
shatterproof glass.

01:34.026 --> 01:38.563
And a small part of
your brain.

01:38.564 --> 01:40.832
That's it for the show.
Join us tomorrow

01:40.833 --> 01:42.967
When we show our segment,
"the resourceful tool man."

01:42.968 --> 01:45.803
And our discussion panel,
"sump pumps: How they work..."

01:45.804 --> 01:50.242
And are they the right thing
to wear with an evening gown?

01:50.243 --> 01:52.544
<i>(â™ª "tool time" theme)</i>

01:57.416 --> 01:59.984
Hey! Hey!

01:59.985 --> 02:01.919
Great show, tim.
Thank you, boss.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.689
Tell that to the guy you just
sent to the emergency room.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.224
Oh, boy.
Hey, dave!

02:06.225 --> 02:09.693
Use my name down there you'll
get the tim taylor suite.

02:09.695 --> 02:10.761
Put pressure on that.

02:10.762 --> 02:14.499
Use some salve
and ointments on that.

02:14.500 --> 02:19.304
You know, tim, it occurred to
me that you and I have never
gone out socially.

02:19.305 --> 02:23.407
If you're asking me out on
a date, I'll need more time.

02:23.408 --> 02:25.744
I gotta get my hair done
or something.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.146
Would you and jill like to
go bowling with me and my wife
tonight?

02:28.147 --> 02:30.749
And afterwards we can
grab some dinner.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.384
It sounds like it's
right up my alley.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.752
Yeah, all right.
Ok. Good deal.

02:34.753 --> 02:36.688
You know, ilene
and I love to bowl.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.024
And, you know,
we're free tonight.

02:39.025 --> 02:41.092
You're still free tonight.

03:33.946 --> 03:35.146
Hey, randy.

03:35.147 --> 03:36.548
Hey.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.950
You don't have
a date tonight, right?

03:38.951 --> 03:41.118
Why do you always assume
I have no life?

03:43.188 --> 03:44.356
Well, do you have plans?

03:44.357 --> 03:46.658
Totally free. What's up?

03:46.659 --> 03:49.194
Angela wants you to go out
with her younger sister.

03:49.195 --> 03:52.430
You'd really like jessica.
She thinks you're cute,
and she's cute.

03:52.431 --> 03:54.832
She takes after my dad's side
of the family, which is a drag

03:54.833 --> 03:58.803
Because they're all alcoholics
and drink themselves into
an early grave.

03:58.804 --> 04:00.105
Is she anything like you?

04:00.106 --> 04:02.039
Yeah. People say we're
really alike.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.276
Randy, it's your lucky day.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.177
She'll be so disappointed if
you don't go out with her,

04:06.178 --> 04:09.414
So just think about it 'cause
it would mean a lot to her...

04:09.415 --> 04:11.182
Ok, ok! I'll, like,
totally think about it.

04:11.183 --> 04:13.884
Great.

04:13.885 --> 04:15.420
Don't worry.
He'll come around.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.488
Hi.
Hi.

04:17.490 --> 04:21.726
Bye.
Bye.

04:21.726 --> 04:24.628
What was all that about?
Nothing.

04:24.629 --> 04:27.732
Brad and angela are trying
to get me to go out with
her little sister.

04:27.733 --> 04:31.836
I'm kind of worried she's gonna
be as annoying as angela.

04:31.837 --> 04:34.873
Now, randy, don't be
so judgmental.

04:34.874 --> 04:38.676
Hey! I am not the one who said
angela's a giant fingernail

04:38.677 --> 04:41.746
And the world is
her blackboard.

04:47.252 --> 04:51.289
That was a private conversation
I was having with your father.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.495
Hey.
Oh!

04:57.496 --> 04:59.163
Hi.
Hi.

04:59.164 --> 05:01.165
Put away the fish,
get out your bowling shoes.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.635
We're going bowling, having
dinner with bud and his wife
tonight.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.402
Tonight? I can't go tonight.

05:05.403 --> 05:08.006
I have that lecture for
my abnormal psych class.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.441
You don't have to go to that.
You know what they're gonna say.

05:10.442 --> 05:13.812
"there's a lot of crazy people
out there and there's nothing
we can do about it."

05:13.813 --> 05:16.648
You're living proof of that.

05:16.649 --> 05:20.184
This means an awful lot to me.
No, honey. I can't just
drop everything

05:20.185 --> 05:22.387
Because bud wants to
go bowling.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.123
This is not about bowling.
This is about my future
with binford.

05:25.124 --> 05:28.092
I got big plans. This could be
the start of the tim taylor
empire.

05:28.093 --> 05:32.330
The tim taylor empire?
<i>(laughs)</i>

05:32.331 --> 05:34.632
Come on. Why does it just have
to be <i>tool time?</i>

05:34.633 --> 05:36.467
How about <i>car time?</i>

05:36.468 --> 05:41.372
And we could add the spin-off,
<i>tool time: The next generation.</i>

05:41.373 --> 05:44.275
And how about
an interactive tim?

05:44.276 --> 05:46.978
I've been looking for one of
those for years.

05:46.979 --> 05:50.181
Come on. When an important guy
like bud asks you to socialize,

05:50.182 --> 05:52.683
You do it because
it's good for your career.

05:52.684 --> 05:53.952
Well, what about my lecture?

05:53.953 --> 05:56.821
Can't you find somebody to
videotape it?

05:56.822 --> 06:00.358
I mean, how many times have
I asked you to do something
like this?

06:00.359 --> 06:03.728
If I do this for you,
what do I get out of it?

06:03.729 --> 06:05.663
The satisfaction of knowing
you're on the ground floor

06:05.664 --> 06:08.132
Of the beginning of
the tim taylor empire.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.036
How about a watch?

06:17.309 --> 06:19.777
All right!

06:19.778 --> 06:25.683
Do you ever wonder how many
feet have been in a pair of
rented bowling shoes?

06:25.684 --> 06:28.085
No. But my guess would be
an even number.

06:33.025 --> 06:35.292
Tonight, if you
don't mind,

06:35.293 --> 06:36.861
Let's not talk about
your psychology class.

06:36.862 --> 06:41.432
I want to make sure
bud's having a good time.

06:41.433 --> 06:44.569
You're gonna tell me what I can
and cannot say to the man?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.537
Just a suggestion,
you know?

06:46.538 --> 06:47.738
I want to make sure
that he's in a good mood

06:47.739 --> 06:50.308
To listen to my ideas.
I don't know.

06:50.309 --> 06:53.744
If you're gonna treat me
this way, maybe I shouldn't
have come.

06:53.745 --> 06:56.547
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
I'm just a little nervous.

06:56.548 --> 06:59.083
I want everything to go well.
I need you, I want you here.

06:59.084 --> 07:03.254
I mean, the empire wouldn't be
an empire without an empress.

07:03.255 --> 07:05.523
With you by my side...
Hey, tim!

07:05.524 --> 07:09.260
Hey, you know the rest.

07:09.261 --> 07:10.828
Hey, bud.
Hey, tim!

07:10.829 --> 07:12.230
Tim, how are you doing?

07:12.231 --> 07:13.831
Tim, jill, this is
my wife jean.

07:13.832 --> 07:16.334
Hi. It's nice to meet you.
You too.

07:16.335 --> 07:19.770
Finally, jean.
I feel like I know you
from watching <i>tool time.</i>

07:19.771 --> 07:21.573
Jean's a big fan of
the show.

07:21.574 --> 07:22.940
Really?
Oh, yeah.

07:22.941 --> 07:27.178
I just love the clever way you
pretend to be so inept.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.084
It's a gift.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.955
So, how are the psychology
classes going, jill?

07:36.956 --> 07:41.192
Well, I'd tell you, but I don't
want to ruin your evening.

07:41.193 --> 07:42.794
I understand.
School is tough.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.863
When I went back to
get my degree,

07:44.864 --> 07:47.431
I had to go at night
because I was working full-time.

07:47.432 --> 07:50.401
Really?
I never thought I'd make it,
but here I am.

07:50.402 --> 07:53.104
Yeah. Bowling with
the tool man.

07:53.105 --> 07:56.740
That's the dream
that kept me going.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.951
Yes! Yes!

08:09.821 --> 08:13.391
Three strikes in a row!
I can't believe it!

08:13.392 --> 08:15.994
How far are we ahead now?
You're up by ten.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.562
Do you have to ask
after every frame?

08:18.563 --> 08:20.899
Yes, I do.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.534
Bud, will you relax?
I am relaxed.

08:23.535 --> 08:25.336
I'm hungry.
Can we order some food?

08:25.337 --> 08:28.339
Yeah.
Oh, no, no. I don't allow
food on the lanes.

08:28.340 --> 08:31.442
Somebody always spills
something.

08:31.443 --> 08:33.410
You don't allow it?

08:33.412 --> 08:35.446
We understand.
Of course we understand.

08:35.447 --> 08:37.749
You're watching your weight
anyway, honey. It's ok.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.784
Excuse me?

08:39.784 --> 08:42.453
Did you say something
about my weight?

08:42.453 --> 08:47.792
I said, "let's wait.
And we'll eat later."

08:47.793 --> 08:51.428
I'm gonna go get myself
a big old tub of popcorn

08:51.429 --> 08:53.932
With lots of extra butter.

08:53.933 --> 08:54.899
Well, since we're
taking a break,

08:54.900 --> 08:56.600
I'm getting myself
a new rosin bag.

08:56.601 --> 09:01.673
And when I come back, you're not
gonna know what hit you.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.441
What's the matter with him?

09:03.442 --> 09:07.612
You'll have to excuse bud.
He's... He's very competitive.

09:07.613 --> 09:10.214
Well, that's how guys
like us are.

09:10.215 --> 09:13.751
Yeah, but when bud loses,
he holds a grudge.
What do you mean?

09:13.752 --> 09:18.889
Well, last year the vice
president of his textile
company out-bowled him.

09:18.890 --> 09:21.626
Bud transferred him
to the manufacturing division.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.262
So?
In pakistan.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.664
Huh?

09:26.665 --> 09:29.801
Excuse me. I'm gonna go bowl
real quick before bud gets back.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.869
That way I can avoid the -

09:31.870 --> 09:35.873
"honey, let me show you
what you did wrong" speech.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.547
Can I talk to you
about your bowling?

09:43.548 --> 09:46.884
I am bowling the best game of
my life. Isn't it great?

09:46.885 --> 09:48.418
It is.
Can you stop?

09:49.320 --> 09:51.055
What?

09:51.056 --> 09:54.792
Well, apparently, bud is a bad
loser. He holds a grudge.

09:54.793 --> 09:56.760
So, you want me to throw

09:56.761 --> 10:00.631
The best game of my life
because bud is a sore loser?

10:00.632 --> 10:04.935
You used to do it with the boys
when they played go fish.
When they were five!

10:07.673 --> 10:09.674
Go, honey.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.715
Hey, look at that!
Yeah! All right!

10:17.716 --> 10:19.249
Strike!

10:19.250 --> 10:22.820
Wait a minute. Aren't you
rooting for the wrong team?

10:23.822 --> 10:27.024
You're not jill.

10:27.025 --> 10:28.893
That's jill.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.895
Must be the lighting.

10:30.896 --> 10:33.230
Remember that tip I gave you
about bowling correctly?

10:33.231 --> 10:36.166
I'm not interested
in your tips.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.535
Ripped your pants.
Oh!

11:07.866 --> 11:10.400
So, jessica,
did you like the pizza?

11:10.401 --> 11:13.237
Well, I...
She totally loves pizza.

11:13.238 --> 11:15.873
Remember that time we were
in that chinese restaurant?

11:15.874 --> 11:18.208
Oh, yeah...
She asked mr. Woo,
"do you have pizza?"

11:18.209 --> 11:20.912
He stared like she was crazy.
It was so embarrassing.

11:20.913 --> 11:24.315
She should have just had
a hamburger like I did.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.984
Wait. You got a hamburger
at a chinese restaurant?

11:26.985 --> 11:30.154
I've never heard of that.
I always get the burrito.

11:32.424 --> 11:33.557
<i>(car horn honks)</i>

11:33.558 --> 11:35.159
Oh, that must be mom.

11:36.328 --> 11:39.997
I hope you had
a nice time, jessica.

11:39.998 --> 11:41.599
Thanks, randy. I...

11:41.600 --> 11:44.368
Jessica, stop yakking.
Mom's waiting.

11:44.369 --> 11:46.937
Bye.

11:49.874 --> 11:52.710
See you, guys.
Hope you had fun.
<i>(randy)</i> bye.

11:56.047 --> 11:59.049
Well, what did you
think of jessica?

11:59.050 --> 12:03.487
Well, I'll let you know when
angela actually lets her talk.

12:03.488 --> 12:06.124
Yeah, but you gotta admit
she's pretty fine.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.693
You know, when I go out
with a girl, I like to know

12:08.694 --> 12:11.362
She can actually finish
a sentence.

12:11.363 --> 12:14.065
Like my woman.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.702
Yeah, just like that.

12:21.206 --> 12:22.639
Would you let it go already?

12:22.640 --> 12:25.509
Nobody is gonna ship
you off to pakistan!

12:25.510 --> 12:28.079
Except maybe me.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.980
All I know is every pin
you knocked down

12:29.981 --> 12:32.383
Killed another one of
my dreams.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.218
You are being ridiculous.

12:34.219 --> 12:36.554
Bud is not gonna hold
this against you.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.455
Didn't you notice after
the fifth frame,

12:38.456 --> 12:40.691
The man hardly said a word?

12:40.692 --> 12:42.726
So he was a little quiet.

12:42.727 --> 12:47.999
Well, a quiet bud is a mad bud.
And a mad bud is a bad bud.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.633
The mood he was in, it was
impossible for me to

12:49.634 --> 12:51.769
Talk about my plans
for binford.

12:51.770 --> 12:55.305
You think I jeopardized your
entire future by bowling well?

12:55.306 --> 12:57.675
If the rented shoe fits...
Ahh!

12:57.676 --> 13:00.378
If I'd known you'd act like
this, I wouldn't have let
you come.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.680
Let me come?
You begged me to come!

13:02.681 --> 13:04.515
Because I thought
you'd be helpful.

13:04.516 --> 13:06.250
You are absolutely
unbelievable.

13:06.251 --> 13:08.385
First you make me
miss my lecture.

13:08.386 --> 13:10.420
Then you tell me what I can
or can't say to bud.

13:10.421 --> 13:12.289
I'm not allowed to eat.

13:12.290 --> 13:15.359
And then I have to throw
the best game of my life.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.028
I just wanted you to
be more flexible.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.963
Flexible?

13:18.964 --> 13:22.666
Whatever direction you
pointed me in, I was expected
to perform.

13:22.667 --> 13:27.772
I was like your
little binford windup wife.

13:27.773 --> 13:31.976
Binford doesn't make
a windup wife!

13:31.977 --> 13:34.745
I've been your windup husband
whenever you wanted me to.

13:34.746 --> 13:36.414
Went to the professor's house
for dinner, remember that?

13:36.415 --> 13:39.317
Yeah! You complained
the whole night.
I did whatever you wanted!

13:39.318 --> 13:41.719
I only asked you to
pass the onion dip!

13:41.720 --> 13:43.154
Well, you got it,
didn't you?

13:43.155 --> 13:47.057
You say that you need me
by your side.

13:47.058 --> 13:49.927
And then you don't even
treat me like a person.

13:49.928 --> 13:53.130
You acted like I was just
one of your appendages.

13:53.131 --> 13:56.534
Well, forgive me for thinking
my career's important.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.170
Apparently, that's all
you think is important.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.804
Oh, that's not true.

14:00.805 --> 14:04.408
Where you hit me with
the bowling ball I find
quite important too.

14:04.409 --> 14:09.212
Well, that's ok. 'cause I think
it's gonna have plenty of time
to heal!

14:13.652 --> 14:15.753
<i>(crickets chirping)</i>

14:18.690 --> 14:21.025
Hey, wilson.
Am I losing my mind?

14:21.026 --> 14:23.094
Or do I hear crickets in
the middle of winter?

14:23.095 --> 14:24.828
Well, you certainly do,
neighbor.

14:24.829 --> 14:27.464
I brought my pet crickets
out to serenade me.

14:30.335 --> 14:33.804
Wilson, have you ever had
a normal pet?

14:33.805 --> 14:37.041
Well, I had a marmoset once.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.911
But my ocelot ate it.

14:39.912 --> 14:43.147
You're one odd duck, wilson.

14:43.148 --> 14:45.983
I had one of those.
Ocelot got it, too.

14:45.984 --> 14:48.819
I'm kind of sorry
I brought it up.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.187
Oh, tim!

14:50.188 --> 14:53.057
Jill told me about
bowling with bud.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.392
What did she say?

14:54.393 --> 14:57.194
Well, she said it was
quite a brouhaha.

14:57.195 --> 14:59.330
Well, there were no brews
and very few ha-ha's,

14:59.331 --> 15:01.399
I'll tell you that.

15:01.400 --> 15:06.871
Did she also mention
that she thought I was
treating her like my appendix?

15:06.872 --> 15:08.773
Well, yes, she did.

15:08.774 --> 15:11.175
I believe the word
she used was "appendage."

15:11.176 --> 15:12.776
When she's in a bad mood,

15:12.777 --> 15:15.980
It's no time to correct her
english, I'll tell you that.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.916
And what's wrong with me
caring about my career?

15:18.917 --> 15:22.986
Tim, maybe jill just feels
that you put your ambition
ahead of her feelings.

15:22.987 --> 15:26.357
I'm reminded of the critic
john ruskin, who said:

15:26.358 --> 15:27.792
"when a man is wrapped up
in himself,

15:27.793 --> 15:30.328
He makes a very small package."

15:30.329 --> 15:35.632
Yeah, but my grandma always
told me good things come
in small packages.

15:38.002 --> 15:40.571
How true, how true.

15:40.572 --> 15:43.341
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm.

15:43.342 --> 15:47.178
Of course, you're the one
whose wife isn't talking to him.

15:47.179 --> 15:50.214
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm.

15:53.118 --> 15:57.488
And a little bit of toothpaste
will take that rust right off
your counter top.

15:57.489 --> 16:00.991
And don't forget to floss.

16:00.992 --> 16:03.560
Now, let's say you got paint
all over your hands

16:03.561 --> 16:05.062
And you're out of solvent.

16:05.063 --> 16:09.033
What does a resourceful
tool man do now?
Get some french fries.

16:09.034 --> 16:12.736
Which is usually al's answer
for just about everything.

16:12.737 --> 16:15.439
But, in this case,
my bloated buddy is correct.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.178
The grease in the fries
acts as a solvent -

16:21.179 --> 16:22.913
It'll take paint
right off your hands.

16:22.914 --> 16:25.783
That's right. And since
your fingers are already in
the fries,

16:25.784 --> 16:29.085
You can snack on the ones
that aren't covered in
semi-gloss.

16:40.932 --> 16:44.101
Al, what's the next tip
from the resourceful tool man?

16:44.102 --> 16:47.137
All right. Well, say you want
to polish up some brass

16:47.138 --> 16:48.538
And you're out of cleaner.

16:48.539 --> 16:50.407
The resourceful tool man will
use...

16:50.408 --> 16:52.609
<i>(both)</i> ketchup.

16:52.610 --> 16:55.479
In the tomatoes is vitamin c.
It'll take tarnish off brass.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.748
Actually,
it's the vinegar.

16:57.749 --> 17:01.252
I believe it's
the vitamin c.
I believe it's the vinegar.

17:01.253 --> 17:04.788
I believe it's my show.

17:04.789 --> 17:07.656
Could be the vitamin c.

17:07.657 --> 17:09.960
Thank you, al.
We'll have more tips

17:09.961 --> 17:12.128
Right after these few messages
from binford tools.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.932
<i>(â™ª "tool time" theme)</i>

17:14.933 --> 17:17.000
I told you it was vitamin c!
Tim!

17:17.001 --> 17:20.438
Would you stop for a minute...
Bud, what's the matter?

17:20.439 --> 17:23.473
Tim, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.476
Oh. I knew this was coming.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.278
I want a chance to
beat you and jill.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.380
I want a rematch.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.315
A rematch? I don't think
that's gonna happen.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.584
Why not?
Jill didn't have fun,

17:33.585 --> 17:35.186
And I won't ask her to
do it again.

17:35.187 --> 17:38.955
Even if it means me going to
pakistan and doing turban time.

17:40.892 --> 17:43.894
Pakistan?
Yeah.

17:43.895 --> 17:46.630
Jean told me all about
that last vice president.

17:46.631 --> 17:49.266
Beat you in bowling,
you shipped him off to pakistan.

17:49.267 --> 17:52.336
Ah. Oh.

17:52.337 --> 17:56.841
Did she also tell you it was
her idiot brother who embezzled
money from the company?

17:56.842 --> 18:00.911
I think she might have
left out that little detail.

18:00.912 --> 18:02.746
I built that plant
in pakistan

18:02.747 --> 18:05.649
So we'd have a place
to send him.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.752
You wouldn't hold a grudge
against someone who beat you.

18:08.753 --> 18:12.756
Of course not. I'm a better
businessman than that.

18:12.757 --> 18:14.491
In that case, I got some ideas
I want to run by you

18:14.492 --> 18:17.093
About binford and my future.
Well, I want to hear them.

18:17.094 --> 18:20.131
Call my secretary and make
an appointment, ok?

18:20.132 --> 18:22.399
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.568
I sent her to pakistan, too.

18:32.644 --> 18:35.279
No.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.148
Don't you wanna at least hear
what I have to say?
No.

18:38.149 --> 18:41.452
The only reason I came...
No!

18:41.453 --> 18:43.721
I'll take that as a "no."

18:43.722 --> 18:46.590
Hey, mark.
Just 'cause I love you.

18:46.591 --> 18:48.125
No.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.498
I'm sorry about what happened in
the bowling alley.

18:54.499 --> 18:57.034
I acted like an idiot.

18:57.035 --> 19:00.237
Tim, it's not just
about last night.

19:00.238 --> 19:03.540
This kind of stuff has been
happening ever since you
went to work for bud.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.776
It has?
Yeah.

19:05.777 --> 19:08.745
Remember the weekend that we
were gonna have together,

19:08.746 --> 19:11.315
Just the two of us?

19:11.316 --> 19:13.851
It ended up being
the three of us, didn't it?
Exactly.

19:13.852 --> 19:17.120
I'm afraid that whenever
bud says, "jump,"

19:17.121 --> 19:18.222
You're gonna say,
"how high?"

19:18.223 --> 19:20.558
And I'm gonna be
the one you land on.

19:20.559 --> 19:24.161
I'll try not
to land on you.

19:24.162 --> 19:27.197
Tim, I don't want you to
forget about your ambition.

19:27.198 --> 19:28.999
I really don't.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.468
I just don't want you
to forget about me.

19:31.469 --> 19:34.338
I don't want to do that.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.273
Well, if my ambition gets
in the way, just,

19:36.274 --> 19:39.109
Um... Like, make sure
that I know about it.

19:40.144 --> 19:41.545
Ok.

19:46.885 --> 19:51.521
I'm ready for
those flowers now.
No.

19:51.522 --> 19:55.125
Hey, tell you what. Let's do
something fun tonight. Um...

19:55.126 --> 19:58.028
You pick.
Anything you want to do.

19:58.029 --> 20:01.298
Well, we could go upstairs,

20:01.299 --> 20:03.634
Get the lights down low...

20:03.635 --> 20:06.770
<i>(grunting)</i> oh, yeah.

20:06.771 --> 20:10.608
Get in bed.
Oh, yeah.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.510
And spend the next
three hours...
Eh!

20:13.511 --> 20:17.114
Considering where I got hit
with that bowling ball,
that's optimistic.

20:17.115 --> 20:20.684
Actually, I was thinking
about listening to the tape of
that lecture I missed.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.790
That might hurt more
than that bowling ball.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.263
Oh, look at this.

20:33.264 --> 20:37.634
We got our nachos,
pizza and chili fries.

20:37.635 --> 20:41.171
Yeah! Let's put on
some weight.

20:41.172 --> 20:42.939
This is the way
bowling should be.

20:42.940 --> 20:46.710
A nice, relaxed game,
no husbands, lots of food.

20:51.115 --> 20:54.585
Oh, boy! This is what
bowling's all about.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.953
No food, no wives

20:56.954 --> 20:59.990
And no going home
until I beat you.

21:04.929 --> 21:06.363
<i>(clears throat)</i>

21:19.811 --> 21:23.146
Did my wife tell you what
happened to the vice president
who threw the game?

21:26.651 --> 21:27.984
Wearing a turban?

21:27.985 --> 21:30.119
Fez.

21:33.424 --> 21:36.159
I'm reminded of the critic
john ruskin, who said:

21:36.160 --> 21:37.961
"when a man is wrapped up
in himself,

21:37.962 --> 21:40.764
He makes a very small package."

21:40.765 --> 21:43.600
Hm. My uncle bobo
once told me...

21:52.743 --> 21:55.579
Did my wife tell you what
happened to the vice president
who threw the game?

21:59.016 --> 22:00.617
Wearing a turban?

22:00.618 --> 22:02.352
Fez.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.523
Morocco!
