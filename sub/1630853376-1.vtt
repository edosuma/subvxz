WEBVTT

04:02.625 --> 04:05.296
Okay, Cherry,
all cards are on the table.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.198
We got a serious problem here.

04:07.231 --> 04:10.834
Turning tricks is one thing,
but robbery that's a felony.

04:10.868 --> 04:13.837
And robbery with a weapon,
that's robbery first degree.

04:13.871 --> 04:16.040
You're looking at
five years minimum.

04:17.074 --> 04:18.943
Come on, Captain.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.178
You detectives
have been trying to pin

04:21.212 --> 04:25.416
that robbery shit
on one of us girls for months.

04:25.449 --> 04:27.985
It's bullshit and you know it.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.300
Hands in the cage, animal.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.813
Fuck! You don't
wanna fucking do this!

04:59.816 --> 05:01.328
You're not gonna
fucking get away with this.

05:01.352 --> 05:02.752
What the fuck did you just...

05:02.785 --> 05:04.221
Shut the fuck up!

05:04.255 --> 05:06.223
Night-night, bitch.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.161
Snake...

05:16.799 --> 05:18.869
Wait for my signal, okay.

05:20.371 --> 05:21.539
Stay in the cell.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.008
- Wait till I get dressed.
- Right. Okay.

05:24.041 --> 05:27.011
I know we got your DNA
all over that room.

05:28.479 --> 05:32.983
I fucked that dude, I admit it.
I fucked that dude hard.

05:33.017 --> 05:36.320
I'd be shocked if my DNA
wasn't in the room.

05:36.353 --> 05:41.892
But DNA is not robbery,
you stupid damn motherfucker! Asshole.

05:45.728 --> 05:47.198
Be ready.

06:05.349 --> 06:07.618
Come on, Cherry, help me out.

06:07.651 --> 06:10.120
You help me and I'll help you.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.427
No!

06:17.827 --> 06:19.230
You know what?

06:19.263 --> 06:20.431
I didn't Rob anybody,

06:20.464 --> 06:24.134
and I'm tired
of the goddamn scam.

06:24.168 --> 06:26.870
You're charging me with felony,
I want a lawyer.

06:26.904 --> 06:28.838
You want a lawyer?
I'll get you a lawyer.

06:28.872 --> 06:32.977
But in the meantime, you're gonna
hang out with the boys down in holding.

06:34.578 --> 06:35.980
Fuck you.

06:37.681 --> 06:39.550
Can I help you officer?

06:39.583 --> 06:41.051
- Whoa.
- Surprise.

06:41.085 --> 06:44.555
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Surprise, surprise.

06:44.588 --> 06:48.259
- Don't fucking move.
- All right, just-just relax.

06:48.292 --> 06:49.893
Now you in my jail now.

06:49.927 --> 06:51.761
Okay, just tell me
what you need.

06:51.794 --> 06:53.473
Just settle down and relax.
Tell me what you need.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.766
- Who the fuck are you?
- Shut the fuck up, you're next.

06:58.535 --> 07:00.070
And you do
exactly as I tell you.

07:00.104 --> 07:02.805
Okay, all right,
just-just relax.

07:02.839 --> 07:07.211
Take the handcuffs out
and cuff yourself.

07:07.777 --> 07:09.980
Okay. Okay.

07:10.014 --> 07:12.316
Take 'em out and put them on.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.051
All right, all right.

07:14.084 --> 07:16.954
- All right, all right.
- From behind, asshole.

07:18.989 --> 07:21.791
Look, all right,
all right, all right.

07:21.824 --> 07:24.094
I ain't playin' with you, man.

07:24.128 --> 07:26.964
Okay, all right, I'm cuffed.

07:29.533 --> 07:30.934
All right, I'm cuffed.

07:30.968 --> 07:33.537
Nice try, motherfucker.

07:35.439 --> 07:36.774
Now get the fuck up.

07:36.806 --> 07:39.510
Okay, all right, all right,
just-just settle down.

07:41.078 --> 07:42.880
Don't you fucking move.

07:42.913 --> 07:45.482
- Shut it.
- All right.

07:48.452 --> 07:50.220
- Is it true?
- No.

07:53.691 --> 07:55.492
Everybody down!

07:59.997 --> 08:02.066
Go, Raj, get 'em!
Grab the weapons.

08:02.099 --> 08:03.367
Sit down, come here.

08:07.037 --> 08:09.106
Don't do something stupid, pops!

08:09.139 --> 08:11.175
Your fucking move now.

08:12.376 --> 08:13.677
Don't look at me!

08:13.711 --> 08:15.179
Get 'em cuffed, get 'em cuffed.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.716
Let's go, let's go!
We ain't got much time!

08:18.749 --> 08:21.318
- Hurry up.
- No heroes today, pops.

08:21.352 --> 08:22.886
Handcuff that asshole.

08:25.689 --> 08:27.358
You guys like this, huh?

08:27.391 --> 08:28.601
You like seeing
your captain like this?

08:28.625 --> 08:30.294
Move.

08:30.327 --> 08:32.763
Don't give me a fucking reason,
sit down.

08:32.796 --> 08:34.498
Put a fucking cuff on.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.501
Put it on!

08:57.087 --> 08:58.655
Do her, man.

09:11.535 --> 09:13.170
Now what, man?

09:15.239 --> 09:16.306
Now...

09:20.511 --> 09:22.379
Now we wait.

09:30.521 --> 09:31.789
Shit...

09:31.822 --> 09:34.091
Shit... Shit!

09:34.859 --> 09:37.194
Fuck.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.435
Patch me through.

09:44.468 --> 09:46.069
Right away.

10:13.096 --> 10:17.067
- What?
- This is FBI Special Agent Roger Kinkaid.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.402
Who am I speaking to?

10:18.435 --> 10:20.137
This is McMasters,

10:20.170 --> 10:23.875
and I have the captain
and a few other pigs in here.

10:23.908 --> 10:26.878
Okay, Mr. McMasters.

10:26.911 --> 10:28.479
What do you want from us?

10:29.446 --> 10:30.814
I don't know.

10:30.848 --> 10:32.983
Let me get back
to you about that.

10:37.321 --> 10:38.489
Shit.

10:39.423 --> 10:41.325
What do we do now?

10:41.358 --> 10:44.194
There's nothing we can do
until he calls back.

11:04.314 --> 11:06.951
Okay, what do
we know about these three men?

11:06.985 --> 11:11.288
Okay, Frank Williamson
a.k.a. Snake,

11:11.321 --> 11:16.426
he is a convicted rapist,
gun and drug smuggler.

11:16.460 --> 11:18.395
He's been arrested
multiple times

11:18.428 --> 11:21.498
and his attorney always
finds a way to get him off.

11:22.633 --> 11:24.668
Rajesh Carnak,

11:24.701 --> 11:28.672
a.k.a. the Midnight Strangler,
the famous serial killer.

11:28.705 --> 11:31.208
- He's the one responsible...
- Okay, okay.

11:31.241 --> 11:33.677
I'm very familiar with
this case. Let's move on.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.346
Mike McMasters.

11:36.380 --> 11:39.516
Paranoid schizophrenic
and the leader of this group.

11:39.550 --> 11:44.087
He was arrested for homicide
and got off scot-free.

11:44.121 --> 11:47.324
Apparently there wasn't
enough evidence to convict him.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.160
The three have a long history.

11:50.193 --> 11:52.262
They've known each other
for years.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.498
They've been
incarcerated together

11:54.531 --> 11:57.234
and wanted to form
some sort of alliance

11:57.267 --> 11:59.803
to bring terror
to small communities,

11:59.836 --> 12:02.874
eventually working their way
up to larger cities.

12:02.907 --> 12:04.976
Thank God they
didn't get to do that.

12:05.009 --> 12:08.178
Yes, but look what happened now.

12:08.211 --> 12:13.717
A rapist, a serial killer and a paranoid
schizophrenic holding hostages.

12:15.218 --> 12:17.421
What a fucking mess.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.969
Hey.

12:31.002 --> 12:33.103
Look what I found.

12:35.706 --> 12:38.475
Hey, can we keep her?

12:40.377 --> 12:43.146
Better yet, can I have her?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.148
She's all yours.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.351
- You can't do that!
- Shut the fuck up!

12:47.384 --> 12:51.154
- Sit your ass down.
- Hey, I found her, she's mine.

12:51.188 --> 12:54.224
He said I could have her,
dammit, not you.

12:54.257 --> 12:56.995
Fuck, chicken head.
I fucking found her.

12:57.028 --> 12:58.997
- I'm taking her.
- That's enough!

12:59.030 --> 13:02.033
Officer, it's scary.

13:02.066 --> 13:03.734
He looks so evil.

13:03.767 --> 13:06.803
I know one minute you're mean,
the next minute

13:06.837 --> 13:09.172
you're a good, good cop.

13:09.206 --> 13:12.476
I'm in good hands, right?
You won't hurt me.

13:12.509 --> 13:13.978
Will you take her over there?

13:14.012 --> 13:16.023
We'll figure out what we're
gonna do with her later on.

13:16.047 --> 13:18.016
- Get over there.
- Don't hurt me.

13:20.517 --> 13:22.386
I know what I'm gonna
do with her later on.

13:22.419 --> 13:25.255
You ain't doing shit.

13:25.288 --> 13:27.591
Thank God she's mine, man.

13:27.624 --> 13:29.226
Are you okay?

13:29.259 --> 13:32.162
He's not a cop.

13:32.195 --> 13:33.931
Knock off the chit chat.

13:40.437 --> 13:41.638
Thanks.

14:08.066 --> 14:09.633
McMasters, right?

14:11.501 --> 14:14.538
Look, uh, you can still
get out of this.

14:14.571 --> 14:17.240
All you gotta do
is let us all go.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.609
I mean, I'll put in a good word
for you and the others.

14:19.643 --> 14:23.047
Look, I'll tell the FBI you
didn't hurt me or any of my guys.

14:23.081 --> 14:25.749
They'll just think...

14:25.782 --> 14:26.783
Hey!

14:31.055 --> 14:32.389
Oh, no, no.

14:34.192 --> 14:36.326
Don't worry, sweetheart.
He's only sleeping.

14:36.359 --> 14:38.295
- He needs a doctor.
- Get her ass down.

14:38.328 --> 14:39.663
You bastard!

14:43.233 --> 14:45.602
- What do we do now?
- We got in this together,

14:45.635 --> 14:48.405
we'll get out of it.
We got this.

14:48.438 --> 14:51.475
Maybe we could use these pigs
as bargaining chips, huh?

14:51.508 --> 14:52.843
What do you think they're worth?

14:54.544 --> 14:57.347
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars each?

14:57.380 --> 14:59.382
They ain't worth
a hundred grand.

14:59.416 --> 15:01.853
Get the fuck out of my face.

15:03.353 --> 15:04.755
Look, man,
it's a million dollars.

15:04.788 --> 15:07.491
That's what they're worth,
that's what we're gonna get.

15:07.524 --> 15:10.070
- We gotta lock this place down.
- Go get it done, it's your job.

15:10.094 --> 15:11.695
I got it.

15:11.728 --> 15:13.530
What are we gonna do
with that bitch?

15:13.563 --> 15:15.532
Officer...

15:16.633 --> 15:18.568
I'm sure you make
a lot of money.

15:18.602 --> 15:20.570
I have a daughter, she needs me.

15:20.604 --> 15:23.807
I'm not that bright
so I'm useless here, can I go?

15:24.741 --> 15:27.011
We're gonna have
a lot of fun with her.

15:29.046 --> 15:30.081
Later.

15:30.114 --> 15:31.748
Much later.

15:31.782 --> 15:33.316
No, I'm useless.

15:33.350 --> 15:37.989
You listen and sit
your fucking ass down.

15:38.022 --> 15:39.723
Now!

15:40.690 --> 15:41.825
I'm sorry.

15:49.133 --> 15:50.400
I'm sorry.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.783
I'm gonna call.

16:15.126 --> 16:16.426
Yes?

16:16.459 --> 16:20.397
McMasters, it's Roger Kinkaid.

16:21.331 --> 16:22.967
<i>Ready to talk now?</i>

16:23.733 --> 16:25.635
Sure.

16:25.669 --> 16:29.106
But first,
is there anybody hurt in there?

16:29.140 --> 16:31.242
Anybody need medical attention?

16:31.275 --> 16:32.509
<i>Everybody's fine.</i>

16:32.542 --> 16:36.746
- For now.
- <i>Okay.</i>

16:38.282 --> 16:41.285
So what exactly
do you want from us?

16:41.319 --> 16:47.457
Well, for starters
I want four million apiece.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.793
<i>A million for each pig here.</i>

16:51.195 --> 16:52.829
And for the captain,

16:52.864 --> 16:59.603
I want a chopper, a pilot
and a full tank of gas.

17:01.973 --> 17:05.642
And the bitch,
you can have her for free.

17:05.675 --> 17:06.944
Got this?

17:08.045 --> 17:09.613
<i>Consider it a gift</i>

17:10.147 --> 17:11.883
<i>from me to you</i>

17:11.916 --> 17:13.683
<i>since I'm so polite.</i>

17:14.751 --> 17:16.287
What girl?

17:16.320 --> 17:18.890
Well, well, well.

17:18.923 --> 17:23.393
For someone who works in
the intelligence field,

17:23.426 --> 17:25.096
you sure don't have much,
do you?

17:30.600 --> 17:33.137
She's nothing, she's a whore.

17:34.338 --> 17:35.572
We found her.

17:35.605 --> 17:37.909
<i>That's why you get it for free.</i>

17:37.942 --> 17:43.347
McMasters, you gotta realize that
we can't get $4 million that quickly.

17:43.381 --> 17:45.715
Listen to me, you fuck!

17:45.749 --> 17:47.550
I'm the one in charge here!

17:48.319 --> 17:50.388
<i>Do you get this?</i>

17:50.420 --> 17:53.257
And if I don't have
these demands,

17:53.291 --> 17:57.328
I will start killing these
people one by one every hour.

17:57.361 --> 17:58.561
You got that, amigo?

17:58.595 --> 18:01.631
<i>And as for the bitch,</i>

18:01.665 --> 18:04.368
we will fuck her,
we will gut her,

18:04.402 --> 18:07.071
and we will kill her,
and fuck her again!

18:08.105 --> 18:09.673
Not in that particular order.

18:09.706 --> 18:11.708
I think you get the point.

18:12.475 --> 18:14.011
You have one hour.

18:16.881 --> 18:18.481
Fuck.

18:19.216 --> 18:20.418
Fuck!

18:29.659 --> 18:31.295
Where did this girl come from?

18:31.329 --> 18:33.097
I don't know.

18:40.938 --> 18:43.341
The problem
with a paranoid schizophrenic

18:43.374 --> 18:45.910
is we never know
who we're actually talking to.

18:45.943 --> 18:48.312
What are you doing here,
Rodriguez?

18:48.346 --> 18:50.647
- Move.
- By whose authority?

18:50.680 --> 18:52.183
I'm in charge now.

19:01.624 --> 19:04.095
McMasters, this is Rodriguez.

19:04.128 --> 19:05.595
Who's this?

19:07.198 --> 19:09.599
Put Kinkaid on the line.

19:09.632 --> 19:13.337
McMasters, this is Rodriguez
and I'm in charge now.

19:13.371 --> 19:15.839
Listen, I'm in charge!

19:15.873 --> 19:19.276
Listen, McMasters,
I'm not here to play your games.

19:19.310 --> 19:22.146
Put Captain Davis
on the phone now.

19:22.179 --> 19:23.981
Oh... Oh, yeah?

19:31.088 --> 19:32.089
<i>Fuck!</i>

19:32.123 --> 19:33.590
You... fuck you!

19:33.623 --> 19:35.993
Calm your ass!
Calm the fuck down!

19:36.027 --> 19:37.895
What have you done?

19:40.464 --> 19:42.766
Did you see what you made me do?

19:43.633 --> 19:45.702
That one's on you.

19:45.735 --> 19:48.205
Put Kinkaid on the line now.

19:48.239 --> 19:49.739
I'm here.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.879
Kinkaid, I want my money.

19:54.912 --> 19:56.247
You got an hour.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.786
You SWAT guys,

20:02.819 --> 20:06.057
you're a hammer,
but not every problem is a nail.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.925
You did this.

20:12.496 --> 20:13.931
Oh, my God.

20:13.964 --> 20:15.866
Get her out of here.

20:25.675 --> 20:28.112
You bastard asshole!

20:44.428 --> 20:48.598
No! You bastard!

20:52.203 --> 20:56.806
We know all about Captain Davis,
but what do we know about the hooker?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.741
We don't know anything
about the hooker.

20:58.775 --> 21:02.012
Honestly, McMasters
is our problem.

21:02.046 --> 21:05.416
Look, it may not be in his file,

21:05.449 --> 21:07.585
but he claimed
during his last trial

21:07.617 --> 21:10.753
that he blacks out
before he kills.

21:10.787 --> 21:13.623
He killed six members
of the Stephenson family,

21:13.656 --> 21:16.393
and then he said
he didn't remember any of it.

21:16.427 --> 21:19.897
He's a killer.
They all have their story.

21:19.930 --> 21:24.401
Cindy Stephenson,
the only survivor,

21:24.435 --> 21:26.437
watched him kill
her entire family

21:26.470 --> 21:30.441
and he was armed only with
his fist while reciting Psalms Ten.

21:30.474 --> 21:33.077
Psalms 10?

21:33.110 --> 21:35.146
What the hell
does that have to do with it?

21:35.179 --> 21:39.216
It's some Psalm revolving
around evil against God and such.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.152
Some weird shit.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.623
She also said
that he appeared to be dreaming

21:45.655 --> 21:48.092
in some sort of trance,

21:48.125 --> 21:51.195
so much that he
couldn't even see her.

21:53.230 --> 21:57.301
Kinkaid... trust me...

21:58.302 --> 22:00.871
McMasters is our problem.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.990
- Chow time, huh?
- Hell yeah.

22:20.024 --> 22:23.693
- You guys feel like pizza?
- Yeah, that sounds good to me.

22:24.595 --> 22:27.932
Yeah, me too.

22:27.965 --> 22:29.466
You know, I was thinking...

22:33.103 --> 22:35.206
wasn't this your girlfriend's?

22:56.026 --> 22:57.294
Kinkaid.

22:58.596 --> 23:00.297
We're ready for lunch now.

23:00.331 --> 23:01.966
McMasters...

23:01.999 --> 23:04.101
Uh, we have sandwiches.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.437
We'll send in some sandwiches,
how's that?

23:07.404 --> 23:09.206
No, we'll take pizza, pepperoni.

23:09.240 --> 23:13.611
No, you can't just call us
and order pizza like that.

23:13.644 --> 23:16.947
Listen,
I'm in charge here, okay?

23:16.981 --> 23:18.649
And we'll take pizza.

23:18.682 --> 23:20.317
<i>No, no, I'm not doing this.</i>

23:20.351 --> 23:23.554
We'll send you in the same
sandwiches that we have.

23:23.587 --> 23:25.122
<i>That's it.</i>

23:27.391 --> 23:28.758
Guys...

23:44.742 --> 23:46.744
Tell 'em. Tell, 'em, tell 'em!

23:46.776 --> 23:48.679
You tell 'em
and they'll feed us.

23:48.712 --> 23:50.581
Yeah.

23:50.614 --> 23:51.649
Yeah.

23:51.682 --> 23:53.783
Okay.

23:53.816 --> 23:55.719
What? I can't hear you.

23:55.753 --> 23:58.355
- Okay, okay, stop.
- We're getting our pizza?

23:58.389 --> 24:00.090
We'll get you your damn pizza.

24:00.124 --> 24:01.892
Get this bitch out of my face!

24:01.925 --> 24:04.428
Take her out of here!

24:04.461 --> 24:09.166
Kinkaid, you need to start
listening to what I say!

24:10.267 --> 24:12.770
Do everything I say,
whatever I want,

24:12.802 --> 24:15.773
you give it to me, motherfucker!
You hear me?!

24:15.805 --> 24:18.442
<i>Or I'll fucking kill everybody!</i>

24:18.475 --> 24:20.711
We will all die!

24:20.744 --> 24:22.479
Fuck you!

24:28.118 --> 24:29.486
Fuck!

24:30.820 --> 24:32.289
Fuck!

24:35.326 --> 24:37.161
Fuck you!

24:51.442 --> 24:53.610
John, yeah, Kinkaid.

24:53.644 --> 24:55.646
Yeah, right.

24:55.679 --> 24:57.981
Listen, I need a favor.

24:58.015 --> 25:00.184
You gotta get us some pizzas.

25:00.884 --> 25:02.686
No, no, no, no.

25:02.720 --> 25:06.023
Just the-the real delivery boy.

25:06.056 --> 25:08.258
No, we'll take
responsibility for him.

25:08.292 --> 25:12.062
Pizzas and the delivery boy,
understand?

25:12.096 --> 25:14.865
No... no, wire,
no camera, nothing.

25:16.934 --> 25:21.438
Right. All right. We're waiting.

25:32.449 --> 25:35.285
So where do you guys
wanna start from now?

25:35.319 --> 25:37.955
I've been reading up
on McMasters' file,

25:37.988 --> 25:40.457
and he fancies himself
a lady's man.

25:40.491 --> 25:42.493
So I'm gonna give him
a chance to be one.

25:42.526 --> 25:45.295
So what are you gonna do,
flirt with him?

25:47.097 --> 25:50.100
Oh, this will be the first
flirtatious negotiation

25:50.134 --> 25:52.403
I've had the pleasure
of ever experiencing.

25:52.436 --> 25:57.107
No, I'm gonna play to his ego
and find out what started this shit.

25:57.141 --> 25:59.543
Well, let me ask you this.

25:59.576 --> 26:01.912
Do you need a moment
to put on your make up?

26:01.945 --> 26:04.081
What is that supposed to mean?

26:04.114 --> 26:06.550
Whoa, hang on.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.786
We got a real problem here.
We gotta act quickly.

26:08.819 --> 26:13.157
Did you know that McMasters
is a paranoid schizophrenic

26:13.190 --> 26:15.426
and is normally under
heavy medication?

26:15.459 --> 26:17.327
I read something
about that in his file.

26:17.361 --> 26:20.264
And claustrophobia
is part of his pathology.

26:20.297 --> 26:23.834
No. No, I didn't know that.
What's your point?

26:23.868 --> 26:27.872
His murder revolves around
his schizophrenia

26:27.906 --> 26:30.307
and it's triggered by
enclosed spaces.

26:30.340 --> 26:34.278
Okay, the bullpen
is larger than his cell.

26:34.311 --> 26:39.116
My point is that when he's in his cell,
he's getting daily medication.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.985
Son of a bitch.

26:42.019 --> 26:43.720
We are well past that now.

26:43.754 --> 26:45.956
He could explode at any moment.

26:58.769 --> 27:00.304
Look what I found.

27:00.337 --> 27:02.172
Fucking food, finally.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.909
Put that pizza there
right there.

27:04.943 --> 27:07.044
Check his ass for wires.

27:08.412 --> 27:10.013
Put your hands up.

27:12.716 --> 27:14.318
Turn around.

27:18.489 --> 27:20.324
Okay, he's clean.

27:22.726 --> 27:26.497
You're kind of cute, huh? Think I might
wanna keep you to play with you for a while.

27:26.530 --> 27:28.131
Hey, Raj, check him out.

27:28.933 --> 27:30.969
Yeah, nothing to check out.

27:31.001 --> 27:32.669
Not my style.

27:32.703 --> 27:33.972
Hey, you got me.

27:34.037 --> 27:36.773
- Leave him alone.
- Shut the fuck up and sit down.

27:36.807 --> 27:38.375
Knock it off.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.447
Pizza boy...

27:44.883 --> 27:46.650
I got a message for you.

27:49.753 --> 27:54.191
It's for Roger Kinkaid,
the FBI agent in charge out there.

27:54.224 --> 27:59.196
You tell him
Mike McMasters says hello.

28:00.564 --> 28:05.469
And that I'm right here
whenever he wants to see me.

28:08.006 --> 28:09.874
And you let him know

28:09.908 --> 28:14.144
that his captain and all
his fellow officers are okay.

28:14.177 --> 28:16.580
Everyone's fine.

28:16.613 --> 28:19.783
And remind him
about the money he owes me.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.387
Can you do that for me?

28:31.595 --> 28:33.597
Don't fuck up.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.735
Now if I were you,
I'd pick that up.

28:41.138 --> 28:42.806
Get the fuck out of here.

29:02.326 --> 29:03.928
It's a shame your lady

29:03.962 --> 29:05.696
isn't gonna get down
on this pizza.

29:05.729 --> 29:06.763
You hungry?

29:08.699 --> 29:09.934
You okay?

29:09.968 --> 29:11.735
Hey, you okay?

29:27.217 --> 29:30.487
You, my friend...

29:34.491 --> 29:35.525
Where's Falcon?

29:36.894 --> 29:38.295
Where's Falcon?!

29:40.230 --> 29:41.531
They-they killed her, Captain.

29:41.565 --> 29:44.668
- What?
- They fucking killed her!

29:47.471 --> 29:48.906
Fuck you!

29:48.940 --> 29:51.075
Go and shoot me!
Fucking shoot me!

29:51.109 --> 29:53.111
No, you-you bastards.

29:53.143 --> 29:55.113
You fucking bastards!

29:55.145 --> 29:57.848
You fucking mother
son of a bitch,

29:57.882 --> 30:00.183
McMasters, you're gonna fry!

30:00.217 --> 30:01.718
You are so gonna fucking fry,

30:01.752 --> 30:04.154
and I'm gonna put the needle
in your arm my fucking self!

30:04.187 --> 30:06.790
Or I'll fucking kill you myself
right fucking now,

30:06.823 --> 30:08.126
you fucking asshole!

30:08.158 --> 30:10.827
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you! Fuck...

30:12.864 --> 30:14.331
Fuck you!

30:14.364 --> 30:17.834
Shut the fuck up!
I will fucking kill you!

30:17.869 --> 30:19.779
If I just wanna kill anybody,
I'm gonna kill you!

30:19.803 --> 30:22.372
You got that?
You fucking piece of shit!

30:22.406 --> 30:25.409
- Fuck you!
- No, please, no!

30:25.442 --> 30:26.543
Sit down.

30:32.349 --> 30:34.384
- No.
- What's your problem?

30:36.653 --> 30:39.857
You think...
You think I'm afraid of you?

30:39.891 --> 30:44.461
No. You're a bastard,
but I lived with one.

30:45.228 --> 30:48.432
Yeah? What was he like?

30:49.399 --> 30:51.468
My daughter's father.

30:51.501 --> 30:54.571
I thought I married a good man

30:54.604 --> 30:57.975
and we were gonna live
happily after.

30:58.009 --> 31:03.981
But, you know, he's like you,
lunatic motherfucker serial killer.

31:04.015 --> 31:08.385
- Yeah.
- You know, he turned on me.

31:08.418 --> 31:12.990
- Good.
- Just when my daughter turned one year old.

31:13.024 --> 31:17.360
That night he...
I never seen that face.

31:19.730 --> 31:23.600
One hand had gun,
the other hand he had a scissor.

31:23.633 --> 31:27.504
And he pointed at me,
asked me to choose.

31:28.906 --> 31:33.543
You know, you kill me
or kill my daughter.

31:34.145 --> 31:35.980
What'd you choose?

31:39.150 --> 31:40.918
Come on, what you choose?

31:40.952 --> 31:43.487
I couldn't, I wouldn't.

31:44.621 --> 31:46.224
He's a bastard.

31:46.256 --> 31:49.326
I got lucky
but it was a nightmare.

31:51.062 --> 31:54.232
You know why I like him?

31:54.264 --> 31:56.134
He's passionate.

31:56.167 --> 31:58.936
Turns me on just like you.

31:58.970 --> 32:00.403
Just like me, huh?

32:05.509 --> 32:07.778
You're just a fucking whore.

32:08.913 --> 32:10.480
Only a whore.

32:10.514 --> 32:12.449
You know what happened to him?

32:12.482 --> 32:15.318
What? What happened?

32:16.453 --> 32:20.490
He got crushed by a car,
terrible accident.

32:20.524 --> 32:23.227
You know, life's a bitch, right?

32:23.261 --> 32:24.896
Huh?

32:26.164 --> 32:28.933
- Yeah, it is.
- Hey.

32:28.966 --> 32:31.235
- Hey.
- What, what?

32:31.269 --> 32:34.939
If I fuck you,
you're not gonna hurt me, right?

32:34.972 --> 32:37.074
If I fuck you, no?

32:38.075 --> 32:40.278
- No.
- No.

32:40.310 --> 32:42.612
- No, great.
- I won't hurt you.

32:44.347 --> 32:45.849
I'll fuck you.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.789
If I fuck you...

32:54.391 --> 32:58.095
I will have no choice
but to hurt you.

32:58.129 --> 32:59.663
Do you understand?

32:59.696 --> 33:02.967
- I'll fuck you good.
- Yes.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.036
- Yes.
- Yeah.

33:08.371 --> 33:10.540
We're good, right?

33:11.775 --> 33:13.144
Yeah.

33:13.177 --> 33:15.112
Yeah, you can have some pizza.

33:44.108 --> 33:48.913
Kinkaid,
your time's running out.

33:48.946 --> 33:50.480
You have my demands?

33:50.513 --> 33:52.016
<i>We have the money,</i>

33:52.049 --> 33:54.851
<i>but you're gonna
have to wait five minutes.</i>

33:54.886 --> 33:57.188
I want everything,

33:57.221 --> 33:59.957
and if I don't get it
in five minutes,

33:59.991 --> 34:02.492
another one
of your people's gonna die.

34:12.036 --> 34:13.137
Hey.

34:14.804 --> 34:15.873
Hey.

34:18.242 --> 34:19.809
Why don't you let us go?

34:22.079 --> 34:23.713
Please, please.

34:23.747 --> 34:26.984
I've tortured and killed
a lot of people in my life,

34:27.018 --> 34:31.688
especially liked killing
those young sorority girls.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.557
And I've always
wanted to kill a cop.

34:36.227 --> 34:39.397
Not a fast death,
you understand?

34:39.429 --> 34:43.767
A slow, agonizing death.

34:45.002 --> 34:47.071
One to remember, huh?

34:47.104 --> 34:52.176
I wanna feel your pain
for the rest of my life.

34:56.846 --> 35:01.851
Maybe if you entertain me,
I'll just permanently disable you, huh?

35:09.260 --> 35:12.029
That's it, decided.

35:12.063 --> 35:15.465
You two will be my first cops.

35:16.733 --> 35:20.537
It's gonna be a fuckin' miracle.

35:21.172 --> 35:22.940
It's gonna be great!

35:24.841 --> 35:25.675
I can't wait.

35:25.709 --> 35:28.346
Hey, hey, come on, man.

35:28.379 --> 35:30.714
Quit fucking around.

35:30.747 --> 35:33.117
Even you don't
wanna kill two cops.

35:34.318 --> 35:35.819
That's insane.

35:37.721 --> 35:40.690
- Come on, stop.
- Cortez, stop.

35:40.724 --> 35:43.060
- He ain't screwing around.
- Of course he is,

35:43.094 --> 35:47.365
- he's just trying...
- Listen to your friend, bitch!

35:47.398 --> 35:51.869
This ain't no goddamn game...
we're playing.

36:03.180 --> 36:04.547
What the hell just happened?

36:04.581 --> 36:07.584
- God. Shut the fuck up.
- No.

36:07.617 --> 36:09.053
He's gonna come back here,

36:09.086 --> 36:11.889
he's gonna torture us
and then he's gonna kill us.

36:11.922 --> 36:14.067
- Do you get the picture?
- No, no. He's not... He's not...

36:14.091 --> 36:15.259
He doesn't wanna...

36:16.260 --> 36:19.930
Get this whiney bitch out of
here now.

36:21.831 --> 36:25.702
No, no, Osborn, Osborn!
Stop, please!

36:25.735 --> 36:27.537
McMasters...

36:28.873 --> 36:31.708
If you kill...
If you kill another cop...

36:32.977 --> 36:35.446
they're not gonna
give you anything. Nothing.

36:35.479 --> 36:37.714
Davis! Whitney!

36:37.747 --> 36:39.383
They're gonna fuck you up!

36:39.417 --> 36:41.751
Fucking psycho!

36:41.785 --> 36:43.120
Yeah?

36:43.154 --> 36:45.056
But you know what
they're gonna give you?

36:46.957 --> 36:49.493
You're a fucking psycho!

36:52.430 --> 36:55.732
Captain John Davis,

36:55.765 --> 37:00.104
we award you
with the badge of disgrace

37:00.137 --> 37:04.508
'cause you couldn't keep your family
alive when they needed you most!

37:04.542 --> 37:06.310
Shut the fuck up!

37:06.343 --> 37:08.212
You're a stupid motherfucker

37:08.245 --> 37:13.884
lunatic psychopath racist
white trash asshole!

37:13.918 --> 37:15.019
That's you.

37:15.052 --> 37:19.589
Shut the fuck up,
before I fuck you and kill you.

37:19.622 --> 37:22.393
No, you will not
because I fuck good.

37:22.426 --> 37:24.028
You will not kill me,
I fuck good.

37:24.061 --> 37:25.662
You will not kill me,
you know that?

37:25.695 --> 37:27.465
Ehh. Fuck you.

37:27.498 --> 37:30.534
Fucking asshole. Come fuck me.

37:30.568 --> 37:32.436
Come fuck me, you motherfucking.

37:32.470 --> 37:34.138
- Fuck you, asshole.
- Fuck you, bitch.

37:34.171 --> 37:38.242
Fuck me, come.
Come here. Fucking asshole.

37:38.275 --> 37:40.377
Come, come, come, come.

39:06.597 --> 39:08.866
You two stay here.

39:08.899 --> 39:11.268
I got some business
to take care of with this bitch.

39:14.338 --> 39:16.040
Not you, bitch.

39:17.575 --> 39:18.808
You.

39:42.299 --> 39:45.903
- Hey, promise me one thing.
- Whatever you want.

39:45.936 --> 39:48.838
I'll only fuck you,
not the other guys, okay?

39:48.872 --> 39:50.908
Whatever you say.

39:54.612 --> 39:55.980
Pick me up.

40:01.552 --> 40:04.855
McMasters...

40:04.888 --> 40:06.823
Slow, slow, slow.

40:06.857 --> 40:10.361
Slow down. I'm yours.

40:10.394 --> 40:12.196
You're in charge.

40:14.898 --> 40:17.368
I'm only yours. Shh.

40:17.401 --> 40:20.137
I fuck good. Fuck me.

40:31.548 --> 40:33.284
Yes, sir.

40:38.922 --> 40:42.393
Man, I'm getting a piece
of that ass if it kills me.

40:43.861 --> 40:46.297
He might kill you, too.

40:46.330 --> 40:48.332
You think
that damn freak McMasters

40:48.365 --> 40:50.501
is gonna share
his piece of ass with you?

40:50.534 --> 40:52.436
Who's fucking you?

40:55.572 --> 40:57.608
I fuck good,
I'm your fucking bitch!

40:57.641 --> 40:59.476
Fuck!

40:59.510 --> 41:02.212
You asshole!

41:07.518 --> 41:08.886
You dumbasses.

41:08.919 --> 41:11.455
McMasters doesn't
give a shit about you.

41:15.192 --> 41:17.761
He's like my brother.
I know he's gonna share with me.

41:17.795 --> 41:19.829
Not a chance, dude.

41:19.863 --> 41:23.133
No man shares his spoils.
No man.

41:23.167 --> 41:26.870
That damn whore
is playin' hard, he's hers.

41:26.904 --> 41:28.572
Listen to that shit.

41:28.605 --> 41:30.374
Slow down, slick.

41:30.407 --> 41:33.444
Take your time, McMasters.

41:33.477 --> 41:36.880
You can fuck me as long
as you want any time you want.

41:36.914 --> 41:40.184
But promise,
promise I only fuck you.

41:40.217 --> 41:42.753
- Not the other guys, promise.
- Fuck me.

41:42.786 --> 41:45.189
- Promise you, asshole, promise.
- I promise!

41:52.396 --> 41:55.866
You ain't heard nothing yet.
Wait till I'm up in there.

41:57.368 --> 41:58.969
Yeah, right.

42:08.112 --> 42:10.881
Fuck you, motherfucker.

42:17.654 --> 42:19.858
Oh, yeah.

42:19.890 --> 42:22.993
- Fuck.
- You're my bitch.

42:23.026 --> 42:25.829
I'm your fucking bitch.

42:25.864 --> 42:27.564
But not others, okay?

42:27.598 --> 42:30.401
No...

42:30.434 --> 42:31.870
I wanna please only you.

42:31.902 --> 42:34.905
Yeah... come on.

42:35.706 --> 42:37.241
I fuck good, right?

42:37.274 --> 42:38.308
You fuck good.

42:56.326 --> 42:57.394
What?

42:58.429 --> 42:59.663
Nothing.

43:02.099 --> 43:03.534
You have something to do, right?

43:04.568 --> 43:05.969
Yeah, man.

43:12.476 --> 43:13.944
Do it.

43:24.087 --> 43:27.224
Got lip...
My lipstick's all over you.

43:42.306 --> 43:43.974
Why don't you go ahead
and have a seat?

43:50.781 --> 43:53.217
Who are you
pointing that gun at?

45:16.901 --> 45:18.235
McMasters.

45:18.903 --> 45:21.071
McMasters, get up!

45:24.508 --> 45:25.542
Hey.

45:28.078 --> 45:31.448
Where is our money?

45:31.481 --> 45:32.583
You...

45:33.417 --> 45:35.053
What'd you just say to me, man?

45:35.085 --> 45:36.787
Take it easy, man.

45:36.820 --> 45:38.322
Calm down.

45:39.456 --> 45:40.824
Take it easy.

45:40.858 --> 45:42.526
Easy, man.

45:48.967 --> 45:50.467
No reason to worry.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.869
What happened?

46:00.644 --> 46:03.948
It's okay, man, don't worry.
Just calm down.

46:03.982 --> 46:05.415
No reason to worry.

46:08.852 --> 46:09.887
Huh?

47:25.997 --> 47:27.230
Kinkaid here.

47:27.264 --> 47:29.332
McMasters.

47:32.202 --> 47:34.271
You got the demands?

47:35.305 --> 47:37.075
They're on their way.

47:37.108 --> 47:40.044
<i>I'm gonna need my medication.</i>

47:40.078 --> 47:42.080
I know,
your meds are on the way.

47:42.113 --> 47:48.452
I need it now...
or everybody is gonna die.

47:49.219 --> 47:50.821
<i>Medication.</i>

47:51.354 --> 47:52.990
My medication.

47:54.158 --> 47:55.392
Now.

48:11.541 --> 48:15.612
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll whack himself.

48:18.082 --> 48:19.984
Sounds like he's losing it.

48:20.017 --> 48:24.287
Goddammit, fuck! Shit, fuck!

48:36.533 --> 48:38.602
We're gonna get them all killed.

48:41.239 --> 48:42.539
Don't talk like that.

49:02.960 --> 49:03.995
Come on.

49:10.634 --> 49:11.768
Come on.

49:30.288 --> 49:33.191
What exactly
is your fucking problem?

49:33.224 --> 49:34.926
We gotta move faster.

49:34.959 --> 49:37.862
Snake, I need you
to do negotiations, please.

49:37.895 --> 49:39.030
Yeah.

49:40.097 --> 49:42.166
I'll get us out of here.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.601
- You just...
- No, no, no, no, no.

49:46.270 --> 49:48.471
You don't understand, man.

49:48.505 --> 49:50.875
I gotta get out of here, now.

49:50.908 --> 49:55.612
If I move too fast, we're gonna
end up right back in this fuckin' place.

49:56.413 --> 49:58.381
Just calm down.

49:58.415 --> 50:00.584
I can't stay calm.

50:22.405 --> 50:25.877
I need my medication.

50:25.910 --> 50:30.081
I need to get out of here
if I don't have my medication.

50:30.114 --> 50:31.883
I gotta go, now.

50:31.916 --> 50:35.019
You're gonna have to get
your shit under control, man.

50:35.052 --> 50:36.686
I'll get us out of here.

50:38.122 --> 50:39.556
Don't touch me.

50:41.259 --> 50:44.694
I'll get your meds,
you got that?

50:45.428 --> 50:46.596
Now come on.

50:46.630 --> 50:47.965
No.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.734
I'm gonna stay here.

50:58.742 --> 51:01.245
There's too many people
out there.

51:01.279 --> 51:03.147
McMasters.

51:10.121 --> 51:11.554
Dammit.

51:13.991 --> 51:15.026
Fuck.

51:23.334 --> 51:25.468
Hey, Raj, leave the bitch alone.

51:27.104 --> 51:28.638
McMasters is sick,
I'm in charge.

51:28.672 --> 51:31.375
- Who said?
- I did.

51:31.409 --> 51:33.443
So you're the one
who's gonna get me my money now?

51:33.476 --> 51:36.813
I'm gonna get the money for us,
not for you, for us.

51:36.846 --> 51:39.783
Get on with it, shit's taken
long enough already.

51:58.835 --> 52:01.838
- Who's this?
- This is Kinkaid.

52:02.873 --> 52:05.076
Can we talk about
how this all got started?

52:05.109 --> 52:10.081
I mean, whose idea was it to
rush the bullpen, take hostages?

52:12.116 --> 52:13.284
McMasters?

52:13.317 --> 52:15.585
Kinkaid, this is Snake.

52:15.618 --> 52:18.255
McMasters is sick,
he needs his meds.

52:18.289 --> 52:20.091
<i>He's strugglin'.</i>

52:20.124 --> 52:22.492
<i>I, uh... I was just...</i>

52:22.525 --> 52:24.895
I saw that in his file.

52:24.929 --> 52:27.198
But even if he
took them right now

52:27.231 --> 52:29.967
it would take a while for them
to build up in his system.

52:30.001 --> 52:33.104
- You understand?
- I want it now.

52:33.137 --> 52:34.939
How about...

52:36.340 --> 52:40.478
How about if we transferred you
to a minimum security prison,

52:40.510 --> 52:41.778
would that help things along?

52:41.811 --> 52:43.147
Transfer?

52:43.180 --> 52:45.548
He'd never go for transfer.

52:45.582 --> 52:48.618
We want money
and safe passage in Mexico.

52:48.651 --> 52:52.555
$4 million,
a helicopter, Mexico.

52:53.991 --> 52:57.594
I could promise you
that I would do my best.

52:57.627 --> 52:59.864
But you know
that's not gonna happen, right?

52:59.897 --> 53:01.432
Man, you don't got much time.

53:01.465 --> 53:03.467
I'm not asking you
to sell out your friends.

53:03.501 --> 53:06.137
I know you're not
that kind of guy.

53:06.170 --> 53:10.840
But Raj and McMasters,

53:10.875 --> 53:13.411
<i>they're a whole another story.</i>

53:13.444 --> 53:15.645
<i>Before you say anything,</i>

53:15.678 --> 53:18.115
<i>I'd like to tell you
something man to man.</i>

53:18.149 --> 53:23.220
I'm so glad that you've
taken over the situation.

53:23.254 --> 53:27.324
I mean, you're the only
rational mind in the room,

53:27.358 --> 53:29.026
you know what I mean?

53:30.194 --> 53:31.694
And I'll make you this promise.

53:31.728 --> 53:35.933
I will get you those meds
as soon as possible.

53:36.867 --> 53:38.302
Okay?

53:38.335 --> 53:40.004
Hurry up, please.

53:43.507 --> 53:44.542
That's a win.

53:44.574 --> 53:46.676
Huge win.

53:53.084 --> 53:55.352
Raj, go check on
that son of a bitch.

53:55.386 --> 53:57.754
- He's flipping out in there.
- Why don't you do it?

53:57.787 --> 54:01.791
'Cause I said for you to.
Do you understand me?

54:03.094 --> 54:04.727
Damn bullshit.

54:04.761 --> 54:06.763
It's just starting right now.

54:21.278 --> 54:22.679
McMasters.

54:24.515 --> 54:26.417
McMasters.

54:26.450 --> 54:28.219
- You okay?
- Who are you?

54:29.153 --> 54:30.787
Raj.

54:32.256 --> 54:34.724
- Who?
- Raj, man.

54:34.757 --> 54:37.727
- You all right?
- You got my meds?

54:37.760 --> 54:39.662
We're working on it,
just give it a beat.

54:39.696 --> 54:41.565
- We're working on it.
- Give me my meds, man.

54:41.599 --> 54:43.968
Put the gun down, man.
Chill out, dude.

54:44.001 --> 54:45.912
- Give me my fucking meds.
- We're working on the meds.

54:45.936 --> 54:48.139
Put the fucking gun down, man.

55:09.326 --> 55:11.929
Who gave you the authority
to promise him meds?

55:11.962 --> 55:14.398
What the hell do you
think you're doing, Kinkaid?

55:14.431 --> 55:16.634
I'm trying to stop a bloodbath.

55:16.666 --> 55:20.271
Kinkaid's taking over
the negotiations.

55:20.304 --> 55:23.207
Let's just get these meds
ready for delivery.

55:23.240 --> 55:28.012
No. There will be
no meds delivered.

55:28.045 --> 55:31.549
Do you understand the extent
of the situation over there?

55:31.582 --> 55:33.584
Nothing will be
given to that group

55:33.617 --> 55:35.752
without concessions
on their part.

55:35.785 --> 55:41.091
If McMasters goes psychotic, there'll
be no negotiations just an aftermath.

55:41.125 --> 55:44.061
My position
is not up for debate.

55:46.130 --> 55:47.264
From here on out,

55:47.298 --> 55:49.533
this situation will be
handled by the book.

55:49.567 --> 55:51.768
No concessions.

56:05.382 --> 56:06.716
Snake.

56:09.687 --> 56:14.892
Look, I know you and McMasters
go back a long ways.

56:15.993 --> 56:19.697
That dude's lost it
and that's a big problem.

56:19.729 --> 56:23.701
But Kinkaid said he's gonna get the
meds. I know he's gonna come through.

56:23.733 --> 56:26.170
Yeah, well he better
and quickly.

56:26.203 --> 56:28.738
Otherwise we're gonna have to
take out that damn freak ourselves.

56:28.771 --> 56:30.840
You saw how he
pulled his guns on us.

56:30.874 --> 56:33.978
What the fuck are you afraid of?
You've got a gun, too.

56:34.912 --> 56:36.580
Get in there and watch him.

56:36.614 --> 56:38.983
Just don't fucking kill him.

56:39.016 --> 56:43.020
You wanna take all the fun
out of this for me, huh?

56:43.053 --> 56:46.190
Look, I don't give a shit.

56:46.223 --> 56:49.759
I'm not sure which one
of you assholes scares me more.

57:07.978 --> 57:09.647
Just hang in there, Cherry.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.982
They're gonna get us
out of here, I promise.

57:13.050 --> 57:15.785
I'll be dead by then.

57:15.818 --> 57:17.721
No, you won't.

57:17.755 --> 57:20.257
Just hang in there,
just a little longer.

57:20.291 --> 57:22.026
It'll be over soon.

57:22.059 --> 57:24.161
Think about your daughter.

57:24.194 --> 57:28.065
I am, but I'm not sure
I can get out of this.

57:28.098 --> 57:31.769
Please, and I'll be
any good for anyone.

57:31.801 --> 57:36.340
Just a little longer.
It'll be over soon.

57:38.676 --> 57:40.678
Davis, can you see it?

57:40.711 --> 57:42.913
They're screwing
this whole thing up.

57:42.946 --> 57:45.115
They're gonna get us killed.

58:00.297 --> 58:03.067
What you're proposing
is gonna get people killed.

58:03.100 --> 58:04.601
It's gonna get cops killed.

58:04.635 --> 58:07.938
And I don't think it's legal
to withhold meds from this man.

58:07.971 --> 58:10.774
Is that how you feel also?

58:10.808 --> 58:14.678
Rodriguez, mistakes were made.

58:14.712 --> 58:16.313
It happens in a negotiation.

58:16.347 --> 58:18.749
It's the nature of the game,
come on.

58:18.782 --> 58:21.151
Nothing will be
sent to that bullpen.

58:21.185 --> 58:24.988
No more food, no water. Nothing.

58:25.022 --> 58:31.295
And there will be no more communication
with that bullpen until they call us.

58:31.328 --> 58:35.065
Your hard line approach
is gonna blow up in our faces.

59:00.958 --> 59:03.293
What's so damn funny?

59:04.628 --> 59:06.163
What's funny?

59:06.196 --> 59:08.565
Your so called leader
is back there losing it.

59:08.599 --> 59:13.103
He's gonna get you both killed
or kill you both himself.

59:15.272 --> 59:16.774
Shut up!

1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:06.290
Fuck! Fuck!

1:00:10.828 --> 1:00:12.796
Fuck, man.

1:00:12.830 --> 1:00:14.498
I need to get control.

1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:18.836
I have to take control
of the situation.

1:00:28.378 --> 1:00:29.546
Fuck.

1:00:31.950 --> 1:00:33.350
Fuck.

1:01:06.350 --> 1:01:09.988
Snake, may I talk to you?

1:01:10.020 --> 1:01:11.021
What do you want?

1:01:11.054 --> 1:01:12.489
It's about Davis.

1:01:12.523 --> 1:01:16.560
He's in a very bad shape.
He's unconscious.

1:01:16.593 --> 1:01:19.964
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, no, I swear.

1:01:19.998 --> 1:01:22.699
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

1:01:25.168 --> 1:01:28.539
- Please help.
- I'll take care of this.

1:01:28.572 --> 1:01:30.207
Thank you.

1:01:52.329 --> 1:01:54.999
Snake, this is Rodriguez.

1:01:55.033 --> 1:01:58.669
<i>Who is this?
Every time I call it's a new bullshitter.</i>

1:01:58.702 --> 1:02:00.203
What can I do for you, Snake?

1:02:00.237 --> 1:02:02.406
I asked for some meds.

1:02:02.439 --> 1:02:06.209
And I gotta tell you one of
your hostages is in bad shape.

1:02:11.715 --> 1:02:14.318
So are you offering me
Captain Davis for the meds?

1:02:14.351 --> 1:02:17.454
No, I'm just
giving you information.

1:02:18.856 --> 1:02:21.291
Well, if you want the meds,

1:02:21.325 --> 1:02:23.160
you're gonna have to
give us the captain.

1:02:23.193 --> 1:02:26.663
I don't give a damn
about the meds.

1:02:26.697 --> 1:02:31.268
The captain on the other hand,
you want him, make an offer.

1:02:32.669 --> 1:02:34.805
I don't give a fuck
if he dies or not.

1:02:36.406 --> 1:02:40.577
Well, Snake, you do know
that it's murder?

1:02:40.611 --> 1:02:43.647
Look, dumb-ass, who do you
think you're dealing with?

1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:47.651
We're facing life no matter what
happens if we ever get out of here.

1:02:50.387 --> 1:02:51.822
Let me call you back, Snake.

1:02:51.856 --> 1:02:53.624
Suit yourself.

1:03:01.065 --> 1:03:03.333
What are you
gonna offer him now?

1:03:05.268 --> 1:03:07.237
The meds for the captain.

1:03:08.739 --> 1:03:11.742
You know the difference
between you and Kinkaid?

1:03:11.775 --> 1:03:13.310
Hm?

1:03:13.343 --> 1:03:16.948
Kinkaid recognized that he
underestimated that asshole.

1:03:16.981 --> 1:03:18.749
He actually gave a damn.

1:03:18.782 --> 1:03:21.818
You're too arrogant to recognize
or care about anything.

1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:25.756
I can have you removed.

1:03:25.789 --> 1:03:27.925
You have no authority over me.

1:03:27.959 --> 1:03:30.460
You have no authority over me!

1:03:31.395 --> 1:03:33.965
I'm losing, I'm losing.

1:03:33.998 --> 1:03:37.200
If there is a God
I will believe in you.

1:03:37.234 --> 1:03:41.271
Please send me magic and power.
Get me out of here.

1:03:41.304 --> 1:03:43.640
Please. Please.

1:03:58.288 --> 1:04:01.458
Snake, may I go to the bathroom?

1:04:04.996 --> 1:04:06.030
Yeah.

1:04:06.064 --> 1:04:08.598
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1:04:12.636 --> 1:04:14.838
Please... Please, don't hurt me.

1:04:14.872 --> 1:04:16.908
Don't hurt me.

1:04:18.308 --> 1:04:21.411
Save that bullshit
for McMasters.

1:04:21.445 --> 1:04:23.014
I don't wanna hurt you.

1:04:23.047 --> 1:04:24.982
I don't wanna fuck you.

1:04:25.016 --> 1:04:28.152
Torture, pain.

1:04:28.186 --> 1:04:31.722
That's what I want.
That's what I need.

1:04:35.126 --> 1:04:37.095
Relax, I'm not going anywhere.

1:04:37.128 --> 1:04:38.762
I'm not.

1:04:40.164 --> 1:04:42.532
You know what your problem is?

1:04:42.566 --> 1:04:45.469
You try so hard to be in control
but you're not in control.

1:04:45.502 --> 1:04:50.540
Let me tell you this.
I'm a fucking whore.

1:04:50.574 --> 1:04:53.677
If I fuck one more man,
doesn't make any difference.

1:04:53.710 --> 1:04:57.014
But it will make difference
for you, remember that.

1:04:57.048 --> 1:04:59.217
If you fuck me right now,

1:04:59.249 --> 1:05:03.855
you lose control over me
and get fucking punished.

1:05:17.367 --> 1:05:19.636
I'm done with you.

1:05:47.865 --> 1:05:49.000
What are you doing?

1:05:49.766 --> 1:05:52.569
Get out there, now!

1:06:14.324 --> 1:06:15.358
Who's this?

1:06:15.392 --> 1:06:17.360
This is Rodriguez.

1:06:17.394 --> 1:06:18.695
I'm calling to make an offer.

1:06:18.728 --> 1:06:20.932
Look, I wanna talk to Kinkaid.

1:06:20.965 --> 1:06:22.632
Kinkaid here.

1:06:22.666 --> 1:06:25.937
I've got somebody here
who wants to talk to you.

1:06:25.970 --> 1:06:27.104
Hold on.

1:06:34.245 --> 1:06:37.114
<i>Is this FBI Agent Kinkaid?</i>

1:06:38.316 --> 1:06:40.517
Yes, this is Kinkaid.
Who is this?

1:06:41.852 --> 1:06:43.787
Nice to hear your voice.

1:06:43.820 --> 1:06:45.223
It's Cherry.

1:06:45.256 --> 1:06:47.892
I wanna talk to you about Davis,
the captain.

1:06:47.925 --> 1:06:49.559
I'm listening.

1:06:49.593 --> 1:06:52.230
<i>I think he'll die if he
doesn't go to see a doctor.</i>

1:06:52.263 --> 1:06:56.633
And he's breathing very poor

1:06:56.666 --> 1:06:59.937
and right now
he's suddenly unconscious.

1:07:01.605 --> 1:07:04.876
Cherry, how are you?
Have they hurt you?

1:07:04.909 --> 1:07:08.079
I'm... I'm, uh...

1:07:11.315 --> 1:07:13.918
I'm fine, I'll be fine.

1:07:22.226 --> 1:07:23.793
So what's your offer?

1:07:24.694 --> 1:07:25.829
So, Snake,

1:07:25.863 --> 1:07:30.334
the offer is
meds for the captain.

1:07:30.368 --> 1:07:32.569
Look, this is how it is.

1:07:32.602 --> 1:07:36.240
In an hour I give Davis to Raj
to use as a toy.

1:07:36.274 --> 1:07:37.975
Then I give Cherry to McMasters.

1:07:38.009 --> 1:07:41.845
Now I want those meds and food,
then we'll talk.

1:07:52.056 --> 1:07:54.125
I had a rapport with Snake.

1:07:55.927 --> 1:07:57.527
Good job.

1:09:20.878 --> 1:09:23.613
It's been a few minutes
since the food was delivered.

1:09:23.646 --> 1:09:25.182
You wanna check in now?

1:09:26.217 --> 1:09:29.753
Uh... Yeah.

1:09:37.261 --> 1:09:41.032
- Who is it this time?
<i>- Snake, it's Kinkaid.</i>

1:09:42.133 --> 1:09:43.566
The food okay?

1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:45.169
Yeah, man, it's good.

1:09:45.202 --> 1:09:51.208
Now, I-I sent you, uh,
a gesture of good faith.

1:09:51.242 --> 1:09:52.776
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

1:09:53.477 --> 1:09:55.079
Meds for McMasters.

1:09:55.112 --> 1:09:58.648
<i>It's in one
of the food containers.</i>

1:09:58.681 --> 1:10:01.485
Hey, Kinkaid, I appreciate it.
Thanks, man.

1:10:01.519 --> 1:10:03.888
All right, now listen, uh,

1:10:03.921 --> 1:10:07.258
you give me a call
when you're ready to talk.

1:10:07.291 --> 1:10:09.126
<i>Yeah, I'll do that.</i>

1:10:18.135 --> 1:10:23.074
Chris, could we put together
a list of potential prisons

1:10:23.107 --> 1:10:25.242
that we could
transfer these guys to?

1:10:25.276 --> 1:10:27.677
Sure, I can do that.

1:10:27.710 --> 1:10:30.915
McMasters is gonna be
especially difficult though.

1:10:32.582 --> 1:10:37.687
You know, I must admit,
Snakes' demeanor changed.

1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:41.192
But those meds were
our biggest bargaining chip.

1:10:41.225 --> 1:10:42.460
And now they're gone.

1:10:42.493 --> 1:10:46.696
I think the bigger question
is did we get it to him in time?

1:10:47.465 --> 1:10:49.666
Yeah.

1:10:49.699 --> 1:10:52.536
Kinkaid said they put a
tranquilizer in a food container.

1:10:52.570 --> 1:10:54.105
Did we throw that shit away?

1:10:54.138 --> 1:10:55.605
Yeah.

1:11:03.646 --> 1:11:05.282
Ah, shit.

1:11:17.094 --> 1:11:19.597
Man, there's only one in here.

1:11:19.629 --> 1:11:21.398
I hope this shit works.

1:11:22.099 --> 1:11:23.267
Damn straight.

1:11:23.300 --> 1:11:24.568
Look, I ain't scared of much,

1:11:24.602 --> 1:11:27.505
but that son of a bitch
scares the shit out of me.

1:11:27.538 --> 1:11:29.373
When are we gettin' to Mexico?

1:11:29.406 --> 1:11:32.076
Soon. Very soon.

1:11:45.089 --> 1:11:46.590
<i>You got Kinkaid.</i>

1:11:46.624 --> 1:11:48.159
Hey, Kinkaid, listen, uh,

1:11:48.192 --> 1:11:50.561
I need to get Davis
out of here to a doctor.

1:11:50.594 --> 1:11:52.563
Man, I got two problems though.

1:11:52.596 --> 1:11:54.031
<i>What are the problems?</i>

1:11:54.064 --> 1:11:56.666
Look, these two think
we're headed to Mexico.

1:11:56.699 --> 1:12:01.338
And if I give up Davis,
they're gonna want answers.

1:12:01.372 --> 1:12:03.806
- <i>Are they armed?</i>
- Yes.

1:12:05.409 --> 1:12:07.178
<i>Snake, this is the deal:</i>

1:12:08.778 --> 1:12:12.183
<i>I can get you into
a minimum security prison.</i>

1:12:13.584 --> 1:12:16.554
<i>Will Raj go for the same deal?</i>

1:12:16.587 --> 1:12:19.156
Man, if he doesn't
I'm gonna have to kill him.

1:12:19.190 --> 1:12:23.527
I have no idea what I'm gonna be
dealing with once McMasters wakes up.

1:12:23.561 --> 1:12:27.398
<i>There's nothing I can do with
McMasters. No one will take him.</i>

1:12:29.366 --> 1:12:31.902
<i>Now, you give me, Davis,</i>

1:12:31.936 --> 1:12:36.307
<i>and I'll get you and Raj
into minimum security prisons.</i>

1:12:36.340 --> 1:12:37.341
<i>That's the deal.</i>

1:12:37.374 --> 1:12:40.177
<i>But you've got to
convince Raj, okay?</i>

1:12:40.211 --> 1:12:42.779
Yeah, that sounds good.

1:12:56.961 --> 1:12:59.029
I'm worried about Snake.

1:13:00.064 --> 1:13:02.967
He's the most rational
of the three, but...

1:13:04.935 --> 1:13:07.671
he sounded scared of Raj.

1:13:07.705 --> 1:13:11.075
I just wonder
how persuasive Snake can be.

1:13:23.153 --> 1:13:26.557
You said we'd be out of this
shit hole and in Mexico by now.

1:13:26.590 --> 1:13:29.792
That was the motherfucking deal,
period.

1:13:30.793 --> 1:13:34.797
Between him
and the two cops we killed,

1:13:34.831 --> 1:13:36.766
this deal went south.

1:13:36.799 --> 1:13:39.570
So the plan's changed now, huh?

1:13:39.603 --> 1:13:43.340
It's because of you and
McMasters that this deal's dead.

1:13:43.374 --> 1:13:47.044
You know what,
fuck the cops, fuck McMasters.

1:13:47.077 --> 1:13:50.481
Why did the plan change, huh?
Was it because of that whore?

1:13:50.514 --> 1:13:53.417
Mesmerized her with your voodoo
like she did him?

1:13:53.450 --> 1:13:54.851
Let me tell you something.

1:13:54.885 --> 1:13:57.921
If I go to prison,
that bitch dies.

1:13:57.955 --> 1:14:02.026
Raj, minimum security prison.

1:14:02.059 --> 1:14:04.728
It's a fucking country club,
that's what our offer is.

1:14:04.762 --> 1:14:06.664
It's life, Snake.

1:14:06.697 --> 1:14:09.533
We'll still be
in prison for life.

1:14:09.566 --> 1:14:12.835
You guys have life,
I had short time.

1:14:12.870 --> 1:14:15.339
- You guys had life.
- Yeah, I had life.

1:14:15.372 --> 1:14:17.541
That's why I listened
to you and McMasters.

1:14:17.574 --> 1:14:19.410
We're supposed to be in Mexico.

1:14:19.443 --> 1:14:23.213
You know what, I think
I can make it still, too.

1:14:23.247 --> 1:14:27.217
No, we can't make it. It's over.

1:14:28.619 --> 1:14:31.655
Yeah, we can't, Snake.

1:14:31.689 --> 1:14:34.658
I... I'm gonna make it.

1:14:34.692 --> 1:14:37.061
And the Princess
is going with me.

1:14:37.094 --> 1:14:42.032
Look, man, we're lucky Davis
is still alive.

1:14:42.066 --> 1:14:45.269
Without that bitch,
I got no power left.

1:14:45.302 --> 1:14:48.972
Well, I guess
you're fucked then, ain't you?

1:14:49.006 --> 1:14:51.275
You know what, I'm in charge.

1:14:53.177 --> 1:14:56.347
You and McMasters
can leave whenever you want.

1:14:57.214 --> 1:14:58.682
Bitch is mine.

1:15:33.083 --> 1:15:36.887
Snake, did you
work things out with Raj?

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:38.989
Yeah, we talked.

1:15:39.022 --> 1:15:41.425
<i>And the answer's
go fuck yourself.</i>

1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:46.130
Snake and McMasters
can leave whenever they want.

1:15:46.163 --> 1:15:49.366
The bitch and I want
a helicopter on out of here.

1:15:54.671 --> 1:15:58.609
Raj, I can't get you
a helicopter.

1:16:00.244 --> 1:16:02.546
<i>Only the governor
can approve that.</i>

1:16:03.947 --> 1:16:07.151
All right, have it your way.

1:16:07.184 --> 1:16:09.653
<i>You know,
I've been wanting to die.</i>

1:16:09.686 --> 1:16:11.388
<i>Maybe tonight's the night.</i>

1:16:11.422 --> 1:16:15.592
But the bitch goes with me
and that's on your ass.

1:16:27.304 --> 1:16:29.006
Oh, God.

1:16:32.142 --> 1:16:34.578
So what exactly did he say?

1:16:36.814 --> 1:16:40.484
He said he can't
authorize a chopper.

1:16:40.517 --> 1:16:43.454
So you say you're gonna
kill yourself and the bitch.

1:16:43.487 --> 1:16:47.825
Yeah, and I mean to do it.

1:16:47.859 --> 1:16:49.326
So I'm fucked?

1:16:49.359 --> 1:16:51.094
I need the bitch
for my transfer.

1:16:51.128 --> 1:16:53.664
Well, that's not my
fucking problem now, is it?

1:16:53.697 --> 1:16:55.199
Why do you wanna kill me?

1:16:55.232 --> 1:16:56.967
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.736
I have a daughter. She needs me.

1:16:59.770 --> 1:17:01.572
Do you have a fucking heart?

1:17:01.605 --> 1:17:04.107
I don't want to die.

1:17:04.141 --> 1:17:07.912
If I have to pay,
they have to pay.

1:17:07.946 --> 1:17:11.648
And you have to pay.
That's just how it works.

1:17:11.682 --> 1:17:13.584
Okay, then.

1:17:13.617 --> 1:17:17.421
Then may I talk to my daughter
for the one last time?

1:17:18.655 --> 1:17:22.861
Snake, can I speak to
my daughter one last time?

1:17:22.894 --> 1:17:25.496
- I don't see why not.
- Thank you.

1:17:28.499 --> 1:17:31.502
You can play up
those tears all you want,

1:17:31.535 --> 1:17:33.237
but I know the truth.

1:17:33.837 --> 1:17:34.939
What truth?

1:17:34.973 --> 1:17:36.707
The truth about you and Snake.

1:17:37.808 --> 1:17:39.042
What about us?

1:17:39.076 --> 1:17:41.745
You're crazy, there's nothing...
Fucking truth.

1:17:41.778 --> 1:17:43.347
There's no fucking truth
between us.

1:17:43.380 --> 1:17:45.182
I'm just trying to stay alive.

1:17:45.215 --> 1:17:47.384
I'll do anything
to achieve that.

1:17:47.417 --> 1:17:49.753
Do you understand, motherfucker?

1:17:49.786 --> 1:17:50.955
- Shut up!
- Okay.

1:17:50.989 --> 1:17:53.156
Another truth, Raj.

1:17:53.190 --> 1:17:57.394
The truth about your sorry ass.

1:18:01.098 --> 1:18:02.799
You want to talk about that?

1:18:02.833 --> 1:18:04.201
You want to talk about that?

1:18:04.234 --> 1:18:07.371
Shut up, bitch,
or I'll kill you right now.

1:18:07.404 --> 1:18:10.073
Go ahead, kill me,
I'm already dead.

1:18:10.107 --> 1:18:15.178
But before that, let's discuss
the truth about you,

1:18:15.212 --> 1:18:17.949
how you murdered a woman
because you can't get up for one.

1:18:17.982 --> 1:18:24.154
A prison turned her into a
fucking asshole for old real men.

1:18:24.187 --> 1:18:26.623
You lying whore.

1:18:26.657 --> 1:18:29.359
You're never gonna see
your daughter again.

1:18:29.393 --> 1:18:31.662
- We'll see about that.
- Shut up.

1:18:31.695 --> 1:18:34.665
I need to call Kinkaid
and make a deal for myself.

1:18:34.698 --> 1:18:37.834
You're on your own
and stay the fuck away from me.

1:18:48.612 --> 1:18:50.847
Hello, Snake?

1:18:50.882 --> 1:18:53.216
<i>I wanna talk to Kinkaid.</i>

1:18:53.250 --> 1:18:55.152
Kinkaid's not here.

1:18:55.185 --> 1:18:57.187
He's trying to find a way
to help out your friend.

1:18:57.220 --> 1:18:59.323
Fuck him. He's not my friend,

1:18:59.356 --> 1:19:01.025
I just want my fucking deal.

1:19:01.059 --> 1:19:03.895
Okay, I promise. I'll tell them.

1:19:03.928 --> 1:19:07.364
It may take a bit because he's
talking to the powers that be, okay?

1:19:07.397 --> 1:19:11.002
Look, if we leave now
is my deal still intact?

1:19:11.035 --> 1:19:13.537
Snake, it's Kinkaid.

1:19:13.570 --> 1:19:18.042
Snake, your deal is in place
but I need your help.

1:19:18.076 --> 1:19:20.878
You can't let Cherry
go with Raj.

1:19:20.912 --> 1:19:22.813
You got my word.

1:19:22.846 --> 1:19:26.617
Okay, and you've got mine.

1:19:28.719 --> 1:19:32.255
So that's your plan?
Trusting a guy named Snake?

1:19:45.802 --> 1:19:47.738
The fuck you looking at?

1:19:49.706 --> 1:19:51.241
What did you say?

1:19:55.212 --> 1:19:57.115
I said you're a bitch.

1:19:58.649 --> 1:19:59.783
Oh, that hurt.

1:19:59.816 --> 1:20:02.686
- Say something else.
- That's all you got?

1:20:13.630 --> 1:20:17.035
The girl was right,
you're dickless.

1:20:31.949 --> 1:20:33.483
Shit.

1:20:43.961 --> 1:20:45.729
See you in hell.

1:21:01.745 --> 1:21:03.346
Get on this desk.

1:21:03.380 --> 1:21:05.983
Listen to me, listen to me.

1:21:06.017 --> 1:21:08.752
What do you want?
What do you want?

1:21:10.387 --> 1:21:12.756
I'm not gonna hurt you. Relax.

1:21:29.806 --> 1:21:30.908
Okay.

1:21:32.309 --> 1:21:33.945
What's wrong?

1:21:34.711 --> 1:21:36.513
You fucked me good.

1:21:38.082 --> 1:21:41.185
I need you
to fuck me one more time

1:21:41.219 --> 1:21:43.653
and then kill me, okay?

1:21:43.687 --> 1:21:44.856
You kill me.

1:21:56.934 --> 1:21:59.536
Don't do that,
don't do that, don't do that.

1:22:02.839 --> 1:22:05.709
Stop, stop. Stop.

1:22:07.544 --> 1:22:09.679
You said I fuck good,

1:22:09.713 --> 1:22:16.888
but I'm gonna show you
I fuck even better with a gun.

1:22:34.005 --> 1:22:35.039
Snake!

1:22:36.274 --> 1:22:38.341
The hell's going on here, man?

1:22:42.312 --> 1:22:44.481
I think he
just killed the bitch.

1:23:05.402 --> 1:23:07.404
Get down on your knees.

1:23:08.705 --> 1:23:10.875
I said get down on your knees!

1:23:20.985 --> 1:23:23.888
Worthless piece of shit!

1:23:23.921 --> 1:23:25.056
Think you're in control?

1:23:26.123 --> 1:23:28.491
This is for my daughter.

1:23:42.206 --> 1:23:44.474
So you're gonna
kill me too, bitch?

1:23:49.846 --> 1:23:53.918
Now it is my turn,

1:23:53.951 --> 1:23:55.685
fucking asshole.

1:23:57.088 --> 1:23:59.156
Well, my, my, my.

1:24:24.447 --> 1:24:26.017
Who are you?

1:24:26.050 --> 1:24:27.550
Cherry.

1:24:29.186 --> 1:24:32.555
It's Kinkaid, FBI.

1:24:32.589 --> 1:24:34.724
We spoke, remember?

1:24:35.860 --> 1:24:38.628
Yes. Yes.

1:24:41.165 --> 1:24:42.465
Clear.

1:24:46.070 --> 1:24:47.637
What a mess.

1:24:56.513 --> 1:24:59.716
Here we go, here we go.
Here we go.

1:25:00.850 --> 1:25:03.421
You're okay now. You're safe.

1:25:13.763 --> 1:25:16.934
It's over, okay. It's over.
