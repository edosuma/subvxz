You think Amber ran away?

00:20.587 --> 00:26.360
No way. She had too much going
on to just take off like that.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.529
Need help?
Oh, No. You're off the clock.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.398

I'll take care of you tonight.

you do what you gotta do.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.893
And I love Isela
more than anything.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.363

have waited to have kids.

to scratch someone's eyes out.

09:07.938 --> 09:11.008
We're here to talk about
the experiences

09:11.075 --> 09:13.411
that Ceci had as a teen mom.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.146
Ceci,
was the baby planned?

09:15.212 --> 09:17.982
Aw, hell no.
We didn't plan nothin'.

09:18.049 --> 09:19.684
I wasn't on birth control
and my boyfriend

09:19.750 --> 09:21.686
didn't like wearing no condoms.

09:21.752 --> 09:24.989
So after I got pregnant,
I dropped out of school.

09:25.056 --> 09:26.791
And then I got kicked out
of my house,

09:26.857 --> 09:28.959
and wound up living
in a shelter.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.761
Must have been an upgrade.

09:30.828 --> 09:33.664
Actually, it was. Have you ever
lived out on the streets?

09:33.731 --> 09:38.069
Take it from me, just one
hook-up without protection

09:38.135 --> 09:40.638
can change
the rest of your life.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.040
CECI:
Yes?

09:43.107 --> 09:45.009
So, what's your
baby daddy doing?

09:45.076 --> 09:49.280
Three years for selling weed.
Any more questions?

09:49.347 --> 09:50.848
GIRL:
So who takes care of your baby?

09:50.915 --> 09:52.383
What did I miss?

09:52.650 --> 09:54.385
She screwed a dope dealer,
got knocked-up,

09:54.652 --> 09:55.953
and now she's our role model.

09:56.020 --> 09:57.388
You're up to speed.

09:57.655 --> 10:00.257

CAMILIA: Glad that's over.

10:00.324 --> 10:02.026
You know you're insulting me,
right?

10:02.093 --> 10:05.663
These classes are part of my
campaign to improve Sex Ed here.

10:05.730 --> 10:09.033
Ha-ha. I'm kidding.
I love that you care.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.002
I do. And so should you.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.805
You know, it's important
to talk about this stuff.

10:14.872 --> 10:18.809
Yeah. You're right.
Come on, let's go.

10:18.876 --> 10:20.678

10:23.414 --> 10:25.416
Hey. You doing anything
after school?

10:25.683 --> 10:30.054
Uh, yeah, I got Bomb Squad
rehearsal, a yearbook meeting,

10:30.121 --> 10:33.023
and about three hours
of homework.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.859
But I always
got time for you.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.328

about. It's kind of serious.

10:39.330 --> 10:40.998
We'll talk after school.

10:41.065 --> 10:42.666

on the history test?

10:42.733 --> 10:44.068
We had a history test?

10:44.135 --> 10:47.204
Girl, it's senior year.
Get it together.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.106
Too late. I ain't
going to college.

10:49.173 --> 10:51.308
I got no money, no grades.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.210
You know, you're smarter
than you think.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.413

11:01.685 --> 11:04.955
Go find Amber or something.
I'm working on it.

11:05.022 --> 11:06.824

this afternoon?

11:06.891 --> 11:09.660
I don't know, I'm too lazy.

11:09.727 --> 11:11.328
Of course I'll be there.

11:11.395 --> 11:14.198

11:14.265 --> 11:15.699
Still taken.

That's right, papi.
Play hard to get.

11:18.068 --> 11:21.172
Primo.
Tight. Get to class.

11:23.674 --> 11:27.077
( imitating intercom ):
Ceci Camayo, please report
to the principal's office.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.213
Stupid. What are you doing here?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.315
I'm the new assistant coach.
What are you doing here?

11:31.382 --> 11:33.117
Trying to jack
these trophies, huh?

11:33.184 --> 11:35.052
I earned them. I should.

11:35.119 --> 11:38.022
Look at this, it's like
a class reunion.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.357
Almost.
Except only one of us graduated.

11:40.424 --> 11:42.226
Hey, I got my G.E.D.

11:42.293 --> 11:45.930
JACOB:
All right, I gotta go.
See ya.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.933
The last time the squad had a
winning season I was co-captain.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.634
Oh, don't remind me.

11:50.701 --> 11:53.838
I think I'm
gonna have to hire them a coach.

11:53.904 --> 11:56.674
Good luck. Because they need
a bitch wrangler.

11:56.740 --> 12:00.177
( bell rings )
Oh, shit. I gotta go to work.

12:02.279 --> 12:04.882
( dramatic theme playing )

12:07.852 --> 12:10.187
CECI:
 Hi, Mrs. Blake, I know how much
you hate me being late.

12:10.254 --> 12:12.156
Anyways, I promise you
it will never happen again.

12:12.223 --> 12:14.758
Thank you. I owe you big time.

12:22.733 --> 12:24.401
Mrs. Blake, I'm so sorry
I'm late--

12:24.668 --> 12:26.770
Who the hell are you?

12:26.837 --> 12:29.273
New nanny. You late.

12:29.340 --> 12:32.743
You've been replaced.
Give me your keys.

12:32.810 --> 12:35.279
No. No.
Give me your--

12:35.346 --> 12:37.081
What the hell?
( speaking in Russian )

12:37.147 --> 12:40.885
No, no. I need this job.
No. Wait.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.625
CECI:
Can you believe it?

12:47.691 --> 12:50.361
That English lady
slammed the door in my face.

12:50.628 --> 12:53.264
Dang! I really needed that job.
It was perfect.

12:53.330 --> 12:55.099
What do you mean "perfect"?

12:55.165 --> 12:57.401
You were always complaining
about busing to the West Side,

12:57.668 --> 12:59.870
and being all far away
from Isela.

12:59.937 --> 13:03.140
Yeah, I know, but it was better
than having no job.

13:03.207 --> 13:04.942
What am I supposed to do now?

13:05.009 --> 13:07.811
Find a job you love.

13:07.878 --> 13:11.682
I love cooking.
What do you love?

13:11.749 --> 13:14.151
CECI:
You know who brought home those
trophies two years in a row?

13:14.218 --> 13:17.021
Right here. That's what you get
if you hire me.

13:17.087 --> 13:20.391
I would love to hire you, Ceci,
but I need a real coach.

13:20.624 --> 13:21.992
You have no experience.

13:22.059 --> 13:23.761
What do you mean
"no experience"?

13:23.827 --> 13:25.829
When I was captain,
we didn't need no coach,

13:25.896 --> 13:28.299
that's how good I am.
If you hire me,

13:28.365 --> 13:30.868
I will pack this place
so full of trophies

13:30.935 --> 13:33.404
you'll have to build
the Ceci Camayo Hall of Fame.

13:33.671 --> 13:35.272
Those girls are tough.

13:35.339 --> 13:37.207
I mean, do you really think
you can handle them?

13:37.274 --> 13:40.110
Please, you saw how I handled
them in that Life Skills class.

13:40.177 --> 13:41.845
Let me think about it.

13:41.912 --> 13:44.281
Did I show you
my East Los shuffle?

13:44.348 --> 13:46.884
( snapping fingers )

13:48.152 --> 13:50.721
Come on, Miss A,

13:50.788 --> 13:53.290
you know you want to hire me.

13:54.391 --> 13:56.327
Oh, my God.

13:56.393 --> 13:59.096
Miss Baby Barf, Ceci,
wants to be our new coach.

13:59.163 --> 14:01.799
We don't need a coach.
Just a new dance captain.

14:01.865 --> 14:03.233
I'm not saying
it should be me,

14:03.300 --> 14:04.902
but I was captain
at Yuma High.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.203
Hey, Gina, you ready?
Hey.

14:06.270 --> 14:08.138
Where are you guys going?

14:08.205 --> 14:11.675
Um, I'll call you later. Let's
go get our nails done on Sunday.

14:11.742 --> 14:13.877
Why do you keep hanging out
with that new girl?

14:13.944 --> 14:15.245
TIFFANY:
Call me!

14:15.312 --> 14:17.848
She acts like she's
better than everyone.

14:17.915 --> 14:20.751
Tiffany's okay
once you get to know her.

14:25.689 --> 14:27.024
REPORTER:
And what's your full name?

14:27.091 --> 14:29.860
Jocelyn Reyes.
Thank you.

14:32.363 --> 14:34.865
I just found out a network
is covering the rally.

14:34.932 --> 14:36.867
I'm gonna be on TV.

14:36.934 --> 14:39.036
What?

14:39.103 --> 14:40.938
Wait, not looking like
that you ain't.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.874
Cut it out. I'm gonna be on the
local news not the red carpet.

14:43.941 --> 14:46.910
Mija, if you don't look hot,
no one is gonna listen to you.

14:46.977 --> 14:48.746
( sighs )
I got you.

14:48.812 --> 14:52.116
All right, pucker up.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.018
I'm really nervous.

14:54.084 --> 14:56.687
You're gonna kick ass.

14:56.754 --> 14:59.356
GINA:
You're joining the Army?

14:59.423 --> 15:01.792
What about our plans? We were
gonna go to college together.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.093
My folks can't afford it.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.095
This way at least
the Army will pay for it.

15:05.162 --> 15:07.665
I can't pay
for college either.

15:07.731 --> 15:09.366
Just apply for scholarships like
me.

15:09.633 --> 15:12.236
You know
I ain't got the grades.

15:12.302 --> 15:17.708
Okay, well, go to community
college or get financial aid.

15:17.775 --> 15:19.943
And what if they send you
to Afghanistan? You could die.

15:20.010 --> 15:22.379
Ha. Come on. I'm from East Los.

15:22.646 --> 15:25.649
Do you know how many
drive-by's I've dodged?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.951
None.
Okay.

15:28.018 --> 15:31.855
Well, you know how many hours
of "Call of Duty" I've played?

15:31.922 --> 15:34.024
I can't believe
you're leaving me.

15:34.091 --> 15:37.127
Gina, I'm doing this
for our future.

15:37.194 --> 15:39.630
You're gonna wait for me,
right?

15:39.697 --> 15:42.766
Of course. You're my man.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.903
And you're my lady, por vida.

15:53.977 --> 15:56.980
CROWD ( chanting ):
Amber! Amber!

15:57.047 --> 16:01.051
Wow. So what an amazing crowd
has gathered here today.

16:01.118 --> 16:05.122
What prompted you exactly to
organize this rally for Amber?

16:05.189 --> 16:07.725
The police aren't doing enough
to find her.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.660
If Amber was some West Side
white girl,

16:09.727 --> 16:12.229
the entire LAPD
would be mobilized.

16:12.296 --> 16:15.833
Every-- Every major news channel
would be reporting it 24/7.

16:15.899 --> 16:17.901
MAN:
That's right.

16:17.968 --> 16:21.638
B-But when a Latina
or a black girl goes missing,

16:21.705 --> 16:23.273
nobody gives a damn.

16:23.340 --> 16:26.110
( crowd cheers )

16:26.176 --> 16:29.680
We can't stop looking for Amber.
We know she's still out there.

16:29.747 --> 16:31.381
( dramatic theme playing )

16:31.648 --> 16:33.984
( crying )
No. No.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.755
Stop it.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.369
PEDRO:
Babe, don't worry
about not having a job.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.304
I got this. It's fine.

16:54.371 --> 16:57.074
ISELA: Mama.
How we gonna pay the bills?

16:57.141 --> 16:59.109
I'm up for
a really big promotion.

16:59.176 --> 17:01.979
I mean, wouldn't you like more
time with Isela? Look at her.

17:02.045 --> 17:04.014
Pedro, you know we need
the money.

17:04.081 --> 17:05.716
Besides, I like to work.

17:05.783 --> 17:07.151
Just let me take care of you.

17:07.217 --> 17:08.886
All you have to worry about

17:08.952 --> 17:11.288
is being Isela's mom
and my woman. That's it.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.827
It might be nice to stay home.
It would.

17:16.894 --> 17:19.296
( phone buzzing )
Thank you. Oh.

17:19.363 --> 17:21.665
( Pedro speaks indistinctly )

17:22.800 --> 17:25.769
CECI: Hello.
ISELA: Mama.

17:25.836 --> 17:29.273
Yes, yes! That's awesome,
Miss Alvarez. Thank you.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.941
Okay, bye.

17:31.008 --> 17:35.078
New dance coach in the house.
I got the job at East Los.

17:35.145 --> 17:38.649
What about staying home?
What am I gonna wear?

17:38.715 --> 17:39.983
Want a high five?

17:40.050 --> 17:42.085
Give me five.
Ugh!

17:42.152 --> 17:44.421
CAMILIA:
You were so beautiful on TV.

17:44.688 --> 17:49.226
Strong, smart, articulate.

17:49.293 --> 17:50.828
( both laughing )

17:50.894 --> 17:54.198
Oh, God. "Articulate?"

17:54.264 --> 17:57.000
Yeah, that's gotta
be the herb talking.

17:59.837 --> 18:03.907
It's like, how are we
even best friends?

18:03.974 --> 18:05.642
You're gonna be somebody.

18:05.709 --> 18:09.279
Eh. Wherever I go, you go.

18:09.346 --> 18:11.415
What? As your maid?

18:11.682 --> 18:14.151
Ha. No way.
( chuckles )

18:14.218 --> 18:15.686
I've seen your room.

18:15.752 --> 18:17.855
Hey! That's art.

18:17.921 --> 18:20.757
( both laugh )

18:23.093 --> 18:27.164
Oh, man.
This shit's fading me.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.800
Can I stay here?

18:29.867 --> 18:33.070
Uh, yeah. Sure.

18:37.674 --> 18:39.343
( sighs )

18:50.087 --> 18:51.688
What?

18:54.324 --> 18:56.026
Nothing.

18:57.394 --> 19:02.065
Uh, I'm gonna go
get you a T-shirt.

19:07.404 --> 19:09.673
You don't have to walk me
all the way to my door.

19:09.740 --> 19:12.309
Yes, I do.
With Amber missing?

19:12.376 --> 19:16.179
I'm not gonna let nothing
happen to my sweet G.

19:16.246 --> 19:18.015
I'm just gonna miss you
so much.

19:18.081 --> 19:20.751
Hey, come on.

19:20.817 --> 19:22.419
I'm not leaving
till the end of the year.

19:22.686 --> 19:25.355
I'm still going to have
plenty of time for you.

19:25.422 --> 19:27.724
( dramatic theme playing )

19:43.307 --> 19:44.942
You okay?

19:45.008 --> 19:49.112
Uh, I think it's stuck.

19:51.348 --> 19:54.284
Help me.

20:17.874 --> 20:20.177
Do you want a T-shirt?

20:29.720 --> 20:32.656
( sighs )

20:54.945 --> 20:57.047
Y esa cara?

20:57.114 --> 20:59.850
Diego's joining the Army.
What if he gets killed?

20:59.916 --> 21:01.985
( speaking in Spanish )

21:02.052 --> 21:04.121
All you have to do is make
sure you guys get married.

21:04.187 --> 21:06.089
That way if anything happens,
you're set for life.

21:06.156 --> 21:08.625
Mom, don't say that.

21:08.692 --> 21:11.661
It was a joke.
Nothing's going to happen.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.196
Diego's a great guy.

21:13.263 --> 21:14.931
( in Spanish ):
Not like your loser father.

21:14.998 --> 21:17.267
I really love him, mami.
How can you?

21:17.334 --> 21:20.237
( in Spanish ):
That son of a bitch left us
homeless--

21:20.303 --> 21:23.106
Not Dad. Diego.

21:23.173 --> 21:27.411
Oh, that's great, mija.
 Diego's a solid guy.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.413
He is so in love with you.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.949
( moaning )

21:33.016 --> 21:34.918
( sighing )

21:36.920 --> 21:39.790
God, you drive me crazy.

21:39.856 --> 21:42.726
I'm just
getting started.

21:42.793 --> 21:44.227
( upbeat theme playing )

21:44.294 --> 21:46.396
( gasps )
