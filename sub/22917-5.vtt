I need someone
who can play the flower pots.

Hai Lai, you know, when I first
came to the orchestra,

00:48.215 --> 00:50.551
I wanted to fire, like,
25% of all the musicians.

00:50.593 --> 00:53.095
But then, I-I couldn't, because
I fell in love with them.

Yeah, but we live with him.

I already need
to find a new flautist

for the Lacrimosa,

01:29.048 --> 01:32.051
I was thinking of bringing
the timpani to the front,

01:32.092 --> 01:34.220

I was watching the news,

"fraud" and "scrutiny"

03:36.717 --> 03:39.136
-Oh.
-I call it "Asyla,"

03:39.178 --> 03:40.471

Yeah, she needs a fresh start

03:57.571 --> 03:59.698

killed the Pope.

-please, darling...
-Hmm? Oh.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.246

-EGON: We'll try something else.

No, no, no. No, I don't want
to try something.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.644
I'm-I'm done, Egon.

10:02.686 --> 10:03.937

-You're done?
-Yes.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.734
-What do you mean? -I don't want
to do this anymore.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.360
Okay, so you're not up
for the work.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.070
I'm always up for the work.
That's the problem.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.822
Everyone, a little round
of applause.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.658
Thank you. Thank you so much
for your precious time.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.076
I really appreciate it.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.536
Everyone, let's watch
how he exits.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.912
I think I left my fucking keys.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.205
-Where are they?
-We can use this.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.707

10:53.612 --> 10:55.489
-bars two and three? -Yeah,
I was wondering what that was.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.199
Try playing that
like a scratchy stop.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.700
-"Scratchy stop"?
-Yes.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.702
Think of it as like
a punctuated hit

11:00.744 --> 11:02.287
that launches us
into the next piece.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.288
Try it, please.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.124
(violin screeches harshly)

11:06.166 --> 11:10.045
Um, what I'm looking for
more of is like a...

11:10.087 --> 11:11.546
sudden angled pop.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.964
I'm not sure...

11:13.006 --> 11:15.050
Okay. Um...

11:15.092 --> 11:17.844
Warren, you know the feeling
when you're standing

11:17.886 --> 11:20.222
on top of, like,
a very tall building

11:20.263 --> 11:22.015
and you kind of want to jump,
but then you don't,

11:22.057 --> 11:23.600
but it's just the idea
that's kind of thrilling?

11:23.642 --> 11:25.685
Or like when you're on
a really high-speed train...

11:25.727 --> 11:27.020
...and it takes a sudden turn,

11:27.062 --> 11:28.480
and then your stomach
goes into your ears.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.357
And so I was just talking
and I couldn't stop myself

11:30.399 --> 11:31.650
from talking,
even though I was kind of

11:31.691 --> 11:33.235

watching myself talk.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.986

sitting there, looking at me

we used to say,

19:56.154 --> 19:59.240
if we are truly collaborative,
we will experience...

19:59.282 --> 20:00.575
ALL:
...unity!

20:00.617 --> 20:03.077
-We were on LSD!
-But we meant it.

20:03.119 --> 20:07.040
And don't you still
believe those things?

20:07.081 --> 20:10.793
I mean, it wasn't until I got
back together with Thomas again

20:10.835 --> 20:14.422
that I truly felt set on fire!

20:14.464 --> 20:16.049
Literally.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.051
She's commissioned the piece.
It's hers.

20:18.092 --> 20:21.346
Come on, let's fuck things up
and let's just go have

20:21.387 --> 20:23.681
some goddamn fun!
What do you say?!

20:23.723 --> 20:26.351
-Come on, let's do it.
-WINSLOW: Exactly.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.186
MAN:
Gloria, I want you.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.562
I need you.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.814
I shouldn't even be here.
(chuckles)

20:31.856 --> 20:34.067
-Have you enjoyed my gifts?
-I have.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.652
But you're wasting your money.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.987
I'm already taken.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.948
The Guggenheim Museum wants you

20:39.989 --> 20:42.367
to be our next
executive director.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.536
Hilla von Rebay
envisioned this place

20:45.578 --> 20:47.705
as a temple to the spirit.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.501
Come, shepherd that spirit
into a new age.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.127
Come join the big leagues.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.964
The New York Symphony
is the big leagues.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.632
Yes, but our donors are not

20:57.674 --> 21:00.635
just the crème de la crème
of New York.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.762
They come from
all over the world.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.807
(sighs):
Oh.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.101
-That is tempting.
-And the best part:

21:08.142 --> 21:12.021
unlike your moody musicians
or conductors...

21:12.063 --> 21:15.191
the art doesn't talk back
and won't go on strike.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.485
Any rats at the Guggenheim?
(laughs)

21:17.527 --> 21:19.487
No rats, Gloria.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.073
Just look me in the eye
right now and tell me

21:22.115 --> 21:24.909
that you're 100% satisfied
with the symphony,

21:24.951 --> 21:28.079
that you want to stay
and that I should drop it.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.123
And I will.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.962
Let's have some more wine.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.297
-Is that him?
-(instruments warming up)

21:38.339 --> 21:39.882
Mm, no. Which one?

21:39.924 --> 21:41.217
-The guy with the mustache?
-Oh, no.

21:41.259 --> 21:42.218
That's Antonio
from the nude circus.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.553
No, the guy behind him.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.431
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not him. No.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.932
I'm so glad that you're here.
Is everything okay?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.475
-Yeah, I was just
under the weather. -Okay.

21:49.517 --> 21:50.810
I wasn't gonna miss this
for anything.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.979
Thank you so much.
Okay, um, get settled in.

21:53.021 --> 21:55.064
Sasha is gonna fill you in
on the few changes,

21:55.106 --> 21:57.275
-and, uh, I'll see you soon.
-Okay. Enjoy.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.736
-RODRIGO (whispering):
Holy shit! Holy shit! -What?

21:59.777 --> 22:01.529
Puta madre.
Hai Lai, they called in

22:01.571 --> 22:03.239
Arnar Valgirsson
to be the scout.

22:03.281 --> 22:05.491
-HAILEY: Who is that? -He's a
top critic of music in Iceland.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.909
They call him
the Stinking Shark of Reykjavík.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.453
He once gave me
a really bad review.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.371
A horrendous review.
Don't worry about him.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.290
Don't worry, don't worry.
He said that I was a...

22:12.331 --> 22:14.292
a tropical bird with no wings.
How fucked up is that?

22:14.333 --> 22:15.626
-That's really fucked up.
-No?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.045
Hey, Hai Lai, I was thinking--

22:17.086 --> 22:19.088
you know the last
ten bars of the piece?

22:19.130 --> 22:20.757
You could do without them,
don't you think?

22:20.798 --> 22:21.966
You can just cut them.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.634
You know, I don't think
the music needs them.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.720
I think Caroline Shaw
meant for them to be there,

22:25.762 --> 22:27.305
so I'm gonna keep them.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.307
Okay, okay.
Well, okay, but, you know,

22:29.348 --> 22:31.559
it's not about Caroline Shaw
right now, it's about you.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.227
It's about you and the music,
about the freedom.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.353
-There's no donors,
there's nothing. -Yes.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.480
Just really try things,
you know?

22:35.521 --> 22:36.731
Just do what's good
for the music.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.024
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.359
Okay, great.
And the viola section--

22:40.401 --> 22:42.070
-did you find someone?
-I'm gonna try something new.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.321
-Don't worry about it.
-Ah, a surprise.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.948
-Okay, surprise. Okay.
-Okay.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.284
Mierda, Hai Lai,
mierda, mierda!

22:52.705 --> 22:55.124
(whispers):
Why is my dad here?

22:55.166 --> 22:57.085
I told him to come.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.377
Are you out of
your fucking mind?!

22:58.419 --> 23:00.296
-Why would you do that?
-Because I think it's something

23:00.338 --> 23:03.382
that you have to go through, Hai
Lai. You have to confront him.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.967
I need you to tell him to leave.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.636
Otherwise I'm not
gonna be able to do this.

23:06.677 --> 23:07.887
Okay, I can tell him to leave.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.514
-Okay.
-Or, or...

23:09.555 --> 23:11.474
you can go onstage
and kill yourself.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.976
-What?! -Yes, yes.
Do a sacrifice, Hai Lai.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.062
Yes. Grab that little girl
that thinks stuff like

23:16.104 --> 23:18.523
"you're the best or you fucking
suck"-- you know, those voices

23:18.564 --> 23:19.982
that your father has
in your head--

23:20.024 --> 23:21.442
and just throw them
out of the window.

23:21.484 --> 23:22.819
Throw them,
like they're a boomerang.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.112
Boomerangs come back, though.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.364
But... but it depends
how you throw them.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.783
Okay, you can't
run and make music

23:28.825 --> 23:30.952
at the same time, you know;
you have to take a breath.

23:30.993 --> 23:34.539
You have to confront this.
All right?

23:34.580 --> 23:37.083
I swear, because afterwards
the whole Japan thing,

23:37.125 --> 23:39.085
really, is just
gonna be like a quark.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.294
A quark?

23:40.336 --> 23:42.255
Just a little thing of an atom.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.342
(instruments warming up)

23:48.427 --> 23:49.720
You can't watch.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.347
Eso.

23:51.389 --> 23:53.391
(instruments stop)

23:54.433 --> 23:56.435
(applause)

23:58.479 --> 23:59.897
HAILEY:
Good evening.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.440
We're the Hailey Rutledge
Ensemble.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.109
Tonight we have the privilege

24:03.151 --> 24:05.987
of debuting a new piece
by Caroline Shaw.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.489
I also have my father here,
from North Carolina.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.367
And I wouldn't be here
without him.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.411
So, thanks for coming.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.506
