WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:03.878
Mr. Benedict and Number Two are missing.

00:03.962 --> 00:06.256
KATE: "Take the shortcut".

00:06.339 --> 00:07.590
REYNIE: <i>What's the shortcut?</i>

00:07.674 --> 00:09.300
STICKY:
<i>It's the fastest ship in the world.</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:11.761
I demand our immediate release.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.513
Release? From what?

00:13.596 --> 00:15.807
JACKSON: Our community
has been thoughtfully curated.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.475
Positivity is an absolute requirement.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.310
-Hello, friends.
-JACKSON: Hello, Sebastian.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.938
He's one of the earliest adopters
of Dr. Curtain's philosophy.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.025
CAPTAIN NOLAND: <i>Prepare to dock in Lisbon
in a spectacular 48 hours.</i>

00:25.108 --> 00:26.860
We need to lay low. Blend in.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.571
Wish we had matching tracksuits
like the cricket squad over there.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.489
REYNIE: Their warm-ups say,
"water polo, actually."

00:31.573 --> 00:32.824
CANNONBALL: <i>Based on my life jacket count,</i>

00:32.907 --> 00:35.368
there are four extra passengers
on board the <i>Shortcut</i>.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.579
We need to find those stowaways.

00:37.662 --> 00:38.496
RHONDA: <i>This is good.</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:42.083
We're scheduled to arrive in Lisbon
a good 25 hours before the kids.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.794
You're creating
an artificial state of happiness.

00:44.878 --> 00:45.920
People seem to enjoy it.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.716
BENEDICT: <i>It is a complete disconnection
from true emotion.</i>

00:49.799 --> 00:51.718
REYNIE: Mr. Benedict thought
we'd be in that stateroom.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.053
So the clue has to be there.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.055
I bet we use that key
at the train station.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.777
(suspenseful music)

01:08.860 --> 01:11.029
Good evening, children.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.035
There.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.081
(ominous music)

01:25.585 --> 01:30.548
They are on this boat.
Find them before we reach land.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.055
(theme music)

02:32.861 --> 02:35.613
STICKY: We were hanging
120 feet above the ocean.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.949
Our hands could've slipped,
the rope could've snapped.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.160
Do you know what the survival rates are
for a fall like that?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.828
Not high. Not high at all.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.705
It's okay. We made it down.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.331
I'm kicking myself, guys.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.334
I should have known
they weren't real water polo players.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.961
Trailing. Come on.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.672
They must be undercover.
Working for Curtain.

02:52.755 --> 02:56.176
-Curtain? Why? What does he want with us?
-Think about it.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.179
He has everyone in the world
believing he solved the Emergency.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.890
But we know the truth. We know he's lying.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.017
Like Mr. Benedict and Number Two.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.436
So he kidnapped them,
and now he's coming after us.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.397
Solid move. I'd kidnap us, too.

03:10.064 --> 03:14.152
All his talk about happiness,
that book of his, all a ruse.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.361
A trick.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.488
We need to just stick with the plan.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.532
Follow the clues Mr. Benedict left for us

03:19.616 --> 03:22.327
until we get close enough
to find him and Number Two.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.329
And then we take care of Curtain.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.583
-Somehow.
-Confidence-inspiring.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.213
For now, we lie low and stay down here
until we get to Lisbon.

03:33.296 --> 03:37.342
-Where do we sleep?
-How about over there?

03:37.425 --> 03:39.093
REYNIE: No one will be able to see us.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.387
On the metal?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.515
Metal is a luxury. Toughen up, George.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.517
Hmm.

03:46.601 --> 03:52.482
Oh, he is inducing happiness
by using a direct synaptic access.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.276
Oh, it's not just disturbing,
it's dangerous.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.861
Oh, it's very disturbing.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.155
-Yet remarkable.
-What?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.115
Someone even called it
a scientific breakthrough.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.159
-Who would call it that?
-Most neuroscientists.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.412
It's manipulation,
a simulation of happiness.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.165
-It's not real.
-The world doesn't see it that way.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.960
Well, that's what makes it
so extraordinarily dangerous.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.713
People are becoming dependent
on this artificial state of mind!

04:16.464 --> 04:19.550
And yet another way
my brother can exert his control.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.013
Number Two, please put the garbage
back in the bin. What is this?

04:24.097 --> 04:27.392
(sighs)
This garbage is our way out of here.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.728
My instincts are taking me
towards tunneling,

04:30.812 --> 04:32.730
-which I figured you'd reject?
-Correct.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.985
Hm. So I thought
we'd try something different. Mold.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.319
-Mold?
-Yes.

04:38.403 --> 04:42.156
We have all the materials
and conditions to grow a mold infestation

04:42.240 --> 04:44.117
in every building in this compound.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.327
-"Infestation?"
-(sighs)

04:46.411 --> 04:48.663
Tactical fungal infection.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.958
Break them down from the inside.
Literally.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.044
I fear that violates
a number of international treaties.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.462
I didn't sign anything.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.674
-It's clever. Troubling, but clever.
-Thank you.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.927
However, I believe
our unfortunate kidnapping

05:03.011 --> 05:05.346
presents a more fortuitous opportunity

05:05.847 --> 05:08.016
to infect my brother with love.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.144
Genuine love. Love for his fellow man.

05:11.227 --> 05:15.023
-What?
-And maybe some real happiness.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.525
-Love for his fellow man?
-Yes.

05:17.608 --> 05:21.988
-He kidnapped us.
-Because he wants me here.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.743
When we were young,
Nathaniel was an ace in algebra.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.204
An ace, but he always wanted me
to check his work,

05:30.288 --> 05:33.416
not because he needed me to,
but to show how brilliant he was.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.877
-So?
-He craves my approval.

05:35.960 --> 05:40.381
If I could just have more time with him
and not be so judgmental,

05:40.465 --> 05:43.926
I really believe I could get him
to listen to me.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.472
-I think you're being naive.
-(sighs deeply)

05:47.555 --> 05:50.808
Do you remember what happened
the last time you two squared off?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.977
-Well, that was on his turf.
-So is this.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.982
You're wasting your time.
I'm going to devise an escape plan.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.110
We need to get out of here
and alert the authorities.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.403
Expose him.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.199
And I would love to find a phone.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.743
Rhonda and Milligan
must be sick with worry.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.162
Yes, a phone.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.082
I will go search for one.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.959
And, um, take heart.

06:17.502 --> 06:21.714
At least Rhonda and Milligan are at home,
away from danger.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.217
(thunder rumbles)

06:26.803 --> 06:28.930
ANNOUNCER:
<i>It seems we've hit stubborn headwinds.</i>

06:29.013 --> 06:31.099
<i>So in addition to the light chop,</i>

06:31.182 --> 06:33.184
<i>there might be a slight delay</i>
<i>to our arrival.</i>

06:33.267 --> 06:34.852
We can't afford a delay.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.397
We need to get to Lisbon
before the children.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.858
ANNOUNCER: <i>We're looking at five to six
additional flight hours.</i>

06:40.942 --> 06:43.569
<i>Eight tops. Definitely under 12.</i>

06:44.445 --> 06:46.739
I'm afraid it's beyond our control.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.408
-MAN 1: Oh, god!
-WOMAN 1: Oh, no!

06:48.491 --> 06:50.118
-MAN 2: Oh, no!
-WOMAN 2: Somebody grab it.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.285
No.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.871
-(waiter pants)
-(thunder rumbles)

06:53.955 --> 06:59.127
You can do this. Professionalism. Say it.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.545
Professionalism.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.296
RHONDA: Yes!

07:02.380 --> 07:05.716
Easy does it. Easy, easy, easy.

07:09.303 --> 07:13.558
The crate of sugar was empty,
and there were tiny handprints inside.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.143
Children's handprints.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.313
So, not just stowaways.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.191
They're responsible for undermining
our culinary excellence.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.861
Their infractions continue to multiply.
With respect...

07:25.319 --> 07:26.612
Why haven't you found them?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.322
Some of them are quite small.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.409
But there are only a few places left
they could be hiding.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.119
I'm confident we'll have them soon.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.622
More urgently...
(sighs)

07:36.706 --> 07:41.043
...the first engineer confirms our speed
is indeed trending slower than usual.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.963
He's doing everything he can
to rectify the situation,

07:44.046 --> 07:47.008
but at this rate,
we'll arrive two hours late.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.719
Three on the outside.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.679
This will shatter our reputation!

07:52.305 --> 07:54.599
Captain, are you all right?

07:55.391 --> 07:59.979
Aside from a slight case
of low blood sugar, my faltering marriage,

08:00.605 --> 08:05.109
and the liens on my house and my vehicle,
I am top drawer.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.698
-Redline the engines!
-MAN: That is remarkably unwise, Captain.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.742
-Do as I say.
-MAN: Yes, Captain.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.622
(indistinct chatter in distance)

08:19.165 --> 08:21.167
(snoring)

08:33.846 --> 08:35.056
Constance?

08:37.683 --> 08:38.935
Where is she going?

08:39.977 --> 08:42.230
(people cheering)

09:00.206 --> 09:02.083
Constance wants a taste.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.752
A taste? I want a full course meal.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.672
No. We came down here
to stay out of sight.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.008
If we go in there and gamble,
we'd be completely exposed.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.053
We're going to need more money
in Lisbon to get to the train station.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.055
The inflation rate in Portugal
is alarming.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.933
Listen to him.
This could solve all our problems.

09:19.016 --> 09:21.811
We could lose all of it,
and then we have nothing.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.898
-No risk, no reward.
-And the risk is infinitesimal.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.985
-It's actually quite large.
-Potayto, potahto.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.903
Let's go get rich.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.993
What? Our money's no good here?

09:37.076 --> 09:42.707
This really isn't a place for kids.
Your parents know you're down here?

09:42.790 --> 09:45.209
They sent me to clean house.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.295
(upbeat music)

09:58.264 --> 09:59.473
Lookin' or playing?

10:02.727 --> 10:04.103
I'm playing.

10:05.855 --> 10:06.981
What's the maximum bet?

10:10.776 --> 10:12.111
I'd like to play some poker.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.447
We'd love you to play some poker.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.628
(all cheer)

10:28.711 --> 10:29.712
WOMAN 1: Winner.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.839
Dealer busts.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.133
WOMAN 2: Blackjack.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.722
Seven again?

10:39.805 --> 10:41.307
-It's just too easy.
-Yeah!

10:48.189 --> 10:50.399
(upbeat music)

10:58.074 --> 10:59.909
-Double it.
-On 17?

11:02.953 --> 11:04.246
Dumb luck.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.668
(upbeat music)

11:14.882 --> 11:15.883
Call.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.313
Invest in some sunglasses, kid.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.569
(all cheer)

11:40.074 --> 11:41.826
Get yourself something nice.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.220
(indistinct chatter)

12:17.945 --> 12:19.155
MAN: We'll set up now.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.448
L.D. CURTAIN: Okay. Good.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.365
Now go.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.869
WOMAN: And 30 seconds. Audience members
can go and take your seats, please.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.705
-Mr. Benedict. We've been expecting you.
-WOMAN: Camera 1, check!

12:27.788 --> 12:29.248
-Right this way.
-WOMAN: Camera 2, check!

12:31.292 --> 12:32.293
Yeah.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.505
WOMAN: Five, four, three.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.178
(applause)

12:46.265 --> 12:47.641
L.D. CURTAIN: Thank you.

12:47.725 --> 12:51.270
Friends, my name is L.D. Curtain.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.191
Many of you know me as the man
who solved The Emergency,

12:55.274 --> 12:57.401
but that's not what I'm here
to talk to you about.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.946
Today, I am so pleased

13:01.030 --> 13:05.826
to share with my growing family
all over the world

13:05.910 --> 13:10.289
about something quite simple
and yet quite profound.

13:10.372 --> 13:14.001
I'd like to talk to you about happiness.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.005
(thunder rumbles)

13:18.088 --> 13:20.925
You've been staring at that same page
for over an hour.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.471
Just making sure that
I'm fully absorbing the material.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.516
It's an advertisement for cough drops.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.976
Nuanced advertisement.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.103
(thunder rumbles)

13:39.401 --> 13:40.569
It's okay to be scared.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.116
I am not scared.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.246
This is a marvel of engineering.

13:50.871 --> 13:54.542
Is a gold bar scared in Fort Knox?

14:01.882 --> 14:06.387
I am worried, though.
Painfully so about them.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.806
It's hard not to be.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.226
To be a parent is to live
in a constant state of worry.

14:12.977 --> 14:17.189
But I'm learning that worrying
is not a form of preparation.

14:17.815 --> 14:21.277
Doesn't make anything less
likely to happen

14:21.360 --> 14:24.280
nor armor you if it does.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.828
We're going to find them.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.374
ANNOUNCER: <i>Good evening.
Apologies for the bumps, folks.</i>

14:35.457 --> 14:37.585
<i>We are attempting to maneuver</i>
<i>around the worst of it,</i>

14:37.668 --> 14:41.714
<i>but these headwinds have limited</i>
<i>our progress to negative five knots.</i>

14:41.797 --> 14:44.842
<i>In the meantime, sit back, relax,</i>
<i>and please secure anything</i>

14:44.925 --> 14:46.677
<i>that could become a projectile.</i>

14:49.096 --> 14:51.390
Look at this. We nearly tripled our stack.

14:51.807 --> 14:52.850
Whoa.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.476
Could have been more.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.937
First rule of dice play,
quit while you're ahead.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.397
Or have more courage.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.153
Hey, are you guys hearing that?
Things popcorning like crazy.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.654
Sounds like a fuel issue.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.449
Are you thinking in the tank
or are we talking corrupted lines?

15:08.532 --> 15:11.160
Be easy enough to tell
with a quick snake assay.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.787
I'm sure the Captain would love
to hear your critiques.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.122
CONSTANCE: We'll wait here for you.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.917
Sorry for boring you.
Are you interested in money?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.501
Only for what it can buy.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.008
Way to go, Sticky!

15:26.800 --> 15:29.470
-That's incredible.
-How?

15:29.553 --> 15:33.182
-I used the Hi-Opt card counting system.
-Hi-Opt?

15:34.516 --> 15:38.854
STICKY: <i>Every card's assigned the value
of either one, zero, or minus one.</i>

15:39.647 --> 15:42.942
<i>I tracked each card on the table,</i>
<i>then added the card's values as I play,</i>

15:43.025 --> 15:44.318
<i>keeping a count for the aces</i>

15:44.401 --> 15:46.111
<i>and a running count
for all the other cards.</i>

15:47.237 --> 15:50.157
<i>With that info,</i>
<i>I determined my betting odds</i>

15:50.240 --> 15:52.409
<i>were sufficiently high</i>
<i>to justify my wager.</i>

15:53.994 --> 15:56.163
-Double it.
-On 17?

15:59.708 --> 16:01.877
Wait. You cheated?

16:01.961 --> 16:02.920
I didn't cheat.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.673
I used math to gain a slight
statistical advantage.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.967
I learned it in the math club
at Boatwright.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.927
I knew that school was good for something.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.054
-Sticky...
-STICKY: What?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.932
Is it frowned upon in a casino? Yes.

16:15.015 --> 16:18.102
Is it legal in many countries? Absolutely.

16:18.185 --> 16:21.063
Well, we definitely cheated.
No gray area there.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.524
-What?
-I shaved the dice.

16:26.443 --> 16:30.030
Never touch a bet once it's placed.
An infant knows that.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.913
(all cheer)

16:39.456 --> 16:42.668
-You cheated.
-The goal was to win money.

16:42.751 --> 16:46.338
Money that we need if we're going to find
Mr. Benedict and Number Two.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.800
So, I won that money.
I don't see what the problem is.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.302
Machiavellian. Respect.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.514
I solved a problem
and found a mechanical solution.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.517
You call it cheating. I call it ingenuity.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.145
Whatever it is,
it's no different than stealing.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.899
We should give back our winnings.
All of them.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.694
-It's only right.
-We need that money.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.696
We do, but not like this.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.991
Mr. Benedict asked us to cheat.
Last year, remember?

17:14.074 --> 17:16.702
On a test. This is different.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.788
Those people whose money we took
have nothing to do with this.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.998
They're innocent victims.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.377
I do admire the beauty of the math,

17:25.461 --> 17:28.797
but I shouldn't have used it
with other people's money.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.174
None of us should have.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.264
Fine. Don't expect me
to be happy about it.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.642
How will your moral victory taste
when Benedict's in the ground?

17:43.604 --> 17:45.314
We'll find another way to get the money.

17:47.524 --> 17:52.821
You're telling me I've been swindled
by children?

17:54.323 --> 17:59.620
And it was wrong, very wrong,
which is why we, all of us...

18:00.621 --> 18:04.333
unanimously decided
to return our winnings.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.251
It's all there.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.004
Twenty-five, fifty, seventy-five...

18:09.088 --> 18:11.507
Six. Five.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.009
He's really slamming those around.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.596
No telling what a man
so humiliated will do.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.681
Great idea, Reynie.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.725
We're not just gonna be broke,
we're gonna be dead.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.103
Five, six, seven...

18:25.270 --> 18:30.526
Have a good rest of your trip,
and we wish you <i>bonne chance</i>.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.862
Stop.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.742
Come here.

18:40.452 --> 18:45.833
You hand over a stack like that
and expect to just walk on out of here?

18:45.916 --> 18:48.752
Yes, sir. That was the expectation?

18:49.503 --> 18:54.466
In all my years,
I've seen my fair share of charlatans,

18:54.550 --> 18:58.512
-bandits, thieves, rascals...
-We...

18:58.595 --> 19:03.642
...hoodwinks, trust breakers,
oath scoffers, dream crushers.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.353
The lowest of the low.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.522
But you know what I've never seen?

19:10.107 --> 19:12.276
Anyone come clean.

19:14.862 --> 19:18.282
That's an honor
and it's hard to find anywhere,

19:18.824 --> 19:22.369
much less on the lawless,
free for all called the sea.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.664
It deserves to be rewarded.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.090
Oh. Oh!

19:38.802 --> 19:41.138
See? Honesty does pay.

19:41.221 --> 19:44.308
-You're truly magical, Reynie.
-Thank you, Constance.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.186
You turned a large stack of money
into a small stack of money

19:47.269 --> 19:48.645
with the wave of your morals.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.647
Do not move.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.902
You're an insult
to real water polo players everywhere.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.946
Selling bad tactics,
suboptimal muscle density.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.159
-And why would we care about that?
-I have so many reasons.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.037
You're coming with us.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.455
Never going to happen.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.916
(breathes deeply)

20:09.625 --> 20:14.129
There's an old German saying,
popular among the Alsatians.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.507
<i>Alles hat ein ende,
nur die wurst hat zwei.</i>

20:18.300 --> 20:21.303
"Everything has an end,
only a sausage has two."

20:21.720 --> 20:23.013
Which applies to us how?

20:24.264 --> 20:25.307
This game is over.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.727
This ship is finite,
there is nowhere to hide.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.063
-Surren...
-CANNONBALL: Surrender!

20:32.481 --> 20:36.360
-Surrender!
-KATE: Sir, you have to stop them.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.903
-They're trying to kidnap us.
-Enough.

20:42.532 --> 20:45.911
-I know what you are.
-Yes. Okay. We're gamblers.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.497
-And things got out of control.
-But we're reformed.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.791
Ready to go on an anti-gambling mission.

20:51.792 --> 20:55.420
No. You're stowaways.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.923
(pensive music)

21:06.223 --> 21:10.435
-GIANNI: Worried you'd be late today.
-Gianni. You wound me.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.771
You see me every day,
same time, never late.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.064
That's true, you're never late.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.650
MAN: You are going to love
what I brought you.

21:16.733 --> 21:20.529
While I may not know you personally,
you have to understand,

21:20.612 --> 21:25.367
I care about each
and every one of you deeply.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.125
My purpose is simple,

21:33.959 --> 21:39.172
to open your eyes to something
which has been lost for so many of us.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.674
Happiness.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.011
Which is so fundamental,
we fail to see it.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.305
And I ask nothing in return.

21:52.894 --> 21:55.689
I'm duly informing you
that the four of you,

21:55.772 --> 21:58.191
having secreted yourselves
aboard this vessel,

21:58.275 --> 22:01.695
are being held for gross violation
of international maritime law,

22:01.778 --> 22:04.823
section 32.8, section C.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.868
You know, we just heard the seas
referred to as "lawless,"

22:07.951 --> 22:09.453
which I thought was an eye-opening--

22:09.536 --> 22:11.663
Whoever said that is a madman or a fool.

22:13.623 --> 22:16.335
You have no idea
who my parents are, do you?

22:16.960 --> 22:20.380
Well, I know they're not on this vessel.
As such, walk.

22:20.464 --> 22:24.092
Surely you know Alice Potrykus
and Yevgeni Potrykus IV?

22:25.427 --> 22:29.389
I've... rarely heard those names
spoken above a whisper.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.726
A spy trawler with no place for a baby.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.978
They had to give me away.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.398
They left me to be raised
by a pack of Yukon wolves.

22:39.358 --> 22:43.445
It was the wolves who taught me
the meaning of being human.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.197
Hm. Ironic.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.615
That's absurd.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.493
And thus, true to life.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.919
Let's go. You're coming with me.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.380
ANNOUNCER: <i>Good news from the cockpit.</i>

23:01.463 --> 23:05.300
<i>Looks like we're finally past
the worst of the inclement weather.</i>

23:05.384 --> 23:06.551
<i>Hopefully, like me,</i>

23:06.635 --> 23:11.640
<i>you can appreciate the raw</i>
<i>and terrifying beauty of nature's power.</i>

23:12.182 --> 23:13.725
Why does it feel like we're descending?

23:13.809 --> 23:16.686
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Which has unfortunately left its mark.</i>

23:16.770 --> 23:19.314
<i>We're experiencing
a very slight deflation issue.</i>

23:19.398 --> 23:22.150
<i>So we'll be rerouting
for an emergency landing</i>

23:22.234 --> 23:24.027
<i>in the Northern Iberian Plains.</i>

23:24.111 --> 23:25.278
(all murmuring)

23:25.362 --> 23:26.988
<i>For proper balance configuration,</i>

23:27.072 --> 23:29.741
<i>we will need to jettison luggage</i>
<i>from the cargo hold.</i>

23:29.825 --> 23:31.785
<i>We'll have you on the ground soon.</i>

23:31.868 --> 23:34.955
<i>And thank you for flying</i>
<i>with Atalanta Aeronautique.</i>

23:38.959 --> 23:40.794
(horn honks)

23:41.920 --> 23:43.463
CAPTAIN NOLAND:
Well, I must say, I was expecting

23:43.547 --> 23:46.007
a more rough and tumble bunch.

23:46.091 --> 23:50.595
But the sea teaches us,
expectation is a sister to folly.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.806
They were hiding out
in the engine room, sir.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.683
Hm. Like rats.

23:54.766 --> 23:58.061
-One could say.
-No matter.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.313
They'll soon be in the brig,
along with the other pests.

24:00.397 --> 24:03.066
And then, on to maritime court.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.362
I do hope they're more lenient
than last time.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.531
Do you remember
the last stowaways we found?

24:10.198 --> 24:13.326
I'd rather not. A haunting tale.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.661
Please, if we could just...

24:14.744 --> 24:18.123
Do not listen to them, Captain,
he's a liar, they're all liars.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.125
We're not the only ones.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.461
We know you're lying
about the speed of the ship.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.588
You should change its name
to The Lugubrious.

24:24.671 --> 24:28.633
Well, sometimes, even the best
maritime equipment can be a little off.

24:28.717 --> 24:29.718
My point exactly.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.721
We're going slower than you think,
and we'll never get to Lisbon on time

24:32.804 --> 24:35.390
with the ship's faulty combustion
to oxygenation ratio.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.976
The ship has never had an issue
with its COR before.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.269
Well, it does now.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.938
I heard it down in the engine room.
But not to worry.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.233
My friend here has diagnosed the issue.
Sticky?

24:45.317 --> 24:46.610
It sounds like seawater.

24:46.693 --> 24:49.529
It's leaking into the fuel tank,
creating a hotbed of electrolysis,

24:49.613 --> 24:51.823
-causing exothermic reaction.
-That's enough.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.201
You're all going to the brig,
seawater or not.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.286
What if we told you
we could fix the problem?

24:56.369 --> 24:58.872
Are we entering
some sort of a negotiation?

24:58.955 --> 25:00.790
They'll say anything to get free.

25:00.874 --> 25:03.752
Not anything,
just a solution to your engine issue.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.963
If you let us go.

25:08.173 --> 25:11.134
A late arrival
will be the last straw for me.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.679
I'd be a pariah. Release them.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.515
But, sir.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.852
Get us to Lisbon on time and you go free.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.896
That's an excellent starting point,

25:22.979 --> 25:26.274
but we'll also need to get past
the immigration checkpoint in Lisbon.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.194
Deal.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.496
Sadness isn't something to be ashamed of.

25:39.579 --> 25:43.291
We've all experienced it.
Me, perhaps, more than others.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.793
I learned at a very young age

25:44.876 --> 25:48.838
that abandonment and betrayal
can come from anywhere,

25:48.922 --> 25:51.216
even from what seems like sacred ground.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.344
From family.

25:55.387 --> 25:59.683
But my sadness did not last long
because I didn't let it.

26:01.351 --> 26:05.480
I simply chose to open the valve
deep inside of me

26:05.564 --> 26:07.941
and let my true happiness,

26:08.024 --> 26:10.151
the happiness safe from all intrusions,

26:10.235 --> 26:14.322
that be my North Star.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.616
(applause)

26:19.869 --> 26:21.871
(quirky music)

26:34.509 --> 26:36.511
Where to hide? Where to hide?

26:37.512 --> 26:38.722
Oh.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.404
-Sebastian!
-Sebastian!

26:54.988 --> 26:57.490
JILLSON: I'm worried.
It's not like Sebastian to miss dinner.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.992
JACKSON: It's not like him at all.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.745
-Sebastian?
-Sebastian?

27:05.665 --> 27:07.167
Sebastian, are you okay?

27:09.794 --> 27:12.505
-That's not promising.
-No, it is not.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.134
Blink if you hear us, Sebastian.

27:19.095 --> 27:20.680
Seems our time is up.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.975
But our journey is just beginning.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.771
Thank you for joining me.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.481
And remember...

27:31.316 --> 27:35.278
inside of you, inside of all of us...

27:35.987 --> 27:41.785
is the profound power to be happy.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.580
Let us seize the power...

27:47.791 --> 27:49.084
together.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.549
(soft chuckles)

27:58.385 --> 28:00.387
(chuckles)

28:03.181 --> 28:08.103
INFORMATION
AGRICULTURE

28:10.522 --> 28:14.359
Captain, we were not expecting you
for another two hours.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.737
They call us the <i>Shortcut</i> for good reason.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.407
-He's good. Let him through.
-Captain.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.331
(indistinct PA chatter)

28:38.800 --> 28:41.594
Welcome to the city of Seven Hills.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.889
(thuds)

28:57.610 --> 28:58.653
(sighs)

28:58.737 --> 29:00.989
Well, I can't thank you enough.

29:01.448 --> 29:05.076
I only hope that the <i>Shortcut</i>
was as kind to you as you were to her.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.246
<i>Boa sorte.</i> Godspeed.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.332
Oh, and, Sticky, is it?

29:11.958 --> 29:15.879
In case you ever decide you want a job
in combustion analysis, uh...

29:17.297 --> 29:18.631
call this number.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.509
It's our home office.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.936
Let's go. Those water polo players
could be anywhere.

29:32.812 --> 29:35.857
Don't worry. I handled them.

29:38.526 --> 29:42.989
Do you know the ecological damage that
even one single tangerine could inflict?

29:44.949 --> 29:47.076
-Take them away.
-Wait.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.205
No. Those are not our tangerines.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.707
Those are not our tangerines.

29:53.500 --> 29:57.212
I have a citrus allergy even. Wait, no!

29:57.295 --> 29:59.422
Spare me the lecture, Reynard.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.008
No lecture. Great work.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.469
You're maturing.

30:13.144 --> 30:17.398
STICKY: Look at us.
Four kids alone in a foreign country.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.859
I'm not sure how that pencils out.

30:20.777 --> 30:24.697
It may just be me,
but it doesn't feel like we're alone.

30:24.781 --> 30:28.326
Every time we find a new clue,
I can hear Mr. Benedict's voice.

30:28.409 --> 30:29.494
He's speaking to us.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.497
And saying, "Catch a cab
to the Saint Apollo train station

30:32.580 --> 30:33.623
and find the next clue."

30:35.416 --> 30:38.044
-I hope they're okay.
-They have to be.

30:38.127 --> 30:40.588
They're both strong,
highly intelligent people.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.591
Mr. Benedict is not strong.

30:44.092 --> 30:47.428
He's a glass house held together
by desperate optimism.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.138
Hey, 119.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.851
-Hey, Hooves.
-That guy? Again?

30:55.770 --> 30:57.689
Must be hard to see.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.774
(indistinct chatter in distance)

31:01.442 --> 31:03.278
Hey, I just put it together.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.114
-You're Reynie Muldoon.
-I am.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.658
This guy talks about you all the time.

31:08.741 --> 31:10.451
You're his best friend, right?

31:14.873 --> 31:17.876
Hey, take care, Sticky.
Nice meeting you all.

31:25.174 --> 31:27.802
(telephone ringing)

31:28.970 --> 31:32.682
-What is it?
-Our Europe-wide dragnet has caught...

31:33.808 --> 31:36.227
-some fish.
-What?

31:36.311 --> 31:38.980
I'm with team three at the Port of Lisbon.

31:39.063 --> 31:42.191
As you thought,
people are coming for your brother.

31:42.275 --> 31:45.570
-His circle of children...
-Society of children.

31:46.571 --> 31:50.950
Right, of course.
Society of children has arrived.

31:51.826 --> 31:56.164
-On their own.
-Really? Interesting. Just the children?

31:57.540 --> 32:01.461
Wow, they've proven to be
my only true adversaries.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.713
I respect them deeply.

32:05.214 --> 32:06.799
Deeply enough to...

32:08.259 --> 32:11.763
-treat them without mercy.
-Understood.

32:13.014 --> 32:16.434
-Anyone speaks Portuguese?
-Actually, yeah, kinda.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.353
Curtain's gray man.

32:19.437 --> 32:22.649
-STICKY: That's definitely him.
-Get in! Get in! Get in!

32:22.732 --> 32:24.943
(engine rumbles)

32:26.778 --> 32:30.281
(in Portuguese)
Well, no, please. We would like...

32:30.365 --> 32:32.116
-(in English) Go! Go! Go!
-Go! Go! Go!

32:32.200 --> 32:33.826
REYNIE (in Portuguese): Go please now!

32:36.704 --> 32:38.706
(ominous music)

32:44.712 --> 32:46.714
(closing theme music)
