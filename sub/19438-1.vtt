00:34.953 --> 00:35.745
Humans?

00:35.828 --> 00:36.996
So tiny!

00:39.916 --> 00:41.626
Why poke my foot?

00:42.085 --> 00:45.213
Monk Tang, over here!

00:45.296 --> 00:45.964
Monk Tang.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.257
Over here!

00:48.383 --> 00:50.385
You've been asleep for ages.

00:51.302 --> 00:52.887
We wanted to wake you...

00:53.304 --> 00:54.889
We have good news...

00:55.431 --> 00:57.225
Sorry.

00:58.518 --> 00:59.394
Sorry.

00:59.477 --> 01:00.520
Sorry.

01:00.603 --> 01:04.022
Monk Tang, we have great news to tell you.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.818
Congratulations!

01:06.901 --> 01:08.236
You're in the place...

01:08.319 --> 01:11.030
...you've always dreamed of.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.114
This is India?

01:12.156 --> 01:13.616
Correct!

01:14.242 --> 01:15.577
India

01:16.160 --> 01:18.538
I've reached my destination at last.

01:18.705 --> 01:20.832
Sorry.

01:25.295 --> 01:26.629
Master.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.718
You've shrunk too?

01:39.267 --> 01:41.769
Master, why are you in India too?

01:42.312 --> 01:45.106
Monk Tang, you haven't let me down.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.774
You wanted 22 sutras.

01:46.858 --> 01:50.403
They're loaded on 10 horse carts.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.904
They're yours if you want them.

01:51.988 --> 01:53.990
Help yourself.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.076
But the main reason I'm here today...

01:57.327 --> 01:59.162
...is to give you an award.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.246
What award?

02:00.413 --> 02:02.415
For living this long.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.761
Try it on.

02:16.387 --> 02:17.847
What an honor.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.517
I like it.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.227
Discreet or bold...

02:23.311 --> 02:25.063
You control it.

02:25.730 --> 02:28.399
The right side is brighter, you see?

02:28.983 --> 02:31.736
You can even it up.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.738
May we ask for a few words?

02:33.821 --> 02:35.198
I need to think about it.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.410
Master!

02:39.494 --> 02:40.745
What... is going on?

02:40.870 --> 02:42.538
Have fun!

03:04.811 --> 03:07.105
Monk! Pay your way...

03:07.188 --> 03:08.548
...or the boss will throw you out.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.400
I know.

03:13.236 --> 03:16.948
Blindfold knife-throwing!
Amazing physical feats!

03:17.031 --> 03:20.410
Roll up, roll up! Don't miss this!

03:26.541 --> 03:30.378
Our guest stars are travelers heading west...

03:31.504 --> 03:32.922
The pig, the fish and the monkey.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.341
Greatest show on earth.

03:35.758 --> 03:39.470
Only two cents per person.

03:39.554 --> 03:41.347
How about half price?

03:41.431 --> 03:42.890
Buy one, get one free?

03:43.182 --> 03:44.350
It's a deal.

03:44.434 --> 03:45.560
Thank you.

03:46.561 --> 03:47.937
Show time.

03:48.646 --> 03:51.315
The gorgeous... Pigsy!

03:52.775 --> 03:53.775
Woman...

03:56.779 --> 03:58.656
What's your name? Your age?

03:58.740 --> 03:59.949
Crazy!

04:00.199 --> 04:01.367
The great fish monster...

04:01.451 --> 04:03.661
...Sandy!

04:16.423 --> 04:18.341
How dare you scare my kid! Shame on you!

04:19.010 --> 04:20.010
Money back!

04:21.012 --> 04:22.137
Money back?

04:22.221 --> 04:23.848
Making me angry?

04:25.224 --> 04:26.392
Money back!

04:29.103 --> 04:30.188
Give us another chance!

04:30.271 --> 04:31.105
We have more to show you.

04:31.189 --> 04:32.189
Give us another chance!

04:32.899 --> 04:33.983
If we don't like 'em...

04:34.066 --> 04:36.068
You pay everyone back double!

04:37.487 --> 04:38.571
All right.

04:39.572 --> 04:42.200
His Excellency... The Monkey King!

04:49.916 --> 04:51.292
Fake! Money back!

04:52.627 --> 04:54.629
Monkey, do some somersaults!

04:54.712 --> 04:56.547
Paying back double will clean us out!

05:09.060 --> 05:10.520
All right...

05:10.978 --> 05:12.873
Your generosity will
keep us fed for several days.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.065
Take it back.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.859
Boss, this monk cheats!

05:16.943 --> 05:19.821
He can't pay us back! Throw him out!

05:19.904 --> 05:22.114
You're a disgrace to my circus! Scram!

05:25.660 --> 05:27.578
Boss, we're not circus people.

05:27.954 --> 05:29.038
We are Buddhist monks.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.582
Our road is long and hard, we are hungry.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.584
And I'm sick!

05:35.211 --> 05:36.337
My body aches.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.006
It's been days since I last ate.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.175
So pitiful? Come...

05:42.885 --> 05:44.428
These two buns...

05:44.804 --> 05:45.680
...are for righteous men.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.765
Men who deserve help.

05:47.849 --> 05:49.267
Are you worthy?

05:49.892 --> 05:51.370
We're really from the Great Tang Dynasty.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.271
We conquer demons.

05:54.313 --> 05:57.692
Monkey, show them your skills.

06:13.833 --> 06:14.917
Hit me.

06:15.877 --> 06:17.086
Hit me

06:17.295 --> 06:18.629
I can't do that, Brother Monkey

06:19.171 --> 06:21.215
I'm not suicidal.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.509
Shall I hit you then?

06:24.010 --> 06:25.887
I'd like that even less, Brother Monkey.

06:26.304 --> 06:28.139
Fine, you only live once, I'll hit you.

06:32.685 --> 06:34.061
Brother, you're hard as a rock!

06:34.145 --> 06:36.355
It's <i>as</i> if my whole arm is shattered!

06:36.564 --> 06:38.858
Pretty boy, have you no shame?

06:39.734 --> 06:40.794
Watch some more before you complain.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.361
And stop poking me

06:42.445 --> 06:43.445
I need to.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.118
Hit me... Master wants us to perform

06:49.660 --> 06:51.495
I'm hungry, I have no strength.

06:52.121 --> 06:53.247
Again.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.250
That's no excuse for shirking.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.710
Hit me, stupid!

06:57.960 --> 06:59.479
I've heard there are
fake demon-vanquishers around.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.131
They've left many people hurt.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.382
You must be the ones!

07:04.300 --> 07:05.134
Yes, we're guilty.

07:05.217 --> 07:08.179
The problem is that my disciples are too strong.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.181
Sure, you just keep on bragging...

07:23.653 --> 07:25.196
One blow is enough.

07:25.488 --> 07:26.781
Stop now.

07:33.037 --> 07:34.038
That'll do for now.

07:35.915 --> 07:38.000
You're so desirable!

07:38.334 --> 07:39.669
Let me stoke your fires a little.

07:41.379 --> 07:42.713
No! Get off me!

07:43.005 --> 07:44.757
Monkey, don't just squat there.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.258
Do something about it!

08:17.289 --> 08:19.834
I'm so sorry, that's really all from us.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.544
No charge for what you've just seen.

08:21.627 --> 08:22.627
Great sir.

08:22.670 --> 08:26.048
Your performance is more than impressive.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.926
Say no more, try this candied fruit.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.386
Let us be brothers.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.972
Brother, now you've seen what they can do

08:34.056 --> 08:35.933
I wish they could control themselves better.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.562
We really do conquer demons.

08:39.645 --> 08:40.645
Of course you do.

08:41.731 --> 08:44.025
Monkey, come and apologize.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.659
Pick up your head-band.

08:57.788 --> 08:58.873
Put it on.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.293
Wear it properly now

09:03.169 --> 09:04.628
I'm doing it.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.340
You talk while chewing a twig? Bad monkey!

09:10.342 --> 09:12.470
I won't if you don't like it.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.641
But stop calling me 'Bad monkey'!

09:18.851 --> 09:20.478
I can call you that if I want to.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.228
Bad monkey.

09:21.312 --> 09:22.605
Bad monkey.

09:22.688 --> 09:23.981
Great!

09:24.315 --> 09:27.026
Say it just one more time...

09:27.276 --> 09:28.486
I'm scared.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.654
It's horrible! Makes me so scared!

09:30.738 --> 09:32.281
Aren't you all afraid?

09:40.289 --> 09:42.249
Even if he throws tantrums.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.001
You can't be lenient.

09:44.085 --> 09:45.878
Let's all scold him together

09:45.961 --> 09:47.963
1, 2, 3...

09:48.047 --> 09:50.758
Bad monkey!

09:55.805 --> 09:57.014
"My boy, my boy..."

09:57.098 --> 10:00.309
"Why are you so bad?"

10:01.227 --> 10:02.603
"Bullying, cheating..."

10:02.686 --> 10:06.023
"Why make me so sad?"

10:06.148 --> 10:08.234
"Learn to be a good boy."

10:08.943 --> 10:10.694
"Learn to love."

10:11.779 --> 10:14.406
"Care for others."

10:14.490 --> 10:16.367
"Fill your heart with color"

10:17.952 --> 10:19.703
<i>“My good boy...“</i>

10:19.954 --> 10:23.290
"Hurry back to me."

10:23.457 --> 10:25.543
"My embrace..."

10:29.046 --> 10:30.714
<i>“My good boy...“</i>

10:30.798 --> 10:33.884
"Be sincere."

10:33.968 --> 10:38.305
"You're the one I love most."

10:49.400 --> 10:52.153
Master, ours is just a small enterprise.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.905
What you see is all we have.

10:55.406 --> 10:57.366
If it's not enough for you...

10:57.449 --> 10:59.785
...then all we can is offer our lives.

10:59.869 --> 11:01.162
<i>Stop.</i>

11:01.829 --> 11:05.124
First, I'm not here to extort anything from you.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.625
Second...

11:07.376 --> 11:09.086
Never mind, I won't say it.

12:07.645 --> 12:12.358
JOURNEY TO THE WEST:
THE DEMONS STRIKE BACK

12:24.161 --> 12:25.746
When did your mother...

12:25.829 --> 12:26.956
...start behaving like this?

12:27.248 --> 12:28.666
A few days ago

12:28.874 --> 12:30.167
I don't know why.

12:30.251 --> 12:32.002
Soon after we moved here...

12:32.086 --> 12:33.462
...she began talking nonsense.

12:36.090 --> 12:37.174
If I approach her...

12:37.967 --> 12:41.053
...she scratches me like a mad thing.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.847
I have no idea why she's like this

12:43.931 --> 12:46.141
I'm completely exhausted.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.394
Luckily my two daughters...

12:48.519 --> 12:50.521
...help me take care of my mother.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.566
It wears them out.

12:55.276 --> 12:56.860
They're your daughters?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.279
God-daughters.

12:58.737 --> 12:59.738
How old are they?

12:59.822 --> 13:00.864
They just turned sixteen.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.575
They look a little haggard.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.161
They've been working too hard.

13:06.245 --> 13:07.746
They were radiant before.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.331
How horrible!

13:09.915 --> 13:12.209
Grandma, have some congee.

13:12.293 --> 13:15.129
You haven't eaten all day.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.006
Another fit?

13:19.842 --> 13:21.010
Ma, are you all right?

13:23.095 --> 13:24.221
Ma, Ma, Ma...

13:24.847 --> 13:27.099
It's me... Calm down.

13:32.688 --> 13:33.564
Quick! The exorcism mirror!

13:33.647 --> 13:34.647
Coming right up!

13:35.107 --> 13:36.501
Ten thousand gods send down thunderbolts...

13:36.525 --> 13:38.569
...to reveal the hidden demons!

13:39.737 --> 13:41.071
Show yourself!

13:45.409 --> 13:47.661
All demons, be revealed!

13:53.334 --> 13:55.586
Nothing?

13:56.795 --> 13:59.840
But the whole room smells foul.

14:00.591 --> 14:02.468
If it's not her body, then...

14:03.135 --> 14:05.179
...maybe she has second sight.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.848
She sees the demons in others.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.767
That's why she's so scared.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.853
Could it be those two?

14:16.023 --> 14:18.275
I've put up with them for too long.

14:18.359 --> 14:20.402
All demons, be revealed!

14:23.822 --> 14:26.575
Too bright! I can't see anything!

14:26.950 --> 14:28.410
What? Not them either.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.914
Could it be...

14:41.840 --> 14:43.342
A hairy crab!

14:56.814 --> 14:58.982
You bad monkey!

15:01.944 --> 15:03.320
You bad monkey!

15:07.074 --> 15:09.410
Bad monkey!

15:14.081 --> 15:15.082
Look at that.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.543
Master's whip is really strong today.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.004
That whip has kept Monkey
under control for 500 years.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.714
It needs to be strong.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.665
You knew those two were shape-shifters.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.400
Why didn't you stop them?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.110
You asked me to perform.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.278
Sol did.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.696
And what did you perform?

15:45.863 --> 15:47.048
I asked for a couple of somersaults.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.699
And you destroyed a family!

15:49.241 --> 15:51.243
Then you shouldn't have called me "Bad monkey".

15:51.326 --> 15:54.788
You know that makes me go berserk

15:55.080 --> 15:57.624
I didn't mean to call you that.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.126
Everyone knows I don't mean it.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.919
Such a small thing and you try to kill me?

16:01.003 --> 16:02.003
Such ruthless.

16:02.087 --> 16:04.214
Open your mouth!

16:05.257 --> 16:08.802
Wider! You want my life.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.434
Now I'm offering you my life.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.811
Bite! You're a coward if you don't.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.148
Hey, something to see here!

16:21.815 --> 16:22.608
Bite!

16:22.691 --> 16:23.775
Do it.

16:28.614 --> 16:29.854
Why did you treat me like that?

16:31.241 --> 16:33.118
Speak! Say something!

16:33.285 --> 16:34.285
Why do you keep doing it?

16:34.328 --> 16:36.622
Cheating me! Provoking me!

16:36.705 --> 16:40.292
Hurting me! Torturing me! Mistreating me!

16:41.919 --> 16:44.796
It seems our days of conquering demons...

16:46.924 --> 16:48.926
...have come to an end.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.514
Let's disband.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.140
"Disband"?

16:55.557 --> 16:58.644
Does "disband" mean he wants to kill us?

16:59.728 --> 17:00.729
Master!

17:04.107 --> 17:06.276
I understand why Master does these things.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.904
But please drink this medicine first.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.365
From now on... I'll be obedient.

17:13.075 --> 17:16.578
What are you saying? I'm not punishing you.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.832
Master, you surely know...

17:21.666 --> 17:24.336
My brothers and I... We are all of one heart.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.214
If you punish Brother Monkey...
Then my heart aches too.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.297
And my heart...

17:28.674 --> 17:31.093
...is really aching.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.473
That's so true.

17:36.557 --> 17:37.266
When I hit you.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.350
My heart really aches.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.993
Master, try it if you don't believe us.

17:42.521 --> 17:44.356
When I punish you...

17:45.023 --> 17:47.526
I suffer heartache too.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.242
If I'd set off to find the sutras on my own...

17:50.320 --> 17:51.738
I'd have got there long ago.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.008
Having you with me doesn't help at all

17:54.032 --> 17:56.493
I can subdue one hundred foes...

17:56.577 --> 17:57.578
...single-handed.

17:57.661 --> 17:58.741
Do I need to tell you this?

17:58.996 --> 18:02.165
I've mastered Buddha's Palm.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.750
Do I really need to tell you this?

18:04.626 --> 18:07.713
So it's not that
you're helping me to find the sutras

18:07.838 --> 18:10.716
I'm helping you
to make merit and learn Buddhism.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.884
Do I make myself crystal clear?

18:12.968 --> 18:14.344
Do you get it?

18:14.595 --> 18:15.971
Yes, we do.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.394
That's enough for now.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.896
Go to bed, we've got much to do tomorrow.

18:35.741 --> 18:37.409
"Sinful monkey!"

18:37.492 --> 18:40.454
<i>"I'll</i> show you my Buddha's Palm!"

19:19.117 --> 19:20.117
Did you miss me?

19:22.204 --> 19:24.331
He's even teasing Brother Monkey.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.174
Master's mind has reached such a high level.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.211
That's not Brother Monkey he's embracing.

19:29.503 --> 19:31.296
It's someone else.

19:44.810 --> 19:45.644
Amitabha, Amitabha.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.813
Master, you seemed happy last night.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.565
We were happy to see you happy.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.943
But we won't tell on you.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.570
What are you on about?

19:56.154 --> 19:56.947
No water left.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.699
Second Brother, fetch some water.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.243
Why do I have to do it?

20:01.326 --> 20:02.327
How did you come up...

20:02.411 --> 20:03.537
...up with that idea?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.622
Stop quarreling, <i>I'll</i> go.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.512
Alms giver, excuse me...

20:20.595 --> 20:21.513
I was just passing.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.598
May I trouble you for water to boil rice?

20:25.392 --> 20:26.935
There's no need for that.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.062
You're welcome to eat here

20:29.146 --> 20:30.856
I'm vegetarian.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.691
What luck!

20:32.774 --> 20:35.694
We're having vegetarian food.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.797
We're devout too, we share the same path.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.656
It's natural for us to share our meal.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.367
And you can stay after eating.

20:42.743 --> 20:45.454
We'll be able to compare notes.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.666
He's ill, won't he taste bad?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.961
Never mind, we can heal him first.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.088
It would be impolite to refuse.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.300
No need to cook come and eat here.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.135
What about my congee?

21:00.218 --> 21:02.012
I prepared it this morning.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.390
Your congee will be burnt.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.225
Go back and watch the fire.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.794
Alms giver, your medicine works a treat

21:33.877 --> 21:35.921
I feel better already.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.381
These three are my delinquent disciples.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.488
Nice to meet you.

22:02.239 --> 22:04.199
Nice to meet you.

22:05.283 --> 22:06.283
Nice to meet you.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.703
Nice to meet you.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.208
Don't flirt.

22:15.293 --> 22:17.379
Nice to meet you.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.589
To hell with that, what's nice about it?

22:20.382 --> 22:21.883
Sandy, what are you saying?

22:22.259 --> 22:23.677
I was cooking congee.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.303
What are you up to?

22:25.387 --> 22:26.513
"Nice, nice, nice..."

22:26.596 --> 22:28.348
What do you all think you're doing?

22:28.723 --> 22:31.017
I'm sorry, my disciple is a touch simple-minded.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.435
It doesn't matter.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.020
May I just ask you...

22:34.104 --> 22:36.106
Are there any demons here?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.525
Master, please don't scare me.

22:38.608 --> 22:39.943
Why would there be demons here?

22:40.694 --> 22:41.736
You're going too far.

22:42.946 --> 22:45.073
Why ask such a question?

22:46.283 --> 22:47.659
Actually...

22:47.742 --> 22:49.703
We conquer demons.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.539
I did wonder... Really?

22:52.622 --> 22:54.374
You've been so hospitable...

22:54.457 --> 22:55.876
But we have nothing to repay it.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.211
All I can offer is a one-off exorcism.

22:58.295 --> 23:01.673
Really? You're terribly kind...

23:02.299 --> 23:03.884
But, sad to say...

23:03.967 --> 23:05.886
There are no demons here.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.140
See my face?

23:10.724 --> 23:11.724
Hit me.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.436
Come on, quick!

23:14.519 --> 23:17.188
If you don't, <i>I'll</i> beat you to death.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.357
Really?

23:19.441 --> 23:20.984
Why?

23:26.948 --> 23:28.575
I told you to hit me, scum

23:29.117 --> 23:30.577
I'll ask you again.

23:30.744 --> 23:34.372
Hit me, you asshole!

23:37.792 --> 23:39.210
Have you lost it again?

23:39.294 --> 23:40.712
I'm not an asshole.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.964
You definitely are.

23:43.173 --> 23:45.050
But I was calling her an asshole, not you.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.551
Damn you!

23:46.843 --> 23:48.470
You assholes take me as your Master?

23:48.553 --> 23:49.553
Clear out of here.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.431
Clear out of here.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.015
Sorry about that.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.477
Get out, all of you.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.354
She kindly invited us to eat.

23:57.896 --> 24:00.774
You bang her table and ask her to hit you.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.067
And call her an asshole.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.902
Go and face the wall.

24:03.985 --> 24:04.778
Contemplate what you've done.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.489
What have you ever contributed to society?

24:07.572 --> 24:10.367
Don't come back until you figure it out.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.671
Come back!

24:23.088 --> 24:24.607
Master, we haven't figured it out yet.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.882
Don't give it any more thought.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.132
Come back!

24:27.509 --> 24:29.761
Still contemplating it.

24:29.844 --> 24:31.513
She's caught me!

25:04.212 --> 25:05.338
Rake.

25:09.718 --> 25:10.719
Up, up!

25:10.802 --> 25:11.803
Up, up!

25:12.178 --> 25:13.763
Quick, up!

25:17.726 --> 25:20.687
You can stop now.

25:46.921 --> 25:49.215
Master, time to show your hand.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.135
You're so kind.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.155
Beauty!

26:13.615 --> 26:15.617
Such long legs...

26:15.700 --> 26:17.118
- What're you doing?
- I like them

26:23.917 --> 26:25.335
I'm a spider!

26:25.418 --> 26:27.337
You must be kidding!

26:29.005 --> 26:30.215
I'm just a pig.

26:30.799 --> 26:31.799
I wasn't kidding.

26:38.932 --> 26:41.142
Your resistance makes me stronger.

26:46.356 --> 26:48.316
Don't go, I am talking to you!

27:57.427 --> 27:58.678
What's that noise?

27:58.845 --> 28:00.680
Don't worry, it's Sandy

28:01.306 --> 28:03.308
Sandy, are you all right?

28:04.642 --> 28:06.895
A bit poisoned, a bit dazed.

28:12.567 --> 28:15.737
Seems like time for me to step in now.

28:15.820 --> 28:18.448
Conquering demons takes sincerity.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.158
Lead them to benevolence.

28:20.241 --> 28:22.243
No violence necessary.

28:24.913 --> 28:29.959
"Without a knife, a butcher can be a Buddha."

29:04.702 --> 29:06.120
Stop!

29:06.704 --> 29:08.039
Monkey...

29:08.498 --> 29:09.874
You are too rude.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.518
Only a coolie needs to use such strength.

29:11.542 --> 29:12.542
Go away.

29:12.752 --> 29:13.795
Let me handle this.

29:20.885 --> 29:22.762
Brother Monkey, be more gentle

29:22.887 --> 29:24.597
I've only just got started with her.

29:24.681 --> 29:26.724
She has such long legs.

29:26.808 --> 29:27.892
A rare species though.

29:27.976 --> 29:28.976
Quiet.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.273
Let go.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.720
All done, Master.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.140
What?

30:07.682 --> 30:09.684
You finished her before I had a chance.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.060
What were you thinking?

30:11.477 --> 30:14.147
What, don't you know you were in great danger?

30:14.439 --> 30:16.566
She coulda swallowed you whole.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.234
You're lucky I strike fast

30:18.318 --> 30:19.336
I took her out with one blow.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.487
How many times have I told you?

30:21.571 --> 30:23.197
To conquer a demon, educate it.

30:23.281 --> 30:25.366
Didn't you see the smile on her face just now?

30:26.367 --> 30:27.660
Smile?

30:27.744 --> 30:29.384
She smiled at the prospect of eating you.

30:29.537 --> 30:30.913
Outrageous!

30:30.997 --> 30:33.249
That smile was so sincere.

30:35.418 --> 30:36.961
My smile is even more sincere.

30:37.045 --> 30:38.296
Guess: do I love you?

30:38.379 --> 30:39.964
Or will I kill you?

30:47.513 --> 30:48.431
Who the hell are you?

30:48.514 --> 30:50.141
How can I help you?

31:05.323 --> 31:07.075
Did you see that? He's so handsome.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.660
You're almost better-looking than me.

31:09.827 --> 31:11.412
You know that?

31:12.246 --> 31:13.956
Of course, you can't stand it?

31:14.082 --> 31:14.749
Can you?

31:14.832 --> 31:16.834
Of course not, how about you?

31:16.918 --> 31:19.754
What's Baldy doing up there?

31:19.837 --> 31:20.963
Thinking.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.090
About what?

31:22.173 --> 31:23.549
About Miss Duan.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.060
I don't care who he's thinking about.

31:35.186 --> 31:37.980
I can overlook
this baldy's propensity for violence.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.649
But he's started going too far.

31:39.774 --> 31:42.819
Lying beside me, swaying and fondling...

31:42.902 --> 31:45.488
Asking if I miss him...

31:45.571 --> 31:47.949
Just thinking of it gives me goosebumps.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.826
Well, that needs to stop.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.411
Why not just kill him?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.247
Forget it.

31:55.081 --> 31:58.167
You always dance to Baldy's tune.

31:58.626 --> 31:59.752
You can do nothing

31:59.836 --> 32:01.379
I'll pull out his tongue...

32:01.462 --> 32:02.380
...and tie it in a knot!

32:02.463 --> 32:04.674
What kind of tune would he sing then?

32:05.299 --> 32:08.094
He still knows the Buddha's Palm technique

32:08.386 --> 32:09.387
I'm not scared.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.472
If I break his arm...

32:11.556 --> 32:13.307
...how can use Buddha's sodding Palm?

32:20.440 --> 32:22.400
Master, how long have you been standing there?

32:23.860 --> 32:25.111
Just now

32:25.194 --> 32:26.696
I came to see how you're doing.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.656
Don't worry, I heard nothing.

32:31.075 --> 32:32.201
Master...

32:32.785 --> 32:34.078
How come you lost your voice?

32:34.162 --> 32:35.955
I haven't.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.038
Out here in the wild...

32:37.748 --> 32:40.877
...we shouldn't disturb others by being loud.

32:41.669 --> 32:42.503
Really?

32:42.587 --> 32:43.754
For sure.

32:43.838 --> 32:46.674
Have I ever... lied to you?

32:47.967 --> 32:50.470
All right, you all relax,
I'll just relieve myself

33:08.321 --> 33:09.780
Buddha, Buddha.

33:09.864 --> 33:11.991
My three disciples are unruly

33:12.074 --> 33:13.701
I have failed to teach them well

33:14.076 --> 33:15.745
I know three hundred songs for children.

33:15.828 --> 33:16.996
But nothing else

33:17.079 --> 33:19.916
I've been pretending to be capable.

33:20.541 --> 33:22.335
How can I go on like this?

33:22.418 --> 33:24.587
Now they are plotting to kill me.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.923
And I've lost my singing voice.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.966
Be merciful, Buddha.

33:29.133 --> 33:32.178
Teach me your holy Buddha's Palm.

33:32.261 --> 33:34.805
Your follower will be forever grateful.

33:38.601 --> 33:41.646
I beg you, please

33:44.232 --> 33:46.400
Buddha, do your hear me?

33:46.817 --> 33:49.362
Give me a sign please.

33:49.737 --> 33:51.989
Even a little fart would do...

34:00.790 --> 34:04.001
Pigsy, how long have you been there?

34:04.085 --> 34:06.796
Not long, I didn't see what you were doing.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.630
Don't worry, I didn't hear anything either

34:12.009 --> 34:13.636
I've been good to you.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.804
You know what you should do.

34:16.973 --> 34:18.431
What should I do?

34:18.516 --> 34:20.393
All I can do is be myself.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.728
What I was getting at is...

34:22.812 --> 34:25.815
"Silence is golden."

34:26.148 --> 34:28.900
Master, all I did was break wind.

34:28.985 --> 34:30.820
But all your threats and pressures...

34:30.902 --> 34:33.447
...weigh on me heavily.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.409
So that's your game.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.578
You should watch out

34:38.661 --> 34:40.079
I know where your family is.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.289
Understood.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.135
Monkey, what are you doing?

34:57.972 --> 34:59.849
You're the one who needs to watch out

35:00.433 --> 35:01.642
I'd like to experience...

35:01.726 --> 35:03.936
...my Master's holy Buddha's Palm.

35:04.478 --> 35:06.647
What are you talking about?

35:07.481 --> 35:08.774
You didn't get it?

35:09.233 --> 35:12.486
I want to compare strength with you.

35:17.366 --> 35:18.826
You run?

35:35.468 --> 35:36.677
"My boy, my boy."

35:36.927 --> 35:40.306
"Why are you so naughty?"

35:40.556 --> 35:41.974
"Bullying, cheating..."

35:42.058 --> 35:44.101
"Why behave that way?"

35:45.645 --> 35:47.229
"Learn to behave better."

35:47.396 --> 35:49.106
"Closeness, love."

35:50.107 --> 35:51.192
"Be tender in your heart."

35:51.275 --> 35:53.527
Damn Baldy, enough with the singing.

35:53.611 --> 35:55.112
Fight me!

35:55.946 --> 35:58.449
"Good child..."

36:22.848 --> 36:24.642
Where can you run to?

36:24.975 --> 36:27.353
All right.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.523
If that's what you really want,
I'll indulge you.

36:31.565 --> 36:33.818
So it's clobbering time.

36:33.943 --> 36:35.528
Wait, give me a moment.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.882
I was just toying with you, Master.

36:56.966 --> 37:00.052
Just working up a sweat.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.474
You scared me to death.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.786
What on earth are you up to now?

37:25.953 --> 37:27.163
None of your business.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.498
You're so handsome, you've gone bald...

37:29.582 --> 37:30.666
Do you mean that?

37:31.917 --> 37:33.461
I'd be a pig if I lied.

37:38.466 --> 37:39.300
How did it go?

37:39.383 --> 37:41.218
Did you tear Baldy to shreds?

37:41.302 --> 37:43.179
Was his blood running everywhere?

37:45.681 --> 37:48.100
Wait, have you really killed him?

37:49.268 --> 37:51.020
You tricked me.

38:10.539 --> 38:14.335
Pigsy, have you learnt
what "Silence is golden" means?

38:14.418 --> 38:16.587
I just did.

38:26.430 --> 38:29.266
Now you're poisoned, I have to pull you.

38:44.156 --> 38:45.699
Will you please stop dousing me?

38:45.866 --> 38:48.536
I caught a cold, my nose is runny.

38:51.789 --> 38:54.875
Caught a cold? Bullshit! You'd better die now.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.285
Less trouble for me that way.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.128
Monkey...

38:59.338 --> 39:02.424
When do you think
Sandy will turn back into a man?

39:03.801 --> 39:06.512
No idea, I have never paid attention to that.

39:06.595 --> 39:07.739
Master, you really want to know?

39:07.763 --> 39:08.556
Maybe...

39:08.639 --> 39:09.890
...not.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.477
"Bi-Qiu Kingdom."

40:01.609 --> 40:04.028
The Minister is here.

40:05.112 --> 40:07.531
Hail, your eminence.

40:22.254 --> 40:25.549
Master Tang is an eminent monk indeed.

40:25.633 --> 40:27.259
His bearing is graceful.

40:28.218 --> 40:32.014
My admiration is heartfelt.

40:46.862 --> 40:47.982
It's a pleasure to meet you.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.199
May I ask how your eminence knew I was coming?

40:50.282 --> 40:52.242
I am flattered...

40:53.410 --> 40:55.329
Most flattered.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.706
Master Tang's reputation precedes him.

40:57.790 --> 41:00.084
And your three brilliant companions...

41:00.626 --> 41:02.211
...are also awe-inspiring

41:02.294 --> 41:04.004
I learned that the four of you...

41:04.296 --> 41:05.881
...would pass by here.

41:05.965 --> 41:09.259
The king sent me to greet you here.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.887
Let's go to the palace.

41:15.432 --> 41:17.059
We can chat there.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.774
Neat trick.

41:25.651 --> 41:28.028
It's just a trifle.

41:32.992 --> 41:34.201
Don't play any more tricks.

41:34.284 --> 41:36.829
It wasn't me, I didn't do anything.

41:36.912 --> 41:38.122
What did I do?

41:45.754 --> 41:47.172
Bloom.

41:47.256 --> 41:48.590
Hey presto.

41:51.885 --> 41:52.636
Your eminence...

41:52.720 --> 41:55.014
There's something which puzzles me for a while.

41:55.806 --> 41:57.057
Are your magic tricks...

41:57.307 --> 41:59.226
...intended to seem fake?

42:00.728 --> 42:03.397
Master, we both know that in this world...

42:03.480 --> 42:05.774
...magic tricks are illusions.

42:05.858 --> 42:09.778
Why care whether they seem real or fake?

42:09.862 --> 42:11.196
Let's go.

42:16.785 --> 42:19.329
Cultivating oneself
is different from playing tricks.

42:19.413 --> 42:20.914
The crucial thing...

42:21.290 --> 42:22.374
...is what's in the heart.

42:23.167 --> 42:24.167
Master...

42:25.711 --> 42:27.546
You are bottling something up.

42:28.213 --> 42:29.923
What's on your mind?

42:30.591 --> 42:34.720
There's someone in your heart,
you yearn for her.

42:34.803 --> 42:37.139
You can't forget her

42:38.557 --> 42:40.309
I'm afraid you're wrong, there's not.

42:40.392 --> 42:41.560
Learning humanity...

42:41.643 --> 42:43.187
...is like having religious faith.

42:43.270 --> 42:48.442
Following your heart will keep you young.

42:49.276 --> 42:52.446
A person who can't be honest with himself...

42:52.529 --> 42:54.573
...is hypocritical.

42:54.656 --> 42:57.951
That's why I cultivate myself...

42:58.160 --> 42:59.995
...according to my heart's desires.

43:01.705 --> 43:04.833
So what 'cultivation' means to you is...

43:05.250 --> 43:07.753
Doing what I damn well like.

43:19.723 --> 43:21.225
What are they kneeling for?

43:21.308 --> 43:24.686
It's a game, losers have to kneel.

43:24.770 --> 43:27.606
The king has lately taken rejuvenation pills.

43:27.689 --> 43:29.316
Now he behaves like a child.

43:29.983 --> 43:33.403
It's as if he took my counsel
about following his heart.

43:34.863 --> 43:37.574
The king is easily coaxed.

43:37.741 --> 43:40.119
Simply fawn on him and you'll be well rewarded

43:41.578 --> 43:44.581
I'll expect my cut, of course.

43:44.665 --> 43:47.000
Let's split it by 50/50, ok?

43:48.710 --> 43:49.336
That's...

43:49.419 --> 43:51.713
I'm just joking,
you didn't think I was serious?

43:54.216 --> 43:56.301
Look, our beauties are greeting you.

43:57.469 --> 44:00.806
Impressive, I like it.

44:07.771 --> 44:08.772
Your Majesty...

44:08.981 --> 44:10.440
Honorable guests are here

44:10.524 --> 44:11.525
I am Tang

44:11.608 --> 44:12.669
I am crossing your great country.

44:12.693 --> 44:15.070
My three disciples and I
are here to pay our respects.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.573
<i>Hug, hug.</i>

44:22.369 --> 44:23.537
Splendid.

44:25.414 --> 44:27.166
Look, this king is sillier than our Master.

44:27.249 --> 44:28.375
No way.

44:28.709 --> 44:31.211
No-one is sillier than our Master.

44:36.216 --> 44:37.676
<i>Hug, hug.</i>

44:37.885 --> 44:41.054
Please respond in kind
to the king's high protocol.

44:42.764 --> 44:45.392
Too late, he's too stuck-up.

44:46.768 --> 44:48.187
Here.

44:55.652 --> 44:57.196
I hear that you conquer demons.

44:57.279 --> 44:59.156
It's true.

44:59.239 --> 45:01.867
Don't believe it, show me some tricks.

45:03.994 --> 45:05.454
I think Your Majesty is confused.

45:05.537 --> 45:07.664
Conquering demons is not an acrobatic trick.

45:07.831 --> 45:11.001
You will do as I order.

45:11.084 --> 45:13.128
You will speak... as I order.

45:13.212 --> 45:14.504
If you don't obey.

45:14.588 --> 45:16.465
You insult my dignity.

45:16.715 --> 45:18.155
Now <i>I'll</i> have your head chopped off.

45:18.217 --> 45:19.718
And hand it on the door.

45:20.510 --> 45:22.721
Great, this king has brilliant ideas.

45:22.804 --> 45:23.847
My kind of king.

45:23.931 --> 45:24.931
Men.

45:25.015 --> 45:26.015
Off with his head!

45:27.226 --> 45:29.019
Don't worry...

45:31.271 --> 45:32.439
Really, Minister?

45:32.522 --> 45:33.690
It's a joke

45:33.774 --> 45:35.275
I see...

45:35.359 --> 45:37.277
It doesn't seem so.

45:37.444 --> 45:38.570
Doesn't seem what?

45:41.240 --> 45:42.032
Your Majesty.

45:42.115 --> 45:44.201
We can perform a bit for you.

45:44.493 --> 45:47.371
Monkey, show His Majesty a few tricks.

45:48.372 --> 45:50.791
You ask a nobody to entertain me?

45:50.874 --> 45:52.584
That's a deliberate insult!

45:52.668 --> 45:53.794
Death penalty!

45:54.002 --> 45:56.129
Your Majesty, I must show you my tricks.

45:56.213 --> 45:58.048
Don't try to talk me out of it, <i>I'll</i> do it.

45:58.340 --> 46:01.009
Just give me a moment and I'll be with you.

46:02.177 --> 46:03.971
Get a move on.

46:04.179 --> 46:06.807
Master, are you really going to perform?

46:07.182 --> 46:09.393
Do I have any choice?

46:17.985 --> 46:19.278
He can't get through.

46:20.737 --> 46:21.488
What should we do?

46:21.571 --> 46:24.491
No big deal, just show them your Buddha's Palm.

46:24.574 --> 46:26.660
It's not a parlor trick.

46:27.411 --> 46:28.651
How about I take Master's form?

46:28.704 --> 46:30.184
I can perform something for the king.

46:30.580 --> 46:33.500
You just want to have your way with the maids.

46:33.583 --> 46:35.002
Go now if you have the guts.

46:38.755 --> 46:40.048
Stone, paper, scissors.

46:40.132 --> 46:41.383
Stone, paper, scissors.

46:43.051 --> 46:44.720
I know what...

46:44.886 --> 46:46.086
Use the talisman of obedience.

46:46.555 --> 46:48.557
That again? That's an old idea.

46:48.724 --> 46:50.684
New ideas are thin on the ground, boss.

46:50.767 --> 46:52.769
It will have to do.

46:52.853 --> 46:54.146
Stick it on him...

46:54.229 --> 46:55.939
And he'll do whatever I do.

46:56.023 --> 46:58.233
Identical movements.

47:43.278 --> 47:45.405
Damn it, chop him up

47:47.157 --> 47:49.076
I'd be doomed if you do striptease again

47:49.159 --> 47:50.202
I'm not going to do this.

47:50.285 --> 47:51.285
You don't trust me.

47:52.037 --> 47:53.037
I don't

47:54.373 --> 47:57.042
I'm sincerely trying to help.

47:58.126 --> 47:59.419
And you really don't trust me?

48:01.630 --> 48:02.798
I don't.

48:03.131 --> 48:05.675
If you find that something goes wrong
you can always stop me.

48:06.760 --> 48:07.760
You won't cheat me?

48:08.261 --> 48:09.805
I look like a cheat?

48:11.056 --> 48:12.265
Have I ever cheated you?

48:12.349 --> 48:13.767
More times than I can remember.

48:13.850 --> 48:15.060
You're right.

48:15.769 --> 48:16.853
You're an asshole.

48:31.952 --> 48:32.952
Good.

48:45.090 --> 48:46.383
Stop it.

48:52.013 --> 48:53.181
Where is he?

48:53.598 --> 48:55.892
You want to make me lose face again?

48:55.976 --> 48:56.976
Move.

49:04.484 --> 49:05.652
Out of the way...

49:15.620 --> 49:16.413
Poor Master

49:16.496 --> 49:17.914
I specialize in striptease.

49:17.998 --> 49:19.958
Master isn't as good as I am.

49:22.752 --> 49:23.879
Brother Monkey.

49:24.379 --> 49:25.505
Where did he go?

49:30.218 --> 49:31.218
<i>Stop.</i>

49:31.720 --> 49:32.846
Don't stop.

49:34.264 --> 49:35.390
No stopping.

49:35.474 --> 49:37.160
If you shout 'Stop' again, <i>I'll</i> have your head.

49:37.184 --> 49:38.643
You are joking?

49:40.270 --> 49:41.646
He's not joking.

49:41.730 --> 49:44.065
If you shout 'Stop' again,
you'll lose your head.

49:44.608 --> 49:45.817
Go on then.

49:58.622 --> 50:01.291
Great! Any more tricks up your sleeve?

50:05.670 --> 50:07.047
Go to hell.

50:07.130 --> 50:08.548
"Go to hell."

50:10.717 --> 50:11.593
Go to hell again!

50:11.676 --> 50:13.094
"Go to hell again!"

50:18.558 --> 50:20.644
He hit me.

50:21.561 --> 50:23.980
He hit me!

50:28.151 --> 50:29.444
Hurry! Quick!

50:29.528 --> 50:32.531
You must flee right away if the king cries.

50:44.543 --> 50:47.295
Master, I did my best to help you.

50:47.671 --> 50:49.214
But after what just happened...

50:49.297 --> 50:51.299
I'm afraid that...

50:54.094 --> 50:56.304
Your reputation cannot be repaired.

50:57.013 --> 50:58.390
Attendants.

50:59.266 --> 51:01.101
Here's some expenses money.

51:02.060 --> 51:04.145
Use it on your travels.

51:04.229 --> 51:06.815
Don't show up here again for 8 to 10 years.

51:06.898 --> 51:09.150
How can I accept, after all that...?

51:09.234 --> 51:11.611
Don't mention it, I know it's hard for you.

51:12.237 --> 51:13.780
Meetings are hard.

51:14.114 --> 51:16.032
But partings are harder.

51:16.116 --> 51:18.827
You and I may not meet again.

51:19.369 --> 51:20.453
Take care.

51:20.537 --> 51:21.705
Tang Tang.

51:26.251 --> 51:28.628
The Minister fancies you.

51:28.712 --> 51:30.630
You have a good chance with her.

51:30.714 --> 51:32.591
You always get so many dates, I envy you.

51:32.674 --> 51:35.677
You're really charming, so it's understandable.

51:37.554 --> 51:38.847
You bad monkey!

51:38.930 --> 51:40.640
How dare you say this to me?

51:40.807 --> 51:42.809
I feared it might go wrong.

51:42.892 --> 51:44.161
But I didn't expect to risk my life.

51:44.185 --> 51:46.438
Now kneel to me

51:46.688 --> 51:48.607
I'll beat you until you kneel.

51:49.107 --> 51:49.816
Kneel.

51:49.941 --> 51:50.942
Beat away.

51:51.192 --> 51:54.154
Did you ever think how it feels
to demean yourself in front of people?

51:54.279 --> 51:56.990
Now you know what crazy dancing feels like.

51:57.073 --> 51:58.450
So you know how bad I feel.

51:58.533 --> 51:59.409
You always make me...

51:59.492 --> 52:01.453
...kneel like a dog before you.

52:01.786 --> 52:03.538
You know how shaming that is?

52:03.913 --> 52:04.623
You're right

52:04.706 --> 52:05.957
I did manipulate you.

52:06.207 --> 52:07.767
So that you'd know how indignity feels.

52:11.546 --> 52:12.631
I see.

52:13.256 --> 52:15.133
Now that you've said all that...

52:15.383 --> 52:16.611
I'll finish you off with one slap.

52:16.635 --> 52:17.719
Go ahead!

52:18.136 --> 52:18.970
I'm ready for it

52:19.054 --> 52:21.014
I'd rather die than suffer this torture.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.224
All I wanted was to tell you...

52:23.475 --> 52:25.894
"Do unto others as you'd wish them..."

52:26.144 --> 52:27.646
"...to do unto you"

52:41.660 --> 52:43.995
I'm sorry, I'm at fault.

52:47.207 --> 52:49.584
Stop, don't try that on me.

52:51.711 --> 52:54.631
You're right,
we should be considerate for each other

52:56.091 --> 52:57.926
I've punished you by making you dance.

52:58.426 --> 52:59.946
By taking away your dignity in public.

53:00.136 --> 53:03.765
Now I realize what a loss of dignity feels like.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.058
How miserable it is

53:06.267 --> 53:08.687
I've been wrong to call you 'bad Monkey'

53:08.770 --> 53:11.481
I've beaten and scolded you all day long

53:12.607 --> 53:14.651
I've been oblivious to your feelings.

53:18.988 --> 53:20.156
The problem here is me.

53:20.740 --> 53:21.740
Not you

53:22.283 --> 53:24.119
I'm the one who spreads unhappiness.

53:24.953 --> 53:26.746
Now I realize my mistakes.

53:27.122 --> 53:29.249
Please forgive me this once.

53:29.749 --> 53:32.085
Give me one more chance, forgive me.

53:34.295 --> 53:36.256
Master's conscience is awakened at last.

53:36.673 --> 53:40.385
Don't you see he's using
"Advance by retreating"?

53:40.468 --> 53:42.470
To admit a mistake at the right time...

53:42.554 --> 53:44.180
...can win people's hearts.

53:44.347 --> 53:47.016
You see, it worked so well on brother Monkey.

53:49.144 --> 53:50.687
Master often seems silly.

53:50.770 --> 53:52.939
But he knows how to manage risk.

53:55.108 --> 53:56.276
Master...

53:57.610 --> 53:59.446
I guess I overdid it.

54:01.030 --> 54:02.407
Please get up.

54:05.535 --> 54:07.078
I actually care a lot for you

54:07.162 --> 54:09.247
I just didn't know how to express it.

54:10.290 --> 54:12.417
Master, I know in my heart...

54:12.500 --> 54:14.002
...how you feel about me.

54:14.085 --> 54:14.711
From now on, though...

54:14.794 --> 54:16.713
Don't ever make me do crazy dancing.

54:17.046 --> 54:18.286
But frankly speaking, Monkey...

54:18.381 --> 54:19.924
You're good at it.

54:20.842 --> 54:22.042
Don't even think that, Master.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.093
Never again.

54:23.136 --> 54:25.096
Please stop calling me 'Master'

54:25.180 --> 54:27.223
We're sworn brothers for life.

54:27.390 --> 54:30.143
So just call me 'Elder' from now on.

54:32.312 --> 54:33.438
Elder...

54:35.774 --> 54:36.775
Elder...

54:37.984 --> 54:39.319
See how well it works?

54:39.402 --> 54:42.489
They're all but kissing.

54:42.697 --> 54:44.240
Impressive, no?

54:45.533 --> 54:48.536
No entry to the palace, on pain of death.

54:49.788 --> 54:51.039
Pardon us.

54:51.122 --> 54:52.373
Master...

54:54.083 --> 54:55.083
Why are you back?

54:55.251 --> 54:55.919
Minister

54:56.002 --> 54:58.004
I've been thinking

54:58.087 --> 54:59.106
I need to restore my reputation

54:59.130 --> 55:00.799
I can't leave things as they were.

55:01.800 --> 55:04.302
Master, please get away while you still can.

55:04.385 --> 55:06.262
If you come back, there'll be carnage.

55:06.429 --> 55:09.057
Minister, I value my reputation.

55:09.140 --> 55:11.059
How can I be a good monk with a bad rep?

55:20.527 --> 55:22.111
How dare you return!

55:23.738 --> 55:25.114
Your Majesty, please calm down.

55:25.198 --> 55:27.367
Monk Tang has something to say.

55:27.450 --> 55:28.535
Your Majesty.

55:28.618 --> 55:30.429
What happened before had nothing to do with me.

55:30.453 --> 55:32.789
It was all caused by my errant disciple.

55:32.956 --> 55:35.083
So I've brought him to apologize to you.

55:35.166 --> 55:36.918
And while we're about it...

55:37.001 --> 55:38.545
We'll conquer a demon or two.

55:39.087 --> 55:40.129
Monkey...

55:52.183 --> 55:53.183
Hit me.

55:53.935 --> 55:54.936
Are you a pervert?

55:55.436 --> 55:56.104
Brilliant.

55:56.187 --> 55:59.440
A game is just the thing to appease the king.

55:59.524 --> 56:00.859
Master Monkey...

56:00.942 --> 56:02.861
Let me run through the rules of this game.

56:08.658 --> 56:09.742
Master...

56:09.826 --> 56:12.579
Don't you think you're doing a bit too much?

56:23.172 --> 56:24.465
You haven't eaten yet.

56:24.549 --> 56:25.758
Can't you do it harder?

56:25.842 --> 56:27.176
Is that it?

56:56.289 --> 56:57.457
Out of the way!

57:00.710 --> 57:01.961
Danger!

57:34.535 --> 57:35.912
Red Boy.

57:35.995 --> 57:37.288
Monkey.

57:37.372 --> 57:38.998
You show your true face at last.

57:39.540 --> 57:41.560
I saw from the start
there's something odd about you.

57:41.584 --> 57:42.251
According to legend...

57:42.335 --> 57:44.420
You own the long Firecloud Spear.

57:44.504 --> 57:45.254
And move on...

57:45.421 --> 57:47.548
The flaming Golden Wheel! Well met!

57:49.217 --> 57:50.718
So you're the Monkey King...

57:51.010 --> 57:52.387
...who has great strengths.

57:52.553 --> 57:53.553
Show your senior...

57:53.596 --> 57:54.847
...the best you can do.

58:22.542 --> 58:23.542
Playing foul?

58:25.795 --> 58:27.130
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

58:38.933 --> 58:40.560
Master, over here.

59:34.322 --> 59:36.157
Three-tier Fire!

59:36.240 --> 59:38.159
Take that!

01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:33.005
The palace...

01:00:33.089 --> 01:00:35.758
It's in ruins.

01:00:37.552 --> 01:00:40.096
Ruins...

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.140
Stupid monkey...

01:00:42.223 --> 01:00:43.223
Don't hide!

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:45.226
Come out to face me.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:20.655
My turn!

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:33.668
Help!

01:02:34.627 --> 01:02:35.962
Help!

01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:37.964
What happened?

01:02:38.047 --> 01:02:40.424
Was there an earthquake?

01:02:41.259 --> 01:02:42.259
Your Majesty...

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:45.554
Wait.

01:02:47.515 --> 01:02:48.557
Let me do it.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.032
What a cute little monster

01:03:06.158 --> 01:03:08.411
I've subdued it, keep it <i>as</i> a souvenir

01:03:08.494 --> 01:03:10.705
I will chant sutras day and night.

01:03:10.955 --> 01:03:12.665
Until its evil nature is defeated

01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:14.667
I'll do my best.

01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:18.838
The king...

01:03:20.756 --> 01:03:22.174
Your Majesty!

01:03:28.264 --> 01:03:29.640
Thank you, your reverences.

01:03:29.724 --> 01:03:32.018
We have our real king back at last.

01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:34.353
We've prepared lavish gifts for you.

01:03:34.437 --> 01:03:35.604
See for yourselves.

01:03:48.951 --> 01:03:51.579
The palace's 3000 beauties.

01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:53.080
Choose which you like.

01:03:53.164 --> 01:03:53.748
All for me?

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:56.709
Too few? You can have the throne too.

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:58.294
Calm down, Your Majesty.

01:03:59.128 --> 01:04:00.838
His Majesty is offering...

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:03.549
Ladies-in-waiting for your journey.

01:04:03.758 --> 01:04:04.633
So it is

01:04:04.717 --> 01:04:06.635
I'm grateful for his generosity, but I...

01:04:06.719 --> 01:04:08.599
You think we're the types
to accept such a gift?

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:10.473
Women make us seriously ill.

01:04:10.556 --> 01:04:11.474
Put me in change of them...

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:13.267
And see how badly I treat them all.

01:04:14.143 --> 01:04:15.061
Come on, the fish is getting very dry.

01:04:15.144 --> 01:04:16.270
Put that to good use.

01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:18.230
Your saliva smells bad.

01:04:18.314 --> 01:04:19.315
Don't be picky.

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:21.108
Better than nothing.

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:24.320
It's good to have someone for help.

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:25.821
- Please pick one or two - Yes.

01:04:26.155 --> 01:04:29.408
Don't fight with me,
I'll handle them one by one.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.994
If Your Majesty insists on repaying us...

01:04:32.078 --> 01:04:33.278
Maybe I can suggest something?

01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:35.706
Could you free these ladies?

01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:36.874
Sure, no problem.

01:04:36.957 --> 01:04:39.460
Anyone who wants to leave can leave.

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:42.588
No blame attached, you have my word.

01:04:43.089 --> 01:04:44.673
Your Majesty, so...

01:04:44.757 --> 01:04:45.549
I feel like crying.

01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:48.094
All those women in my harem
are ugly-looking gluttons.

01:04:48.177 --> 01:04:49.178
They eat really a lot.

01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:52.932
They eat 7 meals a day, better send them away.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.392
You can go, you're free.

01:04:54.475 --> 01:04:55.559
Are you out of your mind?

01:04:55.643 --> 01:04:56.560
Being imperial concubines is just fine.

01:04:56.644 --> 01:04:57.728
Why would we want to leave?

01:04:57.812 --> 01:04:59.897
Damned bald monk, who do you think you are?

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.620
If you stir thing up, we'll sort you out!

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:03.192
You think we're vain?

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.778
Damn you, we're here for love!

01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:07.780
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.241
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:12.743
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

01:05:12.827 --> 01:05:14.662
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

01:05:15.204 --> 01:05:17.832
See how they love you?

01:05:18.791 --> 01:05:20.668
I'll crush your balls

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.278
- I'm sorry...
- Sparing on effort!

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:25.256
Calm down, you can all stay.

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:31.053
I want to die.

01:05:37.476 --> 01:05:39.311
That one...

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:41.188
You... You...

01:05:41.272 --> 01:05:42.148
<i>- Me?
- Yes!</i>

01:05:42.231 --> 01:05:45.151
The one in black behind you.

01:05:45.234 --> 01:05:47.653
How come I've never seen you before?

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:49.447
This lady is a newcomer.

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.323
She's a songstress.

01:05:53.701 --> 01:05:55.578
What's your name?

01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:58.789
Felicity.

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.416
Since you're a songstress...

01:06:00.583 --> 01:06:02.585
Give us a quick song.

01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:04.920
To send the Masters on their way.

01:06:06.172 --> 01:06:07.298
Yes, sire.

01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:26.066
Fatso, am I afraid of you?

01:06:48.756 --> 01:06:50.799
"Yesterday, today."

01:06:50.883 --> 01:06:54.678
"The past has slipped away."

01:06:57.097 --> 01:06:59.016
"Without make-up..."

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:03.896
"...colors fade."

01:07:04.355 --> 01:07:08.192
"All through history..."

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:12.655
"...love endures."

01:07:12.738 --> 01:07:16.116
"Your love awaits your return."

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:20.120
"Wandering beyond the clouds."

01:07:22.164 --> 01:07:24.875
"Love-sickness..."

01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:27.795
"...begets sorrow."

01:07:29.838 --> 01:07:32.967
"In this world..."

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:37.596
"...fate is immutable."

01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:41.100
"Let it go."

01:07:41.684 --> 01:07:46.522
"We cannot be together"

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:53.362
"ls this truly our destiny?"

01:07:58.534 --> 01:08:01.662
Splendid! Her artistry is magnificent.

01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:14.549
Master...

01:08:15.718 --> 01:08:16.718
What is it?

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:19.596
His Majesty asks
if you'd like to have Felicity...

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680
...for your travels?

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:21.807
Out of the question!

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:24.018
I go to the west
to find sutras and cultivate myself.

01:08:24.393 --> 01:08:26.073
She couldn't make such an arduous journey.

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:29.148
I have burned incense and prayed to Buddha

01:08:29.231 --> 01:08:30.608
I am a devout Buddhist.

01:08:30.691 --> 01:08:33.109
We must brave the elements with little to eat.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:35.654
A young woman couldn't endure it

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.197
I'm not afraid.

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:39.033
My family was poor

01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:41.577
I've done household chores since I was young

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.787
I'm accustomed to hardship.

01:08:43.871 --> 01:08:44.580
Wonderful!

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.290
What touching words.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:47.957
This songstress...

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:50.919
She can sing, dance, cook and wash.

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:55.090
What a resource, at home and on travels.

01:08:55.174 --> 01:08:55.924
Still...

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:58.426
Master, you really don't want her?

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:00.386
I don't.

01:09:01.764 --> 01:09:03.182
You won't regret it?

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:04.557
No regrets.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.020
Master, please take time to reflect

01:09:08.103 --> 01:09:09.395
I'll ask you once again.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.689
You don't want her?

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.732
I don't.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.817
You must be kidding! Such a charming girl!

01:09:13.901 --> 01:09:16.737
Why don't you want her? You're weird!

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:18.113
Minister...

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:20.240
Please arrange this

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:23.993
I want the girl sent to my chambers ASAP.

01:09:26.372 --> 01:09:27.538
Your Majesty...

01:09:33.796 --> 01:09:36.090
We'll take our leave now.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.013
Attendants, see them out.

01:09:43.096 --> 01:09:44.198
Help them with the fish too.

01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:45.474
Come with me.

01:10:28.475 --> 01:10:29.643
When you've suffered pain...

01:10:30.352 --> 01:10:32.187
...you know the pain of all sentient beings.

01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:34.898
When you've insisted...

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:36.734
...you know how to let go.

01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:40.059
When you've cared for others...

01:10:41.113 --> 01:10:42.823
...you know how to move on.

01:10:44.992 --> 01:10:46.832
That's what spiritual attainment is all about.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.747
But me...

01:10:51.123 --> 01:10:52.666
I'm just an ordinary man.

01:10:56.879 --> 01:10:57.963
Your Majesty...

01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:00.215
The Master is back again.

01:11:04.136 --> 01:11:06.430
Master, you have broken your journey.

01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:08.348
What trouble did you encounter?

01:11:08.557 --> 01:11:10.184
I've been pondering

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:11.286
I don't think I should reject...

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:12.978
...Your Majesty's great generosity.

01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:16.064
Please allow Felicity to join me on my journey.

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:19.151
You can do that, right?

01:11:21.612 --> 01:11:22.529
I can, but...

01:11:22.613 --> 01:11:23.489
But what?

01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:26.575
I had my way with Felicity.

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:31.747
Tell you what... Choose someone else.

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:36.668
Master...

01:11:36.752 --> 01:11:39.087
I sympathize, but there's nothing I can do.

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:44.134
You mean... But I don't mind.

01:11:45.594 --> 01:11:47.471
Your Majesty has favored Felicity.

01:11:47.554 --> 01:11:48.865
That makes me all the more honored.

01:11:48.889 --> 01:11:50.140
You don't mind?

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:51.892
Definitely not.

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:53.435
You don't mind...

01:11:53.519 --> 01:11:55.479
But I mind.

01:11:58.732 --> 01:12:00.692
The fact of the matter is...

01:12:00.776 --> 01:12:02.778
Felicity resisted him last night.

01:12:02.861 --> 01:12:04.488
She refuses to be a concubine.

01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:07.324
She says she'd rather die than
be forced into it.

01:12:08.659 --> 01:12:09.660
Then...

01:12:09.743 --> 01:12:10.953
Yes!

01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:12.120
I lied to you.

01:12:12.204 --> 01:12:13.831
So what?

01:12:13.914 --> 01:12:16.834
Yesterday I asked you eight times...

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.377
And you refused.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:21.255
Now you come back and change your mind.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:24.341
How reckless!

01:12:24.883 --> 01:12:26.468
Don't get worked up.

01:12:26.552 --> 01:12:28.220
Put down the drum.

01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:29.721
All the women in the harem...

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:33.016
...look like they've been struck by lightning.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.519
But this one is good-looking.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:37.938
You won't grant me this one morsel?

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:38.814
That's right.

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:40.440
You bastard!

01:12:41.692 --> 01:12:43.902
Now that Master has made up his mind.

01:12:43.986 --> 01:12:45.786
And since Felicity refuses to be a concubine.

01:12:45.863 --> 01:12:48.031
Let's move towards a happy ending.

01:12:48.907 --> 01:12:49.658
Attendants.

01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:51.285
Fetch Felicity.

01:12:51.827 --> 01:12:53.328
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.163
Master.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.289
Drink some water.

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:40.918
You first.

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:42.127
Thank you.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.049
Monkey, what are you doing?

01:13:47.132 --> 01:13:48.342
Taking a leak!

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:50.552
In front of a girl? What's got into you?

01:13:50.636 --> 01:13:52.304
Go over there!

01:13:53.889 --> 01:13:55.432
- Felicity...
- Master, come with me.

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:57.476
I don't need to go.

01:13:57.559 --> 01:13:58.644
Yes, you do!

01:13:58.727 --> 01:13:59.770
Come.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.106
One moment, I'll be right back.

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:06.360
My dear...

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.153
Who are you?

01:14:08.612 --> 01:14:10.113
I'm Second Brother.

01:14:10.197 --> 01:14:12.991
Isn't my true face... Completely irresistible?

01:14:14.952 --> 01:14:15.952
Sometimes...

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:19.039
When I look in the mirror, my beauty stuns me.

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:20.456
Second Brother...

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:22.250
Brother Monkey is watching you.

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:24.086
So I can't look in the mirror.

01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:25.379
When I accidentally do...

01:14:27.589 --> 01:14:29.841
I would feel dizzy.

01:14:40.102 --> 01:14:41.520
Extreme!

01:14:41.603 --> 01:14:44.064
Mistress, go get a whip.

01:14:44.356 --> 01:14:46.274
Lash me, correct me...

01:14:46.358 --> 01:14:49.319
Insult me, beat me, punish me...

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:52.322
You're laughing at me.

01:14:55.075 --> 01:14:56.618
You're coughing, Third Brother.

01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:58.120
Drink some water.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:01.665
What's blocking your nose?

01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:18.264
That's more comfortable!

01:15:18.432 --> 01:15:21.059
So you get back human form when you sneeze.

01:15:21.143 --> 01:15:23.854
You should've said, it's hard work pulling you.

01:15:24.813 --> 01:15:26.440
Master.

01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:29.026
Try to pee just a little even
if you don't want to.

01:15:29.109 --> 01:15:30.709
Make a puddle to look at your reflection

01:15:34.448 --> 01:15:36.450
I'm handsome, does that bother you?

01:15:36.867 --> 01:15:39.369
You're not, you don't even have hair

01:15:39.995 --> 01:15:41.329
Felicity is quite good-looking.

01:15:41.413 --> 01:15:42.849
Why did she pass up being a queen...

01:15:42.873 --> 01:15:44.583
To follow you instead?

01:15:45.292 --> 01:15:46.835
What's on your mind?

01:15:47.002 --> 01:15:49.796
She's actually a demon, she plans to eat you.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:53.133
Don't do that!

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:57.596
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.265
There are many kinds of demon.

01:16:00.348 --> 01:16:01.933
Some are easy to spot.

01:16:02.017 --> 01:16:04.936
Others aren't easy at all.

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.399
So you have no proof.

01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:12.277
It's not hard to check.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.154
You've let her looks blind you.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:15.947
Get on her case.

01:16:16.198 --> 01:16:17.532
Do I have to tell you how?

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:19.534
Aren't you a professional demon-hunter?

01:16:44.059 --> 01:16:45.185
What are you looking for?

01:16:45.393 --> 01:16:46.603
A mirror.

01:16:47.104 --> 01:16:48.313
I have one.

01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:53.735
Thank you.

01:16:55.195 --> 01:16:56.988
What a shining bronze mirror!

01:17:01.576 --> 01:17:02.619
Doesn't it work?

01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:04.703
It's fine.

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:11.086
Have you finished?

01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:13.213
I'll help comb your hair.

01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:24.558
What are you doing?

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:27.060
A demon's blood will vaporize...

01:17:27.144 --> 01:17:28.436
...on the mirror.

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:31.398
That's impossible!

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:32.524
Nothing happened.

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:34.234
Shut it, demon-hunter.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:36.194
- Let's calm down.
- Where are you from?

01:17:36.278 --> 01:17:37.737
I'm from Rivermouth Village.

01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:39.072
Rivermouth Village.

01:17:39.281 --> 01:17:40.508
It's on the other side of that hill

01:17:40.532 --> 01:17:42.075
I dare you to take me there

01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:43.679
I've never known a demon with a family

01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:44.953
<i>I'll go!</i>

01:17:47.455 --> 01:17:50.125
"Rivermouth Village"

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:57.048
Felicity, it's so long since you visited us.

01:17:57.132 --> 01:18:00.302
Ma, I'm following a monk west to find sutras.

01:18:02.012 --> 01:18:03.889
See how nice her family is?

01:18:03.972 --> 01:18:05.640
You'd better apologize to them now.

01:18:06.016 --> 01:18:07.976
Apologize? Dream on!

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:17.485
Dad!

01:18:22.699 --> 01:18:25.118
Demon girl, you hired a big supporting cast.

01:18:25.202 --> 01:18:26.036
No expense spared

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:28.038
I don't know what the misunderstanding is.

01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:29.414
But please let my mother go.

01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:31.374
Spare the lives of my family.

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:34.127
Don't be rash! Let her go.

01:18:34.211 --> 01:18:35.253
Ma.

01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:37.964
Brother Monkey, Master likes this young woman.

01:18:38.048 --> 01:18:39.128
But he still loves you too.

01:18:39.507 --> 01:18:41.009
Don't be jealous.

01:18:41.593 --> 01:18:42.677
Jealous?

01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:45.430
Will you shut up?

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:50.852
Ma, Run.

01:18:52.187 --> 01:18:54.147
How many times must I tell you?

01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:55.440
This woman is really a demon.

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:56.709
They're in league to do you harm.

01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:58.173
They're a family, three generations!

01:18:58.443 --> 01:19:00.362
And you keep slandering them!

01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:02.864
You're the one doing harm.

01:19:02.948 --> 01:19:04.157
You're the demon.

01:19:04.241 --> 01:19:06.618
So you believe her rather than me?

01:19:06.826 --> 01:19:07.911
Yes.

01:19:07.994 --> 01:19:08.787
Fine.

01:19:08.995 --> 01:19:10.163
Then <i>I'll</i> kill her.

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:18.964
How dare you smite me as a demon?

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:20.757
All the women that I like.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.133
Such as Miss Duan before her.

01:19:22.217 --> 01:19:23.635
You want to kill them all?

01:19:24.386 --> 01:19:25.929
He finally said it.

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:32.227
So you haven't forgotten.

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:33.895
Of course I remember

01:19:34.062 --> 01:19:35.062
I'll always remember.

01:19:35.105 --> 01:19:37.607
The way you beat her, beat her to death!

01:19:38.483 --> 01:19:40.483
I thought you were
really treating me as a brother.

01:19:40.652 --> 01:19:41.653
Brother?

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:44.614
Since I'm stuck with
a mad killer like you, day in, day out...

01:19:44.698 --> 01:19:47.617
...I have to pretend to get along with you!

01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:49.828
If you died ten times, it wouldn't be enough

01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:52.163
I wish you'd go to hell and be damned forever

01:19:52.247 --> 01:19:53.247
I see.

01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:55.208
If you're not my friend in this world...

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:57.419
You're my enemy.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:19:59.963
We've been enemies all along.

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:01.715
Get out!

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:04.718
Go away as far as possible,
while I'm in a good mood.

01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:07.387
So you're in a good mood?

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:09.097
Listen, all of you.

01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:11.599
For all the demon I killed...

01:20:11.683 --> 01:20:12.683
...on this journey...

01:20:12.726 --> 01:20:14.269
I did it for him.

01:20:14.728 --> 01:20:16.813
My constant headaches...

01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:18.690
The lash-scars all over my body...

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:20.775
That's all his doing.

01:20:21.318 --> 01:20:22.652
Whatever I owed him...

01:20:22.736 --> 01:20:24.404
I've repaid it in full.

01:20:24.779 --> 01:20:27.615
Whatever he owes me, no need to repay.

01:20:28.116 --> 01:20:30.285
From now on, our master-disciple bond...

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:31.786
...is at an end!

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:34.748
- Brother Monkey!
- Let him go.

01:20:42.964 --> 01:20:43.964
Dad

01:21:08.615 --> 01:21:10.033
Felicity, how's your family?

01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:13.244
They're recovering, they'll be fine.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.165
Please don't blame yourself.

01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:19.292
Who's Miss Duan?

01:21:23.088 --> 01:21:25.006
Miss Duan was also a demon-hunter.

01:21:25.882 --> 01:21:28.301
We faced life or death struggles together.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.928
I loved her a lot.

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:32.764
But I dared not admit it.

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:34.432
Until the day I saw...

01:21:34.516 --> 01:21:35.892
...the way Monkey beat her.

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:37.394
Beat her to death.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.312
And then it was too late.

01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:41.773
I let her down.

01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:45.276
And if you meet someone else you like...

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.945
...will you let her down again?

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:56.538
I never wanted too much from life.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.499
Just find the right man...

01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:03.670
Get married, have a baby...

01:22:04.671 --> 01:22:06.798
Settle down

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:11.678
I've found that man...

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:13.263
It's you.

01:22:36.411 --> 01:22:37.620
Master, it's a crisis!

01:22:37.704 --> 01:22:38.621
Brother Monkey has gone mad.

01:22:38.705 --> 01:22:41.166
He killed everyone in sight,
we couldn't stop him!

01:22:52.886 --> 01:22:54.012
Pigsy, Sandy...

01:22:54.095 --> 01:22:55.305
See if anyone can be saved.

01:22:55.388 --> 01:22:57.056
Ma! Dad!

01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:09.360
Dad! Ma!

01:23:09.903 --> 01:23:12.739
You can smile after killing so many?

01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:14.407
You're possessed by the devil.

01:23:15.158 --> 01:23:17.327
Those I killed were all demons.

01:23:18.119 --> 01:23:19.496
So I won't waste words.

01:23:19.579 --> 01:23:20.899
You don't believe anything I say.

01:23:22.248 --> 01:23:23.374
<i>I'll</i> kill the last one.

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:24.667
And have done with it.

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:28.630
Don't force me.

01:23:28.713 --> 01:23:30.965
You'll give your life to protect a demon?

01:23:31.341 --> 01:23:32.634
I won't let you hurt any more...

01:23:32.717 --> 01:23:34.093
...of the people I love.

01:23:34.385 --> 01:23:36.596
You're possessed! Out of my way!

01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:40.390
That's enough!

01:23:41.643 --> 01:23:42.519
Enough?

01:23:42.602 --> 01:23:44.562
You want to die, so be my guest.

01:23:44.854 --> 01:23:47.357
"Child, Child, why..."

01:23:47.941 --> 01:23:49.817
"Child, Child..."

01:23:49.901 --> 01:23:51.986
"Why are you so bad?"

01:23:52.278 --> 01:23:54.072
I'll sing it for you.

01:23:57.242 --> 01:23:58.242
Buddha's Palm?

01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:04.415
Buddha's Palm? Still pretending!

01:24:04.499 --> 01:24:05.750
You can't do it!

01:24:09.796 --> 01:24:12.257
Don't believe me, asshole?

01:24:15.677 --> 01:24:16.803
No!

01:24:16.886 --> 01:24:18.972
Please don't strike your Master.

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:21.224
Stop, I beg you.

01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:25.436
That's very touching

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.896
I'll kill you first.

01:24:36.656 --> 01:24:38.741
Baldy, you're worth nothing.

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:42.537
Don't hit him!

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.831
I'll admit it, I'm a demon

01:24:45.957 --> 01:24:46.666
I'm a demon.

01:24:46.749 --> 01:24:49.168
My real form is a skeleton

01:24:49.335 --> 01:24:51.546
I conjured up the illusion of this village.

01:24:52.297 --> 01:24:53.756
You need to hear her say it again?

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.552
My beloved and I
were waylaid by mountain brigands.

01:24:57.802 --> 01:25:00.930
My love abandoned me and fled

01:25:01.014 --> 01:25:02.015
I was horribly abused.

01:25:04.851 --> 01:25:07.729
The brigands raped me and left me to die.

01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:11.524
I turned into a heap of bones.

01:25:11.608 --> 01:25:14.068
But my grievances have never died.

01:25:19.741 --> 01:25:22.201
In truth, I'm nothing but bones

01:25:24.037 --> 01:25:25.246
I'm sorry.

01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:11.747
Heavens! Master is dead!
We can forget those sutras!

01:26:11.793 --> 01:26:13.127
Hurray!

01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:43.866
Case closed!

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.077
Minister, you're so great!

01:26:47.954 --> 01:26:49.997
You had provoked Monkey's demonic nature.

01:26:50.081 --> 01:26:51.791
He's even gobbled up his Master.

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:56.045
See how Buddha rages in the western sky.

01:26:56.129 --> 01:26:57.338
Shut up!

01:26:59.757 --> 01:27:02.260
I have a dream.

01:27:02.677 --> 01:27:03.594
I want all the world's liars

01:27:03.678 --> 01:27:05.763
and monsters to show...

01:27:05.847 --> 01:27:07.515
...their true colors

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:10.518
Felicity, no need to hide.

01:27:10.601 --> 01:27:12.520
Come on, show yourself.

01:27:12.812 --> 01:27:14.647
Your stratagem of sowing discord was smart.

01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:17.859
I know you have true feelings for the monk.

01:27:17.942 --> 01:27:19.944
You're following your heart.

01:27:20.528 --> 01:27:24.282
My very own path to supreme wisdom.

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.995
So this is the legendary Monkey King?

01:27:29.579 --> 01:27:31.164
So cute!

01:27:31.247 --> 01:27:33.666
Like a banana?

01:27:41.466 --> 01:27:44.427
Fine, we can adopt him as our pet.

01:27:45.094 --> 01:27:45.970
Why not!

01:27:46.053 --> 01:27:46.846
Six hands

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:50.141
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

01:27:52.727 --> 01:27:54.228
My turn!

01:28:08.367 --> 01:28:10.161
King of demons?

01:28:10.495 --> 01:28:12.288
All I did was cough.

01:28:12.371 --> 01:28:14.248
And you were terrified

01:28:16.584 --> 01:28:17.627
I'm your new Master.

01:28:18.503 --> 01:28:20.087
You'd better obey me.

01:28:20.171 --> 01:28:21.923
Or you'll be spanked.

01:28:49.659 --> 01:28:51.577
So you're finally revealing your foxtail.

01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:53.161
My tail?

01:28:53.204 --> 01:28:54.997
No, I keep it well hidden.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.166
Monk...

01:28:57.542 --> 01:28:59.794
You're the one who stands exposed.

01:28:59.877 --> 01:29:01.963
All that canoodling with skeleton-demon here...

01:29:02.630 --> 01:29:04.006
Worldly desires are back?

01:29:04.215 --> 01:29:06.175
Felicity hasn't lost her virtues

01:29:06.259 --> 01:29:08.970
I'll make it possible for her to reincarnate.

01:29:09.428 --> 01:29:10.748
Your stratagem is to sow discord.

01:29:10.847 --> 01:29:12.765
But we have a counter-stratagem.

01:29:12.932 --> 01:29:16.435
You thought we were fooled by Felicity.

01:29:16.519 --> 01:29:17.579
You thought she could sow discord...

01:29:17.603 --> 01:29:19.605
...between Monkey and me.

01:29:19.939 --> 01:29:22.608
But you underestimated Monkey's vision.

01:29:22.692 --> 01:29:25.403
The skeleton-demon conjured up the village.

01:29:25.486 --> 01:29:26.654
We knew it at the beginning.

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.491
And we pretended to be fooled by it,
<i>as</i> you hoped.

01:29:30.575 --> 01:29:32.785
We tricked you into revealing yourself.

01:29:32.869 --> 01:29:33.494
Minister...

01:29:33.578 --> 01:29:35.288
I'll tell you one more thing

01:29:35.746 --> 01:29:37.623
I'm actually very wise!

01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:45.548
Wise?

01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:48.050
Comfort yourself with your illusions.

01:29:49.677 --> 01:29:52.346
Let's see what you can do to me.

01:29:54.599 --> 01:29:55.725
Strike!

01:29:56.434 --> 01:29:57.810
All right!

01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:46.275
Master, grasp my tail

01:30:50.488 --> 01:30:51.572
Felicity!

01:30:51.656 --> 01:30:53.532
Take care! Stay clear!

01:30:56.285 --> 01:30:58.621
I'm the Monkey King!

01:30:58.955 --> 01:31:00.998
Demon, you cannot flee!

01:31:07.463 --> 01:31:10.257
Bad monkey, he's such a stupid monk.

01:31:10.341 --> 01:31:12.051
Is it worth dying for him?

01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:14.345
Master, she knows you too well.

01:31:14.428 --> 01:31:15.805
She says you're stupid.

01:31:15.972 --> 01:31:18.349
Don't listen to her, I'm very wise.

01:31:19.183 --> 01:31:20.351
See my moves.

01:31:20.893 --> 01:31:21.978
Ward me off?

01:31:22.436 --> 01:31:23.604
You think you can?

01:31:29.694 --> 01:31:30.903
Monkey...

01:31:31.112 --> 01:31:32.655
Your nemesis is here!

01:31:51.799 --> 01:31:53.050
Buddha!

01:31:53.342 --> 01:31:56.303
Even Buddha is invited! Giving you real face!

01:32:08.524 --> 01:32:09.734
It's not possible.

01:32:09.942 --> 01:32:11.152
It's an imposter.

01:32:11.235 --> 01:32:14.030
Yep, looks like he's had a nose and chin job.

01:32:14.113 --> 01:32:15.614
Monkey...

01:32:16.198 --> 01:32:18.492
You've felt Buddha's power.

01:32:18.617 --> 01:32:20.286
Come closer for the full effect!

01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:25.458
Fine, try my Anchoring Pole.

01:32:35.426 --> 01:32:38.471
No wave-swell can match the East Sea itself!

01:33:04.246 --> 01:33:06.624
Master, shelter in my ear-lobe.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:52.545
Two Buddhas!

01:34:27.163 --> 01:34:28.789
Monkey, Monkey...

01:35:52.873 --> 01:35:55.000
Immortal gold vulture.

01:35:55.084 --> 01:35:57.503
You have cultivated yourself beside me.

01:35:58.545 --> 01:36:00.756
Yet you do not understand.

01:36:01.507 --> 01:36:05.261
No wonder you spread sophistry in the world.

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.013
Lord Buddha

01:36:08.097 --> 01:36:09.848
I live for you

01:36:09.932 --> 01:36:12.893
I've been by your side for so many years.

01:36:13.394 --> 01:36:15.521
But did you ever notice me?

01:36:15.771 --> 01:36:17.022
Say no more.

01:36:18.357 --> 01:36:21.318
Immortal gold vulture, show your true self.

01:37:01.066 --> 01:37:02.484
Try to stand, Felicity.

01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:04.621
I will try to exorcise your demonic traits.

01:37:06.322 --> 01:37:07.906
There's too much demon in me.

01:37:08.157 --> 01:37:09.742
Even if you save me...

01:37:10.034 --> 01:37:12.202
I can't be sure I won't harm humans again.

01:37:12.703 --> 01:37:14.038
You conquer demons.

01:37:14.538 --> 01:37:15.914
And I am a demon.

01:37:16.332 --> 01:37:17.916
Free my soul.

01:37:20.961 --> 01:37:22.046
She's right.

01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:25.632
Her acrimony runs too deep, she has to burn

01:37:28.177 --> 01:37:29.470
Felicity...

01:37:30.262 --> 01:37:33.974
The greatest obstacle in the world is love.

01:37:36.769 --> 01:37:40.314
She... is always here in your heart.

01:37:40.397 --> 01:37:42.232
She fills it.

01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:43.901
If only...

01:37:44.818 --> 01:37:48.822
I could... Remain as a trace in your memories...

01:37:48.906 --> 01:37:50.240
I'll be content.

01:37:55.412 --> 01:37:56.747
Don't look at me.

01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:58.665
Clean up your own mess

01:37:58.749 --> 01:38:01.126
I don't want you saying I've killed your girl.

01:38:01.877 --> 01:38:03.087
Let's go.

01:38:07.716 --> 01:38:09.093
The truth is...

01:38:09.426 --> 01:38:11.553
I really have fallen for you.

01:38:13.013 --> 01:38:15.224
Do you like me at least a tiny bit?

01:38:18.435 --> 01:38:19.603
Sorry...

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.397
My heart...

01:38:22.022 --> 01:38:23.899
...has no space for anyone else

01:38:25.567 --> 01:38:27.361
I'm so silly, aren't I?

01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:29.905
I knew that.

01:38:30.155 --> 01:38:31.407
But I still asked

01:38:35.994 --> 01:38:37.204
Felicity...

01:38:39.581 --> 01:38:41.125
I'm going to send you on your way.

01:39:37.473 --> 01:39:39.475
Master, we should talk...

01:39:39.558 --> 01:39:42.144
Did you ever have feelings for Felicity?

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.814
I'm asking you...

01:39:46.231 --> 01:39:48.650
Did you ever have feelings for Felicity?

01:39:50.486 --> 01:39:51.612
Of course not!

01:39:51.695 --> 01:39:53.280
You're the only one in my heart.

01:39:53.655 --> 01:39:54.781
Only me?

01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.866
Brother Monkey...

01:39:55.949 --> 01:39:58.327
Your headband was once Miss Duan's.

01:39:58.410 --> 01:39:59.596
The memory of her still haunts Master.

01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:01.246
So he sometimes takes you for her.

01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:03.499
You can see it in his smile, look!

01:40:04.124 --> 01:40:05.417
Impossible!

01:40:08.045 --> 01:40:09.671
Really?

01:40:11.006 --> 01:40:13.175
You don't trust even me?

01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:20.390
So did she ever touch your heart?

01:40:21.141 --> 01:40:24.061
Of course not, it's a meaningless question.

01:40:24.144 --> 01:40:25.687
Did you really think I'd say yes?

01:40:25.771 --> 01:40:27.290
You women always ask the same question.

01:40:27.314 --> 01:40:29.483
So you did, you lowlife!

01:40:29.733 --> 01:40:30.817
Lowlife!

01:40:39.117 --> 01:40:41.095
This can't go on,
I'd better get back the headband.

01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:42.579
Or she'll ask again.

01:40:43.956 --> 01:40:45.207
What are you doing?

01:40:45.582 --> 01:40:46.667
Give back the headband.

01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:48.627
Are you crazy? You gave it to me.

01:40:48.710 --> 01:40:51.004
It doesn't suit you, it makes you look awful.

01:40:51.088 --> 01:40:52.982
You should have said so before, you can have it.

01:40:53.006 --> 01:40:54.550
Hand it over! Why are you running off?

01:40:54.633 --> 01:40:56.611
I said I will give back to you
and you don't trust me?

01:40:56.635 --> 01:40:58.303
Stop talking, give back to me

01:40:58.387 --> 01:40:59.263
I've given it to you.

01:40:59.346 --> 01:41:01.265
No, you just said you would.

01:41:01.348 --> 01:41:02.766
Right, I said I would.

01:41:02.849 --> 01:41:05.269
You said you would, but you haven't done so.

01:41:05.352 --> 01:41:06.853
Haven't I? Are you sure?

01:41:06.937 --> 01:41:08.564
I'm sure! Believe me for once!

01:41:08.647 --> 01:41:09.647
I don't.

01:47:57.889 --> 01:47:58.723
Let's go.

01:47:58.807 --> 01:48:00.727
Hang on, there's probably more
after the credits.

01:48:00.767 --> 01:48:02.769
No need to wait, there's no post-credits scene.

01:48:02.852 --> 01:48:04.497
Please be sure to take all your belongings.

01:48:04.521 --> 01:48:06.606
Exit on the right side, thank you.

01:48:07.107 --> 01:48:09.484
Hey, blockbusters always have
a post-credits scene!

01:48:09.567 --> 01:48:11.194
This isn't a blockbuster.

01:48:11.277 --> 01:48:12.779
So there isn't one.

01:48:14.239 --> 01:48:15.532
I repeat.

01:48:15.615 --> 01:48:16.992
It's not a blockbuster.

01:48:17.283 --> 01:48:18.702
So there isn't one.

01:48:19.536 --> 01:48:21.121
If this were a blockbuster.

01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:23.123
There'd be one
