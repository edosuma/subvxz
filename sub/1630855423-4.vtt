WEBVTT

00:07.844 --> 00:09.513
Midnight to 6:00 in the morning.

00:09.596 --> 00:14.810
Well, I was shocked, shocked!
You said yes to breakfast.

00:14.893 --> 00:16.353
Oh, yeah. I'm like a supermodel.

00:16.978 --> 00:19.648
"I never get outta bed
for less than $10,000,"

00:19.731 --> 00:20.857
or Carrie Bradshaw.

00:20.941 --> 00:23.110
-One or the other.
-Aw, shucks.

00:23.193 --> 00:26.196
Well, anyway, I wanted to keep a promise

00:26.279 --> 00:29.282
that you probably don't
even remember me making.

00:30.867 --> 00:32.994
Dude, did you dedicate your book to me?

00:33.703 --> 00:36.373
No, Jackie, I did not.

00:37.165 --> 00:41.545
But you said you wanted
a personally signed copy when it came out.

00:41.628 --> 00:43.046
-There you are.
-Thanks.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.382
This is gonna make me look hella smart
on the subway.

00:45.465 --> 00:46.967
Well, I don't know.

00:47.926 --> 00:48.844
No.

00:48.927 --> 00:52.013
I just broke my no-Hollandaise-
before-noon rule.

00:52.097 --> 00:52.931
Fuck!

00:53.682 --> 00:55.267
Sorry, excuse me.

00:56.560 --> 00:57.477
Godspeed.

01:18.331 --> 01:19.499
Enid. Hi!

01:19.583 --> 01:22.711
-Carrie. Hello.
-Yeah.

01:22.794 --> 01:25.088
I thought I recognized your highlights

01:25.172 --> 01:30.677
and fairly certain it was your shade,
but I couldn't bring myself to say hello.

01:31.261 --> 01:33.221
-Why not?
-Well, I felt terrible

01:33.305 --> 01:34.973
about what happened to your husband.

01:35.056 --> 01:39.436
And then I was mortified
that I hadn't written a condolence card--

01:39.519 --> 01:40.479
That's okay. It's okay.

01:40.562 --> 01:44.733
The truth is, I had my own death.
I'm sure you heard.

01:44.816 --> 01:46.860
My God, no. Who did you lose?

01:46.943 --> 01:49.988
Me. After 34 years at "Vogue,"

01:50.072 --> 01:52.741
and then six years before that
at "Mademoiselle,"

01:52.824 --> 01:54.409
may she rest in peace.

01:54.493 --> 01:59.414
Condé Nast gave me the golden parachute,
if you can believe it. Me.

01:59.498 --> 02:01.124
No, honestly, I can't.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.542
But if it helps to hear,

02:02.626 --> 02:06.088
I'm really enjoying
your "Ask Enid" newsletter.

02:06.171 --> 02:09.091
I mean, you must know it's wildly popular.

02:09.174 --> 02:11.259
Yeah, it is. It's rivaling "Goop."

02:12.719 --> 02:14.721
What are you reading? Something wonderful?

02:14.805 --> 02:18.350
Oh, well, I hope so.
It's my new book.

02:19.101 --> 02:21.520
Actually, I had sent you an email.

02:21.603 --> 02:25.023
I don't-- It was a while ago.
I don't know if you got it.

02:25.107 --> 02:26.274
No.

02:27.526 --> 02:28.568
Yes.

02:28.652 --> 02:31.071
You wanted me to blurb your book.

02:31.154 --> 02:33.240
Congratulations, by the way.

02:33.323 --> 02:36.410
Well, obviously,
the blurb ship has sailed,

02:36.493 --> 02:37.327
but...

02:40.080 --> 02:44.584
if you ever felt inclined, you know,
to mention the book

02:44.668 --> 02:46.420
in "Ask Enid,"

02:46.503 --> 02:49.756
I don't have to tell you
how tough publishing is these days.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.509
You know, Carrie,
if I mentioned your book,

02:52.592 --> 02:56.221
I would have to mention
everyone's book and then--

02:56.304 --> 02:59.474
Oh. Does everyone have a book?

02:59.558 --> 03:00.809
Well, I don't.

03:01.935 --> 03:05.063
Mostly to avoid embarrassing situations
like this.

03:05.147 --> 03:07.899
But, listen, I'm having a thought.

03:07.983 --> 03:09.484
I like it already.

03:11.737 --> 03:16.700
I'm launching an online magazine
called "Vivante!"

03:17.701 --> 03:19.411
That's French for "alive."

03:19.494 --> 03:23.457
-Yes, yes, of course, of course.
-It's focused on women our age.

03:23.540 --> 03:27.878
Women our age are grossly
underrepresented in the media,

03:27.961 --> 03:29.963
so I'd love it if you could get involved.

03:30.046 --> 03:31.214
You're perfect for it.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.343
Oh, my gosh. Well, thank you.
Thank you.

03:36.136 --> 03:37.137
Excuse me.

03:37.220 --> 03:40.515
This is my new beau.
He's really something.

03:40.599 --> 03:43.685
I'll send you the "Vivante!" info.

03:43.769 --> 03:45.979
-Okay.
-Hey, handsome.

03:46.897 --> 03:49.816
Tippleton Lake Camp! Final boarding!

03:49.900 --> 03:51.651
Okay, this is it.

03:51.735 --> 03:54.071
Baby, I'm gonna miss you so much!

03:54.154 --> 03:55.530
It's only four weeks, Mom.

03:55.614 --> 03:56.907
I will see you visiting day.

03:56.990 --> 03:58.492
-Lily!
-Leila! Love you guys!

03:58.575 --> 03:59.826
-Bye.
-Sweetheart, love you!

03:59.910 --> 04:02.454
Summer fun is boarding now!

04:02.537 --> 04:04.122
I love you, I love you,
I love you, baby girl!

04:04.206 --> 04:05.040
Bye, you guys!

04:05.123 --> 04:06.541
Did you remember to pack my retainer?

04:06.625 --> 04:08.794
I am 95% sure.

04:08.877 --> 04:10.629
-Hi!
-That leaves a 5% window of error.

04:10.712 --> 04:12.589
I don't like those odds.

04:12.672 --> 04:14.466
-Bye!
-Be good. Bye, baby.

04:14.549 --> 04:17.302
-Did you pack your deodorant?
-Yeah, yeah. 95% sure.

04:18.970 --> 04:21.181
What are you guys gonna do
with all your kid-free time?

04:22.390 --> 04:23.225
Work.

04:23.308 --> 04:24.309
Kinky.

04:24.810 --> 04:26.561
No kids, no interruptions.

04:26.645 --> 04:27.938
And now that my film is in Tribeca,

04:28.021 --> 04:30.399
I have a zillion polishes and clearances

04:30.482 --> 04:33.151
that I can do without any guilt.

04:33.235 --> 04:37.072
I've got a huge backlog of pro-bono things
I wanna dive into.

04:37.155 --> 04:39.032
-You two?
-Yeah,

04:39.116 --> 04:41.952
Things we're behind on, too.

04:51.795 --> 04:54.881
-Okay! Bye, guys!
-All right, bye!

04:55.590 --> 04:57.592
-Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
-Okay, okay, okay!

04:57.676 --> 04:59.428
They are definitely gettin' it on.

04:59.511 --> 05:01.430
I don't think I've ever seen Harry run.

05:01.513 --> 05:03.432
Don't forget our 20th anniversary party!

05:03.515 --> 05:05.475
-Okay!
-Okay, okay. Go, go, go.

05:05.559 --> 05:08.812
So, I've invited my dad to the party.

05:10.021 --> 05:12.357
Your father and my mother
in the same room?

05:12.441 --> 05:14.401
Have you learned nothing
from Gabby's baptism?

05:14.484 --> 05:17.446
Don't get upset. The kids are gone.

05:44.848 --> 05:47.058
-Good morning!
-Morning.

05:52.814 --> 05:56.068
Good morning, honey.
We have to be there at 1:00.

05:57.611 --> 05:59.154
Do those headphones work?

05:59.237 --> 06:02.032
Obviously not if I can hear you.

06:02.115 --> 06:03.075
Right.

06:09.581 --> 06:11.583
We're due at therapy at 1:00!

06:17.047 --> 06:19.049
Oh, fuck.

06:35.107 --> 06:36.942
Hey, do I present

06:37.025 --> 06:39.611
-as a 75-year-old retiree?
-There you are.

06:39.694 --> 06:43.657
-Be honest.
-Why on earth would you ask that?

06:43.740 --> 06:48.703
Well, my former boss and mentor,
who is in her 70s,

06:48.787 --> 06:53.583
alluded to us being the same age

06:53.667 --> 06:58.880
not once, not twice, but thrice
the other day when I ran into her.

06:58.964 --> 07:01.591
-I counted.
-She wishes you were in her group.

07:01.675 --> 07:04.928
You're not. You're in my group.
We're sophomores, not seniors.

07:05.011 --> 07:07.139
Just stop using the word "thrice."

07:07.222 --> 07:10.475
Don't get me wrong, the woman's amazing,
but now she wants me to write for her

07:10.559 --> 07:12.936
online magazine, "Vivante!"

07:14.062 --> 07:17.315
If you need a magazine to remind yourself
that you're alive

07:17.399 --> 07:18.650
you've got bigger problems.

07:18.734 --> 07:20.110
Well, now I've got a bigger problem

07:20.193 --> 07:23.029
'cause she invited me
to attend her start-up.

07:23.864 --> 07:27.284
God bless, but a retirement magazine?

07:27.701 --> 07:29.870
-I'm not there yet.
-Well, I'll never be there.

07:29.953 --> 07:32.456
Trust me,
I'll be pushing penthouses from the grave.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.791
I just started the second book
of a three-book deal.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.418
I still have friends that call me "dude."

07:36.501 --> 07:38.253
Exactly. Just ignore her, dude.

07:38.336 --> 07:41.423
Who is this sad, desperate woman anyway?

07:41.506 --> 07:43.925
She was my editor at "Vogue." Enid Frick.

07:44.509 --> 07:48.638
Okay, we have to start this
whole conversation over.

07:48.722 --> 07:52.267
The woman's a legend.
Do you subscribe to "Ask Enid"?

07:52.350 --> 07:54.227
I will literally buy anything
she recommends.

07:54.311 --> 07:57.981
Yes, exactly, which is why I shamelessly
asked her to plug my book.

07:58.065 --> 08:00.233
Brilliant move.
They'll fly off the shelves.

08:00.317 --> 08:01.526
No, no, no, no. She said no.

08:01.610 --> 08:04.071
If she plugs my book,
she has to plug everyone's book.

08:04.154 --> 08:05.614
"No" is the opening offer.

08:05.697 --> 08:07.741
Everything's a negotiation.
In my business, it's,

08:07.824 --> 08:09.993
"Throw in the custom loveseat,
it's a yes."

08:10.077 --> 08:12.537
In yours, it's,
"I came to your old lady start-up

08:12.621 --> 08:15.248
and you plug my book in 'Ask Enid.'"

08:15.791 --> 08:16.750
Can I do that?

08:16.833 --> 08:20.337
You have to go to that
old lady event and work it.

08:23.465 --> 08:25.967
Another text from this guy?

08:27.427 --> 08:29.471
That's a beauty. The car, not the man.

08:29.554 --> 08:33.183
"Wrong number." What is happening?

08:33.266 --> 08:36.353
Was my life recently hacked by the AARP?

08:38.814 --> 08:42.901
Not wrong number.
"Carrie Bradshaw? Marlon Shaffer.

08:42.984 --> 08:45.445
A little birdie gave me your number."

08:45.529 --> 08:48.573
-Who's the "little birdie"?
-Who's Marlon Shaffer?

08:48.657 --> 08:52.452
And where does he buy his yellow sweater?

08:53.620 --> 08:54.913
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:54.996 --> 08:56.498
-Oh yeah.
-Like that.

08:56.581 --> 08:57.916
-Yeah, just like that.
-You are so fuckin' hot.

08:57.999 --> 09:00.085
You are so fuckin' hot.

09:00.168 --> 09:02.295
-I'm close, baby.
-Harry, Harry,

09:02.379 --> 09:03.839
do you wanna come on my tits?

09:03.922 --> 09:04.840
It's not even my birthday.

09:04.923 --> 09:05.841
-That's a birthday thing.
-Oh, God!

09:05.924 --> 09:08.885
I know, but it's like birthday
and Hanukkah and Christmas

09:08.969 --> 09:11.346
all rolled into one. Let's do it!

09:11.430 --> 09:13.974
Okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:22.899 --> 09:26.319
We still got it, babe. We still got it.

09:27.362 --> 09:28.780
Do we?

09:31.366 --> 09:32.784
Harry,

09:32.868 --> 09:35.328
did you just fake an orgasm?

09:35.412 --> 09:37.038
What? No.

09:37.622 --> 09:39.249
Why do you think--

09:40.542 --> 09:41.460
Where is it?

09:42.586 --> 09:45.213
And then, there was nothing there.

09:45.297 --> 09:46.506
And according to Harry,

09:46.590 --> 09:52.053
the orgasm was very present
and powerful, just invisible.

09:52.471 --> 09:53.889
So, it's Casper the Friendly Cum?

09:53.972 --> 09:55.432
Oh, my God!

09:55.515 --> 09:56.933
Don't you dare call him that.

09:57.017 --> 09:58.935
Why're you lookin' at me?
She's the potty mouth.

09:59.019 --> 10:02.939
Excuse me,
can I ask how you made this discovery?

10:03.023 --> 10:05.358
Well, normally, he would come inside me.

10:06.068 --> 10:08.445
This was just a special treat
since the kids are away.

10:09.112 --> 10:12.532
So, who knows how long it's been going on.

10:12.616 --> 10:15.243
And this is a problem why?

10:15.327 --> 10:18.205
I mean,
I haven't been with a man in a while,

10:18.288 --> 10:20.457
but jizz-free sex sounds like an upgrade.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.292
Guess that should've been
our first clue about you.

10:23.460 --> 10:26.797
Why, do you enjoy it?
I've never given it any thought,

10:26.880 --> 10:32.594
literally until this moment,
but to me jizz...

10:33.345 --> 10:34.763
jizz...

10:35.222 --> 10:36.640
jizz...

10:37.808 --> 10:41.603
jizz is like an old friend
that gets on your nerves.

10:41.686 --> 10:44.147
You know?
I think I'd miss it if it were gone.

10:44.231 --> 10:45.732
Aw. That's sweet.

10:45.816 --> 10:48.485
Anthony,
as the sole ejaculator in the group,

10:48.568 --> 10:50.987
can you shed any light on this
particular phenomenon?

10:51.071 --> 10:52.697
Thank you, Rachel Maddow.

10:52.781 --> 10:55.409
I believe the clinical term
is "Dust-Balls."

10:56.076 --> 10:58.286
I have no personal experience with this,

10:58.370 --> 11:00.288
either as a cum-er or cum-ee.

11:00.372 --> 11:02.749
I'm like a milking machine,
if you must know.

11:02.833 --> 11:03.917
-'Scuse me.
-Yes, sir?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.210
-Little mayo, please?
-Right away.

11:05.293 --> 11:07.254
See? I've never been a fan
of mayo, either.

11:07.337 --> 11:08.422
Another clue.

11:08.505 --> 11:11.550
Well, I've always been a fan of mayo.

11:11.633 --> 11:14.719
It's like the confetti at a parade.

11:14.803 --> 11:18.723
It's like the finale of fireworks
on the 4th of July.

11:18.807 --> 11:20.308
I love you so much right now.

11:20.392 --> 11:22.811
Me too. Who knew you were a cum-slut?

11:22.894 --> 11:24.521
Hey, don't cum-slut-shame her.

11:25.021 --> 11:26.732
That is gonna be your new name
in my phone, though.

11:27.607 --> 11:28.692
Okay.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.777
And the children, just in time.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.779
It is 10 o'clock.

11:32.863 --> 11:34.239
-Yeah.
-We are not begging

11:34.322 --> 11:37.200
one of our children to go to bed,
we are at The Mark,

11:37.284 --> 11:41.204
we are having a nightcap
after a long day's work.

11:41.288 --> 11:44.124
Do you realize that we are having
an actual conversation

11:44.207 --> 11:45.792
without interruptions?

11:45.876 --> 11:48.879
We are listening to each other
and getting things done.

11:48.962 --> 11:51.715
What can't we do with the kids away.

11:54.593 --> 11:58.430
After FedEx-ing Gabby's retainer,
I walked by the Mark Kasabian Gallery

11:58.513 --> 11:59.973
and realized I wanted him
to come to the party

12:00.056 --> 12:01.224
so I invited him, he's coming.

12:01.308 --> 12:03.101
-Is that okay?
-Of course, it is.

12:03.185 --> 12:06.146
-You know why?
-Because the kids are away!

12:06.980 --> 12:09.191
And thank you for handling
the party invitations.

12:09.274 --> 12:12.319
I was happy to take it off your plate.
Your hands are more than full now.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.448
In fact, you know that run

12:16.531 --> 12:18.617
I've been mullin' over
for City Comptroller?

12:18.700 --> 12:20.077
You mean threatening?

12:20.160 --> 12:23.163
Well, this morning,
when I was workin' out,

12:23.705 --> 12:25.707
I decided on a bit of a re-think.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.543
I think it would be too much,
especially now.

12:28.627 --> 12:29.586
Are you sure?

12:29.669 --> 12:32.339
I know how much
you wanna do for this city.

12:32.422 --> 12:33.507
Yeah, I do.

12:33.590 --> 12:36.718
But there'll be time for that
when the kids are older, but not now.

12:36.802 --> 12:41.932
And we both know with my campaigning,
it would all fall on you,

12:42.015 --> 12:44.142
and I think that would be unfair.

12:44.226 --> 12:47.854
I love "no kids" us so much.

12:47.938 --> 12:48.814
Mm-hmm.

12:50.273 --> 12:52.567
Shall I order two more espresso martinis?

12:52.651 --> 12:55.862
So that we can be wide awake
to go home and--

12:55.946 --> 12:57.322
-Work more?
-Yeah.

12:57.406 --> 12:58.365
Yeah.

13:00.117 --> 13:03.370
-Nothing to worry about.
-Good. Good!

13:03.829 --> 13:07.416
Excuse me about the power bar.
Busy day, low blood sugar.

13:09.292 --> 13:12.337
You just had a "dry orgasm,"
or retrograde ejaculation.

13:13.004 --> 13:15.424
Your semen went into your bladder
instead of your penis.

13:16.007 --> 13:20.720
-Why would it do that?
-Dr. Chang, once this starts happening,

13:20.804 --> 13:23.223
is there any way to--

13:25.016 --> 13:26.977
-Redirect traffic?
-Yes!

13:27.060 --> 13:30.731
Sure. Right now,
your muscles are not well-coordinated

13:30.814 --> 13:32.149
with your pelvic floor.

13:32.232 --> 13:34.609
-I have one of those?
-You sure do.

13:34.693 --> 13:35.819
Ever heard of Kegels?

13:36.361 --> 13:38.822
Heard of it? It's all I eat during
the High Holidays.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.908
Honey, not kugel. Kegels.

13:41.992 --> 13:44.578
They're exercises to strengthen
the muscles down there.

13:44.661 --> 13:48.206
I'm an expert. I can teach you.
It'll be fun.

13:48.290 --> 13:49.833
I bet not as fun as kugel.

13:49.916 --> 13:54.463
Okay, we're gonna lift
and squeeze the sphincter.

13:54.546 --> 13:56.631
But remember, it's not your butthole.

13:56.715 --> 13:58.300
You are not trying to hold in a fart.

13:58.383 --> 13:59.301
‘Cause I already know how to do that.

13:59.384 --> 14:01.720
Yes. So, remember what he said,

14:01.803 --> 14:04.473
"Think of your penis
like an elephant's trunk,

14:04.556 --> 14:07.267
slurping from the river."

14:07.350 --> 14:10.520
-Okay, slurp it up!
-Oh, baby.

14:10.604 --> 14:15.067
-Come on now, slurp! Let's see it.
-Yes, ma'am. Slurp.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.363
-Slurp.
-You call that a slurp?

14:20.447 --> 14:22.240
Give me your hand, feel mine.

14:22.324 --> 14:23.784
Miss, we hardly know each other.

14:23.867 --> 14:26.703
Harry, get serious.
Do ya ever wanna come again or not?

14:26.787 --> 14:28.455
I do. I wanna shoot all over you.

14:28.538 --> 14:30.332
Okay then, let's do this.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.959
Are you freakin' kiddin' me?

14:33.043 --> 14:35.837
-It's like a steel trap down there.
-You are welcome.

14:35.921 --> 14:41.718
I do three sets of 10, three times a day,
so you can suck it up.

14:41.802 --> 14:45.430
Now, come on. Two, three, four.

14:45.514 --> 14:49.351
Slurp that sperm from the pelvic floor.

14:49.434 --> 14:51.937
-The rhyming helps.
-Good, good, good! Come on!

14:53.605 --> 14:55.565
So, who would like--

14:55.649 --> 14:58.151
-Okay, I'll start.
-Great, Brady.

14:58.235 --> 14:59.986
Yeah, so it's been three weeks.

15:00.070 --> 15:01.822
I'm pretty much done
talking about my breakup.

15:01.905 --> 15:04.241
-Like, I'm good with all that.
-I agree, buddy.

15:04.324 --> 15:05.617
You're a champ, you know?

15:05.700 --> 15:07.661
So, is there anything else
that we should be, you know,

15:07.744 --> 15:10.747
-doing or thinking about?
-Yeah, your breakup.

15:10.831 --> 15:14.376
Luisa's gone, fuckin' whatever.
What about you two?

15:15.335 --> 15:17.170
-What about us?
-Mom, come on.

15:17.254 --> 15:18.713
Do you think I'm an idiot or something?

15:18.797 --> 15:21.091
Hey! Nobody's saying you're an idiot.

15:21.174 --> 15:25.804
Me and your Mom are keeping our stuff
separate, that's all.

15:25.887 --> 15:28.181
You installed a punching bag
in your bedroom.

15:28.265 --> 15:30.267
And Mom's fuckin' banished herself
to the couch,

15:30.350 --> 15:31.518
pretending she's fine with it.

15:31.601 --> 15:34.229
I am fine with it, for now.

15:34.312 --> 15:37.482
Right, yeah, well, I'm not.

15:37.566 --> 15:39.568
Are you two separating or what?

15:39.651 --> 15:43.155
Your mom and I, you know,
can talk about this privately.

15:43.238 --> 15:44.614
We don't wanna drag you in--

15:44.698 --> 15:46.283
I'm right here in the middle of it.

15:46.366 --> 15:47.826
You're up there like "Raging Bull."

15:47.909 --> 15:50.495
I can barely sleep,
and I'm heavily medicated.

15:50.579 --> 15:52.789
You are not heavily medicated.

15:52.873 --> 15:54.708
Okay, then give me more.

15:54.791 --> 15:57.252
Okay, what I'm hearing is

15:57.335 --> 16:00.630
there's a lot of underlying
tension in the house.

16:00.714 --> 16:04.009
This is a good time to look at the family
dynamic as a whole.

16:04.092 --> 16:08.096
I mean, what can I say?
You know, it is what it is.

16:09.848 --> 16:11.475
Nothing. Mom?

16:12.017 --> 16:13.018
Mom?

16:13.602 --> 16:16.438
-This is not who she is, just so you know.
-Miranda?

16:17.939 --> 16:19.983
We both wanna be home for Brady.

16:20.067 --> 16:21.902
Yeah, well, it's not helping.

16:22.527 --> 16:25.030
I think it might be
in everyone's best interest

16:25.113 --> 16:28.366
to find a more permanent solution.

16:28.450 --> 16:31.453
-We're looking for consistency.
-Okay.

16:33.455 --> 16:36.500
Then I guess I should find a place.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.711
No, I'll find a place, you know,
closer to Scout.

16:39.795 --> 16:41.546
That's my bar.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.340
Oh, well

16:44.883 --> 16:46.093
thank you.

16:47.052 --> 16:49.679
Well, Brady,
is there anything else on your mind?

16:51.014 --> 16:52.057
It's kind of off-topic,

16:52.140 --> 16:54.351
but I'm not gonna
start college in the fall.

16:55.143 --> 16:58.063
That's okay, Buddy. Whatever you need.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.734
Mom, we can all see
that your head is about to explode,

17:02.818 --> 17:04.277
so why don't you just say it?

17:04.361 --> 17:05.779
No.

17:07.072 --> 17:08.782
I have nothing to say.

17:08.865 --> 17:12.577
I have so much to say.
I don't even know where to start.

17:12.661 --> 17:14.830
This is Brady.
This is not a kid who self-motivates.

17:14.913 --> 17:18.667
And Steve is just sitting there
like it's totally chill

17:18.750 --> 17:21.461
that our son has decided
to completely skip college.

17:21.545 --> 17:23.338
Well, why didn't you say anything?

17:23.422 --> 17:26.049
Because I blew us up and we all know it.

17:27.175 --> 17:30.762
It's the silent agreement
Steve and I co-signed.

17:30.846 --> 17:33.056
He's not allowed to punch me in the face,

17:33.140 --> 17:36.268
and I'm not allowed
to take up any more space than the couch.

17:36.351 --> 17:38.353
-Sounds healthy to me.
-Yeah, right.

17:38.437 --> 17:40.480
-Welcome home!
-Welcome home!

17:41.022 --> 17:44.609
Hi, Lyle!
I didn't know you'd still be here.

17:44.693 --> 17:47.571
-It's nice to see you again.
-Yeah, you, too. Come on in.

17:47.654 --> 17:49.281
-Great, thanks.
-Hey!

17:49.364 --> 17:52.576
-Hey!
-Welcome to page 42 of the Ikea catalog!

17:52.993 --> 17:56.830
What? Nice!
Now where do I get the Swedish meatballs?

17:58.039 --> 18:00.083
-Come here.
-Oh, my gosh.

18:01.460 --> 18:05.046
I have to say,
Che with an elevator is even hotter

18:05.130 --> 18:07.090
than Che in a five-flight walk-up.

18:07.799 --> 18:10.093
And if my TV show goes--

18:10.177 --> 18:12.637
-When your TV show goes.
-Thank you for that.

18:12.721 --> 18:14.848
And I'm taping in LA,
I will have no problem

18:14.931 --> 18:17.392
subletting it for more than I pay.

18:17.476 --> 18:20.103
Now, I'm part of the problem.

18:25.650 --> 18:27.194
Hi, I'm Carrie.

18:27.277 --> 18:30.655
I keep waiting for someone
to introduce us.

18:30.739 --> 18:31.823
Same here.

18:32.866 --> 18:36.536
Shit. Lyle, this is Carrie.
Carrie, this is Lyle.

18:36.620 --> 18:37.996
-Hi.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.372
-Likewise.
-All right, I'll take that.

18:39.456 --> 18:41.416
-I'm the designated bartender.
-Oh, okay.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.294
Lyle is a mixologist
at the Malibu Soho House.

18:44.377 --> 18:46.213
That's right, but lower your expectations.

18:46.296 --> 18:49.883
'Cause Che has no fancy glassware.
Or any glassware.

18:50.634 --> 18:51.760
Hey, show me the bedroom.

18:53.595 --> 18:54.429
Okay.

18:54.513 --> 18:57.682
But just show her.
I'm only here for one drink.

18:58.308 --> 18:59.935
Loud and clear.

19:01.937 --> 19:04.606
So, Carrie, what's your story?

19:04.689 --> 19:07.818
Let's see. What is my story?

19:07.901 --> 19:10.153
Well, as I mentioned,
I'm only here for one drink,

19:10.237 --> 19:11.613
and I'd much rather talk about you,

19:11.696 --> 19:15.033
a gentleman wearing a ring
on every single finger.

19:15.826 --> 19:18.703
What, pray-tell, is your story?

19:19.287 --> 19:20.664
Well, I was married to Che for two years.

19:21.373 --> 19:22.416
So, that's a short story.

19:23.125 --> 19:27.254
And the rings are a holdover
from my Beverly Hills hairdressing days.

19:27.337 --> 19:31.466
A Beverly Hills hairdresser.

19:31.550 --> 19:35.762
Perhaps, I'll be staying
for more than just one drink.

19:37.389 --> 19:38.849
I just--

19:40.183 --> 19:43.478
I guess I didn't think that Lyle
would still be here.

19:44.312 --> 19:47.566
Did you think he'd drive me in his truck
all the way from LA to Hudson Yards,

19:47.649 --> 19:53.488
load up all my new shit from Ikea,
swing by my old place, get my clothes,

19:54.072 --> 19:55.949
turn around
and drive 3,000 miles back?

19:57.075 --> 19:58.118
Oh, shit, that was loud.

19:58.201 --> 20:01.413
Okay. I guess when you put it that way.

20:02.289 --> 20:07.335
I just miss being with you.
So much.

20:07.878 --> 20:12.841
Me too. Me too.
He'll be sleeping on the couch.

20:13.258 --> 20:14.426
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:14.509 --> 20:18.180
Cameron Diaz,
Eva Longoria, Che Diaz

20:18.263 --> 20:20.557
-before they were Che.
-Really?

20:20.640 --> 20:24.102
Oh, yeah, yeah. This was in 2010.

20:24.186 --> 20:27.272
Che was in LA to tape
"Funny Latina Ladies" for Showtime.

20:27.647 --> 20:30.650
And an agent told them
to lose the long, flowing

20:30.734 --> 20:33.236
-Carrie Underwood hair.
-Oh, my God.

20:34.154 --> 20:35.906
So, Che came in--

20:35.989 --> 20:40.577
I gave them a sexy shag,
and then we shagged.

20:40.660 --> 20:44.539
-It's very "Shampoo" of you.
-Total compliment.

20:44.623 --> 20:48.710
Anyway, Che got cut from the special
and blamed the new haircut,

20:48.794 --> 20:50.879
so the least I could do was marry them.

20:50.962 --> 20:51.797
Yep.

20:52.297 --> 20:53.507
Oh, shit!

20:54.508 --> 20:55.675
Oh, shit.

20:58.512 --> 20:59.721
We broke your couch.

21:01.139 --> 21:02.808
It's the side you screwed in, man.

21:02.891 --> 21:04.768
Happy Housewarming!

21:05.852 --> 21:08.814
-There you are.
-Happy anniversary, my love.

21:08.897 --> 21:10.273
Happy anniversary, baby.

21:10.357 --> 21:13.610
-Hi! So sorry we're late.
-We were workin' out.

21:13.693 --> 21:16.196
-Is that what we're callin' it now?
-It's not what you think.

21:16.279 --> 21:20.075
Well, you're not late at all.
You're actually the first to arrive.

21:20.158 --> 21:22.786
Do I not exist?

21:23.286 --> 21:27.541
I am so sorry, Mother Wexley.
Yes, you were punctual, as always.

21:27.624 --> 21:29.668
Harry, they have got a beautiful
whiskey over here.

21:29.751 --> 21:31.962
-I know you're gonna love it.
-Excellent.

21:33.672 --> 21:35.632
Everything looks so beautiful.

21:35.715 --> 21:38.593
-Did you rent out the whole place?
-Yes.

21:38.677 --> 21:41.430
Is that Mark Kasabian? Do you know him?

21:41.513 --> 21:45.350
Yes, he sold me the Amy Sherald
and then a few other paintings.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.770
Hello! Happy anniversary!
Sorry, I'm late.

21:48.854 --> 21:52.441
The Jim Stall Installation
needed a little extra TLC.

21:52.524 --> 21:56.319
-Hello. Mark Kasabian.
-Hi. I am Charlotte York Goldenblatt.

21:56.403 --> 21:58.780
I have been to your gallery
countless times.

21:58.864 --> 22:00.282
It's a pleasure to meet you.

22:00.365 --> 22:02.868
And you're not late,
Mark, we just started.

22:02.951 --> 22:04.453
But didn't you say 7:30?

22:04.536 --> 22:06.872
Yes. I guess everyone is stuck in traffic?

22:06.955 --> 22:12.085
Well, I've been here since 7:15
and not so much as an hors d'oeuvre.

22:12.586 --> 22:14.963
Okay, why don't we all go in?

22:15.046 --> 22:17.257
How did I ever make it 20 years?

22:19.384 --> 22:21.595
Daddy, I'm so happy you came.

22:22.220 --> 22:27.976
Darling, this looks like it has
the makings of a magical evening.

22:28.059 --> 22:31.772
You've approached me
with that same hors d'oeuvre

22:31.855 --> 22:34.649
for the second time so far.

22:34.733 --> 22:36.735
Spoke too soon.

22:36.818 --> 22:40.572
Harry, I'd like to think that
we're more than just "dad" friends.

22:40.655 --> 22:44.993
That's nice 'cause I feel the same way.
I think of us as "friend" friends.

22:45.077 --> 22:47.954
Good. That's why I sat you
next to my mother.

22:48.038 --> 22:49.748
You seem so familiar to me.

22:49.831 --> 22:52.042
Well, I used to work
at the Wickham Gallery,

22:52.125 --> 22:53.710
back when Banks Thurlow
owned it.

22:53.794 --> 22:57.422
Wait, are you the young girl who
discovered Sonya Sklaroff,

22:57.506 --> 22:59.841
-right out of RISD?
-That was me.

22:59.925 --> 23:01.718
Yes, I used to be her.

23:01.802 --> 23:03.678
I can't believe you remember that.

23:03.762 --> 23:06.014
I always remember memorable people.

23:06.932 --> 23:08.141
Happy anniversary.

23:08.225 --> 23:13.772
Thank you. Harry, this is Lisa's father,
Mr. Lawrence Todd.

23:13.855 --> 23:18.068
He is a renowned playwright and poet,
and founder of the Newark Free Theater.

23:18.151 --> 23:20.404
No kiddin'. That's very impressive.

23:20.487 --> 23:24.741
Are you like my son-in-law here,
who's a highly paid centurion

23:24.825 --> 23:26.993
to the great god of Wall Street?

23:27.077 --> 23:28.370
Not exactly.

23:28.453 --> 23:30.914
I'm more involved in
the re-distribution of wealth.

23:30.997 --> 23:32.541
I'm a divorce lawyer.

23:32.624 --> 23:37.170
So, I guess it's all lawyers and bankers
tonight, as I feared.

23:37.254 --> 23:39.714
Honey, I just texted Susan to see
how close they were,

23:39.798 --> 23:41.049
and she just wrote back,

23:41.133 --> 23:43.468
“What are you talking about?
We're in Capri.”

23:43.552 --> 23:45.679
I mean, surely you were
tracking the RSVPs, right?

23:45.762 --> 23:49.266
-On the Paperless Post?
-I think so. Hang on.

23:52.936 --> 23:54.271
I think I see the problem.

23:54.688 --> 23:55.689
And?

23:57.149 --> 23:58.358
I never hit send.

23:58.442 --> 23:59.985
What do you mean?
You never hit send on what?

24:00.902 --> 24:03.405
The invitations? Herbert!

24:04.448 --> 24:06.700
So, hello.

24:07.826 --> 24:13.707
We wanted to keep you up to speed on
this situation that we find ourselves in.

24:13.790 --> 24:14.875
Honey, would you--

24:14.958 --> 24:17.753
Herbert forgot to hit send
on the invitations.

24:17.836 --> 24:20.130
So, all of you who are actually here

24:20.213 --> 24:22.632
were invited the old-fashioned way,
by talking.

24:22.716 --> 24:26.052
Everyone else is in Europe
or the Hamptons by now.

24:26.136 --> 24:27.804
So, I hope you're hungry

24:27.888 --> 24:31.975
because we have a four-course meal
coming for 31 people.

24:32.058 --> 24:34.060
-Oh, my God.
-And...

24:34.728 --> 24:36.354
and oysters don't keep.

24:37.481 --> 24:39.900
Okay, full disclosure.
I was planning to stop in

24:39.983 --> 24:42.486
for a quick drink and then take off,

24:42.569 --> 24:45.405
but now it feels too awkward to leave.

24:45.489 --> 24:47.657
Oh, no, you can't leave now.

24:48.158 --> 24:50.660
Oh, no.
We took our wedding very seriously.

24:51.578 --> 24:55.040
We were married in Vegas
by an Elvis impersonator

24:55.123 --> 24:57.417
both of us dressed as Elvis.

24:59.669 --> 25:01.379
Jannie was dressed as Priscilla.

25:02.214 --> 25:03.298
-Jannie.
-Jannie.

25:03.381 --> 25:06.384
-Who's Jannie?
-Jannie was, kind of, our girlfriend

25:06.468 --> 25:07.719
for a few months.

25:07.803 --> 25:09.763
Yeah, we were poly-pioneers.

25:10.305 --> 25:14.101
Meanwhile, I was cutting up
carrot sticks for Brady's lunchbox.

25:16.561 --> 25:18.522
Carrie, I know what you're thinking.

25:18.605 --> 25:21.024
Really? 'Cause I'm not even sure.

25:21.108 --> 25:23.610
This wasn't some pervy, straight guy idea.

25:23.693 --> 25:25.487
In fact,
I wasn't even down with this at first,

25:25.570 --> 25:28.532
but young Che over here
wanted to break out of the old norms.

25:29.282 --> 25:30.951
Hello? Not just me.

25:31.034 --> 25:33.036
It was totally just you.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.038
You said it was important for us

25:35.122 --> 25:37.707
to push our relationship boundaries,
right?

25:37.791 --> 25:41.128
And if I was afraid to explore that

25:41.211 --> 25:46.049
I wasn't for you, so I figured, well,
"happy life, happy wife."

25:46.133 --> 25:49.511
-Marriage takes sacrifice.
-Speaking of sacrifice,

25:50.720 --> 25:53.098
Jannie was my first pegging.

25:53.181 --> 25:55.600
-Well, look at the time.
-I guess that's not

25:55.684 --> 25:57.561
-ice-breaker conversation.
-Oh, shit.

25:57.644 --> 25:59.938
Is my first strap-on experience
off the table?

26:00.897 --> 26:02.107
You know, I still don't know

26:02.190 --> 26:04.818
how I feel about the first time
I wore a strap-on.

26:04.901 --> 26:06.278
How am I still in this room?

26:07.654 --> 26:09.906
Oh, okay. We'll walk ya out.

26:09.990 --> 26:11.658
-Lobster, sir?
-More lobster?

26:11.742 --> 26:12.576
Hello.

26:12.951 --> 26:13.910
More lobster!

26:14.786 --> 26:15.746
-Eat up, everyone.
-No, no thank you.

26:15.829 --> 26:17.706
There's lots more of it.

26:17.789 --> 26:21.710
Mother, wouldn't you like
to come down here and join us?

26:21.793 --> 26:26.715
This was the only seat without
the air conditioning blasting on it.

26:27.507 --> 26:29.301
Honey, go back and keep her company.

26:29.384 --> 26:31.344
Yeah, I feel like I did my time.

26:31.428 --> 26:33.096
More lobster, sir?

26:35.849 --> 26:37.017
Thank you.

26:37.100 --> 26:39.770
Texting at the table. I apologize.

26:39.853 --> 26:41.813
Well, if you weren't so nice,

26:41.897 --> 26:44.566
you would be home by now,
so I'll allow it.

26:44.858 --> 26:47.986
My 10-year-old found a way to smuggle
her cell phone into camp

26:48.070 --> 26:50.238
-and she's torturing me nonstop...
-Another lobster, sir.

26:50.322 --> 26:51.656
...begging to be picked up.

26:52.657 --> 26:55.327
Both my kids were homesick first time
at sleepaway camp.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.287
Yours will adjust, I promise.

26:59.081 --> 27:01.041
Madness. This is Delilah again!

27:01.124 --> 27:03.668
Don't answer it. In fact, give it to me.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.462
-Excuse me?
-I'm serious.

27:05.545 --> 27:07.839
If they smell weakness,
they are like bloodhounds

27:07.923 --> 27:09.800
and they will go in for the kill.

27:09.883 --> 27:11.051
Give me the phone.

27:12.677 --> 27:16.223
I'd like to make a toast
to my beautiful daughter, Lisa,

27:16.306 --> 27:19.976
and her magnificent film
that I've just been told

27:20.060 --> 27:24.606
is in the Tribeca Film Festival!

27:25.023 --> 27:27.025
He does know it's our anniversary, right?

27:27.275 --> 27:29.194
Thank you, Daddy. Cheers!

27:29.277 --> 27:31.446
-Happy news!
-Hear, hear.

27:33.907 --> 27:35.075
Shit!

27:35.158 --> 27:36.159
Fuck.

27:36.743 --> 27:38.245
Well, I guess he was exhausted.

27:39.121 --> 27:41.498
Could you wake him up
and move him to the couch?

27:41.581 --> 27:43.500
The broken couch?

27:44.626 --> 27:47.462
He sleeps like a dead man.
And, honestly, I am so tired.

27:47.546 --> 27:49.172
I'm gonna pass out, too.

27:51.007 --> 27:53.427
You're gonna make it up to me tomorrow.

27:53.510 --> 27:54.511
Okay.

27:57.097 --> 27:58.974
Oh, God.

28:00.392 --> 28:04.396
So, Delilah's mother, my third ex-wife,
had a mid-life crisis.

28:04.479 --> 28:06.523
I guess it was all too much for her.

28:06.606 --> 28:10.068
Well, there are very few
Lisa Todd Wexleys in the world,

28:10.152 --> 28:12.320
-who can juggle everything so gracefully.
-We have 31 buffers between 'em.

28:12.404 --> 28:15.240
And look at her now,
getting back to her passion.

28:15.323 --> 28:16.450
More wine, ma'am?

28:17.743 --> 28:21.163
Why don't you follow her lead?
Come work for me.

28:21.955 --> 28:24.291
-If only.
-No, I'm being serious.

28:24.374 --> 28:28.670
I would love to invite someone
with your taste and tenacity

28:28.754 --> 28:30.338
into my gallery. And I promise,

28:30.422 --> 28:33.884
it's not only to rip the phone
out of my hand occasionally.

28:37.137 --> 28:42.642
It's been so long and my kids
need me even more these days.

28:42.726 --> 28:43.727
But

28:44.895 --> 28:47.981
you've really made my night by asking me.

28:49.149 --> 28:51.777
If you ever change your mind,
you know where I am.

28:53.653 --> 28:57.699
Okay. I think it's safe to leave now.

28:57.783 --> 29:02.287
Hey, everyone, dessert's comin' up.

29:02.370 --> 29:04.331
Save room, there's lots of it.

29:04.414 --> 29:08.168
Yes, in fact,
this is a very special dessert

29:08.251 --> 29:10.420
from our first date

29:10.504 --> 29:13.256
-when you took me for coffee and cake--
-Oh, yeah.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.300
Oh, my God.

29:15.842 --> 29:18.095
-What?
-Oh, my God, I forgot to order the cake.

29:18.178 --> 29:19.679
What?

29:19.763 --> 29:23.767
Lisa, did you say you
forgot to order the cake?

29:23.850 --> 29:27.229
Yes! Yes, I did. I'm so sorry.

29:27.312 --> 29:29.147
Well, I'm stuffed.

29:29.231 --> 29:31.066
Maybe it's a blessin' in disguise, right?

29:31.149 --> 29:36.446
Well, if I understand you correctly,
you didn't send out the proper invitations

29:36.530 --> 29:39.032
because you were working so much.

29:39.533 --> 29:43.370
And then, you forgot to order the cake.

29:43.453 --> 29:47.416
Shall I tell you why
I never forgot to order the cake?

29:47.499 --> 29:49.543
Mother, please.

29:49.626 --> 29:54.256
Because I baked them all myself
and I was happy to do it.

29:54.339 --> 29:57.676
It helped my husband's
business to flourish.

29:57.759 --> 30:00.178
Yeah, well,
things are a little different now.

30:00.262 --> 30:01.763
I have my own career.

30:01.847 --> 30:03.473
And I had mine.

30:03.557 --> 30:06.226
I was a concert pianist,

30:06.309 --> 30:10.439
but when I became a mother,
my priorities changed.

30:10.522 --> 30:11.440
May I have my phone back, please?

30:11.523 --> 30:12.941
Well, Mrs. Wexley,

30:13.024 --> 30:16.111
just because you let
your dream wither away

30:16.194 --> 30:19.156
doesn't mean that my daughter has to.

30:19.239 --> 30:21.825
Lisa Todd is an artist.

30:21.908 --> 30:26.496
She's putting beauty
and ideas into the world,

30:26.580 --> 30:31.001
rather than just praying
to the almighty dollar

30:31.585 --> 30:33.170
like your son here.

30:33.253 --> 30:34.421
Thank you for the compliment, Daddy,

30:34.504 --> 30:36.548
but Herbert is concerned
with lots of things

30:36.631 --> 30:38.049
that have nothing to do with money.

30:38.133 --> 30:40.135
Really? Could've fooled me.

30:40.761 --> 30:45.974
Name one project that he's working on
that doesn't revolve around profit.

30:48.435 --> 30:50.061
I rest my case.

30:54.024 --> 30:56.818
Herbert is running for City Comptroller.

30:56.902 --> 30:58.904
-He is?
-He is?

30:58.987 --> 31:02.574
-I am?
-Yes! He wants to give back.

31:02.657 --> 31:07.079
And I support his decision 100%.

31:07.621 --> 31:10.040
-Hear, hear!
-Cheers!

31:10.749 --> 31:12.501
Can I come back down there now?

31:37.943 --> 31:40.320
Are we really doing this?

31:40.404 --> 31:42.572
I feel like my freshman-year roommate

31:42.656 --> 31:45.617
who used to have sex while
I was three feet away in the next bed.

31:47.411 --> 31:48.412
Yeah.

31:52.165 --> 31:53.208
Okay.

31:58.463 --> 32:00.382
Oh, yeah.

32:28.368 --> 32:30.328
Are you okay with this?

32:33.957 --> 32:35.041
Thank you for asking.

32:35.125 --> 32:39.254
I need to think about this for a minute
because my visceral reaction is "no,"

32:39.337 --> 32:41.173
but maybe that's just fear of the unknown.

32:41.256 --> 32:45.010
Because, I mean,
how will I ever know unless I try it?

32:45.093 --> 32:47.262
We're all here. It's kinda hot.

32:47.345 --> 32:49.765
It's getting less hot the more you talk.

32:58.774 --> 33:00.358
Is that a yes?

33:02.152 --> 33:03.153
Yes.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.873
Oh, yeah.

33:48.657 --> 33:50.200
-Charley horse!
-No, no, no!

33:50.742 --> 33:51.827
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong?

33:51.910 --> 33:52.869
Oh, that's bad!

33:56.873 --> 33:58.083
I just--

33:58.708 --> 34:00.585
You know what, guys?

34:01.169 --> 34:06.383
This just isn't me, so just, just--
You should, you should carry on.

34:06.466 --> 34:09.594
Seriously, I'm good with it.

34:10.762 --> 34:11.763
Fuck!

34:12.514 --> 34:13.640
Fucking hell.

34:36.913 --> 34:38.123
Hey.

34:38.623 --> 34:41.126
You really didn't have to stop.
I meant that.

34:42.169 --> 34:45.005
I know, but I missed you.

34:49.968 --> 34:51.344
Oh, God.

34:56.641 --> 34:59.144
There we go. Yeah.

35:08.070 --> 35:12.949
If you're calling to ask to be my wing-man
at "Vivante!" the answer is yes.

35:13.033 --> 35:14.409
Oh, no, I couldn't come to that.

35:14.493 --> 35:17.162
You know what they say,
never meet your heroes.

35:17.245 --> 35:20.874
Do they also say, "Never ask your old boss
to plug your book"?

35:20.957 --> 35:22.042
Because...

35:23.376 --> 35:25.670
I might not be brave enough
to pull that off today.

35:25.754 --> 35:28.048
Okay, that's why I called.
I sensed you'd cave.

35:28.131 --> 35:31.218
Carrie,
don't be afraid to be transactional.

35:31.301 --> 35:34.137
Enid's a work-contact, not a gal-pal.

35:34.805 --> 35:36.306
-I'll do what I can.
-Do more.

35:36.389 --> 35:37.641
You need this for your book sales.

35:37.724 --> 35:40.560
And just don't get in any photo
near women with walkers.

35:40.644 --> 35:43.563
That'd be a brand-killer for you.
Let's go, Rocco.

35:44.856 --> 35:46.650
-Hello. Hello.
-Welcome.

35:46.733 --> 35:48.443
Hi. Can we get a photo
of you three ladies?

35:49.736 --> 35:50.862
Yes.

35:50.946 --> 35:52.197
Oh, no, I don't wanna--

35:52.280 --> 35:53.907
My hair is so-- No, no, no.

35:53.990 --> 35:55.409
Thank you, but thank you.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.708
Can I...

36:03.792 --> 36:04.960
Do you need any help?

36:05.043 --> 36:07.254
Do I look like I need help?

36:08.380 --> 36:09.756
Kinda.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.634
So, tell me when you need me
to do the thing, okay?

36:12.717 --> 36:14.094
-Okay.
-Okay. All right.

36:14.177 --> 36:15.262
-That's Gloria Steinem.
-Oh, my gosh!

36:15.345 --> 36:16.763
Hello, hello, hello.

36:16.847 --> 36:18.306
Hi, how are you?

36:18.390 --> 36:19.933
That was Gloria Steinem!

36:21.226 --> 36:23.145
-Enid, hi.
-Hi.

36:23.228 --> 36:25.063
Thank you for including me.

36:25.147 --> 36:27.858
Well, when I got the idea for "Vivante!"

36:27.941 --> 36:30.902
the first name that I thought of
was Carrie Bradshaw.

36:30.986 --> 36:33.655
And-- Oh, hello.

36:34.489 --> 36:37.325
That's Jane Rosen. Money.

36:37.868 --> 36:40.120
I should say hello.
You and I will talk later.

36:40.203 --> 36:45.000
Oh, great! And because just to circle back
to our earlier conversation,

36:45.083 --> 36:48.378
the one that we were, you know,
having at breakfast the other day--

36:48.462 --> 36:50.589
Carrie! Carrie, hello!

36:51.798 --> 36:53.258
You know Bitsy von Muffling?

36:53.341 --> 36:55.510
Just tangentially, through my boyfriend.

36:55.594 --> 36:57.596
She's only here 'cause she has
deep pockets.

36:59.389 --> 37:00.932
Oh, my God.

37:01.016 --> 37:02.684
-Hi.
-I don't know what this afternoon

37:02.768 --> 37:05.103
is gonna cost me, but it's worth it.

37:05.771 --> 37:07.272
Gloria Steinem!

37:07.355 --> 37:09.357
-I saw her. She walked past me.
-I know!

37:09.441 --> 37:12.110
-You look very pink. Pretty--
-Well, thank you.

37:12.194 --> 37:14.071
Excuse me, everyone.

37:14.154 --> 37:15.781
Ladies, welcome.

37:15.864 --> 37:18.700
I think this might be
the greatest gathering

37:18.784 --> 37:23.747
of female minds since Eleanor Roosevelt
had dinner alone at the White House.

37:25.707 --> 37:28.668
Which we know she did often
because she wasn't a lot of fun.

37:30.504 --> 37:33.465
Let's get seated so we can begin.

37:33.548 --> 37:38.804
So, what do you think of Marlon Schaffer?

37:41.807 --> 37:44.476
You're the little birdie?

37:44.559 --> 37:45.894
Tweet-tweet.

37:46.561 --> 37:53.026
Well, ever since I saw you so, so sad
in the nail salon that day,

37:53.110 --> 37:56.029
I wanted to do whatever I could
to cheer you up.

37:56.571 --> 37:58.240
Isn't he wonderful?

37:58.698 --> 38:00.450
I don't--

38:00.534 --> 38:04.621
He doesn't exactly seem right for me.

38:04.704 --> 38:06.998
Don't let the Albany area code throw you.

38:07.082 --> 38:09.000
He also has a place in town.

38:09.084 --> 38:11.211
-Okay.
-And, Carrie, trust me,

38:11.294 --> 38:15.090
the best way to get over someone is to get
under someone else.

38:15.173 --> 38:17.717
You know,
maybe I should give this prime seat to--

38:17.801 --> 38:21.138
And if you're going to get under someone,
it should be Marlon.

38:21.221 --> 38:23.223
The best sex I've had since Bobby.

38:23.306 --> 38:27.102
I mean, of course, no one could please me
in bed like my Bobby.

38:27.602 --> 38:32.065
So attentive to my needs.
Mr. Broadway loved his lady.

38:32.774 --> 38:35.485
My head is spinning.

38:35.569 --> 38:39.281
I was always under the impression
that Bobby was gay.

38:39.364 --> 38:41.950
He was!
That's why he tried so hard.

38:42.492 --> 38:43.326
You know me.

38:43.410 --> 38:45.162
I love a challenge.

38:45.245 --> 38:47.581
Clearly unfinished business
with my father.

38:48.373 --> 38:53.170
Bitsy, I so appreciate it, really, I do,
but I'm doing much better.

38:53.253 --> 38:54.838
Don't be hasty!

38:54.921 --> 38:58.258
Ladies around town call Marlon
"the human tripod"

38:58.341 --> 39:01.344
'cause it's like he has three legs.

39:02.053 --> 39:03.680
-Do you need a seat, Catherine?
-My God.

39:03.764 --> 39:05.015
-Would you like this?
-Thank you.

39:05.098 --> 39:09.060
Yeah. No, I see one way over there.
You have a seat.

39:09.144 --> 39:11.605
So, when Enid told me about "Vivante!"

39:11.688 --> 39:14.691
I thought it sounded like a revolution,

39:14.775 --> 39:18.403
and every revolution
starts with a conversation,

39:18.487 --> 39:20.447
which is why we are here.

39:20.530 --> 39:22.783
This is the way "Ms." magazine started.

39:22.866 --> 39:25.160
Can't believe it was a half-century ago.

39:25.243 --> 39:26.286
Oh, my God.

39:27.245 --> 39:30.499
So, maybe the new frontier is aging.

39:30.582 --> 39:34.252
So, this is our new frontier
and you are it, folks.

39:35.212 --> 39:39.841
We live longer than men,
which we don't mean to do, actually.

39:43.762 --> 39:46.014
But for all of us, women and men,

39:46.098 --> 39:49.893
with our much longer life
expectancy in this world

39:49.976 --> 39:56.316
I think we're beginning to see
all kinds of new possibilities.

39:56.400 --> 40:01.530
And the more we understand that,
the more we stop being divided

40:01.613 --> 40:05.534
by age and race and culture and gender.

40:05.617 --> 40:11.039
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you, baby. I love you.

40:16.378 --> 40:18.255
How'd we do? How'd we do?

40:18.338 --> 40:20.757
Happy Fourth of July.

40:28.390 --> 40:29.683
Wow, gosh.

40:29.766 --> 40:32.394
-There's probably no original way--
-Talk or go!

40:32.477 --> 40:34.271
Sorry. No, you go. Sorry.

40:34.354 --> 40:36.773
-I think we should--
-Here, guess we'll-- Yeah, over here.

40:36.857 --> 40:41.153
There's really no-- I'm sor-- Here.
Excuse me. Sorry.

40:41.236 --> 40:42.654
Anyway, there's, like I said,

40:42.738 --> 40:45.699
no original way to say this,
but, so, just thank you.

40:45.782 --> 40:49.327
Thank you.
I have admired you my entire life.

40:49.411 --> 40:52.164
Well, I guess that means we care
about the same things.

40:52.247 --> 40:54.791
I would like to think so, yes.

40:54.875 --> 40:58.044
And I'm not proud to admit,
but I almost didn't come today

40:58.128 --> 41:03.759
because I thought that
maybe I didn't quite belong.

41:03.842 --> 41:07.763
I'm afraid I'm still battling my own
deep-seated ageism.

41:07.846 --> 41:09.014
We're all battling that.

41:09.097 --> 41:10.891
But we are at the age of

41:10.974 --> 41:14.895
-our minds, not our wombs, hello.
-Yes. Yes, exactly.

41:14.978 --> 41:15.979
Excuse me.

41:16.063 --> 41:18.565
The "Vivante!" photographer
is desperate for you.

41:18.648 --> 41:20.358
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Thank you.

41:20.442 --> 41:23.862
-We'll meet again.
-Okay. I hope so. Thank you.

41:25.614 --> 41:27.282
Oh, my gosh, Enid, hi.

41:27.365 --> 41:29.659
This was thrilling, really.

41:29.743 --> 41:32.370
I would be honored to write for "Vivante!"

41:32.454 --> 41:35.999
I don't want you to write
a thousand words about purses.

41:36.083 --> 41:38.794
I want you to give $100,000.

41:39.795 --> 41:40.629
Pardon me?

41:40.712 --> 41:45.092
We're asking founding donors
to give $100,000.

41:45.175 --> 41:50.013
So, I'm not here because of my age,

41:50.097 --> 41:53.058
I'm here because of my deep pockets?

41:53.141 --> 41:55.894
Due to tragic circumstances,

41:55.977 --> 42:00.607
your pockets recently got deeper, so, yes.

42:01.149 --> 42:04.903
Well, Enid, if I gave you $100,000,

42:04.986 --> 42:08.657
I'd have to give everyone $100,000.

42:09.783 --> 42:11.243
Touché.

42:11.326 --> 42:13.203
What if I put you in "Ask Enid,"

42:13.286 --> 42:15.956
how much would you be
comfortable investing?

42:16.039 --> 42:17.416
Enid, I'm heading out.

42:17.499 --> 42:19.167
Forgive me for asking.

42:19.251 --> 42:22.045
Would you mind terribly being in a photo
with Enid and me?

42:22.129 --> 42:24.381
-I would love that.
-Oh, wow, okay.

42:24.464 --> 42:25.841
-Would you take it?
-Absolutely.

42:25.924 --> 42:27.884
-Thank you. There you go.
-All righty.

42:27.968 --> 42:29.678
-Okay, ladies.
-Okay, all right. Here we are.

42:29.761 --> 42:31.721
-We'll do this fast, sorry.
-Ready for picture.

42:32.973 --> 42:34.850
Fabulous. Fabulous.

42:34.933 --> 42:38.186
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much, Gloria.

42:38.270 --> 42:39.688
Bye. Safe home.

42:41.064 --> 42:42.816
Let me eyeball that.

42:42.899 --> 42:44.860
-I've been burned before.
-Sure, turn it the other way.

42:50.407 --> 42:51.742
Carrie?

42:51.825 --> 42:54.119
Are you schtupping my boyfriend?

42:54.202 --> 42:57.789
What? Why would you even ask that?

42:57.873 --> 42:59.624
This is my Marlon's pecker.

42:59.708 --> 43:00.709
Why would you have this

43:00.792 --> 43:03.044
-if you weren't dating him?
-No, no, no, no.

43:03.128 --> 43:07.841
Someone was trying to set me up with him,
and I said no.

43:08.216 --> 43:10.552
I would never date a man that old.

43:10.635 --> 43:12.471
But I would?

43:12.929 --> 43:17.350
So, let's circle back
to what we were talking about before.

43:17.434 --> 43:19.269
Before you called me old?

43:19.352 --> 43:22.397
So, how much did you say you wanted?

43:22.481 --> 43:25.442
I don't think I have
my checkbook with me today but--

43:25.525 --> 43:27.527
PayPal works.

43:28.737 --> 43:30.072
Okay, yeah.

43:30.739 --> 43:32.699
I don't use PayPal much, so.

43:32.783 --> 43:38.580
And just like that,
Enid and I became PayPals.
