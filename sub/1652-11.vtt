00:01.314 --> 00:02.714
If you want a life,

00:03.128 --> 00:04.864
better than what you got...

00:05.169 --> 00:07.398
I will help you get to the other side.

00:07.437 --> 00:08.845
- I can't.
- Hello?

00:09.456 --> 00:11.872
- This your first time firing your weapon?
- Yeah.

00:14.164 --> 00:16.244
I'm around anytime you need to talk.

00:18.230 --> 00:19.724
What are you doing here?

00:39.186 --> 00:40.620
Finally.

01:17.124 --> 01:18.358
$3.25.

01:20.394 --> 01:21.394
Hey.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.835
I wanted to come talk to
you, like, a million times.

01:32.940 --> 01:36.542
I'm clean.

01:36.577 --> 01:38.378
30 days.

01:41.715 --> 01:43.616
Congratulations, Nadia.

01:43.651 --> 01:46.152
Sincerely.

01:46.186 --> 01:47.854
Thank you.

01:48.956 --> 01:50.256
For trying with me.

01:51.425 --> 01:52.625
Look, I know it took a few times,

01:52.660 --> 01:56.763
but what you did for me, it really stuck.

02:01.802 --> 02:03.202
Take care of yourself.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.508
In the NFL, they've got
these cold weather vests...

02:08.542 --> 02:10.198
- Yeah?
- Battery-operated or something,

02:10.199 --> 02:12.060
to keep 'em nice and
toasty on the sidelines.

02:12.061 --> 02:13.046
Yeah.

02:13.421 --> 02:14.988
Lightweight, thin material, perfect for us.

02:15.022 --> 02:17.357
Who do I talk to in the district
about something like that?

02:17.391 --> 02:19.225
Well, let me look that up for you, I'll...

02:19.260 --> 02:20.360
once I get to a computer.

02:20.394 --> 02:22.295
You know it's a good idea.

02:22.329 --> 02:25.465
Sorry.

02:25.499 --> 02:27.834
- What's up, bro?
- How you doin', man?

02:27.868 --> 02:29.169
Your fly's open.

02:29.203 --> 02:31.938
Hey, Narcissus, come on over here.

02:31.973 --> 02:34.174
- Who?
- Come over here.

02:34.208 --> 02:35.308
Yeah?

02:35.342 --> 02:36.843
What do you got going on Friday night?

02:36.877 --> 02:37.911
Uh...

02:37.945 --> 02:38.912
I need you.

02:38.946 --> 02:39.913
Off the books.

02:39.947 --> 02:40.980
- Should I be worried?
- No.

02:41.015 --> 02:42.549
Why? You got something to hide?

02:42.583 --> 02:44.717
No, I'm jut trying to figure
out what you're asking me.

02:44.752 --> 02:46.186
I'm not asking you; I'm telling you,

02:46.220 --> 02:47.253
and you'll find out Friday.

02:47.288 --> 02:48.855
So meet out here and wear something nice.

02:48.889 --> 02:51.491
- Something nice?
- Yeah.

02:51.525 --> 02:53.293
Are you hearing this?

02:53.327 --> 02:54.360
We gotta move.

02:54.395 --> 02:56.062
- Hey, what's going on?
- A massacre.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.535
- There you go.
- Detective.

03:19.954 --> 03:22.255
All right, where are we at so far?

03:22.289 --> 03:24.791
The four guards are dead,
and one guy's wounded.

03:24.825 --> 03:25.892
What'd they get?

03:25.926 --> 03:27.794
Eight million in cash.

03:27.828 --> 03:30.630
International currency
shipment from Nagano, Japan,

03:30.664 --> 03:33.466
headed down to the
federal reserve on Lasalle.

03:33.501 --> 03:34.634
They cleared customs fine,

03:34.668 --> 03:35.702
and then the money came here

03:35.736 --> 03:37.003
to be loaded onto an armored car.

03:37.038 --> 03:38.438
Can the survivor tell us anything?

03:38.472 --> 03:39.606
Yeah.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.207
The one guy that's stable is Lukas Perko.

03:41.242 --> 03:42.575
He's the warehouse manager

03:42.610 --> 03:44.711
and Eric Gonzalez, head of security.

03:44.745 --> 03:45.979
All right, you grab him.

03:46.013 --> 03:47.380
- We'll talk to Perko.
- Okay.

03:49.884 --> 03:50.850
How you doing?

03:50.885 --> 03:53.920
I don't know.

03:53.954 --> 03:55.855
They say it's a through and through.

03:55.890 --> 03:58.158
Hey, can you give us a minute?

03:58.192 --> 04:00.593
Yes, sir.

04:00.628 --> 04:04.197
Thank you.

04:04.231 --> 04:05.398
What'd you see?

04:05.433 --> 04:07.467
Four of 'em.

04:07.501 --> 04:13.406
Black hoodie, masks, dark shades, bandanas.

04:13.441 --> 04:14.908
They lit the place up, man.

04:14.942 --> 04:17.077
It all happened just like...  that.

04:17.111 --> 04:19.045
And where were you when they came in?

04:19.079 --> 04:21.348
I was in the john,

04:21.382 --> 04:23.383
and I come runnin' out.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.251
And I saw a gun swing my way.

04:25.286 --> 04:28.054
I heard sounds like firecrackers.

04:28.089 --> 04:30.056
I got hit. I dropped.

04:30.091 --> 04:31.558
I guess they thought you were dead.

04:32.693 --> 04:34.227
Yeah, I guess.

04:34.261 --> 04:35.895
Height? Weight?

04:35.930 --> 04:36.896
Anything else?

04:36.931 --> 04:41.067
I caught a glimpse of
their foreheads and necks.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.869
Black guys, for sure.

04:44.772 --> 04:47.374
It doesn't make any sense.

04:47.408 --> 04:50.176
It was Reginald's birthday tomorrow.

04:50.211 --> 04:52.245
We were gonna go to the
Pink Monkey, all of us.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.747
What'd you see?

04:53.781 --> 04:57.851
I was in my office in
the back of the building.

04:57.885 --> 05:01.087
I heard, like, a pop, pop, pop.

05:01.122 --> 05:03.256
And by the time I got here, it was...

05:03.290 --> 05:06.059
everyone was just... I mean, I tried to

05:06.093 --> 05:07.894
hold Tinker's head with my hand,

05:07.928 --> 05:09.929
but I couldn't keep the blood in.

05:11.499 --> 05:15.735
We're gonna need to see all
of your security footage.

05:15.770 --> 05:16.736
Yeah, whatever you need.

05:20.641 --> 05:22.208
What did you get from the security guy?

05:22.243 --> 05:23.309
He seemed in genuine shock.

05:23.344 --> 05:25.111
What about your guy?

05:25.146 --> 05:26.680
Eight million reasons I can think of

05:26.714 --> 05:27.881
why one of 'em is lying.

05:30.102 --> 05:34.270
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:40.898 --> 05:42.832
What's up with you and Ruzek?

05:42.866 --> 05:45.535
What do you mean?

05:45.569 --> 05:48.504
I mean, you looked like you
were at the seventh grade dance

05:48.539 --> 05:49.839
when you bumped into him earlier.

05:49.873 --> 05:51.007
Now, I'm sayin' his name,

05:51.041 --> 05:52.775
and you don't look much better.

05:52.809 --> 05:55.244
It's, uh...

05:55.279 --> 05:57.547
I don't know what it is.

05:57.581 --> 05:58.748
Permission to speak freely?

05:59.817 --> 06:01.517
Sure, as long as I have permission

06:01.552 --> 06:03.986
to kick you in the ass if
I don't like what you say.

06:04.021 --> 06:06.255
Okay.

06:06.290 --> 06:08.691
If your big plan is to sleep
your way into Intelligence,

06:08.725 --> 06:13.362
I'm not sure if that's the
right guy to make that happen.

06:13.397 --> 06:14.597
I'm jokin'. I'm jokin'.

06:14.631 --> 06:15.798
- Get off me, Atwater.
- I'm playin'.

06:15.833 --> 06:16.999
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

06:28.979 --> 06:31.881
All right, Perko's been with
the company for two years.

06:31.915 --> 06:33.483
He's got no criminal record.

06:33.517 --> 06:35.418
He did have a juvey one, though.

06:35.452 --> 06:38.387
Perko and his brother
Dominik got pinched at 15

06:38.422 --> 06:40.223
on a drug conspiracy for selling meth.

06:40.257 --> 06:42.225
He had a mandatory release at 18

06:42.259 --> 06:43.926
and stayed on the straight and narrow,

06:43.961 --> 06:46.195
but the brother kept
dealing for a Croatian gang,

06:46.230 --> 06:47.763
the Two-Threes.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.099
Brother's currently serving
eight years at Stateville.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.267
Okay.

06:51.301 --> 06:53.736
So they had six video cameras,

06:53.771 --> 06:55.705
which you'd think would be aces, right?

06:55.739 --> 06:58.674
But, as you can see, cameras one and two,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.109
the crew stays too far out of frame

07:00.144 --> 07:01.878
to be of any useful identification.

07:01.912 --> 07:04.313
Three and four, they stay
out of frame all together.

07:04.348 --> 07:06.215
And on five, they keep
their backs to the camera.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.384
And six, the one camera
that they can't avoid,

07:08.418 --> 07:11.020
well, it's conveniently
obscured by the gate.

07:11.054 --> 07:12.989
There's no way this isn't an inside job.

07:13.023 --> 07:14.690
I talked to the dicks over at Area South.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.326
One of the canvassing
detectives interviewed a trucker

07:17.361 --> 07:19.328
who said that he saw a
panel van fleeing the scene.

07:19.363 --> 07:21.063
- Tags?
- Nothing.

07:21.098 --> 07:24.167
Except he saw two of the
guys remove their masks.

07:24.201 --> 07:25.735
Now, he didn't get a
good look at their faces,

07:25.769 --> 07:28.237
but he said they were both Caucasian males.

07:28.272 --> 07:30.106
So Perko lied.

07:30.140 --> 07:32.041
The old "black guys did it" defense.

07:32.075 --> 07:33.709
He's in the E.R. at Chicago Med.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.845
Yeah, I'd like first
crack at this one, boss.

07:35.879 --> 07:37.647
You lookin' to prove yourself, Sumner?

07:37.681 --> 07:39.182
I'm ready to grill him till he rolls.

07:39.216 --> 07:40.516
Good.

07:40.551 --> 07:42.251
Take Antonio with you.

07:48.258 --> 07:49.525
- Allie.
- Hi, Jay.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.094
Hey.

07:52.129 --> 07:54.931
I was just picking up a book
for my dad up the street,

07:54.965 --> 07:56.465
and I thought I would just...

07:59.803 --> 08:02.004
I had a great time.

08:02.039 --> 08:04.574
And I'm glad you stopped by, okay?

08:08.512 --> 08:11.314
- Tomorrow night then?
- Tomorrow night.

08:16.386 --> 08:18.654
And?

08:18.689 --> 08:20.056
She's just a girl I know.

08:20.090 --> 08:22.358
Ah.

08:22.392 --> 08:24.827
How's it going with the fireman?

08:24.862 --> 08:26.796
We're taking things slow.

08:26.830 --> 08:27.997
Oh.

08:31.702 --> 08:33.302
Hey.

08:33.337 --> 08:35.304
The detectives, right?

08:35.339 --> 08:36.304
I was just thinking...

08:36.340 --> 08:37.707
We know it was an inside job,

08:37.741 --> 08:39.775
so we started wondering,

08:39.809 --> 08:42.345
could it be the one guy who walks away

08:42.379 --> 08:44.781
while everyone else
catches a dozen bullets?

08:44.815 --> 08:46.182
Inside job?

08:46.216 --> 08:47.350
Maybe it's the guy with a juvey record

08:47.384 --> 08:48.584
and a brother in Stateville.

08:48.619 --> 08:50.553
Hey, I was just a shorty.

08:50.587 --> 08:53.790
Or maybe it's the guy who lied
about the crew being black.

08:59.863 --> 09:01.330
Okay, look.

09:01.365 --> 09:04.901
The guy who shot me, I recognized him.

09:04.935 --> 09:08.704
His... his bandana slipped.

09:08.739 --> 09:11.541
He's from my neighborhood,
but I don't know his name.

09:11.575 --> 09:14.477
I mean, he's in the Two-Three's.

09:14.511 --> 09:17.380
These guys, they got a lot of reach.

09:17.414 --> 09:19.582
I roll, they find my brother in the prison.

09:19.616 --> 09:24.187
Imagine your face for the world to see

09:24.221 --> 09:27.056
next to the word "racist"
in the dictionary.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.862
Okay.

09:37.901 --> 09:39.068
Dennis Novak.

09:39.103 --> 09:40.970
N-o-v-a-k?

09:41.004 --> 09:42.238
Yeah.

09:44.174 --> 09:47.376
Dennis Novak from East Pilsen?

09:47.411 --> 09:50.046
Look, his crew sells kush, x,

09:50.080 --> 09:51.747
whatever they're calling junk these days.

09:51.782 --> 09:53.883
He's a low-level jab slinger.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.017
It's way out of his league.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.352
He's telling the truth.

10:01.758 --> 10:03.059
Okay.

10:03.093 --> 10:06.562
Reach out to your CI's,
the Hypes, the Lot Lizards.

10:06.597 --> 10:09.265
Find out where in my city
this guy thinks he can hide.

10:13.570 --> 10:14.537
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:14.571 --> 10:15.772
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

10:15.806 --> 10:16.806
Yeah, my bad.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.880
Sarge, I'm willing to
help you and everything,

10:23.914 --> 10:25.715
but you gotta tell me what's going on here.

10:27.384 --> 10:29.352
I gotta close the dad deal.

10:29.386 --> 10:32.321
The... the what now?

10:34.224 --> 10:36.959
I'm accustomed to living in
a nice house in Lincoln Park,

10:36.994 --> 10:39.629
a house I can't afford on my CPD salary.

10:39.663 --> 10:40.930
Okay.

10:40.964 --> 10:43.166
My dad is very wealthy.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.535
Investment banker wealthy.

10:45.569 --> 10:47.203
<i>Cover of Forbes wealthy.</i>

10:47.237 --> 10:49.672
Really?

10:49.706 --> 10:52.175
I'm his older single daughter
who's never been married.

10:52.209 --> 10:53.276
We do this dance every year

10:53.310 --> 10:55.011
where I bring my new fiancé to dinner

10:55.045 --> 10:56.846
and tell him I'm sure this is the one.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.016
He then writes me a check
and tells me he's proud of me.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.318
We're both just going through
the motions at this point,

11:02.352 --> 11:04.887
but he's old-fashioned,

11:04.922 --> 11:06.722
and I don't want to think
about what would happen

11:06.757 --> 11:07.723
if I don't play the game.

11:07.758 --> 11:09.091
All right, say no more.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.426
I get it. I do.

11:10.461 --> 11:13.296
It's just I... you think
he's going to buy this?

11:13.330 --> 11:14.564
Why wouldn't he?

11:14.598 --> 11:16.766
Well, the, uh...

11:16.800 --> 11:18.101
the age difference.

11:20.604 --> 11:23.005
Exactly how old do you think I am?

11:25.509 --> 11:27.009
I have no idea.

11:28.912 --> 11:30.646
Friday.

11:30.681 --> 11:31.948
Dress nicely.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.649
Okay.

11:37.187 --> 11:39.288
You need a moment?

11:39.323 --> 11:40.690
All right, come on.

11:40.724 --> 11:42.392
Perko's about to walk from the hospital.

11:42.426 --> 11:43.860
Hank wants us to keep an eye on him.

11:43.894 --> 11:45.428
Anywhere's better than here.

11:47.765 --> 11:49.198
This is where Novak holes up.

11:49.233 --> 11:51.334
Instead of the bank taking
over, the Two-Threes did.

11:51.368 --> 11:53.402
Which makes no warrant necessary.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.103
Chicago P.D.!

12:27.137 --> 12:29.038
Bodies!

12:29.072 --> 12:31.741
Cover!

12:31.775 --> 12:32.742
I got the door on the left.

12:32.776 --> 12:34.410
Go!

12:34.445 --> 12:36.846
I've got three more!

12:36.880 --> 12:39.615
- Clear!
- Clear!

12:39.650 --> 12:40.650
Clear!

12:42.820 --> 12:43.853
Clear!

12:53.583 --> 12:56.051
Well, found a couple of these.

12:56.085 --> 12:58.387
If there was money here, it's gone now.

12:58.421 --> 13:00.856
Maybe somebody wanted a bigger
piece of the pie for himself.

13:00.890 --> 13:02.557
Three of these men have Two-Threes' ink.

13:02.592 --> 13:05.527
Look at this guy.

13:05.561 --> 13:08.397
- He ain't Croatian.
- San Judas Tadeo.

13:08.431 --> 13:09.865
He's a big narcosaint in Colombia.

13:09.899 --> 13:11.133
That's right.

13:11.167 --> 13:12.634
So we've got two different types of rounds.

13:12.668 --> 13:13.802
We've got the nine mils from the pistols,

13:13.836 --> 13:15.871
and then I dug a couple
slugs out of the wall.

13:15.905 --> 13:17.239
I think that' a .22 hollow point.

13:17.273 --> 13:19.341
It's an assassin's bullet.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.743
10 to 1 he came in with
a Colombian hit squad,

13:21.778 --> 13:23.545
caught two in the chest,

13:23.579 --> 13:25.013
and his amigos left him where he fell.

13:25.048 --> 13:27.015
So run Mr. Bogota's prints.

13:27.050 --> 13:28.850
See if we find anything at all.

13:28.885 --> 13:31.053
We need a name.

13:32.455 --> 13:33.422
He picks up his coffee,

13:33.456 --> 13:34.423
goes to the pharmacy,

13:34.457 --> 13:35.791
picks up the dry cleaning.

13:35.825 --> 13:38.260
Tailing Perko was a complete wank, Al.

13:38.294 --> 13:40.095
That is till it isn't.

13:40.129 --> 13:43.732
That is meaningless.

13:43.766 --> 13:46.268
So what'd you decide about Wendy?

13:46.302 --> 13:48.704
Oh, I'm just takin' it one
day at a time, you know?

13:48.738 --> 13:50.172
No, I don't know.

13:50.206 --> 13:51.173
Not really.

13:51.207 --> 13:52.274
Hey, I got to ask you.

13:52.308 --> 13:53.942
Sergeant Platt, is she out of the closet?

13:56.112 --> 13:57.546
I make it my mission to know as little

13:57.580 --> 13:58.714
about that woman as possible.

14:00.116 --> 14:02.551
She's making me be her
beard to meet her father.

14:02.585 --> 14:04.553
I get it, you don't want
your dad to know you're gay.

14:04.587 --> 14:05.554
That's fine.

14:05.588 --> 14:07.856
I just don't get it with her.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.360
High school friend of mine, Travis White.

14:11.394 --> 14:14.129
Hell of a football player.

14:14.163 --> 14:16.365
Full ride at Notre Dame, the works.

14:16.399 --> 14:20.235
But gay as the day is
long, and everybody knew it.

14:20.269 --> 14:22.070
Now, rather than come out to his parents,

14:22.105 --> 14:23.939
he moves to Korea with his boyfriend.

14:23.973 --> 14:27.409
Now, he comes back once a
year but tells his parents

14:27.443 --> 14:30.112
that his girlfriend out
there is afraid of flying.

14:30.146 --> 14:31.113
Korea.

14:31.147 --> 14:33.181
Now... and his parents are nice.

14:37.420 --> 14:38.820
Look at this guy.

14:43.426 --> 14:46.762
Man, anything for a buck, huh?

14:46.796 --> 14:47.863
Hey!

14:47.897 --> 14:49.164
Get away from the car, would you?

14:49.198 --> 14:50.165
What the...

14:51.200 --> 14:52.167
What the hell?

14:56.539 --> 14:58.340
Hey!

14:58.374 --> 15:01.843
I got the squeegee guy.

15:01.878 --> 15:06.014
Stop!

15:06.049 --> 15:10.318
Get down, get down!

15:10.353 --> 15:12.154
Hang in there, buddy.

15:18.261 --> 15:20.195
Stop!

15:20.229 --> 15:21.697
Chicago P.D.! Out of the way!

15:21.731 --> 15:25.734
Go, go, go!

15:31.641 --> 15:34.042
Son of a bitch.

15:37.914 --> 15:40.482
Bastard had a car waiting.

15:40.516 --> 15:41.483
How's this guy?

15:41.517 --> 15:43.585
Not good.

15:43.620 --> 15:44.920
Jeez.

15:48.257 --> 15:49.558
It's gasoline.

15:53.229 --> 15:55.564
The Colombians are going
scorched earth on this.

15:55.598 --> 15:57.332
Literally.

15:57.367 --> 15:59.334
I think they were hoping
to torch this guy in his car

15:59.369 --> 16:00.569
along with everything with him.

16:00.603 --> 16:02.004
But I managed to put out the flames

16:02.038 --> 16:03.572
before his cell phone was destroyed.

16:03.606 --> 16:04.706
I'll take that.

16:04.741 --> 16:06.274
I thought you said you believed Perko.

16:06.309 --> 16:08.577
About the Croatian gang, yeah.

16:08.611 --> 16:10.912
But this Colombian thing,
I don't know how it adds up.

16:10.947 --> 16:12.381
I got a theory.

16:12.415 --> 16:15.183
Perko knows about the $8 million coming in,

16:15.218 --> 16:17.519
decides it's time to set
up his retirement fund.

16:17.553 --> 16:20.389
Hires his old Croatian
friends to come and take it.

16:20.423 --> 16:21.656
Only problem is,

16:21.691 --> 16:23.859
the Colombians found out and
decided to rob the robbers.

16:23.893 --> 16:26.461
Okay, but how did the Colombians find out?

16:26.496 --> 16:29.998
Perko's cell had the same
number call it the last 11 times.

16:30.033 --> 16:32.134
Call the state, line up a judge.

16:32.168 --> 16:33.935
You start writing up a
warrant for that phone.

16:33.970 --> 16:35.470
Don't need to.

16:35.505 --> 16:37.639
The calls all came from
inside Stateville prison.

16:47.650 --> 16:49.151
Unless you guys are my new attorneys,

16:49.185 --> 16:50.152
I got nothing to say.

16:50.186 --> 16:51.853
Your brother is dead.

16:51.888 --> 16:54.156
He was lit up like a barbecue grill

16:54.190 --> 16:55.791
in the middle of 18th Street.

16:58.161 --> 16:59.127
I don't believe you.

16:59.162 --> 17:00.896
Colombians did it.

17:00.930 --> 17:05.434
The $8 million is gone, baby, gone.

17:05.468 --> 17:07.402
Robbery was your idea, yeah?

17:07.436 --> 17:09.171
Your brother told you
about where he worked,

17:09.204 --> 17:11.373
what he did, 'cause you two were close.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.175
You connected him with the Two-Threes,

17:13.209 --> 17:15.477
who you sold drugs for
prior to getting locked up.

17:19.281 --> 17:20.248
Colombians?

17:20.282 --> 17:21.717
Yeah.

17:21.751 --> 17:24.086
They're killing anyone and
everyone involved in this plan.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.887
So you need to tell us what deal you made

17:25.922 --> 17:27.356
to double-cross your brother,

17:27.390 --> 17:30.292
or we're gonna charge you
federally for all ten murders,

17:30.326 --> 17:32.461
and then I get to hear
my two favorite words...

17:32.495 --> 17:34.863
Wait, listen, wait, here it comes:

17:34.897 --> 17:36.932
"Death penalty."

17:36.966 --> 17:38.500
You gotta get me a new cell.

17:38.534 --> 17:39.835
Move me out of that block.

17:39.869 --> 17:42.037
Whoa, you want to negotiate,

17:42.071 --> 17:43.372
then you got to give us something.

17:43.406 --> 17:44.973
No, you don't understand.

17:45.008 --> 17:47.042
My cellmate is Colombian.

17:47.076 --> 17:49.511
He's a big time killer
with the Latin Kings.

17:57.153 --> 17:58.654
He must've heard me talking.

18:00.390 --> 18:05.761
His name is Miguel Ortega.

18:05.795 --> 18:09.164
I didn't double-cross Lukas.

18:09.198 --> 18:10.198
I loved him.

18:14.470 --> 18:15.771
You gotta help me.

18:23.780 --> 18:26.214
The prisoner's name is Miguel Ortega.

18:26.249 --> 18:29.351
- Convict number 452-8512.
- Okay.

18:29.385 --> 18:31.553
I need the name and address
of every person he's called,

18:31.587 --> 18:34.389
visited, or sent mail to the last 72 hours.

18:34.424 --> 18:36.425
I'm on it.

18:36.459 --> 18:40.562
We gonna move Dominik Perko to a new cell?

18:40.596 --> 18:42.931
He made his bed.

18:42.966 --> 18:43.965
Let him bleed in it.

18:50.493 --> 18:51.928
Score one for the home team.

18:52.396 --> 18:54.429
Miguel Ortega's been visited nine times

18:54.464 --> 18:56.265
and made four phone calls to his main man

18:56.299 --> 18:58.834
in the Latin Kings, Rolo Ramirez.

18:58.868 --> 19:00.769
And these are his active lieutenants.

19:00.803 --> 19:01.770
Whoa. Whoa.

19:01.804 --> 19:02.771
That's the homeless guy.

19:02.805 --> 19:04.773
- The torcher.
- This guy? You sure?

19:04.807 --> 19:05.774
I'm certain, boss.

19:05.808 --> 19:06.942
You're the Latin Kings.

19:06.976 --> 19:08.543
You rob the robbers, get away with 8 mill.

19:08.578 --> 19:09.878
Why waste Perko?

19:09.913 --> 19:11.680
Well, you wouldn't do it
unless he knew something

19:11.714 --> 19:12.748
he wasn't supposed to.

19:12.782 --> 19:14.082
But he was tied to the Croatians,

19:14.117 --> 19:15.350
not the Colombians.

19:15.385 --> 19:18.487
What's the nationality
of the name Gonzalez?

19:18.521 --> 19:19.655
It's not Croatian.

19:31.234 --> 19:32.701
Hi, we have an appointment.

19:32.735 --> 19:34.303
Why don't you step outside for a second?

19:34.337 --> 19:35.304
Come on.

19:35.338 --> 19:39.041
Come on, it's okay.

19:39.075 --> 19:40.876
Hey, I was gonna call...

19:40.910 --> 19:43.545
You been working here, what, three weeks?

19:43.580 --> 19:44.546
Something like that.

19:44.581 --> 19:46.582
Where's Rolo Ramirez?

19:49.219 --> 19:52.421
You notice what we did
with the camera, right?

19:52.455 --> 19:53.689
And bad things happen

19:53.723 --> 19:57.359
when security cameras
are rendered ineffective,

19:57.393 --> 19:58.527
wouldn't you say?

20:00.163 --> 20:02.664
I...

20:02.699 --> 20:03.665
I...

20:03.700 --> 20:05.367
bro...

20:05.401 --> 20:07.336
We know Ramirez put you in this job

20:07.370 --> 20:08.370
after the Latin Kings

20:08.404 --> 20:11.006
caught wind of the robbery plans.

20:13.843 --> 20:15.077
Have a seat.

20:23.052 --> 20:26.388
You want to help yourself, now's the time.

20:26.422 --> 20:29.091
Otherwise, we leave that
camera facing the wall...

20:32.495 --> 20:34.763
and whatever happens, happens.

20:34.797 --> 20:36.532
Okay, I don't know where he is,

20:36.566 --> 20:39.134
but I know how to get to him.

20:39.168 --> 20:42.304
Rolo, he likes to use high-end whores.

20:42.338 --> 20:44.006
White chicks.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.173
He uses a call service.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.742
Which one?

20:46.776 --> 20:50.479
Zen Dolls.

20:50.513 --> 20:53.081
Rolo just ordered two hookers.

20:53.116 --> 20:56.418
They get picked up and
dropped off at a location,

20:56.452 --> 20:58.487
so we're going to put a cop
in with one of their whores.

20:58.521 --> 20:59.488
That means...

20:59.522 --> 21:00.522
I'll do it.

21:06.429 --> 21:08.497
Okay.

21:08.531 --> 21:09.731
Go get dressed.

21:09.806 --> 21:11.073
The rest of us suit up

21:11.107 --> 21:12.074
and get ready for the meet.

21:12.108 --> 21:13.108
Let's go.

21:15.845 --> 21:17.446
She beat you to the punch, huh?

21:17.480 --> 21:19.014
If she wants to step up, let her step up.

21:19.048 --> 21:21.617
You just didn't want anybody
seeing you in a skirt.

21:21.651 --> 21:23.785
I'm not sure anyone would enjoy that.

21:23.820 --> 21:25.420
Oh, no, well, that's not really true.

21:27.423 --> 21:28.757
You know, I mean,

21:28.791 --> 21:31.326
'cause you're just always
so self-deprecating.

21:35.031 --> 21:36.932
I've got stuff to do.

21:40.570 --> 21:42.037
She's green.

21:42.071 --> 21:44.239
I don't think we should just
put her in with random skank.

21:44.274 --> 21:45.240
You said Zen Dolls, right?

21:45.275 --> 21:46.241
That's right.

21:46.276 --> 21:48.443
I know somebody who works there.

21:48.478 --> 21:49.478
Or did.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.513
All right, set it up.

22:00.927 --> 22:02.394
You know you don't have to do this.

22:08.134 --> 22:10.702
I want to prove myself to Voight.

22:10.737 --> 22:12.537
I got to take big swings.

22:12.572 --> 22:14.573
Now, you of all people
know that to be true.

22:16.776 --> 22:18.877
Just...

22:18.911 --> 22:20.278
cover my ass.

22:25.551 --> 22:26.518
Covered.

22:29.722 --> 22:30.689
What time's the pick up?

22:30.723 --> 22:32.224
15 minutes.

22:32.258 --> 22:33.225
All right.

22:37.063 --> 22:40.298
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.667
You sure you're up for this?

22:41.701 --> 22:42.668
Yeah.

22:42.702 --> 22:43.669
All right.

22:43.703 --> 22:45.237
You just need to get our officer inside.

22:45.271 --> 22:47.139
And as soon as she I.D.s Rolo Ramirez,

22:47.173 --> 22:48.440
she'll signal us in.

22:48.474 --> 22:50.442
Get in a corner and make
yourself small, all right?

22:50.476 --> 22:51.743
Okay.

22:51.778 --> 22:53.645
Hey.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.581
I'm really sorry I let you down before.

22:56.616 --> 22:59.117
Fresh start, right here, right now.

22:59.152 --> 23:00.485
- Okay?
- Yeah.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.721
Come on.

23:02.755 --> 23:04.489
- Guy's this is Nadia.
- Hey.

23:04.524 --> 23:05.657
- That's Kim.
- Hi.

23:05.692 --> 23:07.392
Thanks for coming.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.694
Nice to meet you.

23:26.946 --> 23:28.747
Your daddy ever touch
you when you were a kid?

23:31.317 --> 23:32.617
What?

23:39.292 --> 23:43.161
Turn the light off in your eyes.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.844
Yeah.

23:58.878 --> 23:59.845
We're ready.

23:59.879 --> 24:01.380
Wait a second.

24:02.715 --> 24:04.483
The wire's glitching.
I'm gonna need an hour.

24:04.517 --> 24:05.984
We don't have an hour, Jin.

24:06.019 --> 24:07.252
No, it's fine.

24:07.287 --> 24:08.487
We don't need it.

24:08.521 --> 24:11.923
I get eyes on Ramirez, I'll call you.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.662
All right, let's do it.

24:16.696 --> 24:18.530
You heard the lady.

25:12.565 --> 25:13.565
Look at that.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.833
A real gentleman.

25:22.442 --> 25:23.542
Hey.

25:27.614 --> 25:29.314
Sit down.

25:29.349 --> 25:30.816
Sit down!

25:37.557 --> 25:39.491
What the hell is this?

25:39.525 --> 25:41.593
Rolo ordered some girls.

25:41.628 --> 25:42.594
Rolo ain't here.

25:42.629 --> 25:47.199
Not yet.

25:47.233 --> 25:49.134
Get up!

25:49.168 --> 25:50.135
I'm not talking to you!

25:50.169 --> 25:51.436
Sit down!

25:58.144 --> 26:00.112
Do a rail.

26:00.146 --> 26:02.848
What's that, baby?

26:02.882 --> 26:04.616
Do a rail of coke.

26:04.651 --> 26:06.818
Nah, see, me and Lacy,
we don't that anymore.

26:06.853 --> 26:07.853
- We're clean.
- Yeah.

26:09.656 --> 26:10.856
Man, they don't want the coke,

26:10.890 --> 26:11.857
they don't want it.

26:11.891 --> 26:13.192
Why waste it on these bitches?

26:13.226 --> 26:15.294
If they don't want it,
what if they're narcs!

26:15.328 --> 26:17.963
Hey, hey, papi, it's a party.

26:17.997 --> 26:19.131
We're just gonna party, okay?

26:19.165 --> 26:20.132
I got it.

26:20.166 --> 26:21.133
It's cool.

26:21.167 --> 26:23.168
I'll do it, all right?

26:30.743 --> 26:32.210
Damn. Damn. Damn.

26:35.014 --> 26:37.849
Maybe I'll let you ride this
D before Rolo gets here, huh?

26:37.884 --> 26:38.850
Whatever you want, baby.

26:38.885 --> 26:39.851
Whatever you want.

26:39.886 --> 26:40.753
Let's go.

26:40.787 --> 26:43.222
Yo, yo, yo.

26:43.256 --> 26:44.939
What's good? You startin'
the party without me or what?

26:44.959 --> 26:46.293
'Sup, Rolo?

26:46.327 --> 26:47.928
You mind if I take this
one for a test drive?

26:49.082 --> 26:50.048
Yeah, go ahead.

26:50.083 --> 26:54.787
- Let's go.
- Uh, I need my purse.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.088
Oh, yeah, baby, you got a condom?

26:56.122 --> 26:57.089
I don't think so.

26:58.124 --> 26:59.625
Then I need my purse.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.627
- Here you go, baby.
- Thanks, darlin'.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.328
Hey, where you goin'? Sit down.

27:03.363 --> 27:04.730
The party's right here, baby.

27:26.853 --> 27:27.920
Rolo's here.

27:27.954 --> 27:29.555
Five others in the front, one in the back.

27:29.589 --> 27:30.589
Hurry.

27:44.838 --> 27:46.438
Give me five.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.344
Police!

27:52.379 --> 27:53.345
Let me see your hands!

27:53.380 --> 27:54.346
Do it now! Do it now!

27:54.381 --> 27:56.882
Let me see your hands!

27:56.916 --> 27:58.083
On the ground! On the ground!

27:58.118 --> 27:59.084
On the ground!

27:59.119 --> 28:00.152
- On the ground!
- Get down!

28:00.186 --> 28:01.487
Drop the gun!

28:01.521 --> 28:02.488
You!

28:10.897 --> 28:12.097
Help me.

28:12.132 --> 28:13.499
Drop the gun, man!

28:13.533 --> 28:17.436
Put it down!

28:17.470 --> 28:18.437
Freeze! Freeze!

28:19.472 --> 28:20.773
All right. All right. All right.

28:20.807 --> 28:22.007
Get your ass down!

28:22.042 --> 28:24.910
Give me that.

28:24.944 --> 28:25.911
Burgess!

28:29.082 --> 28:30.049
Burgess!

28:30.083 --> 28:31.083
Hey!

28:31.117 --> 28:32.251
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

28:32.285 --> 28:33.252
Are you injured?

28:33.286 --> 28:36.321
Go! Just go!

28:46.966 --> 28:47.966
Target on the move!

28:48.001 --> 28:49.435
Front of the house!

28:49.469 --> 28:50.469
Torcher, the assassin.

28:50.503 --> 28:51.870
He's fleeing south on foot!

28:55.075 --> 28:56.041
You get the car!

28:56.076 --> 28:59.978
I've got him on foot!

29:00.013 --> 29:02.915
Hey, it's okay.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.917
It's okay. It's okay.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.419
- I had to.
- I know.

29:07.454 --> 29:08.420
But I was clean.

29:10.056 --> 29:11.290
Sorry.

29:11.324 --> 29:14.026
I'm sorry.

29:14.060 --> 29:15.194
Shh.

29:25.071 --> 29:27.139
Stop!

29:35.415 --> 29:38.417
<i>Fuera de aqui!</i>

30:11.451 --> 30:15.287
You okay?

30:15.321 --> 30:16.722
All patrols, suspect's out on foot

30:16.756 --> 30:18.590
fleeing 2600 South Albany.

30:23.029 --> 30:25.064
Unit 2119 on South Albany.

30:25.098 --> 30:26.298
No sign of suspect.

30:26.333 --> 30:27.733
Looks like one of us got away.

30:27.767 --> 30:28.934
Shut up.

30:31.404 --> 30:32.605
Burgess, you all right?

30:32.639 --> 30:34.039
Yes, sir.

30:36.009 --> 30:37.509
Get up.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.144
Get up!

30:39.179 --> 30:40.379
Hmm?

30:42.615 --> 30:44.383
Disposal.

30:47.687 --> 30:48.654
Get her out of here.

30:48.688 --> 30:50.189
Everybody out of the house!

30:55.061 --> 30:56.228
Look at me.

30:56.262 --> 30:57.262
Look at me.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.901
Where's the $8 million?

31:02.936 --> 31:03.902
It's up your ass.

31:03.937 --> 31:05.738
- It is?
- Yeah.

31:07.974 --> 31:09.808
You right-handed or left-handed?

31:09.843 --> 31:11.410
Ask your mother, huh?

31:13.580 --> 31:16.615
Look, uh, I don't know you, bro,

31:16.649 --> 31:19.018
but you should know me.

31:19.052 --> 31:20.019
I'm Hank Voight.

31:20.053 --> 31:25.057
I don't make idle threats.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.860
You're going to tell me
where the $8 million is,

31:27.894 --> 31:29.862
or we're going to put
your hand down that sink.

31:29.896 --> 31:30.863
Then your feet.

31:30.897 --> 31:32.765
I'll put your whole damn face.

31:32.799 --> 31:35.768
Do you hear me? I look like I'm bluffin'?

31:35.802 --> 31:37.169
Huh?

31:39.439 --> 31:40.639
Tell me where the eight is.

31:41.708 --> 31:42.942
Tell me where the eight is!

31:46.346 --> 31:47.313
Okay!

31:47.347 --> 31:49.682
Okay! Okay! Okay!

32:25.987 --> 32:28.355
Ooh.

32:33.427 --> 32:35.262
I think that's more than I make a year.

32:35.296 --> 32:36.496
Who called Internal Affairs?

32:39.934 --> 32:42.035
Yeah, I'd be curious to know that myself.

32:45.506 --> 32:47.307
Give us a minute.

32:52.480 --> 32:56.283
Want to count it?

32:56.317 --> 32:59.786
You know the banks are
insured for every penny.

32:59.820 --> 33:01.187
And?

33:01.222 --> 33:04.291
When we first met, you said
this was gonna be a partnership.

33:06.794 --> 33:09.729
There's a lot of different
kinds of partnerships.

33:09.764 --> 33:11.731
7.9 million different kinds.

33:13.367 --> 33:16.303
Or 7.8.

33:16.337 --> 33:18.872
Any kind you want there to
be, I'll bet you could find it.

33:26.948 --> 33:28.248
Voucher it.

33:29.617 --> 33:31.418
Every penny.

33:37.124 --> 33:38.425
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:38.459 --> 33:41.094
You did well, Burgess.

33:41.128 --> 33:42.429
Thank you, Detective.

33:44.165 --> 33:46.199
Pow!

33:46.233 --> 33:48.268
Don't let Lindsay see you do that.

33:48.302 --> 33:49.569
Okay.

34:01.148 --> 34:02.249
What happened to your face?

34:02.283 --> 34:04.284
I went three rounds with a pit bull.

34:04.318 --> 34:05.919
Right.

34:05.953 --> 34:07.320
Well, this'll be interesting.

34:07.355 --> 34:08.355
I'll drive.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.194
And I'm sitting in the airport,

34:14.228 --> 34:18.831
and he says to me, "do you know
anything about pipe fixtures?"

34:18.866 --> 34:21.668
I say, "a little."

34:21.702 --> 34:24.070
So now he looks at me sideways.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.106
"I guess I should," I say.

34:26.139 --> 34:29.509
"I put all the pipes into the sears tower.

34:29.543 --> 34:32.379
Yeah, yeah, I know a
little bit about pipes."

34:33.947 --> 34:38.251
So he says, "yeah, I guess you do."

34:38.286 --> 34:40.654
And he offers me to come work for him.

34:40.688 --> 34:43.857
And that's very generous, you know.

34:43.891 --> 34:49.362
But I say, "Mr. Carson,
I'm doing just fine."

34:49.397 --> 34:51.297
Maybe you should come to work to for me."

34:57.571 --> 35:00.106
How do you like that steak, Adam?

35:00.141 --> 35:01.474
Damn good, sir.

35:01.509 --> 35:02.476
Robert.

35:02.510 --> 35:03.476
Robert, please.

35:03.511 --> 35:06.146
Robert.

35:06.180 --> 35:09.849
So you and Trudy met at work?

35:09.884 --> 35:11.618
We did, yeah.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.353
That how you got those bruises?

35:14.722 --> 35:16.256
Just serving and protecting, Robert.

35:19.026 --> 35:20.860
Let me ask you something, Adam.

35:20.895 --> 35:22.395
Go right ahead.

35:23.631 --> 35:25.732
What do you like most
about my daughter Trudy?

35:26.767 --> 35:28.835
Dad.

35:31.572 --> 35:35.041
Well, I would have to
say that I like the fact

35:35.076 --> 35:37.043
that she knows exactly who she is.

35:37.078 --> 35:38.645
That she doesn't take crap from anybody,

35:38.679 --> 35:39.646
and I mean anybody.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.348
She's a...

35:41.382 --> 35:43.883
she's just a...

35:43.918 --> 35:45.552
she's a tough cookie, my little cookie.

35:49.123 --> 35:50.090
Probably like you, sir.

35:56.063 --> 35:57.063
Well, that's fine.

35:59.300 --> 36:00.767
That is...

36:00.801 --> 36:01.801
just fine.

36:03.871 --> 36:05.972
To Trudy.

36:06.007 --> 36:07.140
Thank you.

36:09.343 --> 36:10.310
To you, baby.

36:11.345 --> 36:12.545
Ah, that's good.

36:15.650 --> 36:16.616
Thank you.

36:16.651 --> 36:17.951
You're having seconds.

36:17.985 --> 36:19.452
That's an order.

36:19.487 --> 36:20.520
Gail, I'm full.

36:20.554 --> 36:22.756
You look like you're wasting away.

36:22.790 --> 36:25.425
You can't tell this woman, no, Jay.

36:25.459 --> 36:26.893
You should've learned that by now.

36:26.928 --> 36:29.129
The only way I could lose
weight was to move away.

36:29.163 --> 36:31.364
Yeah, don't think I didn't
notice you hardly ate.

36:31.399 --> 36:32.799
I had a full plate.

36:32.833 --> 36:34.134
Does anyone want more wine?

36:34.168 --> 36:35.835
Yes, thank you.

36:37.772 --> 36:39.372
You should see that one.

36:39.407 --> 36:42.943
He was out in the shed
today, building new cabinets.

36:42.977 --> 36:45.478
I haven't seen him out there
in I don't know how long.

36:46.781 --> 36:47.814
That's great.

36:47.848 --> 36:50.850
Gail, where'd you put the cork screw?

36:50.885 --> 36:52.886
Coming.

36:55.189 --> 36:56.389
Thanks for coming.

36:56.424 --> 36:58.825
They light up when they see you.

36:58.859 --> 37:01.761
It's my pleasure.

37:01.796 --> 37:04.564
So when do you go back?

37:04.599 --> 37:07.901
Tomorrow.

37:07.935 --> 37:11.504
Do you know what I found?

37:11.539 --> 37:13.240
A picture of you two from prom.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.608
Oh, God.

37:16.010 --> 37:17.377
Ah, I always thought the two of you

37:17.411 --> 37:18.478
should've made a go of it.

37:18.512 --> 37:19.479
Mom!

37:19.514 --> 37:20.480
What?

37:20.515 --> 37:22.782
Just pour the wine.

37:22.817 --> 37:26.319
Why don't you move back, Allie?

37:26.354 --> 37:29.656
Phoenix has nothing for you.

37:29.690 --> 37:31.858
Your family is here.

37:31.892 --> 37:36.229
Yeah, Allie, why don't you move back?

37:36.264 --> 37:40.166
Maybe I will.

37:44.038 --> 37:45.105
Where are you parked?

37:45.139 --> 37:46.339
It's this Ford pick-up right over here.

37:50.444 --> 37:51.478
Well, thanks for that.

37:51.512 --> 37:52.979
No, I had a good time.

37:53.014 --> 37:55.081
You know, thank you for inviting me.

37:55.116 --> 37:57.117
Your dad, he seems...
you know, he seems great.

37:57.151 --> 37:59.519
He's a blowhard.

37:59.554 --> 38:01.288
But he's not too bad
once you get to know him.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.290
Hey, you seal the deal?

38:03.324 --> 38:04.291
He gave me an envelope.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.325
I haven't looked at it yet.

38:05.359 --> 38:07.394
I gotta ask you something, Sarge.

38:07.428 --> 38:09.863
Why haven't you told him you're gay?

38:09.897 --> 38:10.864
Gay?

38:10.898 --> 38:12.265
Yeah, I just... I think...

38:12.300 --> 38:13.934
and I know I'm speaking out of school here,

38:13.968 --> 38:15.669
but I think he'd be cool with it.

38:15.703 --> 38:16.670
He seem like a...

38:16.704 --> 38:17.871
I'm not gay.

38:17.905 --> 38:19.172
What?

38:19.207 --> 38:23.476
I did half the guys in
my class in the academy.

38:23.511 --> 38:26.646
Just because I haven't
found someone worth a damn

38:26.681 --> 38:27.647
to settle down with,

38:27.682 --> 38:28.915
that doesn't mean...

38:28.950 --> 38:30.517
- Wow.
- Oh, okay.

38:30.551 --> 38:31.518
This is...

38:31.552 --> 38:32.652
Yeah.

38:32.687 --> 38:33.720
You're damn right it is.

38:33.754 --> 38:35.755
I'm so sorry.

38:35.790 --> 38:37.557
Just forget I said anything, Sarge.

38:37.592 --> 38:38.959
Forget I said that.

38:38.993 --> 38:40.961
Yeah, I'll forget to say
anything to your fiancée

38:40.995 --> 38:42.395
about you shacking up with Burgess.

38:42.430 --> 38:43.396
We didn't...

38:43.431 --> 38:45.031
Yeah, but you want to.

38:45.066 --> 38:47.868
Wait. Wait. Wait.

38:47.902 --> 38:48.902
Okay.

38:51.706 --> 38:52.672
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:52.707 --> 38:55.108
No, I'll see you tomorrow.

38:55.142 --> 38:57.143
Yeah.

39:06.187 --> 39:07.220
You ready?

39:11.192 --> 39:12.826
Let's do it together.

39:12.860 --> 39:14.261
Yeah?

39:35.616 --> 39:38.552
I'll check on you every day.

39:38.586 --> 39:40.220
Okay.

39:40.254 --> 39:42.055
Come on.

40:08.149 --> 40:09.683
Found this in my desk.

40:16.023 --> 40:17.290
What was she like?

40:19.227 --> 40:23.029
She was a pain in the ass.

40:23.064 --> 40:28.568
Her coffee order was the most
complicated in the district.

40:28.603 --> 40:30.403
Took her longer to describe
it than to drink it.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.374
But she was damn good police.

40:34.408 --> 40:36.810
Slept like a baby every night.

40:38.546 --> 40:41.114
Mind if I keep it?

40:41.149 --> 40:43.717
Yeah, I do.

40:43.751 --> 40:45.619
Detective?

40:45.653 --> 40:46.987
Join me in Voight's office.

41:10.044 --> 41:11.845
What's up?

41:11.879 --> 41:15.515
Nice job on that Rolo Ramirez thing.

41:15.550 --> 41:17.417
Unfortunately, you left a big loose end.

41:22.657 --> 41:24.291
Muñoz. He's your torcher, right?

41:24.325 --> 41:25.425
That's him.

41:25.459 --> 41:26.960
We'll get him. I got eyes everywhere.

41:26.994 --> 41:29.229
If we turn up the heat on every
street corner, there'll be...

41:29.263 --> 41:30.630
- Belden's already on it.
- Belden?

41:30.665 --> 41:31.631
This is our case.

41:31.666 --> 41:32.933
He convinced the Deputy Chief

41:32.967 --> 41:35.535
that Gustav Muñoz here is the same assassin

41:35.570 --> 41:37.838
that took out those priests
over in Lawndale two weeks ago.

41:37.872 --> 41:38.838
So?

41:38.873 --> 41:41.208
So it's his case, and now
the Colombian's his problem.

41:41.292 --> 41:43.460
Oh, and we're supposed to
cooperate in every way we can.

41:43.494 --> 41:45.262
I wish that was it.

41:48.599 --> 41:50.133
You remember Pulpo, right?

41:53.871 --> 41:57.274
He kidnapped my son.
And he killed Willhite.

41:57.308 --> 41:59.776
Well, Belden wants to
draw out the Colombians.

41:59.811 --> 42:03.280
He's pulling Pulpo off
MCC and using him as bait.

42:03.314 --> 42:04.614
They're letting him out?

42:04.649 --> 42:06.550
Went over my head.

42:10.388 --> 42:12.089
It's already been approved.
