00:22.600 --> 00:24.500
It's like this.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.000
We live in claustrophobia,
a land of steel and concrete,

00:30.300 --> 00:33.400
trapped by dark waters.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.600
There is no escape,
nor do we want it.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.900
We've come to thrive on it
and each other.

00:43.300 --> 00:47.600
You can't get the adrenaline pumping
without the terror.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.300
I love this town.

03:40.700 --> 03:45.400
You've been listening to WGAZ,
the electricity of Manhattan.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.900
This request goes out
to Crystal Lake,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.100
to the senior class of Lakeview High.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.800
That's us!

03:51.900 --> 03:55.100
They'll be graduating
on the 13th of this month

03:55.300 --> 03:58.100
and we wish them the best of luck
and success

03:58.200 --> 04:01.700
when they come to visit
our seductive city.

04:01.800 --> 04:06.300
Our lure is a great one,
young friends, but beware -

04:06.500 --> 04:10.200
the city of lights
casts many shadows indeed.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.800
- I love you.
- I love you.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.700
Got to throw the anchor over.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.500
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.700
Come on, Jimmy,
something's bothering you.

05:12.700 --> 05:17.100
We're near that summer camp
where all those murders took place.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.400
- What murders?
- You don't want to know.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.600
- Tell me.
- Forget about it, Suzi.

05:25.800 --> 05:29.300
The guy's dead now,
somewhere at the bottom of this lake,

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
if you believe the stories.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.600
What stories?

05:35.400 --> 05:38.800
There was this boy
named Jason Voorhees.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.300
He drowned in Crystal Lake
about 30 years ago.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.500
None of the counsellors heard him.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.300
Help!

05:47.300 --> 05:50.600
A bunch of years went by,
everyone forgot about it

05:50.800 --> 05:53.600
and that's when the murders started.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.900
Jason did it?

05:57.100 --> 06:00.600
His mother blamed the counsellors
for her son's death

06:00.900 --> 06:03.200
and she tried to kill them all

06:03.300 --> 06:06.100
but she got her head chopped off
by one of them.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.700
Legend has it that Jason came back
to get even,

06:12.900 --> 06:16.600
vowing to kill every teenager
in the area.

06:16.900 --> 06:21.300
And every now and then,
the murders just start up.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.600
Forget about it,
they're just stories.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.500
CRYSTAL LAKE CAMP.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.700
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

07:06.900 --> 07:09.300
Come on, I'm serious.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.300
All right, I'll go check it out.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.700
Jim?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.500
Stop screwing around. I mean it.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.500
Got you good, Suzi.

08:36.600 --> 08:41.299
All right, so I'm a major ass.

08:41.600 --> 08:45.400
- You'll never do it again?
- Never again.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.700
- Forgive me?
- No.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.800
Jason?

11:10.300 --> 11:12.900
No. Please, no!

11:55.000 --> 11:57.400
Toby's gone awful quiet back there.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.600
Yeah, I guess he's a little nervous
about the trip.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.700
Here.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.200
Go on, open it.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.400
Stephen King supposedly used it
in high school.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.400
I don't know what to say.

12:25.600 --> 12:30.200
Rennie, you are the best student
I have ever had.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.200
You have a real gift.

12:33.300 --> 12:37.200
If there's anybody that can
make use of that pen, it's you.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.700
- Charles.
- Colleen.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.800
This cruise was your idea

13:11.000 --> 13:14.300
so at the very least
you could show up on time.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.700
- Has everyone checked in?
- No.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.900
Jim Miller and Suzi Donaldson
never showed up

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and I'm very concerned.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.500
They probably decided to explore
each other rather than New York.

13:27.700 --> 13:31.700
That's nice. We're running
five minutes late already.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.100
There's someone else coming, too.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.800
You never should've brought her.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.200
It's up to Rennie to decide
what she wants to do.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.800
She doesn't know. She never had
a stable life till she lived with me.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.400
She certainly doesn't have one now.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.700
I'm her legal guardian,
not you or anybody else

14:14.900 --> 14:18.200
and I know what's best for her.
End of discussion.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.300
I think it's just the beginning.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.100
Have you decided on
your departure protocol?

14:30.300 --> 14:33.300
I thought I'd leave that honour
to my son.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
That's not necessary.

14:37.700 --> 14:41.000
Relinquishing command
of the motor vessel Lazarus

14:41.100 --> 14:43.300
to Captain Sean Robertson.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.200
But before you take the helm,
take this.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.100
Something old and something new.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.900
I used that sextant
when I was your age.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.100
Now those goddamn computers
do all the work for you.

15:06.200 --> 15:10.200
Have you decided on
a plan of departure, Captain?

15:23.600 --> 15:27.100
How about we start up the engines
and come around 180 degrees?

15:28.600 --> 15:31.400
Aren't you forgetting something?

15:42.200 --> 15:45.200
Send out
the international maritime signal,

15:45.300 --> 15:47.300
followed by a broadcast

15:47.500 --> 15:50.100
warning other ships
that we are underway.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.700
This voyage is doomed.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.200
Tell me about it.

16:34.300 --> 16:38.600
- Have fun in New York!
- Bye!

16:53.700 --> 16:56.800
LAKEVIEW GRAD CRUISE.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.700
- Rennie.
- Hi, Sean.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.300
I heard you weren't coming.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.400
We changed our minds.

17:38.300 --> 17:41.400
- I got you a present.
- But I didn't get you one.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.700
Forget it.
It's a dumb little thing anyway.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.900
I love it.

17:57.100 --> 18:01.900
I thought when we got there we
could hike to the top of the statue,

18:02.100 --> 18:04.100
if you felt like it.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.900
It's supposed to be 22 storeys tall.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
That sounds wonderful.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.100
Mr Robertson,
your father was looking for you.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.500
I guess I'll see you later.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.700
What are you doing here?
We've already been through all this.

18:29.900 --> 18:34.000
I'm sorry, Uncle Charles.
Please don't be upset with me.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.500
I'm not upset, I'm just concerned.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.400
Is this axe awesome or what?

19:16.200 --> 19:20.400
Too cool, JJ.
Your parents really came through.

19:20.600 --> 19:24.300
No lie. I hear there's
this big power room downstairs,

19:24.500 --> 19:27.000
we can get supreme
concert hall echo.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.500
Come down and shoot a basement
tape.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.300
I've got to get some
shockumentary footage first.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.400
Oh, man! Don't tell me you're still
trying to scam on Tamara?

19:41.400 --> 19:44.100
How long have we known each other?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.600
Don't be a dweeb, Wayne.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.900
She's only interested in
what you can do for her.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.300
She is a user.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
She's sexy.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.500
So what? So's this guitar.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.100
I'll talk to you later, all right?

20:21.900 --> 20:25.300
There's a big storm
predicted for tonight.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.300
You're making a big mistake.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.100
It's not too late
to put you back on shore.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.900
If Miss Van Deusen
knew how afraid...

20:37.100 --> 20:39.500
She didn't push me into this.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.500
Why are you doing this to yourself?

20:45.700 --> 20:48.000
I don't even know what I'm afraid of.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.700
I can't even remember
when it started.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.700
Don't you think it's time I found out
and got over it?

20:58.800 --> 21:02.100
Facing your fear
doesn't always conquer it.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.800
I'm staying.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.000
OK.

21:16.500 --> 21:20.000
Man, this place
is aching for a video!

21:21.200 --> 21:23.200
Wayne, you're an asshole.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.900
So what do you think?

22:32.000 --> 22:36.200
Time for some personal experiences
to fuel our minds?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.900
I agree.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.200
Mommy?

23:52.600 --> 23:55.600
Help! Help me!

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
Toby!

24:25.200 --> 24:28.000
Is that a muscular bod or what?

24:58.200 --> 25:01.200
He's undefeated, you know that?

25:01.400 --> 25:05.300
Julius is the only senior
I'd even consider doing it with.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.000
He is so good-Iooking.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.700
Gorgeous guy at 10 o'clock.
Look sensual.

25:30.300 --> 25:33.300
I think it's time
for some recreational activity.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.200
Have you seen my niece?

25:42.400 --> 25:45.900
She's motorvating downstairs,
what's the problem?

25:46.100 --> 25:50.200
Senior predictions has started
and she hasn't shown up.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.200
Maybe some of us
don't want our futures predicted.

25:54.500 --> 25:57.100
In your case, I'm sure that's true.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.700
Night-time is the right time.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.700
- No thanks.
- Don't be a lightweight.

26:16.900 --> 26:21.300
If we get caught,
I could lose my science scholarship.

26:21.500 --> 26:26.000
You're talking to the prom queen.
Would I risk getting caught?

26:37.500 --> 26:41.100
- Jesus!
- Have you guys seen my dog?

26:41.400 --> 26:45.700
No, we haven't.
Would you care for a hit?

26:47.400 --> 26:49.400
No thanks.

26:51.500 --> 26:55.500
Real space cadet.
Wonder if she'll nark on us?

27:01.300 --> 27:03.400
Here, boy!

27:16.500 --> 27:18.800
GAMES ROOM LAZARUS.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.000
Ready to party and then some.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.200
- What are you doing in here?
- Nothing.

27:51.300 --> 27:54.800
Are you girls using drugs?

27:55.000 --> 27:58.200
Do you think I would use drugs,
Mr McCulloch?

27:58.300 --> 28:00.700
We were just exploring the ship.

28:04.600 --> 28:08.700
I'll be coming to your room
in exactly 15 minutes, Miss Mason.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.200
Have your biology project ready
or I'll be phoning your parents.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.800
They're out of town.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.400
I'll make sure that you remain
on board

28:22.500 --> 28:26.300
while your classmates
are out seeing the sights.

28:33.300 --> 28:36.200
- Now what?
- Relax.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.800
I've got McCulloch covered.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.600
That narking bitch niece of his
is a different matter.

28:43.800 --> 28:47.800
Rumour has it she's a teensy bit
afraid of the water.

29:36.100 --> 29:40.500
Nice fight, Julius. I need to work
on my left-right-left combo.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.600
Listen, no hard feelings, OK?

29:47.700 --> 29:50.600
What do you say we track down
those babes?

30:22.900 --> 30:26.800
- So, are you having fun yet?
- Yeah, a lot.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Come on, level with me.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.300
If you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

30:46.100 --> 30:48.100
It was an accident, I swear.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.900
Stay calm
and grab the life preserver!

31:33.200 --> 31:35.500
I've got you. Come on.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
That was truly excellent.

31:43.100 --> 31:47.000
- Let's check out the waiters.
- I think I'll pass.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.100
- What?
- See you later.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.000
Some friend you are.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.600
Come on, grab her hand!

31:57.700 --> 31:59.900
It's OK. Sit down.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.200
Grab her some towels.

32:06.300 --> 32:10.000
She's fine,
just go back to what you were doing.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.600
Care to talk about it?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.900
I can't swim.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.100
No kidding.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.700
Have you thought about
taking lessons?

32:25.800 --> 32:27.800
It's not that simple.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Good God!

32:32.200 --> 32:34.100
Take it easy, she's all right.

32:34.200 --> 32:38.300
You've done wonderful job
supervising the kids. What happened?

32:38.600 --> 32:42.600
- It wasn't her fault.
- Give me those towels.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.000
You stay away from her. Both of you!

32:49.500 --> 32:53.700
He's come back
and you're all gonna die.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.100
Just leave me alone!

33:32.100 --> 33:34.100
Help!

33:53.600 --> 33:55.800
The door's open.

33:56.900 --> 34:00.300
I'm in no mood for any more
of your stall tactics.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.700
Where is your final project?

34:06.200 --> 34:10.699
Wouldn't you like
a glass of champagne first, Charles?

34:10.900 --> 34:13.100
Where did you get this?

34:13.300 --> 34:16.100
I packed it just for us.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.199
That's it.

34:19.199 --> 34:22.699
You're not stepping off this ship
until we return home.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.800
I haven't even shown you
my biology project.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.500
What do you think you're doing?

34:45.600 --> 34:48.199
You stop that!

34:50.800 --> 34:52.800
I mean, really.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.699
Take a closer look, Charles.

34:56.900 --> 35:00.900
I want to make sure I've labelled
all my organs correctly.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.200
Get off of me! I don't believe this.

35:23.500 --> 35:27.800
What do you think you're doing?
I'm your teacher.

35:29.300 --> 35:32.000
Not only are you going home

35:32.100 --> 35:37.500
but I will see to it that you spend
next year back in high school.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.800
What is going on?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.400
- Get anything good?
- Very kinky.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.400
- Give me that tape!
- Come and get it.

35:53.700 --> 35:57.200
You're going to be very, very sorry,
young lady.

35:57.400 --> 36:02.200
And as for you, you can forget about
attending any film school.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.400
Ever!

36:08.400 --> 36:11.800
Relax, he's not going to risk
trying a thing.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.200
I guess you're right.

36:20.200 --> 36:25.600
Listen, this is going to sound
supremely lame and I know it

36:25.900 --> 36:29.700
but I've had the major hots for you
since our sophomore year.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.300
That's so sweet, Wayne.

36:40.500 --> 36:44.000
And I really would love
to stay and chat

36:44.300 --> 36:46.600
but I really am pressed for time.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.200
- Let's get together later.
- I just thought...

36:50.300 --> 36:52.300
Maybe we could...

36:55.500 --> 36:58.900
Wayne, you're an asshole.

39:12.800 --> 39:16.500
Let's kick in the stabilizers,
keep the seas off the quarter.

39:16.700 --> 39:17.900
Yes, sir.

39:18.100 --> 39:21.400
These kids are in for
one hell of a storm.

39:36.100 --> 39:40.100
- How old's your boy now?
- 19 months.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.600
Tremendous age.

39:45.700 --> 39:49.000
Take some advice.
Don't push him too hard.

39:54.900 --> 39:58.300
- Take the helm, Jim.
- Certainly, sir.

40:38.300 --> 40:41.800
I'd double-check
those lifeboat stations, too.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.800
My God!

41:12.000 --> 41:15.700
- Can you take us home?
- I'll the Coast Guard for you.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.900
What about you? Are you staying
here?

41:21.400 --> 41:24.200
I'm never going to be
what he wants me to be,

41:24.500 --> 41:26.800
so I guess I'm going with you.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.800
Jesus!

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Dad?

41:56.900 --> 42:01.200
Attention everybody.
This is Sean Robertson.

42:01.500 --> 42:05.800
Have you seen JJ? She was supposed
to be down in the power room.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.300
This is an emergency.
Everybody come to the bridge.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.300
What the fuck is this?

42:16.800 --> 42:18.200
Mayday.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.100
Shit.

42:25.100 --> 42:28.100
This is the motor vessel Lazarus.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.900
What's going on?

42:33.500 --> 42:37.500
- Jesus Christ.
- Can anybody out there hear me?

42:43.100 --> 42:44.700
Thank God.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.300
Hello?

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Are you there?

42:55.100 --> 42:57.400
I demand to know what is going on!

42:58.600 --> 43:00.600
Christ.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.900
Where's the radio?

43:13.400 --> 43:15.500
It's dead.

43:16.700 --> 43:19.900
You're all gonna die.

43:20.200 --> 43:23.800
You're the last ones.
He's come back for you.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.600
- What are you talking about?
- Jason Voorhees.

43:27.800 --> 43:31.800
You're insane!
He's been dead for years.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.800
He came down the river
and he got on board.

43:35.800 --> 43:38.400
He walks this ship here and now.

43:38.500 --> 43:42.700
Yes, a killer walks this ship.
And it's certainly none of us!

43:43.000 --> 43:45.100
- Bastard!
- What are you doing?

43:45.300 --> 43:47.600
You're the one who's insane.

43:51.100 --> 43:55.500
That lunatic has been talking about
Jason ever since he came aboard.

43:55.700 --> 43:59.400
- It's no coincidence.
- It doesn't prove he's the one.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.700
Walking corpses are not real.

44:05.300 --> 44:08.200
These dead bodies are real enough.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.800
I say we regroup

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
and go find this motherfucker
before he finds us!

44:15.100 --> 44:17.700
- Are you with me?
- Watch your mouth!

44:17.800 --> 44:20.700
You'll do no such thing.
I'm in charge here!

44:25.000 --> 44:28.600
School is out, McCulloch. OK?

44:31.600 --> 44:33.600
Let's go.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.300
You come back here!

44:44.100 --> 44:46.500
Christ. Where's Rennie?

44:50.800 --> 44:52.400
She's dropping the anchors.

46:01.600 --> 46:05.700
- You had me worried to death!
- Sean said to drop the anchors.

46:05.900 --> 46:08.300
I'm the one
you should be listening to.

46:08.500 --> 46:13.600
Do you think dropping an anchor
in the middle of a storm makes sense?

46:14.900 --> 46:16.700
Come on.

46:19.400 --> 46:23.800
Tamara?
Did you hear the announcement?

48:43.700 --> 48:47.800
We managed to scrounge this up
in game rooms and hallways.

48:48.100 --> 48:50.700
All right, grab what you want.

48:52.500 --> 48:55.400
- What are you taking, Julius?
- Nothing...

49:01.500 --> 49:03.600
...but this gun.

49:16.800 --> 49:19.000
JJ?

49:21.700 --> 49:23.700
Are you down here?

50:02.700 --> 50:05.300
You got a major problem, Wayne.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.700
Shit, I can't see a damn thing.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.100
Did you find Rennie?

51:57.300 --> 52:00.300
She's safe in her room,
no thanks to you.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.400
Have you brought her
back on course yet?

52:03.500 --> 52:05.600
He's doing the best he can.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.400
He's the son of a captain.

52:08.600 --> 52:12.900
He ought to be able to operate
this thing. Do something!

52:45.800 --> 52:47.800
It worked.

52:47.900 --> 52:50.200
- We're back on course.
- Good!

52:54.800 --> 52:57.400
- What's that?
- The fire alarm.

53:04.400 --> 53:08.400
We thought about that. Nobody could
see a flare gun in this storm.

53:08.700 --> 53:11.100
Only one person needs to see it.

53:11.200 --> 53:13.200
I'm gonna find that deck hand.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.600
But what about the fire?

53:15.800 --> 53:18.300
- How do we know there really is one?
- What?

53:18.400 --> 53:20.400
Use some common sense.

53:20.600 --> 53:22.900
Setting off
a fire alarm causes panic,

53:23.000 --> 53:28.900
the same panic caused by suggesting
Jason is alive and on this ship.

53:29.200 --> 53:31.200
Enough is enough.

55:31.400 --> 55:33.400
Help me!

56:22.600 --> 56:25.800
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.300
- What is that?
- The power room.

56:39.800 --> 56:44.100
Listen. I want you to stay here
until I get back with the others.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.200
Understand?

58:04.100 --> 58:06.700
Water's got into the engine circuit.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.400
ENGINE ROOM.

58:19.600 --> 58:22.700
We have to get everybody
off the ship!

58:25.500 --> 58:28.400
Quick! Dive!

58:55.700 --> 58:57.900
What the hell? Let go of her!

58:58.100 --> 59:01.500
She shouldn't be on this ship!
It's all your fault!

59:01.600 --> 59:04.700
- It's Jason's fault.
- Not another word, you hear?

59:04.900 --> 59:07.400
No, I don't!

59:07.600 --> 59:11.300
You listen to me
if you want off this ship alive.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.700
Thank God.
I just lowered the lifeboat.

59:18.800 --> 59:21.000
We have to go.

59:21.100 --> 59:24.100
Wait! I left the others
in the restaurant.

59:24.400 --> 59:26.300
There is no more restaurant.

59:28.300 --> 59:30.300
Come on.

59:37.100 --> 59:39.300
Get back!

59:41.900 --> 59:44.300
Son of a bitch!

59:53.100 --> 59:55.000
Come on.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.600
Hurry up!

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.300
Start rowing!

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.400
Come on!

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.300
Keep rowing!

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.700
I hope you can find shore soon,
Captain.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.600
We don't want to drown out here.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.600
Do you have any idea where we are,
Sean?

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.400
Come on, man. I made it, so can you.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.600
All right, man.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.200
Hey, man. Wake up!

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.200
Shit! Check it out!

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.400
Damn! We're in New York! You did it!

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.800
We are in New York! New York City!

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.800
I don't believe it, we made it!

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.900
There must be a phone around here.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.100
Wonderful choice of places
to dock a boat, Mr Robertson.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.600
Wonderful.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.100
- I can't believe we made it.
- Or that we're alive.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.200
We are all very lucky.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.600
- Give me your money.
- Give him the money. Now!

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.400
Here.

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.400
Got some good shit here.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.900
You got that right.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.400
Give me your wallet.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:50.500
- Ain't that sweet.
- Bastard!

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.900
Go ahead Superman, be a hero.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.400
- Come on, now.
- Got a problem, Dad?

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:13.700
- Please don't hurt her.
- Miss Princess?

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.100
Would I do that?

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.300
You look like a real party girl.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.000
Want to go on a date
with me and my friend?

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.700
If you're free, that is.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:34.000
Follow us,
we'll blow her fucking head off.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.200
Are we just going to stand here?
Let's go.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:43.900
Julius! Calm down, will you?
You heard him, they'll kill her!

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.500
We have to find the police!

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:53.700
I think it'll be more productive
if we split up.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.000
No discussions now, please!

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.100
Help! Stop it! Somebody help me!

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.400
Shut the fuck up!

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.200
Welcome to the Casbah, princess.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.300
Please, don't hurt me.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:46.200
Loosen up, baby. You'll feel
way better if you're stoned.

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.900
Better sling her some more caine.
We only got a half load here.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.500
We're in for a long night.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:16.200
It's your parade, princess.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.600
It can be smooth, it can be rough.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.700
It's your choice.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.200
Come on, baby. Lay back and enjoy it.

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.000
I think I'm in love.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.600
Forgot my money, homes.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.899
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.300
You're dead, fuckhead.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.500
Come on. Operator, this is
an emergency, get me the police.

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:59.300
Use the combos, keep the feet light.
This is it.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.600
Take your best shot.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.800
Motherfucker.

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.400
- What did they do to you?
- He's here.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.800
Jason is here.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.400
We have to find the others now.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.800
- Freeze!
- It's OK, she's with me.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.800
My apologies, miss.
Are you all right?

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.500
Thank God.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.600
Are you OK?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.100
Mr McCulloch,
Jason is here in New York.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.600
- Rennie saw him.
- Just shut up about Jason.

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.000
Is it true?

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.500
I find it a tall tale indeed
but you seem honest

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.900
so I kind of believe
some of what you say.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.500
First we need to find Julius.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.800
I'm sure he'll pop up.
I'll call for back-up.

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.100
Dispatch!

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.900
Hold it! What are you doing?

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.900
For God's sake, Rennie, slow down!

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.500
Quickly! Let's move!

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.300
Miss Van Deusen!

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.800
It's so pretty today.

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.500
Perfect day for swimming.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.900
You've been coming out here
every summer for three years

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.000
and you still haven't learned
how to swim.

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:31.700
I'll take some lessons this time.
I promise.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.200
That's what you said last year.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.900
I think the time has come
for your first swimming lesson.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.100
You don't want to end up drowning
like that Voorhees boy, do you?

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.800
He never learned how to swim, either.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.300
He's still in the bottom
of this lake.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.300
- He is not.
- He is.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:04.500
And he's ready to pull down
anybody who falls in and can't swim.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.900
You're telling a lie.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.600
Am I? Let's find out.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:21.200
Better swim, Rennie,
before Jason pulls you down.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.400
- I can't!
- You can and you will!

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.200
Come on! Swim!

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:15.000
You pushed me into the lake.

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:22.500
I was only trying to teach you.

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.100
You almost killed me.
I was drowning!

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.100
I pulled you out, I saved your life!

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.100
You son of a bitch!

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.100
I was at school when they told me.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.400
Rennie, your parents died
in a car accident.

01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:00.500
It seems like
everybody I care about I lose.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.000
That won't happen this time.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.000

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.600

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:54.200
There's a payphone in back
but it's broke.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:58.900
Look, you don't understand,
a maniac is trying to kill us.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.400

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:31.300
- Can you help us get out?
- We haven't got a man to spare.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.000
- What do you mean?
- Toxic waste.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:38.800
The sewer floods with the stuff
at midnight, ten minutes from now.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.700
Follow me.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.800
You didn't get me in the lake

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.900
