00:02.252 --> 00:04.170
male announcer: ON THE LAST
EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:04.254 --> 00:09.300
TEN RIVAL ARTISTS WERE FIGHTING
TO SETTLE THE SCORE.

00:09.384 --> 00:14.264
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,
JASON'S ANXIETY TOOK A TOLL.

00:14.347 --> 00:15.849
- YOU ALL RIGHT, JASON?

00:15.932 --> 00:18.017
- I AM SO FREAKING STRESSED
OUT OF MY MIND

00:18.101 --> 00:18.893
THAT I CAN'T EVEN
THINK STRAIGHT.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.229
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO TALK.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.648
- IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HIS ANXIETY
IS GETTING TO HIM AGAIN.

00:23.732 --> 00:24.774
YOU WANT TO BE INK MASTER?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.944
NOT GONNA HAPPEN THIS WAY,
BUDDY.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.654
announcer:
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

00:29.738 --> 00:33.908
INTERLOCKING TATTOOS
CAUSED MAJOR BLOWUPS.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.410
- THIS TATTOO'S
A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.287
ON ONE HAND, I WANT A TEAMMATE
THAT I CAN LINE UP A TATTOO,

00:37.370 --> 00:40.123
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I WANT SOMEBODY THAT I CAN BEAT.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.792
- IT BLOWS MY [bleep] MIND
HOW ARROGANT YOU ARE.

00:42.876 --> 00:43.918
- JUST BE A LITTLE BIT
MORE HUMBLE.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.879
- HE [bleep] YOU OVER, JULIA.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.672
- THAT'S REALISTIC.
- HE MANIPULATED YOU.

00:47.756 --> 00:48.465
- HEY, JOSH, GUESS WHAT.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.676
[bleep] YOU.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.555
announcer: IN THE ELIMINATION,
JULIA, AARON, AND JASON

00:55.638 --> 00:57.390
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.558
- AARON.

00:58.641 --> 01:01.102
- IT HAS TO BE
COMPLETELY LEGIBLE.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.145
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.062
- JASON.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.397
- JAPANESE BEING YOUR SPECIALTY,

01:04.480 --> 01:05.190
AND THE FACT THAT IT'S HARD
TO READ

01:05.272 --> 01:07.066
AND HARD TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON,

01:07.150 --> 01:07.984
IT'S TROUBLING FOR ME.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.486
- I'M HERE TO BE THE INK MASTER.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.654
- YOU LOST THIS BATTLE TO
SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T DO THIS.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.572
- JULIA.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.698
- TODAY, YOU FELL SHORT.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.200
THE SHADING IN THE FACE,

01:15.283 --> 01:16.159
THE CROOKED EYE,
THE WEIRD TEETH--

01:16.242 --> 01:19.037
- THIS IS NOT THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.122
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS SAYING

01:21.206 --> 01:23.500
AT THIS MOMENT.

01:23.583 --> 01:27.337
- JULIA, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.302
announcer: NINE ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:34.385 --> 01:37.806
BUT ONLY ONE WILL EARN
A $100,000 PRIZE

01:37.889 --> 01:41.684
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.662
- AH.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.747
- GOOD LUCK, SIR.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.207
- WHO'S IT GONNA BE?

02:49.377 --> 02:51.754
LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.756
- MAN, IT JUST MADE ME SICK
THAT I WAS DOWN THERE.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.883
- NOT FUN.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.175
- THINK THE RIGHT PERSON
WENT HOME?

02:56.259 --> 02:57.343
- THAT WOULD BE THE QUESTION.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.596
- YOU THINK WHAT?
I DON'T GET--

02:59.679 --> 03:01.556
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.516
HE [bleep] YOU OVER, JULIA.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.020
YOU SET HER UP WITH THIS
REALISM PORTRAIT BULL[bleep].

03:07.103 --> 03:09.063
- THAT'S REALISTIC.
- HE MANIPULATED YOU.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.064
- ANYBODY THAT SAYS PEOPLE
ARE MANIPULATING EACH OTHER,

03:10.148 --> 03:12.942
[bleep] TRYING TO DO
THIS STUPID GAME PLAY

03:13.026 --> 03:13.943
OR SOME WEIRD [bleep],

03:14.027 --> 03:15.445
IS ALL [bleep] UP
IN THEIR OWN HEAD,

03:15.528 --> 03:17.196
AND THEY HAVE NO [bleep] IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

03:17.280 --> 03:17.780
- YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO WIN,

03:17.864 --> 03:20.617
AND THAT'S OBVIOUS.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.077
- YEAH, SO WHY DON'T YOU CHOOSE
THE HARDEST THING TO TATTOO?

03:23.161 --> 03:25.288
- IS THERE ANY TATTOO
THAT YOU THINK THAT JULIA

03:25.371 --> 03:27.206
COULD'VE DONE AGAINST ME
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE HAD

03:27.290 --> 03:29.709
ANY [bleep] CHANCE
OF BEATING ME ON?

03:29.792 --> 03:30.668
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.879
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE [bleep] HOLES

03:32.962 --> 03:34.797
YOU POKE WITH A TATTOO NEEDLE.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.257
YOU TRY TO PASS IT ON
TO SOMEBODY ELSE,

03:36.341 --> 03:37.508
YOU'RE JUST AN IDIOT.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.719
WE ARE EACH HERE, NOT TO [bleep]
RUB EACH OTHERS' BACKS,

03:39.802 --> 03:41.679
BUT TO GET THAT MONEY.

03:55.610 --> 03:59.155
- THIS IS A FAR CRY
FROM THE CITY.

03:59.238 --> 04:02.158
- THAT SMELLS LIKE [bleep].
- WELCOME.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.869
WE STARTED THIS COMPETITION
WITH 18 ARTISTS,

04:04.953 --> 04:07.413
AND NOW,
ONLY HALF OF YOU REMAIN.

04:07.497 --> 04:11.000
BUT IN THE END, ONLY ONE OF YOU
WILL WALK AWAY WITH $100,000

04:11.084 --> 04:13.628
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

04:13.711 --> 04:14.128
THIS WEEK,

04:14.212 --> 04:17.005
WE'RE TESTING...

04:17.089 --> 04:18.757
GRADATION.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.719
{\an8}- GRADATION IS A SMOOTH
TRANSITION FROM DARK TO LIGHT.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.304
IF YOUR TRANSITIONS
AND YOUR GRADATIONS

04:23.388 --> 04:26.349
ARE SMOOTH AND CRISP,
YOUR TATTOO'S GONNA LOOK BETTER.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.308
- BEFORE THE MODERN CONVENIENCE

04:27.392 --> 04:30.144
OF TATTOO INK IN ANY COLOR
WAS AVAILABLE,

04:30.228 --> 04:32.522
TATTOO ARTISTS
HAD TO MAKE THEIR OWN INKS

04:32.605 --> 04:34.190
OUT OF NATURAL MATERIALS
THEY COULD EASILY FIND,

04:34.274 --> 04:36.359
SUCH AS ASH, PLANTS,
AND MINERALS.

04:36.442 --> 04:40.530
TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE--
YOU MUST MIX YOUR OWN INK

04:40.613 --> 04:43.908
USING ONE MAIN,
NATURAL INGREDIENT...

04:45.994 --> 04:48.121
BLOOD.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.038
{\an8}- [bleep]

04:49.122 --> 04:50.498
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO
PAINT WITH BLOOD.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.916
{\an8}THAT'S DISGUSTING.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.585
- THIS IS [bleep] CRAZY.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.046
- YOU EACH HAVE A 6-FOOT
BY 8-FOOT CANVAS,

04:57.130 --> 04:59.674
AND YOUR DESIGN
MUST SHOW GRADATION.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.427
USING CARBON AND GYPSUM,
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DARKEN

05:02.510 --> 05:04.887
AND LIGHTEN THE BLOOD,
CREATING GRADATIONS.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.056
THE WINNER OF THE FLASH
CHALLENGE WILL HAVE THE POWER

05:07.140 --> 05:10.727
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.020
YOU HAVE THREE HOURS,

05:12.103 --> 05:15.314
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.404
- NOTHING WEIRD
ABOUT THIS AT ALL.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.574
{\an7}- DOING THESE PAINTINGS IN BLOOD
IS A GREAT TEST FOR GRADATION,

05:24.657 --> 05:27.160
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU JUST HAVE
THE ONE TONE TO WORK WITH.

05:27.243 --> 05:30.913
- [gags, coughs]
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS SO GROSS.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.041
- OH, IT'S SO GOOEY.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.585
- YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO GET A SMOOTH GRADATION

05:35.668 --> 05:37.211
FROM DARK TO LIGHT.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.505
- PIG BLOOD?

05:41.674 --> 05:43.509
- BUCKETS AND BUCKETS OF BLOOD.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.636
- PIG BLOOD'S BETTER
THAN PIG [bleep].

05:45.720 --> 05:46.721
LOOK AT ERIC.

05:46.804 --> 05:47.430
- TRYING TO SHOW ME UP
OVER THERE, ERIC?

05:47.513 --> 05:50.058
- YOU JUST MAKE LIKE A DRAWER.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.769
{\an8}- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE ONLY
THREE HOURS, THE BIGGER YOU GO,

05:52.852 --> 05:54.645
{\an8}THE EASIER IT IS
TO SHOW GRADATION.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.397
MY PLAN OF ATTACK

05:56.481 --> 05:59.233
IS TO DO A JAPANESE DRAGON
GETTING LOST IN THE CLOUDS.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.401
I'M REALLY GONNA GO FOR IT.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.198
- [coughs]
GOD.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.491
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JOSH?

06:06.574 --> 06:08.785
DIDN'T YOU STUDY BLOOD PAINTING
AT HARVARD OR SOMETHING?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.287
{\an8}- I SEE OTHER PEOPLE JUST
GOING STRAIGHT FOR THEIR CANVAS

06:11.370 --> 06:12.330
{\an8}WITH THE PAINT BRUSH,

06:12.413 --> 06:14.999
{\an8}AND I FEEL LIKE
YOU NEED TO PLAN FIRST.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.959
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE
TO OUTSHINE

06:17.043 --> 06:20.046
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE FOOLS
THE ENTIRE TIME I'M HERE.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.385
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
TWO HOURS REMAINING.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.305
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU [bleep]
GET THIS THAT SMOOTH.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.474
- YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE?
- HELL, NO.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.059
{\an8}I'M ON THE UPSWING,
AND NOTHING CAN STOP ME NOW.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.560
YOU SEE MY IMAGE NOW, RIGHT?

06:34.644 --> 06:36.437
THE HAMMER HEAD'S GONNA HAVE
BLOOD COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.607
I'VE DEDICATED 20 YEARS
OF MY LIFE TO TATTOOING.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.442
GROWING UP,
I FELT LIKE I WAS AN OUTCAST.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.318
THEN, WHEN I MET
ALL THE TATTOO ARTISTS,

06:42.401 --> 06:44.570
I KNEW THAT WAS
WHAT I NEEDED TO BE.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.657
{\an1}IF I DON'T WIN, IT'D BE LIKE I
LET DOWN MY WHOLE TATTOO FAMILY.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.658
I'M READY TO DO THIS.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.538
- YOU CAN SMELL THE DEATH.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.497
- SMELL OF BLOOD
SMELLS LIKE MONEY TO ME.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.417
- SMELLS LIKE $100,000.
- YEAH, IT DOES.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.377
- IT'S ACTUALLY COMING OUT GOOD.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.088
{\an8}- CRIS,
YOU'VE GOT THIS BIG ASS CANVAS,

07:02.171 --> 07:04.924
{\an8}AND ALL YOU'RE DOING IS USING
A TINY LITTLE SPACE ON IT?

07:07.176 --> 07:09.428
IT'S A COP OUT.
- 30 MINUTES TO GO.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.017
I CAN'T PAINT
WITH THIS GODDAMNED BLOOD.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.603
{\an8}MY GRADIENTS ARE CRAP.

07:18.271 --> 07:23.151
YEP, [bleep] THIS [bleep].

07:23.234 --> 07:24.193
[bleep] PISSES ME OFF.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.903
COVERED IN [bleep] PIG BLOOD,

07:25.987 --> 07:29.198
LIKE, I'M JUST GONNA
MAKE A [bleep] MESS

07:29.282 --> 07:31.200
AND FEEL A LOT BETTER ABOUT IT.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.952
DON'T [bleep] CARE.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.204
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.498
{\an8}- NOTHING MAKES ME HAPPIER
THAN KNOWING THAT EMILY

07:37.582 --> 07:38.708
{\an8}HAS GONE COMPLETELY INSANE.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.711
- YEAH, TODAY, WE'LL BE
TESTING YOUR CRAZY BITCH SKILLS.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.922
- YOU WANT TO COME
A LITTLE CLOSER AND SAY THAT?

07:45.006 --> 07:49.218
- THIS LUNATIC IS NOT GOING
TO THE END.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.761
- FIVE MINUTES, GUYS.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.890
- LOOKS LIKE ERIC WENT A LITTLE
CRAZY WITH HIS DRAGON.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.225
{\an8}- DOING SUCH A LARGE DESIGN
IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME,

07:56.309 --> 07:59.061
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY SCREWED.

07:59.145 --> 08:04.400
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE.

08:04.483 --> 08:05.401
THAT'S IT.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.528
NO MORE PAINTING.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.988
- WHAT A MESS.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.573
LOOKING AT EVERYBODY ELSE'S,
THERE'S NO COMPARISON THERE.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.367
{\an8}I THINK I GOT THIS
FLASH CHALLENGE IN THE BAG.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.535
MY DESIGN LOOKS AWESOME.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.582
- JOSH.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.292
- YOU'VE GOT SOME NICE DARKS
IN THE CENTER OF THE ROSE,

08:21.375 --> 08:24.003
BUT ELSEWHERE, YOU ARE A LITTLE
LACKLUSTER WITH THE SHADING.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.297
THE LINE WORK
AND EVERYTHING IS VERY LEGIBLE.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.757
I SEE A FEW DIFFERENT TONES,

08:27.840 --> 08:30.801
BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE A LOT
OF GRADATION BETWEEN THE TONING.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.678
- JASON.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.388
- ACTUALLY
SHOWING THE CENTER DARK

08:34.472 --> 08:36.097
AND THEN RADIATING OUT
TO THE LIGHT, IT'S A NICE TOUCH.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.517
YOU DID SHOW SOME GRADATION.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.479
I WISH YOUR LINES WERE A LITTLE
BIT SMOOTHER LIKE JOSH'S,

08:41.562 --> 08:44.440
BUT YOUR SHADING
IS A LOT NICER THAN HIS.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.358
- DON.

08:45.441 --> 08:46.525
OVERALL, IT'S LEGIBLE.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.110
IT'S CLEAR
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE,

08:48.194 --> 08:50.947
BUT NOT A TON
OF EXAMPLES OF GRADATION.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.325
- THAT DRAWING OF THAT SKULL
LOOKS MORE LIKE A LEG OF LAMB

08:54.408 --> 08:58.454
OR A HAM HOCK OR SOMETHING
WITH SOME HORNS STUCK IN IT.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.622
- AARON.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.623
- DEFINITELY THINK THEY LOOK
LIKE TWO RIGHT PINCHERS,

09:00.706 --> 09:03.084
BUT THE GRADIENTS
YOU WERE ABLE TO CAPTURE

09:03.167 --> 09:06.712
ARE PROBABLY THE SMOOTHEST
OUT OF ANY OF THEM THAT WE SEE.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.964
- CLEEN.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.925
YOU DID A REALLY GOOD JOB
CHOOSING A BIG, DYNAMIC DESIGN,

09:11.008 --> 09:12.510
THEN SHOWING A LOT
OF DIFFERENT TONES.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.846
THERE'S A FEW GOOD EXAMPLES
OF NICE GRADIENTS IN HERE.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.848
- CRIS.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.058
THIS IS KIND OF
A LETDOWN.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.893
IT'S JUST SMALL AND REALLY DARK.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.311
THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF DETAIL IN IT.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.064
IT'S A VERY ROUGH,
SKETCHY IMAGE.

09:25.147 --> 09:25.856
- EMILY.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.816
- WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS DRAWING?

09:26.899 --> 09:29.277
- IN ALL HONESTY,
I GOT [bleep] PISSED OFF,

09:29.360 --> 09:30.653
AND I WAS FRUSTRATED,

09:30.736 --> 09:33.281
SO I JUST STARTED
GRABBING HANDFULS OF BLOOD

09:33.364 --> 09:34.156
AND THROWING IT ON THERE.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.742
- IT'S A STRANGE DESIGN.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.577
THE FLOWERS ARE PRETTY BAD.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.205
THE LINE WORK IN THE SHAPE
OF THE BANNER IS PRETTY BAD.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.374
I'M JUST NOT INTO IT.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.084
{\an8}- EMILY'S DESIGN SUCKS.

09:45.167 --> 09:49.338
{\an8}IT'S AN ANGRY, UGLY IMAGE.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.215
- SO, ERIC, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.342
- EVERY TIME,
I PUT THE BLOOD ON TOO LIGHT.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.677
IT WOULD JUST KEEP DISAPPEARING.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.178
I KEPT BUILDING, BUILDING,
BUILDING,

09:56.262 --> 09:57.763
AND DIDN'T GET TO FINISH.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.931
- IT'S A COOL LOOKING DRAGON.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.016
I WISH YOU COULD'VE
GOTTEN MORE DONE.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.434
- SO DO I.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.352
- ONE THING I WILL SAY TO YOU,
THOUGH, BEST DRAGON HEAD

10:03.436 --> 10:05.104
WE'VE SEEN IN INK MASTER SO FAR.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.355
- THAT SAYS A LOT.
I APPRECIATE IT.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.523
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:07.606 --> 10:09.275
HE DIDN'T EVEN FINISH
THE DAMN THING.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.777
{\an8}THIS IS BULL[bleep].

10:11.861 --> 10:13.946
- MARK.
- A LOT OF DIFFERENT TEXTURES.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.282
I LOVE THE SPLATTER TEXTURE
ACROSS THE TOP.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.700
IN THE WATER AND IN THE SHARK,

10:17.783 --> 10:20.077
THERE'S A LOT
OF DARK AND LIGHT TONES.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.954
YOU HAVE A GREAT EXAMPLE

10:22.038 --> 10:24.498
OF WHAT THIS CHALLENGE
IS GOING FOR--GRADIENTS.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.169
- TODAY, OUR ARTISTS
ARE PAINTING USING BLOOD

10:28.252 --> 10:29.337
TO SHOW GRADATION.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.255
MARK DID A REALLY NICE,
BIG PIECE.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.256
- IT'S A BIG, DYNAMIC IMAGE.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.716
HE USED THE WHOLE CANVAS.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.178
A LOT OF DIFFERENT TEXTURES
GIVE THE WHOLE IMAGE CONTRAST,

10:37.261 --> 10:38.763
AND I THINK HE DID SHOW A LOT
OF GRADATION.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.931
- CLEEN DID A VERY NICE
SACRED HEART THERE.

10:41.015 --> 10:44.226
- PROBABLY SOME OF THE SMOOTHEST
GRADATION WE'VE SEEN TODAY.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.312
- IF YOU'RE A GOOD ARTIST,
YOU CAN MAKE ART ON ANYTHING,

10:46.395 --> 10:47.396
AND IT LOOKED GREAT.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.482
- WHO GAVE US SOME
OF THE WORST EXAMPLES TODAY?

10:49.565 --> 10:50.441
I KNOW THAT EMILY
IS CERTAINLY IN THE BOTTOM.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.736
- THIS IS A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE DRAWING.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.905
IT IS A DAGGER WITH NO HANDLE,

10:55.988 --> 10:58.991
AND THE WAY THE BANNER JUST
TURNS INTO A FLOWER PETAL,

10:59.075 --> 10:59.408
IT'S TOTAL CRAP.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.577
- CORRECT.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.621
- CRIS IS AN ARTIST
WHO SEEMED TO NOT

11:03.704 --> 11:05.915
SHOW A LOT OF TRANSITION
FROM DARK TO LIGHT.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.917
- WE'VE NEVER SEEN
CRIS ATTACK ANYTHING.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.044
HE DOESN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE
IN WHAT HE'S DOING,

11:10.127 --> 11:11.587
AND I THINK THAT'S NOT GOING
TO GET HIM TO THE END OF THIS.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.256
- SO I THINK THAT WE
HAVE A DECISION.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.299
- DEFINITELY.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.009
- LET'S LET THEM KNOW.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.180
TODAY,
YOU HAD TO SHOW GRADATION

11:21.263 --> 11:24.100
BY PAINTING A DESIGN IN BLOOD.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.143
SOME OF YOU MADE A MESS.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.187
- EMILY, PRETTY WEAK
FROM THE START,

11:28.270 --> 11:29.939
AND IT JUST GOT WORSE.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.816
IT'S A PITIFUL EXCUSE OF ART.

11:31.899 --> 11:32.441
- CRIS, YOU DON'T ATTACK.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.442
THIS IS YOUR TIME, MAN.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.694
YOU'RE AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE,

11:35.778 --> 11:36.654
AND YOU AND THREE OR FOUR
OTHER PEOPLE

11:36.737 --> 11:40.366
IN HERE ARE THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE GOING NEXT.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.034
THESE CHALLENGES
ARE YOUR LIFELINE.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.538
IF YOU DON'T ATTACK NOW,
YOU'RE GONNA BE GONE.

11:45.621 --> 11:49.250
- BUT SOME OF YOU
CREATED VIVID WORK.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.543
- MARK, FOR SHOWING GRADATION,

11:50.626 --> 11:52.461
YOU DEFINITELY SHOW DARKS
AND LIGHTS,

11:52.545 --> 11:55.005
WHICH HELP GIVE
AN IMAGE CONTRAST.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.925
- CLEAN, SIMPLE IMAGERY,
BUT STILL VERY STRONG.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.385
YOU KEEP DOING THINGS
AND MAKE IT TOUGH

11:59.468 --> 12:00.010
FOR PEOPLE TO RIVAL YOU.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.429
- THANK YOU.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.805
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

12:02.888 --> 12:06.475
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S FLASH
CHALLENGE IS...

12:08.519 --> 12:09.770
MARK.
- RIGHTEOUS.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.897
- YOU REALLY CAME TOGETHER
WITH A DYNAMIC PIECE.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.274
YOU OBVIOUSLY WORKED HARD
ON THIS.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.400
NICE JOB.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.111
- YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

12:17.194 --> 12:18.612
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.489
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LOST TO MARK.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.533
{\an8}I'VE BEEN THE TOP DOG
IN THIS WHOLE COMPETITION,

12:22.616 --> 12:25.077
{\an8}AND MARK'S BEEN
ONE OF THE BOTTOM FEEDERS.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.537
SO DISAPPOINTING.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.289
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
AND PREPARE TO MEET

12:28.372 --> 12:30.750
YOUR CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.001
- I GOT MY CONFIDENCE BACK.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.211
{\an8}NOW, I CAN SHOW THE JUDGES
EXACTLY WHAT I CAN DO.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.463
NOW IS MY TIME.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.550
{\an8}YOU'RE A SELF-ABSORBED
ASS[bleep].

12:39.633 --> 12:41.135
{\an8}- I DO BETTER TATTOOS THAN YOU.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.553
{\an8}- TIME FOR PAYBACK.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.847
- YOU MUST ALSO TATTOO
HEAD-TO-HEAD

12:44.930 --> 12:47.308
WITH OUR GUEST JUDGE.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.767
- I AM SCARED [bleep]LESS.
- OH, BOY.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.318
- I FEEL PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT THE CRITIQUE.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.403
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING BAD
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.905
- I MEAN,
IT'S OBVIOUSLY EASIER FOR YOU.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.239
- WELL, YEAH,
'CAUSE I'M HERE TO WIN.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.782
- I JUST SEE HOW YOU ARE
AS A COMPETITOR.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.284
- I'M A--
I'M A STRONG COMPETITOR.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.660
- YEAH,
YOU GOT A GREAT GAME 'CAUSE

13:06.744 --> 13:07.870
YOU [bleep] WITH PEOPLE
THAT HAVE WEAKNESSES.

13:07.953 --> 13:11.415
- I HAVE NOT DELIBERATELY
TRIED TO MANIPULATE

13:11.499 --> 13:12.917
ANYBODY IN THIS COMPETITION.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.043
- YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME
I SUCK SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.296
- I CALL THEM AS I SEE THEM,
SO THAT'S ALL IT IS

13:17.379 --> 13:19.507
IS YOU'RE BUTTHURT BECAUSE YOU
WANT EVERYBODY TO SAY,

13:19.590 --> 13:20.841
"OH, IT LOOKED GOOD.
IT LOOKED GOOD."

13:20.925 --> 13:22.301
- I FIGURED YOU OUT
AS A COMPETITOR.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.053
- WHAT DID YOU--
THERE WAS NOTHING TO FIGURE OUT.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.638
- THAT YOU'RE
A SELF-ABSORBED ASS[bleep]

13:25.721 --> 13:26.805
THAT [bleep] WITH EVERYONE.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.140
- OH, MY GOD.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.892
THE ONLY WAY THAT I'M [bleep]
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW IS

13:29.975 --> 13:31.977
THAT I DO BETTER TATTOOS
THAN YOU, AND YOU'RE THREATENED.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.562
- THE POINT IS NOW
I'M GOING BACK TO THE GUY

13:33.646 --> 13:34.688
I WAS BEFORE I GOT HERE,

13:34.772 --> 13:36.690
AND I'M GONNA
DO GOOD TATTOOS AGAIN.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.667
- WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S
ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:54.750 --> 13:59.296
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO SHOW US
THAT YOU DESERVE $100,000,

13:59.380 --> 14:01.090
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

14:01.173 --> 14:02.758
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.802
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING GRADATION.

14:04.885 --> 14:08.430
{\an8}- GRADATION IS GOING
FROM SUPER DARK TO SUPER LIGHT

14:08.514 --> 14:10.933
{\an8}AND HAVING A NICE,
SMOOTH TRANSITION IN BETWEEN.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.602
{\an8}- THERE IS NO BETTER TEST
OF GRADATION

14:13.686 --> 14:17.523
{\an8}THAN A BLACK AND GRAY TATTOO.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.649
{\an8}- I'M KNOWN
FOR BOLD COLOR TATTOOS,

14:18.732 --> 14:20.442
{\an8}NOT MY BLACK AND GRAY WORK.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.945
{\an8}THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.447
- IF YOUR BLACKS AREN'T DARK
ENOUGH TO SMOOTHLY TRANSITION

14:25.531 --> 14:28.784
TO LIGHT TONES,
YOU WILL NOT ACHIEVE GRADATION,

14:28.867 --> 14:32.079
AND YOUR TATTOO WILL END UP
A GRAY, UNREADABLE MESS.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.998
{\an8}- IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THAT GRADATION,

14:34.081 --> 14:35.541
{\an8}EVERYTHING JUST LOOKS THE SAME.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.918
- IN EVERY ELIMINATION TATTOO,
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE TATTOOING

14:38.002 --> 14:42.089
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH AT LEAST ONE
OTHER ARTIST.

14:42.172 --> 14:43.465
TODAY, NOT ONLY

14:43.549 --> 14:46.218
ARE YOU ALL GOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH EACH OTHER,

14:46.302 --> 14:49.471
YOU MUST ALSO TATTOO
HEAD-TO-HEAD

14:49.555 --> 14:50.556
WITH OUR GUEST JUDGE.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.809
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

14:53.892 --> 14:55.728
- MR. TOMMY MONTOYA.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.856
- OH, JESUS.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.983
- I'M KNOWN FOR PORTRAITS
IN BLACK AND GRAY.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.485
COMING HERE AS A GUEST JUDGE
AND TATTOOING--

15:03.569 --> 15:04.987
THESE ARTISTS ARE WATCHING ME.

15:05.070 --> 15:05.863
THE WORLD'S GONNA
BE WATCHING ME.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.781
{\an8}I'M GONNA REALLY
HAVE TO TURN IT UP.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.242
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?
- HEY, TOMMY.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.785
{\an8}- TO COMPETE
AGAINST TOMMY MONTOYA,

15:11.869 --> 15:13.704
{\an8}ONE OF MY HEROES, IN BLACK
AND GRAY,

15:13.787 --> 15:14.705
{\an8}IS NOT ONLY AN HONOR,

15:14.788 --> 15:16.832
{\an8}BUT I AM SCARED [bleep].

15:16.915 --> 15:19.585
- TODAY, WHILE YOU DESIGN
AND TATTOO YOUR CANVAS,

15:19.668 --> 15:24.089
TOMMY WILL ALSO DESIGN
AND TATTOO AT THE SAME TIME.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.049
- THAT'S CRAZY.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.592
- IN CRITIQUE, YOUR TATTOOS

15:26.675 --> 15:29.386
WILL BE DIRECTLY COMPARED
TO TOMMY'S TATTOO.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.221
- OH, MY GOD.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.183
{\an8}TOMMY MONTOYA
IS RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.934
I AM PANICKING.

15:36.018 --> 15:39.855
- AND YOU MUST TATTOO
ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC

15:39.938 --> 15:42.691
BLACK AND GRAY IMAGES:

15:42.775 --> 15:44.860
CHRIST ON THE CROSS.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.196
- OH.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.197
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.699
{\an8}JESUS IS SUCH
A RECOGNIZABLE IMAGE,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.993
{\an8}ANY MISTAKES ARE GONNA BE SEEN
FROM A MILE AWAY.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.036
THE ROOM FOR ERROR
JUST GOT SMALLER.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.622
- YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK, CHRIS NUÑEZ,

15:56.705 --> 15:59.708
TOMMY MONTOYA, AND MYSELF.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.710
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.921
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.216
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

16:07.299 --> 16:11.387
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM,

16:11.470 --> 16:14.098
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.642
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

16:16.725 --> 16:19.061
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.521
LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.027
THERE IS ONE CANVAS HERE
WHO'S OFF-LIMITS.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.737
WIDE RECEIVER
FOR THE NEW ORLEANS SAINTS,

16:28.821 --> 16:32.449
HE'S TOMMY'S CANVAS TODAY,

16:32.533 --> 16:35.285
MR. KENNY STILLS.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.124
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

16:40.207 --> 16:41.875
{\an8}- I'M EXCITED
TO GET TATTOOED BY TOMMY.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.087
HE'S THE MAN, AND I THINK THAT
IT'S A PERFECT PIECE FOR HIM.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.422
- THAT'S WHAT'S UP.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.507
- MARK,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

16:48.590 --> 16:52.136
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES,

16:52.219 --> 16:53.387
SO BE SURE TO LOOK OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.472
- ALL RIGHT.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.765
{\an8}ALL CLEEN'S BEEN DOING
IS WALKING AROUND,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.392
{\an8}BEING CUTTHROAT, AND TELLING
EVERYBODY THEY SUCK.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.476
IT'S TIME FOR PAYBACK.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.478
I GOT THE SKULL PICKS,
AND NOW IT'S MY TIME TO SHINE.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.063
WHERE DO YOU WANT YOUR JESUS?
- ON MY SHIN.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.857
- ARE YOU OPEN TO
SOMEBODY CHANGING YOUR MIND?

17:04.940 --> 17:05.941
- NO.
- WHAT ABOUT IF THEY SAY,

17:06.023 --> 17:08.444
"I'D LIKE TO MOVE IT
TO AN EASIER SPOT"?

17:08.527 --> 17:10.112
- NO, I'M PRETTY SURE.
- HE'S BEING VERY DELIBERATE.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.363
- WHAT IF THEY TELL YOU
IT'S GONNA HURT?

17:11.446 --> 17:12.698
- I KNOW IT'S GONNA HURT.

17:12.781 --> 17:13.824
{\an8}- CLEARLY, I MADE A BIG
IMPRESSION ON THE OTHER ARTISTS

17:13.906 --> 17:15.284
{\an8}BY CONTINUOUSLY MOVING
THE PLACEMENT.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.119
- WHERE DO YOU WANT IT?
- ON THE SIDE--RIB, RIGHT HERE.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.329
- YOU GONNA LET
ANYONE TALK YOU OUT OF IT?

17:19.413 --> 17:20.539
- NO.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.165
- EVERYONE HERE SHOULD GET
WHAT THEY WANT.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.541
- MM-HMM.
- YOU'RE THE CANVASES.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.792
YOU SHOULD TELL THESE ARTISTS,

17:24.877 --> 17:26.712
"NO ONE'S GONNA STOP ME
FROM GETTING WHAT I WANT."

17:26.795 --> 17:29.131
- THE DUDE JUST DID A TOTAL 180.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.049
{\an8}INSTEAD OF BEING,
"OH, NAMASTE.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.468
{\an8}MY NAME'S MARK.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.427
{\an8}EVERYTHING'S COOL,"

17:33.510 --> 17:34.136
{\an8}A LITTLE BIG OF PIGS' BLOOD,

17:34.219 --> 17:36.263
{\an8}AND IT ALL WENT TO HIS BRAIN.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.807
- I WANT THE CROSS
GOING STRAIGHT DOWN THE BACK,

17:38.891 --> 17:40.517
OMINOUS CLOUDS AROUND IT,

17:40.601 --> 17:42.853
AND TRIBAL THAT SAYS,
"TETELESTI"

17:42.936 --> 17:43.979
- WHAT?

17:44.062 --> 17:46.023
- AND A TORN CURTAIN,
REPRESENTING THE TORN VEIL.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.983
- WHY DON'T WE THROW
IN THE KITCHEN SINK TOO?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.027
- THIS GUY WANTS FROGS,
TOADS, HELICOPTERS.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.363
JUST GET THE JESUS
AND CALL IT A DAY.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.157
{\an8}ISN'T JESUS CHRIST ENOUGH?

17:55.240 --> 17:56.325
- AND WHAT'S THE LONGEST
YOU'VE SAT FOR A TATTOO?

17:56.408 --> 17:59.328
- I AIN'T GOT NONE.
- ALL RIGHT, WE GOT A VIRGIN.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.331
- WHAT?
- HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.416
{\an8}- MARK COULD THROW ME
THE HARDEST CANVAS OF THE DAY,

18:04.500 --> 18:07.294
{\an8}AND MY TATTOO'S STILL
GONNA BE BETTER THAN HIS.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.921
{\an8}- NO.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.964
- I'M GONNA ROCK
WHATEVER TATTOO IS THROWN AT ME.

18:11.048 --> 18:11.840
- GO BIG OR GO HOME.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.177
- ALL RIGHT, CANVASES,
ONE BY ONE,

18:15.260 --> 18:18.889
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.349
- CRIS.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.517
- DON.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.817
- JOSH.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.027
{\an8}- BIG SURPRISE,
I GOT THE RIBCAGE AGAIN.

18:32.110 --> 18:32.778
THIS IS MY CHANCE,
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

18:32.861 --> 18:35.072
TO SHUT UP ALL THE HATERS,

18:35.155 --> 18:37.157
PROVE THAT I CAN DO
A RIB TATTOO,

18:37.241 --> 18:40.160
AND I'M GONNA NAIL IT.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.620
- AARON.

18:41.703 --> 18:42.329
- EMILY.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.878
- HERE WE GO.

18:49.962 --> 18:50.963
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.130
- OH.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.131
- THAT'S IT.
YES.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.550
{\an8}- I GOT THE TATTOO VIRGIN.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.134
{\an8}BRING IT ON.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.637
- JASON.
- OH, NICE.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.638
- ERIC.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.682
- MARK.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.392
- REMEMBER,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:03.475 --> 19:07.062
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE ONE TATTOO

19:07.145 --> 19:08.981
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST,

19:09.064 --> 19:11.567
AND PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.651
YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS

19:12.734 --> 19:16.905
TO TATTOO CHRIST ON A CROSS
IN BLACK AND GRAY.

19:16.989 --> 19:21.159
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.244
- OH, BOY.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.328
- GOOD LUCK.

19:23.412 --> 19:23.996
[overlapping chatter]
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

19:24.079 --> 19:26.540
- READY TO GET IT ON, DOG?

19:26.623 --> 19:27.916
- THESE ARTISTS CAN GO TWO WAYS.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.377
{\an8}THEY CAN EITHER BE INTIMIDATED
BY TATTOOING NEXT TO TOMMY,

19:30.460 --> 19:32.421
{\an8}OR THEY CAN REALLY RISE
TO THE OCCASION.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.340
- I WANT A CROSS, BUT I WANT
THE JESUS WITHIN THE CROSS.

19:35.424 --> 19:35.716
- WITHIN THE CROSS.
- YES.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.718
- GOTCHA.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.177
- THIS IS THE TIME TO PROVE
THAT YOU ARE AN INK MASTER.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.805
- I WANT TO SEE THE GRAIN
OF THE WOOD.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.724
- OKAY, DEFINITELY, YEAH.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.517
- I WAS INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE
SURROUNDING THE CRUCIFIXION.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.561
- UH-HUH.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.729
SO YOU WANT THE WHOLE
KIND OF SCENE, THEN?

19:48.812 --> 19:50.105
{\an8}- YEAH.

19:50.188 --> 19:51.148
{\an8}- KENNY WANTS A REALLY ELABORATE
PIECE ON HIS BACK.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.358
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA HAVE TIME

19:53.442 --> 19:55.027
TO DO ALL OF WHAT KENNY WANTS.

19:55.110 --> 19:58.030
WE COULD DO SOMETHING THAT SHOWS
THE CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS,

19:58.113 --> 19:59.114
BUT MORE DRAMATIC.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.450
THE WHOLE CROSS
ON THE BACK IS A COOL IDEA,

20:01.533 --> 20:04.620
BUT YOU CAN GET THAT SAME
FEELING DOING A DIFFERENT IMAGE.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.204
I'M JUST GONNA
CHANGE HIS MIND A LITTLE.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.623
WE GOT TO AGREE
ON SOMETHING COOL

20:07.706 --> 20:08.290
AND HAMMER IT OUT.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.585
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.
DONE.

20:11.668 --> 20:12.544
- BACK OF THE CALF?
- YES.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.588
- OKAY.
- THE WHOLE JESUS CHRIST

20:14.671 --> 20:15.380
WITH THE THORNS
GOING ACROSS HIS HEAD,

20:15.464 --> 20:16.632
SOME DROPS OF BLOOD--
- OKAY.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.968
- ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE NAILS
ON HIS HANDS AND HIS FEET.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.262
I WOULD LIKE THE CROSS TO BE
REALISTIC WOOD...

20:22.346 --> 20:23.180
- OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.181
- AND THE LITTLE CUT
THAT HE HAD.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.307
- SURE, FROM THE SPEAR.
- MM-HMM.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.808
- YEAH, I GOT YOU, BUDDY.
OKAY, COOL.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.729
{\an8}THE IMAGE THAT MY CANVAS
WANTS IS CRAZY DIFFICULT,

20:30.812 --> 20:34.024
{\an8}BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH
FINE DETAIL IN THIS PIECE.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.069
- IF ANYTHING,
I WANT HIS FACE TO BE PERFECT.

20:37.152 --> 20:37.861
- RIGHT ON.
- AS PERFECT AS CAN BE.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.489
CAN YOU DO THAT?
- YEAH.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.241
I HAVE TO PRODUCE
A BAD ASS JESUS TATTOO.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.953
- WE ONLY HAVE SIX HOURS
TO DO THIS.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.579
WHAT WERE THE OTHER THINGS
YOU MENTIONED?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.539
- CURTAINS ON THE OUTSKIRT,

20:49.623 --> 20:52.292
TRIBAL OUTLINE
OF THE WORD, "TETELESTI."

20:52.376 --> 20:54.378
I WANTED THAT ON MY SHOULDERS,

20:54.461 --> 20:56.171
ABOVE THE OMINOUS CLOUDS.

20:56.254 --> 20:57.965
- JUST THIS TATTOO
ALONE IS GONNA TAKE SIX HOURS.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.425
{\an8}THIS GUY
DOESN'T HAVE ANY TATTOOS,

21:00.509 --> 21:02.177
{\an8}AND HE WANTS THE WHOLE
KITCHEN SINK IN ONE TATTOO.

21:02.260 --> 21:05.681
I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANY KIND
OF CHALLENGE AT ALL,

21:05.764 --> 21:09.267
BUT YOU WANT A 40-HOUR SOME
TATTOO IN 6.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.103
19 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
UNDER MY BELT

21:11.186 --> 21:13.188
LEADS UP TO
THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW.

21:13.271 --> 21:13.855
- IT'S A BLACK AND WHITE JESUS
ON THE CROSS.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.024
- FOR SURE, FOR SURE,

21:16.108 --> 21:17.442
BUT I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT
MY OWN FOOT.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.319
IF I DON'T PUT MY MONEY
WHERE MY MOUTH IS,

21:19.403 --> 21:22.072
I COULD BE
OUT OF THIS COMPETITION.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.375
- THE OTHER THING THAT I
WAS THINKING ABOUT WANTING

21:33.458 --> 21:35.544
WAS TRIBAL ON THE TOP
OF MY SHOULDERS.

21:35.627 --> 21:40.215
ON THE BOTTOM, I WAS ALREADY
THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE.

21:40.298 --> 21:42.092
- I PICKED THE TATTOO VIRGIN
JUST FOR CLEEN.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.635
THIS GUY KNOWS NOTHING
ABOUT TATTOOS

21:43.719 --> 21:45.554
AND WANTS 10,000 THINGS
IN THIS DESIGN.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.888
CLEEN TRIES TO GET INTO MY HEAD.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.849
NOW, IT'S MY TURN
TO GET INTO HIS HEAD.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.767
- I'M ALL FOR GIVING YOU
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT,

21:50.851 --> 21:56.356
BUT WHAT YOU WANT
ISN'T POSSIBLE.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.774
- I [bleep] KNEW IT.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.651
YOU GUYS ARE BFFs NOW,
AREN'T YOU?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.111
- DID YOU KNOW
THAT HE WANTS A TRIBAL

22:01.194 --> 22:02.738
GOING FROM SHOULDER BLADE
TO SHOULDER BLADE?

22:02.821 --> 22:04.197
- SOUNDS AWESOME.

22:04.281 --> 22:07.534
- DO YOU FEEL THAT I COULD DO
A JESUS ON A CROSS

22:07.617 --> 22:08.577
AND A HUGE TRIBAL GOING ACROSS

22:08.660 --> 22:12.164
HIS WHOLE, ENTIRE
SHOULDER BLADES IN SIX HOURS?

22:12.247 --> 22:14.374
- IN THIS COMPETITION, THERE'S
NOTHING THAT YOU CAN'T DO.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.293
- THAT'S TRUE.
- YOU'RE UNSTOPPABLE.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.336
- THAT'S TRUE.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.712
- YOU'RE AN
INCREDIBLE FORCE HERE.

22:18.795 --> 22:19.880
- TRUE.

22:19.963 --> 22:20.797
- NOBODY CAN TOUCH YOU, RIGHT?
- TRUE.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.799
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE?

22:22.883 --> 22:24.301
- WELL, 'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA
SHOOT MY FOOT

22:24.384 --> 22:26.553
AND START A TATTOO
THAT I CAN'T FINISH.

22:32.559 --> 22:35.395
- ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE A TATTOO

22:35.479 --> 22:38.231
THAT CAN HOLD ITS OWN
AGAINST TOMMY MONTOYA'S,

22:38.315 --> 22:41.777
AND YOUR TIME
STARTS NOW.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.028
- READY TO DO THIS?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.197
- GRAB A SEAT.
- OKAY.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.114
- FIRST TATTOO.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.867
- YES, SIR.
- I GOT YOU, MAN.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.994
- HAVING TOMMY TATTOO HEAD
TO HEAD WITH THESE ARTISTS

22:51.078 --> 22:52.496
IS REALLY GONNA
PUT THE PRESSURE ON THEM.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.164
{\an8}THESE ARTISTS ARE GONNA HAVE
TO PUT OUT

22:54.247 --> 22:55.165
{\an8}A REALLY HIGH QUALITY TATTOO

22:55.248 --> 22:58.794
{\an8}TO EVEN STAND
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO TOMMY.

22:58.877 --> 22:59.961
- HEY, JASON--
- YEAH?

23:00.045 --> 23:01.379
- YOU THINK I SHOULD MOVE
THIS TO HIS LEG?

23:01.463 --> 23:03.465
- I MEAN, THAT IS YOUR M.O.,
DUDE, TO GET OFF THE RIBS.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.050
- I THINK I GOT A BUNCH
OF [bleep] TALKERS

23:05.133 --> 23:06.051
TO PROVE SOMETHING TO,

23:06.134 --> 23:07.803
SO MIGHT AS WELL
JUST DO WHAT THE GUY WANTS.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.805
- SOMEONE UNPLUGGED MY [bleep].

23:09.888 --> 23:11.932
SOMEONE ALREADY SABOTAGED ME.

23:12.015 --> 23:15.685
{\an8}ANYONE THAT KNOWS ME KNOWS I
HAVE A BLACK BELT IN TATTOOING.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.104
I'M GONNA KILL THIS PIECE.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.108
IF THEY WANT TO BEAT ME,

23:21.191 --> 23:22.526
THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO THE BEST PIECE

23:22.609 --> 23:23.902
THEY'VE EVER DONE
IN THEIR WHOLE LIFE.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.613
I'M MASTER BLASTER.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.496
- I'M FEELING VERY VERSATILE.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.706
I CAN ADAPT TO ANY STYLE.

23:36.790 --> 23:37.999
{\an8}MARK TRIED TO KNOCK ME DOWN
WITH THIS TATTOO.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.084
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.962
THIS IS WHERE EXPERIENCE SPEAKS.

23:42.045 --> 23:42.671
I MIGHT NOT KNOW HOW TO DO MUCH,

23:42.754 --> 23:44.423
BUT I DO KNOW HOW TO TATTOO.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.841
THERE AIN'T NO STOPPING ME.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.509
- FOUR MORE HOURS TO GO,
EVERYBODY.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.019
- MARKY THE TRICKSTER OVER HERE.

23:58.103 --> 23:58.937
- WHY AM I THE TRICKSTER?

23:59.020 --> 24:00.814
- INTERESTING TO HEAR
ALL THE THINGS

24:00.897 --> 24:02.691
THAT YOU HAD TO SAY
TO THOSE FINE PEOPLE.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.693
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET
ANY OF MY CANVASES

24:04.776 --> 24:06.862
TO EVER MOVE WHERE THEY
WERE GONNA GET THEIR TATTOO

24:06.945 --> 24:08.029
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.489
I WANTED EVERYBODY
TO FEEL MY PAIN.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.615
{\an8}I'M ON THE UPSWING,

24:10.699 --> 24:12.534
{\an8}AND NOTHING CAN STOP ME NOW.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.536
I'M DOING A GREAT JOB
OF SHOWING GRADATION.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.496
I'M TURNING THE TABLE
ON THE BIG DOGS TODAY,

24:16.580 --> 24:20.333
AND I'M GONNA DO
AN AMAZING TATTOO.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.961
- BIG [bleep] PIECE THERE, BRO.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.087
- TRYING TO SHUT SOME PEOPLE UP.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.463
{\an8}I AM SO TIRED OF EVERYBODY

24:25.547 --> 24:28.466
{\an8}TELLING ME
THAT I CAN'T DO A RIB TATTOO.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.718
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT I'M AFRAID OF.

24:29.801 --> 24:33.513
I AM DOING THE BIGGEST TATTOO
POSSIBLE ON THIS GUY'S SIDE.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.891
NORMALLY, I WOULD'VE
TOLD YOU ALL THIS STUFF

24:35.974 --> 24:38.226
AND TALKED YOU OUT OF IT,
BUT NOT TODAY.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.395
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO SHUT UP ALL THE HATERS.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.730
I'M REALLY GONNA PROVE A POINT.

24:41.813 --> 24:45.066
I CAN'T GIVE THEM ANY REASON,
WHATSOEVER,

24:45.150 --> 24:46.651
TO NOT GIVE ME THE TITLE.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.361
- TWO HOURS REMAIN.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.158
- BEAR WITH ME, GIRL.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.410
- I'M DEFINITELY GLAD WE WENT

24:55.493 --> 24:56.077
WITH THIS IDEA
AND NOT THE FULL CROSS.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.663
{\an8}- YEAH, I THINK THAT...

25:03.585 --> 25:05.879
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE I DON'T
BOAST OR BRAG

25:05.962 --> 25:07.547
{\an8}OR WEAR MY EMOTIONS
ON MY SLEEVE

25:07.631 --> 25:10.926
{\an8}DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M NOT HERE
TO WIN THIS COMPETITION.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.260
- CRIS, YOU DON'T ATTACK.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.428
THIS IS YOUR TIME, MAN.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.388
YOU'RE AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE.

25:15.472 --> 25:18.099
YOU DON'T ATTACK NOW,
YOU'RE GONNA BE GONE.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.436
- I WANT THIS MORE THAN ANYBODY.

25:21.519 --> 25:23.813
- AS SOON AS I SEE
WHAT CRIS IS DOING,

25:23.897 --> 25:24.773
I'M INSTANTLY CONFUSED.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.483
IT'S REALLY HARD
TO TELL WHAT'S GOING ON.

25:26.566 --> 25:30.445
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
CLEAR CUT, JESUS ON THE CROSS.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.697
IT'S MISSING THE MARK.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.908
- ONE HOUR REMAINING.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.917
- THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY ROUGH
COMPETITION FOR ME,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.127
AND I THINK
THIS IS FINALLY A BIG WIN,

25:46.211 --> 25:48.588
SO I'M PRETTY EXCITED.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.675
{\an8}ALL THIS FINE DETAIL
THAT I WAS FREAKING OUT ABOUT,

25:51.758 --> 25:52.842
{\an8}IT LOOKS GREAT.

25:52.926 --> 25:55.387
{\an8}IT'S SMOOTH.
THE GRADIENTS ARE IN THERE.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.389
I'VE GOT THIS DOWN PAT.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.807
THIS IS MINE.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.934
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
BE VERY HAPPY.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.311
- EMILY'S TATTOO
IS [bleep] UGLY.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.647
IT'S NOT EVEN STRAIGHT.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.149
{\an8}SO HELP ME, JESUS, PLEASE,

26:08.233 --> 26:10.902
{\an8}LET THIS TATTOO SEND HER HOME.

26:15.699 --> 26:19.494
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN,

26:19.577 --> 26:21.496
SIX, FIVE,

26:21.579 --> 26:22.539
FOUR,

26:22.622 --> 26:24.666
THREE, TWO,

26:24.749 --> 26:25.625
ONE.

26:25.709 --> 26:26.543
THAT IS IT.

26:26.626 --> 26:28.128
TIME'S UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

26:28.211 --> 26:30.130
NO MORE TATTOOING.

26:30.213 --> 26:33.008
- ALL RIGHT, DUDE.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.384
- LIKE IT?
- HELL, YEAH.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.011
- I DIG IT, MAN.
I'M JUST HAPPY I GOT IT DONE.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.013
IT'S A HUGE TATTOO.
- VERY COOL.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.347
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.348
- YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.683
- TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.393
- FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THIS COMPETITION,

26:43.476 --> 26:45.020
CLEEN NEEDS TO BE WORRIED
ABOUT GOING HOME.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.689
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF A JESUS TATTOO IS THE FACE,

26:47.772 --> 26:50.025
AND CLEEN ROYALLY
MESSED THIS THING UP.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.943
I MADE HIM TAKE OFF
HIS SUPER CLEEN CAPE

26:52.027 --> 26:52.652
AND PROVE THAT HE HAS FLAWS.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.324
{\an8}- I'M HERE TO [bleep] COMPETE.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.867
{\an8}- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START?

26:58.950 --> 27:00.118
- I BELONG HERE.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.536
- EITHER SHOW US
THAT YOU CAN DO BETTER

27:01.619 --> 27:02.871
OR LET THE BIG GUYS PLAY.

27:02.954 --> 27:03.705
- I KNOW I CAN DO BETTER
THAN THIS.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.540
- I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.
- YOU'RE DONE!

27:05.623 --> 27:09.127
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA TATTOO,
EVER AGAIN.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.384
- THIS WHOLE RUNNING
AROUND THE HOUSE,

27:16.468 --> 27:18.386
BEING A [bleep] COCKY ASS[bleep]
WITH THE PERFECT TATTOOS

27:18.470 --> 27:20.472
IS ONLY GONNA GET YOU SO FAR.

27:20.555 --> 27:21.806
- OH, STOP IT.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.892
- PEOPLE WANT TO GET TATTOOED
BY PEOPLE THEY CAN RELATE TO.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.101
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A FEW ISSUES
WITH MY TATTOOS,

27:25.185 --> 27:27.479
PROVES THAT I'M HUMAN.

27:27.562 --> 27:28.897
PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE LIKE,
"THAT DUDE'S [bleep] COOL.

27:28.980 --> 27:29.898
I'M DOWN WITH THAT DUDE."

27:29.981 --> 27:31.816
- EVEN MY BAD DECISIONS

27:31.900 --> 27:33.777
STILL ARE BETTER THAN
YOUR BEST DECISION.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.446
- IF YOU'RE GONNA LEARN ANYTHING
FROM THE REST OF US

27:36.529 --> 27:37.906
SITTING AROUND HERE,
YOU SHOULD LEARN THAT--

27:37.989 --> 27:39.407
- YOU--IF WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT [bleep],

27:39.491 --> 27:42.202
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA TATTOO,
EVER AGAIN.

27:42.285 --> 27:43.912
YOU'RE DONE!

27:43.995 --> 27:44.287
YOU HAVEN'T SHOWN
[bleep].

27:44.371 --> 27:46.206
NOTHING!

27:46.289 --> 27:47.582
- I'M GONNA
TELL YOU THIS RIGHT HERE.

27:47.665 --> 27:48.792
IF I MAKE IT DOWNSTAIRS,

27:48.875 --> 27:51.127
AND I COME BACK UP
THROUGH THAT GODDAMN DOOR,

27:51.211 --> 27:52.462
YOU WATCH YOUR [bleep] ASS.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.506
- YOU'RE SO GOOD AT [bleep] UP
AND DOWN THOSE [bleep] STAIRS--

27:54.589 --> 27:57.008
- YOU DON'T RESPECT ANYBODY
HERE, SO...

27:57.092 --> 27:58.843
- OH, STOP IT.
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

27:58.927 --> 28:00.637
TAKE YOU OUT.
- PSSH.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.943
- TODAY, YOU HAD TO
SHOW SMOOTH GRADATION

28:15.026 --> 28:17.570
BY TATTOOING HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH OUR GUEST JUDGE,

28:17.654 --> 28:20.281
BLACK AND GRAY EXPERT
TOMMY MONTOYA.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.618
- I THINK THIS IS
THE BEST TURNOUT

28:23.701 --> 28:24.661
WE'VE EVER HAD
ON BLACK AND GRAY DAY.

28:24.744 --> 28:27.956
- TOMMY MOTIVATED YOU GUYS,
TO SAY THE LEAST,

28:28.039 --> 28:31.084
BECAUSE ALL IN ALL, YOU GUYS
DID SOME REALLY NICE TATTOOS.

28:31.167 --> 28:34.587
- BEFORE WE BEGIN, LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT TOMMY'S TATTOO.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.214
- IF YOU LOOK IN THE PITS
OF THE EYE AND THE BRIDGE

28:36.297 --> 28:38.216
OF THE NOSE--SOLID BLACK,

28:38.299 --> 28:39.426
AND THEN THE EYELID
JUST SOFTENS

28:39.509 --> 28:41.845
ALL THE WAY OVER TO OPEN SKIN.

28:41.928 --> 28:46.224
THESE AREAS REALLY SHOW SMOOTH
GRADATION FROM DARK TO LIGHT.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.350
- ANYBODY HAVE ANY COMMENTS?

28:47.434 --> 28:50.019
- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF BLACK
IN THE ACTUAL CROSS.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.354
IT DEFINITELY LOOKS
LIKE A COVER-UP.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.397
- I COULD'VE DONE THE WOOD

28:52.480 --> 28:55.316
A LITTLE MORE GRAINY
AND A LITTLE MORE LIGHT,

28:55.400 --> 28:59.070
BUT THE REASON THAT FACE POPS
SO MUCH IS 'CAUSE THAT BLACK

28:59.154 --> 28:59.737
IS RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.573
- BUT THE FACE IS SO DARK,

29:01.656 --> 29:03.616
IT LOOKS LIKE IT KIND
OF ALMOST BLENDS INTO IT.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.534
SAME WITH THE HAIR.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.202
- TOMMY IS TOMMY
FOR THE SIMPLE FACT

29:06.286 --> 29:07.370
THAT YOU CAN'T SEE
WHERE IT STARTS AND ENDS.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.497
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT SHADING,

29:09.581 --> 29:12.500
THAT IS THE ESSENCE
OF GRADATION.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.793
IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND SMOOTH,

29:13.877 --> 29:14.961
AND IT'S FEATHERED ON.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.463
THAT'S WHAT WE ALL ASPIRE FOR.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.090
- LET'S GET INTO YOUR TATTOOS.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.301
MARK, LET'S START WITH YOU.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.013
- I LIKE IT OVERALL,
BUT THE ONLY SPOTS

29:25.096 --> 29:28.808
WHERE I REALLY SEE A SMOOTH
GRADATION IN THIS TATTOO

29:28.892 --> 29:32.353
WAS IN THE OUTER RAYS, AND THEN,
IN HIS FACE, AROUND HIS EYES.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.939
THERE'S A LOT OF TONES,
BUT THERE'S NOT THAT GRADATION

29:35.023 --> 29:37.317
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.860
{\an8}- IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHADING

29:38.943 --> 29:41.696
{\an8}THAT TOMMY HAS UNDER
THE RIGHT EYE AND THE CHEEK,

29:41.779 --> 29:42.864
{\an8}AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOURS,

29:42.947 --> 29:45.450
{\an8}YOUR SIDE JUST LOOKS
FLATTER AND WEAKER.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.622
- AARON.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.333
- I'M SUPER IMPRESSED
WITH THE FACE.

29:53.416 --> 29:55.210
YOU GOT REALLY, REALLY STRONG,

29:55.293 --> 29:57.212
HIGH DETAIL
WITHOUT MUDDYING IT UP.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.005
- YEAH, IT WAS DEFINITELY TOUGH
TRYING TO GET ALL THAT

29:59.088 --> 30:00.924
LITTLE, TEENY STUFF IN THERE
SO IT WAS STILL READABLE.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.425
- YOU KILLED IT FOR THAT SIZE.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.635
IT'S PROBABLY THE SIZE
OF A THUMB,

30:03.718 --> 30:04.969
AND YOU CAN TELL IT'S JESUS.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.554
YOU HAVE THORNS IN THERE.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.932
THE BEARD,
THE HAIR--THAT'S HARD TO DO.

30:09.015 --> 30:10.683
{\an8}- COMPARING TO TOMMY'S TATTOO,

30:10.767 --> 30:13.478
{\an8}IT'S NOT AS SATURATED
OR AS SMOOTH,

30:13.561 --> 30:16.898
{\an8}BUT IT DID ACCOMPLISH THE EFFECT
OF HITTING THE CHALLENGE TODAY.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.316
OVERALL, GREAT TATTOO.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.567
- THANKS, GUYS.

30:21.277 --> 30:25.406
- ERIC.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.574
- THERE'S A LOT
OF STRONG POINTS IN THIS TATTOO.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.536
THE REALLY LIGHT GRAYS
IN THE CROSS

30:29.619 --> 30:31.996
AND THE DARK SHADOWS
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE CROSS,

30:32.080 --> 30:32.413
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR,

30:32.497 --> 30:34.624
DARK TO LIGHT.

30:34.707 --> 30:38.086
EXCELLENT EXAMPLES OF GRADATION
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TATTOO.

30:38.169 --> 30:42.340
- JASON.

30:42.423 --> 30:45.802
- YOU PICKED A HARD REFERENCE,
A LOT OF FORCED PERSPECTIVE.

30:45.885 --> 30:47.554
THE CROSS, WHERE YOU GO
FROM BLACK

30:47.637 --> 30:49.264
ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE END,

30:49.347 --> 30:51.015
IT'S A REALLY
NICE EXAMPLE OF GRADATION.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.183
- THE FACE,
YOU DID GO KIND OF DARK,

30:52.267 --> 30:55.520
BUT THAT, OF COURSE, IS GONNA
LIGHTEN UP IN TEN YEARS.

30:55.603 --> 30:56.771
THAT'S LIKE WINE OR CHEESE.

30:56.854 --> 30:58.815
IT'S GONNA GET BETTER WITH AGE.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.525
{\an8}- LOOKING AT THE SHADING
THAT TOMMY DOES ON HIS TATTOO,

31:00.608 --> 31:03.069
{\an8}IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS BORN THERE.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.612
{\an8}IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE IT WAS PUT THERE.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.781
{\an8}IT'S A GIFT,
AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE IT,

31:06.864 --> 31:08.199
{\an8}AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.244
- DON.

31:14.872 --> 31:16.708
YOUR CANVAS WANTED
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.752
- YEAH, SHE WANTED A NEGATIVE
CROSS WITH CHRIST INSIDE OF IT.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.588
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
I WAS PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT IT.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.756
- THIS IS KIND OF A WEIRD,
TRICKY TATTOO TO PULL OFF,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.967
AND I THINK THIS IS
THE WAY TO DO IT.

31:26.050 --> 31:26.676
THE BLACK IS SOLID.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.803
THE GRADIENTS ARE VERY SOFT.

31:28.886 --> 31:30.305
THERE'S JUST ENOUGH DETAIL
IN THE FACE

31:30.388 --> 31:33.099
AND IN THE CROWN OF THORNS TO
LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS JESUS.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.855
- JOSH.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.815
- YOU HIT GRADATION
OUT OF THE PARK.

31:40.898 --> 31:44.360
THE FRONT LEG
ON THIS TATTOO IS BEAUTIFUL.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.195
TO ME, THAT'S YOUR HIGHLIGHT
OF THE WHOLE TATTOO.

31:46.279 --> 31:50.158
{\an8}- TO BE HONEST, IT DOESN'T
LOOK THAT FAR FROM MY SHADING.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.952
{\an8}MY ONLY COMPLAINT
IS THAT IT'S NOT ON MY RIBS.

31:55.830 --> 31:58.666
- EMILY.

31:58.750 --> 31:59.709
- THE LEGS,

31:59.792 --> 32:01.669
WHEN YOU COMPARE THEM
TO THE REST OF THE BODY,

32:01.753 --> 32:04.464
THEY DEFINITELY HAVE SOME KIND
OF FORESHORTENING GOING ON.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.799
FROM HIS SHOULDER
TO HIS PELVIC BONE

32:06.883 --> 32:10.303
IS WAY LONGER THAN FROM
THE WAIST DOWN TO HIS ANKLES.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.180
- THE CROSS
IS BENDING EVERYWHERE.

32:12.263 --> 32:12.889
SKIN IS NOT PAPER,

32:12.972 --> 32:15.516
AND SKIN IS NOT FLAT LIKE PAPER,

32:15.600 --> 32:17.268
AND THAT HAS TO BE
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT

32:17.352 --> 32:18.895
WHEN YOU'RE DOING THESE KINDS
OF DESIGNS.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.690
- CRIS.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.984
IT'S HARD TO TELL
THAT THIS IS JESUS.

32:25.068 --> 32:28.029
WITH THE ABS, ESPECIALLY,
IT EITHER LOOKS LIKE ARMOR,

32:28.112 --> 32:30.740
OR IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
AN AUTOPSY HAPPENING.

32:30.823 --> 32:32.950
- HE SAID HE WANTED
A RIPPED UP JESUS,

32:33.034 --> 32:34.702
SO I JUST DID WHAT HE SAID.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.871
- I JUST THINK YOU
PICKED A BAD DESIGN, DUDE.

32:36.954 --> 32:37.538
AND I KNOW
YOUR CLIENT WANTED IT,

32:37.622 --> 32:40.041
BUT THIS IS A COMPETITION.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.377
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM, "HEY,
IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT."

32:42.460 --> 32:43.294
YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN SHADE.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.797
{\an8}- AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS
IN YOUR TATTOO

32:45.880 --> 32:47.965
{\an8}THAT ARE VERY SMOOTH
AND HAVE A NICE GRADIENT,

32:48.049 --> 32:50.718
{\an8}BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS, ONCE YOU
LOOK OVER TO TOMMY'S TATTOO,

32:50.802 --> 32:52.178
{\an8}ALL THE TATTOO LOOKS
SMOOTH AND SOFT.

32:55.556 --> 32:56.641
- CLEEN.

32:58.976 --> 33:00.687
THE FACE, MAN,
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

33:00.770 --> 33:01.896
- IT'S JESUS
ON THE CROSS IN PAIN.

33:01.979 --> 33:05.066
- YOU KEPT IT REAL WITH ME,
SO I OWE YOU THE SAME RESPECT.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.360
THE FACE,
IT SUCKS, BRO.

33:07.443 --> 33:10.446
RIGHT NOW, JESUS
IS LOOKING LIKE A MUPPET, MAN.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.781
BUT YOU'RE LUCKY,

33:11.864 --> 33:15.201
BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE
IS [bleep] BAD ASS.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.412
THE GRADATION
IN ALL THE BODY IS SOFT,

33:17.495 --> 33:18.746
YOU KNOW, AND NICE.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.082
I LIKE HOW YOU DID SOME OUTLINE
ON THE ARMS AND THE WRISTS

33:21.165 --> 33:22.542
SO THAT IT SEPARATES IT
FROM THE CROSS.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.877
IT'S A GOOD TAT, MAN.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.963
{\an8}- JUST LOOKING AT THE RICHNESS
OF THE TWO BLACKS,

33:27.046 --> 33:28.715
{\an8}COMPARING THEM SIDE-BY-SIDE,

33:28.798 --> 33:31.008
{\an8}TOMMY'S BLACK
IS REALLY, REALLY BLACK,

33:31.092 --> 33:32.135
{\an8}AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOURS,

33:32.218 --> 33:34.554
{\an8}IT DOESN'T SHOW AS PACKED
AND SOLID,

33:34.637 --> 33:36.556
{\an8}AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.936
- TIME TO POLL THE JUDGES.

33:42.019 --> 33:44.355
WHO HAD THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY?

33:44.439 --> 33:45.732
- I REALLY LIKE ERIC'S.

33:45.815 --> 33:46.899
JUST THE WAY THE EYES LOOK,
AND THE BRIDGE OF THE NOSE,

33:46.983 --> 33:49.736
AND HOW YOU CAPTURED
THAT WAS REALLY NICE.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.696
BUT THE ONE
THAT STANDS OUT TO ME

33:51.779 --> 33:55.116
AS A REALLY CONSISTENT DISPLAY
OF SMOOTH GRADIENTS IS JOSH.

33:55.199 --> 33:55.658
- I LIKE JOSH.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.492
IT JUST WAS CLEAN.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.828
IT WAS CONSISTENT.

33:58.911 --> 34:01.247
- JOSH AND I HAVE BEEN RIVALS
SINCE LAST TIME HE WAS HERE,

34:01.330 --> 34:04.959
AND I ALWAYS TELL HIM THAT
HIS DESIGNS ARE STIFF AND RIGID,

34:05.042 --> 34:07.086
AND TODAY, YOU FOUND YOUR FLOW.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.130
- FINAL DECISION.
- JOSH.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.172
- JOSH.

34:10.255 --> 34:11.090
- JOSH.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.092
- JOSH.
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.177
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

34:14.260 --> 34:17.179
- THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

34:17.263 --> 34:20.975
AND THEIR VOTE WILL PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

34:21.058 --> 34:22.143
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.395
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.819
- OH, GOD,
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.571
GOD, I DON'T WANT TO GO.

34:33.654 --> 34:34.572
- I THINK IT'S
PRETTY SAFE TO SAY

34:34.655 --> 34:36.324
YOU'RE PROBABLY AT LEAST
GOING DOWNSTAIRS.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.992
- WELL, I KNOW THAT.
- WE ARE RIVALS,

34:38.076 --> 34:40.244
AND I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE
THAN TO SEND YOUR ASS HOME.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.161
- I'M NOT READY.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.705
I'M SO FAR IN THIS COMPETITION,

34:42.789 --> 34:45.875
AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NOT EVEN
STARTED MY ENGINE YET.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.503
- EVERY TIME
YOU'VE GONE DOWNSTAIRS,

34:48.585 --> 34:49.212
YOU'RE LIKE,
"I HAVEN'T STARTED YET."

34:49.295 --> 34:50.170
IF YOU GIVE THE SAME SPEECH

34:50.254 --> 34:52.672
ALL OVER AGAIN
AND THEN NOT CHANGE SOMETHING,

34:52.757 --> 34:54.175
THEN YOU JUST
LOOK LIKE AN ASS[bleep].

34:54.257 --> 34:55.342
- I'M NOT DONE FIGHTING.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.719
- LIKE, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
STEP UP THE GAME

34:56.803 --> 34:57.929
AND GIVE ME SOMETHING
TO CHALLENGE YOU ON--

34:58.012 --> 34:59.722
- DUDE,
I'M HERE TO [bleep] COMPETE.

34:59.806 --> 35:00.681
- WELL,
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START?

35:00.765 --> 35:03.017
- I DON'T [bleep] KNOW, AARON.

35:03.100 --> 35:03.518
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.728
- JUST ASKING.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.980
- I'M JUST GONNA GO
PREPARE MYSELF TO GO DOWNSTAIRS,

35:08.064 --> 35:12.318
SO Y'ALL [bleep] ENJOY
TALKING [bleep].

35:16.114 --> 35:17.949
- IF YOU HAVEN'T STARTED
YOUR ENGINE YET,

35:18.032 --> 35:19.033
WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

35:19.116 --> 35:20.952
- THAT [bleep] SHOULD BE
WARMED UP,

35:21.035 --> 35:22.203
TUNED UP, READY TO GO.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.455
- YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
PICK IT UP AND BLOW US ALL AWAY?

35:24.539 --> 35:25.665
- I DON'T SEE ANYTHING HAPPENING

35:25.748 --> 35:28.668
BUT THAT DEFEATED PERSON
DEFEATING HERSELF.

35:35.925 --> 35:38.719
- TODAY, WE'RE TESTING GRADATION
WITH BLACK AND GRAY TATTOOS.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.012
WHO ARE YOUR BOTTOMS OF THE DAY?

35:40.096 --> 35:40.805
- MY BOTTOMS ARE VERY CLEAR.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.307
EMILY, BECAUSE HER TATTOO

35:43.391 --> 35:45.560
HAS GOT A LOT
OF REALLY POOR EFFECTS TO IT.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.770
THE SHADING ON THE CROSS
IS PRETTY BEAT.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.689
THE FACE IS BAD.
THE HAIR IS BAD.

35:49.772 --> 35:53.150
- I JUST THINK THIS TATTOO
WASN'T AESTHETICALLY RIGHT.

35:53.234 --> 35:56.153
- I GOT MARK, JUST BECAUSE
THERE IS NO GRADIENTS,

35:56.237 --> 35:59.240
NO REPRESENTATION
OF A REAL BLACK AND GRAY TATTOO.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.409
- HE HAS SO MUCH LINE WORK
GOING ON IN THERE,

36:01.492 --> 36:03.494
THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR ANY GRADATION.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.706
- AND THEN CRIS',
MOSTLY, DESIGN CHOICES.

36:06.789 --> 36:07.665
- THE WHOLE TORSO
IS JUST HAMMERED.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.750
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN OPENED.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.419
- YEAH, I MEAN,
IT LOOKS LIKE AN AUTOPSY.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.629
- YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S CRAZY.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.716
- I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE
HUMAN CANVAS JURY COMES UP WITH.

36:16.799 --> 36:17.592
I THINK WE'RE ALL AGREED,
THOUGH.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.427
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.

36:19.510 --> 36:23.848
{\an7}- WE ARE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAD THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.057
THAT'S MY TATTOO.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.268
MY ARTIST WAS DON.
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.271
JESUS CHRIST'S FACE, YOU REALLY
CAN'T TELL THAT IT'S HIM.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.188
I FEEL LIKE IT'S TOO DARK.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.024
- I WAS GONNA SAY
THE SAME THING.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.026
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS VERY
GOOD SHADOWING AND CONTRAST.

36:35.109 --> 36:37.945
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS KIND
OF HEAVY-HANDED.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.573
- THAT IS MY TATTOO.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.491
MY ARTIST WAS EMILY.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.744
- WHAT I DON'T LIKE
ABOUT THE TATTOO ARE THE LEGS.

36:44.827 --> 36:45.786
- THE KNEES LOOK INVERTED.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.955
- I CAN'T GET
OVER THE PROPORTION OF THE LEGS

36:48.039 --> 36:50.416
TO THE REST OF THE BODY.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.626
- AND THE ARMS TO THE HANDS.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.627
THEY LOOK LIKE
LITTLE BABY HANDS.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.129
- YEAH.

36:55.212 --> 36:56.714
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.633
MY ARTIST WAS CLEEN ROCK ONE.

36:58.716 --> 37:01.052
- I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT HIS FACIAL EXPRESSION.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.386
HIS MOUTH LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST
WIDE OPEN, LIKE--

37:02.470 --> 37:04.847
- I THINK IT WOULD BE
A LOT BETTER IF IT DIDN'T HAVE

37:04.931 --> 37:06.265
ALL THAT BLACK IN THE BACK.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.266
- YEAH.
- I AGREE.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.643
- YEAH, IT'S TOO MUCH.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.144
- I THINK THIS ONE'S BETTER
THAN EMILY'S TATTOO.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.313
{\an8}- EMILY'S IS LESS DEFINED,

37:12.396 --> 37:15.066
{\an8}WHEREAS CLEEN'S
IS OVERLY DEFINED.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.443
{\an8}BETWEEN THE TWO OF THOSE,
WHOSE WAS THE WORST?

37:17.526 --> 37:20.446
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY CLEEN.

37:20.529 --> 37:20.821
DO WE ALL AGREE?

37:20.905 --> 37:23.032
all: YES.

37:27.745 --> 37:28.913
- HERE WE GO.

37:28.996 --> 37:32.667
- THE JUDGES WANT TO SEE...

37:32.750 --> 37:34.293
EMILY...

37:34.377 --> 37:35.878
CRIS...

37:35.962 --> 37:37.672
CLEEN...

37:37.755 --> 37:40.508
AND MARK.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.970
SEE YOU AND YOUR RIVALS
DOWNSTAIRS.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.179
- I DIDN'T EVEN SEE THAT COMING.

37:45.262 --> 37:47.390
- CLEEN GETS TO GO
TO THE BOTTOM.

37:47.473 --> 37:48.641
- PREPARE TO FEEL [bleep].

37:48.724 --> 37:49.976
- [bleep].

37:59.527 --> 38:01.445
- TODAY, YOU HAD
TO SHOW SMOOTH GRADATION

38:01.529 --> 38:05.533
BY TATTOOING CHRIST
ON A CROSS IN BLACK AND GRAY.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.369
CLEEN, MARK, EMILY, AND CRIS,

38:08.452 --> 38:12.415
ANY ONE OF YOU
COULD BE JUSTIFIABLY ELIMINATED.

38:15.584 --> 38:18.713
CLEEN, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:18.796 --> 38:21.841
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:21.924 --> 38:23.759
- IT SUCKS.

38:23.843 --> 38:24.927
I KNOW I BOMBED THE FACE
A LITTLE BIT,

38:25.011 --> 38:27.680
AND I TRIED TO MAKE MY CANVAS
AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.306
- I DO AGREE THAT, HONESTLY,

38:29.390 --> 38:31.183
YOU HAVE ONE OF
THE WORST FACES OF THE DAY.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.061
- THERE'S NO EXCUSES;
I'M EMBARRASSED.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.896
- MARK.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.940
- THE ROSE, THE LEAVES,
THE CROSS,

38:38.024 --> 38:39.483
ALL THAT IS JUST
REALLY DARK BLACK.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.361
THE FACT THAT IT IS A BLACK
AND GRAY GRADATION CHALLENGE--

38:42.445 --> 38:44.155
YOU REALLY MISSED THE MARK.

38:44.238 --> 38:45.489
- HONESTLY, I'M REALLY SURPRISED

38:45.573 --> 38:46.907
THAT I'M DOWN HERE
AT THE BOTTOM.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.409
I'M REALLY
AT THIS PINNACLE POINT.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.952
I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING
MY TURNAROUND.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.495
- IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA

38:51.579 --> 38:54.832
COME IN AND BLOW US AWAY
TO ACTUALLY BE IN THE FINALE.

38:57.209 --> 38:58.419
- CRIS.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.171
- IN YOUR DESIGN SELECTIONS,

39:00.254 --> 39:02.089
YOU'RE JUST NOT GIVING US
ANYTHING.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.550
FIGHT OR LET THE BIG GUYS PLAY.

39:04.633 --> 39:07.011
- I DON'T WANT THIS TO EMBODY
WHAT I CAN PRESENT TO YOU.

39:07.094 --> 39:09.430
I HAVE A LOT MORE TO PROVE,

39:09.513 --> 39:10.347
AND I KNOW
I CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.099
- EITHER SHOW US
THAT YOU CAN DO BETTER

39:12.183 --> 39:16.228
OR IT'S LIGHTS OUT, BUD.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.104
- EMILY.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.023
- YOUR TATTOO HAS
A LOT OF ISSUES.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.192
- YOU'RE A TATTOO ARTIST.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.276
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE
TO FIND A REFERENCE

39:22.359 --> 39:25.613
THAT SETS YOU UP
FOR SUCCESS, NOT FAILURE.

39:25.696 --> 39:29.742
- I'VE GOT MORE PASSION IN ME
THAN EVERY ONE OF THESE [bleep].

39:29.825 --> 39:33.829
THIS MEANS MORE TO ME THAN
ANYTHING IN THE GODDAMN WORLD.

39:33.913 --> 39:34.705
I BELONG HERE.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.749
- BUT WILL YOU MAKE IT
TO THE FINALE

39:36.832 --> 39:38.417
NOT KNOWING HOW TO
PUT ON A STENCIL?

39:38.501 --> 39:39.460
I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.

39:39.543 --> 39:40.836
- LET ME PROVE YOU WRONG, THEN.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.882
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:49.053 --> 39:53.933
EMILY, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:54.016 --> 39:56.143
- YOU MADE SOME VERY BAD
DESIGN EFFORTS TODAY.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.353
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GOING HOME.

39:57.436 --> 39:59.563
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:04.443 --> 40:07.822
- I'M GOING HOME FOR A TATTOO
THAT SHOWED GRADATION,

40:07.905 --> 40:11.826
AND MARK GETS AWAY
WITH SOME SOLID BLACK CRAP?

40:11.909 --> 40:15.830
IT'S RIDICULOUS,
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.581
THE WICKED WITCH WILL NEVER DIE.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.797
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:24.880 --> 40:25.840
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:25.923 --> 40:28.551
- YEAH, SORRY.
I CAN'T CONTROL MY TWITCHING.

40:28.634 --> 40:29.593
- YOU'RE A [bleep] LIAR.

40:29.677 --> 40:30.636
YOU'RE A [bleep] CHEAT.

40:30.719 --> 40:31.637
- YOU GONNA CHEAT?

40:31.720 --> 40:33.055
PAY THE [bleep] PIPER
OR GO HOME.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.723
- I HELPED YOU BY NOT BEATING
YOUR [bleep] HEAD INTO THE WALL.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.892
PUNK BITCH.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.395
- THIS TATTOO DID NOT HAVE
TO LOOK THIS OVERWORKED.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.771
- IT'S INSANE.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.439
- IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT
OF A DISEASE MEDICAL JOURNAL.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.567
- IT'S JUST GONNA
GET TOUGHER AND TOUGHER.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.193
- EXCUSE ME.
CAN I--CAN I SPEAK?

40:46.277 --> 40:48.988
I WAS CONFRONTED
BY MY FELLOW ARTISTS

40:49.071 --> 40:50.072
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT I'VE BEEN DOING

40:50.156 --> 40:51.031
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.617
IT IS A BREACH OF
THE RULES.
