WEBVTT

00:02.061 --> 00:04.628
(rumbling)

00:14.831 --> 00:17.599
(gasping)

00:21.022 --> 00:22.563
(keypad beeping)

00:29.697 --> 00:31.196
GRACE RYDER:
Alright, I'm sending police
right to you, ma'am.

00:31.348 --> 00:32.923
-What's your name?
-LILA GERALDS (on phone):<i> Lila.</i>

00:32.941 --> 00:34.182
<i> Lila Geralds.</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:35.442
Now, Lila, my name is Grace.

00:35.594 --> 00:37.110
I'm gonna sit
on the phone with you, okay,

00:37.187 --> 00:38.186
until help arrives.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.946
Now, don't confront the suspect.

00:40.099 --> 00:41.189
Are you someplace
safe for now?

00:41.283 --> 00:42.524
LILA:
<i> I'm in the house.</i>

00:42.618 --> 00:44.376
And can you see the thieves
from where you are?

00:44.528 --> 00:46.620
LILA:
<i> No, but I know who it is.</i>

00:46.696 --> 00:49.048
Okay, Lila, I need the address
to where you're calling from.

00:49.124 --> 00:50.507
LILA:
<i> I don't know.</i>

00:52.127 --> 00:53.460
I thought you said
you were in your house.

00:53.612 --> 00:56.764
I am. That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

00:57.633 --> 00:58.448
(rumbling)

00:58.467 --> 01:00.284
My house isn't being robbed.

01:00.286 --> 01:02.519
It's being stolen.

01:06.475 --> 01:09.693
(theme music plays)

01:11.630 --> 01:14.073
Okay, Lila, based on
the landmarks you've given me,

01:14.224 --> 01:16.575
I've got you on Highway 9
going north.

01:16.652 --> 01:18.652
<i> Now, you said</i>
<i> you have a good idea</i>

01:18.728 --> 01:20.079
of who's driving
the truck, right?

01:20.155 --> 01:22.139
Yeah. I've got
an idea, alright.

01:22.157 --> 01:24.491
It's my ex-husband, Mitch!

01:24.643 --> 01:26.109
Ugh!

01:26.161 --> 01:30.071
Oh, yep, that's the back
of his fat head.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.239
(Lila grunts)

01:31.258 --> 01:33.817
He is stealing my house
with me in it!

01:33.836 --> 01:34.835
(screaming)

01:34.987 --> 01:35.836
Lila, what's happening?

01:35.930 --> 01:37.412
(screaming continues)

01:37.489 --> 01:39.747
All the furniture's
sliding around!

01:39.767 --> 01:42.342
Listen, try to find someplace
safe to hunker down, okay?

01:42.419 --> 01:44.010
Police and rescue
are on their way.

01:44.163 --> 01:45.587
-(siren wailing)
-(horn blares)

01:45.664 --> 01:49.257
Dispatch, ladder 126.
Highway 9, Mile Marker 16.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.852
Yeah. He's about two miles
in front of you, Captain Strand.

01:52.004 --> 01:53.337
<i> So just maintain speed</i>
<i> and wait for instructions.</i>

01:53.339 --> 01:54.446
-We'll do that.
-PAUL STRICKLAND: Yo, so

01:54.598 --> 01:56.431
how does somebody
hitch up your whole house

01:56.508 --> 01:57.674
with you inside
and drive off

01:57.676 --> 01:59.359
and you sleep through
the whole thing?

01:59.436 --> 02:00.452
I don't know.
To hear Grace tell it,
I could sleep

02:00.604 --> 02:02.121
through a stampede
and still be snoring.

02:02.272 --> 02:04.348
So how are we supposed
to stop him, Cap?

02:04.366 --> 02:06.792
Not our job.
We're just here for the cleanup.

02:06.869 --> 02:08.627
(siren wailing)

02:12.466 --> 02:13.757
(siren chirps)

02:15.060 --> 02:16.618
Pull to the shoulder now!

02:16.695 --> 02:18.879
-No offense, officer, I'm good.
-SGT. TY O'BRIEN: Pull over.

02:19.031 --> 02:20.347
But you have a nice day.

02:21.291 --> 02:22.716
Three-three-one-M-40.

02:22.868 --> 02:27.037
Be advised, suspect has
refused to obey a traffic stop.

02:27.039 --> 02:28.388
PAUL:
Is that Sergeant O'Brien?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.131
Dude's definitely
getting a ticket.

02:30.209 --> 02:31.316
Captain Strand, 126.

02:31.393 --> 02:32.542
Hey, do you think
we should let

02:32.561 --> 02:33.727
the driver go
to wherever he's going?

02:33.803 --> 02:35.487
<i> Or do you think PD</i>
<i> needs to force a stop?</i>

02:35.639 --> 02:37.397
Can't say I'm fond
of either option, Captain.

02:37.474 --> 02:39.491
<i> He's got about 15 feet</i>
<i> of house that looks like</i>

02:39.568 --> 02:42.703
it's one bump away from turning
into a pile of matchsticks.

02:45.315 --> 02:47.407
Hey, you force a stop,
you could kill the wife.

02:47.484 --> 02:48.725
PAUL: Yeah, but you
leave him on the road,

02:48.727 --> 02:50.076
he can kill somebody else.

02:50.229 --> 02:52.320
Dispatch, any chance the wife
knows where he's going?

02:52.398 --> 02:54.231
GRACE (over radio):
<i> Stand by, 126. I'll ask.</i>

02:54.249 --> 02:56.416
Lila, would you know
where Mitch is taking the house?

02:56.493 --> 02:59.827
I know he bought an empty lot
up at Birch Glen.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.180
Birch Glen, Captain.

03:01.256 --> 03:02.848
<i> And I do see</i>
<i> a trailer park there.</i>

03:02.925 --> 03:04.183
Birch Glen. Hey-hey, Cap.

03:04.334 --> 03:06.092
To get to Birch Glen,
he's gonna have to exit

03:06.169 --> 03:07.186
Highway 9 and take 290.

03:07.262 --> 03:09.396
Get a look at Mile Marker 23.

03:10.098 --> 03:11.857
See where it's going?

03:11.934 --> 03:13.750
Strickland, that is genius.

03:13.769 --> 03:15.936
-He's headed to Birch Glen.
-He'll have to take the 290.

03:16.088 --> 03:18.346
OWEN STRAND (over radio):
<i> That's what we're thinking.</i>
<i> Mile Marker 23?</i>

03:18.365 --> 03:19.606
O'BRIEN:
<i> Yeah, I know it well.</i>

03:19.683 --> 03:20.515
This ends there.

03:20.759 --> 03:22.275
I'll have a party
waiting for him.

03:22.352 --> 03:24.369
OWEN (over radio):
<i> See you there.</i>

03:24.446 --> 03:26.205
Alright, we got
less than 12 clear miles

03:26.356 --> 03:27.522
to extract the wife.

03:27.616 --> 03:30.542
Dispatch, I think we're
gonna need another ride.

03:33.863 --> 03:36.173
(helicopter blades whirring)

03:39.945 --> 03:41.778
TK STRAND (over radio):
<i> Bet you've never</i>
<i> been lowered down</i>

03:41.797 --> 03:42.946
<i> onto a moving house before.</i>

03:42.965 --> 03:46.058
-How much you got?
-Really?

03:46.134 --> 03:48.393
Dude, Google some flood rescues.

03:48.971 --> 03:50.712
Florida. Right.

03:50.731 --> 03:54.399
Ugh.
Of course, missing the mark
over water's one thing.

03:54.551 --> 03:56.793
Pretty sure pavement
would hurt more.

03:56.812 --> 03:58.528
Then don't miss, Marj.

04:05.471 --> 04:08.580
Nice and easy,
target's the skylight.

04:10.492 --> 04:12.000
-(tires screech)
-Oh!

04:14.146 --> 04:15.903
MARJAN MARWANI (over radio):
<i> I've got a moving</i>
<i> target here, Cap.</i>

04:15.923 --> 04:17.314
Alright, pull me up
alongside the cab.

04:17.499 --> 04:20.408
<i> Hey, uh, dispatch, can you</i>
<i> patch me in to the husband?</i>

04:20.486 --> 04:23.262
Yeah, I'll try calling
his cell phone, 126.

04:23.413 --> 04:24.912
<i> There's no guarantee</i>
<i> he'll answer though.</i>

04:24.932 --> 04:27.841
(siren wailing)

04:27.993 --> 04:29.351
(horn blares)

04:32.831 --> 04:34.564
(ringing)

04:35.925 --> 04:36.850
Hey!

04:36.926 --> 04:38.527
(ringing continues)

04:39.004 --> 04:39.927
Hey.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.763
(ringing continues)

04:41.840 --> 04:44.283
-MITCH: What?
-You aware that
your wife's in the house?

04:44.434 --> 04:46.176
Well, it's my house.
I paid for it.

04:46.194 --> 04:49.288
Okay. It's Mitch, right?
Mitch, listen to me.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.790
I've had two divorces.
I know things can get ugly.

04:51.867 --> 04:54.851
But it could get a lot uglier
if somebody gets hurt, or worse.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.278
I suppose she told you
the judge gave her the house?

04:57.298 --> 04:58.946
It really didn't come up.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.357
MITCH:
<i> Well, it's a lie.</i>

05:00.375 --> 05:03.135
<i> The judge said</i>
<i> she could stay in the house.</i>

05:03.244 --> 05:05.971
<i>-So, fine.</i>
-MARJAN: Okay, over the target.

05:06.048 --> 05:07.881
Lila, are you near the skylight?

05:07.957 --> 05:09.549
Yeah, I'm looking
right at it.

05:09.701 --> 05:10.517
Move.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.644
(grunts)

05:14.315 --> 05:17.107
Ah! Who's going to pay for that?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.469
I'm here to rescue you!

05:21.488 --> 05:22.379
LILA:
Rescue me?

05:22.397 --> 05:24.881
No, I don't need to be rescued!

05:24.883 --> 05:26.232
He needs to be arrested!

05:26.309 --> 05:27.734
Yeah, I feel like
that's probably in the cards.

05:27.811 --> 05:30.978
But for now, we need
to get you outta here, okay?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.572
-No!
-No?

05:32.724 --> 05:34.333
I am not leaving this house!

05:34.409 --> 05:36.317
The judge said
I didn't have to.

05:36.395 --> 05:38.152
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law!

05:38.230 --> 05:40.988
I am standing my ground!

05:41.066 --> 05:42.132
Oh!

05:44.570 --> 05:45.344
You can go.

05:45.495 --> 05:47.512
Hey, Marjan,
what's the holdup?

05:47.589 --> 05:51.257
Slight holdup being
that she's a crazy lady, Cap.

05:51.334 --> 05:53.852
Well, you've got about
a half a mile to figure it out.

05:53.929 --> 05:54.928
MARJAN:<i> Listen!</i>

05:55.004 --> 05:56.262
In about 60 seconds,

05:56.357 --> 05:59.024
you'll be the proud owner
of nine-tenths of nothing!

05:59.101 --> 06:01.084
We need to get you
in this harness

06:01.103 --> 06:02.861
and get you outta here, okay?

06:03.012 --> 06:04.363
(screams)

06:05.774 --> 06:07.257
-Come on!
-Fine!

06:07.275 --> 06:09.201
-He can have it!
-Okay.

06:09.277 --> 06:10.276
-Come through here.
-(groans)

06:10.353 --> 06:12.496
Coming up on that exit,
Marwani.

06:14.266 --> 06:17.450
Okay, copy that, Cap.
We're ready. Take us up.

06:17.603 --> 06:19.169
-Hold on tight.
-Okay.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.967
TK (over radio):
<i> Marwani and the wife</i>
<i> are out, Cap.</i>

06:27.963 --> 06:29.388
Sergeant, the wife is clear.

06:29.615 --> 06:33.308
<i> Mitch and his 15-foot house</i>
<i> is headed for 290.</i>

06:35.303 --> 06:37.804
<i> How's our</i>
<i> party planning coming?</i>

06:37.956 --> 06:39.064
Everything's in place.

06:39.215 --> 06:41.316
(indistinct yelling)

06:47.741 --> 06:49.616
You sons of bitches.

06:51.394 --> 06:54.729
Better move.
I'm not stopping for anything.

06:54.806 --> 06:56.456
(engine revving)

06:57.066 --> 06:58.333
Here he comes.

07:02.405 --> 07:03.630
(tires screech)

07:08.336 --> 07:09.094
Let's go.

07:09.245 --> 07:10.353
OFFICER:
Move, move, move!

07:10.355 --> 07:11.671
-Hurry up.
-Let's see those hands.

07:11.823 --> 07:12.989
Keep 'em up.

07:12.991 --> 07:15.600
-(siren wailing)
-(horn blares)

07:15.752 --> 07:16.843
OFFICER:
Keep your hands up!

07:16.920 --> 07:19.212
(indistinct yelling)

07:19.364 --> 07:21.606
So that's what's at
Mile Marker 23.

07:21.758 --> 07:23.400
Yeah, I'll be a son of a gun.

07:25.854 --> 07:27.687
Well played, Strand.

07:27.764 --> 07:29.781
I owe you a beer.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.491
I plan on collecting.

07:39.034 --> 07:41.275
Captain Strand,
this is Special Agent Biondi,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.186
my partner on
the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

07:43.188 --> 07:44.704
OWEN:
Nice to meet you.
Uh, l-listen.

07:44.856 --> 07:47.207
Please don't take this as me
telling you how to do your job,

07:47.283 --> 07:50.543
but I think there must be
some misunderstanding here.

07:50.696 --> 07:52.879
Did you tell anyone else
you'd be meeting with us today?

07:52.956 --> 07:54.380
Your partner told me not to,

07:54.457 --> 07:56.866
and, um, that's about
all she's told me.

07:56.868 --> 07:59.052
Captain, these men
you've been associating with,

07:59.128 --> 08:01.796
the Honor Dogs,
what do you know about them?

08:01.815 --> 08:02.889
See, I think the phrase

08:03.041 --> 08:05.132
"associating with"
is misleading.

08:05.210 --> 08:07.486
I've ridden with these guys
a couple times,

08:07.562 --> 08:10.322
and as far as I can tell,
they're motorcycle enthusiasts

08:10.398 --> 08:14.809
who like to brand each other
from time to time.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.069
So I don't know much.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.222
The Honor Dogs are
a group of fringe separatists

08:19.224 --> 08:22.075
whose stated goal is the return
of the state of Texas

08:22.227 --> 08:24.227
-to its founding fathers.
-The Mexicans?

08:24.246 --> 08:25.504
They skip right
to the Alamo part.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.339
But they know
how it ended, right?

08:27.566 --> 08:29.749
About a year ago,
they landed on our
domestic terror watch list.

08:29.901 --> 08:30.992
Yeah, well,
so did a bunch of parents

08:31.086 --> 08:32.511
protesting
a school board meeting,
if I recall.

08:32.754 --> 08:35.180
AGENT ROSE KACEY:
Recently, their
online rhetoric has become

08:35.257 --> 08:37.574
increasingly more hostile
toward the government,

08:37.592 --> 08:40.977
and there has been
a lot more of this.

08:42.931 --> 08:44.247
Well, it is Texas.

08:44.266 --> 08:46.432
We have reason to believe
your new pals

08:46.509 --> 08:49.919
are planning
an attack here in Austin.

08:49.938 --> 08:51.178
Ever heard of ANFO?

08:51.256 --> 08:52.680
Ammonium nitrate
fuel-oil mixture?

08:52.774 --> 08:56.517
Six weeks ago, a truckload
was hijacked outside of Laredo.

08:56.595 --> 08:58.686
Timothy McVeigh used
4,800 pounds of it

08:58.764 --> 09:01.097
to take down
the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building

09:01.116 --> 09:02.189
in Oklahoma City.

09:02.267 --> 09:04.042
This truck was carrying

09:04.193 --> 09:05.435
three times that amount.

09:05.437 --> 09:07.120
If you think they have this,

09:07.272 --> 09:08.195
what do you need me for?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.530
Go get a warrant and get it.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.124
We don't have quite enough
for a warrant yet.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.051
And that's why
we're asking for your help.

09:13.202 --> 09:16.596
We want you to plant this.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.115
Ooh. Is this a--

09:19.134 --> 09:20.784
An RF transmitter.

09:20.786 --> 09:21.968
Ooh, it's teeny.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.303
Teeny-weensy.

09:23.379 --> 09:25.230
We need someone who can
walk into that roadhouse

09:25.381 --> 09:27.715
without questions being asked.
That someone is you.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.642
AGENT CHUCK BIONDI:
We learned from a source
there's an office in the back

09:29.736 --> 09:32.812
opposite the men's room
where all the private
conversations take place.

09:32.889 --> 09:33.929
The men's room?

09:33.965 --> 09:35.481
The private office.

09:35.634 --> 09:37.150
That's where we want you
to plant the bug.

09:37.302 --> 09:38.468
Okay, but if you have a source,

09:38.486 --> 09:40.136
why not just use the source?

09:40.138 --> 09:41.654
He's no longer available.

09:41.731 --> 09:46.067
Meaning they're...
no longer as alive
as they used to be?

09:46.144 --> 09:48.645
-You're in, you're out, easy.
-Huh.

09:48.663 --> 09:50.980
AGENT BIONDI:
Back of a framed picture
is always good.

09:50.999 --> 09:53.240
Top of a light fixture
if it doesn't look like
it gets dusted.

09:53.318 --> 09:55.135
Or just under a table.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.320
ROSE: Owen...

09:57.339 --> 10:00.348
you know the kind of devastation
we could be looking at.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.434
We need your help.

10:06.714 --> 10:10.091
Yes. No, I'm sure it would have
made a great Instagram post,

10:10.110 --> 10:11.668
but it is mating season.

10:11.686 --> 10:13.278
It just makes 'em
a little more aggressive.

10:13.429 --> 10:15.780
Yeah, so just
keep on runnin', Muriel.

10:16.007 --> 10:17.699
Park management
is on its way.

10:20.103 --> 10:21.845
Uh, no, actually, if it's a he,

10:21.863 --> 10:23.455
then the bird has
beautiful tail feathers.

10:23.606 --> 10:25.290
The lady birds
are the drab ones.

10:25.367 --> 10:28.609
I know it seems wrong,
but nature is sometimes cruel.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.353
Just-- Yeah, just
keep running, Muriel.

10:30.446 --> 10:32.522
You're almost near the toilets?

10:32.540 --> 10:34.782
Perfect. Just get in there
and shut the door, okay?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.134
You stay put.

10:36.285 --> 10:37.118
Yeah, Animal Control
will let you know

10:37.195 --> 10:38.194
when it's safe to come out.

10:38.287 --> 10:40.530
Okay. Alright,
you're very welcome.

10:40.548 --> 10:42.882
-You have a good day.
-(key clacks)

10:43.034 --> 10:44.367
My money's on the peacock.

10:44.386 --> 10:47.145
-Girl, mine, too.
-(laughter)

10:47.296 --> 10:50.148
Hey, listen,
I'm going on break, okay?

10:50.299 --> 10:51.465
How much time we got?

10:51.485 --> 10:54.986
So you should have seen
the way Reverend Parks

10:55.138 --> 10:56.971
smooth-talked Mrs. Barnum.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.048
By the end of it,
she thought it was her idea

10:59.050 --> 11:00.808
to step down
from welcoming chair.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.977
And now the woman's
only bringing drinks.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.019
(Tommy gasps)

11:04.021 --> 11:05.555
-Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah.

11:05.557 --> 11:08.166
-(Tommy clears throat)
-You missed quite a meeting.

11:08.317 --> 11:10.410
I had something to do
with the girls last night.

11:10.486 --> 11:12.486
So, did you know

11:12.506 --> 11:15.081
that Reverend Parks
had a BA in astronomy?

11:15.158 --> 11:16.399
Oh, that's very interesting.

11:16.418 --> 11:17.509
-I thought so, too.
-TOMMY VEGA: Mm-hmm.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.660
GRACE: Personally, me,

11:19.738 --> 11:22.013
I could've listened
to the man all day.

11:22.165 --> 11:23.831
What are you doing?
Right now?

11:23.909 --> 11:25.475
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

11:27.595 --> 11:31.338
Um, I was trying to see
if he called you

11:31.416 --> 11:33.174
after you gave him
your phone number.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.417
You know he called me.

11:34.436 --> 11:35.752
Yes. Okay, he might
have mentioned it.

11:35.770 --> 11:40.256
Mm-hmm. And, no. No,
I have not called him back yet.

11:40.258 --> 11:41.515
It's complicated, Gracie.

11:41.593 --> 11:42.516
That's just your catchphrase

11:42.610 --> 11:44.260
for when things
aren't complicated.

11:44.262 --> 11:47.263
But you're avoiding them
because you're being a chicken.

11:47.265 --> 11:49.541
Well, I didn't know I had
a catchphrase for all that.

11:49.692 --> 11:50.950
-He's handsome.
-Yes.

11:51.102 --> 11:52.193
GRACE:
And he's fascinating.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.028
And we know he loves kids.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.214
So, I guess I do see
your dilemma.

11:56.365 --> 11:58.049
(softly): He's a pastor.

11:58.126 --> 12:00.367
He's<i> my</i> pastor.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.445
And this chicken
is a little concerned

12:02.447 --> 12:03.871
about all the hens at church.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.223
GRACE:
Oh, my gosh. Oh,

12:05.374 --> 12:07.058
-let them cluck.
-I don't need it.

12:07.135 --> 12:10.729
No, let them cluck.
You like him, right?

12:10.880 --> 12:13.306
-I hardly know the man.
-You should get to know him.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.975
Something compelled you
to give him your phone number.

12:16.052 --> 12:17.760
It wasn't the Holy Spirit.

12:17.796 --> 12:19.220
(laughter)

12:19.239 --> 12:20.221
Okay.

12:20.298 --> 12:22.240
You saying
that's the only reason?

12:22.391 --> 12:24.409
Not the only reason, no, but...

12:26.229 --> 12:27.971
-Imma tell you the truth.
-Hm?

12:27.989 --> 12:28.988
It could be a deal breaker.

12:29.065 --> 12:30.231
GRACE:
Hmm, it doesn't have to be.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.000
Me and Judd, we did wait...

12:32.994 --> 12:34.252
until our wedding night.

12:34.329 --> 12:36.646
Yeah, I love that for you.

12:36.664 --> 12:41.150
But I've already had
my wedding night, and I...

12:41.244 --> 12:43.261
I don't know
if I'll marry again.

12:43.338 --> 12:46.347
Gracie, I-I can't
actually imagine it.

12:47.492 --> 12:51.511
But I do know
this stage in my life,

12:51.587 --> 12:55.014
I need something more than
just a dinner companion.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.682
I understand.

12:56.835 --> 12:58.017
But you're right.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.168
He did give me his number,

12:59.187 --> 12:59.944
and I do need to call him

13:00.096 --> 13:01.170
to tell him I'm not interested.

13:01.264 --> 13:03.448
So then you're just
gonna bold-face lie

13:03.599 --> 13:05.366
to the man of God then?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.163
(Tommy sighs)

13:13.184 --> 13:15.293
Well, how's this one?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.855
It's as good as the last three.

13:18.857 --> 13:19.798
As good?

13:19.949 --> 13:21.190
It's better. It's perfect.

13:21.192 --> 13:22.358
God, why am I so nervous?

13:22.377 --> 13:23.784
I feel like
I'm meeting your parents.

13:23.804 --> 13:24.877
(scoffs)

13:25.030 --> 13:26.212
Not my parents.

13:26.364 --> 13:28.431
-Just my wife.
-Ha.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.218
Hey, remember what I said?

13:32.370 --> 13:33.478
Her meds tend to
remove the filter.

13:33.555 --> 13:36.205
She can be blunt,
but not malicious.

13:36.224 --> 13:38.041
Don't take it personally.

13:38.043 --> 13:39.442
-TK: Okay.
-Okay?

13:40.211 --> 13:41.486
You're all good.

13:43.882 --> 13:44.489
(exhales sharply)

13:44.640 --> 13:45.715
This place is really nice.

13:45.717 --> 13:47.717
It's much nicer
than my last place.

13:47.735 --> 13:48.827
Where was that?

13:48.978 --> 13:50.553
Under an overpass.

13:50.572 --> 13:51.329
Right.

13:51.406 --> 13:54.815
So... you wanna get married?

13:54.835 --> 13:56.033
That's the plan.

13:56.186 --> 13:57.460
-CARLOS REYES: Yeah.
-Why?

13:58.396 --> 13:59.337
Why?

13:59.414 --> 14:00.913
Hmm. Seems like you already are.

14:01.066 --> 14:03.066
Um, we wanna
make it official.

14:03.084 --> 14:05.343
-For tax purposes?
-No.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.070
Carlos said that you
used to be a firefighter,

14:07.163 --> 14:08.012
now you're a paramedic.

14:08.164 --> 14:09.663
Don't they make less?

14:09.683 --> 14:11.074
No, I-I do okay.

14:11.076 --> 14:12.408
Is it because you're short?

14:12.410 --> 14:13.667
Uh...

14:13.687 --> 14:15.078
I don't think I'm short.

14:15.096 --> 14:17.430
Was it because being
a paramedic is less dangerous?

14:17.506 --> 14:19.691
I mean, some people
would say that's cowardly,

14:19.918 --> 14:20.933
but I don't think so.

14:21.010 --> 14:22.110
I think it's smart.

14:25.757 --> 14:29.108
No, I, uh, I felt
that it was my calling.

14:29.185 --> 14:31.852
And, um, being a paramedic
at the 126

14:31.930 --> 14:33.872
comes with plenty of danger.

14:33.948 --> 14:37.116
The paramedic TK replaced
got killed in the field.

14:37.193 --> 14:38.525
That's so sad.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.436
Yeah. By a lava bomb.

14:40.438 --> 14:41.954
That's cool.
But still sad.

14:42.107 --> 14:43.548
And last year,
during the blizzard,

14:43.699 --> 14:46.367
I was rescuing a kid
trapped under the ice

14:46.386 --> 14:48.219
and I got
really bad hypothermia,

14:48.296 --> 14:51.222
ended up in a coma
and almost died, so...

14:51.299 --> 14:53.057
I thought you were shot.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.210
That was the other coma.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.954
How many comas
have you been in?

14:58.123 --> 15:03.884
Oh, just the three,
but only two since
I moved to Texas. So, yeah.

15:03.962 --> 15:05.294
That seems like a lot of comas.

15:05.313 --> 15:07.463
Yeah, it's a bit
more than average.

15:07.556 --> 15:09.966
Iris, TK and I
wanna get married

15:09.968 --> 15:11.058
because we love each other

15:11.469 --> 15:13.077
and because we wanna spend
the rest of our lives together.

15:13.154 --> 15:15.062
It's no more complicated
than that.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.247
It is a little
more complicated

15:16.399 --> 15:17.999
'cause you're already married.

15:18.826 --> 15:20.826
Which is why you're here.

15:20.979 --> 15:22.420
-That's true.
-CARLOS: Yeah.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.344
-Divorce papers?
-Yes. Yes.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.008
Here you go.

15:36.085 --> 15:37.326
-Thank you.
-TK: Here's a pen.

15:37.345 --> 15:39.354
I don't need a pen.
I have pens.

15:40.498 --> 15:41.330
TK: Wh-what?

15:41.349 --> 15:42.756
You're not gonna sign it now?

15:42.834 --> 15:44.275
No, I need to read it,
you know, think it over.

15:44.427 --> 15:45.668
What is there
to think about it?

15:45.761 --> 15:47.261
Are you guys gonna eat those?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.021
I don't see you doing
a lot of carbs.

15:49.174 --> 15:50.097
You can take them.

15:50.175 --> 15:51.857
You want a bag or--

15:51.934 --> 15:53.009
No, I'm good.

15:53.011 --> 15:54.327
Oh.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.013
Carlos, let's do this
again sometime.

15:57.015 --> 15:58.848
CARLOS: Yeah.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.500
You're always welcome here.

16:01.519 --> 16:02.443
-TK.
-TK: Mm-hmm.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.128
-Pleasure to meet you.
-TK: Mm-hmm.

16:05.039 --> 16:06.673
You're exactly what I expected.

16:08.376 --> 16:09.550
Bye!

16:15.717 --> 16:16.808
What the hell just happened?

16:16.959 --> 16:18.476
(exhales deeply)

16:19.128 --> 16:20.561
Iris happened.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.154
She'll think about it?
What does that even mean?

16:30.231 --> 16:32.490
Getting divorced
from a gay husband

16:32.641 --> 16:34.141
doesn't seem like
there's much to think about.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.901
I mean, it's not like
she can force Carlos

16:36.054 --> 16:36.977
to stay married to her.

16:37.055 --> 16:38.145
No, but she could
drag it out,

16:38.223 --> 16:39.238
and then we'll lose the venue.

16:39.315 --> 16:40.498
I mean,
she's holding our wedding

16:40.575 --> 16:42.408
completely hostage
for no good reason.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.559
-So don't let her.
-(TK sighs)

16:43.561 --> 16:45.319
You can still have
the wedding, TK.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.563
She can't stop it
from happening.

16:47.565 --> 16:49.656
And then you can sort out
the legalities later.

16:49.734 --> 16:51.825
No. Nance, I'm not
gonna do that, alright?

16:51.903 --> 16:55.346
We have fought so hard
to have our marriages
legally recognized.

16:55.498 --> 16:59.100
When I say "I do," I want
the world to know that I did.

17:00.002 --> 17:01.093
I get that.

17:01.170 --> 17:02.169
You know
what she said last night

17:02.188 --> 17:04.004
when she left our place?

17:04.024 --> 17:05.172
-Good night?
-No.

17:05.341 --> 17:08.417
She said that I was exactly
what she expected.

17:08.436 --> 17:09.736
What do you make of that?

17:12.924 --> 17:14.090
It's a pretty
neutral statement.

17:14.092 --> 17:17.927
It was ominous, Nance.
It was very ominous.

17:17.929 --> 17:19.579
Why don't you ask her
what she meant?

17:19.873 --> 17:21.122
Hmm?

17:22.024 --> 17:23.599
Hey, now.

17:23.618 --> 17:25.859
-Uh, Cap?
-Hey.

17:25.937 --> 17:27.712
Frog Prince at ten o'clock.

17:27.863 --> 17:29.589
(inaudible)

17:31.033 --> 17:33.384
Ugh, that's Reverend Parks.

17:33.461 --> 17:34.777
-Reverend?
-Believe it or not,

17:34.796 --> 17:37.280
he is the new pastor
at my church.

17:37.282 --> 17:40.433
You came on to the pastor
at your church?

17:41.286 --> 17:42.393
You're going to hell.

17:42.470 --> 17:43.953
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:43.955 --> 17:45.396
Cyanokit restock right now.

17:45.473 --> 17:46.972
Get lost. Okay.

17:47.049 --> 17:48.382
Hey. Hey.

17:48.476 --> 17:51.977
Reverend Parks
right here where I work.

17:52.054 --> 17:53.404
If I recall on Sunday,

17:53.481 --> 17:55.389
you showed up
at my place of business.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.574
Yes, I did.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.077
But you slipped right out
before we could talk.

17:59.228 --> 18:00.227
Well, you were busy.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.987
Y-You were greeting
the congregation

18:02.064 --> 18:02.914
on their way out,

18:03.065 --> 18:07.085
and we had already met...
twice.

18:07.236 --> 18:09.128
But I-I did enjoy the show.

18:09.905 --> 18:11.089
Not show.

18:11.165 --> 18:12.924
-Uh, um...
-Sermon?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.243
Yes, it was solid.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.079
And solemn even and--

18:19.099 --> 18:20.264
But funny.

18:20.416 --> 18:22.508
It-- Oh, God.
Please stop me.

18:22.660 --> 18:25.085
-Just, please.
-And miss what comes next?

18:25.163 --> 18:27.163
-No, ma'am.
-TOMMY: I just--

18:27.165 --> 18:28.998
I need to apologize,

18:29.016 --> 18:30.942
uh, because when I,
when I gave you my number,

18:31.018 --> 18:33.027
I-I didn't realize who...

18:34.505 --> 18:35.446
you work for.

18:35.598 --> 18:36.930
My boss, you mean?

18:36.950 --> 18:38.674
Yes. God. Man upstairs.

18:38.693 --> 18:42.695
One who sees everything,
including your thoughts.

18:42.771 --> 18:45.498
I'd like to think it was God
who brought us together.

18:45.867 --> 18:47.291
Twice.

18:47.443 --> 18:49.443
But did He have to
put your life in peril?

18:49.445 --> 18:51.111
Oh, He works
in mysterious ways.

18:51.189 --> 18:52.188
And I've heard that.

18:52.190 --> 18:54.357
And He tends to get
what He wants.

18:54.375 --> 18:57.093
So will you have dinner with me?

18:59.881 --> 19:01.347
Alright.

19:02.550 --> 19:03.866
Yes.

19:03.885 --> 19:05.201
Dinner.

19:05.219 --> 19:07.052
-I'd love to.
-How's Thursday?

19:07.205 --> 19:10.389
Thursday, uh, is good.
(laughs)

19:10.541 --> 19:14.059
Yes. Um, text me
and I'll send you my address.

19:14.136 --> 19:16.028
Amen, I will do that.

19:17.048 --> 19:18.364
Well, um...

19:19.901 --> 19:20.974
You have a blessed day.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.451
You, too.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.377
Ooh, you're gonna burn.

19:34.582 --> 19:38.176

MIKEY:
Captain Strand?

20:05.279 --> 20:06.353
Hey, Mikey, remember?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.206
Oh, yeah, sure.
Just call me Owen.

20:08.399 --> 20:09.373
Sorry we didn't
get a chance to talk

20:09.542 --> 20:11.617
after the branding ceremony
the other night.

20:11.694 --> 20:14.270
Yeah, the guy I was with,
he's, uh, got a wife and kids,

20:14.288 --> 20:16.088
-so we had to run.
-RED: Strand.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.199
I didn't really expect
to see you in here again.

20:19.277 --> 20:20.943
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

20:20.945 --> 20:22.220
Maybe it was the way
you and Easy Ryder

20:22.371 --> 20:24.280
ran out of here last time.

20:24.298 --> 20:26.432
I don't know about "ran out."

20:27.134 --> 20:28.284
What brings you back?

20:28.286 --> 20:29.468
Actually, something you said.

20:29.545 --> 20:31.545
RED:
Is that right?
What was that?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.973
"Bar's always open,
drinks are always free."

20:34.049 --> 20:37.026
Ha, ha!
Well, let's get you
watered down, then.

20:40.648 --> 20:43.890
Sorry, I, uh, probably should
have given you a heads-up.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.409
It can be pretty startling

20:45.561 --> 20:47.245
seeing a man take the Eagle
for the first time.

20:47.321 --> 20:49.154
Why do I think that
not giving me a heads-up

20:49.231 --> 20:50.397
was the whole point?

20:50.416 --> 20:51.991
(chuckles)

20:52.067 --> 20:52.992
So let me ask you something.

20:53.144 --> 20:54.418
RED: Hmm.

20:54.495 --> 20:55.920
Why the Eagle?

20:55.997 --> 20:58.047
It's the Honor Dogs.
Why not a dog?

20:59.484 --> 21:01.166
Ancient Romans
used to carry an eagle

21:01.243 --> 21:03.094
as their standard in a battle.

21:03.245 --> 21:05.321
Not just the Romans.

21:05.339 --> 21:07.156
You calling me a Nazi, Strand?

21:07.158 --> 21:10.268
You don't seem offput by it.

21:10.344 --> 21:12.328
Hey, anybody to the right
of Trotsky these days

21:12.421 --> 21:13.846
gets called a Nazi, right?

21:13.964 --> 21:16.015
(laughs) Yeah.

21:16.167 --> 21:17.775
Hey, you got a men's room?

21:17.926 --> 21:19.318
It's right back there.

21:25.860 --> 21:27.576
(inaudible)

21:28.346 --> 21:29.578
BIKER:
How's it going?

21:36.612 --> 21:38.462
(tense music playing)

21:52.887 --> 21:54.061
O'BRIEN: Strand.

21:55.631 --> 21:56.647
O'Brien.

21:56.799 --> 21:57.873
O'BRIEN:
What are you doing here?

21:57.966 --> 21:59.708
Uh, I was just looking
for a men's room.

21:59.710 --> 22:02.394
That's behind the door
that says "Toilet."

22:02.471 --> 22:05.990
Oh, well, should've
checked there first.

22:08.143 --> 22:09.160
Say, you gonna be around?

22:09.387 --> 22:12.054
Maybe you can get me
that beer you owe me.

22:12.056 --> 22:13.572
Drinks here are on the house.

22:13.724 --> 22:16.459
Well, then it's a win
for both of us.

22:32.501 --> 22:34.560
(indistinct chatter)

22:37.264 --> 22:40.524
(rock music playing
over speakers)

22:44.939 --> 22:46.155
Thank you.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.576
So this place is pretty poppin'
for a Monday night.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.597
You ever been here
on a Monday night?

22:54.615 --> 22:58.042
Uh, no, but, you know,
for Mondays generally.

22:58.193 --> 23:00.953
-O'Brien, my brother!
-Hey!

23:01.105 --> 23:04.364
Hey.
Like those new bags
you're running on the hog.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.624
-Had to be done.
-TURNER: Yeah.

23:05.701 --> 23:07.534
Chief wouldn't let me
put my Viking studs

23:07.612 --> 23:10.203
on my official
department vehicle.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.797
TURNER:
Be badass if he did, though.

23:11.949 --> 23:13.057
-Right on.
-Alright.

23:15.970 --> 23:17.561
So you're a Dog?
I didn't know.

23:18.806 --> 23:19.955
Honor Dog.

23:19.974 --> 23:21.065
I was abbreviating.

23:21.216 --> 23:23.025
-We don't do that.
-Right.

23:24.052 --> 23:25.444
This place is great, right?

23:27.298 --> 23:28.989
Owen, what the hell
are you doing here?

23:29.800 --> 23:31.075
What do you mean?

23:31.226 --> 23:32.818
You know what kinda
club this is?

23:32.895 --> 23:34.394
A biker club.

23:34.472 --> 23:36.639
-And I have a bike.
-You've got a bike?

23:36.657 --> 23:38.641
Yeah. Bonneville out there.

23:38.734 --> 23:40.476
Was that your
nifty little Triumph upstairs?

23:40.494 --> 23:42.903
-Yeah.
-Yeah. That's about right

23:42.922 --> 23:44.329
for a squid.

23:44.331 --> 23:45.330
A squid?

23:45.407 --> 23:46.674
Let me ask you this.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.593
How did you and the boys meet?

23:49.745 --> 23:50.502
We met on the road.

23:50.596 --> 23:51.987
-On the road?
-OWEN: Mm-hmm.

23:51.989 --> 23:53.914
Just hit it off, you know.

23:53.991 --> 23:55.658
Kinda connection
riders have.

23:55.676 --> 23:56.492
Is that right?

23:56.602 --> 23:57.843
Red even gave me
a Gremlin Bell.

23:57.995 --> 23:59.161
Oh, I'm sure he did.

23:59.163 --> 24:01.087
I bet he was thrilled
to meet you.

24:01.165 --> 24:02.665
Fire captain. 9/11 hero.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.183
He was just talking about
how we need to

24:04.335 --> 24:06.185
start recruiting firefighters.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.003
You guys thinking
of playing with fire?

24:08.096 --> 24:10.030
No. But you might be.

24:11.451 --> 24:15.177
Look, I like you,
Strand, I do.

24:15.196 --> 24:17.270
And I know you're no idiot.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.457
But this isn't a place
that you wanna be.

24:20.518 --> 24:23.127
But it is a place
you wanna be?

24:23.204 --> 24:26.046
TURNER:
Hey, Sergeant, get over here
and lose some money.

24:27.374 --> 24:29.967
Oh, come on, Turner,
you know I always leave here

24:29.969 --> 24:32.118
with more than I came in with.

24:32.196 --> 24:35.030
Finish your beer
and don't ever come back.

24:35.032 --> 24:36.765
You're not welcome here.

24:39.386 --> 24:41.729
Rack 'em up, bitches,
let's lose you some money.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.541
ROSE:
Just relax.

24:45.543 --> 24:48.210
Do you think he saw you
plant the device?

24:48.229 --> 24:50.229
I don't think so.

24:50.305 --> 24:52.397
But are-are you hearing me?

24:52.550 --> 24:55.384
Yeah, I'm hearing you.
It's very echoey in here.

24:55.402 --> 24:56.902
Why are we meeting
in a parking garage?

24:57.054 --> 24:57.978
Have you never seen a movie?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.221
I mean, I couldn't just do it

24:59.240 --> 25:00.072
and then go
right to your office.

25:00.148 --> 25:01.147
What if I was being followed?

25:01.167 --> 25:02.574
Then they would have
followed you here

25:02.727 --> 25:03.650
and seen you meeting with

25:03.744 --> 25:04.985
a federal agent
in a parking garage.

25:05.153 --> 25:07.004
Okay, I'm just saying,
this guy knows me, alright?

25:07.081 --> 25:08.154
He's not buying for a second

25:08.232 --> 25:09.414
that I'm a part
of some extremist group.

25:09.567 --> 25:12.084
Owen, that's fine.
You went in as yourself.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.493
You didn't blow your cover

25:13.513 --> 25:16.013
because there was
no cover to blow.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.499
-What?
-Yeah, I liked the guy.

25:19.577 --> 25:22.353
You know, he's a police officer.
Not just an officer,

25:22.429 --> 25:24.355
a highly decorated
field sergeant.

25:24.431 --> 25:26.357
Why would he hang around
with guys like that?

25:26.433 --> 25:28.584
Who knows why
people do what they do.

25:28.586 --> 25:31.177
You know, every time
I make a new male friend,

25:31.255 --> 25:33.197
it's this
or something like this.

25:33.274 --> 25:35.699
-Do you think it's me?
-I don't really know you.

25:36.594 --> 25:37.276
It's over.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.019
Uh, never really got started.

25:39.096 --> 25:40.946
I mean, we were
just becoming friendly.

25:41.098 --> 25:42.114
I meant the mission.

25:42.266 --> 25:44.708
Look, you planted the device,

25:44.785 --> 25:46.210
you activated it.

25:46.361 --> 25:48.194
That's all we needed from you.

25:48.272 --> 25:50.464
When you say "activated..."

25:52.868 --> 25:53.884
You did turn it on?

25:54.036 --> 25:56.220
No one said anything
about turning it on.

25:56.297 --> 25:58.538
There was a lot of talk
about picture frames

25:58.616 --> 26:00.783
and a place to hide it
and hands,

26:00.785 --> 26:02.542
but nobody even showed me
how to turn it on.

26:02.562 --> 26:03.877
You have to go back in.

26:03.954 --> 26:05.211
Well, I can't. I can't.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.713
O'Brien said I wasn't welcome.

26:06.732 --> 26:07.881
(sighs)

26:07.958 --> 26:09.049
Alright, um, I'll find out

26:09.068 --> 26:10.234
Sergeant O'Brien's schedule.

26:10.477 --> 26:12.903
We'll make sure he's not there
when you go back in.

26:12.980 --> 26:14.697
Just wait to hear from me.

26:17.392 --> 26:19.893
I'm so regretting
buying that bike.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.370
(knock on door)

26:22.915 --> 26:24.164
(sighs)

26:28.329 --> 26:29.903
Hi.

26:29.922 --> 26:30.979
Am I too early?

26:30.998 --> 26:32.497
You're perfect.

26:32.574 --> 26:36.302
(chuckles) I mean,
you're right on time.

26:36.837 --> 26:38.053
Please come in.

26:44.178 --> 26:45.561
TREVOR PARKS: Beautiful.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.400
Absolutely beautiful.

26:54.262 --> 26:56.196
And your house is nice, too.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.451
Reverend. You are a charmer.

27:01.362 --> 27:02.119
Hmm.

27:02.196 --> 27:05.414
That is a lovely jacket.

27:06.183 --> 27:08.033
Do you, um...

27:08.185 --> 27:10.702
preach many a sermon
in that jacket?

27:10.779 --> 27:13.188
Everything that I have
on tonight is secular.

27:13.190 --> 27:14.781
Oh, including your skivvies?

27:14.800 --> 27:16.024
Oh, sister Vega.

27:16.026 --> 27:17.025
(both chuckle)

27:17.044 --> 27:19.544
I'm sorry, I-I can't help it.

27:19.621 --> 27:24.199
The more I tell myself
to be good,
the badder I get.

27:24.218 --> 27:28.145
But I did promise
to be a lady tonight.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.189
Well,

27:30.298 --> 27:34.443
you have got
that part down pat.

27:36.138 --> 27:37.404
You're nervous.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.884
-I'm conflicted.
-Hmm.

27:41.886 --> 27:43.385
I, um, I've never dated a...

27:43.387 --> 27:45.812
-Divorcé.
-...preacher.

27:45.890 --> 27:49.241
Well, I wasn't planning on
doing much preaching tonight.

27:49.393 --> 27:50.751
Amen.

27:53.655 --> 27:54.913
Mm.

27:55.065 --> 27:56.548
Mm-mmm. Uh-huh.

27:57.251 --> 27:58.083
(sighs)

27:58.235 --> 27:59.718
Are we allowed to do this?

28:00.404 --> 28:01.345
When it happens,

28:01.422 --> 28:05.240
just try not to cry out
the Lord's name.

28:05.259 --> 28:08.668
<i> ♪ The only one</i>
<i> who could ever reach me ♪</i>

28:08.688 --> 28:09.761
<i> ♪ Was the son of... ♪</i>

28:09.914 --> 28:11.021
(gasps)

28:11.932 --> 28:13.524
Oh! (heavy breathing)

28:13.675 --> 28:15.083
Yeah.

28:15.102 --> 28:16.176
I'm going to hell.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.253
<i> ♪ Ooh, yes, he was ♪</i>

28:18.255 --> 28:20.680
<i> ♪ The only one who</i>
<i> could ever reach me ♪</i>

28:20.700 --> 28:23.492
<i> ♪ He was the sweet-talking son</i>
<i> of a preacher man ♪</i>

28:29.266 --> 28:32.100
(keyboard keys clacking)

28:32.119 --> 28:34.044
OWEN: "SQUID"?

28:34.121 --> 28:36.880
"Speeding Quickly Until I Die"?

28:37.032 --> 28:39.299
Well, at least I'm not a Nazi.

28:40.961 --> 28:42.702
Hey, Owen. You got a sec?

28:42.722 --> 28:43.887
Yeah. Come in.

28:44.131 --> 28:46.372
It's, um, it's personal.
I-I don't wanna overstep.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.393
Oh, overstepping
is kinda my thing.

28:49.470 --> 28:51.437
Okay. Um, alright.

28:52.214 --> 28:54.547
So, do you know when--

28:54.625 --> 28:57.292
well, in life,
when you meet someone

28:57.294 --> 28:59.886
under a set of circumstances
and you hit it off

28:59.964 --> 29:01.071
and it's great,

29:01.148 --> 29:04.132
and then you,
you run into them again

29:04.134 --> 29:06.301
under a different
set of circumstances,

29:06.320 --> 29:08.078
and it turns out they're not

29:08.155 --> 29:10.414
who you thought
they were at all.

29:10.491 --> 29:11.656
Did he come here?

29:11.733 --> 29:13.825
Actually, uh, yes, he did.

29:13.902 --> 29:15.494
Was he threatening?
Did he ask for me?

29:15.646 --> 29:18.146
Why would Reverend Parks
ask for you?

29:18.148 --> 29:21.091
Wh-- Why would
he be threatening?

29:21.318 --> 29:23.001
There's a chance that
I don't fully understand

29:23.153 --> 29:24.428
what we're talking
about right now.

29:24.579 --> 29:26.263
I'm having sex dreams
about my pastor.

29:26.414 --> 29:27.489
-Ooh. Oh...
-Yeah.

29:27.491 --> 29:29.099
-What are you talking about?
-Well...

29:29.251 --> 29:31.176
I-It's not that,
but I'm-- I'm flattered.

29:31.328 --> 29:32.511
You weren't in the dream.

29:32.587 --> 29:34.480
No, that you chose
to share it with me.

29:35.332 --> 29:36.089
Right.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.258
Well, um, I'd feel dirty

29:38.277 --> 29:39.610
sharing it with anyone else.

29:39.686 --> 29:40.685
Thank you?

29:40.780 --> 29:45.173
I-- Because you're
so wise... like Solomon.

29:45.192 --> 29:46.842
Uh, you know,
that's a Biblical reference,

29:46.860 --> 29:48.527
and I really have
to stop using that.

29:48.679 --> 29:52.014
Listen, do you remember
that very handsome man

29:52.016 --> 29:53.773
who was trapped at the fair?

29:53.793 --> 29:54.458
From the porta-potty?

29:54.609 --> 29:55.793
No.

29:56.128 --> 30:00.280
No. Th-The one who,
uh, who leapt from
the burning Zipper ride?

30:00.357 --> 30:02.132
-Oh, with the daughter.
-TOMMY: Yes. Yes.

30:02.284 --> 30:03.801
I gave him my number.

30:03.877 --> 30:05.052
You gave him your number?

30:06.363 --> 30:08.213
Do you, do you do that a lot?

30:08.365 --> 30:09.455
Give your number out
in the field?

30:09.475 --> 30:10.641
No, and I probably
never will again.

30:10.717 --> 30:13.459
Th-The thing is,
he asked me out on a date.

30:13.537 --> 30:14.369
Because you gave him
your number.

30:14.388 --> 30:15.720
I know. I gave him my number.

30:15.873 --> 30:18.390
And at the time I thought
he was a really hot dad.

30:18.542 --> 30:22.319
And it turns out that he's
the new pastor at my church.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.062
Okay. Um...

30:24.139 --> 30:26.139
(laughs)
Let me ask you
a question.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.491
-TOMMY: Hmm?
-Did the sex dream

30:27.568 --> 30:31.053
start before or after
you knew he was your pastor?

30:31.055 --> 30:32.538
After.

30:33.574 --> 30:35.707
And what was he wearing
in the dreams?

30:37.152 --> 30:38.894
Why does that matter?

30:38.912 --> 30:40.912
It doesn't matter. Um...

30:41.065 --> 30:42.230
Okay.

30:42.249 --> 30:44.324
-Do you like the church?
-TOMMY: Yes.

30:44.401 --> 30:46.159
It's a very important
part of our lives,

30:46.236 --> 30:47.569
and Grace and Judd go there.

30:47.738 --> 30:49.346
Then you have to
say no to the date.
Take it from me.

30:49.539 --> 30:51.406
I made the grave error
of asking out

30:51.408 --> 30:53.333
the receptionist
at my haircutting place.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.335
And if it doesn't work out,
you can't go back.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.412
Not everybody can deal
with my cowlick.

30:57.414 --> 31:00.415
That is the practical
dating advice

31:00.417 --> 31:02.609
that-that I knew I would get.

31:03.921 --> 31:05.028
Thank you.

31:05.698 --> 31:06.738
Just say no.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.032
I already said yes.

31:10.060 --> 31:11.451
Then take backup.

31:19.861 --> 31:21.670
Hey, uh, Iris?

31:22.864 --> 31:24.530
Hey. TK.

31:24.532 --> 31:27.367
-Can we talk?
-Sure, if you can keep up.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.611
Hey, Seth. Hey, have you
seen Donna Burton?

31:29.630 --> 31:31.446
She was supposed to be
in this morning for her meds.

31:31.465 --> 31:32.723
Mm-mmm.
She missed Wednesday, too.

31:32.799 --> 31:34.449
I think we need to take
a ride out to the tracks.

31:34.451 --> 31:35.951
SETH:
I'll have Ginger cover
when she gets in.

31:35.969 --> 31:37.969
Okay.

31:38.046 --> 31:39.971
Hey. Um, so, did you
get a chance

31:40.124 --> 31:41.123
to look at the divorce papers?

31:41.125 --> 31:43.275
I did, and I think
it's a mistake.

31:44.645 --> 31:48.146
Look, Iris, I know life's
been super hard for you,

31:48.298 --> 31:51.074
but you've been handling it
very bravely.

31:51.151 --> 31:54.077
And this is not a mistake.

31:54.229 --> 31:55.971
We are definitely
not a mistake.

31:55.989 --> 31:57.581
This man is literally my heart.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.991
I-I think you mean figuratively.

32:00.144 --> 32:01.826
He can't literally
be your heart.

32:01.903 --> 32:03.311
Unless you needed a transplant

32:03.313 --> 32:05.088
and he was in some
sort of horrible accident

32:05.240 --> 32:06.815
and was, like, brain dead.

32:06.833 --> 32:08.926
But then you'd have
to be a match.

32:09.077 --> 32:10.427
You think you're a match?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.746
In every way that matters.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.173
If you say so.

32:15.325 --> 32:16.767
I still think
it would be a mistake for me

32:16.918 --> 32:18.393
to sign the divorce papers.

32:19.863 --> 32:21.179
Look, Iris.

32:21.256 --> 32:24.015
Carlos loves you, okay?
And he cares for you.

32:24.092 --> 32:26.168
But he cannot
stay married to you.

32:26.170 --> 32:29.112
First of all,
he's gay and he's mine.

32:30.507 --> 32:31.597
Oh, I know.

32:31.617 --> 32:35.101
So then why won't you
sign the divorce papers?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.453
Because if I file for divorce,

32:36.604 --> 32:38.271
it would be saying that
we were married and we weren't.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.439
I mean, not really.

32:39.533 --> 32:41.366
It would be a mistake
to say that we were.

32:41.443 --> 32:45.353
Besides, you shouldn't be
Carlos' second marriage.

32:45.355 --> 32:48.006
You should be
his first and his last.

32:48.950 --> 32:49.949
What are you saying?

32:49.969 --> 32:51.526
I thought that was obvious.

32:51.528 --> 32:53.453
No, not really.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.121
I'm saying I don't think
we should get a divorce.

32:55.199 --> 32:57.365
I think we should
get an annulment.

32:57.384 --> 33:00.435
Our marriage wasn't real,
but yours will be.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.042
Thank you.

33:07.135 --> 33:09.544
Just please don't sit me
next to a Gemini at the wedding.

33:09.563 --> 33:10.729
They make me jumpy.

33:10.881 --> 33:11.971
No Geminis.

33:12.049 --> 33:13.565
Okay.

33:13.641 --> 33:15.659
Um, hey, one more thing.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.497
When you said I was exactly
what you expected,

33:20.574 --> 33:23.225
just curious,
what, what'd you mean by that?

33:23.227 --> 33:25.585
Oh, that you're a hot mess.

33:26.897 --> 33:28.230
I'm-- I'm a hot mess?

33:28.248 --> 33:30.656
Yeah. The bird with
a broken wing, a fixer-upper.

33:30.676 --> 33:34.160
Carlos always needs a project.
More tragic, the better.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.404
Hell, look at me.

33:36.406 --> 33:39.349
Is that what you think I am
to Carlos, just a project?

33:39.501 --> 33:42.761
No, no, no. I think you're
so much more than that, TK.

33:42.913 --> 33:45.188
I think you could be
his life's work.

33:46.433 --> 33:47.691
No Geminis.

33:59.854 --> 34:01.930
-Reverend Parks.
-Hey.

34:01.948 --> 34:03.765
Peonies, my favorite.

34:03.784 --> 34:06.859
My grandmama had a yard
full of 'em back in Topeka.

34:06.937 --> 34:08.378
They always feel like home.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.955
Well, thank you. Come on in.
Dinner's almost ready.

34:11.108 --> 34:13.124
I hope communion wine is okay.

34:13.277 --> 34:14.442
Uh, I didn't have enough time

34:14.444 --> 34:16.053
to hit up
the liquor store, so...

34:16.613 --> 34:17.612
I'm kidding.

34:17.872 --> 34:20.057
All we have back at the church
is grape juice.

34:20.133 --> 34:22.059
It's Bordeaux.
It needs to breathe.

34:22.135 --> 34:23.602
-Bordeaux's perfect.
-Uh-huh.

34:25.472 --> 34:26.821
You know, driving over here,

34:26.957 --> 34:29.974
I thought I should have
insisted on taking you out.

34:30.127 --> 34:32.143
Save you the trouble
of cooking for us,

34:32.296 --> 34:36.573
but, uh, I have to admit,
it smells so good.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.700
I'm glad I wasn't a--

34:39.894 --> 34:41.469
a fool.

34:41.488 --> 34:45.231
Well, my late husband
was an amazing chef,

34:45.250 --> 34:47.584
and he taught me
a few things along the way.

34:48.829 --> 34:49.994
-Hey, hey.
-TOMMY: Hey.

34:50.071 --> 34:52.089
-TOMMY: Hi Mommy.
-JUDD RYDER: Hi.

34:52.240 --> 34:53.072
Guess who just
took a big old doo-doo

34:53.150 --> 34:54.574
before we left the house?

34:54.668 --> 34:57.094
And girl, I brought the salad
but I left the dressing again.

34:57.170 --> 34:58.512
-I'm sorry.
-That's fine.

34:59.323 --> 35:00.246
-Reverend Parks.
-Oh.

35:00.324 --> 35:01.247
TOMMY:
Hey, baby.

35:01.325 --> 35:03.541
How about that? Howdy.

35:03.693 --> 35:04.768
Yeah, how about that?

35:04.919 --> 35:06.252
(laughter)

35:06.271 --> 35:08.254
We weren't expecting
to see you here tonight.

35:08.332 --> 35:10.165
Al-also, it was
our daughter Charlie

35:10.167 --> 35:11.166
that did the doo-doo.

35:11.184 --> 35:12.692
TREVOR:
Right. Right.

35:13.261 --> 35:14.018
Yay.

35:14.171 --> 35:15.946
Who's my goddaughter?
You.

35:16.022 --> 35:17.989
Girls, dinner.

35:19.843 --> 35:21.434
TOGETHER:
Hello, Reverend Parks.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.345
TREVOR: Hey. Uh...

35:23.363 --> 35:25.271
-JUDD: Hey, Rev,
just get comfortable.
-Yeah, sit down.

35:25.349 --> 35:27.940
-Sit down wherever you want.
-(coos)

35:28.018 --> 35:30.127
Well, alright. Alright.

35:30.278 --> 35:31.545
-(sighs)
-TOMMY: Well...

35:33.132 --> 35:34.631
Hope everybody's hungry.

35:34.708 --> 35:35.715
JUDD: Ooh.

35:40.881 --> 35:42.097
(Tommy sighs)

35:53.393 --> 35:54.568
(sighs)

35:59.474 --> 36:03.885
You know, Strand, you might be
a hell of a fire captain.

36:03.887 --> 36:05.720
But you're not much of a spy.

36:05.722 --> 36:07.980
You know how easy it was
for me to find that thing?

36:08.074 --> 36:09.866
It's only 'cause
you saw me put it there.

36:10.093 --> 36:12.243
Actually, I didn't.

36:12.396 --> 36:13.728
But I have pulled over enough

36:13.747 --> 36:16.322
pot-addled college students
in this town

36:16.400 --> 36:18.583
to know when
someone's acting guilty.

36:18.735 --> 36:20.177
Care to explain?

36:20.253 --> 36:21.920
No.

36:21.996 --> 36:25.089
I don't really feel like I need
to explain myself to a Nazi.

36:25.166 --> 36:26.683
-A Nazi?
-Oh, come on.

36:26.834 --> 36:29.411
Look at the ruddy complexion,
the piercing blue eyes.

36:29.545 --> 36:31.646
You look like
a piece of fascist art.

36:33.007 --> 36:35.583
To protect and serve,
O'Brien.

36:35.602 --> 36:37.027
That's what we both swore.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.529
And you're a disgrace.

36:39.606 --> 36:41.364
Who do you work for, Owen?

36:42.108 --> 36:44.850
ATF? FBI?

36:44.870 --> 36:46.036
Get out of my house.

36:46.263 --> 36:47.370
You know, you're lucky
it was me who found that

36:47.447 --> 36:48.371
and not somebody else.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.765
Oh, and, you know,
Red does have

36:50.784 --> 36:52.358
security cameras in the office.

36:52.436 --> 36:54.085
Yeah, I took care
of that for you.

36:55.530 --> 36:57.288
And now I have to figure out
how to take care of you.

36:57.441 --> 36:59.107
What's that supposed to mean?

36:59.125 --> 37:02.052
Grab a helmet.
We're going for a ride.

37:11.955 --> 37:13.288
CARLOS:<i> Babe?</i>

37:13.290 --> 37:14.397
I don't really feel like
cooking tonight.

37:14.624 --> 37:15.957
Do you wanna order in?

37:15.959 --> 37:17.108
That's fine.

37:17.885 --> 37:19.385
CARLOS: Any ideas?

37:19.479 --> 37:20.695
Mexican? Thai?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.314
I don't care, you pick.

37:23.467 --> 37:25.558
CARLOS:
Come on, dude.
I always pick.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.969
Yeah, you do always pick.
You like to pick.

37:27.988 --> 37:29.988
CARLOS:
I do. I do like to pick.

37:30.140 --> 37:31.998
So why don't you
surprise me tonight?

37:40.425 --> 37:43.093
Maybe this marriage
is a bad idea.

37:46.156 --> 37:48.056
Okay, that surprised me.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.724
(TK sighs)

37:55.774 --> 37:57.649
Hey, what's going on?

38:09.288 --> 38:11.771
Do you see me as a project?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.031
A project?

38:13.183 --> 38:14.516
Like something
that needs fixing,

38:14.518 --> 38:16.776
like a bird with a broken wing

38:16.870 --> 38:19.704
or a tragic case
in need of rescuing?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.047
No.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.091
What are you talking about?

38:24.285 --> 38:26.052
When you married Iris...

38:27.288 --> 38:29.047
did you feel like
you can fix her

38:29.199 --> 38:32.124
or save her from her illness?

38:32.202 --> 38:34.869
First off, when I married Iris,

38:34.871 --> 38:37.205
she wasn't showing
any signs of schizophrenia.

38:37.298 --> 38:39.390
And I already told you, TK,

38:39.467 --> 38:43.028
when I married Iris,
<i> I </i> was a project.

38:45.215 --> 38:46.698
I was trying to fix myself.

38:48.309 --> 38:50.118
But I was trying
to fix something...

38:51.221 --> 38:53.221
that wasn't actually broken.

38:53.223 --> 38:55.332
And when did you
figure that out?

38:56.335 --> 38:57.459
Probably...

38:58.228 --> 39:00.912
(inhales and exhales)

39:01.064 --> 39:02.589
...the day I met you.

39:03.083 --> 39:04.156
Shut up.

39:04.234 --> 39:05.508
(Carlos chuckles)

39:09.514 --> 39:11.197
So you don't think
I'm a hot mess?

39:11.199 --> 39:14.075
Oh, no, You're a--
You're a hot mess.

39:14.094 --> 39:16.269
But you're<i> my</i> hot mess.

39:17.004 --> 39:18.913
-I hate you.
-Yeah?

39:18.932 --> 39:21.441
(cell phone buzzing)

39:26.681 --> 39:27.655
Hello?

39:31.428 --> 39:33.495
Yeah. This is Officer Reyes.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.931
More coffee, Reverend?

39:36.950 --> 39:38.282
(sighs)

39:38.435 --> 39:40.210
No, thank you.
It's getting late.

39:40.286 --> 39:43.362
And I should relieve
Deacon and Mrs. Wallace

39:43.440 --> 39:45.106
from their babysitting duties.

39:45.108 --> 39:46.365
TOMMY: Hmm.

39:46.443 --> 39:49.127
That was a glorious meal,
Sister Vega.

39:49.279 --> 39:51.346
Thank you for a lovely evening.

39:52.465 --> 39:54.799
And I'll see y'all
on Sunday, I trust.

39:54.951 --> 39:58.061
-GRACE: You will.
-Unless you've already had
enough of me for one week.

39:58.212 --> 39:59.637
Yeah, we'll be there Sunday.

39:59.789 --> 40:02.732
Um, and, Rev,
those-those short sermons...

40:02.884 --> 40:05.476
-(smacks lips) Ooh. Ooh.
-(Trevor laughs)

40:05.553 --> 40:07.570
I will keep that in mind,
my brother.

40:07.647 --> 40:09.697
-(laughter)
-GRACE: Good to see you,
Reverend.

40:11.301 --> 40:13.159
-He said he'll keep it in mind.
-Stop it.

40:14.304 --> 40:16.663
Um, thank you again.

40:20.310 --> 40:22.502
-Good night.
-Good night, Reverend.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.594
Come over here quickly.

40:32.431 --> 40:33.930
I hope you're proud of yourself.

40:34.081 --> 40:35.748
I know.
I should have told you.

40:35.825 --> 40:36.933
I... (sighs)

40:37.051 --> 40:38.393
GRACE: Yeah.

40:39.162 --> 40:40.478
Told us what?

40:41.440 --> 40:42.680
Judd. (laughs)

40:42.832 --> 40:44.182
My love.

40:44.334 --> 40:47.426
Did you not realize that
we were the third and fourth

40:47.504 --> 40:49.737
and fifth wheels
on a date tonight?

40:51.024 --> 40:52.023
-Oh.
-No?

40:52.099 --> 40:53.524
No. Y'all know that, uh--

40:53.677 --> 40:56.286
-That explains the cologne.
-Hmm.

40:56.362 --> 40:57.120
Huh.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.121
GRACE:
So, what happened?

40:58.272 --> 40:59.697
Because you were
supposed to tell him

40:59.849 --> 41:00.940
that you weren't interested.

41:01.017 --> 41:03.367
Yes, I know, and I had
planned to, okay?

41:03.444 --> 41:06.370
And then he asked me out,
and my brain said one thing,

41:06.447 --> 41:08.298
but then my lips and my body

41:08.374 --> 41:11.209
just decided to
play on another team.

41:11.285 --> 41:13.528
If this was your idea
of a first date,

41:13.546 --> 41:15.213
I'm pretty sure
he got the message.

41:15.365 --> 41:16.973
Oh, my. I feel terrible.

41:17.124 --> 41:19.458
-As you should, friend.
-TOMMY: Ugh.

41:19.536 --> 41:20.459
The worst part is,

41:20.479 --> 41:24.055
that he's--
Lord, he's so charming.

41:24.207 --> 41:25.373
And you were right.

41:25.391 --> 41:27.984
Yes, Grace, you're right.

41:28.061 --> 41:29.210
I think I like him.

41:29.229 --> 41:30.469
GRACE: Tommy,
I don't even wanna hear it

41:30.489 --> 41:33.138
because the man is
probably already on his way

41:33.216 --> 41:34.741
back to Kansas now.

41:35.735 --> 41:37.368
(knock on door)

41:39.055 --> 41:41.055
Did he forget something?

41:41.074 --> 41:42.582
He probably wants
his flowers back.

41:45.562 --> 41:47.420
(indistinct chatter)

41:48.915 --> 41:50.131
Reverend.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.725
Next time, let's ditch
the chaperones.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.061
TOMMY: Uh-huh.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.731
Y'all have a good night.

42:13.532 --> 42:17.158
Well, I think
you still got a shot.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.410
(clears throat)

42:20.430 --> 42:22.038
(siren wails)

42:27.045 --> 42:28.545
APD DETECTIVE:
Officer Reyes.

42:29.196 --> 42:30.505
Come with me.

42:33.218 --> 42:36.127
Patrol unit spotted the car
about an hour ago.

42:36.203 --> 42:37.512
You recognize it?

42:38.798 --> 42:40.056
CARLOS: No.

42:40.133 --> 42:42.374
It's registered
to a Iris Blake.

42:42.394 --> 42:45.019
I called you because
we found this on the seat.

42:46.790 --> 42:47.730
Divorce papers.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.483
Your name's on them.

42:56.983 --> 43:01.135
Any idea why your wife might
have been out here, officer?

43:01.154 --> 43:02.662
She works with the homeless.

43:10.571 --> 43:12.672
In fact,
she used to be one of 'em.
