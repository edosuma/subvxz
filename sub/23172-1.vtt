<i>Based on actual events.
USSR, June 1985.</i>

01:12.100 --> 01:16.521
It's uncommon to see welding and
not to hear its sound. I love her sound.

01:16.938 --> 01:18.439
Shykhshyhshyh?

01:20.232 --> 01:22.484
You're good at it.

01:23.819 --> 01:25.654
Excellent welded.

01:28.615 --> 01:34.037
Only melted pieces remain on
metal. You see, they come to the opposite side.

01:34.829 --> 01:36.206
I see.

01:36.581 --> 01:41.210
There is not much film left. Light, smile.
A pair of historical frames.

01:43.546 --> 01:45.255
You look great.

01:53.764 --> 01:58.644
Guys, let's round off already.
You are 4 hours 10 minutes in open space.

01:58.936 --> 02:02.439
- And what about the Earth?
- We will enter the zone in a couple of minutes.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.733
We begin to gather slowly.

02:06.610 --> 02:07.861
That's interesting,

02:08.152 --> 02:13.491
if one day one has to leave
Earth, can he live in space?

02:14.033 --> 02:20.706
Continue your family, raise children,
find a livelihood, fall in love?

02:21.248 --> 02:24.084
Make love in outer space.

02:24.376 --> 02:28.171
Probably, someday and such
the experiment will be conducted by mankind.

02:30.257 --> 02:36.679
Invent some kind of simulator for
preparing cosmonauts for ... love

02:36.971 --> 02:41.058
"Cosmonaut Ivanov held a record
amount of time in the simulator Â»

02:41.475 --> 02:46.939
- Yes, there will be a new space record.
- Enough is enough.

02:49.066 --> 02:51.651
So, fellow cosmonauts,
what kind of simulators are there?

02:51.860 --> 02:55.864
By the way, you weld
in outer space.

02:56.281 --> 02:59.284
Dawn, we're done. Going back.

02:59.701 --> 03:03.121
So go back to the station.
What about oxygen?

03:03.329 --> 03:05.290
There are 15 more minutes.

03:05.707 --> 03:08.710
I thought we were out of communication.
It was awkward.

03:08.918 --> 03:14.382
I thought so too, but I decided to give
possibility of cosmonaut Lazareva

03:14.590 --> 03:18.344
personally present the project
for management's consideration.

03:18.636 --> 03:22.598
The idea was accepted for consideration,
Next year we will start preparing.

03:23.390 --> 03:28.644
Comrades, a woman for the first time in open space
- and she jokes, laughs, speaks of love!

03:28.895 --> 03:31.355
I would applaud the cosmonaut Lazareva.

03:32.023 --> 03:34.275
In the MCC, by the way, she is already applauding.

03:34.734 --> 03:37.695
- Ay!
- What's the matter?

03:40.614 --> 03:42.199
Light, freeze! Do not move!

03:43.033 --> 03:46.537
- What happened?
- I pierced the glove.

03:50.249 --> 03:52.626
- Hold your hand, do not move.
- I am doing my best.

03:53.126 --> 03:57.838
Burr from welding through the glove
pierced. And sticks on both sides.

03:58.130 --> 04:00.883
"What's the pressure?"
- It's falling.

04:01.217 --> 04:02.509
You, the main thing, do not twitch.

04:02.843 --> 04:06.847
"Volodya, can you cut the metal neatly?"
"It's already being done."

04:14.230 --> 04:17.567
"How's the pressure?"
- 0.7 atmospheres.

04:17.774 --> 04:21.319
Normal pressure. Hand come on.

04:22.404 --> 04:27.909
And let's go quietly,
as for a walk. As in the Arbat.

04:28.701 --> 04:32.747
That's right, past the house of the book.
Opposite the restaurant is Prague.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.959
We turn to the boulevard.
Light, talk to me

04:37.210 --> 04:38.336
I'm talking with you...

04:38.586 --> 04:42.465
"Volodya, you do not have more than two minutes for everything."
- It's OK, we'll be in time.

04:43.215 --> 04:46.468
Well, recall how silver
according to Mendeleyev's table?

04:47.218 --> 04:49.846
- What?
- Silver on the table ...

04:51.014 --> 04:53.016
- Argentum.
"And mercury?"

04:53.474 --> 04:57.645
- Hydrargyrum.
- Right! I always confuse them with each other.

05:00.189 --> 05:03.025
- Guys, I do not see you. Where are you?
- Getting close.

05:03.276 --> 05:05.528
We are going to the cinema?

05:06.987 --> 05:08.489
Oh sure.

05:09.657 --> 05:14.285
There are very few left.
We can go to the "Autumn Marathon".

05:15.244 --> 05:18.247
"Are you coming in?"
- Yes, we are.

05:22.251 --> 05:26.590
- Do you like the Autumn Marathon?
- I Love ... "Autumn Marathon" ...

05:26.965 --> 05:30.260
Hold on, Light ... Hold on, dear ...

05:31.636 --> 05:33.555
That's all.

05:36.349 --> 05:37.891
How's the pressure?

05:39.268 --> 05:40.894
Are you coming in?

05:42.479 --> 05:46.983
Lazarev! Fedorov!
Are you online? Reception!

05:47.818 --> 05:51.821
Guys, are you inside or not yet?
What's happening?!

06:11.256 --> 06:14.551
It's hard for me to explain this
from the point of view of the laws of physics.

06:19.764 --> 06:24.769
Vladimir Petrovich, you yourself
think how it looks from the outside.

06:27.396 --> 06:28.939
Astronaut Lazarev almost died

06:29.105 --> 06:32.609
from the fact that you saw the light,
and he eclipsed your consciousness.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.777
If I write so in the report,

06:34.903 --> 06:38.281
It will greatly affect your future
in the space detachment.

06:40.743 --> 06:42.870
Maybe they were angels?

06:44.496 --> 06:46.039
How do you like this answer?

06:49.918 --> 06:51.503
Are you joking?

06:53.296 --> 06:55.881
If I were joking, you would laugh.

07:51.224 --> 07:56.063
When you flew by the Soviet Union,
Have you thought about Olya and me?

07:56.439 --> 07:57.606
Uh-huh.

07:58.274 --> 07:59.775
Everytime?

08:00.568 --> 08:01.944
Everytime.

08:02.611 --> 08:04.905
What, 16 times a day?

08:06.407 --> 08:08.325
Even more.

08:09.368 --> 08:13.204
I did not think about you only,
when flying over Madagascar.

08:15.414 --> 08:18.417
And what were you thinking about Madagascar?

08:22.213 --> 08:27.217
I thought it would be if I was from outer space
I'll land in Madagascar.

08:28.719 --> 08:34.182
Probably, the local Papuans will see,
as I fall, find me

08:35.808 --> 08:38.477
and make the leader of his tribe.

08:39.727 --> 08:46.193
And I'll tell them about space,
about the stars, about the universe ...

08:49.613 --> 08:53.575
... and a little about what
I had a life in the USSR.

08:55.410 --> 08:59.581
And what was your life like in the USSR?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.209
Well, tell me.

09:33.237 --> 09:34.739
I love you.

09:37.325 --> 09:40.411
I want you back.
to life on Earth.

09:44.457 --> 09:46.000
I'm trying to.

09:55.466 --> 10:01.514
- How is it?
- Volodya, here is the Earth. Here, objects fall down.

10:02.181 --> 10:06.894
- Let's go to.
- Wait, it's awkward ...

10:45.181 --> 10:47.307
Something at me the signal was gone.

10:49.184 --> 10:51.061
Renouncement!

10:51.853 --> 10:54.773
The telemetry system does not work!

10:55.273 --> 10:58.276
- The temperature sensors cut down!
- And radio electronics too!

10:58.526 --> 10:59.986
The battery packs do not respond.

11:00.236 --> 11:04.866
I see, I see, the failure of all systems. Calmly,
without panic! Reboot the system.

11:15.583 --> 11:18.336
"What could have happened to it?"
"The signal is gone."

11:18.670 --> 11:21.214
"How much communication is there?"
- Three hours and almost six minutes.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.132
Come with me. All with me!

11:23.299 --> 11:26.135
Valera, photos from telescopes on Gagarin.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.890
I can not see a damn thing. Either she, or not she.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.436
- Maybe her Americans were shot down?
- Yeah, hell they're going to hit her ...

11:34.603 --> 11:37.147
And if this is their SDI, if
"Star wars" launched?

11:38.023 --> 11:39.398
You call the Ministry of Defense?

11:39.565 --> 11:44.111
No, I want to cancel shish kebabs for tomorrow. So,
connect me with the Ministry of Defense!

11:52.285 --> 11:56.164
The Russians completely lost control
over its orbital space station.

11:56.373 --> 12:01.378
Salyut-7 turned into an unmanageable
a space object weighing 20 tons.

12:01.586 --> 12:07.382
While no one can determine how long Soviet
The station will stay in orbit in this mode.

12:07.758 --> 12:12.471
According to experts in the near future
the station will begin to fall precipitously.

12:12.762 --> 12:17.851
When and where is the Soviet space
will the station drop to Earth?

12:18.101 --> 12:21.813
There is a high probability that she
can fall on the United States,

12:25.024 --> 12:29.779
The fall of the station to the locality
will lead to numerous victims.

12:30.070 --> 12:33.240
When falling to the ground, the station
can destroy a whole region.

12:33.490 --> 12:36.826
We hope that the Russians themselves
will be able to solve their problems,

12:36.951 --> 12:39.412
but we, too, will not waste time in vain,
we will develop our action plan ...

12:40.121 --> 12:44.627
Comrade Shubin, how could this happen,
that in the midst of the Cold War,

12:44.835 --> 12:48.255
we, suddenly, lose the most important
a strategic object in space?

12:48.630 --> 12:51.925
We, unfortunately, do not know yet,
what happened, we try to understand.

12:52.176 --> 12:56.304
If you do not know what happened, respectively,
you do not know what to do. This is true?

12:56.637 --> 12:59.640
We know what to do. You need to fly
to the station, and there already to understand.

12:59.932 --> 13:02.059
Well, when will you fly?

13:02.518 --> 13:05.813
The station will be in orbit for another three months.
We will prepare.

13:06.105 --> 13:09.149
"We do not have time for this."
- And what's the rush?

13:09.316 --> 13:10.776
We received information,

13:10.901 --> 13:14.696
that NASA has designated a start
Challenger for 30 number.

13:14.905 --> 13:17.282
That is, after 22 days.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.493
Take a look.

13:20.660 --> 13:26.331
This is our station Salyut-7.
Weight 20 tons. The size is 15 by 6 meters.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.959
And this is the American shuttle "Challenger".

13:29.126 --> 13:33.338
The size of the cargo area is 15 by 6 meters.
The capacity is 20 tons.

13:33.588 --> 13:35.674
Funny coincidence, is not it?

13:36.758 --> 13:39.386
And here's another funny coincidence.

13:40.679 --> 13:45.684
This is the new member of the Challenger crew.
Our Frenchman Patrick De Bonel.

13:45.850 --> 13:48.101
I flew with Fedorov to Salyut-7.

13:48.393 --> 13:53.398
Still friends with him, and even parcels
he sends it. With chestnuts and smelly cheese.

13:54.066 --> 13:59.197
Patrick knows Salyut-7 as well
as our guys.

13:59.447 --> 14:05.911
And if the Americans seize our
station, is that what will be, the invasion?

14:06.245 --> 14:09.123
Not just an invasion.
We will have to answer.

14:09.456 --> 14:15.711
Valery Petrovich, you understand that we can not
allow the Americans to land at our station.

14:16.254 --> 14:20.550
If you are not ready to fly, we
will be forced to knock it down with a rocket.

14:21.968 --> 14:28.432
If you destroy it, then the fragments from this explosion will lead to
All satellites that are in orbit are out of order.

14:28.641 --> 14:31.393
We will lose space. Well, 10 years at least.

14:32.436 --> 14:35.898
We can not destroy the cosmos.

14:36.273 --> 14:40.359
Valery Petrovich, prepare the crew.

14:49.952 --> 14:52.454
Today marks fifteen years

14:52.579 --> 14:56.708
Since the moment of entering the first orbit
space station "Salyut".

14:57.334 --> 15:02.923
Now a new modification of this station -
"Salyut-7" successfully works in near-earth orbit.

15:03.090 --> 15:07.177
Her flight is on schedule
program in automatic mode

15:07.511 --> 15:09.512
without the crew of astronauts.

15:09.888 --> 15:15.643
The whole system is monitored
from the Earth Center for Flight Control.

15:18.229 --> 15:21.858
The station rotates on two axes.
Approximately 1 degree per second

15:22.275 --> 15:26.863
- How can you dock with her then?
- Fedorov would have docked

15:27.488 --> 15:31.199
Manually docked only
Lazovoy, Fedorov, and Plakhov.

15:32.033 --> 15:33.910
Astakhov has many hours of training.

15:34.202 --> 15:37.580
But why guess? It is necessary to plant
guys on the simulator,

15:37.830 --> 15:41.167
and work out the docking
with a rotating station.

15:41.376 --> 15:42.877
Yes, we must try.

15:43.669 --> 15:45.755
We call Valer, Fedorov?

15:46.088 --> 15:49.258
For Fedorov, the space is closed by doctors.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.135
We try the rest.

15:53.179 --> 15:57.640
- Something does not bite.
- Maybe the fish had a hibernation?

16:03.104 --> 16:07.358
We must start warming up. And then I have
now, too, winter hibernation will begin.

16:07.525 --> 16:08.818
It's with pleasure.

16:21.664 --> 16:24.458
Victor Petrovich! Comrade Alyokhin!

16:24.917 --> 16:28.086
We are looking for you everywhere, you
urgently call in the detachment.

16:29.338 --> 16:30.505
Now!

16:32.132 --> 16:36.928
"Well, we must get ready."
"Why do you need them so urgently?"

16:37.512 --> 16:39.514
The medical commission must have passed.

16:40.140 --> 16:42.267
Volod, pick up the fishing rod, please.

16:44.060 --> 16:46.312
And what about the medical board did not say?

16:46.729 --> 16:48.313
So what can I say?

16:48.605 --> 16:53.193
How many times have I been dragged to this
medical board, and then in duplicates.

16:53.693 --> 16:58.990
- Thought I would be upset that they did not call me?
- To be honest, that too.

17:00.158 --> 17:01.868
You ohrenel, Vyt?

17:02.368 --> 17:05.622
You decided that I would be upset,
that you are called, but I do not?

17:06.664 --> 17:08.665
Decided to pity me?

17:10.334 --> 17:15.046
And you know, you're not an astronaut at all,
you were not even in outer space.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.049
You're an engineer in a spacesuit.

17:35.317 --> 17:36.568
Be healthy.

17:46.493 --> 17:48.203
- Hello, Vit.
- Kind.

17:48.579 --> 17:54.251
- Listen, and what is your wife's time then?
"Thirty-one weeks and three days."

17:57.337 --> 17:59.047
- Four days.
- Four...

17:59.506 --> 18:00.757
Four days, yes.

18:01.925 --> 18:05.387
"So this is about to begin, is not it?"
- Yes.

18:06.220 --> 18:11.266
Wow, we've transferred you from backups
in the main crew.

18:11.934 --> 18:13.018
Thank you.

18:14.728 --> 18:17.105
We want you to fly to the Salute.

18:21.943 --> 18:24.404
- So I'm ready.
"Only this is not a planned flight."

18:24.779 --> 18:26.573
- What happened?
- It happened, Vitya.

18:26.781 --> 18:30.410
We lost contact with the station.
We do not understand what happened to her.

18:30.535 --> 18:33.328
You did it with your own hands,
so you know her better than anyone else.

18:33.537 --> 18:37.541
"And who is the commander?"
- And who would you like to fly with?

18:40.001 --> 18:41.461
With Fedorov.

18:44.214 --> 18:49.803
Do not make sudden movements. Repeat the trajectory
movement of the docking unit. Well and further on sensations.

18:50.054 --> 18:53.057
Wahler, come on like this. Docking -
with you a bottle of cognac.

18:53.265 --> 18:56.268
- Dock - from me a box.
- Have agreed.

19:10.281 --> 19:11.740
We stick together ...

19:14.451 --> 19:15.369
Yes b ...

19:15.661 --> 19:19.581
"Gene, try not so fast."
- Go.

19:35.345 --> 19:38.265
We modeled the visual
micromodel of station rotation.

19:38.515 --> 19:42.644
The ship will have to repeat exactly
the trajectory of the station's rotation and so to dock.

19:43.019 --> 19:47.774
Theoretically, of course, this is possible,
but, I'm afraid, only theoretically.

19:49.566 --> 19:50.734
Come on, come on, come on...

19:55.489 --> 20:01.079
We remove one seat. Instead of him
in addition we load fuel, food, water.

20:01.579 --> 20:06.250
In space, each gram is worth its weight in gold.
Less food, water, less oxygen.

20:06.375 --> 20:09.378
And there will be fewer casualties, if that, yes?

20:16.634 --> 20:18.428
Guys, well, it's impossible.

20:21.514 --> 20:25.142
No, Valery Petrovich, it will not work.

20:25.434 --> 20:28.229
Imagine that you stop by the garage.

20:28.521 --> 20:29.647
Here, it's going to be a car.

20:29.855 --> 20:34.068
And the gate you first so,
then so, so, still so ...

20:58.674 --> 21:01.844
You're more pampered with her, well,
as with a woman!

21:02.261 --> 21:05.847
Valer, I'm with a woman who rotates
on all its axes, have not tried it yet.

21:06.263 --> 21:08.349
I'm not sure that someone will do it.

21:32.414 --> 21:35.208
Well, who is our next commander?

21:35.500 --> 21:37.919
The commanders ended up with me.

21:41.047 --> 21:42.757
The entire detachment was tried.

22:54.700 --> 22:55.867
Hello, Volod!

22:57.244 --> 22:59.246
"Oh, Valer, she's well."
- How are you?

22:59.412 --> 23:03.583
- Nothing, nothing. How are you?
- Yes, it's okay like it.

23:05.126 --> 23:10.048
Heard, we have difficulties
with sending the crew to the "Salute"?

23:10.924 --> 23:14.927
Docking can not? I heard.

23:16.011 --> 23:18.305
Do you think this is even possible?

23:19.431 --> 23:22.017
- Does it rotate strongly?
- Strongly.

23:23.309 --> 23:25.770
More degrees on all axes.

23:27.522 --> 23:30.566
Valera, you're a pilot.
You know everything.

23:46.332 --> 23:51.712
Okay. Glad to see.
I'm going to teach young people.

23:53.464 --> 23:57.593
Volod, if you had to fly?

24:00.637 --> 24:02.389
Everything is complicated there ..

24:08.769 --> 24:10.145
It fits me

24:13.190 --> 24:16.068
Tomorrow morning to the medical board.

24:21.490 --> 24:24.326
I will only replace one light bulb
and immediately back. At once.

24:24.534 --> 24:27.245
And someone else can not
to send a light bulb to change?

24:27.454 --> 24:29.831
I'm the best engineer. You know.

24:30.749 --> 24:34.334
You are deceiving me. The best engineer
Do not just send a light bulb change.

24:34.543 --> 24:37.879
- My little?
- You're hiding something.

24:39.423 --> 24:41.466
That's what I'm hiding from you, what?

24:42.384 --> 24:45.929
That something had happened there.
Something serious.

24:46.054 --> 24:49.600
That all refused to fly,
and only you, the fool, agreed.

24:50.976 --> 24:54.396
So ... Pregnant that you can not do?

24:54.688 --> 24:55.856
You can not be nervous.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.900
- What are you doing?
- I'm nervous.

24:58.108 --> 25:02.695
Stop, please. Oh please.
Well, do not be nervous.

25:15.207 --> 25:18.085
Here, fly, take with you.

25:18.460 --> 25:20.212
- Into the space?
- Yes.

25:20.504 --> 25:24.049
- Honey, well, we do not go skiing on skis.
- So, without talking!

25:26.008 --> 25:27.176
There is.

25:28.010 --> 25:31.013
Two hats! Come here.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.600
Give the menu, please.

25:39.730 --> 25:44.985
- They say that Gorbachev introduces a dry law.
- Yes I know. I'm a little bit.

25:51.448 --> 25:52.908
For what we drink?

25:53.492 --> 25:55.953
I'm flying tomorrow to Baikonur with Vitya.

25:56.537 --> 25:57.996
Are you kidding?

25:58.539 --> 26:02.710
- In a week into space.
- You're written off.

26:03.711 --> 26:05.505
It happened.

26:07.465 --> 26:11.594
They can not cope without me.
You need to manually join.

26:14.138 --> 26:17.474
Everything will be fine. Do not worry.

26:17.849 --> 26:19.559
Come on, you know where!

26:23.146 --> 26:24.230
Nin ...

26:28.776 --> 26:32.363
Tell me what's wrong with you
this cursed cosmos,

26:32.488 --> 26:35.741
on what did you exchange us with Olya?

26:47.794 --> 26:53.758
I confirm the readiness of the spacecraft to launch.
The spacecraft is switched to onboard food. Seventh.

26:53.966 --> 26:55.968
The report of the seventh was adopted, the first

26:56.260 --> 26:59.096
First, there is a farm break
lateral blocks, the seventieth

26:59.305 --> 27:01.682
The report of the seventieth was adopted, the first

27:02.474 --> 27:05.477
Start is enabled.
Bleed one.

27:06.603 --> 27:09.063
Purge. Bleeding 2.

27:14.194 --> 27:15.487
The key to drainage.

27:16.279 --> 27:17.614
Inflating.

27:18.115 --> 27:20.242
Earth-board. The mast has departed.

27:20.825 --> 27:22.786
- Start!
- Ignition!

27:23.787 --> 27:25.163
Preliminary.

27:26.581 --> 27:27.957
Intermediate.

27:28.833 --> 27:29.876
The main thing.

27:30.460 --> 27:31.628
Climb!

27:48.518 --> 27:51.813
Good goes, beautiful!

28:02.947 --> 28:04.324
How are the fluctuations?

28:04.741 --> 28:07.994
The oscillations persist.
The car goes rigidly, but surely.

28:08.244 --> 28:10.830
Tangazh, yaw, rotation - normal.

28:11.748 --> 28:14.917
Management System Parameters
the launch vehicle is normal.

28:15.251 --> 28:17.295
There is a reset of the DAS CAC.

28:17.837 --> 28:19.922
There is a department of the first stage.

28:20.339 --> 28:22.675
There is switching off the engine of the side blocks.

28:22.967 --> 28:25.094
There is a deactivation of the side blocks.

28:25.343 --> 28:27.263
Stabilization of the product is stable.

28:27.847 --> 28:32.309
Pamirs, and what is that you have there dangling?

28:34.561 --> 28:38.023
It's an Olympic bear, Dawn.
My daughter gave me.

28:39.149 --> 28:42.652
- Talisman?
- Indicator of weightlessness.

28:45.071 --> 28:46.490
For good luck!

28:48.533 --> 28:50.327
There is a branch of the head fairing.

28:50.535 --> 28:52.077
There is a department of the main stage.

28:52.286 --> 28:54.413
There is a shutdown of the main engine.

28:56.081 --> 28:58.166
There is a tail drop.

29:11.221 --> 29:15.016
Well, guys, you're in orbit! Congratulations!

29:16.017 --> 29:17.934
Congratulations, Dawn!

30:00.100 --> 30:05.272
Today at seven in the morning Moscow time, came out
into orbit the Soyuz-T-13 spacecraft.

30:05.606 --> 30:07.691
Daddy flew into the sky.

30:07.983 --> 30:12.111
The crew of the ship is to be carried out
docking with the orbital complex Salyut-7,

30:12.403 --> 30:14.905
carry out planned studies
and experiments

30:15.114 --> 30:18.033
for the benefit of the world and all Soviet people.

30:18.826 --> 30:21.370
In the Khabarovsk kravo
Komsomol organization ...

30:38.802 --> 30:42.723
- I do not see her yet.
"She's still in the shadows."

30:43.390 --> 30:48.979
Soon it should appear in about 90 degrees
right on the pitch and somewhere around 10 degrees in the yaw.

30:49.813 --> 30:50.940
We wait.

30:52.692 --> 30:53.734
Not yet ...

30:56.028 --> 30:58.823
There she is. I can see it.

30:59.198 --> 31:02.784
Well, turn the ship around.
Let us take a look.

31:03.701 --> 31:05.119
I'm taking aim.

31:13.002 --> 31:14.837
Here it is, dear.

31:15.921 --> 31:19.383
And we see.
Let's go quietly.

31:26.931 --> 31:30.977
1600 meters. Approximately through
5 minutes we will be at the station.

31:31.227 --> 31:35.147
Fly at a distance
Two hundred meters and there hang.

31:36.565 --> 31:37.566
There is.

31:54.749 --> 31:58.502
- Can we start to extinguish the speed?
"It's early yet."

32:12.350 --> 32:17.063
Gashu the lateral speed.
I give 2 meters per second for braking.

32:20.065 --> 32:21.983
Dawn, you see her?

32:25.737 --> 32:26.613
We see.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.699
Rotation by pitch approx.
1.5 degrees per second.

32:29.908 --> 32:31.909
This is even faster than we expected.

32:32.160 --> 32:37.331
Dawn, pay attention, solar panels
deployed in different directions.

32:37.874 --> 32:40.459
Yes, we see.

32:41.294 --> 32:43.711
- Stepanovich?
- It's not clear yet.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.213
Sash?

32:45.964 --> 32:49.634
"We'll have to take pictures." Then we will analyze.
- We do.

32:49.884 --> 32:55.723
Pamirs, with fuel more poetic.
There are no more than three attempts to join.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.266
I understand you, Dawn.

32:57.642 --> 33:02.271
- Still back on something you need to return.
- Yes. Well, with God?

33:04.106 --> 33:06.817
So, Pamirs, start docking!

33:08.611 --> 33:09.944
Go.

33:43.268 --> 33:47.856
"We're going to the mooring."
- I put forward the docking rod of the docking mechanism.

33:51.818 --> 33:54.195
The distance to the site is 32 meters.

34:07.624 --> 34:09.333
We go to the dock.

34:30.438 --> 34:32.148
Lead, crash!

35:02.134 --> 35:03.302
No docking.

35:04.052 --> 35:07.097
- Lead, lead!
- I see, I'm taking them away, I'm taking them away! Calm down!

35:13.770 --> 35:18.690
- Strongly collided?
- Not much. We almost braked.

35:19.024 --> 35:22.402
So, Pamirs, you are now
go into the radioten,

35:22.778 --> 35:27.074
rest better.
And we'll confer here, we'll think about it.

35:28.742 --> 35:30.035
Until the connection.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.746
"I understand you."
- There is.

35:33.163 --> 35:36.624
We'll take a look at it externally.

35:39.127 --> 35:44.549
So. If you start moving from 11 meters
at a speed of 35 centimeters per second,

35:44.841 --> 35:46.926
it will be exactly a quarter of a turn.

35:47.176 --> 35:50.179
And, in principle, we will be able to catch the knot.

36:03.484 --> 36:05.736
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying.

36:06.111 --> 36:09.656
I select the speed. You suggested it yourself.

36:10.239 --> 36:14.076
- You can not go without a team.
- Nothing. We will rehearse a little.

36:15.327 --> 36:17.371
Did you hear what the earth said?

36:17.955 --> 36:21.292
"Let's do an external inspection of the station."
- I understood.

36:32.344 --> 36:35.389
By longitudinal station
rotates in one plane.

36:35.721 --> 36:39.808
Estimated docking speed
15 centimeters per second.

36:40.142 --> 36:45.314
This is not enough for the ship
adjust to the station and catch its rotation.

36:48.358 --> 36:50.402
Let's try to catch the movement.

36:51.695 --> 36:53.572
Let's take a closer look, as they say.

36:54.782 --> 36:57.410
Recheck the readiness of the docking systems.

36:59.328 --> 37:04.040
This is just a rehearsal.
At the same time we'll take a closer look at the station.

37:05.834 --> 37:10.672
So you do not need to reduce the speed, you need it
increase the opposite. A minimum of 3 times.

37:11.005 --> 37:13.049
At least to 35 centimeters per second.

37:19.263 --> 37:22.516
- Is the system ready?
- The system is ready for docking.

37:23.267 --> 37:24.852
Let's go quietly.

37:47.289 --> 37:51.085
110 meters. The speed is 34 centimeters.

37:59.675 --> 38:01.302
Speed ??35.

38:03.929 --> 38:08.518
At this speed, if not coincide, slow down
just do not have time, and this is a guaranteed collision.

38:08.893 --> 38:12.731
35 ... We'll break the ship.

38:13.314 --> 38:16.359
We must return them, damn it.

38:19.528 --> 38:20.529
It's dangerous, Volodya!

38:20.737 --> 38:24.449
You understand, Vitya, every inch here
important. Literally every centimeter.

38:24.741 --> 38:29.788
A little left-right, up-down, forward-backward,
back and forth ... and not a fig. Do you know what I mean?

38:30.622 --> 38:33.124
"We're taking a risk, Volodya."
- Quietly, quietly, quietly ...

38:34.250 --> 38:36.377
Well, dear, will we kiss?

38:36.794 --> 38:38.796
Gashi. Gassy speed! We'll crack!

38:47.095 --> 38:50.432
There is a docking. There is a mehzahvat.

38:50.932 --> 38:53.852
We begin the contraction. Victor!

39:00.942 --> 39:04.278
Now let's calm down.
Why do we have to go around uselessly?

39:04.445 --> 39:06.155
You're crazy crazy!

39:07.990 --> 39:09.283
We docked.

39:09.867 --> 39:12.869
I refuse to continue the flight
together with you, you hear!

39:13.494 --> 39:16.789
Whither, where will you get to?

39:29.469 --> 39:33.265
Valery Petrovich! Valery Petrovich, connection.

39:41.605 --> 39:42.940
Pamirs, reception.

39:43.315 --> 39:45.859
Dawn, I'm Pamir-1. I hear you.

39:46.401 --> 39:49.321
- How are you feeling?
- Excellent.

39:50.906 --> 39:55.327
Pamirs, look. Generally,
we are here to consult ...

39:55.994 --> 39:58.496
Earth, do you already have an image?

39:59.706 --> 40:00.748
Not yet.

40:01.416 --> 40:02.666
We docked.

40:03.709 --> 40:04.960
I mean, did not you understand?

40:05.711 --> 40:10.340
Docking of the Soyuz-T13 and
station Salyut-7 produced successfully.

40:10.632 --> 40:11.967
The contraction is complete.

40:12.217 --> 40:15.220
Reported by the commander of the ship Pamir-1.

40:17.639 --> 40:18.640
Your mother.

40:18.932 --> 40:22.435
Ready to test for leaks
and to the transition to the station.

40:22.644 --> 40:25.021
How do you hear me, Zarya? Reception.

40:27.315 --> 40:28.982
Well, guys, you give!

40:31.651 --> 40:35.906
And we were afraid.
And you need to change your shirt.

40:49.878 --> 40:53.173
Pamirs, I congratulate you, you fellows.

40:53.548 --> 40:56.634
But let's somehow the next time together.

40:56.884 --> 41:00.471
- There is. Accepted.
"So, comrades, we are preparing for the transfer to the station."

41:20.489 --> 41:22.408
We entered the docking station.

41:29.248 --> 41:32.000
Ready to go to the station.
Here is the order.

41:35.504 --> 41:36.546
Open the hatch?

41:36.713 --> 41:39.090
- Valery ...
- Wait a second.

41:41.926 --> 41:44.304
Vitya, you know, like in Georgian, well, wait?

41:45.638 --> 41:47.098
Wait, well!

41:49.350 --> 41:52.645
- Pamirs, reception ...
"Dawn, welcome." The Pamirs are in touch.

41:53.021 --> 41:55.898
Pamir 1 does not enter, Pamir comes in. 2.

41:56.607 --> 41:58.609
Dawn, and what's the matter? Why can not I?

41:58.901 --> 42:03.906
- Can not. The Pamir comes in. 2.
- Guys, give it up. We go in together.

42:04.281 --> 42:06.826
Volod, if something happens to you,

42:07.034 --> 42:10.079
Vitya will not be able to drop the station into the ocean.

42:10.454 --> 42:13.581
This is a necessity,
which we must fulfill.

42:14.749 --> 42:15.917
There is.

42:31.181 --> 42:32.975
Close, Vov.

42:34.351 --> 42:35.352
Come on.

42:46.570 --> 42:50.949
Guys, if, with me, suddenly what will happen,
drown me in the Indian Ocean.

42:51.450 --> 42:54.953
From childhood I dreamed to be there.
Coconuts, bananas ...

42:55.370 --> 42:57.916
"Put off the coconuts!"
- There is.

42:58.374 --> 43:01.419
- Open the pottyhonechku.
- I'm opening it.

43:03.462 --> 43:05.547
Pamir 2, the pressure?

43:06.590 --> 43:07.841
670 mm.

43:11.678 --> 43:13.138
Spits a little.

43:14.389 --> 43:17.433
The pressure drops.
I continue to open.

43:22.522 --> 43:25.566
550 mm. Continues to fall.

43:25.900 --> 43:27.401
- Valera!
- A?

43:28.110 --> 43:31.529
- Critical. It is necessary to close!
- To open? Open it!

43:31.696 --> 43:34.324
- Where to open ?! Close it!
- Vitya ...

43:36.826 --> 43:37.994
- Victor!
- Pamir - 2!

43:40.913 --> 43:45.042
Earth, Earth, I can not hear you.
My ears have been poured from a differential pressure.

43:47.086 --> 43:48.254
Pamir-2?

43:49.797 --> 43:54.343
"Where are you?"
- The Earth, I'm Pamir-2. I'm at the station.

43:56.386 --> 44:00.556
There is no depressurization. But there's ice all around.

44:01.265 --> 44:06.228
In the sense of? What do you mean?
What ice, Vitya?

44:09.231 --> 44:10.901
It is very cold in here.

44:11.610 --> 44:14.613
And what about the instruments? What data?

44:17.949 --> 44:22.744
- On the manometer 530.
"Try the lights on."

44:24.621 --> 44:28.083
Why are you silent? What is there with the light?

44:28.959 --> 44:31.461
Pamir-1, Volodya? Reception

44:31.962 --> 44:34.923
Brothers, yes, there's a knockout.

44:35.423 --> 44:38.593
"Volod, are you at the station?"
- Yes, I'm at the station.

44:40.011 --> 44:43.014
- Well, what is it?
"She's all in the snow."

44:43.431 --> 44:47.100
Do not understand. In what snow?
Are you laughing?

44:47.350 --> 44:51.813
The most ordinary snow.
In places in a centimeter thick.

44:52.063 --> 44:54.441
Guys, but can you see the inside of the panels?

44:57.277 --> 45:02.657
Inside the panels is ice. This is not a station,
but a freezer.

45:02.949 --> 45:05.118
Where did the ice come from?

45:07.078 --> 45:09.080
It looks like "Spring" jerked.

45:10.706 --> 45:12.707
What is the temperature?

45:13.124 --> 45:16.628
Yes, the devil only knows.
The gradient is electronic.

45:16.920 --> 45:18.087
Spit.

45:22.175 --> 45:25.262
"You're cold?"
"It's frozen."

45:25.929 --> 45:28.098
Where did you spit on the porthole?

45:28.515 --> 45:31.059
He spat at me. But I did not.

45:32.686 --> 45:36.732
So, Pamirs, listen to me carefully.
Fly while back on the ship and hang up.

45:37.107 --> 45:39.108
You did not sleep well for a day.

45:40.109 --> 45:41.360
There is.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.950
Well, hello, home.

45:49.826 --> 45:52.704
"Welcome". Did you write?

45:53.830 --> 45:55.540
No, Sveta wrote.

46:09.052 --> 46:11.722
Well, comrades, what thoughts?

46:11.930 --> 46:16.309
- Yes, what thoughts can there be,
"It's not a station anymore, it's just scrap metal."

46:16.643 --> 46:19.562
The guys could have done it ...
but a matter of time.

46:19.729 --> 46:24.651
First they need to warm up the station and melt. And on
this, with the charge of one battery, will take at least 2 days.

46:24.859 --> 46:29.905
"When it melts, everything will be in the water, all the appliances."
"So they will dry it." The question is, how many?

46:30.113 --> 46:33.366
Well, even if they dry, and then
what? All the electronics to touch?

46:33.575 --> 46:37.246
There Alekhine. He this station
I collected my own hands!

46:37.455 --> 46:41.667
- There food for only 10 days.
- It's great that they do not have 10 days?

46:41.792 --> 46:46.505
What 10 days? The station is below zero temperature!
They will not last so long.

46:46.755 --> 46:49.216
They will bask on the ship.
There plus twenty.

46:49.466 --> 46:52.761
Valery Petrovich, oxygen will come from
ship. Hence, the transition hatches will be open.

46:52.845 --> 46:55.721
With such a temperature difference,
the ship will cool very quickly.

46:55.888 --> 46:57.181
They will not last a week.

46:57.473 --> 47:00.142
What Russian peasant will frighten the frost?

47:00.351 --> 47:02.770
"Valery Petrovich, you're Russian."
- Well?

47:03.229 --> 47:06.690
Now if you, the Russian peasant,
lock in your garage in the cold, in the winter

47:06.774 --> 47:10.819
without hot tea and with ice-cold food,
How much will you stretch?

47:12.196 --> 47:14.198
Day? Five?

47:28.043 --> 47:29.753
Pamirs, reception.

47:30.170 --> 47:33.215
Dawn, as you hear me, reception.
Good morning!

47:33.590 --> 47:35.717
We here conferred and understood,
that the most correct decision,

47:35.926 --> 47:41.181
It is to throw the station into the ocean and
to bring you back to Earth.

47:42.307 --> 47:46.394
Dawn, but we are already here. Give us
work at least a couple of days.

47:46.603 --> 47:50.440
Yes, there are a couple of days that is not enough.
Too much risk.

47:56.487 --> 47:59.782
Valera, listen to me,

48:01.159 --> 48:06.038
if you were in our place,
you would just be back home now, right?

48:08.457 --> 48:10.835
- "2 days".
- Valera,

48:14.921 --> 48:16.589
Pamirs, let's do it.

48:18.049 --> 48:19.592
You have five days.

48:20.134 --> 48:24.805
On the sixth, if we do not find a solution,
dump the station into the ocean

48:25.723 --> 48:27.266
and fly home.

48:28.476 --> 48:32.062
There is. Accepted. End of communication.

48:33.564 --> 48:37.776
This week it became known that
Russians are sending a rescue expedition

48:37.985 --> 48:40.153
to his dead station.

48:40.862 --> 48:45.449
"Has the air gone?"
- Come on! Breathes like in the mountains of the Caucasus!

48:45.866 --> 48:51.121
But the American specialists practically
sure that there is no chance to save the station.

48:52.289 --> 48:53.207
Creepy dope ...

48:53.499 --> 48:56.502
This requires a level of technology

48:56.668 --> 49:00.465
still not accessible to mankind.

49:01.090 --> 49:02.175
Natasha, look,

49:03.218 --> 49:06.011
with each turn the temperature
on the ship falls to 0.2 degrees.

49:06.303 --> 49:10.724
So that in all news there is information about
that our cosmonauts are doing well.

49:10.891 --> 49:14.477
Experts believe that the operation
Russian is doomed to failure.

49:14.811 --> 49:15.979
Today everything will be done.

49:16.312 --> 49:19.315
This means that the Soviet
cosmonauts will die.

49:19.691 --> 49:23.987
"But this is unlikely to convince the Americans."
- So, let them speak more convincingly.

49:24.320 --> 49:28.366
Orbit station passes
across the entire territory of the United States.

49:28.699 --> 49:32.327
It is possible that the Russians
the station may have weapons

49:32.619 --> 49:33.912
and, perhaps, even nuclear.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.373
And then the consequences of this
falls can be comparable

49:37.540 --> 49:39.459
with the explosion in Hiroshima.

49:39.709 --> 49:41.377
It might look like this ...

50:00.144 --> 50:04.816
Sergei Mikhailovich, the Americans are preparing
to launch an empty shuttle.

50:05.316 --> 50:08.236
Empty cargo hold. Empty flies.

50:13.742 --> 50:17.037
Dawn, you need a radiator directly
connect to a solar panel,

50:17.287 --> 50:19.247
turn to the sun,

50:19.456 --> 50:23.751
then we get an additional charge
and start heating the station.

50:24.209 --> 50:26.837
The volume of the station is 80 cubic meters.

50:27.087 --> 50:30.799
40 watts per meter in cube
will be 3.2 kilowatts.

50:31.049 --> 50:33.051
We will have a maximum of half.

50:33.844 --> 50:36.930
The day is at a minimum to
3 degrees warmed up.

50:37.389 --> 50:40.725
And above 5 it will not rise, unfortunately.

50:41.893 --> 50:44.729
Not Sochi, of course, but still.

50:49.274 --> 50:50.859
I'm starting the U-turn.

50:59.868 --> 51:01.536
Have jumped. Come to the left!

51:02.078 --> 51:05.748
We are in space! Where to the left?
For us? By the sun? On the batteries?

51:05.957 --> 51:09.961
Oh, of course, by the sun!
And slower, Vova.

51:10.878 --> 51:13.256
- Hush hush. Stop! Brake!
- I fixed it.

51:17.008 --> 51:19.386
Has earned. Try it.

51:24.098 --> 51:25.559
Fuck.

51:26.810 --> 51:29.438
You see, engineer!

51:30.022 --> 51:31.482
In the spacesuit.

52:00.842 --> 52:02.511
Your mother.

52:04.095 --> 52:05.471
Handsomely.

52:10.934 --> 52:11.977
Cold.

52:21.027 --> 52:22.612
Let's try something.

52:28.910 --> 52:30.370
Well ka. So effective.

52:35.248 --> 52:38.878
See that water on the ship does not
has flown in, it's all to hell.

52:39.170 --> 52:40.421
We're watching.

52:42.673 --> 52:45.176
I'm on the attack, Victor on the gate.

52:45.593 --> 52:49.096
Blow off the water to the engine compartment,
then we will clean.

52:49.722 --> 52:52.725
Eh, we would like several
cleaners with rags.

52:53.100 --> 52:55.561
With this, my brothers, it is taut, of course.

52:56.687 --> 53:00.356
And music is fun for the mood.

53:00.898 --> 53:03.276
Well, we'll organize the music for you right now.

53:03.609 --> 53:09.532
And about rags, you have there than to get hold of yourself:
kombezy, additional. clothes, well, and so on.

53:10.825 --> 53:13.619
Volod, and there is much water there in general?

53:14.703 --> 53:19.708
Valer, how can I tell you.
Uncensored quantity.

53:20.334 --> 53:22.877
Okay, and here's the music for you.

53:38.934 --> 53:44.898
"Wahler, is there anything else?"
- Come on, okay, we joked.

53:48.443 --> 53:51.321
- Oh, another matter.
"That's much better."

53:54.824 --> 53:56.242
- Volodya,
- Yes

53:56.451 --> 53:59.704
- Try to blow ventilation.
- Come on.

54:16.594 --> 54:18.221
Dry like.

54:25.520 --> 54:26.562
Opa.

54:29.440 --> 54:34.153
Victor! Lock the hatch, come on!
Come on! Lock the hatch!

54:48.708 --> 54:51.127
Pamirs, reception. Collected the water?

54:51.502 --> 54:55.965
Yes, almost collected. Only
all rags have already ended.

54:56.924 --> 54:59.343
Even personal things in the course allowed.

55:00.219 --> 55:02.096
Is it warm on the ship?

55:02.513 --> 55:07.184
Well, warmer than at the station.
Tolerant, in general.

55:07.601 --> 55:10.854
Do not forget to measure the temperature
and drink vitamins.

55:11.229 --> 55:13.273
Good good. Do not forget.

55:38.338 --> 55:40.256
Look, do not burn your hands.

55:57.981 --> 56:02.360
- How many do you have?
- Yes, 36.6.

56:07.573 --> 56:10.576
- And you have?
- As many.

56:25.007 --> 56:30.929
Look, see how there between
bags over the sofa,

56:31.722 --> 56:33.432
is there what?

56:54.743 --> 56:59.539
- Good joke.
- And you open it, open it.

57:11.259 --> 57:13.094
How did you carry it?

57:13.553 --> 57:17.097
You fly from mine, you can donkey
in space to take.

57:17.597 --> 57:19.266
Stunned.

57:21.393 --> 57:25.730
Well, on a small? For warming.

57:48.669 --> 57:54.675
"On Earth, it's a dry law."
- The same on Earth. It does not apply to us.

57:55.926 --> 57:58.512
We are still on the territory of the USSR.

58:01.932 --> 58:04.726
Outside the window, like, the police do not fly.

58:08.354 --> 58:10.022
And the truth does not fly.

58:11.190 --> 58:13.567
Well then, give one more.

58:28.331 --> 58:31.501
Volod, you see no one but us?

58:32.460 --> 58:35.796
Cockroach. The first in space.

58:36.296 --> 58:39.216
And I already thought everything, carbon dioxide
breathing in, glitches have begun.

58:39.341 --> 58:41.010
Also what with it to do?

58:46.140 --> 58:48.267
On Earth, I would have crushed it.

58:48.976 --> 58:52.188
It's a pity after all, fellow countryman.

58:55.358 --> 58:58.651
Well, fellow countryman, will you be third?

59:04.157 --> 59:07.952
Stepanich, what are we fighting for, eh?

59:09.954 --> 59:12.123
Why do we risk children.

59:12.999 --> 59:17.503
It's a piece of iron.
20 tons of iron and all.

59:17.795 --> 59:20.839
This is the reputation of Soviet cosmonautics.

59:26.260 --> 59:27.803
Vova Komarov,

59:28.888 --> 59:32.141
Yura Dobrovolsky, Vitya Patsayev,

59:33.017 --> 59:36.312
Vladik Volkov. I remember
about them every day.

59:38.022 --> 59:43.027
Every time I think we should
were made to return them.

59:45.154 --> 59:49.074
- Here's the reputation.
- Then, we could not do anything.

59:51.701 --> 59:55.622
And now I do not understand. What I should do?

59:56.206 --> 01:00:00.585
I'm not there. I do not see what they see.

01:00:01.753 --> 01:00:03.546
I can only hear them.

01:00:05.381 --> 01:00:10.178
20 minutes every half hour.
And then with interference.

01:00:11.679 --> 01:00:14.140
You can make the right decision.

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:16.725
Bring them back.

01:00:18.059 --> 01:00:19.936
Is this the right decision?

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.733
They are the best guys.

01:00:26.609 --> 01:00:29.612
They are created for the cause,
which is now being done.

01:00:30.405 --> 01:00:32.448
And this concerns their honor.

01:00:34.325 --> 01:00:36.327
And the honor of their country.

01:00:36.786 --> 01:00:40.664
And then it's not just 20 tons of metal.

01:00:45.335 --> 01:00:49.464
"Pamirs, do you hear me?"
"Dawn, welcome." We hear you.

01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:51.382
How are you?

01:00:51.758 --> 01:00:54.677
We clean the components of electric circuits.

01:00:56.178 --> 01:00:57.972
How much more water is left?

01:00:58.389 --> 01:01:01.392
Yes, it comes out from all angles.

01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:04.728
We catch it by drop.

01:01:06.856 --> 01:01:11.443
- Pamirs, and you rested?
- Yes. Yes, they rested.

01:01:12.152 --> 01:01:18.659
So, go to the ship
and hang up. Without rest it is impossible, children.

01:01:18.992 --> 01:01:22.245
Not until the rest, Valer. You would have seen,
that here it is created.

01:01:22.496 --> 01:01:26.499
While the water is not understood,
it is better not to stop.

01:01:27.709 --> 01:01:29.085
That's an order.

01:01:29.586 --> 01:01:35.882
- Good. Only the chains will ring and immediately
... - Guys, and how did CSKA play?

01:01:36.174 --> 01:01:41.429
What CSKA? And, we'll find out the account.

01:01:42.806 --> 01:01:44.182
- Valery Petrovich ...
- A little bit later.

01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:48.853
Valery Petrovich! They both have a temperature
under 38, it's time to start antibiotics prick.

01:01:49.062 --> 01:01:53.399
And be sure to have a hot tea, you hear me! Them
you need at least a day not to leave the warm ship.

01:01:53.608 --> 01:01:55.777
My dear, they have nothing left.

01:01:55.944 --> 01:02:00.614
Now they chain will ring, and all they will have - and tea
hot, and warm, and half board, and Sochi - everything will be!

01:02:00.822 --> 01:02:04.743
- Do you even understand what is at stake?
- Yes, I understand.

01:02:18.924 --> 01:02:20.217
Take it.

01:02:28.808 --> 01:02:33.687
Now the battery is connected to solar
batteries, and start the station.

01:02:37.066 --> 01:02:40.861
- There is a contact.
- Has a reorientation begun?

01:02:41.278 --> 01:02:45.991
Now the sensor is trying to find the sun.
To make the batteries unfold to him.

01:02:49.453 --> 01:02:51.787
Do you hear, did the gear go for a turn?

01:03:14.142 --> 01:03:15.935
I can not hear.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:27.988
Sorry the recorder does not work ...

01:03:28.196 --> 01:03:30.282
Inside everything is fine.

01:03:30.532 --> 01:03:34.745
I say, we must go out into space
doing external inspection.

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:45.379
At the next communication session
Pamir-1 comes out, get ready.

01:04:03.355 --> 01:04:06.400
He opened the hatch. The pressure is normal.

01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:08.317
Excellent.

01:04:10.861 --> 01:04:12.738
So, I'm outside.

01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:19.411
The station photo shows minor distortions
The shape of the sensor orientation of solar cells.

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:21.705
Start checking with him.

01:04:22.373 --> 01:04:25.584
Accepted. I'm starting to move.

01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:31.631
- Get around the middle battery on the left.
"I understand, I walk around to my left."

01:04:33.216 --> 01:04:36.051
And here nothing has changed. Everything is familiar.

01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:40.764
- The same Earth, the same Sun?
- Yes, all the same.

01:04:44.227 --> 01:04:49.148
Batteries are worn out, of course, strongly.
Like sails after a circumnavigation.

01:04:50.942 --> 01:04:55.947
Well, cosmic dust is normal.
It is necessary to replace. Volod, move to the sensor.

01:04:56.572 --> 01:04:58.491
I understand you, I'm moving.

01:05:00.241 --> 01:05:04.078
The body of the station is corroded.
Aging, beautiful.

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:08.791
It's too early for her to grow old.
Where are you, above the control room?

01:05:09.917 --> 01:05:12.462
Yes, I turn to the body of the working compartment.

01:05:13.004 --> 01:05:16.882
"Can you see the sensor already?"
"Not yet, I'm moving to him."

01:05:17.633 --> 01:05:20.970
"Are you watching the pressure?"
- Yes, it's normal.

01:05:33.272 --> 01:05:35.900
- Dawn, it's all clear.
"Well, have you found it?"

01:05:36.317 --> 01:05:41.322
Found. It seems that I found.
Vitya, you were right.

01:05:41.614 --> 01:05:42.573
What, sensor?

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:49.038
Yes. Battery orientation sensor housing
bent. Pressed against the surface of the station.

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.750
How could this happen?

01:05:55.126 --> 01:05:59.631
- Traces are there?
"What about without them, Sash!" You would have seen it.

01:06:00.006 --> 01:06:04.386
Scratch your finger in three thicknesses to the sensor.

01:06:05.387 --> 01:06:06.429
Asteroid?

01:06:06.846 --> 01:06:11.768
Well, what else could it be?
It looks like the truck drove in.

01:06:12.227 --> 01:06:13.937
And it will turn out?

01:06:14.229 --> 01:06:18.398
Unscrew, I'm afraid, will not work.
You can not get close to the nuts. They are pressed.

01:06:20.066 --> 01:06:21.651
And if you beat her off?

01:06:21.735 --> 01:06:25.488
Guys, there's a thick metal,
you can not beat him like that.

01:06:26.573 --> 01:06:30.410
Let the technicians repeat the same
position of the sensor on the layout.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.870
I'll do it now.

01:06:32.871 --> 01:06:34.122
Okay, guys,

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:37.959
it's good that they found the reason.

01:06:39.001 --> 01:06:43.088
We will think what to do.
Come back for now.

01:06:43.505 --> 01:06:47.717
I would stay here for now. I would have examined the station.

01:06:48.218 --> 01:06:52.347
I have enough oxygen, which I will
go here to run, the atmosphere to waste.

01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:56.642
And while you are thinking about the next
session decide what to do.

01:06:57.185 --> 01:06:59.187
Confirm the connection, the reception.

01:06:59.854 --> 01:07:01.564
Pamir, can you hear me?

01:07:06.902 --> 01:07:11.115
Dawn, dawn, I'm Pamir-1, reception.

01:07:11.991 --> 01:07:16.495
Vitya, have you lost the Earth, too?
Victor, answer me, reception.

01:07:17.913 --> 01:07:21.708
Pamir-2, I'm Pamir-1,
how do you hear me, reception?

01:07:30.592 --> 01:07:33.803
Victor! Pamir-2!

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.263
Victor.

01:07:40.267 --> 01:07:42.853
Dawn, we have smoke at the station!

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.398
Victor! Victor!

01:07:56.783 --> 01:07:59.452
Dawn, we have a fire on the ship!

01:08:00.328 --> 01:08:04.247
Victor, Vitya, put on your spacesuit! Obgorish!

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:09.294
Victor! Dock the ship for fuck!
Close the hatch and shoot!

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:16.259
Shooting until the station caught fire!
Hold on! Hold on.

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:27.812
Victor!

01:08:56.171 --> 01:08:57.171
Victor!

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:06.614
Come out come on.

01:10:12.118 --> 01:10:18.082
- Why are not you sleeping?
- I'm fine, but why are you awake?

01:10:44.982 --> 01:10:50.447
Pamirs, reception. How do you hear me?
This is the Earth, answer.

01:10:51.739 --> 01:10:53.449
Pamirs, reception.

01:10:54.492 --> 01:10:57.286
Volodya, Victor. How do you hear me?

01:10:57.453 --> 01:11:00.456
Valery Petrovich, station in the shade,
there is no connection.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:06.920
Well, comrades, it's time.
It's time to decide something ...

01:11:08.838 --> 01:11:12.842
- We will wait for the next communication session.
- We have been waiting 8 hours.

01:11:13.635 --> 01:11:16.429
Because of your haste, we are without
training flew,

01:11:16.596 --> 01:11:19.891
so now we will wait
as much as we need, okay?

01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:24.020
Do you think that I do not know what it is
you left the astronauts at the station,

01:11:24.186 --> 01:11:27.772
when he could and should return them!
It's you who ditched them!

01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:29.649
Stop it!

01:11:30.525 --> 01:11:33.569
I'll see, I'll make sure
you answered for all this!

01:11:33.861 --> 01:11:36.531
And I will not look at the fact that you
Hero of the Soviet Union!

01:11:36.697 --> 01:11:40.201
Twice a hero.
And if necessary, I will answer.

01:11:41.118 --> 01:11:42.286
You answer.

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:50.544
CNN broadcast the launch
American Shuttle.

01:11:50.794 --> 01:11:52.630
Display on the big screen?

01:11:53.254 --> 01:11:56.257
Have we seen their Shuttles take off?

01:11:57.675 --> 01:12:00.262
So, in places. We are waiting for communication.

01:12:20.447 --> 01:12:23.241
VÃ­t, how are you there?

01:12:26.078 --> 01:12:29.873
The shuttle flew up the American shuttle.

01:12:32.417 --> 01:12:36.087
Oh, Vitya, Vitya, you're not lightly sunburned ...

01:12:46.012 --> 01:12:48.014
Yes, yes, we check.

01:12:48.682 --> 01:12:56.481
Apogee 52 555 Perigee 25 554
Room temperature 0

01:12:57.232 --> 01:13:02.153
- Temperature of the instrument compartment ...
- Dawn, I'm Pamir-1. Do you hear me?

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.240
- Dawn,
- Pamirs, reception.

01:13:06.407 --> 01:13:09.410
- this is Pamir 1.
"Pamirs, welcome!" The Pamirs are in touch!

01:13:09.702 --> 01:13:11.411
Pamirs, reception, we listen to you!

01:13:13.164 --> 01:13:15.124
"Welcome, Volodya!"
- Yes, Valera.

01:13:15.374 --> 01:13:18.460
What's wrong with you? You were not connected for 9 hours.

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:21.797
We had a fire. The ship was burnt.

01:13:22.381 --> 01:13:25.634
Vitya extinguished it by depressurization.
We're at the station now.

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:28.720
- How is he? What about Vitya?
- Scorched heavily.

01:13:29.054 --> 01:13:32.724
"Is he conscious?"
- Yes, in the mind. Only the smoke heavily inhaled.

01:13:32.974 --> 01:13:35.977
"Can you get on the ship and report the situation?"
- I can.

01:13:36.894 --> 01:13:38.103
I'm worried about Vitya.

01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:43.066
Vladimir Petrovich, Pamir-2
2 capsules of MP-24 and one BK-12.

01:13:43.275 --> 01:13:44.526
Repeat after 6 hours.

01:13:44.818 --> 01:13:48.447
OK I understood. Valer, in general, so ...

01:13:49.072 --> 01:13:51.533
The oxygen supply station is burned out.

01:13:51.825 --> 01:13:54.161
Most likely, the saber caught fire.

01:13:54.536 --> 01:13:59.332
The ventilation system also does not work.
There is nothing to breathe. There is almost no air.

01:13:59.749 --> 01:14:02.543
Look, on the ship though
anything works?

01:14:03.836 --> 01:14:08.840
So, I'm checking. Central unit
data does not reflect.

01:14:11.343 --> 01:14:13.678
The ship does not react to commands.

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:18.975
- Is the wiring fused too?
"Valer, everything is melted here."

01:14:21.102 --> 01:14:26.108
Everything is not very good. I'm afraid that
You can not dump the station into the ocean any more.

01:14:26.442 --> 01:14:28.651
The ship is now unmanageable.

01:14:29.485 --> 01:14:30.820
Understand you.

01:14:34.532 --> 01:14:37.410
Now we will think how
you to return to the land.

01:14:38.744 --> 01:14:41.789
We can not allow Americans
to our station.

01:14:41.997 --> 01:14:43.624
I agree.

01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:45.834
We know what they need.

01:14:46.252 --> 01:14:50.547
It is impossible to let Americans
Our advanced technologies have fallen into the hands.

01:14:51.256 --> 01:14:55.301
So, we will shoot down the station before,
how the Americans will fly to it.

01:15:00.055 --> 01:15:04.560
Comrades, do you remember, in general,
that there are two of our astronauts?

01:15:04.977 --> 01:15:07.104
And what can you do?

01:15:12.693 --> 01:15:14.611
Give me three hours.

01:15:25.871 --> 01:15:30.417
- Has the control unit been opened?
- Opened it! Everything is melted here.

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:34.421
Bad. Disconnect everything,
until the batteries have sat down.

01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:35.922
It is done.

01:15:46.641 --> 01:15:48.685
- You heard?
- What?

01:15:53.106 --> 01:15:54.983
Did you hear the sound of the docking?

01:15:57.985 --> 01:15:59.695
Wait, you what, what docking?

01:15:59.862 --> 01:16:02.657
We must open the hatch, the shuttle docked.

01:16:03.324 --> 01:16:03.991
Whatever ...

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.953
American ship! I saw him
flying. He will help us, bring us back to earth!

01:16:08.037 --> 01:16:10.289
Vitya, are you crazy? He can not
to us to dock!

01:16:10.414 --> 01:16:11.539
He docked.

01:16:11.789 --> 01:16:14.667
Victor, stop it! There is nothing there,
you can not open the hatch!

01:16:14.876 --> 01:16:17.295
Let go! I heard the sound of docking.

01:16:17.503 --> 01:16:18.713
You have misunderstood it!

01:16:18.963 --> 01:16:24.301
This is a glitch! This is from lack of oxygen and from
obezbalivajushchego, that I have pierced you.

01:16:24.552 --> 01:16:27.847
Let go, you bastard! It's you
to die here flew,

01:16:28.055 --> 01:16:31.600
but I want to live! On Earth, you hear!

01:16:45.237 --> 01:16:48.991
"Do not touch the pen!" Do not touch!
- Let go!

01:16:49.366 --> 01:16:52.370
"There's no one there!"
- Let go, you bastard! Let go!

01:16:52.662 --> 01:16:55.957
You have misunderstood it! It happens.

01:16:56.458 --> 01:17:02.213
I also thought that the angels,
but there were no angels.

01:17:05.465 --> 01:17:09.553
And remember ... remember you brought chestnuts?

01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:11.054
I remember.

01:17:11.763 --> 01:17:16.434
And what is in them such, I do not understand.
Potatoes are like potatoes.

01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:19.312
Yes, I did not understand myself.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.709
Technically undock
a ship by hand is possible.

01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:45.837
There are pyrobolts. The team is mechanical,
there is no binding to electronics.

01:17:45.962 --> 01:17:47.338
And how much will they fall?

01:17:47.547 --> 01:17:49.632
Now they are at an altitude of 180 km perigee.

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:54.594
Through four turns they will cross the conventional boundary
with the atmosphere and will begin to fall precipitously.

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:57.764
And when they land?

01:17:58.014 --> 01:18:01.350
In 67 hours and forty minutes.
With an error of 20 minutes.

01:18:01.517 --> 01:18:02.811
The place of the fall?

01:18:03.103 --> 01:18:05.772
Tentatively - here in this area.

01:18:06.064 --> 01:18:10.068
"What does it mean in this area, it's the entire Indian Ocean!"
- It is not possible to calculate precisely.

01:18:10.235 --> 01:18:13.655
"Valery Petrovich, they can not reach the ground."
- Why?

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:17.325
To restore the atmosphere at the station
they used almost all the oxygen.

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:20.953
Look, there are 5 cylinders left.
with oxygen for 4 hours - this is for 20 hours.

01:18:21.161 --> 01:18:23.914
Plus large air tanks
mixture is at 40

01:18:24.039 --> 01:18:27.918
And in gas masks 8 more hours.
Total 68 hours is in general.

01:18:28.043 --> 01:18:30.170
For 34 hours for each.

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:32.214
How much do they lack in the end?

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.132
The same amount. And no more ...

01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:38.136
What do you mean no! Which means no,
then we think! We think!

01:18:38.345 --> 01:18:42.807
We communicate with the Pamirs, we search everywhere.
In every used cylinder!

01:18:43.141 --> 01:18:46.059
Every breath of air,
every molecule of oxygen!

01:18:46.268 --> 01:18:49.354
Valera, we checked everything.

01:18:49.604 --> 01:18:52.065
We can only return one person.

01:18:52.357 --> 01:18:55.360
And that is not guaranteed.
They have too little oxygen.

01:18:59.698 --> 01:19:02.742
"One will be enough for one."
- What did you say?

01:19:02.951 --> 01:19:04.744
They have 8 ampoules omnopon.

01:19:04.869 --> 01:19:08.247
It depresses breathing and slows down
oxygen consumption.

01:19:08.456 --> 01:19:10.333
One can definitely be returned.

01:19:20.009 --> 01:19:21.802
That's just who to return?

01:19:21.969 --> 01:19:26.640
The commander must remain on the ship.
Such an order.

01:19:30.394 --> 01:19:33.981
It is necessary to undock exactly
at 17 hours, 34 minutes, 40 seconds

01:19:34.398 --> 01:19:39.193
It is necessary to tell them now.
Otherwise they will not have time to prepare.

01:20:01.506 --> 01:20:03.841
Sash, connect me in the office.

01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:35.413
Volod, Vyt, can you hear me?

01:20:36.456 --> 01:20:39.167
Dawn, I'm Pamir-1, we hear you.

01:20:41.252 --> 01:20:42.628
How is Vitya?

01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:45.089
In the mind.

01:20:45.756 --> 01:20:47.091
He hears us?

01:20:48.134 --> 01:20:49.635
No, he does not.

01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:53.806
There is no time, I'm short.

01:20:54.723 --> 01:20:56.641
You have little oxygen.

01:20:57.475 --> 01:21:00.561
You can return only one to the ground.

01:21:00.811 --> 01:21:02.271
Do you hear me?

01:21:04.106 --> 01:21:05.274
Yes, I do.

01:21:05.858 --> 01:21:07.485
Collect all the oxygen

01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:11.447
and undock Alyokhin exactly
at 17 hours, 34 minutes, 40 seconds.

01:21:11.614 --> 01:21:13.073
How did you understand me?

01:21:14.074 --> 01:21:15.951
I understood you. Will be fulfilled.

01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:22.039
It will land in the Indian region
of the ocean. The cruiser had already gone there.

01:21:24.959 --> 01:21:31.465
- And how did CSKA play?
- I won from Spartacus. 2: 1.

01:21:32.675 --> 01:21:33.967
It's good.

01:21:37.513 --> 01:21:39.514
Well, see you then.

01:21:41.768 --> 01:21:42.894
Volod,

01:21:44.395 --> 01:21:46.105
forgive me.

01:22:37.278 --> 01:22:40.613
And what were you thinking about Madagascar?

01:22:41.364 --> 01:22:45.409
I thought it would be if I
from space will land on Madagascar?

01:22:46.035 --> 01:22:50.539
Probably, the local Papuans will see
as I fall, they will find me,

01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:54.419
and make the leader of his tribe,

01:22:55.879 --> 01:23:01.593
but I'll tell them about space,
about the universe, about the stars,

01:23:04.137 --> 01:23:08.140
and very little what I have
there was life in the USSR

01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:13.228
And what was your life like in the USSR?

01:23:15.063 --> 01:23:16.856
Well, tell me.

01:23:19.984 --> 01:23:24.989
Daughter, wife, football

01:23:26.366 --> 01:23:28.785
and the building of communism.

01:23:29.911 --> 01:23:33.038
Yes, it sounds very boring.

01:23:34.623 --> 01:23:39.127
Compared to the view from space
on the African continent.

01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:43.798
But I love it all.

01:24:03.942 --> 01:24:05.193
Nina!

01:24:07.279 --> 01:24:09.782
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:24:11.241 --> 01:24:12.451
Hey.

01:24:17.372 --> 01:24:19.124
Something happened?

01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:22.126
You need to talk to him.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:35.847
Now...

01:24:42.687 --> 01:24:44.689
"Hello, Nin.
- Hi.

01:24:46.524 --> 01:24:51.320
- There they have problems, and we decided to give you
opportunity ... - I know everything. When is the connection?

01:24:51.904 --> 01:24:54.489
They are in touch. Let's go to?

01:25:14.549 --> 01:25:15.842
The Pamirs,

01:25:16.843 --> 01:25:20.473
- Guys, Pamirs
- Yes, Dawn, welcome.

01:25:23.225 --> 01:25:27.605
Volodya, Nina is here.
I want to talk to you.

01:25:48.332 --> 01:25:53.462
"Nina, can you hear me?"
"Yes, I hear you."

01:25:56.298 --> 01:25:58.383
Thank you for coming.

01:26:01.094 --> 01:26:06.348
- How is Olya?
- She is here. She wants to talk to you.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.143
Dad, hello, where are you?

01:26:10.686 --> 01:26:15.190
"Hello, daughter."
- Dad, hello, where are you?

01:26:15.858 --> 01:26:20.320
"You know, I'm far away."
- In the sky?

01:26:22.447 --> 01:26:26.952
- Exactly, in the sky.
"Will you come back soon?"

01:26:35.418 --> 01:26:42.133
- Well, at first I need something here
Finish - Okay then. We are waiting for you.

01:26:50.558 --> 01:26:52.184
Volodya,

01:26:55.813 --> 01:26:57.605
can you hear me?

01:27:01.234 --> 01:27:02.944
I love you.

01:27:07.448 --> 01:27:09.950
I love you too.

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:16.540
Come back.

01:28:57.761 --> 01:29:01.431
There is nothing to breathe here. What for?

01:29:06.602 --> 01:29:09.771
Well, it's time to undock.

01:29:11.273 --> 01:29:13.066
You're flying home.

01:29:13.942 --> 01:29:17.029
Every 8 hours you will stab yourself
omnopon from the first aid kit.

01:29:17.195 --> 01:29:19.739
Then you have enough oxygen to the Earth.

01:29:20.574 --> 01:29:23.076
You know how to undo manually.

01:29:24.953 --> 01:29:29.415
You'll land somewhere in the Indian
the ocean. You've wanted to go there for a long time.

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.710
Why can not we both be together?

01:29:35.212 --> 01:29:37.297
For two oxygen is not enough ...

01:29:40.091 --> 01:29:42.135
I'm not going anywhere alone.

01:29:45.055 --> 01:29:47.515
Do not say nonsense, your wife gives birth.

01:29:48.391 --> 01:29:52.562
"I'm not going anywhere alone."
"And I order you."

01:29:53.062 --> 01:29:54.605
We're wasting time.

01:29:54.856 --> 01:30:00.402
Listen, we must go out into space and
gouging this sensor housing to the limit,

01:30:00.694 --> 01:30:04.197
then the batteries will start working.
And we will get electricity.

01:30:04.572 --> 01:30:08.744
Regeneration will give oxygen, and we
we can receive a rescue ship.

01:30:09.119 --> 01:30:11.163
It is necessary only to gouge this case.

01:30:11.413 --> 01:30:15.501
- Yes, than we gouged it, a sledgehammer or what?
- We did not even try to do it!

01:30:15.876 --> 01:30:21.173
Listen, Vitya, you understand that if we go out and
do not break this body, no one will return home!

01:30:21.381 --> 01:30:23.758
No one will have enough oxygen,
Do you understand this?

01:30:24.008 --> 01:30:26.719
- I understand it.
"Well, let's go home."

01:30:27.219 --> 01:30:29.221
If I return alone,

01:30:30.472 --> 01:30:34.184
as I am to my child
in the eye I will look?

01:30:36.562 --> 01:30:39.815
And how am I to your child
I'll look into my eyes?

01:31:32.948 --> 01:31:36.202
Do not hold tight. Hands will be ill.

01:31:38.996 --> 01:31:42.039
How do you know that I hold tight?

01:31:42.957 --> 01:31:46.252
I, when I first left,
also held fast.

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.462
Hands then ached.

01:32:38.051 --> 01:32:41.888
- Well, how about you?
- Well. As on the ground.

01:32:46.893 --> 01:32:52.398
Vitya, it turns me.
Secure from the other side.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.532
- Like this?
- Yes, it is.

01:33:33.352 --> 01:33:36.272
Vitya, look, go no?

01:33:44.697 --> 01:33:46.365
Just so far.

01:34:55.805 --> 01:35:00.644
We enter the shadow of the Earth. Now
it will become very cold.

01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:10.778
That's all, Vitya.

01:35:13.572 --> 01:35:15.032
All.

01:35:23.206 --> 01:35:27.210
Well, back to the ship
or will we stay here?

01:36:05.662 --> 01:36:11.669
Never thought why
do some of the cosmonauts have births?

01:36:14.421 --> 01:36:18.175
Well, like this. Thought.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.473
All the tough guys, and some
the girls go out.

01:36:25.890 --> 01:36:27.350
Well yes.

01:36:28.851 --> 01:36:32.938
Maybe because the girls are cool?

01:36:35.274 --> 01:36:37.526
There is no doubt about this.

01:36:40.863 --> 01:36:46.577
And I do not even know how it is there
now. Can give birth already.

01:36:47.411 --> 01:36:50.122
Look at least once.

01:36:52.122 --> 01:36:55.709
No, Vitya. Once in a while it's not enough.

01:36:56.251 --> 01:36:59.922
Yes, once - a little.

01:37:23.193 --> 01:37:25.822
We will shoot down the station.

01:37:29.534 --> 01:37:31.536
We did everything we could.

01:37:34.872 --> 01:37:36.415
And you too.

01:38:06.402 --> 01:38:08.903
As a child my father drove the forest.

01:38:13.574 --> 01:38:15.993
In the cold, the chains were torn.

01:38:21.916 --> 01:38:27.337
Viscosity decreases in the cold,
brittleness increases.

01:38:29.089 --> 01:38:36.720
If you wait until the metal cools down
degrees to a hundred, it can crack.

01:38:38.014 --> 01:38:40.016
Let's try.

01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.729
Before sunrise can be done.

01:38:47.357 --> 01:38:48.691
Come on.

01:39:42.283 --> 01:39:46.203
Come on. Come on!

01:40:46.509 --> 01:40:49.929
- Volodya, this is all
- Not all!

01:40:50.597 --> 01:40:51.681
Yet!

01:42:18.055 --> 01:42:23.310
Guys, your mother. Do you hear me?
We see you!

01:42:24.687 --> 01:42:26.396
What are you doing there?

01:42:28.397 --> 01:42:31.025
Dawn, I'm Pamir-1, I hear you.

01:42:31.275 --> 01:42:37.865
We repair the station. Although no.
It seems that we fixed it.

01:43:35.753 --> 01:43:39.173
Pamirs, reception. Why are you silent?

01:43:39.799 --> 01:43:41.300
How was Lily?

01:43:41.842 --> 01:43:44.886
Has given birth. Girl.

01:43:46.429 --> 01:43:48.181
Congratulations,

01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:52.018
Now you are a real astronaut.

01:47:19.797 --> 01:47:22.216
This is the perfect order, yes, Volodya?

01:47:24.093 --> 01:47:26.595
- How can we see now?
- Perfectly.

01:47:26.804 --> 01:47:30.182
Come on, breathe. This is not visible, excellent.

01:47:30.432 --> 01:47:35.645
Now, can you take off the caps?
And one minute without hats to stand?

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:41.150
Because we owe you all the same
show without hats.

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:46.447
It's all right. if you have
say something, then we are ready.
