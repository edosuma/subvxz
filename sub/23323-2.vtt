00:00.267 --> 00:01.600
E have nots"...

00:01.601 --> 00:03.402
Harrington. You think I did
all of this not to have you?

00:03.404 --> 00:05.471
What do you mean my credit card
is not working?

00:05.473 --> 00:06.805
I canceled all of them.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.974
You can have him come down
to the desk and grovel.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.476
-What you think?
-You're looking at a new truck?

00:10.478 --> 00:13.045
I was thinking I'll talk to
your family, you give me a loan.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.279
I told you,
that's bad money.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.814
I don't know, man.
What choice do I got?

00:15.816 --> 00:18.217
Just know -- if something
happens and they get on you,

00:18.219 --> 00:19.585
there's nothing I can do.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.621
-Where are we?
-We're at my house.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.657
Hey. Hi. I need to borrow
your credit card.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.026
Help me!
Help me!

00:29.463 --> 00:31.563
I smell gas.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.965
Melissa!
-Yeah.

00:32.967 --> 00:33.966
Help me!

00:35.302 --> 00:39.104
Yeah. Go ahead and scream.
No one can hear you.

00:39.106 --> 00:41.340
You wanted to take
the scenic route, remember?

00:41.342 --> 00:42.808
Didn't want to be seen
in my car?

00:42.810 --> 00:44.176
Please!

00:44.178 --> 00:47.246
Look at you. Scared.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.149
Aah! This is not funny!

00:50.151 --> 00:51.884
You know my daddy's dead?

00:51.886 --> 00:55.387
And you didn't care,
did you?

00:55.389 --> 00:56.555
Melissa!

00:56.557 --> 00:58.724
Now, it's your turn.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.626
And jeffery's gonna
dance on your grave.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.594
He hates you like I do.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.265
Go ahead and struggle.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.234
That's making me
enjoy this even more.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.906
Catch your breath, girl.

01:15.910 --> 01:16.942
Ohh!

01:22.049 --> 01:24.016
Please help me!
Please!

01:24.018 --> 01:26.485
-I'm not helping you.
-Please!

01:31.592 --> 01:35.828
I'm gonna sit right here
and wait for you to die.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.830
I've never smelled
fried bitch before.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.803
Oh, yeah.
It looks like it.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.371
What's the girl doing
just sitting there?

01:46.373 --> 01:48.173
I don't know, man. Let's go
check it out. Stop the car.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.546
Oh, miss, miss,
get away from this car.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.249
This thing might blow.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.450
I hope it does.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.419
-Help!
-Yo, is someone in there?

02:00.421 --> 02:02.054
Yo, if somebody's
in there...

02:02.056 --> 02:03.789
-Help! Help!
-Don't -- don't help her.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.124
-Yo, who is that?
-Hello?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.627
Oh, yeah, I can see --
i can see her. She's in there.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.336
��

02:24.303 --> 02:29.706
��

02:29.708 --> 02:34.911
��

02:34.913 --> 02:39.950
��

02:39.952 --> 02:46.089
��

02:46.091 --> 02:47.491
who the hell
are you?

02:47.493 --> 02:50.460
Hi. I'm Isaac.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.929
What are you doing here?
Where's Anna?

02:52.931 --> 02:55.899
Anna won't be working
with you anymore.

02:55.901 --> 02:57.367
What? Why not?

02:57.369 --> 02:59.536
Well, she called and
asked to be reassigned,

02:59.538 --> 03:01.438
so they sent me over.
-What the hell?

03:05.978 --> 03:08.578
Sorry, she --
she won't answer.

03:10.416 --> 03:11.615
Why the hell not?

03:11.617 --> 03:14.084
She's been compromised.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.852
"Compromised"?
What does that mean?

03:15.854 --> 03:17.854
The two of you...

03:17.856 --> 03:19.055
Sleeping together.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.893
Did they fire her?

03:22.895 --> 03:25.262
No. No, no, no.
She was just reassigned.

03:25.264 --> 03:26.696
Okay. Well, I want
to talk to her.

03:28.634 --> 03:30.801
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

03:30.803 --> 03:34.304
All right. I'm paying you.
I want Anna.

03:34.306 --> 03:35.939
I'm sorry, man, but we're here
about your sobriety.

03:35.941 --> 03:37.874
I don't give a damn what
you're here for, why you're --

03:37.876 --> 03:39.443
I want to talk to Anna.

03:39.445 --> 03:42.045
I'm sorry.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.914
Get the hell out of here.

03:43.916 --> 03:45.348
-Go.
-I can help you.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.650
No, you can't help me.

03:46.652 --> 03:50.320
Look, man. I know you're upset.
This is for the best, man.

03:50.322 --> 03:53.457
She's a recovering addict
and felt weak with you.

03:53.459 --> 03:55.992
So, what? She called
and asked to be reassigned.

03:55.994 --> 03:58.995
Now, I'm sorry, but you're still
on a great path, Wyatt.

03:58.997 --> 04:02.332
I can help you work
through all of this.

04:02.334 --> 04:04.668
Why didn't she tell me
she was leaving?

04:04.670 --> 04:07.871
In the past, this is how
we've handled these...

04:07.873 --> 04:09.739
Situations.

04:09.741 --> 04:11.675
-So, she's done this before?
-No, no, no.

04:11.677 --> 04:13.910
She hasn't, but we have had
others who have.

04:13.912 --> 04:15.745
Okay. All right,
get the hell out.

04:15.747 --> 04:17.180
-Wyatt, I can --
-get the hell out.

04:17.182 --> 04:19.683
You're fired.

04:19.685 --> 04:20.951
I'm sorry you feel
this way, man.

04:20.952 --> 04:22.819
You know my number if you nee--
if you need anything --

04:22.821 --> 04:24.120
I need Anna.
Get the hell out of here.

04:24.122 --> 04:25.288
How many times do I have
to say it to you?

04:25.290 --> 04:26.656
Come on. Let's go.

04:26.658 --> 04:28.658
-I'm sorry, man.
-You're sorry. You're sorry.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.126
Hey, are you sure
you want me to leave?

04:30.128 --> 04:33.497
Am I sure?
Is this clear enough for you?

04:33.499 --> 04:35.098
Let's go.
-Wow, you are...

04:35.100 --> 04:36.266
Let's go.
Come on.

04:36.268 --> 04:45.008
��

04:46.144 --> 04:53.650
��

04:53.652 --> 04:55.485
Anna?

04:55.487 --> 04:56.586
Really?

04:56.588 --> 04:58.421
You just walk out
on me like that?

04:58.423 --> 05:03.326
��

05:06.298 --> 05:08.164
So, this is what
you do, huh?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.699
Pardon me?

05:09.701 --> 05:12.168
-Who is this?
<i> -Wyatt cryer?</i>

05:12.170 --> 05:14.437
<i> Is this Wyatt cryer?</i>
-Who is this?

05:14.439 --> 05:17.240
This is Lyle Jefferson with
the Savannah police department.

05:17.242 --> 05:18.408
Yeah?

05:18.410 --> 05:20.110
<i> We have an African</i>
<i> American female</i>

05:20.112 --> 05:22.445
<i> that's trying to use</i>
<i> your ATM card.</i>

05:25.484 --> 05:27.484
<i> -That bitch.</i>
-Do you know her?

05:31.323 --> 05:34.491
<i> -Maybe.</i>
-Well, who is she?

05:34.493 --> 05:37.027
-She tried to rob me.
-Huh.

05:37.029 --> 05:38.795
Well, we're just
trying to make sure

05:38.797 --> 05:40.931
that she's giving us
the right information.

05:40.933 --> 05:43.266
<i> Do you know her name?</i>
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:43.268 --> 05:45.936
It's, uh,
quita Maxwell.

05:45.938 --> 05:47.270
Oh.

05:47.272 --> 05:49.239
<i> Was she able</i>
<i> to get anything?</i>

05:49.241 --> 05:50.907
Well, we're not sure.

05:50.909 --> 05:52.609
Damn it.

05:52.611 --> 05:54.711
Would you like us
to call the bank for you?

05:54.713 --> 05:55.979
<i> What do you mean,</i>
<i> "call the bank"?</i>

05:55.981 --> 05:57.948
Yeah, give them
a police report.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.883
No, no, no.
I'll come down and do it.

05:59.885 --> 06:01.651
Now, listen,
we do it all the time.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.286
No, I'll handle it.

06:03.288 --> 06:04.955
They're gonna need one.

06:04.957 --> 06:07.023
I'll come down there
if they ask for one, okay?

06:07.025 --> 06:08.892
<i> I'll handle it.</i>
-Okay.

06:08.894 --> 06:10.427
All right, is that it?

06:10.429 --> 06:13.330
Yeah. You might want to call
your credit-card companies

06:13.332 --> 06:14.764
and change
your passwords.

06:14.766 --> 06:16.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I will.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.500
<i> Well,</i>
<i> if there's anything --</i>

06:20.272 --> 06:22.172
well, you're an arrogant
little ass, aren't you?

06:22.174 --> 06:28.411
��

06:30.582 --> 06:32.849
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:32.851 --> 06:36.286
What's going on
with you?

06:36.288 --> 06:37.954
-That man.
-Who?

06:37.956 --> 06:39.222
Jim cryer.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.958
-Is he here?
-You know it.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.427
-Is he still the same, old --
-arrogant asshole, yeah.

06:44.429 --> 06:45.962
-Yeah.
-Yeah, still him.

06:47.599 --> 06:48.632
What's up?

06:51.069 --> 06:53.103
-You know what?
-What's that?

06:55.774 --> 06:57.540
I'm gonna get her.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.042
-Get who?
-His wife.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.276
What?

07:00.278 --> 07:01.344
His wife.
I'm gonna get her.

07:01.346 --> 07:03.480
-Mrs. cryer?
-Yeah.

07:03.482 --> 07:05.582
-Why?
-'Cause she's rich.

07:05.584 --> 07:08.251
Oh, come on. Let me tell you --
revenge is a poor excuse

07:08.253 --> 07:10.954
to ruin the really good plan
that we got going on here.

07:12.557 --> 07:16.126
How long do you think we
can keep this operation
going, rocky?

07:16.128 --> 07:17.360
I don't know.

07:19.931 --> 07:22.232
We can't keep a prostitution
ring for very long, rocky.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.566
Yeah, all right.
I know that.

07:23.568 --> 07:27.003
Then, you also know that we need
to start making other plans.

07:27.005 --> 07:30.540
No. What I think we need to do
is get more girls.

07:30.542 --> 07:33.476
Yeah, I don't -- I don't like
that side of it, though.

07:33.478 --> 07:35.245
What do you mean you don't
like -- this was your idea.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.515
Yeah, I know. I just --
i never liked it.

07:38.517 --> 07:41.117
Well, thanks for
dragging me into this.

07:41.119 --> 07:42.986
Oh, you seemed
very willing.

07:42.988 --> 07:44.187
I think we're getting
off track, here.

07:44.189 --> 07:45.689
What we need to do is,
see this thing through.

07:45.691 --> 07:48.224
-Through to what?
-To making some money.

07:49.361 --> 07:51.261
How much is
"some money," rocky?

07:51.263 --> 07:52.996
I need <i> big</i> money.

07:52.998 --> 07:54.964
Broderick, we're gonna
get paid, man.

07:54.966 --> 07:56.666
Nah.

07:56.668 --> 07:58.201
I'm gonna go after her.

07:58.203 --> 08:00.937
That woman is never
gonna deal with you.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.672
Yeah, she will.

08:02.674 --> 08:04.240
How can you be so sure?

08:04.242 --> 08:06.342
Her husband.
That's how I'm so sure.

08:06.344 --> 08:08.578
What does that even mean?

08:08.580 --> 08:12.515
Anyone that's married to a prick
like that isn't happy.

08:12.517 --> 08:14.884
So, you're now gonna
<i> make</i> her happy?

08:14.886 --> 08:17.821
Or at least fool her long
enough for her to think so.

08:17.823 --> 08:20.190
Go ahead.
Good luck with that.

08:20.192 --> 08:21.624
Oh. Skepticism.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.159
No, truth, mate.

08:25.831 --> 08:27.597
How much do you think
she's worth?

08:27.599 --> 08:29.566
I don't know.

08:29.568 --> 08:31.568
$250 million.

08:31.570 --> 08:33.102
-What?
-Yeah.

08:33.105 --> 08:34.671
Old Southern money.

08:34.673 --> 08:36.706
And you know this how?

08:36.707 --> 08:38.842
She's the largest
shareholder of the board.

08:38.844 --> 08:42.378
I asked some questions,
and I got my answers.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.679
Damn. Well...

08:43.682 --> 08:45.648
Yeah. "Damn" is right,
my friend.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.183
That's a lot of money.

08:47.185 --> 08:48.218
Mm-hmm.

08:48.220 --> 08:49.853
And all I have to do
is get in,

08:49.855 --> 08:53.089
make her feel special,
and get him out.

08:53.091 --> 08:56.159
Wow.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.927
Are you doubting me?

08:57.929 --> 08:59.262
Yes, I doubt.
Come on.

08:59.264 --> 09:01.531
Let me tell you something
about old Savannah, shall I?

09:01.533 --> 09:03.700
Everything here
is about appearance,

09:03.702 --> 09:05.802
and there is no way --
I'm telling you no way --

09:05.804 --> 09:08.571
that she would be seen dead
in public with you on her arm.

09:08.573 --> 09:10.140
Yeah, she will.

09:10.142 --> 09:12.175
Okay.

09:14.446 --> 09:15.879
-You know what?
-What?

09:15.881 --> 09:18.648
I'm gonna get started
on my plan right now.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.618
I just don't want you
to jeopardize our plan.

09:21.620 --> 09:22.685
I won't.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.621
Are you sure about that?

09:24.623 --> 09:26.990
I got this figured out.

09:26.992 --> 09:28.491
All right.
If you say so.

09:28.493 --> 09:31.494
Get back to work.
Keep folding those napkins.

09:31.496 --> 09:32.962
Thank you, hotel manager.

09:32.964 --> 09:40.370

Hi.

09:59.658 --> 10:01.057
Can I help you?

10:01.059 --> 10:02.592
Yeah. I'm here to see
about a sink?

10:02.594 --> 10:04.427
Katheryn cryer sent me.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.162
Oh, yeah. Come on in.

10:06.164 --> 10:07.163
Thanks.

10:07.165 --> 10:12.101

10:12.103 --> 10:13.603
the kitchen is back there.

10:13.605 --> 10:14.637
Yeah, I know.

10:14.639 --> 10:20.343
��

10:20.345 --> 10:22.245
you got here quick.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.047
Well, I take pride
in my work.

10:24.049 --> 10:25.348
Oh.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.417
I built this place.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.185
Oh, okay.

10:29.187 --> 10:30.787
I'm Derek David.

10:30.789 --> 10:33.122
Hanna.

10:33.124 --> 10:34.490
Was that you
i heard singing?

10:34.492 --> 10:35.892
No.

10:35.894 --> 10:37.727
You heard me?

10:37.729 --> 10:39.395
Yeah.

10:39.397 --> 10:40.930
You must not be
that good of a builder

10:40.932 --> 10:42.732
if the walls
are that thin.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.467
I'm sorry, I --

10:44.469 --> 10:45.802
I was just kidding.

10:48.907 --> 10:50.540
So, how long's it
been leaking?

10:50.542 --> 10:52.876
I don't know.
I just moved in.

10:52.878 --> 10:54.611
Oh, so, you bought
the place from Mrs. cryer.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.513
No. I'm just staying here
till I can find a house.

10:57.515 --> 10:59.616
Oh, so you looking for
a house.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.451
One day.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.487
-This is a nice place.
-I can't afford it.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.023
You should see some of
the other places I built.

11:07.025 --> 11:09.359
They're nice.
Half the price.

11:09.361 --> 11:12.295
You got anything
a third of the price?

11:12.297 --> 11:14.163
We do, actually.

11:14.165 --> 11:15.598
But they're on
the other side of town.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.600
That's all right.
I'm used to that.

11:17.602 --> 11:20.003
I lived over there
for 35 years of my life.

11:20.005 --> 11:23.573
Okay.
I will leave you my card.

11:23.575 --> 11:25.108
Okay. Thank you.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.476
Sure.

11:27.679 --> 11:29.345
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

11:36.021 --> 11:37.954
Hello?

11:37.956 --> 11:39.122
Yes. This is she.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.527
The morgue?

11:44.529 --> 11:45.628
What?

11:47.899 --> 11:49.065
Yes.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.536
��

11:53.538 --> 11:54.771
where were they?

11:54.773 --> 11:58.374
��

11:58.376 --> 11:59.676
in his pocket.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.480
Yes.

12:04.482 --> 12:06.115
Yes, I will -- I will.

12:06.117 --> 12:07.450
I'll come down
and get him.

12:07.452 --> 12:09.819
Yes, thank you.

12:09.821 --> 12:10.853
Thank you.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.890

12:18.129 --> 12:24.267
��

12:24.269 --> 12:29.973
��

12:29.975 --> 12:33.209
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to
shut the water off.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.945
I know you've been
doing the dishes.

12:35.947 --> 12:38.748
It's fine.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.417
Are you okay?

12:41.419 --> 12:42.518
Yeah.

12:44.456 --> 12:47.190
Are you sure?

12:47.192 --> 12:50.893
My grandson was murdered.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.261
I'm so sorry.

12:52.263 --> 12:54.464
And that was the morgue,

12:54.466 --> 12:56.199
saying they found something
in his pockets,

12:56.201 --> 12:59.469
and I had to come down
and get him.

12:59.471 --> 13:02.772
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

13:02.774 --> 13:04.040
I'm sorry.

13:04.042 --> 13:06.909
Listen, if you need to turn
the water off, go ahead.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.878
It's fine.

13:08.880 --> 13:09.912
Okay.

13:11.683 --> 13:14.951
Is there anything
i can do?

13:14.953 --> 13:17.220
Yeah.

13:17.222 --> 13:19.222
You can fix the sink.

13:21.993 --> 13:25.828
H-how long
will you be?

13:25.830 --> 13:28.498
I should be done
in a couple hours.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.733
Okay.

13:30.735 --> 13:33.302
Thank you.

13:33.304 --> 13:34.537
Sure.

13:34.539 --> 13:40.610

hello?

14:05.370 --> 14:07.036
Hey.

14:07.038 --> 14:08.037
<i> Is he there?</i>

14:08.039 --> 14:09.338
Is who...?

14:09.340 --> 14:11.941
The builder?
-He's cute. Isn't he?

14:11.943 --> 14:14.010
I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon?

14:14.012 --> 14:15.478
Too soon?

14:15.480 --> 14:18.281
Listen, katheryn, I just got
a call from the morgue.

14:18.283 --> 14:21.451
<i> They found some things</i>
<i> in little q's pocket,</i>

14:21.453 --> 14:23.486
<i> and I have to go down</i>
<i> and get it.</i>

14:23.488 --> 14:25.421
Hanna, what?

14:25.423 --> 14:26.489
Yeah.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.091
I -- do you want me
to go with you?

14:28.093 --> 14:29.692
No, no, no. I'll go.

14:29.694 --> 14:33.963
I just wanted to know if it was
okay to leave this guy here.

14:33.965 --> 14:35.398
Oh, Derek? Yes, he's --

14:35.400 --> 14:36.799
he's very trustworthy.

14:36.801 --> 14:39.569
-Okay.
-Hanna, I'm sorry.

14:39.571 --> 14:41.304
<i> It's okay.</i>

14:41.306 --> 14:42.572
Are you sure you don't
want me to go?

14:42.574 --> 14:45.174
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.909
Well, call me
when you're done.

14:46.911 --> 14:49.312
-Yeah, okay. I will.
-Okay.

14:49.314 --> 14:50.513
<i> I'll talk</i>
<i> to you later.</i>

14:53.518 --> 14:58.654
��

14:58.656 --> 15:02.959
��

15:02.961 --> 15:05.661
wow.
You work fast.

15:05.663 --> 15:07.830
You shopped fast.

15:07.832 --> 15:09.132
I only got a few things.

15:09.134 --> 15:11.868
Well, I just needed a bed.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.703
That would be the most
important thing to you.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.973
Well, of course.
We need somewhere to sleep.

15:16.975 --> 15:18.074
Oh, do we?

15:18.076 --> 15:19.876
Yes, we do.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.178
Buy yourself
some nice things?

15:22.180 --> 15:24.547
Yeah.
I only spent $400.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.648
Oh, come on.
Really?

15:25.650 --> 15:27.583
I asked you to buy
yourself a nice --

15:27.585 --> 15:32.088
no, no, no, no, no, that --
i -- this is more than enough.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.957
Okay.
So...

15:34.959 --> 15:37.827
Like the bed?

15:37.829 --> 15:39.228
It -- it's nice.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.897
Mm-hmm.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.066
I was hoping
you'd like it.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.735
Okay, it's
a little masculine.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.936
Oh, I see.

15:46.938 --> 15:49.705
So, what, you're gonna help me
with my feminine side?

15:49.707 --> 15:51.174
I <i> am</i> your feminine side.

15:51.176 --> 15:52.842
Yes, you are.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.878
And there
it goes again.

15:55.880 --> 16:00.016
Oh. Well,
check who it is.

16:00.018 --> 16:03.152
It's an unknown number,
so I am not going to answer.

16:03.154 --> 16:05.454
Well, it could
be important.

16:05.456 --> 16:09.458
Important calls have numbers
attached to them in my phone.

16:09.460 --> 16:12.094
Oh. Well, I hope
I'm one of them.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.095
Yes, you are.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.732
��

16:18.436 --> 16:24.874
�
yes, you are.

16:24.876 --> 16:26.175
Hi. May I help you?

16:26.177 --> 16:27.610
Hi. I need to
pay for another night.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.644
Your name?

16:28.646 --> 16:31.080
Candace young.
Room 3031.

16:32.850 --> 16:36.452
Uh, looks like
it's already been paid for.

16:36.454 --> 16:39.422
-It has?
-Yes, ma'am. For 30 days.

16:39.424 --> 16:41.591
-What?
-Yeah.

16:41.593 --> 16:43.659
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

16:43.661 --> 16:46.929
Unless you think there's been
some sort of mistake.

16:46.931 --> 16:49.699
No, um,
i must have forgotten.

16:49.701 --> 16:51.367
Okay.

16:51.369 --> 16:53.069
What credit card
is on file?

16:53.071 --> 16:56.706
Uh, looks like it was
paid for in cash.

16:56.708 --> 16:58.908
Yes.
That -- that is why.

16:58.910 --> 17:01.377
Okay. Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

17:01.379 --> 17:07.750
��

17:07.752 --> 17:11.420
hi.
Is rocky or r.K. Here?

17:11.422 --> 17:13.021
Can I have a vodka tonic,
please?

17:16.794 --> 17:19.362
-Well, hello, hello.
-Get the hell away from me.

17:19.364 --> 17:20.863
Come on. Is that any way
to talk to the guy

17:20.865 --> 17:23.833
that just paid your hotel bill
for the next month?

17:23.835 --> 17:27.002
-Why?
-Because I'm a great guy.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.537
What do you mean, "why?"

17:28.539 --> 17:31.207
What I just asked you
was why.

17:31.209 --> 17:32.708
Why'd you do it?

17:32.710 --> 17:35.511
Because, Candace,
i still have that mark.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.579
Well,
I'm not interested.

17:36.581 --> 17:38.581
Thank you.

17:38.583 --> 17:39.749
So, what are you gonna do?

17:39.751 --> 17:42.818
You gonna sit around here,
robbing old men?

17:42.820 --> 17:45.488
If that's what it takes.

17:45.490 --> 17:48.958
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so angry?

17:48.960 --> 17:50.960
-Don't you dare.
-What?

17:50.962 --> 17:52.995
I wouldn't be so angry
if you didn't steal my money.

17:52.997 --> 17:55.731
Candace,
I'm not paying you back.

17:55.733 --> 17:56.932
I'm trying to help you.

17:56.934 --> 17:59.535
Get away from me,
Oscar, please.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.771
What is so wrong with
hooking up with this guy?

18:01.773 --> 18:03.172
He's gonna be president.

18:03.174 --> 18:04.307
He's moved on.

18:04.309 --> 18:05.574
No, he hasn't.

18:05.576 --> 18:07.109
Yes, he has.

18:07.111 --> 18:08.778
He still asks about you.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.579
How do you know that?

18:10.581 --> 18:13.816
'Cause I have people
on the inside.

18:13.818 --> 18:16.786
Oscar, just leave
me alone, please.

18:16.788 --> 18:19.088
Fine.
I'll go cancel your stay.

18:19.090 --> 18:20.656
Okay.

18:20.658 --> 18:23.759
No, seriously.
What's your plan?

18:23.761 --> 18:26.362
Are you just gonna sit around
here until you run out of money?

18:26.364 --> 18:27.863
Or till you go to jail

18:27.865 --> 18:31.867
or until one of these Johns
has enough balls to kill you?

18:31.869 --> 18:35.137
My plan is to get you
the hell away from me.

18:35.139 --> 18:37.740
Well, I am trying to --

18:37.742 --> 18:39.742
One second.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.010
Hello?

18:41.012 --> 18:42.845
Yeah, thanks
for returning my call.

18:42.847 --> 18:44.046
Yeah,
i-I'm trying to find out

18:44.048 --> 18:47.583
if you have a quita Maxwell
arrested there.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.318
Oh, you do. Okay.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.854
All right, well,
thank you very much.

18:53.991 --> 18:56.092
Uh,
what do you know about her?

18:56.094 --> 18:57.793
What?

18:57.795 --> 18:59.462
You want me to talk to you?

18:59.464 --> 19:02.465
You talk to me.

19:02.467 --> 19:05.901
Okay.
She robbed somebody,

19:05.903 --> 19:07.536
and I'm trying to get
some information

19:07.538 --> 19:09.004
to do a recovery deal.

19:09.006 --> 19:10.506
Who's the person you're trying
to do the deal for?

19:10.508 --> 19:12.908
-Candace.
-Tell me.

19:12.910 --> 19:15.311
Is it...

19:15.313 --> 19:17.813
Jim cryer?

19:17.815 --> 19:19.315
Yes, it's his son.

19:19.317 --> 19:20.716
His son?

19:20.718 --> 19:23.152
Yeah, I'm trying to get back
his son's inheritance.

19:23.154 --> 19:25.154
Well, that should be easy.
He's an idiot.

19:25.156 --> 19:27.223
-Oh, you know him?
-Yeah, I do.

19:27.225 --> 19:29.425
But what does that
have to do with quita?

19:29.427 --> 19:31.327
She robbed him, and she's
using his credit cards.

19:31.329 --> 19:33.529
Another idiot.

19:33.531 --> 19:36.499
-What, do you know her?
-Mm-hmm.

19:36.501 --> 19:37.767
Hey, I have an idea.

19:37.769 --> 19:39.402
What?

19:39.404 --> 19:41.137
Why don't you talk
to her for me?

19:41.139 --> 19:43.272
Hell, no.
I can't stand that crackhead.

19:43.274 --> 19:46.542
-Oh, it's like that?
-Yeah.

19:46.544 --> 19:48.577
So, you're trying to get
his inheritance back --

19:48.579 --> 19:50.946
his $12 million, right?

19:50.948 --> 19:53.482
-How did you know?
-I told you I know them.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.017
Okay...?

19:55.019 --> 19:56.786
What if I helped you?

19:56.788 --> 19:58.988
-No, I already got this.
-No.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.656
What if I was able to get
the account information?

20:00.658 --> 20:02.658
How much would I get?
-Candace, I already got this.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.827
You already said
the guy was an idiot.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.796
Okay. Good luck.

20:08.866 --> 20:12.401
So,
let me ask you a question.

20:12.403 --> 20:14.203
Do you have any idea

20:14.205 --> 20:16.405
how much first ladies make
when they leave office?

20:16.407 --> 20:18.374
-I don't care.
-Millions.

20:18.376 --> 20:20.709
They write books.
They have speaking engagements.

20:20.711 --> 20:22.077
I'm not interested.

20:22.079 --> 20:24.580
Then you're a fool.
You're a damn fool.

20:24.582 --> 20:26.816
This thing's already
primed, ready to go,

20:26.818 --> 20:29.051
and you'd rather sit here
and bully old men.

20:29.053 --> 20:32.321
Yep. That's me.

20:32.323 --> 20:34.056
What is wrong with you?

20:34.058 --> 20:35.825
What happened to you?

20:35.827 --> 20:39.261
When I first met you,
you had this fire in you,

20:39.263 --> 20:42.731
and now you're just like
some regular, old whore

20:42.733 --> 20:46.435
waiting for the next John.

20:46.437 --> 20:49.638
And you're keeping him
from approaching me.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.774
You skated this thing
with the body.

20:51.776 --> 20:54.210
And now you've got
some kid sitting in jail

20:54.212 --> 20:57.246
for the murder that
you are responsible for.

20:57.248 --> 20:58.781
-What?
-Yeah.

20:58.783 --> 21:00.149
Harrington.

21:00.151 --> 21:01.617
What?

21:01.619 --> 21:05.054
Yeah, jeffery harrington is
sitting in jail for the murder.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.425
Wait.
How do you know that?

21:09.427 --> 21:11.994
Come on.
You don't know my name by now?

21:11.996 --> 21:14.230
Actually, I don't.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.198
So, jeffery's in jail.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.535
Yeah.
And if I were you,

21:19.537 --> 21:21.871
I would start thinking
about securing my future,

21:21.873 --> 21:24.707
just in case good old boy
decided he wanted to talk.

21:26.878 --> 21:29.144
You feel me?

21:29.146 --> 21:32.748
Don't say, "you feel me?"
That's so '90s.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.017
You're running out of time.

21:35.019 --> 21:36.018
Candace.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.152
Ugh.

21:37.154 --> 21:39.755
Get away from me!

21:39.757 --> 21:41.957
Nice trick.

21:41.959 --> 21:48.397

21:48.399 --> 21:50.366
<i> Hi. Leave a message.</i>

Call me back.

21:57.475 --> 22:03.746

Are you okay?

25:00.040 --> 25:02.007
I'm fine.

25:02.009 --> 25:03.976
I hate
that you're in here.

25:03.978 --> 25:05.844
Yeah. Me, too.

25:05.846 --> 25:08.580
Were you able
to find my dad?

25:08.582 --> 25:10.449
I found a cell number
on him.

25:10.451 --> 25:12.184
He's not answering.

25:12.186 --> 25:15.654
I need you to get me
my phone, then.

25:15.656 --> 25:17.256
I got it.

25:17.258 --> 25:20.125
What's your password?

25:20.127 --> 25:22.494
6858.

25:22.496 --> 25:25.130
He'll -- he'll
answer my call.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.832
Okay. 6858.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.734
All right.
It's in my locker.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.969
I'll get it.

25:30.971 --> 25:34.039
Thank you.

25:34.041 --> 25:35.574
Hey.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.576
You're gonna be okay.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.545
All right.

25:39.547 --> 25:42.047
All right, well,
take me back to my cell.

25:44.652 --> 25:47.052
It's shift change.

25:47.054 --> 25:48.587
We got some time.

25:50.624 --> 25:52.524
Ah, okay.

25:52.526 --> 25:53.725
Hmm.

25:53.727 --> 25:55.828
You're into this?

25:57.631 --> 25:59.798
Come on.
I-i-i don't like this.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.000
Anybody could walk in
at any time.

26:02.002 --> 26:04.937
That's what makes it fun.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.972
You think your wife
thinks that it's fun?

26:06.974 --> 26:11.977
��

26:11.979 --> 26:13.212
don't do that!

26:13.214 --> 26:15.380
Then stop this
and find my dad.

26:15.382 --> 26:17.282
I'm going to.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.953
Okay.
And remember your wife.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.789
Do you know
what you mean to me?

26:23.791 --> 26:25.757
Don't bring my wife
into this!

26:25.759 --> 26:28.794
Have you even
talked to her?

26:28.796 --> 26:30.729
No. Stop asking.

26:30.731 --> 26:32.698
And you think
that's helping anything?

26:32.700 --> 26:34.233
I don't care!

26:34.235 --> 26:36.768
I just care about you.

26:36.770 --> 26:38.904
Hmm.

26:38.906 --> 26:40.772
Well, you should
talk to your -- your wife.

26:40.774 --> 26:43.175
You should probably
go see her.

26:43.177 --> 26:44.543
What do you care?

26:44.545 --> 26:46.979
She's a judge.
She may know other judges.

26:46.981 --> 26:50.516
And they could possibly
make things worse for me.

26:50.518 --> 26:52.417
So it's about you.

26:52.419 --> 26:54.620
No, it's about
the both of us.

26:54.622 --> 26:59.992
��

26:59.994 --> 27:05.063
��

27:05.065 --> 27:07.032
I knew you loved me.

27:07.034 --> 27:08.367
Hmm.

27:08.369 --> 27:09.535
Love you.

27:09.537 --> 27:11.036
Yeah.

27:11.038 --> 27:14.239
Hmm.

27:14.241 --> 27:17.242
So, you don't love me?

27:17.244 --> 27:19.745
I barely know you.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.582
You know me very well.

27:27.988 --> 27:32.524
Would you just stop this,
please, and help me find my dad?

27:32.526 --> 27:35.460
Jeffery,
you not loving me

27:35.462 --> 27:39.731
would mean that I did
all of this in vain,

27:39.733 --> 27:42.434
that I did everything
for nothing,

27:42.436 --> 27:44.803
and that would be...

27:48.642 --> 27:50.943
Tell me you love me.

27:50.945 --> 27:54.112
Okay.
I love you.

27:54.114 --> 27:56.615
I knew it.

27:56.617 --> 27:59.851
Yeah, but I need you
to help me find my dad.

27:59.853 --> 28:02.854
I will.

28:02.856 --> 28:05.557
All right,
take me back to my...

28:05.559 --> 28:08.727
Cell.

28:08.729 --> 28:12.030
Not yet.

28:12.032 --> 28:14.166
No, I need to get back.

28:14.168 --> 28:16.702
Not yet.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.939
Come on, Justin.

28:20.941 --> 28:22.140
Not yet.

28:22.142 --> 28:30.248
��

28:33.387 --> 28:34.386
hey.

28:34.388 --> 28:36.188
Hi.

28:36.190 --> 28:38.457
What's going on?

28:38.459 --> 28:40.425
I can't get this
stupid thing to work.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.327
Here.
Let me take a look at it.

28:42.329 --> 28:47.799
��

28:47.801 --> 28:49.001
thank you.

28:49.003 --> 28:51.803
Sure.

28:51.805 --> 28:54.873
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

28:54.875 --> 28:57.509
Well,
i feel the same, sir.

28:57.511 --> 28:59.311
Yeah, right.

28:59.313 --> 29:01.546
No, I do.

29:01.548 --> 29:03.015
This is just a job
for you, Landon.

29:03.017 --> 29:04.182
Come on.

29:04.184 --> 29:05.417
Is that what you think?

29:05.419 --> 29:07.419
That's what I know.

29:07.421 --> 29:09.521
No, sir, you don't.

29:09.523 --> 29:12.190
I'm never really
wrong about people.

29:12.192 --> 29:14.960
Well, all due respect, sir,
you're wrong about this.

29:17.431 --> 29:20.399
What is this to you?
Why do you do this?

29:20.401 --> 29:21.900
I love my job.

29:21.902 --> 29:23.869
See?

29:23.871 --> 29:26.872
But I also love
working for you.

29:26.874 --> 29:30.809
But still.
You love your job.

29:30.811 --> 29:34.579
It is my job,
but it is also my pleasure.

29:34.581 --> 29:38.083
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

29:38.085 --> 29:40.919
Sir, there's a lot
to admire about you.

29:40.921 --> 29:42.220
I really admire
and respect you.

29:42.222 --> 29:45.457
-Get out of here.
-I do. Really.

29:45.459 --> 29:47.626
Landon, you've been
in politics a long time.

29:47.628 --> 29:49.361
You've met
a lot of people.

29:49.363 --> 29:50.962
None like you.

29:50.964 --> 29:53.165
What does that mean?

29:53.167 --> 29:58.837
You're real and decent
and honest.

29:58.839 --> 30:03.475
You have a true passion
for this and for people.

30:03.477 --> 30:06.278
There's a lot to admire
about you, sir.

30:06.280 --> 30:09.047
Thank you.

30:09.049 --> 30:10.449
Sure.

30:12.219 --> 30:13.985
How's it looking?

30:13.987 --> 30:17.022
Um, the problem is
the top-secret clearance.

30:17.024 --> 30:19.357
It's causing a lot of
your other apps not to work.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.060
And you do know you're gonna
have to get rid of this, right?

30:22.062 --> 30:23.829
It's for my kids.

30:23.831 --> 30:25.097
I'll talk to them.

30:27.735 --> 30:29.935
-Thank you.
-Sure.

30:29.937 --> 30:31.436
I'll see you
in the morning.

30:34.007 --> 30:35.140
What is it?

30:35.142 --> 30:36.708
May I ask?

30:36.710 --> 30:38.944
Go on.

30:38.946 --> 30:40.345
What are you doing
tonight?

30:42.983 --> 30:46.485
Watching cable news
until I fall asleep.

30:46.487 --> 30:48.887
Well, you have
a late start tomorrow.

30:48.889 --> 30:50.989
Do you want
to get a drink?

30:50.991 --> 30:52.991
That's not a bad idea.

30:52.993 --> 30:54.226
Good.

30:54.228 --> 30:58.630
But as Landon my friend,
not as my employee.

30:58.632 --> 31:03.535
Okay, and tonight you
are Charles, my friend.

31:03.537 --> 31:06.505
-Let's pour.
-Shots.

31:06.507 --> 31:08.306
Oh,
you're trying to go hard.

31:08.308 --> 31:11.209
Yes, sir, I am.

31:11.211 --> 31:13.612
Okay.
See you tonight.

31:13.614 --> 31:17.849
��

31:26.944 --> 31:34.349
��

31:34.351 --> 31:41.790
��

31:44.995 --> 31:49.364
- Oh.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.233
Well,
there's your phone again.

31:51.235 --> 31:53.568
And here I am
ignoring it again.

31:53.570 --> 31:55.704
Mm. Good man.

31:57.508 --> 32:00.742
Oh, now it's your turn.

32:00.744 --> 32:04.746
Well, here I am
ignoring it, too.

32:04.748 --> 32:06.715
Good woman.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.283
You know, I love this.

32:08.285 --> 32:09.885
-Yeah.
-Just the two of us.

32:09.887 --> 32:11.319
It's really nice.

32:11.321 --> 32:13.321
Yes.

32:17.094 --> 32:18.793
Get it.

32:18.795 --> 32:21.530
No, i-i won't.

32:21.532 --> 32:22.898
Think it's your ex?

32:22.900 --> 32:24.799
No. There's no way.

32:24.801 --> 32:28.303
Why? Has he called?

32:28.305 --> 32:30.639
No,
i blocked all his numbers.

32:30.641 --> 32:33.174
Oh. Okay.

32:35.178 --> 32:37.479
So...

32:37.481 --> 32:39.314
Hmm?

32:39.316 --> 32:41.449
What?

32:41.451 --> 32:44.286
Um, it's my sister.

32:44.288 --> 32:46.354
I-i actually really
should get this.

32:46.356 --> 32:48.423
Oh, fine. Go ahead.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.225
Okay. Call her.

32:50.227 --> 32:55.230
��

32:55.232 --> 32:56.865
-hello?
-Hello?

32:56.867 --> 32:59.067
You got one more time
to ignore my call.

32:59.069 --> 33:02.871
I'm sorry. We were just having
a nice, quiet dinner.

33:02.873 --> 33:05.540
-So he can hear you.
-Mm-hmm.

33:05.542 --> 33:07.475
That's right.

33:07.477 --> 33:09.277
You better be damn good.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.146
I want to get this bastard.

33:11.148 --> 33:13.415
Yeah, me -- me, too.

33:13.417 --> 33:16.051
Or your ass will be dead.

33:16.053 --> 33:18.620
Come on, it doesn't have
to be like that, right?

33:18.622 --> 33:21.723
Girl, you know me.

33:21.725 --> 33:22.958
Yeah, you're right.
I know. I do.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.127
And I'm sorry.
Okay, I really am.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.830
How -- how can I show it,
make it up to you?

33:30.968 --> 33:34.469
I need 100 grand.

33:34.471 --> 33:37.038
How can i
make that happen?

33:37.040 --> 33:39.541
Back to the start.

33:39.543 --> 33:43.178
Okay, well...

33:43.180 --> 33:45.513
