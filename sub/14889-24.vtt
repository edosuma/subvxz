Oh, I don’t know.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.040

on this story would be

to get a picture of Uncle Shaggy
without his makeup.

And Ears.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.883

the picture.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.152
Why not?

09:12.185 --> 09:14.154
Well, it seems
Uncle Shaggy is, uh

09:14.187 --> 09:16.957
a little camera shy
especially around reporters.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.893
Well, true geniuses often are.

If only there was someone
who wasn’t a reporter.

Someone who’s a big fan of his.

09:27.634 --> 09:28.869
Someone who could get a picture

09:28.902 --> 09:30.136
of Uncle Shaggy
without his makeup.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.105
Ooh, what a story
that would be.

09:35.108 --> 09:38.244
Right up there with the tearing
down of the Berlin Wall.

09:39.946 --> 09:42.616
Well, I guess we’ll just have to
do without a picture. Too bad.

09:42.649 --> 09:47.153
Wait a minute, are you saying
that if you were to hang around

09:47.187 --> 09:49.155
Uncle Shaggy after the
interview, distract him

09:49.189 --> 09:51.658
with some idle fan chatter,
and then at the right moment...

09:51.692 --> 09:52.993
And this is the important part,
Uncle Shaggy

09:53.026 --> 09:54.260
must not know
what you are doing.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.130
...you could snap the picture?
Is that what you’re saying?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.302
I must have blacked out.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.743
I‐I didn’t hear me say that.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.613
Well, Balki,
that is a great idea.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.915
Well, thank you very much.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.151
I‐I...
I‐I do try.

10:18.184 --> 10:21.287

Too bad it wouldn’t work.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.289
‐Why? Why not?
‐Well, it just wouldn’t work.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.727
But‐but you just said
it was a great idea.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.262
You have plenty of great ideas
that don’t work.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.797
Why I can’t have one?

10:32.165 --> 10:33.800
Well, Balki, you can’t
take the picture.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.902
‐You’re not a real reporter.
‐Well, I...

10:35.936 --> 10:36.903
‐Let me take the picture.
‐No.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.905
‐I want to take the picture.
‐I know you do.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.140
‐I want to take the picture.
‐No, no.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.409
‐Please. Please!
‐No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Well, okay.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.781

10:47.814 --> 10:50.183
But only because
it means so much to you.

to thank me.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.518

about the makeup thing

This is great publicity for you.

because of this picture?

12:29.482 --> 12:30.951
I, uh, alright.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.485
It’s‐it’s a little out of focus

12:32.519 --> 12:34.888
and the lighting’s dim but...

12:34.921 --> 12:36.422
...that’s not your fault.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.458
I got fired because
somebody recognized me

12:38.491 --> 12:40.794
from this picture
and called the station.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.095
Well, why would they fire you?

12:42.128 --> 12:45.098
[sighs]
I have a prison record.

12:45.131 --> 12:47.333
Don’t tell me.
"Jailhouse Rock?"

12:50.270 --> 12:51.337
I love that record.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.907
Balki, Balki,
a prison record

12:53.940 --> 12:55.475
doesn’t mean a recording.

12:55.509 --> 12:57.811
It means he was in prison.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.116
Why you were in prison?

13:03.149 --> 13:06.386
Twenty years ago, I got
into some financial trouble.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.055
I tried to get out of it
by writing bad checks.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.290
I thought my past was behind me

13:10.323 --> 13:12.893
and it was
until you printed this picture.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.528
Well, well, they can’t
fire you for something

13:14.561 --> 13:16.062
you did 20 years ago.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.330
Tell that to the producer.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.934
She says parents don’t want
their kids watching an ex‐con.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.336
So tomorrow’s my last day
in the "Dog House."

13:23.369 --> 13:25.972
Why did you do this? I told you
I didn’t want my picture taken.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.943
‐Cousin, he told you that?
‐I‐I’m sorry.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.377
This‐this is all my fault.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.615
I‐I didn’t know that’s why you
didn’t want your picture taken.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.249
I thought I could trust you.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.085
I guess I was wrong.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.930
Cousin, we‐we can’t let them
do that to Uncle Shaggy.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.833
I feel terrible but there’s
nothing we can do about it.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.602
Yes, yes, there is.

13:55.636 --> 13:58.204
We‐we can go right down
to that TV studio

13:58.238 --> 14:00.206
and talk to Uncle Shaggy’s
producer.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.009
And if she thinks
she’s going to fire Uncle Shaggy

14:03.043 --> 14:05.111
she’ll have to do it
over my dumb body.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.924
Cousin, there she is.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.159
There’s the producer.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.961
Now we have to go talk to her.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.397
We have to go tell her, "No way
can she fire Uncle Shaggy."

14:24.430 --> 14:26.933
Balki, now I know
this means a lot to you.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.468
I know you’re upset.

14:28.502 --> 14:31.104
But remember,
you have to stay calm.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.209
Well, of course, I will.
Don’t be ridiculous.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.618
Please don’t fire Uncle Shaggy!
Please, please, please, please!

14:44.651 --> 14:48.088
Why is this person
wrapped around my feet?

14:48.121 --> 14:51.057
Uh, I’m Larry Appleton
from the "Chicago Chronicle"

14:51.091 --> 14:53.159
and, uh, this is
Balki Bartokomous.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.699
Uh, we came down to talk
about Uncle Shaggy.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.434
We really don’t think
you should take him off the air.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.604
I’m not taking Uncle Shaggy
off the air.

15:04.605 --> 15:05.639
Well, that was easy.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.009
Maybe we should try
to get him a raise.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.512
The Uncle Shaggy show stays.

15:11.545 --> 15:14.180
I’m just getting
a different actor to play him.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.683
We’d like to see the old
Uncle Shaggy keep his job.

15:16.717 --> 15:19.586
Are you crazy?
He’s a convicted felon!

15:19.620 --> 15:22.322
I don’t want any controversy.
I’m replacing him.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.724
But you cannot!

15:23.757 --> 15:27.060
You cannot replace Uncle Shaggy
just like that.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.330
Uncle Shaggy is more than
just a pair of floppy ears.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.198
More than a set of whiskers.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.499
More than a press‐on nose.

15:33.534 --> 15:35.201
‐More than a tail!
‐Ah!

15:35.235 --> 15:36.436
Balki.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.604
[clears throat]

15:37.638 --> 15:39.439
What my friend is
trying to say

15:39.472 --> 15:41.474
is that Uncle Shaggy
has a special place

15:41.508 --> 15:43.677
in the hearts of his fans.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.647
They’re kids!
They’ll get over it.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.948
Excuse me.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.156
[sighs]

15:56.189 --> 15:58.324
Cousin, what are we going to do?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.426
Well, we still have the power
of the press behind us.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.003
I’m gonna write an article
exposing this whole thing.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.272
No, cousin, we don’t have time
to wait for an article.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.007
We have do something today.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.108
Well, Balki,
what are we gonna do?

16:15.141 --> 16:16.409
Go on TV and tell the kids

16:16.442 --> 16:18.178
that Uncle Shaggy
has been eighty‐sixed?

16:18.211 --> 16:20.013
I don’t think
his age is the issue.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.686
But we could go on TV
and tell the kids

16:25.719 --> 16:28.054
that Uncle Shaggy
has been fired.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.723
Balki, we can’t do that.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.467
We could if we were dogs.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.705
‐Oh, no. No, no.
‐Oh!

16:55.115 --> 16:56.116
Psst!

17:09.329 --> 17:11.196
I don’t believe this.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.333
First, I have to interview
a man in a dog suit.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.769
Now I am a man in a dog suit.

17:15.801 --> 17:20.240
(male #1)
’We’re back in five
four, three, two...’

17:20.272 --> 17:22.407
Welcome back,
puppies and hounds.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.477
Wasn’t that some great cartoon?

17:24.511 --> 17:26.046
[laughing]

17:27.313 --> 17:28.414
[howling in distance]

17:28.448 --> 17:29.616
Oh‐oh.

17:29.650 --> 17:31.552
I think I hear
Frenchie and Hot Dog.

17:34.688 --> 17:36.657
[imitates dog howling]

17:36.690 --> 17:38.625
[instrumental music]

18:14.728 --> 18:16.663
Woof, woof, woof.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.301
Well, boys and girls

18:21.334 --> 18:23.904
it looks like
Frenchie and Hot Dog

18:23.937 --> 18:26.372
are not themselves today.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.710
So I think Uncle Shaggy’s
gonna have to run to the park...

18:30.844 --> 18:32.646
...alone.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.648
[instrumental music]

18:43.690 --> 18:46.259
Didn’t you hear me,
Frenchie and Hot Dog?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.529
I said I’m going
to the park alone.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.263
But, Uncle Shaggy...
Whoa!

18:50.296 --> 18:51.397
Whoa!

18:52.966 --> 18:54.768
Time for a commercial,
boys and girls.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.303
Let’s hear from Water Wonder
Backyard Pools.

18:57.337 --> 19:02.208
Remember, kids, Water Wonder
is impervious to mildew and rot.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.076
We’re in the commercial.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.178
[sighs]
What are you two doing here?

19:05.211 --> 19:07.480
‐Haven’t you done enough?
‐Uh, listen, Shaggy.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.782
We’re‐we’re here
because we wanna tell

19:08.815 --> 19:10.684
the kids at home
about what’s going on.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.619
Oh, it’s too late,
you make a mistake

19:12.653 --> 19:14.287
you pay for it
the rest of your life.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.922
No, no, that’s not true.

19:15.956 --> 19:18.191
Come on, Uncle Shaggy,
you‐you have to give the fans

19:18.224 --> 19:19.926
a chance to show
how much they love you.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.328
Look, I’ve got two minutes
of showtime left.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.965
Let me finish it with some
dignity and get out of here.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.834
Shaggy, you’re on
in three, two...

19:27.868 --> 19:30.270
Welcome back,
puppies and hounds.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.673
Frenchie and Hot Dog
were just leaving.

19:32.706 --> 19:33.907
No, no, wait a minute.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.842
Boys and girls,
and any parents out there

19:35.876 --> 19:38.545
I have an important
announcement to make.

19:38.579 --> 19:40.581
Down, Frenchie.
Bad dog.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.384
Boys and girls,
are you listening?

19:44.417 --> 19:45.886
Shaggy, 30 seconds.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.989
A long time ago,
Uncle Shaggy was a bad dog

19:49.022 --> 19:52.392
but now he’s a good dog
and, uh, they want to

19:52.425 --> 19:54.728
to‐to give his nose and ears
to somebody else

19:54.761 --> 19:55.929
but we cannot let
that happen because‐‐

19:55.962 --> 19:57.831
‐Twenty seconds.
‐Because Uncle Shaggy is‐‐

19:57.864 --> 19:58.932
Balki, we’re running
out of time.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.534
Uncle Shaggy...
Ow!

20:00.567 --> 20:02.803
Listen, kids
and any parents out there.

20:02.836 --> 20:05.672
A long time ago,
Uncle Shaggy went to jail

20:05.706 --> 20:07.941
because of something
that he is very sorry he did.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.410
But that’s behind him now
and he’s changed his life.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.012
But now his boss
want to fire him.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.414
‐So if you love Uncle Shaggy‐‐
‐And we know you do.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.816
...then call this station
right now

20:15.849 --> 20:17.818
and tell them
that you want him to stay.

20:17.851 --> 20:19.385
And we’re off the air.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.821
‐We’re off the air?
‐Yeah.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.259
Thanks, guys.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.494
Now everyone in the world
knows I’m an ex‐con.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.944
Balki, you’ve barely
touched your food.

20:43.977 --> 20:46.346
I’ve never seen you turn up
your nose at pig snout.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.785
I just, the thought of never
seeing Uncle Shaggy on TV again

20:51.818 --> 20:54.020
has made me lose my appetizers.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.826
Well, Balki, we did
everything we could.

20:59.860 --> 21:03.564
We put on dog suits. We sat up
and begged on television.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.033
It just didn’t work.

21:08.068 --> 21:09.302
[knock on door]

21:18.011 --> 21:20.380
‐Uncle Shaggy?
‐Hi, Larry.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.717
‐Hi, Balki.
‐Hi, Uncle Shaggy.

21:26.587 --> 21:28.488
They gave me my job back!

21:28.522 --> 21:29.590
Oh!

21:37.698 --> 21:38.665
What happened?

21:38.699 --> 21:40.534
Well, thanks to you,
the station was flooded

21:40.567 --> 21:42.669
with hundreds of calls,
telegrams.

21:42.703 --> 21:44.738
Kids showed up
with picket signs.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.407
It seems you were right.
I have lots of fans out there.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.476
Well, we tried to tell you that
but you wouldn’t listen.

21:50.511 --> 21:52.045
Thanks a lot, guys.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.814
Hey, why you don’t stay

21:53.847 --> 21:56.550
and we’ll celebrate
with some pig snout?

21:56.583 --> 21:59.452
Uh, tempting
but I gotta go.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.588
I gotta go to the dry cleaners
and pick up my ears.

22:01.622 --> 22:03.423
Oh!

22:03.456 --> 22:05.091
I really wanna thank you
for what you did.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.561
You saved my tail.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.596
Well, it’s the least
we could do.

22:09.630 --> 22:11.064
Oh!

22:11.097 --> 22:14.467
I thought you might like these.

22:17.871 --> 22:18.939
Swell.

22:20.741 --> 22:22.743
My own dog nose?

22:26.980 --> 22:28.682
[sobbing]
I love this country.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.697
[theme music]
