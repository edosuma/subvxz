AFFAIRS OF THE HEART

00:06.481 --> 00:08.566
Excuse me, cutie.

00:10.317 --> 00:13.736
Cutie?
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:14.821 --> 00:17.823
- Her.
- Better be.

00:17.989 --> 00:21.909
- As long as you're here.
- I ain't here.

00:22.076 --> 00:27.789
What's the matter? Did we get up on the
the wrong side of the web this morning?

00:28.872 --> 00:33.126
- I hate it when they call me cutie.
- I know how you feeI.

00:33.292 --> 00:37.546
Earlier, a customer had the effrontery
to refer to me as "honey".

00:37.712 --> 00:41.173
But that makes sense.
Honey is bee barf.

00:48.011 --> 00:52.306
- Did that snort mean we were amused?
- No, definitely not.

00:52.473 --> 00:55.268
That was a snort of disapprovaI.

02:06.987 --> 02:09.155
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

02:10.156 --> 02:13.658
- How's life, Norm?
- Ask a man who's got one.

02:15.619 --> 02:19.163
- Here's mine now.
- About that, Norm.

02:19.330 --> 02:22.498
- He raised the prices.
- I was going to say.

02:22.665 --> 02:26.043
You would have found a way
to cushion the blow.

02:26.209 --> 02:30.212
Sure, Sam. Why not?
It's Get Norm Year. Join the fun.

02:30.379 --> 02:35.633
- Come on. It's only a quarter.
- Only a quarter? Easy for you to say.

02:35.799 --> 02:40.470
- Maybe this will change your tune.
- He's going for his gun.

02:40.637 --> 02:43.263
It's my calculator, Coach.

02:43.430 --> 02:48.893
I'll figure out how much I can drink
and still stay within my suds allowance.

02:51.436 --> 02:56.607
- What have you got?
- I'm going to have to cut back 8.7%.

02:56.774 --> 03:00.318
Comes out to one beer every half hour.

03:02.653 --> 03:06.198
I'm going to have to drink
a little more slowly.

03:11.451 --> 03:13.828
Slowing down isn't so bad.

03:14.995 --> 03:19.540
Sam, you've got one of the cutest
waitresses I've ever seen.

03:19.707 --> 03:22.459
Oh, stop. I'm blushing.

03:22.626 --> 03:25.128
I meant you.

03:25.295 --> 03:27.838
- So what?
- Sorry.

03:28.005 --> 03:30.048
You sure are.

03:31.925 --> 03:34.176
Romance is in the air, Sam.

03:35.594 --> 03:39.347
- Well, I'm a little busy, but I suppose...
- Oh, Sam!

03:42.974 --> 03:47.103
If you could see past your codpiece...

03:49.104 --> 03:53.482
...you'd notice I was referring
to that gentleman there.

03:53.649 --> 03:56.359
He's been watching Carla all week.

03:56.526 --> 04:01.363
Haven't you seen him give her
those looks? It's embarrassing.

04:01.530 --> 04:05.616
If he were any more overcome with
desire, there'd be drooI on his chin.

04:05.783 --> 04:09.953
Excuse me. What were you saying?

04:10.120 --> 04:15.623
For whatever reason, he's attracted
to Carla, but he can't get started.

04:15.790 --> 04:18.543
- I should help him.
- You shouldn't.

04:18.709 --> 04:20.877
We'll compromise. I'll help him.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.462
I knew we could work this out.

04:29.259 --> 04:34.263
- Excuse me. I'm Diane Chambers.
- Hello. Henry Zenzola.

04:34.430 --> 04:37.932
- Nice to meet you. Mind if I sit down?
- No, please.

04:39.015 --> 04:44.478
Henry, I'll put it right on the line.
How do you feeI about Carla?

04:44.645 --> 04:49.023
The waitress with the fouI mouth
and nasty disposition?

04:49.190 --> 04:52.818
- That's her.
- She's the hottest thing walking.

04:52.985 --> 04:56.571
Do you want to get to know her?
I can arrange it.

04:56.737 --> 05:01.158
You think so? I've tried all week.
She acts like I'm contagious.

05:01.324 --> 05:05.119
Has she actually made
any retching noises?

05:06.536 --> 05:09.872
You're in. I'll be right back.

05:11.582 --> 05:14.750
What a nice person.
Is she always like that?

05:14.917 --> 05:17.127
Yeah. Coach, give me a beer.

05:18.378 --> 05:22.631
You're ahead
of your one-beer-a-half-hour schedule.

05:22.798 --> 05:26.509
No, I'm on London time.
God save the Queen.

05:28.178 --> 05:33.681
His name is Henry. He's interested
in you. I think you should talk to him.

05:33.848 --> 05:39.311
I don't. If he's interested in me,
there's something wrong with him.

05:39.477 --> 05:44.731
Carla, I assure you he's charming.
I think he's attractive. Don't you?

05:44.898 --> 05:47.191
As cue balls go, he's a looker.

05:48.525 --> 05:53.529
For some reason, guys I'm interested in,
or guys interested in me,

05:53.696 --> 05:57.657
always have something
seriously wrong with them.

05:57.824 --> 06:02.244
Carla, I can see that,
but stop feeling you're undesirable.

06:02.411 --> 06:06.080
Are you kidding? I'm too desirable.

06:07.372 --> 06:10.625
I'm a vermin magnet.

06:13.669 --> 06:20.299
Come on, Carla. This guy's not like that.
He's attractive, charming, intelligent

06:20.466 --> 06:23.259
and opposites attract, so go for him.

06:23.426 --> 06:28.430
He's always talking there about the Sox.
He knows Yaz personally.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.681
- Yaz?
- Yaz.

06:33.725 --> 06:36.436
- OK, I'll talk to him.
- Oh, goody.

06:37.895 --> 06:42.523
Just long enough to find out
what's wrong with this loser.

06:42.690 --> 06:45.151
I like a person with an open mind.

06:47.903 --> 06:50.946
- You're Hank?
- Yeah. How do you do.

06:51.113 --> 06:54.574
Shut up and answer a few questions.

06:55.825 --> 07:00.079
Where'd you come from?
We never saw you here before.

07:00.245 --> 07:04.165
- I don't really get out that much.
- He's married.

07:04.332 --> 07:06.583
No. I'm single.

07:08.709 --> 07:10.920
- Ever been married?
- No.

07:11.087 --> 07:14.589
Gay as a goose.

07:16.507 --> 07:20.051
- What?
- I like women. Some women very much.

07:20.218 --> 07:22.678
Hooker bait.

07:23.970 --> 07:29.600
I don't mind being put through my paces.
I'm always one to enjoy a good game.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.810
I hope this one gets better.

07:36.980 --> 07:41.818
- This proves nothing.
- He is great and it's killing you.

07:41.984 --> 07:45.237
I admit he is tough, but I'll crack him.

07:47.363 --> 07:52.075
We're going for a cup of coffee on you.
Sam, I'm taking a break.

07:52.242 --> 07:56.870
You got a criminaI record?
Any mentaI illness in the family?

07:57.037 --> 07:59.080
OK, open your mouth.

08:03.041 --> 08:06.168
Who's the world's greatest matchmaker?

08:07.044 --> 08:09.630
- Say it.
- I'm not going to say it.

08:09.796 --> 08:14.842
Admit Carla and Hank have been an item
since they went out to dinner.

08:15.008 --> 08:17.261
I hate to see that.

08:17.426 --> 08:20.221
You think Carla's making a mistake?

08:20.388 --> 08:24.349
No. I just had my last beer
of the 20th Century.

08:28.519 --> 08:35.065
Hey, everybody. We came from
the game. We killed the Oilers 28 to 3.

08:36.607 --> 08:38.860
Hank has great season seats.

08:39.025 --> 08:42.736
Spitting distance
from the visitors' bench.

08:44.572 --> 08:47.825
Listen, Hank, thanks a lot.
I had a great time.

08:49.325 --> 08:53.245
I did, too.
Do you want to meet for a light supper?

08:53.412 --> 08:58.666
I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you before.
We're through. Beat it.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.757
- What did you find wrong with him?
- Nothing.

09:09.924 --> 09:15.678
I do not want to talk about it. Sam,
what do you need from your office?

09:15.845 --> 09:18.639
- Nothing.
- I'll see if you have any.

09:28.344 --> 09:32.722
- What happened?
- I don't know. We got along so great.

09:34.181 --> 09:37.267
Hank, sit down. Coach, pour him a beer.

09:37.434 --> 09:41.103
I'll see if Carla needs help
finding that nothing.

09:42.437 --> 09:47.649
Hey, Hank, you know,
when I'm really kind of depressed,

09:47.816 --> 09:53.987
I usually like to buy a beer for a friend
who's a little behind on his beer budget.

09:54.154 --> 09:58.532
Well, I'm not really feeling
all that depressed.

09:58.699 --> 10:05.496
You're not? You fall hard for a girI, you
think you've got her where you want her

10:05.662 --> 10:09.165
and she cuts you off
at the kneecaps in front...

10:09.332 --> 10:13.126
- Set them up.
- Thank you. This'll help.

10:15.087 --> 10:18.339
- I want to be alone.
- I'll only be a second.

10:18.506 --> 10:24.052
I've got something important to do.
I have to fix the... immediately.

10:38.687 --> 10:40.730
OK. All right.

10:40.897 --> 10:46.610
- What are you doing here, Sam?
- I wanted to see if you wanted to talk.

10:46.777 --> 10:48.945
I don't.

10:52.489 --> 10:55.950
Sam, this guy is perfect
in every other way.

10:56.116 --> 11:02.413
The only thing left is that he must be
lousy in bed. Who needs it?

11:02.579 --> 11:08.292
You know, from over here, it seems
like you're just afraid to go with this.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.586
- Being vulnerable.
- Vulnerable?

11:11.753 --> 11:15.005
It's just a word I picked up somewhere.

11:18.716 --> 11:25.514
I'm scared he's going to be so crazed
with desire, I'll never get rid of him.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.225
That's not it.
You're afraid you're going to fall for him.

11:30.392 --> 11:35.354
No, I'm not going to fall for him.
I've already fallen for him.

11:37.355 --> 11:40.316
You're afraid he'll turn into a jerk?

11:40.483 --> 11:44.528
- No, smart guy. He's already a jerk.
- Why's he a jerk?

11:44.695 --> 11:48.322
- Because he's dishonest.
- Why is he dishonest?

11:48.489 --> 11:52.200
Because he's hiding the fact
that he's a jerk.

11:53.492 --> 11:57.453
Who's jerking who here?
You always say you're tough.

11:57.620 --> 12:03.041
You act tough. You're not tough. Tough
guys take chances. You're chicken.

12:03.208 --> 12:08.003
- Don't ever call me that.
- That's what you are. You're chicken.

12:08.837 --> 12:14.300
Hey! I want to go with you. You have
been cruising on your looks for too long.

12:14.466 --> 12:17.468
- I'm not going to fight you.
- Let's go!

12:20.012 --> 12:22.431
Come on. You're half my size.

12:23.514 --> 12:25.558
That's dirty!

12:29.269 --> 12:34.398
Nobody calls me chicken. I'm going
to go out there and be vulnerable.

12:34.565 --> 12:40.569
I'm going to go open myself to happiness
like a banshee. Can I have the night off?

12:40.736 --> 12:43.279
Thanks.

12:45.823 --> 12:48.783
FeeI better now? Yeah, I thought so.

12:59.041 --> 13:01.751
- Want to go to my place?
- You bet.

13:01.917 --> 13:05.420
We can't. My kids are there.
Your place?

13:05.587 --> 13:09.840
I'm staying with a friend
untiI my apartment's ready.

13:10.966 --> 13:14.177
Diane, give me the keys to your place.

13:14.344 --> 13:18.180
- I will not.
- You're the matchmaker.

13:18.346 --> 13:24.351
You want this thing to work out or end up
with a broken heart? And a broken lip?

13:29.605 --> 13:34.400
Enjoy. And, Carla, when you're done,
just burn the place.

13:37.903 --> 13:39.946
Come on.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.865
You made me
the happiest man on earth.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.367
Just wait.

13:53.498 --> 13:56.124
- Are you all right?
- Don't worry.

13:56.291 --> 13:58.835
She didn't hurt the good stuff.

14:03.671 --> 14:07.091
Romance in this bar
is kind of an inspiration.

14:07.257 --> 14:11.093
You, Diane, Carla, Hank there.

14:11.260 --> 14:16.890
Seeing you makes me think somewhere
out there there's somebody for me.

14:20.226 --> 14:23.144
There are those that would disagree.

14:23.311 --> 14:28.273
I'm sorry, Cliff. Just a picture
came to mind of you in the sack.

14:30.817 --> 14:36.822
I see your mailbag draped over a chair,
next to your gabardines.

14:36.988 --> 14:39.782
That's as far as I wanted to look.

14:39.949 --> 14:44.786
Wait a minute. I agree with Cliff.
Cheers is a romantic bar.

14:44.953 --> 14:50.122
Take a poor guy like Hank with
his terrible problem. He can get a girI.

14:53.083 --> 14:58.712
- Coach, what terrible problem?
- I can't talk about it. Hank said not to.

14:58.879 --> 15:03.967
Coach, this could be important.
Can you give us a hint or something?

15:04.133 --> 15:09.845
A hint? OK, I got one. Lefty Cramer.

15:11.681 --> 15:13.890
The old third baseman?

15:14.057 --> 15:19.270
Right. Lefty has the same problem
that Hank has.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.147
Hank can't hit a breaking pitch?

15:25.440 --> 15:28.901
- Oh, yeah, poor Carla.
- She'll be crushed.

15:29.068 --> 15:33.947
Come on. Keep thinking. Think.
What problem did Lefty have?

15:34.114 --> 15:38.117
Well, he was ugly as a mud fence.
I remember that.

15:38.284 --> 15:42.995
He was a bad dresser.
He used to spit tobacco juice all over.

15:44.079 --> 15:46.623
Could we forget Lefty?

15:48.207 --> 15:50.459
What's wrong with Hank?

15:50.625 --> 15:55.671
Wait a minute. I got it.
Coach, Lefty had a heart problem.

15:55.838 --> 16:01.259
Hank has the same thing.
The least bit of excitement, it's curtains.

16:01.426 --> 16:06.762
- Coach, how about sex?
- Diane, I thought you were Sam's girI.

16:12.517 --> 16:14.768
I'm talking about Hank.

16:14.935 --> 16:18.646
Hank is seeing Carla.
Are you listening to this?

16:18.813 --> 16:24.359
Coach, she's trying to say,
is Hank in any danger with Carla tonight?

16:24.526 --> 16:29.237
Not at all. Not unless
he gets overexcited about something.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.574
Sam, we've got to stop them.

16:32.741 --> 16:37.493
Hank wouldn't have gone with Carla
if he thought it was risky.

16:38.578 --> 16:42.289
- We've got to stop them.
- We've got to warn Carla.

16:42.456 --> 16:46.625
What a shock if the guy
drops dead in Carla's own bed.

16:46.792 --> 16:50.545
- Oh, God. She's in my apartment.
- You're kidding.

16:50.712 --> 16:56.966
That's the last time I let somebody
have a great time in my bedroom. Call.

16:57.133 --> 17:01.720
- Just call.
- What am I supposed to say?

17:01.887 --> 17:06.640
Tell her to look on the next pillow
and count the dead people.

17:06.807 --> 17:11.226
Norman.
Just ask her if everything's all right.

17:11.393 --> 17:14.396
All right. The line's busy.

17:14.563 --> 17:18.273
Then maybe she's calling an ambulance.

17:18.441 --> 17:22.027
Stop it.
We don't have to jump to conclusions.

17:22.194 --> 17:29.240
A lot of people take the phone off the
hook so it won't interrupt their intimacies.

17:29.407 --> 17:34.619
- How come we never did that?
- I might miss an important call.

17:36.245 --> 17:40.957
- Go and see what's happening.
- You're right. Stay on the line.

17:41.124 --> 17:45.586
- It's my fault. I pushed them into this.
- I'm going, too.

17:45.752 --> 17:50.380
- I'll go with you. I know CPR.
- I'll go. I'm a CPA.

17:50.547 --> 17:54.926
Stay here. I can handle this.
If we need you, I'll call you.

17:55.092 --> 17:57.803
Please, God, let Hank be all right.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.432
- Stop!
- Oh, no...

18:03.599 --> 18:08.852
- I wonder if we're too late.
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

18:09.019 --> 18:13.731
No, Sam. We can't just burst in on them.
That's a gaucherie.

18:15.066 --> 18:18.652
Besides, we might actually see them.

18:19.820 --> 18:22.238
What were we planning to do?

18:23.322 --> 18:27.367
Let's make loud noises
to draw their attention.

18:29.159 --> 18:32.620
- Fire!
- No, Sam. You'll startle him.

18:32.787 --> 18:35.206
My God. I hope I didn't blow it.

18:35.373 --> 18:38.083
Sam, that's so disgusting.

18:39.542 --> 18:43.419
- Can you hear anything?
- Not a thing.

18:43.586 --> 18:47.339
I thought Carla would be
the type to make noises.

18:53.886 --> 18:57.222
- Hello there.
- They're just starting.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.726
What the hell's going on here?

19:08.021 --> 19:10.439
We thought you were in there.

19:10.606 --> 19:12.984
Were you looking for pointers?

19:14.109 --> 19:18.570
- We saw wine glasses...
- We had a drink and went out to eat.

19:18.737 --> 19:24.367
- So you didn't actually...
- Let's pretend it's any of your business.

19:26.535 --> 19:30.162
- No, we didn't.
- Why are you here? What's wrong?

19:32.957 --> 19:39.295
Hank, I'm sorry for intruding, but Coach
said you had a heart condition.

19:42.088 --> 19:44.716
- Did he?
- Did he make a mistake?

19:44.881 --> 19:48.926
- He's right. I have a serious problem.
- You do?

19:49.093 --> 19:54.180
He also said that any exertion
would be very dangerous for you.

19:54.347 --> 19:58.309
We thought we'd catch you
before you and Carla...

19:58.475 --> 20:01.185
Exerted.

20:01.352 --> 20:03.396
Wait a minute.

20:04.479 --> 20:08.190
Are you trying to tell me
you could have died?

20:09.275 --> 20:11.652
Yeah. It could have happened.

20:11.818 --> 20:16.822
Sex is OK for most people with
heart problems. For me, it's chancy.

20:18.532 --> 20:21.784
- If we didn't get wild...
- Are you kidding?

20:21.951 --> 20:25.662
I've almost killed off guys
with good pumps.

20:28.914 --> 20:32.500
Would you butt out?
I am not going to forget this.

20:32.667 --> 20:35.961
Of all the rotten things
guys have done to me.

20:36.128 --> 20:39.464
- I was right.
- I didn't want to spoiI it.

20:39.630 --> 20:45.010
SpoiI it? I would have felt great,
waking up tomorrow next to a stiff.

20:45.177 --> 20:49.138
You wouldn't have had
to feed him breakfast.

20:52.891 --> 20:57.352
Hank, why would you take such a risk?

20:57.519 --> 20:59.771
How could I not?

20:59.937 --> 21:06.776
Carla, I've been so carefuI for so long.
Then I met you and I just didn't care.

21:06.942 --> 21:11.654
The more I got to know you,
the more I wanted to take the risk.

21:15.157 --> 21:17.575
You're nuts.

21:17.742 --> 21:22.370
I got so carried away,
I didn't think what it might do to you.

21:22.537 --> 21:25.956
I don't know what to think about all this.

21:26.123 --> 21:28.292
I guess I'd better leave.

21:28.459 --> 21:32.669
Couldn't you just be good friends,
reaI good friends?

21:32.836 --> 21:36.798
No.
I don't want to be just friends with Carla.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.967
It would drive me crazy to not touch you.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.886
Hear that, beanpole?

21:45.804 --> 21:49.599
Carla, I'm sorry I disappointed you.

21:49.766 --> 21:53.477
Wait a minute.
I just thought of something.

21:55.187 --> 21:59.898
In a way, I think maybe
you and I were perfect together.

22:00.982 --> 22:04.693
See, we never had an argument, right?

22:04.860 --> 22:09.280
Not a harsh word.
No one looking in another direction.

22:09.447 --> 22:15.660
Yes. It's like an incredibly delicate
flower. It doesn't matter how long it lasts.

22:15.826 --> 22:19.538
Hey, whitey, this is my moment here.

22:20.455 --> 22:22.498
I'm sorry.

22:22.665 --> 22:29.629
In a way, Hank, I'll always remember you
as the best lover I ever had.

22:45.473 --> 22:47.517
Goodbye.

22:58.775 --> 23:03.862
Well, now I've seen past
your little masquerade

23:04.029 --> 23:08.407
and there's a bond between us
that can never be broken.

23:10.575 --> 23:16.579
I'm going to capture my feelings while
they're fresh and put them in my diary.

23:16.746 --> 23:21.667
Wait, Diane. It's right here.
We were laughing about it at dinner.

24:00.612 --> 24:01.613
English
