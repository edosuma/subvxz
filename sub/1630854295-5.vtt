WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.303
Tonight, Emma Grede,
founder and CEO of

00:03.403 --> 00:05.305
smash-hit apparel brand
Good American

00:05.405 --> 00:08.408
and founding partner of SKIMS,
returns to the Tank.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.578
God, you are speaking
my language 100%.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.180
We want to service
an audience

00:13.280 --> 00:15.282
that has been overlooked
for years.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.683
You're allowed
to make a...

00:16.783 --> 00:19.219
Mess! Mess! Mess!

00:19.319 --> 00:22.322
The Plufl allow you to turn
any place into a napping space.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.691
I was awarded one of
Oprah's Favorite Things.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.893
Are you
making any money?

00:25.993 --> 00:27.394
No, I have lost
a fortune this year.

00:27.494 --> 00:28.462
We have sales of
$2 million.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.496
$2 million?

00:29.596 --> 00:30.597
$2 million.

00:30.697 --> 00:31.965
We put it on TikTok,
and it went viral.

00:32.065 --> 00:34.001
I just don't get it.
Why are people buying these?

00:34.101 --> 00:35.235
Why not?
Oh, I like it.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.503
Please!

00:36.603 --> 00:39.640
It broke my heart, what you
did. I wept like a baby.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.346
Let's go, team!

00:46.446 --> 00:49.116
We're energetic. We're fun.
This is our moment.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.217
Let's go!

00:50.317 --> 00:53.954
Let's go. Let's do it.
I'm so excited.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.355
First in the Tank

00:55.455 --> 00:59.092
is a way to get just as cozy
as the world's best nappers.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.136
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Noah.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.604
And my name is Yuki.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.574
We're recent college grads,
and we're here seeking
$200,000

01:13.674 --> 01:16.043
in exchange for
10% of our company, Plufl.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.812
Sharks, we all have
those long days

01:18.912 --> 01:20.280
when we crave
a cozy nap

01:20.380 --> 01:22.716
to get away from
the troubles of the world.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.052
When you just need a break
from the stress and exhaustion,

01:25.152 --> 01:27.287
you could quite literally
sleep anywhere.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.690
I mean, look at our buddy
Kipper over here.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.992
Sharks, don't you find
yourself jealous of Kipper?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.294
Able to nap literally
wherever he wants.

01:34.394 --> 01:37.030
Don't you ever wish you
could have what Kipper has?

01:37.130 --> 01:38.365
Well, now you can.

01:38.465 --> 01:41.134
Introducing...

01:41.234 --> 01:42.169
Plufl!

01:42.269 --> 01:44.571
It's a dog bed for humans!

01:44.671 --> 01:46.740
That's right, Sharks.
I didn't see
that coming.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.041
Plufl is the world's
first dog bed

01:48.141 --> 01:49.810
specifically designed
for humans.

01:49.910 --> 01:54.348
Because if you work like a
dog, why not sleep like one?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.682
When you sink into
the Plufl,

01:55.782 --> 01:58.118
you're surrounded by the
softest materials and textures.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.786
The soft pillow border
allows you to

01:59.886 --> 02:01.154
tuck your hands
and feet inside

02:01.254 --> 02:05.425
and maximize what we like
to call "the snuggle factor"!

02:05.525 --> 02:06.493
The plush faux fur

02:06.593 --> 02:08.629
and high-grade
orthopedic memory foam

02:08.729 --> 02:11.398
allow you to turn any place
into a napping space.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.603
Doesn't he look cozy?
I wouldn't want to wake him up.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.905
Sharks, we want to bring
this revolutionary

02:19.006 --> 02:20.674
napping experience everywhere.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.209
So don't sleep
on this opportunity

02:22.309 --> 02:26.046
to join us in building
a napping empire.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.782
Alright, so who wants
to try out the Plufl?

02:28.882 --> 02:29.883
I do.
I'll do it.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.585
Yeah,
I want to touch it.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.153
Robert, we figured you would
really want to try it out.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.621
I definitely want
to try it!

02:34.721 --> 02:36.657
Come on, anyone,
give it a go.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.191
Alright.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.726
You're such a Robert. Ohh.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.927
Robert,
would you like a blanket?

02:41.028 --> 02:42.229
Yes, I would
like a blanket.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.430
Mark, here,
lay in this one.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.598
Ahh.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.932
Robert,
try curling up a little bit,

02:46.033 --> 02:47.634
like a little baby.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.237
Shockingly,
it's really comfortable.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.271
Mark,
give it a go.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.306
Ohh.
I wanna see
if I can fit.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.342
Pull right up.
You can put your legs out.

02:55.442 --> 02:56.677
Yeah, kind of lean
your arms on it.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.278
Kind of relax.
Lounge a little bit, yeah.

02:58.378 --> 03:00.147
It's actually not bad.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.248
It's not bad.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.716
Oh, yeah, Robert.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.318
Wow.
How much is it?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.854
It's $399. We're currently
taking pre-orders at $399.

03:07.954 --> 03:09.256
$399?

03:09.356 --> 03:11.224
Yeah, $399.
Oh. Okay.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.426
What does
it cost you to make?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.361
Our landed cost
is $140.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.762
Oh, wow.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.364
And you <i>must</i> have sales.

03:17.464 --> 03:18.532
Yes, we do.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.100
Three months ago,
we launched on Kickstarter.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.470
Our initial goal was $25,000.
We blew it out of the water.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.972
We had $280,000
in 30 days. Wow.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.775
And we've done over $130,000
in sales since.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.444
And how much of that
have you delivered?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.546
We've just started
the manufacturing process.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.048
With that being none.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.583
So, throughout
our prototyping process,

03:36.683 --> 03:39.419
we've tested our versions with
about 50 different beta testers,

03:39.519 --> 03:40.954
and they all
absolutely loved it.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.856
Well, I'm curious--
Did you used to lay in,

03:42.956 --> 03:45.792
like, a really big, oversize
dog bed or something?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.294
Yeah, so, throughout
my time at school,

03:47.394 --> 03:49.963
I worked as a barista
at a local college coffee shop

03:50.063 --> 03:51.264
where there lived
a Great Dane. Oh.

03:51.364 --> 03:52.466
And so, one day,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.135
during a long shift,
I was looking at this dog

03:55.235 --> 03:57.204
napping really comfortably
in its bed,

03:57.304 --> 03:58.872
and I found myself
kind of jealous.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.142
Like, "Man, why can't
that be me right now?"

04:02.242 --> 04:03.744
And then I had
an idea--

04:03.844 --> 04:05.112
dog beds for humans.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.213
Ta-da!

04:06.313 --> 04:08.014
I was all over Google,
trying to see

04:08.115 --> 04:11.084
if a product like this
existed, but I found nothing.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.853
So I was calling up Yuki,
a good friend,

04:12.953 --> 04:15.255
telling him about the concept,
and he loved it.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.224
So we partnered with
a local designer in Vancouver

04:17.324 --> 04:19.025
to build
our first prototype,

04:19.126 --> 04:21.328
and it turned out so awesome
that we had people

04:21.428 --> 04:23.797
lined up all over our campus
just to try it out.

04:23.897 --> 04:24.965
I-- I just don't get it.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.833
Like, why are people
buying these?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.535
Like, what--
Who's your customer?

04:28.635 --> 04:29.636
Why not?
Why do you need it?

04:29.736 --> 04:30.570
Oh, I like it.
I like it.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.638
Really?
I don't get it.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.540
Your kids-- Oh, come on.
Your kids?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.008
My 8-year-old would
probably love it. Yes.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.010
But, like, do I want
a dog bed in my living room?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.245
Yes!

04:38.345 --> 04:40.247
So we started out just
creating a fun product

04:40.347 --> 04:42.282
that would bring joy and
comfort to people's lives,

04:42.382 --> 04:44.985
but we realized we're building
something bigger than that

04:45.085 --> 04:47.554
when we put it on TikTok
and it went viral,

04:47.654 --> 04:49.790
and we started getting flooded
with messages from people

04:49.890 --> 04:52.125
sharing just how excited
they were for this product.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.661
We spoke with mothers
of children with sensory issues,

04:54.761 --> 04:56.396
veterans with
physical trauma...
Oh, yeah.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.598
...people that suffer
from a range of sleep issues

04:58.698 --> 04:59.666
that just need a more
comfortable place to rest.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.668
But you've never
delivered these.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.303
It's only been three months
since we graduated.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.172
When do you anticipate
being able to deliver?

05:05.272 --> 05:07.941
Because you've got
no real customers at the moment,

05:08.041 --> 05:09.543
which means you've got
no real reviews.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.812
Like, that, to me,
is just a big red flag.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.880
Yeah, we expect to deliver
around late November

05:13.980 --> 05:14.881
to early December.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.683
And when did you
take the orders?

05:16.783 --> 05:19.753
We took orders back
starting from April.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.354
I mean, that's some
pre-order period.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.023
We're talking, what,
seven months?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.224
- That's right. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.626
Why has it taken you so long
to get them delivered?

05:26.726 --> 05:29.162
That's a long time
for just 1,200 units. Exactly.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.531
Well, but you have to have
your production time, right?

05:31.631 --> 05:33.567
I mean, I don't know how long
it takes to make one of these.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.468
How long does it
take to make one?

05:35.569 --> 05:39.139
Yeah, so the 1,200 units
takes about 2 months to make
and 2 months to ship out.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.408
So we're looking at ways
to reduce our lead time,

05:41.508 --> 05:42.709
but this is
our first go at it.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.644
Okay, guys, look,
I think it's a crazy idea.

05:44.744 --> 05:45.846
That's why I like it.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.148
However,
you are unproven, untested.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.951
There's $200,000 for 10%,
imputes to $2 million.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.619
It's not worth
$2 million right now,

05:52.719 --> 05:58.191
so I'll do it for $200,000
cash-a-roni for 30%.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.595
Wow, that's way better
than I thought.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.230
You know, out of him,
that's not so bad.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.831
Mark,
remember our Hug Sleep?

06:04.931 --> 06:06.333
Yeah. Yeah.
It's killing it.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.368
So, like, Mark and I
did a deal with Hug Sleep.
Yeah, yeah.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.136
It was almost like
a sleeping bag, but not.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.071
Yeah, mm-hmm.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.439
Stretchy fabric
that wraps--

06:12.539 --> 06:14.207
I literally use it
every night.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.308
I know you do.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.344
I sleep so much better
in my Hug Sleep.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.979
Yes, it makes you
sleep better.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.047
Yeah. It's like being swaddled
as an adult.
And we know.

06:21.147 --> 06:24.117
We know. We're at $15 million
in sales in two years.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.052
I mean, we love-- Hug Sleep's
a huge inspiration for us,

06:26.152 --> 06:27.587
and a lot of their
kind of story about

06:27.687 --> 06:30.123
helping people with anxiety
just find more comfort.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.558
Without question, yeah.
Without question.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.526
Their messaging about, like,
why don't adults need hugs, too?

06:33.627 --> 06:34.794
That's kind of what
we're trying to embrace here.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.063
Like, adults need comfort.
They need to be cozy.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.032
So, Lori, are you saying
we should work together on
this? So, guys,
can anyone knock you off?

06:39.132 --> 06:41.167
Do you have a patent?
Is there any kind of
protection?

06:41.268 --> 06:45.038
So, right now, we're the first
to market with this product.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.673
We filed for
our provisional patent,

06:46.773 --> 06:49.109
and are currently working
on utility and design patents.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.177
We've also filed for
the trademark for our name

06:51.278 --> 06:54.014
as well as for the phrase
"the dog bed for humans."

06:54.114 --> 06:55.548
Yeah, I don't, I--

06:55.649 --> 06:58.785
It's a dog bed for humans.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.253
I don't see it.
It's not for me. I'm out.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.023
Thank you, Robert.
We appreciate the feedback.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.691
One thing we just want
to touch on is that

07:04.791 --> 07:06.993
this is more than just
a large dog bed.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.595
We actually changed
a lot of the components.

07:08.695 --> 07:11.231
For one thing, we swapped out
the conventional pillow base

07:11.331 --> 07:13.533
for more supportive orthopedic
and memory foam pads

07:13.633 --> 07:14.868
so people can actually
feel supported.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.569
It's a dog bed
for humans.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.039
Listen, I'm going to just,
like, get out of the way here.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.374
But I just--
I do not understand it.

07:21.474 --> 07:24.811
Like, I don't understand
who is buying this product,

07:24.911 --> 07:26.579
and so I'm out.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.615
Yeah.
Thank you for the feedback.
O'Leary: A little bit of
skepticism here.

07:28.715 --> 07:29.849
Guys, we want to--
we want to make an offer.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.619
We think it's a great
complement to Hug Sleep,

07:32.719 --> 07:35.622
so there's all kinds of ways
we can help sell it.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.624
So, we'd like to make you
the offer of the $200,000

07:37.724 --> 07:38.992
you asked for,
for 20%.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.694
The two of us together.
The two of us together.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.695
Um...

07:41.795 --> 07:43.129
Thank you
for that offer.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.597
Noah and I will take
a little bit of time

07:44.698 --> 07:46.466
just to
talk about it.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.335
Seriously, there's something
to talk about?

07:48.435 --> 07:51.871
Would you guys be open
to $200,000 for 15%?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.207
No.
No.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.542
It's a dog bed!

07:55.642 --> 07:58.345
It's got to be enough in there
for both of us to get excited.

07:58.445 --> 07:59.646
And we have experience
with this.

07:59.746 --> 08:00.880
Kevin, do you want
to change your offer?

08:00.981 --> 08:01.915
Alright,
we've got a deal.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.553
Kevin, it just went away from
you, just like that.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.855
Okay, $200,000 for 40%.

08:11.358 --> 08:14.227
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.295
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.363
- Great stuff, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.664
Thank you so much, guys.

08:17.764 --> 08:18.732
Well done, guys.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.134
It's a dog bed
for humans!

08:21.234 --> 08:23.770
Exactly. Exactly.

08:23.870 --> 08:24.738
What are you gonna
do with that?

08:24.838 --> 08:25.839
I'm gonna take a nap.

08:25.939 --> 08:26.973
We're in
the sleep business.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.177
Noah and I just graduated
about three months ago,

08:31.277 --> 08:34.047
and the fact that we're here
right now on "Shark Tank"

08:34.147 --> 08:36.383
and got a deal from
Mark and Lori?
Yeah.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.985
It's-- It's crazy.
I really can't believe it.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.387
And that's a testament
to the fact

08:40.487 --> 08:42.222
that if anyone cares
about something

08:42.322 --> 08:45.291
and dedicates their time
and effort, they can do it.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.439
Mwah.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.679
Next up is a company
who wants to make everyone

09:06.780 --> 09:09.716
in the wedding party
feel as pretty as the bride.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.560
Hi, I'm Ashley.
And I'm Charles.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.062
We're from
Washington, D. C.,

09:22.162 --> 09:26.699
and we're seeking $250,000
for 10% equity in our company,

09:26.800 --> 09:29.536
Bridal Babes,
the first bridal fashion company

09:29.636 --> 09:32.872
for multi-cultural women
and women with curves.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.375
We are changing
the bridal fashion game

09:35.475 --> 09:39.679
with curve-hugging and
attractive bridesmaid dresses.

09:39.779 --> 09:44.017
Yes, they do exist,
and I'm wearing one today.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.018
Whoo!

09:45.118 --> 09:46.152
When we were
getting married,

09:46.252 --> 09:48.721
I remember Ashley mentioning
how difficult it was

09:48.822 --> 09:51.057
to find the perfect dresses
for bridesmaids.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.426
My bridesmaids
dress shopping experience

09:53.526 --> 09:56.396
at traditional bridal shops
was horrible.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.199
I ended up searching
the Internet high and low,

09:59.299 --> 10:01.501
and finally found something
that would work,

10:01.601 --> 10:04.971
and when my girls put it on,
they instantly fell in love.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.307
And the wedding went viral
because no one had ever seen

10:07.407 --> 10:09.976
bridesmaids in such
stunning looks before.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.778
That's when we knew
that we were on to something.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.947
We went from
high school sweethearts

10:14.047 --> 10:17.417
to newlyweds and
business partners overnight.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.618
Aww.

10:18.718 --> 10:21.354
Bridal Babes offers gowns
in inclusive sizing,

10:21.454 --> 10:23.056
which we
pride ourselves on,

10:23.156 --> 10:26.960
and a wide range of shades
that really pop on all skin tones.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.195
Brides and bridesmaids
can also shop

10:29.295 --> 10:30.663
from the comfort
of their home

10:30.763 --> 10:32.699
through our live
virtual consultations

10:32.799 --> 10:34.734
and our thriving
social media community.

10:34.834 --> 10:38.471
So, Sharks, now that you know
a little bit about Bridal Babes,

10:38.571 --> 10:40.173
who's ready to get...

10:40.273 --> 10:41.407
Hitched?
Hitched?

10:41.508 --> 10:43.376
Wow. So good.
Great job.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.511
Great job, guys.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.845
That's
a beautiful dress.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.313
Ashley, what do they cost--
They're beautiful, first of all.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.414
Thank you. Absolutely.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.817
What do they cost?
Give us an average.

10:50.917 --> 10:51.985
We have two collections.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.488
Our Classic Collection
averages $13.31,

10:55.588 --> 10:57.724
and we price them
at $44.05.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.959
Wow.
That's amazingly affordable.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.896
Sorry, how much?
You sell Ashley's dress...

11:02.996 --> 11:04.230
Well, not--
That's the Luxe Collection.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.331
This is
the Luxe Collection.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.599
Okay, how much would
Ashley's dress be?

11:06.699 --> 11:10.303
$67 landed, and we'll sell it
for about $228 on average.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.306
Hang on.
That dress is $200?

11:13.406 --> 11:15.675
It's amazing.
Isn't that really expensive
for a bridal dress?

11:15.775 --> 11:17.477
No.
So, it's actually not.

11:17.577 --> 11:18.578
- It's not?
- Not at all.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.246
But we do offer
an affordable line

11:20.346 --> 11:22.081
as well as
a more high-end line.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.251
And our goal really is
to provide as much diversity

11:25.351 --> 11:27.654
in the product type,
because we want to service

11:27.754 --> 11:30.456
an audience that has been
overlooked for years.

11:30.557 --> 11:34.994
I mean, guys, you are speaking
my language 100% and entirely.

11:35.094 --> 11:39.566
Like, the whole inclusive
thing is a huge gap in the market.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.234
I really just want to
understand, for you guys,

11:41.334 --> 11:42.502
like, what is inclusive?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.537
Like, what are you
actually selling? What sizes?

11:44.637 --> 11:48.107
Inclusive sizing
is sizes 2 through 26,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.210
which are actually
ready to ship.
That's inclusive.

11:50.310 --> 11:55.582
We also have a special-order
collection in sizes 26 to 32.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.283
The greatest challenge
for every business

11:57.383 --> 12:00.086
that services weddings
is customer acquisition.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.021
How are you getting
your customer?

12:02.121 --> 12:05.225
So our core platform we're on
is Instagram.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.494
Our Instagram community
is about 90,000 followers,

12:08.595 --> 12:10.863
and we have about
60,000 on TikTok,

12:10.964 --> 12:12.699
which has just grown tremendously.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.901
We are a community.
We talk to our customers.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.569
We post three to four
times a day.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.671
But the secret sauce
to getting those customers

12:18.771 --> 12:20.240
is the fabric
you all have.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.541
Okay,
so is it this one?

12:21.641 --> 12:23.543
This is what actually changed
our business model.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.111
How can a fabric be--

12:25.211 --> 12:26.813
So, when we put
these dresses out,

12:26.913 --> 12:29.182
they went viral
because people were like,

12:29.282 --> 12:31.384
"Oh, my gosh,
this looks like satin,

12:31.484 --> 12:32.518
but I see these curvy women
in it."

12:32.619 --> 12:34.120
It's insane.
Which, typically...

12:34.220 --> 12:35.622
Yeah, you're right.
...curvy women
cannot wear satin.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.223
Help me understand.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.959
I mean, Emma and Lori
right away went,

12:40.059 --> 12:41.227
"Ooh, this is great."

12:41.327 --> 12:43.963
And I'm sitting here going,
"Why is this great?"

12:44.063 --> 12:46.366
The key is really
the stretch in the fabric.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.567
It's so stretchy.
It can go in bags.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.036
So it drapes your curves.
It drapes your curves.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.639
But this also really helps you
with returns, right?

12:52.739 --> 12:54.007
Yes, absolutely.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.074
Because if you've got
a fabric like this,

12:55.174 --> 12:56.743
with this crazy amount
of stretch in it,

12:56.843 --> 12:57.977
you're not getting
the same returns... Exactly.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.112
...as with
a rigid fabric.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.246
Tell us about sales.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.582
We have lifetime sales
of $2 million.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.650
$2 million?

13:03.750 --> 13:05.418
Wow.
Yes, $2 million.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.287
Wow!
But I also want to talk to you
about our growth.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.256
So year to date,
we're at $850,000.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.491
In year one,
we were at $30,000.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.593
Which year was that, too?
What year was that?

13:13.693 --> 13:16.929
2019. In year two,
we were at $200,000.

13:17.030 --> 13:20.633
So it was a nice jump, but
we were almost five times that

13:20.733 --> 13:23.503
in year three,
with $950,000.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.471
Now, we were a little shy
of our goal of $1 million,

13:25.571 --> 13:28.007
but we're projected to be
there this year, at $1.2
million.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.242
- Wow.
- Wow!

13:29.342 --> 13:30.743
That's major, guys.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.145
Are you profitable?

13:32.245 --> 13:34.714
Last year,
we made $20,000.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.115
Are you paying yourselves
a salary?

13:36.215 --> 13:37.250
$60,000.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.785
Each or total?
Each.

13:38.885 --> 13:39.952
Alright, that's fine.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.021
How much are you guys
spending on advertising?

13:42.121 --> 13:46.326
So, we spend about 30%
of our revenue on advertising,

13:46.426 --> 13:49.095
and that's super important,
because each customer

13:49.195 --> 13:52.065
we bring in
is not just one customer.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.468
Right, of course. Right.
If we can bring in a bride,
that's eight bridesmaids.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.537
I know this business
incredibly well.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.672
I make inclusive sizing
at both SKIMS and Good American.

13:59.772 --> 14:00.907
Yes.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.709
And it makes the margin
profile really tricky.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.611
So talk to me about margins
on both of the ranges, please.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.581
So, we're at 70%
for both of the ranges.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.216
For your
direct-to-consumer sales?

14:10.316 --> 14:12.352
Yeah.
We only sell direct.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.721
Can you please tell me
both of your backgrounds?

14:14.821 --> 14:17.357
I was in marketing for
a little over a decade

14:17.457 --> 14:18.725
before coming
full-time.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.460
I worked for
huge CPG brands

14:20.560 --> 14:22.862
like Neutrogena,
The Laughing Cow. Wow.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.465
I was actually doing some of,
like, the first Facebook ads,

14:25.565 --> 14:26.799
back in 2009,

14:26.899 --> 14:29.068
so that's why I'm kind of like
the digital person.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.903
Gotcha. Thank you.
And you?

14:31.003 --> 14:34.006
Yes. I played football
most of my life.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.376
Afterwards, I became
a child psychiatric specialist

14:36.476 --> 14:38.511
at a children's hospital,
and then I moved

14:38.611 --> 14:40.680
into law enforcement
and became a detective.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.615
Wow. Are you still a
detective, or do you do this
full-time?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.917
No. Actually,
I left the police force

14:45.051 --> 14:46.719
to completely
follow this dream.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.121
So, guys,
what's the vision?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.522
What do you want to do
with this brand?

14:49.622 --> 14:52.792
The biggest thing for us
is showcasing diversity

14:52.892 --> 14:56.195
in a space that never saw
brides and couples

14:56.295 --> 15:00.032
or even bridesmaids of color
in media campaigns.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.602
So it's so important to us
to have that component.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.705
And making sure that we are
celebrating all body types.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.673
And how big do you want
to take the business?

15:07.774 --> 15:09.742
Well, Charles has
a huge vision.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.310
We want to be
a $500 million company.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.512
Whoa.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.047
The real question I have is,
what do you need?

15:15.148 --> 15:17.817
For you to get to $500
million, what are those first steps

15:17.917 --> 15:19.519
you need to take,
and where do you need help?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.754
So we want to get more
team members

15:21.854 --> 15:23.689
to create
supply-chain efficiency,

15:23.790 --> 15:25.858
because we want to be able
to get the customers

15:25.958 --> 15:27.827
what they need, when they
need, as fast as we can.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.462
How many people do you
have working for you?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.330
It's just the two of us
full time.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.933
Charles has one contractor
that he works with seasonally.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.268
So when you guys
get orders,

15:35.368 --> 15:36.335
you just grind it out
in the warehouse that you
have?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.136
Yes.
Yes.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.337
- Wow.
- That's amazing.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.440
Okay, so who's actually
making the dresses?

15:40.540 --> 15:43.543
So, we have a number
of manufacturers overseas.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.078
What's your lead time
on-- on a dress or dresses?

15:46.179 --> 15:49.982
It takes about two to
three weeks to actually
produce the dresses.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.984
But then, shipping,
I'm sure you all know,

15:52.084 --> 15:53.186
has been kind of
a nightmare.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.420
Right. So you're having--
Pain in the ass right now.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.255
So because we've been
selling out so quickly,

15:56.355 --> 15:59.125
we've had to incur additional
cost to do air shipping.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.993
Well, first of all,
super impressive.

16:01.093 --> 16:04.831
I love the business,
but I-I can't add value

16:04.931 --> 16:06.866
in the bridal dress business.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.768
It's just not
my forte.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.103
Thank you for coming,
but I'm out.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.338
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.341
Guys, I'm-- I'm very
impressed. I'm in this space.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.010
I don't know if you know your
customer acquisition cost yet.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.946
It's one of the highest
in the fashion business,

16:20.046 --> 16:21.147
is capturing the bride

16:21.247 --> 16:22.849
when she's making
her purchase decision.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.917
Yes.
I wish you the best,
but it's-- it's not for me.

16:25.051 --> 16:25.985
I'm out.

16:26.085 --> 16:26.986
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:27.086 --> 16:28.988
Guys, listen,
I love the fact

16:29.088 --> 16:31.357
that you've managed
to stay out of the trap

16:31.457 --> 16:33.726
of the kind of
traditional wedding business,

16:33.826 --> 16:36.829
because it's my belief that
any brand that's going to scale

16:36.929 --> 16:38.297
and do really well now

16:38.397 --> 16:40.299
has to be rooted
in some kind of community.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.836
It's the only way that we can
keep advertising cost down

16:43.936 --> 16:45.338
and keep that
word of mouth going

16:45.438 --> 16:47.039
and keep the
customers excited.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.741
There's so much promise
in this business,

16:48.841 --> 16:52.011
so I definitely would love
to give you guys an offer.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.981
I think that your valuation
is a little steep.

16:55.081 --> 16:58.484
So, you came in asking
for $250,000 for 10%,

16:58.584 --> 17:01.587
and I will happily
give you guys $250,000,

17:01.687 --> 17:03.489
but I want 25%
of the business.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.395
Ohh, your valuation
just got crushed.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.207
Two Sharks are out.

17:21.307 --> 17:24.110
Charles and Ashley have an
offer on the table from Emma

17:24.210 --> 17:26.245
for their inclusive
bridal dress business,

17:26.345 --> 17:28.114
Bridal Babes,

17:28.214 --> 17:30.149
but she wants a bigger chunk
of the business

17:30.249 --> 17:32.585
than they came in offering.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.621
I think that your valuation
is a little steep.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.491
So, you came in asking
for $250,000 for 10%,

17:38.591 --> 17:41.928
and I will happily
give you guys $250,000,

17:42.028 --> 17:44.030
but I want 25%
of the business.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.735
Ohh, your valuation
just got crushed.

17:49.835 --> 17:54.006
Okay. Thank you. Um...

17:54.106 --> 17:55.942
Would you do, um...?

17:56.042 --> 17:56.742
Oh, sorry.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.680
We could
go for...15%?

18:03.182 --> 18:06.485
How about 17.5%?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.788
Make it 20%, and you've
got yourself a deal.

18:11.557 --> 18:12.458
We got a deal!

18:14.193 --> 18:15.027
O'Leary: Wow.

18:15.127 --> 18:17.363
Oh, my gosh!
I love it.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.298
So amazing!
Thank you.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.801
Well done, guys. Amazing.
You look beautiful.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.069
Thank you.
Congrats, guys.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.470
- Thank you. Have a good one.
- Well done, well done.

18:24.570 --> 18:28.674
They're on to something.
They're on to an absolute winner.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.909
I told you.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.345
Ahh!
I cannot believe this!

18:32.445 --> 18:33.412
We did it!
We did!

18:33.512 --> 18:34.714
Congratulations!
I'm so happy!

18:34.814 --> 18:36.782
I love you so much.
Yay!

18:40.186 --> 18:43.356
In Season 13, we watched
Bo Haaber and Rasmus Barfred

18:43.456 --> 18:44.857
make a deal with
Robert Herjavec

18:44.957 --> 18:48.027
for their custom swim goggles
company, TheMagic5.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.296
I'll give you
$1 million for 6.5%.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.797
We'll take it.
Alright!

18:51.897 --> 18:54.700
Let's see what
they're up to now.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.935
When we aired
on "Shark Tank,"

18:56.035 --> 18:59.138
we got a thousand times
more traffic to our website.

18:59.238 --> 19:01.240
Normally, we would have
30 people on our site.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.276
We had 30,000 people,
and it resulted in more than

19:04.377 --> 19:07.546
$45,000 in revenue
in the first 24 hours.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.015
Since we
pitched the Sharks,

19:09.115 --> 19:11.817
we've sold more
than 85,000 goggles

19:11.917 --> 19:15.388
and made more than
$4.1 million in sales.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.124
But the deal got even sweeter,
because another Shark

19:18.224 --> 19:20.159
didn't want to miss out
on our technology.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.362
So I invested in TheMagic5.
And guess what? That's not all.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.431
Ta-da.

19:25.531 --> 19:26.632
Yeah, I loved
the deal so much

19:26.732 --> 19:28.067
that I went up to Robert
after the show and said,

19:28.167 --> 19:30.536
"Look, Robert,
you negotiated a great deal."

19:30.636 --> 19:31.837
I did.
"Why don't you let me in?"

19:31.937 --> 19:34.674
Mark and his team have
provided strategic guidance

19:34.774 --> 19:36.175
all around the business.

19:36.275 --> 19:39.812
And Robert has
been focused on how to
get to new customers,

19:39.912 --> 19:41.881
especially online.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.816
With the success of
our swimming goggles,

19:43.916 --> 19:46.886
we are now moving
into other product areas.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.855
Virtual reality headsets
are very uncomfortable,

19:49.955 --> 19:51.490
so we have taken
our technology

19:51.590 --> 19:54.627
and enabled a custom fit
facial interface.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.463
This will make the headset
much more comfortable to wear,

19:57.563 --> 20:00.266
and you can wear your headset
for a longer time.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.769
We've also secured a
partnership with Canyon Bicycles.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.272
Canyon will be using
our customizing technology.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.808
That will enable the biker
to control the bike better,

20:08.908 --> 20:11.110
and at the same time,
be more comfortable.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.112
My advice for
an entrepreneur is,

20:13.212 --> 20:14.613
ask yourself
the difficult question--

20:14.714 --> 20:16.782
do you really solve a problem,
and do you solve it

20:16.882 --> 20:19.385
in a way that makes sense
for the customer?

20:19.485 --> 20:22.254
These guys, when you talk
to them, they're all in.

20:22.354 --> 20:23.222
Yeah.
It's all they think about,

20:23.322 --> 20:24.457
how to make
swimmers better,

20:24.557 --> 20:25.591
how to make
goggles better.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.293
They're very single-minded
and very focused,

20:27.393 --> 20:28.761
and that's just
a great trait.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.363
You've got to live and breathe
your product and your company.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.499
And they certainly do.
And they do, yeah.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.316
Next into the Tank is a way

20:50.416 --> 20:54.053
to keep kids' creativity
mess-free.

20:57.823 --> 20:58.858
Aww.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.261
Hi, Sharks.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.729
My name is
Amy Leinbach.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.264
And I'm Marlo Leinbach,

21:05.364 --> 21:07.533
from Huntington Beach, California.

21:07.633 --> 21:11.103
We're seeking $100,000
for 20% of our company,

21:11.203 --> 21:12.138
Big Bee...

21:12.238 --> 21:13.239
Little Bee.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.473
Please!
Aww.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.709
Sharks, do you know
the best part

21:16.809 --> 21:19.779
about arts-and-crafts
time?

21:19.879 --> 21:22.081
You're allowed to
make a mess.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.350
Mess! Mess! Mess!

21:24.450 --> 21:27.887
But when I'm all done,
the fun stops.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.824
There's paper and pom-poms
and paste everywhere.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.960
And if I don't find my markers
and caps that rolled away,

21:35.060 --> 21:36.395
they'll dry out.

21:36.495 --> 21:37.663
Don't worry, Mommy.

21:37.763 --> 21:40.699
That's why I invented
the Marker Parker,

21:40.800 --> 21:43.269
the perfect spot
to park your markers.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.436
Cool.
How does it work?

21:44.537 --> 21:47.706
Marker Parker
grips your marker caps tight,

21:47.807 --> 21:50.976
so you just remove
the drawing part.

21:51.076 --> 21:54.013
And when you're done with it,
you put it right back.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.183
Marker Parker's ergonomic
shape and squishy texture

21:57.283 --> 21:59.318
makes it easy
for kids to grip,

21:59.418 --> 22:01.420
and its playful design
encourages them

22:01.520 --> 22:04.089
to put their markers back
where they belong.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.959
So no more markers
rolling onto the floor.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.261
No more lost
marker caps.

22:09.361 --> 22:11.864
No more
dried-out markers.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.699
And when a marker
<i>does</i> run out of ink,

22:13.799 --> 22:17.203
the grown-up
just wiggles out the cap...

22:19.605 --> 22:22.341
And smushes
a new one back in.

22:22.441 --> 22:25.344
Finally, an easy system
to keep my markers

22:25.444 --> 22:28.414
capped and contained,
at home and on the go.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.582
So, Sharks,

22:29.682 --> 22:32.585
who wants to help kids
increase their independence,

22:32.685 --> 22:34.753
develop good
organization skills...

22:34.854 --> 22:38.791
And save the planet from
a whole lot of wasted markers?

22:38.891 --> 22:41.193
With the Marker Parker!

22:41.293 --> 22:43.495
- Great job!
- Great job!

22:43.596 --> 22:45.397
- You were amazing!
- Good job.

22:45.497 --> 22:47.533
Marlo, did you
make these drawings?

22:47.633 --> 22:52.204
Yes, and those words on top
are something you once said.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.406
You did a great job.
Thank you.

22:54.506 --> 22:55.674
Nice job.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.943
O'Leary: Marlo, I just found
something out there.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.378
I learned I'm bald.

22:59.478 --> 23:00.880
I had no idea.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.449
Oh, no!

23:03.549 --> 23:06.318
Marlo, how old are
you? 7 1/2.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.354
You're 7 1/2? Wow.
Wow.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.956
Do you want to try out
your Marker Parker?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.258
- Yes.
- We do.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.393
So what you're selling

23:14.493 --> 23:18.330
is what the markers are in
or the whole set?

23:18.430 --> 23:19.732
What do we make?
Um, the marker.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.467
No, the base.
I mean the base.

23:21.567 --> 23:22.835
Yeah, okay.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.470
So it's a holder. Yeah.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.905
Do these work
for any pens?

23:26.005 --> 23:28.007
Like, you can put whatever
markers you want inside?

23:28.107 --> 23:30.876
That SKU works for
broad-tip markers,

23:30.976 --> 23:32.444
but actually,

23:32.544 --> 23:35.881
with our current run
that's going on right now,

23:35.981 --> 23:37.850
we decided to make
a little modification

23:37.950 --> 23:41.086
in order to make it fit
for fine-tip markers as well.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.589
Amy, it's an eloquent
solution. I get it.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.524
But what stops
the manufacturer,

23:45.624 --> 23:47.726
having seen this,
from doing it themselves?

23:47.826 --> 23:50.296
We filed a provisional patent
back in November.

23:50.396 --> 23:53.365
She thought of the idea
exactly one year ago, July--

23:53.465 --> 23:54.667
Oh,
Marlo thought of the idea.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.202
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Yeah, she invented this.

23:57.303 --> 23:58.370
- Aww.
- Oh, I had no idea.

23:58.470 --> 23:59.405
I just helped her take it
to the finish line.

23:59.505 --> 24:00.572
And what do
you sell it for?

24:00.673 --> 24:03.075
What's the price?
$15.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.276
-$15.
- Wow.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.845
You do? And what does
it cost you to make this?

24:06.946 --> 24:07.980
$2.71, landed.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.148
- Wow.
- Nice.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.449
- Wow. Great margin.
- That's really great.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.117
Yeah!
So, Amy,

24:12.217 --> 24:13.585
how are you selling these
at the moment?

24:13.686 --> 24:14.820
How are you marketing them?

24:14.920 --> 24:18.557
So, Big Bee, Little Bee is
the business that we started

24:18.657 --> 24:21.527
about six years ago,
and it just started with

24:21.627 --> 24:25.130
a-a towel that I invented
for her as a baby.

24:25.230 --> 24:27.132
Do you want to share
some of our-- our products?

24:27.232 --> 24:29.368
Sure.
This is the ScrubBEE.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.304
It helps kids learn
to wash themselves.

24:32.404 --> 24:35.341
It's not a sponge,
so germs don't collect on it,

24:35.441 --> 24:38.944
and it has a solid handle
and soft bristles.

24:39.044 --> 24:42.781
Oh, great idea. Marlo,
and do you make the straw too?

24:42.881 --> 24:44.516
So, that-- that's
the Build-A-Straw.

24:44.616 --> 24:46.585
That becomes
a full-size straw.

24:46.685 --> 24:47.786
Ohh.

24:47.886 --> 24:49.054
It's completely unique
in that--

24:49.154 --> 24:51.290
and so when you take it apart,
it's super easy to clean.

24:51.390 --> 24:53.592
So, Amy, obviously, you have a
lot of products in the company.

24:53.692 --> 24:54.960
Like, what's your
hero product?

24:55.060 --> 24:56.895
What are you selling, and
how much of it are you
selling?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.731
Okay, so,
our hero product

24:58.831 --> 25:00.933
has been
that little silicone scrubber.

25:01.033 --> 25:06.739
So, last year, we did
$230,000 worth of sales.

25:06.839 --> 25:07.740
Of the scrubber?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.274
You know,
of the whole business.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.275
Of everything.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.244
But the scrubber was,
you know--

25:12.344 --> 25:13.278
is our main product.

25:13.379 --> 25:15.581
Of what percentage?
And that's with--

25:15.681 --> 25:16.682
Like 80%.

25:16.782 --> 25:17.783
Oh, wow.
Yeah, but...

25:17.883 --> 25:19.084
Wow.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.620
...that's with losing all
inventory in the second half.

25:21.720 --> 25:27.893
It has been unbelievably
difficult with quality issues,

25:27.993 --> 25:29.995
manufacturing,
supply chain.

25:30.095 --> 25:32.431
On your sales last year,
did you make a profit

25:32.531 --> 25:33.866
or did you lose money?

25:33.966 --> 25:40.339
So, we-- we grossed $97,000,
and we were profitable $2,200.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.707
Whoo!
Aww!

25:41.807 --> 25:45.277
So not only did we survive,
but we made two grand.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.612
Please don't ask me
about this year.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.980
What-- What about this year?
Ohh...

25:48.080 --> 25:49.348
Please don't ask me.
Oh, no.

25:49.448 --> 25:50.382
Please tell us.
I'm kidding.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.151
I will address--
I will address that.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.787
So, this year to date,
$110,000.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.822
We did not have ScrubBEEs
in the first half.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.925
Are you making any money
on that $110,000?

26:00.025 --> 26:01.593
No, I have lost
a fortune this year.

26:01.693 --> 26:05.197
So, right now, I'm down
$77,000, and here's why--

26:05.297 --> 26:06.932
$77,000?
Here's why.

26:07.032 --> 26:10.369
Oh. Sorry.
When my daughter came to me
with this product idea

26:10.469 --> 26:13.639
this time last year,
this was not in the pipeline.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.774
We have another product
back here that already was.

26:15.874 --> 26:17.976
The train was moving
on that product.

26:18.077 --> 26:23.382
But I was
raised by parents who...

26:23.482 --> 26:24.650
"Reach for the stars.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.884
Follow your dreams."

26:25.984 --> 26:28.620
Providing me
with every resource

26:28.720 --> 26:30.689
they could possibly
pull together

26:30.789 --> 26:32.124
to-- to help me invent,

26:32.224 --> 26:33.225
'cause that's
what I loved.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.127
I had a fear of numbers,
and it stopped me

26:35.227 --> 26:38.230
from starting a business
for a very long time.

26:38.330 --> 26:42.000
But they supported me,
and so I support her.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.103
And when she had this idea,
I asked her, I said,

26:44.203 --> 26:45.237
"This is brilliant.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.439
Do you want to make this
for other children?"

26:47.539 --> 26:50.776
When she said, "Yes,"

26:50.876 --> 26:51.977
I found the money.

26:52.077 --> 26:56.148
I've invested, so far,
$100,000 of my own money.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.584
If you ask me
in two weeks from now,

26:58.684 --> 27:01.220
I'll tell you I invested
$166,000 of my own money.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.689
Wow. Wow.
O'Leary: So, Amy and Marlo,

27:03.789 --> 27:05.491
let me just say that,
you know,

27:05.591 --> 27:07.126
we don't get many
7-year-olds in here holding--

27:07.226 --> 27:08.660
7 1/2!

27:08.760 --> 27:10.262
- 7 1/2.
- 7 1/2, Kevin.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.197
That's very impressive.
Very impressive.
You did a great job.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.767
And, Amy, um, wonderful that
you're supporting your daughter

27:15.868 --> 27:17.503
towards a journey
of entrepreneurship.

27:17.603 --> 27:18.804
That's great.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.039
However, telling me
you have fear of numbers--

27:21.140 --> 27:22.474
that's not a good story.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.409
I know.
As an investor,
what I look for

27:24.510 --> 27:26.512
is an opportunity
to take my capital

27:26.612 --> 27:29.181
and pour it on
a working business model.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.016
It's like pouring
gasoline on a fire,

27:31.116 --> 27:33.619
and I get my returns
because I accelerate

27:33.719 --> 27:35.988
by helping that company grow
and acquire customers

27:36.088 --> 27:38.090
and all the other things
that a Shark does.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.993
This has a lot of problems
in it right now.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.895
May I challenge you
for a second, please?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.730
Well, I want to get
to a place here.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.265
Sure, sorry.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.432
I'm out.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.070
I think you're going to want
to take that back.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.939
Well, let's see.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.107
This is what's next.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.975
This is
the food container.

27:57.075 --> 27:58.911
Food?
For, like, a sandwich?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.345
Food, yes. Yeah. Yeah.

28:00.445 --> 28:03.549
And it could fit
a whole apple in there.

28:03.649 --> 28:06.785
So are they-- are they
silicone sandwich storage,

28:06.885 --> 28:08.387
individual, like, self...?
Yeah.

28:08.487 --> 28:09.388
Yeah, so basically--

28:09.488 --> 28:10.622
Guys, let me jump in
real quick here.

28:10.722 --> 28:11.490
Oh.

28:11.590 --> 28:12.858
Look, one of
the great traits

28:12.958 --> 28:14.960
of any good entrepreneur
is resilience,

28:15.060 --> 28:16.662
and you certainly
have shown that.

28:16.762 --> 28:20.499
But you also have
inventor-itis, right?

28:20.599 --> 28:22.367
Which is one of
the worst traits

28:22.467 --> 28:26.872
an entrepreneur can have,
because you lost $77,000.

28:26.972 --> 28:29.541
You've got to solve the
problems that are in front of
you first.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.043
If you would have
come in and said,

28:31.143 --> 28:32.578
"The marker,
we're shipping it.

28:32.678 --> 28:34.146
We've got these sales."
We are. We do.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.547
"We've got-- We've got
cash in the bank."

28:35.647 --> 28:36.982
It's going
in Buybuy Baby.

28:37.082 --> 28:38.383
Just 'cause it's
in Buybuy Baby--

28:38.483 --> 28:40.152
You would be telling us
the numbers, right?

28:40.252 --> 28:42.588
I'll tell you the numbers.
$8,500 in sales.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.256
How many units
have we sold?

28:44.356 --> 28:46.225
Over a thousand.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.393
Over a thousand
in three-and-a-half--

28:48.493 --> 28:49.995
Okay. Amy, I'm out.
I'm out. Sorry.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.830
Okay.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.265
Amy, are you
doing this alone?

28:53.365 --> 28:54.866
No.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.301
Oh, well, of course.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.837
Of course. Of course.
She's my light.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.272
But-- But, yes.

29:00.372 --> 29:04.810
I completely love
you're teaching your daughter

29:04.910 --> 29:06.144
how to think big

29:06.245 --> 29:08.614
and how to be creative
and inventive.

29:08.714 --> 29:11.383
At the same time,
when you come up with an idea,

29:11.483 --> 29:12.951
you perfect it.

29:13.051 --> 29:15.454
You make that one product
a huge success,

29:15.554 --> 29:17.522
and then you go to the next.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.790
So, I think you just have

29:18.890 --> 29:21.460
overextended yourself
in every way.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.229
I'm so sorry.
I'm out.

29:24.329 --> 29:26.265
It's okay.
Thank you, Lori.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.901
Guys, I-I really-- So, I
really admire what you've
done.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.970
And I think just seeing
the two of you stand here

29:32.070 --> 29:35.674
as a mother and daughter,
it's just, like, amazing.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.442
You know,
it warms the heart.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.044
I do think that
you've probably

29:39.144 --> 29:40.612
overextended yourself
a little bit.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.015
There's so many products
in this brand

29:43.115 --> 29:46.385
that I don't quite understand
what you stand for, right?

29:46.485 --> 29:48.153
And I do think
there's an element

29:48.253 --> 29:52.224
of having a hero product,
really, really perfecting that,

29:52.324 --> 29:54.593
and then thinking about
other things.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.161
At the moment,
the approach just feels

29:56.261 --> 29:57.496
a little bit scatterbrained.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.966
And while this might be
an amazing business for you two,

30:01.066 --> 30:02.801
I just don't think it's
something that I can invest in.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.836
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.874
Thank you
for your time.

30:08.974 --> 30:12.444
Oh, you're so welcome.
You're so welcome. Aww.

30:12.544 --> 30:16.715
Marlo, I have 4-year-old
twins, and they love to draw.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.818
They would love
something like this.

30:19.918 --> 30:24.189
And I know you can't see it,
but I have bees on my suit.

30:24.289 --> 30:27.526
And so I love the bees.
I love bees.

30:27.626 --> 30:31.496
Amy, I was going
to make you an offer,

30:31.596 --> 30:34.733
until you started
showing us more product.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.736
I think, you know,
when you're really small,

30:37.836 --> 30:40.806
you have to be laser focused,
and I kind of feel that

30:40.906 --> 30:44.176
your real strength and value
is inventing.

30:44.276 --> 30:48.413
So perhaps you look at us
as a design studio

30:48.513 --> 30:49.648
and license
these products.

30:49.748 --> 30:53.352
Amy, I-I think you are
phenomenal at design.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.520
That's a really
good way to look at it.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.090
But if you're a design studio,
you need somebody to sell it.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.958
I'm not so much
a license guy.

31:00.058 --> 31:02.794
I want to help build
the business around this.

31:02.894 --> 31:06.365
I mean, I wish you all the
best, but for the business investment,

31:06.465 --> 31:09.134
I'm sorry, I'm out.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.069
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

31:11.169 --> 31:12.371
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck, guys.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.372
Good luck, guys.

31:13.472 --> 31:14.272
Keep on doing
what you do.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.173
Thank you, guys.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.608
Good job, Marlo.
You were amazing.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.944
Good job, Marlo.
You were amazing.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.547
I'm happy that Mama
got what she wanted.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.384
She like-- She always wanted
to go on "Shark Tank,"

31:25.484 --> 31:28.520
and she's on
"Shark Tank" now.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.556
I did get what I wanted, honey.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.658
Well, Robert, I think
you did a great job

31:33.759 --> 31:35.327
of crushing
Marlo's dreams.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.995
No kidding. "I was
going to make you an offer..."

31:37.095 --> 31:38.463
7 1/2 years old.
Oh, my God.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.564
She's decimated.
I mean--

31:39.664 --> 31:41.266
Well, I was.
I was!

31:41.366 --> 31:42.501
Well, then do it!

31:42.601 --> 31:45.937
It broke my heart, what you
did. I wept like a baby.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.751
Next up is a company

31:59.851 --> 32:02.721
that combines luxury
with the great outdoors.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.532
Hi, Sharks.

32:13.632 --> 32:17.936
My name is Tracy Slocum,
and I'm from Albany, New York.

32:18.036 --> 32:21.706
I'm the CEO and founder
of Pretty Rugged.

32:21.807 --> 32:26.812
Today I'm seeking $200,000
for 10% of my company.

32:26.912 --> 32:30.615
Sharks,
my great-great-grandfather

32:30.715 --> 32:34.052
was the first man
to sail alone around the world.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.821
His name was
Captain Joshua Slocum.

32:35.921 --> 32:36.988
I'm Tracy Slocum.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.323
Wow.
That's pretty cool.

32:38.423 --> 32:40.492
He was a pioneer of his time,

32:40.592 --> 32:44.696
and his trailblazing spirit
is sewn into everything I do.

32:44.796 --> 32:49.100
So, Sharks, I made a blanket
that is waterproof and windproof

32:49.201 --> 32:52.537
on one side,
and faux fur on the other.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.574
You can see that this is
the faux-fur side,

32:55.674 --> 32:58.310
and this is the waterproof
and windproof side.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.112
And that's when
Pretty Rugged was born.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.014
But I didn't just
stop there, Sharks.

33:03.114 --> 33:06.318
I created an entire
lifestyle brand

33:06.418 --> 33:08.720
around luxury and function,

33:08.820 --> 33:14.226
making products that were made
for life, luxury redefined.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.062
So, Sharks, who wants to jump
on this ride with me

33:17.162 --> 33:19.097
and take this around the world

33:19.197 --> 33:21.533
just like
my great-great-grandfather
did?

33:21.633 --> 33:23.101
Wow.
Wow.

33:23.201 --> 33:25.036
That's pretty cool
that he went around the world.

33:25.136 --> 33:27.973
Yeah, he was 51 years old
when he did it.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.108
He had lost the love
of his life. Aw.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.810
He was given a boat.

33:31.910 --> 33:35.580
He rebuilt that boat
in about 13 months. Wow.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.117
And while he rebuilt it,
he rebuilt himself.

33:39.217 --> 33:43.088
And he had a goal
that was so big,

33:43.188 --> 33:44.656
and people really doubted him.

33:44.756 --> 33:49.928
And I can really relate to
this heritage and this DNA myself.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.964
I started Pretty Rugged
when I was 43 years old.

33:53.064 --> 33:54.399
And how long ago was that,
Tracy?

33:54.499 --> 33:56.401
That was in 2017.

33:56.501 --> 33:57.769
Do you want to tell us
what these are?

33:57.869 --> 33:58.870
Can we open these?

33:58.970 --> 34:01.339
Yes, would you please
open your gifts?

34:01.439 --> 34:02.741
Oh, wow.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.209
These are very nice, Tracy.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.277
Beautiful.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.878
My original
faux-fur blankets.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.247
They're meant to feel
like real sheared mink.
They do.

34:09.347 --> 34:13.084
And the backing's waterproof,
so the fur goes around you,

34:13.184 --> 34:15.587
and you sit on a waterproof,
like a-a--

34:15.687 --> 34:16.755
I have it backwards.

34:16.855 --> 34:17.756
You do.

34:17.856 --> 34:18.723
Come on, Robert.
Sort it out.

34:18.823 --> 34:19.958
This is how it works, Robert.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.860
Look at you.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.595
Never mind me,
I'm gonna take a snooze

34:23.695 --> 34:24.629
during your presentation.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.064
Okay, I know.
I hope not.

34:26.164 --> 34:27.432
But this is the real me.

34:27.532 --> 34:31.336
So, picture being outside,
and you're sitting around,

34:31.436 --> 34:32.871
and you're on
either wet seats--

34:32.971 --> 34:35.173
You know how the dew makes
the seats get wet?

34:35.273 --> 34:36.541
Yeah, absolutely.
It's cold.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.143
Okay, so this is--
That looks beautiful on you.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.611
Thank you.

34:39.711 --> 34:44.516
So I created the blanket line,
and I launched in 2018.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.052
I walked into
the Jacob Javits Center,

34:47.152 --> 34:50.255
and it was a huge
New York Now show.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.024
I had never been
to a trade show in my life.

34:53.124 --> 34:56.194
I walked in with paper walls
and a pallet table

34:56.294 --> 34:57.696
that I made myself,

34:57.796 --> 35:02.500
and I left there winning Best
New Product and Best in Market.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.602
- Wow.
- Wow.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.503
And I was awarded,
in my first year,

35:05.604 --> 35:07.005
one of
Oprah's Favorite Things.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.240
Wow!
I had instant credibility.

35:09.341 --> 35:12.344
After I won my awards
at the New York Now,

35:12.444 --> 35:16.214
my husband's business had
a complete loss from a flood.

35:16.314 --> 35:18.416
Oh, no.
And we-- we lost everything.

35:18.516 --> 35:20.585
And Pretty Rugged,
very similar to

35:20.685 --> 35:24.556
when I was talking about
Joshua, kind of rebuilt me as
a person.

35:24.656 --> 35:28.860
And this-- this has been my
journey, and this is my passion,

35:28.960 --> 35:33.898
and that's why it's so
important to me that I do this.

35:33.999 --> 35:38.570
I-I can do this. I need-- I-I
want a strategic partner here.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.573
I want someone who gets this
and understands

35:41.673 --> 35:44.075
and wants to help me
take this to the next level.

35:44.175 --> 35:45.076
How much is
this blanket?

35:45.176 --> 35:46.645
That's $290.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.380
How much is what
Emma was wearing?

35:48.480 --> 35:50.048
That's $220.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.350
So, what does it cost you
to manufacture the blanket,

35:52.450 --> 35:54.386
and then the thing
that I was wearing, the cape?

35:54.486 --> 35:57.822
The blankets cost me
about $36 to $40.

35:57.922 --> 35:58.657
- Wow!
- Whoa!

35:58.757 --> 35:59.658
My margins are huge.

35:59.758 --> 36:00.892
Good margins!
Margin on fire!

36:00.992 --> 36:04.562
My retail margins
hover around 80%.
Whoo-hoo!

36:04.663 --> 36:07.766
Oh, my God!
And my wholesale margins
are 70%.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.835
Oh, delicious.
And I've sold over 30,000 units.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.838
My lifetime sales
are just shy of $3 million.

36:13.938 --> 36:14.906
Wow.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.274
What were your sales
last year?

36:16.374 --> 36:19.344
Yes, last year,
I did $1.197 million.

36:19.444 --> 36:20.779
And what did you
make on that?

36:20.879 --> 36:23.181
I netted $32,000.

36:23.281 --> 36:24.716
What?

36:24.816 --> 36:29.954
If you made 80% margins,
why did you only net $32,000

36:30.055 --> 36:31.956
on $1 million?
Trade shows.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.992
We-- We had another
purchase order last year

36:34.092 --> 36:35.760
that came in
late in the year.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.595
How much did you spend
on trade shows?

36:37.696 --> 36:41.866
Last year, we spent about
$180,000 on trade shows.

36:41.966 --> 36:42.901
Wow.
There we go. Okay.

36:42.967 --> 36:44.035
A lot of trade shows
this year.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.904
I'm doing
20 trade shows this year.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.038
Oh, wow.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.140
Supply-chain issues
have been an issue.

36:49.240 --> 36:53.745
Last year, I ran out of
product, so I made a strategic decision

36:53.845 --> 36:56.981
to make a big purchase order
of about $400,000

36:57.082 --> 36:58.850
that came in
just a couple weeks ago.

36:58.950 --> 37:03.788
Duties-- I-I get knocked 25%
on tariffs from China.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.591
My-- My ad spend
was $68,000.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.093
O'Leary:
I'm listening to your numbers.

37:08.193 --> 37:10.061
It's like you said
just a few moments ago,

37:10.161 --> 37:11.196
you're running around
the country,

37:11.296 --> 37:13.698
spending 20% of revenue
at trade shows.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.633
It's working.
You're selling over $1
million.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.901
That's amazing.

37:17.001 --> 37:20.171
But I'm looking at it as
an investor, saying to myself,

37:20.271 --> 37:22.540
"There's not
any room for me."

37:22.640 --> 37:24.476
I mean,
I give you $200,000 for 10%.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.346
That's a $2 million valuation.
It's not worth $2 million yet.

37:28.446 --> 37:29.881
Could be one day.

37:29.981 --> 37:33.818
But for me, it's just, how do
I pour gasoline on this fire?

37:33.918 --> 37:35.587
Because that's what I do
in my investments.

37:35.687 --> 37:38.757
I-I find a model that's
working, and you need cash,

37:38.857 --> 37:41.259
I have cash,
I give you cash,

37:41.359 --> 37:43.795
you pour it on the business,
we make more cash.

37:43.895 --> 37:46.097
Everybody's happy.
Cash, cash, cash.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.066
And-- But I don't see that
here, Tracy. I'm sorry.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.168
I think you're fantastic,
but I'm out.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.470
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.706
Tracy, I'm-- I'm going
to tell you right now,

37:54.806 --> 37:56.307
I actually
really admire you.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.443
I admire the fact that,
at this point in your life,

37:58.543 --> 38:01.646
you've decided to just take
a chance and do something else.

38:01.746 --> 38:03.648
I'll tell you right now,
I touched this product.

38:03.748 --> 38:05.884
I put it on,
and it feels great.

38:06.017 --> 38:08.486
For me,
working in fashion right now,

38:08.586 --> 38:10.655
it doesn't feel right
to invest in something--

38:10.755 --> 38:12.590
Even though this is not
real fur,

38:12.690 --> 38:14.526
I think we're seeing
a real downtrend

38:14.626 --> 38:16.761
in the trend overall
of fur,

38:16.861 --> 38:18.396
and certainly,
the younger generation

38:18.496 --> 38:19.831
don't want anything
to do with it.

38:19.931 --> 38:24.435
So for that reason,
I'm out.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.304
Tracy, I think
you're going to do great.

38:26.404 --> 38:27.839
I think it's
a great product.
Thank you.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.808
But I'm just not sure
how I can help you.

38:29.908 --> 38:32.110
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.479
Thank you, Mark.
I appreciate that.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.181
Lori? Robert?

38:49.894 --> 38:51.329
Three Sharks are out.

38:51.429 --> 38:54.332
Lori and Robert are Tracy's
last chance for a deal

38:54.432 --> 38:58.069
for her luxury outdoor
accessory business, Pretty Rugged.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.737
So, what are
this year's sales,

38:59.838 --> 39:01.639
and what is the profit
so far on that?

39:01.739 --> 39:04.442
So right now, my booked sales-- my gross sales,

39:04.542 --> 39:07.445
not my preorders,
are $715,000, okay?

39:07.545 --> 39:09.047
So far.
So far.

39:09.147 --> 39:13.117
According to my P&L,
I'm at negative $250,000.

39:13.218 --> 39:14.652
Ooh! Explain.
Wow.

39:14.752 --> 39:17.822
My trade shows-- I did four
trade shows last year.

39:17.922 --> 39:20.692
I'm doing like almost
20 of them this year,

39:20.792 --> 39:22.160
so it's-- it's a lot.

39:22.260 --> 39:25.296
So trade shows can be 5 grand
a show, they can be 10. Yeah.

39:25.396 --> 39:26.397
Or they can be 200.

39:26.497 --> 39:27.966
They can be-- You know,
what are they costing?

39:28.066 --> 39:30.268
So, most of them hover between
$15,000 and $30,000.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.737
So, talk to us about
the last year.
Tracy, is it just you?
Do you have any staff?

39:32.837 --> 39:35.607
Okay, so this is
run by five women.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.909
We are
a women-owned company.

39:38.009 --> 39:40.545
It makes no sense.
It's not a viable business.

39:40.645 --> 39:41.846
Something isn't
stacking up.

39:41.946 --> 39:43.014
The inefficiencies
are crazy,

39:43.114 --> 39:44.916
'cause your margins
are what they are,

39:45.016 --> 39:46.517
and even your wholesale margin
is good.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.053
I know. That's why I'm here. I
need a person that can help me.

39:49.153 --> 39:50.588
I know I'm not doing
everything right.

39:50.688 --> 39:51.789
I'm not saying I am.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.859
Can I learn and know?
Yes, I can.

39:54.959 --> 39:58.863
I'm so good at-- at-- at
selling this product.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.865
Tracy, we just think
you need some help.

40:00.965 --> 40:03.735
I <i>do</i> need help.
Yeah, Tracy, I care-- I care less about the past.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.271
I mean, we all make mistakes.
I wasn't a financial guy.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.640
It took me three days
to do my first spreadsheet.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.576
I mean, y-yes,
you should know that better,

40:11.676 --> 40:13.878
but I think I can
help you figure that out,

40:13.978 --> 40:16.314
and I think there are people
that can figure it out.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.782
You're
an absolute winner.

40:17.882 --> 40:21.519
Like, you are
an absolute winner.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.354
All the poo-poo
that's happened in life,

40:23.454 --> 40:25.890
and you've recovered,
you've kept going.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.392
I mean,
that's what I look for.

40:27.492 --> 40:29.594
Thank you.
I couldn't
love you more.

40:29.694 --> 40:32.297
I want to be
involved with it. Okay.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.832
You know, I'm sitting here
feeling this,

40:34.933 --> 40:36.901
and really beautiful.

40:37.001 --> 40:39.237
You would not know
this isn't mink.
That's right.

40:39.337 --> 40:42.173
I mean, It's just-- I
actually like it way better,
frankly... Yeah.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.777
...because I'm a believer
in faux fur versus real fur.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.011
Yes.
Yes, me too.

40:47.111 --> 40:50.548
And then the inside is just
absolutely gorgeous, too.

40:50.648 --> 40:53.685
Your margins
are fantastic.

40:53.785 --> 40:57.121
You obviously have done
a great job of sourcing.

40:57.221 --> 41:00.558
Yes.
Robert and I both love you
and love the product.

41:00.658 --> 41:03.928
So we thought, you know what,
he can help you

41:04.028 --> 41:06.431
with the financial end of it,
and I can help you

41:06.531 --> 41:08.833
with the sales and marketing
end of it,

41:08.933 --> 41:10.768
and we would make
a good team here.

41:10.868 --> 41:12.403
What's the offer,
before the mink dies?

41:12.503 --> 41:13.571
We are gonna
offer you...

41:13.671 --> 41:15.239
$200,000...

41:15.340 --> 41:17.141
For 25%.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.877
Because we think we add
a lot of value to it, Tracy,

41:19.978 --> 41:21.446
and I think this is
one of those businesses,

41:21.546 --> 41:25.516
you got to go quick--
$200,000, 25%.

41:25.616 --> 41:27.986
Lori and I would love to be
in business with you.

41:28.086 --> 41:28.987
What do you think,
Tracy?

41:29.087 --> 41:31.322
So I'm just going to ask you,

41:31.422 --> 41:34.959
would you ever
consider 20%, not 25%?

41:35.059 --> 41:37.261
No. Tracy, we feel pretty good
about that offer.

41:37.362 --> 41:38.963
Come on.
We're gonna blow this up.

41:39.063 --> 41:40.732
We're gonna blow it up?
We're gonna blow it up!

41:40.832 --> 41:43.401
Alright. You got a deal!

41:43.501 --> 41:44.702
Boom!

41:44.802 --> 41:46.337
Whoo!

41:46.437 --> 41:47.739
Oh, well done, Tracy.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.675
I love it!
I couldn't love it more.

41:50.775 --> 41:54.045
I love it, too.
Wow. It's beautiful.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.480
Congratulations,
Tracy.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.048
Thank you so much.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.449
Okay.

41:58.549 --> 42:01.252
Yes! Oh!

42:01.352 --> 42:04.222
This is the American dream.
This is what I came here for.

42:04.322 --> 42:08.192
I thought that I would get
a Shark, but to get two Sharks,

42:08.292 --> 42:12.597
and to have them see me,
what I really feel,

42:12.697 --> 42:16.968
and-- and love the product
was everything.

42:17.068 --> 42:19.070
You know what another
great thing about this is?

42:19.170 --> 42:22.006
If you have things that you
want to hide from the public--

42:22.106 --> 42:24.776
Ohh!
You can just cover them!

42:24.876 --> 42:25.877
And they look better.
