WEBVTT

01:09.444 --> 01:10.403
You don't hate me.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.944
You're extra friendly.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.196
I'm always friendly.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.208
- What is it?
- Your heart is beating really fast.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.587
Weird.

02:11.047 --> 02:15.635
I... I have to get on the road
by nine. I told Bree I'd be there early.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.263
You sure you don't want me to come?

02:19.305 --> 02:21.933
It's fine. I'm sure
it's going to be boring.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.352
It's going to be more like
a college reunion

02:24.352 --> 02:25.812
than an actual engagement party.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.772
Not really a reunion.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.315
You see your college friends
all the time.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.569
Yeah, some of them.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.706
You're a liability.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.837
Do you still love me?

03:08.354 --> 03:12.442
I promise. I begged Evan not
to invite him today.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.902
Oh, Bree, stop. Stop.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.695
You won't even have to speak to him.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.073
There's gonna be so many people here
and I already told Evan

03:19.199 --> 03:22.744
- to keep him away from you.
- I am fine. Okay?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.996
- Okay.
- I am good. Okay?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.456
- Yes.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.417
Besides, you're doing
so much better than you were back then.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.672
- Yeah.
- Are we talking about Stephen already?

03:35.173 --> 03:38.468
- You look so fucking beautiful!

03:38.593 --> 03:41.221
Oh, I'm so happy you're here.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.431
Hi, Pippa!

03:43.723 --> 03:45.266
- Hi, hi!
- Hi!

03:45.850 --> 03:48.186
- It's been ages!
- Yeah!

03:48.603 --> 03:50.313
Bree! Can you come out here?

03:50.813 --> 03:53.983
Go, it's your cue.
You look so fucking pretty!

03:54.234 --> 03:55.276
So, so pretty.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.246
Do you want me to do it?

04:08.998 --> 04:09.916
Yeah.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.296
You still seeing that architect?

04:15.421 --> 04:16.839
Oh, no. That ended.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.093
I mean, I don't know how
I'd prioritize another person right now.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.512
- Yeah. I mean, it's just time management.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.890
Time management?
Don't make it sound so sexy, Lucy.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.643
- Pervert.
- No, I'm just saying. I... I make it work.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.812
Speaking of, is Max coming today?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.689
No. No, he couldn't make it.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.942
Yeah. It's probably smart
to keep him away today.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.696
I really wanted him to come.
He just had work.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.034
Okay, I'm... I'm just gonna say this once
and then I'm going to drop it.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.412
I really hope that you can avoid
going down the whole

04:47.537 --> 04:50.873
- Stephen rabbit hole today.
- Jesus Christ, there's no rabbit hole.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.875
It's been four years.

04:53.042 --> 04:58.339
I can handle seeing him for two hours
at a fucking engagement luncheon thing.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.133
Just saying it for Bree's sake.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.427
It's her day, and if ever there were
a time for us

05:02.427 --> 05:05.388
to not be shitty friends to her,
this is her moment.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.641
So let's just subvert expectations,
shall we?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.601
I said it was fine and I meant it.
That's...

05:11.728 --> 05:13.271
- Thank you.
- Yep.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.695
Well, the good news is we can't fuck up
more than we already have.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.281
I don't want to talk about it. Any of it.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.629
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

05:38.755 --> 05:39.881
Good to see you.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.303
- Whoo!

05:45.428 --> 05:46.512
It's good!

05:46.888 --> 05:47.972
So beautiful!

05:48.806 --> 05:51.142
- I love you.
- I hope so.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.689
- So, Lucy, how...
- It's the fucking bride!

05:57.982 --> 05:59.359
- I'm stealing your wife!
- Wrigley!

05:59.359 --> 06:00.610
- No.
- I am stealing your wife!

06:00.777 --> 06:03.488
- All right, all right.
- Wrigley!

06:03.863 --> 06:06.074
You know, it's a very
fancy dancy party we got here, huh?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.450
- Fancy dancy? Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.160
Hey, Lucy!

06:09.327 --> 06:11.412
- Hey, Wrigley.
- Oh! You're looking good.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.123
- Aw, thanks.
- Looking so good. And bring it in!

06:14.540 --> 06:17.919
- The bride gets an extra hug.
- Oh! Thank you.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.714
Dude, are you high?

06:21.881 --> 06:22.882
Am I what?

06:23.132 --> 06:24.258
No.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.887
Don't tell Pippa.
Where is Pippa by the way? She here?

06:28.679 --> 06:30.014
I think she...

06:30.098 --> 06:31.599
I don't know if she's come in yet, actually.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.017
- I mean...
- She is right there. See her?

06:33.101 --> 06:34.644
Hey! Pippa!

06:34.769 --> 06:35.686
Wrigley, just...

06:35.812 --> 06:37.230
- Pippa!
- Don't harass her, please.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.857
Wrigley, walk. Walk, please.
What a child.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.276
- You're so mean, Lucy.
- What are you talking about?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.570
It's like every girl's dream
to be chased around a party

06:44.695 --> 06:45.738
by a coked-up gorilla.

06:45.822 --> 06:49.659
It was his brother's birthday yesterday.
So, maybe take it easy on him.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.748
Sorry. Sorry.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.042
I'll be right back. Love you.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.086
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.840
- Thanks for the heads up, guys.
- You two have a good catch-up?

07:04.006 --> 07:06.884
Yeah, it's funny unless you're the one
who has to clean up his mess.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.970
You don't have to clean up
his mess anymore.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.389
I should go help Evan with Wrigley.

07:11.806 --> 07:12.765
Hey!

07:14.100 --> 07:17.520
You know I'm really,
really happy for you, right?

07:18.229 --> 07:21.399
Yeah. Yeah, of course, I know that. Weirdo.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.838
I can keep a secret.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.180
I wish I could fuck you all day.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.936
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.404
You don't hate me.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.100
I... I just don't think it makes sense
to start college

08:38.226 --> 08:40.186
in a long-distance relationship.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.856
Why wouldn't you tell me that sooner,
like, instead of the day that you leave?

08:44.482 --> 08:47.151
Because I'm an avoidant asshole.
I don't... I don't know.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.404
What is wrong with you?
You don't even seem upset.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.407
What? I... I don't know what
you want me to say.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.701
I'm sorry I'm not, like,
upset enough for you.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.829
I... Well, I am upset, I just...

08:58.913 --> 09:02.083
No, you're, like, fucking broken inside.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.797
<i>Do you think I'm broken inside?</i>

09:07.964 --> 09:11.259
No, you... you're just
not a feelings girl.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.470
Not that you don't have feelings,

09:14.554 --> 09:17.223
- just that they're not very visible.
- Okay, just stop talking, please.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.183
Don't worry.
Someday, some guy is gonna get

09:19.308 --> 09:22.770
so far your under your skin,
he's gonna rot there. And I'm gonna laugh.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.022
- Ah! Lydia, hi!
- Hi!

09:25.189 --> 09:26.190
How are you?

09:26.315 --> 09:28.943
I'm good! But your daughter
might be a sociopath.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.737
- I don't get it.
- It's nothing. It's a joke.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.576
No, I... I broke up with Parker.
That's it.

09:37.910 --> 09:38.786
Just now?

09:38.786 --> 09:39.912
- Yeah, it's not...
- Why?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.122
It's not a big deal. It's fine.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.665
Well, I just...
I just don't understand.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.624
I'm sure Lucy knows

09:43.708 --> 09:46.419
- what's best for her, Mom.
- I know but... but you love Parker.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.670
Can we not talk about it?

09:50.131 --> 09:54.176
Well, I'm gonna go,
but call me from campus?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.177
All right. Yes!

09:55.344 --> 09:57.346
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you.

09:59.932 --> 10:03.060
So, have you given any more thought
to... signing up

10:03.144 --> 10:04.270
for some business classes?

10:04.687 --> 10:06.647
It's not really necessary
for an English degree.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.358
Yeah, but, I don't know, as a backup?

10:09.817 --> 10:12.486
You don't go very far doing
the bare minimum.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.364
That's what your dad used to say to you.
Do you remember that?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.241
Yeah, but Dad was talking
about high school.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.411
Everyone does extra stuff in high school
so they can get into college.

10:20.411 --> 10:24.290
But, I am in college now.
I don't need to impress anyone anymore.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.042
Oh, I don't know if I'd go that far.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.461
Well, I'm aware we have different opinions
on the subject.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.795
Oh, what subject is that?

10:30.254 --> 10:31.547
Impressing people.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.716
I do not appreciate that comment.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.926
Well, I don't appreciate you
bringing Dad up every time

10:36.135 --> 10:38.262
I don't comply
with your exact expectations.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.764
Well, I'm trying to help.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.682
And I have no idea...

10:43.392 --> 10:44.935
what happened to the sweet girl

10:45.102 --> 10:48.189
that you used to be.
But, speaking of your dad,

10:48.397 --> 10:51.609
if he saw how much you've changed,
he would be very disappointed.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.701
Yeah. Guess I'm not as nice
as I used to be.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.244
Of course, you're nice.

11:04.705 --> 11:09.794
Hopefully, college will be good for you.
Maybe we just need a little space.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.229
Hi!

12:12.064 --> 12:14.150
Hey! I'm Macy.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.485
Are you my roommate?

12:16.819 --> 12:19.530
I think I must be. I'm... I'm Lucy.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.407
Hey!

12:23.951 --> 12:26.203
- Hi!
- I've been so excited to meet you.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.997
Yeah, you, too!

12:28.330 --> 12:30.332
Is it cool if I hang some posters?

12:30.624 --> 12:35.296
No, that's great. I forgot to bring
anything like that, so, yes, please.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.133
Hey, where are you from?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.136
- Bayville. It's on Long Island.
- Yeah, I know Bayville.

12:42.136 --> 12:45.097
I live 20 minutes from there.
I'm from... I'm from Cold Spring Harbor.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.348
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.852
I drive through there all the time!
It's nice.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.021
It's so boring.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.941
- We're back!

12:56.066 --> 12:57.401
Oh! Your roommate's here.

12:57.526 --> 12:58.444
- Hi!
- Hi!

12:58.569 --> 12:59.987
This is Pippa and Bree
from across the hall.

12:59.987 --> 13:00.988
Hi.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.157
Yeah, so we're gonna be
bothering you nonstop.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.575
I'm Lucy.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.161
Oh, who brought the booze?

13:07.536 --> 13:11.081
Oh, that is a parting gift from my mom.
Along with the cookies.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.083
This is nice champagne.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.543
Yeah, it's bribery.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.921
I need caffeine. Let's go.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.631
There's a bunch of parties tonight.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.716
They all sound pretty good,
except apparently we don't wanna

13:20.800 --> 13:22.927
go to Gamma Pi
because they're kind of rapey.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.429
- Kind of rapey, how?
- Like they rape people.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.306
Oh, and then Saturday,
there's the bonfire

13:27.431 --> 13:29.350
which everybody goes to.
So that should be pretty good.

13:29.558 --> 13:33.395
And I don't know...
Oh, my God! You scared me!

13:33.729 --> 13:35.898
Sorry, that's my signature move.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.733
This is my...

13:39.276 --> 13:40.611
- Hi.
- Hi!

13:40.903 --> 13:45.032
Okay, this is my roommate, Bree,
and my friends, Macy and Lucy.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.784
- Hey.
- I'm Wrigley.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.038
We met when I toured campus last year.
Wrigley's a junior.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.249
Oh, and my... and my friends and I
are having a party tonight.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.542
You guys should come.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.585
- Yeah.
- Maybe there's a few parties...

13:56.794 --> 13:58.379
Yeah, but ours is the only good one.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.172
I said maybe.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.926
Yeah. All right, I better get back
to my friends.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.678
Uh...

14:06.136 --> 14:08.264
Bu I'm gonna blow up your phone.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.306
Great.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.100
It was a pleasure meeting all of you.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.351
Good seeing you again.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.603
All right. See you tonight.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.529
- See ya.
- See ya.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.409
He's, like, the top football player,
and we've only hooked up once.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.994
But we've been texting all summer.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.288
He's definitely gonna be
my first-semester guy.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.374
I like having a plan!

14:40.588 --> 14:44.300
I'm not sure about this top. Is it...
is it making me look too, like...?

14:44.425 --> 14:49.054
Like a person wearing a low-cut top,
but who's actually still a virgin? Yes.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.892
I got her to admit it within minutes
of meeting. I could just tell.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.727
I'm, like, kind of a witch like that.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.896
Everyone from California
thinks they're kind of a witch.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.356
I'm serious! I can always tell.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.733
Like,

15:01.233 --> 15:02.943
I can tell that Lucy isn't a virgin.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.406
- Okay, I'm not.
- Yes!

15:08.908 --> 15:12.453
Honestly, like,
I'm just so ready to lose it.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.624
I'm not, like, sentimental about it.
I just want to get it over with.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.959
I don't know how you managed
to go to boarding school

15:19.084 --> 15:20.294
and stay a virgin.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.212
All of my friends
who went to boarding school

15:22.338 --> 15:24.048
just got drunk and had sex all the time.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.925
Oh, I was on financial aid,
so I had to make sure

15:26.050 --> 15:29.428
that I kept my shit together.
I'm still on financial aid, actually.

15:29.803 --> 15:33.641
Okay, so we know Macy's boy situation.
What's your deal, Lucy?

15:34.391 --> 15:38.646
Oh, I actually just broke up
with my boyfriend this morning.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.813
Oh, dude.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.442
No, no, no, it's not...
it's not like that, I'm... I'm not upset.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.194
Were you not together very long?

15:45.194 --> 15:46.278
Two years.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.783
I know, I know.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.284
I should be more upset,
but honestly,

15:52.368 --> 15:54.244
I think I only started dating him
because all my friends

15:54.370 --> 15:58.040
were getting boyfriends and I just really
wanted to like somebody.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.836
So, you dated for two years,
but you didn't like him?

16:04.254 --> 16:06.507
I don't know. I'm... I'm honestly
just not someone

16:06.674 --> 16:08.759
who gets very excited about things.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.719
You don't get excited about things?

16:11.470 --> 16:12.513
You mean like ever?

16:13.681 --> 16:14.598
No.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.016
I...

16:16.642 --> 16:17.726
Well, it's like...

16:18.185 --> 16:22.106
It's like when you were a kid, you know,
and... and everything seems super exciting

16:22.106 --> 16:25.317
and fun and... and now,
you just feel like everything

16:25.442 --> 16:28.570
is just kind of, like, steady, you know?

16:29.029 --> 16:32.032
Unless it's just totally overwhelming,
you know?

16:37.162 --> 16:39.456
Maybe I'm just a freak
who needs some water.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.215
I hate all the stuff I brought.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.843
I feel like I left all my fun stuff
at home.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.511
Do you wanna borrow something?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.930
Yes! Can I? Please?

16:55.431 --> 16:57.266
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you!

16:57.641 --> 16:59.643
Yeah, I'll grab a few things.
I'll be back.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.922
Evan and I were roommates freshman year.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.216
But now, we're just soulmates
who don't live together.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.469
No one can live with Wrigley
longer than one year.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.387
- That's a fucking lie!
- That's the fucking truth!

17:35.512 --> 17:37.931
- That's why I don't live with you anymore.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.975
Whoa! Hey!
You just went, like, ten minutes ago.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.060
Why are you keeping track?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.062
'Cause you're trying to pretend
like you're not doing coke.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.480
Do I seriously look like I'm doing coke?

17:44.605 --> 17:47.274
Oh, they do this every time we drink.
Evan can't function unless

17:47.399 --> 17:49.359
he has a girlfriend
ruining his fucking life.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.944
He seems nice.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.322
Oh, yeah, he's stupid rich.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.992
Not that that's important,
but his family is, like, fucking loaded.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.119
Hey! Hey, Drew!

18:01.246 --> 18:03.332
Move aside. Clear the way.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.417
Oh, big bro-y!

18:06.960 --> 18:08.295
Ow! Ow!

18:10.172 --> 18:11.548
- This is my little brother, Drew.
- Hi!

18:11.715 --> 18:13.634
- Hi.
- Did you come by yourself?

18:14.009 --> 18:16.887
Yeah. Yeah, you said I,
I couldn't bring my roommate, right?

18:17.012 --> 18:19.431
- Yeah, you can't. He's a freshman.
- Wait, are freshmen not allowed here?

18:19.515 --> 18:22.392
No, freshman guys aren't allowed.
Unless you're my little brother...

18:23.185 --> 18:24.144
Mm!

18:24.728 --> 18:25.771
Who one of you should date!

18:26.146 --> 18:28.690
- Dude, stop.
- Aw, come on! He's the smarter brother.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.526
He's gonna go a lot further than I am.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.279
Hi.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.614
Good night?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.866
- Yep.
- Do you want a shot?

18:37.991 --> 18:39.993
- Yeah. Yes, immediately.
- Yes.

18:41.161 --> 18:45.082
More coming. Yeah, just open your throat,
come on! Hell yeah.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.221
They literally only invited
freshman girls.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.140
This is depressing.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.308
I told you it would be.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.812
I need to pee, and then
can we please leave?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.481
I'm not hanging around a bunch
of 18-year-old whores

19:09.565 --> 19:11.275
just so you can spy on your ex.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.986
Just go pee, then we can leave.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.493
Sorry, about
the "18-year-old whores" comment.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.829
It's all good, I'm not a whore, so...

19:25.956 --> 19:26.957
I'm Diana.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.959
I'm Lucy.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.254
So, who invited you here?

19:33.338 --> 19:34.923
Um, this guy, Wrigley.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.801
Oh, God. Be careful with him.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.388
Nice meeting you.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.432
Y... You, too.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.331
You look really uncomfortable
in that dress.

20:08.957 --> 20:09.917
I'm sorry?

20:10.834 --> 20:13.587
I'm not saying you should be uncomfortable
in that dress.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.548
You actually look very good in it.
Excuse me. I'm just pointing out

20:16.715 --> 20:18.342
that you do look uncomfortable
in that dress.

20:18.926 --> 20:19.927
Who are you?

20:20.093 --> 20:24.431
- I'm Stephen DeMarco. What's your name?
- Ah. I'm Lucy Albright.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.351
Lucy?
Like my favorite song.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.187
- What song?
-"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."

20:30.437 --> 20:33.857
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"?
That's your favorite song? Really?

20:33.982 --> 20:35.692
It'd be really cute if it was,
wouldn't it?

20:36.526 --> 20:39.571
- Bet you'd fucking love that.
- You're Wrigley's friend, right?

20:40.072 --> 20:40.948
Yes,

20:41.323 --> 20:43.450
I'm... I'm Wrigley's friend.
Where are you from?

20:43.951 --> 20:44.952
From Westchester?

20:45.077 --> 20:48.205
- No! I'm not from Westchester. Why?
- You're not? Where, then?

20:49.331 --> 20:51.625
- Cold Spring Harbor.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.628
Really? That's... that might as well
be Westchester.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.838
No, no, it's very different,
very different actually.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.757
- Oh. Cold Spring Harbor.
- Yeah.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.218
I know all about you.
That makes so much sense.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.553
Cable knit sweaters, good at tennis.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.598
You just described half the East Coast.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.934
I'm assuming you borrowed that dress.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.940
I actually hate Cold Spring Harbor.
I don't even really fit in there, so...

21:15.065 --> 21:17.693
Yeah. You don't seem as uptight
as the girls there.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.237
And I'm not just saying that
'cause you're gorgeous.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.781
- Right. Right.
- That's a compliment.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.991
- Well...
- Relax.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.575
Not all the girls there are uptight.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.369
But if you don't fit in with them,

21:27.369 --> 21:28.912
then why does that observation
bother you?

21:29.037 --> 21:30.330
- It doesn't bother me.
- Good.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.250
Good.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.127
Besides, you know...

21:35.127 --> 21:37.838
I think uptight people are usually
just people

21:38.005 --> 21:39.214
who aren't getting fucked well.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.053
How are you expecting me
to respond to that?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.014
You know, I actually make a good point.
Think about that.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.807
Think about the first time
you finally had good sex.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.685
That changes a person.
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.772
Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe you don't?

21:56.356 --> 21:58.817
Is this... Is this how you talk
to everyone you've just met?

21:59.276 --> 22:00.736
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Wow.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.737
Yeah, I know.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.281
And what's the general reaction?

22:05.449 --> 22:06.908
Like what's people's first impression
of me?

22:07.200 --> 22:08.243
Sure.

22:10.871 --> 22:11.872
I'm pretty polarizing.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.502
Is that your real laugh?
Is that an actual laugh?

22:20.547 --> 22:22.299
I think the best laugh I've ever heard.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.764
And I'm... I'm... sure you know
this already,

22:29.181 --> 22:32.559
but you are killing me in that dress.

22:33.643 --> 22:34.644
Really.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.438
Stephen fucking DeMarco!

22:36.897 --> 22:40.442
Hey! Macy! How are you?

22:41.151 --> 22:43.653
- You guys know each other?
- We're both from Bayville.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.364
Well, Macy's from the nicer part.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.158
- Told you I know Cold Spring Harbor.
- Ah.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.369
I'm Pippa, and this is Bree.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.080
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Think I'm gonna take off soon.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.664
What? It's not even 12.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.042
Well, I'll stay out.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.544
Are there any other parties happening?

22:59.669 --> 23:01.713
Yeah, actually,
there's something happening in my dorm.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.131
M... My roommate's there, but...

23:03.382 --> 23:04.925
- Cool.
- Yeah, if I wanted to hang out

23:05.050 --> 23:07.969
with a bunch of freshmen dudes.
I mean...

23:08.595 --> 23:10.263
Well, I wouldn't want to do that,
is the point.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.681
I will go with you, Bree.

23:12.265 --> 23:14.351
Me, too. I'm down for whatever.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.645
Guys, hanging out
in a freshman dorm

23:16.770 --> 23:19.189
your first night on campus, it's,
like, making an active decision

23:19.314 --> 23:20.399
not to have a good time.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.150
- Sorry.
- Bye.

23:22.776 --> 23:23.985
Be careful, okay?

23:25.320 --> 23:26.405
You, too.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.338
I have to eat bread when I'm hungover.
Don't judge me.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.216
Drew?

23:46.967 --> 23:49.261
We're totally gonna be
roommates dating a pair of brothers.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.387
Very kinky.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.347
My God. We didn't even kiss.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.766
Yeah, but he was flirting with you
or at least I think

23:54.850 --> 23:57.352
- he thought he was flirting with you.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.605
Lucy, that guy, Stephen,
is really into you.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.524
He told Wrigley.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.235
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.780
I don't know if he's my type.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.991
You don't know what your type is.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.285
You said you've never been
excited about a guy before.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.539
Okay, so what is he like, Macy?

24:18.373 --> 24:20.459
I don't know him that well.
He went to public school.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.253
He seems nice enough, I guess.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.589
I don't know. He seems a little rude.

24:25.755 --> 24:28.008
It's weird. I thought he was cute
when I was talking to him,

24:28.008 --> 24:30.469
but now that he's not in front of me
and I'm, like, picturing his face,

24:30.469 --> 24:33.722
- I don't... I don't really know.
- Yeah, I think that's called charm.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.390
I'm... I'm gonna go get a salad.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.225
Why are you trying to make me
feel bad about myself?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.226
I am not.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.233
- Pippa's funny.
- Yeah.

24:46.067 --> 24:49.196
You know, I actually taught tennis
in Cold Spring Harbor last summer.

24:49.362 --> 24:50.322
No way.

24:50.530 --> 24:53.700
- Yeah, I'm surprised we never met.
- I am honestly terrible at tennis.

24:53.950 --> 24:54.826
I'm bad at, like...

24:56.036 --> 24:57.954
organized fun in general.

24:58.955 --> 25:02.125
Well, if I'm there again next summer,
I'll give you a lesson.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.794
Thanks. Actually,
I'll... I'll be in India next summer.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.380
How have you already planned
your summer?

25:07.464 --> 25:09.299
It's this trip I've had planned for ages.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.968
My dad went the summer
after his freshman year,

25:12.093 --> 25:14.763
and he always talked about how it was
the most formative summer of his life.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.432
So, I'm gonna go and follow
the same itinerary as him

25:17.516 --> 25:20.018
and go to all the same places
he told me about.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.479
That thing you said last night,

25:24.523 --> 25:26.525
how you have trouble
getting excited about stuff.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.569
Oh, yeah, I was drunk. I don't know.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.821
I know what you meant, though.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.325
Sometimes it feels like I'm...

25:36.284 --> 25:38.995
watching
other people experience things.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.540
Yeah.

25:44.501 --> 25:45.752
Yeah, that's exactly...

25:48.505 --> 25:50.674
I'm really glad you're my roommate.

25:51.716 --> 25:52.717
Me, too.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.096
Okay.

25:56.846 --> 26:00.016
Can I tell you something
that's sort of secret

26:00.600 --> 26:02.644
- and sort of embarrassing?
- Yeah, of course. What?

26:03.186 --> 26:05.689
- So...

26:05.939 --> 26:07.816
Sorry, I don't...
I don't know who this is. I mean...

26:08.650 --> 26:09.651
- Yeah.
- Hello?

26:09.651 --> 26:11.820
<i>Hey! How's your day going?</i>

26:12.445 --> 26:15.323
- Who... who is this?
<i>- It's Stephen... DeMarco.</i>

26:16.449 --> 26:18.326
Oh. Hi.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.328
<i>Did you go to the freshman thing?
How was it?</i>

26:20.412 --> 26:22.622
<i>Anyone bring their guitar?
Please tell me someone did.</i>

26:22.914 --> 26:24.332
Ho... How did you get my number?

26:24.749 --> 26:26.585
<i>Oh, Pippa gave it to Wrigley.</i>

26:26.710 --> 26:29.838
<i>Listen, I was thinking
we should have dinner this week.</i>

26:30.505 --> 26:33.133
Wha... what at,
like, the dining hall?

26:33.675 --> 26:36.094
<i>No, Lucy, at an actual restaurant,
like an actual date.</i>

26:38.805 --> 26:40.849
C... Can I think about it?

26:42.434 --> 26:45.103
<i>It's not complicated.
It's... it's... it's dinner.</i>

26:46.229 --> 26:47.689
Okay. Let's just...

26:48.607 --> 26:50.358
Let's play it by ear. I have to go.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.028
<i>Okay, yeah, me too. Bye, Lucy.</i>

26:53.153 --> 26:54.070
Bye.

26:59.826 --> 27:02.370
I mean, she's gonna have
to make the first move.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.747
That's... He's not...

27:04.372 --> 27:06.583
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.340
Fuck off, you guys!

27:14.132 --> 27:16.718
This is so exciting, we love you!

27:24.726 --> 27:26.936
- Who's CJ?
- My mom.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.147
Why do you call your mom CJ?

27:30.357 --> 27:31.691
Because it's her name,

27:31.816 --> 27:34.069
and she lost the privilege
of being called "Mom."

27:35.737 --> 27:38.531
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.994
(OVER PHONE) <i>Hey, it's Mom.
Just calling to check in.</i>

27:43.953 --> 27:46.456
<i>I'm not sure why you got so upset
with me yesterday,</i>

27:46.623 --> 27:49.292
<i>but if it has to do with your dad,
I really wish</i>

27:49.417 --> 27:50.627
<i>you wouldn't take that out on me.</i>

27:51.586 --> 27:52.879
<i>He would hate seeing us fight.</i>

27:54.255 --> 27:58.134
<i>Anyway, I hope you're having fun
and I love you so much.</i>

28:06.434 --> 28:09.688
- I do not feel good.
- What do you mean?

28:10.271 --> 28:13.441
I don't know.
I think I just feel a little bit sick.

28:13.608 --> 28:16.444
I think I'm gonna head back to the dorms.

28:16.611 --> 28:18.029
- Are you serious?
- What's wrong?

28:18.154 --> 28:20.699
Yeah, h... it's probably just like
a delayed hangover or something.

28:20.824 --> 28:21.866
I'm fine, though.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.159
I can come with.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.328
No, no, it's fine. Just...
I'll see you guys back in the dorm.

28:32.836 --> 28:33.878
Hey!

28:34.838 --> 28:36.715
- Hey.
- You okay?

28:36.881 --> 28:38.174
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.303
What happened before?

28:44.681 --> 28:46.141
I don't really wanna talk about it.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.268
Okay.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.104
Well, do you wanna come out?

28:52.147 --> 28:53.523
There's a party off campus.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.775
I have my car.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.485
I'll be the boring designated driver.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.446
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
stay in tonight.

28:59.571 --> 29:03.450
- Oh, come on! Don't make me go alone.
- Well, where... where are Bree and Pippa?

29:03.616 --> 29:04.909
They ran off with boys.

29:05.618 --> 29:07.704
- Please?
- I already said I'm staying in tonight.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.372
It's not cool to guilt me, okay?

29:09.789 --> 29:12.333
No, I... I didn't mean to guilt you.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.503
It's fine.

29:16.546 --> 29:17.630
Get some rest.

29:18.298 --> 29:21.176
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah. Thank you. Have fun.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.013
Did you try calling her?

30:07.222 --> 30:08.807
Yeah. She didn't respond.

30:09.432 --> 30:11.726
She probably hooked up with someone.
It's still early.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.061
Yeah. That's true.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.317
- So, you knew her?
- Yeah.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.737
See, like, I don't know what
sign up for...

30:22.862 --> 30:26.074
- Yeah. I'm like, there's so many options.
- Like, running around and shit.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.784
- No, we shouldn't do that.
- We shouldn't do that.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.286
- Yeah, that would be. Hey!
- Hey!

30:31.037 --> 30:32.163
You guys...

30:32.914 --> 30:34.082
What's going on?

30:34.999 --> 30:36.501
Did you not hear what happened?

30:38.211 --> 30:39.337
About Macy?

30:40.338 --> 30:41.756
What? What are you talking about?

30:42.799 --> 30:44.884
Macy got in an accident last night.

30:46.135 --> 30:48.137
She was driving back from a party.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.931
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

30:53.893 --> 30:54.853
No.

31:01.734 --> 31:02.735
Hey.

31:03.486 --> 31:04.529
Thank you.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.531
So I guess somebody found her body
this morning.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.409
She ran into a tree and they're saying
she might have been drunk.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.662
Hey, you good?

31:12.662 --> 31:15.081
Yeah. Yeah, I just need to breathe
for a second.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.631
Whose call are you screening?
Is that an ex or something?

31:23.798 --> 31:25.633
Can you mind your own business?
What is wrong with you?

31:25.800 --> 31:26.843
Yeah...

31:28.970 --> 31:30.805
Are you sure you're okay
to sleep here tonight?

31:31.431 --> 31:33.933
- You could stay with us.
- No. I... I just, like...

31:34.267 --> 31:38.146
How did she seem, when you saw her last,
like before she went out?

31:39.939 --> 31:42.108
She asked me to go to a party with her.
I said no.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.614
Yeah, but that's not your fault.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.366
- No. I know, I know.
- Here.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.119
Let me show you this trick.

31:54.871 --> 31:58.082
It's this thing I learned
to calm your nervous system

31:58.166 --> 32:00.043
when something bad happens.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.212
It's a technique they teach you
in trauma recovery.

32:03.588 --> 32:07.759
Sorry, I... I don't really buy
into the self-help stuff.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.136
When were you in trauma recovery?

32:11.262 --> 32:12.305
I wasn't.

32:13.139 --> 32:15.016
- Oh.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.893
Here.

32:18.728 --> 32:21.397
Oh, they're turning
the bonfire tonight into, like, a vigil.

32:22.565 --> 32:25.026
- I mean, we'll only go if you want to.
- No, we should go.

32:25.526 --> 32:26.569
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we should go.

32:26.653 --> 32:27.528
Okay.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.620
Is she the first person
you know who's died?

32:36.037 --> 32:37.080
Nope.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.208
Is this song even about somebody dying?

32:41.209 --> 32:44.128
I... I don't know. Dude,
I didn't know Drew was here.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.261
Did you guys talk today?

32:52.720 --> 32:54.889
Not really. I... I mean,

32:55.431 --> 32:56.766
I... texted him, but...

32:56.891 --> 32:58.851
Okay, they made out yesterday.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.895
Is your little brother
being a dick right now?

33:00.979 --> 33:02.105
Can I... get some of that?

33:02.230 --> 33:03.898
- What the hell?
- Pippa, stop. It's not a big deal.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.316
- Yo, what's up?
- Oh, what's up, Tim?

33:05.483 --> 33:06.359
Yo, buddy.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.154
- Tim's in IU.
- Nice to meet you.

33:12.782 --> 33:13.950
You're pretty.

33:15.868 --> 33:18.079
- So dark, right?
- Yeah.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.832
We're going to Copeland after this.
Wanna come?

33:21.457 --> 33:23.751
Uh, I don't know.
Is it weird going to a party after this?

33:23.876 --> 33:25.044
I'd go.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.839
What? It's 8:00 p.m.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.133
We can still be sad
and not go straight to bed.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.510
Yeah, honestly, I would love to get drunk.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.729
- Are you okay?
- Can't help it.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.148
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:32.403 --> 34:33.571
Hey, there.

34:35.698 --> 34:36.783
You all right?

34:43.372 --> 34:45.041
Okay, so, no, then.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.088
Get you home?

34:51.255 --> 34:52.340
Yeah? All right.

34:53.299 --> 34:56.594
Up. Up. All right.

34:58.304 --> 34:59.847
I'm not gonna have sex with you.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.725
Yeah. I am completely aware
that's not in the cards tonight.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.690
- You can just do that in the morning.
- I'm brushing my fucking teeth.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.944
Yeah, you're definitely
from Cold Spring Harbor.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.488
You're from Cold Spring Harbor.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.573
I'm not.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.581
This happens to everyone.

35:36.342 --> 35:37.385
Hey.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.096
- You're okay.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.725
It's okay. It's okay.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.438
Hey, hey, hey.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.528
People don't think I'm nice anymore.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.199
People don't think you're nice anymore?

36:07.456 --> 36:10.001
People don't always think I'm nice.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.090
Let's get you under the covers.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.094
There we go.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.691
Will you stay with me?

36:36.652 --> 36:38.905
Just to sleep. I... I... I really don't...

36:40.865 --> 36:42.909
I really don't want to be in here alone.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.331
Are you sure that you want me to?

36:50.333 --> 36:51.375
Yeah.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.297
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.512
Hey.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.559
I'm so sorry. This is...

37:51.519 --> 37:53.020
so mortifying.

37:55.064 --> 37:58.109
You don't have to worry about it.
I'm just glad some creep didn't find you.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.904
- Oh, honestly, just fucking kill me.
- That's a little dramatic.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.032
It's welcome week.
This is actually pretty routine.

38:08.202 --> 38:10.371
- Hey.

38:11.956 --> 38:15.543
- Relax.
- I'm... I'm sorry I was a bitch yesterday.

38:16.585 --> 38:17.503
I...

38:18.713 --> 38:22.133
I was really fucked up about Macy
and I...

38:23.759 --> 38:25.428
I didn't know how to...

38:26.387 --> 38:29.098
I know I barely knew her,
but, I s... still, I just...

38:29.557 --> 38:32.351
Oh, yeah. I saw her around town sometimes.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.188
I didn't know much about her.
She seemed cool, though.

38:36.897 --> 38:39.734
Yeah. I was sort of mean to her,
the last time I saw her.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.655
Who... who was calling you yesterday?

38:46.991 --> 38:48.326
That was my mom.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.370
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.206
You seemed pretty upset.

38:54.957 --> 38:57.585
Yeah, she's... she's upsetting.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.003
How so?

38:59.879 --> 39:01.005
She's just...

39:02.131 --> 39:03.591
not a good person.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.056
She did something really fucked up, and

39:10.848 --> 39:13.851
I... I can't really forgive her
for it. I've tried.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.771
Mm. My mom's difficult, too.

39:18.647 --> 39:19.607
Really?

39:22.068 --> 39:23.652
And I... I don't even talk to my dad.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.614
He left when I was six.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.241
Didn't want to take care of a family.

39:30.242 --> 39:32.411
And my mom was so broke

39:32.620 --> 39:34.705
that we got evicted from...

39:35.623 --> 39:37.541
three places in two years.

39:40.961 --> 39:43.422
Yeah, he doesn't... he doesn't talk
to us anymore.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.301
I'm sorry, that's...

39:51.430 --> 39:53.808
You know what would probably
make me feel better,

39:55.017 --> 39:58.479
is if you let me take you to dinner.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.943
- God!
- It would ease the pain.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.486
You still want to take me to dinner?

40:05.611 --> 40:07.780
Are you sure, after watching me
puke in a bush?

40:08.989 --> 40:12.701
- Yeah. You cried hysterically, too.
- Wow. Oh, no!

40:14.662 --> 40:15.913
You puked and cried.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.542
But I think, yeah,
I think I can get over it.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.380
- God!
- You're insanely pretty.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.173
Okay.

40:26.465 --> 40:30.928
And I guess your personality seems
kind of cool, too.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.303
Should we lock the door?

41:15.014 --> 41:16.807
Actually can we...

41:18.142 --> 41:20.019
Sorry, do you mind if we just,

41:20.478 --> 41:22.605
maybe just leave it there for today?

41:23.606 --> 41:24.940
If that's okay.

41:27.693 --> 41:28.694
Yeah.

41:29.945 --> 41:31.614
- Yeah.
- I was gonna say the same...

41:32.698 --> 41:33.616
thing.

41:36.869 --> 41:37.870
Okay.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.706
Thank you for...

41:41.665 --> 41:45.085
- helping me.
- No, yeah. Of course.

41:47.796 --> 41:49.173
- Get rest.
- I...

41:50.633 --> 41:51.675
Yeah.

41:52.134 --> 41:53.636
And hydrate.

42:28.128 --> 42:29.088
Hey.

42:32.466 --> 42:33.634
Can we talk?

42:36.136 --> 42:37.471
Yeah. Of course, we can talk.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.431
I've been trying to talk to you all week.

42:57.616 --> 42:58.826
Where you coming from?

42:59.577 --> 43:01.078
I passed out at Wrigley's.

43:03.163 --> 43:04.331
You can ask him.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.292
Smoked too much, fell asleep.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.836
That's what happens when
I don't do blow. You should be happy.

43:11.088 --> 43:13.674
I... don't know
what I'm doing here.

43:14.383 --> 43:16.719
Maybe you miss me.

43:17.928 --> 43:18.929
I know I miss you.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.806
I'm still fucking mad at you.

43:21.056 --> 43:22.975
And seeing you flirt
with all these freshmen

43:22.975 --> 43:24.310
makes me want to stab my eyes out.

43:24.310 --> 43:26.312
Oh, God. You broke up with me.

43:26.812 --> 43:28.731
I spent the last two months
telling you that I love you.

43:28.731 --> 43:29.982
The ball's in your court.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.027
I don't trust you. You fucked it up.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.696
I don't want to have to constantly worry
that you're gonna cheat again.

43:36.113 --> 43:38.324
I told you so many times,
that was a one-time thing.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.368
I was completely wasted.
You know that I would never do that again.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.538
I don't understand throwing away
two years over one night.

43:44.705 --> 43:45.914
That makes no sense to me.

43:47.249 --> 43:49.418
Have you hooked up
with anyone else since we broke up?

43:51.587 --> 43:53.130
I haven't wanted to, no.

43:58.218 --> 44:01.096
I wish I wanted to.

44:46.392 --> 44:47.768
Are you still on the pill?

44:49.812 --> 44:50.771
Wait!

44:52.523 --> 44:53.857
We shouldn't do this.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.236
Are you kidding?

44:58.404 --> 44:59.738
No? Okay.

45:02.616 --> 45:03.617
Fuck.

45:10.499 --> 45:11.458
Sorry.

45:12.126 --> 45:15.045
I... wasn't expecting that.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.424
I have to...

45:19.174 --> 45:20.968
Whoo... go meet Susie.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.846
Please don't tell anyone about this.

45:25.514 --> 45:26.473
Okay.

45:26.932 --> 45:29.309
I'm just... I'm in a weird headspace.

45:30.394 --> 45:33.731
Everything feels super bleak
since that girl died.

45:34.398 --> 45:35.691
Yeah, it's...

45:36.900 --> 45:38.402
pretty fucking bizarre.

45:40.696 --> 45:42.239
I want to trust you again.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.242
It's just gonna take me a minute.

45:46.744 --> 45:47.745
I understand.

45:48.912 --> 45:50.330
You know that I love you.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.393
Oh, come on.

46:13.937 --> 46:14.938
What?

46:15.063 --> 46:17.191
(OVER PHONE) <i>Hey, dude,
can you get over here right now?</i>

46:17.316 --> 46:18.233
<i>Drew's freaking out.</i>

46:18.317 --> 46:20.277
<i>I don't even know what the fuck
is happening. It's a mess.</i>

46:20.277 --> 46:22.237
- Okay.
<i>- It's about that girl that died, Macy.</i>

46:22.362 --> 46:23.322
Hold on.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.157
<i>Can you just get over here, please?</i>

46:25.449 --> 46:27.326
All right. I'll... Yeah, I'll... I'll be
right there.

46:46.428 --> 46:47.513
Okay.

46:52.559 --> 46:53.644
Tell me what happened.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.816
I think I really fucked up.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.371
You ready?
