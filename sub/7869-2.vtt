11:58.037 --> 12:00.606
Check and mate.

12:00.673 --> 12:02.107
Thank God!

12:02.175 --> 12:04.209
I will never do that again.

12:04.277 --> 12:05.711
Wait a minute, Marge.

12:05.778 --> 12:07.913
Don't you realize
what just happened?

12:07.981 --> 12:10.649
You got to enjoy that bag
for nothing!

12:10.717 --> 12:12.417
We can buy stuff
we can't afford,

12:12.485 --> 12:14.286
temporarily own
the hell out of it,

12:14.354 --> 12:17.389
and then indignantly bring
it back for a full refund.

12:17.457 --> 12:18.390
(chuckling)

12:18.458 --> 12:20.459
Hide a sandwich in this hat.

12:20.526 --> 12:23.028
"Mary Poppins" myself to work
with this umbrella.

12:23.096 --> 12:25.998
Homie, you know what happens
when you push your luck...

12:26.065 --> 12:28.233
Yeah, the luck
lasts longer!

12:28.301 --> 12:32.004
Thanks to the power of returns,
this store is our closet!

12:32.071 --> 12:33.372
(booming laugh)

12:33.439 --> 12:35.140
(worried murmur)

12:35.208 --> 12:37.876
Ooh, a message
from my small business person!

12:37.944 --> 12:39.077
(giggles)

12:39.145 --> 12:41.179
Dear anonymous investor:

12:41.247 --> 12:43.882
Here is my update
on my small business.

12:43.950 --> 12:46.051
(excitedly):
I'm making money fist over face!

12:46.119 --> 12:47.519
Dingus!

12:47.587 --> 12:49.521
Great timing!

12:49.589 --> 12:51.223
Awesome!

12:51.291 --> 12:54.826
No way I can look nerdy
on this bike.

12:54.894 --> 12:57.696
♪ Hot cross buns,
hot cross buns ♪

12:57.764 --> 12:59.498
♪ One a penny, two a penny ♪

12:59.565 --> 13:01.166
♪ Hot cross buns. ♪

13:01.234 --> 13:03.502
And, with the money I'm making,

13:03.569 --> 13:06.004
<i>I can treat my mom
the way she deserves!</i>

13:06.072 --> 13:08.840
This place is so fancy, Nelson.

13:08.908 --> 13:11.843
The ketchup packets
are made of glass.

13:11.911 --> 13:13.645
(humming)

13:13.713 --> 13:15.781
Nelson: Ma, please.
You're not at work.

13:18.518 --> 13:20.252
(doorbell ringing)

13:20.320 --> 13:22.621
Come in. Come in.

13:22.689 --> 13:25.490
Don't wipe
your feet.

13:25.558 --> 13:27.392
Whoa, look at
all this stuff!

13:27.460 --> 13:29.628
Did you find a mouse
head in your Cuppa-Soup?

13:29.696 --> 13:31.330
I wish. (chuckles)

13:31.397 --> 13:33.165
(gasps)
What the hell are you doing?!

13:33.232 --> 13:35.367
With this protective plastic
overlay, I can't tell

13:35.435 --> 13:38.737
if I'm watching an old <i>Seinfeld</i>
or an old <i>Old Christine.</i>

13:38.805 --> 13:41.106
Now, everyone
onto the hot tub.

13:41.174 --> 13:43.542
(humming to himself)

13:43.609 --> 13:45.410
(grunting)

13:45.478 --> 13:47.079
Come on on.

13:47.146 --> 13:48.580
The cardboard's fine.

13:48.648 --> 13:50.382
(chuckles)

13:50.450 --> 13:51.917
Hi, Nelson.

13:51.984 --> 13:53.885
Here again, huh, Lis?

13:53.953 --> 13:55.954
I guess now
that I'm a success,

13:56.022 --> 13:58.090
you want to get
back together with me.

13:58.157 --> 14:00.092
Dolph called it.

14:00.159 --> 14:03.128
No, but there is something
I can't hold back anymore.

14:03.196 --> 14:05.464
I'm your microfinance donor!

14:05.531 --> 14:07.866
You're L-Simpson-Jazzgirl?

14:07.934 --> 14:09.301
Oh, my God.

14:09.369 --> 14:10.602
I owe you everything.

14:10.670 --> 14:12.704
Well, I didn't do this
for thanks,

14:12.772 --> 14:14.539
but if you want
to thank me,

14:14.607 --> 14:17.676
I can stand here and listen
for as long as it takes.

14:17.744 --> 14:18.977
I'm sure
you can.

14:19.045 --> 14:20.679
Lisa, if it weren't for you,

14:20.747 --> 14:23.148
I never would have achieved
the kind of success

14:23.216 --> 14:25.317
that has allowed me
to quit school.

14:25.385 --> 14:27.085
You're quitting school?!

14:27.153 --> 14:29.654
Dropping it like a melon
off an overpass.

14:29.722 --> 14:32.524
But don't you know that people
who don't go to college

14:32.592 --> 14:34.626
make three percent less
than people who do?

14:34.694 --> 14:36.194
Lisa, thanks to you,

14:36.262 --> 14:38.096
and Nobel laureate
Mohammad Yunus,

14:38.164 --> 14:40.732
I can do... this!

14:40.800 --> 14:44.836
Spelling, meet F-Y-R-E.

14:44.904 --> 14:46.037
(gasps, shudders)

14:51.225 --> 14:53.226
Principal Skinner,
I need to convince Nelson

14:53.293 --> 14:54.861
to come back to school.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.629
Seriously? Why?
With Nelson gone,

14:56.697 --> 14:59.365
lunch money's finally making
its way to the cafeteria.

14:59.433 --> 15:02.301
Nurples are returning to
their natural, non-purple hue.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.838
Besides, I hear he's doing quite
well with his bicycle pimpery.

15:05.906 --> 15:09.575
He is. He's paying people
$11 an hour to work for him.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.077
$11 an hour?

15:11.145 --> 15:12.545
That's night watchman money.

15:12.613 --> 15:14.881
Maybe I should have
a chat with him.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.250
Which of these ties
says confidence?

15:17.317 --> 15:18.885
Isn't that a Christmas tie?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.219
It's a conversation starter!

15:20.287 --> 15:22.021
Lisa, this conversation is over.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.290
It's not you I'm trying
to impress, it's Nelson.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.425
I know
he likes the sleeveless look.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.960
Chalmers:
Skinner!

15:28.028 --> 15:32.799
Oh. Oh, so you also heard
about the, uh, $11 an hour.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.534
I heard about it first.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.737
Yes, well, you see
the thing about that is... Blah!

15:40.574 --> 15:41.707
(humming to himself)

15:41.775 --> 15:43.242
Good afternoon.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.278
I'd like to return
this merchandise.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.447
"Wrong size, wrong color,
not asictured,

15:48.515 --> 15:51.217
and other reason
please explain."

15:53.086 --> 15:55.788
Sir, this suitcase has
an airline tag on it,

15:55.856 --> 15:57.890
these ping-pong balls have
been served and volleyed,

15:57.958 --> 15:59.292
and this hot
plate's still warm.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.726
(hissing)

16:00.794 --> 16:03.896
Yes, uh... maybe
I'll just come back

16:03.964 --> 16:05.464
during someone else's shift.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.066
Is Claire working today?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.501
She's a real sucker.

16:08.569 --> 16:11.170
Let me get my supervisor.

16:11.238 --> 16:14.173
Hello, Homer.
(gasps) How do you
know my name?

16:14.241 --> 16:17.610
I'm Chris Hansen
from <i>To Catch a Credit-Whore.</i>

16:17.678 --> 16:20.379
We know you've been returning
used items all over town.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.615
(chuckles):
Oh, it's not what you think...

16:22.683 --> 16:26.052
I came here to warn them-- yes,
to-to warn them about, um...

16:26.119 --> 16:29.155
People like you?
Yes! I mean no!
I mean...

16:29.223 --> 16:30.890
(shrieks)
You'll never get me!

16:32.759 --> 16:35.695
I have to sign a release so
you can broadcast this, right?

16:37.731 --> 16:41.601
Initial there,
and... Never!

16:41.668 --> 16:44.036
Can you tell me when
this is gonna be on?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.371
I'm thinking
of having a party.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.013
Lisa, why did you
bring me here?

16:54.081 --> 16:55.548
Oh, I don't know.

16:55.616 --> 16:57.283
I thought one
of these super-successful people

16:57.351 --> 16:59.886
might tell you how important
it is to stay in school.

16:59.953 --> 17:03.990
Why, look. It's Mark Zuckerberg,
the founder of Facebook!

17:05.459 --> 17:06.826
Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm Lisa,

17:06.894 --> 17:08.194
and this is Nelson.

17:08.262 --> 17:09.695
S'up, Zuck?

17:09.763 --> 17:11.163
"Mark Zuckerberg is...

17:11.231 --> 17:13.733
happy to meet new friends."

17:13.800 --> 17:15.835
That's great,
Mr. Zuckerberg,

17:15.903 --> 17:17.603
but I was hoping
you could tell us

17:17.671 --> 17:21.073
how education was
instrumental to your success.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.910
Well, the truth is...
I dropped out of Harvard.

17:23.977 --> 17:26.312
You did?
Better earnin'
than learnin'!

17:26.380 --> 17:28.648
Hell, yeah! I'll get
the best kind of degree--

17:28.715 --> 17:30.349
honorary, baby!

17:30.417 --> 17:32.952
Well, clearly,
you're an exception.

17:33.020 --> 17:35.955
Am I, Lisa?
Bill Gates-- dropout.

17:36.023 --> 17:38.457
Virgin Airlines'
Richard Branson-- dropout.

17:38.525 --> 17:42.261
Well... didn't anybody here stay
in school?

17:42.329 --> 17:44.997
Man:
I did. Graduated
magna cum lade.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.566
There, you see?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.035
I'm afraid

17:49.102 --> 17:50.937
I haven't done
too well for myself.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.773
But I can certainly appreciate
the irony of it.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.643
(playful grunting
and laughter)

18:04.584 --> 18:08.154
So, how did everyone do
with their $50?

18:08.172 --> 18:10.039
Well, I learned
a valuable lesson

18:10.107 --> 18:12.008
about wanting more
than I could afford.

18:12.076 --> 18:13.476
Marge, you couldn't have fun

18:13.544 --> 18:15.878
if you were a monkey
on a banana boat!

18:15.946 --> 18:18.648
I used Grampa's money
to try to help someone in need,

18:18.715 --> 18:20.650
but it didn't go the way
I expected.

18:20.717 --> 18:23.820
Aw, sweetie, money
can't change people.

18:23.887 --> 18:26.155
It can just help them
be who they are.

18:26.223 --> 18:27.790
I gave a bum a dollar once,

18:27.858 --> 18:31.127
and he used it to buy
an Ellery Queen mystery.

18:31.195 --> 18:34.197
But there was one mystery
Ellery Queen couldn't solve--

18:34.264 --> 18:36.866
why a man was named Ellery.

18:36.934 --> 18:38.734
But my point is,

18:38.802 --> 18:42.905
whatever I said before I started
talking about Ellery Queen.

18:46.510 --> 18:49.445
Nelson, I just wanted to say
that I realize now

18:49.513 --> 18:54.183
you can't be anyone else other
than who you are, and... Huh?

18:54.251 --> 18:57.920
Look, everyone,
just chill out!

18:57.988 --> 18:59.856
My <i>Wizard of Oz</i> bike
fell apart

18:59.923 --> 19:01.557
in the middle
of the Pride parade!

19:01.625 --> 19:03.126
What kind of pride?

19:03.193 --> 19:05.661
Never you mind what kind!
Fix my bike!

19:05.729 --> 19:07.797
I want my money back!

19:07.865 --> 19:11.134
Fine. Here's exactly
what you paid me.

19:11.201 --> 19:12.668
Thank you!

19:12.736 --> 19:15.771
Oh! Why is this happening?

19:15.839 --> 19:19.375
Uh, this epoxy you've been using
is water soluble,

19:19.443 --> 19:21.711
which means it's not
weather-resistant.

19:21.778 --> 19:23.513
Dumb it down for me.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.617
Um... bike... sticky...
water go bye-bye?

19:27.684 --> 19:30.119
Some sticky water stay-stay?

19:30.187 --> 19:31.254
All bye-bye.

19:31.321 --> 19:33.689
Oh!
Hi, Nelson.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.325
Lisa, I've been
thinking and...
(metal clanking)

19:36.393 --> 19:39.762
It fell apart when I was trying
to impress this cute girl.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.497
My gramma!

19:41.565 --> 19:43.833
Maybe I could use a
little more school.

19:43.901 --> 19:45.301
You can't
break us up.

19:45.369 --> 19:46.736
We're like a
family here.

19:46.803 --> 19:48.704
Kearney and I are
having brunch on Sunday.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.239
If I'm up.

19:50.307 --> 19:52.675
Listen, what say
we go back to the school?

19:52.743 --> 19:56.579
I'll help you out with a little
micro-financing of my own.

19:56.647 --> 19:59.549
$50! I can buy paint
for the art class,

19:59.616 --> 20:02.051
instead of those crushed-up
berries I find in the woods.

20:02.119 --> 20:05.188
And Lisa, I've got a little left
that I'd like to spend on you.

20:05.255 --> 20:06.589
(organ playing waltz)

20:06.657 --> 20:08.124
(giggling)

20:08.192 --> 20:10.560
This is really fun.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.461
But we're still just
friends, right?

20:12.529 --> 20:14.030
Right. Friends.

20:14.097 --> 20:16.399
Can I hold your hand...
for balance?

20:16.466 --> 20:18.467
Sure... for balance.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.071
(smooching)

20:22.139 --> 20:24.006
(squeals)
Haw-haw!

20:24.074 --> 20:25.408
Sorry.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.043
Haw-haw!

20:27.110 --> 20:28.211
(laughs)
Sorry.

20:31.281 --> 20:33.349
Oh! (grunts)

20:33.417 --> 20:34.684
Whoa! Oh!

20:36.053 --> 20:39.522
"Mark Zuckerberg is..."

20:49.666 --> 20:51.534
(thudding)
Nelson: <i>Haw-haw!</i>
Lisa: <i>Sorry.</i>
