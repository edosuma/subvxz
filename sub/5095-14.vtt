00:07.599 --> 00:09.298
DANNY:
This is the Conway Residences.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.600
Where's the crime scene?

00:10.602 --> 00:12.201
BAEZ: Central said to use
the auxiliary entrance.

00:12.203 --> 00:13.870
You want the
door next door.

00:13.872 --> 00:15.605
What's wrong with this door?

00:15.607 --> 00:17.707
This must be
an 80-20.

00:17.709 --> 00:18.975
We're going to
the poor door.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.109
The what?

00:20.111 --> 00:22.412
Real estate developer
wants to grease the wheels

00:22.414 --> 00:24.080
to get a luxury
high-rise built,

00:24.082 --> 00:26.282
(rings) he's gotta make 20% of
the units affordable housing.

00:26.284 --> 00:27.784
Oh.

00:27.786 --> 00:29.586
So this is the door
the affordable people use.

00:29.587 --> 00:30.720
Yep. The poor door.

00:30.722 --> 00:31.988
(door buzzing)
Got it.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.623
After you.

00:33.625 --> 00:35.692
You the first on the scene?
Yeah.

00:35.694 --> 00:36.993
You speak to the neighbors?

00:36.995 --> 00:38.561
Anybody hear anything?
Not that they're saying.

00:38.563 --> 00:40.296
Apparently, the victim
didn't show up to work,

00:40.298 --> 00:41.330
wasn't answering
his phone,

00:41.332 --> 00:43.066
so his mom came by
and found him.

00:43.068 --> 00:44.534
She had a key.

00:44.536 --> 00:46.002
That's her,
down there.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.837
Thank you.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.808
You better talk to her.

00:54.312 --> 00:56.345
Ma'am, I'm
Detective Baez.

00:56.347 --> 00:57.714
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

Deputy Commissioner Moore

01:23.875 --> 01:25.708
is on his
way up, sir.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.976
Did he say what he wanted?

01:26.978 --> 01:28.978
Does he ever?
I had a heads up from Teddy Nelson

01:28.980 --> 01:30.847
at the <i> Daily News.</i>

01:30.849 --> 01:32.815
They're going to run this
tomorrow on the cover.

01:32.817 --> 01:35.118
Thank you, Baker.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.886
Nice car.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.721
And that nice car is a Ferrari

01:38.723 --> 01:41.290
with a Fraternal Order
of Detectives plate

01:41.292 --> 01:43.926
and an NYPD placard on the dash.

01:43.928 --> 01:45.328
Whose car is it?

01:45.330 --> 01:47.530
It's registered to
a veteran narcotics detective,

01:47.532 --> 01:48.798
Louis Weems.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.366
This thing's gotta be

01:50.368 --> 01:53.402
three years of a detective's
salary, before taxes.

01:53.404 --> 01:54.704
Almost to the dollar.

01:54.706 --> 01:56.839
And the press is going
to do the same math.

01:56.841 --> 01:58.875
A narcotics cop
who, routinely,

01:58.877 --> 02:00.443
in the course of his duties,

02:00.445 --> 02:02.545
seizes piles of drugs and cash.

02:02.547 --> 02:04.347
Is he known to I.A.?
No.

02:04.349 --> 02:05.349
Record's spotless.

02:05.350 --> 02:06.516
Does his family have money?

02:06.518 --> 02:07.583
Single.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.085
Parents own a dry cleaners
in St. Albans.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.788
Okay.

02:11.790 --> 02:14.390
But we are going to assume

02:14.392 --> 02:16.259
there is
a legitimate explanation

02:16.261 --> 02:18.094
we haven't thought of
right off the bat.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.562
Okay.

02:19.564 --> 02:22.265
But there's another thing.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.600
He's a former partner
and drinking buddy

02:24.602 --> 02:26.269
of Lieutenant Gormley's...

02:27.772 --> 02:29.372
...who wants to quarterback

02:29.374 --> 02:31.407
whatever digging
we do from here.

02:31.409 --> 02:32.542
Because?

02:32.544 --> 02:34.744
Because he says Weems
is one of the good guys

02:34.746 --> 02:36.679
who's gonna get
burned at the stake

02:36.681 --> 02:38.815
just for being savvy.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.919
Savvy, huh?

02:42.921 --> 02:45.588
All right, what
would you rather do,

02:45.590 --> 02:50.159
lick the tiles
on the Lincoln Tunnel

02:50.161 --> 02:54.997
or... go skinny-dipping
in the Gowanus Canal?

02:54.999 --> 02:56.132
You're sick,
you know that?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.534
You have to answer
the question.

02:58.536 --> 03:00.136
Ooh.
I don't have to answer the question.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.671

Hey! Stay down!
Stay down!

Where's the gun?
I don't got one!

04:04.202 --> 04:05.902
What?
I took a bullet. I need some help.

04:05.904 --> 04:07.203
EDDIE:
Oh, you need help?

04:07.205 --> 04:08.704
30 seconds ago,
you were trying to kill us

04:08.706 --> 04:09.772
and now you need help?

04:09.774 --> 04:10.907
I didn't shoot nobody!

04:10.909 --> 04:12.808
I don't have a gun.
Hey, shut up.

04:12.810 --> 04:14.477
You cover him,
I'll cuff him.

04:14.479 --> 04:16.745
Roll over.
(groans)

04:18.016 --> 04:19.281
Shooter got away.

introduced himself

04:55.472 --> 04:57.037

04:57.039 --> 04:58.228
What do you mean,
he won the lottery?

04:58.229 --> 04:59.528
Not like you're thinking.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.296
To get into this side of the

Yeah, management company.

05:17.648 --> 05:18.680
I'll give you the guy.

You ever see any

Any criminal activity?

05:23.354 --> 05:25.154
Oh, no. I mean, not him.
He's a school teacher.

05:25.156 --> 05:27.589
He taught up in the Bronx--
like, fourth grade or something.

05:27.591 --> 05:28.791
Super healthy guy, too.

05:28.793 --> 05:29.958
He'd go for a run
in the morning,

05:29.960 --> 05:31.260
and drink green
juice, like that.

05:31.262 --> 05:32.694
In fact, he got caught
using the gym here.

05:32.696 --> 05:34.463
What-what do you mean,
he got caught?

05:34.465 --> 05:36.698
Well, the gym is off-limits
to the poor door side,

05:36.700 --> 05:38.333
and, uh, he got
into it with a guy,

05:38.335 --> 05:39.268
couple weeks ago.

05:39.270 --> 05:40.436
Wow.
For using the gym?

05:40.438 --> 05:42.738
Yeah.
The roof deck, pool, gym...

05:42.740 --> 05:44.706
they're all for
the retail side only.

05:44.708 --> 05:46.508
The guy got all up
in Diego's face.

05:46.510 --> 05:48.510
This "guy," he have a name?
Yeah.

05:48.512 --> 05:51.013
Mr. Carstairs, 22B.

05:56.053 --> 05:57.486
Got a minute?

05:57.488 --> 05:58.887
Of course, boss.

06:02.993 --> 06:06.061
I just got a call from the mayor
about Detective Weems.

06:06.063 --> 06:07.863
About the car thing?

06:07.865 --> 06:09.832
He feels that when
this hits the paper,

06:09.834 --> 06:11.834
he will be vulnerable on his

06:11.836 --> 06:14.403
Tale of Two Cities
re-election platform.

06:14.405 --> 06:16.738
This isn't a tale
of two cities, boss.

06:16.740 --> 06:19.708
This is more like one of those
Horatio Alger stories.

06:19.710 --> 06:21.376
How's that?

06:21.378 --> 06:22.845
Louis Weems is one of those guys

06:22.847 --> 06:25.914
who would've succeeded no matter
what field he went into.

06:25.916 --> 06:27.149
I mean,

06:27.151 --> 06:29.618
he sees value where
other people miss it.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.753
Guy could be an entrepreneur.

06:31.755 --> 06:34.590
Guy drives a Ferrari
on a detective's salary.

06:34.592 --> 06:37.092
He must be an entrepreneur
in some sense.

06:37.094 --> 06:40.329
Boss, I've known Louis Weems
since I came on the job.

06:40.331 --> 06:43.499
We were partners together
when I worked Narcotics;

06:43.501 --> 06:45.934
he's the godfather
to my son Brendan.

06:45.936 --> 06:49.705
So your vision could be cloudy
where Louis Weems is concerned.

06:49.707 --> 06:51.673
No, I looked under
all the rocks.

06:51.675 --> 06:52.741
The ones he showed you?

06:52.743 --> 06:54.476
Even his personnel file,

06:54.478 --> 06:57.312
including everything
I.A. poked around in.

06:57.314 --> 07:00.349
I-I-I put it all
in a 49 for you.

07:00.351 --> 07:03.118
Uh, last few years he made

07:03.120 --> 07:05.087
300, 400K.

07:05.089 --> 07:06.455
The extra income

07:06.457 --> 07:10.225
coming from real estate
transactions in Brooklyn North.

07:10.227 --> 07:11.660
It's on the up-and-up.

07:11.662 --> 07:12.662
I swear, boss.

07:12.663 --> 07:14.096
They call him Lightning Louie

07:14.098 --> 07:17.099
because he's a real savvy
kind of guy, that's all.

07:19.336 --> 07:21.570
When this hits the papers
tomorrow, Sid,

07:21.572 --> 07:23.772
we're going to be
the punch line of the day.

07:23.774 --> 07:26.208
All due respect, sir,
that's not his fault.

07:26.210 --> 07:29.778
But I hope you're clear
on what your job is in this.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.647
Sir?

07:31.649 --> 07:34.383
You're part of
my command staff now.

07:34.385 --> 07:37.152

for your buddy;

07:37.154 --> 07:40.889
your job is to look out for me.

07:40.891 --> 07:42.224
Yeah, I know that, sir.

07:42.226 --> 07:44.993
You still want
to quarterback this?

07:44.995 --> 07:46.828
Yeah, yeah.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.330
Yes, sir.

07:52.603 --> 07:54.303
I don't gotta tell you nothing, all right?
Listen...

07:54.305 --> 07:56.038
Why don't you make yourself useful
Just calm down, all right?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.639

08:05.616 --> 08:08.016

08:08.018 --> 08:09.618
but five'll get you ten
it was reported stolen.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.053
He's giving
up nothing?

08:11.055 --> 08:13.155
A lot of attitude,
that's it.

08:13.157 --> 08:14.957
Keep your ears open.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.558
If he lets anything slip,
let me know.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.861
MAN: Could I get a little
help in here, please?

08:19.863 --> 08:22.030

reach my water.

to give up the shooter.

than done.

09:29.566 --> 09:30.732
Yeah,

09:30.734 --> 09:32.534
let me guess-- not real hot.

09:32.536 --> 09:35.003
You shoot a cop,
you shoot a brother.

09:35.005 --> 09:36.138
I didn't shoot that cop.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.106
Somebody else did.

09:38.108 --> 09:40.676
But I'm sorry, all right?

09:40.678 --> 09:42.878
Please, come on,
I got cotton mouth.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.292
(sighs)

10:01.965 --> 10:04.066
Thank you.

10:10.607 --> 10:12.774
Is that the new issue?

10:17.348 --> 10:18.914
Well, can I see it
when you're done?

10:21.218 --> 10:23.385
(sighs)

10:26.156 --> 10:27.656
BAEZ:
I think that's the guy.

10:30.627 --> 10:31.827
Martin Carstairs?

10:31.829 --> 10:32.928
Yes?

10:32.930 --> 10:34.629
Detective Reagan,
this is Detective Baez.

10:34.631 --> 10:36.031
We need to ask you
a few questions.

10:36.033 --> 10:37.165
Sure.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.767
Saw this coming.

10:38.769 --> 10:39.701
Here's my card.

10:39.703 --> 10:42.104
You're a lawyer,
Mr. Carstairs?

10:42.106 --> 10:44.373
I assume this is about
the little shoving match

10:44.375 --> 10:45.741
with the dead Puerto Rican kid?

10:45.743 --> 10:48.410
Why don't you tell us
about your little shoving match

10:48.412 --> 10:49.745
with the dead Puerto Rican kid?

10:49.747 --> 10:51.513
What am I supposed to say?

10:51.515 --> 10:52.681
Puerto Rican American?

10:52.683 --> 10:54.750
It's a tone thing.
Okay.

10:54.752 --> 10:56.118
Look, just tell us
what happened, all right?

10:56.120 --> 10:58.186
I'm in the fitness center
and this Puerto...

10:58.188 --> 10:59.921
this gentleman...
he's in there, like, every day.

10:59.923 --> 11:02.190
I know he lives
behind the poor door,

11:02.192 --> 11:03.425
so I call him on it.

11:03.427 --> 11:04.826
Says he's a guest.

11:04.828 --> 11:05.961
A guest?

11:05.963 --> 11:07.662
His girlfriend gave him
a swipe card.

11:07.664 --> 11:08.697
White girl from the penthouse.

11:08.699 --> 11:11.233
A white girl?
Yeah, so?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.634
Well, you wouldn't have
said "white girl"

11:12.636 --> 11:13.869
if it was a white guy.

11:13.871 --> 11:15.504
What?

11:15.506 --> 11:16.838
Hey, (stammers)
just keep going.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.173
What happened next?

11:18.175 --> 11:19.708
Nothing.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.743
A couple of shoves,
I called the management company,

11:21.745 --> 11:23.211
he never showed up again.

11:23.213 --> 11:25.213
Where were you
the night before last?

11:25.215 --> 11:27.115
Seriously?

11:27.117 --> 11:28.950
I was out with a white girl.

11:28.952 --> 11:30.285
All night.
All right.

11:30.287 --> 11:31.920
Great, we're gonna
need to speak

11:31.922 --> 11:33.522
to this, uh, white girl.

11:33.524 --> 11:37.025
You know, talking wasn't
her strong suit.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.996
We'll be in touch.

11:40.998 --> 11:42.664
Adios.

11:42.666 --> 11:45.333
Yeah, adios yourself.

11:49.506 --> 11:50.439
(groans)

11:50.441 --> 11:52.374
What the hell?
You asked for it.

11:52.376 --> 11:54.075
What a jerk.

11:54.077 --> 11:55.510
All right, then
just give it back.

11:55.512 --> 11:57.379
No, come on, come on.

11:57.381 --> 11:58.413
What do you got?

11:58.415 --> 12:00.549
A bullet in the gut,
you know that.

12:00.551 --> 12:01.750
No, I mean, car.

12:01.752 --> 12:03.785
Geez.
Why do you think I got a car?

12:03.787 --> 12:05.854
Anybody over 16 who reads
that's either got one

12:05.856 --> 12:07.756
or is buying or selling.

12:07.758 --> 12:08.790
Even in Mineola.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.058
I'm from Uniondale.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.060
Even worse.

12:12.062 --> 12:13.628
I had a '65 Goat.

12:13.630 --> 12:14.996
What do you got?

12:14.998 --> 12:17.599
Had a '71 Chevelle SS.

12:17.601 --> 12:18.733
396?

12:18.735 --> 12:21.136
454.

12:21.138 --> 12:23.438
Tremac transmission,

12:23.440 --> 12:25.140
hooker headers, roller cam.

12:25.142 --> 12:26.741
Mm, nice.

12:26.743 --> 12:29.377
Yeah.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.249
So, why did you sell the Goat?

12:34.251 --> 12:35.317
I didn't.

12:35.319 --> 12:38.820
Idiot friend of mine
wrapped it around a pole

12:38.822 --> 12:40.555
on the Southern State
doing 110.

12:40.557 --> 12:41.890
Did he die?

12:41.892 --> 12:43.058
Broke an arm.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.160
Guy gets away with everything.

12:45.162 --> 12:47.229
Same guy who left you
high and dry?

12:47.231 --> 12:48.530
Some friend.

12:48.532 --> 12:50.365
Yeah, like I said,
he's an idiot.

12:50.367 --> 12:53.101
That GTO had original
drum brakes on it, huh?

12:53.103 --> 12:54.336
Yeah.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.071
That was the thing--
that beast could move,

12:56.073 --> 12:57.706
but it took forever to stop.

12:57.708 --> 12:59.875
Well, those brakes suck.

13:02.746 --> 13:04.045
JAMIE:
<i>Cantwell had a '65</i>

13:04.047 --> 13:05.847
GTO that got into a big wreck

13:05.849 --> 13:08.149
on the Southern State Parkway
about a year ago April.

13:08.151 --> 13:10.719
Driver in the accident report
is likely our shooter.

13:10.721 --> 13:12.020
Yeah.

13:12.022 --> 13:13.255
Okay, will do.

13:13.257 --> 13:15.857
Thank you.

13:15.859 --> 13:17.592
I can't believe he
gave you the shooter.

13:17.594 --> 13:19.561
Yeah, not on purpose.

13:19.563 --> 13:21.029
Guy's a real
box of rocks.

13:21.031 --> 13:23.398
You don't got to pass a test
to become a criminal.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.933
(phone ringing)

13:24.935 --> 13:26.167
The girl from
the penthouse?

13:26.169 --> 13:27.969
Yeah, Rada Radchenko.

13:27.971 --> 13:29.971
Oh, she's a
real looker.

13:29.973 --> 13:32.641
This is her father,
he owns the penthouse.

13:32.643 --> 13:34.776
Ivan Radchenko.

13:34.778 --> 13:36.444
What do we know
about him?

13:36.446 --> 13:37.846
Uh, money comes

13:37.848 --> 13:40.715
from Russian oil
and gas.

13:42.019 --> 13:44.252
He's former KGB.

13:44.254 --> 13:46.288
Well, those KGB guys made off
with big money,

13:46.290 --> 13:47.656
throwing elbows all the way.

13:47.658 --> 13:50.692
Well, he's certainly trying
to make a legit life here.

13:50.694 --> 13:52.627
On the board of the ballet,

13:52.629 --> 13:54.529
honoree at big time
charity benefits.

13:54.531 --> 13:55.697
Huh.

13:55.699 --> 13:57.098
High society stuff.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.667
Yeah, a real fancy-pants.

13:58.669 --> 13:59.669
(clicks mouse)

13:59.670 --> 14:00.936
And there's
the happy couple.

14:00.938 --> 14:02.737
So Diego and
Rada start dating,

14:02.739 --> 14:04.072
KGB dad doesn't
like it.

14:04.074 --> 14:06.675
You know, kind of
like <i> Romeo and Juliet.</i>

14:06.677 --> 14:08.610
Well, as I remember
from high school English,

14:08.612 --> 14:10.779
that didn't work out
too well for them.

14:18.789 --> 14:20.989
(sobbing)

14:22.893 --> 14:25.093
(sobbing continues)

14:26.096 --> 14:28.530
BAEZ: Is that Radchenko
with the mother?

14:28.532 --> 14:30.665
Yep.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.034
They sure don't seem like the
Capulets and the Montagues.

14:33.036 --> 14:34.302
The who?

14:34.304 --> 14:35.971
The two families
from <i> Romeo and Juliet</i>

14:35.973 --> 14:37.372
(phone ringing)
that hated each other.

14:37.374 --> 14:39.341
Yeah, this ain't
that story.

14:39.343 --> 14:40.875
Reagan.

14:42.012 --> 14:44.212
You're kidding me.
How much?

14:45.082 --> 14:46.381
Unbelievable.

14:46.383 --> 14:48.350
Yeah, thanks.

14:48.352 --> 14:52.387
CSU found a half a key of
coke in Diego's closet.

14:52.389 --> 14:54.723
Well, that definitely didn't
happen to Romeo and Juliet.

14:54.725 --> 14:56.057
Well, like I said,

14:56.059 --> 14:57.592
this is
a different story.

15:14.151 --> 15:15.284
Hey, Reagan.

15:15.286 --> 15:16.618
Detective.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.587
Nassau County PD
came up with a name

15:18.589 --> 15:20.889
on the possible
shooter-- Theo Salzer.

15:20.891 --> 15:22.991
Good work.
They gonna talk to him?

15:22.993 --> 15:25.027
Yeah, we're sitting on his
apartment out in Hempstead,

15:25.029 --> 15:27.095
but I don't think he's
coming home anytime soon.

15:27.097 --> 15:28.330
He's got two other
warrants out on him.

15:28.332 --> 15:29.731
Both for armed robbery.

15:29.733 --> 15:32.401
They gonna offer Cantwell
a deal to cooperate?

15:32.403 --> 15:34.069
No.

15:34.071 --> 15:35.671
Cop got shot.

15:35.673 --> 15:38.006
No discounts
for nobody.

15:38.008 --> 15:40.108
See if you can squeeze another
nugget out of your boy.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.543
He's not my boy.

15:44.114 --> 15:45.247
(men laughing)

15:45.249 --> 15:46.615
Ten-hut!

15:47.785 --> 15:49.117
As you were.

15:49.119 --> 15:51.320
Boss, this is
Detective Weems.

15:51.322 --> 15:53.855
Commissioner, this
is my privilege.

15:53.857 --> 15:55.190
This is my
union delegate,

15:55.192 --> 15:56.525
Detective
Tim Cafferty.

15:56.527 --> 15:59.962
I assure you this is meant
to be an informal discussion.

15:59.964 --> 16:01.196
Please.
Understood.

16:01.198 --> 16:04.566
I-I wanted to come
stag, but, you know,

16:04.568 --> 16:05.934
the union insisted, so...

16:05.936 --> 16:07.269
Anyway, here we are.

16:07.271 --> 16:08.770
And here this is.

16:12.076 --> 16:13.575
Yeah, I saw that.

16:13.577 --> 16:15.777
And it makes
you feel...?

16:15.779 --> 16:18.680
Like it must be a slow news day.

16:18.682 --> 16:20.649
CAFFERTY:
There's no infraction here,

16:20.651 --> 16:22.150
legal or departmental.

16:22.152 --> 16:26.054
I understand you've been
speculating in real estate.

16:26.056 --> 16:27.756
Yeah, well, I've been working
Brooklyn North Narcotics now

16:27.758 --> 16:29.324
for, like, 12 years,

16:29.326 --> 16:32.661
and thanks to a lot of hard
work from all our guys,

16:32.663 --> 16:34.263
you know, we're bringing
back a hellhole.

16:34.264 --> 16:35.564
Block by block.

16:35.566 --> 16:38.200
So, yeah, you know, I bought
a house, I made some money.

16:38.202 --> 16:40.335
After I flipped it,
I bought another house,

16:40.337 --> 16:41.303
kind of like that.

16:41.305 --> 16:42.304
And as a narcotics detective,

16:42.306 --> 16:43.438
you're in a unique
position

16:43.440 --> 16:44.773
to see a change
in the neighborhood.

16:44.775 --> 16:46.408
Oh, yeah,
well, I mean,

16:46.410 --> 16:47.843
you clean out
a crackhouse,

16:47.845 --> 16:49.044
that block just
got better.

16:49.046 --> 16:50.212
You can see the value.

16:50.214 --> 16:53.448
You ever buy a crackhouse,
then clean it out?

16:55.252 --> 16:57.953
No, no, that would be
against the law.

16:57.955 --> 17:00.122
You clean it out, then buy it,

17:00.124 --> 17:02.157
that's legal.

17:02.159 --> 17:04.393
Uh, what's the timing on that?

17:04.395 --> 17:06.328
For instance,
raid a building on Tuesday,

17:06.329 --> 17:08.329
put in an offer on Wednesday?

17:08.332 --> 17:10.632
Well, all business is timing.

17:11.502 --> 17:13.468
So is all insider trading.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.708
Internal Affairs already looked
into this-- it's all legit.

17:19.710 --> 17:22.010
I know, I know.

17:22.012 --> 17:23.578
And I understand.

17:28.752 --> 17:31.119
Louis,

17:31.121 --> 17:33.121
say you're a rookie,

17:33.123 --> 17:34.456
and you find out

17:34.458 --> 17:37.459
that a detective in your
precinct is driving around

17:37.461 --> 17:40.195
in an expensive car
and buying up real estate.

17:40.197 --> 17:42.264
What would you think?

17:42.266 --> 17:43.999
And he's legit?

17:44.001 --> 17:46.201
Not really my point.

17:46.203 --> 17:49.004
I'd make it my business
to buy that detective a drink

17:49.006 --> 17:50.939
and get to know
everything about him.

17:54.311 --> 17:56.178
(chuckles)

17:57.314 --> 17:59.181
Thanks for coming up.

18:08.792 --> 18:12.494
Get in touch with Carla Brooks
at the Department of Buildings,

18:12.496 --> 18:15.597
use my name and get me
everything they have

18:15.599 --> 18:16.731
on the detective's activities,

18:16.733 --> 18:18.834
then send it over to ADA Reagan.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.802
May I ask why?

18:20.804 --> 18:22.737
Do you need to ask why?

18:22.739 --> 18:23.905
Sir, it's been gone over.

18:23.907 --> 18:26.408
I mean, why are you going
after a guy for being savvy?

18:28.312 --> 18:30.846
There's that word again.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.681
Why are you pushing
back, Lieutenant?

18:32.683 --> 18:35.617
I'm not, I'm just...
Standing up for a stand-up guy.

18:35.619 --> 18:37.919
You put it that way,
well, yeah.

18:37.921 --> 18:39.221
Then don't.

18:39.223 --> 18:41.223
That is not your
job in this,

18:41.225 --> 18:43.158
and if you can't do
your job in this

18:43.160 --> 18:44.893
because of your
friendship with Weems,

18:44.895 --> 18:46.294
say so right now.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.196
Well, what is my job in this?

18:48.198 --> 18:51.900
Something is not proper simply
because it is permissible,

18:51.902 --> 18:54.236
nor is it ethical
because it is legal.

18:54.238 --> 18:56.905
Cops have to be held
to a higher standard.

18:56.907 --> 19:00.976
And if there's a way to
stop this, to thwart him,

19:00.978 --> 19:02.944
I want to know about it.

19:02.946 --> 19:04.279
Any more questions?

19:04.281 --> 19:05.313
No, sir.

19:05.315 --> 19:06.648
Carla Brooks, use my name.

19:06.650 --> 19:08.316
Loop in ADA Reagan.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.418
Yes, sir.
That's all.

19:12.523 --> 19:14.689
(sighs)

19:18.595 --> 19:21.062
They'll be right with you.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.599
Wow, fancy.

19:24.601 --> 19:25.967
Yeah.

19:25.969 --> 19:28.303
M-O-N-E-Y fancy.

19:28.305 --> 19:30.472
Uh...

19:30.474 --> 19:32.908
Ivan Radchenko.

19:32.910 --> 19:33.842
Detective Reagan.

19:33.844 --> 19:35.544
Detective Baez.
Welcome.

19:35.546 --> 19:37.846
She's very fragile right now.

19:37.848 --> 19:39.814
We understand.

19:39.816 --> 19:41.516
You were in law
enforcement yourself,

19:41.518 --> 19:43.451
is that right, Mr. Radchenko?

19:43.453 --> 19:45.420
Yes, I was.

19:45.422 --> 19:48.156
Now you'll ask me
if I have any theory

19:48.158 --> 19:50.192
about who did
this terrible thing?

19:50.194 --> 19:51.459
Do you?

19:51.461 --> 19:53.061
Look,

19:53.063 --> 19:55.797
as a father
to a beautiful young woman,

19:55.799 --> 19:57.465
I was skeptical
about this man.

19:57.467 --> 19:59.434
Yes, naturally.

19:59.436 --> 20:01.102
Over the time
I came to know him,

20:01.104 --> 20:02.771
he was a good man.

20:02.773 --> 20:04.439
He was... he was a striver.

20:04.441 --> 20:07.442
He was a hard worker, uh...

20:07.444 --> 20:10.045
Uh, I don't know
why anyone would do this.

20:10.047 --> 20:11.246
(door closes)

20:13.417 --> 20:14.816
Rada?

20:16.954 --> 20:18.987
Uh, Detective
Reagan...

20:18.989 --> 20:20.722
Uh, I apologize.

20:20.724 --> 20:22.023
Baez.
Right.

20:22.025 --> 20:23.158
Hello.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.326
Hi, Rada.

20:24.328 --> 20:25.927
You've had a couple
of days to think

20:25.929 --> 20:28.096
about what you knew
of Diego. Did you?

20:28.098 --> 20:30.098
Yes, of course.
Is there anything

20:30.100 --> 20:31.233
you can point
us towards,

20:31.235 --> 20:32.801
someone he might have
had a conflict with?

20:32.803 --> 20:34.970
Even the smallest thing
could be helpful.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.571
No.

20:36.573 --> 20:39.174
He just wanted
to bring light to the world,

20:39.176 --> 20:41.176
to the kids he taught,

20:41.178 --> 20:42.544
to everything.

20:42.546 --> 20:44.679
Uh-huh. And how 'bout the drugs?

20:44.681 --> 20:45.947
Cocaine.

20:45.949 --> 20:47.849
Was that how he wanted to bring
light to the world?

20:47.851 --> 20:50.485
What are you talking about?

20:50.487 --> 20:52.821
Cocaine that we found
in his closet.

20:52.823 --> 20:54.389
Cocaine?
Oh, yeah. A whole lot of it.

20:55.626 --> 20:57.859
That's not true.

20:57.861 --> 20:59.394
We have no reason to lie to you.

20:59.396 --> 21:00.962
Rada...

21:00.964 --> 21:03.031
is there something
you're hiding from me?

21:03.033 --> 21:04.966
No, I know him...

21:04.968 --> 21:06.368
Rada.
(speaking Russian)

21:06.370 --> 21:08.270
RADA:
No.

21:08.272 --> 21:10.338
I know everything
about him.

21:10.340 --> 21:12.907
(speaks Russian)
Was Diego having

21:12.909 --> 21:15.076
any trouble with money,
student loans?

21:15.078 --> 21:17.012
Did he talk about anything
like that?

21:17.014 --> 21:18.446
No.

21:18.448 --> 21:21.549
He would never go
near drugs. He...

21:21.551 --> 21:23.151
He was a schoolteacher.

21:23.153 --> 21:25.420
Right. So maybe you just went
down to his apartment

21:25.422 --> 21:26.921
and did some cocaine

21:26.923 --> 21:28.423
with your drug dealing
boyfriend?

21:28.425 --> 21:30.792
Please.
I can't listen to this.

21:30.794 --> 21:32.294
Rada.

21:32.296 --> 21:34.696
Rada, Rada.

21:34.698 --> 21:37.599
(door opens, closes)
Rada.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.572
Hey, can you do me

21:44.574 --> 21:46.441
a solid and take these cuffs off
so I can cut this meat here?

21:46.443 --> 21:48.576
Please?

21:51.281 --> 21:53.315
Where's Theo Salzer?

21:53.317 --> 21:55.850
More like,<i> who's</i> Theo Salzer?

21:55.852 --> 21:57.852
The guy who wrecked your GTO
with a 1.2

21:57.854 --> 22:00.322
blood alcohol level and
40 pounds of stolen shell steaks

22:00.324 --> 22:02.390
in the trunk.
Oh.

22:02.392 --> 22:03.758
That Theo Salzer.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.560
Yeah. I get it.

22:05.562 --> 22:06.995
Where is he?
I don't know.

22:06.997 --> 22:08.063
Where is he?

22:08.065 --> 22:09.264
I don't want to talk about that.

22:09.266 --> 22:10.799
You don't want
to talk about it?

22:10.801 --> 22:12.467
What... what do you
want to talk about?

22:12.469 --> 22:13.768
You want to talk about

22:13.770 --> 22:15.370
how the cop downstairs
took a bullet from him?

22:15.372 --> 22:16.404
I just want to eat, okay?

22:16.406 --> 22:17.539
You want to talk about

22:17.541 --> 22:18.940
how it shattered his elbow?

22:18.942 --> 22:21.509
So he'll never regain
full use of his arm?

22:21.511 --> 22:22.810
Yeah, so he can never
come back on the job? Huh?

22:22.834 --> 22:24.113
Not my problem, bro.

22:24.114 --> 22:26.047
I'm not your bro.

22:26.049 --> 22:27.482
Yeah, whatever, man.

22:27.484 --> 22:28.516
Whatever, man.
Yeah.

22:28.518 --> 22:29.784
Yeah, you just want to eat,
right?

22:29.786 --> 22:31.219
Yeah, now you're
catching on. Yeah.

22:31.221 --> 22:32.787
Yeah. I'll help you eat, huh?
Why don't I help you eat!

22:32.789 --> 22:34.322
Help! Ow!
Want me to help you eat?!

22:34.324 --> 22:35.390
Reagan!
Help! Help! Where's Theo Salzer?

22:35.392 --> 22:36.958
Where's Theo Salzer?
Ow!

22:36.960 --> 22:38.593
Reagan! Where's Salzer?
Police brutality!

22:38.595 --> 22:41.663
Where's Salzer?
Reagan, come... Reagan, enough. Go.

22:42.532 --> 22:44.399
Get out of here.

23:07.174 --> 23:08.440
(knocking)

23:08.442 --> 23:09.741
Ms. Parsons?

23:09.743 --> 23:11.477
Yes?

23:11.479 --> 23:12.978
Lieutenant Gormley, NYPD.

23:12.980 --> 23:14.713
Look, I told y'all
everything I know.

23:14.715 --> 23:16.348
It was my cousin's boyfriend.

23:16.350 --> 23:18.083
He was not supposed
to be in there.

23:18.085 --> 23:19.918
I did not give him a key

23:19.920 --> 23:21.887
and I didn't have
anything to do with them drugs.

23:21.889 --> 23:24.390
Ms. Parsons, I'm not here
to investigate the drugs.

23:24.392 --> 23:26.091
I'm here to find out
if you were

23:26.093 --> 23:28.327
wrongly evicted
from your home.

23:30.231 --> 23:32.164
Hell, yes, I was.

23:32.166 --> 23:34.066
Can you tell me what happened?

23:34.068 --> 23:37.469
I had to go to North Carolina
for a funeral.

23:37.471 --> 23:39.872
My cousin Shania came
to stay with the girls.

23:39.874 --> 23:42.674
Shania, she hooked up
with this guy,

23:42.676 --> 23:44.309
Roscoe, from downstairs.

23:44.311 --> 23:46.245
And she's always get...

23:46.247 --> 23:49.782
Anyway, the police raid
Roscoe's apartment

23:49.784 --> 23:51.950
and he takes the fire escape
up to my place

23:51.952 --> 23:53.585
with a bag full of drugs.

23:53.587 --> 23:56.422
Police come up,
arrest Shania and Roscoe

23:56.424 --> 23:58.424
and put my kids
in Child Services.

23:58.426 --> 23:59.691
And you came back...

23:59.693 --> 24:01.393
Somebody changed the locks

24:01.395 --> 24:03.295
and me and the girls
wind up in this shelter.

24:03.297 --> 24:05.364
And now they tell me
the building got sold.

24:07.768 --> 24:09.968
Look, Ms. Parsons...

24:11.572 --> 24:14.673
I'm sorry about all this.

24:16.076 --> 24:17.943
I have a lawyer
who can help you.

24:17.945 --> 24:21.413
Assistant District
Attorney Erin Reagan.

24:21.415 --> 24:23.248
Here's her card.
All right?

24:23.250 --> 24:25.417
She's expecting
a call from you, okay?

24:26.353 --> 24:27.820
Okay.

24:33.961 --> 24:35.561
Thank you.

24:37.898 --> 24:40.065
You're welcome.

24:48.509 --> 24:50.142
<i>Te con leche.</i>

24:50.144 --> 24:51.577
We can speak English,

24:51.579 --> 24:52.611
Detective.

24:52.613 --> 24:54.580
Okay, Ms. Torres.

24:54.582 --> 24:56.815
Listen, I know you don't believe

24:56.817 --> 24:59.017
Diego had anything
to do with drugs,

24:59.019 --> 25:02.020
but the fact remains we did
find drugs in the apartment,

25:02.022 --> 25:03.689
so I'm gonna have
to question you about that.

25:03.691 --> 25:05.924
Okay?
I understand.

25:07.661 --> 25:11.163
Was Diego in any kind of money
trouble that you knew about?

25:11.165 --> 25:14.500
No. And he would have
told me if he was.

25:14.502 --> 25:16.368
Do you think
he felt inadequate

25:16.370 --> 25:18.904
dating such a rich girl?
Like maybe he needed

25:18.906 --> 25:21.406
to prove himself
by making big money?

25:21.408 --> 25:22.908
I don't think so.

25:22.910 --> 25:24.977
(sighs)

25:24.979 --> 25:26.311
Do you have any idea

25:26.313 --> 25:28.447
why there would be
cocaine in the apartment?

25:28.449 --> 25:29.882
I don't.

25:29.884 --> 25:32.050
But I know he wasn't
selling drugs.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.785
How?

25:33.787 --> 25:35.153
What do drug dealers want?

25:35.155 --> 25:36.555
They want money, right?

25:36.557 --> 25:38.090
Yeah.

25:38.092 --> 25:41.093
Ivan offered my son
$200,000 to go away,

25:41.095 --> 25:42.494
to leave his daughter alone.

25:42.496 --> 25:44.229
He did?

25:44.231 --> 25:45.697
Diego told you that?

25:45.699 --> 25:46.832
Yes.

25:46.834 --> 25:50.235
You think Ivan wanted
Diego out of the way?

25:50.237 --> 25:51.637
Yes.

25:51.639 --> 25:54.606
They say money
changes everything.

25:54.608 --> 25:57.342
But it couldn't change my son.

25:57.344 --> 25:59.645
He was a good man.

26:04.518 --> 26:06.618
Can I offer you anything?

26:06.620 --> 26:08.320
Yeah, how about Diego's killer?

26:08.322 --> 26:11.423
That I don't have.
As you... you know.

26:11.425 --> 26:13.492
Manuela said you
offered Diego

26:13.494 --> 26:16.261
money to stay away
from Rada, is that right?

26:16.263 --> 26:17.963
Absolutely true.

26:17.965 --> 26:20.766
You must have really wanted him
out of the picture.

26:20.768 --> 26:22.701
If he'd taken the money,
I would have.

26:22.703 --> 26:25.571
Okay, tell us
what you mean.

26:25.573 --> 26:27.739
Of course I tested Diego.

26:27.741 --> 26:29.241
Of course.

26:29.243 --> 26:32.144
For a schoolteacher this
is a lot of money, for me...

26:32.146 --> 26:34.846
it's an efficient way to protect
my daughter from the dogs.

26:34.848 --> 26:36.415
That's all.

26:36.417 --> 26:38.050
We have to ask,
Mr. Radchenko,

26:38.052 --> 26:40.218
where were you
Wednesday night?

26:40.220 --> 26:42.187
I was in Brooklyn
to see the Nets play.

26:42.189 --> 26:43.422
If you need the proof,

26:43.424 --> 26:44.923
I was with
Steve Warren,

26:44.925 --> 26:47.459
Brooklyn borough president.
You can call him.

26:47.461 --> 26:49.795
You can look at
the television coverage.

26:49.797 --> 26:52.331
We were right behind
the visitor bench.

26:55.636 --> 26:58.804
BAEZ: Here's Radchenko
leaving the lobby at 6:05.

26:58.806 --> 27:01.873
Go back over that.

27:01.875 --> 27:05.043
BAEZ:
Okay.

27:05.045 --> 27:06.645
Did you see that?

27:06.647 --> 27:08.080
He nodded at
the other guy.

27:08.082 --> 27:10.382
Let me find a better
angle on him.

27:10.384 --> 27:13.452
Let's try that one.

27:18.859 --> 27:20.225
Was that a nod?

27:20.227 --> 27:22.794
That was definitely a nod.

27:22.796 --> 27:24.496
What are you thinking?

27:24.498 --> 27:26.064
(sighs)

27:29.837 --> 27:31.403
JANKO:
You want some?

27:31.405 --> 27:34.940
Mm-mm.

27:34.942 --> 27:36.375
JANKO:
It's really refreshing.

27:36.377 --> 27:37.876
It's got, like,
negative calories

27:37.878 --> 27:40.345
and great mouth feel.

27:40.347 --> 27:42.080
Mouth feel?

27:42.082 --> 27:43.315
It's a real thing.

27:43.317 --> 27:45.150
They talk about it
on cooking shows.

27:48.956 --> 27:50.489
Hey, what's going on?

27:50.491 --> 27:53.091
The wound's infected.
He's developed sepsis.

27:53.093 --> 27:55.193
What does that mean?

27:55.195 --> 27:56.962
Means we hope
the antibiotics work.

27:56.964 --> 27:58.630
But if I were him,
I wouldn't be

27:58.632 --> 28:00.499
taking out any
magazine subscriptions.

28:05.272 --> 28:06.605
The D.A.'s office determined

28:06.607 --> 28:08.774
Ms. Parsons has
rights to tenancy.

28:08.776 --> 28:10.308
And where's that leave Weems?

28:10.310 --> 28:11.576
Well, he can't
flip it with her

28:11.578 --> 28:13.111
still in residence,
so he's settling.

28:13.113 --> 28:15.514
Happily?
I wouldn't characterize it as that.

28:15.516 --> 28:16.682
Begrudgingly, then?

28:16.684 --> 28:18.216
300 grand, so yeah.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.886
And what are you gonna
do to him next?

28:20.888 --> 28:23.822
To who?
Weems.

28:23.824 --> 28:25.791
I wasn't gonna do anything.

28:25.793 --> 28:28.260
(sighs)

28:28.262 --> 28:31.363
You're not getting this,
are you?

28:31.365 --> 28:33.365
Boss?

28:33.367 --> 28:36.168
This kind of thing,

28:36.170 --> 28:38.603
you see it through,
they talk about it.

28:39.940 --> 28:42.374
How Sid Gormley got wind
that an old pal

28:42.376 --> 28:45.077
was using his shield
to game the system.

28:46.980 --> 28:49.247
And how Sid Gormley

28:49.249 --> 28:52.084
made an example out of him.

28:52.386 --> 28:54.953
I don't want to do this--
he's a friend.

28:54.955 --> 28:57.022
Yeah, you want to do this.
Why?

28:57.024 --> 29:00.125
It's how you make your bones
in this building.

29:00.127 --> 29:01.593
You set standards.

29:01.595 --> 29:04.062
And not just
for your ride-along

29:04.064 --> 29:05.430
or your rookie tail.

29:05.432 --> 29:07.866
You set standards

29:07.868 --> 29:11.669
for all 35,000 of 'em.

29:11.671 --> 29:14.406
Any suggestions?

29:14.408 --> 29:16.007
If I were you--

29:16.009 --> 29:19.544
and right now, I am--

29:19.546 --> 29:23.181
I'd figure I could come up
with something on my own.

29:26.053 --> 29:28.253
All right,
here we go.

29:29.790 --> 29:31.389
(beeping)

29:31.391 --> 29:33.625
BAEZ:
Oleg Kaus. Known ties

29:33.627 --> 29:36.528
to the Russian mob, criminal
possession of a weapon,

29:36.530 --> 29:38.129
assault, assault
with a deadly weapon.

29:38.131 --> 29:39.531
This guy runs
his daughter's life

29:39.533 --> 29:41.599
like it's
a KGB operation.

29:41.601 --> 29:43.535
So she falls in love with
a kid from the wrong side

29:43.537 --> 29:46.371
of the building, he tries
to buy him off, it doesn't work,

29:46.373 --> 29:48.573
so he makes like
it was just a test...

29:48.575 --> 29:50.875
The actions of a concerned
parent. Thank you.

29:50.877 --> 29:53.144
But now he really has to do something.
Uh-huh.

29:53.146 --> 29:56.981
So he hires an assassin,
creates an alibi...

29:56.983 --> 29:59.084
Right. Plants the drugs
in Diego's closet,

29:59.086 --> 30:00.385
throwing off the
investigation

30:00.387 --> 30:02.954
and discrediting Diego
at the same time.

30:02.956 --> 30:04.589
Too sad to be true?

30:04.591 --> 30:06.091
A human tragedy.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.400
Hey.

30:15.402 --> 30:17.469
My blood pressure's
in the toilet.

30:17.471 --> 30:19.637
They said I could die here.

30:19.639 --> 30:21.206
We all got to die somewhere.

30:21.208 --> 30:22.740
Thanks.

30:22.742 --> 30:24.976
What do you expect from me--
a get well card?

30:24.978 --> 30:27.479
Let me make a phone call.

30:27.481 --> 30:28.813
No, you had your call.

30:28.815 --> 30:31.316
No, come on,
I got to call my mother.

30:35.155 --> 30:37.088
All right, I'll tell you what...

30:37.090 --> 30:39.624
I'm not gonna give you Salzer.
Just let me call my mother.

30:46.533 --> 30:48.433
You dial, but I talk first,

30:48.435 --> 30:51.436
all right?
Verify that it's her.

30:54.341 --> 30:56.674
(keys beeping)

30:59.679 --> 31:00.845
(dissonant tone)

31:00.847 --> 31:02.313
Says it's out of service.

31:02.315 --> 31:04.516
You sure the
number's right?

31:05.919 --> 31:07.986
Yeah.

31:07.988 --> 31:10.655
I don't know. I haven't talked
to her in a couple years.

31:10.657 --> 31:12.857
Maybe she moved again.

31:22.402 --> 31:23.635
You got any other family,

31:23.637 --> 31:25.336
anybody else that might
know where she is?

31:25.338 --> 31:27.539
Nope.

31:27.541 --> 31:29.774
Nobody.

31:31.845 --> 31:33.278
You know,
just in case,

31:33.280 --> 31:36.981
uh... could you write
something down for me, please?

31:36.983 --> 31:39.784
To my mom?

31:39.786 --> 31:42.554
In case she comes
for the remains.

31:55.735 --> 31:57.802
Okay, shoot.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.039
<i>No,</i>

32:01.041 --> 32:02.507
I'm not saying that I feel sorry

32:02.509 --> 32:04.309
for him-- he's got a record
goes back to his teens.

32:04.311 --> 32:06.110
His partner
shot a cop.

32:06.112 --> 32:07.345
I know that.

32:07.347 --> 32:08.780
So end of story.

32:08.782 --> 32:10.448
Is this going somewhere?

32:10.450 --> 32:11.450
Let me finish?

32:11.451 --> 32:12.650
Come on, guys.
Okay, so you

32:12.652 --> 32:14.052
don't feel bad, but...

32:14.054 --> 32:14.608
Mom...

32:14.632 --> 32:16.021
Erin, haven't you
ever prosecuted someone

32:16.022 --> 32:17.322
you thought to yourself
how much more

32:17.324 --> 32:18.756
punishment can
one person take?

32:18.758 --> 32:21.059
What do you mean?

32:21.061 --> 32:24.395
Everyone has a choice.
Free will.

32:24.397 --> 32:26.264
Yeah, but some people,
you look at 'em,

32:26.266 --> 32:28.166
you think, there but for
the grace of God go I.

32:28.168 --> 32:30.835
But this guy,
it's like God's got it

32:30.837 --> 32:32.070
out for him
and everyone else

32:32.072 --> 32:33.705
should just
stay back 500 feet.

32:33.707 --> 32:36.407
Well, is there anything you can do?
I don't know--

32:36.409 --> 32:38.810
I was the arresting officer in
an incident where a fellow cop

32:38.812 --> 32:41.212
got wounded. I don't think it's
my job to make his life easier.

32:41.214 --> 32:42.747
Well, if you
could, say,

32:42.749 --> 32:45.817
show some act of kindness,
God would follow it up

32:45.819 --> 32:48.686
by dropping a piano
on his head anyway-- like that?

32:48.688 --> 32:51.522
Ex-Exactly, yes, thank you.
Well, we've all had those.

32:51.524 --> 32:53.758
When I was working patrol,
we had

32:53.760 --> 32:56.094
a B and E out in,
uh, Rego Park.

32:56.096 --> 33:00.064
Homeowner hears a noise
downstairs, calls it in.

33:00.066 --> 33:02.267
I come in through
the kitchen and

33:02.269 --> 33:03.868
I find the guy
in the living room

33:03.870 --> 33:05.503
unhooking the TV.

33:05.505 --> 33:08.139
But he's blind drunk
and he can barely stand up.

33:08.141 --> 33:09.641
So?
So...

33:09.643 --> 33:11.876
the 911 call came in
from the mom.

33:11.878 --> 33:13.778
He'd broken into
his own parents' house.

33:13.780 --> 33:15.280
Seriously?!
Yeah.

33:15.282 --> 33:16.781
(all laughing)

33:16.783 --> 33:17.882
What an idiot.

33:17.884 --> 33:20.251
So, what happened to him?

33:20.253 --> 33:21.886
Mom and Dad pressed charges.

33:21.888 --> 33:23.721
I think he did 18 months for it.

33:23.723 --> 33:25.890
Pass the potatoes, please.

33:46.463 --> 33:47.629
Got a minute?

33:47.631 --> 33:49.330
Shoot.

33:50.867 --> 33:53.368
Sergeant Gormley.

33:53.370 --> 33:54.469
You mean Lieutenant Gormley?

33:54.471 --> 33:56.104
Yes.

33:56.106 --> 33:57.305
You are the one
who promoted him.

33:57.307 --> 33:59.541
I know that.

33:59.543 --> 34:02.343
It's kind of my question.

34:02.345 --> 34:04.846
Do you think he has
what this takes?

34:04.848 --> 34:07.082
In terms of?

34:07.084 --> 34:09.650
Can he leave the need
to be liked down in the lobby

34:09.652 --> 34:13.188
when he comes to work up here?

34:19.463 --> 34:20.995
I think so.

34:20.996 --> 34:23.197
You do?

34:23.199 --> 34:26.000
Half his "just one of the guys"
act is an act.

34:26.002 --> 34:28.168
He's smart.

34:28.170 --> 34:31.505
And more ambitious for himself
than he wants to let on.

34:33.677 --> 34:35.143
I could be wrong.

34:36.112 --> 34:38.980
Have you ever said that
and actually meant it?

34:40.484 --> 34:42.217
No.

34:56.433 --> 34:58.433
Hey.

34:58.435 --> 35:01.069
It's over.

35:01.071 --> 35:02.737
Is that what they said?

35:02.739 --> 35:04.973
Pretty much.

35:04.975 --> 35:06.608
You want to talk to anyone?

35:06.610 --> 35:07.642
You want to see anyone?

35:07.644 --> 35:08.676
I'll break a rule.

35:08.678 --> 35:09.711
I'll get them up here.

35:09.713 --> 35:11.346
I got no one.

35:11.348 --> 35:13.414
A priest?

35:13.416 --> 35:15.250
Or a reverend?
Nah.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.721
They never did nothing for me.

35:20.557 --> 35:23.391
Okay.

35:26.830 --> 35:29.197
If there's a hell,

35:29.199 --> 35:31.266
I bet I go.

35:31.268 --> 35:34.402
You can still ask
for forgiveness.

35:34.404 --> 35:36.604
No, I think it's
a little late for that.

35:42.479 --> 35:44.612
But I can do this.

35:46.116 --> 35:48.750
Salzer's at his cousin Tommy...

35:48.752 --> 35:51.119
he's at his cousin
Tommy's place.

35:53.390 --> 35:56.157
39 Oak Street.

35:56.159 --> 35:59.027
New Hyde Park.

35:59.029 --> 36:02.363
Swear on my own grave.

36:02.365 --> 36:06.201
He's the one that shot the cop.

36:06.203 --> 36:07.802
Want to write that down for me?

36:07.804 --> 36:09.537
Sign it?

36:09.539 --> 36:11.406
Yeah.

36:29.326 --> 36:30.658
You're doing good, Wally.

36:30.660 --> 36:32.694
Yeah.

36:32.696 --> 36:34.829
Says you.

36:34.831 --> 36:38.466
Diego invited me
to his class one time.

36:38.468 --> 36:41.669
He taught the fourth grade
in the Bronx, poor school.

36:41.671 --> 36:44.138
Very chaotic
in the hallways.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.608
But these children,

36:46.610 --> 36:48.643
they listened to him.

36:48.645 --> 36:50.612
He was tough

36:50.614 --> 36:53.481
and gentle.

36:53.483 --> 36:55.350
And funny.

36:55.352 --> 36:57.252
Everybody loved him.

36:57.254 --> 36:58.486
Including you.

36:58.488 --> 37:00.488
Especially me.

37:00.490 --> 37:01.956
But not your father.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.291
Not at first.

37:03.293 --> 37:05.260
He's protective.

37:05.262 --> 37:07.729
But he grew to like Diego.

37:07.731 --> 37:10.098
He offered Diego money
to stay away from you.

37:10.100 --> 37:12.100
A lot of money.
Did you know about that?

37:12.102 --> 37:14.802
He did that
with other boyfriends, too.

37:14.804 --> 37:15.804
He did?

37:15.805 --> 37:16.905
I told you.

37:16.907 --> 37:19.674
He's very protective.

37:19.676 --> 37:22.877
Rada, honey...

37:22.879 --> 37:24.879
I'm really trying

37:24.881 --> 37:26.848
to understand
what happened here.

37:26.850 --> 37:28.116
And I agree with you.

37:28.118 --> 37:30.485
I don't believe Diego
was mixed up with drugs.

37:30.487 --> 37:32.487
I think they were planted.

37:32.489 --> 37:34.522
But who would do that?

37:34.524 --> 37:37.692
I don't know.

37:41.698 --> 37:43.398
Do you recognize this man?

37:45.702 --> 37:47.502
Oleg Kaus.

37:49.739 --> 37:52.040
He worked for my father
back in Moscow.

37:54.010 --> 37:56.210
Why are you showing me this?

38:00.283 --> 38:01.382
This was taken

38:01.384 --> 38:02.617
in the lobby of your building

38:02.619 --> 38:05.153
the day Diego was murdered.

38:05.155 --> 38:08.156
(exhales)

38:11.227 --> 38:13.061
Oh.

38:13.063 --> 38:14.862
No.

38:16.266 --> 38:18.266
(shuddering breath)

38:18.268 --> 38:20.335
My father?

38:20.337 --> 38:22.603
We can't prove it.
(exhales)

38:22.605 --> 38:24.973
But you can believe it?

38:25.842 --> 38:28.843
Rada, I'm so sorry.

38:28.845 --> 38:31.012
(crying)

38:47.063 --> 38:49.097
I have to leave now.

38:49.099 --> 38:51.199
No, please stay.

38:57.140 --> 38:59.073
No.

39:07.317 --> 39:10.385
Eddie.

39:13.857 --> 39:16.324
Wally, someone here to see you.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.600
(labored breathing)

39:27.570 --> 39:29.437
Mom?

39:32.275 --> 39:34.442
Hello, Wallace.

39:34.444 --> 39:36.644
(exhales)

39:40.016 --> 39:43.184
Mom.

39:56.366 --> 39:58.366
Oh.

40:00.737 --> 40:02.370
(stifled sob)

40:02.372 --> 40:04.505
(coughs)

40:04.507 --> 40:06.340
(sighs)

40:06.342 --> 40:07.809
Oh.

40:09.679 --> 40:11.679
(stifled sob)

40:11.681 --> 40:14.649
(sighs)

40:28.331 --> 40:29.964
How'd she get
into Diego's apartment?

40:29.966 --> 40:31.299
He gave her a key.

40:31.301 --> 40:33.000
Of course he did.

40:33.002 --> 40:35.169
(sighs)

40:51.087 --> 40:53.354
Live with yourself.

41:06.269 --> 41:08.636
I asked the building inspector
to look for violations

41:08.638 --> 41:10.938
in all of Weems' buildings.
Major?

41:10.940 --> 41:12.807
Major enough
to kill the deals.

41:12.809 --> 41:14.408
You think he's
underwater?

41:14.410 --> 41:16.644
Back of the napkin
figures? Drowning.

41:16.646 --> 41:19.080
Just don't ask me to do
anything else to the guy.

41:19.082 --> 41:20.581
You think
it's overkill?

41:20.583 --> 41:22.016
I don't question
your command.

41:22.018 --> 41:23.651
I didn't ask that.

41:23.653 --> 41:25.186
Lou.

41:28.658 --> 41:30.892
Sit down.

41:30.894 --> 41:33.161
What are you doing up here?

41:33.163 --> 41:36.564
Sid, I thought everything
was on the up and up.

41:36.566 --> 41:37.899
No, you didn't, Louis.

41:37.901 --> 41:39.600
Don't insult us.

41:39.602 --> 41:42.203
Sid tells me you're a savvy guy.

41:42.205 --> 41:45.540
Don't make a liar out of him.

41:46.376 --> 41:47.975
Okay.

41:47.977 --> 41:49.744
All right, I cut some corners.

41:49.746 --> 41:52.914
You're getting warmer.

41:54.884 --> 41:57.518
I just thought
that I'd ask an old friend

41:57.520 --> 41:59.253
to save my job.

41:59.255 --> 42:01.822
Every time I turn

42:01.824 --> 42:03.991
the corner,
I'm putting out another fire.

42:03.993 --> 42:07.361
It was all on the up and up,
Louis.

42:07.363 --> 42:09.363
I can't lose my job.

42:09.365 --> 42:12.233
Louis, that's not up to me.

42:12.235 --> 42:14.569
(sighs)

42:14.571 --> 42:17.205
Actually, it is.

42:17.207 --> 42:20.174
It is?

42:21.010 --> 42:24.212
In this instance.

42:28.685 --> 42:30.851
(sighs)

42:40.096 --> 42:42.763
Louis,

42:42.765 --> 42:45.800
you can keep your job.

42:45.802 --> 42:47.802
But one misstep,

42:47.804 --> 42:49.870
one cut corner,

42:49.872 --> 42:51.906
and you're gonna be
in the trial room

42:51.908 --> 42:54.242
fighting for that job!

42:57.914 --> 42:59.780
Thank you.

42:59.782 --> 43:02.116
Don't thank me.

43:02.118 --> 43:04.318
Thank him.
