00:01.918 --> 00:04.796
[Lucía] <i>Ever since I saw you,</i>
<i>your face has looked familiar to me.</i>

00:04.879 --> 00:06.881
<i>But it took seeing the bracelet</i>
<i>to understand.</i>

00:06.965 --> 00:08.216
PREVIOUSLY

00:08.299 --> 00:11.344
See these knots? When the last one
is untied, your travels are over.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.888
Your premise is very interesting.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.807
Yes, it's very personal.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.767
The workshop
is at the same time as the tour.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.146
If she's chosen,
she'll quit Eleven O'Clock.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.982
-Where's Caterina now?
-She's meeting with Oliverio Gerard.

00:24.566 --> 00:25.567
[Oliverio] Hello?

00:25.650 --> 00:28.111
Oliverio,
I wanted to propose something to you.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.532
I'm very sorry.
You're not ready for my workshop.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.617
-[Caterina] <i>I thought you were my friend.</i>
-It's not what you think.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.203
I quit Eleven O'Clock.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.415
The most important thing to remember

00:40.498 --> 00:44.753
is that this isn't
your place or your time, Allegra.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.551
[Allegra] It must be a mistake.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.262
[Félix] That's why we couldn't find
any information about him on the Internet.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.307
And remember the dedication in Diego's CD.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.643
"Wherever you are,
your music will always be with me."

01:01.561 --> 01:02.729
It's no mistake.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.191
Marco is dead.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.234
But how did it happen?

01:09.444 --> 01:10.820
Does it matter?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.030
Of course it matters.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.033
If this is true, then Marco died in 1994.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.328
I think you're getting a little obsessed.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.662
You barely knew him.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.583
[sighs]
There's something that ties me to Marco.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.960
I feel like he understands me and--

01:26.044 --> 01:30.048
Well, so now some random guy from the past
understands you better than I do.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.883
I didn't say that!

01:32.842 --> 01:35.762
And don't get all jealous,
because Marco and you aren't rivals.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.473
You're my best friend. And Marco is my…

01:40.266 --> 01:42.310
Your what? Marco is what?

01:43.770 --> 01:45.647
I need to find out what happened to him.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.412
INTERTWINED

02:12.966 --> 02:13.967
Mom.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.386
Were you speaking to me?

02:16.469 --> 02:17.470
Wait.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.561
You still remember.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.565
Twenty years hearing
that the best thing for vocal cords

02:28.648 --> 02:32.402
is a little honey in the morning
and a little before going to sleep.

02:33.820 --> 02:34.821
Thank you.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.661
It was very moving
to visit my mother's grave.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.292
Why didn't you come to see her before?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.672
I tried,
but I had unavoidable commitments.

02:52.756 --> 02:53.757
Unavoidable.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.843
Your catchphrase.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.847
What do you expect from me, Caterina?

03:00.930 --> 03:03.183
Couldn't you at least be
a little considerate?

03:04.768 --> 03:08.605
Do you think it's easy for me to not have
been at my mother's side when she died?

03:08.688 --> 03:12.108
I regret it every day,
but there's nothing I can do.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.945
And having you constantly repeat it to me
doesn't change things.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.325
[Caterina sighs]

03:23.661 --> 03:26.873
You're angry and disappointed, I know.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.711
But it's been more than 20 years,
Caterina.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.552
It's not just about Grandmother,
and you know it.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.932
All I know is that ever since I arrived,
you've been treating me like an intruder.

03:44.974 --> 03:49.145
-Why can't you leave the past behind?
-I don't know how to explain it to you.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.397
I don't understand you, Caterina.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.858
I've been preparing you to be
the new musical theater star for years,

03:53.942 --> 03:56.736
and when everything is within reach,
you quit.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.238
I want to write, Mom.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.700
You want me to believe that you're
turning your back on your entire career

04:01.783 --> 04:03.910
to devote yourself to a hobby?

04:03.993 --> 04:06.246
It's not a hobby!
It's what I want to do with my life!

04:07.455 --> 04:11.126
Caterina, you have everything
to be my successor. Don't throw it away.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.962
I don't want to be your successor.
I want to be your daughter.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.422
But you are my daughter.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.882
You're the daughter of Cocó Sharp.

04:17.966 --> 04:18.967
Act like it.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.470
If you treated me like your daughter,

04:22.554 --> 04:24.764
you wouldn't have forgotten
that today is my birthday.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.767
What do you mean, it's your birthday?

04:27.851 --> 04:29.269
But your birthday is--

04:29.352 --> 04:31.688
Believe it or not, it's once a year.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.523
[both sigh]

04:34.774 --> 04:36.067
[doorbell rings]

04:36.151 --> 04:38.820
What's going on?
Where are you going with all that?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.697
It's time to leave.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.410
You can't throw Cocó out.
She has to stay with us.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.495
Oh, really? For what?

04:47.579 --> 04:50.498
So she can cover for you when you lie
to me? When you go to auditions?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.167
She's the only one who supports me.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.711
You had your grandmother.
Why can't I have mine?

04:54.794 --> 04:57.047
Allegra,
this is the best for all three of us.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.173
Not for me.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.348
I spent most of my life on tour,

05:07.140 --> 05:10.268
saying goodbye to people
whom I loved very much.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.106
But I never had to say goodbye
to my granddaughter.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.701
This is not a finale.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.454
Let's consider it an intermezzo.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.164
[doorbell rings]

05:50.642 --> 05:51.643
[door opens]

05:54.020 --> 05:55.146
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

05:56.690 --> 05:58.316
Would it have been so hard if she stayed?

05:58.400 --> 06:02.737
Allegra, my relationship
with your grandmother is complex.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.781
For once,
I'd like you to respect my decisions.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.158
Sure. I will when you respect mine.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.453
I'm sorry you feel that way.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.790
But you don't know Cocó the way I do.
She's not what she seems.

06:13.873 --> 06:14.958
What are you saying?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.377
That it's better for you
to keep your distance from her,

06:17.460 --> 06:18.878
from her world, from…

06:19.921 --> 06:20.922
Trust me.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.590
I'll trust you when you tell me the truth.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.343
What happened between you?

06:26.344 --> 06:27.721
Enough, Allegra.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.597
I prefer to leave that in the past.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.101
But it affects my future.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.773
[door closes]

06:39.733 --> 06:41.693
Magic Ink

06:48.950 --> 06:50.243
-[creepy chords play]
-[sighs]

06:50.952 --> 06:52.328
Can you stop doing that?

06:52.412 --> 06:55.749
Easy. I'm trying out sounds
for the jump scares in the short.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.792
-[typing]
-Jump what?

06:57.876 --> 07:00.545
[scoffs] Let's see. How can I explain?

07:00.628 --> 07:05.258
They're those moments when the lead
thinks that they're safe… [clicks tongue]

07:05.342 --> 07:08.094
…but suddenly the murderer shows up
behind them and grabs them and does…

07:08.178 --> 07:09.846
[grunts] …for the final attack.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.139
And that's very good?

07:11.222 --> 07:13.850
Yeah, but right now I'm not sure
what's the point, you know?

07:14.559 --> 07:16.853
Don't say that, Félix.
Everything's going to be okay.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.358
Yeah, but to win the scholarship I need
a short that leaves them speechless.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.693
And to film a short
that leaves them speechless,

07:23.777 --> 07:27.155
I need a lead who leaves me speechless.
Hmm?

07:27.655 --> 07:30.575
And a location, too.
And the way things are going, I don't…

07:31.659 --> 07:34.079
Can I ask what you're doing, huh?

07:35.413 --> 07:38.166
-After arguing with my mom--
-For the umpteenth time.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.419
I see things more clearly.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.674
Before, I thought that she was frustrated
because she didn't get the part of Ellie--

07:45.757 --> 07:48.426
-But when you helped her get it, she quit.
-Exactly.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.847
So, the problem is the relationship
between my mom and my grandma.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.432
And that's what I need to fix.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.395
Of course, my mom hates my grandma
because she never listened to her

07:58.478 --> 08:00.605
and never let her do
what she truly wanted.

08:00.689 --> 08:01.690
Okay.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.068
And my mom is afraid that history
will repeat itself,

08:05.151 --> 08:06.778
and I'll let Cocó manipulate me.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.655
I'm not surprised she thinks that.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.990
Cocó got her dropped
from the literary workshop.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.785
And you had something to do with that,
remember?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.870
No, kids, cut, cut.
We've already shot that scene.

08:15.954 --> 08:19.624
Kids, we're going to have to reshoot
because the actress doesn't get it.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.792
You need to be careful.

08:20.875 --> 08:24.838
Playing with time can have consequences.
And you know that very well.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.840
Yes, but this time,
I'll be better prepared.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.009
-[sighs]
-I'm going to fix my mistake

08:29.092 --> 08:31.594
and I'm going to help my grandma
and my mom become friends.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.305
And to do that I need…

08:38.601 --> 08:39.644
This.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.034
[bracelet whirring]

08:59.998 --> 09:02.792
[panting]

09:03.877 --> 09:05.211
[door opens]

09:06.546 --> 09:09.049
Great. [chuckles]

09:09.132 --> 09:12.218
Not only are you a traitor,
you're out of place.

09:12.302 --> 09:15.305
I came in through the window.
Sorry, I didn't want to run into Cocó.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.141
And I don't want to run into you.
So you'd better leave.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.019
Please, Caterina, I need to apologize.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.730
You made a mistake coming here,
because I don't feel sorry for you.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.941
I thought you were missing the opportunity
of a lifetime by quitting the company.

09:27.942 --> 09:31.071
The opportunity of my lifetime was
the workshop with Oliverio Gerard.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.531
I know. I didn't get it, but I do now.

09:33.615 --> 09:37.494
Great. If you wouldn't mind, next time
try to understand what's going on

09:37.577 --> 09:39.621
before playing chess with my future.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.332
I thought you were my friend.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.585
I shouldn't have trusted
a complete stranger.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.505
I have no idea who you are, Laura.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.925
And I'm not interested in knowing.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.259
Don't come back.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.061
[door closes]

10:08.566 --> 10:10.235
[Lucía] <i>It was a tough blow for Caterina.</i>

10:11.277 --> 10:12.570
-She feels--
-Betrayed.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.865
I know.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.745
[sighs] I thought I was here to help her
to win the part of Ellie.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.332
Perhaps the bracelet
tried to show you something,

10:24.416 --> 10:25.750
but you didn't understand.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.380
I was very selfish. And now it's too late.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.925
It's never too late. Time is an illusion.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.095
But I don't have that many trips left.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.348
[sighs] I need your help.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.560
You're the only one who understands
how this works.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.062
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do.

10:46.813 --> 10:50.233
It's up to you to discover
why the bracelet brought you to this time.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.820
What are the knots in your own history
that you need to untie.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.324
Although, there is something
you can do for me.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.204
[Cocó]
It's just how I envisioned it. I love it.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.081
[Cocó and Tomás laugh]

11:05.165 --> 11:06.458
It's very good, Tomás.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.918
It's very good. This is what I wanted.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.671
We can project the effect
of the body switching here.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.341
Ellie here, Katherine over there.

11:14.424 --> 11:18.053
The mapping projections will cause
the magic to dwell on the actresses.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.471
-Do you understand, Tomás?
-Ah.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.515
We'll also use it for the last scene,

11:22.599 --> 11:25.518
the return to normal,
the union between mother and daughter.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.687
I want the whole set
to focus on the two of them.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.772
[dialing phone]

11:28.855 --> 11:32.609
We'll have to look for
different visual planes, right? [laughs]

11:34.319 --> 11:35.987
Hello, this is Tomás Diz.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.323
Hi, how are you?

11:38.406 --> 11:41.493
I wanted to ask if it was possible
to increase my line of credit.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.577
-Look, Tomás.
-Yes.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.246
-Look, Tomás. [laughs]
-Very good. [laughs]

11:45.330 --> 11:46.623
-Isn't it great?
-Very good.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.628
[Marco] Are you okay?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.881
Yes, why?

11:54.964 --> 11:57.050
You've said four words since you arrived.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.427
And how many should I have said?

12:00.261 --> 12:04.474
If you reach 100,
you win a scratched Radiohead CD.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.727
You can also redeem the prize for a kiss.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.313
Mmm. I think I'll stick with Radiohead.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.691
[chuckles, coughs]

12:12.774 --> 12:14.901
Are you okay?
Do you want me to call a doctor?

12:14.984 --> 12:19.072
Whoa. It's just allergies.
Probably the dust.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.574
I didn't know that you were
such a hypochondriac.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.662
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.207
I'm fine. I never get sick.

12:29.290 --> 12:35.171
And you should find a more entertaining
way to reach 100 words, right?

12:38.550 --> 12:39.843
How's the band?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.095
I didn't tell you?
We're going to record a demo.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.639
Seriously? And do you already know
which song you're going to record?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.809
Let's just say that
we don't see eye to eye on that.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.228
Diego is obsessed with recording his song.

12:50.311 --> 12:54.190
And I want to do new things,
record new sounds.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.320
-I know. It sounds ridiculous.
-Not at all.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.323
What's more, to me it sounds visionary.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.660
Everything can be music.

13:05.744 --> 13:11.750
If you think about it, there are melodies
in the street, in the wind.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.671
Even in this very grown-up piggy bank
you have here.

13:17.422 --> 13:18.715
[coins rattle]

13:18.798 --> 13:20.508
What's inside? Your life savings?

13:21.384 --> 13:23.553
[coins rattle]

13:24.971 --> 13:26.056
I love talking to you.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.349
[chuckles] Same.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.102
What? You talk funny.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.772
It means that I feel the same way.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.692
But now I want to analyze

13:37.776 --> 13:43.156
this sophisticated financial
receptacle mechanism.

13:43.990 --> 13:47.202
You're really reaching
to get up to 100 words, huh?

13:47.285 --> 13:48.953
It's very possible. How far am I?

13:49.788 --> 13:51.915
You know what? I've lost count.

13:52.499 --> 13:56.670
And I just remembered
that I left the scratched CD at home.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.932
[Caterina] <i>She thought that she was</i>
<i>capable of defeating destiny.</i>

14:09.808 --> 14:14.813
<i>With it, she was going to write a future</i>
<i>in which they would always be together.</i>

14:15.730 --> 14:16.731
[Cocó] <i>Attention!</i>

14:16.815 --> 14:17.816
[chattering]

14:17.899 --> 14:19.484
Before we begin today's rehearsal,

14:19.567 --> 14:22.070
I want to talk about what happened
with Caterina.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.281
What is there to talk about?
She quit. That's very clear.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.368
Nobody quit. Caterina had a crisis.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.786
<i>It could happen to anyone.</i>

14:30.412 --> 14:34.541
And she is recovering, and very soon
she'll be back with us, better than ever.

14:35.125 --> 14:39.212
Meanwhile, Greta, you'll play Ellie…

14:40.630 --> 14:42.966
and Bárbara, you'll play Savannah.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.593
-[student] Bárbara, of course.
-[Allegra] And what if it wasn't a crisis?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.930
What if she really doesn't want to stay
in the company?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.893
I know my daughter very well.

14:53.977 --> 14:58.940
It's very common for young actors
to get stage fright before opening day.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.444
To your positions.
Let's begin our rehearsal.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.033
[Caterina] <i>Luz kept going,</i>

15:08.116 --> 15:11.786
<i>moving through the invisible spiderweb</i>
<i>of time,</i>

15:12.412 --> 15:15.081
<i>becoming increasingly tangled</i>
<i>in its threads.</i>

15:33.516 --> 15:36.561

<i>the warnings about lost loves.</i>

15:47.072 --> 15:49.866
[Caterina] <i>She gave in to her feelings,</i>

15:50.867 --> 15:54.079

<i>that awaited her.</i>

15:56.206 --> 15:57.248
[Cocó] <i>Okay, gather 'round.</i>

15:58.124 --> 15:59.125
[student] Again?

15:59.209 --> 16:01.086
[Cocó]
You need a lot more energy and precision.

16:01.169 --> 16:04.130
Every passing day,
we get closer to opening.

16:04.214 --> 16:08.885
Starting today,
I need you to breathe <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.762
That's it for today.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.766
[chattering]

16:16.518 --> 16:17.644
Come on. Come with me.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.021
What are you up to?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.607
I have some urgent business.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.819
Have you got my back?

16:25.902 --> 16:27.654
[scoffs] Have I ever failed you?

16:31.366 --> 16:32.742
Hey. Hey, wait.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.786
I have something important to tell you.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.873
[Dante] I don't know what she sings.
I don't know. Probably.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.458
-Dante.
-Diego.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.626
So that we keep this.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.214
[man] Excuse me. What else do you have?

16:46.297 --> 16:49.050
[Dante] Well, okay, and if not,
I can offer you Roxette.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.177
-[man] Great.
-[Dante] Yeah, I love it.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.888
-[man] Let's see.
-If you're a fan of Soda Stereo, get this.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.390
[man] Yeah, honestly, I love it.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.018
Hi.

16:58.810 --> 16:59.811
[laughs]

17:01.271 --> 17:02.355
Hi, love!

17:02.439 --> 17:04.024
-How are you?
-Huh?

17:04.107 --> 17:05.775
You're shouting.

17:05.859 --> 17:06.901
Sorry!

17:07.819 --> 17:09.070
Don't worry about it!

17:10.238 --> 17:12.365
-Aren't you going to greet me?
-Yes.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.828
Do you have something to tell me?

17:17.829 --> 17:20.165
Yes. Yes, that…

17:21.416 --> 17:22.876
You look really pretty today.

17:24.919 --> 17:25.920
And?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.715
And that…

17:29.883 --> 17:33.928
Did you come to see me
or do you want a CD?

17:35.055 --> 17:39.059
[sighs] I came to ask you
if you have plans this afternoon.

17:39.726 --> 17:44.898
I don't know, we could go to the movies,
or walk by the river.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.568
Yeah.
We could also go to your place, right?

17:48.651 --> 17:49.652
What do you think?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.615
Yes. Yes, that's a good idea,

17:54.449 --> 17:58.286
but the last thing I want today
is to run into my mom.

17:59.454 --> 18:02.457
[chattering]

18:05.919 --> 18:07.962
-There. What do you think?
-[gasps]

18:08.838 --> 18:11.549
It's fine. Okay, I'd better finish.
Get down. You could get hurt.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.926
I'm a meter off the ground.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.135
Please get down.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.016
I just don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.144
What's wrong?
Are you so afraid of losing me?

18:23.228 --> 18:25.105
-[door closes]
-[gasps, shushes]

18:25.188 --> 18:26.731

Get down. Get down.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.487
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

[all groan]

18:33.863 --> 18:35.281
Ah.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.326
It's you. What are you doing here?

18:38.410 --> 18:40.745
We came to the party.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.790
This looks more like
a dentist's waiting room than a party.

18:43.873 --> 18:49.087
No, you're wrong, girls.
This is a birthday party, not a gala.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.881
Your look is a little basic for my taste.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.509
-The only basic thing is your personality.
-[door opens, closes]

18:54.592 --> 18:57.095
[Marco] Here they come. Here they come.
Girls, hide. Hide.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.975
[Caterina] And then we can
get a snack. Anyway, we've got time. And--

19:02.058 --> 19:04.144
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

19:04.227 --> 19:05.311
Whoa!

19:05.395 --> 19:09.566
Thanks. I didn't expect this.
I thought that you had forgotten.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.068
-Wow!
-[boy] Happy birthday!

19:12.152 --> 19:13.903
Thanks. You're so sweet.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.531
-My friend, happy birthday.
-Thank you.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.575
I owe you a present.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.411
I did bring you a present. Happy birthday.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.957
An arcade pass.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.376
Now that you're not going to be
in the company,

19:28.460 --> 19:30.086
you'll have a lot of free time.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.297
What a nice gesture.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.354
but you managed to get
nearly the entire cast here.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.481
I'm going to have to cook some more food.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.524
It wasn't that hard.
Everyone adores Caterina.

19:51.608 --> 19:52.609
[Lucía chuckles]

19:52.692 --> 19:54.652
[Allegra] Well, nearly everyone.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.574
Do you need me to help you
with anything else before I go?

19:59.657 --> 20:00.909
What? You're not staying?

20:01.409 --> 20:03.661
I don't think Caterina
will be happy to see me.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.955
I'd better get back to the kitchen.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.417
Burnt chicken appetizers
aren't very tasty. [chuckles]

20:15.423 --> 20:17.801
[tuts] Were you escaping again?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.845
Things aren't very good with Caterina.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.431
I'll explain later. Be careful.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.017
What's going on?

20:26.101 --> 20:28.603
You're talking to me
like you're afraid of something.

20:29.771 --> 20:30.772
Just ignore me.

I thought that we agreed
that we were going to record my song.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.564
What if we write a new one?

There's music everywhere
if you open your mind a little, Diego.

You know what? I'm not going to argue.

22:09.621 --> 22:10.622
Me neither.

-Bárbara, this isn't funny.
-It is funny.

22:42.237 --> 22:45.115
Don't drink any more. If Cocó finds out,
not even your daddy can save you.

[laughing]

22:57.043 --> 22:58.503
You know what I was thinking?

Now that the part of Ellie is mine
and that…

Well, I'm going to be
a little more relaxed…

Maybe we can make up for
the time we lost fighting.

Yeah, I think that
maybe you're a little confused.

-[boy] What's up? All good?

23:28.658 --> 23:30.326
Do you need me to spell it out for you?

I don't think it's a good idea.

Happy birthday.

I have a super special surprise for you.

I know that you're going through
a hard time,

24:08.323 --> 24:11.868

another one of your disasters.

Caterina was very excited
about the workshop.

Nobody is doubting Caterina's talent.

I know that you didn't accept Caterina
at Cocó's request.

was going to be the lead on opening day.

Cocó, Caterina is irreplaceable.
She can't leave.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.287
Caterina will still be part of the show.

27:02.163 --> 27:03.873
So then, she didn't quit?
I don't understand.

27:03.957 --> 27:07.293
Yes, but it's not a problem.
It's not important.

27:07.377 --> 27:09.004
It's just teenage capriciousness.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.131
What you're saying
isn't making me feel any better.

If you're so worried about Caterina
participating in the show,

38:13.543 --> 38:15.920
so that you can join the company here,
now, in the present.

38:16.004 --> 38:18.131
Cocó already left. There's no point.

38:19.299 --> 38:23.678
I thought that I could help them
make up in '94, but…

38:24.429 --> 38:25.597
But what?

38:27.307 --> 38:28.975
Cocó isn't who I thought she was.

38:29.476 --> 38:31.394
Or at least, she wasn't in the past.

38:32.062 --> 38:34.939
I idolized her. I don't know. I was wrong.

38:35.940 --> 38:38.401
[bracelet whirring]

38:38.485 --> 38:42.113
[metal scraping, clink]

38:42.197 --> 38:43.239
Of course.

38:44.616 --> 38:46.826
I always thought that my mom
was the problem.

38:47.369 --> 38:48.370
But it's Cocó.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.372
I'll never get her to change.

38:53.208 --> 38:56.628
When I spoke to Cocó, she told me
that Ellie had to be played by a Sharp.

38:57.879 --> 38:59.255
So, what are you going to do?

39:06.680 --> 39:07.764
[Cocó] Caterina.

39:08.390 --> 39:10.183
-The witch is back.
-Caterina, please.

39:10.266 --> 39:11.476
Leave her alone, Mom.

39:11.559 --> 39:13.978
Caterina has a reason
for being angry with me.

39:14.813 --> 39:16.398
That's why I came to apologize.

39:16.981 --> 39:18.942
I'm very sorry for what happened today.

39:19.943 --> 39:22.070
I still don't know how I could forget
your birthday.

39:22.987 --> 39:24.447
That's all you're sorry for?

39:26.616 --> 39:27.909
I brought you a gift.

39:30.036 --> 39:31.037
I hope you like it.

39:39.254 --> 39:41.423
It will help you to connect
with the character.

39:43.216 --> 39:45.427
You don't understand anything.

39:46.052 --> 39:48.972
I don't want to play Ellie!
How can I make you understand?

39:49.055 --> 39:51.433
Calm down, Caterina.
And speak to me with more respect, please.

39:51.516 --> 39:52.892
You don't respect me.

39:52.976 --> 39:56.688
You don't respect my decisions.
I don't want to be part of your world.

39:56.771 --> 39:59.232
You're not capable of making
a single responsible decision.

39:59.315 --> 40:01.943
-Just look at what you did today--
-[doorbell rings]

40:02.027 --> 40:03.361
I didn't do anything wrong.

40:03.445 --> 40:05.405
I just celebrated my birthday
with my friends.

40:05.488 --> 40:08.116
If I hadn't arrived, they would have
destroyed the house. Caterina, please.

40:08.199 --> 40:10.702
Cocó, I need to talk to you.

40:10.785 --> 40:13.079
-This is not a good time. Please--
-It's important.

40:15.081 --> 40:17.250
Okay. Speak.

40:20.795 --> 40:22.213
I wanted to tell you that…

40:24.674 --> 40:25.717
That…

40:26.593 --> 40:28.136
-[Cocó] Go on.
-[sighs]

40:29.179 --> 40:31.890
I know who needs to play the lead
in <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

40:35.018 --> 40:36.061
[sighs]

40:38.229 --> 40:39.230
Me.
