WEBVTT

00:00.469 --> 00:04.737
Gee wheeze, the Harvest Festival
was a real triumph.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.990
We had over 80,000 people
in attendance.

00:08.074 --> 00:11.477
Which surpassed our wildest
expectations.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.997
I would like to specifically
single out Leslie Knope.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.450
I speak for the Mayor,
City Council,

00:17.501 --> 00:19.719
and all of Pawnee
when I say

00:19.786 --> 00:21.487
we can't wait to see
what the heck

00:21.555 --> 00:23.589
you're gonna do next.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.291
Ugh.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.792
Step on up here, Les.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.630
Thank you.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.298
Paul, are you okay?

00:32.365 --> 00:33.833
Uh...

00:35.085 --> 00:37.053
Oh! Oh!

00:37.137 --> 00:38.888
- Oh, my God.
- Holy...

00:38.972 --> 00:39.889
Oh, my God.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.044
That was... the second
most awkward way

00:45.112 --> 00:47.480
a man has ever
grabbed my breast.

00:47.548 --> 00:58.483

01:07.634 --> 01:09.085
All right, guys,
everybody listen up.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.254
Just a few notes about
our camping retreat tomorrow.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.456
We're all gonna meet here
and leave as a group

01:13.540 --> 01:15.875
at 6:45 A.M., promptly.

01:15.926 --> 01:17.376
Why are we doing this?

01:17.427 --> 01:18.578
Harvest fest is over.

01:18.645 --> 01:19.879
We do not want to have
a sophomore slump.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.447
This camping trip
is our chance

01:21.515 --> 01:23.583
to think of some really
big ideas.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.685
Why don't you just tell us
what our next project is,

01:25.752 --> 01:27.286
and I'll go camping
by myself.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.055
Look, I have ideas,
Ron, okay?

01:29.106 --> 01:30.590
I have like a hundred new ideas.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.491
But the point is,
the pressure is on.

01:32.559 --> 01:35.561
We only have one chance
to make a second impression.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.164
What portion of this camping
trip will take place outside?

01:38.231 --> 01:39.532
- All of it.
- Pass.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.767
Can't pass,
it's a mandatory work retreat.

01:41.818 --> 01:42.835
I have a question.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.470
What if we're
scaling a cliff

01:44.538 --> 01:46.272
and I start to fall?

01:46.340 --> 01:48.074
Can I grab onto your boob
for support?

01:48.141 --> 01:50.509
No, Tom, don't!
Her boob kills!

01:50.577 --> 01:52.478
My boob does not kill.
Paul did not die.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.581
He had a heart attack which
required an octuple bypass.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.684
Besides, the <i>Pawnee Sun</i>
said that my chest

01:58.752 --> 02:01.137
saved his life.

02:02.221 --> 02:04.624
How's the best municipal
department in Pawnee?

02:04.691 --> 02:05.808
That's you guys?

02:05.892 --> 02:08.327
Paul is going to be recuperating
for a while.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.364
So the Mayor asked me
to step in as city manager.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.599
And I, of course,
accepted immediately

02:13.667 --> 02:16.402
because Pawnee is literally

02:16.469 --> 02:18.604
the greatest town
in the country.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.773
Of course, I am gonna miss
Indianapolis,

02:20.824 --> 02:23.376
which is the most wonderful
city in America.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.578
I'm so excited to be
working with you all again.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.863
And, Leslie,
I cannot wait

02:27.948 --> 02:29.165
to hear your new big idea.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.683
I want to hit the ground
running,

02:30.751 --> 02:32.418
and your new mystery project

02:32.485 --> 02:34.120
is going to be
the hydration pack

02:34.171 --> 02:35.287
that gets me
to the finish line.

02:35.339 --> 02:37.489
You're all my little
hydration packs.

02:37.541 --> 02:39.825
I'm sure I am not.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.711
Ron!

02:41.795 --> 02:43.029
You are too.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.864
Hydration pack!

02:48.435 --> 02:50.102
Hey, you gotta hear
this hilarious story

02:50.170 --> 02:51.504
that he's telling me...
tell her what happened.

02:51.571 --> 02:54.640
- My identity was stolen.
- His identity was stolen!

02:55.976 --> 02:57.777
Tell her about the accounts.

02:57.844 --> 02:58.944
They were frozen.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.647
Frozen.

03:01.698 --> 03:03.482
Bye, Kyle.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.917
Where you going?

03:04.985 --> 03:06.351
Oh, my God.

03:06.403 --> 03:08.037
Heh.
How's the coolest chick ever?

03:08.121 --> 03:09.071
Not good.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.389
What do you mean?

03:10.457 --> 03:12.158
Leslie's making us go
on a camping retreat.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.993
That's awesome!
Camping's the best.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.327
Camping sucks.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.413
It's super-boring.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.398
And you can see the stars,
which I hate.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.499
They're creepy.

03:20.567 --> 03:21.567
I love camping.

03:21.635 --> 03:22.968
I betcha I could get you
to love it too.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.236
Why don't I meet you
out there?

03:24.304 --> 03:25.971
If you hate it, we'll leave
and go make out.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.808
But if you love it,
we'll stay and make out.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.676
Either way,
a ton of making out.

03:30.727 --> 03:32.244
You in?

03:33.730 --> 03:35.247
- Anne Perkins!
- Chris.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.550
Hey.
I heard you were back.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.684
Yeah.

03:38.735 --> 03:40.019
I didn't do this
because of you.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.887
Uh, well, it looks great.

03:41.938 --> 03:44.774
Yeah, you look great.
Am I right? It's...

03:44.858 --> 03:45.941
So good running into you.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.126
You know, we should
get together soon.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.127
I'd love to catch up.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.228
Me too!

03:49.296 --> 03:51.230
Ketchup and mustard.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.732
Ketchup and mustard,
I just was...

03:53.784 --> 03:55.234
Oh!

03:55.285 --> 03:56.619
That is so delightful.

03:56.703 --> 03:59.121
I relish your wit.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.876
Well, I salsa...
your face.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.846
I should hate him.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.080
He broke up with me.

04:08.131 --> 04:09.932
Well, there was an ex
that I still liked

04:10.016 --> 04:11.183
after he broke up with me,

04:11.251 --> 04:12.985
but it was really hard
to stay mad at him.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.321
He was an amazing dentist.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.624
You know, when he saw me,
I swear his face lit up.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.226
- Ann...
- What do you think

04:20.293 --> 04:21.444
"we should get together soon"
means?

04:21.528 --> 04:23.229
No, do not read into this.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.865
Remember, this is the guy
that was so upbeat and positive,

04:25.932 --> 04:26.999
when he broke up with you,

04:27.067 --> 04:28.067
you didn't even know
it happened.

04:28.118 --> 04:29.568
Yeah.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.137
Come camping with us.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.239
It'll be really fun.
You'll be away from Chris.

04:33.290 --> 04:34.773
You can brainstorm.

04:34.825 --> 04:38.711
I'll give you first dibs
on s'mores.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.212
Okay.
That sounds fun.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.466
Here is our official
retreat schedule.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.084
It divides our time evenly

04:45.135 --> 04:46.852
between work and play.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.504
Come on, everybody,
let's hustle.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.622
Let's get
to the brainstorming.

04:50.674 --> 04:52.758
Great attitude, Ron!

04:52.809 --> 04:54.677
I just wanna get the work
over as soon as possible

04:54.761 --> 04:56.662
so I can do some fishing.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.463
Fishing relaxes me.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.199
It's like yoga,

05:00.267 --> 05:02.351
except I still get to kill
something.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.839
All right, I...

05:06.907 --> 05:09.825
Call this wonderful spot.

05:09.910 --> 05:10.993
You didn't bring a tent?

05:11.077 --> 05:13.279
I don't really go camping,
ever, Jerry,

05:13.346 --> 05:15.881
so I'm not gonna spend
$150 on a tent.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.649
Just gonna sleep
on the floor.

05:17.701 --> 05:19.702
It's called the ground
when it's outside.

05:19.786 --> 05:20.786
Whatever. Why?

05:20.837 --> 05:22.654
Do you guys do this a lot?
Camping?

05:22.706 --> 05:24.790
I've never been before,
but I think I'm gonna love it.

05:24.841 --> 05:26.826
Why am I gonna love it?

05:26.893 --> 05:28.761
<i>Skymall!</i>

05:28.828 --> 05:30.129
Come check out my tent.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.031
I ordered a bunch of crap
off <i>Skymall.</i>

05:32.098 --> 05:34.717
I got my TV, my XBox, DVD.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.385
Awesome bed right there.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.304
DJ Rumba's in the mix.

05:38.355 --> 05:40.672
Ah, it's like
I'm not even camping.

05:40.724 --> 05:43.375
This is actually a dog couch,
but it's super comfortable.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.281
It's really important to me
that April loves camping,

05:49.349 --> 05:52.017
so I went ahead
and set up the ultimate

05:52.068 --> 05:54.220
campsite love nest.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.022
Complete with beautiful
starlight.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.023
You got champagne.

05:58.074 --> 05:59.491
Also, rose petals.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.661
As you can see,
they smell terrific.

06:02.712 --> 06:04.797
We need big ideas,
and we need 'em now.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.165
Who wants to go first?

06:06.216 --> 06:08.834
I propose that we take
all the money we made

06:08.885 --> 06:10.502
from the Harvest Festival

06:10.570 --> 06:12.571
and return it
to the citizens.

06:12.639 --> 06:13.806
So how much would
that be per person?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.575
About 83 cents.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.344
Per household.

06:18.395 --> 06:19.728
Before postage.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.398
Are we done?

06:22.482 --> 06:24.216
What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne,

06:24.267 --> 06:25.434
and Drake
all have in common?

06:25.518 --> 06:26.785
Oh, I know this one.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.587
They are all rap-pists.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.223
Oh, my God,
they're <i>Rappers,</i> Jerry!

06:31.274 --> 06:33.359
What they have in common
is none of them

06:33.410 --> 06:34.827
have ever
performed in Pawnee.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.894
Why?

06:35.946 --> 06:37.830
Because we don't have

06:37.897 --> 06:39.915
an adequate concert venue.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.401
Until now.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.902
The Pawnee Amphitheater!

06:43.954 --> 06:45.905
How much would that cost?

06:45.972 --> 06:47.806
Not that much.
$200, $300 million.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.708
- Right.
- Great.

06:49.759 --> 06:52.244
Luxury Dog Park.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.413
Do you wanna
tell us anymore?

06:54.481 --> 06:56.115
Poodles only.

06:56.182 --> 06:57.216
No pooping.

06:58.468 --> 07:00.252
Hey. Where are you?

07:00.303 --> 07:02.104
I'm here.
Where are you?

07:02.188 --> 07:03.939
We're inside
the main entrance.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.225
Near the sign that says
Pawnee campground.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.926
Oh...

07:07.978 --> 07:09.395
I'm in a totally
different place.

07:09.446 --> 07:11.063
That's why we can't
see each other.

07:11.114 --> 07:12.564
My God, Andy.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.099
I don't even
want to be here.

07:14.150 --> 07:15.434
The air is too fresh.

07:15.485 --> 07:17.436
It's disgusting.
I can't breathe.

07:17.487 --> 07:19.638
There's a brook somewhere
that won't stop babbling.

07:19.706 --> 07:20.940
Shut up!

07:21.007 --> 07:22.541
Sweetheart,
just hold tight.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.543
And, uh, I'll be there.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.478
Well, April is right here.

07:26.546 --> 07:29.982
And I...Am
down here somewhere.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.001
How 'bout we just
invest the money?

07:32.085 --> 07:33.719
Make 4% a year.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.620
You know, set up a nice little
nest egg for the city.

07:35.672 --> 07:36.722
What do you think?

07:36.789 --> 07:38.974
Great idea.
Thanks, white Urkel.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.360
All right, maybe it's not
the sexiest idea, Todd,

07:41.428 --> 07:42.928
but it's smart.

07:42.979 --> 07:44.263
What are you even
still doing here?

07:44.331 --> 07:45.731
Harvest Festival is over.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.433
Shouldn't you be back
in Indianapolis?

07:47.484 --> 07:49.902
Ben helped us launch
the Harvest Festival,

07:49.970 --> 07:51.654
and he knows how
Chris's mind works,

07:51.738 --> 07:53.372
and he's a valuable asset
to the team.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.523
Thank you.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.642
April has not presented
her idea... April.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.676
I didn't come up
with anything.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.161
- Why?
- Because!

07:59.245 --> 08:00.279
I know that whatever
we come up with

08:00.330 --> 08:01.413
isn't gonna be
good enough anyway.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.814
We're just gonna
go with your idea.

08:02.866 --> 08:04.483
She's got a point.

08:04.534 --> 08:06.085
Leslie, just tell us
what your idea is,

08:06.152 --> 08:07.652
so I can go back
to the thunderdome.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.338
That's what
I'm calling my tent.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.156
I am really disappointed
in all of you.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.375
You know, the whole town
is looking at us right now,

08:13.460 --> 08:15.561
and you're
letting them down.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.429
Take an hour,
go clear your heads,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.349
and see if you can come up with
a real idea that we can use.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.900
And also see
if you're interested

08:21.968 --> 08:23.202
in contributing
to this department.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.804
And after that,
I will tell you my idea.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.477
Wow, you really
let 'em have it.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.578
Well, I had no choice.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.679
I didn't want to tell them
my idea.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.813
Why not?

08:35.881 --> 08:37.683
Because I don't have one.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.018
I don't have an idea, Ann.

08:41.451 --> 08:42.918
I'm so screwed, Ann.

08:43.001 --> 08:45.318
The meeting is tomorrow and
I don't have anything.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.818
Why don't you build the Park
on the lot behind my house?

08:48.004 --> 08:50.406
Chris wants the new project
to generate revenue.

08:50.457 --> 08:52.291
What about those binders
in your office?

08:52.375 --> 08:53.509
They're filled
with small ideas!

08:53.576 --> 08:55.160
We need a big, juicy idea.

08:55.245 --> 08:58.280
I'm so desperate, I even
brought in my "Dream Journal",

08:58.331 --> 09:00.332
hoping it would inspire me.

09:00.417 --> 09:03.452
"I married Alf,
and we're pretty happy."

09:03.520 --> 09:05.921
- Sounds nice.
- It was.

09:05.989 --> 09:07.056
Okay, listen to me.

09:07.123 --> 09:08.640
You are smart and creative

09:08.725 --> 09:10.642
and talented,
and you're gonna be fine.

09:10.727 --> 09:12.011
You're probably right.

09:12.095 --> 09:15.330
I just need an hour, and...
and it'll come to me.

09:20.036 --> 09:20.986
Hello?

09:21.071 --> 09:22.604
Andy, you have to save me.

09:22.672 --> 09:24.139
I'm camping with
people I work with.

09:24.207 --> 09:25.324
Hello, April?

09:25.392 --> 09:26.875
Hello?

09:26.943 --> 09:29.144
Walk around in circles,
like I am,

09:29.195 --> 09:32.047
help triangulate
the phone call.

09:32.115 --> 09:33.282
Hello?

09:35.118 --> 09:37.119
Hang on, I'm gonna try
to get to higher ground.

09:37.187 --> 09:38.454
Agh!

09:38.521 --> 09:40.122
Ow, I found some thorns.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.759
I mean, yes,
my daughter might think

09:43.826 --> 09:46.161
she is old enough to be sexually
active with her boyfriend.

09:46.212 --> 09:47.763
But I'm sorry, 16.

09:47.831 --> 09:50.065
That... that just seems too young
to be on birth control.

09:50.133 --> 09:52.501
You know, I was 24
when Gayle took my virginity.

09:52.569 --> 09:55.204
What's say we just
stand here

09:55.271 --> 09:57.072
in silence.

09:57.140 --> 09:59.475
And think of ideas...

09:59.542 --> 10:01.043
for projects.

10:01.111 --> 10:02.511
You know
what I should do?

10:02.579 --> 10:05.680
I should lead
a teen abstinence workshop.

10:08.017 --> 10:10.869
That might be
incredibly effective.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.132
Hey, Tom.

10:23.199 --> 10:26.502
One second, I'm just in
the middle of a head massage.

10:27.554 --> 10:28.537
That's a good stopping point.

10:28.605 --> 10:30.556
- What's up?
- Uh...

10:30.640 --> 10:32.374
You wanna bounce some ideas
off each other?

10:32.425 --> 10:33.675
Here's a better idea.

10:33.743 --> 10:35.144
How 'bout I bounce my way
over to my dog couch

10:35.211 --> 10:36.895
and watch a little season six
of <i>Top Chef?</i>

10:36.980 --> 10:39.348
- All right.
- I know Leslie seems upset.

10:39.399 --> 10:41.350
But the truth is, she's better
than us at this stuff

10:41.417 --> 10:42.751
by a thousand miles.

10:42.819 --> 10:43.735
So there's really no point.

10:43.820 --> 10:45.187
Care for some fondue?

10:45.238 --> 10:47.356
Yeah.

10:47.407 --> 10:49.741
Hey, how do you
afford all this stuff?

10:49.826 --> 10:51.410
I just return it
the next day

10:51.494 --> 10:52.694
and claim it was defective.

10:52.762 --> 10:53.912
The key is crying a lot.

10:53.997 --> 10:55.597
No one likes to hear
a grown man cry.

10:55.665 --> 10:57.116
And then my hand accidentally

10:57.200 --> 10:58.700
went in the panini press!

11:00.003 --> 11:01.420
Hey, you wanna
go for a walk?

11:01.504 --> 11:02.454
Yeah.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.842
Wow, the sky
is really beautiful.

11:06.910 --> 11:09.111
It's pollution from
the sweetums factory.

11:09.179 --> 11:10.112
It's gorgeous.

11:10.180 --> 11:12.214
But is it worth the asthma?

11:12.282 --> 11:13.916
No.

11:13.983 --> 11:15.584
Ben, this new project idea,

11:15.635 --> 11:16.919
it's not really a big deal.

11:16.986 --> 11:18.770
I'm probably making
too much out of it.

11:18.855 --> 11:20.556
No, no, no.
It's really big.

11:20.607 --> 11:22.124
I mean, you've got
everyone's attention

11:22.192 --> 11:23.225
with the Harvest Festival,

11:23.293 --> 11:24.560
and now you're gonna
seal the deal.

11:24.611 --> 11:26.111
It's the chance
you've been waiting for.

11:26.196 --> 11:28.763
Well, what if the festival
was, like, a high point for me,

11:28.815 --> 11:31.066
and I never do anything
better than that?

11:31.117 --> 11:33.569
Then you wouldn't be
Leslie Knope.

11:33.636 --> 11:36.505
So I have to keep thinking
about good ideas

11:36.573 --> 11:38.807
all the time,
or I'm no longer myself?

11:38.875 --> 11:40.042
No, no, no.
Not at all.

11:40.109 --> 11:42.211
I... I've just honestly
never met someone

11:42.278 --> 11:43.512
who works as hard
as you do.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.998
I mean, you're like
the energizer bunny

11:46.082 --> 11:48.750
of city government.

11:50.086 --> 11:53.522
And when she looked
in the back of her car,

11:53.590 --> 11:57.626
she saw that, even though
it was her own private property,

11:57.694 --> 12:01.196
she would be forced
to take it in...

12:01.264 --> 12:03.065
for a state inspection!

12:03.132 --> 12:04.399
Okay, guys, listen up.

12:05.568 --> 12:07.269
- What was that?
- That was me talking.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.637
No, I heard it too.

12:08.688 --> 12:09.655
Andy?

12:09.739 --> 12:10.989
If that's a coyote,

12:11.074 --> 12:12.774
someone needs to pick me up
off the ground, now.

12:12.825 --> 12:14.543
Oh, my God! Oh, oh!

12:14.611 --> 12:16.745
- Hey, guys.
- What are you doing here?

12:16.813 --> 12:18.163
I was just out
for my nighttime run,

12:18.248 --> 12:20.282
and I thought, "why not go
visit the Parks Department?"

12:20.350 --> 12:21.350
How's everything going here?

12:21.417 --> 12:23.619
Super great.
Really well.

12:23.670 --> 12:25.621
We have a great idea.

12:25.688 --> 12:26.988
Ooh, tell me now!

12:27.040 --> 12:28.323
While I sit on this Boulder.

12:28.374 --> 12:29.658
I'm much more receptive
to new ideas

12:29.709 --> 12:31.493
when my heart rate
is still elevated.

12:31.561 --> 12:34.796
Chris, do you want to maybe
just talk for a minute

12:34.864 --> 12:36.164
and let them work.

12:36.232 --> 12:38.350
Oh! Oh, sure.

12:45.174 --> 12:47.609
What was that?
What was that?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.698
Leslie, just tell us
your idea.

12:52.782 --> 12:56.902
<i>Los Angeles,</i> season one,
isn't gonna watch itself.

12:56.986 --> 12:58.587
Here it is.

13:02.859 --> 13:03.892
What do you think?

13:05.828 --> 13:07.429
I don't have an idea.
I'm sorry.

13:07.497 --> 13:09.598
I thought if we all
worked really hard,

13:09.666 --> 13:10.966
I-I could come up
with something.

13:11.034 --> 13:12.000
But I don't have anything,

13:12.068 --> 13:13.101
and we're totally screwed.

13:13.169 --> 13:15.037
And what we need to do

13:15.104 --> 13:18.206
is just keep working
and just work again, more,

13:18.258 --> 13:19.942
and just do it and get it,

13:20.009 --> 13:21.376
and then we got it
and we're good.

13:21.444 --> 13:24.746
And go with that.

13:24.814 --> 13:26.181
I think I'm gonna turn in.

13:26.249 --> 13:27.916
You're not going anywhere.
No one's going anywhere.

13:27.984 --> 13:28.984
No one's sleeping,

13:29.035 --> 13:30.168
because this
is an all-nighter.

13:30.253 --> 13:31.503
And that'll be fun.

13:31.587 --> 13:33.155
We'll all stay up,
and then I'll be like,

13:33.222 --> 13:34.322
"hey! No one sleep!"

13:36.009 --> 13:37.793
Do you hear how loud that is?

13:37.860 --> 13:39.394
You're not sleeping
through that.

13:39.462 --> 13:40.562
Is there anything else
to eat?

13:40.630 --> 13:41.964
The marshmallows
are all gone.

13:42.031 --> 13:43.849
We have nothing to eat.

13:43.933 --> 13:45.867
Jerry scared
all the fish away

13:45.935 --> 13:47.970
with his loud
personal stories.

13:48.021 --> 13:49.871
Uck, I wanna go home.

13:49.939 --> 13:51.006
I miss my canopy bed.

13:51.074 --> 13:53.508
Yeah, I'm fine
with not camping.

13:53.559 --> 13:56.745
Especially since my stupid
boyfriend abandoned me!

13:56.813 --> 13:58.580
I'll fire up the van.

14:00.650 --> 14:02.651
You know, I've never
moved this slowly before.

14:02.702 --> 14:05.704
It's almost like
being in quicksand.

14:05.788 --> 14:07.422
Hey, um, listen...

14:07.490 --> 14:08.540
When you dumped me,

14:08.624 --> 14:11.226
it was really embarrassing.

14:11.294 --> 14:13.428
You just kind of...
took off.

14:13.496 --> 14:14.896
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:14.964 --> 14:16.832
I mean, I never meant
to hurt you.

14:16.899 --> 14:20.068
And, well, um,
I'm back now.

14:20.136 --> 14:21.703
Hey, I have a great idea.

14:21.771 --> 14:23.805
Why don't we go to this
rustic Diner that I know?

14:23.873 --> 14:25.207
We can have
egg white omelets,

14:25.274 --> 14:27.259
and we can continue
to talk about us.

14:27.343 --> 14:28.977
Sounds good.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.014
No, no.

14:34.450 --> 14:36.268
Chocolate or butterscotch?

14:36.352 --> 14:38.353
Uh, swirl me.

14:38.421 --> 14:40.722
Dude, camping is awesome.

14:40.790 --> 14:41.790
I love it.

14:41.858 --> 14:43.725
Excuse me, gentlemen.

14:43.776 --> 14:46.161
How long have you been
running power to this tent?

14:46.229 --> 14:47.929
I don't know.
How long have we been here?

14:47.997 --> 14:49.965
Ten hours.

14:50.033 --> 14:52.934
No! I was Tivoing
<i>Cupcake Wars.</i>

14:53.002 --> 14:54.236
This is ridiculous!

14:54.287 --> 14:55.787
Look, I am used
to a certain level

14:55.872 --> 14:56.955
of comfort in my life,

14:57.040 --> 14:58.407
and I didn't want
to sacrifice that!

14:58.474 --> 14:59.975
Okay, well, I packed
everything up,

15:00.043 --> 15:01.993
so now you're telling me
I have to go unpack it.

15:02.078 --> 15:03.178
Guys, this is a sign.

15:03.246 --> 15:04.279
You wanted to leave,

15:04.347 --> 15:06.281
and now you're stuck here
with me!

15:06.332 --> 15:07.949
So we can work all night!

15:08.017 --> 15:09.835
This is gonna be
so much fun!

15:09.919 --> 15:11.086
All night work!

15:11.137 --> 15:12.287
All night work!

15:12.338 --> 15:13.488
All night work!

15:13.556 --> 15:14.789
You know what?

15:14.841 --> 15:16.191
There's a Bed & Breakfast
right up the road.

15:16.259 --> 15:17.292
I'm gonna head there.

15:17.343 --> 15:19.761
Yes! Let's keep
brainstorming.

15:19.812 --> 15:21.196
I have a good feeling
about this B&B.

15:21.264 --> 15:24.499
One day, there's gonna
be a plaque there that reads,

15:24.567 --> 15:26.134
"this is where Leslie Knope

15:26.202 --> 15:31.473
"came up with
the amazing idea for..."

15:31.524 --> 15:33.275
Damn, I thought
that would work.

15:34.624 --> 15:36.975
Welcome to
"The Quiet Corn".

15:37.000 --> 15:38.351
I'm Elsa Clack.

15:38.885 --> 15:41.253
Breakfast is served
between 5:30

15:41.321 --> 15:42.921
and 6:15 A.M.

15:43.489 --> 15:45.190
What if we sleep
to a normal hour?

15:45.458 --> 15:47.509
Well, that would be
very rude of you.

15:47.794 --> 15:50.145
May I take
your breakfast order?

15:50.230 --> 15:51.814
We have hardboiled eggs,

15:51.898 --> 15:57.603
homemade tomato slices
with dry seed and leek jam,

15:57.670 --> 16:00.322
and your choice
of german muffin.

16:02.409 --> 16:04.276
What the
Is a german muffin?

16:06.145 --> 16:08.981
Oh, good lord.

16:09.049 --> 16:10.582
I call the bed!

16:11.668 --> 16:12.651
Ah.

16:12.719 --> 16:13.752
Awesome.

16:13.820 --> 16:15.120
I hate this place.

16:15.171 --> 16:16.955
This place is the exact opposite
of <i>Skymall.</i>

16:17.006 --> 16:17.956
Oh, listen to this.

16:18.007 --> 16:19.658
"Dear Quiet Corn,

16:19.709 --> 16:21.860
"thank you for
your beautiful Inn.

16:21.928 --> 16:24.162
"My wife and I spent
three nights of ecstasy

16:24.214 --> 16:25.764
in this room."

16:25.832 --> 16:26.832
Ugh!

16:26.883 --> 16:27.883
Gyash!

16:29.135 --> 16:31.603
There are no TVs anywhere.

16:31.671 --> 16:34.022
This place is lamer
than outside.

16:34.107 --> 16:35.641
I'm chillin'.

16:35.692 --> 16:36.942
What is that?

16:37.009 --> 16:38.177
Jim.

16:38.244 --> 16:41.480
♪ Tou come sleepin'
in the tent ♪

16:41.548 --> 16:42.514

16:44.784 --> 16:47.035

16:52.041 --> 16:54.126

16:54.194 --> 16:55.861
where have you been?

16:55.929 --> 16:57.496
I told you I was gonna
take you campin', didn't I?

16:57.547 --> 16:58.797
Yeah.

16:58.865 --> 17:00.299
Well, I'm taking you campin'.
Look at this.

17:00.366 --> 17:01.867
This is what I had set up
at the other campsite.

17:01.918 --> 17:04.051
Except for it
was way nicer there.

17:04.137 --> 17:06.872
But this'll do.
I've got some champagne.

17:06.923 --> 17:10.209
And I had to drink
most of it to survive.

17:10.276 --> 17:13.011
So I'm kind of buzzed
right now.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.047
I'm just glad you're here.

17:15.115 --> 17:16.147
Can we make out now?

17:18.401 --> 17:20.486
No, you have to understand

17:20.553 --> 17:22.554
that at the time,
I genuinely thought

17:22.605 --> 17:24.723
that you and I would never
see each other again.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.608
I completely understand.

17:26.693 --> 17:28.160
Well, that's what
makes you so amazing.

17:28.228 --> 17:30.395
- No.
- Ann Perkins...

17:30.447 --> 17:31.447
Amazing.

17:34.617 --> 17:36.135
Oh, no.

17:36.202 --> 17:38.420
Oh, no?

17:38.505 --> 17:39.671
Oh, no.

17:39.739 --> 17:41.924
No, no, no.
I wasn't saying that...

17:42.008 --> 17:44.543
I thought we should
get back together again.

17:44.611 --> 17:46.078
But you said that...

17:46.146 --> 17:47.846
You indicated...

17:47.914 --> 17:50.432
Oh, my God,
this is happening again.

17:50.517 --> 17:52.518
I have to move, right?

17:52.585 --> 17:54.419
Yeah.

17:54.487 --> 17:55.687
I'm gonna leave the country.

17:55.755 --> 17:58.256
Bye, everybody.
Bye.

18:01.928 --> 18:03.595
Hey.

18:03.663 --> 18:04.930
Hey. Couldn't sleep?

18:04.998 --> 18:08.934
No. My room is filled
with cat hair and cat smell.

18:09.002 --> 18:11.703
And actual cats,
roughly 12 cats.

18:11.771 --> 18:12.938
Hmm, sounds delightful.

18:12.989 --> 18:14.439
Leslie, what are you doing?

18:14.507 --> 18:17.943
I am listening to
<i>Steal my Sunshine</i> by Len.

18:18.011 --> 18:20.579
A one-hit wonder, like me.

18:20.647 --> 18:21.780
You're not
a one-hit wonder.

18:21.848 --> 18:22.948
Well, I will be.

18:23.016 --> 18:24.650
I peaked at
the Harvest Festival, Ron.

18:24.717 --> 18:25.984
Years from now,
people are gonna say,

18:26.052 --> 18:27.252
"Remember that woman
who came up with

18:27.320 --> 18:28.720
"the Harvest Festival idea
and never came up

18:28.788 --> 18:29.922
"with another idea again?

18:29.989 --> 18:30.889
"What happened to her?
What was her name?

18:30.957 --> 18:32.090
"Kim? Anyway, who cares?

18:32.158 --> 18:33.725
"She's stupid,
and she's dead now."

18:33.793 --> 18:34.893
For the first time ever,

18:34.961 --> 18:36.328
the Parks Department
has real momentum,

18:36.396 --> 18:37.796
and I'm gonna ruin it
for everybody.

18:37.864 --> 18:39.898
You've done more
for this group of people

18:39.966 --> 18:41.466
than anyone else.

18:41.534 --> 18:44.102
You're the only reason we all
still have jobs.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.654
I think we'll be okay.

18:45.738 --> 18:47.305
Yeah, okay, well, I would
love to chit-chat about this,

18:47.357 --> 18:48.640
but I need
to keep working, okay?

18:48.691 --> 18:50.909
And keep pushing so that
my breakthrough will happen,

18:50.977 --> 18:53.412
and I will be ready for it.

18:53.479 --> 18:54.646
You know what?

18:54.697 --> 18:57.449
I just had an idea
for a new project.

18:57.517 --> 18:59.284
- Really?
- Yes.

18:59.335 --> 19:01.820
Yes, I think... I think
this could be really good.

19:01.888 --> 19:03.088
What is it?

19:03.156 --> 19:04.089
Come with me.

19:04.157 --> 19:05.757
Right through here.

19:05.825 --> 19:06.792
Wait, what's happening?

19:06.859 --> 19:08.760
Aah! Ron!

19:08.828 --> 19:10.529
Ron, what are you doing?

19:10.597 --> 19:11.880
This is my idea.

19:11.965 --> 19:14.299
You're gonna shut your brain
down and go to sleep,

19:14.367 --> 19:15.801
and I'm gonna stay out here
and guard the door

19:15.868 --> 19:17.869
- so you can't leave.
- No! Ron!

19:17.937 --> 19:19.171
You've been
thinking about work

19:19.239 --> 19:20.806
non-stop for years!

19:20.873 --> 19:22.007
It's time to rest!

19:22.075 --> 19:23.692
All my binders
are downstairs!

19:23.776 --> 19:24.843
Shh!

19:24.894 --> 19:26.245
All due respect,
Ms. Clack,

19:26.312 --> 19:27.679
stick a german muffin in it.

19:27.747 --> 19:29.781
Fair enough.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

19:29.849 --> 19:31.883
Just call it a night.

19:31.951 --> 19:33.352
I already checked, Leslie.

19:33.419 --> 19:34.953
The transom is painted shut.

19:35.021 --> 19:37.489
Damn it!

19:37.557 --> 19:40.192
Oh, my God, there's, like,
50 cats in here.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.665
Where's Leslie?

19:46.733 --> 19:48.333
Not 100% sure.

19:48.401 --> 19:49.885
Should we reschedule or...

19:49.969 --> 19:51.470
nope, she'll be here.

19:51.537 --> 19:52.471
Good morning!

19:52.538 --> 19:54.306
So I just slept seven hours,

19:54.374 --> 19:56.174
which is twice as long
as I usually sleep,

19:56.242 --> 19:57.643
so I'm a little disoriented.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.745
But I did wake up
with a million ideas,

19:59.812 --> 20:01.396
and Ron would not
let me have any paper,

20:01.481 --> 20:03.715
so I had to write them down
on this doily.

20:03.766 --> 20:06.151
We should buy a telescope
and make the old ranger station

20:06.218 --> 20:07.919
in Ramsett Park
an Observatory.

20:07.987 --> 20:09.021
That way,
we could sell tickets

20:09.088 --> 20:10.088
and have class trips.

20:10.156 --> 20:11.323
- I like it! We'll...
- Good!

20:11.390 --> 20:12.407
Then have theme night
at the Park.

20:12.492 --> 20:14.559
We could have singles,
um, date night,

20:14.627 --> 20:17.663
uh, seniors, and we could
have a citywide yard sale,

20:17.730 --> 20:19.998
which would be part auction,
part <i>Antiques Road Show.</i>

20:20.066 --> 20:21.233
And then we could have

20:21.301 --> 20:22.668
the professors from
the Community College

20:22.735 --> 20:24.069
come in and assign value
to the objects.

20:24.137 --> 20:25.704
And then we could split
the profits for the school.

20:25.772 --> 20:26.705
It'd be a lot of fun.

20:26.756 --> 20:27.706
I'll see you boys later.

20:27.774 --> 20:29.074
Bye, Ron!

20:29.142 --> 20:30.876
They say you're only as good
as your last idea.

20:30.943 --> 20:33.612
I say you're only as good
as the people you work with.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.547
Leslie Knope is back.

20:35.598 --> 20:36.715
Ha ha!

20:36.783 --> 20:39.017
Oh, my God,
my breath is so bad.
