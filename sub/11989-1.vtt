WEBVTT

00:28.080 --> 00:32.320
We all have dark places buried within.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.200
I know I found mine...

00:38.080 --> 00:40.440
in a war in Iraq.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.560
A place inside me I never knew I had.

00:50.520 --> 00:55.800
A place I was led to by my own obsession
with the world’s most feared terrorist...

00:58.600 --> 01:02.600
A man who would choose me
to be his messenger.

01:12.320 --> 01:16.480
It was 2003, and the Americans
were about to invade Iraq

01:16.560 --> 01:18.680
to oust the dictator, Saddam Hussein.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.840
I was a war correspondent
for Time magazine

01:22.920 --> 01:26.120
sent in to cover the conflict
from the north.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.360
I’m not sure I can ever tell you what
drove me to come to this crazy place,

01:30.440 --> 01:34.040
but I loved being a journalist,
hunting a story.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.080
- Here it comes.
- Where are we going to go?

01:37.160 --> 01:38.920
- To this bunker?
- Uh...

01:39.000 --> 01:40.320
Let’s do it quick, mate.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.040
I was a small-town boy from Australia.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.240
This was my chance to get out.

01:47.720 --> 01:53.240
I was in my 30s, young and dumb enough
that war had a false sense of adventure.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.360
I simply couldn’t have been happier.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.480
Fuck me.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.440
Shh!

02:00.520 --> 02:03.160
That one was close.

02:05.480 --> 02:08.880
- Next time, take cover when they fire.
- Yes.

02:09.560 --> 02:13.880
The forward scout has just told us
he believes another mortar is on its way.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.280
Where?

02:16.360 --> 02:19.560
This was the first day I’d held a camera...

02:21.360 --> 02:25.120
A small, beat-up Handycam
I’ve carried with me ever since.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.280
In the end, I shot hundreds of hours
of tape, capturing my war on film.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.160
And in those tapes I found this story

02:32.240 --> 02:35.000
that I guess I’m finally ready to share.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.400
Do you want to go forward with
this man on the nightly probe? Tom?

02:39.480 --> 02:43.920
Tell him it would make for
a great story, but I’d better not.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.960
Ask Mick if he will go.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.320
I tell him I’d think about going
with a man I trust,

02:49.400 --> 02:52.720
and I think I trust this man very much.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.920
The funny thing is, we sit here and take
the exact same risks as these guys.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.720
There’s nothing that separates us.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.520
We can be as far in as we like.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.800
We can be journalists.
We can be noncombatants.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.400
That matters nothing to these mortars.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.800
We’re fucking close.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.160
Saddam Hussein and his sons

03:29.240 --> 03:32.520
must leave Iraq within 48 hours.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.920
Their refusal to do so
will result in military conflict.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.920
For their own safety,
all foreign nationals,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.240
including journalists and inspectors,
should leave Iraq immediately.

03:43.320 --> 03:47.840
Well, right now
we’re in the back of a sheep truck...

03:48.920 --> 03:52.320
and we’re leaving
the border town of Chamchamal

03:52.400 --> 03:57.400
to drive two hours forward
to approach the Iraqi front line.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.840
We believe we’re maybe three, four days
away from the beginning of the war.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.240
So that we can try and get there
before anyone else.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.240
My fellow citizens,

04:11.320 --> 04:14.400
at this hour,
American and Coalition forces

04:14.480 --> 04:17.240
are in the early stages
of military operations

04:17.320 --> 04:19.800
to disarm Iraq, to free its people

04:19.880 --> 04:22.520
and to defend the world
from grave danger.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.120
We spent the night here
under the Iraqi guns.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.200
We received word that Bush
had addressed the nation

04:29.280 --> 04:31.400
and essentially declared war.

04:31.480 --> 04:36.200
The Iraqis are not entirely enamored
with Saddam’s secular regime.

04:36.280 --> 04:39.400
However, they support
his anti-American cause.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.360
I love America.

04:48.600 --> 04:54.000
All of a sudden, there
was a god-awful explosion just behind us

04:54.080 --> 04:56.720
in what should have been a safe area.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.280
I’m not sure
when things went wrong with me,

04:59.360 --> 05:01.840
but it must have started
on this quiet road.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.840
There’s a journalist who’s been killed
by a car bomb or a suicide bomber.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.720
Probably not a good idea to be here long.

05:10.760 --> 05:15.640
I spun around
and across a grassy field...

05:16.680 --> 05:21.120
I saw the fireball
and the smoke plume.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.720
Something inside me changed, seeing this.

05:23.800 --> 05:27.560
The brutality of it,
its cruel kind of violence.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.080
The memory of it
stowing away in my mind,

05:30.160 --> 05:35.200
coming with me as I collected
the dead man’s body and sent him home.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.480
And then I went south
to the Iraqi capital.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.400
My fellow Americans,

05:43.480 --> 05:46.240
major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
In the Battle of Iraq,

05:48.400 --> 05:51.720
the United States and our allies
have prevailed.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.240
When I first arrived in
Baghdad, it wasn’t yet a bad place to be.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.200
A city under American occupation,

06:03.280 --> 06:06.600
it still had hope
that now things would be better

06:06.680 --> 06:09.640
and the Iraqis would be able
to live their lives.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.680
I felt daunted, still a junior reporter.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.560
There were hundreds of other journalists
who had all been here longer.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.280
I was convinced I had arrived late,
already behind the curve.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.600
I was less afraid of a war zone

06:24.680 --> 06:27.640
than I was terrified
I’d make a fool of myself.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.200
But I was lucky to live here
in the Time magazine bureau

06:32.280 --> 06:36.280
with other writers and photographers,
like the great Yuri Kozyrev,

06:36.360 --> 06:38.440
who became my Russian brother.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.440
Hello.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.520
And our staff of Iraqis
who were more like family.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.720
At our head was Ali, a grumpy genius.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.520
There was Omar,
our conscientious office manager.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.360
- Hi, Mick.
- And Nathan, my young translator.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.640
CIA asked me
to get your photograph.

06:55.960 --> 06:59.640
It was our job
to try to understand what was going on

06:59.720 --> 07:03.280
beyond the press conferences
and sound bites.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.960
They were my eyes and ears,

07:05.040 --> 07:08.960
and we were a brotherhood pushing out
into the madness on our own.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.160
I didn’t have time to write my will.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.880
Oh, man. All the time you bring me
to some shit, you know?

07:19.240 --> 07:22.640
It didn’t take long
to realize that something was going wrong,

07:23.280 --> 07:27.160
that the facade of a successful Iraq
was already coming apart.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.800
People are getting hotter and angrier.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.760
An air of desperation.

07:31.840 --> 07:37.760
A remote-controlled
explosive set off while US troops passed.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.840
In this car, a teenage boy died,

07:40.920 --> 07:45.520
shot by a nervous American soldier
at a checkpoint near our house.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.840
His brother had been with him
in the car when he died.

07:48.920 --> 07:53.840
Tell those fucking Americans
my brother’s blood will not be in vain.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.840
I’m gonna do something big.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.120
They’ve taken my brother’s life!
They stole his life!

07:59.200 --> 08:02.160
You couldn’t help
but feel his sense of betrayal.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.760
And he wasn’t alone.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.320
Behind all the Iraqis’ anger,

08:05.400 --> 08:08.360
an armed resistance
against the Americans was rising.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.880
It was small at first...

08:10.360 --> 08:14.480
Hit-and-run insurgent attacks,
shootings and roadside bombs.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.160
But then an explosion
rocked our neighborhood,

08:19.240 --> 08:21.320
larger than anything before.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.960
Driving towards it,
I had no idea what it was

08:26.040 --> 08:28.280
until I saw this.

08:44.680 --> 08:49.800
- Is it a car bomb? What was it?
- Yeah, a car bomb. Jordanian embassy.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.480
MAN Don’t film! Don’t film!

08:53.920 --> 08:55.080
Michael Ware.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.200
Michael, I believe
something’s just occurred.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.600
Yeah, Steve.

08:58.680 --> 09:03.120
Um, a suicide bombing
has just taken place

09:03.200 --> 09:06.800
at the Jordanian embassy
here in Baghdad.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.960
At least one or two car bombs
were involved,

09:10.040 --> 09:15.760
and it has completely destroyed
the front of the Jordanian embassy.

09:15.840 --> 09:21.680
There are a large number of wounded
and a number of killed.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.120
The scene is one
of total chaos, Steve.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.720
What are you filming?
Why do you film the dead?

09:27.800 --> 09:30.120
They’re just removing another body now.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.400
So, people are very emotional.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.560
It was the first suicide bombing
ever in Baghdad...

09:50.640 --> 09:53.800
A violence worse than anything
that had come before.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.600
No one knew who had done it,
but it had only just begun.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.600
The bombing
of UN headquarters in Baghdad

10:12.680 --> 10:15.280
killed at least 20 people
and wounded 100 others.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.480
No one has claimed responsibility
for the attack.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.080
This is when I started obsessing.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.040
These attacks were so dark, so sinister.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.440
I was becoming possessed by the idea
of how someone could do these things,

10:29.520 --> 10:32.480
of the hideous resolve
they must have had in their heart.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.880
And they were out there somewhere,
lurking in the shadows.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.520
Already fear, like a virus,
was spreading.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.120
From town to town,
platoon to platoon.

10:52.160 --> 10:55.680
On a stretch of rural highway
known for roadside bombs,

10:55.760 --> 10:59.920
a kid in a clunker of a car
says he’s run out of fuel.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.920
It’s run out of gas.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.600
Hey, hey.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.880
- There’s no gas.
- No gas?

11:12.360 --> 11:15.240
- It’s a wire.
- A wire right there.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.960
- You see that wire?
- Blue wire.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.320
Behind that rock! Move!

11:20.400 --> 11:21.920
Get down, get down!

11:24.720 --> 11:27.520
Impossible to know
whether he’d planted that bomb

11:27.600 --> 11:30.720
or if his car had really broken down.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.640
In a war like this,
everyone was suspect,

11:33.720 --> 11:36.000
everyone as guilty
as they were innocent.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.600
Hey, keep your fucking head down!

11:39.600 --> 11:41.800
- No, no, mister.
- Fuck you.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.000
No, no. It’s not working.

11:56.560 --> 12:01.320
A car bomb in Baghdad
killed 10 people and wounded many more.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.440
The apparent target was a police station.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.880
The Americans’ grip kept slipping,

12:05.960 --> 12:08.560
fighting an enemy they couldn’t see.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.400
It was hard just looking on
from the sidelines.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.440
I felt somehow
there was more I should be doing,

12:14.520 --> 12:18.920
to know who those men were,
to understand why they were fighting.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.320
At least that’s what I told myself

12:21.400 --> 12:25.920
as I began crossing to the other side
to talk to the insurgents.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.880
It took months, turning to anyone
with cousins or old war buddies

12:29.960 --> 12:34.800
or friends who might know someone
who knew someone still carrying a gun.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.080
I was fumbling, but over time
it seemed to be working.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.240
Gaining trust after trust,
the guerrillas began to let me inside.

12:48.760 --> 12:53.040
This homemade tape they gave me
was proof I’d made contact.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.720
It’s probably the first
insurgent video of the war.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.760
The rocket-launcher group
remains behind the first hill.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.240
The mortar group remains behind
the second hill.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.280
You understand the plan, comrades?

13:04.360 --> 13:06.840
One, two, three...
Then the explosion.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.160
Now it begins.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.720
One, two, three.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.640
Hit it. Hit it.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.360
Come on!

13:21.080 --> 13:22.280
- Fouad?
- Hmm?

13:22.360 --> 13:24.600
- Is this video with sound?
- God willing.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.960
We advise every honorable Iraqi mujahid

13:28.040 --> 13:31.720
to defend their country and their honor.

13:31.800 --> 13:36.600
We don’t accept any forces,
whether Arab or Western,

13:36.680 --> 13:41.000
to conquer or rebuild Iraq.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.360
Depend on Allah, mujahideen.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.640
Allah!

13:50.600 --> 13:53.640
Sir, all the Americans
were attacked over there.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.840
What did you blow up?

13:55.920 --> 13:58.320
- The mother of all ammo depots.
- The armored vehicles?

13:58.400 --> 14:00.600
- The armored vehicles all around it.
- Well done.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.560
- I got it twice.
- Well done. Well done, lions.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.320
- Go with Allah on your side.
- God willing.

14:06.400 --> 14:10.160
I know these men
and feel bad about this tape,

14:10.240 --> 14:14.080
filmed just for me when I insisted
on proof they were really fighting.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.880
Soon, I wasn’t just watching their tapes.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.280
They began taking me to secret meetings
in the dead of night.

14:26.680 --> 14:31.360
That’s my breathing
as I’m doing the filming.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.160
It was frightening.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.880
I’d surrendered myself
to these guerrillas,

14:35.960 --> 14:39.480
men the Americans were hunting
and I had found,

14:39.560 --> 14:43.320
not knowing if they were friends
or if they were going to kill me.

14:45.160 --> 14:49.440
I guess I knew it was insane,
but I couldn’t help myself.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.240
This is a message from us.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.400
By Allah, by Allah, by Allah.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.720
They will not have a restful day

14:57.800 --> 15:02.240
while there is a single Arab, Muslim,
Iraqi breathing in the land of Iraq.

15:03.360 --> 15:07.160
I was brought to this barn,
blindfolded in the trunk of a car.

15:07.240 --> 15:14.040
We will not stop resisting
the occupation until our last martyr.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.040
Soon it wasn’t enough
just to meet them.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.840
They insisted on taking me and Yuri
on our first attack.

15:25.400 --> 15:30.000
We were on the outskirts of the heavily
protected US base at Baghdad Airport.

15:31.600 --> 15:36.400
There was a guilt in watching this happen
as they targeted the Americans.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.080
- Give me your scarf.
- In the name of God the Merciful, why?

15:41.160 --> 15:43.280
Because I don’t want my face filmed.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.160
All I could think about
was chopper pilots’ video screens,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.880
where they can see anything
in the dark.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.200
The insurgents saw my unease.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.960
“Don’t worry,” they told me.
“We do this all the time.”

15:55.040 --> 15:58.800
Prophet Mohammad, peace be upon Him,
said it’s jihad until doomsday.

15:58.880 --> 16:03.920
And we will wage jihad and wage jihad
until the Americans leave our homeland.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.200
Pull your hands. Go, Go!

16:12.280 --> 16:14.600
- What do I do?
- You pull it.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.360
Where’s the American plane?

16:21.960 --> 16:23.360
Aircraft.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.600
These men saw themselves as nationalists,

16:27.680 --> 16:30.120
fighting to rid their country
of an occupier.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.360
But for all the blood they’d spilled,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.680
they were not waging
a holy war of suicide bombings.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.440
That, they told me, was someone else.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.800
Someone who scared even them.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.000
A man called Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.440
Zarqawi, who lived only in secrets,

16:54.520 --> 16:56.200
in mystery,

16:56.280 --> 16:58.080
with so little known.

16:58.160 --> 17:02.200
He was a Jordanian,
a militant radicalized in a prison,

17:02.280 --> 17:04.960
had run a terror camp in Afghanistan

17:05.040 --> 17:07.720
and was now somewhere in Iraq,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.960
waiting to bring the country
to its knees.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.040
It had been almost a year for me here,

17:20.119 --> 17:23.400
and at our house we prepared
for Christmas vacations.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.760
Happy Christmas!

17:25.839 --> 17:26.960
One, two...

17:27.040 --> 17:29.520
One, two, three.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.480
Hey!

17:32.600 --> 17:35.320
But our family
was about to be torn apart.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.200
Omar adored his son, Qutab,
and I adored Omar.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.400
Soon, a few blocks
from where he’s standing,

17:45.480 --> 17:47.480
Omar will be gunned down.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.600
Merry Christmas, Abu Jack.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.200
Merry Christmas, Omar.
Abu Qutab.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.800
Abu Qutab.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.280
And for a moment,
the war lost its distance.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.920
It had found us.

18:07.760 --> 18:11.800
Omar’s death forced us to leave that house
where we’d been so happy

18:11.880 --> 18:14.640
to seek safety
in a well-guarded hotel.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.960
That’s where I was when Zarqawi
showed himself to the world.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.720
That’s him, they say,
reading from those pages.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.680
Beneath him is Nicholas Berg,

18:25.760 --> 18:28.720
a young American contractor
Zarqawi had kidnapped.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.680
My name is Nick Berg.
My father’s name is Michael.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.080
My mother’s name is Suzanne.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.480
I have a brother and sister,
David and Sara.

18:38.560 --> 18:43.200
I live in West Chester, Pennsylvania,
near Philadelphia.

18:43.680 --> 18:47.120
You will see nothing from us
except corpses

18:47.200 --> 18:49.840
and casket after casket

18:49.920 --> 18:52.120
slaughtered in this way.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.560
God is great!

19:03.000 --> 19:05.280
There is no justification

19:06.400 --> 19:11.040
for the brutal execution of Nicholas Berg.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.920
No justification whatsoever.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.960
That day, it felt the entire war stopped,

19:16.040 --> 19:18.800
the wind knocked out of it
by the horror.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.640
Zarqawi was escalating.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.920
Then late one night in our hotel,
it all became very personal.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.480
A Zarqawi contact knocked on my door,
a DVD in hand.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.840
“The Prince of Princes ordered me,”
he said.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.600
“Give this to the infidel.”

19:37.680 --> 19:41.840
From the beginning, Zarqawi had
been filming his masterpiece,

19:42.720 --> 19:45.240
something that would
change the war forever.

19:45.320 --> 19:49.880
And now that it was ready,
he’d given it to me.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.200
This is the first-ever film
of suicide bombings in Iraq

19:56.280 --> 19:58.280
and the kids who were doing it.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.520
This one reading his living will,

20:00.600 --> 20:03.280
saying his farewells
in a darkened ceremony

20:03.360 --> 20:05.800
before setting off
to an American checkpoint.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.880
A torrent of my longing

20:20.640 --> 20:25.440
I see you all leaving,
and you will not be returning

20:25.520 --> 20:27.400
In the name of God the Merciful.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.280
This is all it is. A button only.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.880
Don’t forget us in your prayers.
We shall be missing you.

20:48.360 --> 20:52.280
This Western journalist
views horrifying video

20:52.360 --> 20:56.360
sent to him by
an Islamic insurgent group in Iraq.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.040
Oh, my God! I’ve not seen this.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.920
Michael Ware, working for Time magazine,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.240
is walking a professional knife edge,

21:04.320 --> 21:08.000
an unlikely go-between
for anti-Western militants.

21:08.080 --> 21:12.600
Whether you think I’m fortunate
or whether you think I’m doomed,

21:13.880 --> 21:17.800
the point is, I’ve been given a window
into something that no one else has.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.920
What we see here

21:20.000 --> 21:24.160
is Zarqawi’s terrorist group’s attack
on an American convoy.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.480
A pre-positioned cameraman
knows where the bomb will go off.

21:27.560 --> 21:32.440
A suicide driver will intercept
this convoy and detonate that explosion.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.160
This is a very, very sophisticated part

21:44.240 --> 21:47.040
of Zarqawi’s information campaign,

21:47.120 --> 21:51.360
stamping him as the star
of the new global jihad.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.520
♪♪

21:54.600 --> 21:57.320
It’s just fascinating
to watch a face like that...

21:58.440 --> 22:02.320
and know that, in a day or two,
he’s dead.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.120
He knows this is coming
and he welcomes it.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.280
This is their power.
It’s what they often say to me.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.760
“Our great advantage over you,

22:10.840 --> 22:14.760
that you are afraid of death
and we are not.”

22:26.480 --> 22:29.480
I’d never know why he sent it to me.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.000
It had to have come
from being out there,

22:32.080 --> 22:35.000
the foreigner roaming
among the insurgents,

22:35.560 --> 22:38.960
from fighters I knew
who knew him or his men.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.720
It was too big to think about,

22:42.800 --> 22:45.040
paralyzing to contemplate,

22:45.120 --> 22:47.280
a man like that choosing me.

22:52.960 --> 22:57.120
I felt he’d made me complicit,
somehow, in his war.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.600
Now there could be no turning back.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.040
The Americans
were losing control of the war.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.920
First, some of the desert provinces went.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.720
Then it was the highways.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.520
Bullshit! Bullshit!

23:23.080 --> 23:24.520
It’s an ambush!

23:27.280 --> 23:30.880
Till finally the US
was losing Baghdad itself.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.840
In the heart of the capital,

23:34.920 --> 23:38.160
Haifa Street was a special
kind of hell to the Americans.

23:38.240 --> 23:41.400
Last night,
two more soldiers killed on patrol here,

23:41.480 --> 23:46.440
making this one of the deadliest 24 hours
since major combat was declared over.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.760
Soldiers dubbed
its corridors “Purple Heart Lane”

23:49.840 --> 23:52.000
and “RPG Alley,”

23:52.080 --> 23:55.120
a place where even children
fought against them.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.280
It’s where Yuri and I met this boy,

23:58.360 --> 24:01.480
his parents killed
in an air strike on Fallujah.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.040
He’d been taken in
by his insurgent uncle.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.520
Come on, Hammudi.
Come here.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.560
- God is great.
- God is great.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.920
Look this way. God is great.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.680
God is great.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.440
I knew Haifa Street well.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.120
Its insurgent commander was a friend,

24:38.200 --> 24:40.560
at least to the extent of his interests.

24:40.640 --> 24:44.320
And in war, that’s the best type
of friend you can hope for.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.480
Don’t show it.
They fucking shoot at cameras.

24:48.560 --> 24:51.120
He said take a picture.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.960
Haifa Street is blocked.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.960
- He said it’s closed.
- I don’t want my face on film.

24:58.040 --> 25:02.080
That’s him, my friend, who I can’t film
for fear he’d be identified.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.760
We are moving around Haifa Street,

25:04.840 --> 25:09.320
which is now controlled by
the Iraqi mujahideen, or holy warriors.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.080
This is the insurgents,

25:11.160 --> 25:14.200
the guerrillas who are fighting
against the American forces

25:14.280 --> 25:16.920
and the interim Iraqi government.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.280
- Is it a free-fire zone?
- It’s a forbidden area.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.720
A US unit has moved into the area.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.480
Armored Bradley Fighting Vehicles
have taken up positions.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.720
Normally, whenever American troops
come into this area,

25:34.680 --> 25:37.200
the insurgents attack.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.040
Stop.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.600
It is not my hand,
but the hand of God.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.800
Allahu akbar.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.160
- Allahu akbar.
- Again! Again!

25:49.240 --> 25:53.080
They were lobbing mortars
at a base a few hundred meters away.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.720
Allahu akbar.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.520
- Should I shoot it?
- Shoot.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.680
Remove it. Remove it.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.120
Let’s go!

26:12.200 --> 26:15.160
The area was a prize
in the midst of the city

26:15.240 --> 26:18.040
that Zarqawi wanted for himself.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.120
First, he sent his men
in ones and twos.

26:22.720 --> 26:26.040
Then twos became threes and fours.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.440
Soon, word came back.

26:31.200 --> 26:34.080
Zarqawi had taken over Haifa Street.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.880
- Allahu akbar!
- Allahu akbar!

26:40.640 --> 26:44.040
My friend, the insurgent commander,
had been overthrown

26:44.120 --> 26:48.360
and sent one of his men to bring me back
so I could see for myself.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.040
Zarqawi had seized
the equivalent of midtown Manhattan,

26:52.120 --> 26:54.040
right in the middle of Baghdad.

26:56.680 --> 27:00.200
Ahead, ahead, ahead. Go, go, go!

27:00.920 --> 27:02.800
- This?
- Where? Where?

27:03.880 --> 27:06.440
Zarqawi’s black flags line the streets,

27:06.520 --> 27:08.520
his fighters everywhere.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.600
Another one.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.160
They’ll shoot the car.
They’ll shoot and burn the car.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.480
- Really?
- I swear by God!

27:21.680 --> 27:24.280
We made one pass down the boulevard.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.960
Then another.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.680
Continue.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.520
Wait, wait, wait.
Many, many mujahideen here.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.440
Until we were spotted.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.120
One of Zarqawi’s men
stepping out from the curb,

27:37.200 --> 27:40.720
pulling the pin on a grenade,
stopping our car.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.440
That’s all the tape I have.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.680
From this point on,
it’s only jagged, brittle memory.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.840
A swarm of jihadis grabbed our car,
reaching in to grab me.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.240
Clawing, dragging me.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.440
They were going to cut my head off,

27:58.520 --> 28:01.800
like I’d seen them do
in so many videos...

28:01.880 --> 28:06.800
Grabbed by the hair from behind,
screaming as the sawing began,

28:06.880 --> 28:08.760
legs flailing.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.240
The images reeling through my mind.

28:12.760 --> 28:17.200
I stood beneath a banner,
beside a man with a knife, waiting.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.760
That’s when he spoke up,
my insurgent escort,

28:26.840 --> 28:29.640
the one my friend
had sent to bring me in.

28:29.720 --> 28:33.760
He threatened Zarqawi’s men
with a turf war if they killed me.

28:35.240 --> 28:39.320
I just wasn’t worth it.
Even Zarqawi’s men saw that.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.600
With gritted teeth,
they shoved me back into the car.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.560
It was over.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.200
But in a way, it would never be over.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.360
For the next three days,
I didn’t leave my bedroom.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.760
I wanted to be sick
whenever I was in a car.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.880
I still hate shaving
with blades near my face.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.920
I guess most people
would have left Iraq after that.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.560
I don’t know.
It’s a thought I never had.

29:23.240 --> 29:26.280
Maybe by then,
it was already too late for me...

29:26.360 --> 29:28.840
to let it all go.

29:28.920 --> 29:32.360
Now I craved, almost sickly,
to know more,

29:32.440 --> 29:36.440
to comprehend
the enormity of him... Zarqawi.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.160
If he was obscene,
my intrigue was becoming perverse.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.760
The dark idea of him
would not leave my mind.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.720
And Zarqawi was never far away.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Two car bombs.

29:51.080 --> 29:55.000
His suicide bombings kept coming,
even to our door.

29:55.080 --> 29:58.360
- He’s coming.
- If they’re coming, I wanna be ready.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.960
Mick, you cannot
go outside with a gun.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.240
I’m not going outside with a gun.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.480
Get back! You get back!

30:05.560 --> 30:07.720
Get back! Get back!

30:07.800 --> 30:11.080
I’m Australian.
I’m American. I’m American.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.640
I’m a journalist! I’m a...

30:14.480 --> 30:16.360
I live here!

30:17.520 --> 30:20.840
The Americans
pursued Zarqawi relentlessly,

30:20.920 --> 30:24.040
but still he was taking over the war.

30:27.080 --> 30:31.520
In Fallujah, a city west of Baghdad,
he now ruled.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.320
An insurgent stronghold,

30:33.400 --> 30:36.440
the Americans had no choice
but to take the city back,

30:37.160 --> 30:40.120
assembling a force
of 10,000 troops to do it.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.680
At last, Zarqawi’s men
were making a stand,

30:44.760 --> 30:48.400
daring to confront
the full might of the US military.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.680
And I wasn’t going to miss it.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.600
Eh?

30:56.160 --> 30:57.720
Fuck you.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.840
Didn’t you take a photo
of me sleeping?

31:01.920 --> 31:03.040
Yes.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.440
Fuck you.

31:21.800 --> 31:25.040
If Iraq is to be free
and a peaceful society,

31:25.120 --> 31:27.880
one part of the country
cannot remain under the rule

31:27.960 --> 31:29.840
of assassins and terrorists.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.960
We will hunt down the criminals.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.320
We will kill them or capture them.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.960
US commanders
made a somber prediction...

31:37.040 --> 31:39.800
The street fighting could be
the heaviest since Vietnam.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.800
Our purpose is to give back Fallujah
to the people of Iraq.

31:43.880 --> 31:48.480
We are to clear this city
of the terrorists and the criminals.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.880
There is nothing walking in that town
that I’m afraid of

31:52.760 --> 31:54.600
because I got you all with me.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.120
Whoa!

31:56.200 --> 31:58.920
You make contact,
I expect you to finish it.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.560
Finish it with the biggest weapon
you’ve got.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.880
Leaders have got to account
for your soldiers.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.080
Know where they’re at on the battlefield.
Support them.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.800
If they get in a catfight,

32:08.880 --> 32:12.480
I expect you guys to pile on
and kick somebody’s ass.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.960
I’m not afraid of anything in there.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.320
And neither should you be.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.080
You reach around,
you put your arms around each other,

32:20.160 --> 32:23.000
walk into this city together
and you walk out together.

32:23.840 --> 32:24.880
Whoa!

32:24.960 --> 32:26.360
Let’s pray.

32:27.720 --> 32:32.120
Heavenly Father, your word says
you do not give us a spirit of fear,

32:32.200 --> 32:34.480
but of courage and of sound mind.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.040
I ask you
to give these soldiers today

32:37.120 --> 32:40.760
that courage that they have to do
to accomplish this task.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.920
Protect each soldier
as they go into battlefields.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.800
Let us be able to take all back with us.
In your precious and holy name, amen.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.440
Hey, Fallujah’s that way, y’all.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.760
Hey, Jack. It’s your dad here, mate.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.680
Just about to go
into the battle of Fallujah.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.760
I love you, Son.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.960
We were
the first American unit into the city

33:14.040 --> 33:17.800
and were quickly surrounded
by Zarqawi’s suicidal fighters

33:17.880 --> 33:21.000
who had stayed behind
when everyone else had fled.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Hey, I’m hit!

33:29.640 --> 33:30.760
Hold on. Hold on.

33:30.840 --> 33:31.920
Nick?

33:34.880 --> 33:37.680
- Good. I’m good, man.
- You’re all set.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.800
It’s odd, the things I remember.

33:41.880 --> 33:45.400
The boys’ faces
and how old they made me feel.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.760
Where is it at?

33:46.840 --> 33:48.360
That their leader, Lieutenant Meeno,

33:48.440 --> 33:51.440
had worked in an office
till not so long ago.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.360
- There!
- Fuck!

33:54.440 --> 33:56.200
And that Staff Sergeant David Bellavia

33:56.280 --> 34:00.520
was about to celebrate his 29th birthday
in the midst of the battle.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.720
Of all places!

34:07.800 --> 34:10.280
- It’s a Purple Heart.
- It’s a purple dick!

34:10.360 --> 34:13.320
- It’s a purple penis!
- RPG fire or something.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.440
Where did that happen?

34:16.520 --> 34:20.440
Hey, Doc, he’s gonna walk off...
He’s gonna walk it off, right?

34:20.520 --> 34:22.560
Yeah, he’ll be all right.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.800
The other American units
were stalled entering the city.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.960
The further we fought,
the more we were on our own.

34:38.239 --> 34:40.880
So we’d have to go back onto the streets,

34:40.960 --> 34:44.800
through ghostly houses the soldiers
thought they’d already won,

34:44.880 --> 34:47.880
looking for fighters
hiding in the crevices.

34:52.520 --> 34:55.840
We have the good fortune
of doing our own BDA.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.840
Now we know we’re killing people.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.840
We know what they got. We can make sure
all those weapons systems get spiked.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.040
Okay, so that’s the plan.
We’re gonna leave shortly.

35:10.320 --> 35:14.080
We’re about to go into this compound.
There are six to eight dudes...

35:14.160 --> 35:16.160
- This one here?
- No, over here.

35:16.240 --> 35:19.160
They haven’t been able to find ’em.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.840
Before we roll in,
I’m gonna pound it with tank rounds.

35:22.920 --> 35:27.000
Just wait. Have your guys
in a cover position. Don’t be in the open.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.200
It was six of Zarqawi’s suicidal jihadis

35:30.280 --> 35:33.000
cornered in a block of empty houses.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.880
With night coming,
they had no way out.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.720
Once it hits that house,
we’re gonna be here.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.120
We’re gonna come out here
and we’re gonna assault this way.

35:42.200 --> 35:46.480
Push those fuckers this way so if he runs,
the tanks can direct him here.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.200
Let’s go!
Push through, first squad!

35:58.280 --> 36:00.360
First squad, get up here!

36:00.440 --> 36:02.880
Alpha team!
Alpha team, get up here! Alpha team!

36:05.080 --> 36:09.360
I want the last man in Bravo
in this spot when you assault.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.000
We’re okay here.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.520
- My bad, Bravo.
- First floor secure?

36:13.600 --> 36:15.160
First floor secure.

36:15.240 --> 36:20.280
Here we go, here we go.
Last man in Bravo, take that spot.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.840
- Bravo? Who is...
- Over here.

36:21.920 --> 36:26.200
From the first house,
we knew the jihadis were not far away.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.480
You gotta keep your weapon
up there. Stay up there.

36:29.560 --> 36:34.320
All right, Bravo. Split squad.
Go right, go left.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.200
Let’s go.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.000
We got a back door over here
that’s opened up.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.880
- It’s open.
- Blood on the basin.

36:44.760 --> 36:49.560
The search went on
for hours. House after house in the dark.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.920
Till we entered one last home.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.800
It was a trap.
Ambushed from six feet away.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.560
Bullets ripping through the walls.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.160
Hey! What the fuck!

37:17.240 --> 37:20.200
- I got shrapnel...
- I need a Bradley!

37:20.280 --> 37:22.800
- Have you been hit?
- Get me a Bradley!

37:22.880 --> 37:24.600
- Are you all right?
- I’m good.

37:24.680 --> 37:26.280
- Have you been hit?
- I’m good!

37:26.360 --> 37:27.480
Who is shooting?

37:27.560 --> 37:29.920
Zarqawi’s men had the advantage.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
We scrambled back onto the street.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.600
- Get back!
- I’m trying.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.520
There’s people in front of me!

37:35.600 --> 37:37.320
Get out of here.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.520
Yuri? Yuri!

37:39.600 --> 37:41.680
Yuri!

37:41.760 --> 37:43.400
Out of here! Go!

37:44.680 --> 37:47.600
We are not gonna fucking die!

37:47.680 --> 37:50.680
- Is anyone fucking hit?
- Nobody’s hit!

37:51.840 --> 37:56.200
Everything is fucking crazy.
We just got shot at at point-blank range.

37:56.280 --> 38:00.040
Someone had to go
back in there. Someone had to kill them.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.360
Yeah, I wanna go after ’em.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.880
- It was Staff Sergeant Bellavia.
- I wanna go.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.480
I wanna go.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.760
This guy is shooting
from point-blank range.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.760
- You wanna stay?
- I’ll stay here.

38:13.840 --> 38:18.080
- All right, let’s go get ’em.
- One sergeant followed. I went with them.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.640
You’re coming.
You’re fucking coming.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.760
Bellavia killed two in the hallway.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.360
- Who is that?
- Mick!

38:41.440 --> 38:44.840
- Who is it? Who?
- Mick! The journalist!

38:44.920 --> 38:47.200
Then he pushed further inside.

38:48.240 --> 38:51.240
I lost him, blinded without night vision

38:51.320 --> 38:54.640
and suddenly alone
in a house full of death.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.560
And then it went quiet.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.200
No gunfire, no Sergeant Bell.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.720
Something was wrong.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.040
I ran back to the others outside.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.880
Hey!

39:14.880 --> 39:17.120
- Who can hear me?
- Yeah!

39:17.200 --> 39:20.560
They need a couple more guys!
Sergeant Bell’s not answering!

39:22.640 --> 39:27.160
Pauly and someone else
are on the right side of the garage.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.800
Right side of the garage!

39:29.880 --> 39:33.480
And Sergeant Bella
and someone else went in.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.600
And we haven’t heard from them.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.160
Have you heard anything
from inside that house?

39:47.240 --> 39:49.920
- No.
- Man, it’s gone quiet.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.600
- That’s not good.
- I hope there’s no injuries.

39:53.680 --> 39:55.800
These were the longest of minutes.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.720
- I don’t know what’s going on.
- First ten. Then 20.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.560
Not knowing if Bellavia was alive.

40:01.640 --> 40:05.400
I couldn’t sit still.
I couldn’t just watch.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.080
He might need help.

40:08.040 --> 40:12.360
I ran back to the door of the house
to see if I could hear him.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.440
Then a sound came from inside.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.800
Someone’s calling out.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.360
- From where?
- Inside.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.280
- I can’t hear it.
- I can.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.880
Sergeant Bell?

40:28.520 --> 40:31.040
Sergeant Bell!

40:34.280 --> 40:38.320
He was alive.
On his own, he’d crept through the house,

40:38.400 --> 40:43.000
killing five of Zarqawi’s men,
some in hand-to-hand combat.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.560
- Hey, Bell.
- Yeah, hold on.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.160
Talk to six.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.640
- What’s he want?
- A report.

40:55.720 --> 40:59.200
I got three dead fuckers
who tried to shoot us at five meters!

40:59.280 --> 41:01.000
We were all stunned,

41:01.080 --> 41:04.880
but Bellavia, I think,
had found something in that house,

41:04.960 --> 41:06.840
a part of him he never knew.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.640
Fuck.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.280
That’s it. Moving out!

41:10.360 --> 41:13.040
- Hey, uh, suck up.
- Yeah.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.400
Me, I’d had no place going back in there,

41:23.480 --> 41:26.800
but I’d felt there was
nowhere else for me to be.

41:26.880 --> 41:31.720
And all I’d found inside was that
I no longer cared about dying.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.920
After six days of heavy fighting,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.560
US forces say tonight
they have taken the town of Fallujah.

41:46.120 --> 41:49.920
US and Iraqi forces
are now in control of 70% of Fallujah.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.280
A devastating
display of American firepower.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.720
The battle for Fallujah is all but over.

41:56.560 --> 41:59.560
It was a false sense of victory.

41:59.640 --> 42:03.680
For Zarqawi, the battle
had been a display of his power,

42:03.760 --> 42:08.720
his men willing to die in nothing more
than an act of glorious defiance.

42:08.800 --> 42:12.160
And their suicidal devotion to him
only grew stronger.

42:27.400 --> 42:30.880
By now, Zarqawi controlled
large chunks of the country

42:30.960 --> 42:33.000
and he was becoming more barbaric,

42:33.080 --> 42:36.480
bringing his vision
of an Islamic state to life.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.120
This is footage Zarqawi
never meant the world to see...

42:45.200 --> 42:49.920
These men posting notices announcing
the fate of a man held in their car.

42:50.840 --> 42:53.960
Accused of informing to the Americans,

42:54.040 --> 42:56.040
he’s been sentenced to death.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.720
God keep you safe.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.560
Allah give you victory.
Allah give us victory.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.400
Keep going.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.520
Move away, old man.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.240
Old man, give us space.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.080
Please, move on!

44:00.160 --> 44:02.480
God is great!

44:19.520 --> 44:23.200
Come, you can drive through.

44:23.280 --> 44:26.960
His methods
were horrifying, even to Al-Qaeda.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.680
Osama bin Laden’s deputy
wrote to Zarqawi,

44:31.760 --> 44:34.680
urging him to curb his violent excesses.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.680
Step back, step back.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.120
He ignored them.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.200
This film was retrieved
from the computer hard drive

44:45.280 --> 44:48.600
of one of Zarqawi’s
top military officials,

44:48.680 --> 44:53.080
videos brought to me by insurgents
I knew who’d drifted to Zarqawi

44:53.160 --> 44:56.600
but eventually chose to resign
from the terror network.

44:56.680 --> 45:01.840
Reporting one morning to their boss,
they blew his brains all over a wall.

45:01.920 --> 45:04.440
As they left, one turned and asked,

45:04.520 --> 45:07.560
“Do you think
Mick would want his computer?”

45:10.040 --> 45:13.120
Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.

45:13.200 --> 45:16.920
People, I am innocent!

45:17.000 --> 45:20.600
Men said to be thieves or looters
hung like piñatas.

45:24.880 --> 45:28.800
Zarqawi’s world
was one of unimaginable terror,

45:28.880 --> 45:32.120
everyone within it a prisoner
of his distorted reality.

45:37.200 --> 45:41.160
Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.

45:42.120 --> 45:44.560
There was only one place left to go...

45:44.640 --> 45:47.720
Into the very heart of Zarqawi’s power,

45:47.800 --> 45:52.600
to a province called Anbar
where he’d forged his Islamic state,

45:52.680 --> 45:58.040
to a city he’d made his dark capital,
a city called Ramadi.

45:58.120 --> 46:01.280
It was a forbidden place
to a foreigner like me.

46:01.360 --> 46:04.960
The only way in was to join
the American units stationed here,

46:05.040 --> 46:06.800
fighting for their lives

46:06.880 --> 46:10.000
in a hell their commanders
called “the meat grinder.”

46:10.080 --> 46:11.680
Fuck.

46:11.760 --> 46:13.400
So bad was the fighting,

46:13.480 --> 46:17.560
the Americans were struggling
just to keep this one solitary road open,

46:17.640 --> 46:20.640
a road dotted
with five lonely US outposts.

46:20.720 --> 46:24.360
It was the soldiers’ only lifeline
to the outside world.

46:28.040 --> 46:31.000
I’d heard there was
a group of marines under siege,

46:31.080 --> 46:33.560
ordered to hold the line,
whatever the cost,

46:33.640 --> 46:36.640
at a post known as the gov center.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.280
Hey, guys.

46:38.360 --> 46:43.120
Stay underneath the glass.
There’s snipers running around here.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.480
What’s this place like?

46:45.560 --> 46:46.920
It’s nice.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.360
Look out of the window.

46:52.640 --> 46:54.320
- You look out?
- Yeah.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.240
You see how it is, this place.

46:56.320 --> 46:59.200
Coming in! Coming in!

47:00.600 --> 47:04.760
Here, on their second tours,
Lance Corporal Jose Taseco...

47:04.840 --> 47:06.400
Fuck ’em up, partner!

47:06.480 --> 47:08.080
And Corporal Nathan Buck.

47:08.160 --> 47:11.520
Trying to get the go-ahead
to launch that 40 down there.

47:11.600 --> 47:15.840
When we got to Ramadi, the first day...
We had contact the first patrol we did.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.200
We were the first patrol out.

47:18.280 --> 47:21.600
So, it was just like, “What up?”
I couldn’t even believe it.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.400
Doc! Get in here, Doc.

47:30.400 --> 47:32.360
Watch my rifle.

47:32.440 --> 47:33.880
He’s hurt pretty bad.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.520
We lost three marines
and a corpsman.

47:36.600 --> 47:39.280
You just gotta keep your head up.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.440
Keep on pushing through, you know?

47:41.520 --> 47:45.640
You can’t let yourself get down,
’cause one person gets down and out of it,

47:45.720 --> 47:50.520
then it has a tendency to float
throughout the platoon and the company.

47:50.600 --> 47:53.120
So we... go out there and...

47:54.200 --> 47:57.840
do the good service
and do what we can to get back.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.880
Get their blood back too.

48:00.960 --> 48:04.640
No winners here,
just kids on an impossible mission,

48:04.720 --> 48:09.000
patrols sent out onto the streets
as little more than bait

48:09.080 --> 48:10.840
to lure out Zarqawi’s fighters.

48:14.640 --> 48:16.520
The Americans were outnumbered,

48:16.600 --> 48:20.080
with barely a third of the troops
they actually needed.

48:20.160 --> 48:23.440
- What do you see?
- It’s in that house. It’s in the house!

48:25.200 --> 48:27.520
Which house?

48:27.600 --> 48:28.920
Sniper AK on the roof!

48:29.000 --> 48:31.040
Which house?

48:32.080 --> 48:34.000
Hey, fucking check down there.

48:34.080 --> 48:36.320
Hey, just an old man.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.240
Direct straight. That house.
That two-story house.

48:43.840 --> 48:46.720
- Need you as a terp, sir.
- Right there on the wall.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.640
Is this ours or Zarqawi’s propaganda?

48:49.560 --> 48:51.760
Huh. Yo, there’s two.

48:54.120 --> 48:55.800
There’s two of them.

48:55.880 --> 48:59.320
I have this pharmacy.
This... This pharmacy.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.840
- This yours?
- No, no.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.840
This pharmacy.
I own this pharmacy.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.000
- He’s good.
- I am work this pharmacy.

49:06.080 --> 49:08.080
I don’t care where you work.

49:08.160 --> 49:12.000
I don’t know.

49:12.080 --> 49:15.400
It’s on your fucking store.
This is your shop, right?

49:15.480 --> 49:18.400
Mister, I am work this pharmacy.

49:18.480 --> 49:20.720
- This pharmacy, I am work this...
- You work here?

49:23.480 --> 49:26.160
Colonel Kelly,
do you know what direction that...

49:26.240 --> 49:28.080
Okay, so what do you...

49:28.160 --> 49:31.200
If you work in that pharmacy,
what are you doing here?

49:31.280 --> 49:34.760
- I am speaking with me...
- About that? How to blow up Humvees?

49:34.840 --> 49:38.200
No, no. No. I am work this pharmacy.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.600
Okay. Close your store up.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.120
Close your store.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.680
Close this store, close that store.

49:44.760 --> 49:46.520
Do you understand what I’m saying?

49:46.600 --> 49:48.120
- Close the pharmacy?
- Yes.

49:48.200 --> 49:50.200
And you close this one.

49:50.280 --> 49:53.120
If you get froggy, I will kill you.

49:53.200 --> 49:56.440
This guy, cuff him
after he closes his fucking door.

49:56.520 --> 49:59.200
Hey, we got movement back here.

49:59.280 --> 50:01.200
Hey. Fuckin’ face the building.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.800
Close your eyes.

50:10.960 --> 50:13.640
First team, we’re moving down.

50:18.760 --> 50:21.920
Give me your telephone,
telephone number.

50:22.960 --> 50:26.600
If I see “Ali Baba,”
I’ll call you.

50:26.680 --> 50:28.440
- You’ll call us?
- Call you.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.360
If you see Ali Baba?

50:30.440 --> 50:32.840
Hey, I’ll call you if I see Ali Baba.

50:32.920 --> 50:35.560
I’ll give you a ring.

50:37.480 --> 50:40.840
Go, go, go, go!

50:40.920 --> 50:43.520
Go, go, go!

50:48.680 --> 50:50.200
Freeze, motherfucker!

50:54.760 --> 50:57.120
Hurry up, hurry up! Hurry up!

50:57.200 --> 51:00.240
- Get in, get in. Let’s go.
- We got one here.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.440
Pick it up.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.760
- Pick up the fucking rocks.
- Pick up the fucking rocks.

51:05.840 --> 51:08.200
- Yes!
- Hey, get back.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.600
- Hey, do that...
- Watch your rooftop.

51:13.960 --> 51:15.600
Pick up the rocks!

51:17.720 --> 51:20.640
Let’s detain this fuckin’ asshole.

51:20.720 --> 51:22.320
Okay, sir.

51:24.320 --> 51:27.760
For marines, nothing
in this city is quite what it seems.

51:27.840 --> 51:32.000
A family man with a phone,
wires, rubber tubing...

51:32.080 --> 51:34.880
All possible bomb-making equipment.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.720
Gunshot residue on his hands.

51:36.800 --> 51:39.640
See how it turned that color?
With the specks?

51:39.720 --> 51:43.480
Guy’s fucking definitely been firing
a weapon in the last couple of hours.

51:43.560 --> 51:44.760
What’s going on?

51:44.840 --> 51:47.360
100 meters down,
there were two guys turkey-peeking.

51:47.440 --> 51:50.680
They did that two or three times.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.600
What kind of day is this?

51:58.680 --> 52:01.360
This is a fucking normal day in Ramadi.

52:06.200 --> 52:09.600
Back patrolling
with Corporals Buck and Taseco,

52:09.680 --> 52:13.000
we went to a rooftop to watch over
another American patrol.

52:13.080 --> 52:16.560
Keep your eyes open.
And try to stay low too, okay?

52:17.120 --> 52:20.720
You see anybody moving,
looking at us, you know what to do.

52:20.800 --> 52:22.720
There’s always someone
watching our position.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.600
Keep moving around. Don’t stay still.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.120
- Shit.
- Shit!

52:28.200 --> 52:30.760
Holy goddamn. Whew.

52:30.840 --> 52:33.280
- See where that came from?
- In front of me.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.800
Holy shit.

52:35.520 --> 52:38.360
- The motherfuckers are right here.
- They’re moving around us.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.760
Oh, shit. Buck, I saw movement.

52:40.840 --> 52:43.480
- Where at?
- There’s someone in that building.

52:43.560 --> 52:46.400
The fucking window with the gate.
Fifty meters away.

52:46.480 --> 52:48.120
Hold on one sec.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.560
There’s someone there.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.880
One, two, three.

52:52.960 --> 52:54.960
You son of a bitch!

53:03.560 --> 53:05.640
Whoo-hoo! Yeah, boy!

53:15.040 --> 53:17.640
- Fuck!
- Motherfuckers still out here, dude!

53:17.720 --> 53:20.120
My heart. Whew!

53:20.200 --> 53:23.000
We’re here way too fuckin’ long, man.

53:23.080 --> 53:25.280
We should’ve pissed fucking out of here.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.520
With Zarqawi’s men circling,

53:28.600 --> 53:30.680
it’s only 200 yards to home.

53:30.760 --> 53:32.520
Everyone, whoa! Hey!

53:33.800 --> 53:35.200
Will!

54:10.120 --> 54:13.280
Where the fuck this motherfucker at?

54:20.040 --> 54:22.720
Pick it up, Benny! Let’s go!

54:22.800 --> 54:25.560
- Let’s go! Let’s go!
- Come on, motherfuckers.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.040
Let’s go, dude.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.920
Come on in! Come on in!

54:41.000 --> 54:42.360
- Let’s go.
- Pick it up!

54:42.440 --> 54:44.240
Yes, I’m good. I’m moving.

54:44.320 --> 54:46.480
What the fuck?

54:46.560 --> 54:50.600
Leave my boy outside, huh, motherfucker?
Get up! Get up there!

54:50.680 --> 54:52.600
What the fuck, man?

54:53.760 --> 54:58.920
For an hour and a half today,
Sunni rebels went at two military outposts

54:59.000 --> 55:01.960
in the town of Ramadi
with everything they had.

55:02.040 --> 55:05.000
Militants
trade fire on Ramadi’s main streets,

55:05.080 --> 55:07.120
clashes that grow deadlier by the day.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.640
Every time these marines leave base,

55:09.720 --> 55:12.200
there’s every chance
they won’t make it back.

55:17.600 --> 55:19.320
Allahu akbar!

55:21.200 --> 55:23.960
Zarqawi wanted the Americans gone.

55:24.040 --> 55:26.680
To him, their very presence was an insult.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.240
This dump truck,
packed with explosives,

55:29.320 --> 55:32.480
heads for a US outpost called OP Hotel.

55:32.560 --> 55:36.560
♪♪

56:13.120 --> 56:18.360
Soon as we got hit, the one NCO left
started re-emplacing weapon systems.

56:18.440 --> 56:22.840
Weapons were blown across the building.
All these guys were buried.

56:22.920 --> 56:24.800
First, he re-established security.

56:24.880 --> 56:28.520
Second thing was start pulling our guys
to a casualty collection point.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.280
Our medic took over with the casualties.

56:30.360 --> 56:34.000
He took over with the re-consolidation
of ammo and sectors of fire.

56:34.760 --> 56:36.680
Was able to defend that position.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.600
There was a follow-on wave
that was supposed to hit us,

56:40.680 --> 56:42.320
try to overrun us.

56:44.280 --> 56:47.760
Guys got back in their positions,
kept firing and maintained...

56:49.160 --> 56:51.760
They’d been bombed
within weeks of arriving,

56:51.840 --> 56:55.760
Second Lieutenant Joe Walker
and the 30-odd men he commands.

56:55.840 --> 56:59.320
Not a single day had passed since
without them being attacked.

56:59.400 --> 57:01.800
- Are you a West Pointer, sir?
- No.

57:01.880 --> 57:05.400
I went to a small private college
in South Carolina called Wofford College.

57:05.480 --> 57:07.240
- Uh-huh.
- And, um...

57:08.520 --> 57:11.840
decided this is what I wanted to do
after September 11.

57:11.920 --> 57:15.040
It’s been full steam ahead ever since.

57:16.200 --> 57:19.200
Southern-looking observation position.

57:19.280 --> 57:22.840
Most of the contact down to the south
comes from small arms

57:22.920 --> 57:27.400
or people observing the hotel
with binoculars, filming us.

57:27.480 --> 57:30.560
That’s... That’s considered
engagement criteria.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.360
I like this bunker.

57:34.440 --> 57:37.200
- Think we could make a reservation?
- Oh, yeah.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.960
And let’s buy some property in Ramadi.

57:42.040 --> 57:46.560
Now’s the time to get in,
while the market’s sort of in a slump.

57:46.640 --> 57:49.160
Then when the boom comes,
we make a killing.

57:49.240 --> 57:50.840
Yep.

57:50.920 --> 57:55.240
- Let’s be serious then.
- Yeah, this is a serious situation, Yuri.

57:55.320 --> 57:57.240
This is no time for levity.

57:57.320 --> 57:58.640
Fuck off.

57:58.720 --> 58:03.000
What I’m about to show you is one of
our additions since we were attacked.

58:03.080 --> 58:06.040
We brought our snipers,
the battalion snipers in,

58:06.120 --> 58:08.480
to occupy a position on top of the hotel

58:08.560 --> 58:11.960
which allows them 360-degree overwatch

58:12.040 --> 58:14.280
out to 2,000 meters.

58:14.360 --> 58:18.840
They have a couple of confirmed kills
up here ranging out to 1,400 meters.

58:18.920 --> 58:20.840
So they’re pretty impressive.

58:20.920 --> 58:22.920
Been a good tool for us.

58:26.200 --> 58:27.800
Yep.

58:30.560 --> 58:32.360
- Fellas.
- Sir.

58:33.800 --> 58:36.880
We get RPG’s fired at us
every other day.

58:36.960 --> 58:41.520
Sniper rounds. We’ll take single rounds
from 360 degrees.

58:42.520 --> 58:45.480
It is a drive-you-crazy waiting game.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.600
When are they gonna hit us next?

58:49.920 --> 58:51.560
It’ll wear on you.

58:53.280 --> 58:58.160
Nowhere in Iraq was the
war as bloody for the Americans as here.

59:00.720 --> 59:02.480
In this platoon, since July,

59:02.560 --> 59:06.280
we’ve had eight WIA, six KIA.

59:14.080 --> 59:17.480
All of my squad leaders
and section leaders have been wounded.

59:17.560 --> 59:21.200
For a while, our company
was fighting at less than 70%.

59:21.920 --> 59:26.160
When you’re in a static defense,
you’re sitting around waiting to get hit.

59:31.800 --> 59:33.960
Guns are clean. Guns are reloaded.

59:34.040 --> 59:36.440
It’s just a day-to-day struggle.

59:36.520 --> 59:39.920
Everybody goes into survival mode.
Everybody just wants to get home.

59:53.120 --> 59:55.040
I seen things that’ll blow your mind.

59:55.120 --> 59:58.800
It’ll be an all-out contact, and there’ll
be kids playing soccer right there.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.080
Here comes more people
round the corner.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.200
- Same guy?
- A kid and a lady.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.920
- A kid, a lady...
- Same guy and another guy.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.120
This woman and child
are used as human shields

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.280
to move Zarqawi’s fighters into position.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.840
Send your warning shot.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.160
- Is he inside the building?
- Warning shots.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.120
We got it.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.000
- Imshi!
- Warning shot.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.280
Warning shot.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.680
They’re bouncing right beside.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.520
Imshi!

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.760
Dumb-asses!

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.000
- Is that another one right there?
- Where?

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.680
- No...
- Yeah, it is.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.120
Warning shots.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.840
He’s moving now.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.280
- There you go. S-AK. S-AK.
- Watch out. Get down.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.440
AK fire from north of Saddam Mosque.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.440
AK fire from north
of Saddam Mosque.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.920
Did you say dump trucks?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.240
- Dump trucks on “Y” Road.
- Am I engaging?

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.360
Take them down. Engage.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.760
Do not even let them come close.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.320
There’s someone firing out there now.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.160
- They’re shooting at something.
- Can you see anything?

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.760
You have a target. Engage.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.160
Suppress, suppress.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.240
- Shoot y’all motherfuckers!
- Suppress! Suppress!

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.480
Return fire. Suppress. Look out.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.080
Fire!

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.800
Everybody calm down
and give me a direction of where they are.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.440
Roger. You have five men...

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.680
Be advised.
Dump trucks moving south on Apple.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.160
They’re trying to get here.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.400
See any vehicle, kill it.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.080
Smoke from the northeast.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.240
All five US bases
in the city were being hit at once,

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.360
Zarqawi’s men lashing out
in a massive coordinated assault.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.920
Fuck!

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.960
Watch yourself! Watch yourself!

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.880
By nightfall it was over.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.720
The Americans
had beaten back the attack.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.040
But still, the threat remained.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.560
Zarqawi’s men would come again.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.880
Soon.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.400
I try to remember the big picture,

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.720
but when I got guys
gettin’ shot and gettin’ killed,

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.680
you get tunnel vision
and you hate this place.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.040
You start hatin’ everybody here.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.120
I could see
good men here losing their grip,

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.080
losing themselves.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.280
Zarqawi was now as wanted a man
as Osama bin Laden,

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.600
the Americans putting
a $25 million bounty on his head.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.480
And still he waged his war,

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.280
destroying one of the holiest of mosques,

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.400
inciting a savage civil war
he’d planned all along,

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.840
turning Iraqis on each other
in a bloodletting

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.920
the likes of which the country
had never seen.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.160
It was to be his greatest legacy.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.760
After years of pursuit,
the Americans finally found Zarqawi

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.280
where he slept at night,
in a small farmhouse north of Baghdad.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.600
Acting on a last-minute
piece of intelligence,

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.400
two F-16’s were scrambled,

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.640
dropping one 500-pound bomb.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.880
Then another.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.000
The most wanted man in Iraq is dead.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.000
Terror leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
is taken out...

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.920
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has been killed.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.320
Now Zarqawi has met his end.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.640
This violent man will never murder again.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.760
On the streets, jubilation.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.400
He’s called Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
the slaughtering sheikh.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.240
Well, no more.
Tonight he is a dead man.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.040
Baghdad police were ecstatic, singing,

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.960
“Zarqawi, where are you today?
Zarqawi, where’s the terrorist now?”

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.400
You can only be so hunted for so long.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.440
But I guess I knew it wasn’t really over.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.280
Zarqawi’s men kept fighting,
and so his holy war raged on,

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.360
the idea he’d unleashed
too powerful to have died with him.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.240
Allahu akbar.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.920
Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar!

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.000
“Certain dark chambers
of the heart, once opened,

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.560
can never be closed again.”

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.040
Or so a soldier wrote after serving here.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.840
I know this is what Zarqawi
had done to so many of us,

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.960
to the Americans, to the Iraqis,

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.880
to me...

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.680
Showed us recesses in our souls
we never knew we had.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.320
I found my darkest place here,

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.080
on a US patrol to sweep
a suspected terrorist village.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.320
A shot rings out.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.320
Soldiers on the rooftop had seen
a man running past us with a gun.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.000
Where’s he at, brother?
Where’s he at?

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.240
Who took that shot?

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.240
He’s gone that way, but he’s still here.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.960
Right here! He’s right here!

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.320
- Back up. Back up.
- Rod, get over here.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.480
Tell him to show us his hands.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.840
Tell him he’ll get shot again
if he doesn’t show his hands.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.520
Tell this dude to show us his hands,
or he’s gonna get shot.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.640
Hey, people, back up.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.920
- Hey!
- Get away from him. Good job.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.440
Hands!

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.680
Where’s the fucking weapon?

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.200
Push back a little bit.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.920
- Push back a little bit.
- Okay.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.240
Hey, set up over there.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.600
He’s in the process of dying, dude.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.160
Hey.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.000
Yeah, he’s fuckin’...
He’s dying right here, man.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.640
Hey.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.480
- There’s the weapon.
- Where’s the weapon?

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.760
- Right there behind his head.
- Okay.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.640
Drag him into the fuckin’ courtyard.
Go. Let’s go.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.720
- Roger that.
- Kibble. Grab him. Drag him. Go.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.360
What’s up, kid? How you doin’?

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.640
- Not so good, huh?
- Yeah.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.360
- You got him. You got him.
- Fucked up, bro.

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:33.160
What’s that thing?

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.399
- There’s a gun over there.
- We got it.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.160
All right.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.840
Hey, did you see where
this motherfucker popped out of?

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.120
- East of route line, correct?
- Fifty meters east of route line.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.399
- How is he doing?
- Tell them he’s dying.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.720
Hey.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.640
Get people on the roof.
Lot of you should be in the courtyard.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.840
We don’t have a good roof here, man.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.920
- Yeah, there’s no...
- There’s no roof here.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.279
We got a flat roof.

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:14.399
Gentlemen, establish security.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.800
He works for Al-Qaeda, sir.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.680
Warning, warning.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.359
I got two more right here.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:43.279
Hey, you’re about to die, dude.
That was a good idea, huh?

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.680
- Where was he shot?
- I don’t fucking know.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.279
The head, probably under the fucking arm.

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:54.279
- Yeah, ’cause it’s coming down.
- You want me to look?

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.720
- No, it’s...
- You okay?

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.800
- Doesn’t matter, man.
- Give him fuckin’ minimal aid.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.200
Give him fuckin’ aid, but fuckin’...

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.280
I ain’t telling you
to fuckin’ perform surgery.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.440
- Fuck!
- All right, come here.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.960
Let’s talk to his fucking family.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.080
Why don’t you just fuckin’ die.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.480
Hey, Doc’s coming here. Doc’s got it.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.720
- Watch out.
- I don’t wanna fuckin’...

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.160
This fuck.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.520
I ain’t telling you to fix him,
but you need to look at him.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.680
Take a quick look, Doc.
Not gonna help. He’s fuckin’ worthless.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.320
He just died. Stopped breathing.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.400
- He just stopped breathing?
- Yeah.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.480
Yeah, he’s done.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.200
Any ID on the guy?

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.760
- No. All he had was two mags.
- Double-checked his fuckin’ pockets?

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.320
I just checked ’em.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.120
Anybody got blankets?

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.840
Get a sheet or something.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.120
You got ID there, bro?

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.720
Oh, you do have ID of some sort.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.400
Hey, keep watching outside there, bro.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.120
That’s just called shock, yo.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.880
Here you go. Good job.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.320
He dead yet?

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.440
He still twitching?

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.720
Yeah. He stopped for a long time.
Thought he was dead.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.600
He have a pulse?

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.000
You can see his skull and his brains.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.680
Unless you want to do a CASEVAC?

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.240
No. The motherfucker’s dead.

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:16.760
Through his gasping,
it was my silence I could hear.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.600
All I had to do
was say something, anything,

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.920
simply clear my throat,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.800
to force the soldiers to give him
the medical aid they were meant to.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.760
But I didn’t. I just let it happen.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.840
No, that’s just twitching and spasming.
He doesn’t have a pulse.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.160
- He’s alive-ish.
- No.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.720
Maybe I was just too twisted up inside,
the soldiers too,

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.120
the brutality of it all having slowly
shaved away at our souls.

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.320
But I fear it might be more than that.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:55.360
They say, “Only the dead
have seen the end of war.”

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.680
Does that mean it lives in all of us,
waiting to be found?

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.600
In the end,
I spent almost seven years in Iraq.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.880
But I did make it home,
never to go to war again.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.320
It took time,

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.120
but somehow I learned to reconcile
with myself the things I’d seen...

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.000
The final attack has begun.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.560
The things I’d done.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.840
But I will always know
that at some unknown place,

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.880
at some forgotten hour,

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.360
I became a man I never thought I’d be.
