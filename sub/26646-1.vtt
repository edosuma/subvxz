02:36.614 --> 02:37.699
<i>Dear Mr. Core,</i>

02:40.451 --> 02:41.452
<i>three days ago</i>

02:41.536 --> 02:44.122
<i>my son Bailey was taken by wolves.</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:49.711
<i>This happened twice already here.</i>

02:50.753 --> 02:53.047
<i>No one in the village will hunt them,</i>

02:53.298 --> 02:54.883
<i>and I am alone here now.</i>

02:57.051 --> 02:58.469
<i>I have read your book.</i>

02:59.804 --> 03:01.973
<i>I know you have done this before.</i>

03:03.766 --> 03:04.767
<i>In my heart...</i>

03:05.852 --> 03:08.354
<i>I know that you are able to do it now.</i>

03:10.398 --> 03:12.984
<i>I do not expect you to find my son alive,</i>

03:14.235 --> 03:16.779
<i>but you could find the wolf who took him.</i>

03:18.865 --> 03:20.783
<i>Come and kill it to help me.</i>

03:23.036 --> 03:25.872
<i>I know you have sympathy for this animal.</i>

03:28.166 --> 03:29.250
<i>Please don't.</i>

03:31.961 --> 03:34.589
<i>My husband will come home</i>
<i>from the war soon.</i>

03:36.007 --> 03:38.134
<i>I must have something to show him.</i>

03:39.844 --> 03:41.262
<i>Sincerely yours,</i>

03:42.472 --> 03:43.681
<i>Medora Slone.</i>

06:12.830 --> 06:13.664
Oh. You're old.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.183
Thank you.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.644
I didn't think you'd really come.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.398
When I wrote to you I was...

06:38.856 --> 06:40.817
I guess I was gonna try anything.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.363
I'm very sorry about your boy, Mrs. Slone.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.199
So, you've come to kill it?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.744
To kill the one that took him.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.455
I came to help if I can.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.793
To explain this, if I can.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.796
You've hunted and killed one before.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.214
That's what you wrote.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.471
I would've killed the thing myself
if I could've found it.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.433
I tried to find it.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.521
That pack could be 8 or 10 members.
You don't want to find that.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.985
Can I ask you a personal question?

07:26.821 --> 07:28.030
Do you have a child?

07:31.534 --> 07:32.535
Yes.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.162
A daughter.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.708
She's teaching at a university
down in Anchorage.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.918
She wanted to be in Alaska.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.923
That city is not Alaska.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.689
Do you have any idea...

08:03.733 --> 08:05.860
what's outside those windows?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.034
How black it gets?

08:14.952 --> 08:16.579
How it gets in you?

08:19.290 --> 08:22.126
Your husband... He was notified?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.674
The men were supposed to contact him.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.596
I said I'd call, but I didn't.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.682
I can't.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.311
Not while he's there.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.525
Well, you're not alone.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.366
I'll show you where
the children were taken.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.410
Are those your only boots?

08:56.661 --> 08:58.120
Yeah. That's all I have.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.790
You're gonna need better boots.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.795
You met your husband in the village?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.547
I didn't meet him anywhere.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.590
I knew him my whole life.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.759
I don't have a memory he isn't in.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.178
And he left me here.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.264
With a sick child.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.015
Without a war.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.852
Someone on the radio said
it's not a real war.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.980
No, it's real enough. People are dying.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.191
He said he'd never leave me.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.820
Words can't be worthless like that.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.908
That's where the first boy was taken.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.829
After that, they had men
with riflesÂ on the high points,

09:39.912 --> 09:41.956
and they'd walk the children to school.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.002
Didn't matter for Bailey.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.133
The second was a girl, here.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.301
Cheeon's daughter.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.928
She was sledding
and the wolf came up behind her.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.930
From the north again.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.642
Does Cheeon live nearby?

10:02.518 --> 10:03.477
Yes.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.771
My husband's friend.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.649
Do you suppose I could speak with him?

10:09.942 --> 10:10.776
No.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.820
I don't suppose you could.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.493
What did it feel like
to shoot that female wolf?

10:24.248 --> 10:25.291
It felt awful.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.126
But...

10:28.961 --> 10:30.338
I really had no choice.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.509
Even though she'd taken a child, too?

10:40.306 --> 10:42.642
Because you think it's the natural order?

10:43.184 --> 10:45.853
The natural order doesn't warrant revenge.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.485
They're not what you think, Mrs. Slone.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.446
What happened here is... is very rare.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.618
What happened here...

11:01.160 --> 11:02.495
happened to me.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.095
But you were happy here once?

11:19.595 --> 11:22.056
That's not a question we ask ourselves.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.266
I've seen pictures.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.352
Girls in magazines,

11:26.852 --> 11:29.689
bathing suits and sand.
Seemed strange to me.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.819
There's a hot springs not so far.
A few hours walking.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.780
That's as close as I can get to warmth.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.534
A hot springs sounds good right now.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.994
It's a good place to get clean.

12:00.970 --> 12:01.804
Thanks.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.155
I had quit when Amy was born.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.789
Will she be expecting you soon?

12:30.124 --> 12:32.084
I don't know what she expects of me.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.630
It's been some time since we spoke.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.383
And your wife?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.218
She's...

12:43.220 --> 12:44.930
She's alright without me.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.438
I can't pay you anything.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.649
Chocolate'll do just fine.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.572
Money's not important.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.120
Goodnight, Mr. Core.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.669
Goodnight, Mrs. Slone.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.617
Is he up there? Is he down there?

13:50.955 --> 13:51.956
Is he up there?

13:53.457 --> 13:54.542
Is he down there?

13:56.377 --> 13:58.087
Is he up there? Is he down there?

13:58.754 --> 13:59.713
Goddamn demon.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.757
Goddamn murderer.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.843
It's how they are.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.638
Who are those we cannot see?

14:07.721 --> 14:09.139
If he's up there at least...

14:10.432 --> 14:11.517
maybe at peace.

14:11.809 --> 14:12.643
Is he up there?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.354
Or is he down there?

14:19.567 --> 14:20.609
Is he down there?

14:23.612 --> 14:24.822
Is he up there?

14:26.615 --> 14:27.449
No. No.

19:06.436 --> 19:07.646
<i>Black 3 down...</i>

19:18.991 --> 19:20.367
<i>We have contact...</i>

19:32.421 --> 19:33.380
<i>Stand by...</i>

19:44.057 --> 19:45.642
You're a fucking meat eater, Slone.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.414
<i>Negative, two-four...</i>

20:09.082 --> 20:11.460
<i>Might wanna send some engineers</i>
<i>to clear the road...</i>

20:12.252 --> 20:13.754
<i>Copy that. They're on the way.</i>

21:38.005 --> 21:39.298
You shut your fucking mouth.

21:47.597 --> 21:48.432
No.

23:54.975 --> 23:58.395
Ain't nothing, but a hickey, Slone.
You're one lucky son of a bitch.

23:59.813 --> 24:00.647
Bailey...

24:00.897 --> 24:03.358
You're gonna see him soon, buddy.
You're going home.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.333
Find it.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.210
Kill it.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.374
Come to get a wolf's tooth?

25:45.377 --> 25:47.003
You're going the wrong way.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.049
That girl knows evil.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.843
She'll tell you.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.932
What that girl knows is grief. You have a good day, ma'am.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.523
Go back the way you came.

33:47.900 --> 33:48.735
Mrs. Slone?

33:56.492 --> 33:57.326
Mrs. Slone? Help!

35:47.562 --> 35:48.729
Help!

35:52.066 --> 35:53.734
Help. Help.

35:55.027 --> 35:55.862
The boy!

35:56.904 --> 35:57.947
The Slone boy.

36:00.408 --> 36:01.242
Bailey Slone.

36:02.034 --> 36:02.910
Bailey Slone.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.163
The boy!

36:05.997 --> 36:06.831
The boy! You...

36:21.596 --> 36:22.471
You knew.

36:25.808 --> 36:27.310
Leave us to the devils.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.170
Where is she?

37:47.181 --> 37:48.766
Well, no wolf took Bailey.

37:52.186 --> 37:53.020
Mr. Core?

37:53.604 --> 37:54.647
I'ma need to keep this.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.949
What time is it? Midnight?

38:06.450 --> 38:07.285
6 p.m.

38:09.078 --> 38:09.996
That can't be.

38:10.705 --> 38:11.539
It...

38:11.706 --> 38:13.791
It was dark when I returned.

38:14.750 --> 38:15.584
Yes.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.254
Well, the sun goes down at 3:30 now.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.631
Comes up at 10 a.m.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.216
You're just not acclimated yet. She strangled him.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.060
Someone did.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.187
No, it was her.

38:36.022 --> 38:40.067
Her truck's gone. She packed.
And she left me here to find him.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.485
Why would she do that?

38:43.946 --> 38:45.781
Why are you the fucking police?

38:59.587 --> 39:01.213
Someone should tell the father.

39:01.839 --> 39:02.757
We sent word.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.342
You know him?

39:06.010 --> 39:06.969
We know Vernon.

39:08.721 --> 39:09.555
Yeah.

39:13.726 --> 39:14.769
You can't stay here.

39:19.815 --> 39:20.941
You okay to drive?

39:56.435 --> 39:57.311
Mr. Core?

39:57.895 --> 40:00.439
Mr. Core, think you could stick
around for a day or two?

40:00.523 --> 40:01.357
Why?

40:01.982 --> 40:04.026
There's probably gonna
be some more questions.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.152
I don't...

40:07.196 --> 40:09.323
You need to talk to those villagers.

40:09.949 --> 40:10.825
Oh, we did. Let's see...

40:15.121 --> 40:17.790
Medora Slone is possessed by a wolf-demon.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.209
It is called aÂ <i>tournaq.</i>

40:20.751 --> 40:23.754
She slips her own skin,
her blood is cursed, and...

40:24.922 --> 40:25.840
It keeps going.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.593
That's what you get
when you talk to the villagers.

40:30.636 --> 40:32.096
If they talk to you at all.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.724
I need a statement from you, Mr. Core.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.227
It would help us immensely.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.566
Just use your own words.

40:44.775 --> 40:45.734
Short and sweet.

40:53.617 --> 40:54.952
You sure she did this?

40:55.703 --> 40:56.579
Tell me how.

40:57.913 --> 40:59.081
When I...

40:59.748 --> 41:01.792
When I encountered the wolves,

41:01.876 --> 41:04.753
they were in the act
of devouring one of their own.

41:05.671 --> 41:06.505
A pup.

41:07.756 --> 41:09.383
It's not uncommon at all.

41:10.217 --> 41:12.261
When resources are scarce

41:12.344 --> 41:15.055
or there are unnatural stresses,

41:15.139 --> 41:17.141
some of the young may be killed

41:17.558 --> 41:18.893
to preserve the group.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.147
The behavioral term is "savaging."

41:26.609 --> 41:29.028
Do not talk about animals here, Mr. Core.

41:31.405 --> 41:32.323
If you say so.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.869
Try and get some rest.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.830
Get a hot bath. Get the chill off.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.199
How'd that feel?

42:19.328 --> 42:20.621
It felt real good.

42:28.254 --> 42:29.088
What?

42:32.091 --> 42:33.842
You killed a person before.

42:35.427 --> 42:36.512
Who told you that?

42:37.596 --> 42:38.430
Mama.

42:40.641 --> 42:43.143
My teacher said it's bad to kill people.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.689
Yeah, you'll hear that a lot.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.484
So, it's good?

42:51.402 --> 42:52.319
If you have to.

42:53.821 --> 42:54.655
Why?

42:56.532 --> 42:59.076
To protect what you love
and what you need.

43:05.332 --> 43:06.417
When I go away...

43:07.418 --> 43:09.003
I'll always be with you.

43:16.635 --> 43:17.553
Don't lie.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.256
Those my boots?

44:41.720 --> 44:42.554
Yes.

44:45.557 --> 44:47.267
You're the one, found my boy?

44:51.063 --> 44:51.897
Yes.

45:00.239 --> 45:01.699
Vern, listen...

45:02.908 --> 45:05.828
We're gonna get her picture out,
talk to the mounties.

45:05.911 --> 45:06.912
We're coordinating.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.958
We got leads,
some possible sightings here.

45:11.333 --> 45:14.253
We're gonna find her,
and she will answer for it.

45:16.714 --> 45:17.715
Thank you.

45:17.881 --> 45:18.716
Vern?

45:19.341 --> 45:21.385
Mr. Core here, was called by your wife.

45:21.468 --> 45:23.429
He's a writer.

45:24.012 --> 45:25.139
He studies wolves.

45:25.973 --> 45:29.309
He was the last person to see her.
He's been a big help to us so far.

45:29.393 --> 45:32.146
So, we asked him to be here
in case you had any questions.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.151
Can you raise the dead?

45:41.405 --> 45:42.322
No, sir.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.829
Then, I have no questions for you.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.131
Now? Alright.

47:13.789 --> 47:14.748
Remember me.

47:24.675 --> 47:25.717
Remember me.

47:57.624 --> 48:00.419
Vernon, I'm truly sorry for your loss.

48:02.921 --> 48:06.300
I'll keep you informed.
It's statewide, all points, so...

48:07.718 --> 48:08.844
It'll be over soon.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.149
Alright. Wolfman.

49:21.500 --> 49:22.960
Can you figure her mind?

49:25.462 --> 49:26.463
Jesus God...

49:27.547 --> 49:28.882
a fucking thing like this.

49:30.759 --> 49:32.302
What on earth have we come to?

49:34.304 --> 49:35.263
You know...

49:36.014 --> 49:38.517
I read, postpartum can go on
for years sometimes.

49:38.600 --> 49:39.977
Shut the fuck up, Mike.

49:40.477 --> 49:41.395
Here.

49:45.023 --> 49:46.191
Don't worry, Vernon.

49:46.358 --> 49:48.986
Someone may have spotted her truck
by the old mine.

49:49.069 --> 49:50.779
And we've got these leads.

49:50.862 --> 49:52.906
She'll stand trial
and she'll get the needle.

49:54.783 --> 49:55.617
Don't! What?

50:20.809 --> 50:21.643
Nothing. You mind?

50:29.651 --> 50:30.527
No, go ahead.

52:29.688 --> 52:31.982
Heat shed behind the school,

52:33.984 --> 52:34.860
blue Bronco.

52:36.444 --> 52:38.655
Go on, brother. I'll buy you time.

52:41.116 --> 52:43.493
If you got to go to ground,
Shan's still got his place.

52:43.910 --> 52:44.744
I won't.

52:59.217 --> 53:00.552
I'm sorry about Alessie.

53:03.805 --> 53:05.599
It ain't right, you don't have her body.

53:11.146 --> 53:13.023
That's got nothing to do with anything.

53:14.608 --> 53:15.483
You know this.

55:06.177 --> 55:08.930
You come to punish the old witch,

55:09.514 --> 55:10.849
Vernon Slone.

55:12.809 --> 55:13.852
You think I knew?

55:15.603 --> 55:17.272
You think I could've stopped her?

55:18.732 --> 55:19.733
An old woman?

55:24.070 --> 55:26.448
Go to your father's grave and ask him.

55:28.116 --> 55:30.368
Take your wrath to the gods,

55:30.994 --> 55:32.579
to the wolves...

55:34.331 --> 55:35.582
to yourself.

55:35.665 --> 55:36.541
End it.

55:37.208 --> 55:39.794
You should've died out there in the sand,

55:39.878 --> 55:41.379
but you did not accept it.

55:42.297 --> 55:43.965
You had to come home to see.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.320
It's not the first time the wolves came.

56:06.863 --> 56:09.240
The white people called it influenza.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.327
We called it <i>peelak.</i>

56:14.621 --> 56:15.830
I was a little girl.

56:19.250 --> 56:21.086
Half the village,

56:22.212 --> 56:25.340
their bodies in igloos on the hill.

56:26.925 --> 56:28.468
But the wolves came at night.

56:31.638 --> 56:32.764
In the morning,

56:34.140 --> 56:36.393
the hillside was scattered

56:36.476 --> 56:38.770
with pieces of their bodies.

56:39.896 --> 56:42.690
There's no proper burial after that.

56:45.110 --> 56:47.612
That is our history here.

56:51.616 --> 56:54.285
You can't blame an old woman for it.

57:09.217 --> 57:11.636
<i>Alaska State University, Anthropology.</i>

57:11.845 --> 57:16.015
May I please speak to Ms.<i> </i>Core, please?

57:16.641 --> 57:17.517
<i>Who's calling?</i>

57:17.934 --> 57:19.185
This is her father.

57:20.979 --> 57:21.813
<i>One moment.</i>

57:23.857 --> 57:25.984
<i>You have reached the office</i>
<i>of Amy Core.</i>

57:26.276 --> 57:29.446
<i>Please leave your name,</i>
<i>number, and a brief message,</i>

57:29.904 --> 57:31.990
<i>and I'll return your call</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

57:32.073 --> 57:33.116
<i>Happy holidays.</i>

57:33.575 --> 57:34.993
Hey, sweetie,

57:35.493 --> 57:36.327
it's...

57:37.245 --> 57:38.329
it's me.

57:39.497 --> 57:40.331
I am...

57:41.166 --> 57:42.750
I know it's been awhile,

57:43.626 --> 57:45.211
but I'm out here...

57:45.712 --> 57:46.546
I...

57:49.382 --> 57:50.425
should've...

57:51.551 --> 57:52.385
I'd...

57:53.011 --> 57:55.430
really like to hear from you...

57:55.972 --> 57:56.931
right now.

57:58.141 --> 57:58.975
Okay?

57:59.684 --> 58:04.856
It's 302-4025.

58:06.232 --> 58:07.066
I'll...

58:07.525 --> 58:09.068
I'll be in the room.

58:11.321 --> 58:12.155
I love you.

58:13.948 --> 58:16.242
And I'm sorry to bother you at work.

58:43.853 --> 58:46.064
There's something wrong with the sky.

59:53.339 --> 59:54.841
<i>Operator. What's your emergency?</i>

59:54.924 --> 59:57.510
I... No, I don't have an emergency.

59:57.594 --> 1:00:00.263
I need to speak
with the station, please.

1:00:06.561 --> 1:00:07.395
Hello?

1:00:07.478 --> 1:00:08.313
<i>Emery Police.</i>

1:00:08.521 --> 1:00:10.189
Detective Marium, please.

1:00:10.273 --> 1:00:11.357
<i>Marium isn't available.</i>

1:00:12.025 --> 1:00:13.401
Well, is there anyone--

1:00:13.484 --> 1:00:14.736
<i>Sir, what's the message?</i>

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:15.737
Please tell him,

1:00:16.237 --> 1:00:20.116
in Keelut there was an elderly woman
that I spoke to...

1:01:09.582 --> 1:01:11.834
What a goddamn shitty way to end the year.

1:01:13.169 --> 1:01:14.045
Boss?

1:01:16.339 --> 1:01:17.340
There's more.

1:01:17.924 --> 1:01:19.967
-Another body?
-Yeah.

1:01:21.010 --> 1:01:21.928
And one less.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:40.822
Jesus Christ, Vernon.

1:01:43.950 --> 1:01:45.201
We have to go to Keelut.

1:01:47.161 --> 1:01:47.995
Right now. Who?

1:01:53.251 --> 1:01:54.168
Everybody.

1:02:46.929 --> 1:02:47.805
Hello?

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:57.607
Ma'am? Hey...

1:03:38.314 --> 1:03:39.148
Hey. Hey.

1:03:43.027 --> 1:03:43.861
Wait. Hey, Arnie.

1:04:09.220 --> 1:04:10.555
Just give me a minute or two.

1:04:43.212 --> 1:04:45.214
Told 'em I'd come and try to talk to you.

1:04:46.632 --> 1:04:48.843
See if I could get you
to come out without any mess.

1:04:50.303 --> 1:04:52.930
I'm not saying we're friends,
but we've been friendly, Cheeon.

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:54.682
If you say so, guy.

1:05:00.062 --> 1:05:02.565
-We got two dead cops in town.
-Oh, yeah?

1:05:03.232 --> 1:05:05.943
Around here, a couple
of dead cops is cause for a party.

1:05:06.527 --> 1:05:07.361
And the coroner?

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.949
Frank was set to retire
to San Diego next month.

1:05:14.076 --> 1:05:15.369
San Diego, huh?

1:05:17.455 --> 1:05:18.456
Never heard of it.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.377
They were shot
with a .45 Springfield, Cheeon.

1:05:24.754 --> 1:05:26.380
You got one of those registered.

1:05:27.131 --> 1:05:28.883
I got lots not registered, yeah?

1:05:28.966 --> 1:05:30.092
Oh, I know that.

1:05:31.719 --> 1:05:32.887
But, like I'm saying...

1:05:35.890 --> 1:05:38.059
I told them I'd come
and try to talk to you.

1:05:39.518 --> 1:05:40.978
Damn sure doing that.

1:05:46.651 --> 1:05:47.485
Where's Vernon?

1:05:51.864 --> 1:05:54.033
Can you at least tell me
where the boy's body is? That boy's nothing to your kind anymore.

1:05:57.828 --> 1:05:59.330
He's no longer of the earth.

1:06:00.539 --> 1:06:01.415
And Medora?

1:06:01.958 --> 1:06:02.792
Oh,

1:06:03.167 --> 1:06:04.377
she'll be found.

1:06:05.211 --> 1:06:06.128
Not by you.

1:06:06.420 --> 1:06:07.838
Is that why this is happening?

1:06:09.298 --> 1:06:11.592
So nobody interferes with his revenge?

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:16.555
Do I look like I enjoy all these fucking
questions from you, guy?

1:06:21.102 --> 1:06:21.936
Cheeon.

1:06:22.853 --> 1:06:24.355
I know wolves took your girl,

1:06:24.438 --> 1:06:26.607
and I know you don't have a body to bury,

1:06:26.691 --> 1:06:29.151
and I can't imagine
anything worse than that.

1:06:29.777 --> 1:06:31.570
-You know, huh?
<i>-Watch it!</i>

1:06:32.363 --> 1:06:34.323
Lot of help from a guy who knows.

1:06:36.325 --> 1:06:39.328
You drive an hour out here
for my sorry ass?

1:06:39.745 --> 1:06:42.248
And won't do shit
for some dead kids in the hills.

1:06:42.790 --> 1:06:43.624
We came.

1:06:43.708 --> 1:06:46.002
You came the next day,

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:47.169
and left.

1:06:48.045 --> 1:06:49.547
And never came back.

1:06:53.092 --> 1:06:55.302
Worthless as shit, you city boys.

1:06:56.137 --> 1:06:57.388
We came out here,

1:06:57.471 --> 1:06:59.515
we helped put you guys
on the grid a few years back.

1:06:59.598 --> 1:07:01.308
We got you plumbing, we got you electric--

1:07:01.392 --> 1:07:02.810
Now you want a trophy

1:07:02.893 --> 1:07:05.896
for letting these folks take a shit
in their own houses?

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:07.565
Okay, you know what? You're right.

1:07:08.816 --> 1:07:10.901
You are right, Cheeon.
Things are bad here.

1:07:10.985 --> 1:07:13.529
I admit that,
but let's not make them worse.

1:07:16.615 --> 1:07:18.159
You got a wife who needs you.

1:07:20.411 --> 1:07:21.245
She's gone.

1:07:23.330 --> 1:07:25.416
She'll never be back after what happened.

1:07:28.711 --> 1:07:31.213
This place'll be a ghost town
by next year.

1:07:32.548 --> 1:07:33.382
You watch.

1:07:36.761 --> 1:07:38.220
Those bastards at the morgue.

1:07:40.097 --> 1:07:41.932
Bastards like you and me.

1:07:44.810 --> 1:07:45.895
When we're killed,

1:07:46.270 --> 1:07:47.354
the past is killed.

1:07:49.148 --> 1:07:50.316
When kids are killed...

1:07:53.319 --> 1:07:54.195
that's different.

1:07:57.406 --> 1:07:59.408
When kids are killed, the future dies.

1:08:00.409 --> 1:08:02.161
There's no life without a future.

1:08:03.496 --> 1:08:04.330
Cheeon. Please.

1:08:12.296 --> 1:08:15.299
Those boys look like they don't know
whether to shit or piss.

1:08:18.761 --> 1:08:20.179
I'm not going to lie to you.

1:08:22.181 --> 1:08:23.432
Most of 'em are green.

1:08:25.309 --> 1:08:27.186
They've never seen anything
like this before.

1:08:27.269 --> 1:08:30.022
They are scared to death,
and that is dangerous for you.

1:08:30.189 --> 1:08:31.023
Want me to what?

1:08:31.107 --> 1:08:32.650
Come out with your hands up?

1:08:32.733 --> 1:08:33.609
Like that, guy?

1:08:35.778 --> 1:08:36.612
Listen here.

1:08:41.033 --> 1:08:42.368
That's never gonna happen.

1:08:50.084 --> 1:08:51.919
I promise I'll make everything fair.

1:09:01.846 --> 1:09:02.680
That's good.

1:09:12.148 --> 1:09:13.524
Think about what I offered.

1:09:16.527 --> 1:09:19.238
You think about the phone call
your wife will get today.

1:09:20.447 --> 1:09:21.574
Her hand on the belly.

1:09:23.325 --> 1:09:25.411
Nothing gonna stop that call now, guy.

1:09:37.882 --> 1:09:38.716
What'd he say?

1:09:40.009 --> 1:09:41.927
He said, "Fuck you." That's what he said.

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:42.845
Jesus Christ.

1:09:44.013 --> 1:09:44.889
Okay, now what? I got to...

1:09:47.183 --> 1:09:49.727
I got to wait for Holy Cross
to send a tactical unit out.

1:09:50.311 --> 1:09:52.062
That's two hours out, boss.

1:09:57.693 --> 1:09:59.028
Set up a perimeter.

1:09:59.445 --> 1:10:00.988
Get some coffee and sandwiches.

1:10:01.405 --> 1:10:02.239
Hey...

1:10:02.489 --> 1:10:03.324
Hey, watch it!

1:10:06.702 --> 1:10:07.828
Get down! Get down!

1:10:09.079 --> 1:10:10.456
Second floor window!

1:10:11.624 --> 1:10:13.125
I said, get down! Get down!

1:10:18.339 --> 1:10:19.173
Stay down!

1:10:20.883 --> 1:10:21.759
Take cover!

1:10:36.982 --> 1:10:38.192
He's hit bad!

1:11:01.799 --> 1:11:03.425
Spread out your weapons!

1:11:23.404 --> 1:11:24.280
They're en route!

1:11:42.298 --> 1:11:43.841
-Hey, Arnie, we got to go!
-Yeah, okay!

1:11:43.924 --> 1:11:45.134
-Okay? Right now!
-Okay, okay!

1:11:54.143 --> 1:11:54.977
You cover me!

1:11:55.060 --> 1:11:56.228
Arnie, you okay?

1:12:20.461 --> 1:12:21.378
He's out!

1:12:21.712 --> 1:12:22.963
Move in! Move in!

1:12:24.631 --> 1:12:25.466
We got to go!

1:12:25.549 --> 1:12:26.467
Come on now! Move!

1:12:26.550 --> 1:12:27.426
-Okay!
-Move now!

1:12:29.053 --> 1:12:30.012
Get to cover!

1:12:31.638 --> 1:12:32.473
He's coming out!

1:12:52.117 --> 1:12:53.077
You got a full magazine?

1:12:54.036 --> 1:12:54.870
It's full. Please check.

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:00.918
See? It's full.

1:13:05.964 --> 1:13:07.841
Arnie, listen to me now.

1:13:08.884 --> 1:13:10.094
You stay behind this rock.

1:13:10.677 --> 1:13:12.179
His weapon can't get through this rock.

1:13:12.262 --> 1:13:14.098
-You stay here. You understand?
-Yes.

1:13:14.181 --> 1:13:16.892
I'm gonna make a run for the house.
The very second I go running,

1:13:16.975 --> 1:13:19.603
you unload at that window,
and do not stop until I reach the house.

1:13:19.686 --> 1:13:21.313
-Okay.
-What will you do?

1:13:22.689 --> 1:13:23.857
Stay here and...

1:13:24.775 --> 1:13:25.651
Window, window!

1:13:26.235 --> 1:13:27.903
-The second I run.
-Yes.

1:13:28.737 --> 1:13:29.863
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1:13:46.255 --> 1:13:48.215
-Hit him! Hit him!
-Take him out!

1:14:27.754 --> 1:14:28.589
Help!

1:14:30.174 --> 1:14:31.008
Help me! Help me!

1:15:00.162 --> 1:15:00.996
Help!

1:15:01.079 --> 1:15:02.206
Corey!

1:15:04.958 --> 1:15:05.792
Stay there! Help!

1:15:11.632 --> 1:15:12.466
Help me!

1:15:15.093 --> 1:15:16.094
Help me!

1:15:16.178 --> 1:15:17.137
What're you doing? What're you doing?

1:16:25.706 --> 1:16:26.707
I'm gonna die!

1:16:26.915 --> 1:16:27.958
I'm gonna die!

1:16:28.041 --> 1:16:29.001
No, you're not.

1:16:34.256 --> 1:16:35.132
I'm inside.

1:16:36.133 --> 1:16:37.718
<i>Take cover and hold your fire.</i>

1:16:56.069 --> 1:16:56.903
Stop it!

1:17:32.939 --> 1:17:35.108
You stopped
that phone call for today, guy.

1:17:37.819 --> 1:17:39.071
Phone call to your wife.

1:17:42.074 --> 1:17:43.408
But it's coming, ain't it?

1:17:47.788 --> 1:17:48.622
The call.

1:17:50.248 --> 1:17:51.208
It's always coming.

1:17:57.381 --> 1:17:58.215
Boo!

1:20:53.723 --> 1:20:56.643
Kind of late in the season for travelers?

1:20:57.769 --> 1:20:58.979
Where did you come from?

1:20:59.646 --> 1:21:00.480
Keelut.

1:21:03.024 --> 1:21:05.235
There's no road from there to here.

1:21:05.861 --> 1:21:06.903
Not directly.

1:21:07.237 --> 1:21:08.071
No.

1:21:14.953 --> 1:21:16.496
I was here when I was a child.

1:21:19.833 --> 1:21:20.876
With my father.

1:21:22.711 --> 1:21:24.045
We visited this camp.

1:21:26.923 --> 1:21:27.966
I remember it.

1:21:38.268 --> 1:21:39.102
Was she here?

1:21:41.688 --> 1:21:44.065
What? They don't got women up in Keelut?

1:21:44.816 --> 1:21:47.277
Got to crawl all the way
up here for a piece?

1:21:47.777 --> 1:21:48.904
Can you help me?

1:21:50.864 --> 1:21:52.908
Ain't got any bread, got to warn you.

1:21:52.991 --> 1:21:55.118
Plane hasn't been in for two weeks, but...

1:21:55.660 --> 1:21:57.162
I've got a room to let.

1:21:58.496 --> 1:22:00.582
I'd make sure it was warm.

1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:05.879
Yeah, she was here.

1:22:06.755 --> 1:22:09.174
That one in your picture there.

1:22:10.133 --> 1:22:12.719
You know, they don't make
that kind of film anymore.

1:22:14.804 --> 1:22:15.639
When?

1:22:17.349 --> 1:22:18.475
Two nights ago.

1:22:19.517 --> 1:22:21.937
Said she wanted to see our Indian hunter.

1:22:22.187 --> 1:22:24.773
He's not really Indian, though.
He's just John.

1:22:24.940 --> 1:22:25.774
Why?

1:22:26.650 --> 1:22:28.151
She didn't share that.

1:22:28.526 --> 1:22:29.903
And I didn't ask.

1:22:29.986 --> 1:22:31.529
I want to see the room she took.

1:22:31.613 --> 1:22:33.073
There's only two rooms.

1:22:33.156 --> 1:22:34.532
The other one's mine.

1:22:36.576 --> 1:22:38.536
Hadn't actually changed the sheets yet.

1:22:38.620 --> 1:22:39.871
I hope you don't mind.

1:23:19.911 --> 1:23:20.996
The Indian hunter.

1:23:58.575 --> 1:23:59.409
Come eat.

1:24:16.259 --> 1:24:18.053
How much longer do you have?

1:24:21.639 --> 1:24:22.599
February.

1:24:23.892 --> 1:24:24.976
Almost here.

1:24:27.020 --> 1:24:28.229
Do you know what you're having?

1:24:30.607 --> 1:24:32.525
-He wants a boy, though.
-No, I...

1:24:33.902 --> 1:24:35.862
Fogey like me having his first kid?

1:24:37.238 --> 1:24:38.823
I'll take whatever I can get.

1:24:38.907 --> 1:24:40.325
What are you 40?

1:24:41.409 --> 1:24:42.243
43. Fogey, huh?

1:24:45.997 --> 1:24:46.915
Let me trade you.

1:24:53.338 --> 1:24:54.172
You a father? Yes.

1:25:00.053 --> 1:25:00.929
What's that like?

1:25:03.223 --> 1:25:04.182
Amazing.

1:25:09.187 --> 1:25:11.397
I wish I'd understood
that better at the time.

1:25:12.649 --> 1:25:13.900
I guess I...

1:25:14.901 --> 1:25:16.820
I guess I wasn't much help to her.

1:25:19.114 --> 1:25:21.741
You like to think you're devoted
to your child.

1:25:22.700 --> 1:25:25.870
And you tell people this,
"I'd do anything for 'em, anything."

1:25:26.955 --> 1:25:27.789
And...

1:25:29.666 --> 1:25:33.044
it feels correct in your mouth
when you say it, but...

1:25:35.421 --> 1:25:37.298
And you just go ahead with your life.

1:25:39.926 --> 1:25:41.427
She's in Anchorage now,

1:25:41.511 --> 1:25:42.470
a teacher.

1:25:44.347 --> 1:25:47.142
That's part of why I came here.

1:25:47.934 --> 1:25:48.768
I...

1:25:49.269 --> 1:25:50.979
was hoping I'd be able to see her. But... Well...

1:25:57.402 --> 1:25:58.236
We'll see.

1:26:02.532 --> 1:26:04.492
How are you from this region, I wonder?

1:26:06.327 --> 1:26:07.662
You look Nordic to me.

1:26:08.788 --> 1:26:09.622
Woman, too.

1:26:11.416 --> 1:26:12.667
Same hair as you.

1:26:13.459 --> 1:26:14.586
Same eyes.

1:26:18.131 --> 1:26:19.841
She knows you're coming for her.

1:26:21.843 --> 1:26:23.469
You let her go from here?

1:26:25.096 --> 1:26:26.931
I've seen mothers kill their young.

1:26:27.557 --> 1:26:28.683
See it out here a lot.

1:26:29.684 --> 1:26:32.353
Ain't no decree in the country.
It don't reach here.

1:26:35.190 --> 1:26:36.608
I help who comes asking.

1:26:41.779 --> 1:26:43.531
I remember you, traveler.

1:26:44.616 --> 1:26:46.910
Just a little tyke last time you was here.

1:26:46.993 --> 1:26:47.952
Sure.

1:26:48.786 --> 1:26:49.704
Why did we come?

1:26:49.871 --> 1:26:50.788
To see me.

1:26:51.831 --> 1:26:53.541
Your daddy wanted wolf's oil.

1:26:54.250 --> 1:26:55.627
For you. Do you know that?

1:26:56.961 --> 1:26:58.171
He said you was...

1:26:59.088 --> 1:26:59.964
"unnatural."

1:27:00.048 --> 1:27:01.174
That was his word.

1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:03.301
Unnatural.

1:27:07.222 --> 1:27:10.433
An Indian witch from his village said
wolf's oil could cure you.

1:27:12.018 --> 1:27:12.894
Did it work?

1:27:13.811 --> 1:27:14.979
I gave him the oil.

1:27:17.232 --> 1:27:18.066
Where'd she go?

1:27:19.234 --> 1:27:20.401
Not my business.

1:27:21.819 --> 1:27:23.738
Fixed her up with some boots I'd made.

1:27:27.742 --> 1:27:29.369
She left her mask, though.

1:27:31.871 --> 1:27:33.289
I don't know how she got it.

1:27:34.165 --> 1:27:37.126
I share 'em with travelers
and they find a way to-- who needs 'em.

1:27:39.254 --> 1:27:41.089
You are welcome to one, boy.

1:27:54.143 --> 1:27:56.145
When was the last time you wore a mask?

1:28:19.794 --> 1:28:22.297
I can see you need
to let the wolf out a little.

1:28:26.342 --> 1:28:27.635
They all do out here.

1:28:28.928 --> 1:28:29.762
It's true. It's truth.

1:31:26.856 --> 1:31:27.690
Fuck!

1:31:31.402 --> 1:31:32.695
Goddamn, Vern.

1:31:34.030 --> 1:31:35.239
Get me Cheeon.

1:31:36.324 --> 1:31:37.283
Cheeon?

1:31:38.826 --> 1:31:40.286
Where the fuck you been, man?

1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:45.374
I'm sorry, man.

1:31:47.376 --> 1:31:48.961
I know you two were close.

1:31:51.047 --> 1:31:53.758
Cheeon never did like cops, but goddamn...

1:31:53.966 --> 1:31:55.927
Made himself a bloodbath up there.

1:32:00.264 --> 1:32:01.432
And the other thing.

1:32:02.433 --> 1:32:03.434
Bailey.

1:32:04.018 --> 1:32:07.188
They said that on the news.
It's just a fucking nightmare, man.

1:32:07.271 --> 1:32:08.272
It's just senseless.

1:32:09.857 --> 1:32:10.691
Fuck.

1:32:16.822 --> 1:32:18.157
So, who shot you?

1:32:20.576 --> 1:32:21.452
A woman.

1:32:22.370 --> 1:32:23.204
Yeah, well...

1:32:24.372 --> 1:32:26.207
Who ain't been shot by a woman, right?

1:32:28.543 --> 1:32:30.253
Here you go. Take these.

1:32:31.337 --> 1:32:32.171
Come on.

1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:38.719
Pull on this.

1:32:41.264 --> 1:32:43.099
It's gonna hurt like a motherfucker.

1:32:44.267 --> 1:32:45.268
Don't worry, Vern.

1:32:46.310 --> 1:32:47.478
We'll get you fixed up.

1:32:49.855 --> 1:32:51.232
Get some hot soup in you.

1:32:51.315 --> 1:32:52.358
What kind?

1:32:54.110 --> 1:32:54.944
What?

1:32:55.736 --> 1:32:56.821
What kind of soup?

1:32:59.532 --> 1:33:00.700
Campbell's chicken.

1:33:02.702 --> 1:33:03.703
I like tomato.

1:33:04.829 --> 1:33:06.080
You been fucking shot, man.

1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:08.583
Fucking tomato.

1:33:23.431 --> 1:33:25.725
Did you ever see anything
like that today?

1:33:29.353 --> 1:33:30.980
Kicked in a meth lab once.

1:33:33.190 --> 1:33:35.860
Guy took a couple shots at me with a .22.

1:33:36.611 --> 1:33:37.445
Purse gun.

1:33:37.903 --> 1:33:39.322
Sounded like bubble wrap.

1:33:40.656 --> 1:33:41.782
He missed every shot.

1:33:43.618 --> 1:33:45.411
Never been so scared in my life.

1:33:45.911 --> 1:33:46.746
But...

1:33:51.125 --> 1:33:53.127
No, I've never seen anything like today.

1:34:04.263 --> 1:34:05.097
Well...

1:34:05.765 --> 1:34:07.266
you handled yourself.

1:34:11.354 --> 1:34:12.938
I gave him what he wanted.

1:34:19.904 --> 1:34:21.781
Slone killed that old woman.

1:34:25.785 --> 1:34:26.619
Yeah. Why?

1:34:31.248 --> 1:34:34.377
I can't presume to know what goes
through Vernon Slone's head.

1:34:36.170 --> 1:34:37.213
Why any of it?

1:34:39.215 --> 1:34:41.092
Why did Medora do what she did?

1:34:42.218 --> 1:34:44.053
I'm not convinced the answers exist.

1:34:44.345 --> 1:34:45.179
They do.

1:34:48.349 --> 1:34:51.769
Whether or not they fit
in our experience is another matter.

1:34:54.897 --> 1:34:55.815
What do you think?

1:34:58.609 --> 1:34:59.819
I'm no cop.

1:35:03.531 --> 1:35:04.824
You studied behavior.

1:35:07.952 --> 1:35:09.578
It's like she wanted to fix him.

1:35:10.454 --> 1:35:11.664
Save him. I don't know.

1:35:14.041 --> 1:35:15.626
Save him by destroying.

1:35:17.837 --> 1:35:19.213
It happens in medicine.

1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:22.007
Chemotherapy.

1:35:24.093 --> 1:35:25.177
Save him from what?

1:35:26.554 --> 1:35:27.555
Darkness.

1:35:29.515 --> 1:35:30.474
In her.

1:35:31.851 --> 1:35:32.685
In him.

1:35:34.228 --> 1:35:35.563
Outside her window.

1:35:39.316 --> 1:35:40.985
She told me about it, but...

1:35:43.821 --> 1:35:44.780
I wasn't listening.

1:35:46.657 --> 1:35:48.492
I think that's why she wrote me.

1:35:49.201 --> 1:35:52.246
She wanted a witness to tell her story.

1:35:53.664 --> 1:35:54.498
And...

1:35:57.334 --> 1:35:58.419
to be punished.

1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:07.178
Well, you're the story guy.

1:36:09.555 --> 1:36:10.931
And as for the second part.

1:36:13.142 --> 1:36:15.728
All she had to do was wait
for Vernon to get home.

1:36:17.354 --> 1:36:19.273
And if he gets to her before we do...

1:36:20.733 --> 1:36:22.526
Damn sure gonna get her wish.

1:36:39.627 --> 1:36:41.754
I swear to God, when all this is over,

1:36:41.837 --> 1:36:43.798
I'm taking Susan on a vacation.

1:36:46.717 --> 1:36:47.593
Caribbean.

1:36:50.346 --> 1:36:51.347
Hot sand.

1:36:52.848 --> 1:36:53.724
Blue water.

1:37:02.274 --> 1:37:03.108
What?

1:37:06.904 --> 1:37:08.614
A good place to get clean.

1:37:13.077 --> 1:37:13.994
I don't know.

1:37:15.996 --> 1:37:17.790
I can't tell from this.

1:37:18.541 --> 1:37:20.417
It was north of Keelut.

1:37:21.502 --> 1:37:23.504
But I'm not sure how long
I'd been walking.

1:37:25.673 --> 1:37:27.049
I think it's worth the chance.

1:37:28.217 --> 1:37:31.095
And if we can find her that might be
just as good as finding him.

1:37:31.178 --> 1:37:33.222
I'd know if I saw it again.

1:37:41.647 --> 1:37:42.481
Is that it? Hurry!

1:38:21.937 --> 1:38:24.315
We can stay in this place forever.

1:38:43.167 --> 1:38:45.377
No, I am saying he is here right now.

1:38:45.461 --> 1:38:46.921
He is in my house.

1:38:49.256 --> 1:38:51.342
No, he is passed out,
but I don't know for how long,

1:38:51.425 --> 1:38:53.010
so get your people out here pronto,

1:38:53.093 --> 1:38:54.803
and I want my special consideration.

1:39:00.935 --> 1:39:03.187
Fuck is that?
It's Christmas not Halloween.

1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:05.481
Get back in bed.
You'll start bleeding again.

1:39:12.029 --> 1:39:13.155
I'm in trouble, Vern.

1:39:15.366 --> 1:39:17.076
It's those pills. I'm fucked up.

1:39:17.910 --> 1:39:18.827
They got me

1:39:19.411 --> 1:39:20.871
and I'm looking at real time,

1:39:21.830 --> 1:39:23.415
but I was gonna wake you up.

1:39:24.208 --> 1:39:26.126
You know? I'd get my good citizen points,

1:39:26.210 --> 1:39:28.921
and you'd be gone before they got here.

1:39:29.004 --> 1:39:30.089
So it's no harm done.

1:39:33.342 --> 1:39:36.595
Hey. I saved your life, motherfucker.

1:39:36.762 --> 1:39:37.596
Okay?

1:39:37.805 --> 1:39:39.264
You came. You asked for help.

1:39:39.348 --> 1:39:40.265
And I helped you.

1:39:40.349 --> 1:39:41.725
After what you did?

1:39:47.398 --> 1:39:49.525
We've known each other since we were kids.

1:39:52.069 --> 1:39:53.112
Okay. Fuck you.

1:39:54.196 --> 1:39:55.990
Fuck you, motherfucker! Fuck you!

1:40:23.684 --> 1:40:24.518
Gimme a second? Hey, guys!

1:40:26.770 --> 1:40:28.689
Are you headed for the Kennebeck Camp?

1:40:38.866 --> 1:40:39.700
Yeah, okay.

1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:41.035
Good luck.

1:40:49.501 --> 1:40:50.919
Is it just us?

1:40:51.378 --> 1:40:53.922
An old KA of Slone's
was found this morning

1:40:54.256 --> 1:40:55.758
with a mail slot in his skull.

1:40:58.635 --> 1:41:00.512
Half the guys are going to help with that.

1:41:01.764 --> 1:41:04.516
The other half are going
to the camp search, so yeah.

1:41:05.642 --> 1:41:06.643
I'm afraid,

1:41:07.227 --> 1:41:08.103
it's just us.

1:41:09.646 --> 1:41:11.273
You eyeball it. I'll call it in.

1:41:17.279 --> 1:41:18.113
Besides,

1:41:18.197 --> 1:41:19.990
there's only two seats in this sucker.

1:41:23.786 --> 1:41:24.620
You ready?

1:41:25.329 --> 1:41:26.205
Yeah.

1:42:15.045 --> 1:42:16.505
<i>We gonna beat that storm?</i>

1:42:17.464 --> 1:42:18.423
<i>Got no choice.</i>

1:42:19.508 --> 1:42:20.342
<i>Solstice.</i>

1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:22.928
<i>Already losing light.</i>

1:43:22.154 --> 1:43:23.071
<i>Snow machine.</i>

1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:26.074
<i>Is it moving?</i> <i>No.</i>

1:43:28.619 --> 1:43:29.494
<i>You see anybody?</i>

1:43:30.621 --> 1:43:31.580
<i>Not our lady.</i>

1:43:34.499 --> 1:43:35.459
<i>I could loop back.</i>

1:43:40.923 --> 1:43:41.757
<i>Wait...</i>

1:43:44.843 --> 1:43:46.094
<i>Down in that ravine.</i>

1:43:48.889 --> 1:43:49.723
<i>That's it.</i>

1:43:51.683 --> 1:43:53.143
<i>I can set us down on the ice.</i>

1:44:05.948 --> 1:44:06.865
<i>Fuck.</i>

1:44:29.429 --> 1:44:30.264
<i>Hold on.</i>

1:45:58.810 --> 1:45:59.811
How fresh are they?

1:46:01.355 --> 1:46:02.230
Pretty new.

1:46:04.941 --> 1:46:05.776
Four of them.

1:46:06.610 --> 1:46:07.444
Adults.

1:46:08.528 --> 1:46:10.447
A 100 pounds each, give or take.

1:46:11.573 --> 1:46:12.908
Where's the rest of the pack?

1:46:13.450 --> 1:46:14.743
Not far, I'd guess.

1:46:15.619 --> 1:46:17.329
The den must be nearby.

1:46:19.623 --> 1:46:20.624
Little bit further?

1:46:21.416 --> 1:46:22.459
Yeah.

1:46:24.127 --> 1:46:25.504
If we see anything we'll...

1:46:27.381 --> 1:46:29.341
radio it in and turn back.

1:46:31.426 --> 1:46:32.260
Alright. What is it?

1:46:39.267 --> 1:46:40.477
I saw something.

1:46:50.570 --> 1:46:51.571
He's...

1:47:13.677 --> 1:47:14.511
Donald? Donald?

1:48:57.697 --> 1:48:58.949
Medora Slone.

1:49:01.493 --> 1:49:02.410
Listen to me.

1:49:03.245 --> 1:49:04.246
He's coming for you.

1:49:05.830 --> 1:49:06.957
We have to leave.

1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:09.834
We have to leave now.

1:53:17.707 --> 1:53:19.250
They're looking for you.

1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:28.134
But you found me.

1:53:49.364 --> 1:53:52.534
Now you understand
about the sky, don't you?

1:55:55.073 --> 1:55:56.824
They spared you.

1:55:58.910 --> 1:55:59.786
What?

1:56:01.162 --> 1:56:02.497
They spared you.

1:58:22.970 --> 1:58:24.472
Amy.

1:58:28.726 --> 1:58:29.977
What happened?
