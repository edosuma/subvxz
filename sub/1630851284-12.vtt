WEBVTT

00:06.065 --> 00:07.006
What should we do now?
We've captured the cad

00:07.324 --> 00:08.507
What should we do now?
We've captured the cad

00:08.843 --> 00:12.402
who poisoned all those copper
barons, and it's barely 8:00.

00:12.404 --> 00:16.331
Lucky thing I made
an 8:15 reservation right here.

00:16.408 --> 00:19.259
Why, this is the restaurant
where you proposed.

00:19.411 --> 00:22.246
Oh, you did remember
our anniversary.

00:22.248 --> 00:24.431
Well, look who else remembered.

00:24.583 --> 00:25.599
Aster.

00:25.751 --> 00:27.934
And he's carrying
the Sapphire of Ceylon.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.937
Oh, Mick,
you think of everything.

00:31.090 --> 00:32.031
-Ooh.
-Mmm.

00:32.258 --> 00:34.758
-Aster!
-Oh, let him go.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.852
He can wear it with the diamond
brooch he buried last week.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.854
-Well, I'll drink to that.
-Darling,

00:39.874 --> 00:41.707
you drink to everything.

00:41.934 --> 00:43.751
BOTH:
Mmm.

00:45.104 --> 00:46.770
(sighs):
Oh, when I get married,

00:46.863 --> 00:50.698
I hope I have the breezy
elegance of Mick and Moira.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.444
MARGE: Oh, I'm sure you'll have
what your father and I have.

00:54.463 --> 00:58.891
Yep, ten years,
but we still got that magic.

00:59.042 --> 01:00.267
(belches)

01:02.063 --> 01:03.729
Thanks, sweetie.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.565
Mmm. Ooh, change the channel.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.233
<i> Love It or Lift It</i> is on.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.795
They're going to unwrap
Steven's new face tonight.

01:11.814 --> 01:14.406
Ew, it's covered in Dad cheese.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.651
I'm going to bed.
I'll leave you to your magic.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.304
-(Homer belches)
-(vacuum whirring)

01:20.322 --> 01:21.997
Ew.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.991
(grunting)

01:25.144 --> 01:27.661
Bart, I'm worried
about Mom and Dad.

01:27.813 --> 01:29.404
(grunting)

01:29.423 --> 01:31.090
The mushroom spores
are replicating.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.816
Torch the fungus.

01:32.909 --> 01:34.426
(shouts, grunting)

01:34.653 --> 01:37.321
Lis, I'm holding the ammo
for the whole team.

01:37.323 --> 01:40.081
<i> MILHOUSE (over device):</i>
<i> Bart, I need a reload.</i>

01:40.101 --> 01:42.434
<i> -(lasers blasting)</i>
<i> -Ow! Why do I feel that?</i>

01:42.544 --> 01:45.086
Mom and Dad have
completely given up.

01:45.164 --> 01:49.333
Their relationship
has no spark or romance.

01:49.351 --> 01:52.093
You got me out of my game
for girl words?

01:52.187 --> 01:54.113
They're nothing like
the couples in movies

01:54.264 --> 01:56.506
or prescription drug
commercials.

01:56.525 --> 01:59.843
They don't dance on beaches
or hang glide,

01:59.862 --> 02:01.862
They just watch TV
and DustBust burp dust.

02:01.864 --> 02:02.770
They just watch TV
and DustBust burp dust.

02:03.198 --> 02:05.457
I don't know, this sounds
like another Lisa thing

02:05.534 --> 02:08.627
-that's not actually a thing.
-Come with me.

02:08.778 --> 02:11.446
What are our lovely parents
up to this fine Sunday?

02:11.465 --> 02:14.541
Champagne brunch?
Historic walking tour?

02:14.635 --> 02:19.245
Or is Mom crawling around
on homemade kneepads?

02:19.398 --> 02:22.866
Good news. The only ants
I'm finding are already dead.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.368
Leave the corpses.

02:24.386 --> 02:27.053
It'll send a message
to the colony.

02:27.130 --> 02:28.963
You might be wondering,
"Why does Dad

02:29.057 --> 02:31.799
have a trash can
bungeed to his waist?"

02:31.819 --> 02:34.394
Answer: to catch
his taco droppings.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.970
(muttering)

02:36.064 --> 02:37.881
Homer, if there's room
in your taco trough,

02:37.900 --> 02:39.883
I've got a present from Maggie.

02:39.885 --> 02:40.884
Hip hop.

02:40.886 --> 02:42.143
-Up top.
-(Lisa gasps)

02:42.237 --> 02:45.330
(slow-motion disgusted noises)

02:46.333 --> 02:47.815
Nice throw.

02:47.910 --> 02:50.002
(laughs softly)
Nice catch.

02:50.229 --> 02:51.561
(both shudder)

02:51.580 --> 02:54.339
Okay, it's disturbing,
but that's why,

02:54.491 --> 02:56.508
when it comes to parents,
my policy is:

02:56.735 --> 02:59.178
-"don't look, don't care."
-You should care.

02:59.329 --> 03:02.255
You're gonna live with these two
well into your adult years.

03:02.408 --> 03:04.758
Do you want your future dates
to be greeted

03:04.927 --> 03:07.144
by Captain and Mrs. Underpants?

03:09.081 --> 03:10.689
(softly):
Hey, baby, you look great.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.691
-We got to go.
-HOMER (moaning): Bart,

03:12.918 --> 03:15.009
introduce us.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.738
MARGE (moaning):
We want to see her.

03:19.516 --> 03:23.593
I hope you have
what we have someday.

03:23.595 --> 03:27.931
-BOTH: Couch love. Couch love.
-(screams)

03:27.950 --> 03:30.500
We got to do an intervention.

03:33.772 --> 03:36.048
Mom, Dad, we need to talk.

03:36.275 --> 03:38.533
Not during<i> 21 Days in a Swamp.</i>

03:38.552 --> 03:40.886
They're about to reveal who
they found inside the alligator.

03:41.037 --> 03:42.796
Cody, Cody, Cody, Cody.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.390
First of all,
this is a safe space.

03:45.617 --> 03:47.117
We love you.

03:47.210 --> 03:50.971
But no child should have to see
their parent wear a wastebasket.

03:51.065 --> 03:54.882
-It's...
-All you loads do is sit on
the couch and watch crappy TV.

03:54.902 --> 03:59.404
We watch educational shows
that teach real-world skills,

03:59.631 --> 04:01.556
like hauling crab
out of the Bering Sea.

04:01.633 --> 04:03.967
Do you kids know
how to pull a gaff hook

04:04.060 --> 04:05.986
out of a crabber's forearm?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.062
They know nothing
of the sort, Marge.

04:08.231 --> 04:11.308
You've gotten into a rut.
Look at this room.

04:11.401 --> 04:14.478
Two people, and yet there's,
like, six throw blankets.

04:14.571 --> 04:18.148
There's nine.
Each one serves a vital purpose.

04:18.241 --> 04:19.816
And I think it's sweet

04:19.985 --> 04:22.210
that we're so at ease
with one another.

04:22.245 --> 04:24.488
There's so much
you're missing out on.

04:24.506 --> 04:28.508
Entertaining, travel,
standing upright.

04:28.677 --> 04:30.269
You won the school raffle

04:30.437 --> 04:32.754
for a week at
The Saffron Togetherness Center.

04:32.831 --> 04:37.609
But this voucher has sat
on the fridge for a year.

04:37.761 --> 04:41.838
Ugh, that thing. We were hoping
to win the kettle corn kettle.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.690
But this place sounds perfect.

04:43.842 --> 04:46.601
A tranquil setting
that blissifies coupleosity

04:46.695 --> 04:51.105
by removing the distractions
of technology and entertainment.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.034
The Saffron Center
sounds so romantic.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.369
It's at the top
of Honeymoon Mountain.

04:56.522 --> 04:58.688
Unless you saggy-bottomed
couch monsters

04:58.707 --> 05:00.782
have given up on romance.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.375
What? I love romance.

05:02.528 --> 05:05.787
Romance is like my oxygen.
But your mom doesn't want to go.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.955
Oh. Do you want to go?

05:08.050 --> 05:10.033
Of course I do.

05:10.052 --> 05:12.052
Unless<i> you're</i> not into romance,
no judgment.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.979
I love romance.

05:14.206 --> 05:17.482
-So, we're going.
-Great.

05:17.709 --> 05:19.209
-Great.
-Great.

05:19.378 --> 05:21.469
-It is great.
-Yep.

05:21.563 --> 05:23.563
So great.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.809
<i> MARGE:</i>
<i> Hmm, no phones or television</i>
<i> for the whole week,</i>

05:27.903 --> 05:30.236
and the menu is keto-based.

05:30.331 --> 05:33.406
Are you trying to pronounce
"Cheeto-based"?

05:33.559 --> 05:35.167
-No.
-(moans)

05:35.318 --> 05:37.318
Deep down, I knew
you probably weren't.

05:37.396 --> 05:40.113
There's a group meditation
on Saturday with Sharice.

05:40.265 --> 05:42.232
-What time's it start?
-Sunrise.

05:42.234 --> 05:44.325
We won't be seeing Sharice.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.236
There's silent sweat lodge yoga.

05:46.329 --> 05:48.013
Oh, that's also at sunrise.

05:48.164 --> 05:51.241
Hmm, "sunrise,"
"sunrise," "sunrise."

05:51.334 --> 05:53.835
(gasps)
Ooh, there's a sunset hike.

05:53.929 --> 05:56.838
Nope, that starts at sunrise.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.398
Hmm.

06:00.252 --> 06:03.511
-This place sucks.
-Sucks so hard.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.922
I only wanted to go
because you did.

06:05.941 --> 06:08.182
I never want to go anywhere!

06:08.202 --> 06:09.868
Then turn around, baby.

06:10.019 --> 06:13.263
-We're going home.
-Already turning.

06:13.281 --> 06:14.948
-(tires screeching)
-Homer!

06:15.100 --> 06:17.417
-Turn into the skid.
-I am!

06:18.361 --> 06:20.379
Th-Then turn out of the skid.

06:20.530 --> 06:23.698
(moans)
What does the skid want?

06:23.792 --> 06:26.426
(both screaming)

06:30.966 --> 06:32.632
(panting)

06:32.726 --> 06:35.135
-Uh, are you okay?
-(ragged exhale)

06:35.303 --> 06:37.879
Yes. Yes, I-I think so.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.107
(both sigh)

06:41.443 --> 06:43.443
BOTH:
D'oh!

06:49.426 --> 06:51.076
-(panting)
-(grunts) Rocks!

06:51.227 --> 06:53.328
We have to jump now!

07:01.480 --> 07:03.046
Homer!

07:06.668 --> 07:09.052
(panting, shivering)

07:12.749 --> 07:14.749
Okay, I can pound that dent out.

07:14.843 --> 07:16.826
(car banging)

07:16.845 --> 07:18.161
I'll call AAA.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.755
This seems like a good time
to join.

07:20.832 --> 07:22.348
Okay, no phone, no car.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.943
But we made it out of the water
and we're safe.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.836
Homer, listen to me.

07:26.855 --> 07:30.097
We are not safe.
We are in a dire situation.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.676
We're soaking wet
and it's very cold.

07:32.694 --> 07:34.527
We have to fix that now.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.121
We have to make a fire.

07:36.348 --> 07:39.182
On our survival shows,
they all use a bow drill.

07:39.201 --> 07:42.202
-Find a sapling.
-Or we could do this.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.295
(grunts)

07:44.465 --> 07:45.705
That's amazing!

07:45.799 --> 07:47.949
Where did you learn that?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.784
Remember all those recall
letters that said our phone

07:49.861 --> 07:53.120
-would swell up and explode?
-But you exchanged that phone.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.049
Nope. I<i> said</i> I did.

07:56.201 --> 07:58.292
Okay, fine, fine.
But we have a fire.

07:58.386 --> 08:00.704
Now get those wet clothes off.

08:00.797 --> 08:02.539
In front of the fauna?

08:02.632 --> 08:03.873
Just do it!

08:03.967 --> 08:06.226
Almost dry.

08:06.378 --> 08:09.654
Okay, next step: figure out
the way back to the road.

08:09.806 --> 08:11.990
Help me up that tree.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.217
-(grunting)
-No...

08:14.310 --> 08:15.827
-No, Homer, no.
-I got you.

08:16.054 --> 08:17.053
-Where'd you go?
-Not that way.

08:17.072 --> 08:18.479
-Up or down?
-I'm not up!

08:18.499 --> 08:19.664
-Can't breathe!
-Turn me around.

08:19.816 --> 08:20.907
(muffled speaking)

08:21.001 --> 08:22.742
And watch my thingy!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.836
(muffled speaking)

08:25.063 --> 08:26.004
(grunting)

08:26.155 --> 08:28.231
Ooch. Ooh. Rough bark.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.324
Homer, don't look up.

08:30.418 --> 08:33.345
Ow! Ow...

08:33.496 --> 08:34.237
(grunting)

08:34.256 --> 08:36.089
Dang, my thingy again.

08:36.241 --> 08:37.907
Okay, if you see
more than one road,

08:37.926 --> 08:40.744
we should walk to the one
with a sit-down restaurant,

08:40.746 --> 08:43.688
because I could really go
for a booth.

08:44.933 --> 08:47.174
Oh, no.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.102
All I see are trees.

08:49.254 --> 08:51.588
Nothing but trees.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.940
So... we're lost?

08:54.092 --> 08:57.110
(gasps)
Wait! I see something!

08:57.204 --> 08:58.686
Something bright red!

08:58.705 --> 08:59.946
And it's close by!

09:00.098 --> 09:01.281
Ooh. Ow.

09:01.433 --> 09:02.448
(grunting)

09:02.543 --> 09:05.043
-What'd you see? What is it?
-I don't know.

09:05.194 --> 09:06.193
But it looks man-made.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.104
And right now,
it's our only hope.

09:08.123 --> 09:09.864
Are the clothes dry?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.716
Almost dry.

09:13.795 --> 09:15.036
No, no, no!

09:15.130 --> 09:17.371
This is worse than
<i> Nude and Screwed</i> season six

09:17.465 --> 09:19.224
when Jerry got airlifted out

09:19.451 --> 09:21.968
because howler monkeys bit
his pixilated area!

09:22.062 --> 09:23.970
Homie, I know this looks bad.

09:24.139 --> 09:26.714
We don't have clothes or fire

09:26.808 --> 09:29.475
or shelter or food
or hope of rescue

09:29.552 --> 09:31.811
-or...
-I know what we don't have!

09:31.980 --> 09:33.646
But we have the red thing!

09:33.799 --> 09:35.481
And it's all we have!

09:35.558 --> 09:36.724
Now, run!

09:36.818 --> 09:37.801
(panting)

09:37.894 --> 09:39.152
Maybe it's a fire truck.

09:39.304 --> 09:40.895
Ow! Or a double-decker bus.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.747
Owie! Or a Twizzler factory.

09:42.899 --> 09:45.083
Ow! Ooh, that went in me.

09:46.402 --> 09:48.144
A bathtub?

09:48.163 --> 09:50.630
A sexy bathtub?

09:51.499 --> 09:52.907
Hmm.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.426
(gasps)

09:55.429 --> 09:57.654
"Since 1943,

09:57.656 --> 10:02.342
"Honeymoon Mountain has been
a mecca of matrimonial merriment

10:02.494 --> 10:07.439
where newlyweds do that voodoo
you do after saying 'I do.'"

10:09.926 --> 10:12.152

to jot phone numbers on!

10:24.625 --> 10:27.367
-Oh... ah...
-Oh... ah...

10:27.461 --> 10:30.353
Oh, I can feel
my front stuff again.

10:30.488 --> 10:33.614
We can turn these abandoned
snuggle shacks into shelter.

10:33.708 --> 10:35.191
And warm clothes.

10:35.284 --> 10:37.043
What the heck is that?

10:37.195 --> 10:40.121
I think it's
a champagne glass Jacuzzi.

11:17.326 --> 11:19.569
we never made it
to the Saffron Center

we're missing.

11:32.675 --> 11:34.341
Well,
on<i> Helicopter Hiker Hunters,</i>

11:34.361 --> 11:37.937
they always say:
"If you're lost, stay put,

11:38.089 --> 11:39.589

11:39.758 --> 11:42.091
That could be tomorrow
or a month from now.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.202
Oh, we've
just got to survive here

11:44.353 --> 11:46.204
until they notice we're gone.

11:46.431 --> 11:49.356
Luckily, we have
a warm shelter, water...

11:49.451 --> 11:50.934
And love.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.210
That's sweet.

Hmm...

11:57.959 --> 11:59.459
Tomorrow we'll find food.

11:59.611 --> 12:03.012

Oh, I thought I knew
what hunger was,

12:20.574 --> 12:23.408
but now I know that was
just not being full.

12:23.635 --> 12:27.653
Last week there was Cheerios
powder at the bottom of the bag,

12:27.806 --> 12:29.914
and I just threw it out.

12:29.991 --> 12:31.916
That powder sounds so good.

12:32.068 --> 12:33.734
Tell me
about the powder again...

12:33.754 --> 12:35.587
slowly.

12:48.693 --> 12:50.159
-This has to work.
-Yeah.

12:50.253 --> 12:53.271
Fish are way stupider
than rabbits or nuts.

Why don't you bite
my bait-less hook?!

13:09.105 --> 13:10.271
Oh, be careful.

13:10.365 --> 13:12.682
You'll get your shag pants wet.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.517

13:14.610 --> 13:16.610

get out of those wet clothes

13:23.695 --> 13:25.211
and get to the fire.

13:25.363 --> 13:26.954
