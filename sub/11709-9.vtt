07:03.214 --> 07:03.756
{\an8}- AW, DUDE, I THINK YOU DO IT
OVER THE PHONE, DUDE.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.800
{\an8}- HELL YEAH.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.343
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY WANNA
BREAK UP WITH PAULA,

07:07.426 --> 07:09.303
{\an8}YOU KNOW, IN A REALLY
SMOOTH AND EASY WAY

07:09.387 --> 07:11.389
{\an8}BECAUSE I'D LIKE
TO STILL HIT IT.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.808
{\an8}"LISTEN, GIRL, IT'S NOT ME.
IT'S YOU.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.270
{\an8}CAN I STILL HIT IT?"

07:17.353 --> 07:19.355
{\an8}[chuckles]

07:19.438 --> 07:20.940
{\an8}- ARE YOU PLAYING THIS?

07:21.023 --> 07:22.150
{\an8}- NAH, THIS GAME DOESN'T WORK.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.776
{\an8}THE SCORE DOESN'T KEEP.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.111
{\an8}I JUST WHUPPED HIS ASS.
IT DIDN'T KEEP TRACK.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.239
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
- WHACK.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.783
{\an8}- WHERE YOU GUYS FROM?
- TOMS RIVER.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.286
{\an8}both: RIGHT OVER THE BRIDGE.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.830
{\an8}- THIS IS MY FRIEND, MIKE.
HE'S NEWLY SINGLE.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.541
{\an8}- NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M JENNA.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.043
{\an8}- HOW DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD
BREAK UP WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.378
{\an8}- NOT IN A TEXT MESSAGE
AND NOT ON THE PHONE.

07:42.461 --> 07:44.755
{\an8}- IN MY EYES,
MIKE HAS BEEN SINGLE

07:44.839 --> 07:46.174
{\an8}SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.842
{\an8}I DON'T CARE IF HE'S HAD
A RELATIONSHIP WITH PAULA.

07:47.925 --> 07:48.759
{\an8}THAT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP,

07:48.843 --> 07:49.969
{\an8}SO ME AND PAULY
ARE ALREADY TELLING PEOPLE

07:50.052 --> 07:52.430
{\an8}THAT MIKE IS SINGLE.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.890
{\an8}- ASK HER TO GO MEET YOU
SOMEWHERE.

07:53.973 --> 07:54.891
{\an8}- AT WORK.

07:54.974 --> 07:55.725
{\an8}- NO, NOT AT WORK.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.435
{\an8}- THIS WAY,
YOU HAVE A TIME CRUNCH.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.728
{\an8}IT'LL ONLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.979
{\an8}- OH, THAT'S TRUE.
- THAT WORKS.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.231
{\an8}- VINNY AND PAULY
ARE ALREADY TELLING CHICKS

08:02.315 --> 08:03.733
{\an8}AND PEOPLE THAT I'M BREAKING UP
WITH PAULA.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.151
{\an8}LISTEN, BRAH.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.777
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
THIS IS A SMALL TOWN.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.155
{\an8}AND SOONER OR LATER,
THIS MAY GET BACK TO PAULA

08:09.238 --> 08:12.700
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T EVEN
TELL HER YET.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.578
{\an8}- NICOLE DOESN'T HANG OUT
WITH ME OR TALK TO ME.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.455
{\an8}WHEN SHE SEES ME,
SHE THINKS AUTOMATICALLY

08:17.538 --> 08:20.583
{\an8}OF HER DRINKING,
CLIMBING INTO BED WITH DUDES.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.084
{\an8}I'M THAT MEMORY.
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.003
{\an8}- HOW'S THAT FEEL?
- [laughs]

08:24.086 --> 08:24.795
{\an8}- JIONNI.
- WHAT'S UP?

08:24.879 --> 08:28.216
{\an8}- 3:00 P.M., RIVOLI'S,
BABY SHOWER.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.718
{\an8}IF YOU FUCKING TELL HER
ANY OF THIS, I WILL CUT YOU.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.058
{\an8}- ♪ YOU SAY YOU ♪

08:37.140 --> 08:40.269
{\an8}♪ YOU GOT A LOT TO LOSE ♪

08:40.352 --> 08:43.606
{\an8}♪ YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN ♪

08:43.688 --> 08:45.441
{\an8}- SO, MIKE, ARE YOU GONNA
BREAK UP WITH PAULA?

08:45.524 --> 08:46.317
{\an8}- YEAH.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.777
{\an8}- YOU MADE THAT DECISION?
- YES.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.861
{\an8}- WHERE ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.239
{\an8}- PULLING CHUTE
TEN DAYS LATER.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.281
{\an8}- AT HER--AT HER WORK.
- THAT'S AWESOME.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.785
{\an8}- I JUST CAN'T--
I CAN'T FAKE IT ANYMORE.

08:55.868 --> 08:56.786
{\an8}LIKE, SHE CHANGED,

08:56.869 --> 08:58.454
{\an8}EVER SINCE I GAVE HER
THE TITLE.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.664
{\an8}IF YOU'RE GONNA ACT
LIKE ONE OF THE BOYS,

08:59.747 --> 09:00.998
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA WANT
TO FUCK YOU NO MORE.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.083
{\an8}IT'S THE TRUTH.
- ARE YOU GONNA TELL HER THAT?

09:02.166 --> 09:05.586
{\an8}- NO.
- [laughs]

09:05.670 --> 09:07.129
{\an8}- I THINK YOU SHOULD.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.840
{\an8}- I'M GONNA BE LIKE,
"IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME."

09:09.924 --> 09:13.469
{\an8}[laughter]

09:13.552 --> 09:14.971
{\an8}- HOW CLICHE.
- YES.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.180
{\an8}YEAH, IT IS CLICHE,
BUT I'M REALLY--

09:16.264 --> 09:18.432
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA BE A DICK.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.101
{\an8}- I DON'T GET IT.
PAULA'S A LITTLE WILD,

09:20.184 --> 09:21.394
{\an8}SHE SAYS CRAZY THINGS,
AND SHE'S A LITTLE OUT THERE.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.854
{\an8}THEN YOU HAVE MIKE
WHO'S A LITTLE WILD,

09:23.938 --> 09:25.773
{\an8}SAYS CRAZY THINGS,
AND HE'S OUT THERE.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.525
{\an8}I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE
A PERFECT MATCH.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.943
{\an8}- HE'S GONNA GO
USE THE RESTROOM.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.111
{\an8}I'M GONNA GO GET A DRINK.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.655
{\an8}- SEE YOU IN A FEW.
- SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.661
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR COMING WITH ME.
- OH, NO PROBLEM.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.413
{\an8}- I APPRECIATE YOU
NOT PUTTING YOUR TWO CENTS

09:40.496 --> 09:43.332
{\an8}INTO MY RELATIONSHIP,
AND THAT'S GOOD TO SAY

09:43.416 --> 09:44.083
{\an8}BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU
DO THAT IN RELATIONSHIPS

09:44.166 --> 09:45.334
{\an8}IN THIS HOUSE.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.253
{\an8}- NO, I, UM--
[stammering]

09:47.336 --> 09:48.546
{\an8}ME AND YOU
REALLY GET ALONG.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.715
{\an8}LIKE, I LOOK OUT FOR YOU
LIKE A LITTLE SISTER.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.174
{\an8}LIKE, I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO GO NEAR YOU.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.426
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

09:53.509 --> 09:55.094
{\an8}SO I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD
ABOUT YOU,

09:55.177 --> 09:56.304
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- NO, YEAH.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.931
{\an8}BUT PAULA WILL STILL
BE YOUR FRIEND?

09:59.015 --> 10:00.433
{\an8}- YES, OF COURSE.
- GOOD.

10:00.516 --> 10:01.809
{\an8}- BECAUSE I JUST--
I JUST--

10:01.892 --> 10:03.561
{\an8}EITHER "A,"
SHE'S NOT READY FOR IT,

10:03.644 --> 10:04.770
{\an8}"B," I'M NOT READY FOR IT,

10:04.854 --> 10:05.604
{\an8}OR IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME
IN OUR LIVES

10:05.688 --> 10:07.982
{\an8}BECAUSE SHE'S ACTING WEIRD
RIGHT NOW.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.025
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.109
{\an8}- WELL, YOU KNOW HER
A LOT BETTER THAN--

10:10.192 --> 10:11.277
{\an8}- SHE WAS GREAT
FOR THREE SUMMERS.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.029
{\an8}AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU GET THE TITLE

10:13.112 --> 10:14.030
{\an8}AND YOU FUCK UP?
LIKE, THAT'S CRAZY.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.700
{\an8}- YEAH, MAYBE JUST IF YOU
FEEL COMFORTABLE, END IT,

10:17.783 --> 10:19.869
{\an8}AND KEEP IT HOW IT WAS.
- YEAH.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.203
{\an8}- I THINK MAYBE
IT'S BEST FOR MIKE

10:21.287 --> 10:23.080
{\an8}TO BREAK UP WITH PAULA

10:23.164 --> 10:24.290
{\an8}BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
HE'S NOT HAPPY

10:24.373 --> 10:25.833
{\an8}IN HIS RELATIONSHIP,

10:25.916 --> 10:28.294
{\an8}AND IT MIGHT BE BEST
FOR BOTH OF THEM.

10:28.377 --> 10:29.253
{\an8}BUT I KIND OF FEEL BAD
FOR THE GIRL.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.796
{\an8}SHE'S GONNA BE REALLY UPSET.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.089
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

10:32.173 --> 10:33.382
{\an8}LIKE, IT'S YOUR FAULT,
IT'S NOT MINE.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.383
{\an8}I KNOW I DIDN'T CHANGE.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.551
{\an8}I'M THE SAME FUCKING PERSON

10:35.634 --> 10:36.635
{\an8}YOU'VE KNOWN
FOR THREE SUMMERS.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.762
{\an8}PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT
BETTER-LOOKING,

10:37.845 --> 10:38.929
{\an8}MORE RIPPED,

10:39.013 --> 10:41.432
{\an8}AND BETTER DRESSED.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.725
{\an8}- WHEN ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH HER?

10:42.808 --> 10:45.186
{\an8}- PROBABLY TOMORROW.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.320
{\an8}- WHERE WE GOING?
THE BEACH BAR?

10:54.403 --> 10:56.238
{\an8}- YEAH.
- ARE WE GONNA WALK?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.615
{\an8}DRIVE?
- DRIVE.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.825
{\an8}- YEAH.
- DRIVE?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.703
{\an8}WHAT IF WE WANT TO DRINK?
- [chuckles]

11:02.787 --> 11:04.622
{\an8}- BUSTED.
- MIKE CAN'T DRINK.

11:04.705 --> 11:05.915
{\an8}- WELL, YEAH, I'M GONNA--
IT'S GONNA BE

11:05.998 --> 11:07.458
{\an8}A PRETTY COOL ACCOMPLISHMENT
AT THE END

11:07.541 --> 11:09.585
{\an8}WHEN I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK
OR A CIGARETTE THE WHOLE TIME.

11:09.668 --> 11:10.961
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY COOL.
- AH, HELL YEAH.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.255
{\an8}[overlapping chatter]

11:13.339 --> 11:15.841
{\an8}- MORE OF A--
MORE A CIGARETTE THAN A DRINK,

11:15.925 --> 11:16.926
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT, LIKE,
A REAL BIG DRINKER.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.552
{\an8}- NOW WE CAN CHEERS TO IT.

11:18.636 --> 11:19.512
{\an8}- YO, IT'S GONNA BE
A WHOLE 'NOTHER REHAB FOR YOU.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.723
{\an8}- YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.433
{\an8}- YOU MADE IT THROUGH THIS,
YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH ANY--

11:24.517 --> 11:25.601
{\an8}- YEAH.
- HELL YEAH.

11:25.684 --> 11:26.644
{\an8}- YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH
A RELATIONSHIP,

11:26.727 --> 11:27.186
{\an8}BUT YOU MADE IT THROUGH
THE HOUSE.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.814
{\an8}[laughter]
- WHAT?

11:29.897 --> 11:33.317
{\an8}SO CAN WE GO
TO THE BREAK-UP ALSO?

11:33.401 --> 11:34.610
{\an8}- OH, GOD.
- OH, I'M GONNA BE THERE.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.071
{\an8}THAT'S FOR SURE.
THE GUYS ARE GONNA BE THERE.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.572
{\an8}- YEAH.
- G.T.B.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.032
{\an8}"GYM, TAN,
BREAK UP WITH PAULA."

11:40.116 --> 11:41.450
{\an8}- "LET'S MAKE IT UNOFFICIAL,
GIRL."

11:41.534 --> 11:43.035
{\an8}- I GOT A TICKET ALREADY.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.329
{\an8}YO, LET'S GO.
- YO, WHO'S DRIVING?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.330

11:52.211 --> 11:53.337
{\an8}- I HAD A GOOD DAY.
- WE--ALL OF US HAD FUN.

11:53.421 --> 11:57.133
{\an8}- ♪ I CAN RECALL THE BLAME ♪

11:57.216 --> 11:59.051

{\an8}- 12.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.345
{\an8}- I'LL HAVE A DOZEN.
- OKAY.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.140
{\an8}- [laughs]

12:04.223 --> 12:06.475
{\an8}I'LL BE RIGHT BACK

12:15.484 --> 12:16.819
{\an8}- I MEANT LIKE TOAST
A FUCKING DRINK,

12:16.902 --> 12:18.446
{\an8}'CAUSE IT'S GONNA BE
A REALLY BIG DAY FOR ME.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.447
{\an8}- SO HOW DO YOU FEEL,
MY DUDE?

12:19.530 --> 12:22.324

{\an8}YOU FEEL GOOD THOUGH?

12:23.242 --> 12:23.993
{\an8}- YOU LOOK GOOD.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.286
{\an8}- PROBABLY THE BEST

12:25.369 --> 12:26.120
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

12:26.203 --> 12:27.705
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU FALL ON YOUR FACE,

12:27.788 --> 12:29.331
{\an8}YOU KIND OF MAKE A MISTAKE,
AND YOU KIND OF REMEMBER?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.000
{\an8}AND YOU LEARN FROM IT?

12:31.083 --> 12:32.293
{\an8}SO IT'S JUST, LIKE, I FEEL LIKE

12:36.589 --> 12:38.841
{\an8}I HAVE TO DEFINITELY
THANK YOU GUYS,

{\an8}I WOULDN'T BE SO COMFORTABLE,

12:41.760 --> 12:42.845
{\an8}AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO DO THIS.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.346
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M SO COMFORTABLE
AROUND YOU GUYS,

12:44.430 --> 12:45.389
{\an8}I CAN TELL YOU GUYS ANYTHING.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.474

{\an8}-<i> SALUD</i> TO THAT.
<i>SALUD.</i>

12:53.814 --> 12:55.983
{\an8}IN A LONG TIME,
SO I'M TOASTING UP.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.318
{\an8}- MIKE, HAVE YOU EVER--

12:57.401 --> 12:59.612
{\an8}ARE YOU GONNA EVER TRY
AND TALK TO NICOLE AGAIN?

12:59.695 --> 13:01.363
{\an8}- THAT'S ON THE PRIORITY LIST
SOMEWHERE.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.865
{\an8}I DO WANNA APOLOGIZE TO HER,

13:02.948 --> 13:05.784
{\an8}BUT I-I FEEL LIKE--
IT WOULD BE--

13:05.868 --> 13:07.828
{\an8}- APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT THOUGH?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

13:07.912 --> 13:09.538
{\an8}- YOU DON'T NEED TO APOLOGIZE.
YOU COULD JUST GO TALK TO HER,

13:09.622 --> 13:10.873
{\an8}MAYBE JUST SETTLE THE AIR.
- YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.082
{\an8}- YOU COULD SETTLE THE AIR.
- WELL--

13:12.166 --> 13:13.083
{\an8}- I MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT IT UP

13:13.167 --> 13:15.211
{\an8}IN THE WRONG PLACE
AND WRONG TIME.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.420
{\an8}- AND SO THAT'S ALL YOU
APOLOGIZE FOR.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.546
{\an8}THAT'S IT.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.589
{\an8}- OR YOU JUST SETTLE THE AIR

13:18.672 --> 13:19.673
{\an8}AND TRY TO TALK TO HER,
THAT'S IT.

13:19.757 --> 13:20.841
{\an8}YOU DON'T NEED TO, LIKE--

13:20.925 --> 13:21.383
{\an8}- IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER,
THE BEEF WAS OVER

13:21.467 --> 13:23.219
{\an8}WHETHER HE DID IT OR NOT.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.804
{\an8}BUT HE CLARIFIED
THAT HE DID.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.264
{\an8}JUST THE FACT
THAT HE BROUGHT IT UP

13:27.348 --> 13:28.807
{\an8}IS WHAT HE NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE,
THAT'S THE ONLY THING.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.642
{\an8}SHE'LL COME AROUND ONE DAY.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.144
{\an8}- I THINK SHE WILL COME AROUND
ONE DAY.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.896
{\an8}IF I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE
TO NICOLE,

13:33.979 --> 13:36.732
{\an8}IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THAT I
MAYBE RUINED OUR RELATIONSHIP

13:36.815 --> 13:39.318
{\an8}IN A WAY,
MAYBE BETRAYED HER TRUST.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.070
{\an8}- SHE SAID THAT YOU WOULD--
SHE WOULD LISTEN OUT

13:41.153 --> 13:42.404
{\an8}IF YOU WENT TO TALK TO HER.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.366
{\an8}- I HAD GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH HER
RELATIONSHIP WITH JIONNI,

13:45.449 --> 13:48.869
{\an8}MAYBE BROUGHT UP THINGS WHEN IT
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.913
{\an8}BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA MAN UP

13:50.996 --> 13:53.332
{\an8}WHETHER IT'S 50/50 OR 100/0.

13:53.415 --> 13:56.085
{\an8}- I JUST THINK THAT
WHENEVER SHE SEES ME OR HIM,

13:56.168 --> 14:00.089
{\an8}IT BRINGS UP A PAST OF HER THAT
SHE DOESN'T WANNA REMEMBER...

14:00.172 --> 14:02.299
{\an8}- YES.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.592
{\an8}- AND SHE CAN NEVER
GET RID OF IT.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.677
{\an8}- THAT'S WHY SHE DOESN'T
BRING JIONNI

14:04.760 --> 14:05.928
{\an8}AROUND THE HOUSE ANYMORE.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.097
{\an8}- THAT'S WHY THEY WANT
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.224
{\an8}NICOLE IS TRYING
TO FORGET HER PAST SO MUCH

14:10.307 --> 14:12.268
{\an8}BECAUSE SHE'S GONNA HAVE
A KID NOW,

14:12.351 --> 14:15.813
{\an8}AND NICOLE WANTS TO BE, LIKE,
A GOOD, CONSERVATIVE MOM.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.815
{\an8}THAT'S WHY NICOLE DOESN'T
HANG OUT WITH ME OR TALK TO ME.

14:17.898 --> 14:21.860
{\an8}WHEN SHE SEES ME, SHE THINKS
AUTOMATICALLY OF HER

14:21.944 --> 14:24.321
{\an8}DRINKING,
CLIMBING INTO BED WITH DUDES,

14:24.405 --> 14:24.905
{\an8}FUCKING A DIFFERENT GUY
EVERY NIGHT.

14:24.989 --> 14:25.531
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:25.614 --> 14:26.740
{\an8}LIKE, I'M--I'M THAT MEMORY.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.243
{\an8}- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
- HOW'S THAT FEEL?

14:29.326 --> 14:31.579
{\an8}[laughter]

14:31.662 --> 14:32.955
{\an8}- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
- I KNOW.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.373
{\an8}- IT IS WHAT IT IS.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.792
{\an8}- ME AND NICOLE ARE DEFINITELY
IN A BETTER PLACE

14:36.875 --> 14:38.168
{\an8}THAN MIKE AND NICOLE ARE.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.337
{\an8}NICOLE ACTUALLY LIKES ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

14:40.421 --> 14:40.921
{\an8}NICOLE ACTUALLY HATES MIKE.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.048
{\an8}SO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY

14:43.132 --> 14:44.174
{\an8}THAT ME AND NICOLE
WILL BE OUT OF THE WOODS

14:44.258 --> 14:47.386
{\an8}IF JIONNI DECIDES THAT HE WANTS
TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.597
{\an8}BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.431

{\an8}- NO. HE DOESN'T EXIST
IN MY WORLD.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.235
{\an8}- YOU DON'T EVEN WANT AN APOLOGY
FROM HIM, DO YOU?

16:26.318 --> 16:27.986
{\an8}- EVEN IF HE DID,
I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS

16:28.070 --> 16:29.113
{\an8}WITH HIM EVER AGAIN.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.031
{\an8}HE TOTALLY EMBARRASSED

{\an8}SHE'S GOING THROUGH IT ALONE.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.378
{\an8}AND SO I HOPE
THAT THE SHORE SHOWER

21:36.461 --> 21:39.464
{\an8}WILL SHOW NICOLE THAT WE'RE
GONNA BE PART OF IT

21:39.548 --> 21:41.675
{\an8}AND WE'RE GONNA BE PART
OF LORENZO'S LIFE TOO.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.136
{\an8}THE HARDEST PART IS TO MAKE SURE
NICOLE HAS NO IDEA.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.721
{\an8}- I CAN'T GO TO THAT THOUGH

21:45.804 --> 21:47.180
{\an8}'CAUSE THE BABY DADDY
DON'T LIKE ME.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.725
{\an8}- BUT I'M HOLDING THE PARTY
AND YOU'RE INVITED.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.226
{\an8}- OH, THANKS, JEN.
[scoffs]

21:51.309 --> 21:53.729
{\an8}- WHY NOT, LIKE,
SET HIM OFF TO THE SIDE

21:53.812 --> 21:56.231
{\an8}DURING THE BABY SHOWER

21:56.314 --> 21:58.275
{\an8}AND BE, LIKE, "YO, I DON'T
WANT ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOU.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.860
{\an8}ME AND NICOLE ARE ROOMMATES"?

21:59.943 --> 22:00.861
{\an8}- I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
WITH HIM.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.446
{\an8}- EXP--TELL HIM THAT.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.447
{\an8}- NO.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.365
{\an8}"I WANT TO BE
NOT FRIENDS WITH YOU,

22:05.449 --> 22:05.907
{\an8}BUT BE COOL WITH YOU."

22:05.991 --> 22:08.493
{\an8}- NO, 'CAUSE I DON'T CARE

22:08.577 --> 22:10.120
{\an8}IF I'M COOL WITH HIM OR NOT.

22:10.203 --> 22:13.081
{\an8}- DO IT FOR NICOLE.
YOU CARE ABOUT NICOLE.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.082

22:14.166 --> 22:16.668
{\an8}- SHE DOES. I WAS TALKING
ABOUT IT TODAY AT WORK.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.296
{\an8}SHE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TWO
TO BE, LIKE, AMICABLE,

22:19.379 --> 22:20.589
{\an8}SO SHE CAN INVITE YOU
TO THE WEDDING,

22:20.672 --> 22:22.090
{\an8}SO SHE CAN INVITE YOU
TO CERTAIN THINGS.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.884
{\an8}- IF SHE THINKS IT'S
A GOOD IDEA, I'LL DO IT.

22:23.967 --> 22:24.843
{\an8}- SHE DID.
AT WORK, SHE TOLD ME.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.763
{\an8}- IT'S JENNI TALKING,
SO YOU CAN NEVER BELIEVE

22:27.846 --> 22:28.805
{\an8}WHAT'S SHE SAYING.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.516
{\an8}IF NICOLE REALLY WANTED ME
TO MAKE UP WITH JIONNI

22:31.600 --> 22:32.726
{\an8}AND BE FRIENDS WITH HIM,

22:32.809 --> 22:34.936
{\an8}NICOLE WOULD COME UP TO ME
AND ADDRESS IT HERSELF.

22:35.020 --> 22:35.979
{\an8}NOT JENNI DOING IT
FOR NICOLE.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.106
{\an8}- IT'S NOT THAT I'M SAYING
YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG,

22:38.190 --> 22:39.483
{\an8}YOU SHOULD JUST GO UP TO HIM
AND BE LIKE,

22:39.566 --> 22:42.903
{\an8}NOT THE BIGGER MAN,
BUT BE LIKE, "HEY."

22:42.986 --> 22:43.987
{\an8}- WELL, I'M DEFINITELY
THE BIGGER MAN.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.322

22:45.405 --> 22:46.615
{\an8}HE'S NOT HALF THE MAN I AM!

22:46.698 --> 22:48.492
{\an8}- OH, YES, HE IS.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.118
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SPELL
"HORS D'OEUVRE."

22:50.202 --> 22:51.411

THIS FUCKING SERIOUSLY.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.632
{\an8}- DON'T DO IT YET.
- YO, DO IT.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.050
{\an8}- JUST DO IT RIGHT WHEN
YOU GET IN THERE.

34:54.132 --> 34:56.177

34:56.260 --> 34:58.471
{\an8}- ONE OF THE HUGE QUESTIONS
OF THE DAY

34:58.554 --> 35:01.182
{\an8}REVOLVED AROUND
WHETHER WE SHOULD TAN FIRST

35:01.265 --> 35:03.684
{\an8}OR BREAK UP
WITH PAULA FIRST,

35:03.768 --> 35:05.686
{\an8}BECAUSE IF YOU BREAK UP
WITH PAULA FIRST,

35:05.770 --> 35:07.647
{\an8}YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TAN.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.690
{\an8}AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.

{\an8}- YO, HE LEFT THE KEYS
IN THE CAR.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.160
{\an8}- SHUT THE FUCK UP.

35:21.244 --> 35:24.205
{\an8}- IT TAKES A GANG OF GUIDOS
TO BREAK UP WITH PAULA.

35:24.288 --> 35:26.707
{\an8}LIKE, MIKE HAS A WHOLE SQUAD
OF GUIDO GOONS AROUND HIM

35:26.791 --> 35:28.251
{\an8}TO BREAK UP WITH PAULA.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.212
{\an8}- I SAY YOU JUST DO IT,
RIGHT OFF THE BAT. BAM.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.464
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK THAT--
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA WORK.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.299
{\an8}WHAT UP, GUYS?

35:35.383 --> 35:37.552
{\an8}WHAT'S UP, GIRL?
- HEY.

35:37.635 --> 35:38.928
{\an8}- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

35:39.011 --> 35:40.805
{\an8}- GOOD?

35:40.888 --> 35:42.223
{\an8}WHAT'S UP?
- YOU LIKE IT?

35:42.306 --> 35:44.058
{\an8}- YEAH, IT'S NICE.
- OH, YOU LOOK PRETTY.

35:44.141 --> 35:45.017
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

35:45.101 --> 35:45.685
{\an8}- I'M NOT TANNING, PAULA.

35:45.768 --> 35:46.936
{\an8}I JUST CAME FOR THE SHOW.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.730
{\an8}TEN MINUTES AWAY
BEFORE THE BREAK-UP.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.399
{\an8}- [laughs]

35:51.482 --> 35:53.526
{\an8}- [sighs]

{\an8}- CAN'T WAIT
TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.654
{\an8}- I'M NOT EVEN TANNING TODAY.

35:56.737 --> 35:58.030
{\an8}I AM SITTING MY ASS
RIGHT ON THIS COUCH,

35:58.114 --> 36:00.741
{\an8}AND WAITING FOR THE BREAK-UP
TO HAPPEN.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.827
{\an8}I GOT CANDY READY,
A FRONT-ROW SEAT.

36:02.910 --> 36:03.911
{\an8}I WANT IT TO BE GOOD.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.747
{\an8}DID YOU WANT POPCORN
OR JUST CANDY?

36:06.831 --> 36:07.623
{\an8}- CANDY'S GOOD.
- YOU WANT A DRINK?

36:07.707 --> 36:09.083
{\an8}- I'M GOOD.
- OKAY.

36:09.166 --> 36:10.585
{\an8}- SHOULD WE USE
THE BATHROOM BEFORE?

36:10.668 --> 36:13.421
{\an8}- UM...

36:13.504 --> 36:15.339
{\an8}I'LL WAIT TILL THE END.
- ALL RIGHT.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.759
{\an8}I HOPE THIS MOVIE
DOESN'T DRAG.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.469
{\an8}- ME TOO.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.596
{\an8}LOOK, HE'S HERE
FOR THE MOVIE TOO.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.139
{\an8}- OH, SHIT.

36:23.222 --> 36:26.267
{\an8}WE SHOULD DIM THE LIGHTS.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.774
{\an8}- THE MOVIE STARTED?
- MM-HMM.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.109
{\an8}- I'M ACTUALLY AT SORT OF
A LOSS OF WORDS RIGHT NOW

36:35.192 --> 36:38.279
{\an8}BECAUSE I GOT TO MAN UP
AND DO WHAT I SAID

36:38.362 --> 36:39.739
{\an8}I WAS GONNA DO.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.490
{\an8}AM I GONNA BE SMOOTH ENOUGH

36:41.574 --> 36:43.910
{\an8}TO EXECUTE G.T.B.?

36:43.993 --> 36:46.454
{\an8}SO WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

36:46.537 --> 36:48.664
{\an8}- I'M BETTER NOW.
- YEAH?

36:48.748 --> 36:49.582
{\an8}- THIS MOVIE
JUST GOT INTERESTING.

36:49.665 --> 36:51.918
{\an8}- SORRY I GOT
A LITTLE EMOTIONAL BEFORE.

36:52.001 --> 36:52.877
{\an8}- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

36:52.960 --> 36:53.920
{\an8}I MEAN, IT IS WHAT IT IS.

36:54.003 --> 36:54.921
{\an8}I MEAN, UM,

36:55.004 --> 36:56.964
{\an8}I MEAN, TODAY--
TODAY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,

36:57.048 --> 36:59.091
{\an8}BUT IT'S, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT THE--YOU KNOW,

36:59.175 --> 36:59.800
{\an8}IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD,
YOU KNOW?

36:59.884 --> 37:03.679
{\an8}YOU KNOW I CARE ABOUT YOU.

37:03.763 --> 37:06.307
{\an8}- I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO.
- I KNOW.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.475
{\an8}- YO, IF IT'S LIKE THIS
THE WHOLE TIME,

37:07.558 --> 37:08.935
{\an8}I'M GONNA ASK
FOR MY MONEY BACK.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.603
{\an8}- I MEAN, MAYBE WE'RE JUST
MOVING A LITTLE TOO QUICK,

37:10.686 --> 37:12.647
{\an8}AND IF YOU ASK ME,
IF WE COULD GO BACK

37:12.730 --> 37:14.649
{\an8}TO THE WAY WE WERE
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

37:14.732 --> 37:15.733
{\an8}'CAUSE THAT WORKED FOR ME,

37:15.816 --> 37:17.485
{\an8}AND THEN WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM THERE.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.528
{\an8}- I JUST DON'T WANT
TO GET FUCKED OVER.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.780
{\an8}- I WOULD NEVER
FUCK YOU OVER THOUGH.

37:20.863 --> 37:21.864
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOU KNOW THAT.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.825
{\an8}WHETHER WE'RE GOING OUT NOW,
OR WE'RE GOING OUT LATER,

37:24.909 --> 37:26.494
{\an8}OR TOMORROW,
OR A MONTH FROM NOW,

37:26.577 --> 37:27.787
{\an8}YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE
IN MY LIFE.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.163
{\an8}BUT JUST MAYBE
RIGHT THIS SECOND,

37:29.246 --> 37:30.831
{\an8}IT'S JUST MAYBE
NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

37:30.915 --> 37:31.874
{\an8}AND IF WE COULD GO BACK
TO THE WAY WE WERE,

37:31.958 --> 37:34.794
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
FOR A LITTLE BIT...

37:34.877 --> 37:37.797
{\an8}- YOU'LL FIND THAT SPARK
THAT YOU LIKED ABOUT ME SO MUCH?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.924
{\an8}- I ALWAYS LIKE YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.300
{\an8}YOU KNOW THAT.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.219
{\an8}NO MATTER IF YOU'RE CRAZY PAULA,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.346
{\an8}I'M ALWAYS GONNA CARE ABOUT YOU.
YOU KNOW THAT.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.806
{\an8}- YOU'RE FAIR GAME NOW.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.599
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL?
"FAIR GAME NOW"?

37:48.683 --> 37:49.350
{\an8}SO, LIKE, PAULA'S,
LIKE, COOL WITH IT,

37:49.433 --> 37:50.351
{\an8}AND, LIKE,
MIKE'S COOL WITH IT.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.770
{\an8}AND THEN MIKE KISSES HER
ON THE LIPS AND THAT'S IT.

37:52.853 --> 37:54.397
{\an8}THIS MOVIE SUCKS.
I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.773
{\an8}- CAN I GET A HUG?

37:55.856 --> 37:57.525
{\an8}- I GUESS SO.

37:57.608 --> 38:01.195
{\an8}- ARE YOU SURE,
BROWN EYES?

38:01.278 --> 38:03.447
{\an8}- DON'T START KISSING MY ASS.
YOU JUST DUMPED ME.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.032
{\an8}- I DID NOT.
- [laughs]

38:05.116 --> 38:06.325
{\an8}- I DID NOT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:06.409 --> 38:10.955
{\an8}WE HAD, LIKE, A--
LIKE, A WEEK.

38:11.038 --> 38:11.872
{\an8}- IT'S STILL NOT
MY SHORTEST RELATIONSHIP.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.541
{\an8}- OH, THANKS.
- [laughs]

38:13.624 --> 38:15.626
{\an8}- CRAZY GIRL.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.711
{\an8}- ME AND SAM BREAK UP,

38:16.794 --> 38:18.295
{\an8}THAT SHIT'S
LIKE GOING TO, LIKE,

38:18.379 --> 38:19.422
{\an8}A HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.506
{\an8}LIKE, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

38:20.589 --> 38:21.632
{\an8}YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA SEE ACTION.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.801
{\an8}WITH MIKE
AND PAULA'S BREAK-UP,

38:23.884 --> 38:24.635
{\an8}I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING
A CHICKEN FIGHT.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.971
{\an8}THERE WAS JUST, LIKE,
PECKS GOING ON

38:27.054 --> 38:29.390
{\an8}'CAUSE ALL THEY WOULD DO
IS KISS THE WHOLE TIME.

38:29.473 --> 38:30.516
{\an8}- SEE YOU LATER.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.476
{\an8}- BYE.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.228
{\an8}- CAN WE GO?
- YEAH.

38:34.311 --> 38:35.980
{\an8}- YEAH?
- YEAH.

38:36.063 --> 38:38.107
{\an8}- SEE YOU TONIGHT, PAULA.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.611
{\an8}WAS THAT EVEN A BREAK-UP?
- WHAT?

38:42.695 --> 38:45.906
{\an8}- I JUST SAW YOU MAKE OUT
WITH HER, LIKE, TEN TIMES.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.450
{\an8}- DUDE,
I'VE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE

38:47.533 --> 38:48.951
{\an8}MAKE OUT
WHEN THEY BREAK UP.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.119
{\an8}- I'M VERY GOOD WHEN IT COMES
TO SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.495
{\an8}- YO, BREAKING UP
IS HARD TO DO, BRO.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.956
{\an8}- EXACTLY.

38:54.040 --> 38:54.999
{\an8}- WHOA, WHAT DID I MISS?

38:55.082 --> 38:57.293
{\an8}- NOT MUCH.
- NOTHING GOOD.

38:57.376 --> 38:59.253
{\an8}- YOU WERE HOPING--
- THEY HUGGED, THEY KISSED.

38:59.336 --> 39:00.296
{\an8}HE SAID,
"I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT."

39:00.379 --> 39:02.048
{\an8}- YEAH.
[laughter]

39:02.131 --> 39:03.507
{\an8}- HE DID DUMP HER THOUGH.
HE DID DUMP HER THOUGH.

39:03.591 --> 39:04.175
{\an8}- I DID DUMP HER THOUGH.
- 'CAUSE SHE EVEN SAID IT.

39:04.258 --> 39:06.093
{\an8}SHE'S LIKE,
"YOU DUMPED ME."

39:06.177 --> 39:07.928
{\an8}- WOW, THAT WAS, LIKE,
THE CORNIEST,

39:08.012 --> 39:09.055
{\an8}EASIEST BREAK-UP
I'VE EVER SEEN.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.556
{\an8}- I'M GLAD IT'S OVER.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.725
{\an8}WE DON'T HAVE
TO HEAR HER NAME EVER AGAIN.
