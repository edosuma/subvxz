00:41.200 --> 00:44.500
(tranquil music playing)

01:04.033 --> 01:05.633
Oh, my gosh.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.533
It's only one week
till spring break.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.200
I have so much to do--

01:11.266 --> 01:16.100
I have to get new t-shirts
for the wet t-shirt contest...

01:16.166 --> 01:20.033
I'm actually looking forward
to spring break this year.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.433
College kids.
America's best and brightest

01:22.500 --> 01:23.667
are coming to town.

01:23.734 --> 01:25.734
It'll be nice to get mooned again.

01:27.233 --> 01:29.200
It's more than that, Ma.

01:29.266 --> 01:31.000
I'm talking about
my school's project

01:31.066 --> 01:33.967
to get kids to read
during spring vacation.

01:34.033 --> 01:38.033
We're putting on plays
based on children's stories.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.266
And guess what.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.433
I've just been made producer

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
of the first grade production.

01:43.567 --> 01:45.033
This is all you have,

01:45.100 --> 01:46.834
so I'll be happy for you.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.066
I'm really excited about this.

01:50.133 --> 01:51.266
We're doing <i>Henny Penny.</i>

01:51.333 --> 01:54.400
You know-- "Help, help,
the sky is falling."

01:54.467 --> 01:57.567
That's not my favorite.
There's no prince in it.

01:57.633 --> 02:00.633
I like a fairy tale
with a prince in it,

02:00.700 --> 02:03.200
a handsome prince
with a big old codpiece

02:03.266 --> 02:05.433
and deep, dark eyes...

02:06.767 --> 02:10.633
powerful thighs and muscles rippling
beneath his tunic.

02:10.700 --> 02:15.000
Blanche, you could get aroused
by Humpty Dumpty.

02:15.066 --> 02:17.033
Are you kidding?

02:17.100 --> 02:20.166
All the king's horses
and all the king's men?

02:20.233 --> 02:22.667
Handsome men with deep, dark eyes

02:22.734 --> 02:24.367
and powerful thighs

02:24.433 --> 02:28.433
and muscles and big old codpieces.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.500
How do you make it through an omelet?

02:33.100 --> 02:35.433
78, yes.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.900
64, yes.

02:37.967 --> 02:39.133
81, yes!

02:39.200 --> 02:41.266
-What are you doing?
-Checking the obituaries

02:41.333 --> 02:44.066
for people younger than I am.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.767
83. Close one.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.166
-68.
-Whoa.

02:50.233 --> 02:51.867
-What is it?
-You!

02:51.934 --> 02:54.600
-What about me?
-You're dead.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.333
Say what?

02:56.400 --> 02:59.066
You must be dead. It's in the paper.

02:59.133 --> 03:02.266
"Blanche Devereaux, age 68--"

03:02.333 --> 03:04.300
68!

03:04.367 --> 03:05.800
That's terrible.

03:05.867 --> 03:09.967
They're almost as far off on your age
as you are.

03:10.033 --> 03:12.967
I wonder how this could have happened.

03:13.033 --> 03:15.700
I know how, because I know
who took that picture--

03:15.767 --> 03:18.467
Chugger Deitz, the obituary editor.

03:18.533 --> 03:21.967
I never dreamed when I dropped him
he'd be so vindictive.

03:22.033 --> 03:25.433
68! Can you believe that? 68!

03:25.500 --> 03:28.433
And dead. Don't forget dead.

03:29.333 --> 03:32.266
I'm going down to that
newspaper this minute.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.233
Besides getting Chugger fired,

03:34.300 --> 03:37.800
I'll get a retraction
in this afternoon's edition.

03:37.867 --> 03:38.967
68.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.400
And dead.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.600
What are people going to think?

03:43.667 --> 03:46.166
They'll think it's time to elect
a new town slut.

03:47.266 --> 03:49.600
Oh.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.600
Mail call.

04:01.667 --> 04:05.266
Ah, Ma, here's a letter
for you from Palermo.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.433
It's the latest chess move

04:08.500 --> 04:11.266
from my old rival Sarafina Gambrazi.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.333
How long has this chess game
gone on?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.166
It must be 10 years now.

04:16.233 --> 04:19.433
It'll continue until I beat Sarafina
at something.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.633
What are you talking about?

04:20.700 --> 04:23.834
Picture it: Sicily, 1920,

04:23.900 --> 04:27.800
Sarafina and I were both crazy
about Marco the goat boy.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.066
In appearance an Adonis,
in behavior

04:32.133 --> 04:34.266
horny as a toad.

04:36.734 --> 04:40.433
Little did I know he had a thing
for hairy fat girls.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.200
If I were fatter and hairier, Dorothy,

04:44.266 --> 04:46.166
Marco the goat boy

04:46.233 --> 04:48.000
could have been your father.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.433
I think we all grieve.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.467
Ma, that was 70 years ago
I was sure you'd forgotten.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.667
I forget nothing.

04:58.734 --> 05:00.433
So, any mail?

05:03.200 --> 05:05.533
(doorbell rings)

05:08.900 --> 05:10.834
Oh, Frank. Come on in.

05:10.900 --> 05:13.333
Ma, Frank Nann. Frank, my mother.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.333
Hello, Frank.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.000
Ma, Frank is directing

05:16.066 --> 05:17.600
the production of <i>Henny Penny.</i>

05:17.667 --> 05:20.967
Not anymore.
One kid's got the measles.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.767
Because the audience is children, too,
the entire cast has been quarantined.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.367
What do we do?

05:27.433 --> 05:28.500
Cancel.

05:28.567 --> 05:30.166
We can't cancel.

05:30.233 --> 05:33.166
First grade is when kids
get interested in reading.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.867
Why can't we recast it
with adults?

05:35.934 --> 05:38.934
Where's an adult with
the childlike naivete

05:39.000 --> 05:40.300
to play Henny Penny?

05:46.100 --> 05:49.000
Oh. You won't believe it.

05:49.066 --> 05:52.500
I just saw a cloud that looked
exactly like a cotton ball.

05:54.066 --> 05:57.133
My God, she is Henny Penny.

05:57.867 --> 05:59.266
I beg your pardon?

05:59.333 --> 06:02.300
Um, Frank Nann,
Rose Nylund.

06:02.367 --> 06:05.400
Rose, my entire cast
has been quarantined.

06:05.467 --> 06:06.800
We're in a real bind.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.433
Would you like to play Henny Penny?

06:09.500 --> 06:13.400
Well, I have enjoyed
playing a hen in the past.

06:13.467 --> 06:15.066
Fill us in--

06:15.133 --> 06:17.800
parade, honeymoon,
or religious ceremony?

06:17.867 --> 06:21.967
Theater. The St. Olaf masquers'
production of <i>Hamlet.</i>

06:22.033 --> 06:25.667
I don't right off recall a hen in <i>Hamlet.</i>

06:25.734 --> 06:28.567
We set the play in a barnyard.

06:28.633 --> 06:32.033
Luckily, the symphony
was out of town.

06:34.967 --> 06:38.033
Can I take it you'll
play Henny Penny?

06:38.100 --> 06:39.967
I'm your chicken.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.433
Great. I'll set the oven for 425.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.567
Well, Frank Nann.

06:50.633 --> 06:53.900
I haven't seen you since
that weekend in Pensacola.

06:53.967 --> 06:56.166
Goosey Lucy.

06:58.233 --> 07:02.667
That's right. We did have fun,
Squeezy Wheezy.

07:02.734 --> 07:05.800
You're perfect for the part
of Goosey Lucy.

07:05.867 --> 07:08.467
We've had to recast <i>Henny Penny.</i>

07:08.533 --> 07:10.133
I'm playing Henny.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.266
Oh, and Frank's directing?

07:12.333 --> 07:15.033
Oh, what fun.
I would love to.

07:15.100 --> 07:20.133
Wonderful. We just have to order costumes
and change a few lines

07:20.200 --> 07:23.200
so it makes sense you two are playing
those characters.

07:23.266 --> 07:27.033
Since both of your housemates
will be in the play,

07:27.100 --> 07:29.333
you should play Turkey Lurkey.

07:30.567 --> 07:31.934
Oh, no, no, no.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.934
That's out of the question.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.834
Why? You'd be perfect.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.300
Turkey Lurkey was your nickname
in high school.

07:38.367 --> 07:39.700
Ma, it was not.

07:39.767 --> 07:43.033
Really? That's what
they called you at the PTA.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.867
Come on, Dorothy. It'll be fun.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.967
Come on, be a trouper.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.633
Well, I did once do

07:51.700 --> 07:54.567
a production of <i>Show Boat</i>
in high school,

07:54.633 --> 07:56.800
and everyone said I was pretty good.

07:56.867 --> 08:01.500
No one can sing <i>Old Man River</i>
like my Dorothy.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.934
Then you'll do it?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.100
Well, it is my production,

08:07.166 --> 08:10.233
and as they say,
the show must go on.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.700
It'll be like the old days.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.567
Come on,
just one more time.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.367
<i>♪ Get a little drunk ♪</i>

08:17.433 --> 08:19.000
<i>♪ And you land ♪</i>

08:19.066 --> 08:24.200
<i>♪ In jail ♪</i>

08:27.567 --> 08:29.600
I still got it.

08:32.767 --> 08:36.066
Yes! I've got her where I want her.

08:36.133 --> 08:40.266
My queen's knight attacks
her king. Banzai!

08:40.333 --> 08:42.433
How did two Sicilian peasant girls

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
ever become interested in chess?

08:44.567 --> 08:47.000
Chess is like war, only cheaper.

08:47.066 --> 08:48.233
The perfect game for Sicily,

08:48.300 --> 08:51.967
a country very warlike
and dead-ass broke.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.867
Well, they printed the retraction.

08:56.934 --> 08:58.867
Let me see it.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.233
I can't find it.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.500
Of course you can't.

09:04.567 --> 09:08.233
It's way down at the bottom
in itty bitty type.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.233
"Our ad in yesterday's paper

09:10.300 --> 09:12.700
should have read
Sitwell cortisone salve

09:12.767 --> 09:16.000
prevents hemorrhoids,
not presents hemorrhoids."

09:18.000 --> 09:19.433
Below that.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.433
Nobody's ever
going to see it.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.934
Everybody's going to
still think I'm 68.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.533
And dead. Why does she
keep forgetting dead?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.300
This is horrible.

09:29.367 --> 09:30.834
As big daddy used to say,

09:30.900 --> 09:33.967
"I'm feeling lower than the rent
on a burning building."

09:35.066 --> 09:38.400
That's funny. I used to live
in a burning building.

09:40.066 --> 09:42.367
And it was cheap.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.000
It was Charlie's
and my first house.

09:46.066 --> 09:48.033
Well, scoff if you must,

09:48.100 --> 09:51.033
but it was warm and toasty.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.100
I'll never forget Charlie

09:54.166 --> 09:55.567
throwing me over his shoulder

09:55.633 --> 09:58.033
and dashing across the threshold.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.166
It was a beautiful place.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.967
Three bedrooms, two baths,

10:03.033 --> 10:05.967
then two bedrooms, one bath...

10:09.033 --> 10:11.900
eventually, we outgrew the place.

10:15.633 --> 10:16.800
Rose, come on.

10:16.867 --> 10:20.033
You haven't said a word
since we left rehearsal.

10:20.100 --> 10:24.066
Nobody told me <i>Henny Penny</i>
ended that way.

10:24.133 --> 10:27.233
Nobody told me it was a tragedy.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.734
You've been rehearsing
for three days.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.367
Why make a scene now?

10:31.433 --> 10:33.667
That was the first time
we rehearsed the ending.

10:33.734 --> 10:37.367
I didn't know that turkey and henny
and goosey

10:37.433 --> 10:40.000
were all eaten by Foxy Loxy.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.400
Oh, the humanity.

10:43.467 --> 10:48.066
You didn't look at the end of the play
until today?

10:48.133 --> 10:50.834
There's one thing I remember
about my wedding night--

10:50.900 --> 10:53.667
Charlie telling me
it's impolite to peek.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.900
Rose, the play isn't real.

10:56.967 --> 10:58.633
It's a fairy tale.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.633
Not all stories end happily,

11:00.700 --> 11:02.834
and children have to learn that.

11:02.900 --> 11:04.934
You call yourself a teacher?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.967
It's people like you
who are responsible

11:07.033 --> 11:09.467
for all the evil on this planet.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.800
I guess I had that coming.

11:12.867 --> 11:15.934
I won't stand by and see
innocent children

11:16.000 --> 11:20.033
exposed to that horror story
of unprovoked violence

11:20.100 --> 11:22.166
and ghastly death.

11:22.233 --> 11:25.233
Rose, the play goes on
in two days.

11:25.300 --> 11:26.800
I can't do this.

11:26.867 --> 11:30.066
You'll just have to get yourself
another Henny Penny.

11:32.133 --> 11:34.500
(gloomy music playing)

11:35.467 --> 11:37.500
(tranquil music playing)

11:41.133 --> 11:44.633
There's no reason to be
upset about <i>Henny Penny.</i>

11:44.700 --> 11:46.767
Fairy tales just show kids

11:46.834 --> 11:48.567
how complicated
life can be,

11:48.633 --> 11:50.400
doing it on their terms.

11:50.467 --> 11:53.633
When I first read
<i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,</i>

11:53.700 --> 11:56.300
it had a profound influence on me.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.600
Seven lonely men...

12:02.700 --> 12:05.333
living in the woods,
needing a woman,

12:05.400 --> 12:09.567
all of them with napoleon complexes,
something to prove.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.767
And jobs. They all had jobs.

12:11.834 --> 12:14.100
In a diamond mine.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.333
All I'm saying is,

12:16.400 --> 12:19.967
we had fairy tales in St. Olaf
that weren't violent,

12:20.033 --> 12:22.734
and they had positive role models,

12:22.800 --> 12:25.300
like <i>Gus and the Recliner...</i>

12:28.033 --> 12:30.767
<i>Gunilla Gets a Catalog...</i>

12:32.166 --> 12:36.600
and <i>Ilsa, The Girl Who Could Make</i>
<i>Bad Food Good.</i>

12:36.667 --> 12:40.133
If you don't do the part,
there won't be any play.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.100
This is a project
I care about deeply,

12:43.166 --> 12:45.600
but don't do it for my sake.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.467
Do it for the kids.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.033
It's a chance
to get them reading.

12:51.734 --> 12:54.100
All right, I'll do it,

12:54.166 --> 12:56.000
and not just for the kids.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.967
It's time I gave
something back

12:58.033 --> 13:00.066
to the chicken community.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.000
After all, a chicken
once saved my life.

13:08.767 --> 13:12.166
They are the stupidest birds.

13:18.934 --> 13:20.767
-Any mail for me?
-Mm, no.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.600
No condolence cards?

13:25.667 --> 13:27.834
Well, where's the outpouring
of grief

13:27.900 --> 13:30.100
from all the many,
many men who's lives

13:30.166 --> 13:33.166
I have left barren and empty?

13:33.233 --> 13:36.967
Maybe they just don't know you
by your real name.

13:38.767 --> 13:41.467
Well, here it is.
Sarafina's next chess move.

13:41.533 --> 13:44.000
Perfect, I already know
my next move.

13:44.066 --> 13:47.133
And when Sarafina sees it
her hair will fall out.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.633
Her heart will stop.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.433
Her eyes will burn
like a thousand red hot suns.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.066
(cackles)

13:53.133 --> 13:56.767
Ma, why do you keep playing this
game if you hate her so much?

13:56.834 --> 13:59.200
To relax.

13:59.266 --> 14:01.200
(doorbell rings)

14:05.567 --> 14:07.600
Flowers for Blanche Deverox.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.867
That's Devereaux.

14:09.934 --> 14:12.667
It's only pronounced "Deverox"
in limericks.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.400
Well, Blanche, here you are.

14:19.467 --> 14:22.900
You say nobody cares?
What do you say now?

14:22.967 --> 14:25.734
Oh, from Mel Bushman.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.066
Good old Mel,

14:27.133 --> 14:30.066
the only person
I can always count on.

14:31.433 --> 14:33.500
"Dear blanche,
when I heard of your death,

14:33.567 --> 14:38.900
I realized you don't know
what you have till you've lost it.

14:38.967 --> 14:42.166
So I'm back with my ex-wife. Love, Mel."

14:44.867 --> 14:48.667
Now, that is the most insensitive thing
I have ever heard.

14:48.734 --> 14:53.934
"P.S. Sorry I missed your birthday.
Happy 68th."

14:56.600 --> 14:58.133
It doesn't say that.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.867
I know. I made that part up.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.700
Why are you always trying to
aggravate everyone?

15:03.767 --> 15:05.467
To relax.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.333
(bouncy piano music plays)

15:12.400 --> 15:14.066
(children cheer)

15:26.533 --> 15:28.100
"Once upon a time

15:28.166 --> 15:31.433
on a beautiful spring day,

15:31.500 --> 15:34.433
Henny Penny was waking up from a nap

15:34.500 --> 15:36.000
under an oak tree

15:36.066 --> 15:40.266
when an acorn fell
and hit her on the head."

15:42.633 --> 15:45.133
In Sicily, when they told this story,

15:45.200 --> 15:48.300
it was a safe
that fell on her head.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.200
"Anyway, Henny Penny,
being a chicken,

15:52.266 --> 15:55.166
not the brightest bird
in the world,

15:55.233 --> 15:57.467
immediately jumped
to the wrong conclusion."

16:23.600 --> 16:25.567
(Sophia) "And off she went...

16:36.900 --> 16:39.500
The most popular.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.967
about how to be that popular...safely.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.100
Well, Henny Penny.

Honey, where are you
rushing off to?

16:50.700 --> 16:53.166

I'm warning the king.

16:53.233 --> 16:54.500

16:54.567 --> 16:57.934
Yes. I don't need
to get hit in the head

16:58.000 --> 16:59.300
to get the message.

16:59.367 --> 17:03.166
In this case,
it did hit me in the head.

something hit her head?

18:44.633 --> 18:47.367
Stop and smell the flowers.

18:47.433 --> 18:49.767
We can't. The sky is falling!

Yes, through my den.

and not have us eaten

let's get it over with.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.967
Let's go. Come on.

21:17.033 --> 21:18.467
Fine, but you should know

21:18.533 --> 21:21.367
there are monsters

Uh-oh.

opponent anymore.

21:34.834 --> 21:36.667
I just got her next chess move.

21:36.734 --> 21:39.200
She bid four spades.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.834
Well, the reviews are finally in,

21:46.900 --> 21:48.834
and according to
the elementary school paper,

21:48.900 --> 21:51.266
the show was a big hit.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.800
They have their own newspaper?
How cute.

21:53.867 --> 21:55.800
Read it, Dorothy.

21:55.867 --> 21:57.800
"I saw the play yesterday.

21:57.867 --> 21:59.266
It was good.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.266
It was called <i>Henny Penny.</i>

22:01.333 --> 22:05.133
The actors were good,
especially Turkey Lurkey.

22:07.767 --> 22:09.700
And the others were good, too.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.834
My friends and I liked it."

22:11.900 --> 22:14.633
I knew my ending
wouldn't hurt the play.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.200
The show was a big success.

22:17.266 --> 22:19.900
The library's been busier than ever.

22:19.967 --> 22:23.100
The kids are really
getting excited about reading.

22:23.166 --> 22:26.033
Where's blanche?
She should see this review.

22:26.100 --> 22:29.400
I hope it makes her feel better.
I've been worried about her.

22:29.467 --> 22:32.000
Ever since she got those flowers
from Mel Bushman,

22:32.066 --> 22:33.567
she hasn't been herself.

22:33.633 --> 22:36.767
Well, I'm off to the rusty anchor.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.567
Spring break comes but once a year.
