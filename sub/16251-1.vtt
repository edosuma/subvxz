01:14.616 --> 01:16.118
Hey, babe.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.328
What is it?

01:19.246 --> 01:22.375
The cabin I used to go to
when I was the kids' age.

01:24.126 --> 01:27.096
We should take them there,
give them their first white Christmas.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.889
- You think it's still there?
- Yeah.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.887
Place was built
like a brick you-know-what.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.343
Shit house?

01:32.551 --> 01:34.178
Why, when I say you-know-what...

01:34.386 --> 01:36.388
...you feel compelled
to fill in the blanks?

01:36.597 --> 01:40.352
- Because I know it makes you crazy.
- Yes, it makes me crazy.

01:40.559 --> 01:43.608
Looks inviting.
I'm gonna need contact with my patients.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.861
It's in the middle of nowhere.
And that's what makes it great.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.615
Besides, you could use some contact
with your kids.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.870
That's the third time you've made
a crack like that in the last few weeks.

01:55.073 --> 01:59.044
- Just making sure that you heard me.
- Sweetheart, I'm not 12.

01:59.244 --> 02:03.249
You know, I get it.
It's just... I try, but work is insane.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.757
I've got all those new patients.
And I just...

02:09.630 --> 02:11.007
I know.

02:11.757 --> 02:15.557
Look, kids are your strong suit,
mine's paying the bills.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.139
That's the plan.
That was always the plan. Remember?

02:18.347 --> 02:20.896
You're better at that.
You're better at everything.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.103
- You're better at playing baseball.
- That's crap.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.489
Besides, taking care of the kids...

02:27.689 --> 02:31.910
...takes a lot less energy and time
than you think it does.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.112
You make it look easy.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.469
Here it is, guys.

05:00.634 --> 05:04.480
- It doesn't even look open.
- Yeah? Well, it's supposed to be.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.983
Okay, 9'~lY5...

05:13.188 --> 05:17.238
- I'm just gonna get the keys to the cabin.
- Dad, it's spooky out here.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.413
- I think it's kind of cool.
- Yeah, it is kind of cool.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.748
And kind of spooky.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.538
Wait here.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.264
Hello?

05:41.591 --> 05:42.638
Mr. Howes?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.058
Hello?

05:47.681 --> 05:48.807
Hello?

05:49.432 --> 05:52.106
- What do you want?
- God, man.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.530
- You scared the hell out of me.
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.694
- Are you Mr. Howes?
- Sheriff Howes, actually.

06:01.319 --> 06:05.074
Oh, I'm Terrance Shade.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.534
Leah Tyler's husband.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.797
It's nice to finally meet you.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.717
I was so sorry to hear about your loss.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.046
I remember her.
She was just the sweetest little child.

06:19.254 --> 06:22.633
My wife and I both loved her very much.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.098
- May God rest them both.
- Thank you.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.227
I was expecting you earlier.
I thought I had my days mixed up.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.810
I know. Sorry. Took me longer
than I thought to get the kids organized.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.238
Not a problem.
I got the keys to the cabin inside.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.277
Well, come on.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.160
Well, here's the cabin keys.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.742
I closed the station early
because there wasn't much going on.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.297
That's some cough you got.
You okay?

06:54.497 --> 06:57.592
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just getting over a little thing.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.839
- Everything's ready?
- I got everything you wanted.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.549
Enough for a week, easy.

07:03.757 --> 07:08.854
Lots of ice, mac and cheese,
candy, decorations.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.523
The fridge upstairs is on the fritz...

07:11.723 --> 07:14.442
...but the freezer down in the basement
is stocked full.

07:14.643 --> 07:18.068
- Great.
- It's beautiful up there.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.281
Your kids are gonna have fun.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.234
Just like their mom did.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.037
Yeah, she really lit up
when she talked about this place.

07:26.237 --> 07:30.413
She used to run up and down
those aisles looking for candy.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.042
I can see her in those two.

07:35.664 --> 07:40.591
Come on, you guys.
You got plenty. Let's go. Jake.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.598
He)'...

07:46.341 --> 07:47.934
Well, now.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.308
- What's this guy's name?
- Jack the Ripper.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.772
- Sweet.
- Thanks. Appreciate it.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.604
Oh, no. It's free candy day.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.820
You're in luck. It's free candy day.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.493
- Supposed to snow like hell.
- Snow, huh?

08:05.694 --> 08:08.197
That's good for snowmen
and all that good snow stuff.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.407
- Absolutely essential.
- Come on, you guys.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.455
- Thanks, Mr. Howes.
- Thank you.

08:13.660 --> 08:17.130
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas. Thanks, sheriff.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.468
Dad?

09:04.794 --> 09:07.764
How come you don't have
any pictures of Mom?

09:09.340 --> 09:10.387
Sure I do.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.344
Where? I never see them.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.892
Don't you think about her any more?

09:20.810 --> 09:23.689
Sweetheart, I will always
think about your mom.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.910
Sometimes it's hard
for people to keep things...

09:33.114 --> 09:38.291
...that remind them
of someone who's gone.

09:38.745 --> 09:43.296
Sometimes, they just wanna make it
through the day without feeling sad.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.377
You know what I mean?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.547
When you say "people,"
you mean you, right?

09:51.716 --> 09:54.219
Yeah. I mean me.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.483
I worry about forgetting.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.483
- Mom had such a great face.
- Sweetheart, you won't.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.939
I guarantee it.

10:12.737 --> 10:16.162
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.913
Shit!

10:19.828 --> 10:21.796
Dad said the S-H word.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.043
You guys okay?

10:23.248 --> 10:25.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.430
Stay here.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.907
Wonderful.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.482
- Dad!
- What? Are you all right?

12:04.682 --> 12:07.231
I'm all right. Are you all right?

12:11.356 --> 12:12.858
Fine.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.487
What was it?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.823
Just a squirrel.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.237
- That couldn't have been a squirrel.
- No shit.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.689
Watch your mouth, Jake.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.195
- You said it, Dad.
- Yeah, I was wrong to say it.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.697
But you say it all the time.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.824
- Jake, let it go.
- Jake, let it go.

13:08.413 --> 13:11.462
When I'm a grown up can I say bad stuff?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.090
Sure, buddy.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.116
Hey, guys.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.421
So, what do you think?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.714
- No satellite dish?
- I didn't ask.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.720
- What about cartoons?
- Guys, we're gonna hike.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.677
We're gonna sled.
We're gonna learn to ski.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.809
Have you ever done any of that stuff, Dad?

14:07.013 --> 14:09.732
- No I have not, but...
- They had better have a TV.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.481
It's called the great outdoors. All right?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.564
We're not gonna spend
that much time inside the cabin.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.705
You might be right, Dad.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.251
Maybe we don't wanna spend
much time in the cabin.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.581
Go in, Jake.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.839
Ladies first. Right, Dad?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.466
Come on. We'll all go in together.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.846
Cool. Dad, do you think it's real?

14:47.553 --> 14:50.022
Oh, no. I doubt it, honey.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.191
Totally real.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.663
Dad?

15:13.037 --> 15:15.039
What's in the box?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.292
I'm guessing tools.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.428
Mr. Howes must've left them
when he came to set everything up.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.846
- Set what up?
- Set what up?

15:23.047 --> 15:25.516
Well, that's funny you should ask.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.648
Merry Christmas, kiddos.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.113
Are there presents?

15:43.317 --> 15:46.196
Are there presents?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.748
Gee, I hadn't thought of that.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.835
- No way!
- Thanks, Dad.

15:53.911 --> 15:54.958
Got more at home too.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.086
Figured this was enough to hold you over.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.042
- Can we open them?
- No.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.094
We gotta make a fire,
gotta make hot chocolate...

16:02.295 --> 16:04.718
...get in the whole
Christmas mood, right?

16:04.922 --> 16:06.219
Come on, let's look around.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.225
Bedrooms are upstairs.
Three of them, supposedly.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.228
You guys pick the one you want.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.560
- No fighting.
- Oldest picks first.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.144
Okay, then I'll pick.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.571
All right, we'll pick.
No fighting. I promise.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.775
Excellent. I get the biggest bedroom
and my own bathroom...

16:23.983 --> 16:27.658
...because I am, obviously, the mostest
awesomest dad on the planet.

16:27.862 --> 16:31.912
Yeah? Right? Nothing? All right.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.084
Stay with the tour.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.506
Dining room.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.424
Nice.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.841
You brought your tuxedo, right?
A gentleman dresses for dinner.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.139
And this is the kitchen.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.601
Oh, man.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.432
- What are we gonna eat?
- Oh, right.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.643
The fridge is on the fritz.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.648
Follow me.

17:21.332 --> 17:25.508
- I'm not that hungry, Dad.
- Come on, you fraidycats.

17:43.604 --> 17:47.404
Behold a treasure chest
of culinary delights.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.201
A what?

17:53.573 --> 17:56.747
For the master of the house,
of course, hot dogs.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.751
For the lady, it looks like
every mini-pizza in North America.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.081
What about you, Dad?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.130
Mac and cheese.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.962
You realize you're the only kids...

18:08.170 --> 18:11.219
...that don't like mac and cheese, right?
It's weird.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.598
- Tired, beaux?
- No way.

18:16.262 --> 18:20.859
- Well, I am. Sorry, I'm bushed.
- Please, Dad.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.186
- Come on.
- Dad.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.522
But since we're in this
most excellent cabin...

18:25.730 --> 18:29.109
...and we have all this excellent food,
including this weird ice cream...

18:29.317 --> 18:31.945
...I say slumber party
in the family room.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.576
Right? Come on.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.381
Hey, don't touch those gifts
till I get there.

18:56.344 --> 19:00.975
<i>We must fight to regain our freedom
or everything is lost.</i>

19:01.182 --> 19:02.980
<i>Everything!</i>

20:27.893 --> 20:29.190
<i>Sweet dreams, love.</i>

20:30.229 --> 20:33.950
Ls there a way to stop
from having nightmares, Mom?

20:34.150 --> 20:36.744
Think funny thoughts
before you go to sleep.

20:36.944 --> 20:41.950
I tried that and then I had a dream
about the killer clown guy with big feet.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.877
- With the orange hair that was on fire?
- Yeah.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.671
<i>- I remember. That was not funny.
- No.</i>

20:47.872 --> 20:50.250
Can't you fix it
so I don't have nightmares any more?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.005
Well, that is a tough one...

20:52.209 --> 20:56.430
...but how about we fix it with a kiss
then see how that works?

20:58.048 --> 20:59.971
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.053
- Night, buddy.
- Night, Dad.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.559
Can you fix it so I don't have
nightmares any more?

21:04.764 --> 21:07.938
Sure, just let me put on
my Victoria's Secret tool belt.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.815
Your what?

21:10.728 --> 21:13.356
- What'd Dad break this time, Mom?
- Nothing.

21:13.564 --> 21:16.317
And I am not the klutz
you all make me out to be.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.365
Dad, you broke the hammer
trying to fix the toaster.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.831
That was a very old hammer.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.750
Daddy may not be Mr. Fix-It,
but he does pay for the tools.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.577
Gee, thank you. Thanks, Mom.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.595
Hey, Dad, it's snowing.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.804
- You slept for too long, Daddy.
- I did?

22:26.011 --> 22:29.766
Holy crap. What time is it?
Why didn't you wake me?

22:29.974 --> 22:31.726
We tried.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.154
What have you been doing all this time?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.653
Thanking God we have a TV.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.236
Boy, it's really coming down
out there, huh?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.195
Does that mean we can't go out?

22:43.404 --> 22:46.032
No. It means Dad's glad
we have a TV too.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.162
Aren't you, Dad?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.457
I guess we better get out there
real quick...

22:54.665 --> 22:56.383
...and make ourselves a snowman...

22:56.584 --> 22:59.758
...before it piles up so high
that we can't move.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.010
All in favor?

23:03.340 --> 23:07.061
Come on you, guys. Get your
snow stuff on. That's why we brought it.

23:36.707 --> 23:37.879
Daddy?

23:39.209 --> 23:40.631
Yeah?

23:43.339 --> 23:45.057
What is it, sweetheart?

23:47.426 --> 23:48.973
Cyn?

23:52.222 --> 23:54.600
It's just the door to the attic,
sweetheart.

23:54.808 --> 23:57.652
I think there's something up there.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.113
No. No, no.

24:00.314 --> 24:03.318
You're just letting your imagination
run away with you.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.698
Go on. Get your stuff.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.622
- Dad!
- Jake?

24:12.826 --> 24:15.579
- What's wrong?
- There's something out there.

24:16.622 --> 24:20.468
What's the matter with you kids?
We've all just gotta calm down.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.466
We're gonna make ourselves crazy.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.298
What are you seeing out there?
Was it a bird?

24:25.506 --> 24:26.928
Bigger.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.093
In the trees.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.598
Like a person?

24:35.057 --> 24:36.775
I don't know for sure.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.574
Well, it's just shadows in the trees, buddy.
Just...

24:43.774 --> 24:46.903
Just tree shadows blowing in the wind.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.957
- You feeling okay?
- I'm fine.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.495
- I'm gonna nail Cynthia with a snowball.
- Oh, yeah?

24:55.703 --> 24:57.876
Be careful.
Your sister's got a heck of an arm.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.297
She's just a girl.

24:59.498 --> 25:03.799
So was your mom and she could throw
a fastball like a big leaguer.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.021
It's harder than I thought.

25:26.900 --> 25:27.947
- Hey!
- Gotcha.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.369
I gotcha.

25:30.154 --> 25:33.078
Jake! Help me get your sister!
Boys against the girl!

25:33.282 --> 25:35.785
No, no, no. Kids against big people.

25:37.161 --> 25:38.834
This doesn't sound like fair teams.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.127
Traitors!

25:47.755 --> 25:49.473
Come on! Come on, bring it!

25:50.299 --> 25:51.926
Missed!

25:56.680 --> 25:58.102
Where's Jake?

25:59.349 --> 26:00.441
I don't know.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.123
Jake!

26:18.243 --> 26:19.870
He's hiding.

26:21.663 --> 26:24.416
- Jake!
- Jake!

26:32.382 --> 26:33.679
Jake?

26:37.971 --> 26:39.473
Jake?

26:44.144 --> 26:45.691
Jake!

26:46.355 --> 26:48.858
Open the door! Jake!

26:50.400 --> 26:53.995
Jake! Open the door!

26:54.696 --> 26:57.916
Jake! Open the door, Jake!

26:59.868 --> 27:02.417
- Why did you lock the door?
- I didn't.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.592
What is this place?

27:11.797 --> 27:14.471
If we need to fix anything,
we've come to the right place.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.097
It's pretty cool, huh?

27:16.301 --> 27:18.599
But you don't know
how to fix anything, Dad.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.727
- Says who?
- Mom.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.559
She used to say you were good
with your brain, not your hands.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.110
Oh, she did, huh?

27:27.771 --> 27:29.114
Cynthia?

27:38.282 --> 27:40.910
Jake, is that the same thing you saw?

27:47.207 --> 27:48.584
Okay.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.046
Change in plans.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.681
I think we're coming down with something.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.350
What do you say we head down...

27:56.550 --> 28:00.646
...we find Mr. Howes
and we ask about seeing a doctor?

28:21.158 --> 28:23.502
- Dad, I have to pee.
- Of course, you do. Go on.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.830
Quickly, both of you. Okay?

28:37.716 --> 28:39.764
Quickly, You 9UY5...

28:58.070 --> 28:59.788
I love you.

29:01.949 --> 29:04.122
Hey. Hey...

29:04.326 --> 29:05.794
Okay.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.473
Guys?

29:20.342 --> 29:22.936
Guys! We gotta go! I'll start the car.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.519
My God.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.976
How could this happen already?

30:23.697 --> 30:25.995
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Goddamn it!

30:48.305 --> 30:50.353
Hey, you guys.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.860
<i>You know...</i>

30:54.644 --> 30:56.942
...looks like the car's pretty sick too.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.194
And...

30:59.232 --> 31:01.655
A little snowy. 80...

31:02.569 --> 31:04.321
What do you say...

31:04.905 --> 31:08.409
...we go back inside, make a nice fire...

31:08.617 --> 31:10.085
...some SOUP.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.287
All the good stuff Mom used to do.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.966
- Little cold never hurt anybody. Right?
- Dad, I'm scared.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.918
Why did Mom want us to come here?

31:18.502 --> 31:21.551
- She thought it would be fun.
- It's not fun, Dad.

31:22.339 --> 31:25.092
I know. But it will be.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.436
Come on! Come on. We'll have fun.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.417
Could we walk, Dad? To the doctor?

31:51.618 --> 31:54.246
- I think Jake's really sick.
- We're miles from anywhere.

31:55.288 --> 31:58.383
We're knee deep in snow.
We'd just make him worse.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.806
Besides, since when do you like to walk?

32:10.220 --> 32:13.440
Yeah, I do hate to walk.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.902
And there's nothing
to be scared of here, right?

32:18.395 --> 32:21.114
Yeah, nothing scary here.

32:24.734 --> 32:25.906
All right.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.080
You know what I think?

32:29.406 --> 32:32.250
We toured the other day,
but way too quickly.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.579
- Follow me.
- Dad.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.382
What about upstairs under the beds?
Could we check those too?

32:39.583 --> 32:42.177
Nothing to worry about under beds, buddy.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.880
Still, could you check?

32:45.422 --> 32:47.095
It's on my list.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.285
Daddy, what are we looking for?

33:11.490 --> 33:12.912
Nothing.

33:13.116 --> 33:17.371
Just making sure
there's nothing to worry about.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.067
And there isn't. Come on.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.027
Come on.

33:50.153 --> 33:52.451
Under the bed too, Dad.

33:52.656 --> 33:56.286
Monsters don't hide under beds, Jake.
That's an old wives' tale.

33:56.493 --> 34:01.624
Monsters don't hide anywhere
because there are no monsters.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.504
That's a fact.

34:07.921 --> 34:09.594
Dad, we should keep checking.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.847
Yeah. No, I'm just taking a minute
to catch my breath.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.016
I haven't had this much exercise
in a long time.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.724
The air is thinner up here, I think.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.741
Nothing.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.792
Checked downstairs.
Checked the bedrooms.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.791
I think it's time for a little lunch.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.873
What do you say? I'm hungry.
How about you guys?

34:45.625 --> 34:49.425
Lunch? It's nighttime, Daddy.
What's wrong with you?

34:50.380 --> 34:51.757
What?

35:00.682 --> 35:03.526
Of course, it is. But that doesn't matter.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.775
Peanut butter and jelly
you can have anytime.

35:05.979 --> 35:08.573
Lunch, dinner. Right, Cyn?

35:09.733 --> 35:11.531
Can we check the bathroom?

35:12.485 --> 35:13.907
The...

35:14.446 --> 35:16.915
Right. Right. Check the bathroom.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.005
What happened in here?

35:29.586 --> 35:30.758
Did you guys...?

35:33.381 --> 35:35.133
Did one of you take Daddy's pills?

35:36.301 --> 35:37.598
- No.
- Jake?

35:37.802 --> 35:40.055
Did you do this?
Were you looking for something?

35:40.263 --> 35:42.982
No, Dad.
You know how OCD he is.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.607
- He would've cleaned it up.
- I didn't do anything.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.950
Jake?

36:06.081 --> 36:07.674
That's what we needed.

36:09.626 --> 36:12.379
Not Mom, but not bad.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.841
- It was good, Dad. Really.
- Yeah, Dad.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.849
Really good. Better than Mom's.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.853
I can't remember one thing
that your mother wasn't good at.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.278
Can you?

36:31.314 --> 36:32.782
She couldn't sing.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.531
Yeah.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.955
Of course, neither can I.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.793
Okay. House is locked up.

36:43.993 --> 36:47.588
Checked everywhere.
We're safe and sound.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.796
Is it coming for us'?

36:54.337 --> 36:55.839
Why did you say that?

36:58.007 --> 37:00.101
Answer me, Jake.
Why did you say that?

37:00.301 --> 37:02.645
- I don't know.
- Why are you so afraid?

37:02.846 --> 37:05.725
Why are you acting so weird, Dad?

37:09.477 --> 37:10.899
I don't...

37:12.063 --> 37:13.736
I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry. I...

37:17.527 --> 37:20.155
The truth is Daddy doesn't really know
what's going on.

37:20.363 --> 37:21.785
<i>But...</i>

37:21.990 --> 37:24.789
Nothing is coming for us, okay?

37:30.790 --> 37:32.713
- Dad, don't go!
- But what if it's help?

37:32.917 --> 37:34.840
I wanna go home, Daddy, please.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.888
Listen, you guys. Listen to me.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.808
We can't hide, right?
They know we're here.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.886
And we can't call the police. <i>$0...</i>

37:43.428 --> 37:45.851
- But that's just a lamp, Daddy.
- I know. I know.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.149
But I don't have a lot of options in here.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.068
I'm liking the lamp right now.
It's a good lamp. Heavy.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.271
- Stay here.
- Daddy, let us come with you.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.528
Cynthia, listen to me.

37:55.899 --> 37:57.196
This is probably nothing.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.198
I need you to get under the bed now...

37:59.402 --> 38:02.155
...and stay there until I come back.
You understand me?

38:02.363 --> 38:07.790
Don't make a sound.
Not one sound. Get under. Go.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.477
I hope you don't mind my using
this spare key...

39:10.682 --> 39:14.437
...but nobody answered so I...

39:16.729 --> 39:18.197
Something wrong?

39:22.610 --> 39:25.454
Oh, my God.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.908
Am I glad to see you.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.252
Daddy?

40:59.040 --> 41:00.917
What's going on?

41:01.125 --> 41:03.674
- I really don't know.
- But you're the dad.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.051
You have to know. You have to help us.

41:06.255 --> 41:07.598
I know.

41:08.091 --> 41:10.185
Buddy, I'm trying. I really am.

41:10.385 --> 41:14.106
I'm just... I'm not as good as Mom.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.599
Okay, okay.

41:16.808 --> 41:20.233
It's all right. It's all right.
It's a blown circuit from the storm.

41:20.436 --> 41:24.236
- You're not leaving us again!
- Stay with me. Come on. Come on.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.319
Stay with me.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.883
Daddy, this is one of those things
a person should never do.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.461
Let's just don't go down there, okay?

41:44.669 --> 41:45.966
Come on.

41:46.587 --> 41:50.262
- Something smells funny, Dad.
- It's wet here. Watch your step.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.764
Daddy, I'm not going any further.
Please stop.

41:52.969 --> 41:55.813
Sweetheart, we have to get
the lights back on.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.437
Wouldn't you feel better
with the lights back on?

42:00.768 --> 42:03.191
Daddy, don't go, please.

42:07.734 --> 42:11.455
Let's get out of here. Please, Daddy.

42:15.742 --> 42:17.335
- Cool.
- Yeah, well, apparently...

42:17.535 --> 42:19.537
...your sister doesn't think so.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.332
Cynthia?

42:22.540 --> 42:25.464
It's okay. It's all right.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.797
The rats will stay down there.
They got plenty to eat.

42:35.136 --> 42:37.935
Can it get in, Dad? Can it break in?

42:38.139 --> 42:43.191
No, absolutely not.
I won't let that happen.

42:49.776 --> 42:52.120
Wasn't there duct tape in here before?

42:52.820 --> 42:54.743
There's not enough nails.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.745
- Don't go.
- I have to.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.826
I have to make this house safe for us.

42:59.035 --> 43:01.458
To do that, there's things
I need from the tool shed.

43:01.662 --> 43:02.959
Well, then we have to come.

43:03.164 --> 43:06.634
- No. It's too dangerous.
- Not as dangerous as being alone.

43:11.047 --> 43:13.721
Come on. Come on.

43:21.349 --> 43:22.896
Come on.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.252
There was a shovel there.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.298
Look at this.

43:46.707 --> 43:48.254
Perfect.

43:50.086 --> 43:52.714
God, look at the size of these things.
They're humongous.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.219
Nothing's getting past that.

43:55.383 --> 43:56.760
They're monster-proof.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.433
Totally.

44:00.429 --> 44:01.851
Dad.

44:58.279 --> 45:00.031
I think they're gone.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.126
Get over there. Go on.

45:19.675 --> 45:22.474
We've gotta go. Now! Go!

45:24.055 --> 45:25.682
- Dad!
- Don't look back, Jake!

45:25.890 --> 45:29.190
Go on! As fast as you can!

45:48.537 --> 45:50.790
Daddy, don't leave me here.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.214
Dad!

46:39.213 --> 46:41.591
Your mother always said
I was no good with a hammer.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.016
Look at me now.

47:00.234 --> 47:03.454
- Daddy?
- Okay_

47:03.988 --> 47:05.956
Okay, all right.

47:06.449 --> 47:09.953
This is where we sleep tonight.
All right? All of us.

47:10.453 --> 47:14.629
Good. Come on. Let's brush our teeth.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.342
Come on, you guys.

47:22.214 --> 47:26.094
- What?
- Nail the bathroom too, Dad.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.430
Oh, buddy, we're gonna need the bathroom.

47:28.637 --> 47:31.891
Besides, there's no windows in here.
Nothing's gonna get in.

47:33.267 --> 47:36.737
- We're safe and sound.
- For now.

47:37.396 --> 47:39.114
Oh, God.

47:39.315 --> 47:41.158
No way we're going back in the basement.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.236
No. I know.

47:43.444 --> 47:46.197
Come on.
Maybe we can find some candles.

48:09.970 --> 48:12.564
Remind me I left those there.
We might need them again.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.239
What are we gonna do?

48:21.690 --> 48:23.237
<i>Well...</i>

48:23.609 --> 48:27.705
...nothing's getting past
those monster nails, right?

48:28.864 --> 48:31.538
- We just wait.
- Until what?

48:32.868 --> 48:35.121
Until the storm ends.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.712
But what if it doesn't?

48:40.000 --> 48:43.004
- It will, sweetheart.
- And then what happens?

48:45.089 --> 48:46.636
<i>Then...</i>

48:49.218 --> 48:50.891
Then...

48:51.637 --> 48:56.234
...the Mounties ride in
on their big white horses and rescue us...

48:56.684 --> 49:00.154
...and we find out the whole thing
was just a bunch kids playing pranks.

49:00.354 --> 49:04.734
They get hauled off to juvie for a round
of spankings and no dinner for a week.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.785
- Two weeks.
- Even better.

49:06.986 --> 49:09.830
- Two weeks. Minimum.
- And no dessert.

49:10.030 --> 49:12.874
Absolutely not.
We'll make them eat sand.

49:13.075 --> 49:14.702
Sand?

49:14.910 --> 49:17.254
You know what they call sand for dessert?

49:17.455 --> 49:19.048
Desert.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.506
Come on.

49:39.602 --> 49:43.402
- What is it? What's there?
- Nothing.

49:43.606 --> 49:47.611
- Why'd you make that sound?
- Because there's nothing there.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.697
- The hammer.
- The monster nails. They're gone.

49:55.618 --> 49:57.120
Right.

49:57.536 --> 49:59.504
It's okay. Let's just get upstairs.

49:59.705 --> 50:01.173
Dad?

50:03.167 --> 50:06.137
Maybe it wanted us to nail the doors shut.

50:07.004 --> 50:11.134
- What do you mean?
- Because maybe we didn't lock it out.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.019
Maybe we locked it in.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.894
Something wants us to stay.

51:10.526 --> 51:11.743
Oh, man.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.821
It fell down the hole.

51:14.029 --> 51:15.372
I can't reach it.

51:15.573 --> 51:19.123
Mrs. Shelton is still having trouble
getting over the death of her husband...

51:19.326 --> 51:22.546
...which is not surprising
given the nature of their marriage.

51:22.746 --> 51:26.296
I recommended to her physician
that he prescribe clonazepam.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.844
Guys, I'm working. You know the rules.

51:29.211 --> 51:31.930
Jake's dolly fell into the gutter
and he's having a fit.

51:32.131 --> 51:35.055
I'm not having a fit! He's not a dolly!
He's an action figure!

51:35.259 --> 51:38.479
Hey, hey. Take it easy, Jake.
And Cyn, don't push his buttons. Please.

51:38.679 --> 51:40.898
Hey. Come on.

51:41.223 --> 51:44.898
Mom to the rescue. Let's go.
Not while Dad's working.

51:46.770 --> 51:49.489
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.465
Well, what if he's broken?

52:07.291 --> 52:10.545
- He'll live.
- I'm sure he's fine, sweetheart.

52:24.516 --> 52:26.143
_Mom!
_Mom!

52:29.355 --> 52:32.029
Oh, you guys are too easy.
Here you go.

52:32.232 --> 52:36.078
- Really not that funny, Mom.
- Oh, it was pretty funny.

52:36.278 --> 52:38.030
Thanks, Mom!

52:52.211 --> 52:54.509
- Don't fall asleep, Daddy.
- No.

52:54.713 --> 52:56.465
No, no.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.927
Daddy's okay. Go to sleep.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.191
Daddy's here.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.718
Jake!

53:36.046 --> 53:37.298
Cynthia!

53:38.006 --> 53:40.259
No. No.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.479
Cynthia?

54:19.548 --> 54:21.471
What are you doing?

54:22.634 --> 54:25.638
Where's your brother?
I thought we were gonna stay together.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.069
What is the...?

54:34.229 --> 54:36.152
If you were hungry
why didn't you wake me'?

54:41.028 --> 54:43.531
Since when do you like mac and cheese?

54:48.202 --> 54:50.170
Cynthia, I need you to answer me.

54:52.915 --> 54:54.508
Cyn.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.554
Why won't you look at me?

54:59.713 --> 55:01.590
Why won't you look at me?

55:02.090 --> 55:04.559
Because I don't wanna scare you.

55:11.099 --> 55:14.979
Stop it, Daddy. You're hurting me.

55:15.187 --> 55:17.690
I'm not touching you.

55:20.943 --> 55:25.244
No! Dad!

55:40.462 --> 55:41.839
Jake!

55:52.975 --> 55:54.397
Jake.

55:57.312 --> 55:59.485
Piece of shit.

56:36.643 --> 56:38.486
Jesus!

56:56.204 --> 56:57.922
Jake?

57:03.128 --> 57:04.721
Daddy.

57:06.089 --> 57:07.716
Dad!

58:01.603 --> 58:03.196
Jake.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.904
Cynthia.

58:06.566 --> 58:07.988
<i>[No]</i>

58:08.860 --> 58:12.034
Jake! Cynthia!

58:29.172 --> 58:34.349
You can't take them! Goddamn it! No!

58:43.103 --> 58:45.231
That's impossible.

58:50.819 --> 58:52.867
What is happening?

59:00.328 --> 59:02.296
Where are you?

59:13.717 --> 59:16.846
Daddy, please help.

59:18.346 --> 59:19.814
I'm not losing you two.

59:20.849 --> 59:24.479
- It's too hot.
- Me too.

59:28.273 --> 59:30.367
The keys to his truck.

59:33.695 --> 59:37.199
It's okay. We're leaving.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:31.841
Dad!

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:35.599
Hold on!

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:47.565
Goddamn it!

01:00:56.945 --> 01:00:59.448
It's okay. I got you.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.000
Cynthia?

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.094
Here you go, bud.

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:15.639
Cynthia? Baby?

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:19.684
Please don't leave me.
Don't leave me, honey. I can do this.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:22.604
I can do this all by myself.
I love you guys so much.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.772
I can be a good dad.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:27.271
Can you hear me? Wake up, Cynthia.
Jake, help me.

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:30.445
Wake your... Come on. Come on.

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:33.569
Come on, you guys. Jake!

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.902
Cynthia, wake up.
Come on, baby, wake up.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:40.496
Wake up, Cynthia! Don't...

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:46.874
Kids are your strong suit.
Mine's paying the bills.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:49.456
That's the plan.
That was always the plan. Remember?

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.087
You're better at that.
You're better at everything.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:55.091
- You're better at playing baseball.
- That's crap.

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:58.682
Besides, taking care of the kids...

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:02.682
...takes a lot less energy and time...

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.726
- ...than you think.
- You make it look easy.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:08.308
- Can I have some water?
- I got it. It's okay.

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:09.688
- I got it.
- Yeah? Sure?

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.271
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- I don't mind.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.615
Don't say I didn't offer.

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.285
Leah?

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.337
Everything okay?

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.510
Yeah. Clumsy as usual.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:40.428
Yet, strangely, still sexy.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.306
No!

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:48.725
God, no, Leah! Oh, Goddamn it!

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:59.326
I need an ambulance
at 421 Still Oaks Lane.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:02.075
My wife she fell, she hit her head.
Her neck...

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.031
Oh, God. Hurry, please!

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.539
- What? Don't talk.
- Can't...

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:12.005
- I'm sorry.
- No, Leah, please!

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:15.334
Goddamn it, breathe. Baby!

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:17.878
Come on.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.221
Breathe, Leah.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:37.985
No!

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:04.011
Help me, Daddy.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.558
Dad's here, buddy. It's okay.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.707
Jake! No!

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:37.674
Jake! Jake! Jake!

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:56.143
No!

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.857
No!

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:12.788
Jake.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:19.048
Open, you son of a...

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.338
Jake.

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.093
Jake!

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:33.355
He couldn't have pulled this out.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.353
Jake!

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:43.990
Jake.

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:48.153
Jake.

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:14.809
Howes?

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:24.318
When the storm ended and you didn't
call down for more supplies...

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:28.698
...I figured something might be wrong.
So I come up here to help you.

01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:31.280
- When the storm ended?
- Yeah.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.081
The storm's been over for days.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:36.751
No, no, no, you're wrong. You're wrong!
We've been stranded here for days!

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:38.498
The blizzard...

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.353
Mr. Shade, don't leave me here!

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.410
No.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.245
No, no, no.

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:04.998
No, no, no.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:08.547
<i>It's the cabin I went to
when I was the kids' age.</i>

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:12.676
<i>It's in the middle of nowhere,
and that's what makes it great.</i>

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:22.015
I'm sorry I couldn't save them.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.772
<i>But you did save them.</i>

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:41.202
Okay, guys. Change in plans.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:45.792
I think we're coming down with something.
So, what do you say we head down...

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:49.968
...we find Mr. Howes
and we ask about seeing a doctor?

01:08:58.343 --> 01:08:59.469
I'll be right back.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.278
- It's wet here. Watch your step.
- Help me, Dad.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.741
Just please don't make me
take a bath, Dad, please.

01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:16.323
Bath?

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.413
Nothing to worry about.
We're on bath vacation.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:20.957
I don't wanna take a bath.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.625
- I just wanna sleep.
- I know.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.577
But you have to. You're burning up.

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:28.381
Here you go. It's okay, buddy.
I got you.

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:33.466
I know. I know. I know.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:38.470
What about you, Dad? You're sick too.

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:51.859
Come on!

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:54.357
Did you...?

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.450
Did one of you guys get into this cabinet?

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:03.666
Jake, did you do this?
Were you looking for something?

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:08.042
No, Dad. You know how OCD he is.
He would have cleaned it up.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:13.918
You really gotta drink more.

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:16.596
I think Jack the Ripper is gone with Mom.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:20.471
What? No, sweetheart. Jack's fine.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:25.351
I want you to bury him for me.
Please, Daddy.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.439
<i>I want you to bury him for me.</i>

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:53.591
Mr. Shade. Are you folks all right?

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.543
There was no answer so I...

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:58.722
Am I glad to see you.

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:07.147
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- You son of a bitch.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:09.933
- Sorry?
- It was you.

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.893
You knew you were sick. I asked you.

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:15.605
I asked you if you were sick!
"No, I'm just getting over something!"

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:18.566
You bastard!
You put your hands all over my kids!

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:20.527
You stupid son of a bitch!

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.469
- Get upstairs.
- Please, Mr. Shade!

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:40.592
Get upstairs!

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:44.433
I'm sorry.

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.095
But you killed my kids.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.187
Daddy?

01:11:58.356 --> 01:11:59.824
Are you okay?

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.787
Am I okay?

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:09.325
Your fever's broke.

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:12.290
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:13.792
- Yeah?
- Me too.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.339
Yeah, you feel better?

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.968
Come here. Come here.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.232
Stay close to me.

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:02.463
- Check both doors in that area.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:07.133
Mr. Shade?
We've been banging on that door forever.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.720
- I'm sorry we had to knock it down.
- It's okay.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:18.603
- Hey, we found him. Howes is up here.
- I'll be right back.

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:26.777
- Thanks.
- We got a search and rescue team...

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:29.080
...looking for you three days now.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.827
Come on.

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:32.625
All right, I'm okay.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:42.005
Don't worry. We'll get you home.
Lock his ass up.

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:45.592
When I saw him, he was so sick...

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:48.515
...half out of his mind with a fever,
I suppose.

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:51.560
He'll get what's coming to him.
