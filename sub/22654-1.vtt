01:42.477 --> 01:44.514
The sunset over Mount Huaguo
is more beautiful than any fairyland.

01:45.897 --> 01:49.481
This is all that the monkey remembers
of Mount Huaguo.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.025
The monkey once heard a legend

01:54.740 --> 01:56.481
that in the depths of the Heavenly Kingdom

01:56.658 --> 01:59.947
the Destiny Astrolabe controls the fate
of all living things.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.368
However, the stone that Nwa used
to patch the sky bred a giant

02:05.083 --> 02:06.790
that refused to accept its fate.

02:08.377 --> 02:12.122
The Heavenly Kingdom claims any living thing
does not submit to control is a demon.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.342
The giant became a devil.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.969
The gods threw everything they had
at besieging the devil,

02:19.306 --> 02:22.140
but they were all killed by the devil.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.934
The heavens and the earth shocked with his fury.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.015
However,

02:27.397 --> 02:28.729
he was defeated in the end.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.350
Fierce lightning tore the giant's body to pieces.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.651
And the fragments of his body fell
and scattered across the earth.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.897
Mount Huaguo was born.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.528
The heart of the stone
that patched the sky lived on

02:43.830 --> 02:45.366
and evolved into the monkey.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.750
The monkey grew up at the foot of Mount Huaguo
with the company of sunset all over the sky.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.836
But the Destiny Astrolabe found him,

02:56.802 --> 02:58.794
and the heavens burst forth
in flame burning all plants

02:58.970 --> 03:00.711
and extinguished all living creatures in heavy snow.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.425
Mount Huaguo was left in ruins.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.968
The monkey disappeared.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.597
The monkey was furious

03:11.775 --> 03:12.982
and vowed that as long as he was still alive,

03:13.151 --> 03:14.767
he would destroy the Heavenly Kingdom

03:14.861 --> 03:16.898
and wreak havoc there.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.278
However,

03:18.990 --> 03:20.401
the sky he could see

03:20.409 --> 03:22.241
was covered in darkness.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.585
(Destiny Council)

03:51.273 --> 03:52.514
My Lord.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.437
Mount Huaguo was destroyed 300 years ago.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.693
The Destiny Astrolabe has run consistently.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.779
The heart of the stone has disappeared.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.816
There is none left to challenge the might
of the Heavenly Kingdom.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.963
Attention,

04:22.512 --> 04:25.630
it is the 1,000-year changing
of the guard at the Destiny Council.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.048
The Academy of Destiny

04:27.058 --> 04:30.301
is responsible for selecting succeeding immortals.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.846
You have all undergone rigorous selection

04:32.856 --> 04:34.017
from various departments

04:34.024 --> 04:36.391
and are the wisest with the greatest potential
to ascend to immortality.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.185
You will be divided into

04:39.321 --> 04:42.234
two sects in your spiritual journey here

04:42.574 --> 04:43.655
The Heavenly Sect,

04:43.950 --> 04:47.409
those selected from
outstanding descendants of the gods,

04:48.663 --> 04:49.779
and the Earthly Sect,

04:50.123 --> 04:51.830
the most hardworking pupils that

04:52.042 --> 04:54.034
conducted their spiritual journey
in the world of men.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.709
Our Lady

04:55.712 --> 04:57.044
will award the third class peaches that

04:57.047 --> 04:58.629
the Queen Mother of the West personally gave her

04:59.216 --> 05:01.924
to the top disciples of the Heavenly Sect

05:18.527 --> 05:19.483
Azi?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.186
Azi!

05:22.197 --> 05:23.483
The ceremony is about to begin.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.822
What are you doing sitting here?

05:25.617 --> 05:28.701
I'm not doing anything, just watching the sunset.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.953
Then I'll be going.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.242
Hurry up.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.606
Hey!

06:10.036 --> 06:10.651
Stop!

06:26.469 --> 06:28.426
I've always watched others eat.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.463
Now it's my turn to have a taste.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.431
I heard that these peaches

06:32.976 --> 06:34.808
are really juicy.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.057
Prince Juling,

06:37.147 --> 06:38.683
the peaches are coming.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.352
Where is she taking it?

06:45.030 --> 06:45.611
Hurry,

06:45.614 --> 06:46.320
bring her here and teach her a lesson.

06:46.323 --> 06:46.733
OK.

06:47.991 --> 06:48.731
Come here!

06:49.951 --> 06:51.567
Put your peach here.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.658
I told you to put your peach down here.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.330
Let me go.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.244
Sit!

07:00.378 --> 07:02.085
What are you doing? Help!

07:02.464 --> 07:04.296
Get the assassin. Get the assassin.

07:05.216 --> 07:05.876
Catch her.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.007
I did not do it on purpose

07:07.427 --> 07:08.133
Sorry

07:08.136 --> 07:09.627
Are you here to assassinate me?

07:09.888 --> 07:11.629
I'm just here to deliver the peach.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.718
Is this the peach?

07:17.854 --> 07:18.844
How dare you eat my peach

07:20.231 --> 07:21.221
Applause!

07:24.527 --> 07:26.484
I'm JuanLian

07:29.032 --> 07:30.523
Juling, show some respect.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.241
You shouldn't hit women.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.661
I mustn't hit women?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.488
I can also hit men.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.296
You mustn't hit men!

07:50.929 --> 07:51.544
Great!

07:57.060 --> 07:58.426
No clapping!

08:04.526 --> 08:05.937
I'll protect you.

09:17.932 --> 09:18.763
Awesome!

09:29.360 --> 09:30.601
I can't eat the peach?

09:32.197 --> 09:33.483
Why didn't you say earlier?

09:34.032 --> 09:35.022
And then you started beating them.

09:35.784 --> 09:36.649
If you're going to fight anyone,

09:38.953 --> 09:39.909
fight me.

09:44.751 --> 09:45.582
Get him!

09:45.710 --> 09:47.292
Do what he did to me back to him.

09:48.046 --> 09:48.661
Wait. Wait. Wait.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.253
Wait up. Wait up.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.366
That's better.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.588
I'm sorry.

10:33.675 --> 10:34.586
Recently

10:34.717 --> 10:35.798
I had a lot of earwax.

11:01.202 --> 11:01.692
My Lady.

11:01.703 --> 11:02.363
What is it?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.743
Bad news. The disciples are fighting.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.162
My Lady,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.202
please go to the side chamber and rest.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.412
Tianpeng.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.392
Do you know who I am?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.349
Listen up!

11:33.860 --> 11:35.726
For the rest of your lives

11:36.070 --> 11:38.027
you will remember my name.

11:38.573 --> 11:39.654
My name is...

11:39.782 --> 11:40.738
It's you.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.400
You're the one that stole the peach
and got my friend in trouble.

11:42.785 --> 11:43.650
Do you think you're something special?

11:43.828 --> 11:44.864
Do you think your martial arts are amazing?

11:44.871 --> 11:45.486
What are you hitting me for?

11:45.496 --> 11:46.282
I saved you, you silly witch.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.203
Damn monkey.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.200
How do I look like a monkey?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.198
You do if I say you do.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.620
Damn monkey!

11:51.461 --> 11:53.123
Idiotic simpletons like you

11:53.254 --> 11:55.871
aren't even qualified to serve Chalky.

11:56.049 --> 11:56.835
You...

11:58.218 --> 11:59.049
Who's Chalky?

12:04.307 --> 12:05.093
Let me tell you.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.678
Listen up.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.391
What are you shh-ing for?

12:08.853 --> 12:09.434
Shh my foot!

12:10.021 --> 12:11.228
I haven't finished speaking.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.851
Chalky, let's go.

12:15.068 --> 12:15.728
Bye-bye.

12:27.163 --> 12:27.949
My name is...

12:27.956 --> 12:28.696
Cut your crap.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.711
Stop!

14:03.051 --> 14:04.758
Get out of the way!

14:24.697 --> 14:25.904
How come you're so late?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.566
Are you hurt?

14:28.743 --> 14:29.608
Of course not.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.116
Who are you?

14:34.457 --> 14:35.948
I'm Erlang from Guankou of the Kunlun Mountains,

14:38.169 --> 14:39.410
also known as Yang Jian.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.183
Do you know who I am?

17:02.230 --> 17:03.186
Listen up.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.023
For the rest of your lives

17:07.443 --> 17:09.730
you will remember my name.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.191
My name is...

17:16.452 --> 17:17.192
Sun

17:18.496 --> 17:19.612
Wu

17:20.039 --> 17:21.496
Kong

17:30.633 --> 17:31.965
I thought you'd never shut up.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.094
Don't think I'm afraid of you.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.097
I'll beat you to death with this stick.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.273
Don't think you can get away. Don't move.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.523
I'll go over there and kill you.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.314
I'll go over there
and beat the living hell out of you.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.060
You blasted monkey!

17:55.324 --> 17:58.192
His name is Sun Wukong and he comes
from no sect that we know of.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.068
However, his power and magic

18:00.454 --> 18:03.037
have broken all records for 100 years
in the Academy of Destiny.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.077
So we broke the rules in taking him down.

18:05.418 --> 18:05.908
But we never imagined...

18:06.085 --> 18:07.246
My Lady,

18:07.753 --> 18:08.618
I was wrong.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.460
I was absent at the opening ceremony,

18:09.463 --> 18:10.044
caused trouble in the great hall

18:10.047 --> 18:10.753
and broke academy rules.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.496
It will not happen again.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.168
Just punish that damned monkey.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.753
Erlang has just got back,

18:15.344 --> 18:16.835
and I was the one that told him to do it.

18:16.846 --> 18:17.677
Just punish me.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.097
I sent Tianpeng to take care of things

18:21.225 --> 18:22.807
but Yang Jian interfered

18:22.893 --> 18:24.134
violating academy rules.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.190
I sent you down to undergo spiritual cultivation.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.366
But 100 years later,

18:40.703 --> 18:42.615
But you haven't improved.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.656
You do actually remember that we haven't
seen each other for a hundred years.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.870
Mother,

18:47.960 --> 18:49.121
I made this.

18:49.337 --> 18:49.952
It can protect you.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.542
Take care of yourself.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.184
Tianpeng,

19:10.775 --> 19:12.357
I will always remember

19:12.693 --> 19:14.104
you no matter how many years passes

19:35.549 --> 19:36.585
Yang Jian.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.250
You are called Yang Jian, right?

19:39.553 --> 19:42.921
You look like a stiff corpse. This isn't a funeral.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.472
Didn't you looked mighty a minute ago?

19:44.892 --> 19:47.100
But now look at you.
You're locked up in here with me.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.849
The Heavenly Kingdom has rules.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.355
Fighting is a punishable offense.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.233
So two of you against me is a rule
of the Heavenly Kingdom.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.269
You still lost.

19:58.197 --> 19:58.937
Lost?

19:59.115 --> 20:00.481
I don't accept that.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.198
Let's go again.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.024
Come on.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.363
Let's do it again.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.655
What? Don't you want to fight?

20:08.541 --> 20:09.702
Now I remember.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.539
Just now those jerks over there
were laughing about

20:12.545 --> 20:14.411
how your mother broke the divine law

20:14.588 --> 20:15.829
She fell in love with a mortal

20:16.090 --> 20:17.877
and is now trapped under Mount Tao.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.751
Then she gave birth to you, a freak that
is neither human nor immortal.

20:20.886 --> 20:21.922
Say that again.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.883
To put it simply,

20:24.807 --> 20:25.888
you are a mongrel.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.475
Our Lady.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.603
My Lady.

20:39.864 --> 20:40.650
Yang Jian

20:40.865 --> 20:42.322
go back to the Destiny Council and wait for me.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.321
What's going on?

20:45.536 --> 20:46.196
Why is he allowed to go?

20:46.203 --> 20:47.364
What about me?

20:48.038 --> 20:50.075
Do you really think no one can control you?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.374
There is no one on earth that can defeat me.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.582
So I came up here

20:53.586 --> 20:55.373
to have some fun with you immortals.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.462
Is that a reward for me?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.002
This reward,

21:04.013 --> 21:05.129
this reward should not just belong to me,

21:05.139 --> 21:06.095
but to all of us.

21:09.977 --> 21:10.888
That...

21:14.648 --> 21:15.604
Come.

21:15.858 --> 21:16.644
Give it here.

21:22.573 --> 21:23.313
Wait.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.319
This is yours?

21:37.379 --> 21:38.369
That's it?

22:09.453 --> 22:09.909
That,

22:09.912 --> 22:11.699
that damned monkey deserved that.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.862
He brazenly destroyed the grand hall,

22:12.873 --> 22:13.533
endangered the disciples

22:13.749 --> 22:15.331
and almost even hurt me.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.041
And he got Erlang in trouble.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.335
My Lady, how about this?

22:19.630 --> 22:21.542
Give that golden lotus wand to me

22:22.007 --> 22:23.464
and I'll discipline him for you,

22:24.009 --> 22:25.671
and make sure everyone is safe.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.428
You can't even keep yourself disciplined.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.630
How can you discipline others?

22:31.892 --> 22:33.724
Please give me this opportunity.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.232
Nothing can defeat him?

22:58.961 --> 22:59.997
Monkey

23:02.548 --> 23:04.164
They destroyed Mount Huaguo,

23:05.426 --> 23:07.167
and wanted to eliminate your undying heart.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.880
They said it was fate.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.393
Heart of the stone,

23:17.646 --> 23:19.683
I finally found you.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.769
In the beginning you didn't know anything.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.193
To get rid of stubbornness,
you have to understand everything.

23:30.326 --> 23:33.660
You will be called Sun Wukong from now on.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.456
While the heart of the stone lives on,

23:38.584 --> 23:41.042
the Heavenly Kingdom will never let you be.

23:41.295 --> 23:45.710
I have sealed your power
inside the form of a human.

23:46.050 --> 23:49.088
I will teach you everything I can.

23:49.428 --> 23:53.672
Just follow the path you choose.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.587
Do you know

24:25.756 --> 24:28.123
why you cannot open your heavenly eye?

24:28.717 --> 24:30.959
I sent you to roam the earth for years,

24:31.387 --> 24:33.629
and although you can differentiate
the heavens from the earth,

24:33.806 --> 24:35.388
you have nothing but your mother and Azi

24:35.474 --> 24:37.807
in your heart.

24:37.977 --> 24:38.967
But as an immortal,

24:39.061 --> 24:41.144
you should embrace
all living creatures on the earth.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.888
You must dismiss your personal emotions

24:44.233 --> 24:47.317
before your heavenly eye can awake
and bestow you with unlimited power.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.855
Only then

24:48.988 --> 24:51.401
can you become a real immortal.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.488
You're awake.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.115
What are you doing?

25:02.668 --> 25:03.875
Why have you done this to me?

25:03.877 --> 25:05.209
What is it?

25:05.379 --> 25:06.415
I cut it for you.

25:06.672 --> 25:07.913
Do you like it?

25:14.263 --> 25:15.219
Why?

25:15.514 --> 25:16.630
Why?

25:16.890 --> 25:18.006
What do you think?

25:18.225 --> 25:20.217
Why did you cut my hair?

25:20.394 --> 25:20.929
You '.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.136
This hairstyle suits

25:23.480 --> 25:24.345
your band.

25:24.773 --> 25:25.980
Where's my master's scarf?

25:26.066 --> 25:27.523
Give my scarf back.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.647
Your scarf was filthy. I had it washed for you.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.317
Look, you look like a beggar.

25:33.449 --> 25:34.405
How can I take you anywhere

25:34.408 --> 25:35.990
if you look like that?

25:35.993 --> 25:37.325
Look how clean Chalky is.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.660
I don't want to be your servant.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.580
Do you really think that this can control me?

25:46.170 --> 25:47.627
You underestimate me, Sun

25:48.297 --> 25:49.663
Wu...

25:50.716 --> 25:51.923
Don't waste your energy.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.045
This is a holy article of the Heavenly Kingdom.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.384
Even I can't take it off

25:54.762 --> 25:56.003
Right now, I'm the only one

25:56.013 --> 25:57.800
that can recite the spell.

25:57.931 --> 25:58.762
OK.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.886
I can accept you

26:00.976 --> 26:02.763
as my servant.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.390
Call me My Lady.

26:06.899 --> 26:07.639
Say the spell then.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.232
I dare you

26:09.902 --> 26:11.018
You don't know what you're dealing with.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.518
I am from hell.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.900
My hands are stained with blood.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.614
None of rare beasts, the old, weak,

26:16.617 --> 26:18.859
women or children escape my wrath.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.570
My Lady, I apologize.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.404
Sit.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.156
Sit!

26:30.756 --> 26:33.123
You're a good boy.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.500
Smile.

26:38.097 --> 26:38.962
Bloody witch!

26:39.098 --> 26:40.760
Do you really think I'm afraid of you?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.274
What's that noise?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.721
Pervert.

27:33.527 --> 27:36.110
Yesterday I thought you were a righteous hero.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.654
Who would have thought that
you would try such filth today?

27:38.866 --> 27:40.277
Who told you to come out?

27:40.868 --> 27:42.530
I didn't come out. I came from up there.

27:42.536 --> 27:43.322
Get back up there.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.944
It's easy getting down,
but getting back up is not so easy.

27:45.080 --> 27:45.820
Get out!

27:46.039 --> 27:47.405
Pull me back up!

27:48.375 --> 27:49.786
You think you can fool me like that?

27:49.793 --> 27:50.874
I won't be fooled.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.251
Women

27:52.254 --> 27:53.165
are beyond reason.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.791
Get lost!

28:01.722 --> 28:04.681
This is the kitchen with the best scenery
in the Heavenly Kingdom.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.299
You can stay here.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.434
Then I'll be...

28:22.993 --> 28:23.858
Why?

28:24.620 --> 28:27.613
Why did you destroy so many beautiful places?

28:27.748 --> 28:29.034
I don't understand.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.702
I don't accept it.

28:30.876 --> 28:31.912
My Lady,

28:31.919 --> 28:33.126
it was all my fault.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.664
Don't punish Azi.

28:35.881 --> 28:36.792
Yang Jian,

28:36.882 --> 28:39.090
your mother has been imprisoned under Mount Tao.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.174
You are neither human nor immortal

28:40.177 --> 28:41.463
and come from humble origins.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.882
I brought you here from the
Kunlun Mountains and promoted you

28:44.014 --> 28:46.256
because you had never made mistakes.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.132
You have really let me down.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.349
Erlang,

28:49.478 --> 28:50.184
I'm sorry

28:50.312 --> 28:51.428
for getting you into trouble.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.690
I want to become a great immortal.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.980
I'm going to save everyone.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.898
I want to be a great immortal, too.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.237
I will always protect you.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.534
Erlang,

29:10.624 --> 29:12.331
I'm sorry for getting you in trouble again.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.290
It's nothing.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.326
You've been down in the world of humans
for so long. Did you have fun?

29:15.587 --> 29:16.919
There's nothing fun down there.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.666
You told me that you like flowers.

29:22.386 --> 29:23.593
This is for you.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.880
What is it?

29:27.474 --> 29:28.931
Seeds of the most beautiful flowers

29:29.017 --> 29:31.225
that I saw on my journeys.

29:31.812 --> 29:32.552
If you like,

29:33.188 --> 29:34.975
I can make the Heavenly Kingdom
look like the human world:

29:35.399 --> 29:36.640
full of flowers.

29:38.026 --> 29:38.857
Really?

29:39.111 --> 29:40.397
OK.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.858
How has it been since I left?

29:43.865 --> 29:44.776
I've treated him well.

29:44.908 --> 29:45.739
Look how fat it is.

29:45.826 --> 29:46.862
It's really fine.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.909
It's so fat that it can't even
put on a suit of armor.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.323
Xiaotian, let's go.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.037
I told you, its name's Chalky.

29:52.374 --> 29:53.490
But he's black.

29:53.667 --> 29:54.783
He's white.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.705
Fine. He's white if you say so.

29:56.962 --> 29:57.873
Chalky, tell him that

29:57.879 --> 29:59.211
you're white.

30:00.882 --> 30:01.463
My Lady,

30:01.550 --> 30:02.586
I have followed your commands

30:02.676 --> 30:03.883
and I am monitoring Sun Wukong.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.711
He has some purpose for being here.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.716
If you give the order...

30:11.977 --> 30:13.889
Wait for me to confirm something first.

30:26.199 --> 30:29.863
You say you want to become invincible.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.533
What's so great about being invincible?

30:34.207 --> 30:36.995
At least I can control my own destiny.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.873
All destiny in this world

30:44.176 --> 30:46.759
is controlled by the Destiny Astrolabe.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.804
With it, the Heavenly Kingdom
can balance the three realms

30:49.931 --> 30:51.297
and govern all souls.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.725
No one can stop it.

30:54.895 --> 30:55.806
I don't care.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.388
I will go to the Heavenly Kingdom and destroy it.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.858
I will destroy the Destiny Astrolabe

31:15.499 --> 31:16.489
The Destiny Council

31:16.500 --> 31:19.789
is located at the highest of the thirty-six heavens.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.248
It commands the three realms,

31:21.338 --> 31:22.044
the six destinies,

31:22.214 --> 31:22.795
the five elements

31:22.923 --> 31:24.255
and the forces of yin and yang.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.557
Behind this gate

31:39.648 --> 31:42.607
is the enchanted bridge that leads
to the Destiny Astrolabe

31:42.734 --> 31:45.647
as well as the boundary that separates the
human world from the Heavenly Kingdom.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.363
If you fall off,

31:49.491 --> 31:53.075
the power of the enchantment
will suck all off your immortal powers

31:53.412 --> 31:57.497
and you will vanish and die without a trace.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.640
This is the control room.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.721
The heavens, the earth, the sun, the moon,

32:17.894 --> 32:19.385
the wind, thunder, rain, lightning

32:19.396 --> 32:20.728
the changes in the four seasons,

32:21.565 --> 32:23.898
all celestial events that mortals witness

32:24.025 --> 32:26.267
are operated from here.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.197
What are you doing?

32:31.408 --> 32:32.194
Nothing.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.784
Don't make trouble in the Heavenly Kingdom.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.490
And what if I do?

32:38.290 --> 32:38.825
You...

32:38.832 --> 32:40.198
What will you do?

32:49.885 --> 32:53.424
This is the Destiny Astrolabe,

32:53.930 --> 32:56.422
the core area in the Destiny Council.

32:56.892 --> 33:01.853
Greetings My Lady.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.396
The first thing you will learn in today's lesson

33:04.733 --> 33:06.019
is an understanding of

33:06.109 --> 33:07.645
of the balance between the heavens and the earth.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.860
This is Mount Huaguo.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.318
The devil once reincarnated
and hid himself here.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.370
300 years ago,

33:24.544 --> 33:27.628
we complied with the heavens' orders
and wiped out the devil.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.927
The fires of heaven raged for months

33:36.014 --> 33:38.131
and ice covered the mountain for years,

33:38.475 --> 33:40.762
thoroughly cleansing Mount Huaguo

33:40.769 --> 33:43.352
and finally restoring a balance
to the heavens and the earth.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.568
Right now, this land

33:50.987 --> 33:52.979
should have been restored to life,

33:53.156 --> 33:55.864
But the land dried up, of years of disasters

33:55.867 --> 33:57.028
caused by the evil spirit
that permeates the land there,

33:57.202 --> 33:59.194
life is nothing but despair.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.778
Possibly,

34:00.997 --> 34:03.330
the devil still lives.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.075
By the mercy of the gods,

34:06.253 --> 34:09.621
it is time again to cleanse this land of evil.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.087
Rubbish!

34:20.766 --> 34:23.134
That used to be a beautiful land.

34:23.687 --> 34:26.054
It is like this now because of your cruelty.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.561
Why don't you give them a chance to be reborn?

34:29.650 --> 34:30.311
The ones that err

34:30.443 --> 34:31.228
should be punished.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.061
But they shouldn't be killed.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.565
I refuse any orders from heaven like that.

34:38.159 --> 34:38.945
Answer me,

34:39.244 --> 34:42.157
if it was your own child, would you kill it?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.449
If the heavens decried it,

34:43.623 --> 34:45.080
I would do so without a second thought.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.036
Finally I realize why you treat me like this.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.185
Don't go.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.347
Wait for me.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.347
Have you finished?

35:10.609 --> 35:11.440
You...

35:11.526 --> 35:12.858
You are her daughter.

35:13.653 --> 35:14.143
What are you doing?

35:14.154 --> 35:15.315
Give it back.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.106
Stay away from me.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.120
I was right.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.663
The heart of the stone was not destroyed.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.328
The devil

35:32.464 --> 35:34.205
lives on.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.464
We can't let him disturb the Heavenly Kingdom.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.175
Find an opportunity to kill him.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.219
Bring me the heart of the stone.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.305
Azi?

35:50.649 --> 35:51.935
Azi?

35:59.699 --> 36:01.110
You invite me here

36:01.242 --> 36:02.699
and then hide?

36:03.787 --> 36:04.868
What do you mean by this?

36:42.450 --> 36:44.737
The enchanted bridge is a forbidden area
of the Heavenly Kingdom.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.077
You stole the entrance warrant.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.413
You are here

36:49.666 --> 36:51.282
not to become an immortal,

36:52.043 --> 36:53.124
but for some other scheme.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.664
Enough. Enough.

36:54.671 --> 36:55.752
Enough!

36:56.339 --> 36:58.422
What's so good about being an immortal?

36:58.675 --> 36:59.882
Do you really think that I can't defeat you?

37:41.384 --> 37:42.170
Damn monkey,

37:42.302 --> 37:43.008
I want a word with you.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.475
Why did you knock me out?

37:55.607 --> 37:57.098
Is this what you're into?

37:58.234 --> 37:59.350
Just tell me straight.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.434
What are you doing here?

38:00.570 --> 38:01.310
Where's that damned monkey?

38:05.950 --> 38:06.690
You're leaving?

38:15.210 --> 38:15.950
Don't waste time.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.310
Erlang!

38:39.275 --> 38:40.061
Stay away!

39:40.712 --> 39:42.374
Meteorite

39:48.303 --> 39:49.919
They destroyed Mount Huaguo,

39:50.471 --> 39:52.053
and wanted to eliminate your undying heart.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.222
They said it was fate.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.925
And the ice covered the mountain for years,

39:56.728 --> 39:59.846
thoroughly cleansing Mount Huaguo.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.642
I don't care.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.356
I will go to the Heavenly Kingdom and destroy it.

40:03.610 --> 40:04.646
Remember

40:05.278 --> 40:07.645
why you are here.

41:11.928 --> 41:12.793
Azi.

41:14.681 --> 41:15.546
Are you OK?

41:18.685 --> 41:20.096
We're not dead?

41:23.523 --> 41:25.310
What just happened?

41:26.776 --> 41:27.562
Where is this?

41:32.156 --> 41:33.613
This is Mount Huaguo.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.453
He is the reincarnation
of the devil 300 years ago.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.540
The heart of the stone block off
the power of the enchantment

41:43.793 --> 41:45.580
brought us here.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.715
I won't let you go back alive.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.343
If I can't go back,

41:54.804 --> 41:56.136
don't think about going back either.

41:58.599 --> 41:59.385
Then let's see.

41:59.726 --> 42:00.261
Come on.

42:00.685 --> 42:01.300
Come on.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.258
Careful. Don't go over there.

42:56.616 --> 42:57.527
Stop it!

42:57.533 --> 42:58.523
Without any powers, how can you fight?

42:59.577 --> 43:00.943
It's my turn to show you what I can do.

43:00.953 --> 43:01.864
A fire and ice crossbow.

43:01.954 --> 43:02.785
It's driven by physics.

43:02.955 --> 43:04.321
It doesn't need any magic.

43:04.749 --> 43:05.409
I invented it.

43:06.459 --> 43:07.745
Stop it. Don't fight.

43:11.714 --> 43:12.579
Everyone's here.

43:18.638 --> 43:19.754
What's going on?

43:20.181 --> 43:20.796
Keep it down.

43:21.766 --> 43:22.552
Kill it!

43:24.894 --> 43:27.056
What can we do without any powers, Azi?

43:29.440 --> 43:30.601
Break in!

43:31.359 --> 43:32.440
Give me.

43:33.277 --> 43:33.937
Azi! Azi!

43:36.155 --> 43:36.690
Stay back!

43:46.582 --> 43:47.538
Stay away, demon!

43:47.667 --> 43:48.703
We're not demons.

43:48.876 --> 43:49.912
Shut it.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.705
Anything that falls from the sky is a demon.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.704
Kill them. Kill them.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.004
We really aren't.

43:55.091 --> 43:56.207
We won't. We won't.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.376
Mortal men, don't forget your manners.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.214
This doesn't look good.

44:00.429 --> 44:02.011
Azi, get out of here. I don't want you getting hurt.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.802
I'll show you my ultimate move.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.349
A thousand fists!

44:15.820 --> 44:17.106
There are bogus demons, too.

44:17.113 --> 44:17.978
Do not be afraid

44:18.114 --> 44:19.321
Get him. Get him.

44:19.448 --> 44:20.438
Kill him. Kill him!

44:26.247 --> 44:27.829
You want to stop me

44:27.957 --> 44:29.164
and kill me.

44:30.459 --> 44:32.200
It's taken me 300 years.

44:32.295 --> 44:33.206
300 years!

44:33.379 --> 44:35.621
You'll never succeed.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.585
Even if it takes me another 3,000 years,

44:37.717 --> 44:38.548
or 30,000 years,

44:38.634 --> 44:39.795
I will never accept defeat.

44:46.475 --> 44:47.807
The cloud demon is coming.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.636
The cloud demon is coming.

45:08.956 --> 45:09.821
Azi!

45:21.886 --> 45:23.843
Do not close, wait

45:35.024 --> 45:35.684
Get out of here.

45:35.691 --> 45:36.397
Get inside.

45:46.035 --> 45:46.616
Azi!

45:46.786 --> 45:47.492
Don't worry.

45:53.042 --> 45:54.123
Village Chief!

45:55.711 --> 45:56.872
Village Chief!

45:57.171 --> 45:57.911
What happen!

45:58.172 --> 45:59.913
My child's not here!

45:59.924 --> 46:01.040
Who's seen her child?

46:04.720 --> 46:05.927
The child is over there.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.019
Calm down.

46:33.916 --> 46:34.702
Ayue.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.287
When you showed up in my life,

46:38.713 --> 46:41.296
I realized the value of the world.

46:41.757 --> 46:44.124
Even if the Heavenly Kingdom banishes
you to the human world,

46:44.802 --> 46:46.464
But I won't let you face this punishment alone.

46:48.264 --> 46:49.095
I'll go with you.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.617
You are the guardian of the stars.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.449
You have to stay here,

47:14.123 --> 47:15.204
protect the world

47:17.126 --> 47:18.708
and the stars.

47:19.128 --> 47:20.710
The only thing I want to protect is you.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.925
Run!

47:30.848 --> 47:31.463
Give him here.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.091
You can't go out there.

47:47.656 --> 47:48.612
Do you remember

47:48.991 --> 47:50.732
the meteorite I gave you?

47:51.952 --> 47:53.284
As long as we have the meteorite,

47:54.330 --> 47:55.366
no matter where I go,

47:56.290 --> 47:57.747
I will always remember you.

48:14.934 --> 48:15.640
Damn monkey!

48:31.992 --> 48:32.778
Azi!

48:32.910 --> 48:34.367
My magic weapon can stop it.

48:34.620 --> 48:35.906
Fire it. Now. Now!

49:16.537 --> 49:17.448
Ayue.

49:28.090 --> 49:29.080
My Lady,

49:29.341 --> 49:30.582
the enchanted bridge has been destroyed

49:30.885 --> 49:32.296
and Azi fell off it.

49:32.303 --> 49:36.013
The enchanted storm wreaked havoc
upon the Destiny Astrolabe.

49:36.557 --> 49:37.547
As soon as we get it working again,

49:37.766 --> 49:40.224
we will do everything we can to find her.

49:40.561 --> 49:41.517
Also,

49:41.520 --> 49:43.762
the Lord is looking into this matter.

49:59.705 --> 50:00.616
Stop struggling.

50:01.165 --> 50:02.121
You don't even have your powers.

50:02.249 --> 50:03.490
You can't get out of that rope.

50:06.962 --> 50:07.793
Let me out.

50:07.796 --> 50:08.582
How can I let you out?

50:08.797 --> 50:10.004
I'm tied up myself.

50:13.469 --> 50:14.175
You're awake.

50:14.803 --> 50:16.044
You damned witch, let me go!

50:21.727 --> 50:22.592
Sit!

50:23.395 --> 50:25.011
This is the last of the villagers' grain.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.143
They offer it to thank us.

50:27.149 --> 50:29.015
They believe that we are real immortals

50:29.109 --> 50:31.066
and that we are here to save them.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.566
The cloud demon absorbed all their water supply.

50:33.697 --> 50:35.563
They can't even grow any grain.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.232
Either way, we cannot go back.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.484
And the cloud demon will appear again.

50:40.746 --> 50:41.827
I've decided

50:42.581 --> 50:43.992
that we are going to stay here and save them.

50:47.253 --> 50:47.868
Save them?

50:48.462 --> 50:49.168
Why?

50:50.297 --> 50:50.832
Right.

50:52.007 --> 50:52.747
How?

50:53.175 --> 50:54.040
What's it got to do with you?

50:55.636 --> 50:56.672
They can't be saved

50:56.762 --> 50:58.048
because you immortals decide everything.

50:58.347 --> 50:59.133
If you want to save them,

50:59.265 --> 51:00.346
you have to destroy the Destiny Astrolabe.

51:00.474 --> 51:02.386
That's the only way they
can control their own fate.

51:02.643 --> 51:03.929
Fate is predestined.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.435
No one can change their fate.

51:06.146 --> 51:07.057
Erlang.

51:09.733 --> 51:10.564
You're mad.

51:11.235 --> 51:12.146
You want to be punished again?

51:12.319 --> 51:13.526
Forget it.

51:14.113 --> 51:15.524
We don't even have any powers.

51:15.948 --> 51:17.359
The gold band curse is useless here.

51:17.533 --> 51:18.148
Out of the way.

51:18.284 --> 51:19.274
Where are you going?

51:22.454 --> 51:23.240
Out of the way.

51:23.706 --> 51:24.492
Out of the way.

51:29.753 --> 51:30.789
What are you looking at?

51:32.006 --> 51:32.746
Azi,

51:33.757 --> 51:35.168
One's destiny cannot be denied.

51:38.637 --> 51:40.048
This was Mount Huaguo.

51:40.889 --> 51:41.925
Look at the place.

51:42.683 --> 51:43.969
What exactly can we do?

51:45.102 --> 51:45.762
Mother said

51:46.061 --> 51:47.268
that this place is beyond hope.

51:47.855 --> 51:49.437
But I've seen hope here.

51:51.567 --> 51:53.433
I believe that the Lord will see it, too.

51:54.528 --> 51:55.314
Erlang,

51:56.113 --> 51:57.604
you told me

51:58.032 --> 52:00.024
that no matter where I was, if I wanted it,

52:00.451 --> 52:02.659
you would plant an ocean of flowers for me.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.335
Can you do that for me now?

53:00.803 --> 53:01.543
You're awake.

53:02.179 --> 53:02.919
Ayue.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.432
I've finally found you.

53:11.146 --> 53:13.138
Immortal, I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you.

53:13.482 --> 53:14.598
You saved our village,

53:15.317 --> 53:17.434
but now we have nothing.

53:17.903 --> 53:20.270
That was the last of our water.

53:21.156 --> 53:21.862
I...

53:23.450 --> 53:24.531
You armor,

53:24.910 --> 53:26.651
I mended it.

53:27.204 --> 53:28.490
I hope you don't mind.

53:33.627 --> 53:34.743
This stone...

53:36.088 --> 53:36.794
I've had this stone

53:37.297 --> 53:38.253
since I was young.

53:38.882 --> 53:40.293
Can you please not take it from me?

53:41.468 --> 53:42.208
I'm sorry.

53:52.354 --> 53:54.437
How was it? Was there any?

53:54.773 --> 53:55.854
Was there any water?

53:59.069 --> 54:00.435
There isn't any.

54:00.779 --> 54:01.769
There's nothing.

54:02.614 --> 54:03.980
Naughty Boy, Where have you been?

54:03.991 --> 54:04.947
I've been looking for you everywhere.

54:05.325 --> 54:06.816
I couldn't find you anywhere

54:07.161 --> 54:08.277
stop!

54:08.287 --> 54:09.323
Don't bother me.

54:10.038 --> 54:11.074
That is Fengshou.

54:11.331 --> 54:12.492
He's my son.

54:12.875 --> 54:13.911
That is an immortal.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.493
Let go of me. Let go of me.

54:25.012 --> 54:26.469
This is Mount Huaguo, right?

54:27.306 --> 54:28.763
I really like it here.

54:30.642 --> 54:32.508
Don't tell me that this is Mount Huaguo again.

54:33.771 --> 54:35.763
There isn't even anywhere here
to watch the sunset.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.355
The Heavenly Kingdom took away your sunsets,

54:43.071 --> 54:45.154
so we'll go and take them back.

54:49.661 --> 54:51.527
I'll take care of this scarf for you.

55:04.384 --> 55:05.420
Everyone,

55:05.552 --> 55:06.713
come over here. Come over here.

55:06.887 --> 55:09.880
We've decided to stay
and help you be rid of that demon.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.388
Great!

55:12.267 --> 55:13.678
We've looked into things thoroughly.

55:14.102 --> 55:15.513
The cloud demon absorbed water from the land,

55:15.854 --> 55:17.015
but now it has no more water to absorb

55:17.189 --> 55:19.055
and is consuming the moisture
out of people's bodies.

55:19.191 --> 55:21.558
All we want to know is how to get rid of it.

55:21.777 --> 55:22.688
Right. Right!

55:23.987 --> 55:25.478
Let me have a look. I'll have a look.
I'll have a look.

55:27.199 --> 55:28.280
Quiet!

55:31.537 --> 55:32.698
We cannot waste any time

55:33.080 --> 55:34.491
waiting for it to appear again.

55:35.207 --> 55:36.038
We have to

55:36.583 --> 55:38.245
draw it out and catch it.

55:38.585 --> 55:39.245
How can we catch it?

55:40.003 --> 55:41.084
The best defense is offense.

55:41.547 --> 55:42.458
We will

55:44.925 --> 55:45.665
catch the cloud.

55:45.884 --> 55:46.590
Nonsense.

55:47.302 --> 55:49.134
I have a completely different idea.

55:49.346 --> 55:51.008
The way to get the upper hand over it

55:51.181 --> 55:52.342
is to force it out

55:52.641 --> 55:53.597
and corner it.

55:54.351 --> 55:55.592
Then surround it and attack.

55:55.769 --> 55:57.601
How is that any different from my idea?

55:57.729 --> 55:59.095
I've got a plan. You haven't.

55:59.273 --> 56:00.980
I haven't even told you my plan.
How do you know I don't have one?

56:00.983 --> 56:01.769
Then tell us.

56:01.775 --> 56:02.686
You wouldn't even understand.

56:02.693 --> 56:03.149
Try me.

56:03.235 --> 56:04.351
Why should I tell you?

56:04.361 --> 56:04.817
Whatever.

56:04.820 --> 56:05.355
I'll tell you.

56:05.445 --> 56:06.310
I don't want to hear it.

56:06.446 --> 56:07.311
I'm going to tell you anyway.

56:07.739 --> 56:08.604
Enough!

56:08.866 --> 56:10.152
Be quiet if you don't know what it is.

56:11.785 --> 56:14.118
The cloud demon was an immortal cloud
from the Heavenly Kingdom.

56:14.204 --> 56:15.240
It wandered down here

56:15.372 --> 56:16.954
and began absorbing the resentment
in Mount Huaguo,

56:16.957 --> 56:17.913
which turned it into a demon.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.287
It has taken the thing most
important away from me.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.325
And I want it back.

56:21.795 --> 56:23.081
I can do this alone.

56:24.923 --> 56:26.130
We believe that the immortals

56:26.258 --> 56:27.339
can help us get rid of the demon.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.094
We can't catch it when it's up in the sky

56:32.222 --> 56:33.383
and we have to trick it into coming down

56:33.599 --> 56:35.340
by creating a beautiful sunset scene.

56:35.475 --> 56:36.716
Either we draw it down or we force it down,

56:36.935 --> 56:38.221
we will trap it here,

56:38.228 --> 56:39.344
besiege it

56:39.479 --> 56:40.265
and then catch it.

56:40.606 --> 56:41.312
Well,

56:41.398 --> 56:42.434
creating a sunset

56:42.858 --> 56:43.689
isn't exactly feasible.

56:43.692 --> 56:44.273
Why not?

56:45.110 --> 56:46.066
I've thought it through.

56:46.361 --> 56:47.021
There's nothing here.

56:47.446 --> 56:48.152
All we have is cloth.

56:48.447 --> 56:49.153
So we'll use cloth

56:49.364 --> 56:50.525
to create a sunset scene.

56:51.116 --> 56:51.731
Come on.

56:51.742 --> 56:52.482
OK.

56:57.873 --> 57:00.115
Even if we can draw it down, then what?

57:00.250 --> 57:02.082
Your weapon is pretty effective against
the cloud demon.

57:02.169 --> 57:03.125
But the cloud demon is so big.

57:03.462 --> 57:04.953
We can make a super-sized cannon.

57:05.213 --> 57:06.044
Make a crossbow for me.

57:06.340 --> 57:07.547
Improve its consistency

57:07.549 --> 57:08.539
accuracy

57:08.550 --> 57:09.336
and firing range.

57:09.468 --> 57:10.504
Most importantly, it needs to be light.

57:10.844 --> 57:11.675
It needs to be big!

57:12.262 --> 57:13.924
Huge!

57:16.767 --> 57:17.427
I'll put it here.

57:17.517 --> 57:18.303
OK.

57:18.894 --> 57:20.101
Come on. Let's try it.

57:22.814 --> 57:23.850
This won't do.

57:24.691 --> 57:25.431
It's done.

57:25.734 --> 57:26.474
Is it big enough?

57:26.944 --> 57:27.604
What do you think?

57:27.861 --> 57:28.647
Looks good, right?

57:30.155 --> 57:30.736
It's not big enough.

57:32.658 --> 57:33.364
It's not light enough.

57:34.368 --> 57:35.449
I want a big one.

57:43.210 --> 57:44.872
How can we catch the cloud with this cage?

57:46.880 --> 57:47.791
So that's it.

57:48.465 --> 57:49.501
I'm sorry.

57:56.932 --> 57:57.763
Catch the cloud!

57:57.849 --> 57:58.930
Attack the cloud!

57:59.017 --> 57:59.848
Catch the cloud!

57:59.935 --> 58:00.550
Attack the cloud!

58:05.774 --> 58:07.185
Bring it over.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.191
Big enough? Big enough?

58:12.072 --> 58:12.653
It's light enough.

58:13.532 --> 58:14.443
Big enough, right?

58:16.410 --> 58:17.196
Isn't it good?

58:19.830 --> 58:22.243
Let's work together.

58:22.249 --> 58:24.286
Let's make it rain.

58:24.292 --> 58:26.375
Prepare to attack the cloud.

58:27.671 --> 58:30.505
If this saltpeter shell fires,

58:30.716 --> 58:33.003
we'll be able to freeze the cloud demon.

58:35.887 --> 58:36.547
Great!

58:37.472 --> 58:38.132
Great!

58:44.104 --> 58:44.810
Careful.

58:49.317 --> 58:50.023
Next,

58:50.360 --> 58:52.352
we'll arrange all the cloth

58:53.321 --> 58:54.061
just here.

58:54.990 --> 58:56.447
I think it should go

58:56.742 --> 58:57.528
just here.

58:58.618 --> 58:59.153
Just here?

58:59.286 --> 58:59.992
Right.

59:00.662 --> 59:02.995
No. Here.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.127
Wherever you want it.

59:16.470 --> 59:17.210
Come over here.

59:18.013 --> 59:18.753
Come over here.

59:19.598 --> 59:20.338
Come here!

59:21.641 --> 59:23.052
I've got some delicious food.

59:24.394 --> 59:26.477
Everyone in the village

59:27.564 --> 59:29.305
said you were dead.

59:30.317 --> 59:32.479
I told them you weren't.

59:33.278 --> 59:34.439
This is a sweet potato.

59:35.113 --> 59:36.320
Eat it.

59:36.823 --> 59:38.689
Eat.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.165
My son.

59:58.637 --> 59:59.377
Come.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:04.381
Don't open your eyes.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:06.968
One.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:08.640
Two.

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:10.096
Three.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.233
It's beautiful.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.690
There are no stars in the sky here.

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:21.736
From now on,

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.155
you'll be able to see the stars
whenever you open your eyes.

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:19.172
If you like,

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.633
I can make the Heavenly Kingdom
look like the human world:

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:22.710
full of flowers.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:24.761
I'd like that.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:36.016
Heave!

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:37.399
Heave!

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:38.684
Heave!

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:40.736
Heave!

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:42.814
Great!

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:11.224
It's coming!

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:13.390
It's coming!

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.265
It's dark!

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:20.067
Light the fire. Illuminate the sunset.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:23.821
It fell down!

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:25.356
What should we do?

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.901
Cloud attack force, come with me.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:29.618
Quick.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:30.361
Ok!

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:33.997
I'll take the children into hiding.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:35.578
Come. Come with me.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.541
Go.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:45.300
I'll go and get the saltpeter shells.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.477
Sun Wukong, hang in there.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:32.806
I'll help you.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.219
Everyone. Hurry up!

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:36.678
Hurry. Pull!

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:49.569
Hurry. Pull!

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:03.170
Come over here, and get it standing up.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.961
One, two, three!

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:13.467
Hold it.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:15.011
OK. Get going.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.637
Out of the way. I'm aiming at the cloud.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:20.683
Quick.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:26.394
Illuminate the sunset.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.111
Leave this to us.

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:55.135
It's coming.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.261
It's coming.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:58.133
I can't aim at it.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.469
Lift it higher.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.099
Erlang!

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:01.721
Go!

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:17.536
Hurry!

01:05:57.996 --> 01:05:59.112
We caught it!

01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:01.322
We caught it! We caught it!

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:02.698
We caught it!

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.436
It's raining!

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.227
It's finally raining!

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.415
My Lord.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.254
This is all my fault.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.257
This was all an accident.

01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:00.465
The enchanted storm has subdued.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:02.925
The Instrument of Destiny is operating normally.

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:05.053
The balance between heaven
and earth has not been affected.

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:13.894
This time,

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.396
we worked together with

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:16.648
these immortals,

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:18.069
and made it rain.

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:20.200
Everyone must remember their names.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:21.652
OK!

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:25.989
Look.

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:28.204
It's the same as my stone.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.001
This is the other half.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:32.083
Originally they were one meteorite.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:33.626
Do you remember?

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.792
You gave this to me.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:41.763
You told me

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.677
that as long as we had this meteorite,

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.936
you would remember me.

01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:00.274
I'm sorry.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:08.915
It seems that in 200 years

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.498
everything can be forgotten.

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:25.432
Is the past

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.969
really that important?

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:32.305
These last few days

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.231
with you

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:43.651
have been the happiest of my life.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.410
This time you can put it on for me.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:53.292
OK?

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:01.417
Sit down.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.629
What do you have for me today?

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:07.136
It's your favorite, sweet potato.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.765
It's sweet.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.361
I know

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:24.817
that you're not Fengshou.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.953
Fengshou is never coming back.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.997
After you return to the heavens,

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.997
if you see him,

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:37.246
can you tell him not to worry

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:38.830
for me?

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.424
He should be

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:45.337
a great immortal.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.187
To be honest, I envy Fengshou.

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.320
All these years,

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.399
I've never seen my mother.

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:10.658
I want to know

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.249
what she is doing.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.127
I hope one day I can meet her.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:27.383
Don't worry.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:30.048
Fengshou will look after you.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:33.093
OK.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.650
That cloud demon is pretty dumb.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:43.149
This sunset looks pretty fake.

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:45.815
But I like it.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.201
You know this golden band has no power over you,

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.122
why are you still wearing it?

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:05.008
I'm used to it.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:27.064
What's this?

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:28.403
A monkey.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:29.361
A monkey.

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:30.779
That's a dog.

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:33.032
It looks nothing like a monkey.

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:34.537
Monkeys don't look like that.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.451
Give it back.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:11.821
That's right

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:15.995
Although it's not like what it used to be,

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.041
I can feel

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.286
that this is my Mount Huaguo.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:49.609
Let me tell you.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:51.777
Do you know why Sun Wukong, Yang Jian

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:53.658
and Tianpeng look up to me so much?

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:55.239
Because I have a special move

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:57.033
called a thousand fists.

01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:58.489
If everyone gives me five copper coins,

01:12:58.583 --> 01:12:59.915
I'll teach it to you.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:02.830
Do you believe me?

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:04.460
I'll only charge you three copper coins.

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:07.418
OK, free.

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:38.073
Go!

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:38.991
Come over here.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:51.838
Sir, take things easy.

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:02.678
Tianpeng.

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:33.884
You don't have to take it that seriously.

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:38.463
If you want something,

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.133
then come and get it.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.153
Run! Run!

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:01.612
Where are we going?

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.197
She is coming with the celestial warriors.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:05.490
If we don't go now,

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:07.250
everyone will die.

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:08.994
So we have to go.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.287
Go!

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:12.126
What about the villagers?

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:17.836
Stay inside and don't come out.

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:21.715
Run as far as you can.

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:23.012
We managed to defeat the cloud demon,

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.851
and what do we have to fear?

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:33.272
Don't move!

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:36.863
Do you still believe

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:39.156
in my thousand fists?

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.293
Immortal.

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:27.933
How can this have happened?

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.693
Juanlian.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:51.455
See if that kid

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.292
is still alive.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:55.285
Kid?

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.730
The kid is fine.

01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:17.315
Then that's all that matters.

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:24.693
Was my thousand fists

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.242
Really impressive?

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.487
Really.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:39.204
Juanlian.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:42.715
Juanlian.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:51.683
Juanlian.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:09.325
Ayue?

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.252
You have to protect the villagers.

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:23.464
And the stars you made for me.

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:31.340
I just want to be with you.

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:36.987
As an immortal,

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.905
you should feel no desire

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.027
or sense of self.

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:43.164
You must forget your pain

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.457
and perceive life as it is.

01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:48.665
The day you fell down here,

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:52.124
they should have died in this decrepit temple.

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:55.669
You gave them false hope,

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.635
and brought them nothing but more pain in death.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:02.383
We came not for killing

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:04.807
I am here to put an end to this chaos.

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:10.855
Did you really think I didn't know
what you were up to?

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:14.445
I let you go through all this

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.531
Is to let you know

01:23:18.368 --> 01:23:20.860
You changed nothing.

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:12.958
Azi.

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:17.591
We were wrong.

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:20.135
Without permission from the heavens,

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:22.589
those seeds will never flower.

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:29.138
While we were in the village, we were mortals.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.314
He wasn't a demon

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:34.146
and you weren't an immortal.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:38.734
But now you are in the Heavenly Kingdom

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:42.905
and should do as immortals do.

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:48.828
He is locked in a cell at the bottom
of the Destiny Purgatory.

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:52.831
He has endured every possible pain,

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:56.293
but still won't die.

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:00.126
Because he is waiting for you.

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:03.671
Go and beseech him

01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:06.181
to let go.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.822
You came.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.950
I knew you would come.

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:34.331
You kept yourself
from dying purely to tell me that?

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:39.332
I want to say

01:25:40.927 --> 01:25:42.884
that I love the ocean in Mount Huaguo.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.219
Sun Wukong.

01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:50.472
Seeing you like this,

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.554
I realize you are nothing but a handful of dirt.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.016
I hate you.

01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:00.687
I despise you.

01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:10.784
You've lost.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.458
You've lost everything.

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:33.348
Mount Huaguo is gone.

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:36.101
The sky there is covered in darkness.

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:38.190
There is no sunset.

01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:51.283
So this is it.

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:56.288
This is it.

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:16.580
Rest in peace.

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:18.540
I will complete

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:21.001
your mission for you.

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:24.539
Wait for me.

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.423
I will be with you soon.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.981
There has never been an immortal

01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:53.280
that could get this undying heart of the stone.

01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:54.534
You managed it.

01:28:55.705 --> 01:28:56.821
Yang Jian,

01:28:57.374 --> 01:28:58.956
this test

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:02.334
has finally taught you to let go
of your earthly ties.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:06.335
Now, I will help you open your heavenly eye.

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:40.331
After so much hardship,

01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:42.871
you find yourself here again.

01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:46.003
You wanted to seek revenge for Mount Huaguo

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:48.123
and defeat the immortals.

01:29:50.468 --> 01:29:52.380
Did you do it?

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:57.677
I could not.

01:29:58.518 --> 01:30:00.134
Mount Huaguo is gone.

01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:02.177
The heart of the stone is gone.

01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:04.389
Everything is predestined.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:07.270
I lost.

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:11.104
Feeling powerless

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.526
is just the start of your awakening.

01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:18.286
Do you really think there was no way left for you?

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:20.909
Do you accept your fate?

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:25.873
Or will you continue to fight
for what's in your heart?

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:35.712
No matter how powerful

01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:37.425
the heart of the stone is,

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:41.342
it is still part of the Heavenly Kingdom.

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:46.397
Using it to topple its power will never work.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:50.192
You still haven't found the weapon you need.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.736
Think about the life you have spent,

01:30:56.326 --> 01:30:58.158
whom you have met,

01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:02.155
and everything that you refuse to let go of.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.041
Now you have

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:09.291
a power that the Heavenly Kingdom
has never witnessed.

01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:56.443
Great Sage, Equal of Heaven

01:32:58.364 --> 01:32:59.571
We are demons.

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:02.362
Take me to the heavens.

01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:49.997
I am entrusted by the Lord
with protecting the Palace of Destiny.

01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:52.582
Who dares to cause trouble here?

01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:53.625
Show yourself!

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:50.140
Who are you?

01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:52.552
Who exactly are you?

01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:55.183
For the rest of your lives

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:57.814
you will remember my name.

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:06.239
My name is...

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:08.233
The Great Sage, Equal of Heaven.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:11.282
Sun

01:35:11.998 --> 01:35:12.613
Wu-

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:14.198
kong!

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.132
I really can't tell the difference
between any of you.

01:35:24.219 --> 01:35:24.709
Either way,

01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:27.760
whoever you are,

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:30.969
shouldn't even think about
getting out of here alive.

01:37:16.706 --> 01:37:17.617
It seems

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:19.115
you finally understand.

01:37:26.883 --> 01:37:28.670
All of them died.

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:30.835
You call it fate.

01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:32.965
All must comply.

01:37:34.349 --> 01:37:36.591
It turns out that you are the only one
who can control your destiny.

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:39.593
You have so much blood on your hands

01:37:39.729 --> 01:37:42.346
in the name of balancing the heavens
and the earth.

01:37:43.274 --> 01:37:44.355
But all you ever wanted

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:46.772
was Sun Wukong's heart of the stone.

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:49.228
You wanted it to increase your power

01:37:49.322 --> 01:37:51.279
and continue your rule.

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:57.111
And now you want to turn Erlang
into someone like you.

01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:58.657
I will not let that happen!

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:25.601
You came.

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.022
Let go.

01:39:18.744 --> 01:39:21.031
I told you to let go.

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:24.365
Why do you always have to go against me?

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.367
I've told you

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:29.578
that I could kill you

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:31.413
any time I wanted to.

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:08.913
You know that you can change nothing.

01:40:09.754 --> 01:40:12.337
Why are you all here seeking your deaths?

01:40:12.548 --> 01:40:14.039
I'm not like you.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.758
I can't spend my life alone.

01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:52.915
How come you came back looking like a dog?

01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:56.882
This is what I've always looked like.

01:40:58.886 --> 01:40:59.842
I'm ugly, right?

01:41:00.763 --> 01:41:02.595
I like you like this.

01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:05.886
You look so cute.

01:41:14.068 --> 01:41:15.809
In the future I'll be your servant.

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.279
In the future

01:41:24.954 --> 01:41:26.320
you will be free.

01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:29.698
No one will force you to do anything.

01:41:30.293 --> 01:41:32.785
You can do whatever you like.

01:41:34.797 --> 01:41:37.460
Then I will take you to Mount Huaguo
to watch the sunset.

01:42:07.997 --> 01:42:09.329
What's that noise?

01:43:28.994 --> 01:43:30.781
The Heavenly Kingdom took away your sunsets,

01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:34.448
so we'll go and take them back.

01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:38.501
I can feel

01:43:38.713 --> 01:43:40.670
that this is my Mount Huaguo.

01:44:09.618 --> 01:44:10.734
Is the past

01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:14.742
really that important?

01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:18.500
These last few days with you

01:44:19.462 --> 01:44:21.624
have been the happiest of my life.

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:39.575
What Yang Jian's eyes could see
in the past was a fabrication.

01:47:40.079 --> 01:47:42.196
Now, his heavenly eye has opened.

01:47:42.456 --> 01:47:43.913
Give up all emotions

01:47:43.999 --> 01:47:45.706
All he can see are the heavens and the earth.

01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:48.622
You cannot defeat the power
of the heavens and the earth.

01:47:49.797 --> 01:47:51.254
The heavens want to suppress me,

01:47:52.091 --> 01:47:53.457
so I'll cleave the heavens.

01:47:53.676 --> 01:47:54.541
The earth wants to stop me,

01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:56.543
so I'll crush the earth.

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:55.253
Finally you realize

01:49:56.632 --> 01:49:58.794
your true power.

01:50:49.434 --> 01:50:51.596
Why can't you still let go?

01:50:52.104 --> 01:50:54.721
Why can't you understand your destiny?

01:50:58.068 --> 01:50:59.559
Quit lying.

01:51:00.696 --> 01:51:02.437
This is your destiny.

01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:05.149
Not mine.

01:51:26.805 --> 01:51:27.921
The Heavenly Kingdom is in chaos.

01:51:28.015 --> 01:51:29.347
The immortals are incompetent.

01:51:30.017 --> 01:51:31.428
Redefining order between the heavens and the earth

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:33.510
is my true destiny.

01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:35.599
Your vain obsessions

01:51:35.731 --> 01:51:37.973
are nothing but betrayals.

01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:02.168
I know the wrath of the heavens.

01:52:02.633 --> 01:52:03.999
But do you know

01:52:04.134 --> 01:52:05.124
the heavens

01:52:06.261 --> 01:52:07.422
may tremble?

01:54:38.121 --> 01:54:39.828
Sun Wukong.

01:54:41.833 --> 01:54:43.825
Even by defeating the Destiny Astrolabe,

01:54:45.087 --> 01:54:46.828
there is nothing you can change.

01:54:49.758 --> 01:54:51.124
I came,

01:54:53.178 --> 01:54:54.635
I fought

01:54:56.139 --> 01:54:57.801
and I care not about the consequences.

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:03.098
Today, Azi saved you.

01:55:05.357 --> 01:55:06.848
But from now on,

01:55:12.322 --> 01:55:13.563
I am a god

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:15.906
and you are a devil.

01:55:17.077 --> 01:55:18.739
I will always seek your destruction.

01:55:30.632 --> 01:55:32.464
The next time we meet,

01:55:36.096 --> 01:55:37.507
don't hold anything back.

01:55:56.158 --> 01:55:58.400
The heavenly scriptures record
the event like this:

01:55:58.702 --> 01:56:01.695
Her Lady and the devil revolted
in the Heavenly Kingdom,

01:56:01.997 --> 01:56:04.080
and were decried as demons.

01:56:04.791 --> 01:56:06.623
Yang Jian helped to remove the evil,

01:56:06.710 --> 01:56:09.248
and was promoted to the First General
of the Heavenly Southern Gate

01:56:09.963 --> 01:56:11.955
and entrusted with cleansing the three realms.

01:56:13.341 --> 01:56:15.799
The monkey returned to Mount Huaguo

01:56:15.927 --> 01:56:17.213
with the desire to see the purple sunsets there.

01:56:18.138 --> 01:56:20.676
He called upon all living creatures
that refused to accept their fate

01:56:21.183 --> 01:56:24.017
to engage in a hundred years' war
with the Heavenly Kingdom.

01:56:25.479 --> 01:56:26.686
Who is the monkey?

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:28.353
It's me.

01:56:29.232 --> 01:56:29.938
I am

01:56:30.317 --> 01:56:30.977
Sun

01:56:31.526 --> 01:56:32.186
Wu-

01:56:32.986 --> 01:56:33.476
kong!

01:56:34.529 --> 01:56:37.112
(I want the sky no longer to blind my eyes)

01:56:37.449 --> 01:56:40.192
(I want the earth no longer to bury my heart)

01:56:40.535 --> 01:56:43.118
(I want all the living beings to understand my mind)

01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:46.163
(I want all the gods)

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:49.163
(to disappear)
