SIMON: This country is full
of talent in every walk of life.

00:31.142 --> 00:33.349
AMANDA: Britain's Got Talent
is the only show

00:33.350 --> 00:37.941
that finds people with ordinary jobs
that have extraordinary talents.

00:37.942 --> 00:39.981
Is everything all right
with your meals?

00:39.982 --> 00:42.782
DAVID: Every year, somebody
comes along and surprises us

00:42.783 --> 00:45.261
and it's always the last person
you'd expect.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.981
This is it, chaps.
Britain's Got Talent. Good luck.

00:47.982 --> 00:50.902

The boss is finally here.
LAUGHTER

00:56.423 --> 00:58.782
# No matter how hopeless

00:58.783 --> 01:01.143
# No matter how far

01:02.183 --> 01:04.462
# To fight for the right

01:04.462 --> 01:07.782
# Without question or pause

01:07.783 --> 01:10.581
# To be willing to march into hell

01:10.582 --> 01:13.301
# For a heavenly cause

01:13.302 --> 01:14.822
SIMON: I love you

01:14.823 --> 01:16.501
# And I know

01:16.502 --> 01:18.902
# If I'll only be true

01:18.903 --> 01:21.463
# To this glorious quest

01:23.303 --> 01:25.261
# That my heart

01:25.262 --> 01:28.221
# Will lay peaceful and calm

01:28.222 --> 01:31.221
# When I'm laid to my rest...

01:31.222 --> 01:33.421
I actually work right here.

You work in the Lowry?
At the Lowry Theatre.

# To fight

02:08.943 --> 02:11.501
# The unbeatable foe

02:11.502 --> 02:12.981
Guys, it's all yours.

02:12.982 --> 02:13.981

02:13.982 --> 02:15.501

02:24.662 --> 02:26.381
Please tell me your names.

02:26.382 --> 02:28.982
My name's David.
And my name's Darren.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.221
And do you have day jobs?

02:30.222 --> 02:32.381
We do. I'm a food service assistant.

02:32.382 --> 02:34.902
And Darren's a
food service assistant.

02:34.903 --> 02:37.582
You could've just said, "We're both
food service assistants".

02:37.583 --> 02:39.463
LAUGHTER
It would've saved time.

02:40.782 --> 02:42.661
And where are you from,
David and Darren?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.902
We're from Belfast.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Get in

02:44.903 --> 02:45.941
LAUGHTER

02:45.942 --> 02:47.462
Get into who, darling?

02:47.463 --> 02:48.710
LAUGHTER

02:48.712 --> 02:51.031
What's the relationship between
the two of you?

02:51.032 --> 02:52.551
We are a couple

02:52.552 --> 02:54.752
and we've been together
for ten years now.

02:54.753 --> 02:57.072
Congratulations.
APPLAUSE

02:57.073 --> 03:00.352
David and Darren, Dance Dynamics,

03:00.353 --> 03:02.673
we're all rooting for you.
Thank you.

03:07.112 --> 03:08.432
I hope they're good.

MUSIC: '5, 6, 7, 8' by Steps.

03:41.913 --> 03:44.672
MUSIC: 'The Way We Are'
by Alesha Dixon.

03:44.673 --> 03:46.112
It's my song.

03:51.992 --> 03:53.832
What a tune

04:02.872 --> 04:04.992
Oi, I was enjoying that

04:08.673 --> 04:10.151
DAVID: My goodness me.

04:10.152 --> 04:12.672
You fused a lot of things
together there, hadn't you?

04:12.673 --> 04:16.591
We fused Ballroom, Latin,
Line, Irish.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.551
What?
LAUGHTER

04:18.552 --> 04:21.672
Alesha?
David, you forgot half the steps.

04:21.673 --> 04:23.111
LAUGHTER

04:23.112 --> 04:26.192
I didn't like the dancing but
you've got great taste in music.

04:26.193 --> 04:27.392
LAUGHTER

04:27.393 --> 04:30.432
I don't think this is something we
can put in front of the Royal family

04:30.433 --> 04:31.952
cos it just wasn't good enough.
No.

04:31.953 --> 04:34.151
I hope you had a nice time.
We did.

04:34.152 --> 04:36.152
That's the main thing.
Er, we didn't.

04:37.393 --> 04:39.432
No, without being rude,
it wasn't dance.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.192
Secondly, it wasn't dynamic.

04:41.193 --> 04:44.072
And the track, oh, my God,
what was that?

04:44.073 --> 04:46.072
The last one?
Yeah, what was it?

04:46.073 --> 04:47.193
LAUGHTER

04:48.193 --> 04:50.671
I thought my song sounded terrific,
personally.

04:50.672 --> 04:52.952
Thank you for coming.
Let me kick this off with a no.

04:52.953 --> 04:56.112
It's a no from me.
BOTH: OK.

04:56.113 --> 04:58.031
Congratulations, guys. Four nos.

04:58.032 --> 05:00.831
APPLAUSE

05:00.832 --> 05:03.472

You've put a smile on all our faces.

05:05.753 --> 05:07.952
Ah, he took it well.
Yeah.

05:07.953 --> 05:09.512
Did you enjoy yourself?
I did.

05:09.513 --> 05:12.632
You had a smile on your face
all the way through.

05:12.633 --> 05:13.872
SIMON: Thank you.

05:13.873 --> 05:16.711
That was my first job. A runner.

05:16.712 --> 05:18.512
Did you literally make cups of tea?

05:18.513 --> 05:20.711
I had to be there
at five in the morning

05:20.712 --> 05:22.911
and get them their breakfast.
How did you do that?

05:22.912 --> 05:24.432
I loved it.

05:24.433 --> 05:26.633
Off you go. On the star.
Have fun out there.

05:31.232 --> 05:32.952
Hello.
Hello.

05:32.953 --> 05:34.711
What's your name and where you from?

05:34.712 --> 05:37.432
My name's Rob King and I'm from
lovely, sunny Manchester.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.872
CHEERING

05:38.873 --> 05:40.031
How old are you, Rob?

05:40.032 --> 05:42.992
I'm 28 years old.
Do you have a day job?

05:42.993 --> 05:46.552
I actually work right here
at the Lowry Theatre.

05:46.553 --> 05:48.271
Oh, you do?
I do, yeah.

05:48.272 --> 05:50.952
I work in the bar and restaurant,

05:50.953 --> 05:53.112
waiting tables, pulling pints.

05:53.113 --> 05:54.992
And I miss everything that happens
in here.

05:55.245 --> 05:57.523
In fact, the only time I've been
on this stage,

05:57.524 --> 06:00.244
I was handing out boxes of noodles
for a party.

06:00.245 --> 06:02.644
Really? Aw
Yeah.

06:02.645 --> 06:06.204
Were you working today?
No. Well, I was supposed to...

06:06.205 --> 06:07.804
I was supposed to be.
LAUGHTER

06:07.805 --> 06:10.403
Where's your boss?
I think he's somewhere up there.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.723
Oh, my goodness.

06:11.724 --> 06:13.684
So you've got a good boss?
Yeah, I do.

06:13.685 --> 06:15.083
What's their name?
Mike.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.523
Thanks, Mike.

06:17.524 --> 06:19.685
The stage is yours. Thank you.
Go for it.

06:36.005 --> 06:38.644
# Waking in the rubble

06:38.645 --> 06:41.923
# Walking over glass

06:41.924 --> 06:44.843
# Neighbours say we're trouble

06:44.844 --> 06:47.884
# Well, that time has passed

06:47.885 --> 06:50.444
# Peering from the mirror

06:50.445 --> 06:53.603
# No, that isn't me

06:53.604 --> 06:56.283
# A stranger getting nearer

06:56.284 --> 07:00.204
# Who can this person be?

07:00.205 --> 07:04.564
# You wouldn't know me at all

07:04.565 --> 07:07.644
# Today

07:07.645 --> 07:11.004
# From the fading light I fly

07:11.005 --> 07:13.923
# Rise like a phoenix

07:13.924 --> 07:15.963
# Out of the ashes

07:15.964 --> 07:20.163
# Seeking rather than vengeance

07:20.164 --> 07:23.764
# Retribution, you were warned

07:23.765 --> 07:26.444
# Once I'm transformed

07:26.445 --> 07:32.444
# Once I'm rebo-o-o-o-o-orn

07:32.445 --> 07:37.244
# I rise up to the sky

07:37.245 --> 07:39.365
# You pull me down but

07:40.524 --> 07:44.724
# I'm gonna fly-y-y-y-y-y-y

07:46.044 --> 07:48.004
# And rise like a phoenix

07:48.005 --> 07:49.804
Go on
Whoa

07:49.805 --> 07:51.523
# Out of the ashes

07:51.524 --> 07:55.804
# Seeking rather than vengeance

07:55.805 --> 07:59.403
# Retribution, you were warned

07:59.404 --> 08:02.324
# Once I'm transformed

08:02.325 --> 08:05.043
# Once I'm reborn

08:05.044 --> 08:07.843
# You know I will rise

08:07.844 --> 08:10.325
# Like a phoenix

08:11.404 --> 08:13.644
# But you're my

08:13.645 --> 08:18.164
# Fla-a-a-a-a-a-a-ame

08:25.805 --> 08:27.685
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

08:43.245 --> 08:45.604
That's how you do it

08:45.605 --> 08:47.803
Good for you, Rob.
David, what did you think?

08:47.804 --> 08:49.283
Well, you know what, Rob?

08:49.284 --> 08:51.244
I used to work in the theatre
as well.

08:51.245 --> 08:55.163
Every single person who was working
there wanted to be on the stage

08:55.164 --> 08:57.124
or connected to the theatre
in some way.

08:57.125 --> 08:58.923
A lot of those people
never got a chance.

08:58.924 --> 09:01.563
And I'm so pleased
that this show exists

09:01.564 --> 09:03.364
and you walked onto the stage today.

09:03.365 --> 09:06.884
Because, my goodness me,
you deserved this chance.

09:06.885 --> 09:09.043
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:09.044 --> 09:11.444
It was incredible. It was electric.

09:13.284 --> 09:15.604
The second you opened your mouth,
I said to Simon,

09:15.605 --> 09:17.644
"Oh, my God, he's got
a really great voice."

09:17.645 --> 09:19.844
There were moments
when you went a bit pitchy

09:19.845 --> 09:21.403
but I didn't give a damn in the end

09:21.404 --> 09:23.323
because I wanted you to have
that moment

09:23.324 --> 09:25.203
and you had an amazing time.

09:25.204 --> 09:26.764
And you gave us a fantastic time.

09:26.765 --> 09:28.283
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:28.284 --> 09:30.163
Yeah, you know what I love
about this?

09:30.164 --> 09:32.484
It's like we're in a movie
right now. Yes

09:32.485 --> 09:35.163
You know?
Where the guy who's been backstage,

09:35.164 --> 09:39.203
looking at people and thinking,
"OK, I'm gonna take a risk.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.124
I'm gonna do a huge song.
Is it gonna work?"

09:42.125 --> 09:45.884
And I think it's a huge compliment
for me to say to you,

09:45.885 --> 09:48.644
you should be in the West End...
APPLAUSE

09:48.645 --> 09:53.244
Thank you. You've got this amazing
charisma and energy.

09:53.245 --> 09:56.484
And it couldn't be a better title.
You rose like a phoenix. You did it.

09:56.485 --> 09:59.084
Thank you.
I think I'm more nervous now.

09:59.085 --> 10:00.484
ALESHA: They said it all.

10:00.485 --> 10:03.084
I hope this is the start of
something brilliant for you, Rob.

10:03.085 --> 10:05.964
It was a great audition.
I'm gonna kick this off with a yes.

10:05.965 --> 10:07.203
Thank you.

10:07.204 --> 10:09.403
I'm saying yes
Thank you.

10:09.404 --> 10:11.004
It's a yes from me.

10:11.005 --> 10:13.203
I'm gonna work out...
How many people are here?

10:13.204 --> 10:14.403
1,600.

10:14.404 --> 10:16.443
Oh.
LAUGHTER

10:16.444 --> 10:20.443
But including us, it's 1,604 yeses.

10:20.444 --> 10:22.403
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Thank you so much.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.005
Thank you.

10:43.204 --> 10:45.204
MUSIC: 'Lose Yourself' by Eminem.

10:51.164 --> 10:53.485
I can't believe it
We're in London

10:55.804 --> 10:57.604
2,000 people in the Palladium today.

10:57.605 --> 10:59.765
That's a lot of people.
It's a lot of people.

11:01.485 --> 11:04.443
You'll be fine. I hope so.
You're gonna do great.

11:04.444 --> 11:06.844
It's such an opportunity.
You've got one chance.

11:06.845 --> 11:09.403
This is our moment.
We have to take it.

11:09.404 --> 11:11.684
We're not gonna get
another chance like this.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.563
Let's get you on and do it.

11:17.564 --> 11:20.005
Come on, Jay. It's all yours.
Go for it.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.764
Hello
Hello.

11:31.765 --> 11:34.084
How are you?
I'm very good, thank you.

11:34.085 --> 11:36.484
A little nervous, if I'm honest.
That's all right.

11:36.485 --> 11:39.124
What is your name?
My name is Jay.

11:39.125 --> 11:42.163
And how old are you, Jay?
I'm 25. OK.

11:42.164 --> 11:45.364
Now, is what you're going to do
your full-time job?

11:45.365 --> 11:47.403
Erm, I'm a performer full-time.

11:47.404 --> 11:50.765
So I do magic, juggling,
balancing things on my face.

11:52.005 --> 11:54.323
So why have you come onto
Britain's Got Talent?

11:54.324 --> 11:57.004
Because I want to attempt to break
a Guinness World Record.

11:57.005 --> 11:59.764
Ah This, we like already.

11:59.765 --> 12:01.323
So what is the record?

12:01.324 --> 12:04.604
The most chairs balanced on the chin
at the same time.

12:04.605 --> 12:06.364
Oh
Wow.

12:06.365 --> 12:07.884
Yeah!
What?

12:07.885 --> 12:09.724
What is the current record?

12:09.725 --> 12:13.203
Well, when I applied for this,
the current record was five chairs.

12:13.204 --> 12:15.403
So I trained really hard
to be able to do six.

12:15.404 --> 12:18.203
They told me that an American
had broken the record

12:18.204 --> 12:21.364
and the new record is nine chairs.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.923
Oh
Oh, my goodness me.

12:22.924 --> 12:24.604
So I have with me 11 chairs

12:24.605 --> 12:26.803
and I'm gonna try and
bring it back to the UK.

12:26.804 --> 12:28.364
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Yes

12:28.365 --> 12:30.125
That is what we like to hear, Jay

12:31.965 --> 12:35.203
Is there someone here from the
World Record Association?

12:35.204 --> 12:37.203
We have Mark from
Guinness World Records.

12:37.204 --> 12:40.124
Ah
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

12:40.125 --> 12:42.683
So, do you want to take over now?

12:42.684 --> 12:44.884
Well, while he's
talking that through,

12:44.885 --> 12:47.084
my dad Steve is gonna help me
set this up.

12:47.085 --> 12:48.443
Good luck, Dad.

12:48.444 --> 12:50.124
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Hey, Steve

12:50.125 --> 12:51.803
His dad. Not my dad.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.605
Are you brothers?
Is he your brother?

12:55.605 --> 12:56.964
Let's go.

12:56.965 --> 12:59.844
So this is an official
Guinness World Records attempt

12:59.845 --> 13:02.964
for the most chairs
balanced on the chin.

13:02.965 --> 13:05.244
Now, in order to qualify
for this record,

13:05.245 --> 13:07.644
each of the chairs has to be
commercially available

13:07.645 --> 13:09.604
and a full-sized adult chair.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.484
Once they are placed,

13:11.485 --> 13:15.163
they must remain balanced
on the chin with no touching

13:15.164 --> 13:18.284
for a minimum of ten seconds.

13:19.444 --> 13:23.964
The time will begin when Jay
removes his hands from the chairs.

13:23.965 --> 13:26.844
If his hands touch the chairs
during the attempt,

13:26.845 --> 13:29.845
the time will stop and restart
when his hands come off.

13:31.324 --> 13:33.203
And finally, if the chairs fall,

13:33.204 --> 13:36.724
or if he fails to keep them
balanced for ten seconds,

13:36.725 --> 13:39.324
then the attempt will be
disqualified.

13:41.204 --> 13:42.884
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

13:42.885 --> 13:44.604
Take your time.

13:44.605 --> 13:45.804
Take your time, guys.

13:47.885 --> 13:49.605
Let's do this.

13:51.924 --> 13:53.803
Ready? Up.

13:53.804 --> 13:55.444
OK. Got it. Got it.

13:59.085 --> 14:00.404
Oh, I can't watch.

14:01.605 --> 14:04.725
No way!

14:05.725 --> 14:06.845
Ten seconds, remember.

14:16.005 --> 14:17.403
ALL: Five, four,

14:17.404 --> 14:19.323
three, two,

14:19.324 --> 14:20.684
one!

14:21.965 --> 14:23.044
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

14:24.204 --> 14:25.365
I think he's done it

14:34.645 --> 14:36.964
I can confirm that you are

14:36.965 --> 14:39.484
a brand-new Guinness World Records
title holder

14:39.485 --> 14:40.804
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

14:43.765 --> 14:45.125
Yeah

14:46.444 --> 14:49.004
Yes, yes, yes, yes

14:49.005 --> 14:51.803
Amazing.
Wow

14:51.804 --> 14:53.084
Jay

14:53.085 --> 14:56.203
You are a world record breaker

14:56.204 --> 14:57.404
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

14:59.924 --> 15:03.284
There was a danger element to that
which we haven't seen before.

15:05.765 --> 15:08.845
You risked your life and you got
a world record. Congratulations.

15:10.044 --> 15:11.524
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

15:12.684 --> 15:15.403
I'm gonna kick this off with a yes

15:15.404 --> 15:18.004
It's a yes from me.
It's a yes from me.

15:18.005 --> 15:20.764
Obviously, four yeses.
Congratulations.

15:20.765 --> 15:22.324
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

15:25.804 --> 15:28.764
That way. That way.

15:28.765 --> 15:30.005
That way.

15:32.324 --> 15:35.323
Well done. Well done.
Congratulations, man.

15:35.324 --> 15:38.084
He's just happy, isn't he?
So happy.

15:38.085 --> 15:41.244
Jay, that was incredible.
Well done and congratulations.

15:41.245 --> 15:43.484
See you next time for 12 chairs?

15:43.485 --> 15:46.124
12 chairs. See you then.
Well done, mate.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.484
Thank you very much.

15:48.485 --> 15:49.964
What a day we're having.

15:49.965 --> 15:53.324
Lots of yeses and
a world record broken.

15:57.365 --> 15:59.844
How you doing? How are you?
I'm a little bit nervous.

15:59.845 --> 16:01.803
Yeah? A little bit.
How can we help?

16:01.804 --> 16:03.125
I don't know.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.523
My name's Graeme, I'm 34 years old

16:08.524 --> 16:12.684
and I am a comedian comedy person.

16:14.085 --> 16:17.323
I realised at a really early age
I wanted to be an entertainer.

16:17.324 --> 16:20.283
While my mates were all getting
degrees, I was doing Agadoo.

16:20.284 --> 16:21.485
You know what I mean?

16:23.444 --> 16:25.484
I'm auditioning
for Britain's Got Talent

16:25.485 --> 16:27.203
because it's now or never, isn't it?

16:27.204 --> 16:29.884
I've been thinking about it
for years, I've never done it

16:29.885 --> 16:31.803
and I thought, this year,
I'm gonna do it

16:31.804 --> 16:34.283
and hopefully people will think
that I've got talent.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.724
You just walk out?

16:35.725 --> 16:38.523
Just walk out there and they'll give
you a round of applause.

16:38.524 --> 16:39.764
Watch this. Go on.

16:39.765 --> 16:40.924
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

16:42.485 --> 16:44.803
Hello.
Hello.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.484
Hello
LAUGHTER

16:46.485 --> 16:48.683
What's your name?
My name's Graeme.

16:48.684 --> 16:51.084
Hello, Graeme.
Where are you from, Graeme?

16:51.085 --> 16:53.043
I'm from Essex.
CHEERING

16:53.044 --> 16:54.803
Have you brought anyone with you?

16:54.804 --> 16:56.403
I've got a fiancee and a little girl

16:56.404 --> 16:59.124
but I didn't bring our little girl
cos she's a bit little.

16:59.125 --> 17:00.844
And my fiancee sometimes heckles me.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.044
LAUGHTER

17:03.365 --> 17:05.403
And why Britain's Got Talent now?

17:05.404 --> 17:09.084
Because it's the biggest show
for variety, isn't it?

17:09.085 --> 17:12.723
And it's always been a dream
to be on the Royal Variety Show.

17:12.724 --> 17:15.523
And I've always done entertainment
and made people laugh.

17:15.525 --> 17:17.044
I've never had a break

17:17.045 --> 17:19.723
and I thought I'd give it a go
and this might be my break.

17:19.723 --> 17:21.403
Where would you like this to go?

17:21.404 --> 17:24.284
I'd love to win. I wanna win.

17:24.285 --> 17:26.124
I'm just also concerned...

17:26.125 --> 17:28.923
I've got a habit of getting nervous
and mucking things up.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.683
LAUGHTER
It won't go wrong.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.805
Good luck.

17:35.244 --> 17:37.605
Do I just start then?
Just start.

17:43.045 --> 17:44.884
Hello

17:44.885 --> 17:47.324
My name's Graeme and it's now time
for some magic.

17:47.325 --> 17:49.564
And for my magic tonight,

17:49.565 --> 17:51.364
I am gonna need a
glamorous assistant.

17:51.365 --> 17:53.963
Amanda, could you join me
on the stage?

17:53.964 --> 17:56.443
Let's have a big cheer for Amanda,
everybody

17:56.444 --> 17:57.683
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

17:57.684 --> 17:58.923
BOTH: Woo!

17:58.924 --> 18:00.683
That big enough for you?

18:00.684 --> 18:03.844
What we're gonna do tonight is, me
and Amanda are gonna do some magic.

18:03.845 --> 18:06.564
First of all, I'm gonna start
with a simple magic trick.

18:06.565 --> 18:09.163
I've got some cards here tonight.
I've got a birthday card,

18:09.164 --> 18:10.564
I've got a wedding card,

18:10.565 --> 18:12.524
I've got a get well soon card.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.723
I've got a welcome to your new home
and happy birthday generic.

18:15.724 --> 18:18.003
So I'm gonna place the cards
face down

18:18.004 --> 18:19.723
cos that's what the magicians do.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.963
What one do you want to go for,
Amanda? This one.

18:21.964 --> 18:24.003
Have a look, Amanda.

18:24.004 --> 18:26.644
I will now predict what card...

18:26.645 --> 18:28.964
LAUGHTER
Amanda has picked.

18:33.325 --> 18:35.524
Amanda?
Yeah?

18:35.525 --> 18:37.364
I've forgotten what one it was.

18:37.365 --> 18:39.003
LAUGHTER

18:39.004 --> 18:41.763
Amanda, I've written a word
on a piece of paper just here.

18:41.764 --> 18:44.604
Do you know what the word says?
No. "No". That's correct.

18:44.605 --> 18:45.885
LAUGHTER

18:48.484 --> 18:52.084
And now I have two cups
and a bottle of water.

18:52.085 --> 18:54.284
I'm gonna tip water in that cup
like that.

18:54.285 --> 18:57.324
There's water in that one. I'm gonna
tip water in that cup like that.

18:57.325 --> 18:59.364
A little bit more in that one.
And that one.

18:59.365 --> 19:01.044
And now, before your very eyes,

19:01.045 --> 19:03.844
me and magic Amanda
will make the water disappear.

19:03.845 --> 19:06.044
Amanda, put the cup on your head
like that.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.963
Can you hold that with one hand
for me?

19:07.964 --> 19:10.243
Trust me, Amanda. I am a magician.
LAUGHTER

19:10.244 --> 19:12.044
We're gonna do
the magic water dance.

19:12.045 --> 19:15.243
Ladies and gentlemen, magic water
dance will make the water disappear.

19:15.244 --> 19:17.403
Let's do this. Yeah

19:17.404 --> 19:19.003
Right, OK.

19:19.004 --> 19:20.403
I'll dance first.

19:20.404 --> 19:22.763
You go right foot, right foot.

19:22.764 --> 19:24.443
Left foot, left foot.

19:24.444 --> 19:26.284
You turn around, you face the back,

19:26.285 --> 19:28.443
you bend your knees three times

19:28.444 --> 19:31.324
and then you wiggle your bottom
three times.

19:31.325 --> 19:33.364
Yeah. That'll make the water
disappear.

19:33.365 --> 19:36.003
Your turn. Off you go.
Right foot, right foot.

19:36.004 --> 19:37.884
Left foot, left foot.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.443
Turn around and face the back.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.605
Three knee bends,
three bottom wiggles.

19:44.885 --> 19:46.683
Give her a big cheer, everybody

19:46.684 --> 19:49.483
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

19:49.484 --> 19:51.723
The water dance has made the water
disappear.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.403
Does your cup feel lighter, Amanda?

19:53.404 --> 19:55.604
No. That's a problem.
LAUGHTER

19:55.605 --> 19:56.963
I'll go first. Here we go.

19:56.964 --> 19:59.285
Three, two, one. Yeah

20:00.764 --> 20:02.723
Amanda, trust the magic.

20:02.724 --> 20:07.163
I promise you, if you trust
the magic and believe in the magic,

20:07.164 --> 20:09.644
you will not get wet.

20:09.645 --> 20:12.003
Slowly turn it over.

20:12.004 --> 20:14.604
Do you want me to tip it over
for you?

20:14.605 --> 20:17.204
Go on, Amanda Trust the magic.
No, it feels heavy.

20:19.484 --> 20:21.004
Three, two, one.

20:22.444 --> 20:25.044
That is magic.

20:25.045 --> 20:26.884
Ladies and gentlemen...

20:26.885 --> 20:29.963
Big cheer for Amanda

20:29.964 --> 20:31.683
You were amazing, Amanda.

20:31.684 --> 20:33.805
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

20:37.845 --> 20:39.565
I don't feel quite so nervous now.

20:43.684 --> 20:45.684
Honestly, you've
made me happy today.

20:47.964 --> 20:50.923
My mum would be ashamed
if she knew I was here today.

20:50.924 --> 20:52.244
She thinks I'm in prison.

20:54.924 --> 20:56.524
Thanks.

20:56.525 --> 20:59.403
Well, Graeme, you've just made me

20:59.404 --> 21:02.844
and everyone in this room
incredibly happy.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.723
Oh, thank you.
You just have funny bones.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.964
They're covering a lot of meat,
aren't they?

21:10.565 --> 21:13.963
Yeah, you're actually
a breath of fresh air.

21:13.964 --> 21:15.844
You're naturally witty and funny.

21:15.845 --> 21:18.325
I really, really loved that.

21:21.204 --> 21:22.963
I'm gonna tell you something,
Graeme.

21:22.964 --> 21:24.644
Some people walk on the stage,

21:24.645 --> 21:27.604
and the minute they're on the stage,
the air goes out the room.

21:27.605 --> 21:29.524
And you were the opposite.

21:29.525 --> 21:32.003
There's something about you.
You're very confident.

21:32.004 --> 21:34.324
The minute you switch on the act,
we were in it.

21:34.325 --> 21:37.403
And, most importantly, I think
people are gonna root for you.

21:37.404 --> 21:38.884
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

21:38.885 --> 21:41.084
It was great.
Thank you very much.

21:41.085 --> 21:43.524
You have an amazing personality,
as Simon says.

21:43.525 --> 21:45.124
And you deserve the very best.

21:45.125 --> 21:49.004
So I am going to kick this off
with a big, fat yes.

21:50.404 --> 21:52.364
I'm saying yes.

21:52.365 --> 21:54.125
I'm saying yes

21:55.964 --> 21:58.364
And I'm also saying yes,
so that's four.

21:58.365 --> 21:59.884
Thank you.

21:59.885 --> 22:01.644
Thank you very much.

22:01.645 --> 22:03.805
Thank you for your time.
Shall I go off now?

22:05.845 --> 22:07.524

Yes, Graeme Well done, well done.

22:10.964 --> 22:12.763

We are doing it all.
Shaking the hand. Fist pumping.

22:20.444 --> 22:22.763
Hey, you there. Yes, you.

23:06.325 --> 23:08.364

But we thought we'd have
a bit of fun with them tonight.

We've picked their walk on music

23:13.244 --> 23:14.284
LAUGHTER

23:14.285 --> 23:16.164

24:15.845 --> 24:18.044
there's not many people
that do what I do.

24:18.045 --> 24:19.564
A little bit unique.

24:19.565 --> 24:22.003
Er, you are gonna do
a contortionist...

24:22.004 --> 24:23.923
Not quite. No. Not a contortionist.

24:23.924 --> 24:25.644
Gymnastics?
Almost.

24:25.645 --> 24:28.084
OK. It's contortion,
it's gymnastics.

24:28.085 --> 24:29.683

24:29.684 --> 24:31.243
Modern dance
No.

I fight to be where I am

The two things, to me, didn't seem
to work in perfect unison.

26:53.845 --> 26:57.723
It was a good idea
but it was just a bit boring.

26:57.724 --> 27:01.483
Erm, once you were upside down,
the singing was compromised.

27:01.484 --> 27:05.524
And, yeah... I think you're right.
It just felt a bit slow.

27:05.525 --> 27:08.805
Well, essentially, it was you
climbing up a rope, singing. And...

27:10.085 --> 27:12.084
Er...

27:12.085 --> 27:15.524
That was it.
Tell it as it is, Simon.

27:15.525 --> 27:18.443
David, yes or no?
I'm sorry, it's a no today.

27:18.444 --> 27:20.443
I'm sorry, it's a no.
It's a no from me.

27:30.885 --> 27:32.763
To do well on this show,

27:32.764 --> 27:37.403
you've gotta really smash it
out of the park. I agree.

27:37.404 --> 27:39.443
Ladies? Hello.
How are you?

27:39.444 --> 27:41.084

A big surprise?

Yes.
That sounds great.

27:46.444 --> 27:48.644

Well, welcome.

27:51.404 --> 27:53.243

27:53.244 --> 27:55.844
Because it's the biggest show
in the world.

27:55.845 --> 27:57.604
Say that again.

27:57.605 --> 27:59.364

31:47.764 --> 31:49.644
You know what was
really good about this?

31:49.645 --> 31:51.683
Normally, on a magic act,

31:51.684 --> 31:54.284
mainly it's been guys with a girl

31:54.285 --> 31:56.564
pulling the rabbit out,
blah, blah, blah.

31:56.565 --> 31:58.804
And that is boring,
if I'm being honest with you.

31:58.805 --> 32:02.483
I think what this show is about
is about finding, hopefully, a star.

32:02.484 --> 32:04.963
And I think you have that potential.
Oh, definitely.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.724

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:35.284 --> 39:37.843
How's the teeth? Good.
Are you sure?

39:37.844 --> 39:40.444
Did he feel heavy?
Er...

39:40.445 --> 39:43.363
A little bit, of course.
Yeah, he's a big guy. He's a lump.

39:43.364 --> 39:45.203
That was good, though, right?
Yeah.

39:45.204 --> 39:47.364
You went off the floor
by about that much.

39:49.204 --> 39:50.764
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:55.804 --> 39:59.363
Hello.
What's your name and where you from?

39:59.364 --> 40:01.044
My name's Mark McMullen,

40:01.045 --> 40:03.524
I am 23 and from Northern Ireland.

40:03.525 --> 40:04.844
CHEERING

40:07.284 --> 40:09.163
I presume you're gonna sing for us
today.

40:09.164 --> 40:10.763
I am, yes.
OK.

40:10.764 --> 40:12.803
So what are you going to sing today?

40:12.804 --> 40:15.924
I'm gonna sing Bring Him Home
from Les Miserables.

40:15.925 --> 40:17.723
Oh, I love this song.

40:17.724 --> 40:20.004
And why did you choose that song?

40:20.005 --> 40:24.283
Bring Him Home is a very, very
personal song to me and my family.

40:24.284 --> 40:26.564
About...

40:26.565 --> 40:28.484
Nearly six years ago,

40:28.485 --> 40:31.084
my older brother took sick
from a brain injury.

40:31.085 --> 40:33.204
And... he's here today.

40:34.364 --> 40:36.723
CHEERING
But...

40:36.724 --> 40:40.444
He was left with a condition called
locked-in syndrome. Right.

40:40.445 --> 40:43.803
Which basically means he can't...
He's trapped inside his own body.

40:43.804 --> 40:46.084
And the only thing he can really do
is hear.

40:46.085 --> 40:49.604
So my music kind of became a big...

40:49.605 --> 40:51.803
Comfort for him.
Ah, darling.

40:51.804 --> 40:52.764
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:56.485 --> 40:59.203
Why Britain's Got Talent now?

40:59.204 --> 41:00.964
It just seemed to be the right time.

41:00.965 --> 41:04.604
Everything in my life kind of
lined up at this moment to...

41:04.605 --> 41:08.323
Bring me here. So I just thought,
"What the hell? Just go for it."

41:08.324 --> 41:09.964
So...

41:09.965 --> 41:13.883
Half of me is here today for me
to try and pursue my career in music

41:13.884 --> 41:16.683
and the other half of me is here
to do them proud.

41:16.684 --> 41:19.283
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:19.284 --> 41:20.764
Good for you.

41:22.284 --> 41:24.124
OK. Well, the stage is yours.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.485
Thank you very much.
Good luck. Thank you.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:53.764 --> 43:55.485
Oh, God...

44:17.565 --> 44:21.203
You have the most gorgeous tone
and quality to your voice

44:21.204 --> 44:22.723
and I love your vibrato.

44:22.724 --> 44:27.004
When you listen to the words and you
know the background of your story,

44:27.005 --> 44:30.484
it just made so much sense.
It was so much more poignant.

44:30.485 --> 44:33.004
It was beautifully done.

44:33.005 --> 44:35.683
Well done, you're very talented.
Thank you very much.

44:35.684 --> 44:37.404
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:37.405 --> 44:39.803
Wow. I mean... It was incredible.

44:39.804 --> 44:41.964
Cos you're such a softly spoken guy

44:41.965 --> 44:46.484
and you've got this absolutely
beautiful singing voice.

44:46.485 --> 44:50.323
And you made us listen to
every single word of that song.

44:50.324 --> 44:52.763
And I think you did your brother
very proud today

44:52.764 --> 44:54.243
and you did yourself proud.

44:54.244 --> 44:55.684
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:57.324 --> 45:00.404
For me, it was a very confident,
self-assured performance.

45:00.405 --> 45:02.243
It had a lot of meaning to it.

45:02.244 --> 45:05.363
I think it was a perfect,
brilliant tribute to your brother.

45:05.364 --> 45:06.764
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:08.204 --> 45:09.484
Well done, Mark.

45:09.485 --> 45:11.803
What is your brother's name?
Declan.

45:11.804 --> 45:13.124
Declan? OK.

45:13.125 --> 45:15.284
Well, he's lucky to have a brother
like you.

45:16.844 --> 45:20.124
You brought meaning to that song
which I hadn't thought about before.

45:20.125 --> 45:22.444
I'll tell you what I was really
impressed with, Mark.

45:22.445 --> 45:26.044
Is that you managed to combine
a real tenderness with that song

45:26.045 --> 45:29.283
and then went into the strength on
the second half of the performance.

45:29.284 --> 45:31.683
And I wouldn't be surprised,
off the back of this,

45:31.684 --> 45:35.243
that you start getting calls
from West End producers,

45:35.244 --> 45:37.124
possibly Broadway producers.

45:37.125 --> 45:39.323
Because you're that good.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:39.324 --> 45:42.604
I really like you.
Thank you very much.

45:42.605 --> 45:44.204
Really good.

45:45.485 --> 45:48.283
It gives me pleasure
to kick this off with a yes.

45:48.284 --> 45:51.084
Thank you very much.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:51.085 --> 45:52.364
I'm gonna say yes

45:54.125 --> 45:57.444
It's a yes from me.
Thank you.

45:57.445 --> 46:00.644
You have four big, fat yeses.
Congratulations.

46:00.645 --> 46:02.044
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

46:02.045 --> 46:03.605
Thank you very much.

46:04.844 --> 46:06.164
Thank you.

46:19.925 --> 46:22.604
Yes, Mark How was that?
It was good.

46:22.605 --> 46:26.843
Just good? It was more than good.

46:26.844 --> 46:28.363
Mum.

46:28.364 --> 46:31.044
How are you, brother?

46:31.045 --> 46:33.803
That was very, very, very good.

46:33.804 --> 46:35.243
Declan loves his singing.

46:35.244 --> 46:38.243
Just the sound of music
means an awful lot to him.

46:38.244 --> 46:41.444
Well, I think you'll be hearing
a lot more. Thank you so much.

46:41.445 --> 46:43.324

46:44.724 --> 46:46.484
Well done.
Well done.

46:46.485 --> 46:49.085
Thank you very much.
Say hello to Declan for us. Yes.

46:57.164 --> 46:58.803
It's competition time.

46:58.804 --> 47:01.803
And here's another chance to win a
prize that's not to be missed.

47:01.804 --> 47:05.243

For starters,
we're giving one lucky winner

47:07.445 --> 47:10.323

47:32.844 --> 47:35.125
So for another chance to win
all of this...

48:02.565 --> 48:04.445
Good luck

48:17.324 --> 48:20.524
I've watched this

48:20.525 --> 48:24.763
So now it's just really weird
to actually be here.

48:24.764 --> 48:28.724
Our big dream is to win
Britain's Got Talent.

48:32.125 --> 48:33.804

49:17.844 --> 49:19.723
What would you do with the money
if you won?

49:19.724 --> 49:22.084
I'd buy a mansion.
A mansion?

49:22.085 --> 49:24.363
And a hamster cos it would
wind my mammy up.

49:24.364 --> 49:25.924
LAUGHTER

49:25.925 --> 49:27.924
A mansion and a hamster?
Yeah.

49:27.925 --> 49:30.363
OK. So a little house
for the hamster?

49:30.364 --> 49:32.124
No, a very big one

49:32.125 --> 49:33.843
LAUGHTER

49:33.844 --> 49:36.763
So it's not a hamster mansion,

49:40.684 --> 49:42.085
LAUGHTER
OK.

Everyone else might as well
just pack up and go home.

52:23.284 --> 52:25.044
Cos that was incredible

52:25.045 --> 52:26.445
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

52:28.764 --> 52:32.004
It's a lovely idea that could
run and run and run and run.

52:32.005 --> 52:34.404
Because although you picked
loads of superstars,

52:34.405 --> 52:36.723
there's more to do.
So, fantastic, guys.

52:36.724 --> 52:39.324

53:07.284 --> 53:08.883
I'll tell you what I think, guys.

53:08.884 --> 53:12.163
We've seen a lot of dance acts
and what I judge it on,

53:12.164 --> 53:15.084
because, believe it or not,
I'm not a dance expert.

53:15.085 --> 53:18.124
But what am I gonna remember?

53:18.125 --> 53:20.044
And who has got imagination?

53:20.045 --> 53:22.363
And who has done something
we haven't seen before?

53:22.364 --> 53:24.763
And you tick every box on that.

53:24.764 --> 53:26.724

54:11.485 --> 54:13.203
Anyone for tennis?

54:13.204 --> 54:15.684
What? You are a man of mystery,
aren't you?

54:16.884 --> 54:18.724
You came to set the place on fire.

54:22.244 --> 54:23.844
Not many people can do what you do.

54:27.125 --> 54:30.124
I just think you are
absolutely incredible.

54:30.125 --> 54:32.405
Are you gonna get up?
I don't think I can.

54:33.405 --> 54:35.724
You are what this show is all about.
So thank you.

54:37.925 --> 54:39.445
This could be a bumpy ride.

54:41.045 --> 54:42.363
Ooh

54:42.364 --> 54:45.604
Switch over now to ITV2
for Britain's Got More Talent.

54:45.605 --> 54:47.084
I haven't got a clue either.

54:47.085 --> 54:48.203
Oh, yeah

54:48.204 --> 54:49.564
Mamma mia

54:49.565 --> 54:50.604
Ding, ding.

54:50.605 --> 54:51.724
Here it is again.

54:53.005 --> 54:54.644
Oh

54:54.645 --> 54:56.605
