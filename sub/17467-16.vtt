WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:06.049
Hey.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.312
Oh, hi. Your mom
said I could hang out.

00:08.356 --> 00:11.620
Hang out, hang yourself,
I really don'’t care.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.274
What'’s your problem?

00:13.317 --> 00:16.015
Oh, sorry.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.800
My car broke down,

00:17.843 --> 00:21.847
and I had to walk three miles
in these awful polyester pants.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.588
My thighs almost started a fire.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.547
You want me to look at the car?

00:25.590 --> 00:30.160
Well, I guess technically
it didn'’t break down.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.075
Technically, it ran out of gas.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.946
How does that happen?

00:33.990 --> 00:35.296
There'’s a gauge,
there'’s a light,

00:35.339 --> 00:37.254
some cars go
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.

00:37.298 --> 00:40.953
I know,
I was just riding the zero.

00:40.997 --> 00:45.306
Help me out, is that
a sober thing or a lady thing?

00:45.349 --> 00:47.612
No, it'’s a Plunkett thing.

00:47.656 --> 00:51.094
When my car tells me it'’s out of
gas, I choose not to believe it.

00:51.138 --> 00:54.576
Wow, that'’s, I don't know
what the word is for that.

00:54.619 --> 00:55.838
Maybe... stupid?

00:55.881 --> 00:59.624
I prefer to think of it
as exciting.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.452
A simple trip to
the grocery store

01:01.496 --> 01:03.411
becomes a life and
death adventure.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.891
Yeah, I'’m gonna stick
with stupid.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.459
So you need a
ride somewhere?

01:08.503 --> 01:11.549
Well, I was gonna meet
the girls at the bistro

01:11.593 --> 01:12.724
and go to a meeting.

01:12.768 --> 01:13.769
I'’ll take you.

01:13.812 --> 01:15.031
You sure?

01:15.075 --> 01:17.425
I always have plenty of gas
in my car.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.558
Coward.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.734
[chuckles]

01:22.778 --> 01:25.737
So, how did this "riding
the zero" thing get started?

01:25.781 --> 01:28.871
Well, first of all,
you have to understand,

01:28.914 --> 01:30.742
I used to be really poor.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.222
Worse than now?

01:32.266 --> 01:33.571
'’Cause you steal toilet paper
from work.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.356
You want to hear
the story or not?

01:35.399 --> 01:36.748
Yeah, yeah, okay. Sorry.

01:36.792 --> 01:39.534
One day, my gas tank
was on empty,

01:39.577 --> 01:41.144
but I still had
to get to my job.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.147
So, I just ignored it
and it kept going.

01:44.191 --> 01:47.150
Eight days.
It was like Hanukkah.

01:47.194 --> 01:50.153
You rode the zero
for eight whole days?

01:50.197 --> 01:52.677
Kind of makes you tingle,
doesn'’t it?

01:52.721 --> 01:55.027
You do know that it'’s really bad
for your engine.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.377
You'’re such a man.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.206
How about while
you'’re at the meeting,

01:59.249 --> 02:01.077
I get some gas and
swing by your car,

02:01.121 --> 02:02.687
and put a couple
of gallons in it?

02:02.731 --> 02:04.167
Thank you, Adam.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.603
That'’s so sweet.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.039
My mom completely
does not deserve you.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.086
You'’re not wrong.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.222
So listen, I need a favor.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.571
I'’ve been talking
with a social worker

02:16.614 --> 02:18.355
about my foster care
application,

02:18.399 --> 02:20.357
and I'’m supposed to get letters
of recommendation from friends

02:20.401 --> 02:21.663
saying that I'’d be a good mom.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.012
So, Marjorie, I was wondering

02:23.055 --> 02:24.318
if you would write one for me.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.233
I'’d be happy to, Jill.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.799
Thank you.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.630
I would also be happy
to write one.

02:32.674 --> 02:35.720
Well, we'’ll see how many I need.

02:35.764 --> 02:38.549
[cell phone ringing]

02:38.593 --> 02:42.945
Huh. That'’s a strange number.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.860
Hello.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.949
Yes, this is she.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.298
Yes, I know Christy Plunkett.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.475
Oh, my God, is she all right?

02:51.519 --> 02:52.389
What'’s going on?

02:52.433 --> 02:55.392
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.959
Okay, I'’m on my way.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.222
That was the hospital.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.354
Christy was in a car accident.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.790
What?! Is she okay?Oh, no!

03:01.833 --> 03:03.313
I don'’t know.Come on, I'’ll drive.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.706
Why didn'’t they call me?

03:04.749 --> 03:07.230
Check your phone,
maybe it went to voice mail.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.145
No, nothing.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.103
Oh God, what if she has amnesia
and forgot I'’m her mother?

03:11.147 --> 03:12.366
Then there'’s a silver lining.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.196
♪

03:31.820 --> 03:33.082
I'’m looking
for Christy Plunkett.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.431
She was in a car accident.

03:34.475 --> 03:38.261
Yes, she'’s here.
Are you Marjorie Sponsor?

03:38.305 --> 03:42.961
Actually that'’s me, uh,
Marjorie Armstrong-Perugian.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.572
You took Victor'’s name?

03:44.615 --> 03:46.530
Not now.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.097
Is she okay?

03:48.140 --> 03:49.272
You'’ll have to talk to a doctor.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.839
Excuse me, I'’m her mother.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.014
Why wasn'’t I called?

03:52.057 --> 03:53.798
The EMT'’s checked her phone,

03:53.842 --> 03:57.324
and Marjorie Sponsor
is her emergency contact.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.325
Here'’s your visitor's pass.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.456
Seriously?!

03:59.500 --> 04:01.110
She gets to go in and I don'’t?

04:01.153 --> 04:03.721
I'’m only authorized to admit
the person that'’s on my log.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.462
This is crazy. I'’m her mother.

04:05.506 --> 04:08.030
Not everyone likes their mother.

04:11.555 --> 04:15.472
Oh sweetie, I'’m so
glad you'’re okay.

04:15.516 --> 04:18.822
Get out of my way,
this is police business.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.261
Oh, baby.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.654
Hi, Mom.Are you okay?

04:23.698 --> 04:26.440
The doctor said I have a
concussion, but I'’ll be fine.

04:26.483 --> 04:29.007
Oh, honey, I'’m so relieved,
I was terrified.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.706
One question, why is Marjorie
your emergency contact?

04:31.749 --> 04:33.577
What?

04:33.621 --> 04:35.449
Bonnie, this is
not the time.

04:35.492 --> 04:36.972
You'’re right, you're right.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.104
The important thing
is that you'’re okay.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.105
What happened?

04:40.149 --> 04:41.977
It'’s all kind of fuzzy.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.414
I was going to the bistro and
this car came out of nowhere.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.678
It'’s just weird that
the hospital didn'’t call me.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.072
Am I in your phone
as "Bonnie" or "Mom"?

04:50.115 --> 04:52.640
Great, you'’re all here.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.772
Christy'’s CT scan was
clear so she can go home.

04:54.816 --> 04:55.773
Oh, good.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.253
But she'’ll need rest

04:57.297 --> 04:58.298
and somebody'’s got to
keep an eye on her.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.561
That would be me, her mother.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.954
And while I may not be
her emergency contact,

05:02.998 --> 05:05.957
I will not leave her side until
she'’s completely recovered.

05:06.001 --> 05:09.004
Thanks, Mom.
How'’s Adam?

05:09.047 --> 05:10.310
He'’s fine. Why?

05:10.353 --> 05:13.138
He was driving the car.What?

05:13.182 --> 05:14.966
Oh, no.
JILL: Oh, my God.You didn'’t know that?

05:15.010 --> 05:18.361
No, Wendy, I didn'’t know that
'’cause nobody called me!

05:18.405 --> 05:20.407
He'’s just down the hall.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.323
Go.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.411
You'’re sure?

05:24.454 --> 05:26.456
I'’m surrounded
by doctors and nurses.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.153
I'’m safer here
than I am at home.

05:28.197 --> 05:31.374
I'’ll be right back.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.725
I always forget you have a job.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.510
[Jill laughs]

05:38.468 --> 05:41.123
Oh, my God, are you okay?Oh.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.212
I'’ve been better.
How'’s Christy?
Oh.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.475
She'’s gonna be fine.
What happened?

05:45.519 --> 05:47.434
Guy came out of nowhere,
I never saw him.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.652
Did you break your arm?

05:48.696 --> 05:49.958
No, I just dislocated it.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.568
Oh.

05:51.612 --> 05:52.569
Oh, look who finally showed up.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.572
Danielle?
What are you doing...

05:55.616 --> 05:57.052
What is your ex-wife doing here?

05:57.095 --> 05:59.097
I'’m his emergency contact.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.403
Oh, come on!

06:00.447 --> 06:02.797
[laughs]
[laughs]
Don'’t be upset.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.755
I'’m sure he just never got
around to changing it.

06:04.799 --> 06:08.106
I'’m probably still the voice
on his answering machine.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.456
You told me
that was your mother.

06:09.499 --> 06:12.241
Um... can I have my soda?

06:12.284 --> 06:13.242
Yeah.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.548
I'’ll give it to him.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.726
I just talked to your doctor.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.118
He said they'’re
sending you home soon.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.642
Great, you'’ll come
home with me.

06:21.685 --> 06:24.471
Babe, I'’m gonna need
to go back to my place.
Why?

06:24.514 --> 06:26.864
I'’m down to one
working limb here.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.823
I can'’t even take a shower
in your apartment.

06:28.866 --> 06:31.391
Now, will you be able to stay
with him? He'’s gonna need help.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.697
Damn.
What?

06:33.741 --> 06:35.438
I-I'’ve got to take care
of Christy.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.571
Aw, aren'’t you a good mom?

06:39.137 --> 06:41.183
What'’s that supposed to mean?

06:41.226 --> 06:44.142
D-Don'’t worry, I will
take care of this big lug,

06:44.186 --> 06:45.579
get him back
into fighting shape.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.580
[chuckles]

06:48.103 --> 06:50.279
Is that cool with you?

06:50.322 --> 06:53.456
That your ex-wife
is gonna take care of you?

06:53.500 --> 06:54.805
I'’m super-duper.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.067
Ah.

06:56.111 --> 06:58.461
And you were so sure
she was gonna flip out.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.899
Isn'’t he silly? It's...

07:09.429 --> 07:10.647
You all done?

07:10.691 --> 07:12.475
Yeah.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.608
Oh, you didn'’t eat a lot.

07:14.651 --> 07:15.783
You feeling okay?

07:15.826 --> 07:18.655
I have a headache, I'’m nauseous

07:18.699 --> 07:20.265
and I don'’t remember much.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.833
So, kind of like I'’m 20 again.

07:24.966 --> 07:28.404
But I'’m alone in a bed I
recognize, so that'’s good news.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.495
God, that must'’ve been
so scary for you.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.627
It was.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.280
When I was in the ambulance,

07:35.324 --> 07:37.500
I kept thinking about all
the things I'’ve never done,

07:37.544 --> 07:39.241
all the places
I'’ve never been.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.242
Europe?

07:40.285 --> 07:42.287
Actually, Orlando.

07:45.682 --> 07:48.816
All right, the doctor said
I'’m supposed to ask you

07:48.859 --> 07:50.208
these questions to make sure

07:50.252 --> 07:52.167
you'’re recovering
from the concussion.

07:52.210 --> 07:55.213
Now... what is your name?

07:55.257 --> 07:57.520
Christy Jolene Plunkett.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.305
Okay. What is the
name of this place?

08:02.699 --> 08:05.485
Earth?

08:05.528 --> 08:07.443
I'’ll accept that.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.749
What day of the week is it?

08:08.792 --> 08:09.750
I don'’t know.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.099
I don'’t, either.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.493
And the final question,

08:13.536 --> 08:15.930
why the hell aren'’t I
your emergency contact?!

08:15.973 --> 08:18.019
What?

08:18.062 --> 08:20.717
You programmed Marjorie
into your phone.

08:20.761 --> 08:23.851
I don'’t remember your giant head
poking out of her patooch.

08:23.894 --> 08:27.071
I changed it
when you relapsed,

08:27.115 --> 08:29.334
and I guess I never got
around to changing it back.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.859
Oh. So it used to be me?

08:31.902 --> 08:34.339
Well...
Oh!

08:34.383 --> 08:36.645
Come on, man.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.561
I am great in an emergency.

08:38.605 --> 08:39.780
I'’ll change it, I'll change it.

08:39.823 --> 08:40.998
No, I don'’t want you
to change it

08:41.042 --> 08:42.347
'’cause I made you.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.827
I want you to change it
'’cause you trust me.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.353
I totally trust you.

08:48.397 --> 08:52.357
Good, '’cause I'm not
the person I used to be.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.620
I know that.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.360
And if the people
who used to know me

08:55.404 --> 08:57.537
weren'’t all dead or in
jail, they'’d be amazed.

08:59.451 --> 09:02.106
And yet you'’re alive
and walk free.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.717
What'’s that?

09:03.760 --> 09:04.674
I love you.

09:04.718 --> 09:08.112
I love you, too.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.288
All right then,
I'’m gonna give Adam a call

09:10.332 --> 09:11.376
and see how he'’s doing.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.117
Please tell him I'’m sorry.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.685
None of this would'’ve happened
if I had put gas in my car.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.340
Ah, riding the zero.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.342
Yep.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.517
How many days you get?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.649
Four.

09:22.692 --> 09:26.130
[exhales]
Respect.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.393
Hey, remember when we drove
that old Buick Skylark

09:28.437 --> 09:30.439
from Denver to Salt Lake
with nothing in the tank?

09:30.482 --> 09:33.268
Well, to be fair,
we were going down a mountain.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.922
Mountain my ass,
it was a miracle.

09:46.411 --> 09:49.371
[cell phone ringing]

09:49.414 --> 09:50.546
Adam'’s phone.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.505
Danielle.

09:53.549 --> 09:57.205
Could I please speak with Adam
on Adam'’s phone?

09:57.248 --> 10:00.817
Oh, Adam was right,
you really are a hoot.

10:00.861 --> 10:04.429
Uh, unfortunately,
he'’s sleeping right now.

10:04.473 --> 10:07.737
Uh-huh. So, you gonna head out?

10:07.781 --> 10:09.521
No, we decided that
I should stay tonight, you know,

10:09.565 --> 10:12.046
in case he needs help
using the bathroom or bathing.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.830
Bathing?

10:13.874 --> 10:18.008
He had a car accident,
he didn'’t fall in a mud puddle.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.358
Bonnie, I'’m sleeping
on the couch,

10:20.402 --> 10:22.186
you have nothing to worry about.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.449
[chuckling]: Oh sweetie,
I wasn'’t worried.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.625
Oh, good. Bye-bye.

10:25.668 --> 10:26.713
Wait, I...

10:26.756 --> 10:29.672
Hello?

10:29.716 --> 10:31.979
Damn it.

10:36.810 --> 10:37.941
CHRISTY:
Mom?

10:37.985 --> 10:40.335
Oops. I'’m here, baby!

10:51.694 --> 10:53.000
Hey there, sleepyhead.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.131
Aah...

10:54.175 --> 10:56.133
What are you doing here?

10:56.177 --> 10:57.569
Just taking care of
you while your mom

10:57.613 --> 10:59.093
pees a circle around
her boyfriend.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.877
What?

11:00.921 --> 11:03.314
Okay. Now, I'’ve got some
concussion questions

11:03.358 --> 11:04.968
I'’m supposed to ask you.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.841
What is your name?

11:07.884 --> 11:10.757
Christy Jolene Plunkett.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.149
Your middle name'’s Jolene?

11:12.193 --> 11:13.585
Yes.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.152
Then why the hell
do you go by Christy?

11:15.196 --> 11:17.241
'’Cause Jolene's stupid.

11:17.285 --> 11:21.724
Oh, well I guess my dead
grandma'’s name is stupid then.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.466
Wait, where'’s my mom?

11:24.509 --> 11:26.033
Hey! I'’m asking
the questions here.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.646
What is the name of this place?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.821
Orlando.

11:33.736 --> 11:36.478
So now, where'’s my mom?

11:36.521 --> 11:38.088
She'’s at Adam's. She
asked me to fill in,

11:38.132 --> 11:39.699
which is great, because
it gives me a chance

11:39.742 --> 11:41.701
to use what I'’m learning
in my mommy classes.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.574
Okay.

11:45.617 --> 11:49.273
I don'’t think I like your tone.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.755
I'’m sorry, I just meant that...

11:52.799 --> 11:54.670
I know what you meant.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.716
You still don'’t think
I'’d be a good mother.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.109
No, I'’m just kind of waking up.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.807
I can read between the lines.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.025
What lines?

12:02.069 --> 12:05.637
The lines we draw
when we hurt each other!

12:06.987 --> 12:09.729
I think I might be in danger.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.432
Adam?

12:17.475 --> 12:18.999
ADAM:
It'’s open!

12:19.042 --> 12:20.740
That'’s when you had

12:20.783 --> 12:23.525
that stupid Smokey and the Bandit
mustache.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.789
That was a Magnum mustache
and you loved it.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.748
Hey, baby.

12:28.791 --> 12:31.272
Ah, am I interrupting
happy hour?

12:31.315 --> 12:33.056
Oh, no,
we'’ll just keep drinking.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.060
Danielle made martinis.

12:37.104 --> 12:40.716
I took a pain pill, they say you
shouldn'’t mix them with alcohol,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.674
but they were wrong.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.069
Hey, I know I can'’t get you
one of these,

12:46.113 --> 12:48.289
but would you like something
non-alcoholic,

12:48.332 --> 12:51.727
like, maybe a juice box?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.208
No. Thanks.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.514
I just came to see my boyfriend.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.212
That'’s me.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.346
Okay.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.786
So I'’m assuming
you'’re feeling better.

13:06.829 --> 13:11.094
Oh yeah. I took a nap and then
Danielle gave me a sponge bath.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.792
All of you?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.619
Oh, relax, I mean, it'’s not like

13:14.663 --> 13:16.970
there'’s anything there
that I haven'’t already seen.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.886
It'’s not seeing it I'm worried
about, it'’s polishing it.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.322
[giggling]

13:23.237 --> 13:25.413
Not funny.Not funny.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.415
Listen, if you have to get back

13:27.458 --> 13:29.243
to your daughter,
everything'’s under control here.

13:29.286 --> 13:32.289
One of my friends is watching
her, I can hang for a while.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.423
Hey, I got an idea.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.991
Why don'’t you two give
each other a sponge bob...

13:40.863 --> 13:42.560
...and I'’ll watch.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.092
Mm-mm.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.877
This is one terrific sandwich.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.836
This is the kind of sandwich
that would make

13:56.879 --> 14:00.883
any adult or child
feel very, very loved.

14:00.927 --> 14:04.017
Give me a break,
it'’s grilled cheese.

14:04.060 --> 14:08.325
Oh, okay, that answers
one of my questions.

14:10.675 --> 14:13.374
Come on, Jill, I didn'’t
mean to upset you.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.550
I was just mad
'’cause my mom left.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.769
And now I realize
I'’m better off.

14:17.813 --> 14:20.033
Really?

14:20.076 --> 14:22.122
Yeah. You think she would'’ve

14:22.165 --> 14:23.688
made me a grilled
cheese sandwich

14:23.732 --> 14:27.214
then let me watch her
play Candy Crush?

14:29.085 --> 14:31.261
Thank you, Christy Jo.

14:31.305 --> 14:34.090
I guess I'’m a little
extra vulnerable right now.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.571
This foster process
is kind of grueling.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.181
So many hoops to jump through.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.096
It'’s, like, give me
the damn kid, you dimwits.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.489
[scoffs]

14:41.532 --> 14:43.752
I get it.

14:43.795 --> 14:46.929
I mean, here I am,
recovering from a head injury,

14:46.973 --> 14:49.149
and you'’re the one
having a tough time.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.324
Right?

14:51.760 --> 14:54.023
[sighs]
You comfy? Do you need anything?

14:54.067 --> 14:56.156
I am a little cold.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.548
Really? I'’m warm.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.637
I'’ll open the window.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.948
[snoring]

15:18.004 --> 15:21.921
If you'’re looking for your
drink, I moved it over there.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.880
How thoughtful.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.056
Oh, I see we lost Adam.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.190
Yeah, opiates and alcohol
will do that to a person.

15:30.233 --> 15:33.106
Not me or Keith Richards,
but we'’re gifted that way.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.806
[snoring]

15:37.849 --> 15:40.026
You can run along now,
I'’ll put him to bed.

15:40.069 --> 15:43.290
No, I promised him I'’d stay and
I would never break a promise.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.335
Uh-huh.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.816
Unless it was a marriage vow.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.734
So that'’s how
you'’re gonna play it?

15:52.777 --> 15:54.344
I'’ll play it any way you want.

15:55.693 --> 15:56.956
Fine.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.655
[snores]

16:00.698 --> 16:02.613
[farts]

16:08.184 --> 16:12.754
You realize
that whoever wins this gets him.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.410
[farts]

16:19.891 --> 16:21.806
CHRISTY:
Jill, I appreciate your help,

16:21.850 --> 16:25.071
but I can go
to the bathroom by myself.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.116
Don'’t forget to wash your hands.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.553
I got it!

16:30.902 --> 16:33.340
Christy, I'’m worried.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.732
About what?

16:34.776 --> 16:37.300
I'’m not sure I'm cut out
to be a mother.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.823
Why would you say that?

16:38.867 --> 16:40.825
It'’s just that
I'’ve been here all day

16:40.869 --> 16:45.047
taking care of you, and frankly,
it'’s kind of tedious.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.049
[toilet flushing]

16:47.093 --> 16:49.834
And a little icky.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.315
Trust me,
you'’re overthinking it.

16:52.359 --> 16:53.403
Hands.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.405
Okay.

16:55.449 --> 16:56.885
[sighs]

16:56.928 --> 17:00.062
People make parenting
seem so fulfilling.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.064
What people are
you talking about?

17:02.108 --> 17:06.242
Facebook people,

17:06.286 --> 17:08.810
Instagram people,

17:08.853 --> 17:11.551
Kelly Ripa.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.207
Well, no one'’s gonna post
a video of their kid

17:14.250 --> 17:16.383
finger-painting with dog poop.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.819
Does that happen?

17:18.863 --> 17:21.518
It'’s most of what happens.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.868
Then why do people do it?

17:24.913 --> 17:27.220
This might be
the concussion talking,

17:27.262 --> 17:29.396
but... '’cause it's worth it.

17:29.439 --> 17:33.095
It'’s 60% hard work, 40% joy--

17:33.139 --> 17:36.098
your numbers may vary-- but...

17:36.142 --> 17:38.535
it makes you feel like
your life'’s worth something.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.581
So you really think
I can do this?

17:40.624 --> 17:43.105
I know you can do it.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.107
Thank you.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.848
You'’re welcome.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.806
Now get some rest.

17:51.331 --> 17:52.506
Christy?

17:52.549 --> 17:53.550
Yeah?

17:53.594 --> 17:54.682
Leave the light on.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.250
How about I leave
the hall light on

17:57.293 --> 17:58.903
and keep the door open a crack?

17:58.947 --> 18:00.035
Deal.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.996
[exhales]

18:05.040 --> 18:06.476
She'’s right.

18:06.520 --> 18:10.524
I'’m gonna make a great mom.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.092
You comfy?

18:13.135 --> 18:14.136
Mm-hmm.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.616
You have enough pillows?

18:15.659 --> 18:16.573
Yep.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.618
You love me?

18:17.661 --> 18:19.054
I do.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.882
Then why am I not
your emergency contact?!

18:20.925 --> 18:23.450
[bangs]

18:23.493 --> 18:25.408
Ow.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.634
[sighs] Okay, Danielle,
here'’s the deal.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.115
I'’m going to hire someone
to take care of Adam.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.074
Ideally, a large Filipino man.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.902
Are you really
so threatened that you'’d rather

18:40.945 --> 18:42.556
have a stranger tending to him?

18:42.599 --> 18:44.558
I'’m not threatened.
You'’re threatened.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.299
Why would I be threatened?

18:46.342 --> 18:48.692
Because I'’m threatening you.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.521
Oh, honey.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.741
You don'’t want to do that.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.351
Oh, yeah, yeah. Adam told me

18:55.395 --> 18:57.571
you were in the Army
a million years ago,

18:57.614 --> 18:59.747
so I'’m sure you're really great
at making a bed.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.359
But I have been beating snot
out of people

19:03.403 --> 19:05.753
since grade school
and I'’m really in the mood

19:05.796 --> 19:07.233
to beat the snot...

19:10.497 --> 19:12.063
[yells]

19:13.369 --> 19:15.589
What just happened?

19:15.632 --> 19:19.158
ADAM: You two girls
getting along out there?
