<i>- Previously on St. Elsewhere.
- It is legionnaires' disease.</i>

00:05.858 --> 00:08.928
- What would that mean?
- The hospital would be closed.

00:08.995 --> 00:12.298
I'm really not in the market
for a car, mark.
Not a car, a classic.

00:12.365 --> 00:15.034
Some guy named Barnum
wants to buy it.

00:15.101 --> 00:20.073
No, he doesn't.
You see, I'm Barnum.

00:20.139 --> 00:22.241
And now she's
three months' pregnant.

00:22.308 --> 00:24.744
<i>She's only been out of here
for two months.</i>

00:24.811 --> 00:26.746
They're building a nest.

00:26.813 --> 00:29.682
I can see that.
And she's gonna
have a baby in there.

But a "Coming out" Party because
she's having a hysterectomy?</i>

00:38.057 --> 00:39.992
That's just Leslie's way
of dealing with Things.

00:40.059 --> 00:43.596
Or do you wait
till he's in love with you
or you're in love with him?

00:43.663 --> 00:47.867
Then spring it on him,
"I've had this hysterectomy."

00:47.934 --> 00:51.671
Well, I refuse to raise
our child in an open-Top nest.

00:51.738 --> 00:54.507
Do you think Ralph
is able to function
in the world?

00:54.574 --> 00:56.342
- Yes, I do.
- Barnum?

00:56.409 --> 00:58.878
I, uh, made him up.

00:58.945 --> 01:02.782
Hey, how do you know
so much about birds, Ralph?
I am a bird.

02:34.841 --> 02:37.777
Anything else?
The angina pectoris in 438.

02:37.844 --> 02:39.779
Mm-Hmm.
He's talking gibberish.

02:39.846 --> 02:42.548
It's portuguese.
He's from angola.
Oh.

02:42.615 --> 02:45.918
I just thought he was nuts.
Get some sleep.

02:47.887 --> 02:50.089
Another message
from Barnum.

02:50.156 --> 02:52.792
Dr. Pat Barnum?

02:52.859 --> 02:56.529
Says if he doesn't hear
from me soon, he'll assume
I sold the car to somebody else.

02:56.596 --> 02:58.664
Hmm.

02:58.731 --> 03:01.000
Ever hear of a Barnum?
Sorry?

03:01.067 --> 03:03.603
Why do I talk
to this guy?

03:05.071 --> 03:07.907
I don't get it.
I've been sending
bogus messages...

03:07.974 --> 03:11.778
from Barnum to Craig
all week long, but I didn't
send any message this morning.

03:11.844 --> 03:14.414
[ chuckling ]
what--

03:14.480 --> 03:16.883
you?
I don't believe it.

03:16.949 --> 03:20.319
What are you doing, huh?
Surprise.

03:21.854 --> 03:24.857
It's a little twisted
if you ask me.
Nobody asked you.

03:24.924 --> 03:26.993
Well, I've never been accused
of BEING too conservative,

03:27.060 --> 03:29.228
but a "Coming out" Party
because she's having
a hysterectomy?

03:29.295 --> 03:31.431
That's just Leslie's way
of dealing with things.

03:31.497 --> 03:33.566
It's still twisted.
Besides, I wasn't invited.

03:33.633 --> 03:37.070
Luther, don't push yourself
too hard. We only have
40 extra patients, you know.

03:37.136 --> 03:39.072
I didn't get to sleep
till 5:00 a.M.

03:39.138 --> 03:42.308
5:00?
It's the nightlife
That's gonna kill you.

03:42.375 --> 03:46.045
What's in that box?
Oh, uh, wine.

03:46.112 --> 03:48.714
What are those holes?
You letting it breathe?

03:48.781 --> 03:51.284
Oh, Luther, come on.
Go get some rest.

03:51.350 --> 03:53.486
<i>[ Cooing ]</i>

03:53.553 --> 03:55.755
uh, I gotta see somebody.

03:57.457 --> 04:00.393
Well, we need another orderly
a la carte.

04:00.460 --> 04:03.096
I'll call the Maitre D'.

04:06.232 --> 04:09.569
good morning. What are you
doing lying in bed
on such a beautiful day?

04:09.635 --> 04:12.338
You should be out walking.
You finished?
Yeah.

04:12.405 --> 04:16.108
I'm being consumed
by my own appetite.

04:16.175 --> 04:19.712
All I do is eat,
and when I'm not eating
I think about Food.

04:19.779 --> 04:21.914
How much
have you gained?
Four pounds.

04:21.981 --> 04:25.785
Oh, that's nothing.
You know what I gained
when I was pregnant?

04:25.852 --> 04:29.222
Forty-Five.
You gained 45 pounds?

04:29.288 --> 04:31.224
Yep. Hold this.

04:31.290 --> 04:35.361
Yeah, that was
my first marriage.
I was mrs. Eisenberg then.

04:35.428 --> 04:37.864
You know,
I'd never even seen
potato latkes before.

04:37.930 --> 04:41.834
They were wonderful.
Cheese blintzes,
lots of sour cream.

04:41.901 --> 04:44.604
I got so fat I couldn't get
my wedding ring off.

04:44.670 --> 04:46.973
And my feet
swelled up two sizes.

04:47.039 --> 04:50.576
But the worst thing
about Getting so fat
is stretch marks.

04:50.643 --> 04:54.213
What can you do?
Well, eat sensibly.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.416
In your case,
probably eat enough.

04:56.482 --> 04:58.918
And exercise.
Every day?

04:58.985 --> 05:02.121
Mm-Hmm,
morning and night.

05:02.188 --> 05:05.691
Okay.
And enjoy being pregnant.

05:05.758 --> 05:09.362
I envy you.
Sure doesn't sound like it.

05:09.429 --> 05:11.731
I do.

05:15.968 --> 05:18.371
Right after you left
for cabo san Lucas,

05:18.438 --> 05:20.373
another patient came down
with similar symptoms,

05:20.440 --> 05:22.775
so I didn't wait
to hear from atlanta,
I closed down the ward.

05:22.842 --> 05:25.178
Cummings is quite Upset.

05:26.646 --> 05:29.449
He's a good man, you know.
I know.
Just doing his job.

05:29.515 --> 05:32.852
It's a very difficult
and in some ways
unrewarding job.

05:32.919 --> 05:35.254
I wasn't
being facetious.

05:38.591 --> 05:41.227
Have we found the source
of contamination?
No, not yet.

05:41.294 --> 05:44.864
We checked the
air-Conditioning and heating
units. They're all clear.

05:44.931 --> 05:48.067
Ventilation?
Nothing.

05:48.134 --> 05:52.371
Hmm. No stone unturned.
Let's hope not.

05:54.540 --> 05:57.810
Okay.
Off to the wards?

05:57.877 --> 06:01.514
Fighting the good fight.
Dr. Chandler?

06:01.581 --> 06:03.683
You're a doctor, right?
Right.

06:03.750 --> 06:07.086
Okay.
Let me ask you a question.
You know how sometimes...

06:07.153 --> 06:10.890
something can go wrong with you
in your body, but it's not
really comin' from your body,

06:10.957 --> 06:13.393
but coming
from your mind?
Psychosomatic.

06:13.459 --> 06:15.828
Right.
Psychosomatic.
Mm-hmm.

06:15.895 --> 06:18.431
If a person can have
this problem, can, like,

06:18.498 --> 06:22.535
other things have
psychosomatic problems?
Things? What other things?

06:22.602 --> 06:27.173
Well, like, plants and animals
and other things like that.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.877
You mean, would plants
and animals have
psychological problems?

06:30.943 --> 06:33.279
Yeah.
You mean like do dogs
get depressed?

06:33.346 --> 06:36.182
Yeah.
That's very interesting,
Luther.

06:36.249 --> 06:38.751
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, there's been
a lot of discussion about it.

06:38.818 --> 06:41.487
You see, it seems logical that
where there's brain activity...

06:41.554 --> 06:44.123
you would suffer from some sort
of psychological problems.

06:45.425 --> 06:47.994
Doc, plants
don't have brains.

06:48.061 --> 06:51.064
That's right.
But dogs do.

06:51.130 --> 06:53.800
And horses do
and cows do.

06:53.866 --> 06:55.802
And Pigeons.

06:55.868 --> 06:58.805
Look, Luther, are you going
to stand here and ask me
about every animal in the zoo?

06:58.871 --> 07:01.040
I got a lot of patients
to see.
I understand, doc.

07:01.107 --> 07:03.276
Just carry on.
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

07:03.342 --> 07:06.546
And I know patients
are more important than Pigeons.
Thank you, doc.

07:06.612 --> 07:10.483
Patrick and I went sailing
up the coast to bar Harbor
last weekend.

07:10.550 --> 07:12.885
Hey.
How'd you manage that?

07:12.952 --> 07:17.056
I got Carol to cover for me.
I don't believe this.

07:17.123 --> 07:22.795
Annie cavanero actually
chooses Personal pleasure over
professional responsibility?

07:22.862 --> 07:24.997
This Mcfarland guy
must be something else.

07:25.064 --> 07:26.532
You know what he did?
What?

07:26.599 --> 07:29.669
There's a nine-year-Old girl,
Tammy Plummer, up in traction,

07:29.736 --> 07:32.338
heartbroken
because she can't play
on the school soccer team.

07:32.405 --> 07:34.507
I told Patrick about her
the other night.

07:34.574 --> 07:39.312
The next day he shows up in her
room, spends two hours telling
her about lobster fishing.

07:39.378 --> 07:42.882
Now she's got a crush on him.
Sounds like she's
not the only one.

07:42.949 --> 07:45.251
I envy you, cavanero.
You?

07:45.318 --> 07:47.520
The man with a girl
in every on-Call room?

07:47.587 --> 07:50.022
I haven't felt like that
since I was married.

07:50.089 --> 07:53.893
What a year that was:
Graduated from dartmouth,
accepted at ucla,

07:53.960 --> 07:58.531
in love with
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

07:58.598 --> 08:02.635
And chateaugay won
the kentucky Derby,
paid off 10-To-1.

08:02.702 --> 08:06.873
That's what I like
about you, Ben. Deep down
you're just a sentimental guy.

08:16.082 --> 08:18.017
Very Festive.
Good.

08:18.084 --> 08:19.485
How you feeling?

08:19.552 --> 08:23.056
I'm ready for the hysterectomy
if that's what you mean.

08:23.122 --> 08:26.092
Everything set?
First thing in the morning.

08:26.159 --> 08:28.094
You promise I'm only gonna
be in here a week?

Oh, wonderful.

You never saw me Dance.
That's all right.
I can tell.

I have a very artistic eye,
in case you haven't noticed.

08:45.278 --> 08:48.047
Not to mention the fact
that I was a semifinalist...

08:48.114 --> 08:51.417
in the larchmont junior high
twist contest in 1964.

08:51.484 --> 08:53.619
Coming to my party?

I tried going up, but he keeps
throwing things at me.

Tweezers, thermometers.
He hit me in the head
with a bedpan.

I got orders to get rid
of that thing.

to relocate it?

10:00.286 --> 10:02.221
Okay.

10:02.288 --> 10:05.525
Ralph, would you consider
relocating the nest?

10:38.891 --> 10:41.627
All I know is what
my supervisor told me.

10:41.694 --> 10:45.698
Why couldn't we take
a little ecological license
and leave it.

10:45.765 --> 10:49.736
I can't do that, Dr. Beale.
Just until things
are straightened out.

for Leslie to avoid
the hysterectomy?

No. She's got
stage two cervical Carcinoma.

The master
of the soft touch.

He adopts the authoritative,
fatherly tone.
Drives me nuts.

11:38.718 --> 11:41.454
He's always so quick
to take everything out.

11:41.521 --> 11:44.357
"Why does she need a uterus?
She's got enough kids."

11:44.424 --> 11:47.927
"No more periods.
She'll thank me."

11:47.994 --> 11:50.363
My mother had
her ovaries removed.

11:50.430 --> 11:54.400
The doctor told her to,
so she did it without
asking any questions.

11:54.467 --> 11:57.103
She got old Real Quickly
after that.

11:57.170 --> 12:01.340
The lack of estrogen caused her
to go into early Menopause.

Male g.Y.N.'s don't always
emphasize the difference
in a pap smear...

12:04.444 --> 12:07.213
between
inflammatory reaction
and neoplasia.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.816
And they can't understand
why a woman won't come
to them electively...

he's going to treat her
during the examination.

I really like Leslie.

we have this real rapport.

I just hate to see her
go through all this.

12:25.631 --> 12:27.900
I'll tell you something,
Annie.

You know,
if things were reversed,

12:29.969 --> 12:32.705

facing castration,

12:32.772 --> 12:35.007
we'd see a hell of
a lot fewer operations.

12:36.375 --> 12:40.847
Victor, how are you?
Why the books?
Craig's lecture.

12:40.913 --> 12:44.484
It's on pediatric cardiac
surgery, and I know he's going
to try to put me on the spot.

12:44.550 --> 12:46.486

Anyway, I'm convinced
that every open-Top nest...

13:42.041 --> 13:44.477
is built according
to the same algebraic formula...

13:44.544 --> 13:47.513
than an engineer uses
to calculate stress.

13:47.580 --> 13:51.250
You worked out the formula?
Right. Exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

And you know why there's
been so much speculation
and argument back and forth?

13:54.287 --> 13:56.222
I mean, this has been
a hot issue for 25 years.

13:56.289 --> 14:00.875
Why?
Because nobody has actually
bothered to build a nest before.

14:00.875 --> 14:04.946
They took them apart,
and they built structures
like nests before.

14:05.013 --> 14:06.948
But I built one.

14:07.015 --> 14:09.667
It uses materials
readily available
from the environment,

25:15.866 --> 25:18.102
How'd you get Ralph
to move this?

25:18.168 --> 25:20.104
I promised him he could
have it in his room.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.673
Well, let's see.
He stole 2,100
tongue depressors,

25:22.740 --> 25:25.776
5,400 cotton balls,
seven dozen gauze bandages.

25:25.843 --> 25:27.778
How long did it take him
to build this thing?

25:27.845 --> 25:30.147
Fifty-Three hours.
It was an experiment.

25:30.214 --> 25:33.284
It was a felony.
He finally figured out
how birds do it.

25:33.350 --> 25:36.720
Apparently.
Make nests, I mean.

25:36.787 --> 25:40.124
So two psychiatric patients
got together to lay eggs.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.126
Not exactly
the way mother planned.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.628
No. But I don't know.
I've seen a lot of kids...

25:44.695 --> 25:47.731
with everything in the world
going for them, and some of them
are pretty screwed up.

25:47.798 --> 25:51.602
You really can't tell who's
going to be the best parent
or the best kid, can you?

25:51.669 --> 25:55.639

Um, the lounge okay?

26:17.528 --> 26:18.963
Sure.
Good.

about learning russian?

26:32.576 --> 26:36.080
I wanna talk to you
about Barnum.
Who?

26:36.146 --> 26:39.283
Dr. Pat Barnum.

26:39.350 --> 26:44.421
Oh, yeah, right.
He's a good man, I'm told.

26:44.488 --> 26:49.260
You're Barnum.
And don't try to deny it.

26:49.326 --> 26:52.096
There's a sucker
born every minute,
but I'm not one of them.

26:52.162 --> 26:56.367
Mark wouldn't be one either
if he had any kind of memory.

26:56.433 --> 26:59.470

you had the NURSES
set up an ABDOMINAL tray...

26:59.536 --> 27:02.673
instead of a cardiac tray
for a triple bypass.

27:04.141 --> 27:06.310
Okay, let me tell you
what's been going on...

27:06.377 --> 27:09.446
since Dr. Barnum
entered our lives.

27:09.513 --> 27:11.448
Mark spent all day
saturday and Sunday...

27:11.515 --> 27:13.784
washing, polishing,
vacuuming that car,

27:13.851 --> 27:16.220
just in hopes
that Dr. Barnum
would materialize.

27:16.287 --> 27:21.659
Last night he spent three hours
trying to get the Ping
out of the cylinders.

27:22.793 --> 27:26.030
I'm sorry.
Yesterday
He cut his hand.

27:27.164 --> 27:31.101
You know how that
can scare a surgeon?

27:31.168 --> 27:33.504
He's obsessed, Ben,

27:33.571 --> 27:36.240
and I'm here to tell you
it's gone far enough.

27:40.377 --> 27:43.314
[ sighs ]
I'm sorry.

27:43.380 --> 27:46.417

I'll tell him.

27:46.483 --> 27:48.986

My Stomach's been in knots.
I was afraid I'd have

27:52.156 --> 27:56.093
Probably because
you smoke too much.
You want some coffee?

27:57.795 --> 28:02.199

She's always been
so full of life.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.946
I remember when she
first learned to talk,

28:16.013 --> 28:20.050
she'd go around the HOUSE
saying everything she was doing
out loud, you know.

28:20.117 --> 28:22.720
Like, "now Leslie's
going up the stairs,

28:22.786 --> 28:25.122
and this is
the first stair."

28:25.189 --> 28:28.525
"Now Leslie's
taking her bath
in the big bathtub."

28:28.592 --> 28:32.329
[ chuckles ]
she shared everything.

28:32.396 --> 28:34.331
One time she said--
She was only two--

28:34.398 --> 28:39.069
she said, "I'm happy
in the big world."

28:39.136 --> 28:42.006
[ chuckles ]
it was good for me,
you know.

28:42.072 --> 28:47.978
Because I've never had such
a positive outlook myself.

28:49.647 --> 28:51.815
She can always adopt,
Mrs. Stevenson.

28:53.150 --> 28:56.620
She won't though.
I know the way she is.

for her.

can bring so much joy
into your life.

29:20.311 --> 29:24.081
Nothing.

29:24.148 --> 29:26.750
Now she'll
never know that.

29:26.817 --> 29:29.119
That's why she can act
like this.

<i>[ Ralph ]
I spent an entire night
in the cemetery once.</i>

38:05.803 --> 38:08.505
<i>Didn't sleep a wink.
[ Jane ]
Ralph, why?</i>

38:08.572 --> 38:10.507
<i>Ken bonafong dared me.</i>

38:10.574 --> 38:14.211
<i>There was no way I was gonna
let that enfant terrible
make fun of me.</i>

38:14.278 --> 38:17.481
[ chuckles ]
we were 11 years old.

38:17.548 --> 38:19.683
<i>Scusi.</i>

38:19.750 --> 38:21.785
Can we have three glasses
of water with our meal?

38:21.852 --> 38:27.124
We had this house in gulfport
that we all thought was haunted.

38:27.191 --> 38:31.528
The Butler place.
Had a BLACK housemaid
named Floradell.

38:31.595 --> 38:33.931
We were too scared
to even go up there.

38:33.998 --> 38:39.069
Floradell Kept house
for Mr. Butler, I'd say
about 35 years.

38:39.136 --> 38:42.539
After he died,
she stayed on
in the house for a while.

38:42.606 --> 38:46.977
Everybody said old floradell
could talk to the dead.

38:47.044 --> 38:50.447
I bet there was a lot
of gossip about what
Mr. Butler and floradell...

38:50.514 --> 38:52.716
did in that house
for 35 years.

38:52.783 --> 38:56.820
Yeah, but nobody got
too worked up about it though.
Why's that?

38:56.887 --> 38:59.623
Well, Mr. Butler
was president of the bank.

38:59.690 --> 39:03.694
Nobody much cared
what he did as long as
he'd lend them some money.

39:03.761 --> 39:05.696
Anyway, he finally died.

39:05.763 --> 39:07.798
The house stayed empty
for about five years.

39:07.865 --> 39:10.601
He had some THIRD cousins
over in Jackson...

39:10.668 --> 39:15.005
that were trying
to figure out who got what.

39:15.072 --> 39:19.577
Floradell stayed for a while,
but then she just up
and Disappeared.

39:19.643 --> 39:22.313
<i>[ Jane ]
was she ever seen again?</i>

39:22.379 --> 39:25.182
<i>Well, somebody said they
saw her down in New orleans,
selling flowers,</i>

39:25.249 --> 39:30.988
<i>but most people think
that the devil came and got her.
[ mews ]</i>

39:31.055 --> 39:35.659
<i>they sold the house to
a hellfire and brimstone
preacher, Joe Willy Babcock.</i>

39:35.726 --> 39:40.631
<i>Now Joe Willy
had two HUGE flatbed Trucks.</i>

39:40.698 --> 39:43.634
- [ mews ]
- He put the house on the truck.

39:43.701 --> 39:47.104
[ screaming ]

39:50.107 --> 39:51.942
Ralph! Ralph!

39:52.009 --> 39:56.680
Mr. Demaio in 218's got a sign
taped up next to his BED:

39:56.747 --> 40:00.217
"I will give a blood sample
one time a day,
and one time only."

40:00.284 --> 40:02.419
leukemia?

40:02.486 --> 40:05.256
Says he's starting to feel
like a pincushion.

40:05.322 --> 40:08.726
His veins are all down.
It's really pretty depressing.

40:08.792 --> 40:12.396
I'll talk to him tomorrow.
Not tonight, tomorrow.

40:14.031 --> 40:16.767
They pushed Leslie Stevenson
back an hour tomorrow morning
to 7:00.

40:16.834 --> 40:20.437
Do you want me to still
hold on her medication
or should I give it to her now?

40:20.504 --> 40:23.107
Let's give it to her now.
She needs the sleep.

40:23.173 --> 40:25.075
I'll do it.

40:27.244 --> 40:30.080
Who's doing the operation?
Dr. Samuels.

40:35.686 --> 40:38.255
Sleep time.
Oh, thank god.

40:38.322 --> 40:41.225
This is probably
the lousiest ceiling
I've ever had to look up at.

40:41.292 --> 40:43.227
These will knock you out
pretty well.

40:43.294 --> 40:46.497
They've moved the operation
up to 7:00.

40:46.564 --> 40:50.367
Sooner the better.
Here's to damaged Goods.

40:51.569 --> 40:55.105
Don't think of yourself
that way.

40:55.172 --> 40:59.510
I won't if they won't.
Men, I mean.

40:59.577 --> 41:03.047
But they will.
The right one won't.

41:03.113 --> 41:05.549
There's some terrific guys
out there.

41:05.616 --> 41:08.018
[ sighs ]

41:08.085 --> 41:10.221
you know I was
just lying here,

41:10.287 --> 41:13.557
thinking about when it is
exactly that you...

41:13.624 --> 41:17.194
tell this kind of story
to someone.

41:17.261 --> 41:22.066
I mean, what,
on your first date
over dinner?

41:22.132 --> 41:24.868
"Look, Charlie,
if you're looking
for the breeding type,

41:24.935 --> 41:26.870
you're wasting
your money."

41:26.937 --> 41:32.476
Do you wait until he's in love
with you, or you're in love
with him,

41:32.543 --> 41:35.646
and then spring it
on him?

41:35.713 --> 41:39.116
"Gee, see, I've had
this hysterectomy."

41:45.122 --> 41:49.126
[ sniffles ]
I'm all right.

41:49.193 --> 41:51.095
Really.

42:01.705 --> 42:03.641
Have you ever
been pregnant, Annie?

42:03.707 --> 42:07.745
No, but I've been thinking
about it a lot lately.

42:07.811 --> 42:12.917
I have.
It was about
five years ago.

42:12.983 --> 42:15.286
Just been in Boston
about six months.

42:15.352 --> 42:19.189
Had my first Real job
as a dancer.

42:19.256 --> 42:23.294
A guy, his name was curt,
wanted to marry me,
but I said no.

42:24.328 --> 42:26.864
Not because I didn't
love him.

42:26.931 --> 42:28.832
Well, I didn't want to
be a mother then.

42:30.067 --> 42:32.002
I wanted to be a dancer.

42:34.905 --> 42:37.007
So I had an abortion.

42:37.074 --> 42:39.109
And people kept saying,
"Oh, it must have been hard."

42:39.176 --> 42:41.679
But it wasn't.

42:41.745 --> 42:44.248
It wasn't anything.

42:45.950 --> 42:48.586
I've barely thought
about it since.

42:55.526 --> 42:59.530
[ sniffles ]
I'm tired.
I think I'll sleep now.

42:59.597 --> 43:02.032
Have a good sleep.

43:22.720 --> 43:26.156
Well, if it isn't
the young Dr. Cavanero.

43:26.223 --> 43:28.192
I thought you would have
gone out with the tide.

43:28.259 --> 43:30.861
That's nasty looking.
What happened to you?

43:30.928 --> 43:33.731
Nothing.
Craig can't take a joke,

43:33.797 --> 43:37.434
and, uh, I can't take a punch.

43:37.501 --> 43:40.237
Listen, that hysterectomy
tomorrow morning--
Leslie Stevenson.

43:40.304 --> 43:42.239
Yeah?
She's a friend.

43:42.306 --> 43:44.241
What, a college Buddy?

43:44.308 --> 43:46.777
No, just a friend.

43:46.844 --> 43:50.014
She could use a little
bedside manner tomorrow.
Okay?

43:50.080 --> 43:52.016
Absolutely.

43:57.154 --> 43:59.423
How is it with you?
Fine.

43:59.490 --> 44:01.425
Yeah?

44:01.492 --> 44:03.427
You said this morning
that you envied me--

44:03.494 --> 44:06.430
my relationship
with Patrick.

44:06.497 --> 44:09.567
Well, it isn't
gonna work out.

44:09.633 --> 44:13.137
He's such a nice guy,
but already
I can see the signs.

44:13.203 --> 44:16.807
Why is it that
it doesn't work out?
Why is that?

44:16.874 --> 44:19.743
[ sighs ]
I don't know.

44:19.810 --> 44:21.745
Maybe because
you don't want it to.

44:21.812 --> 44:24.114
At least not right now.

44:24.181 --> 44:26.884
I see Leslie
lying in that room,

44:26.951 --> 44:29.253
and I feel like I'm looking
into an open grave.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.388
Annie.

44:33.057 --> 44:36.160
You're a young woman.
You got a lot of time
to have a family.

44:36.227 --> 44:39.296
I'm not a cold person.

44:39.363 --> 44:42.833
But sometimes it can get
so hard around here.

44:42.900 --> 44:47.471
So hard that I feel myself
closing off desires,

44:47.538 --> 44:50.007
wants, dreams.

44:50.074 --> 44:54.311
<i>When is it that what you have
isn't worth what you're missing?</i>

44:54.378 --> 44:56.814
Leslie Stevenson
wanted a career,

44:56.880 --> 45:00.451
so she put everything else
on hold until it was too late.

45:02.353 --> 45:05.122
She didn't plan
for it to be that way.
It just happened.

45:05.189 --> 45:09.426
She didn't plan
for the passage of time.
It just passed.

45:11.228 --> 45:14.031
I don't want that
to happen to me.

45:14.098 --> 45:16.033
I don't want to wake up
at 40 alone,

45:16.100 --> 45:18.836
without love,
without children.

45:18.903 --> 45:23.507
<i>I don't want that
to happen to me.
Then don't you let it.</i>

45:30.915 --> 45:33.984
You okay?

45:34.051 --> 45:36.120
I'm gonna take good care
of your friend tomorrow.

45:38.088 --> 45:39.990
Get some sleep.

45:42.192 --> 45:46.130
That's the last time
I go out with
a public utilities Employee.

45:46.196 --> 45:48.132
Why, what happened?
Nothing.

45:48.198 --> 45:51.702
We can't win. The N.L.R.B.
Says we can't unionize
because We're students,

45:51.769 --> 45:54.238
then the I.R.S. Says
we have to pay taxes
because We're doctors.

45:54.305 --> 45:57.708
So I'm borrowing money
at the rate of 21%.

46:18.796 --> 46:20.698
Hello, Ralph.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.870
Sweetheart, I'm not angry.
Please don't be angry
at yourself.

46:27.972 --> 46:30.040
I know you tried.

46:34.745 --> 46:38.048
I talked to my father today.

46:38.115 --> 46:41.452
First time in a long time.

46:41.518 --> 46:44.889
He says he wants to help.

46:44.955 --> 46:47.291
I believe him.

46:47.358 --> 46:50.494
He sounded different.

46:50.561 --> 46:52.930
Or maybe it was me.

46:54.932 --> 46:56.967
Ralph, do you hear me?

47:07.478 --> 47:10.347
I remember
when we first met.

47:10.414 --> 47:13.951
I was in my room, crying so hard
that they had to put me
in restraints.

47:14.018 --> 47:18.122
You came in and started talking
to me about flying.

47:19.990 --> 47:23.327
About the swallows
in mexico...

47:23.394 --> 47:25.863
and how you migrated
1,500 miles with them...

47:25.930 --> 47:28.098
to the steeple
in San Juan Capistrano.

47:28.165 --> 47:31.502
How you soared
the blue Ridge mountains...

47:31.569 --> 47:34.738
in An indian summer sun,

47:34.805 --> 47:39.076
and landed finally
on the highest branch of
a thousand-year-Old Pine tree,

47:39.143 --> 47:44.682
and looked down on
a field of absolute stillness.

47:44.748 --> 47:47.618
Are you there now, Ralph?

47:47.685 --> 47:49.620
Is the wind filling your ears?

47:50.888 --> 47:53.891
The thing I'm trying
to tell you is that...

47:53.958 --> 47:56.493
the greatest day of my life
was the day I met you.

47:58.362 --> 48:01.098
And no matter What anybody
says about either of us,

48:01.165 --> 48:05.603
our child will know that...

48:05.669 --> 48:07.571
in his heart.

48:11.141 --> 48:13.644
Good-Bye,
my high-Flying bird.

48:15.012 --> 48:16.947
My eagle.

49:01.292 --> 49:02.793
[ mews ]
