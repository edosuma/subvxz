A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:18.435 --> 00:19.936
[Antonio] Teo has no evidence.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.605
What happened shows he's desperate.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.859
Let's carry on
as if none of this was happening.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.030
-What are we going to do?
-Nothing.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.450
Go out with friends,
dine out, show ourselves.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.955
We can't give the impression we're hiding.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.251
This shirt looks good on you.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.587
[Antonio] You should wear it more often.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.506
You never wear it.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.635
You look nice.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.056
I'm scared.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.601
-We have to buy some time.
-What for?

00:59.684 --> 01:01.144
Teo has many enemies.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.354
I'll take care of it.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.940
What will you do?

01:21.498 --> 01:22.707
Are you tired?

01:24.542 --> 01:25.835
And angry?

01:29.214 --> 01:31.257
Elena isn't my only concern.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.140
Inés...

01:39.891 --> 01:40.850
my mom...

01:42.393 --> 01:43.853
What about her?

01:46.397 --> 01:47.607
She didn't kill herself.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.660
Lorenzo killed her.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.831
What are you saying?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.544
I have evidence, witnesses.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.422
The case was barred and Lorenzo
made sure he went unpunished.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.931
I want to help you.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.395
And help my daughter to live in peace.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.484
But you have to promise
you won't use our history to harm me.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.952
I want Lorenzo to pay for what he did.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.206
Can you do something?

02:46.291 --> 02:49.252
From my new position,
I can do almost anything.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.551
Reopen the case.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.638
[footsteps approach]

03:02.015 --> 03:03.766
You can see your daughter.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.602
[doctor] She's out of danger.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.693
[cellphone rings]

03:14.360 --> 03:16.195
-Hello.
- [Teo]  I made a mistake with Aníbal.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.907
Ronnie, Antonio's husband,
is to blame for the fire.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.492
-How do you know?
-I interrogated him.

03:21.576 --> 03:25.538
-I see, now you're a cop too.
-Ronnie was in the factory that night.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.207
He hates Lorenzo and Edha. They fired him.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.627
He took them to court
and won compensation.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.503
Lorenzo got the money back.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.464
Do you have evidence of that?

03:34.547 --> 03:36.633
You have two innocent people in there.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.260
They'll pay for something they didn't do.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.554
What I'll use is what I have.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.640
I want Lorenzo in prison.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.060
This is not the time to get creative
and heed mere assumptions.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.020
Why is my brother still in jail?

03:49.103 --> 03:51.856
Your brother is detained
for his own safety.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.943
And Aníbal's new defense
asked for an extraordinary measure.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.819
What the fuck is going on?

03:56.903 --> 04:00.531
Aníbal will be set free,
I have no evidence to prevent it.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.661
I'm doing what I can.
Lorenzo has very good lawyers.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.921
My baby.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.801
It's alright. It's over, it's over.
I'm taking you home.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.052
Don't touch me!

04:22.345 --> 04:24.138
I got you out.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.599
There are places I'll never get out of.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.977
OK. Let's talk later, when we're calmer.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.312
Don't come near me or my mom again.

04:31.729 --> 04:35.692
-Hear? Never again!
-What, are you threatening me?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.951
He doesn't seem very happy with you.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.622
Children are like that.
He'll thank me soon enough.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.166
You got away.

04:53.334 --> 04:56.045
No... you saved me.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.800
Now it turns out it wasn't an accident,
and my son didn't do it either.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.971
I'll prove that the foreman
worked for you.

05:05.638 --> 05:09.767
Prove whatever you want. Everyone
knows the foreman ran the factory.

05:10.268 --> 05:13.354
And after the fire,
he disappeared and faked his death.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.649
And he falsely accused my son.
Who will they believe?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.443
[scoffs]

05:18.526 --> 05:21.529
-This doesn't end here.
-You know what? It does.

05:22.989 --> 05:27.035
We both know perfectly well this
doesn't have anything to do with the fire.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.662
Look...

05:30.246 --> 05:32.749
your old man was
a decent, honest fellow...

05:33.708 --> 05:36.169
but he died the same way you will.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.923
Guys like you don't have
any reason to live.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.259
So you look for it
in other people's tragedies.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.221
Step aside from the family tradition.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.099
Get a life and stop bothering me.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.269
You have a daughter, right?

05:53.770 --> 05:57.482
How long since you've seen her,
because you're busy ruining my family?

05:58.524 --> 06:00.902
Acknowledge your own miseries

06:00.985 --> 06:02.945
and leave us all in peace.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.791
I'm not denying what I did.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.377
But seeing what you did to Julián...

06:20.546 --> 06:23.633
it disturbed me, no matter
what happened between him and me.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.803
-Can you explain?
-It was a mistake.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.057
I acted rashly, because of our history.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.144
Your mom was your age
when she got pregnant.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.441
-I don't care about that now.
-It's important to me...

06:40.691 --> 06:41.818
and the three of us.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.778
Really.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.826
I've always felt guilty
and never knew how to handle it.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.538
What happened with Julián...

06:54.622 --> 06:57.291
brought that past back,
and I made a mistake.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.296
One can't fix the past but...

07:03.422 --> 07:07.426
I can ensure the future, and I wanted
to ensure he doesn't touch you ever again.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.182
I was a jerk...

07:14.725 --> 07:16.102
to both of you.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.694
That's why I apologize.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.406
Let's start over.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.121
[footsteps]

07:54.807 --> 07:56.142
So? What happened?

07:56.934 --> 07:58.603
Manito self-incriminated.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.482
Your brother is about to get crushed.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.234
They want someone to be guilty,
and he's perfect.

08:05.651 --> 08:09.280
-But he isn't a criminal.
-No, but Aníbal has better lawyers.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.617
-Lorenzo bailed him out.
-It was Ronnie!

08:13.534 --> 08:15.578
My brother will end up in prison.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.831
What's next, what do we do?

08:19.665 --> 08:22.502
We have to get money to bail Manito out.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.504
We need money, a lot of it.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.756
-How much?
-All of it.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.426
And we have no time left.
Seven days, tops.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.603
-Hello.
-Hello.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.564
[Antonio] A lot better,
you look good, gorgeous.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.692
-[Elena] Yes, I'm better.
-Much better than your mom.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.736
You should give her the bed.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.614
I can't remember when I slept last.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.324
-I'll buy you a coffee.
-Please.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.201
-Ronnie stays here.
-OK.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.453
I'll be fine.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.956
The only thing that matters is Elena.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.792
-Do you understand?
-Of course.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.126
I always did, didn't I?

09:06.337 --> 09:07.505
Yes.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.217
[cellphone rings]

09:14.303 --> 09:16.389
It's Teo. Answer it.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.015
[cellphone rings]

09:19.100 --> 09:20.434
What for? I'm with you.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.729
[cellphone rings]

09:33.823 --> 09:36.325
Each has to look after their own family.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.371
I own the responsibility for raising
my daughter, and I'm proud of it.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.872
If this woman, Edha...

09:41.956 --> 09:45.251
who's pretty insane,
has a problem with her daughter--

09:45.334 --> 09:46.502
What are you doing?

09:46.836 --> 09:49.213
-You're not getting in this car.
-Nor our house.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.465
Here, love. Let's go.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.558
[motor starts]

10:03.185 --> 10:05.479
[car accelerates away]

10:08.274 --> 10:10.192
I don't want you to leave everything.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.155
We can find a middle ground,
you don't need to leave Edha.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.200
-It makes me feel guilty.
-I'll find something that excites me.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.411
I have to be here with you.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.330
And don't feel guilty.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.498
On the contrary.

10:26.917 --> 10:27.877
[sighs]

10:27.960 --> 10:29.003
All done.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.798
Get some rest.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.804
Luciano.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.187
-Could you see about Lorenzo?
-I'm on it.

10:47.229 --> 10:50.483
I think it will be hard.
You'll have to be strong.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.318
You doubt my strength.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.780
No... none.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.074
[cellphone beeps]

11:00.076 --> 11:00.910
TEO: I'M HERE.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.662
-Can you stay with Elena?
-Of course.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.663
Good.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.914
[footsteps move away]

11:18.844 --> 11:20.012
[sighs]

11:23.432 --> 11:26.102
-What do you mean, Milan is out?
-I don't want to.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.687
-When were you going to tell me?
-We just decided.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.524
-"We"?
-Yes, we. With my daughter. Both of us.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.527
You can pursue your career alone.
You don't need me.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.654
And the money? We have a contract.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.573
I won't forget you.
This is not the time to talk.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.201
-My brother's still in jail.
-I know.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.454
-I need money to get him out!
-I'm not forgetting that.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.833
-[Jáuregui] Is there a problem?
-No, he was leaving.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.338
The boutique is closed.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.882
[Jáuregui grumbles]

11:56.966 --> 11:59.176
I don't know what your intentions are,

11:59.260 --> 12:02.179
but this is not the right time.
We have a family situation.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.390
My daughter isn't well, she's recovering.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.475
And you come here...

12:07.226 --> 12:08.894
so overbearing.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.772
-Will you pay me?
-Yes, how much?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.775
-A lot. What the contract says.
-What does the contract say?

12:14.859 --> 12:19.071
Did you read it? I mean, did you
consult with any legal professional?

12:19.488 --> 12:21.365
Do you know what you signed?

12:22.908 --> 12:25.703
Teo... you don't look like a bad kid.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.997
No one will rip you off.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.541
It'd be best if you waited
for news from Edha.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.587
Don't come back to this house
with such an attitude.

12:35.296 --> 12:39.049
Hmm? I can give you part
of what you're owed, no problem.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.012
This enough for the cab?

12:51.145 --> 12:51.979
[motorbike revs]

12:55.691 --> 12:57.276
[sighs]

13:29.141 --> 13:30.601
Why are you here?

13:32.478 --> 13:33.812
I was left with nothing.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.941
No Milan and no money for Manito's bail.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.859
What happened?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.779
Edha's out. She's not going to Milan.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.614
Everything went to shit.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.078
I told you she'd fuck you over.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.955
I didn't listen to you.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.293
I enjoy seeing you like this.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.421
Really?

14:01.674 --> 14:02.675
Yes.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.224
I trusted that bastard DA
and Manito ended up paying.

14:11.058 --> 14:14.061
If you hadn't taken him out,
they'd have killed him.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.987
You can still go to Milan.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.865
And get the money to get Manito out.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.536
-How?
-With me.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.208
I'm going to Milan with Yastin and Paloma.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.961
I'm going to walk the runway.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.381
It seems us poor people are in style.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.510
I didn't know you wanted that.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.221
I always did.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.516
-Why didn't you tell me?
-You wouldn't have understood.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.935
Now you do.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.938
No one likes to live in shit.

15:00.274 --> 15:04.153
When Paloma hears you're not with
Edha, she'll pay anything to have you.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.281
Do you want to go?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.783
Yes.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.457
Get out, I don't want Yastin
to see us together.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.836
If he finds out,
I'll sweep hair for the rest of my life.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.547
Go on.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.633
Bye.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.307
[footsteps move away]

15:37.937 --> 15:40.481
[Edha]  Nothing we went through
compares with this.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.274
Don't even try.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.527
[Lorenzo]  Darling... I apologize.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.988
Forgive me.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.199
I did what I could.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.285
And what I did was to protect you.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.330
From the truth, yes, but a truth...

15:59.917 --> 16:02.252
a truth too painful, I assure you.

16:05.172 --> 16:09.551
[Edha]  It's time. Stop protecting me,
I want the truth.

16:10.344 --> 16:15.641
[Lorenzo]  That night we were
a little drunk, it was an accident.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.227
[Edha]  How did she die?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.354
[Lorenzo]  You don't want to know that.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.899
[Edha]  It's the only way
for me to keep on living.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.193
[Lorenzo gasps]

16:26.276 --> 16:27.987
[Lorenzo]  She ran out of air.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.155
[Edha]  You choked her.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.657
No, it's for him...

16:32.157 --> 16:35.494
[Edha]  Tell me, I need you to tell me
so I can forgive you.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.455
[Lorenzo]  Yes, but it was part of a game.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.543
[Edha]  You killed her
and then staged a suicide.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.794
[Lorenzo sobs]

16:43.877 --> 16:49.842
[Lorenzo]  It wasn't just me.
Odette agreed. To everything.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.386
[Edha]  How could you carry on living?

16:53.762 --> 16:55.389
[lighter flickers]

16:55.472 --> 16:56.849
[Edha]  How do you do it?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.519
Go, go. Just go.

17:04.857 --> 17:09.069
[DA Ramos] I heard your recording.
The testimony is staggering.

17:09.737 --> 17:13.449
Good. With this,
we have sufficient evidence.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.036
Now, we wait for the order
to reopen the case.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.914
-Can Lorenzo go to prison?
-Well, it's a pretty concrete possibility.

17:28.964 --> 17:32.301
Now you can find out the truth
about the factory fire.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.511
I'm working on it, yes.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.473
You know it was sabotage.
You sure it was the foreman?

17:38.932 --> 17:41.894
I don't think he was the main perpetrator,
but he's implicated.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.229
A lot of people are implicated, even me.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.816
-But the perpetrator?
-I don't think so.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.236
If Teo's brother isn't responsible,
he shouldn't be here.

17:51.612 --> 17:55.032
If you want Lorenzo behind bars,
you'd better find another suspect.

17:55.115 --> 18:00.287
Well, there's no need for me to say
how excited I am about this trip,

18:00.370 --> 18:03.123
and what Milan means to all of us.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.793
We have a new addition, Teo.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.129
He'll be part of our team,
and the main model.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.715
So, treat him well. Or very well.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.259
You have no other choice anyway.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.555
[music plays over stereo]

18:21.016 --> 18:23.060
-You didn't tell me anything.
-No.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.313
We're not partners.
I don't have to tell you everything.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.524
You're right. Me neither.

18:29.024 --> 18:33.153
If you want, stay with the girls.
With him, I have everything I need.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.072
What's up with him?

18:40.077 --> 18:41.912
I want to talk to you.

18:43.539 --> 18:47.084
Your little friend, lover...
does he know about our side business?

18:47.167 --> 18:49.628
-No.
-Are you sure?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.591
[rings doorbell]

19:07.479 --> 19:08.939
[door closes]

19:11.024 --> 19:13.986
[phone rings]

19:15.362 --> 19:18.115
[breathes heavily]

19:18.198 --> 19:20.284
Antonio, I've been subpoenaed.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.953
You told me they didn't have evidence.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.664
Don't do anything until I'm there.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.082
-What do I do?
-Ronnie.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.459
-What if they ask about you?
-Ronnie.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.421
We're in this together. I'll handle it.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.342
[door closes]

19:42.890 --> 19:44.057
What happened?

19:44.141 --> 19:48.395
We're going to record our testimony.
We'll tell the truth, that we're guilty.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.856
Upload it to the web and make it viral.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.150
-Are you crazy?
-No, I'm not crazy.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.486
We'll explain what happened
and why it happened.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.115
We'll apologize,
because we never meant to hurt anyone.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.368
Neither you nor me
wanted this to become a tragedy.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.746
This video will buy us time.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.415
It will excite public opinion
and hit the press.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.293
If we explain, people will be on our side.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.963
I don't get why we have to do this,
we have to escape.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.715
We have to leave the country!

20:16.798 --> 20:18.759
-No one wants us to talk.
-Why?

20:19.259 --> 20:21.178
If we confess, the case is closed.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.639
We go to prison.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.641
Because if we expose Lorenzo...

20:26.350 --> 20:28.560
we'll expose his relation
with the sweatshop.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.479
That's fine.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.608
-He should go to prison.
-It won't happen that way.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.819
He'll kill us. In fact,
we're already being followed.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.447
-What?
-There's a car outside already.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.699
-I was followed here.
-What?

20:42.783 --> 20:45.327
The moment we set foot outside,
they'll kill us.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.496
Listen to me.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.039
My God.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.416
It'll be all right.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.210
[Ronnie gasps]

20:53.293 --> 20:54.920
I spoke with my dad's lawyers.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.882
If there was another way,
I would have told you.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.261
We have to accept that we'll go to prison.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.930
It's much better
being in prison than dead.

21:06.848 --> 21:10.227
Besides, we'll be together... forever.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.230
You're a strong person.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.398
[Ronnie sighs]

21:14.481 --> 21:15.857
You'll get through this.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.318
I know it. Trust me.

21:19.319 --> 21:22.030
Ronnie... Look at me.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.950
Look at me, Ronnie.

21:28.578 --> 21:29.830
Do you trust me?

21:39.965 --> 21:41.383
Give me your phone.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.141
[Ronnie]  I'm guilty.
I can't bear this any longer.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.811
But all of this
is Lorenzo Abadi's responsibility.

21:53.437 --> 21:57.357
He fired me without cause,
and then with criminal tactics

21:57.441 --> 21:59.943
forced me to return every cent
of the compensation.

22:00.027 --> 22:04.072
For years I was belittled,
a victim of beatings and threats.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.660
Edha and Lorenzo
are responsible for all of this.

22:09.369 --> 22:12.289
They tried to pull me away
from my love, but couldn't.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.667
They took advantage of his talent.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.253
Regretfully...

22:20.130 --> 22:24.593
moved by the hate they made me feel
all these years I went to that sweatshop.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.220
Yes. I was there.

22:29.222 --> 22:33.727
I'm responsible for the fire
that killed innocent workers,

22:33.810 --> 22:36.605
who worked, in slavery,
for the brand Edha.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.860
I never thought things
would end like this,

22:41.943 --> 22:45.155
but I take responsibility for my actions
and ask for forgiveness.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.993
To the victims...
to their families, to everyone.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.662
[camera shutter]

22:53.914 --> 22:54.998
I'm sorry.

22:56.374 --> 22:57.959
[camera shutter]

22:59.086 --> 23:00.629

[camera beeps]

23:24.069 --> 23:25.195
Thank you.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.531
I'll take it from here.

23:28.615 --> 23:29.658
[Mota] Take care.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.205
[motor revs]

24:19.416 --> 24:20.959
Why don't you come home?

24:22.586 --> 24:25.088
Let's lie on the couch, cry together...

24:25.172 --> 24:26.548
do whatever you want.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.676
I need to be alone for a while.

24:30.093 --> 24:32.846
-Calm down and think.
-OK, do whatever you need.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.348
But I'm here for you.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.519
Ronnie was a good person.

24:39.895 --> 24:43.148
I don't know what made him do it.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.068
Count on us.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.790
[cellphone rings, beeps]

25:01.499 --> 25:04.211
- [Lorenzo]  Where are you?
-With the dog. What is it?

25:04.294 --> 25:07.422
We're leaving in two hours.
I got tickets and hotel reservations.

25:07.505 --> 25:08.757
When? Where to?

25:08.840 --> 25:12.344
Ask anything you want, on the plane.
I want to be together.

25:12.427 --> 25:15.138
Sunbathe, fresh air, that's what I need.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.224
Why do we have to run off?

25:17.766 --> 25:20.977
Look, if you keep asking questions,
I'm leaving alone.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.771
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.693
[tires screech]

25:40.789 --> 25:42.207
You emptied the place.

25:42.707 --> 25:43.917
Yes.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.213
I need to start over. Lighter.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.175
Let go of many things, a long past.

25:52.926 --> 25:53.969
And me?

25:56.012 --> 25:59.349
It's not easy letting go of you.
I don't know if I want to.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.396
Your brother is free. Have you seen him?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.692
He doesn't want to see me.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.537
I'm going to Milan...

26:22.414 --> 26:23.790
with Paloma.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.419
That doesn't surprise me.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.546
You're the best, and I'm proud.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.965
-Proud?
-Yes.

26:32.549 --> 26:33.883
I found you.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.719
And I dared.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.514
-You didn't dare too much.
-As much as I could.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.226
-Does the small man live here?
-Who?

26:43.893 --> 26:45.520
The one who barked at me.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.564
No, he's my daughter's father.

26:47.647 --> 26:48.606
[scoffs]

26:50.191 --> 26:51.192
You're jealous.

26:55.488 --> 26:58.742
Some advice for you.
Never smile on the runway.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.161
I'm not on the runway.

27:04.831 --> 27:07.876
We never talked like this...honestly.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.254
It wasn't necessary.

Hello.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.722
You changed a lot.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.351
Thanks to Edha.

I'll see you shortly.

OK, alright. Bye.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.514

28:10.146 --> 28:13.400
We were waiting for you.
Please, follow me.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.778
She is coming.
This way, please.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.073
We are ready.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.032
Yes, go with Teo.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.660
I'll take the rest of the models
and clothes later.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.851
That night, I asked them
to clear the factory.

I thought there was no one inside.

[Antonio]  I don't understand
how this happened...

30:29.786 --> 30:33.206
or who gave them the order
to stay in the sweatshop.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.503
I told everyone to leave.
I saw them getting out.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.839
I even left the doors open.

After that, I opened the switchboard.

I ask for your forgiveness...

31:09.492 --> 31:12.537
to the victims' families.
I'm not a murderer.

intended to hurt anybody.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.959
Innocent people died...

34:06.753 --> 34:08.546
in the name of productivity.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.720
To lower costs and be able
to produce more and more.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.476
[sighs]

34:21.559 --> 34:23.227
I'm also responsible.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.110
But now we have to start over.

34:32.278 --> 34:35.490
In here, we'll do everything I wanted
and never dared to dream.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.244
How?

34:40.703 --> 34:43.456
With help...Antonio.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.042
He's no longer an employee,
but a partner.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.960
He's Edha too.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.297
This whole place is ours.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.258
Ours?

34:55.093 --> 34:56.511
Yours too.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.515
This is our new beginning, together.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.892
And I need you close.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.863
[Edha]  Fashion tries
to predict the future.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.408
Stop time, capture it.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.994
But our destinies
are unpredictable

35:22.078 --> 35:23.871
and no one knows what will come.

35:24.872 --> 35:27.458
Our lives can change at any time.

35:28.376 --> 35:31.838
In a second, in a minute.
Or in one look.

35:33.339 --> 35:36.926
We're victims
in this desperate battle against time.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.263
Winners and losers.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.599
We're prisoners of our nature.

35:44.225 --> 35:48.396
We cling to hate, revenge or success

35:48.479 --> 35:51.983
to get as far as we can,
as high as we can.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.319
To be first, to be the only ones.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.113
To start over.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.409
