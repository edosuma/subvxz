00:21.463 --> 00:24.327
Inspired by real events

03:34.231 --> 03:38.576
Eadweard

03:45.158 --> 03:46.525
Go.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.496
1.4. 1.4.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.532
It wants to be faster.

04:01.874 --> 04:04.543
Number three...
Three wants more distance.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.883
Or something crawling
under the wire.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.065
<i>Gentlemen and ladies,
the extraordinary,</i>

04:27.067 --> 04:30.936
<i>the incomparable,
the father of photography,</i>

04:30.938 --> 04:33.738
<i>I give you
Mr. Eadweard Muybridge!</i>

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
Thank you.

04:49.689 --> 04:55.961
I don't really have
much to say...

04:55.963 --> 04:58.671
I only wanted to show you this.

05:03.836 --> 05:07.506
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

05:21.822 --> 05:26.258
This... is life.

05:26.260 --> 05:30.028
Only to be repeated again

05:30.030 --> 05:32.764
and again,

05:32.766 --> 05:35.100
and again...

05:35.102 --> 05:38.169
And again.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.577
Thank you.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.288
You just showed them magic.
- I'm simply a photographer.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.823
Well, I've dabbled,
and ask my wife,

05:58.825 --> 06:02.027
my photos of our hounds
are definitely not magic.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.267
Let me ask you something.

06:04.145 --> 06:06.071
What made you think
of using 12 cameras?

06:07.033 --> 06:09.601
12 chances to win
Stanford's bet.

06:09.603 --> 06:13.004
And all over a bet you've
discovered motion? - Discovered?

06:13.006 --> 06:16.207
Now, how do you discover
something that's always been? - True.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.310
I'm just an amateur,

06:18.312 --> 06:21.843
but you know what would make
your images even better? - No, I don't.

06:21.878 --> 06:25.116
The sound of
the hooves. - Hooves?

06:25.118 --> 06:29.250
Now, why would we need that?
- That's life. It's the opera.

06:31.858 --> 06:36.194
"Neigh!"
- Right, well...

06:36.196 --> 06:38.295
I will think
about it. - Tom.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.068
Edison.
- Edison.

06:41.103 --> 06:43.935
And this is...
- Flora.

06:43.937 --> 06:48.139
Missus?
- Flora.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.599
I came to hire Mr.
Muybridge to take my portrait.

06:50.634 --> 06:54.088
Ah, well, I only do horses.

06:54.214 --> 06:58.193
Surely photographing a
lady is easier than a horse.

06:58.228 --> 07:01.853
Indeed. -If that would
make you more comfortable.

07:05.791 --> 07:08.094
You know, when I
was little, my father...

07:14.100 --> 07:17.568
When I was little, my father
taught me how to use a pinhole camera.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.937
I think my photos
might have rivalled these.

07:21.807 --> 07:23.875
Where was this one?

07:25.378 --> 07:27.912
North Alaska.
- Really Alaska?

07:27.914 --> 07:30.754
Or British Columbia.
- I want to go there.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.084
Let me see.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.242
Yes, that's British Columbia.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.319
I can smell the air there.
- Those are chemicals.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.361
It's so fresh.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.746
Hmm. That...

08:01.748 --> 08:05.527
That right there,
is now gone. - What is?

08:05.562 --> 08:07.879
That moment. I missed it.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.690
Everything slips by,
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

08:11.692 --> 08:15.207
I want to capture it,
before it's all gone. Sit.

08:16.062 --> 08:19.064
I...

08:19.066 --> 08:20.865
Would like to see
the in-between,

08:20.867 --> 08:22.901
to see what's invisible.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.938
I can't stop,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.966
and it's never enough.

08:32.878 --> 08:35.212
When is enough enough?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.948
I couldn't tell you.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.664
I always seem to want more.

08:43.457 --> 08:47.225
Do you know what
I mean? - Yes, I do.

08:49.895 --> 08:51.096
Good.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.447
If I could keep a camera on
you, Flora, for the rest of your life...

08:58.471 --> 09:02.133
Yes, that's better. I've
decided I'm not going to grow old.

09:03.164 --> 09:04.672
It's repulsive.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.560
Smile.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.915
It's all right.
- Eadweard? - It's done.

09:21.146 --> 09:22.856
Hey, Eadweard, come here.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.234
Magnesium.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.497
I used too much
magnesium. - Yes. Magnificent.

09:56.162 --> 09:59.030
You're watching me.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.468
I couldn't sleep.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.131
Try harder.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.540
I can't stop looking at you.

10:11.912 --> 10:15.963
This line here, those
lines there, these lines...

10:17.551 --> 10:21.085
You have good bones.

10:23.088 --> 10:27.125
I can't stop
looking at this line,

10:27.127 --> 10:31.930
this line, these lines.
- Stop. Stop...

10:43.242 --> 10:45.577
Hello?

10:45.579 --> 10:48.179
What are you doing?

10:48.181 --> 10:52.050
Saying hello to my boy.

10:53.153 --> 10:57.350
A boy?
- Yes.

10:58.023 --> 11:02.538
There's no one there.
You're as crazy as all get out.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.531
Eadweard, I have to fess up,

11:06.533 --> 11:09.133
after I saw you
take those horse photos,

11:09.135 --> 11:14.138
I travelled all the way
from San Francisco to here,

11:14.140 --> 11:16.274
plotting different
ways to be alone with you,

11:16.276 --> 11:18.618
and then I just
came up and asked.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.280
Is that strange?

11:23.883 --> 11:26.484
Perhaps.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.588
Well, you're probably a
bad judge of strange. - Yes.

11:30.656 --> 11:34.760
Where are we going next?
- You are married.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.630
I can marry again.

11:38.632 --> 11:44.302
<i>I was young, I was 16.</i>

11:44.304 --> 11:48.239
I can pick my
life now, I know that.

11:50.075 --> 11:52.343
You can?

11:54.947 --> 11:58.660
Eadweard, I am the most
interesting person you have ever met,

12:00.540 --> 12:01.882
and I'm yours...

12:03.222 --> 12:05.441
<i>And you're all mine.</i>

12:06.092 --> 12:09.661
The end.
- The end.

13:31.744 --> 13:35.646
So white...
Mister clouds.

13:35.648 --> 13:40.054
What is all this? Why
did it happen? - I didn't shave.

13:41.221 --> 13:45.012
No...
- What?

13:46.091 --> 13:49.594
I hate that
you make me ask.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.097
Your hair.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.610
Changing color, turning white?

13:56.368 --> 13:59.362
Maybe you just
got old instantly.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.073
Perhaps.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.644
<i>I guess things happen.</i>

14:06.646 --> 14:08.777
<i>Don't make much sense.</i>

14:09.549 --> 14:11.716
<i>There was a boy</i>

14:11.718 --> 14:14.114
<i>travelling with his
father on the stagecoach.</i>

14:17.589 --> 14:21.345
<i>And that boy
lost his father that day...</i>

14:23.396 --> 14:25.768
<i>And that boy is
all that's left of that man.</i>

14:30.203 --> 14:32.470
Hey, easy, girl, easy!

14:49.221 --> 14:51.823
<i>I woke up...</i>

14:51.825 --> 14:55.226
<i>Maybe days later.</i>

14:55.228 --> 14:58.162
<i>I'd lost my sense of taste,</i>

14:58.164 --> 15:01.265
<i>my smell, and sight.</i>

15:01.267 --> 15:03.234
<i>But it all slowly came back...</i>

15:04.636 --> 15:07.338
<i>Except the color of my hair.</i>

15:09.408 --> 15:12.110
<i>I don't know if my
mind ever recovered, Flora.</i>

15:13.579 --> 15:17.849
<i>But all I could think
about was that horse running,</i>

15:17.851 --> 15:20.718
<i>that flying horse...</i>

15:20.720 --> 15:24.522
As if time stopped.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.190
So, no, I do not know

15:26.192 --> 15:28.726
why things happen.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.701
Only god knows.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.736
Yes.

15:40.706 --> 15:44.409
I'd like to sit by the
window, please. - Of course.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.778
After you.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.482
Thank you.
- Yes.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.257
<i>Inside this book</i>

15:59.259 --> 16:02.493
you will only find
what a word means.

16:04.596 --> 16:05.730
With your hard-earned money,

16:05.732 --> 16:09.267
I know what a dollar
means in sweat and work,

16:09.269 --> 16:12.904
I will create the world's
first encyclopedia of motion,

16:12.906 --> 16:15.439
and show the
actions beneath the words.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.909
I intend to
photograph animal locomotion

16:17.911 --> 16:20.378
to discover how we move.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.513
Animals running?

16:22.515 --> 16:26.918
Yes, and walking, and jumping...

16:26.920 --> 16:30.688
I will not only photograph horses,
and domestic animals, and wild beasts,

16:30.690 --> 16:34.458
but people, like
yourselves, men and women

16:34.460 --> 16:38.362
during their daily activities and actions.
- How much do you need, Muybridge?

16:38.364 --> 16:41.566
50,000 $.
- 50,000!

16:41.568 --> 16:43.668
Preposterous!
- Come on!

16:43.670 --> 16:44.869
This is art, not science.

16:51.843 --> 16:54.994
Eadweard... Where are you
going? - To another university.

16:55.029 --> 16:57.682
They'll only ask you
the same questions.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.369
No one knows what you're
trying to do. You need to show them.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.554
If I get the money,
I could produce the photos.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.453
If you produce the photos,
they'll give you your money.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.993
Listen, I can
give you apprentices,

17:09.996 --> 17:11.776
and facilities
to get it started,

17:11.810 --> 17:14.773
so we can see the result.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.799
Those photographs will be my
photographs, with my name on them.

17:19.035 --> 17:24.026
They may be your photographs,
but this is my university, my reputation,

17:25.890 --> 17:28.794
So these photos will
represent us. Do I make myself clear?

17:33.253 --> 17:35.353
Flora...

17:35.355 --> 17:39.991
As I live and breathe.
Eadweard Muybridge.

17:39.993 --> 17:44.125
What a thrill to finally meet you
in the flesh. I have been awaiting the...

17:44.160 --> 17:49.134
Flora, are you all right? - I'm fine,
a bit flushed, but Thomas kept me company...

17:49.169 --> 17:52.039
Thomas Eakins.
The painter.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.470
Thomas Eakins? The...

17:54.674 --> 17:58.631
that the university has heard
about your husband. - Yes. Thank you.

17:58.666 --> 17:59.950
Not at all.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.662
I was just enlisting
Thomas's models for you.

18:02.682 --> 18:06.941
Models? Well, I don't
need models, I need people.

18:06.976 --> 18:11.956
Eadweard likes real real
life. - And real life is ugly.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.603
With the exception
of Mrs. Muybridge here.

18:15.427 --> 18:19.388
Flora. - Will you be
posing for his cameras, Flora?

18:19.423 --> 18:21.580
Oh, quite definitely.
- No.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.336
No? - Well, you come
pose for me if he won't let you.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.348
Nice to meet you.
- And you, sir.

18:29.474 --> 18:31.876
I love the idea of
being in one of his paintings.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.978
Oh, Flora, he is a man
who will only embellish.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.339
You think he
couldn't handle me?

18:36.482 --> 18:38.299
My love, he wouldn't
know which way was up.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.425
Stop.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.763
Open.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.435
What do you think?

18:59.571 --> 19:03.441
Looks like a field,
an old barn. - Yes.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.606
But do you like it?

19:07.346 --> 19:08.661
I love it.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.557
Outside all day long...

19:12.051 --> 19:13.965
I want to take
the pictures myself.

19:14.454 --> 19:18.389
Now, the actions are going to be
done out here. - Why do you need models

19:18.391 --> 19:21.922
when you can
photograph this? - Yes...

19:22.128 --> 19:25.554
But can you pick up a 40-pound
Boulder and throw it? Or pole vault?

19:25.589 --> 19:29.293
Yes, all of those things.
And a cartwheel, too!

19:29.601 --> 19:31.102
Hmm.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.806
I guess I don't need
anyone else. Come with me.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.469
What are you
going to make me do?

19:40.779 --> 19:42.397
Stay.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.498
I'm not one of
your horses. - I know.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.794
Now, when I say go,

19:48.829 --> 19:52.785
I want you to walk slowly
from here to that far end there.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.802
Are you ready?

19:58.697 --> 19:59.672
Go!

20:01.500 --> 20:03.280
Like this?
- Yes, keep going!

20:03.315 --> 20:05.136
Now, the cameras are going
to be here, here, here, and here,

20:05.138 --> 20:06.836
capturing your every move.

20:11.910 --> 20:15.178
You look like
a little boy. - I am.

20:15.782 --> 20:19.362
But did you see what you did there?
All those pictures are wasted, you see.

20:19.397 --> 20:21.712
Oh... - We have
to start all over again.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.537
Now...

20:39.539 --> 20:43.319
Which one of you
is Mr. Henry Bell? - I'm, sir.

20:43.354 --> 20:47.135
Now, I've heard you're
a good cook with chemicals?

20:47.170 --> 20:51.147
Well, I can't cook worth
a darn, but I know developing.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.880
You will be in charge
of chemicals and plates.

20:54.200 --> 20:58.189
Now, we only have enough silver
nitrate for ten series, which means...

20:58.191 --> 21:02.760
not a single
shot... can be wasted.

21:02.762 --> 21:06.255
Rondinella, electrics.
We will need 24 cameras.

21:06.290 --> 21:09.760
Holy shit. Where are we
going to find 24 cameras?

21:10.069 --> 21:13.091
We are going
to build them. - Holy shit.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.826
Who are you?

21:15.841 --> 21:18.464
I'm... Jay Liberty Tadd.

21:18.845 --> 21:22.645
Just a big fat honour, sir.
I went into art because of your photos.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.217
Yosemite, the railroads, just...
- Yes, yes, yes.

21:26.184 --> 21:28.822
This is science.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.688
What is it you do?

21:32.225 --> 21:35.119
I don't know.
- Can you find us volunteers?

21:35.628 --> 21:38.355
Well, my fiancee works at
the zoological gardens. - Good.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.147
Find us our subjects, then.

21:49.508 --> 21:50.821
Go.

22:01.953 --> 22:03.754
What's wrong?

22:03.756 --> 22:07.259
These are our
first subjects? - Uh, yes.

22:07.260 --> 22:10.779
It says here, "pigs running."
- These pigs won't work.

22:12.698 --> 22:15.698
I was thinking we would start
with something with a bit more bang.

22:15.801 --> 22:18.625
Well, it took me a lot longer
than expected to get these pigs.

22:18.660 --> 22:22.104
No elephants? - No.
- Monkeys swinging? - No...

22:22.575 --> 22:24.512
Men wrestling,
women jumping? - Uh...

22:24.644 --> 22:27.961
So this is all you found?

22:27.996 --> 22:30.175
Yes.
They were hard to get.

22:30.210 --> 22:32.910
Nobody wanted to give us pigs.
I really thought they would please everyone.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.243
Tadd, you're on electrics. Rondinella,
you've been promoted to subjects.

22:36.278 --> 22:40.190
Yes, sir.
Ooh, fired.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.836
You'll get 'em next job, Tadd.

22:43.995 --> 22:45.701
Here.

22:49.734 --> 22:51.100
Get ready, piggies.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.933
You're going for a run.

22:53.805 --> 22:57.715
All right! Let's get these
subjects moving into position. Go.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.164
We have to move quickly.

23:01.179 --> 23:04.239
I'll take that.
- Are we set?

23:04.274 --> 23:06.984
Electrics?
- Plates are set.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.382
Good.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.857
Pig, pig, pig, pig...
- Go.

23:16.294 --> 23:20.164
No, no, no!
- Reset. - Get them.

23:25.003 --> 23:26.120
I don't think
they like carrots.

23:27.544 --> 23:29.454
How about "man
chasing a pig with a stick"?

23:31.810 --> 23:33.662
Let's go again.

23:36.381 --> 23:37.804
Let me try.

23:38.817 --> 23:41.986
Let's get this.
Come, come, come, come.

23:45.123 --> 23:48.092
All right.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.729
Here we go, this way...
Go!

23:54.332 --> 23:56.137
Did we get it?

23:56.401 --> 23:58.257
Plates weren't set, sir.

24:02.007 --> 24:05.345
All right, no more animals, we need
a human before the end of the day.

24:16.721 --> 24:19.723
It's perfect,
Flora. It's you.

24:19.725 --> 24:20.945
We'll take it.

24:24.261 --> 24:25.132
Wait.

24:27.324 --> 24:29.132
Just... pull it back up
for one second, my flower.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.372
Please.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.906
Stop.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.243
Slide it off again.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.828
Yes...

24:45.794 --> 24:49.211
Can we photograph this?
I'm going to come model this...

24:49.246 --> 24:50.922
No, no, no, Flora,
this is not a study.

24:50.957 --> 24:55.107
Now, just slide it off
one more time, up and down.

24:56.728 --> 25:00.717
One more time, just... - Eadweard...
- slide - the moment is gone.

25:01.033 --> 25:01.891
No...

25:04.803 --> 25:07.106
Flora...
- It's still not right.

25:09.931 --> 25:10.758
We'll take it.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.934
Who is she?
- Tadd's fiancee.

25:18.969 --> 25:20.300
She's a kid.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.853
Yeah, I think she's
his cousin, too. - Cousin?

25:24.356 --> 25:26.669
Second cousins, maybe.
What will her action be?

25:30.061 --> 25:32.261
"Woman walking."

25:32.865 --> 25:34.493
So moving slower than a pig.

25:36.334 --> 25:38.156
Let's get a practice first.

25:45.343 --> 25:46.907
You are number two.

25:48.788 --> 25:51.983
I'm not sure... - No, I'm
telling you, you're number two.

25:52.096 --> 25:53.971
She's number two, the
pigs were number one, 

25:54.308 --> 25:55.087
she is number two.

25:55.955 --> 25:59.869
It's just a few paces, when I say
go, you go from there to there. Simple.

25:59.904 --> 26:00.919
Easy.

26:05.396 --> 26:06.489
Standing by.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.205
Plates set. - Are
you ready, number two?

26:13.877 --> 26:14.891
Go.

26:17.809 --> 26:21.068
No, stop!
Stop.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.332
What are you doing?
Right, we can't use that one.

26:24.984 --> 26:28.322
We running out of plates, sir enough
left for one series... - Yes, yes, yes, I know.

26:28.921 --> 26:32.328
What were you doing?
- Walking. - No, you weren't walking,

26:32.525 --> 26:34.417
you were stopping
along the way.

26:35.827 --> 26:36.980
What would
you like I to do?

26:37.015 --> 26:38.811
What do you mean
what I would like you to do?

26:38.998 --> 26:44.013
I would like you to walk.
- Just walk? - Yes, just walk.

26:44.048 --> 26:48.493
When is the picture taken? - As you
walk. - At what point? - At all points!

26:48.841 --> 26:54.954
There, there, there, and there!
All down the line! - I see. - Yes.

26:55.548 --> 26:57.522
It's simple.
You go from here...

27:01.153 --> 27:02.871
To there.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.071
Like this?

27:10.061 --> 27:12.813
No, no, no,
not so self-consciously.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.245
Let your arms swing
naturally. Come back, try again.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.837
Go.

27:19.370 --> 27:21.525
No, just let your
arms swing. All right...

27:22.208 --> 27:27.342
Stop trying to walk and walk,
walk, walk! Walk! - I am walking.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.318
I'm sorry, she's just nervous.
Don't be nervous, sweetie!

27:35.119 --> 27:38.804
When I tap my head, you
take the photo. Do you understand?

27:38.839 --> 27:40.916
Yes.
- Good.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.940
Number two, you're done.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.506
I have one series left,
and I can't waste it on you.

27:45.598 --> 27:49.618
I'm sorry, I can get this.
- No, I don't think you can.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.818
Complete!

28:07.703 --> 28:08.487
Thank you.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.350
That was a good walk.

28:15.393 --> 28:17.524
I'm actually proud
of you, honey. Good job.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.399
Eadweard, this
is not a good time.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.205
Any takers?

28:48.427 --> 28:50.264
We need examples of athleticism.

28:59.170 --> 29:02.079
I'm looking for
animals to photograph.

29:02.114 --> 29:03.805
Well, we got lots
of those, all right.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.627
I'd like to bring this
bear to my studio nearby,

29:06.662 --> 29:09.074
it's not far from here,
and take a series of photographs,

29:09.262 --> 29:11.619
and then bring him back,
it only takes few hours.

29:11.812 --> 29:13.699
How much would
something like that trouble you?

29:13.986 --> 29:16.915
Not sure.
- Would 50 $ suit you?

29:16.950 --> 29:18.675
50 $?
- Good.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.482
What else do you have here?
- Well, what do you want?

29:21.694 --> 29:24.895
Elephants? - Yes, over there.
- Tigers? Lions? Eagles?

29:25.030 --> 29:27.492
Yes, sir, we got 'em all.
- I will take them all, then.

29:27.527 --> 29:30.861
For 50 $?
- 50 $ apiece.

29:32.470 --> 29:36.947
What's your name, sir?
- Noah. Filling up my ark.

29:58.062 --> 30:00.430
Eadweard, what are you
doing with him? - I need a cat.

30:14.445 --> 30:17.581
Two men fighting in a battle...

30:20.752 --> 30:22.185
Woman falling on ground.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.555
Lifting...

30:25.557 --> 30:29.226
Lifting, lifting, lifting...
Log.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.162
Man fighting.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.297
Man dancing.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.701
Man performing handstand.

31:00.224 --> 31:02.526
New series.

31:04.228 --> 31:07.097
Are we set?
- Plates are set.

31:07.099 --> 31:10.567
Electrics.
Go!

31:12.570 --> 31:14.271
Complete.

31:14.273 --> 31:17.074
Let's set up for a new series.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.679
Men boxing.

31:28.252 --> 31:31.288
What's wrong, Tadd?
- Something on the lens, sir.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.624
Again?
- New series.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.627
Go!

31:39.330 --> 31:40.330
Go!

32:20.872 --> 32:22.906
Complete.
- Complete!

32:22.908 --> 32:25.408
Complete!
- Complete!

33:02.748 --> 33:05.482
Flora?

33:07.619 --> 33:08.919
Flora...

33:23.234 --> 33:25.335
Flora? Flora!

33:26.270 --> 33:27.971
Flora, open the door!

33:39.951 --> 33:42.719
How could I not know?

33:48.226 --> 33:50.727
We'll have another.

34:49.954 --> 34:51.888
Flora, what are you doing?

34:51.889 --> 34:56.668
I was imagining
I was in these moments.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.863
Which?

34:59.865 --> 35:02.899
Alaska, San Francisco,

35:02.901 --> 35:06.436
British Columbia...

35:08.572 --> 35:10.740
Like memory, Flora?

35:10.742 --> 35:13.810
No.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.880
Are you there now?

35:16.882 --> 35:21.084
Yes.

35:21.086 --> 35:25.355
How do we go there?

35:25.357 --> 35:30.060
Pennsylvania isn't
where I imagined us starting.

35:30.062 --> 35:32.395
It will only take a couple
of months to finish these studies.

35:32.397 --> 35:35.332
Then we can go
wherever you choose.

35:35.334 --> 35:38.323
Once I get the money,
I'll take you into town.

35:55.786 --> 35:58.722
What the heck do
we call that last series?

35:58.724 --> 36:01.124
It's simple, bell.
What did we just shoot?

36:01.126 --> 36:04.627
A man walking a goat.

36:04.629 --> 36:08.131
That's your title, then.
"A man  walking a goat."

36:08.133 --> 36:10.667
Yes. - What
would you have next?

36:10.669 --> 36:13.570
We have dogs and
chickens, performing mule,

36:13.572 --> 36:16.005
woman climbs ladder.
- I think it's a little arbitrary.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.141
Nothing is arbitrary.

36:18.143 --> 36:21.678
We need to get them all,
all of them. Which one's ready?

36:21.680 --> 36:24.776
I have no idea.
It's impossible to keep track.

36:24.983 --> 36:28.399
How would I know how
he wants me to climb a ladder.

36:28.453 --> 36:31.687
I've never climbed one
till now. - You just climb.

36:31.757 --> 36:34.359
Up, down. Up,
down. It's simple.

36:34.659 --> 36:36.855
"Up down, up down, simple."

36:36.928 --> 36:40.407
I like that, Eadweard. I'm
writing it down. I'm writing an article.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.376
Name's Harry.
Harry Larkyns.

36:44.835 --> 36:48.602
On me, or on this? - On you, of couse.
I'm the theatre critic from the post.

36:48.637 --> 36:51.141
Oh. The theatre.
I don't do theatre.

36:51.143 --> 36:52.771
I find it all a bit false.

36:54.111 --> 36:57.715
Oh, but you do.
Who wouldn't pay a pretty penny

36:57.750 --> 37:00.258
to watch you do your
work, eat your lemons?

37:00.919 --> 37:02.249
It's better than theatre.

37:11.195 --> 37:12.374
Excuse me?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.832
Who are you?

37:16.734 --> 37:19.169
I'm number 33.

37:19.171 --> 37:22.138
No, what is
your name? - Mary.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.937
Mary.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.963
Mary is our next series. She's a
bit taller than what we've set up for.

37:28.998 --> 37:30.122
Let's adjust the levels.

37:30.157 --> 37:32.955
What's the lens at? - It's at
85. - Let's bring it down to 75.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.538
Are you ready
with the watch? - Yes.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.555
Right. Mary.
Tall.

37:38.857 --> 37:41.420
About... 24.

37:41.455 --> 37:44.867
I'm 20.
- Correction, 20.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.491
And, uh, petite
or medium build?

37:48.567 --> 37:51.410
Petite. - There's a
cloud! We have to go.

37:51.445 --> 37:52.824
Petite. - What
would you like?

37:53.738 --> 37:55.120
Hmm.

38:04.114 --> 38:06.666
Woman jumping over the stool.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.928
Are you ready?
- Grand. - Perfect.

38:19.096 --> 38:20.440
Go.

38:23.234 --> 38:27.237
Perfect.
- The theatre.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.797
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:06.277 --> 39:09.279
Where are you coming
from, Harry? - California.

39:09.281 --> 39:11.659
What, for the rush?
For the gold rush?

39:12.117 --> 39:14.140
No, I went for the
adventure. I missed all the gold.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.926
Look at all these bloody things
that we do, huh? Every moment.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.316
Yes,

39:22.627 --> 39:24.620
and we're never truly still.

39:27.064 --> 39:30.517
Think about it.
I'm asking you.

39:33.771 --> 39:36.173
Even at rest,
we're constantly moving,

39:37.008 --> 39:38.494
until we die.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.453
So are you dissecting life?

39:41.488 --> 39:44.083
The movement that makes up life.

39:45.683 --> 39:48.885
<i>We're taught to
love pretty things</i>

39:48.887 --> 39:53.122
<i>and have forgotten the
beauty in pouring a cup of tea,</i>

39:53.124 --> 39:55.959
<i>or...</i>

39:55.961 --> 39:58.027
<i>The poetry in
lifting an umbrella,</i>

39:58.029 --> 40:00.537
<i>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</i>

40:19.750 --> 40:23.225
<i>I want to create something
that's never been seen before.</i>

40:23.321 --> 40:27.097
<i>These have a life hereafter.</i>

40:29.160 --> 40:31.001
They are my children.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.463
They are forever.

40:36.033 --> 40:38.477
What else is there,

40:39.070 --> 40:40.197
after you die?

40:42.374 --> 40:44.391
That's fascinating.
That is fascinating.

40:44.709 --> 40:48.695
I'm writing that words for words.
- Oh, you've not written a word.

40:49.381 --> 40:50.791
I write the ones I remember.

41:15.673 --> 41:18.107
I'm keen to be
in one of your studies.

41:18.109 --> 41:21.077
Could I volunteer?

41:24.114 --> 41:27.250
What can you do?
- I can fence.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.819
Fence?
- Fence.

41:38.062 --> 41:40.363
Is that a challenge?
- Well, that depends

41:40.365 --> 41:44.001
if you're going to
let me volunteer. - All right.

42:26.844 --> 42:28.911
Flora?

42:29.813 --> 42:32.381
I came to model.

42:42.192 --> 42:46.162
Flora... - Don't
look at me like that.

42:46.164 --> 42:49.499
Like what?
- Like that.

42:49.501 --> 42:52.001
With all that judgment.

42:52.003 --> 42:56.038
I'm your...
I'm your wife.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.509
I'm your wife.
- Stop it, Flora.

42:59.511 --> 43:03.146
That's five miles, Flora.
What were you thinking?

43:03.148 --> 43:06.182
No, don't touch me.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.985
Listen, Flora, this is
not you. No, stop it. Stop it...

43:08.987 --> 43:12.889
This isn't you. This
isn't you... Stop. Stop!

43:12.891 --> 43:15.491
Eadweard...
- No!

43:15.493 --> 43:18.427
No! No...
No. No...

43:18.429 --> 43:21.130
No! Stop it!

43:21.132 --> 43:24.968
Stop it. Stop it...
Stop it.

43:29.239 --> 43:30.873
Shh...

43:33.544 --> 43:37.346
Flora.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.182
My Flora...

43:45.889 --> 43:47.290
Sir?

43:54.031 --> 43:56.866
Sir...

43:56.868 --> 43:59.235
I can't.

44:01.438 --> 44:04.974
Sir, next model's
refusing to come out.

44:04.976 --> 44:08.044
Did he say why?
- He insists on speaking with you

44:08.046 --> 44:11.480
right now. - Well, he's
going to have to wait.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.550
I need to take Flora home.
I'm headed back into town.

44:14.552 --> 44:17.920
I could see her home safe.

44:17.922 --> 44:21.591
That wouldn't trouble
you? - No trouble at all.

44:21.593 --> 44:23.459
Much obliged.

44:27.197 --> 44:29.966
We're going to
lose our light, sir.

44:29.968 --> 44:31.934
Sir?

44:33.036 --> 44:35.304
Yes...
- Where is he?

44:35.306 --> 44:37.206
Around back.

46:25.483 --> 46:27.003
There's no way
that watch can be right.

46:28.185 --> 46:29.185
No, maybe not.

46:33.357 --> 46:34.557
Here, this is more like it.

46:34.559 --> 46:38.227
That doesn't change
the fact that it's very late.

46:38.229 --> 46:39.996
Shh...

46:43.633 --> 46:47.036
Well, you owe
Mr. Larkyns some gratitude.

46:47.038 --> 46:49.105
Oh, do I?

46:49.107 --> 46:52.041
We waited for you here,

46:52.043 --> 46:54.143
but Mr. Larkyns
had to review a play,

46:54.145 --> 46:57.213
so I insisted he escort
me to the theatre tonight.

46:57.215 --> 47:00.649
It was a dreadful show, wasn't it?
- Do you know what time it is?

47:00.651 --> 47:03.586
I do because I just asked.
It's a quarter of midnight.

47:03.588 --> 47:05.388
No, it's 2:30.

47:05.390 --> 47:08.657
Not according to his watch.

47:08.659 --> 47:11.260
Good night, Harry.

47:11.262 --> 47:13.195
I'm very sorry
for your troubles.

47:13.197 --> 47:15.498
Oh, no trouble, really.

47:20.404 --> 47:22.371
It is a dreadful
timepiece, she's right.

47:22.373 --> 47:24.493
I'm afraid the Americans
haven't figured out how to...

47:27.711 --> 47:31.313
I would never wish to be
the cause of such a misunderstanding

47:31.315 --> 47:34.283
between a husband and his
wife, Eadweard, so, with all due respect,

47:34.285 --> 47:37.586
I'm going to take my
leave now. My watch?

47:39.523 --> 47:42.425
You know what, Eadweard,
you keep it. A gift.

47:42.427 --> 47:45.628
A gentleman's understanding.
I do fear it's broken, though.

47:45.630 --> 47:47.196
I'm quite certain

47:47.198 --> 47:49.799
there's no way it
can be before midnight.

47:49.801 --> 47:53.269
A watch can be repaired.

47:53.271 --> 47:54.804
Indeed.

48:25.636 --> 48:30.506
So, you'll just walk,
meet, and partially turn.

48:30.508 --> 48:33.342
All right.
Okay, follow me.

48:36.713 --> 48:40.416
Stand right here...
And we'll have you here.

48:40.418 --> 48:42.485
Thank you.
Fine.

48:42.487 --> 48:45.754
Just a moment.
Go.

48:50.327 --> 48:52.528
Complete.

49:21.625 --> 49:24.360
We are going to reset!

49:24.362 --> 49:28.197
Let's get number 74 and 75 back here!
Put the cameras back on their marks!

49:28.199 --> 49:30.699
It's fine, sir, we've
got it, we can move on...

49:30.701 --> 49:32.434
We didn't get it!
- What didn't we get?

49:32.436 --> 49:35.171
I can't see their actions, their
movements! - You should tell the subjects that.

49:35.173 --> 49:37.273
It means... I can't see
the movement of the legs,

49:37.275 --> 49:41.243
the waist, the bodies! I can't see
the motion with their dresses and layers

49:41.245 --> 49:44.280
and skirts in the way! - Well, how
do you expect ladies to be dress?

49:45.715 --> 49:48.884
How do you expect animals to
be dressed? - People aren't animals.

49:48.886 --> 49:50.186
What are we, then?

49:52.322 --> 49:54.323
Fine.

49:55.392 --> 49:59.328
74 and 75! - What
do you mean, naked?

49:59.330 --> 50:01.730
Yes. For the study
of the movement. - No.

50:01.732 --> 50:03.399
No.

50:06.269 --> 50:09.538
From this moment forward,
we only photograph nude subjects!

50:09.540 --> 50:12.909
Hold on a second.
Naked studies?

50:13.944 --> 50:16.912
In front of the camera,

50:16.914 --> 50:18.914
there is only action.

50:18.916 --> 50:22.418
That will discredit
all of our work.

50:22.420 --> 50:26.388
An action of naked women?
- And of men, too?

50:26.390 --> 50:29.391
This is science!
- Yes, agreed.

50:29.393 --> 50:33.996
we're just going to help
you photograph erotic photos...

50:33.998 --> 50:35.331
I am an honest man.

50:35.333 --> 50:38.601
Don't be so ignorant, bell.

50:40.270 --> 50:41.270
And you, Rondinella?

50:42.772 --> 50:45.241
Tadd, they'll kick us out.

50:49.379 --> 50:50.946
Damn all of you.

52:43.060 --> 52:45.494
Any luck?
- None.

53:00.577 --> 53:03.879
Eadweard, there ain't no
goddamn way I'm going out there...

53:03.881 --> 53:05.147
Like this.

53:05.149 --> 53:08.384
What is your concern?

53:08.386 --> 53:09.551
It's a diaper.

53:09.553 --> 53:12.654
It's a goddamn diaper.

53:12.656 --> 53:16.558
It's a pelvis cloth.
It's called a pelvis cloth.

53:16.560 --> 53:20.028
I look like a straight
ol' dick. - Well...

53:20.030 --> 53:22.097
We need to see the body.

53:22.099 --> 53:24.733
You got any
idea what'll happen

53:24.735 --> 53:27.035
if I wore a
diaper while I worked?

53:28.405 --> 53:32.107
Hot metal, Eadweard.
I work with hot metal.

53:34.078 --> 53:36.845
Let me speak plainly to you.
These photographs will be seen

53:36.847 --> 53:40.416
by the world,
scientists, doctors,

53:40.418 --> 53:43.452
dancers, artists,
detectives...

53:43.454 --> 53:46.822
Some goddamn artist's
gonna paint a picture,

53:46.824 --> 53:48.957
and everybody gonna
be wearing diapers?

53:48.959 --> 53:50.826
Well, I sincerely doubt it,

53:50.828 --> 53:54.096
but they will have an
excellent example of form,

53:54.098 --> 53:58.834
an exquisite specimen, if I may,

53:58.836 --> 54:02.037
of a strong,
masterful blacksmith.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.544
Shall we, then?

54:13.116 --> 54:14.583
It's a goddamn
diaper, Eadweard.

54:15.485 --> 54:17.886
Only if you fill it with shit.

54:22.892 --> 54:25.160
Dammit.
- Are we ready?

54:25.162 --> 54:27.196
Ready.
Electrics.

54:27.198 --> 54:29.198
Sir, we're losing the light.

54:30.834 --> 54:33.569
Will this work?
Hurry!

54:36.473 --> 54:39.641
Go. Go!

54:39.643 --> 54:42.811
Action!
Do your action!

54:42.813 --> 54:43.879
Do it!

54:52.222 --> 54:55.491
Did we get the
series? - We got it.

55:01.898 --> 55:04.032
Thank you.

55:09.606 --> 55:11.507
You can go.

55:26.155 --> 55:29.625
Eadweard, I heard
you've been shut down.

55:29.627 --> 55:33.562
No, no, we're just... We're
running a little short on volunteers

55:33.564 --> 55:35.864
at the studio.

55:35.866 --> 55:39.067
Uninhibited women.

55:39.069 --> 55:40.836
I think that's what
you're asking for, am I right?

55:40.838 --> 55:44.139
Listen, I'm not looking for...

55:44.141 --> 55:48.076
I need to see the movement,
Thomas. I need to see...

55:48.078 --> 55:51.547
I can pay. - No, no, this
is not a brothel, Eadweard.

55:51.549 --> 55:54.016
The women and men
are here for the art,

55:54.018 --> 55:56.685
for the thrill.
And I just have to say,

55:56.687 --> 55:59.721
my lord, you are in
incredible shape. - Do you mind if I...

55:59.723 --> 56:02.658
Stop it.
- I beg your pardon,

56:02.660 --> 56:05.961
but I am a tremendous
connoisseur of the human body.

56:05.963 --> 56:09.831
Look, I'm fairly certainI can persuade
them, and I will send you some models

56:09.833 --> 56:11.833
on the condition
that I can model for you.

56:19.075 --> 56:22.077
All right then. And perhaps
you can model for me sometime?

56:22.079 --> 56:24.112
Like this? - Very
nice. Okay, hold that.

56:24.114 --> 56:25.180
Eadweard?

56:38.294 --> 56:40.295
Flora...
- Eadweard...

56:40.297 --> 56:42.998
What are you doing?
- All right, all right.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.800
Muybridge!

56:47.704 --> 56:50.872
Flora! - His models
aren't as refined as you.

56:50.874 --> 56:54.376
You're decent!
Spontaneous!

56:54.378 --> 56:56.912
Feminine! - You see
me that way, they don't.

56:56.914 --> 56:59.247
I don't want them
to look at you that way.

56:59.249 --> 57:03.185
It's indecent.
- That's you. That's your mind.

57:03.187 --> 57:05.787
In my mind, I'm not being
indecent. You're putting that on me!

57:05.789 --> 57:08.156
I am protecting you.
- Protecting me?

57:08.158 --> 57:10.659
From whom, Eadweard?

57:10.661 --> 57:13.161
Eakins.
- Eakins?

57:13.163 --> 57:16.198
Him?
- Yes.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.934
Are you kidding? What
about your models? - Subjects.

57:18.936 --> 57:21.103
It's the same goddamn thing.

57:21.105 --> 57:24.906
You just want to see them naked.
- It's not about seeing them nude,

57:24.908 --> 57:26.308
it's about the
movement of the body!

57:27.377 --> 57:31.847
If it is about the
movement, then let me model.

57:39.222 --> 57:41.857
Let me model.

57:47.030 --> 57:50.098
You can't answer, can you?

57:50.100 --> 57:51.299
I just wonder

57:51.301 --> 57:56.004
where all the ugly
women in your studies are.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.902
Where were you?

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.540
What are you doing?
- Where were you planning on going?

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:14.843
You broke open the lock?
- Are you planning a trip?

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:18.380
This is mine.
- Answer me.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.918
You don't trust me.

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:29.558
You've packed a trunk full
of your clothes. What am I to think?

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.994
That I'm running away?

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:36.264
Maybe I should.
Maybe I should go,

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:37.999
rather than live
like this. - Like what?

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.534
By myself!

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:44.339
You don't exist. You're like one
of your goddamn pictures, Eadweard.

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:46.241
For good reason, it seems.

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:48.977
Now, where were
you planning on going?

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:54.082
Where?
- I'm pregnant.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.254
I'm pregnant.

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:07.095
I was packing up the things
that wouldn't fit anymore.

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:14.002
Flora, my flower...

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:51.006
Hey, we got one of
Eakins' models here today.

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:53.541
She's been waiting
over an hour. - Right, right.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.978
No, no, you're not hearing
me. One of...  Eakins' models.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.380
Yes?

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:02.017
Really?

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:04.185
Oh, yes, that's good.

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:06.254
Good, good.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:11.960
My apologies for keeping you
waiting. - What would you like me to do?

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.562
Do?

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:19.167
Sweep. - Yes, you
will sweep, sweep.

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:23.471
Sweep without any
clothes on? Naked, right?

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:27.409
Nude, yes. - Aren't you wanting
to see something more exciting?

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:30.378
Oh, this is exciting.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:34.215
If you say so. Would
you like to practice one?

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.551
No, I don't need to.
I know how to sweep.

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:37.619
All right.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.962
Do you want me
to undress now? - Yes.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:48.965
We're ready.
Are you ready?

01:02:56.505 --> 01:02:58.306
Uh... should we leave?

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:26.067
All right.
Wait!

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.749
Ready.
Electrics.

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:43.351
Go!

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:48.590
Hold! Hold!
Expose the plates.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.528
This will just take a moment.

01:03:58.067 --> 01:04:00.435
So... What's
your background?

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:02.404
Irish.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.107
Right.

01:04:10.212 --> 01:04:13.381
We're ready.
- Thank you.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.788
Go.

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:26.628
And complete.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.134
Oh, right.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:41.109
Here you go.
And thank you.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:44.145
It was nice meeting you.
- Bye-bye.

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:49.350
Thank you.
Bye.

01:04:57.593 --> 01:05:00.562
Eh... that was good.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:02.397
Go.

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.537
Complete.
Did we get it?

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:44.706
Can we do it again?
- No.

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:49.577
We're missing some plates.
Sir, we're missing  plates from the darkroom.

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:51.746
What? - I think
someone stole them.

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:54.516
I don't know.
Which ones?

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:57.552
Some of the nude series.
- The female ones?

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:00.221
Bloody hell.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:49.737
What's the next series?
- Woman pouring a bucket of water

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:53.374
over a seated
companion. - Good.

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.476
Hold! You do
not have approval

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:59.881
to continue
taking lewd photos!

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:10.525
I wasn't looking for approval.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.660
Well, you should have, because I'm
shutting you down. Are we set?

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:15.964
Electrics. - This is a
university, not a whore house,

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:18.366
where all patrons...

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:20.468
Male patrons...

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.637
Photograph
their self-indulgences!

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:25.540
I'm afraid you are
seeing this in the wrong light.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.676
We see it in the light
and glory of our Lord. - No...

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:32.247
Science. - Science
has nothing to learn

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:33.681
from the wiggle
of a naked girl's behind!

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:36.651
I strip away the
clothes not to see the flesh,

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:37.919
but to better
see the motion.

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:40.955
I would strip away the
flesh to see the muscle,

01:07:40.957 --> 01:07:44.392
then strip muscle to see bone.
I'd even throw away the very skeleton

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:47.328
to see the
essence of an action.

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:49.497
That is what I'm interested in.

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:54.002
Your nonsense only
affirms your madness.

01:07:54.004 --> 01:07:55.004
You're right.

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.842
Eadweard, don't.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:08.383
Hold on.
- Don't do this.

01:08:08.385 --> 01:08:11.786
Setting up for a new series!

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:14.956
What's the subject?
- Man, walking.

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:16.791
Age 50.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:20.328
You have a run of the
devil in you, Eadweard. - Yes.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:25.066
Stop this!
Oh, my god...

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:28.036
I will not be taken
advantage of here! Go!

01:08:55.863 --> 01:08:58.832
Eadweard, may I enter?

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:02.670
Who is it?
- Mary.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:05.006
Number 33?

01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:07.809
I came back to model.

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:12.380
I've covered the plates.
You can open the flap.

01:09:18.122 --> 01:09:19.020
I'd like you

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:23.725
to wear this around
your waist for tomorrow.

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:26.694
This stick?

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:29.397
Yes. For practice.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:32.066
I can show you.

01:09:34.536 --> 01:09:36.069
Come.

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:42.143
Turn around.
This stick

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:46.913
will analyze the
movement of your hips.

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.718
The stick will swing,

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.688
revealing the precise angle,

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.624
and perhaps...

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:59.560
We'll discover
the formula for grace.

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:02.997
You think you can make
the formula for anything?

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.970
I never thought I was the
type of girl to do something like this.

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:13.875
I realized today I haven't
been inspired by anything

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:16.144
or anyone in so long,

01:10:16.146 --> 01:10:19.414
until all this, and...
You.

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.918
I keep talking

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.723
because I'm not sure if you're
going to or not. Talk, I mean.

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:33.127
I guess I'll take
my clothes off now.

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:34.562
Yes.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.166
Out there.

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:01.789
Was someone
just here? - No.

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:03.958
I heard footsteps.

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:30.518
There was no
one here, Eadweard.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:34.722
I know what I heard.

01:12:15.063 --> 01:12:17.298
What is this one,
and why is she dressed?

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:21.903
Sir, this is "an
unmarried woman undresses."

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:25.673
Are we ready, then?
Electrics.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:26.974
Go ahead.

01:13:25.368 --> 01:13:28.336
Why are you
always staring?

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:32.139
It's beautiful.

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.777
It's strange.

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:39.113
It's strange, Eadweard.

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:41.315
I can't tell if
you're looking at me, or...

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:44.986
I don't know.
- Looking at what?

01:13:44.988 --> 01:13:47.355
Jesus, I don't know.

01:13:47.357 --> 01:13:51.025
Examining how I move?
- Like a study?

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:52.360
Like one of your
studies, Eadweard?

01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:56.831
If you're going to
photograph me then photograph me,

01:13:56.833 --> 01:14:00.768
or go photograph
your naked girls.

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:04.972
You have carrot
in your beard.

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:10.011
What? - We had
carrots on Monday.

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:12.013
It's Thursday.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:16.984
I think I could be
this pregnant forever.

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:20.287
I've never been this warm.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.057
It's this little baby,

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:26.293
like a little pot
of tea in my belly.

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:42.376
Eadweard...
Eadweard?

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:50.918
I'm sorry.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.020
I just need to
finish these studies.

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:55.322
I need more.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:58.325
I will take you
back to San Francisco

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.361
and have our
boy see our ocean.

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:03.431
I promise.

01:15:03.433 --> 01:15:05.866
I like it here.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:09.804
I do. I don't need the ocean.

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.257
Oh!

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:08.362
Muybridge.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.131
Did you see each other?

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:13.200
Did I see who?
- Flora.

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:15.903
Flora?
Are you crazy?

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.272
Answer me.
Did you see her?

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:22.042
Step aside.
- Hey, fancy a smoke?

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:27.181
You stay away from my wife.

01:16:27.183 --> 01:16:29.950
Oh, you've got it
all wrong, my man.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.088
If I ever see you again,

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:38.425
I assure you it
will be for the last time.

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:45.332
Is that all right with you?

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:47.802
Perfectly.

01:17:11.459 --> 01:17:15.462
<i>I have the church group,</i>

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.464
<i>and the investors.</i>

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.867
<i>Your naked men and women</i>

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:22.536
<i>running around my campus...</i>

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:26.173
<i>However, I no longer have
the resources to defend myself</i>

01:17:26.175 --> 01:17:29.143
<i>or you anymore.</i>

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:32.480
I already told you this.
It's time to print.

01:17:33.915 --> 01:17:35.983
I'm not asking here.

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:39.320
Eadweard?

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:41.455
Is everything
all right with you?

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.168
Let's shoot.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:58.606
I said, are
we ready, Tadd?

01:17:58.608 --> 01:18:01.542
Eadweard, we can't
waltz without music.

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.913
Someone sing a damn song.

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:39.113
Oh, the latch is stuck...
Dammit.

01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:42.549
Did you want something
different? - Sir!  - Let me try.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.952
Get your hand out of
the way- what's happened?

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:46.654
Get down out of the way.

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:50.057
Makes you wonder
if there's a better system.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:53.928
I think I know how it goes,
being the fucking inventor!

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:59.133
Ah!

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:04.104
Sir, are you all right?
What happened?

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:07.107
Get off.
- Can you...

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:10.010
Can you take your hand
away? We need to look at it.

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:16.650
Sir, sit in the chair,
please? - Thank you.

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:20.087
Get me a smoke!

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:24.692
What else?
What else, we need more.

01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:26.627
Chopping up food?
- No.

01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:30.397
Man... crawls under a
chair, and partially turns...

01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:33.167
No, we did that one.
- Whipping someone?

01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:35.602
No.
Stay still.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.973
Spinning a top? - No.
What about what we're doing now?

01:19:38.975 --> 01:19:42.142
What?
Sitting, standing?

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:44.211
Talking. We're
talking to each other.

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:47.681
We have no photos of that.
- And what is the action?

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:49.016
The action is talking, arguing.

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:52.186
You can't see talking.

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:53.554
How about using the toilet?

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:57.691
I don't know, a
woman using the toilet?

01:19:57.693 --> 01:19:59.126
That's something
we do every day.

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:02.029
So, what is the series,
Rondinella? Tell me.

01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:05.466
Oh, I don't know.
- Oh, stop it.

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:11.338
I'm asking you.
What is it

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.641
you're trying to see? What
is the action you're looking for?

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.611
You want to see her
cunt, maybe? - Excuse me.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:20.681
Is that what you want
to see? - No, you're talking crazy.

01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:24.718
Why are my suggestions
any different than any of yours?

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.254
Most of your studie are
of naked women. Get out!

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:40.200
How is she?
- I got all of it out.

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:42.236
It'll depend on the scarring.

01:20:42.238 --> 01:20:44.371
It's unfortunate
circumstance, Eadweard,

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:47.241
but I'm very glad
to have met you.

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:51.245
What about deformities?

01:20:51.247 --> 01:20:54.615
Have you photographed that?

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:56.650
Deformities?

01:20:56.652 --> 01:20:59.053
I work out of the asylum.

01:20:59.055 --> 01:21:00.654
Blockley hospital.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.273
Go.

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:14.388
Hold him still!
Hold him down!

01:23:20.461 --> 01:23:24.231
Can we photograph this?
- Relax, relax...

01:23:24.233 --> 01:23:25.766
Thump-thump, thump-thump,
thump-thump, thump-thump,

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:29.469
thump-thump,
thump-thump...

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:32.739
Wouldn't that be something
to witness? - To capture?

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.409
Find me such a subject.
- Are you suggesting...

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:38.946
Yes, I am. It must be.
- I got it. I got it, sir.

01:23:38.948 --> 01:23:40.614
Go.

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:43.217
Very good...

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:46.587
Yes, very good.

01:24:01.402 --> 01:24:04.871
Sir, I found the
subject. - Which?

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:08.675
Thump-thump, thump-thump.
- Good. Good, good, good.

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.411
Yes.

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:44.278
Tadd, why do
you look so glum?

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.314
We're about to see
its ticker beat. Go on.

01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:59.293
There it is.

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.562
I feel it.

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:18.779
Inside each and every animal

01:25:18.781 --> 01:25:21.615
is a consistent
and steady action

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:24.351
<i>that connects us all.</i>

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:29.323
<i>A motion beneath
the skin, and the bones,</i>

01:25:29.325 --> 01:25:30.791
<i>the blood...</i>

01:25:32.061 --> 01:25:35.729
encased in darkness,

01:25:35.731 --> 01:25:38.532
hidden inside each
and every one of us...

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.071
<i>most never to be seen.</i>

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:50.811
<i>The very first motion of life.</i>

01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:37.891
My boy...

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:47.100
My little Floredo.

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:19.226
Am I dreaming? It's
something I've been working on.

01:28:19.228 --> 01:28:22.229
I call it a Zoopraxiscope.

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.170
It's wonderful.

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:33.573
It's a "life viewer."

01:28:33.575 --> 01:28:35.942
It's alive.

01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:39.746
I call it
"elephant walking."

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:41.281
He walks, and he walks,

01:28:41.283 --> 01:28:45.218
and never gets
tired. And then...

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:48.021
Stops.

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.091
And then he walks again.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:55.962
It's beautiful.
Isn't it?

01:28:55.964 --> 01:28:58.164
I've never seen
anything like this.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:01.701
No one has.
It's a trick of the eye.

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:04.738
Your mind strings
the pictures together

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.940
and creates life.

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:11.211
Is this how
you see the world?

01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:14.881
A series of little moments?

01:29:14.883 --> 01:29:18.585
Perhaps.
- It's beautiful, Eadweard.

01:29:18.587 --> 01:29:21.221
And I'm finished.

01:29:30.666 --> 01:29:34.034
It's the chemicals.
- No.

01:29:34.036 --> 01:29:36.169
Lemons.

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.819
What is that?

01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:55.021
What?

01:29:55.023 --> 01:29:59.826
That photograph of Floredo.

01:29:59.828 --> 01:30:03.029
It's a photograph
of the baby, Eadweard.

01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:05.098
Come here.

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:11.137
It's not one of my photos.

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:12.806
Who took it?

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.613
Eadweard, don't.

01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:34.961
"Little Harry."

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:44.371
Little Harry...

01:30:44.373 --> 01:30:49.142
You've lied to me.

01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:56.683
My baby...

01:30:56.685 --> 01:31:00.020
My boy is gone.

01:31:00.022 --> 01:31:03.123
No. No...

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:04.858
Where did this
come from? - Eadweard...

01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:06.960
Where did this come from?

01:31:07.995 --> 01:31:11.164
A letter.

01:31:13.235 --> 01:31:17.671
I would like to see this
letter from Harry Larkyns.

01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:42.162
Thank you.

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.153
I remember you
in the last game...

01:32:41.288 --> 01:32:42.388
Mr. Larkyns,

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:45.391
I have a message
for you from my wife.

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:18.858
Thump-thump,
thump-thump, thump-thump...

01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:39.145
I apologize
for ruining your evening.

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:51.678
<i>Yes, your honour,</i>

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.614
<i>we have reached
a unanimous verdict.</i>

01:35:54.616 --> 01:35:58.051
<i>We unanimously
reject the defense</i>

01:35:58.053 --> 01:36:01.287
<i>of "not guilty
by reason of insanity"</i>

01:36:01.289 --> 01:36:04.257
<i>as all evidence points
to a man that was clear-thinking,</i>

01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:06.626
<i>and acting in an obviously
premeditated fashion.</i>

01:36:08.228 --> 01:36:09.963
This was a man who,

01:36:09.965 --> 01:36:12.332
while in complete
control of his actions,

01:36:12.334 --> 01:36:16.536
made the choice
to execute Harry Larkyns.

01:36:16.538 --> 01:36:19.706
Harry Larkyns,

01:36:19.708 --> 01:36:23.476
the lying, cheating,
philandering seducer

01:36:23.478 --> 01:36:26.579
that stole the
heart of this man's wife,
and defiled their marriage

01:36:26.581 --> 01:36:28.114
and goddammit, your honour,

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:31.517
I would have shot
the son of a bitch myself.

01:36:31.519 --> 01:36:35.121
So, to the
charge of murder,

01:36:35.123 --> 01:36:36.689
we find the
defendant not guilty

01:36:36.691 --> 01:36:41.127
by reason of
doing the right thing.

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:17.824
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather 'round!

01:38:17.826 --> 01:38:20.827
The Kinetoscope.
For a nickel,

01:38:20.829 --> 01:38:23.362
see the world
dance in your eyes...

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:27.300
Flicker on your soul.

01:38:27.302 --> 01:38:29.802
For only a nickel,
you will have a chance

01:38:29.804 --> 01:38:33.773
to see the world's
first moving pictures.

01:38:33.775 --> 01:38:36.175
Step right up.
Right this way...
