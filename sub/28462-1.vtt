WEBVTT

02:03.992 --> 02:08.072
The Canadian Pacific Railroad,
Two steel lines that run

02:08.455 --> 02:10.827
one of the most territories
spectacular of the Earth.

02:11.583 --> 02:15.166
From the Atlantic to the Pacific, a powerful
way of communication and transport

02:15.504 --> 02:20.000
that links the two oceans.
The northern passage of our days.

02:21.343 --> 02:23.336
The construction of this modern
railway

02:23.679 --> 02:26.633
is synonymous with construction
of a nation, Canada.

02:27.558 --> 02:30.594
At the beginning of the 19th century, the future
of Canada as an independent nation

02:31.103 --> 02:32.431
It was uncertain.

02:32.729 --> 02:35.220
In the British Colony, isolated
by gigantic mountain ranges

02:36.066 --> 02:37.525
there was talk of secession.

02:37.943 --> 02:40.268
Only one railway line could
unite this distant western province

02:40.612 --> 02:41.988
with the rest of Canada.

02:42.322 --> 02:44.231
The explorers went
in the mountains,

02:44.575 --> 02:47.990
They climbed steep summits
and they crossed narrow gorges.

02:48.370 --> 02:50.612
The government spent millions of dollars
in the exploration.

02:51.164 --> 02:54.000
They discovered and built maps
of regions of indescribable beauty.

02:54.459 --> 02:56.701
But the great barrier
of the Rocky Mountains

02:57.045 --> 02:59.963
he jealously guarded
in its silent immensity

03:00.382 --> 03:02.375
the secret that would make it possible
this railroad.

03:02.801 --> 03:05.209
A path through which I could pass
the train.

03:05.721 --> 03:09.421
Then the crisis came. The
workers threw the tools.

03:12.853 --> 03:14.228
The work was paralyzed.

03:15.272 --> 03:17.810
The materials were abandoned
in the middle of the prairies

03:18.734 --> 03:21.059
and the advance of the tracks stopped.

03:22.696 --> 03:26.860
The government emergency committee
convened an emergency session.

03:27.576 --> 03:30.149
From the beginning the project
I was doomed to failure.

03:30.537 --> 03:34.701
The idea of â€‹â€‹building a railroad to
through those mountains was crazy.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.752
There is no practicable route,
has never existed

03:38.086 --> 03:40.494
and it is unnecessary to say
that there never will be.

03:43.008 --> 03:44.383
The representative of Ontario.

03:44.718 --> 03:47.387
The mountains are not everything,
there are also human obstacles.

03:47.846 --> 03:51.796
The settlers, the Indians, all threaten
with bursting this railroad balloon.

03:52.142 --> 03:55.143
Many people will die,
many homes will be ruined.

03:55.854 --> 03:58.096
The representative
of the British Colony.

04:00.359 --> 04:02.980
The British Colony begins
to lose patience.

04:03.278 --> 04:05.105
We have heard too many excuses.

04:05.489 --> 04:07.695
We are isolated on the other side
from those mountains

04:08.075 --> 04:09.403
about which we discuss so much.

04:09.701 --> 04:12.027
I warn you, gentlemen, that,
if that railroad is not built,

04:12.287 --> 04:15.158
the British Colony will become
in an independent domain.

04:15.457 --> 04:17.035
We will separate!

04:20.504 --> 04:22.793
I think our guest will be able to
clarify the situation

04:23.674 --> 04:26.378
if you are given the opportunity
to talk

04:27.135 --> 04:29.211
I'm sure that when
have heard

04:30.013 --> 04:32.421
they will have a different vision
of the project.

04:33.475 --> 04:36.346
let me introduce
to Mr. William Van Horne,

04:36.645 --> 04:39.017
general director of
Canadian Pacific Railway.

04:47.072 --> 04:50.275
There are things that some men
they can do and others can not.

04:50.826 --> 04:55.037
Your job is to run a country,
Mine is to build railroads.

04:55.455 --> 04:58.789
But since we all have an interest
special in the Canadian Pacific,

04:59.251 --> 05:01.872
it would be better if we all go up
to the same train.

05:02.379 --> 05:06.163
I know that there are many obstacles.
Human and geographical obstacles.

05:07.259 --> 05:09.714
We hope to overcome them
when they arise.

05:10.596 --> 05:15.222
I do not know how to do miracles, I'm just
a simple railroad builder

05:15.517 --> 05:18.637
that can be wrong
like any man.

05:19.730 --> 05:24.557
But in this case, I assure
that this railroad is going to be built.

05:25.027 --> 05:28.526
Mr. Van Horne,
Can I ask you a direct question?

05:29.072 --> 05:31.777
Is it possible to cross those mountains?

05:32.326 --> 05:35.742
If Hannibal crossed the Alps,
we will cross the Rockies.

05:36.330 --> 05:39.829
To your question will give fulfilled
and soon a man,

05:40.959 --> 05:45.752
He is the explorer, gentlemen.
A famous man on the border.

05:46.256 --> 05:50.206
At this precise moment he is plotting
a way to cross the Rockies.

05:50.677 --> 05:55.173
I promise you that this man
You will find a step.

08:56.697 --> 08:57.479
Do not!

08:59.032 --> 09:00.361
I just want you to feel harassed.

10:29.331 --> 10:30.244
Is Dirk Rourke here?

10:30.749 --> 10:31.579
Do not.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.411
Do you know if it will come?

10:34.002 --> 10:38.214
- No. Is it about furs?
- Yes. Fur.

10:50.978 --> 10:52.306
What's up, Tom?

10:58.277 --> 11:00.150
This is already working.

11:01.989 --> 11:03.187
Where have you been, Tom?

11:04.866 --> 11:06.610
So you're back, huh?

11:10.872 --> 11:11.702
Hey, Tom!

11:12.291 --> 11:16.834
- Mike. How are you?
- All right. Are you still with the same crew?

11:17.170 --> 11:19.792
Yes, less any
I did not want to wake up.

11:20.382 --> 11:22.090
We were waiting for you to arrive.

11:22.467 --> 11:24.923
What are we going to do?
Are we going ahead or is it over here?

11:25.178 --> 11:27.171
That depends on Van Horne,
Are you in the camp?

11:27.514 --> 11:31.049
Yes. He's in his car right now,
and wanting to talk to you.

11:31.393 --> 11:34.228
Tom! Hey, Tom!

11:34.980 --> 11:36.640
- See you later, Mike.
- See you later.

11:41.069 --> 11:43.691
Tom, how are you, old fox?

11:44.031 --> 11:45.857
Dynamite Dawson,
I'm glad to see you.

11:46.199 --> 11:48.358
I knew that they could not build
a railroad without you

11:48.994 --> 11:51.865
I thought you had a naughty hung
of the neck the last time we saw each other.

11:52.289 --> 11:54.697
They did it, but when we arrived
with the rails to civilization

11:55.042 --> 11:58.909
it started to get boring, so I
I shook it off and came to Canada.

11:59.630 --> 12:02.417
Oh, Tom, how are we doing?
to go on this line, huh?

12:02.841 --> 12:05.510
No, I'm going to shake this
rail above right now.

12:06.386 --> 12:07.715
Do you retire before you start?

12:09.139 --> 12:12.555
What can you have in your head that is
more important than a railroad?

12:12.935 --> 12:16.600
- You do not even imagine it.
- But you can not do this to me, Tom!

12:17.022 --> 12:19.595
Think about the fights
that you're going to lose

12:21.318 --> 12:23.026
You are softening.

12:34.748 --> 12:35.946
Mike,
Where did this bird come from?

12:36.333 --> 12:37.792
I hired him this morning,
Why, what has he done?

12:38.126 --> 12:39.537
What can he do?
Get him out of the camp.

12:39.836 --> 12:42.506
Long, go see the cashier
and to pay you.

12:43.131 --> 12:44.709
Let me in, please.

12:45.008 --> 12:47.334
You've heard, Brannigan,
Get up and go, hurry!

12:47.844 --> 12:49.504
Wait, this man
it's hurt.

12:49.846 --> 12:53.381
And if it is not, it will be.
Out, and say hello to Dirk Rourke.

12:53.725 --> 12:54.888
I am a doctor!

12:55.269 --> 12:57.060
- Doctor?
- Yes it's correct.

13:00.065 --> 13:01.607
What kind of man are you?

13:01.984 --> 13:05.269
I have seen everything. He has attacked him
without giving him an opportunity to defend himself.

13:05.654 --> 13:06.603
That's it.

13:06.905 --> 13:10.239
I do not know what disagreements they have, but
Sure they can be solved without violence.

13:10.617 --> 13:13.404
As you will see, Mr. Brannigan, hiring
quarrelsome workers like this man

13:13.745 --> 13:18.288
will create problems in the camp
and will slow down the pace of work.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.618
Just a moment,
Does he not know who he is?

13:20.919 --> 13:22.117
I can not help it, doctor.

13:22.462 --> 13:25.333
I was born with violence inside. Every time
I see a rat with a red shirt,

13:25.716 --> 13:27.044
I go crazy.

13:31.013 --> 13:34.049
Tom, what happened? Why
Did you crush that nose?

13:34.349 --> 13:36.971
- And who is Dirk Rourke?
- It's a personal matter.

13:37.311 --> 13:40.265
- Dynamite, when did that doctor come?
- He came with the hospital car.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.643
And if I tell you the truth, I do not trust
of the bushes without sideburns.

13:43.984 --> 13:45.264
It depends on how bad you are.

13:45.527 --> 13:47.983
You will see how there will be many sick people
in this camp shortly.

13:48.530 --> 13:51.697
It's a pity that you do not stay
to head the parade.

13:58.916 --> 14:01.786
From Parliament, Mr. Van Horne,
they want to know your opinion ...

14:02.127 --> 14:04.665
Yes, I've heard it.
We will give you long ones.

14:05.672 --> 14:06.870
Send this

14:07.257 --> 14:11.836
The exploration continues advancing.
It's all under control.

14:18.644 --> 14:19.592
Hello!

14:20.187 --> 14:21.598
- He's back.
- I'm back.

14:21.939 --> 14:24.264
- It has been delayed three days.
- You're lucky he came.

14:24.608 --> 14:25.521
I'm lucky?

14:25.817 --> 14:29.233
Parliament again. They order me to
Send a man on horseback to look for him.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.189
Are you hiding, Mr. Van Horne?

14:32.449 --> 14:35.118
Hey, Ibex with hat,
I've been lying three days

14:35.369 --> 14:38.120
to cover it up to you, lying to you
to the president, to the Parliament,

14:38.413 --> 14:40.655
to Ottawa, even myself.

14:40.916 --> 14:45.079
And you appear here waddling
and says "Hello." Very pretty.

14:45.379 --> 14:47.502
Can I invite you to a cup of tea?

14:47.798 --> 14:49.755
It's true, I've been delayed a bit,
but...

14:50.008 --> 14:53.128
I was not exactly sitting
in a luxurious private car.

14:54.304 --> 14:57.009
Leave us
That tells me?

14:58.058 --> 14:59.303
What route will we follow?

14:59.560 --> 15:02.181
This exploration has supposed
a great personal risk.

15:02.479 --> 15:05.017
- I guess you'll pay me what you agreed.
- The route, Tom, the route.

15:05.315 --> 15:07.723
It is a very difficult terrain,
full of all kinds of obstacles.

15:08.026 --> 15:10.482
Speak clearly once.
Do not tell me you have not found a step.

15:10.737 --> 15:12.362
Yes, I have found a step.

15:12.739 --> 15:17.117
They will have to make bridges and tunnels,
and more than once circling 90 degrees.

15:17.578 --> 15:23.034
But that is your way to the Pacific
and you can do it.

15:24.209 --> 15:27.412
Do not give me coba, it's not necessary.

15:27.838 --> 15:30.459
I will draw the maps and detail
the route before leaving.

15:32.509 --> 15:36.803
Tell them we found the route,
that my personal explorer, Tom Andrews

15:37.264 --> 15:42.258
has found a step and that
all the routes previously proposed

15:42.644 --> 15:43.807
They are impractical.

15:44.104 --> 15:46.429
- They are what?
- lmpr ... Make impossible.

15:50.027 --> 15:52.434
Tom, what did he say about leaving?

15:52.821 --> 15:54.648
You have the step,
my work is over.

15:55.073 --> 15:57.564
Oh, no, it can not.
He has to stay until the end.

15:58.243 --> 15:59.524
Maybe on another occasion.

15:59.953 --> 16:02.409
That of personal explorer
It has touched me.

16:02.873 --> 16:04.782
But for the moment
enough rail

16:05.209 --> 16:08.293
I have another project west of
Calgary I committed myself last year.

16:08.587 --> 16:12.537
- You are even more a liar than me.
- I'm not lying. I have another commitment.

16:13.175 --> 16:16.674
What's more, I'm tired of leaving
the knuckles in other people's fights.

16:17.012 --> 16:18.554
From now on I will be a man of peace.

16:18.889 --> 16:21.427
If he keeps talking like that
I will think he is a saint.

16:22.559 --> 16:23.888
Good morning, Mr. Van Horne.

16:26.063 --> 16:29.432
We have made the list of medicines
what do we need. I would like you to see it.

16:29.733 --> 16:31.642
We'll examine it later, doctor.

16:31.985 --> 16:33.942
I would like to introduce you
Mr. Tom Andrews.

16:34.321 --> 16:38.449
Dr. Mason and Dr. Edith Cabot,
They are our medical team.

16:38.742 --> 16:41.743
Oh, Tom Andrews!
It's as if I already knew him.

16:42.037 --> 16:43.911
Mr. Van Horne has boasted
so much of you ...

16:44.206 --> 16:47.290
Enchanted, doctor.
Dr. Cabot.

16:48.085 --> 16:50.042
So you are
the famous explorer.

16:50.379 --> 16:54.079
I'm something else, I'm the famous
personal explorer of Mr. Van Horne.

16:54.424 --> 16:57.129
That must be funny,
but I am denied for jokes.

16:57.469 --> 17:00.387
It's not funny, Edith, many believe
which is the best explorer

17:00.722 --> 17:03.048
and knows how to solve problems
in this business.

17:03.350 --> 17:05.887
But you can not say
make it funny

17:06.185 --> 17:07.348
Solve problems?

17:07.646 --> 17:09.722
He's quick with his fists
and with a weapon.

17:10.022 --> 17:13.023
Many saboteurs and rowdies
they go to the camps.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.233
It takes a man
that is responsible for expelling them.

17:15.570 --> 17:18.061
That's right, doctor, I spoil them
and you fix them.

17:18.406 --> 17:20.944
You're right, Mr. Van Horne,
it's not funny.

17:21.577 --> 17:23.983
I have verified that
your work perfectly.

17:24.371 --> 17:27.076
But I can not be in favor
of violence as a solution.

17:27.457 --> 17:29.165
You will have seen a lot of violence.

17:29.501 --> 17:31.494
I could experience it at the border
with my father,

17:31.753 --> 17:35.253
Dr. Mason was his partner.
They killed my father, Mr. Andrews,

17:35.549 --> 17:38.799
for trying to use a weapon against
a man instead of reasoning with him.

17:39.303 --> 17:42.220
I would still be alive
If he had not brought arms.

17:42.598 --> 17:44.175
I'm sorry about your father,

17:44.474 --> 17:47.641
but I have learned that in this country
if you draw fast you live more.

17:47.936 --> 17:52.349
Force never solves anything, only
It brings more resentments and more violence.

17:52.691 --> 17:54.980
What do you suggest then,
Dear?

17:55.694 --> 17:58.730
- I would not hire gunmen.
- Thank you, Miss.

17:59.072 --> 18:00.982
His words give me the reason
in the talk he kept

18:01.283 --> 18:04.734
with Mr. Van Horne, there's no place
here for a man like me.

18:05.037 --> 18:08.737
- I'm very grateful.
- You're welcome, we'll be back later.

18:14.546 --> 18:18.674
I should not talk to you like that, it's a
good doctor and a great woman.

18:19.009 --> 18:21.417
She is beautiful and crazy.
It says a lot of nonsense.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.428
Then why does it leave?

18:23.764 --> 18:26.385
I have already done a job and well,
Now I'm going on vacation.

18:26.808 --> 18:29.346
Oh, vacation!
I thought it was a new project.

18:29.645 --> 18:32.562
Mr. Tom Andrews
hunted by a woman.

18:32.814 --> 18:35.732
Of course, a more human one,
not so angelic.

18:36.068 --> 18:39.484
Good luck with construction, and when
Stop by Calgary, touch the whistle.

19:27.661 --> 19:28.491
Tom!

19:29.162 --> 19:31.867
- Mom, it's here!
- What?

19:45.095 --> 19:47.218
- Tom!
- Cecille!

19:55.105 --> 19:56.480
Oh, Tom!

20:02.237 --> 20:04.029
I sensed that you were going to arrive today.

20:04.781 --> 20:07.533
Hey, my little savage ...

20:11.079 --> 20:13.831
I have dreamed and prayed
and you're here

20:32.684 --> 20:34.262
Mom, look what I found.

20:37.064 --> 20:40.433
- Welcome, Mr. Andrews!
- How are you, Mama Gautier?

20:43.070 --> 20:46.569
She's prettier than ever, more
that all I've seen out there.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.698
Mom, you're blushing.

20:49.201 --> 20:50.660
I will prepare dinner.

20:51.578 --> 20:53.452
I will give him
one brushed the horse.

20:54.623 --> 20:56.616
What girls have you seen out there?

20:57.042 --> 21:01.669
Many, in British Columbia
I met a very attractive squaw.

21:02.005 --> 21:04.710
- One meter high by one wide.
- You're kidding. I should ...

21:05.801 --> 21:07.628
Oh, Tom!

21:09.888 --> 21:12.379
So you say now, but someday
you will miss the railway

21:12.808 --> 21:14.551
- and you will go back.
- Oh no!

21:15.102 --> 21:17.640
Even the mounted police would not take me
back there

21:17.938 --> 21:21.307
You can do exploration work
without having to risk life.

21:21.567 --> 21:23.144
I'm so happy
that would make me cry

21:23.485 --> 21:26.190
Dad said I was going to be cross-eyed
from both looking at the road

21:26.488 --> 21:29.323
- why you were going to return.
- Where's your father?

21:29.575 --> 21:30.985
He had to go to a meeting.

21:31.326 --> 21:33.153
Have you seen our lake?
The one you told me about.

21:33.495 --> 21:35.820
And it's more beautiful
than the first time I saw it.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.038
Now they call it Lake Louis.

21:39.376 --> 21:43.789
But it's too wild
for a honeymoon. Bears, lynxes ...

21:45.173 --> 21:47.961
By your side I am not afraid
nothing in the world.

21:48.510 --> 21:51.345
Do you know something, Cecille?
Me, yours, either.

21:56.184 --> 21:59.388
- When I gave you this ...
- The night you asked me.

22:00.105 --> 22:04.684
Tom, there will be nothing more wonderful
than being married to you

22:09.615 --> 22:12.865
You will have to change, you will make me food,
You will serve me as a squaw ...

22:13.368 --> 22:15.740
Of that nothing.
That would have wanted Dirk Rourke.

22:16.538 --> 22:19.325
When we are Married
will stop bothering me

22:19.750 --> 22:21.410
- Dirk Rourke?
- Yes

22:21.752 --> 22:24.243
It has a supply warehouse,
or so it says.

22:24.630 --> 22:29.208
But it's the excuse he uses to come
to see ... dad, as he says.

22:29.551 --> 22:30.962
Did it bother you again?

22:31.261 --> 22:33.799
I told him that very clearly that time
and it was quite

22:34.640 --> 22:38.305
You should have seen his face when
I told him I was going to marry you.

22:38.685 --> 22:41.057
I would have killed you
If I had seen you then.

22:42.356 --> 22:45.938
He has already wanted to do it. He was
shooting at me there, in the canyon.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.558
Do not...

22:48.403 --> 22:50.361
And you are the reason.

22:50.697 --> 22:52.939
If dad knew, there would not be
I went to that meeting with Dirk.

22:54.243 --> 22:55.701
Dirk has called that meeting?

22:56.119 --> 22:57.993
they were going to talk about something
of the railroad

22:58.330 --> 23:01.201
- Where are they?
- In the barn of your warehouse.

23:03.669 --> 23:07.334
Tom, Dirk has not bothered me again
since that first time.

23:07.631 --> 23:09.173
But it has bothered me.

23:12.594 --> 23:15.631
Do not intervene, do not go,
all your men will be there.

23:15.889 --> 23:16.920
Better.

23:27.818 --> 23:30.854
Please, stay, you have been
so long away ...

23:32.823 --> 23:36.441
There will be shots. Dirk has
little patience and you too.

23:36.827 --> 23:38.025
I do not want to lose you, Tom.

23:42.666 --> 23:47.162
Maybe it's better to go unarmed.
I want to talk to those men.

23:47.921 --> 23:50.210
Tell them that I have come
to stay.

23:57.431 --> 23:59.673
Tom! Tom!

24:00.309 --> 24:01.803
- What's wrong, Cecille?
- He's going to the meeting.

24:02.102 --> 24:03.727
He will be safer without this.

24:11.028 --> 24:14.942
They will lynch him, Dirk is capable of everything.
It will kill him!

24:23.624 --> 24:26.743
The railroad will bring the end of our
freedom and our country.

24:28.128 --> 24:29.587
This earth is our
and we will defend it.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.964
- Maybe they can not finish it.
- They say they stopped work.

24:33.342 --> 24:35.630
The work goes on
and I can prove it.

24:36.094 --> 24:38.336
Do you remember Tom Andrews?
He was here last year.

24:39.014 --> 24:41.931
- You know him, Gautier.
- Sure, he's going to marry my daughter.

24:42.267 --> 24:45.268
He has cheated you too,
as everyone.

24:45.729 --> 24:48.434
You will be convinced when you hear
what I'm going to tell you

24:48.982 --> 24:52.232
There is a step through which
You can cross the railroad.

24:52.778 --> 24:55.483
I know him, but I did not say
nothing for the good of all.

24:55.906 --> 24:59.156
But Tom Andrews has found it.
I saw him there last week.

25:00.077 --> 25:01.950
Work as an explorer
for the railroad!

25:02.287 --> 25:05.407
- He has not told me anything about that.
- We're going to have to chastise him.

25:07.334 --> 25:09.327
Why do not you tell them everything,
Rourke?

25:11.088 --> 25:13.875
That you followed me and tried
put a bullet in my back.

25:14.550 --> 25:16.542
But we'll fix that
after alone.

25:17.636 --> 25:21.087
I want to make my position clear.
I plan to stay here,

25:21.890 --> 25:25.840
get married I like this land
and its people, I want to be one of you.

25:26.228 --> 25:31.104
But if you believe the garbage that Rourke
is telling you, maybe I change my mind.

25:31.441 --> 25:34.478
I do not want to have to pick up a revolver
every time he leaves my house.

25:34.778 --> 25:37.447
Are you going to deny that you have found
That step for the railroad?

25:37.739 --> 25:40.230
No, but if it had not been me,
I would have found another.

25:40.867 --> 25:43.275
The railroad will get here,
nobody can stop it.

25:43.579 --> 25:45.452
And of course, things will change.

25:45.872 --> 25:48.280
But Rourke is wrong when he says
that will harm us.

25:48.667 --> 25:51.787
The railroad will bring many advantages
that you do not know until now

25:53.297 --> 25:55.538
The first is that you will leave
to live isolated

25:55.841 --> 25:57.999
- You will be part of the world.
- Everything is a lie!

25:58.302 --> 25:59.926
They have sent him the railroad
to deceive you.

26:00.345 --> 26:02.967
I do not work for them anymore.
And if I'm going to stay here,

26:03.265 --> 26:05.304
I have so much interest in what
the railway may mean

26:05.601 --> 26:06.763
like any of you.

26:07.060 --> 26:08.934
I say you have to stop
the railway!

26:10.939 --> 26:14.106
Friends, please, for your
families, for your homes,

26:14.401 --> 26:16.192
do not start something
that you will be unable to finish.

26:16.486 --> 26:18.894
We will finish it! Do you want to lose
everything you have?

26:19.281 --> 26:20.479
My only interest is you!

26:20.782 --> 26:23.155
Your only interest are your stores
of supplies.

26:23.577 --> 26:25.451
Because the benefits that you are
getting from these people

26:25.787 --> 26:27.068
They will disappear.

26:27.456 --> 26:29.662
The trappers will not have
that sell you their skins,

26:29.958 --> 26:33.541
they can send them directly, and the same
It will happen with the farmers and the settlers.

26:33.921 --> 26:36.079
You are the only one who will harm
the railway.

26:36.381 --> 26:38.421
The railroad will bring
an avalanche of people!

26:38.759 --> 26:42.459
Hundreds of men who will hunt
the animals that belong to you!

26:43.347 --> 26:45.635
They will take you
your crops!

26:46.141 --> 26:48.466
That is the man you will have
thanking your children

26:48.769 --> 26:50.393
die of hunger

26:50.687 --> 26:53.522
I've been swearing, Rourke, that
someday I would adjust the accounts!

27:39.278 --> 27:41.484
Are you going to marry Cecille with an employee
of the railroad

27:41.822 --> 27:43.364
He will not marry my daughter!

28:00.299 --> 28:02.125
Stop! Stop!

28:04.052 --> 28:06.590
- Stop fighting.
- Right now, father.

28:08.849 --> 28:10.094
Tom, you should be ashamed.

28:11.435 --> 28:13.392
I would be ashamed if it was him.

28:14.730 --> 28:16.603
- The railroad again.
- Yes father.

28:17.441 --> 28:20.442
You are wrong if you go
to these meetings.

28:20.861 --> 28:22.937
They can only bring you problems.

28:23.530 --> 28:26.650
I beg you to go to yours
houses and meditate on this calmly.

28:26.950 --> 28:29.488
- Yes father.
- Tom, I want to talk to you.

28:30.037 --> 28:31.661
- Cure Rourke.
- Yes father.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.340
Rourke will never forgive you this.

28:44.134 --> 28:45.878
The end of a long friendship.

28:47.471 --> 28:49.926
This is the first opportunity
I have had to welcome you.

28:51.225 --> 28:56.385
Cecille was waiting for you one of these days.
He says you've left the railroad.

28:57.147 --> 28:59.187
It is not a place to take
to a wife

29:00.692 --> 29:02.981
Do you know I'm going to the camp
of the railroad tomorrow?

29:03.862 --> 29:05.143
No. To what?

29:05.405 --> 29:07.065
Mr. Van Horne has called me.

29:07.366 --> 29:09.691
Think that my presence
It would be good for men.

29:10.410 --> 29:12.486
And where did he get that idea?

29:12.871 --> 29:15.409
You've seen what Dirk Rourke
is causing.

29:16.041 --> 29:20.335
The people are nervous,
and this could end badly.

29:22.339 --> 29:23.418
Yes.

29:25.050 --> 29:30.839
I trust that among all we arrange it
peacefully before it's too late.

29:33.725 --> 29:36.051
- Good, goodnight.
- Good evening, father.

29:38.939 --> 29:39.970
Oh, Tom!

29:42.234 --> 29:45.769
Please give this to Cecille.
He left it at my house.

29:46.113 --> 29:47.358
Clear!

30:06.258 --> 30:08.001
- I was waiting for you.
- Yes?

30:08.635 --> 30:10.675
- What happened at the meeting?
- Everything went well.

30:11.638 --> 30:15.090
- Why? You were afraid?
- Of course not.

30:17.519 --> 30:20.010
I felt very lonely out here
waiting for you.

30:20.731 --> 30:24.775
It's cold, but I did not want to go
until you came back

30:25.736 --> 30:28.523
By the way, you forgot the shawl
at Father Lacomb's house.

30:30.866 --> 30:34.614
It does not matter, you're back.
We'll be together...

30:35.537 --> 30:36.818
We will go to our lake.

30:37.247 --> 30:40.165
Cecille, listen,
Things have changed.

30:41.710 --> 30:43.335
Our lake will have to wait.

30:45.505 --> 30:47.498
I will go to the camp
of the railroad tomorrow.

30:47.883 --> 30:51.086
- No, Tom! When you arrived, you told me ...
- Yes, but I have not finished my work.

30:51.553 --> 30:53.427
If there are complications,
I must be there.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.507
- That war is not yours.
- Yes it is.

30:57.184 --> 31:00.434
Trains ... Nobody talks anymore
of another thing.

31:00.812 --> 31:03.766
Is there no other important issue
to talk about in the world?

31:04.149 --> 31:06.901
- Yes ... There you are.
- I'm!

31:07.444 --> 31:09.318
And you are going to leave me to go back
to the camp!

31:09.613 --> 31:11.652
It will only be a year longer at the most,
try to understand it

31:12.241 --> 31:13.154
I understand!

31:13.450 --> 31:16.321
I've waited a year, now you ask me
wait for another, and then another.

31:16.745 --> 31:20.825
I have to agree with Dirk,
the railway only brings misfortunes.

31:22.042 --> 31:24.450
It is the only thing that has brought me.

31:25.712 --> 31:30.374
My countrymen do not want it, nor do I ...
And I do not love you either!

32:01.707 --> 32:05.704
To have left this business,
It seems he still has an interest in him.

32:06.169 --> 32:09.538
Why can not you get
nothing without your personal explorer?

32:10.340 --> 32:11.455
There is Mike.

32:15.262 --> 32:16.507
Stand aside.

32:25.314 --> 32:28.599
All right. We have done many
progress.

32:28.984 --> 32:32.104
There are no fights in the camps,
not even a broken little finger.

32:32.613 --> 32:34.570
At this rate, we will reach the step
before winter

32:34.865 --> 32:37.190
Let's wait Anyway,
I will be alert.

32:37.784 --> 32:39.777
It will never change, Tom!

32:40.287 --> 32:42.445
I leave.
I'm going to inspect the new section.

33:16.615 --> 33:20.114
What do you mean, fly the wagon?
Horses are valuable.

33:20.452 --> 33:23.157
Tom, how I was glad when
You showed up this morning.

33:23.455 --> 33:26.622
- Even the horses were happy.
- Thanks, but be careful with that.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.369
Men are not used
to that material like you.

33:28.752 --> 33:30.709
I've been trying to see you alone
all day.

33:31.088 --> 33:33.164
This is the best way
to get it.

33:33.966 --> 33:35.246
What do you want to say to me?

33:35.676 --> 33:38.677
They are stealing dynamite.
Last night half a box.

33:39.012 --> 33:40.922
- Last night, a whole box.
- Did you see someone?

33:41.306 --> 33:43.465
Footprints around
of all the powder magazine.

33:43.809 --> 33:49.349
Indian moccasins. But Tom, the Indians
They do not know what dynamite is for.

33:49.648 --> 33:51.937
- Who else knows this?
- Only you and me so far.

33:52.276 --> 33:54.564
Do not talk to anyone
I will find out what happens.

33:57.698 --> 33:59.108
See you later.

34:09.918 --> 34:12.125
Two of your men
They do not seem Indian at all.

34:12.462 --> 34:13.625
They look white.

34:14.422 --> 34:19.001
White man has sharp eyes.
It would be better for you to have them closed.

34:20.012 --> 34:22.585
Those two stay. Take yourself
your men to your camp.

34:34.735 --> 34:38.020
- Again you, I should have imagined it.
- Yes, doctor.

34:38.447 --> 34:41.612
Until now, until you
He has returned, there has been tranquility.

34:42.074 --> 34:45.279
With you they return the weapons,
the fists, the violence.

34:45.579 --> 34:47.951
Doctor, has not it happened to you?
the head that I can have a reason

34:48.331 --> 34:50.408
- to shoot against these men?
- What reason?

35:06.725 --> 35:07.923
Calmly, guys.

35:08.977 --> 35:09.891
Father!

35:15.150 --> 35:17.273
Take him to the hospital car
as soon as we can move it.

35:22.449 --> 35:23.480
What are you looking for?

35:27.871 --> 35:28.701
Doctor!

35:33.001 --> 35:33.997
There he is right.

35:44.471 --> 35:46.179
You two, come with me.

35:59.987 --> 36:02.941
Get up!
And you too!

36:04.741 --> 36:06.817
Take them to Calgary,
accuse them of murder.

36:11.039 --> 36:12.202
Doctor!

36:40.235 --> 36:43.236
I...
14, 15, 16 ...

36:43.572 --> 36:45.066
You have looked for a good shack.

36:45.490 --> 36:48.990
When we get to the mountains,
I'm going to need another one.

36:49.411 --> 36:52.697
You will continue playing at another time.
How many cartridges are you missing?

36:53.040 --> 36:55.079
Almost a thousand cartridges.

36:55.417 --> 36:58.537
108 cartridges per box, make
almost ten boxes.

36:58.879 --> 37:01.631
And with that you can go to hell
to the whole camp.

37:03.258 --> 37:06.176
- Tell me about your assistants.
- I've thrown them two.

37:06.803 --> 37:08.630
But not like you do now.

37:10.515 --> 37:12.425
Tom, you disappointed me.

37:13.143 --> 37:16.512
When I was a sheriff in the territories
of the Delaware River ...

37:16.855 --> 37:18.812
The last time you told me,
You were judge.

37:19.441 --> 37:22.110
I shot one man,
and that was it.

37:22.444 --> 37:24.900
You to those two
you only cut their wings.

37:25.197 --> 37:26.656
I'm trying new tactics.

37:27.032 --> 37:31.160
I see, you want to look good
with the quack.

37:32.788 --> 37:35.539
In short, in other times you were good.

37:35.916 --> 37:37.790
But when a man like you
begins to soften,

37:38.168 --> 37:40.837
- It ends up like gelatin.
- It's just that I'm getting old.

37:41.129 --> 37:43.620
- Hey, I'm going to need your car.
- For what?

37:43.882 --> 37:45.542
It is another new tactic.

37:46.385 --> 37:49.635
Tonight bind my horse with others,
where everyone can see it.

37:50.305 --> 37:53.342
Take your blankets to my store,
turn on the lamp and start reading.

37:53.642 --> 37:57.058
- If you know.
- Read? I studied at Harvard.

37:57.396 --> 37:58.641
I thought it was Yale.

37:59.106 --> 38:00.849
Well, in college.

38:01.191 --> 38:04.607
Well, start reading. Have to
It seems that I am in my store.

38:05.320 --> 38:08.191
Why can not I accompany you?
For whatever it is.

38:08.657 --> 38:11.824
It has to be done by only one man.
It's my thing. lndians

38:12.202 --> 38:15.322
lndios ... Well, I once
I lived with a squaw that ...

38:16.164 --> 38:18.786
Hey, do not go messing with one.

38:22.671 --> 38:27.132
Let's see, where did he go?
Oops, I lost the account.

39:36.912 --> 39:39.367
- Do you know what dynamite is?
- Yes

39:41.375 --> 39:46.879
Missing railroad dynamite,
stolen. It's dangerous.

39:47.965 --> 39:50.538
You friend of Father Lacomb,
to see you on an iron road with him.

39:50.926 --> 39:51.875
It is true.

39:52.261 --> 39:55.215
I have not come to accuse you, boss,
You understand?

39:56.223 --> 40:00.849
But white men pay some
of your young people to steal dynamite.

40:02.646 --> 40:04.935
Those white men
They are not your friends.

40:06.066 --> 40:07.608
They have not told you the truth.

40:07.901 --> 40:08.932
Come with me.

41:19.556 --> 41:20.587
I feel.

41:21.725 --> 41:25.426
- This will not happen again.
- Thanks boss.

42:06.603 --> 42:07.469
Boys!

42:16.905 --> 42:18.649
Unleash the horses
and feed them.

42:21.618 --> 42:22.614
No wait.

42:23.579 --> 42:25.037
It's like shooting the target.

42:25.581 --> 42:28.747
It has occurred to me ... something better.

42:46.560 --> 42:49.644
One of the boxes on the floor, huh?
Aim well.

43:15.130 --> 43:17.206
Leave me,
move away from the middle!

43:17.674 --> 43:19.667
Bring a stretcher, fast!

43:54.836 --> 43:56.035
Doctor!

43:56.713 --> 43:57.911
Has died?

43:58.257 --> 44:00.795
No, but I do not understand
how he is still alive

44:02.469 --> 44:06.467
Yes, they are things of dynamite.
I was too close.

44:07.057 --> 44:09.975
If it had been a couple of meters,
I would have blown to pieces.

44:10.394 --> 44:11.508
I did not know, I did not know it!

44:15.148 --> 44:16.773
We have to wait until
get to the hospital.

44:17.359 --> 44:18.984
We should not give him a transfusion
now.

44:19.319 --> 44:22.320
You need blood, if not,
he will not arrive alive to the operating room.

44:22.990 --> 44:24.899
I warn you, you can die.

44:25.242 --> 44:27.281
If he could choose,
I would risk it.

45:06.241 --> 45:07.901
Now it's up to you, friend.

45:41.735 --> 45:43.395
Stay put for a while.

45:52.412 --> 45:55.200
Will you live now, miss?
Sorry, doctor.

45:55.999 --> 45:57.375
Do you know how to pray?

46:28.782 --> 46:29.612
What do you say?

46:30.450 --> 46:32.692
The settlers of my valley
they are with us Almost every.

46:33.036 --> 46:34.116
The same is true of mine.

46:34.621 --> 46:36.910
All will be ready
when necessary.

46:37.249 --> 46:40.452
Good job. The railway
It is lost forever.

46:41.962 --> 46:44.500
How dare you to meet
in this house?

46:44.882 --> 46:46.708
There will be many more meetings
in this house.

46:47.092 --> 46:49.381
It's my will, and it's my house.

46:49.678 --> 46:51.089
You too
have you put yourself on their side?

46:51.388 --> 46:53.713
Your father is now
one of my assistants.

46:53.974 --> 46:55.349
Cecille, sit down,
I'll tell you everything

46:55.642 --> 46:57.801
- Thanks, I'd rather stay on my feet.
- As you like.

46:58.395 --> 47:00.222
We are organizing
for the action.

47:00.898 --> 47:03.305
When winter comes
they will have to stop work,

47:03.609 --> 47:04.474
That will give us time.

47:04.818 --> 47:05.981
I have been to the camp.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.727
They will not reach the step
before the snows arrive.

47:09.031 --> 47:12.115
They have had some accidents
that have delayed them enough.

47:12.618 --> 47:15.109
That's. A couple of cartridges are missing
of dynamite to fly a gorge

47:15.537 --> 47:17.411
and make them lose many days.

47:17.706 --> 47:21.241
When you come back, tell the rest of
our friends who remember it well.

47:21.543 --> 47:23.335
And I have new ideas for
when spring comes

47:23.670 --> 47:26.457
that will make things very difficult for you.
They will not be able to do a kilometer a day.

47:26.882 --> 47:28.459
Give me the carafe.

47:29.092 --> 47:31.168
Let's drink by the fall
from Van Horne!

47:31.762 --> 47:34.882
Next week
I'll go talk to the Indians. Yes.

47:35.307 --> 47:37.264
Before winter comes
we will have all the tribes

47:37.601 --> 47:39.594
from here to Vancouver
up in arms.

47:39.978 --> 47:41.971
The accidents delay the works,

47:42.272 --> 47:44.348
but an Indian uprising
will end them forever.

47:45.859 --> 47:49.109
- You first, Dad Gautier.
- I offer for Dirk Rourke!

47:49.446 --> 47:52.780
- You will not do it in this house!
- Cecille, get out of the room!

47:53.075 --> 47:55.032
You have all gone crazy.

47:55.410 --> 47:57.736
You can not stop the railway.

47:58.080 --> 48:00.535
If you believe his lies, you will die.

48:00.874 --> 48:02.783
There is nothing bad
on the railroad

48:03.252 --> 48:06.122
I traveled by train when I was going
to school in Montreal.

48:06.463 --> 48:09.215
They are wonderful,
they will bring us civilization ...

48:09.508 --> 48:11.132
Shut up!
Shut up, I tell you!

48:11.510 --> 48:14.131
You are a girl,
You will do what we do.

48:14.429 --> 48:16.303
- You will think like us!
- I do not want to do it!

48:16.682 --> 48:19.220
Do you stir up against your own people?

48:19.935 --> 48:22.640
My own daughter ...
You are no longer ours.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.852
Go and think about it,
You are still on time.

48:33.824 --> 48:35.069
Pass me the decanter.

48:48.839 --> 48:49.752
Cecille!

48:54.052 --> 48:55.297
I have spoken with your father.

48:55.804 --> 48:57.880
I said you feel it
and he will forgive you.

48:59.474 --> 49:04.931
You must be thinking about Tom Andrews,
otherwise, you would not talk like that. You speak like him.

49:05.272 --> 49:07.763
- Tom Andrews is gone.
- Of course he's gone.

49:08.692 --> 49:10.435
I was playing with you.

49:11.069 --> 49:13.691
There is a doctor in the railway
which seems very enamored.

49:14.948 --> 49:16.193
Lie.

49:18.702 --> 49:20.362
That's why he came back with them.

49:22.539 --> 49:27.415
Liar! Liar! Liar!

49:27.753 --> 49:31.038
Right now he is taking care of him
in the hospital, if he is still alive.

49:32.507 --> 49:33.752
He is sick!

49:36.929 --> 49:38.720
What happened to it? Tell me!

49:39.473 --> 49:42.806
I'll tell you, a bullet popped
Several boxes of dynamite.

49:43.769 --> 49:46.604
He did not die at the time,
but anyway he's going to die.

49:47.397 --> 49:49.390
It is better that you forget him.

49:55.113 --> 49:56.394
That man did not suit you.

49:57.824 --> 50:00.991
- I can make you happier than him.
- How do you know about the bullet?

50:04.498 --> 50:08.448
- You know because you shot her.
- No, Cecille, I did not shoot.

50:08.794 --> 50:13.586
Do not deny it. Do not deny it!
Assassin! Assassin!

50:14.091 --> 50:18.135
You will end up in the gallows!
Assassin! Assassin!

50:47.874 --> 50:51.789
He has been on the verge of death.
I do not know how he has done it.

50:53.088 --> 50:56.089
But he has come out of danger.
Will live

50:56.425 --> 51:00.719
Of course he will live! I was sure,
This man is made of steel.

51:01.221 --> 51:04.637
Now he has to sleep.
Nature will be your medicine.

51:05.392 --> 51:06.555
It's a miracle.

51:06.852 --> 51:09.390
He has not left his side
Not five minutes since it happened.

51:09.855 --> 51:11.764
The miracle is you.

51:24.494 --> 51:27.365
- Tom Andrews, where is he?
- Number six, miss.

51:27.748 --> 51:29.954
- But he can not enter.
- Wait, it can not happen there.

51:30.667 --> 51:33.075
I have to see him,
I have to enter...

51:33.378 --> 51:36.165
Wait a minute, miss. You can not pass.
You must be Cecille Gautier,

51:36.548 --> 51:39.751
He has told me about you.
I'm Dinamita Dawson, Tom's friend.

51:40.052 --> 51:44.548
- Nap...?
- Yes, it will be fine. Do not worry.

51:46.725 --> 51:48.100
Then why can not I see it?

51:48.352 --> 51:51.222
Because he is sick,
No one can see it at the moment.

51:52.147 --> 51:54.816
You see it, whenever you want.

52:19.424 --> 52:21.998
No, miss, you can not see it.
He has already heard the doctor.

52:22.386 --> 52:24.758
Who did you think it is?
For her, she is more than a patient.

52:25.097 --> 52:27.006
- Please no.
- He does not want to let me in

52:27.307 --> 52:29.383
because he is afraid.
She wants it for herself.

52:29.643 --> 52:32.051
Miss, why do not you use
common sense?

52:32.354 --> 52:34.311
I have to tell Tom
something you should know

52:34.606 --> 52:36.563
- No, miss, you stay here!
- Let me go!

52:36.817 --> 52:38.893
What I have to say to Tom
You can tell me.

52:40.279 --> 52:42.271
He already warned me that he had a lot of genius.
Come with me.

52:48.620 --> 52:50.280
Sit down and calm down.

52:56.753 --> 52:58.212
What should Tom know?

52:58.881 --> 53:02.463
Dirk Rourke blew up the dynamite
that caused the wounds. I know.

53:03.468 --> 53:05.046
Cursed bastard!

53:05.387 --> 53:07.214
He has organized the people to
fight against the railroad.

53:07.639 --> 53:10.889
And he has plans for spring.
I do not know which ones.

53:11.476 --> 53:14.762
- I tried to stop them, but ...
- The snake hides in the grass.

53:15.230 --> 53:17.602
I have come to help you however.

53:18.275 --> 53:21.311
He still loves Tom Andrews,
 true?

53:22.070 --> 53:24.110
- What does it matter now?
- Import and a lot.

53:24.406 --> 53:27.822
He has to go home,
for Tom and for his own safety.

53:28.118 --> 53:30.443
If he abandons his people now,
they will consider her a traitor,

53:30.829 --> 53:32.454
They could kill her.

53:32.706 --> 53:35.541
You should not take that risk.
If you want to help Tom,

53:35.876 --> 53:40.170
stay with them,
Find out what you can.

53:41.423 --> 53:42.621
Yes!

53:44.176 --> 53:48.921
And do not worry about the doctor, even
It has not given you any loving filter.

54:23.465 --> 54:26.549
- What's wrong, Mike?
- They've released the rails again, boss.

54:27.177 --> 54:30.676
- If this train had gotten there ...
- Have there been more explosions?

54:31.431 --> 54:35.263
Not for days, but they have attacked the
saves and have returned to steal in the powder magazine.

54:35.727 --> 54:38.515
- Anything can happen.
- Has that dog reappeared?

54:38.939 --> 54:41.975
Nobody has seen him since he left
of the camp two weeks ago.

54:57.833 --> 55:00.075
Now they have hurt us.

55:06.633 --> 55:09.005
Come, boys,
let's clear the way!

55:09.428 --> 55:11.301
Go back to work, come on,
to work!

55:16.268 --> 55:19.055
We are weeks late.
Sabotage has prevented

55:19.479 --> 55:23.691
the arrival of materials.
We will not be able to afford the expenses.

55:24.401 --> 55:28.399
The men's pay will not come
on time. There will be complications.

55:28.780 --> 55:30.191
I wish i was there.
When will the jobs stop?

55:30.532 --> 55:33.486
One of these days, the weather gets worse.
Well, at least

55:34.703 --> 55:37.574
it will give us time to reorganize
and we will have all the winter

55:37.873 --> 55:40.411
to find the formula
to end sabotage.

55:40.709 --> 55:43.876
- I have some personal matters ...
- We will get it.

55:44.254 --> 55:45.285
We have to do it.

55:45.631 --> 55:47.623
Edith has told me that for spring
It will be like new.

55:48.008 --> 55:51.591
A great woman. If I had not given
his blood on the train that night ...

55:52.429 --> 55:54.220
but anyway, it has already happened.

55:54.514 --> 55:57.302
- She gave me her blood?
- I did not know, I did not know it?

55:57.976 --> 56:00.265
Yes, and he saved his life.

56:01.355 --> 56:02.635
Goodbye, Tom.

56:05.108 --> 56:07.564
- What's up, Mr. Van Horne?
- Where have you been these weeks?

56:07.903 --> 56:12.364
Over there, private matters.
My poor grandmother broke a leg

56:12.699 --> 56:15.155
I have splinted it myself.
Good job.

56:15.452 --> 56:19.319
You also have work in the camp.
If you do not return, you will stop having it.

56:25.337 --> 56:28.006
- How are you, mate?
- Worse when I've seen you.

56:28.340 --> 56:30.214
What is that story of your grandmother?

56:30.551 --> 56:32.876
I did not want to tell you what I've been
doing really.

56:33.804 --> 56:37.967
Tom, have you stopped to think
Why did that dynamite explode?

56:38.392 --> 56:42.804
I thought I heard a rifle shot before
of the explosion, but I'm not sure.

56:43.146 --> 56:44.475
Well, you can be sure.

56:44.856 --> 56:47.608
And I know who did it: Dirk Rourke.

56:48.944 --> 56:51.861
- How did you find out?
- I've been researching there.

56:52.739 --> 56:55.740
It occurred to me to keep track
to Rourke through the mountains.

56:57.244 --> 57:00.031
I thought about adjusting the accounts
for what he did to you.

57:00.414 --> 57:02.656
- You killed him?
- No, damn it.

57:02.958 --> 57:05.994
- I could not reach that dog.
- Do not do anything, Dynamite.

57:06.378 --> 57:08.620
If Rourke is behind this,
I will take care of him.

57:08.964 --> 57:11.835
Of course he is behind this,
From the beginning.

57:12.384 --> 57:15.385
And he has other plans
cooking in the pot.

57:16.722 --> 57:19.295
We are going to have a lot of work
this spring.

57:19.975 --> 57:21.553
Rourke is a demon!

57:23.061 --> 57:26.845
I'll go on that train to the camp,
In the spring I will not be around.

57:28.108 --> 57:30.943
- Take care, Tom!
- Thanks for coming,

57:31.361 --> 57:33.318
- and for encouraging me.
- Man...

57:46.585 --> 57:48.992
I hope those men will not have
bothered with bad news.

57:49.338 --> 57:50.618
Not all it's rigth.

58:00.474 --> 58:01.802
I will change the bandage.

58:02.935 --> 58:06.884
Do you always treat your patients
as if they were poor little animals?

58:08.357 --> 58:09.851
I do not understand what you say.

58:10.192 --> 58:12.434
They told me about the blood
what he gave me

58:12.819 --> 58:14.278
Why had not he told me?

58:14.696 --> 58:17.781
I did not think it was important. I would have
made by any other man.

58:18.784 --> 58:20.823
But the important thing
It is that he did it for me.

58:21.745 --> 58:22.741
Thank you.

58:26.833 --> 58:29.751
Now that I have your blood, do not you think
that we have something in common?

58:30.921 --> 58:32.201
Of course not.

58:35.926 --> 58:38.132
Edith, you should have feelings
warmer,

58:38.512 --> 58:41.762
because we are going to be isolated
for the snow enough time.

59:15.465 --> 59:16.497
Hello, Mr. Van Horne.

59:17.092 --> 59:19.879
- He has a very good face.
- I'm new. Sit down

59:20.429 --> 59:21.804
Thanks, it will only be a moment.

59:23.181 --> 59:26.515
I want you to return to the camp
as soon as you are able to travel.

59:26.852 --> 59:27.682
What happen?

59:27.978 --> 59:30.730
We have already resumed the laying
of the road, but things go wrong.

59:31.023 --> 59:33.062
It's not about sabotage,
It is in the same camp.

59:33.358 --> 59:35.896
- Men do not want to work.
- The pay has not arrived?

59:36.236 --> 59:38.608
The funds are withheld
for the bureaucracy.

59:38.906 --> 59:40.863
I'm going to Calgary to solve it.

59:41.158 --> 59:43.731
But the promises are no longer
to reassure men.

59:44.328 --> 59:46.735
They have always had
Much respect, Tom.

59:47.080 --> 59:49.406
If I could be there at least
a few days and calm them,

59:49.833 --> 59:52.039
I would have time to get
the money.

59:53.212 --> 59:58.039
- Edith, what happened to your hair?
- I've changed my hairstyle, why?

59:58.926 --> 01:00:00.040
It is prettier.

01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:05.758
Much more!

01:00:20.405 --> 01:00:25.910
How I love you, Tom! I've been
looking for the reason, but I can not find it.

01:00:26.328 --> 01:00:29.578
You are extraordinary, Edith, never
I can pay you what you gave me.

01:00:29.957 --> 01:00:33.123
You have already paid me, giving me
to meet the other Tom Andrews.

01:00:33.418 --> 01:00:34.367
The other?

01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:38.923
The one in here, the one who left
his home and he went to the border

01:00:39.216 --> 01:00:42.300
so as not to forget beautiful things
of the life.

01:00:42.678 --> 01:00:45.679
That is the man
what I admire and respect

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:49.260
No to Tom Andrews
that I met with those revolvers.

01:00:50.644 --> 01:00:54.642
I only cleaned them. Do you think that
Have I ever wanted to use them?

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.731
- But you've used them.
- There are times that a man ...

01:00:57.025 --> 01:00:59.433
There is no excuse to direct a weapon
against a similar.

01:00:59.861 --> 01:01:05.022
And if you feel for me what I believe,
you will never use them again, ever.

01:01:05.909 --> 01:01:09.777
Well ... they are a bit heavy
and I'm not as strong as before.

01:01:10.163 --> 01:01:11.706
I was sure you would say that.

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:15.622
Now you are my patient
and you will do what I tell you.

01:01:15.919 --> 01:01:17.711
The hospital wagon
will return to the camp tomorrow.

01:01:18.005 --> 01:01:19.380
That fits with my plans.

01:01:19.715 --> 01:01:22.965
The sick and convalescent
they will stay here, including you.

01:01:23.594 --> 01:01:24.756
But I have to go back.

01:01:25.053 --> 01:01:27.841
The doctor says no,
You need to rest another week.

01:01:28.307 --> 01:01:30.430
We will be separated,
but for a short time.

01:01:30.809 --> 01:01:35.138
What I send, doctor. But what if
Do you need the old "Buffalo Bill"?

01:01:35.439 --> 01:01:37.016
You are neither old nor "Buffalo Bill".

01:02:17.522 --> 01:02:22.101
Go, a stowaway.
It is violating the rules of the railroad.

01:02:22.486 --> 01:02:25.902
No, I just need fresh air
and have fun.

01:02:26.198 --> 01:02:29.946
I have not released you yet.
I can force you to stay in bed.

01:02:32.579 --> 01:02:34.121
Under surveillance.

01:02:34.957 --> 01:02:38.539
You are anxious to get back to work.
Come down and help me check the material.

01:02:38.835 --> 01:02:39.784
Right away.

01:02:40.462 --> 01:02:41.577
Sit down.

01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:44.039
Taking.

01:02:46.635 --> 01:02:50.004
- 20 dozens of surgical gauzes.
- What's up?

01:02:50.847 --> 01:02:53.884
Surgical
Write them here.

01:02:58.897 --> 01:03:01.388
And I say no. Never!

01:03:02.484 --> 01:03:06.612
The steel monster will devour you.
You have seen the buffalo disappear.

01:03:07.114 --> 01:03:09.106
Soon the earth itself will disappear.

01:03:09.533 --> 01:03:12.285
Unite your peoples
and expel them from your country.

01:03:28.969 --> 01:03:30.629
Look at them, did not I tell you?

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:34.217
If we manage to launch them against
the camp, we will finish them.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.426
Yes, we will shoot those thieves.

01:03:36.727 --> 01:03:39.348
My plan works. I have flooded
the whiskey camp

01:03:39.688 --> 01:03:41.597
and I have also set up a living room
to drink and play.

01:03:41.899 --> 01:03:44.899
If those imbeciles want to leave
the tools, they have it very easy.

01:03:45.861 --> 01:03:48.945
When those warriors go
by them they will fall like flies.

01:03:54.912 --> 01:03:58.530
There is no remedy. The bosses
of the tribes have fallen into the trap.

01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.286
It's the war!

01:04:00.876 --> 01:04:05.502
That madman of your father,
He does not know what he is doing.

01:04:06.298 --> 01:04:08.374
He does not realize that it is our
blood that will run,

01:04:09.009 --> 01:04:10.800
Not only
the one of the men of the railroad.

01:04:20.103 --> 01:04:21.646
I told you to stay
inside the house.

01:04:22.022 --> 01:04:25.356
Dad, do not you understand?
You must stop Dirk Rourke.

01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:29.150
No reason. And you should
be with us, with me

01:04:29.529 --> 01:04:32.021
I was, but look!

01:04:32.449 --> 01:04:34.821
Do you know what they would do with you
if now you opposed them?

01:04:35.244 --> 01:04:37.320
Belongs to the tribes,
it is your earth!

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:41.156
Talk to them, see if you get
convince them

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:48.372
Bosses, my daughter wants to talk to you
of the wonders of the railroad.

01:04:49.258 --> 01:04:51.630
Talk to them. Come on!

01:05:03.313 --> 01:05:07.441
Destroy the railway.
Get him out of your land!

01:05:09.111 --> 01:05:11.150
We will be with you
to death!

01:05:13.699 --> 01:05:18.574
Calm down, it's not time yet, come back
to your tribes. I will warn you.

01:05:21.707 --> 01:05:22.987
We'll talk when they leave.

01:05:29.756 --> 01:05:32.426
- Are you satisfied with me now?
- Much.

01:05:45.564 --> 01:05:48.980
I heard you
What you have done is terrible.

01:05:50.444 --> 01:05:51.357
Yes.

01:06:03.373 --> 01:06:05.781
Put some food here. I will warn
to Tom now that I can still.

01:06:06.168 --> 01:06:08.955
He is not your man anymore
You have seen him with another woman.

01:06:09.379 --> 01:06:11.752
Yes, someone who does not know anything
from all of this.

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:15.839
But it does not matter,
I have to warn him.

01:06:24.853 --> 01:06:28.187
You spoke well, Dirk,
You have convinced us!

01:06:29.983 --> 01:06:36.602
If you leave, it will be forever.
You will not be able to return with us. Never.

01:06:44.456 --> 01:06:48.121
Bye, Mom. I love you

01:07:18.282 --> 01:07:20.155
There goes the last of the bosses.

01:07:21.285 --> 01:07:25.033
- For the hair hunters!
- Cheers!

01:08:09.499 --> 01:08:12.833
Come on, to work! It seems that
You have not seen a train in life!

01:08:13.337 --> 01:08:14.747
Yes, but I do not see the office car.

01:08:18.966 --> 01:08:21.423
- Where is the money car?
- That, where is it?

01:08:21.761 --> 01:08:23.090
Let's find out!

01:08:23.555 --> 01:08:26.509
Let's see what he tells us now
Van Horne.

01:08:55.254 --> 01:08:57.709
- What's up, friends?
- Wow, it's Tom Andrews.

01:08:58.131 --> 01:08:59.211
Welcome, Tom!

01:09:00.259 --> 01:09:03.295
- And Mr. Van Horne is in Calgary.
- Where's the pay, Andrews?

01:09:03.636 --> 01:09:05.630
What are you going to spend here
the money?

01:09:06.014 --> 01:09:07.758
Mr. Van Horne promised you
what would you charge?

01:09:08.058 --> 01:09:10.514
- We're tired of promises.
- You will be charged within a couple of days.

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:12.768
We are also fed up
to hear that!

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:17.441
I understand that you are impatient,
boys

01:09:17.818 --> 01:09:19.941
I would be the same if I were
working in the sun all day,

01:09:20.237 --> 01:09:21.612
and I did not see the pay.

01:09:21.904 --> 01:09:24.028
I am not a liar,
and almost everyone knows it.

01:09:24.323 --> 01:09:26.898
And I tell you not to worry,
the money is on the way.

01:09:27.243 --> 01:09:29.734
I'm tired of hearing promises.
They are just lies.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.538
Let's destroy this!

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:36.372
- Be careful what you do!
- Give them their due, Tom!

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.745
Let's go.

01:09:40.256 --> 01:09:41.372
Let's go!

01:09:41.716 --> 01:09:42.831
But Tom,
What are you waiting for?

01:09:43.135 --> 01:09:44.629
What you break will be
discounted from the pay.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:48.006
Go back to work and do not do nonsense.
You have to build a railway!

01:09:48.849 --> 01:09:54.852
A tough guy! With pants
ironed and well combed!

01:09:55.606 --> 01:09:57.764
Have you forgotten your weapons?

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:00.937
What's wrong, Andrews,
is that you're a coward?

01:10:01.361 --> 01:10:03.687
Let's go guys,
to the Bailey's joint.

01:10:05.908 --> 01:10:08.030
Listen to me, the construction
of this line is more important

01:10:08.327 --> 01:10:09.655
that personal problems ...

01:10:16.376 --> 01:10:18.001
You've done what you can, Tom.

01:10:18.295 --> 01:10:20.418
No, I should have done
that swallowed the molars.

01:10:26.803 --> 01:10:29.555
- Tom, can you know what's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:33.804
You do not carry weapons, take and give it your due
that scoundrel, son of a bad mother.

01:10:34.144 --> 01:10:37.311
- The times change.
- What did that woman do to you?

01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:42.266
Do not you see that you can not handle a
herd of beasts with good words?

01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:44.278
Maybe yes.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.187
BAlLEY'S SALOON
THE LONGEST BAR IN THE WORLD

01:11:30.617 --> 01:11:33.073
Hey, hey, tonight the house invites,
Boys.

01:11:33.453 --> 01:11:38.828
There are five barrels of whiskey paid
and you just have to open them, so to drink.

01:11:42.713 --> 01:11:44.836
- Tell them the truth, Bailey.
- Shut.

01:11:45.215 --> 01:11:47.671
Tell them that the whiskey has given it to you
our friend.

01:11:48.218 --> 01:11:50.175
- That's why you give it away.
- You shut up.

01:11:50.637 --> 01:11:53.923
That's interesting, have you heard
What Mallis said?

01:11:54.349 --> 01:11:57.101
He sent the whiskey for us to drink
and we destroy the works.

01:11:57.436 --> 01:11:58.135
Shut up!

01:11:58.478 --> 01:12:00.021
You are not going to cheat me!

01:12:07.696 --> 01:12:10.021
To the one that takes out a weapon
I leave it dry.

01:12:11.992 --> 01:12:15.657
That's better.
The house is still inviting.

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:28.547
Tom, they just hurt Mallis
in the Bailey gambling den,

01:12:28.884 --> 01:12:30.544
- I think he's going to palmar her.
- I have to go!

01:12:35.557 --> 01:12:36.339
Edith, wait!

01:12:36.642 --> 01:12:40.342
But Bailey has killed Scott,
You can not go like that, you have to wear ...

01:12:58.455 --> 01:12:59.949
Now you look like a man!

01:13:07.881 --> 01:13:09.708
They have hurt a man here,
to Mallis.

01:13:10.259 --> 01:13:11.753
He just left
By the back door.

01:13:12.177 --> 01:13:15.178
- I'm a doctor, if he's hurt.
- He's not hurt, he's dead.

01:13:15.806 --> 01:13:16.968
A drink?

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:20.343
Come, sister, let's dance.

01:13:22.062 --> 01:13:23.521
Take your hands off!

01:13:28.485 --> 01:13:30.608
- Get out of here, Edith.
- Mallis is dead.

01:13:31.029 --> 01:13:32.274
Go back to the car.

01:13:49.089 --> 01:13:50.417
- Are you Bailey?
- Yes

01:13:51.341 --> 01:13:52.504
Well, you're going to close.

01:13:53.927 --> 01:13:58.007
It does not have to be like this,
the fight is over.

01:13:58.515 --> 01:14:01.386
We were going to pray a response
to friend Mallis.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:04.301
- A drink?
- You're going to come with me.

01:14:04.646 --> 01:14:06.888
I'm going to lock you up for murdering
to Scotty and Mallis.

01:14:09.151 --> 01:14:13.528
You saved yourself once, Andrews,
This you will not tell!

01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:27.790
Did you want to pray? On knees!

01:14:31.673 --> 01:14:33.132
Dynamite, collect the weapons.

01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:40.841
To avoid more shootings, for now
I'm going to keep my weapons.

01:14:41.266 --> 01:14:45.430
When you get drunk,
think about what you have seen here.

01:14:46.104 --> 01:14:49.390
We'll talk tomorrow morning,
and this time you are going to listen to me.

01:15:19.721 --> 01:15:21.050
Are you sure the cable will resist?

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:23.632
Yes, damn it, it will resist.

01:15:26.311 --> 01:15:29.396
Tom, listen to me, throw it down
with dynamite.

01:15:29.731 --> 01:15:32.139
And fly the whole camp?
Oh no!

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.269
Ready, Jim?

01:15:36.613 --> 01:15:37.609
Anytime.

01:15:37.906 --> 01:15:39.400
- Ready?
- Give him pressure!

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.575
- Ahead.
- Very well.

01:16:02.472 --> 01:16:04.845
Good job, Jim!
Are you going back to base tonight?

01:16:05.142 --> 01:16:06.719
- Right now.
- If you see Mr. Van Horne

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:09.018
tell him what happened,
tell him he does not have to worry.

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:12.273
- What's wrong, Dynamite?
- That's it, I've already released the cable!

01:16:12.858 --> 01:16:14.518
- See you, Tom!
- Good trip, Jim!

01:16:29.416 --> 01:16:32.702
Dynamite, we have work,
It's time to open the room.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.453
I once read a sign in a bar
from Montana that said:

01:16:38.884 --> 01:16:41.375
If you want to know who is in charge here,
look for a fight

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:45.802
Well, I do not want to send,
let alone fight,

01:16:46.141 --> 01:16:47.470
but someone is looking for it

01:16:47.976 --> 01:16:51.594
and does not plan to stop
until I finish with this railroad.

01:16:52.689 --> 01:16:55.643
Everything that has happened,
the accidents, the Bailey thing,

01:16:56.068 --> 01:16:58.606
everything is part of a plan
to take away our work,

01:16:58.862 --> 01:17:02.812
Are we going to spoil it or are we going
to finish what we have come to do?

01:17:03.116 --> 01:17:04.397
Build this line

01:17:04.993 --> 01:17:08.196
I say that if what you said
of the pay is true,

01:17:08.956 --> 01:17:11.956
- then right now to work.
- Is right!

01:17:12.334 --> 01:17:14.243
I will not allow anyone
I took my job.

01:17:14.711 --> 01:17:16.455
This is how it is spoken, boys!

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:21.672
I'll tell you something else, there is a man
behind all this and I know who he is.

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:27.589
If you all go back to work, I'll go
to look for it, and I will bring it alive or dead

01:17:27.891 --> 01:17:28.970
so you can see it

01:17:29.268 --> 01:17:30.466
Who is that viper?

01:17:31.979 --> 01:17:35.264
It is not so easy to find
and it is a personal matter.

01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:38.438
But once I have it in my hands
everything will go perfectly.

01:17:38.777 --> 01:17:41.066
Well, what do you say, guys?

01:17:44.199 --> 01:17:47.615
Tom, if you devote yourself to politics,
you would become president.

01:17:49.121 --> 01:17:50.235
Hey, wait!

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:01.252
Tom, the Indians are going to attack
the camp

01:18:01.592 --> 01:18:02.587
Lndians?
What had he told you?

01:18:02.968 --> 01:18:05.376
They have rifles, there are hundreds of them.
Dirk Rourke has driven them crazy.

01:18:05.679 --> 01:18:06.842
You have to flee from here!

01:18:07.139 --> 01:18:08.467
We can not run away,
We do not have a locomotive.

01:18:08.807 --> 01:18:10.349
So that Father Lacomb
talk to them,

01:18:10.684 --> 01:18:13.009
- He will make you see reason.
- Father Lacomb has returned to the base.

01:18:13.395 --> 01:18:14.593
Listen!

01:18:17.691 --> 01:18:20.063
Boys, are you listening?
We are going to have to defend ourselves.

01:18:21.111 --> 01:18:23.400
Quick, you have to bring the car
Hospital up here!

01:19:22.756 --> 01:19:23.705
Here is OK!

01:19:24.341 --> 01:19:25.290
- Hey, Mike!
- Yes?

01:19:25.676 --> 01:19:27.633
Put naughty around
to make a barricade.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:29.713
Hank, gather all the weapons
and ammunition there is.

01:19:30.055 --> 01:19:32.297
Dynamite, repeating rifles.
Cecille, come with me.

01:19:43.068 --> 01:19:45.440
Jake, telegraph to the base,
the camp is going to be attacked.

01:19:45.904 --> 01:19:48.063
Attacked? I can not communicate
for an hour

01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:49.735
They have had to cut the cables.

01:19:50.033 --> 01:19:52.868
- Then go out and use this.
- Yes sir.

01:19:54.496 --> 01:19:57.414
Your help has allowed us to prepare,
but you've got yourself in the worst place.

01:19:57.749 --> 01:20:00.287
I do not care,
I could not let them do it ...

01:20:00.627 --> 01:20:02.003
You are a very brave woman.

01:20:02.379 --> 01:20:06.875
Tom, I ... Listen ... drums.
Are getting closer!

01:20:22.232 --> 01:20:24.521
- Is it true what they say?
- Yes, climb the two to the car.

01:20:24.902 --> 01:20:27.190
- I want to help you, Tom!
- Inside. You, too, Dr. Mason.

01:20:28.655 --> 01:20:30.814
Come on, guys, behind
of the barricade!

01:20:31.116 --> 01:20:33.524
- Tom, does Van Horne know?
- No, they've cut the wires.

01:20:48.717 --> 01:20:50.626
- I'm going to warn Van Horne.
- You can not go away.

01:20:51.011 --> 01:20:53.004
No, stay, you're a good shooter.

01:20:53.305 --> 01:20:56.804
And a good rider, once I won
the one from Kentucky, on a mule!

01:20:58.894 --> 01:21:00.851
- Bye.
- Good luck, Dynamite!

01:21:17.829 --> 01:21:20.320
There are snipers,
They want to eliminate us little by little.

01:21:25.128 --> 01:21:26.539
If you want to help,
the bandages are there.

01:21:26.838 --> 01:21:28.297
I would help more with a rifle!

01:21:37.724 --> 01:21:39.516
As in a fair shot.

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:03.788
Boss!

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:08.080
May your men remain hidden,
We will keep the siege until nightfall

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:09.755
then I will give the attack signal.

01:22:10.257 --> 01:22:12.048
And the one that has galloped
A while ago?

01:22:12.342 --> 01:22:15.676
It will not get very far. I have put
Indian lookouts on all roads.

01:22:16.555 --> 01:22:21.051
In case anyone wants to go and tell them.

01:22:56.386 --> 01:22:57.715
You're casting lots, huh?

01:23:00.974 --> 01:23:03.465
Let's see who is the lucky one
that pulls my hair

01:23:04.519 --> 01:23:06.726
Well that's not right,
It is not being civilized.

01:23:13.195 --> 01:23:18.616
Boss, will you let me smoke the last cigarette
before going to the great meadows?

01:23:24.331 --> 01:23:27.083
Do you also want?
Well, I have many.

01:23:27.543 --> 01:23:31.457
We are going to be friends. One for you,
another for you, there is for everyone.

01:23:31.838 --> 01:23:33.997
The best tobacco you've ever tried.
Take fire, boss.

01:23:34.925 --> 01:23:39.634
You will like it, boys,
chupad strong.

01:23:40.055 --> 01:23:42.807
If you do not have fire
Ask another, huh?

01:24:31.315 --> 01:24:33.058
They're up to something, Mike.

01:24:33.859 --> 01:24:35.686
That some of your men climb
to the wagon,

01:24:35.986 --> 01:24:36.982
the others that hide underneath.

01:24:37.321 --> 01:24:41.105
But do not leave this barricade.
Tell everyone

01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:03.844
Be well,
do not waste ammunition.

01:25:07.768 --> 01:25:08.764
Thanks, Cecille!

01:25:43.053 --> 01:25:44.168
Be careful, do not come near.

01:25:44.471 --> 01:25:45.550
It's hurt!

01:25:49.851 --> 01:25:51.262
They are very treacherous.

01:25:51.728 --> 01:25:54.480
Help me, you have to get him out of here.
Open the door.

01:25:57.276 --> 01:25:58.853
Relieves suffering first
of ours.

01:25:59.236 --> 01:26:00.695
Compassion does not make distinctions.

01:26:01.113 --> 01:26:04.446
You started this. The violence
It always brings more violence.

01:26:04.783 --> 01:26:06.028
Are you blaming me?

01:26:06.326 --> 01:26:09.446
To you personally clear that no.
I blame the ideas you defend.

01:26:09.997 --> 01:26:11.621
I thought you had changed,

01:26:11.999 --> 01:26:14.786
but it takes a lot of courage to
give up spilling blood.

01:26:16.211 --> 01:26:18.583
We have caught one of them, it came out
running from among the trees.

01:26:18.881 --> 01:26:19.912
Father!

01:26:24.344 --> 01:26:28.093
Cecille, mom told me
that you came to warn them.

01:26:28.724 --> 01:26:32.804
I did not think it would be so horrible ...
Horrible ... I was wrong.

01:26:34.396 --> 01:26:35.641
What does Rourke plan?

01:26:36.231 --> 01:26:39.766
It's up there,
next to the dry pine, the big one.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.856
When I give the signal
the final attack will begin.

01:26:45.782 --> 01:26:48.700
They are too many.
You can not ... resist.

01:27:23.153 --> 01:27:24.813
Already! Turn it on, Cagle.

01:27:32.913 --> 01:27:33.909
Stay there!

01:29:35.661 --> 01:29:38.578
Take, fight!
Do you want to die?

01:29:42.834 --> 01:29:44.827
She is crazy or she is a saint!

01:29:56.265 --> 01:29:58.506
He says he can not go faster,
Mr. Van Horne

01:29:58.850 --> 01:30:01.520
if it gives you more pressure,
the boiler is going to burst.

01:30:16.368 --> 01:30:19.571
I could not stop them from giving the signal.
Rourke is dead.

01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:21.076
Did you kill him?

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:23.740
Why would not he do it?
He was responsible for everything!

01:30:24.209 --> 01:30:26.534
- I'm glad, Tom, I'm glad.
- You are injured!

01:30:40.851 --> 01:30:41.847
They attack us!

01:31:11.381 --> 01:31:12.876
The train, Tom, the train!

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:15.583
Fire at will!

01:32:21.493 --> 01:32:23.901
Hey, Tom, what do you think?
of the work of the railroad?

01:32:24.246 --> 01:32:26.369
As your personal explorer,
most of the time it's very hard,

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:28.082
But I like it.

01:32:30.335 --> 01:32:31.450
Father Lacomb!

01:32:31.795 --> 01:32:34.037
Mr. Von Horne, Dynamite
He has behaved like the good guys.

01:32:34.464 --> 01:32:35.959
By the way,
Why have you taken so long?

01:32:36.383 --> 01:32:39.170
Because I entertained myself by smoking
the cigar of peace with some Indians

01:32:39.845 --> 01:32:42.336
and certainly rest in peace.

01:32:53.692 --> 01:32:55.067
Money money money!

01:32:56.111 --> 01:32:59.776
If money is the root of all evils,
give me a car from those roots.

01:33:00.198 --> 01:33:01.942
Your father will recover
Soon, Cecille.

01:33:02.326 --> 01:33:03.488
Do you come with us?

01:33:03.785 --> 01:33:06.359
- I'll accompany you on the next train.
- Goodbye.

01:33:13.128 --> 01:33:15.204
For all the saints,
what is this?

01:33:19.885 --> 01:33:21.877
Oh, mother, we have problems.

01:33:36.568 --> 01:33:38.110
What do you want, boss?

01:33:50.123 --> 01:33:51.203
What it says?

01:33:51.583 --> 01:33:53.161
They want to sign peace
with the white man.

01:33:53.585 --> 01:33:55.412
They want to return to their tribes
in peace.

01:33:55.754 --> 01:33:58.327
They will stay there
and they will not attack us again.

01:33:58.757 --> 01:34:00.299
Tell them that I agree
to your wishes.

01:34:00.842 --> 01:34:03.879
The white boss says he grants you
everything you have asked for

01:34:04.263 --> 01:34:08.130
I ask you to believe me, not like
priest, but as a white man

01:34:08.684 --> 01:34:12.135
that understands whites
and the Indians.

01:34:33.417 --> 01:34:34.412
Tom!
