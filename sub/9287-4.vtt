WEBVTT

00:58.033 --> 01:00.672
Hey, what are you doing there?

01:23.593 --> 01:25.470
Max!

01:25.553 --> 01:27.783
Joshua!

01:27.873 --> 01:30.023
How'd you get here?

01:30.113 --> 01:32.308
Did anyone see you?

01:32.793 --> 01:35.432
It's OK. He's a friend.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.231
Yeah, sure.

01:37.313 --> 01:39.952
You just threw me back there, that's all.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.830
You're Joshua, right?

01:41.913 --> 01:44.188
Joshua. Right.

01:44.273 --> 01:46.468
Original Cindy. Good to meet you.

01:47.553 --> 01:49.703
I'm makin' breakfast. You hungry?

01:54.153 --> 01:56.587
I was gonna come by
and bring you some stuff.

01:56.673 --> 01:59.426
- Come to find Father.
- Father? Who's Father?

01:59.513 --> 02:03.347
Sandeman. He made us.
He's gonna make Max better.

02:03.433 --> 02:06.106
Your love-bug thing
where you can't touch Logan?

02:06.193 --> 02:08.866
Well, get on it, boo.
I'm tired of seeing you mopin'.

02:08.953 --> 02:13.026
This virus bitch has gotta go down
so that you can get busy with your man.

02:13.553 --> 02:17.512
Max and Logan getting busy. That's the plan.

02:17.593 --> 02:21.711
The plan is we're gonna find Father.
Logan's tracking down some leads.

02:21.793 --> 02:25.706
In the meantime, you gotta lay low.
You can't be walking around out there.

02:25.793 --> 02:28.261
Don't mope. I'm on it.

02:31.073 --> 02:33.382
You want some more? We got more food.

02:33.873 --> 02:34.908
Down.

02:35.833 --> 02:37.061
OK.

03:02.713 --> 03:04.704
Eight dollar.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.183
Chill, Pop. It wasn't me, I swear.

04:23.273 --> 04:26.868
Somebody call an ambulance.
Somebody call an ambulance!

04:50.353 --> 04:55.029
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

04:55.113 --> 04:57.104
Then she escaped.

04:57.193 --> 05:01.550
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

05:01.633 --> 05:03.942
she is haunted by her past.

05:04.033 --> 05:09.027
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

05:44.353 --> 05:46.193
So then I ran a search
of university records.

05:46.193 --> 05:46.591
So then I ran a search
of university records.

05:46.673 --> 05:49.392
Figured if Sandeman
was the genius behind Manticore,

05:49.473 --> 05:53.910
he'd probably have some sort of degree
in genetics or biochemistry or something.

05:53.993 --> 05:58.544
- Anything turn up?
- A couple of PhDs but nothing in sciences.

06:00.273 --> 06:04.186
- And what about the house?
- His name wasn't on it.

06:04.273 --> 06:08.585
Mortgage held by an offshore corporation
and the taxes paid from a numbered account.

06:09.273 --> 06:12.231
If you're splicing genes
for a secret government agency,

06:12.313 --> 06:15.350
gotta make sure you cover your tracks.

06:15.433 --> 06:19.870
In May of '08, the bank repo'ed the property
after six months of non-payment,

06:19.953 --> 06:21.944
and it's sat there empty ever since.

06:22.033 --> 06:26.584
- Looks like Sandeman just disappeared.
- Maybe he retired someplace sunny.

06:26.673 --> 06:29.824
Or he ran for his life.
We're talking about Manticore.

06:29.913 --> 06:32.507
The place wasn't exactly
known for job security.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.629
Yeah, well.

06:34.713 --> 06:38.672
If he had time to pack his bags,
he probably would've taken this.

06:43.073 --> 06:47.191
The Manticore symbol.
We're sure he's one of the good guys?

06:47.273 --> 06:49.867
Joshua's sure. That's enough for me.

06:49.953 --> 06:52.342
Maybe we could check it for prints or DNA.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.503
- I don't know. After ten years?
- Worth a shot.

06:54.593 --> 06:57.187
We got nothing on this guy.
Not even a first name.

06:57.513 --> 07:01.392
I'll call Matt Sung.
See if he can get the police lab to do it.

07:02.393 --> 07:06.386
We're gonna find him, Max.
And we're gonna beat this.

07:07.393 --> 07:09.907
I just want things to be the way they were.

07:09.993 --> 07:13.872
You know, when we could hold hands
without you keeling over on me.

07:20.713 --> 07:23.466
- Asha.
- I just got this close to getting busted.

07:23.553 --> 07:25.908
- Listen...
- They ran my papers on the computer.

07:25.993 --> 07:29.588
I knew they were onto them being forged
because they took forever.

07:29.673 --> 07:31.664
So I just got the hell outta there.

07:31.753 --> 07:35.462
- That's a smart move.
- All I wanna do is go home and take a bath.

07:35.553 --> 07:38.625
- Now I gotta find a new fake ID.
- I can probably help with that.

07:38.713 --> 07:40.431
We gotta talk about Manticore.

07:40.513 --> 07:45.541
I'm glad your friend Max and her furry little
friends got outta there, but it's really...

07:45.633 --> 07:48.272
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:48.753 --> 07:52.792
What I meant was we... My group, that is...

07:52.873 --> 07:55.262
The S1Ws,
the political organisation I was...

07:55.353 --> 08:00.632
Yeah. Government's saying Manticore was
just a VA hospital you guys burned down.

08:00.713 --> 08:03.944
Sorry. From me and all my furry little friends.

08:06.233 --> 08:09.031
I gotta get to work. Have fun.

08:15.193 --> 08:17.502
"All I wanna do is take a bath."

08:17.593 --> 08:19.788
All I wanna do is drown her in one.

08:37.073 --> 08:42.272
Don't get mad. It's not her fault
everything handcuffs you to Manticore.

08:42.513 --> 08:45.869
But what is up?
Is someone trying to tell me something?

08:55.673 --> 08:57.903
- Rafer?
- Lie still.

08:58.433 --> 09:01.391
- I'm OK.
- I don't know. You went down pretty hard.

09:01.473 --> 09:04.385
- That was you?
- Sorry. You came out of nowhere.

09:04.913 --> 09:07.632
- What the hell are you doing?
- Relax. I'm a paramedic.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.386
- You deliver pizzas.
- That was just part time.

09:10.473 --> 09:13.112
We spent a night together
and you think you know me?

09:13.193 --> 09:15.627
Lie still.
I gotta check for broken bones.

09:18.073 --> 09:22.225
Next time you wanna cop a feel,
hit me harder and make sure I'm out cold.

09:22.313 --> 09:24.907
No damage. Just a scratch!

09:25.353 --> 09:27.344
Max.

09:37.673 --> 09:39.982
- Matt, did you get it?
- Yeah, just arrived.

09:40.073 --> 09:42.871
Listen, I appreciate you doing this.

09:42.953 --> 09:43.393
No problem.
I'll send the results as soon as I can.

09:43.393 --> 09:45.429
No problem.
I'll send the results as soon as I can.

09:45.513 --> 09:47.151
Great.

09:47.913 --> 09:49.904
Biochemist. I'm a scientist.

09:49.993 --> 09:53.508
I'm sure you got a great team of
scientists working at the precinct.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.426
Hello. The boy that died today
in Chinatown, I was there.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.504
I may have been exposed to something.

09:58.593 --> 10:02.142
The coroner's still investigating.
We'll have her report tomorrow.

10:02.233 --> 10:06.067
- I would like to see a copy of that.
- File a request with the ME's office.

10:06.153 --> 10:09.350
- This is totally unacceptable...
- Just follow him.

10:09.433 --> 10:10.707
- Sung.
- Yeah?

10:10.793 --> 10:13.512
You had a sketch artist
working on something?

10:13.593 --> 10:17.552
Yeah. Rumours flying around Chinatown
about some strange guy in an overcoat.

10:17.633 --> 10:19.032
I'll say.

10:19.113 --> 10:21.752
The eyewitness says his face was bleeding.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.381
Could be the dead kid was exposed
to what he's got.

10:25.473 --> 10:27.941
Could be.

10:28.033 --> 10:32.868
Let's keep this under wraps until the autopsy
comes out. I don't want to start a panic.

10:32.953 --> 10:35.308
You haven't been in Chinatown lately.

10:35.393 --> 10:37.384
There's already a panic.

10:46.553 --> 10:48.430
What happened to you?

10:48.513 --> 10:50.947
Where you been?
Been paging you all morning.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.752
I lost my pager
when I got hit on Charles Street.

10:53.833 --> 10:57.428
- But I'm OK, thanks for asking.
- Here, hot run. Sector Nine.

10:57.513 --> 11:00.630
- Can I borrow...
- No. You're not covered on company bikes.

11:00.713 --> 11:03.750
If you so much as break a fingernail,
we both know you'll sue.

11:03.833 --> 11:08.509
Let's go! Bip-bip-bip!
It's called Jam Pony, not Jam Clydesdale.

11:11.433 --> 11:13.583
Hey.

11:13.673 --> 11:18.030
OK, you are a paramedic. You trying
to make me feel bad for not believing you?

11:18.113 --> 11:20.308
No. I came by to give you this.

11:21.553 --> 11:23.623
And to see if you wanted to have lunch.

11:23.713 --> 11:26.432
My way of making up
for our little run-in.

11:28.473 --> 11:31.829
- Listen, I'm really sorry about...
- Forget about it.

11:32.593 --> 11:37.303
How can I? I put my foot so far down
my mouth, I got teeth marks on my knee.

11:39.033 --> 11:41.024
She must hate me.

11:42.433 --> 11:46.142
Really, forget about it.
Eat something.

11:46.233 --> 11:48.224
I'm not really hungry.

11:50.993 --> 11:53.427
About what happened that night...

11:53.513 --> 11:57.188
- I'd rather just forget about that night.
- Me too.

11:57.273 --> 11:59.628
I was in a really weird head space.

11:59.713 --> 12:02.910
I just broke up with my girlfriend,
like, three weeks before.

12:02.993 --> 12:06.508
Anyway, if I came on too strong
I'm sorry, cos I'm not like that.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.072
It's OK.

12:08.153 --> 12:10.986
I came by a couple of times
and no one knew where you were.

12:11.073 --> 12:13.667
I had to deal with family stuff.
It's complicated.

12:13.753 --> 12:17.268
- Family stuff's always complicated.
- You have no idea.

12:19.993 --> 12:22.826
Thought maybe you had
a boyfriend somewhere.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.111
That's complicated too.

12:26.193 --> 12:30.232
Which has gotta be
the understatement of the century.

12:30.313 --> 12:33.828
Max and I danced around each other
for almost a year.

12:33.913 --> 12:38.589
When we finally figure out what's going on
between us, this virus thing happens.

12:38.673 --> 12:41.665
- We can't be together.
- What do you mean? Why not?

12:42.313 --> 12:44.463
It's hard to explain. It's like...

12:45.273 --> 12:47.503
It's too intense.

12:47.593 --> 12:49.353
Sometimes I think maybe
we're just not meant to be.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.423
Sometimes I think maybe
we're just not meant to be.

12:51.513 --> 12:54.710
I mean, if it's right,
why does it have to be so hard?

12:55.433 --> 12:57.424
I don't know.

12:58.633 --> 13:01.750
Logan's probably just better off without me.

13:03.633 --> 13:06.193
I just want you to be happy.

13:10.753 --> 13:12.744
He'd be lucky to be with you.

13:15.673 --> 13:18.233
Anybody would be.

13:28.353 --> 13:29.706
I should go.

13:29.793 --> 13:33.183
- I'd better get back to work.
- Yeah, me too.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.225
You don't have ID. Asha!

13:43.513 --> 13:45.868
See you around.

14:08.953 --> 14:11.342
This is your bus ticket, sir.

14:37.953 --> 14:40.706
Yeah, that mutant. I saw it here yesterday.

14:40.793 --> 14:42.909
Grabbed a pigeon, bit its head off.

14:46.313 --> 14:48.304
Looked at me like I was next.

14:49.793 --> 14:52.023
- It's worse than I thought.
- What?

14:52.113 --> 14:55.025
Mutant infestation. They're here as well.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.742
Were you born dumb or do you put in work?

15:08.233 --> 15:10.428
Ambulance, we gotta get an ambulance.

15:18.353 --> 15:20.184
22, all Chinese.

15:21.073 --> 15:24.110
- What did the ME say?
- If it's what killed the kid yesterday,

15:24.193 --> 15:28.345
it's some kind of pathogen.
She's never seen anything like it.

15:28.433 --> 15:33.587
- I mean, is it some kind of toxin or what?
- She's running tests, trying to figure it out.

15:33.673 --> 15:38.144
- You see Eyes Only's hack about Manticore?
- Yeah. Why?

15:38.233 --> 15:42.829
The government says it never existed, but the
word on the street is the place burned down

15:42.913 --> 15:45.825
and a bunch of genetically-engineered
whatsits got out.

15:45.913 --> 15:49.906
- Those are just rumours.
- There's a rumour one's hiding in Chinatown.

15:49.993 --> 15:52.553
Supposedly deformed,
bleeds through his skin.

15:52.633 --> 15:55.830
- You think they're connected?
- I don't know. Eyes Only might.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.427
- Can you talk to him for me?
- I'll try and get to him.

15:58.513 --> 16:00.504
- I appreciate it.
- Sure thing.

16:01.913 --> 16:04.871
Listen. I'm sorry, Matt.

16:05.353 --> 16:08.823
- I know this is close to home.
- Yeah.

16:10.793 --> 16:13.626
- It was horrible.
- Those poor people.

16:13.713 --> 16:17.592
The news said anybody there should
get checked for infection. I'm scared.

16:17.673 --> 16:20.267
Can I talk to you?

16:20.353 --> 16:22.583
Five minutes, then I start docking.

16:23.713 --> 16:28.867
Even if there is a screwed-up transgenic, it
doesn't mean he's got what killed the people.

16:28.953 --> 16:32.070
When you were at Manticore,
were you aware of any experiments

16:32.153 --> 16:35.907
that involved exposure
to virulent bacteria or pathogens?

16:35.993 --> 16:40.828
- No. Why are you jumping to conclusions?
- Because the guy's been seen in the area.

16:40.913 --> 16:45.464
If this is linked to me and my furry little
friends, why are all the victims Chinese?

16:45.553 --> 16:49.831
- Manticore's big on equal opportunity.
- Could be that it takes prolonged exposure.

16:49.913 --> 16:53.110
If this guy was downtown,
maybe it'd be rich white people dying.

16:53.193 --> 16:55.263
Ever think it was something they ate?

16:55.353 --> 16:58.823
Or they got bit by the same mosquito?
Or some bug got loose from a lab?

16:58.913 --> 17:00.904
Come on, Max!

17:00.993 --> 17:05.589
This is nothing new to Manticore. Look what
they did to you and me, for God's sake.

17:07.393 --> 17:11.386
Just because I'm poison doesn't mean
we all are. Your five minutes are up.

17:30.513 --> 17:32.902
Hold it right there.

17:39.913 --> 17:43.428
- I love what you've done with the place.
- Laying low.

17:43.513 --> 17:46.585
Good, cos it's dangerous out there,
especially these days.

17:47.313 --> 17:52.262
Like it here. Father's books. Father's house.

17:53.193 --> 17:56.629
Yeah. Listen, about Father.

17:56.713 --> 17:59.989
Logan's come up empty.
He's still working on it.

18:00.073 --> 18:03.986
He'll find Sandeman,
just as soon he's done saving the world...

18:04.673 --> 18:06.789
from us.

18:09.313 --> 18:12.669
Max and Logan. That's the plan.

18:12.753 --> 18:14.471
I don't know.

18:14.553 --> 18:19.069
I'm starting to think there is no plan,
and if there is I'm not clued in at all.

18:19.153 --> 18:21.621
Father ever talk to you about fate?

18:21.713 --> 18:26.070
You know, like whether
some things just weren't meant to be?

18:28.673 --> 18:31.585
Canine with human DNA not meant to be,

18:33.153 --> 18:34.552
then Joshua.

18:34.633 --> 18:37.227
Max and Logan not meant to be,

18:38.513 --> 18:39.992
then getting busy.

18:42.073 --> 18:44.633
- We'll see.
- You'll see.

18:44.713 --> 18:46.704
This virus bitch going down.

18:52.193 --> 18:54.388
It's him.

18:56.473 --> 18:58.782
- Hello.
- If you're calling to apologise...

18:58.873 --> 19:01.592
I'm not but I will if that's what it takes.

19:02.913 --> 19:05.108
Spit it out.

19:05.193 --> 19:05.633
- Asha was heading home and...
- She left already?

19:05.633 --> 19:08.306
- Asha was heading home and...
- She left already?

19:08.393 --> 19:13.513
Yeah, and she got arrested by sector cops.
I need your help.

19:13.993 --> 19:16.712
- You want me to save her?
- I don't know who else to ask.

19:16.793 --> 19:19.353
- Try Sung.
- I did. He's not answering his page.

19:19.833 --> 19:23.826
- Smart man.
- If they run her prints and see who she is...

19:23.913 --> 19:26.950
- Yeah, yeah. Where is she?
- Sector Four headquarters.

19:27.313 --> 19:29.622
We'll meet you at Crash in an hour.

19:32.473 --> 19:34.907
Look, I told you. I left my ID at work.

19:35.953 --> 19:38.342
I can bring it in tomorrow.

19:44.433 --> 19:48.984
Your prints came through, Ms Barlow.
We know you're with the S1W.

19:49.833 --> 19:52.631
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.988
I want the names and addresses
of everyone in your group.

19:57.073 --> 19:59.064
This is crazy.

20:00.073 --> 20:03.748
This department does not take
terrorist activities lightly.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.791
The S1W are not terrorists.

20:06.913 --> 20:10.588
Tell me what I want to know
or this is going to get ugly.

20:22.553 --> 20:24.384
I'm gonna kick your ass!

20:24.873 --> 20:27.865
I'm gonna kick your ass!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

20:34.873 --> 20:37.910
It's my thing. Come on.

20:43.193 --> 20:45.707
You know a girl named Max?
Hangs out here a lot?

20:45.793 --> 20:48.512
Yeah, hard to miss but hasn't been in tonight.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.109
- I'll have a beer.
- Take that one.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.342
You know Max?

20:57.433 --> 21:00.353
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

21:00.353 --> 21:00.671
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

21:01.273 --> 21:04.709
- Rafer.
- Logan.

21:06.393 --> 21:08.987
Right.

21:18.073 --> 21:21.748
Listen. Thanks.
I know you didn't have to.

21:22.713 --> 21:25.068
It was a favour to Logan.

21:25.153 --> 21:30.147
Besides, it wouldn't be right for you
to take the rap for something you didn't do.

21:31.313 --> 21:35.670
You going in? I'm just gonna get
my ID from Logan and go, so...

21:37.193 --> 21:41.186
- You're waiting here for Max, right?
- Yep.

21:42.833 --> 21:46.269
- That's my cue to go.
- You don't have to.

21:48.273 --> 21:53.063
- Things with Logan are screwed up just now.
- Yeah, but he's crazy about you.

21:53.153 --> 21:55.872
She digs you, man. I'm just gonna back off.

21:56.953 --> 21:59.148
Have a seat.

22:01.313 --> 22:06.706
I don't know how things are gonna
play out between us, so I'm gonna go.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.751
I wouldn't want to mess
anything up for her. Neil!

22:10.113 --> 22:11.831
Yeah?

22:11.913 --> 22:14.063
- You know Asha?
- Yeah, I know Asha.

22:15.353 --> 22:18.231
- I'll give it to her.
- Great. Thanks.

22:18.313 --> 22:19.507
See ya.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.106
Good night.

24:02.713 --> 24:05.750
Help! Help, help!

24:06.153 --> 24:07.302
Help!

24:08.273 --> 24:10.264
Help, help!

24:51.913 --> 24:55.747
What are you doing here?
I told you I'd call you.

24:56.193 --> 24:58.423
- He's clean.
- Clean?

24:58.513 --> 25:00.549
Not a trace of the pathogen.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.272
Let me take a look at that.

25:14.633 --> 25:16.863
What is that?

25:20.353 --> 25:23.026
Looks like a tattoo.

25:26.833 --> 25:30.462
Why do I get the feeling
you guys aren't tellin' me something here?

25:30.953 --> 25:34.070
- What's goin' on?
- You killed an innocent man.

25:34.753 --> 25:36.744
That's what's going on.

25:40.833 --> 25:44.951
- Looked like he was hurting the kid.
- We know, Matt.

25:45.033 --> 25:48.582
- Something killed all those people.
- Lab tests came back today.

25:48.673 --> 25:53.349
It's not an infectious agent.
They were exposed to the pathogen directly.

25:53.433 --> 25:57.221
- Where'd it come from?
- Don't know. I can tell you this.

25:57.313 --> 25:59.907
Mother Nature didn't cook this thing up.

25:59.993 --> 26:02.666
The pathogen's genetically engineered.

26:03.553 --> 26:06.021
If the pathogen's man-made,

26:06.113 --> 26:08.308
then either it escaped from a lab

26:08.393 --> 26:11.430
or somebody's exposing
people to it on purpose.

26:12.393 --> 26:15.430
No, don't worry. I got my hands on
a copy of the ME's report.

26:15.513 --> 26:17.708
They're chasing their tails.

26:18.393 --> 26:21.510
I'm ready when you are.
All I need is a test subject.

26:25.433 --> 26:27.822
I'll be expecting you.

26:29.833 --> 26:32.222
He was downstairs people.

26:33.313 --> 26:35.702
Didn't turn out so good.

26:35.793 --> 26:40.105
Lives in the basement in case Manticore
needs to cut him up for spare parts.

26:40.193 --> 26:44.232
Finally gets out in the world,
and they shoot him dead like he's an animal.

26:44.313 --> 26:48.465
This is why I'm always on you
because it's not safe out there.

26:48.553 --> 26:53.104
People get real scared
when things are different.

26:53.193 --> 26:58.347
Yeah, but what I forgot to tell you is, when
they get scared, they can get really mean.

26:59.713 --> 27:01.704
I'm sorry.

27:02.953 --> 27:07.469
There's a rumour going around the black
market about a new kind of bio-weapon,

27:07.553 --> 27:10.431
capable of distinguishing
between population groups.

27:10.513 --> 27:13.073
A nasty trick no one's been able
to pull off before.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.508
Maybe some kind of anti-Asian hate group.

27:15.593 --> 27:18.903
Maybe. Maybe what's happening
is some kind of field test.

27:19.793 --> 27:22.671
- Why do you say that?
- No one's claimed responsibility.

27:22.753 --> 27:26.587
And look at the way it's playing out -
starting with a single victim,

27:26.673 --> 27:29.141
then a handful in a narrowly targeted area.

27:29.393 --> 27:31.509
I'm not sure what's worse.

27:31.593 --> 27:37.031
Somebody's out to kill me and mine
or that they're using us as guinea pigs.

27:38.393 --> 27:41.988
- Got anything else for me?
- I'm working on some leads but it's slow.

27:42.073 --> 27:44.064
Internet's been crashing all day.

27:44.393 --> 27:46.588
- Do what you can.
- Talk to you later.

27:52.993 --> 27:54.108
Hello.

27:54.193 --> 27:58.391
Hey. I just wanted to call.

27:59.433 --> 28:03.267
- I never got to thank you for springing Asha.
- No big deal.

28:03.353 --> 28:08.791
And because you were right.
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.

28:08.873 --> 28:13.151
Whatever it was that killed those people
had nothing to do with transgenics.

28:13.233 --> 28:16.509
Guess our thing has just got me
a little spun, you know?

28:17.313 --> 28:19.304
Yeah, me too.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.224
Is that me or you?

28:21.313 --> 28:23.304
Think it's me. Hold on.

28:23.993 --> 28:27.952
- Logan? I'm at Crash. Come over.
- Max, come over. I'm at Crash.

28:28.033 --> 28:31.343
- I don't think so.
- Not tonight.

28:31.433 --> 28:33.901
I have someone on the other line.

28:33.993 --> 28:36.587
- All right.
- OK. See you.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.664
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:39.353 --> 28:42.902
- So.
- Anyway, I just wanted to say...

28:44.513 --> 28:48.267
sorry about everything.

28:49.513 --> 28:51.504
Yeah, me too.

28:53.713 --> 28:55.271
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:17.553 --> 29:19.544
- Hey, Max.
- Hey.

30:12.153 --> 30:14.030
What delays?

30:14.113 --> 30:18.345
I told you three steps
were gonna be involved. Did I not?

30:18.433 --> 30:21.903
Step one, target the pathogen
to a single individual.

30:21.993 --> 30:25.986
Expose him to it via airborne dispersal,
make sure he's the only one it affects.

30:26.073 --> 30:28.143
Went off without a hitch, did it not?

30:28.233 --> 30:30.701
Excuse me.
Could you not put that there, please?

30:30.793 --> 30:33.387
It is a very expensive piece of equipment.

30:34.473 --> 30:36.111
Thank you.

30:36.393 --> 30:37.906
Step two.

30:37.993 --> 30:41.429
Target the pathogen
to a specific race of people.

30:41.513 --> 30:43.663
The Chinese at the bus stop.

30:43.753 --> 30:49.191
I used gene expression on the base pair
for the epicanthic fold. You know, the eyelid?

30:49.273 --> 30:52.231
Worked perfectly. No one died but them, yes?

30:53.273 --> 30:57.903
Your technology is very impressive.
But let's move on to step three.

30:57.993 --> 31:00.951
I'm ready. You see,
it was easy with the Chinese.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.672
I had specific gene sequences
that I could target.

31:03.753 --> 31:07.792
But the kids you're targeting...
Wow, that was tough.

31:08.233 --> 31:11.384
Because they're just
a little bit of everything.

31:11.473 --> 31:12.701
- In the end...
- Cyril.

31:12.793 --> 31:15.591
...I targeted
their immunological surveillance cells.

31:15.673 --> 31:20.383
Cyril! Action is character.
Show me some.

31:20.473 --> 31:21.513
- I showed you, didn't I?
- Yes.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.309
- I showed you, didn't I?
- Yes.

31:22.393 --> 31:25.783
I paid you half upfront.
I gave you everything that you asked for.

31:25.873 --> 31:28.068
Now it's time for you to show me.

31:30.673 --> 31:32.903
This is your test subject.

31:37.993 --> 31:40.268
No problem.

31:40.353 --> 31:42.344
We can do it right now if you'd like.

31:42.433 --> 31:46.187
No, I wanna do it in the field.
I wanna know for sure.

31:46.273 --> 31:48.264
Well, you're the boss.

31:48.353 --> 31:51.390
How does tomorrow sound?

31:52.113 --> 31:56.470
Assuming it all goes according to plan, how
soon can you ramp up pathogen production?

31:56.553 --> 32:01.627
Well, I can manufacture enough to blanket
the entire western seaboard by Friday.

32:01.713 --> 32:03.988
How you disperse it is, of course, up to you.

32:04.073 --> 32:08.669
These are good for small areas, but they're
expensive and very hard to get ahold of.

32:08.753 --> 32:11.904
- We'll use helicopters.
- Well, that sounds like a plan.

32:12.193 --> 32:16.505
By the weekend, there won't be a transgenic
left alive from here to San Diego.

32:16.593 --> 32:20.745
Good. Maybe I'll play
a round of golf on Sunday.

32:30.193 --> 32:34.072
Matt, I think I may have a lead. It said
in the police reports that, both times,

32:34.153 --> 32:38.305
when the boy died and at the bus station,
people thought they heard fireworks.

32:38.393 --> 32:40.827
- Yeah? So it's Chinatown.
- No, listen.

32:41.233 --> 32:44.350
There's a type of bio-agent
dispersion cartridge.

32:45.353 --> 32:49.983
It's fired from a hand-held launcher,
triggered by an altimeter.

32:50.073 --> 32:54.510
According to my source, a buyer just shelled
out for three of them, 20 grand apiece.

32:54.593 --> 32:56.823
Took delivery last week.

32:56.913 --> 32:59.985
- Tell me you got an address.
- Have I ever let you down?

33:25.753 --> 33:30.031
- Three steps are gonna be involved here.
- Why am I not surprised?

33:30.113 --> 33:33.992
Step one. We take the test subject
into the target area. We release him.

33:34.073 --> 33:36.109
Step two.

33:36.193 --> 33:39.105
We use this to disperse the pathogen.

33:39.193 --> 33:42.344
There's enough to kill
any transgenic in a two-mile radius.

33:42.433 --> 33:44.583
That's ample to cover Sector Four.

33:44.673 --> 33:47.949
- What if he escapes the kill zone?
- No, that would be impossible.

33:48.033 --> 33:52.106
It takes a minute for the plume to hit
ground level and four minutes to dissipate.

33:52.193 --> 33:55.105
There's no way on earth
he could make it out alive.

33:55.193 --> 33:57.661
Step three.

33:57.753 --> 34:00.586
We track him and we retrieve the body.

34:00.673 --> 34:02.664
I have a correction to step three.

34:02.953 --> 34:05.342
You track him and retrieve the body.

34:05.433 --> 34:08.630
I'm staying away from here
until this is done.

34:10.273 --> 34:13.344
What if you messed up
and got a couple of base pairs wrong?

34:13.433 --> 34:16.231
We could end up
with a sector full of dead people.

34:16.873 --> 34:20.502
- You don't trust me?
- Make a believer out of me, Cyril.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.663
You'll get the rest of your money.

34:23.672 --> 34:25.664
You have a nice day, now.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.864
Matt.

34:48.193 --> 34:50.184
What is it?

34:50.273 --> 34:52.342
Max, it's me. We got a problem.

35:14.873 --> 35:17.068
You're free to go.

35:23.593 --> 35:25.743
You can run but you can't hide.

35:32.873 --> 35:35.706
What the hell are the cops doin' here?

35:35.793 --> 35:37.511
Son of a bitch.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.584
Drive.

35:43.153 --> 35:43.273
Units three and four, move into position.

35:43.273 --> 35:45.741
Units three and four, move into position.

35:49.153 --> 35:51.713
They're gonna test the pathogen on an X5.

35:51.793 --> 35:55.229
He busted out of a van on Mercer,
took off down 11.

35:59.473 --> 36:02.545
- I gotta get him out.
- In a minute, it'll hit ground level.

36:02.633 --> 36:05.545
The sector will be toxic
for four minutes after that.

36:05.633 --> 36:08.067
- I'm going in.
- Max!

36:08.233 --> 36:10.428
Jam Pony messenger comin' through.

36:11.033 --> 36:13.627
- Max! Max!
- Hold up. Passes only.

36:50.993 --> 36:52.392
No, wait!

38:34.033 --> 38:35.307
Lady.

38:35.793 --> 38:40.913
I have no idea who you are,
but you just cost me five million dollars.

39:01.713 --> 39:06.548
Thanks for letting him stay the night.
He's had a rough couple of days.

39:06.633 --> 39:10.342
Logan's gonna help me
get him over the border tomorrow.

39:10.433 --> 39:13.869
Killing us all, that was the plan.

39:14.513 --> 39:18.472
It still is. We just got lucky this time.

39:21.673 --> 39:23.868
See you first thing in the morning.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.389
You lay low, little fella.

39:30.433 --> 39:32.663
You too, big fella.

39:41.233 --> 39:44.782
Convinced Sung to let me hang on
to everything we found in the guy's lab.

39:44.873 --> 39:48.627
Didn't want whoever hired him
to get their hands on it again.

39:48.713 --> 39:51.591
- He's a good guy, Sung.
- Yeah, he is.

39:51.673 --> 39:55.825
He's got a lot of questions.
Not sure what I'm gonna tell him.

39:55.913 --> 39:58.711
As little as possible
is usually a good idea.

39:59.913 --> 40:02.507
I'll do my best.

40:03.033 --> 40:06.264
Did I mention I was sorry
for jumping to conclusions?

40:07.593 --> 40:09.584
Yeah.

40:12.353 --> 40:17.632
- Anything turn up on Sandeman's cane?
- Nothing but traces of Rodentia calcium.

40:17.713 --> 40:19.988
The rats tried to eat it.

40:20.073 --> 40:22.712
- Another dead end.
- Yeah.

40:26.113 --> 40:28.263
Listen, about the other night at Crash.

40:28.353 --> 40:30.583
Didn't know you were gonna be there.

40:31.313 --> 40:33.588
Same with me.

40:34.153 --> 40:36.713
I just needed to get out.

40:38.193 --> 40:40.104
I know the feeling.
