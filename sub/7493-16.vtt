WEBVTT

00:05.458 --> 00:07.041
I'm proud of us.

00:07.125 --> 00:09.291
Raising money
for the Seaford Club for Boys

00:09.375 --> 00:10.750
shows that we have maturity.

00:10.834 --> 00:12.500
- And we are classy.
- Yeah.

00:12.583 --> 00:15.250
- How much we got in the fart jar?
- Yeah!

00:15.291 --> 00:17.291
Whoo! We made a lot of money
by making people

00:17.417 --> 00:19.500
put a dollar in the jar
every time they ripped one.

00:20.792 --> 00:21.959
Wait, what?

00:22.041 --> 00:24.542
I've been paying a dollar
to fart in the jar.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.917
- Ah!
- Oh, my eyes are burning!

00:31.750 --> 00:32.792
Guys?

00:33.709 --> 00:35.333
I've got big news.

00:35.417 --> 00:37.041
Your mother started dressing you again?

00:38.750 --> 00:39.792
Yes.

00:40.917 --> 00:43.792
And I'm buying a boat!

00:43.875 --> 00:44.959
Boom!

00:45.041 --> 00:47.000
Picture us out on the boat

00:47.083 --> 00:49.834
going over the waves, up and down,

00:49.917 --> 00:52.667
up and down, up and down,

00:52.750 --> 00:55.291
up and...

00:55.834 --> 00:58.041
Why did you take me out
on such a windy day?

00:59.291 --> 01:02.250
All I need is another 1,000 bucks
and it's mine!

01:02.291 --> 01:05.709
Guys, I just counted it. We have $1,100.

01:05.792 --> 01:07.000
Ooh, thank you.

01:08.583 --> 01:09.917
Hey!

01:10.000 --> 01:12.250
We promised that money
to the Seaford Club for Boys.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.500
It's an after-school hang-out
for troubled kids.

01:14.583 --> 01:17.458
Yeah, we're buying them all-new furniture
for their rec room. They don't have any.

01:17.542 --> 01:19.667
You guys need $1,000 for furniture?

01:19.750 --> 01:21.500
For a hundred dollars,

01:21.583 --> 01:23.417
I can get you some beautiful stuff.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.500
My cousin owns the largest
Hachmachistan furniture store

01:26.583 --> 01:28.417
in all of California.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.250
Wait, your cousin is Furniture Frank?

01:31.291 --> 01:34.583
Oh, I love his commercials!
That guy's crazy.

01:35.959 --> 01:40.125
People tell me that my prices
are so low that I'm crazy!

01:40.208 --> 01:42.291
But if I was crazy,

01:42.375 --> 01:43.959
would I do this?

01:47.875 --> 01:50.208
I'm eating my beard!

01:53.250 --> 01:55.959
Eating his beard like that
helps him sell furniture?

01:56.041 --> 01:57.417
Oh, no, he's actually crazy.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.458
Well, this is perfect.

02:00.542 --> 02:03.291
The delinquents get their furniture
and I get my boat.

02:13.542 --> 02:17.291
- Uh, Joan, that's a $100 bill.
- Yeah, do you need change for that?

02:17.375 --> 02:18.417
No.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.125
Just did some crop dustin'.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.166
What's crop dust...

02:26.250 --> 02:28.917
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, whoa!

02:29.000 --> 02:30.834

03:10.041 --> 03:12.667
I was this close

03:12.750 --> 03:16.291
to landing in a club
for delinquent boys myself.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.709
Really? What'd you do?

03:18.792 --> 03:22.709
I walked my dog
and I didn't pick up after him.

03:24.208 --> 03:25.542
I felt so guilty

03:25.625 --> 03:28.709
I went back the next day,
but it was too late.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.458
There was already a footprint in it.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.875
And it was the footprint of a baby!

03:41.291 --> 03:43.917
Guys, it was an honor
to donate this furniture.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.041
See, we would've come last Tuesday
when it was delivered,

03:46.125 --> 03:47.625
but we were on a boat, tubin'.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.125
For charity.

03:50.875 --> 03:54.500
Uh, see, there's this group called, uh...

03:54.583 --> 03:57.500
- Tubing for Tots.
- Tots.

03:57.583 --> 03:59.875
Yeah, we tube for tots
that can't tube for themselves.

03:59.959 --> 04:00.792
Mm.

04:01.417 --> 04:03.959
Uh, I'd like to say a few words.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.000
Although this is a club
for delinquent boys,

04:08.083 --> 04:10.125
let our selfless generosity

04:10.208 --> 04:13.083
be a beacon of light in your empty lives.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.875
Dude, our lives aren't empty.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.792
See, already making a difference.

04:20.792 --> 04:21.917
Buh-bye.

04:22.875 --> 04:25.000
- Oh!
-

04:25.083 --> 04:28.375
Dude! Look what you did
to our beautiful chair, man.

04:28.458 --> 04:29.458
You broke it!

04:29.542 --> 04:34.000
That thing cost us, like, 20...
hundred bucks.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.667
I didn't do anything, man.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.750
This thing's got termites
crawling out of it.

04:37.834 --> 04:38.875
Oh, boo-hoo.

04:38.959 --> 04:41.667
One chair out of all the furniture
we gave you has termites.

04:41.750 --> 04:42.834
- Oh!
-

04:49.000 --> 04:50.792
Oh, boo-hoo,
every single piece of furniture

04:50.875 --> 04:52.125
we gave you has termites.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.417
Guys, we have got to hurry.
Let's get this furniture out of here

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
before the termites
spread to the rest of the house.

04:58.583 --> 05:01.667
Oh, relax,
that's never going to happen, Jack.

05:05.917 --> 05:08.917
Out of my way!
Senseis and boat owners first!

05:16.333 --> 05:19.583
Rudy, dude, we got the estimate
to repair the Boys' Club.

05:21.083 --> 05:24.291
-
- And here's the bill to fumigate.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.709
Oh. This one should be a little better.

05:26.792 --> 05:30.458
I mean, how much can it cost
to kill a couple of bu...

05:31.625 --> 05:34.625
Kill a couple of bu...

05:35.583 --> 05:37.750
- Rudy, it's gonna be all right.
- No, it's not, man.

05:37.834 --> 05:39.792
It's gonna take us years
to raise this kind of money.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.000
Well, we don't have years.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.959
If the money's not in place
by midnight tomorrow,

05:43.041 --> 05:45.500
the city's going to condemn the building
and auction off the property.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.417
Oh, problem solved. Thank you, city.

05:49.125 --> 05:50.166
Rudy!

05:50.500 --> 05:52.375
Well, I'm sure
it's going to work out for 'em.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.959
There's thousands of places
for them to go after school.

05:55.041 --> 05:58.417
Sorry, guys, there's absolutely no place
for them to go after school.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.250
You don't bring delinquents
into your home.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.583
- You can't trust 'em.
- Well...

06:06.583 --> 06:08.417
Shoo! Shoo!

06:08.500 --> 06:10.792
Rudy, Rudy, you can't do that, man.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.166
You're right.
They might try to steal the broom.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.291
Rudy, I think you're overreacting.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.917
No, I am not!

06:18.000 --> 06:20.458
I remember the delinquent from my school.
Don't ask me how,

06:20.542 --> 06:22.291
but he was always
running around the school

06:22.375 --> 06:24.417
blowing up toilets.
You couldn't trust him.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.291
Oh, yeah,
and you think these kids are like him?

06:31.875 --> 06:33.917
Yes. Yes, I do.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.667
We've gotta get these kids out of here.
They're gonna destroy this place.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.166
Well, if we don't raise the money
to fix their club,

06:38.250 --> 06:39.750
they're gonna be here all the time.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.125
How are we gonna raise $13,000?

06:42.208 --> 06:43.834
What are we gonna do?
We gonna do a bake sale?

06:43.917 --> 06:46.041
A carwash? Telethon?

06:46.125 --> 06:47.750
Ooh, actually, a telethon could work.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.875
Yeah, we could air it on public-access TV.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.959
I can't think with all your yapping!

06:52.041 --> 06:55.125
I could get rock star Izzy Gunnar
and some of his famous friends to perform.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.917
Aw, that would get people to donate!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.542
And then we'll get all the money we need!

06:58.625 --> 07:01.375
I've got it! We're having a telethon.

07:04.041 --> 07:06.709
Let's work fast, everybody.
We're down to one stall!

07:06.792 --> 07:07.959
Go!

Ah.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.709
Look at this.

07:29.166 --> 07:30.834
Maybe it wasn't them.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.375
Hey, Phil, have you been
putting worms in your hot dogs?

07:34.041 --> 07:35.000
Of course not.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.083
You know how expensive worms are?

07:37.166 --> 07:39.166
Okay, maybe it was them.

Look, bro, the only reason
why they're messing with you

07:41.917 --> 07:43.750
is because you expect
the worst out of them.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.417

10:56.417 --> 10:58.709
We're going to rally together
and get through this.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.083
We don't need celebrities.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.458
We've got tons of talent
right here in our own backyard.

and now we have...

12:42.834 --> 12:43.959
Eight?

12:44.041 --> 12:46.375
How did we lose seven dollars?

12:47.083 --> 12:49.875
A guy named Gary called.
He wanted his money back.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.417
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

12:54.500 --> 12:55.500
- Hup!
- Ha!

12:55.583 --> 12:56.583
- Hup!
- Yah!

12:56.667 --> 12:57.750
- Hup!
- Ha!

12:57.834 --> 13:00.291
All right, guys. Great job.
Keep up the work.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.583
Uh, dude, why do you have
two bowling balls?

13:04.667 --> 13:07.542
Oh, I glued this one to my other hand
to balance me out.

13:07.625 --> 13:09.917
You know, without it,
I just kept walking in circles.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.875
Yo, you're actually doing
karate with these monsters?

13:14.959 --> 13:16.458
Dude, they're not monsters.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.000
I saw something in them
that you didn't see.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.917
If you channel their energy
in a constructive way,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.709
they're too preoccupied
to get into trouble.

13:22.792 --> 13:25.041
They're actually really great kids.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.834
Sorry about the bowling ball.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.041
If we just found a way
to channel our energy

13:31.125 --> 13:32.709
in a constructive way,

13:32.792 --> 13:34.583
we'd be too preoccupied
to get into trouble.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.959
- Yeah, we're actually great kids.
- Yeah.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.333
Hey, guys, let's hit this rock wall
you wanted to try.

13:43.125 --> 13:44.000
So it's really simple.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.875
You just got to pick a grip
and climb your way up.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.625
<i>Okay.</i>

13:53.291 --> 13:55.458
Now it gets a little trickier
once you get near the top

13:55.542 --> 13:56.542
because... Whoa!

13:58.542 --> 14:00.208
That doesn't usually happen.

14:00.291 --> 14:01.375
Whoa!

14:02.834 --> 14:04.500
You guys loosened the grips, didn't you?

14:04.583 --> 14:06.417
Uh-huh.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.625
- So that means that I'm gonna--
- Uh-huh.

14:09.709 --> 14:10.959
Whoa!

14:14.709 --> 14:15.917
Get back! Get back.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.959
I'm never letting you guys
mess with me again.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.083
Dude, hold that thought.

14:20.166 --> 14:23.375
You've got a giant mosquito
on your forehead.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.542
Wait, what? Where?

14:29.083 --> 14:30.333
Did I get it?

14:36.333 --> 14:40.583
We have 37 minutes
and we've only raised $16.

14:40.917 --> 14:44.417
And that was from a guy
who called begging us to end the telethon.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.667
We can still pull this together.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.000
Sure we can, yeah.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.291
Yeah, I don't know.
Why don't we just have Phil

14:51.375 --> 14:52.792
stick his hand up some dumb doll

14:52.875 --> 14:54.750
and try to pass himself off
as a ventriloquist?

14:55.750 --> 14:57.542
Oh, hello, Herbert.

15:00.917 --> 15:04.041
Why don't you tell these nice people
something about yourself?

15:04.125 --> 15:05.125
No!

15:05.709 --> 15:08.917
Come on, Herbert.
You promised to be nice today.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.959
And you promised to stop dancing
in front of me in your underpants.

15:14.583 --> 15:17.500
Hey, Herbert, come on, man.
That was only one time.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.083
One time was all it took.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.792
Now every time I close my eyes,

15:20.875 --> 15:22.500
I see it all over again.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.792
Ah! Ah! Ah!

15:24.875 --> 15:25.792
Okay, stop it.

15:25.875 --> 15:26.792
No, you stop it.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.792
Now you better stop... Ow! He bit me.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.625
There's more where that came from!

15:30.709 --> 15:33.583
Oh, no!

15:33.667 --> 15:36.500
No, no, no!

15:38.959 --> 15:42.041
Dummies.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.166
Run into the dojo,
have Jack put on a show gi.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.750
He can come over here,
do one of those karate demos to music.

15:48.834 --> 15:50.000
People love that stuff.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.750
Or I could put on my star-spangled outfit

15:52.834 --> 15:54.834
and do a high-spirited,
patriotic tap routine

15:54.917 --> 15:56.417
that will bring down the house.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.834
- Ah, I didn't think of that.
- Huh?

15:58.959 --> 16:00.667
Go get Jack!

16:04.792 --> 16:07.625
And now another hilarious joke

16:08.375 --> 16:09.709
from these Popsicles.

16:14.792 --> 16:18.166
What do you call...

16:18.542 --> 16:21.542
two...

16:21.625 --> 16:24.041
...witches who live together?

16:24.875 --> 16:28.166
I guess I'll just eat it
to get to the punch line.

16:34.625 --> 16:39.125
"Broom..."

16:39.667 --> 16:42.125
Sorry, folks. Another brain freeze.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.500
"Broommates"!

16:52.875 --> 16:54.000
Nothin'?

16:54.583 --> 16:55.625
Really?

16:58.458 --> 17:00.166
Rudy, I brought Jack.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.375
Great, where is he?

17:04.667 --> 17:05.959
What happened?

17:06.041 --> 17:07.625
Walt and Jesse are what happened.

17:07.709 --> 17:09.333
They've been terrorizing us all day.

17:09.834 --> 17:13.125
Rudy, there's only one thing we can do.

17:16.667 --> 17:17.709
Tap!

17:34.000 --> 17:36.500
I don't believe it. We're making money!

17:54.458 --> 17:56.166
What is wrong with you two?

17:56.250 --> 17:58.166
We're trying to save your club.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.750
No, you're not.
We heard what you said in the dojo.

18:00.834 --> 18:02.750
The only reason why you're trying
to save the club

18:02.834 --> 18:04.291
is to get rid of us "delinquents."

18:04.417 --> 18:06.667
Yeah, you don't even care about us.

18:08.291 --> 18:09.750
How dare you?

18:09.834 --> 18:12.834
- I farted in a jar for you!
-

18:14.166 --> 18:15.917
Yeah, and we gave you furniture.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.709
Cheap furniture full of termites.

18:17.792 --> 18:21.625
Well, we needed the extra money
for the boat.

18:22.291 --> 18:23.750
We thought you were different.

18:23.834 --> 18:27.750
I mean, you're a sensei.
You care about these guys.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.417
We thought you'd care about us too.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.792
But you're just like everybody else.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.875
Hey, everyone, can I have your attention?

18:49.583 --> 18:51.750
The whole reason
we're holding this telethon

18:51.834 --> 18:54.750
is to save the Seaford Club for Boys.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.834
And two of those boys are with us tonight.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.041
Are they bad kids?

18:59.875 --> 19:01.041
Oh, yeah, they're bad.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.500
- The worst! These kids are like--
- Rudy.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.625
But it doesn't matter.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.583
We made a commitment.

19:10.208 --> 19:12.125
And when you set out to do
something good for someone,

19:12.208 --> 19:13.542
you do it, you follow through.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.375
And you don't buy yourself a really
nice boat just to get ladies.

19:18.208 --> 19:21.333
And that's why anyone
who donates $10 right now

19:21.417 --> 19:24.041
will be entered in a raffle
to win this boat.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.792
It floats in water!

19:32.333 --> 19:33.291
Hello?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.250
Oh, that's great news, ma'am.
Thank you so much.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.083
Oh, just one second,
I'm going to put you on hold.

19:43.542 --> 19:45.000
I think she hung up.

19:48.417 --> 19:50.250
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

19:51.125 --> 19:53.917
All the new stuff they gave us
is really cool.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.041
But do you think
they'll ever let us use it?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.959
Oh, I love this place.
Do we ever have to leave?

19:59.041 --> 20:00.291
I don't see why.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.875
Oh, if I knew how awesome
this place was going to be,

20:02.959 --> 20:05.083
I totally would have been a delinquent.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.250
In fact, I'm going to start right now.

20:08.417 --> 20:12.375
Ooh! Ah! Check it out, people.

20:12.458 --> 20:14.458
No coaster! Ha!

20:23.458 --> 20:26.250
Oh, who am I kidding?
I don't want to leave a ring!

20:27.959 --> 20:30.375
Hey, guys, thanks for everything you did.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.500
This is really great.

20:32.834 --> 20:33.959
We talked about it.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.458
This isn't just a once-a-year thing.

20:36.542 --> 20:38.709
You guys are welcome at the dojo anytime.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.917
We're sorry we caused so much trouble.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.959
Well, we kind of deserved it.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.625
But we're all even, right?

20:48.625 --> 20:51.291
Ha ha! Now we're even!

20:59.000 --> 21:02.834
I'm really glad you called
after seeing me on the telethon.

21:02.917 --> 21:05.458
You are cute as a button.

21:06.792 --> 21:09.792
And you are as cute as a kitten.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.750
Oh!

21:11.834 --> 21:13.291
Meow!

21:16.834 --> 21:19.250
Okay, I'm starting to feel
really uncomfortable.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.875
I don't want to do this anymore.

21:22.041 --> 21:24.458
Listen, you better get
back down there now.

21:24.542 --> 21:25.667
Do what he says!

21:28.583 --> 21:30.417
Now where were we?

21:56.875 --> 21:57.750
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.875 --> 22:02.834
<i>Yes!</i>
