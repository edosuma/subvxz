00:01.250 --> 00:04.638
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Uriel didn't just die.

00:04.640 --> 00:06.733
I killed him.

00:06.735 --> 00:08.275
Where's Uriel?

00:08.277 --> 00:09.576
Oh.

00:09.578 --> 00:11.835
You look really familiar. Have we met?

00:11.837 --> 00:14.550
35 years ago, Father
asked me to come down here

00:14.552 --> 00:16.583
to bless a couple who was
unable to have a child.

00:16.585 --> 00:18.352
God put her in Lucifer's path.

00:18.354 --> 00:19.653
Why are you so upset?

00:19.655 --> 00:21.903
Because I just don't know if it's real.

00:21.905 --> 00:24.058
Why is it that sometimes I'm immortal,

00:24.060 --> 00:26.475
and other times I'm all too human?

00:26.477 --> 00:28.202
Appears you make me vulnerable.

00:28.204 --> 00:30.831
What's in that package is
far more valuable than drugs.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.232
You're a bad man.

00:32.234 --> 00:34.435
Dr. Jason Carlisle. He
saved the dissertation

00:34.437 --> 00:36.970
while an innocent college student died.

00:39.475 --> 00:40.813
Freeze!

00:40.815 --> 00:43.350
We are talking designer poison, here.

00:43.352 --> 00:44.611
So, how do we get an antidote?

00:44.613 --> 00:46.365
Well, that right there
is the tricky part.

00:46.367 --> 00:48.724
Designer poisons need
designer antidotes.

00:48.726 --> 00:49.892
Detective!

00:51.187 --> 00:54.040
It won't stop.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.899 --> 01:06.266
Lucifer.

01:06.268 --> 01:09.036
The bleeding stopped. You don't
have to drive like a maniac.

01:09.038 --> 01:10.738
You've forgotten you've
been poisoned, Detective,

01:10.740 --> 01:12.072
or has it already reached your brain?

01:12.074 --> 01:14.508
Maybe it's just a
nosebleed. I mean, I-I...

01:14.510 --> 01:16.590
How could the professor
have injected me?

01:16.615 --> 01:18.145
I didn't get one of his flu shots.

01:18.147 --> 01:19.413
What about when you went after him?

01:19.415 --> 01:20.914
Well, I don't know.

01:20.916 --> 01:24.551
I tackled him to the ground,
we-we struggled for a bit,

01:24.553 --> 01:27.154
and, God, I guess if
he injected me somehow,

01:27.156 --> 01:29.223
it would have to be just...

01:30.327 --> 01:32.160
- Ugh.
- Oh, God.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.428
Everything's gonna be fine
once we get to the hospital.

01:34.430 --> 01:36.463
Okay?

01:36.465 --> 01:39.500
We can't go to the hospital.

01:39.502 --> 01:41.735
- What?
- Lucifer, going to the hospital

01:41.737 --> 01:44.438
didn't help any of the other victims.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.007
The only thing that's gonna save my life

01:47.009 --> 01:48.509
is finding the antidote.

01:49.606 --> 01:52.279
Otherwise, I'm...

01:52.281 --> 01:55.449
All right. All right, very well.

02:03.392 --> 02:05.526
No judgments, guys, okay?

02:05.528 --> 02:08.196
You said come right away,
so I came right away.

02:08.221 --> 02:10.531
You're lucky I remembered
to put on pants...

02:10.532 --> 02:12.432
eventually. So, what's up?

02:12.434 --> 02:14.368
- Well, um...
- Well, we're worried

02:14.370 --> 02:17.237
that someone else, um, out
there might be poisoned.

02:17.239 --> 02:18.539
Oh, I doubt it.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.874
I asked every hospital in
the area to report anything

02:20.876 --> 02:23.076
even resembling a poisoning.

02:23.078 --> 02:24.378
So far, haven't heard a peep.

02:24.380 --> 02:27.247
Well, just to be sure,
let's, uh, let's go over

02:27.249 --> 02:29.049
what you found at the
professor's lab, okay?

02:29.051 --> 02:30.417
Check it out.

02:30.419 --> 02:31.485
Uh, Detective.

02:31.487 --> 02:33.066
We should tell her.

02:33.091 --> 02:34.657
No, we can't.

02:34.682 --> 02:36.990
She'll freak out. It'll get in
the way of the investigation.

02:36.992 --> 02:38.425
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

02:38.427 --> 02:40.227
Are you guys done having
your whisper fight?

02:40.229 --> 02:44.331
Uh, just make out already
and get it over with. Yeesh.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.500
So... I did find

02:46.502 --> 02:48.202
this syringe on the scene.

02:48.204 --> 02:51.839
It had a tiny bit of poison
left in it, so, yeah, in theory,

02:51.841 --> 02:53.207
someone out there may have been dosed.

02:53.209 --> 02:55.742
- Hmm.
- Okay, but the other poisons

02:55.767 --> 02:57.665
had corresponding antidotes, yeah?

02:57.690 --> 02:59.613
Did you find anything to match this one?

02:59.615 --> 03:01.014
I did.

03:02.685 --> 03:06.053
Problem is, dude destroyed
whatever was inside.

03:06.055 --> 03:08.388
Dick move, right?

03:08.390 --> 03:10.224
I mean, that's why I'm glad no
one's reported to any hospitals,

03:10.226 --> 03:11.491
'cause without the antidote,

03:11.493 --> 03:14.027
ugh, they'd end up just
like the other victims.

03:14.029 --> 03:16.930
You know, first a bloody nose and then

03:16.932 --> 03:19.733
- fainting spells, followed by seizures...
- We get the point.

03:19.735 --> 03:22.436
...and then their guts
slowly start boiling,

03:22.438 --> 03:23.837
like, literally boiling.

03:23.839 --> 03:26.006
It's so gross and nasty,
and 24 hours later...

03:26.008 --> 03:28.675
- bam, just like that, dead as a doornail.
- Got it. Thank you. Yes.

03:28.677 --> 03:30.410
- You've painting quite the picture,
Miss Lopez. - Right.

03:30.412 --> 03:32.646
Yeah, let's go over everything else

03:32.648 --> 03:34.724
- from the professor's lab. Okay?
- Mm.

03:34.749 --> 03:36.283
Just to see if we've missed anything.

03:36.285 --> 03:37.885
Okay? Sure.

03:38.954 --> 03:42.055
Okay. So...

03:42.057 --> 03:43.123
Here we go.

03:46.996 --> 03:48.762
I got your text. What's so urgent?

03:48.764 --> 03:50.998
Uh... this way.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.399
Somewhere we can speak in private.

04:02.811 --> 04:04.678
Was this part of Father's plan?

04:04.680 --> 04:05.913
Hmm?

04:05.915 --> 04:06.914
Answer me, brother,

04:06.916 --> 04:08.115
before I rip your spine out

04:08.117 --> 04:10.317
- and beat you to death with it.
- What are you talking about?

04:10.319 --> 04:12.953
How long...

04:12.955 --> 04:14.955
how long have you been manipulating me?

04:14.957 --> 04:16.523
Mom told you about Chloe?

04:16.524 --> 04:17.925
Oh, that she did.

04:17.927 --> 04:20.928
And that you put the
detective in my path.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.696
No, I didn't.

04:22.698 --> 04:24.731
Father did.

04:26.068 --> 04:28.302
I was just another pawn in His game.

04:28.304 --> 04:29.636
I had no idea.

04:29.638 --> 04:31.238
And the detective?

04:31.240 --> 04:36.076
Is she simply another
pawn as well or is she...

04:36.078 --> 04:37.110
Is she?

04:37.112 --> 04:39.346
She doesn't know anything.

04:49.291 --> 04:50.457
Listen.

04:50.459 --> 04:53.327
Luci, we've been played like puppets.

04:53.329 --> 04:56.229
Father has manipulated us both.

04:56.231 --> 04:59.066
Don't you dare compare our situations.

04:59.068 --> 05:04.538
All that I have ever wanted
to do for all of my existence

05:04.540 --> 05:05.939
was make Father proud.

05:07.209 --> 05:10.343
I thought I was doing
great works in His name.

05:10.368 --> 05:13.113
Instead, the very first of His angels

05:13.115 --> 05:15.749
was busy making you a little girlfriend.

05:15.751 --> 05:19.152
Oh. Well, my heart bleeds for you.

05:19.154 --> 05:21.050
We're on the same side here, brother.

05:21.075 --> 05:22.141
Are we?

05:23.592 --> 05:26.259
Then be honest with me, brother.

05:26.261 --> 05:28.528
How deep does Father's plan go?

05:28.530 --> 05:31.531
Is the detective's poisoning part of it?

05:31.533 --> 05:34.568
Poisoning?

05:34.570 --> 05:36.203
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:37.172 --> 05:38.305
You really don't know?

05:38.307 --> 05:39.840
No.

05:39.842 --> 05:42.009
Then you...

05:43.979 --> 05:46.046
...you can't help her.

05:50.085 --> 05:51.985
I'm sorry.

05:54.890 --> 05:57.624
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

05:57.626 --> 05:59.359
Amenadiel.

05:59.361 --> 06:00.794
Give us a minute.

06:00.796 --> 06:03.630
I... have an idea.
I need to talk to you.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.569
Okay, so the professor's
been using this Burt guy

06:09.571 --> 06:11.371
to smuggle in the poisons.

06:11.373 --> 06:12.506
What, so you think that Burt

06:12.531 --> 06:14.193
might have smuggled
the antidotes as well?

06:14.195 --> 06:15.675
- Yes.
- All right.

06:15.677 --> 06:16.843
Point me to his prison cell.

06:16.845 --> 06:19.179
Perhaps some toilet
wine waterboarding or...

06:19.181 --> 06:20.514
Well, he's already out on bail,

06:20.516 --> 06:22.482
but the good news is, he
does have an ankle bracelet

06:22.484 --> 06:24.484
so he can't get far.

06:26.455 --> 06:27.754
Detective.

06:28.724 --> 06:31.324
I'm fine. We should go.

06:43.205 --> 06:45.672
They think they can keep me down.

06:45.674 --> 06:46.873
Me!

06:46.875 --> 06:48.975
Well, screw them!

06:48.977 --> 06:51.278
I'll party every night until the trial,

06:51.280 --> 06:53.880
and then every day once I'm found...

06:53.882 --> 06:56.416
Innocent!

07:10.599 --> 07:13.433
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

07:13.435 --> 07:16.670
No. No, you can bump into me anytime.

07:18.173 --> 07:19.606
Have we met before?

07:20.676 --> 07:22.442
Weren't you at that beach party?

07:22.444 --> 07:25.178
Yeah. Yeah, I wa... I-I'm stalking you.

07:27.182 --> 07:28.748
So, why don't you show me the bedroom?

07:28.750 --> 07:30.984
You read my mind.

07:31.887 --> 07:33.520
So...

07:33.522 --> 07:35.622
oh.

07:35.624 --> 07:37.124
Uh.

07:37.126 --> 07:38.692
Y-You okay?

07:38.694 --> 07:42.629
Oh... um...

07:42.631 --> 07:44.030
Yeah, yeah.

07:44.032 --> 07:45.765
No, no, I'm fine.

07:45.767 --> 07:47.312
I'm fine. What were you saying?

07:47.337 --> 07:50.547
Uh... yeah. Yeah, maybe another time.

07:50.572 --> 07:53.573
No, that doesn't really work for me.

08:07.489 --> 08:08.881
Hey, what the hell is this?

08:08.906 --> 08:10.372
Hello, Burtrude.

08:17.833 --> 08:20.000
Remember me?

08:24.406 --> 08:26.439
You didn't hurt him, did you?

08:26.441 --> 08:28.375
Physically, no, as I promised.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.343
- Too bad.
- I did get him to talk,

08:30.345 --> 08:32.511
but he didn't smuggle the antidote.

08:32.514 --> 08:33.847
What? You sure?

08:33.849 --> 08:36.116
Unfortunately, yes, but he
did provide me with a lead.

08:36.118 --> 08:37.851
The professor hired Burt
through some middleman,

08:37.852 --> 08:39.219
a chap named Dave Maddox.

08:39.221 --> 08:40.486
There's a good chance

08:40.489 --> 08:42.155
the professor got the
antidotes from him.

08:42.157 --> 08:43.456
Oh.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.025
- Detective?
- Oh, sorry.

08:45.027 --> 08:46.793
- Wait.
- You okay?

08:46.795 --> 08:49.296
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

08:49.298 --> 08:51.064
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:51.066 --> 08:52.491
Detective!

08:58.240 --> 08:59.773
Detective!

08:59.775 --> 09:05.793

09:12.625 --> 09:14.125
What the hell were you thinking?

09:14.127 --> 09:15.560
I thought I was being quite responsible

09:15.562 --> 09:17.095
bringing her directly to the hospital.

09:17.097 --> 09:18.463
You mean after the two of you

09:18.465 --> 09:20.298
- went off and interrogated a felon
on bail? - Well, of course.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.200
It was much easier to
get her here unconscious.

09:22.202 --> 09:23.601
You know how stubborn she can get.

09:23.603 --> 09:24.869
It doesn't change the fact that...

09:24.871 --> 09:26.971
You guys know that I'm right here, yeah?

09:28.441 --> 09:30.007
Hey.

09:30.009 --> 09:31.509
Hey.

09:31.511 --> 09:32.844
How you feeling?

09:32.846 --> 09:35.747
Fine.

09:36.174 --> 09:38.541
Lucifer, I told you no hospitals.

09:38.543 --> 09:40.309
How am I supposed to find the antidote

09:40.311 --> 09:42.278
if I'm laying here... ow.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.480
Shh.

09:46.184 --> 09:47.783
We'll take it from here.

09:47.785 --> 09:49.885
Yes. Yes, we will.

09:49.887 --> 09:52.154
And we'll start by
following up on your lead.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.856
Dave Maddox. Yes.

09:53.858 --> 09:54.890
Thank you.

09:56.227 --> 09:57.893
Is Trixie here?

09:57.895 --> 10:00.129
She should be any minute.

10:00.131 --> 10:01.263
I'll go check.

10:05.995 --> 10:08.162
I don't want Trixie to get
scared seeing me like this.

10:08.164 --> 10:09.263
Do I look okay?

10:09.265 --> 10:14.268
You... you look heaven-sent.

10:27.650 --> 10:31.185
Just... follow my lead and don't
do anything unless I say, okay?

10:31.187 --> 10:32.586
If that's what it takes,

10:32.588 --> 10:34.121
then you have my word.

10:34.123 --> 10:36.790
Dearie me, these are atrocious.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.526
What self-respecting artist
would actually display these?

10:39.528 --> 10:41.261
Dave Maddox isn't a real artist.

10:41.263 --> 10:42.396
To say the least.

10:42.398 --> 10:44.164
All this is just a front.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.466
See, criminals like Maddox,

10:45.468 --> 10:47.601
they use art sales to
cover up money transfers.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.969
They could demand

10:48.971 --> 10:50.604
any price for a piece of art,

10:50.606 --> 10:53.307
and in return provide whatever
it is their clients really want.

10:53.309 --> 10:56.410
Can he provide an eye bath?
I'll need one after this.

10:56.412 --> 10:58.112
There he is.

10:59.248 --> 11:00.781
Remember what I said.

11:00.783 --> 11:02.916
My word is my bond.

11:05.154 --> 11:07.521
Dave Maddox?

11:07.523 --> 11:08.589
We need to talk.

11:08.591 --> 11:10.057
Just one moment, all right?

11:10.059 --> 11:10.991
No, it's urgent.

11:10.993 --> 11:12.659
It's about your other business.

11:12.661 --> 11:14.394
Specifically, with
Professor Jason Carlisle.

11:14.396 --> 11:15.996
Help us get the professor's antidote,

11:15.998 --> 11:18.532
and we'll get out of your
children's art festival.

11:19.502 --> 11:21.335
Can you just...

11:21.337 --> 11:23.837
give me one minute? Yeah.

11:23.839 --> 11:26.540
I... have no idea what
you're talking about.

11:26.542 --> 11:27.808
Don't mess with us

11:27.810 --> 11:29.576
- right now, man, it's my wife...
- Ex-wife.

11:29.578 --> 11:31.812
My ex-wife's life is on the line.

11:31.814 --> 11:36.049
You... so you're trying
to help your ex-wife?

11:37.153 --> 11:38.886
Something's wrong with you, buddy.

11:38.888 --> 11:40.154
Maybe not the best time

11:40.156 --> 11:41.388
to push that particular button.

11:41.390 --> 11:43.357
Yeah?

11:43.359 --> 11:45.092
If she's anything like my ex,

11:45.094 --> 11:46.794
I say let her die.

12:01.644 --> 12:03.477
Now, see, I would do this myself,

12:03.479 --> 12:05.946
but painting hand and all that.

12:05.948 --> 12:08.182
You are making a big mistake.

12:08.184 --> 12:09.650
You're right.

12:09.652 --> 12:11.652
I can just find
something to hit you with!

12:11.654 --> 12:12.786
Duh!

12:14.123 --> 12:16.423
Right, I'm not sure what
lead I'm following here,

12:16.425 --> 12:18.392
but am I supposed to
let them punch me, too?

12:18.394 --> 12:21.695
What? No.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.264
I screwed up. Okay, Lucifer?

12:24.266 --> 12:25.933
I let my anger get the better of me

12:25.935 --> 12:27.367
and now Chloe's gonna pay for it.

12:27.369 --> 12:29.636
What, so this isn't some
elaborate game of bloody possum?

12:29.638 --> 12:30.737
Of course not!

12:30.739 --> 12:32.472
Oh, well, in that case...

12:34.610 --> 12:36.276
Wait, are you kidding me?

12:36.278 --> 12:38.579
You could have gotten out
of those this whole time?

12:38.581 --> 12:39.780
Well, of course I could.

12:39.782 --> 12:41.014
Right, catch.

12:44.635 --> 12:46.053
Why the hell didn't you stop them

12:46.055 --> 12:47.054
from beating the crap out of me?

12:47.056 --> 12:48.155
Because I promised you

12:48.157 --> 12:50.090
I wouldn't do anything
without your permission.

12:50.092 --> 12:51.892
Oh, right. Of course.

12:51.894 --> 12:52.926
Right.

12:55.764 --> 12:57.865
- This is gonna have to...
- Take a swing

12:57.867 --> 12:59.233
and I'll shove that so far up your ass,

12:59.235 --> 13:00.734
you'll have splinters in your stool.

13:04.707 --> 13:05.973
Right.

13:05.975 --> 13:08.842
Since torture takes too
long and Dan's already wasted

13:08.844 --> 13:11.211
so much time, why don't we speed
things along and make a deal?

13:11.213 --> 13:12.913
You have something we want.

13:12.915 --> 13:14.214
What would you like in return?

13:14.216 --> 13:15.749
Wait, what?

13:15.751 --> 13:18.218
Quickly, now. What is it you desire?

13:19.955 --> 13:21.088
I want...

13:21.090 --> 13:22.422
Hmm?

13:22.424 --> 13:24.091
I-I want someone to buy my art

13:24.093 --> 13:25.592
because they actually like it.

13:27.329 --> 13:28.896
Clients only buy my paintings because

13:28.898 --> 13:31.765
they're forced to as
part of our deal, but...

13:31.767 --> 13:34.101
I know they just throw 'em away.

13:34.103 --> 13:35.836
And treat 'em like trash.

13:35.838 --> 13:38.238
An insult to trash.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.140
All I want...

13:40.142 --> 13:42.276
more than anything, is just...

13:42.278 --> 13:44.077
is to be treated like a real artist.

13:44.079 --> 13:46.380
Really? That's it?

13:48.117 --> 13:49.917
Well, miracles aren't my thing,

13:49.919 --> 13:51.618
but I'm sure we can
come to an arrangement.

13:56.277 --> 13:59.960
The sacrifices we make
for the greater good.

13:59.962 --> 14:01.762
What? You're not the
one that has to look

14:01.764 --> 14:04.031
at this monstrosity every day.

14:04.033 --> 14:05.132
Ah.

14:07.036 --> 14:08.602
Here you go.

14:10.593 --> 14:11.892
What is this?

14:11.917 --> 14:13.540
It's the antidote ingredients

14:13.542 --> 14:14.675
I gathered for Professor Carlisle.

14:14.677 --> 14:15.742
Well, what about the formula?

14:15.744 --> 14:16.777
What about it?

14:16.779 --> 14:17.844
We need to know the amounts

14:17.846 --> 14:18.946
of each ingredient he used.

14:18.948 --> 14:20.514
If we get it wrong, it could be lethal.

14:20.516 --> 14:23.150
The professor kept the
formula all to himself.

14:23.152 --> 14:24.587
He liked to brag about

14:24.612 --> 14:27.187
how the only place it
existed was in his head.

14:27.189 --> 14:28.422
You'd... you'd have to ask him.

14:28.424 --> 14:29.790
Yeah, well, we can't do that.

14:29.792 --> 14:31.058
He's dead.

14:31.060 --> 14:32.960
Oh.

14:32.962 --> 14:35.529
Um...

14:35.531 --> 14:37.097
you still want the
painting though, right?

14:37.099 --> 14:39.533
Uh...

14:48.510 --> 14:51.511
Amenadiel told me about your detective.

14:51.513 --> 14:53.814
I'm sorry, son.

14:56.552 --> 14:59.386
I can't even go in there.

14:59.388 --> 15:03.156
I'd have to tell her how
monumentally screwed she is.

15:03.158 --> 15:05.692
Or... or lie.

15:05.694 --> 15:08.095
And we both know I can't do that.

15:08.097 --> 15:10.964
Well, if it's any consolation,

15:10.966 --> 15:12.265
you of all people should know

15:12.267 --> 15:15.102
that the man that did this
is right where he belongs:

15:15.104 --> 15:16.870
suffering in Hell.

15:18.474 --> 15:20.774
You're right. That... that's it.

15:20.776 --> 15:23.610
Well, I'm glad I was
able to comfort you.

15:23.612 --> 15:24.711
No, no, Mum, you figured it out.

15:24.713 --> 15:26.213
How I'm gonna save the detective.

15:26.215 --> 15:28.582
Um, I'm not sure I understand.

15:28.584 --> 15:31.018
I'm gonna pop down to Hell and
have a chat with the professor.

15:31.020 --> 15:32.686
What? How?

15:32.688 --> 15:34.054
Well, it's simple.

15:34.056 --> 15:37.975
All I need to do is die.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.442
The plan is simple:

15:44.444 --> 15:46.411
you kill me, I go down to Hell,

15:46.413 --> 15:47.612
interrogate the professor,

15:47.614 --> 15:49.869
get the formula and
then you bring me back.

15:51.561 --> 15:52.860
Well, come on! Who's in?

15:52.862 --> 15:55.663
This is a terrible idea.
I absolutely forbid it.

15:55.665 --> 15:57.932
I hate to agree with Her Highness,

15:57.934 --> 15:59.100
but she's right.

15:59.102 --> 16:00.535
You'd be on your own.

16:00.537 --> 16:01.702
We both know

16:01.704 --> 16:02.937
I can't go down with you.

16:02.939 --> 16:04.672
Well, I went down and
came back once before,

16:04.674 --> 16:05.806
it wasn't a problem.

16:05.808 --> 16:07.608
That's because Father brought you back.

16:07.610 --> 16:10.077
And you didn't go
through any of the doors.

16:10.079 --> 16:12.813
Once you do, you could
be trapped... forever.

16:12.815 --> 16:14.315
Well, that won't happen, will it?

16:14.317 --> 16:16.183
I'm the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.652
You were the Lord of Hell.

16:17.654 --> 16:19.587
You've been away

16:19.589 --> 16:20.821
quite a long time.

16:20.823 --> 16:22.757
You can't be certain
that this will work.

16:25.428 --> 16:27.028
What do you think?

16:28.264 --> 16:31.866
I think...

16:31.868 --> 16:36.070
that I followed about half of that.

16:38.441 --> 16:41.275
Do you guys do this a lot?

16:41.277 --> 16:44.679
Like, celestial planning sessions?

16:44.681 --> 16:46.647
Oh, apparently not. Otherwise,

16:46.649 --> 16:48.316
we would have had a meeting
about carelessly revealing

16:48.318 --> 16:49.750
our true nature to a human.

16:49.752 --> 16:51.218
- Oh...
- Which...

16:51.220 --> 16:53.955
she has apparently known about
for a while and kept from me.

16:53.957 --> 16:55.389
Yeah, well, turnabout's fair play.

16:55.391 --> 16:56.257
Hmm.

16:56.259 --> 16:58.059
Okay, wrapping my brain

16:58.061 --> 16:59.293
around this...

16:59.295 --> 17:00.795
Lucifer, what makes you so sure

17:00.797 --> 17:01.862
you'd go to Hell?

17:01.864 --> 17:03.097
In case you've missed it, doctor,

17:03.099 --> 17:04.198
I've been banned from Heaven.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.665
There's no where else for me to go.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.002
And you're sure there's
no other way to get there?

17:08.003 --> 17:09.502
I mean...

17:09.505 --> 17:10.771
I mean, dying?

17:10.772 --> 17:12.707
Well, if anyone has a better suggestion,

17:12.709 --> 17:14.295
by all means, speak up now.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.042
Quite frankly, I'd prefer to Uber there.

17:16.045 --> 17:17.712
But...

17:17.714 --> 17:20.848
look, I am doing this
with or without you.

17:20.849 --> 17:22.650
Well, I'm sorry.

17:22.652 --> 17:26.153
Having spent millennia
in that terrible place,

17:26.155 --> 17:28.489
I can't be part of you going back.

17:28.491 --> 17:30.157
Not even for a moment.

17:30.159 --> 17:31.926
Fine.

17:31.928 --> 17:34.829
Amenadiel?

17:35.965 --> 17:37.365
Are you coming?

17:39.522 --> 17:41.355
No, Mom, I'm gonna help.

17:42.456 --> 17:44.572
Chloe, she doesn't deserve this.

17:44.574 --> 17:46.207
This is the craziest plan

17:46.209 --> 17:47.475
I've ever heard.

17:47.477 --> 17:49.510
I'm in.

17:49.512 --> 17:53.047
Doctor, surely you have
some sensible advice.

17:53.049 --> 17:54.448
Um, he's the Devil.

17:55.618 --> 17:57.018
Nothing's really been sensible

17:57.020 --> 17:58.467
since I found that out.

17:59.422 --> 18:01.856
I will not help you
get trapped down there.

18:01.858 --> 18:05.126
Not for some insignificant human's life.

18:07.530 --> 18:09.163
Okay.

18:09.165 --> 18:12.066
Now that party pooper's gone,
let's get started, shall we?

18:12.068 --> 18:13.401
So, um,

18:13.403 --> 18:16.871
what's my part in all of this?

18:16.873 --> 18:19.106
Well, you went to
medical school, correct?

18:19.108 --> 18:22.209
Many... many, many, many years ago.

18:22.211 --> 18:24.645
Good. So you'll be the one
bringing me back from the dead.

18:25.820 --> 18:28.049
Okay, who wants to kill me?

18:33.456 --> 18:36.190
Ah, Daniel, there you
are. Have you gathered

18:36.192 --> 18:38.059
the ingredients for the antidote yet?

18:38.061 --> 18:40.661
What? No, I've just been
spending time with Chloe.

18:40.663 --> 18:43.698
Besides, those ingredients are
useless without the formula.

18:43.700 --> 18:44.865
Well, you might want to hop on it,

18:44.867 --> 18:46.367
because I'm about to get the formula.

18:46.369 --> 18:47.601
What? How?

18:47.603 --> 18:49.203
Fairly certain you don't want to know.

18:49.205 --> 18:52.006
Well, you... You do what you have to.

18:52.008 --> 18:53.507
Ella and I will get those ingredients.

18:53.509 --> 18:55.409
Right.

19:06.155 --> 19:07.455
This is crazy.

19:07.457 --> 19:08.489
I can't do this.

19:08.491 --> 19:09.590
Yeah, and neither can I.

19:09.592 --> 19:11.726
These scrubs are so boxy.

19:11.728 --> 19:14.095
Even I can't pull 'em off.

19:15.311 --> 19:16.630
Scratch that.

19:16.632 --> 19:18.899
I can pull off anything.

19:18.901 --> 19:20.434
Yes, you're right. We can do this.

19:20.436 --> 19:21.602
We can do this, right?

19:21.604 --> 19:22.770
We have to.

19:22.772 --> 19:24.972
- Chloe's life depends on it.
- This is it.

19:24.974 --> 19:27.441
This is the room directly below Chloe's.

19:28.444 --> 19:29.944
Make sure no one

19:29.946 --> 19:30.945
moves the detective.

19:30.947 --> 19:32.379
I'll be in the room below,

19:32.381 --> 19:33.914
but she needs to remain
in there for this to work.

19:33.916 --> 19:35.750
Because being close to
her makes you vulnerable.

19:35.752 --> 19:38.519
Well, killable, in this case, but yes.

19:38.521 --> 19:40.354
So I keep her here until you're dead?

19:41.324 --> 19:42.923
No, no, no. The entire time.

19:42.925 --> 19:44.391
Even after you've already been killed?

19:44.393 --> 19:45.993
Well, who knows what happens
if I become invulnerable

19:45.995 --> 19:47.161
when I'm already dead.

19:47.163 --> 19:48.729
There's a good chance

19:48.731 --> 19:50.097
the doctor won't be able to revive me.

19:50.099 --> 19:52.066
And we don't want me
to stay dead, do we?

19:52.091 --> 19:54.101
That was a rhetorical question.

19:54.103 --> 19:55.569
- Right.
- Right.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.204
And you trust me with this?

19:57.206 --> 19:58.272
Brother,

19:58.274 --> 19:59.840
you're the most stubborn,

19:59.842 --> 20:01.142
bullheaded person I know.

20:01.144 --> 20:03.377
If anyone can prevent the detective

20:03.379 --> 20:04.812
from being moved, it's you.

20:05.748 --> 20:06.981
Luci?

20:06.983 --> 20:09.759
What? What?

20:09.784 --> 20:11.317
Good luck.

20:11.342 --> 20:12.386
Don't worry, brother.

20:12.388 --> 20:14.908
It feels like a good day to die.

20:23.385 --> 20:25.585
Ella?

20:25.587 --> 20:27.420
You got a package from CDC.

20:27.422 --> 20:29.022
How many more ingredients do we need?

20:29.024 --> 20:31.191
Well, based off the list
from that middleman dude,

20:31.193 --> 20:32.659
we've gathered all but one:

20:32.661 --> 20:34.294
a chemical called ZX3.

20:34.296 --> 20:36.029
Super rare, super illegal.

20:36.031 --> 20:37.030
How rare?

20:37.032 --> 20:38.164
Let's put it this way:

20:38.166 --> 20:39.833
all my legal contacts
are out of this stuff.

20:39.835 --> 20:41.534
Wait, you have illegal contacts?

20:41.536 --> 20:43.654
You don't? Whatever.

20:43.679 --> 20:47.574
Some street racers secretly
add drops of ZX3 to their fuel

20:47.576 --> 20:48.708
for a super shady advantage.

20:48.710 --> 20:49.676
How do you know that?

20:49.678 --> 20:51.878
I used to steal cars.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.947
It's not fun if you don't
drive 'em really, really fast.

20:53.949 --> 20:55.582
Anyway,

20:55.607 --> 20:58.785
I know where some black
market ZX3 is locked up:

20:58.787 --> 21:00.253
a chop shop in NoHo.

21:00.255 --> 21:03.156
Problem is, I'm not sure I can
get the owner to hand it over.

21:03.158 --> 21:04.658
And we don't have time for a warrant.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.027
Well, desperate times...

21:07.029 --> 21:08.428
Call for a little B&E.

21:08.430 --> 21:09.796
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

21:11.253 --> 21:12.832
Right, so one zap

21:12.834 --> 21:14.668
of this doohickey will stop my heart?

21:14.670 --> 21:17.604
Uh, the defibrillator wasn't
made for that, but yes.

21:17.606 --> 21:19.973
Not what I thought I'd
be doing with my day.

21:19.975 --> 21:21.741
I'm gonna give you 60 seconds,

21:21.743 --> 21:23.510
then restart your
heart to bring you back.

21:23.512 --> 21:25.912
60 seconds? I've had
orgasms that last longer.

21:25.914 --> 21:28.148
Time moves much slower
down there. Remember?

21:28.150 --> 21:29.516
Yes, but we only get one shot at this.

21:29.518 --> 21:31.284
What if you yank me out
before I get the formula?

21:31.286 --> 21:33.687
60 seconds is already cutting
it closer than I'd like.

21:33.689 --> 21:35.855
The brain only lasts
three minutes after death.

21:35.857 --> 21:37.457
Or so I read.

21:37.459 --> 21:40.193
Just now. Like, on the ride over.

21:40.826 --> 21:42.562
Why am I doing this again?

21:42.564 --> 21:43.382
Because you care about

21:43.406 --> 21:45.532
saving the detective's
life almost as much as I do.

21:45.534 --> 21:46.833
Now, come on!

21:46.835 --> 21:48.468
I also care about your life, Lucifer!

21:50.572 --> 21:53.807
Okay, ice to slow your
brain cells from dying,

21:53.809 --> 21:55.442
and painkillers to, well, kill the pain.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.143
Got it covered, thanks.

21:57.145 --> 21:58.945
Okay, Maze, just like I showed you.

21:58.947 --> 22:01.047
Yeah, got it.

22:05.721 --> 22:07.020
Okay. You ready?

22:11.422 --> 22:14.189
- I can't! You do it.
- No, no, no, no.

22:14.214 --> 22:16.096
No, the deal was you kill
him, I bring him back.

22:16.098 --> 22:18.164
- But you're the doctor!
- And you're the demon from Hell!

22:18.166 --> 22:19.399
Goodness sake.

22:19.401 --> 22:22.702
Whoa!

22:22.704 --> 22:24.771
Oh, my God.

22:24.773 --> 22:25.872
He's dead.

22:28.076 --> 22:29.736
He's really dead.

22:56.705 --> 22:57.871
Who are you?

22:57.873 --> 22:59.339
I'm Amenadiel.

22:59.341 --> 23:00.917
I'm Lucifer's brother.

23:01.722 --> 23:04.677
He, uh, asked me to watch over your mom.

23:04.679 --> 23:07.013
Like a guardian angel?

23:08.383 --> 23:10.550
I like your necklace.

23:10.552 --> 23:11.851
Thanks.

23:11.853 --> 23:14.387
I, um, I like yours too.

23:17.459 --> 23:19.592
A bad man did this to my mommy.

23:21.563 --> 23:24.164
Why are there bad people in the world?

23:25.674 --> 23:27.634
I really don't know.

23:27.636 --> 23:31.805
There might be bad people in
the world, but you know what?

23:31.807 --> 23:33.740
There's a lot more good people in it.

23:33.742 --> 23:34.941
Really?

23:34.943 --> 23:36.609
Yeah.

23:36.611 --> 23:38.678
Like all the good people
helping out your mom.

23:40.882 --> 23:42.048
Like you?

23:42.050 --> 23:44.951
Well, I'm, uh...

23:44.953 --> 23:46.453
I'm trying to be good.

23:46.455 --> 23:48.621
I think you're good.

24:19.821 --> 24:21.654
Yes.

24:21.656 --> 24:23.056
About bloody time.

24:33.168 --> 24:34.901
Help!

24:34.903 --> 24:36.936
Help!

24:36.938 --> 24:40.173
Hey, hey, man, I'm
tra... I think I'm stuck.

24:40.175 --> 24:42.342
Hey, can you help me?
I think my arm's stuck.

24:42.344 --> 24:43.343
Just take my...

24:43.345 --> 24:44.410
What?!

24:44.412 --> 24:45.812
Hey, man, I'm trapped!

24:45.814 --> 24:47.780
You can't leave me here!

24:47.782 --> 24:50.517
Hey! Help!

24:54.356 --> 24:56.556
- Coward.
- No. Killer.

24:56.558 --> 24:58.191
- No.
- Murderer.

24:58.193 --> 25:00.226
Monster.

25:00.228 --> 25:01.494
- Killer.
- Coward!

25:01.496 --> 25:04.063
No, you don't understand.

25:04.065 --> 25:06.165
I had no choice.

25:07.969 --> 25:09.903
Leave me alone!

25:09.905 --> 25:11.838
- Please!
- Coward!

25:11.840 --> 25:13.439
No!

25:13.441 --> 25:15.975
Professor Jason Carlisle.

25:15.977 --> 25:17.610
Remember me?

25:17.612 --> 25:20.847
It keeps happening. Over and over.

25:20.849 --> 25:22.048
It's like I'm in Hell!

25:22.050 --> 25:23.483
There's no "like" about it.

25:25.153 --> 25:26.386
What is this?

25:26.388 --> 25:29.956
This is a torture of your own making.

25:29.958 --> 25:31.090
Fueled by guilt.

25:31.092 --> 25:32.892
With a little bit of
flair thrown in for fun.

25:32.917 --> 25:34.176
Please.

25:34.201 --> 25:35.962
I need to get out of here.

25:35.964 --> 25:37.096
How do I get out?

25:37.098 --> 25:38.498
Well, it's quite simple,

25:38.500 --> 25:39.866
you can't.

25:39.868 --> 25:41.254
- What?
- Not until you no

25:41.279 --> 25:43.269
longer believe you deserve it.

25:43.271 --> 25:45.705
And I have never seen anyone
pull themselves out of here.

25:45.707 --> 25:47.073
Oh, God, no, no, no.

25:47.075 --> 25:49.242
- No, no...
- However,

25:49.244 --> 25:51.411
perhaps making some
amends for your misdeeds

25:51.413 --> 25:52.745
might do the trick.

25:52.747 --> 25:54.213
Anything. Please.

25:54.215 --> 25:55.381
How do I make amends?

25:55.383 --> 25:58.918
Well, before you so
rudely ended your own life,

25:58.920 --> 26:00.253
you poisoned a detective.

26:00.255 --> 26:02.121
Someone who I care about very much.

26:02.123 --> 26:05.191
There's still time to save her.

26:05.193 --> 26:07.293
So, if you give me the
formula to her antidote,

26:07.295 --> 26:10.063
perhaps your guilt might be alleviated.

26:10.065 --> 26:11.431
Yeah?

26:14.002 --> 26:15.969
Tick tock, Professor!

26:19.374 --> 26:20.373
There.

26:20.375 --> 26:21.541
The formula.

26:21.543 --> 26:23.109
Does that make us good?

26:26.147 --> 26:27.280
You tell me.

26:33.121 --> 26:34.220
I didn't think so.

26:36.625 --> 26:38.257
No.

26:38.259 --> 26:39.726
No, please!

26:39.728 --> 26:40.793
No!

26:40.795 --> 26:42.929
No! No!

26:54.709 --> 26:57.110
Where's a resurrection
when you need one?

26:59.547 --> 27:02.949
Could really use my
flask right about now.

27:37.318 --> 27:40.286
I never could play as
well as you, brother.

27:49.121 --> 27:50.687
Uriel...

27:50.689 --> 27:51.722
I...

27:51.724 --> 27:53.190
I know.

27:53.192 --> 27:54.858
It's a lot to take in, isn't it?

27:54.860 --> 27:57.594
I don't...

28:01.634 --> 28:03.300
I-I don't understand, Azrael's blade,

28:03.302 --> 28:05.335
it should've destroyed
you, not sent you to Hell.

28:05.337 --> 28:07.271
You don't deserve to be here, brother.

28:07.273 --> 28:08.972
You're right, I don't.

28:08.974 --> 28:10.440
But you do.

28:15.515 --> 28:17.581
You think it's that easy to let go?

28:18.584 --> 28:19.919
Think again, brother.

28:27.226 --> 28:30.427
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, what's happening?

28:30.429 --> 28:31.962
What's happening?

28:31.964 --> 28:34.364
I need to save the detective.

28:34.366 --> 28:37.200
But you just can't
help yourself, can you?

28:41.140 --> 28:42.873
You have to believe me,

28:42.875 --> 28:44.508
I didn't want this.

28:44.510 --> 28:46.577
And yet...

28:51.550 --> 28:54.017
60 seconds! Clear!

28:59.569 --> 29:01.269
I thought you said
this would work, Linda!

29:01.294 --> 29:03.061
Shh! Clear!

29:06.165 --> 29:08.098
No, no, no!

29:08.100 --> 29:09.600
What was I thinking?

29:10.862 --> 29:12.995
This was always a terrible idea.

29:17.409 --> 29:19.810
You know, we are not cat burglars.

29:19.812 --> 29:21.511
We are totally gonna get caught.

29:21.513 --> 29:22.713
"Cat burglars"?

29:22.715 --> 29:24.548
What are you, an old-timey desperado?

29:24.550 --> 29:26.917
I'm just saying we're a
little out of our element.

29:26.919 --> 29:28.518
Speak for yourself.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.620
Yeah, I noticed.

29:29.622 --> 29:31.555
Where'd you learn to
pick a lock like that?

29:31.557 --> 29:32.623
My grandma.

29:32.625 --> 29:33.857
Wow.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.659
And what exactly are
we looking for again?

29:35.661 --> 29:37.327
Hey!

29:37.329 --> 29:39.162
You picked the wrong place to rob.

29:40.599 --> 29:42.466
I'm sorry.

29:42.468 --> 29:44.901
I'm sorry, I can't make it stop.

29:44.903 --> 29:45.902
"It?"

29:45.904 --> 29:48.405
As if you had no part in it.

29:48.407 --> 29:50.307
I don't! I didn't.

29:50.309 --> 29:51.408
I-I don't want this!

29:51.410 --> 29:52.509
Look at you.

29:52.511 --> 29:54.378
So pitiful.

29:54.380 --> 29:56.279
Stuck in the very Hell you once ruled.

29:56.281 --> 29:58.482
Trapped by your own guilt.

29:58.484 --> 30:00.350
And while we're pointing
out how lame you are,

30:00.352 --> 30:03.053
you didn't even follow up
on that thing I told you.

30:04.423 --> 30:06.723
What I whispered in
your ear before I died.

30:06.725 --> 30:08.425
What?

30:08.427 --> 30:10.961
"The peace is here"?

30:10.963 --> 30:13.063
The peace is here.

30:13.065 --> 30:15.832
I... I thought that was just nonsense.

30:15.834 --> 30:19.236
The... the final ramblings
of a dying brain. I...

30:19.238 --> 30:23.573
Unless you're saying you found
peace in that moment, brother.

30:23.575 --> 30:24.775
Oh, Luci, Luci, Luci.

30:24.777 --> 30:26.176
You should know better than that.

30:26.178 --> 30:28.311
I'm all about patterns,

30:28.313 --> 30:30.080
predicting the future.

30:30.082 --> 30:31.782
My last words were a clue.

30:31.784 --> 30:33.250
A clue? A clue to what?

30:33.252 --> 30:35.352
Well, you're the one who has
to figure that out, aren't you?

30:35.354 --> 30:36.553
After all,

30:36.555 --> 30:38.655
I'm just in your head.

30:38.657 --> 30:42.726
I'm just a manifestation of
your own guilty conscience.

30:42.728 --> 30:44.795
Speaking of...

30:46.932 --> 30:48.732
Ouch.

30:50.534 --> 30:51.967
No.

30:51.992 --> 30:53.470
I hope you didn't leave any

30:53.472 --> 30:55.505
- unfinished business up on Earth...
- What?

30:55.507 --> 30:57.187
...'cause you're never
getting out of here.

31:04.883 --> 31:05.949
What's happening?

31:05.951 --> 31:07.617
Doctor just paged us. She's in V-tach.

31:07.619 --> 31:09.086
I don't know.

31:09.088 --> 31:11.488
- Let's go wait outside, okay?
- Crash cart's on its way.

31:11.490 --> 31:14.558
It's okay, I'm gonna stay with your mom.

31:14.560 --> 31:15.726
Go with the nurse.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.933
Go ahead and turn her on her side.

31:22.935 --> 31:25.035
Crash cart standing by.

31:25.756 --> 31:27.070
She's seizing.

31:27.072 --> 31:28.505
This isn't right.

31:28.507 --> 31:30.574
Something's wrong in Hell.

31:30.576 --> 31:31.575
What?

31:31.577 --> 31:32.609
He's stuck.

31:32.611 --> 31:33.844
Trapped in one of those cells.

31:33.846 --> 31:35.312
That's why we can't revive him.

31:35.314 --> 31:37.180
Okay, so then what do we
have to do to bust him out?

31:37.182 --> 31:39.483
Someone needs to go down
there and pull him out.

31:39.485 --> 31:41.618
I'd go, but I can't.

31:41.620 --> 31:43.320
Why not?

31:43.322 --> 31:44.733
Demons don't have a soul.

31:44.758 --> 31:46.523
If I die,

31:46.525 --> 31:47.991
I just... die.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.060
Okay, that's definitely
a discussion topic

31:50.062 --> 31:52.863
for another time, but right
now, every second counts.

31:52.865 --> 31:56.266
And I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

31:56.268 --> 31:58.301
- what if I go?
- What?

31:58.303 --> 32:00.871
You? What makes you think
you'd go to Hell and not Heaven?

32:00.873 --> 32:02.539
There are things you
don't know about me.

32:02.541 --> 32:04.875
- No. No way.
- But Maze...

32:04.877 --> 32:06.076
Send me.

32:06.078 --> 32:07.744
Well.

32:07.746 --> 32:09.446
Look who decided to show up.

32:09.448 --> 32:10.781
I'll go down and get him.

32:10.783 --> 32:12.349
You said you'd never go back.

32:12.351 --> 32:14.417
Yes, I have a paralyzing
fear of the place.

32:14.419 --> 32:16.753
But I would face a thousand
Hells to save my son.

32:16.755 --> 32:18.388
Ever since I escaped,

32:18.390 --> 32:20.924
Hell's been constantly
trying to pull me back.

32:20.926 --> 32:23.794
It's only my resistance that allows me

32:23.796 --> 32:25.295
to fight its pull.

32:25.297 --> 32:26.630
So, I just...

32:26.632 --> 32:30.133
won't resist.

32:30.135 --> 32:31.434
So, how do we do this?

32:31.436 --> 32:32.778
It appears

32:32.803 --> 32:34.571
that we need to attach
these little wires

32:34.573 --> 32:36.072
to the skin...

32:38.010 --> 32:40.076
Maze!

32:40.078 --> 32:41.812
Oops.

32:59.836 --> 33:01.302
She's still in V-tach.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.927
- Midazolam, four milligrams.
- Yes, Doctor.

33:06.866 --> 33:08.366
Thanks.

33:08.368 --> 33:09.300
Get it in that line.

33:09.302 --> 33:10.935
I got the IV.

33:10.937 --> 33:12.870
There we go.

33:12.872 --> 33:14.305
Okay.

33:14.307 --> 33:15.573
We need to move her to CT.

33:15.575 --> 33:16.641
I'll call them.

33:18.611 --> 33:19.911
Sir. You need to move.

33:19.913 --> 33:21.379
I can't let her leave.

33:21.381 --> 33:22.480
We're trying to save her life.

33:22.482 --> 33:23.448
So am I.

33:23.450 --> 33:24.882
Security.

33:24.884 --> 33:25.950
Security!

33:25.952 --> 33:27.785
I can explain.

33:27.787 --> 33:29.917
Just... lower the weapon.

33:29.942 --> 33:31.810
Yeah. You better explain.

33:31.812 --> 33:33.278
Before I shoot you for
busting into my place...

33:33.280 --> 33:35.080
Ricardo! Tranquilo, okay?

33:35.082 --> 33:36.448
No seas estÃºpido.

33:36.450 --> 33:37.515
Lower the gun.

33:37.517 --> 33:38.683
W-What...

33:38.685 --> 33:40.619
Ella?

33:40.621 --> 33:42.687
What are you doing here?

33:42.689 --> 33:44.456
You know this guy?

33:44.458 --> 33:46.157
Only since birth.

33:46.159 --> 33:48.927
Dan, meet Ricardo, my idiot brother.

33:48.929 --> 33:50.695
- I'm not an idiot.
- Sorry.

33:50.697 --> 33:52.864
Thieving, cowardly, neglectful idiot.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.432
- This is your brother?
- Yep.

33:54.434 --> 33:56.468
Then why didn't you
just ask him for the ZX3?

33:56.470 --> 33:57.969
'Cause after I moved out here

33:57.971 --> 34:00.205
to keep an eye on him,
he totally ghosted me!

34:00.207 --> 34:02.574
I get it. Okay?

34:02.576 --> 34:05.377
You want to keep your
law enforcement sis away

34:05.379 --> 34:08.545
from your shady shenanigans.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.681
Watch. He's gonna try and
say he doesn't have any ZX3.

34:10.684 --> 34:12.183
I don't have any ZX3.

34:12.185 --> 34:13.184
We're not here to bust you.

34:13.186 --> 34:14.386
Yeah, man. We're the ones

34:14.388 --> 34:16.054
- who are breaking and entering.
- Exactly.

34:16.056 --> 34:17.722
- Totes illegal.
- Come on, Ella.

34:17.724 --> 34:20.792
You know better. All right?
I can't take any chances.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.127
Ricky.

34:22.129 --> 34:24.728
The ZX3's for a friend.

34:24.731 --> 34:27.666
Without it, she's gonna die.

34:27.668 --> 34:29.801
And I really don't want her to die.

34:34.341 --> 34:35.440
Follow me.

34:37.482 --> 34:39.081
I hate you.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.913
I love you, too.

34:44.418 --> 34:46.951
I-I know. I know.

34:46.953 --> 34:49.387
Hurts you more than it does me.

34:49.389 --> 34:50.922
Please, please, forgive me, brother.

34:50.924 --> 34:52.223
I had no choice.

34:52.225 --> 34:53.958
Do you really believe that?

34:53.960 --> 34:55.560
No.

35:01.368 --> 35:02.634
Lucifer!

35:03.570 --> 35:05.170
Mum?

35:06.640 --> 35:08.406
What are you doing here?

35:08.408 --> 35:10.141
I'm your rescue party of one.

35:10.143 --> 35:11.676
You don't belong down here.

35:11.678 --> 35:12.644
Not anymore.

35:12.646 --> 35:13.678
But look.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.380
Look what I've done.

35:15.382 --> 35:19.250
Lucifer, this Uriel isn't real.

35:19.252 --> 35:21.419
I wish he was.

35:21.421 --> 35:24.155
I so badly want to see my son again.

35:24.157 --> 35:28.193
But he's just a part of your Hell.

35:31.598 --> 35:33.598
No.

35:33.600 --> 35:37.268
You were... you were
just trying to save us.

35:39.005 --> 35:40.905
This isn't your fault.

35:47.114 --> 35:49.214
It's mine.

35:52.819 --> 35:54.586
I am to blame for all of this.

35:57.090 --> 35:59.190
Ever since...

35:59.192 --> 36:02.026
ever since I returned, I've been...

36:02.028 --> 36:05.597
I've been manipulating you.

36:05.599 --> 36:08.433
Stoking your anger against
your Father in hopes

36:08.435 --> 36:11.736
of using you against Him.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.639
But...

36:17.244 --> 36:19.077
...but I've just made things worse.

36:20.447 --> 36:24.149
I pushed you and that human closer,

36:24.151 --> 36:26.484
knowing it would crush you

36:26.486 --> 36:28.920
when you learned the truth.

36:28.922 --> 36:31.456
And now look at us.

36:31.458 --> 36:33.124
Stuck in this prison

36:33.126 --> 36:35.894
while Chloe is dying.

36:35.896 --> 36:38.329
Chloe.

36:38.331 --> 36:41.833
No. I killed Uriel because
I had to. To save you.

36:41.835 --> 36:43.501
To save the detective.

36:43.503 --> 36:45.870
And I need to save her now.

36:45.872 --> 36:48.239
Mum. Mum? We need to leave.

36:49.709 --> 36:51.576
Mum?

36:51.578 --> 36:53.978
Why would we leave?

36:53.980 --> 36:56.314
Uriel is right here.

36:56.316 --> 36:58.917
We can stay.

36:58.919 --> 37:00.852
Be a happy family.

37:01.855 --> 37:04.556
I've missed you so much, Mother.

37:04.558 --> 37:06.591
Mum?

37:06.593 --> 37:07.659
Mum.

37:07.661 --> 37:09.961
Mum!

37:09.963 --> 37:11.629
Come on. You pulled me out of my guilt,

37:11.631 --> 37:13.965
there's no time to get
stuck in yours. Come on.

37:13.967 --> 37:16.401
- Come on!
- Please, don't abandon me.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.670
- Not again. Please.
- Mum. Mum.

37:18.672 --> 37:19.804
No...

37:19.806 --> 37:21.506
No. Lucifer...

37:21.508 --> 37:22.774
No, please.

37:22.776 --> 37:24.209
- Shh.
- Uriel!

37:24.211 --> 37:25.610
My sweet boy!

37:25.612 --> 37:27.212
- He's not real.
- Lucifer!

37:27.214 --> 37:29.147
My sweet boy.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.655
Well.

39:17.657 --> 39:19.657
Look who's back.

39:19.659 --> 39:21.459
You didn't die after all.

39:21.461 --> 39:22.860
That makes one of us.

39:27.926 --> 39:29.400
I heard you saved me.

39:29.402 --> 39:31.436
Well...

39:31.438 --> 39:33.204
much as I'd like to take all the credit,

39:33.206 --> 39:35.239
this one was a... a team effort.

39:38.462 --> 39:41.629
You know, this whole
poisoning thing has just...

39:42.849 --> 39:44.549
...really put a pause on everything

39:44.551 --> 39:47.151
that's been going on
with you and I, so...

39:47.153 --> 39:50.855
should we just pick
up where we left off?

39:53.893 --> 39:56.594
I think, right now,
you just need to focus

39:56.596 --> 39:58.196
on feeling better, Detective.

39:59.466 --> 40:02.033
Would you have someone bring Trixie in?

40:02.035 --> 40:03.635
Yes. Yes, of course.

40:03.637 --> 40:05.370
And we'll talk.

40:05.372 --> 40:07.338
We'll talk later, yeah?

40:23.590 --> 40:25.523
How is the detective?

40:25.525 --> 40:27.759
She'll be fine.

40:27.761 --> 40:29.160
And...

40:29.162 --> 40:31.229
what about the two of you?

40:32.532 --> 40:34.265
Well, it was never real, was it?

40:34.267 --> 40:36.267
Lucifer, I am so sorry.

40:36.269 --> 40:38.302
Father brought her into existence

40:38.304 --> 40:40.805
- just to put her in my path.
- Yes.

40:40.807 --> 40:42.940
The whole thing's been a sham, Mum.

40:42.942 --> 40:44.409
Long con.

40:44.411 --> 40:46.244
And I fell for it.

40:46.246 --> 40:47.879
You can't blame yourself.

40:47.881 --> 40:51.816
This is all His doing. And
He should be punished for it.

40:51.818 --> 40:53.885
Oh, make no mistake, I plan on that.

40:53.887 --> 40:55.987
I mean, how can I
trust anything, anyone,

40:55.989 --> 40:59.057
now that I know He
might be behind it all?

40:59.059 --> 41:00.625
Well, you can trust me.

41:00.627 --> 41:01.626
Can I, Mum?

41:01.628 --> 41:03.461
- Yeah.
- You're as bad as He is.

41:03.463 --> 41:05.096
Worse, maybe.

41:05.098 --> 41:07.165
At least He doesn't pretend to love me.

41:07.167 --> 41:08.232
Lucifer.

41:08.234 --> 41:10.835
I do love you.

41:12.105 --> 41:13.905
I went back to Hell for you.

41:13.907 --> 41:16.240
I helped save the detective, for you.

41:16.242 --> 41:18.109
Doesn't that count for anything?

41:18.111 --> 41:20.278
It's too little too late, Mother.

41:21.748 --> 41:25.717
You set out to break my heart. Well...

41:25.719 --> 41:27.146
mission accomplished.

41:27.171 --> 41:28.605
- Lucifer...
- No.

41:30.335 --> 41:32.692
No more manipulations.

41:33.748 --> 41:36.094
This feud that you have
with Father, I refuse

41:36.096 --> 41:38.830
to be caught in the middle any longer.

41:38.832 --> 41:41.332
I am tired of being a pawn.

41:43.036 --> 41:44.435
So, no more.

41:44.437 --> 41:46.513
I'm done.

41:47.373 --> 41:49.207
Lucifer.

41:49.209 --> 41:51.409
Lucifer.

42:03.923 --> 42:05.022
Hey.

42:05.024 --> 42:06.657
It's me again.

42:06.659 --> 42:08.893
Voicemail 337.

42:10.130 --> 42:12.196
Obnoxious, right? But, um...

42:12.198 --> 42:15.399
It's just that you... you
haven't been picking up,

42:15.401 --> 42:18.870
or returning my calls, so...

42:18.872 --> 42:20.471
uh, I'm on my way over.

42:20.473 --> 42:22.306
So, hide the strippers.

42:22.308 --> 42:24.709
Um...

42:24.711 --> 42:27.578
Yeah, um....

42:27.580 --> 42:29.013
I just hope you're okay.

42:30.049 --> 42:31.949
Okay.

42:31.951 --> 42:34.185
Bye.

42:44.998 --> 42:46.297
Lucifer?

42:46.299 --> 42:49.133
Are you here?

43:04.205 --> 43:05.704
