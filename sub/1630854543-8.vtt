01:46.320 --> 01:47.520
Pan?

02:13.520 --> 02:14.880
Any sign of them?

02:16.320 --> 02:17.520
No.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.720
You all right?

02:25.720 --> 02:27.560
I'm not sure.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.280
After everything we've been
through, and now we're here...

02:31.400 --> 02:32.960
It doesn't seem real.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.160
Yeah.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.520
In the tower,
my mother's daemon...

02:41.520 --> 02:43.920
I saw him disappear
right in front of me.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.880
I think she's dead.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.400
I should be relieved.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.160
There's so many things I don't
understand about my parents.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.840
Like what?

03:02.840 --> 03:04.640
Like why they
weren't honest with me.

03:06.200 --> 03:10.120
Why they did such horrible things.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.960
Why wasn't she interested
in me for 13 years,

03:13.960 --> 03:16.280
and then suddenly she was?

03:21.360 --> 03:22.840
Why did they abandon me?

03:26.840 --> 03:29.680
When I thought Asriel
was my uncle,

03:29.680 --> 03:31.000
I idolised him...

03:33.960 --> 03:35.440
..and then I hated him.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.880
And now I can't forgive him, but...

03:41.200 --> 03:42.600
..I don't hate him either.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.440
Well, he won the war.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.320
And we get to be here, so...

03:51.960 --> 03:53.960
I have the strangest feeling
he's gone.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.560
Which means I'm alone.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.760
No, you're not.

LYRA GIGGLES

04:23.680 --> 04:24.960
Oh!

04:33.080 --> 04:34.120
What?

04:35.360 --> 04:36.520
Nothing.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.800
I'm just glad you washed,
because you kind of stank!

04:43.800 --> 04:46.080
THEY LAUGH

04:46.080 --> 04:49.240
PAN:  She doesn't look
like she misses me.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.320
She seems...fine.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.360
She'll be better than fine
when she sees you.

04:55.920 --> 05:00.480
Think how good it'll be
to be with them again, to be close.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.040
What if it doesn't feel the same?

05:03.040 --> 05:04.760
What if it never does?

05:04.760 --> 05:06.920
Lyra loves you.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.200
We're finally in the same world.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.560
We're safe here.

we need to meet.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.240
Pan's here, though.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.480
It's like when he used to hide
in Jordan.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.840
I don't know exactly where he
is, but I can feel him close.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.320
I don't feel torn apart.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.080
And I know he's safe.

IN MULEFA:

07:21.320 --> 07:22.720
Hello.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.600
I think it wants us to follow.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.840
Dr Malone?  Lyra!

07:59.040 --> 08:01.360
I can't believe you're here!
How did you get here?

08:03.360 --> 08:05.080
I was told to find you.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.240
I knew I'd see you again.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.480
Oh, my God, look at you. Hi.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.880
Hi.  Oh, God,
you've been through the wars.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.040
Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.160
Atal, thank you.
How did you get here?

09:30.160 --> 09:31.640
Atal's so beautiful.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.240
I've never seen anything like her.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.640
You know, a year ago, this would
have blown my mind, but

09:38.640 --> 09:41.400
now it's no crazier
than talking bears and angels.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.720
You must find this all
a bit disconcerting.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.040
I know I did.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.600
We've been all over the place,

09:49.600 --> 09:52.640
but I think
this is my favourite world.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.720
I've learned more being here
in the last few months

09:54.720 --> 09:56.320
than I have in decades.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.560
Atal has taught me so much.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.000
Like what?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.640
Like how to trust my instincts.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.800
How to treat a tree with respect.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.000
How do you treat a tree
with respect?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.160
Well, you start off by not
assuming you're better than it.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.560
We have this stupid idea as humans

10:16.560 --> 10:18.680
that we're the pinnacle
of evolution,

10:18.680 --> 10:20.720
but we've got so much wrong.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.400
I want to show you something
in the morning.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.720
Is that what I think it is?

10:35.120 --> 10:37.840
It's the answer to the question
you asked me in Oxford.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.360
Do you remember?

10:39.360 --> 10:41.400
Whether Dust was sin?

10:41.400 --> 10:44.160
Well, your Dust,
my shadow particles -

10:44.160 --> 10:47.720
here, they called it Sraf,
but it's all the same thing.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.200
It's the spark
that means we're alive.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.200
It's consciousness.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.000
So Dust isn't sin?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.560
It's just as good or bad as we are.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.560
Why do you have more Dust
around you than Lyra?

11:02.560 --> 11:04.720
It's the same with the mulefa -

11:04.720 --> 11:07.880
it comes with age and experience.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.200
It's incredible.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.960
How did you make it?

11:11.960 --> 11:14.960
It's the seedpod oil that's the key.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.720
They absorb it, and that's
how they can see Sraf.

11:17.720 --> 11:22.760
They evolved with the trees,
this perfect symbiosis.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.880
Everything was in balance,
and then...

11:26.040 --> 11:27.480
..something changed.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.840
It's heartbreaking, isn't it?

11:35.600 --> 11:37.360
The trees are dying.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.800
Is it some sort of disease?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.840
No, it's the Dust disappearing.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.080
It's just flooding
out of the world.

11:47.080 --> 11:50.200
Thought, imagination, feeling -

11:50.200 --> 11:51.440
all blowing away.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.400
This beautiful place

11:55.400 --> 11:59.040
where the people are kinder
and wiser than us by far,

11:59.040 --> 12:01.080
and it's just dying.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.680
What can save it?

12:04.680 --> 12:07.880
Some way of drawing the Dust back.

12:07.880 --> 12:12.160
In theory, Dust is drawn
to thought, to creativity, so...

12:13.840 --> 12:15.440
..some great discovery?

12:18.120 --> 12:20.680
Atal says I can't think
my way out of it, but...

12:21.880 --> 12:23.640
..can't help but try.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.600
FAINT WHOOSHING

12:48.280 --> 12:52.520
So, these daemons - what are we
looking for exactly?

12:52.520 --> 12:55.720
Well, they look like animals,

12:55.720 --> 12:58.280
but they change depending
on how you're feeling.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.560
So when Pan's a wolverine,
you know you've pissed her off.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.200
THEY LAUGH

13:04.240 --> 13:06.200
But they're a part of you.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.280
Will thought he didn't have one,

13:09.280 --> 13:12.840
because he's from your world,
but he does.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.120
So do you.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.960
I'm still getting my head round it.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.120
Look, nothing surprises me any more.

13:20.120 --> 13:23.440
This whole journey
has been so extraordinary.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.720
I've had to put aside
everything I thought I knew.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.400
But you believe in the soul,
don't you?

13:29.480 --> 13:30.920
I mean, you were a nun.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.200
You were a nun?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.920
Like a nun nun, from my world?

13:34.920 --> 13:37.160
There are still nuns in our world.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.120
So why did you stop?

13:39.120 --> 13:40.400
Er...

13:42.160 --> 13:45.400
Just a lot of things all at once,
really.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.800
ATAL SNORTS

13:57.000 --> 14:02.960
Erm, well, I was at a conference
in Lisbon

14:02.960 --> 14:06.240
and I was giving a paper
on particle physics.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.800
My order were really supportive
of my academic career.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.560
It was my first time abroad
and it had all gone really well

14:14.560 --> 14:16.000
and we were celebrating.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.240
So, I suppose
I was feeling a little daring.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.520
You know, honestly,
up until that point,

14:24.520 --> 14:26.680
I really didn't feel like
my life was lacking.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.240
And, then, I met someone.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.040
She wasn't like the other academics.

14:36.040 --> 14:40.920
She wasn't interested
in showing off how much she knew.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.600
She was just really easy to talk to.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.120
And suddenly, I was sharing things
I never thought I needed to.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.840
And it just opened up

14:50.840 --> 14:55.240
this whole world of possibility,
of feelings...

14:57.000 --> 14:58.680
..I'd never experienced.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.280
And then she gave me this sweet,

15:03.280 --> 15:05.240
this little sugary almond thing.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.480
And as soon as I tasted it,

15:09.480 --> 15:13.000
this memory
came flooding back to me.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.360
And I realised...

15:15.640 --> 15:17.800
..I had felt this feeling before.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.800
Years ago, when I was at school.

15:21.800 --> 15:25.560
Those butterflies
in the pit of my stomach

15:25.560 --> 15:28.480
that ache to be close to someone.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.520
I think I had just been too afraid

15:33.520 --> 15:35.640
to recognise it before,

15:35.640 --> 15:38.000
but I didn't want to forget it
this time.

15:39.440 --> 15:43.160
I knew I couldn't go back
to the convent after that.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.960
I just couldn't bear the idea
of living

15:45.960 --> 15:48.640
without ever feeling that alive.

15:50.960 --> 15:55.240
And I thought,
will anyone be better off

15:55.240 --> 15:58.720
if I just go back to the hotel
and say my prayers

15:58.720 --> 16:02.400
and promise never to fall
into temptation again?

16:02.400 --> 16:04.920
And the answer came back.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.200
No.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.680
No-one will.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.840
And I realised...

16:13.720 --> 16:17.560
..there was no-one there
to reward me for being a good girl

16:17.560 --> 16:20.480
or no-one there to punish me
for being wicked.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.960
There was no-one.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.400
And it was...

16:25.400 --> 16:27.560
It was liberating.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.520
And it was... It was a bit lonely.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.960
But I just knew I wanted
to experience everything

16:35.960 --> 16:37.320
the world had to offer.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.280
I wanted to experience love.

16:40.720 --> 16:41.960
And did you?

16:44.120 --> 16:45.520
Yeah.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.800
Were you scared?

16:47.800 --> 16:49.920
Oh, my God, I was terrified.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.680
I was risking everything,
and I was sure I'd be rejected.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.680
But it was worth it.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.720
It's rare when it happens.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.800
When you feel that way,
you have to grab it.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.560
It's funny, isn't it?

17:12.880 --> 17:14.240
One little moment.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.840
All she did was offer me a sweet,

17:16.840 --> 17:18.560
and it changed my life forever.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.920
For the first time,

17:22.920 --> 17:25.240
I was doing something
with all of my nature.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.280
Not just a part of it.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.480
WHISPERING: Where are you, Pan?

17:52.240 --> 17:54.720
There's so many things
I want to talk to you about.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.200
Eve was weak in body and mind.

18:10.440 --> 18:13.040
She was deceived by the cunning
of the serpent's tongue.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.320
We will cut out that tongue.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.720
We will... SPY-FLY CHIRPS

Good morning.

19:04.920 --> 19:05.960
Morning.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.520
I've just brought you
something to eat.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.640
Thanks.  Morning.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.000
Morning.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.240
I was going to join Atal
and the others

19:22.240 --> 19:23.360
at the seedpod grove,

19:23.360 --> 19:26.680
but I can help you look
for your daemons if you'd like.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.920
Uh...

19:29.400 --> 19:30.920
No. No need, I think.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.240
I mean, we'll be fine
on our own, right?

19:34.240 --> 19:36.320
Yeah, fine on our own.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.800
Yeah.  Thank you.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.360
OK.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.600
Bye.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.840
Bye.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.200
It's strange how Pan's here,
but he won't show himself.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.760
I hope...

20:02.760 --> 20:04.200
You hope what?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.880
I hope he's not angry with me.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.600
I think he'll understand.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.920
And she will, too.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.560
My daemon, I mean.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.200
What if she settles for
something really bad like

20:19.200 --> 20:21.720
a mosquito or a slug?

20:21.720 --> 20:23.120
Or a fish?

20:23.120 --> 20:25.840
I heard of a man
whose daemon was a dolphin,

20:25.840 --> 20:27.280
but he's a sailor, so it's fine.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.120
Yeah, imagine me
walking around Oxford

20:29.120 --> 20:30.360
with a dolphin in my hand.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.040
THEY CHUCKLE

20:34.440 --> 20:35.560
You'll figure it out.

20:59.640 --> 21:00.920
Oh-ho!

21:00.920 --> 21:04.520
Do you find it hard to answer
Dr Malone's questions?

21:04.520 --> 21:08.080
It seems impossible to explain
what we've been through.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.480
I don't think anyone
can understand.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.760
Apart from you.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.600
SPLASHING

21:19.440 --> 21:21.600
She's great, isn't she?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.280
Mary Malone? Yeah.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.240
I really like her.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.800
I think she's right about...

21:31.280 --> 21:33.400
..a lot of things.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.040
Yeah?

21:35.040 --> 21:36.320
What things?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.480
Erm...

21:39.480 --> 21:40.680
You know.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.760
Dust.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.240
And, erm, trees.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.200
Trees?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.560
Dust and trees.

22:04.200 --> 22:07.080
SPIDER DAEMON:  Lyra.
Eve herself.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.920
Imagine how blessed I shall be

22:10.920 --> 22:14.040
when I succeed
where others have failed.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.720
Praise be to the Authority.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.120
BALTHAMOS: Stop!

22:22.880 --> 22:24.640
RUSTLING

22:24.640 --> 22:25.960
Who are you?

22:28.520 --> 22:31.240
What are you?

22:31.240 --> 22:32.720
An angel.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.480
We are on the same side.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.160
No. We are not.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.720
Come closer.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.680
I am your servant.

22:51.160 --> 22:55.000
Let me perform
this act of devotion,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.760
and you'll see.

22:56.760 --> 23:00.520
What I'm about to do
will rid the world of sin.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.080
Desire is not sin.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.520
Love takes a million forms -

23:06.520 --> 23:08.160
each of them beautiful,

23:08.160 --> 23:11.000
each of them worthy.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.280
You who judge,

23:13.280 --> 23:15.080
you're just afraid.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.520
I am Balthamos

23:30.520 --> 23:33.440
and I will not let you take
an innocent child's life!

23:47.040 --> 23:48.640
Baruch...

23:53.960 --> 23:55.800
DUST RUSTLES

24:00.440 --> 24:02.480
LEAVES RUSTLE

24:39.480 --> 24:41.000
Will...

25:28.800 --> 25:31.760
Is it Lyra and Will?  Yes.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.720
The flow of Dust is slowing down.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.320
Then the prophecy
has been fulfilled.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.480
The love of Eve
shall heal the Earth,

25:42.480 --> 25:44.080
and all the world shall feel it.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.000
Nature will be restored.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.440
Hope will spark in darkness.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.280
As innocence turns to experience,

26:02.280 --> 26:05.320
all will be in harmony once more.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.240
They did this.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.600
We can go anywhere.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.080
We can go to any world we want.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.200
Or we could just stay here.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.600
Do you think Pan knows?

27:09.480 --> 27:10.840
I think he guessed.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.600
We'll have to go back to our worlds
for a bit, won't we?

27:16.920 --> 27:19.320
So that they'll be OK.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.480
I want to show you Jordan.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.280
Proper Oxford.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.160
THEY CHUCKLE

27:28.160 --> 27:29.640
We can go to yours, too.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.000
Go to the cinema again.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.360
SQUAWKING

27:54.320 --> 27:56.880
HE SNIFFS It's Serafina Pekkala.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.880
Have you seen
how the world is changing?

28:00.280 --> 28:03.240
It's all thanks to you
and your humans.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.360
One who has given the world
such a gift deserves a name.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.600
Kirjava.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.000
Kirjava?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.480
It suits you.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.400
Why aren't you with Will and Lyra?

28:19.160 --> 28:21.920
Are you still punishing them
for their betrayal?

28:21.920 --> 28:24.440
But you love them still, don't you?

28:24.440 --> 28:25.840
And you are not severed.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.680
No.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.800
We're still one.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.560
But it was so painful.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.880
They will need you
for what is to come.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.760
SNIFFING

29:20.960 --> 29:22.360
Pan.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.600
You left me.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.440
I've had to travel so far
to find you again.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.800
I'm so sorry.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.280
I'm so grateful.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.840
I didn't want to.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.880
I'm sorry.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.480
Please...

29:44.480 --> 29:46.040
Please. I'm sorry.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.960
I've missed you.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.000
I love you.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.400
Lyra...

29:57.960 --> 30:00.920
I hoped you'd settle
as a pine marten.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.240
It suits you.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.160
I like it, too.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.360
I'm...

30:23.400 --> 30:24.800
..Kirjava.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.960
SHE PURRS

30:28.960 --> 30:30.560
Kirjava.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.040
FAINT WHOOSHING

31:01.160 --> 31:03.120
XAPHANIA: You played
the serpent well.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.280
Hello.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.720
I am Xaphania.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.000
And I'm grateful to you
beyond words.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.960
I'm sorry, do...

31:35.960 --> 31:37.600
Do I know you?

31:37.600 --> 31:39.640
We spoke in your laboratory.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.760
I've been watching you
and guiding you.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.000
You've been so brave
to come this far.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.640
Thanks to you,
the multiverse is healing.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.200
I barely did anything.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.480
You showed two innocents
what it was to dare.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.240
And by discovering their love,

31:59.240 --> 32:04.160
they have drawn Dust
back into our worlds.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.360
Is that really all it took?

32:07.920 --> 32:11.520
Something so small and ordinary?

32:13.040 --> 32:18.120
Love is never small to those that
discover it for the first time.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.200
Your task is now complete.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.960
The time has come for you...

32:30.400 --> 32:31.800
..to go home.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.320
Home?

32:37.120 --> 32:38.400
I'm not ready.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.440
XAPHANIA: For centuries,

32:44.440 --> 32:47.240
Dust has been flowing
out of the universe.

32:47.240 --> 32:50.840
What Lyra and Will have done
has turned that tide.

32:52.960 --> 32:56.880
But their love alone is not
enough to sustain it forever.

33:00.360 --> 33:04.280
Every window that exists
must be closed.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.000
Every window I've opened,
I've closed.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.520
There are countless more -

33:07.520 --> 33:10.760
windows left open by all the bearers
that have ever been.

33:10.760 --> 33:13.880
Each time the knife makes a cut,

33:13.880 --> 33:16.720
the flow of Dust increases.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.800
And from the tear in the space
between worlds,

33:20.800 --> 33:22.920
some darkness is released,

33:22.920 --> 33:26.200
bringing destruction
across all of the worlds.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.200
It can take the form of many things.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.960
A plague.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.240
A Spectre.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.800
I've been making Spectres?

33:38.840 --> 33:41.280
But if Will can't use the knife

33:41.280 --> 33:43.040
and if we can't leave
the windows open,

33:43.040 --> 33:45.200
then how will we...?

33:50.800 --> 33:52.560
We have to choose worlds?

33:53.840 --> 33:55.440
Will's or mine?

33:55.440 --> 33:57.840
You can't live in
someone else's world for long.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.600
Our daemons won't survive.

34:07.160 --> 34:11.200
It means we can't stay
in the same world together.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.400
No.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.760
You can't come here
and just say that.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.640
After everything
we've been through, it's not fair.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.280
It's not fair.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.600
I'll ask the alethiometer.
It'll know what to do.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.360
I don't know what's happening.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.400
It's not working.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.160
Don't rush.

35:12.600 --> 35:13.760
Just breathe, OK?

35:20.680 --> 35:22.080
It's broken.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.000
Come back!

35:27.000 --> 35:28.880
SERAFINA: It's not broken, Lyra.

35:28.880 --> 35:31.480
You've changed.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.880
You've grown up.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.600
So that's it?

35:34.600 --> 35:37.080
I will never be able
to read it again?

35:37.080 --> 35:39.560
The knowledge still exists,
but you'll have to learn it,

35:39.560 --> 35:41.360
like those before you.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.320
You read it by grace,

35:43.320 --> 35:44.960
and you can regain it by work.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.200
What's the point?

35:48.200 --> 35:49.560
Why did we get here?

35:50.920 --> 35:53.000
Why did we go through
everything we went through

35:53.000 --> 35:54.320
just to be forced apart?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.560
I didn't know it was possible
to feel this bad.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.520
It won't always feel like this.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.760
I don't want to not feel
like this about Lyra.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.280
I only want her.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.040
You're a witch.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.960
You must know some spell or some...

36:16.960 --> 36:19.720
Some way to travel between worlds.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.640
I'm meant to be with him.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.200
This is all wrong!

36:25.840 --> 36:28.200
You know all those stories that say

36:28.200 --> 36:31.160
the greatest love is the one
that you can't live without...

36:32.840 --> 36:34.600
..the one that you're prepared
to die for?

36:36.520 --> 36:37.760
That's not right.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.840
That's not what love is.

36:42.840 --> 36:45.160
I know it seems romantic
to die for love,

36:45.160 --> 36:47.160
but it's much more romantic
to live for it.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.920
You will never lose
what you have with Will.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.480
You've shaped each other forever.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.840
And I know
it doesn't seem like it now,

36:55.840 --> 36:57.480
but you have a future, Lyra.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.600
SHE SOBS

37:27.640 --> 37:30.880
XAPHANIA: It is a great gift
that you have given.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.880
But Dust continues
to flow out of the worlds.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.640
Time is running out.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.760
If humanity set their minds
to discovery

37:42.760 --> 37:44.480
and their hearts to compassion,

37:44.480 --> 37:47.080
they may create enough Dust

37:47.080 --> 37:49.840
for a single opening to remain.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.600
But you already know
where that window must be.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.000
The land of the dead.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.680
We can't close that window.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.520
It's the most important one.

38:07.720 --> 38:08.960
Ghosts need it.

38:10.360 --> 38:15.840
And, now, the rest of the windows
must be closed.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.880
But how are there so many?

38:17.880 --> 38:21.840
While the knife exists,
only you can close them.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.240
Break the knife,

38:24.240 --> 38:25.880
and we can help you.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.920
I have to break the knife?

38:31.920 --> 38:33.440
Yes.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.840
Once you've returned to your home,

38:35.840 --> 38:37.680
when it is broken,

38:37.680 --> 38:41.240
we angels will seal the wounds.

38:41.240 --> 38:45.600
The worlds will be whole
and unique once more.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.840
If there's any way we can be
together, just tell us now.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.200
I'm sorry.

38:51.640 --> 38:54.680
There are fates
even the most powerful

38:54.680 --> 38:56.400
have to submit to.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.680
I love you.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.520
I'm not going to stop
loving you till the day I die.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.280
I love you.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.240
We will come back here, though.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.800
When we've lived our lives.

39:59.800 --> 40:02.360
We'll go through
the land of the dead...

40:03.920 --> 40:06.960
..and we'll tell Gracious Wings
everything we've done.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.520
And we'll find each other...

40:09.520 --> 40:10.880
..here.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.560
I'll be drifting about...

40:18.000 --> 40:19.400
..until I find you.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.880
And I'll be searching for you.

40:25.640 --> 40:26.840
Every moment.

40:28.440 --> 40:30.120
Every single moment.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.360
When we do find each other again...

40:39.680 --> 40:42.160
..no-one will be able
to tear us apart.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.120
We'll be joined so tightly.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.240
Every atom of me...

40:53.080 --> 40:55.040
..and every atom of you.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.080
And when they use our atoms
to make new lives...

41:04.000 --> 41:05.720
..they'll have to take two.

41:08.760 --> 41:12.160
One for you and one for me.

41:18.400 --> 41:21.080
We'll be in the flowers
and in the sunbeams.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.880
We'll be joined so tight...

42:01.000 --> 42:03.800
MULEFA TRUMPET

42:23.520 --> 42:25.640
We'll come with you.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.160
Atal, you can't.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.800
BABY MULEFA TRUMPETS

43:32.560 --> 43:34.320
Once all the windows are closed,

43:34.320 --> 43:37.480
each of the worlds
will be properly aligned.

43:37.480 --> 43:39.280
But for now, Will,

43:39.280 --> 43:41.600
Lyra's Oxford should be here.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.920
PIERCING

45:08.120 --> 45:09.880
BIRDSONG

45:09.880 --> 45:11.920
CLOISTER BELL RINGS

45:18.480 --> 45:20.400
You will look after Lyra, won't you?

45:21.720 --> 45:23.840
She has a lot of courage,

45:23.840 --> 45:27.520
but I think this will be
very hard for her.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.000
I shall.

45:33.080 --> 45:36.120
She'll be my sister now, forever.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.200
At least Will has Kirjava.

45:45.560 --> 45:48.520
You know, you could see
your daemon, too,

45:48.520 --> 45:49.840
if you wanted.

45:52.520 --> 45:55.000
When you spoke to the angels
in your cave,

45:55.000 --> 45:57.920
you held yourself
in a special state of mind.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.080
Like when Lyra read
her alethiometer.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.680
Exactly.

46:01.680 --> 46:05.400
We all see
only what we expect to see.

46:06.800 --> 46:10.960
You only saw Dust when
you believed you were able to.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.360
Try it.

46:27.120 --> 46:28.880
SHE EXHALES

46:48.000 --> 46:49.440
SHE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

47:01.480 --> 47:03.240
There you are.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.160
We can come back here every year.

47:17.560 --> 47:21.320
You in your world and me in mine.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.280
Midsummer's Day.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.760
Midday.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.440
And I'll be there.

47:34.280 --> 47:36.320
I'll be there every year.

47:36.320 --> 47:37.800
My whole life.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.000
And if we do meet someone we like...

47:44.600 --> 47:46.080
..we must be kind to them.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.000
We won't compare them.

47:51.920 --> 47:55.440
When we come here,
just for an hour...

47:58.120 --> 47:59.400
..we can be together.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.840
Every year.

48:02.840 --> 48:04.160
I promise.

48:16.120 --> 48:17.440
Just do it.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.080
SLICING

48:36.640 --> 48:38.160
I'll never forget you.

48:47.400 --> 48:49.480
I'll break the knife
as soon as I'm through,

48:49.480 --> 48:52.440
because I know I'll just want
to come back to you.

48:59.760 --> 49:01.240
What is it?

49:01.240 --> 49:02.680
I'm just trying to imagine

49:02.680 --> 49:04.520
what you'll look like
when you're old.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.240
THEY CHUCKLE

49:07.720 --> 49:09.080
Handsome, of course.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.240
Very.

49:28.520 --> 49:30.120
Lyra...

49:30.120 --> 49:31.800
Will...

49:56.320 --> 49:57.800
PAN SQUEAKS

50:20.800 --> 50:23.120
Just think of her.

51:01.320 --> 51:04.120
FAINT WHOOSHING

51:12.560 --> 51:14.680
GATE CREAKS

51:23.600 --> 51:25.800
SNIFFING

51:28.040 --> 51:29.440
HE GRUNTS SOFTLY

52:15.640 --> 52:17.720
MUFFLED KNOCKING

53:11.520 --> 53:13.800
BELL RINGS

53:21.520 --> 53:23.560
BELL RINGS

53:55.440 --> 53:57.320
LYRA: We can come back here
every year.

53:59.320 --> 54:03.360
You in your world and me in mine.

54:05.680 --> 54:07.200
And we can be together.

54:08.960 --> 54:10.200
I'll be there every year.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.760
My whole life.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.320
I promise.

54:47.640 --> 54:49.000
Lyra.
