WEBVTT

00:17.350 --> 00:19.227
Two number threes
with Diet Cokes?

00:19.310 --> 00:20.937
-Oh, yeah. Thanks.
-Sure.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.065
-Could I have my change, please?

00:24.149 --> 00:26.359
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.504
-Here's your burgers.
-Yeah. Please let me
ride up front with you.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.757
-Here's your drink.
Here's your change.
-Okay.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.967
Oh my god. Thanks.
Look, can I at least

00:51.050 --> 00:52.886
-eat the sandwich
before we take off?
-We gotta go.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.846
-No, no, no.
-Wait, the food is gonna
fly all over the--

00:54.929 --> 00:57.474
We gotta go! Got big plans!

01:03.104 --> 01:04.439
Yeah, I just...

01:04.522 --> 01:07.025
I wanna make sure that
we fully understand, like,

01:07.108 --> 01:09.736
why Chloe decides to leave Zach.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.321
I think it's
pretty clear.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.282
Are you worried it'll appear
like we have an agenda?

01:14.365 --> 01:15.950
No, not an agenda.
Just, like,

01:16.034 --> 01:18.077
needs to be, like, complex
and gray, you know?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.954
And right now,
it just reads like...

01:20.038 --> 01:22.415
I don't know.
Like her dialogue is...

01:22.499 --> 01:23.917
People just don't talk
like that, you know?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.586
Like in perfectly
worded arguments.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.379
I would disagree
with that assumption.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.299
Her naivetÃ© is a direct result
of the history of subjugation

01:31.382 --> 01:33.593
of women by
a draconian patriarchy.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.222
Right...

01:37.305 --> 01:39.390
Maybe we throw
a few "um's" in there?

01:39.474 --> 01:41.184
Oh my god...

01:41.267 --> 01:43.311
How do you know
to do all this?

01:43.394 --> 01:46.064
Writing? Oh!
It's easy.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.191
You know, you just, um...

01:48.274 --> 01:50.652
follow your instincts
and keep it honest.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.987
-You know, just like
when you're acting.
-Yeah, I'm...

01:53.071 --> 01:56.157
I'm actually, like,
working on some personal stuff.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.910
Like, um, kind of a show.
It's like coming of age,

01:58.993 --> 02:00.203
but set in space.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.163
-I don't know, but...
-Sally!

02:02.247 --> 02:03.748
-Barry?
-Hey!

02:03.832 --> 02:06.209
Hi. I-- Wait...

02:06.292 --> 02:08.920
I'm forgetting.
Did I ask you to come?

02:09.003 --> 02:10.255
No, I came on my own.

02:10.338 --> 02:13.174
-Oh... Hi!
-Hey!

02:13.258 --> 02:14.384
Hey. Listen,

02:14.467 --> 02:15.593
I know how to get Cousineau

02:15.677 --> 02:17.178
over the murder
of his girlfriend.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.638
You cast him on your show.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.849
What...

02:20.932 --> 02:22.725
I... What? Wait, y--

02:22.809 --> 02:26.271
-You talked to Cousineau?
-Uh, yeah.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.190
Yeah, and, um, you know,
he's still pretty fucked up,

02:29.274 --> 02:31.651
but I think getting his,
um, you know,

02:31.734 --> 02:33.778
career back on track will make
him a little less fucked up

02:33.862 --> 02:35.029
and give him a purpose.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.823
Oh, that's so sweet.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.908
But we threw his name out for
a part and casting said no.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.995
I think the direct quote was,
"life's too short."

02:42.078 --> 02:44.372
Well, wait, aren't you the boss?
Can't you override that?

02:44.455 --> 02:46.541
Yeah, I am the boss,
which is why I need to trust

02:46.624 --> 02:47.917
that I hired smart people,

02:48.001 --> 02:50.628
and casting said
he's a shitshow. So...

02:51.838 --> 02:53.882
-He's not a shitshow.
-Yeah, I know. Look,

02:53.965 --> 02:55.758
I was as surprised as you are,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.136
but the town wants
nothing to do with him.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.762
He's made his bed, so...

02:59.846 --> 03:01.890
Hey, you know, I'm kind of in
the middle of something here,

03:01.973 --> 03:03.808
so can we talk
about this at home?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.018
He's in a lot of pain.

03:05.101 --> 03:08.354
Yeah. No,
I am sorry to hear that.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.606
-No, you're not.
-What?

03:09.689 --> 03:12.150
If you actually felt that way,
you'd do something about it,

03:12.233 --> 03:13.651
but you're not doing
anything about it.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.194
So now, I have to do
something about it.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.489
I came here for your help,
and you're not giving it to me.

03:20.450 --> 03:24.287
Are you okay?
'Cause you seem
a little manic.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.164
-I'm worried about him.
-So am I.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.333
Which is why I tried
to get him on my show.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.667
We're saying the same thing.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.962
We are not saying
the same thing!

03:33.046 --> 03:34.797
We are not
saying the same thing!

03:34.881 --> 03:37.258
If I don't do this,
I don't live!

03:37.342 --> 03:41.471
I have to do this
to fucking live!

03:41.554 --> 03:43.890
-Don't fucking laugh at me!

03:43.973 --> 03:47.644
My whole life!
My whole... fucking life!

03:47.727 --> 03:50.271
-Barry...
-I need you to do
this for me now!

03:50.355 --> 03:51.814
Now!

03:53.524 --> 03:55.610
Do it.

03:55.693 --> 03:59.322
-Okay. I see... you're
very upset right now.
-Do it!

03:59.405 --> 04:03.284
Look, I-I-I'm sorry.
I tried, and...

04:03.368 --> 04:06.287
-I... I can't.
-Shit.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.185
-Hello?
-Hey-hey.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.979
Are you around to meet up?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.649
Yes. Um...

04:34.732 --> 04:36.943
-What time were you thinking?
-Now!

04:37.026 --> 04:39.028
NoHo Hank
Right. Duh.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.572
You know, I really wish you
would trust one of my guys

04:41.656 --> 04:43.157
to bring you these
heroin plants,

04:43.241 --> 04:44.867
but since I'm the only
one you trust,

04:44.951 --> 04:46.327
you know? Just...

04:46.411 --> 04:48.371
-sucks that you live all
the way in Calabasas.
-Hi!

04:48.454 --> 04:52.000
-I mean, that is a drive.
-Say I live in the Redlands.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.043
Redlands?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.337
Fuck me!

04:56.421 --> 04:58.256
Wow.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.508
I am so fucked today.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.886
I will not be coming back
to this office anytime soon.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.306
Okay. I'll see you later.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.603
-Are you selling limonada?
-Yeah.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.605
-Oh, how much?
-One dollar!

05:14.689 --> 05:16.774
Fantastic. I'll take two.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.673
Don't pull on the door!

05:40.757 --> 05:42.383
Let me unlock first!

05:47.221 --> 05:48.931
Pendejo.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.020
-Mi yerno.
-Suegro.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.192
Did you just come all
the way from Bolivia?

05:59.275 --> 06:01.027
Yes.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.821
But, not in this.
It's a rental.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.366
We flew.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.455
Gene Cousineau
Barry? Barry,

06:12.538 --> 06:14.916
I've been in this trunk
way too long.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.169
I can't feel my legs!
A-and, you might not know this,

06:18.252 --> 06:21.172
but that is definitely
a stroke symptom!

06:21.255 --> 06:24.634
-You're going to have to relax.
-What are you doing?

06:24.717 --> 06:27.220
Plan A didn't work,
so I'm gonna have to do plan B.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.138
Do you even know
what the plan is?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.057
I don't know what the plan is!

06:31.140 --> 06:33.476
Look, I'm trying to fucking
help you, man, alright?

06:33.559 --> 06:36.354
-So, just shut up!
-Where you going?

06:36.437 --> 06:38.231
Uh, Allison Jones' office,
please.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.610
We were all just a little
confused though. I mean,

06:42.693 --> 06:45.238
you read for "Swim Instructors,"
you were really good.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.031
We liked you. Jay liked you.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.826
-Who?
-Jay.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.119
The director.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.121
-Oh, Jay Roach. Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.331
But then, um,
we couldn't find you.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.126
You didn't return any calls,
and we left messages.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.170
-We left word, we couldn't--
You never called us back.
-Right.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.882
-No, uh, something came up.
-Right. Well, it's cast now.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.844
They went with Adam DeVine
and Josh Gad.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.471
Two short guys. Never,
ever, ever going to work.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.015
Not funny. I don't know
why they think it is.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.435
-Right... Well, it's, um,
I'm not really here for me.
-Yeah.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.272
Uh, I was wondering
if you could, um,

07:19.355 --> 07:21.649
-get my acting teacher
some work.
-Mm-hmm.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.443
Uh, his name is Gene Cousineau.
He's been around--

07:24.527 --> 07:26.821
Oh, Gene Cousineau's
a fucking asshole.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.239
I won't have anything
to do with him.

07:28.322 --> 07:31.033
He was awful to me.
No, thank you.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.161
But, you know what?
I like your intensity.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.414
You kind of have,
like, a not-present
Joaquin Phoenix thing.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.291
-Huh.
-We might have something
for you, actually,

07:38.374 --> 07:41.335
that you could be right for.
On the show
"Laws Of Humanity,"

07:41.419 --> 07:43.296
there's a great role,
Mr. Millaway.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.131
Can you come back at00
and read for that?

07:45.214 --> 07:46.340
-Me?
-Yeah.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.343
00. Different office.

07:49.427 --> 07:53.014
Good role.
I think you'd be great for it.
Yeah. Last slot.

08:40.519 --> 08:41.646
Cristobal!

08:41.729 --> 08:44.565
-Drink with me. Come on.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.364
This Airbnb is fantastic.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.533
They're fun, no?

08:54.617 --> 08:57.245
-Y-yeah. Yeah.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.790
Stop being so much fun!

09:00.873 --> 09:03.626
Uh, did Elena send you?

09:05.711 --> 09:07.296
My daughter misses her husband.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.340
And the niÃ±os,

09:09.423 --> 09:10.800
they...

09:10.883 --> 09:13.261
they need their daddy.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.639
I know you've had a hard time
establishing a foothold in LA.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.308
Minor setback.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.562
Chechens seem to be
a major setback.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.314
But not to worry.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.608
The cavalry is here.

09:27.692 --> 09:31.445
We will take them out.
Blood for blood.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.489
The sooner we can wipe out
these Russian farmers,

09:33.572 --> 09:36.075
the sooner we establish
our business.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.452
And you can go back home!

09:42.248 --> 09:43.874
Blood for blood.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.508
Assistant
Sally? Action on rehearsal.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.511
Sally, action on rehearsal.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.513
Oh. Um...

09:57.596 --> 09:59.724
You need to get out of this.
I think I'll...

09:59.807 --> 10:03.185
I think we'll cross this way,
if that's not totally weird.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.314
Um... Sorry. Yeah.
You need to get out of this.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.565
But, he apologized.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.234
That's why you're staying
in it, for the apology.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.361
-That's not a thing.
-Yes, it is.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.529
I did it with your father,

10:13.612 --> 10:16.115
and it was a pattern
I fell into.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.159
It took me years to
break it, but I did.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.119
And I just don't want...

10:20.202 --> 10:21.579
Fuck! What's my line?

10:21.662 --> 10:23.622
I don't want you to
make the same mistakes.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.166
Yeah, we gotta
change that.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.917
I just-- I say that
to her constantly.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.628
-Alright, let's set this up.
Cast can rest.
-Where's my script?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.385
Hey. Are, are you okay?

10:36.469 --> 10:39.347
Yeah. That was really scary.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.931
Yeah. Um,

10:41.015 --> 10:43.517
so, uh, we gotta
report that, right?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.895
Oh. Are you guys talking
about Sally's boyfriend?

10:45.978 --> 10:48.773
-I heard about that.
-Yeah, we were there.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.024
It was, like, terrifying.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.276
Who do we talk to about this?

10:52.360 --> 10:55.613
Well, he doesn't work here,
so we can't report it to HR.

10:55.696 --> 10:56.655
Did he hit her?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.450
-No. Um...
-Did he threaten her?

11:00.576 --> 11:02.161
Uh, no.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.372
Did he throw anything?

11:04.455 --> 11:07.333
Well
he had her pinned up
against the wall,

11:07.416 --> 11:09.251
and he was yelling at her.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.504
There's really nothing
we can do about that.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.673
I mean, he's clearly
a violent person.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.008
They're adults,

11:16.092 --> 11:17.843
and I like my job.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.765
Sucks that you had to see tha--

11:22.848 --> 11:24.683
-What, camera's ready?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.310
-We're ready for you on set.

11:33.609 --> 11:34.693
Okay...

11:39.490 --> 11:40.825
Apologize...

11:42.159 --> 11:43.702
So, let me get
this straight.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.039
You went in to get me a part,
and you got yourself a part?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.750
It's an audition.
I'm reading Mr. Millaway.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.669
You're a lawyer.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.463
You seriously want me to
interpret the scene for you?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.299
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind?

11:57.383 --> 12:00.803
Oh, just let me go, Barry.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.515
-Wait, you wouldn't
go to the cops?
-Of course not!

12:04.598 --> 12:07.184
You're a bad actor,
Mr. Cousineau.

12:07.268 --> 12:11.730
So, you're gonna hold me hostage
until you book me a part?

12:11.814 --> 12:12.982
That's not the way it works.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.193
We're talking about me here.
That could take years.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.572
Look, what I'm saying to you
is that your plan sucks.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.158
Look, I swear

12:22.241 --> 12:24.660
on Janice's soul,

12:24.743 --> 12:26.287
I will not say a word

12:26.370 --> 12:29.165
-to anyone--
-It's either this
or I kill you.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.754
You're one of
the good guys, Barry.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.259
You did a horrible thing.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.888
But I see your pain.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.474
It is the same pain that
you came to me with.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.268
Fresh out of the army.
A lost soul.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.980
No one to tell you your worth.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.525
I took you in.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.154
Not only did I teach you
to be a good actor,

13:00.237 --> 13:02.990
I taught you to be
a good human being.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.662
And this is how you repay me?

13:08.746 --> 13:10.789
By killing me?

13:20.549 --> 13:23.052
I love you, Mr. Cousineau.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.224
I appreciate that, Barry.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.228
Alright.
Well, look, we don't
have a lot of time. Uh,

13:32.311 --> 13:33.979
I was going through
my checklist in my head,

13:34.063 --> 13:36.065
and I think my guy's
issue is his ego.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.234
Like, he's one of
these big pharma guys.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.195
But, I think I can actually
make one of these guys likable.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.530
Hi.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.324
No, I'm just leaving.
Literally the worst date.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.035
I'm not exaggerating this time.
Okay.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.372
He ordered milk with dinner.
He-- Oh my--

14:00.673 --> 14:04.385
This thing has
14 cup holders.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.554
I counted.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.641
Madness.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.777
chatter continues)

14:26.657 --> 14:28.659
-Apaga la luce.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.342
Gangster
There's no one here.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.803
-Como que no one?

14:47.886 --> 14:49.805
-Seguro?
-Nada.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.647
-Look at the dinosaur! Look!
-Look! Dinosaur! Look!

14:58.731 --> 15:01.567
Dinosaur!
"Jurassic Park"!

15:06.697 --> 15:09.116
-Holy shit! Jimmy Kimmel!
-Where?

15:09.199 --> 15:10.242
-Right there!
-Yeah, Batir,

15:10.326 --> 15:11.785
that's where they do
the Jimmy Kimmel.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.413
-"The Man Show"
does not age well.
-Ah!

15:14.496 --> 15:16.915
No. Not a carbonara.
That's too fancy.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.209
Just, like,
a regular spaghetti.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.669
I mean, do you guys
have a kids menu?

15:20.753 --> 15:23.505
-Sally, Lindsay's
in your office.
-What? Lindsay?

15:23.589 --> 15:26.759
-Wait. What?
Did she say what for?
-Didn't say.

15:26.842 --> 15:31.138
-She's here.
-Oh. Okay. She just walked in.
I'll give her the lowdown.

15:31.221 --> 15:34.391
-Hey. What's up?
-Hey. That was
Casey over at Diane's office.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.018
-We have a situation.
-Ah...

15:36.101 --> 15:38.354
Apparently, there's
another show like yours.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.190
-What?
-It's called "Pam!"
With an exclamation mark.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.025
So, it's kinda
more like... Pam!

15:43.108 --> 15:44.485
-Who's in it?
-Alexis Kaplan.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.236
-She's a stand-up comedian.
-Who's that?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.739
-She is hysterical.
-Yeah. In the show,
she plays a woman

15:48.822 --> 15:50.366
who escapes an abusive
relationship

15:50.449 --> 15:52.993
-and has a daughter.
Wait, look at the glass!

15:53.077 --> 15:54.745
-It's so big!
-It's cute.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.205
She loves to drink.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.457
That's a show about abuse?

15:58.540 --> 15:59.625
You're mad? You're mad.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.377
So, Diane wants
to get ahead of it,

16:01.460 --> 16:02.961
so they're pulling
your release date up.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.089
-What? To when?
-Yeah. End of the week.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.383
Exciting! It's so exciting!

16:07.466 --> 16:09.218
I-I don't know how
I feel about this.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.678
So, we'll do
the premiere Thursday,

16:10.761 --> 16:12.179
and you have to do
a press junket.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.931
-When?
-Tomorrow.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.724
-It's happening tomorrow?
-So, let's sit down...

16:15.808 --> 16:19.103
-...we can talk strategy.
-I gotta go pick up
some spaghetti.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.230
We do-- We should talk
about it right now

16:21.313 --> 16:24.191
-because it is tomorrow.
-But she needs
to get spaghetti.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.836
-Be right back!

16:48.132 --> 16:50.509
Apologize? Are you nuts?

16:50.592 --> 16:52.761
I'm not the type of man
to admit my wrongs.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.388
I've already paid the family.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.390
Casting
I need you to not only
look inside your wallet,

16:56.473 --> 16:59.101
but your soul.
It's part of the settlement.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.396
To apologize? What kind
of law practice is this?

17:02.479 --> 17:05.733
A law practice whose goal
is to eradicate meanness.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.194
Wait. That's you guys?

17:12.364 --> 17:15.701
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah. Thanks, Barry.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.244
Uh, when will
I know if I got it?

17:17.327 --> 17:19.204
Uh, work's tomorrow,
so soon.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.459
I really need this job.

17:23.542 --> 17:27.004
I know, everyone does.
We'll get back to you, okay?

17:27.087 --> 17:30.048
You have that part,
the sad old man whose wife dies,

17:30.132 --> 17:31.341
have you cast that yet?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.594
Doesn't have any lines.
That's just gonna be an extra.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.222
I need you to cast
my acting teacher.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.725
-There's a process here--
-His name is Gene Cousineau.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.560
Gene Cousineau?
That's your acting teacher?

17:41.643 --> 17:42.978
That the guy that
brought the loaded gun

17:43.061 --> 17:44.438
-to the "Full House" audition?
-Yeah.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.106
When Allison didn't cast
him on "Family Ties,"

17:46.190 --> 17:48.025
he called her
a donkey witch.

17:48.108 --> 17:51.069
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.280
That's not how it works.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.246
When I met Mr. Cousineau...

18:02.456 --> 18:04.124
I was a lost soul.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.919
I was just out of the Marines.
I didn't have anybody.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.673
He didn't just
teach me how to...

18:11.757 --> 18:13.675
be a better actor, but...

18:13.759 --> 18:16.512
he taught me how to
be a human being.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.098
He saved my life.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.780
Oh my god.
Thank God you're okay.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.537
What the fuck is going on?
Who's Fernando?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.372
Why the fuck is Fernando
trying to kill us?

18:43.455 --> 18:46.250
-I mean--
-Fernando is the head
of our family, Hank.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.628
He brought his elite soldiers.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.171
Las Aguilas.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.302
You don't stand a chance.
You need to run.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.347
Run?

19:00.430 --> 19:03.600
Come on, we don't
run away from anyone.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.686
-Let me talk to him, okay?
-Fuck, man,

19:05.769 --> 19:08.188
you're not listening
to me, Hank.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.066
You don't talk to him!
No one talks to him!

19:11.149 --> 19:12.776
You'll die.

19:13.735 --> 19:14.987
I couldn't handle that.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.908
Wait, like, are you
breaking up with me?

19:21.535 --> 19:23.120
Goodbye.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.165
Enriquito.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.936
Oh, you know,
me and Don Felder...

19:49.980 --> 19:52.357
...especially the drums,
we wanted it to be very wet...

20:11.168 --> 20:13.462
Okay, okay, okay...

20:23.013 --> 20:24.973
Okay...

20:25.057 --> 20:26.892
"Connect to Bluetooth"?

20:26.975 --> 20:28.685
How the fuck do you do that?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.731
Barry? Hey.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.650
-I got a part!

20:34.733 --> 20:37.736
Wh-- For your controller?
No, no, I-I got you a new one.

20:37.819 --> 20:41.406
No! No, like a part
on a TV show!
"Laws of Humanity."

20:41.490 --> 20:43.116
Wait, what?

20:43.200 --> 20:46.078
Oh my god! That's, like...

20:46.161 --> 20:48.080
That's like a huge fucking show!

20:48.163 --> 20:49.915
Like, a real show! Congrats!

20:49.998 --> 20:51.625
Yeah, I got Cousineau
a part, too!

20:51.708 --> 20:53.126
Oh my god, so you did it.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.087
-How?
-I told Ben, the casting guy,

20:55.170 --> 20:56.838
our story,
and he was really moved.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.007
His exact words were,
"That is fucking clean

20:59.091 --> 21:01.677
-and rad and beautiful, bro."
-Oh my god.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.846
I can't believe he said rad.
They never say stuff like that.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.225
That is just...
That is so wonderful,
Boo Bear. I mean,

21:08.308 --> 21:11.937
-we should-- we should
celebrate. Okay.
-Yeah, I'll be home soon.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.440
Yeah. Hey, listen. I, um...

21:15.524 --> 21:18.986
Uh, I texted you
a lot earlier.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.904
Oh, I haven't-- I haven't
been near my phone.

21:20.988 --> 21:24.574
Oh, yeah. No, that's okay.
Um, I just, uh, I actually...

21:24.658 --> 21:27.577
I wanted to apologize. I...

21:27.661 --> 21:29.871
I was-- I've just
been under so much stress,

21:29.955 --> 21:31.957
and then you came to my office,
and I was just thrown,

21:32.040 --> 21:34.793
-and I-I'm really sorry.
-Oh, it's okay.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.213
Okay.

21:38.296 --> 21:40.841
Uh... Wait, are you okay?

21:40.924 --> 21:42.676
Yeah.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.219
Okay.

21:44.302 --> 21:46.179
-Are you happy?
-Yeah. I gotta go.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.057
-Okay. I just-- I really
want you to be happy, okay?
-Okay, byeee!

21:49.141 --> 21:52.060
-Okay. I love you! Love you.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.274
Mr. Cousineau! Guess what?

22:03.238 --> 22:05.407
Ho... Ho!

22:36.146 --> 22:38.356
I-I did not see this coming.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.692
I felt like things were
going really well.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.741
I just...

22:47.824 --> 22:51.203
I don't understand why you
don't want to be with me.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.247
I mean, it's been
five amazing years.

23:05.717 --> 23:09.596
I'm working on myself and you
seem to be appreciating that.

23:09.679 --> 23:13.391
No? I mean, I don't understand
why you're leaving me.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.477
You have too many dogs.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.646
-Who?
-You!

23:17.729 --> 23:19.439
-Me?
-Yes!

23:26.029 --> 23:27.531
Shit.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.116
Fuck.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.129
Excuse me, little girl,
I really need your help.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.505
Oh my god. Are you okay?

23:43.588 --> 23:46.758
I'm being chased by a man
who killed my girlfriend.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.426
-Oh my god.
-Yeah, and now,

23:48.510 --> 23:52.222
he's trying to make up for it
by getting me a job
on a TV show.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.517
Right...

23:55.600 --> 23:56.977
I don't have my phone.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.563
Could you please call me
an internet taxi?

24:01.064 --> 24:03.066
-Is that your dog?

24:03.150 --> 24:06.653
Oh, no. That's just one
of the 30 that mauled me.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.947
-Mm-hmm. Uh...

24:09.030 --> 24:11.408
Okay. It looks like there's
one right around the corner.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.326
You are an angel!

24:13.410 --> 24:14.619
Okay. Good luck.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.538
No, no, no!
Please, don't leave me.
I can't be alone.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.748
-No, I have to go to work.
-I-I'm a good person.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.208
I wanted to live.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.128
So, I ate his sandwiches
in the trunk.

24:23.211 --> 24:26.006
-Oh! That's your car. That one.
-Yeah?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.875
-Leo!

25:01.958 --> 25:04.044
-L-Leo!
-Jesus, Dad,
what happened to you?

25:04.127 --> 25:05.503
-Call the police.
-W-what do you mean?

25:05.587 --> 25:07.255
-No, no, no. Listen to me!
-Oh my god, a doggy!

25:07.339 --> 25:09.424
-I want you to--
-Barry, here's your tea.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.263
Oh, Dad,
you like you got, like,

25:15.347 --> 25:16.890
hit by a bus.

25:16.973 --> 25:20.310
Something... Something
happen to you two?

25:20.393 --> 25:21.895
No, your dad was helping me
with an audition,

25:21.978 --> 25:24.648
and we both, uh, committed
a little too hard.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.485
Uh, you said something
about the police?

25:28.568 --> 25:30.403
No.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.113
Okay, cool.

25:54.469 --> 25:57.639
I told that casting
director our story,

25:57.722 --> 26:00.600
and he was so moved...

26:00.684 --> 26:02.560
that he gave us both parts.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.022
So, you're going to enjoy

26:06.106 --> 26:08.275
everything that comes

26:08.358 --> 26:10.527
with being given
a second chance.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.196
Because if you don't...

26:14.197 --> 26:15.991
this one...

26:16.074 --> 26:17.701
and that one...

26:18.451 --> 26:20.829
go away.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.539
Do you understand?
