00:22.606 --> 00:24.892
Why are Warrior Angel
and Black Diamond ﬁghting?

00:25.067 --> 00:27.433
I mean, they're friends,
it doesn't make any sense.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.476
Didn't you read issue 126?

00:29.655 --> 00:32.943
No, I didn't have any money that week.
Why? What happened?

00:33.117 --> 00:36.701
So you know how Black Diamond's father
is like this super villain, right?

00:36.870 --> 00:40.533
Well, in 126, he busts out of jail
and Warrior Angel has to take him down.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.951
But there's this accident
and the guy dies and--

00:49.717 --> 00:51.628
Look who it is, boys.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.633
Weirdo Angel and his trusty sidekick,
Greaspa.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.923
Greaspa, I like that.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.724
Give it back, Ollie.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.727
That's Mr. Queen to you, little man.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.981
It's okay, Lex. I'll just get another one.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.518
Yeah, Duncan will just get another one.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.483
Oh, wait, he can't.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.280
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:15.451 --> 01:17.612
His mommy doesn't have any money.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.910
That's why he's on a scholarship.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.742
Shut up, Geoffrey. Shut up, Alden.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.407
Give it back...

01:26.503 --> 01:28.004
...Mr. Queen.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.919
You know what?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.675
-Let's make this a two-parter.
-Don't—

01:41.018 --> 01:42.508
Nice haircut, cue ball.

01:47.691 --> 01:51.149
Come on,
these girls aren't even worth it.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.190
Loser.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.786
One day I'm gonna get those guys.

02:19.807 --> 02:23.015
We had a stuffed crow
at Smallville High.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.558
Two different worlds, huh?

02:25.270 --> 02:28.387
In this case, I think I prefer yours.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.689
If that's how you feel,
why come to this thing?

02:34.863 --> 02:38.481
Lana, some of the deepest pockets
in the country went to Excelsior.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.366
These alumni socials
are good for business.

02:41.537 --> 02:45.325
Well, then let's be social,
so we can get the hell out of here.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.989
Lana.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.907
Your billionaire drag you to this too?

02:49.920 --> 02:50.909
Oliver's here?

02:51.088 --> 02:54.330
I don't get it. You put a bunch
of pubescent boys in silly jackets...

02:54.508 --> 02:56.749
...and cram them full of pomp
and circumstance...

02:56.927 --> 02:59.259
...you're asking for a round
of Lord of the Flies.

02:59.429 --> 03:03.172
I don't know. We all turned out all right.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.518
-Didn't we?
-Hey.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.432
I can only speak for myself.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.770
-Geoffrey. Alden.
-Lex.

03:18.949 --> 03:22.282
-How's business?
-Not as good as you, but hey.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.199
And you guys were all friends?

03:26.999 --> 03:28.079
Something like that.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.241
Man, after 10 years.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.537
-The gang's all here.
-Except for Duncan.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.303
Who's Duncan?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.430
You know what,
maybe you ought to lay off, huh?

03:45.601 --> 03:47.967
-What, you weren't all thinking about it?
-Alden.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.136
Alden, come on.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.475
Yeah, whatever.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.481
Good to see you, Lex.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.523
You did all right for yourself.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.951
Duncan, if you were here...

04:14.129 --> 04:15.835
...you'd still be a loser.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.208
Oh, my God.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.261
-You all right?
-ltjust missed me.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.181
Must be my lucky day.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.081
I heard what happened.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.052
Are you all right, son?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.926
Nothing a little dry cleaning won't cure.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.682
That's distasteful, Lex.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.263
Even for you.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.721
Well, what can I say?

05:57.399 --> 05:58.388
It's a nice suit.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.569
You weren't Alden's close friend,
Lex, but still--

06:04.740 --> 06:06.776
I should muster up some tears anyway?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.776
Thanks, I'll save them for someone
who deserves it.

06:13.290 --> 06:17.454
I know, I know.
Your life at Excelsior wasn't easy.

06:19.588 --> 06:23.581
And I know that memories can haunt us...

06:23.759 --> 06:26.796
...but the best way to deal with them
is to leave them behind us.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.803
Bury them where they belong...

06:29.973 --> 06:31.634
...in the past.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.605
Along with everything else.

06:40.776 --> 06:41.982
Right, Dad?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.607
I'm glad you're all right.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.485
-If you need anything--
-I won't.

06:57.959 --> 07:01.417
Perhaps Miss Lang will have better luck
comforting you.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.705
Would you give her my regards, please?

07:26.696 --> 07:30.063
-What are you gonna do when you get out?
-I don't know. College, I guess.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.231
Then what?

07:31.409 --> 07:34.116
My dad wants me to learn
how to run his business.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.663
Are you gonna do it?

07:36.206 --> 07:37.912
Hell, no.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.866
I can't stand that old bastard.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.666
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.002
I'm gonna help people,
like Warrior Angel.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.878
Better hit the gym.
Spandex is tough to pull off.

07:52.055 --> 07:55.547
No. I don't mean like the cape and stuff.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.432
I'm talking like a doctor or a lawyer
or something.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.554
-Lawyer.
-Yeah.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.517
Working pro bono for the poor.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.399
Don't let my dad hear you say that.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.061
Why? What's your dad
got against poor people?

08:09.239 --> 08:10.900
Everything.

08:11.199 --> 08:16.410
-He thinks poverty is another word for lazy.
-What do you think?

08:20.208 --> 08:24.952
I think it would drive my dad nuts
if I got a job working with the poor.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.542
Got room for a partner?

08:29.259 --> 08:30.874
Allenmeyer and Luthor?

08:32.095 --> 08:33.426
Luthor and Allenmeyer.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.587
Deal.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.312
Now all we gotta do
is graduate in one piece.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.097
Come on.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.891
Hurry.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.395
-Did you get it?
-I got it.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.188
Let's go.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.743
Oh, man, this is too cool.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.278
-Sweet.
-Nobody saw us.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.621
Awesome.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.212
What are they doing?

09:10.383 --> 09:13.967
Stealing answers to the midterms.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.981
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble, Mrs. Kent.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.144
You can't live on coffee
three meals a day, Chloe.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.984
I mix it up with the occasional
blueberry mufﬁn.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.908
-What? That has a food group in it.
-Barely.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.995
-So you ﬁnd anything new?
-Tons.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.498
There've been reports of unusual
occurrences all over the world.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.331
It's like the Wall of Weird
went global.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.588
The worst attack was on a village
in the Kashmir region of India.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.669
The entire village
was nearly destroyed.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.342
They saw something fall
from the sky the night before.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.809
That's the same time I escaped
from the Phantom Zone.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.188
You think whatever it was
got out when you escaped?

10:09.359 --> 10:11.691
Like that park ranger.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.476
How about a trip to the ice castle?

10:13.655 --> 10:16.818
Maybe Jor-El could help track the Zoners
before they do more damage.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.189
Zoners?

10:19.619 --> 10:22.827
Escaped super criminals from the
Phantom Zone's a bit of a mouthful.

10:22.998 --> 10:27.867
The Fortress is dead. There's no way
to contact Jor-El and ask for his help.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.998
-I should have just listened to him.
-And done what, Clark?

10:31.172 --> 10:34.255
Killed Lex to stop Zod
from taking over his body?

10:34.426 --> 10:36.758
You're not a murderer, Clark.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.010
What about those people
in that village, Mom?

10:39.180 --> 10:42.547
They might have died because
of my actions. I need to know for sure.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.182
Then we need to ﬁnd
more crater impacts...

10:49.566 --> 10:52.057
...like the one you made
when you came out of the Zone.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.396
I think our best bet
would be satellite images.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.778
I thought satellites were down
on Dark Thursday?

10:56.948 --> 10:59.781
All except for a few
owned by Queen Industries.

10:59.951 --> 11:03.193
If we could get the access codes,
I might be able to ﬁnd an image...

11:03.371 --> 11:07.114
...of whatever it is that came down
before the attack on that village.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.908
Oliver Queen still owes me one.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.249
Maybe it's time to collect.

11:16.551 --> 11:21.090
Seeing somebody you laughed with,
shared so many good times together....

11:21.639 --> 11:24.255
Seeing them laid out on a table like that....

11:24.934 --> 11:26.595
At least they say he didn't suffer.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.307
Yeah. But I'm guessing
it didn't tickle either.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.938
You know, Alden called me a month ago.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.394
Said he wanted to go out
for a drink and l....

11:37.197 --> 11:40.485
I told him I was busy.
Said I'd catch up with him later.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.819
You couldn't have known
this was gonna happen.

11:44.329 --> 11:48.823
All the more reason to live for today.
Keep in touch with old friends?

11:51.836 --> 11:54.794
Why don't you all get together
while you're here?

11:56.674 --> 11:58.835
What about Duncan,
does he live in Metropolis?

12:05.183 --> 12:09.722
-Not anymore.
-I have to be getting back to Gotham.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.437
You got a great gal there, Ollie.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.269
Don't screw it up.

12:47.350 --> 12:50.217
Smart guy. You should listen to him.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.010
I'm all ears.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.681
Clark.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.893
l was wondering if my system
would keep you out.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.772
-Looks like you need an upgrade.
-Or you need to learn to knock.

13:38.985 --> 13:42.227
It's okay. You know what? You can keep
that arrow, I've got a new one.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.942
l was thinking about a boxing-glove arrow,
then I thought:

13:48.119 --> 13:49.575
"Something a little fancier."

14:07.514 --> 14:09.254
Contained electromagnetic pulse.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.048
Knocks out everything electrical
within an 8-foot radius.

14:12.227 --> 14:16.220
Cameras, laser systems, pacemakers.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.638
The last one was a joke, Clark.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.850
l'm laughing on the inside.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.312
Maybe we'll get lucky one day
and it'll bubble to the surface.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.573
-To what do I owe the pleasure?
-To talk about Queen Industries.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.529
Their satellite grid.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.193
What about it?

14:33.373 --> 14:37.161
My friend Chloe, she's doing a story
on the global effects of Dark Thursday.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.623
She needs satellite images from that day,
but none were working.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.786
Except mine.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.705
Now, hoW'd you manage that?

14:44.634 --> 14:45.919
It's a trade secret.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.709
Tell you what...

14:48.596 --> 14:51.133
...l'll give Chloe the access codes
to the archive...

14:51.307 --> 14:52.888
...if you do one thing for me.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.049
What would that be?

14:55.228 --> 14:59.562
Help me ﬁgure out how Lex caused
the accidental death of two of my friends.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.478
You think Lex killed them?

15:02.652 --> 15:05.564
I've known Lex
a lot longer than you, Clark.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.280
I've seen who he really is.

15:16.666 --> 15:20.124
-l'm just saying we should think about this.
-What's there to think about?

15:20.295 --> 15:23.958
We tell the headmaster what we saw
and Queen and those jerks are out of here.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.999
But we have something on Queen now.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.919
No way is he ever gonna
try anything again.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.885
We can use this.

15:35.059 --> 15:39.268
Force him to act like our friend
so we can have some respect in this place.

15:41.691 --> 15:45.604
You don't pretend
to be friends with somebody, Lex.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.518
You either are or you aren't.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.823
I'm gonna turn them in.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.904
I thought you said
you were gonna handle this.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.586
You told them?

16:09.385 --> 16:11.637
This is our chance, Duncan.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.171
We don't have to be
on the outside anymore.

16:18.061 --> 16:21.394
I never felt that way,
not when you were my friend.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.222
-Just listen to me.
-Get out of my way.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.398
Hey, where do you think you're going?

16:29.572 --> 16:32.063
Just keep your mouth shut
and everything will be okay.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.573
Get off of me.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.411
Get him, right on.
Get him, cue ball.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.577
Why do you have to be such a loser?

16:46.047 --> 16:48.129
Why can't you be like everybody else?

16:50.635 --> 16:52.421
Are you okay?

16:53.221 --> 16:54.677
Yeah.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.428
Bad dream.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.347
What was it about?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.634
I don't remember.

17:01.604 --> 17:05.893
Lex, it's normal to be upset.
Alden died right in front of you.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.308
Yeah, well, maybe he ﬁnally
got what he deserved.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.649
How can you say that about your friend?

17:13.741 --> 17:16.323
| only had one friend at Excelsior.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.735
And it sure as hell wasn't him.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.949
Do you wanna talk about it?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.208
Not really.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.712
Lana, I'm all right.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.089
I'm the last thing
you have to worry about.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.100
The last thing, huh?

17:48.818 --> 17:51.059
Well, at least it didn't break.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.407
Did you see that?

18:03.166 --> 18:05.953
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about, Lana.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.674
See?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.509
Lex.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.889
Lana!

18:33.696 --> 18:35.687
Lana?

18:39.577 --> 18:41.488
Lana.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.538
She sustained a serious concussion,
but the CAT scans are negative.

18:53.716 --> 18:57.755
-Couple of days of rest and she'll be ﬁne.
-l'|l make sure she gets it.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.304
-Where's Lana?
-She'll be ﬁne.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.137
-That's the only thing that matters.
-I wanna talk to her.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.348
You lost your visiting rights
a while back, Clark.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.934
lwouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you, Lex.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.819
Since you've been with her
she has a habit of getting hurt.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.903
And how many times did she wind up
in the hospital when she was dating you?

19:32.296 --> 19:34.753
Save yourself the trip next time, Clark.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.131
Just send ﬂowers.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.087
That was harsh.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.269
It's not like he's wrong, though.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.555
I've hurt Lana more than anyone. She
wouldn't be with Lex if it wasn't for me.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.814
Lana made that questionable choice
on her own.

19:53.985 --> 19:57.148
Stop beating yourself up.
That's my job.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.400
And my other one
is snifﬁng out a good story.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.318
That's why you're here?

20:02.493 --> 20:06.111
I don't think Lana's chandelier run-in
was an accident...

20:06.289 --> 20:08.120
...or that she was the target.

20:08.291 --> 20:11.033
In the past 24 hours,
two of Lex and Oliver's old friends...

20:11.210 --> 20:14.293
...from boarding school
died in violent accidents.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.004
And you think Lex was almost the third?

20:17.174 --> 20:20.166
It has something to do
with a kid named Duncan they all knew...

20:20.344 --> 20:22.084
...but Oliver won't tell me anything.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.259
I don't want you to end up
sharing a hospital room with Lana.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.846
Get some distance
between you and Oliver for now.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.854
Or I could man up and get
to the bottom of this like a real reporter.

20:33.024 --> 20:37.518
Preferably before the Grim Reaper drops
something very heavy on my hot boyfriend.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.867
ls Lana gonna be okay?

20:51.542 --> 20:52.827
I think so.

20:53.002 --> 20:56.335
Looks like you were wrong about Lex
being the one behind the attacks.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.793
Unless he orchestrated this one
to throw off suspicion.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.835
If Lex was the only one hurt,
then I'd probably think the same thing.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.839
But he loves Lana too much
to risk her life.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.844
Look, these attacks aren't random.

21:19.528 --> 21:23.362
Lois seems to think it may have something
to do with the kid back at Excelsior.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.147
Duncan?

21:27.161 --> 21:30.403
-lt's not Duncan.
-How can you be sure?

21:36.170 --> 21:38.707
Because Lex and I killed him
10 years ago.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.955
Why do you have to be such a loser?

21:41.133 --> 21:42.464
-Lex, stop it.
-That's enough.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.296
Lex, stop it. What are you doing?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.085
Come on, stop.

21:52.186 --> 21:55.098
-Dude.
-Psycho much?

21:57.149 --> 22:00.107
There's something seriously
wrong with you.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.824
-Duncan.
-Get away from me.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.547
You wanna be
one of them so badly, Lex?

22:25.511 --> 22:30.096
Is that it? You can't stand
being a loser like me?

22:30.433 --> 22:33.345
Well, congratulations, buddy.
Now you're their friend.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.759
And you can now all--

22:35.688 --> 22:37.553
Duncan!

22:37.815 --> 22:39.601
Oh, my God.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.109
Duncan suffered massive brain injuries.

22:48.284 --> 22:51.776
Is there anything else
that you haven't told me?

22:54.248 --> 22:56.204
Just the dénouement.

22:56.792 --> 23:01.081
Lionel Luthor sweeping in with the best
doctors in the world to save Duncan.

23:01.881 --> 23:02.870
Lionel.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.666
I thought it was an act of kindness.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.045
Now that I'm older,
I realize it was just an act.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.722
Lionel was trying to cover up
what happened between Lex and Duncan.

23:14.268 --> 23:17.305
Trying to cover up the stink
off the Luthor name.

23:17.688 --> 23:20.065
How did he know about all this?

23:21.525 --> 23:24.141
He got the whole story from Lex.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.942
Duncan was on scholarship.

23:29.116 --> 23:32.904
His parents couldn't afford a Band-Aid,
let alone a team of neurosurgeons.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.536
So Lionel promised to take care
of the whole thing.

23:36.499 --> 23:39.081
-As long as everyone kept quiet.
-Not that it mattered.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.743
Duncan died two days later.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.543
It was an accident.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.253
It just happened.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.130
No.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.263
No, I told myself that same lie for years.

23:55.810 --> 23:59.143
Truth is, all of us might as well
have pushed him in front of that car.

23:59.313 --> 24:02.680
Alden, Geoffrey, Lex, me.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.311
We all killed Duncan Allenmeyer.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.250
What about his family?

24:20.417 --> 24:22.829
If you killed him,
one of them might be behind this.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.745
But the only relative
I could ﬁnd was his mother.

24:26.257 --> 24:29.044
-Where's she?
-Granville Cemetery.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.049
She passed away a month ago.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.379
Well, there must be someone else
you may have missed.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.094
I don't know.

24:38.602 --> 24:42.220
The only one who had contact
with Duncan's family was Lionel.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.229
I'm not exactly high
on his buddy list.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.516
Not a good chance of him talking to me.

25:02.751 --> 25:08.212
I was just on my way down the street
to Pastis for lunch.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.794
-You hungry?
-No, this isn't a social visit.

25:10.968 --> 25:11.957
Oh, that's a pity.

25:12.136 --> 25:17.130
The owner's wife does
a soufﬁé au fromage that is....

25:17.308 --> 25:19.640
Well, it is out of this world.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.801
Duncan Allenmeyer.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.640
How do you know that name?

25:27.818 --> 25:29.479
Oliver Queen ﬁlled me in.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.520
Oh, yes, the Queen boy.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.064
He should know better
than to dig up old skeletons.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.109
I'm not sure he's the only one
with a shovel in his hand.

25:39.288 --> 25:43.201
These attacks, I think someone who was
close to Duncan is trying to settle the score.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.491
Lex was the only one close to him.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.081
No other family members
besides his mother?

25:48.714 --> 25:51.080
-He didn't have any.
-There's gotta be someone.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.173
What is it you're not telling me?

25:57.056 --> 25:59.843
-Clark—
-Two people are already dead.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.383
Do you wanna add Lex
to the body count?

26:04.396 --> 26:06.227
Now, please, tell me.

26:12.488 --> 26:16.106
It was a tragedy,
what happened to Duncan.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.945
I did everything possible to help him.

26:22.164 --> 26:26.032
I have continued to do that
for the past 10 years.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.044
Duncan's alive?

26:28.671 --> 26:31.959
My medical team was able
to keep his heart beating.

26:33.133 --> 26:38.218
But the injuries from his accident have
left him in a permanent vegetative state.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.472
Why did you let everyone believe
he was still dead?

26:46.522 --> 26:48.058
Clark...

26:51.819 --> 26:55.732
...I didn't want Lex to be crippled
by his mistakes.

26:55.906 --> 26:59.364
I decided to make an arrangement
with Duncan's mother...

26:59.535 --> 27:03.119
...in exchange for her silence,
going along with the story...

27:03.956 --> 27:08.666
...I agreed to fund a research program...

27:09.586 --> 27:13.249
...dedicated to reversing the damage
to her son's brain.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.718
This is still going on.

27:18.012 --> 27:22.972
The best research minds in the world have
tried hundreds of different treatments, but—

27:23.142 --> 27:25.098
What if one of them worked?

28:05.059 --> 28:07.766
It's time for your treatment, Duncan.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.165
Smallville?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.118
Lois, what are you doing here?

28:34.296 --> 28:36.662
I'm following a lead.
I checked out Duncan's mother.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.377
-She's dead.
-I know that, Sherlock.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.758
On a hunch, I dug up
all her old phone records.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.921
Every day, while she was still kicking,
she called this facility.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.090
She was checking on her son.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.644
Duncan? I thought he was dead.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.928
Yeah, so did everyone else.

28:52.106 --> 28:56.315
-I think he's in this room.
-How do you know all this?

28:57.152 --> 29:00.440
-You're not the only one with hunches.
-Nice work.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.147
Lois?

29:09.206 --> 29:11.162
It's my story. I don't share bylines.

29:13.627 --> 29:17.791
It's locked. You stay here.
I'm gonna ﬂirt us up a set of keys, all right?

29:21.802 --> 29:23.667
Lois.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.552
It was just stuck.

29:27.057 --> 29:30.049
Fine. Ladies ﬁrst.

29:39.695 --> 29:40.775
Yes?

29:40.946 --> 29:43.062
He’s arriving now, Mr. Queen.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.650
Thank you.

29:50.998 --> 29:54.115
Lex, l was wondering how long
it was gonna take you to pop up.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.919
I've been busy at the hospital.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.499
I heard about Lana.

30:00.674 --> 30:03.632
-ls she gonna be all right?
-She'll be ﬁne.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.417
Not that you really care.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.587
No, I do care.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.591
I care that a nice girl like that
ended up with a guy like you.

30:14.188 --> 30:17.476
Ever since you came to Metropolis,
I've been kidnapped...

30:17.649 --> 30:18.980
...my life put in jeopardy...

30:19.151 --> 30:21.733
...and now the woman I love
is lying in a hospital bed.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.197
And you think that's my fault.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.022
Sounds to me more like bad karma.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.444
Go back to Star City, Oliver...

30:31.872 --> 30:33.658
...while you still can.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.408
I've seen that look before.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.535
When was it?

30:42.090 --> 30:43.705
Oh, yeah.

30:44.635 --> 30:48.503
When you almost beat your only friend
to death back at Excelsior.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.679
That's good.

31:01.151 --> 31:04.314
The ﬁrst one's free.
The next one's gonna cost you.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.275
Poor little Lex.

31:11.453 --> 31:14.069
Always blaming everyone else
for all of his problems.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.455
Only when they're the cause.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.210
You never could take responsibility
for what happened.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.045
Like your hands were clean?

31:28.470 --> 31:29.801
Not even close.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.429
But since then,
I've been scrubbing them real hard.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.100
Yours just keep getting dirtier.

31:49.533 --> 31:50.522
Lex.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.847
I'm not a doctor, but I've seen
enough to know...

32:19.021 --> 32:22.058
...you don't get squiggly lines
when you're in a vegetative state.

32:22.232 --> 32:25.065
Unless your new treatments are working.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.025
What new treatment?

32:27.195 --> 32:30.687
Something called 12B. It's experimental.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.948
It's derived from reﬁned meteor rocks.

32:33.368 --> 32:37.031
Clark, they started giving him this stuff
two days ago.

32:37.205 --> 32:40.197
-Look at the injection times.
-They coincide with the attacks.

32:41.251 --> 32:42.957
Maybe we just found our killer.

32:43.545 --> 32:47.254
Wait, these treatments might stimulate
brain activity, but he's in a wheelchair.

32:47.424 --> 32:50.166
His body is, yeah. But look at his charts.

32:50.344 --> 32:53.677
His new cocktail is whipping up
a hell of an electrical storm.

32:53.847 --> 32:57.806
I read this article in The Inquisitor
about brain waves and astral projection.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.307
Astral projection?

33:00.354 --> 33:01.890
Do you have a better explanation?

33:03.065 --> 33:06.478
No. When was his last injection?

33:07.402 --> 33:08.482
Twenty minutes ago.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.531
Oh, my God. It's happening again.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.407
Smallville, l--

34:13.885 --> 34:15.295
Hey.

34:15.470 --> 34:16.505
What happened?

34:16.930 --> 34:19.342
You went AWOL while things heated up,
as usual.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.016
I went to go ﬁnd a phone
to warn Oliver and Lex.

34:23.979 --> 34:26.186
Did you get ahold of them?
Are they all right?

34:26.356 --> 34:29.689
A little worse for wear. Oliver said
whatever happened suddenly stopped.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.484
Well, Duncan went ﬂatline,
like he blew a fuse.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.521
I wonder what caused it.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.440
You need that for your article?

34:38.618 --> 34:41.746
Well, it would be good,
if I were still going to write one.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.028
But you're not?

34:43.540 --> 34:46.748
It would make a juicy story
for The Inquisitor.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.376
But considering the outcome,
an exploitation piece...

34:50.547 --> 34:53.914
...on a catatonic patient
astral-projecting his way to revenge...

34:54.092 --> 34:56.208
...might be in bad taste.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.586
Would you feel the same way
if Oliver wasn't involved?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.672
We've all done things
we're not proud of.

35:02.851 --> 35:05.092
I just wish Oliver didn't feel
he had to hide it.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.103
You know...

35:10.358 --> 35:13.771
...sometimes, in order to protect
the people we love...

35:14.196 --> 35:16.528
...we keep secrets.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.106
That is...

35:20.368 --> 35:22.575
...totally retarded.

35:36.635 --> 35:40.002
I wasn't the most popular kid
at Excelsior.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.837
The way I looked....

35:42.390 --> 35:45.803
The rumors about what happened
to my brother, Julian....

35:46.728 --> 35:48.764
But Duncan didn't care.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.896
He was my only friend.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.100
And I betrayed him.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.729
Lex, you were just a boy.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.569
What matters is the man you've become.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.920
You're early.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.712
It's not often I get invited
into the lion's den.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.592
I didn't want you changing your mind.

36:22.430 --> 36:25.422
I'm sure you two have a lot to discuss.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.386
Mr. Queen.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.642
Miss Lang.

36:31.273 --> 36:32.763
You're a lucky man.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.357
In more ways than one.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.689
I should be dead...

36:42.742 --> 36:43.993
...but here I stand.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.410
Well, you would have done
the same thing for me...

36:47.622 --> 36:48.611
...right?

36:48.790 --> 36:51.031
I wanted to say thank you.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.375
And that's all I wanted to say.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.417
I'm sure you have business
to get back to.

36:58.341 --> 36:59.501
Lex.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.803
What happened to Duncan...

37:11.354 --> 37:13.766
...the way I treated both of you...

37:16.318 --> 37:18.024
...it's not something I'm proud of.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.522
I want you to know how much I regret it.

37:30.916 --> 37:36.161
And I regret ever thinking
I needed friends like you.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.938
Why'd you lie to me?

38:01.696 --> 38:04.984
All those years, you let me think
he was dead.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.113
What would you have done
if you had known the truth?

38:09.287 --> 38:12.029
Make daily pilgrimages
to the poor boy's bedside?

38:12.707 --> 38:15.540
Yes, I let you think he was dead.

38:15.710 --> 38:19.077
I was giving you a chance
to move on with your life.

38:19.255 --> 38:23.123
-To go fonNard, not back.
-You didn't do this for me.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.378
You convinced Duncan's mother
so you could use him as a guinea pig.

38:27.555 --> 38:31.548
And one of your treatments tapped into
a very powerful part of the human brain.

38:32.227 --> 38:35.890
All right. Let's assume that's true.
Would that have made a difference?

38:36.064 --> 38:38.931
You were responsible for what happened
to Duncan Allenmeyer.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.647
Nothing is ever gonna change that.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.191
Like you said, Dad.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.904
The only thing I can do is look fonNard.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.620
I wanna see the data
on Duncan's last treatment.

38:57.919 --> 39:00.786
Have it on my desk
ﬁrst thing in the morning.

39:10.390 --> 39:14.178
So that thing that attacked us, Duncan's
astral body, or whatever you call it...

39:14.352 --> 39:16.559
...must have been
electrical manifestation.

39:16.730 --> 39:19.062
Yeah, he got tried
by your electromagnetic arrow...

39:19.232 --> 39:21.974
...along with what was left
of Duncan's brain.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.154
Yeah, I guess you're right.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.608
You know, making the wrong choices
and living with the consequences...

39:31.786 --> 39:32.901
...it's not easy, is it?

39:34.289 --> 39:35.995
Speaking from experience, huh?

39:36.916 --> 39:38.622
More than I'd like.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.506
We all make bad choices, Clark.

39:46.676 --> 39:49.383
All we can do is hope
to make the right ones in the future.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.423
Clark.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.596
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had company.

39:58.438 --> 39:59.974
Chloe, Oliver Queen.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.982
Hi. I feel like I know you already.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.813
Lois talks about you all the time.

40:06.196 --> 40:08.983
I was actually just gonna go
see Lois right now.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.819
Maybe it's time I did some talking.

40:12.368 --> 40:15.155
Well, I'm looking forward
to your article on Dark Thursday.

40:19.209 --> 40:22.372
-I hope my satellite images helped.
-Yeah.

40:22.796 --> 40:23.831
Good.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.506
It was good to meet you.

40:26.216 --> 40:27.547
Clark.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.011
In person, he is really....

40:38.812 --> 40:42.179
Chloe. Were you able
to pull anything off the satellites?

40:42.732 --> 40:45.849
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm still sifting
through the images...

40:46.027 --> 40:49.645
...but I already found a handful of craters
that matched the one you made...

40:49.823 --> 40:51.438
...when you busted
out of the Zone.

40:52.575 --> 40:55.157
Which means more Zoners on Earth.

40:56.496 --> 40:57.702
You ﬁnd the one in India?

40:58.248 --> 41:02.082
That was just a smoking hole.
But I did ﬁnd another one in Australia...

41:02.252 --> 41:03.913
...that you might wanna look at.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.463
Is there someone in the crater?

41:11.803 --> 41:15.546
I blew it up as much as I could.
It's not very clear, but--

41:24.524 --> 41:25.730
What is it?

41:30.530 --> 41:31.565
Raya.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.935
