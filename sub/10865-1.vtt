00:30.640 --> 00:32.080
Tonight's one of
those meetings

00:32.080 --> 00:34.560
I always have
mixed feelings about.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.000
It's sad because
Frank's family moved

00:37.000 --> 00:38.680
and we've lost
one of our members,

00:38.680 --> 00:41.880
but it's exciting because
we have to find a new member.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.280
Who did you bring?

00:43.280 --> 00:45.480
Nobody!
I brought him.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.040
Tucker's gonna
nominate somebody?

00:48.040 --> 00:51.080
Why not? He's a
friend of mine.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.360
You say that
like it's a good thing.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.080
So, who's the new meat?

00:56.080 --> 00:57.640
Hi, babe.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.960
Oh! No. No, no.
Anyone but Stig.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.200
You know this guy?

01:01.200 --> 01:02.720
Yeah. He's a virus.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.959
Don't let him next to the
fire. He might explode.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.920
Tuck, I don't know
about this.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.520
Aw, come on.
Give him a chance.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.920
Yeah. Is this about
telling a good story

01:11.920 --> 01:14.000
or winning
a popularity contest?

01:17.840 --> 01:20.120
Excellent. Sit
over there, Stig.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.000
Hey! That's my sweater.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
What? The log was wet.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.200
Don't push it,
grungy boy.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.000
All right.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.520
I figure I've gotta
impress you guys,

01:42.520 --> 01:44.520
so I'm taking my best shot.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.760
A lot of people
don't like the way I am.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.520
They're always telling me
I've gotta clean up my act.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.520
But sometimes, things are the
way they are for a reason.

01:57.520 --> 02:01.440
If you go making changes
that shouldn't be made,

02:01.440 --> 02:05.840
you're gonna end up
with a whole mess of trouble.

02:07.880 --> 02:11.960
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:11.960 --> 02:13.840
I call this story...

02:29.520 --> 02:33.080
Charlie, you sure
it's OK?

02:33.080 --> 02:36.480
['50s rock 'n roll

02:36.480 --> 02:39.080
Yes. Just be careful.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.720
Yah ha ha!

02:46.040 --> 02:47.800
You're the lifeguard.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.680
Shouldn't you be guarding
my brother's life?

02:52.720 --> 02:54.960
You want me to leave?

02:54.960 --> 02:56.720
Not really.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.960
Ugh.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.360
P-U. What is that smell?

03:25.480 --> 03:26.600
What the--

03:32.480 --> 03:34.960
Charlie!

03:37.040 --> 03:40.080
Charlie, there's
something in the pool!

03:41.440 --> 03:43.320
[Screams]

03:55.000 --> 03:56.520
[Poof]

03:56.520 --> 03:58.480
Aah!
Aah!

04:00.920 --> 04:01.920
Oops.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.840
I'm sorry.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.840
I didn't expect the
reaction to be so intense.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.920
Apparently your calculations
were a little flawed.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.800
Don't move.
I'll get the custodian.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.560
<i> Zeke Matthews
was one of those dips</i>

04:21.560 --> 04:23.680
<i> who lived for schoolwork.</i>

04:23.680 --> 04:27.320
<i> I guess you might call him
the smartest loser in school.</i>

04:27.320 --> 04:29.560
What a geek.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.360
I think he's cute...

04:31.360 --> 04:33.880
Like a puppy you want
to take care of.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.920
More like a puppy you
have to clean up after.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.040
Come on. Let's help him.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.120
Forget it.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.960
Hey. What went wrong?

04:46.960 --> 04:48.760
Nothing.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.280
If you mix maganite
with water,

04:54.280 --> 04:56.200
the reaction
is always the same.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.640
Kaboom.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.160
Lava surprise.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.960
I just miscalculated
the ratio.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.800
How interesting.
My education is complete.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.240
[Bell rings]

05:08.000 --> 05:10.360
We'll continue
next time, people.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.360
Charlie can do this,
Zeke.

05:25.880 --> 05:30.880
<i> Actually, school work wasn't
the only thing on Zeke's mind.</i>

05:36.280 --> 05:38.000
Hi. Clorice?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.160
You're on the
swim team, right?

05:40.160 --> 05:41.840
Yes. So?

05:41.840 --> 05:43.840
I'd like to show
you something

05:43.840 --> 05:45.840
I think you might
find interesting...

05:45.840 --> 05:47.840
Because you're on
the team, I mean.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.320
What is it?

05:49.320 --> 05:51.840
I'd rather show you.
How about after school?

05:51.840 --> 05:54.320
I have practice. I'm on
the swim team, remember?

05:54.320 --> 05:55.400
Right.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.840
What about tomorrow,
before school?

05:57.840 --> 05:59.320
Just tell me
what it is.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.840
That's no fun.

06:00.840 --> 06:05.760
<i> Fun? You're telling me
what's fun?</i>

06:05.760 --> 06:08.280
OK, beaker boy.
You're on.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.600
Great. Meet me tomorrow
at the gym at about 7:30?

06:30.840 --> 06:33.760
I forgot. This is
the boys change room--

06:33.760 --> 06:35.840
Hello?
Is anybody here?

06:38.320 --> 06:39.760
If this is
your big surprise,

06:39.760 --> 06:41.280
I've seen it already.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.520
Watch this.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.840
What are you doing?

06:49.840 --> 06:51.960
Last week I was
trying to calculate

06:51.960 --> 06:53.760
the volume
of the school.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.760
I found out there's
more to this building

06:55.760 --> 06:57.360
than meets the eye.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.120
Oh, man.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.440
I didn't know
this was here.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.200
Strange, isn't it?

07:32.200 --> 07:35.120
After I found it,
I did some research.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.240
It was built
in the 1950s,

07:37.240 --> 07:39.240
but they only used
it for a short time.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.240
How come?

07:40.240 --> 07:41.440
I don't know.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.280
Unbelievable.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.240
Hey! Maybe I can get
the school to open it up again.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.240
I doubt it.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.720
Why? We shouldn't
have to drive

07:50.720 --> 07:52.720
an hour to practice if
there's a pool right here.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
True, but they'll
never--

07:53.720 --> 07:55.520
Uh, stop.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.560
Excuses are for people who never
get things done, understand?

07:59.560 --> 08:03.040
Good. Thanks. You did
a real cool thing here.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.680
I did?

08:04.680 --> 08:06.880
Hey, maybe we can
get together sometime--

08:06.880 --> 08:08.240
Don't push it.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.520
[Whistle blows]

08:40.240 --> 08:41.679
<i> Clorice wasn't kidding.</i>

08:41.679 --> 08:44.080
<i> She got in the face
of everybody at school</i>

08:44.080 --> 08:46.800
<i> and wouldn't take no
for an answer.</i>

08:46.800 --> 08:49.360
<i> After a few weeks,
the swim team had their pool.</i>

08:56.240 --> 08:58.520
Not bad, huh?

09:12.600 --> 09:16.200
I don't know how
you did it, but...

09:18.200 --> 09:19.120
Oh, man.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.800
What's that smell?

09:28.080 --> 09:30.160
The pipes must
still be dirty.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.200
It's gross.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.280
C minus?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.200
I hate science.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.640
It could be worse.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.680
No kidding.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.520
If I don't bring
this grade up,

09:55.520 --> 09:57.680
I'm off the swim team.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.640
Maybe I could help you.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.680
How?

10:03.720 --> 10:05.640
Maybe I could
tutor you.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.000
Chemistry is
kind of my subject.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.640
What's in it for you?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.160
How'd you get in?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.280
Stole the key
from my coach.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.160
I wonder
if we get caught.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.160
I'm not doing
anything wrong,

10:38.160 --> 10:40.360
and we're the only
ones here.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.200
You ever teach anyone
to swim before?

10:46.200 --> 10:48.680
Yes. Enough questions.
Dive in.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.160
Hey, you really are
afraid of the water.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.720
OK. We'll take it slow.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.560
See? It's not so bad.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.800
What is it that scares you
so much?

11:16.640 --> 11:18.600
It's dumb. Really.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.840
Tell me.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.080
When I was a kid,

11:26.080 --> 11:28.600
I was swimming
in a pond.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.200
I got my foot tangled
in some underwater plants

11:32.200 --> 11:35.440
and couldn't get loose.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.440
The harder I tried,
the worse it got.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.600
Almost drowned.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.400
Then what happened?

11:43.400 --> 11:45.600
My brother saw me,
cut me loose.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.080
But ever since,
I've had this feeling

11:48.080 --> 11:50.880
that there's
something down there...

11:50.880 --> 11:53.600
Waiting, because
I cheated it once.

11:53.600 --> 11:57.320
It wants a second
chance with me.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.840
Zeke, I guarantee you,

12:09.840 --> 12:14.920
in the pool there's nothing
down there to get you.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.040
Try putting your hand
in the water.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.760
See? That wasn't so bad.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.040
Now try--

12:31.040 --> 12:33.160
Clorice! Clorice!

12:33.160 --> 12:34.040
[Coughing]

12:34.040 --> 12:35.080
What happened?

12:35.080 --> 12:36.760
Boo!

12:46.800 --> 12:48.240
Not funny, Greta!

12:48.240 --> 12:50.320
I thought you didn't
like puppies.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.240
He's helping me
with chemistry.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.600
Yeah. Right.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.000
What was that
about puppies?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.200
Nothing. Are you OK?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.160
Yeah. I think.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.000
Maybe we should go.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.600
No. I want to help you.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.520
Now, relax.
There's nothing down there.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.480
Yeah, I know. Just...

13:22.480 --> 13:24.360
Take a look.
Nothing's there.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.080
See anything?

13:33.080 --> 13:33.800
No.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.040
OK. Put your hand
in again.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.280
You smell that?

13:48.280 --> 13:50.000
[Sniffs]

13:50.000 --> 13:51.760
Yeah. What is it?

13:51.760 --> 13:55.040
I don't know.
Smells like acid.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.520
Zeke!

13:57.520 --> 13:58.560
Zeke!

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
Zeke!

14:06.360 --> 14:09.000
Hold my hand.

14:11.880 --> 14:12.560
What happened?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.320
[Coughing]

14:14.320 --> 14:18.240
Something grabbed me.
It tried to drown me.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.880
What?

14:19.880 --> 14:21.440
There's nobody down there.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.440
I'm telling you,
it grabbed me.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.840
Do you think maybe it was
just because of your fear?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.760
You mean,
like I imagined it?

14:32.760 --> 14:34.360
There's nothing
in the pool, Zeke.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.240
Yeah. I guess
you're right.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.000
It's not logical that--

14:41.000 --> 14:42.680
What was that?

14:42.680 --> 14:44.800
What's happening?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.000
It's gonna dump us!

14:46.000 --> 14:47.800
Let's get outta here.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.720
[Screams]

14:55.320 --> 14:58.000
<i>There is something
in the pool.</i>

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
We can't paddle.
It'll grab us.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.240
It's OK.
We'll stay right here.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.560
Someone will find us.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.520
Wait. That smell.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.320
That acid smell.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.840
[Screaming]

15:19.080 --> 15:21.240
Hang on! I got you.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.880
Grab this!

15:34.280 --> 15:37.680
Charlie, what was that?

15:42.760 --> 15:44.280
It's back.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.320
Or maybe it never left.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.080
What's back?

15:50.080 --> 15:55.880
I was the lifeguard
when this pool first opened.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.200
My girlfriend's
little brother drowned

15:59.200 --> 16:02.120
on my watch, but...

16:02.120 --> 16:05.200
It was no accident.

16:05.200 --> 16:09.800
I tried to save him,
but it wouldn't let me.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.720
It pulled him away from me,

16:11.720 --> 16:15.280
and then...
Then he was gone.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.160
Nobody believed me,

16:27.160 --> 16:30.120
until 3 more
people drowned.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.200
Hey--closed down the pool,

16:36.200 --> 16:39.400
people forgot
all about it...

16:41.200 --> 16:42.360
Until now.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.800
What is it?
What's in there?

16:44.800 --> 16:48.360
When they built
the pool,

16:48.360 --> 16:51.360
they had to get rid
of an old cemetery

16:51.360 --> 16:53.000
and move the bodies.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.400
Nearest I can figure
is they missed one,

16:57.400 --> 17:01.920
and its spirit wants
revenge for being disturbed.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.040
The same thing's
gonna happen.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.160
No one's gonna believe us
until someone gets hurt.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.599
Maybe not.

17:08.599 --> 17:12.440
Maybe there's a way to even
things out a little bit.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.560
Nobody believes in this
thing because it's invisible,

17:17.560 --> 17:19.160
but maybe we can get
a look at it.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.079
How?

17:20.079 --> 17:21.119
It smells, remember?

17:21.119 --> 17:22.680
Like rotten eggs.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.359
Like acid.

17:24.359 --> 17:27.280
Here. Methyl orange.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.680
We're gonna do
a little experiment.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.000
Methyl orange
reacts with acid.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.120
If this thing
is really part acid,

17:48.120 --> 17:50.760
we should get
a nice, red snapshot.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.960
How can you be
sure to--

17:58.960 --> 18:02.400
Wait. You smell that?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.440
That's it.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.760
It's coming.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.680
Look.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.160
What is it?

18:09.160 --> 18:10.520
I can't tell.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.160
Wait. It's taking shape.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.120
It looks like...

18:21.120 --> 18:22.200
It's...

18:24.080 --> 18:25.880
[Screams]

18:49.680 --> 18:53.000
Water.
It's made of water!

18:53.000 --> 18:54.160
He's in shock.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.320
Charlie, are you OK?

18:56.320 --> 18:58.640
Come on, Charlie.
Focus.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.840
We've gotta get out of here!

19:02.280 --> 19:03.520
He needs a doctor!

19:05.480 --> 19:06.920
What about that thing?

19:06.920 --> 19:09.640
Why'd it come out now,
after all this time?

19:09.640 --> 19:11.520
Because it can't
hide anymore.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.280
Come on, Charlie.
Focus!

19:13.280 --> 19:14.680
Let's just get a--

19:17.200 --> 19:19.080
Oh, no.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.120
[Screams]

19:21.840 --> 19:23.760
We can't leave Charlie
with that thing!

19:23.760 --> 19:26.560
I don't know
how to stop it.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.120
Maybe I do.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.760
It's made of water, right?

19:32.760 --> 19:34.280
What's your recipe,

19:34.280 --> 19:36.080
mix water with maganite,
and kaboom,

19:36.080 --> 19:37.080
lava surprise?

19:37.080 --> 19:39.560
My volcano.
That's brilliant!

19:43.440 --> 19:44.680
Why'd you do that?

19:44.680 --> 19:46.560
There's moisture
on your hands.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.120
It'll burn you.
You need gloves.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.640
I'm going after it.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.760
Clorice!

20:11.280 --> 20:12.480
Got it!

20:12.480 --> 20:14.920
Clorice! It's coming!
Swim!

20:16.720 --> 20:17.760
Get outta there!

20:17.760 --> 20:19.000
Clorice!

20:20.760 --> 20:22.560
Hurry up!

20:24.720 --> 20:26.520
Get outta there! Swim!

20:58.000 --> 21:00.320
I gotcha, kid!

21:00.320 --> 21:02.080
Yo, red! Catch!

21:29.520 --> 21:31.040
You did it.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.960
You really did it!

21:39.040 --> 21:43.040
Finally.
After all these years.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.320
It's over.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.880
Thank you, kids.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.880
Thank you.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.960
<i> The evil spirit never bothered
anyone again,</i>

21:58.960 --> 22:03.040
<i> and Charlie was no longer
tortured by his memories.</i>

22:08.040 --> 22:09.680
<i> As for Zeke and clorice,</i>

22:09.680 --> 22:12.320
<i> Clorice figured it was OK.
To be a science geek,</i>

22:12.320 --> 22:15.000
<i> and she showed Zeke there were
a lot more fun things to do</i>

22:15.000 --> 22:18.400
<i> than study all the time.</i>

22:18.400 --> 22:19.920
You wanna go for a swim?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.000
Sure.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.520
<i> Though Zeke still didn't
care much for water.</i>

22:36.000 --> 22:38.200
The end.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.680
Tell me
that wasn't the best.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.000
OK.
We've gotta vote.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.320
Hey!

23:01.320 --> 23:04.080
Eww. Ugh.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.400
Listen, um,

23:09.400 --> 23:11.480
you told
a great story,

23:11.480 --> 23:14.720
but the vote has to
be unanimous, and...

23:14.720 --> 23:15.800
It wasn't.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.120
But it's not fair.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.720
Yeah, well...

23:19.720 --> 23:22.000
Thanks for the shot.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.120
Wait! We're giving you
another chance.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.360
Come to a couple of meetings
and tell another story.

23:26.360 --> 23:27.880
If by then--

23:27.880 --> 23:30.360
If we don't think
you're a total puke...

23:30.360 --> 23:31.760
Then you're in.
Fair enough?

23:31.760 --> 23:33.960
I can handle that.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.360
Then handle a shower.
