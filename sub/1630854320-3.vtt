WEBVTT

00:19.839 --> 00:22.238
(Discordant music)

00:25.996 --> 00:27.995
(Gunshot)

00:39.349 --> 00:42.048
- (Elliot) Alex, cover your mouth!
- (Gas hissing)

00:42.148 --> 00:43.967
- Let's go.
- Move, move, move, move!

00:44.067 --> 00:46.425
Armed police!

00:49.424 --> 00:52.022
Armed police! Get down!

01:00.298 --> 01:02.297
Sean Wallace is dead.

01:04.536 --> 01:06.515
I repeat, Sean Wallace...

01:06.615 --> 01:08.614
(Gunshot)

01:10.653 --> 01:12.312
Here, help me.

01:12.412 --> 01:14.071
(Woman)
Clear.

01:14.171 --> 01:16.170
(Distant screaming)

01:21.047 --> 01:23.166
(Fast-paced dramatic music)

01:27.724 --> 01:30.002
(Lale)
Get him in the van!

01:33.281 --> 01:35.280
(Woman)
Clear.

01:36.119 --> 01:38.118
Is he dead?

01:40.197 --> 01:42.236
He's breathing. Drive.

01:45.634 --> 01:47.633
Hurry.

01:49.352 --> 01:51.011
Take the left.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.110
(Loud crash)

02:05.983 --> 02:08.242
(Man)
Defibrillator.

02:08.342 --> 02:11.860
(Woman)
Charging. Clear. Shock.

02:12.740 --> 02:16.098
(Man) Okay, we have him.
He's in a bad way...

02:20.736 --> 02:23.654
(Woman)
Sutures in place. Entering now.

02:24.933 --> 02:28.292
(Deep, slow breathing)

03:06.672 --> 03:08.671
(Door flap opens)

03:21.824 --> 03:23.823
(Groans)

03:25.342 --> 03:27.341
(Grunts)

03:47.770 --> 03:49.769
(Yells)

03:50.449 --> 03:52.447
(Tray clatters)

03:55.686 --> 03:58.045
(Shouting)

04:13.317 --> 04:15.315
Where am I?

04:18.074 --> 04:21.692
We would like your cooperation

04:21.792 --> 04:25.830
concerning a group
you call the Investors.

04:28.109 --> 04:30.428
You would be rewarded.

04:33.346 --> 04:35.345
You work for them?

04:38.823 --> 04:40.822
The opposite.

04:46.699 --> 04:48.698
(Sean)
You're not the police.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.456
A version of it.

04:53.615 --> 04:57.413
Well, then... fuck off.

05:13.085 --> 05:15.084
(Coughs)

05:16.124 --> 05:17.903
(Sobs)

05:18.003 --> 05:20.101
(Yells)

05:20.201 --> 05:22.200
(Sobs)

05:24.479 --> 05:26.798
(Yells)

05:31.995 --> 05:34.174
Fuck you!

05:34.274 --> 05:36.753
- (Mutters)
- (Yells)

05:40.351 --> 05:42.350
(Guard)
Get up!

05:44.788 --> 05:46.907
(Sobs)

06:03.818 --> 06:05.817
(Door clangs open)

06:14.093 --> 06:16.492
(Slow ticking clock)

06:40.919 --> 06:44.117
(Koba) Tell me about last night.
The fish market.

06:46.476 --> 06:50.054
One shooter. Male. Thirties.

06:50.154 --> 06:53.113
Maybe professional?

06:53.832 --> 06:55.831
Not very.

06:56.990 --> 06:59.069
You saw his face, yes?

07:03.267 --> 07:05.266
No?

07:06.026 --> 07:09.284
- Perhaps you...
- It was Billy Wallace.

07:09.384 --> 07:11.383
Sean's brother.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.300
Sean's brother?

07:19.019 --> 07:22.797
- Can you explain?
- I don't fucking know.

07:22.897 --> 07:25.096
You asked me to find a shooter,
and I did.

07:29.054 --> 07:32.452
Where did you go after? Hm?

07:36.969 --> 07:41.707
Where does Elliot go
after he helps kill Billy Wallace?

07:41.807 --> 07:44.266
Breakfast.

07:44.366 --> 07:46.464
Breakfast.

07:46.564 --> 07:48.184
- Breakfast.
- Hm.

07:48.284 --> 07:52.661
You know, toast.
Some herbal tea.

07:52.761 --> 07:57.039
(Sniffs)
Mm. Mm. Mm.

08:00.677 --> 08:02.676
I understand.

08:03.955 --> 08:08.713
You're like
a secret fucking agent.

08:09.752 --> 08:15.549
Who knows where you go...
what you really see?

08:19.627 --> 08:21.626
(Sniffs)

08:25.504 --> 08:27.503
(Exhales)

08:30.941 --> 08:37.997
You see any more Wallaces
out there... you let me know.

08:38.097 --> 08:43.934
Hm? Or I'll think you don't like me.

09:14.758 --> 09:16.757
- (Coughing)
- Billy.

09:19.795 --> 09:22.034
Take these.

09:34.868 --> 09:37.006
Thanks.

09:37.106 --> 09:38.605
(Coughs)

09:38.705 --> 09:40.484
(Sighs)

09:40.584 --> 09:42.683
Who were those shooters
last night?

09:42.783 --> 09:44.722
You walked into something.

09:44.822 --> 09:47.141
Yeah, no shit.
Have I said thanks?

09:48.101 --> 09:50.099
I'm not losing you both, Billy.

09:54.217 --> 09:55.437
(Sighs)

09:55.537 --> 09:59.175
- Yeah, Mum told me.
- Yeah...

10:01.334 --> 10:03.452
Were you following me?

10:03.972 --> 10:07.850
No. Following someone else.
You were just lucky.

10:09.050 --> 10:12.088
The guy at the fish market,
the hit, that was you?

10:14.687 --> 10:16.705
What the fuck is going on, Sean?

10:16.805 --> 10:21.263
In the car, you said one of the men
you came with went missing.

10:21.363 --> 10:23.362
One of Mum's men.

10:25.721 --> 10:29.899
Yeah. Darragh.

10:29.999 --> 10:32.257
He went to Luan. I don't...

10:32.357 --> 10:34.256
I need to speak to Mum.

10:34.356 --> 10:36.355
She in trouble?

10:46.950 --> 10:49.428
She'll have some questions.

10:52.627 --> 10:54.626
Your clothes are there.

11:00.063 --> 11:03.601
Darragh and Killian are still missing.
Luan's gone silent.

11:03.701 --> 11:06.100
- Koba's got to someone.
- And Billy?

11:06.899 --> 11:10.917
- We had a deal, Marian.
- Lennie's on his way back.

11:11.017 --> 11:14.055
- You said you could protect us.
- We're leaving.

11:16.294 --> 11:18.113
Or you can just run off
to your yacht

11:18.213 --> 11:19.952
and wait for them
to track you down.

11:20.052 --> 11:21.991
Just make sure
you leave money.

11:22.091 --> 11:25.149
If I wanted, I would have done it
a long time ago.

11:25.249 --> 11:29.767
Finn's money will always attract
attention. You know this.

11:30.807 --> 11:33.565
I know what war is, Marian.
I lived through one.

11:34.804 --> 11:39.262
If we hide now, we hit them hard next.
We don't back down.

11:39.362 --> 11:41.381
Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

11:41.481 --> 11:44.739
I saved your life, and in exchange
we promised each other

11:44.839 --> 11:47.458
power and strength.

11:47.558 --> 11:49.896
Do you remember
agreeing to that?

11:49.996 --> 11:52.795
- (Baby crying)
- She won't have the life I had.

11:53.994 --> 11:55.933
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

11:56.033 --> 11:59.651
Roze. Roze.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:59.751 --> 12:01.610
We all have plans for them.

12:01.710 --> 12:04.709
Then they grow up,
punch you in the face.

12:06.068 --> 12:09.146
Lennie's back. Get your things.

12:15.543 --> 12:17.042
Anything from Billy?

12:17.142 --> 12:19.981
I'll track every step he took.
I'll find him, I swear.

12:22.699 --> 12:25.718
(Phone rings)

12:25.818 --> 12:27.817
Billy?

12:30.935 --> 12:32.934
No, Mum. It's me.

12:37.292 --> 12:39.291
Who is this?

12:41.170 --> 12:43.169
It's Sean, Mum.

12:44.008 --> 12:46.007
It's Sean.

12:49.085 --> 12:52.484
I can't explain now.
You need to listen to me.

12:53.643 --> 12:55.642
Billy's safe.

12:57.121 --> 12:59.220
And you need
to get out of there.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.319
Koba's coming for you.

13:06.356 --> 13:08.355
Mum? Mum?

13:10.434 --> 13:13.633
Mum, are you there?
Speak to me, Mum.

13:14.432 --> 13:17.011
Mum, can you hear me?
You're in danger!

13:17.111 --> 13:19.110
Mum, you're in danger!

13:34.302 --> 13:36.301
(Rapid gunfire)

14:01.927 --> 14:04.486
- (Floriana) I have to get Roze!
- (Roze cries)

14:18.998 --> 14:21.397
(Groans) Roze!

14:23.276 --> 14:27.214
Roze's upstairs!
I have to get her!

14:27.314 --> 14:29.373
Come on, quick. That's it.
Get up, that's it!

14:29.473 --> 14:35.330
That's it, stay here. Stay here.
Stay there. Stay down.

14:35.430 --> 14:37.688
(Gunfire continues)

14:37.788 --> 14:40.227
- No!
- Roze.

14:44.825 --> 14:48.043
Pah, pah, pah.
Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah.

14:48.143 --> 14:51.321
Roze. Roze. Roze.

14:51.421 --> 14:53.420
(Sobs)

14:56.019 --> 14:57.678
(Yells)

14:57.778 --> 14:59.777
- (Roze cries)
- Roze!

15:01.216 --> 15:04.514
(Helicopter blades whir)

15:04.614 --> 15:06.273
(Koba)
Did you find her yet?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.492
Not yet, still looking.

15:10.571 --> 15:12.570
(Roze cries)

15:22.965 --> 15:25.923
(Yells)

15:34.878 --> 15:37.037
Roze, shh, shh.

15:42.514 --> 15:44.513
(Cries)

15:49.790 --> 15:52.729
Come on. Floriana, get up.
Get up, come on.

15:52.829 --> 15:54.888
- We've got to get out of here.
- Oh, Roze.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.987
Come on. Come on.

16:01.025 --> 16:03.023
- Give her to me.
- Here.

16:04.783 --> 16:07.501
(Helicopter blades whir)

16:12.698 --> 16:14.897
(Dramatic music)

16:15.737 --> 16:19.275
Lennie? Lennie?

16:19.375 --> 16:22.573
(Car engine starts)

16:24.212 --> 16:27.670
No, no. Run! I've got this.

16:27.770 --> 16:29.769
- Go! Go!
- Run.

16:32.048 --> 16:34.127
To the woods, out back.

16:38.845 --> 16:40.844
(Rapid gunfire)

16:52.917 --> 16:57.235
Fuck you, Marian. Fuck you.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.412
(Sighs)

17:02.512 --> 17:04.691
(Lale)
Are they with you yet?

17:04.791 --> 17:06.790
(Akam)
Not yet.

17:08.669 --> 17:10.788
I'm looking.

17:14.186 --> 17:16.465
(Lale)
Call me when you have them.

17:19.223 --> 17:21.222
(Akam)
I see them.

17:34.735 --> 17:36.734
(Radio playing heavy rock music)

17:42.171 --> 17:44.890
(Quiet dramatic music)

17:56.004 --> 17:58.483
(Yells)

17:59.562 --> 18:03.520
(Door flap opens,
tray clatters)

18:12.915 --> 18:14.914
Guard!

18:31.865 --> 18:35.703
You would like me to testify
before a British court...

18:37.102 --> 18:41.120
on everything I know
about the Investors.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.978
You would have
the full protection of the state.

18:45.778 --> 18:49.436
Your evidence
would be anonymous.

18:49.536 --> 18:51.715
You'd be a ghost.

18:51.815 --> 18:55.073
Afterwards, a new life.

18:55.173 --> 18:58.971
With certain restrictions.

19:01.450 --> 19:05.707
And you think that will remove
the Investors from London?

19:05.807 --> 19:08.306
With what's in your head,

19:08.406 --> 19:11.125
we'll hit them harder
than they've ever been hit.

19:12.844 --> 19:14.843
Well, you're fucking stupid.

19:16.562 --> 19:20.560
If you want them gone,
you have to take what they control.

19:21.559 --> 19:27.236
Street by street.
Gang by gang. Tower by tower.

19:28.555 --> 19:30.994
You'd have to destroy them
from the ground up.

19:33.113 --> 19:37.431
You need... a returning king.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.589
(Lock clunks, door creaks open)

19:58.340 --> 20:04.057
You blew up your father's city.
Now you want to be him.

20:05.296 --> 20:07.895
You're not as clever
as you think you are.

20:13.492 --> 20:18.249
The people who wanted
Sean Wallace dead...

20:19.089 --> 20:22.347
you've only just
brushed up against them.

20:22.447 --> 20:27.405
I've been on this for years.

20:30.483 --> 20:34.321
The city's changed.
The Investors have a new player.

20:35.440 --> 20:39.798
They won't see me coming.
Like you said, I'm a ghost.

20:43.956 --> 20:48.154
I'll need people from my world.
A gang.

20:53.271 --> 20:55.270
Where is she?

20:57.389 --> 20:59.388
Impossible.

21:01.067 --> 21:04.345
She's of high value to me.
A trading asset.

21:05.385 --> 21:07.383
(Sean)
To sell to her enemies?

21:08.743 --> 21:10.782
(Singer)
Politics.

21:11.301 --> 21:13.300
You're not
the whole picture here.

21:14.780 --> 21:16.898
Then no deal.

21:20.577 --> 21:22.576
You trust her?

21:26.653 --> 21:30.291
I said I need her.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.449
(Sean)
Her military training.

21:36.648 --> 21:38.647
Her people.

22:29.420 --> 22:31.419
Come.

22:40.135 --> 22:42.134
(Man)
Follow me.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.212
(Melancholic music)

24:01.692 --> 24:03.691
(Lale)
Go with Naza. Naza...

24:27.318 --> 24:29.437
(Sean)
I don't have clear memories.

24:30.517 --> 24:33.575
I remember Lale, her people,

24:33.675 --> 24:36.933
they pulled me
out of that hotel.

24:37.033 --> 24:39.032
(Marian)
Then what?

24:40.152 --> 24:42.510
They found someone
to put me back together.

24:43.990 --> 24:46.688
Lale's people did all that?

24:46.788 --> 24:48.687
Yeah.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.366
Why?

24:50.466 --> 24:52.805
I helped them, didn't I?

24:52.905 --> 24:55.643
They repay their debts.

24:55.743 --> 24:59.741
Listen to me.
Koba's got them by the neck now.

25:01.141 --> 25:03.799
(Sean) He takes a hefty cut
of their profits,

25:03.899 --> 25:08.237
and whilst they package his product,
he watches like a hawk.

25:08.337 --> 25:11.595
I need to get you
somewhere safer soon, Mum.

25:11.695 --> 25:14.174
How long have you been here?

25:15.293 --> 25:17.292
3 months.

25:18.731 --> 25:20.111
It had to be this way.

25:20.211 --> 25:21.990
All you had to do
was pick up the phone

25:22.090 --> 25:23.669
and tell us
you were still breathing.

25:23.769 --> 25:26.107
- It would have been a risk.
- I didn't even know you were alive.

25:26.207 --> 25:29.965
It was easier without
his fuck-up family. He's got a point.

25:33.364 --> 25:35.363
What have you
been doing exactly?

25:40.640 --> 25:45.697
The towers.
The money. The gangs.

25:45.797 --> 25:49.415
- I'm taking it all back.
- Did they fix your head right?

25:49.515 --> 25:51.534
- I mean it.
- With a bunch of terrorists?

25:51.634 --> 25:54.293
- Seriously?
- Others will join.

25:54.393 --> 25:58.191
Once they realise
Koba's not the future, I am.

25:59.870 --> 26:03.448
But you need to step back.
Koba's got inside your networks.

26:03.548 --> 26:05.547
You don't know who to trust.

26:07.906 --> 26:11.963
And if I'm to give shelter
to my father's girlfriend,

26:12.063 --> 26:14.142
I need to know
what you owe her.

26:17.780 --> 26:19.859
She saved my life.

26:22.658 --> 26:24.657
Then she's family.

26:25.416 --> 26:27.535
(Roze babbles)

26:29.494 --> 26:31.933
Here. Use this instead.

26:33.732 --> 26:35.731
Shh, shh.

26:36.770 --> 26:38.769
He wants to be king,
doesn't he?

26:40.768 --> 26:42.767
He's got
his little rebel army here.

26:43.927 --> 26:46.006
(Roze cries)

26:48.724 --> 26:51.303
Where does that leave you?

26:51.403 --> 26:53.482
(Shushing)

26:55.321 --> 26:57.060
Try and get some sleep.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.898
Don't pretend
this isn't happening.

26:59.998 --> 27:00.978
(Roze screams)

27:01.078 --> 27:03.496
He'll come to you,
ask for all the money,

27:03.596 --> 27:05.255
and that's when it's over.

27:05.355 --> 27:10.892
- That's not gonna happen.
- No. Because I won't say yes.

27:10.992 --> 27:12.991
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

27:18.908 --> 27:20.907
I'm Sean.

27:22.027 --> 27:26.024
- Is everything all right here?
- I've known worse.

27:27.064 --> 27:29.063
I bet.

27:31.422 --> 27:33.421
May I?

27:36.219 --> 27:38.638
(Shushing)

27:38.738 --> 27:40.937
Hello.

27:43.255 --> 27:46.294
I was expecting to see Dad
looking back at me.

27:48.053 --> 27:52.091
But no. Not the Wallace eyes.

27:55.209 --> 27:57.548
Lucky break.

27:57.648 --> 28:02.365
Roze. Shh, shh, shh.

28:13.919 --> 28:15.918
(Men arguing)

28:18.357 --> 28:20.576
(Lale)
What's going on?

28:20.676 --> 28:22.495
Koba's men took Rojan.

28:22.595 --> 28:24.594
What do they want?

28:29.151 --> 28:33.309
Rojan was selling on the side.
Koba must have found out.

28:36.667 --> 28:41.285
What choice do we have?
Koba takes most of our profits.

28:41.385 --> 28:43.044
There's not enough to send home.

28:43.144 --> 28:44.963
We agreed to be careful.

28:45.063 --> 28:46.922
Careful?

28:47.022 --> 28:50.100
What if Koba found
Marian Wallace here?

28:51.100 --> 28:53.099
Our deal was with Sean Wallace.

28:53.618 --> 28:56.377
- Not his family.
- I'll handle it.

29:00.535 --> 29:04.053
People have been talking
since you came back.

29:05.932 --> 29:09.130
Does she still know who she is?

29:30.719 --> 29:33.597
(Lale) This is a problem for us,
your mother being here.

29:35.596 --> 29:38.155
We'll find somewhere
for my family.

29:39.594 --> 29:42.693
My people can't continue
like this.

29:42.793 --> 29:44.991
We'll hit Koba
when the time's right.

29:47.510 --> 29:49.769
Patience is not the problem.

29:49.869 --> 29:53.127
They need faith that you can
deliver what you promised.

29:53.227 --> 29:55.846
You're under pressure.
I understand.

29:55.946 --> 29:58.145
They need faith in you.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.419
Why did you come back for me?

30:15.535 --> 30:18.914
You know too much.
I was protecting myself.

30:19.014 --> 30:21.412
That's good to know.

30:23.171 --> 30:25.670
If you want what you claim,
you must be prepared

30:25.770 --> 30:29.128
to do everything
without fear, without care.

30:31.327 --> 30:33.326
This is what it asks of you.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.599
(Indistinct speech in Kurdish)

30:54.315 --> 30:57.393
(Car horn blares)

31:04.350 --> 31:06.748
The Georgians are coming.

31:07.268 --> 31:08.967
They've got Rojan.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.066
(Lale)
Oh, shit.

31:12.425 --> 31:15.004
You need to hide. Come on.
Koba's men are here.

31:15.104 --> 31:16.763
- Quick.
- (Sean) What's going on?

31:16.863 --> 31:18.842
- Quick. Come on, come on.
- Mum, go.

31:18.942 --> 31:20.941
Go, go, go, go, go.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.499
Quick.

31:34.254 --> 31:36.453
Merwan...

31:37.372 --> 31:39.751
- How's life?
- Good.

31:39.851 --> 31:41.670
Happy wife, happy life, eh?

31:41.770 --> 31:43.549
(Chuckles)

31:43.649 --> 31:46.707
- I have a question.
- Mm.

31:46.807 --> 31:49.586
Are you happy
with the quality of the product?

31:49.686 --> 31:52.424
- Are the customers happy?
- Yes.

31:52.524 --> 31:55.303
(Tamaz) The hours your employees
are required to work,

31:55.403 --> 31:57.262
we negotiated that, yes?

31:57.362 --> 32:01.100
We asked for 10 hours a day.
That is acceptable?

32:01.200 --> 32:03.658
Stay here.

32:03.758 --> 32:07.297
The hourly rate,
is that a problem? No?

32:07.397 --> 32:09.375
No.

32:09.475 --> 32:12.474
So there's no general big problem
between us, correct?

32:15.752 --> 32:18.451
- No.
- No.

32:18.551 --> 32:20.550
(Whistles)

32:26.347 --> 32:28.046
(Naza)
Oh, my love. No, no!

32:28.146 --> 32:31.944
So... this thief...

32:33.343 --> 32:35.602
he's a small problem,
nothing more.

32:35.702 --> 32:36.681
Why?

32:36.781 --> 32:42.298
You never asked him to steal
because you are not unhappy, huh?

32:44.497 --> 32:49.454
He's your brother, yes?
I mean, real brother?

32:50.414 --> 32:52.993
- (Grunts)
- The same mother?

32:53.093 --> 32:55.231
You all call each other
brother, sister.

32:55.331 --> 32:57.330
- I'm just checking.
- He's my brother.

32:59.049 --> 33:01.228
- Hey...
- (Merwan) No.

33:01.328 --> 33:04.347
I think your brother
is lying to me.

33:04.447 --> 33:05.986
No.

33:06.086 --> 33:08.964
Oh! You want to take his place.

33:12.442 --> 33:15.321
No. No, no...

33:17.080 --> 33:19.079
(Tamaz)
Okay!

33:20.038 --> 33:21.138
Give your hand.

33:21.238 --> 33:23.317
(Merwan)
No. No, no.

33:24.516 --> 33:27.494
No, Tamaz. No.

33:27.594 --> 33:31.033
- No!
- (Screams)

33:35.190 --> 33:38.069
- (Sobs)
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

33:50.143 --> 33:54.520
Please tell your workers,
the shift is now 12 hours.

33:54.620 --> 33:56.759
Eh.

33:56.859 --> 33:59.837
We deliver more,
you package more.

33:59.937 --> 34:02.136
Win, win.

34:05.534 --> 34:07.533
Let's go.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.452
(Shushing)

34:15.329 --> 34:17.828
(Singer) How's it progressing
with the Kurds?

34:17.928 --> 34:21.826
Koba's becoming
a bigger problem for us.

34:21.926 --> 34:24.105
I've got it under control.

34:24.205 --> 34:27.023
And your father's girlfriend
working with your mother?

34:27.123 --> 34:30.062
(Sean)
I said I'm handling it.

34:30.162 --> 34:33.120
(Singer) The window to retaliate
is closing, Sean.

35:07.582 --> 35:09.581
Sorry.

35:12.979 --> 35:15.018
Do you want me to...?

35:22.814 --> 35:26.132
- (Roze cries)
- Shh.

35:38.006 --> 35:40.305
Do you want her to be like us?

35:40.405 --> 35:42.523
You think I shouldn't be here?

35:43.403 --> 35:44.902
You can do what you like.

35:45.002 --> 35:49.420
My father was a gambler.
He ran bets for the mafia.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.719
He didn't want to,
but you don't say no.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.716
Then he said no.

35:59.035 --> 36:01.154
They shot him in the head
in our kitchen.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.491
My little brother too.

36:05.591 --> 36:07.830
So he wouldn't grow up
and take vengeance.

36:09.629 --> 36:12.248
I know what this world is.

36:12.348 --> 36:14.387
Roze.

36:17.905 --> 36:19.984
How well
do you know my mother?

36:21.703 --> 36:23.822
Maybe I know
some things you don't.

36:25.581 --> 36:29.379
Then you'll know that
she'll screw you over in the end.

36:41.612 --> 36:42.832
(Knocking on door)

36:42.932 --> 36:44.671
(Sniffs)

36:44.771 --> 36:45.750
(Knocking)

36:45.850 --> 36:48.609
(Merwan)
Lale, the elders have called a meeting.

36:50.568 --> 36:53.266
We need to discuss the Wallaces.

36:53.366 --> 36:55.365
(Receding footsteps)

37:02.322 --> 37:04.320
(Merwan)
Sean.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.559
After you.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.828
I'm told you're unhappy.
How can I make you happy?

37:33.145 --> 37:37.743
The actions of your mother,
Luan, this does not help us.

37:39.942 --> 37:43.200
Koba smells rebellion,
so he pushes us.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.359
There is too little profit
to send home.

37:45.459 --> 37:48.277
(Lale) We're not the same
as others in this city, yeah?

37:48.377 --> 37:51.436
Those who want power
for its own sake.

37:51.536 --> 37:54.474
My people want freedom
in our homelands.

37:54.574 --> 37:58.792
If our business here fails,
as it fails now,

37:58.892 --> 38:00.471
for us there are other cities,

38:00.571 --> 38:02.510
other ways
to continue the struggle.

38:02.610 --> 38:04.469
Your business won't fail.

38:04.569 --> 38:07.187
When Koba's gone,
you'll have a place in this city.

38:07.287 --> 38:09.146
I promised you that.

38:09.246 --> 38:11.245
(Man)
Too slow.

38:18.921 --> 38:21.820
I said I'd hit anyone
who sides with Koba.

38:21.920 --> 38:25.058
That's not enough now.
It's time to escalate.

38:25.158 --> 38:27.357
We'd like
to share your confidence.

38:28.996 --> 38:30.995
Yeah, we need each other.

38:34.593 --> 38:37.092
But you need us more.
Without us, you're alone.

38:37.192 --> 38:39.890
I'll give you money
to send home.

38:39.990 --> 38:42.089
I'll give you weapons
for the fight ahead.

38:42.189 --> 38:44.628
These things are yours to give?

38:46.347 --> 38:48.786
Your mother
has her own ambitions, no?

38:51.504 --> 38:54.822
Like I said, you have my word.

38:56.222 --> 38:58.221
Then let us see.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.579
(Fast-paced dramatic music)

39:25.087 --> 39:27.805
(Music builds)

39:42.477 --> 39:44.476
(Bones crack)

39:45.436 --> 39:47.435
(Music fades)

39:48.554 --> 39:50.533
(Crashing)

39:50.633 --> 39:53.312
- (Beeping)
- (Groans)

40:18.698 --> 40:20.557
(Elliot)
I remember this.

40:20.657 --> 40:24.455
Street grunt, isn't it?

40:25.815 --> 40:27.814
Hands up.

40:30.692 --> 40:32.691
Front seat. Come on.

40:43.485 --> 40:46.024
Thought I'd be
higher up your kill list.

40:46.124 --> 40:47.423
(Sean sighs)

40:47.523 --> 40:50.562
Funny. I was told
you were off limits.

40:53.800 --> 40:57.678
Joseph Singer.
He was very insistent.

40:59.877 --> 41:04.274
Turns out you and I
are on the same side. For now.

41:07.353 --> 41:12.310
I do not give a fuck
about you or Singer.

41:13.629 --> 41:17.827
But Koba would. Especially
as you've been killing his new friends.

41:19.946 --> 41:21.525
(Sighs)

41:21.625 --> 41:23.924
See this here?

41:24.024 --> 41:28.382
The surgeon said
a hair either way and, pff...

41:30.820 --> 41:32.819
Miracle, really.

41:34.578 --> 41:37.937
Then I thought,
did he mean to do it?

41:39.296 --> 41:43.514
That's very Elliot.
Anything for a clean conscience.

41:43.614 --> 41:45.393
Say thank you.

41:45.493 --> 41:46.992
You're such a good liar.

41:47.092 --> 41:49.710
You even fall
for your own bullshit.

41:49.810 --> 41:55.168
I asked for the worst case,
you know. Finn's file was huge.

41:57.287 --> 42:00.465
Money laundering,
extortion, conspiracy,

42:00.565 --> 42:03.923
ABH, GBH, murder,
kidnap, trafficking.

42:06.362 --> 42:10.080
Yours... was empty.

42:11.079 --> 42:14.817
Nothing. No one cares.

42:14.917 --> 42:17.456
You're an irrelevance.

42:17.556 --> 42:19.375
You're not your dad

42:19.475 --> 42:21.734
and you don't know
how to do any of this.

42:21.834 --> 42:23.833
You finished?

42:25.712 --> 42:29.729
Singer said you're back in,
but you want out.

42:29.829 --> 42:33.188
Make your mind up.
We both know why you're really here.

42:33.987 --> 42:36.286
You and I want the same thing.

42:36.386 --> 42:38.885
To rid this city
of the Investors.

42:38.985 --> 42:43.462
So either help me or fuck off.

42:50.578 --> 42:52.577
Go on, then.

42:54.536 --> 42:57.035
You're right.

42:57.135 --> 42:59.834
Don't have to.
You're all hiding under one roof.

42:59.934 --> 43:01.933
Could just give Koba
Lale's address,

43:03.332 --> 43:06.250
and that's all the Wallaces
in one, right?

43:14.046 --> 43:15.665
We're not on the same side.

43:15.765 --> 43:17.764
(Car door shuts)

43:23.921 --> 43:25.920
(Car engine starts)

43:38.114 --> 43:40.112
Where's Sean?

43:42.071 --> 43:46.589
He says you and your people
saved his life.

43:47.469 --> 43:49.607
What's in this for you,
Lale, hm?

43:49.707 --> 43:53.046
Must have killed you
to see me walking back in here.

43:53.146 --> 43:56.104
Thought you had him wrapped
around your little finger, didn't you?

44:02.501 --> 44:04.620
This is hard for you, isn't it?

44:06.139 --> 44:08.138
What is?

44:08.777 --> 44:11.996
He's not scared of you anymore.

44:12.096 --> 44:14.814
He's waiting for you on the roof.

44:28.807 --> 44:32.005
Sean, what's going on?

44:33.524 --> 44:35.523
Where the fuck have you been?

44:38.002 --> 44:40.221
I lied about
what happened to me.

44:40.321 --> 44:43.579
- I want you to listen closely.
- No.

44:43.679 --> 44:48.157
You listen to me.
I've had enough.

44:49.196 --> 44:51.675
One more lie out of your mouth
and we're done.

44:57.872 --> 45:03.129
After I was shot,
I wasn't with Lale's people.

45:03.229 --> 45:05.488
I was taken by someone else.

45:05.588 --> 45:08.306
I was a captive. Lale too.

45:10.505 --> 45:12.964
The Investors
have other enemies.

45:13.064 --> 45:15.322
Some of them
inside our government.

45:15.422 --> 45:17.561
They're secretive
and they're few,

45:17.661 --> 45:19.880
and they want the Investors out.

45:19.980 --> 45:21.979
They and I want the same thing.

45:23.738 --> 45:25.777
What are you after?

45:27.056 --> 45:30.035
I want you to know everything.
I want a clean slate between us.

45:30.135 --> 45:32.134
No.

45:33.413 --> 45:35.812
What do you want?

45:38.810 --> 45:40.709
(Dramatic music)

45:40.809 --> 45:42.808
I want you to give me
Dad's money.

45:44.567 --> 45:46.566
And I want your arms contacts.

45:48.605 --> 45:50.864
Can you do that?

45:50.964 --> 45:54.302
You and Floriana,
how does it work?

45:54.402 --> 45:56.401
Forget it.

45:57.440 --> 46:00.339
She controls the accounts.
Your father saw to that.

46:00.439 --> 46:03.137
So how does it work, then?
Do you beg?

46:03.237 --> 46:06.176
She helped me when there was
nobody else around for me.

46:06.276 --> 46:09.814
- I can't just take everything from her.
- Grown sentimental in your old age.

46:09.914 --> 46:11.933
- Fuck off.
- I'm the one you don't trust!

46:12.033 --> 46:15.771
- Bloody right I don't trust you, Sean.
- I'm sorry.

46:15.871 --> 46:19.169
No, you're not. You're only sorry
you're having to beg for what's mine.

46:19.269 --> 46:23.487
- I should have told you I was alive.
- Yes, you should have!

46:23.587 --> 46:25.665
- I thought you were dead.
- I'm sorry.

46:27.704 --> 46:30.323
- I'm sorry.
- You crucified me!

46:30.423 --> 46:33.921
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:34.021 --> 46:37.139
(Sobs)

46:39.738 --> 46:41.737
Sorry.

46:43.496 --> 46:47.954
There were days
and weeks and months,

46:48.054 --> 46:52.411
inside what was left of my head,
when I forgot who I was.

46:57.369 --> 46:59.368
But I know now.

47:00.247 --> 47:02.246
I'm a Wallace.

47:03.086 --> 47:06.804
I'm a fucking Wallace,
all or nothing.

47:08.123 --> 47:12.241
And I'm gonna protect us
and get what we deserve.

47:25.594 --> 47:27.833
(Music builds)

47:32.350 --> 47:36.488
Be patient. You'll receive
the money soon, okay?

47:36.588 --> 47:38.587
When? When? I don't know when.

48:03.694 --> 48:06.472
(Floriana)
Your people need help.

48:06.572 --> 48:10.850
If you're looking to Sean Wallace,
it would be a mistake.

48:18.246 --> 48:20.765
I can offer you something better.

48:23.484 --> 48:25.482
I have the means.

48:26.362 --> 48:28.361
And the connections.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.239
Shall I continue?

48:35.597 --> 48:37.596
There would be a condition.

49:04.902 --> 49:06.601
What?

49:06.701 --> 49:08.700
Can I tell you a secret?

49:11.298 --> 49:13.297
Dad was scared of you.

49:14.257 --> 49:16.256
He knew
you were smarter than him.

49:18.934 --> 49:21.093
You got lost on purpose,
didn't you?

49:22.852 --> 49:24.851
So he'd never want you involved.

49:25.971 --> 49:27.970
You see people for what they are.

49:30.128 --> 49:32.127
You don't miss a trick, do you?

49:38.804 --> 49:43.122
I need you here,
watching my back.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.358
Will you do that, Billy?

49:55.795 --> 49:57.794
Yeah, I will.

50:07.709 --> 50:09.708
Thank you.

50:13.066 --> 50:15.065
Thank you.

50:21.382 --> 50:23.380
Come with me.

50:38.692 --> 50:40.691
(Approaching footsteps)

51:00.721 --> 51:04.119
I've spoken
with Lale and Merwan.

51:05.638 --> 51:08.517
From now on,
I will support their business.

51:12.395 --> 51:14.394
Is this true?

51:19.671 --> 51:21.690
Well, you're a busy devil.

51:21.790 --> 51:24.069
You would have done this to me.

51:24.908 --> 51:26.987
So what would you like me
to do now?

51:28.786 --> 51:30.785
Leave.

51:35.103 --> 51:37.841
You could have had
what you wanted.

51:37.941 --> 51:39.440
But you're afraid to do it.

51:39.540 --> 51:41.539
(Gunshot)

51:43.978 --> 51:46.417
(Screams echo)

51:55.692 --> 51:57.431
(Gun clicks)

51:57.531 --> 51:59.930
(Empty shells clatter)

52:07.646 --> 52:09.105
(Door opens)

52:09.205 --> 52:11.204
You'll have what I promised.
