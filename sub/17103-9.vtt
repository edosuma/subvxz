00:04.872 --> 00:07.241
( theme music playing )

01:39.267 --> 01:41.702
- ( thunder rumbling )
- ( panting )

01:45.206 --> 01:48.309
( beast growling )

01:50.711 --> 01:52.580
( groaning )

01:56.584 --> 02:00.221
( distant carnival music
playing )

02:02.690 --> 02:05.359
( gasps, panting )

02:50.238 --> 02:52.340
JUMPIN' JESUS.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.478
OSGOOD!

02:59.680 --> 03:02.316
YOU WERE ON
CROSSPINS YESTERDAY.

03:02.416 --> 03:06.387
SAMSON PULLED ME OUT
TO CLEAN UP THE BACK END.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.522
WHO TOOK YOUR PLACE?

03:08.622 --> 03:12.360
- I DIDN'T NOTICE.
- NO IDEA, HUH?

03:12.460 --> 03:15.796
JONESY, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
IT'S NO ONE'S FAULT.

03:15.896 --> 03:19.733
ACCIDENT'S ONE THING,
STUPID'S SOMETHING ELSE.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.003
Ben:
WHY ARE WE STOPPED?

03:23.103 --> 03:25.839
THESE JUNK HEAPS
NEED A REST.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.541
SO DOES THE CREW.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.110
BUT WE'RE OVER
THE STATE LINE NOW

03:30.210 --> 03:31.879
SO THE NEBRASKY COPS
CAN'T GET US,

03:31.979 --> 03:34.582
OR WHOEVER ELSE
HAS A MIND TO.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.818
HOW LONG ARE WE
STAYING FOR?

03:37.918 --> 03:41.889
JUST TILL MORNING.
WE'LL STRIKE OUT
AT FIRST LIGHT.

03:43.424 --> 03:46.660
I KNOW YOU GOT
THE EAGERS.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.965
BUT I AIN'T GONNA
LOSE THAT BET.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.904
YOU PUT A DOWEL IN IT,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.441
- HELL NO, I DIDN'T.
- ANY FOOL KNOWS YOU DON'T
SWAP IRON FOR WOOD.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.476
IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT
IN THERE, WHO DID?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.813
YOU'RE THE ONE ALWAYS SAYING
LET'S MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
FOR THE CLEMS.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.483
- MAYBE YOU DID IT
AND FORGOT ABOUT IT!
- YOU GODDAMN--!

04:12.353 --> 04:15.456
ALL RIGHT,
BREAK IT UP!

04:22.229 --> 04:24.665
WELL, DON'T LOOK
AT ME!

04:24.765 --> 04:26.967
HE'S THE ONE ACTING
ALL FUZZY-HEADED

04:27.067 --> 04:29.670
SINCE HE HITCHED UP
WITH THAT WHORE
WIFE OF HIS.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.872
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!
- COME ON!

04:31.972 --> 04:33.407
( groaning )

04:33.507 --> 04:36.410
BURLEY,
YOU LOCK YOUR JAW.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.620
Samson:
HE'S A MAROON.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.990
PULL IN YOUR HORNS.
LET IT GO.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.826
LET IT GO.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.862
( sighs )

04:57.465 --> 05:00.534
( Justin groans )

05:00.634 --> 05:04.372
Justin:
HE HAUNTS ME.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.608
DO YOU REMEMBER THE NIGHTMARES
I SUFFERED AS A BOY?

05:08.409 --> 05:11.779
THE LAUGHTER,
THE TERROR.

05:13.180 --> 05:16.083
AND THAT WHEEL,
SPINNING.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.452
ENDLESSLY SPINNING.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.888
I KNEW IT THEN.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.125
THE CARNIVAL...

05:25.225 --> 05:27.928
HIDES MY ENEMY

05:28.028 --> 05:30.398
EVEN AS HE DRAWS CLOSER.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.667
HE MEANS TO DESTROY US.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.408
PRAY WITH ME, NORMAN.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.811
PRAY.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.088
HI, HANDSOME.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.460
HERE, COVER YOURSELF.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.335
OH, I GET IT.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.737
WHAT?

06:09.837 --> 06:13.206
- I EMBARRASS YOU.
- NO, IT AIN'T LIKE THAT.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.608
- IT'S JUST--
- JUST WHAT?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.210
YOU CAN'T JUST GO AROUND
PARADING IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.012
- I AIN'T PARADING.
- OKAY, FINE.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.449
SIT, STAND,
JUMP UP AND DOWN.
I DON'T CARE.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.116
JUST COVER YOURSELF
WHILE YOU DO IT.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.453
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES,
JONESY, THEM BOYS
AIN'T SEEN ME

06:25.553 --> 06:29.590
- ABOUT 100 MILLION TIMES--
- IT'S DIFFERENT NOW!
YOU'RE MARRIED.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.361
SO'S MY MA.

06:34.462 --> 06:38.899
I DON'T HEAR MY DADDY
TELLING HER WHAT TO WEAR.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.605
I AIN'T YOUR DADDY.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.542
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!

06:51.545 --> 06:54.482
( distant radio
playing music )

07:13.667 --> 07:16.504
( Scudder groaning )

07:30.551 --> 07:32.920
HELP ME.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.108
( panting )

09:38.278 --> 09:40.681
( Jones snoring )

10:10.844 --> 10:13.747
( footsteps
approaching )

10:15.382 --> 10:17.818
- ( men whispering )
- ( whispers ) WHO'S OUT THER?

10:17.918 --> 10:20.253
( whispers continuing )

10:23.590 --> 10:25.625
OH, QUIT YOUR FOOLING.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.961
- ( muffled screaming )
- Man: SHUT UP, BITCH!

10:28.061 --> 10:30.130
LIB?

10:31.699 --> 10:33.566
( man whispers )
GRAB HIS HANDS.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.069
HOLD HIM.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.738
( fire crackling )

10:37.838 --> 10:41.441
Man 2:
YOU DON'T KNOW ME,
DO YOU, CARNY TRASH?

10:41.541 --> 10:45.746
YOUR MAN KILLED MY WIFE
ON THAT GODDAMN FERRIS WHEEL.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.215
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
GOD DAMN IT!

10:50.017 --> 10:53.520
- SHOULD WE GIVE HER
THE TREATMENT TOO?
- NO, I WANT HER TO SEE.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.655
( Libby sobbing )

10:55.756 --> 10:57.991
SO SHE CAN GO BACK
AND TELL THOSE FREAKS

10:58.091 --> 11:01.895
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU COME IN
AND WRECK DECENT FOLK.

11:08.902 --> 11:12.072
- OPEN YOUR EYES, BITCH.
- YOU LEAVE HER BE!

11:13.974 --> 11:16.744
- NO-NO! ( screaming )
- ( sizzling )

11:20.613 --> 11:22.315
YOU BETTER LOOK,
LITTLE MISSY,

11:22.415 --> 11:24.684
OR YOU'LL GET SOMETHING
A HECK OF A LOT WORSE!

11:24.785 --> 11:28.188
- MAKE HER OPEN THEM!
- LET HER GO, DAMN IT!

11:28.288 --> 11:30.623
YOU'VE GOT A BIG MOUTH,
YOU KNOW THAT?

11:30.724 --> 11:33.393
( choking )

11:33.493 --> 11:35.395
( screaming )

11:36.797 --> 11:37.965
( gurgling )

11:38.065 --> 11:39.833
( Libby sobbing,
screaming )

11:39.933 --> 11:42.569
STOP!
NO! STOP!

11:42.669 --> 11:44.304
NO! STOP!

11:44.404 --> 11:46.673
NO!

11:46.774 --> 11:49.176
PLEASE!

12:02.155 --> 12:04.057
THERE.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.860
CHEYENNE.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.829
THAT'S RIGHT DOWN
THE HIGHWAY.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.900
IF YOU SKIN FOR IT,
I'LL WAGER YOU'D MAKE IT
IN TWO, THREE HOURS, TOPS.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.306
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAKE SOME MUSCLE?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.575
UH, IT'S BEST IF I
SNEAK UP ON THEM ALONE.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.977
YOUR CALL.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.613
Ben:
I JUST PRAY
I GET THERE IN TIME.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.515
HAWKINS?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.286
STRIKE LUCKY.

12:48.135 --> 12:52.139
- GOOD MORNING, SOFIE.
- GOOD MORNING, MISS.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.776
BROTHER JUSTIN IS
A SIMPLE MAN

12:56.877 --> 13:00.513
WITH SIMPLE VIRTUES,
SIMPLE TASTES.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.983
TOAST IS DRY.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.986
COFFEE BLACK,
NO SUGAR.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.292
THAT'S BETTER.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.562
YES, MA'AM.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.540
HAVE YOU SEEN ELEANOR?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.276
NOT SINCE YESTERDAY.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.145
THAT'S ODD.
SHE'S USUALLY
HERE BY NOW.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.347
IF YOU'D LIKE,
I COULD WALK DOWN
TO THE VALLEY

13:34.447 --> 13:38.085
- AND SEE IF I CAN FIND HER.
- OH, YOU HAVE PLENTY TO DO
UP HERE, SOFIE.

13:38.185 --> 13:42.155
- I KNOW.
- YOU SERVE AT MY BROTHER'S
PLEASURE, DEAR.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.159
( swallows )

13:46.259 --> 13:48.295
I WILL, MISS.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.884
OF COURSE,
ONCE YOU GET PAST
THE STRIKING REPETITION,

14:10.984 --> 14:13.153
IT'S REALLY QUITE BANAL.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.388
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS OVERRATED.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.058
- ( Justin chuckling )
- ( door closes )

14:18.158 --> 14:20.793
"BLESSED ARE THE MEEK."
( laughing )

14:20.894 --> 14:23.196
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.570
Justin:
OH, WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

14:31.771 --> 14:33.406
FLOWERS.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.708
A BREATH OF SPRING.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.578
ISN'T THAT NICE,
NORMAN?

14:49.322 --> 14:51.891
HE LOVES COFFEE.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.471
IT'S SOFIE, ISN'T IT?

15:04.571 --> 15:06.473
YES, SIR.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.976
THAT'S A LOVELY NAME.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.912
SOFIE.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.599
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.536
NO.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.571
NO, THANK YOU.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.946
( chuckling )

16:11.371 --> 16:13.440
( groaning )

16:30.623 --> 16:32.525
( coughs )

16:32.625 --> 16:34.727
( panting )

16:38.165 --> 16:41.101
( knocks at door )

16:42.535 --> 16:44.737
I'M COMING.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.013
( knocks )

16:54.114 --> 16:57.284
Lila:
RUTHIE?
RUTHIE, IT'S LILA.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.219
OPEN UP.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.123
WHAT?

17:03.223 --> 17:06.193
GOOD LORD, WOMAN,
WHAT YOU GOT ON YOU?

17:07.994 --> 17:09.796
NOTHING...

17:09.896 --> 17:11.764
LIPSTICK.
I WAS CLEANING.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.166
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:13.266 --> 17:15.302
I JUST BROUGHT YOU OVER
SOME OF MY BISCUITS.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.270
- I DON'T LIKE BISCUITS.
- YOU SURE?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.506
PROFESSOR WAS ALWAYS
VERY PARTIAL TO THEM.

17:19.606 --> 17:23.776
- SO?
- SO MAYBE YOU WOULD
LIKE THEM TOO.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.664
( sobbing )

18:51.298 --> 18:53.566
THIS IS FOR U.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.105
YOU VOTE DEMOCRAT NOW.
YOU VOTE FOR VAL.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.807
ALL RIGHTY.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.109
HOWDY, PARTNER.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.478
Iris:
EXCUSE ME.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.883
- HAVE YOU SEEN ELEANOR?
- SHE HASN'T BEEN BY
ALL DAY, MA'AM.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.852
THANK YOU.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.858
Rita Sue:
THEY'RE GONE.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.327
VANISHED.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.762
YOU SAID THEY'S STUFF
IS STILL THERE.

19:22.862 --> 19:27.033
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
OUR BABY MARRIED A GIMP,
NOW HE'S A KILLER TOO.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.702
( laughing )
WELL, THAT WASN'T
HIS FAULT.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.572
WHO SAID IT WASN'T HIS FAULT?
I HEARD HE WAS DRINKING.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.376
HELL'S BELL'S, HE'S RUN
THAT OLD WHEEL 1000 TIMES,
DRUNK AND SOBER.

19:36.476 --> 19:40.313
THE OLD CONTRAPTION IS
ONLY HELD TOGETHER WITH SPIT
AND BALING WIRE ANYWAY.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.549
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO SLOUGH BLAME.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.918
WHY ARE YOU STICKING UP
FOR HIM, ANYWAY?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.221
( chuckling )
WELL, HE'S FAMILY.

19:48.321 --> 19:52.659
- PLEASE DON'T CALL HIM THAT.
- MAYBE THEY'RE HAVING A PICNIC.
I DON'T KNOW.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.495
A PICNIC?

19:55.595 --> 19:57.430
YOU REMEMBER WHEN
WE WAS NEWLYWEDS.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.432
WE'D STEAL OFF
EVERY CHANCE WE'D GET.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.569
LOOK AROUND, EDISON.
THERE AIN'T BUT SAND
AND SCRUB FOR MILES.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.404
WHERE ARE THEY GONNA
HAVE A PICNIC?

20:04.504 --> 20:06.339
WHEREVER THEY LAY
THEIR BLANKET DOWN.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.140
DON'T WORRY.
THEY'LL BE BACK.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.210
AND WHEN THEY DO,
I BET JONESY'S ASS IS
SPORTING A SUNBURN!

20:11.311 --> 20:13.746
( laughing )

20:16.549 --> 20:18.751
AH.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.892
( buzzard squawking )

21:07.400 --> 21:09.602
( soft grunt )

21:22.315 --> 21:24.751
( groaning )

21:27.286 --> 21:30.990
( Jones wheezing )

21:32.892 --> 21:34.961
( sniffing )

21:35.928 --> 21:38.531
I'LL STOP DANCING.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.636
I'LL DO WHAT EVER YOU
WANT ME TO DO.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.476
I PROMISE.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.347
PLEASE DON'T DIE.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.337
( buzzards squawking )

22:24.844 --> 22:27.414
Man on P.A.:
If you haven't
signed up yet,

22:27.514 --> 22:29.749
you want to come on down

22:29.849 --> 22:32.351
It will take five minutes
of your time.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.286
You'll be glad you did.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.755
Come on down here.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.591
I want you to get
registered to vote.

22:52.238 --> 22:55.141
Eleanor:
PLEASE, THE LIGHT.

22:59.345 --> 23:02.782
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.185
I'M TRULY, TRULY SORRY,
MISS IRIS.

23:06.285 --> 23:08.755
( stammering )

23:08.855 --> 23:12.459
- I DON'T FEEL WELL.
- YOU LOOK AWFUL.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.130
- ( gasps )
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

23:20.633 --> 23:23.803
THERE'S NO FEVER.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.839
WHAT IS IT, DEAR?
WHAT'S WRONG?

23:29.609 --> 23:31.578
I SAW THE DEVIL.

23:31.678 --> 23:34.581
OH, DEAR ELEANOR.
NOT THE--

23:34.681 --> 23:38.317
BROTHER JUSTIN--
HIS EYES WERE BLACK AS PITCH.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.320
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.490
I'VE SEEN OTHER THINGS

23:43.590 --> 23:46.325
I DIDN'T TELL
NOBODY ABOUT.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.662
HUSH.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.599
NOW, WHAT DOES THE LORD
SAY ABOUT LYING?

23:53.199 --> 23:55.367
I AIN'T LYIN'.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.470
ELEANOR.

24:00.306 --> 24:04.343
"THOU SHALT NOT BEAR
FALSE WITNESS."

24:04.443 --> 24:06.679
THAT'S RIGHT.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.820
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

24:26.933 --> 24:30.603
THIS IS JUST
EXHAUSTION SPEAKING,
NOTHING MORE.

24:30.703 --> 24:34.340
YOU HAVE BEEN
OUR HARDEST WORKER,
ELEANOR.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.943
YOU NEED A DAY OFF.

24:41.748 --> 24:44.483
I HAVE A WONDERFUL IDEA.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.623
( buzzard squawking )

25:09.609 --> 25:12.244
GO AWAY!

25:13.379 --> 25:15.214
GET OUT OF HERE!

25:38.705 --> 25:41.040
( vehicle approaching )

25:57.289 --> 25:58.891
AH, HELL.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.593
HEY!

26:00.693 --> 26:03.029
HEY! STOP!

26:12.138 --> 26:14.841
JONESY'S DYING.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.513
OH, JESUS.

26:21.614 --> 26:24.050
WE GOT TO GET HIM
TO A HOSPITAL.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.653
HE AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT
TO NO HOSPITAL.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.955
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM
HERE TO DIE.

26:29.055 --> 26:32.224
THE NEXT TOWN IS CHEYENNE.
IT'S 40-SOME MILES OFF!

26:33.960 --> 26:36.195
PLEASE.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.812
- ( Jones gagging )
- HE AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT!

27:25.912 --> 27:28.815
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

28:14.493 --> 28:17.029
JUST LOOK AT
YOUR FACE, ELEANOR.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.631
I CAN SEE THE TENSION
FLOATING AWAY.

28:19.732 --> 28:24.603
NOTHING SETTLES THE SOUL
LIKE SEEING GOD'S HANDIWORK,
IT'S TRUE.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.307
I COME HERE MYSELF
SOMETIMES...

28:29.508 --> 28:31.210
WHEN I'M TROUBLED,

28:31.310 --> 28:33.980
ALONE,

28:34.080 --> 28:36.448
CONFUSED.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.955
WHAT I SAW...

28:49.728 --> 28:53.465
WAS ALMOST LIKE
A BAD DREAM.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.769
YES.
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS,

28:56.869 --> 28:59.638
A VERY BAD DREAM.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.073
A TRICK OF THE EYE

29:01.173 --> 29:06.478
CREATED BY ANXIETY,
EXHAUSTION.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.782
BUT THE GOOD PART
ABOUT BAD DREAMS

29:09.882 --> 29:12.118
IS THAT THEY END,

29:12.218 --> 29:17.389
AND YOU CAN WAKE UP
RENEWED AND REFRESHED.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.499
MISS IRIS?

29:28.367 --> 29:30.036
ELEANOR?

29:36.108 --> 29:39.511
YOU'VE BEEN MIGHTY GOOD
TO ME AND MINE.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.117
YOU WERE RIGHT.

29:48.754 --> 29:51.523
MAYBE I WAS JUST TIRED.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.960
YES.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.228
I'M A SILLY OLD WOMAN.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.663
( laughing )

29:57.763 --> 29:59.565
( guffawing )

30:06.638 --> 30:08.674
OH, THANK YOU, MISS IRIS.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.910
I FEEL AS LIGHT AS AIR.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.544
THAT'S GRAND.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.313
( laughing )

30:14.413 --> 30:16.916
I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO TELL
BROTHER JUSTIN!

30:17.016 --> 30:19.451
TELL HIM WHAT, DEAR?

30:19.551 --> 30:21.888
ABOUT WHAT I SAW.
THE DEVIL.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.589
( laughing )

30:23.689 --> 30:25.324
HE'LL THINK IT'S A HOOT.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.626
WELL, HE MIGHT TAKE
THAT THE WRONG WAY.

30:27.726 --> 30:29.028
PISH-POSH.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.297
- WELL, ELEANOR--
- HE'LL THINK IT'S FUNNY.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.632
HE HAS SUCH A GREAT
SENSE OF HUMOR.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.167
IT WOULD GIVE HIM
A GOOD LAUGH.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.104
AND AFTER ALL THAT POOR MAN'S
BEEN THROUGH LATELY,

30:38.204 --> 30:40.306
LORD KNOWS,
HE COULD USE ONE--

30:49.448 --> 30:51.850
( grunting )

31:09.801 --> 31:11.938
HELP ME.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.175
GRAB HIS FEET.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.977
HURRY UP!

31:18.077 --> 31:21.247
( Jones moaning faintly )

31:26.285 --> 31:28.787
- NOW GET IN THE TRUCK.
- NO!

31:28.887 --> 31:30.722
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE HIM!
- I AIN'T LEAVING HIM!

31:30.822 --> 31:31.857
YOU ARE!

31:31.958 --> 31:33.559
- WHAT?
- DO LIKE I SAY!

31:33.659 --> 31:36.595
YOU GET IN THE TRUCK
AND YOU DRIVE LIKE HELL
BACK TO THE ROAD!

31:36.695 --> 31:39.198
YOU LOCK UP ALL THE WINDOWS!
YOU LOCK THE DOORS!

31:39.298 --> 31:41.767
YOU WAIT FOR ME.
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T GET OUT.

31:41.867 --> 31:44.937
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- SOMETHING IS GONNA
HAPPEN HERE!

31:45.037 --> 31:48.007
I DON'T GOT TIME
TO EXPLAIN IT!

31:48.107 --> 31:51.043
I CAN'T RISK
YOU GETTING HURT!

31:51.143 --> 31:53.612
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE
HE'S GOT!

31:53.712 --> 31:56.015
NOW GET IN THE TRUCK!

32:02.454 --> 32:03.956
GO ON, GET!

32:24.243 --> 32:26.645
Val:
We must seek
to end the reign

32:26.745 --> 32:28.547
of this man
in the White House

32:28.647 --> 32:31.883
who is an agent
of the international Shylock!

32:31.984 --> 32:37.956
This great country
of ours faces a choice,
my friends,

32:38.057 --> 32:41.860
BETWEEN
THE NEW DEAL RED FLAG

32:41.960 --> 32:44.063
OR THE STARS AND STRIPES!

32:44.163 --> 32:48.534
I WILL NEVER
ALLOW COMMUNISM,

32:48.634 --> 32:49.935
OR FASCISM,

32:50.036 --> 32:52.271
OR GOD FORBID,
MODERNISM

32:52.371 --> 32:56.042
TO OVERTHROW THE DECENCIES
OF PRIVATE LIFE,

32:56.142 --> 32:58.210
TO USURP PROPERTY

32:58.310 --> 33:02.514
AND DISRUPT
THE TRUE ORDER OF LIFE.

33:02.614 --> 33:06.185
WE CHRISTIANS
IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD

33:06.285 --> 33:09.588
ARE READY TO GO
TO THE BARRICADES

33:09.688 --> 33:11.990
FOR BUT ONE "ISM"--

33:12.091 --> 33:13.892
AMERICANISM!

33:13.992 --> 33:16.362
( cheering )

33:24.170 --> 33:26.638
WHERE DID YOU
DISAPPEAR TO?

33:26.738 --> 33:29.808
MERELY DOING YOUR DUTY.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.777
TIME WELL SPENT THEN.

33:31.877 --> 33:34.646
THIS NEW GIRL,
WHERE DID YOU FIND HER?

33:34.746 --> 33:37.949
THE CAMP. WHY?
ISN'T SHE WORKING OUT
EITHER?

33:38.050 --> 33:41.387
QUITE THE CONTRARY.
HER FACE IS INSPIRING.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.996
I WANT TO LEAD
THIS NEW AMERICAN REVOLUTION!

33:51.097 --> 33:53.532
AND THAT IS WHY TODAY

33:53.632 --> 33:59.671
I AM DECLARING MY CANDIDACY
TO BE YOUR NEXT CONGRESSMAN!

34:02.508 --> 34:04.810
( cheering )

34:18.390 --> 34:22.528
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
BLESSED ARE THE POOR
IN WALLET,

34:22.628 --> 34:25.664
FOR THEIRS WILL BE
THE KINGDOM HERE ON EARTH!

34:25.764 --> 34:28.134
( cheering )

34:30.336 --> 34:33.905
BLESSED ARE THE MIGRANTS
AND THE OKIES AND THE ROADITES,

34:34.005 --> 34:36.608
for they are
the true Americans!

34:36.708 --> 34:39.077
( cheering )

34:40.812 --> 34:43.182
AMEN! AMEN!

34:47.085 --> 34:49.455
BLESSED ARE
THE RIGHTEOUS MEN,

34:49.555 --> 34:51.923
FOR THEY SHALL BE
REWARDED--

34:52.023 --> 34:53.792
IN WASHINGTON!

35:09.608 --> 35:13.512
AND BLESSED ARE THOSE
WHO BELIEVE IN US,

35:13.612 --> 35:17.749
FOR WE ARE THE TRUTH,
AND THE LIGHT

35:17.849 --> 35:19.751
AND THE WISDOM.

35:24.156 --> 35:26.892
- INDEED, WE ARE--
- ( gunshot )

35:26.992 --> 35:28.760
( screaming )

35:31.062 --> 35:33.732
Cop:
THAT'S ENOUGH!

35:44.676 --> 35:49.715
( shouts )
I COMMAND THEE, STOP!
( breathing heavily )

35:57.756 --> 35:59.157
GET AWAY!

35:59.258 --> 36:02.594
GET AWAY!
DO NOT TOUCH THIS MAN!

36:04.896 --> 36:06.832
( whispers )
NORMAN.

36:11.503 --> 36:17.543
BLESSED ARE THOSE
THAT UNDERSTAND AND FORGIVE!

36:22.381 --> 36:24.916
- Man: PRAISE THE LORD!
- Man 2: HALLELUJAH!

36:25.016 --> 36:27.953
- AMEN!
- ( crowd cheering )

36:30.188 --> 36:32.824
PRAISE YOU, JESUS!

36:51.810 --> 36:53.712
THAT'S RIGHT.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.830
( wheezing )

37:12.964 --> 37:15.634
( murmuring )

37:28.314 --> 37:31.750
- Umpire: BALL THREE!
- ( crowd cheering )

37:34.386 --> 37:36.922
FORGET IT.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.157
BASES LOADED.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.893
THREE WALKS IN A ROW.
YOU'RE DONE, JONESY.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.995
I'M ONE STRIKE
AWAY, BILL.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.532
I'M BRINGING IT
HOME.

37:48.534 --> 37:52.137
Coach:
YOU WALK THIS GUY,
YOU WALK HOME.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.306
THAT'S 500 MILES.

37:54.406 --> 37:58.444
I AIN'T WALKING.
AND NEITHER IS HE.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.810
- Umpire: STRIKE THREE!
YOU'RE OUT!
- ( yells ) YEAH!

38:31.910 --> 38:32.844
( hooting )

38:32.944 --> 38:34.346
( mumbles )
YAHOO!

38:37.182 --> 38:39.551
( buzzards squawking )

38:42.488 --> 38:45.290
HEY.
DON'T TRY TO TALK.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.759
( muttering )

39:25.030 --> 39:28.534
I AM SO VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, NORMAN.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.904
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:33.739 --> 39:36.942
DO YOU REALLY HATE ME SO?

39:48.386 --> 39:51.022
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE
THIS CONFUSED.

39:57.763 --> 40:01.066
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE
TO KILL ME...

40:04.536 --> 40:06.938
AND YOU FAILED.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.669
( grunts )

41:12.604 --> 41:14.873
( groaning )

41:39.297 --> 41:41.933
( panting )

42:02.387 --> 42:04.723
HAWKINS?

43:06.184 --> 43:09.120
YOU DID THIS?

43:12.190 --> 43:13.759
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

43:13.859 --> 43:17.663
EVERYTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
TILL IT AIN'T.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.966
YOU ARE A HEALER.

43:21.066 --> 43:23.702
THAT'S PART OF IT.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.538
ONE OF THEM SAINTS?

43:27.639 --> 43:29.708
NO.

43:30.742 --> 43:33.378
YOU AIN'T AN ANGEL.

43:33.478 --> 43:36.014
I AIN'T NO ANGEL,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.072
WHAT?

44:01.172 --> 44:04.309
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.013
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

44:09.214 --> 44:10.548
YOU GOT A KNIFE?

44:10.648 --> 44:12.517
GIVE ME YOUR KNIFE.

44:12.617 --> 44:15.020
GIVE ME YOUR KNIFE.
COME ON.

44:58.663 --> 45:00.698
WHOO!

45:00.799 --> 45:03.201
( laughing )

45:10.275 --> 45:12.710
WHOO-HOO!

45:23.855 --> 45:25.757
( shouting )

45:25.857 --> 45:28.226
( snoring lightly )

45:31.863 --> 45:33.999
( footsteps approaching )

45:41.773 --> 45:44.009
( whispers )
NORMAN.

46:01.459 --> 46:03.862
I NEED
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

46:05.997 --> 46:08.766
I WAS PROUD OF WHAT
YOU DID TODAY.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.770
SUCH COURAGE.

46:14.906 --> 46:17.575
ONLY YOU AND I KNOW
HIS TRUE NATURE.

46:17.675 --> 46:20.478
OUR KNOWLEDGE
IS HIS WEAKNESS.

46:22.013 --> 46:24.782
AND WE MUST KEEP
THAT SECRET SAFE.

46:26.384 --> 46:28.486
NO ONE WILL KNOW.

46:29.855 --> 46:32.190
I'VE MADE SURE
OF THAT.

46:34.692 --> 46:37.863
WE WILL CHOOSE
OUR TIME, NORMAN.

46:38.864 --> 46:41.499
THEN WE WILL
EXPOSE HIM.

46:44.469 --> 46:47.072
BUT UNTIL THEN...

46:51.076 --> 46:53.945
IT WILL BE
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

47:03.588 --> 47:06.491
( humming lullaby )

48:49.860 --> 48:52.330
YOU TOOK HIM
IN YOUR ARMS.

48:56.067 --> 48:58.603
HOW COULD YOU
FORGIVE HIM?

48:59.804 --> 49:02.240
HE HAS BEEN LIKE
A FATHER TO ME.

49:02.340 --> 49:05.576
BUT THAT ONLY MAKES
WHAT HE DID WORSE.

49:05.676 --> 49:07.212
MUCH WORSE.

49:07.312 --> 49:11.316
AND THAT IS WHY FORGIVENESS
IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT.

49:14.919 --> 49:17.122
YOU'RE A GREAT MAN.

49:17.222 --> 49:19.457
NO.

49:19.557 --> 49:21.526
I'M JUST A MAN.

49:28.933 --> 49:33.671
IT IS GRACE
THAT MAKES US GREAT...

49:33.771 --> 49:36.107
MAKES US
CHILDREN OF GOD...

49:39.477 --> 49:41.412
MAKES US HUMAN.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.618
COME.
SIT WITH ME.

49:59.164 --> 50:04.069
SOFIE, I WANT YOU
TO FORGIVE EVERYONE,

50:04.169 --> 50:07.605
ANYONE THAT'S EVER
HARMED YOU IN THE PAST.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.050
I CAN'T.

50:19.617 --> 50:21.586
YOU MUST.

50:28.926 --> 50:31.262
I WILL HELP YOU.

50:52.583 --> 50:54.785
LET US PRAY.

51:28.052 --> 51:31.522
( theme music playing )
