WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:03.044
(chattering)

00:03.128 --> 00:05.672
STAN: So, Stan Jablonski.

00:07.632 --> 00:10.719
And what does Stan Jablonski,
22 years at Polk Avenue do

00:10.802 --> 00:12.387
on day one at Hill Street?

00:12.971 --> 00:14.139
Let's be realistic.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.183
Maybe three or four of you heard rumors.
Let me tell you one thing.

00:17.517 --> 00:22.480
Stan Jablonski never cold-cocked no woman.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.149
Okay?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.193
-That's it.
-(man coughs)

00:27.277 --> 00:30.071
I mean... just ask yourselves.

00:30.363 --> 00:35.410
If Jablonski assaults a female superior
officer without adequate provocation,

00:35.493 --> 00:37.996
would he be standing here before you now,
or would he be up on charges?

00:38.079 --> 00:40.457
In which case
what you could have been hearing

00:40.540 --> 00:43.001
would be a lot of lies and provocations

00:43.376 --> 00:46.087
spread by a troubled individual

00:46.171 --> 00:48.256
who happens right now
to be on psychiatric leave

00:48.339 --> 00:51.217
in order to assassinate
Jablonski's 29-year career.

00:51.718 --> 00:52.552
Okay.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.512
(rattles)

00:54.596 --> 00:55.430
Items.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.391
Your new street sergeant--

00:58.475 --> 01:00.351
No, let's get it out in the open
once and for all

01:00.435 --> 01:02.062
and then it's quits with this.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.480
The facts are...

01:03.563 --> 01:08.860
after seven years' continual provocations
and non-stop slurs,

01:08.943 --> 01:13.823
Lieutenant Vera Horvath on Jablonski's
second to last day at Polk Avenue

01:13.907 --> 01:17.243
and note, this is after he had
already put in for his transfer,

01:17.327 --> 01:22.248
Lieutenant Vera Horvath calls him out
in front of a total stationhouse,

01:22.332 --> 01:25.043
"Come on Jablonski,
let's finally see what you got."

01:25.126 --> 01:27.712
"Pass, Lieutenant," says Jabo,

01:27.796 --> 01:30.173
no ifs ands or buts.

01:30.256 --> 01:33.051
But then, who's out there in front
of the precinct house waiting for him

01:33.134 --> 01:34.552
when he goes out
and steps in front of him...

01:34.636 --> 01:36.513
-(J.D. laughs)
-...when he tries to walk around-- Hey!

01:36.596 --> 01:38.098
What's so funny back there?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.059
-(murmurs)
-(laughter)

01:41.142 --> 01:42.560
All right, enough!

01:46.106 --> 01:47.565
But this you can take to the bank.

01:47.649 --> 01:51.653
With Jablonski, if we go,
we don't go Marquis of Queensbury.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.073
So yes, Lieutenant Horvath
initiated the contact,

01:55.156 --> 01:59.244
and yes I delivered her one to the chops,
but no I never cold-cocked her.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.789
Stach Jablonksi never
cold-cocked no woman.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.749
Got a little blood pressure.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.336
(glass thuds)

02:08.920 --> 02:09.838
Items.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.217
Before our female contingency
gets all heated up,

02:14.884 --> 02:17.512
Sergeant Bates is returning
to motor patrol duty

02:17.595 --> 02:21.850
-of her own free will.
-(cheering, applauding)

02:22.475 --> 02:25.770
Filling the sergeant slot
created by adding the Jefferson renewal

02:25.854 --> 02:27.272
to the Hill Street precinct.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.941
Riding with her is gonna
be Officer "Kofi" Kofi?

02:30.650 --> 02:32.861
-Coffey.
-Uh, Coffey.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.780
That's, uh, Sector Charlie. Item two.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.949
So going in, am I your partner
or your driver?

02:38.408 --> 02:39.242
Partner.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.787
...summer heat wave, says crime goes up
when it gets hot. (scoffs)

02:42.996 --> 02:46.541
Item three.
The mayor's Victim's Aid pilot program

02:46.624 --> 02:49.169
includes Hill Street as of today.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.880
We share our counselor
with the other precinct.

02:51.963 --> 02:56.676
Now, they catch cases off the paperwork,
so it's extremely imperative

02:56.885 --> 03:01.472
that copies of the 612-greens,
the 914-salmons

03:01.556 --> 03:04.893
get routed to them through the, uh,
through the khaki office.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.396
Item, uh, four.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.525
The Operation Flea Bag begins
operation this a.m.

03:12.609 --> 03:18.656
Detectives Belker, uh, LaRue,
Washington...

03:18.948 --> 03:22.202
They're gonna be undercover
in our local five-star hotel,

03:22.285 --> 03:23.786
the Hotel Stratford.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.080
Our boy keeps a room down there, Sergeant.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.877
STAN: The object is to lock up the fences,
hookers, junkies, et cetera,

03:30.960 --> 03:33.630
who've made this place
the crime hub of North Dekker.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.465
Second possible object...

03:36.966 --> 03:38.468
close the whole toilet down.

03:38.718 --> 03:43.181
Item five:
to all personnel, from Captain Furillo.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.060
"As you know, convicted rape
murder Celestine Gray

03:47.143 --> 03:49.896
is scheduled to be executed
tomorrow evening.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.982
Various lawyers and investigators
representing him

03:53.066 --> 03:57.820
may be making last-minute inquiries
regarding matters of record in this case."

03:57.904 --> 03:59.322
Please be cooperative.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.032
Last, I, uh...

04:01.783 --> 04:03.785
-I got a note here.
-(paper rustles)

04:05.787 --> 04:06.621
(chuckles)

04:06.704 --> 04:08.039
Officer Renko?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.167
Uh, yes, sir, that would be me, Sarge.

04:11.834 --> 04:15.129
I understand you could be expecting
to be with child today.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.257
(cheering, applauding)

04:17.340 --> 04:18.299
Okay!

04:18.549 --> 04:22.637
All other units, you be prepared
to back Hill and Renko up, okay?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.181
That's it. Let's get out there.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.558
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.519
(chattering)

04:29.852 --> 04:31.854
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't forget,

04:32.272 --> 04:35.275
Stach Jablonski never
cold-cocked no woman.

04:35.358 --> 04:39.487
(laughter, chatter)

04:41.823 --> 04:43.992
(telephone ringing)

04:44.075 --> 04:46.411
Hey, Leo. Did you do
something to your hair?

04:46.494 --> 04:47.370
Maybe.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.872
I think it's really great
you've lost all this weight.

04:49.956 --> 04:50.790
Thanks.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.959
But your hair looks like you combed it
with a tire pump.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.252
RENKO: Will you look at this?

04:54.335 --> 04:57.672
"We the undersigned oppose
this barbaric act

04:57.755 --> 04:59.590
of state murder, yadda, yadda, yadda.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.843
Including Lieutenant Henry Goldblume.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.886
Now, you tell me how a ranking officer
of this department..."

05:03.970 --> 05:06.264
Free speech, Renko.
That's still constitutional.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.765
Yeah, I'll tell you what it constitutes.

05:07.849 --> 05:11.477
It constitutes a lack of virile plumbing,
as far as I'm concerned.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.730
Anybody else?

05:14.647 --> 05:16.065
Go ahead, take a shot.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.610
I have never expressed
interest in retirement.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.446
Why do they send me such a letter?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.406
They must no longer
consider me promotable.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.617
Midlife career switch is all the rage,
Ray. Maybe you'll catch the wave.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.328
PHIL: Detectives Garibaldi and Mayo,

05:28.411 --> 05:31.247
robbery and assault, two seniors,
2400 block of Dekker.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.915
(chattering)

05:35.626 --> 05:37.378
Vera, we're quits. (yells)

05:37.670 --> 05:38.504
(groans)

05:39.047 --> 05:41.883
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:41.966 --> 05:43.634
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:43.718 --> 05:47.513
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:47.597 --> 05:49.223
(sirens wailing)

05:54.687 --> 05:57.315
(theme music playing)

07:11.848 --> 07:13.975
(police siren wailing)

07:27.405 --> 07:28.489
It's a mess.

07:58.853 --> 07:59.687
What do we have?

08:00.188 --> 08:02.356
Single assailant unknown to the victims,

08:02.648 --> 08:05.193
entered just after midnight
through the bathroom window.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.863
Terrorized them six
and three quarter hours.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.907
Tied them up, ransacked.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.494
Made the wife watch while
he repeatedly assaulted the male victim,

08:14.577 --> 08:17.371
James Parsons, age 73, with a chair.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.126
Then he shot him in the neck and abdomen
shortly before flight.

08:23.419 --> 08:27.215
Also assaulted, Annie Parsons,
age 72, wife of James.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.719
You have any description?

08:32.053 --> 08:35.223
Male, Caucasian, five-seven,
dark blue or black pants,

08:35.556 --> 08:38.351
cutoff sweatshirt, 20 maybe 25.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.478
Sounds like he was on dust.

08:46.025 --> 08:46.943
Victim's gonna make it?

08:48.069 --> 08:50.154
Woman's got a bruised rib. She'll be okay.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.907
Husband's critical at Mercy.
Looks like touch and go.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.367
Through in the kitchen, Detective.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.954
-MAYO: What about the fridge?
-Nothing but prunes and stuff.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.499
He was in here all night. If he got
hungry, he touched all that stuff.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.879
Great way to start a day, huh?

09:10.091 --> 09:11.217
Good work, Patsy.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.344
Thanks.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.562
-Captain.
-Stan. Welcome.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.523
-What's with the eye?
-Oh, little incident, Captain.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.733
-Other one works just fine.
-It's good to have you here.

09:27.817 --> 09:31.028
On the senior assault, Mercy says
the bullet got the old guy's spine.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.072
-APB out?
-Plus the 45.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.490
All right, as much manpower as possible,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.325
authorize two detective units.
Keep me posted.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.077
-Yes, sir.
-HENRY: Frank.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.788
-Seen the paper this morning?
-Damn right I did.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.124
-Interested in my side of it?
-Henry, if you don't mind,

09:43.207 --> 09:45.710
I'd like to have my own word
with this reporter first.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.254
Frank, Frank, may I talk
to you a minute, please?

09:48.337 --> 09:50.965
-Seen this paper, Ray?
-Not yet.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.426
I wanted to ask you about this letter
I got from division.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.927
"Anatomy of an Execution.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.722
Celestine Gray case
and its impact on the people involved.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.308
Gray's execution today
in the brutal rape-murder

10:00.391 --> 10:02.518
of Sister Anna was
finally set one week prior.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.645
The married couple
whose professional lives

10:04.729 --> 10:06.939
have taken them
to opposite poles on the case,

10:07.023 --> 10:09.650
Furillo and his public defender wife,
Davenport, separated."

10:09.734 --> 10:11.193
How could he put
those two things together?

10:11.277 --> 10:13.321
-He hasn't talked to either one of us.
-I don't know, Frank.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.281
If I could trouble you
for a minute, please?

10:18.576 --> 10:21.787
Uh, excuse me one second,
would you please, Ray?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.789
Certainly, Frank.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.211
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.048
Braden'll be picking up my cases today.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.799
-Who's that?
-New PD.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.593
Don't eat him for lunch, okay?

10:35.968 --> 10:38.262
I'm buried
with last-minute stuff on Celestine.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.723
-Have you seen this?
-I did.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.601
That's a cheap shot,
that stuff about us, don't you think?

10:43.976 --> 10:45.978
I guess maybe there's
a grain of truth in it.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.230
Joyce, Celestine Grey
isn't the reason we separated.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.523
No, he isn't.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.319
Three o'clock this morning,
I couldn't remember why we did.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.696
-What were you doing up?
-Thinking about my client.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.823
Missing you.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.408
Do you want to have dinner?

11:00.493 --> 11:03.037
-After tomorrow night.
-Whenever.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.664
After would be better, okay?

11:08.376 --> 11:11.003
Funny, we've got people
working in three states.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.506
There's a shot at a Supreme Court stay.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.925
And I'm making all my plans
on the assumption

11:16.008 --> 11:17.468
the poor bastard's gonna be gone.

11:18.719 --> 11:19.970
(papers rustling)

11:21.430 --> 11:23.683
-WOMAN: Stop!
-(police siren wails)

11:23.766 --> 11:25.851
-Stop!
-LUCY: The man with the cart!

11:25.935 --> 11:28.354
WOMAN: He stole my ice! Stop!

11:31.190 --> 11:33.567
-Whoa.
-Good day, officer, is there a problem?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.403
What's all the ice for?

11:35.486 --> 11:37.530
-I'm having a party for my mother.
-I see.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.156
-It's her birthday.
-Nice.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.742
(panting) So he empties my ice chest,

11:41.826 --> 11:44.203
and then he motors past
the checkout doing about 30.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.747
-Did you pay for the ice?
-What is ice? Water, right?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.290
Do you pay for water in a restaurant?

11:48.374 --> 11:49.959
-What are you, crazy?
-Just take it easy.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.544
Now, tell me how much
you charge for the ice.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.213
Seventy-five cents a bag and it's melting
while we're talking here.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.424
-Okay, 75 times--
-Gotta be 20 bags here.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.134
-Okay, two times 75--
-Fifteen bucks.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.844
-I don't have that kind of money.
-Hey, hey.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.053
How much do you have?

12:03.889 --> 12:04.890
A dollar-fifty.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.559
All right, pay the lady.

12:06.642 --> 12:07.810
You're not a swindler.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.020
Here, have a party.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.525
-Hey. Hey, wait a minute.
-(radio chatter)

12:14.608 --> 12:18.028
-What if I want to press charges?
-Look, don't push it, lady.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.531
You want to stand here?
It's gonna all melt, right?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.367
The guy matching the Parson assailant.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.871
(police siren wailing)

12:26.954 --> 12:30.624
(radio chatter continues)

12:36.172 --> 12:37.089
LUCY: Alley!

12:37.631 --> 12:38.966
(tires screech)

12:41.093 --> 12:44.555
Suspect's headed northbound,
Freeland Alley. In pursuit.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.142
(police siren wailing continues)

12:50.060 --> 12:51.312
Take this on.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.566
Hold it right there!

12:56.484 --> 12:57.985
COFFEY: Up against the wall!

12:58.068 --> 13:00.488
-Move!
-Hey, what's the story, man?

13:00.571 --> 13:02.490
-Turn around, turn around!
-(clangs)

13:02.573 --> 13:04.074
-Attempted murder.
-And drugs.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.911
Wait. Hey! I didn't murder anybody, man!

13:07.453 --> 13:10.164
(police siren wailing)

13:11.332 --> 13:14.126
RIKERS: Sometimes you get your derelict
types congregating in here

13:14.210 --> 13:18.088
as opposed to your welfare bum types,
which, by and large, are your main trade.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.131
Learn to know the difference,

13:19.215 --> 13:20.257
so you don't have to give them
the heave-ho.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.175
Okay.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.928
Your main proposition's
a simple proposition.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.181
They plunk down the nine bucks,
you give 'em a key, a towel,

13:27.264 --> 13:29.725
turn one of your alarm clocks on,
put it in a cubbyhole.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.435
When the alarm goes off, you call 'em.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.854
Anybody give you a hard time,
don't mess around.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.856
-You got a carry permit?
-Yeah.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.317
-I used to be a night watchman.
-Okay.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.487
If Tony had used this, he wouldn't be dead
and you wouldn't have this job.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.656
Whack 'em across the nose if you have to.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.741
-With me so far?
-Oh, yeah.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.995
-(man coughing)
-(growls)

13:50.079 --> 13:52.081
-What was that?
-What?

13:52.164 --> 13:54.750
That growling. That was good,
I like that. Do that again.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.710
(both growling)

13:57.711 --> 13:59.171
Trying to tell you,

13:59.255 --> 14:03.092
you got a dead corpse
up on the stairs there.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.761
-Where?
-On the fourth floor.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.724
(telephone rings)

14:11.600 --> 14:12.768
Not again.

14:15.145 --> 14:15.980
Ugh!

14:16.730 --> 14:17.731
Dead.

14:18.899 --> 14:19.900
Goodbye.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.741
-Wait. Grab his feet.
-Why?

14:27.825 --> 14:30.411
-Because I said to, that's why.
-What are you doing?

14:30.494 --> 14:31.662
You gonna give me a hand or what?

14:31.745 --> 14:33.122
Mr. Rikers, you can't just throw him out.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.207
How many years you been
running this place, anyways?

14:35.291 --> 14:38.586
-I'm not asking you to like it.
-No, no, no. This ain't right.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.922
-(body thuds)
-Is a dead junkie, okay?

14:42.006 --> 14:44.884
Not Abraham Lincoln.
A dead junkie in one of my rooms

14:44.967 --> 14:48.387
with cops, medical examiners,
three hours out of my life,

14:48.470 --> 14:49.847
plus two days I lose the room,

14:49.930 --> 14:52.683
plus it hurts my status
with the welfare department.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.811
A dead junkie in the alley
is 20 minutes max.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.771
This is the lesser of two evils.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.774
Kid, take my word,
the fall ain't gonna hurt him.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.827
So Nathan says
we can take some stuff, so I--

15:11.911 --> 15:13.829
-(loud crash)
-(cat yowling)

15:14.246 --> 15:15.164
Hey. Hey.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.708
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.962
Let's see what you got here, Roland.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.763
You, uh, have a death in the family?

15:30.846 --> 15:32.139
Kind of in a hurry, okay?

15:32.473 --> 15:33.766
Bill and a half, bro.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.851
Two bills. I need two.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.774
Feel that. That feel a little hot to you?

15:41.857 --> 15:42.691
Ow!

15:43.025 --> 15:44.318
Okay.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.949
-Bill and a half, let's go.
-Okay, bro.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.495
J.D.: Cheer up, Roland.
people are starving in Europe.

15:55.412 --> 15:58.082
Hey, you want to be on our mailing list?

15:59.208 --> 16:01.543
Roland Maxwell, stolen goods received.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.253
(telephone rings)

16:03.545 --> 16:05.422
I want to talk to a detective.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.882
About what, ma'am?

16:07.299 --> 16:09.385
Celestine Gray didn't kill that nun.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.886
HENRY: What did you say?

16:11.387 --> 16:14.098
Some other dude killed the nun.
Celestine was with me.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.434
Would you come with me, ma'am, please?

16:22.940 --> 16:23.774
Thank you.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.694
(door closes)

16:28.237 --> 16:30.239
I was with Celestine that whole night.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.909
Tamar, Sister Anna
wasn't murdered at night, it was morning.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.744
All night and all morning.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.871
Don't try no tricks on me.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.749
What was your relationship with Celestine?

16:41.458 --> 16:42.668
We lived together.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.253
Why'd you wait till now to come forward?

16:44.878 --> 16:45.963
Because we had a fight.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.340
He stole from me and I was mad.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.218
But I don't want him to die.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.556
Tamar, you also known as Talia Collins?

16:56.432 --> 16:57.349
What's that?

16:57.433 --> 17:01.186
Talia Collins or Talia Conway. Either one.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.230
Talia.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.526
Yeah, maybe some peoples on the street.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.194
Why is that?

17:09.611 --> 17:13.532
Because Talia Collins told the same story
to assistant DA Bernstein.

17:14.033 --> 17:14.908
Before trial.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.454
He didn't believe you
because you were serving a 90-day sentence

17:18.537 --> 17:21.373
in the women's house of detention
when Sister Anna died.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.292
(folder closes)

17:26.253 --> 17:28.672
-I wasn't in jail then.
-(door opens, closes)

17:29.423 --> 17:32.092
No way. No, sir.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.264
Well, why should one of 'em
live and the other one die?

17:38.390 --> 17:41.351
It ain't fair. No way that's fair.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.270
Gerald gonna live!

17:43.771 --> 17:45.856
Why does Celestine got to die?

17:50.569 --> 17:52.738
-(telephone ringing)
-(chattering)

17:53.280 --> 17:55.824
-STAN: Can I help you, ma'am?
-I'm looking for Sergeant Bates.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.244
Sergeant Bates is back on the street.
I'm Sergeant Jablonski.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.873
Oh. Well, I'm with the Victims'
Aid Bureau. Fay Furillo.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.210
Yes ma'am, Mrs. Furillo,
I got the memo right here.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.128
Do you think you could show me to a desk?

18:08.212 --> 18:11.632
I see that you're going to
be splitting your time with Polk Avenue.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.758
That's correct. Could I--?

18:12.841 --> 18:15.177
I don't know whether you've been down
to Polk Avenue yet, ma'am,

18:15.260 --> 18:16.553
but I just came from there,

18:16.637 --> 18:19.223
and a person could hear things
about an individual there

18:19.306 --> 18:21.100
that wouldn't necessarily be true.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.434
I don't want to go into it.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.395
I just want to say that in every situation
there's my story,

18:25.479 --> 18:27.731
her story, and the truth.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.193
My story's the truth. So, okay?

18:31.777 --> 18:35.030
Okay. Listen, really, all I want to do
is put these books down on a desk.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.783
-Hey. Hi, we've been expecting you.
-Hi.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.868
STAN: I'll find that desk
for you now, Mrs. Furillo.

18:39.952 --> 18:40.953
Oh, thank you.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.706
I understand you have
friends in high places.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.167
Well, when the funding ran out
for the unwed mothers program

18:47.251 --> 18:49.837
the mayor was kind enough
to slide me right over here.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.754
Thank you very much.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.923
Well, if anybody's qualified,
I'd say you are.

18:53.423 --> 18:56.510
-Couple muggings, three arrests.
-Not exactly what I meant.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.304
Captain, we've got Mrs. Parsons
on line four.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.764
-Thanks.
-Listen, Frank,

19:01.181 --> 19:03.392
I thought long and hard
before taking this,

19:03.475 --> 19:06.019
and there's one thing I want to get
straight right from the start.

19:06.728 --> 19:10.190
This job is very important to me,
not just because it's a living,

19:10.274 --> 19:12.818
but because I feel I can make
a contribution as well.

19:13.443 --> 19:17.698
But I want you to understand
that there is absolutely no way on earth

19:17.781 --> 19:19.950
I am going to intrude
in your personal life.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.286
I mean, our paths
don't even have to cross.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.246
I appreciate you saying that, Fay.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.748
You know, the Hill's been waiting
for this program for five years.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.126
I think you're an excellent choice
for the job.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.043
Thank you.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.046
By the way, I read
that piece in the paper this morning.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.798
How are things between you two?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.593
(telephone ringing)

19:40.137 --> 19:41.138
(door opens)

19:42.973 --> 19:43.974
Turn to your left.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.684
(door closes)

19:50.147 --> 19:51.023
Turn back center.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.117
Mrs. Parsons, can you identify
any of these men?

20:03.911 --> 20:04.745
Can I...

20:05.704 --> 20:07.456
Can I hear them speak?

20:07.539 --> 20:10.417
My client won't consent to voice,
not without a court order.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.797
(stutters) I have cataracts.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.424
I'm sorry.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.638
Captain? What should I do
with the suspect?

20:22.721 --> 20:24.514
Book him on possession
and check out his alibi.

20:24.598 --> 20:27.476
Frank, how you doin'? Did Joyce tell you?

20:27.559 --> 20:30.312
PDs office hired my agency
on Celestine Gray.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.314
Don't get me wrong,
I think the guy's a stinker,

20:32.397 --> 20:35.651
-but work's work, right? (chuckles)
-The job's going away, Jer.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.236
I mean, the guy doesn't deserve to live,

20:37.319 --> 20:39.738
but it'd be funny
if Fuchs Security Service

20:39.821 --> 20:42.866
-saved it for him, wouldn't it, Frank?
-Very funny, Jerry, excuse me.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.830
Just a minute, Mrs. Parsons,
and then we'll be out of here.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.379
J.D.: Hey, Leo, here's stolen goods A.
Junkie's name is Phil.

20:55.462 --> 20:58.090
And here's videotape A, goes with it.

20:58.173 --> 21:01.343
Here's B, name of Roland Maxwell,
videotape B.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.011
-From the Hotel Stratford?
-Mm-hmm.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.888
They got a regular swap meet
going on over there.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.683
Got a set of candle holders,
probably brass.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.769
What's this here? Medal of some kind.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.480
That's a Silver Star
from World War Two. Let me see.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.441
J.D.: Yeah? My dad had a Purple Heart.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.612
Excuse me, please.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.949
-What does it say?
-Sorry?

21:24.032 --> 21:26.827
-What year?
-1943.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.122
-May I see it, please?
-Surely.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.375
NEAL: Patsy, want to check this?

21:35.335 --> 21:38.005
-Mrs. Parsons?
-(crying) It's James.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.134
This is James. Where did you get it?

21:44.594 --> 21:45.846
Down at the Stratford.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.098
That man took this from my husband.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.850
-What's the deal?
-Our rob-assault, Parsons.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.394
If we get the books down,
will you recognize this junkie?

21:52.477 --> 21:54.104
Piece of cake. Roland Maxwell.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.232
Yo, Harry. You pick him up, okay?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.276
-So we won't blow our cover.
-Yeah, no problem.

21:59.359 --> 22:03.822
Could somebody please take me back
to the hospital?

22:03.905 --> 22:05.157
We can do that, ma'am.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.744
(breathing rapidly)

22:10.245 --> 22:11.246
I don't know, Bobby.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.290
You attend all them breathing classes,

22:13.373 --> 22:15.250
read all them books and magazines
and pamphlets,

22:15.334 --> 22:18.462
go to all them movies, hear testimonials
of people talking about this and that,

22:18.545 --> 22:22.716
but it still turns out to be just the mama
and the baby doing all the work.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.134
You're still a big part
of it though, right?

22:24.217 --> 22:26.970
-I mean, you're the coach.
-Coach.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.515
Yeah, but on the day of the big game,

22:31.308 --> 22:33.560
it's the players gotta go out
and kick butt.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.814
Us coaches, we just sort
of walk the sidelines of life.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.609
You'll do fine.

22:42.152 --> 22:42.986
Yeah.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.448
You know, Bobby,
I don't know if you're aware of this,

22:46.531 --> 22:49.743
but there is a certain point
during the birthing process,

22:49.826 --> 22:52.120
when it becomes incredibly messy.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.081
-Ooh.
-(car horn beeps)

22:54.164 --> 22:55.415
(car approaching)

23:01.630 --> 23:03.382
-All right, I got the warrant. Let's go.
-(car door closes)

23:03.924 --> 23:05.258
-(door slams)
-Hold it right there!

23:05.342 --> 23:06.927
-ROLAND: What the hell you doing in here?
-LUCY: Roland Maxwell,

23:07.010 --> 23:08.929
we have a warrant for your arrest.
Attempted murder.

23:09.012 --> 23:10.097
We have a warrant
to search your apartment.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.681
-Hey, pal, cut it out!
-Mirandize him.

23:11.765 --> 23:12.724
HARRY: Hey, what's in here?

23:12.808 --> 23:16.269
-You have the right to remain silent...
-Hey, Maxwell!

23:16.353 --> 23:18.271
Hey, pal, get your hands behind your head.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.111
RENKO: Thought you might wanna
have a game of stickball,

23:24.194 --> 23:25.904
use my bat against your head, pal.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.739
ROLAND: You're wasting your time.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.658
(rattling)

23:29.741 --> 23:31.743
(Renko talking, indistinct)

23:34.496 --> 23:35.497
Patsy?

23:37.541 --> 23:39.626
-BOBBY: We got him?
-We got him.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.629
Ten bucks says this did the old man.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.923
Bobby, we're gonna need forensics.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.260
Harry this looks like a connecting door.

23:48.969 --> 23:49.928
So what?

23:50.762 --> 23:52.639
So it's kinda empty in here, isn't it?

23:53.807 --> 23:55.976
This looks like it may be
a different apartment.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.313
Hey, Maxwell,
this is your apartment, isn't it?

24:04.192 --> 24:05.444
-Is this your apartment?
-I want to see my lawyer.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.778
-Is this your apartment?
-I want to see my lawyer.

24:06.862 --> 24:07.988
He wants to see his lawyer.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.657
You know what I'm seeing?

24:11.491 --> 24:13.326
He may just have access.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.454
-Maybe it's another--
-(door opens)

24:15.537 --> 24:17.831
Five-fourteen. Warrant specify
the apartment number?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.668
Five-fifteen. Damn it.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.504
We could lose the gun on this.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.175
Not if, right now, I pick up the gun
and kick it into 515.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.136
That's brilliant, Harry.
Perjury, plus he saw us.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.888
Mr. Legal Beagle.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.726
(door closes)

24:40.061 --> 24:41.855
(water running)

24:41.938 --> 24:42.981
(door opens)

24:45.275 --> 24:46.109
(door closes)

24:46.902 --> 24:48.570
We had a misunderstanding earlier.

24:49.362 --> 24:50.197
What's that?

24:50.405 --> 24:53.116
The article in the paper.
I thought you meant me and Joyce.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.160
Oh, no.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.120
Petition on Celestine.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.833
I signed it Henry Goldblume, Frank.
I didn't put lieutenant down.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.293
Who did?

25:03.376 --> 25:04.211
They signed me up.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.296
Obviously,
I didn't expect them to exploit it.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.173
I'd say that was pretty naive of you.

25:10.091 --> 25:11.426
(rustles)

25:12.135 --> 25:13.720
You getting heat from downtown?

25:13.803 --> 25:14.888
Not yet, but I will.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.474
You'll get a reprimand
and that's appropriate.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.352
-Why?
-Because it's out of policy, Henry.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.395
Because it makes it look as if the cops

25:22.479 --> 25:25.190
who didn't sign the petition
are in favor of capital punishment.

25:25.273 --> 25:28.026
Nobody's persuaded me the death penalty's
any kind of civilized innovation,

25:28.109 --> 25:31.404
but I don't figure my badge is there
to prop up personal opinions.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.615
Or to make political statements.

25:33.698 --> 25:34.866
It's not a muzzle, either.

25:34.950 --> 25:35.867
It's not a muzzle.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.953
And it's not a megaphone.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.832
(door opens, closes)

25:43.542 --> 25:45.669
Right. Great.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.796
Captain, just got ballistics
on Maxwell's gun.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.173
It's a definite match with the bullet
that shot James Parsons.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.967
-Can't use it.
-What if we can prove we'd have

25:52.050 --> 25:54.094
-found the gun anyway without a warrant?
-How?

25:55.345 --> 25:57.013
I mean, good. Go ahead and try.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.059
FRANK: Where do we stand
without the weapon?

26:01.142 --> 26:02.978
We got the goods
that Maxwell sold to Washington.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.980
SID's over at Maxwell's apartment.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.648
They're going through
everything looking for fibers

26:06.731 --> 26:09.359
Testing for gunshot residue
off Maxwell's hand.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.486
Time that's elapsed,
I don't like our chances.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.905
-What's the husband's condition?
-Critical, still unconscious.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.575
All right let's ride herd on SID.
Get a hold of Irwin Bernstein.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.243
Make application for voice ID.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.327
All right, I got it.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.039
Uh, excuse me, Captain.
Reporter asked for you.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.208
Says you called him. Stu Henley?

26:25.292 --> 26:27.085
Would you ask him to wait
in line-up, please?

26:27.168 --> 26:28.003
Yes, sir.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.006
I'm really sorry about this.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.591
It's all right. Just file it under...

26:34.092 --> 26:35.468
"It's not a perfect world."

26:35.802 --> 26:37.012
This guy should go away.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.722
We may get him there yet.

26:39.973 --> 26:40.807
Excuse me.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.897
Look, Mercy called.
Parsons lousy, but he's conscious.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.566
Let's get a photo array over there.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.776
FRANK: If you didn't talk to her directly,
where did you get the idea

26:51.860 --> 26:54.946
that our separation
had anything to do with this case?

26:55.030 --> 26:57.657
Captain, forgive me,
I didn't suggest any direct connection.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.451
It was purely a statement of fact,

26:59.534 --> 27:01.453
about two people who stood
on opposite sides.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.163
It's purely none of your damn business.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.874
Are you saying that a cop
whose wife's in an adversarial position

27:05.957 --> 27:07.792
doesn't have to cope
with a hell of a lot of problems

27:07.876 --> 27:09.169
other cops don't have?

27:09.252 --> 27:11.588
No, Mr. Hanley, I'm not saying that.
What I'm saying...

27:11.921 --> 27:14.132
What I'm asking is that my personal life

27:14.215 --> 27:16.426
not be speculated on by you
or anybody else

27:16.509 --> 27:18.053
for the purpose of selling newspapers.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.764
All due respect, Captain,
if I use that as a criterion

27:20.847 --> 27:23.391
every time I sit down to write a story,
I can't do my job.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.351
What criterion?

27:24.434 --> 27:27.187
Whether what I write is gonna impinge on
somebody's personal life.

27:27.270 --> 27:31.650
Captain, my apology for any contextual
inaccuracies in the story,

27:31.733 --> 27:34.194
but I really think you've overreacted.

27:34.861 --> 27:35.862
Excuse me.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.416
(indistinct chatter on P.A.)

27:49.584 --> 27:51.419
-(door squeaks)
-Mrs. Parsons?

27:52.295 --> 27:53.588
(crying) He's gone.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.050
James is gone.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.259
I'm so sorry.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.346
(sobs) It's better.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.474
(stutters) He would've been crippled.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.102
James could not live like that.

28:08.103 --> 28:12.232
So... really, it's better.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.985
(sobs) Don't you... think so?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.615
(sobbing) Oh, God.

28:22.867 --> 28:26.329
(police siren wailing)

28:26.413 --> 28:29.374
Listen, baby. Show that little man
what a wuss he is.

28:29.457 --> 28:31.543
-You jump it.
-Yeah, look at your wife jump.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.712
Around your legs. Jump it over the rope.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.423
-Come on, like that. Jump it!
-(police siren wailing)

28:36.506 --> 28:38.883
-(clamoring)
-(siren stops)

28:42.178 --> 28:43.930
(indistinct radio chatter)

28:45.890 --> 28:46.891
You folks all right?

28:47.559 --> 28:51.730
They took our car. They took our luggage.
They took all of our money.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.982
-Those kids?
-No, other ones.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.277
-They took everything.
-We were looking for the Civic Center.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.571
We got off on the wrong interstate exit.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.030
We stopped to ask directions.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.491
They just pushed us
out of the car and drove away.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.828
Well, why don't we just get in the car
and get out of here.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.415
-What kind of car was it?
-Uh, she was a rental.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.625
I really can't remember
the license number.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.586
It, uh, it was metallic blue.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.087
It was gray.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.630
It was gray.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.299
We're from out of town.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.718
-We figured that.
-(car door slams)

29:21.801 --> 29:24.053
-Never, never again.
-LUCY: Dispatch.

29:24.137 --> 29:27.182
Never again will I take
a policeman for granted, I'm telling you.

29:27.265 --> 29:31.269
-WOMAN: Amen, amen to that.
-...or gray late-model sedan. You copy?

29:31.728 --> 29:33.730
I, uh... I'm Dave Fimpel.

29:33.813 --> 29:35.732
-And this is my wife, Sarah.
-SARAH: How are you?

29:36.357 --> 29:40.487
You know, the criminal elements up here
really are carnivorous on folks like you.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.448
She means you look a little out of your
natural habitat, so to speak.

29:43.531 --> 29:46.075
Oh, yeah. We're from Rochester, New York.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.621
We're on our way back home
from the in-laws in Phoenix.

29:49.704 --> 29:50.830
-Dave?
-Yeah?

29:50.914 --> 29:53.500
What are we gonna do?
We don't have any money.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.169
Well, don't worry about it sweetheart.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.838
I'll call Dennis, he'll wire us
some first thing good morning.

29:58.922 --> 30:02.425
And in the meantime? All we've got
is the clothes on our backs.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.885
That's no problem, ma'am.

30:03.968 --> 30:06.846
We have a victim's aid program.
They'll put you up for the night

30:06.930 --> 30:07.764
and give you meal money.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.182
DISPATCH:<i> Unit 2203,</i>

-Unit 2203, responding.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.650
LUCY: Look at that, somebody
stole an ice cream truck.

30:18.733 --> 30:22.153
-(police sirens wailing)
-Hang on, folks.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.156
(police siren wailing continues)

30:33.957 --> 30:35.625
(tires screeching)

30:40.421 --> 30:42.799
-You all right?
-Oh, sure. Fine. No problem.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.802
-Just fine. Just fine.
-(truck jingle playing)

30:45.885 --> 30:47.262
-BOBBY: Get out of the truck!
-Stay down!

30:47.345 --> 30:48.930
RENKO: Hands above your head,
don't look back at me!

30:49.013 --> 30:51.057
BOBBY: We said get out of the truck, now!

30:51.140 --> 30:52.267
Don't look back!

30:52.350 --> 30:53.518
-(gun clicks)
-Hey, get out.

30:54.102 --> 30:57.021
-What seems to be the trouble, officers?
-RENKO: It's the nutball with the ice.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.982
Listen, this is a mistake.
We can talk about it later.

30:59.065 --> 31:00.942
-Up on the car.
-Ow! Ow!

31:01.025 --> 31:03.862
This is a stolen truck,
and you're under arrest for the suspicion.

31:03.945 --> 31:07.198
Bobby, why don't we have ourselves a
nice... Popsicle.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.868
-Uh, yeah, make mine--
-Stop!

31:09.951 --> 31:11.911
-Stop!
-(all yelling)

31:11.995 --> 31:15.164
Hey, listen, jerko, you try that again
and your ice is gonna melt fast!

31:15.248 --> 31:17.041
-You got that?
-It's not enough, is it?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.960
No, the power's gonna go out,
the ice is gonna melt

31:19.043 --> 31:21.254
and Mother hasn't had enough
excitement for one day.

31:21.337 --> 31:22.922
-Is that the idea?
-What's he talking about?

31:23.006 --> 31:24.632
He's nuts. Put him in their unit.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.759
Please, please, please, no!
You want a criminal?

31:26.843 --> 31:29.053
You want a criminal?
Sydney Marsh, landlord.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.308
He's a criminal.
Failing to pay the electric! (laughs)

31:33.391 --> 31:37.020
You think this was an accident?
He never liked my mother. Never.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.605
Never was civil to her, not in ten years.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.398
-What flavor do you want?
-No, please!

31:40.481 --> 31:43.693
-You don't understand, if she thaws out--
-Open it up, Ray.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.783
-(whimpers)
-Anybody wanna split a mom-sicle?

31:50.867 --> 31:52.493
Oh, my God.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.663
-(pager beeping)
-Carol Anne.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.789
Bobby, it's Carol Anne.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.042
All right, you take care of her.
I'll catch a ride with Coffey.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.210
-(grunts)
-Get your hands up there.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.466
-(man grunts)
-(car starts)

32:06.549 --> 32:09.761
-(siren wailing)
-(tires screeching)

32:09.844 --> 32:11.930
Hey, how goes the third world rat race?

32:12.597 --> 32:13.890
I don't know, Howard.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.517
What do you say to a woman
whose husband's murdered

32:16.601 --> 32:18.519
after 40 years of marriage?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.066
MAN: I know she's dead,
do you think I'm crazy?

32:23.149 --> 32:25.443
The key to cryogenics
is freezing the physical body

32:25.526 --> 32:27.153
until the cure is found
for the cause of death.

32:27.236 --> 32:28.404
She had a crushed skull.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.449
Of course, you idiot.
That's because I hit her with a skillet.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.159
(door opens)

32:37.080 --> 32:38.289
They give you Miranda, Roland?

32:38.373 --> 32:39.832
I'm waiting for my lawyer.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.042
You'll get your lawyer.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.919
They get backed up.
Usually takes about an hour.

32:43.002 --> 32:44.170
So fade away.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.047
Oh, you don't understand
about Miranda, Roland.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.715
Miranda just means you
don't have to talk to me,

32:47.799 --> 32:50.551
-doesn't mean I can't talk to you.
-You can't ask me questions.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.680
FRANK: Who's asking questions?
I'm just discussing current events here.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.556
Like, for instance, uh...

32:56.140 --> 32:58.226
did you know that James Parsons died?

32:58.309 --> 32:59.769
Have you seen this headline?

32:59.852 --> 33:01.562
"Nun Slayer Dies Tomorrow."

33:03.982 --> 33:07.735
"Tomorrow Celestine Gray,
22-year old high school dropout

33:07.819 --> 33:10.446
convicted last summer of the rape
and murder of a Roman Catholic nun,

33:10.530 --> 33:14.242
will be the fourth execution in the state
since August 1983.

33:15.076 --> 33:18.204
There are now 25 men and one woman
on Death Row in the state,

33:18.287 --> 33:20.164
all convicted of first degree murder."

33:20.498 --> 33:23.292
-No plea bargain. By choice, I suppose.
-(newspaper rustles)

33:23.376 --> 33:25.712
"Gray has two previous
felony convictions."

33:25.795 --> 33:26.879
That's fewer than you, Roland.

33:26.963 --> 33:29.924
Okay, shut your face!

33:30.008 --> 33:31.676
I'm just discussing current events.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.388
Ever see a man die in the chair, Harry?

33:36.055 --> 33:37.432
-No, sir, I never have.
-It's horrible.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.268
It's like the Dark Ages.
They shave your head...

33:41.477 --> 33:43.688
(sighs) strap you in, all those wires

33:43.771 --> 33:46.858
attached to electrodes,
attached to your legs and your temples.

33:47.650 --> 33:50.903
They say when the first jolt hits,
your muscles bulge.

33:51.821 --> 33:55.283
Hairs in your arms get singed,
this terrible acrid smell.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.869
They say you don't feel it for very long.
I don't know, though.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.037
(bangs table)

33:59.537 --> 34:01.664
You murdered him Roland,
and we can prove it, easy.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.041
How is that?

34:03.833 --> 34:04.876
With forensics.

34:06.502 --> 34:07.670
And the stolen medal.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.132
And your description and the clothes
we found in your apartment.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.009
And when Mrs. Parsons hears your voice.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.886
Then why are you driving me then?

34:14.969 --> 34:17.305
Because the honest-to-God
truth here is, Roland,

34:17.388 --> 34:19.140
that I'm against capital punishment.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.101
You have an hour in which to confess
or there'll be no pleas.

34:22.185 --> 34:25.354
then you're gonna die by electrocution,
strapped in, just like Celestine Gray.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.439
-(knocks)
-(door opens)

34:30.026 --> 34:32.862
-Talk to my client?
-Sure, he's been great company.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.281
But you'd better get him a bag
to breathe into.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.076
(footsteps walk away)

34:38.993 --> 34:40.119
DAVE: Yeah, I understand.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.371
I'm sure that's the best
we can do, isn't it?

34:42.872 --> 34:44.957
Okay, thanks. Yeah, bye-bye.

34:46.084 --> 34:49.253
Well, Dennis says hi.
The banks just closed.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.172
But he's gonna wire us some money
at the telegraph office

34:51.255 --> 34:52.465
first thing in the morning.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.884
Excellent. Things are looking up already.

34:54.967 --> 34:57.970
Now, we have one little problem.
No biggie.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.973
It's just that the optics
convention's in town,

35:01.057 --> 35:03.601
and, well, I'm sure we can find some place
with a vacancy.

35:04.018 --> 35:06.395
Ms. Furillo?
See that guy sitting over there?

35:07.355 --> 35:10.024
He had his mother frozen
in an ice cream truck.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.026
She was dead as a mackerel.

35:13.361 --> 35:16.405
-(knocks on door)
-Captain, uh, can you spare a minute?

35:16.489 --> 35:19.242
Sure come on in, Stan. Sit down.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.036
How's it going?

35:22.411 --> 35:24.705
Good. Busy.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.874
It's all a lot to like.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.584
A few things I'd like to change.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.169
Just make the squad room yours.

35:30.419 --> 35:32.463
I appreciate that
vote of confidence, Captain.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.424
Which makes this morning's

35:35.967 --> 35:38.052
little situation
all the more embarrassing.

35:39.011 --> 35:40.721
So I'm just gonna say this once.

35:41.013 --> 35:43.766
What happened this morning,
which, thank God for small favors,

35:43.850 --> 35:47.603
you weren't here to see, is one of the
all-time embarrassments of my life.

35:47.895 --> 35:51.607
I don't believe in bringing
the personal life into the squad room.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.860
And I'll tell you the truth Captain,

35:53.943 --> 35:56.237
I'm 54 years old,
I got a personal life that would

35:56.320 --> 35:57.905
bore the crap out of a turtle.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.117
I guarantee you, it won't happen again.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.203
That's good Stan,
because to tell you the truth,

36:04.287 --> 36:06.080
I think we have enough
action up here as it is.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.250
Imagine, sir.

36:09.709 --> 36:13.004
Imagine a woman wanting
to take it outside like that.

36:13.087 --> 36:16.632
I'm not proud of it, but God help me,
I think it's finally quits between us.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.219
Good. That's good, Stan.

36:20.595 --> 36:25.016
You know, it's a tragedy when an otherwise
normal person, in this case,

36:25.099 --> 36:27.852
this Vera who, believe me I don't even
like to credit by using her name,

36:27.935 --> 36:30.771
when they can't control
the simplest human emotion.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.065
The day my wife died, my Helen--

36:33.566 --> 36:34.859
God rest her beloved soul.

36:34.942 --> 36:37.612
I controlled myself
better than this person.

36:38.571 --> 36:41.574
Not to mention the day
I cut off Blackie's leg,

36:41.657 --> 36:43.784
and believe me, that was
no tea party, neither.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.455
Ah, anyway, rest assured, Captain,
you got nothing to worry about.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.916
This squad room's gonna tick along,
just like a watch.

36:49.999 --> 36:50.958
Good night, sir.

36:52.084 --> 36:55.421
Uh, Stan, uh... ten more seconds, please.

36:55.504 --> 36:56.339
Yes, sir.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.841
You said something about Blackie.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.426
Yes, sir. My dog.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.929
Did I correctly understand
you to say that you...

37:07.016 --> 37:07.892
cut off his leg?

37:10.061 --> 37:11.729
Freak accident, sir.

37:12.438 --> 37:14.982
See, I was trimming
the hedge in the backyard.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.567
And the phone rings.

37:17.109 --> 37:19.237
And I turn away for the two seconds.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.950
Blackie happens to lean in.

37:24.492 --> 37:27.119
And he lifts his leg to do his business.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.246
(snaps fingers)

37:30.498 --> 37:32.166
Thank God it was a clean cut, sir.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.502
Gee, I'm sorry.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.048
Couple of years of pooches hopping around
like it's nothing.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.091
Imagine, sir.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.717
The second it happened,

37:41.801 --> 37:44.053
he looks up at me
with those big, brown eyes,

37:44.136 --> 37:45.680
and he forgives me.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.598
-Man's best friend.
-That's right.

37:48.015 --> 37:51.185
I cut off his leg,
he tells me he loves me.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.647
-Then this mutt of a broad--
-(knock on door)

37:55.982 --> 37:57.108
Pardon my French, ma'am.

38:04.824 --> 38:08.327
Roland Maxwell is in the process
of giving a full statement.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.287
Really?

38:10.162 --> 38:12.957
After a fairly fancy
interrogation, I take it.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.751
No need for flattery, counselor.
Just ordinary cleverness.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.296
-At the expense of my assistant.
-Come on, Joyce.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.006
Spare me the beautiful defender

38:20.089 --> 38:22.091
telling the police captain
he's way out of line.

38:22.174 --> 38:24.135
It's old, been playing so long
I know it by heart.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.762
Nice. The cop speaketh.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.055
That's what I am.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.308
You know you coerced that confession.

38:30.725 --> 38:31.559
You could lose it.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.020
I'll take my chances.

38:44.196 --> 38:47.074
Whoa, hold up there.
You the gentlemen in room 306?

38:47.158 --> 38:49.577
-Who's asking?
-Nat Rikers, I manage the dump.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.246
I don't know, it ain't so bad.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.415
Yeah, I've been in worse.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.627
Yeah, listen, um, mind
if I ask you a question?

38:59.045 --> 38:59.920
NEAL: Not at all.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.256
(elevator starts)

39:02.340 --> 39:04.759
So, you guys doing a little
business on the premises, huh?

39:04.842 --> 39:06.218
Like what?

39:07.345 --> 39:08.554
(elevator stops)

39:08.637 --> 39:10.264
Come on, come on,
you're doing stolen goods.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.641
-Word has it you got a serious bankroll.
-So?

39:12.725 --> 39:14.435
Well, I'm only saying this
because I hear things once in a while,

39:14.518 --> 39:16.437
which could be of mutually
beneficial interest.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.481
What kind of things, Mr. Rikers?

39:18.564 --> 39:19.815
Depending on your level of interest,

39:19.899 --> 39:21.400
certain things
which I don't know if you're into.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.194
I don't know the scale of your operation.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.321
We don't have to mince words, Rikers.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.615
You're talking smack? Soda? What?

39:27.782 --> 39:30.451
'Cause if you got a buck to turn here,
we can mobilize.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.161
-Yeah?
-Speak.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.914
I got some friends,
had an arrangement and the buyer fell out.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.083
They got four keys Bolivian pink.

39:38.793 --> 39:39.710
What do they need?

39:39.794 --> 39:41.128
Hundred, hundred and a quarter.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.213
Pocket change.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.215
Your people anxious to move,
we'll do it tomorrow.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.175
-You make the introductions?
-I'll do that.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.388
-(elevator starts)
-What's your action, chief?

39:50.471 --> 39:51.889
Standard ten percent.

39:51.972 --> 39:53.724
-Out of their end.
-Yeah.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.435
(elevator clangs)

39:58.229 --> 40:00.689
This is good. Mike, 306.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.275
Make sure these guys get
plenty of clean towels and stuff.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.944
-More ashtrays.
-(coughing)

40:07.029 --> 40:08.489
Hey. Hey, baby.

40:08.572 --> 40:12.076
I said you got yourself a boy, not a girl.

40:12.159 --> 40:14.495
Can't you tell the difference, honey? Hmm?

40:15.121 --> 40:16.872
-Huh?
-Honey. Shut your face.

40:16.956 --> 40:17.790
Do you understand?

40:17.873 --> 40:20.167
Just so you know
what you're getting into, sugar.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.253
-See?
-You like that?

40:22.503 --> 40:25.297
-Did you like that? You little nothing!
-(screaming)

40:25.381 --> 40:28.175
You little nothing!
I ought to cut your throat!

40:28.259 --> 40:31.679
-You know that?
-Get him off! (gasping)

40:32.304 --> 40:35.266
Get up! Up, up, up on your feet!

40:35.349 --> 40:36.809
Okay!

40:38.352 --> 40:41.063
Which one of these two individuals
are you in love with?

40:42.606 --> 40:44.150
MAN: Thanks for nothin'!

40:46.444 --> 40:48.028
(phone ringing)

40:49.530 --> 40:51.657
Well, uh, here we are.

40:52.741 --> 40:53.576
Oh.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.453
This is nice.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.413
It's very nice.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.585
-Frank?
-Oh, Ray, did you get the buy money

41:02.668 --> 41:04.462
-for LaRue and Washington?
-Yes.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.839
I want to go out on that operation.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.426
-On LaRue's and Washington's?
-They need a South American money man.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.137
LaRue and Washington need me.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.054
Please, Frank.

41:15.347 --> 41:16.724
All right, check with Henry
on assignments.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.726
We'll see if you fit
the profile in the morning.

41:18.809 --> 41:19.643
Good.

41:22.938 --> 41:24.064
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.151
I hear Roland Maxwell confessed.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.028
Someone scared him.

41:29.945 --> 41:32.448
Eight guys out of ten
would've laughed in my face.

41:32.531 --> 41:34.783
Maybe. Anyway, thanks.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.411
I felt really bad about
screwing up the warrant.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.748
-You didn't screw up the warrant.
-My mind tells me that.

41:41.707 --> 41:45.127
My heart says,
"Patsy, if that guy had walked..."

41:45.211 --> 41:46.212
You'll what, quit?

41:48.297 --> 41:49.131
Definitely.

41:49.590 --> 41:51.383
I've been watching you for six weeks.

41:52.510 --> 41:57.431
Case by case, I'd say you're somewhere
between good and great. Okay?

41:58.140 --> 41:59.934
Been watching you for six weeks, too.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.646
Oh, that sounds real bad. Um...

42:04.063 --> 42:05.272
Okay, let me start over.

42:06.232 --> 42:09.360
Uh, Captain, the other day
when you helped me get my car started...

42:09.443 --> 42:11.028
Did you ever get jumper cables?

42:11.111 --> 42:12.863
-Not yet.
-Get jumper cables.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.408
I mean, I'm telling you, really.
I mean, that or a new battery.

42:16.992 --> 42:18.285
Promise, I will.

42:19.995 --> 42:22.248
Um, what I was coming to was, um...

42:22.748 --> 42:24.833
I know it's against
all the unwritten rules,

42:24.917 --> 42:28.712
it's certainly against male
personal code 376-B,

42:29.505 --> 42:31.924
but, um, you were so nice,

42:32.508 --> 42:35.636
and it seemed like that wasn't exactly
in a business context.

42:36.178 --> 42:37.179
And so, um...

42:38.847 --> 42:40.766
Would you like to have dinner
with me sometime?

42:41.725 --> 42:42.560
Yes.

42:44.061 --> 42:46.855
-(chattering)
-MAN: I don't believe it.

42:46.939 --> 42:50.192
All right, I got an announcement!
I got a general announcement.

42:50.526 --> 42:53.279
Announcing the arrival of Laura Ann Renko,

42:53.362 --> 42:57.116
-seven pounds, four ounces!
-(cheering, applause)

42:57.825 --> 43:00.828
She had a slightly misshapen melon
on first appearance,

43:00.911 --> 43:05.457
but she is happy and healthy
and oh, so beautiful, just like her mama.

43:05.541 --> 43:09.962
And I fell on my face and sustained
a slight fracture to my proboscis.

43:10.045 --> 43:14.049
-Looks like you busted your honker, too.
-(laughter)

43:19.847 --> 43:21.724
I broke up with a guy in July.

43:22.224 --> 43:23.934
We were living together three years.

43:24.893 --> 43:25.728
Rough one?

43:26.770 --> 43:28.314
Yeah, pretty much.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.275
I really don't know
what happens between two people.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.487
Joyce said once loving
each other is no guarantee

43:35.571 --> 43:37.239
that you're gonna make each other happy.

43:37.948 --> 43:40.034
-She's right, you know.
-Thank you.

43:42.703 --> 43:45.539
I think part of it's that I wanted
the marriage more than she did.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.708
Pushed a little. Probably she resented it.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.918
-Felt I was holding her down.
-Were you?

43:50.294 --> 43:52.296
I don't know, I think she thinks I was.

43:53.797 --> 43:54.757
You lonely?

43:59.386 --> 44:00.679
It's been four months.

44:01.889 --> 44:04.099
Think I've made a lot
of mistakes here already,

44:05.225 --> 44:09.104
but I look at you and I see a man
that's too hard on himself.

44:10.606 --> 44:12.608
On one shoulder is this good angel.

44:13.442 --> 44:15.277
And on the other is an even better one.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.489
St. Francis of Furillo.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.789
Do you want to give
your angels the night off?

44:29.583 --> 44:30.417
Meaning?

44:31.627 --> 44:32.544
What I mean.

44:35.172 --> 44:36.006
I'm sorry.

44:37.383 --> 44:38.342
No, I'm sorry.

44:39.718 --> 44:41.512
I thought I was better at reading men.

44:41.762 --> 44:42.763
You didn't misread me.

44:43.931 --> 44:44.973
It's just that what I feel

44:45.057 --> 44:47.351
and what I do about my feelings
are two different things.

44:47.851 --> 44:48.894
I'm a married man.

44:50.145 --> 44:51.397
You're separated.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.649
I'm a separated married man.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.860
Who hopes to be back with his wife.

44:57.152 --> 44:59.988
-She must have a lot of power.
-She has.

45:00.823 --> 45:05.369
I used to think that robbed me of my own,
but it doesn't.

45:06.954 --> 45:09.289
Maybe that's what I've learned
in the last four months.

45:12.751 --> 45:14.878
Is this gonna screw up our relationship?

45:16.171 --> 45:17.047
Not for me.

45:18.340 --> 45:19.466
I think you're special.

45:21.009 --> 45:23.345
I think that personally
and I think that professionally.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.516
(train rumbling)

45:48.829 --> 45:49.830
One kiss?

45:51.248 --> 45:52.833
So we both know what we're missing?

46:09.141 --> 46:10.476
(engine revving)

46:11.810 --> 46:14.938
(engine screeches)

46:18.942 --> 46:21.111
JOYCE:
We've got field investigators working.

46:21.987 --> 46:24.865
And we filed last minute
petitions with the US Supreme Court

46:24.948 --> 46:26.366
and the State Supreme Court.

46:27.534 --> 46:29.411
And we have a personal appeal
to the governor.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.538
What about the President?
What could he do?

46:31.622 --> 46:34.374
Nothing. The President's not part of it.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.168
Well maybe you could try him, at least.

46:36.251 --> 46:38.295
Celestine, honestly that's, uh...

46:39.004 --> 46:40.798
He's federal. This is state.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.466
(breathes heavily)

46:42.549 --> 46:44.551
Tamar try that thing with the cops yet?

46:44.635 --> 46:47.429
She did come in. Just like she came to me.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.515
Remember when I filed that whole petition?

46:49.598 --> 46:50.641
Nothing, huh?

46:51.183 --> 46:52.601
A lie's a lie, Celestine.

46:52.684 --> 46:53.602
(sighs)

46:54.853 --> 46:55.896
What about that other?

46:57.189 --> 46:58.273
What I asked you for?

46:59.441 --> 47:01.109
I'm told they give you Valium here.

47:01.193 --> 47:04.029
Yeah, what, ten milligrams?

47:04.112 --> 47:06.990
Ten milligrams I couldn't get my thumb
to sleep without sitting on it.

47:07.324 --> 47:08.158
I'll try.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.410
See you tomorrow, Celestine.

47:11.620 --> 47:12.830
-You just walk home?
-(door closes)

47:13.747 --> 47:14.748
You just walk?

47:14.832 --> 47:16.416
Think I'm gonna sleep?

47:17.835 --> 47:19.628
Think what I gotta do tonight!

47:21.129 --> 47:22.548
They're gonna fry me, lady.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.093
You know what that means?

47:26.176 --> 47:27.845
They're gonna plug me in!

47:29.263 --> 47:30.597
Try to get some sleep.

47:30.681 --> 47:31.723
Why?!

47:34.226 --> 47:36.144
(phone ringing)

47:39.022 --> 47:40.691
-Hello?
-Frank?

47:41.733 --> 47:43.360
I'm sorry, I know it's late.

47:43.443 --> 47:45.404
It's okay. Are you all right?

47:45.696 --> 47:47.197
I'm just leaving Harrisville.

47:47.823 --> 47:50.534
It would take about an hour,
but, uh, could I come over?

47:50.617 --> 47:52.578
Sure. I'd like that.

47:52.661 --> 47:53.537
See you in a bit.

48:03.213 --> 48:06.216
(closing theme playing)
