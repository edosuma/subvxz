WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:05.205
OKAY, THE WEDDING PREP
IS FINALLY DONE.

00:05.205 --> 00:09.142
IN 48 HOURS,
I WILL BE MARRIED TO BRAD.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.211
I HAVE TO SAY,
MRS. WHEELER,

00:11.211 --> 00:12.579
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH BRAD

00:12.579 --> 00:14.314
MAKES ME BELIEVE
IN MIRACLES.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.185
I'M GOING TO IGNORE THAT...

00:18.185 --> 00:22.256
BECAUSE I AM GOING TO WANT
TO BORROW THAT BLOUSE SOMEDAY.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.724
ALL RIGHT,
NOW WHERE'S BEN?

00:23.724 --> 00:25.158
I STILL NEED
TO GO OVER MY VOWS.

00:25.158 --> 00:27.461
ARE YOU REALLY SURE
YOU WANT BEN TO OFFICIATE?

00:27.461 --> 00:28.996
SINCE WE GOT BACK FROM VEGAS,

00:28.996 --> 00:30.497
HE ONLY SPEAKS
IN GRUNTS, SNARLS,

00:30.497 --> 00:33.467
AND SOME PRETTY RUDE
HAND GESTURES.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.002
WE KIND OF GOT IN A FIGHT.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.104
SO MAKE UP.
HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

00:37.104 --> 00:40.674
OH, GOOD. ALL THE LIARS
AND BACKSTABBERS ARE HERE.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.509
SO, BY A SHOW OF HANDS,

00:42.509 --> 00:44.311
WHO KNEW THAT DANNY
WAS IN LOVE WITH RILEY,

00:44.311 --> 00:46.079
THAT RILEY WAS
IN LOVE WITH DANNY,

00:46.079 --> 00:48.215
AND THAT I'VE BEEN MAKING
A COMPLETE FOOL OF MYSELF
FOR THE LAST YEAR?

00:48.215 --> 00:49.683
MOTHER?

00:49.683 --> 00:51.585
PEOPLE TELL ME
LOTS OF STUFF.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.120
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.354
TUCKER?

00:54.354 --> 00:56.156
SEE, WHAT HAD
HAPPENED WAS--

00:56.156 --> 00:59.126
AWESOME!
AWESOME! YEAH!

00:59.126 --> 01:01.094
SO YOU ALL KNEW.
THAT'S GREAT.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.297
OKAY, WHICH MEANS I'M NEVER
SPEAKING TO YOU,

01:03.297 --> 01:06.066
YOU, OR YOU EVER AGAIN.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.734
AND I'M TAKING THIS.
THANK YOU.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.436
BEN.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.972
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD HIM ON A WEEKEND

01:11.972 --> 01:14.041
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ALL ABOUT ME.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.375
YOU'RE SO SELFISH!

01:19.346 --> 01:21.114
-OKAY, BEN, JUST LISTEN--
-SORRY, MOM.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.449
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.284
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
THAT'LL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.486
MM-HMM. HOW ABOUT...
"GET OVER YOUR DAMN SELF"?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.356
FEEL FREE TO TRY
A LITTLE HARDER.

01:29.356 --> 01:32.025
HONEY, IT'S NOT
YOUR BROTHER'S FAULT

01:32.025 --> 01:33.994
THAT YOU AND RILEY
AREN'T TOGETHER.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.763
HE WAS 100% BEHIND
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER

01:36.763 --> 01:38.699
DESPITE THE FACT
THAT HE'S BEEN

01:38.699 --> 01:41.034
IN LOVE WITH THAT GIRL
HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.271
AND NOW THAT RILEY,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

01:44.271 --> 01:46.506
MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE
SOME FEELINGS FOR HIM,

01:46.506 --> 01:48.675
HE SHOULD BE RUNNING
INTO HER ARMS,

01:48.675 --> 01:50.444
BUT HE'S NOT
BECAUSE OF YOU.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.678
BUT HE LIED TO MY--

01:51.678 --> 01:54.548
OKAY, DO NOT CUT YOUR MOM OFF
WHEN SHE'S ON A ROLL.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.284
WE DON'T GET
TO DECIDE WHO RILEY,

01:57.284 --> 01:59.519
OR ANYONE ELSE
FOR THAT MATTER, LOVES.

01:59.519 --> 02:02.356
BECAUSE IF WE COULD,
I WOULD BE MRS. JON BON JOVI,

02:02.356 --> 02:06.259
AND YOU WOULD BE
BENJAMIN BON JOVI BON JOVI!

02:06.259 --> 02:07.628
ANYTHING ELSE?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.696
YEAH. IF YOU SCREW UP
MY WEDDING,

02:09.696 --> 02:12.032
WE WILL BOTH REGRET
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.635
NOW I HOPE THIS HELPED,
AND I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

02:18.171 --> 02:20.173
COME HERE.

02:20.173 --> 02:22.075
(groans)

02:23.243 --> 02:26.213
IF YOU COULD TALK,
YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME, RIGHT?

02:26.213 --> 02:28.115
HIGH FIVE? YEAH?

02:28.115 --> 02:29.683
POUND IT.

02:32.452 --> 02:35.555

02:35.555 --> 02:39.126

02:42.229 --> 02:46.299
OH MY GOD!
THIS IS A DISASTER!

02:46.299 --> 02:50.003
HOW CAN A WEDDING PLANNER QUIT
THE DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.272
YOU REALIZE THAT'S YOUR
FIFTH PIECE OF TOAST, RIGHT?

02:52.272 --> 02:54.174
IT'S CALLED
STRESS EATING, BONNIE,

02:54.174 --> 02:56.610
AND YOU ARE MAKING ME
VERY STRESSED!

02:58.278 --> 02:59.379
WELL, TAKE A BREATHER.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.281
NOBODY WANTS TO MARRY
A CHUNKER, HONEY.

03:01.281 --> 03:04.217
MAYBE IT'S A SIGN.
DO YOU THINK IT'S A SIGN?

03:04.217 --> 03:05.419
YES, I THINK IT'S A SIGN

03:05.419 --> 03:07.154
THAT I CANNOT CONTROL MYSELF
AROUND CARBS.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.256
I BEGGED YOU NOT TO KEEP
BREAD IN THE HOUSE.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.725
-KNOCK, KNOCK.
-WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

03:11.725 --> 03:14.628
I KNOW YOU SAID IT WAS
A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH,

03:14.628 --> 03:16.229
BUT, I MEAN, I FIGURED
YOU'D BE DEAD

03:16.229 --> 03:18.465
BY THE TIME I GOT HERE
ANYWAY, SO...

03:18.465 --> 03:22.169
I MEAN, WHY NOT
STOP FOR COFFEE?

03:22.169 --> 03:23.704
OUR WEDDING PLANNER
JUST QUIT.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.573
ALL OF OUR PLANS JUST
UP IN SMOKE, LITERALLY.

03:26.573 --> 03:30.277
APPARENTLY, SHE WENT CRAZY
AND BURNED HER OFFICES
TO THE GROUND.

03:30.277 --> 03:33.046
OH MY GOD,
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.749
I GOT MY GOOD SUIT
CLEANED FOR NOTHING.

03:35.749 --> 03:39.352
TUCKER, PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO
PRODUCE OUR WEDDING.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.021
I SAW THAT WEDDING SPECIAL
YOU DID LAST WEEK

03:41.021 --> 03:42.355
-ON <i>THE MARY HART SHOW.</i>
-OH MY GOD, YOU DID?

03:42.355 --> 03:45.726
-NO, NOT REALLY.
-(knock on door)

03:50.731 --> 03:52.699
-CHARLOTTE!
-BONNIE!

03:52.699 --> 03:56.236
OH MY GOSH!
GET IN HERE!

03:56.236 --> 03:57.437
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:57.437 --> 03:59.339
OH, MY GOSH,
I CAME RUNNING OVER HERE

03:59.339 --> 04:01.108
THE SECOND I HEARD THAT
THAT WEDDING PLANNER

04:01.108 --> 04:03.443
THAT I RECOMMENDED
LEFT YOU HIGH AND DRY.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.979
I REALLY THOUGHT PRISON
WOULD HAVE CHANGED HER.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.250
WELL, NO WORRIES.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.420
NO, I AM JUST GLAD THAT
YOU ARE HERE TO HELP.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.521
ALL RIGHT, CHARLOTTE.

04:14.521 --> 04:17.057
-YEAH.
-THIS IS MY FIANCE.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.392
WOW. I KNEW YOU
LIKED 'EM YOUNG,

04:19.392 --> 04:24.397
BUT DO YOU HAVE TO PACK
THIS ONE A LUNCH FOR SCHOOL?

04:24.397 --> 04:26.433
NO, NOT THIS ONE.
TUCKER--

04:26.433 --> 04:29.302
THIS ONE.
THIS IS BRAD.

04:29.302 --> 04:34.007
OH, WOW.
HE'S AN UPGRADE.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.009
HELLO.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.244
HI.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.646
SO, BRAD, CHARLOTTE
AND I MET AT THE HOSPITAL

04:39.646 --> 04:41.414
WHEN WE BOTH
WENT INTO LABOR,

04:41.414 --> 04:44.284
AND WE'VE JUST BEEN
BESTIES EVER SINCE.

04:44.284 --> 04:48.021
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE THELMA TO MY LOUISE.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.392
YOU KNOW THEY DIED
DRIVING OFF A CLIFF, RIGHT?

04:52.392 --> 04:57.264
YES, RIGHT AFTER THEY SHOT
A MAN WHO CROSSED THEM.

04:59.199 --> 05:02.002
OKAY, LET'S GET TO WORK!
WE GOT A WEDDING TO PLAN!

05:02.002 --> 05:03.470
YES, WE DO!

05:05.472 --> 05:07.474
OH! HEY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

05:07.474 --> 05:11.111
UH, THIS IS HARD,
SO PLEASE DON'T STOP ME.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.647
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID
I STILL DIDN'T HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU, BUT--

05:13.647 --> 05:15.282
OH, BEN,
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.050
REMEMBER THE PART WHERE
I SAID, "DON'T STOP ME"?

05:17.050 --> 05:18.418
ANYWAY, ABOUT US,

05:18.418 --> 05:21.121
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'VE MOVED ON.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.322
YEAH.
EVERYTHING IS GOOD.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.690
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH DANNY

05:23.690 --> 05:25.158
AND THAT DANNY'S
IN LOVE WITH YOU--

05:25.158 --> 05:27.460
-BEN--
-STILL TALKING.
STILL TALKING.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.396
EVEN THOUGH THIS INFORMATION
WOULD HAVE BEEN

05:29.396 --> 05:31.464
SUPER HELPFUL
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,

05:31.464 --> 05:34.334
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT EVERYTHING IS GOOD.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.636
YEAH, I'M-- I'M GREAT.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.005
WELL, I'M-- I'M GOOD.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.440
ACTUALLY, I'M JUST FINE.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.577
SO IF YOU TWO DON'T
END UP TOGETHER,

05:43.577 --> 05:45.345
THEN THAT'S ALL
TOTALLY ON YOU GUYS,

05:45.345 --> 05:47.380
NOT ME.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.049
NOW YOU MAY SPEAK.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.053
ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.754
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
BEING SO AMAZING.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.223
NEITHER CAN I.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.557
I'M SUPER HAPPY WE'RE
DONE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

05:57.557 --> 06:00.994
I JUST DON'T EVER THINK
THERE WILL BE A DANNY AND ME.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.029
AND WE'RE STILL TALKING
ABOUT THIS. OKAY.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.998
UM, JUST TELL HIM
HOW YOU FEEL.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.032
OKAY, SEE YOU LATER.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.300
NO, I DID, I DID,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.302
AND HE COMPLETELY
FREAKED OUT ON ME,

06:09.302 --> 06:12.339
SO I'M NOT GONNA PUT MYSELF
OUT THERE LIKE THAT AGAIN.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.374
I CAN'T DO IT.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.611
EVERYONE LOSES.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.613
COOL. I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.316
OH, HEY, BEN,
I'M REALLY SORRY, MAN.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.285
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.187
AND YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME,
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN ME AND RILEY.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.989
ONLY BECAUSE YOU BLEW IT,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.690
WHICH APPARENTLY
RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.192
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.627
SHE TOLD ME SHE PUT
HERSELF OUT THERE

06:33.627 --> 06:35.095
AND THAT YOU FREAKED OUT.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.162
ONE TIME.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.564
SHE PUT HERSELF
OUT THERE ONE TIME.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.999
I DID IT, LIKE,
A THOUSAND TIMES,

06:38.999 --> 06:40.367
AND I'M NOT GONNA
DO IT AGAIN.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.369
IF THIS IS GONNA WORK,
SHE HAS TO MAKE THE EFFORT.

06:42.369 --> 06:45.305
YEAH, I'LL BE SURE
TO TELL HER THAT.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.706
-(door closes)
-CRAP.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.476
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TELL HER THAT.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.479
HI! HEY, ME AGAIN.

06:52.479 --> 06:55.081
UM, LOOK, NOT THAT I WANT
TO GET IN THE MIDDLE
OF ANY OF THIS,

06:55.081 --> 06:56.750
BUT I'M JUST SAYING
IF IT WAS ME--

06:56.750 --> 06:59.319
AND WE'VE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
THAT IT ISN'T--

06:59.319 --> 07:01.388
I'D WANT TO KNOW THAT
I WAS SPECIAL TO YOU

07:01.388 --> 07:03.056
BEFORE I MADE A MOVE.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.691
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

07:04.691 --> 07:06.760
I KNOW SO.
SO, ARE WE DONE NOW? COOL.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.129
UH, HOW ABOUT A PICNIC?

07:09.129 --> 07:12.465
UM, MAYBE IN THE TREE HOUSE
WHERE HE CARVED OUR INITIALS.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.535
IT'S ON THE ROOF,
AND I SAVED THE BOARD.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.604
REALLY? YOU KEPT THAT?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.472
THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE DATING?

07:19.472 --> 07:22.409
KIND OF SEEMS LIKE A RED FLAG,
DON'T YOU THINK?

07:22.409 --> 07:24.411
BUT I'M FINE.

07:25.545 --> 07:26.579
I MEAN, THAT'S PERFECT.

07:26.579 --> 07:29.749
SO, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
GET HIM UP THERE IN AN HOUR?

07:29.749 --> 07:33.053
OH, JOY.
I'M PART OF THE PLAN.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.354
OKAY, SURE.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.122
-OKAY.
-SEE YOU.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.560
OH, DANNY,

07:40.560 --> 07:42.529
WOULD YOU MIND RUNNING DOWNTOWN
AND PICKING UP THE TUXES?

07:42.529 --> 07:43.697
OH, I'LL DO THAT!

07:43.697 --> 07:45.398
UH, DANNY'S GOTTA BE
SOMEWHERE VERY IMPORTANT

07:45.398 --> 07:47.300
IN... THREE MINUTES.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.203
OKAY, PEOPLE, WE GOT
A LITTLE PROBLEM.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.538
IS MRS. WHEELER HERE?

07:51.538 --> 07:53.406
PROBLEM?
DID I HEAR PROBLEM?

07:53.406 --> 07:55.108
I THOUGHT
I HEARD HIM SAY "PROBLEM."

07:55.108 --> 07:56.977
OKAY, OKAY, LET'S JUST
TRY TO STAY CALM.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.445
THERE'S NO REASON
TO FREAK OUT.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.047
JUST A COUPLE OF TEENY TINY
LITTLE BLIPS.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.515
THE VENUE CANCELED,
THE CATERER QUIT,

08:02.515 --> 08:04.317
AND THE FLORIST SAID
THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF YOU.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.618
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
A WEDDING.

08:05.618 --> 08:09.356
(crying) NO!

08:09.356 --> 08:12.592
SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA
RIP THAT BAND-AID OFF.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.594
IT'S A STYLE CHOICE.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.129
OH MY GOD!

08:16.129 --> 08:18.164
IT'S ANOTHER SIGN!
OUR WEDDING IS CURSED!

08:18.164 --> 08:20.600
MOM, CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!
WE'LL FIX THIS, I PROMISE.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.435
YEAH, WE TOTALLY
GOT THIS, MOM.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.070
I KNOW! MAYBE WE COULD
HAVE IT AT THE BAR.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.172
DANNY, CALL OUR DISTRIBUTORS
AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE
ENOUGH BOOZE,

08:26.172 --> 08:28.074
AND I'LL GO CHECK TO SEE IF
OUR BANQUET SPACE IS BOOKED.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.176
-WE GOT THIS, MOM.
-OKAY.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.412
WAIT, WEREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO
BE SOMEWHERE IN THREE MINUTES?

08:32.412 --> 08:35.315
-(door shuts)
-IF IT WAS IMPORTANT,
BEN WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.690
TWICE!

08:43.690 --> 08:45.458
AND THIS MAKES TWICE.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.166
(rattles)

08:53.166 --> 08:55.035
OH. PERFECT.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.170
(thunder crashes)

08:57.170 --> 08:58.438
OH, PLEASE DON'T.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.013
OKAY, BAD NEWS.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.382
THE BANQUET ROOM AT OUR BAR
IS BOOKED SOLID.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.685
THE GOOD NEWS? THE BANQUET ROOM
AT OUR BAR IS BOOKED SOLID.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.754
YAY US.

09:14.754 --> 09:17.057
WE GOT IT COVERED,
LITTLE BRO.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.491
I LINED UP
THE FOOD AND DRINKS.

09:18.491 --> 09:21.528
YEP, AND I HAD
THE BRILLIANT IDEA TO
DO IT ON OUR ROOF

09:21.528 --> 09:23.563
WHILE I WAS REMINISCING
ABOUT THAT TIME

09:23.563 --> 09:25.698
THAT I DID IT ON OUR ROOF.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.367
THE ROOF?

09:27.367 --> 09:28.468
OH MY GOD!
RILEY!

09:31.504 --> 09:32.972
RILEY?

09:34.307 --> 09:38.545
THIS... THIS IS WHY
I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT MYSELF
OUT THERE AGAIN!

09:38.545 --> 09:39.746
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.347
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER,

09:41.347 --> 09:45.385
BECAUSE I AM NEVER GETTING
TOGETHER WITH YOU EVER!

09:48.488 --> 09:50.557
DID ANYBODY UNDERSTAND
ANY OF THAT?

09:51.658 --> 09:53.993
I MAY HAVE A THEORY
OR TWO.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.498
BEN, THIS IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.999
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
STAY OUT OF IT?

09:59.999 --> 10:01.201
I CAN'T STAY OUT OF IT.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.635
YOU PUT ME RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

10:02.635 --> 10:05.338
SHE BROKE UP WITH ME
FOR YOU.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.507
YOU WIN, DANNY.
NOT ME, YOU.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.975
I'M THE GIANT LOSER HERE.

10:08.975 --> 10:12.545
YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO SAY
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.148
YOU'RE RIGHT, MAN,
I'M BEING AN IDIOT.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.217
SO YOU'VE REALLY LOVED HER
YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

10:17.217 --> 10:19.252
PRETTY MUCH.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.520
EVERY SINCE SHE
FELL OFF HER BIKE

10:20.520 --> 10:22.555
AND SPRAINED HER ANKLE
WHEN SHE WAS SIX.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.558
I CARRIED HER HOME,
AND SHE CALLED ME HER HERO.

10:25.558 --> 10:29.529
I KNEW RIGHT THEN SHE WAS
THE GIRL I WAS GONNA
MARRY SOMEDAY.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.564
YOU CARRIED HER HOME?

10:31.564 --> 10:35.101
DUDE, GOOD FOR YOU.
SHE WAS HUGE.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.504
OH MY GOD.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.671
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO.

10:38.671 --> 10:41.107
I NEED TO REMIND RILEY
THAT I'M STILL HER HERO.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.543
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
HEY, LET ME KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.979
OR, YOU KNOW, DON'T.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.347
WILL YOU HELP ME?

10:47.347 --> 10:50.683
OH, JOY.
I'M STILL PART OF THE PLAN.

10:50.683 --> 10:53.520
WAS THAT A YES?

10:53.520 --> 10:54.754
(softly)
YES.

10:59.559 --> 11:02.595
(sing-song)
HELLO, CHARLOTTE.

11:03.730 --> 11:07.300
(mockingly)
HELLO, TUCKER.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.669
ARE WE TALKING IN
FUNNY VOICES NOW?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.637
(laughs)

11:10.637 --> 11:13.039
YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE
I KNOW THE REASON

11:13.039 --> 11:14.541
THIS WEDDING IS
FALLING APART.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.643
YEAH, YOU'RE A HORRIBLE
WEDDING PLANNER.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.679
NO.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.314
YOU.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.149
YOU'RE THE REASON.
YEAH.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.584
I MADE SOME CALLS.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.352
AND THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT
TO BLOW UP A WEDDING

11:26.352 --> 11:29.622
AND CANCEL THE CATERER,
THE FLORIST AND THE VENUE,

11:29.622 --> 11:32.692
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HIDE
YOUR SOUTHERN ACCENT.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.361
WHAT SOUTHERN ACCENT?

11:35.361 --> 11:38.097
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO YOUR BEST FRIEND?

11:38.097 --> 11:41.034
BEST FRIEND?
THAT SHAMEFUL HUSSY?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.236
SHE DESTROYED ANY CHANCE
OF ME BEING HAPPY.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.671
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE MRS. WHEELER.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.272
SHE SLEPT WITH MY FIANCE.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.975
OKAY, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE MRS. WHEELER.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.643
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET
REMARRIED LAST YEAR,

11:50.643 --> 11:51.711
BUT SHE PUT
A STOP TO IT.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.746
SHE DIDN'T THINK I KNEW
ABOUT IT, BUT I DID.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.448
AND EVER SINCE THEN,

11:55.448 --> 11:58.551
I'VE BEEN WAITING,
SCHEMING, AND PLOTTING.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.153
WOW.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.287
(chuckles)

12:01.287 --> 12:04.090
DID YOU EVER THINK OF MAYBE
GETTING A HOBBY?

12:04.090 --> 12:06.492
BUT YOU KNOW,
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE,

12:06.492 --> 12:09.429
I CAN SEE HOW MUCH
IN LOVE SHE AND BRAD
REALLY ARE,

12:09.429 --> 12:11.764
I CAN'T GO THROUGH
WITH IT.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.033
HEY, CAN I BORROW
YOUR CELL PHONE?

12:14.033 --> 12:16.569
I NEED TO CALL HER AND
BEG FOR HER FORGIVENESS.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.138
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.007
WOULD YOU ACCEPT
MY APOLOGIES?

12:21.007 --> 12:23.009
-FOR WHAT?
-FOR THIS.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.410
NO!

12:24.410 --> 12:25.612
(car horn honks)

12:25.612 --> 12:26.713
UGGHH!

12:26.713 --> 12:28.181
(rattles)

12:28.181 --> 12:29.249
CHARLOTTE!

12:29.249 --> 12:31.517
(thunder crashes)

12:31.517 --> 12:33.486
OH, PLEASE DON'T.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.520
NO, NO, NO.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.356
NO. NO.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.997
(knock on door)

12:43.997 --> 12:45.632
RILEY, YOU IN THERE?
WE NEED TO TALK.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.400
THE ONLY THING WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT

12:47.400 --> 12:50.603
IS YOU COMING OVER
WITHOUT CALLING FIRST!

12:50.603 --> 12:52.038
THE WHOLE DANNY THING
WAS MY FAULT,

12:52.038 --> 12:54.507
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY FOR THE WEDDING.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.209
HEY, DO YOU SMELL SMOKE?

12:56.209 --> 12:58.711
NO? HUH, MAYBE IT'S ME.
OKAY, SEE YOU LATER.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.747
(smoke alarm blaring)

13:00.747 --> 13:03.383
BEN! BEN, ARE YOU OUT THERE?

13:03.383 --> 13:05.618
OH MY GOD,
IS SOMETHING ON FIRE?

13:05.618 --> 13:06.619
BEN!

13:07.987 --> 13:09.055
DANNY, HEY, IT'S GO TIME.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.123
RILEY NEEDS A HERO
RIGHT NOW.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.058
NOW? I'M ON IT.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.459
-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
-I'VE GOT TO GET READY.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.562
READY? FOR WHAT?

13:16.562 --> 13:18.231
HELP!

13:18.231 --> 13:21.200
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.102
-(rattles)
-(whispers) OH MY GOD.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.348
AAH!

13:38.084 --> 13:40.987
OH, MY GOD. SERIOUSLY?
SUPER DANNY?

13:40.987 --> 13:43.156
I LOST TO A GROWN MAN
IN A COSTUME.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.659
HEY, THIS IS WHAT
I WAS WEARING WHEN
I SAVED HER.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.995
YOU DO HERO YOUR WAY,
I'LL DO IT MINE.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.763
(turns off alarm)

13:50.763 --> 13:54.567
RILEY? IT'S DANNY!
I'M HERE NOW! YOU'RE SAFE!

13:54.567 --> 13:55.635
DANNY?

13:55.635 --> 13:57.670
(screams)

13:57.670 --> 14:00.073
RILEY!

14:00.073 --> 14:01.107
STAND BACK!

14:05.211 --> 14:06.512
LITTLE HELP HERE!

14:06.512 --> 14:09.248
SERIOUSLY, HOW IS SHE
IN LOVE WITH YOU?

14:13.019 --> 14:15.355
(knock on door)

14:15.355 --> 14:16.756
-HEY.
-HEY, I GOT YOUR CALL.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.157
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

14:18.157 --> 14:19.992
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT SEE
BONNIE BEFORE THE WEDDING.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.628
I'M TRYING TO MAINTAIN
A LITTLE BIT OF MYSTERY.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.231
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER SEEN HER
IN WHITE BEFORE.

14:25.231 --> 14:28.067
I SENT HER OFF TO MY HAIR GUY
TO GET ALL BEAUTIFIED,

14:28.067 --> 14:30.103
BUT I DO NEED YOUR HELP.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.170
OKAY.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.739
I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE PUNCH,

14:32.739 --> 14:34.640
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHICH ONE TO SERVE.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.176
THEY'RE BOTH FROM
AN OLD FAMILY RECIPE.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.579
OKAY? HERE.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.449
(coughs)

14:43.449 --> 14:44.751
(exhales)

14:44.751 --> 14:48.054
-(mumbles)
-HUH?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.256
-YEAH?
-WOW. THAT'S-- IT-- THAT--

14:50.256 --> 14:51.657
IT'S A LITTLE STRONG.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.259
I'D PROBABLY GO
WITH THE OTHER ONE.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.728
OH, WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
TRIED IT YET. HERE.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.669
(shivers)

15:05.371 --> 15:07.173
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:07.173 --> 15:10.076
(hoarsely)
I THINK YOUR FAMILY MIGHT
HAVE A DRINKING PROBLEM,

15:10.076 --> 15:12.445
AND I THINK I NEED
TO SIT DOWN.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.446
OH, OKAY.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.181
OH, GOSH.
WOW.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.483
JUST MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE.

15:17.483 --> 15:20.553
WHAT YOU NEED IS
ANOTHER CUP OF PUNCH.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.422
HERE WE GO.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.659
YOU-- YOU KICKED A HOLE
IN MY DOOR?

15:26.659 --> 15:28.294
OH MY GOD!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

15:28.294 --> 15:30.563
I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU
THAT I'M STILL YOUR HERO!

15:30.563 --> 15:33.132
EXCUSE ME FOR TRYING!

15:33.132 --> 15:36.102
THEY GAVE ME A BOOT.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.703
I'M SORRY, A HERO?

15:37.703 --> 15:39.071
A HERO WOULD'VE SAVED ME

15:39.071 --> 15:42.241
FIVE MINUTES BEFORE I LANDED
ON A FIRE ESCAPE...

15:42.241 --> 15:45.244
AND THE NEIGHBOR'S YORKIE.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.113
IT APPARENTLY TAKES HIM
A LITTLE LONGER

15:47.113 --> 15:48.548
TO GET INTO HIS TIGHTS
THAN IT USED TO.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.250
WELL, DON'T WORRY. THIS IS
NEVER HAPPENING AGAIN.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.152
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!
I'M DONE!

15:53.152 --> 15:55.154
YOU'RE DONE?
YOU DON'T GET TO BE DONE,

15:55.154 --> 15:57.990
BECAUSE I ALREADY SAID
THAT I WAS DONE AND...

15:57.990 --> 16:00.359
I'M GONNA SAY IT AGAIN.
I'M DONE.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.030
(door closes)

16:04.030 --> 16:05.531
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU GUYS DO IT.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.067
I HATE HELPING PEOPLE.

16:11.437 --> 16:15.308
(slurring)
IS IT HOT IN HERE
OR IS IT JUST ME?

16:15.308 --> 16:19.111
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT IT IS
PARTIALLY ME, BUT...

16:20.446 --> 16:21.747
YEAH.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.282
I THINK YOU'LL BE
A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE

16:23.282 --> 16:26.185
WHEN WE GET THE REST OF
THESE CLOTHES OFF OF YOU.

16:26.185 --> 16:30.223
-OH MY GOD!
-BONNIE?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.290
LOOK AT ME!

16:31.290 --> 16:34.193
BLUE HAIR!
ON MY WEDDING DAY!

16:34.193 --> 16:36.028
BLUE HAIR!

16:36.028 --> 16:38.097
IT'S A SIGN!

16:38.097 --> 16:40.066
IT'S ANOTHER SIGN THAT
WE SHOULDN'T GET MARRIED!

16:40.066 --> 16:42.268
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

16:42.268 --> 16:45.505
CHARLOTTE! BRAD!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:45.505 --> 16:48.608
OH! OH!
(chuckles)
BONNIE.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.143
WE DIDN'T HEAR YOU
COME IN.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.513
HEY, I LOVE WHAT THEY
DID WITH YOUR HAIR.

16:53.513 --> 16:57.116
OH, HEY, BON-BON. GOOD.
YOU FOUND SOMETHING BLUE.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.621
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

17:01.621 --> 17:04.257
HOW COULD YOU?
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS!

17:04.257 --> 17:05.458
WE WERE FRIENDS,

17:05.458 --> 17:07.560
UNTIL YOU SLEPT WITH
MY FIANCE GERALD!

17:07.560 --> 17:11.063
HA! YOU DIDN'T THINK
I KNEW ABOUT THAT, DID YOU?

17:11.063 --> 17:12.999
WELL, IT'S PAYBACK TIME,
LITTLE MISSY!

17:12.999 --> 17:15.701
YOU WERE GONNA MARRY GERALD?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

17:15.701 --> 17:19.572
I WAS ABOUT TO
ANNOUNCE IT LAST SUMMER
AT OUR BARBECUE,

17:19.572 --> 17:21.474
AND THEN I CAUGHT YOU TWO
IN THE POOL HOUSE

17:21.474 --> 17:24.076
UP ON TOP OF SOME
INFLATABLE RAFTS.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.412
OH MY GOD,
THAT WASN'T ME!

17:26.412 --> 17:30.716
I WAS MAKING OUT WITH
TANYA'S HUSBAND IN THE BUSHES!

17:30.716 --> 17:33.119
EVERYBODY KNOWS JOANIE,

17:33.119 --> 17:35.187
THAT BIG BLONDE TRAMP
FROM DOWN THE BLOCK,

17:35.187 --> 17:36.188
WAS THE ONE
IN THE POOL HOUSE.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.090
OH, REALLY!
EVERYBODY KNEW?

17:38.090 --> 17:40.126
YEAH. I CAME OVER
THE NEXT MORNING

17:40.126 --> 17:41.527
TO HAVE COFFEE
AND TALK ABOUT IT,

17:41.527 --> 17:43.195
BUT YOU WOULDN'T OPEN
THE FRONT DOOR.

17:43.195 --> 17:46.365
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST MAD AT ME BECAUSE
I STOLE YOUR SANGRIA PITCHER.

17:46.365 --> 17:49.268
I WAS MADE AT YOU BECAUSE
YOU SLEPT WITH MY FIANCE!

17:49.268 --> 17:52.004
YOU STOLE
MY SANGRIA PITCHER?

17:52.004 --> 17:54.340
YEAH, BUT NOT YOUR FIANCE.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.243
HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT I WOULD
EVEN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

17:57.243 --> 18:00.313
BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN YOU
FOR 24 YEARS!

18:00.313 --> 18:02.081
YEAH, FAIR ENOUGH.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.382
OH GOD!

18:03.382 --> 18:05.284
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID
ALL THIS FOR NOTHING!

18:05.284 --> 18:08.120
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE TRYING
TO RUIN MY WEDDING

18:08.120 --> 18:09.989
AND TRY TO SLEEP
WITH MY FIANCE?

18:09.989 --> 18:11.290
AND NOW, BECAUSE OF YOU,

18:11.290 --> 18:13.459
I'M ABOUT TO GET MARRIED
ON A DIRTY ROOF

18:13.459 --> 18:16.996
WITH BLUE HAIR
AND A DRUNK GROOM!

18:16.996 --> 18:19.231
DAMN, YOU'RE GOOD.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.735
I LEARNED FROM THE BEST.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.204
THAT'S WHY WE'RE FRIENDS.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.974
WE ARE STILL FRIENDS,
AREN'T WE?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.142
YES. GET OVER HERE,
THELMA.

18:30.142 --> 18:34.313
CHARLOTTE'S EVIL
AND CAN'T BE TRUSTED!

18:34.313 --> 18:36.315
Both:
YEAH, WE GOT IT.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.319
(piano playing)

18:45.625 --> 18:47.627
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME EVERYONE.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.429
"TODAY WE'RE HERE
TO CELEBRATE LOVE.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.531
"SOME LOVE COMES QUICK,

18:52.531 --> 18:54.166
"SOME LOVE DEVELOPS
OVER TIME."

18:54.166 --> 18:56.302
PFFT.
"LOVE."

18:57.670 --> 19:00.473
"A UNION BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO
HAVE TRULY OVERCOME THE ODDS

19:00.473 --> 19:02.274
"TO PROVE THEY WERE MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER."

19:02.274 --> 19:04.677
"MEANT TO BE." HA!

19:04.677 --> 19:06.178
WHY ARE PEOPLE
CHIMING IN?

19:06.178 --> 19:08.114
THERE'S NO CHIMING IN.
STOP CHIMING IN.

19:12.184 --> 19:15.221
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THIS
LOVE STORY THAT'S SO AMAZING.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.523
DESPITE ALL ITS TWISTS
AND TURNS,

19:17.523 --> 19:20.726
IT HAS ENDURED
FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.728
(whispering)
WHO IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

19:25.031 --> 19:27.500
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN BEST FRIENDS
YOUR WHOLE LIVES.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.635
YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH HER WHEN
YOU WERE IN KINDERGARTEN

19:29.635 --> 19:33.272
AND HAVE NEVER STOPPED LOVING
HER, NOT EVEN FOR A DAY.

19:33.272 --> 19:34.674
BEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.275
I'M SORRY, MOM,
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.010
YOU NEED A MINUTE NOW?

19:39.311 --> 19:42.314
YOU TOLD ME YOU ALWAYS KNEW THAT
SOMEDAY YOU'D BE TOGETHER.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.485
I THINK THAT SOMEDAY IS NOW.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.620
MY ONLY QUESTION IS,

19:47.620 --> 19:50.322
DUDE, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

19:57.163 --> 20:00.433
AND THAT'S MY FINAL SIGN.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.967
YOU WANNA DO THIS
ANOTHER TIME?

20:01.967 --> 20:03.602
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

20:03.602 --> 20:06.272
BONNIE, I SWEAR, I HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

20:07.273 --> 20:08.407
OKAY. HA.

20:08.407 --> 20:11.177
SO, DESPITE OUR
TREMENDOUS EFFORTS

20:11.177 --> 20:13.112
AND BACKBREAKING WORK TO PUT
THIS EVENT ON,

20:13.112 --> 20:15.281
IT LOOKS LIKE WE WON'T EVEN
BE HAVING A WEDDING TODAY.

20:15.281 --> 20:17.249
SO, UH--
BUT, YOU KNOW, FEEL FREE

20:17.249 --> 20:19.452
TO JUST GRAB A BAG OF RICE
ON YOUR WAY OUT

20:19.452 --> 20:21.520
AND YOU CAN BOIL
THAT UP LATER.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.023
HEY, WAIT.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.624
MAYBE IT'S NOT
OVER YET.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.129
YOU'RE IN A DRESS,
I'M IN A TUX.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.498
I ALWAYS KNEW WE'D
END UP HERE SOMEDAY.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.134
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, RILEY?

20:38.237 --> 20:40.272
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

20:52.485 --> 20:55.087
(acoustic guitar playing)
