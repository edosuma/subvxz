00:02.711 --> 00:04.576
Relax, Carter.
It's a promotion.

00:04.963 --> 00:07.796
You know, sometimes
it sucks having a dad
who's the town Smokey.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.215
Well, sometimes it sucks
having a daughter
who's the town delinquent.

ALLISON: A haven where the
world’s greatest thinkers
could live and work.

You must be the new sheriff
I've heard so much about.
Nathan Stark.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.191
Do you two have a history?
Not exactly.
He's my husband.

ALLISON: That’s Section Five,

the most advanced scientific
facility in the world.

HENRY: The artifact
is the last remnant

00:39.790 --> 00:42.202
of whatever universe existed
before our own.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.587
You feel that?
Yeah.

00:52.803 --> 00:55.215
Henry, what did you do?
I couldn't let you go.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.631
KIM: None of what we've known
for the past four years
was supposed to happen.

00:58.725 --> 01:03.765
Henry went back
and changed history,
thereby creating a paradox.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.107
We need to stop Henry
from saving Kim.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.522
Someone's gotta go back.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.025

No! No!

01:24.001 --> 01:26.287
I think this is definitely
becoming our thing.

I didn't feel
much like talking.

(DOOR CLOSING)

03:22.828 --> 03:25.740
You know, you can't keep
reliving this, Henry.
It's been over a month.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.575
I know.

03:29.084 --> 03:32.121
I can't bring
Kim back, either.

Well, you could,
but not without unraveling

Sorry.

03:40.762 --> 03:41.968
Look,

03:43.265 --> 03:46.883
you and I are gonna
be living with the memory
of a timeline that's gone.

seem impossible,

03:49.604 --> 03:52.471

gonna happen overnight,

but...

03:54.901 --> 03:58.268
I think that you and I
should help each other
move on.

from the ashes.

04:33.565 --> 04:37.183
The mythical symbol
of death and rebirth.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.566
"Mythical" is right.
The Phoenix is about
as real as Bigfoot.

04:44.284 --> 04:48.197
History and cultures
are chockablock
with stories of the Phoenix.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.701
Its sacrifice to the flames
begins our salvation,

04:53.960 --> 04:57.498
lest we suffer
the flames ourselves.

Another refill, Vincent.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.891
That is my famous

05:20.028 --> 05:22.895
You may wanna go easy.
Try a lobster button.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.897
I've been fighting a cold.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.567
You know, spicy food
cleanses the evil spirits.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.034
The hotter the better.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.411
All right.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.542
Don't say I didn't warn you.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.082
ZOE: So why don't you
just go talk to him?

05:40.882 --> 05:44.374
I can't. You know,
everything is all weird
with us now.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.343
You know, maybe
it was just
a one-time thing.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.051
You know, adrenalin,
heat of the moment.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.181
Making out
with Taggart?

05:52.227 --> 05:54.058
More like a moment
of insanity.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.563
Not so loud.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.228
Look, I really need
some outside
perspective here.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.566
Please?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.571
You want perspective?

06:03.613 --> 06:04.864
Uh-huh.

06:05.657 --> 06:10.697
You hooked up with a guy
whose age difference with you
is the same as me and my dad.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.589
That did it. Thanks.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.209
You're welcome.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.973
You need something, Fargo?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.804
(STAMMERING)
What? No. I mean...

06:40.567 --> 06:42.979
I was just gonna
go get some food.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.310
Uh, do you want anything?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.690
I'm good.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.909
Okay, then.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.860
ALLISON: Nathan!

06:55.206 --> 06:56.582
I didn't expect
to see you here.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.081
Well, I didn't
expect to be here,

06:58.168 --> 07:00.580
but my ears finally
stopped ringing.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.085
I thought I could use
the distraction.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.254
Well, it's good
that you came.
Yeah.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.047
So how are
your burns healing?

07:06.134 --> 07:09.718
Surprisingly well, actually.
My last treatment's tomorrow.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.841
I take it there's no news
from the disciplinary
committee?

07:12.891 --> 07:16.054
It's the Department
of Defense.
Nothing happens quickly.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.977
Well, it was my call
to sample the artifact,

07:19.022 --> 07:21.013
and Kim Anderson died
as a result.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.897
As did the artifact.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.184
Well, someone has to
take the fall.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.646
Nathan, it was an accident.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.399
Let's just wait to see
what the results are

07:28.490 --> 07:31.072
before we jump
to worst-case scenarios.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.153
I'm gonna head back
to the lab.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.327
Take one last look
at the artifact,
just in case.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.491
Look, I don't think you should
necessarily forget
about what happened,

07:40.543 --> 07:43.376
I think it would be wrong,
it would be horrible.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.288
But I do think
that we should look
on the positive side.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.831
Positive?
Yeah.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.878
Like?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.210
Like, um...

07:51.721 --> 07:53.461
The little things.
You know, for
the next four years,

07:53.556 --> 07:55.717
we're gonna know
which movies suck
before they even come out.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.175
We're gonna know
where bad guys
are gonna do bad things

07:58.228 --> 07:59.718
before they even happen.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.055
We're gonna know the outcome
to every major sporting event.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.229
Huge financial upside!

08:04.317 --> 08:07.309
Jack, I don't think
you understand.
That life is gone!

08:07.404 --> 08:11.272
We are not likely
to relive many of
the same events again.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.739
Well, I've had
this picnic before.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.658
Right? As a matter of fact,
tonight is the night

08:15.745 --> 08:17.076
when I ask Allison out
for the first time.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.579
I remember that
because Vincent
was right over there,

08:19.582 --> 08:21.243
making the same
lobster balls.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.744
Buttons.
What?

08:23.420 --> 08:25.411
Oh, whatever. The...

08:26.256 --> 08:28.872
Oh, and see the sweaty
Asian guy here?

08:28.925 --> 08:31.541
He's gonna trip
on that kid's hover thing

08:31.553 --> 08:33.885
and spill his chili
all over that guy's T-shirt.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.429
And I know that,
because tomorrow,
when I go to the dry cleaners

08:36.558 --> 08:38.139
to get my clothes
for the first date
with Allison,

08:38.226 --> 08:42.435
he's gonna be complaining
about how the stains
didn't come out of his...

08:42.564 --> 08:43.599
Whoa!

08:45.442 --> 08:46.431
Yeah.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.808
No, Jack, you have to
take a step back.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.814
Granted, some things
may occur in a similar way,

08:50.905 --> 08:53.066
but they are going to
diverge more and more.

08:53.116 --> 08:56.483
No...
You lived through four years
of a timeline that was erased

08:56.578 --> 08:58.910
because you stopped me
from doing the thing
that created it,

08:58.913 --> 09:00.073
saving Kim.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.163
And the very fact
that we're having
this conversation

09:02.250 --> 09:05.162
means things
are going to change.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.369
Everybody get ready!

09:16.264 --> 09:19.256
The moment has arrived.

09:32.155 --> 09:35.363
There she is. The firebird.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.847
Well, so far everything's
happened exactly the way
it did last time,

10:04.938 --> 10:09.602
including the fact
that I still can't see
Taggart's crazy firebird.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.571
(SIZZLING)

10:25.083 --> 10:26.448
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

10:31.798 --> 10:33.334
Okay, that's new.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.202
So no one saw
what happened?

11:08.251 --> 11:10.367
No. All our eyewitnesses
were staring at the sun.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.916
There's not much tissue left,
but I can run a DNA sample
and get an ID.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.550
No, I know who it is.
It's fat, sweaty Asian guy.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.381
What?
Carter!

11:21.222 --> 11:23.383
I'm being descriptive.
Ifl knew his name I'd use it.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.924
His name is Kwan,
Wayne Kwan.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.555
What? Are you sure?

11:28.897 --> 11:30.558
Yeah, he was on
his third bowl
of five-alarm chili.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.897
Well, fourth if you count
the one he spilled
on Dr. Brock.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.358
You okay?
Yeah. That's Kevin's
occupational therapist.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.904
He's been working
with him for years.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.188
ALLISON: I don't know
how I'm gonna tell Kevin
that he's gone.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.401
What's up?

11:41.534 --> 11:44.025
Um. So what, he get
too close to a barbecue?

11:44.078 --> 11:46.069
None nearby.
Uh. Drop a cigarette?

11:46.122 --> 11:48.363
Mmm-mmm.
Wayne was asthmatic.
He never touched them.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.036
Vincent, do you have
any special ingredients
in that five-alarm chili?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.879
Like what?
I don't know,
alcohol, rocket fuel,

11:56.925 --> 11:59.382
whatever else you cook up
in that chemistry lab
you call a kitchen.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.922
I'll have you know
I come by
my spice naturally.

12:02.013 --> 12:05.380
Without a doubt. But that guy
ate three bowls of your chili
and burst into flames,

12:05.475 --> 12:07.386
so if it's not
too much trouble,
I'd love a sample.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.263
Cool. Help yourself.

12:11.606 --> 12:12.766
Henry, you wanna test it
for me?

12:12.857 --> 12:14.643
It's what I live for.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.565
JO: Well, there is
another possibility.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.272
Yeah, what's that?

12:19.530 --> 12:23.614
Oh, you're not buying
into Taggart's crazy
firebird fairy tales?

12:23.701 --> 12:26.033
You've got to admit
the timing was
a little disturbing.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.694
There are documented
incidents of combustion

12:27.747 --> 12:29.703
when certain chemicals
are exposed to sunlight.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.617
But in this case,
most of them would have been
in his GI tract.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.461
He also spilled a bowl, so...

12:40.468 --> 12:43.881
Fine. Go talk to Taggart.
But don't get your hopes up.

12:44.222 --> 12:47.555
Uh, talk to Taggart?
By myself?

12:48.643 --> 12:51.225
Why, do you have
a problem with that?

12:51.604 --> 12:55.392
No. Uh, you just never
let me follow up on
my own leads, so...

12:55.441 --> 12:58.604
Jo! You've done this
dozens of times
over the years.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.855
What years?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.565
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:02.907 --> 13:07.025
Why, you know...
I mean, "No time like
the present." It's, uh...

13:07.745 --> 13:09.952
I have every
confidence in you.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.283
(CHUCKLES)

13:11.791 --> 13:12.951
Great.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.375
See? We're not
in Kansas anymore.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.345
How's Kevin doing?

13:36.399 --> 13:39.641
Hush. I asked Beverly
to come over and help him
process the news.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.725
Oh.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.070
Kevin, has your mom told you
what happened to Wayne?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.488
He's gone.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.154
BEVERLY: Yeah. Yeah,
I'm afraid he is.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.863
How do you feel
about that?

13:54.375 --> 13:56.616
Will I still see
the other man?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.875
What other man?

14:03.301 --> 14:05.087
The man downstairs.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.588
Do you know
who he's talking about?

14:06.721 --> 14:08.632
No, his sessions
were always one-on-one.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.556
Kevin, can you tell me
the name of the man?

14:16.397 --> 14:17.557
Kevin?

14:18.232 --> 14:19.733
I don't know.

14:21.736 --> 14:22.816
Okay.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.738
BEVERLY:
I don't wanna push him.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.034
It's an awful lot
for him to process
at one time.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.371
He may even be making up
this other man
as a defense mechanism.

14:38.419 --> 14:42.207
Well, thanks for
coming by, Beverly,
we really appreciate it.

14:44.884 --> 14:50.800
And by "we," I mean,
just all of us,
you know, in Eureka.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.720
It takes a village.

14:55.103 --> 14:59.392
Okay. I might be making
a lot of house calls
in this village today.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.475
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.772
Thank you, Beverly.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.692
(PHONE RINGING)

15:05.738 --> 15:06.773
Hey, it's Carter.

15:06.823 --> 15:10.156
I just talked to Taggart,
and he thinks he may know
what happened with Wayne.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.404
All right,
I'll be right there.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.410
I call it
"The Phoenix Effect."

15:21.504 --> 15:26.544
When the firebird appears,
solar flares emit high-energy
exotic meson particles.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.254
Under the right
atmospheric conditions,

15:29.345 --> 15:31.757
you can get
spontaneous combustion.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.892
(STAMMERING)
Is that human?

15:46.279 --> 15:50.522
Of course it is.
Freshly grown skin grafts
from the bio-chem burn unit.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.528
TAGGART: Now watch.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.658
Unidirectional
meson particle emitter.

16:04.172 --> 16:07.005
Turn up the juice, and...

16:12.597 --> 16:15.555
The Phoenix rises.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.010
(EXPLOSION)

16:28.779 --> 16:30.189
I hate you.

16:33.367 --> 16:37.076
You're welcome!
Now, mystery solved.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.997
Except why did it
only happen to
Wayne Kwan?

16:45.838 --> 16:47.669
Eh, interesting point.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.544
I'm gonna go shower.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.550
I'm covered in human.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.514
ZOE: Dad! It's been 20
minutes. I need you to
take me to the concert.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.015
(SHOWER RUNNING)
CARTER: Zoe,
I'll be out in a minute!

17:00.061 --> 17:01.722
SARAH: Allison Blake
is calling, Sheriff.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.056
CARTER: Oh! Great,
put her through!

17:03.147 --> 17:04.762
Oh, yeah, please,
take your time!

17:06.192 --> 17:08.308
Hey, Allison,
can you hear me?

17:08.402 --> 17:10.893
Um, uh, yeah, lcan do
more than hear you.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.946
Oh! Sorry, the...
Yeah. Hey.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.570
"Hey"? Can you put
that away, please?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.405
Oh! Right.

17:18.496 --> 17:21.704
CARTER: Um, SARAH,
no videophone in the bathroom!

17:21.958 --> 17:24.244
Any idea what happened
to Wayne Kwan yet?

17:24.335 --> 17:28.294
Henry's testing the chili,
and Taggart thinks the fire
was caused by an eclipse.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.917
Uh, that's impossible.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.042
Yeah.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.714
He has impressive
visuals, though.

17:32.760 --> 17:37.220
Um, anything more
on the man downstairs
that Kevin was talking about?

17:37.306 --> 17:40.048
ALLISON: No, I checked Global.
Wayne wasn't working
with anyone else.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.059
I don't know, maybe...
Maybe Kevin did make it up.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.470
Huh.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.977
Do you have access to
the GB. phone records?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.102
Yeah, why?

17:49.193 --> 17:50.729
Well, [ﬁgure
if we can ﬁnd out
who he was talking to,

17:50.778 --> 17:52.279
it might tell us something.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.024
All right. Hold on
while I pull it up.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.029
All right. Take your time.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.700
Okay, you know what?
Now you're just mocking me.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.613
All right...

18:06.460 --> 18:08.041
Drive yourself.

18:08.879 --> 18:12.371
Really?
Yeah. But if you're
not home by 11:00,

18:12.466 --> 18:14.548
you will be sleeping
in ajail cell.
ALLISON: Carter.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.217
Oh, I’m not gonna make her
sleep in the jail cell.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.841
She's only 15.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.468
Right.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.675
Which obviously
means that you
don 't have a license.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.559
Yeah, well,
I won't tell
if you don't.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.681
Well, I was testing you.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.642
And I'm disappointed.
You failed.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.854
Carter. There are a bunch
of calls to a chemist,
Rob Matthew.

18:31.902 --> 18:36.362
But he works in Section Five.
Why would he be talking
to Kevin's therapist?

18:43.789 --> 18:45.450
Nice place.

18:45.541 --> 18:49.454
Yeah, Section Five guys
say they don't get the
best houses, but they do.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.788
Well, I live in
an underground bunker

18:50.838 --> 18:53.454
that has more opinions
than my ex-wife.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.545
I'd be thrilled
just to have a window.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.884
Do you smell smoke?

19:09.398 --> 19:10.729
Dr. Matthew?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.691
Is everything okay?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.031
Oh, Carter.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.909
Oh, no.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.078
Dr. Matthew?

19:54.235 --> 19:57.727
I guess that would explain
why he didn't answer
his phone.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.071
Yeah, if Taggart's right
about the Phoenix,
everyone could be in danger.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.744
Oh, it's not
the stupid Phoenix.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.208
After everything we've seen,
how can you say for sure?

20:13.254 --> 20:15.210
Well, because Taggart
said that the
combustion was caused

20:15.256 --> 20:17.588
by meson particles
coming from a solar flare.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.207
I'm no astrophysicist,

20:19.301 --> 20:21.383
but I don't think there
are a lot of solar flares
inside a house.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.880
He's right.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.261
Really?

20:24.974 --> 20:27.090
Could you not act
so surprised?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.057
Think of it
as getting a sunburn.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.718
Sun's rays burn you
from the outside in.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.974
This guy's burned
from the inside out.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.681
Now, this is where
the initial combustion
happened.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.522
Radiating from here,
the frontal lobe.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.190
So their own minds
did this to them?

20:40.239 --> 20:43.356
Yeah, it's like a power surge
in the body's
electrical system.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.608
Think of the brain
as the microprocessor

20:45.703 --> 20:47.785
and the body
as the motherboard.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.864
So then food would
be the energy source.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.370
Great! Have you tested
Vincent's chili yet?

20:53.419 --> 20:56.582
Digesting the beans
in the chili would
release methane,

20:56.714 --> 20:58.454
which is extremely
flammable, except then,

20:58.549 --> 21:02.758
the burning would have
started in the GI tract,
and not in the brain.

21:02.845 --> 21:06.633
So we're back to,
"They just burst into flames
for no apparent reason."

21:06.724 --> 21:10.592
Everything has a reason.
We just haven't
figured it out yet.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.767
Or maybe that's the thing
we should be looking for.

21:15.858 --> 21:16.938
JO: What's the "thing"?

21:16.984 --> 21:19.942
Well, all this time,
we've been assuming
that it was an accident.

21:20.029 --> 21:23.066
What if someone
had a reason to
want them dead?

21:24.158 --> 21:26.114
(BEEPING)

21:27.870 --> 21:29.986
That should do it,
Dr. Stark.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.617
Can't even see the scars.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.874
Yeah, all better.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.078
Time for your monthly
Botox injection?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.712
Hello, Sheriff.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.211
Really?
No comeback?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.550
Just not in the mood.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.799
CARTER: All right.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.384
There was another fire
last night.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.558
This time,
we lost a researcher
named Rob Matthew.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.010
Well, what in
the hell's going on?

21:54.104 --> 21:55.184
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.808
I mean, two guys
burned to death
within eight hours.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.059
I'm guessing it's related.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.609
Were they working on
anything together?

21:59.652 --> 22:01.188
I doubt they even
knew each other.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.944
Wayne was an occupational
therapist in Section One.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.273
Dr. Matthew studied
bio-technology
in Section Five.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.905
All right. Well, we found
a number of inter-office
phone calls between them.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.904
They must have been
talking about something.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.365
I can't imagine
what it would be.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.543
I'm gonna need
a list of names.

22:16.585 --> 22:20.419
Anyone they had contact with,
friends, family, coworkers,
enemies, all of it.

22:20.548 --> 22:21.754
You think someone
did this to them?

22:21.799 --> 22:25.087
When something
seems too coincidental,
it usually is.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.095
Dr. Stark is one of
the finest scientists
Eureka has ever known

22:29.223 --> 22:30.929
and I think that
his past contributions

22:31.058 --> 22:32.969
should be considered
in your review.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.143
Yet the fact remains
that Dr. Stark's decision
to sample the artifact

22:36.188 --> 22:37.928
cost millions of
dollars in damage,

22:38.023 --> 22:40.730
and the life of another of
Eureka '3 ﬁnest scientists.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.725
Eureka is a place where
we push the boundaries

22:42.778 --> 22:44.188
of human understanding
every day,

22:44.238 --> 22:47.696
and it is hypocritical
to punish Dr. Stark
for doing his job.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.908
Are you speaking
as a D. 0.0. liaison
or as his wife?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.530
Ex-wife.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.286
And I believe that
my track record shows

22:54.373 --> 22:58.082
that our personal history
has never interfered with
my professional judgment.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.537
Given the magnitude
of this incident,

22:59.587 --> 23:01.452
I’m afraid the committee
has no choice

23:01.547 --> 23:04.789
but to appoint a new head
of Global Dynamics,
effective immediately.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.930
NATHAN: Why would
anyone wanna kill them
in such a public way?

23:13.017 --> 23:14.097
CARTER: Oh, I don't know.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.556
I guess that's where
this thing called
investigating comes in.

23:17.646 --> 23:18.852
Look, I need to know
who they worked with

23:18.898 --> 23:21.731
and what kind of research
they were doing.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.901
What's wrong?
I'm having trouble
logging in, system error.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.902
Oh. Well, sure
you have access?

23:27.948 --> 23:30.234
There's nothing
in this facility
I don't have access to.

23:30.284 --> 23:33.071
Hey, Allie.
Carter... Um, "Allie"?

23:34.914 --> 23:37.997
Oh, I'mjust trying
something a little
less formal.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.163
I prefer you didn't.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.582
So would I.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.706
Can't get in the database.
Any idea what's wrong?

23:42.755 --> 23:46.088
Yes. The committee
has reached a decision.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.209
And you're the messenger.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.251
I'm sorry, Nathan.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.679
Have they found
my replacement yet?

23:53.766 --> 23:55.506
Actually, they have.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.553
Anyone I know?

23:57.603 --> 23:58.718
Yes.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.554
Me.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.657
CARTER: This isn't right.
NATHAN: I'll say.

24:14.745 --> 24:15.825
Thanks for the vote
ofconﬁdence.

24:15.913 --> 24:16.993
No, I didn't mean that.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.366
I defended you,
Nathan.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.906
Looks like you
defended me right into
a promotion for you.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.582
The only reason
you're not being
redacted

24:22.670 --> 24:25.207
and escorted
to the city limits
is because of me.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.416
So I should be thanking you?
Guys, bigger issues at...

24:27.508 --> 24:28.748
Damn right
you should be.

24:28.842 --> 24:31.094
You were obsessed
with the artifact
and it cost Kim's life.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.260
I mean, what did you expect?

24:33.847 --> 24:37.260
I don't know. Not this.
Good luck, Allison.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.557
Nathan...

24:41.563 --> 24:43.224
So what do we do?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.857
Well, we crosscheck anyone
Wayne Kwan and Rob Matthew
had in common,

24:47.903 --> 24:50.144
to see if they
were targeted.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.820
You okay?

24:52.241 --> 24:54.857
Yeah, let's just...
Let's just find those names.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.070
Sure.

24:58.998 --> 25:04.118
I don't know if this helps,
but I believe things work out
the way they're supposed to.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.832
You just have to have
a little faith.

25:09.258 --> 25:12.591
Yeah, well, I don't have
a lot of faith these days.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.431
(BEEPING)

25:17.766 --> 25:19.927
Go back.
I know that guy!

25:20.644 --> 25:22.430
That's the guy
Wayne spilled his chili
on yesterday!

25:22.563 --> 25:25.976
Yeah, Ryan Brock,
Bio-tech, Section Five.
He worked with Dr. Matthew.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.227
What did
they work on?

25:28.277 --> 25:30.233
The origins
of the artifact.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.732
That thing's been
nothing but trouble.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.737
Yeah, tell me about it.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.074
I've seen him
somewhere else, too.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.238
Yeah, hi,
this is Allison Blake.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.158
Can you send Dr. Brock up
to see me, please?

25:42.916 --> 25:46.158
Really, when?
Okay, thank you.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.752
He left for the day
with a fever.

25:48.797 --> 25:49.912
Uh...

25:55.429 --> 25:56.418
Good afternoon,
Dr. Stark.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.008
Good afternoon.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.885
(BEEPING)

26:08.275 --> 26:09.890
Is there a problem?

26:09.943 --> 26:13.106
Sorry, sir.
For some reason your access
is coming up denied.

26:13.155 --> 26:16.647
Well, I'm pretty sure it's me.
Why don't you just perform
an override?

26:16.742 --> 26:19.358
Regulations require special
authorization for that, sir.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.240
And who would you get that
special authorization from?

26:22.289 --> 26:24.655
Well, you.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.662
Gotta love the irony.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.587
(ON RADIO) Hey, Jo,
it's Carter. You copy?

26:32.633 --> 26:34.373
Lupo. What's up? Over.

26:34.468 --> 26:37.460
Keep your eye out
for a Dr. Ryan Brock.
He's gonna be driving...

26:37.513 --> 26:40.255
A black Subaru Forester.
JO: What did Brock do?

26:40.349 --> 26:43.216
Ah, more was done to him,
just like Wayne and Matthew.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.428
We might have
another fire brewing.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.139
We 're gonna go
to his house right now.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.390
Got it. Over.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.770
Wait. The... Wayne...

26:53.070 --> 26:55.026
Scratch that.
We're gonna, ah, stop
at the dry cleaner.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.729
Wait, what?
How do you know that?

26:56.782 --> 27:01.526
Well, uh, I bumped into Brock
at the dry cleaner the day
we had our first, uh...

27:01.578 --> 27:02.954
First what?

27:04.248 --> 27:06.409
Nothing. I just know.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.084
(HORN HONKING)

27:19.138 --> 27:20.753
DRIVER: Hey! Watch it!

27:20.848 --> 27:23.055
It's Brock!
Damn it! What's
he doing over there?

27:27.729 --> 27:31.187
Dr. Brock! Hey, uh, yeah,
glad we could catch up
with you. You okay?

27:31.233 --> 27:33.895
He's burning up.
I'll call the paramedics.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.855
Actually, I'm not
feeling so hot.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.360
Um, maybe get
the fire extinguisher.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.395
Yeah.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.272
Fire extinguisher?
What's happening to me?

27:40.367 --> 27:43.700
Uh, we don't know, but it's
the same thing that happened
to Wayne Kwan and Rob Matthew.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.360
Rob, too?
Yeah.

27:46.707 --> 27:48.618
Oh, God...
Yeah, who would wanna
do this to you?

27:48.709 --> 27:51.291
I don't know!
Take a seat. Take a... Ow!

27:51.879 --> 27:55.212
Dr... Everybody
clear out! Allison!

27:59.428 --> 28:01.589
CARTER: Over here!
Over here!

28:16.403 --> 28:18.018
Carter, you tried
to save him.

28:18.071 --> 28:22.030
I screwed up.
If I'd been
a little sooner, I...

28:24.870 --> 28:28.909
I'm having trouble
keeping the times straight.
Everything's changed.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.240
What are you
talking about?
What's changed?

28:31.293 --> 28:34.160
Ah, just something
Henry was saying...

28:37.716 --> 28:38.751
Henry.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.008
What about him?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.386
That's where I've seen
Brock before.

28:44.431 --> 28:45.671
Oh, man!

28:56.902 --> 28:58.392
Hey, Henry,
what you working on?

28:58.487 --> 29:01.229
Jack,hey!
Ah, just tinkering.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.489
What's up?

29:05.327 --> 29:08.740
That's what I'm trying to
find out, and I sincerely
hope I'm wrong.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.161
About what?

29:10.207 --> 29:11.993
Could you, uh,
run the hologram?

29:12.042 --> 29:13.407
Just... I need...
There's something
I need to see.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.494
I thought you wanted me
to leave it off, move on,
and all that.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.250
I did. But I just realized
what our victims
have in common.

29:19.341 --> 29:22.174
So, turn it on. Please.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.649
CARTER: Stop it there!

29:56.003 --> 29:58.369
It's them.
It's Brock and Matthew!

29:59.172 --> 30:00.833
Hey, look at that!

30:01.967 --> 30:03.503
You telling me
you didn't know?

30:05.387 --> 30:07.719
Yeah. What are you saying?

30:08.223 --> 30:11.636
I'm saying that everybody
in this room could be held
responsible for Kim's death.

30:11.727 --> 30:15.891
I ruled out the accident,
I ruled out the eclipse,
I ruled out the chili,

30:15.981 --> 30:17.892
or should I say
you did.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.644
You think I'm capable
of murder?

30:19.693 --> 30:22.480
Well, you risked the universe
for her once, why is it
really that different?

30:22.529 --> 30:24.565
Taking a risk and taking
a life are two very
different things,

30:24.656 --> 30:26.237
and I am incapable
of the latter!

30:26.325 --> 30:27.485
Really? Even for Kim?

30:27.576 --> 30:29.237
Especially for Kim!

30:30.495 --> 30:32.656
What are you working
on over there?

30:32.748 --> 30:34.238
(CHUCKLES)

30:34.333 --> 30:35.322
Not what you think.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.408
Well, knowing the lengths
you went to last time
to bring her back,

30:37.502 --> 30:38.582
what do you think I think?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.376
Even if! did
blame those men,

30:40.422 --> 30:43.539
what motivation could
I possibly have
to kill Kevin's therapist?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.214
He wasn't even there!

30:50.974 --> 30:52.054
You're right.

30:55.979 --> 30:56.968
Unless he was.

30:57.064 --> 30:59.396
HENRY: We can see everybody
in the room.

30:59.483 --> 31:00.814
Just a sec.

31:01.443 --> 31:05.402
Can you fast fon/vard this for
a second? Please. You don't
have to watch it again...

31:05.447 --> 31:07.062
HENRY: Yes, I do.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.486
Okay, stop it there!

31:15.499 --> 31:18.411
CARTER: Can I see
the other side
of the room?

31:22.547 --> 31:23.536
Okay.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.262
This might be
a stupid question, but
what exactly killed her?

31:33.725 --> 31:36.717
A concentrated burst
of particulate radiation.

31:37.729 --> 31:38.718
CARTER: Like a...

31:38.772 --> 31:40.103
A shotgun blast.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.563
Shotgun.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.567
What's on the other side
of this wall?

31:48.657 --> 31:51.649
My first year as a Marshal,
I tracked this guy down
to a hotel.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.280
Uh, I kick in the front door,
he comes out of
the bathroom firing,

31:54.413 --> 31:56.495
just barely missing me.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.664
But, the woman in the
next room wasn't so lucky.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.242
A stray bullet.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.122
Yeah.

32:04.506 --> 32:06.792
We have to find out
if anyone was on the
other side of that wall.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.293
Does this mean
you believe me now?

32:11.054 --> 32:12.464
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.018
ALLISON: But the lab behind
the blast wall wasn't damaged
in the accident.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.096
Well, not that
we know of.
Keep scrolling.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.772
HENRY: The radiation from the
artifact is unlike anything
we've seen before.

32:24.818 --> 32:27.025
We don't have equipment
sophisticated enough
to measure it.

32:27.112 --> 32:30.104
Which means that some of it
could have passed through
the wall undetected.

32:30.157 --> 32:33.149
There. Just now.
Who works in that lab?

32:33.243 --> 32:34.733
ALLISON: Um...

32:35.787 --> 32:36.947
ALLISON: Dr. Matthew.

32:37.038 --> 32:40.530
Who was exchanging
frequent phone calls
with Kevin's therapist.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.412
Can you tell if anyone
was in there at the
time of the accident?

32:43.462 --> 32:47.956
Yeah, uh, each lab
in Section Five has
a biometric security scanner.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.914
I can pull up
the entry log.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.543
ALLISON: I can't believe it,
it's Wayne!

32:52.596 --> 32:54.757
And look at the time code,
he should have been
in therapy with Kevin.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.509
What was he doing
in there?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.306
He was visiting
the man downstairs.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.054
Oh, my God, Kevin
could have been
in there with him!

33:00.103 --> 33:01.263
Wait, where is he now?

33:01.354 --> 33:02.855
Uh, in session with Beverly,
Section One.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.184
HENRY: Jack. There was
someone else in that chamber.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.189
Nathan is
the last man standing.

33:07.235 --> 33:10.693
Well, he won't be for long.
Oh, I'll have security
help you find him.

33:39.726 --> 33:40.841
No...

33:47.526 --> 33:49.187
Get him to cryogenics
while there's still time.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.851
GUARD: Yes, sir.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.918
Everything looks fine.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.382
But we'll keep him under
observation just to be
on the safe side.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.751
Thank you.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.095
They found Dr. Stark.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.044
Can you watch
him, please?

34:20.225 --> 34:21.840
HENRY: We have to
cool him down.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.680
I'm so close...
So close to understanding...

34:24.729 --> 34:26.139
Nathan, stay with me!

34:26.231 --> 34:28.267
HENRY:
Just try to stay calm.

34:28.358 --> 34:31.316
(NATHAN BREATHING HEAVILY)

34:33.029 --> 34:35.486
Nathan!
HENRY: He's overloading.
Like the others.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.568
BEVERLY: It looks like
a massive seizure.

34:37.659 --> 34:38.648
HENRY: It is.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.483
From what?
Exposure to the...

34:40.579 --> 34:42.570
Henry!
That's classified.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.998
His temperature's
up to 104.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.954
Okay, the seizure's frying
his electrical system.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.036
We... Can we shut it down?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.954
BEVERLY: You shut down
the system, he dies.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.960
Well, not the whole thing,
just the bit of it
that's misfiring,

34:55.051 --> 34:57.463
you know, like,
tripping a breaker?
Maybe we can.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.010
BEVERLY: How?
Fight fire with misfire.

34:59.055 --> 35:02.343
Jack is right. We don't have
to shut down the circuit.
We just have to disrupt it!

35:02.392 --> 35:04.383
Great. How do we do it?
HENRY: Electroshock therapy.

35:04.477 --> 35:05.466
No!

35:05.729 --> 35:07.560
Small silver box.
Got it!

35:07.647 --> 35:11.856
They have used electroshock
therapy very effectively
to disrupt seizure disorder.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.402
Yes, in dealing with epilepsy!

35:13.486 --> 35:14.987
But we have no idea
how that will affect

35:15.071 --> 35:16.402
what's going on
inside of his head!

35:16.489 --> 35:17.740
And we don't have time
to fight about it!

35:17.824 --> 35:19.064
Allison!

35:22.329 --> 35:23.694
He's right.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.661
Are you sure?

35:25.707 --> 35:27.117
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

35:27.167 --> 35:28.623
Please don't
burst into flames.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.873
I'll do my best.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.204
CARTER: All right,
hang in there.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.506
Oh, Sheriff,
I didn't know you cared.

35:36.551 --> 35:37.711
Oh, I don't.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.880
WOMAN: Systems are online.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.346
You ready?

35:47.395 --> 35:50.558
Henry? Sorry about Kim.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.689
I know.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.734
(SCREAMING)

36:16.800 --> 36:18.381
How are you feeling?

36:18.468 --> 36:21.960
Oh, like someone
microwaved my brain.
But besides that...

36:22.389 --> 36:26.223
Well, your fever topped 106.
We were all really worried.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.929
Me burst into flames?

36:29.479 --> 36:32.061
I'm not giving the DOD.
the satisfaction!

36:32.107 --> 36:33.563
I really am sorry, Nathan.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.229
Don't be.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.903
You made the right choice.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.275
You mean that?

36:42.409 --> 36:43.740
Absolutely.

36:44.077 --> 36:48.537
After everything's that's
happened, I don't even think
I could do the job anymore.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.365
You might be just
what this place needs.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.042
This place still
needs you, too.

37:06.224 --> 37:10.012
Well, I should probably
let you get some rest.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.102
Nathan, can I ask you
something?

37:20.155 --> 37:21.270
Sure.

37:22.115 --> 37:25.699
What was Kevin's therapist
doing in a lab
in Section Five?

37:27.036 --> 37:28.492
I wish I knew.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.035
Hey, Henry.

37:37.505 --> 37:41.714
Jack! I hear, um,
Nathan's on the mend.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.716
Oh, sure! Rub it in!

37:46.264 --> 37:51.258
Huh. Allie has that book...
Had that book,
in the other timeline.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.227
You okay?
No, you're right.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.436
Every time I try to make
things happen with Allie
the way they did before,

37:58.485 --> 38:00.021
the more they change.

38:00.111 --> 38:03.729
Tonight was supposed
to be our first date.

38:04.407 --> 38:07.695
Stark was supposed
to take the job
in San Francisco.

38:09.037 --> 38:12.700
And instead she's
holding his hand,
convincing him to stay.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.705
And, uh,

38:20.215 --> 38:21.876
I'm sorry
I suspected you.

38:24.511 --> 38:27.218
You were just
following your instincts.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.221
Yeah. Which are all wrong.

38:32.185 --> 38:33.516
I mean...

38:34.562 --> 38:36.598
I thought it would be
easier this time around.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.270
I thought, uh,
it would be fun.

38:38.358 --> 38:40.724
You know, like I could
do things better.

38:40.860 --> 38:44.853
Well, instead,
uh, a man died,

38:46.407 --> 38:48.534
and I accused you of murder,

38:52.580 --> 38:55.663
and the woman I love
is slipping away.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.119
Nah, I don't...
I don't know
if I can do this.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.631
Maybe you won't have to.

39:08.721 --> 39:09.710
And what is that?

39:09.806 --> 39:13.219
It's a modified version
of the memory neutralizer
that I designed years ago.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.517
The original was like
a shotgun, erasing
short-term memory.

39:16.563 --> 39:20.556
This one erases
long-term memory but
is much more precise.

39:20.608 --> 39:24.100
It can pinpoint the neural
pathways associated with
specific experiences

39:24.195 --> 39:25.696
and time periods.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.320
You want to erase
your memory from
the other timeline?

39:28.366 --> 39:30.982
I want to erase
our memories.

39:33.538 --> 39:37.030
Whoa... I...
Jack, you're
my closest friend.

39:37.500 --> 39:42.620
And intellectually I know
that you had to prevent me
from saving Kim,

39:42.714 --> 39:45.706
but emotionally
I blame you for her death!

39:45.800 --> 39:48.462
I can't look at you
without thinking that
you're the one who did this,

39:48.553 --> 39:51.215
that you're the one
who took her away
from me.

39:52.473 --> 39:53.974
I wish there had been
another choice.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.719
I know.

39:55.810 --> 39:59.553
But the pain that
I feel every day
that she's not here,

39:59.606 --> 40:04.225
the pain that you feel
knowing that you're not
gonna be with Allison,

40:04.319 --> 40:07.857
that you're not gonna be
meeting the child that
you were having together,

40:07.864 --> 40:10.321
this takes all that away.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.871
Can we keep some of the
memories? 'Cause there was
this one time with Allison...

40:17.957 --> 40:21.541
Jack. I'm afraid it has
to be all or nothing.

40:23.713 --> 40:24.873
You're really
gonna do this?

40:24.964 --> 40:26.204
We have to.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.168
And who would go first?
I'll make it easy for you.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.883
I hear Nathan's
on the mend!

40:34.974 --> 40:37.056
Oh, sure, rub it in!

40:39.145 --> 40:40.134
Mmm.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.271
My head is killing me.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.474
You okay?

40:46.486 --> 40:47.726
Yeah...

40:48.780 --> 40:49.986
What...

40:51.532 --> 40:53.193
Can I borrow this?

40:53.743 --> 40:54.949
Sure.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.492
Huh.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.034
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.967
(DOOR CLOSING)

41:10.802 --> 41:12.884
And I will never forget.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.113
HENRY: Good morning, Allison.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.483
Henry! You look nice.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.531
Going for
a job interview?

41:35.618 --> 41:37.119
Actually, I am.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.492
I, uh...

41:39.122 --> 41:42.034
I want to work
at Global Dynamics.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.384
BEVERLY: Congressman Faraday.

42:04.397 --> 42:09.061
According to Nathan Stark,
the artifact appears
to be dead.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.855
That isn't possible.

42:11.863 --> 42:16.197
I said "appears."
Energy of that magnitude
doesn't just die.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.900
It had to go somewhere.

42:26.544 --> 42:27.954
Kevin, honey,
dinner's ready!

42:29.464 --> 42:31.375
ALLISON: Come on, baby.
