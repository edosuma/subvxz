00:02.160 --> 00:03.082
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.240 --> 00:05.766
Got an ID on your not-so-secret
but very crazy admirer.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.564
Carrie Cutter. She's former SCPD.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.484
Love is a bullet in the brain.

00:09.680 --> 00:10.681
My hero.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.201
I'm Cupid, stupid.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.401
And if I don't help you?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.689
I think I made it abundantly clear,
you don't have a choice.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.006
Are you working for Damien Darhk?

00:19.240 --> 00:21.527
I did what I had to do to keep you safe!

00:21.720 --> 00:25.691
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.524
- Who's William?
- He's my son.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.645
Oliver, we need to talk. I can't do this.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.882
Felicity...

00:36.080 --> 00:38.082
Oh, my God!

00:44.200 --> 00:46.965
<i>Let me call you sweetheart</i>

00:47.160 --> 00:49.049
It's okay. It's okay.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.609
<i>I'm in love with you</i>

00:59.720 --> 01:04.486
<i>That you love me too</i>

01:08.240 --> 01:10.163
Whatever you're thinking of doing,
you don't have to.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.283
Please. Just let us go.
We won't tell anyone.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.204
No one. Absolutely not. Right?

01:14.400 --> 01:18.291
Wonderful! Agreement.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.643
The mortar that holds together
the bricks of love.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.602
So how much do you love each other?

01:28.440 --> 01:29.680
With everything that I have.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.886
And the missus?

01:34.800 --> 01:37.406
How much does she love her mister?

01:38.320 --> 01:39.765
More than anything in the world.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.650
How sweet. And pathetic.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.561
What?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.842
"Love is a bullet to the brain."

01:52.240 --> 01:54.447
Or an arrow to the heart.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.486
Please be seated.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.360
First, I'll hear the parties
on the question of bail.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.801
Your Honor,
the defendant wishes to waive bail

02:11.160 --> 02:14.448
so that the court can focus its attention
on our motion to dismiss.

02:14.680 --> 02:18.321
Your Honor, the defendant was apprehended
at the site of a child abduction.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.847
Because he was being held captive himself.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.486
Your Honor, these documents will confirm

02:24.680 --> 02:29.208
my client's identity as Kenneth Bender,
citizen of Markovia.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.967
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.
The defendant's name is Damien Darhk.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.447
According to whom? You?
Oliver Queen? The media?

02:35.640 --> 02:38.644
Your Honor,
there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever

02:38.880 --> 02:41.121
<i>to suggest that my client
is this Damien Darhk,</i>

02:41.320 --> 02:43.209
much less prove beyond a reasonable doubt

02:43.400 --> 02:46.290
that he committed these acts
that Damien Darhk is even accused of.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.564
Your Honor, we have evidence
and we will present it at trial.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.844
During which time,
what, my client just rots in jail?

02:53.160 --> 02:55.003
<i>I mean, fortunately,
he's no longer in Markovia, right?</i>

02:55.200 --> 02:56.201
Because in America...

02:56.440 --> 02:58.363
We have preliminary hearings to determine

02:58.560 --> 03:00.528
whether the State can meet
its burden of proof.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.247
Your Honor...

03:02.440 --> 03:04.124
<i>You say you have evidence, Ms. Lance.</i>

03:04.360 --> 03:06.010
Get ready to present it.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.602
Mr. Darhk, or Mr. Bender
or whatever he's calling himself,

03:09.880 --> 03:12.804
<i>is hereby remanded to the custody
of the Department of Corrections,</i>

03:13.040 --> 03:16.408
to be held until disposition
of defendant's motion to dismiss.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.610
I worked out a system to maximize
the efficiency of the moving process.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.442
The densest, heaviest boxes
are put into the moving truck first,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.324
creating a solid foundation
for the rest of the boxes,

03:36.520 --> 03:38.522
and providing maximum recovery time

03:38.720 --> 03:40.609
during the most physical moments
of moving.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.169
There's, um, less chance for injury, too.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.441
I hired a mover.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.081
And I would never want to step on the toes
of professionals,

03:49.320 --> 03:50.731
but proper distribution of the mass

03:50.920 --> 03:52.922
and density of the boxes
inside the moving truck

03:53.120 --> 03:54.929
could have a cost-saving effects
for the moving company

03:55.120 --> 03:56.610
in the form of improved gas mileage.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.283
Okay. Great.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.442
So, you're doing great.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.768
It's just amazing how much progress
you've made in such little time.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.089
Paul must be just
a physical therapy genius.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.930
Yeah, like a symphony of the talents,

04:13.200 --> 04:15.407
you know, Curtis and Paul,
they're kind of the perfect team.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.765
You know, marrying tech...

04:21.720 --> 04:24.530
Poor choice of words.
My bad. My specialty.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.331
It's okay. That's fine. l...

04:27.680 --> 04:32.129
You see, it's not like, um...
I don't know what it's like.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.010
We were engaged.
And now we're not together.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.086
That's what it's like.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.051
Could you cancel the venue, please?

04:40.560 --> 04:41.527
Uh...

04:41.760 --> 04:43.728
Yes, I will get around
to canceling the venue.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.405
Great. Thank you.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.002
And I will un-invite the guests.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.001
Okay.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.924
The movers will swing by
whenever you want.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.321
<i>Just give them a call.</i>

04:57.320 --> 04:58.651
I'll see you when I see you.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.085
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

05:03.720 --> 05:04.846
Yeah, tonight I, uh...

05:06.560 --> 05:07.607
I mean, I guess we didn't talk about it,

05:07.840 --> 05:10.320
but I was a part of the team
before we were together. I just assumed...

05:10.800 --> 05:14.407
Oh! Tonight.
Like every night. Um...

05:16.400 --> 05:20.724
Of course. You are a part of the team.
Forever and always.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.526
Keep movin'!

05:43.800 --> 05:47.441
Stop here. This is it.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.206
<i>Okay, well, now that you've found
what you're looking for,</i>

05:50.440 --> 05:51.601
you don't need us, so we can just...

05:51.760 --> 05:54.286
No. This isn't the end, Mr. Queen.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.046
- It's the beginning.
- Of what?

05:58.280 --> 06:00.282
<i>I grew up in a small village in Africa.</i>

06:00.600 --> 06:04.207
A country whose name has changed
a dozen times over the years.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.444
One day, bandits came to my village.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.647
They wanted water and gold and women.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.370
<i>Once they left with them,</i>

06:14.640 --> 06:18.122
the only thing remaining of my village
was ash.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.484
My home and everyone I loved
was wiped from the earth.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.122
And I was helpless to stop it.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.483
And I swore I would never feel
helpless again.

06:29.800 --> 06:33.168
So killing all the people you're holding
hostages can help you not feel helpless?

06:34.640 --> 06:39.487
How does that make you any different than
the people who destroyed your village?

06:40.000 --> 06:40.922
Oh...

06:41.160 --> 06:44.164
it makes me very different.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.567
Let me show you.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.925
How'd it go out there tonight?

06:58.400 --> 06:59.731
It was quiet.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.363
Yeah, this city hasn't had a quiet night
in four years.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.530
Yeah, I can't believe HIVE is silent
just because Damien Darhk's in jail.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.927
- Not for long.
- What are you talking about?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.049
The law's pesky need for evidence.

07:11.280 --> 07:15.285
The Ghosts who took William also took
their cyanide escape plans.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.568
- There's no one to testify against Darhk.
- What about my brother?

07:17.760 --> 07:20.081
You mean the one that was declared
legally dead five years ago?

07:21.680 --> 07:23.523
It should be fun walking him into court.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.206
What about us?

07:25.760 --> 07:27.205
Yeah, Damien kidnapped us
over the holiday.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.044
- We're all witnesses.
- Actually, that's good.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.931
The fiancÃ© to the city's
beloved mayoral candidate,

07:32.200 --> 07:33.964
it makes for a compelling story.

07:36.880 --> 07:37.961
What's wrong?

07:38.200 --> 07:39.611
Oliver and I aren't engaged anymore.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.881
Um, or living together.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.201
Or together together.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.721
- Felicity...
- It's fine.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.721
Which is universal code for
"I don't wanna talk about it."

07:55.040 --> 07:57.566
- Pieces of Darhk's idol, huh?
- Yeah.

07:57.880 --> 07:58.881
How're you holding up?

07:59.440 --> 08:01.249
Felicity tell you guys?

08:01.560 --> 08:03.085
How're you holding up?

08:04.720 --> 08:05.721
Is this about your son?

08:06.120 --> 08:09.090
The fact that I lied to her about him,
yeah.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.641
Well, you got a kid, man.
That's a whole lot to handle.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.245
But don't worry, she'll come around.
Give her time.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.483
I mean, she wants to stay on the team.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.243
That's a good sign.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.686
- I think.
- Hey.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.289
Lance just called. It's trouble.

08:25.640 --> 08:26.766
HIVE?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.004
He said it was an old friend.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.124
All right, you guys take five.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.287
Hey, you okay?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.284
You do look a little more grim than usual.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.762
Just let me know who did this.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.126
Look familiar?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.441
Cupid.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.803
She's supposed to be in custody
at A.R.G.U.S.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.201
Yeah?

08:54.120 --> 08:55.360
Tell that to them.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.847
What was there?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.281
She left a note for us.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.485
"Love is dead."

09:16.560 --> 09:21.168
So, is nobody else going to say it?
"It's Cupid, stupid."

09:21.480 --> 09:24.165
Well, she's changed up her M.O. a little.
"Love is dead."

09:24.360 --> 09:26.328
Ah! Maybe she's not so insane after all.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.528
I thought she was locked up
in some A.R.G.U.S sub-basement?

09:28.720 --> 09:29.721
Yeah, not anymore.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.684
Just talked to Lyla,
turns out Waller was serious

09:31.920 --> 09:35.003
about prisoners like Cupid
working their way off of Task Force X.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.169
- She's out.
- Then we start with her victims.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.164
- Did CSU ID them?
- They're running prints.

09:39.480 --> 09:43.883
Like, seriously? None of your crime
tech guys read gossip websites?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.483
Uh... Let's assume they don't.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.523
'Cause this is Blaine and this is Shannon.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.841
Okay?

09:51.520 --> 09:56.367
Really, guys? Come on,
it's the wedding of the decade.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.006
Why would Cupid wanna ice
Star City's most high-profile couple?

09:59.240 --> 10:01.641
Well, we figure that out, we figure out
who her next targets might be.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.171
How do you know
there's gonna be a next target?

10:03.360 --> 10:05.647
I don't think that Carrie Cutter
has changed that much.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.807
We got to get to court.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.202
I'm gonna stay here,
work up some leads on Cupid.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.005
It was the Oliver Queen
Campaign holiday party.

10:15.880 --> 10:16.881
There was gunfire.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.884
The security that we had on site
was killed.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.041
And then he walked in.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.204
Let the record reflect that
the witness is pointing to the defendant.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.720
And why did the defendant walk
in to Oliver Queen's campaign office?

10:29.040 --> 10:30.405
He was the leader of the gunmen.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.087
He took myself, Thea Queen,
and Felicity Smoak hostage.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.044
And while you were held hostage...

10:35.440 --> 10:39.047
Damien Darhk, or whatever
he calls himself, was there,

10:39.760 --> 10:42.684
calling the shots, the entire time.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.206
Pass the witness.

10:48.080 --> 10:54.201
This, uh, holiday party.
Were you there as a guest?

10:54.400 --> 10:57.449
No, sir. I work security,
personal security for Mr. Oliver Queen.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.966
I have been for the past three-plus years.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.403
Even after Mr. Queen lost his job
as CEO of Queen Consolidated?

11:02.720 --> 11:05.246
I mean, how much does he pay you?
Ten cents an hour?

11:05.400 --> 11:07.243
Objection. Relevance.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.768
Sustained. Move faster, Mr. Fitzmartin.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.081
<i>Of course, Your Honor.</i>

11:11.440 --> 11:17.447
All right, well, let's talk about
your alleged co-captive, Thea Queen.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.771
Isn't it true that five months ago,

11:20.040 --> 11:23.567
you helped her buy
$74,000 worth of cocaine?

11:24.920 --> 11:25.921
<i>And before you answer that,</i>

11:26.120 --> 11:28.885
you should know that I have a signed
affidavit from Ms. Queen's dealer,

11:29.120 --> 11:30.121
right here.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.725
Which means nothing
because it is irrelevant.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.281
Well, it goes to credibility, Your Honor.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.807
<i>Oliver Queen publicly slandered my client</i>

11:36.960 --> 11:39.804
<i>by accusing him
of ordering a terrorist drone strike.</i>

11:40.080 --> 11:43.129
Now, if Mr. Diggle can work
for Mr. Queen for free,

11:43.440 --> 11:45.807
<i>to help Ms. Queen buy illegal drugs,
I mean,</i>

11:46.120 --> 11:48.805
<i>is it really that much of a stretch to
believe that he'd also perjure himself</i>

11:49.000 --> 11:51.128
in support of Mr. Queen's campaign
of character assassination?

11:51.320 --> 11:52.970
You watched me swear an oath!

11:54.080 --> 11:55.923
And then I saw you break it.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.809
No further questions, Your Honor.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.603
I don't have a law degree,
but I don't think that went well.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.801
It could've been worse.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.804
If Fitzmartin kept pulling
on those threads,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.162
then everything that we've done
for the city could've been exposed.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.606
Worth it to put Darhk away.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.131
Except it wouldn't put him away.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.004
Because vigilantes
don't make good witnesses?

12:18.280 --> 12:20.886
No, but they make excellent inmates.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.321
Yeah.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.606
Okay, so where does this leave us?

12:23.840 --> 12:25.001
We can't just let Darhk walk.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.051
Well, unless I come up with a witness
who Fitzmartin can't tear apart,

12:28.320 --> 12:29.321
then that's what's going to happen.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.846
Then put me on the stand.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.841
<i>I don't have a secret identity.</i>

12:33.120 --> 12:35.009
And I can testify about Darhk
and his connection to HIVE.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.850
And spend the rest of your life in jail.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.685
If it's in a cell next to Darhk,
it'd be worth it.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.042
No. We'll find another way.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.527
- It's Felicity.
- Uh...

12:43.720 --> 12:44.881
Put her on speaker.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.690
Felicity, we have the whole team here.
What's up?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.325
Good news is, I've got Cupid's location.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.521
<i>Good. Where is she?</i>

12:49.680 --> 12:52.331
That's the bad news. Looks like she's
kidnapped another celebrity couple.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.851
<i>Allison Lee and Robert Joyce.</i>

12:54.080 --> 12:55.081
Allibert.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.810
Track the GPS in their phones.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.520
When I said I had their location,
how did you think that I got it?

13:00.680 --> 13:02.842
Okay, Felicity, what's next?
Where are we going?

13:05.520 --> 13:06.760
They're on the move
headed towards Pennytown.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.002
- Got it.
- I'd suit up with you...

13:09.200 --> 13:12.170
No, what you're doing here
is more important. Get Darhk.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.850
Get Cupid.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.566
"'Till death do us part."

13:25.560 --> 13:28.040
Don't worry.
You won't have to wait that long.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.845
Wedding crashers. Hold on tight.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.281
Speedy, look out!

14:36.920 --> 14:37.921
She's in the center.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.124
- I'm okay.
- Stay with Speedy.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.608
<i>- Let them help</i> you.
<i>- I'll get Cupid.</i>

15:15.600 --> 15:17.602
I'd say enjoy the afterlife,

15:17.840 --> 15:20.446
but we both know
that's just eternal nothingness.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.763
I was in love with the Arrow,
but you're not him.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.204
Although I do like the sleeveless.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.046
Got her.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.290
I guess you didn't have her.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.848
Really brings a whole new meaning
to crazy ex-girlfriend,

16:09.200 --> 16:11.567
and you didn't even get to enjoy
the fun parts.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.166
Sorry.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.970
Well, Cutter fell for Floyd Lawton
last year.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.486
Lucky QUY-

16:17.720 --> 16:19.085
She was heartbroken when he was blown up.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.165
No, Thea's right though.
Cutter is pathological.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.050
I mean, targeting happy couples? Come on!

16:24.240 --> 16:26.686
Well, it makes sense
if you look at it from her perspective.

16:26.920 --> 16:31.767
Love betrayed her
and now she wants to go to war against it.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.890
And then that's making sense?

16:35.080 --> 16:37.003
It makes sense to her.

16:37.240 --> 16:41.040
Okay.
She's not just targeting regular couples.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.050
She's targeting celebrity couples.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.527
Probably to bring attention
to her anti-love crusade.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.762
Lance is getting the word out,
he assigned a protective detail.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.764
I'm gonna run forensics on this.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.731
We're gonna hit the streets,
see if we can get a line on Cutter.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.605
Okay. You wanna talk about
the other obvious problem?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.241
- Yeah, the elephant in the room?
- Felicity and I are fine.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.124
If you were
listening to her little asides,

17:01.280 --> 17:02.361
you would know that was not true.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.564
John, you were the one
who told me to give her time.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.240
Okay. Do you want to get back together
with her?

17:08.440 --> 17:10.282
- I do.
- Then tell her that.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.125
Even if you fall on your face, Oliver,
she needs to know where you stand.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.931
She needs to know
that you're willing to say the words.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.930
- I am willing to say the words.
- That's <i>good.</i>

17:18.119 --> 17:19.121
So what's stopping you?

17:24.640 --> 17:28.565
- Why did you do that?
- Don't! Let him die.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.564
What? You're insane!

17:30.880 --> 17:35.329
The difference between insanity and belief
lies only in the number of believers.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.642
This is the power of a single life.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.810
Above us, I have dozens under my control.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.684
The prisoners are gathered topside.
The men are in position.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.525
Tell them to shoot.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.602
Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go!

18:24.280 --> 18:25.281
Hey-

18:27.240 --> 18:28.969
So how'd the rest of the day in court go?

18:29.200 --> 18:31.680
If it went well,
I wouldn't be here still doing this.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.890
Listen, I was thinkin',

18:34.080 --> 18:35.889
what about all the rest of the people
at the holiday party?

18:36.080 --> 18:37.525
- All right? 'Cause they all saw Darhk.
- Yeah.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.729
It's probably
why they're all too frightened to testify.

18:39.920 --> 18:40.967
We could subpoena 'em.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.040
I did that this afternoon.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.131
One lied,

18:45.360 --> 18:47.840
one in jail
because they refused to testify,

18:48.120 --> 18:51.203
and one actually tried pleading the Fifth.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.002
Well, I told you,
there's one guy willing to take the stand.

18:55.240 --> 18:59.245
Dad, I went to my boss and I asked him
to give you immunity from prosecution.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.640
He said he'd prefer to be re-elected.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.803
- I don't care about immunity.
- But I do.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.082
Dad, I'm not gonna let you
incriminate yourself.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.801
You wouldn't be doing anything.
It'd be me. And it'd be right.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.291
I'm the one who got into bed with Darhk.
But I made those decisions

19:13.560 --> 19:15.369
and I should pay the consequences
to 'em, honey.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.005
And, listen,
it's the only way to bring him down.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.808
Okay. Okay.

19:27.160 --> 19:31.085
If we do this, you will also testify
that you acted under duress.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.241
- That Damien threatened my life.
- Yeah.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.288
'Cause that way I get to say on record
how much I love my baby girl.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.841
Okay.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.086
Felicity Scissorhands.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.328
Struck out
trying to find a line on Cutter.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.567
What's this?

19:49.760 --> 19:52.809
I couldn't exactly fit the entire sleeve
into the gas chromatograph.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.771
Speak of the devil.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.283
The sleeve contains fibers from at least
60 different types of white silk lace.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.364
- White lace. Like in wedding dresses?
- That would be ironic.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.927
And also traces of acid-free
polypropylene.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.731
- What do they use that for?
- Long term storage of fabrics.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.764
Well, maybe Cutter's holed up in a spot
where they store wedding dresses.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.521
Colao Wedding Dress Services is the only
long-term storage facility in the city

20:16.720 --> 20:19.200
that uses polypropylene.
Twenty-eighth and Hamilton.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.528
That is two blocks
from where she posed the first victims.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.081
The only movement
I'm tracking in that building is you guys.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.606
Stay alert.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.287
Got something.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.407
Whoa!

21:07.600 --> 21:09.682
<i>She does love her shrines, doesn't she?</i>

21:10.080 --> 21:11.730
Now we know how she's picking her targets.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.891
The first two couples,
they're both recently gotten married.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.441
Cutter abducted the second couple
after their wedding.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.041
Yeah.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.486
Yeah. But Blaine and Shannon, "Blannon",

21:22.680 --> 21:25.490
had a secret wedding 48 hours
before they were killed.

21:25.760 --> 21:29.685
Now we have to figure out what celebrity
couple in the city's getting married next.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.888
I think I found one we can rule out.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.684
So, by calling off the engagement,

21:38.880 --> 21:40.689
we took ourselves
out of Cupid's crosshairs.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.848
I knew there had to be
at least one silver lining.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.929
Well, if she keeps on targeting
high-profile weddings,

21:45.240 --> 21:46.765
we just got to stake out
whatever the next one is.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.008
That's a big risk
to run with an innocent couple.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.402
We're not gonna take that risk
with an innocent couple.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.167
Hey-

21:55.560 --> 21:57.483
We need to get married.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.001
How romantic.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.568
- It's, Felicity...
- This is the worst idea you've ever had!

22:06.800 --> 22:08.040
Actually, it's not the worst.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.281
<i>Et tu, John'?</i>

22:09.480 --> 22:11.926
We lost our leads on Cutter, Felicity.
This might draw her out.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.326
Oh, so she can kill me?

22:13.560 --> 22:14.766
- Pass. No, thank you.
- Okay.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.720
No, John and I will have your back.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.411
Guess it's too bad I already sent out
all those "un-invitations."

22:21.600 --> 22:23.921
Clearly, none of you guys spend any time
on gossip sites.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.250
Okay, look,

22:26.440 --> 22:29.887
these bloggers love nothing
more than a private, secret wedding.

22:30.360 --> 22:34.604
I leak the news, saying you guys
wanted to keep it under radar...

22:34.960 --> 22:39.363
it becomes the top story on their website.
It's Catnip for Cupid.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.602
Okay, look,
we have to do this quickly, okay?

22:41.880 --> 22:44.929
So Cupid doesn't change her M.O.
and start killing more innocent couples.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.770
- Can we do this tomorrow?
- Tomorrow will work.

22:47.960 --> 22:51.089
The venue still has our deposit, though.
We'll be able to move up the date.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.964
I thought you said you were
gonna cancel that?

22:53.280 --> 22:55.044
I did say that I was gonna cancel,
and I am going to cancel,

22:55.240 --> 22:56.924
but I haven't canceled yet.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.607
Because when I picked up the...

23:00.880 --> 23:02.962
When I pick up the phone to do that,
it means it's over.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.525
It is over.

23:14.600 --> 23:19.367
Hey. Taiana, wait. I think we lost them.

23:19.680 --> 23:25.323
Look. Reiter is not gonna issue kill order
if he doesn't have that thing nearby.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.404
You grabbing it, you saved us.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.042
If that's true,
then we should destroy the damn thing.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.967
- Oliver Queen.
- You took his radio?

23:37.160 --> 23:39.401
<i>I know you're still down here, Mr. Queen.</i>

23:39.760 --> 23:42.445
You should have studied those maps
more closely.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.843
The only way out of these tunnels
is back the way you came.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.565
Which means going through me.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.848
<i>You can either return of your own accord,</i>

23:50.360 --> 23:54.001
or you can force me to come and find you.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.011
<i>But don't bother trying to fight
your way out of this.</i>

23:57.520 --> 24:02.526
After all, I'm the only one of us
who has men and guns.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.323
Last August,
Darhk asked me for the vacation plans

24:10.520 --> 24:12.204
for the Chief of the Fire Department.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.447
Objection.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.326
Darhk. Bender.
Whatever he wants to call himself.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.251
I told him where Chief Reynolds was
staying, the next day the place blows up.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.965
Objection. Conjecture.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.642
Something you're free to challenge
on cross examination. Continue, Ms. Lance.

24:26.280 --> 24:29.762
What else did you do for the defendant?

24:29.960 --> 24:33.885
He wanted me to give him access
to the SCPD computer network.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.481
I did it.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.642
He wanted me to give him
the departmental patrol schedules.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.046
I did that.

24:42.200 --> 24:47.286
He wanted me to break into a federal
server farm to install a computer virus,

24:47.480 --> 24:48.481
and I did that.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.561
He wanted me to give him information
on the city's leadership, and I...

24:55.320 --> 24:56.446
I did that.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.402
And three days later,
the city leadership were all dead.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.843
You did all of these things
for the defendant?

25:03.080 --> 25:05.731
The defendant and the organization
he works for. He called it HIVE.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.843
Objection. Your Honor, it's hearsay.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.644
Statement against interests, Your Honor.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.921
Overruled.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.728
Captain Lance,
why would you do these things?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.924
At first, I didn't know his intentions.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.770
Like with the Fire Chief.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.761
But when I confronted Darhk about it,

25:23.920 --> 25:26.969
he told me that if I didn't do
everything he asked,

25:27.400 --> 25:31.610
everything he told me to do,

25:32.960 --> 25:34.200
he'd have you killed.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.211
No more questions, Your Honor.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.645
Mr. Fitzmartin, your witness.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.962
Captain Lance,
have you ever personally witnessed

25:51.120 --> 25:53.646
my client commit any illegal act?

25:53.880 --> 25:55.769
Well, I'm pretty sure that threatening
the daughter

25:55.960 --> 25:56.927
of a police captain
isn't legal, counselor.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.246
- Objection.
- Overruled.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.164
You know, the fact of the matter is,

26:00.600 --> 26:04.127
I've seen your client in his
little hidey-hole, with his little men.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.401
Ghosts, he calls 'em.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.167
And I've heard him say repeatedly
how he wants to destroy this city.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.441
And that if I didn't help him do it,
then he'd kill my daughter.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.849
By saying all these things,
I'm setting a match to my career.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.685
Maybe my life.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.846
So why would I be doin' that
if everything I'm saying isn't true?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.001
In position.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.527
In position.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.367
There's no psychopaths here
other than paparazzi.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.844
I'm tapped into the security cameras.
All clear.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.885
Everything okay?

27:06.560 --> 27:07.800
Yes. Yeah.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.724
You look perfect.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.561
Thanks.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.682
I'd like to assure you I won't breathe
a word of what goes on here to the press.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.729
- I'm just thrilled to be part of your day.
- Thank you.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.041
- Can we get this over with?
- Hmm.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.887
Can't wait to be
married to this guy!

27:25.960 --> 27:28.691
In that case,
I know you've written your own vows.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.402
- Felicity.
- Vows?

27:31.680 --> 27:32.681
Yeah.

27:32.920 --> 27:33.921
Okay.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.161
Um...

27:37.520 --> 27:41.320
Oliver, you have many qualities.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.244
Many astonishing qualities.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.364
And I, for one, cannot wait
to move on to the next chapter.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.889
All right. Oliver?

27:52.880 --> 27:54.689
Felicity...

27:56.200 --> 28:01.286
Before I met you, I had a plan.
I had a way that it was gonna be.

28:03.080 --> 28:07.563
But then you walked into my life,
all right.

28:08.760 --> 28:14.927
I showed up in your cubicle
and you changed everything.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.605
I was in darkness.

28:20.240 --> 28:24.529
But with your kindness,

28:24.760 --> 28:31.484
your generosity, your compassion, your
intelligence, your wit, and your trust,

28:33.560 --> 28:35.244
you brought me into the light.

28:37.280 --> 28:42.127
And you let me know that I deserved it.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.803
You were that light.

28:49.120 --> 28:52.124
And I don't know
if I still deserve that trust.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.171
If I deserve you.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.845
I probably don't.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.686
But whatever's happened,
whatever will happen,

29:05.000 --> 29:09.847
the way that you make me feel,
is the best part of my life.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.967
You could ask me to say
that I don't love you.

29:18.520 --> 29:23.003
And I will never lie to you again.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.691
You are my always.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.847
And I just want the chance to be yours.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.885
Oliver...

29:34.840 --> 29:36.205
Hello, lovers.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.526
Run!

29:40.680 --> 29:41.681
We have eyes on?

29:41.920 --> 29:42.887
Copy that. I'm here.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.730
Yeah, we got that. Hold tight.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.243
Your little speech
was only off by a little.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.528
See, she isn't the best thing in your life
because that means you love her.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.367
And love means you're soft.

29:56.720 --> 30:00.042
And soft, means death.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.241
<i>Here, let me show you.</i>

30:06.600 --> 30:10.047
Oh, sorry I didn't check
your gift registry.

30:13.600 --> 30:18.288
Was an explosion that would bring down
this whole building on your list?

30:29.920 --> 30:32.127
Your engagement, that horrible shooting,

30:32.360 --> 30:34.931
your miracle recovery,

30:35.120 --> 30:37.043
that was all just a fairy tale.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.449
Camelot in Star City.

30:39.640 --> 30:40.641
Thank you.

30:40.920 --> 30:45.050
But once Camelot dies,
everyone will know my truth.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.765
That love is a bullet to the brain.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.122
No. No, it's not.

30:57.720 --> 31:02.487
Kevlar under the tux.
My bodyguard insisted.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.610
What was his plan for C-four?

31:06.080 --> 31:07.127
That's a damn good question.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.921
- You know, you don't have to do this.
- I do.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.130
The two words that start every marriage.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.601
<i>"I'll do."!</i>

31:17.920 --> 31:22.482
True love. People need to see it,
they need to know what a joke that is.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.001
It's not.

31:24.240 --> 31:28.962
I have loved two men in my life.

31:29.480 --> 31:30.766
With all my soul.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.810
They're both dead now.

31:35.800 --> 31:39.327
No matter what, love always ends in death.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.484
<i>That's why it's in the vows.</i>

31:41.800 --> 31:43.802
I'm just cutting out the middle man.

31:45.600 --> 31:49.207
Love is death.

31:49.480 --> 31:53.326
It's not.
You saw all those people outside, right?

31:54.840 --> 31:57.571
They're out there because love is real,

31:58.360 --> 32:03.002
because love is life itself.

32:03.520 --> 32:08.845
And if I die tonight, it'll be okay,

32:10.240 --> 32:14.325
because I was one of those people
lucky enough to have experienced it.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.047
From the moment he walked into my life,
everything changed.

32:19.320 --> 32:22.529
I became a person that I didn't even know
I was capable of becoming.

32:22.720 --> 32:26.202
I became the very best version of myself.

32:26.880 --> 32:31.568
That would have never have been possible
without our love.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.410
Our love gives my life meaning,
it gives my life a purpose,

32:38.080 --> 32:43.928
and it brings us more joy
than you can ever take away from us.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.567
And it's worth living for.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.366
All of it.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.370
You really know how to make a girl
believe in love again.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.007
Are you all right?

33:31.320 --> 33:32.481
Yeah.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.521
Step back, please.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.171
<i>"REPORTER". What happened inside there?</i>

33:48.680 --> 33:50.648
You two give the rest of us hope.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.209
- You okay?
- Yeah.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.963
About what you said in there to Cutter...

34:03.840 --> 34:06.286
Maybe we could meet up and talk about it.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.281
Tonight? Or...

34:08.639 --> 34:10.210
Not tonight.

34:10.679 --> 34:14.525
I think we're both exhausted
from whatever that was.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.880
Tomorrow?

34:17.400 --> 34:18.969
<i>"THEA". Hey, guys. Laurel just texted.</i>

34:19.480 --> 34:22.962
Guess Judge Sakow's holding court late.
And she's making her decision.

34:23.199 --> 34:26.841
I should probably change.
This outfit is a bit of a focus-puller.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.081
Mmm-hmm.

34:30.679 --> 34:33.922
Not for nothing, Oliver.
But I heard what Felicity said in there.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.844
No one likes an "I told you so", John.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.010
I'm just saying, she needs some time.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.368
Watch it. Could be a trap.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.081
They just left it behind?
Why would they do that?

35:05.400 --> 35:06.526
Drop the weapon.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.888
- Maybe you should radio Reiter.
- Why?

35:13.680 --> 35:15.091
Now we have guns, too.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.725
The standard of proof
for a preliminary hearing

35:20.920 --> 35:23.048
<i>is much less severe than one for a trial.</i>

35:23.240 --> 35:27.290
Even so, the evidence against
the defendant is exceedingly thin.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.881
There is no forensic
or circumstantial evidence

35:30.080 --> 35:32.208
that points to the defendant's guilt.

35:34.280 --> 35:39.081
<i>But I found Quentin Lance's testimony
to be particularly compelling.</i>

35:39.440 --> 35:43.081
<i>His credibility is bolstered
by his status as a police captain,</i>

35:43.320 --> 35:47.405
but the fact that he was willing to
incriminate himself to see justice done

35:47.560 --> 35:50.245
makes his testimony especially believable.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.484
<i>On the strength of it,</i>

35:52.720 --> 35:55.326
I am denying
the defense's motion to dismiss

35:55.560 --> 35:57.801
<i>and binding the defendant over for trial.</i>

35:58.240 --> 36:01.767
Mr. Darhk will be held without bail
or possibility of release.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.930
<i>"MAN". The defendant will rise.</i>

36:10.640 --> 36:13.450
<i>Officers, please escort the defendant
from the courtroom.</i>

36:22.120 --> 36:24.600
All right, next step.
Convicting the son of a bitch.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.125
Next step, right.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.841
Are we okay? I wasn't exactly
pulling punches on the stand.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.845
I'm glad you didn't. 'Cause of that,
Darhk's defense is blown to shreds.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.810
He's gonna spend the rest of his life
behind bars.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.288
Hey, Quentin. You have a minute?

36:37.480 --> 36:38.527
Yeah.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.968
Lieutenant Pike,
if I could just talk to you before...

36:41.160 --> 36:43.811
It's all right, sweetheart.
We both knew this was coming. Frank?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.651
You're being suspended
pending an l.A.B. investigation.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.885
I'll need your badge and your weapon.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.326
Yeah.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.565
I'm sorry about this, Quentin.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.130
I'm sure your union rep'll make it clear
to l.A.B.

36:58.360 --> 36:59.691
that you were acting under duress.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.121
Yeah, I'm good either way, Frank. Truly.

37:06.880 --> 37:10.646
It's a temporary setback.
I'll represent you in front of l.A.B.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.328
You just focus on nailing Darhk
to a cross, all right?

37:15.680 --> 37:17.011
I'm proud of you, baby.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.089
<i>We have the results
of the high-profile</i>

37:22.280 --> 37:24.521
<i>preliminary hearing against...</i>

37:24.760 --> 37:25.841
Hi.

37:26.640 --> 37:27.687
Hi.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.928
- Thought you'd be asleep by now.
- Oh, I can't sleep.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.765
What are you doing here?

37:36.200 --> 37:38.931
I just came to pick up a few things.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.322
It's not exactly
how I pictured our wedding day.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.767
I don't know.
Being kidnapped by psychotic criminals

37:46.960 --> 37:48.928
has sort of been a theme
in our relationship.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.842
I want you to know that...

38:02.040 --> 38:04.884
What I said today during the ceremony,

38:06.720 --> 38:08.848
I meant every single word of it.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.809
I love you.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.928
With everything in me.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.924
But what I said doesn't apply to us.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.929
I can't be with you. I can't marry you.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.009
Yes, you can.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.443
Yes, you can,
because that's what both of us want.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.325
You know, things can be different.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.891
I can be different.

38:36.160 --> 38:40.085
And I'm promising you,
I'm swearing to you,

38:42.240 --> 38:43.969
there will be no more lies.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.288
You know, no matter how much you love me,

38:50.640 --> 38:51.846
there's always gonna be a part of you

38:52.040 --> 38:55.283
that defaults to the man
who was on the island, alone.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.641
Who came back to save the city. Alone.

39:02.160 --> 39:06.131
And sooner than we both think,
you're going to be stuck in a situation

39:06.960 --> 39:11.284
where you have to make a decision that
requires you to hide things from me again.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.970
See, you can't know that...

39:13.200 --> 39:15.680
I do know that. And you know that.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.486
That's this life.

39:20.560 --> 39:21.561
I'm sorry.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.001
You know, five months ago,
I convinced you that we could have it all.

39:27.200 --> 39:31.524
We could come here to this job
and have each other, I was wrong.

39:33.640 --> 39:36.041
And then I thought we could just go back
to the way things were,

39:36.240 --> 39:38.720
before we left for Ivy Town.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.846
God, that was as crazy as Cupid is.

39:44.520 --> 39:45.760
So what does that mean?

39:47.840 --> 39:54.200
It means it is too hard to be here
with you every night and not be with you.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.521
That's not fair to either of us.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.001
You told me how you worked some tech magic

39:59.200 --> 40:01.771
to return all the money that Adam Hunt
swindled out of people.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.885
You don't need me. You'll be fine.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.041
You don't give up.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.890
You know, that's what makes you a hero.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.723
But there's no fixing this.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.284
We have to let each other go.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.405
I want you to keep it for good this time,
please.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.563
I don't wanna let you go.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.844
I don't wanna let you go.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.605
But I'm already gone.

42:20.800 --> 42:21.801
English - SDH
