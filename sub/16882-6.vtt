00:02.002 --> 00:03.003
>> THERAPIST: The key to any

00:03.037 --> 00:04.004
successful relationship is

00:04.038 --> 00:05.473
communication.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.474
What do you think is keeping the

00:06.507 --> 00:07.575
two of you from being able to

00:07.608 --> 00:10.078
fully trust each other?

00:11.745 --> 00:13.047
>> BECCA: Most of the time,

00:13.081 --> 00:14.182
things are good.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.683
But out of the blue, we'll have

00:15.716 --> 00:17.251
a minor disagreement.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.586
And then we're fighting for

00:18.619 --> 00:19.687
hours.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.688
>> THERAPIST: Vernon, what do

00:20.721 --> 00:21.689
you think about what Becca just

00:21.722 --> 00:22.723
said?

00:22.756 --> 00:23.724
>> VERNON: Pissed, dude.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.858
Bummed. It makes me feel like

00:24.892 --> 00:25.859
what the shit?

00:25.893 --> 00:26.860
She talks to me like I'm

00:26.894 --> 00:27.861
a child.

00:27.895 --> 00:28.862
>> BECCA: Because you are a

00:28.896 --> 00:29.863
child.

00:29.897 --> 00:30.864
>> VERNON: Oh, really?

00:30.898 --> 00:31.865
A child doctor, Becca?

00:31.899 --> 00:33.067
A child doctor with a BMW 7

00:33.101 --> 00:34.535
Series and a credit score well

00:34.568 --> 00:36.170
into the five hundos?

00:36.204 --> 00:37.505
>> BECCA: He almost got fired

00:37.538 --> 00:38.772
because, during a hip

00:38.806 --> 00:40.208
resurfacing, he took his

00:40.241 --> 00:41.509
sunglasses, put them on the

00:41.542 --> 00:42.676
patient's testicles and took a

00:42.710 --> 00:44.011
picture of it.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.012
>> THERAPIST: Very unpro...

00:45.045 --> 00:46.380
>> VERNON: Humor is a necessity

00:46.414 --> 00:47.881
in the operating room.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.183
Otherwise, we would collapse

00:49.217 --> 00:50.584
under the sheer weight of the

00:50.618 --> 00:51.685
human drama.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.686
>> THERAPIST: Guys? Right...

00:52.720 --> 00:53.687
>> BECCA: You fix tennis elbows

00:53.721 --> 00:54.688
for rich people!

00:54.722 --> 00:55.689
>> VERNON: Do not tell me how to

00:55.723 --> 00:56.690
do my calling!

00:56.724 --> 00:57.691
>> THERAPIST: Okay, guys, let's

00:57.725 --> 00:59.193
take a breath.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.028
And remember you're here because

01:01.061 --> 01:04.932
you love each other.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.201
There she is.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.570
Is it possible that the problem

01:09.603 --> 01:11.905
isn't between the two of you

01:11.939 --> 01:13.774
but rather in the negative

01:13.807 --> 01:15.143
external elements that are

01:15.176 --> 01:17.511
influencing your relationship?

01:24.618 --> 01:25.753
(Becca clears her throat)

01:25.786 --> 01:27.255
>> BECCA: So, our therapist said

01:27.288 --> 01:28.589
we need to cut out the toxic

01:28.622 --> 01:30.090
elements, which means we just

01:30.124 --> 01:31.825
can't have couples like you in

01:31.859 --> 01:33.261
our life anymore.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.895
>> GRETCHEN: Whoa!

01:34.928 --> 01:36.130
We're not a couple.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.431
We're just hanging out.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.766
>> JIMMY: Wait.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.767
Breakfast is still on you,

01:39.800 --> 01:40.768
right?

01:40.801 --> 01:41.802
>> VERNON: Yeah, totally.

01:41.835 --> 01:42.803
I gave them my card.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.104
It's a Chase Saph, which means

01:44.138 --> 01:45.306
when I use it at restaurants,

01:45.339 --> 01:46.640
I double-down on the points...

01:46.674 --> 01:48.142
>> BECCA: Anyway.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.244
Don't try to talk us out of it.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.213
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.284
>> BECCA: Well, good luck.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.285
Both of you.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.286
>> VERNON: So, I got an Xbox One

01:58.319 --> 01:59.287
if you ever want to dork out

01:59.320 --> 02:00.288
on some Madden.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.289
>> BECCA: Vernon?

02:01.322 --> 02:02.290
>> VERNON: I meant dork out

02:02.323 --> 02:03.291
online.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.292
We can't even headset-hang?

02:04.325 --> 02:05.293
>> BECCA: Will you please stop

02:05.326 --> 02:06.294
thinking about Madden for

02:06.327 --> 02:07.295
five seconds?

02:07.328 --> 02:08.296
>> GRETCHEN: What are you doing

02:08.329 --> 02:09.297
later?

02:09.330 --> 02:10.531
>> JIMMY: I am interviewing

02:10.564 --> 02:12.300
"Hollywood It Girl" Megan

02:12.333 --> 02:13.301
Thomas for Coterie magazine.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.502
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, she's hot.

02:14.535 --> 02:15.536
Send me pics.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.537
>> JIMMY: Nudes?

02:16.570 --> 02:17.538
(Gretchen laughs)

02:17.571 --> 02:18.606
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, okay, buddy.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.007
If you think you can get Megan

02:20.040 --> 02:21.942
Thomas naked, more power to you.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.177
>> JIMMY: Well, I was kidding.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.012
But as you said, "We're not a

02:25.045 --> 02:27.781
couple," so legally, I'm free to

02:27.815 --> 02:29.717
try, right?

02:29.750 --> 02:30.784
>> GRETCHEN: Did it bother you

02:30.818 --> 02:31.785
when I said that?

02:31.819 --> 02:32.853
>> JIMMY: No, no.

02:32.886 --> 02:33.854
It's important to set clear

02:33.887 --> 02:34.855
rules.

02:34.888 --> 02:35.889
Hey. This is on the curly

02:35.923 --> 02:37.157
ginger, yeah?

02:37.191 --> 02:38.492
All right, in that case, we'll

02:38.526 --> 02:39.793
take some things to go.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.061
Well, one of everything from the

02:41.094 --> 02:42.363
left side.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.364
Oh, and four of those souvenir

02:43.397 --> 02:44.365
T-shirts.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.366
>> GRETCHEN: Ooh, throw in a

02:45.399 --> 02:46.367
large child's.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.468
>> JIMMY: Hmm?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.469
>> GRETCHEN: Killian.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.438
>> JIMMY: Who?

02:57.845 --> 03:01.749
>> * I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:01.782 --> 03:04.084
I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:04.117 --> 03:07.187
Gonna leave you anyway. *

03:11.225 --> 03:12.025
>> JIMMY: Okay, so, um...

03:12.059 --> 03:13.026
(Megan laughs)

03:13.060 --> 03:14.027
>> JIMMY: ...how does one

03:14.061 --> 03:15.229
prepare for a role in which you

03:15.263 --> 03:16.397
play a... (laughs)

03:16.430 --> 03:17.831
Sorry.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.700
A tsunami widow?

03:19.733 --> 03:21.101
>> MEGAN: Shut up.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.603
Um, all right, this is the

03:22.636 --> 03:24.037
official quote.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.173
It was a singular pleasure to be

03:26.206 --> 03:28.075
able to bring a story of such

03:28.108 --> 03:29.843
courage to light.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.079
Plus, I did, like, six weeks of

03:32.112 --> 03:34.948
Haleo and CrossFit twice a day.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.318
Feel my calf, dude.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.725
>> JIMMY: That does indeed

03:44.758 --> 03:46.059
feel like the calf of a

03:46.093 --> 03:47.060
grieving widow.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.062
(Megan laughs)

03:50.898 --> 03:52.766
>> MEGAN: Whoa!

03:52.800 --> 03:54.468
You're a foot dude.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.604
>> JIMMY: No.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.871
Yes.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.106
>> MEGAN (laughing): You don't

03:59.139 --> 04:00.408
have to let go.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.375
Does your girlfriend have

04:01.409 --> 04:03.744
nice feet?

04:03.777 --> 04:04.712
>> JIMMY: Oh, she's not

04:04.745 --> 04:05.446
my girlfriend.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.380
In fact, earlier today, she said

04:06.414 --> 04:07.381
it straight out, "We are not

04:07.415 --> 04:08.382
a couple."

04:08.416 --> 04:09.383
>> MEGAN: Yeah, that's just

04:09.417 --> 04:10.384
something that girls say 'cause

04:10.418 --> 04:11.385
they feel like they have to.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.386
>> JIMMY: No, she's not like

04:12.420 --> 04:13.387
that at all.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.388
She's actually challenged me to

04:14.422 --> 04:15.389
try and get a...

04:15.423 --> 04:17.291
a nude photo of you.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.292
I mean, of course I told her

04:18.326 --> 04:19.993
that would be completely

04:20.027 --> 04:22.363
unprofessional.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.566
>> MEGAN: We should get another

04:25.599 --> 04:27.968
round.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.176
>> EDGAR: Perfect timing.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.177
I have great news.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.178
>> JIMMY: What-- you found your

04:38.211 --> 04:39.179
own place?

04:39.212 --> 04:40.314
>> EDGAR: My therapist said I

04:40.348 --> 04:41.449
should be alone as little as

04:41.482 --> 04:42.916
possible on account of how I've

04:42.950 --> 04:44.117
been waking up holding a knife.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.118
>> JIMMY: Mm.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.119
Wait, what?!

04:46.153 --> 04:47.120
>> EDGAR: Ah, it's not

04:47.154 --> 04:48.121
important.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.122
Anyway, the news was I made

04:49.156 --> 04:50.691
breakfast nachos.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.692
>> JIMMY: Go back to the knife

04:51.725 --> 04:52.693
thing.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.694
>> EDGAR: Not just breakfast

04:53.727 --> 04:54.962
nachos, breakfast nachos à la

04:54.995 --> 04:56.497
Jimmy and Gretchen with the

04:56.530 --> 04:57.931
peanuts on top because I know

04:57.965 --> 04:59.166
how Gretchen likes the crunch.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.668
>> MEGAN: Hey!

05:00.701 --> 05:02.503
I got to go, bud.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.537
>> JIMMY: I'll, uh, I'll walk

05:03.571 --> 05:05.339
you out.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.774
>> MEGAN: Mmm!

05:06.807 --> 05:09.276
(Megan speaking Spanish)

05:09.309 --> 05:11.645
Me gusta.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.149
>> LINDSAY: I can't believe

05:16.183 --> 05:17.184
Jimmy sent you naked photos of a

05:17.217 --> 05:18.719
celeb.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.720
>> GRETCHEN: I kind of dared him

05:19.753 --> 05:20.788
to.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.889
I didn't think he'd actually be

05:21.922 --> 05:22.890
able to hit that.

05:22.923 --> 05:23.891
>> LINDSAY: You have to break up

05:23.924 --> 05:25.225
with him-- big.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.060
Ooh, what if we spray-painted

05:27.094 --> 05:29.630
"pedophile" on his garage door?

05:29.663 --> 05:30.631
I did that when my neighbors

05:30.664 --> 05:31.632
left their Christmas lights up

05:31.665 --> 05:32.633
too long.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.634
>> GRETCHEN: I can't exactly be

05:33.667 --> 05:34.635
pissed off.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.636
I'm not his girlfriend.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.637
>> LINDSAY: Well, you at least

05:36.670 --> 05:37.638
have to sleep with someone else,

05:37.671 --> 05:38.639
too, or you'll resent him

05:38.672 --> 05:39.640
forever.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.974
That's feminism, Gretch.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.075
That's what Susan B. Anthony

05:42.109 --> 05:43.210
died for.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.211
>> GRETCHEN: Do you even know

05:44.244 --> 05:45.212
who Susan B. Anthony is?

05:45.245 --> 05:46.213
>> LINDSAY: She made an airplane

05:46.246 --> 05:47.214
disappear.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.215
>> GRETCHEN: Nope. What?

05:48.248 --> 05:49.216
That's Amelia Earhart.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.217
And she didn't make an air...

05:50.250 --> 05:51.218
>> LINDSAY: Whatever, history.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.219
You happened already.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.387
Let it go.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.388
>> GRETCHEN: I'm not gonna have

05:54.422 --> 05:55.389
sex with some stranger.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.390
>> LINDSAY: What about that

05:56.424 --> 05:57.391
barista with the giant hog you

05:57.425 --> 05:58.392
dated?

05:58.426 --> 05:59.393
>> GRETCHEN: Venti?

05:59.427 --> 06:00.394
The size barely made up for the

06:00.428 --> 06:01.328
fact that his moustache was

06:01.361 --> 06:02.763
connected to his sideburns.

06:02.796 --> 06:03.831
It was like getting banged by

06:03.864 --> 06:04.998
John Quincy Adams.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.066
>> LINDSAY: Exactly.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.001
America's first black astronaut.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.903
>> GRETCHEN: I'm so glad you

06:09.937 --> 06:11.171
don't have a job.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.541
>> LINDSAY: Right?

06:17.478 --> 06:18.679
>> VENTI: Gretchen?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.247
Oh, my God. Long time.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.449
>> GRETCHEN: I know.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.250
You're still working here.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.618
>> VENTI: Yeah!

06:24.652 --> 06:26.186
>> GRETCHEN: How is your band?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.788
>> VENTI: Oh, our drummer was

06:27.821 --> 06:29.557
scuba diving in Cancun and

06:29.590 --> 06:30.958
somehow went deaf.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.626
So if you know any drummers...

06:32.660 --> 06:34.061
>> GRETCHEN: I will keep my ear

06:34.094 --> 06:35.195
out.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.797
(both laugh)

06:36.830 --> 06:38.432
Do you still have your van?

06:38.466 --> 06:39.433
>> VENTI: Yeah.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.434
>> GRETCHEN: Meet me there in

06:40.468 --> 06:41.435
five.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.703
>> VENTI: Oh, I wish I could.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.404
But I'm a manager now and if I

06:44.438 --> 06:45.773
abandon my post, my boss will

06:45.806 --> 06:48.175
fire me.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.628
>> JIMMY: Hey.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.630
>> GRETCHEN: Hi.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.239
Congrats on the photos.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.608
Megan Thomas-- bringing back the

07:20.641 --> 07:22.109
bush.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.143
>> JIMMY: It was for a grieving

07:23.176 --> 07:24.578
widow role.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.079
You're not mad, are you?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.515
>> GRETCHEN: No.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.249
Like you said, it was totally

07:29.282 --> 07:31.284
legal for you to do that.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.285
>> JIMMY: Because we're not

07:32.319 --> 07:33.286
a couple.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.121
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.756
We're just two chill people,

07:35.789 --> 07:39.760
being totally cool about stuff.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.496
You can have sex with celebs, I

07:42.530 --> 07:45.833
can bang an ex... which I did...

07:45.866 --> 07:47.267
Which is great.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.602
Because now we're even.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.170
>> JIMMY: Sorry, you did what?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.171
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.940
I ran into that barista from

07:52.973 --> 07:54.141
Silver Lake Coffee.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.776
>> JIMMY: Who, Grande?

07:55.809 --> 07:56.777
>> GRETCHEN: Yes, that was his

07:56.810 --> 07:57.778
nickname.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.179
You're not mad, are you?

07:59.212 --> 08:00.013
>> JIMMY: Pfft.

08:00.047 --> 08:00.848
Of course not.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.850
I'm just confused, because you

08:02.883 --> 08:05.953
just used the word "even."

08:05.986 --> 08:08.121
Because, technically, I slept

08:08.155 --> 08:09.456
with a sexy, famous celebrity

08:09.489 --> 08:10.891
I'd just met, while you just

08:10.924 --> 08:12.726
re-banged a barista.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.727
So that doesn't really count as

08:13.761 --> 08:15.062
a full person, does it?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.997
He's, like, half a person.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.031
At best.

08:18.065 --> 08:18.999
>> GRETCHEN: Didn't feel like

08:19.032 --> 08:20.400
half a person.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.401
>> JIMMY: And I've just

08:21.434 --> 08:22.870
remembered his nickname: Venti.

08:22.903 --> 08:23.837
>> GRETCHEN: I didn't want to

08:23.871 --> 08:24.471
rub it in.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.338
>> JIMMY: Nothing to rub in.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.674
In no world does Hollywood It

08:26.707 --> 08:28.676
Girl Megan Thomas equal your

08:28.709 --> 08:30.243
chai wallah.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.845
But hey, by all means, let's

08:31.879 --> 08:33.847
call it "even."

08:35.616 --> 08:36.817
Where you going?

08:36.850 --> 08:37.985
>> GRETCHEN: I have stuff to do!

08:38.018 --> 08:39.419
(door slams)

08:45.793 --> 08:46.694
>> ANNOUNCER: Ron Stitches

08:46.727 --> 08:47.360
Show...

08:47.394 --> 08:49.329
(phone rings, explosion booms)

08:49.362 --> 08:50.363
>> RON: Welcome back to The

08:50.397 --> 08:51.732
Ron Stitches Show.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.333
I'm Ron and we've got Edgar in

08:53.366 --> 08:54.501
Los Angeles, who says his

08:54.534 --> 08:55.669
roommate's sex life is causing

08:55.703 --> 08:57.070
him problems.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.171
What's the deal, Edgar?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.240
>> EDGAR: Well, Ron, I'm kind of

09:00.273 --> 09:01.709
in a moral dilemma.

09:01.742 --> 09:02.576
>> RON: A moral dilemma or an

09:02.610 --> 09:04.077
oral dilemma?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.112
>> WOMAN (sultry): Oh, yes...

09:05.145 --> 09:06.546
>> EDGAR: Ooh, now, the thing is

09:06.580 --> 09:07.380
I really like my roommate's

09:07.414 --> 09:08.215
girlfriend.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.216
>> RON: And you plan on hittin'

09:09.249 --> 09:10.083
that, right?

09:10.117 --> 09:11.218
>> WOMAN: Oh, yes...!

09:11.251 --> 09:12.219
>> EDGAR: No.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.053
No, no, no, no.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.888
I-I mean as a person.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.557
I really want them to work out.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.559
The thing is... he slept with

09:19.593 --> 09:22.262
someone else, and... I don't

09:22.295 --> 09:23.396
know if I should tell her or

09:23.430 --> 09:24.397
not.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.232
>> RON: Whoa, whoa, what?

09:25.265 --> 09:26.399
Rat out your bro, bro?

09:26.433 --> 09:27.567
Is this a prank call?

09:27.601 --> 09:28.535
Cheryl, you're screening these

09:28.568 --> 09:29.402
calls, right?

09:29.436 --> 09:30.237
Or are you just sitting over

09:30.270 --> 09:31.104
there playing with them big old

09:31.138 --> 09:31.939
hooters of yours?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.607
(owl hoots, woman moans)

09:33.641 --> 09:34.608
>> EDGAR: It's just that ever

09:34.642 --> 09:36.543
since I came back from Iraq, I

09:36.576 --> 09:37.911
haven't really met many people I

09:37.945 --> 09:40.247
can talk to... and she listens.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.248
>> RON: First off, I'd like to

09:41.281 --> 09:42.382
say thank you for you service,

09:42.415 --> 09:43.250
soldier.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.251
If I didn't have this God-dang

09:44.284 --> 09:45.252
bee allergy, I would have been

09:45.285 --> 09:46.419
right over there with you.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.254
So talk to me.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.555
You ever shoot that .50 cal?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.257
I shot one in Vegas one time.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.291
It was hell, man.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.960
I got separated from my squad

09:52.993 --> 09:54.928
somewhere between Crazy Girls

09:54.962 --> 09:56.196
and the Spearmint Rhino and...

09:58.465 --> 09:59.599
>> LINDSAY: Actually, he's

09:59.633 --> 10:00.433
right.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.101
>> GRETCHEN: Linds!

10:01.134 --> 10:01.935
>> LINDSAY: Think about it.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.737
Megan Thomas is a major score.

10:03.771 --> 10:04.571
She's, like, totally

10:04.604 --> 10:05.405
Hollywood's...

10:05.438 --> 10:06.239
>> GRETCHEN: Don't say

10:06.273 --> 10:07.074
"Hollywood's It Girl."

10:07.107 --> 10:07.908
>> LINDSAY: She is.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.276
And Venti is old news.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.478
He's previously taken dick.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.146
PTD, if you will.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.148
>> GRETCHEN: PTD.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.950
Okay, so what if there's a guy

10:16.984 --> 10:18.485
that I haven't...

10:18.518 --> 10:21.755
taken, but I did maybe...

10:21.789 --> 10:22.956
>> LINDSAY: Slob on it?

10:22.990 --> 10:23.924
Still wouldn't count.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.425
You've got to rule out

10:25.458 --> 10:27.327
previously taken or sucked

10:27.360 --> 10:29.797
dicks-- PTSD.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.798
>> GRETCHEN: That's what Edgar

10:30.831 --> 10:31.631
has.

10:31.665 --> 10:32.800
(both laughing)

10:32.833 --> 10:34.434
>> BOTH: Aw...

10:34.467 --> 10:35.468
>> LINDSAY: PTSDs are half a

10:35.502 --> 10:36.303
point.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.304
Kind of like how a competitive

10:37.337 --> 10:38.171
bird watcher only gets points

10:38.205 --> 10:38.972
when he sees a new species he

10:39.006 --> 10:39.940
hasn't.

10:39.973 --> 10:40.774
>> GRETCHEN: Paul does

10:40.808 --> 10:41.608
competitive bird watching?

10:41.641 --> 10:42.609
>> LINDSAY: I don't want to talk

10:42.642 --> 10:43.443
about it.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.277
>> GRETCHEN: Whatever.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.278
The whole thing's stupid.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.479
>> LINDSAY: So finish it!

10:46.513 --> 10:47.681
The sooner you put someone

10:47.715 --> 10:49.482
behind you, the sooner you can

10:49.516 --> 10:51.819
put this behind you.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.024
>> GRETCHEN: Wow, Denver.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.025
I've never met anyone who makes

10:58.058 --> 10:59.659
their own furniture before.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.561
That canopy bed sounds amazing.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.831
I would love to check it out

11:03.864 --> 11:04.664
sometime.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.632
>> DENVER: Well, finish up that

11:05.665 --> 11:08.001
drink and I'll show it to you.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.140
You see this headboard?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.842
It's all salvaged wood!

11:14.875 --> 11:16.009
Took me three months to

11:16.043 --> 11:16.844
refurbish the hull of a Nova

11:16.877 --> 11:20.513
Scotian haddock trawler.

11:20.547 --> 11:23.216
>> ACTOR: I mean, as a black

11:23.250 --> 11:25.018
actor, you're talking drug

11:25.052 --> 11:27.187
dealer, athlete, judge... or

11:27.220 --> 11:28.688
sometimes God, if you're old.

11:28.722 --> 11:29.857
Do you know how many McDonald's

11:29.890 --> 11:30.991
commercials I've been in as a

11:31.024 --> 11:32.359
black actor?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.226
I can hear that damn jingle in

11:33.260 --> 11:34.361
my sleep.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.996
I'm n lovin' it.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.064
They lovin' it.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.065
>> GRETCHEN: Don't you think,

11:38.098 --> 11:39.199
now that 12 Years a Slave has

11:39.232 --> 11:40.200
won Best Picture...

11:40.233 --> 11:41.368
>> ACTOR: Man, y'all white

11:41.401 --> 11:42.369
people love slavery movies even

11:42.402 --> 11:43.436
more than you loved actual

11:43.470 --> 11:44.437
slavery.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.206
As a black actor...

11:46.239 --> 11:47.507
>> GRETCHEN: So there I am, at

11:47.540 --> 11:48.541
the after-party for Danny

11:48.575 --> 11:50.043
Brown's latest album, and I'm in

11:50.077 --> 11:51.378
this house in the hills, no idea

11:51.411 --> 11:52.579
where I am, and I look at a

11:52.612 --> 11:53.881
picture on the wall and I

11:53.914 --> 11:56.884
realize it's Diana Ross.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.887
I am at Diana Ross's house.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.688
So I go to the bathroom, I grab

12:01.721 --> 12:02.756
a hairbrush...

12:02.790 --> 12:04.391
(man screams)

12:04.424 --> 12:05.392
>> MAN: Yes!

12:05.425 --> 12:06.393
(men cheering)

12:06.426 --> 12:07.427
>> MAN 2: That's what I'm

12:07.460 --> 12:08.261
talking about!

12:08.295 --> 12:09.763
(men whooping)

12:09.797 --> 12:12.065
>> AIDEN: Well, I'd really like

12:12.099 --> 12:13.100
to try to get into writing

12:13.133 --> 12:14.567
movies and teleplays, but

12:14.601 --> 12:15.903
honestly, I'd be happy anywhere

12:15.936 --> 12:17.037
in... (laughs)

12:17.070 --> 12:18.105
I'd call it "the biz," but I

12:18.138 --> 12:19.406
just moved out here from Ohio

12:19.439 --> 12:22.275
in the family minivan...

12:22.309 --> 12:23.276
But...

12:23.310 --> 12:25.045
>> GRETCHEN: And I'm out.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.247
>> LINDSAY: Wait!

12:27.280 --> 12:28.248
Why don't you go get us two

12:28.281 --> 12:30.417
more?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.287
>> GRETCHEN: It's so awful we

12:34.321 --> 12:35.722
have to feel any of this.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.058
Lust, love...

12:38.091 --> 12:39.259
Don't we have bigger problems to

12:39.292 --> 12:40.760
worry about?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.295
I am in a bar, trolling for

12:42.329 --> 12:43.730
dudes, just to prove

12:43.763 --> 12:45.065
something-- to who?

12:45.098 --> 12:45.899
To Darwin?

12:45.933 --> 12:46.934
To myself?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.435
It is embarrassing and beneath

12:48.468 --> 12:50.770
us is what I am saying.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.439
You know?

12:52.472 --> 12:53.974
>> BOUNCER: Not really.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.442
But I will say, if this Darwin

12:55.475 --> 12:56.609
clown is not treating you

12:56.643 --> 12:59.246
properly...

12:59.279 --> 13:02.149
he's a goddamn fool.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.150
>> LINDSAY: I mean, sure, he

13:03.183 --> 13:04.985
sleeps in flannel pajamas with

13:05.018 --> 13:07.320
socks, and yes, he spends six

13:07.354 --> 13:09.156
weeks of every summer at a magic

13:09.189 --> 13:10.790
camp for adults and...

13:10.824 --> 13:12.492
Okay, he has an allergy to soap

13:12.525 --> 13:13.793
and we have to buy him that

13:13.827 --> 13:16.763
special oil for dogs... but he's

13:16.796 --> 13:18.331
my husband.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.766
And he doesn't deserve for

13:19.799 --> 13:22.469
anybody to be mean to him.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.104
Ever.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.472
>> AIDEN: How could anyone not

13:25.505 --> 13:26.639
like Paul?

13:26.673 --> 13:28.641
>> LINDSAY: I know!

13:28.675 --> 13:30.643
Paul.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.083
(Lindsay gasping, moaning)

13:39.686 --> 13:41.188
>> LINDSAY: You like that?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.190
>> AIDEN: I don't know.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.094
(Bouncer grunting passionately)

13:49.362 --> 13:50.497
>> GRETCHEN: Wait.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.664
Move me, like, six inches right.

13:51.698 --> 13:52.499
My face is way too near that

13:52.532 --> 13:54.501
booger.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.440
(Lindsay gasping)

14:17.891 --> 14:19.359
(Edgar knocks on door)

14:19.392 --> 14:20.393
>> EDGAR: Hello, Padre.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.529
>> PRIEST: Hello.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.233
>> EDGAR: I have a dilemma.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.702
I... I know this secret, and I

14:29.736 --> 14:31.371
can't decide if I should tell.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.705
If I do, a lot of people could

14:32.739 --> 14:33.907
get hurt.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.075
>> PRIEST: Son, your situation

14:35.108 --> 14:36.776
reminds me of a sermon I just

14:36.809 --> 14:37.777
delivered.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.079
I related Paul's Letter to the

14:39.112 --> 14:40.247
Corinthians to individual

14:40.280 --> 14:41.514
moral responsibility.

14:41.548 --> 14:45.518
What I said was...

14:45.552 --> 14:47.520
Wait, how did I put it?

14:47.554 --> 14:48.922
I said it so good.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.057
Terry was there.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.558
Terry!

14:51.591 --> 14:52.392
Damn it.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.694
Has anybody seen Terry?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.029
No?

14:56.063 --> 14:56.896
(priest sighs)

14:56.930 --> 14:58.265
Anyway, the gist of it was

14:58.298 --> 14:59.199
listen to your own conscience,

14:59.232 --> 15:00.200
but at the same time, don't do

15:00.233 --> 15:01.534
anything that could cause harm.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.535
>> EDGAR: Oh, well, it's just

15:02.569 --> 15:04.737
that if I sit on this, it could

15:04.771 --> 15:07.407
get even worse.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.408
>> PRIEST: What is the nature of

15:08.441 --> 15:09.442
this information?

15:09.476 --> 15:10.410
>> EDGAR: I've said too much

15:10.443 --> 15:11.411
already.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.579
Thanks.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.948
I know what I have to do.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.095
>> PRIEST: Yeah, it's me.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.262
I think we got another Snowden

15:29.296 --> 15:30.730
on our hands.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.900
(phone buzzing)

15:33.933 --> 15:34.734
>> JIMMY: Hello.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.735
>> GRETCHEN: Can't talk long.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.736
I just wanted to tell you we're

15:36.769 --> 15:37.570
even.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.638
>> JIMMY: What, Venti again?

15:38.671 --> 15:39.606
>> GRETCHEN: Nope.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.607
We've both slept with someone

15:40.640 --> 15:41.608
new, which makes us even.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.310
So, yay us.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.777
>> JIMMY: Wait, that's not even.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.613
My person was a stranger, which

15:46.646 --> 15:47.814
was one point, your person was

15:47.847 --> 15:50.117
Venti, which was worth a half,

15:50.150 --> 15:51.484
so I was one-half up on you.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.320
But now with this new person,

15:53.353 --> 15:54.754
you're one-half up on me.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.256
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, my God, Jimmy.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.324
Who cares?

15:57.357 --> 15:58.325
Can't we just call it a draw?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.326
>> JIMMY: Well, that's easy for

15:59.359 --> 16:01.261
you to say, you're one-half up.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.662
Now I have to sleep with an ex.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.431
(Gretchen laughs)

16:04.464 --> 16:06.433
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, okay.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.334
Good luck with that.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.168
Anyway, I gotta go.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.102
Some work thing.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.271
Bye.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.139
>> BRIANNA: Um, do you have a

16:12.172 --> 16:12.972
work thing?

16:13.006 --> 16:13.973
Because I don't have anything on

16:14.007 --> 16:14.807
your calendar.

16:14.841 --> 16:15.642
>> GRETCHEN: Hurry up.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.643
You're letting all the cold air

16:16.676 --> 16:18.645
out.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.347
>> BECCA: Well, I hope you're

16:54.381 --> 16:56.716
here to repay the $300 you guys

16:56.749 --> 16:58.385
somehow spent at breakfast.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.386
>> JIMMY: Why does everyone hate

16:59.419 --> 17:00.553
me?

17:00.587 --> 17:01.854
I know it's weird to ask you--

17:01.888 --> 17:03.490
you rightfully hate my guts.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.358
But... but what's wrong with me

17:05.392 --> 17:06.526
that I can't sustain a single

17:06.559 --> 17:07.860
relationship?

17:07.894 --> 17:09.329
>> BECCA: Oh...

17:09.362 --> 17:12.232
I hate emotional Jimmy.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.234
Come in.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.406
>> JIMMY: Everyone I care about

17:19.439 --> 17:21.074
ends up hating me.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.375
Why is that?

17:22.409 --> 17:23.710
>> BECCA: Oh, because you're

17:23.743 --> 17:25.545
a narcissist with face-blindness

17:25.578 --> 17:26.379
who, without hesitation or

17:26.413 --> 17:27.714
consequence, uses people to get

17:27.747 --> 17:28.715
what you want.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.716
>> JIMMY: God, you know me so

17:29.749 --> 17:31.851
well.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.685
>> BECCA: Can I have one of

17:32.719 --> 17:33.520
those?

17:33.553 --> 17:34.387
>> JIMMY: They're pretty

17:34.421 --> 17:35.021
expensive.

17:35.054 --> 17:35.622
>> BECCA: I know.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.523
I used to buy them for you

17:36.556 --> 17:38.525
all the time.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.927
Shut up and give me one.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.729
>> JIMMY: So, um... where's

17:42.762 --> 17:44.431
Vernon?

17:44.464 --> 17:45.898
>> BECCA: You just missed him.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.400
He left to go do his rotation,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.736
or as he calls it, his

17:49.769 --> 17:50.570
"rotaish."

17:50.603 --> 17:51.738
>> JIMMY: Oh.

17:51.771 --> 17:52.739
I didn't know he did night

17:52.772 --> 17:54.741
"rotaishes."

17:58.478 --> 17:59.612
>> BECCA: Oh, my God!

17:59.646 --> 18:01.281
Jimmy, what the hell!

18:01.314 --> 18:02.449
>> JIMMY: Oops.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.618
Sorry.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.553
Should... should I go?

18:06.586 --> 18:07.554
>> BECCA: Yes!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.522
Obviously.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.406
>> JIMMY: Oh, I forgot to

18:26.439 --> 18:27.407
mention: we're even.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.441
It's one and a half to

18:28.475 --> 18:29.276
one and a half.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.743
I bagged an ex.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.279
>> GRETCHEN: Ah.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.780
Who was she?

18:33.813 --> 18:34.947
>> JIMMY: Just this girl...

18:34.981 --> 18:36.115
Hillary.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.116
You don't know her.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.753
Unmemorable, but... pliant.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.988
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, great.

18:42.021 --> 18:45.825
So... we are even.

18:45.858 --> 18:46.659
>> JIMMY: Are you mad?

18:46.693 --> 18:47.794
>> GRETCHEN: No.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.796
Why would I be mad?

18:49.829 --> 18:51.331
It's all good, brah.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.265
>> JIMMY: Why are you talking

18:52.299 --> 18:53.266
like Guy Fieri?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.267
>> GRETCHEN: 'Cause, Jimmy, you

18:54.301 --> 18:55.335
don't really want to know what's

18:55.368 --> 18:56.269
on my mind.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.270
That's not what this is.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.339
We are just two independently

18:59.372 --> 19:00.973
existing people who get together

19:01.007 --> 19:02.642
to have sex.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.810
>> JIMMY: Well, how do I

19:03.843 --> 19:05.478
determine what we are?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.513
You're the one who started this

19:06.546 --> 19:07.814
whole thing when you said...

19:07.847 --> 19:08.815
>> GRETCHEN: "Said?"

19:08.848 --> 19:10.483
You're the one who did, Jimmy.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.019
You did goddamn Hollywood It

19:13.052 --> 19:14.020
Girl Megan Thomas.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.021
>> JIMMY: Only because you said

19:15.054 --> 19:15.855
I could!

19:15.888 --> 19:16.789
>> GRETCHEN: And then I sleep

19:16.823 --> 19:17.990
with one guy and you freak out!

19:18.024 --> 19:18.958
>> JIMMY: It was one and a half

19:18.991 --> 19:20.993
guys!

19:21.027 --> 19:22.829
>> GRETCHEN: So you are jealous.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.331
Why don't you just admit you

19:24.364 --> 19:25.332
can't handle it if I sleep with

19:25.365 --> 19:26.333
someone else?

19:26.366 --> 19:27.467
>> JIMMY: Fine, if you admit

19:27.500 --> 19:28.501
that you can't handle it if I

19:28.535 --> 19:29.502
do.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.003
>> GRETCHEN: Fine!

19:31.037 --> 19:32.171
(sarcastic): Well, then maybe we

19:32.205 --> 19:33.706
should be "exclusive."

19:33.740 --> 19:34.541
Is that what you want?

19:34.574 --> 19:35.508
>> JIMMY (sarcastic): Ooh, yeah,

19:35.542 --> 19:36.343
that'd be awesome.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.210
Let's do that.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.511
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, great.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.379
>> JIMMY: Great.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.381
Guess we're "exclusive," then.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.652
>> GRETCHEN: Wait.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.686
Are we being sarcastic or are we

19:46.719 --> 19:47.687
actually exclusive?

19:47.720 --> 19:48.521
>> JIMMY: I got a little bit

19:48.555 --> 19:50.022
lost in there somewhere.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.360
But yeah... I guess we're...

19:53.393 --> 19:54.894
exclusive.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.496
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.864
Cool.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.866
>> JIMMY: Cool.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.872
>> GRETCHEN: Can you believe

20:05.905 --> 20:07.073
Becca and Vernon said we were

20:07.106 --> 20:08.074
toxic?

20:08.107 --> 20:08.908
>> JIMMY: Yeah, no kidding.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.510
What a joke.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.011
(pop intro playing)

20:12.044 --> 20:15.982
(no voice)

20:19.252 --> 20:21.721
>> * Oh, oh, oh, oh...

20:21.754 --> 20:24.223
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

20:24.257 --> 20:26.959
Oh, oh, oh, oh

20:26.993 --> 20:28.728
* Oh, oh, oh, oh...

20:28.761 --> 20:30.897
Sun on its cycle

20:30.930 --> 20:33.733
Don't carry it away

20:33.766 --> 20:38.571
* All light within it changes

20:38.605 --> 20:41.240
Only the sun

20:41.274 --> 20:43.710
Needs rearranging

20:43.743 --> 20:46.646
* Darling, there's hardly

20:46.679 --> 20:47.614
Anything

20:47.647 --> 20:51.050
Burning faster for you

20:51.083 --> 20:54.086
* You say, "Don't go, oh-oh"

20:54.120 --> 20:55.054
>> WOMAN: Let go...

20:55.087 --> 20:57.390
>> * Don't go

20:57.424 --> 20:59.459
Everything close

20:59.492 --> 21:01.060
Oh, but you know

21:01.093 --> 21:04.230
* Oh, let it go

21:04.263 --> 21:07.133
Darling, there's more than

21:07.166 --> 21:11.137
Anything burning faster for you

21:11.170 --> 21:15.975
* You'll say, "Don't go, oh-oh"

21:23.115 --> 21:26.953
* Don't go, oh-oh...

21:26.986 --> 21:30.957
Farewell, she knew ya... *

21:43.002 --> 21:44.604
(knocking on door)

21:44.637 --> 21:45.838
>> GRETCHEN: Come in.

21:45.872 --> 21:46.839
>> EDGAR: I know this isn't a

21:46.873 --> 21:48.140
great time, but there's

21:48.174 --> 21:49.809
something I have to say.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.644
Gretchen, this is going to upset

21:51.678 --> 21:54.614
you, and, Jimmy... you're going

21:54.647 --> 21:56.282
to hate me for ratting, but--

21:56.315 --> 21:57.283
>> JIMMY: Edgar, we're not doing

21:57.316 --> 21:59.251
anything!

22:01.988 --> 22:02.955
>> GRETCHEN: What's the awful

22:02.989 --> 22:05.191
news, Edgar?

22:05.224 --> 22:06.325
>> EDGAR: Uh, just that...

22:06.359 --> 22:09.161
I was making you guys nachos

22:09.195 --> 22:10.863
à la Jimmy and Gretchen, and it

22:10.897 --> 22:12.365
turns out we're out of peanuts.

22:12.399 --> 22:13.666
>> JIMMY: So...?

22:13.700 --> 22:15.868
Make them without the peanuts.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.303
>> EDGAR: Okay.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.005
I will.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.842
Oh, and, uh... you're welcome.

22:22.875 --> 22:23.676
>> GRETCHEN: For the nachos?

22:23.710 --> 22:25.044
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.680
For the nachos.
