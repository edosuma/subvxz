00:04.738 --> 00:05.572
Barbara and Eddie Smith.

00:05.638 --> 00:07.240
My mum and dad.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.309
We could go through there
into another time.

00:09.376 --> 00:12.712
It's only dangerous
to go back in time
if you change something.

00:12.779 --> 00:13.880
And you're not going to.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.515
Where are Sarah Jane and Luke?

00:15.582 --> 00:17.517
LUKE: <i>1951.</i>
SARAH JANE: <i>It's her, my mum.</i>

00:17.584 --> 00:18.585
Eddie Smith.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.487
SARAH JANE: August the 18th.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.021
It's the day they died.

00:22.088 --> 00:24.791
I could save
them with the sonic.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.327
TRICKSTER: <i>It's happening.</i>

00:27.394 --> 00:29.829
Time for me
to collect my prize.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.631
I don't like this at all!

00:31.698 --> 00:34.567
(LAUGHING)

00:34.634 --> 00:36.369
What's happened?

00:36.436 --> 00:37.871
I'm going through.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.641
(PANTING)

00:41.708 --> 00:43.877
(BOTH SCREAMING)

00:46.146 --> 00:49.315
LUKE: <i>This is our time.</i>
<i>Our world.</i>

00:49.382 --> 00:50.984
(SCREAMING)

00:51.050 --> 00:55.755
You gave this
planet to the Trickster.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.757
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

01:09.702 --> 01:16.876
You gave me what I wanted
all those years ago in 1951.

01:16.943 --> 01:20.780
You're lying.
How could me saving
my mum and dad do all of this?

01:20.847 --> 01:23.082
They're just two
ordinary people!

01:23.149 --> 01:27.353
This place is a weak point
on the web of time.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.789
In the grand
scheme of things, yes,

01:29.856 --> 01:32.926
you saving your parents
was a tiny thing.

01:32.992 --> 01:38.431
But the village is on the
fault line and you smashed
right through it.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.568
Time was broken open.

01:41.634 --> 01:45.672
I existed only in
the limbo dimensions.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.907
I could only
walk in the shadows,

01:47.974 --> 01:52.612
appear only in your reality
for fleeting moments.

01:52.679 --> 01:56.382
But you gave me
a path into this world.

01:56.449 --> 02:00.954
I exist here,
in the flesh, forever!

02:01.020 --> 02:03.623
I've defeated you before.
I can do it again.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.426
We're going back. To 1951!

02:06.493 --> 02:10.930
Do you not understand?
The battle is over.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.466
You've already lost.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.870
-(EVIL LAUGHTER)
-Mum, come on!

02:20.340 --> 02:25.245
-RANI: I don't get it.
-This is Earth, 21st century.
Right now.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.547
It's an alternative timeline.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.582
The box protected us,
like it protected Maria

02:29.649 --> 02:33.052
the last time the Trickster
appeared, when the world
changed around her.

02:33.119 --> 02:35.989
This is Earth today?

02:36.055 --> 02:39.459
Yep. And this is all
that's left of London.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.429
-RANI: Where are
all the people?
-Gone.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.732
-(THUNDERCLAP)
-SARAH JANE: It's all
my fault!

02:45.798 --> 02:48.401
All we have to do to change
things back is repair the car!

02:48.468 --> 02:50.403
And then what? I order my
mother and father inside,

02:50.470 --> 02:52.305
-and send them off
to their deaths?
-It's the only way.

02:52.372 --> 02:56.676
I can't do it.
If it was me, Luke,
could you? I won't kill them!

02:56.743 --> 03:00.680
There must be another way.
There's always another way!

03:00.747 --> 03:03.283
(THUNDER BOOMING)

03:03.349 --> 03:05.985
Negative energy readings
coming from the village.

03:06.052 --> 03:08.521
He's breaking through
somewhere down there.

03:08.588 --> 03:11.758
-It's so cold.
-(THUNDER BOOMS)

03:15.328 --> 03:18.731
That's not natural.
It's starting,
he's coming through!

03:25.738 --> 03:28.107
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

03:28.174 --> 03:29.842
-Looks like rain.
-Yeah.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.912
Astonishing how it's turned.

03:32.979 --> 03:36.149
Right. Everybody inside!
Come on!

03:36.215 --> 03:40.353
Look lively!
Into the village hall!
Come on!

03:40.420 --> 03:44.557
I've never seen it turn so bad
so quickly. It's creepy.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.126
Come on,
love, let's get inside.

03:47.193 --> 03:50.663
MRS KING: Chop-chop!
Everybody into the hall.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.769
RANI: Are you okay?

03:56.836 --> 04:00.440
I've been chased by Slitheen.
I've been aboard a spaceship.

04:00.506 --> 04:03.743
I've had
a Sontaran shooting at me.

04:03.810 --> 04:09.682
I always thought,
I don't know,
"All in a day's work."

04:09.749 --> 04:12.151
'Cause it was scary
and brilliant all
at the same time.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.420
Yeah, that's what I feel.

04:14.487 --> 04:18.558
But this is different.
We're in
an alternative timeline.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.629
Our world never existed.
So how do we get
back home from here?

04:22.695 --> 04:24.864
We keep walking.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.033
CLYDE: Look!

04:29.369 --> 04:30.703
(GRUNTING)

04:32.305 --> 04:35.008
He's got to be on
his way somewhere.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.644
I can't get
an exact fix on him.

04:37.710 --> 04:42.382
He's here somewhere. I'm lost.
We saw
the Trickster in the future.

04:42.448 --> 04:46.452
But he hasn't manifested
himself yet. That's about
to happen here, in 1951.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.721
If we can find him,
perhaps we can still stop him.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.024
But how? What's the other way?
How can we stop him?

04:51.090 --> 04:52.959
I don't know. Yet.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.595
There's only one
person in the universe
who would know straightaway.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.130
One person who could help us.

04:57.196 --> 04:58.631
And where is he
whenever you need him?

05:00.933 --> 05:06.172
Oh, yes!
Yes! I don't believe it!

05:06.239 --> 05:11.010
Doctor! It's me! Doctor!

05:11.077 --> 05:15.281
Won't find
a doctor in here, my love.
What do you want?

05:15.348 --> 05:18.117
Nothing. Sorry, Officer.

05:18.184 --> 05:21.087
It's just a police box.
What the TARDIS looks like.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.922
They were everywhere
in this time period.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.793
That's as may be,
but if you don't mind,
missus...

05:26.859 --> 05:29.362
(DOOR CLOSING)

05:29.429 --> 05:31.497
We could do this ourselves.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.368
(PANTING)

05:35.435 --> 05:38.604
Why is he still running round?
There's nothing here.

05:38.671 --> 05:43.209
Yeah.
What does he want with Earth
when it's in this state?

05:43.276 --> 05:45.378
(MACHINERY WHIRRING)

Slowly.

05:54.754 --> 05:58.124
Humans, stop! Humans, rest!

05:58.191 --> 06:00.226
They're slaves.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.596
Oh, no. No, Clyde.
Tell me that's not her. Mum!

06:03.663 --> 06:06.432
Stay back! He's seen us!

06:09.102 --> 06:11.037
Deviants.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.874
You don't belong.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.846
He's scared of us!

06:19.912 --> 06:22.148
-That's my mum!
-Stop, Rani!

06:22.215 --> 06:25.952
We've gotta stay together,
there's only one box!

06:28.221 --> 06:30.590
Where is he?
It all looks the same.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.426
Wait.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.461
The Trickster must have been
planning this for a while,

06:35.528 --> 06:39.165
before we even came here.
Someone in the village might
have seen something strange.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.701
-It could lead us to him.
-You're avoiding the question.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.002
How do we stop him?

06:43.069 --> 06:45.404
We worry about that
when we've found him.

06:45.471 --> 06:46.973
Village hall! Come on!

06:49.342 --> 06:51.043
How can she be here?

06:51.110 --> 06:53.513
Luke told me once
that when time goes wrong,

06:53.579 --> 06:56.949
it tries to compensate,
keep people on the same track.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.824
-Mum?
-No talking.

07:04.891 --> 07:07.326
-Go away.
-Mum, it's me, it's Rani.

07:07.393 --> 07:10.930
Why are you walking free?
Nobody walks free.

07:11.130 --> 07:14.867
Graske says no talking.
Go away.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.571
-What's he making you do?
Tell me.
-We're digging.

07:18.638 --> 07:23.109
The world's dead.
It fell apart.

07:23.176 --> 07:28.181
The Graske made us dig.
He won't stop till the last
minerals are torn up.

07:28.247 --> 07:31.751
Come on, organise a rebellion.
Where's everybody else?

07:31.818 --> 07:35.454
-We're the last humans.
-What have they done to you?

07:35.521 --> 07:38.591
Go away!

07:38.658 --> 07:43.563
Mum, please. Where's Dad?
Your husband. Haresh.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.432
No husband. Go!

07:46.499 --> 07:49.001
RANI: She was born
into this world,

07:49.068 --> 07:51.671
never met my dad.
I don't exist any longer.

07:51.737 --> 07:54.974
Rani, come on,
we are going back.
There's always a way.

07:57.577 --> 08:00.213
What happened?
How did the world die?

08:00.279 --> 08:03.850
Everybody knows the legend.
It was her!

08:03.916 --> 08:07.153
Who's "her"?
I mean, who's she?

08:07.220 --> 08:10.923
-Sarah Jane Smith.
-What? You're not serious.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.625
She handed the world to
the Trickster.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.127
What exactly happened?
What did she do?

08:15.194 --> 08:19.599
The legend says, years ago,
he tricked her.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.003
There was a car.

08:24.070 --> 08:28.875
Her parents never left in the
car and that made
a hole in the world,

08:30.076 --> 08:32.477
in the Abbot's Gateway.

08:32.544 --> 08:36.482
The Trickster walked through
the Abbot's Gateway

08:36.549 --> 08:38.851
and sucked
the life out of the world.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.587
The Abbot's Gateway?
What's the Abbot's Gateway?

08:41.654 --> 08:44.222
Humans! Back to work. Go!

08:44.290 --> 08:46.359
Mum, I'll save you, I promise.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.661
Everything's gonna be
all right, I promise!

No talking! Go away!

08:53.499 --> 08:58.204
The Abbot's Gateway!
Hang on, I'm working this out.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.273
We have to get back
there and tell them

09:00.339 --> 09:02.909
that the Trickster's coming
through the Abbot's Gateway.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.811
-Whatever that means.
-How can we get back there?

09:05.878 --> 09:08.881
The fissure's shut,
and it's the only way back.

09:08.948 --> 09:12.151
The Graske works
for the Trickster, right?
But why?

09:12.218 --> 09:16.022
-What does he get out of it?
-No idea.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.758
He can't grab us
or send us anywhere weird

09:18.824 --> 09:20.960
if we've got the box.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.429
Nowhere can be
worse than this.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.201
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

09:29.268 --> 09:33.706
It's getting worse out there.
Shame. I thought we could go
for a drive later.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.709
Here we go.
Sustenance for the troops.

09:38.377 --> 09:41.714
Hi, there.
You're going to think
this is very strange,

09:41.781 --> 09:43.716
but we need to
ask you something.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.785
In the last few days,
have you noticed

09:45.851 --> 09:47.787
anything new or strange
in the village? Something that
wasn't there before?

09:47.853 --> 09:49.555
No. What are you
talking about?

09:49.622 --> 09:52.158
-Please think, it's important.
-Are you two having a laugh?

09:52.224 --> 09:53.993
Do you know the village?
Can you come with us,

09:54.060 --> 09:55.661
see if you can find
anything that's changed?

09:55.728 --> 09:57.997
-But why? What's going on?
-We can't explain.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.266
Sorry, what is all this?
Are you taking the mick?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.368
Look after Sarah Jane.
I won't be five minutes.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.637
-Barbara, what are you doing?
-They look like
they're in trouble.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.306
None of our business.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.275

your mummy, Sarah Jane?
-(COOING)

10:18.150 --> 10:20.286
Are you sure about this?

10:20.353 --> 10:23.856
I'm just gonna do it
the way Sarah Jane does it.

10:25.858 --> 10:28.194
-We demand audience.
-You are rejects.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.129
No place here for you. Go.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.565
-Send us home.
-This is your home.

10:32.631 --> 10:35.968
-The Trickster
makes this your home.
-They're your slaves, right?

10:36.035 --> 10:37.870
Take rocks from this planet.

10:37.937 --> 10:43.309
Give Trickster powers to
leave, go into space.
Take other worlds.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.878
And then what?
Another job for the Trickster?

10:45.945 --> 10:48.347
'Cause they're your slaves,
but you're his slave,
aren't you?

10:48.414 --> 10:50.549
Graske never enslaved!

10:50.616 --> 10:53.686
Then why do you work for him?
What do you get out of it?

10:53.753 --> 10:57.390
Human, stupid.
Trickster stole me.

10:57.456 --> 11:01.460
-What happened? Tell us.
-You! Ha! Stupid!

11:01.527 --> 11:03.963
Can't be that
thick if we got this,
can we?

11:04.030 --> 11:08.868
Give it to me.
Humans must
give box to Graske.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.971
Uh-uh-uh!
You tell us how he got you.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.407
(GROANS)

11:16.108 --> 11:19.678
I was stupid.
Should have died.

11:19.745 --> 11:24.116
Trickster tricked me.
I was in a spaceship,
burning up.

-Krislok of the Graske.
-(GRASKE GROANING)

11:30.389 --> 11:34.727
Listen to me.
You don't have to die.

11:34.794 --> 11:39.198
I can lift you away
to be safe at my side.

11:39.265 --> 11:43.969
-But I must have
your agreement.
-(GROANING) What are you?

11:44.036 --> 11:47.673
Do you want to live?
Do I have your agreement?

11:47.740 --> 11:49.675
Agreed! Agreed!

11:49.742 --> 11:53.612
-I'm his slave.
-But you wanna escape?
Be free?

11:55.147 --> 11:58.918
Look at this.
It fights
the Trickster's power.

11:58.984 --> 12:02.121
-Protects us from him.
And you.
-Give it to me!

12:02.188 --> 12:05.391
So you do wanna be free?
Think. We can help you.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.961
Sarah Jane,
the lady you tricked
into doing all of this,

12:09.028 --> 12:11.363
she's defeated the Trickster
once before.

12:11.430 --> 12:15.668
But Trickster find me.
I never escape.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.770
Then I promise,
this time, we'll stop him.

12:17.837 --> 12:21.540
Then we'll give you this!
He'll never find you,
you'll be free.

12:21.607 --> 12:25.478
Open the fissure. Let us go
back to Sarah Jane.
We can help her.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.847
We can stop him
like she did before.

12:34.053 --> 12:36.956
-Will open fissure.
-Yes! Thank you!

12:37.022 --> 12:38.858
(ZAPPING)

12:43.796 --> 12:47.166
-You, stay with box.
-No. We can't do that.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.802
What'd you think
he was gonna say?
He needs a guarantee.

12:49.869 --> 12:53.639
-A hostage?
I'm not leaving you here.
-I'll be fine.

12:53.706 --> 12:57.109
And if this is what it's like,
I've had a belly full
of time travel, anyway.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.078
-Go.
-Clyde.

13:00.813 --> 13:04.917
-Hurry! Go!
-Cool.
Must be heroic more often.

13:06.919 --> 13:09.021
Remember! The Abbot's Gateway!

13:10.623 --> 13:12.658
I'll save you, Mum.

13:18.264 --> 13:21.867
-(THUNDER BOOMS)
-Right. Let's go.

13:25.871 --> 13:29.341
I can't see anything, David.
It all looks the way
it always has,

13:29.408 --> 13:31.043
-the way it always will be.
-I wouldn't bet on that.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.145
-There must be something.
-(THUNDER BOOMS)

13:33.212 --> 13:36.715
Luke! Over here.
I think I've found something!

13:37.850 --> 13:39.852
(SCANNING)

13:42.221 --> 13:45.024
What is that? Tell me.

13:45.090 --> 13:48.527
-What have you found, Mum?
-An unusual energy reaction.

13:53.699 --> 13:56.101
I can't see anything.
But he must be here.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.437
Listen! I'm helping you!

13:58.504 --> 14:01.340
And you've not listened to me.
You've not answered
any of my questions.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.210
Sorry. I really am sorry,
but we can't.
I wish I could.

14:04.276 --> 14:08.447
You think I'm stupid.
But I'm not.
That thing, the way you talk.

14:08.514 --> 14:12.885
"Energy reaction."
Are you from somewhere else?

14:12.952 --> 14:16.622
No. And I don't
think you're stupid, Barbara.
I think you're amazing.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.291
And a brilliant mother,
more than I'd ever
hoped you'd be.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.928
-But I can't
say anything more.
-(BEEPING)

14:23.128 --> 14:25.731
No sign of your
winner yet, Mr Smith?

14:25.798 --> 14:30.369
No. Something's not
right with that lad.
Or his mother.

14:30.436 --> 14:34.073
-Sandwich?
Ham there, cheese there.
-Never say no to free grub.

14:36.141 --> 14:40.045
Oh, my goodness!

14:40.112 --> 14:43.249
Yes, hello!
Ethnic person in the 50s, hi.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.919
-Listen, please,
it's important.
-Not another one.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.989
-I'm looking for
Sarah Jane Smith.
-What?

14:50.055 --> 14:52.191
What do you want?
She's right there.

14:52.258 --> 14:55.728
-(GURGLING)
-Oh, wow.

14:55.794 --> 14:59.131
-And you're her dad, right?
-What do you want?
What's going on?

14:59.198 --> 15:01.433
No, I didn't mean I
was looking for her.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.870
I'm looking for a woman,
short, brown hair,
very pretty.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.840
Probably with her son.
He's a bit weird.

15:07.906 --> 15:10.009
-Oh, you mean
Victoria Beckham?
-What?

15:10.075 --> 15:13.078
-Well, they were here.
-Right.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.681
-Where've they gone?
-They're around.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.684
Said they were looking
for something unusual.
Whatever that means.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.886
Right. Thank you.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.125
What on earth was she wearing?

15:26.191 --> 15:29.395
Can that really be the fashion
in the Punjab?

15:29.461 --> 15:32.931
-Mrs King, will you
watch the baby, please?
-Of course. Off you pop.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.634
Luke!

15:37.469 --> 15:38.570
Luke!

15:45.144 --> 15:47.079
Rani! Over here!

15:51.917 --> 15:53.786
-RANI: Sarah Jane!
-How did you get here?

15:53.852 --> 15:55.921
-Long story.
-Why did you call her that?

15:55.988 --> 15:57.956
-I did it again.
-Who are you

15:58.023 --> 15:59.992
and why did you
call her Sarah Jane?

16:00.059 --> 16:03.562
You stopped your parents
driving off. They never got
in the car, right?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.831
Yes, but how
can you know that?

16:05.898 --> 16:08.467
Doesn't matter.
The important thing is
the Abbot's Gateway.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.203
The Trickster
is coming through
the Abbot's Gateway!

16:11.270 --> 16:13.505
-What's the Abbot's Gateway?
-Over there.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.041
-It's what they
call that arch thing.
-Of course.

16:16.108 --> 16:18.544
Religious sites,
hallowed ground.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.914
Sometimes that's
where the web of time
is at its weakest.

16:26.218 --> 16:27.986
I can't see anything.

16:28.053 --> 16:31.323
The same emission patterns,
nothing specific.
No sign of him.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.125
But I know
the Trickster
comes through here!

16:33.192 --> 16:35.994
-SARAH JANE: How do you know?
-My mum told me.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.930
Your mum? What?

16:37.996 --> 16:41.633
Listen, you called her
Sarah Jane. Why did you call
her Sarah Jane?

16:41.700 --> 16:43.969
(THUNDER BOOMS)

16:44.036 --> 16:47.539
Oh, yes.
There! A crack in time.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.845
-He's coming through.
-What's that? Oh, no.

16:52.911 --> 16:56.515
Barbara!
You're coming back home
with me, right now.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.885
Wait. Eddie, look!

16:59.952 --> 17:03.622
That thing.
Something's happening,
something really strange.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.925
We're going home now.
You stay away from us!

17:06.992 --> 17:12.931
-I didn't want it
to be like this.
-Soon, I will be free!

17:15.300 --> 17:18.303
There you are!
All settled, I hope?

17:18.369 --> 17:21.940
The storm's getting worse.
Not that
anything bothers madam.

17:22.007 --> 17:24.410
I'll leave you
both to it, then.

17:26.578 --> 17:29.181
Look, let's cheer
ourselves up a bit, eh?

17:29.248 --> 17:31.917
We'll go home,
switch on the wireless

17:31.984 --> 17:35.487
and see what's on
the Light Programme tonight.

17:35.687 --> 17:38.624
What the heck's going on?
It's rotten.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.862
It's to do with us.
Eddie, look.

17:45.664 --> 17:49.835
-What's happening?
-Everything we
touch turns bad.

17:52.037 --> 17:55.073
It's us.
Something's wrong with us.

17:57.309 --> 18:03.849
(EXHALING) I can breathe.
Soon, I will be strong!

18:03.916 --> 18:07.519
I can find the frequency
you're using to manifest
yourself and block it.

18:07.586 --> 18:12.925
-Empty words.
Technology can't help you.
-(BUZZING)

18:12.991 --> 18:15.227
No. I'm going
to send you back!

18:15.294 --> 18:20.766
Soon all three of you
will cease to exist.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.368
I will step from this door

18:24.536 --> 18:29.107
and consume this
world in chaos!

18:29.174 --> 18:31.910
It's not too late.
There's only one
way to stop him, Mum.

18:31.977 --> 18:35.848
-We've both
known it all along.
-No. I can't!

18:35.914 --> 18:37.983
Use the sonic. Repair the car.

18:38.050 --> 18:41.653
And send your
parents to their deaths!

18:42.921 --> 18:47.526
Will you be the agent
of their destruction?

18:47.593 --> 18:50.462
(ZAPPING)

18:50.529 --> 18:53.832
That Indian girl.
She said
something to Victoria.

18:53.899 --> 18:57.503
She said,
"You stopped them driving off,
they never left in the car."

18:57.569 --> 19:00.706
As if it was a bad thing
that we didn't go.

19:00.772 --> 19:05.143
And not going, that let out
that terrible
creature under the arch.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.845
None of this makes sense.

19:06.912 --> 19:10.449
It does,
if you think about Victoria,
who she really is.

19:10.516 --> 19:15.487
-That girl,
she called her Sarah Jane.
-(BABY CRYING)

19:17.789 --> 19:19.858
I said I'd seen her before.

19:22.094 --> 19:27.432
Too late!
I'm growing stronger.

19:27.499 --> 19:31.470
RANI: It's too late. They
won't drive off and you
won't make them.

19:32.471 --> 19:35.073
(ZAPPING)

19:35.140 --> 19:39.111
Rani's right.
I won't kill my
own mum and dad.

19:39.177 --> 19:42.614
-I can't do it!
He's beaten me.
-BARBARA: Victoria!

19:47.386 --> 19:50.322
If we get in the car
and drive away right now,

19:50.389 --> 19:53.926
then that's the end of
that thing under the arch.
I know I'm right.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.194
You can't. You mustn't go.

19:56.261 --> 20:00.566
We've got to.
But not Sarah Jane.
Not our baby.

20:00.632 --> 20:03.035
Take her. Look after her.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.371
This is why
they left that day.

20:06.438 --> 20:09.241
They didn't abandon you, Mum.
They saved you.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.210
One thing, though.
It's important.

20:12.277 --> 20:17.449
Sarah Jane,
our baby, is she safe?
Does she have a good life?

20:17.516 --> 20:24.089
Yes. So many incredible
things. Things you wouldn't
believe. Don't go.

20:24.156 --> 20:28.527
-Got to, though, haven't we?
-Like he worked any of it out.

20:28.594 --> 20:32.664
I said, didn't I?
I don't understand it,

20:32.731 --> 20:36.301
but sometimes
the heart knows things
the mind can't explain.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.870
(SOBBING) Mum. Dad.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.974
Come here, come here.

20:44.509 --> 20:47.379
Look at you,
you're older than us.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.949
And you came all
that way to see us.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.251
I thought you'd
left me behind.

20:53.318 --> 20:57.956
I never knew you, I never had
the chance. It was so unfair.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.058
Who said life was fair, eh?

21:05.030 --> 21:08.100
I tried so hard
to resist the temptation.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.936
I knew the dangers.
But I just
couldn't stop myself.

21:11.136 --> 21:14.406
-I had to see you.
-I'm so glad you did.

21:14.473 --> 21:15.874
So am I, Mum.

21:24.182 --> 21:28.453
-Goodbye, Sarah Jane.
-(GURGLING)

21:30.088 --> 21:32.157
Goodbye, Sarah Jane.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.433
Goodbye, Sarah Jane.

21:43.869 --> 21:48.607
Goodbye, Dad.
I won't forget you.
I'll never forget you.

22:12.798 --> 22:16.868
(GROANING) No!
Stop them, stop them!

22:21.206 --> 22:27.446
You have denied me my hunger!

22:27.512 --> 22:32.084
I did nothing.
That was my mum and dad,
saving the world.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.553
Something we
Smiths can't help doing.

22:34.619 --> 22:37.622
But you, you couldn't do it.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.827
I knew you could never do it!

22:41.893 --> 22:45.430
You were right.
I couldn't send them off.

22:45.497 --> 22:49.935
But you didn't
count on one thing.
They were brilliant.

22:50.135 --> 22:53.071
They worked it out,
they went by themselves.

22:53.138 --> 22:56.241
My mum and dad defeated you!

22:56.308 --> 22:58.710
(SCREAMING)

23:06.551 --> 23:08.754
(BABY GURGLING)

23:08.820 --> 23:13.558
We've got to put
things back on track.
We've got to leave her.

(GURGLING)

23:23.935 --> 23:25.670

(GRUNTING)

23:31.376 --> 23:33.712
(BOTH SCREAMING)

23:37.315 --> 23:39.484
Yes!

23:39.551 --> 23:43.555
See, I told you, she did it!
Sarah Jane is the man!

23:43.622 --> 23:46.591
Give box. We did deal.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.029
I'm a man of my word.

23:53.131 --> 23:55.534
Ha! Free!

23:57.369 --> 23:59.871
Right. Come on, Sarah Jane.

-(ZAPPING)
-Sarah Jane, look at you.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.347
You did it!
We did it, the team!

24:42.414 --> 24:44.850
I'm missing something,
aren't I?

24:48.286 --> 24:51.223
This time it stays closed.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.158
(ZAPPING)

25:02.567 --> 25:03.869
Let's go home.

25:12.377 --> 25:15.847
Hello! You didn't say
you were with Sarah.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.917
I've been phoning
all afternoon. I was just
about to get worried.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.987
I like your look!
Where've you been?
Somewhere nice?

25:22.053 --> 25:24.923
Mum, come here!

25:24.990 --> 25:28.326
What's brought this on?
What are you after?

25:28.393 --> 25:31.963
-Sarah, come on,
what's she done?
-She's been great.

25:32.030 --> 25:36.434
-Rani, the state of your room,
like a bomb's hit it.
-Dad!

25:36.501 --> 25:39.838
I'll go clean my room
right now.
I'll do anything you want.

25:39.905 --> 25:43.008
What did I do to deserve this?
I thought you were getting
too old for cuddles.

25:43.074 --> 25:46.511
Oh, no.
Not for as long as you live.

25:46.578 --> 25:50.248
Bye, Sarah. Bye, boys.
Come on, you.

25:50.315 --> 25:51.683

have to do your room.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.885
(RANI LAUGHING)

25:53.952 --> 25:56.021
I'll be off home, then.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.090
Today I've been
to an alternative timeline

25:59.157 --> 26:01.993
and now I'm saying,
"I'll be off home, then."

26:02.060 --> 26:07.365
That's the life we lead.
Sometimes it
brings you such joy

26:07.432 --> 26:10.869
and sometimes it brings you
the worst things in the world.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.151
That's all I ever had of them.

26:27.252 --> 26:31.489
But life goes on. It has to.

26:31.556 --> 26:34.059
Oh, Luke.
They were my mum and dad.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.862
And they were wonderful.

26:37.929 --> 26:41.433
(INAUDIBLE)

26:41.499 --> 26:46.871
It's made me
realise I'm so lucky,
because I've got my mum.

-I've got you.
-Oh!

-My mum, she's disappeared.
-Is it aliens?

27:13.064 --> 27:14.466
-What do you want?
-Your help.

After you kidnapped my mum
and put her in a trance?

27:16.701 --> 27:19.237
