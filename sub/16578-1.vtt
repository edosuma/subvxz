SCARLETT: (ON LAPTOP) Good job, boys.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.367
Eye contact is very important
when trying to seduce your partner.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.537
It's the most overlooked step by virgins,
so remember this for your first time.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.663
Yeah, yeah, we get it.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.333
Look at them
before you fuck their brains out.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.542
Now, can we move on to the sex positions?

01:22.666 --> 01:24.963
'Cause that's what I paid $80 for.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.715
Actually, that's what I paid $80 for.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.672
Yeah, don't worry, Jack.
I'll pay you back, I'll pay you back.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.132
You boys can figure this out later.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.180
Right now, I want you to pretend
that Bailey is a girl from class

01:33.260 --> 01:34.598
that you brought home to your room.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.391
Show me how you would seduce her.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.269
Jack, you go first.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.907
Hey. (CHUCKLES) Hey there, Bailey.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.068
Um, how was school for you today?

For me, it was okay.

(CHUCKLES)

01:55.324 --> 01:56.496
I had a stomach ache, though.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.540
But the nurse just said I ate too much.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.041
What are you doing?

Oh, my fucking God.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.696
Okay, Jack, that's enough.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.158
Not one girl is gonna wanna sleep with you
with that lack of confidence.

You need to work on that.

I would only find work

08:19.499 --> 08:21.877

I would play Wolverine,
