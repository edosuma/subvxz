WEBVTT

00:06.173 --> 00:08.884
And this is our main hall.

00:09.135 --> 00:12.304
Feel free to plan your dream.

00:12.388 --> 00:15.224
-If you need me, I'll be in my office.
-Thanks.

00:15.266 --> 00:16.517
7 YEARS AGO

00:18.519 --> 00:19.437
Damn.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.564
I have no doubts.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.315
We're gonna marry here.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.444
Your wish is my command.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.904
I have a surprise for you.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.198
What do you mean, surprise?

00:31.282 --> 00:33.576
-Here, now? Is that what I'm thinking?
-No.

00:33.659 --> 00:34.535
Of course not.

00:34.618 --> 00:35.661
No?

00:36.662 --> 00:37.663
Hey.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.542
Wait, now I'm curious.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.004
What might that be?

00:49.675 --> 00:53.804
A Rolling Stones T-shirt.

00:54.847 --> 00:55.848
You didn't like it.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.641
-I love it.
-You don't.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.851
-I love it.
-I know.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.186
I love it, really.

01:00.311 --> 01:02.980
From now on,
this will be my favorite T-shirt.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.816
I'm telling you.
To prove that, I'll do something

01:05.900 --> 01:07.401
you've never seen before.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.237
-What?
-A reverse striptease.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.281
-Are you ready?
-Silly.

01:26.504 --> 01:27.505
Seduce me.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.589
I will.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.220
So?

01:35.095 --> 01:35.930
I love it.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.140
Let me fix this.

01:38.849 --> 01:39.683
It looks great.

01:40.351 --> 01:41.602
-Did you like it?
-Yes.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.650
It's just a souvenir
because today is a special day.

01:47.942 --> 01:48.859
Today is special?

01:49.527 --> 01:50.486
Okay.

01:50.820 --> 01:54.698
It's our two-year anniversary, isn't it?

01:54.990 --> 01:58.577
-I have a surprise, too. Take it easy.
-No way. You don't.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.080
-I do.
-I doubt that.

02:01.497 --> 02:04.041
-Close your eyes.
-Really?

02:05.876 --> 02:07.169
Now open your mouth.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.679
This one's even better.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.016
-Was it good for you?
-Can I open my eyes?

02:21.392 --> 02:23.811
-No, not yet.
-There's one more surprise.

02:23.978 --> 02:24.854
Another one?

02:27.815 --> 02:28.732
Open your eyes.

02:30.693 --> 02:31.735
I can't believe it.

02:32.361 --> 02:35.322
-Didn't you need a new one?
-You're so cute.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.202
Now I'm embarrassed,
I didn't get you anything.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.704
Don't worry.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.832
You can give me a gift later at my place.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.293
I'll be the one moaning.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.861
Be happy for your mom.
If the guy is cool, let her be.

03:13.944 --> 03:17.364
Now the guy has the right
to bang my mom at my own house?

03:17.448 --> 03:18.532
Your house?

03:18.908 --> 03:20.618
Wait, Caco, put that back.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.953
Wearing a suit in Rio makes no sense.

03:23.037 --> 03:27.041
I can't afford to make sense.
Everybody wears a suit at this company.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.959
But you're not everybody.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.837
My mom used to say that.
Let's find something else.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.173
Look at this, Caco.

03:34.298 --> 03:38.135
Look at this, it's so country.
It suits you well.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.553
You gotta innovate.

03:39.762 --> 03:42.431
The Facebook guy used
to work wearing a sweat suit.

03:42.514 --> 03:46.226
Maybe you could wear a sweat suit
and be the next one.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.227
Hold it.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.812
I'm gonna grab a tie.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.230
Come again?

03:56.528 --> 03:58.197
I have butterflies in my stomach.

03:58.489 --> 04:00.950
I just got divorced
and I'm marrying again.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.870
My mom says husbands are all the same,
only the address changes.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.289
Then it's settled.

04:07.373 --> 04:10.042
Isn't it what you wanted,
moving into another flat?

04:10.834 --> 04:14.046
I don't want people thinking
I have an agenda.

04:14.338 --> 04:19.009
Sure, living with that ugly guy,
everybody will think that way.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.303
Come on, boy!

04:21.971 --> 04:25.099
The beach is huge,
and you're running next to us.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.893
That's Lucas, Camila,
my boyfriend I told you about.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.186
Hey, I'm sorry.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.115
Guys, I'm here.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.783
My bad.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.368
I'm gonna play soccer.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.704
-Don't run away.
-No. No way.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.622
Bye.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.795
Are you teaching sex education
to teenagers?

04:55.087 --> 04:56.463
No, he's of legal age.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.758
If I were a man,
you wouldn't say anything.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.888
Conga, you're an independent woman.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.725
If things go south,
pack your stuff and leave.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.187
It's important to have a backup plan.

05:15.107 --> 05:18.485
<i>Sure, Mommy will always be</i>
<i>your backup plan. But what for?</i>

05:18.569 --> 05:19.820
Mom, I don't know.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.030
If things go south.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.283
All things, Roberto Carlos,
the apartment, all of it.

05:24.742 --> 05:25.784
Can I go back home?

05:25.868 --> 05:30.622
<i>I'll always have your back,</i>
<i>but I can't let you come back.</i>

05:30.706 --> 05:32.875
<i>Remember Marcos from ballroom dance?</i>

05:33.375 --> 05:36.670
-No.
<i>-He twisted his ankle and moved in here.</i>

05:37.963 --> 05:41.091
Since when is that a reason to move in?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.927
Is he at least helping you pay the bills?

05:44.011 --> 05:47.014
<i>This concept of men paying bills is</i>
<i>so old-fashioned.</i>

05:47.097 --> 05:51.393
This means besides you,
I'll have to support Marcos, too?

05:51.894 --> 05:53.353
That's all I need.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.153
Caco.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.031
Hey.

06:04.573 --> 06:05.574
Look.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.744
Help me with this or I'll throw this away.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.330
Wait, let me see.

06:12.623 --> 06:15.417
You can't transfer everything
or it'll crash.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.086
What do I do?

06:18.337 --> 06:20.798
You gotta delete the biggest files,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.800
those you won't need anymore.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.595
Look, there's a 5GB one.
It must be the problem.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.024
Okay, don't transfer that one.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.111
That's it.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.279
Delete everything you won't miss.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.496
Don't forget it's your turn
to pay for the condo.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.000
One more thing.

06:57.084 --> 07:01.255
If you rent your part of the place,
start looking for somebody.

07:02.965 --> 07:05.425
Okay. I'll handle this.

07:27.156 --> 07:27.990
Good morning.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.491
Good morning.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.118
Good morning, Caco.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.036
Tapioca's still warm.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.419
No, I'm not hungry.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.341
Sweet, huh?

07:47.551 --> 07:48.552
It's delicious.

07:50.929 --> 07:51.930
Camila.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.682
Can you help me out here?

07:53.891 --> 07:54.725
Okay.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.946
-What's he doing with my T-shirt?
-I don't know.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.574
-Maybe he has the same one.
-No way, it's mine.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.242
-Easy, Caco.
-Don't "easy" me.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.077
He's taking all that's mine.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.372
You don't need to have a heart attack.
I'll ask for it back.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.665
You'd better.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.251
And you'd better focus
on the job interview

08:21.335 --> 08:23.420
instead of worrying about an old T-shirt.

08:23.879 --> 08:24.880
Come on.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.849
-Where is he?
-Just left.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.017
Wearing it?

08:37.643 --> 08:39.436
I can't believe it, holy shit!

08:39.519 --> 08:42.481
-Who told you to leave it in my closet?
-The nerve of him!

08:43.190 --> 08:45.567
Take it easy.
Let's focus on your interview.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.778
You're gonna nail it, Caquito.

08:48.779 --> 08:53.533
Tell them your Spanish is semi-fluent,
but don't mention your basic English.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.410
Go get 'em. Good luck.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.250
What did you forget?

09:03.585 --> 09:06.088
-Ana. How are you?
-I missed you. Fine.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.508
Look, I knew you'd get back on your feet.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.968
Yes, I did.

09:12.344 --> 09:17.349
I wanna invite you and your boyfriend
to play cards at my place tonight.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.309
I can't make it tonight.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.187
I can't. There's no way.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.232
How much is the stake?

09:25.816 --> 09:29.278
Our game will be upgraded
to the 2.1S version.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.071
I'll think about it.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.450
I want you to know
you can count on me, okay?

09:35.617 --> 09:37.119
As women, we must unite.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.455
Okay, I'm gonna talk to him.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.421
Look, way better than Caco, you see?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.815
Easy, easy, easy.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.948
I have an appointment
with Mr. Vasconcelos at 10:30.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.783
ID, please.

10:16.867 --> 10:20.245
Carlos Augusto da Silva.
Mr. Vasconcelos at 10:30.

10:25.959 --> 10:26.960
Just a minute.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.756
Yes.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.633
No way...

10:38.180 --> 10:40.015
Hey?

10:49.691 --> 10:53.111
Hey, sorry I'm late,
I had a problem downstairs.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.697
That's okay, we're doing

10:55.781 --> 10:58.909
a group exercise
that's part of the selection process.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.243
Please.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.204
Moving on...

11:02.537 --> 11:05.832
I'm gonna post how irresponsible you are.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.084
You're totally right.

11:07.751 --> 11:08.752
Totally right.

11:08.919 --> 11:11.254
We haven't met our deadline,

11:11.880 --> 11:14.216
but we'll prioritize your next buy.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.929
And we won't charge you for delivery
and will give you a discount of 25%...

11:21.306 --> 11:24.976
Great. That's it, empathy.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.478
Very good, you may sit.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.980
The next pair...

11:29.064 --> 11:30.065
You...

11:30.190 --> 11:31.191
And you.

11:31.608 --> 11:35.070
You'll play the aggressive customer role.
Okay? Go on.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.745
Go ahead.

11:48.834 --> 11:52.504
You promised me a delivery,
and I didn't get it. You're incompetent.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.679
I can try to solve this for you.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.932
More aggressive. A little more aggressive.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.267
Try to annoy him.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.939
I'll talk to your boss.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.733
Because you don't deserve a thing.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.570
Yes, make it personal. Test him.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.199
I can solve this personally for you
if you relax

12:21.950 --> 12:23.076
a little bit.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.581
You won't solve anything
because you don't solve a thing.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.833
You don't solve a damn thing!

12:31.501 --> 12:34.504
Everything you've done was wrong.
You just make mistakes.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.798
You're a total failure.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.802
You're a loser.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.724
And you'll continue leading
this shitty life.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.059
You're a failure.

12:58.862 --> 12:59.946
Hey.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.364
How did it go?

13:01.990 --> 13:03.283
Excellent.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.910
Amazing.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.036
Brilliant. Great.

13:10.916 --> 13:14.794
Unfortunately, I was overqualified
for what they were offering me.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.005
Jeez, I had such high hopes.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.882
But I left a good impression.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.509
Let me go.

13:22.677 --> 13:26.598
I'm sure if there's an opening
at my level, they'll call me back.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.059
Well, what matter is
they liked you, right?

14:31.162 --> 14:34.583
TRANSFERRING WEDDING

14:34.666 --> 14:36.001
Roberto Carlos...

14:37.085 --> 14:40.297
Last time we renovated the penthouse,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.507
do you know which hotel we stayed at?

14:42.591 --> 14:44.509
Guess.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.512
-At mine?
-Bingo!

14:47.679 --> 14:49.014
Exactly.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.642
But I'm not the only owner,
there are other partners.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.480
It's your turn, baby.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.567
Whoa...

15:00.650 --> 15:02.068
-What is it?
-I win.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.155
Give me that.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.824
No, come on, Camila.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.410
Now you don't need that pittance anymore.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.037
What do you mean?

15:15.957 --> 15:19.252
-No...
-I don't get it.

15:19.628 --> 15:20.712
-Guys.
-It's nothing.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.006
Thank you for the invitation,
but it's late.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.467
I have to wake up early,
we have stuff to do.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.303
-Yes.
-No.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.641
I'll borrow him a little. Let's go
to my bedroom and see the new decoration.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.018
Just a moment.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.691
You're very lucky.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.318
If I had

15:43.693 --> 15:47.030
a backup plan like Roberto Carlos, man!

15:47.989 --> 15:51.076
I'd have dumped Guilherme a long time ago.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.829
The great Roberto Carlos...

16:03.254 --> 16:05.131
I'd like to ask you something,

16:05.215 --> 16:07.634
but, please, don't get me wrong.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.057
Can you give me your phone?

16:16.810 --> 16:18.436
I'd like to tell you something.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.650
I know I've been distant lately, but...

16:24.275 --> 16:27.404
I'm going through hard times, you know?

16:27.696 --> 16:30.031
-This treatment to get pregnant...
-Excuse me?

16:30.115 --> 16:32.242
It's a lot of shots, hormones...

16:32.617 --> 16:35.286
-It's a lot of pain, you know?
-Yes.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.956
The actual phone. Do you have it?

16:38.707 --> 16:39.708
Yes, I do.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.042
Great.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.502
What do you want it for?

16:42.585 --> 16:46.005
Just in case. I'm gonna get mine, too.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.843
We're being watched all the time nowadays.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.720
You can't trust anyone.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.141
I don't know what else to do.
We've tried everything and...

16:59.728 --> 17:00.729
Guilherme is gay.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.830
I know, girl.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.874
This is very hard.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.876
It is.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.503
I knew it.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.005
Excuse me?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.634
If you knew what I've been through...

17:32.218 --> 17:35.472
You and I together,
we have a great future.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.017
What do you mean?

17:40.643 --> 17:42.687
I have a unique opportunity for you.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.483
We can make a lot of money
with your hotel in the Caribbean.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.152
But we don't have any hotel there.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.237
But you will.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.284
And with my slot machines,

17:57.160 --> 17:58.661
the house always wins.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.709
Well...

18:04.793 --> 18:07.253
Bye.

18:19.557 --> 18:20.558
Tell me the truth.

18:20.809 --> 18:23.520
You're gonna miss
your neighbors a lot, right?

19:00.390 --> 19:04.602
Bro, Camila is so insensitive
to get to this point.

19:04.936 --> 19:08.398
What if I told you
Bugs Bunny's always been like this?

19:08.940 --> 19:11.109
You've noticed that now, right?

19:11.484 --> 19:12.652
That's not new to me.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.612
<i>But it's mine, Marcinho.</i>

19:14.696 --> 19:17.532
<i>-And the idiot keeps wearing it.</i>
-I'm not surprised.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.534
<i>I'll get it back no matter what.</i>

19:20.368 --> 19:21.202
What?

19:23.580 --> 19:24.581
<i>Hello?</i>

19:25.748 --> 19:27.000
Hello, Marcinho?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.210
Marcinho...

19:31.087 --> 19:35.049
How many times do I have to tell you
to knock on my door before entering?

19:36.968 --> 19:39.721
That kind of scene traumatizes
a kid for life.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.348
You haven't been a kid for a long time.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.144
In fact, it's past time you left home.

19:47.645 --> 19:48.897
Are you serious, Mom?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.065
That talk again?

19:51.149 --> 19:54.944
Besides traumatizing me
and causing huge psychological damage,

19:55.528 --> 19:57.238
you're kicking me out.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.908
Son, I'm not kicking you out.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.367
Not yet,

20:02.076 --> 20:03.369
but think about it.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.708
Come on.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.711
Suck it up. Suck it up now.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.505
Or you'll learn what trauma really is.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.009
Nonsense.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.929
That's all I needed.

20:25.808 --> 20:26.768
My man!

20:28.478 --> 20:30.021
I know how to play.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.649
-Hey.
-You serve.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.567
Ana?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.236
-Are you okay?
-I am.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.239
I felt like playing tennis with you guys.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.867
Let's rock, my queen.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.911
No, go to the other side.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.454
I'm used to playing alone.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.002
You serve.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.295
Okay, don't worry.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.381
I always get everything.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.194
Ana, easy. What's this?

21:18.736 --> 21:19.737
Take it easy.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.823
Easy, Ana.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.992
What's this?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.166
My mom gave it to me.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.336
-Yeah.
-But it doesn't really match.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.682
I can't wait for you
to move into my place.

21:50.518 --> 21:51.519
What is it?

21:54.731 --> 21:55.732
What is it?

21:56.941 --> 21:58.067
Did I do something?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.235
What?

21:59.569 --> 22:00.611
Tell me, come on.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.907
I like this quilt.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.911
What am I gonna do with it now?

22:09.787 --> 22:11.122
Where am I gonna put it?

22:14.292 --> 22:16.794
I don't have a backup plan for this quilt.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.297
No problem.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.383
Everything's fine. I'm sorry.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.595
The bedspread stays.
It's going to look beautiful.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.264
Okay?

22:31.059 --> 22:32.310
Do you want chocolate?

22:39.192 --> 22:40.026
Yes.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.907
Did you know Caco wants
to get back with Camila?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.159
Excuse me?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.328
Let's get a pizza

22:50.453 --> 22:53.831
and I'll tell you about it. Shall we?

22:53.956 --> 22:56.709
No.

23:06.344 --> 23:09.430
Breaking news!

23:11.516 --> 23:15.186
Caco wants to get back to you,
whatever it takes!

23:23.820 --> 23:25.863
I had it washed, okay?

23:26.155 --> 23:27.782
I'm sorry it took so long.

23:30.034 --> 23:33.788
I thought it was important to give it
back because, Caco, I guess

23:34.789 --> 23:36.582
every man must have what's his.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.920
This T-shirt was made for me

23:41.921 --> 23:43.548
with lots of affection and love.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.093
Even if it's worn out,
it still looks better on me.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.429
I disagree. I don't think it's worn out.

23:50.721 --> 23:51.806
I don't think so.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.268
Also, I think it's happier with me.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.605
But this T-shirt is mine.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.233
This T-shirt is yours.

24:02.733 --> 24:03.734
It's mine.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.660
I wanna give you a gift.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.079
What for, Caco?

24:15.204 --> 24:19.125
So you know I look up to you
and I'll root for you no matter what.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.751
But I already know that.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.674
I know you can't live
without your espresso.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.384
How sweet.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.469
Caco, thanks.

24:30.678 --> 24:33.723
But you didn't have to.
Here's the thing. Keep it.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.975
Roberto Carlos has a newer model.

24:36.934 --> 24:37.935
You keep this.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.229
Beautiful.

25:07.006 --> 25:07.924
Hey.

25:09.425 --> 25:10.426
What's up?

25:13.554 --> 25:15.932
Look, I've been thinking and...

25:16.307 --> 25:17.141
You win.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.519
You can keep it.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.169
DIVORCE MOTION
