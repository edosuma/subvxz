38:15.902 --> 38:18.034
AS THE QB COACH,
I SHOULD HAVE
PICKED UP ON IT.

38:18.078 --> 38:20.341
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW IT'S YOUR FAULT
IF HE HID IT FROM YOU.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.343
PART OF BEING A COACH

38:22.387 --> 38:25.172
IS BEING ABLE
TO PROTECT THE PLAYERS
FROM THEMSELVES.

38:25.215 --> 38:28.523

IF I'M SERIOUS
ABOUT WANTING

38:49.022 --> 38:50.980
