00:51.301 --> 00:52.635
Last week, Flash Gordon

00:52.720 --> 00:53.970
defended the Witch Queen Azura

00:54.054 --> 00:55.346
from the attack of the Death dwarfs.

00:55.431 --> 00:58.224
Paul, having proclaimed himself
King of Blue Magic Land

00:58.308 --> 01:01.602
offered John the Hawkman
the command of the army...

01:20.956 --> 01:22.707
Go on, then, Paul.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.125
Don't be long.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.482
Paul?

01:51.695 --> 01:52.862
Paul?

01:59.203 --> 02:00.328
Paul.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.432
- He winked at me! He winked at me!
- Whoo!

03:35.465 --> 03:36.841
l love it here.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.010
You know, it feels so...

03:39.094 --> 03:40.761
- Right.
- Yeah.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.723
We're 5,339 miles from home

03:43.807 --> 03:46.267
and yet, somehow, l feel like we belong.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.269
l know what you mean.

03:48.353 --> 03:52.023
l think this is probably
the most fun l have ever had.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.442
l'm so glad we came, Clive.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.319
Clive?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.072
- May l?
- Be my guest.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.325
- Thank you.
- l was over there, on my own.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.285
That there is the Black Vampire.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.745
Watch out.

04:05.829 --> 04:06.996
She bites.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.080
How much?

04:08.165 --> 04:10.875
$1 ,349.99.

04:13.879 --> 04:14.879
Aren't you gonna get it?

04:16.048 --> 04:17.089
Fair enough.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.135
l can't believe we're gonna
meet Adam Shadowchild.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.763
l know.
He's, like, the coolest man in the world.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.806
Thank you.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.518
Come forth. Welcome, my friends.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.189
l just wanted to say that the Planet Fall
trilogy has been a huge influence

04:33.273 --> 04:35.358
on me and on my work.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.943
Don't tell me. You're a writer.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.655
- l am, yeah.
- Well, good.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.449
He actually won a Nebulon Award in 1992.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.577
For best science fiction short story
by a male under 16.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.663
- l'm working on a follow-up.
- Oh.

04:48.747 --> 04:49.830
Oh, l'd love to see that.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.123
Not today.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.000
No, no. lt's a legal thing.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.378
l'm sure it's good.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.297
That is a wonderful cover. Three tits.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.342
Awesome.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.928
- That was Graeme, my illustrator.
- l'm an artist.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.055
l'm hoping to complete it soon.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.266
l'm just having a bit of trouble
with the ending.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.020
Well, a wise man said,

05:13.105 --> 05:16.065
"You have to spin a good yarn
before you can weave a great dream."

05:16.400 --> 05:17.983
Who said that?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.402
l did. l just said that.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.861
Move along, please, guys.

05:20.946 --> 05:21.946
Yes.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.823
- Very nice to meet you.
- No, no...

05:23.907 --> 05:25.157
Thank you.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.286
- You bought a book?
- No.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.871
Then fuck off.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.499
Let's get a picture of you, me and Adam.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.167
- Okay, ready.
- Ready.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.592
Yes.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.928
Yes.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.013
- ls that the RV place?
- Yes.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.307
And there's definitely two single beds?

05:50.434 --> 05:53.644
Because there's been
a bit of a mix-up at the hotel.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.730
Okay. Excellent. Thank you very much.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.733
And have a nice day to you, as well.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.111
- ls it here?
- lt's in the car park.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.529
l think you mean "the parking lot."

06:03.613 --> 06:04.947
l sure do.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.324
l did my American voice.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.662
lt's amazing, isn't it?
We're actually here. America.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.330
Huh?

06:13.415 --> 06:15.958
How long have we dreamt about this?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.877
- Since we were kids.
- Yeah.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.588
Now look at us. Grown men.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.215
Pizza!

06:24.551 --> 06:25.843
- Hi!
- Hiya!

06:26.344 --> 06:28.345
- Good evening, sir.
- Come on in.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.184
- Where can l set this down?
- You could put it on the bed.

06:33.769 --> 06:34.935
You guys on honeymoon?

06:36.146 --> 06:37.396
No.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.316
No, silly. We're just friends.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.818
We had a mix-up.
The reservations were messed up.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.904
Pop it on the table here. Let me clear that.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.282
- Ah, going on a road trip?
- Yeah. Yes.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.951
What better way to follow Comic-Con

06:51.036 --> 06:54.205
than a tour ofAmerica's
most famous UFO hotspots?

06:54.539 --> 06:55.539
Huh?

06:56.708 --> 07:00.711
We're going to Area 51
and the Black Mailbox in Nevada,

07:00.837 --> 07:03.881
then down to Camp Verde,
then to Apache Junction

07:03.965 --> 07:08.177
and then on down to Roswell, New Mexico
for the site of the famous crash of '47.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.595
- No.
- Everybody knows that.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.181
Stop it! lt's an alleged site at this point.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.432
Why would they admit there was a crash,

07:13.517 --> 07:14.683
if the crash happened somewhere else?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.311
Let's just agree to disagree, all right?

07:17.395 --> 07:18.562
That's what we always say at the end.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.067
Do you believe in aliens?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.486
What do you mean, "aliens"?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.826
l'll sign that check, shall l?

07:31.910 --> 07:35.329
Get that out of your way.
Pizza grease on a map is the worst thing.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.501
We should turn in.
We got an early start in the morning.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.836
Yeah.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.212
What do you think
you're gonna dream about?

07:43.588 --> 07:47.174
Oh, the open road. High adventure.
That kind of thing.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.259
Mmm.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.469
- You?
- Wonder Woman.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.346
- Please don't.
- Okay.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.099
- You ready?
- Yeah.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.559
Okay. And...

07:56.643 --> 07:58.435
Three, two, one.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.191
What an amazing Con.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.860
That, my friend, was just the beginning.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.240
Here you go.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.491
That's not ours.

08:12.576 --> 08:13.701
No?

08:13.785 --> 08:16.370
No. That's ours.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.679
Fucking orcs!

08:57.329 --> 08:58.495
That one.

09:04.836 --> 09:05.836
Oh.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.379
Oh! People!

09:22.479 --> 09:23.771
Smile.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.692
"Watch the skies" or "Alien on board"?

09:30.403 --> 09:31.612
"Alien on board," please.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.573
Okay. lf you're sure.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.285
So, how was Comic-Con?

09:38.703 --> 09:40.120
We met Adam Shadowchild.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.456
Who the hell is Adam Shadowchild?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.708
Oh, hewrote The Venusian Pangenesis.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.043
l didn't read that one.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.045
Jenny Starpepper and the Great Brass Hen?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.129
No.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.422
The Robot's Mistress?

09:50.507 --> 09:51.715
l like romances.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.300
That's kind of a romance.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.928
- Between a woman and a machine?
- Yeah.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.721
l hear that.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.309
Do you get a lot of UFO types around here?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.104
Some.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.400
Do you believe?

10:09.484 --> 10:11.276
Oh, yes, l do.

10:11.778 --> 10:15.322
Been a lot of strange happenings
in these parts.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.075
Ah, it'd be a shame
if we were the only souls in the universe.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.828
Probability alone suggests not.

10:20.912 --> 10:24.581
You know, there are 200 billion galaxies
in the observable universe.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.542
Oh.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.043
Makes you think, doesn't it?

10:28.628 --> 10:29.670
What?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.922
Where is everybody?

10:37.012 --> 10:38.012
Boo!

10:39.055 --> 10:40.264
Oh.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.849
Gotcha.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.767
So, you fellows set
or can l get you something else?

10:43.852 --> 10:45.936
Oh, l think l would like
a refill of coffee, please, Pat.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.063
All right, then. How about you, pumpkin?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.899
Can l have an E.T. Malt, please?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.776
Mmm. You want that with a sparkler?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.030
Yeah.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.282
l will take that as a yes.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.744
l think l might do a toilet.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.458
Pretty funny.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.379
He's sitting right there on top of that bull,

11:12.464 --> 11:15.799
and he goes, "Cut her loose."

11:22.932 --> 11:24.224
What?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.102
l don't know you.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.395
Ooh.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.897
Comics.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.815
What was that about?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.817
How you think that makes me feel?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.071
Be rude to me?

11:38.656 --> 11:41.700
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.118
Ooh! Eggy,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.037
an alien just sicked up in my palms.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.246
Clive...

11:46.331 --> 11:47.623
What?

11:47.707 --> 11:48.916
- l'm joking.
- Stop it.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.960
They've got a soap dispenser in there
shaped like an alien's head. lt's brilliant!

11:52.045 --> 11:53.253
- Someone's here.
- What?

11:53.338 --> 11:55.380
Here it comes!

12:00.470 --> 12:01.553
What in...

12:06.351 --> 12:08.852
Hey, fellas! How you doing today?

12:08.937 --> 12:11.438
What is this, some kind of gay bar?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.690
No. Just a place
where you can get a bite to eat

12:13.775 --> 12:15.526
and maybe share a close encounter.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.569
Yeah. lt sounds like a gay bar.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.489
Oh, no, we're just friends.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.535
So, you guys look like
you could do with a couple beers.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.994
You go do that.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.913
All right. You do that.

12:29.791 --> 12:30.833
Yes.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.376
Get a sip. l'll get this.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.211
Just leave it.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.963
Thank you very much.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.302
What are you doing?

12:42.387 --> 12:44.304
Don't you put those queer eyes on me.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.848
l'm not. l forgot the sticker.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.307
What took you so long?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.309
- l was putting the sticker on.
- Oh.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.686
They were an odd pair, weren't they?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.772
Yeah, definitely not my kind of people.

12:53.857 --> 12:57.025
l doubt very much
we'll be seeing them again.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.402
Oh!

12:59.279 --> 13:01.488
- That wasn't their truck, was it?
- No.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.323
- Should l go and have a look?
- No!

13:20.008 --> 13:21.800
The Black Mailbox.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.011
Wow!

13:24.095 --> 13:26.597
This is probably the coolest thing
l've ever seen.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.473
Do you remember when we Googled it
on your mum's computer

13:28.558 --> 13:30.267
and the phone rang
and you thought it was the FBl?

13:30.351 --> 13:32.186
l didn't really think it was the FBl.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.271
- You started crying.
- l had jet lag.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.647
We'd only been to Brussels.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.816
Go stand next to it. Yep.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.693
Smile.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.780
Hey, imagine if we got buzzed by a craft.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.490
That would be amazing, wouldn't it?

13:45.575 --> 13:47.201
lt just hovers over us

13:47.285 --> 13:51.038
and then all the coins in our pockets
go magnetic, and then we get sunburned.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.414
Then it just goes up really quickly.

13:59.714 --> 14:00.881
Smile!

14:03.635 --> 14:05.385
What would you do if they actually landed?

14:05.470 --> 14:08.388
Well, first contact
is a big responsibility, isn't it?

14:08.473 --> 14:11.558
They come in peace, we go to pieces? Uh-uh.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.809
That's not how l roll.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.102
No.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.688
What's that?

14:23.780 --> 14:26.198
Do you think that's those men?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.075
No.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.037
We've seen enough.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.498
Let's go.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.999
Go, go, go!

14:40.964 --> 14:42.047
Oh, they're gaining.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.340
This is like Deliverance!

14:43.424 --> 14:45.092
They're going to rape us and break our arms!

14:45.176 --> 14:46.551
l don't want my arms broken!

14:48.429 --> 14:50.347
- l need the toilet.
- You've just been!

14:50.431 --> 14:51.640
You know l've got a child's bladder.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.395
Don't let them get past!

14:56.479 --> 14:58.563
- What do you want me to do, ram them?
- What about the deposit?

15:02.068 --> 15:04.444
- lt's not them! lt's not them!
- Ah!

15:04.529 --> 15:05.988
Oh, my God.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.906
That was awful!

15:07.991 --> 15:09.366
That was terrifying!

15:55.455 --> 15:56.830
Hello?

16:10.470 --> 16:13.055
- Maybe you should call for help.
- Yeah.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.643
lt's ringing.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.187
l wouldn't do that if l were you.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.870
Put the phone down.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.374
Oh, fuck me.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.336
- What have you done to him?
- l didn't do anything to him. He fainted.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.921
Yeah, but you made him faint!

16:46.005 --> 16:48.340
Yes. But it's not like
l set my phaser to "Faint."

16:48.424 --> 16:49.591
You've got a phaser?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.510
No, l don't... Look! Listen.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.970
Hey, l really need your help, okay?

16:54.055 --> 16:55.764
Can we get this guy back onto your wagon?

16:58.392 --> 16:59.601
Are you an alien?

17:00.103 --> 17:01.269
To you, l am, yes.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.521
Are you gonna probe us?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.689
Why does everyone always assume that?

17:04.773 --> 17:08.359
What am l doing? Am l harvesting farts?
How much can l learn from an ass?

17:08.444 --> 17:09.486
What?

17:09.904 --> 17:11.570
l'm sorry. What's your name?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.156
lt's Graeme Willy.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.657
And what's his name?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.159
That's the writer, Clive Gollings.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.828
Okay, cool! l'm Paul.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.204
Paul?

17:19.288 --> 17:21.330
Yeah. lt's a nickname that stuck.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.666
My ship crashed on a dog. lt doesn't matter!

17:23.751 --> 17:25.877
Look! Can we get the writer,
Clive Gollings, back on the RV

17:25.962 --> 17:27.420
and get the hell out of here, please?

17:27.505 --> 17:29.422
- l can't...
- l'm in a hell of a pickle,

17:29.507 --> 17:32.759
and if you don't help me,
l could die on this road tonight.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.387
l don't know.
We're on quite a tight schedule.

17:36.264 --> 17:40.433
Look, man.
Sometimes, you just gotta roll the dice.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.519
What do you say?

17:49.944 --> 17:52.279
- Okay.
- Okay! Perfect! Great!

17:52.363 --> 17:54.364
Okay, help me grab him.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.201
This man has peed his pants.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.120
Yeah, he's got a child's bladder.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.580
Oh, fantastic.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.142
Doesn't this thing go any faster?

18:22.226 --> 18:25.228
Well, l'm sorry, the speed limit is 70, so...

18:25.313 --> 18:29.482
Screw the speed limit! Actually, no.
Ooh, yeah. Don't screw it.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.652
That's good thinking. Okay?
Stay inconspicuous. That's good.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.196
How come l can understand you?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.448
Are you using some sort of
neural language router?

18:36.532 --> 18:39.201
Actually, l'm speaking English,
you fucking idiot.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.661
- That's not nice.
- That was mean.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.164
Look, l'm little tense.
l was just involved in a major car crash.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.373
That was your fault.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.918
l can't reach the pedals.
My legs are too little.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.295
l had to use the parking brake, okay?

18:50.922 --> 18:53.298
l'm sorry. You're in shock right now.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.135
l understand this must be
very weird for you.

18:57.220 --> 19:01.264
Just act normal and drive north, okay?

19:01.933 --> 19:04.935
We gotta get as much distance as we can
between us and the Big Guy.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.479
Zoil? What's happening?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.733
- He's gone.
- Shit!

19:54.193 --> 19:55.986
Looks like he hitched a ride, too.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.821
- What do you mean?
- Tire tracks.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.489
Bastard jacked a native?

19:59.573 --> 20:00.740
Could be two.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.243
Don't you think this is all
a bit of a coincidence?

20:03.577 --> 20:04.911
Are you suggesting he knew?

20:04.996 --> 20:06.621
Little fucker might have phoned home.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.749
There might even be a rescue party
on the way.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.419
Zoil, we need to break out the big guns.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.464
Do you think that that's wise?
The last thing we need is

20:16.549 --> 20:17.799
a hoo-ha.

20:18.259 --> 20:19.467
Maybe you're right.

20:19.552 --> 20:23.847
Listen, l got two rookies on a special mission
75 clicks north of you.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.432
l'll have them set up a roadblock.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.809
These are just civilians.
Why don't you let me take care of it?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.436
You might need the extra muscle.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.356
Just keep them in the dark.
l don't want any loose ends.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.443
These roads can be treacherous at night.

20:37.445 --> 20:41.156
People get into accidents all the time.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.908
l like your thinking. Get it done.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.794
Heads up. We just got reassigned.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.087
Nice.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.922
What about the sandwich?

20:58.007 --> 20:59.758
- She said we can share it.
- Oh, l love this job.

20:59.842 --> 21:00.925
Mmm-hmm.

21:19.737 --> 21:22.155
Man, l needed that.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.205
l love pistachios.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.082
l hate it when you get a closed one, right?

21:32.166 --> 21:34.584
l usually just bite them.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.002
No. You don't do that at all.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.421
You tap them, if they don't open
on their own, you throw them away.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.006
No, that's mussels.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.133
No, it's pistachios.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.427
- What the fuck?
- Clive, stop it! What are you doing?

21:44.512 --> 21:45.553
What are you?

21:47.640 --> 21:50.225
He's okay. He's fine. He's friendly.
His name's Paul.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.437
Aliens aren't called "Paul."

21:54.522 --> 21:57.774
Was that Klingon? You psychotic nerd!

21:57.858 --> 22:00.276
Paul is from a small M-class planet

22:00.361 --> 22:02.987
in the northern spiral arm
of the Andromeda Galaxy.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.239
Thank you.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.573
He looks too obvious.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.659
There's a reason for that, Clive.

22:07.743 --> 22:11.704
Over the last 60 years the human race
has been drip-fed images of my face

22:11.789 --> 22:13.998
on lunchboxes and T-shirts and shit.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.460
lt's in case our species do meet,
you don't have a fucking spaz attack!

22:17.545 --> 22:18.962
l did not have a spaz attack!

22:19.046 --> 22:21.548
- Don't do it again!
- That's my fucking jorph.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.968
Get your fucking fingers out of there!
lf l get a jorph infection, you're dead!

22:25.052 --> 22:27.137
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!

22:31.767 --> 22:33.143
Paul.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.519
Paul?

22:34.770 --> 22:38.857
Okay, okay. This could be it.
So, what are we looking for, again?

22:38.941 --> 22:40.108
l don't know.

22:45.239 --> 22:48.241
- What brings you to USA?
- We're on holiday.

22:48.451 --> 22:49.701
We've been to Comic-Con.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.078
Comic-Con? Don't tell O'Reilly.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.497
- He loves that dweeb shit.
- Oh.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.332
You guys know Benny Hill?

22:57.251 --> 22:58.751
- No.
- No.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.421
Oh, my God! Look at this!

23:01.505 --> 23:02.630
- What?
- Look at this!

23:02.715 --> 23:04.090
What?

23:04.550 --> 23:06.134
These guys have met Adam Shadowchild.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.970
Who the hell is Adam Shadowchild?

23:09.096 --> 23:11.139
Hewrote The Jupiter Praxis.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.515
What?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.642
Jenny Starpepper
and the Huge White Gibbon?

23:14.727 --> 23:15.727
Huh?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.020
Night of the Moths?

23:17.104 --> 23:19.606
Are you speaking English?
What are you talking about?

23:19.690 --> 23:22.192
Brilliant! What was he like?

23:22.276 --> 23:23.693
He was a bit intense.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.278
Well, he's an artist.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.490
Let me see this. What is this, nerd porn?

23:28.574 --> 23:30.700
- No, that's Clive's...
- lt's my novel.

23:30.784 --> 23:31.951
Okay.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.829
Ha. Three tits. That's awesome.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.499
You guys should have given her four tits.

23:38.292 --> 23:39.417
That's just sick.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.877
l was just saying.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.213
Hey, do you think this is it?

23:43.297 --> 23:44.881
Doubtful. What else did you find in there?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.883
Not much. Just some pissy jeans.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.469
- Clive's got a child's...
- Shut up.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.595
Sorry.

23:50.888 --> 23:53.515
- Okay. You guys can go.
- Thank you.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.059
Can l have my... Thank you very much.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.019
May l ask what you're searching for?

24:00.523 --> 24:01.564
No.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.817
Thank you. Come on, Graeme.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.447
Way to go, Dirty Harry!

24:09.532 --> 24:10.615
That was all right, right?

24:10.699 --> 24:13.326
- All right? That was great energy, man.
- Yeah. lt was.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.870
That's it... ls right.
lt was like... Not...

24:15.955 --> 24:18.164
- l thought it was okay.
- No, you're thinking about it too much.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.251
- You think so? Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, God. They were shaking in their boots.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.715
l think it's pretty obvious
what happened there, isn't it?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.467
ls it?

24:29.552 --> 24:32.595
The government used some kind of
neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.890
lt caused us to suffer
a shared hallucination about an alien.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.267
lt makes complete sense.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.768
Wrong!

24:39.770 --> 24:41.312
Oh!

24:46.610 --> 24:48.111
Your dick is gone.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.320
Hmm. Your balls are gone.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.156
Oh, no!

24:53.284 --> 24:54.867
What?

24:54.952 --> 24:57.453
Come on, grow up.
You guys seen my shorts?

24:57.538 --> 25:00.498
How did you do that?
How did you go invisible?

25:00.583 --> 25:02.667
Oh, it's a camouflage response.

25:02.751 --> 25:03.918
What, like, Predator?

25:04.003 --> 25:06.129
Exactly! Although l can only do it
while l'm holding my breath.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.589
But you can do it any time you want?

25:07.965 --> 25:09.007
Any time.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.634
That's just like him.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.680
Am l the only sane person here?

25:16.598 --> 25:17.640
Eh?

25:18.017 --> 25:21.102
lt's all right for you, isn't it?
You'll go back to Area 51.

25:21.186 --> 25:25.315
We'll be arrested for harboring a fugitive
and sent to Guantanamo Bay!

25:26.400 --> 25:28.693
Why don't l go make
some bagels and coffee?

25:28.777 --> 25:30.945
Leave you two alone.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.240
What's the matter, Clive?

25:35.617 --> 25:39.245
There is an alien in the kitchenette,
making bagels and coffee.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.040
- Did you want tea?
- No, l don't want tea!

25:42.124 --> 25:44.125
Right, because tea is weird in America.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.543
They leave the bag in.

25:45.627 --> 25:49.672
What's weird, Graeme, is the fact that we've
picked up an extraterrestrial hitchhiker

25:49.798 --> 25:51.883
and you seem completely fine with it!

25:51.967 --> 25:53.968
Bagels and coffee

25:54.053 --> 25:55.553
Ooh! Marmite!

25:56.138 --> 25:59.223
He said his life's in danger.
He needs our help, you know?

26:00.809 --> 26:02.935
Sometimes, you've just gotta roll the dice.

26:03.771 --> 26:09.025
What if we wake up and find him
inserting a probe into our anus?

26:09.818 --> 26:11.819
Apparently, they don't do that.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.447
Anyone want one of these?

26:15.157 --> 26:17.158
Eh? Anyone? Anyone?

26:17.910 --> 26:18.910
Eh?

26:25.584 --> 26:28.086
Forty-eight, 49, 50.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.296
Coming! Ready or not, you son of a bitch.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.013
- Where's the other one?
- l don't know, sir.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.600
Haggard!

26:42.684 --> 26:44.852
Sorry, it's just, we were...

26:45.521 --> 26:46.813
Haggard!

26:47.314 --> 26:48.356
Fuck.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.277
Nice.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.446
Get over here.
lt's a guy with a badge.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.199
We were just playing hide and seek,
because we had a lot of time.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.617
Hurry up!

26:59.701 --> 27:00.868
l was hiding.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.453
You have any traffic through here?

27:02.538 --> 27:07.625
No, just a couple of hillbilly types
and two nerds in an RV.

27:07.709 --> 27:08.751
Nerds, huh?

27:08.836 --> 27:11.712
Yes, they were coming from Comic-Con.
They met Adam Shadowchild.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.006
Who the hell is Adam Shadowchild?

27:14.591 --> 27:17.385
Hewrote Prisonhulk Four-Forty-One, okay?

27:17.469 --> 27:20.596
Jenny Starpepper and the Spitting Worm.
Fluxing Uranus.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.974
You know you're a grown man, right?

27:23.767 --> 27:26.644
Probably shave, pay taxes, have pubic hair?

27:26.728 --> 27:28.020
All of those things.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.814
- Did you search that vehicle?
- Yes, sir.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.524
- What did you find?
- Nothing much.

27:31.608 --> 27:36.612
Just a book with a green woman
with three titties.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.156
Titties. Three titties.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.699
Three tits. That's awesome.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.160
Oh, and some pissy jeans.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.370
- Guy pissed himself.
- Close that.

27:44.455 --> 27:45.955
l don't know if he had
a pre-existing problem or...

27:47.082 --> 27:48.207
Listen to me, Frik and Fuck.

27:48.292 --> 27:51.210
l want everything you can remember
about the pissy nerds, okay?

27:51.295 --> 27:52.628
We're leaving.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.964
What about the roadblock, sir?

27:55.048 --> 27:56.591
lt didn't work.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.303
We gotta take down that roadblock.
lt didn't work.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.471
l'm standing right next to you.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.822
Hey!

28:19.907 --> 28:22.158
Reese's Pieces! Yes!

28:22.242 --> 28:23.659
Thank you.

28:46.308 --> 28:49.519
l heard there was a commotion
on the road after Rachel.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.771
Funny, l didn't hear nothing.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.982
- lt must have been the boys out at the base.
- Yeah.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.108
Hey.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.654
- That's a bit much, isn't it?
- What?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.072
- Put it all back.
- Oh.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.116
Except the donuts and the chocolate milk.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.369
And the burritos, Cheetos and Fritos.

29:06.453 --> 29:10.122
- What about Paul's Reese's Pieces?
- Just hurry up. Please.

29:14.545 --> 29:15.795
No, you go right ahead.

29:15.879 --> 29:18.464
Are you sure? Thank you. Thank you.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.258
- That beast outside yours?
- What?

29:20.801 --> 29:23.469
- What do you mean "beast"?
- Your RV?

29:23.554 --> 29:25.555
Oh, the... Yes. The RV is...

29:25.639 --> 29:27.265
No... Yes.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.516
Where are you boys from?

29:29.309 --> 29:30.560
- England.
- England.

29:30.644 --> 29:33.145
l heard about England. No guns.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.148
- Not many.
- Not really.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.150
Just, you know, farmers.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.571
How are police supposed to shoot anybody?

29:43.365 --> 29:45.241
- They don't.
- They try not to.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.665
That'll be $15.58.

29:54.501 --> 29:58.963
$20. Just keep the change,
and give it to charity, or something.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.678
You did amazing, Graeme!

30:05.762 --> 30:07.638
That cop didn't suspect a thing!

30:07.723 --> 30:08.848
And, Clive,

30:09.349 --> 30:10.933
you didn't pee your pants.

30:11.018 --> 30:14.812
l don't mean to be a stick in the mud,
but you are asking a lot of us, all right?

30:14.896 --> 30:18.065
We've only just met,
we don't know where we're going, or why.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.109
You don't think we're due an explanation?

30:20.193 --> 30:23.070
Look, the less you guys know, the better.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.780
l want you to have plausible deniability.

30:25.991 --> 30:30.328
Let's just say l spent a long time
at that base thinking l was a guest.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.579
Turns out

30:31.663 --> 30:33.706
l was a prisoner.

30:33.790 --> 30:37.209
But don't worry. l got it all under...

30:44.134 --> 30:45.885
Fuck, that made me jump.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.219
Poor little thing!

30:47.304 --> 30:49.221
Nothing you could've done, mate.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.186
What you doing?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.021
Just watch.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.380
lt's a miracle!

31:25.634 --> 31:27.718
Man, l'm gonna miss these. Mmm.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.221
Why would you do that?

31:30.305 --> 31:32.515
l'm not going to eat a dead bird, am l?

31:36.144 --> 31:37.853
Going out of my mind

31:39.064 --> 31:41.899
You got me thinking that l'm wasting my time

31:42.109 --> 31:43.192
Don't bring me down

31:43.276 --> 31:44.276
Come on, guys!

31:44.361 --> 31:46.696
11 :00, 12:00! 11 :00, 12:00!

31:46.780 --> 31:47.780
Come on! lt's fun!

31:48.782 --> 31:51.367
lf you think about it, it's time travel.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.665
11 :00, 12:00!

31:58.166 --> 31:59.792
Yes! All right!

32:03.922 --> 32:06.257
- Let me see.
- No, just sit still.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.177
You gonna draw me
like one of your French girls, Jack?

32:12.681 --> 32:14.306
l'm joking. l'm sorry.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.727
Just don't make me look fat, okay?
Earth's gravity adds 10 pounds.

32:17.811 --> 32:20.563
Paul, could l ask you a question?

32:20.647 --> 32:21.814
Shoot!

32:22.899 --> 32:25.025
Have you ever done that to a person?

32:25.110 --> 32:27.403
Yes, l've eaten many people.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.280
l'm joking, big guy. Relax.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.323
No, l mean, fix them.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.492
Oh. No. Not a dead person.

32:33.577 --> 32:37.455
Recently dead bird? That's one thing.
Dead person? Whole other ball game.

32:37.539 --> 32:40.624
lt's actually really dangerous for me.
The damage can bounce back onto me and...

32:42.878 --> 32:45.421
Oh, l'm sorry. Am l boring you?
Have you heard this one before?

32:45.505 --> 32:47.465
Are you tired, Sausage?

32:47.924 --> 32:50.259
Don't call me that in front of him.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.011
Are you tired, though?

32:52.095 --> 32:54.054
Eggy, l'm bushed.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.056
You know what? We're all tired.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.100
Let's just pull over
and stop for the night, huh?

32:58.185 --> 32:59.769
We're fugitives, Paul, all right?

32:59.853 --> 33:03.939
l refuse to just sit around and wait
to get fingered by the Men in Black.

33:04.024 --> 33:08.110
We just gotta find somewhere quiet.
We won't draw attention to ourselves.

33:08.195 --> 33:10.279
But where are we going, Paul?

33:10.363 --> 33:12.740
Oh, you'll know it when you see it.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.035
- Two white guys?
- Two strange white guys.

33:16.119 --> 33:19.163
Strange white guys. Got it.
Order anything weird?

33:19.247 --> 33:20.372
Chocolate milk.

33:20.457 --> 33:23.083
Chocolate... Chocolate? Chocolate...

33:23.168 --> 33:24.710
Zoil, report.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.297
We've tracked him to a gas station in Ely.

33:28.381 --> 33:31.634
We think he may be traveling in an RV
with two men from England.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.719
New England?

33:33.804 --> 33:34.929
Old England.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.973
Creepy. What are they, Ml6?

33:38.850 --> 33:42.812
Negative. Just a couple of nerds
on the lam from Comic-Con.

33:42.896 --> 33:44.396
My sister's kid went to that.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.649
Little manga faggot.

33:46.733 --> 33:51.028
Zoil, something doesn't feel right.
l think he had help on the inside.

33:54.074 --> 33:55.449
l want those nerds iced

33:55.534 --> 34:00.079
and that little green prick
either back in his fishbowl or dead ASAP.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.622
l'm closing in. l can feel it.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.376
ln 24 hours he's gonna wish
he never set foot on planet Earth.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.669
Good.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.217
Okay. Here we are.
This is the place.

34:13.510 --> 34:14.760
Yeah, this looks good.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.847
lt doesn't look like
anyone's been murdered here.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.228
Awfully quiet.

34:24.312 --> 34:28.023
Quiet's good, Graeme. Quiet's our friend.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.484
Hi, there.

34:32.027 --> 34:33.112
There's a girl outside.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.701
Okay. All right. Look.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.870
We're just a couple of regular guys

34:40.954 --> 34:44.790
on a tour of the less touristy side
of the American Midwest.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.917
l don't think she heard you.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.418
l'm talking to you.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.670
Oh, sorry.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.215
Hi. l'm Ruth Buggs.

34:54.050 --> 34:57.511
Good evening, Ruth.
l am the writer, Clive Gollings.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.764
This is my friend and cohort,
Mr. Graeme Willy.

35:00.849 --> 35:01.891
Hi.

35:06.396 --> 35:07.730
Have you got room?

35:08.064 --> 35:10.190
Sure. Yeah, park in bay nine.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.610
lt's $25 a night, including hookups

35:12.694 --> 35:14.486
and l'll need an lD to hold onto.

35:14.571 --> 35:15.946
Okay.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.204
We're just a couple of regular guys

35:24.289 --> 35:27.875
on a tour of the less touristy side
of the American Midwest.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.501
- How exciting.
- l know.

35:30.503 --> 35:33.088
There you go. lt's my passport.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.468
The UK. l love the UK.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.345
- Have you been?
- No.

35:39.429 --> 35:40.429
You should go.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.182
Oh. Okay.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.851
No, no, l meant, you should go to London.

35:45.936 --> 35:48.520
There's a lot of places l want to go.

35:48.605 --> 35:51.190
Ruth! Ruth! Get in here!

35:51.274 --> 35:53.275
l'll be by in the morning to get your money

35:53.360 --> 35:54.944
so have a pleasant evening now, won't you?

35:55.028 --> 35:56.153
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.780
- Bye.
- And you. Bye.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.119
She was lovely.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.289
Why don't you just marry her, then?

36:07.666 --> 36:08.707
Boo!

36:08.792 --> 36:10.668
Every time, it works!

36:10.752 --> 36:13.128
That was 30 seconds ago, l did it.

36:18.343 --> 36:21.303
- What took you so long?
- l was just talking, Papa.

36:21.805 --> 36:24.264
Well, you talk too much.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.599
Sorry, Papa.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.066
Huh?

36:34.150 --> 36:35.818
Hello.

36:37.237 --> 36:40.531
- You want a cigarette?
- No, thanks. l don't smoke.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.953
- Can l ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.997
- You and Graeme, are you guys...
- What?

36:49.624 --> 36:52.084
You know...

36:54.796 --> 36:58.465
You know! You guys, two guys...

37:04.013 --> 37:05.264
Fucking kidding me?

37:15.150 --> 37:17.151
What are you...

37:20.405 --> 37:22.072
- l don't know what you mean.
- Gay!

37:22.157 --> 37:25.242
No! Why do people keep saying that?

37:25.326 --> 37:26.618
No, l was just wondering.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.122
lt's totally cool if you are.
Everyone's bi on my planet.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.374
lt's all about the pleasure thing.
You know what l'm saying?

37:34.043 --> 37:35.919
Why are you here, Paul?

37:36.004 --> 37:38.255
Oh, l was here on a science mission, actually,

37:38.339 --> 37:42.509
and then l had some
spaceship-related problems,

37:42.594 --> 37:45.512
and l kind of crashed.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.639
Lucky for me though,
this little girl,

37:47.724 --> 37:48.724
she pulls me out of the wreck.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.643
Next thing l know, guys arrive,
cart me off to the base.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.314
What have you been doing here
all this time?

37:56.274 --> 37:59.109
l've been kicking back, man.
l've been shooting the shit.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.111
l've been advising the government.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.362
Not just the government.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.617
l want him
to have some kind of a special power.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.869
Something messianic.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.539
Okay, Steven,
how about cellular revivification?

38:12.624 --> 38:14.041
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.876
Oh. Restoration of damaged tissue

38:15.960 --> 38:18.378
through telepathic manipulation
of intrinsic field memory.

38:18.463 --> 38:21.298
- What's that mean?
- lt means healing, Mr. Spielberg.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.966
Yeah, right. Healing.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.010
By touch, or something like that.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.888
Maybe his finger lights up at the end
when he reaches out and touches?

38:27.972 --> 38:30.724
Maybe. You know, sometimes
l find less is more.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.726
Hey. Trust me.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.604
You'd be surprised how much
he's influenced popular culture

38:35.688 --> 38:36.730
over the last 60 years.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.649
Agent Mulder was right.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.360
- Agent Mulder was my idea!
- Really?

38:41.444 --> 38:42.736
- Wow!
- Yeah!

38:42.821 --> 38:43.987
That's cool.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.741
Pump that shit, Earth-man. l like this song.
Mmm.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.034
Marvin's my boy.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.289
Come on. Break it down a bit, boys.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.583
Don't be afraid.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.127
Yeah, look at me, l'm breaking it down.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.091
Use them tongs.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.260
Dance with those tongs.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.928
Stoke the fire!

39:09.347 --> 39:10.514
Ooh! Ooh!

39:10.849 --> 39:12.015
Yes.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.520
Yee-haw!

39:31.786 --> 39:33.787
Ruth! Prayers!

39:35.039 --> 39:37.165
l don't know the words to this song.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.876
No one does!

39:40.503 --> 39:42.462
Hey! Guys, let's get fucked up.

39:49.554 --> 39:52.222
Oh, who's knocking? Stop it.

39:52.307 --> 39:55.017
- What are you doing?
- Oh, shut up.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.688
l'll hide in here.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.607
- Don't come out.
- Why would l come out?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.108
- Who is it?
- lt's Ruth.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.736
Ooh... Don't you dare open that door.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.112
- Hi.
- Hello.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.323
Good morning. May l come in?

40:09.407 --> 40:13.285
- No. l don't think you should come in.
- Yeah. Make yourself at home.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.954
- l'm not really dressed.
- Sure. ln you come.

40:16.039 --> 40:17.664
Oh, was everything okay?

40:17.749 --> 40:22.252
- Yes it was. lt was very nice. The best. Ever.
- Yes, thank you. Adequate.

40:22.337 --> 40:23.670
So, where's the other one?

40:24.380 --> 40:26.632
The other one? lt's just...

40:26.716 --> 40:29.217
Oh, oh.
lt's okay, we don't charge by the person.

40:29.302 --> 40:32.971
There were three shadows l saw
dancing around the RV last night, right?

40:33.056 --> 40:35.557
- The other one. The other one.
- Oh... He...

40:35.642 --> 40:38.727
l'm in the can. l ate a closed pistachio.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.355
l'm paying for it.

40:43.316 --> 40:46.902
- That's a nice T-shirt.
- Oh, thanks. l got it at my church.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.780
lt's Jesus shooting Charles Darwin.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.199
Why would Jesus
want to shoot Charles Darwin?

40:52.283 --> 40:55.494
Because of his blasphemous theories.

40:55.578 --> 40:56.703
Are you men of God?

41:01.626 --> 41:03.710
We're men of science, you know.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.880
We believe in the establishment
of a biological order

41:06.965 --> 41:09.549
through the maelstrom
of physical and chemical chaos.

41:10.426 --> 41:13.679
God created the Earth in six days,
and on the seventh day he rested.

41:13.763 --> 41:14.972
Really?

41:16.891 --> 41:19.893
Or it could be God. You don't know, do you?
lt's up in the air.

41:19.978 --> 41:24.147
The world is 4,000 years old and can only
be the product of intelligent design.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.941
- Oh, that's horseshit.
- Oh!

41:27.610 --> 41:29.778
All right, well, then,

41:29.862 --> 41:33.573
please explain how something
as complex as the human eye

41:33.658 --> 41:35.409
simply just comes into being.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.662
Oh, don't give me that old
irreducible complexity crap.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.707
Something as intricate as that
does not just occur

41:41.791 --> 41:44.001
without the intervention of a guiding hand.

41:44.085 --> 41:45.711
lt didn't just occur!

41:45.795 --> 41:48.255
lt is the culmination
of billions of years of development

41:48.339 --> 41:50.841
across countless fucking species.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.467
What are you talking about?

41:52.552 --> 41:54.720
- Evolution, baby.
- Oh!

41:55.179 --> 41:57.222
- Blasphemy!
- Oh, yeah.

41:57.306 --> 42:01.309
Nothing that you can say or do
can shake my belief or faith

42:01.394 --> 42:04.021
in the sure and certain knowledge
that God made heaven and earth

42:04.105 --> 42:05.939
and created us all in His own image.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.357
- Oh, his own image?
- Yeah.

42:07.442 --> 42:09.443
Well, l got a question.

42:10.653 --> 42:11.987
How do you explain me?

42:13.614 --> 42:15.782
She's going, she's falling. Catch...

42:17.201 --> 42:18.827
And that's Jenga.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.581
- Why did you do that?
- She fainted!

42:22.665 --> 42:23.832
We've gone through this! They faint!

42:23.916 --> 42:25.333
But we're going to have to
take her with us now!

42:25.418 --> 42:27.127
No! No!

42:27.211 --> 42:30.672
This is America. Kidnapping a Christian?
That's worse than harboring a fugitive.

42:30.757 --> 42:33.884
But she's seen you.
lf we leave her, she's going to call the police!

42:34.010 --> 42:36.928
Who gives a shit? No one's going to
believe this God-bothering Cyclops.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.765
Let's just dump her on the road!
Just roll her up in the rug.

42:39.849 --> 42:43.226
We can't risk that! lf we take her with us,
then we can get her on our side!

42:43.352 --> 42:45.228
You'd love to get her on her side,
wouldn't you?

42:45.313 --> 42:46.772
That doesn't make sense.

42:46.856 --> 42:49.399
Look. She'll be fine. We're quite nice.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.526
All right. What about my passport?

42:52.695 --> 42:55.071
Oh, God! You guys.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.078
Mmm-hmm.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.541
No!

43:19.055 --> 43:21.681
Oh, shit.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.643
Ruth, what in the Lord's name...

43:24.727 --> 43:26.937
- Morning.
- Morning.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.401
Go, go, go!

43:37.406 --> 43:38.573
Oh, fuck.

43:39.408 --> 43:41.284
Show yourself, demon!

43:42.161 --> 43:43.620
Where are you? Where are you?

43:43.704 --> 43:44.955
Passport! Passport!

43:45.289 --> 43:46.373
Jump! Jump!

43:51.546 --> 43:53.505
What? That's actually small on my planet.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.152
Ruth?

44:17.655 --> 44:20.031
Hello, Ruth, would you like a cup of tea?

44:22.118 --> 44:23.994
Where am l?

44:25.413 --> 44:26.538
Hey, look who's awake.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.707
Demon! Demon!

44:28.791 --> 44:31.543
We're sorry.
We're not going to hurt you, l promise.

44:31.627 --> 44:33.545
And we'll let you go just as soon as we can.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.006
You've been deceived
by an agent of Satan himself.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.133
- He's evil!
- l'm sitting right here, come on!

44:38.217 --> 44:42.262
No, he's not evil, he's just a bit rude.
We're trying to help him get home.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.847
He's from another world.

44:43.931 --> 44:47.893
There's only one world, our world!
The world that our God, the Father, created!

44:47.977 --> 44:49.477
lf it makes you feel any better

44:49.562 --> 44:51.521
my existence
only disproves traditional notions

44:51.606 --> 44:53.231
of the Abrahamic, Judeo-Christian God,

44:53.316 --> 44:55.817
as well as all one-world theologies.
That's all l meant.

44:55.902 --> 45:00.071
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound

45:00.156 --> 45:01.907
You can't win with these people!

45:01.991 --> 45:05.577
Ruth, just listen to me, for one second.
Please, if you could just calm down.

45:05.661 --> 45:08.997
l can't drive like this.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.043
She's talking in tongues now? Fuck this.

45:24.513 --> 45:25.680
Oh.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.559
What did you do to her?

45:29.644 --> 45:31.645
l just transferred
my collective knowledge and experience

45:31.729 --> 45:33.521
via a tactile psychokinetic bridge.

45:33.606 --> 45:34.898
Ooh, wow, could you do me?

45:34.982 --> 45:36.608
lt really takes it out of me.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.109
Oh, go on, please.

45:42.448 --> 45:43.531
Oh, wow!

45:44.033 --> 45:46.034
Oh, yeah.

45:46.118 --> 45:48.036
He always knew what was going on
in Battlestar before me

45:48.120 --> 45:49.120
'cause his mum had cable.

45:49.205 --> 45:50.956
Fine, pull over. l'll do you.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.124
Absolutely not. No spoilers.

45:55.586 --> 45:58.380
l didn't call the government.
l called the police!

45:58.464 --> 46:01.424
This is not the police's area of expertise,
Mr. Buggs.

46:02.385 --> 46:05.428
- That devil took my daughter.
- What do you mean, devil?

46:05.513 --> 46:07.806
And your daughter's name is Ruth, is it?

46:07.890 --> 46:11.518
That's right. l brought her up
by myself after her mama died.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.269
Do you have a photograph of Ruth, sir?

46:13.354 --> 46:15.063
Yeah. She's pretty easy to spot.

46:15.147 --> 46:18.566
She's had this eye thing
since she was four years old.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.111
Didn't want to take her
to a doctor for that?

46:21.570 --> 46:23.613
The good Lord is the only doctor
she'll ever need.

46:23.698 --> 46:25.991
Copy that. Do you have a phone here

46:26.075 --> 46:28.743
that your daughter might try to
reach you at if she decides to call?

46:28.828 --> 46:30.120
Yeah, in the back.

46:30.496 --> 46:34.207
Hey, Peter Parker. Want to put the snappy
down and get to the phone?

46:34.291 --> 46:35.709
Right.

46:36.168 --> 46:37.460
She'll call me if she can.

46:38.754 --> 46:40.797
- You mentioned they went east?
- That's right.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.924
They'll get off the 191 after Flaming Gorge

46:43.009 --> 46:44.175
if they ain't on the interstate.

46:44.260 --> 46:45.969
There's been a big-rig spill...

46:48.264 --> 46:51.266
Here we go. Boys, to the car.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.728
Thank you very, very much for your time, sir.

46:56.063 --> 46:59.399
Promise me you'll kill that thing, Mr. Zoil.
Kill it for what it is.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.401
We're gonna do our best.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.528
- l've seen its eyes.
- Mmm-hmm.

47:03.612 --> 47:04.946
lt's evil.

47:06.782 --> 47:09.159
Godspeed, Mr. Zoil.

47:10.619 --> 47:12.704
First 48 are crucial.

47:14.832 --> 47:17.542
Sir, you mind telling us
what we're looking for?

47:17.626 --> 47:18.793
Yeah, what are we looking for?

47:18.878 --> 47:21.171
l told you this is a need-to-know operation.

47:21.797 --> 47:23.840
Yes, sir, but...

47:25.301 --> 47:26.718
Damn it.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.472
Sir, l think it's time you tell us.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.516
Hey, just do
what the fuck l tell you, Haggard.

47:33.601 --> 47:38.313
Now let's go find that crazy old bastard's
little girl before it's too late.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.320
Ruth!

47:46.155 --> 47:47.238
Ruth, wait!

47:47.323 --> 47:48.573
Leave me alone!

47:48.657 --> 47:50.492
Please, please, stop. l've got shin splints.

47:53.704 --> 47:56.998
He cannot be from space! lt's not possible.

47:57.083 --> 47:58.416
He's from somewhere else.

47:58.501 --> 48:01.586
Ruth, you saw it for yourself, okay?
He showed you.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.963
There's probably billions
of intelligent civilizations out there.

48:04.048 --> 48:06.591
So where is everybody? Hmm?

48:07.468 --> 48:08.968
But one of them's there!

48:09.053 --> 48:10.845
Are they looking? Are they looking?

48:10.930 --> 48:12.806
Are they looking right now?

48:12.890 --> 48:14.182
Sorry.

48:16.435 --> 48:18.353
That's pathetic.

48:20.314 --> 48:21.981
What's your beef, Clive?

48:22.066 --> 48:23.775
l don't have a beef.

48:26.237 --> 48:29.447
l'm from outer space.
You're a science-fiction writer.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.199
We should be best buds.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.326
lt's not you.

48:34.662 --> 48:36.037
lt's me.

48:40.543 --> 48:43.294
ls that what this is? You're jealous? Of her?

48:45.256 --> 48:46.297
lt's not just that.

48:47.883 --> 48:48.967
Whoa.

48:49.385 --> 48:50.885
Of me?

48:51.679 --> 48:53.721
This is because me and Graeme

48:53.806 --> 48:55.807
got two minutes of face-time
while you were sleeping?

48:55.891 --> 48:58.977
- ls that what this is?
- l wanted this to be special, you know?

48:59.061 --> 49:01.938
l have dreamt about meeting you

49:02.022 --> 49:04.607
ever since l saw Mac and Me.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.317
And l blew it.

49:06.402 --> 49:09.362
Now you two are friendly,
and he's off talking to girls

49:09.446 --> 49:11.865
and it's like, where am l?

49:11.949 --> 49:13.491
Come on, man.

49:13.576 --> 49:15.994
This is special.

49:16.078 --> 49:20.248
You guys being all nerdy and shit
and meeting me. That is fate.

49:20.332 --> 49:23.209
Who cares if you pissed your pants, man?

49:23.794 --> 49:26.754
When l first got here,
first time l saw a human, l puked.

49:27.923 --> 49:29.716
You guys are weird looking.

49:29.800 --> 49:33.094
You have giant bodies.
You have tiny, little, tiny heads.

49:33.179 --> 49:36.514
- You're just being nice now.
- No.

49:36.599 --> 49:38.349
Look, you want a little sugar?

49:40.811 --> 49:42.687
lt's just knowledge and experience, man.

49:42.771 --> 49:45.398
You're a writer.
Might give you some inspiration.

49:45.482 --> 49:46.733
Will it hurt?

49:47.318 --> 49:49.110
Only if you struggle.

49:49.778 --> 49:50.945
All right.

49:56.952 --> 49:59.871
So, everything that l have been told
my whole life

49:59.955 --> 50:01.623
is just a big fat lie.

50:02.958 --> 50:04.334
Do you know how that feels?

50:05.586 --> 50:09.047
Just because your truth isn't a true truth
doesn't mean that there is no truth, Ruth.

50:09.131 --> 50:11.633
- That's easy for you to say.
- lt's really not.

50:11.717 --> 50:17.222
So there's no heaven.
No hell, no right, no wrong, no sin?

50:17.306 --> 50:18.556
Well...

50:19.266 --> 50:21.434
- l can drink?
- lf you like.

50:21.518 --> 50:24.020
- l can fornicate?
- Maybe.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.189
- l can curse?
- Well, yeah.

50:26.273 --> 50:27.732
- Penises!
- Ruth.

50:27.816 --> 50:31.402
Assing, hairy boobs, poop-farting buttholes!

50:31.487 --> 50:33.071
Ruth, l'm not sure this is helping.

50:34.406 --> 50:35.949
What are you doing?

50:36.033 --> 50:38.743
- Stop it!
- Why? Why should l stop?

50:41.997 --> 50:43.206
This is not...

50:45.125 --> 50:49.754
Because you have your whole life
to explore new things.

50:49.838 --> 50:51.089
Okay?

50:51.173 --> 50:55.009
lt doesn't necessarily mean
you should be exploring mine right now.

50:58.847 --> 51:03.101
You said you wanted to travel,
to see new stuff? This is your chance.

51:03.185 --> 51:06.437
l really think you should come with us.

51:06.522 --> 51:07.605
Where would l sleep?

51:07.690 --> 51:10.608
l'll sleep on the sofa.
And then you can have my bed.

51:10.693 --> 51:14.570
But l'd push the tissues off with a pen,
if l were you, because l've had a cold.

51:15.281 --> 51:16.281
Oh.

51:22.830 --> 51:25.415
Ruth has decided
that she would like to come with us.

51:27.459 --> 51:28.501
Wicked.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.838
l'm gonna go freshen up.

51:31.922 --> 51:35.300
Hey, Ruth. Wait up.

51:35.384 --> 51:37.051
You don't smoke.

51:37.136 --> 51:38.594
l just wanted to say thanks.

51:38.679 --> 51:41.139
l know this has been weird for you,

51:41.223 --> 51:44.809
but you saved my life
and l owe you one, okay?

51:44.893 --> 51:46.185
Okay.

51:46.895 --> 51:49.188
What have you got there, by the way?

51:49.273 --> 51:53.484
Severe epiretinal membrane complicated by
macular edema in your left vitreous cavity?

51:53.569 --> 51:54.944
How did you know that?

51:55.404 --> 51:56.779
Lucky guess.

51:56.864 --> 51:59.032
Do you mind if l take a look at it
for one second?

52:04.747 --> 52:08.416
What does it say in the Old Testament?
"An eye for an eye"?

52:09.043 --> 52:11.669
- Wait, l don't...
- lt's okay. You can trust me.

52:11.754 --> 52:14.922
- l don't know...
- Just have a little faith, okay?

52:39.990 --> 52:41.616
Oh!

52:44.078 --> 52:45.495
How did you do that?

52:46.455 --> 52:48.998
Evolution, baby.

52:56.215 --> 52:58.049
- Graeme?
- Yeah?

53:00.177 --> 53:02.303
Oh, my God. Clive.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.389
Oh, my God.

53:21.949 --> 53:24.450
What are you going to do?
Come on. Make your move.

53:24.535 --> 53:25.785
Oh, shit. Damn it.

54:00.696 --> 54:02.947
Hey, check it out! Check it out!

54:03.365 --> 54:04.407
Huh?

54:04.491 --> 54:06.117
This is easy.

54:07.703 --> 54:10.413
Small corrections, Paul.
Just make small corrections.

54:10.497 --> 54:12.165
Graeme, hit the brakes!

54:24.470 --> 54:26.471
Hey, there, sleepy face!

54:26.555 --> 54:30.766
Fuckeroo. That was the best
titty-farting sleep l have ever had.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.645
l got a feeling
that you're new to cursing, Ruth.

54:34.730 --> 54:38.566
Look, cursing's fun.
You just gotta pick your moments, okay?

54:38.650 --> 54:41.402
Maybe we should stop for some food.
ls anybody hungry?

54:41.487 --> 54:42.778
- Fuck, yeah!
- Ruth?

54:42.863 --> 54:45.364
You bet your big, fat cock l am!

54:45.449 --> 54:46.782
Nice!

54:46.867 --> 54:48.493
l'm starving.

54:48.577 --> 54:50.203
What's new, fatty?

54:51.580 --> 54:53.664
- lt's not fat, Paul, it's power.
- Fat power.

54:53.749 --> 54:55.041
- So rude.
- You're rude.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.167
Maybe l should call my dad.

54:56.251 --> 54:58.544
- What?
- What? Why?

54:58.629 --> 54:59.754
l've been gone for a whole day

54:59.838 --> 55:03.007
and if he calls the police,
they're gonna be looking for us.

55:03.091 --> 55:05.676
lf l don't, there's a good chance
we could all end up in Shit-Butt City.

55:06.261 --> 55:07.720
You're really getting the hang of this.

55:07.804 --> 55:09.055
Thanks, dick milk.

55:40.921 --> 55:44.090
- l won't be long.
- Okay. Be careful.

56:00.482 --> 56:02.275
- Ruth Buggs?
- Yes?

56:02.359 --> 56:05.736
Listen to me carefully.
l want you to tell me where you are.

56:05.821 --> 56:06.904
Who is this?

56:07.489 --> 56:09.115
My name is Agent Zoil,

56:09.199 --> 56:11.075
and it's very important that you tell me
where you are

56:11.159 --> 56:12.994
and where you are headed, Ms. Buggs.

56:13.245 --> 56:14.996
l can't tell you.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.498
l mean, l don't know.

56:17.582 --> 56:19.250
You've been abducted.

56:19.334 --> 56:22.378
And the individual that you're traveling with
is highly dangerous.

56:22.462 --> 56:24.255
Oh, no, he's not dangerous.

56:24.339 --> 56:27.008
I mean, he's kind of rude, he curses a Iot,

56:27.092 --> 56:30.761
and a couple times
l've seen him scratch his spaceman balls.

56:33.348 --> 56:36.267
Please listen to me.
Your father is extremely worried about you

56:36.351 --> 56:38.394
and we'd like to get you home, Ms. Buggs.

56:39.438 --> 56:40.813
He showed me things.

56:40.897 --> 56:42.898
She's talking about his spaceman balls.

56:42.983 --> 56:44.859
You know l'm just trying to help you,
right, Ruth?

56:45.277 --> 56:48.321
l don't know what's real anymore.
l'm confused.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.448
- We got the bitch!
- Yeah, dog! Up high!

56:50.532 --> 56:52.408
Damn it, Haggard! Miss...

56:56.038 --> 56:57.163
Hey.

56:57.247 --> 56:59.332
Whoa, slow down there, baby.

56:59.416 --> 57:01.292
- Excuse me, l have to get to my friends.
- Oh.

57:01.376 --> 57:04.420
l got a friend down here
that would love to meet you.

57:05.630 --> 57:06.881
Me, too.

57:08.884 --> 57:10.843
Well, as much as l would like
to meet your penises,

57:10.927 --> 57:12.261
l'm in a hurry, so excuse me.

57:12.346 --> 57:14.388
Now, this won't take long, sugar.

57:14.473 --> 57:16.932
Nope. Won't take long at all.

57:17.017 --> 57:20.478
Well, since you're both being so romantic,
maybe l could

57:20.562 --> 57:22.355
give it just a quick hello.

57:22.439 --> 57:24.231
What the fuck? Shit!

57:24.316 --> 57:25.816
Now, why would you even...

57:25.901 --> 57:26.984
Ow! My balls!

57:28.487 --> 57:30.071
- Hey.
- Hey, how's your dad?

57:30.155 --> 57:31.947
- We gotta go.
- What about the mini pizzas?

57:32.032 --> 57:33.449
- We gotta go now!
- No, you don't!

57:33.533 --> 57:35.409
Holy shit!

57:36.453 --> 57:39.372
lt's the space faggots
that dinged the fuck-mobile!

57:39.456 --> 57:41.499
- Yeah. We were just leaving.
- l don't feel well.

57:41.583 --> 57:43.751
- l don't think so.
- Leave her alone!

57:44.336 --> 57:46.003
Oh, shit! Sailors!

57:46.088 --> 57:47.963
- Let's go.
- Sorry!

57:49.424 --> 57:50.424
Excuse me, miss.

57:52.052 --> 57:53.094
Papa?

57:55.555 --> 57:58.265
Ruth? My Lord! Your eye!

57:59.476 --> 58:01.685
- Let's go!
- What about my dad?

58:01.770 --> 58:02.978
Let's go, boy!

58:07.776 --> 58:09.360
Where you going, girls?

58:09.444 --> 58:11.904
Leave us alone, you stupid vaginas!

58:11.988 --> 58:14.782
That's no way for a pretty little thing
like you to talk!

58:14.866 --> 58:15.950
She's fairly new to it, to be honest.

58:16.034 --> 58:18.702
Leave this to me. l'll talk to them.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.168
Yo, fucknuts!

58:26.253 --> 58:27.962
lt's probing time.

58:28.755 --> 58:29.713
Oh.

58:32.300 --> 58:34.802
Ha! Only one of us fainted.

58:35.137 --> 58:36.971
Oh, shit! The five-O! Let's bounce.

58:37.055 --> 58:39.306
l'm sorry. They answered the phone.

58:39.850 --> 58:41.058
They knew about us.

58:42.477 --> 58:44.228
Get in the RV.

58:44.312 --> 58:47.106
- Come on, they're going to wake up!
- Hurry!

58:51.403 --> 58:52.570
Sorry!

58:53.780 --> 58:55.614
Okay. We need to get off the road.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.575
- Shouldn't we keep moving?
- No.

58:57.659 --> 58:59.743
That is exactly what they'll expect us to do.

58:59.828 --> 59:03.205
Trust me.
Only an idiot would stop right now.

59:03.665 --> 59:06.167
- Yeah, pull in here. Perfect.
- What? Paul.

59:06.251 --> 59:08.127
We're idiots, remember?

59:21.683 --> 59:23.267
What should we do now?

59:24.144 --> 59:25.811
How about a hot chocolate and bed?

59:25.896 --> 59:27.271
What are you, my grandma?

59:27.355 --> 59:30.316
Oh, l couldn't sleep. l'm too pumped.

59:30.400 --> 59:33.319
Yeah, me, too. Let's get some beers.
Find somewhere to chill.

59:33.403 --> 59:34.612
What do you say?

59:34.696 --> 59:36.113
What if someone sees you?

59:36.198 --> 59:37.823
lt's dead out there. And l can do this.

59:40.494 --> 59:41.911
Okay. l'm in.

59:41.995 --> 59:43.579
- Rocky?
- Sure.

59:43.663 --> 59:45.080
Bullwinkle?

59:45.165 --> 59:46.790
l'm a little bit tired.

59:46.875 --> 59:48.083
Don't be a pussy.

59:48.168 --> 59:49.877
Don't call me a...

59:50.629 --> 59:51.670
All right.

59:54.674 --> 59:56.509
Just get your hands off me!

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:07.019
Hoss?

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.064
Something l can help you with?

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:13.192
Yeah. You mind telling me
what happened here?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.819
Just a good old-fashioned
beer-soaked slobberknocker.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.404
See anything unusual?

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:22.618
A couple hillbilly types in the back
of that meat wagon won't stop crying.

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:31.669
Have you gentlemen seen
anything unusual this evening?

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:33.170
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:35.506
Are we sure?

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:37.174
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.220
- Thank you.
- No sweat.

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:55.609
- lt's a nice window.
- lt's a little cowboy, isn't it?

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.862
That's funny.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:04.118
l'll tell you what else is funny,
was when you kissed me yesterday.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.912
- Sorry.
- No. lt's not...

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:11.292
l was like, "Get off me, you rapist."

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:17.590
- Do it again, if you like.
- What?

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:19.842
l said you can do it again, if you like.

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:23.262
Really?

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:26.140
lf you're gonna try it, then maybe
you should do it with a friend,

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.017
rather than someone like a stranger

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:30.102
because there's a lot of weirdos out there.

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:33.272
l am planning on doing a lot of kissing
and fornicating

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.941
so you'd really be helping me out.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.651
- Great.
- Okay.

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:40.237
- What, now?
- No, l thought you meant...

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:41.989
No, l did. Let's do it now.

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:44.366
- l mean...
- Yeah, all right.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:45.993
Put my hands on you.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:47.953
Just stand here? Okay.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.413
Hold you steady.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.252
Fuck!

01:01:55.337 --> 01:01:58.297
l'm sorry. l thought l was gonna pass out.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.632
Carry on.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.718
- What's happening?
- Nothing, just hanging around.

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:06.555
They were about to make out.
lt was awkward.

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:08.432
We were just...

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:12.811
Good. Please put your shorts on, Paul.

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:19.276
You guys partake?

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.028
No, thank you.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:23.113
l'll partake.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.992
Are you sure?
lt's pretty strong shit.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:29.828
l got it from the military, actually.
This is the stuff that killed Dylan.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.163
Bob Dylan's not dead.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.123
lsn't he?

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.377
Hit me.

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:39.213
Okay. Just go easy on it.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:40.756
Ruth.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.633
Just a little bit. Little bit.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:53.811
lt's not so bad.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.480
To be fair,
it takes a while to be absorbed into...

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:57.856
Oh, shit.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:06.031
l'm hungry.
We should cook up some sausages.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.991
- Do we have any sausages?
- Uh...

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.660
- What do you mean by that?
- No.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:13.080
Why do you guys hate me?
Can we cook up some sausages?

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:15.833
Ooh, l have wasps in my brain!

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:21.463
She'll be fine.
That happened to me the first time.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:24.174
Paul.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:27.678
l was wanting to ask.
You know us now, right?

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:31.682
Yeah. Graeme, we're bona fide BFFs.

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.394
Why are you in such a hurry to leave now?

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:42.443
Well, according to the government,
l've fulfilled my usefulness.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.194
l told them everything l know.

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:47.906
The only thing l have left
to offer them now are my abilities.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.744
The healing, the thought transfer,
the camouflage.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:55.497
ln order to cultivate those abilities,
they need some of my stem cells.

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:57.750
And l'm not really down with that.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.794
Lucky for me,
l do have one friend left on the inside.

01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:03.255
So, l managed to get an SOS
beamed into space.

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:06.467
l got my people primed
and ready to pick me up.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.428
Then, motherfuckers brought
the procedure forward by a day,

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:10.971
my whole plan goes to shit.

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:12.139
What happened?

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:16.518
On the way to the mental labs, l zapped
my escort, l stole his car, l took off.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.312
Found you guys.

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.439
So what happens if you get caught?

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:24.234
Graeme, they're gonna cut out my brain.

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:26.069
Oh.

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:29.156
Yeah. lt's fucked.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.366
lt's kind of a buzz-kill.

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:34.536
Let's lighten the mood, shall we?
Clive, when did you last get laid?

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:37.831
Oh. Mmm.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:42.419
- Collectormania, London, '08.
- '08.

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:43.796
Ewok chick.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.548
Clive likes boning space bears!

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:48.425
Shut up.

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:51.595
No, but seriously, be honest with me.

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:52.763
What was it like?

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.183
Well, she was furry nice.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:00.813
That's disgusting! That's gross.

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:08.362
Hey, Clive.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:10.614
No, Boomer, it's forbidden.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.658
Hey, Clive.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.201
- Hey!
- Clive!

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:16.745
Let's go, guys! We gotta get out of here!

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:24.920
Where's Ruth?

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:27.464
She went back to the RV.

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:30.759
Of course!

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.928
He can read minds.

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.054
Come on.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:39.643
Guys, l think we have a slight problem
over here.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:43.981
Oh, man.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:48.193
l can't hold my breath
the whole way through town.

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:50.904
Wait here.

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:55.158
What? Wait!

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:07.129
Good morning. Agent Zoil, Secret Service.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.256
You mind if l come in there
and ask a few questions?

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.757
Not at all.

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:18.557
Morning.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:25.772
- Why are we holding hands?
- So we look like a family.

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.691
Yeah, the fucking Friedmans.

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:28.984
You could be a midget.

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:30.903
- You're obsessed with midgets!
- No, l'm not!

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:33.697
Stop it! Just act normal.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:37.951
We're just a couple of regular guys walking
down the street with a small cowboy.

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:39.119
All right, Clive?

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.746
Clive?

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.998
- Clive.
- Oh, come on!

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:49.922
Clive, what are you doing?

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.423
Yeah, man, what the fuck?

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:52.633
l want it.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:56.845
l can appreciate it's a bargain, but this is
not Comic-Con now. This is reality.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.932
lt's false economy anyway,
it'll break the first time you use it. Let's go!

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:02.392
- Why would l ever use it?
- Can we just go, please?

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:04.978
Wait. Maybe we should go inside.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:06.605
- What?
- We'll hide out.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.775
You go back and get Ruth.
Get the RV, pick us up in 10 minutes.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:10.901
You sure?

01:07:12.236 --> 01:07:13.445
Trust me.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.620
Good morning.
My name is Agent Zoil, Secret Service.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.997
Mind if l come in, ask you a few questions?

01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:26.583
Do you mind if we just do it right here?

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:27.668
Okay.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:30.629
This place is a real cock-sucking mess.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:32.798
Got it.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:37.761
l'm telling you,
we're looking for a goddamn alien.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:40.389
l thought all that Project Blue Book stuff
was horseshit.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:41.848
No, it all makes sense.

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:43.642
All this hush-hush crap?

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.227
- The drawing that l found?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.729
What do you think that girl
was talking about last night?

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.856
Holy shit! Spaceman balls!

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:52.526
Yeah. And who has spaceman balls?

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.486
- Buzz Aldrin?
- Be serious.

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:05.580
Hello, handsome.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.041
ls that you?

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:09.668
Uh, huh?

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:11.128
ls that you on the cover?

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:14.423
No.

01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:16.675
- What's your name?
- Keith Nash.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:20.470
- Nice to meet you. l'm Paul.
- Right.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.973
So, you're not freaked out by me?

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.892
- Hmm. Yes and no.
- Huh.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.437
You mind taking a look
at these photographs?

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.898
Tell me if you recognize either one
of these two gentlemen or the one-eyed girl?

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.109
- Ma'am?
- No.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.112
Anything? Anything at all?

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:38.822
Mmm-mmm.

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:41.742
- You really think this is an alien?
- Yeah!

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:45.620
- This is huge! This is huge!
- l know! l know!

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:47.413
ls that a comic book shop?

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:48.999
Can we go in there?

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.417
Maybe. lf you're good.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.002
Where are you coming from?

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.254
Austin.

01:08:54.337 --> 01:08:56.965
- Good town.
- Yeah, it is. They have a lot of bats.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.716
Sorry? What'd you say?

01:08:58.801 --> 01:08:59.801
Mmm-mmm.

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:02.136
Okay. Thanks for your time, Mrs...

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.513
Darwin.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.350
Charlotte Darwin.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.269
Charlotte Darwin. You have a great day.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.361
You are not gonna believe this.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.281
You should get this one.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.033
- Thanks.
- Yeah, it's good.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:28.622
Nice! l like your style, Keith Nash.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:30.372
- l gotta go.
- Catch you later.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:31.875
Bye, Paul.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:33.042
Don't get caught.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.337
Happy trails.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.506
Eh?

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:43.886
Huh!

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.473
Pretty good. Pretty good.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.060
How much is that?

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:54.481
With the sword, $299.99 plus tax.

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:55.732
Yeah, l'll wear it now.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.568
Come on, man, let's go!

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:01.988
l'll be right out.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:06.034
Should have used the cufflink thing.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:26.763
Spaceman balls?

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.691
Get your goddamn hands
off my motherfucking junk!

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:41.820
lt's in there! lt's in there!

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:53.915
Hello.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.626
O'Reilly!

01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:58.461
You dumb shit,
that's just some asshole in a mask.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:01.715
Holy Mary, Mother of God!

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:03.675
l gotta quit smoking.

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.387
Let's go!

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:08.763
Sorry, ma'am!

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.314
- Shit!
- Don't let... Behind me!

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:19.983
Hurry up, buttcracks!

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:21.067
Look, it's that nerd.

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:22.903
Oh!

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.155
Oh, yeah!

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:26.907
- Who was that kid?
- Keith Nash!

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:28.074
Punch it!

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.744
l don't know what happened!
Who is that kid?

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:39.711
- Get the car started!
- Yes, sir!

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:43.173
Whoa, whoa. What's going on?
Did you guys get me some information?

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:44.841
We saw it. We saw the alien.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:47.594
lt was in the comic book shop. lt's hideous!
l think l shit my pants.

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:48.929
l don't know what you guys
are talking about.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.556
You know what?

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.559
You know exactly what we're talking about.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.811
l'm sick and tired
of being in the dark on this...

01:11:56.896 --> 01:12:01.149
Where the fuck did he go?

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.776
l got your door for you.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:03.985
l got mine.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.738
He went with those nerds.

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:10.450
So, you want to follow us, big guy?

01:12:10.534 --> 01:12:12.452
- You kids are gonna go back to the base.
- Uh-huh.

01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:15.413
Daddy's gonna stick behind,
do a little adult work.

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:17.332
Now, tell me which way
the little green guy went.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.876
- North East highway.
- North East highway.

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:21.127
Straight home, now.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:27.050
Sorry, guys. lt's my dad!

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:30.262
This guy doesn't quit.
You kind of have to respect it.

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:39.729
- Oh, God, Graeme, drive faster.
- Go away, Dad!

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.065
- Guys, calm down.
- Those asshorns are gonna catch us!

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:43.608
l said, calm down! Pull over!

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.193
- What do you mean, pull over?
- Pull over!

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.047
All right. That's it.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:09.259
This is too dangerous.
l can make it on my own from here.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.636
- What do you mean?
- No. Graeme, you've done enough.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:14.639
l'll boost a car or something.
l can drive an automatic.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.057
You're a terrible driver!

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.601
He's right, Paul.
You can't even drive a spaceship.

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:20.895
l'm close now. l'll be fine.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.564
But we've come all this way.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.024
Yeah, and at what cost, huh?

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:27.277
l've shaken your faith.
l've almost gotten you guys killed!

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:28.528
l just want to get home.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:32.407
You are going home. l think we've come
too far to let you do this alone.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:35.869
Yeah. What happened to BFFs?
We are in this together, Paul.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:38.955
You bet your hairy love eggs we are.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.082
The last 72 hours
have been the ride of my life

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.209
and l'm fucked
if l'm getting off this bus now!

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:45.795
- Yeah, me, too.
- And me.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.547
Well, that settles it.

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:49.674
We're all fucked.

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:52.677
Thank you guys so much.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:57.724
lf you're absolutely sure, there is
a little something you can do for me.

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.189
- What about this one?
- No, too small.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.982
- Really?
- Yeah, too small.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:13.323
- Seems rather fitting.
- Mmm.

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:19.537
- That wasn't difficult, was it?
- No. Not at all.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.372
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.125
That'll be $299.99, plus tax.

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:27.253
Same as the sword.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.132
- Look. They're running.
- Holy shit!

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:33.593
- Get the door.
- Oh, shit. Can you drive this thing?

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:35.303
l've been driving these things my whole life.

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:39.808
Come on! Get in, get in.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.103
Graceful.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.236
Zoil. Picked up a 9-1-1 outside of Prospect.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:55.156
A fireworks store just got ripped off
by two British nerds in an RV.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.241
Son of a bitch!

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:59.661
According to local bacon,
they're on the 14, 40 miles west of you.

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:02.080
Drive Iike a man,
you'll catch up to them in 30.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.833
Cops are standing down.
You better spin your ass around!

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.292
Roger that!

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:13.049
Don't make me come out there.

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:15.385
l'm guest of honor
at the governor's ball tonight

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:16.886
and l'm dressed up real nice.

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:19.764
Where the hell does this 14 go, anyway?

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.015
You tell me.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.935
You got Thermopolis, you got Lytle Creek.

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:27.522
Holy shit! Moorcroft's on the 14.

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.065
You don't think...

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.109
Son of a bitch is going back.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:34.070
He's gonna try and make contact.
We got him, Zoil.

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:35.613
Bring me back my space monkey

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:39.075
and l guarantee you level 5 clearance
and all the perks.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.077
Great. Better parking space
would be good.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:44.080
l don't know, man. l don't know.
He looked awful mad.

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:48.209
Fuck him. He's a dinosaur.
lt's time for some new blood.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.344
Okay. We're nearly there.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:15:59.721
This is where we've been headed?

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:02.390
No. l just need to make
a little stop first, okay?

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:04.601
Do you think we've really got time
to be making little stops?

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:07.187
This is something l really have to do.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.815
Okay, stop here. This is good.
This is close enough.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.906
Shouldn't we park a bit closer?

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.408
No. We don't want to scare her.

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.577
Scare who?

01:16:24.496 --> 01:16:25.580
- You knock.
- You knock.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:26.706
l always knock.

01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:29.500
Who's there?

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.587
ls that Tara Walton?

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.923
Leave me alone.

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:39.677
Ms. Walton, my name is Clive Gollings.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.555
l'm here with my friend, Mr. Graeme Willy.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:48.603
And what do you want?

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:54.817
We're here with the alien
that killed your dog 60 years ago.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:00.782
Let's go. Let's just go.

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:03.159
What is this? Some kind of a joke?

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.623
Hey, Tara.

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:13.670
You!

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.929
That's a very loud clock, isn't it?

01:17:23.013 --> 01:17:26.808
You have a nerve showing your face here
after all these years.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:30.895
Maybe l should make some tea.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.313
l'll do it.

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.986
Okay.

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:49.622
Look, Tara.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:53.126
l only just stopped believing in you,
you know.

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:58.256
l spent a very long time trying to convince
folks about what happened that night.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.259
Everyone said l was mad!

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:05.555
They told me it was a meteor
that squashed little Paul.

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:09.559
They took me away and they did tests.

01:18:09.643 --> 01:18:12.061
They said it was for cosmic radiation.

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.690
That l was concussed, hallucinating.

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:17.734
But l knew you were real!

01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:20.737
l pulled you from that spaceship myself.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.655
l kept you warm and comfortable.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.950
l sat there with you till the men came
to take you away.

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:28.870
Pop tried to understand,

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:32.957
but he would just smile and say,
"There there, Tara."

01:18:34.626 --> 01:18:37.628
When word got out about my story,

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:42.842
kids used to come and throw stones
at the house, call me names.

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:45.762
And l just hid myself away.

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:50.058
l'd spend whole nights up there,
just staring at the sky,

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:52.518
hoping that l'd catch a glimpse of you.

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:54.645
And here you are.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:19:00.985
l'm sorry.
lf l could have done it any other way, l...

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.279
Oh, it's okay.

01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:04.655
You're real.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.324
That's all that matters.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:08.993
- l was right.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:11.954
And all those folks that said l was crazy?

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:14.832
They can all just go fuck themselves.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:21.005
l brought something for you.
l thought you might want it back.

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:25.218
Here you go.

01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:32.016
Oh, thank you.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.194
Who do you suppose that is?

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:47.740
- Where did that come from?
- Holy shit! lt's them!

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:49.033
l'll take the front!

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:51.577
Oh!

01:19:52.746 --> 01:19:55.123
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:56.541
Go! Go!

01:20:02.714 --> 01:20:04.257
Haggard!

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:05.466
Alien!

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.981
Shit! Haggard! Where's the party, man?

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.567
There's no one in this place!
Come on, buddy, help me out.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.693
Oh, fuck!

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:26.445
Freeze, motherfucker!

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.197
So weak.

01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:29.866
Give me the alien!

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.451
Give me the fucking alien!

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:34.412
- No!
- Ow! Fuck. Watch it.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:35.997
Give me the alien!

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:38.166
Get your own alien.

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:48.634
Thank you, Clive! ls Tara with us?

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:51.679
Tara! Come this way! Follow us!

01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:53.681
Oh, man-balls! lt's my dad!

01:20:53.765 --> 01:20:55.600
Are you okay? Am l heavy?

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.393
l told you, it's not fat, it's power!

01:20:59.771 --> 01:21:01.063
Oh, great.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.362
l told you we should've parked closer!

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:12.909
Holster that. They're mine!

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.620
- Consider that a warning!
- You crazy bastard!

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:19.123
l got you, you little space freak!

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.125
Ruth! Get back here!

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.251
Just go home!

01:21:26.673 --> 01:21:28.966
Oh, l got you, sucker. Coming.

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:30.468
Ready or not.

01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:40.478
Holy fuck.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:50.404
- Papa!
- Ruth, wait!

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:54.325
Papa! Papa!

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:56.077
Oh!

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.204
lt's okay, he's alive. He's okay!

01:21:59.539 --> 01:22:01.540
- Go, Clive, go!
- Wait for me!

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:02.833
You okay?

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.585
- Thank you. l'm okay.
- Wait there.

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:14.053
Graeme!

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:19.642
Ruth! Drive!

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:24.021
Come on, Graeme!

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.149
Don't leave me!

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:34.031
Never.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:38.077
Graeme, you scared the shit out of me.

01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:40.037
Ruth, why aren't you driving?

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.998
l told you. lt's easy!

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:52.258
Got it. Got it. Got it. Shit. Shit. Shit.
Road! Okay.

01:22:53.176 --> 01:22:55.720
Small corrections! Small corrections!

01:22:58.098 --> 01:23:00.558
Oh, my weed!

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.351
Oh!

01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:24.248
Motherfucking titty-sucking two-balled bitch!

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.425
Zoil, progress report.

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:39.889
This is Haggard, sir.
Agent Zoil is no longer in command.

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:42.516
l don't give a shit who's in command.
Where the fuck are they?

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:45.394
Just ahead of me,
heading east towards Lytle Creek.

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:48.856
l don't wanna hear from anybody
until that cocksucker is dead! Get me?

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.191
Yes, sir.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.275
Ma'am.

01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:58.783
God damn it!

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:06.207
This is official government business!

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:09.460
Stand down,
or l am authorized to use deadly force.

01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:12.046
That thing has my daughter!

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:13.756
This isn't your mission!

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.550
l'm on a mission from God!

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:17.968
Tell him you failed.

01:24:18.512 --> 01:24:19.512
Oh!

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:34.819
Shit! We got company.

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:43.953
He's trying to overtake us!

01:24:44.037 --> 01:24:45.913
- Don't let him get past!
- Should l ram him?

01:24:45.997 --> 01:24:48.707
- What about the deposit?
- Fuck the deposit.

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:49.875
You're crazy!

01:24:57.008 --> 01:24:58.092
Fuck.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.602
Oh, fuck! Come on!

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:09.937
Smile, you son of a bitch!

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:12.273
Eyes forward, butthorn.

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:24.326
Do you think he'll be okay?

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:25.786
Yeah, he'll be fine.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.207
Mmm.

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:36.380
- Haggard.
- Zoil.

01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:38.048
Where are the other two?

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.676
One crashed and burned,
the otherjust burned.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.179
Jesus Christ!
This has been one fuck-up after another.

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:45.139
l should have handled this myself.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:47.600
l am very close. You give me one hour.

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:50.728
An hour? l'll be eating canapés
with the governor in an hour.

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.313
l need this wrapped up now!

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:55.357
No, no. They're mine, damn it.
l'm gonna finish this, once and for all.

01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:58.235
Too late, Zoil. l'm bringing in the big guns.

01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:02.364
Boring conversation anyway.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:10.498
Fare thee well, my friend.
You were a faithful and mighty steed.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:11.957
l can't believe she's gone.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:13.209
Ain't that a bag of tits.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:16.504
Oh, what'll we do now, Paul?

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:18.130
Paul?

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.925
Paul, where are you going?

01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:33.604
See? What did l tell you, fellas?

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:35.981
You'd know it when you saw it.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:38.859
Oh.

01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:40.402
Of course.

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:54.625
- Ah! Right. Shoots flaming balls. Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:58.003
- Can you just light the fucking thing?
- Fireworks are not toys, Paul.

01:26:58.088 --> 01:27:01.632
- What is the suggested safe distance?
- Right.

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:05.052
- 500 feet.
- That's going to put us behind the tree line.

01:27:05.136 --> 01:27:07.471
- We're not gonna enjoy the full effect.
- That's true, actually.

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:08.556
Hey, what the...

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.266
Oh! Now you're running, huh?

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:12.643
That's not funny. That's dangerous.

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:46.176
What now?

01:27:46.886 --> 01:27:49.346
We wait.

01:27:57.564 --> 01:27:59.106
Yes.

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:00.566
- That's amazing.
- Thank you.

01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:01.775
Not bad.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.819
That's three times you've done that now.

01:28:03.903 --> 01:28:05.904
l never met anyone...

01:28:35.477 --> 01:28:36.644
Oh, no, you don't.

01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:42.191
Wait a minute.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:55.954
Stay where you are, you little green bastard!

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.435
lt's the Big Guy.

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:23.273
Well, what do you know?

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:25.651
Small world.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:29.279
- Paul!
- Zoil?

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:47.631
Huh?

01:29:55.849 --> 01:29:59.143
Don't fucking move!

01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:03.147
Okay, everyone be cool.
Everyone just be cool.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.607
l gotta say, l'm a little hurt, Agent Zoil.

01:30:05.692 --> 01:30:07.776
He introduced me to my wife. He's my friend.

01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:11.905
You stupid son of a bitch.
You could've been where l am in 15 years.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:15.033
- l don't want to be where you are.
- Too bad,

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:18.454
seeing as how
l'm the one holding all the cards.

01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:21.165
And when l say "cards," l of course mean

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:22.833
big fucking gun.

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:24.293
Very big gun.

01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:28.005
- Let's go, Mork.
- Don't call me Mork.

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.715
- No.
- Guys, you don't have to do this.

01:30:29.799 --> 01:30:31.175
No, he's going nowhere.

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:34.261
Can it, nerds.

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:37.264
Shit, l'd shoot you now
if l didn't get off on the idea

01:30:37.348 --> 01:30:40.893
of your being hog-tied and pissed on
in Guantanamo Bay.

01:30:40.977 --> 01:30:42.728
They've shut Guantanamo Bay.

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:44.062
Did they?

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:46.440
Be honest with yourselves.

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:50.569
What do you think you can possibly bring
to the table at this point in the game?

01:30:52.572 --> 01:30:54.573
Blind fury.

01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:58.035
Oh.

01:30:58.328 --> 01:30:59.995
False economy. l told you.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.539
Step aside, fag.

01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:11.089
Oh! Dude!

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:12.257
lnsane!

01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:23.268
Oh!

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.647
Ow!

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:36.031
- Ruth!
- Get away from her, you bitch!

01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:38.450
Ow!

01:31:42.622 --> 01:31:44.248
Zoil, you okay, man?

01:31:45.708 --> 01:31:48.293
- So much for the plan, huh?
- l know, right?

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:50.212
Sorry l zapped you at the farmhouse.

01:31:50.296 --> 01:31:52.589
That's okay. l'm sorry l wasn't there
to meet you outside the base.

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:54.299
By the time l got there, you'd already gone.

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:56.760
But l see you got yourself a plan B, huh?

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:59.221
Did l ever. These are my friends.

01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:01.056
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you boys.

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:03.475
- You did a hell of a job.
- Thank you, Agent Zoil.

01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:05.561
Please call me Lorenzo.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:06.979
- Lorenzo Zoil?
- Lorenzo Zoil?

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:09.898
That's right.

01:32:11.734 --> 01:32:12.943
Ruth!

01:32:13.862 --> 01:32:14.903
Papa?

01:32:18.741 --> 01:32:20.117
- Paul!
- Ruth!

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:26.331
That was close.

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:33.839
Oh, my!

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:36.967
No!

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:38.677
Oh, God, Graeme.

01:32:38.761 --> 01:32:40.679
Graeme!

01:32:40.763 --> 01:32:43.140
- l never meant to...
- Put the gun down, Mr. Buggs.

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:44.766
Drop the fucking gun, Dad!

01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:47.060
Oh, no!

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:49.271
l really liked this T-shirt.

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:52.691
This is all my fault.
We should never have come on holiday.

01:32:52.775 --> 01:32:56.028
No, no. lt's fine. lt's fine, Clive.

01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:57.613
We've had a good time, haven't we?

01:32:57.697 --> 01:32:59.781
Yeah. But you got shot.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:05.787
Yeah, l know. But l can honestly say, Clive,
this is the most fun l have ever had.

01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:14.129
Graeme?

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:20.427
Graeme?

01:33:21.638 --> 01:33:22.679
Graeme?

01:33:27.727 --> 01:33:29.227
l've gotta try, right?

01:33:32.148 --> 01:33:34.566
- Yeah?
- No, no.

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:41.657
Paul, think about this.

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:32.040
Paul!

01:34:37.547 --> 01:34:38.839
Paul?

01:34:57.150 --> 01:34:59.901
Oh, that sucked. l don't even get to eat him.

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:07.909
Wasn't that really, really dangerous?

01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:12.289
Sometimes, you just gotta roll the dice.

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:14.750
lt's a miracle!

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:20.839
The Lord has delivered his healing hand!

01:35:20.923 --> 01:35:23.300
You can't win with these people.

01:35:27.513 --> 01:35:31.725
- Sorry you got killed by my dad.
- That's fine.

01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:35.020
- Do you want to try that kiss again?
- Fuck, yeah.

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:42.778
Well, what do you know?
The geek shall inherit the Earth.

01:35:45.031 --> 01:35:46.031
Huh?

01:35:54.457 --> 01:35:55.874
Well, ain't this...

01:35:56.375 --> 01:35:57.834
Oh!

01:35:59.921 --> 01:36:03.048
l changed my mind. That is Jenga.

01:36:11.224 --> 01:36:12.891
lt feels better.

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:24.110
Okay?

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.490
Oh, that's good.

01:36:28.574 --> 01:36:30.992
- This is a nice one of you.
- Thank you.

01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:32.410
Look, Mr. Buggs.

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:33.787
lt's been a hell of a ride, huh?

01:36:34.997 --> 01:36:36.248
Sorry l frightened the shit out of you.

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:40.252
You didn't frighten me. You freed me.

01:36:40.711 --> 01:36:42.295
l'm glad.

01:36:43.381 --> 01:36:44.422
Mmm. That's nice.

01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:46.466
Thanks.

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.181
Hey, take care of her, big man.

01:36:53.266 --> 01:36:56.101
Oh, l will, sir. And God be with you.

01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:58.144
Yeah, whatever, dude. Sure.

01:37:02.942 --> 01:37:04.442
Say bye to Karen for me.

01:37:05.987 --> 01:37:07.612
Safe trip, Short Round.

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:09.489
Thanks.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:22.377
- Oh, you're coming with me.
- What?

01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:24.379
l ruined your life, Tara.

01:37:24.463 --> 01:37:26.715
l think it's only right l give you a new one.

01:37:27.633 --> 01:37:28.717
Oh.

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.511
l don't have my toothbrush.

01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:36.308
Baby, where we're going,
you don't need teeth.

01:37:41.814 --> 01:37:44.983
That's right. Right on. Get in there, girl.

01:37:45.651 --> 01:37:48.194
Yeah, she's cool. She's with me.
Let her in. Yeah. No.

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:54.492
Gentlemen.

01:37:56.996 --> 01:37:59.122
l meant to ask,
what did you think of the book?

01:38:00.499 --> 01:38:02.667
l liked it, actually. l really liked it.

01:38:02.752 --> 01:38:05.420
There's lot of good ideas in it.

01:38:05.504 --> 01:38:08.632
l kind of found it hard to finish, to be honest.

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:11.426
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:13.428
You know, as l always say,

01:38:13.512 --> 01:38:16.765
"You have to spin a good yarn
before you can weave a great dream."

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:19.643
That's what Adam Shadowchild said.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:22.187
That asshole! He stole that from me.

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:23.605
Huh.

01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:26.858
- He was a bit of an asshole, actually.
- Yeah, he was.

01:38:28.527 --> 01:38:31.988
- Keep it for the journey home, if you like.
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

01:38:38.371 --> 01:38:40.956
lt's safe to say
we've all learned something from this.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:44.125
Be yourselves. Speak from your heart.
Some shit like that, l don't know.

01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:48.338
Yeah, you know,
l certainly feel a bit different.

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:50.507
And me.

01:38:51.092 --> 01:38:52.842
Thank you, guys.

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:56.513
- No, thank you.
- Yeah, thanks, Paul.

01:38:57.682 --> 01:38:59.641
Hugs?

01:38:59.725 --> 01:39:00.934
Come on.

01:39:05.982 --> 01:39:07.440
Clive, l can feel your boner.

01:39:13.948 --> 01:39:15.615
Till next time.

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:25.375
- So cool, isn't it?
- lt's amazing!

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.295
Goodbye!

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.654
See you! Goodbye!

01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:05.582
This ship takes off very slowly.
lt's a little awkward.

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:06.791
Goodbye!

01:40:08.294 --> 01:40:10.295
Can you guys take off any faster? Come on!

01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:01.554
Ah!

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.557
That was good, wasn't it?

01:41:18.697 --> 01:41:19.823
Hey.

01:41:24.829 --> 01:41:28.623
- Leias!
- Thank you. Cheers.

01:41:32.419 --> 01:41:33.503
Sorry. Who are you?

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.172
Someone who loves you.

01:41:36.507 --> 01:41:39.717
Hey! l thought you were coming
as Wonder Woman today.

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.891
All right, would you please welcome

01:41:46.976 --> 01:41:52.021
the team behind this year's
multi-Nebulon-award-winning best seller.

01:41:58.737 --> 01:42:00.780
By the way, these are friends of mine.

01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:04.409
- l'm very proud of you, Graeme.
- l'm very proud of you, Sausage.

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:06.536
Come on.

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:19.674
Pat Stevens?
Like, Pat Stevens from Chapter 1?

01:42:19.758 --> 01:42:20.884
The very same.

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:22.719
You know, l always pictured you taller.

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:25.513
- You should see me standing up.
- Oh, l'd like that.

01:42:35.399 --> 01:42:37.567
l didn't realize you were so damn pretty.

01:42:37.651 --> 01:42:39.194
You should see me
out of these crazy clothes.

01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:41.321
l'd like that.

01:42:42.072 --> 01:42:43.281
Mmm.

01:42:45.117 --> 01:42:46.201
l can't.

01:42:52.333 --> 01:42:54.459
l understand, apparently,
they are citing me as the...

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:56.794
Well, fuck. You know...

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:04.886
Please welcome to the stage,
Clive Gollings and Graeme Willy.

01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:06.095
Give it up.

01:43:08.641 --> 01:43:11.142
Three, two, one.

01:43:11.644 --> 01:43:13.186
Congratulations.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:14.729
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:43:27.117 --> 01:43:28.701
Graeme! Clive!

01:43:29.286 --> 01:43:31.871
Whoo! l know those guys!

01:43:49.306 --> 01:43:51.015
- You!
- Hi.
