* MTV...

00:07.975 --> 00:10.311
[music]

00:14.482 --> 00:16.350
[Joe] What are you studying?

00:16.384 --> 00:19.053
Cruz, head in the game.
What are you studying?

00:19.087 --> 00:21.055
- Art history?

00:21.089 --> 00:22.090
- Do you know anything
about art?

00:22.123 --> 00:23.924
- Not really, no.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.294
- What if someone happens to ask
you about Picasso or Renoir?

00:26.327 --> 00:27.595
- English, then.

00:27.628 --> 00:31.065
- Name five books
by Herman Melville.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.600
- Okay, fine, you tell me.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.535
- Undecided.
- That's interesting.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.637
It's boring as fuck,
that's the point.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.506
Don't let her friends
dig into you.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.274
Answer their questions
with questions.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.876
Your life is boring,
their life is fascinating.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.478
Ask them questions
about their lives.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.080
It's all they want
to talk about anyway.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.381
[Cruz] Have you been
to Chesapeake?

00:47.415 --> 00:48.882
- Yes.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.551
- It's fucking beautiful.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.453
- They will bug and place
a tracker in your vehicle,

00:52.486 --> 00:53.554
they will sweep your phone.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.356
Do not call from
your mark phone.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.959
Any problems text "call me"
to Daddy in your contacts.

00:58.992 --> 01:02.130
- "Call me" to Daddy, got it.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.397
- Roger that, ma'am.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.200
- Roger that, ma'am.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.035
- When you're ten blocks from
the house kill the burner.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.239
- Gonna kill it
right now, ma'am.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.673
- Why now?

01:12.706 --> 01:13.907
- This is the perfect spot.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.543
- Good luck.

01:17.411 --> 01:21.582
[music]

01:21.615 --> 01:23.117
[sea gulls calling]

01:39.333 --> 01:42.102
[music]

02:41.362 --> 02:42.663
- That was fast.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.432
- They buddied up
pretty good in Kuwait.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.268
I'm not surprised she called.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.203
- But you're surprised
about something.

02:49.237 --> 02:52.005
- She has access to more
money than I expected.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.441
A lot more.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.108
And more connections
in the States.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.777
- Who owns the house
in Chesapeake?

02:56.810 --> 02:59.613
- Morning ladies, care to hear
the specials today?

02:59.647 --> 03:01.382
- Surprise us with them.
- Two specials?

03:01.415 --> 03:02.750
- Please.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.319
- Any allergies to shellfish,
peanuts, gluten?

03:05.353 --> 03:06.354
- I'm allergic to my ex-husband,

03:06.387 --> 03:09.022
to everything else I'm immune.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.291
- No allergies.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.362
Qudrah Petrol owns the property.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.096
- That's strange.
- Very.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.432
- You have a theory?
- None that make sense.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.568
- Both founding members of OPEC.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.202
- That's not enough.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.472
- Maybe they're onto us.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.507
- Even if they were,
they wouldn't send his daughter

03:26.540 --> 03:28.341
on the op
to shut us down.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.379
- No, they'd throw a big party
and plant someone on her.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.147
- Possibly.
- Like they're doing today.

03:34.180 --> 03:35.783
- I have a team waiting
in case we're blown.

03:35.816 --> 03:39.086
And I'd rather have it blow
here than Dubai or Jordan.

03:42.122 --> 03:45.192
- How well do you know
Senator Palmer?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.160
- Chairs Foreign Intelligence.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.228
- A real fucking asshole.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.530
- I bet.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.499
- This one of your
science experiments?

03:51.531 --> 03:53.401
[Meade] This one survived
the experiment.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.102
- Nice to see someone did.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.103
Are you joining us?

03:56.136 --> 03:57.671
- I'm leaving.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.573
- Keep me posted.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.375
- Yep. Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.143
- I took the liberty
of ordering for you.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.145
I hope you don't mind.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.481
- Isn't even noon, and I'm
already sick of making
decisions.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.450
I appreciate you taking
one off my plate.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.452
- Got a couple more I can
help you with.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.489
- Slick, smiling motherfucker.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.759
[chatter]

04:18.792 --> 04:21.629
[music]

04:26.199 --> 04:27.668
- Joe.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.736
Hey, Joe.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.605
What fuck are you doing?

04:31.639 --> 04:33.240
You think I'm having
you snatched?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.808
- You never can tell.
It is a Monday, Kyle.

04:34.842 --> 04:38.178
- God, look how fucking
wound up you are.

04:38.211 --> 04:41.549
Jesus, I miss the Middle East.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.216
- I'm so fucking sick of Mexico.
- Mm.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.721
- What are you doing here?

04:47.755 --> 04:51.191
- Um, I'm late for my class
at Soul Cycle.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.527
- You between things?

04:53.561 --> 04:55.329
- You know I can't talk
about that.

04:55.363 --> 04:58.466
Certainly not on the street
across from the fucking Capital.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.668
How many audio amplifiers are
outside this restaurant?

05:00.701 --> 05:04.171
- I'm just asking if
you're on the clock.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.739
- There's a meter
running, Kyle. Yeah.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.779
- You, uh...
You got your team here, too?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.148
- [scoffs]

05:15.182 --> 05:16.584
- Could I borrow 'em
for a day or two?

05:16.617 --> 05:17.651
- We're pretty busy, buddy.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.653
- Look, I'm in a bind, okay?

05:19.687 --> 05:21.889
Got a contact trafficking
for the Sonorans,

05:21.922 --> 05:23.824
they're bringing in
Syrians and Afghans

05:23.857 --> 05:24.792
over by the fucking truckload.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.494
- Sounds like a good mark.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.797
- Except he's stuck in a
fucking jail in Van Horn, Texas

05:29.830 --> 05:31.231
and when the snitches
get word across the border

05:31.264 --> 05:32.466
he's a fucking dead man.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.667
- In jail for what?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.503
- Nothing.
DUI.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.638
But he's in the system,
fucker's wanted.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.306
When they figure that out
they're gonna hand him over

05:39.339 --> 05:41.375
to Homeland Security
and some desk warrior's

05:41.409 --> 05:43.644
gonna try and flip him
and he's fucking dead.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.245
- What do you want my team for?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.681
- I want to snatch him
on the transfer.

05:47.715 --> 05:52.486
[music]

05:52.520 --> 05:53.921
- Are you out of
your fucking mind?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.789
- I don't have a choice.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.791
If Homeland finds out that we're
planting a flag on the border

05:57.825 --> 05:59.493
it'll end up in the news.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.929
With these fucking
head hunters in Congress now,

06:01.962 --> 06:03.497
there will be a hearing

06:03.531 --> 06:04.865
and then they start
flipping fucking stones.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.535
- Looking for us everywhere.
- Yeah. Okay.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.403
Look, my team's on
something right now.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.638
We could be wheels
up at any minute.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.473
Nobody else has a team?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.575
- No, they're all in Ukraine,
Taiwan, or fucking Africa.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.477
And they won't let me
have a team state-side.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.746
- There's a decent
Constitutional reason
for that, Kyle.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.348
- You got one.
- I have a protection detail.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.850
- And it's just as illegal.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.858
- I'll give you three.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.427
But I'll need them back
in 48 hours.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.596
- You got it.
- Expect a call.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.364
- I fucking love you, Joe.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.500
- You don't fucking love me.
You owe me, motherfucker.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.435
- When I need it most.
- Done.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.972
[music]

06:53.747 --> 06:55.248
- Check check check.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.217
I hope you guys
can hear me.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.268
- Good afternoon, Miss Adid.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.369
- Hi.
- Any bags?

07:16.403 --> 07:18.305
- Uh...
just one, I can get it.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.674
- No, no, please. I insist.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.776
Everyone's by the pool.
Come, I'll show you the way.

07:22.810 --> 07:23.844
- Thanks

07:28.616 --> 07:32.419

08:20.000 --> 08:21.535
- [laughs]
You made it!

08:21.569 --> 08:22.803
- Told you I was coming.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.871
- I had my doubts.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.540
[music playing]

08:26.574 --> 08:28.542
Come.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.477
This is my friend Zara.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.914
That's Nala, Malika,
and Nashwa.

08:33.947 --> 08:34.948
- What's up, Zara?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.350
[shouting]

08:38.586 --> 08:40.587
- You got my fucking hair wet!

08:40.621 --> 08:41.688
- You're in the fucking pool.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.056
- Such a brute.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.525
Why does God only give
good bodies to assholes?

08:45.559 --> 08:47.527
- Malika?
- Hmm?

08:47.561 --> 08:48.629
- Come meet Zara.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.998
- She's rescued another stray.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.833
- I'll explain the
whole soap opera:

08:52.866 --> 08:54.568
Kamal is Sami's best friend.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.837
- Who's Sami?
- Behind the bar.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.940
- Kamal used to date Nashwa,
then he dated Malika

08:59.973 --> 09:01.975
so Malika and Nashwa
hated each other,

09:02.009 --> 09:04.511
but then he did what Kamal does,
and fucked some little blonde,

09:04.544 --> 09:06.914
so she broke up with him,
but by that time

09:06.947 --> 09:09.817
Nashwa was dating Sami,
so Kamal is still with us...

09:09.850 --> 09:11.819
And Malika and Nashwa
are best friends again

09:11.852 --> 09:13.453
because they have
someone in Kamal

09:13.486 --> 09:14.922
they can both hate together.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.423
- Doesn't seem to bother him.

09:16.456 --> 09:17.891
- Not much bothers Kamal.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.961
And depending on the night
and who drinks the most

09:20.994 --> 09:22.963
and whether he comes
home alone or not,

09:22.996 --> 09:25.465
one of them will find
their way into his room.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.400
It's all very...

09:27.434 --> 09:31.404
- So, Nashwa dates Sami...

09:31.438 --> 09:34.875
- Used to, they broke up
as well.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.076
- Then...

09:36.109 --> 09:37.544
- What are they doing here?

09:37.577 --> 09:40.080
Kamal is my fiancé's brother.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.716
He's working.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.584
Very serious.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.619
- Ah.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.620
- Let me get a look at you.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.157
- Oh, uh...

09:50.190 --> 09:51.892
- Take off the glasses.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.994
- She was in a car wreck.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.663
- So?

09:56.730 --> 10:01.468
[music]

10:01.501 --> 10:02.770
Oh my God.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.604
- I told you.
- That looks terrible.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.807
Does it hurt?

10:06.840 --> 10:07.875
- Little bit.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.678
- This will help.

10:10.711 --> 10:11.945
- What is it?

10:11.979 --> 10:14.682
- I warn you,
his drinks are evil.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.720
- Put on your suit.
Let's go to the beach.

10:19.753 --> 10:24.424
- Oh, I've got it on,
let me just...

10:26.593 --> 10:27.928
- [laughs]

10:27.961 --> 10:30.230
- How are you going to
find a husband in that?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.665
- What? This is good,
this is pretty.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.101
- No. Come with me.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.037
- And the project begins.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.144
- I want to see.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.679
- Mm-mm.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.214
- You're so shy.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.583
- I'm not shy, it's just...

10:50.617 --> 10:52.686
- If I can't see it how are you
going to wear it on the beach?

10:52.720 --> 10:56.089
- That is my point.
I can't wear this at the beach.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.701
I told you it was a bad wreck.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.840
- What did that?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.107
- I don't know.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.575
The seat belt I guess.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.610
Got against the door
pretty hard.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.912
- Did you see a doctor?

11:18.946 --> 11:20.113
- I'm fine.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.016
- No, you are not fine.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.624
- What a fucking mess.

11:36.629 --> 11:40.233
[music]

11:43.603 --> 11:44.738
[lock beeps]

11:46.306 --> 11:47.775
- How we doing?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.576
- It ain't great.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.179
- It's a fucking
observation nightmare.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.183
It's a house, sits on a
peninsula, surrounded by trees.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.450
There's no approach.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.852
I mean, we do have
a satellite on it,

11:58.886 --> 12:01.388
but we're only
getting God's view.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.157
So we're going
to rent a yacht.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.725
- How's our girl?

12:05.759 --> 12:09.296
- Well, she's beat to shit
and it freaked 'em all out.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.133
Think they called
a fucking doctor.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.835
- A doctor?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.736
- Yeah, I'm thinking maybe we
try to pull her out of there.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.239
- How, we can't call her?
They're screening the phones.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.740
- Well, we don't know that.

12:20.774 --> 12:24.611
- Qudrah Petrol owns the house.
They're screening calls.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.246
- What's Qudrah Petrol?

12:26.279 --> 12:29.249
- Saudi Oil
and Mobile joint venture.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.384
Makes more money than
Amazon and Apple combined.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.225
- Case officer on the border
needs help with an extraction.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.328
I need three, who's in?

12:41.361 --> 12:42.629
- A hot extraction?

12:42.662 --> 12:43.897
- Doesn't get any
hotter than this.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.899
- Fuck, I'll go.
- Pick me, coach.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.500
- Oh, I'm in.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.735
- Sending you his number.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.140
- You kids stay out of trouble.
Boss...

12:54.507 --> 12:56.609
- Wish us luck.
- Good luck.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.546
Where's the bugs?

12:59.579 --> 13:02.449
- Got one in the tassel
on her purse.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.384
One in the charm
on her necklace.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.520
- Let me see.
Yeah.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.889
None in the car?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.757
- I was worried they'd sweep it.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.926
- Yeah, well, I'm worried
they're gonna sweep her.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.895
And if they do now there's
just three of us

13:14.928 --> 13:16.329
going to get her.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.798
That's why we make
the big bucks.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.834
- Hi, Zara, I'm Dr. Brumley.

13:22.870 --> 13:23.837
Deep inhale.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.238
- [inhales]

13:25.272 --> 13:26.473
- Good, hold it.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.676
Exhale.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.311
- [exhales]

13:31.344 --> 13:32.512
- Again.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.680
- [inhales]

13:37.985 --> 13:39.652
- Exhale.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.321
- [exhales]

13:41.354 --> 13:43.323
- Good.
You can set your arm down.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.961
Car crash?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.262
- Yeah.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.766
- I want to show you something.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.636
Typically, in an auto
accident, the hematomas,

13:56.669 --> 13:59.706
the bruising, covers
large areas evenly,

13:59.739 --> 14:01.909
because it is large areas
of the vehicle

14:01.942 --> 14:03.510
that causes the trauma.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.513
Your contusions are not
consistent with that.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.714
- It was a compact car.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.486
- May I?

14:13.520 --> 14:17.457
- They're all the size
of a fist.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.692
- Oh, fuck it.
That's it.

14:19.726 --> 14:20.928
- We should probably
get on the road.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.429
We're about 15 minutes
from the house.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.897
Why are we fifteen
from the house?

14:23.931 --> 14:25.999
- Because this is
the closest hotel.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.734
Unless you want me to
rent a surveillance van

14:27.767 --> 14:28.868
from local PD?

14:28.902 --> 14:30.270
Come on, let's go.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.239
- No, no, we're not
pulling her out.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.840
We'll blow the whole
fucking operation.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.842
- As a physician, when I see
signs of physical abuse

14:35.875 --> 14:37.677
I am legally bound
to report them.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.778
- Come on, Cruz.
Come on, come on.
Just say something.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.613
Just talk your way out of this.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.882
- I know it might feel like that
will make things worse,

14:42.915 --> 14:45.385
but it doesn't get
much worse than this.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.222
And reporting it is how
the abuse stops.

14:54.627 --> 14:58.031
- I already reported it.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.732
I just didn't tell them.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.701
She, um...

15:01.734 --> 15:03.670
She invited me up here and...

15:06.839 --> 15:08.808
I'm trying to make friends.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.712
I'm trying to start a new life.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.684
I'm trying...

15:19.452 --> 15:24.391
I'm really, really trying.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.892
Please don't tell them.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.295
Please...

15:28.328 --> 15:31.999
- It's not my place to
tell your friends,

15:32.032 --> 15:35.035
But I need to be assured
that the authorities are aware.

15:35.068 --> 15:39.939
They arrested him
last night in North Carolina.

15:39.973 --> 15:43.676
That's... That's why I'm here.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.479
I'm...

15:46.513 --> 15:47.614
I'm getting away.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.751
At least I'm trying to.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.752
- That's pretty fucking good.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.321
- Yeah, it's not bad.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.455
- I want another go at
that SERE instructor

15:55.488 --> 15:57.890
who put us in
this situation.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.092
There's turning up the heat,

15:59.126 --> 16:01.694
then there's setting
her on fire.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.363
- Yeah.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.066
I told him to do it.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.868
- [scoffs]

16:10.870 --> 16:12.005
- It's my fault.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.643
- It's real hard to watch
the sunset from the restaurant

16:16.676 --> 16:18.045
if the sun had already set.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.848
- Then go.
Go to the fucking restaurant.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.084
- Been in there a while.
- Will you take them to town?

16:24.117 --> 16:26.619
Malika is missing the sunset.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.355
- You'll catch up?
- Maybe.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.057
- She should just get a dog.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.424
- She did.

16:39.899 --> 16:40.900
[door opens]

16:44.871 --> 16:47.074
- She's fine.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.741
Separated a few ribs.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.577
She's gonna be sore for a while.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.878
Ice on that nose will help.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.046
- Thank you.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.049
- Where'd everyone go?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.118
- Oh, who cares?

16:58.151 --> 16:59.852
We have the beach
to ourselves now.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.389
- [Sighs]
Dodged a bullet there.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.957
- All those nosy friends
are gonna be a fucking problem.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.159
- Soon as we get names,
dig hard.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.361
We're gonna get
pretty nosy, too.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.765
[music]

17:12.799 --> 17:14.434
- When is the wedding?

17:14.467 --> 17:15.468
- June.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.170
- Do you know where yet?

17:17.204 --> 17:19.172
- I would love to do it here.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.540
Or the Hamptons.
You know the Hamptons?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.076
- No.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.178
- Well, it's just every day
there's a celebration.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.781
But my family will
want everyone there, so Kuwait.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.784
If I'm lucky maybe we
get to do it in Dubai.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.553
You've been to Dubai?

17:33.586 --> 17:35.054
- Mmm.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.189
- Have you been anywhere?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.557
- Iraq.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.891
- Ugh.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.059
- Kuwait.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.794
- So boring to me.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.130
Keep the desert.

17:43.163 --> 17:46.499
I hate the heat and
the wind and the filth.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.668
You can lie to yourself
in a palace, but when

17:48.701 --> 17:49.936
the palace walls are behind you,

17:49.969 --> 17:52.071
and the lie stares
you in the face...

17:53.740 --> 17:55.642
Ehsan works in Manhattan,
thank God.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.110
I could never marry a man
who wants to live

17:57.144 --> 17:59.045
in the Middle East,
where I choke on the sand

17:59.078 --> 18:00.547
and all their rules.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.154
In Turkey there is
this beach, Oludeniz.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.789
And there is this place
they call the Blue Lagoon.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.459
It's heaven.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.894
My great fantasy is to
be ravaged on that beach.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.929
- Sounds like a good place for
your honeymoon.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.466
- Oh, no.
Ehsan is no ravager.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.134
He's too...

18:21.168 --> 18:22.101
- [laughs]

18:22.135 --> 18:24.103
Kamal, maybe.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.806
- Oh, that's not being ravaged.
That's being dry humped.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.575
[laughing]

18:28.608 --> 18:30.577
- I think I'll be much happier
after I have babies

18:30.610 --> 18:32.745
and the world allows me
to be fat.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.813
Know what I mean?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.248
- Not at all.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.250
- Of course you don't.
When will you be fat?

18:37.284 --> 18:39.652
But someday I'll be fat
and I can't wait.

18:41.554 --> 18:45.124
Maybe then this thing
will leave me alone.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.264
- The sand doesn't bother you?

18:51.298 --> 18:52.665
- Oh, no, I love it a little.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.506
I always thought sand
on the body was so erotic.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.277
I rolled in the sand all over,

19:04.311 --> 19:06.045
pulled Ehsan
into the trees.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.515
But then sand got everywhere

19:08.548 --> 19:10.650
and he itched and I itched.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.686
Turns out sand
is not erotic after all.

19:17.224 --> 19:20.227
It's funny how these
images in our minds...

19:20.260 --> 19:22.195
There's no
recreating them.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.065
They're only for the mind.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.734
No matter how hard we try.

19:30.069 --> 19:33.072
Stay away from
Malika and Nashwa.

19:33.105 --> 19:36.075
Nala's a nuisance,
but she's harmless.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.277
The other two...

19:40.012 --> 19:42.282
They hate every friend
I try to make.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.150
And they'll hate you, too.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.586
- Then why be around them?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.855
- Because it's not just husbands
they choose for you.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.262
- They choose your friends, too?

19:55.295 --> 19:57.029
- They choose it all.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.172
[music]

20:09.376 --> 20:10.710
[car approaching]

20:14.146 --> 20:16.148
[indistinct chatter]

20:51.451 --> 20:53.720
[kissing sounds]

21:05.798 --> 21:06.766
- This fucking day.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.435
- Jesus, don't you knock?

21:08.468 --> 21:12.238
- Why would I knock, Kate?
It's my fucking house.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.773
Where's your father?

21:13.806 --> 21:16.609
Porch. Where else?

21:16.643 --> 21:18.244
- What's your name?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.279
- Michael, ma'am.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.148
- Oh, we're way past ma'am.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.816
You got a phone, Michael?

21:23.850 --> 21:25.184
- I do.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.353
- Give it to me.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.887
- You want my--
- Give it to me.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.691
- You don't even know the code.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.561
[phone clicks]

21:36.563 --> 21:38.598
[phone ringing]

21:41.934 --> 21:42.902
[Woman] Hello.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.737
- Hi, this is Kate's mom.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.205
- Oh, hi.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.308
You ready for me
to pick him up?

21:49.342 --> 21:51.310
- I walked in on your son
dry humping

21:51.344 --> 21:53.413
my half-naked daughter,
so I'd say yes.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.881
- Wait, doing what?

21:54.914 --> 21:55.915
- He'll wait
for you at the curb.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.851
- Um, okay, I'll be--

22:00.953 --> 22:02.555
- Get out of my house.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.228
[door closes]

22:13.833 --> 22:15.635
- Go to your room.
- What did I do wrong?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.303
- Go to your room.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.240
- Tell me what I did wrong
and I'll go to my room.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.210
Tell me I did anything
you didn't do at my age.

22:24.243 --> 22:27.213
- And, by the way, you can't
just show up every six months.

22:27.246 --> 22:29.382
Play parent,
and "lay down the law."

22:29.416 --> 22:32.619
What law?
Your law doesn't even matter.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.455
- My law is the only
thing that matters.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.824
I'm your mother.
I brought you into this world.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.592
- Did I ask you to do that?

22:39.626 --> 22:41.494
I was pulled into
this world, screaming.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.995
- Oh, come on.

22:43.029 --> 22:43.963
- Nobody bothered to ask if
I wanted to be here.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.832
And yet I'm here, anyway.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.436
So I'll choose how I spend my
time here, thank you very much.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.438
And if you want to kick me
out of your house?

22:51.471 --> 22:54.407
Fine. Do it.
I'll survive.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.476
But don't think you can
tell me how to live the life

22:56.509 --> 22:58.611
that I never asked
for you to give me.

22:58.645 --> 22:59.979
[scoffs]

23:04.717 --> 23:08.588
[music]

23:08.621 --> 23:10.690
- All right, give me a better
image of the bile duct,

23:10.723 --> 23:13.526
but I say take it.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.862
- It looks acute to the head
of the pancreas.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.697
- Yeah, I know what
it looks like, Tom.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.266
But we are in the business
of eliminating possibilities.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.034
- I see no abnormalities,
I see no...

23:22.068 --> 23:24.437
- Tom.
Fucking surgeons.

23:24.471 --> 23:27.306
As the attending,
I am instructing you

23:27.339 --> 23:30.677
to remove the spleen
and the bile duct.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.712
- When he dies of meningitis
in five years,

23:32.745 --> 23:34.447
I'll remind you of
this in the law suit.

23:34.481 --> 23:37.283
- Yeah, you do that.
You do that, right on the stand.

23:37.316 --> 23:38.851
- This asshole.
- I heard that.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.920
- I wanted you to hear it, Tom.

23:40.953 --> 23:44.290
- I can see it's Monday
for everyone.

23:44.323 --> 23:46.025
This is gonna be a
week of Mondays.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.995
- I hate to pour on,
but our daughter was having

23:49.028 --> 23:51.964
quite the petting session
on our sofa.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.970
- We have rules about that.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.607
- Rules?

24:02.374 --> 24:05.512
- Yeah, anything over the jeans
is fine, but they stay on.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.981
She has discretion
with her shirt.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.750
- Discretion with the shirt.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.919
- I sacrificed the top to
protect the bottom.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.754
- You left some meat on the bone
in negotiation there.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.556
You should have
consulted with her mother.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.824
- When was I gonna do that?

24:21.928 --> 24:24.664
- I'm going to go take a shower.
How long is this going to last?

24:24.697 --> 24:26.933
- Well, it depends on when he
starts doing what I fucking ask.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.370
[music]

24:34.841 --> 24:36.609
[shouting]

24:48.020 --> 24:49.889
- Woo!

24:52.592 --> 24:54.694
[shouting]

25:15.447 --> 25:16.448
- Fuck it.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.968
Thanks.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.671
- Unless you care
for something stronger.

25:38.705 --> 25:39.872
- It's two in the morning.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.641
- I'm on vacation.
So are you.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.443
- Not really.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.445
- You could be.

25:46.478 --> 25:50.817
- Yeah, I lack the trust fund
for endless vacation.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.484
- You don't need a trust fund.

25:54.587 --> 25:55.788
Just need to find
a guy with one.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.189
- I'm good. Thanks.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.125
Stop it.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.427
I fucking mean it.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.996
- Ooh, she's a fighter.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.732
- I'm off to my room.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.199
- Perfect.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.068
[gasps]

26:11.904 --> 26:13.172
- Get your second wind?

26:13.205 --> 26:14.406
- Just getting some water.

26:15.942 --> 26:16.943
- What the fuck happened to you?

26:16.976 --> 26:19.011
- Nothing. I'm fine.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.546
- Bitch knows karate
or something.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.983
- No means no, player.
- Come on.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.653
- All right, we're gonna crash.
- Yeah. Me, too.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.858
[music]

26:48.274 --> 26:49.642
- Fuck.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.962
[knocking, knob rattling]

27:15.902 --> 27:16.969
[pounding]

27:23.209 --> 27:24.977
[speaking Arabic]

27:28.280 --> 27:29.749
[knocking]

27:46.866 --> 27:48.100
[knocking]

27:48.134 --> 27:49.869
- Miss Adid?

27:57.209 --> 27:58.845
Everything okay?

27:59.846 --> 28:01.580
- I've had better days.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.315
- We're around if you need us.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.917
- Thank you.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.859
[door locks]

28:12.892 --> 28:14.260
[music]

28:47.626 --> 28:49.495
[music]

28:50.930 --> 28:56.135
- So we're 29% of our RTP.
What's in the SDR?

28:56.168 --> 29:01.808
118 billion in holdings,
114 in allocations.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.343
I'd start with London.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.449
I agree.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.584
Makes as much sense
as cap and trade.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.589
- Any other paper claiming this?

29:17.623 --> 29:19.158
- Just London.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.329
- What's the Prime Minister
trying to hide today, I wonder?

29:23.362 --> 29:24.797
- It's a real problem.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.565
Government has overused
media to push a narrative,

29:26.598 --> 29:28.600
now nobody believes
anything they read.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.903
So there's no way to release
legitimate information

29:30.937 --> 29:32.805
and get anyone
to pay attention to it.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.175
- I didn't plant it.

29:38.710 --> 29:39.711
I didn't.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.582
How does that story help me?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.717
- Not sure.
I don't know your case load.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.857
- Is Iraq's oil production
back to normal?

29:50.890 --> 29:53.960
- Hundred million barrels
last month.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.828
- Exxon-Mobil's
biggest partner.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.430
- And BP.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.333
- How much of that oil
makes it here?

30:01.367 --> 30:03.302
- About five percent of it.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.603
[music]

30:07.806 --> 30:09.575
You've got a new case.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.310
- Same case.
New target.

30:13.980 --> 30:18.450
- Qudrah Oil sells
12 million barrels a day.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.653
Every day.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.222
Be careful poking
that bear, Kate.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.724
Or the target will be on you.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.730
- Want to go to Fiola
for dinner tonight?

30:31.763 --> 30:33.332
- Yeah, sure.

30:37.769 --> 30:40.506
- Errol.
- Hmm?

30:40.539 --> 30:42.008
- Face me.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.710
- Then the sun's on my screen
and I can't work.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.882
- I'll have my assistant make
a reservation at seven.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.750
- Six.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.753
Gotta wake up at two, and track
this mess of a Chinese market.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.965
- What are we doing in
this fucking relic?

31:05.998 --> 31:07.699
- This thing got fucking AC?

31:07.733 --> 31:09.335
- Nope.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.836
- Wanna talk ROE?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.604
- Perfect world
we take him clean.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.373
I'd like to avoid a gunfight.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.842
- Yeah, me too,
but that shit rarely happens.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.544
So, what's the play?

31:18.577 --> 31:21.647
- Avoid it unless it happens
then win at all costs.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.982
- What agency are we under?

31:24.583 --> 31:26.418
What's our flag, Kyle?

31:27.686 --> 31:29.655
What fucking agency
approved this?

31:29.688 --> 31:31.924
- It's not authorized.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.792
We're off the rez on this one.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.561
- Man, listen. You know these
cop cars got cameras,

31:35.594 --> 31:38.597
These officers got body
cams and fucking radios.

31:38.630 --> 31:39.932
There ain't
no off the reservation.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.805
- You fucking door kickers.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.808
- Oh, that's just fucking great.
Way to complicate things.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.543
- I'd turn off your phones.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.345
- This motherfucker.

31:53.379 --> 31:54.780
- Here comes our target.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.450
[music]

32:58.944 --> 33:00.646
- Boys, I think this
van has another tail.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.116
- Shit.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.717
- Let's see if I can get
this guy to pass me.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.746
- Exit's up here.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.515
If they take him,
they're gonna do it there.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.750
- You'd better be Johnny
on the spot with that EMP.

33:49.095 --> 33:51.563
- Soon as they make their move,
you fucking zap 'em.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.903
[music]

33:57.936 --> 33:59.071
- Oh, fuck me.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.041
Now!

34:10.116 --> 34:11.483
[tires squeal]

34:25.197 --> 34:26.598
- Christ.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.641
- Let me see your hands!

34:35.674 --> 34:37.176
- May not look like it, but
we just saved your lives.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.177
Leave us out of your
fucking report.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.445
Let's go!

34:45.650 --> 34:46.652
- Move!

34:49.554 --> 34:52.591
[shouting in Spanish]

34:52.623 --> 34:54.793
- Rapido, motherfucker!

34:54.826 --> 34:56.027
[shouting in Spanish]

34:59.298 --> 35:01.833
[shouting in Spanish]

35:05.537 --> 35:06.672
- Face down, now!

35:06.705 --> 35:08.607
- Don't see shit!
- Face down!

35:09.975 --> 35:11.210
Stay there.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.148
- Move!

35:22.888 --> 35:23.989
[tires squeal]

35:26.192 --> 35:28.260
[music]

35:47.213 --> 35:49.315
- Done some stupid
shit in my life.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.849
- This fucking tops it.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.585
- I thought that went
pretty good.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.521
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

36:07.032 --> 36:09.100
- Randy, drive this
motherfucker.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.036
[engine revs]

36:23.315 --> 36:25.284
[music]

37:28.280 --> 37:30.782
- How in the fuck do you expect
us to get away with this?

37:30.816 --> 37:32.250
- We just did.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.753
- We'll see about that.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.088
- What we're going to do is
hear this on the fucking news.

37:37.122 --> 37:39.257
- Administration won't even
admit there is a border.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.927
Worse than what we did happens
every day out here.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.830
Every fucking day,
and nobody covers it.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.265
And if they do,
the Administration

37:47.299 --> 37:50.201
kills the story before it
even teases going national.

37:50.235 --> 37:53.305
This story was over when
we got back in the truck.

38:02.581 --> 38:03.949
[music]

38:08.354 --> 38:09.888
[door opens]

38:15.427 --> 38:16.728
- I come bearing gifts.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.263
- Thank you.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.365
- How'd it go?

38:19.398 --> 38:20.932
- Well, one of 'em got handsy,

38:20.966 --> 38:24.336
but Cruz thumped him pretty
good by the sounds of it.

38:30.476 --> 38:33.545
[indistinct chatter]

38:41.920 --> 38:44.289
- They arguing?

38:44.322 --> 38:45.924
- Ehsan is sending him home.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.794
He thinks no means try harder.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.897
I'm sorry.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.665
- Oh, it's fine.

38:53.699 --> 38:56.635
Besides, he got
the worst of it, so...

38:56.668 --> 38:57.903
- I heard.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.043
- No more Sami for a while.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.514
He goes home to grow up, and
I think we go somewhere, too.

39:09.515 --> 39:10.616
- Where?

39:10.649 --> 39:12.484
- A surprise.

39:12.518 --> 39:13.785
[Aaliyah] I love surprises.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.387
- ETA on the boys?

39:15.421 --> 39:16.922
- Wheels down 1600.

39:16.955 --> 39:17.989
- They'll have to catch up.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.928
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.563
[music]

39:43.849 --> 39:45.551
- You're really bad
with make up.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.053
- I told her that.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.088
- Don't worry.
I'll help you on the plane.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.523
- The plane?

39:51.557 --> 39:52.724
- Don't spoil it.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.026
[speaking Arabic]

40:00.932 --> 40:02.668
[Joe] This isn't the way
to the airport.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.503
She said plane and the
airport is behind us.

40:06.672 --> 40:09.575
They're going
to the fucking FBO.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.909
I'm gonna need a tail number.

40:13.144 --> 40:14.713
Fuck!

40:45.911 --> 40:47.546
- Yeah, that's great, Tex.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.647
No one's going to
see you out there.

40:52.951 --> 40:56.454
[Tex] November-878-Foxtrot-Lima.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.068
- N9109, is that
a type of plane or something?

41:10.101 --> 41:11.469
- It's the tail number.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.971
Like a license plate
for planes.

41:13.004 --> 41:16.675
- Yay! You're going to be
so much fun to spoil.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.046
- She thinks on her feet.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.514
- That she does.

41:22.548 --> 41:24.415
Get me a flight path.

41:24.449 --> 41:26.785
I need a jet ready to travel.
We're one hour out.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.186
No destination yet.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.721
Tex, we got it.
Come back.
