WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
- OKAY, MA,
HERE YOU GO.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.400
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.500
- OH!

00:05.500 --> 00:08.100
- THIS ONE'S FROM ME,
ROBERT, AND DAD.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.067
- OH, A PRESENT
FROM MY SWEET, SWEET BOYS.

00:12.067 --> 00:13.400
AND FRANK.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.467
[gasps]

00:19.467 --> 00:20.733
OH!

00:23.633 --> 00:26.433
MY MOTHER HAD
FIGURINES LIKE THESE,

00:26.433 --> 00:28.533
AND I USED
TO STARE AT THEM,

00:28.533 --> 00:30.133
HOPING THAT MAYBE,
WHEN I GREW UP,

00:30.133 --> 00:31.433
THEY COULD BE MINE.

00:31.433 --> 00:34.300
BUT ONE DAY, THEY ALL BROKE.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.633
MY MOTHER FELL INTO THEM

00:35.633 --> 00:38.500
WHEN I TOLD HER
I WAS MARRYING FRANK.

00:40.433 --> 00:44.000
BUT NOW I HAVE
MY VERY OWN SET.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.300
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.733
- AH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
- OH, HONEY.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.000
COME HERE, FRANK.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.367
- LET'S NOT RUIN
THE MOMENT.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.067
- OH, MY...

00:57.067 --> 00:58.867
YOU SPENT SO MUCH.

00:58.867 --> 01:01.533
- MA, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT, ALL RIGHT?

01:01.533 --> 01:03.467
- BUT $240?

01:03.467 --> 01:07.700
- THOSE THINGS COST $240?

01:07.700 --> 01:09.033
- IT'S FINE, ROBERT.

01:09.033 --> 01:11.200
- NO, NO, NO.
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.867
HOW COME
YOU TOLD ME AND DAD

01:12.867 --> 01:14.667
THAT WE ONLY HAD
TO PAY $30 EACH,

01:14.667 --> 01:18.567
WHILE YOU PAID ONE--
ONE HUNDRED--

01:19.700 --> 01:21.833
WHILE YOU PAID THE REST?

01:21.833 --> 01:23.267
- ROBERT,

01:23.267 --> 01:25.067
YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T CARE
WHO PAID WHAT.

01:25.067 --> 01:26.800
SIT DOWN.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.067
- FRANK, YOU ONLY PAID $30...

01:30.067 --> 01:32.067
AND RAYMOND PAID $180?

01:32.067 --> 01:35.167
- $180, YES!

01:35.167 --> 01:37.367
- I JUST PAID
WHAT RAY TOLD ME TO.

01:37.367 --> 01:39.433
- SKIMPING ON YOUR WIFE'S
BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

01:39.433 --> 01:43.133
MY MOTHER WAS RIGHT
TO FALL DOWN.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.967
- SO YOU HAD TO PAY MORE
THAN US, HUH?

01:44.967 --> 01:46.933
YOU HAD TO HOG
ALL THE GLORY?

01:46.933 --> 01:48.967
GLORY HOG!

01:48.967 --> 01:50.100
- NO, IT JUST--

01:50.100 --> 01:51.733
I CAN AFFORD IT, OKAY?

01:51.733 --> 01:53.667
I'M DOING GOOD; THAT'S ALL.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

01:53.667 --> 01:56.233
- "I'M DOING GOOD; THAT'S ALL.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL."

01:56.233 --> 01:58.367
YOU JUST HAD
TO SHOW ME UP, RIGHT?

01:58.367 --> 02:00.333
- THANKS A LOT, RAY.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.000
- I'M PAYING 1/3, OKAY?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.433
SO I OWE...

02:05.433 --> 02:08.067
- $80.
- $80. YES, $80.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.600
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST CALM DOWN.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.733
- NO. I ALREADY PAID $30,
SO I OWE...

02:11.733 --> 02:15.300
- $50.
- I KNOW, $50!

02:15.300 --> 02:18.600
- FINE, PAY ME WHATEVER.
JUST STOP BEING A JERK.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.833
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE THESE FIGURINES BACK.

02:21.833 --> 02:25.200
THEY SHOULD BE
IN A HAPPY HOME.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.633
- NO, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:27.633 --> 02:29.267
- 'CAUSE EVERY TIME
I LOOK AT THEM NOW,

02:29.267 --> 02:30.767
I'LL THINK OF
YOU BOYS FIGHTING.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.167
TAKE THEM BACK.

02:32.167 --> 02:33.633
- COME ON, MA,
I'M NOT TAKING THEM BACK.

02:33.633 --> 02:35.200
- TAKE THEM BACK.
THEY'RE TAINTED.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.833
- I'M NOT TAKING THEM BACK!

02:37.833 --> 02:41.100
YOU'RE KEEPING 'EM,
AND YOU'RE GONNA CHERISH 'EM!

02:42.933 --> 02:45.633
I SPENT WEEKS TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT TO GET YOU, WEEKS!

02:45.633 --> 02:47.800
AND THEN I REMEMBERED YOU
TALKING ABOUT YOUR MOM

02:47.800 --> 02:49.133
AND HER FIGURINES.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.300
YOU THINK
IT'S A COINCIDENCE

02:50.300 --> 02:52.200
THAT I GOT
THE SAME EXACT ONES?

02:52.200 --> 02:53.533
I REMEMBERED!

02:53.533 --> 02:55.500
THEN I WENT TO EVERY
ANTIQUE SHOP IN THE CITY

02:55.500 --> 02:59.400
UNTIL I FOUND
THE LITTLE BASTARDS.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.233
I DIDN'T CARE
HOW MUCH IT COSTS

03:01.233 --> 03:02.767
BECAUSE IT'S
WHAT YOU WANTED.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.733
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO TAKE 'EM BACK?

03:04.733 --> 03:07.433
I WON'T.

03:07.433 --> 03:10.133
I JUST WON'T DO IT.

03:13.667 --> 03:16.467
- SO YOU TWO DIDN'T EVEN HELP
PICK THEM OUT?

03:16.467 --> 03:18.600
- NO, NO,
I--I HELPED.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.733
I WRAPPED IT.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.300
- DON'T LIE, ROBBIE.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.667
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU CAN'T
WORK A TAPE DISPENSER

03:23.667 --> 03:26.033
WITH YOUR GIANT FINGERS.

03:28.533 --> 03:29.800
- NICE JOB, RAY.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.400
LETTING HER KNOW
YOU PAID MORE WASN'T ENOUGH?

03:32.400 --> 03:34.433
- IT WAS ALL
PART OF HIS PLAN--

03:34.433 --> 03:37.700
TO FIND THE GLORY
AND THEN HOG IT.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:39.167 --> 03:40.767
I'M SORRY I BOUGHT
THE DAMN THINGS.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.500
- WELL, I'M SORRY MY BIRTHDAY
WAS AN INCONVENIENCE.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.733
- NO, MA,
I DIDN'T MEAN--

03:44.733 --> 03:45.767
- YOU TAKE THEM BACK.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.167
I CAN'T LOOK AT THEM!

03:52.867 --> 03:54.833
- WELL, RAYMOND,

03:54.833 --> 03:56.533
NICE GOING.

03:56.533 --> 04:00.233
YOU RUINED THAT
OLD CROW'S BIRTHDAY.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.633
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.900
YOU KNOW, I TRY TO DO SOMETHING
NICE AND THOUGHTFUL,

04:11.900 --> 04:15.167
AND IT'S LIKE I KILLED
MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.200
- YEP.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.933
VERY, VERY THOUGHTFUL.

04:21.933 --> 04:23.367
- WHAT?

04:23.367 --> 04:25.000
- HMM?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.167
NOTHING.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.433
NO, I GUESS I WAS
JUST SURPRISED

04:29.433 --> 04:31.500
AT HOW THOUGHTFUL
YOUR MOM'S GIFT WAS.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.067
BUT I SHOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED

04:33.067 --> 04:35.267
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS
PUT A LOT OF EFFORT

04:35.267 --> 04:37.033
INTO THE THINGS
THAT YOU BUY...

04:37.033 --> 04:39.367
FOR HER.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.567
- GOOD NIGHT.

04:46.867 --> 04:49.633
- NO, NO, RAY, LISTEN,
I THINK IT'S GREAT

04:49.633 --> 04:51.600
THAT YOU GOT YOUR MOM
SOMETHING NICE.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.100
I DO.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.833
I JUST SOMETIMES
WONDER WHY YOU DON'T

04:54.833 --> 04:57.033
PUT THE SAME THOUGHT
INTO THE THINGS YOU GET FOR ME,

04:57.033 --> 04:58.600
BUT IT'S OKAY.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.700
I DON'T CARE.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL OR ANYTHING.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.100
I'M NOT MAD.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.167
RAY?

05:07.367 --> 05:09.000
RAY?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.600
- [snores]
- RAY!

05:10.600 --> 05:11.733
- OW! WHAT?

05:11.733 --> 05:13.700
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T MAD.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.000
- I'M NOT!

05:15.000 --> 05:17.533
- I'VE GOTTEN YOU
PLENTY OF THOUGHTFUL STUFF.

05:17.533 --> 05:20.133
HUH? YOU'RE NOT
MAKING ANY SENSE.

05:20.133 --> 05:22.633
MAYBE YOU'RE DELIRIOUS
FROM LACK OF SEX.

05:28.767 --> 05:31.967
- YOU MOSTLY GET ME
GIFT CERTIFICATES

05:31.967 --> 05:34.433
AND BACK RUB IOUs

05:34.433 --> 05:36.633
OR STUFF THAT I'VE HAD
TO HINT THAT I WANTED,

05:36.633 --> 05:39.600
LIKE--LIKE THESE PAJAMAS,
FOR INSTANCE.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.800
- YOU NEVER HINTED
ABOUT THOSE PAJAMAS.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.133
- I GAVE YOU THE COLOR,

05:43.133 --> 05:44.967
THE SIZE,
DIRECTIONS TO THE STORE,

05:44.967 --> 05:46.800
DIRECTIONS FROM
THE FRONT OF THE STORE

05:46.800 --> 05:48.300
TO THE PAJAMA DEPARTMENT.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.500
I STILL HAD TO RETURN THEM

05:49.500 --> 05:51.767
'CAUSE YOU GOT
THE WRONG ONES!

05:53.767 --> 05:57.167
- SEE, IF YOU SLEEP NAKED,
WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM.

06:03.233 --> 06:04.633
COME ON, LOOK.

06:04.633 --> 06:06.400
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE, LIKE, DYING

06:06.400 --> 06:09.500
FOR SOMETHING
SUPER THOUGHTFUL.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.067
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WANT
TO GET ME THOUGHTFUL THINGS.

06:13.067 --> 06:15.233
COME ON!

06:17.400 --> 06:19.667
- I HAVE TO RETURN THESE.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.767
[scoffs and chuckles]

06:25.767 --> 06:27.267
- WHAT?

06:27.267 --> 06:28.300
- NOTHING. IT'S...

06:28.300 --> 06:29.767
I CAN'T WIN.

06:29.767 --> 06:31.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
ARGUING ABOUT THIS

06:31.667 --> 06:32.933
WHEN I HAPPEN TO HAVE

06:32.933 --> 06:35.000
A PRETTY GOOD CHRISTMAS GIFT
FOR YOU THIS YEAR.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
- HUH.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.600
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.467
I DON'T BLAME YOU
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

06:39.467 --> 06:40.867
BUT I DO;
I REALLY DO.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.567
- YEAH, RIGHT.

06:42.567 --> 06:43.800
- NO.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.200
YOU AND I WERE
DOING SOMETHING A FEW WEEKS AGO,

06:46.200 --> 06:47.967
AND IT GOT ME TO THINKING--

06:47.967 --> 06:49.767
WHATEVER.
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

06:49.767 --> 06:50.933
- WHAT?

06:50.933 --> 06:53.133
WHAT WERE WE DOING?

06:53.133 --> 06:54.500
- WE WERE IN THE CITY,

06:54.500 --> 06:56.300
AND WE WERE WALKING,
AND YOU SAW SOMETHING,

06:56.300 --> 06:57.933
AND YOU SAID, "OH, MY GOD."

06:57.933 --> 06:58.967
- YEAH?

06:58.967 --> 07:00.933
- YEAH...

07:00.933 --> 07:03.300
AND MAYBE I BOUGHT YOU
SOMETHING.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.600
- WHAT IS IT?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.367
- YOU'LL SEE IT;
YOU'LL SEE IT AT CHRISTMAS,

07:08.367 --> 07:11.367
AND...LET'S HOPE
YOU FIND IT THOUGHTFUL.

07:16.533 --> 07:18.500
GOOD NIGHT.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.667
- I'M SORRY, RAY.

07:23.833 --> 07:26.033
- IT'S OKAY.

07:44.067 --> 07:45.167
- [laughing]

07:45.167 --> 07:47.000
[doorbell rings]

07:52.100 --> 07:53.567
- RAY, HI.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.367
- HEY!
HI, AMY.

07:55.367 --> 07:57.367
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:57.367 --> 07:58.767
- I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

07:58.767 --> 08:02.200
THOUGHT I'D POP IN AND SAY,
"HOWDY-DOODLE."

08:03.600 --> 08:06.000
- "HOWDY-DOODLE"?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.867
WHAT ARE YOU,
HITTING THE EGGNOG?

08:08.867 --> 08:11.267
- STOP, ROBERT.
COME ON IN, RAY.

08:11.267 --> 08:14.567
- OKAY.
THANK YOU.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.467
SO...BOY.

08:16.467 --> 08:19.100
'TIS THE SEASON, HUH?

08:19.100 --> 08:23.567
ONLY TWO SHOPPING DAYS
LEFT TILL CHRISTMAS.

08:23.567 --> 08:28.600
EVERYBODY'S ALL HOLLY AND JOLLY
AND BUYING STUFF.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.733
YOU BUYING ANY GIFTS
THIS SEASON, AMY?

08:31.733 --> 08:33.300
- OH, YEAH, I LOVE SHOPPING.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.133
I'VE GOT ONE MORE THING
TO GET MY UNCLE JEFF,

08:35.133 --> 08:36.567
AND SINCE HE JUST RETIRED--

08:36.567 --> 08:39.767
- THAT'S GREAT.
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN...

08:39.767 --> 08:41.600
I WANTED TO GET SOMETHING

08:41.600 --> 08:44.567
REALLY SPECIAL FOR DEBRA
THIS YEAR, YOU KNOW?

08:44.567 --> 08:48.033
'CAUSE SHE'S
JUST SO GREAT.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.233
- OH, I KNOW.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.667
DEBRA LOVES PAJAMAS.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.500
- NO, NAH.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.000
NO PAJAMAS.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.533
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:58.533 --> 09:00.267
GET OUT!

09:06.933 --> 09:10.567
- I JUST--I JUST WANT TO GET HER
SOMETHING THOUGHTFUL.

09:10.567 --> 09:13.433
YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING THAT SAYS,

09:13.433 --> 09:18.300
"DEBRA, YOU MEAN
SO MUCH TO ME,

09:18.300 --> 09:22.167
AND THIS GIFT MAKES ME
THINK OF YOU."

09:25.233 --> 09:27.667
SO WHAT DO YA GOT?

09:27.667 --> 09:29.733
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
WAIT A MINUTE.

09:29.733 --> 09:31.467
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

09:31.467 --> 09:32.767
A FEW WEEKS AGO,

09:32.767 --> 09:35.433
HE GOT MY MOM SOMETHING
THOUGHTFUL FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

09:35.433 --> 09:36.967
NOW I BET HE HAS
TO GET DEBRA

09:36.967 --> 09:40.433
A GIFT OF EQUAL
OR GREATER THOUGHT.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.533
- YOU'RE VERY THOUGHTFUL, RAY.

09:43.533 --> 09:45.400
YOU SHOULD TRUST
YOUR OWN INSTINCTS.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.100
- YEAH? 'CAUSE I DID
THINK OF SOMETHING.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.667
YOU KNOW HOW DEBRA'S
ALWAYS SAYING

09:48.667 --> 09:49.967
SHE'S ALWAYS COLD?

09:49.967 --> 09:52.133
SO I THOUGHT, "WHAT IF
I GET HER THIS REALLY GREAT,

09:52.133 --> 09:54.800
"TOP-OF-THE-LINE,
PRIMO...

09:54.800 --> 09:57.300
SPACE HEATER?"

10:01.767 --> 10:04.833
TOP OF THE LINE.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.233
FOUR SETTINGS:

10:06.233 --> 10:09.533
LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH...

10:09.533 --> 10:11.600
OFF.

10:17.433 --> 10:21.200
- RAYMOND, HAVE YOU EVER
EVEN MET YOUR WIFE?

10:21.200 --> 10:25.900
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HER?

10:25.900 --> 10:28.667
- I KNOW SHE GETS CHILLY.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.267
- HOW 'BOUT SOMETHING LIKE--

10:31.267 --> 10:32.533
SHE SPENT ALL

10:41.133 --> 10:42.600
OR A NICE PHOTOGRAPH
OF LAKE SAUGATUCK,

10:42.600 --> 10:44.600
OR SHE LIKES
CRAFTSMAN FURNITURE,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.333
OR SHE'S ALWAYS
MENTIONING HOW SHE WISHED

10:46.333 --> 10:48.000
SHE HAD MORE TIME
TO SPEND IN THE GARDEN,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.333
SO YOU GET HER
THE THINGS WITH--

10:49.333 --> 10:50.667
WAIT, WAIT, NO, NO.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.200
OKAY, THIS IS IT.
THIS IS IT.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.700
A FIRST EDITION
OF "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."

10:54.700 --> 10:56.833
ALL RIGHT, SHE DID HER
COLLEGE THESIS ON IT.

10:56.833 --> 10:58.233
IT'S HER FAVORITE BOOK.

10:58.233 --> 11:00.233
I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE'S GONNA LOVE IT.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.867

LOVE THAT, RAY.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.867
IT'S VERY NICE,
ROBERT.

11:12.867 --> 11:14.200
- OKAY, YEAH, I WAS THINKING

11:14.200 --> 11:16.367
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT TOO,
YOU KNOW, YEAH.

11:16.367 --> 11:17.800
I MEAN,
THAT OR THE SPACE HEATER,

11:17.800 --> 11:19.067
WHATEVER'S BETTER.

11:19.067 --> 11:21.533

11:33.400 --> 11:36.000
I KNEW IT WAS A BIRD BOOK.

11:38.467 --> 11:42.033
- NOW, WHERE WERE WE
BEFORE THE MONKEY CAME IN?

11:47.467 --> 11:48.967
[kids shouting]

11:48.967 --> 11:51.133
- CALM DOWN, HEY!

OPENED THEIR PRESENTS.

11:55.133 --> 11:56.733
THEY'RE EXCITED.

GRANDPA WANTS QUIET.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.300
- I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.533
- I KILLED A BIRD ONCE.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.733
- I HAVE TO TELL YOU, RAY,

12:58.733 --> 13:01.133
WHEN YOU TOLD ME YOU BOUGHT
SOMETHING THOUGHTFUL FOR ME,

13:01.133 --> 13:02.767
I DIDN'T
TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU.

13:02.767 --> 13:04.000
I'M SO SORRY.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.700
- IT'S OKAY.

13:05.700 --> 13:10.000
SEEING YOUR FACE NOW,
THAT'S LIKE YOUR GIFT TO ME.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.333

HARPER LEE WON
THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR THAT,

- YEAH.

13:29.067 --> 13:32.400
OH, GOD, THIS IS
SO WONDERFUL, RAY.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.633
- FRANK,

13:33.633 --> 13:35.333
WHY CAN'T YOU PUT
A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT

13:35.333 --> 13:36.333
INTO WHAT YOU GOT ME?

13:36.333 --> 13:39.767
- SLIPPERS ARE VERY THOUGHTFUL.

13:39.767 --> 13:42.933
EVERY DAY, I SEE YOUR FEET
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF BED,

13:42.933 --> 13:46.633
SO I THOUGHT,
AND I THOUGHT...

13:46.633 --> 13:48.400
AND I THOUGHT,

13:48.400 --> 13:52.367
"WHAT CAN I GET
TO COVER UP THOSE THINGS?"

14:00.200 --> 14:01.833
- YOU KNOW, RAY...

14:01.833 --> 14:03.367
WHAT WAS IT
THAT WE WERE

14:03.367 --> 14:04.967
DOING IN THE CITY
THAT REMINDED YOU

14:04.967 --> 14:06.533
OF "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD?"

14:09.600 --> 14:10.900
- WHAT?

14:10.900 --> 14:12.233
- REMEMBER?

14:12.233 --> 14:13.667
REMEMBER, YOU SAID
WE WERE IN THE CITY,

14:13.667 --> 14:16.067
AND I SAID, "OH, MY GOD!"
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:16.067 --> 14:18.433
- RIGHT. RIGHT.
WELL...

14:18.433 --> 14:21.233
WE WERE IN THE CITY,
AND YOU SAID, "OH, MY GOD,"

14:21.233 --> 14:25.667
BECAUSE...
OF ALL THE PIGEONS...

14:25.667 --> 14:29.500
THAT THERE WERE THAT DAY
IN THE CITY,

14:29.500 --> 14:34.300
AND I THOUGHT,
"PIGEONS...BIRDS...

14:34.300 --> 14:37.800
"OF A FEATHER
FLOCK TOGETHER...

14:37.800 --> 14:39.933
FLOCK, MOCK-ING BIRD."

14:39.933 --> 14:42.100
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

14:47.733 --> 14:49.733
- OH, WOW!

14:49.733 --> 14:51.700
- [whispers] WOW.

14:54.467 --> 14:55.667
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

14:55.667 --> 14:58.367
IT'S FUNNY HOW THE MIND
WORKS, ISN'T IT?

14:58.367 --> 15:02.200
- SO, UH, YOU DID YOUR THESIS
ON "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD,"

15:02.200 --> 15:03.367
DIDN'T YOU, DEB?

15:03.367 --> 15:04.867
- NEED SOME MORE COFFEE,
SWEETIE?

15:04.867 --> 15:06.167
- DEB?

15:06.167 --> 15:08.233
- OKAY, SURE, TWO SUGARS,
SUGAR.

15:08.233 --> 15:09.767
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GET IT.

15:09.767 --> 15:11.100
- I'LL COME WITH YOU.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.367
- DID YOUR THESIS--
OF THE MOCK--

15:12.367 --> 15:14.667
- HEY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:14.667 --> 15:16.367
I CAN'T WAIT TO PUT
THE KIDS TO BED TONIGHT

15:16.367 --> 15:18.567
SO I CAN START READING.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.400
- SO DID YOU
START YOUR BOOK LAST NIGHT?

15:29.400 --> 15:31.767
- NOPE,
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.733
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
YOU DIDN'T.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.000
- MERRY CHRISTMAS!
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.567
- HEY.
- HI.

15:38.567 --> 15:39.767
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.100
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.
HI.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.433
WE JUST CAME FROM
ACROSS THE STREET.

15:43.433 --> 15:46.100
IT'S NOT THE HOLIDAYS
UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN FRANK

15:46.100 --> 15:48.600
IN HIS SANTA FACE
UNDERWEAR.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.500
- DID YOU SEE WHAT
MY HANDSOME HUSBAND GAVE ME?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.900
FIRST EDITION
"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."

15:55.900 --> 15:58.100
MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BOOK!

15:58.100 --> 15:59.967
- HEY, GREAT GIFT.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.367
- I KNOW.
I LOVE THIS.

16:02.367 --> 16:03.900
OH, IT WAS SO NICE.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.333
- LOOK, I'M YOUR HUSBAND.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.167
- DON'T BE MODEST.
YOU GAVE ME THE PERFECT PRESENT.

16:09.167 --> 16:11.000
- YOU KNOW, I ALMOST WENT WITH
ANOTHER IDEA,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.600
SOMETHING FROM
LAKE SAUGATUCK.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.467
- LAKE SAUGATUCK?

16:17.467 --> 16:19.700
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVEN
MENTIONED THAT IN TEN YEARS.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.400
- YOU KNOW,
I GUESS I REMEMBERED IT

16:21.400 --> 16:24.033
'CAUSE I KNEW HOW IMPORTANT
IT WAS TO YOU.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.767
- OH!

16:27.667 --> 16:29.867
ISN'T HE TOO MUCH, HUH?

16:29.867 --> 16:32.033
- IT WAS ME!

16:35.567 --> 16:37.433
- WHAT?

16:37.433 --> 16:38.933
- YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
WITH ME!

16:38.933 --> 16:40.600
I TOLD HIM
TO GET YOU THAT BOOK!

16:40.600 --> 16:43.033
IT WAS MY IDEA,
NOT RAYMOND'S!

16:43.033 --> 16:45.133
ME, MINE, ALL ME!

16:45.133 --> 16:46.633
- ROBERT--

16:46.633 --> 16:48.800
- OH, YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF
"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD!"

16:48.800 --> 16:50.067
- OH, YES, I DID!

16:50.067 --> 16:51.167
- YOU DID NOT.
YOU NEVER READ THE BOOK.

16:51.167 --> 16:52.867
YOU NEVER SAW THE MOVIE!

16:52.867 --> 16:54.900
I BET YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THERE WAS A MOVIE ABOUT IT!

16:54.900 --> 16:56.833
HUH, WHO'S THE STAR
OF THE MOVIE, RAYMOND?

16:56.833 --> 16:57.833
- WHAT IS THE DIFF--

16:57.833 --> 16:58.967
- GREGORY PECK!

16:58.967 --> 17:00.200
GREGORY PECK!

17:00.200 --> 17:02.233
HE PLAYED ATTICUS FINCH,
GREGORY PECK!

17:02.233 --> 17:03.567
[imitating]
"ALL RIGHT, SCOUT,

17:03.567 --> 17:05.267
STEP ASIDE WHILE I SHOOT
THIS RABID DOG."

17:05.267 --> 17:07.600
HE WON THE OSCAR IN 1962!

17:07.600 --> 17:09.700
YOU MORON!

17:15.033 --> 17:17.767
- WHAT'S THIS GUY
TALKING ABOUT?

17:19.800 --> 17:22.533
- SO YOU TOOK CREDIT
FOR ROBERT'S IDEA?

17:22.533 --> 17:24.733
YOU MADE UP
THAT WHOLE CITY THING?

17:24.733 --> 17:26.133
YOU LIED TO ME?

17:26.133 --> 17:28.500
- YES, YES,
AND YES.

17:29.933 --> 17:32.333
- ROBERT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:32.333 --> 17:33.533
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:33.533 --> 17:35.367
- WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT
DEBRA KNOWS

17:35.367 --> 17:37.333
THAT THE BOOK
WAS YOUR IDEA?

17:37.333 --> 17:38.467
- BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.233
RAYMOND'S A GLORY HOG.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.100
HE DID IT TO MA,
AND NOW HE'S DOING IT TO DEBRA.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.533
HE'S GOT TO BE STOPPED!

17:46.033 --> 17:47.833
- YOU KNOW, ROBERT...

17:47.833 --> 17:50.300
I GOTTA SAY, THAT BOOK SEEMS
A LITTLE MORE THOUGHTFUL

17:50.300 --> 17:52.633
THAN WHAT YOU GOT ME.

17:52.633 --> 17:53.967
- WHAT DID HE GET YOU?

17:53.967 --> 17:56.733
- TICKETS TO THE ICE CAPADES.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.567
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

17:59.567 --> 18:02.500
THE ICE CAPADES
IS 2 1/2 HOURS OF FROZEN FUN.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.333
- ICE CAPADES?

18:07.333 --> 18:09.200
THAT'S WHAT MOM SAID
I SHOULD GET DEBRA.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.533
- THAT WAS
YOUR MOTHER'S IDEA?

18:25.533 --> 18:29.833
FOR ME, YOU HAD TO GO
TO YOUR MOTHER?

18:29.833 --> 18:32.667
- MAN, THAT IS LAME.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.267
I MEAN, RIGHT?

18:34.267 --> 18:35.900
- DON'T EVEN, RAY.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.167
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS,

18:37.167 --> 18:39.067
"WHAT SHOULD I GET
FOR MY MOM?"

18:39.067 --> 18:40.367
"YOU THINK MY MOM
WILL LIKE THIS?"

18:40.367 --> 18:42.300
"WHY DON'T
WE ASK MY MOM?"

18:42.300 --> 18:45.400
MOM, MOM, MOM, MOM, MOM.

18:47.067 --> 18:49.500
- HOW DO WE
GET OUT OF HERE?

18:51.300 --> 18:53.733
- COME ON, DEBRA.
YOU GOT YOUR BOOK.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.367
I GAVE IT TO YOU.
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.900
ISN'T IT THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS?

18:56.900 --> 18:58.733
- YEAH, BUT IT WASN'T
YOUR THOUGHT; IT WAS HIS.

18:58.733 --> 19:01.200
- YEAH, AND WHY DO YOU CARE
SO MUCH ABOUT HER GIFT?

19:01.200 --> 19:02.533
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT HER GIFT.

19:02.533 --> 19:04.133
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE HIM LOOK BAD.

19:04.133 --> 19:06.967
SORRY, MAN.
- IT'S OKAY; I UNDERSTAND.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.500
- YOU KNOW, RAY,

19:08.500 --> 19:10.467
I DON'T WANT YOU TO EVER GET ME
ANOTHER GIFT AGAIN,

19:10.467 --> 19:11.833
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
YOU DO,

19:11.833 --> 19:13.867
IT JUST MAKES ME REALIZE
HOW LITTLE YOU CARE.

19:13.867 --> 19:15.300
MERRY CHRISTMAS, RAY.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.067
- COME ON, NOW YOU'RE BECOMING
MY MOTHER.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.100
- WHAT?

19:20.833 --> 19:24.767
- LET ME FINISH!

19:24.767 --> 19:26.000
LOOK...

19:26.000 --> 19:27.600
THE ONLY REASON
I EVER PUT ANY THOUGHT

19:27.600 --> 19:29.433
INTO MY MOTHER'S GIFT
IS BECAUSE SHE'S, UH--

19:29.433 --> 19:30.833
- MATERIALISTIC.
- NO.

19:30.833 --> 19:32.300
- YES.
- YES!

19:32.300 --> 19:34.433
GIFTS AND STUFF,
THAT'S ALL SHE CARES ABOUT.

19:34.433 --> 19:35.867
I DON'T THINK OF YOU
THAT WAY.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.167
YOU ALWAYS USED TO SAY,

19:37.167 --> 19:38.567
"I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING

19:38.567 --> 19:40.233
AS LONG AS WE'RE ALL HAPPY
AND HEALTHY."

19:40.233 --> 19:42.700
AND LOOK AT US.
WE'RE ALL HAPPY AND HEALTHY.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.700
WE'RE ALL HEALTHY.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.533
FOR NOW.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.867
ISN'T THAT THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS?

19:51.867 --> 19:53.100
I MEAN, COME ON,
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

19:53.100 --> 19:57.167
WHAT ABOUT JESUS,
HUH?

19:57.167 --> 19:59.100
YOU THINK HE CARED ABOUT
GETTING A BUNCH OF GIFTS

19:59.100 --> 20:00.633
ON HIS BIRTHDAY?

20:00.633 --> 20:04.567
RUM-PUM-PUM-PUM,
THAT'S ALL HE WANTED.

20:06.100 --> 20:09.400
- THAT'S TRUE.
RUM-PUM-PUM-PUM.

20:12.067 --> 20:13.667
- LOOK, I'M SORRY I LIED.

20:13.667 --> 20:17.400
I--I LIED THAT NIGHT ABOUT
HAVING A GREAT GIFT FOR YOU,

20:17.400 --> 20:20.133
AND I LIED ABOUT COMING UP
WITH THE CUCKOO BIRD BOOK,

20:20.133 --> 20:22.733
AND--AND--

20:22.733 --> 20:23.900
I KNOW. I KNOW.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.700
I TOOK ALL THE CREDIT FOR IT.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.333
BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO THE ICE CAPADES.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.633
I'M SORRY.

20:36.633 --> 20:37.967
I STINK AT THIS.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.433
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

IN FACT, I WOULDN'T LIE
HALF AS MUCH IF I DIDN'T.

20:52.533 --> 20:53.467

20:53.467 --> 20:54.467
- HEY!
- HI, MARIE.

20:54.467 --> 20:55.867

20:55.867 --> 20:58.467
IT'S TIME TO RETURN
A FEW OF THE GIFTS I GOT

20:58.467 --> 21:00.933
THAT WEREN'T QUITE RIGHT.

21:00.933 --> 21:04.767
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING
THEY'D LIKE BROUGHT BACK?

21:10.900 --> 21:12.800
- NO. WE'RE FINE,
MARIE.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.000
- YEAH. WE'RE VERY HAPPY.

21:18.267 --> 21:20.833
HEY, MARIE, ISN'T THAT
THE BOWL I GAVE YOU?

21:20.833 --> 21:23.467
