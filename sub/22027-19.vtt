WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:01.653
.

00:01.697 --> 00:03.394
- That boy...

00:03.438 --> 00:04.308
We really did
a number on him.

00:04.352 --> 00:05.657
The moods, the women.

00:05.701 --> 00:07.616
When things get
a little rough,

00:07.659 --> 00:08.617
don't give up.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.140
- Yeah...

00:10.184 --> 00:11.620
- I hope me being here
isn't making things

00:11.663 --> 00:13.404
awkward for you
and Captain Casey.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.145
- He knows that the thing
between us was nothing.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.712
- It wasn't nothing
to me.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.324
- I am at that rehab
facility every morning

00:20.368 --> 00:22.457
at sunrise, even when it
hurts like hell.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.676
- Try not to put
a clock on all this.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.331
- Guess I didn't think
it would go so slow.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.469
- Hey, you
know a joke?

00:34.512 --> 00:36.297
If there were guys
on my team,

00:36.340 --> 00:38.168
I would have
tapped out by now.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.475
- It's not a competition.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.000
You been keeping up
with your P.T

00:44.044 --> 00:45.828
between these assessments?

00:45.871 --> 00:48.048
- Yeah.
Twice a day.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.832
Three times,
when I can.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.442
- Twice is enough.

00:51.486 --> 00:54.619
Close?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.534
- I have a few more tests
to put you through.

00:56.578 --> 01:00.060
Mind raising your arms
over your head, please?

01:00.103 --> 01:03.628
- Right. Sure.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.371
- Twelve past 7:00.

01:07.415 --> 01:10.026
Okay.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.073
Hey! Don't you dare
leave without me!

01:14.596 --> 01:16.337
- I'm not
going anywhere.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.517
- Okay.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.345
Hey, stop it.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.434
- You're gonna slow me down.
- No, we got time.

01:26.477 --> 01:29.654
I've got this morning drive
down to a science.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.788
- Yeah.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.151
- Morning, chief.
- Morning.

01:48.195 --> 01:51.154
Hey. How was
your assessment?

01:51.198 --> 01:52.634
- Doc was
hard to read.

01:52.677 --> 01:55.332
They said they'd call me
with the determination.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.293
I don't know,
I feel like every time

01:59.336 --> 02:01.947
I make progress,
they move the goalposts.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.080
- It's a process,
Otis.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.429
Don't give up.

02:06.604 --> 02:07.910
- Right.

02:12.175 --> 02:15.091
- Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.843
- I doubt they're
doing traffic control.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.676
- Okay, let's get
a line inside.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.286
- Morning, Chief.
- Morning.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.635
What am I looking at?
- Piece of Mexican

02:37.679 --> 02:39.507
Cartel property.
Rapidly oxidating.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.379
- Negative, uh--
electrical.

02:42.423 --> 02:43.772
Some heavy
equipment overheated.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.513
Happy accident.
Saved us a warrant.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.471
- Okay, I'm gonna need you
to keep your men clear.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.212
Until the blaze is out,
I'm in command.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.387
- Understood.
Just remember,

02:50.431 --> 02:51.867
every scrap of
evidence in there

02:51.910 --> 02:52.998
needs to be
accounted for.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.174
Still an active crime scene.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.305
- We'll do
what we can.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.612
Casey, you copy?
- Got it, Chief.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.179
Let's go.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.755
- This place is
a drug bank.

03:10.799 --> 03:13.105
Kidd, Cordova,
check the back halls.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.194
Herrmann and Mouch
with me.

03:14.237 --> 03:17.284
- Copy.
- Copy that.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.506
- Fire department!
Call out!

03:22.550 --> 03:25.248
- Fire department! Call out!

03:25.292 --> 03:26.728
Fire department, call out!

03:28.208 --> 03:30.340
Call out,
I'm not seeing you!

03:30.384 --> 03:32.212
God, the smoke!

03:32.255 --> 03:33.430
Help!

03:33.474 --> 03:35.737
- Hey! Hey, I hear you!

03:35.780 --> 03:37.652
I'm right here!

03:37.695 --> 03:39.567
I need you to
unlock the door!

03:39.610 --> 03:41.351
- I can't!

03:41.395 --> 03:44.398
It's the vault!

03:45.529 --> 03:48.140
- Cordova,
where the hell are you?

03:48.184 --> 03:53.015
â™ª

03:53.058 --> 03:54.886
Please!

03:56.236 --> 03:58.412
- Captain, Chief!
I need assistance!

03:58.455 --> 04:00.892
I got a victim stuck behind
a secure door.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.242
It's a two-person job!

04:02.285 --> 04:04.069
But--
I lost Cordova!

04:04.113 --> 04:05.114
- Copy.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.289
Severide!

04:06.333 --> 04:07.899
You get that?
- Yeah, Capp.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.728
Come with me,
bring your sledge.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.341
- Cordova!
Where the hell were you?

04:14.384 --> 04:15.907
- Sorry, Captain.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.387
Thought I saw something--
- Explain it later.

04:17.431 --> 04:18.606
Back up squad.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.348
- Yes, sir.

04:22.392 --> 04:25.134
- Call out!
- Stella!

04:25.177 --> 04:27.049
- Hurry!
I think we're losing her!

04:27.092 --> 04:28.398
I'm set!

04:28.442 --> 04:30.792
- Capp, let's bust out
the bottom corner!

04:33.403 --> 04:36.276
Go!

04:36.319 --> 04:37.625
- Yep.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.757
- Go!

04:48.984 --> 04:51.508
- Hey! Stella, what
are you doing?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.989
- Tell me
you wouldn't do the same!

05:08.308 --> 05:10.614
Stella!

05:10.658 --> 05:12.137
Help her out!

05:12.181 --> 05:13.530
- Come on, we got you.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.144
- Capp!
Take her!

05:22.365 --> 05:24.236
- Hey!
Here!

05:24.280 --> 05:26.804
I got you!

05:26.848 --> 05:27.805
Breathe!
Come on!

05:27.849 --> 05:30.547
- Come on!

05:32.549 --> 05:34.334
Still breathing,
but she's weak.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.727
- Right over here, guys.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.862
Can you hear me?
What's your name?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.254
- Marlena.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.344
I'm not supposed to be here.
They forced me to work.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.562
- You don't have to
explain anything.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.868
We're gonna take
good care of you.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.696
- Breathing's stable.
No need to intubate.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.698
- Good, let's get
her loaded up.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.006
- Hey, Casey.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.660
Excellent work today.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.532
Narcotics commander
asked me to express

05:58.575 --> 06:01.535
his personal appreciation
for our help.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.188
- Glad to be of service.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.234
Hey, Cordova.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.496
Check our O2 stocks.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.150
Curious to know
how much we used.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.282
- Got it, Captain.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.241
- So, uh...

06:12.284 --> 06:13.895
How's it been
working out?

06:15.897 --> 06:19.422
- Rocky start,
but things improved.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.206
Did more freelancing
on this last call

06:21.250 --> 06:23.383
than I would
have liked, but...

06:23.426 --> 06:25.733
Nothing worse than
Severide or I have done.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.779
- How well do you think
he'll fit in,

06:28.823 --> 06:31.042
if his detail becomes
more permanent?

06:32.566 --> 06:36.308
- Chief, Otis is--
- I know, Casey.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.528
I'm just asking.

06:38.572 --> 06:39.790
I mean,
Lord knows we'd all

06:39.834 --> 06:42.837
crawl through hell
for Otis, but...

06:42.880 --> 06:44.795
We have to be
clear-eyed.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.103
- Understood, Chief.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.677
- Who is at the scene of
the fire that occurred

06:56.720 --> 06:58.243
earlier this morning.
- Sources say--

06:58.287 --> 06:59.636
- Gotta be a hit
to the whole

06:59.680 --> 07:01.682
neighborhood drug
market, right?

07:01.725 --> 07:02.900
I'm sure it'll be

07:02.944 --> 07:04.728
back to business
as usual by Monday.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.470
- Hey, shows how knuckleheaded
these criminals are.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.603
They put all their eggs
in one basket.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.648
They lose everything.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.302
Should have diversified.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.173
- That'stheir problem.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.959
They need you managing
their portfolio, Herrmann!

07:18.002 --> 07:20.222
- It's basic money
management, all right?

07:20.265 --> 07:22.267
It's the perfect story
to use for Lee Henry.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.444
We're trying to
show him the value of money--

07:24.487 --> 07:26.184
- I'm sorry, Herrmann,
did you just say--

07:26.228 --> 07:27.925
- Mm...not worth it.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.580
- Hey, let me give you
an example, okay?

07:30.624 --> 07:32.843
Uh--Lee Henry,
he comes up to me

07:32.887 --> 07:35.933
and he asks me if he can
move into the apartment

07:35.977 --> 07:37.500
over the garage.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.154
Guess what I told him?

07:39.197 --> 07:42.287
- That he's too young,
that that's a terrible idea.

07:42.331 --> 07:45.160
- No, I told him...

07:47.249 --> 07:49.643
Make me an offer.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.603
Yeah.
Life lessons.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.216
- There you are!

07:59.870 --> 08:01.524
I thought you
were on a run.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.656
- Nah.

08:02.699 --> 08:05.615
Just staying in
the air for a minute.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.138
- How's life with
Severide?

08:07.182 --> 08:09.837
Saw the two of you stumble in
at the last minute today.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.275
- I won't lie.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.146
It is...

08:15.190 --> 08:16.539
It is hot.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.454
Well, that sounds like fun.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.414
- Yeah, his, uh--
his mom said something

08:22.458 --> 08:23.807
when she was
in town, though.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.896
She brought up
how Kelly...

08:25.940 --> 08:29.247
Can be fickle like his dad
when it comes to relationships.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.988
- I don't know, I think
Severide has moved past

08:31.032 --> 08:33.556
his wild life.
We've all seen it.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.645
- True. Even in the time
I've known him,

08:35.689 --> 08:39.083
he's come a long way
from his wedding in Vegas days.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.831
- Oh, I just--
I just meant, uh...

08:51.966 --> 08:53.489
- Don't look at me,
girl.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.015
- Ambo 61...

08:58.059 --> 08:59.451
- To be continued.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.367
- Oh, it better be.

09:05.414 --> 09:12.639
â™ª

09:15.598 --> 09:17.557
- You can stand down.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.471
- Gang hit.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.343
Five victims killed
execution style.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.736
No survivors.
- Angel!

09:22.779 --> 09:25.565
Please! My husband!

09:25.608 --> 09:26.653
My husband!
Please!

09:31.658 --> 09:35.226
"Ladron."
What's that mean?

09:35.270 --> 09:36.837
- Thief.

09:42.364 --> 09:42.538
.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.280
- There's a lot of activity
from the cartel since the fire.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.673
Rumor is, they had
more cash in that building

09:46.716 --> 09:47.717
than the news reported.

09:47.761 --> 09:48.805
Got shot-callers wondering

09:48.849 --> 09:50.111
what happened with the rest.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.156
They're convinced
$100,000 was stolen.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.463
- Amazing.
They lost millions to the cops

09:54.506 --> 09:56.291
but they're gonna
mow down the neighborhood

09:56.334 --> 09:57.553
over 100 grand?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.859
- It's a power thing.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.469
Gives them the chance
to draw blood.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.905
Reassert their position.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.298
They're gonna go
scorched earth until

10:03.341 --> 10:05.082
they find the thief
and reclaim the money.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.041
- What if the cartel don't
find the person responsible?

10:07.084 --> 10:09.870
That sounds
like a long shot.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.524
- Then we're in
for a bloody month.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.658
I'd do what you can
to be prepared.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.573
- I'll brief
the incoming platoon.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.315
We'll deal with
each step as it comes.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.882
Okay?

10:26.756 --> 10:28.149
- Doesn't feel right,
leaving shift

10:28.192 --> 10:29.629
with so much
up in the air.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.674
- Maybe there's something
we can do to help.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.633
Marlena?
The woman we saved?

10:33.676 --> 10:34.938
If this really is
an inside job,

10:34.982 --> 10:37.680
maybe she knows something
or saw something.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.421
- Or was involved.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.423
- I mean, if there's
any information she has

10:41.466 --> 10:43.294
worth passing
along to the police...

10:43.338 --> 10:45.209
It's worth having
a conversation.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.823
What?

10:49.866 --> 10:51.520
- You've got
that look in your eye.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.483
- I just feel like...

10:58.527 --> 11:00.094
- Hey!
It's not up for debate!

11:00.137 --> 11:03.837
I like my coffee from
a pot, not a pellet.

11:03.880 --> 11:08.102
- Fine. I'll drop it.
For now.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.985
- I have a question
for you.

11:22.029 --> 11:24.422
What?

11:25.467 --> 11:28.600
- Were you ever married
before?

11:41.091 --> 11:43.267
- It was a crazy time.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.577
When we first met,
I'd just lost my best friend

11:48.620 --> 11:52.146
and she had
just lost her sister.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.499
- At the time.
Maybe.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.941
- Well, it would have been
good to hear about it.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.553
- Sorry.

12:10.381 --> 12:14.516
- Are there any other surprises
that I should know about?

12:14.559 --> 12:17.475
Other ex-wives
you haven't mentioned?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.791
I'm just
putting it all out there.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.924
I was young.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.447
- But you're smarter now.

12:32.490 --> 12:36.103
You--you've got yourself
figured out, right?

12:38.627 --> 12:40.542
- I'm working on it.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.124
- You brought me
to the hospital.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.822
- I did, yeah.
How you feeling?

12:59.866 --> 13:02.129
- I'm okay.

13:02.172 --> 13:05.349
- Just came to talk to you.
If that's okay.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.134
- I don't know anything
about the drugs.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.179
I swear,
I-I just pack the money.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.964
- Oh, no, I'm--
I'm not with the police.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.140
I'm not trying to
get you in trouble.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.359
Actually, um...

13:16.708 --> 13:19.363
I need your help.

13:20.451 --> 13:21.888
Marlena, do you know
anything about money

13:21.931 --> 13:23.498
being stolen
from that house?

13:23.541 --> 13:25.848
Do the police
think I stole--

13:25.892 --> 13:29.069
- No. No, they don't.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.680
But the cartel believes
someone did.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.336
And right now,
they're on a hunt.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.512
People are dying,
so if you know anything,

13:37.555 --> 13:40.732
anything at all,
you can stop it.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.563
- Do you know what they do
to people who talk?

13:46.347 --> 13:48.523
Their families?

13:49.872 --> 13:51.743
Not just killing.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.616
They'll cut off your head.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.531
Your limbs.

13:59.969 --> 14:02.145
- I've seen more
than you might think.

14:03.407 --> 14:06.410
That's why I'm here.
I'm trying to save lives.

14:21.469 --> 14:23.166
Okay.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.476
- Someone tried
to kill me.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.133
It was dark.

14:33.176 --> 14:36.223
There was so much smoke.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.921
But I saw him.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.837
He was
holding something.

14:44.492 --> 14:47.234
- He was just a shape.

14:47.277 --> 14:50.324
A dark outline.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.238
Big.

14:51.281 --> 14:54.981
More than
six foot tall.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.940
Heavy coat.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.334
When he saw me looking...

15:00.377 --> 15:03.685
He rushed me.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.253
Pushed me into
that cage and shut it.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.127
It happened so fast,
I...

15:11.171 --> 15:13.825
I thought I was dead.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.615
- It's okay.

15:20.658 --> 15:23.923
We're doing everything we can
to find him, I promise.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.368
-Hey.
Gabby went to the hospital

15:34.411 --> 15:36.283
to check on a victim.
She'll be back soon.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.849
- I actually came to
talk to you.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.808
- I hear the cartel's
still out for blood.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.289
- Yeah, they dropped
three guys at a discount mall.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.421
Broad daylight,
families shopping.

15:44.465 --> 15:45.988
It's a miracle no one
else got hurt.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.556
- I went over
your incident report.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.819
I just wanted to make sure
I understood it.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.386
Where was the fire,
where was your team?

15:52.429 --> 15:54.605
- Fire was toward
the rear of the house.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.303
It spread through
the walls and ceiling.

15:56.346 --> 15:57.695
Herrman, Mouch, and I
searched the front

15:57.739 --> 15:59.480
where the counting
machines were.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.221
- And you found
one victim?

16:01.264 --> 16:02.613
- Guy in the bathroom.

16:02.657 --> 16:05.051
Coat with deep pockets?

16:05.094 --> 16:06.269
Places to hide cash?

16:06.313 --> 16:08.010
- Nope. We would
have caught it.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.318
- Kidd found a victim
trapped in a secure room.

16:11.361 --> 16:14.843
Right here.
Again, no cash on her.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.498
He find anyone on his search?

16:17.541 --> 16:19.630
- No, he and Kidd got
separated early on.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.154
Must have lost
track somewhere.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.242
- While they were
headed toward the back,

16:22.285 --> 16:23.460
in the direction
of the flames.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.027
- Yeah.
A few minutes later,

16:25.071 --> 16:27.638
I saw him come out
a rear door.

16:29.205 --> 16:32.078
- Must be.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.557
What?

16:33.601 --> 16:35.168
- Nothing.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.474
- Antonio, please.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.086
I'm responsible.
If-- if it concerns my unit,

16:40.129 --> 16:41.739
I need to know.

16:45.917 --> 16:49.051
- Hey, the basement is
looking great.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.531
Lee Henry
did a hell of a job.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.576
The boy's got hustle

16:52.620 --> 16:54.578
now that he has
an apartment to pay for.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.189
- Yeah, don't you think
he's a little young

16:56.232 --> 16:57.886
to be working
as a bar

16:57.929 --> 16:59.366
- No, a job's a job.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.716
Besides, he's a model employee.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.632
Always on time,
never have to remind him.

17:04.675 --> 17:08.201
- Yeah, but that doesn't
strike you as suspicious?

17:08.244 --> 17:10.377
- I don't know.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.249
At his age, only time
I was on my best behavior

17:13.293 --> 17:15.077
was when I was
up to no good.

17:15.121 --> 17:18.559
So, uh, I don't know,
you may wanna just...

17:18.602 --> 17:22.345
recheck the vodka bottles,
make sure they're still vodka.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.839
- Just heard back
from HQ.

17:37.882 --> 17:41.451
Doc says
I'm worse than I was last time.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.366
- How's that even
possible?

17:43.410 --> 17:44.498
- She says
I'm over-training.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.630
I'm pushing myself
too hard.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.676
- Oh...

17:48.719 --> 17:52.854
- Anyway...I scheduled another
assessment in a couple days.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.119
- Yeah, well,
clock's ticking.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.512
If I don't get back on
81 soon,

17:58.555 --> 17:59.904
I might not
get back at all.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.255
- Okay, but she told you
not to over-train.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.344
- Eh...
Short-term problem.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.823
- Otis, we all want you
back on truck,

18:05.867 --> 18:07.347
but it's not worth risking
your entire career

18:07.390 --> 18:09.653
to rush it, right?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.181
- Hey.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.444
We need to talk.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.795
- All right.

18:20.838 --> 18:21.883
What's up?

18:21.926 --> 18:23.145
- Is there anything
I need to know

18:23.189 --> 18:26.061
about yesterday's call?

18:27.323 --> 18:29.891
- The back room
had a stack of cash,

18:29.934 --> 18:31.893
sorted into
sequentially marked bundles.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.374
Police say three
of those bundles are missing.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.289
Presumed stolen.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.639
- Right.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.728
So I must have
stolen it.

18:40.771 --> 18:41.772
- You were the only
firefighter

18:41.816 --> 18:43.122
to set foot in that room.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.645
- You got
some nerve, Casey.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.606
Because if you did, now's
the time to say something.

18:49.650 --> 18:50.999
- Oh, so you're just trying
to look out for me.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.392
- I'm just offering you
a chance to--

18:52.435 --> 18:54.089
- Come on, be straight.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.134
You want me
out of your house

18:55.177 --> 18:57.397
and away from your wife.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.659
And you're willing to
drag my ass

18:58.702 --> 19:00.313
through the mud to do it.

19:00.356 --> 19:03.403
- If I were you, I'd think
before I said another word.

19:09.365 --> 19:13.195
- Call IED
if you wanna file a charge.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.155
But I'm not
listening to this.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.205
- I never accused Cordova.
I just asked him a question.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.599
- With some serious
implications, don't you think?

19:25.642 --> 19:27.035
Put yourself in
his shoes.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.602
- If I were in his shoes,
I never would have been

19:28.645 --> 19:30.081
in that part of the
building to begin with.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.735
- Oh, so you've never
broken reg on a call?

19:31.779 --> 19:33.259
- Not without
a damn good explanation.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.391
- Well, maybe you're asking
the wrong question.

19:35.435 --> 19:39.090
Marlena said that she saw
another person in the fire.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.788
Said that he--
he locked her in the room

19:40.831 --> 19:42.224
when she saw him
pocketing cash.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.008
- There were
no other victims.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.837
- I'm just telling you
what she saw, okay?

19:46.881 --> 19:49.362
She spotted a tall figure
with a heavy coat

19:49.405 --> 19:50.711
who forced her
into the room.

19:50.754 --> 19:54.802
- A tall figure--
what, about 6'3?

19:54.845 --> 19:57.457
Gabby,
don't take this the wrong way.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.980
But it's possible you're
letting your history with

19:59.023 --> 20:01.896
Cordova affect your ability to
see this objectively.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.420
- Or you are.

20:16.606 --> 20:16.998
.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.218
- Hey, hon!

20:19.261 --> 20:20.784
- I was wondering
if I could

20:20.828 --> 20:22.264
speak with you
for a moment?

20:22.308 --> 20:23.874
- You mind if I
get a couple of bites first?

20:23.918 --> 20:26.137
'Cause those bells can
go off any minute.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.791
- It's about Lee Henry.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.011
- Okay.
Is everything all right?

20:30.054 --> 20:31.317
Did he get hurt?

20:33.884 --> 20:36.278
- No.
He's not hurt.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.802
It concerns
your experiment.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.152
- You know,
if you want we could--

20:41.196 --> 20:44.155
- No, no.
Well, what is it?

20:46.027 --> 20:48.203
You can talk in front of
the guys; we're all family.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.379
- Eh, you know,
we'll just--

20:50.423 --> 20:51.946
- Fine.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.817
I just walked in
on your son

20:53.861 --> 20:55.471
watching pornography
in his apartment.

20:55.515 --> 20:56.733
- Yeah, we're gonna--

20:56.777 --> 20:58.474
Yep.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.999
- Um--

21:06.352 --> 21:09.093
- Thought Herrmann was doing
the equipment check today.

21:09.137 --> 21:12.314
- Uh, he was,
but, uh...

21:12.358 --> 21:14.490
We switched
'cause I just wanted

21:14.534 --> 21:16.492
some time to myself.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.844
- Yeah.

21:20.888 --> 21:23.847
Just, uh...

21:23.891 --> 21:25.545
Dumb stuff.

21:30.245 --> 21:34.205
Did you know that Severide
used to be married?

21:34.249 --> 21:36.338
- For what it's worth...

21:36.382 --> 21:39.994
She wasn't exactly
the love of his life.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.430
I wouldn't worry.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.215
- I'm not worried, I...

21:44.259 --> 21:47.218
I just hear stories like that,
and it freaks me out,

21:47.262 --> 21:50.483
because every time
I think I know the guy...

21:50.526 --> 21:53.224
I discover that
he's holding something back.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.185
- Yup...

21:57.925 --> 22:00.971
I understand
that feeling entirely.

22:02.712 --> 22:05.062
- I could see that.

22:05.106 --> 22:07.456
How do you manage?

22:09.110 --> 22:11.547
- By being patient
when I can.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.941
Honest when I have to be.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.596
It's not always easy.

22:17.597 --> 22:20.121
Gabby and Kelly both
have these little corners

22:20.164 --> 22:22.558
of themselves where
no one else is allowed.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.604
Not even us.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.087
Can't change them,
but...

22:30.131 --> 22:32.873
You set
your own standards.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.008
- Cordova's here,
and the Chief's ready.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.532
- Thanks.

22:44.014 --> 22:47.104
â™ª

22:50.804 --> 22:52.022
- You wanted to
see me, Chief?

22:52.066 --> 22:55.156
- Come on in.
Close the door.

22:58.942 --> 23:02.119
- That is your right.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.687
However, this is not
an official conversation.

23:04.731 --> 23:07.211
You're under
no obligation to participate.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.039
- I apologize for coming at you
the other night.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.476
I was out of line.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.000
My only interest now is
to get to the truth.

23:13.043 --> 23:16.046
- All of this is
off the record.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.309
- What do you
want to know?

23:21.182 --> 23:23.140
- At the fire last shift,

23:23.184 --> 23:26.143
I asked you
to stick with Kidd.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.754
Why didn't you?

23:29.364 --> 23:31.453
- You ever see
a ghost?

23:31.497 --> 23:34.543
Victim you thought was there,
but really wasn't?

23:34.587 --> 23:37.285
We were crawling the halls;
it was thick with smoke.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.895
Could have sworn
on my life,

23:38.939 --> 23:41.463
I saw someone.
I mean, I was sure of it.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.509
He moved away from me,
deeper into the fire.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.467
I looked back, he was
only a couple steps away.

23:45.511 --> 23:48.122
So I followed him.
Thought I could

23:48.165 --> 23:50.646
grab him quick, make the save--
and be back in time.

23:52.387 --> 23:54.911
- It was impossible
to see.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.000
He was about my height.

23:57.044 --> 23:59.002
I didn't catch
much more than that.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.135
- And you never found
any sign of him.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.573
- Like I said,
he was a ghost.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.488
I searched the room.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.099
He was nowhere.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.406
I know.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.886
I should have given
Kidd a heads-up.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.104
I should have stuck
to my orders--

24:14.148 --> 24:16.237
I got carried away.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.239
I just wanted
to show my hustle.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.720
Prove that I was
worth keeping around.

24:22.286 --> 24:25.551
I'll admit:
I'm guilty of that.

24:28.118 --> 24:31.034
But I'm telling you.

24:31.078 --> 24:33.210
That's all I'm guilty of.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.692
- Okay.

24:36.736 --> 24:39.695
Thanks for coming in.

24:39.739 --> 24:42.219
- Thanks.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.221
- Thanks, Chief.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.534
- This ghost of Cordova's,

24:52.578 --> 24:54.405
it matches
the description given to us

24:54.449 --> 24:56.190
by one of the other victims.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.757
- So you're saying
it's real.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.368
- I'm saying
it's possible.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.370
- Police were at
every exit of the building.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.241
No other bodies
were recovered.

25:04.285 --> 25:07.941
If there was another
man inside of that building,

25:07.984 --> 25:09.508
how'd he get away?

25:13.816 --> 25:15.557
- Dawson.

25:15.601 --> 25:16.776
You busy?

25:17.777 --> 25:19.474
Look, I hate to put you
in the middle of this.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.258
- Then don't.
- Please.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.565
I need to find out
if this thing's going to IED,

25:23.609 --> 25:25.915
if my career's in jeopardy
over some nonsense.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.264
- I wouldn't know.
- Right.

25:27.308 --> 25:28.701
But you're married
to the person who would.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.572
All right, please,
I'm--I'm asking you

25:30.616 --> 25:32.095
to stand by me and tell
these people who I am.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.357
- Jake, you've been here
for a month.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.663
I think
they know who you are.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.012
- Yeah, but--
- No, no, no, no, no.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.405
This needs to be said.

25:37.448 --> 25:38.449
You walked through
that door, day one,

25:38.493 --> 25:39.712
gunning for someone's job.

25:39.755 --> 25:40.713
- I smoothed that over.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.149
- And then,
to protect yourself,

25:42.192 --> 25:43.542
you asked me
to lie to my husband.

25:43.585 --> 25:44.325
- Not lying--

25:45.500 --> 25:46.632
What you said about
our past

25:46.675 --> 25:48.111
not being nothing?

25:48.155 --> 25:50.113
What am I supposed
to do with that?

25:50.157 --> 25:51.288
I'm not saying
I don't believe you.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.464
But if Casey
doesn't trust you,

25:53.508 --> 25:55.858
that's not all on him.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.601
- Truck 81,
Ambo 61.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.735
Auto accident,
3300 South Kedzie Avenue.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.488
- Baby stroller hanging
over the edge.

26:17.532 --> 26:18.620
- You've gotta be
kidding me.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.274
- It was
another gang shooting.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.710
Guy pulled up along-side
the driver and popped him.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.582
Car lost control,
went off the road,

26:23.625 --> 26:25.061
busted straight
through the guardrail.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.194
- Please! Help him!

26:27.237 --> 26:28.369
Don't let him fall!

26:29.718 --> 26:31.198
- Herrmann, I need a rope.
- Yeah.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.242
Right here, Cap'n.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.504
- I'll grab some back-up.

26:33.548 --> 26:34.505
- I'll make sure
the fence is secure.

26:34.549 --> 26:35.681
- Casey, I can reach--

26:35.724 --> 26:36.682
- Move back.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.205
Keep watch.

26:38.248 --> 26:39.510
- Got it.

26:41.295 --> 26:43.558
- All right.
Good to go.

26:50.347 --> 26:53.612
Come on...

26:56.353 --> 26:57.790
- Whoa!

27:02.272 --> 27:02.490
.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.800
- Okay.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.760
- There!

27:12.892 --> 27:13.849
Gonna get you out--

27:13.893 --> 27:16.243
There we go...

27:19.725 --> 27:22.162
- There, I got him!

27:23.424 --> 27:25.644
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Oh, my God!

27:25.687 --> 27:28.124
Thank you!
- You're welcome.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.561
- It's okay, baby.
Are you okay?

27:33.434 --> 27:36.263
- Great assist.
- Thanks.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.711
- You gotta lift it.

27:49.755 --> 27:50.973
That one hasn't
been the same

27:51.017 --> 27:54.585
since it got shot
a little while back.

27:54.629 --> 27:57.284
- All right.
Copy that.

27:59.721 --> 28:00.896
- Got hairy for
a moment,

28:00.940 --> 28:03.029
but, uh,
this team...

28:03.072 --> 28:06.162
You know, I been
floating for two years.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.816
Worked with
some solid smoke-eaters.

28:07.860 --> 28:10.776
I've never seen a crew
this much in sync.

28:12.386 --> 28:14.605
- I'm glad you get it.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.390
Not everybody does.

28:21.787 --> 28:25.007
- Hey, Otis.

28:25.051 --> 28:26.617
I'm rooting for you
on this next assessment,

28:26.661 --> 28:29.142
just so you know.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.857
Something wrong?

28:48.901 --> 28:52.034
- No.
Not wrong, exactly.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.168
I just want to say,
I really appreciate

28:55.211 --> 28:57.170
how supportive everyone's been
these past few weeks.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.389
It's something
I'll never forget.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.390
- Yeah.

29:00.434 --> 29:01.827
Of course.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.654
- There's more though,
um...

29:03.698 --> 29:06.396
If there's one thing
I've learned in my years at 51,

29:06.440 --> 29:08.311
it's that the work we do,
it's bigger than

29:08.355 --> 29:09.399
any one person.

29:09.443 --> 29:10.792
Finding someone
who really gets

29:10.836 --> 29:11.967
what this
house is about...

29:12.011 --> 29:14.056
That's a rare thing.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.624
You've got that
in Cordova.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.234
- You don't know
all the facts.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.322
- Maybe.

29:19.366 --> 29:20.846
But...
I really don't want to

29:20.889 --> 29:22.848
be the one
holding everyone back.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.240
So...

29:25.851 --> 29:27.417
If I don't get
my clearance this week,

29:27.461 --> 29:29.028
I plan to step aside.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.291
- Let's not
jump the gun.

29:31.334 --> 29:34.076
Go to your assessment,
get your results.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.035
We'll take it from there.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.082
- Thanks for hearing me out.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.780
- Yeah.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.308
Hey. Severide.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.527
I'd love another
pair of eyes

29:50.571 --> 29:52.878
on this incident report,
if you can spare them.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.618
- Yeah.
Happy to help.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.403
- Thanks.

29:57.491 --> 29:58.797
- So, when you're finished

29:58.840 --> 30:00.320
with the bathroom stalls,
you can move on

30:00.363 --> 30:01.190
to the bunk room.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.409
Dad, I just--
- Hey.

30:02.452 --> 30:03.671
No lip, all right?

30:03.714 --> 30:05.107
You decide
to put your brain

30:05.151 --> 30:07.544
in the toilet,
so be it, all right?

30:07.588 --> 30:10.286
Just consider this another one
of life's lessons.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.593
When you got
a good thing going,

30:12.636 --> 30:14.813
don't press your luck.

30:14.856 --> 30:15.814
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.337
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.644
- So what happens
to the apartment?

30:20.688 --> 30:22.385
- Eh, nothing.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.648
Goes back to being a home
for the Christmas decorations

30:24.692 --> 30:27.303
and the last couple of crates
of Vitamin Water.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.871
- Might want to
consider tossing those.

30:29.915 --> 30:32.526
- Either that,
or I rent the place out.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.136
Turn it into one of
those 'I-BnB,'

30:34.180 --> 30:36.095
or 'You-BnB,'
whatever type places.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.140
- Title of 'Landlord'
would suit you.

30:44.668 --> 30:47.106
- Hey, Herrmann.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.978
- How, uh--
How serious are you

30:50.022 --> 30:51.197
about renting
that apartment out?

30:51.240 --> 30:52.589
You know somebody

30:52.633 --> 30:53.590
that needs a place?

30:53.634 --> 30:54.635
- Sure.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.506
- Okay.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.073
- It's me.

30:58.117 --> 31:00.032
- But, I thought that
you and Severide were--

31:00.075 --> 31:02.643
- We are, we are.
But I'm...

31:02.686 --> 31:04.993
We moved in together...

31:05.037 --> 31:08.475
And we skipped
the dating part, and, um...

31:08.518 --> 31:11.130
I'm just starting
to think it was a mistake.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.437
- Gotta go with
your gut.

31:14.481 --> 31:17.223
If you want it,
it's yours.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.617
- Thanks, Herrmann.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.060
- We found something.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.235
- It's not a guarantee,
but it's

31:29.278 --> 31:31.541
definitely worth
a closer look.

31:32.629 --> 31:33.935
- Here.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.328
On the right,
you got the room

31:35.371 --> 31:36.720
with the stolen cash.
On the left,

31:36.764 --> 31:37.808
the adjacent bedroom.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.245
They share a wall.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.595
- You see
what we see?

31:41.638 --> 31:42.857
- Walls don't match.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.032
- Exactly.

31:44.076 --> 31:45.773
According
to this floor plan,

31:45.816 --> 31:46.905
this bookshelf
right here?

31:46.948 --> 31:47.906
It should be recessed.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.342
Three, maybe four feet.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.213
- Got unaccounted space
between the rooms.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.562
Could be a trap area,

31:52.606 --> 31:54.086
place where
the cartel would stash

31:54.129 --> 31:55.957
extra loot,
guns, whatever,

31:56.001 --> 31:57.654
in case of a raid.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.918
- If it's okay with you,
we'd like to take a look.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.528
Find out.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.096
- Let's go.

32:04.139 --> 32:10.972
â™ª

32:19.111 --> 32:20.982
- How would you feel
about coming inside?

32:21.026 --> 32:23.071
Walk us through
what you saw.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.986
- If you think
it could help.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.467
- I do.
- All right.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.605
I took the lead
as we moved to the back.

32:35.649 --> 32:38.130
Figured I could
estimate the layout, but...

32:38.173 --> 32:39.522
The way they have
this place set up

32:39.566 --> 32:41.481
got me turned around
pretty quick.

32:41.524 --> 32:44.875
- Where do you think
you lost Kidd?

32:44.919 --> 32:46.747
- Guessing
right about here.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.749
Which means...

32:48.792 --> 32:51.143
That's where I saw him.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.062
- How'd you end up
in this room?

32:57.105 --> 32:58.889
- I followed him
in here.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.587
Then he was gone.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.200
- Severide.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.550
- Yeah, I hear it.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.344
Hey, check this out.

33:26.787 --> 33:34.012
â™ª

33:38.668 --> 33:38.886
.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.410
- Found the missing
cash on the victim's body.

33:41.454 --> 33:42.629
Probably used
the fire as an excuse

33:42.672 --> 33:44.065
to make some money
disappear.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.675
You say you got a guy
who saw him on the call?

33:45.719 --> 33:47.764
- Followed him
into that room and lost him.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.332
He must have ducked into
the trap area to hide

33:50.376 --> 33:51.420
thinking he was safe.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.769
- Yeah, real sharp.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.251
- Now we work overtime
to put the word out

33:56.295 --> 33:57.731
that the money's been found.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.559
Tamp down on the violence,
shouldn't take long.

33:59.602 --> 34:01.300
- Whatever we can do
to help, let us know.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.780
- Hey,
you've done plenty.

34:15.966 --> 34:18.186
- I'm, uh...

34:18.230 --> 34:20.449
Sorry I doubted you.

34:22.451 --> 34:23.974
- It's okay.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.412
Shouldn't have thrown it
back in your face.

34:26.455 --> 34:27.717
Surprised that wasn't
the end of me

34:27.761 --> 34:30.111
right then and there.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.852
- On the contrary.

34:31.895 --> 34:35.725
Soon as we get back,
I'm gonna put a call in to HQ.

34:35.769 --> 34:38.772
Let them know that as long as
we've got a seat open...

34:40.121 --> 34:42.819
You're our guy.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.182
- Hey.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.967
I am ready to hit the road
whenever you are.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.143
- Yeah, just give me
a minute.

35:10.673 --> 35:14.764
- I, uh...
I meant to tell you

35:14.808 --> 35:17.680
that I spoke
with Herrmann about...

35:17.724 --> 35:20.640
moving into
his apartment upstairs.

35:23.512 --> 35:26.472
- I just don't
want to be...

35:26.515 --> 35:29.170
Another mistake.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.172
Another story about...

35:31.216 --> 35:32.782
moving too fast

35:32.826 --> 35:34.523
and burning out quick

35:34.567 --> 35:36.699
because we have done that
once before.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.179
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.007
Stella, if you're
talking about Brittany...

35:40.050 --> 35:41.530
We were married
for less than a month.

35:41.574 --> 35:43.706
It was...
The easiest annulment ever.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.534
It's like
it never even happened.

35:46.927 --> 35:50.191
- That's what concerns me.

36:11.517 --> 36:12.822
- No.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.911
Food should be
ready in a minute.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.175
- Going as fast
as I can.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.228
- Hey.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.143
Everything all right?

36:29.187 --> 36:30.492
- Yeah.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.929
Sorry to bother you
at home. I just...

36:32.973 --> 36:35.062
Wanted to swing by
and tell you in person.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.846
As much as I
appreciated you

36:36.890 --> 36:39.893
extending
my detail on 51...

36:39.936 --> 36:41.982
I think
I'm gonna have to pass.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.681
- 51's a great house.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.901
There's no place
I'd rather be, it's just...

36:47.944 --> 36:49.337
Feels like I've been
nothing but trouble

36:49.381 --> 36:50.556
since the day I arrived.

36:50.599 --> 36:51.905
- It's all in the past.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.036
- I know.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.560
But still.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.257
Sometimes things don't
work out the way

36:56.301 --> 36:58.128
you really wish they had.

36:59.956 --> 37:01.741
Doesn't help to dwell.
Gotta move on.

37:01.784 --> 37:06.093
Like I said,
wasn't an easy choice.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.617
- Well, I...

37:08.661 --> 37:11.185
Guess you have to do
what feels right.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.928
Just know I'm happy
to put in a good word.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.713
Anywhere you
want to go.

37:17.757 --> 37:19.889
- Means a lot.
Thanks, Cap.

37:22.762 --> 37:24.938
You're a lucky man.

37:24.981 --> 37:28.115
I hope you realize that.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.769
- I do.

37:29.812 --> 37:32.032
Every single day
of my life.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.668
- Of course.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.089
- Right here.

38:31.787 --> 38:34.181
- Yeah.
I'm ready.

38:47.673 --> 38:54.897
â™ª

39:02.731 --> 39:04.080
Hi.

39:09.564 --> 39:12.088
- I am.

39:12.785 --> 39:15.614
Doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.398
Or us.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.834
In fact,
it's the opposite.

39:18.878 --> 39:21.881
I-I don't want things
to change.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.578
And that's why
I think that this--

39:23.622 --> 39:25.058
- Stella.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.323
I don't care
where you live.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.895
Wherever you are,

39:35.938 --> 39:38.201
that's where I want to be.

40:00.876 --> 40:01.094
.

40:03.792 --> 40:11.017
