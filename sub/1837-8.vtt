<i>My Love For Shoes.</i>

By Raven Baxter.

00:09.233 --> 00:15.200
"So many shoes,
but only two feet.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.367
"I wish I could buy
every pair that I meet.

00:20.934 --> 00:23.900
Wedges, sandals,
slingbacks and mules..."

00:27.767 --> 00:29.000
Thank you, everybody.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.033
This has always been
a dream of mine.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.500
That was so cool!

00:39.667 --> 00:41.233
And I'm still in school.

00:43.367 --> 00:45.100
I feel like a fool.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.400
I'll sit on my stool.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.033
Well, actually, it's a seat,

00:48.033 --> 00:49.567
but it rhymes with...

I'm telling you, Chels,

01:48.600 --> 01:50.400
this was an all-time
great vision.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.500
But what could it mean?

01:51.500 --> 01:52.667
I have no idea.

01:52.667 --> 01:53.700
Now if you don't mind,
I'm trying to read

01:53.700 --> 01:54.934
the new issue of
<i>Teen Look.</i>

01:54.934 --> 01:56.800
I was on a runway
at a fashion show

01:56.800 --> 01:58.500
in front
of a cheering crowd.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.934
Look, they're having
a clothing design contest.

02:00.934 --> 02:02.767
The winning design
will be modeled on a runway

02:02.767 --> 02:04.300
in front
of a cheering crowd.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.500
I felt so beautiful
and proud.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.367
You know what?
Whoever wins this

02:07.367 --> 02:11.100
is going to feel
so beautiful and proud.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.100
So cool.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.100
Give me that.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.700
(<i>gasps </i>)

02:15.700 --> 02:17.600
Chels, this is it!

02:17.600 --> 02:19.600
I'm going to be modeling
my own creations!

02:19.600 --> 02:21.100
I'm going to win
the contest!

02:21.100 --> 02:22.367
Okay, Raven.
Calm down.

02:22.367 --> 02:23.800
Now one thing at a time.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.800
Let's figure out
that vision.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.934
Three,

02:28.934 --> 02:31.800
two...

02:31.800 --> 02:32.767
one.

02:32.767 --> 02:34.233
(<i>gasps </i>)

02:34.233 --> 02:36.800
Oh!

02:36.800 --> 02:38.000
I knew you'd get there.

02:38.000 --> 02:38.467
Yeah.

02:38.467 --> 02:39.400
Come on.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.400
(<i>both squeal </i>)

02:43.767 --> 02:45.233
(<i>zapping </i>)

02:45.233 --> 02:48.600
William, did you upgrade
my video game system?

02:48.600 --> 02:52.233
Sorry, Cory, I'm a genius,
not a magician.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.200
I thought you could
fix anything.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.300
That is true.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.500
But I'm afraid
your Game Ball 1

02:59.500 --> 03:01.033
is hopelessly obsolete.

03:01.033 --> 03:04.200
There's only one solution--

03:04.200 --> 03:06.400
BOTH:
Your Game Ball 2.

03:08.467 --> 03:10.500
Cory, you have plenty
of money.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.967
Why don't you buy one?

03:11.967 --> 03:14.500
The first rule of money:

03:14.500 --> 03:16.900
"Never use your own."

03:19.000 --> 03:20.300
You boys having fun?

03:20.300 --> 03:22.300
Sadly, no.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.000
Cory's game system
is antiquated

03:26.000 --> 03:28.100
and technologically
inferior.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.000
Check you out.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.667
What an impressive vocabulary.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.700
The kids call him
"Captain Brainy Pants."

03:33.700 --> 03:36.300
Oh, how cute.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.500
Sadly, no.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.667
They call me that

03:40.667 --> 03:42.867
as they taunt me...
unmercifully.

03:42.867 --> 03:44.200
Well, don't you worry.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.500
One day those same kids
will be working for you.

03:48.834 --> 03:51.400
Wait until they hear
I don't have the Game Ball 2.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.867
You know what
they're going to call me?

03:52.867 --> 03:56.900
Hmm? Captain Greedy Pants?

03:56.900 --> 03:58.367
Ouch!

03:58.367 --> 04:01.500
That hurt.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.200
But nothing says sorry
like a Game Ball 2.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.667
(<i>laughs </i>)

04:05.667 --> 04:07.400
Forget it, Cory.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.900
The answer is no.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.834
Please, Mom?!
I got to have it!

04:10.834 --> 04:11.800
Cory!

04:11.800 --> 04:13.934
Mama, please,
I got to have it!

04:13.934 --> 04:15.600
Cory, you have a guest.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.300
Right! William,
grab the other leg.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.967
(<i>both pleading </i>)

04:33.233 --> 04:34.567
Can you believe this?

04:34.567 --> 04:36.400
I can be
in<i>Teen Look </i>magazine

04:36.400 --> 04:38.100
modeling the dress
I designed.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.900
I'm telling you, Rae,
you're going to blow up.

04:39.900 --> 04:40.934
I know.

04:40.934 --> 04:42.400
All you have to do
is beat out, like,

04:42.400 --> 04:44.400
hundreds and hundreds
of super-talented hopefuls

04:44.400 --> 04:45.934
who share the same
impossible dreams.

04:47.767 --> 04:49.133
But they

04:49.133 --> 04:52.300
didn't have
a vision.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.934
Which is cool 'cause...
Yeah, nice save.

04:53.934 --> 04:55.033
Uh-huh. Thanks, Chels.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.300
I'm going to go
change now.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.500
Okay.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.000
Chels, look
at that model!

05:03.300 --> 05:05.400
You think I have
a shot with her?

05:05.400 --> 05:07.000
Well, of course,
you do, Eddie.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.133
Come on.
Go get her.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.100
Be smooth.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.200
Be smooth.
Be smooth.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.867
Okay.

05:13.133 --> 05:15.100
WOMAN:
Emayshia, we need you
in wardrobe.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.934
Maybe half a shot.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.934
Hello, hopefuls.

05:26.934 --> 05:30.300
I'm Victoria Kayne,
former supermodel

05:30.300 --> 05:33.934
and current editor-in-chief
of<i>Teen Look </i>magazine.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.400
Today our judges will decide
which designers will move on

05:38.400 --> 05:41.834
to the finals
at our big fashion show.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.200
Now let's begin.

05:44.767 --> 05:48.200
Our first model is wearing
an evening dress designed

05:48.200 --> 05:50.100
by Lucy Ulrich.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.233
(<i>applause </i>)

05:56.233 --> 05:58.900
Don't they make
any models in my size?

05:58.900 --> 06:00.767
Our next model is...

06:08.100 --> 06:10.600
Yes, I know what you all
are thinking.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.767
Is this a Raven original?

06:15.300 --> 06:17.800
I'd be speechless, too.

06:17.800 --> 06:18.800
Excuse me.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.934
Aren't you the designer?

06:19.934 --> 06:21.300
This I am.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.934
Actually, everybody,

06:22.934 --> 06:26.400
I was designing
since I was in diapers.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.834
I used to design
my own diapers, in fact.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.867
I used to put
little glitter and sayings

06:29.867 --> 06:31.834
and, you know, little flowers.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.934
Try and add a little beauty
to the doody.

06:34.867 --> 06:36.867
Super.

06:36.867 --> 06:41.300
But where is your model?

06:41.300 --> 06:42.967
You're looking at her.

06:42.967 --> 06:46.367
I have always dreamed
of modeling my own creations.

06:46.367 --> 06:48.700
Ooh, honey,
you are working
that dress.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.467
Now that is something
I would buy.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.133
Well, when you do,
just don't rip out

06:52.133 --> 06:53.934
the little itchy tag
in the back.

06:53.934 --> 06:55.800
My name's going to be on it--
Raven Baxter.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.100
We may have a problem
with this one.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.567
(<i>crowd cheering </i>)

07:10.767 --> 07:11.867
Victor, you told me

07:11.867 --> 07:12.867
you couldn't clean out
the refrigerator

07:12.867 --> 07:13.900
because you were working out.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.200
I am.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.200
And flip, and chip,
and flip,

07:18.200 --> 07:20.734
and dip. Mm.

07:20.734 --> 07:22.767
And shake it out.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.233
You don't want to work out,
fine.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.300
But why'd you have to go buy
that Buff Guy 5000

07:26.300 --> 07:28.000
if you knew you weren't going
to use it?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.667
I use it.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.500
Mm-hmm. As a coat rack.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.367
Mom,

07:35.367 --> 07:36.500
I want to apologize

07:36.500 --> 07:38.500
for my childish behavior
the other day.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.900
Well, thank you, sweetie.

07:39.900 --> 07:43.033
Yeah, I've done
some growing up since then.

07:43.033 --> 07:46.567
And now I'd like
to state my case
in a mature way.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.600
What?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.300
Cory, we just bought
you Game Ball 1.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.600
Look, we can't keep
buying you stuff
that you don't use.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.400
Trust your father
on this.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.600
He knows what
he's talking about.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.600
I understand your concern,

08:08.600 --> 08:10.734
but I think
I can change your minds.

08:26.367 --> 08:28.800
Why does Cory need
the Game Ball 2?

08:30.867 --> 08:34.200
As we begin our...

08:36.400 --> 08:38.867
First, my life without the Ball.

08:38.867 --> 08:43.800
A life of exclusion,
ridicule...

08:43.800 --> 08:45.500
and ultimately... failure.

08:48.367 --> 08:49.467
(<i>typing </i>)

Oh, man.

Look, Cory,
if you really want
a Game Ball 2,

09:17.300 --> 09:19.300
then why don't you put
this much effort

09:19.300 --> 09:20.400
into raising your own money?

09:20.400 --> 09:22.400
You could sell
your Game Ball 1

09:22.400 --> 09:24.934
and all the other toys
you don't even play with.

09:24.934 --> 09:26.300
Okay, fine.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.233

the balloons.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.500
Let's check it out.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.600
Rae, let us see
the picture.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.100
(<i>clears throat </i>)

10:36.100 --> 10:37.600
Ms. Kayne.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.500
Oh, Raven,
congratulations
on making the finals.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.967
Yeah. Um,
my dress did,

10:42.967 --> 10:44.100
but my body didn't.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.033
Oh, don't thank me.

10:45.033 --> 10:46.400
We've got the best

10:46.400 --> 10:48.033
photo retoucher
in the business.

10:48.033 --> 10:51.300
Why did you make me
look super skinny anyway?

10:51.300 --> 10:52.200
I thought you liked
my design.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.600
My dear, we love
your design.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.467
We just don't love you
wearing it.

10:59.300 --> 11:00.233
Why not?

11:00.233 --> 11:02.500
Well, let's put it
this way:

11:02.500 --> 11:05.033
You just don't have
the look.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.033
Well, this is the only look
I have.

11:10.033 --> 11:12.200
What am I supposed to do?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.400
Well, here's how
it works.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.133
You're a designer.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.700
Emayshia, our cover girl,
is a model.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.133
Now, forget that
dress of yours

11:20.133 --> 11:23.467
and go and make a new one
in Emayshia's size.

11:23.467 --> 11:25.734
She'll model it
in the show next week.

11:25.734 --> 11:26.800
Emayshia?

11:26.800 --> 11:30.033
No, I make my dresses for me.

11:30.033 --> 11:31.867
You see, I kind of had this,
this vision

11:31.867 --> 11:34.667
where I was on the runway,
right, and I was hitting it.

11:34.667 --> 11:35.600
Let me tell you.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.500
And the lights
were flashing

11:37.500 --> 11:39.767
and I was bam,
bam, bam, bam!

11:39.767 --> 11:42.200
Sweetheart,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.600
the only way
that's going to happen

11:44.600 --> 11:46.400
is if you were a size two.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.400
Hey, girl, you're back.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.700
Yeah, I made it
in the finals.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.600
I knew it.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.500
I know a winner
when I see one.

12:12.867 --> 12:15.000
Wait, Rae,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.133
you want to get down
to a size two?

12:17.133 --> 12:19.000
Chels, I have to, okay?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.500
That vision was just so clear.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.834
I was up on that runway,
so I must have been a size two.

12:22.834 --> 12:24.967
Okay, you know what, Rae,
look...

12:24.967 --> 12:27.800
This... this is a size two.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.600
Chels, I mean,

12:31.600 --> 12:33.900
that's the look,
and...

12:33.900 --> 12:35.700
I want the look.

12:35.700 --> 12:40.867
And I'll do whatever it takes
to get... the look.

12:40.867 --> 12:43.100
Okay, Rae, wait a minute,
you're not going to do

12:43.100 --> 12:45.600
something stupid
like go on one of those
crash diets, are you?

12:45.600 --> 12:47.133
Girl, no.
Those things are dangerous.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.934
I'm going to exercise.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.100
Cool. You know what?
We could do it together.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.967
Hey, you want to jog down
to the mall and get some pizza?

12:53.967 --> 12:56.967
No, Chels, I got to do this
old school.

12:56.967 --> 12:58.133
Um, uh...

12:58.133 --> 12:59.500
You mean...?

12:59.500 --> 13:00.600
Yeah.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.600
I'm going to have to sweat.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.000
Ew.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.200
A lot.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.967
(<i>both crying </i>)

13:11.367 --> 13:13.934
According to my preliminary
calculations,

13:13.934 --> 13:15.967
our sidewalk sale

13:15.967 --> 13:17.800
should yield a hefty profit.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.200
If all that means I'm getting
the Game Ball 2,

13:21.200 --> 13:22.734
bring it on.

13:22.734 --> 13:25.200
What are you doing
on Dad's coatrack?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.867
I'm about to get
my workout on.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.800
I got to burn a whole lot
of calories

13:28.800 --> 13:29.867
in a little bit of time.

13:29.867 --> 13:32.033
Ah, thermogenesis.

13:32.033 --> 13:34.200
Yeah, whatever, little man.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.767
I'm just trying to fit
into a dress.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.033
No pain, no gain.

13:38.033 --> 13:40.000
Have you considered
a larger dress?

13:41.900 --> 13:42.900
I know that look.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.233
Let's book.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.934
(<i>clearing throat </i>)

13:53.600 --> 13:56.200
Beginner's workout.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.000
Arms, arms...

14:03.000 --> 14:06.300
legs, legs...

14:06.300 --> 14:07.500

14:07.500 --> 14:10.667
Oh, snap and a half abs,
arms, arms...

14:10.667 --> 14:13.233
legs, abs...

14:13.233 --> 14:16.600
Oh, Dad sprung for the built-in
spray-mister.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.800
Go ahead, Dad!

14:17.800 --> 14:19.400
This is easy.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.600
Let me put this up
a little bit more.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.700
Here we go.

14:22.700 --> 14:23.667
Moderate workout.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.367
Legs, legs...

14:25.367 --> 14:26.367
arms, arms...

14:26.367 --> 14:27.367
Mist.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.300
Yes, I am...

14:30.300 --> 14:33.300
(<i>buzzing </i>)

14:34.367 --> 14:36.300
Hey, fly, I'm trying
to work out here.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.734
Now get out of my way now.

14:37.734 --> 14:39.600
Fly, you better get away.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.500
Don't bother me.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.100
Don't make me hurt you, fly.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.233
Hey, I'm about to swat, fly.
You better...

14:54.300 --> 14:56.000
Extreme workout.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.667
Professional athletes only.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.900
(<i>screaming </i>)

15:03.900 --> 15:06.600
Sounds like your sister's
in pain.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.500
No, pain, no gain.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.934
(<i>Raven screaming </i>)

15:09.934 --> 15:13.767
Technical malfunction.
Technical malfunction.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.600
Technical malfunction.
Technical malfunction.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.400

Technical malfunction....

15:20.867 --> 15:26.500
Leg... arm... arm...
ab... ab...

15:39.834 --> 15:41.934
Who was I kidding?

15:41.934 --> 15:45.033
I'll never get
to model this dress.

15:47.700 --> 15:51.400
That was the stupidest vision
I ever had.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.033
(<i>sighs </i>)

15:53.033 --> 15:55.934
We didn't sell
one stinking thing.

15:55.934 --> 15:59.000
That was the worst
sidewalk sale ever.

16:01.867 --> 16:03.133
Let's face it, William,

16:03.133 --> 16:05.867
we're never going to get
the Game Ball 2.

16:05.867 --> 16:08.000
How could I have
miscalculated

16:08.000 --> 16:11.133
our profit margin
to such an extreme level?

16:12.367 --> 16:14.200
I hate myself.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.100
Excuse me.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.367
I'm looking for

16:18.367 --> 16:21.500
the "Mega outrageous
bargain extravaganza."

16:21.500 --> 16:22.500
You're looking
at it.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.300
Make me an offer.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.367
Oh, I'm not much
of a toy person.

16:26.367 --> 16:27.367
Besides, this is

16:27.367 --> 16:29.000
a box of crud.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.200
How much is this lamp?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.867
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't sell you that.

16:35.867 --> 16:37.367
I'll give you $20.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.133
Maybe I wasn't clear.

16:39.133 --> 16:42.367
I can't sell you that...
for less than $25.

16:49.033 --> 16:52.000
MAN:
Ten minutes, people.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.800
Don't worry, Rae,
you designed

16:58.800 --> 17:00.900
such a beautiful dress, and it
looks good on both of you.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.233
Yeah, but no one's going
to see me in it.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.367
Mm-hmm.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.767
Oh, hey, Mimi.

17:04.767 --> 17:05.967
Mm-hmm.

17:05.967 --> 17:07.867
Okay, attitude alert.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.100
I know.

17:09.100 --> 17:10.767
Mimi, hey,

17:10.767 --> 17:12.500
did I do something?

17:12.500 --> 17:15.000
Yeah. You sold out.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.100
I mean,

17:16.100 --> 17:17.500
I thought you were going

17:17.500 --> 17:18.834
to be wearing that dress.

17:18.834 --> 17:21.400
I wanted to, but
I wanted to win.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.600
And just once,

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
I wanted to see a regular person

17:23.600 --> 17:24.767
out there modeling clothes

17:24.767 --> 17:26.967
for regular people.

17:26.967 --> 17:27.967
What can I do?

17:27.967 --> 17:29.300
I don't have "the look."

17:29.300 --> 17:30.500
The...

17:30.500 --> 17:33.033
That may be

17:33.033 --> 17:36.000
"the look," but it's
not the only look.

17:44.834 --> 17:49.767
Welcome to<i>Teen Look Magazine's</i>

17:49.767 --> 17:52.100

fashion design finalists.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.233
Our first beautiful creation

18:05.233 --> 18:07.734
was designed by
Kayla Harrington.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.934
Isn't she super?

18:15.967 --> 18:19.967
Our next lovely original
was designed

18:19.967 --> 18:21.800
by Raven Baxter...

18:29.900 --> 18:31.600
What are you doing up here?

18:31.600 --> 18:33.100
I'm modeling my dress.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.667
You should not
be up there.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.100
Oh, I think
I should.

18:44.934 --> 18:46.600
My baby made that dress.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.900
And I made that baby.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.300
And I helped.
