WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.504
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...
Missing victim is

00:03.604 --> 00:05.139
21-year-old Jenni Moreno,
undocumented from Honduras.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.174
She fled a local gang
that forced her

00:06.274 --> 00:07.375
into becoming a drug mule.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.410
<i>Jenni was staying at
a safe house in Gardena.</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:12.012
<i>A friend of Luca's neighbor runs
it at her personal home.</i>

00:12.113 --> 00:13.714
Mrs. Sosa, we're trying to help.
Are you ready to help?

00:13.814 --> 00:15.383
Or would you rather we just
start searching your house?

00:15.483 --> 00:16.750
Deacon, back off.

00:18.052 --> 00:18.086
<i>Do you have any clue
the sacrifice that lady makes</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:20.188
<i>on a daily basis
just so young women</i>

00:21.222 --> 00:22.423
fleeing oppression and violence
get a chance?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.059
Those young women have no legal
standing living under her roof.

00:25.993 --> 00:26.727
They could be deported
at the drop of a hat,

00:27.695 --> 00:28.296
sent back to the very danger
they're fleeing.

00:29.130 --> 00:29.797
It must be so nice
throwing stones

00:30.798 --> 00:32.032
perched up in your tidy corner
of the world.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.790
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

02:20.841 --> 02:22.776
Wow. Wow, these relays keep
getting closer and closer.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.279
Yeah. Looks like we found

02:25.379 --> 02:26.680
our even pairings.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.881
Still always comes down
to sergeant versus sergeant.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.717
Sounded like time's even.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.718
Think Hondo wins this
for us on accuracy.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.286
Let's see.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.524
Looks like we...
have our first tie.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.192
I don't know.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.261
Did I see your toe
over the starting line, Deac?

02:40.361 --> 02:41.895
False start is
a two-second penalty.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.898
Hey, you guys want to go again,
I'm standing right here.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.668
No need. I'm all for sharing
this win with the team.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.870
Attaboy.
Nice work.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.872
Hey.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.741
So, what are you up to
for your weekend off?

02:53.841 --> 02:54.942
Family outing?
No, no.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.744
I got a private security gig
tomorrow.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.279
Ah, no rest for the weary.
No.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.513
Not when there's potentially

02:59.613 --> 03:00.948
four college tuitions
to pay for.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.416
Well, look, short notice--
I'm firing up the grill

03:02.516 --> 03:04.585
this Sunday.
Everyone's invited.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.287
Is everyone coming?
Yeah.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.521
It'd be good to see Annie
and the kids.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.457
Yeah. Count us in.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.458
All right, cool.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.892
Good stuff out there.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.561
Yeah.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.796
Hey, guys,
last minute, I know,

03:15.896 --> 03:17.765
but I got a VIP detail tomorrow.
I could use an extra body.

03:17.865 --> 03:18.966
Anybody interested?
Sorry, man.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.734
I'm running errands
all day tomorrow.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.202
Yeah, I already made plans
with Bonnie tomorrow,

03:22.303 --> 03:23.971
otherwise I would.
Okay.
I'm in.

03:24.071 --> 03:24.905
What's the gig?

03:25.639 --> 03:26.440
Just driving a client to Vegas.

03:27.140 --> 03:27.741
It's not that entitled heiress

03:28.676 --> 03:29.243
you drove that time
with Rocker, is it?

03:30.210 --> 03:30.244
Heard you wanted to
throw her out of the car

03:30.811 --> 03:31.779
ten minutes in.
Ugh.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.747
Thank God, no. No, this is
something Owen set up.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.416
Wealthy businessman,
super low-key.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.885
Sounds like a good time.
Sounds like a payday.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.353
Have fun, you guys.
All right.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.854
Win me some money.
Hey, thanks for the ask.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.356
You'll text me the details?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.424
Yeah, yeah, of course.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.259
Hey. Um, Chris,
got to admit,

03:45.359 --> 03:47.295
I was a little surprised
that you volunteered.

03:47.395 --> 03:51.599
I get the sense that you're,
uh, still upset with me.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.467
We may not see eye to eye
on the safe house,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.736
or what Mama Pina does, but...

03:55.836 --> 03:57.705
I can put that aside
while we're on the clock.

03:57.805 --> 03:58.806
I appreciate you coming
along for the ride.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.341
Hey, Vegas is a long drive.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.643
Maybe I can change your mind
by the time we get back.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.023
Would you like me to put on
some music, Mr. Velez?

04:16.123 --> 04:18.826
No, thank you.
I enjoy the quiet.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.629
This countryside
reminds me

04:21.729 --> 04:23.531
of old Western movies.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.499
That's all that was on TV
where I grew up.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.267
You make this trip a lot?

04:27.368 --> 04:30.938
No, no, um, occasionally
for work, but...

04:31.038 --> 04:32.540
I've got a wife and four kids.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.974
Sin City isn't really
the preferred destination.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.544
What about you,
Ms. Alonso?

04:36.644 --> 04:37.845
Do you like to,
uh, gamble?

04:37.945 --> 04:40.448
No. I get enough risk
in my day job.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.915
This isn't what you
normally do?
No, this is

04:42.015 --> 04:43.283
a part-time thing, actually.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.386
We're both
full-time LAPD officers.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.620
Police?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.556
Uh, so, you're both police?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.458
SWAT, actually.

04:50.558 --> 04:51.792
Oh, they didn't mention that
when I called.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.427
Only that you were
the best security

04:53.527 --> 04:54.662
that money can buy.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.530
We aim to please.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.798
You come to the States a lot?

04:57.898 --> 04:59.467
Yes, yes. For work.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.001
If you don't mind my asking,
Mr. Velez, what do you do?

05:01.935 --> 05:03.937
I help run a business in Mexico.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.840
Started small
and grew big over time.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.344
You're smiling. Why?

05:10.444 --> 05:13.313
Sorry, it's just,
you remind me of my Uncle Sarzo.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.748
He also started small.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.650
Made a life for himself
and, uh,

05:16.750 --> 05:17.885
my aunt Helena,
for me, too.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.088
Your <i>t√≠o</i> sounds
like a great man.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.023
Yeah. He really is.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.794
Oh, can we stop
at Lankford, please?

05:26.894 --> 05:27.995
There's nothing there.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.497
It's just an abandoned
ghost town.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.699
Yes, but I heard
they shot old movies there,

05:31.799 --> 05:33.000
like the kind I watched
when I was a kid.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.668
I want to take
some pictures.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.570
All right, well, if you
don't mind getting to Vegas

05:36.670 --> 05:38.038
a little later than scheduled,

05:38.138 --> 05:39.940
with Chris and I
still on the clock...

05:40.774 --> 05:42.510
It's worth it.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.045
All right, well,
you're the client.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.851
Hey, Owen, it's Deacon.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.853
Making a short
sightseeing detour.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.489
<i>Gonna push back our ETA to Vegas
by one hour.</i>

05:55.589 --> 05:57.024
<i>I'll keep you updated.</i>

06:05.999 --> 06:09.002
Looks like we're not
the only tourists.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.906
Are you concerned?

06:13.006 --> 06:15.943
Don't have any reason to be.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.478
Yet.

06:23.016 --> 06:26.854
There's a lot of off-road
sites all up around here.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.522
I'm sure that's
where they're headed.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.858
What are you thinking?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.760
It's just with this hill
up here, I...

06:32.860 --> 06:34.995
I can't see
what's ahead of us.

06:41.769 --> 06:42.970
Get down!

07:36.223 --> 07:38.626
We got to
unclip and get out now.

07:39.827 --> 07:40.961
They're probably
coming for us.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.095
Are you good?

07:42.195 --> 07:43.797
Yeah. You?

07:43.897 --> 07:45.666
I think my left shoulder's
dislocated.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.800
Miguel?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.602
I-I hit my head.
I'm okay.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.772
All right, we can't get out
this side.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.140
They'll pick us off.
No.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.575
We got to get out this way.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.709
Okay.
Okay?

07:55.809 --> 07:56.810
Okay.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.081
Ow.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.050
Chris, i-it's gonna take me
a while with this shoulder.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.653
Come on.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.188
Stay down, stay down.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.825
I smell gas.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.226
All right,
we need to move.
I'm trying.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.635
Chris,
you got a visual?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.271
Contact one o'clock!

08:30.744 --> 08:32.613
Our car's on fire!

08:32.713 --> 08:34.682
I need my rifle.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.890
We can't let 'em flank us!

08:42.990 --> 08:44.625
Get that open.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.685
What are we gonna do?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.321
Up there.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.923
We're gonna keep
you behind us.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.057
We're gonna use
the smoke as cover.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.726
All right. On my count!

09:18.826 --> 09:20.560
One...

09:20.661 --> 09:21.895
two... three!
Go!

09:24.932 --> 09:26.133
Chris!

09:27.701 --> 09:28.936
Deac!

09:44.852 --> 09:45.953
No bars. I can't call out.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.689
My phone's down at the SUV.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.091
There's no way for us
to reach Hondo or HQ.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.359
We're on our own.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.827
You don't
have to die out here!

09:53.927 --> 09:55.663
We just want Miguel.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.902
Who are those guys?
I don't know.

10:02.002 --> 10:02.903
Well, they know you.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.604
What's really going on?

10:04.705 --> 10:05.839
Kidnappers, maybe.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.008
I've been threatened before
but never like this.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.743
Hand him over!
You both can go!

10:09.843 --> 10:12.780
They might try to flank us,
draw us out in the open.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.314
We go on offense.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.850
But we're safe here.
They can't get to us.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.251
They're not going
to stop trying.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.853
This is your last chance!

10:19.953 --> 10:22.122
Give us Miguel
or die with him!

10:31.899 --> 10:33.033
Deac, your shoulder's bad.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.267
I need to pop it back in,
but that means

10:34.367 --> 10:36.069
we both have to lose our guns
for a minute.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.404
All right?
We-we don't have time for that.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.972
I see movement.
We got to pin 'em down.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.341
Keep 'em at the truck.
Roger that.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.823
All right. Let's move.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.324
I'm dry.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.161
Stay here.

11:19.813 --> 11:23.416
LAPD! Drop your weapon.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.334
Clear.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.203
These guys weren't trained
by just anyone, Chris.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.806
They're with
the Corrido drug cartel.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.207
They're narco-terrorists.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.010
Heavy hitters coming for Miguel
on American soil.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.244
Happens for a reason.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.747
You think our client
might know what that is?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.348
Miguel!

11:55.448 --> 11:57.184
Come on out!

11:59.052 --> 12:01.088
Deac, I got to fix that.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.400
Sorry in advance.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.108
Oh! Oh, good grief.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.509
Not even that makes you curse?

12:22.609 --> 12:24.077
No, no.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.245
Matthew's been swearing
a lot lately.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.847
Apparently he's getting it
from me,

12:26.947 --> 12:28.748
so I'm trying to get
in the habit of not swearing.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.783
Well, it works.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.384
Just to say it,
I think you and Owen

12:32.519 --> 12:33.320
are gonna owe me a little,
uh, hazard pay for this one.

12:34.121 --> 12:34.487
I'll talk to him,
I'll talk to him.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.156
Right now
we got to talk to Miguel.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.834
Hey, Hondo.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.869
Hey, Tan. You heard
from Deacon and Chris?

12:48.969 --> 12:50.337
No. Why, what's up?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.105
I just got a call from Deacon's
business partner Owen.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.307
He said he and Chris missed
a check-in and now they're MIA.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.809
And I'm guessing you haven't
been able to reach 'em?

12:55.909 --> 12:56.776
No.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.145
Owen said
they picked up the client

12:58.979 --> 12:59.446
at the Brixton Hotel
at 10:00 a.m.

13:00.380 --> 13:00.848
Then Deacon shot a message
talking about

13:01.681 --> 13:02.415
some type of detour,
and that was it.

13:03.216 --> 13:03.250
No way Deac would miss
a check-in

13:03.884 --> 13:04.551
unless something happened.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.319
And Chris either.
All right, uh,

13:07.454 --> 13:07.487
let me cancel my plans
with Bonnie. I'll see you at HQ.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.422
All right. Street's
gonna meet us there.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.892
All right.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.194
Corrido cartel <i>sicarios</i>

13:14.294 --> 13:15.495
coming after you
here in the States,

13:15.595 --> 13:17.097
hitting us this hard.
You got to be more

13:17.197 --> 13:18.866
than some kidnapping target.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.233
Who are you really? What do you
have to do with the cartel?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.434
It's complicated.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.903
Then give us the simple version.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.573
MAN
Fontes? Torre?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.812
Fontes, Torre?

13:33.513 --> 13:35.015
Looks like our shooters have

13:35.115 --> 13:36.516
some concerned friends.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.918
We answer it.

13:38.919 --> 13:39.920
Maybe we can find out
who these people are.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.192
Who's this?

13:45.292 --> 13:47.227
Who is this?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.899
Where are my men?

13:51.999 --> 13:52.933
They're dead.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.167
We killed them both.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.602
Can you get another frequency
on there?

13:56.603 --> 13:58.571
I think it's just
the one channel.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.308
Give me Miguel.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.944
He's who we want.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.346
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.982
Give me Miguel,

14:09.082 --> 14:10.450
and I will spare you two.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.253
If not, you both die.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.489
Well, that's funny.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.358
That's what the last guy said.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.227
Identify yourself.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.861
Who am I speaking to?

14:21.962 --> 14:23.630
My name is Rafa.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.399
Okay, Rafa.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.235
Well, we're not gonna
give you Miguel,

14:28.335 --> 14:30.103
but I am gonna give you
a warning.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.371
It's only a matter of time

14:31.471 --> 14:33.206
before the proper authorities
find you.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.508
You sound like a police officer.

14:36.609 --> 14:40.147
And you sound like someone
who knows when it's time to run.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.652
I've killed
many police officers before.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.254
Not like us.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.457
Maybe not yet...

14:50.557 --> 14:52.960
but the day is young.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.397
We got backup on the way.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.466
I don't think you want to
show your face around here.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.668
See you soon.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.238
All right,
last time, who are you?

15:05.338 --> 15:06.473
We're trying to help you.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.941
Who are you
to the Corrido cartel?

15:08.041 --> 15:11.011
I was their accountant.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.146
Great.
So when you said

15:13.246 --> 15:14.547
you helped grow
a small business,

15:14.647 --> 15:16.216
that was in what, cocaine?

15:16.316 --> 15:17.250
Heroin?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.451
I am a good man.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.686
I was forced
into a bad situation.

15:19.786 --> 15:20.920
Oh, come on, man.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.122
Please.

15:23.190 --> 15:23.690
Oh, so you were forced
to manage the cartel's books,

15:24.157 --> 15:25.392
what, at gunpoint?

15:25.492 --> 15:28.095
Like I said, it's complicated.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.296
All right.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.530
Well, we don't have much time.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.033
We got more <i>sicarios</i>
on the way.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.567
How far, you think?

15:36.503 --> 15:37.070
Well, this doesn't have
much range.

15:37.504 --> 15:38.638
Ten to 15 miles.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.409
No.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.311
Rafa's gonna bring
more men.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.713
And better ones than these.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.349
We can't stay here.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.718
That smoke will give away
our location.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.488
Lankford.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.224
That abandoned town
will give us cover.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.126
Better than being exposed
out here.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.363
Looks like you'll be getting
your wish after all, Miguel.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.010
We got anything yet?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.478
Yeah, you said Chris and Deacon
picked up their client

16:18.578 --> 16:20.247
at the Brixton Hotel, right?

16:20.347 --> 16:21.614
Mm-hmm.
Two men threatened a maid

16:21.714 --> 16:23.550
and some front desk staff
there looking for a guest,

16:23.650 --> 16:25.385
guy named Miguel Velez.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.355
Velez? That's Deacon
and Chris's client.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.989
Patrol units got called
to the hotel

16:30.090 --> 16:32.692
roughly 20 minutes after Deac
and Chris would've left.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.494
If those men were
only 20 minutes behind,

16:34.594 --> 16:35.762
they could've caught up with
Deacon and Chris in the desert.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.497
That's what we're
afraid of.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.166
All right,
we got to put a call out to CHP

16:39.266 --> 16:40.633
and local sheriffs to look out
for Deacon's ride

16:40.733 --> 16:42.569
on main and secondary routes
to Vegas.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.471
And let's do a deep dive
on this Miguel Velez

16:44.571 --> 16:46.773
and find out exactly
who wants him and why.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.376
Still no signal.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.111
I think our best bet
is to find good cover,

16:51.211 --> 16:52.279
stay out of sight.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.580
You want us to hide?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.182
That smoke is either a blessing

16:55.282 --> 16:56.316
or a curse.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.484
Might bring help,

16:57.584 --> 16:59.086
could attract the cartel, too.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.787
My business partner knows
we missed a check-in.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.523
We got to buy some time
until help comes.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.392
You want us to hide here?
From the cartel?

17:05.492 --> 17:07.260
I'm open to ideas.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.529
Look, we were prepared
to guard a businessman,

17:09.629 --> 17:11.498
not protect the money guy
for the cartel.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.100
But you'll still protect me,
right?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.801
Even though you think
I'm some kind of criminal?

17:14.901 --> 17:17.270
Are you trying to prove that
you're some sort of innocent?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.407
They didn't give me a choice.
I had to work for them.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.575
Or else they would've
killed me years ago.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.577
And sometimes
you have to do what's necessary

17:24.677 --> 17:26.213
in order to survive.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.547
Well, our job is
to protect you.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.182
We don't have to see eye to eye
to do that.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.817
Everything is different
where I come from.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.353
Politicians make money
off cartels.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.654
Cartels buy off politicians.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.423
We know how deep
the corruption lies, Miguel.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.426
Yet your people are
responsible for it.

17:39.526 --> 17:43.130
Demand for drugs,
flow of guns, contras.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.732
There are problems
on my side of the border, yes,

17:45.832 --> 17:47.667
but the source
of those problems

17:47.767 --> 17:49.836
always seems to come
from your side.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.838
All right, I'm not a big fan
of holier-than-thou speeches,

17:51.938 --> 17:53.806
but I can see
you're a man of faith.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.842
Me, too.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.112
Saint Benedict, right?

17:59.212 --> 18:00.847
Wasn't he asked if it was
possible to keep his hands clean

18:00.947 --> 18:02.715
while everyone else's
were dirty?

18:02.815 --> 18:06.319
When the day comes, I'm prepared
to be judged by God.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.554
He knows what I've done

18:07.654 --> 18:09.356
and who I am.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.191
We've shown you
who we are, too.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.425
When this is all over,

18:12.525 --> 18:13.860
will I be taken away
in handcuffs?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.495
Miguel, we don't enforce the law
in Mexico.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.729
There's gonna be some people

18:16.829 --> 18:18.165
that want to ask you
some questions.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.666
If you're a good man
like you say,

18:19.766 --> 18:21.401
you got nothing
to worry about.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.570
Might have to lay
some improvised traps

18:23.670 --> 18:24.804
close to our position.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.407
I need to use
the restroom.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.642
Fine. Don't go too far.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.314
You think he might
try to run?

18:34.414 --> 18:35.848
Well, it's 100 degrees,

18:35.948 --> 18:38.251
he's got no water, closest
town is 50 miles from here.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.623
Yeah, he might just be
stupid enough to try.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.294
We got to keep eyes
on the road.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.795
That place looks good.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.305
You were pretty eager
to come along on this.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.307
In spite of my company.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.377
Trying to save up.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.445
Could really use the cash.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.679
Oh, yeah?

19:06.779 --> 19:09.249
Something special?
Maybe a new ride?

19:09.349 --> 19:11.551
Desert getaway?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.920
You see anything?

19:17.257 --> 19:20.327
You're changing
the subject.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.467
I'm saving up to help Mama Pina

19:27.567 --> 19:28.801
and the women
at the safe house.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.204
Now you get why
I changed the subject?

19:31.304 --> 19:32.605
I know you don't agree
with me, but I can't just

19:32.705 --> 19:34.374
turn my back on these women.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.675
Hey, there are churches all over

19:35.775 --> 19:37.510
that offer help
to undocumented people

19:37.610 --> 19:39.646
at no cost.
There are other ways.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.481
They need someone
who knows their situation,

19:41.581 --> 19:43.182
lived through it.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.318
That safe house is
their best option.
All right.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.887
Well, it's your money, I'm not
gonna tell you how to spend it.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.489
But if it's bothering you
this much, something tells me

19:49.589 --> 19:50.823
there's more to the story.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.425
These women are going through
the same thing

19:52.525 --> 19:54.694
my Aunt Helena went through.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.663
Some people just want a chance
at a better life,

19:56.763 --> 19:58.965
and they need
all the help they can get.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.302
I didn't know
your aunt's story.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.903
But you know mine.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.838
It was rough.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.441
And without her,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.378
I'm just trying
to pay it forward.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.351
Hey, why don't you
go check on Miguel?

20:32.532 --> 20:33.733
Taking a leak, huh?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.735
Stumbled upon a buried
bag full of cash.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.904
What are the odds?

20:39.539 --> 20:40.707
This belongs to me.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.342
I'm the one who buried it here.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.443
It's my money.

20:43.543 --> 20:44.744
That you stole from the cartel.

20:44.844 --> 20:45.612
No.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.913
I earned it, all of it.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.715
I'm really trying
to trust you here,

20:48.815 --> 20:50.383
but it's one lie
after the other.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.619
About who you are, why
you wanted to come to this town.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.754
This wasn't about sightseeing

20:54.854 --> 20:56.489
or some love of movies.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.791
This was about picking up cash.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.928
Let's go.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.433
The real reason for this visit.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.304
Buried treasure.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.039
Nice find, Miguel.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.941
I didn't steal from the cartel.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.042
Then why are they
trying to kill you?

21:16.142 --> 21:18.778
Because I was trying to escape.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.713
I told them I went to L.A.
for business,

21:20.813 --> 21:22.014
and when I didn't return home
as planned,

21:22.114 --> 21:24.651
I'm sure they realized
I was running.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.286
The cartel does not
let you leave alive.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.456
So, we were your safe passage
to Vegas.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.058
What's there for you?

21:32.158 --> 21:35.562
Hopefully the first stop
in a new life.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.697
One without violence
and bloodshed.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.632
That's your escape plan?

21:39.732 --> 21:41.601
What else is in there?

21:41.701 --> 21:44.371
My insurance policy.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.406
Information on the cartel's business.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.408
Everything is on there.
After you escaped,

21:48.508 --> 21:49.876
you were trying to use this
as leverage?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.678
Threaten to release
this information

21:51.778 --> 21:52.979
if the cartel
ever came after you?
Yes.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.814
You should've told us
from the beginning.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.017
Back home a lot of
the police work for the cartel.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.019
I'm sure you're

22:00.119 --> 22:01.954
more afraid of them
than the narcos.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.457
If we were in Mexico,
you would just take the money

22:04.557 --> 22:05.558
and hand me over to the cartel.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.760
Well, we're not, Miguel.

22:07.860 --> 22:08.961
You need to trust us.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.730
But it's got to work both ways.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.100
You're right.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.805
Oh, no.
What?

22:20.607 --> 22:21.841
They're coming.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.410
Last place Deacon's SUV

22:23.510 --> 22:26.045
hit traffic cams was in Barstow
two hours ago.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.581
They should have hit
Baker 65 miles later,

22:28.681 --> 22:30.817
but they never showed.
Means they fell off the radar

22:30.917 --> 22:32.719
somewhere between
Barstow and Baker.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.587
That's a hell of a lot of sand.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.723
What's going on with the other
agencies looking for 'em?

22:36.823 --> 22:38.991
So far, nothing.
CHP and the local sheriff

22:39.091 --> 22:40.893
only have so many units
assigned to the area.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.862
The deep dive came back
on Deacon's client--

22:42.962 --> 22:44.931
Miguel Velez,
a Mexican national,

22:45.031 --> 22:47.366
suspected accountant
for the Corrido drug cartel

22:47.467 --> 22:48.735
going back ten years.

22:48.835 --> 22:49.936
A lot of
the Corrido's gunmen were

22:50.036 --> 22:51.871
in the Mexican Special Forces.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.172
If that's who's going
after Deacon and Chris,

22:53.272 --> 22:55.041
they may be up against some
of the best-trained <i>sicarios</i>

22:55.141 --> 22:56.809
in the game.
We could take a chopper
out there,

22:56.909 --> 22:58.044
do our own grid search,

22:58.144 --> 22:59.746
but this is too much ground
to cover.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.648
We need a better idea
of where they are first.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.884
Owen said that Deacon mentioned
a sightseeing detour.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.053
We got to look
at alternate routes--

23:07.153 --> 23:09.656
byways, fire roads and UCRs.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.959
They might not be someplace
other agencies are gonna look.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.762
It's on us.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.120
Can I ask you something?

23:42.154 --> 23:43.790
What do you think about
in situations like this?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.958
Do you think about your family?

23:46.058 --> 23:47.960
Uh, your <i>t√≠o</i> Sarzo

23:48.060 --> 23:49.729
and your <i>t√≠a</i> Helena?

23:49.829 --> 23:51.197
Yes.

23:51.297 --> 23:54.534
Do you think what would happen
if this doesn't work?

23:56.135 --> 24:00.473
If staying hidden and
the traps don't do the trick,

24:00.573 --> 24:03.476
there's always other actions
we can take.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.211
Failure is not an option.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.885
You think about your family...

24:12.985 --> 24:14.587
and what they would do
without you?

24:14.687 --> 24:16.556
Can't think about that.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.858
Worst case scenario
doesn't work for me.

24:25.832 --> 24:28.167
RAFA
Where are you, Officer?

24:30.236 --> 24:33.205
Where are you keeping Miguel?

24:37.744 --> 24:41.514
Where are you hiding, dead man?

25:14.280 --> 25:17.149
Do you have
enough ammunition?

25:17.249 --> 25:20.553
Depends on how much firepower
the other guys bring.

25:20.653 --> 25:23.556
Look, I'm sorry

25:23.656 --> 25:26.659
that I got you two involved
in all of this.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.061
Maybe you really were
just trying

25:29.161 --> 25:31.297
to do the right thing.
Hey.

25:31.397 --> 25:33.165
We've got company,
total of six men.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.034
We have five minutes, tops.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.540
Hey. You good?

25:41.641 --> 25:43.810
Yeah, it's just, private
security was supposed to be

25:43.910 --> 25:46.012
the safer job.
It's just...

25:46.112 --> 25:47.647
You're thinking about
Annie and the kids.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.048
Yeah.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.583
Knowing how much pain
they'd be in if I was gone.

25:50.683 --> 25:51.984
You can't think about it.
Can't help it.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.853
I mean, it's times like this,
I wish...

25:53.953 --> 25:55.888
You're lucky.
You-You're-you're not...

25:55.988 --> 25:57.056
you're not attached.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.591
I don't know about that.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.327
I'd rather leave behind
a legacy, like you.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.998
All right.

26:06.799 --> 26:09.068
Let's do this. Come on.

26:32.992 --> 26:36.328
Officer, are you there?

26:38.698 --> 26:39.932
Are you hiding,

26:40.032 --> 26:42.735
or did you run?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.372
Are you a brave man?

26:48.374 --> 26:50.743
Many brave men have begged me
for their lives.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.379
Women, too.

26:55.882 --> 26:58.217
How will you both beg?

27:03.790 --> 27:06.325
We covered our tracks
pretty well.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.260
Maybe we should wait 'em out.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.230
Rafa and his men are good,
thorough.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.799
They'll take their time
searching.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.000
They won't miss anything.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.002
If it comes to it,
we have a plan B.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.070
We take the fight to them.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.327
Someone's coming
from the north.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.295
That's CHP.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.064
If he'd come
from the other direction,

27:45.164 --> 27:46.833
he would've seen the bodies
and the SUV, called for backup.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.167
But he didn't.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.435
He has no idea he's
rolling into an ambush.

27:49.535 --> 27:50.770
Miguel.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.138
You stay here.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.306
Chris, let's move.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.775
All right, when you reveal
yourselves, then what?

27:55.875 --> 27:56.776
They have six men.

27:56.876 --> 27:57.910
You are only two.

27:58.010 --> 27:58.911
Thanks for the math lesson.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.747
I'm an accountant.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.363
What the hell?

28:43.890 --> 28:44.991
LAPD!

28:45.091 --> 28:46.225
Hold your fire!

28:46.325 --> 28:48.127
We're here to help!
Stay down!

28:49.595 --> 28:50.496
You hit?

28:50.596 --> 28:53.465
My arm! It's bad.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.476
Go.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.993
Were you able to call
for backup?

29:21.093 --> 29:22.795
I couldn't, radio's shot.

29:29.869 --> 29:30.803
That's two down!

29:30.903 --> 29:31.871
Your legs still good?

29:31.971 --> 29:33.005
Yeah.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.908
Deac! Come on.
Go!

29:38.244 --> 29:40.512
Come on.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.550
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

29:48.587 --> 29:51.090
Radios are out! No dice!
Get him out of here!

29:51.190 --> 29:53.292
Let's go, let's go.
Come on.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.199
Okay. Go in, go in,
right there, right there.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.001
Anyone comes through that door,

30:02.101 --> 30:03.235
you shoot 'em.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.370
What the hell is going on here?

30:04.470 --> 30:05.471
No time, ask me later.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.475
No luck narrowing down
Deac and Chris's location,

30:09.575 --> 30:11.410
but we eliminated
washed-out roads and trails

30:11.510 --> 30:12.912
with active motion sensors,

30:13.012 --> 30:14.914
so at least we're looking at
a smaller area.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.349
Well, chopper's on a
standby, ready to go.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.219
Still, it's just way too much
ground for us to cover.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.388
Mojave dispatch might
have something.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.490
They sent a CHP unit to check
on a report of smoke

30:24.590 --> 30:26.292
near an abandoned town
called Lankford.

30:26.392 --> 30:29.195
Now they can't raise him,
radio beacon's gone dead.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.930
Deac, Chris, now a chippy,

30:31.030 --> 30:33.099
all missing in the same section
of the desert?

30:33.199 --> 30:35.201
The town would be
a smart place to hole up

30:35.301 --> 30:37.203
and take cover
if they were in trouble.

30:37.303 --> 30:38.971
What are we waiting for?

30:39.071 --> 30:40.873
Let's move.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.220
<i>S√≠.</i>

31:08.267 --> 31:09.268
What's going on?

31:09.368 --> 31:10.536
They know where Miguel is.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.271
Two of them went around back,

31:12.371 --> 31:13.272
one of them's Rafa.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.907
You keep them occupied?

31:15.007 --> 31:16.375
Go!

31:53.312 --> 31:55.147
Miguel. Miguel!

31:55.247 --> 31:56.248
They know where you are.

31:56.348 --> 31:57.616
I need you to climb down.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.097
Miguel, climb down now.

32:20.339 --> 32:21.307
All right.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.941
Go, go, go, go.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.259
Deacon!

33:47.359 --> 33:49.361
Can you hear me?

33:49.461 --> 33:50.696
Deacon!

33:51.563 --> 33:53.499
How does he know your name?

33:54.733 --> 33:55.801
Chris.

33:55.901 --> 33:59.138
You and I should talk!

34:00.406 --> 34:01.740
Show yourself, Deacon!

34:03.675 --> 34:05.377
I have something of yours!

34:18.857 --> 34:21.293
Give Miguel, Deacon!

34:21.393 --> 34:22.828
And these two both live.

34:22.928 --> 34:27.065
The three of you
will all live, huh?

34:28.534 --> 34:30.536
I'm not negotiating.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.538
And Chris?
What about her?

34:32.638 --> 34:34.473
If the situation was reversed,

34:34.573 --> 34:36.074
I know she'd do the same thing.

34:44.316 --> 34:46.652
You are good people.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.861
Here.

34:55.961 --> 34:57.696
These are passports
for my wife and son.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.331
They're hiding in Las Vegas,

34:59.431 --> 35:02.468
waiting for me to get them
out of the country.

35:02.568 --> 35:05.604
That's a way
to contact them inside.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.707
Everything I did
with the cartel,

35:08.807 --> 35:11.510
I only did for them, I swear.

35:12.544 --> 35:13.612
Why are you giving me those?

35:13.712 --> 35:16.215
Because you cannot negotiate
for Chris,

35:16.315 --> 35:18.650
but I can.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.887
And if you and Chris survive...

35:21.987 --> 35:24.490
then you can make sure
my wife and son are safe.

35:24.590 --> 35:25.491
No.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.193
You can't do this, Miguel.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.694
It's a trap.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.596
They're probably gonna kill
all of us anyway.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.763
And if I don't do this,

35:31.863 --> 35:34.366
we will all definitely die.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.668
Including them.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.908
Rafa!
No, Miguel.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.693
Let them go, Rafa.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.395
The exchange is me for them.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.664
Give me the hard drives first,

36:05.764 --> 36:07.266
then she goes free.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.400
And him?

36:08.500 --> 36:09.868
Yes, him, too.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.670
What are you doing, Miguel?

36:11.770 --> 36:13.171
What I have to.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.807
You have me,

36:15.907 --> 36:17.676
now let her go,
let them all go.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.278
You stole information
from me.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.514
Tell me where it is.
It's somewhere safe.

36:22.614 --> 36:25.484
But if anything happens to me,

36:25.584 --> 36:28.820
that information will be sent
to the American authorities.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.290
You lie.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.625
Give it to me.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.295
I don't have anything to give.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.729
The deal is me for them.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.499
Then I'm changing the deal.

36:43.802 --> 36:47.205
Give it to me, or she dies.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.830
Good to see you.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.633
Got here as fast
as we could.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.803
Come here.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.775
Are you all right, Miguel?

37:57.943 --> 38:00.946
I am now, thank you.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.385
Come on, I got you.

38:09.421 --> 38:10.656
Nice shot!

38:10.756 --> 38:13.291
Now, where have I seen
that move before?

38:13.392 --> 38:15.527
Oh, yeah, you.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.296
Thank you.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.065
I hope it wasn't
too much a bother.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.401
Come on, it's no bother, man.
You know that.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.403
It's a family thing.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.837
Yeah.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.617
You work
with federal authorities,

38:38.717 --> 38:39.885
they'll work with you.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.087
Maybe with
the information you have,

38:42.187 --> 38:45.056
you'll be able to bust
the cartel for good,

38:45.156 --> 38:46.525
save more lives.

38:47.659 --> 38:48.394
And then the authorities
become your insurance policy,

38:49.595 --> 38:51.397
keeping you and your family safe
wherever you choose to go.

38:51.497 --> 38:52.998
It's a good deal.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.967
Thank you.

38:56.067 --> 39:00.439
I'll have the, uh, Las Vegas PD
pick up your wife and son.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.842
Bring 'em back to
our headquarters.

39:03.942 --> 39:04.810
God bless you.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.978
May He bless us both.

39:07.913 --> 39:10.749
And you, Chris... thank you.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.593
I'll make sure Owen knows

39:21.693 --> 39:23.562
that you earned your OT
and hazard pay today.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.697
Appreciate that.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.533
Hopefully it helps.

39:27.633 --> 39:28.834
A worthwhile contribution

39:28.934 --> 39:30.636
to the safe house.
You think it's worthwhile?

39:30.736 --> 39:32.738
I do if you do.

39:40.011 --> 39:44.450
I know that some people can't
control their circumstances.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.486
We all do what we have to do
to survive.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.456
I'm glad you feel that way.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.958
One other thing.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.494
You are going to leave behind
one hell of a legacy,

39:55.594 --> 39:57.629
already.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.666
Really, second to none.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.504
You handled your business
out here.

40:05.604 --> 40:06.772
I'm proud of you two.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.006
Y'all got a seat
on the chopper going home.

40:08.106 --> 40:09.074
Three of us will catch a ride

40:09.174 --> 40:10.742
back to L.A.
Sounds good.
