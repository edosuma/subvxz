34:40.142 --> 34:42.111
Paul, we lost you today.

34:42.144 --> 34:44.380
Oh, you lost me, Logan?
No, you didn't lose me, man.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.983
You never had me.
There was no cover team.

34:47.016 --> 34:49.885
No one was listening.
You hung me out to dry, man!

34:49.919 --> 34:52.021
Oh, and by the way,
someone did see us.

34:52.054 --> 34:54.991
A cop, thank you very much.
But you know what?

34:55.024 --> 34:57.994
I think I got you figured out,
man, yeah.

34:58.027 --> 34:58.995
See, you can't get
the Sarkissians

34:59.028 --> 35:00.229
if we arrest Ari now,

35:00.263 --> 35:02.131
but if we don't, well,
I'm the one that ends up

35:02.164 --> 35:03.966
eating the sins
when it goes to trial, right?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.269
You knew exactly
what kind of maniac Ari was

35:06.269 --> 35:07.403
when you sent me in,

35:07.403 --> 35:09.405
which is precisely
why there was no cover team!

35:09.639 --> 35:11.207
Because you don't think
you could be held accountable

35:11.240 --> 35:12.675
if you don't know
what's happening, right?

35:12.708 --> 35:15.144
I'm sure the details
will appear in your report.

35:15.177 --> 35:16.412
Oh, you're goddamn right
about that!

35:16.646 --> 35:18.114
You wanna hear
about my day, boss?

35:18.147 --> 35:19.682
It started out when we abducted
Sammy O'Malley

35:19.715 --> 35:20.883
at gunpoint
from his residence.

35:20.883 --> 35:22.018
Paul...

35:22.018 --> 35:23.753
Then Ari harvested
the young man's kidneys.

35:23.786 --> 35:25.288
- After which...
- Agent Briggs...

35:25.321 --> 35:26.322
We wrapped the body in a tarp
and burned it

35:26.322 --> 35:27.323
in the back
of a Lincoln Town Car!

35:27.356 --> 35:28.891
Stop speaking right now!

35:28.924 --> 35:32.328
Put all details of
your operation into your report!

35:32.328 --> 35:35.264
I did not ask you to discuss
the particulars.

35:35.298 --> 35:36.866
Uh-huh.

35:36.899 --> 35:39.635
Look at me, Logan!

35:39.669 --> 35:42.705
Sammy O'Malley is dead.
This operation is over.

35:42.738 --> 35:44.006
- Oh, over?
- Over.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.908
Over?

35:45.941 --> 35:48.411
Thousands, Agent Briggs.

35:48.644 --> 35:51.781
Thousands die every day
from the arms

35:51.814 --> 35:53.749
provided by
the Sarkissian family.

35:53.783 --> 35:56.886
This is larger than you!
It's larger than me!

35:56.919 --> 35:58.988
Now...

35:59.021 --> 36:01.057
if you find this job
is too taxing,

36:01.090 --> 36:03.426
I suggest you get yourself
a therapist,

36:03.659 --> 36:05.961
or you get yourself
a box of Kleenex.

36:05.961 --> 36:07.196
I don't care.

36:07.229 --> 36:09.765
Either way,
it is not over

36:09.799 --> 36:12.268
until it is over!

36:12.301 --> 36:15.037
Now get the hell out
of my office!

36:43.199 --> 36:44.767
Yeah, I'll hold.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.202
- They lost him?
- Yeah.

36:46.202 --> 36:47.937
I've sent notice
to border patrol,

36:47.970 --> 36:49.372
airports, trains,
all of that.

36:49.372 --> 36:50.973
So if Sid's gonna try
to leave the country,

36:50.973 --> 36:53.209
it's not gonna be easy.

36:53.242 --> 36:54.977
Why did you blow the op?

36:54.977 --> 36:56.679
I didn't blow nothing!

36:56.712 --> 36:58.647
Ask this dude.

36:58.681 --> 36:59.982
It wasn't an op.

36:59.982 --> 37:02.251
It was a suicide run.
Sid was never gonna talk.

You shitting me?
All right, I gotta run.

37:05.855 --> 37:07.923
The wife and the kid just got
on a flight for Andorra.

37:07.957 --> 37:09.692
- They're gone.
- No extradition.

37:09.725 --> 37:11.327
- This is his getaway plan.
- Come on, let's go.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.662
- All right.
- Hey.

37:15.264 --> 37:20.035
I just got my things back,

So you with us for good now

37:29.845 --> 37:30.946
(Mike)
I'm not cleared for duty,

37:30.980 --> 37:33.115
but I'll be back
in Graceland full-time.

37:33.149 --> 37:34.950
I don't know where he is.

37:34.984 --> 37:36.986
Well, all we can do is wait.

37:37.019 --> 37:40.156
- Everything kosher?
- Yeah, everything's kosher.

37:40.156 --> 37:41.724
Why is the house such a mess?

37:41.757 --> 37:44.860
- Thank you.
[door closes]

37:48.731 --> 37:49.832
I'm moving out.

- The house.

37:55.871 --> 37:58.274
I just put in
my transfer papers.

37:58.274 --> 38:00.276
DEA won't approve it
until Sid's behind bars,

38:00.276 --> 38:03.679
but, uh...it's happening.

38:03.712 --> 38:05.347
- What?
- You're kidding, right?

38:05.381 --> 38:08.017
You don't have to do this.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.386
Yeah...I do.

38:10.419 --> 38:11.921
Are these
your transfer papers?

38:11.921 --> 38:13.189
That? No.

38:13.189 --> 38:16.892
Uh, somebody at the DOJ
got ahold of the Lina letter.

38:16.926 --> 38:18.194
The one that, uh--

38:18.227 --> 38:19.895
They want to give you the award
for exceptional heroism.

38:19.929 --> 38:21.397
(Jakes)
No shit. I told you.

38:21.430 --> 38:23.032
(Charlie)
That's incredible, Paige.

38:23.065 --> 38:25.100
Yeah, incredible's kind of
the perfect word for it.

38:25.134 --> 38:27.236
Wait, okay, so you get an award,
and then you move out?

38:27.269 --> 38:29.004
That makes no sense
whatsoever.

38:29.038 --> 38:31.307
Paige wants out, guys,
she's out.

38:31.340 --> 38:33.909
She damn sure doesn't owe us
an explanation.

38:33.943 --> 38:35.778
Me and Mike
gotta talk to you in private.

38:35.778 --> 38:37.279
Yeah, no,
we all gotta talk, man.

38:37.313 --> 38:40.649
Where were you today?

38:40.683 --> 38:42.885
No answer?
All right, that's cool,

38:42.918 --> 38:46.989
'cause Paige almost got shot,
but whatever.

You know what, Johnny?
You're absolutely right.

38:50.659 --> 38:52.695
Come on, guys,
let me tell you about my day.

38:52.695 --> 38:54.430
Hmm?

39:01.670 --> 39:04.740
I spent one day
with Ari Adamian,

39:04.773 --> 39:07.042
and already I'm responsible
for a homicide.

39:07.076 --> 39:08.811
(Charlie)
You didn't kill the kid.

39:08.811 --> 39:11.213
No, Chuck,
but I'm the case agent now.

39:11.213 --> 39:14.216
When the Bureau rolls in,
starts making arrests,

39:14.250 --> 39:17.820
the truth comes out, when
it's all laid bare for a jury,

39:17.820 --> 39:20.356
somebody has to be held
accountable for Ari's crimes.

39:20.356 --> 39:21.690
They're gonna make you
stick it to him

39:21.690 --> 39:23.959
and then lay it all
at your feet.

39:23.993 --> 39:26.028
Yeah, pretty much.

39:26.061 --> 39:27.796
I'll be their sin-eater.

39:27.830 --> 39:30.199
Why don't you
just walk away?

39:30.232 --> 39:31.800
'Cause there are some things
you can't

39:31.800 --> 39:34.236
just walk away from, Johnny.

39:34.270 --> 39:36.705
I mean, hey, look,
every single one of us here,

39:36.705 --> 39:38.374
we've done some bad things,
right?

39:38.374 --> 39:41.176
Me more than others.

This is the penance
I gotta pay.

Sorry, I'm having trouble here.

39:45.748 --> 39:47.349
What's--what's Logan's play?

39:47.383 --> 39:50.653
The Sarkissians
are the upper echelon

39:50.686 --> 39:51.921
of international arms dealing.

39:51.954 --> 39:54.857
No one has ever
gotten under with them, so...

39:54.857 --> 39:59.128

to the top of the world.

Jesus Christ, Paul.

40:05.801 --> 40:08.070
Because that's what
you're here for.

40:08.103 --> 40:09.905
Hmm?

40:09.939 --> 40:12.374
Graceland doesn't exist
just because

40:12.374 --> 40:15.277
there were a few agents who
wanted an ocean view, you know?

40:15.277 --> 40:18.714
I mean, the house, it's--
it's pretty dope, right?

40:18.747 --> 40:21.884
But at the end of the day,
it's just walls.

40:21.917 --> 40:24.853
What gives it its value
are the people inside.

40:24.887 --> 40:26.956
That's us.

with the devil.

Now, thankfully,
there's always five people

40:35.731 --> 40:38.133
pulling the other way.

40:38.167 --> 40:40.836
So I guess
I'm telling you because I...

40:40.869 --> 40:42.871
I know already
it's gonna get a lot worse

40:42.905 --> 40:45.274
before it gets any better,
