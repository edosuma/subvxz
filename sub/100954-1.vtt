M_I_SForEver

01:25.663 --> 01:27.614
Trick or treat!

01:28.158 --> 01:33.565
Well, I think you both
deserve a treat.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.054
Night night.

02:08.447 --> 02:10.174
Get up.

02:10.719 --> 02:11.934
Now!

02:13.503 --> 02:14.463
Why?

02:14.527 --> 02:15.614
Come on, up.

02:26.365 --> 02:28.703
Look at our daughter, Greg.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.765
I know this isn't easy for you.

02:36.830 --> 02:39.102
Well, guess what, you
men don't have a monopoly

02:39.135 --> 02:41.278
on finding this family
life thing difficult.

02:41.310 --> 02:44.094
I used to be queen of the
party scene, and what am I now?

02:44.127 --> 02:45.855
A bleeding dairy cow.

02:45.887 --> 02:48.190
Stuck at home all day with an
infant.

02:48.223 --> 02:49.631
And that's you, by the way, not
her.

02:49.662 --> 02:53.023
So get yourself another
job and stop wallowing.

02:54.045 --> 02:56.029
I should be hunting mammoths.

02:56.061 --> 02:57.503
What?

02:59.774 --> 03:01.630
I should be hunting mammoths.

03:01.663 --> 03:03.838
Yeah, with your knee, fat
chance.

03:03.901 --> 03:06.718
Look, the music industry is
dead.

03:06.781 --> 03:08.383
Selling advertising isn't so
bad.

03:08.414 --> 03:10.782
I wasn't put on this
planet to do any job.

03:11.646 --> 03:13.054
I need to do something that
counts.

03:13.087 --> 03:16.254
Oh, please, please, do not
mention your premonitions.

03:16.285 --> 03:19.807
I am sorry, but becoming
Mystic Greg on Blackpool Pier

03:19.839 --> 03:21.823
is not gonna keep us in beer
and skittles.

03:21.854 --> 03:23.135
I do see things.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.055
The only thing you're
gonna see is a psychiatrist,

03:25.118 --> 03:27.071
and failing that, a divorce
lawyer.

03:28.574 --> 03:31.134
You're not a visionary or a
prophet, Greg.

03:31.775 --> 03:35.518
You're just an ex-raver
who nicked too many pills.

03:39.294 --> 03:40.734
I don't know why we came back
here.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.487
'Cause I didn't want her
smoking crack at kindergarten.

03:43.518 --> 03:45.949
And our Portobello bedsit
was a mansion that's why.

03:45.981 --> 03:47.647
There's nothing here
for us.

03:47.679 --> 03:48.574
I feel strange.

03:48.607 --> 03:49.694
Enough!

03:50.494 --> 03:51.871
Don't push it, okay?

03:51.902 --> 03:54.846
If this don't stop, we'll stop.

03:54.878 --> 03:57.183
You don't mean that, do you?

03:57.214 --> 03:58.686
I don't know. I just...

04:01.695 --> 04:02.591
What I do know

04:04.221 --> 04:07.198
is that you need a wake-up call.

04:08.061 --> 04:13.247
I love you, I really do, but
we can't go on like this.

04:25.183 --> 04:27.455
Oh, happy birthday, Greg.

04:29.085 --> 04:30.335
Well, almost.

05:00.222 --> 05:02.175
A bit fucking late, aren't
you?

05:02.207 --> 05:05.629
Just the right time
to collect your damned soul.

05:05.694 --> 05:06.942
Do me a favour...

05:06.975 --> 05:09.373
Oh, I'm afraid
you've run out of favours.

05:09.405 --> 05:10.847
You're not a bit old for this?

05:10.878 --> 05:12.542
Death has no age.

05:12.575 --> 05:14.974
I've been here since the
beginning.

05:15.007 --> 05:16.255
You understand me?

05:16.286 --> 05:17.727
You're really getting
into the role, aren't you?

05:17.758 --> 05:20.415
So, what's it gonna be?

05:21.375 --> 05:22.527
Well, say it at least.

05:22.558 --> 05:25.086
Oh, fuck, trick or
treat.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.198
Cross my palms with
silver

05:31.230 --> 05:33.951
or face eternal damnation, come
on.

05:35.389 --> 05:37.791
Sorry, mate, it's all I've
got.

05:37.822 --> 05:39.359
You remember,.

05:40.286 --> 05:44.382
Your road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

05:57.022 --> 05:58.333
Where you going?

05:58.365 --> 06:00.094
I said why, are we going out?

06:00.127 --> 06:02.238
She says, no, I'm going out and
I'm turning the heating off.

06:03.711 --> 06:06.847
Me and the wife, we've been
arguing about those holidays.

06:06.878 --> 06:08.286
I want to go to Tenerife.

06:08.958 --> 06:10.623
She wants to come with me.

06:12.126 --> 06:15.645
Six fellas beating up my
mother-in-law.

06:15.678 --> 06:18.238
The neighbour says to me,
"Aren't you gonna help?"

06:19.198 --> 06:21.278
I says, "No, six should be
enough."

06:26.718 --> 06:28.734
Christ on a bike.

06:28.767 --> 06:31.166
What a silly example of a man.

06:32.382 --> 06:33.918
Yeah, you.

06:33.950 --> 06:35.039
Look at you.

06:35.070 --> 06:37.118
You thankless twat, you're
pathetic.

06:37.151 --> 06:39.806
You're about as much
use as a one-legged man

06:39.839 --> 06:41.214
in an ass-kicking contest.

06:41.278 --> 06:44.510
About as much use as an
ejector seat on a helicopter

06:44.542 --> 06:45.982
or a handbrake on a canoe.

07:02.975 --> 07:04.734
Kid, kid!

07:04.766 --> 07:09.951
I need your help, kid.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.302
I need your help, kid.

07:14.942 --> 07:16.222
Dan.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.782
I've just killed
someone.

07:30.815 --> 07:31.806
What?

07:31.838 --> 07:33.855
I've just fucking killed
someone.

07:33.886 --> 07:34.782
Shh.

07:38.462 --> 07:40.319
What the fuck you talking about?

07:41.214 --> 07:43.647
I was driving along,
driving along, right?

07:48.799 --> 07:49.919
Had a few beers.

07:51.742 --> 07:53.247
A little bit fucking wired.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.559
I'm driving a bit too fast,

07:58.590 --> 08:00.606
and this fucking bloke...

08:03.038 --> 08:04.063
He just run out of nowhere

08:04.094 --> 08:06.335
and I just smashed right into
him.

08:08.062 --> 08:09.502
I seriously fucked up.

08:10.622 --> 08:11.999
Where did this happen?

08:12.030 --> 08:14.430
The little lake, you know,
by the side of the Red Line.

08:14.462 --> 08:15.390
Did anyone see?

08:16.574 --> 08:17.566
- No.
- Definitely?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.686
Definitely.

08:20.031 --> 08:22.078
You sure he's dead?

08:22.110 --> 08:23.294
Yeah.

08:23.326 --> 08:26.270
What, you just left him there?

08:28.319 --> 08:29.150
No.

08:29.182 --> 08:30.814
Where the fuck is he then?

08:30.847 --> 08:32.126
Outside in the boot.

08:46.622 --> 08:48.575
Why'd you put the body in the
boot?

08:48.606 --> 08:50.782
Look clearly, man, I got out,

08:52.222 --> 08:54.750
I go over to him, and
he's still breathing.

08:56.159 --> 08:57.598
So I pick him up and I put
him in the back of the car.

08:57.630 --> 08:58.783
I'm on my way to the hospital,

08:58.942 --> 09:02.046
I'm driving and I'm halfway
there to the hospital...

09:02.942 --> 09:06.398
And he just fucking dies there
and then.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.670
He stops breathing there and
fucking then.

09:08.702 --> 09:10.494
But you should have still
taken him to the hospital

09:10.526 --> 09:11.934
'cause they could have saved
him.

09:11.966 --> 09:12.862
Listen.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.166
He stopped breathing.

09:15.198 --> 09:16.798
He died, and I'm well over the
limit.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.174
Twice minimum.

09:20.542 --> 09:24.703
These days, you're looking
at 10 fucking years inside.

09:24.766 --> 09:26.591
Do you understand me?

09:26.623 --> 09:28.126
10 years inside!

09:30.238 --> 09:31.679
Fucking more with my shit.

09:36.062 --> 09:39.486
I don't see you for nine
months

09:41.086 --> 09:42.462
and then you come here.

09:43.614 --> 09:45.150
This is a windup, ain't it?

09:45.182 --> 09:48.446
It's a fucking birthday windup.

09:50.879 --> 09:52.286
There's no windup, kid.

09:55.359 --> 09:56.190
Keys.

10:33.150 --> 10:35.454
Just what exactly do you expect
me to do?

10:35.486 --> 10:38.110
Well, you got to help me.

10:38.142 --> 10:40.382
You and me, right?

10:40.415 --> 10:42.238
We're just gonna get rid of it.

10:42.270 --> 10:43.134
Now.

10:43.774 --> 10:44.926
In the sea, on the moors,
anywhere.

10:44.958 --> 10:46.750
We'll burn the car.

10:46.815 --> 10:49.918
We'll just tell the police it
were nicked.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.190
You've got to drive, kid,
'cause I'm well over the limit.

10:52.222 --> 10:55.006
No, no, no fucking way.

10:55.038 --> 10:57.118
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:57.150 --> 10:59.806
After what you fucking did to
me?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.246
Fuck, whoever that is, I'm
not here.

11:05.278 --> 11:06.174
Right?

11:08.606 --> 11:10.782
Please, kid, okay?

11:12.478 --> 11:13.374
Okay?

11:41.438 --> 11:42.847
Hi, Clarence.

11:42.879 --> 11:44.062
A bit late for a social visit.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.110
It ain't a social,
Greg.

11:57.279 --> 11:59.710
So London never worked out,
then?

12:01.055 --> 12:01.951
Yeah.

12:03.935 --> 12:04.831
It was great.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.486
Just time to move on.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.566
Yeah?

12:09.598 --> 12:10.558
Maybe move back.

12:13.535 --> 12:14.431
Aw.

12:15.678 --> 12:18.942
You got a little one.

12:18.974 --> 12:19.838
Abby.

12:20.670 --> 12:22.878
A little girl, four months old.

12:24.446 --> 12:26.622
When's the last time you
had a proper bit of kip?

12:26.654 --> 12:29.086
About four months ago.

12:29.118 --> 12:30.366
Poor cock.

12:33.022 --> 12:34.974
It's your birthday, is it?

12:35.006 --> 12:38.846
Yeah, born exactly 45
years, nine minutes ago.

12:40.638 --> 12:42.174
Hold on, you were
born midnight Halloween?

12:42.206 --> 12:44.319
Doesn't that make you
some sort of a witch?

12:44.351 --> 12:46.654
Yeah, something like
that.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.558
Very nice.

12:57.854 --> 12:59.901
Punching above your weight a
bit in here?

12:59.934 --> 13:02.399
Daisy never had a chance.

13:02.430 --> 13:03.678
How is Daisy?

13:03.710 --> 13:05.886
Like you give a shit about my
sister.

13:10.303 --> 13:12.030
So what's going on?

13:12.063 --> 13:16.190
Well, we're looking for your
brother.

13:17.951 --> 13:19.775
You haven't seen him, have you?

13:19.807 --> 13:21.438
Nah.

13:21.470 --> 13:22.430
Haven't seen him for months.

13:22.462 --> 13:24.510
We had a fallout when I first
moved back.

13:24.575 --> 13:28.287
That's weird 'cause his car's
outside.

13:35.199 --> 13:36.063
Okay.

13:36.959 --> 13:40.446
Okay, yeah, yeah, he popped
'round about an hour ago,

13:40.478 --> 13:43.166
just to say happy birthday,
mate.

13:45.021 --> 13:46.430
He was hammered.

13:46.462 --> 13:48.734
Properly hammered and he was
trying to drive to the Strand,

13:48.766 --> 13:51.902
and I said no, no way, you
know, not in that state.

13:51.934 --> 13:54.143
So I took the keys off him.

13:55.454 --> 13:57.854
Well, they're just over there.

13:57.886 --> 14:02.270
That's weird, 'cause the fuck
knows what's happened to them.

14:06.270 --> 14:08.446
He then got in a taxi.

14:08.478 --> 14:09.599
And that's it.

14:14.974 --> 14:16.574
So the rumours are true.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.143
You've turned into a boring
cunt.

14:26.111 --> 14:27.198
Huh?

14:33.374 --> 14:34.463
Come with me.

15:01.054 --> 15:01.950
Jesus.

15:04.990 --> 15:07.006
I didn't know there was a market
for the grunt mags anymore

15:07.071 --> 15:08.574
with Internet and all that.

15:13.919 --> 15:15.614
Maybe there's a certain...

15:15.646 --> 15:18.014
He saw one kick and was sort of
nostalgic.

15:18.045 --> 15:20.958
You know, like hipsters
getting back into vinyl.

15:32.190 --> 15:35.167
Fuck, lads, lads, I seriously.

15:35.199 --> 15:36.734
Shh.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.342
Let's just give your
brother a ring, shall we?

16:00.927 --> 16:02.334
Cock Womble.

16:03.165 --> 16:04.318
Dear, oh dear.

16:04.350 --> 16:05.887
We're gonna have to search your
gaff.

16:05.950 --> 16:07.230
I don't what Dan's been up to.

16:07.261 --> 16:09.981
There's the baby and my wife's
upstairs,

16:10.014 --> 16:11.391
and seriously, you don't want
to...

16:11.423 --> 16:13.054
I don't give a shit.

16:19.935 --> 16:23.263
Lesley, stay and watch him,
will you?

16:23.325 --> 16:24.927
And don't you worry.

16:24.959 --> 16:26.622
I'll be as quiet as a dormouse.

16:27.326 --> 16:30.654
Clarence, please, I cannot
let you go upstairs with that.

16:30.687 --> 16:31.870
Seriously.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.206
No, listen, you fucking,
you fucking touch them...

16:34.237 --> 16:36.094
And you what?

16:36.830 --> 16:39.231
Please, leave the weapon.

18:12.479 --> 18:14.781
Let me go to her, please.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.991
You are coming
with us.

18:41.022 --> 18:41.887
No!

18:41.918 --> 18:43.614
This ain't up for discussion,
mate.

18:43.645 --> 18:44.991
Boss wants to see you.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.334
What, you mean Damo?

18:46.398 --> 18:48.510
Damo, what, you really
are outta touch, ain't you?

18:48.541 --> 18:50.783
Jesus, no, that guy got shot
years ago.

18:50.814 --> 18:54.174
Now our new boss, mate,
she's something else.

18:54.205 --> 18:56.125
You may even like her.

20:57.215 --> 21:02.398
Welcome to my parlour,
said the spider to the fly.

21:07.390 --> 21:08.735
It stands here.

21:09.695 --> 21:10.590
Here.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.526
Hmm.

21:14.558 --> 21:17.246
You're a pretty one, aren't you?

21:17.279 --> 21:19.678
But obviously a bit old for me.

21:24.765 --> 21:25.855
That's better.

21:26.558 --> 21:28.991
I don't like the surly ones.

21:29.022 --> 21:32.254
Oh, the surly ones, they
bring out the worst in me.

21:33.118 --> 21:35.775
You're gonna have to tell
me something, Gregory,

21:35.807 --> 21:39.647
and no fibbing, mind, 'cause
I'll know,

21:39.678 --> 21:43.647
and then things will
become less agreeable.

21:43.678 --> 21:47.614
You need to tell me where
your brother Danny is.

21:47.647 --> 21:48.543
Listen...

21:49.151 --> 21:53.022
Don't fucking tell me to listen,
you little fucking prick!

21:54.303 --> 21:55.198
I'm sorry.

21:56.350 --> 21:57.599
Sorry.

21:57.630 --> 22:00.285
He came over to the house
a couple of hours ago

22:00.318 --> 22:01.375
just to wish me happy birthday

22:01.406 --> 22:03.742
and then he got in a cab to the
Strand

22:03.774 --> 22:06.910
and that's all I know.

22:06.943 --> 22:08.351
Do you know, Gregory,

22:09.150 --> 22:14.302
there's only one thing I
love more than Ronnie here,

22:15.006 --> 22:18.111
and that would be my son,
Baxter.

22:19.742 --> 22:22.686
And the last I heard from
Baxter,

22:22.718 --> 22:25.535
he was heading off to see your
Dan

22:25.566 --> 22:27.198
to talk about something heavy.

22:27.230 --> 22:28.734
His words, man.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.398
And he hasn't been seen since.

22:31.743 --> 22:34.014
And he's not answering his
calls,

22:34.046 --> 22:37.246
and now, nor is your brother.

22:39.262 --> 22:40.158
Listen.

22:41.565 --> 22:43.390
He left his phone at the house.

22:43.453 --> 22:46.751
I know where he left his
fucking phone!

22:52.222 --> 22:56.286
What he
said about Karen is true.

23:01.790 --> 23:05.086
Oh, Gregory, you were
about three seconds away

23:05.118 --> 23:07.327
from getting a blind dog for
Christmas.

23:10.078 --> 23:11.550
Look, Clarence here tells me

23:11.582 --> 23:14.270
that Dan's slut works over town.

23:14.334 --> 23:17.375
So maybe, just maybe,
your story stacks up.

23:17.406 --> 23:21.885
I would suggest you start
your inquiries with her.

23:23.550 --> 23:25.470
Now you listen.

23:27.550 --> 23:30.719
If my son or your brother

23:30.782 --> 23:35.038
are not standing where
you are by 2:00 a.m.,

23:37.982 --> 23:40.093
I'm gonna let you choose

23:41.438 --> 23:45.182
if your wife or your
little girl dies first.

23:54.686 --> 23:58.878
And son, don't try and do a
runner

24:00.382 --> 24:05.118
'cause I'll split you from here
to here.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.478
Understood?

24:42.558 --> 24:47.742
Trick or treat.

24:51.518 --> 24:53.279
What the fuck are you doing?

24:53.310 --> 24:54.974
Keep your eyes on the road.

24:57.215 --> 25:02.398
So Daisy tells me you were a
bit naughty back in the day.

25:02.654 --> 25:03.710
Oh, really?

25:04.734 --> 25:07.710
Found out soon enough I wasn't
built for that kind of caper.

25:07.742 --> 25:08.606
Yeah?

25:09.662 --> 25:11.454
- What happened?
- Nothing.

25:11.486 --> 25:13.822
Nah, nah, nah, come on, tell
me.

25:14.814 --> 25:15.711
Oi.

25:16.638 --> 25:19.294
Tell me.

25:21.119 --> 25:24.671
Well, one day about nine
years ago,

25:24.703 --> 25:26.175
Damo asked me to come along
with him

25:26.206 --> 25:27.198
to pick up some goodies.

25:27.231 --> 25:30.078
So we drive off, meet
some bloke in the woods

25:30.111 --> 25:33.726
to do a deal, but Damo,
he don't wanna do a deal.

25:33.758 --> 25:36.191
No, no, no, he's got
something else on his mind.

25:36.223 --> 25:37.310
Before anyone said a word,

25:37.342 --> 25:38.302
he's just got this screwdriver
out,

25:38.366 --> 25:40.798
it's like really working him.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.814
And I so wanted to stop Damo.

25:50.430 --> 25:52.574
But I didn't, and that poor
bastard,

25:52.606 --> 25:55.359
he just slipped away right in
front of me.

25:57.470 --> 25:59.742
I went to London two days after
that.

26:04.158 --> 26:06.974
So how's
fatherhood treating you?

26:07.006 --> 26:07.998
It's...

26:11.039 --> 26:12.608
It's great.

26:12.639 --> 26:13.822
I wouldn't change it for the
world.

26:16.350 --> 26:17.759
Yeah?

26:17.790 --> 26:18.686
Right.

26:19.742 --> 26:24.542
Don't you miss it, the
buzz, the girls, the fun?

26:26.366 --> 26:30.495
Oh, yeah, yeah.

26:31.230 --> 26:32.831
The sort of stuff I can handle.

26:32.863 --> 26:36.030
Yeah, you can't have
your coke and snort it.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.694
You must be bored though, no?

26:37.726 --> 26:39.551
Bored, I'm fucking bored
shitless.

26:40.766 --> 26:41.822
My life's a waking nightmare,

26:41.854 --> 26:44.542
it's just duties, obligations,
chores.

26:44.574 --> 26:46.398
My old man, before he got
himself killed,

26:46.430 --> 26:48.159
did fuck all for us kids.

26:48.191 --> 26:50.622
Didn't change a single nappie,
nothing.

26:50.655 --> 26:52.254
Went out, brought home the
bacon.

26:52.286 --> 26:53.374
Mom brought us up.

26:53.406 --> 26:55.262
Clear demarcation of roles,

26:55.294 --> 26:57.662
and now, I'm, I mean, it's
confused.

26:57.727 --> 27:01.406
So, what do you actually do
all day?

27:01.438 --> 27:05.758
I change nappies, I
sterilise bottles, night feeds.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.030
It's relentless, it's fucking
relentless.

27:08.062 --> 27:11.103
Man like you doing all
that stuff, it ain't right.

27:11.135 --> 27:12.830
A man like you

27:15.454 --> 27:17.310
should be out hunting mammoths.

27:19.775 --> 27:20.926
What did you just say?

27:25.694 --> 27:27.966
Turn right here, park over up
the right.

27:36.574 --> 27:38.015
Evening gentlemen, table for
two?

27:38.047 --> 27:39.230
Yeah, is Karen here?

27:39.262 --> 27:40.575
Yeah, but she's a bit
busy at the moment, so...

27:40.606 --> 27:41.246
Back room, right?

27:56.446 --> 27:57.502
How's it going, mate?

27:57.534 --> 27:59.135
Clarence, what are you doing
here?

27:59.167 --> 28:00.286
Yeah, Clarence, lad,

28:00.318 --> 28:02.015
I thought you only
liked your kippers warm.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.646
Ah, kippers.

28:03.678 --> 28:04.831
You still order kippers?

28:04.863 --> 28:05.758
Hold on a sec.

28:07.807 --> 28:08.958
You take the piss out of me

28:08.990 --> 28:12.446
I'll fuck you up, do you hear
me?

28:12.479 --> 28:13.374
On you go.

28:14.623 --> 28:17.630
Boys, boys, boys, how's it
going?

28:32.030 --> 28:34.302
What do you recommend?

28:34.334 --> 28:35.262
All of it, sir.

28:36.222 --> 28:37.214
Even the flowers?

28:39.359 --> 28:41.022
Maybe leave those for dessert.

28:43.134 --> 28:43.998
Listen.

28:45.183 --> 28:46.942
Karen, I'm not really here to
eat.

28:46.974 --> 28:49.630
I'm supposed to be finding
out where your boyfriend is.

28:49.662 --> 28:50.526
Who?

28:50.558 --> 28:51.486
Dan.

28:51.518 --> 28:52.446
Dan Kielty.

28:52.478 --> 28:54.654
Haven't seen him for weeks.

28:54.687 --> 28:55.710
Thought you guys
were supposed to be...

28:55.743 --> 28:56.863
No.

28:56.894 --> 28:58.238
Not anymore.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.150
Anyways, I was only ever
his bit on the side.

29:01.182 --> 29:02.078
Okay.

29:03.166 --> 29:05.279
Well, thanks.

29:05.982 --> 29:08.541
I hear he's still carrying
on with his brother's wife.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.278
What did you just say?

29:17.310 --> 29:20.350
He's having an affair
with his brother's wife.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.519
It's the worst kept secret in
Blackpool.

29:23.550 --> 29:24.798
Everyone knows.

29:24.830 --> 29:25.886
Everyone knows?

29:25.918 --> 29:26.878
Yeah.

29:26.910 --> 29:28.511
And I doubt the brother's gonna
be around

29:28.543 --> 29:29.982
for much longer either.

29:30.014 --> 29:31.359
Gonna be around?

29:31.423 --> 29:33.662
I hear they want him out of
the picture.

29:33.694 --> 29:34.590
And soon.

29:35.646 --> 29:38.301
Apparently, he's a right moody
bastard.

29:40.510 --> 29:43.070
Listen, there's four boys from
Blackburn

29:43.101 --> 29:44.478
turning up to eat soon.

29:45.535 --> 29:47.358
When they're done, I'm free.

29:47.390 --> 29:48.286
Free all night.

29:51.134 --> 29:52.030
Sorry.

29:53.503 --> 29:54.718
Married.

29:54.750 --> 29:57.119
Don't mean you can't
have your bit of fun.

29:57.790 --> 30:00.863
No, that's exactly what it
means.

30:03.039 --> 30:04.863
She was a stripper, man.

30:04.895 --> 30:06.141
Used to light the light bulbs
with...

30:06.174 --> 30:07.839
And he's not heard that mad
thing.

30:07.871 --> 30:09.759
They've actually invented a food

30:09.791 --> 30:11.390
that stops women giving blow
jobs.

30:11.423 --> 30:12.575
Are you serious?

30:12.958 --> 30:15.263
Seriously, it's called, no,
what is it?

30:15.295 --> 30:16.543
That's it, wedding cake.

30:16.574 --> 30:19.678
Psst.

30:19.710 --> 30:21.790
There's another way out in the
back.

30:32.061 --> 30:33.567
Thanks.

30:59.966 --> 31:02.685
You look like a man
with a lot on his mind.

31:02.718 --> 31:03.678
You have no idea.

31:03.710 --> 31:05.534
Trust me, I've heard it all.

31:06.974 --> 31:08.190
Not this you haven't.

31:08.223 --> 31:09.694
Sounds serious.

31:10.622 --> 31:13.310
I just heard my brother
is fucking my wife.

31:17.759 --> 31:21.310
Okay, well, that's serious.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.287
You know, my old man used to
say to me,

31:24.319 --> 31:26.846
he said there's three sides to
every tale,

31:26.878 --> 31:28.894
his, hers, and the truth.

31:28.926 --> 31:32.383
My advice, don't do anything
stupid

31:32.414 --> 31:34.686
until you know the truth, the
whole truth.

31:34.717 --> 31:36.927
Too many men in Strangeways
doing life

31:36.959 --> 31:38.301
because they did something
stupid

31:38.334 --> 31:40.477
when they didn't know the whole
truth.

31:47.901 --> 31:49.918
- Ta.
- Keep the change.

31:50.559 --> 31:51.614
Thanks.

31:55.007 --> 31:59.581
The fact that you're sitting
here right now talking to me,

32:00.541 --> 32:03.390
and the countless
million-to-one chance

32:03.421 --> 32:05.855
that it took to bring you into
existence

32:05.887 --> 32:09.471
in this desolate, lifeless
universe,

32:09.503 --> 32:14.303
I mean, the mathematical
impossibility of it.

32:14.334 --> 32:17.407
You don't know it, pal,
but just by being alive,

32:17.439 --> 32:19.485
you've already won the lottery.

32:19.518 --> 32:20.574
You're a winner.

32:22.526 --> 32:24.541
Life is a miracle.

32:25.438 --> 32:27.615
Don't throw it all away.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.821
Oh shit.

33:05.854 --> 33:09.054
Fuck, that was close, wasn't it?

33:09.087 --> 33:10.430
You all right?

33:11.134 --> 33:12.030
Kid?

33:13.983 --> 33:14.879
Kid?

33:26.878 --> 33:30.430
Do you remember when we were
about 12

33:30.463 --> 33:32.541
and you said you'd seen Dad on
the pier

33:32.574 --> 33:34.398
and that he was alive and
well and you chatted to him,

33:36.606 --> 33:38.783
and he'd said he'd missed us?

33:38.814 --> 33:40.478
Do you remember when I asked
you to look me in the eye

33:40.542 --> 33:43.294
and tell me again, and you
couldn't?

33:44.863 --> 33:46.110
You just ran away.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.343
You can't lie to me, kid.

33:50.685 --> 33:53.951
I can see right through you,
every time.

33:55.614 --> 33:59.199
So, I'm gonna ask you two
questions,

33:59.230 --> 34:00.445
and you're gonna look me right
in the eye

34:00.478 --> 34:02.110
and you're gonna tell me the
truth, okay?

34:02.143 --> 34:03.486
Look at me.

34:03.518 --> 34:04.414
Look at me.

34:05.181 --> 34:06.591
Okay, first question.

34:09.949 --> 34:11.358
Are you fucking my wife?

34:13.567 --> 34:14.399
You're joking, right?

34:14.429 --> 34:15.870
Answer the question.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.590
Greg, I'll look you
in the eye all night long

34:18.621 --> 34:19.967
and I'll give you the same
answer.

34:19.998 --> 34:21.214
Well, then tell me.

34:21.279 --> 34:22.143
Say it.

34:22.174 --> 34:24.670
I'm not fucking your wife.

34:26.687 --> 34:27.967
I swear on my life.

34:28.030 --> 34:30.333
Then why the fuck did
that human dinner plate

34:30.367 --> 34:32.190
just tell me that you were?

34:32.221 --> 34:32.830
What?

34:32.893 --> 34:33.949
Karen.

34:35.422 --> 34:36.318
Karen.

34:37.087 --> 34:40.158
Karen is the biggest shit
stirrer in Blackpool.

34:40.190 --> 34:41.150
Fuck that.

34:41.183 --> 34:42.237
In the county.

34:42.270 --> 34:44.541
I'm not exactly her
favourite person right now.

34:44.574 --> 34:45.951
She'd have clocked you
the minute you walked in,

34:45.983 --> 34:48.284
and there's no way that she's
gonna miss an opportunity

34:48.349 --> 34:51.293
to use you to fuck with me.

34:52.063 --> 34:53.534
Karen, kid.

34:56.221 --> 34:57.085
Come on.

35:00.478 --> 35:01.374
Okay.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.805
Okay.

35:03.838 --> 35:04.798
Geez.

35:05.055 --> 35:08.063
Second question, is the
poor cunt in the boot, Baxter.

35:11.550 --> 35:12.190
Yeah.

35:12.223 --> 35:13.309
Fuck!

35:15.007 --> 35:16.382
Why, Dan?

35:16.415 --> 35:17.310
Why?

35:18.078 --> 35:19.998
This goes no further.

35:20.029 --> 35:21.598
Not even to Gemma, right?

35:22.687 --> 35:25.055
Last year, I got nicked with
four Ks,

35:25.725 --> 35:29.758
and you know I can't do that
kind of time.

35:29.822 --> 35:32.670
And your Baxter, right,
he's heard something

35:32.735 --> 35:34.878
and he comes 'round today,

35:34.911 --> 35:37.119
and he starts throwing
accusations at me.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.351
So you killed him?

35:41.214 --> 35:42.974
I thought he was your mate.

35:46.941 --> 35:48.670
I didn't mean to.

35:54.751 --> 35:57.214
An accident, with a pipe.

35:57.247 --> 35:59.358
You're a fucking prick.

35:59.389 --> 36:00.414
You've killed us all.

36:00.445 --> 36:01.502
No, no, no, no, no, no, you
listen.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.165
Listen, I thought of a way out,
right.

36:03.198 --> 36:04.318
I've put the body back in the
boot.

36:04.351 --> 36:06.398
We dump it near the Anderson's
HQ.

36:06.431 --> 36:08.255
Ms. Ferguson assumes it
was them that killed him.

36:08.286 --> 36:10.463
Nothing to do with us, we keep
still, we'll be all right.

36:10.494 --> 36:11.550
I might be able to do that,

36:11.583 --> 36:12.861
but you, they'll come asking
for you

36:12.894 --> 36:14.749
and you can't lie for fucking
shit.

36:14.781 --> 36:16.669
I'm a better liar than you
think.

36:16.701 --> 36:17.918
A lot better.

36:18.782 --> 36:20.541
Who's the other glass for?

36:23.358 --> 36:24.542
Well, it's for you, innit?

36:24.575 --> 36:26.591
I knew you'd be back at some
point.

36:30.495 --> 36:32.958
So, what do you think?

36:34.558 --> 36:36.287
Well, I suppose if
this plan of yours doesn't work,

36:36.318 --> 36:39.071
I know we'll have to leave the
UK, right?

36:39.102 --> 36:40.734
Maybe, why, what are you
getting at?

36:40.765 --> 36:43.614
Then maybe we're gonna
head to Europe or something.

36:43.645 --> 36:45.118
You know, split up.

36:45.822 --> 36:50.173
Maybe you take Gemma and
the baby, meet up later.

36:50.205 --> 36:52.093
Something like that.

36:53.214 --> 36:55.391
What were you looking at when I
came in?

36:56.511 --> 36:57.407
Nothing.

36:59.231 --> 37:00.126
Honest.

37:02.302 --> 37:03.198
All right.

37:04.191 --> 37:06.525
I'm looking at bad porn.

37:08.062 --> 37:09.150
Embarrassing.

37:09.183 --> 37:10.782
With the little one upstairs.

37:13.887 --> 37:16.607
You still use your
birthday every time, right?

37:34.110 --> 37:35.167
The nasty bastard's outside.

37:35.198 --> 37:36.510
We've got to get you and your
car

37:36.542 --> 37:37.566
the fuck out of here right now.

37:37.598 --> 37:40.030
Listen to me, I'll take Gemma's
car.

37:40.063 --> 37:42.045
He'll follow me, then you take
your motor

37:42.078 --> 37:44.222
and wait for me at the
north end of Pear Lane.

37:44.255 --> 37:45.949
I'll stop next to the south end,

37:45.981 --> 37:48.862
wait until he parks up,
then run over to you, okay?

37:57.343 --> 37:59.615
- No fucking way.
- Take it.

38:00.831 --> 38:02.302
It's not a game.

38:14.206 --> 38:15.645
We can do this.

38:16.350 --> 38:17.598
I know I can.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.679
It's you I'm worried about.

38:21.438 --> 38:23.070
I'm not finished with you yet.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.750
Get in!

41:30.782 --> 41:33.054
Get the fuck out of here,
now, now, now!

41:44.670 --> 41:46.046
Better get off the road.

42:00.798 --> 42:03.678
Why, oh, why did you come
'round tonight?

42:03.711 --> 42:05.470
Just when I thought I'd
reached rock bottom,

42:05.502 --> 42:06.462
then you turn up.

42:06.495 --> 42:08.638
Yeah, well, it's when
you hit rock bottom

42:08.670 --> 42:11.295
that you make changes.

42:11.326 --> 42:12.190
Positive changes.

42:12.222 --> 42:14.142
What the fuck you talking
about?

42:15.870 --> 42:17.854
You know I'm always there for
you, kid.

42:19.582 --> 42:20.574
You know that, don't you?

42:20.639 --> 42:21.694
I thought you were,

42:21.726 --> 42:23.614
till that last little stunt you
pulled.

42:23.646 --> 42:24.542
Oh, listen.

42:24.702 --> 42:27.806
I've apologised for that
a thousand times, Greg.

42:29.023 --> 42:30.782
In a bad place back then.

42:30.814 --> 42:31.774
Yeah?

42:32.126 --> 42:35.039
Well, I'm in a pretty
fucking bad place right now.

42:35.518 --> 42:36.414
This life.

42:38.014 --> 42:39.326
You know you're not cut
out for it, don't you?

42:39.358 --> 42:41.726
Yeah, I know that, Greg,
and that's why I want out.

42:41.758 --> 42:43.838
- Badly.
- Then do it,

42:43.870 --> 42:46.303
because in this line of work,
you've gotta be ruthless.

42:46.334 --> 42:50.782
No conscience, no remorse,
no guilt, nothing.

42:50.814 --> 42:52.190
I'm sorry, Dan.

42:52.222 --> 42:54.718
You just don't fit the bill.

42:56.382 --> 42:58.366
You don't know how lucky you
are, mate.

42:58.398 --> 42:59.422
Hm?

43:00.575 --> 43:05.950
What I wouldn't give to live
your nice, cosy, simple life.

43:10.014 --> 43:12.318
What I wouldn't give to
have what you've got.

43:20.158 --> 43:22.462
Well, you might not believe
this,

43:22.494 --> 43:24.414
but while I'm scraping baby
shit from me fingernails,

43:24.446 --> 43:25.663
it's you I think about.

43:25.694 --> 43:26.846
Oh geeze.

43:28.158 --> 43:30.686
My next 20 years are mapped
out.

43:30.718 --> 43:33.470
I think about your life
and the good old days.

43:33.502 --> 43:37.342
No responsibilities, no
mortgage, no baby, no wife,

43:37.374 --> 43:39.103
no mundane routine.

43:39.134 --> 43:42.847
What you have is
spontaneity, freedom, fun.

43:42.911 --> 43:44.350
What a joy that'd be.

43:44.382 --> 43:45.054
Really?

43:45.086 --> 43:46.238
There's not a day goes by

43:46.270 --> 43:47.743
I don't think about getting on
a plane

43:47.774 --> 43:49.182
and heading off to Rio.

43:51.583 --> 43:54.622
Just me, my passport, and a wad
of cash.

43:55.902 --> 43:59.006
Grass is always
greener, right?

44:00.254 --> 44:02.334
Yeah, I guess it is.

44:02.975 --> 44:06.526
Thing is, mate, my life's
not all swimming with dolphins

44:06.558 --> 44:08.286
and orgies on superyachts.

44:09.150 --> 44:10.655
I stay all drunk and seedy

44:10.687 --> 44:13.246
bunked up in budget hotel in
Blackpool.

44:16.286 --> 44:17.790
Oh shit.

44:17.822 --> 44:20.191
What the fuck are we gonna do?

44:20.223 --> 44:21.119
Keep calm.

44:22.462 --> 44:23.870
The body's still in there,
right?

44:23.902 --> 44:25.406
Yes.

44:25.438 --> 44:26.174
Okay.

44:26.206 --> 44:27.742
Remember how this goes.

44:27.774 --> 44:29.246
He'll come to your side first.

44:29.278 --> 44:31.006
Easy does it, wind the window
down

44:31.038 --> 44:33.470
and calmly explain we're
heading home after a party.

44:33.502 --> 44:36.479
Tell him you gave up booze
three years ago, okay?

44:37.503 --> 44:39.614
Look him straight in the eye.

44:39.646 --> 44:44.734
Slow and stern, is there
a problem, officer?

44:44.766 --> 44:45.662
Repeat.

44:46.462 --> 44:47.806
Is there a problem, officer?

44:47.838 --> 44:48.510
Again.

44:48.574 --> 44:49.470
Is there a problem, officer?

44:49.502 --> 44:51.166
Okay, here he comes.

45:00.126 --> 45:01.758
Is there a roblem, ossifer?

45:01.790 --> 45:02.974
Pardon?

45:03.741 --> 45:06.494
Is there a problem, officer?

45:07.742 --> 45:09.534
Well, that depends, sir.

45:10.175 --> 45:12.734
Have you consumed any alcohol
tonight?

45:12.766 --> 45:13.662
No, sir.

45:15.230 --> 45:17.342
I haven't had a drink in three
years.

45:22.814 --> 45:23.711
Really?

45:24.350 --> 45:27.134
Well, maybe that's just
bullshit I can smell then.

45:28.190 --> 45:30.621
And may I ask what you
two gentlemen are up to

45:30.654 --> 45:32.030
at this late hour?

45:32.062 --> 45:36.510
We're just brothers, just
having a chat, officer.

45:40.959 --> 45:42.302
Licence, please.

45:53.886 --> 45:54.942
Keys, please.

45:58.686 --> 45:59.614
Stay there.

46:01.887 --> 46:03.678
Some fucking gangster you are.

46:08.831 --> 46:09.886
Roger that.

46:13.982 --> 46:16.511
So, Peregrine Morgan of
Wellington,

46:16.574 --> 46:17.598
before I breathalyse you,

46:17.630 --> 46:19.391
I just have one further
question.

46:20.063 --> 46:23.263
Is there anything in this
car that shouldn't be there?

46:23.326 --> 46:24.414
Don't think so.

46:24.446 --> 46:26.622
You don't think so.

46:26.654 --> 46:27.807
Definitely not.

46:28.927 --> 46:31.101
Please get out and open the
boot.

46:37.790 --> 46:39.102
You stay there.

46:56.894 --> 46:58.334
In your own time, sir.

47:10.654 --> 47:12.702
This side of Christmas would be
nice.

47:22.078 --> 47:23.679
Was that fucking gangster
enough for you, eh?

47:36.767 --> 47:37.727
I need to piss.

47:37.950 --> 47:40.830
No, we need to get
the fuck out of here now.

48:03.039 --> 48:04.318
Today's society
is blighted

48:04.350 --> 48:06.974
by an epidemic of depression,
and it is often men,

48:07.005 --> 48:08.478
especially those who have been
programmed

48:08.543 --> 48:12.094
not to speak about their
feelings, they struggle to cope.

48:12.126 --> 48:15.198
This repressed mental
anguish can become untenable

48:15.231 --> 48:16.479
as men approach middle age

48:16.510 --> 48:19.518
and they realise that their
dreams will never be fulfilled.

48:19.550 --> 48:23.135
Subsequently, suicide is now
the single biggest killer

48:23.167 --> 48:25.597
of males under the age of 45.

48:25.630 --> 48:28.607
At Wake Up Call, we
provide a range of services

48:28.638 --> 48:31.038
designed to read into
the client's mindset.

48:31.070 --> 48:33.950
For example, we stage-manage
extreme scenarios

48:33.981 --> 48:36.157
incorporating acquaintances of
the client

48:36.190 --> 48:39.678
designed to sabotage destructive
patterns of behaviour.

48:51.774 --> 48:52.830
You all right?

48:54.270 --> 48:55.134
Yeah.

48:58.174 --> 49:01.534
Has Gemma told you I've not
been feeling right recently?

49:01.567 --> 49:02.814
No, I haven't spoken to her
since...

49:02.846 --> 49:04.734
I know she's worried about me.

49:04.766 --> 49:06.781
Thinks I'm having some sort of
breakdown.

49:06.814 --> 49:09.501
Talking about couple's
counselling, NLP,

49:09.566 --> 49:11.454
all that kind of bollocks.

49:12.318 --> 49:14.910
Of course, I'd never go
down that road willingly.

49:18.110 --> 49:18.943
I don't get it.

49:18.974 --> 49:20.030
I think you do.

49:20.061 --> 49:22.045
No, Greg, I really don't.

49:22.110 --> 49:23.487
Just when I'm getting fucked
off

49:23.519 --> 49:24.607
with this dull life of mine

49:24.639 --> 49:26.175
and harking back to the good
old days,

49:26.207 --> 49:28.926
I'm suddenly shown in an
oh so fucking clear way

49:28.957 --> 49:32.094
that the good old days really
aren't that good after all.

49:33.279 --> 49:34.174
You've lost me, mate.

49:34.207 --> 49:36.094
Don't treat me like a fool.

49:36.127 --> 49:38.558
Clarence, he played it about
right.

49:38.591 --> 49:41.374
Might not get an Oscar, maybe a
BAFTA.

49:41.438 --> 49:42.943
And Ms. Ferguson, Jesus Christ.

49:42.974 --> 49:45.727
Any hammier, I'd have
brought out the Dijon.

49:45.759 --> 49:48.703
You think it's a wind-up?

49:48.734 --> 49:50.590
Give me the keys, time
to get back to Strand.

49:50.623 --> 49:52.254
It must be getting really
stuffy in there.

49:52.287 --> 49:53.598
Are you mad?

49:53.630 --> 49:55.230
His head's a bloody mess.

49:56.541 --> 49:58.686
All right, if you want, I'll
show you.

50:01.501 --> 50:02.655
Now this fellow's okay.

50:02.718 --> 50:05.471
He's no De Niro, six or
seven out of 10, tops.

50:05.535 --> 50:08.061
Let's face it, he's got
a fuck-all dialogue.

50:09.790 --> 50:10.941
I was just telling Dan here

50:10.974 --> 50:12.318
you probably shouldn't
give up the day job.

50:12.351 --> 50:15.263
Tom Cruise isn't exactly
quaking in his little boots.

50:16.127 --> 50:17.758
Oh, fucking hell!

50:25.054 --> 50:27.421
Lesley, you don't seriously
think that I had something

50:27.454 --> 50:29.727
to do with Baxter's
disappearance, do you?

50:35.423 --> 50:37.918
I don't get paid to think.

50:38.878 --> 50:40.191
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean you can't think

50:40.223 --> 50:42.750
for yourself on your own
time, sort of thing, does it?

50:42.781 --> 50:45.501
How can you possibly do that?

50:45.534 --> 50:48.063
That would be the intellectual
equivalent of moonlighting,

50:48.094 --> 50:49.438
and as long as I'm on company
time,

50:49.470 --> 50:51.039
I'll do what's required of me.

50:51.103 --> 50:52.511
That's a bit limiting, isn't
it?

50:52.542 --> 50:55.005
Look, every gang needs its
silent, nasty-looking bastard,

50:55.038 --> 50:56.478
and when I joined Ms.
Ferguson's outfit,

50:56.511 --> 51:00.829
that was only vacancy available,
so you make do, don't you?

51:00.861 --> 51:02.015
You basically saying we
should all

51:02.047 --> 51:04.127
just accept our allocated role?

51:05.439 --> 51:07.071
Not for society as a whole.

51:07.103 --> 51:09.822
That would be akin to living
in a quasi-feudal system.

51:09.855 --> 51:12.030
However, the corporate wheels
run smoother

51:12.063 --> 51:14.014
if employees simply accept
their lot.

51:14.047 --> 51:15.390
The stoics of ancient Greece

51:15.422 --> 51:17.471
such as Seneca and Marcus
Aurelius...

51:17.502 --> 51:19.551
You mean that fellow in
Gladiator?

51:21.790 --> 51:23.774
Those fellows argued very
cogently

51:23.805 --> 51:25.630
that to break the natural order
of things

51:25.663 --> 51:27.102
simply results in chaos,

51:27.135 --> 51:29.151
and that's the last
thing Ms. Ferguson needs.

51:29.183 --> 51:32.254
Well, if she did engage that
impressive brain of yours,

51:32.287 --> 51:33.726
you would realise that Dan here

51:33.758 --> 51:35.903
wouldn't dream of harming
Baxter.

51:37.119 --> 51:38.269
Well, that just may be,

51:38.301 --> 51:40.189
but seeing how this
conversation on gambit

51:40.221 --> 51:43.101
is a rather clumsy attempt
to persuade me to let you go,

51:43.134 --> 51:47.198
your innocence or otherwise
means nothing.

51:47.231 --> 51:50.654
Releasing you is illogical,
so we'll cease discussing it.

51:52.414 --> 51:53.982
- Okay.
- Fair enough.

51:54.718 --> 51:58.398
And you, dafty, no funny
business.

51:58.461 --> 52:00.990
I have my finger on the
trigger of a loaded revolver

52:01.023 --> 52:02.847
pointing at the base of your
spine.

52:03.934 --> 52:05.406
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep
stumm

52:05.438 --> 52:07.903
about our conversation when
we reach our destination.

52:07.934 --> 52:10.238
I'm the silent nasty one,
remember?

52:17.918 --> 52:20.414
Baxter ran away from
home once, you know.

52:20.445 --> 52:21.565
Just 12 years old.

52:21.599 --> 52:23.293
I've never been so scared in
all my life.

52:23.325 --> 52:25.822
Two days past, he still hadn't
come back.

52:25.854 --> 52:26.943
I was in pieces.

52:26.974 --> 52:29.023
No more balls back then, man.

52:29.053 --> 52:31.839
I thought the little
bugger had been kidnapped.

52:31.870 --> 52:33.981
Later, on the second day,

52:34.014 --> 52:36.829
he comes strolling into the
house.

52:36.861 --> 52:39.774
Get this.

52:39.805 --> 52:41.759
He said he'd been to look at
the sea.

52:41.791 --> 52:44.958
But not just here,
mind, on the east coast.

52:44.991 --> 52:46.847
He wanted to see if it looked
the same.

52:46.878 --> 52:49.119
He'd been to Grimsby and
back, fucking Grimsby.

52:52.830 --> 52:54.109
12 years old.

52:55.965 --> 52:59.295
There's something special of
that boy.

53:01.118 --> 53:02.430
Always has been.

53:06.621 --> 53:08.062
You little prick!

53:08.094 --> 53:10.911
Running away was a real
big fucking mistake.

53:10.942 --> 53:12.702
That's the spirit, Clarence.

53:12.767 --> 53:14.495
You'll get best supporting
actor for this, right?

53:14.526 --> 53:18.175
Oh dear, you are really
gonna get your fucking...

53:18.206 --> 53:21.630
Gently does it, Clarence.

53:21.694 --> 53:23.550
Plenty of time for that.

54:08.062 --> 54:09.630
Have you boys seen "Scarface?"

54:10.654 --> 54:13.215
It's gotta be one of me
favourites.

54:13.246 --> 54:14.879
It's a classic.

54:15.709 --> 54:18.046
A fucking classic!

54:18.078 --> 54:21.118
You know the scene where Al
Pacino was forced to watch

54:21.150 --> 54:23.967
his buddy getting chopped
in half with a chainsaw?

54:28.927 --> 54:30.878
Oh, I love it.

54:30.910 --> 54:32.638
Well, bearing that in mind,

54:32.670 --> 54:37.790
I think we now all fully
understand our roles, hm?

54:38.685 --> 54:43.038
So, let's begin.

54:43.902 --> 54:48.318
Look, this joke's gone on
long enough.

54:48.350 --> 54:50.143
Frankly, I thought his poke in
the eye

54:50.173 --> 54:51.615
was a little excessive.

54:51.646 --> 54:52.927
Don't get me wrong,

54:52.958 --> 54:56.767
I'm really impressed with your
commitment to this project.

54:56.798 --> 54:59.614
But, enough's enough, okay?

54:59.647 --> 55:02.975
This one I like, he's got big
cojones.

55:03.038 --> 55:05.247
Yeah, not for long he don't.

55:11.550 --> 55:13.758
Not for long he don't.

55:18.782 --> 55:19.678
Oh, oh!

55:21.950 --> 55:25.630
Now, Danny boy, this
is a one-question quiz.

55:25.663 --> 55:27.998
Any hesitation, repetition, or
deviation

55:28.030 --> 55:32.222
will result in your brother
getting mutilated, understood?

55:32.254 --> 55:34.494
Where's my son?

55:35.326 --> 55:36.223
Ms. Ferguson, please,

55:36.253 --> 55:39.070
I swear I have no fucking idea.

55:39.103 --> 55:41.631
I haven't seen him since this
morning.

55:41.662 --> 55:43.070
Really?

55:43.102 --> 55:47.295
And what was this heavy thing
he had to chat to you about?

55:47.326 --> 55:48.894
Well, I'd rather not say it
out loud.

55:48.926 --> 55:50.527
Come on, tell
me.

55:50.558 --> 55:52.734
You can share it with the class.

55:52.766 --> 55:54.015
I can't really.

55:57.310 --> 55:58.846
Fucking say it!

56:03.646 --> 56:08.478
He came 'round to say he
thought Clarence was a snitch.

56:08.511 --> 56:10.302
What the fuck?

56:10.335 --> 56:12.222
Don't listen to this little
cocksucker.

56:12.255 --> 56:14.015
Silence, Clarence.

56:15.518 --> 56:17.118
I've got his number.

56:19.806 --> 56:24.990
So, you don't know where Baxter
is?

56:36.670 --> 56:40.030
Honestly, I haven't got a
clue.

56:40.830 --> 56:42.558
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

56:42.622 --> 56:47.390
Rule number one, never say
honestly when you're lying.

56:47.454 --> 56:49.022
It's a dead giveaway.

56:49.054 --> 56:54.430
But I'm gonna give you, or
rather your brother here,

56:54.462 --> 56:55.199
one more chance.

56:55.230 --> 56:57.886
I have no fucking idea.

56:57.918 --> 56:59.358
The thing is, Daniel,

56:59.391 --> 57:03.902
why would I believe a
treacherous little shit like you?

57:05.503 --> 57:08.798
I know all about you and his
wife.

57:11.966 --> 57:14.751
Keep it in the family, eh, Dan?

57:21.950 --> 57:24.222
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

57:25.950 --> 57:30.846
Catch a liar by his toe.

57:34.174 --> 57:35.294
Listen.

57:35.326 --> 57:36.670
Tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk, tsk.

57:36.702 --> 57:37.822
This is a con.

57:38.846 --> 57:40.254
I know what's going on.

57:47.743 --> 57:51.326
Does this look like a con,
Gregory?

57:51.390 --> 57:54.590
Or maybe you'd like another
cut, eh?

57:54.622 --> 57:56.926
What the fuck is going on?

57:56.991 --> 58:00.670
I've seen the website he was
looking up, Wake Up Call.

58:00.702 --> 58:02.079
This is a scam.

58:02.111 --> 58:03.359
I know what's going on.

58:03.390 --> 58:05.951
Greg, no, that isn't for you.

58:05.983 --> 58:07.230
That's for me.

58:08.126 --> 58:09.854
I've been looking into every
way there is

58:09.886 --> 58:11.902
to help me get out of
this fucking hole that I...

58:11.934 --> 58:13.150
Shut the fuck up!

58:19.774 --> 58:23.519
Oh, poor me, tsk, tsk, tsk,
poor me.

58:23.550 --> 58:25.918
Pour me a fucking drink,
Reynaldo.

58:29.246 --> 58:31.998
Well, I'm afraid, Gregory,

58:32.702 --> 58:37.438
that things are gonna get a
little bit more serious now.

58:48.062 --> 58:51.710
Once more, and this time with
feeling,

58:51.742 --> 58:55.102
where the fuck is my Baxter?

58:55.134 --> 58:58.590
I promise you, Ms.
Ferguson, I don't know.

58:58.622 --> 59:00.542
You sure about that,
Dan?

59:04.479 --> 59:05.598
Of course, I am.

59:06.431 --> 59:07.486
What do you think, I'm just
gonna let...

59:07.646 --> 59:10.078
You absolutely sure
you don't know anything?

59:11.742 --> 59:15.742
I'm sure I don't know
anything, Greg.

59:15.774 --> 59:16.670
Really?

59:18.078 --> 59:19.550
'Cause I've got a feeling,

59:20.254 --> 59:23.934
a little feeling, that
you might know something.

59:25.278 --> 59:28.543
You might be able to lie to
her, but you can't lie to me.

59:29.471 --> 59:32.958
Ever since we were little, I
can tell.

59:35.231 --> 59:37.278
All I got to do is look you in
the eyes.

59:37.950 --> 59:41.470
I'm gonna give you one more
chance to do the right thing.

59:46.462 --> 59:47.326
Come on.

59:48.190 --> 59:51.902
Look me in the eye and tell me
the truth.

59:55.263 --> 59:56.478
Look at me, brother.

01:00:13.886 --> 01:00:17.022
What are you gonna do with
that, Gregory, light a fag?

01:00:17.054 --> 01:00:18.622
Cut him free, now.

01:00:18.654 --> 01:00:20.191
Do you honestly think that's
real?

01:00:20.255 --> 01:00:21.406
How about we find out?

01:00:21.438 --> 01:00:23.135
No, do it.

01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:25.119
Ms. Ferguson, it's real.

01:00:25.151 --> 01:00:26.366
I sold it to him.

01:00:27.742 --> 01:00:28.927
So what?

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.206
Do you think this is the first
time

01:00:30.238 --> 01:00:31.903
I've had a gun pointed at me?

01:00:31.934 --> 01:00:34.783
No, but it might just be your
last.

01:00:34.814 --> 01:00:35.902
Cut him free.

01:00:54.206 --> 01:00:56.286
Nice one, kid.

01:00:57.534 --> 01:00:59.326
Go and get his piece off him.

01:00:59.358 --> 01:01:00.639
Over there, please.

01:01:00.671 --> 01:01:01.567
Move.

01:01:05.247 --> 01:01:06.558
And your car keys.

01:01:11.007 --> 01:01:12.350
On your feet, Reynaldo.

01:01:13.406 --> 01:01:17.214
Everyone over there now.

01:01:17.246 --> 01:01:18.141
Now!

01:01:23.774 --> 01:01:24.607
That's better.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:26.270
That's much better.

01:01:31.902 --> 01:01:32.798
Hurry up!

01:01:33.501 --> 01:01:35.806
Come on, in here.

01:01:37.023 --> 01:01:38.111
Wait!

01:01:38.143 --> 01:01:39.646
Give us your mobiles, come on.

01:01:39.678 --> 01:01:41.310
You as well, Ms. Ferguson.

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:02.718
This isn't gonna end well.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.414
You do know that, don't you?

01:02:09.054 --> 01:02:11.519
You look like
you've seen a ghost, kid.

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:13.086
It's nothing, forget
it.

01:02:13.117 --> 01:02:14.781
What the fuck are we gonna do
now?

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:16.255
I don't know, kid.

01:02:19.581 --> 01:02:20.670
Hang on a minute.

01:02:20.702 --> 01:02:22.558
She knew about you and Gemma.

01:02:23.903 --> 01:02:25.662
I thought it was just
Karen's shit stirring.

01:02:25.694 --> 01:02:26.751
It is.

01:02:26.783 --> 01:02:28.190
Karen would have told
Clarence at the restaurant

01:02:28.221 --> 01:02:30.591
and he would have
reported back, that's all.

01:02:33.406 --> 01:02:35.326
They fucking know where I
live.

01:02:35.358 --> 01:02:37.022
They don't seem the forgiving
type.

01:02:37.054 --> 01:02:38.685
It's not gonna take them
long before they find out

01:02:38.718 --> 01:02:40.415
about you-know-fucking-who
either.

01:02:40.447 --> 01:02:41.471
Fuck me!

01:02:41.503 --> 01:02:42.910
This makes your fucking last
stunt

01:02:42.942 --> 01:02:44.351
look like a freaking birthday
present!

01:02:44.414 --> 01:02:46.365
Oh man, stop harping
on about that, will you.

01:02:46.398 --> 01:02:47.710
Harping on about it?

01:02:47.742 --> 01:02:50.238
I nearly got my fucking head
kicked in 'cause of you,

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:52.094
you fucking prick!

01:02:52.158 --> 01:02:54.206
Always fucking trying to be the
big man.

01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:56.639
Trying to be like Dad, trying
to be me.

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:57.981
Trying to be you?

01:02:58.014 --> 01:02:59.743
A depressed, pussy-whipped
loser?

01:02:59.774 --> 01:03:01.982
Are you fucking joking?

01:03:02.014 --> 01:03:04.894
Your life is so fucking
awful, the only surprise is

01:03:04.926 --> 01:03:07.870
that you haven't topped
yourself already, hey!

01:03:07.902 --> 01:03:09.983
Fucking turn your back, you
prick!

01:03:14.047 --> 01:03:15.134
Sorry.

01:03:16.063 --> 01:03:18.559
Shit, I'm really sorry, kid.

01:03:18.591 --> 01:03:21.086
Kid, fucking hell, sorry.

01:03:23.615 --> 01:03:24.510
It's fine.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.487
You know, we're gonna have
to get out of this town.

01:03:27.519 --> 01:03:31.071
I'm talking America, Asia.

01:03:31.103 --> 01:03:32.830
Any fucking where but here.

01:03:33.983 --> 01:03:34.686
You're right.

01:03:34.717 --> 01:03:36.606
We're gonna have to split up.

01:03:37.759 --> 01:03:39.582
I'll go home, and I'll get me
passport,

01:03:39.614 --> 01:03:41.150
and I'll meet you at Manchester
Airport.

01:03:41.181 --> 01:03:42.334
It's the only way.

01:03:43.614 --> 01:03:44.670
Let's go.

01:03:55.774 --> 01:03:57.374
Were you gonna grass me out
back there?

01:03:57.405 --> 01:03:59.742
Nah, kid, just stalling for
time.

01:03:59.775 --> 01:04:05.118
You should have more faith,
brother.

01:04:06.815 --> 01:04:08.863
You're not driving, not with
your arm.

01:04:08.894 --> 01:04:09.950
And I'll take the car and drop
you off.

01:04:09.981 --> 01:04:11.583
You get a cab to go to yours,
okay?

01:04:11.615 --> 01:04:12.670
Okay.

01:04:12.703 --> 01:04:13.981
What are you gonna do with the
body?

01:04:14.014 --> 01:04:16.543
Don't worry about that.
I'll work something out.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.118
Sorry about all this.

01:04:41.151 --> 01:04:42.975
I ain't finished with you
yet, Dan.

01:04:43.007 --> 01:04:44.414
I know.

01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:45.918
So I'll see you at Manchester
Airport.

01:04:45.951 --> 01:04:47.646
Keep your mobile on.

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:52.638
You still get them visions, kid?

01:04:54.495 --> 01:04:58.398
Then tell me this, brother,
how's this all gonna end?

01:05:01.311 --> 01:05:02.207
I love you.

01:05:03.678 --> 01:05:05.661
Me too, kid.

01:05:50.334 --> 01:05:54.303
So, what's
it gonna be?

01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:57.983
Trick or treat?

01:06:26.879 --> 01:06:28.638
All right, Gregory.

01:06:28.671 --> 01:06:29.567
Gregory.

01:06:31.518 --> 01:06:32.767
Oi, dickhead.

01:06:38.718 --> 01:06:40.574
I don't
like the surly ones.

01:06:40.605 --> 01:06:42.558
They bring out the worst in me.

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:46.655
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:52.767
Get away, Clarence, you
fucking know this is real.

01:06:52.798 --> 01:06:55.101
Well, so is mine.

01:06:55.134 --> 01:06:57.981
But it's a lot fucking bigger.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.798
Now, now,
Clarence, no need for that.

01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:03.774
Get the fuck out of
here and no one gets hurt.

01:07:03.805 --> 01:07:06.047
Stop, or I'll shoot.

01:07:06.078 --> 01:07:07.902
You're not gonna hurt
me, are you, Gregory?

01:07:07.935 --> 01:07:10.878
I'm serious, fucking
stop right there, now!

01:07:31.967 --> 01:07:35.485
Jesus, Greg, did you really
think that someone like me

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:38.365
would be interested in someone
like you?

01:07:38.398 --> 01:07:43.487
10, 15 years ago maybe, but
you're old enough to be me dad.

01:07:48.861 --> 01:07:51.327
Oops, look who's here.

01:07:53.087 --> 01:07:56.766
Gemma, what you doing
here?

01:07:57.791 --> 01:08:01.341
Trick or
treat, kid.

01:08:06.335 --> 01:08:06.974
Dan.

01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:13.055
I got you.

01:08:14.078 --> 01:08:16.479
Maybe now you'll
appreciate what we have.

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:18.078
What you gave up wasn't fun.

01:08:18.911 --> 01:08:19.805
It was horrible.

01:08:19.837 --> 01:08:21.533
And because you never listened
to me,

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.807
you had to find out the hard
way.

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:25.854
Do you really believe
you're the first bloke

01:08:25.886 --> 01:08:27.198
to feel like this?

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:28.671
Or woman for that matter?

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:32.191
Adjusting to this stage in life
is tough.

01:08:33.694 --> 01:08:35.358
But it's time to grow up, babes.

01:08:36.447 --> 01:08:40.638
Oh, mate, I'm so, so, sorry
if our methods seem extreme,

01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:43.134
but extreme times call
for extreme measures,

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:46.014
and your mental state
is becoming untenable.

01:08:46.046 --> 01:08:48.957
You needed to see the past
for what it was, reject it,

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:50.366
and embrace the future.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.415
Love and routine are far more
preferable

01:08:52.446 --> 01:08:55.295
to chaos and insecurity, are
they not?

01:08:57.567 --> 01:09:02.238
This truly is the first day
of the rest of your life.

01:09:57.662 --> 01:09:58.526
Fuck.

01:10:01.822 --> 01:10:03.711
Kid, what's happening?

01:10:05.023 --> 01:10:06.078
I fucking killed him.

01:10:06.175 --> 01:10:09.278
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what
the fuck?

01:10:09.885 --> 01:10:11.262
- Who?
- Baxter.

01:10:12.543 --> 01:10:14.334
He wasn't dead, he opened the
boot.

01:10:15.231 --> 01:10:17.407
And now he's fucking dead.

01:10:17.438 --> 01:10:18.558
What'd you do, shoot him?

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:19.998
I killed him.

01:10:20.031 --> 01:10:21.951
I fucking killed him.

01:10:21.982 --> 01:10:24.671
What, wait a minute, with
the gun I gave you, right?

01:10:24.702 --> 01:10:27.967
It was an accident,
it all happened so fast.

01:10:34.302 --> 01:10:36.191
What have you done with
the body?

01:10:36.222 --> 01:10:38.206
I put him back in the
boot.

01:10:39.262 --> 01:10:41.407
Listen, we stick to the plan.

01:10:41.438 --> 01:10:42.942
I've got my passport
and I'm near your gaff.

01:10:42.975 --> 01:10:44.478
So I'm gonna collect Gemma and
Abby

01:10:44.542 --> 01:10:47.902
and we're gonna meet you at
Manchester Airport, okay?

01:10:48.735 --> 01:10:50.526
Okay.

01:10:50.558 --> 01:10:51.198
Okay.

01:10:55.326 --> 01:10:56.415
Fuck.

01:10:58.079 --> 01:11:01.055
I know
all about you and his wife.

01:11:01.086 --> 01:11:02.975
Keep it in the family, eh, Dan?

01:11:03.006 --> 01:11:05.726
I'm not fucking your
wife.

01:11:05.759 --> 01:11:07.167
I swear to my life.

01:11:08.413 --> 01:11:10.303
I'm a better liar than you
think.

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:11.615
A lot better.

01:11:13.662 --> 01:11:19.039
What I wouldn't give to live
your nice, cosy, simple life.

01:11:21.054 --> 01:11:25.055
What I wouldn't give to
have what you've got.

01:11:26.653 --> 01:11:28.287
Sorry sir, kitchen's closed.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:29.310
I'm not here for food.

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:39.807
I need you to tell me what's
going on.

01:11:39.838 --> 01:11:40.990
What's going on?

01:11:41.023 --> 01:11:43.006
Yeah, what the fuck is going
on.

01:11:43.678 --> 01:11:44.863
Please tell me.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:45.758
Four pricks from
Bellamy just ate raw fish

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:47.006
off me naked body.

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:49.663
Nothing unusual to report.

01:11:49.693 --> 01:11:51.454
I thought they were from
Blackburn.

01:11:51.487 --> 01:11:52.573
Whatever.

01:11:53.503 --> 01:11:56.510
That thing you said
about Dan, is it true?

01:11:56.542 --> 01:11:57.438
What thing?

01:11:57.758 --> 01:12:00.542
Is my brother having
an affair with my wife?

01:12:01.214 --> 01:12:02.302
Oh my God.

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:04.734
You're the moody brother?

01:12:06.046 --> 01:12:08.511
Shit, you really are, aren't
you?

01:12:10.335 --> 01:12:14.782
Look, I don't want to be the
bearer of bad news, but yes,

01:12:17.055 --> 01:12:20.446
that little wanker's been
fucking your wife for months.

01:12:21.214 --> 01:12:22.110
Maybe years.

01:12:23.263 --> 01:12:24.670
You're just shit-stirring.

01:12:24.702 --> 01:12:27.711
I didn't know who the hell
you were until 10 seconds ago.

01:12:27.742 --> 01:12:28.638
Really?

01:12:31.807 --> 01:12:35.550
Listen, Dan told me a story.

01:12:35.614 --> 01:12:37.118
Happened about nine months ago,

01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:39.070
just before me and him got
together.

01:12:39.102 --> 01:12:41.918
I think that's what
stopped you two talking.

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:44.446
He said he promised his
brother, I guess that's you,

01:12:44.478 --> 01:12:46.078
that he'd act as backup in some
dispute

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.575
you'd had with the builder,
only Dan never turned up,

01:12:48.606 --> 01:12:51.838
and you got the crap kicked out
of ya.

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:53.470
Little prick.

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.398
Right.

01:12:56.159 --> 01:12:57.694
The reason he didn't turn up

01:12:58.462 --> 01:13:01.694
is 'cause he was with your
missus at the Imperial

01:13:01.726 --> 01:13:04.095
having a whale of a time,
apparently.

01:13:05.022 --> 01:13:07.710
And you know, the way he told
that story,

01:13:07.742 --> 01:13:09.182
it's like it were a joke.

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:12.862
Like he were proud of
that scumbag behaviour.

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:17.694
I don't think you should go
anywhere.

01:13:20.415 --> 01:13:22.431
There's nothing for you back
home,

01:13:22.462 --> 01:13:27.839
and anyway, what you need now
is some TLC.

01:13:32.319 --> 01:13:34.942
I bet you haven't had any in
years.

01:13:36.638 --> 01:13:37.502
Years.

01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:40.319
Life is short.

01:13:41.535 --> 01:13:44.958
Why waste your time in a dull
marriage

01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:47.486
when there's so much fun to be
had.

01:13:49.246 --> 01:13:52.766
Don't tell me you're
just another lost man,

01:13:53.566 --> 01:13:57.247
whaling around trying to
work out what his role is.

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:23.934
I love you.

01:14:37.502 --> 01:14:38.559
Gemma, I think Greg
knows.

01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:41.471
We need to leave ASAP, be there
in five.

01:14:41.503 --> 01:14:42.590
Love you.

01:15:05.662 --> 01:15:06.942
Guess what?

01:15:39.967 --> 01:15:41.214
Quick, come.

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:42.270
Don't worry about that.

01:15:42.334 --> 01:15:45.150
Just get the basics, get a few
nappies.

01:15:45.182 --> 01:15:47.358
Get a couple of Babygros.

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:49.278
We're travelling light.

01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:51.070
Oi.

01:15:51.102 --> 01:15:52.734
Are you all right?

01:15:52.766 --> 01:15:54.463
It isn't easy, you
know.

01:15:54.494 --> 01:15:55.710
Greg and I...

01:15:57.438 --> 01:15:59.038
There was a time when
it was all ahead of us,

01:15:59.071 --> 01:16:02.015
when it was so much fun.

01:16:02.047 --> 01:16:03.871
There was a time I wouldn't
have dreamed of doing anything

01:16:03.903 --> 01:16:05.150
like we're doing now.

01:16:07.966 --> 01:16:09.759
You're too strong for
him.

01:16:10.494 --> 01:16:12.382
He doesn't give you
what you need, you know.

01:16:14.559 --> 01:16:16.158
I didn't change, he
did.

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:19.327
I could almost see him
shrinking in front of me.

01:16:19.359 --> 01:16:22.334
That dynamic, strong, confident
man,

01:16:22.366 --> 01:16:25.822
the man I fell in love
with, what happened to him?

01:16:25.854 --> 01:16:27.806
Life, that's what.

01:16:28.927 --> 01:16:32.318
Some people can take it and
some can't.

01:16:34.398 --> 01:16:36.222
Look what you got instead.

01:16:36.254 --> 01:16:39.710
Why've you got cotton
when you can have silk?

01:16:47.007 --> 01:16:48.382
Just look at her.

01:16:48.414 --> 01:16:49.598
She's got your eyes.

01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:51.039
I know.

01:16:51.071 --> 01:16:52.510
Greg's a dipshit.

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.398
He's so fucking
self-absorbed.

01:16:54.462 --> 01:16:57.502
We could have five more and
he wouldn't work it out.

01:16:58.334 --> 01:17:00.222
Way too pretty to be
his.

01:17:01.022 --> 01:17:02.974
So he's heading
straight to Manchester Airport?

01:17:03.006 --> 01:17:07.134
Yeah, and obviously,
we're going to Liverpool.

01:17:08.446 --> 01:17:10.878
Well, I do hope he
makes it out.

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:12.638
Me too.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.111
I love you, Gemma.

01:17:14.143 --> 01:17:15.326
I always have.

01:17:15.358 --> 01:17:16.638
I love you, too, Dan.

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.023
I'd like to report some screams

01:18:01.055 --> 01:18:03.839
coming from 15 Felix Stowe Road.

01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:07.390
There's something very, very
brutal going on in there,

01:18:08.158 --> 01:18:10.302
you should send someone over
sharpish.

01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:12.447
Yeah, thank you.

01:18:36.447 --> 01:18:37.567
What the fuck is he doing?

01:18:37.599 --> 01:18:38.846
I don't know.

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.087
I'm going down.

01:18:45.119 --> 01:18:46.239
No, no, no.

01:18:46.398 --> 01:18:49.662
For this to work, he needs
to discover us himself.

01:18:50.654 --> 01:18:53.118
Greg thinks the gun Dan gave
him was real,

01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:55.390
and he actually shot Baxter.

01:18:55.422 --> 01:18:58.941
It is now that he must actively
come to rekindle his love

01:18:58.974 --> 01:19:00.798
for his baby and his wife,

01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:03.519
relishing in you the connection
he momentarily doubted.

01:19:03.551 --> 01:19:06.782
Our analysis strongly suggests
that the psychological gains

01:19:06.814 --> 01:19:09.886
of this entire scenario will be
diluted...

01:19:09.919 --> 01:19:10.846
Fuck that.

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:12.285
We'll be here all night.

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:17.118
Where the fuck is he?

01:19:21.759 --> 01:19:22.687
What the fuck?

01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:27.167
What the fuck.

01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:30.910
They were blanks.

01:19:32.638 --> 01:19:34.047
This can't be right.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:16.400
