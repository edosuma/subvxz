- Yes, of course.
- So, hopefully, it will rule him out.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.714
OK.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.916
- (Sighs)
- Thank you.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.595
- Hey, you silly bollocks, you!
- lt was just supposed to float up to the top...

13:58.680 --> 14:02.559
l thought the wife was stupid, but the husband
seems to be missing a chromosome.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.829
(Screams)

14:12.440 --> 14:13.919
(Cackles)

14:24.360 --> 14:27.989
l'll have you!

14:28.080 --> 14:29.798
Oh, yes!

14:29.880 --> 14:31.757
<i>Come on, then!</i>

14:31.840 --> 14:33.512
Yeah, get off!

14:38.480 --> 14:40.914
Come on, Bill. Let's go.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.798
Look, Natalie, Natalie, Natalie...

14:43.880 --> 14:45.916
David, l believe we should be going as well.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.752
- See you!
NATALlE: Shut up!

14:47.840 --> 14:49.159
Thanks, lads.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.195
Ah!

14:53.640 --> 14:54.789
(Laughs)

14:58.640 --> 15:00.596
ls everyone dancing?

15:02.720 --> 15:04.153
<i>(Retching)</i>

15:06.040 --> 15:07.598
(Toilet flushes)

15:13.120 --> 15:15.509
- Are you OK?
- lt must be something l ate.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.910
- What?
- Maybe those mussels at the weekend.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.629
- Well, you should see a doctor, eh?
- Yeah, l've got an appointment for today.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.915
- Don't worry, l'm sure it's nothing.
- OK.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.470
We didn't have mussels at the weekend!

15:35.080 --> 15:37.036
(Phone rings)

15:43.600 --> 15:45.033
Rachel Bradley's office.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.235
Oh.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.754
Hi. Yeah, hi, Brian, it's Adam. ls Rachel there?

15:48.840 --> 15:51.149
- She's still at the hospital.
- Hospital?

15:51.240 --> 15:55.153
- l thought she was going to see a doctor?
- That's where you find doctors.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.639
Yeah, thanks, Brian.

15:56.720 --> 16:00.110
God, it must be more serious than l thought.
Has she gone to casualty?

16:01.120 --> 16:03.111
lt just says Doctor Habibi.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.156
OK, thanks, Brian. Bye.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.956
Excuse me. l'm looking for a Rachel Bradley.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.832
We've got a Robert Bradley.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.831
l'm sure her name is Rachel.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.594
- She's seeing a Doctor Habibi.
- Ah, right. Next block. Third floor.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.874
Thanks.

16:45.960 --> 16:46.949
Sorry.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.917
This is your 1 2-week scan, is it?

16:49.000 --> 16:52.959
More or less. Actually, more or less
would be good if it's by a couple of weeks.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.715
Oh, well, you'll soon know.
ls your partner not with you?

16:56.800 --> 16:59.155
No, he's got a really important meeting, so...

16:59.240 --> 17:00.753
But he is supportive, is he?

17:00.840 --> 17:04.150
Oh, yes, very. He just couldn't make it.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.757
Thank you.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.270
- Er...Dr Habibi?
- Up there on your left.

17:10.359 --> 17:11.679
Thanks.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.309
Oh, hi! l'm looking for Rachel Bradley.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.038
l'm her boyfriend.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.712
Oh! Congratulations!

17:24.800 --> 17:26.597
For being her boyfriend?

17:26.680 --> 17:28.271
She's just down here.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.312
lt all looks perfectly healthy.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.389
Mmm?

17:39.800 --> 17:43.395
l'm going to take some measurements,
then l'll give you your due date.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.754
Oh, thank you.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.109
(Coughs)

17:49.800 --> 17:51.392
- Adam?
- Hi, Rach.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.834
l thought you might like some moral support.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.717
This is my boyfriend.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.677
Oh, well, pull up a chair. Come take a look.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.069
<i>- ls that all right?
- Of course.</i>

18:01.160 --> 18:02.479
Thanks.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.158
<i>DR HABlBl: What do you make of that?</i>

18:07.480 --> 18:08.993
ls it a kidney stone?

18:12.400 --> 18:13.879
Don't they know what it is?

18:13.960 --> 18:17.430
lt's too early to say.
At 20 weeks, we'll be able to tell its sex.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.078
We need to talk.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.239
Oh, dear.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.510
- What are you staring at?
- You. l'm trying to imagine you as a father.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.878
Hah! l've tried that myself.
l looked in the mirror. Did not work.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.349
Well, you've got nine months to think about it.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.829
Less if she's just had a scan.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.794
How did you react when the penny dropped?

18:53.880 --> 18:56.075
How could l react?
l had to pretend l was pleased.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.675
Well! Haaaa! Phwoooh! Mmm!

19:03.800 --> 19:06.234
Och! Give me a break! lt was a surprise.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.952
Yeah, but why didn't she tell you?

19:10.960 --> 19:12.393
Good question.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.232
Why didn't you tell me?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.629
Well, it's a bit complicated.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.472
What? Because of your job?

19:19.800 --> 19:20.915
Yeah.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.319
There you go.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.316
<i>KAREN: So did you tell him?</i>

19:28.200 --> 19:30.589
l...l couldn't!

19:30.680 --> 19:33.148
Not with the gynaecologist there.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.949
And besides, she hadn't worked out
my dates yet, so l didn't know it was an issue.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.393
And is it?

19:38.480 --> 19:39.833
Yes.

19:39.920 --> 19:43.037
Still, it narrows the field down to two, doesn't it?

19:44.080 --> 19:45.433
(Sighs)

19:48.720 --> 19:51.712
- You're still going to have to tell Adam.
- But it might be his!

19:51.800 --> 19:53.756
Yeah, and what if it's not?

20:04.760 --> 20:07.593
lf you want to stare at tit,
why don't you buy Playboy?

20:09.760 --> 20:10.954
Pardon?

20:12.040 --> 20:13.871
Oh, l'm sorry. Sorry.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.911
lt's just l'm expecting a baby.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.549
Well, not me, obviously. My girlfriend.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.758
Oh, right.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.070
- First, is it?
- Yeah.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.271
You're not sure about it.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.316
How do you know that?

20:35.560 --> 20:37.516
lt's a big change.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.112
The biggest.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.916
How did your partner react?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.197
He left me. Now we're fighting for custody.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.114
l'm sorry.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.555
lt's all right. We were having problems before.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.790
l thought a baby might help.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.557
l've heard a lot of couples do that.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.108
lt explains why the divorce rate's so high.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.396
Have you ever held a baby before?

21:10.480 --> 21:13.836
Just my godson. He's named after me.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.873
The best bit's handing him back.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.438
Do you mind if l have a wee hold?

21:32.320 --> 21:35.073
- What's his name?
- Maggie.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.278
lt's an unusual name for a boy.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.671
Hello, Maggie. Hello, darling.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.115
Ha! Oooh! Aah!

21:45.200 --> 21:47.156
You're a natural.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.593
Do you think so?

21:49.520 --> 21:51.431
ls this your new bloke?

21:51.520 --> 21:52.953
Stu!

21:53.040 --> 21:56.510
- You didn't waste any time, did you, you slag?
- There seems to be a mistake.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.556
You, shut it!

21:58.640 --> 22:01.313
- No, mate, you don't understand.
- l warned you! Didn't l?

22:01.760 --> 22:03.716
(Lift door pings)

22:05.600 --> 22:06.828
David.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.828
Natalie!

22:09.640 --> 22:11.790
- Working late?
- l'm glad l caught you.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.836
Oh, l've been in meetings all day.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.309
You know what it's like for senior management.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.799
l'm hoping to one day.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.471
l wanted to apologise for last night.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.393
Oh, David, you don't have to apologise.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.189
- lt's very good of you to say that.
- But your friend should. What was her name?

22:31.280 --> 22:34.078
Jenny. Jenny Gifford.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.799
Jenny Gifford, yes.

22:36.880 --> 22:40.714
Well, of course, there's the damage to the dress,
plus the personal distress.

22:40.800 --> 22:45.669
Ordinarily, l'd sue her ass off,
but then this isn't the States unfortunately.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.877
So l guess l'll have to settle
for a letter of apology.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.151
- l'll dictate one in the morning.
- Not you, David.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.798
Jenny Gifford.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.029
(Ping)

22:57.120 --> 22:59.998
- Yeah. OK, then. Well, l'll see you then.
(Front door opens)

23:00.080 --> 23:01.354
Yeah. Bye!

23:06.440 --> 23:09.398
- Hi.
- Oh, my God! What happened to your eye?

23:09.480 --> 23:13.359
Oh, just some bloke.
He thought l was trying to be a father to his child.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.317
Rach, l've been thinking.
Erm...we should go out to dinner.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.360
Yeah, fine. Well, l'll go and have a bath.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.749
No, no, no, not tonight. Tomorrow.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.315
OK.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.989
OK.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.478
Cheers.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.788
Thank you.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.871
Thanks for coming.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.796
Thanks for inviting us.

23:49.880 --> 23:53.316
- Gosh, aren't we being polite?
- Look, David, erm...

23:53.400 --> 23:54.719
(Clears throat)

23:54.800 --> 23:56.836
l want to apologise.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.754
l had a little bit too much to drink
the other night and erm...

24:00.840 --> 24:04.116
l'm really sorry if l embarrassed you.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.872
<i>Sorry.</i>

24:06.640 --> 24:08.198
Apology accepted.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.279
(Both talk at once)

24:11.360 --> 24:14.158
<i>- Sorry.
- Sorry. No, after you.</i>

24:14.240 --> 24:16.196
No, l was just going to say,

24:16.280 --> 24:19.317
what do you think
of this Adam and Rachel news, then?

24:19.400 --> 24:21.675
<i>- Bit of a surprise.
- lsn't it?</i>

24:21.760 --> 24:25.150
- l think Adam's struggling with it a bit.
- Oh, l dunno, he's coming round.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.719
What do you mean by that?

24:30.120 --> 24:31.838
l can't. l promised l wouldn't.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.478
What?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.032
- Tell you.
- Come on, Pete!

24:38.120 --> 24:40.839
Well, you know they're going out
for dinner tonight?

24:44.280 --> 24:46.589
Adam's going to propose.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.794
Well...

24:57.280 --> 24:58.952
lt was delicious.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.439
lt was good.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.633
- Hey!
- Dessert menu?

25:02.720 --> 25:04.915
- Er, no, we'll just have coffee.
- Yes, please!

25:05.000 --> 25:06.797
l'm terribly sorry.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.474
Your coffees will be with you presently.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.039
- Thanks.
- All right.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.518
Hey, Guido, hey!

25:13.600 --> 25:15.670
l quite fancied some ice cream.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.716
Apparently, it's not very good here.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.677
The ice cream?

25:20.600 --> 25:22.556
Yeah. lt's bizarre, isn't it?

25:25.200 --> 25:27.509
..and the smell of burnt sprouts in the morning!

25:27.600 --> 25:28.715
(Laughter)

25:28.800 --> 25:31.360
You know Natalie, my boss?

25:31.440 --> 25:34.238
Yeah, right. The one with
the sense of humour stuck up her arse.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.279
Precisely. She wants you to write her
a letter of apology.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.396
- No!
- Give over!

25:41.920 --> 25:44.753
And she says she'll take it out on me if you don't.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.068
No!

25:46.160 --> 25:48.071
- Oh, no!
- You're making it up.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.639
Yes!

25:52.680 --> 25:53.635
Yes.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.193
You did ruin her dress.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.991
She called you a moron, you moron.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.311
Yes, and there's the cost of her dress as well.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.234
<i>Look, l'll tell you what. We'll go halves,</i>

26:11.320 --> 26:14.915
if you could just see your way
to scribbling a quick note?

26:15.880 --> 26:17.598
That seems fair, Jenny.

26:17.680 --> 26:20.114
<i>lt did look expensive.</i>

26:20.200 --> 26:23.909
<i>DAVlD: Or l could dictate it for you, if you like?</i>

26:24.000 --> 26:25.718
All you've got to do is sign.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.031
Yeah, right. Very much like a confession.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.073
No, David. No.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.039
Sorry, no. Apologising to you,
yeah, fair enough. But Natalie, no.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.588
<i>We've still got our pride.</i>

26:39.680 --> 26:42.717
Right, we'll pay for the dress ourselves.
How much do you reckon?

26:46.520 --> 26:48.351
- Signorina.
- Thanks.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.874
- E signore.
- Thank you.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.154
You know the one subject
we haven't mentioned tonight?

26:57.680 --> 27:00.114
Yeah. l thought you'd been avoiding it.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.235
No.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.469
l have.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.156
Well, maybe we should discuss it now.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.992
Yeah. Yeah.

27:09.920 --> 27:14.038
- Adam, the thing is...
- No, no, no. Please. Let me.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.392
The last few days, Rach,
l've been doing a lot of thinking.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.232
About you.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.912
About me.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.072
About the three of us.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.913
<i>FEMALE CHORUS: ♪ One, two, three, four

28:21.480 --> 28:23.436
l've still got your spare key.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.518
Congratulations?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.072
He told you?

28:36.160 --> 28:38.390
Mmm. He kept it to himself...

28:38.480 --> 28:40.311
for five minutes.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.834
- Where is he?
- We had a row.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.477
Tell me.

<i>ADAM: At first, l thought they were tears ofjoy.</i>

29:22.840 --> 29:24.796
<i>..when she was still crying...</i>

29:26.760 --> 29:28.716
..l knew there was a problem.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.911
That's when she told you?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.311
- l'm so sorry, Adam.
- (Sobs)

29:41.400 --> 29:43.231
l'm so sorry.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.360
- (Sobs)
- Oh, Rachel!

29:49.120 --> 29:51.076
Karen, have you seen my...?

29:57.520 --> 30:01.195
Karen, l'll never forget the look on his...face.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.713
lt's all right.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.918
lt's all right, it's all right.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.389
l promise. l promise.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.793
lt'll be all right.

30:23.800 --> 30:24.994
All right?

31:03.400 --> 31:06.392
- Sorry!
- Sorry. No, l'm sorry.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.755
- l don't know what came over me.
- No, nor me.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.910
Yeah. Probably best forgotten.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.194
Definitely.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.713
Adam who?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.513
Sorry.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.033
Tea!

31:18.120 --> 31:19.314
Come on.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.436
Er, well...

31:21.520 --> 31:22.794
Er...

31:22.880 --> 31:24.632
teapot, tea.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.195
(Door opens)

31:34.520 --> 31:37.318
- Adam. What are you doing here?
- l'm just going to bed.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.799
Oh, right.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.070
- Tea! Hey?
- Yeah.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.513
Yeah.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.033
Tea.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.593
They expect what?

31:54.680 --> 31:58.514
Hey, you tell them if they want to go
to the Met over this, they picked the right guy.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.796
David, what can l do for you?

32:01.880 --> 32:04.235
Er, Jenny, my friend from the other night?

32:04.320 --> 32:06.311
She's asked me to give you this.

32:14.880 --> 32:18.190
<i>- ls this all?
- lf it's not enough, l'll make up the difference.</i>

32:18.280 --> 32:21.477
No, no, no. lt's not that.
Where's the word ''sorry''?

32:21.560 --> 32:23.835
l was rather hoping you were joking about that.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.229
David, have you ever known me to joke?

32:27.680 --> 32:29.636
l'll talk to her again.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.153
You do that.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.916
Does she still love him?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.718
She says not.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.837
Claims it was all a dreadful mistake.

32:40.920 --> 32:43.070
Well, she did send him packing.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.309
Great.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.278
She was having a rough time,
she was going through a divorce.

32:47.360 --> 32:51.353
Oh, yeah, right. So she sleeps with a guy
she's divorcing, now she's expecting his baby?

32:51.440 --> 32:53.351
Unless it's yours.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.474
They can't tell?

32:56.560 --> 32:59.028
Well, they can't see the family resemblance!

33:02.000 --> 33:03.672
l don't know, Pete.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.999
- Maybe we're just not suited.
- Of course you are!

33:08.080 --> 33:12.756
Well, first of all she does this, and then
my reaction is to snog...someone else.

33:12.840 --> 33:13.989
What?

33:14.080 --> 33:15.229
No! Go on, who?

33:15.320 --> 33:18.915
l was...speaking hypothetically.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.115
Oh.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.759
So what are you going to do?

33:28.080 --> 33:29.354
Drink.

33:34.800 --> 33:35.949
(Phone rings)

33:36.040 --> 33:37.758
(Dog yaps)

33:42.960 --> 33:47.078
<i>JENNY ON ANSWERPHONE:

33:47.160 --> 33:50.869

34:07.840 --> 34:09.193

Me?

34:16.440 --> 34:18.556
<i>- A dad?

34:21.960 --> 34:23.074
Wow.

34:24.159 --> 34:25.513
But also...

34:25.600 --> 34:27.636
possibly not.

34:27.719 --> 34:28.869
Yeah.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.359
Yeah, sure.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.396
How did Adam take it?

34:39.440 --> 34:41.396
Not as well as you.

34:43.639 --> 34:44.958
ln fact...

34:45.040 --> 34:47.395
we haven't seen each other since.

34:47.480 --> 34:48.708
We've split up.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.319
Oh, really?

34:53.920 --> 34:56.434
Does that mean you might be
on your own with the kid?

34:58.040 --> 34:59.996
lt's looking like that.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.592
<i>lt needn't.</i>

35:05.120 --> 35:06.235
l er...

35:08.600 --> 35:09.749
OK.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.516
You know l'm crazy about you, don't you?

35:17.640 --> 35:19.676
Always have been. (Laughs)

35:19.760 --> 35:21.432
And er...

35:23.520 --> 35:24.714
That night,

35:24.800 --> 35:26.597
when we slept together,

35:26.680 --> 35:29.592
l...l know we were both drunk.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.876
lt was more than that, though, wasn't it?

35:36.400 --> 35:38.152
Leastways, it may well be.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.312
Look, Rach...

35:43.240 --> 35:45.196
l would love to have a kid with you.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.759
Even Adam's.

35:51.720 --> 35:52.869
Yeah?

35:57.760 --> 35:59.671
Oh, Kris.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.475
That's not what this is about.

36:07.240 --> 36:10.471
l just thought that you had a right to know.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.873
l love Adam. l want the baby to be his.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.988
And if it's mine?

36:24.000 --> 36:27.072
Well, then, you have
as much access as you want.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.119
To the baby.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.951
Hello, come in.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.717
Will you and David come round to ours
at 6:30 tomorrow?

37:13.800 --> 37:16.155
Yeah, sure. Are you all right?

37:16.240 --> 37:18.151
l'll see you tomorrow.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.148
Bye!

37:23.360 --> 37:27.069
''l know you didn't intend your
comments to be taken personally,

37:28.560 --> 37:31.313
and l regret the way in which l overreacted.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.994
l hope you'll accept my apology.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.548
Yours sincerely, Jenny Gifford.''

37:37.920 --> 37:40.309
- Satisfied?
- Well, it's all there.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.630
l think we can call this an end to the matter.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.517
Just one thing.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.477
Why is Jenny's signature on the letter

37:48.560 --> 37:50.949
completely different from
the one on her cheque?

37:51.040 --> 37:53.793
<i>As though they were written
by two different people?</i>

38:18.280 --> 38:20.236
- Wanker!
- (Giggles)

38:58.960 --> 38:59.915
Oi!

39:00.000 --> 39:01.956
l want a word with you.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.314
Oh, Christ.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.556
l want to say l'm sorry.

39:06.640 --> 39:07.868
Sorry?

39:07.960 --> 39:09.757
For having a go the other day.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.876
lt was bang out of order.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.715
So...

39:13.800 --> 39:15.836
lt looks to be healing up nicely.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.799
(Doorbell)

39:21.320 --> 39:24.437
- So, who else has she invited?
- l don't know.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.670
- What's it for, anyway?
- l don't know!

39:27.920 --> 39:29.592
l don't see why we had to come round.

39:29.680 --> 39:32.319
lt's not as if you two are averse
to using the phone.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.469
David!

39:34.280 --> 39:35.793
(Front door closes)

39:35.880 --> 39:37.836
(Voices and laughter)

39:38.840 --> 39:40.831
<i>- Jenny!
- David!</i>

39:48.560 --> 39:49.709
Look, l'm...

39:50.720 --> 39:52.073
Jenny, l...

39:54.680 --> 39:56.352
l owe you an apology.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.954
<i>l shouldn't have asked you to write to Natalie.</i>

40:00.440 --> 40:02.635
After all, she got what she deserved.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.239
Well...

40:08.760 --> 40:11.274
Cheers, David. Cheers.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.191
l appreciate that.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.955
Please!

40:17.680 --> 40:19.033
<i>PETE: So...</i>

40:19.120 --> 40:20.758
What about Natalie?

40:20.840 --> 40:22.717
Well, l saw her earlier.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.399
You're right.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.789
<i>Jenny didn't write the letter.</i>

40:27.880 --> 40:30.314
Jenny doesn't owe you an apology.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.595
And, in fact, l'm not going to ask her for one.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.240
l'm loyal to my friends, Natalie.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.880
l know that's not something
you respect or recognise.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.155
But for me, it is something to be valued.

40:40.240 --> 40:43.789
Now, l've heard tell that you're in danger
of being shunted off into Research.

40:43.880 --> 40:46.348
<i>That's a bit of a dead-end job.</i>

40:47.240 --> 40:49.800
Now, that's Sir Donald's decision, isn't it?

40:49.880 --> 40:51.791
What's Sir Donald got to do with this?

40:51.880 --> 40:55.077
<i>Nothing. lt'sjust he and l happen to be
members of the same golf club.</i>

40:55.160 --> 40:57.958
l'm drawn against him next week
in the Challenge Cup.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.396
lt might help if you were to talk to him.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.277
For a friend,

41:03.360 --> 41:05.157
l might even lose.

41:08.160 --> 41:11.277
<i>DAVlD: And, of course,
what Natalie doesn't realise</i>

41:11.360 --> 41:14.158
<i>is Sir Donald plays off-scratch
and l'd have lost anyway.</i>

41:14.240 --> 41:17.118
- You're such a bullshitter!
- That's what they pay me for.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.472
- There you go.
- Great.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.199
ls this why you invited us round here?

41:23.280 --> 41:24.474
What?

41:24.560 --> 41:28.109
Well, the whole kiss-and-make-up rubbish?

41:28.200 --> 41:29.952
l didn't know you'd fallen out.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.189
Oh, right.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.191
Why are we here, then?

41:34.280 --> 41:36.077
To say goodbye.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.798
You live here.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.119
No, l don't.

41:43.640 --> 41:46.518
l'm leaving...Manchester.

41:47.480 --> 41:51.075
l've given up my job
and l'm going to live in London with my sister

41:51.160 --> 41:52.832
until the baby's born.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.869
Yeah, so we managed to patch things up.

41:59.400 --> 42:00.992
l'm glad to hear it.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.396
How are things with you?

42:06.440 --> 42:08.351
Not great.

42:08.440 --> 42:12.911
lt turns out my girlfriend might be pregnant
by another bloke.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.951
What are you going to do?

42:17.040 --> 42:18.996
l still haven't decided.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.951
Well, l know what l'd do.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.996
l'd kill him.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.076
Anyone who'd been near my missus.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.957
And then l'd kill her.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.558
Nice thought.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.117
Not really my style, though.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.958
No, l can see that.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.951
Rachel, l realise
there's a certain degree of shame

42:42.040 --> 42:45.316
regarding the baby's parentage,
but...leaving town?

42:45.400 --> 42:47.231
David, it's nothing to do with shame.

42:47.320 --> 42:50.357
l just... l can't be here any more.

42:52.280 --> 42:54.236
l have to go away.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.834
We'll really miss you, Rach.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.996
Not as much as l'll miss you.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.712
Please don't hate me.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.189
Oh, Rach.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.673
When do you go?

43:14.760 --> 43:16.876
My taxi's just outside now, actually.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.679
And my train goes in half an hour, so...

43:19.760 --> 43:23.275
Would one of you
give me a hand down with my bags?

43:23.360 --> 43:26.193
You know, a lady in my condition.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.198
Do you love her?

43:33.200 --> 43:34.713
(Resigned laugh)

43:34.800 --> 43:36.756
Despite her faults?

43:36.840 --> 43:39.308
Believe me, it's the only way.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.231
Then maybe you should swallow your pride,
get back together.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.675
lt doesn't mean to say you can't still hurt him.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.228
After all, the child's going to need his father...

43:50.880 --> 43:52.552
..even if it isn't his own.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.712
Do you think so?

43:56.800 --> 43:58.870
l can't think of a more graphic way.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.916
Yeah, since you've ruled out violence.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.352
l've gotta go.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.555
Thanks.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.551
- See you.
- Ta-da.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.033
Rachel!

44:29.520 --> 44:30.669
Rach?

44:32.800 --> 44:34.358
<i>Rachel!</i>

44:39.720 --> 44:41.312
Come on, come on, come on!

44:41.400 --> 44:43.197
Jen, you were with Rach. Where is she?

44:44.320 --> 44:45.594
She's gone.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.955
<i>- Gone?
- She gave us a letter to give to you.</i>

44:48.040 --> 44:51.077
- Where has she gone?
- London.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.310
<i>To live with her sister.</i>

44:53.400 --> 44:56.358
She's catching the 7:30 train.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.749
- Sorry, Adam.
(Line goes dead)

44:58.840 --> 45:00.068
Adam?

45:11.800 --> 45:13.756
(Piano music swells)

45:14.400 --> 45:16.152
(Train whistle)

45:19.040 --> 45:20.359
Rachel!

45:23.320 --> 45:24.548
Rachel!

45:25.520 --> 45:26.635
Adam!

45:27.440 --> 45:30.113
GUARD: All aboard now, please!

45:30.200 --> 45:31.679
Don't go. Stay.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.035
l don't care whose the baby is. l'll be its father.

45:34.120 --> 45:37.749
- Oh, Adam, do you mean that?
- Yes. Anything so long as we can be together.

45:37.840 --> 45:38.875
Yes.

45:41.520 --> 45:42.794
- Adam!
- Rachel!

45:42.880 --> 45:44.518
l...Adam, l...

45:45.800 --> 45:47.074
Adam!

45:47.160 --> 45:48.991
Rachel!

45:49.080 --> 45:51.833
Adam! Adam!

46:01.680 --> 46:05.673
<i>The train now standing at platform four
is the 1 9.:30 to London Euston.</i>

46:11.280 --> 46:13.350
- Let's see your ticket.
- l haven't got one.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.829
- The office is over there.
- l'm not going anywhere.

46:15.920 --> 46:19.515
- Not without a ticket, you won't.
- No, l just need to see someone on the train!

46:19.600 --> 46:22.160
Only passengers are allowed on the platform.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.559
(Gate closes)

46:27.080 --> 46:28.149
Oi!

46:28.240 --> 46:30.196
(Hiss of coffee machine)

46:30.280 --> 46:32.236
(Train doors slam)

46:37.320 --> 46:38.355
Rachel!

46:39.760 --> 46:40.875
Rachel!

46:43.960 --> 46:46.269
- Adam?
- Rachel, don't go. Stay.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.590
l don't care whose baby it is. l'll be its father.

46:48.680 --> 46:51.911
- l wanted to go without seeing you.
- What? Why?

46:52.000 --> 46:53.672
Well, because l...

46:56.040 --> 46:58.315
Because l hate myself.

46:58.400 --> 47:01.597
l've ruined everything.
lt could never be the same between us again.

47:01.680 --> 47:05.355
- l love you! Enough for both of us.
- Enough for three?

47:05.440 --> 47:07.749
- Yes. Even if it's his.
- You can't say that.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.478
- l can! l did.
- You can't mean it.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.516
- l do!
(Guard's whistle)

47:11.600 --> 47:13.795
Rachel, please, you've got to get off this train.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.030
<i>Adam, it is his.</i>

47:21.080 --> 47:22.229
ls it?

47:25.760 --> 47:27.273
You see?

47:28.560 --> 47:32.155
You want to mean it, but you can't,
until you know for sure.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.756
ls it his?

47:39.280 --> 47:40.679
Oh, l don't know.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.197
That's the whole point, isn't it?

47:44.280 --> 47:48.114
Every day that l'm pregnant, we'll be wondering.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.997
And dreading the moment of truth.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.513
Well...

47:51.600 --> 47:53.352
l can't go through that, Adam,

47:53.440 --> 47:55.396
for the baby's sake.

47:57.080 --> 48:00.470
<i>GUARD: You're going to have
to close that door! Now!</i>

48:18.400 --> 48:19.833
(Guard's whistle)

48:49.400 --> 48:50.992
She's gone.

48:53.360 --> 48:55.316
Come on, mate. Let's go home, yeah?
