WEBVTT

02:11.965 --> 02:15.092
I love you, Lisa. I love you, Lisa.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.094
I love you so much.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.849
Listen to me, Lisa.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.393
Hey, Lisa.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.773
I have something to tell you, Lisa.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.316
Listen to me.

02:31.401 --> 02:40.659
I have something to tell you, Lisa.

02:46.875 --> 02:47.833
Mama?

02:47.917 --> 02:49.710
Oh, God!

02:55.258 --> 02:57.217
What are you doing up, sweetie?

03:00.096 --> 03:01.763
Did you have another bad dream?

03:02.056 --> 03:03.640
l dreamed about a swing.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.935
ls there one at the new house?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.188
Well, if there isn't,

03:09.272 --> 03:11.565
l bet your daddy might just
put one up for you.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.528
Come on.
Let's go get some breakfast, okay?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.739
-l'll meet you in there.
-Okay.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.796
What does the new house look like?

03:35.465 --> 03:37.341
lt's way out in the country

03:37.425 --> 03:40.719
and there's just lots of room for you to play.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.137
Can we bring my bike?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.223
Of course we can bring your bike, sweetie.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.016
Even though l don't know how to ride it yet?

03:46.100 --> 03:50.479
You are gonna have lots of places to learn
how to ride your bike.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.693
-Hey! Heidi!
-Daddy!

04:00.615 --> 04:02.866
-You done good, Daddy.
-Why, thank you.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.160
What about you, huh? What do you think?

04:05.328 --> 04:06.745
Who lived there before?

04:06.829 --> 04:07.913
Nobody, honey.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.748
That's why the bank gave us
such a good deal, right?

04:09.832 --> 04:11.375
Why, thank you, Mama.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.753
Well, maybe you'd rather live in there?

04:15.004 --> 04:17.047
-No.
-That can be arranged.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.675
-No, thank you.
-You could have the whole place to yourself.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.343
-Nope. No, nope!
-Teddy bear could have his own room.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.095
Come on, let's go. l'll race you! Come on!

04:23.429 --> 04:25.347
Go, go, go! Race Mama!

04:39.112 --> 04:40.862
The hell, baby?

04:41.072 --> 04:42.781
You can't find a clearer station than that?

04:42.865 --> 04:44.366
We're out in the boondocks, babe.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.451
We're lucky we get running water.
Thank you.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.162
Well, we don't need water,
that's what beer is for.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.707
My beer, by the way.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.733
You! Git! God!

05:21.070 --> 05:22.738
Git!

05:25.908 --> 05:27.576
You think that's funny, do you?

05:55.104 --> 06:04.321
Aunt Joyce!

06:05.865 --> 06:08.075
Kid, you grow like a weed!

06:08.576 --> 06:09.785
Hi!

06:10.995 --> 06:13.455
Look at you, Miss Homeowner.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.416
Well, that didn't take long.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.920
No suitcase?

06:20.004 --> 06:23.382
-l am not a freeloader, Andy.
-Today or historically?

06:23.466 --> 06:26.259
Stop it, Andy.
Joyce is just here to wish us well.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.637
ls that so?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.809
lt's a goddamn curse
being right all the time.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.936
lt truly is.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.317
lt didn't work out with Ray.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.986
Was he the married one or the drunk?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.656
Bit of both, turns out.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.076
-What about you? Are you...
-Eleven weeks sober.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.828
Shit, call Guinness.

06:53.329 --> 06:56.248
On second thought
that's probably a bad idea.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.340
l've got alimony coming in.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.634
l wanna be near family.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.846
Well, find a place near here, just not here.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.557
Who lives over there?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.809
That's just some old wreck
someone left behind.

07:15.893 --> 07:16.893
l'm gonna haul it away.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.562
A girl lives down there.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.690
Nobody lives around here, baby.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.024
When did you see a girl?

07:23.109 --> 07:24.234
Just now.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.696
You know, l've lived in worse.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.907
"Near here but not here," right?

07:32.034 --> 07:33.577
You did say that, babe.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.108
Stop it.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.580
Mama?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.084
Why are you crying?

09:06.462 --> 09:08.463
lt's nothing, sweetie. Nothing.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.258
Aunt Joyce is out front,

09:11.342 --> 09:14.970
so go say good night
and l'll come tuck you in, okay?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.681
Okay.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.646
Mama's crying.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.107
Do you know why she gets sad?

09:31.654 --> 09:35.782
Your mama gets feelings sometimes.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.577
Feelings she doesn't much care for.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.037
What kind of feelings?

09:42.039 --> 09:45.000
Tell you what. l want you to try something
for me. Can you do that?

09:46.669 --> 09:48.003
Look out there.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.257
At what?

09:52.675 --> 09:56.261
Don't really focus
on anything specific. Just...

09:57.138 --> 09:58.680
Take it all in.

10:09.859 --> 10:10.942
Feel anything?

10:11.527 --> 10:12.944
Help us...

10:14.447 --> 10:15.530
l think so.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.825
And sometimes...

10:20.703 --> 10:22.537
l see things.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.543
That's because you were
born with a veil, sweetie.

10:29.545 --> 10:32.631
Just like your mama and me. And our mama.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.299
What's a veil?

10:36.552 --> 10:38.970
lt means that when you were born,

10:39.096 --> 10:41.640
you had a sheen over your face,
like a wedding veil.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.559
And sometimes folks
born that way have a gift.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.852
They can...

10:47.188 --> 10:50.065
They can sense certain things
that other people can't.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.318
Mama never said anything about it.

10:53.402 --> 10:57.530
Your mama doesn't like this kind of
talk of gifts and feelings.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.034
So let's just keep this conversation
between us, okay?

11:01.118 --> 11:02.994
Now run to bed. Please.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.248
Love you.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.875
l love you, too.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.971
l know, Mama.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.183
Listen to me, Lisa.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.397
I have something to tell you.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.985
Listen to me, Lisa.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.154
I have something to tell you.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.574
Just be a good girl

12:26.078 --> 12:28.329
and listen to your mother.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.082
Listen to me!

12:34.211 --> 12:35.420
Lisa.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.174
lt's 6:00 a.m.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.176
How long you been in here this time?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.306
You saw something again, didn't you?

12:47.975 --> 12:49.100
Here.

12:52.104 --> 12:56.357
lf these pills ain't working, we sure
as hell shouldn't keep paying for them.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.444
They're working.

12:59.528 --> 13:02.405
Just gets a little tricky
when they wear off, that's all.

13:03.073 --> 13:06.159
You should finish getting dressed.
You'll be late for work.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.578
-All right, darling.
-Thank you.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.339
Careful, Heidi.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.176
-You need any help?
-l can do it.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.344
Okay.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.180
All right.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.169
Hey, neighbor.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.006
Heidi's been gone an hour
and l don't know where she is.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.925
-Well, she's probably just wandering.
-Heidi is not a wanderer.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.303
That's 'cause she's never had anywhere
to wander to. Now she does.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.096
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.347
Heidi!

14:51.432 --> 14:54.851
Baby, where have you been?
l've been worried sick.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.311
l'm not supposed to say.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.646
Who said that?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.774
Damn it, Heidi, who told you that?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.401
Mr. Gordy.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.490
Who's Mr. Gordy?

15:09.575 --> 15:10.742
An old man l met.

15:10.826 --> 15:14.412
He said there was a swing set in the woods,
just like in my dream.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.122
Remember, Mama?

15:16.665 --> 15:17.832
Okay.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.250
Okay, come here.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.046
Joyce, get Andy on the phone.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.843
This is it.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.262
Mr. Gordy told me there was a swing here.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.514
Well, babe, l don't see a swing.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.183
l'll be damned.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.353
There may not be a swing here now,
but there used to be.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.400
-Jesus.
-Walk much?

15:44.485 --> 15:48.029
Babe, did this Mr. Gordy
say anything else to you?

15:48.364 --> 15:50.949
He said there's money buried in the garden.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.075
Okay.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.118
Okay, sweetie, l want you
to do something for me.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.411
How much money?

15:55.496 --> 15:59.207
lf this Mr. Gordy
ever comes up to you again

15:59.291 --> 16:03.044
l want you to scream as loud as you can.
You understand me?

16:04.129 --> 16:05.129
Okay.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.215
Let's go.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.818
Andy?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.199
l'm not supposed to talk to you.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.619
They think you're a bad man.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.996
You're not.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.874
-Are you?
-Heidi?

18:56.218 --> 18:58.469
Was that Mr. Gordy you were talking to?

19:06.562 --> 19:10.148
Heidi, why didn't you tell us
that you had an imaginary friend?

19:10.232 --> 19:13.317
Mr. Gordy's not imaginary. He talks to me.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.237
I was standing right there watching,
there's nobody outside.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.157
-Mr. Gordy's real.
-Heidi, stop it.

19:19.616 --> 19:23.953
l don't wanna hear any more talk about
this Mr. Gordy. Do you understand?

19:25.247 --> 19:27.957
Seeing things that aren't there, it's just

19:28.041 --> 19:30.084
not a road that you wanna go down.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.546
Good night, okay?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.520
What the hell, Joyce?

19:49.605 --> 19:52.315
You've been here a week and Heidi's already
seeing invisible friends?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.692
Turns out this Mr. Gordy...

19:54.818 --> 19:55.943
He's up here.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.529
And you, encouraging her, coming out here,
digging up my garden,

19:58.614 --> 20:01.240
going on some wild goose...

20:21.553 --> 20:23.304
Don't be afraid.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.099
Let them in.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.533
Good Lord, woman.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.368
What'd you do, rob a shopping mall?

21:27.494 --> 21:30.288
Courtesy of my new sugar daddy, Mr. Gordy.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.373
Did you tell Heidi
where the money came from?

21:32.457 --> 21:35.084
No. And neither will you.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.962
l'm sure there's lots of stuff buried
in these parts.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.506
That doesn't mean that there's a Mr. Gordy.

21:40.632 --> 21:41.924
l beg to differ.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.510
Did you look at the deed to your house?
The previous owner?

21:45.095 --> 21:46.512
Yeah, the bank owned it.

21:46.596 --> 21:49.265
Before that. Check it out.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.726
Straight from the county assessor.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.728
Look at the name at the bottom.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.440
The Gordy family owned all this land
going back 200 years,

21:57.524 --> 22:00.192
and this J.S. Gordy was the last one.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.320
Then the bank got it in the '70s.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.448
Ask me how they got it.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.537
Okay, you're gonna get
one shot at this, all right?

22:11.621 --> 22:13.080
lf this doesn't go the way
l think it's gonna go,

22:13.165 --> 22:14.457
l'll never bring it up again.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.209
Deal.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.087
Heidi? Come out here a second.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.762
l am looking for a husband for you.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.640
They're all old. You marry them.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.185
-Good girl.
-Okay, pick a winner for me.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.103
But look at them all carefully first.
Can you do that?

22:51.161 --> 22:52.620
You see something, Heidi?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.377
You know that man?

23:07.177 --> 23:08.719
That's Mr. Gordy.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.388
Okay.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.600
Told you he was real.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.395
l told you and you didn't believe me.

23:35.705 --> 23:36.997
Damn it.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.007
My daughter is not conversing
with the dead.

23:47.092 --> 23:50.469
She picked Mr. Gordy's face
out of 50 pictures. Explain that.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.680
That's just your influence coming out in her.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.808
You know what, l don't want you talking
about any of this with Heidi anymore.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.978
You hear me? She is my daughter.
She can talk about it with me.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.022
Why would she? You don't listen.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.150
You just tell her what's what,
just like you did with me.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.152
You needed it. You know what, you still do.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.987
l suppose l'd be better off
numbing myself with pills?

24:08.071 --> 24:10.573
-Stop it.
-What, you don't think l know?

24:10.949 --> 24:12.825
That was Mama's trick, too.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.077
And that worked out beautifully for her.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.121
Joyce, go home.

24:17.205 --> 24:20.541
There's nothing wrong with Heidi.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.880
You know what it is, Lisa.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.050
lt's starting for her.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.025
Heidi?

24:47.402 --> 24:48.736
Are you awake?

25:14.429 --> 25:16.514
When I hear of a family moving to town,

25:16.598 --> 25:18.724
I visit to see if they've found a church yet.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.643
Because l happen to preside over one.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.270
Folks around here had been wondering

25:23.355 --> 25:26.106
when this rather special
piece of property would sell.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.734
Yeah? What's special about it?

25:29.236 --> 25:31.654
Aside from it being overgrown as all hell?

25:31.905 --> 25:33.030
Andy Wyrick.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.615
Pastor Jordan Wells.

25:35.116 --> 25:38.661
The property is special because
back around the time of the Civil War,

25:38.745 --> 25:41.747
it was the Station Master's land.
But l'm sure you knew that.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.499
What, like a railroad?

25:43.917 --> 25:45.125
No tracks on this land.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.545
No, it wasn't that kind of railroad.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.464
Do you mean, like,
the Underground Railroad?

25:51.132 --> 25:54.176
The folks who helped escaped slaves
make it up north? Wow.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.012
That's right. Those people
were known as station masters

25:57.472 --> 26:00.683
and one of the most well-known
lived right here on your land.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.977
He actually hid slaves on our property?

26:03.061 --> 26:04.061
Yes, ma'am.

26:04.145 --> 26:07.565
Hundreds of men, women and children
passed right through here

26:07.649 --> 26:10.985
with nothing but the clothes on their back
and the light of the moon to guide them.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.611
They didn't have flashlights?

26:12.988 --> 26:14.238
No, sweetie.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.532
They couldn't even use lanterns.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.327
The moonlight was the only light
that they ever saw.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.081
lt was the light of freedom
in the Promised Land.

26:24.499 --> 26:27.835
The Station Master
was an extraordinary man.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.504
Entire generations of families
would not exist

26:30.589 --> 26:33.966
if it was not for the Station Master
and this piece of land.

26:34.884 --> 26:36.260
So,

26:36.344 --> 26:39.013
don't be surprised if you get visitors
from time to time.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.472
Living ones, l hope.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.517
-As opposed to?
-Andy's just having a little fun.

26:44.519 --> 26:47.813
-l do that.
-Well, if you do get any visitors,

26:47.897 --> 26:52.151
l hope you'll be more welcoming than
the previous owner, J.S. Gordy, was.

26:52.235 --> 26:55.279
He didn't exactly share his ancestor's

26:55.363 --> 26:56.905
hospitable nature.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.283
Between you and me

26:59.367 --> 27:02.286
there was something seriously off
about that man.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.871
Mr. Gordy's nice to me.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.291
-Look, Pastor...
-Sweetie.

27:07.375 --> 27:09.918
We'd better get our day started.

29:01.614 --> 29:02.781
Hello?

29:56.753 --> 30:08.514
Help us.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.267
Mr. Gordy!

31:36.185 --> 31:37.561
What is that?

31:38.813 --> 31:40.314
Tell me what it is!

31:42.859 --> 31:45.152
-Heidi?
-Mr. Gordy!

31:45.612 --> 31:46.820
Heidi!

31:48.656 --> 31:50.324
You know what?

31:50.658 --> 31:53.327
l think there is an invisible man around here.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.121
lt's me.

31:58.833 --> 31:59.958
Did you miss your daddy?

32:00.043 --> 32:01.084
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

32:01.169 --> 32:02.336
Right answer.

32:02.503 --> 32:03.879
l've got a little surprise for you.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.506
-What is it?
-Oh, you'll find out. Come on.

32:08.551 --> 32:11.261
Look what l found in the back of
your daddy's truck.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.180
Heidi, meet Chief.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.973
Oh, my God!

32:15.058 --> 32:16.141
Daddy, l love him!

32:16.225 --> 32:18.685
Am l the greatest father
in the world or what?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.062
-You'll do.
-Thank you.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.480
l love you.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.802
Remember to bring Chief's bowl
back in the house after he's done.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.262
Where's Chief?

32:54.806 --> 32:57.307
Oh, for God's sake. Chief!

32:57.392 --> 33:00.268
Chief!

33:02.814 --> 33:04.147
Damn dog.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.029
Come on.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.156
lt's gonna be all right.

33:18.746 --> 33:19.830
Chief!

33:25.086 --> 33:26.420
Chief sounds hurt.

33:26.921 --> 33:29.756
Hey, Heidi, why don't you just sit down
right here for a second?

33:29.924 --> 33:31.299
Okay? And...

33:31.968 --> 33:33.301
Don't move.

33:34.721 --> 33:35.929
Be right back.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.808
Chief!

33:45.398 --> 33:47.399
Hey! Here, boy!

33:47.942 --> 33:49.276
Chief!

33:52.405 --> 33:53.447
Chief.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.867
How'd you get in there, boy?

34:00.329 --> 34:01.538
Daddy?

34:07.587 --> 34:09.087
Heidi.

34:14.092 --> 34:15.342
All right, watch out, boy.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.440
What the hell?

34:30.150 --> 34:31.485
Daddy?

34:32.737 --> 34:36.739
Heidi.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.078
Help us.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.458
Heidi?

34:50.922 --> 34:52.339
Heidi!

35:36.551 --> 35:38.385
Help us.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.436
Damn it!

35:49.313 --> 35:51.189
l thought l told you to sit tight.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.733
What are you hollerin' about over here?

36:03.244 --> 36:04.536
Come on.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.413
Let's get you home.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.007
Hey, babe.

36:17.383 --> 36:19.801
-You figure out what this thing is yet?
-Yeah.

36:21.512 --> 36:22.929
lt's a trap.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.765
See, you bait that chamber there.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.517
Animals, they get in

36:27.602 --> 36:29.227
and they can't get back out.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.021
They get weak and starve.

36:31.105 --> 36:32.564
Easy pickings.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.859
Then you get them back out through here.

36:36.068 --> 36:37.485
The back door.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.696
There's gotta be a better way to hunt.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.780
That's just cruel.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.199
No, it's smart.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.742
lf you're a taxidermist.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.036
Already found three more of 'em
in the woods.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.747
l figure they made good money
for someone, back in...

36:48.956 --> 36:52.459
Well, whenever the hell
they still used locks like these.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.463
Well, smash them all up so Chief
doesn't get stuck in them again.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.215
Or Heidi, for that matter.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.625
I love you, Lisa.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.377
Don't be afraid.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.130
Let them in.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.481
Hey.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.859
-What's going on, hon?
-Nothing.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.216
l have a bike.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.427
Do you?

38:27.096 --> 38:28.555
lt's pretty.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.348
lt's purpley.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.435
What do you mean?

38:34.228 --> 38:36.104
Really? People are coming?

38:36.731 --> 38:38.481
What kind of people?

38:38.899 --> 38:40.650
Who are you talking to now?

38:40.901 --> 38:42.444
Mr. Gordy.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.404
ls that right?

38:45.156 --> 38:46.906
Well, ask him where there's more money.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.992
l can't. He's gone.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.202
Next time then.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.581
He said there's people coming.

38:55.082 --> 38:56.082
Who?

38:58.669 --> 39:01.796
l swear, Heidi, we should take you
and Mr. Gordy on the road.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.965
Who's there?

39:05.426 --> 39:07.427
Stay behind me.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.098
l got an ax.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.608
Hello?

39:38.793 --> 39:40.168
What the hell is this place?

40:03.275 --> 40:04.734
Do you see her, too?

40:05.236 --> 40:06.236
Yeah.

40:11.158 --> 40:12.409
Mama Kay?

40:14.703 --> 40:15.912
lt's okay.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.832
My name's Prentiss.
This is my grandmother, Mama Kay.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.334
-ls this your property?
-That you're trespassing on, yes.

40:21.627 --> 40:22.669
We were told we could come back here.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.295
Yeah. Bullshit. By who?

40:24.380 --> 40:25.505
Woman in the trailer.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.174
Said she's your sister. Sold us this.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.136
Sister-in-law.

40:31.679 --> 40:32.720
What is that?

40:32.805 --> 40:34.139
The shoofly.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.933
Prentiss?

40:37.393 --> 40:39.811
Now help me sit on down.

40:40.187 --> 40:42.397
l wanna visit with the little one.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.149
Come on, little one.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.152
Be all right, young man.

40:49.655 --> 40:51.948
All right, you gonna tell me
why you came all the way out here

40:52.032 --> 40:53.825
just to buy some ratty old quilt?

40:53.909 --> 40:57.620
A long time ago, when this quilt
was hung out here in these woods,

40:57.705 --> 40:59.622
it meant it was safe to approach.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.749
Safe for who?

41:01.834 --> 41:04.711
Mama Kay's ancestors for one. Mine too.

41:05.212 --> 41:07.505
Do you even know
where you're living at, Mr...

41:07.756 --> 41:08.882
Andy.

41:09.425 --> 41:14.429
Our pastor said we might get visitors.
Something about an Underground Railroad.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.514
This was one of the stations.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.269
Mama Kay's always
wanted to visit this place.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.521
The guy saved a lot of lives, l reckon.

41:23.772 --> 41:25.899
And he deserved better than
what happened to him.

41:26.734 --> 41:30.612
You don't need eyes to see, little one.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.530
But you already know that.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.157
What do you mean?

41:34.241 --> 41:36.784
You asked your father

41:36.869 --> 41:38.995
if he saw me.

41:39.121 --> 41:42.248
Now, that makes you some kind of special.

41:42.583 --> 41:45.168
My mama says l'm not supposed to
talk about that.

41:45.252 --> 41:49.088
But you have to be careful
with a gift like that.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.257
Because sometimes

41:51.342 --> 41:54.594
the devil looks a gentleman.

41:57.556 --> 41:59.641
You're telling me

41:59.725 --> 42:02.727
all that took place on my property?

42:03.896 --> 42:05.021
Yes, sir.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.815
Right here.

42:08.817 --> 42:11.277
Guess your pastor left that part out.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.445
Yeah.

42:19.036 --> 42:20.286
Family meeting.

42:23.457 --> 42:26.751
Not you, kiddo.
You stay outside for a minute, all right?

42:26.835 --> 42:28.253
Okay, Daddy.

42:29.255 --> 42:30.713
Sit down, Joyce.

42:36.929 --> 42:39.764
That man told Daddy
what happened here, didn't he?

42:39.848 --> 42:41.099
Why can't I know?

42:41.183 --> 42:43.059
It's just not a story for little girls, sweetie.

42:43.143 --> 42:45.270
l'm a big girl. You always say that.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.316
You remember Pastor Wells
talking about the Station Master?

42:51.151 --> 42:53.861
Well, back when he owned all this land,

42:53.946 --> 42:56.990
he was what's called a taxidermist.

42:57.157 --> 43:00.868
He also did something that
he didn't tell anybody.

43:01.328 --> 43:05.623
He would help hide people
who were in trouble.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.919
People like Mama Kay's great-aunt, Nell,

43:10.004 --> 43:12.213
and her fiancÃ©, Levi.

43:12.965 --> 43:15.133
You see, Nell and Levi had fallen in love

43:15.301 --> 43:18.177
and had dreams of getting married
once they were safe

43:18.304 --> 43:19.304
and free.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.807
How the hell did people
even find their way out here?

43:22.891 --> 43:26.019
There were guides called conductors
who helped them.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.480
And these quilts, they were a code
from the Station Master

43:29.565 --> 43:30.690
telling them where he'd meet them.

43:30.983 --> 43:33.192
-Look here, you see this tree?
-Yeah.

43:35.070 --> 43:37.780
There it is, down there. The meeting place.

43:38.115 --> 43:41.909
The Station Master would come get them
and take them to a hiding place

43:41.994 --> 43:44.787
somewhere on this property
until it was safe to move on.

43:45.664 --> 43:50.043
Well, some of the other land owners, they

43:51.003 --> 43:53.212
found out what the Station Master
had been doing.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.007
Well, they didn't like it very much.

43:56.216 --> 43:58.009
So they did some

43:58.761 --> 44:01.179
very unkind things to him.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.651
They hurt him just for helping people?

44:14.735 --> 44:16.861
They didn't see it that way, sweetie.

44:16.945 --> 44:18.279
What happened to Nell?

44:18.530 --> 44:20.114
Did she make it up north?

44:20.199 --> 44:21.699
Nell and Levi never arrived.

44:23.077 --> 44:24.619
No one knows what happened to them.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.538
I told you something bad happened here.

44:27.623 --> 44:31.834
No, it was a long time ago.
All that evil is over and done with now.

44:31.919 --> 44:33.252
lt's still here, Mama.

44:33.379 --> 44:35.505
l can feel it. lt's in the woods.

44:35.589 --> 44:37.507
-lt's coming for me.
-No, it's not.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.801
Heidi...

44:40.678 --> 44:42.428
lt's all in your head.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.390
-lt's not real.
-But Mr. Gordy said....

44:45.933 --> 44:48.643
There is no Mr. Gordy.

44:48.727 --> 44:52.105
Heidi, listen to me. You have to fight this.

44:52.398 --> 44:56.150
-You have to put it out of your head or...
-l'll be like you?

45:06.370 --> 45:07.704
Dry off.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.206
lf you loved me, you'd believe me.

45:10.666 --> 45:13.292
lt's because l love you that l can't, baby.

45:21.510 --> 45:23.636
l don't hear you getting out of that tub.

45:27.182 --> 45:30.059
Heidi Wyrick, don't make me
come back in there.

45:35.816 --> 45:37.608
Heidi, what is taking so long?

45:46.285 --> 45:47.285
Heidi?

46:01.341 --> 46:03.426
Oh, my God, Heidi! Oh, my God! Oh, God!

46:05.679 --> 46:07.597
Okay, okay, okay!

46:07.681 --> 46:09.766
Come on, baby! Cough it up!

46:18.650 --> 46:19.776
Heidi!

46:32.748 --> 46:33.748
Lisa!

46:35.042 --> 46:36.083
Heidi!

46:36.460 --> 46:37.752
Andy.

46:38.962 --> 46:40.046
What happened?

46:40.798 --> 46:44.550
She was convulsing and unconscious.

46:44.635 --> 46:47.929
And vomiting sawdust and insects?

46:50.224 --> 46:52.475
-Andy.
-Are you on any medication, Mrs. Wyrick?

46:52.559 --> 46:55.478
You didn't see what l saw. l saw her.
You weren't there.

46:55.562 --> 46:57.063
Heidi.

46:58.232 --> 47:00.483
-Do you remember any of this?
-Yeah, baby.

47:00.567 --> 47:02.735
l didn't dry off like l was supposed to.

47:02.903 --> 47:06.030
So Mama pulled me out of the tub real hard.

47:06.114 --> 47:07.865
l'm sorry, that's not what happened.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.076
l think they've been through
enough for tonight.

47:12.746 --> 47:13.788
Come on.

47:18.335 --> 47:21.629
Just tell me exactly what
we're supposed to do here.

47:21.713 --> 47:25.174
lf you want my advice,
l suggest you consult with a psychiatrist.

47:25.592 --> 47:27.260
Or a priest.

47:28.178 --> 47:29.220
Thanks.

47:30.138 --> 47:32.640
-Andy...
-Let's let Heidi rest up a sec.

47:37.437 --> 47:39.313
lt's hard when people don't believe you.

47:41.275 --> 47:42.942
lsn't it?

47:48.615 --> 47:51.409
Really, Lisa?
We're possessed by the devil now?

47:51.493 --> 47:54.495
Good Lord, people,
it's a blessing, not an exorcism.

47:54.913 --> 47:56.289
Please.

47:58.625 --> 48:00.042
Hi.

48:00.460 --> 48:03.045
Lord, we pray this night

48:03.130 --> 48:05.214
for the soul of an innocent child

48:05.299 --> 48:07.800
and the banishment of evil from this land.

48:08.302 --> 48:11.596
l want you to pray with me now.
Can you do that?

48:18.979 --> 48:21.063
ln the name of the Father

48:21.148 --> 48:24.525
l ask for the cleansing of fear and sickness

48:24.610 --> 48:27.236
from the mind and the soul of this child.

48:27.404 --> 48:31.866
l ask that you fill Heidi with the warmth
of your love into her heart

48:32.284 --> 48:35.328
and that you call upon your angels
to watch over her

48:35.412 --> 48:37.413
and protect her from danger.

48:37.748 --> 48:41.167
Mom and Dad, would you lean down
and lay her back for me, please?

48:47.549 --> 48:49.425
ln the name of the Son,

48:49.509 --> 48:51.928
call upon your righteous hand

48:52.012 --> 48:56.265
to rid this place of all evil
that may roam here.

49:22.918 --> 49:24.335
Help us.

49:42.521 --> 49:45.272
l ask that you bless this child

49:45.732 --> 49:48.234
in the name of the Holy Ghost...

49:49.152 --> 49:51.070
The souls of the lost,

49:51.405 --> 49:53.572
forsaken and forgotten,

49:53.740 --> 49:58.327
and let your cleansing light
shine down upon this place

49:58.412 --> 50:02.081
and upon this little girl now and forever.

50:06.169 --> 50:22.601
Amen.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.480
May God's love fill your heart, child,

50:26.565 --> 50:30.109
and give you peace for all of your days.

50:31.403 --> 50:33.738
Now that wasn't so bad, was it?

50:35.240 --> 50:36.907
You did great.

52:10.252 --> 52:11.460
Mama?

53:03.930 --> 53:05.931
Pastor sent you away.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.207
Lisa!

55:18.023 --> 55:20.232
-Andy.
-Heidi's gone.

55:20.358 --> 55:21.483
What?

55:22.110 --> 55:23.944
Call the cops.

55:29.367 --> 55:54.850
Heidi!

55:54.934 --> 55:58.312
Daddy!

56:00.857 --> 56:01.940
Heidi!

56:06.738 --> 56:08.322
Daddy!

56:10.867 --> 56:12.951
-Any sign of her yet?
-No.

56:13.745 --> 56:17.998
Heidi!

56:18.625 --> 56:20.000
-Daddy!
-Heidi!

56:20.085 --> 56:22.711
-Help me!
-Where are you, baby?

56:22.796 --> 56:24.421
Down in the hole!

56:27.008 --> 56:28.092
What hole?

56:29.969 --> 56:31.220
Down here!

56:38.019 --> 56:39.353
Daddy!

56:39.771 --> 56:41.105
Oh, my God.

56:51.783 --> 56:52.741
Heidi.

56:52.826 --> 56:55.869
l can't get out, Daddy. l can't get out.

56:56.704 --> 56:59.289
Sit tight, Heidi. l gotta find
a way to get down there, baby.

56:59.374 --> 57:00.374
No!

57:04.045 --> 57:06.046
Heidi.

57:11.094 --> 57:16.723
Please!

57:17.517 --> 57:18.517
Shit!

57:20.979 --> 57:23.230
Please don't leave me
down here with them, Daddy!

57:25.233 --> 57:26.358
With who, Heidi?

57:34.784 --> 57:36.285
Heidi!

57:46.379 --> 57:49.715
Mr. Gordy? ls that you?

57:58.016 --> 58:01.059
-Daddy, help me!
-Coming!

58:04.022 --> 58:05.189
Daddy!

58:05.273 --> 58:06.648
Heidi!

58:07.317 --> 58:15.073
Daddy!

58:17.285 --> 58:25.083
Heidi.

58:35.470 --> 58:37.679
Oh, my God.

59:00.954 --> 59:02.079
Heidi!

59:03.122 --> 59:05.791
-Daddy, hurry!
-Heidi, heads up. Coming down.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.084
Daddy, hurry!

59:08.962 --> 59:09.920
Help!

59:10.004 --> 59:11.004
Watch out.

59:12.549 --> 59:13.882
Daddy!

59:13.967 --> 59:15.175
l'm coming, baby!

59:24.102 --> 59:25.561
Heidi!

59:47.834 --> 59:48.959
Heidi?

59:53.840 --> 59:55.173
-Daddy!
-Heidi!

59:55.383 --> 59:56.675
Jesus.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.886
How the hell did you get down here, baby?

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:02.848
What the hell?

01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:07.436
This is where the Station Master hid them.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.189
Unbelievable.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.651
How the hell did you find this place, Heidi?

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.236
The girl showed me.

01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.697
ls that the one that you said
was down here with you?

01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:20.782
No.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:33.378
l think something else
is down here, too, Daddy.

01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:35.672
l don't want to be here anymore.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:38.258
That makes two of us.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:43.263
Most Pine Mountain residents know
the story of the Station Master

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:46.350
who helped slaves escape to freedom
as part of the Underground Railroad.

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:49.645
But last night, a young local girl
uncovered a sad, unknown chapter

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.730
in the saga right in her own backyard.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.650
What authorities believe
are the remains of five males...

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.276
...discovered in an underground chamber

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.737
beneath the ruins
of the Station Master's cabin.

01:00:58.946 --> 01:01:01.948
Now, the Station Master,
also known as Jefferson Gordy

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.660
was the great-grandfather
of the late J.S. Gordy,

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:06.119
who died in 1978.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.830
For all the lives that were saved
by the Underground Railroad

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:11.166
there were also many folks
who didn't make it,

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:12.834
who just went missing.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.630
And today's discovery is a tragic reminder
of how dangerous it really was.

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:19.966
In this particular case,
when the Station Master was murdered,

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:22.386
there was no one to let
the slaves out, who were waiting below...

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.679
Will you please turn it off?

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:25.681
...and they probably starved to death
down there.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.307
Reporting live...

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:29.518
You think that's Mama Kay's family?

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.729
They said five males, so l doubt it.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.524
Hey.

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:36.858
What are you doing up?

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.530
l don't want to live here anymore.

01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:43.699
lt's all right now, Heidi.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:45.701
The things that we saw,

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.452
they've moved on.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.579
Their spirits aren't trapped anymore
because of you.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.332
Joyce, please. Spirits?

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.710
Don't you understand
what's happened here, Lisa?

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:56.378
Those people in the chamber
wanted to be found.

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:58.088
That's what this has all been about.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.132
Now they're free,

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:04.136
and there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.304
Mr. Gordy said it's not safe here.

01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:09.725
You've seen Mr. Gordy tonight?

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.977
He said l shouldn't have
gone down in that hole.

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:14.187
He said l let something bad come out.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:17.315
Okay, it is time for you to go back to bed.

01:02:20.361 --> 01:02:22.112
Heidi Wyrick, you follow me right now.

01:02:22.196 --> 01:02:24.239
We can't be here anymore, Mama.

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:27.242
l went in the hole and the bad man saw me.

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:30.495
He knows we're here now and he's coming.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:32.664
What bad man, sweetie?

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.666
The Station Master.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:37.419
-l let him out, Mama.
-Well, Mr. Gordy is wrong,

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:40.255
because you know very well
that the Station Master was a good man.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.090
No, he wasn't.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:45.844
Andy, will you please tell her
that there is nothing to be afraid of?

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:50.724
Mr. Gordy said there was money buried
in the garden, Lisa, and there was.

01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:53.435
He said that

01:02:53.519 --> 01:02:56.188
something terrible happened here. lt did.

01:02:56.689 --> 01:03:00.066
For something in Heidi's mind,
Mr. Gordy is sure as hell right a lot.

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.943
Are you telling me that suddenly
you believe all this?

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:05.322
l believe there was a cave
full of skeletons on our land, Lisa.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:07.783
ls there a...

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:11.912
A "bad man" down there, too?
Hell if l know, but,

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:12.954
l say we pack up the truck

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.540
and we haul our asses outta here
before we find out.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.003
Heidi.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.468
Andy.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.264
l mean, you can't be serious.

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:16.142
We don't have anywhere to go.
l mean, where are we...

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:17.477
Where are we gonna go?

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:21.231
Baby, l...

01:04:21.315 --> 01:04:22.983
l'm sick.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.861
-Heidi and l are sick...
-You're fine.

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.114
Heidi's fine.

01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:31.116
Tell me something.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.995
How the hell did Heidi get down
in that hole?

01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:37.873
Even if she could lift that slab,
which she can't,

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.250
it's a 25-foot drop after that.

01:04:40.334 --> 01:04:41.710
She didn't have a scratch on her.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:44.921
Did you ever think that
maybe Joyce is right?

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:46.423
Crazy Joyce.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.092
That this isn't some kind of disease,

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.012
but l don't know, it's...

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:54.389
A gift?

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:58.393
You try seeing what l see
and you call it a gift.

01:04:58.477 --> 01:04:59.978
l'm just saying maybe it is.

01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:02.814
And I'm done letting you tell our daughter

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.149
that she's sick,

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.943
that she's got some mental disorder.

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:09.237
l love you, l do,

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.488
but...

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.117
l won't

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:16.202
let Heidi live like this.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.662
You understand me?

01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:20.373
-l won't do it.
-Andy, please.

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:24.544
Look, l have seen enough to know
that it ain't up here.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:26.796
lt's out there.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:30.383
Maybe it's trying to tell us something.

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.429
Maybe you should try listening.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.273
lt's sure gonna be lonely here
without you guys.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:48.068
You should leave, too. This is a bad place.

01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:50.779
No, sweetie, it was a bad place.

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:53.531
Now it's not. Because of you.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:58.036
-l'm gonna miss you, baby girl.
-Gonna miss you, too.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.961
Hey, Chief. Come on, buddy.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:49.421
Jump up.

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:53.550
Good boy.

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.185
Hey.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.521
Chief!

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:13.403
Chief! Hey!

01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:15.989
Where the hell's that damn dog going?

01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:18.867
Daddy, we need to leave right now.

01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:22.120
Without your mama?
Yeah, l'm not sure how she'd take that.

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:23.663
lt's all right. Let me go find Chief.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:26.207
Be right back. Stay here and lock the door.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.960
Chief!

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:49.022
Chief! Here, boy!

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:56.696
Heidi.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:12.962
Lisa?

01:08:14.715 --> 01:08:15.882
Hello?

01:08:39.406 --> 01:08:41.323
Why are you here?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.683
Heidi. Heidi!

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:10.435
Heidi!

01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:42.398
Andy.

01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:54.285
Oh, my God.

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:01.709
Heidi!

01:13:03.003 --> 01:13:05.546
Oh, God... No, no!

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:15.681
Heidi!

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:17.475
-Heidi!
-Lisa!

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:19.811
Oh, Andy! Heidi's gone!

01:13:20.437 --> 01:13:22.480
Check Joyce's. Check Joyce's!

01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:25.817
Joyce!

01:13:28.153 --> 01:13:31.155
Heidi!

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:42.458
Damn it!

01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:54.887
Joyce!

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:07.608
Heidi!

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.864
Joyce!

01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:18.536
Come on! Heidi!

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.170
Joyce!

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:28.880
Joyce, Heidi's missing!

01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:32.091
Joyce.

01:14:34.219 --> 01:14:35.219
Joyce!

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.304
Let me in!

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.516
Joyce!

01:14:50.736 --> 01:15:06.501
Oh, my God!

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:26.604
Joyce, Joyce, can you hear me, Joyce?

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:27.980
Joyce?

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.899
Joyce!

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.735
Joyce, please! Heidi's been taken.

01:16:15.529 --> 01:16:17.321
Where is she?

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:18.739
Joyce!

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:23.160
With him.

01:16:23.495 --> 01:16:25.246
"With him"?

01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:26.914
Who's "him"?

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:30.501
Joyce, who's "him"?

01:16:38.343 --> 01:16:40.803
No. Not tonight.

01:16:40.887 --> 01:16:42.263
No.

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.015
Not tonight.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.683
Lisa.

01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:49.270
Don't.

01:16:50.522 --> 01:16:52.231
Where's my little girl?

01:16:54.359 --> 01:16:55.735
They know.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:57.445
Who's "they," Joyce?

01:16:57.529 --> 01:16:58.863
Tell me.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.281
Who's "they"?

01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:09.540
Go.

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:14.086
Okay.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:56.731
Heidi?

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:58.274
Heidi!

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:20.880
Heidi?

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:23.507
Heidi!

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:44.236
It's a trap.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.490
The animals can get in,
but they can't get back out.

01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:49.825
They get weak and starve. Easy pickings.

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:06.634
Then you get them back out through here.

01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:08.469
The back door.

01:21:04.609 --> 01:21:05.985
Oh, God!

01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:11.615
Heidi?

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:29.383
Heidi, baby?

01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:32.094
Are you in here?

01:22:35.992 --> 01:22:39.078
You remember Pastor Wells talking
about the Station Master?

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:45.709
Well, back when he owned all this land,

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:49.046
he was also what's called a taxidermist.

01:23:31.297 --> 01:23:33.132
-Mama?
-Heidi!

01:23:37.762 --> 01:23:39.346
Heidi, are you okay?

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:40.472
Are you okay? l'm here.

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:43.726
lt's okay, just listen to me.
l'm gonna get you out of here. Okay?

01:23:48.064 --> 01:23:49.940
-Mama?
-Okay.

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.446
Mama.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:58.323
Okay.

01:23:58.408 --> 01:24:00.284
Okay, hold on to me. Hold on.

01:24:13.798 --> 01:24:15.758
Help us.

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:20.387
Okay.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:21.972
Help us!

01:24:30.815 --> 01:24:32.483
Can you stand up?

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:33.901
Okay.

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:36.445
Okay. Careful.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:37.863
Okay, put your head down.

01:24:49.667 --> 01:24:51.085
Okay.

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.337
We're gonna climb, okay?
lt's gonna be okay.

01:24:53.838 --> 01:24:55.839
Okay, hold on right there.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.091
Okay?

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.467
You can do it.

01:25:19.864 --> 01:25:21.156
Heidi!

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:22.241
Andy!

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:35.754
Oh, my God.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:28.932
Lisa.

01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:32.603
Listen to me, Lisa.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:34.438
Mama.

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:36.231
You have to let them in.

01:26:36.816 --> 01:26:38.233
Help us.

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:39.818
Let them in.

01:26:39.944 --> 01:26:41.570
You don't listen.

01:26:41.946 --> 01:26:43.780
Did you ever think that
maybe Joyce is right?

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:46.408
Maybe this isn't a disease,
but maybe it's a gift?

01:26:47.493 --> 01:26:49.244
Those people in that chamber
wanted to be found.

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:50.746
That's what this has all been about.

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.040
Now they're free.

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:54.750
Because of you.

01:26:54.834 --> 01:26:56.585
If these pills ain't working,

01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:58.962
we sure as hell shouldn't keep
paying for them.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:00.547
They're working.

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:05.010
Just gets a little tricky
when they wear off, that's all.

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:14.811
Let them in.

01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:43.340
I'll be back for you.

01:27:51.849 --> 01:27:54.935
You know very well that
the Station Master was a good man.

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:58.855
No, he wasn't.

01:28:08.908 --> 01:28:10.367
I love you, Lisa.

01:28:20.878 --> 01:28:22.921
Nell and Levi never arrived.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.798
No one knows what happened to them.

01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:19.746
-Mama!
-Heidi!

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:21.790
Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.792
Are you okay?

01:30:25.795 --> 01:30:28.505
Where's your daddy? Who pulled me out?

01:30:43.187 --> 01:30:44.521
lt's okay.

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:46.815
-lt's okay.
-Heidi!

01:30:46.899 --> 01:30:48.066
Daddy!

01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:52.821
Oh, thank God. Thank God!

01:30:53.364 --> 01:30:55.198
-You all right? You all right?
-Yeah.

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:12.132
Mr. Gordy?

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:43.997
Goddamn it.

01:31:44.081 --> 01:31:46.166
You know the tire's supposed to go
below the branch, right?

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.584
You know what?

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:48.835
l don't wanna hear it.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.837
No, it's all right, Andy. Heidi's gonna love it.

01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:53.673
Every girl wants her own
dirty rubber nest up a tree.

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:57.427
Nobody likes you!

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:02.098
This ain't over.

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:10.315
Do you think Mr. Gordy knew
what his granddaddy did?

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:14.277
Probably why he didn't want anybody
on his property.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:18.573
He wanted the Station Master to be
remembered for the people that he saved,

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:20.617
not the ones he...

01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:22.369
Kept.

01:32:23.412 --> 01:32:25.455
l keep thinking about Mama Kay's family.

01:32:25.998 --> 01:32:29.292
Well, they are in a better place.

01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:32.420
That much l do know.
