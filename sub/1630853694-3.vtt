WEBVTT

00:06.439 --> 00:08.541
WHERE IS
THE OLD MAN ?

00:08.608 --> 00:11.077
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO YOUR FACE ?

00:11.978 --> 00:13.813
HE'S LAUGHING AT ME !

00:15.014 --> 00:17.784
( Cogliostro )
FOR THIS NEWEST
HELL SPAWN

00:17.851 --> 00:21.621
HIS DOMAIN IS THAT
BURNED SKIN

00:21.688 --> 00:25.191
AND THE SCARLET SHROUD
PROTECTING HIM

00:25.258 --> 00:29.562
AND POSSESSING HIM
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.998
( male on phone )
You got a thing
for these psychos, Lisa.

00:32.065 --> 00:34.100
THEY ALL GIVE OFF
THE SAME SCENT...

00:34.167 --> 00:35.101
EVIL.

00:36.269 --> 00:39.072
WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE NSC AND TERRY ?

00:39.139 --> 00:42.642
HE STAYS AWAY
FOR DAYS AT A TIME,
IT'S DRIVING US APART.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.813
CONFIRM CHAPEL
INVOLVEMENT.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.548
CHAPEL IS
JUST A PUPPET.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.784
THE NSC WAS
PULLING THE STRINGS.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.619
I UNDERSTAND THAT
NEW YORK'S FINEST

00:52.685 --> 00:54.254
who are killed
in the line of duty

00:54.320 --> 00:56.423
are given quite
a hero's burial.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.425
THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN
MAKE DECISIONS AT THIS LEVEL

00:58.491 --> 00:59.859
IS JASON WYNN.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.761
YOU'VE DONE WELL,
OFFICER.

01:04.597 --> 01:06.633
( Sam )

NO !

01:51.878 --> 01:53.813
AHH !

02:15.034 --> 02:18.171
WE WEAR MASKS
TO PROJECT IMAGES

02:18.238 --> 02:20.306
THAT AREN'T REALLY
WHO WE ARE.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.481
WHY DO WE HIDE
BEHIND MASKS ?

02:28.548 --> 02:31.184
WHAT ARE WE SO AFRAID
TO SHOW THE WORLD ?

02:31.251 --> 02:34.587
MAYBE WE'RE NEVER REALLY
COMFORTABLE WITH OUR OWN SKIN.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.523
MAYBE WE BELIEVE THAT
PEOPLE WON'T ACCEPT US

02:36.589 --> 02:38.858
FOR WHAT
WE TRULY ARE.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.645
TWITCH,
CAN YOU HEAR ME ?

02:58.711 --> 03:00.547
THIS IS SAM.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.248
LISTEN TO ME,
NOBODY DIES TONIGHT.

03:02.315 --> 03:03.583
YOU HEAR ME ?

03:03.650 --> 03:06.085
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE
IN THIS SHIT-HOLE ALLEY.

03:06.152 --> 03:08.021
BURKE, I SAW !

03:08.087 --> 03:09.822
THE GUY WITH
THE RED CLOAK.

03:09.889 --> 03:12.392
HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE,
SHOT YOUR PARTNER.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.661
I CHASED HIM,
BUT HE JUST VANISHED.

03:14.727 --> 03:16.529
( Sam )
LOOK WHAT
HE DID TO TWITCH.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.932
OH, SWEET JESUS.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.034
( sirens )

03:32.011 --> 03:33.880
I'M GONNA
KILL THAT FUCKER

03:33.947 --> 03:36.416
FOR WHAT HE DID
HERE TO MY PARTNER !

03:36.482 --> 03:37.951
WAIT FOR
BACKUP !

03:38.017 --> 03:39.285
BURKE !

03:39.352 --> 03:41.454
( Sam )
YOU HEAR THAT YOU,
PIECE OF SHIT ?!

03:41.521 --> 03:43.923
I'LL FUCKING
KILL YOU !

04:12.118 --> 04:13.987
( helicopter approaching )

04:35.074 --> 04:37.310
GLAD YOU GUYS
COULD MAKE IT.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.779
YOU'RE
A LITTLE LATE !

04:39.846 --> 04:41.948
SONOFABITCH
IS GONE.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.851
I KNEW
YOU WOULD COME.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.619
THEY'RE SWARMING
THROUGH THE ALLEYS.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.888
I CAN'T GO BACK
'TILL THEY'RE GONE.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.791
THERE'S ALWAYS
SANCTUARY FOR YOU HERE.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.461
WHY DO THEY
HUNT YOU ?

04:55.528 --> 04:57.830
WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE ?

04:59.565 --> 05:01.634
THEY THINK
I KILLED A COP.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.836
I CAN'T HIDE
FROM THEM ANYMORE.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.773
YOU HAVE TO STOP
THE SENSELESS KILLINGS.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.875
THE PEOPLE I KILL
DESERVE TO DIE !

05:08.941 --> 05:11.044
YOU PROJECT YOUR EVIL
ONTO OTHERS

05:11.110 --> 05:12.779
AND THEN KILL THEM,

05:12.845 --> 05:14.847
THINKING YOU'VE
DESTROYED THAT EVIL.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.483
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT
FROM THE OTHER HELL SPAWNS.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.218
AND THEY'RE
ALL DEAD.

05:19.285 --> 05:22.655
IT IS ALL FORETOLD HERE
IN THE BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.558
THAT'S JUST A MUSTY OLD BOOK,
IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

05:25.625 --> 05:29.295
THERE'S ONLY A SINGLE BOOK
LIKE THIS ONE.

05:29.362 --> 05:34.200
WRITTEN A LONG TIME AGO
IN THE TIME OF THE MIDST.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.804
IT CAN HELP YOU BREAK THE CURSE
AND DEFY MALEBOLGIA.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.306
HE MADE ME A PRISONER
INSIDE THIS SHROUD.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.208
I ESCAPED THE SHROUD.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.310
YOU CAN DO THE SAME
AND BE FREE.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.814
IT FIGHTS AGAINST ME,
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.682
YES, YOU CAN.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.851
TO BE MASTER
OF THE SHROUD

05:51.918 --> 05:54.420
YOU MUST BE MASTER
OF YOUR HEART.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.390
MY HEART
IS DEAD.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.759
THAT'S WHAT MALEBOLGIA
WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE.

05:59.826 --> 06:03.863
YES, HE DID CHOOSE A MAN
WHOSE HEART WAS DARK.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.833
BUT, NOW INSIDE YOU
THERE IS SOME GOOD.

06:06.899 --> 06:10.470
MALEBOLGIA IS
THE MIND KILLER

06:10.536 --> 06:14.974
AND HE WILL SEEP IN LIKE
A SICKNESS IF YOU LET HIM.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.043
THE SHROUD
CONTROLS YOUR FLESH.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.846
BUT THERE IS A WAY
TO KEEP IT

06:19.912 --> 06:22.682
FROM CONTROLLING
YOUR MIND AND YOUR HEART.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.817
HOW DO I FIGHT AGAINST
AN ENEMY I CAN'T SEE,

06:24.884 --> 06:26.953
THAT I KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT ?

06:27.019 --> 06:28.821
A PART OF YOU
IS THE ENEMY.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.423
YOU HAVE TO BURY
THE MAN YOU ONCE WERE

06:30.490 --> 06:31.891
BECAUSE HE'S DAMNED.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.960
BECOME A NEW MAN,
A BETTER MAN !

06:34.026 --> 06:36.362
ONLY THEN WILL
THE SHROUD SERVE YOU.

06:36.429 --> 06:37.864
DON'T PREACH
TO ME !

06:37.930 --> 06:42.335
I NEED TO KNOW, CAN THIS THING
GIVE ME MY BODY BACK ?

06:43.402 --> 06:46.639
IT CAN GIVE YOU
ANY FORM YOU CHOOSE.

06:46.706 --> 06:50.376
SO YOU HAVE YOUR FACE BACK,
WHAT THEN ?

06:50.443 --> 06:53.846
I WANT TO SEE MY WIFE
AS I USED TO BE.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.348
A MAN.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.617
I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE
TO TELL HER GOODBYE.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.285
THAT'S ALL I ASK.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.354
THERE IS A COST.

07:05.858 --> 07:08.060
I DON'T
GIVE A DAMN !

07:08.127 --> 07:10.196
I'VE ALREADY
LOST EVERYTHING.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.965
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE TO LOSE.

07:13.032 --> 07:17.136
YOU WILL BE VULNERABLE
IN YOUR HUMAN FORM.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.906
IN TIME YOUR SKIN
WILL DECAY

07:19.972 --> 07:22.875
AND YOU WILL RETURN
TO THE FORM YOU ARE NOW.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.344
ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH
FOR THAT ?

07:25.411 --> 07:28.314
WHATEVER YOU DO,
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.516
SHOW ME,
OLD MAN.

07:35.421 --> 07:38.090
ALLOW THE SHROUD

07:38.157 --> 07:40.193
TO ENVELOP YOU.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.470
HERE YOU GO.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.909
TWITCH,
HEY BUDDY.

08:29.976 --> 08:33.145
YOU GONNA MAKE IT, I TOLD THEM
YOU WERE GONNA BE OKAY.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.783
BACK IN BUSINESS.

08:38.584 --> 08:41.187
I'M SORRY,
WHO ARE YOU ?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.089
IT'S ME TWITCH, SAM.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.891
SAM BURKE,
I'M YOUR PARTNER.

08:48.527 --> 08:50.096
OF COURSE.

08:50.162 --> 08:51.497
MY PARTNER.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.885
STAY OUT OF
THOSE CHOCOLATES

09:12.952 --> 09:16.822
AND GET AN APPLE
LIKE GRANNY TOLD YOU TO.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.591
ALRIGHT,
GRANNY.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.127

09:21.193 --> 09:24.030

I'LL GET IT, GRANNY.

09:24.096 --> 09:27.033
THAT'S ALRIGHT, CHILD,
I'LL GET IT.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.336
WHO COULD
THAT BE ?

09:32.471 --> 09:35.074
YES, CAN
I HELP YOU ?

09:35.141 --> 09:37.143
I'M LOOKING
FOR WANDA BLAKE.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.545
AND WHO IS THIS
THAT'S ASKING ?

09:41.314 --> 09:44.083
JUST AN OLD FRIEND OF HERS
BACK IN TOWN.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.618
WELL, NOW,

09:45.685 --> 09:47.920
I KNOW MOST
OF WANDA'S FRIENDS.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.289
HI, IT'S ME,
CYAN !

09:50.356 --> 09:52.191
I'M SORRY
TO HAVE BOTHERED YOU.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.894
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN
AND WAIT FOR HER ?

09:54.961 --> 09:57.396
NO, I'VE MADE
A MISTAKE.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.165
PLEASE,
DON'T GO.

09:59.231 --> 10:01.334
AT LEAST
NOT YET...

10:01.400 --> 10:02.902
AL.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.804
GRANNY.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.205
WHAT ?

10:06.272 --> 10:09.208
YOU THINK I STILL
WOULDN'T KNOW YOU ?

10:09.275 --> 10:13.913
I VISIT YOUR GRAVE
EVERY SUNDAY TO TALK TO YOU.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.449
AND PRAY FOR YOU.

10:16.515 --> 10:20.786
I PRAYED THAT YOU'D
ANSWER ME IN SOME WAY.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.722
I COULD USE
A FEW PRAYERS.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.958
JUST LAST NIGHT
I HAD A DREAM

10:26.025 --> 10:28.527
THAT YOU WERE IN
A DARKENED CHURCH

10:28.594 --> 10:31.197
LOOKING FOR
THE LORD.

10:31.263 --> 10:34.433
YOU ALWAYS DID
SEE MORE THAN THE OTHERS.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.069
IT<i> IS</i> YOU.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.805
YOU HAVE COME FROM HEAVEN,
HAVEN'T YOU ?

10:39.872 --> 10:42.842
AN ANGEL
TO WATCH OVER US.

10:42.908 --> 10:45.945
GRANNY, I WISH I WAS
THE PERSON YOU WANT ME TO BE.

10:46.012 --> 10:49.048
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD
A GOOD HEART, AL.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.250
YOU JUST NEED
TO FOLLOW IT.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.119
THE BIBLE SAYS...

10:53.185 --> 10:57.156
"IF YOU SEE AND HEAR
WITH YOUR HEART

10:57.223 --> 11:00.793
YOU'LL BE SHOWN
THE MYSTERIES OF HIS KINGDOM."

11:00.860 --> 11:03.796
THE AFTERLIFE IS NOT WHAT
THE GOOD BOOK SAYS, GRANNY.

11:03.863 --> 11:05.998
WHY DON'T
YOU COME INSIDE ?

11:06.065 --> 11:07.967
I WAS WRONG
TO COME.

11:08.034 --> 11:10.403
I WANTED TO SEE WANDA,
I WAS AFRAID.

11:10.469 --> 11:13.272
WHAT COULD
YOU BE AFRAID OF ?

11:13.339 --> 11:16.108
THAT I WOULD
NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.812
NOTHING CAN KEEP
YOU AND WANDA APART.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.849
NOT DEATH,
NOT ANYTHING.

11:23.916 --> 11:27.253
JUST WAIT FOR HER,
WATCH OVER HER.

11:27.319 --> 11:30.356
SHE'LL JOIN YOU
IN HEAVEN ONE DAY.

11:30.423 --> 11:33.059
YOU ALWAYS HAD FAITH,
GRANNY.

11:33.125 --> 11:36.062
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS I'VE COME BACK.

11:36.128 --> 11:39.031
THIS IS MY GRANNY,
SHE CAN'T SEE.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.371
SHE SEES
MORE THAN MOST.

11:46.405 --> 11:50.776
I THINK WANDA KNOWS THAT
YOU ARE STILL WITH HER.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.445
AL ?

11:52.511 --> 11:56.148
THAT'S
THE SAD MAN.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.928
HOW'S
OUR PATIENT ?

12:08.994 --> 12:10.763
YOU JUST JOIN US ?

12:10.830 --> 12:13.199
FEELING OKAY ?

12:13.265 --> 12:17.570
I HAVE
A SEVERE HEADACHE.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.473
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

12:22.641 --> 12:24.143
I'M TWITCH.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.746
I MEAN, WHAT IS THE NAME
ON YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE ?

12:27.813 --> 12:30.616
HE KNOWS HIS OWN NAME, DOC,
DON'T YOU TWITCH ?

12:34.954 --> 12:37.356
MAXIMILLION...

12:37.423 --> 12:40.059
WILLIAMS.

12:40.793 --> 12:43.462
THE BULLET SHATTERED
ON ENTERING YOUR SKULL,

12:43.529 --> 12:45.598
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

12:45.664 --> 12:48.534
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT
WE COULDN'T REMOVE
THE LARGEST FRAGMENT.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.369
IT'S IN A REAL
PRECARIOUS SPOT.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.738
SO, YOU'LL HAVE A LITTLE
HOUSEGUEST FOR A WHILE.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.974
C'MON, DOC, STOP
HOLDING OUR HANDS.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.643
TELL US WHAT
THE DAMAGE IS HERE !

12:57.710 --> 12:59.478
YOU SEE...

12:59.545 --> 13:01.413
HE SUFFERS FROM EDEMA.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.516
UNTIL THE SWELLING
IN HIS BRAIN GOES DOWN,

13:03.582 --> 13:05.751
WE WON'T KNOW
THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.853
I'LL CHECK
BACK LATER.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.422
YEAH, YOU
DO THAT, DOC.

13:10.489 --> 13:14.326
SIR, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE LOST SOME WEIGHT.

13:14.393 --> 13:16.595
YEAH, A LITTLE.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.364
YOU WEREN'T AROUND
TO GET ME DON--

13:18.430 --> 13:21.167
HEY, PARTNER,
YOU REMEMBER ME !

13:21.233 --> 13:24.203
IT'S HARD,
SIR...

13:24.270 --> 13:26.639
MY MEMORY,

13:26.705 --> 13:29.375
IT FEELS SHATTERED.

13:29.441 --> 13:32.711
LIKE A PUZZLE THAT
FELL TO THE FLOOR.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.980
I'M SEARCHING
FOR THE PIECES.

13:35.047 --> 13:38.050
THEY SAID IF YOU EVER DID
WAKE UP, YOU'D BE A VEGGIE.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.352
WE GOT A LOT
OF WORK AHEAD OF US.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.621
YOU JUST NEED
A LOT OF REST.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.690
HELP ME, SAM.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.927
DON'T LET THEM PUT ME AWAY
IN SOME WAREHOUSE.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.729
I WANT TO
GET THIS GUY.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.766
WE'LL GET HIM.

14:04.276 --> 14:05.578
( phone )

14:08.080 --> 14:10.883
( Wynn )
What should
I do with you ?

14:10.950 --> 14:13.953
I SHOT THE BASTARD
POINT-BLANK, WYNN.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.722
Not even the doctors
have figured out
how he pulled through.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.524
YOUR INABILITY
TO DO THE JOB

14:18.591 --> 14:21.193
HAS PUT YOU IN A VERY DIFFICULT
POSITION, CHIEF BANKS.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.896
WE'RE BOTH IN
A DIFFICULT POSITION.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.699
THIS CREATURE
TOLD TWITCH ABOUT<i> YOU.</i>

14:26.765 --> 14:30.102
HE'LL EVENTUALLY PUT
THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.705
WHEN HE DOES,
YOU BE THERE.

14:40.512 --> 14:43.215
HERE HE COMES,
I'LL BE CLOSE BY.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.866
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR WYNN TO STEP WRONG.

15:00.933 --> 15:03.068
IF THIS INFORMATION
IS WHAT YOU SAY IT IS,

15:03.135 --> 15:05.804
WYNN WILL
GO AWAY.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.841
THEN YOUR PROBLEMS
WILL GO AWAY, MR. FITZGERALD.

15:08.907 --> 15:09.975
FORGET ME.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.677
WHAT ABOUT
MY FAMILY ?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.545
MY WIFE
AND LITTLE GIRL.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.582
MR. SULLIVAN, I WANT ASSURANCE
THAT THEY'LL BE SAFE.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.417
I CAN'T
ASSURE THAT.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.019
WHAT ?

15:20.085 --> 15:23.289
THERE'S A CANCER,
MR. FITZGERALD.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.924
A CANCER THAT HAS
SPREAD THROUGH THE NSC

15:25.991 --> 15:27.893
ALL THE WAY
TO THE TOP.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.096
MY JOB IS TO DESTROY
THE ENEMY WITHIN.

15:31.163 --> 15:34.433
WHOEVER THEY ARE,
WHEREVER THEY HIDE.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.281
JUDY, WHAT'S
TAKING SO LONG ?

15:49.348 --> 15:51.617
I WANT THE VICE PRESIDENT
ON THE PHONE<i> NOW.</i>

15:51.684 --> 15:53.585
( on intercom )
Sir, I--

15:53.652 --> 15:55.587
They said
he's not available.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.023
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE'S NOT AVAILABLE ?

15:58.090 --> 16:00.693
HE AND I HAVE THIS
PHONE CALL EVERY DAY.

16:00.759 --> 16:03.329
That's what they
told me, sir, I'm sorry.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.831
( phone )

16:08.834 --> 16:10.469
( clown )
Thought you should know,

16:10.536 --> 16:13.072
I was strolling through
Central Park today

16:13.138 --> 16:16.375
and there were two men
talking on a park bench.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.243
Did you hear me ?

16:18.310 --> 16:19.712
CLEARLY.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.047
I WAS JUST THINKING THAT
A MAGGOT LIKE YOURSELF

16:22.114 --> 16:25.351
WOULDN'T HAVE THE BALLS
TO FUCK WITH ME LIKE YOU ARE.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.854
IF THE TWO MEN ON THE BENCH
WERE NOT A GREAT THREAT TO ME.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.990
SOMETHING I'M SURE
IS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

16:32.057 --> 16:35.060
One man was
Terry Fitzgerald.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.429
AND THE OTHER MAN ?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.631
Vice Chairman
of the NSC,

16:39.698 --> 16:41.767
Richard Sullivan.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.136
The guy who's been
circling over you

16:44.203 --> 16:46.138
like a vulture.

16:46.205 --> 16:49.041
I'LL HAVE TO REPAY
THE FAVOR SOMEDAY.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.743
HEY WYNN,

16:50.809 --> 16:53.212
YOU'RE A
FREE AGENT NOW.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.681
WITH WHAT YOU KNOW,

16:55.748 --> 16:57.850
YOU'VE JUST BECAME

16:57.916 --> 17:00.119
the most
dangerous man

17:00.185 --> 17:03.122
ON EARTH.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.640
YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.609
WHERE'S CYAN ?

17:23.675 --> 17:25.077
SHE'S AT GRANNY'S.

17:25.144 --> 17:26.912
I TOLD YOU
TO BRING HER.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.213
SHE'S SAFE THERE.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.848
I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT
I HEARD IN YOUR VOICE.

17:29.915 --> 17:32.618
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU NEEDED
TO KEEP HER SAFE FROM ME ?

17:32.684 --> 17:34.520
I'M HER DADDY,
REMEMBER ?

17:34.586 --> 17:36.288
LATELY
YOU SCARE ME.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.890
AND YOU'RE
SCARING CYAN.

17:37.956 --> 17:41.393
PACK YOUR BAGS, WE'LL
PICK UP CYAN ON THE WAY.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.694
WHAT'S GOING ON ?!

17:42.761 --> 17:43.996
YOU'VE BEEN
GONE TWO DAYS,

17:44.062 --> 17:45.564
YOU DON'T EVEN TELL ME
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN ?!

17:45.631 --> 17:48.167
BY MORNING JASON WYNN
WILL NO LONGER BE

17:48.233 --> 17:50.169
THE DIRECTOR
OF THE NSC.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.904
HE'LL BE BROUGHT UP
ON CHARGES OF TREASON.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.807
WHEN HE REALIZES I WAS THE ONE
WHO DROPPED THE DIME ON HIM,

17:54.873 --> 17:56.675
HE'LL COME
AFTER ME.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.745
WE CAN'T STAY HERE
ANY LONGER, WANDA.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.380
WE HAVE TO GO.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.782
AND START
ALL OVER.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.652
NO... THERE ARE LAWS
IN THIS COUNTRY--

18:06.718 --> 18:07.853
LAWS ?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.221
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

18:09.288 --> 18:11.723
YOU REALLY BELIEVE BEING
A LAWYER IS GONNA PROTECT US ?

18:11.790 --> 18:13.592
WANDA,
LISTEN TO ME !

18:15.160 --> 18:17.362
WYNN HAS
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE !

18:17.429 --> 18:20.365
WE CAN'T STAY HERE
ANY LONGER.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.470
THIS IS MY HOME.

18:24.536 --> 18:26.371
I WON'T
BE DRIVEN OUT.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.374
YOU'RE RIGHT WANDA,
I'M THE ONE WHO'S THE TARGET.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.244
TERRY, WAIT !
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

18:32.311 --> 18:34.379
IT'S BETTER IF
YOU DON'T KNOW.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.281
TERRY,
PLEASE.

18:36.348 --> 18:37.850
DON'T GO.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.855
( phone )

18:42.921 --> 18:44.790
( Judy )
It's a Chief Banks.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.692
He insists
on talking to you.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.827
I DON'T KNOW
A CHIEF BANKS.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.531
IT'S THE
"NEW YORK TIMES".

18:52.598 --> 18:55.000
THEY'D LIKE A STATEMENT
ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.468
I'M NOT HERE.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.804
JUDY...

18:58.871 --> 19:01.540
HAVE MY CAR PULLED UP
IN BACK.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.484
( male )
WHERE IS HE ?

19:12.551 --> 19:14.987
HE'S OUT OF
THE OFFICE.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.425
( Judy )
HEY !

19:20.492 --> 19:22.427
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING ?

20:06.905 --> 20:08.740
I'M SORRY,
WANDA.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.376
I'M GLAD
YOU CAME BACK.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.148
WHAT IS IT ?

20:16.214 --> 20:17.749
WHAT'S WRONG ?

20:17.816 --> 20:19.151
I DON'T KNOW.

20:19.217 --> 20:23.021
FOR JUST A MOMENT
I THOUGHT I SAW--

20:25.557 --> 20:27.726
I WILL ALWAYS
KEEP YOU SAFE.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.062
I LOVE YOU,
WANDA.

21:06.365 --> 21:08.333
I'M LOOKING
FOR A MAN.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.469
I WONDER IF
YOU COULD HELP ME.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.771
HEY, HOW 'BOUT
ME, BABY ?

21:15.207 --> 21:17.709
HE WEARS
A RED SHROUD.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.278
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
BESIDE HIM

21:20.345 --> 21:23.782
WHO EVER CALLED IT
A SHROUD.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.250
WHERE IS HE ?

21:25.317 --> 21:28.553
WHO IS IT THAT
SEEKS THE SHROUD ?

21:33.325 --> 21:34.893
JADE !

21:34.960 --> 21:37.162
THERE'S STILL
A PRICE...

21:37.229 --> 21:39.097
ON YOUR HEAD,
HELL SPAWN.

21:40.666 --> 21:43.835
YOU WERE THE ONLY
HELL SPAWN TO ESCAPE ME.

21:43.902 --> 21:47.873
AS YOU CAN SEE,
I GAVE UP MY SHROUD.

21:47.939 --> 21:51.710
I LIVE NOW
AS A HUMAN LIVES.

21:51.777 --> 21:54.546
I LIVE IN FEAR.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.494
TELL THE NEW HELL SPAWN
I'M COMING FOR HIM.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.544
TERRY ?

23:00.912 --> 23:02.047
TERRY ?

23:07.586 --> 23:10.021
I KNOW
YOU'RE THERE.

23:10.088 --> 23:13.091
I HAVE NO PLACE
ELSE TO GO.

23:13.158 --> 23:16.228
THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE
WHO HUNTS YOU.

23:16.294 --> 23:18.997
SHE IS
A CELESTIAL WARRIOR.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.432
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

23:20.499 --> 23:22.033
A BOUNTY HUNTER.

23:22.100 --> 23:25.971
SENT BY
THE CELESTIAL MASTERS.

23:26.037 --> 23:30.075
SHE WAS THE IRON MISTRESS
OF GENGHIS KHAN.

23:30.142 --> 23:33.578
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN
A HISTORY LESSON, OLD MAN.

23:33.645 --> 23:35.313
YOU SHOULD BE !

23:35.380 --> 23:39.251
BECAUSE HE ALSO SENT
SOULS TO MALEBOLGIA.

23:39.317 --> 23:40.952
MILLIONS OF THEM !

23:41.019 --> 23:44.422
HE SLAUGHTERED INNOCENT
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

23:51.963 --> 23:53.732
YOU LOOK
A LITTLE SPOOKED.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.101
SHE HUNTED ME
AS WELL.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.336
YOU FEARED
A WOMAN ?

23:58.403 --> 24:01.940
THESE SPAWNS
LONG BEFORE YOU...

24:02.607 --> 24:05.043
THEY THOUGHT
SHE WAS WEAK TOO

24:05.110 --> 24:07.412
BECAUSE SHE
WAS A WOMAN.

24:07.479 --> 24:11.249
I TRIED TO WARN
THE OTHERS ALSO.

24:11.316 --> 24:14.352
THEY DIDN'T
LISTEN EITHER.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.497
THAT'S THE SKULL
OF GENGHIS KHAN !

24:25.564 --> 24:27.165
I'M NOT LIKE HIM.

24:27.232 --> 24:31.536
IS THERE NO BLOOD ON
YOUR HANDS, HELL SPAWN ?

24:31.603 --> 24:34.406
HEAVEN HAS SENT
THEIR BOUNTY HUNTER,

24:34.472 --> 24:37.676
AND NOW SHE
WANTS YOUR HEAD.

24:37.742 --> 24:39.678
THEN LET HER COME.
