WEBVTT

00:07.680 --> 00:09.760
Grief is slippery.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.800
It comes at us in many disguises.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.320
For instance,
when we experience a loss,

00:16.360 --> 00:18.800
it feels a little bit like a betrayal.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.920
Would you agree, Amandine?

00:22.640 --> 00:23.640
A betrayal?

00:23.720 --> 00:24.760
Uh…

00:28.400 --> 00:29.760
- Hmm…
- Jamie?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.760
Would you say
you feel a little bit betrayed?

00:40.200 --> 00:41.240
Sorry.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.920
I'm so, so sorry.
I have to… I have to get this.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm so sorry.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.040
Hey, mate.
Hey, how did you get on?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.320
D'you get the truffles?

00:54.240 --> 00:55.240
Savinis?

00:56.520 --> 00:58.360
Okay. Just keep trying.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.840
All right. Best you can.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.400
Yeah. Brigsie, I gotta go.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.400
Okay. See you, mate. Bye. Bye.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.520
I'm so sorry.
What were you saying?

01:17.360 --> 01:20.480
I'm just under
a bit of pressure at work at the minute.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.920
You know, we open tonight
and the rooms aren't ready.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.960
There's mistakes
all over the a la carte menu.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.680
We're trying to find
these particular truffles.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.160
- They're called Savinis.
- So this isn't a priority for you?

01:32.240 --> 01:33.600
Of course, it is.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.760
May I ask you a question, Jamie?

01:36.960 --> 01:39.720
Do you sometimes worry
you're not good enough for Amandine?

01:47.240 --> 01:49.760
What time
did you get home from the concert?

01:49.840 --> 01:51.560
It was around 9:30.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.000
- And the babysitter was here?
- Yes. Rachel.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.040
So I paid her

01:56.480 --> 01:59.200
and then I went through there
to work on the dessert menu.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.360
I'm a chef.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.320
I'm actually opening
my first restaurant tonight.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.520
So, yeah, I was through there,
in the kitchen.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.160
And you didn't hear anything?

02:09.280 --> 02:10.800
I was wearing headphones.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.600
Whenever I work on my menus,

02:12.720 --> 02:14.280
I always listen to music.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.680
- How much was it worth?
- The violin or the Xbox?

02:19.360 --> 02:21.160
Sorry. That's…

02:21.280 --> 02:23.960
I'm a little bit shook up,
to be honest.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.600
- We've never been robbed before.
- It's not a robbery.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.080
Sorry?

02:28.160 --> 02:30.800
It's not a robbery.
It's a burglary.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.440
Right.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.400
It's a good workhorse, basic.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.280
It's not a patch
on the Rastelli, obviously,

02:41.360 --> 02:43.040
but it's a solid tool.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.640
It's our bestseller.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.560
How much is… How much is it?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.520
Well, that particular one…

02:51.240 --> 02:53.200
Thank you so, so much.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.960
What, so they just smashed
the window and took it?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.120
And the Xbox.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.560
Ammy says
there was blood on the pane.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.360
Maybe, you know,
the police can get a DNA match for that.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.760
Firstly, I don't think
the Met keep the DNA samples

03:03.840 --> 03:05.320
of all the window-breakers
around London.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.560
And, secondly, it's not Ammy.
It's never been Ammy.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.880
It's Amandine.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.000
Taxi!

03:10.080 --> 03:13.040
Listen, it's going to be all right, okay?

03:13.120 --> 03:15.040
- Uh-hmm.
- We're here for you.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.400
Thanks.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.120
Thank you for today.
It's been a great help. Thank you.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.320
You cut yourself.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.120
What?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.240
Plaster on your hand.
You cut yourself.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.320
I'm a chef, mate, yeah?

03:30.400 --> 03:32.400
Look at that. Look at that.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.160
Look at that.
We cut ourselves all the time, okay?

03:36.240 --> 03:38.080
Yeah, well, call today a favour, yeah?

03:38.160 --> 03:40.640
Ammy, I'll see you at the opening tonight.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.080
Take us to the Strand please, mate.
Thank you.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.120
- It's a sign.
- What is?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.760
- The robbery.
- It's a burglary.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.200
I mean, who knew it was there?
Someone breaks in and takes a violin.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.000
- And the Xbox.
- Fuck the Xbox!

03:56.080 --> 03:59.280
You care about a fucking Xbox?
What's wrong with you?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.760
- You know, stop the cab.
- What do you mean stop the cab? What?

04:01.840 --> 04:03.320
- Are you… I'm running late.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.640
Amandine, I don't have time.
Where are you going now?

04:05.720 --> 04:07.960
I don't want this fucking
cheap fucking piece of shit.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.880
Hey. It's a solid tool.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.560
- Where are you going?
- Just go. Go. Go.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.040
- Now, wait, Amandine. Wait.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.120
Fuck!

04:20.720 --> 04:21.880
Fucking hell.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.880
Mrs. Wilson.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.640
Nothing to report?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.640
Sorry. What?

04:32.720 --> 04:33.720
Stack.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.320
Right. Of course. No, no, no.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.240
Did it, um, I dunno… did it get…

04:44.160 --> 04:45.600
a good burial?

04:45.680 --> 04:47.200
Burial?

04:47.240 --> 04:49.360
Him's dog food.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.360
I picked him up.
I ground him up.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.320
Feed him to the hounds.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.360
Well, best be off.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.120
Yeah, I'm sorry, mate.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.920
- I know they were the ones you wanted.
- Forget the Savinis, okay?

05:23.040 --> 05:26.360
Just send someone to Harrods
and just get the best ones you can.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.320
And call an engineer about the extractor.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.800
All right.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.200
For fuck's sake.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.920
- Do you play?
- Sorry?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.080
- The violin?
- Oh. What? This? No.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.080
This is… No. This is my Tommy gun.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.640
You know,
just in case this all turns nasty.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.800
- It's…
- What's a Orecchiette Tartufate?

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
Oh, orecchiette.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.840
It means… in Italian,
it means little ear.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.920
It's a Southern Italian durum wheat,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.680
eggless pasta
tossed with cremini mushrooms,

05:54.760 --> 05:56.800
asparagus, Parmigiano-Reggiano,

05:56.880 --> 06:01.680
and finished with truffle oil,
truffle cream, and shaved truffles.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.280
Oh, Sherry to mouth,
please stop watering

06:04.360 --> 06:05.600
- Mark and I went

06:05.680 --> 06:08.400
on this truffle hunt in Tuscany last year.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.080
They're not Savinis, are they?

06:10.160 --> 06:13.680
- Savinis are the god of truffles.
- Sounds amazing.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.360
Ten points for Mrs. Claire.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.720
Um, so the business accounts?

06:19.800 --> 06:21.720
- Yes.
- They're rather low.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.280
Well, you know,
Savinis aren't cheap.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.080
Brigsie, the truffles,
they've got to be Savinis, all right?

06:28.160 --> 06:30.560
We have to… Taxi!
Call everyone, okay?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.880
Just call around.
Call everyone you know. All right.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.840
Okay. Hey, mate.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.080
Ow! Mummy!

06:42.760 --> 06:43.840
Greta?

06:44.360 --> 06:47.320
- What's the matter, darling?
- There's something in my foot.

06:47.400 --> 06:51.680
What is it? Let's see.
Oh. Oh, that looks painful.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.840
Okay. Okay. Let's go take care of it.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.880
Come on. Oh.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.400
- Ow.
- There.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.760
Hmm.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.360
Above all, Coco longed to be free.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.240
Free from the responsibilities
that dragged other women down,

08:02.320 --> 08:06.520
the drudgery of motherhood,
the day-to-day loveless tedium.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.120
Coco said that a girl
should only be two things,

08:09.200 --> 08:11.560
who and what she wants.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.800
Lue?

08:18.840 --> 08:19.920
What?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.360
What's wrong?
What's happened?

08:21.440 --> 08:22.680
No, nothing's wrong.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.280
Nothing's happened.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.040
It's just…

08:28.680 --> 08:32.280
The last time I got back,
you weren't there.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.440
Oh.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.880
Yeah. I went for a walk, so.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.600
Yeah, but the kids were on their own.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.040
They were asleep and I locked up.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.760
Yeah, but they were alone.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.160
- Can I get you some snacks?

08:53.640 --> 08:56.640
- Um, no. We're saving ourselves…
- Can I get a Guinness please?

09:03.320 --> 09:05.640
Mmm. They're amazing.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.280
They're not Savinis but…

09:07.360 --> 09:08.760
I know they're not.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.240
It's just that it says
Savinis on the menu.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.120
- Just use these.
- Yeah?

09:19.200 --> 09:20.200
Um…

09:20.280 --> 09:21.880
No one will know.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.520
- Yeah.
- They're the Savinis.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.040
- These are the Savinis.
- Now.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.160
On it.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.160
Okay.

09:34.040 --> 09:38.480
Okay. And Becks,
put Vogue on table eight, okay?

09:38.520 --> 09:41.720
And then the Times
and Money Fair on seven and nine.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.880
And then tables 14, 17,
and 16. That's dirty.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.400
So why did you marry him?

09:49.480 --> 09:52.000
- It doesn't make sense.
- Why not?

09:52.080 --> 09:56.440
Well, I don't know him,
but you're amazing.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.840
You could have anyone.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.360
And then as soon as they're ready,
straight out. Just… Okay?

10:08.440 --> 10:09.640
- Clive.
- Jamie.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.520
Maggie. Welcome.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.120
- What's good, Buckingham?
- Nothing. Genuinely.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.400
Absolutely nothing.
Though the kebab shop three doors down?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.120
Phenomenal.
Bless you for being here.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.880
Ah, Sherry, Claire, how are you?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.120
I hear you've got
Tuscan truffles, Savinis no less.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.240
Yeah. Well, you let me know
how you get on, all right?

10:27.320 --> 10:28.280
Thank you for everything.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.640
Mum. Bless you.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.960
Dad.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.640
- Thanks for being here, buddy.
- Mate. Smash it.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.880
- Right.
- Thanks for making the effort, all right.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.480
- You? Look at you.
- You.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.000
- You, I absolutely…
- Good luck, Jamie.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.960
Oh, we're gonna need it.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.440
Daniel, hey. How are you?
Nice to see you.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.600
- Who's this?
- J-Dog, this is

10:50.640 --> 10:52.400
my beautiful fiancée, Bree.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.160
Bree, this is our maestro, Jamie.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.880
- This is so exciting.
- Is it? Not for me.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.440
Look at that. Actual shaking.
You want a quick tip, Bree?

11:00.520 --> 11:02.520
Go for the rack of lamb, provincial leeks.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.880
Promise you'll love it.
Dan, would I be able to talk to you

11:04.960 --> 11:06.840
just for a couple of minutes?
Is that okay?

11:06.920 --> 11:08.480
- Really quick. Apologies. Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.400
- Hey, mate.
- 'Sup.

11:12.200 --> 11:17.040
Look, I just wanna say I'm sorry
if I got a bit mincy this morning.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.080
I didn't… look, and thank you.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.840
Thank you for everything you've done
for Amandine these past couple of weeks.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.640
From the bottom of my heart,
I mean it. Thank you.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.120
You know, I worked in a kitchen once.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.400
Gapierre Hotel in Hatfield,

11:30.480 --> 11:33.600
and I remember that
when someone cuts themselves,

11:33.680 --> 11:35.240
the plasters are always blue.

11:36.880 --> 11:37.960
What?

11:38.840 --> 11:40.560
In case it falls in the food.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.600
See, they are very few blue foods.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.640
And I Googled it.

11:45.720 --> 11:49.000
Not only am I right,
it turns out it's the law.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.920
Food Safety Act 1990.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.640
Shock it to 'em, J-Dog.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.280
Ah, Fabrice.
I can't hear anything.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.760
Jean Claude. Welcome. Welcome.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.480
Bless you for coming.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.640
Ah, Beatrice, you look extraordinary.

12:27.720 --> 12:28.960
Jamie.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.920
I hear there's been a burglary.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.320
Uh, yes, unfortunately. Yeah.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.920
- You were there?
- I was.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.800
- And you did nothing?
- Mama!

12:36.880 --> 12:39.720
No. Uh, no, please.
You are absolutely right, Beatrice.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.400
You are. I was there.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.600
I was there and I cannot apologise enough.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.840
I should have done more.
I should have done better.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.600
I should have done much,
much better.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.800
No. No. Don't listen to her.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.360
Fucking kill it, Jamie.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.800
Push service. I need focus here.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.040
- Fuck me.
- It's the extractor.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.960
Yeah. You know what they say,
if you can't stand the heat, wait.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.000
- All right. Go, go, go.
- Not yet.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.320
Go, go, go, go, go.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.640
Wait. You're sweating
all over the plates. Put it back.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.120
- Sorry, Chef.
- Go outside. Get some air.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.920
- Becks, find someone else.
- On it.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.600
Where's Becks?

13:27.680 --> 13:29.440
- I fucking said to get this done.
- I know.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.760
- Get it fucking fixed.
- What's wrong?

13:39.840 --> 13:41.400
Nothing. I don't see nothing.
Go back down.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.120
- The handle's broken.
- I don't know.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.520
- We can get one from a car.
- Not too big. Hold that.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.560
Here you go.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.720
Okay.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.640
Okay.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.320
Just a sec.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.520
Now.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.080
That should buy you about an hour.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.280
Thanks.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.000
Oh, by the way, the clams
are fucking awesome.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.360
- They're sea snails, so…
- Oh. See?

14:09.440 --> 14:11.400
What do I know?
See you down there.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.440
Where have you been?

14:18.520 --> 14:19.760
On the roof.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.480
You… Your stockings have gone.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.440
Oh, yeah.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.960
I was fucking the chef, so…

14:28.040 --> 14:31.480
- Oh, were you?
- Uh-hmm. French. Really nice cock.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.840
- On the roof?
- Uh-hmm.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.600
Order up, Gio.
One pineapple, one panna cotta,

14:38.680 --> 14:40.000
one shortbread.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.800
The Savinis, the absolute god of truffles.

14:43.880 --> 14:44.760
Mmm.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.560
Don't stop. Don't stop.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.440
Don't stop.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.400
Fuck me, you moppet.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.960
What are you doing? Don't stop.
Why are you stopping?

15:02.240 --> 15:04.240
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.960
What? Nothing.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.520
Did you… you call me a moppet?

15:10.600 --> 15:11.800
No, I didn't.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.400
I didn't.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.480
No. I heard you just say,
"Fuck me, you moppet."

15:18.320 --> 15:20.240
- I didn't.
- You did.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.040
- Why moppet?
- This is ridiculous.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.920
No. Answer the question.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
- Why did you call me a moppet?
- All right. Okay.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.720
- Oh, I see.
- It slipped out.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.920
- So you did.
- For fuck's sake, Jeff.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.120
I'm a moppet. We're having sex
and you're… you're thinking moppet.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.360
- You call me names.
- When?

15:38.440 --> 15:40.960
Uh, last Christmas.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.920
Once, by our bedroom,
you called me a bitch.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.360
- What? That's different.
- How is it different?

15:45.440 --> 15:47.320
Is that what you think of me, a moppet?

15:48.640 --> 15:50.600
- You're being a moppet right now.
- Oh, I don't believe this.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.000
Well, believe it.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.480
I'm a moppet?

15:58.120 --> 16:00.040
Fucking moppet?

16:08.960 --> 16:12.120
This is the last shake, guys.
It's so good. We're so close.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.720
- Amazing tonight.
- Yes.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.160
- Fantastic work.
- This is it.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.640
So close.
Everyone's earned a drink.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.080
Whoo!

16:52.480 --> 16:54.040
There is…

16:54.120 --> 16:57.840
one knows not
what sweet mystery about the sea.

16:59.680 --> 17:05.120
Whose gently awful stirring seem
to speak of some hidden soul beneath.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.200
This restaurant is your dream.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.800
And you named it after me.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.440
I will never forget it.

17:16.880 --> 17:17.960
Thanks.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.080
Amandine.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.320
And that is a wrap.
Congratulations, boss.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.880
Everyone's waiting.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.640
The chef is on his way, guys.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.320
Congratulations.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.920
Stop. Please.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.680
Sit down. Sit down, please.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.800
When I was four…

17:56.880 --> 17:58.520
I'm very sorry.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.800
…I made my mum, right there…

18:00.920 --> 18:02.920
I made her tea and toast in bed.

18:04.240 --> 18:08.240
And the tea was cold,
mostly milk, and the toast was burnt.

18:09.560 --> 18:13.880
But she said it was the best tea
and toast that she had ever had.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.240
And so, mum,
this is all your fault. This is.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.800
But the photo you can see there
behind the bar,

18:23.920 --> 18:26.800
- the picture, that's not my mum.
- Oh, thank God.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.800
Uh, that…

18:30.720 --> 18:32.200
That is Amandine.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.280
My wife.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.200
See, there's-- there's two Amandines

18:40.280 --> 18:45.080
and, uh… both are demanding.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.720
Both require great,

18:50.040 --> 18:52.080
great care and attention.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.440
Both are…

19:08.160 --> 19:10.440
Amandine said to me
the other day…

19:11.320 --> 19:14.400
just the other day, didn't you,
Amandine said, um…

19:16.480 --> 19:21.080
Amandine said that life
is about finding your passion.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.560
And I believe that. I do.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.680
I believe that.
And I met…

19:27.560 --> 19:29.160
I met someone recently.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.200
Dave.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.160
Dave's an accountant

19:43.440 --> 19:45.080
but his passion is salsa.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.280
And then there's Jason.

19:54.320 --> 20:00.000
Jason is a commercial's…
Jason was a commercial's director

20:00.800 --> 20:03.320
and he loved motorbikes.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.000
And then there's Paul.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.560
I don't know who Paul is.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.320
Amandine does.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.520
See, what these three men don't know

20:23.560 --> 20:26.320
is they share another passion.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.760
Because the difference
between Amandine the restaurant

20:28.800 --> 20:30.240
and Amandine my wife

20:30.320 --> 20:31.720
is that Amandine the restaurant

20:31.800 --> 20:34.320
isn't fucking three other men
behind my back.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.800
I love you, my darling.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.000
This is all for you.
