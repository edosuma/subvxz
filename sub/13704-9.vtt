WEBVTT

00:53.486 --> 00:55.455
Let's get her to a hospital.
The car's over there.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.434
Don't go.

01:42.135 --> 01:46.106
My cell phone passcode
is your date of birth, 0822.

01:48.007 --> 01:50.276
Ma'am, this is JB.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.045
Please don't be alarmed.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.119
Are you awake?

02:00.987 --> 02:02.255
Do you know where you are?

02:06.092 --> 02:07.327
Calm down.

02:09.996 --> 02:10.830
Why are you here?

02:11.431 --> 02:13.133
Didn't you go to see Hae-seong?

02:13.766 --> 02:16.636
Yes, but I haven't seen her yet.

02:19.706 --> 02:20.540
Didn't you...

02:21.374 --> 02:23.076
hate me?

02:23.643 --> 02:25.311
You have such a way with words.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.048
If I hated you, would I have
carried you to the hospital?

02:30.083 --> 02:33.453
This is the second time.
My back isn't your private taxi, you know.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.392
Thank goodness for JB.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.094
He drove us here.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.571
I called your mom--

02:52.772 --> 02:54.207
Who are you to call my mom?

02:54.974 --> 02:56.609
-I also told Mr. Lee--
-Get out.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.746
I don't need you to look out for me.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.849
Aren't you occupied enough
with Hae-seong alone?

03:06.352 --> 03:07.320
Didn't you hear me?

03:07.987 --> 03:09.322
Get out of here!

03:20.266 --> 03:21.734
But he seemed really concerned.

03:25.271 --> 03:26.272
You didn't have to...

03:28.441 --> 03:29.275
Hey.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.911
Nurse! Over here!

03:33.446 --> 03:34.347
Over here!

03:46.359 --> 03:47.894
Look at how Rian came out.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.132
THE MOST PHOTOGENIC PERSON OF THE MONTH

03:56.569 --> 03:58.771
So Rian is this month's
most photogenic person.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.242
She's following in Hae-seong's footsteps.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.078
But look at her.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.479
I feel sorry for her.

04:06.746 --> 04:07.580
Don't you think?

04:08.181 --> 04:10.416
Don't you think this might end up
affecting us as well?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.720
HershE's image will suffer.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.858
Why didn't you guys go with Rian?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.594
Mr. Lee never told us about it.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.964
There's no way Rian
would go to that gig willingly.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.268
Why and how did Rian end up there?

04:30.536 --> 04:31.638
Should we look into it?

04:32.138 --> 04:34.707
I bet Mr. Lee forced her.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.977
Rian's been uncooperative lately--

04:39.045 --> 04:40.413
Watch what you say.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.315
-Look at that.
-I feel bad for her.

04:42.482 --> 04:43.683
Let's just wait and see.

04:52.592 --> 04:53.559
Are you awake?

04:57.830 --> 04:59.299
How long have I been asleep?

04:59.666 --> 05:02.035
I didn't know teen idols
snore and grind their teeth.

05:03.102 --> 05:03.936
It's quite fascinating.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.838
-I snored?
-Yes.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.575
It's probably
because I was sleep-deprived.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.211
I normally don't snore.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.347
I'm kidding.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.149
You slept like a baby.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.852
Your mom said that she would be here soon.

05:21.921 --> 05:22.989
That's unnecessary.

05:27.827 --> 05:31.230
I don't look too sick, do I?

05:31.664 --> 05:33.700
Why does it matter? She's your mom.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.036
That's because

05:38.371 --> 05:41.774
my mom's the biggest nagger in the world.

05:47.747 --> 05:48.815
Rian!

05:50.049 --> 05:50.917
Hello.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.187
What are you doing here?

05:54.253 --> 05:55.688
Are you okay? Are you sick?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.825
It's no big deal.
You didn't have to come all this way.

05:58.891 --> 06:02.295
I don't believe this.
What did the doctor say?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.629
Is it bad?

06:03.863 --> 06:06.032
Hold your horses. One question at a time.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.802
-What did the doctor say?
-I just need to rest.

06:10.737 --> 06:11.604
Oh, my goodness.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.108
Look at how skinny you are.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.944
Have you been taking
the supplements I got you?

06:18.010 --> 06:18.945
Have you been eating?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.980
You've been skipping meals again,
haven't you?

06:22.148 --> 06:24.751
I told you to eat well
and take it easy, didn't I?

06:24.817 --> 06:25.718
Mom.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.721
I got it.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.595
Let's get you to a hospital in Seoul.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.597
They said I was fine.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.500
Do as I say. I'll talk to Mr. Lee.

06:42.468 --> 06:46.272
You should stay at a hospital for a while
to rest and recharge yourself.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.574
I'll take care of everything.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.346
I've had it.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.384
I can't let Rian be a singer any longer.

07:00.052 --> 07:04.557
Please calm down,
so we can discuss this misunderstanding.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.527
Rian passed out from shock.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.129
Wasn't it an accident?

07:10.196 --> 07:11.330
An accident?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.099
Don't you know whose fault this is?

07:15.468 --> 07:16.335
Fine.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.105
If you want to make excuses, go ahead.
Let's hear it.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.408
Make excuses?

07:23.042 --> 07:24.677
Are you saying that it was my fault?

07:24.844 --> 07:26.345
Then whose fault was it?

07:30.416 --> 07:32.785
If you really want me to get down to it,

07:33.586 --> 07:36.989
don't you think it's Rian's fault
for not singing on stage?

07:37.056 --> 07:38.891
How could she sing at a venue like that?

07:38.958 --> 07:42.261
She had to go all the way there
without a manager or a van.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.030
I asked you to get her gigs,

07:44.096 --> 07:46.666
not send her into the provinces
for lousy town fairs.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.401
No matter how lousy the gig,

07:48.468 --> 07:51.103
singers must deliver
when they're on stage.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.373
It's not like a drunkard
threw a bottle at her.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.043
It was just a soccer ball.

07:58.344 --> 08:01.214
She can't be a singer
with that kind of an attitude.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.783
She wanted to act.
It was you who forced her to be a singer.

08:06.219 --> 08:10.022
You should let Rian
focus on her acting from now on.

08:11.357 --> 08:14.360
Before anything else,
get her out of that stupid audition.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.630
As overseer of the audition,
may I offer my two cents?

08:18.731 --> 08:19.565
Excuse me?

08:19.632 --> 08:21.567
Given Rian's current attitude,

08:22.468 --> 08:24.704
we'll be cutting her out
of the audition ourselves.

08:25.838 --> 08:26.739
What did you say?

08:28.107 --> 08:29.575
You seem to be mistaken.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.311
Without her singing career,

08:33.179 --> 08:34.714
Rian could never break into acting.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.962
Is Rian okay?

09:23.863 --> 09:26.132
She just needs to rest.

09:28.801 --> 09:29.902
Did you come here...

09:31.137 --> 09:32.605
to see me?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.476
Why did you come all the way here?

09:41.380 --> 09:42.782
You may not know this,

09:44.183 --> 09:46.118
but during the radio show,

09:46.819 --> 09:48.287
Rian sang your song.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.257
I know.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.661
I heard it on the radio.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.098
That was not we planned to do,

09:59.699 --> 10:01.100
but it ended up like that.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.635
It's all my fault.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.471
You don't have to apologize.

10:06.672 --> 10:11.978
No one would've known about my song
if not for you guys.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.580
That's not true. Everyone knows.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.284
You and I, and our classmates all know.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.054
Everyone's waiting for you.

10:22.855 --> 10:23.856
You have to come back.

10:29.028 --> 10:31.163
Thanks for coming all this way,

10:32.598 --> 10:33.432
but...

10:35.067 --> 10:36.168
I can't go back.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.505
I'm not going back.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.375
Hae-seong.

10:42.775 --> 10:43.843
For me,

10:44.777 --> 10:47.880
music will always be
like a one-sided love affair.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.718
My love for music is unrequited.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.390
Rian must be up. You should go back in.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.147
He's so good, isn't he?

12:09.161 --> 12:10.930
How can they be so bad?

12:12.965 --> 12:14.767
We're doomed.

12:15.601 --> 12:16.836
What are you kids up to?

12:17.870 --> 12:19.238
Oh, hello.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.941
We think the theme of the mission
is about the singer Rain,

12:22.007 --> 12:24.009
so we'll perform his song, "Rainism."

12:24.076 --> 12:26.078
We look just like Rain, right?

12:26.312 --> 12:27.346
I didn't know

12:28.547 --> 12:31.350
that Rain was known
for his jiggling belly moves.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.860
Are you mad at the world?
Look at you chewing gum.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.995
How can you chew gum while dancing?

12:43.562 --> 12:44.764
Seriously.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.932
What are you doing?

12:47.233 --> 12:49.335
Who's this?

12:49.401 --> 12:51.504
Our English teacher.

12:52.638 --> 12:53.672
He's the English teacher?

12:55.307 --> 12:56.275
Come with me.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.484
They're so good.

13:40.419 --> 13:41.487
We're done for.

13:42.254 --> 13:43.556
They are good.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.026
The audition is right around the corner.

13:47.459 --> 13:50.830
It's not just the students'
but also your responsibility

13:50.896 --> 13:52.731
to showcase the best
possible performances.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.301
Please don't forget that.
Meeting adjourned.

14:08.647 --> 14:09.882
Do you have something to say to me?

14:11.450 --> 14:13.485
Well...

14:15.554 --> 14:17.857
It was a reckless decision on my part.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.058
Pardon?

14:19.859 --> 14:22.328
The playing field is uneven.

14:22.394 --> 14:25.264
How can we pit my students,
who are pure amateurs,

14:25.331 --> 14:27.533
against established teen idols?

14:30.302 --> 14:33.105
For this "Bi" mission,

14:34.106 --> 14:37.443
couldn't you give me
just a little tiny hint

14:37.509 --> 14:38.944
on what you're looking for?

14:39.278 --> 14:43.315
In the game of Go, the better player
gives the worse player an advantage.

14:43.549 --> 14:47.786
So if you could help us just a little bit,

14:48.020 --> 14:49.955
the competition would be fairer.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.024
"Fairer"?

14:52.791 --> 14:53.626
Yes.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.394
Do athletes of different builds

14:55.461 --> 14:58.030
start a race at different starting lines
at the Olympics?

14:59.598 --> 15:01.166
Why are there rules?

15:02.034 --> 15:04.937
It's so that everyone competes
under the same conditions.

15:05.704 --> 15:08.040
Is this how you've been teaching
your students all along?

15:09.041 --> 15:13.779
Have you taught them to whine
and ask for special handicaps?

15:14.546 --> 15:17.850
-I was just asking for a little hint--
-Bi.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.418
That's the hint.

15:19.952 --> 15:20.786
Bi.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.121
What else do you want?

15:23.422 --> 15:26.225
Do you know the kind of people
I consider the most pathetic?

15:27.826 --> 15:30.195
Those who don't put in hard work
and try to find shortcuts.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.831
If you're good enough
for the national finals,

15:32.898 --> 15:34.033
that's where you'll get to.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.169
But you shouldn't insist
on participating in the Olympics.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.591
You did seem more driven
than I thought you were cut out for.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.861
But was cheating the best thing
you could think of?

16:04.029 --> 16:05.698
Don't you have a sense of shame
as an educator?

16:06.065 --> 16:10.803
You're the one who will be humiliated
at the end of the audition.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.908
There are some cases
where drive and hard work are not enough.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.011
Teaching is ultimately

16:19.078 --> 16:22.514
the act of helping students
realize their potential.

16:23.949 --> 16:27.586
But you won't get water
by digging into an already dried-up earth.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.288
You'll only end up with a ditch.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.825
Are you implying that my students
don't stand a chance?

16:32.891 --> 16:34.526
Do you think they do?

16:38.597 --> 16:39.565
This just occurred to me.

16:40.899 --> 16:43.502
Doesn't Shin Hae-seong,
the girl who transferred,

16:44.303 --> 16:45.537
remind you of someone?

16:46.872 --> 16:50.909
Doesn't she remind you
of this vocal teacher who can't sing?

16:51.210 --> 16:54.480
Someone born untalented,
who only causes people grief.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.850
It's not too late to replace her
with someone else.

16:57.916 --> 17:00.486
All the more reason for me
not to give up on Hae-seong.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.155
She's already gone.
Why would she come back?

17:03.222 --> 17:04.323
She will be back.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.558
She will definitely be back.

17:08.027 --> 17:08.861
Gosh.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.634
HAE-SEONG, ME, JB

17:24.777 --> 17:25.911
Hello?

17:26.178 --> 17:29.515
Ms. Shin Hae-seong?
I'm Yenny of Wonder Girls.

17:31.283 --> 17:35.254
If you're in Wonder Girls,
I'm in Girls' Generation.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.390
Hey!

17:38.690 --> 17:40.726
I told you not to answer
my phone, didn't I?

17:47.699 --> 17:49.535
You must've thought it was a prank.

17:49.601 --> 17:52.538
-I am Yenny of Wonder Girls.
-Let me see that.

17:52.604 --> 17:56.008
I would like to put your song
"Hello to Myself" on my solo album.

17:56.341 --> 17:57.342
Please call me back.

17:58.143 --> 18:02.748
Wow, it really was Yenny of Wonder Girls.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.084
I need her autograph.

18:05.617 --> 18:06.652
Let's call her back.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.889
Give it to me.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.724
Give it!

18:14.326 --> 18:15.227
-That's strange.
-Come on!

18:15.294 --> 18:17.863
-How did she know I wrote the song?
-Gosh.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.798
Come on.

18:20.499 --> 18:21.900
Who cares how she found out?

18:21.967 --> 18:25.003
You're a pro songwriter,
and that's all that matters.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.406
You've hit the big time!

18:27.840 --> 18:30.843
It really was Yenny. This is incredible!

18:31.343 --> 18:33.045
I have to brag to my friends.

18:33.745 --> 18:36.482
Give it to me! Let's call her back.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.484
-Songwriter?
-Come on.

18:38.550 --> 18:43.021
-Have I really become a songwriter?
-Let me see that.

18:43.388 --> 18:45.023
Come on.

18:45.924 --> 18:48.927
Give it to me.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.698
-We're late. Run.
-We're late again.

18:52.764 --> 18:54.366
-You shouldn't be late for class.
-We're late.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.868
Get moving there.

18:55.934 --> 18:56.902
Jin Yu-jin.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.205
I need to talk to you.

19:01.573 --> 19:02.474
We're late for school.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.543
Run. Hurry up.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.245
Hey.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.082
Did you get to see Shin Hae-seong?

19:11.250 --> 19:12.217
Is she coming back?

19:12.784 --> 19:15.587
I told her that we're waiting for her,
so she will come back before the audition.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.089
How can you be so sure?

19:17.456 --> 19:20.893
You know, I'm quite irresistible.
It's like she has a big crush on me.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.364
Shin Hae-seong likes me.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.132
I know you know that.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.435
Love...

19:31.136 --> 19:32.804
doesn't come just like that.

19:33.872 --> 19:37.009
-You need innate talent...
-You need innate talent,

19:37.976 --> 19:39.545
inspiration, and sensibility.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.847
And inspiration and sensibility.

19:43.482 --> 19:44.716
Don't you think so?

19:46.151 --> 19:48.253
You shouldn't just mimic
whoever you think is cool.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.024
If you want to be in a relationship,
do it right.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.861
You shouldn't just mimic
whoever you think is cool.

19:57.996 --> 20:01.466
You. Are you...

20:03.569 --> 20:05.737
-Jang U-jae!
-Do you remember now?

20:06.972 --> 20:08.440
I hinted it to you several times,

20:09.541 --> 20:11.343
but you were too slow to catch on.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.112
It's great to see you.
You've come a long way.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.748
It seems like just yesterday
that you couldn't tune your guitar.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.283
You've improved a lot.

20:21.787 --> 20:25.624
I said I would have you on your knees
within three years, didn't I?

20:26.959 --> 20:29.094
I came to this school
to revel in my victory,

20:30.295 --> 20:32.297
but it's no fun
because you've gotten so pathetic now.

20:35.367 --> 20:38.537
Well, guess what?
You're still a greenhorn in my eyes.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.609
Like I said, don't just mimic
whoever you think is cool.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.948
We'll see who the greenhorn is
at the upcoming audition.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.051
Take good care of your knees until then.

20:55.487 --> 20:57.522
Oh, one more thing.

20:58.890 --> 21:03.128
You're no longer up against
the Jang U-jae of three years ago.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.598
It is JB you're going up against.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.401
It's not like I was hibernating
for the last three years.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.972
You look well-rested though.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.576
What?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.482
Stop running away.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.551
You can't live
as your 10-year-old self forever.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.659
Come on, guys. You can't give up already.

21:34.259 --> 21:37.796
I'm going to look for a gig
as a backup dancer.

21:38.330 --> 21:41.066
I'm going to try out
for Superstar K again.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.335
They raised the prize money again.

21:46.672 --> 21:50.575
Ms. Ahn, I might have to transfer
to another school like Hae-seong.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.112
I knew this was how things would end up.

21:57.883 --> 21:58.850
Ms. Ahn.

21:59.184 --> 22:00.786
I'm going to become a super idol.

22:01.853 --> 22:04.623
You already are a super idol.

22:06.091 --> 22:07.392
I mean,

22:08.026 --> 22:10.228
I'm going to prove
that I deserve that title

22:10.762 --> 22:12.898
by winning the audition.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.199
I will come in first place.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.970
I'll bring JB to his knees.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.316
What?

22:31.616 --> 22:33.819
You want to change it all,
both the song and choreography?

22:34.319 --> 22:35.454
What are you thinking of?

22:36.822 --> 22:39.825
I think there's a twist to the theme.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.927
What do you mean?

22:42.661 --> 22:44.529
There's no set answer.

22:45.630 --> 22:46.465
Listen to this.

22:59.144 --> 23:04.383
When the rain falls,
You always come to my mind

23:04.449 --> 23:09.454
The memory of you tortures me
Through the night

23:09.621 --> 23:13.925
Who will wipe all my tears away?

23:13.992 --> 23:17.062
The hot tears running down my face

23:17.129 --> 23:21.666
When your love rains down on my eyes

23:21.733 --> 23:26.004
I can see you standing
Right in front of me

23:26.071 --> 23:29.608
When your love rains down on my ears

23:29.674 --> 23:33.145
I can hear you whispering love to me

23:33.211 --> 23:37.115
When I hold you, my love, in my arms

23:37.182 --> 23:41.253
I can be happy again

23:41.319 --> 23:43.188
Following the road
Where the sun shines on...

23:43.255 --> 23:45.257
The word "bi" could mean "rain"

23:47.125 --> 23:48.560
as well as "sadness."

23:49.161 --> 23:51.096
You are saying we should create a story

23:51.163 --> 23:53.131
using ideas associated with
the word "bi," right?

23:54.132 --> 23:55.467
Like a musical.

23:55.867 --> 23:56.868
It will be fun.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.504
Why are you so enthusiastic about this

23:59.971 --> 24:03.341
all of a sudden
as if you are trying to impress someone?

24:07.646 --> 24:09.314
What are you talking about?

24:10.148 --> 24:13.318
It's good to be motivated,
but we don't have much time.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.888
We should hurry if we're going to change
the choreography and costumes.

24:17.088 --> 24:18.089
Don't worry.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.592
We'll show them what real pros can do.

24:45.550 --> 24:48.220
Yu-jin, what now?

24:48.520 --> 24:49.354
Ms. Ahn.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.189
Do you know this feeling?

24:52.057 --> 24:54.693
The feeling when you realize
that the answers you filled out for a test

24:55.360 --> 24:59.564
don't correspond to its questions
because of a blunder you made?

25:01.099 --> 25:02.701
What exactly do you mean?

25:04.069 --> 25:06.505
Don't you think it's too easy

25:07.472 --> 25:10.008
if the answer to the mission
is a medley of Rain's hit songs?

25:10.775 --> 25:12.310
During an audition,

25:12.844 --> 25:15.547
you are supposed to
differentiate yourself from others.

25:16.615 --> 25:19.951
Cookie-cutter impersonations
are guaranteed to fail.

25:20.719 --> 25:24.155
So what do you think is the right answer?

25:26.858 --> 25:29.861
I think the answer lies in the word "bi."

25:30.529 --> 25:34.533
That's why we're singing Rain's hit songs.
Because the word itself means "rain."

25:35.767 --> 25:36.935
The thing is,

25:37.536 --> 25:39.271
we need to stand out.

25:39.938 --> 25:42.707
We have to do something
that's ours and ours only.

25:42.774 --> 25:45.810
That's why we're singing Rain's songs.

25:45.877 --> 25:50.015
No, we really need something better.

25:50.081 --> 25:51.016
Something different.

25:52.651 --> 25:55.687
I actually agree with Yu-jin.

25:56.421 --> 25:58.924
What could "bi" mean other than "rain"?

26:22.080 --> 26:23.014
Hello.

26:26.217 --> 26:27.352
Hold on.

26:31.623 --> 26:34.960
Let me ask you something
as your senior in the music industry.

26:36.461 --> 26:39.431
Why did you pick Jin Yu-jin
as the first super idol?

26:42.200 --> 26:45.170
Oz Entertainment kids
are already top idols.

26:46.404 --> 26:48.006
Unless we rock the boat,

26:49.140 --> 26:51.376
they will remain complacent.

26:52.577 --> 26:53.578
What do you mean?

26:53.945 --> 26:58.183
Are you saying you're merely using Yu-jin

26:58.249 --> 27:00.285
to motivate the Oz kids?

27:02.687 --> 27:03.989
Let's say he's a pacemaker.

27:05.490 --> 27:06.491
A pacemaker?

27:07.792 --> 27:12.097
A pacemaker supports,
motivates, and shields

27:12.831 --> 27:17.736
a potential winner in an Olympic marathon.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.405
I know what a pacemaker does,

27:21.706 --> 27:25.010
but I doubt that Yu-jin
volunteered to play that role.

27:28.246 --> 27:30.215
What we need is a superstar,

27:31.383 --> 27:36.154
someone who's irreplaceable
like Michael Jackson or Lady Gaga.

27:37.722 --> 27:41.259
Don't you think being a pacemaker
for the creation of such a superstar

27:42.894 --> 27:44.262
is worthwhile?

27:44.996 --> 27:48.500
It's up to Yu-jin to decide
whether that's worthwhile.

27:49.467 --> 27:50.869
What I want to say is,

27:52.704 --> 27:54.105
the kid is only 19 years old,

27:55.040 --> 27:59.177
but he's gone through
a lot of pain and hardship.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.579
He's hurt and vulnerable.

28:02.647 --> 28:05.083
-So--
-No one forced it on him.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.452
It was his own decision.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.722
And who knows?

28:12.057 --> 28:13.925
The pacemaker may end up winning the race.

28:27.305 --> 28:29.941
RAIN? WINTER RAIN, PERFORMANCE CONCEPT

28:43.288 --> 28:44.522
DICTIONARY

28:44.589 --> 28:45.557
SEARCH RESULTS FOR BI

28:54.566 --> 28:55.633
Hello?

28:57.368 --> 28:58.570
The broadcasting station?

29:00.438 --> 29:01.940
Hae-seong's there?

29:24.529 --> 29:25.764
Hello.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.570
I'm Shin Hae-seong.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.106
Hae-seong? Nice to meet you.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.174
You're very pretty.

29:37.776 --> 29:42.547
How did you know that the song was mine?

29:45.316 --> 29:47.185
Your homeroom teacher

29:47.252 --> 29:49.354
gave CDs of your song to us
here at the broadcasting station.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.524
Ms. Ahn did?

29:55.126 --> 29:57.295
SHIN HAE-SEONG

29:58.696 --> 29:59.931
Hi.

30:03.535 --> 30:04.569
Rian!

30:06.070 --> 30:07.338
Are you feeling better?

30:07.772 --> 30:10.508
-You look tired.
-I'm fine.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.812
I didn't think you would make it today.
Thank you so much for coming.

30:13.878 --> 30:16.181
Even if I'm sick,
I could never say no to you.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.184
How have you been?

30:20.285 --> 30:21.219
Good.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.402
Ms. Ahn, what are you doing?

30:38.670 --> 30:39.938
Be quiet.

30:40.004 --> 30:43.508
This is Hae-seong's first radio broadcast.
I can't miss a single word.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.378
The kids have a lot to thank you for.

30:47.445 --> 30:50.148
I don't think they know how many times
you've called the radio station.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.984
I didn't do much. Please keep it down.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.323
We have two special guests today.

30:58.389 --> 31:01.726
We recently introduced to you
the song "Hello to Myself,"

31:01.793 --> 31:04.963
and today, we have HershE's Rian
and songwriter Ms. Shin Hae-seong.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.632
-Welcome to the show.
-Hello. I'm Rian.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.134
Hello. I'm Shin Hae-seong.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.937
I'm delighted to have you on the show.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.106
You two seem very close.

31:15.940 --> 31:19.310
Yes, Hae-seong is the first friend
I made after I transferred.

31:19.577 --> 31:21.212
She's my roommate at school.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.781
She's a really good friend.

31:26.050 --> 31:30.622
After it was first featured
on our show, Hug the Radio,

31:30.688 --> 31:32.724
requests for your song
have been flooding in

31:32.790 --> 31:35.994
although it hasn't been
officially released.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.463
How do you feel?

31:39.631 --> 31:42.000
It feels like a dream.

31:42.700 --> 31:47.205
I never imagined I would hear
my own song on the radio.

31:48.539 --> 31:52.210
At first, people thought
that HershE's Rian wrote the song.

31:52.543 --> 31:56.848
Hae-seong had to transfer schools
due to personal reasons,

31:58.283 --> 32:01.719
so I took the stage instead of her.

32:03.388 --> 32:06.824
It was her last day at school,

32:12.096 --> 32:15.800
so I sang it as my farewell gift to her.

32:17.635 --> 32:19.370
I wanted the song to comfort her

32:20.705 --> 32:22.507
and give her strength to move on.

32:25.143 --> 32:27.512
So that's how it was.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.648
So Rian sang it for Hae-seong
to bid her farewell.

32:31.149 --> 32:32.717
She's such a hypocrite.

32:33.184 --> 32:35.720
She acted like she wrote the song.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.221
A farewell gift? Give me a break.

32:38.523 --> 32:41.826
I'm envious of your friendship.
Had you known, Hae-seong?

32:42.593 --> 32:44.195
She probably didn't.

32:46.364 --> 32:48.366
It was a surprise,

32:49.467 --> 32:51.102
so I told her about it after the show.

32:52.570 --> 32:53.972
Oh, really?

32:54.639 --> 32:55.606
Hae-seong?

33:00.211 --> 33:01.779
Yes, that's right.

33:03.514 --> 33:07.018
I'm very grateful to Rian.

33:08.252 --> 33:10.688
Had it not been for her,

33:11.422 --> 33:14.425
my song wouldn't have become
this well-known.

33:17.362 --> 33:19.864
You're so modest.

33:20.698 --> 33:22.633
No. I really mean it.

33:25.536 --> 33:28.306
I don't consider this
to be my song, per se.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.676
It was my friends
who made this song possible.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.245
I may have written it,

33:35.613 --> 33:37.382
but JB arranged it,

33:37.682 --> 33:39.917
the Kirin Art School's band played it,

33:40.485 --> 33:42.487
and Rian sang it.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.923
If it hadn't been for my friends,

33:46.324 --> 33:49.427
this song wouldn't have come to light.

33:50.762 --> 33:54.399
I'm so thankful to my friends

33:55.366 --> 33:56.701
for breathing life into my song.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.371
When I first heard "Hello to Myself,"

34:00.805 --> 34:04.108
it felt like the song was about me.

34:04.675 --> 34:07.412
What was your inspiration?

34:08.379 --> 34:11.983
There are many talented students
at Kirin Art School.

34:12.750 --> 34:17.622
Compared to everyone else,
I'm lacking in so many ways.

34:19.991 --> 34:22.293
I felt like the tortoise.

34:23.428 --> 34:26.497
I couldn't catch up with the hares
no matter how hard I tried.

34:27.932 --> 34:30.735
I slept less and worked
as hard as I could,

34:32.103 --> 34:33.805
but once I got to where I thought
I should be,

34:34.772 --> 34:37.275
my classmates were way ahead of me.

34:38.609 --> 34:42.847
My hard work was futile.

34:43.848 --> 34:47.418
We were just born different.

34:48.352 --> 34:51.823
I was born a tortoise
while they were born hares.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.761
I just expressed those frustrated feelings
in the form of a song

34:56.828 --> 34:58.696
as if I would write them down in my diary.

35:13.478 --> 35:14.312
Ms. Ahn.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.514
I got it.

35:18.616 --> 35:19.517
"B"!

35:20.418 --> 35:22.587
Eureka!

35:28.459 --> 35:30.061
When I first started out as a singer,

35:30.828 --> 35:34.165
a famous songwriter once told me this.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.704
"Good music isn't simply made.
Rather the music finds you."

35:40.905 --> 35:42.106
It finds you?

35:42.840 --> 35:45.943
You have to be competent enough
for the music to find you.

35:46.777 --> 35:50.515
As long as you keep up your passion,

35:50.581 --> 35:53.251
there will be many more
pleasant surprises awaiting you.

35:55.453 --> 35:56.487
Be it good songs,

35:58.856 --> 36:00.024
or good friends.

36:04.228 --> 36:08.166
We should listen to Hae-seong's
"Hello to Myself," right?

36:08.533 --> 36:09.367
Sure.

36:13.471 --> 36:14.372
Hae-seong.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.942
May I have the honor of singing your song?

36:19.710 --> 36:20.545
Pardon?

36:20.611 --> 36:22.847
I wanted your permission.

36:24.348 --> 36:27.018
I would love to hear you sing it.

36:36.327 --> 36:40.164
It's February 2012

36:40.598 --> 36:44.135
It's a cold, cold winter

36:48.472 --> 36:52.410
How close are you

36:52.777 --> 36:57.215
To the dream
That you wanted to realize so bad?

36:57.582 --> 37:01.986
Here, I am being let down and crying

37:02.053 --> 37:04.855
I get hurt and frustrated

37:05.189 --> 37:09.126
I have no strength to get back up

37:09.794 --> 37:16.133
But you would probably smile at me
When you see me

37:22.173 --> 37:28.379
Would you please tell me not to cry?

37:30.982 --> 37:33.851
Don't cry

37:37.255 --> 37:40.291
Please

37:46.764 --> 37:51.135
Would you please think of me and smile?

37:54.805 --> 37:57.842
You have to let me listen
to the next song you write.

37:58.476 --> 37:59.310
Pardon?

37:59.677 --> 38:03.614
I would like to make an album
with your songs.

38:04.949 --> 38:05.783
Definitely.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.371
A single radio appearance

38:28.472 --> 38:29.573
doesn't make you a star.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.677
You may think you've made it,

38:33.811 --> 38:35.846
but no one will remember you.

38:36.380 --> 38:37.415
Don't worry.

38:38.416 --> 38:40.618
I'm content with this

38:41.552 --> 38:43.821
because I've found my path.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.457
I won't wander around anymore.

39:32.336 --> 39:33.170
Hi.

39:34.605 --> 39:35.506
I'm back.

39:35.806 --> 39:38.175
Welcome back.

40:12.443 --> 40:14.145
You just saw a show. You should pay up.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.789
-But that's--
-Thanks.

40:27.324 --> 40:29.727
And thank you for coming back too.

40:32.029 --> 40:33.197
Gosh.

40:44.809 --> 40:45.709
Shin Hae-seong.

40:46.310 --> 40:48.946
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

40:49.647 --> 40:52.349
Congrats on your first radio appearance.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.251
You heard me on the radio?

40:54.318 --> 40:56.086
We all did.

40:56.153 --> 40:59.657
Who would have thought
you would be the first to go pro?

41:03.727 --> 41:05.996
Thank you, Ms. Ahn.

41:06.630 --> 41:10.401
I heard you gave CDs of my song
to everyone at the radio station.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.102
You heard?

41:12.169 --> 41:13.571
I wanted to keep it a secret.

41:15.272 --> 41:16.407
Here.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.312
LETTER OF ADMISSION

41:21.378 --> 41:25.783
-I can come back?
-My goodness.

41:25.850 --> 41:29.620
You're a hotshot songwriter.
Kirin is where you belong.

41:30.254 --> 41:31.288
Ms. Ahn.

41:31.355 --> 41:34.658
This is perfect timing.
Exams are coming up.

41:35.059 --> 41:39.196
As always, we will need
copies of your class notes.

41:39.263 --> 41:42.466
We also need your list
of potential exam questions.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.104
Without Shin Hae-seong,
the average GPA here will drop.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.072
Right?

41:48.138 --> 41:52.376
I missed you so much.
I'm never letting you go again.

42:04.121 --> 42:09.360
I've realized that the answer
to the theme is the letter B, not bi.

42:11.128 --> 42:13.397
And the person who led me to this idea

42:14.798 --> 42:15.733
is Shin Hae-seong.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.701
It's you.

42:19.403 --> 42:20.371
Me?

42:21.739 --> 42:24.174
"B"? The letter B?

42:24.608 --> 42:27.444
Yes, B. Not A.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.558
I get it.

42:42.860 --> 42:45.262
B, which can't become A.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.901
B-GRADE STUDENTS OF KIRIN
SEEKING THE A-GRADE LIFE

42:50.968 --> 42:53.537
B-GRADE STUDENTS OF KIRIN
SEEKING TO BE THE BEST

42:55.539 --> 42:58.175
B-grade students who want to be A-grade

42:59.043 --> 43:01.779
and are hoping to become the best.

43:02.546 --> 43:03.380
What do you think?

43:04.081 --> 43:05.215
Wow.

43:07.818 --> 43:11.622
We are B-grade

43:11.956 --> 43:14.258
A-grade is what we want to be

43:14.692 --> 43:18.796
We're still only B-grade

43:19.096 --> 43:21.498
But we want to be the best

43:21.932 --> 43:25.769
We are B-grade

43:25.836 --> 43:28.205
A-grade is what we want to be

43:28.639 --> 43:32.509
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

43:32.576 --> 43:34.845
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

43:35.179 --> 43:39.049
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

43:39.116 --> 43:41.418
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

43:41.685 --> 43:45.589
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

43:45.656 --> 43:48.058
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

43:48.325 --> 43:52.162
We're still only B-grade

43:52.229 --> 43:54.598
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

43:54.932 --> 43:58.769
We're still only B-grade

43:58.836 --> 44:01.271
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

44:01.572 --> 44:02.873
-We are B
-We are B

44:05.376 --> 44:07.778
-This is it. This is real music.
-You're right.

44:07.845 --> 44:12.182
-This is what I'm talking about.
-This is awesome!

44:12.650 --> 44:15.386
Check out our B-rate choreography.

44:31.635 --> 44:32.503
What do you think?

44:34.805 --> 44:36.640
Isn't there anything we can do?

44:37.708 --> 44:40.210
I'll try something easier.

44:41.311 --> 44:42.379
Check it out.

44:56.260 --> 44:57.194
How about this?

44:57.728 --> 45:01.999
Hey, we can't do that.
Plus, Hae-seong is performing with us.

45:04.501 --> 45:06.670
Any easier, and it will look
more like calisthenics than dance.

45:08.572 --> 45:09.440
Check it out.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.791
That's more like it.

45:27.858 --> 45:28.759
Yes?

45:46.343 --> 45:47.544
Oh, my goodness.

45:47.778 --> 45:51.315
Are you spying? Isn't that cheating?

45:52.416 --> 45:54.284
Spying?

45:54.685 --> 45:56.153
Hardly.

45:57.621 --> 46:00.157
There's nothing worth spying on.

46:08.165 --> 46:11.301
Shin Hae-seong is quite
the lost cause, isn't she?

46:12.836 --> 46:15.005
There's nothing
anyone can do for that girl.

46:16.173 --> 46:21.111
Don't you have a lost cause
in your class as well?

46:21.645 --> 46:23.380
What are you talking about?

46:24.648 --> 46:26.150
What do you plan to do about Rian?

46:29.586 --> 46:32.890
I heard she's too sick
to take part in the audition.

46:33.590 --> 46:35.826
It's a shame the prettiest member
won't be able to take part.

46:35.893 --> 46:38.428
After all, a teen idol group
is about looks.

46:43.167 --> 46:45.936
Students have questions, not answers.

46:46.236 --> 46:48.372
It's our job to help them
find the answers to their questions.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.975
I only just realized that.

47:47.331 --> 47:49.366
How long were you standing there?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.136
Aren't you hungry?

48:02.579 --> 48:03.580
You were good.

48:10.320 --> 48:12.723
But the audition won't be easy.

48:14.591 --> 48:17.361
You won't be dressed like that
for the audition, right?

48:18.428 --> 48:19.663
I'm comfortable in this.

48:20.063 --> 48:23.133
You need a dress and heels,
not sweatpants and sneakers.

48:24.034 --> 48:26.036
You have to be able to dance
in less comfortable clothing.

48:27.237 --> 48:28.238
No way.

48:28.705 --> 48:30.440
How can I dance decked out like that?

48:32.609 --> 48:33.543
You can.

48:35.045 --> 48:36.079
I'll help you.

49:36.573 --> 49:37.541
It suits you.

49:39.242 --> 49:40.177
It's very pretty.

49:40.777 --> 49:42.980
I feel a bit awkward.

49:45.048 --> 49:46.283
I learned this when I started out.

49:47.117 --> 49:49.653
Be a pro on the outside,
and you'll become one on the inside.

49:51.855 --> 49:53.523
Rehearse as you would perform
in an actual show.

49:54.224 --> 49:55.192
Do what you did before.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.228
What? Here?

49:58.729 --> 50:00.497
Yes. Here.

50:06.503 --> 50:07.337
This.

50:16.546 --> 50:19.916
You did well in rehearsal,
so you'll do fine at the audition.

50:26.289 --> 50:28.558
Thanks for everything since yesterday.

50:30.293 --> 50:32.963
Just think of it as a gift
from your very first fan.

50:35.265 --> 50:36.199
But...

50:36.900 --> 50:38.568
why are you being so nice to me?

50:39.069 --> 50:40.370
We're not even on the same team.

50:41.304 --> 50:44.441
-That's because--
-Don't say you're my fan.

50:47.744 --> 50:48.645
So...

50:49.980 --> 50:52.649
About what you said at the church...

50:53.116 --> 50:54.985
Oh, that...

50:58.255 --> 50:59.956
If you're being nice to me
because you're worried

51:00.023 --> 51:03.060
that I may have misinterpreted
what you said, let it go.

51:03.794 --> 51:04.795
Don't worry.

51:06.696 --> 51:08.398
I'm not worried about that.

51:09.699 --> 51:10.567
It's just...

51:13.737 --> 51:15.739
I have to go practice.

51:16.473 --> 51:17.407
I'd better get going.

51:19.042 --> 51:19.876
Thanks again.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.695
He hasn't forgotten.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.498
What's your favorite flower?

51:42.199 --> 51:44.267
Roses? Baby's breath?

51:46.269 --> 51:48.772
Two yellow tulips.

51:49.573 --> 51:50.407
That's what I like.

51:51.074 --> 51:54.611
Roses and baby's breath
are too bulky and unruly.

52:30.647 --> 52:33.116
-Here.
-This is great.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.619
Hae-seong's not here,
so there's more to go around.

52:36.219 --> 52:37.354
Thanks.

52:37.420 --> 52:39.089
-This looks great.
-Bon appétit.

52:39.156 --> 52:41.424
-Let's dig in.
-This is awesome.

52:45.095 --> 52:47.631
-Let's eat away.
-This is so good.

52:50.233 --> 52:51.635
Shin Hae-seong.

52:52.469 --> 52:55.906
Did you get a makeover?
You look so pretty.

52:56.473 --> 52:59.576
Who talked you into it? Was it JB?

53:02.078 --> 53:03.947
No.

53:04.948 --> 53:08.351
Then who turned our little bear
into a sexy fox?

53:10.654 --> 53:13.456
Plus, what time
did you get back last night?

53:13.723 --> 53:15.458
I didn't see you when I woke up.

53:15.892 --> 53:17.227
Did you spend the night out?

53:18.328 --> 53:19.229
What?

53:19.863 --> 53:20.864
Night out?

53:21.198 --> 53:22.265
Are you insane?

53:23.300 --> 53:24.935
You were late for rehearsal too.

53:25.969 --> 53:28.838
You should be practicing,
not dating around!

53:56.299 --> 53:57.200
All done!

54:11.848 --> 54:12.882
Found it.

54:24.394 --> 54:25.228
It's a present.

54:32.102 --> 54:33.370
I have nine more pairs to go.

54:34.170 --> 54:37.474
I'll make my debut by the time
I wear out nine more pairs.

54:40.143 --> 54:43.346
Do you still have the nine sneakers
that I gave you?

54:46.816 --> 54:48.618
Shin Hae-seong! Look!

54:48.685 --> 54:49.719
I did it.

54:56.092 --> 54:56.926
Rian.

54:57.861 --> 54:59.296
I thought you were still in the hospital.

55:06.069 --> 55:07.137
You still had them.

55:17.881 --> 55:19.716
Do you remember what you said

55:20.717 --> 55:21.818
when you gave me the first one?

55:23.953 --> 55:25.722
You said it symbolized
your hard work and passion.

55:27.857 --> 55:28.858
Did you...

55:30.093 --> 55:31.294
really mean it?

55:32.395 --> 55:33.229
Yes.

55:33.997 --> 55:34.864
And now?

55:36.733 --> 55:38.535
What do you feel...

55:40.203 --> 55:41.037
toward me?

55:46.476 --> 55:47.410
Do you like...

55:49.979 --> 55:50.947
Shin Hae-seong?

55:57.354 --> 56:00.056
I just want things to work out for her.

56:01.391 --> 56:04.861
I want to help her and cheer her on.

56:06.863 --> 56:10.066
I don't know if that means I like her.

56:42.999 --> 56:43.967
It would have been better

56:45.201 --> 56:47.070
if you had just told me you liked her.

57:51.668 --> 57:58.675
KIRIN ART SCHOOL

58:01.444 --> 58:04.547
There's a winner and a loser
in every competition.

58:05.582 --> 58:10.320
You will witness the winner rejoice
and the loser lament today.

58:12.388 --> 58:15.124
After watching the performances,
you will cast your votes.

58:15.725 --> 58:20.563
Your votes will determine
the winner and the loser.

58:22.131 --> 58:25.768
The baseball legend,
Yogi Berra, once said,

58:26.936 --> 58:29.105
"It ain't over till it's over."

58:30.874 --> 58:35.411
Ultimately, a game is not over
until one side gives up.

58:36.679 --> 58:39.215
Even if there's only one out to go,

58:39.682 --> 58:41.417
and no matter how great
the difference in scores,

58:41.718 --> 58:43.253
the game's not over until it's over.

58:44.754 --> 58:48.858
There's always a chance
for the losing team to come out on top.

58:49.859 --> 58:51.294
Whether you give up...

58:52.328 --> 58:53.563
or pull off a miracle

58:54.497 --> 58:57.667
is up to you.

59:01.037 --> 59:05.408
The theme of today's audition
is the one-syllable word "bi."

59:06.042 --> 59:09.345
The key to this performance will be

59:09.646 --> 59:11.581
how creatively a team
has interpreted the word.

59:32.569 --> 59:34.203
I'm sure it won't happen,

59:34.504 --> 59:38.007
but even if you make a mistake,
don't worry about it.

59:39.008 --> 59:40.176
Winning isn't everything.

59:40.410 --> 59:44.113
Go out and have a great time
like we did when we rehearsed.

59:44.847 --> 59:45.748
Jin Yu-jin.

59:46.983 --> 59:49.385
-Don't act all cool.
-What?

59:49.719 --> 59:52.088
I know how much you want to win,

59:52.689 --> 59:55.458
so you don't have to pretend
to be all cool.

59:59.429 --> 1:00:03.433
I am proud of you all.
You all know that, right?

1:00:03.766 --> 1:00:07.437
No matter what happens today,
I'm proud and very thankful.

1:00:07.770 --> 1:00:12.976
You've put in a lot of hard work already,
so just enjoy today.

1:00:13.643 --> 1:00:15.144
Don't get scared or nervous.

1:00:15.211 --> 1:00:16.245
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:00:16.746 --> 1:00:18.548
Let's have a cheer.

1:00:25.154 --> 1:00:27.657
-One, two, three. Let's do this!
-One, two, three. Let's do this!

1:00:34.564 --> 1:00:36.666
We are B,

1:00:37.300 --> 1:00:38.801
which cannot be A.

1:00:39.902 --> 1:00:42.672
We are B-grade, which cannot be A-grade.

1:00:44.107 --> 1:00:46.142
We are in the low-level class,

1:00:46.843 --> 1:00:50.179
branded as B-grade here at Kirin.

1:00:51.614 --> 1:00:54.484
It's not just in our school
that students are differentiated.

1:00:55.918 --> 1:00:59.422
In any school,
there are good students and bad students,

1:01:00.189 --> 1:01:02.325
students on an academic track
and those on a vocational track.

1:01:03.426 --> 1:01:05.495
The names may be different,

1:01:05.795 --> 1:01:07.664
but we are always classified
into A-grade and B-grade.

1:01:09.899 --> 1:01:13.670
I had left this school

1:01:14.237 --> 1:01:15.972
and only came back a few days ago.

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:22.612
I ran away because I was ashamed
that I couldn't sing.

1:01:39.996 --> 1:01:42.065
This is what I would like to ask you.

1:01:43.866 --> 1:01:47.170
Should dreams be exclusively
for talented people?

1:01:48.771 --> 1:01:52.642
Should those less talented not even dream?

1:01:57.113 --> 1:02:01.217
You have to close your eyes
before you can dream.

1:02:02.985 --> 1:02:04.353
And when you close your eyes,

1:02:04.821 --> 1:02:08.524
it no longer matters
how other people look at you.

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:14.397
It is only when you close your eyes
that you can face the real you,

1:02:14.997 --> 1:02:17.266
not the person everyone says that you are.

1:02:18.534 --> 1:02:22.739
The real me I see when I close my eyes

1:02:23.906 --> 1:02:25.508
says this to me.

1:02:27.477 --> 1:02:30.947
"Don't give up on your dream."

1:02:33.049 --> 1:02:37.687
That's because dreams
are not for the talented.

1:02:38.921 --> 1:02:41.257
It's for those who dare to dream.

1:02:43.826 --> 1:02:49.165
Like braving a storm
with nothing but a small umbrella,

1:02:50.299 --> 1:02:55.872
we will now dare to dream big
with the little we've got.

1:03:00.276 --> 1:03:06.349
This song is dedicated
to those who agonize over their dreams

1:03:07.083 --> 1:03:10.686
and to those who are told
to give up on their dreams.

1:03:12.155 --> 1:03:15.091
This song is for all those
who are branded as B-grade.

1:03:47.690 --> 1:03:50.560
One, two, one, two, three, four

1:03:53.262 --> 1:03:56.365
No one notices me when I walk past

1:03:56.432 --> 1:03:59.602
Mediocre looks, mediocre standards

1:03:59.669 --> 1:04:02.371
I'm as plain as can be

1:04:05.374 --> 1:04:08.144
I'm just a boy among many other boys

1:04:08.211 --> 1:04:11.314
There's nothing special about me

1:04:11.380 --> 1:04:14.016
Nothing to make me stand out

1:04:14.083 --> 1:04:17.353
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

1:04:17.420 --> 1:04:19.589
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

1:04:19.655 --> 1:04:23.159
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

1:04:23.226 --> 1:04:25.628
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

1:04:25.695 --> 1:04:29.065
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

1:04:29.131 --> 1:04:31.534
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

1:04:31.601 --> 1:04:35.004
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

1:04:35.071 --> 1:04:37.440
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:40.509
I do nothing important

1:04:40.576 --> 1:04:43.613
Everything seems pointless

1:04:43.679 --> 1:04:46.415
I work up a sweat

1:04:46.482 --> 1:04:49.785
For nothing

1:04:49.852 --> 1:04:52.388
I'm frustrated as can be

1:04:52.455 --> 1:04:55.491
But even more frustrating to others

1:04:55.558 --> 1:04:58.361
Seeing the looks on their faces

1:04:58.427 --> 1:05:01.297
Wears me out even more

1:05:01.364 --> 1:05:04.634
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:07.036
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

1:05:07.103 --> 1:05:10.606
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

1:05:10.673 --> 1:05:12.975
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

1:05:13.042 --> 1:05:16.512
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

1:05:16.579 --> 1:05:18.848
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

1:05:18.915 --> 1:05:22.485
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

1:05:22.551 --> 1:05:24.754
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

1:05:24.820 --> 1:05:26.455
-One day
-One day

1:05:26.789 --> 1:05:32.028
-I hope to find that inner spark
-I hope to find that inner spark

1:05:32.461 --> 1:05:33.829
-One day
-One day

1:05:33.896 --> 1:05:36.365
-I hope to shine as I am meant to
-I hope to shine as I am meant to

1:05:36.432 --> 1:05:40.970
-Will that day come
-Will that day come

1:05:41.337 --> 1:05:43.773
-Before I lose the fading light
-Before I lose the fading light

1:05:44.307 --> 1:05:48.244
-Of my dream?
-Of my dream?

1:05:48.744 --> 1:05:52.014
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

1:05:52.081 --> 1:05:54.450
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

1:05:54.517 --> 1:05:58.020
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

1:05:58.087 --> 1:06:00.356
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best

1:06:00.423 --> 1:06:03.893
-We are B-grade
-We are B-grade

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:06.195
-A-grade is what we want to be
-A-grade is what we want to be

1:06:06.262 --> 1:06:09.865
-We're still only B-grade
-We're still only B-grade

1:06:09.932 --> 1:06:12.168
-But we want to be the best
-But we want to be the best
