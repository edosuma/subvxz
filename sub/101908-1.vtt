WEBVTT

01:55.991 --> 01:57.868
Hey, there you go.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.412
How was the game?

02:00.495 --> 02:03.665
0-8. Tackleberry here even got booted
in the fourth.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.417
Crap. I was rooting for you.

02:05.501 --> 02:08.794
We can't all be big winners
like Stan The Man here.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.088
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:10.172 --> 02:14.510
You better watch it or I'll tell your mom
you pulled in here smelling like hooch.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.764
Yeah. Yeah. I didn't get this smart
by being stupid.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.600
Oh, then how did you?

02:23.268 --> 02:25.229
Good Lord's work, I guess.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.815
- Sure wasn't from no books.
- Yeah.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.195
Hey, keep to the back roads. Hey.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.531
- Head on a swivel, huh?
- All right.

02:35.614 --> 02:39.701
- Thanks for the wise words. Yeah.
- You should be a guidance counselor.

02:45.207 --> 02:48.418
Stanley, I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.004
What you got, Stanley?

02:52.005 --> 02:56.134
Okay, I got 592 dol... No.

02:57.135 --> 03:01.890
Oh, jeez, 529 dollars and 34 cents.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.017
Oh, shit.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.311
Well, you want me to do a recount?

03:06.395 --> 03:10.357
No, no, no, I got a shift to turn over
and a poker game to go to.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.027
Ain't no way I'm recounting the drawer
over a damn 34 cents?

03:14.111 --> 03:16.321
Are you sure?
Because I'll start from scratch.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.282
There's no problem.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.793
You know Monday's my last shift?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.379
Yeah. Thirty-eight years to the day.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.716
Yeah, 38, that's right. That's what
they said the word on the street is.

03:35.799 --> 03:39.887
It's Tuesday morning technically,
you know, according to payroll.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.432
Then it's hasta la vista, baby.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.978
That's <i>The Terminator.</i> It's from...

03:49.271 --> 03:50.814
That's <i>T2</i> actually.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.026
I don't know what we going to do
without you, Stanley.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.361
Guess we'll have to shut
the whole joint down, huh?

03:56.445 --> 03:58.363
I doubt that.

04:00.282 --> 04:04.244
Did you find a replacement
for the graveyard shift yet?

04:04.328 --> 04:06.496
Yeah. That's what I'm working on.

04:06.580 --> 04:11.460
Oh, whoever you get,
I just hope they're up to snuff.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.546
You know,
it's like my mom always used to say:

04:15.672 --> 04:19.968
"Some people turn up their sleeves,
and some just don't turn up at all."

04:28.477 --> 04:29.770
Screw Shazz.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.608
She's jealous because you're finally
getting out of this shithole.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.485
Albion is not a shithole.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.279
If you ask 10 average Americans

04:39.363 --> 04:43.408
to describe Albion, Michigan,
in two words,

04:43.492 --> 04:46.537
"shit" and "hole" will be at the top
of their list.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.374
I mean,
why would anybody ever come to Albion?

04:52.251 --> 04:56.505
Well, a lot of people go
to the cider mill.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.345
Hey, could you take me to pick up
some of those moving boxes later?

05:03.428 --> 05:06.515
I don't wanna rummage
through my sister's garage.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.268
- You live there.
- Still feels intrusive.

05:09.351 --> 05:13.272
I can't afford to be buying
a bunch of empty boxes just for moving.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.066
I'm short of cash as it is.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.987
Buying empty boxes does feel
kind of stupid.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.533
I should be studying for my DMV exam.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.493
You still worried about that test?

05:26.577 --> 05:30.497
I told you,
only retards and ex-cons fail that thing.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.629
What do you know
about this replacement of yours?

05:37.713 --> 05:40.591
Nothing, except his name's Jevon.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.177
Jevon?

05:44.178 --> 05:47.222
- The fuck kind of name is that?
- Heck if I know.

05:47.306 --> 05:50.100
I just hope
he's not some fricking deadbeat.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.675
I'm mostly a homebody anyway.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.054
Jevon Williams.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.484
Is that how you typically sit
for an entrance interview?

06:44.696 --> 06:48.325
My bad. Didn't realize
this was an interview.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.495
I'm asking questions.
You're answering them, aren't you?

06:53.163 --> 06:56.166
Now, it says here
you just got out of county.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.544
Have you made a plan
for gainful employment?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.963
I applied for a few jobs around town,

07:01.046 --> 07:04.800
but I've quit or been fired
from most of them.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.886
So kind of puts me in a tough spot.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.808
But I did get a call back
from Oscar's Chicken N' Fish.

07:14.268 --> 07:18.647
It's a regional chain.
I wouldn't exactly call it gainful.

07:19.815 --> 07:23.110
I'm assigning you Officer Kelly,
who just transferred from Corrections.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.280
Hi there. It's nice to meet you.
You can just call me Evelyn.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.574
She'll meet you here tomorrow at 2

07:28.657 --> 07:31.785
to go over the conditions
of your probation in more detail.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.245
Okay.

07:33.328 --> 07:38.417
So I get it now. So is it like...?
It's like "good cop, bad cop"?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.544
- Oak and the willow?
- Mr. Williams,

07:40.627 --> 07:44.298
full-time employment and enrollment
in school or vocational training.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.425
These are your basic requirements.

07:46.508 --> 07:50.012
Fail to meet these
and your probation will be in violation.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.805
What does that mean?

07:51.889 --> 07:55.058
That means that you'll go back to jail
for the remainder of your sentence.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.227
So 10 months.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.813
Defacing a city monument's
a serious offense.

07:59.897 --> 08:03.609
Not to mention,
you called the officer a "house Negro,"

08:03.692 --> 08:07.613
resisting arrest and the little stunt
you pulled on the escalator.

08:08.614 --> 08:11.992
- It was the most direct route, bro.
- That's enough.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.079
You can go.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.011
Damn, boy. You all right, baby lungs?

08:34.515 --> 08:36.850
Hey, chronic isn't exactly easy
to get in county, bro.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.102
Yeah, all right.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.940
What's that saying?

08:44.983 --> 08:47.236
You can never go home again.

08:47.319 --> 08:52.741
You ain't gotta go home, but you sure
as hell can't crash on my couch, homo.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.038
You should embroider that
on a throw pillow.

09:12.803 --> 09:17.599
<i>All right, so that's gonna put Dylan
and his beautiful bride up $500 in points.</i>

09:17.683 --> 09:20.853
- No welcome home party?
- There's my sugar plum!

09:20.936 --> 09:23.188
Oh, baby.

09:24.356 --> 09:27.526
- Where the hell you been?
- I told you, I had some stuff to do.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.029
My baby, always scheming up something.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.949
Didn't they feed you nothing in there?
You're thin as a string bean.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.325
What's up, Uncle Charles?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.494
What ever happened
to "three hots and a cot"?

09:37.578 --> 09:39.872
How was the Old Jackson County
Country Club?

09:39.955 --> 09:42.791
I don't wanna hear nothing
about that in here. No way.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.043
You wanna say hi to Papa? Say hi to Papa.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.670
- Hey, big guy.
- Come on.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.131
Where you going? I just got here.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.926
- What's up?
- Have you been smoking?

09:53.010 --> 09:55.888
- No, I told you, I'm done with that.
- Then why are your eyes so red?

09:55.971 --> 09:58.640
I don't know. Seasonal allergies?

09:58.724 --> 10:01.602
Did you read the article I sent you
on marijuana and memory loss?

10:01.685 --> 10:04.271
No. Must have forgot.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.149
I hate to jog your memory,
but Carter's rash is coming back.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.859
What'd the doctor say?

10:08.942 --> 10:12.654
Sydney slept through
the appointment. Tell him.

10:12.738 --> 10:15.532
I took a nap between shifts
because I was working a double.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.868
Selling that phony eye cream
to them old white ladies?

10:17.951 --> 10:21.580
It's not just eye cream.
It's a daily, organic skin care program.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.123
And it's temporary.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.167
Can you run Carter by the clinic later?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.711
I thought you needed to use the car.
Don't you start work tonight?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.713
I'll call them
and tell them I'm running late.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.715
Sounds like Foot Locker all over again.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.717
What did I tell you about smoking
around Carter?

10:33.800 --> 10:37.638
He's way over there.
Besides, they're lights.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.475
Come on, you can drop me off on the way.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.937
- Okay, I need to do my hair first.
- To go to the doctor?

10:45.020 --> 10:47.481
I'm not leaving the house,
looking like this.

10:57.241 --> 10:59.034
Hello!

11:10.087 --> 11:12.130
Yo, open the door!

11:12.214 --> 11:15.509
The dining room's closed!
Drive-through only after 10!

11:15.592 --> 11:19.721
- No, I'm training. Open the door!
- We're closed! Drive-through only!

11:19.805 --> 11:21.640
I'm Jevon. I'm training.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.017
Yo!

11:36.530 --> 11:39.157
Oscar's Chicken N' Fish. This is Stanley.
How may I help you?

11:39.241 --> 11:41.702
Yo, it's Jevon, man.
I'm supposed to be starting tonight.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.788
Oh, hey, how's it going?

11:44.872 --> 11:48.417
<i>I'm getting eaten alive out here, man.
Open the damn door!</i>

11:49.793 --> 11:53.589
Oh, crap. Oh, okay, hang on.
Be right there.

12:00.429 --> 12:03.557
Come on, what'd you think,
I was gonna rob the joint?

12:05.767 --> 12:07.352
Don't answer that.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.771
I'm Jevon.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.566
I'm Stanley.

12:16.028 --> 12:20.073
Well, come on.
We'll get started on your paperwork.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.038
You run this show by yourself?

12:26.121 --> 12:27.664
Pretty much.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.751
Fernando does prep
till around midnight or so,

12:30.834 --> 12:34.463
and then it's a one-man show till 6.

12:34.546 --> 12:35.923
Who's Fernando?

12:36.006 --> 12:38.258
Well, he does prep.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.969
Had to leave early for laser tag.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.015
So...

12:46.433 --> 12:48.519
You got any fast-food experience?

12:49.520 --> 12:51.146
Just eating it.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.232
How about on register?

12:54.316 --> 12:57.152
Nah, man, but I mean, I could count.

12:58.237 --> 12:59.988
So are you a people person?

13:00.989 --> 13:04.284
I thought I already had the job. Shazz
asked me if I could start right away.

13:04.368 --> 13:08.455
So I mean, what, are you like
the unofficial mayor of this place?

13:08.539 --> 13:10.207
I'm the night manager.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.084
What's Shazz, then?

13:12.167 --> 13:14.211
She's the head manager.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.046
What's the difference?

13:16.129 --> 13:20.175
Just the time of day we work.
We're pretty much like equals.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.343
She's not your boss?

13:21.426 --> 13:23.554
Well, we got kind of...

13:23.637 --> 13:26.265
Sort of a co-type of thing.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.935
- It sounds like a simple hierarchy to me.
- Okay.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.815
This is the employee handbook.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.442
It's got all the rules in it. It's got...

13:37.526 --> 13:40.612
It's got cooking temperatures.
It's got closing procedures.

13:40.696 --> 13:45.075
- I like to refer to this as our bible.
- As your bible.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.537
You come up with that by yourself?

13:48.620 --> 13:51.331
Oh, yeah. Sort of.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.876
That's clever.

13:55.127 --> 13:58.714
Okay, now this form here.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.300
This states that you read the handbook.

14:04.303 --> 14:06.096
You got a pen?

14:13.770 --> 14:15.856
You're supposed to read
the handbook first.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.111
You're supposed to read
the handbook first.

14:29.620 --> 14:33.916
So you get three unexcused absences
before you're suspended without pay.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.834
What if the bus is running late?

14:35.918 --> 14:39.630
I've been taking the bus for 38 years,
and I've only been late once.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.467
And that's because the bus driver had
a stroke and crashed into a Jiffy Lube.

14:43.550 --> 14:48.222
And I had to work the entire shift
with a sprained wrist.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.724
Just a regular Willis Reed, huh?

14:50.807 --> 14:54.061
There's a lot more goes into this job
than what's in the handbook.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.439
There's an art to the third shift.
You gotta do a little bit of everything.

14:57.523 --> 15:00.943
You gotta cook and clean
and prep and serve

15:01.026 --> 15:04.446
and improvise.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.659
Once I had to make my own pickles.

15:09.993 --> 15:14.206
And once we hosted a birthday party
and we ran out of ketchup.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.501
- What'd you do?
- I did what I had to.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.380
It wasn't pretty.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.094
This is where the magic happens.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.055
Every sandwich is made right here.

15:30.138 --> 15:33.642
Chicken on the right, fish on the left.
And you don't never mix the two.

15:33.725 --> 15:37.396
- Separate but equal.
- Yeah, sort of.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.316
The chart up here tells you
everything goes on each sandwich.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.193
I try to be conservative with the pickles.

15:43.277 --> 15:46.613
I do three per sandwich.
Yeah, so that's what it's got here.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.537
I... You know, that's about it.
Just follow the rules.

15:54.746 --> 15:58.667
Oh, don't use the stall in the men's room.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.044
There's a bit of a logjam.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.178
Goddamn!

16:30.657 --> 16:32.117
Bro.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.722
You know, I think
honey mustard's our best sauce.

16:53.805 --> 16:57.726
A lot of people like ranch and barbecue.
But I think honey mustard's our best.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.187
Nine times out of 10,
I can tell you what kind of sauce

17:00.270 --> 17:02.147
people are gonna get
even before they order.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.690
Sauce whisperer, huh?

17:03.774 --> 17:06.568
High school and college kids and stuff,
I almost always give ranch.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.487
I call them the ranch generation.

17:09.488 --> 17:12.907
And girls, and especially moms and stuff,
they got fancier taste,

17:12.991 --> 17:15.202
so they almost always get honey mustard.

17:15.285 --> 17:19.289
And old people, I don't know,

17:19.373 --> 17:21.791
they always get barbecue.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.420
I guess that's because
that's all they know.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.466
Yeah. How about you?

17:29.550 --> 17:34.304
I'm also a barbecue kind of guy.
Yeah, I guess it's in my DNA.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.139
Oh, yeah.

17:37.683 --> 17:41.395
- So you went to Albion High, huh?
- Yeah, on occasion.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.940
I was supposed to walk in '71.
That's the year we went to state.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.776
Yeah, I remember seeing
the black-and-white photos in the gym

17:47.860 --> 17:50.404
looking like a bunch
of Jimmy Chitwoods and shit.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.282
That team would've beat the crap out
of the team they got there now.

17:53.365 --> 17:54.950
Are you kidding me, man?

17:55.033 --> 17:58.704
Those goofy, corny motherfuckers.
You're out of your damn mind.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.206
Ain't no wonder you never graduated.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.835
I could have if I wanted to.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.337
Oh, yeah? Then why didn't you?

18:07.421 --> 18:09.298
Because I didn't want to.

18:09.381 --> 18:12.301
So how come you sporting
that class ring, then?

18:12.384 --> 18:13.927
I don't know.

18:14.011 --> 18:17.055
I got it my junior year.
I figured I paid for it.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.267
Motherfucker.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.686
Oh, yeah, you gotta watch them poppers.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.022
Your arms will end up looking
like ground chuck.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.065
Hey, check this out.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.193
They're like battle wounds, huh?

18:31.028 --> 18:33.071
Oh, no.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.714
Oscar's Chicken N' Fish, this is Stanley.
How may I help you?

18:50.797 --> 18:54.051
<i>Hey, it's Jake from Ten Palms Nursing
down in Sarasota.</i>

18:54.134 --> 18:57.137
- <i>Sorry to call so early.</i>
- Hey, how's it going?

18:57.221 --> 18:59.431
<i>Your mom had bit of a scare today.</i>

19:00.432 --> 19:03.185
- Is she all right?
- <i>Everything turned out to be fine.</i>

19:03.268 --> 19:06.104
<i>She seems to have slipped back
into atrial fibrillation.</i>

19:06.188 --> 19:07.397
She slipped in what?

19:07.481 --> 19:11.443
<i>Atrial fibrillation. It's a temporary
and minor heart arrhythmia.</i>

19:12.444 --> 19:13.987
Well, it sounds serious.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.406
<i>The doctor had a look
and he can resolve it for now.</i>

19:16.490 --> 19:19.576
<i>But we're monitoring the situation
just in case.</i>

19:19.660 --> 19:21.662
<i>She's gonna be fine.</i>

19:26.458 --> 19:28.585
You scared the heck out of me there.

19:28.669 --> 19:31.505
Yo, Stanley!
Do you guys use the five-second rule?

19:31.588 --> 19:35.217
No! Hang on, I'll be right there!

19:35.300 --> 19:37.761
<i>Are you still wanting
to move her out next week?</i>

19:38.762 --> 19:41.473
- Yeah, yeah. Hundred percent, yeah.
- <i>Are you sure?</i>

19:41.557 --> 19:43.392
<i>Yeah, no, she needs to be with family.</i>

19:43.475 --> 19:47.521
Why you think I'm driving all the way
down there? To get an apartment together.

19:47.604 --> 19:48.814
<i>We're sorry to see her go.</i>

19:48.897 --> 19:52.192
<i>I'll start processing her transfer papers,
first thing Monday.</i>

19:52.276 --> 19:54.528
<i>You know, wait, hang on. I'll grab her.</i>

19:55.529 --> 19:59.324
- <i>I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>
- All right. Are you sure?

20:05.581 --> 20:07.791
Hey! Sorry about that.

20:07.875 --> 20:11.920
You know, bureaucracy kind of goes
at its own pace, so...

20:12.921 --> 20:15.007
Yeah. Don't we all?

20:19.011 --> 20:20.470
Oh, you...

20:20.554 --> 20:23.348
You actually went to school
with my daughter, didn't you?

20:23.432 --> 20:25.267
Cynthia. Cynthia Kelly?

20:26.894 --> 20:28.896
Oh, yeah, I remember her.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.815
She was in all that shit
with the flags, right?

20:32.900 --> 20:34.359
Yeah, color guard.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.362
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

20:39.406 --> 20:43.493
You... You wrote the column, right,
for the school paper?

20:43.577 --> 20:45.871
- What was it called?
- "Get a Load of This."

20:45.954 --> 20:48.540
Oh, man, yeah. I loved that.
That cracked me up.

20:48.624 --> 20:50.501
It cracked me up. It did.

20:50.584 --> 20:55.172
And you did that... The hit piece
on the local teachers' union, right?

20:55.255 --> 20:56.381
What did you call them?

20:56.465 --> 21:00.302
- "A zit on the face of organized labor."
- Yeah.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.054
Do you still write?

21:02.137 --> 21:04.348
Yeah. Yeah, I try to.

21:04.431 --> 21:08.268
Whenever I have free time.
But I haven't had much lately.

21:08.352 --> 21:09.645
I just had a son, so...

21:10.896 --> 21:13.148
Well, that'll... Yeah.

21:13.232 --> 21:16.151
How's fatherhood wearing on you?

21:17.152 --> 21:22.032
It's good. Yeah, it's going good.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.576
That's good.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.290
So, what's the protocol here?

21:30.374 --> 21:34.670
They are recommending 100 hours
of community service,

21:34.753 --> 21:38.215
monthly reporting,
mandatory employment or schooling,

21:38.298 --> 21:43.762
- and biweekly drug testing, so...
- Like pissing in a cup?

21:45.889 --> 21:49.226
Toxicology screening, yeah.

22:01.488 --> 22:05.242
Hey! Look what I found. You remember this?

22:05.325 --> 22:07.369
Old Stan The Man?

22:07.452 --> 22:08.996
I wasn't too bad in middle school.

22:09.079 --> 22:12.374
You weren't too bad
till they made you wear skates.

22:12.457 --> 22:16.837
- You coming tomorrow? Throw some darts?
- Why, so you can stick me with the bill?

22:16.920 --> 22:18.547
We split that even Stephen.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.550
You guys had like 10 beers.
I had one fricking Mountain Dew.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.760
You had more than one Mountain Dew.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.430
It was free refills!

22:26.513 --> 22:30.767
I still don't see what your big rush is.
Running off with your panties in a bunch.

22:30.851 --> 22:34.605
I told you, the nursing home
I got my mom in is a dump.

22:35.606 --> 22:38.108
Besides, if I don't leave now,
I'll never go.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.403
Nothing here for me anyways.

22:42.404 --> 22:46.491
Suit yourself. Don't pitch a bitch about
missing the gang once you're in Florida.

22:46.575 --> 22:49.286
There's a reason
snowbirds fly back every year.

22:58.504 --> 23:01.673
I thought I asked you not to smoke that
no more in here, Rich.

23:01.757 --> 23:03.175
I thought you left.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.010
No, not till Tuesday.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.137
I thought today was Tuesday.

23:07.221 --> 23:08.972
It's Friday.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.267
My bad!

24:02.568 --> 24:05.946
Jevon? Jevon?

24:08.282 --> 24:09.783
- Yo.
- Chicken tenders.

24:09.867 --> 24:11.159
- Chicken tenders are up.
- What?

24:11.243 --> 24:13.662
- Chicken tenders are up.
- I thought you were on the fryer.

24:13.745 --> 24:16.039
They're right behind you.

24:16.123 --> 24:17.958
Dude, I'm getting crushed here.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.544
Oh, for crying out loud. Are you serious?

24:20.627 --> 24:22.421
Does Fernando ask you
to bread onion rings?

24:22.504 --> 24:24.173
- No, because that's not his job.
- Right.

24:24.256 --> 24:27.467
My job was to follow your instructions.
You told me to wrap the sandwiches.

24:27.551 --> 24:30.053
Yeah, and now I'm telling you
to grab the fryer.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.055
I can't do both, man.

24:32.139 --> 24:34.808
You want me to disobey
your original instructions?

24:34.892 --> 24:36.810
That's a slippery slope
we're heading down.

24:36.894 --> 24:41.732
You like to talk, don't you?
Fernando, can you get the fryer, please?

24:47.029 --> 24:50.574
- Here.
- Don't lift the bag. Jesus.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.326
Excuse me.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.456
There you go. Thank you.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.166
Good night!

25:06.673 --> 25:09.927
You know,
a big part of working here is teamwork.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.762
It says so right in the handbook.

25:11.845 --> 25:15.057
Teamwork? What, are we Crockett and Tubbs?

25:15.140 --> 25:17.976
You told me to wrap the sandwiches,
so that's what I did.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.521
Sometimes you gotta do more
than the bare minimum.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.858
Oh, I definitely plan
on just doing the bare minimum.

25:24.942 --> 25:27.528
Well, what is that supposed to mean?

25:27.611 --> 25:32.741
Do you expect me to bust my ass
for 9.25 an hour, for what?

25:32.824 --> 25:36.078
So some corporate prick can add
a game room onto his McMansion?

25:36.161 --> 25:37.329
- Gary...
- Please.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.164
Gary's not like that.

25:39.248 --> 25:42.292
This place has been here since the '50s.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.421
When people come here,
they expect good food and good service.

25:47.422 --> 25:51.718
- This place is practically a landmark.
- Man, the food here sucks.

25:51.802 --> 25:54.888
Why do you think
everybody goes to McDonald's?

25:57.307 --> 26:01.520
Well, it's put a roof
over my head for 38 years.

26:07.276 --> 26:11.655
I don't have the luxury
to take a fricking stand against the man.

26:12.656 --> 26:15.576
Yo, I'm not gonna be here no 38 years.

26:15.659 --> 26:20.914
And if I'm still here at your age, man,
put me out of my misery, please.

26:22.833 --> 26:26.336
- Hey, I'm going on a break.
- So you asking me or telling me?

26:26.420 --> 26:29.464
Pick one. You're the boss.

26:30.465 --> 26:32.801
Well, don't be lollygagging.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.068
What the hell is this?

26:51.069 --> 26:53.155
- A hamburger?
- It's supposed to be.

26:53.238 --> 26:56.158
That's what it said on the menu.
That's what I paid for.

26:56.241 --> 26:58.785
Too bad it's a goddamn meatsicle!

26:59.786 --> 27:02.623
- Have you bitten into a frozen hamburger?
- Not that I remember, no.

27:02.706 --> 27:05.292
Have you ever driven a half hour home
to three screaming kids

27:05.375 --> 27:07.419
and then bitten into a frozen hamburger?

27:07.503 --> 27:08.837
No.

27:10.005 --> 27:12.132
This shit's about to get fixed right here.

27:12.216 --> 27:14.760
Okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

27:14.843 --> 27:18.388
Just, you know,
drive around the window and...

27:20.807 --> 27:22.726
We'll take care of it. Yeah.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.854
<i>Well, how the hell did that happen?</i>

27:25.938 --> 27:28.482
I don't think he left it
on the grill long enough.

27:28.565 --> 27:31.109
<i>I know that.
I meant, weren't you supervising?</i>

27:31.193 --> 27:33.070
- No, I was on break.
- <i>You was with Dale?</i>

27:33.153 --> 27:34.821
No, not with Dale.

27:34.905 --> 27:38.534
- I just don't think he's a good fit here.
- <i>That isn't up to you.</i>

27:38.617 --> 27:40.494
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

27:40.577 --> 27:43.038
<i>Let me explain something to you, okay?</i>

27:43.121 --> 27:45.624
<i>Training Jevon is your responsibility.</i>

27:45.707 --> 27:49.253
<i>And if you don't,
I'll hold on to your check till you do.</i>

27:49.336 --> 27:51.755
That's just bull, Shazz, and you know it.

27:51.839 --> 27:53.257
<i>You think I give a damn?</i>

27:53.340 --> 27:55.717
- Yeah, but...
- <i>Save the buts, Stanley.</i>

27:55.801 --> 28:00.347
<i>Jevon is your responsibility,
and it's your job to train him.</i>

28:01.348 --> 28:03.058
Well...

28:49.688 --> 28:54.735
She was acting like an entitled brat.
You know, the universe settled the score.

28:54.818 --> 28:58.238
- No, you settled the score.
- Me, as a part of the universe.

28:58.322 --> 29:00.365
What part of the universe is that?

29:00.449 --> 29:03.535
A universe where assholes like her
don't get to shit on whoever they want.

29:03.619 --> 29:05.204
They're not assholes.

29:05.287 --> 29:07.080
They're customers.

29:15.088 --> 29:18.467
God! Doggone it.

29:19.927 --> 29:22.137
You good? Here.

29:29.186 --> 29:33.398
You know, this wasn't my dream job
when I started.

29:33.482 --> 29:36.610
But it's turned out
to be pretty darn good for me.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.490
Okay, you can laugh.

29:42.491 --> 29:44.034
But I like what I do.

29:44.117 --> 29:47.663
It's something I'm good at,
and that means something to me.

29:48.872 --> 29:52.292
Do you know Fernando was a high school
geography teacher in El Salvador

29:52.376 --> 29:56.088
before he had to leave because
of all the shootings and drugs and stuff?

29:57.089 --> 29:59.633
And now he makes twice as much
as he made back there.

30:00.634 --> 30:03.720
Sometimes you just gotta make
your own breaks.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.979
Look at Brett Favre.

30:21.029 --> 30:24.116
<i>Hello! Is anybody there?</i>

30:24.199 --> 30:27.327
<i>Can I get a small fry with extra ketchup?</i>

30:27.411 --> 30:29.204
Oh, come on, Sam.

30:29.288 --> 30:32.833
The drive-through is for vehicles only,
for safety.

30:42.092 --> 30:45.596
I fought in Afghanistan.
Don't tell me about no safety.

30:45.679 --> 30:47.055
No, you didn't.

30:48.056 --> 30:51.310
And how many times I gotta tell you
I can't serve you on foot?

30:51.393 --> 30:55.272
- Fuck this. I wanna talk to a manager.
- Why you always gotta do this?

30:55.355 --> 30:58.150
He said to kick rocks, you booze bag!

30:59.860 --> 31:02.738
So that's how you treat a loyal customer?

31:02.821 --> 31:04.615
A veteran?

31:04.698 --> 31:06.992
You're lucky
there's glass between us, kid.

31:07.075 --> 31:10.996
Otherwise I'd jack you up bigtime.

31:25.093 --> 31:26.678
I wish I could do that.

31:27.679 --> 31:30.182
Just tell somebody off like that.

31:31.683 --> 31:34.269
Yeah, it's definitely an acquired skill.

31:34.353 --> 31:37.564
There's just so many people
I'd just like to say the heck with.

31:37.648 --> 31:39.608
Yeah, it could be useful sometimes.

31:39.691 --> 31:44.071
It's also probably the reason
I'm stuck where I am now,

31:44.154 --> 31:50.911
shooing off drunken lowlifes
and seasoning curly fries, man.

31:52.287 --> 31:55.499
- No offense.
- No.

32:29.783 --> 32:31.994
Well, ain't this a bitch?

32:35.372 --> 32:38.458
Shazz's gonna go through the roof
if she sees this.

33:16.747 --> 33:17.623
Just...

33:27.841 --> 33:29.885
Which way are you headed?

33:29.968 --> 33:33.055
I thought I might catch the 48.

33:34.056 --> 33:34.932
You?

33:36.225 --> 33:37.768
Same.

34:31.989 --> 34:33.407
So how many miles you got on her?

34:34.408 --> 34:36.702
Hundred eighty-something.

34:36.784 --> 34:40.246
Used to be my girlfriend's,
but she'd just as soon take the bus.

34:41.248 --> 34:43.125
Is she reliable?

34:44.168 --> 34:45.252
My girlfriend?

34:46.253 --> 34:47.880
No, the...

34:49.130 --> 34:51.592
I'm not an expert but yeah.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.428
I don't see why not.

34:55.888 --> 34:57.681
Where'd you say you was going?

34:57.764 --> 34:59.433
Sarasota.

35:00.517 --> 35:02.269
It's in Florida.

35:03.270 --> 35:05.522
My mom lives down there.

35:11.111 --> 35:12.487
So I can't afford no lemon.

35:13.488 --> 35:16.158
Hey, what you see is what you get.

35:25.292 --> 35:27.294
Think I can take it for a spin
around the block?

35:28.295 --> 35:31.757
You got a driver's license
I can hang on to?

35:35.302 --> 35:37.262
I left it at work.

35:40.974 --> 35:42.559
All right.

35:42.643 --> 35:45.521
But it ain't got no insurance,
so if you break it, you buy it.

35:45.604 --> 35:48.649
Okay. It's a deal.

36:19.721 --> 36:21.223
Okay.

36:21.306 --> 36:23.892
Let's stretch
this pony's legs a little bit.

36:23.976 --> 36:25.978
What do you say?

36:39.116 --> 36:41.660
Okay, okay.

36:43.662 --> 36:45.205
Learn how do drive, asshole!

36:45.289 --> 36:47.124
Stop.

36:47.207 --> 36:49.126
Road hog!

36:56.383 --> 36:58.051
Oh, God.

36:58.135 --> 36:59.928
Oh, God.

37:00.929 --> 37:02.514
Just defensive driving.

37:03.515 --> 37:05.601
Read the darn manual.

37:06.602 --> 37:08.145
God.

37:34.505 --> 37:36.465
What the hell?!

37:37.966 --> 37:39.551
Copy.

37:46.016 --> 37:49.186
He says he's willing
to let it slide for 500.

37:50.562 --> 37:52.064
In terms of the bus,

37:52.147 --> 37:55.150
the city will be in touch with you,
but it doesn't look that bad.

37:55.234 --> 37:57.194
Five hundred bucks? Five...?

37:57.277 --> 37:59.488
That's like half the price
of the whole car.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.865
It's either that or buy it at full price.

38:02.866 --> 38:05.661
Well, what good's a car
with only three doors?

38:05.744 --> 38:08.830
It'll make getting in and out
a whole lot easier.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.209
It could have been worse.

38:12.292 --> 38:15.170
Another half second, it could have
been you instead of that door.

38:15.254 --> 38:18.799
In terms of driving without a license,
since you got a clean record

38:18.882 --> 38:22.261
and you seem like a stand-up guy,
I'm not gonna charge you.

38:22.344 --> 38:24.847
Next time I won't be so forgiving.
Understand?

38:24.930 --> 38:26.431
Yes, sir.

38:37.025 --> 38:38.652
Enjoy.

38:46.660 --> 38:49.079
I'm not complaining about the job.

38:49.162 --> 38:50.998
I'm just stating facts.

38:51.081 --> 38:54.126
Fried food is the number one cause
for high cholesterol rates

38:54.209 --> 38:55.919
among African Americans.

38:56.003 --> 38:58.964
- I'm too tired for it, Jevon.
- Too tired for what?

38:59.047 --> 39:00.507
This.

39:00.591 --> 39:03.594
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one
carrying my weight around here.

39:03.677 --> 39:05.262
Carrying your weight?

39:05.345 --> 39:09.016
Syd, I'm wearing a name tag and a visor.

39:09.099 --> 39:11.810
Yeah, until next week,
when you show up high as a kite

39:11.894 --> 39:16.732
or get fired for lecturing your boss
on the alienation of labor.

39:19.067 --> 39:21.737
I'm thinking about moving back
with my parents.

39:22.738 --> 39:24.281
What?

39:25.282 --> 39:28.827
- That's like an hour away.
- Well, what choice do I have?

39:28.911 --> 39:30.454
Sleeping on your mom's air mattress

39:30.537 --> 39:32.372
and returning pop bottles
to make ends meet.

39:32.456 --> 39:33.540
It's temporary.

39:33.624 --> 39:35.250
That's what you said about the last place.

39:35.334 --> 39:36.376
And it was.

39:37.544 --> 39:39.630
Everything is temporary with you, Jevon.

39:39.713 --> 39:44.676
I'm done moving from place to place.
I'm done being broke. I'm done.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.887
Yeah, you mentioned that.

39:50.307 --> 39:53.602
- So, what about Carter, then?
- What about Carter?

39:53.685 --> 39:56.939
You realize you've hardly been home
since you got out, right?

39:57.022 --> 39:58.273
Okay.

39:58.357 --> 40:00.901
So that's what this is about.

40:00.984 --> 40:03.946
- I told you I was at Brandon's.
- Yeah. Writing?

40:04.029 --> 40:06.698
- Clearing your head, right?
- Yes!

40:07.699 --> 40:10.118
- Maybe.
- Don't bullshit me, Jevon.

40:10.202 --> 40:13.539
- You haven't picked up a pen in months.
- It's not as easy as picking up a pen!

40:13.622 --> 40:15.832
- Then what is it?
- I don't know!

40:15.916 --> 40:19.753
But I can't figure it out
with all this shit hanging over my head!

40:23.423 --> 40:25.801
Is that what we are to you?

40:27.845 --> 40:29.596
I didn't mean that.

40:31.348 --> 40:32.850
Now, are you sure?

40:33.851 --> 40:37.604
You've barely looked in Carter's direction
since you got out.

40:38.605 --> 40:41.567
Jevon, I gave up everything
to try and do this together.

40:41.650 --> 40:44.820
I gave up track.
I sacrificed my scholarship.

40:44.903 --> 40:47.781
I'm here, aren't I?

40:47.865 --> 40:49.908
So, what are you talking about?

40:51.577 --> 40:54.413
Just being here is not enough.

41:04.423 --> 41:06.550
I don't know
how I'm even gonna get down there.

41:06.633 --> 41:08.844
I barely had enough dough
to make it before the accident.

41:08.927 --> 41:12.890
- What about flying?
- Flying? What, are you out of your tree?

41:12.973 --> 41:16.101
Well, Rusty and my sister flew down
to North Carolina

41:16.185 --> 41:17.686
for that civil war thing.

41:17.769 --> 41:19.521
- They said it wasn't too bad.
- No way.

41:19.605 --> 41:21.857
- I'm not that cuckoo.
- I'm just saying.

41:21.940 --> 41:24.359
You could stick around here
a couple more months

41:24.443 --> 41:26.361
and save up a little more dough.

41:27.362 --> 41:32.159
No, I already told the nursing home
my mom would be out of there by next week.

41:32.242 --> 41:35.078
- They probably already gave her bed away.
- What about your brother?

41:35.162 --> 41:36.955
That prick's got more money than the pope.

41:37.039 --> 41:38.916
No way. That's the last thing I wanna do.

41:39.917 --> 41:41.418
- What's up?
- Hey, Jevon.

41:42.419 --> 41:44.505
Dale, this is Jevon.

41:46.173 --> 41:48.967
Dale's been giving me some driving tips.

41:49.051 --> 41:52.596
All I'm saying, they're not gonna throw
your mom out on the street.

41:52.679 --> 41:54.640
It don't work that way, you know.

41:54.723 --> 41:57.392
Plus, taking care
of old people ain't easy.

41:57.476 --> 41:59.561
You ever changed a diaper?

41:59.645 --> 42:02.564
But with a full-size deuce in it,
not a kiddie shit.

42:04.066 --> 42:05.526
No, not yet.

42:05.609 --> 42:08.028
I shit myself once.

42:08.111 --> 42:12.407
Band class. Sixth grade. French horn.
Went for the high note, boom.

42:12.491 --> 42:14.284
Sauce.

42:16.119 --> 42:20.791
Cleaning that up was pretty bad.
And that was my own. Follow me?

42:28.006 --> 42:30.759
Oh, shit.

42:32.719 --> 42:34.263
What up, Jevon?

42:34.346 --> 42:36.014
What's up, bro-bro?

42:37.015 --> 42:41.311
- You moonlighting or something?
- Nah, man. I'm just covering for a homey.

42:42.312 --> 42:45.566
- What up, Big Stan?
- You know Jevon?

42:46.567 --> 42:50.821
Well, starting next week,
he's gonna be head honcho around here.

42:50.904 --> 42:52.739
Honcho?

42:53.740 --> 42:55.576
Yeah, Monday's my last shift.

42:55.659 --> 42:58.203
I'm heading down to Margaritaville.

42:58.287 --> 43:00.247
Hey.

43:01.290 --> 43:02.791
Yeah.

43:03.834 --> 43:05.294
Yeah.

43:06.503 --> 43:10.174
- It's 8.60.
- Don't look like no side hustle to me.

43:11.175 --> 43:13.886
Boy look like
he slaying hush puppies.

43:13.969 --> 43:16.889
- What kind of sauce do you want, man?
- Barbecue.

43:25.397 --> 43:26.899
I don't know if it's these onions

43:26.982 --> 43:29.693
or this shit going down in Flint
that's making me cry.

43:29.776 --> 43:32.404
Why don't you try wearing gloves?

43:32.487 --> 43:34.072
It won't burn as bad.

43:34.156 --> 43:37.034
It's transferred mostly through the hands.

43:40.454 --> 43:43.165
You know, the whole thing reeks
of a failing autocracy.

43:43.248 --> 43:44.875
Yeah, I know.

43:44.958 --> 43:47.169
So try putting on the gloves.

43:47.252 --> 43:50.422
Let me ask you something.
How much you make an hour?

43:57.054 --> 43:58.805
Thirteen fifty.

43:58.889 --> 44:01.266
Thirteen fifty?

44:01.350 --> 44:03.143
After 38 fucking years?

44:03.227 --> 44:06.522
- That ain't bad change.
- Yeah, for a crossing guard.

44:07.564 --> 44:08.857
I started at 3.10.

44:10.484 --> 44:11.735
Three ten?

44:12.736 --> 44:15.656
Damn, man.
Have you ever heard of inflation?

44:15.739 --> 44:19.201
My cousin manages at a Hardee's
and makes 15.75 an hour.

44:19.284 --> 44:21.787
And she's, like,
the least responsible person I know.

44:21.870 --> 44:26.166
Do you realize how much this place
has profited off of your crotchety ass

44:26.250 --> 44:29.127
for the past 30-whatever years?

44:29.211 --> 44:32.756
They've literally made hundreds
of thousands of dollars off your back.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.008
Did they ever share any of it with you?

44:35.092 --> 44:37.427
- Well, no, but...
- Yeah.

44:37.511 --> 44:38.679
See?

44:38.762 --> 44:41.682
See, man, that's what I'm saying, man.

44:49.773 --> 44:51.775
Well, that's your opinion.

45:01.076 --> 45:02.494
Hey.

45:05.372 --> 45:07.291
It's my own special recipe.

45:08.292 --> 45:10.711
I call it The Stan-wich.

45:14.256 --> 45:15.716
This looks legit, man.

45:15.799 --> 45:18.510
Just don't tell Shazz
you're eating on the clock.

45:19.511 --> 45:22.181
Prep's wrapped. I'm taking off.

45:22.264 --> 45:25.601
Listen, Fernando, can you empty
the grease traps on your way out?

45:25.684 --> 45:27.603
They're starting to reek.

45:38.614 --> 45:41.533
So how much longer
until we gotta prep breakfast?

45:43.368 --> 45:45.287
We got a while.

45:46.413 --> 45:50.959
I always say, the first half
of graveyard's fighting off drunks.

45:52.252 --> 45:54.796
The second half's fighting off boredom.

45:58.509 --> 46:00.010
You're gonna start talking again,
aren't you?

46:00.093 --> 46:01.470
No.

46:07.476 --> 46:09.019
You're not following through.

46:09.102 --> 46:10.187
Well, wait...

46:10.270 --> 46:12.397
You gotta bend your knees
and follow through.

46:13.398 --> 46:16.485
Bend your knees. Squeeze your core.

46:19.613 --> 46:21.615
That's game. That's game, baby.

46:21.698 --> 46:23.575
Okay, rematch. We got a rematch.

46:23.659 --> 46:26.036
All right. If you wanna hold another L,
that's on you.

46:26.119 --> 46:28.330
I do. Yeah, I do.

46:29.873 --> 46:32.793
Did you see that story
about that dude in Tampa

46:32.876 --> 46:35.546
who got high on bath salts,
ate his neighbor's face?

46:35.629 --> 46:36.672
Oh, no.

46:36.755 --> 46:38.924
Or the coroner in Coral Gables,

46:39.007 --> 46:43.136
they found like 50 frozen dicks
in his freezer, man.

46:43.220 --> 46:45.013
Florida is bonkers, man.

46:45.097 --> 46:47.516
Now you're giving me the willies.

46:48.809 --> 46:49.768
I go first.

46:49.852 --> 46:52.229
- Fifty dicks.
- Frozen.

46:52.312 --> 46:54.439
Hey, what's this?

46:54.523 --> 46:57.776
My probation officer,
in all of her white liberal guilt,

46:57.860 --> 46:59.987
suggested I sign up for community college.

47:01.321 --> 47:04.658
- What for?
- My thoughts exactly, man.

47:05.659 --> 47:09.204
I don't know why anybody would pay
some stiff 50 grand a year

47:09.288 --> 47:11.498
for some shit
that they can learn on the Internet.

47:11.582 --> 47:14.960
I don't think college can teach
a real writer shit.

47:15.043 --> 47:17.296
I think experience comes at a cost,

47:17.379 --> 47:20.632
but it sure ain't a college tuition.

47:21.633 --> 47:24.386
I don't know.
I think college sounds like fun.

47:24.469 --> 47:26.805
You ever see <i>Animal House?</i>

47:31.852 --> 47:33.061
Bend your knees.

47:33.145 --> 47:34.855
Would you...?

47:36.648 --> 47:37.900
Jevon, I...

47:37.983 --> 47:42.446
This... That's it. I'm done.
I'm done. You won't stop talking.

47:50.245 --> 47:51.455
What do you wanna drink?

47:52.456 --> 47:55.292
Sierra Mist, please.

48:11.391 --> 48:14.144
So, what do you write?
Like, raps and stuff?

48:16.396 --> 48:18.148
Do I look like a rapper?

48:20.901 --> 48:22.694
Nah, man.

48:23.779 --> 48:24.947
Journals.

48:25.948 --> 48:28.617
Blogs. Political commentary.

48:28.700 --> 48:30.953
I used to have a column
in the school newspaper.

48:31.036 --> 48:32.371
- You did?
- Yeah.

48:32.454 --> 48:34.456
I used to want to be a writer,

48:34.540 --> 48:39.503
but inspiration is hard to come by
on an empty stomach, so...

48:40.629 --> 48:42.339
Who said that?

48:47.344 --> 48:48.887
You were class of '71?

48:48.971 --> 48:50.681
Should've been.

48:52.266 --> 48:54.059
Were you there when they...?

48:55.060 --> 48:57.521
When they killed that Ricky Powell dude?

48:58.522 --> 49:00.691
That Black kid they beat down
behind the school?

49:02.150 --> 49:04.987
Boy, I haven't heard that name
in a long time.

49:07.739 --> 49:11.118
No, I wasn't right there.
But I remember all the hoopla about it.

49:12.119 --> 49:14.121
You know the guys that did it?

49:15.831 --> 49:19.084
Yeah, I knew them.
Walt was in my shop class.

49:20.169 --> 49:22.754
I remember
my grandpa telling me stories about it.

49:23.755 --> 49:25.048
Plus, all the...

49:26.049 --> 49:28.510
The plaques
and everything around school...

49:28.594 --> 49:29.845
Yeah.

49:31.722 --> 49:33.765
Those dudes got away with murder and shit.

49:33.849 --> 49:36.560
Well, yeah, you know,
who knows what happened?

49:36.643 --> 49:40.397
Those guys' lives were ruined
because of that trial. So...

49:41.815 --> 49:43.066
Wait, you think...?

49:43.150 --> 49:45.485
You think that their lives were ruined?

49:45.569 --> 49:47.404
The only reason
that dude is not coming back

49:47.487 --> 49:49.072
is because of the color of his skin.

49:49.156 --> 49:51.408
Oh, God, here we go. Why do you...?

49:51.491 --> 49:54.119
Why do you guys always have
to play the race card?

49:54.203 --> 49:56.914
What the...? Somebody says
something you don't agree with,

49:56.997 --> 49:58.999
it's like, "Oh, yeah,
it's Black and white."

49:59.082 --> 50:02.503
Okay. So now Black people are to blame
for institutionalized racism?

50:02.586 --> 50:04.463
Well, heck if I know.

50:04.546 --> 50:06.882
But nobody ever give me nothing.

50:06.965 --> 50:10.594
You know, you guys just keep talking
about all this,

50:10.677 --> 50:12.304
you know, white privilege. Jesus!

50:12.387 --> 50:14.598
Just stop. Just stop.

50:14.681 --> 50:18.310
You know, all the hidden benefits
of being white...

50:20.646 --> 50:24.233
I worked my butt off for everything I got.

50:24.316 --> 50:27.611
Yeah, with the benefit of being white.

50:28.612 --> 50:30.781
That's just freaking baloney.

50:30.864 --> 50:34.326
That's just baloney and you know it.

50:34.409 --> 50:36.328
Yeah, baloney.

52:05.709 --> 52:08.629
Yo, we got any more markers?

52:09.630 --> 52:12.758
- What's the matter with that one?
- It doesn't write.

52:12.841 --> 52:15.719
- Did you try shaking it?
- What do you think?

52:15.802 --> 52:18.680
- Did you try wetting the end?
- Dude, it's out of ink.

52:40.118 --> 52:42.454
<i>Let me get a number four meal.</i>

52:42.538 --> 52:44.873
<i>With a Pepsi. Diet.</i>

52:50.963 --> 52:53.340
Y'all don't have frozen custard anymore?

52:54.341 --> 52:56.176
Not since high school.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.678
I still get a family discount?

52:58.804 --> 53:01.181
What do you want, Jack?

53:01.265 --> 53:03.350
I just got off the phone with Mom.

53:03.433 --> 53:05.143
I thought she was just talking nonsense,

53:05.227 --> 53:07.688
but then I ran into Dale
at the Dollar General.

53:07.771 --> 53:11.775
You know, I still can't believe
that you stuck her in that dump.

53:11.859 --> 53:14.570
- We both agreed to it.
- You said it was top-notch.

53:14.653 --> 53:18.156
- It's more than she ever did for us.
- She worked her hump off for us.

53:18.240 --> 53:22.202
The woman worked in a plastics plant
and was drunk half her life.

53:22.286 --> 53:24.413
No wonder she hardly knows where she is.

53:25.956 --> 53:29.585
I don't know what my going down there's
got anything to do with you anyways.

53:29.668 --> 53:32.045
Because we both know
who's gonna have to clean things up

53:32.129 --> 53:34.214
after your little plan goes kaput.

53:35.215 --> 53:37.634
You're taking up more than you can handle.

53:37.718 --> 53:39.970
Like you would know
how much I could handle.

53:40.053 --> 53:42.431
Yeah, I'd know a lot better than anybody.

53:46.059 --> 53:46.977
It's on me.

53:51.356 --> 53:52.566
No.

53:52.649 --> 53:55.652
Diana doesn't want me
eating that shit no more.

53:56.778 --> 53:59.239
I know you're trying
to do the right thing here.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.868
Maybe it's time to let go.

54:25.432 --> 54:27.226
That's your brother?

54:29.686 --> 54:31.146
Yeah.

54:32.147 --> 54:33.732
Man.

54:35.234 --> 54:38.237
He's been on top of me since day one.

54:52.042 --> 54:54.503
Sounds a lot like my mom.

54:55.921 --> 54:59.967
If she were any more smothering,
I might die from asphyxiation.

55:01.176 --> 55:04.054
It's a wonder I made it this far
with my sanity intact, man.

55:05.055 --> 55:06.557
Really?

55:09.643 --> 55:12.563
I'd do dang near anything for my mom.

55:12.646 --> 55:16.316
It's because of her, I am where I am now.

55:18.610 --> 55:20.612
Yeah, me too.

55:32.040 --> 55:34.376
I was in the parking lot...

55:36.211 --> 55:39.214
when they beat up Ricky
that day in school.

55:45.721 --> 55:47.347
Shit.

55:49.266 --> 55:51.226
Were you there when he died?

55:52.269 --> 55:55.147
As soon as it started,
me and Dale took off.

56:01.570 --> 56:04.489
I wasn't any further away than that fence.

56:10.537 --> 56:12.206
Why didn't you say anything in court?

56:17.961 --> 56:19.963
No one asked.

56:25.093 --> 56:28.013
Shazz is here, Stanley.
She's asking for you.

56:39.149 --> 56:40.859
- Stanley?
- Yes? Yup.

56:40.943 --> 56:43.320
- Have you seen my spare key?
- Which one?

56:43.403 --> 56:45.864
The set that I keep here.
Thus the name spare.

56:45.948 --> 56:47.199
Not lately, no.

56:47.282 --> 56:49.660
When do you remember seeing it last?

56:49.743 --> 56:52.287
Come on. I'm locked out of my house.
This is important.

56:52.371 --> 56:54.873
Not off the top of my head,
I don't remember.

56:54.957 --> 56:56.333
Okay.

56:57.334 --> 57:00.379
Did you at least train Jevon
how to do the night deposits?

57:00.462 --> 57:02.256
- Last night, yeah.
- Okay, good.

57:02.339 --> 57:05.592
- Could I get my check?
- After you finish training Jevon.

57:05.676 --> 57:06.969
Are you serious?

57:07.970 --> 57:10.347
- What's up?
- What's up is my patience.

57:10.430 --> 57:12.307
I can't find my keys.

57:12.391 --> 57:14.309
How you doing on your training?
You feel good?

57:14.393 --> 57:17.437
Yeah. Transformation's almost complete.

57:17.521 --> 57:20.440
- Only thing missing is my paper hat.
- This is such bull, Shazz.

57:20.524 --> 57:23.735
Company policy. Don't start with me.
What do you want me to say?

57:23.819 --> 57:25.445
Show me where it says that
in the handbook.

57:25.529 --> 57:26.697
You wanna know where it is?

57:26.780 --> 57:29.283
It's under this new section
called "Because I Said So."

57:29.366 --> 57:31.910
- I read that chapter.
- It's a good one, right?

57:31.994 --> 57:33.620
Are you messing with me?

57:33.704 --> 57:36.498
I talked to Gary.
It's a joint determination.

57:36.582 --> 57:40.711
Joint determination? Okay.
So now you wanna use fancy words.

57:40.794 --> 57:41.962
Oh, my God.

57:42.045 --> 57:45.799
You're lucky I just don't shit
on the floor and hit the door.

57:45.883 --> 57:47.843
The fuck? Come on. Calm down.

57:47.926 --> 57:51.096
No. No. Because I'm sick of this crap.

57:51.180 --> 57:54.808
I've done everything you guys asked me to,
and I never complain about nothing.

57:54.892 --> 57:58.395
And all I'm asking is for you
to treat me fair.

58:00.647 --> 58:03.317
- Treat you fair?
- Yeah.

58:06.695 --> 58:10.073
What do you know
about being treated unfairly, Stanley?

58:15.829 --> 58:17.331
Well...

58:19.124 --> 58:19.958
Okay.

58:20.959 --> 58:22.878
Treat you unfairly.

58:22.961 --> 58:25.255
Have a good evening, y'all.

58:33.180 --> 58:34.848
The heck with this place.

58:34.932 --> 58:37.059
Thirty-eight years for what?

58:38.060 --> 58:39.728
Take it easy, man.

58:39.811 --> 58:41.730
Don't go full Kaczynski on us.

58:41.813 --> 58:46.193
I knew you'd take her side.
It just... God, it figures.

58:46.276 --> 58:47.319
I'm not taking her side.

58:47.402 --> 58:50.364
I'm just saying, like it or not,
Shazz is at the top of the heap.

58:50.447 --> 58:52.699
You said so yourself.

58:54.952 --> 58:55.786
All right.

58:56.787 --> 59:00.123
- I'm gonna go take care of the bathroom.
- No. No, it's fine. I'll do it.

59:00.207 --> 59:01.583
Nah, it's all good.

59:01.667 --> 59:04.378
Just consider it
a final initiation ritual.

59:05.379 --> 59:08.298
- Hey, where's the plunger at?
- Where do you think it is?

59:08.382 --> 59:10.133
It's in the bathroom.

59:32.656 --> 59:36.243
- You got an extra smoke?
- I'm taking my 15.

59:55.429 --> 59:57.890
Are these the ones you want, man?

59:59.057 --> 1:00:01.018
That explains that stinking-ass breath.

1:00:01.101 --> 1:00:03.854
Nasty as hell, man.
What's wrong with you, eating those?

1:00:03.937 --> 1:00:06.106
You gonna buy something or what?

1:00:07.107 --> 1:00:10.110
- The fuck you just say to me?
- I said, are you gonna buy something?

1:00:10.194 --> 1:00:12.362
Some of us have to get back to work.

1:00:13.363 --> 1:00:17.659
You got a lot of nerve, old school.
You best watch yourself in these streets.

1:00:17.743 --> 1:00:20.078
Yeah, all right. Whatever that means.

1:00:20.162 --> 1:00:22.539
Would you like to try
our new Big Black Cherry Super Freeze?

1:00:22.623 --> 1:00:23.665
No, just the usual.

1:00:23.749 --> 1:00:27.002
- I'll kick your old ass, grandpa.
- Kick his old ass. Grandpa.

1:00:27.085 --> 1:00:29.796
Why are you serving this clown?
Look at him.

1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:32.716
- What the fuck you got on, my guy?
- Hey, bozo. Right.

1:00:33.717 --> 1:00:34.885
Work clothes.

1:00:34.968 --> 1:00:37.596
You've been working a long time,
you should retire too.

1:00:38.764 --> 1:00:41.099
That dude's old as hell.

1:02:18.488 --> 1:02:21.950
Dude, I'm getting killed over here, man.
Where you been?

1:02:25.287 --> 1:02:27.497
What the hell happened to you?

1:02:27.581 --> 1:02:30.501
My life was a whole lot easier
before I met you.

1:02:31.627 --> 1:02:34.546
- What are you talking about?
- I'm a lot of things,

1:02:34.630 --> 1:02:37.090
but I ain't wrong about that one.

1:02:46.183 --> 1:02:47.726
How did they know?

1:02:48.810 --> 1:02:52.481
- How did who know what?
- Don't play dumb.

1:02:53.774 --> 1:02:56.443
You making it a little hard, man.

1:02:56.527 --> 1:03:00.155
How did them guys know
that I had all that money?

1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:02.741
Money?

1:03:07.204 --> 1:03:11.250
- Wait, what is that supposed to mean?
- Who told them?

1:03:11.333 --> 1:03:12.751
Can I place an order?

1:03:12.835 --> 1:03:15.796
Sorry, ma'am, I'll be right with you.

1:03:17.589 --> 1:03:22.219
What, are you concussed or something, man?
How the hell is this my fault?

1:03:23.428 --> 1:03:26.765
I worked my butt off my whole life,
and you just float through life,

1:03:26.849 --> 1:03:28.392
doing as little as possible.

1:03:28.475 --> 1:03:30.853
Who do you think's gotta pick up
the slack?

1:03:30.936 --> 1:03:33.105
Is this what you call floating?

1:03:34.982 --> 1:03:36.733
You honestly think

1:03:36.817 --> 1:03:40.028
that this whole freeloading universe
is out to get you?

1:03:40.112 --> 1:03:43.657
It's all one vast conspiracy
to bring Stan The Man down.

1:03:43.740 --> 1:03:46.326
Conspiracy, huh? There you go again.

1:03:47.327 --> 1:03:49.204
Man, you act like some fucking hero.

1:03:50.205 --> 1:03:54.710
You spent your entire life doing a job
that some trained monkey could do.

1:03:56.712 --> 1:03:59.423
You're stuck in here, same as me.

1:04:00.424 --> 1:04:04.052
So don't act like I'm the one to blame.

1:06:01.128 --> 1:06:07.718
You know, they start managers out
at Hardee's at $15 an hour.

1:06:08.719 --> 1:06:11.388
- Screw Oscar's. Yeah.
- That's the attitude. Screw them.

1:06:12.389 --> 1:06:14.850
Did you file a police report
on the mugging?

1:06:14.933 --> 1:06:16.768
Nah. What's the point?

1:06:16.852 --> 1:06:21.190
Damn thugs. Got nothing better to do
than make life hell for the rest of us.

1:06:21.273 --> 1:06:23.817
- You talked to your mom?
- Yeah.

1:06:23.901 --> 1:06:26.695
You know, she didn't even remember
I was coming.

1:06:32.784 --> 1:06:37.581
So you're actually gonna leave me
in this shithole solo, huh?

1:06:38.582 --> 1:06:40.709
- It's not a shithole.
- Yeah, it is.

1:06:40.792 --> 1:06:43.212
But it's our shithole.

1:06:46.006 --> 1:06:48.008
Well, I guess this is:

1:06:48.091 --> 1:06:50.802
Hasta la vista, baby.

1:06:52.387 --> 1:06:55.057
Yeah, just don't forget
about us regular joes

1:06:55.140 --> 1:06:59.811
when you're down on the beach
sipping piña coladas.

1:07:27.881 --> 1:07:30.551
Jevon, you got a sec?

1:07:37.391 --> 1:07:39.059
Fuck.

1:07:43.689 --> 1:07:45.607
Okay, so...

1:07:46.608 --> 1:07:49.278
I don't like
to beat around the bush, so...

1:07:49.361 --> 1:07:52.114
The drawer showed up short last night.

1:07:53.615 --> 1:07:57.035
And the only two people
who know the combination are you

1:07:57.119 --> 1:07:58.245
and Stanley.

1:07:59.246 --> 1:08:00.622
What does Stanley say?

1:08:00.706 --> 1:08:03.041
I got off the phone with him
this afternoon.

1:08:03.125 --> 1:08:06.128
- Does he think I did it?
- I did not say that.

1:08:07.129 --> 1:08:11.383
I may not be employee of the month,
but I never stole nothing from nobody.

1:08:11.466 --> 1:08:14.303
I did everything by the book,
like you said.

1:08:14.386 --> 1:08:17.598
Like the woman who almost lost her tooth
on the cheeseburger?

1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:19.265
Shazz, it was an accident.

1:08:21.310 --> 1:08:23.645
They're pre-made patties.

1:08:23.729 --> 1:08:26.607
It takes actual effort to undercook them.

1:08:26.689 --> 1:08:28.274
It was a mistake.

1:08:29.276 --> 1:08:31.737
Look, I don't know who did what.

1:08:32.738 --> 1:08:35.908
And you're not giving me much either.
So I talked to Gary...

1:08:36.908 --> 1:08:39.328
And you know the rest.
I'm sure you understand.

1:08:39.411 --> 1:08:41.622
Yeah, that I need this job.

1:08:42.622 --> 1:08:45.959
I'm not gonna get the cops involved, okay?

1:08:46.042 --> 1:08:48.170
Yeah, but what about Stanley though?

1:08:48.252 --> 1:08:50.380
How you know it wasn't him?

1:09:00.140 --> 1:09:01.140
I'm sorry.

1:09:04.185 --> 1:09:06.104
Yeah, me too.

1:09:08.774 --> 1:09:12.109
I'm sorry I ever gave two shits
about this place.

1:09:27.876 --> 1:09:30.170
You're home early.

1:09:31.921 --> 1:09:33.841
Everything all right?

1:09:34.841 --> 1:09:36.718
Jevon.

1:10:00.033 --> 1:10:01.743
Guys.

1:10:13.463 --> 1:10:15.340
Gary left this this morning.

1:10:16.341 --> 1:10:18.177
He said it was a token
of his appreciation.

1:10:24.266 --> 1:10:25.684
Where's Jevon?

1:10:26.894 --> 1:10:28.187
Where do you think he is?

1:10:28.270 --> 1:10:31.106
I mean, if you didn't lift the money,
someone did.

1:10:31.190 --> 1:10:34.318
Doesn't take Columbo
to figure that out, right?

1:10:35.319 --> 1:10:37.654
Well, what'd he say
when you asked him about it?

1:10:38.822 --> 1:10:40.365
He denied it.

1:10:40.449 --> 1:10:44.036
And then he begs me
to let him keep his job.

1:10:44.119 --> 1:10:46.288
The usual combo.

1:10:47.539 --> 1:10:50.167
You know, it's a shame though. I really...

1:10:50.250 --> 1:10:53.170
I'm really sorry
that it didn't work out between you two.

1:10:53.253 --> 1:10:54.463
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

1:10:54.546 --> 1:10:56.965
Yeah, because I really wanted it
to work out.

1:10:57.049 --> 1:10:59.676
He doesn't seem like a bad kid.

1:11:02.846 --> 1:11:05.057
Anyways, Fernando's going to fill in

1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:08.352
until we find someone
more suitable, unless...

1:11:09.353 --> 1:11:10.896
you know, you've...

1:11:10.979 --> 1:11:12.773
You've changed your mind.

1:11:13.982 --> 1:11:15.359
- No.
- No?

1:11:15.442 --> 1:11:18.320
No, I think my time here's pretty much up.

1:11:18.403 --> 1:11:19.988
Yeah.

1:11:20.989 --> 1:11:22.699
Yeah.

1:11:40.175 --> 1:11:41.593
There you go.

1:11:41.677 --> 1:11:44.513
- Have fun in Sarasota, okay?
- Thanks.

1:11:44.596 --> 1:11:46.139
All right.

1:11:46.223 --> 1:11:47.933
Thanks, Shazz.

1:11:55.899 --> 1:11:56.859
Bye, buddy.

1:11:57.860 --> 1:11:59.611
Adiós, Stanley.

1:12:54.249 --> 1:12:57.669
All right, so I got some shitty news.

1:12:57.753 --> 1:13:00.088
I got let go from Oscar's last night.

1:13:01.089 --> 1:13:02.716
Seriously?

1:13:02.799 --> 1:13:05.802
Apparently, there was some money missing
from the safe or something,

1:13:05.886 --> 1:13:08.138
and they pinned it on me.

1:13:09.181 --> 1:13:10.849
Jevon...

1:13:10.933 --> 1:13:13.519
Look, I know how it looks.

1:13:13.602 --> 1:13:16.647
You know I have to report this, right?

1:13:25.781 --> 1:13:30.077
You know, this isn't fun for me.
I mean, this is... This is exhausting.

1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:32.204
Oh, I am so sorry.

1:13:32.287 --> 1:13:33.789
You're exhausted?

1:13:33.872 --> 1:13:35.582
Well, get a load of this.

1:13:35.666 --> 1:13:38.669
I just had to borrow a buck fifty
from my mom for bus fare.

1:13:38.752 --> 1:13:42.589
The air mattress I'm sleeping on at home
is about as comfortable as a pool raft.

1:13:42.673 --> 1:13:47.094
And my ex-girlfriend
and my son just moved to Grand Rapids.

1:13:47.177 --> 1:13:49.221
So you think you're drained?

1:13:55.394 --> 1:13:59.314
Listen. Jevon, I wanna help you, okay?

1:13:59.398 --> 1:14:01.233
I really do. But I...

1:14:02.234 --> 1:14:04.653
I can't help you
if you're not gonna help yourself.

1:14:09.700 --> 1:14:11.577
I don't know. I...

1:14:12.953 --> 1:14:17.457
Maybe serving out your sentence is
just the best thing for you right now.

1:14:19.710 --> 1:14:21.461
I don't know. I don't know.

1:15:52.970 --> 1:15:55.055
God dang...

1:16:42.269 --> 1:16:45.606
I told you
that jalopy was a piece of shit.

1:16:47.107 --> 1:16:49.151
Should have bought American.

1:16:49.234 --> 1:16:52.946
I really didn't have
too many options. Now, did I?

1:16:59.620 --> 1:17:02.039
I made a promise to my mom.

1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:05.125
Now I broke it.

1:17:05.209 --> 1:17:07.669
Well, she probably won't remember though.

1:17:07.753 --> 1:17:09.213
You know?

1:17:10.589 --> 1:17:15.260
I swear,
I can't catch a break for nothing.

1:17:15.344 --> 1:17:19.139
Well, like I was saying,
I wish you could stay with my sister,

1:17:19.223 --> 1:17:22.976
but her old man's a genuine prick.

1:17:24.436 --> 1:17:27.564
Guy's always trying
to be king of the castle.

1:17:33.028 --> 1:17:35.822
Do you ever think about Ricky Powell?

1:17:38.575 --> 1:17:40.494
What made you think of him?

1:17:40.577 --> 1:17:44.915
I don't know. Popped in my head
a couple of days ago.

1:17:47.626 --> 1:17:50.546
Well, I mean, yeah, sometimes. I mean...

1:17:52.047 --> 1:17:55.175
You know, when they have
the anniversary or whatever.

1:17:56.468 --> 1:17:58.679
But, no, not really.

1:18:04.309 --> 1:18:06.311
You think we should have said something?

1:18:06.395 --> 1:18:08.146
No.

1:18:09.565 --> 1:18:12.401
I don't see how that could have done
a lick of good.

1:18:13.402 --> 1:18:17.990
I mean, them boys were hell-bent
on putting their hands on Ricky.

1:18:18.073 --> 1:18:20.868
And everybody at the school knew it.

1:18:26.081 --> 1:18:29.209
As far as I'm concerned,
if he didn't flap his gums so much,

1:18:29.293 --> 1:18:30.836
he'd still be alive.

1:18:50.439 --> 1:18:52.065
All right.

1:18:52.149 --> 1:18:55.027
Stan The Man back in the Mitten.

1:18:56.028 --> 1:18:57.821
You gonna make it okay?

1:18:57.905 --> 1:19:00.240
Well, I ain't got much choice, have I?

1:19:00.324 --> 1:19:02.492
See you on Friday for darts?

1:19:03.493 --> 1:19:06.079
Hey, Mountain Dew's on me.

1:19:29.228 --> 1:19:31.146
You gonna get that?

1:19:39.071 --> 1:19:40.405
Hey.

1:19:43.242 --> 1:19:47.412
I couldn't find his diaper bag.
It might be in your car somewhere.

1:19:48.455 --> 1:19:49.831
I heard about Oscar's.

1:19:50.832 --> 1:19:53.585
Yeah. Lousy gig anyway.

1:19:54.586 --> 1:19:56.213
How's the job search going?

1:19:56.296 --> 1:19:58.006
Oh, you know.

1:19:58.090 --> 1:20:01.343
Slow and steady wins the race, right?

1:20:02.427 --> 1:20:03.846
How's the world of self-care?

1:20:04.972 --> 1:20:06.348
Could be better.

1:20:07.349 --> 1:20:08.851
Could be worse.

1:20:09.852 --> 1:20:14.273
I finally made it to bronze team leader,
so I won't be working nights anymore.

1:20:14.356 --> 1:20:15.816
Oh, congrats.

1:20:15.899 --> 1:20:18.902
You planning on taking another trip
with your mom to celebrate?

1:20:20.237 --> 1:20:22.573
Actually, I'm going back to school.

1:20:23.574 --> 1:20:25.909
I start at Michigan State in the spring.

1:20:29.037 --> 1:20:31.039
That's... That's great.

1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:34.334
- So, what are you gonna study?
- Pre-law.

1:20:35.335 --> 1:20:37.754
Just gonna start chipping away, you know.

1:20:37.838 --> 1:20:42.050
Well, if you ever need a case study,
you know where to find me.

1:20:42.134 --> 1:20:44.178
On your mom's couch.

1:20:44.261 --> 1:20:45.888
Hey.

1:20:45.971 --> 1:20:49.516
Finally got a bed now.
Things are looking up.

1:20:54.438 --> 1:20:55.772
So, what about Carter, then?

1:20:57.608 --> 1:21:00.611
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1:21:01.612 --> 1:21:04.031
I'm gonna need you
to have my back on this, okay?

1:21:05.032 --> 1:21:06.366
Oh, yeah?

1:21:06.450 --> 1:21:10.370
I need you to take him some nights,
some weekends too.

1:21:10.454 --> 1:21:14.291
Look, Syd, I've been giving it
a lot of thought,

1:21:14.374 --> 1:21:16.418
and I think we should try again.

1:21:17.419 --> 1:21:21.298
- I'll do whatever it takes. Pride aside.
- Jevon...

1:21:21.381 --> 1:21:24.134
I think we're just
on two different paths right now.

1:21:25.135 --> 1:21:28.597
And I don't know if college
or a 9-to-5 will ever be your thing.

1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:31.517
You're just built
to do something different.

1:21:32.893 --> 1:21:35.687
There's indoor cats and outdoor cats,
and you're an outdoor cat.

1:21:49.368 --> 1:21:50.869
Syd...

1:21:56.333 --> 1:21:57.835
You'll be all right.

1:21:58.836 --> 1:22:00.671
You know that, right?

1:22:30.576 --> 1:22:34.788
I need more clean bins, Stanley.
And serving spoons too.

1:22:34.872 --> 1:22:37.332
- Pronto.
- Copy that. I'm on it.

1:22:45.757 --> 1:22:47.968
Thanks for coming in, sir.

1:23:18.415 --> 1:23:20.876
<i>"'I see a butterfly,' said Ben.</i>

1:23:20.959 --> 1:23:22.377
<i>'Here's an insect too.'</i>

1:23:22.461 --> 1:23:25.297
<i>'Pretty,' said Astro. 'Butterfly.'"</i>

1:23:25.380 --> 1:23:27.299
Look at the butterfly.

1:23:29.218 --> 1:23:30.677
Look.

1:23:30.761 --> 1:23:33.138
"'Will we see a spider?' asked Astro.

1:23:33.222 --> 1:23:34.681
'I'm afraid of spiders.'

1:23:35.682 --> 1:23:39.394
'Don't worry, Astro,' said Ava.
'We will watch for them.'"

1:24:06.255 --> 1:24:08.799
"'Pretty,' said Astro."
