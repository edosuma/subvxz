You might as well just lower
that trophy right now, boys.

Let's just lower the trophy.
Fine.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.502
Before we go any further,
I have a plan.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.704
Last time,
I went home empty-handed,

not tonight.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.640
Penn, do you have $20?

12:21.674 --> 12:23.642
- I do happen to, yes.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.444
- Whip it out, Penn.

20:36.768 --> 20:37.936
- Yeah.
- But look at it.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.871
Does it look like
a standard regulation card

20:39.905 --> 20:42.374
with something growing, living,
breathing inside the card?

20:42.407 --> 20:43.642
Would you do me a favor?

20:43.675 --> 20:45.143
Would you tear the corner
of the card?

20:45.177 --> 20:46.478
Just tear the corner
of the card.

20:46.511 --> 20:47.813
Just tear the corner,
just the corner.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.147
- Okay, I hear
what you're saying.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.716
- That's it, yep,
Keep going all the way down.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.584
All the way down, keep tearing,
all the way down.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.119
- Okay, all the way.
- All the way down.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.655
- Inside Alyson's card,

20:56.688 --> 20:58.824
I believe we should find

20:58.857 --> 21:01.893
a $20 bill signed

21:01.927 --> 21:03.996
by Penn

21:04.029 --> 21:06.164
from the beginning of the show.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.201
- Wow!

21:09.234 --> 21:12.537

21:12.571 --> 21:16.642
Piff the Magic Dragon!

21:16.675 --> 21:18.243
Oh!

21:18.277 --> 21:20.212
That was fabulous.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.047
- Thanks, Alyson.
Thanks for your help.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.383
- Yeah, I'm so glad
I got to be a part of it.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.052
- You nailed it with the math,
didn't you?

21:27.085 --> 21:28.954
- That was the hardest part.

21:28.987 --> 21:32.691
So are you disappointed
your disguise didn't fool them?

21:32.724 --> 21:34.626
- It did fool them, clearly.
It's just--

21:34.660 --> 21:35.994
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.362
- It would have been
the quickest fool in history.

21:37.396 --> 21:38.997
- Definitely, I mean,
for my count--and you know,

21:39.031 --> 21:40.899
the counting was the rough part
for me,

21:40.932 --> 21:43.735
but I feel like you got, like,
five or six trophies tonight.

21:43.769 --> 21:45.170
- I think so.

21:45.203 --> 21:48.206
And I could just have them
pre-packaged in one sort of,

21:48.240 --> 21:50.509
like, champagne crate,
that would be great.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.077
- Okay.

21:52.110 --> 21:54.279
What do you think
they're talking about?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.181
- Maybe how not to
break my heart.

21:56.214 --> 21:57.382
- That would be nice.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.318
Okay, Piff,
let's go to Penn and Teller

21:59.351 --> 22:04.189

you so desperately deserve.

22:04.222 --> 22:05.424
- Piff!

22:05.457 --> 22:06.825
- Yes.
- How are you?

22:06.858 --> 22:08.293
- I'm very good.
How are you, Penn?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.462
- Good to see you.
It's been ten years, Piff.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.998
We first met you over
in England.

22:13.031 --> 22:16.835
And since then, since your
first appearance on "Fool Us,"

22:16.868 --> 22:18.804
you've gone on
"America's Got Talent"

22:18.837 --> 22:21.373

although you didn't win.

I use the word "drag"

22:42.527 --> 22:45.664
very carefully--the big drag
in your life

22:45.697 --> 22:49.401
is you have not won
a "Fool Us" trophy.

22:49.434 --> 22:52.504
The first time on "Fool Us,"
you killed us.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.340
We loved you.
You did not win a trophy.

So Dad has created

25:52.017 --> 25:55.086
The only way out is magic.

All that's left to do is
attach the heavy metal door,

25:58.356 --> 26:01.693
and the solid metal latch,
and solid metal pin

26:01.726 --> 26:03.261
that's gonna seal me in tight.

26:03.295 --> 26:06.498
And I've got four volunteers
helping me out today.

26:12.671 --> 26:15.707
What makes this escape
especially difficult is

26:15.740 --> 26:17.042
that I'm barely
able to move.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.778
I'm completely trapped

30:34.966 --> 30:36.201
- Four times, Helen!

- We have a four-time Fooler!
- Four times.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.872
- Fool me once,
well, never mind.

30:40.905 --> 30:43.708
Fool me four times,
it's shame on everybody.

30:43.741 --> 30:46.878
But next time,
you're not gonna fool us.

30:46.911 --> 30:48.346
We're gonna prepare even more.
- That's a challenge.

30:48.379 --> 30:50.081
That's a challenge.
- That is a challenge.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.650

four-time Fooler!

Congratulations, Helen Coghlan.

Penn and Teller will keep
your trophy tucked away

31:29.254 --> 31:32.323
This next magician
already has a "Fool Us" trophy,

31:32.357 --> 31:35.860
but he wants to mess with
Penn and Teller one more time.

31:35.894 --> 31:36.995

I'm back again.

- For those that
are keeping score,

31:44.302 --> 31:46.671
I've been on "Fool Us"
four times.

31:46.704 --> 31:49.007
I'm pretty sure
that's a "Fool Us" record.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.110
And I've fooled
Penn and Teller twice.

31:52.143 --> 31:54.612
My wife Catherine
gets really nervous

31:54.646 --> 31:56.281
when she watches me perform.

31:56.314 --> 31:59.417
After my last appearance,
I promised her I'm done.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.619
I won't be back
on "Fool Us" again.

32:01.653 --> 32:05.890
But then, I thought of a new
trick, and it's a good one.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.826
My show in Boston
is my testing ground.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.428
Every trick I do here,

32:10.461 --> 32:12.630

hundreds of times.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.666
But I haven't been
doing shows lately,

32:14.699 --> 32:16.901
so I'll be facing
Penn and Teller

32:16.935 --> 32:18.703
with a trick I think
will work,

32:18.736 --> 32:20.438
but it's a little scary.

Catherine, I'm sorry,
but this is the last time.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.410

how I make out

32:25.443 --> 32:27.312
in this best of five series.

fifth appearance on "Fool Us,"

32:38.756 --> 32:41.926
please welcome Paul Gertner!

32:41.960 --> 32:44.295
- Thank you, thank you.

32:44.329 --> 32:46.164
Well, Penn, Teller,
it is a pleasure

32:46.197 --> 32:48.232
to be back here
on "Fool Us" again.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.767
And I realized,

32:49.801 --> 32:53.738
since I'm going for my third
"Fool Us" trophy,

32:53.771 --> 32:58.009
tonight I have
to perform a hat trick.

32:58.042 --> 32:59.277
- Yeah.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.379
- And it's a very simple trick.

33:01.412 --> 33:03.548
It uses three objects.

33:03.581 --> 33:07.018
It uses three dice, a hat,

33:07.051 --> 33:09.887
and it uses a magic wand.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.956
Now, the dice will stay here

33:11.990 --> 33:13.958
on the table by Penn.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.995
The hat will stay over here
on the table by Teller.

33:17.028 --> 33:19.964
And the wand is going
to stay in my hand.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.733
And if you
watch the three dice,

33:21.766 --> 33:23.234
I'll take them one at a time.

33:23.267 --> 33:26.170
Die number one,
I take it in the hand,

33:26.204 --> 33:27.705
I give it a tap,

33:27.739 --> 33:31.576
and it disappears,
and travels through the air,

33:31.609 --> 33:34.012
across the table,
over by Teller,

33:34.045 --> 33:36.280
under the hat.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.549
Now, that's the first time.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.051
I'll do it again.

33:40.084 --> 33:43.021
See, if you watch die
number two, and, Penn,

33:43.054 --> 33:45.523
if you watch very carefully,
I'm gonna place it in my hand.

33:45.556 --> 33:47.658
I'll ask you a question.
You can be honest.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.227
You're not gonna
hurt my feelings.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.029
Do you think it's still there?
Or you think it's gone already?

33:51.062 --> 33:53.031
- I think it's in the hand.
- You're right.

33:53.064 --> 33:55.767
I didn't do anything yet,
but this is die number two,

33:55.800 --> 33:58.970
which means I have
to tap it twice.

33:59.003 --> 34:00.972
And then it disappears,

34:01.005 --> 34:03.574
travels through the air,
across the table,

34:03.608 --> 34:06.577
over by Teller, under the hat.

34:06.611 --> 34:09.747
Now, I'll do it one more time,
but this time, Teller,

34:09.781 --> 34:12.583
I'm going to reveal part
of the secret to the trick,

34:12.617 --> 34:14.952
not the whole secret,
just part of the secret.

34:14.986 --> 34:17.155
You see, when I pick up the die

34:17.188 --> 34:18.756
and I place it in my hand,

34:18.790 --> 34:21.359
it only stays here
for a few seconds.

34:21.392 --> 34:24.228
And when I tap it,
I don't just tap it,

34:24.262 --> 34:26.931
I give it what we call
in the trade a tap and take.

34:26.964 --> 34:28.900
You're familiar with that,
of course.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.768
It's something magicians use
all the time.

34:30.802 --> 34:34.138
You see, I tap and take it
at the same time.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.673
Now, let me explain.

34:35.706 --> 34:38.409
When I did this the first
few times, you didn't see it,

34:38.443 --> 34:40.445
because my hands were
moving so fast,

34:40.478 --> 34:42.680
even if you watched this
in slow-motion video,

34:42.713 --> 34:45.550
you wouldn't see the tap
and take done at fast speed.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.685
But watch what happens
when I slow down the process.

34:47.718 --> 34:50.955
You can see the tap
and the take separated

34:50.988 --> 34:52.523
by about half a second.

34:52.557 --> 34:55.126
I take it from here
over to here.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.361
I pretend to place it
in my pocket.

34:57.395 --> 35:00.465
But of course, in reality,
I'm going to take this die,

35:00.498 --> 35:02.733
and I'm going to flick it
under the hat,

35:02.767 --> 35:05.570
and it looks like
it was there all the while.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.805
Now, we'll do it one
last time, though.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.174
You see, if I take two
in the hand,

35:10.208 --> 35:13.077
one in the pocket--Penn,
how many in the hand?

35:13.111 --> 35:15.213
- Two.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.582
- But if I give it a tap,
there's one, two, three.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.784
I'll do it again,
here, Teller, so you can see.

35:19.817 --> 35:22.954
Two in the hand,
one stays in the pocket.

35:22.987 --> 35:24.355
Yeah.

35:24.388 --> 35:26.157
But if I give it a tap,

35:26.190 --> 35:28.693
now there's one,
two, and three.

35:28.726 --> 35:31.362
Penn, Teller,
this is your last chance

35:31.395 --> 35:34.365
to see how they get
in the pocket or the hand.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.901
Slow-motion.
That's one.

35:36.934 --> 35:38.102
That's two.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.004
This one stays in the pocket.

35:40.037 --> 35:43.708
And Penn, if you watch
very closely, take a guess.

the dice are?

have combined under the hat

- Is this a trick
they'd be familiar with?

37:03.020 --> 37:05.022
- Well, actually,
I've been doing the bulk

37:05.056 --> 37:06.824
of the trick
for about 40 years.

But that ending,

what are they gonna
be looking for?

37:15.633 --> 37:16.601
- Completely.
- Oh.

37:16.634 --> 37:17.868
- Completely, yeah.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.904
There's a number of elements

37:19.937 --> 37:22.006
designed in this trick
just for that purpose.

37:22.039 --> 37:24.609
- So do they have a blind spot?

37:24.642 --> 37:26.944
- Hmm, that's a good question.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.879
'Cause I don't know,
but I'm hoping I found it.

Paul, well,

37:30.648 --> 37:32.984

gives you a hat trick.

37:33.017 --> 37:34.885
- Okay.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.787
- Hey, Paul, we love having you
on the show,

37:36.821 --> 37:38.022
for all sorts of reasons.

First of all, we love you,
and you're great.

37:39.824 --> 37:42.860
But also, even if you do
classic stuff,

37:42.893 --> 37:45.363
you do it better
than anyone else.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.665
And for anybody
who's studying magic,

37:47.698 --> 37:50.268
you got a ball routine here,

37:50.301 --> 37:52.436
you've got two in the hand,
one in the pocket,

37:52.470 --> 37:56.807
you've got a Max Malini
big ending with big things.

37:56.841 --> 38:01.812
And a lot of people are very,
very happy to do one big finish

38:01.846 --> 38:03.414
or two big finishes,

38:03.447 --> 38:07.618
or rarely three,
but you did, like--all nested,

38:07.652 --> 38:09.654
one in the other, like four.

38:09.687 --> 38:12.089
And then if you add
all the dice together, you did,

38:12.123 --> 38:13.824
like, dozens,

38:13.858 --> 38:15.426
maybe a hundred
big endings there.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.794
It's really great.

38:16.827 --> 38:19.764
And when you fool us,
I always get a little angry,

38:19.797 --> 38:22.633
and I've called you
a lot of things, Paul,

38:22.667 --> 38:26.304
not all to your face,
some to Teller here.

38:26.337 --> 38:29.573
But the one we haven't
called you is a cockroach.

38:29.607 --> 38:31.609
I've never called you
a cockroach.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.844
But I wanted
to call you a cockroach.

38:33.878 --> 38:38.149
It reminded us of when we were
on David Letterman's program.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.284
And on David Letterman's
program,

38:40.318 --> 38:43.554
we had a top hat that we
brought away from the desk

38:43.587 --> 38:46.424
and then put back on the desk,
and then opened it up,

38:46.457 --> 38:48.392
and it had--or pulled it
off--and it had,

38:48.426 --> 38:52.396
like, hundreds,
hundreds of cockroaches.

38:52.430 --> 38:53.397
- Ew.

38:53.431 --> 38:54.565
- And I think the way

38:54.598 --> 38:57.068
we loaded
those final cockroaches

38:57.101 --> 39:00.204
was very similar to the way
you did the dice there.

39:00.237 --> 39:03.274
And when I did all the
cockroaches on David Letterman,

39:03.307 --> 39:04.942
and they covered
David Letterman,

39:04.975 --> 39:08.979
I called my mother
and told her what we had done

39:09.013 --> 39:11.215
to David Letterman,
and she said to me,

39:11.248 --> 39:14.618
"You will never work
in show business again.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.721
You'll never be
on that show again."

39:16.754 --> 39:20.725
And I want to say to you, Paul,
I don't think you fooled us,

39:20.758 --> 39:23.661
but I really, really hope
you're on this show

39:23.694 --> 39:26.163
a lot more in the future.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.099
- Well...
- Well?

39:28.132 --> 39:32.203
- I think you definitely nailed
that cockroach thing.

39:32.236 --> 39:34.638
- Aww, so they know
how you did the trick?

39:34.672 --> 39:35.906
- I think they got me.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.341
- Aww.

Well, Paul,
we love you so much.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.376
a signature trick
from our amazing duo.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.111
Take it away, Penn and Teller.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.946
- Stay right here, Alyson.
I want to show you something.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.582
You know, there's still
some people that have trouble

40:18.616 --> 40:20.918
accepting evolution as fact.

40:20.951 --> 40:22.953
I think their problem is
they can't imagine--no matter

40:22.987 --> 40:25.289
what the time period
is--one species

40:25.322 --> 40:26.624
turning into another.

40:26.657 --> 40:29.860
But I am uniquely gifted
to give them a demonstration

40:29.894 --> 40:31.562
how that can happen
'cause I can turn

40:31.595 --> 40:32.797

Step over there on the other
side of my gorillas gas.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.568
Teller created
this gorilla gas,

40:37.601 --> 40:39.837
which helps my DNA reformulate.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.038
I just have
to take a hit of it,

40:41.071 --> 40:43.908

See, Alyson,
already I feel different.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.611
And--ahh!
I'm turning into a gorilla.

40:47.645 --> 40:49.513
The species is
actually changing.

40:49.547 --> 40:50.848
But I don't want
to hurt you, Alyson.

40:50.881 --> 40:52.616
And I will
as I become more animal.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.419
So lock me in this cage.
Lock me in this cage, Alyson.

I don't want to hurt you,
but I will.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.189
Lock it,
and then go in the chair.

40:58.222 --> 40:59.557
- Okay.
- Alyson, go in the chair.
