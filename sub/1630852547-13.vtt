00:02.561 --> 00:04.895
-This girl can sing, right?
-She's amazing.

00:04.988 --> 00:08.065
CJ loves Pippa G.
He says she's gonna be big.

00:08.234 --> 00:09.657
I am so proud of you.

00:09.752 --> 00:13.161
Max Kingbird writing a song
for an Insta-Toky singer

00:13.180 --> 00:14.571
who I'm obsessed with.

00:14.664 --> 00:17.182
Ever since I told you
who she was five minutes ago.

00:17.259 --> 00:18.742
You never let me seem cool.

00:18.911 --> 00:20.185
Sorry, I'll look into that.

00:20.412 --> 00:22.187
What'd I tell you?
If you keep

00:22.414 --> 00:23.671
doing open mics here,
it'll pay off.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.357
A lot of talent's been
discovered on that stage.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.526
Actually, I met her mom
at the gym

00:27.753 --> 00:29.028
and I slipped a demo in her bag.

00:29.255 --> 00:31.922
I'm-a still take credit.
You tell Pippa I discovered you.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.198
You're the Justin Bieber
to my Usher.

00:33.425 --> 00:34.533
(laughing)

00:34.760 --> 00:37.444
Okay, this is not a done deal.
We're just meeting

00:37.596 --> 00:38.779
to see if we connect.

00:38.931 --> 00:40.706
And it's not going to help
if you all are hovering.

00:40.783 --> 00:41.948
But we're your posse.

00:42.101 --> 00:43.709
Like Taylor Swift
has her "Swifties,"

00:43.860 --> 00:45.544
and we're your "Kingbirdies."

00:45.621 --> 00:47.212
Would it help
if when she gets here

00:47.364 --> 00:48.380
we fangirl out over you?

00:48.457 --> 00:50.698
Like, I do
a very convincing swoon.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.775
RANDI:
Uh, excuse me,

00:51.868 --> 00:53.777
I don't fangirl out over anyone,

00:53.946 --> 00:56.613
but I guess I can try
to make you seem interesting.

00:56.706 --> 00:57.872
More interesting.

00:57.966 --> 00:59.541
Say he slept
with someone famous.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.708
But keep it believable.

01:00.803 --> 01:02.710
Remember, he's a nine,
not a ten.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.896
Hey, I'm a Midwestern 12.

01:04.065 --> 01:07.215
Okay? And I would prefer it
if the "Kingbirdies"

01:07.234 --> 01:08.792
were not here
when Pippa arriv...

01:08.811 --> 01:10.051
-Oh, it's too late.
-KAT: Oh.

01:10.129 --> 01:11.904
Hey, everyone!
Which one of you is Max?

01:11.980 --> 01:13.555
That's me.
Ah, it's nice to meet y...

01:13.649 --> 01:16.533
-Here, put this
by your face and smile.
-Oh.

01:17.561 --> 01:18.393
(camera clicks)

01:18.487 --> 01:19.469
Oh, don't worry about your face,

01:19.488 --> 01:20.412
I can fix it.

01:20.564 --> 01:22.081
Oh. Well, I wasn't
worried before,

01:22.308 --> 01:23.731
but now, I kind of am.

01:23.826 --> 01:25.567
Um, hi, Pippa. I'm Kat.

01:25.661 --> 01:28.253
So, is this a new thing,
taking pictures with beverages?

01:28.480 --> 01:29.830
Like, is it the new planking?

01:29.924 --> 01:31.573
Is it called "dranking"?
(chuckles)

01:31.667 --> 01:34.668
I like you.
You've got funny mom energy.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.761
Thanks.

01:35.912 --> 01:38.171
Energy drink.
Never heard of "Ack."

01:38.324 --> 01:39.673
Oh, no, no, no.
It's "Ack!"

01:39.825 --> 01:41.266
-(all exclaim)
-(laughs)

01:41.418 --> 01:43.009
You need energy
just to pronounce it.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.011
-Uh-huh.
-Well, I'm really excited

01:45.164 --> 01:46.012
to be working with you.

01:46.165 --> 01:47.180
Yeah, Max is amazing.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.273
We collaborated back in college.

01:48.425 --> 01:50.500
We were doing mash-ups
before Glee.

01:50.519 --> 01:51.693
I know.

01:52.929 --> 01:53.837
Cool.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.840
-(can pops)
-Oh, uh, wouldn't drink that.

01:56.859 --> 01:58.992
Hasn't been tested
on humans yet.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.775
We got some bad news.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.461
Renaldo quit the bowling team.

02:09.688 --> 02:13.114
He broke up with his husband
and he's moving to Mykonos.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.358
That's weird. I joined

02:14.376 --> 02:15.968
after Sebastian
broke up with his husband

02:16.195 --> 02:17.194
and moved to Mykonos.

02:17.287 --> 02:18.595
That's a crazy coincidence.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.973
Oh.

02:21.124 --> 02:24.701
Oh, here's an idea. How about
Kat joins the "Gutter Queens"?

02:24.720 --> 02:27.871
Oh, I-I don't think you guys
would want me.

02:27.890 --> 02:29.297
Katharine is terrible
at bowling.

02:29.391 --> 02:31.466
Damn, Sheila.
Way to just say it.

02:31.635 --> 02:32.893
No, she's right. Go on.

02:33.045 --> 02:34.394
Tell them what happened
the first time I tried.

02:34.546 --> 02:36.488
She got her head stuck
in the ball return.

02:36.715 --> 02:37.972
We had to call
the fire department.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.383
That was really exciting.

02:39.401 --> 02:41.643
And in all the confusion,
I got to keep the shoes.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.722
There's a warning label on all
ball returns now because of her.

02:45.724 --> 02:47.482
You must be so proud.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.559
Oh, honey, none
of the Gutter Queens

02:49.653 --> 02:50.669
are good bowlers.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.153
Except me,
I'm kind of the ringer.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.673
You can call me
"King of the Queens."

02:54.900 --> 02:56.675
He is right.
We were in last place

02:56.902 --> 03:01.162
until he took us all the way up
to almost last place.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.664
The point is,
we just play for fun,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.266
and who's more fun than my girl?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.167
So, are you in?

03:06.261 --> 03:07.594
As long as it's just for fun.

03:07.746 --> 03:09.837
And the good news is:
my head's too big now

03:09.857 --> 03:11.081
to fit in the ball return.

03:11.099 --> 03:14.151
Keep an eye on her,
she'll find a way.

03:15.754 --> 03:16.862
So, that song I sent you

03:17.089 --> 03:18.513
is really just something
to work off of.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.273
I'm completely open
to any ideas...

03:20.426 --> 03:23.535
Yeah, I didn't listen to it yet,
but my mom says you're great.

03:23.762 --> 03:25.262
Well, you have a lovely mom.

03:26.189 --> 03:27.597
-So, it goes
something like this.
-(plays piano)

03:27.691 --> 03:29.374
-Hey, can we take a selfie?
-Oh, okay.

03:29.601 --> 03:32.602
I need people over 28
so my fans know I'm not ageist.

03:33.363 --> 03:35.196

token 30-year-old.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.007

Let's create some content

that could actually help
your music career.

04:22.579 --> 04:23.595
Rude.

04:23.822 --> 04:25.597
I'm sorry, I just...

04:25.824 --> 04:27.841
I take this very seriously.

04:27.993 --> 04:29.493
And you have an amazing voice,

04:29.586 --> 04:33.939
but if I'm being honest,
you're better than your songs.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.332
If I'm being honest,

04:35.501 --> 04:36.942
I don't care
how good your songs are

because no one hears them.

04:40.430 --> 04:41.671
I think we should hit
pause on this.

04:41.765 --> 04:44.007
And-and it's not because
I can't take criticism,

04:44.100 --> 04:45.659

05:53.428 --> 05:56.913
I don't know how to act

05:56.932 --> 05:58.748
He makes me so nervous.

05:58.767 --> 06:00.417
Are you crushing on him?

06:00.435 --> 06:04.011
I mean, I don't even know
if Glen is gay.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.680
He gets flirty with me,

06:05.699 --> 06:08.441
but now he's over there
hugging on that woman.

06:08.594 --> 06:09.851
Maybe he's bisexual.

06:09.945 --> 06:13.455
Oh, right. I've heard
that's real now.

06:14.282 --> 06:15.782
Why don't you just ask him?

06:15.934 --> 06:16.933
I can't.

06:17.026 --> 06:19.119
Men of my generation
are not as open

06:19.271 --> 06:20.379
about things like that.

06:20.530 --> 06:22.455
That's why our gay bars
were always called

06:22.549 --> 06:26.109
"Secrets" or "Whispers" or
"Thursday Night Choir Practice."

06:26.870 --> 06:28.536
Phil, come on,
you've got another turn.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.370
Oh, hell.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.723
My fries are getting cold.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.061
All right, Kat, your turn.

06:36.212 --> 06:37.637
Marilyn Monroe that ball.

06:37.714 --> 06:40.123
Maybe you should just
take my turn for me.

06:40.142 --> 06:42.025
Come on, I got you.

06:42.794 --> 06:43.960
And so just like this.

06:43.979 --> 06:46.053
You got to remember
to follow through.

06:46.222 --> 06:48.389
Oh, I like this part.

06:48.467 --> 06:51.559
I do, too, but at some point
we got to let go of the ball.

06:51.637 --> 06:53.161
Okay.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.914
Uh... Oh!

06:56.065 --> 06:58.992
-Gutter ball.
-That's okay. Ah, little tip.

06:59.144 --> 07:00.143
You see those arrows?

07:00.162 --> 07:01.903
Aim for those,
don't look at the pins.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.647
Listen to him. He's our ringer.

07:03.815 --> 07:05.590
You said that already, Phil.

07:06.334 --> 07:09.836
Oh, right. That makes sense.

07:09.988 --> 07:11.746
It's kind of like
non-Euclidean geometry

07:11.765 --> 07:15.325
where lines that appear parallel
intersect at the front pin.

07:15.343 --> 07:16.601
Like a triangle.

07:16.753 --> 07:19.563
Yeah, if that means
"aim for the arrows," then yes.

07:23.685 --> 07:26.027
(electronic trilling)

07:29.675 --> 07:31.140
Oh, that looks promising!

07:32.268 --> 07:34.678

-See? What'd I tell you?

07:34.696 --> 07:36.529
That's seven for Kat!

07:36.682 --> 07:37.622

08:17.981 --> 08:18.905
You were amazing.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.724
I mean, I wasn't
at my best today

08:20.742 --> 08:22.501
'cause I was helping my girl,
but you were great.

08:22.652 --> 08:24.485
Will you look at that?

08:24.579 --> 08:27.564
We are up to 15th place.

08:27.582 --> 08:28.898
(laughing)

08:28.992 --> 08:32.219
I think we got ourselves
a new ringer!

08:33.755 --> 08:35.739
I wasn't at my best today
'cause I was helping my girl.

08:35.832 --> 08:39.267
You said that already, Oscar.
Don't be pathetic.

08:46.342 --> 08:48.601
Hi, Max here.
The Bartender Bae.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.696
Let's talk lemons.
So, the secret to getting

08:51.848 --> 08:53.532
a uniform slice
is you want to make sure...

08:53.759 --> 08:54.515
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

08:54.609 --> 08:55.534
What are you doing?

08:55.761 --> 08:58.537
Creating content?
Ugh, kill me now.

08:59.431 --> 09:00.780
My man's going down
a rabbit hole.

09:00.932 --> 09:03.116
Pretty soon, he's gonna be
posting himself by a pool,

09:03.268 --> 09:04.543
drinking Chardonnay,

09:04.770 --> 09:06.694
saying stuff like,
"I'm living my best life."

09:06.788 --> 09:08.713
Well, Pippa's right.
It's not about music anymore.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.197
It's about followers.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.551
And people will do
the craziest stuff to get them,

09:12.702 --> 09:14.778
like pranks
and-and danger challenges.

09:14.796 --> 09:16.780
Look, this guy lost a testicle.

09:16.798 --> 09:17.964
But he got
two million followers,

09:18.116 --> 09:19.391
and he just sold a movie.

09:19.542 --> 09:20.967
That's worth a nut.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.544
You can't ignore
how powerful that stuff is.

09:23.638 --> 09:25.546
Even the girl who ate
a bucket of cinnamon

09:25.640 --> 09:28.308
just bought a seat
on Jeff Bezos' rocket.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.810
She did? I could eat cinnamon.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.070
MAX:
See?

09:32.263 --> 09:34.314
You got to be in the game.

09:34.466 --> 09:37.150
Hi, Max here. Let's cut lemons.

09:37.302 --> 09:39.077
Uh-uh. Give me that.
You are not posting that.

09:39.228 --> 09:40.470
I know. It's boring.

09:40.563 --> 09:42.155
But what am I supposed to do?
Jump off a cliff?

09:42.231 --> 09:43.397
Lick an airplane toilet seat?

09:43.566 --> 09:45.308
I don't even have money
for a ticket.

09:45.401 --> 09:47.460
That's what's stopping you?

09:48.830 --> 09:50.237
No one is licking anything.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.091
We're gonna keep it classy
and make it about the music.

09:53.242 --> 09:55.168
Oh, I like that. Wait, "we"?

09:55.320 --> 09:56.595
Yeah, people know
I live with you.

09:56.746 --> 09:59.264
I can't have you running
around here looking like a fool.

09:59.415 --> 10:01.600
(coughing)

10:04.087 --> 10:06.688
That cinnamon girl
earned her money.

10:09.184 --> 10:10.591
"The Bowling Winners"?

10:10.685 --> 10:13.278
I guess it sort of has a ring.

10:13.429 --> 10:16.339
I was just getting used to
being called a "Gutter Queen."

10:16.358 --> 10:17.949
Well, I thought we needed
a team name

10:18.101 --> 10:19.509
that had a little more optimism,

10:19.527 --> 10:21.119
but now that I'm hearing you
say it, I'm not loving it.

10:21.196 --> 10:22.269
We'll revisit after practice.

10:22.364 --> 10:24.605
Why are we practicing here?

10:24.625 --> 10:26.041
Or at all?

10:26.868 --> 10:29.628
To become "bowling winners."

10:29.813 --> 10:31.371
Why do I like it when I say it?

10:31.465 --> 10:34.448
Turns out bowling
is all about math.

10:34.542 --> 10:37.026
So, we're gonna improve
our game with...

10:37.120 --> 10:38.452
numbers.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.363
Sounds an awful lot
like homework.

10:40.532 --> 10:41.839
I know, right?

10:43.218 --> 10:45.477
Now, a ball thrown down a lane
will slow down over its course,

10:45.628 --> 10:47.312
and the main cause of that
is friction.

10:47.463 --> 10:49.964
So, let's talk
friction and mass.

10:50.058 --> 10:53.526
Ooh, I'm getting flashbacks
from my first time.

10:54.562 --> 10:55.302
See?

10:55.397 --> 10:57.138
We're having fun already.

10:57.232 --> 10:59.658
Now, let's call the mass "M"
and the ball's radius "R."

10:59.809 --> 11:00.975
Easy-peasy, right?

11:01.069 --> 11:03.736
The rotational inertia "I"
equals two-fifths...

11:03.830 --> 11:06.239
Uh, Carter, for the tenth time,

11:06.391 --> 11:08.057
it goes, bam, bam, bam,

11:08.059 --> 11:09.650
-spin around, bam.
-Right, right.

11:09.744 --> 11:11.318
I keep adding an extra bam.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.413
Yeah, and I'm not getting
any attitude here.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.048
I need to see attitude.

11:15.750 --> 11:16.841
Okay.

11:16.993 --> 11:19.827
-Now I'm getting attitude.
-Yeah, you are.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.222
Uh, baby, just save it
for the camera, okay?

Hey, we look damn good.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.603
All right, I'm gonna say it.

11:53.696 --> 11:55.438
-We are TikTok stars.
-(Randi exclaims)

11:55.457 --> 11:57.440
Someone had to.
So, what do we do next?

11:57.459 --> 11:58.624
People are going
to expect something.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.219
Oh, you're right,
but how do we top ourselves?

12:01.370 --> 12:02.962
Now I know how Beyoncé feels.

12:03.131 --> 12:04.723
I always know how Beyoncé feels.

12:04.874 --> 12:07.450
(laughing) Ooh,
maybe Max could do that thing

12:07.452 --> 12:08.709
where he dances
with a clone of himself.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.286
Or we can get him
a green screen.

12:10.305 --> 12:12.805
He can dance in cool places,
like, bam, he's on the moon,

12:12.974 --> 12:14.974
or bam, he's underwater,
or bam...

12:15.068 --> 12:16.793
Oh, now you get the bams?

12:17.553 --> 12:20.405
And, when exactly am I supposed
to be doing all this stuff?

12:20.556 --> 12:22.073
Well, what do you do
on your days off?

12:22.150 --> 12:23.074
I write music.

12:23.226 --> 12:24.300
We're dancers now, Max.

12:24.393 --> 12:25.818
You got to pick your priorities.

12:25.971 --> 12:27.895
Music<i> is</i> my priority.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.806
That's the whole reason
we're doing this.

12:29.824 --> 12:32.417
No, that's why you're doing it.
I'm doing it to get verified.

12:32.527 --> 12:34.568
All I want is to get paid
to write a song.

12:34.662 --> 12:36.662
I don't want to dance
with my clone on the moon.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.815
Yeah, we moved past that, Bae.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.242
This was fun,
and we look amazing

12:41.410 --> 12:43.002
and I definitely
belong in front.

12:43.746 --> 12:45.171
But I'm a 40-year-old man

12:45.323 --> 12:47.248
who just pulled his groin
trying to get 300 followers.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.749
(sighs)
I don't know, guys.

12:48.843 --> 12:50.435
If this is what it takes
to go big,

12:50.586 --> 12:53.438
maybe it's just
not gonna happen.

12:53.589 --> 12:55.589
(groaning)

12:55.609 --> 13:00.028
-300 followers seems generous.
-I was gonna say.

13:04.526 --> 13:05.283
(pins clattering)

13:05.434 --> 13:07.452
Oh, yes!
That is my boyfriend

13:07.603 --> 13:10.638
giving us a "stone eight."
We can work with that!

13:10.698 --> 13:12.957
Uh, that would've been a spare
if you would use the arrows.

13:13.184 --> 13:14.684
I-I know about the arrows.

13:14.777 --> 13:15.943
I'm the one who told you
about the arrows, remember?

13:15.962 --> 13:17.495
Right, right, right.
That was the moment

13:17.647 --> 13:19.780
the "Gutter Queens" became
"The Bowling Winners."

13:19.800 --> 13:20.690
(chuckles)

13:20.783 --> 13:21.874
Oh, uh, Wyatt,

13:22.027 --> 13:23.209
make sure to keep
your wrist straight.

13:23.361 --> 13:24.969
Last time it was
too loose and floppy.

13:25.196 --> 13:26.696
Was I just gay bashed?

13:26.714 --> 13:29.641
Oh, toughen up, Tinker Bell.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.959
All right, Wyatt,
you are gonna slay this.

13:32.053 --> 13:36.130
Now, remember to follow through
and visualize that triangle.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.709
When I asked God
for any kind of human touch,

13:39.727 --> 13:42.070
I wasn't picturing this.

13:44.716 --> 13:46.049
Hey, superstar.

13:46.234 --> 13:48.309
Thought you might like a beer.
They gave me two by mistake.

13:48.403 --> 13:49.661
Oh, how sweet.

13:49.812 --> 13:51.830
Hey, Glen,
what movie is this from?

13:51.981 --> 13:54.590
"They drummed you
right out of Hollywood,

13:54.592 --> 13:57.335
so you come crawling back
to Broadway."

13:57.562 --> 13:58.728
Hey, Glen, Glen,

13:58.730 --> 14:00.580
I think we just pulled
ahead of you. Ring!

14:00.732 --> 14:04.250
Hang on. Hello?
Uh-huh. Yes, I'll tell him.

14:04.402 --> 14:05.492
That was your mom. She said,

14:05.570 --> 14:07.570
"You left your game
at home, son."

14:07.663 --> 14:10.348
My mother passed away
last Christmas.

14:10.425 --> 14:13.167
May her memory be only
for a blessing.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.261
See you later, dude.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.938
We still pulled ahead of you.

14:18.249 --> 14:22.101
Kat, I was trying to figure out
if Glen is gay.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.029
So, I was quoting a line
from<i> Valley of the Dolls</i>

14:25.181 --> 14:26.589
to see if he'd pick up on it.

14:26.608 --> 14:27.940
OSCAR:
Kat, your turn.

14:28.093 --> 14:29.659
I-I promise
I'll make it up to you.

14:30.762 --> 14:32.370
So, according to
my calculations,

14:32.521 --> 14:34.539
if we take this game,
we move into tenth place.

14:34.766 --> 14:36.432
Wow, that's great.

14:36.601 --> 14:37.600
Hey, just remember,

14:37.619 --> 14:39.377
everyone's here
to have a good time.

14:39.562 --> 14:40.527
I thought we were.

14:40.622 --> 14:41.880
Yeah, I just, I'm worried
the guys think

14:42.031 --> 14:43.381
you're being a little
intense, you know,

14:43.532 --> 14:44.865
with all the technique advice
and corrections.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.551
I just want everyone
to get better.

14:46.702 --> 14:48.961
Before you got here,
no one wanted to get better.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.723
Also, your "no fries
in the team area" rule

14:51.950 --> 14:53.116
did not go over well.

14:53.134 --> 14:55.376
Uh, greasy fingers
are the enemy of bowling.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.470
Just don't be the enemy of fun.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.922
I don't want the guys
to kick you off the team, right?

14:59.924 --> 15:01.624
They can't kick me off the team.

15:01.717 --> 15:03.568
I am the team!

15:06.297 --> 15:08.197

15:40.498 --> 15:41.347
Aw, thanks.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.424
So, what are you doing here?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.350
Um...

15:44.444 --> 15:47.003
My mom gave my manager
your demo.

15:47.021 --> 15:48.613
She really liked it.

15:49.507 --> 15:50.506
Oh, did she?

15:50.675 --> 15:52.599
Yeah, she thought, uh...

15:52.694 --> 15:55.102
She thought that your songs
might be better than mine.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.013
Oh, did she?

15:57.148 --> 15:58.531
I just said that.

15:59.534 --> 16:03.127
Anyway, she wants you to write
a few songs for me.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.113
We want you to write some songs.

16:06.282 --> 16:08.449
Wait, really?
That would be great.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.285
Yay! Oh, my manager wanted me
to give you this.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.637
I guess it's called a check?

16:12.864 --> 16:14.973
It's like crypto
but for old people.

16:16.201 --> 16:18.309
Well, somebody's having
steak tonight.

16:18.461 --> 16:20.794
With a moderately priced wine.

16:21.630 --> 16:23.206
So, you want to work
on the arrangement?

16:23.299 --> 16:24.557
-Let's do it.
-Come on.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.726
Hey, I saw your video.
You got some moves.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.377
Thanks. I can teach it to you.

16:28.471 --> 16:29.988

Ladies, it's okay.

Have I been making you crazy?

17:03.097 --> 17:04.413

17:04.507 --> 17:07.416
I mean, you did muck up

And I don't love
having to gobble

17:09.345 --> 17:11.029
every time you bowl a turkey.

17:11.256 --> 17:13.531
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

17:14.425 --> 17:16.425
I feel horrible.
Should I quit?

17:16.444 --> 17:17.851
Do you want me to resign
as captain?

17:17.871 --> 17:20.020
I don't remember there
being an election.

17:20.114 --> 17:22.281
Well, there was a vacuum,
I stepped in.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.949
Quit the team?
Are you kidding?

17:24.102 --> 17:25.618
We're about to break
the top ten.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.694
We're getting dirty looks
from the other teams.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.531
-That's never happened before.
-(chuckles)

17:30.550 --> 17:31.791
So, we're cool?

17:31.943 --> 17:33.292
Be as hard on us as you want.

17:33.444 --> 17:37.613
Hell yeah, get out there, girl,
and get us that trophy.

17:37.706 --> 17:38.948
Okay. Well, Wyatt,

17:39.041 --> 17:41.017
I think you know
what to do with those fries.

17:41.969 --> 17:43.478
Yes, sir.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.547
Let's go, Bowling Winners!

17:47.550 --> 17:49.901
Eighth place is pretty good,
right? (chuckles)

17:49.977 --> 17:50.976
Yep.

17:51.053 --> 17:52.628
I mean, we got
this little plaque

17:52.647 --> 17:54.480
and this coupon
for bottomless nachos.

17:54.632 --> 17:56.390
Do not give me a challenge
like that.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.159
I will win.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.411
Mm-hmm.

18:00.563 --> 18:02.080
Are you okay?

18:02.916 --> 18:05.232
Yeah, of course, totes magotes.

18:05.251 --> 18:09.087
I've never heard you say
"totes magotes" before.

18:09.314 --> 18:11.089
Is something bothering you?

18:13.334 --> 18:15.259
Come on, Oscar, talk to me.

18:16.579 --> 18:17.744
Look... (sighs)

18:17.764 --> 18:20.264
Kat, I'm a pretty good bowler.

18:20.416 --> 18:22.249
Yes, you are.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.009
But I'm a little bit better.

18:24.162 --> 18:25.728
(laughing)

18:27.498 --> 18:28.589
Oh.

18:28.757 --> 18:30.441
Wait, is that a problem for you?

18:30.668 --> 18:31.851
Of course not.

18:32.003 --> 18:33.945
Are you sure?

18:34.096 --> 18:35.004
(exhales)

18:35.097 --> 18:36.823
This is going to sound
so stupid.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.844
I kind of liked being the ringer
even on a not-so-great team.

18:41.863 --> 18:45.014
But you're still a great bowler.

18:45.183 --> 18:47.608
How do I put this? Uh...

18:47.627 --> 18:51.629
Kat, you are the type of person
who shines wherever you are.

18:52.874 --> 18:56.300
I guess I liked having a place
where I shined a little, too.

18:57.195 --> 18:58.803
Oh, Oscar, that's crazy.

18:59.030 --> 19:00.696
I mean, you shine all the time.

19:00.715 --> 19:01.714
-You are amazing.
-No.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.307
You don't have to do this.

19:03.459 --> 19:05.792
Really. This is my issue,
not yours.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.553
But I-I think we should
talk about it.

19:07.722 --> 19:10.206
No, it's okay. We're good.

19:10.224 --> 19:12.466
-Really.
-Really?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.301
Really.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.653
I promise.

19:34.156 --> 19:36.507
I'm learning
not to read the comments,

19:36.734 --> 19:37.900
it gets in your head.

19:37.993 --> 19:39.418
I was called "really talented,"

19:39.570 --> 19:42.013
"a poor man's
Harry Connick Jr.,"

19:42.240 --> 19:44.182
and someone thought
they knew me from porn.

19:45.076 --> 19:46.267
They didn't.

19:47.169 --> 19:48.928
You know, I've got stuff to say.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.264
Maybe I should do more
of that social media.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.582
(chuckles)

19:53.601 --> 19:55.935
Here's to the beginning
of a big-ass career.

19:56.087 --> 19:57.361
And remember,
if you crash and burn,

19:57.513 --> 19:59.438
or you do something stupid
to get canceled,

19:59.532 --> 20:02.349
there will always be a plunger
and a clogged toilet

20:02.368 --> 20:03.592
with your name on it.

20:04.445 --> 20:06.445
Wait, wait, wait.
I want to say something.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.614
When you win your first Grammy,

20:08.766 --> 20:12.251
I will be right there
in the front row, swooning.

20:13.195 --> 20:15.362
Yes, there will be swooning.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.288
To Max.

20:16.365 --> 20:18.865
-Oh, to Max!
-To Max.

20:19.034 --> 20:21.126
Oh, Phil. Look over there.

20:21.203 --> 20:23.112
What is Glen doing here?

20:23.205 --> 20:24.705
I may or may not
have invited him.

20:24.799 --> 20:27.616
I thought that the two of you
had some stuff to clear up.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.209
Kat, I am mortified.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.394
I got to pee, so...

20:30.596 --> 20:31.562
Oh, no, no!

20:32.398 --> 20:34.899
-Hey, Phil.
-Oh, Glen. Hey!

20:35.050 --> 20:37.401
-(chuckles)
-What was that quote

20:37.628 --> 20:39.237
you said to me
at the bowling alley?

20:39.464 --> 20:41.814
(laughing): Oh, um...

20:41.908 --> 20:44.467
"They drummed you right out
of Hollywood,

20:44.560 --> 20:47.578
so you come crawling back
to Broadway."

20:47.730 --> 20:52.399
BOTH:
"But Broadway doesn't go
for booze and dope."

20:52.418 --> 20:55.327

y'all!
