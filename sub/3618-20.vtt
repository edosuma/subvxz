00:08.542 --> 00:10.215
<i>Welcome back to Witch Wars.</i>

00:10.462 --> 00:13.775
<i>Tonight, on a very special episode,
you'll see the ultimate battle</i>

00:14.093 --> 00:17.406
<i>when the gamemasters themselves
take on not just any witches,</i>

00:17.726 --> 00:20.686
<i>but the legendary Charmed Ones.</i>

00:21.481 --> 00:22.995
It'll be winner takes all,

00:23.234 --> 00:27.788
and we will take all.
Their lives, their powers,

00:28.160 --> 00:32.634
and last but not least,
their progeny.

00:39.262 --> 00:41.824
Sorry I'm late. I'm not moving
real fast these days.

00:42.101 --> 00:44.617
Are you sure you don't wanna be
born any time soon already?

00:44.898 --> 00:46.970
- Don't be in such a hurry.
- I hate to rush things,

00:47.234 --> 00:49.545
but what do you say we get this
family meeting started?

00:49.822 --> 00:52.622
You know, you could cut back
on those triple lattes a little bit.

00:52.913 --> 00:54.142
Hey, where's Leo?

00:54.374 --> 00:55.694
He's on the witch killer path,

00:55.918 --> 00:58.435
which you all should be
focusing on as well.

00:58.716 --> 01:02.029
We actually have bigger things
to deal with, Gideon.

01:02.346 --> 01:04.259
Like trying to figure out
who's after Wyatt.

01:04.559 --> 01:07.359
And I think I might
have an angle on that.

01:07.690 --> 01:10.126
- You found the demon?
- It may not be a demon.

01:10.445 --> 01:14.042
Look, we've relied on magic
all this time and it's gotten us nowhere.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.878
And since I can't rely on
my premonitions to help,

01:17.412 --> 01:20.248
I've had to resort to statistics.

01:20.587 --> 01:22.340
- Statistics?
- Yes.

01:22.631 --> 01:25.068
Did you know that 50 percent
of violent crimes

01:25.386 --> 01:27.424
are perpetrated by
someone the victim knew?

01:27.723 --> 01:28.999
So don't you see?

01:29.267 --> 01:30.940
Whoever turns Wyatt evil
might actually be

01:31.189 --> 01:32.908
someone we know
or even care about.

01:33.150 --> 01:34.824
A mortal? Impossible.

01:35.070 --> 01:37.950
Really? Because the crime reporter
at the newspaper

01:38.241 --> 01:40.678
said that it's usually someone
you least expect.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.139
All right, now you're
making me nervous.

01:44.086 --> 01:48.765
Phoebe, this theory might make
sense in the lives of normal people,

01:49.136 --> 01:51.526
but you aren't normal people.

01:51.849 --> 01:53.727
There's an entire underworld
of demons out there

01:53.977 --> 01:56.413
who want you dead,
and today is no exception,

01:56.691 --> 01:59.161
which brings me back
to the witch killer.

02:00.323 --> 02:02.998
Hold up, Phoebe's
onto something here.

02:03.285 --> 02:06.438
I mean, we've practically overturned
every demonic stone, right?

02:06.791 --> 02:08.747
- At least this is new.
- I don't believe this.

02:09.047 --> 02:10.401
Someone is killing witches,

02:10.674 --> 02:14.635
possibly as we speak.
How is that not your only priority?

02:15.015 --> 02:16.529
Because we're running out of time.

02:17.646 --> 02:19.205
What do you mean? Why?

02:20.151 --> 02:22.348
- I should have told you sooner.
- Told us what?

02:22.656 --> 02:24.932
What happens to Wyatt
happens before I'm born.

02:25.244 --> 02:28.238
- What?
- And you're just telling us this now?

02:28.581 --> 02:30.699
I thought I'd given myself
enough time. I'm so sorry.

02:31.836 --> 02:35.674
Then how do we know
that this witch killer

02:36.054 --> 02:37.454
isn't the one that's after Wyatt?

02:38.474 --> 02:41.389
Given this new information,
it seems to time out properly.

02:43.108 --> 02:45.258
Okay, it's time
to divide and conquer.

02:45.570 --> 02:47.961
Paige and Chris,
you help Leo with the witch killer.

02:48.242 --> 02:50.712
I'm gonna go chase my theory.
And Piper, you don't worry.

02:50.997 --> 02:52.477
We're gonna find
this guy, I promise.

03:08.527 --> 03:10.359
Is something wrong, sir?

03:11.408 --> 03:13.001
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.

03:13.703 --> 03:16.936
I think they're just about
to figure us out.

04:28.377 --> 04:30.096
What'd I ever do to you?

04:30.381 --> 04:31.861
You're sure he's a demon, right?

04:32.134 --> 04:35.208
That give you the right to commit
unprovoked violence against me?

04:38.435 --> 04:40.746
Tell us everything about the witches
that were murdered.

04:41.065 --> 04:42.420
I don't know anything, I swear.

04:47.868 --> 04:49.064
Oh, the witches.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.926
Well, the one last night,
she put on a great show.

04:52.209 --> 04:56.285
She shot fire from her hands
and she put up a great fight.

05:00.683 --> 05:02.915
Why did you just do that?
He was just starting to talk.

05:03.228 --> 05:07.589
He was lying. A, there was no witch
murdered last night, and B...

05:09.117 --> 05:10.597
Another witch was killed last night.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.423
- You were saying?
- That's a coincidence.

05:13.666 --> 05:15.943
There's no way he could have
been there to see that.

05:16.255 --> 05:17.974
Did she shoot fire
out of her hands?

05:18.257 --> 05:20.215
Yeah, how did you know?

05:20.512 --> 05:22.026
More to the point, how did he know?

05:22.557 --> 05:24.675
Maybe he was working for
an upper-level demon.

05:24.977 --> 05:28.336
Oh, right, we just happened to trap
the apprentice to the exact demon

05:28.649 --> 05:31.688
that we're trying to catch
and know nothing about.

05:32.031 --> 05:35.230
- What are we talking about?
- Paige vanquished our lucky break.

05:35.579 --> 05:38.220
- You don't know that.
- What do we know?

05:38.542 --> 05:42.379
Well, we know that one demon can't
possibly be doing all of these killings,

05:42.716 --> 05:45.551
so I'm thinking that someone
is getting demons to join forces.

05:45.847 --> 05:47.999
You think somebody
is trying to organize the underworld?

05:48.269 --> 05:52.663
Seems like it. And unfortunately,
I seem to be the only person

05:53.025 --> 05:54.983
concerned about the fact
that Phoebe is out there,

05:55.237 --> 05:57.070
roaming around in the world
without any powers.

05:57.367 --> 05:59.803
Without her active powers.
She can still cast spells.

06:00.122 --> 06:01.841
Right, so when
a demon attacks her,

06:02.083 --> 06:05.078
let's hope that Phoebe can come up
with a little rhyme just in time.

06:05.422 --> 06:07.334
No, no, no. I'm gonna go
bring her some potions.

06:07.635 --> 06:11.027
- Well, what should we do?
- Pray that she doesn't get attacked.

06:17.234 --> 06:19.750
- And what do I get out of it?
- Fame, glory,

06:20.031 --> 06:21.625
the respect of the entire underworld.

06:21.868 --> 06:24.429
And, of course,
the powers of the witch you kill.

06:24.707 --> 06:26.460
If you win.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.464
If I play, I'll win.

06:28.716 --> 06:31.676
A demon of your considerable power,
we have no doubt.

06:31.971 --> 06:35.091
As long as it's entertaining.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.514
Just out of curiosity, how did you
come up with the idea anyway?

06:38.818 --> 06:40.046
We can't take all the credit.

06:40.278 --> 06:43.032
You'd think demons would
have invented reality television,

06:43.324 --> 06:44.724
but somehow humans beat us to it.

06:44.952 --> 06:47.421
Still, it's the best idea we ever stole.

06:47.707 --> 06:51.304
And demons everywhere love
to watch. So if you're ready to play,

06:51.631 --> 06:55.104
just draw your blood
and sign on the dotted line.

06:55.429 --> 06:57.660
Draw my blood? Why?

06:57.932 --> 07:00.846
So that your powers, should you for
any reason lose, will revert to us.

07:01.190 --> 07:04.105
My powers? You gotta be kidding me.
There's no way I'm signing...

07:04.403 --> 07:05.962
I thought you were planning to win.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.756
And if you don't, you'll be dead.
You won't need your powers.

07:09.035 --> 07:10.755
But it doesn't mean
I want you to have them.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.543
It's quite a racket
you got going on here.

07:13.837 --> 07:16.193
Get all these guys to sign
their powers over to you,

07:16.465 --> 07:19.665
and then risk their lives all for some
chance to kill some stupid witch?

07:20.013 --> 07:23.326
No, the witch is not the point.
The point is fame. The point is...

07:23.686 --> 07:25.405
Fortune. Yeah, I got it.

07:25.650 --> 07:28.849
That may work on the silly morons
you have playing this game so far,

07:29.197 --> 07:31.667
but it won't work on me.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.511
If we don't get
an upper-level demon,

07:34.746 --> 07:36.339
we will never collect
the powers we need.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.702
We just have to be patient.
As the game gains in popularity,

07:40.006 --> 07:42.522
more and more powerful demons
will want to play.

07:42.803 --> 07:43.792
How do you know?

07:44.013 --> 07:46.085
Because if human beings
are foaming at the mouth

07:46.350 --> 07:49.742
to humiliate themselves on national
television, and they are,

07:50.065 --> 07:52.740
then demons are an easy mark.

07:53.031 --> 07:55.467
Upper-level humans?

07:56.121 --> 07:59.399
Donald Trump has his own show.

08:00.334 --> 08:02.931
Just be patient, my love.

08:03.214 --> 08:07.291
And together,
we'll rule the underworld.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.033
It's an old goal, but a good one.

08:12.857 --> 08:16.534
Disarm and I will reveal myself.

08:22.207 --> 08:23.926
- What is that, an Elder?
- Kill him.

08:24.168 --> 08:25.568
What I have to offer

08:25.838 --> 08:31.235
is far better than anything
my death will ever bring you.

08:35.772 --> 08:40.451
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you again.
You seem super busy.

08:40.864 --> 08:43.221
- You're always super busy.
- That's why I chose crime beat.

08:43.494 --> 08:45.691
So many bad guys,
I knew I'd never be out of work.

08:47.543 --> 08:49.775
That's funny. You are funny.

08:51.759 --> 08:53.954
Thanks for those statistics,
they really helped me.

08:54.263 --> 08:56.381
- Are you flirting with me?
- What?

08:56.643 --> 08:58.476
When a woman who looks like you
flirts with me,

08:58.729 --> 08:59.959
it means they want something.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.101
Okay. Yeah, you got me.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.400
I'm interested in dedicating
a month of my column

09:07.662 --> 09:09.096
to the protection of our children.

09:09.373 --> 09:12.526
And I was sort of wondering,
you know, if something,

09:12.880 --> 09:16.398
God forbid, were to happen
to my nephew Wyatt,

09:16.719 --> 09:19.758
what do you think the police might do
to try to figure out who did it?

09:20.103 --> 09:22.937
- They'd make a flow chart.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, a what?

09:23.275 --> 09:26.075
You do realize that
I'm on a deadline here, right?

09:27.573 --> 09:29.326
Should I go back to the flirting?

09:30.161 --> 09:32.631
- I guess I could use some coffee.
- That's great.

09:32.959 --> 09:35.714
You're great. I'm buying.

09:36.548 --> 09:38.028
- Oh, my God.
- What?

09:38.301 --> 09:41.454
You gotta just give me one second.

09:46.147 --> 09:47.183
Have you lost your mind?

09:47.440 --> 09:49.160
No, another witch
was killed last night.

09:49.444 --> 09:50.878
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

09:51.113 --> 09:52.547
And she had active powers.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.022
So I need you to go home
where I can keep an eye on you.

09:55.288 --> 09:57.520
Paige, you're my baby sister,
not my babysitter.

09:57.834 --> 09:59.747
Oh, that's clever. You're very clever.

10:00.046 --> 10:02.721
I'm glad while I'm panicking
you have the time to be clever.

10:03.009 --> 10:06.766
Okay, it's sweet that you're worried.
I'm fine, and have a lot of work to do.

10:07.141 --> 10:09.213
- Do your work from home.
- I can't do it from home

10:09.520 --> 10:11.592
because Kyle Donie is not at home.

10:12.235 --> 10:15.195
Who's Kyle Donie?
Is this about a guy?

10:15.531 --> 10:18.127
No, it's not about a guy,
it's about a reporter.

10:18.411 --> 10:21.929
One who knows everything there is
to know about criminal investigation.

10:22.251 --> 10:25.724
Since we don't have Darryl's help
anymore, he's the only resource I have.

10:26.092 --> 10:31.294
Fine. Explosive, acid, smoke bomb.
Use them.

10:31.726 --> 10:33.365
Thanks, Mom.

10:38.613 --> 10:40.287
Okay, where were we?

10:40.534 --> 10:42.970
Oh, you were flirting with me poorly,

10:43.290 --> 10:45.407
and I was helping you
find your bad guy.

10:47.589 --> 10:49.547
If I could find you through
my demonic contacts,

10:49.802 --> 10:52.399
then how long do you think it'll be
before the Charmed Ones

10:52.724 --> 10:54.363
find you and shut you down?

10:54.644 --> 10:59.038
They know about the witch killings,
so it's really only a matter of time.

10:59.443 --> 11:00.797
And you're here to warn us?

11:01.073 --> 11:02.905
No, I'm here to help you.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.432
Now, why don't I believe that?

11:05.705 --> 11:08.379
I need the Charmed Ones
distracted for a while

11:08.710 --> 11:11.431
whilst I accomplish
an important mission.

11:11.757 --> 11:14.319
I thought your game might be
the perfect thing.

11:14.638 --> 11:16.391
You want us to target
the Charmed Ones?

11:16.683 --> 11:18.834
No, I want you to use them.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.298
Make them your next stunt,
if you will.

11:21.566 --> 11:23.637
We'll plant a witch in their care,

11:23.944 --> 11:26.141
have her be the next target
in your game.

11:26.450 --> 11:29.762
Your contestants will have to
get past them to get to her.

11:30.082 --> 11:31.675
Get past the power of three?

11:31.917 --> 11:34.069
That's a suicide mission.
No one will sign up.

11:34.338 --> 11:36.809
The power of three isn't a factor
because Piper is convalescing

11:37.093 --> 11:39.849
at my school for the duration
of her pregnancy.

11:40.183 --> 11:41.583
It would draw upper-level demons.

11:41.852 --> 11:43.366
I don't trust him.

11:43.605 --> 11:45.483
Why would an Elder
sacrifice an innocent witch

11:45.732 --> 11:47.051
or put the Charmed Ones
in danger?

11:47.276 --> 11:51.671
I don't, and that's part of the deal.
There will be no blood drawn.

11:52.076 --> 11:54.228
You will set up a series of tasks.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.851
Have the demons... Oh, I don't know,

11:57.127 --> 11:59.563
steal something from the witch
to begin with.

11:59.841 --> 12:01.240
Let it escalate from there.

12:01.510 --> 12:02.499
Steal something?

12:02.719 --> 12:07.592
If you kill innocents,
or in any way harm Charmed Ones,

12:08.567 --> 12:11.527
then your game will be over
and you will be dead.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.964
- Understand?
- We don't take kindly to threats, Elder.

12:19.585 --> 12:23.901
How would we put the witch target
into their care,

12:24.259 --> 12:27.698
or, say, put them under surveillance?

12:28.016 --> 12:29.576
Get the contestants ready.

12:29.812 --> 12:33.490
Put a witch under non-lethal attack
and I'll take care of the rest.

12:35.656 --> 12:37.170
The cameras?

12:59.781 --> 13:01.420
- Clever.
- Thanks.

13:03.661 --> 13:05.335
Don't disappoint me.

13:10.550 --> 13:12.382
What's the matter with you?
Why do you trust him?

13:12.637 --> 13:15.597
I don't. But with all the powers that
we'll get from the demons who sign up,

13:15.893 --> 13:19.525
we'll have more than enough
to kill him when the time comes.

13:19.898 --> 13:22.175
As well as the Charmed Ones.

13:28.247 --> 13:30.204
So, what is it we're looking for?

13:30.459 --> 13:32.895
Any demon powerful enough
to be organizing the underworld,

13:33.174 --> 13:34.495
or any demon who might be running

13:34.718 --> 13:36.756
some sort of training camp
for younger demons,

13:37.014 --> 13:41.694
- or any demon that could be...
- So basically any demon.

13:42.608 --> 13:44.167
Yeah.

13:47.241 --> 13:48.675
This sucks, you know that?

13:48.952 --> 13:50.785
We're running out of time
and we've got nothing,

13:51.040 --> 13:52.520
repeat, nothing to go on.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.669
We've faced worse.

13:55.587 --> 13:57.101
What's worse than not knowing?

13:57.382 --> 13:59.419
For over a year now,
I've been looking.

13:59.721 --> 14:02.601
And you didn't know this deadline
was looming, but I did.

14:03.601 --> 14:06.437
I knew every single day.

14:07.901 --> 14:11.100
- That's why I was never able to relax.
- Why didn't you tell us?

14:11.450 --> 14:13.885
Because I didn't wanna
get you involved.

14:16.668 --> 14:18.148
I was trying to protect you.

14:18.419 --> 14:21.652
Chris, we're your parents.

14:21.966 --> 14:25.324
We're supposed to protect you,
not the other way around.

14:28.103 --> 14:30.983
Hey, I got a new scrying crystal.

14:31.275 --> 14:34.314
Amethyst. I thought we could use
the extra power boost.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.170
What exactly are we scrying for?

14:36.452 --> 14:37.602
Witches under attack.

14:37.871 --> 14:39.591
I don't want any more getting killed.

14:39.875 --> 14:43.153
And that includes my sister, who's
now determined to stay at the office

14:43.505 --> 14:46.817
ever since your son
dropped his little bomb this morning.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.247
I already said I was sorry.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.028
And he shouldn't have to say it again.

14:51.144 --> 14:52.260
All right, Dad.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.061
Gideon, what are you doing here?
Is Piper okay?

14:56.363 --> 14:57.956
Hardly.

14:58.242 --> 15:01.999
Thanks to Phoebe's ludicrous theory,
everybody's a suspect in her mind.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.085
She's terrorizing the entire school.

15:04.378 --> 15:05.778
So you want me to talk to her?

15:06.047 --> 15:08.244
I'd be eternally grateful.

15:12.766 --> 15:13.996
What are you scrying for?

15:14.226 --> 15:16.423
Witches under attack.

15:20.447 --> 15:21.642
Got one, in the Mission.

15:21.907 --> 15:23.945
You should both go. Hurry.

15:54.174 --> 15:56.166
No. Help!

15:58.138 --> 15:59.368
That what you were hoping for?

16:07.903 --> 16:09.258
Hey, help me!

16:12.203 --> 16:14.196
Got it.

16:15.918 --> 16:17.511
Damn it.

16:17.798 --> 16:20.393
- What the hell just happened?
- I don't know.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.478
Wait, who are you?

16:22.724 --> 16:24.637
We're the Charmed... One.

16:24.893 --> 16:27.649
Come on, I'll take you
somewhere safe, okay?

16:29.902 --> 16:31.098
Where are we?

16:31.323 --> 16:34.237
It's okay, you're gonna be safe here.
What's your name, anyway?

16:34.536 --> 16:36.335
I'm Tali.

16:36.581 --> 16:39.462
How can I ever thank you guys
for saving me?

16:39.754 --> 16:43.227
Okay, I don't think you need to
because I don't think we did.

16:43.552 --> 16:45.351
I'm not even sure
they were after you.

16:45.598 --> 16:47.317
Yeah, they were after your necklace.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.678
Oh, my grandmother's amulet.

16:49.938 --> 16:53.535
Amulet? Is it magical?
Does it have any power?

16:53.902 --> 16:56.213
<i>No. No, not at all.</i>

16:56.492 --> 16:58.085
<i>This is all very strange.</i>

16:58.328 --> 17:03.087
Wait, this thing is powerless?
Then why did you want us to steal it?

17:03.461 --> 17:06.058
It got the Charmed Ones involved,
didn't it?

17:06.342 --> 17:07.935
So when do we get
our shot at them?

17:08.178 --> 17:11.651
<i>Be patient, this was only round one.</i>

17:11.977 --> 17:14.013
<i>Stay tuned.</i>

17:19.656 --> 17:22.455
Yeah!

17:25.876 --> 17:29.076
Mrs. Winterbourne?
Hold it right there.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.418
Well, hi, Wyatt. Hi, Piper.

17:32.763 --> 17:34.834
Never mind that. I just wanted
you to know that Wyatt

17:35.102 --> 17:39.222
will not be in your class tomorrow,
or ever again for that matter.

17:39.609 --> 17:40.883
Why? Is there a problem?

17:41.152 --> 17:43.304
A problem? You mean like when
Wyatt was playing with

17:43.573 --> 17:45.644
that little girl at the Play-Doh table
this morning?

17:45.954 --> 17:48.471
You mean Emily?
She's such a sweet, little psychic.

17:48.794 --> 17:51.708
She stole his dough
right out of his hands.

17:52.049 --> 17:53.848
And you did absolutely nothing.

17:54.135 --> 17:56.526
Well, stole is a little harsh,
don't you think?

17:56.849 --> 17:57.998
She's only two years old.

17:58.226 --> 18:00.104
No, that's not the point.

18:00.398 --> 18:03.676
What message is this sending him,
that people can just take from him?

18:04.030 --> 18:05.099
That people can hurt him,

18:05.321 --> 18:08.156
that grown adults will not be there
to protect him?

18:08.493 --> 18:09.767
- Piper.
- What?

18:10.037 --> 18:11.311
We need to talk.

18:11.582 --> 18:14.222
Would you mind taking Wyatt for
a stroll just for a minute, please?

18:14.504 --> 18:15.824
What?!

18:16.842 --> 18:18.322
It's all right, go ahead.

18:18.553 --> 18:22.435
I'll be right over there.
Come on, let's go.

18:24.647 --> 18:25.843
Are you out of your mind?

18:26.066 --> 18:29.584
Piper, do you realize you're driving
everybody nuts around here?

18:29.906 --> 18:32.900
Well, I don't really care, because,
see, I'm trying to protect our son.

18:33.203 --> 18:35.115
From who, his
"Mommy & Me" teacher?

18:35.373 --> 18:38.492
Hey, how do you not know
that she's the one who's after him?

18:38.796 --> 18:40.709
- If Phoebe's right...
- She's not.

18:41.009 --> 18:42.238
How do you know?

18:42.470 --> 18:45.066
Because why would anybody
we know want to turn Wyatt evil?

18:45.349 --> 18:47.911
It just doesn't make any sense,
just like Gideon said.

18:48.229 --> 18:51.907
How do you know it's not him?
Or us for that matter?

18:52.279 --> 18:53.554
- Piper.
- No, I'm serious.

18:53.824 --> 18:56.898
What if he saw what this life
did to us, and how hard it was,

18:57.203 --> 18:59.161
and just decided to
take the easy way out.

18:59.457 --> 19:01.130
- It's not what happened.
- How do you know?

19:01.419 --> 19:03.935
Because Wyatt
is surrounded by love.

19:04.259 --> 19:06.979
We love him,
whether we're together or not.

19:07.305 --> 19:09.900
He's got a brother that risked
everything just to save his life.

19:10.229 --> 19:13.223
Plus he's got two aunts who would
rather gouge out their own eyes

19:13.526 --> 19:15.245
than see anything bad
happen to him.

19:21.748 --> 19:23.866
Just promise me
we'll keep him safe.

19:24.878 --> 19:26.279
I promise.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.762
That's him, the Brute Demon.

19:34.021 --> 19:37.060
Okay, upper-level demons
with overwhelming physical strength.

19:37.401 --> 19:40.395
They work alone, generally
crushing skulls of their victims.

19:41.368 --> 19:43.280
You're lucky he wasn't after you.

19:44.623 --> 19:46.023
Okay, this isn't making sense.

19:46.251 --> 19:49.690
Are you sure that that amulet
did not have magical powers?

19:50.048 --> 19:53.042
I'm positive.
It was just a family heirloom.

19:53.389 --> 19:55.220
Do you have anything else
of your grandmother's?

19:55.475 --> 19:57.832
Her wedding ring, why?

19:58.146 --> 20:00.502
That's a great idea.
We can use it to scry for the amulet.

20:00.817 --> 20:03.333
- Find out where the demon went.
- Okay, people, heads up.

20:03.613 --> 20:06.005
I need your address books,
your phone books, all your books.

20:06.286 --> 20:07.402
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Hi.

20:07.622 --> 20:10.696
This is Tali. She was attacked
by three upper-level demons today.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.879
Wow, and you lived to tell about it?
Congratulations.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.887
About those books?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

20:16.134 --> 20:18.013
Phoebe, we actually need your help.

20:20.268 --> 20:21.257
How bad was it?

20:21.520 --> 20:23.955
Well, they stole
my grandmother's amulet.

20:24.274 --> 20:27.313
Really, how powerful was it?
Could they use it for mind control?

20:27.613 --> 20:30.004
Oh, no, it was just decorative.

20:30.284 --> 20:31.843
Decorative.

20:32.122 --> 20:33.715
Yeah, pretty much.

20:34.001 --> 20:37.076
Saving my nephew
or kleptomaniac demons?

20:37.423 --> 20:39.016
I really need those books, guys.

20:39.259 --> 20:41.297
- Pheeb.
- What? This is important.

20:41.556 --> 20:44.071
I'm gonna draw a police flow chart
of everyone in Wyatt's life

20:44.353 --> 20:47.348
who can possibly be a suspect
and I don't wanna forget anybody.

20:47.650 --> 20:49.005
Fine, my book is in my bedroom.

20:49.236 --> 20:50.591
Mom's is down in the kitchen.

20:50.864 --> 20:53.255
- Great. I hope you find your amulet.
- Thank you.

20:53.536 --> 20:54.605
I'll be at the office.

20:54.871 --> 20:55.861
<i>But please don't need me,</i>

20:56.081 --> 20:58.803
<i>because I really think
I'm onto something here.</i>

20:59.130 --> 21:00.689
Stubborn little witch.

21:03.803 --> 21:05.317
She's not playing along.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.747
What if she finds us out?

21:07.017 --> 21:08.656
- She won't.
- How are you gonna stop her?

21:12.778 --> 21:14.371
Thanks for sharing.

21:21.084 --> 21:22.678
Athames?

21:22.921 --> 21:25.039
I thought we'd agreed
nobody would be hurt.

21:25.342 --> 21:27.812
The weapons are part of the game.
It's how powers are taken.

21:28.095 --> 21:30.612
Don't worry, only the players
will be using them on each other.

21:30.893 --> 21:33.203
More dead demons?
Not a problem for me.

21:33.521 --> 21:36.356
More dead Elders wouldn't be
a problem for us either.

21:36.695 --> 21:39.052
- What do you want?
- This whole distraction

21:39.366 --> 21:42.759
isn't working as well as I'd hoped,
especially not on Phoebe.

21:43.122 --> 21:44.681
She's meeting with
the reporter again,

21:44.959 --> 21:47.954
and I won't have him feeding her
any more information.

21:48.298 --> 21:49.812
You want him dead?

21:50.094 --> 21:52.930
No, of course not.
I want him out of the way.

21:53.265 --> 21:54.461
How are we supposed to do that?

21:54.684 --> 21:57.917
Be creative. Plant more cameras,
make him part of the game.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.252
Use the Shapeshifter. I like him.

22:02.618 --> 22:06.215
Still, he is a demon, which means
there's only so much we can control

22:06.540 --> 22:08.452
in the risk department.

22:08.711 --> 22:11.750
I expect you'll do your very best.

22:14.096 --> 22:16.407
Did he just give us an opening?

22:16.684 --> 22:19.120
He must be more desperate
than we thought, which means

22:19.395 --> 22:22.868
that maybe he won't shut us down
after the first witch dies.

22:28.536 --> 22:31.292
- Come on, get in there.
- Oh, man.

22:33.963 --> 22:35.522
Yeah!

22:38.137 --> 22:39.617
Next?

22:42.186 --> 22:43.302
All right, finally.

22:46.818 --> 22:48.377
<i>Witch Wars, yeah!</i>

22:48.654 --> 22:51.454
<i>Witch Wars!</i>

22:51.786 --> 22:55.303
<i>- Welcome back to Witch Wars.
- Nobody shushes me.</i>

22:56.920 --> 22:59.230
<i>You want battles,
you thirst for blood?</i>

22:59.507 --> 23:01.100
<i>You ain't seen nothing yet.</i>

23:01.344 --> 23:04.304
<i>Of course, that warlock won't be
seeing anything ever again, will he?</i>

23:05.476 --> 23:07.946
<i>In round two, these three
upper-level demons</i>

23:08.232 --> 23:10.622
<i>will again have to get past the
Charmed Ones to get the witch.</i>

23:10.901 --> 23:13.702
<i>But this time they're not going
after her necklace,</i>

23:13.990 --> 23:15.947
<i>they're going after her life.</i>

23:16.246 --> 23:18.716
Before we get started, let's introduce
our newest contestant.

23:18.999 --> 23:21.755
He's a darklighter all the way
from the Northeast underworld.

23:22.092 --> 23:24.242
- Good to have you with us.
- Good to be here.

23:24.553 --> 23:27.991
<i>Now remember,
your athames will absorb</i>

23:28.310 --> 23:32.864
<i>the powers of your victims
as well as each other.</i>

23:33.278 --> 23:35.589
<i>The last demon standing
will be awarded</i>

23:35.906 --> 23:38.183
<i>all of the powers
collected at the end.</i>

23:38.453 --> 23:40.012
<i>For the winner,</i>

23:40.289 --> 23:42.758
a serious power boost.

23:43.086 --> 23:46.364
For the losers, certain death.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.293
Oh, one more thing:

23:49.597 --> 23:52.716
<i>since the Shapeshifter
failed to get the witch's amulet</i>

23:53.019 --> 23:55.536
<i>at the end of round one,
he must now take on the added risk</i>

23:55.818 --> 23:59.449
of confronting a Charmed One
directly. In this case, Phoebe.

23:59.824 --> 24:01.338
Oh, great.

24:01.618 --> 24:03.736
And the Brute Demon,
having won round one

24:03.997 --> 24:06.832
by claiming the amulet, has won
the right to make the first move.

24:07.170 --> 24:08.843
<i>Yeah!</i>

24:09.132 --> 24:12.410
<i>Now the players will enter
the confessional cave</i>

24:12.722 --> 24:16.272
<i>to share their strategies
with the audience.</i>

24:21.029 --> 24:23.385
Let's watch.

24:25.659 --> 24:28.971
<i>One of the Charmed Ones is getting
ready to scry for the amulet, right?</i>

24:29.332 --> 24:32.805
<i>To find me. Good.
I'll be waiting for her.</i>

24:33.172 --> 24:37.567
<i>And when I take her out,
the witch will be mine.</i>

24:39.350 --> 24:41.866
<i>It's suicide to go up
against a Charmed One.</i>

24:42.188 --> 24:48.108
<i>But if I could persuade Phoebe
to invite me home with her,</i>

24:48.535 --> 24:51.256
<i>she'd be leading me
right to the witch.</i>

24:51.790 --> 24:53.748
<i>All I gotta do is bide my time,</i>

24:54.587 --> 24:58.264
<i>wait for that stupid Brute
to get himself killed,</i>

24:59.429 --> 25:01.467
<i>then make my move.</i>

25:01.975 --> 25:03.968
Okay, so we have
the immediate family

25:04.229 --> 25:07.462
and then the close friends of
the family. Who's next?

25:07.777 --> 25:10.657
Anyone the child originally came
in contact with in the last six months.

25:10.950 --> 25:14.946
Okay, but the child's been
in seclusion for the last six months.

25:15.290 --> 25:18.365
So are we talking kids in the nursery,
and teachers?

25:18.670 --> 25:21.790
And his mother's hairdresser,
or your handyman, or clergyman.

25:22.093 --> 25:24.815
Okay, let's just say,
hypothetically speaking,

25:25.100 --> 25:26.739
that the police
are running out of time.

25:27.019 --> 25:30.570
They can't research everyone
the child's met in the last six months.

25:30.943 --> 25:33.095
- Who do they focus on then?
- Immediate family.

25:33.405 --> 25:35.044
They've ruled out
the immediate family.

25:35.284 --> 25:38.005
Okay, I kind of preferred
the fake flirting to this.

25:38.332 --> 25:40.767
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just get very emotional

25:41.044 --> 25:42.478
when things have to do
with my family.

25:42.713 --> 25:46.105
Well, that's why the cops usually
do this part and not the parents.

25:46.428 --> 25:48.021
Or the aunt.

25:48.307 --> 25:50.458
Okay, so, what would
the cops do next?

25:50.727 --> 25:53.324
It sounds to me like you're looking
for some kind of magic formula,

25:53.607 --> 25:54.643
and there just isn't one.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.734
Can't you just narrow it down
a little bit?

25:57.030 --> 26:00.263
Well, statistically,
when it's not a crime of necessity,

26:00.578 --> 26:03.094
you're looking at white men
between the ages of 25 and 50,

26:03.417 --> 26:04.897
usually someone you'd least expect.

26:05.170 --> 26:06.889
Maybe... Maybe even trust.

26:08.216 --> 26:09.889
Think on that. I'll get coffee.

26:35.889 --> 26:36.880
Making any progress?

26:37.143 --> 26:39.294
No, not yet. I thought you were
getting coffee.

26:39.605 --> 26:42.361
<i>I changed my mind.
If I have caffeine this late,</i>

26:42.694 --> 26:46.976
- I can't sleep.
- Not gonna sleep until I figure this out.

26:50.165 --> 26:51.485
Hey, how's it going here?

26:51.711 --> 26:53.988
Paige and Tali went
to get her grandmother's ring.

26:54.257 --> 26:55.372
How's Mom doing?

26:55.593 --> 26:56.582
She's scared.

26:57.346 --> 26:58.575
She's holding up.

26:58.847 --> 26:59.997
And how are you doing?

27:00.266 --> 27:01.825
About the same.

27:05.192 --> 27:07.469
- Got it.
- So, what are you planning to do

27:07.780 --> 27:08.850
when you find them?

27:09.116 --> 27:11.154
I mean, could this be
some kind of trap?

27:12.204 --> 27:14.162
Honey, it can always be
some kind of a trap.

27:14.417 --> 27:15.737
You shouldn't go alone.

27:16.003 --> 27:18.963
He's right, Paige.
If these are the witch killers...

27:19.301 --> 27:21.497
- I got it.
- Why don't you guys go with her?

27:21.805 --> 27:23.080
If they wanted to kill me,

27:23.348 --> 27:26.229
they would have done it
when they had the chance. Right?

27:26.520 --> 27:28.672
No, I'm sorry.
I can't leave you unprotected.

27:28.983 --> 27:30.940
I'll stay.

27:31.239 --> 27:32.719
Come on.

27:41.299 --> 27:43.815
Lambs to the slaughter.

27:55.031 --> 27:56.466
Okay, that looks like a trap.

27:56.701 --> 27:57.852
Let's get out of here.

28:06.176 --> 28:07.815
Told you he'd eat it.

28:08.055 --> 28:09.455
That's gonna leave a mark.

28:13.939 --> 28:15.818
What's that?

28:17.110 --> 28:19.103
That's us.

28:23.540 --> 28:26.454
<i>Then you gotta keep going. Is there
any place where you can go...?</i>

28:26.795 --> 28:28.070
Okay, what's going on?

28:31.637 --> 28:32.991
Chris.

28:39.733 --> 28:42.328
I win, you lose.

28:42.655 --> 28:46.571
Darklighter! Darklighter! Darklighter!

28:54.175 --> 28:56.897
I am so sorry,
I didn't even see him coming.

28:57.181 --> 28:59.822
It's okay, it's not your fault.
We're being watched.

29:00.147 --> 29:01.467
What?

29:01.733 --> 29:04.568
Sons of bitches,
where are the cameras?

29:04.905 --> 29:06.133
What cameras?

29:06.407 --> 29:08.604
There's some live feed going on
with the crystals.

29:08.870 --> 29:11.705
Yeah, except for I think they cut it off.
I'm not seeing anything.

29:12.043 --> 29:13.397
- Well, who?
- I don't know.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.985
I vanquished the Brute Demon
before I could ask him.

29:16.300 --> 29:17.939
What is this, some kind of game?

29:19.555 --> 29:20.989
Actually, it might be.

29:22.269 --> 29:23.339
What are you talking about?

29:23.981 --> 29:26.257
Well, I heard something,
when I was down in the underworld.

29:26.527 --> 29:29.089
- But I thought it was a rumour.
- You thought what was a rumour?

29:29.365 --> 29:31.676
Well, that there was this
demonic game show.

29:31.993 --> 29:34.714
<i>Kind of like Survivor
but only for demons.</i>

29:34.998 --> 29:36.991
And you didn't tell us this why?

29:37.253 --> 29:38.892
Because I didn't think
it was relevant.

29:39.174 --> 29:41.166
That's your theme song
of today, did you notice?

29:41.761 --> 29:43.241
Paige.

29:44.892 --> 29:47.169
Look, I'm sorry.
Well, at least it explains

29:47.480 --> 29:49.676
how the demon we trapped today
knew that the witch died.

29:49.942 --> 29:53.301
He was watching it on TV.
Pretty sick.

29:53.657 --> 29:55.331
No sicker than any other
reality TV show.

29:57.121 --> 29:58.840
- I'm just saying.
- Except this one's about

29:59.125 --> 30:00.479
killing witches for entertainment.

30:00.752 --> 30:04.030
Yeah, we have to get out of here
because they are listening to us.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.779
<i>We're gonna find you.</i>

30:10.896 --> 30:12.170
We need more powers, fast.

30:12.399 --> 30:16.077
Don't worry. Cue the confessional.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.801
<i>One demon down, one to go.</i>

30:27.134 --> 30:29.731
All I have to do is wait for Phoebe
to kill the Shapeshifter.

30:30.014 --> 30:31.607
Then I can make my move.

30:31.851 --> 30:33.649
What if she doesn't?

30:33.896 --> 30:38.370
I mean, why wait? Why not just
eliminate the competition yourself?

30:40.116 --> 30:41.311
<i>Good point.</i>

30:42.872 --> 30:46.469
A reality what?
You have got to be kidding me.

30:46.792 --> 30:48.624
All right. I'll be home
as soon as I can.

30:48.921 --> 30:51.232
- Is something wrong?
- Kind of.

30:51.551 --> 30:53.622
Listen, thanks. I have to get going.

30:53.930 --> 30:55.250
I was having a really good time.

30:56.685 --> 30:58.119
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:58.355 --> 31:01.235
Well, thanks again for all your help.
Maybe we can talk more tomorrow.

31:01.527 --> 31:05.761
Or since you're heading home,
I could just come with you.

31:06.161 --> 31:07.310
I'm sorry?

31:07.580 --> 31:11.701
To check out your place. Look for any,
you know, easy entry points.

31:12.086 --> 31:14.283
I mean, most bad guys
usually attack at home.

31:14.591 --> 31:16.470
Are you sure about that?
I think I read that...

31:16.720 --> 31:18.074
I'm the expert, right?

31:19.851 --> 31:23.403
So let me just come home with you,
make sure everything is all right.

31:23.774 --> 31:26.654
Yeah. Well, that's not gonna happen.

31:26.989 --> 31:28.423
See, I'm not going home.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.455
I have to go somewhere else...

31:31.789 --> 31:33.702
Take me to your house, witch. Now!

31:38.049 --> 31:39.324
Chris! Leo!

31:47.649 --> 31:48.799
Phoebe.

31:50.740 --> 31:52.379
You still alive?

31:55.541 --> 31:56.577
Oh, come on.

31:56.835 --> 31:58.189
Missed by that much.

32:09.189 --> 32:12.184
The witch is dead,
and I'm the last demon standing.

32:12.529 --> 32:15.250
<i>That's the game, my friends,
that is the game.</i>

32:15.575 --> 32:17.134
<i>Well, not quite.</i>

32:17.412 --> 32:18.766
What?

32:19.040 --> 32:25.564
As you know, all good reality TV
shows have one final twist.

32:28.305 --> 32:29.979
That's a cheat.

32:32.605 --> 32:36.520
Now, it's our turn to play.

32:40.995 --> 32:44.149
You gotta admit, it's a good twist.

32:50.303 --> 32:52.135
Found it.

32:52.389 --> 32:56.180
Power-sucking athame.

32:56.561 --> 32:57.712
And?

32:57.981 --> 32:59.574
Well, that's it.

32:59.819 --> 33:02.051
It doesn't say anything about
what kind of demon uses it

33:02.323 --> 33:03.803
or what the "WW" stands for?

33:04.034 --> 33:07.074
- No.
- Well, that's not a big help.

33:07.415 --> 33:11.331
Okay. Well, we could scry with
the athame or the crystal thingy.

33:11.673 --> 33:14.509
- No, I tried.
- How about a return-to-sender spell?

33:15.390 --> 33:17.063
Tried. Our magic is blocked.

33:18.394 --> 33:20.113
So then we've got nothing.

33:20.397 --> 33:22.994
Yes, we have nothing
but a houseful of cameras

33:23.318 --> 33:25.117
and an underworld full of voyeurs.

33:25.407 --> 33:28.083
Piper, why don't you go relax?
We can take it from here.

33:28.412 --> 33:32.489
No, I'm fine. I mean... And relax?
Relax where? We're being watched.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.598
Not here, not at magic school
they're not.

33:34.882 --> 33:37.682
Leo's right. You should go lay down.
We've got it under control.

33:39.474 --> 33:42.115
<i>You don't touch me.
You're the reason I look like this.</i>

33:50.451 --> 33:51.772
You have to put a stop to this.

33:52.037 --> 33:53.630
You're missing the bigger picture.

33:53.916 --> 33:57.149
- Sir, another witch is dead.
- That wasn't supposed to happen.

33:57.463 --> 33:59.296
You're dealing with demons,
what did you expect?

33:59.550 --> 34:02.305
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

34:02.639 --> 34:04.950
How far are you willing to go?
Phoebe was nearly killed.

34:05.228 --> 34:07.139
No, she wasn't. She's strong.

34:07.398 --> 34:09.310
She protected herself
as I knew she would.

34:09.609 --> 34:12.123
They weren't supposed to
go after the Charmed Ones.

34:12.447 --> 34:15.440
Yes, they were.
That was my plan all along.

34:15.786 --> 34:18.860
To get the gamesmasters
to try to kill the Charmed Ones.

34:19.210 --> 34:22.090
- But why?
- To get them off my trail.

34:22.590 --> 34:24.583
To get them believing
that it's the gamemasters

34:24.886 --> 34:27.322
who are after Wyatt, as if they've
been after him all along.

34:27.641 --> 34:30.443
What if they succeed?
What if they kill the sisters?

34:31.523 --> 34:33.755
I have no intention of letting
that happen.

34:34.069 --> 34:38.110
I only want Wyatt eliminated,
not them.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.974
I think I might have found something
that can help.

34:50.181 --> 34:51.377
It's the crystal thingy.

34:51.643 --> 34:53.442
It's an ancient form
of magical voyeurism.

34:53.690 --> 34:56.251
The Ronyx crystal.
It predates even the crystal ball.

34:56.570 --> 35:00.009
Our demon friends must have found
a way to put a new spin on an old idea.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.516
Wait a minute.

35:02.619 --> 35:05.534
It's got an incantation to activate it.

35:18.106 --> 35:19.586
<i>Welcome back to Witch Wars.</i>

35:19.817 --> 35:23.256
<i>Tonight, on a very special episode,
you'll see the ultimate battle</i>

35:23.574 --> 35:26.887
<i>when the gamemasters themselves
take on not just any witches,</i>

35:27.246 --> 35:28.919
<i>but the legendary Charmed Ones.</i>

35:31.045 --> 35:32.559
<i>It'll be winner takes all,</i>

35:32.799 --> 35:37.193
<i>and we will take all.
Their lives, their powers,</i>

35:37.598 --> 35:41.116
<i>and last but not least,
their progeny.</i>

35:46.907 --> 35:49.139
That's what their show is about,
killing us?

35:49.410 --> 35:51.845
Then either me or Wyatt.

35:52.123 --> 35:55.640
It has to be Wyatt. Which means...

35:56.924 --> 35:59.521
Oh, yes, this makes perfect sense.

36:00.930 --> 36:03.241
What about any of this
make perfect sense?

36:03.520 --> 36:04.556
Don't you see?

36:04.815 --> 36:08.810
These gamesmasters are the demons
you've been looking for all along.

36:09.198 --> 36:11.555
The ones who are after Wyatt.

36:11.869 --> 36:14.226
- What?
- They've been collecting powers,

36:14.541 --> 36:18.582
hoping to gain enough
to be able to collect yours.

36:18.964 --> 36:19.954
And then get Wyatt's.

36:20.215 --> 36:22.937
Well, it kind of fits in
with Phoebe's theory then.

36:23.265 --> 36:26.099
Right? We don't know who they are
but they know who we are.

36:26.436 --> 36:28.871
- I'm gonna kill them.
- No, Leo, you're an Elder now.

36:29.191 --> 36:30.590
Nonviolent, remember?

36:30.860 --> 36:32.214
Watch me.

36:32.488 --> 36:34.879
We're gonna have to find them first.

36:35.161 --> 36:37.277
Do you think we could trace
the signal back to them?

36:37.581 --> 36:40.097
No, not without Piper.
I think they're too strong already.

36:40.418 --> 36:43.059
No, we don't need Piper.

36:43.341 --> 36:44.410
Because we have this.

36:45.886 --> 36:48.243
And they're not gonna kill us on TV.

36:48.517 --> 36:50.553
We're gonna kill them.

36:51.522 --> 36:52.796
What if they never go back?

36:53.024 --> 36:55.459
They will. If there's one thing I know
about the Charmed Ones,

36:55.736 --> 36:58.651
they never run away from a fight.

36:59.076 --> 37:01.467
<i>- What exactly are we looking for?
- Anything that will let us</i>

37:01.748 --> 37:03.944
<i>vanquish the gamemasters
without the power of three.</i>

37:04.921 --> 37:06.913
It's showtime.

37:15.480 --> 37:16.595
Hi.

37:18.860 --> 37:20.692
Anybody wanna play a game?

37:28.881 --> 37:30.315
When are they coming back?

37:43.614 --> 37:46.733
Now that's good television.
Give me the athame.

37:47.036 --> 37:48.265
Are you sure about this?

37:48.539 --> 37:49.859
It's for Wyatt.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.707
Feels good to have powers again.

38:04.984 --> 38:06.100
Give him hell.

38:18.676 --> 38:20.030
This game's over.

38:20.637 --> 38:22.311
I couldn't agree more.

38:29.694 --> 38:31.686
<i>See what happens when you
make a play for our baby?</i>

38:31.990 --> 38:33.139
<i>Who wants to play next?</i>

38:37.625 --> 38:39.184
<i>What's the matter? Scared of me?</i>

38:42.175 --> 38:43.895
Well, are you? Are you?

39:02.713 --> 39:05.752
Looks like your show's
just been cancelled.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.673
- Where's Phoebe?
- That's a good question.

39:10.686 --> 39:11.755
God, that was great.

39:12.021 --> 39:14.982
I wanna kill somebody else.
Chris, find me another demon to kill.

39:15.316 --> 39:16.717
We gotta get these powers out.

39:16.985 --> 39:19.103
You're the one who wanted me
to have a power, remember?

39:19.408 --> 39:20.557
Yeah, not a demonic power.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.021
Beggars can't be choosers.

39:22.287 --> 39:26.409
Oh, poor little powerless Phoebe,
she can't even take care of herself.

39:27.421 --> 39:28.616
Okay, I'm sorry.

39:28.882 --> 39:31.558
I admit it, I was... I was wrong.

39:32.139 --> 39:33.858
Would you mind repeating that,
please?

39:34.142 --> 39:36.898
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

39:37.231 --> 39:39.188
I clearly underestimated you.

39:39.442 --> 39:41.913
You are very powerful.

39:42.238 --> 39:45.233
That's all I wanted to hear.
Now who wants to stab me?

39:45.537 --> 39:47.608
- What?
- The only way to get the powers out.

39:47.916 --> 39:49.430
Come on, I dare you.

39:49.710 --> 39:52.102
I double dare you.
I triple dare you. l...

39:52.423 --> 39:54.893
Stop, I'll stab her.
Leo, be ready to heal?

39:58.227 --> 40:01.266
- You stabbed her?
- Oh, you would have too.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.364
She was pretty obnoxious.

40:03.610 --> 40:06.205
Yeah, demonic powers
on an empty stomach.

40:06.490 --> 40:08.642
- Not such a good thing.
- No, it was a great thing.

40:08.911 --> 40:11.380
- You saved Wyatt.
- We all did.

40:11.666 --> 40:14.056
So we're 100 percent certain
these were the demons

40:14.378 --> 40:16.496
we were looking for all along?

40:16.802 --> 40:19.841
To our nephew,
may he always be safe.

40:21.895 --> 40:23.294
I can't believe it's finally over.

40:23.815 --> 40:26.205
Believe it. You just saved the future.

40:27.947 --> 40:29.700
- Mom.
- Yeah, I know.

40:39.633 --> 40:42.389
Sigmund, try to relax.
We were successful today.

40:42.722 --> 40:44.554
They're off our trail.

40:45.143 --> 40:49.059
Even better, their guard is down,
which makes it that much easier

40:49.401 --> 40:52.635
to eliminate the threat.

40:53.408 --> 40:54.683
His name is Wyatt.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.480
I'm sorry?

40:56.746 --> 40:58.100
What if Phoebe was right?

40:58.332 --> 41:00.973
What if future-Wyatt
wasn't turned evil by a demon?

41:01.297 --> 41:03.209
He's just an innocent baby.

41:03.509 --> 41:05.102
What if, in trying to
eliminate a threat,

41:05.345 --> 41:07.018
we are actually creating a monster?

41:07.766 --> 41:09.280
That's such a tender age
to be betrayed

41:09.562 --> 41:11.439
by those who have
sworn to protect you.

41:11.690 --> 41:13.009
What if that's what turns him?

41:13.276 --> 41:16.237
It's possible. Anything is possible.
But armed with this future knowledge,

41:16.573 --> 41:20.775
we have to try to make sure
that it doesn't happen this time.

41:21.163 --> 41:24.202
The only way to be sure
is to stop this now.

41:24.544 --> 41:28.505
Sigmund! This child
should never have been born.

41:28.886 --> 41:32.039
He is enormously dangerous.

41:32.349 --> 41:35.024
Why am I the only one who seems
to understand that?

41:35.898 --> 41:37.457
That's a very good question, sir.

41:37.735 --> 41:41.413
And with all due respect, it's why
I can't let you go through with this.

41:42.787 --> 41:44.586
I'm going to tell the sisters the truth.

42:09.709 --> 42:12.349
I'm sorry, old friend.

42:12.631 --> 42:16.388
But this too is for the greater good.

42:22.105 --> 42:23.176
Forgive me.
