00:15.822 --> 00:18.857
L.A. is like nowhere.

00:18.890 --> 00:21.456
Everybody who lives here is lost

00:36.278 --> 00:39.717
NOWHERE

02:23.768 --> 02:26.632
Hey, Dark.
- Hey what, Mel?

02:26.678 --> 02:28.905
You want me to?

02:35.314 --> 02:37.436
Well.

02:37.895 --> 02:40.796
Beg for it.

03:00.408 --> 03:04.460
Hi. My name's
Montgomery.

03:04.521 --> 03:08.959
Hi. - You have got the deepest,
blackest eyes I've ever seen.

03:10.025 --> 03:14.113
It's like I could just tumble
right into 'em, fall forever

03:20.809 --> 03:24.964
I just love the smell of fear and

03:24.965 --> 03:29.874
boy mixed together, don't you, Kriss?

03:35.278 --> 03:37.239
What're you gawking at?

03:37.284 --> 03:39.715
Looks like we've got a deviant
on our hands here, Kozy.

03:39.859 --> 03:42.740
And we just hate, hate, hate any

03:42.741 --> 03:45.802
sort of deviation from the norm.

03:45.815 --> 03:48.123
Deviants are the scourge

03:48.124 --> 03:51.296
contaminating this Great Nation

03:59.912 --> 04:02.031
Dark?

04:02.174 --> 04:05.423
Are you flogging the puppy again?

04:05.741 --> 04:08.752
Lemme in. I gotta wash
this crap off my face!

04:08.816 --> 04:11.046
Mom, can you wait just a sec, please?

04:11.077 --> 04:15.103
Honey, I have to rot my life
away in a 9-to-5 hellhole

04:15.104 --> 04:19.274
to support your lazy, juvenile
delinquent ass, remember?

04:20.360 --> 04:23.601
Sweetheart, chipmunk,

04:23.602 --> 04:27.768
my little ray of sunshine

04:27.769 --> 04:29.777
open up this motherhumping

04:29.794 --> 04:32.231
door now!

04:34.755 --> 04:37.460
Jesus, can you hold on?

04:41.709 --> 04:43.781
Gripes, it's as soggy
as an armpit in here.

04:43.827 --> 04:46.163
How long've you been in
that shower abusing yourself?

04:46.311 --> 04:48.273
You pump your handle
too much, young man.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.333
It's gonna wither up and fall off!

04:50.976 --> 04:52.936
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!

04:54.763 --> 04:56.931
Bitch.

05:30.993 --> 05:33.399
Mel, I gotta make a
documentary about someone

05:33.400 --> 05:35.596
I care about 'n' it's
due next Wednesday.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.007
And who ever said you
care about me anyways?

05:38.037 --> 05:41.632
Didn't I give you my Cap'n Crunch
Decoder Ring back in the sixth grade?

05:41.818 --> 05:44.560
That was Angelique Tewksbury, dorkball.

05:46.022 --> 05:49.332
Hey, take your shirt off.
Come on.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.330
It'll give Professor Starkweather
a boner 'n' he'll gimme an 'A'.

05:52.377 --> 05:54.576
I'm sure.
Take your Prozac, Dark.

05:54.594 --> 05:56.573
What's the matter?
You scared?

05:56.574 --> 05:58.820
No.
- Think of the scandal.

05:58.821 --> 06:02.443
Everyone in class'll be all outraged.

06:04.147 --> 06:06.485
Is this what you wanna see?

06:06.488 --> 06:08.392
Oh yeah.
Man.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.176
City morgue, you stab 'em, we slab 'em.

06:13.223 --> 06:17.410
S'up, bonzo dog breath? Need
a ride to class? - Nah. I'm not goin'.

06:17.432 --> 06:19.456
Dark, you are gonna
totally bite the eight

06:19.457 --> 06:21.479
whole credits you're
retaking this semester

06:21.480 --> 06:23.735
I gotta do some editing
on my 101 project, then

06:23.736 --> 06:26.037
I'll prob'ly head over
to the Hole for some chow

06:26.364 --> 06:30.645
Maybe I'll go with. I just got my period
so I'm in full-tilt pigout mode.

06:30.773 --> 06:32.701
And make sure you edit my boobs out.

06:32.734 --> 06:36.449
I do not want every wally on
campus oglin' my chimichangas.

06:36.450 --> 06:38.778
Hey, Lucifer's not with you, is she?

06:38.840 --> 06:41.276
I cannot stomach seeing her butt-ugly
likeness this early in the day.

06:41.325 --> 06:43.257
Lick my box, Rover!

06:43.289 --> 06:46.568
Clean the maggots out of it
first, you stinky oyster. - You guys

06:46.627 --> 06:49.275
I mean it, Mel. I do not
want to have to look at that

06:49.276 --> 06:51.286
tarantula woman over my morning espresso

06:51.368 --> 06:54.445
Don't be a seizure queen.
We'll pick you up in fifteen.

06:54.475 --> 06:57.266
Mel, I told you, I'm
editing - Seeya, loverboy.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.359
How you can continue
to frog that annoying

07:00.360 --> 07:01.533
buttloaf when you have someone as

07:01.580 --> 07:03.553
sexy 'nd rad as me around.

07:03.554 --> 07:06.179
What would life be
without a little mystery?

07:06.260 --> 07:08.173
Mel?
- Quoi?

07:08.174 --> 07:12.680
You wenches done in there or what?
I gotta whiz like a busted firehose.

07:16.356 --> 07:20.382
Finale.
- If it isn't widdle baby Zero.

07:20.429 --> 07:22.340
Cut it out.

07:23.183 --> 07:26.499
Bye, gross, huh?

07:28.095 --> 07:31.069
So you uh, hittin'
Jujyfruit's party tonight?

07:31.319 --> 07:34.062
Puh-leeze, Zero.
How did you hear about it?

07:35.536 --> 07:37.797
You are not invited, shrimpskin.

07:37.843 --> 07:39.948
You're barely old enough to shave.

07:40.191 --> 07:42.160
Felch me.

07:42.578 --> 07:45.673
C'mon, I got a date with Zoe
'n' she totally wants to go.

07:46.221 --> 07:49.790
I already scored the
car from Mom. - Life sucks.

07:52.412 --> 07:56.179
I have got the skeeviest zit sproutin'
right in the middle of my forehead.

07:56.227 --> 07:58.404
It's gonna be a full-on
third eye by the

07:58.405 --> 08:00.580
time we get to Jujyfruit's party.
Hate that.

08:00.659 --> 08:02.795
What I hate is when you
get a zit way down on your

08:02.796 --> 08:05.014
back in a spot where you
can't even reach to pop it.

08:05.059 --> 08:09.078
If you pop a zit on your forehead, you
can get blood poisoning and die, y'know.

08:09.109 --> 08:11.140
Lucifer, you are so
dumb, you should donate

08:11.141 --> 08:13.171
your brain to a monkey science fair.

08:13.227 --> 08:16.111
I read it in Mouth 2
Mouth, scrotal fungus.

08:16.192 --> 08:18.168
Mel, what's this?

08:19.026 --> 08:21.555
Dark being born.

08:22.308 --> 08:24.340
Mature.

08:24.557 --> 08:26.652
Yuk yuk yuk.

08:29.685 --> 08:32.044
Whoa, Mel, back it up.
- What?

08:32.046 --> 08:34.037
Just back up, alright?

08:40.611 --> 08:43.291
Need a lift?
- Well

08:43.340 --> 08:45.641
You're in my Modern
Society class, aren't you?

08:45.818 --> 08:48.765
Yeah, I think. - Name's
Dark-thats "Dark" like

08:48.766 --> 08:51.773
absence of light Or "Dork"
like we all call him.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.017
Cram it, furburger.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.958
This is Mel, 'n' the
loudmouth hag is Lucifer.

08:57.064 --> 08:59.012
Montgomery.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.770
We're on our way to the Hole
for breakfast. Wanna join?

09:01.832 --> 09:06.644
I, kinda have a class.
- We'll eat quick 'n' drop you.

09:08.528 --> 09:11.089
C'mon

09:12.103 --> 09:14.237
So what's with the camcorder?
You in film class?

09:14.268 --> 09:17.528
Dark thinks he's gonna be
the next Clive Barker-right.

09:17.763 --> 09:20.378
Eat my turbo, willya Lucifer?

09:20.454 --> 09:22.954
Actually, I'm convinced
I'm gonna die soon

09:22.955 --> 09:25.454
in like a spectacular
plane crash, fire,

09:27.050 --> 09:29.011
chemical explosion
'n' I wanna film it so

09:29.012 --> 09:31.293
there'll be this like cool
record of my own death.

09:31.307 --> 09:33.234
So I take my camera
with me wherever I go

09:33.235 --> 09:36.017
Isn't that just so bitchen

09:36.037 --> 09:38.146
Will you please Shut
- Up?

09:38.912 --> 09:41.182
How do you know?
- Know what?

09:41.183 --> 09:43.718
That you're gonna, y'know die.

09:44.027 --> 09:46.403
I feel it.

09:46.744 --> 09:50.449
Like a prenomination.
- You mean "premonition".

09:52.773 --> 09:55.698
Whatever. - Well, I don't understand,
how can you have one

09:55.699 --> 09:57.599
if you can't even
pronounce the frigging word?

09:57.626 --> 09:59.605
I am about to lose my temper, Lucifer.

09:59.650 --> 10:01.573
And I am going to deck you.
- C'mon.

10:01.574 --> 10:03.474
You guys

10:06.586 --> 10:08.487
Alyssa.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.463
Ooops.

10:11.947 --> 10:13.876
Clumsy me.

10:13.932 --> 10:17.366
Hi Montgomery.
What're you doing here?

10:17.407 --> 10:21.188
Aren't you s'posed to be in
Thermonuclear Catastrophes class?

10:21.412 --> 10:26.263
Yeah, well, uh Hey.

10:29.931 --> 10:32.201
Do you know what today is?

10:32.282 --> 10:35.268
Friday?
- No, dodo-bird.

10:35.315 --> 10:37.504
It's Armageddon Day.

10:37.536 --> 10:40.146
The day the world is supposed to end.

10:40.163 --> 10:42.619
Like have you heard of "The Rapture"?

10:42.649 --> 10:44.858
The Siouxsie and the Banshees album?

10:44.889 --> 10:49.800
No. It's like this radical religious
movement in South Cambodia.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.827
And all these thousands
of people are giving up

10:51.830 --> 10:54.615
their worldly possessions
and leaving their families

10:54.659 --> 10:57.710
All in preparation for
'The Rapture", ascending

10:57.742 --> 11:00.903
into Heaven on the day
that Christ returns to earth

11:00.925 --> 11:03.110
and the world is destroyed.

11:03.220 --> 11:07.438
And according to those
scriptures, today is that day.

11:08.499 --> 11:10.827
So, like, what're we s'posed to do?

11:10.998 --> 11:13.696
I don't know.
- Alyssa.

11:13.698 --> 11:15.551
Are you gonna join us
back here on Planet

11:15.552 --> 11:17.403
Earth sometime this decade or what?

11:19.232 --> 11:21.205
Hi Dingbat.

11:37.124 --> 11:39.170
Are you goin' to the
Kick The Can game tonight?

11:39.202 --> 11:41.113
Duh.
Yes.

11:41.177 --> 11:43.542
C'mon. I am fully
prepared to pork major.

11:43.748 --> 11:45.939
Bye, Montgomery.
- Bye. - Seeya.

11:48.251 --> 11:51.190
I gotta burn these calories
fast before I blow up.

11:51.225 --> 11:53.209
Let's go rollerblading or something?

11:53.210 --> 11:57.031
I'd rather have my ball hairs
burned off with an acetylene torch.

11:57.245 --> 11:59.281
Well, that can be arranged.

12:00.388 --> 12:02.750
I better get back to class.

12:02.842 --> 12:05.419
Are you OK, man?
You look kinda pale.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.320
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:07.762 --> 12:10.616
I gotta go.
- We're on our way out, we'll drive you.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.375
You sure y'don't wanna come with?

12:15.218 --> 12:17.844
I think I'm gonna go to the recordstore.
- How now, brown cow?

12:17.845 --> 12:19.745
Cowboy.

12:22.589 --> 12:25.249
So, I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.602
Hey, you guys playin'
Kick The Can tonight? - Huh?

12:27.603 --> 12:30.450
Kick The Can. At ten o'clock
in the old baseball field.

12:30.451 --> 12:34.147
Before Jujyfruit's party.
- You're gonna be there, right?

12:34.336 --> 12:36.312
Sure.
- Okay.

12:36.347 --> 12:38.345
Let's evacuate, please.

12:38.362 --> 12:40.858
Hey, don't forget our gig at
the Buttcrack next Wednesday.

12:41.047 --> 12:45.745
Who's opening? - Sandy Duncan's Eye and
Jayne Mansfield's Head.

12:45.793 --> 12:48.955
Boge. I met the drummer for Sandy
Duncan's Eye at a party.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.467
Reeks like a barnyard animal.
- So come late then 'n' just see us.

12:55.827 --> 12:57.757
Hey, have you seen Bart around today?

13:01.683 --> 13:04.154
Y'know, we were s'posed to rehearse this

13:04.155 --> 13:06.810
morning 'n' he like
totally flaked again.

13:07.979 --> 13:10.496
Barty boy. Haven't seen
you in a golden age

13:10.530 --> 13:14.474
Yeah I've been busy.
- Busy jonesin', y'mean.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.602
Whatev

13:22.098 --> 13:24.791
C'mon, Handjob, quit screwin' around.

13:28.411 --> 13:33.254
Hey Bart. To whom do we owe
the pleasure? - Hey Kriss, Kozy.

13:34.228 --> 13:37.110
We were hoping you were
here for an appointment.

13:37.111 --> 13:39.316
Actually, me 'n' Handjob're just

13:39.317 --> 13:41.521
conductin' a bit-o-business.
- Oh bummer.

13:42.899 --> 13:46.525
Isn't that a humongous bummer, Kriss?

13:46.720 --> 13:49.836
Bart's here for my brand
of bliss today, ladies.

13:50.209 --> 13:52.414
I dunno what to do.

13:53.343 --> 13:56.091
It's hard enough bein' in a
band with your boyfriend, but

13:56.126 --> 13:58.489
when stuff like this starts happenin'!
Mean, what'm I s'posed to do?

13:58.524 --> 14:00.466
Fire him?

14:02.117 --> 14:04.470
Or break up at least.

14:05.031 --> 14:07.152
OK, ladies

14:13.568 --> 14:15.658
SCARF!

14:23.210 --> 14:25.370
Hey so what's up with my video, man?

14:25.984 --> 14:28.634
I'm still in the
'conceptualizing' stages.

14:28.711 --> 14:31.980
Don't worry, it's gonna
blow your testes off. - Yeah?

14:32.025 --> 14:35.621
You 'n' Bart are like trapped inside
this like gigantic, slimy uterus

14:40.928 --> 14:43.725
Glug.
- Are you gonna?

14:43.797 --> 14:45.959
I promised my mom I'd stop for a week.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.995
You? - I'm just gonna
do a bunch of speed

14:47.996 --> 14:49.980
later 'n' not eat for like three days.

15:54.981 --> 15:57.602
Sorry Sorry.

16:01.140 --> 16:05.049
Isn't that.
- OhmyGod.

16:05.690 --> 16:08.290
Well, I guess I'd
better go hunt for him.

16:08.337 --> 16:11.170
Wait. Can you drop me at Aran's?
I wanna score the new Dead Puppies CD.

16:15.826 --> 16:19.422
I'm sorry the door was unlocked 'n' I.
- Forget about it.

16:20.243 --> 16:23.883
What's your name?
- Egg.

16:23.884 --> 16:27.674
Well, I mean, my real name's Polly,
but my friends all call me Egg.

16:27.719 --> 16:31.198
'EGG'? - It's dweeby, I know,
but it just kinda stuck.

16:31.263 --> 16:33.163
Well, hi Egg.
- I'm...

16:33.164 --> 16:35.686
I know who you are.

16:35.735 --> 16:38.094
I'm not from another dimension.

16:41.350 --> 16:43.678
He looks shorter in person.
- So what?

16:43.679 --> 16:46.523
He's still the total
definition of yummy.

16:46.617 --> 16:48.517
OhmyGod, whatdidhesay?

16:48.610 --> 16:53.593
Nothing really, he just. He invited
me to go for a walk. - WHAT?

16:53.594 --> 16:55.561
Hey, did y'hear what happened to Marcus?

16:55.562 --> 16:58.040
His butthole fell out 'n' he
has to have surgery.

16:58.041 --> 16:59.941
Oh Henry.

17:06.306 --> 17:08.579
Oona-eye.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.665
Are we still in reality?

17:17.742 --> 17:19.644
My palm itches.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.946
Where's your twin brother Shad?

17:28.318 --> 17:30.263
Death:

17:30.316 --> 17:32.676
Cool.

17:35.775 --> 17:38.824
Have I ever told you that I love you?

17:39.293 --> 17:42.395
Stow it'n'pay the lady, Shad.

17:45.033 --> 17:48.680
Watch out, breeders! - Watch out
yourself, you freakin' lezbots!

17:48.822 --> 17:51.482
Eat my Bermuda Triangle, Shad!

17:57.061 --> 17:59.326
RACE!

18:08.115 --> 18:10.070
You alright?

18:11.315 --> 18:13.274
Kill.

18:16.484 --> 18:18.869
Hey, look who it is

18:20.696 --> 18:23.762
Hey Jana, isn't that your
muff diving little sister over

18:23.763 --> 18:26.663
there with her disgusting
Bosco-flavored girlfriend?

18:26.801 --> 18:30.643
Insert it in your clammy
crevice, will you Shannon?

18:32.035 --> 18:34.385
Hey, I think I need to pump again.

18:35.204 --> 18:37.682
I could use a firm-up too.

18:38.488 --> 18:43.008
Puke-ity.
- Kiss it and make it better.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.544
So what're you gonna wear
to Jujyfruit's party tonight?

18:51.590 --> 18:53.844
Clothes.

18:54.593 --> 18:57.999
Can I borrow your Human
Sexology notes from last Friday?

18:58.051 --> 19:02.167
Am I, like, the only person on this
cosmic plane who ever goes to class?

19:02.983 --> 19:05.468
Hey, do you think
Montgomery likes me?

19:06.137 --> 19:08.109
He's weird.
- Y'think?

19:08.135 --> 19:11.658
Yo, Alyssa!
- Hey Ducky.

19:11.706 --> 19:16.630
Hi, Ducky.
- I just woke up.

19:16.686 --> 19:20.047
Really? - You guys hear
Muriel's in Cedar Sinai?

19:20.110 --> 19:22.077
Who's Muriel?
- My stepmom.

19:22.109 --> 19:24.594
She's like way anorexic: she
passed out in her low-impact

19:24.595 --> 19:27.008
aerobics class 'nd they had to
carry her out on a stretcher.

19:27.179 --> 19:29.113
Oh, drag.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.686
You guys gonna be at the
Kick The Can game later?

19:31.816 --> 19:34.217
I am.

19:40.323 --> 19:43.630
Later, tater-tots.
- Right.

19:45.162 --> 19:47.486
Hi Elvis.

19:48.808 --> 19:53.196
Where've you been?
- Places. Get on.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.564
What does she see in that scuzball?

19:58.707 --> 20:01.917
You smell like a wet dog.

20:02.090 --> 20:07.027
Complainin'?
- Nope, rreeeorrrr.

20:09.073 --> 20:11.935
Y'seen Egg around?
It's her turn to recycle the aluminum.

20:11.996 --> 20:15.512
OhmyGod. You haven't heard? Your little
sister just left here with you're not

20:15.529 --> 20:19.116
even gonna believe this.
Do you ever watch Baywatch?

20:19.151 --> 20:22.704
D'you think this is completely
freaky or what? - What?

20:22.744 --> 20:25.731
Y'know. Hangin' out, with me, like this.

20:25.732 --> 20:28.494
Well it's a little surreal, I guess.

20:30.527 --> 20:33.916
You have no idea how sucky it
is being like, a "celebrity".

20:34.058 --> 20:36.351
Everybody treats you like
you're not even a person

20:36.352 --> 20:38.420
anymore, like you're
this thing, this entity.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.563
You're eating dinner
in some restaurant, or

20:40.564 --> 20:42.987
goin' to the movies or
whatever, and people stare

20:42.988 --> 20:45.120
and point at you, start
whisperin' to their

20:45.121 --> 20:47.495
friends like you're some
exhibit at a freak show

20:47.946 --> 20:52.097
Wow.
- That's why I like being with you.

20:52.174 --> 20:54.352
I mean, I don't know you that well or

20:54.353 --> 20:56.530
anything, but you seem,
I dunno, different.

20:56.725 --> 20:59.935
Neat.
- Thanks.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.463
Do you wanna sit?
- Sure.

21:03.495 --> 21:07.950
OhmyGod. Jujyfruit's party is tonight
and I have no clue who to go with!

21:07.999 --> 21:11.048
What about Jason?
- I'm going with Jason.

21:11.325 --> 21:13.438
Well then, I'll go with Tomas.

21:13.501 --> 21:17.040
I thought you were going with Tomas.
- Tomas has a dinky weenie.

21:17.100 --> 21:20.020
You did Tomas?
- Ewww, I'm sure, gross.

21:20.065 --> 21:21.995
I thought Jason was doing Tomas.

21:22.025 --> 21:24.974
Jason is doing that Valley
sluthole llene Schwarzkopf.

21:25.099 --> 21:28.881
Untrue. Says who? - Ilene.
- And you believe her?

21:28.897 --> 21:31.725
Hello, she lives in Whittier!

21:32.153 --> 21:35.005
If Jason did llene, then
he must've done Richard.

21:35.050 --> 21:37.764
Who's Richard?
- Ilene's other scag.

21:37.779 --> 21:40.437
Like she's totally into
these kinko threeways.

21:40.452 --> 21:42.352
Ilene is a whore.

21:42.393 --> 21:45.327
Is Richard the surfer with the
hairlip that drives a black Jetta?

21:45.358 --> 21:48.700
No, he's got a Lexus.
- I thought he hung himself.

21:48.701 --> 21:52.003
No, he's, like, totally gorgeous.
Plus he's got a Lexus.

21:52.004 --> 21:54.878
Is he gay?
- Who? Jason?

21:54.879 --> 21:58.032
Richard?
- Tomas.

21:58.033 --> 22:00.343
Well, duh.
What do you think, dingleberry?

22:00.344 --> 22:02.316
I swear, Trudi, you can be so...

22:13.365 --> 22:16.877
Yeah, I wanna write and direct

22:16.878 --> 22:21.503
I have to ensure that
the artistic integrity

22:21.603 --> 22:26.004
of this project isn't compromised

22:28.657 --> 22:31.026
first thing Monday.

22:31.937 --> 22:36.532
I ever-so-solemnly
swear. 'K.

22:38.249 --> 22:41.972
Ciao, J. F. Christ.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.140
Hold on.

22:50.455 --> 22:52.418
Coming.

22:57.937 --> 23:01.191
Where is he?
Where is he?

23:01.316 --> 23:04.848
He was here tike an hour or so ago

23:04.849 --> 23:09.173
but no, man, he's not here now.

23:09.698 --> 23:14.232
See Barty boy has left the building.
- Where'd he go man?

23:14.294 --> 23:16.702
Did he say where he was going?
- Heaven.

23:16.767 --> 23:19.607
He said he was taking a hike up

23:19.608 --> 23:22.172
that or Stairway To Heaven.

23:24.969 --> 23:27.368
Bye.

23:27.974 --> 23:31.745
My hat.
Where's my hat.

23:31.811 --> 23:36.752
So, are you in school?
Studying?

23:36.786 --> 23:39.135
I dunno. Nothing.

23:39.508 --> 23:43.992
Well I mean, a bunch of
stuff, nothing specific

23:44.008 --> 23:45.998
Well, just as long as you
aren't in the Industry.

23:46.029 --> 23:48.988
I have sworn off all actresses,
models, d-girls, you-name-it.

23:49.069 --> 23:52.294
Forever.
I have this fantasy.

23:53.088 --> 23:56.567
It's probably cornball
or romantic, I know but

23:56.568 --> 23:59.971
there's times when I
want to just disappear.

24:00.036 --> 24:03.549
Meet up with someone special, and just
run away, never be heard from again.

24:03.599 --> 24:05.512
Don't you think that'd be killer?

24:08.153 --> 24:10.279
Me too.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.901
I figured you'd be here.

24:23.859 --> 24:27.935
Hey Dude. - Bart.
You promised me, man.

24:28.596 --> 24:32.417
I'm sorry, Cowboy.
I'm really sorry.

24:32.450 --> 24:34.885
You have got to get clean, man.

24:35.364 --> 24:37.585
You've got to.
Or it's all over.

24:37.617 --> 24:39.565
Okay?
You, me,

24:39.592 --> 24:41.809
the band, the whole falafel.

24:42.341 --> 24:44.769
I will, Cowboy.
You know I will.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.756
I mean it this time, Bart.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.371
C'mere,

24:53.349 --> 24:55.723
come up here.

25:01.872 --> 25:06.378
No, man.
Just get clean.

25:06.968 --> 25:09.059
Look, I'll do anything to help you

25:09.060 --> 25:11.198
through it but we
cannot do this anymore.

25:11.310 --> 25:15.649
You get it?
No more.

25:20.622 --> 25:23.301
I love you, dude.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.039
Thirsty?

25:39.185 --> 25:41.139
Dyin'.

25:42.626 --> 25:45.297
So howyadoin', smiley?

25:48.384 --> 25:51.683
OK now.

25:59.446 --> 26:02.673
Mel. Dark.

26:04.890 --> 26:07.362
I love you, Mel.

26:07.473 --> 26:12.442
Totally true and pure Mutual.

26:13.278 --> 26:17.869
1 just wish we didn't like get together
with so many other people 'n' stuff

26:19.398 --> 26:22.344
Palooka, you know

26:24.196 --> 26:26.565
that I firmly believe

26:28.000 --> 26:30.255
that human beings are built

26:31.113 --> 26:33.362
for sex and for love.

26:34.916 --> 26:36.846
And that we should
dole out as much of both

26:36.879 --> 26:38.839
as possible before
we're old and ugly and

26:38.884 --> 26:41.020
nobody wants to touch us anymore.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.752
I know

26:44.831 --> 26:48.188
And just because I make it

26:49.535 --> 26:51.747
with other guys and girls

26:53.811 --> 26:56.736
has no effect whatsoever
on my feelings for you.

26:57.408 --> 27:00.661
Sometimes I feel so old-fashioned
and from another planet.

27:00.710 --> 27:03.586
It's like I'm half a person
without you.

27:04.987 --> 27:07.670
You are so cute.

27:19.788 --> 27:21.985
Life is so complicated.

27:22.032 --> 27:24.010
I wrote a poem for you last night.

27:24.056 --> 27:28.180
Want me to read it to you?
- No.

27:30.306 --> 27:33.429
Hey Elvis Do you believe in God?

27:37.742 --> 27:39.680
I don't believe in anything.

27:44.402 --> 27:46.963
You have to believe in something.

27:47.783 --> 27:49.725
No I don't.

27:52.256 --> 27:54.711
Tie me up.

27:56.215 --> 27:58.968
OK, Mr. Kinky.

28:05.820 --> 28:09.230
This OK?
- Tighter. Tighter!

28:11.159 --> 28:14.358
Now the pants baby, the pants.

28:23.865 --> 28:25.935
Okay now, spank me, baby.

28:25.989 --> 28:30.174
Spank my hot, tight, rock-hard ass!

28:31.531 --> 28:36.504
Harder! Harder! HARDER!

28:38.578 --> 28:40.916
Uh, Elvis?

28:41.275 --> 28:45.364
I love you.

28:46.781 --> 28:49.801
Ditto, hugbunny.

28:55.162 --> 29:00.093
I love you, Lilith I love you
more than life, more than death,

29:00.094 --> 29:04.397
more than time more than
space I love you, I love you.

29:05.508 --> 29:09.638
I bet you say that to all the girls.

29:12.109 --> 29:14.212
Mommy.

29:14.260 --> 29:17.877
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

29:27.655 --> 29:30.600
In this world of
depravity and perversion,

29:30.601 --> 29:33.476
who is the Only One
that can lead you out

29:33.522 --> 29:36.902
of the muck, out of
the dank, filthy swamp

29:36.903 --> 29:40.361
that mankind has
foolheartedly sunken into?

29:42.162 --> 29:44.185
JESUS!

29:44.907 --> 29:48.479
Jesus! Jesus who died
on the Cross for our sins.

29:48.557 --> 29:51.746
Welcome Jesus Into Your
Lives, Brothers and Sisters,

29:51.747 --> 29:55.477
So That He Can Show You The Way
Into The True Kingdom of God!

29:55.569 --> 29:58.301
I read someplace that that
dude's got like twelve wives.

29:59.948 --> 30:03.441
I think I'm drunk.
- Most excellent.

30:07.665 --> 30:10.503
To Destiny.

30:15.992 --> 30:20.618
Hey.
- What?

30:28.824 --> 30:31.201
You are so beautiful

30:49.811 --> 30:52.271
wait stop.

30:55.755 --> 30:57.444
Don't play little innocent
virgin with me, babe.

30:57.445 --> 30:59.133
You want me. Admit it.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.264
You wanna make it with me
so you can go back to say,

31:01.326 --> 31:03.788
"Hey, I just screwed a big
star, aren't I just So Bitchen?

31:10.635 --> 31:14.501
No please. Don't please, stop no.

31:15.314 --> 31:17.305
What're you gonna do?

31:22.381 --> 31:25.974
Sir? Excuse me, sir?
Is everything alright?

31:26.041 --> 31:29.376
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just knocked over a chair by accident.

31:30.047 --> 31:31.984
Sorry to bother you, sir.

31:32.016 --> 31:34.846
Have a good evening.
- Thanks.

31:35.856 --> 31:37.916
Well, that was a close
call, now wasn't it?

31:37.948 --> 31:39.916
But tonight, tonight
is your lucky night,

31:39.917 --> 31:42.072
little Egg, because
you're gonna get the best

31:42.073 --> 31:44.182
dogging of your perky,
pathetic little life,

31:44.183 --> 31:46.478
and you're gonna love
every single second of it.

31:46.587 --> 31:49.378
You'll feel like you've just
died and went straight to Heaven

32:30.744 --> 32:34.450
Dear, sweet and tender Bart.

32:36.714 --> 32:41.426
How do you spell Relief?

32:53.376 --> 32:57.771
Isn't sex just the best
tension release there is?

32:59.239 --> 33:01.905
It's like a really good, sweaty game of

33:01.970 --> 33:06.312
racquetball
- Only you get to come at the end.

33:09.467 --> 33:12.354
I adore you.

33:12.666 --> 33:15.913
What a nice thing to say.

33:17.627 --> 33:20.087
Why don't we just
bout the Kick The Can

33:20.088 --> 33:22.546
Game 'n' hideaway here
in my room forever?

33:22.758 --> 33:24.946
What time is it?

33:25.536 --> 33:27.483
No way.

33:27.677 --> 33:30.449
I was s'posed to pick up
Lucifer twenty minutes ago.

33:30.648 --> 33:34.814
Mel
- She is totally gonna roast my rump.

33:35.125 --> 33:37.832
Mel
- Angelboy, I gotta go.

33:38.086 --> 33:39.997
Mel, waitasecond.

33:42.428 --> 33:44.974
Will you marry me?

33:46.671 --> 33:51.322
You are too precious for words.

33:53.749 --> 33:56.929
Okay, I'll see you at Kick The Can.

33:57.121 --> 34:01.125
'N' don't forget it's
your turn to provide the X.

34:05.902 --> 34:07.932
Love you, pooh butter.

34:08.168 --> 34:10.197
Bye.

34:33.039 --> 34:35.646
Zero?
- Yeah, Zoe, it's me.

34:35.678 --> 34:37.637
Be right down.

34:45.364 --> 34:48.190
Hey homey.
Why so jumpy?

34:48.824 --> 34:53.193
I just. Nothing.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.720
Strawberry.

35:03.538 --> 35:05.458
I missed you.

35:05.524 --> 35:08.229
You just saw me the day
before yesterday, kumquat.

35:08.262 --> 35:10.295
So?
I missed you anyway.

35:10.327 --> 35:12.679
Y'mean "Gilligan" here missed me.

35:13.025 --> 35:14.972
We both did.

35:15.005 --> 35:18.691
You're our favorite person in
this whole, wide, scuzbucket world

35:19.888 --> 35:23.113
You are the sweetest boy ever.

35:29.970 --> 35:33.261
So did you get the address
to Jujyfruit's Party?

35:34.185 --> 35:38.563
Zero.
- Hey Would I ever let you down?

35:43.335 --> 35:46.764
Hi honey.
How was school today?

35:48.988 --> 35:50.969
Great.

35:51.372 --> 35:54.870
Don't forget, the Father-Son Bowling
Championship is next Saturday.

35:56.411 --> 36:00.059
I won't forget.
- Hungry?

36:00.085 --> 36:03.409
There's leftover taquitos in the fridge.

36:04.983 --> 36:07.404
Thank you.

36:29.957 --> 36:33.076
Miracle AIDS cure
turns out to be a hoax.

36:33.123 --> 36:36.744
The Atari Gang continue their
reign of terror in the city.

36:36.802 --> 36:41.450
And Palos Verdes City Councilwoman
Andrea Sperling insists her teenage

36:41.514 --> 36:46.304
son was kidnapped and
experimented on by Space Aliens.

36:46.305 --> 36:49.202
And now a word from our sponsor.

37:13.562 --> 37:15.592
Tough tits, dickweed.

37:15.622 --> 37:18.363
You're It.

37:24.847 --> 37:26.965
Tabithatime.

38:16.352 --> 38:18.492
1, 2, 3

38:18.493 --> 38:22.058
4, 5, 6,

38:22.091 --> 38:25.482
7, 8, 9, 10.

38:25.483 --> 38:29.633
11, 12, 13

38:33.283 --> 38:36.964
17, 18, 19

38:37.010 --> 38:39.117
20.

38:41.064 --> 38:44.798
There it is, babe.
The vast and arid wasteland of

38:44.799 --> 38:47.801
glittering filth, emptiness and death.

38:47.973 --> 38:50.191
Hooray.

38:51.668 --> 38:55.962
Hey, did you hear about that
old guy in Brentwood who croaked

38:56.286 --> 38:59.995
and then by the time
his neighbors found him,

38:59.996 --> 39:02.978
his dog had eaten half his face off?

39:04.542 --> 39:07.482
Dogs eating people is cool.

39:13.506 --> 39:16.819
Let the love feast begin.

39:25.983 --> 39:30.306
Occupied, dude.
- Sorry.

39:30.843 --> 39:33.152
Hey, you guys goin'
to Jujyfruit's Party?

39:33.198 --> 39:35.982
Buzz off, twerp.

39:36.670 --> 39:38.634
Assholes.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.284
Goddamn chipmunks.

39:45.221 --> 39:48.911
Now what?

39:54.784 --> 39:58.207
Not there.

39:58.208 --> 40:00.945
There.

40:25.606 --> 40:28.328
Taste good?

40:49.623 --> 40:52.396
I just love the Milk
Chocolatey Goodness of...

40:53.276 --> 40:56.009
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

41:00.338 --> 41:02.518
What a' goomba.

41:02.553 --> 41:05.479
You see him?
- He's fifty feet from the can

41:05.558 --> 41:09.316
and so blitzkrieged, he's
like staggering around.

41:11.934 --> 41:15.025
Ducky?
- What?

41:15.809 --> 41:18.672
Have you ever like, I know it's none of

41:18.673 --> 41:21.902
my business or anything,
but I kinda heard

41:21.903 --> 41:24.876
this rumor that you're
kinda like waiting

41:24.877 --> 41:27.848
for the right person.
- That is not true.

41:29.161 --> 41:32.870
I've "done it", I'm sure.

41:33.061 --> 41:36.486
With who? - Lotsa people.
A buncha different times.

41:51.905 --> 41:54.546
What'd you do that for?

41:54.896 --> 41:59.067
I think you chipped my tooth.
- C'mon.

42:00.264 --> 42:03.045
FREEEEEEEEEE!

42:15.504 --> 42:18.801
Cripes, don't bust your ballsac.

42:21.370 --> 42:23.821
You scared me.
- Obvious.

42:24.862 --> 42:27.283
Has Dark been through here yet?

42:27.991 --> 42:29.973
No.

42:30.301 --> 42:32.820
Well, Ducky 'n' Dingbat're already free.

42:32.930 --> 42:35.624
Dark is so swacked
he's already doing the Cujo.

42:37.250 --> 42:40.252
Y'know, the "Cujo."

42:42.157 --> 42:44.081
Oh.

42:44.649 --> 42:47.307
Well, later.

42:47.638 --> 42:50.027
Don't let the Boogeyman get you.

42:50.307 --> 42:52.811
Right.

43:04.608 --> 43:08.518
Jesus, Cowboy

43:19.364 --> 43:21.306
Yum.

43:29.169 --> 43:31.357
Your turn.

43:32.518 --> 43:34.503
Yabba-dabba-doo.

43:35.133 --> 43:37.484
Let's go, baby.

43:38.811 --> 43:43.192
Lets
go-go-GO!

43:51.485 --> 43:54.546
I wanna DIE!

43:55.278 --> 43:57.364
LETS ALL DIE!

44:00.870 --> 44:02.823
What is it?

44:03.497 --> 44:06.539
Nothing. I just.

44:09.164 --> 44:13.158
Have you ever wondered what would
happen if the Big Earthquake hit

44:13.250 --> 44:17.066
and all the nuclear power
plants in California blew up?

44:18.819 --> 44:22.208
I mean, what would they do with all the

44:22.209 --> 44:25.598
hundreds of thousands of dead bodies?

44:25.909 --> 44:29.845
Babycakes, just go back to sleep.

44:55.772 --> 44:58.033
Polly, honey?
Everything alright?

44:58.109 --> 45:01.528
I'm fine, Dad.
- Y'want something to eat?

45:01.621 --> 45:03.756
We saved you some shepherd's pie.

45:03.834 --> 45:07.002
No, thanks.
- I'm not very hungry

45:07.035 --> 45:10.303
Y'sure?
We can heat it up in the micro.

45:10.336 --> 45:12.615
Thanks, Dad, really.

45:12.744 --> 45:16.150
I ate already with Alyssa and Dingbat.

45:16.254 --> 45:19.536
Maybe later then.
- OK

45:25.833 --> 45:29.885
Are you lost, my little lambs?
Confused?

45:29.948 --> 45:33.440
Don't know where in this world to turn?

45:36.595 --> 45:38.603
Back in a flash.

45:52.942 --> 45:54.946
Damn.

45:57.845 --> 46:02.028
Godzilla?
You there, man? Pick up.

46:02.058 --> 46:06.173
C'mon, Hey, you gotta help me out, man.

46:06.237 --> 46:10.725
I need the address for that party
tonight at that Jujyfruit dude's place

46:10.834 --> 46:13.650
So when you get this message, leave the

46:13.651 --> 46:16.611
address on my machine 'n' I'll beep in.

46:16.718 --> 46:19.081
Thanks, Holmes.

46:19.116 --> 46:21.144
Once we get there, I'm
gonna rip Jujyfruit's

46:21.145 --> 46:23.171
balls off 'n' wear 'em
as beef earrings.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.112
Yeah, well, they're not gonna go
with those shoes, you low rent whore.

46:26.236 --> 46:29.254
Hey, where's the crystal,
who's got the crystal?

46:29.345 --> 46:31.895
Well?
Did you get the address?

46:31.938 --> 46:34.119
You are a drug pig.

46:34.162 --> 46:36.140
I'm rubber, you're glue

46:36.188 --> 46:38.158
Didn't I tell you?
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, babe.

46:38.159 --> 46:40.059
You're the Best!

46:40.859 --> 46:43.005
Montgomery?

46:43.084 --> 46:45.081
Mel?

46:45.082 --> 46:47.949
Butthead hogbitch Lucifer?

46:52.065 --> 46:56.055
Anybody here?

47:25.124 --> 47:30.124
Montgomery. Dude

47:49.568 --> 47:52.295
FREEEEEEEEE!

47:53.136 --> 47:58.072
My fellow children of God, will you do
me this one teeny li'l ol* favor? - Yes!

47:58.785 --> 48:02.685
Wherever you are, put down whatever
it is you're doin' And Close Your Eyes.

48:02.744 --> 48:05.221
C'mon, do it with me now.
Don't be shy.

48:05.380 --> 48:08.557
Nobody's watchin'. Close
your eyes, shut'em tight.

48:10.412 --> 48:13.721
Now, along with me, think about Heaven.

48:14.101 --> 48:16.093
Concentrate.

48:16.369 --> 48:20.240
Get a full-color, widescreen
picture in your mind.

48:21.391 --> 48:23.553
Ain't it nice?

48:23.951 --> 48:27.473
Ain't it so
downright beau-ti-ful?

48:27.752 --> 48:31.067
Just feel it. Feel that White, Pure,

48:31.068 --> 48:34.934
Holy Light cascadin' through your veins,

48:34.935 --> 48:38.089
coursin' through your Body And Soul.

48:39.177 --> 48:42.220
Praise Sweet Jesus! Whooaa!

48:44.643 --> 48:47.076
Now doesn't that make
you feel so much better?

48:48.398 --> 48:51.671
Just thinkin' about
Going Straight To Heaven,

48:51.672 --> 48:55.585
Doesn't it make you feel
Soooo Goshdurned Good Inside?

48:57.700 --> 49:01.263
Inner Peace, Harmony,
Eternal Everlasting Salvation.

49:01.455 --> 49:03.658
It is yours, people, All Yours.

49:03.706 --> 49:06.882
And all you have to do is Believe.

49:07.709 --> 49:12.372
Believe! Do you believe,
my fellow children of God?

49:12.433 --> 49:14.341
We believe.
- What's that?

49:14.379 --> 49:16.518
I can't hear you, brothers
and sisters. - We believe.

49:16.553 --> 49:18.544
We believe.

49:18.604 --> 49:20.767
I CANNOT HEAR YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTERS!

49:20.829 --> 49:24.368
We believe.

49:24.680 --> 49:27.101
I CANNOT HEAR YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

49:27.102 --> 49:30.671
It's like I got cottonbalts
stuck in my ears! We believe.

49:31.498 --> 49:34.350
You at home, you gotta me help
out. You gotta let me know,

49:34.351 --> 49:37.922
YOU GOTTA LET JESUS KNOW!
- We believe, we believe

49:37.969 --> 49:42.243

We believe we believe

49:49.906 --> 49:52.661

50:03.525 --> 50:07.219
You are such the driving talent.

50:08.685 --> 50:12.330
Hey, loser.
- Looooooooser.

50:12.624 --> 50:15.712
Where's Montgomery?
Everybody else is free.

50:15.746 --> 50:17.743
We can't wait around for
him all friggin' night.

50:17.774 --> 50:19.109
I saw him in the locker
room a while ago.

50:19.110 --> 50:20.444
Did you check in there?

50:20.492 --> 50:22.450
What's the matter, Dark?

50:22.606 --> 50:24.546
Isn't that his cross?

50:25.126 --> 50:27.429
What, did he get bored
'n* go home or something?

50:27.479 --> 50:30.793
I swear, that guy is
so capital L-A-M-E.

50:30.841 --> 50:32.967
I vote we migrate to the party, okay.

50:32.999 --> 50:34.912
The keg's already extinct I'm sure.

50:34.944 --> 50:37.453
Don'tcha think we oughta wait for him?

50:37.495 --> 50:39.408
I mean, what if...
- He can hook up with us later.

50:39.439 --> 50:41.473
He knows the address.

50:41.613 --> 50:44.976
Besides, I don't know if it's
the 'stacey, but this place

50:44.977 --> 50:47.604
is startin' to give me the
heebies. - I gotta make a call.

50:47.756 --> 50:49.677
I'll catch you guys there.

50:49.715 --> 50:52.804
Bye. - Seeya.
Whatever.

51:00.876 --> 51:02.846
Why're we stopping?

51:02.862 --> 51:06.544
Are we lost, huggybear?
- 'Course not.

51:06.581 --> 51:09.583
I just, I'm figurin'
out the shortcut route

51:09.629 --> 51:12.339
Zero It doesn't matter.

51:12.387 --> 51:15.596
Imean, I really don't care
about that soggy or party.

51:15.642 --> 51:19.495
It probably sucks anyway.
- Zoe, we're gonna find it.

51:19.684 --> 51:23.039
I would never let you down.

51:24.602 --> 51:29.396
You are a dream come true,

51:31.008 --> 51:34.137
OK, out! You heard me, pinhead.

51:34.179 --> 51:37.753
Get outta the car
before I perforate you.

51:41.245 --> 51:43.201
Please. It's my Mom's. She'll kill me.

51:43.281 --> 51:45.689
Well, tell 'er that The Atari say

51:45.690 --> 51:49.169
"thanks for the bitchin wheels, bitch!"

51:50.289 --> 51:53.686
Zero, don't-ZEROHH.

51:57.822 --> 51:59.907
Oh, cuddlepuppy

52:00.433 --> 52:02.889
Hey, Mr. Sighvatssohn.

52:11.565 --> 52:16.374

How could this happen?

52:21.026 --> 52:23.061
Our beloved son.

52:23.174 --> 52:27.420
Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my

52:29.430 --> 52:31.385
What?

52:31.457 --> 52:33.395
I don't know what.

52:36.783 --> 52:38.922
Mr. Sighvatssohn?

52:39.968 --> 52:42.156
Gimme that!

52:42.213 --> 52:46.050
I'm full of hate. I want to kill.
I'm full of hate. I want to kill.

52:46.082 --> 52:48.166
CRANK IT UP, BITCH!

52:48.247 --> 52:50.308
CRANK IT UP!

52:50.351 --> 52:52.319
LOUDER!

52:53.271 --> 52:56.004
LOUDER!

53:12.288 --> 53:15.164
Isn't this fun?
- Sure.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.910
Don't worry, smooshkins I love you.

53:21.989 --> 53:25.509
Me too.
Totally.

53:25.713 --> 53:28.707
But my mom is gonna wire a
car battery to my testicles.

53:36.721 --> 53:39.459
Hey tadpoles.
Wanna ride?

53:39.554 --> 53:41.902
Yeah! Where you headin'?

Co-ol!

53:55.093 --> 53:57.026
Ready?

53:57.436 --> 54:00.525
Assume the position.

54:01.163 --> 54:03.266
OhmyGod, have you seen Theresa lately?

54:03.297 --> 54:05.447
She gained like fifty
pounds in one week!

54:05.493 --> 54:07.977
I warned her not to stop doing crystal.

54:16.166 --> 54:20.071
Cool.
- Blood is cool.

54:20.203 --> 54:23.599
No honey, your tongue is cool.

54:26.463 --> 54:31.010
Sick! Glory Hallelujah, I am so polluted

54:32.482 --> 54:34.469
Awesome!

54:41.557 --> 54:43.457

55:23.267 --> 55:26.628
Mel, we gotta talk.
- Yeah?

55:27.461 --> 55:29.956
I think we need to
discuss our relationship.

55:30.059 --> 55:32.238
What relationship?

55:32.733 --> 55:36.071
Dark, Baby look, I don't think

55:36.072 --> 55:39.632
this is the time or the place.

55:41.905 --> 55:43.917
Mel!

55:43.979 --> 55:47.515
Surf. Ski. 'sup?
- Sameole, sameole.

55:47.546 --> 55:49.490
Hey Dirk.

55:49.522 --> 55:51.775
We haven't seen you
since that time backstage

55:51.862 --> 55:55.610
at the Palace after the
Engorged Gonads show.

56:11.876 --> 56:14.719
You Tarzan, Me Jane.

56:16.906 --> 56:18.954
Super-sonic!

56:19.446 --> 56:22.696
Isn't that your twin brother?

56:27.144 --> 56:29.571
What?
Oh, hi sis.

56:29.602 --> 56:32.911
Dad said for me to remind
you to mow the lawn tomorrow.

56:32.941 --> 56:36.194
Well, you can tell Dad to
kiss my grinnin* grunt lizard.

56:37.999 --> 56:40.585
No wonder I feel so
randy all of a sudden.

56:40.646 --> 56:42.590
C'mere.

56:50.729 --> 56:52.805
Hey.
D'you know Alonzo DeLosa?

56:52.851 --> 56:54.777
That dude never shuts up.

56:54.778 --> 56:56.803
Well, he shagged this chick he
met at Jones a couple weeks ago,

56:56.804 --> 56:59.213
and last Wednesday, he
woke up 'n' his pecker

56:59.253 --> 57:02.121
was covered in itchy,
black, pus-oozing sores.

57:03.530 --> 57:05.850
'Bout time.
- Bend over, robot.

57:05.851 --> 57:08.650
Where's Mel?
- Hey you guys, Bob's here.

57:08.651 --> 57:12.105
Who's Bob? - That hermaphrodite
pornstar who can screw himself.

57:12.308 --> 57:14.281
What's a hermafrodyke?

57:14.282 --> 57:18.069
Ducky, man. Phone call.
It's your parental unit.

57:19.213 --> 57:22.061
Hello?
HELLO?

57:22.528 --> 57:25.793
Hey, cutie.
Can I jizz on your face?

57:41.297 --> 57:45.417
Wait a second, Dad I can't hear you

57:53.302 --> 57:55.517
Hey, where's Lucifer goin'?

57:59.033 --> 58:02.120
I gotta leak major.

58:03.028 --> 58:05.837
Okay.

58:31.212 --> 58:33.268
Ooopsie.

58:34.185 --> 58:36.085

58:36.187 --> 58:38.087
Hi

58:40.505 --> 58:43.569
Your thing is out.

58:43.666 --> 58:45.810
Huh?
Oh.

58:45.811 --> 58:47.711

58:48.119 --> 58:50.019
Are you done?

58:50.353 --> 58:53.721

58:54.244 --> 58:56.788

58:57.131 --> 59:02.131
Guess I'll have to use
the other John, 'scuze me.

59:05.450 --> 59:08.035
So're you gonna get with
Surf 'n' Ski tonight?

59:08.519 --> 59:11.322
I s'pose.

59:11.980 --> 59:14.825
Mel, are we still together, or what?

59:15.201 --> 59:17.173
Dark

59:17.174 --> 59:21.180
I just wish things weren't so
messed up 'n' confusing, that's all

59:26.912 --> 59:29.305
Can't we just leave this place?

59:29.651 --> 59:31.646
Can't we just leave this
whole planet behind and

59:31.647 --> 59:35.736
forget about everybody 'n' everything
and just like be in love 'n' stuff?

59:35.801 --> 59:37.986
Oh Dark

59:38.751 --> 59:42.400
Hello?
Put the drugs away and open up!

59:42.401 --> 59:47.401
Dark, I Look, can't we
just deal with this later?

59:50.117 --> 59:52.017
Okay?

59:52.357 --> 59:54.719
Okay?

59:57.646 --> 01:00:00.651
I just really miss you, that's all.

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:05.500
Hello? L.A.P.D.
- Can you hold on a minute?

01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:10.729
I gotta go pee.

01:00:15.823 --> 01:00:20.043
Hey sis.

01:00:20.086 --> 01:00:23.269
Hangin.

01:00:25.212 --> 01:00:27.216
Hey, Dark.
How's tricks?

01:00:27.281 --> 01:00:30.836
Hey Zero.

01:00:33.265 --> 01:00:37.200
Yeah, sure.
- Dad, slowdown, I.

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:41.232
Son I don't know how to

01:00:41.544 --> 01:00:43.566
Dad?

01:00:53.528 --> 01:00:57.275

01:00:58.258 --> 01:01:01.059
What is what's wrong Dad

01:01:29.391 --> 01:01:31.316
Hey Dark, have you seen Ducky?

01:01:31.377 --> 01:01:33.364
He disappeared.

01:01:33.502 --> 01:01:36.143
No.

01:01:38.322 --> 01:01:41.642
I think I'm gonna bail.
- How come?

01:01:42.821 --> 01:01:46.872
'Cuz this party's about as
fun as an ingrown butt hair.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.844
NOOOOOOOOOOO.

01:01:52.799 --> 01:01:55.040

01:02:15.575 --> 01:02:18.080
Grab his arm.

01:02:26.315 --> 01:02:29.472
One one-thousand, two

01:02:30.128 --> 01:02:33.606

01:02:34.153 --> 01:02:36.357
Get me a towel.

01:02:39.426 --> 01:02:41.605
EGG EGG

01:03:07.329 --> 01:03:10.628
How would you like to sit on my

01:03:10.629 --> 01:03:14.139
face 'n' cut a big, juicy fart?

01:03:20.214 --> 01:03:22.759
Yo! Dark.

01:03:25.884 --> 01:03:27.870
What's happenin', Handjob?

01:03:28.149 --> 01:03:30.607
No poontang, that's for sure.

01:03:33.332 --> 01:03:35.587
Pardon my french.

01:03:35.648 --> 01:03:38.243
Hey, need anything?

01:03:38.289 --> 01:03:40.945
Up, down, all around

01:03:41.356 --> 01:03:44.679
Nah.
I'm blowin'.

01:03:45.037 --> 01:03:48.752
It's been a gnarly day.
- Yeah?

01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:51.763
In the last eighteen
hours, I've seen four

01:03:51.764 --> 01:03:54.388
people get abducted by a space alien,

01:03:54.389 --> 01:03:56.806
watched Ducky try to drown himself,

01:03:56.807 --> 01:04:00.950
plus I spent like 387 bucks
on CDs at Aran's. - Kick my mom.

01:04:01.647 --> 01:04:04.091
Hey, what CD's'd you score?

01:04:04.277 --> 01:04:06.785
Hey, punk. Remember me?
The one you sold the bad drugs to?

01:04:06.832 --> 01:04:08.784
The one you ripped off?
- Elvis, baby, c'mon.

01:04:08.869 --> 01:04:10.802
Where's my money.
Huh, punk?

01:04:10.989 --> 01:04:13.354
I, got some stuff in the car
killer stuff it's yours gratis.

01:04:13.355 --> 01:04:15.718
- Elvis, DON'T!

01:04:19.913 --> 01:04:22.257
Elvis, STOP IT!

01:04:26.149 --> 01:04:28.115
C'mon! C'MON ASSHOLE! C'mon.

01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:30.799
Come and get me.
Come on big man!

01:04:48.681 --> 01:04:53.027
Oh my God Elvis, STOP IT!

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.721
Dear Diary What a day.

01:05:31.039 --> 01:05:33.329
I swear I have never
been so depressed and

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:35.618
miserable and lonely
in my entire life.

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:39.949
It's like I know there's got to
be somebody out there somewhere,

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:45.455
just one person in this huge,
horrible, unhappy universe

01:05:45.924 --> 01:05:50.132
who can hold me in their arms 'n'
tell me everything's gonna be OK.

01:05:52.378 --> 01:05:56.800
But how long do I have to wait
before that person shows up?

01:05:58.341 --> 01:06:02.345
I feel like I'm sinking deeper
and deeper into quicksand,

01:06:02.346 --> 01:06:06.279
watching everyone around me
die a slow, agonizing death.

01:06:07.807 --> 01:06:12.573
It's like we all know,
way down in our souls,

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:17.960
that our generation is gonna
witness the End Of Everything.

01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:24.515
You can see it in our eyes.

01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:28.340
It's in mine.
Look.

01:06:29.134 --> 01:06:31.074
I'm doomed.

01:06:33.748 --> 01:06:37.233
I'm only eighteen years old
and I'm totally doomed.

01:07:59.114 --> 01:08:01.604
Wait.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:12.750
Jesus!

01:08:23.694 --> 01:08:26.515
Montgomery.

01:08:29.328 --> 01:08:32.970
The weirdest thing just happened to me.

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:39.147
Well, are y'gonna just stand
there with your mouth hangin' open,

01:08:39.662 --> 01:08:42.135
or are you gonna let me in?

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:45.131
Sorry.

01:08:51.706 --> 01:08:53.624
Thanks.

01:09:00.997 --> 01:09:03.438
So, like, what happened?

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:13.478
I got kidnapped by space aliens.

01:09:13.511 --> 01:09:16.026
Really?

01:09:17.228 --> 01:09:19.303
'N' then what?

01:09:19.434 --> 01:09:22.809
Well, they did all these tests
'n' experiments 'n' stuff on me,

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:26.907
then I overheard them talking about
their plan to take over the earth.

01:09:28.868 --> 01:09:30.928
Then I escaped.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:34.542
No way.
- Way.

01:09:34.591 --> 01:09:37.241
FookinA.

01:09:38.484 --> 01:09:40.403
I feel strange.

01:09:40.684 --> 01:09:42.071
I think I'm catchin'
a cold or something.

01:09:42.072 --> 01:09:43.457
- D'you wanna, um?

01:09:43.473 --> 01:09:46.991
Is it OK if I just, uh,
rest here for awhile?

01:09:47.024 --> 01:09:51.050
I'm suddenly like soooooo tired.
- Sure.

01:09:56.594 --> 01:10:00.224
Well, aren't you?
Gonna?

01:10:01.045 --> 01:10:02.982
Yeah

01:10:13.615 --> 01:10:17.133
I, hope you don't take
this the wrong way.

01:10:18.183 --> 01:10:21.015
I mean, I know you and

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:24.104
Mel are like, whatever.

01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:27.638
"Whatever" is right.

01:10:27.667 --> 01:10:31.474
She's all, you know.

01:10:35.079 --> 01:10:38.947
It's not like I'm gay or anything

01:10:40.471 --> 01:10:44.195
and I know we kinda just met.

01:10:45.786 --> 01:10:49.013
But I really like you a lot.

01:10:52.163 --> 01:10:54.815
And I think about you.

01:10:55.701 --> 01:10:58.511
Me too.

01:10:58.831 --> 01:11:03.429
I mean, I feel the same about you

01:11:03.761 --> 01:11:07.242
Like when I was trapped in the pod thing
that the Aliens held me captive in,

01:11:07.508 --> 01:11:11.000
all I could think about
was what if they kill me,

01:11:13.649 --> 01:11:17.239
and I never get to see you again?

01:11:17.577 --> 01:11:20.880
This sounds retarded
and pathetic I know,

01:11:23.641 --> 01:11:26.903
but all my life I've been searching

01:11:26.904 --> 01:11:30.537
for one special person on this awful,

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:34.389
scary planet who I can love,

01:11:35.362 --> 01:11:39.718
who loves me for what I am.

01:11:41.878 --> 01:11:45.099
That is so poetic.

01:11:57.197 --> 01:12:00.165
Is it OK if I spend the night?

01:12:00.856 --> 01:12:04.189
I really wanna sleep next to you.

01:12:07.392 --> 01:12:10.275
Only if you promise

01:12:10.772 --> 01:12:13.555
to never, ever leave me.

01:12:15.182 --> 01:12:17.801
Deal.

01:12:50.696 --> 01:12:53.272
What's is something the matter?

01:12:53.319 --> 01:12:55.509
Montgomery.

01:12:55.549 --> 01:12:58.362
Montgomery, what is it?

01:13:02.074 --> 01:13:05.651
Montgomery, Montgomery,
Montgomery. Tell me what it is.

01:13:05.837 --> 01:13:07.790
Please!

01:13:07.815 --> 01:13:11.148
MONTGOMERY-MONTGOMERY

01:13:12.312 --> 01:13:14.400
Ohmygod, stop

01:13:15.396 --> 01:13:17.543
MONTGOMERY

01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:33.013
I'm outta here.
