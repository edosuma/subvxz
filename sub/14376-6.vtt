00:45.133 --> 00:48.150
Dexter:
The horror...

00:48.183 --> 00:53.000
Of the landmarks in the home
of my parents.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.316
My memory will forever rest

00:54.350 --> 01:01.316
in the room that belongs
to my sister Dee Dee.

01:04.050 --> 01:07.316
I looked with large eyes
to my future.

01:07.350 --> 01:13.050
My invention was no longer
a lazy bird with folded wings.

01:13.083 --> 01:17.233
Sliced bread was possible.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.483
I baked the bread...

01:21.250 --> 01:22.166
[Ding]

01:22.200 --> 01:26.466
And now the moment of truth
is here.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.183
My bread slicer!

01:30.216 --> 01:31.216
But wait, wait!

01:31.250 --> 01:32.400
It was just here!

01:32.433 --> 01:34.133
How could it be?

01:34.166 --> 01:35.350
I just had it.

01:35.383 --> 01:38.050
I could hardly perceive
its capture.

01:38.083 --> 01:41.166
Thoughts of sandwich meat
flitted by me.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.366
No, no! Don't!
Come back!

01:43.400 --> 01:44.416
Toast ran free.

01:44.450 --> 01:49.000
No! Please!
Don't be like this!

01:49.283 --> 01:51.166
Its whereabouts
was a mystery.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.283
I was haunted
by hours of suspense,

01:54.316 --> 01:59.250
only to realize the obvious--

01:59.283 --> 02:01.283
Dee Dee.

02:02.300 --> 02:05.316
Instead of proceeding at once
to her room,

02:05.350 --> 02:10.216
I made an excursion
back to the lab.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.200
Recalling my slicer
from her chambers

02:19.233 --> 02:20.450
would be no simple task,

02:20.483 --> 02:23.183
for her room to me
was more frightening

02:23.216 --> 02:27.233
than the deepest bush
of Africa.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.050
You see, for years
I have had immense fear

02:43.083 --> 02:46.116
of the female germ...

02:46.150 --> 02:47.466
The cootie.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.300
I knew it would be flogging
the current of sweetness,

02:52.333 --> 02:56.116
so I took precautions.

03:18.450 --> 03:20.316
It was a benevolent society

03:20.350 --> 03:25.450
with no structure
or foundation.

03:27.150 --> 03:31.183
I did not share
their flattering humor.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.066
I thought
they might be daughters

03:39.100 --> 03:41.283
of generations
of Molly mobby dolls,

03:41.316 --> 03:42.283
and by their movements,

03:42.316 --> 03:46.450
I saw they were preparing
to strike a blow.

03:51.383 --> 03:56.216
One of the creatures
began to approach me.

04:00.466 --> 04:04.033
Its fierce muscular structure
reminded me

04:04.066 --> 04:08.400
of the anatomy charts I drew up
with Dr. Gray.

04:09.283 --> 04:13.133
Though I did not know what crime
I had committed,

04:13.166 --> 04:17.483
I knew it wanted to beat me.

04:30.200 --> 04:37.233
For 3 days, I took cover under
a wicker wastebasket.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.183
It was quiet.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.333
I listened to the wind outside.

04:46.366 --> 04:50.183
Strangely, I felt proud
of the marks

04:50.216 --> 04:52.483
I had left in the shag rug.

04:53.016 --> 04:57.283
I believed they were the first
footprints made by a boy

04:57.316 --> 04:59.416
in Dee Dee's room.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.116
The hope chest!

05:05.150 --> 05:08.300
It most certainly contained
my treasured slicer.

05:08.333 --> 05:12.150
If I could breeze through
the narrows without mishap,

05:12.183 --> 05:16.150
I might be able to get closer
to the hope chest.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.350
I flew fast

05:17.383 --> 05:21.250
but only to be reminded of that
which I feared from the start--

05:21.283 --> 05:23.033
the cooties.

05:23.066 --> 05:27.016
I took much satisfaction
in shooting them

05:27.050 --> 05:28.316
as I would a tiger.

05:28.350 --> 05:32.150
After all,
the cooties are the tigers

05:32.183 --> 05:35.383
of a little girl's room.

05:36.266 --> 05:38.450
Aah!

05:38.483 --> 05:41.100
Escape was impossible.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.466
They drew upon me
in a semicircle

05:44.000 --> 05:46.333
but kept outside
of an 8-foot radius,

05:46.366 --> 05:49.483
which in self-defense would have
been the death lock.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.383
By great good fortune,
however,

05:51.416 --> 05:54.483
a band of bubble gum tape
was at my feet,

05:55.016 --> 05:58.433
and by the merest accident--
a flaw in the wind to favor me--

05:58.466 --> 06:03.433
the trap, to stick these
little buggers together...

06:03.466 --> 06:06.250
Worked.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.366
On approaching the hope chest,

06:09.400 --> 06:11.483
my mouth became dry.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.183
[Click]

06:13.216 --> 06:14.266
I opened the lock.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.116
My muscles tightened.

06:19.083 --> 06:22.016
My recovery was realized.

06:22.050 --> 06:26.350
I need no longer endure
the many tortures of this room.

06:26.383 --> 06:28.433
Why am I breathing so hard?

06:28.466 --> 06:32.116
I knew the sound at once.

06:34.233 --> 06:39.133
I ran for hundreds of miles
to get back to the door.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.150
Salvation!

06:51.333 --> 06:52.266
Whew!

06:52.300 --> 06:56.000
My suffering
has come to an end.

06:56.033 --> 06:59.100
Hi, Dexter!

07:03.483 --> 07:06.133
The horror...

07:06.166 --> 07:08.416
The horror...

07:08.450 --> 07:13.066
The horror...

07:18.050 --> 07:19.266
Dexter:
After countless
experiments,

07:19.300 --> 07:21.366
all testing proves negative.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.150
No enhanced abilities,
no physical mutations,

07:25.183 --> 07:27.066
no nothing!

07:27.100 --> 07:29.483
It seems you shall never
become

07:30.016 --> 07:33.183
anything more than a mere
monkey.

07:33.216 --> 07:36.100
Monkey, this is
agent honey q.

07:36.133 --> 07:38.133
Help us.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.383
Reading shows primate
50 meters dead ahead.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.333
Break!

08:16.483 --> 08:17.350
Hi!

08:17.383 --> 08:20.383
Hi. We're looking
for a monkey.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.150
I'm a monkey.

08:22.183 --> 08:23.233
[Imitating monkey]

08:23.266 --> 08:28.083
Ok. Uh, we're looking
for a little girl.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.266
Eep! Eep! Eep! Eep!

08:31.000 --> 08:34.100
That's him.
Get him!

08:39.066 --> 08:41.266
Ok. Beam him up.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.183
Ahh.
My quarry has arrived.

08:55.216 --> 08:56.300
[Eek]

08:56.333 --> 08:58.050
No fear, monkey.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.466
I, huntor, the greatest hunter
in the universe,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.350
am still very much alive.

09:04.383 --> 09:07.200
Your reputation precedes you,
monkey,

09:07.233 --> 09:11.383
as one of this world's
mightiest heroes.

09:11.416 --> 09:13.066
And as for me,

09:13.100 --> 09:15.000
well, look around you.

09:15.033 --> 09:18.216
I surround myself
with the spoils of the hunt.

09:18.250 --> 09:21.466
I've triumphed over the most
fearsome creatures

09:22.000 --> 09:23.100
spawned across the universe.

09:23.133 --> 09:30.016
Though my favorite prey has
always been the mighty hero.

09:30.050 --> 09:33.250
Ha ha ha!

09:33.283 --> 09:35.200
What do you say, monkey?

09:35.233 --> 09:37.433
Shall we cut to the chase?

09:37.466 --> 09:39.266
[Eek eek]

09:39.300 --> 09:41.050
You refuse to be hunted?

09:41.083 --> 09:43.333
Well, that's not
very sportsmanlike,

09:43.366 --> 09:49.200
but you haven't seen
what's behind door number 2.

09:49.233 --> 09:50.300
You'll be my quarry,

09:50.333 --> 09:54.483
or your mates
will pay the price.

10:09.050 --> 10:11.350
[Eek eek]

10:11.383 --> 10:14.050
Give me your best shot.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.416
Ha! This heat-seeking
moisture missile

10:16.450 --> 10:19.366
will extinguish
your heat vision.

10:20.166 --> 10:24.100
My amplifizer can absorb
your Sonic sound attack,

10:24.133 --> 10:28.116
amplify it,
and redirect it.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.083
My force field
is specifically designed

10:31.116 --> 10:34.016
to use the exact
opposite frequency

10:34.050 --> 10:36.116
to your energy field.

10:36.150 --> 10:39.016
Oh, and speaking
of energy fields,

10:39.050 --> 10:42.150
this negative ion blaster
should be perfect

10:42.183 --> 10:44.050
for depolarizing
your energy field,

10:44.083 --> 10:48.000
eating away at the very source
of your powers,

10:48.033 --> 10:50.466
which leaves you
very susceptible

10:51.000 --> 10:53.183
to good old-fashioned lead.

10:53.216 --> 10:56.116
That's it! Run!
Run like a monkey!

10:56.150 --> 10:57.183
Ha ha ha!

10:57.216 --> 10:59.183
The hunt is on.

10:59.216 --> 11:02.416
Go, snorkdro, go!

11:05.116 --> 11:08.366
Ha ha ha!

11:08.400 --> 11:11.250
Keep on running,
monkey!

11:11.283 --> 11:14.200
I can track your power's
energy output

11:14.233 --> 11:18.066
with my monkey emissions sensor.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.016
He's disappeared
from me scanner!

11:26.050 --> 11:28.100
What? What?

12:01.033 --> 12:04.233
[Eek eek]

12:07.333 --> 12:09.483

12:12.166 --> 12:14.150

12:21.300 --> 12:23.333

12:26.433 --> 12:28.116
Ta-da!

12:28.150 --> 12:30.366
Whoa!

12:32.133 --> 12:33.350
[Eek eek]

12:33.383 --> 12:36.233
[Grr]

12:36.350 --> 12:38.416
I'll have your head,
monkey!

12:38.450 --> 12:40.250
You can't escape me!

12:40.283 --> 12:44.150
I'm the greatest hunter
in the universe!

12:54.033 --> 12:57.000
Aah!

13:01.483 --> 13:04.300
Whoa!

13:04.333 --> 13:06.083
Whew!

13:07.316 --> 13:11.233
Aah!

13:13.466 --> 13:15.116
Wait!

13:15.150 --> 13:18.183
I'll just set
this self-destruct mechanism

13:18.216 --> 13:20.083
that will take out
this whole asteroid,

13:20.116 --> 13:24.383
which leaves you with 30 seconds
to save your mates...

13:24.416 --> 13:29.483
And leaves me time
to get to my escape ship.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.316
Oh, no!

14:06.250 --> 14:08.433
And so I end
this fantastic voyage

14:08.466 --> 14:09.483
in the organism's Grand Canyon.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.333
It is hard for any mere mortal
to comprehend

14:13.366 --> 14:19.033
the infinite amount
of empty space--

14:19.066 --> 14:20.100
[crash]

14:20.133 --> 14:22.300
What?
I am under attack!

14:37.233 --> 14:40.083
[Tweet tweet]

15:02.366 --> 15:03.450
At last!

15:03.483 --> 15:09.183
My chocolate-chip cookies
are done!

15:24.000 --> 15:25.466
Stop!

15:27.016 --> 15:29.150
These cookies
are not for you.

15:29.183 --> 15:32.100
These cookies are for
my laboratory rats.

15:32.133 --> 15:36.166
These cookies contain
the wonderful formula x29

15:36.200 --> 15:39.183
and are not meant
for human species,

15:39.216 --> 15:42.150
especially a lower
species of sister

15:42.183 --> 15:44.383
such as yourself.

15:44.416 --> 15:45.450
Thusly, I reiterate,

15:45.483 --> 15:50.083
the chocolate-chip
cookies are only for my rats.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.266
Do you
understand that?

15:52.300 --> 15:55.050
No.

15:55.466 --> 15:58.016
Are you a rat?

15:58.050 --> 15:59.033
No.

15:59.066 --> 16:00.383
Then you cannot
have my cookies,

16:00.416 --> 16:03.266
so get out
of my laboratory!

going to do?
