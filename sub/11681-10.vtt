00:00.416 --> 00:01.550
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.318 --> 00:06.853
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:06.921 --> 00:09.289
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.357 --> 00:11.958
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.026 --> 00:14.327
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.395 --> 00:16.363
Where am I?
Miami.

00:16.430 --> 00:19.599
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.667 --> 00:22.235
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.303 --> 00:23.837
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:23.904 --> 00:25.472
Should we shoot them?

00:25.539 --> 00:28.041
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.109 --> 00:30.443
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.511 --> 00:32.946
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.014 --> 00:35.115
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.182 --> 00:37.617
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.685 --> 00:39.286
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:45.863 --> 00:47.430
<i>When you're preparing</i>

00:47.498 --> 00:49.099
<i>to interrogate</i>
<i>a trained operative,</i>

00:49.166 --> 00:51.668
<i>the most useful information</i>
<i>isn't professional --</i>

00:51.736 --> 00:52.535
<i>it's personal.</i>

00:54.572 --> 00:56.573
<i>You need to get</i>
<i>into the target's head...</i>

00:58.943 --> 01:00.477
<i>...Understand</i>
<i>what makes him tick.</i>

01:01.545 --> 01:06.449
<i>Of course, that's easier</i>
<i>with</i> some <i>people than others.</i>

01:08.319 --> 01:10.120
Hi, Fi.

01:12.790 --> 01:14.324
You hear that,
Michael?

01:14.391 --> 01:16.726
The shooting range
is calling your name.

01:16.794 --> 01:18.561
Love to,
but Vaughn gave me homework.

01:18.629 --> 01:21.264
Today's the day.

01:21.332 --> 01:22.532
Vaughn's
checking Simon out

01:22.600 --> 01:24.300
of whatever hole
they've been keeping him in

01:24.368 --> 01:25.702
so I can have
my face-to-face.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.570
Well, I can't imagine
he'll be too thrilled

01:27.638 --> 01:29.405
to talk to the man
who put him in that hole.

01:29.473 --> 01:31.374
Who knows?
He might surprise us.

01:31.442 --> 01:34.511
As I recall,
Simon is <i>full</i> of surprises --

01:34.578 --> 01:36.379
escaping from prison,
kidnapping you,

01:36.447 --> 01:38.314
trying to blow up
half of South Beach...

01:38.382 --> 01:40.416
Leave it to you
to invite him back to Miami.

01:40.484 --> 01:43.653
He was working
with some pretty bad folks, Fi.

01:43.721 --> 01:46.556
Whatever they're hoping
to decode with Simon's bible,

01:46.624 --> 01:47.824
whatever
they're planning...

01:47.892 --> 01:49.859
Simon's the key
to all of it.

02:11.982 --> 02:13.116
Nice digs, huh, buddy?

02:15.986 --> 02:17.120
Quite a party.

02:17.188 --> 02:18.321
Yeah, well, with Simon,

02:18.389 --> 02:19.856
you can't take
any chances.

02:19.924 --> 02:22.358
Never have fewer than six eyes
and three guns on him.

02:22.426 --> 02:24.260
That's gonna be a problem.
I want him alone.

02:24.328 --> 02:25.562
Vaughn,
if he was gonna talk to you,

02:25.629 --> 02:27.096
he would have done it
by now.

02:27.164 --> 02:28.364
Good luck.

02:28.432 --> 02:29.866
I mean, the only thing
I learned from him

02:29.934 --> 02:31.367
is he has
a remarkable tolerance for pain.

02:31.435 --> 02:32.869
Yeah, well, my approach

02:32.937 --> 02:35.071
doesn't involve
sharp instruments or electrodes.

02:35.139 --> 02:37.674
I don't care if you want to cut out
his kidney with a pocketknife

02:37.741 --> 02:39.309
or give him a gallon
of orange sherbet.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.978
One way or another,
we want some answers.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.689
Michael Westen.

02:52.756 --> 02:56.492
I have been dreaming
about this moment for months.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.061
So have I.

02:58.128 --> 03:00.697
But I wouldn't exactly call
<i>my</i> version dreaming.

03:00.764 --> 03:01.898
Fair enough.

03:05.336 --> 03:08.538
So, how you like being Vaughn's
shiny, new toy?

03:08.606 --> 03:09.806
Where is he,
by the way?

03:12.776 --> 03:15.778
This is just
between you and me.

03:15.846 --> 03:18.181
If this conversation
goes well,

03:18.249 --> 03:20.216
maybe I can help make
your time with them

03:20.284 --> 03:21.317
a little more humane.

03:21.385 --> 03:23.119
"Humane"?

03:24.521 --> 03:26.956
That's one thing that's not
in their bag of tricks, Michael.

03:27.024 --> 03:28.791
So, let's get to it.

03:28.859 --> 03:30.360
What do you want?

03:30.427 --> 03:32.729
I found your bible.

03:32.796 --> 03:33.997
Is that right?

03:34.064 --> 03:35.598
Well...

03:35.666 --> 03:37.834
I hope you found
solace and comfort

03:37.902 --> 03:39.402
in the word of the lord.

03:39.470 --> 03:41.337
Not exactly.

03:41.405 --> 03:43.239
Somebody else was trying to steal it
before <i>I</i> got to it.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.442
I need to find out who.

03:49.613 --> 03:53.016
You know...

03:53.083 --> 03:55.919
I have been stuck in
these shackles

03:55.986 --> 03:57.320
for months now --

03:57.388 --> 04:00.723
given me a lot of time
to think about the bible,

04:00.791 --> 04:02.425
particularly
my favorite verse.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.694
<i>Handcuffs, like anything metal,</i>

04:04.762 --> 04:06.529
<i>are vulnerable</i>
<i>to metal fatigue.</i>

04:06.597 --> 04:08.998
<i>Give someone enough time</i>
<i>to work on them,</i>

04:09.066 --> 04:11.134
<i>and they'll break down</i>
<i>just like anything else.</i>

04:11.201 --> 04:12.502
John 8:32.

04:12.569 --> 04:14.704
"You shall know
the truth,

04:14.772 --> 04:16.906
"and the truth
shall set you...

04:16.974 --> 04:17.807
Free"!

04:23.414 --> 04:25.014
No bugs down here,
Michael.

04:25.082 --> 04:27.116
We got 30 seconds
before the guards get here,

04:27.184 --> 04:28.217
so listen close.

04:28.285 --> 04:30.153
I got a present
for you.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.788
There's a cemetery
at 3rd and Grand.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.623
Go to plot 837.

04:33.691 --> 04:35.124
There are some keepsakes
of mine in there,

04:35.192 --> 04:37.860
including an audio tape
labeled "Berlin 2007."

04:37.928 --> 04:39.228
Simon --
listen!

04:39.296 --> 04:40.596
You got to be careful
digging it up,

04:40.664 --> 04:42.165
but I think you're gonna find it
real interesting.

04:42.232 --> 04:44.233
We'll talk about the bible <i>after</i>
<i>you hear what's on that tape.</i>

04:46.370 --> 04:47.537
Oh, here they come.

04:47.604 --> 04:49.439
Let's make this
look good!

04:49.506 --> 04:51.841
Aah!
I'll kill this son of a bitch!

04:51.909 --> 04:52.909
Let me out of here!

04:57.314 --> 04:59.983
Get him out of here!

05:00.050 --> 05:01.651
You all right?

05:02.820 --> 05:03.886
Did you learn <i>anything?</i>

05:03.954 --> 05:05.221
Yeah.

05:05.289 --> 05:07.857
You should replace
his handcuffs more often.

05:14.538 --> 05:16.672
I have
no sympathy for you, Michael.

05:16.740 --> 05:19.342
You are damn lucky...

05:19.410 --> 05:20.910
Simon didn't cut you
to ribbons.

05:20.978 --> 05:22.378
He wasn't
trying to kill me.

05:22.446 --> 05:25.081
He was just passing me
a <i>message.</i>

05:25.149 --> 05:27.150
He told me to go dig up
an audio tape

05:27.217 --> 05:29.085
he buried
at Grove Memorial Park.

05:29.153 --> 05:30.853
You know, Mike,
maybe you should leave the dead

05:30.921 --> 05:32.121
to their eternal rest.

05:32.189 --> 05:33.756
This is either
a wild-goose chase or a trap.

05:33.824 --> 05:36.292
Oh, Simon basically told me
the thing <i>is</i> booby-trapped.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.127
But I don't think
he would have bothered

05:38.195 --> 05:40.296
if there wasn't something
on that tape worth listening to.

05:40.364 --> 05:42.031
Unless
it's a rare Beatles bootleg,

05:42.099 --> 05:44.534
I don't know why he didn't just
tell you what's on that tape.

05:44.601 --> 05:45.802
Me neither.

05:45.869 --> 05:48.337
But Simon's not talking
until I get ahold of it.

05:48.405 --> 05:49.705
Wait, you're going back
to see him?

05:49.773 --> 05:51.207
I told Vaughn
to keep him around

05:51.275 --> 05:53.509
while I tried to come up
with a new way to crack him.

05:53.577 --> 05:54.877
You are a glutton
for punishment.

05:54.945 --> 05:57.914
Actually, I can't go after
the tape by myself.

05:57.981 --> 06:00.950
Vaughn is playing nice,
but he's watching me.

06:01.018 --> 06:03.052
I could use a little help
on this.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.987
Yeah, love to,
but I got a thing.

06:05.055 --> 06:06.355
Hot date?

06:06.423 --> 06:07.690
Not exactly.

06:07.758 --> 06:10.593
Buddy of mine's in prison
down in Dade Federal pen.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.028
He's worried
that his life is in danger.

06:12.095 --> 06:13.296
Anyway, sorry, Mike.

06:13.363 --> 06:14.730
The guy was an asset of mine
in Colombia.

06:14.798 --> 06:15.998
He saved my butt.
I owe him.

06:16.066 --> 06:17.667
Fi?

06:17.734 --> 06:18.901
I'll go find a shovel.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.448
Hey, Juan.

06:32.516 --> 06:35.117
You're looking...
Well rested, buddy.

06:35.185 --> 06:36.719
Good to see you, Sam.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.821
So, I got a call
from your attorney.

06:38.889 --> 06:41.290
He said you thought your life
was in danger?

06:44.728 --> 06:47.063
Damn attorneys.
They don't know when to shut up.

06:47.130 --> 06:49.966
He was just supposed to talk
to you about some estate issues.

06:50.033 --> 06:52.735
Estate issues. Right.
As in, when you're dead.

06:52.803 --> 06:53.970
Juan, come on.

06:54.037 --> 06:55.438
I doubt that you would have
appointed me

06:55.506 --> 06:56.672
as your executor
out of the blue.

06:56.740 --> 06:57.974
Why don't you just tell me
what's going on?

07:00.210 --> 07:01.777
Have you heard
of La Nación?

07:01.845 --> 07:03.012
The prison gang?

07:03.080 --> 07:04.614
Yeah.
One of the biggest around.

07:04.681 --> 07:06.582
There's a guy, Cruz.
He's high up in it.

07:06.650 --> 07:09.218
Found out what I was in for --
thought I could help him out.

07:09.286 --> 07:10.553
He wanted you
to wash some money?

07:12.055 --> 07:13.689
No.
Steal it from the gang.

07:13.757 --> 07:16.425
But, see, you're a smart guy,
and you don't have a death wish,

07:16.493 --> 07:19.495
so you said "no."

07:19.563 --> 07:20.930
Oh, Juan.

07:20.998 --> 07:23.199
Getting mixed up with
the Colombians was one thing.

07:23.267 --> 07:24.734
You know, they didn't give you
much choice.

07:24.801 --> 07:26.335
But this?
You think I had a choice?

07:26.403 --> 07:28.604
How was I supposed to survive
eight years in here?

07:28.672 --> 07:30.473
Anyway, he said
that if I helped him skim

07:30.541 --> 07:32.575
from the gang's account,
he would protect me.

07:32.643 --> 07:34.176
And so now the gang's
after you.

07:34.244 --> 07:35.545
No. He is.

07:35.612 --> 07:37.413
I have a week left
on my sentence.

07:37.481 --> 07:39.382
He's afraid I'll talk
when I get out.

07:39.449 --> 07:41.284
He's spreading the word
that I disrespected him

07:41.351 --> 07:43.753
so it doesn't look suspicious
when he shanks me.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.521
I just heard about it
this morning.

07:47.724 --> 07:48.925
I'll be dead
by tomorrow.

08:00.571 --> 08:02.905
Juan, you got to talk
to the cops.

08:02.973 --> 08:04.540
I mean, maybe we can get you
transferred.

08:04.608 --> 08:06.042
I'm not gonna snitch
on Cruz.

08:06.109 --> 08:07.743
They'll investigate
the whole gang.

08:07.811 --> 08:09.278
I might as well
invite La Nación

08:09.346 --> 08:10.813
to my family's house
for a barbecue.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.114
They'll kill everyone.

08:12.182 --> 08:14.317
Juan, there's got to be
something we can do here.

08:14.384 --> 08:15.484
I wish there was.

08:20.057 --> 08:22.925
Can I count on you to take care
of Lisa and the girls?

08:22.993 --> 08:23.993
Yeah.

08:24.061 --> 08:25.695
You can count on me.

09:02.132 --> 09:04.133
<i>When you realize</i>
<i>you're being followed,</i>

09:04.201 --> 09:06.669
<i>escaping isn't always</i>
<i>the best option.</i>

09:06.737 --> 09:08.938
<i>If your pursuers</i>
<i>don't know who you are,</i>

09:09.006 --> 09:11.374
<i>driving evasively,</i>
<i>calling the cops,</i>

09:11.441 --> 09:14.443
<i>or pulling a gun</i>
<i>will just send the message</i>

09:14.511 --> 09:16.045
<i>that you're a threat.</i>

09:16.113 --> 09:17.947
411.
How may I help you?

09:18.015 --> 09:20.416
Yeah, I'm currently
on Northwest 12th Street.

09:20.484 --> 09:23.219
I need the address of the
nearest criminal defense firm.

09:23.286 --> 09:24.820
One second.

09:24.888 --> 09:26.689
That would be
Keller & Associates.

09:26.757 --> 09:28.591
They're at
77 Shorebreak Lane.

09:28.659 --> 09:30.192
<i>Whenever possible,</i>

09:30.260 --> 09:32.228
<i>the best play</i>
<i>is to make the bad guys</i>

09:32.295 --> 09:34.830
<i>think you're not someone</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

09:34.898 --> 09:37.600
<i>If they think you might be</i>
<i>a cop who's onto them,</i>

09:37.668 --> 09:39.835
<i>you have to convince them</i>
<i>you're just a harmless attorney</i>

09:39.903 --> 09:41.604
<i>working on an appeal.</i>

09:41.672 --> 09:42.972
Oh, hey, counselor.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.007
Listen, you know, I've been
going over that case,

09:45.075 --> 09:47.476
and I wanted to, you know, talk
to you about it a little bit.

09:47.544 --> 09:49.278
Excuse me, who are you?
Oh, excuse me.

09:49.346 --> 09:51.414
You don't remember
the Bennigan subpoena?

09:51.481 --> 09:53.449
No, I don't.
Oh, come on. Hey, think harder, man.

09:53.517 --> 09:55.217
Hey, Sully!

09:55.285 --> 09:57.153
What's going on, buddy?
How you doing?

09:58.221 --> 10:00.956
Uh, Bennigan.
Hmm. Let me think.

10:01.024 --> 10:02.224
Forget it.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.726
Gringo's just
a lawyer, man. Go.

10:05.162 --> 10:07.129
Was that the guy who got
murdered over the parrot?

10:07.197 --> 10:08.364
Uh...No.

10:08.432 --> 10:10.266
But, boy, that sounds like
an interesting case.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.667
Catch you later.

10:16.373 --> 10:18.107
You want to break <i>in</i>
<i>to prison?</i>

10:18.175 --> 10:19.475
Are you insane?

10:19.543 --> 10:21.310
I mean, I can't protect my buddy
from here.

10:21.378 --> 10:23.012
Juan is out in a week.
How bad could it be?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.480
This is prison, Sam.

10:24.548 --> 10:26.315
I-I'm just guessing, but I think
it could be pretty bad.

10:26.383 --> 10:27.883
I owe this guy.

10:27.951 --> 10:30.252
Back in '95, I led a S.E.A.L.
team down to Colombia,

10:30.320 --> 10:31.554
you know,
as a "drug war" thing.

10:31.621 --> 10:34.223
Well, the Medellín boys
put a bomb in our hotel,

10:34.291 --> 10:35.691
but Juan tipped us off.

10:35.759 --> 10:37.159
Okay, I understand
you want to be loyal.

10:37.227 --> 10:38.561
This guy risked his life
and his family,

10:38.628 --> 10:40.429
and I'm not
gonna let him get killed

10:40.497 --> 10:42.298
by some prison-gang
lowlife.

10:42.365 --> 10:44.400
That lowlife had you followed
on your way out of the prison.

10:44.468 --> 10:46.702
Even if you were to get back in,
they'd recognize you.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.104
Okay, so I'll shave my head
or whatever.

10:48.171 --> 10:49.038
No, Sam. You can't.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.941
<i>I'll</i> do it.

10:52.008 --> 10:55.044
You would do that
for my friend?

10:55.112 --> 10:56.512
I'd do that for <i>you.</i>

11:00.016 --> 11:01.550
Okay.

11:01.618 --> 11:03.786
I hate to interrupt
this, uh, beautiful moment

11:03.854 --> 11:05.087
you guys are having.

11:05.155 --> 11:06.422
Explain something to me.

11:06.490 --> 11:08.691
You're just gonna walk up
to a federal prison

11:08.759 --> 11:09.992
and say, "let me in"?

11:10.060 --> 11:11.861
Trust me,
I know a couple of people

11:11.928 --> 11:13.562
who would <i>love</i>
<i>to see me locked up.</i>

11:19.703 --> 11:21.871
Hey, don't forget to write,
Westen.

11:26.710 --> 11:27.977
Got to say, Westen --

11:28.044 --> 11:30.279
been looking forward to this day
for a long time.

11:30.347 --> 11:32.381
Except, in my dreams,
it plays out a little different.

11:32.449 --> 11:34.083
I'm sure.
You can fly?

11:34.151 --> 11:35.584
You get a longer stay,
for starters.

11:35.652 --> 11:36.719
Maybe next time.

11:36.787 --> 11:37.853
You make the arrangements
I needed?

11:37.921 --> 11:39.121
It wasn't a problem.

11:39.189 --> 11:41.223
You're sharing a cell
with this guy --

11:41.291 --> 11:43.125
Juan Ruiz,
whoever the hell this is.

11:43.193 --> 11:44.426
A friend of a friend.

11:44.494 --> 11:46.428
Our butts
are on the line here, Westen.

11:46.496 --> 11:48.230
I know we owe you a favor.
A <i>big</i> favor.

11:48.298 --> 11:50.132
All I'm saying is,
anything goes wrong,

11:50.200 --> 11:51.600
it gets splashed back
on us.

11:51.668 --> 11:53.769
I'll make sure
I don't make waves.

11:53.837 --> 11:56.539
We left you a present
in your cell -- a phone --

11:56.606 --> 11:58.707
just in case
you get into trouble.

11:58.775 --> 12:00.543
You'll be
the first one I call.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.651
Guess we'll see you
in a week, Westen...

12:08.718 --> 12:10.319
If you survive that long.

12:19.151 --> 12:22.253
<i>Every environment</i>
<i>has its rules and customs,</i>

12:22.321 --> 12:24.756
<i>and your survival</i>
<i>often depends on knowing them.</i>

12:24.824 --> 12:27.892
<i>In Russia,</i>
<i>you never refuse vodka,</i>

12:27.960 --> 12:30.395
<i>in Pakistan, you always clear</i>
<i>your dinner plate,</i>

12:30.463 --> 12:33.131
<i>and in prison, you're careful</i>
<i>about making eye contact.</i>

12:33.199 --> 12:36.234
<i>Too little eye contact,</i>
<i>and you become a victim.</i>

12:36.302 --> 12:39.437
<i>Too much eye contact,</i>
<i>and you become a threat.</i>

12:39.505 --> 12:42.106
<i>Either way, you're never more</i>
<i>than a couple of blinks away</i>

12:42.174 --> 12:44.576
<i>from getting a shiv</i>
<i>in your back.</i>

12:56.255 --> 12:58.957
I'm Michael Westen.
I'm your new cellmate.

12:59.024 --> 12:59.958
Juan Ruiz.

13:01.527 --> 13:03.294
What are you in for?

13:03.362 --> 13:05.597
Just keep talking
and try not to look surprised.

13:05.664 --> 13:07.165
I'm a friend of Sam Axe.

13:07.233 --> 13:10.068
I'm here to make sure you stay
alive until you're released.

13:10.135 --> 13:11.469
I don't understand.

13:11.537 --> 13:12.604
How did you get in?

13:12.671 --> 13:14.005
That's not important.

13:14.073 --> 13:15.540
What <i>is</i> important
is that from now on,

13:15.608 --> 13:17.809
you never leave my side.

13:17.877 --> 13:20.278
Like that.

13:23.749 --> 13:26.417
That is an example of leaving my side.
Don't do that.

13:26.485 --> 13:28.119
This is crazy.

13:28.187 --> 13:30.488
Didn't Sam tell you
about Cruz?

13:30.556 --> 13:32.690
He's a big dog
in La Nación.

13:32.758 --> 13:35.460
You think you're gonna keep him
away from me by yourself?

13:35.528 --> 13:36.694
In here?

13:36.762 --> 13:38.496
I guess I'll just have to
do my best.

13:38.564 --> 13:41.199
Listen, I-I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

13:41.267 --> 13:44.402
But this guy has killed three
people since he got locked up.

13:44.470 --> 13:46.504
When he wants someone dead,
they die.

13:46.572 --> 13:48.907
Do yourself a favor.
Stay away from me.

13:48.974 --> 13:50.608
Is that what you want me
to tell your wife,

13:50.676 --> 13:52.877
your kids --
you gave up?

13:52.945 --> 13:54.279
Why are you
doing this?!

13:54.346 --> 13:56.614
Because I believe
your life is worth saving.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.951
It's time you started
to believe it yourself.

14:11.430 --> 14:14.499
That's him.
That's Cruz.

14:14.567 --> 14:16.434
Told you it's not safe
to be with me.

14:19.838 --> 14:22.106
See the way
he's staring me down?

14:22.174 --> 14:25.843
No. He's -- he's just
checking out the new guy.

14:39.058 --> 14:41.159
What are you gonna do?

14:41.226 --> 14:42.226
Make nice.

14:44.296 --> 14:46.097
Hi.
Hey, hi.

14:46.165 --> 14:47.899
I'm Mike.

14:47.967 --> 14:49.500
Who are you, Mike?

14:49.568 --> 14:51.502
Oh, I'm just a guy
wrongly accused.

14:51.570 --> 14:52.870
Big misunderstanding.

14:52.938 --> 14:55.006
You know,
I borrowed a friend's car,

14:55.074 --> 14:58.309
Got popped for
a kilo of coke in my trunk.

14:58.377 --> 14:59.877
Lawyer says I can beat it --
you two friends?

15:01.213 --> 15:03.214
Him? O, he's --
he's my cellmate.

15:03.282 --> 15:04.515
Really?

15:06.485 --> 15:08.419
'Cause it looks like you
and that punk-ass

15:08.487 --> 15:09.787
are pretty tight,

15:09.855 --> 15:11.422
hanging out
like a couple of school girls.

15:11.490 --> 15:12.890
That's funny -- school girls.

15:15.761 --> 15:17.161
Just so that
we have no...

15:17.229 --> 15:18.663
"Misunderstandings,"
okay,

15:18.731 --> 15:22.400
this is my house,
and you're just a guest.

15:22.468 --> 15:24.702
So, I can treat you
like my friend,

15:24.770 --> 15:26.904
or I can treat you
like my bitch.

15:26.972 --> 15:27.939
Friend, please.
Friend.

15:28.007 --> 15:29.073
Okay.

15:29.141 --> 15:30.541
I don't want
any trouble.

15:30.609 --> 15:31.743
Okay.

15:31.810 --> 15:33.478
Is there anything
I can do for you,

15:33.545 --> 15:34.746
you know, or not do?

15:34.813 --> 15:36.914
Do you want me to be some place
at some time

15:36.982 --> 15:39.384
or not some place or Juan
to be -- to be or not --

15:39.451 --> 15:41.686
questions --
too many questions...

15:41.754 --> 15:43.154
You want to
make that court date,

15:43.222 --> 15:45.423
you'll make
no problems for me, okay?

15:45.491 --> 15:48.259
If I come by your cell,
you clear out.

15:48.327 --> 15:49.694
<i>Comprendes?</i>

15:49.762 --> 15:51.896
<i>Sí, sí. Comprendes.</i>
<i>Uh, no problemas.</i>

15:51.964 --> 15:52.997
Okay. Okay.
Fun. Done.

15:56.268 --> 15:58.803
Go back to your <i>pendejo</i> cellie
over there.

16:05.177 --> 16:06.744
I'm starting to think

16:06.812 --> 16:08.980
this is just Simon's version
of a sick joke.

16:09.048 --> 16:11.282
Well, so long as <i>you're</i>
<i>the punchline.</i>

16:11.350 --> 16:13.117
You know,
that's a cruel thing to say

16:13.185 --> 16:15.153
to a sweaty man
who's digging for a bomb.

16:15.220 --> 16:17.255
<i>Old cemeteries</i>
<i>are great hiding places,</i>

16:17.322 --> 16:19.590
<i>as long as you don't mind</i>
<i>desecrating a grave.</i>

16:19.658 --> 16:21.693
<i>People don't often go digging</i>
<i>in cemeteries,</i>

16:21.760 --> 16:23.494
<i>and unlike buildings or houses,</i>

16:23.562 --> 16:25.697
<i>they don't get demolished</i>
<i>or remodeled.</i>

16:25.764 --> 16:28.366
<i>Bury your stash near</i>
<i>an old, nondescript headstone</i>

16:28.434 --> 16:30.601
<i>and there's little chance</i>
<i>anyone will uncover it,</i>

16:30.669 --> 16:33.705
<i>Unless they're meant to.</i>

16:40.713 --> 16:42.513
Hey...

16:42.581 --> 16:43.815
Look what we have here.

16:43.882 --> 16:45.183
Doesn't look like
it's booby-trapped to me.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.884
Why don't you come down,
help me get this baby out?

16:46.952 --> 16:48.352
No! No, no, no!
Wait, wait!

16:48.420 --> 16:50.054
Don't touch it.
What?

16:51.423 --> 16:53.157
This has got
a silicone seal.

16:53.225 --> 16:55.259
That thing's airtight.
And?

16:55.327 --> 16:57.662
Whatever's in there ignites
on contact with air.
Ohh.

16:57.730 --> 16:59.063
Probably
a sodium metal.

16:59.131 --> 17:00.998
Open it...Boom.

17:01.066 --> 17:02.834
Best not to move it,
either.

17:02.901 --> 17:04.535
It may have
a trembler sensor.

17:04.603 --> 17:06.537
Oh, I see unstable minds
think alike.

17:06.605 --> 17:07.972
So, now what?

17:10.943 --> 17:12.477
See that liner?

17:12.544 --> 17:14.479
I think I know how Simon
planned to get into it.

17:14.546 --> 17:16.814
We need a circular saw
and some machine oil.

17:16.882 --> 17:19.416
We'll have to come back
to defuse this little toy.

17:19.484 --> 17:22.220
Well, I don't know which one of
us has a more dangerous gig --

17:22.287 --> 17:23.253
us or Mike.

17:23.321 --> 17:24.555
Probably Michael.

17:24.623 --> 17:26.190
We don't have to eat
prison food.

17:30.763 --> 17:32.497
You gonna eat that?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.667
<i>In the jungle,</i>

17:36.735 --> 17:38.970
<i>the first warning</i>
<i>that a predator is approaching</i>

17:39.037 --> 17:40.371
<i>is silence.</i>

17:40.439 --> 17:42.006
<i>When violence is imminent,</i>

17:42.074 --> 17:44.542
<i>animals instinctively know</i>
<i>that keeping quiet and still</i>

17:44.610 --> 17:46.277
<i>is their best shot at survival.</i>

17:46.345 --> 17:49.113
<i>Prison's a lot like the jungle.</i>

17:49.181 --> 17:50.515
<i>Silence is not a good sign.</i>

17:50.582 --> 17:53.050
<i>Averted eyes, stockpiled food,</i>

17:53.118 --> 17:55.386
<i>and guys wearing heavy coats</i>
<i>on a warm day</i>

17:55.454 --> 17:57.722
<i>also indicate</i>
<i>trouble's on the way.</i>

17:57.790 --> 17:59.690
I don't like that look. Are you gonna
be sick or something?

17:59.758 --> 18:01.793
It takes a little while to get used
to the cuisine here, but it's good.

18:01.860 --> 18:03.494
No one's come
within 10 feet of us

18:03.562 --> 18:04.695
in the last 15 minutes.

18:04.763 --> 18:06.697
See the looks?

18:10.235 --> 18:12.436
My guess is Cruz is gonna
make his move soon.

18:12.504 --> 18:14.038
Jesus.

18:14.106 --> 18:15.873
We got to find a place
to hide.

18:15.941 --> 18:17.408
Where's the library?

18:21.880 --> 18:23.948
This place has to have
a law section, right?

18:24.016 --> 18:25.783
It's a little late
to file an appeal.

18:25.851 --> 18:27.285
I already served
eight years.

18:27.352 --> 18:29.687
Case books usually come
in thick, hard covers.

18:29.755 --> 18:30.922
We need the big ones.

18:37.529 --> 18:39.163
Get it?

18:39.231 --> 18:40.898
<i>Suits of armor</i>
<i>fell out of fashion</i>

18:40.966 --> 18:42.433
<i>because the added protection</i>

18:42.501 --> 18:44.735
<i>isn't worth the trade-off</i>
<i>in speed and agility.</i>

18:44.803 --> 18:47.138
<i>Flak jackets and</i>
<i>bullet-proof vests are popular</i>

18:47.206 --> 18:48.739
<i>because they allow</i>
<i>for a free range of motion.</i>

18:48.807 --> 18:50.741
<i>The key is to shield your core</i>

18:50.809 --> 18:52.610
<i>and mentally prepare</i>

18:52.678 --> 18:54.979
<i>for strikes against</i>
<i>your unprotected arms and legs.</i>

18:55.047 --> 18:58.216
<i>All lightweight armor</i>
<i>is vulnerable to some extent.</i>

18:58.283 --> 19:00.918
<i>Layered book cardboard</i>
<i>won't stop a bullet,</i>

19:00.986 --> 19:04.155
<i>but it's dense enough to thwart</i>
<i>all but the sharpest blades.</i>

19:04.223 --> 19:05.656
Let's go.
Why?

19:05.724 --> 19:07.425
You think he'll find us here?
I don't know.

19:07.492 --> 19:09.126
But if we stay here,
Cruz can come at us

19:09.194 --> 19:10.461
from too many
different angles.

19:10.529 --> 19:12.530
We need to get to
a more defensible position.

19:12.598 --> 19:14.165
You got some place in mind?
Your cell.

19:22.207 --> 19:23.407
What?

19:23.475 --> 19:24.742
Elena and Sarah,
my girls.

19:24.810 --> 19:26.277
I was just saying
their names.

19:26.345 --> 19:27.879
Listen.
We don't have to win.

19:27.946 --> 19:29.680
We just have to survive
long enough

19:29.748 --> 19:31.148
until the floor guard arrives.

19:37.856 --> 19:39.290
Uh...

19:39.358 --> 19:42.493
Looks like the floor guard
is not helping us.

19:42.561 --> 19:43.761
He's with Cruz.

19:45.964 --> 19:48.099
We're gonna have to wait for
the block guards to come for us.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.100
Get up there.

20:00.646 --> 20:03.080
What are you gonna do
with that?

20:03.148 --> 20:04.582
Fight them off.
With a hand towel?!

20:04.650 --> 20:05.516
Why?
Do you have a gun?

20:09.755 --> 20:11.055
Take off...

20:11.123 --> 20:12.623
Guys,
we don't want any trouble.

20:12.691 --> 20:14.191
Maybe
you didn't hear me.

20:14.259 --> 20:16.594
You got five seconds
to clear out.

20:16.662 --> 20:19.063
<i>Fighting in tight quarters with</i>
<i>your back against a wall</i>

20:19.131 --> 20:21.832
<i>may cut off escape options,</i>
<i>but it creates a chokepoint</i>

20:21.900 --> 20:24.669
<i>and forces your opponents</i>
<i>to form a single-file line.</i>

20:24.736 --> 20:27.338
<i>If you have to fight a group,</i>

20:27.406 --> 20:28.839
<i>it's better to take them</i>
<i>one at a time.</i>

20:39.851 --> 20:41.452
Get back
in your cells.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.387
Get back! Now!

20:43.455 --> 20:44.822
Everyone back!

20:46.959 --> 20:47.959
He missed!

20:48.026 --> 20:49.427
I don't know
who you are,

20:49.494 --> 20:51.629
but if you think this is over,
this is not over.

20:51.697 --> 20:54.065
I'm gonna throw
a big party here tomorrow,

20:54.132 --> 20:56.600
and this whole place
is gonna get crazy.

20:56.668 --> 20:59.170
And the two of you?
You're my guests of honor.

21:09.999 --> 21:12.367
See that guy that Cruz
is talking to?

21:12.435 --> 21:15.404
That's the head of
the South Dade Aryan Nation.

21:15.471 --> 21:16.772
That is...

21:16.839 --> 21:18.206
Not surprising.

21:18.274 --> 21:20.375
The S.S. tattoo
kind of gave it away.

21:20.443 --> 21:21.643
It doesn't make
any sense.

21:21.711 --> 21:23.011
The Aryans are always at war
with La Nación.

21:23.079 --> 21:25.614
Exactly. So why not make money
from starting one?

21:25.681 --> 21:26.948
That's a negotiation.

21:27.016 --> 21:28.350
Cruz is gonna start
a riot.

21:28.418 --> 21:30.318
That's what he meant
by "having a party."

21:30.386 --> 21:31.620
Cruz is smart.

21:31.687 --> 21:34.489
His first attempt
raised security.

21:34.557 --> 21:36.725
He knows you're safe now
here in the cell,

21:36.793 --> 21:39.294
but a riot will give him
the chance to kill you

21:39.362 --> 21:40.962
when the guards
are distracted.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.130
Jesus.
We're dead.

21:42.198 --> 21:44.299
Only if we stay here.
Keep an eye out.

21:53.843 --> 21:55.343
Where did <i>that</i>
<i>come from?</i>

21:55.411 --> 21:57.012
The FBI,
believe it or not.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.481
Told me to use it
only in case of emergency.

21:59.549 --> 22:01.016
Now seems like
a good time.

22:04.187 --> 22:06.154
Hey, Mike, how's your stay
at the Greybar?

22:06.222 --> 22:07.923
Lots of rugged men
lifting weights,

22:07.990 --> 22:09.157
glowering
at each other?

22:09.225 --> 22:11.226
Hey, does your phone
have a camera on it?

22:11.294 --> 22:12.994
You guys are funny.
I'm in <i>prison.</i>

22:13.062 --> 22:14.162
Yeah, sorry, Mike.

22:14.230 --> 22:15.964
Watching Juan's back
isn't gonna work.

22:16.032 --> 22:17.532
Cruz is too powerful.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.402
He's planning a riot to kill us.
We're gonna have to break out.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.703
A prison break?!

22:21.771 --> 22:23.805
Mike, Juan has, like,
a week left on his sentence.

22:23.873 --> 22:26.274
And I'm telling you
he's leaving early --

22:26.342 --> 22:28.009
as a fugitive or as a corpse.

22:28.077 --> 22:29.177
It's our choice.

22:29.245 --> 22:30.312
Can you use the riot
as cover?

22:30.379 --> 22:33.081
That's the plan.

22:33.149 --> 22:35.750
There's a crooked guard
named Hill on the cellblock.

22:35.818 --> 22:37.652
It looks like Cruz
is paying him off.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.054
Think you can lean on him?

22:39.122 --> 22:40.555
Yeah,
anything you need, brother.

22:41.724 --> 22:42.657
Got to go.
I'll text you.

22:42.725 --> 22:43.992
Wow.

22:44.060 --> 22:45.494
That didn't
sound good at all.

22:45.561 --> 22:47.028
Yeah, well,
this doesn't <i>look</i> good.

22:47.096 --> 22:48.864
Gonna have to do something
about grandpa there

22:48.931 --> 22:50.232
before we can dig up
Simon's stash again.

22:50.299 --> 22:51.733
Well, you're gonna have to get
some reinforcements.

22:51.801 --> 22:52.968
I got to go pick up Jesse

22:53.035 --> 22:54.870
and run down this Hill character
for Mike.

23:09.018 --> 23:11.853
You sure this guy Hill
is in Cruz's pocket?

23:11.921 --> 23:14.022
I mean,
10 years as a prison guard.

23:14.090 --> 23:16.324
He's got a little house,
leases a compact sedan.

23:16.392 --> 23:17.926
Just doesn't look dirty
to me.

23:17.994 --> 23:19.394
He's not in it
for the money.

23:19.462 --> 23:21.396
Hill's brother is doing
a five-year stretch

23:21.464 --> 23:22.731
up in Ocala for burglary.

23:22.798 --> 23:25.033
La Nación has guys
in that joint.

23:25.101 --> 23:26.568
If Hill doesn't play nice
with Cruz...

23:26.636 --> 23:29.437
Little bro's cell turns into death row.
Wow.

23:29.505 --> 23:31.706
And you're thinking the fact that
this guy's getting blackmailed

23:31.774 --> 23:33.808
is something we can use
to <i>blackmail</i> him?

23:33.876 --> 23:35.577
Look, leaning on a guy
who's already squeezed

23:35.645 --> 23:37.913
doesn't exactly give me
the warm fuzzies, okay?

23:37.980 --> 23:40.081
But Mike's life
is on the line here.

23:41.918 --> 23:43.251
All right,
it's showtime.

23:43.319 --> 23:44.553
You gonna help me
or not?

23:44.620 --> 23:46.254
Yeah.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.092
George Hill, right?

23:51.160 --> 23:53.261
Who's asking?

23:53.329 --> 23:55.063
Just a couple of guys
looking for a favor.

23:55.131 --> 23:56.998
Got some friends staying
in South Dade Correctional.

23:57.066 --> 23:58.300
They're looking
to check out early,

23:58.367 --> 23:59.801
and you're gonna help.

23:59.869 --> 24:01.169
Yeah,
I don't think I will.

24:01.237 --> 24:03.572
Now, get the hell off my lawn
before I call the cops.

24:03.639 --> 24:04.839
You know what?
That's a great idea.

24:04.907 --> 24:06.308
Let's call the cops.

24:06.375 --> 24:07.776
We'll tell them
how La Nación

24:07.843 --> 24:10.679
is threatening to kill
your little brother in Ocala.

24:10.746 --> 24:12.914
Just takes one phone call
to open an investigation.

24:12.982 --> 24:14.783
Of course, I wouldn't want to be
your brother

24:14.850 --> 24:16.685
once it gets back to Cruz
that you ratted him out.

24:16.752 --> 24:18.153
No.

24:18.221 --> 24:19.721
My brother is just a kid.
He's not --

24:19.789 --> 24:21.856
we don't want anything to happen
to your little brother, okay?

24:21.924 --> 24:23.291
You do your part for us,

24:23.359 --> 24:24.726
we'll do our part to get rid
of your Cruz problem.

24:26.729 --> 24:27.929
What's my part?

24:27.997 --> 24:29.664
Well, first,
you're gonna tell us everything

24:29.732 --> 24:31.299
about South Dade Correctional's
riot procedures.

24:37.873 --> 24:39.274
It's not a great color
on you.

24:39.342 --> 24:41.276
Great to see you,
too, Fi.

24:41.344 --> 24:44.579
So, how's it going
with Simon's buried treasure?

24:44.647 --> 24:46.414
Well, it's being guarded
by a groundskeeper

24:46.482 --> 24:48.783
who's a little older than most
of the people in the ground.

24:48.851 --> 24:51.119
Sam's busy with this, so I'm gonna have to
recruit your mom to help me.

24:51.187 --> 24:53.321
Fiona --
I don't want to argue.

24:53.389 --> 24:54.990
We only have a few minutes,
so let's focus.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.296
I can't stop
thinking about you, baby.

25:01.364 --> 25:03.999
At night,
it gets so bad.

25:05.301 --> 25:06.668
Am I talking to you,
perv?!

25:06.736 --> 25:08.103
No, I am not.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.105
You want to keep your nose
out of our pillow talk?

25:12.241 --> 25:14.376
You been thinking
about me, too, baby?

25:14.443 --> 25:15.644
I think
he's gone now, Fi.

25:15.711 --> 25:17.579
You're no fun, Michael.

25:17.647 --> 25:18.947
Anyway...

25:19.015 --> 25:21.149
Our friend Hill
has been quite the help

25:21.217 --> 25:22.817
in getting
your early release.

25:22.885 --> 25:24.286
Once Cruz starts the riot,

25:24.353 --> 25:26.187
you and Juan
have about 20 minutes

25:26.255 --> 25:27.555
to get to the infirmary

25:27.623 --> 25:28.957
and hide inside
the pharmaceutical locker.

25:29.025 --> 25:32.627
As if the prison wasn't already
claustrophobic enough.

25:32.695 --> 25:34.596
Well, Hill said the thing's
industrial-size.

25:34.664 --> 25:37.265
It's standard procedure for
the guards to move it off site

25:37.333 --> 25:38.767
as soon as a riot starts.

25:38.834 --> 25:41.503
They don't want any inmates
raiding it during a commotion.

25:41.570 --> 25:43.238
Won't the guards
look inside it

25:43.306 --> 25:44.706
before they drive it off?

25:44.774 --> 25:48.209
Oh, they probably will,
but it'll be Sam and Jesse.

25:48.277 --> 25:51.713
Hill lent them his uniforms
and a key card.

25:51.781 --> 25:53.615
Sam is busy
forging copies of it.

26:00.323 --> 26:02.057
There's just
one problem.

26:02.124 --> 26:03.325
Hmm?

26:03.392 --> 26:05.660
The door to the infirmary
will be locked.

26:05.728 --> 26:07.228
Michael...

26:07.296 --> 26:09.497
Some things you have to do
for yourself.

26:14.003 --> 26:14.969
Okay, that's enough!

26:19.742 --> 26:21.343
You be good, baby.

26:42.331 --> 26:45.433
Is it just coincidental
that both Michael <i>and</i> Sam

26:45.501 --> 26:47.369
are unavailable
for look-out duty?

26:47.436 --> 26:49.204
They are busy
helping a friend.

26:49.271 --> 26:51.272
Aren't
they always?

26:51.340 --> 26:52.774
Should I worry?

26:52.842 --> 26:54.209
Uh...

26:54.276 --> 26:56.111
Honestly,
I would be more concerned

26:56.178 --> 26:58.680
about...Our little assignment
than theirs.

26:58.748 --> 27:01.883
Well, that's reassuring.

27:01.951 --> 27:04.352
<i>Chemicals like sodium metal</i>

27:04.420 --> 27:06.054
<i>will burn</i>
<i>when they come into contact</i>

27:06.122 --> 27:08.323
<i>with the moisture in the air,</i>
<i>which makes them ideal triggers</i>

27:08.391 --> 27:11.259
<i>for particularly nasty</i>
<i>booby traps.</i>

27:11.327 --> 27:12.694
<i>High school chemistry</i>
<i>also teaches us</i>

27:12.762 --> 27:16.064
<i>that oil and water don't mix.</i>

27:16.132 --> 27:18.500
<i>So to defuse a booby-trap</i>
<i>triggered by moisture,</i>

27:18.567 --> 27:20.602
<i>you submerge it in oil.</i>

27:20.669 --> 27:23.638
<i>It's messy, but it'll keep you</i>
<i>from being blown to bits.</i>

27:51.500 --> 27:53.201
Oh, it's like
Russian nesting dolls.

27:53.269 --> 27:55.437
It's cute, huh?

27:55.504 --> 27:57.138
Oh, don't worry,
it's safe now.

27:57.206 --> 27:58.973
It's totally harmless.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.475
No, no, no.
It's not that.

28:00.543 --> 28:02.243
Um, what do you people say?
"I think we have company"?

28:02.311 --> 28:03.578
Oh, damn it.

28:03.646 --> 28:06.448
Look, I need a sec to get
this out and cover it up.

28:06.515 --> 28:07.749
Could you, uh...
Yeah.

28:14.457 --> 28:16.891
I thought I saw somebody
over here.

28:16.959 --> 28:19.027
Are you in charge of this place?!
I'm the caretaker.

28:19.094 --> 28:21.062
You tell me what that truck
is doing here.

28:21.130 --> 28:23.698
What does it look like?
I had to hire a landscaper.

28:23.766 --> 28:24.999
Ma'am,
you can't do that.

28:25.067 --> 28:26.201
That's not authorized.

28:26.268 --> 28:28.069
Someone had to take care
of Quin's grave.

28:28.137 --> 28:29.537
You certainly haven't.

28:29.605 --> 28:31.806
Would you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

28:31.874 --> 28:33.441
You people
have no respect.

28:33.509 --> 28:34.943
I'm grieving here.

28:35.010 --> 28:38.413
I'm dealing with the pain
of a very serious loss,

28:38.481 --> 28:40.982
a-a-and you're just letting
his grave go to hell!

28:41.050 --> 28:43.485
Do you have any idea
how painful that is?

28:43.552 --> 28:44.853
Ma'am,
are you confused?

28:44.920 --> 28:46.988
This is
a <i>historic</i> cemetery.

28:47.056 --> 28:50.391
Everybody in here has been dead
for over a century.

28:50.459 --> 28:53.528
Well, it's not about
how <i>long</i> it's been.

28:53.596 --> 28:55.396
It's about
how much you love somebody.

28:55.464 --> 28:57.966
My great-great...

28:58.033 --> 29:00.602
Great-uncle Quinton...

29:00.669 --> 29:03.404
Has been
so important to our family.

29:03.472 --> 29:04.639
I-I'm sorry.

29:04.707 --> 29:06.441
We'll try
to do better?

29:06.509 --> 29:07.842
Thank you.

29:07.910 --> 29:09.677
Uh, Mrs. Becker, I'm done.
Are you ready?

29:09.745 --> 29:11.846
All right.

29:11.914 --> 29:13.081
Bye.

29:15.584 --> 29:18.119
The riot will probably start
in one of the common areas.

29:18.187 --> 29:19.621
Now, when it does,
the guards will try

29:19.688 --> 29:21.623
to lock down the cellblocks
and move in to stop it.

29:21.690 --> 29:23.625
That's when we'll make our move
all the way over here

29:23.692 --> 29:24.993
to the infirmary.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.761
You think the guards will be
too distracted to see us?

29:26.829 --> 29:30.198
If Cruz throws the kind of bash
he's promised,

29:30.266 --> 29:31.566
they'll have
their hands full.

29:31.634 --> 29:33.468
I don't want to get
my hopes up too high,

29:33.536 --> 29:34.836
but this sounds good
to me.

29:34.904 --> 29:36.971
But then again, I've never
really broke out of prison.

29:37.039 --> 29:38.373
No, neither have I.

29:39.842 --> 29:41.843
You two.
Come with us.

29:41.911 --> 29:42.944
Where are you
taking us?

29:43.012 --> 29:44.379
Time to see the barber.

29:44.446 --> 29:45.713
What's wrong
with our hair?

29:45.781 --> 29:46.948
Let's go!

29:51.620 --> 29:52.820
What's happening?

29:52.888 --> 29:55.823
I think Cruz's party
is about to get started.

30:03.977 --> 30:06.145
Should we run?
This is Cruz's cellblock.

30:06.213 --> 30:08.647
Until the riot starts,
we have nowhere to run <i>to.</i>

30:27.300 --> 30:28.501
What is this?

30:28.568 --> 30:30.903
It's the end of the line,
I guess.

30:30.971 --> 30:33.739
We're supposed to be responding
to a Code Black

30:33.807 --> 30:35.341
in cellblock "A"
when this goes down.

30:35.409 --> 30:36.609
Now, the deal wa--

30:43.617 --> 30:45.418
I know
what the deal was.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.555
Attention, we have
a Code Black in progress.

30:49.623 --> 30:51.590
Mobilize response team
immediately.

30:54.594 --> 30:57.763
There's gonna be a lot of bodies
when this is done --

30:57.831 --> 31:01.767
a lot of guards, inmates...
Snitches.

31:01.835 --> 31:02.835
Let Michael go.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.804
He's got no beef
with you.

31:04.871 --> 31:06.072
He <i>had</i> no beef
with me.

31:06.139 --> 31:07.973
It would've been quick for him
with my shiv,

31:08.041 --> 31:11.944
but now...It's gonna be
slow and painful

31:12.012 --> 31:13.112
for both of you.

31:34.000 --> 31:34.900
Aah!

31:38.338 --> 31:39.638
Let's go! We got to move!
I think it's broken.

31:54.688 --> 31:56.088
Put me down.

31:56.156 --> 31:57.957
You're never gonna be able
to carry me through there.

31:58.024 --> 31:59.258
It's the only way
to the infirmary.

31:59.326 --> 32:00.926
The guards will have already
locked down the yard.

32:00.994 --> 32:02.495
We have 10 minutes!

32:02.562 --> 32:04.096
What are you doing?

32:04.164 --> 32:05.865
You did your best.
I appreciate it.

32:05.932 --> 32:07.133
But Cruz is coming.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.001
You got to get out of here,
or you're dead.

32:12.506 --> 32:14.874
We're already set up
to get someone out of here.

32:14.941 --> 32:17.676
If you're staying here,
I guess Cruz will have to leave.

32:17.744 --> 32:18.911
Come on.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.980
Okay.

32:21.047 --> 32:23.482
Get in here.
Keep your head down.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.384
How are you gonna get into the infirmary?
I'm working on it.

32:30.390 --> 32:32.057
Down on the ground!
On the ground! Now!

32:32.125 --> 32:34.160
Down! Down!
All the way!

32:34.227 --> 32:35.895
Get down!
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

32:35.962 --> 32:36.996
Down! Get down!
Thank you.

32:37.063 --> 32:38.797
This guy Cruz
is no joke.

32:38.865 --> 32:40.599
He's really stirring up
a hornet's nest.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.434
Well, let's hope Mike and Juan are not
in the middle of it.

32:44.538 --> 32:45.571
Mike,
you and Juan all right?

32:45.639 --> 32:47.840
I'm fine,
but Juan's leg is busted.

32:47.908 --> 32:49.608
He's not making it
to the infirmary.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.777
Mike, he <i>has</i> to.
He can't, Sam!

32:51.845 --> 32:53.546
That's why we're gonna give Cruz
an early release.

32:55.549 --> 32:57.483
Mr. Westen,
you're a very clever man.

32:57.551 --> 32:59.185
Cruz is already
looking for us.

32:59.252 --> 33:02.054
If he found out that we're
holed up in the infirmary...

33:02.122 --> 33:03.656
I'll make sure
that he does.

33:10.330 --> 33:11.764
What?

33:11.831 --> 33:13.499
Yeah, hey, your pal Cruz
is hunting for my friends.

33:13.567 --> 33:15.401
I want you to make sure
that he gets the message

33:15.468 --> 33:17.236
that he can find them
in the infirmary.

33:17.304 --> 33:18.771
One of Cruz's guys
has a phone.

33:18.838 --> 33:20.039
I...Could call him.

33:20.106 --> 33:21.907
George, just remember
your brother now.

33:21.975 --> 33:24.577
You do this, and Cruz is not
gonna be a problem anymore.

33:24.644 --> 33:25.978
But you
got to do it fast.

33:28.448 --> 33:29.415
All clear.
Thanks, pal.

33:29.482 --> 33:30.983
I said
keep your head down.

33:38.592 --> 33:40.159
<i>Any medical facility</i>

33:40.227 --> 33:42.328
<i>is going to contain plenty</i>
<i>of combustible material.</i>

33:42.395 --> 33:44.330
<i>Pure oxygen can pack a punch</i>

33:44.397 --> 33:46.198
<i>if paired</i>
<i>with the right accelerant.</i>

33:48.735 --> 33:51.637
<i>The same properties that make</i>
<i>Ether a powerful anesthetic</i>

33:51.705 --> 33:53.672
<i>also makes it</i>
<i>extremely flammable.</i>

33:53.740 --> 33:56.275
<i>Alcohol is used</i>
<i>to sterilize wounds.</i>

33:56.343 --> 33:59.345
<i>Pour it on the floor, it can</i>
<i>also make an effective fuse.</i>

34:04.184 --> 34:06.518
Mike? Juan?

34:08.355 --> 34:11.290
Why don't you make it easier
on yourselves, <i>pendejos?</i>

34:13.326 --> 34:14.693
Get out here!

34:18.231 --> 34:21.367
<i>Any place where lots of dental</i>
<i>labwork is done on the premises</i>

34:21.434 --> 34:23.034
<i>will have a butane torch.</i>

34:28.742 --> 34:31.176
<i>It's used to cast molds</i>
<i>or teeth out of wax.</i>

34:37.751 --> 34:39.585
<i>It can also be used</i>
<i>for any other task</i>

34:39.652 --> 34:41.587
<i>that requires a controlled,</i>
<i>pointed flame.</i>

34:48.395 --> 34:49.527
Run!

35:03.643 --> 35:05.311
Yep.
This looks about right.

35:05.378 --> 35:07.746
I guess Cruz finally got a taste
of his own medicine.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.782
Okay. Okay.
I need a little help here.

35:15.422 --> 35:17.022
Hey, you're not going back
out there.

35:17.090 --> 35:18.791
Not without
an FBI escort.

35:21.461 --> 35:22.561
Agent Harris?

35:22.629 --> 35:24.496
You said to call
if there was trouble.

35:24.564 --> 35:26.565
You want to be a little
bit more specific, Westen?

35:33.006 --> 35:35.507
<i>Few incidents</i>
<i>inspire a police response</i>

35:35.575 --> 35:37.076
<i>as intense as a prison break.</i>

35:39.612 --> 35:41.780
<i>Local, state,</i>
<i>and federal authorities</i>

35:41.848 --> 35:43.849
<i>come after a fugitive</i>
<i>with everything they've got.</i>

35:46.019 --> 35:47.953
<i>Dump an escaped prisoner</i>
<i>someplace,</i>

35:48.021 --> 35:51.223
<i>give him a gun,</i>
<i>make a few calls,</i>

35:51.291 --> 35:53.692
<i>and you can guarantee</i>
<i>he'll make a lot of new friends</i>

35:53.760 --> 35:54.893
<i>in law enforcement.</i>

35:54.961 --> 35:57.463
Freeze! Don't move!
On your stomach!

35:57.530 --> 35:58.864
On your stomach!
Get on your stomach!

35:58.932 --> 36:00.466
Hands behind your back!
Hands behind your back!

36:05.939 --> 36:07.206
I don't know, Westen.

36:07.273 --> 36:09.274
It felt more right
when I was walking you <i>in.</i>

36:09.342 --> 36:11.009
I got to say,
I kind of agree with you.

36:11.077 --> 36:12.945
I'm not sure you don't deserve
another stretch --

36:13.012 --> 36:14.313
full-blown riot,

36:14.381 --> 36:16.749
prison-gang leader
tries to break out of jail,

36:16.816 --> 36:19.017
and now several guards
are admitting to taking bribes.

36:19.085 --> 36:21.520
You had nothing
to do with that?

36:21.588 --> 36:23.188
You really want to know?

36:24.924 --> 36:26.358
No.
I guess we don't.

36:31.598 --> 36:33.165
All right,
well, thanks for the update.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.134
I owe you.

36:35.201 --> 36:37.102
Well, that was my buddy
at the U.S. Attorney's office.

36:37.170 --> 36:38.704
They're going after Cruz?

36:38.772 --> 36:40.939
Well, it looks like
somebody else already did.

36:41.007 --> 36:43.242
Apparently, the day after
he was taken into custody,

36:43.309 --> 36:44.643
La Nación got wind

36:44.711 --> 36:46.578
that his hands were in
the coffers of the gang --

36:46.646 --> 36:48.647
decided to take matters
into their own hands.

36:48.715 --> 36:50.582
I don't know how I can ever
thank you and Michael.

36:50.650 --> 36:51.984
No thanks necessary.

36:52.051 --> 36:54.987
I promised you your family
would be taken care of,

36:55.054 --> 36:56.155
and they will be...

36:58.191 --> 36:59.858
...'Cause they
have you back.

37:24.616 --> 37:26.751
Hey, hey.
Hang on. Hang on.

37:28.454 --> 37:29.287
Okay, go.

37:30.522 --> 37:31.589
I'm not gonna miss

37:31.657 --> 37:33.658
the unveiling
of Simon's treasure trove.

37:47.306 --> 37:50.641
Coroner photos and...
High-school yearbooks.

37:50.709 --> 37:52.376
It's a rare
combination.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.145
Here we go.
"Berlin 2007."

37:54.213 --> 37:56.180
This is the tape
Simon wanted me to hear.

37:56.248 --> 37:59.116
And you're gonna meet with Simon
tomorrow to talk about this.

37:59.184 --> 38:00.618
Given my last go-around
with Simon,

38:00.686 --> 38:02.954
I told Vaughn I wanted to
control the security this time.

38:03.021 --> 38:05.122
Simon and I are going to, uh,
meet outdoors,

38:05.190 --> 38:06.257
maybe along the beach.

38:06.325 --> 38:07.625
How romantic.

38:15.534 --> 38:18.569
<i>Vaughn.</i>
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

38:18.637 --> 38:20.371
<i>I'll give you</i>
<i>one guess.</i>

38:20.439 --> 38:21.539
<i>Simon?</i>

38:21.607 --> 38:22.807
<i>Surprised</i>
<i>to hear from me?</i>

38:22.875 --> 38:24.909
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>I'm right behind you.</i>

38:24.977 --> 38:26.110
<i>No.</i>

38:26.178 --> 38:28.112
<i>The end won't come</i>
<i>that quick,</i>

38:28.180 --> 38:30.348
<i>not like it did</i>
<i>for the men you sent for me.</i>

38:30.415 --> 38:32.884
<i>You'll find what's left of them</i>
<i>in my hotel room.</i>

38:32.951 --> 38:35.386
<i>Simon, I don't know what you're --</i>
<i>please, don't.</i>

38:35.454 --> 38:37.622
<i>I take it you've chosen</i>
<i>to terminate my services.</i>

38:37.689 --> 38:38.956
<i>You gave us no choice.</i>

38:39.024 --> 38:41.259
<i>We know you've been working</i>
<i>against us.</i>

38:41.326 --> 38:43.294
<i>Whatever will you do</i>
<i>without me?</i>

38:43.362 --> 38:45.730
<i>Oh, we found a replacement --</i>
<i>very promising.</i>

38:45.797 --> 38:47.198
<i>The name's Westen.</i>

38:47.266 --> 38:48.866
<i>If he doesn't work out,</i>
<i>there'll be another.</i>

38:48.934 --> 38:51.235
<i>The work continues.</i>

38:51.303 --> 38:52.770
<i>Well,</i>
<i>i guess this is goodbye.</i>

38:53.939 --> 38:55.540
<i>Simon?</i>

38:55.607 --> 38:56.741
I thought Vaughn told you

38:56.808 --> 38:58.543
he had nothing to do
with burning you.

38:58.610 --> 39:00.978
Obviously, he was one of the
people who pulled the trigger.

39:01.046 --> 39:02.547
So, Mike...

39:02.614 --> 39:03.748
What are you gonna do?

39:11.957 --> 39:13.424
I heard the tape.

39:13.492 --> 39:16.060
Now I know Vaughn
helped <i>choose</i> me.

39:16.128 --> 39:18.329
I want to thank you
for that.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.731
Hallelujah!

39:20.799 --> 39:23.367
"Therefore,
rejecting all falsity,

39:23.435 --> 39:27.038
let everyone rejoice
in the truth with his brothers."

39:31.510 --> 39:33.144
That's what we are,
Michael...

39:33.211 --> 39:34.245
Brothers.

39:34.313 --> 39:35.613
Whatever you say,
Simon.

39:35.681 --> 39:37.815
I still want to know
what the bible decodes

39:37.883 --> 39:39.150
and who's after it.

39:39.217 --> 39:41.619
The man who tried to take
the bible --

39:41.687 --> 39:43.821
he's not like
you or me, Michael.

39:43.889 --> 39:47.358
We're just pawns in
a very, very large chess game.

39:47.426 --> 39:48.926
But he's...

39:48.994 --> 39:50.628
Well, he's more like
a King.

39:50.696 --> 39:51.963
Last time I checked,

39:52.030 --> 39:53.731
a pawn can still take
a King.

39:53.799 --> 39:55.633
I guess we'll find out.

39:55.701 --> 39:58.102
The man's name
is John Barrett.

39:58.170 --> 39:59.704
Ring any bells?

39:59.771 --> 40:02.807
The C.E.O.
of Drake Technologies?

40:02.874 --> 40:03.941
The same.

40:04.009 --> 40:06.077
Makes sense,
if you think about it.

40:06.144 --> 40:08.112
A multi-billion-dollar
corporation

40:08.180 --> 40:10.915
with holdings in telecom,
infrastructure, tech...

40:10.983 --> 40:12.550
Whatever they destroy,
they can rebuild.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.453
Quite the business model,
wouldn't you say?

40:15.520 --> 40:16.754
Simon,
what does the bible decode?

40:16.822 --> 40:18.389
Ohh...

40:18.457 --> 40:20.191
I'm not gonna tell.

40:20.258 --> 40:22.793
But let's put it
this way --

40:22.861 --> 40:24.629
if you deliver that book
to Mr. Barrett,

40:24.696 --> 40:26.130
he'll have everything
he needs

40:26.198 --> 40:27.965
to wipe out Vaughn
and his ilk completely.

40:28.033 --> 40:29.634
Let him, Michael.

40:29.701 --> 40:31.202
You'll be free...

40:31.269 --> 40:33.170
Free to go gunning
for Barrett yourself

40:33.238 --> 40:34.238
if you feel like it.

40:36.341 --> 40:38.342
Why tell me any of this?

40:38.410 --> 40:40.578
I would have worked
with the devil himself

40:40.646 --> 40:43.147
to take down those
sons of bitches that burned us.

40:43.215 --> 40:44.982
Sadly,
the devil's not available.

40:45.050 --> 40:47.251
I'll have to pin my hopes
on you.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.753
Go get 'em, brother.

41:10.308 --> 41:12.910
I'll be damned.

41:12.978 --> 41:15.212
John Barrett.

41:17.649 --> 41:19.750
How did you get Simon to talk,
Michael?

41:21.787 --> 41:24.021
He tried to convince me
to kill you.

41:26.825 --> 41:28.793
I let him believe
he convinced me.

41:28.860 --> 41:30.194
Should I be worried?

41:30.262 --> 41:32.963
I just told a psychopath
what he wanted to hear.

41:34.933 --> 41:37.935
So what's next?
You go after Barrett?

41:38.003 --> 41:41.138
Well,
it's not that simple.

41:41.206 --> 41:44.675
With a guy like Barrett, you
can't go in with guns blazing.

41:44.743 --> 41:47.278
It calls for a more...
Surgical approach.

41:47.345 --> 41:49.714
You're not done yet,

41:49.781 --> 41:52.016
but you made a hell of a lot
of headway.

41:52.084 --> 41:55.219
Here's to you, partner.
I'm glad we found each other.

41:57.789 --> 41:59.490
Me too.
