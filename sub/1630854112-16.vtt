asked yourself that question
before we got here, Chim?

I'm supposed to be buying

-First of all,

01:41.827 --> 01:43.751
Maddie is not Tatiana.

01:43.753 --> 01:47.347
And you are not the same person
you were back then.

01:47.349 --> 01:48.999
When you asked Tatiana
to marry you,

01:49.001 --> 01:50.943
it was for the wrong reasons.

But with Maddie,
you already have that.

that she doesn't even want?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.862

talked about this

02:01.864 --> 02:03.347
since the accountant thing?

02:03.349 --> 02:04.197
I thought you said
you were gonna discuss it.

02:04.199 --> 02:05.440
That's too awkward.

02:05.442 --> 02:07.108
If I bring it up now,
she's gonna think

02:07.110 --> 02:08.368
it's 'cause that accountant
brought it up.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.111
It's like that guy beat me
to the punch.

02:10.113 --> 02:12.447

a perfect opportunity

02:12.449 --> 02:15.450
to have an open and honest
discussion about marriage.

I mean, this is gonna sound
like a crazy question, but...

02:20.290 --> 02:24.143
how come you haven't
asked her before now?

02:24.145 --> 02:25.552
I think I always meant to ask,

02:25.554 --> 02:27.795
but just never seemed
like the right time, you know?

02:27.797 --> 02:29.130
When she was pregnant,

02:29.132 --> 02:30.465
I didn't want her to think
that was the only reason.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.058
And she struggled so much
after she had Jee,

02:32.060 --> 02:33.210
that definitely it wasn't

02:33.212 --> 02:34.987
the right time
to bring it up then.

very elaborate ceremonies.

You should have really left it
in a locker or something.

I didn't have time.
Maddie was right there.

07:43.689 --> 07:46.039
I'm worried she's gonna start
suspecting something.

07:46.041 --> 07:49.192
Relax, she's fine.
I ran interference for you.

07:49.194 --> 07:51.695
Yeah, that wasn't
awkward at all.

07:51.697 --> 07:56.883
So... what about a nice
romantic hot air balloon?

07:56.885 --> 07:59.369
No. Never ends well.

07:59.371 --> 08:01.796
I could charter a boat
at the marina,

08:01.798 --> 08:03.723
take her on a sunset cruise.

08:03.725 --> 08:07.227
You guys do realize you're
just pitching potential calls?

08:07.229 --> 08:09.212
What about a flash mob?

08:09.214 --> 08:11.381
That's fun, she'll never
see it coming.

08:11.383 --> 08:13.233
That's too public.
Your sister would hate that.

08:13.235 --> 08:14.567
I'm with her on that.

08:14.569 --> 08:16.903
Why would you want to invite
a bunch of strangers

08:16.905 --> 08:18.238
into your moment?

08:18.240 --> 08:20.832
So what about you and Karen?
Who asked who?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.650
Well, we both asked.

08:22.652 --> 08:25.319
We went on a weekend getaway,
spur of the moment--

08:25.321 --> 08:27.154
I had a ring and everything.

08:27.156 --> 08:29.341
It turns out, so did she.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.585
We were both plotting to
propose that weekend.

08:32.587 --> 08:33.419
So we did.

08:33.421 --> 08:34.996
Couldn't ask for a clearer sign

08:34.998 --> 08:36.422
that you two are meant
to be together.

08:36.424 --> 08:38.908
(sighs)
I had a pretty clear sign, too.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.426
Shannon got pregnant.

08:40.428 --> 08:43.170
When she told me the news,
I said, "We should get married."

08:43.172 --> 08:45.172
I barely even asked.

08:45.174 --> 08:46.432
But you said I got to
have a plan.

08:46.434 --> 08:48.935
Proposals are
a whole thing, right?

08:48.937 --> 08:50.362
So is riling you up, Chim.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.105
Chim, just remember
what I told you.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.532
No matter what you decide to do,

08:53.534 --> 08:55.942
she's gonna love it
and she's gonna say yes.

08:55.944 --> 08:57.443
Exactly.

08:57.445 --> 09:01.447
It doesn't have to be
a big over-the-top production.

09:01.449 --> 09:04.543
Don't overthink it.
And don't listen to Eddie.

All right, let's get in there.

11:30.098 --> 11:32.265
(Molly choking)

11:32.267 --> 11:33.507
Looks like
she's still breathing,

11:33.509 --> 11:35.527
airways may not be
completely compromised.

11:35.529 --> 11:39.572
Let's get her in position
for abdominal thrusts.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.017
(grunting)

11:43.019 --> 11:45.094
(coughs)

11:45.096 --> 11:46.204
HEN:
Nothing.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.189
Whatever is in there
must be small.

11:48.191 --> 11:49.207
We got to take a look.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.950
Here, here.
Let's have you sit.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.860
Okay.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.938
-All right.
-(coughing)

11:54.940 --> 11:56.956
Ooh. That is not good.

11:56.958 --> 11:58.124
Oh. (exhales)

11:58.126 --> 12:01.886
My teeth are... (coughs)
Are they gone?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.388
Um, doesn't look like it,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.706
but there's definitely
something going on in there.

12:05.708 --> 12:06.632
All right.

12:06.634 --> 12:08.876
Oh.

12:08.878 --> 12:10.286
Let's see here.

12:10.288 --> 12:12.638
(groans)
Open wide for me.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.274
(gagging)

12:15.460 --> 12:18.052
There's some bleeding of
the soft palate.

12:18.054 --> 12:20.405
Hand me a pair of forceps, Chim.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.303
All right.

12:27.305 --> 12:29.289
Okay.

12:31.567 --> 12:35.069
Oh, yeah, that's definitely
not a tooth.

12:35.071 --> 12:37.071
Maybe a tonsil stone.

12:37.073 --> 12:38.664
A what?

12:38.666 --> 12:40.483
Small calcified masses

12:40.485 --> 12:43.169
that are produced by,
you guessed it, the tonsils.

12:43.171 --> 12:45.004
(raspy voice):
So, I'm not losing my teeth?

12:45.006 --> 12:47.490
Nope. Just some little lumps
of bacteria

12:47.492 --> 12:50.326
that form due to accumulated
mucus, food and debris

12:50.328 --> 12:51.995
that gets stuck back there.

12:51.997 --> 12:53.830
Hence the trademark smell.

12:53.832 --> 12:55.089
Ugh.

12:55.091 --> 12:56.349
(gagging)

12:56.351 --> 12:58.167
Easy does it,
that might be another one.

12:58.169 --> 13:00.169
-Ooh.
-HEN: Oh, ooh.

13:00.171 --> 13:01.428
Oh, oh, oh.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.339
-MOLLY: Ugh.
-CHIMNEY: Ugh.
-HEN: All right,

13:03.341 --> 13:05.099
let's-let's take
another look in there.

13:05.101 --> 13:09.954
Seems like your mouth
is cooking up a whole batch.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.623
All right.

13:12.517 --> 13:14.350
Please forgive me,
but I need this.

13:14.352 --> 13:16.853
All right, here we go.

13:16.855 --> 13:18.112
Let's get these guys out.

13:18.114 --> 13:20.356
BOBBY:
Dispatch, please be advised

13:20.358 --> 13:22.634
we have a patient who's gonna be
in need of emergency

13:22.636 --> 13:26.029
ear, nose and throat services
at Midtown United Hospital.

13:26.031 --> 13:27.196
Ma'am, let's get you
on this gurney.

13:27.198 --> 13:29.032
MOLLY:
Hospital?

13:29.034 --> 13:30.124
That's a hard no.

13:30.126 --> 13:31.792
That's not a yes-or-no question.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.369
It's a no.

13:33.371 --> 13:35.872
I can't subject anyone else
to this halitosis from hell.

13:35.874 --> 13:37.131
(coughs)

13:37.133 --> 13:38.483
I'll go to the dentist
in the morning.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.226
Oh, your dentist's not
qualified to handle this.

13:40.228 --> 13:42.303
Your tonsils are still
bleeding from the stones.

13:42.305 --> 13:44.138
HEN:
You could accidentally
inhale the blood

13:44.140 --> 13:46.883
which causes
aspiration pneumonia.

13:47.719 --> 13:50.053
That's when you choke
on your own blood

13:50.055 --> 13:51.571
and cause infection,

13:51.573 --> 13:53.222
which also creates
a lot of mucus, right, Cap?

13:53.224 --> 13:54.707
Oh, excessive amounts of mucus.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.393
HEN:
Then there's respiratory
failure, followed by death.

13:57.395 --> 13:59.987
Which is way more serious
than bad breath.

13:59.989 --> 14:01.747
(clears throat)

14:01.749 --> 14:03.967
(siren wailing)

14:05.345 --> 14:06.493
Line is set.

14:06.495 --> 14:09.472
Go ahead and
switch on the pump, Chim.

14:10.909 --> 14:13.351
(beeps)

14:14.929 --> 14:16.095
What if she says no?

14:16.097 --> 14:18.189
-Who?
-Maddie.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.358
Everyone keeps telling me that
she's gonna say yes,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.843
no matter how I do it,
but that's not a given.

14:22.845 --> 14:24.178
Why would she say no?

14:24.180 --> 14:25.864
Maybe because of her history.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.106
Has she been married before?

14:27.108 --> 14:30.017
Yeah, she was.

14:30.019 --> 14:31.260
And it wasn't a good one.

14:31.262 --> 14:32.871
With everything
Maddie's been through,

14:32.873 --> 14:34.188
she has every reason to say

14:34.190 --> 14:35.874
she's not ready to
get married again.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.450
Or as Molly put it, a hard no.

14:37.452 --> 14:39.878
HEN:
If she says no--
which she won't--

14:39.880 --> 14:41.270
then you just don't get married.

14:41.272 --> 14:42.881
Everything stays the same.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.457
But what if that's
not what I want?

14:44.459 --> 14:46.626
What you want is important, too.

14:46.628 --> 14:50.430
Okay, you should really
not be talking right now.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.133
CHIMNEY:
I was wrong.

14:54.135 --> 14:55.393
I don't think
this was a good idea.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.896
I can't handle
Maddie turning me down.

14:57.898 --> 14:58.971
Chim...

14:58.973 --> 15:01.307
I'm not doing it.

15:01.309 --> 15:03.142
Ring's going back tomorrow.
Wedding's off.

15:03.144 --> 15:05.886
I can't believe this.

15:05.888 --> 15:07.964
(scoffs)

15:07.966 --> 15:10.325
(sighs)

15:13.896 --> 15:15.729
(exhales softly)

15:15.731 --> 15:16.989
Was I wrong?

15:16.991 --> 15:19.642
-He's spiraling, right?
-BUCK: Spiraling?

15:19.644 --> 15:24.163
Fighter jets spiral when
they lose control going Mach 1.

15:24.165 --> 15:27.333
Chimney's headed straight
into a wall at Mach 10.

15:27.335 --> 15:29.743
You, you got to help me
talk him down.

15:29.745 --> 15:31.154
HEN:
I don't know.

15:31.156 --> 15:34.415
Maybe it's better off
if we stay out of it.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.492
Uh, since when?
No, come on.

15:36.494 --> 15:38.344
We just-- we have to
make him realize

15:38.346 --> 15:40.163
he's putting too much
pressure on himself.

15:40.165 --> 15:42.348
-You know how he is.
-Which is why

15:42.350 --> 15:45.092
I'm suggesting that we try
the hands-off approach.

15:45.094 --> 15:48.095
Let him come to whatever
decision he's gonna come to

15:48.097 --> 15:49.355
on his own.

15:49.357 --> 15:53.009
Uh... I mean, there's only
one right decision.

15:53.011 --> 15:55.511
He proposes, she says yes,

15:55.513 --> 15:59.657
it turns into the best decision
either of them have ever made.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.033
If he gets there.

16:01.035 --> 16:02.702
We'll just have to

16:02.704 --> 16:06.589
-wait and see how it plays out.
-How it plays out?

16:09.544 --> 16:11.636
Wait a minute--
you don't want to get involved

16:11.638 --> 16:13.972
'cause you don't want him
to marry Maddie.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.366
Hen, how can you
even think that?

16:17.368 --> 16:18.643
After everything
they've been through?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.052
How far they've come.

16:20.054 --> 16:21.813
Do you remember
where they were a year ago?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.130
I do.

16:23.132 --> 16:24.465
Maddie was gone,

16:24.467 --> 16:27.226
and Chimney was raising
Jee-Yun alone.

16:27.228 --> 16:29.970
Maddie was going through a lot,
and you know that.

16:29.972 --> 16:32.699
I know. She was sick.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.661
And I know that was...
that was terrifying

16:36.663 --> 16:38.312
and overwhelming for her,

16:38.314 --> 16:40.556
but the choice she made
gutted Chimney.

16:40.558 --> 16:42.908
-And he forgave her.
-Of course he did.

16:42.910 --> 16:44.318
'Cause he loves her.

16:44.320 --> 16:48.080
And she deserves to have
her happily ever after.

16:48.082 --> 16:51.843
Why is this always about
what Maddie deserves?

16:51.845 --> 16:53.327
And what's best for her?

16:53.329 --> 16:55.162
What about
what Chimney deserves?

16:55.164 --> 16:57.331
They both deserve to be happy.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.184
(sighs)
You're right.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.021
-You're absolutely right.
-No, don't do that.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.247
You're still blaming Maddie.

17:04.249 --> 17:06.507
I'm not blaming her.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.860
All I'm saying is that
their relationship

17:08.862 --> 17:12.421
has been one trauma after
the other from the beginning.

17:12.423 --> 17:15.015
Maybe they both need to,
to heal from that

17:15.017 --> 17:16.683
before jumping into marriage.

17:16.685 --> 17:18.594
What do you think the last year
has been for them?

17:18.596 --> 17:21.097
Then why is Chimney
freaking out the way he is?

17:21.099 --> 17:23.041
What do you mean?
It's Chimney... (stammers)

17:23.043 --> 17:26.026
Look, I-I know that we love
to give him a hard time

17:26.028 --> 17:28.046
because it's fun to watch

17:28.048 --> 17:30.439
Chimney spiral,
but in this case,

17:30.441 --> 17:34.777
I think that anxiety is coming
from a very real place--

17:34.779 --> 17:36.128
fear.

17:37.131 --> 17:40.725
And he may not be able to
voice it, but I am.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.286
He's my best friend.

17:43.288 --> 17:46.731
And I don't want to
see him get hurt.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.881
Again.

17:47.883 --> 17:50.401
♪

18:00.471 --> 18:02.972
Mom, you said we were going
to the bookstore.

18:02.974 --> 18:04.231
I don't think this is the way.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.491
(sighs)
The bookstore's last, baby.

18:05.493 --> 18:07.568
Whatever we buy there
always weighs a ton.

18:07.570 --> 18:09.069
I'm strong.

18:09.071 --> 18:12.090
Yes, my little man,
you are very strong.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.758
Oh, my gosh. Hold on.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.985
Watch your step.
(sighs)

18:15.987 --> 18:19.672
So, um, I guess we're just gonna
forget that I need new shoes?

18:19.674 --> 18:22.100
-I did not forget.
-You forget everything, Mom.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.160
Okay, check the attitude,
young lady.

18:24.162 --> 18:27.830
-I'm hungry.
-Oh. Okay, great idea, Jayden.

18:27.832 --> 18:29.515
Time for a snack.
Let's go.

18:29.517 --> 18:32.443
Everyone just, here, here.
Come park it here.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.927
And, uh...

18:33.929 --> 18:36.672
Mom's gonna grab us some...

18:36.674 --> 18:37.840
Oh!

18:37.842 --> 18:39.508
Pretzels. Perfect.

18:39.510 --> 18:40.526
Okay, carbs.

18:40.528 --> 18:44.196
-Cinnamon raisin for me.
-I want a big one.

18:44.198 --> 18:47.107
Okay, I'm not taking orders.
They're pretzels.

18:47.109 --> 18:49.276

This wire's sliced through
the dermis of his arm.

But I'm still getting
a distal pulse.
