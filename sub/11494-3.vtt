03:04.415 --> 03:06.832
Easy, easy.

03:06.917 --> 03:08.467
Easy.

03:15.008 --> 03:16.475
What do you remember?

03:23.484 --> 03:25.650
They stabbed me.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.940
Olly...

03:33.744 --> 03:36.194
he put a knife in my heart.

03:42.035 --> 03:44.419
I shouldn't be here.

03:46.256 --> 03:48.707
The lady brought you back.

03:48.792 --> 03:52.544
Afterwards, after they stabbed you,

03:52.629 --> 03:54.796
after you died, where did you go?

03:54.932 --> 03:56.848
What did you see?

04:01.305 --> 04:03.105
Nothing.

04:06.026 --> 04:07.859
There was nothing at all.

04:12.149 --> 04:14.950
The Lord let you
come back for a reason.

04:16.904 --> 04:19.538
Stannis was not the prince
who was promised,

04:19.656 --> 04:21.238
but someone has to be.

04:25.829 --> 04:27.963
Could you give us a moment?

04:48.519 --> 04:51.069
You were dead.

04:51.188 --> 04:52.854
And now you're not.

04:54.358 --> 04:58.193
That's completely
fucking mad, seems to me.

04:58.328 --> 05:00.745
I can only imagine
how it seems to you.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.417
I did what I thought was right.

05:07.838 --> 05:09.538
And I got murdered for it.

05:09.673 --> 05:12.874
And now I'm back.

05:13.010 --> 05:14.376
Why?

05:14.511 --> 05:16.094
I don't know.

05:16.213 --> 05:18.597
Maybe we'll never know.

05:18.715 --> 05:20.682
What does it matter?

05:22.886 --> 05:24.436
You go on.

05:26.223 --> 05:28.723
You fight for as long as you can.

05:28.859 --> 05:31.726
You clean up as much
of the shit as you can.

05:32.946 --> 05:34.779
I don't know how to do that.

05:36.617 --> 05:38.533
I thought I did, but...

05:42.456 --> 05:44.322
I failed.

05:47.077 --> 05:49.377
Good.

05:49.463 --> 05:50.962
Now go fail again.

06:47.471 --> 06:49.721
They think you're some kind of god.

06:49.806 --> 06:52.641
The man who returned from the dead.

06:52.726 --> 06:54.309
I'm not a god.

06:54.394 --> 06:57.112
I know that.

06:58.649 --> 07:00.615
I saw your pecker.

07:00.701 --> 07:03.618
What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

07:29.346 --> 07:31.930
Your eyes are still brown.

07:32.015 --> 07:33.815
Is that still you in there?

07:33.900 --> 07:35.817
I think so.

07:38.355 --> 07:41.022
Hold off on burning my body for now.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.527
That's funny.

07:47.531 --> 07:49.414
You sure that's still you in there?

08:20.897 --> 08:22.864
You all right?

08:22.949 --> 08:25.567
Yes.
Yes, I'm fine.

08:28.622 --> 08:32.374
Did I ever tell you I used to
think the sea was called the see

08:32.458 --> 08:35.409
because it was nothing but water
as far as the eye could see?

08:35.495 --> 08:36.794
I don't think so.

08:36.913 --> 08:39.297
Sea, see.

08:39.416 --> 08:42.217
They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.303
Yeah, they do.

08:45.422 --> 08:48.390
It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

08:51.595 --> 08:54.646
Sam, are you going to be sick?

09:09.413 --> 09:12.113
Won't be long.
We'll be in the south soon.

09:12.249 --> 09:14.282
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

09:14.367 --> 09:19.871
Captain says it's the most
beautiful city in Westeros.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.374
Are you going to vomit again?

09:23.460 --> 09:25.677
No.
No, no, no.

09:27.881 --> 09:29.964
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.134
There won't be a place for
you there or for Little Sam.

09:33.270 --> 09:36.688
I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

09:36.807 --> 09:38.857
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

09:38.975 --> 09:42.360
I don't have a Jon Snow
or Maester Aemon

09:42.479 --> 09:45.280
to help me bend the rules.

09:45.365 --> 09:47.198
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

09:47.317 --> 09:48.983
By yourself?

09:49.069 --> 09:50.785
With a baby and no money?

09:52.038 --> 09:54.155
So if we're not going to Oldtown,

09:54.241 --> 09:55.406
where are you taking me?

09:56.827 --> 09:59.160
To my home.

09:59.246 --> 10:00.495
Horn Hill.

10:02.666 --> 10:05.083
My father's--
well, my father,

10:05.168 --> 10:08.753
but my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

10:08.839 --> 10:11.556
They'll take care of you both.

10:12.843 --> 10:14.926
"Wherever you go,
I go, too."

10:15.011 --> 10:16.761
<i>That's what you said.</i>

10:33.163 --> 10:36.414
I said that because I want
you and Little Sam to be safe.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.783
That's all I want--

10:38.869 --> 10:42.420
to become a maester so I can
help Jon when the time comes

10:42.539 --> 10:44.172
so you'll be safe.

10:44.257 --> 10:45.874
Us and everyone else in the world.

10:45.959 --> 10:48.092
I don't care about them.

10:48.211 --> 10:52.096
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.600
I care about you and him.

10:57.888 --> 11:00.054
I know that, Sam.

11:00.190 --> 11:02.390
And he does, too.

11:05.612 --> 11:07.695
You're the only one who ever has.

11:16.289 --> 11:18.907
If you think it's for the best,

11:18.992 --> 11:21.626
we trust you.

11:21.745 --> 11:24.629
I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

11:24.748 --> 11:28.216
I'd never do that
to the father of my son.

12:25.809 --> 12:28.309
That's my father.

12:28.395 --> 12:30.812
The man beside him is Howland Reed,

12:30.897 --> 12:32.447
Meera's father.

12:44.127 --> 12:45.994
Ser Arthur Dayne.

12:46.079 --> 12:48.212
The Sword of the Morning.

12:48.331 --> 12:51.082
Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

13:05.482 --> 13:07.231
Lord Stark.

13:07.350 --> 13:10.518
I looked for you on the Trident.

13:10.654 --> 13:12.603
We weren't there.

13:12.689 --> 13:14.272
Your friend the usurper

13:14.357 --> 13:17.358
would lie beneath the
ground if we had been.

13:17.444 --> 13:19.494
The Mad King is dead.

13:19.579 --> 13:21.663
Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

13:21.748 --> 13:24.165
Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

13:24.250 --> 13:26.167
Our prince wanted us here.

13:33.843 --> 13:35.543
Where's my sister?

13:38.048 --> 13:40.848
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

13:47.807 --> 13:50.308
And now it begins.

13:54.864 --> 13:56.898
No.

13:57.033 --> 13:58.950
Now it ends.

15:36.165 --> 15:38.166
He's better than my father.

15:38.251 --> 15:39.801
Far better.

15:44.891 --> 15:46.841
But Father beat him.

15:46.976 --> 15:49.010
Did he?

15:49.145 --> 15:51.095
I know he did.

15:51.181 --> 15:52.847
Heard the story a thousand times.

16:10.950 --> 16:12.783
He stabbed him in the back.

16:31.054 --> 16:33.554
What's in the tower?

16:33.640 --> 16:35.356
That's enough for one day.

16:35.441 --> 16:37.141
We'll visit again another time.

16:37.227 --> 16:39.810
- I want to see where he's going.
- Time to go.

16:41.397 --> 16:42.563
Father!

17:09.008 --> 17:10.675
Why did you do that?

17:10.760 --> 17:12.843
Take me back there.
I want to go back.

17:12.929 --> 17:14.228
No.

17:16.432 --> 17:18.816
- He heard me.
- Maybe.

17:18.935 --> 17:22.236
- Maybe he heard the wind.
- He heard me.

17:22.321 --> 17:25.323
The past is already written.
The ink is dry.

17:25.441 --> 17:27.742
What's in that tower?

17:27.827 --> 17:29.160
<i>I want to go back there.</i>

17:29.279 --> 17:32.029
I've told you many times,
stay too long

17:32.115 --> 17:34.582
where you don't belong
and you will never return.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.450
Why do I want to return?

17:36.586 --> 17:38.336
So I can be a cripple again?

17:38.454 --> 17:40.871
<i>So I can talk
to an old man in a tree?</i>

17:40.957 --> 17:43.007
You think I wanted to sit
here for 1,000 years

17:43.126 --> 17:44.959
watching the world from a distance

17:45.094 --> 17:46.460
as the roots grew through me?

17:46.596 --> 17:48.262
So why did you?

17:49.432 --> 17:51.132
I was waiting for you.

17:51.267 --> 17:53.017
I don't want to be you.

17:53.136 --> 17:55.770
I don't blame you.

17:57.106 --> 17:59.307
You won't be here forever.

17:59.442 --> 18:02.026
You won't be an old man in a tree.

18:02.145 --> 18:04.562
<i>But before you leave,</i>

18:04.647 --> 18:07.648
you must learn.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.567
Learn what?

18:09.652 --> 18:12.286
Everything.

18:32.613 --> 18:36.366
Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.904
Welcome home, Khaleesi.

19:38.929 --> 19:40.514
Go.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.442
What are you doing?!

19:52.526 --> 19:53.861
Take your hands off me!

19:53.944 --> 19:55.529
I will have your heads!

20:16.425 --> 20:18.385
You have made a mistake.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.554
One you will regret.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.264
I am the wife of the Great Khal.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.765
We know who you are.

20:23.849 --> 20:26.810
I remember you eating the stallion's heart.

20:27.978 --> 20:32.774
Why didn't you come to us
after Khal Drogo died?

20:32.858 --> 20:35.068
Because I am Daenerys Stormborn,

20:35.152 --> 20:36.570
the Breaker of Chains,

20:36.653 --> 20:38.739
the Queen of Meereen
and the Mother of Dragons.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.824
My place is not here with you.

20:40.908 --> 20:43.493
You were the wife of the Great Khal.

20:43.577 --> 20:48.248
You thought he would conquer the
world with you at his side.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.791
He didn't.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.378
I was the wife of the Great Khal.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.005
Khal Savo.

20:55.839 --> 21:00.969
I thought he would conquer the world
with me at his side.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.098
You're young.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.352
We were all young once.

21:08.852 --> 21:11.688
But we all understand the way things are.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.191
You will learn as well,

21:14.274 --> 21:17.235
if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.571
Where else would I go?

21:20.572 --> 21:22.741
Every Khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.

21:22.866 --> 21:26.787
Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.622
But you went out into the world.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.540
That is forbidden.

21:31.541 --> 21:35.921
All the khalasars have returned
for the Khalar Vezhven.

21:36.713 --> 21:42.052
They will decide which cities will be sacked
and which tribes will be enslaved.

21:42.386 --> 21:46.723
And now they must decide what to do
with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.686
With luck, your place will be here
with us, Mother of Dragons.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.730
It is the best you can hope for, now.

22:05.971 --> 22:08.972
I don't know how you stand
it in all that leather.

22:16.148 --> 22:18.065
If we could have the room.

22:28.494 --> 22:31.195
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

22:31.280 --> 22:35.488
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

22:35.585 --> 22:36.785
If you're going to torture me,

22:36.836 --> 22:38.919
just call them back
and get on with it.

22:39.055 --> 22:41.088
I am not a torturer.

22:42.558 --> 22:45.976
Though it so often is
what people deserve.

22:47.179 --> 22:49.930
And it does provide answers.

22:50.016 --> 22:52.900
But they're usually
the wrong answers.

22:52.985 --> 22:56.487
My job is to find the right answers.

22:56.606 --> 22:58.689
Do you know how I do that?

22:58.774 --> 23:02.076
I do it by making people happy.

23:02.161 --> 23:04.778
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

23:04.914 --> 23:08.115
That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

23:08.200 --> 23:10.501
That's all right.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.754
I know who you are
and what you've done.

23:15.525 --> 23:16.824
You've done a lot.

23:16.909 --> 23:19.470
You've sacrificed
your body for a cause,

23:19.495 --> 23:22.830
which is more than most people do.

23:22.975 --> 23:26.093
And you've helped
the Sons of the Harpy

23:26.118 --> 23:28.980
murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

23:29.005 --> 23:32.339
The Unsullied and the Second
Sons are foreign soldiers

23:32.425 --> 23:34.458
brought here by a foreign queen

23:34.544 --> 23:37.261
to destroy our city and our history.

23:37.380 --> 23:40.214
I understand.

23:40.299 --> 23:42.967
Well, that makes perfect sense

23:43.052 --> 23:45.803
from your perspective.

23:45.888 --> 23:49.690
I have a different
perspective, of course.

23:49.775 --> 23:53.227
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

23:53.362 --> 23:55.729
just as I will try
to see them from yours.

23:55.815 --> 23:58.032
Because that is the only way

23:58.117 --> 24:01.035
that I can make you and Dom happy.

24:04.123 --> 24:07.908
That is how
you pronounce it-- Dom?

24:08.044 --> 24:11.045
I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

24:12.582 --> 24:14.465
Such a handsome boy.

24:14.584 --> 24:18.085
Those big, brown eyes. Good
luck keeping the ladies away.

24:18.221 --> 24:22.339
Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

24:22.425 --> 24:25.309
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

24:25.428 --> 24:27.845
Children are blameless.

24:28.898 --> 24:31.098
I have never hurt them.

24:31.183 --> 24:33.517
Your boy is in no immediate danger,

24:33.603 --> 24:35.185
this I swear to you.

24:37.156 --> 24:39.073
But between us, dear,

24:39.158 --> 24:42.276
you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

24:42.411 --> 24:44.945
We both know the penalty
for that crime.

24:50.086 --> 24:53.754
How will poor Dom
get on without his mother?

24:53.839 --> 24:55.873
And with his breathing problem.

24:55.958 --> 24:58.292
If I tell you anything,
they'll kill me.

24:58.427 --> 25:00.594
So either you kill me or they do.

25:00.680 --> 25:04.214
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

25:05.768 --> 25:07.801
There is a third option, though.

25:07.887 --> 25:11.105
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

25:11.190 --> 25:15.809
I've already booked passage for
a woman and her young son.

25:15.945 --> 25:19.363
I'll even throw in a bag of
silver to help you start again.

25:19.482 --> 25:21.231
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask

25:21.317 --> 25:25.035
one of our leather-clad
friends back in to carry it.

25:25.154 --> 25:26.820
Far too heavy for me.

25:28.207 --> 25:30.074
The boat sails at dawn.

25:30.159 --> 25:32.960
You need to decide now.

25:33.045 --> 25:35.829
A new life for you and Dom

25:35.915 --> 25:37.548
or...

25:53.599 --> 25:55.399
What should we do while we wait?

25:55.518 --> 25:57.318
To pass the time, what should we do?

25:57.403 --> 25:59.737
<i>What should we talk about?</i>

26:02.074 --> 26:03.857
You speak 19 languages.

26:03.943 --> 26:07.277
You must occasionally use some
of them to talk about things.

26:07.363 --> 26:10.614
You two, you spend a great
deal of time together.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.867
What would you be talking
about if I weren't here?

26:14.954 --> 26:16.920
Patrol.

26:17.039 --> 26:19.673
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

26:19.759 --> 26:22.343
What we see on patrol.

26:22.428 --> 26:24.378
Who we captured on patrol.

26:24.463 --> 26:26.930
That's good.
That's very good.

26:29.051 --> 26:31.435
But that's a report.

26:31.554 --> 26:33.721
I was thinking more
of a conversation.

26:33.856 --> 26:36.890
A wise man once said the
true history of the world

26:36.976 --> 26:40.394
is the history of great
conversations in elegant rooms.

26:40.479 --> 26:42.396
Who said this?

26:42.481 --> 26:44.865
Me.

26:44.950 --> 26:46.900
Just now.

26:53.242 --> 26:55.492
All right, no conversations.

26:55.578 --> 26:57.461
Let's play a game.

27:00.332 --> 27:02.193
You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?

27:02.218 --> 27:03.527
Games are for children.

27:03.552 --> 27:05.169
<i>My master Kraznys</i>

27:05.254 --> 27:07.208
would sometimes make us play games.

27:07.233 --> 27:09.256
There, that's a start.

27:09.392 --> 27:13.060
- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.

27:13.145 --> 27:15.095
Not that.
Of course not that.

27:16.482 --> 27:18.732
Innocent games.
Fun games.

27:18.818 --> 27:20.317
Drinking games.

27:20.436 --> 27:22.603
<i>We do not drink.</i>

27:22.738 --> 27:24.738
Until you do.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.379
All right.
No drinking.

27:28.404 --> 27:30.244
We can play without drinking.

27:30.329 --> 27:32.590
It's a wonderful game.
I invented it.

27:32.615 --> 27:34.114
Here's how it works.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.260
I make a statement about your past.

27:36.285 --> 27:37.918
If I'm wrong, I drink.

27:38.003 --> 27:41.121
And if I'm right--

27:41.207 --> 27:44.625
maybe we can't play without drinking.

27:46.378 --> 27:48.846
Oh, you took your time.

27:48.964 --> 27:50.931
Sorry.

27:51.016 --> 27:54.745
I was busy learning who funds
the Sons of the Harpy.

27:54.770 --> 27:56.804
- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?

27:56.889 --> 27:59.022
The Good Masters of Astapor

27:59.141 --> 28:01.308
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

28:01.393 --> 28:04.394
With help from their
friends in Volantis.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.946
<i>You see?</i>

28:06.031 --> 28:08.532
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

28:08.651 --> 28:10.261
We only have to worry about

28:10.286 --> 28:12.486
the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.

28:12.571 --> 28:14.204
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.

28:14.323 --> 28:16.156
We will do it again
and execute the Masters.

28:16.242 --> 28:19.660
If the Unsullied march off to
reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,

28:19.745 --> 28:21.245
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

28:21.330 --> 28:23.881
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

28:23.999 --> 28:25.666
We cannot.

28:25.801 --> 28:28.552
The Masters speak only one language.

28:28.671 --> 28:30.337
They spoke it to me for many years.

28:30.422 --> 28:32.172
<i>I know it better
than my mother tongue.</i>

28:32.308 --> 28:35.976
If we want them to hear us, we
must speak it back to them.

28:36.061 --> 28:38.228
May it be the last
thing they ever hear.

28:38.347 --> 28:40.397
You may be right.

28:40.516 --> 28:42.483
<i>So we will fight them?</i>

28:42.568 --> 28:44.518
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

28:44.603 --> 28:47.521
It's a conversation.

28:47.606 --> 28:49.907
Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

28:50.025 --> 28:53.243
to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

28:53.362 --> 28:55.913
and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

28:56.031 --> 28:58.665
Of course.
Men can be fickle,

28:58.751 --> 29:01.869
but birds I always trust.

29:08.210 --> 29:11.094
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

29:11.213 --> 29:12.546
How's your mother's jaw?

29:12.631 --> 29:14.181
Better.

29:14.266 --> 29:15.693
And your father?

29:15.718 --> 29:18.185
No one's seen him.

29:18.270 --> 29:19.553
And no one will.

29:19.638 --> 29:21.271
That worked out rather nicely.

29:21.390 --> 29:23.390
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

29:23.526 --> 29:25.559
I don't think so.

29:25.694 --> 29:27.477
Do you miss him?

29:27.563 --> 29:30.147
He was nice.

29:30.232 --> 29:32.566
He called us his little birds.

29:32.651 --> 29:34.234
He gave us sweets.

29:36.488 --> 29:39.206
It's funny you should mention that.

29:40.960 --> 29:44.912
Guess what I happened to find today.

29:44.997 --> 29:48.582
Candied plums from Dorne.

29:52.137 --> 29:54.254
Now remember, if any of your friends

29:54.390 --> 29:57.591
like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

29:57.726 --> 30:02.095
All I need in return are whispers.

30:09.572 --> 30:11.355
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

30:11.440 --> 30:13.357
This is Ser Gregor.

30:13.442 --> 30:15.692
He's friends with all my friends.

30:21.533 --> 30:23.250
Run along now.

30:28.207 --> 30:29.923
Varys's little birds?

30:30.009 --> 30:31.508
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

30:31.627 --> 30:33.543
What did you do to him exactly?

30:33.629 --> 30:35.295
I haven't been able
to get a clear answer.

30:35.431 --> 30:37.464
Oh, a number of things.

30:37.549 --> 30:39.049
Does he understand what we're saying?

30:39.134 --> 30:41.385
I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

30:41.470 --> 30:43.720
complete sentences
in the first place.

30:45.474 --> 30:47.608
He understands well enough.

30:47.693 --> 30:49.726
So tell him to march into the sept

30:49.812 --> 30:52.446
and crush the High Sparrow's
head like a melon.

30:52.531 --> 30:55.949
The High Sparrow has hundreds of
Faith Militant surrounding him.

30:56.035 --> 30:58.318
Ser Gregor can't face them all.

30:58.404 --> 31:00.320
And he won't have to.

31:00.456 --> 31:02.456
He'll only have to face one.

31:04.576 --> 31:06.994
Has the Faith leveled
official charges yet?

31:07.079 --> 31:08.745
Not yet.

31:08.831 --> 31:11.999
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

31:12.134 --> 31:14.001
Don't stop at the city.

31:14.136 --> 31:16.420
I want little birds in Dorne,

31:16.505 --> 31:19.172
in Highgarden, in the North.

31:19.308 --> 31:22.342
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

31:22.478 --> 31:24.311
I want to hear it.

31:24.396 --> 31:27.014
If someone is laughing at the queen

31:27.099 --> 31:29.733
who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

31:29.852 --> 31:31.601
I want to hear.

31:31.687 --> 31:34.488
I want to know who they are.

31:34.573 --> 31:36.690
I want to know where they are.

31:43.042 --> 31:46.010
<i>As bad as Lord
Varys was, Qyburn is worse.</i>

31:46.035 --> 31:48.418
I told them all.
I told them.

31:48.537 --> 31:50.420
He's arrogant, dangerous.

31:50.539 --> 31:53.540
You don't get thrown out of the
Citadel without good reason.

31:53.676 --> 31:55.375
And no one listened to my advice.

31:55.511 --> 31:57.594
<i>So here we are.</i>

31:57.713 --> 32:00.013
And what he's done to Gregor Clegane

32:00.099 --> 32:02.049
<i>is an abomination.</i>

32:02.134 --> 32:05.218
We never sanctioned this experiment.

32:05.354 --> 32:07.888
I for one think it will
be in our best interest

32:08.023 --> 32:09.690
to have the beast dest--

32:14.563 --> 32:17.064
- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

32:17.199 --> 32:19.566
- My mother--
- I was invited, my dear,

32:19.651 --> 32:22.319
to help deal with several
troublesome issues,

32:22.404 --> 32:24.738
such as the queen's imprisonment.

32:24.823 --> 32:27.240
Thank you for bringing it up.

32:27.376 --> 32:31.078
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

32:31.163 --> 32:33.380
Margaery is the queen.

32:33.465 --> 32:35.248
You are not the queen

32:35.334 --> 32:37.384
<i>because you're not
married to the king.</i>

32:37.469 --> 32:39.169
I do appreciate these things

32:39.254 --> 32:42.889
can get a bit confusing
in your family.

32:42.975 --> 32:45.142
This is a small council meeting.

32:45.260 --> 32:47.394
You have no position
on the small council.

32:47.479 --> 32:49.262
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

32:49.348 --> 32:50.788
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

32:50.899 --> 32:52.599
does have a position
on the small council.

32:52.735 --> 32:55.268
Grand Maester Pycelle, would
you sanction that statement?

32:55.354 --> 32:57.437
Well, um...

32:57.573 --> 33:00.524
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower

33:00.609 --> 33:02.692
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

33:02.778 --> 33:05.362
<i>Of course, that was the Mad King.</i>

33:05.447 --> 33:07.080
King Robert saw things differently.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.865
And King--

33:12.171 --> 33:15.005
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

33:15.124 --> 33:17.290
Do you consider the
murder of your own blood

33:17.376 --> 33:19.376
a troublesome issue?

33:19.461 --> 33:21.405
The same women who murdered Myrcella

33:21.430 --> 33:23.880
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

33:23.966 --> 33:25.682
We've got a lot to discuss.

33:25.801 --> 33:28.185
All of us together.

33:28.303 --> 33:31.972
And seeing as you cannot make us
leave, we best get on with it.

33:34.143 --> 33:36.643
No, we cannot make you leave.

33:36.779 --> 33:39.863
And you cannot make us stay.

33:39.982 --> 33:43.567
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

34:24.943 --> 34:26.775
Your Grace.

34:26.862 --> 34:30.030
My mother would like to see her
daughter's final resting place.

34:30.165 --> 34:32.699
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

34:32.835 --> 34:34.701
That's not possible.
Not yet.

34:34.786 --> 34:36.453
When will it be possible?

34:36.538 --> 34:38.871
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

34:38.924 --> 34:41.541
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked

34:41.627 --> 34:44.043
through the streets
in front of the whole city.

34:44.179 --> 34:45.846
That wasn't the full atonement?

34:45.931 --> 34:47.714
No.

34:47.766 --> 34:50.934
She must stand trial
before seven septons

34:51.053 --> 34:53.186
so we can learn the true
extent of her sins.

34:53.272 --> 34:57.440
I want you to let her see
Myrcella's resting place.

34:57.559 --> 34:59.109
I am the king.

34:59.228 --> 35:00.694
You are.

35:02.731 --> 35:04.564
And what does that mean to you?

35:04.700 --> 35:06.066
<i>It means a great deal to me.</i>

35:06.151 --> 35:08.068
The Crown and the Faith

35:08.153 --> 35:10.287
are the twin pillars of the world.

35:10.405 --> 35:12.405
<i>Do you know who told me that?</i>

35:13.886 --> 35:15.219
Your mother.

35:15.244 --> 35:17.744
My mother who is unclean?

35:17.829 --> 35:21.798
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

35:40.519 --> 35:43.820
How do you think the Mother
Above first came to us?

35:44.823 --> 35:46.606
How did men and women

35:46.742 --> 35:50.193
first come to feel
the Mother's presence, hmm?

35:51.613 --> 35:53.413
It was through their own mothers.

35:56.118 --> 35:59.502
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

35:59.621 --> 36:03.790
But when she speaks of you, the
Mother's love outshines it all.

36:05.844 --> 36:08.795
Her love for you is more real

36:08.880 --> 36:10.797
than anything else in this world

36:10.882 --> 36:13.883
because it doesn't
come from this world.

36:13.969 --> 36:15.936
But you know that.

36:16.021 --> 36:18.638
You've felt it.

36:18.724 --> 36:20.941
You've seen her
when she talks to you.

36:23.028 --> 36:24.811
Yes.

36:24.896 --> 36:27.113
<i>It's a great gift.</i>

36:27.199 --> 36:29.199
One I never had.

36:30.819 --> 36:32.819
Envy.

36:32.955 --> 36:35.372
One more thing for me to atone for.

36:36.825 --> 36:38.708
Your Grace,
do you-- may I?

36:38.827 --> 36:40.377
Do you mind?

36:40.495 --> 36:41.828
It's my knees.

36:41.913 --> 36:43.797
Of course.

36:49.137 --> 36:53.006
When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

36:53.141 --> 36:55.342
she did it to get back to you.

36:55.427 --> 36:58.178
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

36:58.313 --> 37:00.063
through any more than
she's already endured.

37:00.182 --> 37:03.516
It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

37:03.652 --> 37:06.236
<i>They make their will known
to us and it's up to us</i>

37:06.355 --> 37:08.772
to either accept or reject it.

37:10.859 --> 37:12.525
Please.

37:17.866 --> 37:21.084
If we're to be just and good,

37:21.203 --> 37:23.920
then we accept it,
all of us, even kings.

37:24.039 --> 37:28.291
A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

37:28.377 --> 37:30.844
And no one is wiser than the gods.

37:33.382 --> 37:36.549
My grandfather once said
something similar.

37:36.685 --> 37:38.518
Except for the part about the gods.

37:38.603 --> 37:42.522
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

37:43.775 --> 37:45.809
As they work through your mother.

37:48.063 --> 37:50.113
There's so much good in all of us.

37:50.232 --> 37:53.900
The best we can do is to help
each other bring it out.

38:22.147 --> 38:23.930
Who are you?

38:24.015 --> 38:25.432
No one.

38:27.319 --> 38:29.819
<i>Who were you
before you came here?</i>

38:29.938 --> 38:31.571
<i>Arya Stark.</i>

38:33.575 --> 38:36.109
<i>Tell me about
Arya Stark's family.</i>

38:36.244 --> 38:39.112
Her father was Eddard Stark.

38:39.197 --> 38:41.748
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

38:41.833 --> 38:45.168
She had one sister, Sansa,

38:45.287 --> 38:47.170
and four brothers.

38:56.882 --> 38:58.631
Three brothers.

38:58.767 --> 39:01.551
<i>Robb, Bran, Rickon.</i>

39:03.522 --> 39:06.439
And a half-brother Jon.

39:07.609 --> 39:09.943
And where are they now?

39:10.028 --> 39:12.979
<i>They may be dead
for all a girl knows.</i>

39:23.291 --> 39:24.707
Tell me about the Hound.

39:26.628 --> 39:28.328
<i>Also dead.</i>

39:38.507 --> 39:41.724
<i>Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.</i>

39:44.179 --> 39:47.313
He was not on her list anymore.

39:47.399 --> 39:49.149
She had taken him off it.

39:49.234 --> 39:53.319
Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?

39:57.159 --> 39:59.409
<i>She did and she did not.</i>

40:02.914 --> 40:06.032
She sounds confused.

40:10.705 --> 40:14.541
Yes, she was.

40:18.763 --> 40:21.514
Who else was on Arya
Stark's funny little list?

40:21.600 --> 40:24.601
<i> Cersei Lannister.</i>

40:26.188 --> 40:27.353
<i>Gregor Clegane.</i>

40:29.274 --> 40:30.690
<i>Walder Frey.</i>

40:34.446 --> 40:37.197
<i>That's a short list.</i>

40:41.069 --> 40:43.703
<i>That can't be everyone
you want to kill.</i>

40:46.374 --> 40:48.992
Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?

40:51.997 --> 40:55.081
Which name would you
like a girl to speak?

41:31.036 --> 41:33.169
<i>If a girl tells me her name,</i>

41:33.288 --> 41:35.672
I will give her eyes back.

41:38.627 --> 41:40.593
A girl has no name.

41:44.299 --> 41:45.299
Come.

42:18.833 --> 42:21.000
If a girl is truly no one,

42:21.086 --> 42:23.503
<i>she has nothing to fear.</i>

42:48.863 --> 42:50.997
Who are you?

42:54.369 --> 42:56.252
No one.

43:05.847 --> 43:08.965
The Umbers are
a famously loyal house.

43:09.050 --> 43:11.551
Famously loyal to the Starks.

43:11.636 --> 43:14.687
And you, Lord Karstark.

43:14.773 --> 43:17.557
Your people share blood with
the Starks, don't they?

43:17.692 --> 43:20.309
But here we are.
Times change.

43:20.395 --> 43:22.729
When my father became
Warden of the North,

43:22.814 --> 43:24.814
<i>your house refused
to pledge their banners.</i>

43:24.899 --> 43:26.699
Your father was a cunt.

43:29.904 --> 43:32.121
My beloved father,
the Warden--

43:32.240 --> 43:35.375
Your father was a cunt
and that's why you killed him.

43:35.460 --> 43:38.388
<i>I might have done
the same to my father</i>

43:38.413 --> 43:40.963
if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

43:41.082 --> 43:43.883
My father was poisoned
by our enemies.

43:43.968 --> 43:45.718
Mmm.

43:45.804 --> 43:49.088
Why have you come to
Winterfell, Lord Umber?

43:49.224 --> 43:53.059
The bastard Jon Snow led an army
of wildlings past the Wall.

43:53.144 --> 43:55.561
We're farther north
than any of you fuckers.

43:55.647 --> 43:58.931
<i>Wildlings come down, we always
have to fight them first.</i>

43:59.017 --> 44:02.268
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

44:02.353 --> 44:05.104
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

44:05.190 --> 44:08.074
So now you've come seeking help?

44:08.159 --> 44:10.493
We need to help each other.

44:10.612 --> 44:14.163
The colder it gets, the farther
south those goat fuckers will roam.

44:14.282 --> 44:16.249
Won't take them long to get here.

44:16.334 --> 44:19.168
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

44:19.287 --> 44:20.887
If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

44:20.955 --> 44:23.423
<i>He knows this place
better than we ever will.</i>

44:26.544 --> 44:28.678
Pledge your banners to House Bolton.

44:28.797 --> 44:31.297
Swear loyalty to me
as Warden of the North

44:31.433 --> 44:33.933
and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard

44:34.018 --> 44:35.518
and all his wildling friends.

44:35.637 --> 44:37.804
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

44:37.939 --> 44:40.523
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

44:40.642 --> 44:42.642
I'm not doing that either.

44:42.777 --> 44:45.695
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

44:45.814 --> 44:48.648
Your father honored tradition.

44:48.733 --> 44:50.950
<i>Knelt for Robb Stark.</i>

44:51.035 --> 44:53.453
Called him King of the North.

44:53.538 --> 44:55.705
<i>Was Robb Stark right
to trust your father?</i>

44:55.824 --> 44:57.623
Then it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.

44:57.709 --> 45:00.827
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.

45:00.962 --> 45:02.545
I've got a gift for you.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.251
A girl, I hope.
I prefer redheads.

45:08.336 --> 45:11.337
A girl, aye.

45:12.674 --> 45:14.724
<i>A wild one.</i>

45:22.400 --> 45:24.233
I like them wild.

45:25.320 --> 45:28.821
And the boy, nice and young.

45:28.907 --> 45:31.073
The way Karstark likes them.

45:36.865 --> 45:38.364
Who's this?

45:38.449 --> 45:40.833
Rickon Stark.

45:47.926 --> 45:50.209
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

46:20.909 --> 46:23.743
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

46:35.223 --> 46:36.973
It's time.

47:14.379 --> 47:17.463
If you have any last
words, now is the time.

47:17.599 --> 47:19.849
You shouldn't be alive.

47:19.968 --> 47:21.884
It's not right.

47:23.054 --> 47:24.854
Neither was killing me.

47:29.193 --> 47:31.811
My mother's still
living at White Harbor.

47:31.946 --> 47:33.813
Could you write her?

47:33.948 --> 47:36.232
Tell her I died
fighting the wildlings.

47:44.659 --> 47:48.377
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

47:48.496 --> 47:52.465
Betray you or betray
the Night's Watch.

47:52.550 --> 47:55.635
You brought an army of
wildlings into our lands.

47:57.505 --> 48:00.339
An army of murderers and raiders.

48:00.475 --> 48:04.176
If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

48:04.262 --> 48:07.680
I pray I'd make
the right choice again.

48:07.815 --> 48:09.849
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

48:09.934 --> 48:12.935
I fought, I lost.

48:14.772 --> 48:16.689
Now I rest.

48:17.692 --> 48:21.610
But you, Lord Snow,

48:21.696 --> 48:24.113
you'll be fighting
their battles forever.

50:11.305 --> 50:13.222
We should burn the bodies.

50:14.725 --> 50:16.225
You should.

50:24.986 --> 50:27.286
What do you want me to do with this?

50:27.371 --> 50:29.071
Wear it.

50:29.157 --> 50:31.490
Burn it.

50:31.576 --> 50:33.793
Whatever you want.

50:33.878 --> 50:35.377
You have Castle Black.

50:42.170 --> 50:44.386
My watch is ended.

50:53.687 --> 51:04.300
