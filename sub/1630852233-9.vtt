WEBVTT

00:10.385 --> 00:11.678
Guess who's got another date

00:11.678 --> 00:15.098
with Vending Machine Guy
next Thursday? Tsss!

00:15.098 --> 00:16.933
Wow!
Uh-oh!

00:17.017 --> 00:19.060
You know, Thursday is low-key
the sexiest day of the week.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.479
What? Are you kidding me?
Saturday's the sexiest day.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.440
It's not called
<i>Thursday Night Fever.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.817
I'm partial to Wine Down
Wednesdays myself.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.861
Little Pinot
little <i>Peaky Blinders.</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:29.946
You all do know
what sexy means, right?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.281
Oh, I know.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.116
Look, Thursday
is the sexiest day

00:33.116 --> 00:35.285
because it's not as carefree
as Friday and Saturday.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.787
You got to come back to work
and deal with what you've done.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.497
Sounds like regret.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.874
That's sexy, right?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.792
Well,
I don't know about sexy,

00:42.876 --> 00:45.462
but my favorite day of the week
is Sunday.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.213
The good Lord's day.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.757
My favorite day is Tuesday.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.884
- Fascinating. Why?
- Because it's trash day.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.261
Yeah, mm-hmm. That checks out.
What about you?

00:53.345 --> 00:55.764
Oh, I like Fridays.
It's my cheat day.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.807
And what do you do
on your cheat day?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.934
Oh, I work out.
I just don't do cardio.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.062
Mondays are my absolute
favorite day

01:02.062 --> 01:04.147
because that's when I get to
come back here

01:04.147 --> 01:05.940
and see all you guys again.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.818
Fail! Fail.
- What?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.445
- That's a fail. Lord.
- The worst day of the week.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.335
All right! All right, guys!

01:25.335 --> 01:27.796
5, 6, 7, 8!

01:34.886 --> 01:36.763
No! No, no, no, guys!

01:36.763 --> 01:38.348
No TikTok dances!

01:38.348 --> 01:41.518
So I've been teaching step after
school here for a few weeks now,

01:41.518 --> 01:43.603
and I loved step so much
growing up.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.188
It provided me structure,

01:45.188 --> 01:46.856
you know,
that I didn't have at home.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.900
The fact that I can now
do that for these kids

01:48.900 --> 01:51.569
is just a real
full-circle moment.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.654
- Hey!
- Oh.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.239
I-I got -- I got a conflict.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.907
You don't know what it is yet.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.702
My class is putting on
a step show next Friday.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.245
We've made so much progress.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.205
Oh, we hear you in there,
stomping the yard.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.249
Yeah, you sound like
a regular Major Payne.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.917
Yes, well, we are
building something.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.001
I love a good step show.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.129
- It's so good for the kids.
- Right?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.214
Who gave you permission
to put this on my wall?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.299
Is this Comic Sans?

02:13.383 --> 02:14.634
Wait a minute. A step class?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.094
Why am I just
finding out about this?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.721
I've only been on vacation
for a week.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.390
Well, Ava, this has been
going on for three weeks,

02:20.390 --> 02:21.933
and you signed off on it.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.560
Oh, I sign anything
that's put in front of me.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.103
That's how I ended up
cosigning my ex's car loan.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.980
Thanks for your support.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.064
It's been going great.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.734
Well, it could be going better.
Step was my thing in college!

02:30.734 --> 02:32.652
Certainly wasn't academics.
I hate school.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.696
I was my sorority's Step Master!

02:34.696 --> 02:37.073
We won the step show
six years in a row.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.575
Wait. Six years? That --

02:38.575 --> 02:39.826
- You know what?
- Okay.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.953
We should teach
that step class together.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.330
Together? Like, you and me?

02:44.414 --> 02:45.623
What else does
"together" mean?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.959
You do know that this
happens after school?

02:48.043 --> 02:50.420
And when the bell rings,
all that's left of you

02:50.420 --> 02:52.922
is a lingering aroma
of Shalimar.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.758
Um, excuse me. It's Fenty.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.343
And the bell signals
the end of the day.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.636
Okay. You know there's no
extra money involved, right?

02:58.720 --> 02:59.763
Why y'all jumping me?!

02:59.763 --> 03:01.806
Can I not do something
out of the goodness of my heart?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.767
Well, you know what?

03:03.767 --> 03:05.852
If you can commit, then
I'd be more than happy

03:05.852 --> 03:07.729
to have another pair of feet around.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.856
Well, don't say it like that,
but I'll be there.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.232
And I would ask
what I would bring,

03:11.316 --> 03:13.109
but I already know
that I'm enough.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.448
Okay, listen, this has got
bad news written all over it.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.158
She only looks after herself.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.952
I've seen her push students out
of the way during a fire drill.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.329
- True.
- I'm gonna choose

03:24.329 --> 03:26.331
to look at the glass half-full.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.458
Okay. It's your glass.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.085
Just make sure Ava
doesn't spit in it.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.380
Mm.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.469
Step show.
Step show happening next Friday.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.680
<i>I get that Ava
hasn't historically been</i>

03:41.680 --> 03:42.722
the most reliable,

03:42.806 --> 03:44.641
but she seems really excited
about this,

03:44.641 --> 03:46.851
and I think we're gonna
make a great team.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.478
Step's all about
the fundamentals.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.147
She's the "fun,"
and I'm the "mentals."

03:51.231 --> 03:52.482
That didn't sound right.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.986
Oh, my God.
Is that pizza from Dough Nuts?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.030
Best in the city.
They bake it in an oven

03:59.114 --> 04:01.324
blessed by Pope John Paul II.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.410
John Paul II
wasn't the most progressive.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.161
Blesses a good oven, though.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.330
I'm just saying, wouldn't have
blessed a gay oven.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.333
Well, I think it's a fine pizza,
but it is nothing compared to

04:10.417 --> 04:12.919
the burrata pizza
at Pauly's. Mwah!

04:13.003 --> 04:14.546
Best pizza in Philly
is from Federico's.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.673
They put this mushroom extract
in the sauce

04:16.673 --> 04:18.633
that just kind of relaxes you
to high heaven.

04:18.717 --> 04:19.801
Yeah, you're both wrong.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.511
What makes Philly-style pizza?

04:21.511 --> 04:22.887
Uh, five things.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.848
You got your crust,
sauce, cheese,

04:24.848 --> 04:26.933
maybe some toppings,
and the last thing --

04:27.017 --> 04:28.268
it's made in Philadelphia.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.644
Okay, I got an idea --

04:29.728 --> 04:32.063
tomorrow, everybody bring in
their favorite pizza,

04:32.147 --> 04:34.149
- and we'll have an eat-off.
- Okay.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.358
Gregory!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.027
You never told us
your favorite pizza place.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.738
Oh, I should sit this one out.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.198
I'm more of
a Baltimore-style pizza guy.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.242
Ooh, Baltimore pizza.
I've never heard about that.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.618
What makes it so different?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.037
You never heard of
Baltimore style?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.538
Oh, it's -- it's great.

04:48.538 --> 04:52.417
It's, um, really crunchy...
and, like, wet.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.711
- Wet?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.880
No, it's -- it's --
it's, um -- It's great.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.299
Next time you're there,
go to, um...

04:59.299 --> 05:01.468
Say Cheese. Say Cheese Pizza.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.303
- Uh-huh.
- It's -- They soak it.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.930
It's, like, sopping. It's...mmm.

05:06.014 --> 05:09.100
I gotta go talk to a child
about a little thing.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.562
All right!

05:12.562 --> 05:15.190
Another fun day of step!

05:15.190 --> 05:17.859
Does anyone want to help
lead the warm-ups?

05:20.862 --> 05:21.863
Anyone?

05:21.863 --> 05:26.242
We like to play this fun game
called "call and no response."

05:26.326 --> 05:29.913
The kids are so good at it.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.248
I got the tacos!
Now, who got the tea?

05:32.332 --> 05:37.379
I heard Miss Cooper is dating
Mr. Peace and Coach Wilson.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.756
Ooh! Now, that's scandalous.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.801
Um, we actually usually begin
class by doing some stretches

05:42.801 --> 05:44.761
to make sure our bodies
are properly warmed up.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.262
Can't warm up on
an empty stomach.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.014
You can't just pump them
full of burritos,

05:48.098 --> 05:49.641
'cause they'll all throw up.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.810
Stepping is half stepping
and half farting around.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.186
They got to bond.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.814
The way we bond is via
structure and discipline.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.649
Nah, it's about who would
have your back at 3:00 a.m.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.609
at the after-after-party.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.445
Yeah, people having your back
by learning the steps

06:02.529 --> 06:04.406
is a sign that they'll
have your back out there.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.075
Janine! Are you saying you'd
square up on a stranger for me?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.451
Go ahead and get stuff started.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.787
I'll be back after I finish
my exciting blue slushy.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.455
This is exciting!

06:12.539 --> 06:16.167
Like in those videos with
the unlikely animal friends.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.378
You're like, "There's no way
a parakeet and crocodile

06:18.378 --> 06:20.130
can make it work and..."

06:20.130 --> 06:22.799
Actually, in the one
I just watched, they didn't.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.052
Uh, it was mislabeled.
Very tragic.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.638
This Pauly's Pizza is delish,
isn't it?

06:28.722 --> 06:31.307
It's decent, but it's not
as good as Dough Nuts. Sorry.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.019
Is anybody else not enjoying
the mouth-feel of Federico's?

06:34.019 --> 06:36.730
- Mnh-mnh.
- Greg?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.231
Oh, I mean, it's all
gonna be trash to me.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.191
I'm a Baltimore pizza guy,
like I said.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.736
Mm! You know what?
I thought that might happen.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.156
And so, as your best friend
here at Abbott,

06:46.156 --> 06:48.825
I took it upon myself to
drive two hours to Baltimore

06:48.825 --> 06:50.285
to get you your favorite pizza

06:50.285 --> 06:52.162
from Say Cheese.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.747
- Aww.
- That's crazy.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.958
I even asked the pizzaiolo to
make it extra crunchy and wet.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.171
- Bon appétit.
- Hmm.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.096
A-All right, man, you --
I can't do this.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.015
I-I just don't like pizza!

07:12.015 --> 07:13.266
What?!

07:13.350 --> 07:15.352
Say that again.
I don't think I heard you, son.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.271
Sweetheart, what do you mean
you don't like pizza?

07:18.355 --> 07:19.564
I just don't understand
the concept

07:19.564 --> 07:22.650
of having a bunch of ingredients
just slosh around in your mouth!

07:22.734 --> 07:24.027
It's not just pizza.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.278
I've got like
four or five things

07:25.362 --> 07:27.614
that I actually like,
and I just stick to those.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.701
Do you like pie?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.661
Fruit should not be hot.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.746
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.206
What about a rack of ribs?

07:36.206 --> 07:38.208
Dry rub, no sauce!

07:38.208 --> 07:40.752
That is not for me,
but I do like bacon.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.837
He's lying.
He doesn't like bacon.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.631
So, how could you not
like pizza, Gregory?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.341
How could you not like --
It's pizza!

07:46.341 --> 07:48.468
See? This is why I don't
ever tell anybody, okay?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.804
'Cause everyone always
freaks out and acts like
it's a personal attack.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.681
It's not my fault!
I was born this way.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.140
Don't you bring Lady Gaga
into this.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.899
He doesn't like bacon.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.567
Mm-mm-mm.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.944
I'm telling y'all,
it was like <i>Bring It On</i>

08:05.944 --> 08:07.320
but with Black people
on both sides,

08:07.404 --> 08:09.114
so you know they ain't
gonna never make that movie.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.408
- Oh, hey, girl!
- Hey!

08:11.408 --> 08:13.576
I was just telling them about
when I was on <i>106 & Park.</i>

08:13.660 --> 08:15.328
Me and Terrence J made our own
top-10 list that night,

08:15.412 --> 08:16.621
if you know what I mean.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.665
No, I hope they do not
know what you mean.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.042
You think they never seen
<i>106 & Park?</i>

08:21.126 --> 08:22.919
How about we put down
the chalupas

08:23.003 --> 08:25.338
since we didn't even get
to the routine last time

08:25.422 --> 08:27.007
because you ate too many
hard-shell tacos?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.551
Yep.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.052
Up and at 'em.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.598
Okay.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.645
5, 6, 7, 8.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.863
Okay. Cut, cut!

08:49.863 --> 08:51.364
That's enough of that.

08:51.448 --> 08:52.657
Uh, all right, hey, guys,

08:52.741 --> 08:54.075
why don't you go ahead
and take five?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.204
Uh
what's the problem?

08:58.288 --> 09:00.832
This royalty-free music is wack,
and these moves are tired.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.542
Where'd you get this routine
from? <i>Barney?</i>

09:02.542 --> 09:03.877
<i>The Big Book of Step.</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:05.295
I'm gonna assume that's <i>Barney.</i>

09:05.295 --> 09:07.172
How did you manage to
make stepping dorky?

09:07.172 --> 09:08.798
Somebody put on some good music.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.843
- Like Cardi?
- Great minds.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.220
Let's move this to the floor.
We gonna need some room.

09:14.304 --> 09:18.808
So, this is becoming like
the crocodile-parakeet video.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.893
She's the crocodile.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.187
<i>♪ Came from a chick
who...wanna touch ♪</i>

09:22.187 --> 09:24.064
<i>♪ I said my face bomb,
ass tight ♪</i>

09:24.064 --> 09:26.274
<i>♪ Racks stack up Shaq height,
jewelry on me ♪</i>

09:26.358 --> 09:27.817
Okay, they're not even
following the routine.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.070
Look, the point of this class
was to teach them

09:30.070 --> 09:32.489
structure and responsibility,
not Cardi B lyrics.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.782
Do you ever talk about anything

09:33.782 --> 09:35.492
other than structure
and responsibility?

09:35.492 --> 09:37.410
Yes, pride and leadership.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.205
Step is supposed to be fun
and about expressing yourself.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.873
You use that
to create a routine.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.917
Well, we have been working
on that routine

09:43.917 --> 09:45.001
really, really hard,

09:45.085 --> 09:48.380
and the kids would be devastated
if we had to start over.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.006
- Devastated?
- Yeah.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.467
How many of y'all
wanna do a new routine?

09:52.467 --> 09:55.053
Oh, my --

09:55.053 --> 09:56.137
Jasmine!

09:56.221 --> 09:58.056
<i>♪ Up, then it's stuck, huh,
I could make the party hot ♪</i>

09:58.056 --> 10:01.142
The people have spoken,
Lori Leftfoot.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.977
I think. It's time. For you.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.188
To move. Back.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.732
Try to keep up. Hey!

10:07.816 --> 10:09.025
<i>♪ Hit 'em with karate chop ♪</i>

10:09.109 --> 10:11.778
<i>♪ I'm forever poppin' it,

10:11.778 --> 10:13.613
<i>♪ Gotta argue with him

10:14.197 --> 10:16.449
Let's go, Step Queen.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.160
Let's go, Step Queen.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.787
- Hey, Janine.
- Hey.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.331
- What are you doing?
- Step Queen?

10:23.415 --> 10:25.625
Well, I have been ousted.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.838
The class chose to learn
from Ava instead of me, so...

10:29.838 --> 10:31.214
That's okay!

10:31.214 --> 10:34.551
I am, uh, getting ready so that
I don't have to stay ready.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.012
Don't you mean get --

10:37.012 --> 10:39.431
Hey, what if we all
just started a step class?

10:39.431 --> 10:41.099
Yes!

10:41.099 --> 10:44.060
Uh, no, actually,
I probably shouldn't.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.396
So, Ava's teaching the class
and the kids are into it?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.064
Yeah, you know,
but th-they're children.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.524
They don't really -- They don't
know what they're doing.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.776
Well, it sounds like they're
really engaged, Ava's engaged.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.194
Wasn't that the whole plan?

10:56.239 --> 10:59.117
That's true. Yeah.

10:59.117 --> 11:02.996
Ugh. Guess it just hurts
that they didn't choose me.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.873
You know what? Who cares?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.542
You know, just because
one person or some people

11:07.542 --> 11:09.586
don't like the same thing
that you like

11:09.586 --> 11:12.422
doesn't mean that it's weird
to be different.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.091
Okay, just because you don't
like this one popular thing

11:15.175 --> 11:18.053
does not mean
that you are weird.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.599
Yeah, yeah. I'm not sure
how it relates, but

11:22.599 --> 11:24.642
thank you, Gregory. Thank you.

11:24.726 --> 11:28.229
You know, all I wanted
was a place where,

11:28.313 --> 11:30.273
no matter
what was going on at home,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.400
they could enjoy themselves.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.652
And who cares
if that's with Ava?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.113
Now, you know I used
to date Allen Iverson.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.282
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

11:39.366 --> 11:41.576
He might've been The Answer,
but he was not the one.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.580
Clearly, we have
different styles.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.082
- Mm-hmm.
- But, you know, if Ava's committed,

11:47.082 --> 11:48.958
then that's really cool.
You know what?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.585
This is a good thing.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.546
Y'all make sure you stretch out.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.757
Forgot to have you sign
the liability waivers.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.426
Hey, Ava.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.387
Um, I just wanted to say

12:00.387 --> 12:03.723
I'm sorry for how I acted,
uh, earlier.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.602
I let my ego get in the way
of the step class, so...

12:07.686 --> 12:09.479
- You did do that, huh?
- Yes, I --

12:09.479 --> 12:11.356
You were like, "I'm Janine.
I like responsibility

12:11.356 --> 12:13.483
and structure
and weighted blankets."

12:13.483 --> 12:15.735
- The three pillars.
- You wanna see what we've been working on?

12:15.819 --> 12:17.320
Oh. Absolutely. Yeah.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.115
Ladies and Jeremiah,
get in formation.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.158
Beyoncé would be proud.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.827
5, 6, 7, and...

12:32.585 --> 12:33.670
Girl, this ain't time
for your solo.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.089
- Get out the line.
- Right. Right.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.095
Are you guys ready
for the step show?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.680
We are going to
blow your minds

12:43.680 --> 12:45.473
with the performance
Ava came up with.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.558
Ava?

12:46.558 --> 12:47.934
Yeah, I thought
you were in charge.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.687
Well, I'm trying to move away
from hierarchical leadership,

12:50.687 --> 12:52.355
but Ava is a great leader.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.523
Who'd have thought?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.025
I know, right?

12:55.025 --> 12:58.570
I mean, she did try to get the
kids into Akon's cryptocurrency,

12:58.570 --> 13:00.989
but she's been there
every day, so...

13:00.989 --> 13:02.907
Yeah, there's gotta be
some kind of catch.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.326
I mean, maybe it's just time
for you guys to admit

13:05.410 --> 13:06.870
that you misjudged Ava.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.913
Janine, do not
get your hopes up,

13:08.997 --> 13:11.249
because Ava will find a way
to bring them down.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.836
I don't think that's fair.
She's been doing the work.

13:14.836 --> 13:18.173
Maybe Ava has never
risen to expectations

13:18.173 --> 13:20.050
because nobody believed in her.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.510
- Nah.
- That's not it.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.054
- Yeah, that was a bit much.
- Mnh-mnh.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.431
But I'm telling you,
I believe in her.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.975
She's taking a...

13:29.059 --> 13:31.436
step in the right direction.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.984
Why is Gregory outside
in his car, eating?

13:38.068 --> 13:41.237
Oh, no.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.323
Ah, crap.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.368
Girlfriend.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.828
Is he doing sit-ups in there?

13:48.912 --> 13:52.082
Gregory, what are you
doing out here?!

13:52.082 --> 13:54.125
Is this about the pizza?!

13:54.209 --> 13:55.210
No.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.712
What is that?
What are you eating?

13:57.796 --> 13:59.005
Why don't you just leave me

13:59.089 --> 14:00.340
and my boiled-chicken
sandwich alone!

14:00.340 --> 14:03.218
Oh, boiled?! That's
the worst way to cook it, man!

14:03.218 --> 14:04.803
Oh, I'm sorry.
I could salt it --

14:04.803 --> 14:06.471
You know what? I don't have to
explain anything to y'all, okay?

14:06.471 --> 14:08.723
I'm a grown-ass man!

14:10.225 --> 14:14.270
Ooh, I think we broke that boy.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.855
This is gonna be good.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.109
Oh. Hey. Greg.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.238
- He didn't --
- Hey!

14:23.238 --> 14:26.032
Oh, my God.
I'm so happy you guys came!

14:26.116 --> 14:27.117
Oh, just a heads-up --

14:27.117 --> 14:28.451
Um, there are some parts
of the routine

14:28.535 --> 14:29.953
that are a little bit risqué,

14:29.953 --> 14:31.496
so when I give you the signal,
just go ahead and

14:31.496 --> 14:33.164
turn away -- turn away from it.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.249
Well, I'm excited.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.792
I've been waiting for this
my entire life.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.336
You know, I applied
to Morehouse, so...

14:38.420 --> 14:39.587
Where's Ava?

14:39.671 --> 14:41.589
Uh, Ava's just
probably somewhere

14:41.673 --> 14:43.258
working out those knees,
you know?

14:43.258 --> 14:45.135
She's the real star of the show.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.971
Wait until you guys see the work
that she put into this.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.764
- I'm just --
- Uh, Miss Teagues?

14:49.848 --> 14:51.099
- Yeah.
- Principal Coleman left.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.517
You're gonna have to lead us.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.519
What do you mean she left?

14:54.519 --> 14:57.939
She said that something came up
and that you'd handle it.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.775
Wha-- I can't handle it.
I barely know the routine.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.944
That's what I said.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.446
Ava will be Ava.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.448
Yeah, you
give her a chance,
she's gonna let you down.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.366
I'd make that bet
10 times out of 10.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.577
You want me
to buy you some time?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.120
- Yes.
- Abbott Elementary,

15:12.120 --> 15:13.705
- make some noise!
- Yeah.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.626
I'm gonna make this basketball disappear.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.339
Ta-da!

15:33.141 --> 15:35.226
Ava, where are you going?

15:35.310 --> 15:36.394
I'm busy right now, Janine.

15:36.478 --> 15:37.729
What, are you waiting
for an Uber Black

15:37.729 --> 15:39.522
to take you
to an Uzi Vert concert?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.191
You know that man don't come out
during the daytime.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.317
Go take care of your step class.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.235
I can't, because you
changed the routine.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.945
- Then do your wack-ass routine!
- You know what?

15:46.029 --> 15:47.822
Everybody told me
not to trust you.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.407
They said you'd do this.
And I said no,

15:49.491 --> 15:50.742
because I believed in you.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.077
And now it's messing
with the kids.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.621
You can't think of anyone
other than yourself.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.375
Oh, an airport van to take you
on another vacation?

16:03.213 --> 16:04.506
Baby?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.591
- Did you have to bring her here?
- She had an episode.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.385
We couldn't calm her down
and figured it would help her

16:08.385 --> 16:09.886
to see your face.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.429
I'm here now, Grandma.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.726
It's okay, Grandma. I'm here.

16:19.354 --> 16:20.355
- Whoa!
- Wow!

16:20.355 --> 16:21.856
Ohh.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.610
David Blaine ain't
got nothin' on me!

16:25.694 --> 16:26.820
How does he do it?

16:26.820 --> 16:30.198
- I mean...
- Hey, weird eater.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.783
Come over here.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.870
All right, listen.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.914
Is it bananas
you don't like food? Yes.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.417
Would it send my Nana Vincenze
into a fit of depression?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.085
- Absolutely.
- It's really bizarre.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.586
I've never seen
anything like it.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.130
- Is there a second part to this?
- Yeah.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.841
Everyone's got something
a little weird about them.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.759
She likes to sit
facing the door.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.137
Yeah, 'cause you don't ever
know what's gonna go down.

16:52.137 --> 16:55.557
And Jacob is, you know... Jacob.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.766
And we all know Barbara's --

16:56.850 --> 16:58.601
Doesn't have a weird
thing about her.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.229
Right. So the moral
of the story is,

17:01.229 --> 17:02.856
we're all weirdos here.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.400
Or the moral of the story

17:05.400 --> 17:08.236
is that, since we're all weird,
then none of us are.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.655
- No. 100%, we're weird.
- No. That's not how it works.

17:10.739 --> 17:11.865
- We're weird.
- Mnh-mnh.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.616
By the way, I would like
to be reimbursed

17:13.700 --> 17:15.535
for my excursion to Baltimore.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.245
I took toll roads.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.168
Janine, what are you doing here?

17:23.168 --> 17:24.252
Don't you have
a step performance

17:24.252 --> 17:26.046
you're supposed to
be preparing for?

17:26.046 --> 17:30.550
I just wanted to say sorry
for what I said back there.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.177
There's no need to apologize.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.678
No, no. I --

17:33.762 --> 17:35.764
Janine, why do you have to
make such a big moment

17:35.764 --> 17:38.141
out of these apologies?
You're wrong all the time.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.393
I wouldn't say all the time.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.900
Is your grandmother okay?

17:46.900 --> 17:48.151
Yeah, she'll be fine.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.195
She's been staying with me
for the past couple weeks,

17:50.195 --> 17:51.279
but we finally found someplace

17:51.363 --> 17:53.323
that could take care
of her full-time.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.200
She's just not used to it yet.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.284
Yeah.

17:56.368 --> 17:59.746
So that's what you were doing
while you were on vacation?

17:59.746 --> 18:02.082
Well, I did watch seven seasons
of <i>Survivor,</i>

18:02.082 --> 18:03.958
so it wasn't not a vacation.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.673
You know, the kids really love

18:09.673 --> 18:11.841
that routine
that you came up with.

18:12.634 --> 18:13.843
It was just something
we threw together.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.971
- The kids are doing the heavy lifting, so...
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.684
Well, if you want...

18:20.684 --> 18:22.686
we can still do the performance.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.313
Together.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.891
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

19:42.891 --> 19:44.142
Janine, you did okay.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.602
Ava, you know what?

19:45.602 --> 19:47.687
You really stepped...up.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.397
I can tell that you've been
waiting to say that all week.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.360
Thanks, Janine.
I appreciate you.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.903
Aw.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.322
Mnh!

19:57.322 --> 20:00.867
Janine, that performance
was on point!

20:00.867 --> 20:04.662
Oh! And they say UPenn students
can't step.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.664
- Wait. Who says that?
- So, wait.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.792
What was the drama
with Ava this time?

20:08.792 --> 20:10.919
Oh, you know, she just
had to take care of
some stuff real quick.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.921
She made it here for the kids.
She showed up

20:12.921 --> 20:14.923
- just like I said she would.
- Mm-hmm.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.216
I still say this ends up

20:16.216 --> 20:18.093
with you at the bottom
of a pyramid scheme,

20:18.093 --> 20:20.470
but, hey, that was fun.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.722
- I enjoyed it.
- Yeah. Yeah!

20:22.806 --> 20:23.807
Great job.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.767
- Thank you.
- That was better than Morehouse.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.772
It was a really good show.
Very good.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.607
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.944
Now I'm starving.
Do you wanna go get some pizza?

20:35.944 --> 20:37.987
Uh, yeah, uh, pizza
sounds delicious.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.114
Okay.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.199
Um, what was your favorite
part of the show?

20:41.199 --> 20:43.368
Oh, I would say
the "5, 6, 7, 8" portion

20:43.368 --> 20:45.453
where ever-- everybody got
really structured.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.530
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.118
Oh, oh, oh.
