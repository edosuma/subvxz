WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:04.971
Who are those people,

00:04.971 --> 00:06.272
and why do they keep taking
our picture?

00:06.272 --> 00:07.807
That's Rolling Stone,
and they're here today

00:07.807 --> 00:09.576
doing a feature
on Bottom Dollar.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.878
I didn't come here to write
about Bottom Dollar or Minx.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.446
I came here to write about you.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.329
There's a whisper campaign that
a good number of our readers

00:16.329 --> 00:18.752
- are homosexuals.
- Isn't it better

00:18.752 --> 00:20.587
if our work is interesting
to all kinds of people?

00:20.587 --> 00:22.555
We have advertisers
that are paying

00:22.555 --> 00:24.237
specifically to reach women.

00:24.237 --> 00:27.727
Tonight,
ladies choose their partners.

00:27.727 --> 00:30.630
Len, I was, um, thinking
about going back to Minx.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.799
Oh. It's about time.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.334
I would like you to consider it

00:34.334 --> 00:36.136
my application
to be your secretary.

00:36.136 --> 00:40.340
But I need you to come up
with more ideas for Minx.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.575
I've gotten everything
I've ever wanted,

00:42.575 --> 00:45.145
and it's happened so fast.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.813
Have you ever
considered that maybe

00:46.813 --> 00:49.015
you are exactly
where you belong?

01:38.431 --> 01:40.400
Oh.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.502
I can send up the concierge
if you would prefer.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.405
You do know that I have a thing
for a man with a comb-over.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.440
Did I tell you this?

01:48.508 --> 01:49.476
Come here.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.844
I am very late.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.378
I have back-to-back meetings.

01:52.378 --> 01:53.513
You're not gonna look
very professional

01:53.513 --> 01:54.981
without your knickers on,

01:56.850 --> 01:58.151
Just saying.
Do you want these back?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.255
Mm...

02:05.859 --> 02:08.394
We're shooting the album cover today.

02:08.394 --> 02:10.396
I could use your eye.

02:10.396 --> 02:12.532
If you want to add
another shoot to my schedule,

02:12.532 --> 02:15.768
then I am going to require
payment in advance.

02:15.768 --> 02:18.538
Oh. Well, that can be arranged.

02:18.538 --> 02:19.606
- All right.
- Yeah.

02:19.606 --> 02:20.773
You got five minutes.

02:20.773 --> 02:22.242
- Five minutes?
- Mm-hmm.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.476
Yeah, but what if I want

It's my personal best.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.680
I'm telling you,

03:00.680 --> 03:01.881
you gotta try
this jogging thing.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.050
You really do. This is the...

03:04.050 --> 03:05.285
well, it's the healthiest
I've ever felt

03:05.285 --> 03:06.319
in my whole life.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.320
Hey, boss.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.421
I covered your office windows

03:08.421 --> 03:09.756
so no one can sneak a peek of...

03:09.756 --> 03:11.925
...Secret Project X.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.726
Sorry, Rita. It's a secret.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.728
We know.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.096
- Doug?
- Mm?

03:17.096 --> 03:18.731
As your probationary secretary,

03:18.731 --> 03:20.633
can I ask you a question
about Secret Project X?

03:20.633 --> 03:21.868
You can ask me anything.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.003
Um,
does it have to be a secret?

03:24.003 --> 03:25.271
I mean, wouldn't it be more fun

03:25.271 --> 03:27.473
if people knew
what they were excited about?

03:27.473 --> 03:29.475
Well, it's about, you know,
keeping people guessing,

03:29.475 --> 03:30.944
so that's kind of the idea.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.779
Oh, but...

03:32.779 --> 03:33.913
they're not.

03:33.913 --> 03:37.483
Well, maybe not out loud,
Bambs, but...

03:37.483 --> 03:39.552
but inside, they are.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.853
I mean, look at them.

03:40.853 --> 03:43.323
They've got an itch
inside their brains,

03:43.323 --> 03:46.059
and they don't know
how to scratch it.

03:48.494 --> 03:50.797
But none of these people matter
anyhow, right?

03:50.797 --> 03:52.765
We've got an audience of one,

03:52.765 --> 03:55.134
and when Connie sees
what we are cooking up,

03:55.134 --> 03:56.469
we're gonna be writing
our own ticket.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.137
And then I'll officially be
your gal Friday?

03:58.137 --> 03:59.372
Absolutely--we pull this off,

03:59.372 --> 04:00.840
you're gonna get a raise
and benefits.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.475
Yes!

04:02.475 --> 04:05.211
Oh, but can I still do
my own dental?

04:05.211 --> 04:06.346
Yeah, whatever you want.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.451
I can't believe it's real!

04:11.451 --> 04:13.286
It just needs
Bella's signature.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.389
And also, you need to trim
about 100 words

04:16.389 --> 04:17.790
'cause I don't want
to mess with the design.

04:17.790 --> 04:18.791
Oh.

04:18.791 --> 04:19.926
Maybe lose the bit

04:19.926 --> 04:21.461
about Bella finding
the earring?

04:21.461 --> 04:23.229
What?
It's the soul of the piece.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.731
Ugh, you really are a writer.

04:24.731 --> 04:25.732
Yeah!

04:27.166 --> 04:29.135
Oh, it feels great to be back.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.270
I have missed this place.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.205
Aw. Well, we missed you too.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.506
A lot of people here care
about you,

04:33.506 --> 04:36.876
and you sort of disappeared
on us.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.712
Well, I--I needed to figure
some stuff out, you know?

04:39.712 --> 04:42.415
Mm. Like Bella?

04:42.415 --> 04:45.084
And her escapades seem to have
brought some stability.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.553
And adventure.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.956
Yeah, Bella's been
around the block now.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.958
Those San Marino blocks
are long and leafy.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.926
You don't know the half of it.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.762
But Bella started her journey

04:55.762 --> 04:57.764
through some other
neighborhoods too.

04:57.764 --> 05:02.068
Ones with more experimental architecture.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.836
Think she's tempted
to revisit those?

05:03.836 --> 05:07.674
Well, Bella is in
a--a better place

05:07.674 --> 05:10.243
with her husband, Gian-Paul,

05:10.243 --> 05:13.946
and uh, Bella needs to focus
on her work

05:13.946 --> 05:15.348
while at work

05:15.348 --> 05:17.784
and nothing else.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.285
Do you get what I'm saying?
I'm not good at this.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.620
No, I get it.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.588
♪ But I woke up this morning ♪

05:22.588 --> 05:23.956
♪ With that taste
In my mouth ♪

05:23.956 --> 05:26.292
- Oh, what's going on here?
- Oh, nothing.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.627
Just finishing up some stuff
for tonight.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.630
Oh, right.
Your secret special something.

05:30.630 --> 05:31.597
- What time is it again?
- Uh--

05:31.597 --> 05:32.899
Doors open at 8:00.

05:32.899 --> 05:35.468
Don't worry
if you can't make it.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.969
You work hard, you play hard.

05:36.969 --> 05:38.538
You deserve a quiet night in.

05:38.538 --> 05:39.639
No, I can spare 90 minutes.

05:39.639 --> 05:40.707
That's just an estimate.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.008
I didn't factor in
applause breaks.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.776
Okay, you mind heading in
and finishing up?

05:43.776 --> 05:45.278
Yeah. But all good, Prigger.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.512
I mean,
Connie's coming tonight,

05:46.512 --> 05:47.747
and those are really
the only eyes I need,

05:47.747 --> 05:48.981
so honestly,
don't worry about it.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.049
- Uh-uh.
- Okay.

05:50.049 --> 05:51.117
Okay.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.854
- Hey!
- Oh, hi! Mwah!

05:54.854 --> 05:58.324
Oh, both cheeks! That's new.

05:58.324 --> 05:59.392
Maybe I'll use that for Bella.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.393
- Oh, you should!
- Yeah.

06:00.393 --> 06:01.361
Listen, um, I'm just popping in.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.862
I'm gonna drop these off,

06:02.862 --> 06:04.230
and then I'm gonna go meet
Constance in Beverly Hills.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.398
Oh, excuse me.

06:05.398 --> 06:06.733
- Field trip with the boss?
- Mm-hmm.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.101
Somebody's making
an impression.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.302
I think she just wants
to give me notes

06:09.302 --> 06:10.336
on the August issue

06:10.336 --> 06:12.205
in her, you know,
natural habitat.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.273
But anyway,
it's so good that you're back.

06:14.273 --> 06:15.475
Oh, well, it feels great.

06:15.475 --> 06:16.843
Everything got so shiny.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.311
- I know.
- Right?

06:18.311 --> 06:20.179
Oh, did you look
at those revisions?

06:20.179 --> 06:21.614
No, not yet, but I will.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.082
I'm just--you know,
I'm swamped.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.684
There's just--
there's so much going on here,

06:24.684 --> 06:26.652
and--and I--
I'm trying to write my book,

06:26.652 --> 06:28.421
and I have the--the renovations
on the new condo--

06:28.421 --> 06:29.622
And?

06:29.622 --> 06:31.023
Plus crashing at the Margaux, yes,

06:31.023 --> 06:32.325
so I'm just getting no sleep.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.960
Now, is that the hotel's fault

06:33.960 --> 06:35.428
or your rock star boyfriend?

06:35.428 --> 06:37.597
He's not my boyfriend.
He is just--

06:37.597 --> 06:40.133
The famous musician
you're shacking up with.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.634
I cannot believe
this is my life

06:41.634 --> 06:43.536
and not some story
that I'm writing in my head.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.072
It's wild!
It's almost as wild as Bella.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.540
Where do you come up
with that stuff?

06:47.540 --> 06:48.674
Oh, well, actually--

06:48.674 --> 06:49.942
Does my hair look okay,
by the way?

06:49.942 --> 06:51.110
I did not have time
to wash it this morning

06:51.110 --> 06:52.578
because I was having sex.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.214
Yes, yes.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.551
It looks perfect.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.654
I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here, I'm here.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.389
Okay, I hope
you can uh, read my notes.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.658
They got a little bit smudged.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.593
Whiskey and, uh...

07:09.262 --> 07:10.196
...mint chip.

07:10.196 --> 07:11.230
What a Wednesday.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.432
Well, I learned from the best.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.968
Yes, you did.
Okay, I call it...

07:17.336 --> 07:18.771
...Good Clean Fun.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.072
Oh, your dream shoot.

07:20.072 --> 07:22.975
Okay, I am ready.
Tell me everything.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.311
A bathhouse, West Hollywood.

07:25.311 --> 07:26.913
More men that we know
what to do with.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.182
A bathhouse? Very sexy.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.349
Okay, what's the angle?

07:30.349 --> 07:31.384
Okay.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.085
Communal bathing.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.255
Men lounging, reading,
playing board games.

07:36.255 --> 07:38.057
It's an exploration
of the male form

07:38.057 --> 07:40.092
without artifice,
out in the wild.

07:42.261 --> 07:43.396
Huh.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.967
Do you think it might be
too, um...

07:49.535 --> 07:51.404
...straightforward for Minx?

07:51.404 --> 07:52.385
It's real.

07:52.385 --> 07:53.706
You know, actual male desire.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.374
Totally.

07:55.374 --> 07:56.409
Yeah.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.911
It's, uh, it's--
it's very, um...

08:02.081 --> 08:04.417
Maybe I can, um, think on it. Okay.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.619
Richie's been waiting weeks
to pitch this to you.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.954
We've already rescheduled twice.

08:07.954 --> 08:09.422
- We have to pull the trigger.
- Yeah.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.891
I just--I don't see how, um,

08:11.891 --> 08:14.460
this slots into
a women's magazine.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.929
What if, you know,
it's not in a bathhouse?

08:16.929 --> 08:18.231
What if it's the same,

08:18.231 --> 08:19.765
but just, you know,
somewhere else?

08:19.765 --> 08:20.933
Then it would be different.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.101
I think that
we should put a pin in it

08:22.101 --> 08:23.236
and we should think about

08:23.236 --> 08:25.972
something more aspirational, okay?

08:25.972 --> 08:27.573
Our centerfolds
are the ultimate fantasy.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.275
For our female readers.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.879
Sounds like
you have a very clear vision.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.227
Any fixes?

08:34.227 --> 08:35.548
Uh...

08:38.217 --> 08:39.418
...what about backstage?

08:39.418 --> 08:40.720
A-a stolen moment

08:40.720 --> 08:41.901
with a rock star
in his dressing room?

08:41.901 --> 08:43.723
Wow. Lightning strikes.

08:43.723 --> 08:44.857
How'd you come up
with that one?

08:45.992 --> 08:48.628
I guess I'll go find us
a rock star.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.467
Didn't your mama ever teach you
how to turn someone down?

08:54.467 --> 08:55.581
My mother? No.

08:55.581 --> 08:56.569
My mother...

08:58.304 --> 09:00.006
My mother wasn't around
for that kind of stuff.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.141
Not something
you want to talk about?

09:02.141 --> 09:03.242
No, not really.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.111
Well, my mama
is a serious bitch,

09:05.111 --> 09:06.345
and she taught me that

09:06.345 --> 09:08.080
if you don't like something,
you just say no.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.249
- Who says I didn't like it?
- You, in 40 ways.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.251
Body language, tone of voice,
even the way

09:12.251 --> 09:13.519
you keep scratching
the back of your head.

09:13.519 --> 09:14.620
Okay, I feel observed.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.922
You think it's nicer,

09:15.922 --> 09:17.823
but it only makes everything worse.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.659
Just be direct.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.941
By the way, I've looked over
your work expenses.

09:21.941 --> 09:22.942
Mm-hmm?

09:22.942 --> 09:24.997
14 valet stubs
from the Margaux.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.165
I'm living out of a suitcase.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.366
I--I--I need a place to work.

09:27.366 --> 09:28.801
You have an office.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.136
I'm not accepting these.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.337
- Yeah, but I'm staying--
- No.

09:32.705 --> 09:33.973
See how easy that was?

09:35.107 --> 09:36.242
Not a problem.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.710
Bella quivered

09:37.710 --> 09:39.812
as Gian-Paul shivered.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.348
Ooh, that's good.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.183
- Shel.
- Hi, Doug.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.451
Can I talk to you?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.621
That Bella LaRouche stuff
is sexy stuff.

09:48.621 --> 09:49.789
It really is.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.123
I didn't expect it
from a Prigger.

09:51.123 --> 09:52.825
Oh, well, I've always had
a wild imagination.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.694
Imagination--she's married
to an orthodontist

09:54.694 --> 09:55.895
from La Cañada.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.363
It's actually San Marino, so...

09:57.363 --> 09:59.565
Either way, I need a little bit
of that sexiness

09:59.565 --> 10:00.800
on my special project.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.535
My copy could use a spark.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.337
Well,
my spark doesn't come cheap.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.339
How's a hundred bucks
and a peek on the inside?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.406
I'm in.

10:10.409 --> 10:11.544
Shellfish!

10:11.544 --> 10:12.712
You're gonna be working
pretty closely

10:12.712 --> 10:14.046
- with Bambs on this one.
- You know what?

10:14.046 --> 10:15.915
I'm on a deadline, actually,
so I should just--

10:15.915 --> 10:18.517
Oh, come on.
It's an afternoon, and that's--

10:18.517 --> 10:20.720
Well, that's really
all the time we've got.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.555
So I'm gonna lock you two girls
in this room,

10:22.555 --> 10:24.190
and please make some magic.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.092
Magic's on hold.
We have a huge problem.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.594
The archdiocese said we can't
use their venue anymore.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.463
Oh, no.
I guess it's all falling apart.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.664
- I'll just get back to--
- No, no.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.032
Just a little speed bump.
It's a hiccup.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.000
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.034
I'm so sorry.

10:35.034 --> 10:36.035
You give me one thing to do,

10:36.035 --> 10:37.036
and I already screwed it up.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.337
Oh, Bambi, it's fine.

10:38.337 --> 10:39.538
I'll have a new venue by lunch.

10:39.538 --> 10:40.873
But here's
what I need you girls to do:

10:40.873 --> 10:42.742
just stay in this room
and grind it out

10:42.742 --> 10:44.510
until you make something great
together, okay?

10:44.510 --> 10:45.778
Please.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.358
Sorry, appointment only.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.726
She has one.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.898
- This is Betty, the designer.
- Hi.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.500
My latest discovery.

11:07.500 --> 11:12.038
An all-female staff
confronting the sartorial ennui

11:12.038 --> 11:13.839
of the working women's
wardrobe.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.841
Right. Uh...

11:15.841 --> 11:17.376
okay, well, while I agree

11:17.376 --> 11:20.212
that professional women do need
more clothing options,

11:20.212 --> 11:24.250
I wonder if uh, fashion coverage
is beyond the scope of--

11:24.250 --> 11:27.286
No, we're not here
for the magazine.

11:27.286 --> 11:30.589
We're actually here for you.

11:30.589 --> 11:31.590
I'll grab the second rack.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.325
A little wardrobe rethink.

11:33.325 --> 11:35.494
Multiple racks?

11:35.494 --> 11:37.463
Didn't realize my wardrobe
was so stale.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.131
Oh, you have beautiful style.
You do.

11:39.131 --> 11:42.702
It just needs to catch up
to the woman that you've become

11:42.702 --> 11:45.438
and the magazine that
you've elevated so beautifully.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.273
Okay.
That's very kind.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.108
Thank you, Constance,
but it's--

11:49.108 --> 11:50.810
I actually put a lot of thought
into what I wear.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.978
Right.

11:52.978 --> 11:57.083
Navy suits and pussy bows,
they got you here,

11:57.083 --> 11:59.618
but you do not need
to dress like a man

11:59.618 --> 12:01.454
to earn the respect of one.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.555
Mm-mm.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.256
Not anymore.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.359
Surely, there is something here
that catches your eye.

12:11.030 --> 12:11.964
Huh.

12:11.964 --> 12:15.468
What a figure!

12:15.468 --> 12:17.203
See, I had a feeling.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.337
Y--yeah.

12:18.337 --> 12:21.440
It feels like
a bit of a departure.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.510
No one at your level

12:24.510 --> 12:27.847
is claiming sexuality
and intelligence

12:27.847 --> 12:29.415
with equal confidence.

12:29.415 --> 12:33.686
We can be powerful
and feminine.

12:33.686 --> 12:37.356
Give our girls something
to aspire to.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.725
See, I had to make this all up
as I went along.

12:39.725 --> 12:43.863
And boy, do I have the scars
to prove it.

12:43.863 --> 12:47.399
Let me ease your path a little.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.903
I have loved having you
to look to.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.938
It's not something I'm used to.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.340
And I have really enjoyed

12:54.340 --> 12:57.643
having a smart younger woman
to fuss over.

12:59.178 --> 13:00.846
No one is gonna force you
to do something

13:00.846 --> 13:02.248
that you don't want to do.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.850
Ah.

13:04.850 --> 13:08.287
Why don't you wear this out,
see how you feel?

13:08.287 --> 13:11.624
If you don't like it,
we'll scrap the whole thing.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.761
You know what?

13:15.761 --> 13:17.797
I think we might have room
after all.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.266
Bring back one of those chunky
books for her to read.

13:21.233 --> 13:25.271
Hmm. I call it Backstage Ass.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.746
She's not dumb.
This can't be in the magazine.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.181
Honey, lift up your chin
a little bit.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.249
Less bored, more judgmental.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.286
You don't care how hard
he worked on that song.

13:40.286 --> 13:41.720
You're at 90% fuck you.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.923
You need to bring this thing
down to about ten.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.157
Only 90?

13:45.157 --> 13:46.926
Hey, Danny,
fly in that typewriter.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.594
She wants everyone to know
how busy she is.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.563
Oh, um,
typewriting costs extra.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.132
- Richie?
- Excuse me.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.567
What?

13:54.567 --> 13:56.468
We both know I should be
shooting Bathhouse right now.

13:56.468 --> 13:59.405
She's the boss, remember?

13:59.405 --> 14:01.207
Joyce and I used to have
a dialogue.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.342
Now it feels like a lecture.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.878
I understand your frustration.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.914
If you can't do this concept,
just scrap the shoot.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.850
We'll go with a retrospective.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.017
Easy.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.919
The magazine isn't even
a year old.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.421
That's creative bankruptcy.

14:15.421 --> 14:18.457
Telling your boss to go screw
herself is career suicide.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.892
Don't sweat it.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.261
I already pulled some goofy,
behind-the-scenes shots.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.897
- We can just--
- Stop hurting me.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.632
Okay.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.767
I'll figure it out.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.507
What?

14:35.507 --> 14:36.809
No, I swear.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.677
I thought I was done,
but she kept squealing,

14:38.677 --> 14:40.779
so I shoved both my hands
back inside

14:40.779 --> 14:42.047
and pulled out another piglet.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.329
Oh, my God.

14:43.329 --> 14:45.851
The things that happen to you
on the 405.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.753
Oh, I have missed
these stories.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.955
Oh, my God, and look how fast
the work went.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.123
Is there anything else?
Are we--

14:51.123 --> 14:53.292
- No, I think that's it.
- Okay.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.526
Should we have sex now?

14:54.526 --> 14:57.229
Oh, n--no. Uh, but--no.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.732
I--um, I--
I can't do that again.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.834
I just thought with you coming
back here, just--

15:01.834 --> 15:03.335
Yeah, well, I'm--

15:03.335 --> 15:07.006
Bambi, I'm back,
but we need to be friends.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.454
No more... you know.

15:08.454 --> 15:10.643
- Orgasms.
- Yes, that.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.312
Or any associated behaviors.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.713
That's okay.

15:14.713 --> 15:15.915
I love friends.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.016
Friends are the family
you choose,

15:17.016 --> 15:19.051
and you don't have sex
with family.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.552
Unless it's your stepsibling.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.655
And even then,
you have to keep it a secret

15:22.655 --> 15:24.390
because of
his political career.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.492
I just want you to be happy.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.727
Oh, I am. I'm very happy.

15:28.727 --> 15:29.828
Good.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.030
So am I.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.901
Beautiful, beautiful.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.504
Yeah, you've got
a lot of girls out there

15:38.504 --> 15:39.972
that'll wanna see this.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.308
That's nice. That's great.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.709
That's excellent.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.978
David, shoot more
toward the camera.

15:48.814 --> 15:52.251
Hey, Graham. Eyes over here.

15:52.251 --> 15:57.189
♪ She taught me to run ♪

15:58.223 --> 16:00.472
My day opened up.

16:01.760 --> 16:02.895
Let's get you in the shot.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.476
Hey, Andy, let's get her
in the shot.

16:04.476 --> 16:05.564
She already is.

16:05.564 --> 16:06.699
We're on the clock, hon'.
Budge up.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.033
Oh, yeah. Totally get it.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.868
Yes, um,
where do you want me to--

16:09.868 --> 16:11.770
Um, yeah,
you should go over there.

16:11.770 --> 16:15.407
Back there
in the gazebo, cabana thing.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.512
- Hi, I'm--
- Joyce Prigger.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.880
- Yeah, that's me.
- Fun.

16:21.880 --> 16:22.881
You writing a story?

16:22.881 --> 16:24.283
Uh, yeah.

16:24.283 --> 16:26.018
Yeah, I could be if there's,
you know, one to tell.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.219
You want any nuggets included?

16:27.219 --> 16:28.387
Just make it clear

16:28.387 --> 16:30.656
Carrie and Neil
are very happy together.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.758
- Mm-hmm.
- Groupies are always circling.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.059
Move quick if you want a drink.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.061
They devour everything.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.263
Well, you're just in time

16:38.263 --> 16:39.798
'cause we're all out.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.667
- There you go.
- Mm, thank you.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.606
Um, so...

16:47.606 --> 16:49.274
We're with Graham.

16:49.274 --> 16:51.210
He wanted our eyes on this.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.444
Did he?

16:52.444 --> 16:53.779
And how do you know Graham?

16:53.779 --> 16:55.080
I was at this party

16:55.080 --> 16:56.782
and got invited onstage
to play the shakers.

16:56.782 --> 16:57.983
You don't say?

16:57.983 --> 16:59.718
He told her that
she had the best rhythm

16:59.718 --> 17:01.920
- of any girl he'd ever met.
- Stop.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.055
Joyce, my minx,

17:03.055 --> 17:03.989
you want something
from the kitchen?

17:03.989 --> 17:04.990
We're putting in an order.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.392
- Um--
- Oh, my God.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.260
- You're the Minx lady?
- Mm-hmm.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.461
Oh, my God!

17:09.461 --> 17:11.196
My mom loves your magazine.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.098
Your mom? That is great.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.433
That's so--that's so great.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.169
We have a lot of older,
um, readers.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.047
Deal.

29:13.685 --> 29:14.953
You never said goodbye.

29:16.187 --> 29:18.323
I was told
not to interrupt the talent.

29:18.323 --> 29:19.824
I made a mistake.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.760
I wanted you there, it's just--
I don't know.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.096
Sometimes--sometimes
I get caught up.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.968
You're a star, Graham.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.736
And you should enjoy that.

29:31.736 --> 29:34.519
I plan on doing the same.

29:34.519 --> 29:35.807
Just not with you.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.542
Come on.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.477
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not.

29:41.212 --> 29:42.747
Look, we had a lot of fun,

29:42.747 --> 29:45.049
and you introduced me
to my new favorite hotel.

29:46.484 --> 29:48.987
All right. Okay.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.835
Yeah.

29:50.835 --> 29:51.856
Well, can we at least just--

29:51.856 --> 29:53.992
- Good night, Graham.
- Okay.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.710
If you change your mind...

29:58.710 --> 30:00.265
I'll be over here.

30:09.941 --> 30:11.322
