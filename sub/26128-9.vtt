WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:03.295
You missed another episode
of <i>Shameless,</i>

00:03.379 --> 00:04.672
and now we got to take
valuable time

00:04.755 --> 00:06.549
out of our show to tell you
what the hell you missed

00:06.632 --> 00:09.218
'cause you were too damn lazy
to get up off your fat asses

00:09.301 --> 00:10.720
and watch the damn TV.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.888
Why wouldn't you just tell me
that you're married?

00:12.972 --> 00:14.682
We stayed together
for the kid.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.726
Oh.

00:16.809 --> 00:19.562
Holy shit,
you're a fucking asshole.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.523
I'd like you to meet
our son, Santiago.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.234
He crossed the border
with his father and sister.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.611
They were looking for asylum,
but they got separated.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.988
We can't
keep this kid.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.407
Yes, we can.
He has an amazing arm.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.034
Kid brought the heat.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.161
All I ever wanted was
to be a mother.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.538
Frank, would you fertilize
my eggs?

00:37.621 --> 00:40.374
I would be honored to introduce
my little Frankies

00:40.458 --> 00:42.543
to your little Ingrids.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.086
<i>You think
our chances are good?</i>

00:44.170 --> 00:45.504
<i>I'm extremely optimistic.</i>

00:45.588 --> 00:46.881
<i>Thank you, Dr. Kwan.</i>

00:46.964 --> 00:48.591
Don't thank me. Thank Frank.

00:48.674 --> 00:50.051
Mm.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.635
I took care
of the bills, by the way.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.887
It cost 1,700 bucks.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.055
Damn.

00:54.138 --> 00:57.058
The squirrel fund is back.
Everyone needs to step up.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.477
<i>I've been giving Fiona money
for the bills.</i>

00:59.560 --> 01:00.853
<i>She just hasn't
been paying them.</i>

01:03.230 --> 01:04.356
Hey, Gallaghers.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.276
Shit.

01:07.359 --> 01:11.113

- Yeah, lately.

Ah.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.511
- We need our money back.
- What the fuck? What money?

03:39.595 --> 03:41.013
We've been giving you money
for utilities

03:41.096 --> 03:42.264
that have not
been getting paid.

03:42.348 --> 03:43.349
We need that money back.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.227
Fine.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.231
Jesus!

03:50.314 --> 03:52.066
The bills are under
my name now.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.026
That water you're using?
We're paying for that.

03:54.485 --> 03:55.569
So, until you repay us

03:55.653 --> 03:57.529
what we've been paying you
for the last three months,

03:57.613 --> 03:59.490
plus your share of rent
for the last three months,

03:59.573 --> 04:02.034
plus what it cost for me
to get shit turned back on,

04:02.117 --> 04:03.494
I don't really feel like
sharing my water with you.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.037
Yeah, I'll tell you what--

04:05.120 --> 04:06.997
you take everything
that I owe you

04:07.081 --> 04:08.666
from the last three months

04:08.749 --> 04:11.252
and subtract it from everything
that you owe me

04:11.335 --> 04:13.379
for the last 18 years.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.590
And when I've used all of
the water that I am entitled to

04:16.674 --> 04:19.301
some time in,
I don't know, 2048,

04:19.385 --> 04:21.804
then we can talk
about who's even.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.766
What are you wearing?

04:27.643 --> 04:29.103
Oh, Tami's mom
died of cancer,

04:29.186 --> 04:31.438
so her family does
a five-K thing every year.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.274
You look sort of ridiculous.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.402
Everybody looks ridiculous
in running shorts.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.654
Debbie!
Turn my water on!

04:38.737 --> 04:40.197
Hey, did you turn
the water off on her?

04:40.281 --> 04:41.532
- Yep.
- Deb, she carried us

04:41.615 --> 04:43.617
for years--
you can give her a break.

04:43.701 --> 04:47.621
Turn the water back on!

04:47.705 --> 04:49.665
Once you pay us
what you owe us.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.333
I'm gonna get it to you.
I just lost track--

04:51.417 --> 04:53.168
You owe Carl, Lip, and I $832--

04:54.670 --> 04:56.171
Stop. Guys!

04:56.255 --> 04:58.632
The door! Debbie!

04:58.716 --> 05:00.342
If you had the month I had, you
would have lost track, too.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.469
Ooh, my Irish
boyfriend left me.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.637
Stop it!

05:03.721 --> 05:06.765
Go take a flying fuck
on a rolling doughnut!

05:06.849 --> 05:08.392
- What?
- Go take a rolling fuck

05:08.475 --> 05:10.436
- on a flying doughnut!
- Hello?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.354
I come in peace.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.648
Oh, fuck, no.

05:14.732 --> 05:17.192
I just want my tools back.

05:18.694 --> 05:19.737
What tools?

05:20.195 --> 05:22.364
My carpenter tools.
They're missing.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.533
Well, why would
I know about that?

05:24.616 --> 05:25.826
Come on, Fiona.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.536
What, you think
I just wandered on to your site

05:27.619 --> 05:29.788
and picked them up
out of your truck or something?

05:29.872 --> 05:30.998
Maybe.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.458
Or maybe
I came into your house

05:32.541 --> 05:33.542
in the middle of the night

05:33.625 --> 05:35.336
and I watched you sleep
for an hour

05:35.419 --> 05:37.254
and then I just took them
on my way out.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.175
Do you have them or not?

05:41.258 --> 05:44.345
No.
You egotistical fuck!

05:44.428 --> 05:46.764
I haven't thought about you
in weeks!

05:46.847 --> 05:48.557
We thought
about you, though.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.731
- Guess I'll be going, then.
- Yeah.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.650
Damn straight you'll be going,
'cause next time,

05:58.734 --> 06:01.278
I won't stop them from
beating the shit out of you!

06:01.362 --> 06:02.905
If my tools happen to turn up,
let me know.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.406
That's how I make my living.

06:04.490 --> 06:07.368
Oh, if they "happen to"--
Fuck you!

06:14.333 --> 06:16.543
Thanks.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.837
Breakfast is on me
at Patsy's after I shower.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.005
Nope.

06:20.089 --> 06:22.508
No money, no shower.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.927
Oh, Christ.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.178
Where are you going?

06:26.261 --> 06:28.389
To shower at Veronica's.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.358
What are you doing here?

06:39.441 --> 06:40.943
I've been waiting
in the tent all night.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.277
But you should have been
working on your hardship essay

06:42.361 --> 06:44.530
- for West Point.
- I've had to jerk off twice.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.073
I can't write about that
to West Point.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.491
My dad found out
that I've been skipping

06:47.574 --> 06:48.951
softball camp
to hang out with you.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.536
He'll kill you
if he finds you here.

06:50.619 --> 06:53.664
He only has one working limb.
That doesn't scare me.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.087
It only takes one limb
to pull a trigger, son.

07:00.671 --> 07:01.672
Get inside.

Okay, pee now, 'cause you're
not gonna get another chance

07:06.385 --> 07:08.846
for, uh, about five kilometers.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.973
Hey, Brad,
let's try to finish

07:11.056 --> 07:12.724
ahead of Grandpa
this year, huh?

07:12.808 --> 07:14.393
Your family makes
me want to drink again.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.603
Boo-hoo-hoo.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.397
He's just busting your balls.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.316
Change your shirt already.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.901
We can just jog
this thing, right?

07:22.985 --> 07:24.111
Yeah.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.113

She seem a bit more
on edge than usual?

07:33.078 --> 07:34.496
This five-K brings up
a lot of memories

07:34.580 --> 07:36.665
of our mom's death.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.459
Tough day for all of us.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.588
So what's the deal
with you and my sister?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.048

07:45.132 --> 07:46.717

other people?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.595
I don't think we have a deal.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.473
Hey, back off, Cory.
He doesn't want the syph.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.183
All clean, Tami.

Mm.

- Wow.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.981

Hey, can you get this
into the register?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.113
Well, is it counted?

08:08.197 --> 08:09.239
Sure.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.158
You smell like a barroom floor.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.493
It's mouthwash. I just gargled.

08:12.576 --> 08:13.577
Manager's got to count it.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.078
I'm not gonna be
on the hook if it's short.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.122
You're the assistant manager.
You count it.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.874
- Fiona, I--
- Get off my ass!

08:22.085 --> 08:24.463
Sorry, sorry.
It's been a...

08:24.546 --> 08:26.757
It's been a morning.

get in the register.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.260

08:36.308 --> 08:38.185

08:38.268 --> 08:40.312
She's going through some stuff.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.611
Boone!

08:47.694 --> 08:50.447
Boone!

08:51.949 --> 08:54.409
Boone!

08:57.162 --> 08:58.872
Oh, you're so fucked.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.749
- Hey, man.
- Who the fuck's this guy?

09:00.832 --> 09:02.709
- That's Boone.
- Boone, I think.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.920
Thanks, fucknuts.
Who's Boone?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.422
Well, right now he's
the guy kissing your chick.

09:10.759 --> 09:14.263
Must be an amazing experience,
giving birth...

09:14.346 --> 09:17.266
feeling life violently ripping
its way out of you.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.809
Doesn't that sound exciting?

09:19.351 --> 09:21.937
Well, I've never thought of it
so graphically,

09:22.020 --> 09:24.773
but, yeah.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.984
Did you see all your other
children being born?

09:27.526 --> 09:29.027
Uh...

09:29.111 --> 09:30.571
uh, not a one.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.406
I came close on a few,
but, you know,

09:32.489 --> 09:33.949
scheduling conflicts.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.203
- How do you feel, Ingrid?
- Hey.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.248
Oh, super pregnant, Dr. Kwan.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.083
I put together a vision board--

09:43.166 --> 09:45.669
all these images
of healthy babies

09:45.752 --> 09:49.047
with loving parents
and puppies and joy.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.508
And then I stared
at it all night.

09:51.592 --> 09:55.554
I am telling you,
I feel all that in my uterus.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.264
I'm pregnant.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.641
Let's see what we've got.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.687
Oh.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.689
- Congratulations, guys.
- Oh, boy.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.149
You're gonna be parents.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.484
- I knew it! I knew it!
- You knew it!

10:09.568 --> 10:11.278
- Oh, oh!
- You knew, didn't you?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.446
- You knew.
- Oh, I did, and I couldn't

10:12.529 --> 10:13.739
have done it
without you, Frankie.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.074
Well, with my superior
genetics, why would you try?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.661
- Uh, hold on a second.
- Why? What?

10:19.745 --> 10:21.288
- What's going on?
- Oops.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.290
"Oops"?
What-what's "oops"?

10:23.373 --> 10:26.460
Well, it looks like six of them
have hunkered down in there.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.795
- Six of what--babies?
- Oh, my.

10:28.879 --> 10:29.963
Uh, embryos.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.299
I don't usually place
all the fertilized embryos

10:32.382 --> 10:34.217
in at once,
but at your advanced age,

10:34.301 --> 10:36.678
most women's uteruses
aren't as...

10:36.762 --> 10:38.513
accommodating.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.224
We're gonna have
to terminate a few of them.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.684
- Five?
- What?

10:42.768 --> 10:43.894
It's a safety issue.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.896
Carrying six embryos to term

10:45.979 --> 10:47.856
poses a major health risk
to the mother.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.067
W-what kind of health risk?

10:50.150 --> 10:53.236
Uh, months of bed rest,
possible death.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.655
You know what?

10:54.738 --> 10:56.823
Let's just--
let's just keep one.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.909
Uh, it's the safest route,
I think.

10:58.992 --> 10:59.993
Right, Doc?

11:00.577 --> 11:03.246
What, and--and kill
five of my babies?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.082
Now, embryos.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.669
Ingy, we want as m-many little
Frankies and Ingys

11:08.752 --> 11:11.213
running around as possible--
that's obvious.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.382
But do you really think
we can afford more than one?

11:13.965 --> 11:16.468
Not on my income,
but you'll get a job.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.972
We'll keep five.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.891
You can safely keep three.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.855
Okay, then...four.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.440
I will lose my medical license

11:30.524 --> 11:32.776
if I let you keep
any more than three.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.117
We'll do three.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.285
Great.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.704
We'll schedule the reduction
at the front desk

11:43.787 --> 11:44.955
on your way out.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.790
- Wow.
- Three.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.710
- Wow.
- Three babies!

11:49.793 --> 11:51.503
Wow.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.382
<i>Are you saying our
biggest client is asking us</i>

11:55.465 --> 11:57.050
to sell something
that is undrinkable?

11:57.134 --> 11:59.886
Yeah, we're in
advertising. That's what we do.

11:59.970 --> 12:00.971
Dax?

12:01.054 --> 12:03.807
Globally, three groups
tested semi-positively

12:03.890 --> 12:04.891
in taste tests--

12:04.975 --> 12:06.601
uh, Siberians,
the Dalit caste of India,

12:06.685 --> 12:08.478
and the American hobo.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.401
You mean...
literal homeless people.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.361
Well, general indigents.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.364
these were all
taken on the South Side.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.992
Homeless people,
hookers, transients.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.243
Bachman's not
going to turn a profit

12:23.326 --> 12:25.537
- selling to those people.
- No, no, no.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.956
But-but if we use them
as influencers,

12:28.039 --> 12:30.584
we can crack the Millennial
market wide open.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.627
They identify as poor

12:32.711 --> 12:34.963
or as victims of a society
that doesn't care about them.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.631
Thing is,
they're not poor.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.217
They just don't have the money
they think they're entitled to,

12:39.301 --> 12:40.886
and we think we can capitalize

12:40.969 --> 12:42.971
on their complete lack
of perspective.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.348
They're self-proclaimed hobos.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.684
We're simply offering them
the chance to prove it.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.606
"Hobo Loco"?

12:52.689 --> 12:55.150
Bachman Alcohol rebranded

12:55.233 --> 12:57.527
as the nectar
of the bona fide hobo.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.990
I don't hate it.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.074
We need
to build our campaign

13:03.158 --> 13:04.826
around the search
of a spokesperson.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.162
No advertisements,
no media bias,

13:07.245 --> 13:09.581
just Millennial word of mouth.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.999
Authenticity is key.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.460
The "hoboiest" of all hobos...

13:13.543 --> 13:15.629
the Hobo Loco Man.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.925
"Hobo Loco Man."

13:26.765 --> 13:28.767
Hey, where'd you get this kid?
Can I have him?

13:28.850 --> 13:30.936
Back off. He's our kid.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.604
Hey, George.
What we got?

13:32.687 --> 13:34.147
Uh, the usual.
Plus...

13:34.815 --> 13:36.441
Bachman's sending over
complimentary cases

13:36.525 --> 13:38.860
of this stuff for bars to test.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.737
"Hobo Loco"?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.656
It's deadly.
Sampled some in the truck.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.032
Had to take a watery shit
in the alley,

13:44.115 --> 13:45.367
it tore through me so fast.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.701
They're running a contest
to see

13:46.785 --> 13:48.078
if anybody can create
cocktails with it

13:48.161 --> 13:49.538
- to mask the taste.
- Oh.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.997
Winning bar gets
social-media exposure

13:51.081 --> 13:53.542
during the Hobo Loco Man
contest.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.710
Flyers for it are in the box.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.546
- See yous.
- See you.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.092
We're going to Indiana, Kevin.
It's the right thing to do.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.969
Why are you trying to take
my kid away from me?

14:04.052 --> 14:07.556
Reuniting Santiago with
his real family was your idea.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.600
Well, I hadn't seen his
knuckleball when I said that.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.228
They were gonna go live
with his uncle in Indiana

14:13.311 --> 14:15.856
before they were detained
by the government and split up.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.691
We go to Gary, find the uncle.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.859
How are we gonna find

14:18.942 --> 14:21.528
some random Guatemalan guy
in Gary, Indiana?

14:21.611 --> 14:22.696
I did a web search--

14:22.779 --> 14:25.365
"where to find illegal
immigrants, Gary, Indiana."

14:25.448 --> 14:26.700
Got a whole list of places.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.994
We don't even know
what he looks like!

14:38.628 --> 14:39.880
On the back.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.134
"Papa 'Y' Tío Jose."

14:45.594 --> 14:46.928
Where'd you get this?

14:47.012 --> 14:49.222
I may have gone through
Santiago's stuff

14:49.306 --> 14:51.099
- while he was sleeping.
- Aw, V.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.810
Moms are supposed to go
through their son's stuff--

14:53.894 --> 14:55.687
get rid of their porn and weed.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.231
Hear that?
You're already doing mom shit.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.649
You want to keep him, right?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.109
Kev.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.448
All right, fine.
We'll go to Gary.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.953
Oh! Lord, Jesus!

15:13.330 --> 15:15.165
Didn't think you were
gonna make it, son.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.708
I didn't either, sir.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.501
Caught a break with
an Air Force transport

15:18.585 --> 15:19.836
out of Okinawa,

15:19.920 --> 15:21.796
then hopped
a commercial from Seattle.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.007
Good God.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.092
- Wow.
- Mmm, mmm.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.263
Hey, Lip, you know Boone's
a war hero, right?

15:30.347 --> 15:31.598
Pulled three towelheads

15:31.681 --> 15:33.141
out of a burning building
in Mosul.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.643
Just one.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.353
Oh, you couldn't grab
the other two?

15:37.312 --> 15:38.980
Buried bullets
in the other two.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.941
They were ISIS, so he shot 'em.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.609
Got a medal for haji-murdering.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.653
Want to choke on his dick
right here, Cory?

15:44.736 --> 15:47.280
You can't have everybody,
you selfish bitch.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.825
Who are you?

15:50.909 --> 15:52.369
Lip. And you are...

15:52.452 --> 15:54.162
- Boone!
- Boone, right.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.581
Boone's Tami's
boyfriend.

15:56.665 --> 15:57.874
Was.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.125
A long time ago.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.461
Ah, it wasn't that long ago.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.255
Whatever. You know you two
are gonna get married.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.715
Okay, troops!

16:05.799 --> 16:08.510
Let's pay our tab
and run for cancer.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.556
Hey, man.
You know about this guy?

16:13.640 --> 16:14.849
If I say yes, am I in trouble?

16:14.933 --> 16:16.643
- Yes.
- Then, no.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.773
The bar that creates
the best new cocktail

16:21.856 --> 16:24.526
gets to be mentioned in
the Hobo Loco Man competition.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.610
"Hobo Loco Man"?

16:25.694 --> 16:27.237
I didn't make the name up,
Kermit.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.239
It's some advertising bullshit.
I don't know.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.408
- But it sounds cool.
- All right, thanks.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.368
Hazel is on her way,

16:33.451 --> 16:35.870
and Debbie said
she'll watch Santiago, so...

16:35.954 --> 16:37.205
Why don't you bring him with?

16:37.288 --> 16:38.790
Tell him you're looking
for his uncle?

16:38.873 --> 16:40.208
We don't want
to get his hopes up.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.501
Hey, Santiago?

16:41.584 --> 16:43.169
Buddy, you don't
have to do that.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.464
No. No, no, no--

16:46.548 --> 16:49.134
<i>no n-necesito...</i>

16:49.217 --> 16:51.219
Shit, I really got to learn
some Spanish.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.679
All right.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.390
So here what we got
is the Hoborita.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.726
It's a teaspoon of Hobo Loco,
shit-ton of lime juice,

16:57.809 --> 16:59.519
and some margarita mix.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.646
This is the Napalm Gut Rinse.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.023
Half a shot of Hobo Loco

17:03.106 --> 17:04.774
and a cup and a half
of cranberry juice.

17:04.858 --> 17:08.194
And here, what I just made...

17:08.278 --> 17:09.863
a full shot of Hobo Loco

17:09.946 --> 17:13.116
and four ounces...
of Baileys.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.492
What do you call that?

17:14.576 --> 17:15.660
Death.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.037
Bottoms up.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.582
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.459
Motherfucker!

17:22.542 --> 17:23.543
I can feel it in my eyeballs.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.253
- Okay.
- Hey, a round

17:25.336 --> 17:28.840
of your best stuff
for everybody, Kev-o!

17:28.923 --> 17:30.633
Ingrid and I are pregnant.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.718
- Oh!
- No way!

17:31.801 --> 17:33.386
Yeah.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.596
- Here, try that.
- It's true. Thank you so much.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.556
And not only that...

17:37.682 --> 17:40.560
We are gonna...

17:40.643 --> 17:42.854
We are having a, uh--
That's really good.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.689
Can I get...
...another one of those?

17:44.773 --> 17:47.484
We are having a baby shower,
and you're all invited.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.902
- When?
- Now!

17:48.985 --> 17:51.446
Here. No gifts.
We'll take money.

17:51.529 --> 17:55.033
And our three unborn children
thank you in advance.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.034
Triplets?

17:56.117 --> 17:57.160
Sextuplets.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.703
Holy shit,
is that, like, seven?

17:58.787 --> 18:00.663
- Six.
- No, no, no, no, no.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.499
No, you told Dr. Kwan three.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.583
I know what I said,
but I know what I want.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.293
But what I'm saying is
that, uh, a verbal contract...

18:05.376 --> 18:07.128
It is my body,
my choice, Frank!

18:07.212 --> 18:08.588
- ...in the state of Ill--
- I am not gonna kill

18:08.671 --> 18:10.006
- my babies.
- Okay. Okay.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.257
- We're gonna have all six!
- Okay.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.176
Six. Six!

18:13.259 --> 18:15.220
Okay. It's okay.
Everything's okay.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.180
- Yeah?
- Okay.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.557
- It's all good. Yeah.
- Six!

18:19.641 --> 18:22.393
That's great, isn't it?

18:22.477 --> 18:24.062
Ooh.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.438
I can feel them now.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.565
- You okay?
- Yeah.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.443
Yo.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.779
Those are some pretty short
shorts you got there.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.322
Yeah, if the wind blows
just right,

18:34.405 --> 18:36.741
- you can see up the lining.
- Hot.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.245
So you're getting married.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.831
I haven't decided yet.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.128
Our moms were best friends.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.213
We were dating
when my mom got sick,

18:50.296 --> 18:52.507
and she made him promise
to take care of me

18:52.590 --> 18:54.217
on her deathbed.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.594
She was pretty loopy with
all the pain meds at the end,

18:56.678 --> 19:00.682
but...now Boone thinks that
means we have to get married.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.100
He's a traditional guy,
you know,

19:02.183 --> 19:04.727
?
like, "a promise is a promise
and all that.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.564
All right!
Let's run this thing, huh?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.065
You gonna run in those?

19:10.191 --> 19:11.192
Yeah, why not?

19:11.276 --> 19:13.069
That's what we ran in
for Rangers training.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.612
He'll still win
the thing.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.031
Boone's won this five-K
every time he's run it.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.116
I don't know.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.826
My man Lip's
been running a lot.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.327
Oh,
you guys should race.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.745
Winner gets to fuck me.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.914
Loser should have
to fuck her.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.292
Well, then loser buys us
beers at the Alibi.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.835
- They're alcoholics, Cory.
- Christ, Cory.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.795
Cokes, then.
Unclench your vaginas.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.714
Come on.
It'll be fun.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.090
All right.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.467
I'll go slow.
I'll even wear my duffel.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.345
Sure.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.722
All right.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.850
Boone, you're with me
in the van.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.269
Whoo-hoo! Watch your step.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.854
Hey, this isn't
a piss-on-your-tree

19:47.937 --> 19:48.938
type of thing, right?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.148
'Cause I'm nobody's tree.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.357
I can beat him.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.026
Uh-huh.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.861
Sure.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.202
Ahh.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.916
It's vodka.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.918
<i>Next stop
with transfer available</i>

20:10.001 --> 20:12.545
<i>for the brown, purple,
and blue lines.</i>

20:12.629 --> 20:14.756
<i>Next stop
with transfer available</i>

20:14.839 --> 20:17.508
<i>for the brown, purple,
and blue lines.</i>

20:29.854 --> 20:31.564
Hey, excuse me, sir?

20:31.648 --> 20:33.775
Would you mind giving up
your seat for this lady?

20:34.442 --> 20:36.361
<i>No habla</i> English.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.446
Dude. Dude.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.490
You "hablos" <i>inglés</i>
just fine.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.826
She's pregnant and disabled,
so get your fucking ass up.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.036
<i>- Lo siento.</i>
- Okay,

20:45.119 --> 20:46.579
<i>Io siento</i> get the fuck up.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.459
There. Have a seat.

20:51.542 --> 20:55.463
Thanks, but I'm all right.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.548
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.094
Okay, fine.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.099
Fuck you.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.434
You could've gotten up, too.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.692
This is depressing.
Can I please play video games?

21:15.775 --> 21:19.153
No unnecessary electricity
usage between ten and four.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.780
That's not even peak hours.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.324
Hey, Debs.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.827
- Thank you for watching him.
- No problem.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.036
That'll just be
an eight-dollar flat fee

21:27.120 --> 21:28.413
- for facilities usage.
- What?

21:28.496 --> 21:29.872
- Since when?
- I take cash

21:29.956 --> 21:32.625
or a personal check with
a ten percent processing fee.

21:32.709 --> 21:33.960
Well, how about that

21:34.043 --> 21:35.920
minus a two-dollar
immigrant labor fee,

21:36.004 --> 21:37.005
since he's gonna clean
your house

21:37.088 --> 21:38.965
whether you want him to or not?

21:39.424 --> 21:41.259
Deal.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.095
Hey, listen, Santiago.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.891
I know you can't understand
anything I'm saying to you,

21:48.975 --> 21:51.269
so I feel comfortable
saying this.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.521
We're gonna go look
for your real family.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.023
Not that we're not
your real family,

21:55.106 --> 21:58.109
but we're gonna look
for your <i>real</i> real--

21:58.192 --> 21:59.360
I can't. I-it's too hard.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.737
- It's too much.
- Come on, come on.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.280
See you.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.745
Liam.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.914
Your share of the bills
this month--$70.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.583
I don't have $70.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.418
Then make $70.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.253
- I'm nine.
- Carl and I ran

22:17.337 --> 22:19.005
a day-care center
when he was nine.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.089
Figure it out.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.581
Carl.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.209
Your share of the bill
this month is $70.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.543
I thought I already gave
you all my money

22:57.627 --> 22:59.629
to turn the water
and electricity back on.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.798
I thought you were making money
charging those scooters.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.633
Yeah, that's until the hipsters
on the corner

23:03.716 --> 23:05.676
unplugged my extension cord,
which is weird,

23:05.760 --> 23:06.761
'cause I thought
that was

23:06.844 --> 23:08.846
the number-one transportation
for hipsters.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.223
Maybe you should get a real job

23:10.306 --> 23:12.016
and stop hanging out
with your girlfriend so much.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.352
Even if I wanted to,
I can't see Kelly anymore.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.478
What happened?

23:15.561 --> 23:17.230
Apparently I'm bad for her,
her dad says.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.981
Ever since we started
going out,

23:19.065 --> 23:20.274
her 20-mile run time
has gone up,

23:20.358 --> 23:22.193
upper-body strength
has gone to shit.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.320
You know, I don't want to screw
up her shot at Annapolis.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.280
That's weirdly
unselfish of you.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.199
Yeah, plus, her dad said
every gun he owns

23:28.282 --> 23:29.951
has a bullet
with my name on it.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.620
Hey, Kelly.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.122
Hey!

23:35.248 --> 23:36.666
What are you doing here?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.709
Just ran my 20 miles.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.169
Well, jogged 'em, really.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.713
Who the fuck wants
to run in this heat? Ah!

23:42.797 --> 23:44.841
I don't think we're supposed
to see each other.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.718
"Supposed to" isn't
a thing I'm doing anymore.

23:47.802 --> 23:50.471
Oh, Fritos.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.476
All I've ever wanted
is to have kids.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.271
What if none of these six
embryos make it to term?

23:58.354 --> 24:00.565
- Mm-hmm.
- Or what if only three

24:00.648 --> 24:03.401
of the eggs are good and those
are the three I got rid of?

24:03.484 --> 24:05.403
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, and if I miscarry,

24:05.486 --> 24:06.571
uh, that's it.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.156
That's my chance
to have children.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.700
And I'll have no more
frozen eggs to try again.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.703
But what if you carry
all six to term

24:13.786 --> 24:16.998
and we end up with six kids?

24:17.081 --> 24:19.125
Wouldn't that be great?

24:20.710 --> 24:22.670
Dr. Kwan. Hi, it's Ingrid.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.214
Yeah, I-I-I want to cancel
my reduction.

24:25.298 --> 24:28.092
- We're keeping all six.
<i>- The hell you are!</i>

24:28.176 --> 24:29.594
<i>I am not losing
my medical license</i>

24:29.677 --> 24:31.220
<i>- over six white babies...</i>
- Jesus.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.930
<i>...and their psycho mother.</i>

24:33.014 --> 24:34.682
I think we're gonna need
someplace to hide.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.517
<i>I will find you and vacuum--</i>

24:36.601 --> 24:39.103
And he was like,
<i>No "hablos" inglés.</i>

24:39.187 --> 24:42.106
Sorry, you don't have
to <i>"hablos" inglés</i>

24:42.190 --> 24:44.984
t-to see that a pregnant woman
on crutches

24:45.067 --> 24:46.861
- needs a seat.
- Yeah.

24:46.944 --> 24:47.945
You would think.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.031
Eliza, call the police.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.199
I'm on a completion deadline,

24:51.282 --> 24:52.617
so I don't have time
to fuck around, Fiona.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.285
Just tell me how much
you want for the tools.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.997
- I don't have them.
- Five hundred.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.957
- A thousand.
- Fuck off.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.918
I'll give you $1,500 if you
give them to me right now.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.586
I know you could use the money.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.054
- I don't need...
- Fiona, come on!

25:13.137 --> 25:14.597
- ...your money!
- Little help, please?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.265
Get out of here, Ford.
Get her some water.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.350
I don't need anything from you!

25:17.433 --> 25:19.268
- Hey.
- I want my tools, Fiona.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.811
- Yeah?
- I want them.

25:20.895 --> 25:22.104
Hey, you just got
your cast off.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.189
- How about some free coffee...
- Fuck!

25:23.272 --> 25:24.440
...for any customers
who felt that

25:24.524 --> 25:26.359
their safety was compromised?

25:26.442 --> 25:28.528
So sorry about that,
everyone.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.696
- So sorry.
- I can't fucking believe--

25:30.780 --> 25:31.781
Oh, excuse me.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.783
No. Did you just fucking
touch my ass?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.076
- Whoa, whoa!
- Hey, Fiona!

25:35.159 --> 25:36.827
- Come on! Fiona!
- I fucking felt you!

25:36.911 --> 25:38.287
- I felt you do it!
- Allan, please! Fuck!

25:38.371 --> 25:39.789
- Let's go!
- Fiona, come on.

25:39.872 --> 25:40.873
- Let's go.
- What is wrong with you?

25:40.957 --> 25:43.501
Get off of me! Stop!
You cannot touch people!

25:43.584 --> 25:45.086
Li-Lilli?
How about if we get this guy

25:45.169 --> 25:47.296
a couple of free burgers
if he promises not to sue?

25:47.380 --> 25:49.131
I'm so sorry.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.716
So sorry, you guys.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.510
It's all good.
Enjoy your meals.

25:52.593 --> 25:53.803
It's all good.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.096
Sit down.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.684
Sit down!

26:01.018 --> 26:03.646
Drink this
and calm the fuck down.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.111
Do you know what I did
when I found Roger

26:10.194 --> 26:11.654
in bed with my sister?

26:11.737 --> 26:13.447
I started boxing.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.116
Look, I'm doing a class
after our shift today.

26:15.199 --> 26:16.200
Why don't you come with me

26:16.284 --> 26:19.036
and find a safer place
for this aggression?

26:38.139 --> 26:39.932
Any of them look like
Uncle Jose?

26:40.016 --> 26:42.810
All of them look like him.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.186
No, no, no.
Uh, um...

26:44.270 --> 26:47.773
<i>N-n-necessito,</i> um...

26:47.857 --> 26:50.276
Are any of you Jose Gomez?

26:50.359 --> 26:52.987
- <i>Sí, sí, sí.</i>
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.989
Uh, do any of you Joses
have a nephew

26:55.072 --> 26:56.365
named Santiago?

26:56.449 --> 26:57.617
<i>Sí.</i>

26:58.909 --> 27:00.661
Are any of you Joses illegal?

27:42.495 --> 27:43.496
<i>Get your ass home</i>

27:43.579 --> 27:45.790
<i>right now, young lady, or
I'm taking your truck keys--</i>

27:45.873 --> 27:47.124
What are you doing?

27:47.208 --> 27:48.834
Making this house
cost-efficient.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.379
Adding insulation to the attic,
welding leaking pipes,

27:51.462 --> 27:53.214
adding timers
to light switches.

27:53.297 --> 27:54.882
<i>Where are you?</i>

27:54.965 --> 27:57.718
No, I'm not at Carl's.

27:57.802 --> 27:58.803
<i>Then where are you,</i>

27:58.886 --> 27:59.887
<i>and when are you coming home?</i>

27:59.970 --> 28:01.430
My whereabouts
are confidential.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.723
<i>Not from
your father, they're not.</i>

28:02.807 --> 28:05.267
I'll let you know when the
information gets declassified.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.728
<i>That's it. That's the last--</i>

28:07.812 --> 28:09.355
God, if I knew
pissing off my dad

28:09.438 --> 28:12.858
would be this much fun,
I would've started years ago.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.694
Um...

28:14.777 --> 28:17.488
I don't think we should be
seeing each other anymore.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.367
- Um, why?
- Uh, because...

28:22.034 --> 28:24.412
you're not...hot enough.

28:27.665 --> 28:28.999
- Right.
- For you?

28:29.083 --> 28:31.669
Mm...

28:31.752 --> 28:32.753
Hello, sir?

28:32.837 --> 28:33.879
<i>We had a deal, Gallagher.</i>

28:33.963 --> 28:36.298
Uh, now's really
not a good time. Uh--

28:36.382 --> 28:39.135
Sorry, Carl Gallagher's phone
is out of service.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.679
He'll call you back never.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.389
What the fuck?
Why you always got to be

28:43.472 --> 28:44.473
throwing my phone like that?

28:44.557 --> 28:46.517
- Ow, ow, ow!
- What did he offer you?

28:46.600 --> 28:47.685
- Nothing.
- Bullshit!

28:47.768 --> 28:49.979
- A spot at West Point?
- No.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.857
We--then why are you
breaking up with me?

28:53.482 --> 28:55.317
I don't want to mess
your future up.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.569
Your run times have been up,

28:56.652 --> 28:57.778
your test scores
have been down

28:57.862 --> 28:59.280
ever since you met me.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.614
I don't want to screw up
your shot to Annapolis.

29:00.698 --> 29:03.075
What if I don't want to go
to Annapolis?

29:03.159 --> 29:04.785
What if I'm sick
of working so hard?

29:04.869 --> 29:07.455
What if...I just want to stay
here and eat Fritos

29:07.538 --> 29:08.581
with your family and watch TV

29:08.664 --> 29:10.458
and enjoy life for once?

29:10.541 --> 29:13.169
Getting your ass kicked
by a girl again, Carl?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.754
Why are you walking like that?

29:14.837 --> 29:16.589
Just beat a superhero
in a five-K.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.090
What?

29:18.174 --> 29:20.885
He was wearing a 60-pound
duffel and combat boots, so...

29:20.968 --> 29:23.387
I'm not sure
it was that impressive.

29:23.471 --> 29:24.764
Hey.
You got our money?

29:24.847 --> 29:26.140
Hey.

29:26.223 --> 29:29.685
Yeah, here.
Some cash from today.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.604
- Uh, Fiona, you still owe us--
- I'll get it.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.647
Calm down.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.524
We're pregnant,
and we're hiding

29:35.608 --> 29:37.902
from a North Korean
fertility specialist,

29:37.985 --> 29:41.113
so make room,
my practice family.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.656
We are moving in.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.492
I'm sorry, y-you're what, now?

29:44.575 --> 29:45.868
We're hiding
from a North Korean

29:45.951 --> 29:47.203
fertility specialist.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.871
- No...
- You're pregnant?

29:48.954 --> 29:51.290
- Correct!
- With six kids!

29:51.373 --> 29:54.001
- Yay.
- Oh, that's hysterical.

29:55.252 --> 29:56.879
W-why is that funny?

29:56.962 --> 29:59.799
Oh, uh, how are you gonna
support them?

29:59.882 --> 30:02.468
Hold on, you're saying
I can't support six kids?

30:02.551 --> 30:04.011
- No.
- Absolutely not.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.347
I supported the six of you
the first time.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.390
You didn't support
one of us the first time.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.769
If I didn't support you,
how did you turn out so well?

30:11.852 --> 30:13.771
Bankrupt with anger issues?

30:13.854 --> 30:15.606
Recovering alcoholic.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.566
Sexually confused teen mom.

30:17.650 --> 30:18.901
Military psychopath.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.278
And let's not forget
about the arsonist felon.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.823
Okay, but Liam
is turning out okay.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.616
Liam woke up
the other night screaming,

30:25.699 --> 30:27.034
"Don't leave me with Frank!"

30:27.117 --> 30:29.411
Well, you're alive.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.706
Do you know how many parents
murder their children?

30:32.790 --> 30:36.418
But you all have blossomed
into massively flawed humans

30:36.502 --> 30:39.171
because I allowed you.

30:41.090 --> 30:43.425
You--you make yourself
at home, Ingrid.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.344
Oh, where are you going?

30:45.427 --> 30:49.598
To prove this sorry lot
of spilled seed wrong.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.645
You all should be ashamed

30:54.728 --> 30:56.689
for talking
to your father that way.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.650
But could you get me
some scissors...

30:59.733 --> 31:02.027
glue, a-and some magazines?

31:02.111 --> 31:04.697
I'd like to begin
my vision board.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.408
Oh, safety scissors.
Nothing too sharp.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.326
I think my medication's
wearing off.

31:12.246 --> 31:14.874
Step right up and help
build a border wall.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.000
A buck a brick.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.627
Keep illegals out
of the South Side.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.504
Thank you.

31:20.588 --> 31:21.964
- No.
- Thank you.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.299
Thanks for making
America great again.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.342
- <i>Por favor, no.</i>
- Thank you.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.848
<i>Dios mío, no.</i>

31:30.931 --> 31:32.182
Thank you.

31:38.105 --> 31:40.691
I'll bet you this place is
chock-full of illegal Mexicans.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.234
Uncle Jose is Guatemalan.

31:42.318 --> 31:43.736
Shouldn't we go to the
Guatemalan place

31:43.819 --> 31:44.820
down the street?

31:44.904 --> 31:46.363
We'll go there next.

31:46.447 --> 31:48.324
This place has chocolate-dipped
ice cream tacos.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.578
<i>Hola.</i>

31:52.661 --> 31:55.080
<i>Necesito uno</i>
"chocolate"-dipped taco.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.165
<i>Dos.</i>

31:56.248 --> 31:57.625
<i>Dos</i> "chocolate"-dipped
tacos.

31:57.708 --> 32:01.670
And also...have you seen this
man on the right?

32:01.754 --> 32:03.756
His name is Jose Gomez.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.966
We have his nephew Santiago.
He's illegal.

32:06.050 --> 32:09.845
Yo, Jose, are you illegal?
These guys are looking for you.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.639
Shit, Kev!
It's him!

32:11.722 --> 32:13.098
We come in peace, Jose! Jose!

32:13.182 --> 32:14.308
Hold on!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

32:17.269 --> 32:18.729
No, no, no, no!
Wait, wait!

32:18.812 --> 32:20.314
- Don't shoot, don't shoot!
- Freeze! On the ground!

32:20.397 --> 32:21.523
Stay down.

32:21.607 --> 32:22.775
Hands where I can see 'em.

32:25.319 --> 32:27.071
So is this
your first time boxing?

32:27.154 --> 32:29.740
Uh, boxing? Yeah.
Throwing a punch? No.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.241
I'm South Side, so...

32:31.325 --> 32:33.410
- Where about?
- North Wallace.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.162
Grew up on the corner
of Homan and Leonard.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.623
The puke-colored house?

32:37.706 --> 32:38.999
The shit-colored house, yes.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.920
Um, your left wrist,
it looks a little atrophied.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.964
Uh, yeah,
I-I broke it a while ago.

32:45.047 --> 32:47.716
- When'd you get the cast off?
- This morning?

32:47.800 --> 32:50.344
And you decided boxing was
the best first thing to do.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.096
Well, South Side, so...

32:52.179 --> 32:53.806
Yeah. So what I want you to do

32:53.889 --> 32:55.140
is just mark through
on your punches

32:55.224 --> 32:56.225
and don't throw
any of them full force.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.852
- All right.
- I'll see you in there.

33:07.403 --> 33:10.656
- Booze for you.
- Oh, thank you.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.616
No booze for you.

33:12.700 --> 33:15.744
Um...that was
a good effort today, man.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.204
You know, no hard feelings,
though, all right?

33:17.287 --> 33:19.164
Yeah, no sweat.

33:19.248 --> 33:21.083
Everyone wins when you're
running for cancer, right?

33:21.166 --> 33:22.710
Sure, sure.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.086
Boone.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.629
Where's my drink?

33:25.713 --> 33:27.798
Yes.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.258
I think he really likes you.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.677
I'm extremely likeable.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.929
So, um...

33:34.013 --> 33:35.973
where's he staying tonight?

33:37.016 --> 33:38.726
I think he's staying with me.

33:40.144 --> 33:41.437
Is he?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.731
I mean, it was a surprise.

33:43.814 --> 33:44.982
I can't have him stay
with Cory.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.066
She'd eat him alive.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.443
Right.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.820
What, is this a big deal?

33:49.903 --> 33:51.989
No.
Uh, no, not at all.

33:56.702 --> 33:57.703
- Yes!
- Nice shot.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.747
Boone, you and me
in the finals.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.331
Let's do it.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.961
All right, rack 'em.
You break.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.380
You seem to be handling
this all pretty well.

34:08.464 --> 34:10.841
Yeah, why shouldn't I be?

34:10.924 --> 34:13.844
'Cause they had sex in my guest
room last time he was on leave.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.179
It sounded like
he was murdering her.

34:16.805 --> 34:17.973
Look, she's not
my girlfriend, all right?

34:18.057 --> 34:19.224
We can fuck whoever we want.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.769
So make her your girlfriend
if you like her.

34:21.852 --> 34:23.771
"Girlfriend" implies a future.

34:23.854 --> 34:25.272
Futures aren't her thing.

34:25.355 --> 34:26.523
Yeah, she says that,

34:26.607 --> 34:29.401
but it's just a bullshit
self-protection thing.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.779
Tami took her mom's death
the hardest.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.323
She tells people she's not
gonna live past 40,

34:34.406 --> 34:36.033
pretends like she doesn't care
if she doesn't have a future.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.702
Shots, please.
Shots over here.

34:39.912 --> 34:43.207
You and me in the consolation
game after they finish, yeah?

34:44.374 --> 34:45.793
Lip?

34:45.876 --> 34:48.045
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

34:54.510 --> 34:55.886
Did you have
to pull a gun on him?

34:55.969 --> 34:57.137
You see a brown guy running,

34:57.221 --> 34:58.722
you assume
he did something wrong.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.390
But you're a black guy.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.975
Oh, you'd think that'd make
a difference, wouldn't you?

35:02.059 --> 35:04.103
He didn't do anything wrong.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.395
He doesn't have any papers.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.815
What are you gonna do
with him now?

35:10.692 --> 35:13.904
Fuck!

35:13.987 --> 35:15.823
- Fly, my Mexican friend!
- Guatemalan!

35:15.906 --> 35:18.075
Guatemalan friend!

35:18.158 --> 35:19.618
Fly!

35:21.703 --> 35:23.747
Higher, just a little bit
hi-higher.

35:23.831 --> 35:24.957
Higher, higher.
Yeah, yeah.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.501
Right next
to that little black kid

35:27.584 --> 35:29.878
with his arm around
the komodo dragon.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.172
Perfect.

35:32.256 --> 35:33.257
Thanks, honey.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.009
So what's the point
of a vision board?

35:36.093 --> 35:37.886
You find images

35:37.970 --> 35:40.139
that-that indicate
what you want out of life,

35:40.222 --> 35:42.474
and you put them on a board
so you can see them.

35:42.558 --> 35:46.019
It inspires you to make
those things manifest.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.313
You know, you guys
should have vision boards.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.274
- Uh, no.
- I don't know.

35:50.357 --> 35:51.733
Oh, come on.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.736
You're young.
Your futures are ahead of you.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.864
What do you want out of life?

36:20.304 --> 36:23.015
Howdy-do.
Rhonda, my old friend.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.099
How are you?

36:24.183 --> 36:25.726
I'll be great in 30 seconds

36:25.809 --> 36:27.853
when I kick
your behind out of here.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.522
Not before I apply
for welfare for my children.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.274
Most of your kids are too old.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.401
Uh, not the old set.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.237
Got some new ones coming in
about eight and a half months.

36:37.321 --> 36:38.655
Oh, how many?

36:38.739 --> 36:41.325
- Could be as many as six.
- Mm, six.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.951
How many women
did you get pregnant?

36:43.035 --> 36:46.079
Just the one.
I'm very virile.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.998
The thing is,
the old set doesn't think

36:48.081 --> 36:50.083
I'm gonna be able to provide
for the new set.

36:50.167 --> 36:53.921
Oh. The old set is smarter
than I figured they'd be.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.381
And I'd like
to prove them wrong.

36:56.465 --> 36:59.426
And going on welfare
is how you plan to do that?

37:01.386 --> 37:02.596
I've done the math.

37:03.347 --> 37:05.766
Start my checks now.

37:05.849 --> 37:08.101
I'll invest the money
in Bitcoin.

37:08.185 --> 37:09.853
You know your way out.

37:09.937 --> 37:12.147
Come on, Rhonda.
Help a brother out.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.107
Excuse me?

37:14.191 --> 37:15.692
"Bitcoin billionaire."
You've heard the phrase?

37:15.776 --> 37:16.860
My kids will be set.

37:16.944 --> 37:19.488
I'll never have to bother you
or the state of Illinois again.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.532
I will see you in nine months.

37:24.451 --> 37:25.744
That's your final word?

37:25.827 --> 37:27.204
- Yes.
- Fine.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.289
This is why people hate
big government.

37:29.373 --> 37:31.250
It's all these
bureaucratic rules.

37:31.333 --> 37:34.628
I'm just trying to help.
I'm coming up with solutions.

37:34.711 --> 37:37.172
The only solution
is to drain the swamp.

37:39.925 --> 37:43.595
All right, guys.
Come on.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.643
There you go.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.354
- You good?
- Yeah.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.981
All right, guys.

37:54.064 --> 37:57.776
So it's gonna be jab, cross,
jab, cross, and then boom.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.111
I want you to put
your full force into the hook.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.196
- Okay.
- Got it? All right, cool.

38:01.738 --> 38:04.074
Nice.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.325
Don't stop breathing, okay?
I want you guys to hear

38:05.409 --> 38:06.785
you guys breathing
before every hit.

38:06.868 --> 38:07.953
- Try again.
- Okay.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.539
Nice.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.416
Made it through, girl.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.126
Okay, you're new,

38:14.209 --> 38:15.794
so I want you to go slow
with it, okay?

38:15.877 --> 38:16.878
Mm-hmm.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.046
Take it easy
on your left wrist.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.172
If you get lost,
that's your target.

38:19.965 --> 38:23.135
- Ready?
- Yep.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.678
Nice, nice. Again.

38:24.761 --> 38:25.679
- Boom--Oh!
- Ooh.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.514
- Sorry.
- Fuck.

38:27.597 --> 38:30.309
That's okay.
Uh, let's try again.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.563
Ooh!

38:34.646 --> 38:36.356
Fuck!

38:36.440 --> 38:38.066
Oh!

38:38.150 --> 38:39.484
You all right?

38:39.568 --> 38:42.654
Jesus Christ.

38:42.738 --> 38:45.490
Oh, man.
Is it bad?

38:46.658 --> 38:47.868
<i>Sí.</i>

38:47.951 --> 38:49.786
<i>♪♪ Hold on ♪♪</i>

38:54.583 --> 38:56.626
Boom, bitches! Fork it over.

38:59.212 --> 39:00.255
Hey, Dirk.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.090
Think you could take
my friend here?

39:02.716 --> 39:06.011
- This little Mexican tamale?
- He's Guatemalan.

39:08.055 --> 39:11.600
Whatever. It'll be like
stealing candy from a piñata.

39:26.490 --> 39:27.491
Yes!

39:28.283 --> 39:30.160
That's a hell
of a left hook you got.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.287
You really put your hip
into that one.

39:32.371 --> 39:34.206
Yeah, sorry.
South Side.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.792
Yeah, you warned me.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.462
I, uh...I get off
in a couple hours.

39:40.545 --> 39:43.423
Maybe you, uh, buy me a drink
to make up for it?

39:44.800 --> 39:46.927
I just broke your nose.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.929
You think I want to buy you
a fucking drink?

39:49.012 --> 39:50.389
- Here we go.
- So, no?

39:50.472 --> 39:52.557
You know, apparently, you can
throw plates at a guy.

39:52.641 --> 39:53.642
- Throw plates?
- You can break

39:53.725 --> 39:54.726
their fucking nose, and still,

39:54.810 --> 39:56.645
they think that
you're hiding their tools

39:56.728 --> 39:58.688
- or you want to fuck them.
- I didn't say that.

39:58.772 --> 40:00.440
- Not related things, Fiona.
- They are related.

40:00.524 --> 40:03.068
You know why? 'Cause all men
are fucking scum.

40:03.151 --> 40:04.903
All...of...them!

40:04.986 --> 40:07.656
- Sorry, Rob.
- Yeah, sorry, Rob.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.950
Sorry about your nose, Rob.
I hope it heals crooked.

40:10.033 --> 40:11.743
- All right, come on, girl.
- Just wanted a drink.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.912
- Rob.
- Get it together.

40:26.675 --> 40:29.136
Looks like my timing's
pretty good.

40:29.219 --> 40:31.263
Christ.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.348
How, uh--how'd you get in here?

40:33.432 --> 40:34.641
Debbie.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.435
- Oh.
- So you shower at night?

40:36.518 --> 40:39.104
No, Cory puked on me
at the Alibi.

40:39.187 --> 40:42.524
You know, uh, you Tamiettis
can really hold your liquor.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.900
You get Cami to puke on you,

40:43.984 --> 40:45.026
you'll have
a Tamietti hat trick.

40:49.406 --> 40:51.533
Look, I get how all this
could be weird for you.

40:51.616 --> 40:54.161
Yeah, I, um...

40:54.244 --> 40:56.830
I'm not entirely sure
how it's not weird for you.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.750
Dead soul probably.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.798
It's cool the way you're just
rolling with it, though.

41:07.591 --> 41:09.384
I just wanted to say that.

41:11.636 --> 41:14.890
Hey, um...

41:14.973 --> 41:16.933
- where's Boone?
- Asleep.

41:17.017 --> 41:18.393
Still on haji time.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.730
Yeah, uh...
Um, I don't think so.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.398
What?

41:27.360 --> 41:29.070
Did you fuck him?

41:34.409 --> 41:35.619
Does it matter?

41:37.162 --> 41:39.206
Yeah, the guy thinks
you're marrying him.

41:39.289 --> 41:41.708
So maybe it should matter
to you, yeah.

41:41.791 --> 41:44.002
Okay, well, why don't you
give me a list of things

41:44.085 --> 41:47.047
that should matter to me,
and I'll get right on it.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.590
You know, not everybody rolls
with things

41:48.673 --> 41:50.133
like you, all right?

41:51.218 --> 41:54.554
Okay.
That is good to know.

42:02.771 --> 42:05.607
That's a beautiful
vision board, Carl.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.567
Isn't this magnificent?

42:08.860 --> 42:10.779
Kelly?

42:12.614 --> 42:14.115
Why don't you tell us about it?

42:14.199 --> 42:16.493
Well, at the bottom
are the hardships

42:16.576 --> 42:18.328
Kelly's helped me realize
I need to overcome--

42:18.411 --> 42:22.374
you know, being poor,
shitty parents, prison.

42:22.457 --> 42:26.336
And at the top is how I'm gonna
overcome those hardships--

42:26.419 --> 42:28.505
by killing for our country.

42:28.588 --> 42:31.132
Oh, outstanding.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.343
All right, honey.

42:33.927 --> 42:36.137
Why don't you tell us
about yours?

42:39.391 --> 42:41.142
Vision boarding sucks.

42:41.601 --> 42:44.646
No, what about your goals
and your dreams?

42:44.729 --> 42:48.233
I don't have
any goals or dreams.

42:50.151 --> 42:53.029
All right.
Tell us about that.

42:58.285 --> 43:00.870
The Major always just had
them for me.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.873
Graduate at the top
of your class,

43:03.957 --> 43:06.209
go to a service academy,
become an officer,

43:06.293 --> 43:08.587
get your legs blown off.

43:08.670 --> 43:11.298
- Your dad's kind of awesome.
- My dad is an ass-munch.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.718
You know, I've never really had
anyone tell me what to do,

43:14.801 --> 43:17.262
but now I know what
my life calling is--

43:17.345 --> 43:19.931
to protect our country
and fight for our freedoms.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.227
What if my calling
is to get fat on a couch

43:24.311 --> 43:26.313
and have your babies?

43:26.396 --> 43:28.356
How fat are we talking?

43:29.941 --> 43:32.360
You can do whatever you want.

43:32.444 --> 43:34.237
You just have to decide.

43:41.244 --> 43:43.204
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

43:50.045 --> 43:52.380
This stuff
is liquid paradise.

43:53.757 --> 43:56.092
Hey, why don't you just
leave the bottle?

43:56.176 --> 43:59.012
- You gonna pay for a bottle?
- Just give it to him.

43:59.095 --> 44:00.764
Good riddance
to that horse piss.

44:00.847 --> 44:02.265
You're a Nubian queen, V.

44:02.349 --> 44:03.892
Uh-uh, no, sir, not from you.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.685
You find Santiago's uncle?

44:05.769 --> 44:08.146
Oh, yeah, found him
and then lost him.

44:08.897 --> 44:10.273
- Ready?
- Yep.

44:12.359 --> 44:13.985
Six kids...

44:14.069 --> 44:18.615
times four years
at Northwestern per kid

44:18.698 --> 44:22.410
times 73,000 a year.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.829
One million, seven hundred
and fifty-two thousand dollars.

44:24.913 --> 44:27.082
Wow, fuck, that's a kick
in the nuts.

44:27.165 --> 44:28.833
Jesus!

44:28.917 --> 44:31.795
"Dreams dead? You're our man.
Be the Hobo Loco Man."

44:31.878 --> 44:33.129
Kev, what is this?

44:33.213 --> 44:35.340
It's one of those flyers
from the Hobo Loco box.

44:35.423 --> 44:38.426
"We're looking for someone
who has perfected the art

44:38.510 --> 44:42.180
of making the best
of what little life has...

44:42.263 --> 44:43.264
given them."

44:44.808 --> 44:46.184
They're holding a competition

44:46.267 --> 44:50.397
to choose
the Hobo Loco spokesperson.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.149
The winner gets
a $50,000 contract

44:53.233 --> 44:56.194
to be in
a social-media campaign.

44:56.277 --> 44:59.989
Well, that'll get one kid half
a semester at Northwestern.

45:00.073 --> 45:02.867
Do you know how many people

45:02.951 --> 45:06.830
have parlayed social media-ness
into fame and fortune?

45:06.913 --> 45:08.581
None.

45:08.665 --> 45:10.959
Oh.

45:11.418 --> 45:13.002
This is me.

46:33.917 --> 46:36.085

with Carl, too.

46:37.045 --> 46:38.129
I want to hang out

46:38.213 --> 46:40.215
and eat trans fat
every once in a while,

46:40.298 --> 46:42.175
maybe skip a run
here and there.

46:42.258 --> 46:43.635
I want to not do extra crunches

46:43.718 --> 46:45.637

a naval vessel.

46:45.720 --> 46:48.014

46:55.438 --> 46:57.357
then you can step the fuck up
right now,

46:57.440 --> 46:59.192
and let's solve it!

47:02.320 --> 47:04.405
Uh, I'm--I'm good.

47:04.489 --> 47:06.449
I don't have a problem.

47:10.370 --> 47:11.788
Okay.

47:13.998 --> 47:16.042
And I'll be at the Gallaghers'
three nights a week.

47:16.125 --> 47:17.919
No. Five.

47:18.711 --> 47:20.046
Debbie's gonna charge me money,

47:20.129 --> 47:21.923
so I need a raise
in my allowance.

47:22.841 --> 47:24.217
Fine.

47:24.300 --> 47:25.885
Yeah, I'm down with that.

47:26.636 --> 47:30.139
Okay, then.
Carl, let's go.

47:30.223 --> 47:33.351
Fuck the tent.
We're having sex in my room.

47:37.522 --> 47:38.857
Carl!

47:40.692 --> 47:42.485
I better go.

47:42.569 --> 47:44.654
Yeah, I guess you better.

48:06.885 --> 48:08.094
May I help you?

48:08.177 --> 48:10.638
- How come my key doesn't work?
- I changed the locks.

48:10.722 --> 48:12.432
You have the rest
of the cash you owe me yet?

48:22.567 --> 48:24.569
Fifty-one twenty-five.
Nice job.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.863
When you get the other 18.75,
I'll get you a key.

48:26.946 --> 48:30.158
- Come on in, Santiago.
- How come he gets to go in?

48:30.241 --> 48:32.118
Kev and V paid in advance.

48:35.663 --> 48:38.666
I knew you were an asshole.

48:38.750 --> 48:40.376
I knew it.

48:46.549 --> 48:50.470
And you "felt
a responsibility to me."

48:50.553 --> 48:53.348
Really?

48:53.431 --> 48:55.808
You don't hurt someone...

48:55.892 --> 49:00.021
...you feel
responsibility for, do you?

49:00.104 --> 49:01.731
No.

49:01.814 --> 49:05.860
Wow, that really took
the shit out of that one.

49:20.166 --> 49:22.877
All right.

49:22.961 --> 49:24.170
What do you do?

49:31.260 --> 49:34.514
God.

49:37.809 --> 49:39.227
Ow!

49:39.310 --> 49:41.604

50:10.800 --> 50:12.301
What do you want?

50:15.096 --> 50:17.348
Is, uh, Boone still asleep?

50:17.432 --> 50:18.850
Yeah.

50:22.687 --> 50:24.313
I fucked your sister.

50:31.070 --> 50:34.407
You're really working hard
for that Tamietti hat trick.

50:34.490 --> 50:36.701
Jesus. That doesn't bother you?

50:36.784 --> 50:37.910
Nope.

50:37.994 --> 50:39.996
Okay.

50:40.079 --> 50:41.956

what to say, Lip.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.959
That shit just--
it doesn't bother me.

50:45.626 --> 50:46.919
Why?

50:48.671 --> 50:51.257
I mean, why?
Why do you care so little?

50:51.340 --> 50:53.426
Is it 'cause of what happened
to your mom or...?

50:53.509 --> 50:54.969
My mom?

50:56.804 --> 50:59.307
My mom died of cancer,
you fucking asshole.

50:59.390 --> 51:01.976
What, and you think she'd want
you to just give up?

51:02.060 --> 51:04.020
Hey, shit's happened
to me, too.

51:04.103 --> 51:06.397
That doesn't mean
I don't feel things.

51:06.481 --> 51:08.066
Now you're feeling things
for me all the sudden?

51:08.149 --> 51:09.984
No, that's not what I said.
Not for you.

51:10.068 --> 51:11.819
