WEBVTT

00:34.033 --> 00:36.745
IT'S OVER NOW. FINISHED.

00:36.828 --> 00:43.460
JOY IS BURIED.
END OF STORY.

00:43.543 --> 00:48.214
{\an1}MUM, I WANT YOU TO COME AND
GET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE!

00:48.298 --> 00:51.050
THEY KILLED JOY!

00:51.134 --> 00:55.138
{\an1}NO, MUM, THIS IS NOT "ANOTHER
BID FOR ATTENTION".

00:55.221 --> 00:57.056
ONE OF MY FRIENDS COULD BE DEAD.

00:59.726 --> 01:03.146
<i>ARE WE ALL READY?</i>

01:03.229 --> 01:03.605
YOU'RE LATE.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.607
(together) SORRY.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.276
GET TO YOUR PLACES. WE'RE
ABOUT TO START.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.403
HAVE YOU SEEN PATRICIA
ON YOUR TRAVELS?

01:10.487 --> 01:11.488
NO.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.907
{\an1}RIGHT, SHE'LL BE GETTING AN
'F' THEN!

01:13.990 --> 01:17.827
WE'LL START THE TEST.

01:18.077 --> 01:30.089
(French audio)

01:33.968 --> 01:36.137
MISS?

01:36.221 --> 01:39.557
{\an5}YES THE TEST'S ALREADY
STARTED, MICK. QUIET,
PLEASE.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.602
{\an1}YEAH I KNOW, I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S JUST,

01:42.685 --> 01:45.188
{\an1}I DIDN'T CATCH THE LAST BIT
OF THE FIRST QUESTION.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.773
CAN YOU START IT
AGAIN PLEASE?

01:46.856 --> 01:50.443
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

02:11.297 --> 02:19.097
(Murmurs from Victor
and Sergeant Roebuck)

02:19.931 --> 02:23.309
(School bell rings)
OKAY, TIME'S UP!

02:24.060 --> 02:26.229
{\an1}QUIETLY.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.247
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?!

02:44.330 --> 02:48.334
{\an1}COME WITH ME. KEEP WALKING.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.426
MAN, I'VE FLUNKED BIG TIME!

02:56.509 --> 02:59.304
AH, DON'T WORRY BOO. WHO
NEEDS FRENCH ANYWAY?

02:59.387 --> 03:02.807
{\an1}IF EVERYONE SPOKE ENGLISH LIFE
WOULD BE SO MUCH SIMPLER.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.350
{\an1}WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
MATE.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.062
{\an5}SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU'RE
GONNA DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER
THAN YOU THINK YOU WILL.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.940
DO YOU SERIOUSLY
THINK SHE'S DEAD?

03:11.024 --> 03:14.360
"JOY'S BURIED"? WHAT
ELSE COULD THAT MEAN?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.029
BURIED IN HER WORK?

03:16.112 --> 03:19.157
{\an1}WERE TALKING JOY,
NOT YOU MARA.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.452
{\an4}I SPOKE TO MY MUM AND SHE
SAID THAT JOY'S PARENTS
HAVE PHONED HER

03:22.535 --> 03:24.913
{\an4}AND TOLD HER THEYíRE TAKING
HER TO SOME INTERNATIONAL
SCHOOL OR SOMETHING.

03:24.996 --> 03:28.041
{\an1}AND THEY DIDN'T WANT ME
TO GET IN TOUCH.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.876
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

03:29.959 --> 03:31.502
WELL HAVE YOU CALLED
THE POLICE?

03:31.586 --> 03:34.714
{\an1}THEY'RE IN ON IT.
EVERYONEíS IN ON IT.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.884
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.304
{\an1}YOU DO BELIEVE ME
DON'T YOU?

03:41.387 --> 03:44.057
OF COURSE.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.647
PATRICIA!

03:50.730 --> 03:54.859
{\an5}OH DEAR MARA, LOSING
FRIENDS LEFT, RIGHT AND
CENTRE AREN'T YOU?

03:54.943 --> 03:59.572
{\an5}ALTHOUGH, I WILL GIVE YOU
TEN OUT OF TEN FOR TRYING
TO WIN MICK ROUND.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.617
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING IN
THE GIRLS' TOILETS, CREEP?

04:02.700 --> 04:06.996
BUT TELL ME. WHAT IS THE
FRENCH FOR CHEAT?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.331
YOU WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.332
{\an3}HA HA HA,

04:09.415 --> 04:12.335
"MRS ANDREWS, MARA
CHEATED ON THE FRENCH TEST

04:12.418 --> 04:16.172
{\an1}SO SHE COULD STEAL MICK FROM
AMBER, OH AND BY THE WAY VICTOR.

04:16.255 --> 04:20.551
MARA AND PATRICIA THINK
THAT YOU KILLED JOY."

04:20.843 --> 04:24.931
{\an1}OKAY, FINE. WHAT
DO YOU WANT?

04:25.014 --> 04:27.684
VERY GOOD ANSWER.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.327
THE EYE....

04:56.379 --> 05:00.049
I THOUGHT ALFIE AND JEROME
WERE ON CHORES TONIGHT.

05:00.133 --> 05:05.388
NO. IT'S MY NIGHT.
THEY'RE BUSY ANYWAY.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.640
YEAH, REALLY BUSY.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.643
DON'T YOU DO ANYTHING
OTHER THAN WORK?

05:10.727 --> 05:14.230
{\an4}YEAH, I'VE GOTTA CUT BACK
ON THAT I MEAN, WHAT IS
THIS, A SCHOOL..?

05:14.313 --> 05:16.065
PATRICIA JUST, GET A LIFE.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.902
NINA, HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?

05:19.986 --> 05:23.072
(Amber counts in French)

05:23.156 --> 05:25.116
I HEARD ABOUT JOY.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.743
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

05:26.826 --> 05:30.580
{\an5}FRIEND OF MINE DIED
YOU KNOW. BUT HIS
GHOST LIVES ON.

05:30.663 --> 05:36.252
{\an4}YEAH RIGHT. I SAW THAT
EPISODE OF "HAUNTED HIGH
SCHOOLS" TOO.

05:36.335 --> 05:40.298
AMBER, GIVE IT A
REST YEAH?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.341
ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU NEED
TO GET IN CONTACT WITH JOY,

05:42.425 --> 05:46.637
I CAN HELP YOU. UNLESS
YOU'RE TOO SCARED?

05:47.513 --> 05:51.392
{\an4}I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ABOUT TO
SAY THIS - BUT TELL ME MORE
JEROME.

05:51.476 --> 05:56.147
COME TO MY ROOM. MIDNIGHT.
ALL WILL BECOME CLEAR.

05:56.814 --> 06:00.651
{\an4}LOOK AT THE BANISTERS, LOOK
AT THE SHAPE THAT'S CUT INTO
THEM.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.529
{\an4}I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS SOME
KIND OF WEIRD ABSTRACT DESIGN
BUT IT'S NOT,

06:03.613 --> 06:04.113
IT'S THE EYE OF....

06:04.197 --> 06:06.032
THE EYE OF HORUS!

06:04.197 --> 06:06.032
YES!

06:06.115 --> 06:09.243
{\an5}THE SAME AS ON YOUR
LOCKET. THE SAME AS WE
FOUND IN THE ATTIC.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.954
I DID A BIT OF RESEARCH
ABOUT THIS PLACE

06:12.038 --> 06:14.832
{\an5}AND IT TURNS OUT THE
FROBISHER-SMYTHES HAD A
BIT OF A THING FOR EGYPT.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.418
{\an1}WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THEY
NAMED THE HOUSE ANUBIS.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.837
{\an1}AND THE HIEROGLYPHICS ON THE
PAINTING IN THE ATTIC.

06:19.921 --> 06:23.424
{\an1}I'M BETTING THOSE ARE THE
PEOPLE WHO HID THE CYLINDERS.

06:23.508 --> 06:27.136
{\an4}BUT WHY? IF THIS WAS THEIR
HOUSE, WHY WOULD THEY NEED
TO HIDE ANYTHING?

06:27.220 --> 06:31.682
{\an5}I DON'T KNOW. BUT THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY WE'RE GOING
TO FIND OUT.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.227
{\an1}WE NEED TO LISTEN TO
THOSE CYLINDERS.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.697
{\an1}OH WAIT, HOW ARE WE
GOING TO GET IN?

06:54.664 --> 06:57.458
<i>(Door shuts)</i>

06:59.460 --> 07:01.712
{\an1}(Croakily) BAD DEEDS,
BAD DEEDS...

07:01.796 --> 07:03.714
(knocking at the door)

07:06.717 --> 07:09.595
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! IT WON'T
WORK IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.265
YEAH, WELL, THE GOTH-VAMP
LOOK IS A BIT LAST YEAR.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.308
YOU THINK JOY'S
DEAD YEAH?

07:14.392 --> 07:18.062
WELL THERE'S ONE
WAY TO FIND OUT.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.862
{\an1}NOW WHAT?

07:25.945 --> 07:31.868
WE TURN THIS.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.413
(loud screaming sound)

07:35.496 --> 07:36.873
(gasps)

07:35.496 --> 07:36.873
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:36.956 --> 07:40.042
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT WAS WAY
CREEPIER THAN I WAS HOPING.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.920
IT SOUNDED LIKE A VOICE.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.799
YEAH A VOICE. OR A MOAN.

07:46.883 --> 07:53.639
{\an1}A DEATH-BED MOAN. OF SOMEONE
WHO REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO DIE.

07:53.723 --> 07:57.226
THAT'S VERY DESCRIPTIVE.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.229
ANYWAY, I MEAN, THIS ONE
LOOKS LIKE IT'S BLANK.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.565
{\an1}MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT MADE
THAT NOISE..?

08:02.648 --> 08:07.653
HERE TRY THIS ONE. WIND
IT FASTER THIS TIME.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.783
{\an4}THEN THERE WAS THE TIME
JEROME STOLE MRS ANDREWS'
SCARF

08:12.867 --> 08:14.827
{\an1}BECAUSE IT SMELT OF
HER PERFUME.

08:14.911 --> 08:19.665
AND SNUGGLED UP IN BED WITH IT,
BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING HIS MUM.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.376
{\an1}OH THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I'M LEAVING.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.503
WAIT. ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, RELAX.

08:26.714 --> 08:34.597
"ALFONZO" WHAT ABOUT JOY?
JOY, CAN YOU HEAR US?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.224
{\an1}(girlís voice)
PATRICIA?

08:36.307 --> 08:38.351
{\an1}I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO
CALL ME, PATRICIA.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.227
{\an1}WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE?

08:40.311 --> 08:44.273
(loud scream)
WHAT WAS THAT?

08:51.239 --> 08:52.490
WHO'S THERE?

08:52.573 --> 08:53.616
TURN IT OFF!

08:53.699 --> 08:57.745
{\an1}HOW? I DON'T KNOW HOW! I'VE
ONLY EVER USED MP3S.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.705
(screaming stops)

09:07.046 --> 09:09.590
{\an4}(laughs)
WELL, I THINK WE'VE PESTERED
JOY ENOUGH FOR ONE NIGHT.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.592
{\an1}YEAH - SHE DID ALWAYS GET
GROUCHY AFTER 10...

09:11.676 --> 09:19.308
STOP TALKING ABOUT HER LIKE
SHE'S... GOOD-NIGHT WEASELS.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.686
(They laugh)

10:46.687 --> 10:49.857
(Whispers) NO, NOT YET.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.592
{\an1}MORE MISCHIEF CORBIERE,
I'M SURE OF IT.

11:16.675 --> 11:23.641
BUT WHO, HMM? AND WHAT?

11:24.517 --> 11:28.145
THE COAST IS CLEAR.

11:30.106 --> 11:35.069
{\an3}LET'S GO.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.862
MY HEART IS STILL POUNDING.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.280
{\an3}MINE TOO.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.325
{\an4}I HOPE I CAN SLEEP. WHO AM I
KIDDING? I MIGHT NEVER SLEEP
AGAIN.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.077
SAME.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.288
{\an1}I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT AWAY
WITH IT...NIGHT.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.958
NIGHT.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.000
{\an1}CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT AWAY
WITH WHAT?

11:50.084 --> 11:54.046
{\an1}WHAT? NO, NOTHING, NOTHING,
NOTHING AT ALL.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.340
{\an4}YOU'VE BEEN SNEAKING AROUND
WITH FABIAN IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT;

11:56.424 --> 12:01.137
{\an4}YOU'RE HEART'S BEATING REALLY
FAST AND YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT
AWAY WITH SOMETHING.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.890
{\an1}OH! YOU WERE
HAVING A SECRET DATE!

12:04.974 --> 12:06.100
NO, NOT EXACTLY--

12:06.183 --> 12:10.271
{\an1}THIS IS SO EXCITING. YOU, ME,
MICK, FABIAN, DOUBLE-DATES.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.605
I CAN SEE IT ALREADY.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.065
{\an1}I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL
EVERYONE!

12:13.149 --> 12:16.652
{\an1}NO! NO-ONE. YOU TELL ABSOLUTELY
NO-ONE. PROMISE?

12:16.735 --> 12:21.323
{\an1}OH, I GET IT. SECRET LOVE.
SO ROMANTIC.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.327
YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.085
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.380
SO WHAT'S ALL THIS I HEAR
ABOUT YOU AND NINA THEN?

12:36.464 --> 12:37.798
WHAT? NO. AHHH.

12:45.514 --> 12:50.519
HEY NINA, HEY. THING IS UM,

12:50.603 --> 12:56.358
{\an4}ME AND YOU, WE'VE KNOWN EACH
OTHER FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
NOW, AND IT'S JUST..

12:56.442 --> 12:57.985
THE THING IS, AMBER.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.404
OH, I TOLD HER NOT TO
SAY ANYTHING.

13:00.488 --> 13:04.658
SHE CAUGHT ME SNEAKING IN AND
JUST ASSUMED. AND WELL I MEAN,

13:04.742 --> 13:07.745
{\an4}I COULDN'T EXACTLY TELL HER,
"WE WERE CHASING AN ANCIENT
MYSTERY."

13:07.828 --> 13:11.540
SO I LET HER GO WITH
HER THEORY....

13:11.624 --> 13:17.046
I MEAN YOU AND ME,
RIDICULOUS. RIGHT?

13:17.129 --> 13:21.175
YEAH, YEAH. TOTALLY.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.516
{\an5}I COULDN'T SLEEP. WHAT
IF WE'VE WOKEN SOME
SORT OF EVIL SPIRIT?

13:28.599 --> 13:31.185
{\an4}YEAH, AND WHAT IF IT COMES
AND POSSESSES YOU IN THE
NIGHT?

13:31.268 --> 13:34.730
{\an1}OKAY, AS FAR OUT AS THIS MAY
BE, TRIXIE, I WAS MAKING IT UP.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.982
ER, I KNOW, YOUR
ACTING STINKS.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.693
BUT YOU DIDN'T MAKE UP THAT
SCREECHING NOISE, DID YOU?

13:39.777 --> 13:46.492
<i>PATRICIA, ALFIE, AND</i>
<i>JEROME... PAIRS, PLEASE.</i>

13:46.575 --> 13:51.038
{\an1}THREE LITTLE WORDS. "I LOVE
YOU".

13:51.121 --> 13:53.874
{\an1}SEE, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU
SAY, IT'S HOW YOU SAY IT.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.710
IN YOUR PAIRS, I WANT
YOU TO TELL A STORY,

13:56.794 --> 14:01.590
{\an4}BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT HAVING
A CONVERSATION USING THOSE
THREE WORDS.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.801
I LOVE YOU.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.845
OKAY?

14:08.013 --> 14:11.016
{\an5}GET YOUR SCRUBBING BRUSH
OUT CINDERELLA. I'VE DONE
YOU A LITTLE CHORE LIST.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.144
{\an1}ACTUALLY, COME TO THINK OF IT,
IT'S NOT THAT LITTLE.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.272
{\an3}I LOVE YOU.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.482
I LOVE YOU.

14:18.566 --> 14:25.155
{\an5}MARA AND JEROME: GREAT
ACTING YEAH. YEAH, I CAN
ALMOST FEEL THE HATRED.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.996
I LOVE YOU!

14:34.373 --> 14:36.542
I LOVE YOU.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.169
{\an1}(angered) HEY, PATRICIA...
I SAID I LOVE YOU!

14:39.253 --> 14:40.796
DID ANYONE SEE THAT?

14:40.879 --> 14:41.547
WHAT?

14:41.630 --> 14:44.508
THAT MAN. HE WAS
STARING AT ME.

14:46.677 --> 14:50.014
I SAW HIM. I DID!

14:57.479 --> 15:00.399
HEY FABIAN! LOOK,

15:00.482 --> 15:03.068
{\an4}I'VE MADE YOU AND NINA A SCRAP
BOOK TO PUT ALL YOUR PHOTOS AND
TICKET STUBS AND STUFF IN.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.030
{\an1}MICK AND I HAVE GOT TEN OF
THEM ALREADY. HE'S SO SWEET,

15:06.113 --> 15:09.116
HE LETS ME HANG ONTO THEM,
BUT I KNOW HE LOVES THEM.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.661
AMBER. ME AND NINA? THERE
IS NOTHING GOING ON.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.829
{\an1}WHAT? BUT IF YOU WEREN'T ON
SOME SECRET DATE,

15:13.912 --> 15:17.583
{\an1}THEN WHAT WERE YOU SNEAKING
AROUND FOR?

15:17.666 --> 15:24.173
{\an4}I WOULD TELL YOU, AMBER, BUT
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'LL MAKE
SOMETHING UP ANYWAY.

15:24.256 --> 15:29.011
EVERYONE THINKS I'M CRAZY.
EVEN I THINK I'M CRAZY.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.639
{\an1}WE TRIED TO CONTACT JOY LAST
NIGHT

15:31.722 --> 15:34.850
AND I THINK WE'VE
CONTACTED SOMETHING ELSE.

15:34.933 --> 15:37.353
"SOMETHING ELSE"?

15:37.436 --> 15:40.189
I THINK JOY'S DEAD.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.959
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.878
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

16:02.961 --> 16:04.880
(Camera click)

16:04.963 --> 16:07.383
{\an4}TELL ME, OR I'LL GO TO MR SWEET
AND I'LL TELL HIM YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING WEIRD

16:07.466 --> 16:11.553
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT IS... OR SOMETHING.

16:11.637 --> 16:15.557
OKAY. BUT YOU TELL NO-ONE!

16:15.641 --> 16:20.813
{\an1}I'LL TAKE IT TO THE GRAVE. I
NEVER TELL A SECRET.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.607
BEFORE YOU STARTED, SHE
JUST DISAPPEARED.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.901
THEY SAID SHE'D GONE HOME,

16:25.984 --> 16:28.570
BUT SHE'S NOT ANSWERED
ANY OF MY CALLS.

16:28.654 --> 16:33.283
{\an4}THEY'VE EVEN ERASED HER FROM
THE SCHOOL PHOTO AND TAKEN
THE ANUBIS HOUSE PHOTO DOWN.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.451
{\an1}THEY?

16:34.535 --> 16:38.414
THE TEACHERS. VICTOR.
EVEN THE POLICE.

16:38.497 --> 16:45.087
{\an1}I SWEAR, MR WINKLER, I SWEAR TO
YOU, I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.964
I BELIEVE YOU.

16:47.673 --> 16:52.761
{\an5}I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD
AMBER. SHE HAS A MOUTH THE
SIZE OF A BLACK HOLE.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.805
{\an1}SHE CAUGHT ME WITH THE
PUZZLE PIECE.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.140
SHE KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.349
YOU COULDN'T LIE?

16:57.433 --> 17:00.769
{\an1}I KNOW. I KNOW. IT JUST CAME
OUT. I'M AN IDIOT, OKAY.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.606
HEY. NO, NO, NO.
DON'T SAY THAT.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.734
{\an1}EVERYTHING WILL BE
FINE I'M SURE.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.838
{\an7}.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.838
{\an4}THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE BOTH
HERE. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING
TO GET EATEN BY A GHOST.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.256
{\an1}SSH.

18:11.340 --> 18:15.719
{\an4}(Whispering) AMBER, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE? AND WHAT'S
WITH THE HEELS?

18:15.803 --> 18:18.722
{\an5}I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT
ON ANYTHING. AND THESE
ARE MY LUCKY HEELS.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.183
SO WHY AREN'T YOU
WEARING THEM?

18:21.266 --> 18:24.102
I CAN'T ACTUALLY RUN
AWAY IN THEM.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.105
AMBER WHAT'S WITH THE CLOVES OF
GARLIC? THIS ISN'T 'TWILIGHT'.

18:27.189 --> 18:30.359
THE BIBLE SAYS,
ALWAYS BE PREPARED.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.611
AMBER, THAT'S
THE BOY SCOUTS.

18:32.694 --> 18:36.406
GUYS, LET'S JUST FOCUS.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.408
WHAT IF IT MAKES THAT
HORRIBLE NOISE AGAIN?

18:38.492 --> 18:41.829
{\an1}DON'T WORRY. THIS SHOULD DO
THE TRICK, BUT IF IT DOESN'T,

18:41.912 --> 18:45.124
{\an1}GET READY TO PULL
THE HORN OFF.

18:51.004 --> 18:56.218
{\an4}<i>(Girl's voice) "MOTHER AND</i>
<i>FATHER HAVE GIVEN THE HOUSE</i>
<i>A NAME. ANUBIS. "</i>

18:56.301 --> 18:57.678
IT'S A GIRL.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.929
<i>"THEY'RE GOING AWAY AGAIN SOON.</i>

18:59.012 --> 19:03.517
{\an1}<i>TO EGYPT, I THINK. FATHER SAYS</i>
<i>HE HAS TO, FOR HIS WORK.</i>

19:03.600 --> 19:08.939
{\an1}<i>BUT WHEN THEY GO, I'LL BE ON MY</i>
<i>OWN AGAIN. WITH HIM."</i>

19:09.022 --> 19:11.733
WHY'S SHE CRYING?
IT'S SO...

19:11.817 --> 19:13.527
SAD.

19:13.610 --> 19:17.197
{\an4}<i>"I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE. I'M</i>
<i>FRIGHTENED OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN</i>
<i>TO ME."</i>

19:17.281 --> 19:20.909
I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE
EITHER! CAN WE GO PLEASE?

19:20.993 --> 19:24.163
(Crash and clatter)
AMBER!

19:30.168 --> 19:32.588
{\an1}RIGHT, THIS IS GETTING FAR
TOO RISKY.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.339
{\an1}I VOTE WE GET OUT OF HERE AND
FIND A SENSIBLE,

19:34.423 --> 19:37.217
{\an1}AND MORE SAFE WAY OF
LISTENING TO THESE THINGS.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.846
AND AMBER... QUIETLY!

19:54.026 --> 19:56.111
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:56.194 --> 20:00.365
{\an4}YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE SNEAKING
AROUND AFTER LIGHTS OUT.

20:00.449 --> 20:06.288
{\an1}HELLO, TRUDY, ICE CREAM,
BROWNIES. YUM YUM.

20:06.371 --> 20:11.835
{\an4}HMM, YES. UNLIKE YOU, MISS
MILLINGTON, I WAS NOT BORN
YESTERDAY,

20:11.919 --> 20:13.462
NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:13.545 --> 20:16.715
{\an1}I'M STARVING. AND I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR STUPID RULES.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.550
I'M ON A FRIDGE RAID!

20:18.634 --> 20:22.387
{\an1}AMBER MILLINGTON, GET
BACK HERE NOW!

20:27.976 --> 20:29.227
{\an3}IMPRESSIVE.

20:29.311 --> 20:34.274
{\an4}SHE'S JUST FULL OF SURPRISES.
MAYBE SHE CAN BE TRUSTED
AFTER ALL.

20:39.404 --> 20:43.492
JOY? JOY?

20:43.575 --> 20:46.453
JOY, IS THAT YOU?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.669
(door slams)

20:53.752 --> 20:56.171
ARGH!!!!

20:56.254 --> 21:00.509
CAN YOU SEE HIM?
