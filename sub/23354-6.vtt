00:02.436 --> 00:04.037
Tonight on
Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.071 --> 00:07.975
Gordon heads
to sunny South Florida,

00:08.008 --> 00:09.810
but ends up
in a gloomy situation.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.411
Has the business ever
worked in nine years?

00:11.445 --> 00:12.713
No.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.114
At a restaurant
called Le Bistro.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.883
Don't you dare go
to the wrong table.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.918
In spite of the business
failing miserably...

00:17.951 --> 00:18.919
I don't get it!

00:18.952 --> 00:20.654
You don't
have to get it.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.356
This chef owner still operates

00:22.389 --> 00:23.790
Like a stubborn dictator.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.359
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.461
Who doesn't listen to anybody.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.162
I'll do what
the  I like!

00:29.196 --> 00:30.000
Not his employees...

00:30.000 --> 00:30.364
Not his employees...

00:30.397 --> 00:32.699
Alex, this is your fault.
You sort it out.

00:32.733 --> 00:33.934
Not his wife.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.969
Where you goin'?
Get back here!

00:36.003 --> 00:37.170
You ed up
enough tonight.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.640
And not even his customers.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.707
He wants it
medium rare.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.209
Tell him
to  himself.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.311
Yeah?

00:44.344 --> 00:47.180
Tonight, Gordon is in
for the match of the year.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.149
It's like a competition
between you and I.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.517
You don't intimidate me.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.386
But he is not backing down.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.321
You treat your wife
like a  dog.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.522
Don't you
go there!

00:55.556 --> 00:57.024
I'm gonna do it.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.425
Get ready for a head-to-head
confrontation...

00:58.458 --> 01:00.000
Why can't you
just cook it?

01:00.000 --> 01:00.427
Why can't you
just cook it?

01:00.460 --> 01:02.029
As Chef Ramsay attempts

01:02.062 --> 01:03.864
to get through
to a man so arrogant...

01:03.897 --> 01:05.432
I don't know if you're
hard of hearing.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.200
And so resistant to change...

01:07.234 --> 01:09.236
There's one person cooking.
That's me.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.504
That his restaurant

01:10.537 --> 01:12.573
may be impossible
to rescue.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.975
You are
blatantly ignorant.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.243
That's tonight

01:16.276 --> 01:18.011
on Kitchen Nightmares.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.730
Lighthouse Point,

01:36.763 --> 01:38.765
An exclusive community

01:38.799 --> 01:41.702
six miles outside
of Boca Raton, Florida,

01:41.735 --> 01:43.670
lined with large mansions,

01:43.704 --> 01:44.805
pristine beaches,

01:44.838 --> 01:48.709
and home to Le Bistro.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.044
After studying
at top Michelin star restaurants

01:51.078 --> 01:52.579
throughout Europe,

01:52.613 --> 01:56.049
Andy Trousdale met and married
the love of his life, Elin.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.551
Come on,
give me a kiss.
See ya.

01:57.584 --> 01:58.752
See ya later.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.000
Andy and I met in St. Thomas,

02:00.000 --> 02:00.721
Andy and I met in St. Thomas,

02:00.754 --> 02:03.624
at the restaurant
that he was executive chef,

02:03.657 --> 02:05.626
and I fell in love
with his food.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.394
It was love at first bite.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.062
I've worked as a chef

02:09.096 --> 02:10.530
In many different areas,

02:10.564 --> 02:12.666
in big hotels, small hotels,
little restaurants,

02:12.699 --> 02:14.534
and can run rings
around anyone.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.869
Anyone.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.505
Tired of working
for other people,

02:18.538 --> 02:21.141
They moved to South Florida
in 2001

02:21.174 --> 02:22.676
to fulfill Andy's dream

02:22.709 --> 02:25.512
of opening up
a restaurant of his own.

02:25.545 --> 02:26.546
Good evening.
Le Bistro restaurant.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.748
Can I I help you?

02:27.781 --> 02:28.982
Hello!

02:30.851 --> 02:33.286
Elin and myself
decided to buy a restaurant

02:33.320 --> 02:35.522
because she obviously
tried my food,

02:35.555 --> 02:37.324
she realized
how dedicated I was,

02:37.357 --> 02:39.860
and I'm very
on the ball with everything.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.495
Hey, what's up
with that?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.563
Get it off the shelf!
Get that off there!

02:43.597 --> 02:46.600
Andy is not only a chef,
he's a creator.

02:46.633 --> 02:47.868
Don't forget my apples.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.603
You need apples cooked,
three nice rings.

02:49.636 --> 02:50.704
I would really say

02:50.737 --> 02:53.273
He's a master
at what he does.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.574
And if I didn't think

02:54.608 --> 02:57.477
my husband
was a brilliant chef,

02:57.511 --> 02:59.379
I would not be
in this business with him.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.000
Elin?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.848
Elin?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.350
I'm right here.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.485
Table 14

03:05.519 --> 03:07.220
Is ready for the entree.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.789
I'm gonna run this now.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.425
There seems to be
a lot of wealth in the area,

03:11.458 --> 03:12.793
but for some reason,

03:12.826 --> 03:15.762
the people that live
in lighthouse point

03:15.796 --> 03:19.099
do not seem to appreciate
Andy's food.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.534
Andy?
They didn't want it.

03:20.567 --> 03:21.535
They don't want
anything else

03:21.568 --> 03:22.869
it's too dry.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.638
The problem is he think
he's perfect,

03:24.671 --> 03:26.907
So he really don't like it

03:26.940 --> 03:28.742
when people
send back the food.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.000
Steak is gristly.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.243
Steak is gristly.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.012
Get the
out of here.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.480
That's beautiful
beef tenderloin.

03:33.513 --> 03:34.848
They're
a local customer.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.650
I don't
give a.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.752
Alex, this your fault.
You sort it out.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.587
My food's perfect.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.788
I've worked
long and hard

03:41.822 --> 03:43.557
and paid for the right
to have what I want.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.758
Be quiet.

03:44.791 --> 03:45.959
Whether people come

03:45.992 --> 03:47.527
And like it,
love it, or hate it,

03:47.561 --> 03:50.063
it's my business, it's
my reputation, it's my food.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.431
I'm the chef,
and I'm the owner,

03:51.465 --> 03:54.701
and that's what I want.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.671
I really wish I knew

03:57.704 --> 04:00.000
what the major problem
with Le Bistro was.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.974
what the major problem
with Le Bistro was.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.343
I can't say it's the food.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.612
Of course,
I can't say it's me.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.515
I don't believe
it's my staff.

04:08.548 --> 04:11.718
I just don't know
what the problem is.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.819
Be happy.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.554
Don't be, uhh!

04:14.588 --> 04:16.723
It's a bistro,
it's fun, it's upbeat.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.660
Right now, I can't keep up
with the debt.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.363
And I don't know where
we're going to get the money

04:23.396 --> 04:25.298
to pay the debt off.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.967
It's going
from bad to worse.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.702
For the work and effort

04:28.735 --> 04:29.803
And everything
we're doing,

04:29.836 --> 04:30.000
everything
we've put into this,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.071
everything
we've put into this,

04:31.104 --> 04:32.873
we've definitely not
benefited anything.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.107
If this restaurant closes,

04:34.141 --> 04:35.675
that last thing
I want to do

04:35.709 --> 04:39.212
is go and work
for some idiot somewhere else.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.881
I hate idiots.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.527
South Florida, known
for many great things--

04:53.560 --> 04:54.628
great beaches, water sports,

04:54.661 --> 04:56.897
and a place where people
like to dine out.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.566
Le Bistro is chef-owned,
and he's on his ass.

04:59.599 --> 05:00.000
Now, today,
he's closed for lunch,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.001
Now, today,
he's closed for lunch,

05:01.034 --> 05:02.435
'cause he's holding
a cooking class.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.738
I'm about to pay him
a surprise visit.

05:04.771 --> 05:05.739
Here we go.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.507
Uh, the menu
is a goat cheese

05:07.541 --> 05:08.675
that we have
on the menu,

05:08.708 --> 05:10.977
and we put a little
bee pollen on.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.547
You arrange it so it
looks like a flower.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.485
Hello.
Hi.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.519
Hello.
Good afternoon.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.887
Hello, ladies, gentlemen,
good afternoon.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.622
Nice to see you.
Please, don't let me stop you.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.790
How are you?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.025
Not a problem.
Nice to meet you.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.459
You don't look very happy.
What's the matter?

05:26.493 --> 05:27.427
Uh, just right
in the middle of--

05:27.460 --> 05:28.628
Oh, fine. okay.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.930
The first impression I had

05:29.963 --> 05:30.000
When Gordon Ramsay
walked in the door was,

05:30.000 --> 05:31.464
When Gordon Ramsay
walked in the door was,

05:31.498 --> 05:32.966
what the
is he doin' here?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.467
So what's
for entree, Chef?

05:36.970 --> 05:37.938
Nice.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.040
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.441
Nice to have you here.

05:41.474 --> 05:42.676
Are you the...server?

05:42.709 --> 05:43.777
Uh, she's my wife.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.245
Oh, she's your wife.
Oh, how nice.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.581
Lucky lady.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.349
So maybe
like a large dice.

05:49.382 --> 05:50.550
Bring them to a boil,

05:50.584 --> 05:51.952
let 'em simmer
for about 15 minutes.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.287
Gonna put a little bit
of butter in there.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.758
Should
it be smoking?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.000
So that's okay.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.293
So that's okay.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.095
We obviously just
made a little smoke.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.231
Um...

06:04.264 --> 06:05.665
Oh!
Whoa!

06:07.200 --> 06:10.937
I felt that Gordon Ramsay
was just bein' a.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.940
Thank you very much
hope you enjoyed it.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.075
Nice to see you.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.077
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.478
So how do you
think that went?

06:18.511 --> 06:19.646
Happy with it?

06:19.679 --> 06:21.615
Uh, not really.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.083
What's the matter?

06:23.116 --> 06:24.885
Those cooking classes go
very, very well for us.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.053
I don't want you
to  it up

06:27.087 --> 06:29.322
to try and make a mockery
of what I'm doin'

06:29.356 --> 06:30.000
in front of these people.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.191
in front of these people.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.593
Are you always
like this, or...?

06:33.627 --> 06:34.594
Always like what?

06:34.628 --> 06:36.162
So defensive.

06:36.196 --> 06:40.433
You asked me a question,
I'm answering you.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.203
Okay, so let's lighten up
a little bit.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.638
Come over, darling,
please.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.840
So when did you
start cookin', Andy?

06:46.873 --> 06:49.075
I'd worked for
uh, Michel Roux in London.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.177
You worked for Michel Roux
at the waterside inn?

06:51.211 --> 06:52.512
That's exactly what
happened to me,

06:52.545 --> 06:54.247
so we had very similar
sort of training.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.149
Honestly, from a chef's
point of view,

06:56.182 --> 06:58.118
you've got your stripes.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.000
So, in your mind,
the one single reason

07:00.000 --> 07:01.021
So, in your mind,
the one single reason

07:01.054 --> 07:02.489
to why the restaurant's
not working,

07:02.522 --> 07:03.757
Elin, would be what?

07:03.790 --> 07:05.091
For some reason,

07:05.091 --> 07:07.493
people don't find it
appealing to come in here,

07:07.526 --> 07:08.794
and I mean the locals.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.129
Our bread and butter
clientele

07:10.129 --> 07:12.064
don't seem
to enjoy the restaurant.

07:12.097 --> 07:13.632
They're not biting.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.569
People really
and truly

07:16.602 --> 07:19.272
are pretty demanding.

07:19.305 --> 07:22.074
I'm a bit
fed up with it.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.310
Has the business ever
worked in nine years?

07:24.343 --> 07:25.311
No.

07:25.344 --> 07:26.345
Never?

07:26.346 --> 07:27.547
It's gone
up and down.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.782
It's never been great.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.000
Andy, Elin said--
your dear wife said,

07:30.000 --> 07:31.584
Andy, Elin said--
your dear wife said,

07:31.584 --> 07:33.486
very quickly, no.
if it's never worked,

07:33.519 --> 07:34.520
don't be embarrassed.

07:34.553 --> 07:35.688
I'm not.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.891
But I'm just sayin'
that she's wrong.

07:38.924 --> 07:40.526
Right, I'd like to eat.

07:40.559 --> 07:42.628
Seen the cooking class.

07:42.661 --> 07:44.296
Fantastic resume, and I'd
love to taste your food.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.598
Anything?
Yeah.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.066
Show off.
Show me what you're made of.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.367
I'll just take it
off the menu.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.169
Yeah?

07:50.202 --> 07:51.637
I don't know

07:51.670 --> 07:53.572
what Chef Ramsay's
going to say,

07:53.606 --> 07:55.775
because Andy's food
is very good,

07:55.808 --> 07:57.243
and he somehow manages

07:57.276 --> 07:59.612
to stay ahead
of the trends all the time

07:59.645 --> 08:00.000
with his menus
and his recipes.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.180
with his menus
and his recipes.

08:01.213 --> 08:02.715
Just as we always do.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.383
I'm not changing up.

08:04.416 --> 08:05.885
We don't have two or three
people cooking on the stove.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.019
It's me on the stove.

08:07.052 --> 08:08.053
Listen,
you gonna hand me

08:08.087 --> 08:09.321
that
out of that fridge?

08:09.355 --> 08:11.123
No  around.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.658
If I say I want it this way,

08:12.691 --> 08:14.293
I want it that way,
because I've earned it.

08:14.326 --> 08:15.327
I'm payin' for it.

08:15.361 --> 08:16.996
Okay, just a minute
for the lamb,

08:17.029 --> 08:18.764
and we're gonna have everything
else comin' right out.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.399
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

08:20.432 --> 08:21.667
Alex.
Gordon.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.373
Alex, do your job.
Let's go.

08:27.406 --> 08:29.675
Okay,
here's the rillette.

08:29.708 --> 08:30.000
Mm!

08:30.000 --> 08:30.943
Mm!

08:30.976 --> 08:31.944
Bon appetit.
Thank you.

08:31.977 --> 08:32.945
You're welcome.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.387
I think I just
chipped my tooth.

08:41.420 --> 08:42.454
You did?

08:42.488 --> 08:44.456
Looked like
duck cartilage.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.025
Show him the bone
as well.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.762
I think I just
busted my tooth.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.066
Listen, go away.
Go away.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.269
That's it.
That's the way he is.

08:57.303 --> 08:58.771
You cannot change Andy.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.000
Alex!

09:00.000 --> 09:00.506
Alex!

09:03.442 --> 09:05.845
Coconut curry,
jalapeno.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.781
My God, garlic coconut
lamb inside the...

09:08.814 --> 09:10.249
It is.

09:10.282 --> 09:11.917
Did you show chef
the cartilage?

09:11.951 --> 09:13.652
Yeah, I did.
He, uh...

09:13.686 --> 09:15.788
Told me to like, go.
Go away.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.289
He didn't want
to talk about it.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.958
That's the truth.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.531
It's so rubbery.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.499
Huh?

09:27.533 --> 09:28.601
The texture
of the lamb,

09:28.634 --> 09:29.768
it's just
very rubbery.

09:29.802 --> 09:30.000
Mm,
Mediterranean

09:30.000 --> 09:31.503
Mm,
Mediterranean

09:31.537 --> 09:33.706
crispy fried
lamb curry roll.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.609
I'm in Florida,
not in Mumbai.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.411
He hate it.

09:39.445 --> 09:40.846
Whatever!

09:40.880 --> 09:43.916
This is.

09:43.949 --> 09:45.451
No, that's not why.

09:45.484 --> 09:46.652
Whatever.

09:46.685 --> 09:47.686
I'd stop right there
if I were you.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.288
Go away.

09:49.321 --> 09:51.323
Gordon Ramsay trashed
everything I did.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.791
I think that's
his whole goal

09:52.825 --> 09:56.462
is to trample over you,
make you feel bad.

09:56.495 --> 09:58.464
Okay.

09:58.497 --> 10:00.000
Uh, right,
that was interesting.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.966
Uh, right,
that was interesting.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.067
So that was you
at your best.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.270
As in my best I've ever
done in my career,

10:04.303 --> 10:05.337
or you mean
the best here?

10:05.371 --> 10:06.639
Or you mean

10:06.672 --> 10:08.107
is that the best food
that we have?

10:08.140 --> 10:09.875
Yes and no.
I mean, you know, was that--

10:09.909 --> 10:11.677
I asked you
to cook for me and--

10:11.710 --> 10:14.446
yeah, just tell me
how that was for you.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.948
That was good
for this restaurant.

10:15.981 --> 10:17.716
It's good for here.

10:20.352 --> 10:21.353
Here's the problem.

10:21.387 --> 10:22.955
The food's
old-fashioned

10:22.988 --> 10:25.124
and totally,
totally out of taste

10:25.157 --> 10:26.625
in terms
of where you are.

10:26.659 --> 10:27.993
That's your opinion.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.000
Your food is sad,

10:30.000 --> 10:30.896
Your food is sad,

10:30.930 --> 10:32.431
stuck in the '80's.

10:32.464 --> 10:33.732
Possibly the most
shocking dish

10:33.766 --> 10:35.301
anywhere in Florida,

10:35.334 --> 10:37.336
the crispy lamb roll.

10:37.369 --> 10:38.404
What in the hell
was goin' on

10:38.437 --> 10:39.571
when we put
that one together?

10:39.572 --> 10:40.606
Shredded coconut,

10:40.607 --> 10:42.475
horrible
rubbery texture.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.711
Almost on the verge
of being depressing.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.849
Any more you want
to put me down for?

10:49.849 --> 10:51.884
The rillette,

10:51.917 --> 10:53.485
I don't know if anyone
gave you feedback,

10:53.519 --> 10:55.221
but it was on the verge
of breaking my tooth.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.089
Oh, right, I'm supposed
to believe that.

10:57.122 --> 10:58.524
You're not looking
at me now

10:58.557 --> 10:59.558
as if
I'm exaggerating.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.000
It was full
of cartilage.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.593
It was full
of cartilage.

11:00.626 --> 11:01.594
I'm listening
to what you're saying.

11:01.627 --> 11:02.962
I didn't know.
No one told me.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.330
No one told you?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.267
Listen, go away.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.635
Two seconds, sir.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.870
Do you not
tell the chef

11:10.903 --> 11:13.606
that the first mouthful
was full of cartilage?

11:13.639 --> 11:15.441
Yeah, I did.

11:15.474 --> 11:16.442
I mean, I told him.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.344
He told me
to go away.

11:18.377 --> 11:20.680
When your waiter comes to tell
you valuable information,

11:20.713 --> 11:23.816
you should know those
kind of things, right?

11:23.850 --> 11:26.052
Can I just have two minutes
with Andy on my own?

11:26.085 --> 11:28.187
Would you mind?
Elin, would you mind?

11:28.187 --> 11:29.288
Honestly?
Yeah?

11:29.321 --> 11:30.000
Straight up,
I'm here to help.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.890
Straight up,
I'm here to help.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.093
So far, all you're doing
is just slam me down,

11:34.126 --> 11:35.194
that's all
you've done with me.

11:35.227 --> 11:36.428
I think it's about you.

11:36.462 --> 11:39.231
You're gonna blame me.
I know you are, yeah.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.966
He's not my chef.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.302
He's not--
we don't work for him.

11:43.335 --> 11:44.603
You're the chef/owner.

11:44.637 --> 11:45.938
Right.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.073
So why won't you
take responsibility?

11:48.107 --> 11:49.074
I'm the chef.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.509
If you don't like it,

11:50.543 --> 11:51.944
that's fine.
it's your opinion.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.279
- You don't like it?
- We're  no good.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.381
I'm lousy, whatever.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.517
Me,
do you have issues?

11:58.518 --> 11:59.552
Coming up...

11:59.585 --> 12:00.000
Andy is ready
to make a confession.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.220
Andy is ready
to make a confession.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.488
I'm a loser,
everybody.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.056
But that doesn't mean

12:04.089 --> 12:05.324
he is ready to change.

12:05.357 --> 12:06.458
Go back and tell her

12:06.492 --> 12:07.526
choose something else.

12:07.559 --> 12:08.761
Madness.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.129
As he continues to battle

12:10.162 --> 12:11.330
with the patrons...

12:11.363 --> 12:12.498
Tell him
to  himself.

12:12.531 --> 12:13.499
Wow!

12:13.532 --> 12:14.733
The wait staff...

12:14.767 --> 12:16.668
Get back here! You've
ed up enough tonight.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.036
And Chef Ramsay.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.338
Don't you
go there!

12:19.371 --> 12:20.339
Don't point that
thing!

12:20.372 --> 12:21.907
You want to
our life!

12:21.940 --> 12:23.942
That's next
on Kitchen Nightmares.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.283
In the short time

12:30.316 --> 12:32.118
that Chef Ramsay
has been at Le Bistro,

12:32.151 --> 12:34.754
he is already feeling
very uncomfortable

12:34.787 --> 12:37.023
with the arrogant owner
that cooked the food.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.224
You don't like it?

12:38.257 --> 12:39.759
We're no good,
I'm lousy, whatever.

12:39.792 --> 12:40.960
Now it's time to see

12:40.993 --> 12:42.929
How this tiny
South Florida restaurant

12:42.962 --> 12:45.398
handles its customers
in a dinner service.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.775
One.

12:55.808 --> 12:56.579
That's the way
they do it.
Wow.

12:56.579 --> 12:58.845
That's the way
they do it.
Wow.

12:58.878 --> 13:01.247
I would love to be able
just to take the orders,

13:01.280 --> 13:04.016
but Andy only wants
one person writin' the checks.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.257
Is Alex the only one who
takes orders in there?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.826
Yes, one person
takes the orders,

13:13.860 --> 13:16.529
and it slows down
things for Andy.

13:16.562 --> 13:17.797
I've just noticed
two tables there

13:17.830 --> 13:19.232
are waiting to get
their order taken.

13:19.265 --> 13:22.635
Okay, I'll go out
and see what's happening.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.036
Hi, how are you?

13:24.070 --> 13:25.438
Awesome. Yay!

13:25.471 --> 13:26.579
Do you know
what you'd like?
Yes.

13:26.579 --> 13:26.706
Do you know
what you'd like?
Yes.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.441
Okay, who would
like to start?

13:28.474 --> 13:29.976
Oh, my God.

13:33.946 --> 13:34.947
So what do you do?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.115
Usually,
I pull out everything

13:36.148 --> 13:37.350
when he calls
an order on,

13:37.383 --> 13:39.452
so he can get it
on the fire.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.820
So do you actually cook
as well, or not?

13:40.853 --> 13:43.389
I can, but Andy
does not let me cook.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.627
This is definitely his little
kingdom here, isn't it?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.662
He's a one-man band.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.497
Hey, hey, hey, we don't
have time for talkin'.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.765
I don't care if it's
him or the queen.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.501
Just keep goin'
over to that refrigerator,

13:55.535 --> 13:56.579
you look in there
and go over everything.

13:56.579 --> 13:57.136
you look in there
and go over everything.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.538
Wow.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.608
Whose is this writin'?

14:02.642 --> 14:03.809
That's me.
Why?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.311
Because--
Why are you doin' that?

14:05.344 --> 14:06.946
You're goin'
against everything we said,

14:06.979 --> 14:08.347
and everything we did.
I'm sorry.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.349
Where you goin'?
Get back here!

14:10.383 --> 14:13.019
You ed up
enough tonight.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.854
People are
really dumb sometimes,

14:14.887 --> 14:16.689
And they think with their ass
rather than their brain.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.958
It's an hour
into dinner service,

14:18.991 --> 14:21.160
And this part chef,
part dictator

14:21.193 --> 14:23.829
has now allowed a few entrees
to leave his kitchen.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.064
Andy?

14:25.097 --> 14:26.579
Am I ready
to take this?

14:26.579 --> 14:26.966
Am I ready
to take this?

14:26.999 --> 14:28.935
Been waitin' for you, yeah.
The fries are there.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.570
I don't know what
you want me to do.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.537
That goes
on the plate.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.505
Madness.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.573
For you, gentlemen.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.174
Hi. Thank you
for your patience.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.742
It's an inedible.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.411
She was looking
for medium well-done.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.715
I got you, okay.

14:42.748 --> 14:43.983
Okay, thank you.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.919
Andy?

14:46.953 --> 14:49.288
She wants it well,
but not charred.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.023
They asked for medium well,
that's medium well.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.491
She wants it more.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.060
I don't care. We're
not doin' it again, no.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.194
So go back and tell her

14:55.227 --> 14:56.195
choose something else.

14:56.228 --> 14:56.579
Oh, jeez.

14:56.579 --> 14:58.564
Oh, jeez.

14:58.598 --> 15:02.101
Houston,
we have a situation.

15:02.134 --> 15:03.869
I'm very sorry,
but the chef

15:03.903 --> 15:06.672
would like you to make
a different choice.

15:08.774 --> 15:11.377
This is unbelievable 'cause
there's a lot of similarities

15:11.410 --> 15:12.745
between Andy and I.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.981
We're both English,
and we both studied in Paris,

15:15.014 --> 15:16.682
but there's one thing
we don't share in common.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.417
I care
about my customers.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.720
He clearly
doesn't give a.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.989
What a shame.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.579
Andy!

15:26.579 --> 15:27.326
Andy!

15:27.360 --> 15:29.195
Well, what's
terrible about it?

15:29.228 --> 15:30.429
He wants it
medium rare.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.897
Tell him
to  himself.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.266
Yeah?

15:34.300 --> 15:36.402
Why are you looking
for excuses, Andy?

15:36.435 --> 15:38.204
Every  table
that's come back,

15:38.237 --> 15:39.672
All you want to do
is argue with them.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.707
Look at the potatoes!
They're black!

15:41.741 --> 15:43.242
So  sad.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.977
Well, all you've done
is slam me

15:45.011 --> 15:46.245
since the second
you've been here.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.346
That's what you do,
right?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.881
Why are you acting like this?

15:48.914 --> 15:50.016
I don't get it!

15:50.049 --> 15:52.318
You don't
have to get it.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.887
Andy, seriously.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.579
You don't give a ,
big boy.

15:56.579 --> 15:56.956
You don't give a ,
big boy.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.290
You're lookin'
for a justification

15:58.324 --> 15:59.925
every time
you  up.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.428
A man that can't even
accept his own mistakes.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.230
I'll get you started,
wipe your ass and tell you,

16:04.263 --> 16:06.332
"It's brilliant, Chef.
You're amazing."

16:06.365 --> 16:08.501
Treat your wife
like a  dog.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.202
Don't bring my wife
into it.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.470
I'm gonna do it!

16:11.504 --> 16:12.505
You know why?

16:12.538 --> 16:13.939
Don't bring
my  wife into it!

16:13.973 --> 16:15.408
Don't you
go there!

16:15.441 --> 16:16.475
Don't point
that.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.943
You want to
our life!

16:17.977 --> 16:18.978
Just calm down!

16:19.011 --> 16:20.146
I just asked
politely.

16:20.179 --> 16:21.280
Don't talk to her
like that.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.415
You haven't got
respect for her,

16:22.448 --> 16:23.816
how can you get people
workin' for you?

16:23.849 --> 16:25.251
Yeah, whatever.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.579
This is.

16:26.579 --> 16:26.619
This is.

16:29.588 --> 16:30.890
Bye-bye.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.491
After getting nowhere

16:32.525 --> 16:33.693
with Andy
in the kitchen...

16:33.726 --> 16:35.161
Before you leave,
would you be so kind

16:35.194 --> 16:37.697
just to fill out these
customer comment cards?

16:37.730 --> 16:38.631
Gordon steps outside

16:38.664 --> 16:39.832
not only to cool off,

16:39.865 --> 16:42.568
but to get some feedback
from the clientele...

16:42.601 --> 16:43.736
Let's go.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.906
Something Andy has never done.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.275
I asked
your customers leaving

16:49.308 --> 16:50.609
the restaurant
this evening

16:50.643 --> 16:52.978
to rate the service
out of ten,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.113
to rate the food,

16:54.146 --> 16:55.715
to rate
the experience.

16:55.748 --> 16:56.579
So on average,

16:56.579 --> 16:57.516
So on average,

16:57.550 --> 16:59.985
four out of ten
for the service.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.220
On that note,

17:01.253 --> 17:04.790
why do you take
all the tables' order?

17:04.824 --> 17:06.092
That's what they want.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.094
Who? Oh.
Me.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.129
So what's the rationale
behind it? The logic?

17:10.162 --> 17:11.564
It helps to space
a little bit,

17:11.597 --> 17:12.765
buys a few minutes.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.600
There's three of you
in the kitchen!

17:14.633 --> 17:17.203
Like I said, I don't know
if you're hard of hearing,

17:17.236 --> 17:18.704
but...

17:18.737 --> 17:20.239
There's
one person cooking.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.307
That's me.

17:21.340 --> 17:25.745
Food they rated
three out of ten.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.579
But the most
important question was,

17:26.579 --> 17:27.113
But the most
important question was,

17:27.146 --> 17:29.482
would they come back?

17:29.515 --> 17:33.419
And about 78%
of them said no.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.621
And the weird thing

17:35.654 --> 17:37.456
about the whole
service tonight,

17:37.490 --> 17:39.592
every time
something comes back,

17:39.625 --> 17:40.760
as far
as you're concerned,

17:40.793 --> 17:41.961
your customers
are wrong.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.864
No, that's
your evaluation.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.465
That's
what I watched.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.667
Don't make you right

17:48.701 --> 17:50.870
And me wrong
about every single thing.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.905
Oh, my God.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.507
Why do you
have to be a?

17:54.540 --> 17:56.075
'Cause you act
like such a.

17:56.108 --> 17:56.579
thing.

17:56.579 --> 17:58.077
thing.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.413
It's like a competition
between you and I.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.481
You don't
intimidate me.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.516
What?

18:03.549 --> 18:04.650
Stand up and bully me.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.218
That's all you're
trying to  do.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.253
You're so wrapped up

18:07.286 --> 18:08.821
in a deluded
little bubble.

18:08.854 --> 18:11.157
And not one person
has got the balls

18:11.190 --> 18:13.159
to tell you truth,
it's not workin'.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.195
You are
blatantly ignorant.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.897
Whatever.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.465
You.
Come on.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.066
You're one-sided.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.068
That's all you want to
do, man.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.236
Excuse me.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.270
Oh, no.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.446
It was a miserable evening

18:34.479 --> 18:36.248
in which Chef Ramsay
tried continually

18:36.281 --> 18:37.349
to get through to Andy.

18:37.382 --> 18:38.784
That's your evaluation.

18:38.817 --> 18:40.285
Oh, my God.

18:40.318 --> 18:41.486
But this stubborn chef

18:41.520 --> 18:43.555
flat out refuses
to listen.

18:43.588 --> 18:44.956
Just don't want
to get better, do you?

18:44.990 --> 18:46.091
What?

18:46.124 --> 18:48.393
You've never,
ever, ever understood

18:48.427 --> 18:50.062
the value
of your customers,

18:50.095 --> 18:52.364
let alone your staff,

18:52.397 --> 18:54.399
because you don't
give a  about them.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.102
I'm a loser,
everybody.

18:59.071 --> 18:59.709
Oh, my God.
I'm the worst.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.139
Oh, my God.
I'm the worst.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.176
Anything else?
You got any more?

19:04.209 --> 19:06.011
Guys, can you
give me two minutes

19:06.044 --> 19:07.412
on my own, please?

19:07.446 --> 19:09.581
Guys, can you
just back off, please?

19:12.317 --> 19:13.852
Would you mind?

19:13.885 --> 19:14.886
Yeah?

19:14.920 --> 19:15.954
Everybody.

19:15.987 --> 19:18.090
Everybody, out.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.429
We could
never tell him that,

19:24.463 --> 19:25.564
'cause he won't listen.

19:25.597 --> 19:27.265
He won't listen
to nobody.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.668
Do you want your restaurant
to work, yes or no?

19:29.701 --> 19:29.709
Obviously, yes.

19:29.709 --> 19:30.702
Obviously, yes.

19:30.735 --> 19:32.971
Okay, good,
but stop there.

19:33.004 --> 19:35.107
That's the most honest
you've been all day.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.843
You don't need to be
so defensive with me.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.511
Tonight was
about observing

19:39.544 --> 19:40.879
and watching
the  setup.

19:40.912 --> 19:43.315
You have created
a monster here.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.983
Are you committed

19:45.016 --> 19:47.052
to making this place
change?

19:47.085 --> 19:49.321
That's all I need to know
before I'm out of here.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.555
That is it.

19:50.589 --> 19:53.725
No, no, I need to hear it
from you.

19:53.758 --> 19:55.760
You, you, you, you--
Andy.

19:55.794 --> 19:56.962
You.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.697
Thank you.
I'll see you in the morning.

19:58.730 --> 19:59.709
Good night.
Get some sleep.

19:59.709 --> 20:00.298
Good night.
Get some sleep.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.400
me.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.436
Gentlemen, good night.

20:04.469 --> 20:07.372
One stubborn , huh?

20:07.405 --> 20:08.974
Andy's statement

20:09.007 --> 20:10.108
that he is open to change

20:10.142 --> 20:11.943
has kept Chef Ramsay around

20:11.977 --> 20:13.745
for at least another day,

20:13.778 --> 20:15.380
but Gordon
is fully aware

20:15.413 --> 20:18.550
that he is at the beginning
of a huge uphill battle.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.118
Take a seat.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.887
Sit down
and relax.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.121
How cool
is this?

20:23.155 --> 20:24.456
Terrific.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.690
Right,
I wanted to come out

20:25.724 --> 20:28.360
and clear the air.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.709
Because of the stigma
and your training

20:29.709 --> 20:31.163
Because of the stigma
and your training

20:31.196 --> 20:32.364
and the proudness,

20:32.397 --> 20:34.099
that's
a defense mechanism.

20:34.132 --> 20:36.768
But before
we start changing,

20:36.801 --> 20:38.069
you have to understand

20:38.103 --> 20:39.171
that we have to identify

20:39.204 --> 20:40.739
the problems
with the restaurant.

20:40.772 --> 20:42.974
You've got to understand
where you've gone wrong.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.309
I want you to come
downstairs with me.

20:44.342 --> 20:45.710
I've got a little
surprise for you.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.145
Sandwich would be nice.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.480
Sandwich,.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.048
Stop thinkin'
about your tummy.

20:50.081 --> 20:52.784
Now, come down.

20:52.817 --> 20:54.719
Because
in this door, okay?

20:54.753 --> 20:57.322
I've arranged for you
to meet, yeah?

20:57.355 --> 20:59.157
Some very special people.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.460
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.629
How are we?
Good to see you.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.498
In this room,

21:06.531 --> 21:08.700
are your previous customers.

21:08.733 --> 21:11.703
And they've got some very
important information

21:11.736 --> 21:14.406
to tell you
about the experience

21:14.439 --> 21:17.842
the last time they ate
at Le Bistro.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.644
Madam, tell me,
the experience,

21:19.678 --> 21:20.745
what was it like?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.247
It just in general

21:22.280 --> 21:23.615
did not live up
to our expectations

21:23.648 --> 21:26.985
and was not at all what
we expected for a bistro.

21:27.018 --> 21:28.053
What was the
biggest disappointment

21:28.086 --> 21:29.154
across
the whole experience?

21:29.187 --> 21:29.709
The food.

21:29.709 --> 21:30.222
The food.

21:30.255 --> 21:31.389
The food.

21:31.423 --> 21:33.291
Andy,
anything to say?

21:33.325 --> 21:34.326
Nothing to say.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.894
Nothing?

21:35.927 --> 21:37.362
Anyone else?

21:37.395 --> 21:38.997
We were there
a year or so ago,

21:39.030 --> 21:41.600
none of us can remember
the experience.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.734
We didn't even know
the restaurant

21:42.767 --> 21:43.802
was still
in business until--

21:43.835 --> 21:45.604
I don't really
want to comment,

21:45.637 --> 21:47.872
because I don't
want to get into it.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.441
Isn't this valuable
information?

21:49.474 --> 21:51.610
When did you eat
at the bistro?

21:51.643 --> 21:53.645
When was the last time?
I've eaten there twice.

21:53.678 --> 21:55.880
The last time was probably
about a year ago.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.315
And describe
the experience.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.516
You walk through
the door,

21:58.550 --> 21:59.709
it's kind
of dark, gloomy.

21:59.709 --> 21:59.718
it's kind
of dark, gloomy.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.319
There's no one
in there at all.

22:01.353 --> 22:02.854
You know, and then
you sit down to eat,

22:02.887 --> 22:04.956
and it's like you have
everyone staring at you

22:04.990 --> 22:06.157
when you're sitting
there eating.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.525
It's just
very uncomfortable.

22:07.559 --> 22:08.827
Honestly, deep down,
are you lookin'

22:08.860 --> 22:11.162
for naked women
dancin' on the table?

22:11.196 --> 22:13.231
Whoa.
Hey, hey, relax.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.000
I said, what are you
lookin' for?

22:15.033 --> 22:16.501
Relax, relax,
relax.

22:16.534 --> 22:17.569
They don't
want to see

22:17.602 --> 22:18.670
naked dancers
on the table.

22:18.703 --> 22:19.971
Come on, Andy.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.206
These are customers.

22:21.239 --> 22:22.874
He didn't want
to hear about it.

22:22.907 --> 22:25.443
It was a wall that Andy
had around him.

22:25.477 --> 22:28.313
He needs to listen
to what the people are saying.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.709
Why do you take it
so personally?

22:29.709 --> 22:30.081
Why do you take it
so personally?

22:30.115 --> 22:32.183
This is really not nice
for us,

22:32.217 --> 22:34.286
so I gotta
suck it up right now.

22:34.319 --> 22:36.254
It's not personal.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.156
Yeah.

22:38.189 --> 22:40.058
So getting you guys
here to day was valuable

22:40.091 --> 22:43.495
for me to understand
where we're going wrong.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.964
I'm sure Andy and Elin
will take the information

22:45.997 --> 22:46.931
in the right text.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.199
But thank you.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.035
In spite of Andy again

22:50.068 --> 22:52.137
Refusing to take advantage
of any feedback,

22:52.170 --> 22:53.772
Chef Ramsay pushes on

22:53.805 --> 22:55.440
to another problem
in the restaurant.

22:55.473 --> 22:56.641
Andy's inability

22:56.675 --> 22:59.477
to delegate anything
to his sous chef.

22:59.511 --> 22:59.709
To make his life easier...

22:59.709 --> 23:00.712
To make his life easier...

23:00.745 --> 23:01.913
Yeah?

23:01.946 --> 23:02.981
I'll do the dish with you,

23:03.014 --> 23:05.750
then tonight,
as we service,

23:05.784 --> 23:09.454
Hendrick can cook the dish.

23:09.487 --> 23:11.856
So is he gonna do
that dish?

23:11.890 --> 23:14.626
He's gonna purely cook
one snapper,

23:14.659 --> 23:15.827
just to make
your life easier.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.429
Whatever.

23:17.462 --> 23:19.097
Are you all right, by the way?
You don't look very happy.

23:19.130 --> 23:20.699
You seem like you've gone
into a little bubble again.

23:20.732 --> 23:21.966
No, I haven't, no.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.768
Okay, great. Have you cooked
snapper before?

23:23.802 --> 23:25.637
Yes.
You have? Good.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.539
Gettin' on the stove'll
be nice tonight, cookin'.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.707
You know,
a snapper dish.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.709
Help speed up
just to get food out.

23:29.709 --> 23:30.241
Help speed up
just to get food out.

23:30.275 --> 23:32.510
If you square it up,
the fish cooks evenly.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.979
Yeah? And nothing's
overcooked on the outside.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.915
Fish in, always lay
away from you.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.850
Yeah? Skin side down,
fingers on the top.

23:38.883 --> 23:40.118
I wish we had
a stove there,

23:40.151 --> 23:41.152
and I could
keep him there.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.721
My concern was is that

23:42.754 --> 23:43.788
He's gonna cook
the fish properly

23:43.822 --> 23:45.023
and get it out in time.

23:45.056 --> 23:46.491
Take your fish,

23:46.524 --> 23:47.792
beautifully glazed,

23:47.826 --> 23:49.794
and set that on top
of your vinaigrette.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.296
You like
a little taste first?

23:51.329 --> 23:52.764
Yeah.

23:52.797 --> 23:54.466
Elin, please.

23:54.499 --> 23:56.000
Local-caught snapper,

23:56.034 --> 23:58.136
and more importantly
right now

23:58.169 --> 23:59.671
pretty good
for the bottom line.

23:59.704 --> 23:59.709
In terms
of profit-wise.

23:59.709 --> 24:02.140
In terms
of profit-wise.

24:02.173 --> 24:03.441
That's really good.

24:03.475 --> 24:05.143
I loved the dish.
It was delicious.

24:05.176 --> 24:07.812
Hopefully, we'll sell
most of the specials tonight,

24:07.846 --> 24:09.447
and Hendrick
will be taking

24:09.481 --> 24:11.549
some of the pressure
off of Andy.

24:11.583 --> 24:12.617
Andy,
I know you're busy.

24:12.650 --> 24:15.353
Come have
a little taste.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.921
Yeah?

24:16.955 --> 24:18.456
Very good.

24:18.490 --> 24:19.491
There you go.

24:22.827 --> 24:24.195
Very nice.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.663
Happy with that
on your menu?

24:27.932 --> 24:29.033
Coming up...

24:29.067 --> 24:29.709
That ticket's like
a hot potato in your hand.

24:29.709 --> 24:30.301
That ticket's like
a hot potato in your hand.

24:30.335 --> 24:31.603
Get it out!

24:31.636 --> 24:33.805
The battle between Andy
and Gordon

24:33.838 --> 24:36.040
Escalates
to a full-out war.

24:36.074 --> 24:37.409
If they want it
more cooked,

24:37.442 --> 24:38.777
why can't you
just cook it?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.645
And when Le Bistro

24:40.678 --> 24:42.147
hits its breaking point...

24:42.180 --> 24:43.615
It wasn't given to me
on a  plate.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.418
So don't
throw it away.

24:46.451 --> 24:48.586
Chef Ramsay gets devious.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.121
Something I need
to show you very quickly.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.790
You won't believe what he does

24:51.823 --> 24:53.691
In order to get
through to Andy.

24:53.725 --> 24:54.893
I'm so sorry,

24:54.926 --> 24:56.494
but now you've
overstepped the mark!

24:56.528 --> 24:57.629
That's coming up

24:57.662 --> 24:58.997
on Kitchen Nightmares.

25:03.268 --> 25:04.869
In spite his frustration

25:04.903 --> 25:06.304
and disappointment
with Andy,

25:06.337 --> 25:09.174
Chef Ramsay has taken
a number of steps

25:09.207 --> 25:10.809
to make sure
tonight's dinner service

25:10.842 --> 25:12.177
will be smoother.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.145
We'll do ten portions
of this stuff tonight, okay?

25:14.179 --> 25:15.280
Gordon has created

25:15.313 --> 25:18.049
A new tasty,
profitable snapper special.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.718
Lay away from you
so you don't splash.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.954
He's insisted that
sous chef Hendrick will cook...

25:22.987 --> 25:25.190
Hi. Welcome
to Le Bistro.

25:25.223 --> 25:26.391
And lastly, he's made sure

25:26.424 --> 25:28.660
That both waiters
will be taking orders.

25:28.693 --> 25:29.761
Which
are your tables?

25:29.794 --> 25:30.866
I got this side.

25:30.866 --> 25:31.196
I got this side.

25:31.229 --> 25:33.565
With different waiters taking
the order at the same time,

25:33.598 --> 25:35.433
it's easy
to accommodate customers.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.035
The whole place
should run as a team.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.636
We have some great
specials tonight.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.338
A local-caught
red snapper.

25:40.371 --> 25:41.840
I'd like to have
the snapper.

25:43.975 --> 25:45.977
It was so good.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.046
Now that both waiters
are taking orders,

25:48.079 --> 25:50.782
One of Chef Ramsay's goals
has been realized.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.383
Order in!

25:52.417 --> 25:54.419
Orders are getting
into the kitchen much quicker.

25:54.452 --> 25:55.787
Four bistros,
a middle,

25:55.820 --> 25:58.823
one mahi,
and three snapper.

25:58.857 --> 26:00.158
Order in.

26:00.191 --> 26:00.866
One gazpacho,
one escargot on order.

26:00.866 --> 26:02.327
One gazpacho,
one escargot on order.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.561
Guys, heard?

26:03.595 --> 26:04.696
Heard.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.964
The only question is,

26:05.997 --> 26:07.298
can Andy handle it?

26:07.332 --> 26:08.733
And order in!

26:08.766 --> 26:10.735
Tell me when to fire
those snappers, Andy.

26:10.768 --> 26:13.238
Not yet, because the duck's
gonna be a few minutes.

26:13.271 --> 26:15.440
What table's next?

26:15.473 --> 26:18.209
Tryin' to do
this one here.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.844
Do I need to fire
that snapper or no?

26:19.878 --> 26:21.179
Hang on,
I don't want you to fire

26:21.212 --> 26:22.514
without me bein' ready.

26:22.547 --> 26:24.048
30 minutes into service,

26:24.082 --> 26:26.317
and the kitchen
is already behind.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.253
Hendrick is waiting
on the sideline

26:28.286 --> 26:29.554
for Andy to tell him
what to do,

26:29.587 --> 26:30.866
and Andy is still cooking
one dish at a time.

26:30.866 --> 26:33.525
and Andy is still cooking
one dish at a time.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.527
Andy, what's
going on with six?

26:35.560 --> 26:36.828
I'm still missin'
the mahi

26:36.861 --> 26:38.196
on the last table
that came on order.

26:38.229 --> 26:40.031
That ticket's like
a hot potato in your hand.

26:40.064 --> 26:42.267
Get it out!

26:42.300 --> 26:44.269
Waitin' on that.

26:44.302 --> 26:45.937
It's not making
sense, Elin.

26:45.970 --> 26:47.572
It's not making
sense.

26:47.605 --> 26:49.374
He'll get it.
I know he will.

26:49.407 --> 26:50.575
I still think Andy

26:50.608 --> 26:52.043
needs to get
up to par.

26:52.076 --> 26:53.278
He can't do
everything himself.

26:53.311 --> 26:54.913
Andy needs more support
back there.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.549
I need
all the entrees now.

26:57.582 --> 26:59.083
Elin, don't make
matters worse.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.552
It's bad enough
havin' him on my ass.

27:00.585 --> 27:00.866
I'm just sayin',
six has been there forever.

27:00.866 --> 27:04.155
I'm just sayin',
six has been there forever.

27:09.827 --> 27:10.795
This is a joke.

27:10.828 --> 27:12.230
That's one hour,
ten minutes now,

27:12.263 --> 27:13.565
not one entree served.

27:13.598 --> 27:16.201
He has a restaurant
next door to him.

27:16.234 --> 27:18.570
I'm about to prove
a very important point.

27:20.605 --> 27:22.307
How are you?
Good evening.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.641
Busy night
here tonight, huh?

27:23.675 --> 27:25.276
Would you mind
if I order to go?

27:25.310 --> 27:26.277
No, sir,
not at all.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.280
I will go
for the seared tuna.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.281
Okay.
How long?

27:30.315 --> 27:30.866
About ten minutes.

27:30.866 --> 27:31.282
About ten minutes.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.117
Thank you very much.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.425
Hell.

27:42.393 --> 27:44.362
Still no entrees.
Can you believe that?

27:46.497 --> 27:48.233
Well, that's ten minutes.

27:48.266 --> 27:49.500
This restaurant, on average,

27:49.534 --> 27:51.703
75 to 80 minutes
for an entree.

27:51.736 --> 27:52.770
Let's go.

27:56.641 --> 27:57.842
Ready?
Yes, it is.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.377
Does food always
come out that quick?

27:59.410 --> 28:00.411
Yes.
Thank you.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.082
Incredible.

28:05.049 --> 28:07.252
That is absolutely delicious.

28:07.285 --> 28:08.419
There's somebody else

28:08.453 --> 28:11.089
that really needs
to know about this now.

28:12.257 --> 28:13.758
Still no entrees.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.961
Just need 30 seconds.

28:16.995 --> 28:18.329
Oh, God.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.231
Something I need
to show you very quickly

28:20.265 --> 28:22.400
out of the frustration
in terms of

28:22.433 --> 28:25.570
why food's
taking so long...

28:25.603 --> 28:26.971
I decided to do
a little experiment.

28:27.005 --> 28:30.108
I ran in there,
ordered an entree.

28:30.141 --> 28:30.866
Tuna.

28:30.866 --> 28:31.309
Tuna.

28:31.342 --> 28:34.112
It came out,
ten minutes.

28:34.145 --> 28:36.381
They are full.

28:36.414 --> 28:37.882
I'm just trying
to show you

28:37.915 --> 28:39.751
what's happening
on your doorstep.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.688
We're going to have to have
a serious talk.

28:43.721 --> 28:46.291
By the way,
it was delicious.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.968
Let me know when I need
to send those snappers.

28:57.001 --> 28:57.969
You ready?

28:58.002 --> 28:59.270
Can you just give
me a second,

28:59.304 --> 29:00.438
just so I can get
these out?

29:00.471 --> 29:00.866
Send the snapper.

29:00.866 --> 29:02.140
Send the snapper.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.375
Focus and get quicker
out of the box.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.944
Go, go, go!

29:06.978 --> 29:08.946
After Chef Ramsay's
constant prodding,

29:08.980 --> 29:11.983
Hendrick begins to cook.

29:12.016 --> 29:12.984
I'm firing one snapper.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.319
Go for it.

29:14.352 --> 29:15.853
Tonight you reclaim
your position as a sous chef.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.456
Do a good job,
he'll trust you more.

29:18.489 --> 29:19.757
Snapper.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.359
Two snappers
at the window.

29:21.392 --> 29:22.727
And now that Hendrick
is focused

29:22.760 --> 29:23.895
On cooking his specials,

29:23.928 --> 29:25.863
at least some entrees
are leaving the kitchen.

29:25.897 --> 29:27.432
Snapper for you.

29:27.465 --> 29:29.233
Oh, there we go.
Look at that.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.866
Thank you.
Mmm.

29:30.866 --> 29:31.002
Thank you.
Mmm.

29:31.035 --> 29:32.937
Yeah, that snapper
is really good.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.505
Very good.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.074
Chef Ramsay's snapper
cooked by Hendrick

29:36.107 --> 29:37.642
Is getting positive reviews.

29:37.675 --> 29:39.677
You cook my fish like this,
I'm stayin' home.

29:39.711 --> 29:41.379
But the original menu

29:41.412 --> 29:42.680
is getting panned.

29:44.615 --> 29:46.017
They nailed
the snapper though.

29:46.050 --> 29:48.653
The snapper
came out perfect.

29:48.686 --> 29:50.088
Always undercooked.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.789
Give me the plate.

29:51.823 --> 29:52.857
There's pink.

29:52.890 --> 29:54.359
He never cooks
the way they want it.

29:55.693 --> 29:57.295
I'm really sorry.

29:57.328 --> 29:58.896
I cannot believe

29:58.930 --> 30:00.498
that you're happy
to serve that.

30:00.531 --> 30:00.866
If they want it
more cooked,

30:00.866 --> 30:01.766
If they want it
more cooked,

30:01.799 --> 30:03.201
why can't you just
cook it?

30:03.234 --> 30:04.902
I don't need to tell you,
big boy,

30:04.936 --> 30:06.337
this is your restaurant.

30:06.371 --> 30:08.339
I'm so sorry.

30:08.373 --> 30:10.541
But now you've overstepped
the mark.

30:10.575 --> 30:12.543
I wouldn't serve that
to my dog.

30:21.686 --> 30:22.920
After another dinner service

30:22.954 --> 30:25.189
filled
with customer complaints,

30:25.223 --> 30:27.725
Chef Ramsay tries
once again

30:27.758 --> 30:29.360
to get through to Andy.

30:29.393 --> 30:32.830
Tonight, honestly,
I was disappointed,

30:32.863 --> 30:36.100
because you proved
yet again

30:36.133 --> 30:37.935
that you
don't give a

30:37.969 --> 30:40.037
about your customers.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.273
You're in
the service industry--

30:42.306 --> 30:44.275
customer relations.

30:44.308 --> 30:45.643
Do you want
to hear anything

30:45.676 --> 30:47.949
I have to say about it
to answer or...?

30:47.949 --> 30:47.979
I have to say about it
to answer or...?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.447
Oh, please.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.182
There's no point.
You're just badgerin' me.

30:51.215 --> 30:53.117
You don't want to hear
anything I say.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.352
Talk to me...

30:54.385 --> 30:55.620
Chef.

30:55.653 --> 30:57.088
My name's Andy.

30:57.121 --> 30:58.723
God.

31:00.057 --> 31:02.860
Isn't one of the problems
that the customers here

31:02.893 --> 31:04.462
are different
than your experience

31:04.495 --> 31:06.030
of customers in Europe?

31:06.063 --> 31:07.632
That is part
of the truth.

31:07.665 --> 31:10.968
People don't here
understand

31:11.002 --> 31:13.404
any form of food
or service

31:13.437 --> 31:14.538
really and truly.

31:14.572 --> 31:16.340
But you can't afford
to be a snob.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.908
I'm not a snob.

31:17.942 --> 31:17.949
You just told me
you know

31:17.949 --> 31:19.410
You just told me
you know

31:19.443 --> 31:20.845
they don't know
what they're talking about.

31:20.878 --> 31:23.814
You just said it
yourself!

31:23.848 --> 31:25.516
You gotta come down
a peg.

31:25.549 --> 31:27.184
I know chefs
that would give

31:27.218 --> 31:29.920
their right arm to have
their wife at the front,

31:29.954 --> 31:31.255
this chef
at their helm,

31:31.289 --> 31:34.925
and a neighborhood,
family-run business.

31:34.959 --> 31:37.828
It's a dream come true
for any chef.

31:37.862 --> 31:40.197
I wasn't  given it.
I earned it.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.399
Good!

31:41.432 --> 31:42.667
It wasn't given to me
on a  plate.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.002
So don't
throw it away!

31:49.473 --> 31:51.309
You're
about to blow it...

31:51.342 --> 31:54.478
completely.

31:54.512 --> 31:56.080
We're at that point.

31:56.113 --> 31:58.149
We're at that point.

31:58.182 --> 32:02.320
You--you've
brought it to light.

32:02.353 --> 32:04.221
You've came and you've told
us and you've showed us,

32:04.255 --> 32:06.724
and you've
brought it to light.

32:06.757 --> 32:09.760
You can win
if you want to.

32:09.794 --> 32:13.664
Andy,
wipe the slate clean

32:13.698 --> 32:15.299
and start again.

32:18.602 --> 32:20.237
That's the best thing
to do.

32:22.373 --> 32:27.378
Tomorrow, together,
all three of us

32:27.411 --> 32:29.780
are gonna re-launch
this restaurant.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.516
Tomorrow is the beginning
of a new chapter.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.819
Wipe the slate clean.

32:34.852 --> 32:37.054
Good night.

32:40.891 --> 32:43.928
With Andy's first real
commitment to change,

32:43.961 --> 32:46.664
Chef Ramsay brings in
his renovation team

32:46.697 --> 32:47.949
to work through the night
to transform Le Bistro.

32:47.949 --> 32:48.899
to work through the night
to transform Le Bistro.

32:53.003 --> 32:54.038
Right, good morning.

32:54.071 --> 32:55.373
Good morning.
How are you?

32:55.406 --> 32:56.974
Good.
How are you?

32:57.007 --> 32:58.242
Great.
Yeah?

32:58.275 --> 32:59.877
Good.
You look great.

32:59.910 --> 33:02.480
Now, Andy,
last night, you told me

33:02.513 --> 33:04.115
you were committed to
changing this restaurant.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.516
Yes?
Yes.

33:05.549 --> 33:07.718
Good, 'cause today's
about change, yes?

33:07.752 --> 33:11.422
This is
your new restaurant.

33:11.455 --> 33:12.957
Have a look
at your new sign.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.260
Oh, my goodness.

33:16.293 --> 33:17.949
Oh, that's fabulous.

33:17.949 --> 33:18.963
Oh, that's fabulous.

33:18.996 --> 33:20.431
Modern,

33:20.464 --> 33:21.432
Legible,

33:21.465 --> 33:22.433
isn't it nice.

33:22.466 --> 33:23.567
I love it.

33:23.601 --> 33:24.835
It's well overdue.
I love the sign.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.771
It seems, like,
easy on the eye.

33:26.804 --> 33:28.305
Ready to go inside
and have a look?

33:28.339 --> 33:31.242
Oh, yes.
Let's go.

33:31.275 --> 33:32.810
Come in.

33:32.843 --> 33:33.878
Mmm!

33:33.911 --> 33:35.212
Oh, beautiful.

33:35.246 --> 33:36.380
Wow!

33:36.414 --> 33:37.581
This is great.

33:37.615 --> 33:38.582
Gone are the booths.

33:38.616 --> 33:41.185
Oh, thank God.

33:41.218 --> 33:42.353
In comes this wonderful

33:42.386 --> 33:44.688
Leather upholstered wall.

33:44.722 --> 33:46.590
Comfy banquette
seating.

33:46.624 --> 33:47.858
Take a seat.

33:47.892 --> 33:47.949
Ahh!

33:47.949 --> 33:49.326
Ahh!

33:49.360 --> 33:52.196
I like this.

33:52.229 --> 33:53.864
Happy?
Happy.

33:53.898 --> 33:55.199
Extremely happy.

33:55.232 --> 33:56.333
It's great.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.568
I'm stuck for words
really,

33:57.601 --> 33:59.203
because it's
a big change for us.

33:59.236 --> 34:00.971
I mean, I've been here
almost nine years.

34:01.005 --> 34:02.473
To see something
in just a few minutes,

34:02.506 --> 34:03.474
it's like a shock.

34:03.507 --> 34:04.708
Wow.

34:04.742 --> 34:05.709
Oh, my goodness.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.077
It's great.

34:07.111 --> 34:09.079
It was great to see Andy

34:09.113 --> 34:10.414
As happy as he is.

34:10.448 --> 34:11.849
I'm so relieved.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.318
I'm really looking forward
to see him in the kitchen.

34:14.351 --> 34:17.488
I think he's truly capable
of change.

34:17.521 --> 34:17.949
This is the beginning
of a new chapter.

34:17.949 --> 34:19.290
This is the beginning
of a new chapter.

34:19.323 --> 34:20.491
It's what we needed,
that's for sure.

34:20.524 --> 34:21.725
This is
what you needed,

34:21.759 --> 34:23.727
and if this doesn't
rekindle that spirit

34:23.761 --> 34:25.362
and that level
of passion,

34:25.396 --> 34:26.697
I don't know
what will.

34:28.566 --> 34:30.568
Chef Ramsay spent
most of re-launch day

34:30.601 --> 34:32.336
Cooking side by side
with Andy.

34:32.369 --> 34:33.370
Got your pan?

34:33.404 --> 34:34.505
Yep. Nice and hot.

34:34.538 --> 34:36.073
What else you got
left to do for service?

34:36.106 --> 34:38.609
I'm just finishing
the, uh, polenta.

34:38.642 --> 34:41.078
Gordon is hoping
these new menu dishes

34:41.111 --> 34:42.947
will be just what
the local community wants.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.181
Right,
how does the food look?

34:44.215 --> 34:45.549
It looks great.
Doesn't it?

34:45.583 --> 34:46.984
Lovely.
The gazpacho.

34:47.017 --> 34:47.949
Perfect for
a hot summer's evening.

34:47.949 --> 34:48.586
Perfect for
a hot summer's evening.

34:48.619 --> 34:49.887
Oysters.
Local oysters.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.622
Extraordinary.
Steamed mussels.

34:51.655 --> 34:53.524
I would order that.
Perfect.

34:53.557 --> 34:55.659
Have a taste.

34:55.693 --> 34:57.294
Entrees,
local snapper.

34:57.328 --> 34:58.429
Big hit last night.

34:58.462 --> 34:59.430
It's remaining
on the menu.

34:59.463 --> 35:00.865
Mmm.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

35:00.898 --> 35:03.200
Veal and foie gras burger.

35:03.234 --> 35:04.635
It's so good.

35:04.668 --> 35:06.170
It's quite straightforward.

35:06.203 --> 35:08.839
And for me, the secret tonight
is the speed.

35:08.873 --> 35:11.308
A little apprehensive.

35:11.342 --> 35:13.077
It's someone else's menu.

35:13.110 --> 35:14.945
But time for change,
and change is better.

35:14.979 --> 35:16.847
Of course we're happy.

35:16.881 --> 35:17.949
That is so good.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.116
That is so good.

35:19.149 --> 35:21.819
Now, everybody,
this is crucial.

35:21.852 --> 35:23.254
Tonight,

35:23.287 --> 35:27.458
each one of your tables
will play host

35:27.491 --> 35:29.360
to a phenomenal
V.I.P.

35:29.393 --> 35:32.096
That is gonna spread
the word beyond belief.

35:32.129 --> 35:33.430
Over there,

35:33.464 --> 35:34.498
the chief of police.

35:34.532 --> 35:35.799
Over there,

35:35.833 --> 35:36.934
the gentleman
is the city commissioner.

35:36.967 --> 35:38.769
Over here,
we have the host

35:38.802 --> 35:41.372
of the top
radio morning show.

35:41.405 --> 35:43.007
There's also the local

35:43.040 --> 35:45.042
renowned food critic
from the newspaper.

35:45.075 --> 35:47.778
This is fabulous.
Thank you.

35:47.811 --> 35:47.949
Pretty excited to be cooking
for the V.I.P.s.

35:47.949 --> 35:50.180
Pretty excited to be cooking
for the V.I.P.s.

35:50.214 --> 35:51.515
Obviously,
they have a big pull,

35:51.549 --> 35:53.217
so I'm looking forward

35:53.250 --> 35:54.752
to hopefully
keeping them happy.

35:54.785 --> 35:56.887
I want to know why
they haven't been here before.

35:59.890 --> 36:01.659
With a completely new
game plan in place...

36:01.692 --> 36:02.960
So when it comes on,

36:02.993 --> 36:04.061
you put it on there,
and you just take it, right?

36:04.094 --> 36:05.863
Absolutely beautiful.

36:05.896 --> 36:08.098
Le Bistro is ready
to open its doors.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.568
And there will be
a local V.I.P.

36:10.601 --> 36:13.103
At virtually every table
in the restaurant.

36:13.137 --> 36:15.272
Oh, I'm so anxious.
I'm glad you're here.

36:15.306 --> 36:16.807
Here you are.
Thank you.

36:16.840 --> 36:17.949
We have a great new
summer menu.

36:17.949 --> 36:18.342
We have a great new
summer menu.

36:18.375 --> 36:19.376
The snapper, beautiful.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.278
Comes with a little
arugula.

36:21.312 --> 36:23.614
Madam?
I'll try the snapper.

36:23.647 --> 36:26.016
I'm gonna have the risotto
on your recommendation.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.551
I'm gonna try your snapper.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.620
I think that sounds
really interesting.

36:29.653 --> 36:31.221
Is Chef Allen happy?

36:31.255 --> 36:32.656
Yeah, yeah.
Who is he?

36:32.690 --> 36:34.692
He's, like, one of the top chefs
in South Florida.

36:34.725 --> 36:37.661
Is he really?
He's very, very famous.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.096
Le Bistro's success tonight

36:39.129 --> 36:41.265
Rests on Andy's ability
to cook...

36:41.298 --> 36:42.533
You and him have got
to connect now, yeah?

36:42.566 --> 36:45.035
And his ability to delegate.

36:45.069 --> 36:47.949
Here we go.

36:47.949 --> 36:48.205
Here we go.

36:48.238 --> 36:49.440
You ready?
Yeah.

36:49.473 --> 36:51.442
Order in.
A fillet, two risotto,

36:51.475 --> 36:52.643
a pork, a snapper,
and a burger.

36:52.676 --> 36:54.445
Here we go, guys.
Come on.

36:54.478 --> 36:56.914
Yes, Hendrick.
Make sure they're nice.

36:56.947 --> 36:57.915
You're gonna need fries
for a burger.

36:57.948 --> 37:00.951
I need that right away.

37:00.985 --> 37:03.687
Come on, come on.
Give me 'em, give me 'em.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.490
Check out.

37:06.523 --> 37:08.058
The burger is for you.

37:08.092 --> 37:09.393
Look at that.

37:09.426 --> 37:11.629
You all enjoy, okay?

37:14.031 --> 37:16.033
Boy, that's really good.

37:16.066 --> 37:17.949
Andy got off
to a good start,

37:17.949 --> 37:18.068
Andy got off
to a good start,

37:18.102 --> 37:20.471
And customers are enjoying
the new menu.

37:20.504 --> 37:21.705
Very good.

37:21.739 --> 37:22.740
Order in.

37:22.773 --> 37:24.541
But back in the kitchen,

37:24.575 --> 37:26.176
Things are starting
to heat up.

37:26.210 --> 37:28.746
Gotta let me know when I can
fire that second snapper.

37:28.779 --> 37:32.149
And Andy is slipping back
to his old ways.

37:32.182 --> 37:33.817
What do we need?

37:33.851 --> 37:35.853
Chicken, risotto, lamb,
burger.

37:35.886 --> 37:36.954
Andy.

37:36.987 --> 37:37.955
Yeah?

37:37.988 --> 37:39.156
You've just gone silent.

37:39.189 --> 37:40.724
Last 15 minutes,
not saying a word.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.092
Well, we're going
as fast as we can.

37:42.126 --> 37:44.662
Andy, don't go back
to the old ways.

37:44.695 --> 37:46.030
All right.

37:46.063 --> 37:47.949
That's all.

37:47.949 --> 37:48.232
That's all.

37:48.265 --> 37:50.034
You are doing table 13.

37:50.067 --> 37:51.301
No, 14,
and 5 has been called.

37:51.335 --> 37:52.469
That's what we're doing.

37:52.503 --> 37:54.204
Don't you dare
go to the wrong table.

37:54.238 --> 37:55.639
Come on.
Hey, come on.

37:55.673 --> 37:58.008
Go, go, go, go, go.

37:59.276 --> 38:00.911
Where's the  snapper?

38:00.944 --> 38:02.913
I need two snapper
on the table, ready or not.

38:02.946 --> 38:03.914
Coming with it, Chef.

38:03.947 --> 38:06.483
Leave it.
I'll do that.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.819
You don't want
to send these, do you?

38:08.852 --> 38:11.588
They can go with these.
They just go in the window.

38:11.622 --> 38:13.590
Eh,.

38:13.624 --> 38:16.026
Andy.
Can we go with these?

38:16.060 --> 38:17.394
Come here, two seconds,
please.

38:17.428 --> 38:17.949
Chef?

38:17.949 --> 38:18.595
Chef?

38:18.629 --> 38:20.264
What the
is going on there?

38:21.999 --> 38:23.500
Come here, you,
a minute.

38:23.534 --> 38:27.004
Come here, come here.
Just 30 seconds.

38:27.037 --> 38:28.739
Out of the way of everybody.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.282
I need two snapper
on the table, ready or not.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.817
It's re-launch night,

38:39.851 --> 38:41.953
And the pressure is starting
to get to Andy.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.288
Come on,
give me the  thing.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.157
They can go with these.
They just go in the window.

38:46.190 --> 38:47.525
Old habits are returning,

38:47.558 --> 38:49.360
And the food preparation
is suffering.

38:49.394 --> 38:51.629
Andy, what the
is going on there?

38:53.564 --> 38:54.699
Come here, you,
a minute.

38:54.732 --> 38:57.635
Just 30 seconds.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.971
Out of the way of everybody,
yeah.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.973
You can't just send.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.111
Why, now,
do we do this?

39:03.111 --> 39:04.308
Why, now,
do we do this?

39:04.342 --> 39:05.710
Sorry, Chef, what do you mean?
Do what?

39:05.743 --> 39:08.846
Why do you have to cook
every  order?

39:08.880 --> 39:11.816
You were just about to serve
two plates of.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.552
One mushy ,
useless piece of ,

39:14.585 --> 39:17.855
crap bit of fish,
and one cooked to.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.724
Why are you looking away?

39:19.757 --> 39:21.893
Talk to me.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.630
There's no excuse, Chef.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.733
You were running around
doing everything.

39:28.766 --> 39:30.668
I don't get it!

39:30.701 --> 39:33.111
Where's the standards?

39:33.111 --> 39:33.604
Where's the standards?

39:33.638 --> 39:35.306
You're right.

39:35.339 --> 39:37.275
I admit that.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.877
You coming here,
big eye-opener.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.647
Gordon Ramsay's a mean,
nasty son of a bitch.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.948
It's a lesson in tough love.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.850
It's a wake-up call,

39:45.883 --> 39:48.753
just that I didn't see it
right till the very end.

39:48.786 --> 39:51.622
We can't come this far now
and flake out at the end, huh?

39:54.459 --> 39:57.028
You know what, no, 'cause
this has to go, and I--

39:57.061 --> 39:58.729
No, it doesn't have to go.
I'm really sorry.

39:58.763 --> 39:59.797
I'm sorry.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.566
I'm dreadfully sorry.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.111
He works his ass off all night,
you cook like you're a star,

40:03.111 --> 40:03.334
He works his ass off all night,
you cook like you're a star,

40:03.367 --> 40:05.002
and then look,
we come to this.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.405
You've got more proudness
in you than that.

40:07.438 --> 40:10.074
Got two snappers
in the oven there, right?

40:10.107 --> 40:11.442
Yeah, that's it.
There you go.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.444
Open up and talk to him,
and teach him, yeah?

40:13.478 --> 40:14.612
Yes, Chef.

40:14.645 --> 40:15.913
You know what you could do
would be nice,

40:15.947 --> 40:17.682
if you put
the spinach on for me.

40:17.715 --> 40:18.816
And if they're on,
all I've got to do

40:18.850 --> 40:19.917
is put them
in the window that way.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.519
Let's go.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.554
This time Gordon has clearly
gotten through to Andy.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.156
He's on top
of the kitchen again,

40:25.189 --> 40:27.325
and food is getting
to the dining room quickly.

40:27.358 --> 40:28.459
Snapper.

40:28.493 --> 40:30.328
It's very good.
That's excellent.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.796
Snapper's delicious.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.111
They did a really good job.

40:33.111 --> 40:34.999
They did a really good job.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.635
Gordon Ramsay
is very insightful.

40:37.668 --> 40:39.370
He knows Andy can cook.

40:39.403 --> 40:41.706
He knows exactly
what Andy needed.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.708
He saw the rut
that Andy was in.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.510
It's been a dream come true.

40:45.543 --> 40:46.744
Thank you very much.

40:46.777 --> 40:47.812
Okay.

40:48.846 --> 40:49.914
Andy, no more customers.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.182
That's it.

40:51.215 --> 40:52.517
Can we break down?
Yeah.

40:52.550 --> 40:53.818
Yeah.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.720
After a successful
re-launch night

40:55.753 --> 40:58.322
And a restaurant
full of V.I.P.s,

40:58.356 --> 41:00.625
Chef Ramsay wants to have
one last word

41:00.658 --> 41:02.393
with the owners.

41:02.426 --> 41:03.111
Here's the good news
about tonight.

41:03.111 --> 41:04.996
Here's the good news
about tonight.

41:05.029 --> 41:07.398
The re-launch...
was a success.

41:07.431 --> 41:09.233
Absolute success.

41:09.267 --> 41:10.668
Not one plate came back.

41:10.701 --> 41:12.436
That is incredible.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.071
You seriously can cook.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.707
But, Andy,

41:16.741 --> 41:18.943
here's my confession
to you.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.312
There's been many times
this week

41:21.345 --> 41:23.214
that you've frustrated
the hell out of me.

41:23.247 --> 41:24.815
You know that, right?
I know.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.117
And honestly,

41:26.150 --> 41:28.953
I finally saw the man
I've been dying to see.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.756
You cook brilliantly well.

41:31.789 --> 41:33.111
You were a different man.
You just got on with it,

41:33.111 --> 41:33.858
You were a different man.
You just got on with it,

41:33.891 --> 41:35.760
delegated,
and pushed them.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.595
I don't say a lot,
I don't smile a lot,

41:37.628 --> 41:38.963
but I'm a thinker.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.097
But I appreciate it,
I really do.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.499
Without you,

41:41.532 --> 41:42.833
it wasn't possible.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.169
We appreciate it.

41:45.202 --> 41:46.837
I was real down in the dumps.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.272
I mean, ready to get
the hell out of here.

41:48.306 --> 41:50.408
But with Gordon Ramsay
being here this week,

41:50.441 --> 41:53.511
it's made me think we can
make a better life

41:53.544 --> 41:55.212
and a better business here.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.581
I just can't wait to get

41:56.614 --> 41:58.516
into this new restaurant
that we have.

41:58.549 --> 42:01.953
What a long way
we have come this week.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.111
Yeah.

42:03.111 --> 42:03.120
Yeah.

42:03.154 --> 42:05.623
Take care of that
stubborn mule.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.158
Yes?

42:07.191 --> 42:09.260
Thank you.

42:09.293 --> 42:11.729
Well done.
Good job.

42:11.762 --> 42:13.164
Good night.
Good night.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.535
Up until tonight's
dinner service,

42:17.568 --> 42:19.370
I really didn't know
if Andy could make this work,

42:19.403 --> 42:21.706
and honestly,
I'm still not convinced.

42:21.739 --> 42:24.008
He's got everything here to make
this place a huge success.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.010
I just hope
that his own stubbornness

42:26.043 --> 42:28.012
doesn't get in his way.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.548
Unbelievable.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.111
In the months that followed,

42:33.111 --> 42:33.818
In the months that followed,

42:33.851 --> 42:36.754
Andy and Elin continued to
embrace Chef Ramsay's changes.

42:36.787 --> 42:38.155
Another one.
Another fillet.

42:38.189 --> 42:39.957
Snapper fillet,
risotto away.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.892
Le Bistro's food
is light and fresh.

42:41.926 --> 42:43.561
And customers
are thrilled.

42:43.594 --> 42:44.829
It's delicious.
Yeah, very good.

42:44.862 --> 42:45.930
Okay, well, I will
let the chef know.

42:45.963 --> 42:47.531
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.433
And there's no better
indication of that...

42:49.467 --> 42:50.801
Hello!
Hi!

42:50.835 --> 42:53.738
Than Le Bistro's
repeat business.

42:53.771 --> 42:55.439
I think Gordon Ramsay saw

42:55.473 --> 42:57.174
that I was just doing
everything, doing too much,

42:57.208 --> 42:58.743
and it was holding me back.

42:58.776 --> 43:00.778
I'm really hoping
to progress and move on

43:00.811 --> 43:02.413
and get bigger and better.

43:02.446 --> 43:03.111
Gordon Ramsay's welcome here
anytime.

43:03.111 --> 43:04.281
Gordon Ramsay's welcome here
anytime.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.484
Here's to Le Bistro
and new beginnings.

43:06.517 --> 43:07.852
Thank you.
