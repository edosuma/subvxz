[Geralt] Redanian crowns.

00:15.750 --> 00:16.958
[Nenneke] Melitele,

00:18.791 --> 00:21.250
I have failed you.

00:22.291 --> 00:23.416
Forgive me.

00:24.208 --> 00:25.916
These men were after Ciri.

00:30.416 --> 00:31.750
[sighs] My weapons?

00:34.208 --> 00:36.500
I need to find her.

00:37.208 --> 00:40.791
You need to let me
take care of your wound.

00:48.208 --> 00:49.375
Hmm.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.458
How did it break?

00:56.333 --> 00:57.791
She does that to things.

00:59.666 --> 01:02.833
If what you say
about that girl's power is true,

01:04.500 --> 01:06.291
you can't help her.

01:06.375 --> 01:07.875
Ah, I'll find my own weapons.

01:07.958 --> 01:09.666
What I mean is,

01:10.375 --> 01:13.708
Ciri needs more than you can give her now.

01:13.791 --> 01:15.708
I swore to protect her!

01:17.791 --> 01:18.666
Nenneke,

01:19.958 --> 01:21.958
I will not sit back and wait

01:22.041 --> 01:25.166
for something worse than a rogue mage
and his agenda to happen to her.

01:25.250 --> 01:30.458
Do you believe
Yennefer means to harm the girl?

01:32.791 --> 01:36.458
I wish Yennefer knew
of the balance you spoke of.

01:38.208 --> 01:40.041
More than you know, I wish it.

01:42.708 --> 01:45.458
But I learned my lesson
about Yennefer and wishes.

01:46.291 --> 01:49.791
Sometimes, we assume the worst

01:50.583 --> 01:53.416
because we fear to hope.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.458
I need you to open a portal.

02:17.750 --> 02:18.583
[whispers] Zola.

02:19.250 --> 02:20.458
You've been here before?

02:21.875 --> 02:25.416
The woman who lives here,
she took me in. She was kind to me.

02:26.666 --> 02:27.541
The dream,

02:28.208 --> 02:29.750
when I first heard your name,

02:29.833 --> 02:31.333
was in this house.

02:32.041 --> 02:33.583
Same day Geralt found me.

02:34.541 --> 02:37.000
That's why the portal took us here.
It felt safe.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.791
-[fly buzzing]
-[horse neighing]

02:38.875 --> 02:40.791
Should I try again? Get us back to Geralt?

02:40.875 --> 02:42.833
No. That was impressive, but no.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.916
-Let's keep our insides on the inside.
-[neighing]

02:46.875 --> 02:49.333
-Where are they now?
-They must have left.

02:50.666 --> 02:53.875
The battle at Sodden was close.
Maybe they fled.

02:53.958 --> 02:55.708
-Maybe.
-[flies buzzing]

[sniffles]

03:15.625 --> 03:16.583
No. [sobs]

03:19.375 --> 03:20.208
No.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.208
I left months ago.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.708
Nobody knew I was here. Nobody.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.833
Nobody even knows I'm alive.

03:34.125 --> 03:35.083
Except…

03:38.166 --> 03:39.750
Do you think he works for Nilfgaard?

03:42.375 --> 03:43.875
What if he's got Geralt?

03:45.291 --> 03:46.666
Geralt's strong.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.208
He'll have held his own.

03:48.291 --> 03:49.833
You don't sound sure, Yennefer.

03:50.416 --> 03:52.458
If Nilfgaard's got him, if…

03:53.875 --> 03:57.000
they'll have kept Geralt alive
to help track you down.

03:57.083 --> 03:59.708
-They'll hold him to lure you there.
-Where?

04:01.791 --> 04:03.458
Their nearest outpost.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.583
Cintra.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.916
I've fantasized about going back.

04:15.833 --> 04:19.500
Finding the Black Knight
and shoving my sword through his throat

04:20.541 --> 04:22.958
until his feathers are soaked in blood.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.791
Geralt wouldn't want me to go.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.916
He'd want me to avoid danger.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.458
Geralt will hold out as long as he can.

04:43.791 --> 04:45.833
We must go to Cintra. Together.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.000
[neighing]

04:50.458 --> 04:51.875
Yennefer, wait!

04:53.750 --> 04:56.166
You've seen what happens
to people who try to help me.

04:56.916 --> 04:58.250
I have to go alone.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.375
Ciri, I'm not leaving your side.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.333
If anything were to happen to you,
Geralt would never forgive me.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.375
We must hurry.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.708
[old woman] That's right.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.250
Bring her.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.333
[cackling laughter]

05:22.375 --> 05:24.750

06:09.833 --> 06:11.000
You're my partner.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.916
You can tell me if something's wrong.

06:17.458 --> 06:21.500
Our new position of authority
means new responsibilities.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.125
I don't want to burden you.

06:23.625 --> 06:27.916
Our new position of authority
doesn't change the fact that I love you.

06:30.125 --> 06:32.041
Your pain is my pain.

06:35.708 --> 06:37.416
We have an unexpected visitor.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.708
Hmm. Who?

06:43.166 --> 06:44.291
Dijkstra.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.458
Redania must be up to something.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.250
[sheep bleating]

06:50.333 --> 06:53.208
[Fringilla] How can you be sure
that Redania has implanted a spy?

06:53.291 --> 06:55.333
[Hake] Because it's what
I would have done.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.041
First it was elves, then half-breeds.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.791
Now spouses, sympathizers,

06:59.875 --> 07:02.541
pouring through our gates daily,
virtually unchecked.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.541
A gift-wrapped opportunity
courtesy of you.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.875
We need to rebuild our army.

07:07.541 --> 07:09.166
Yes. I agree.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.875
But let's do it wisely.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.791
If we bring outsiders into the fold,
we must ensure their allegiance.

07:14.875 --> 07:17.625
Half of the elves did not muster
for training this morning.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.416
The celebration of the child's birth
went late into the night.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.208
Oh, grand. We're larding up with pointies

07:22.291 --> 07:24.291
who can't hold their drink
or can't follow orders.

07:24.375 --> 07:27.666
-I will talk to them.
-You are not their commander.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.416
[horses neighing]

07:33.125 --> 07:34.875

07:44.250 --> 07:46.291

they know this is unsustainable,

07:46.375 --> 07:47.625

I will not have him met
with chaos and insubordination.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.250
I will handle it.

the generals I am doubting the most?

07:59.583 --> 08:01.458
Should I count you among them, Cahir?

08:01.541 --> 08:03.541
Everything I do
is in service of the White Flame.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.125

I would be telling you all of this?

What would you have me do?

08:22.250 --> 08:25.583
If the elves refuse to serve,
let me deal with them.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.791

08:29.666 --> 08:30.875

13:57.291 --> 14:00.500
I trust you're unaware that
your fighters failed to show this morning.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.791
-I heard.
-Well, then I trust

14:02.875 --> 14:05.083
you will make sure it never happens again.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.291
One day is a hangover,

14:07.833 --> 14:09.666
two is sedition.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.791
-Many of us have had a change of heart.
-Then you change it back.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.416
I never intended to fight for Nilfgaard.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.416
Francesca convinced me,

14:18.500 --> 14:21.625
but now she has given me
a far better reason

14:21.708 --> 14:23.416
-not to fight.
-[baby cooing]

14:24.000 --> 14:25.708
It's time for us to rebuild.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.166
To grow strong again.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.458
Have you forgotten
who brought that child into the world?

14:32.041 --> 14:34.583
-Who made Cintra safe for the elves?
-We're grateful.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.000
It's time for us now
to add to our numbers,

14:37.083 --> 14:38.750
not to die in someone else's war.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.958
Our war is your war.

14:41.041 --> 14:44.916
[Francesca] Fringilla,
as a friend, I must ask,

14:45.500 --> 14:47.458
are these your words or Cahir's?

14:48.875 --> 14:50.000
Francesca…

15:01.125 --> 15:03.166
The bargain we struck in that hut,

15:04.583 --> 15:05.833
it is working.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.791
You have your baby…

15:12.833 --> 15:14.333
and I have Emhyr's favor.

15:15.833 --> 15:17.291
It can all stay this way

15:17.958 --> 15:18.791
if…

15:19.791 --> 15:21.458
our bond remains strong.

15:23.416 --> 15:25.916
As I said, we are friends.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.375
I value the bond we have.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.291
But family,

15:32.541 --> 15:33.416
blood,

15:34.958 --> 15:39.500
that's the only bond that can't be broken,
and that's the one I must protect.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.375
[[snorts softly]

15:56.666 --> 15:59.041
[Dijkstra] I thought you'd want
to hear the news right away.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.958
[Stregobor] It's even worse than I feared.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.833
Not just an elven baby,
but one born to a mage.

16:04.708 --> 16:07.791
Only you could see a threat
where everyone else sees a baby.

16:07.875 --> 16:10.250
Not all of us have
your soft spot for elves, Tissaia.

16:10.333 --> 16:13.333
She's a co-chair on this council.
She doesn't have soft spots.

16:13.416 --> 16:14.500
Well, you'd know.

16:15.125 --> 16:19.250
Besides, it's not just a baby.
It's a-- it's a symbol. A beacon.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.958
Not to mention a potential enemy
who'll live for centuries…

16:23.041 --> 16:25.541
[Artorius] Who is currently aligned
with our other enemy.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.625
We could be tangled in a war again
before we know it.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.416
Unlike your tenure, Artorius,

16:29.500 --> 16:32.166
we no longer act
on unfounded prejudice and rumors.

16:32.250 --> 16:35.000
Which is why
I find it so very hard to believe

16:35.083 --> 16:37.791
that you came here simply to share gossip.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.625
[chuckles] Well, in my line of work,

16:42.125 --> 16:44.250
today's gossip is next month's news.

16:44.750 --> 16:48.625
For instance, I heard that one
of your former students has returned.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.833
Foltest's mage?

16:53.791 --> 16:55.750
Triss Merigold, is it?

16:56.250 --> 16:57.541
Triss is here?

16:57.625 --> 16:59.541
She fell ill in Temeria

17:00.750 --> 17:02.541
and has come here to recover.

17:02.625 --> 17:03.625
Oh. Mmm.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.958
Yes, there are tales of many
a strange stomach ailment this spring.

17:08.041 --> 17:10.666
All of them coming
from up in the mountains, though.

17:13.708 --> 17:14.875
Give her my best.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.625
Oh, I will.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.375
As long as you give King Vizimir ours

17:19.458 --> 17:22.291
for this distracting information
about the baby.

17:28.625 --> 17:30.291
Will there be anything else,

17:31.041 --> 17:32.083
Dijkstra?

17:33.125 --> 17:34.291
[caws]

17:35.416 --> 17:39.333
As soon as Cirilla disappeared,
I knew my chance had passed so I fled.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.208
Fled?

17:41.708 --> 17:44.000
I was aided, of course.

17:44.625 --> 17:47.583
I didn't have the time nor strength left
to open a portal myself.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.333
Yes, well…

17:50.708 --> 17:52.458
he hasn't been here in days.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.000
He said he'd come.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.625
-And you said I'd get to meet him.
-[cawing]

17:57.708 --> 17:59.541
If you brought the girl.

18:00.375 --> 18:01.416
This is on you.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.333
Or it's on you.

18:08.166 --> 18:11.083
Perhaps you don't have
as much sway with him as you imagined.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.208
No, it's part of his plan.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.083
The theatrics.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.000
[sighing] The distraction.

18:27.708 --> 18:28.541
[caws]

18:34.041 --> 18:35.916
Fine, you little lunatic, you can have it.

18:37.791 --> 18:39.458
Go on, run your damn test.

18:39.541 --> 18:42.666
If it works, your master will be here
in an instant, I assure you.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.125
Do you think?

18:57.666 --> 18:59.083
Blood tracing is simple.

18:59.583 --> 19:02.166
Mages have been practicing it
for centuries.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.750
Though, I admit,

19:04.250 --> 19:06.041
my test subjects are normally…

19:06.125 --> 19:07.041
Dead.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.458
-Precisely.
-[cawing]

19:12.416 --> 19:13.791
[sighs]

19:28.041 --> 19:29.083
[loud cawing]

19:29.166 --> 19:30.583
[Lydia gasps]

19:30.666 --> 19:32.041
-[thud]
-[Lydia groans]

19:32.666 --> 19:33.916
-[gasps]
-[kicking]

19:34.541 --> 19:36.541
-[screaming]
-[thumping]

19:38.000 --> 19:39.375
[Jaskier] Oh, blessed nectar.

19:39.458 --> 19:41.666
I have not washed in quite some time,

19:41.750 --> 19:44.625
and I'm beginning to smell
like a Nilfgaardian's ballsack.

19:44.708 --> 19:47.250
So if you'll excuse me, hold this.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.125
I have been looking forward to this!

19:55.125 --> 19:56.083
God, it's cold!

19:56.166 --> 19:57.583
Whew!

19:57.666 --> 20:01.000
Whew, you could hang portraits
off my nipples right now.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.750
You're the expert.
How do you get blood out?

20:03.833 --> 20:05.875
What was Yennefer doing in Oxenfurt?

20:06.458 --> 20:08.833
-Well, she was saving my life.
-What?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.541
Yeah, I know. I'm as surprised as you are,

20:11.625 --> 20:15.625
seeing as I trust her about as far
as I could wring her stringy, weird neck,

20:15.708 --> 20:16.583
but it's true.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.916
She risked her life for me.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.250
I always knew
there was some deeper feeling for me

20:21.333 --> 20:24.125
beneath all that rage and… hair.

20:24.208 --> 20:26.625
-She's got a lot of hair, that woman.
-What was her angle?

20:26.708 --> 20:28.416
Not an attractive one.

20:29.541 --> 20:32.500
[grunts] She was on the run.
She'd lost her magic.

20:33.041 --> 20:34.416
She was almost tolerable.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.791
-She lost her magic?
-Yeah, I know!

20:36.875 --> 20:38.541
It was great! [chuckles]

20:39.583 --> 20:40.750
Unless she was lying.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.500
Only just realizing now
she might have been lying.

20:44.583 --> 20:48.583
[echoing] Fuck! Oh, Jaskier, you moron!

20:49.125 --> 20:50.583
Because if she wasn't lying,

20:50.666 --> 20:53.625
then how did she magically disappear
into thin air

20:53.708 --> 20:55.375
when she was imprisoned
in the whorehouse?

20:55.458 --> 20:57.416
Tell me exactly what happened in Oxenfurt.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.083
When the Redanian guards grabbed her,

20:59.166 --> 21:01.958
she muttered something about forests,

21:02.041 --> 21:05.333
and mothers, and huts,

21:05.416 --> 21:07.500
and then she just
sort of disappeared,

21:07.583 --> 21:09.958
-so--
-"Turn your back to the forest, hut, hut"?

21:10.458 --> 21:13.458
"Turn your front to me, hut, hut."
Yeah, that's what she said.

21:16.166 --> 21:18.541
She's in league with the Deathless Mother.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.458
Well, she sounds like a hoot.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.041
Who is the Deathless Mother, Geralt?

21:24.125 --> 21:25.250
Voleth Meir.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.291
The first witchers
were hired to imprison her.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.166
They entombed her in her hut.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.000
But someone's gone and opened up the door.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.166
That someone being…

21:37.791 --> 21:39.625
-She wouldn't.
-She would.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.375
What? Sacrifice your Child Surprise
to get her magic back?

21:43.458 --> 21:46.041
You bet your bloated biceps she would.

21:46.625 --> 21:49.583
Voleth Meir is a demon that feeds on pain.

21:50.416 --> 21:51.916
[birds calling]

21:56.583 --> 21:58.083
We need to go to Cintra.

21:58.166 --> 21:59.916
-Why? What's in Cintra?
-[twig snaps]

22:00.000 --> 22:00.916
Oh!

22:04.000 --> 22:06.666
Someone really didn't like my shirt!
[chuckles]

22:06.750 --> 22:08.208
[cackling]

22:08.291 --> 22:10.083
[horse neighing]

22:10.791 --> 22:11.958
[Geralt] Yarpen Zigrin.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.916
Your aim's gone to shit.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.833
And if it isn't the White fuckin' Wolf
and the big fuckin' mouth.

22:22.291 --> 22:24.875
Put your weapons down, numpty arseholes.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.250
This is an old friend.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.958
Uh, friends. Plural.

22:29.041 --> 22:31.041
-Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount--
-Yeah!

22:31.541 --> 22:32.458
I know.

22:33.166 --> 22:34.125
Right, yeah.

22:34.208 --> 22:38.291
What are you doin' out here in the middle
of east bloody nowhere, you warlock?

22:38.375 --> 22:40.583
[Geralt] I could ask you
the same question.

22:40.666 --> 22:43.875
Aren't you supposed to be the lord
of a vassal state in Caingorn?

22:43.958 --> 22:45.083
[Yarpen] Ach.

22:45.166 --> 22:47.583
Lording's for peacocks and pissants.

22:47.666 --> 22:50.583
We run the roads for Henselt now.
Protect his convoys.

22:50.666 --> 22:51.666
Pays better.

22:52.541 --> 22:55.583
-You remember my men.
-Of course. Good to see you all again.

22:56.791 --> 22:59.416
I have absolutely no recollection
of any of these people.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.958
-[man scoffs] Wanker.
-[muttering]

23:01.041 --> 23:02.458
Where's Lucas Corto?

23:03.083 --> 23:05.208
-He owes me money.
-[Yarpen] You've got a good memory.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.333
Lucas Corto got married,
settled down in Mahakam,

23:08.416 --> 23:10.833
and dropped out of the company,
the stupid oaf.

23:13.958 --> 23:15.583
You ain't looking
to join a crew yourself?

23:16.250 --> 23:19.791
Be happy to have you as our sixth.
Even if you do smell like shite.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.625
I can't right now, Yarpen.

23:24.041 --> 23:26.125
And I need a horse. I'll, uh…

23:27.083 --> 23:29.541
pay you double with interest
once I find some coin.

23:30.125 --> 23:32.375
Normally, I'd tell you
to shit twice and die,

23:33.041 --> 23:36.750
but we're on the Trail,
and you never refuse help on the Trail.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.250
This mount's too big for us lot, anyway.

23:41.416 --> 23:43.291
What's the mission,
if you don't mind me asking?

23:43.375 --> 23:44.333
I do.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.000
The secret kind.

23:49.916 --> 23:51.166
My favorite.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.625
[snorts]

23:57.833 --> 23:59.458
You're not my usual type.

24:02.416 --> 24:03.416
But you'll do.

24:03.916 --> 24:06.541
[Yarpen] Come on, boys! The king can wait.

24:07.125 --> 24:09.833
We're goin' on an adventure! [laughs]

24:24.083 --> 24:25.333
The bridge is out.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.666
Where else can we cross?

24:37.750 --> 24:39.875
It's half a day's ride.
We don't have time.

24:43.458 --> 24:47.125
[Yennefer] We'll have to leave
the horses behind. But there is a way.

24:48.041 --> 24:49.416
Lesson number two.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.791
Let's see what your Chaos can do.

24:57.541 --> 25:00.625
You can either be too strong to fail
or too weak to try.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.125
You can do this, Ciri.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.416
I believe in you.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.041
Repeat after me.

25:19.416 --> 25:22.458
[speaking in Elder]

25:23.541 --> 25:26.833
[repeats words]

25:29.500 --> 25:31.416
[Yennefer speaking in Elder]

25:34.000 --> 25:35.541
[repeats words]

25:45.125 --> 25:47.000
[Yennefer] That's it! Now repeat.

25:47.833 --> 25:49.500
[repeats spell]

25:59.375 --> 26:02.166
Don't strain.
Trust your power to do the work.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.291
That's enough.

26:10.375 --> 26:11.416
I can do it.

26:12.125 --> 26:15.041
-We'll find another route.
-[groans]

26:15.958 --> 26:18.250
-You're going to hurt yourself!
-[rumbling]

26:21.875 --> 26:23.916
Ciri, stop! Stop!

26:24.000 --> 26:25.375
[whimpers and yells]

26:26.083 --> 26:27.416
Fuck! Fuck!

26:28.375 --> 26:31.000
-[screams] Fuck!
-[intense rumbling]

26:31.083 --> 26:32.291
[crashing]

26:32.375 --> 26:34.083
[whooshing]

26:34.875 --> 26:36.333
[rumbling fades]

26:40.833 --> 26:42.625
Well, that's one way of doing it.

26:46.958 --> 26:49.041
I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.

26:51.291 --> 26:53.166
When you have power like this,

26:53.708 --> 26:55.208
never apologize.

27:13.083 --> 27:15.416
[birdsong]

27:22.375 --> 27:23.583
[Triss] Do you hear them?

27:25.125 --> 27:27.625
It's wood thrush, calling to each other.

27:29.125 --> 27:32.291
When I first went to court,
I was so homesick for that sound.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.833
You used to put seeds on your sill
when you were younger.

27:35.916 --> 27:39.041
Tried to catch them for pets.
Succeeded once.

27:39.125 --> 27:42.541
I didn't know whose neck
you'd wring first, mine or the bird's.

27:42.625 --> 27:43.666
[chuckles]

27:45.416 --> 27:48.875
[Tissaia] When you were called away,
I didn't realize what you'd be doing.

27:49.541 --> 27:50.750
You should know

27:51.375 --> 27:53.291
I saw Cirilla of Cintra at Sodden.

27:54.666 --> 27:55.500
What?

27:55.583 --> 27:58.250
She was there
with the white-haired witcher.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.458
I didn't know who she was,
but now, of course, it makes sense.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.291
-They were looking for--
-Yennefer.

28:06.375 --> 28:07.250
Yes.

28:08.458 --> 28:10.166
They believed she was dead.

28:23.208 --> 28:25.291
The information you told me about Ciri,

28:25.791 --> 28:28.500
about what you saw
when you performed the Dol Durza,

28:29.000 --> 28:30.083
who else knows?

28:30.166 --> 28:31.875
The other witchers and you.

28:31.958 --> 28:33.833
I don't trust anyone else.

28:33.916 --> 28:35.000
Triss!

28:35.083 --> 28:37.833
No, no, I said I would call you
when she was ready.

28:37.916 --> 28:41.250
I need to know everything
about the girl. Now.

28:42.208 --> 28:43.083
You told him.

28:43.166 --> 28:47.208
This knowledge, it cannot be ours alone.
There is too much at stake.

28:47.291 --> 28:49.458
Look, this is important.

28:50.833 --> 28:53.708
I need you to tell me everything, Triss.

28:54.958 --> 28:56.125
[gasps]

28:56.750 --> 28:57.583
Triss.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.625
She wasn't ready.

29:08.208 --> 29:10.625
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.666
This isn't a game, Tissaia.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.250
If what she says is true,

29:15.333 --> 29:20.166
this child has the potential
to end all war.

29:20.750 --> 29:21.666
Forever.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.583
Unless she falls into the wrong hands.

29:25.666 --> 29:29.000
And if that happens,
the consequences will be ours to own.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.000
Well, damn the consequences.

29:31.083 --> 29:33.500
Because I made a promise to Triss,

29:33.583 --> 29:37.583
and I will not continue
to put my girls at risk unnecessarily.

29:37.666 --> 29:40.541
[yells] I wouldn't ask you to
if it wasn't necessary!

29:44.458 --> 29:45.625
[sighs]

29:56.000 --> 29:57.500
[sighs]

29:58.916 --> 30:00.458
[sighs]

30:00.541 --> 30:03.916
I have always considered you
my equal partner.

30:05.833 --> 30:07.791
My most trusted confidante.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.791
I wish I could prove to you

30:12.625 --> 30:14.416
that I'm worthy of the same.

30:26.166 --> 30:27.791
[portal opens]

30:29.208 --> 30:30.333
[portal closes]

30:30.416 --> 30:32.125
You dare show your face here.

30:33.250 --> 30:35.625
After lying to the conclave
and attacking us at Sodden!

30:35.708 --> 30:37.583
My portal has no doubt set off alarms.

30:38.416 --> 30:40.833
-I don't have much time.
-So get on with it.

30:40.916 --> 30:43.375
What water does Nilfgaard want you
to carry for them this time?

30:43.458 --> 30:44.666
I'm not here for them.

30:44.750 --> 30:45.750
Or as a mage.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.583
Just as your niece.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.583
I may need to leave Nilfgaard.

30:52.541 --> 30:53.500
And quickly.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
What's changed?

30:58.625 --> 31:01.708
An emperor arriving tomorrow
with great expectations I--

31:02.708 --> 31:07.541
I brought in the elves to fight for us,
but they… have had a change of heart.

31:08.958 --> 31:11.833
So the elven birth has helped our cause,
not threatened it.

31:13.333 --> 31:14.833
Tissaia was right.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.625
-I care not for the Brotherhood's polit--
-And yet I do.

31:20.125 --> 31:24.625
Triss Merigold returns suddenly,
without explanation.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.916
-Do you know anything about that?
-No.

31:29.625 --> 31:30.458
Uncle,

31:32.416 --> 31:33.500
you are my blood.

31:36.291 --> 31:39.375
And that is a bond
that is stronger than all others.

31:39.458 --> 31:41.000
[sighs]

31:44.541 --> 31:45.416
Please.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.208
I'm asking you for help.

31:52.041 --> 31:53.708
For once, will you give it?

31:56.916 --> 32:00.833
I should have stood up for you
that night at the ball in Aretuza.

32:02.416 --> 32:03.416
I'm sorry.

32:04.958 --> 32:07.000
Let's be honest.
Whatever is brewing out there,

32:07.083 --> 32:09.375
the Brotherhood needs
reinforcements in here.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.125
If you were to return,

32:12.208 --> 32:14.166
you'd need to plead your case.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.083
Apologize, as well.

32:19.041 --> 32:20.708
For aligning with Nilfgaard?

32:21.208 --> 32:22.041
Of course.

32:22.125 --> 32:25.916
For believing that you could have
any impact there at all, my dear.

32:27.208 --> 32:29.375
There are those who are
obsessed with finding power,

32:29.458 --> 32:31.708
and those who know their place.

32:31.791 --> 32:34.708
You know which one you are, thank gods.

32:35.416 --> 32:37.791
You wouldn't have come back here
if you didn't.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.208
[sighs]

32:43.416 --> 32:45.250
[bell ringing]

32:49.250 --> 32:50.666
[Dara breathing shakily]

32:51.208 --> 32:52.666
Of course I'm nervous.

32:53.250 --> 32:57.000
As a child,
I watched Cintran soldiers murder my kind.

32:57.583 --> 32:59.458
Now I'm watching Nilfgaard do the same.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.333
Only now I'm complicit.

33:02.416 --> 33:04.333
-[man shouts]
-[horse neighs]

33:05.000 --> 33:06.458
They're looking for me.

33:07.166 --> 33:10.708
-[cooing]
-Elves are dying because I'm here. Spying.

33:13.416 --> 33:15.125
But it's more than that.

33:15.916 --> 33:16.916
Last night,

33:18.416 --> 33:20.791
seeing my people sing and dance,

33:20.875 --> 33:23.666
seeing the baby in her mother's arms…

33:25.125 --> 33:26.333
[sighs]

33:27.500 --> 33:29.083
I don't care about Redania.

33:29.583 --> 33:30.916
Or Cirilla of Cintra.

33:31.708 --> 33:33.208
They can have each other.

33:33.791 --> 33:34.750
From here on out,

33:34.833 --> 33:37.708
I want to focus
on keeping that elven hope alive.

33:41.416 --> 33:42.791
Tell Dijkstra I'm done.

33:44.958 --> 33:47.166
[Hake] I've had my doubts
about Fringilla all along.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.166
[dog barks]

33:48.833 --> 33:52.166
Emhyr letting a mage give us orders? Nah.

33:54.083 --> 33:57.333
The White Flame will take one look
at this disaster and reset the table.

33:57.833 --> 34:01.125
If her head's still on her shoulders
by morning, I'll be shocked.

34:05.791 --> 34:07.166
You're falling behind.

34:08.208 --> 34:09.041
What's the matter?

34:09.750 --> 34:11.958
We're supposed to be on the same side.

34:12.041 --> 34:14.208
Searching for Princess Cirilla.

34:16.625 --> 34:17.666
She's alive.

34:18.458 --> 34:19.458
I know it.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.041
[Hake] And we'll find her.

34:23.916 --> 34:26.166
As soon as we unload
Fringilla's dead weight.

34:29.291 --> 34:32.041
If we don't,
all our heads will be on the ch--

34:32.125 --> 34:34.375
-[crackling]
-[choking and grunting]

34:36.208 --> 34:38.208
[dog barks and whimpers]

34:40.166 --> 34:44.458
I have so much resentment
for my Aretuzan training

34:44.541 --> 34:46.583
that I forget…

34:48.333 --> 34:50.541
-there were bright spots.
-[muffled groaning]

34:51.500 --> 34:53.458
Botany, for example.

34:55.375 --> 34:58.916
Where else could I have learned
the paralytic qualities of nightshade?

35:00.833 --> 35:03.333
Or how to mask it in a glass of mead?

35:08.208 --> 35:10.041
My most valuable lesson, though…

35:10.125 --> 35:11.000
[Cahir whimpers]

35:11.083 --> 35:12.541
…came on my last night there.

35:13.958 --> 35:16.875
When Yennefer of Vengerberg

35:18.416 --> 35:21.458
stole the seat of Aedirn
to which I was entitled.

35:21.541 --> 35:24.625
And that taught me

35:25.583 --> 35:27.958
whenever a lesser light
tries to steal what is yours…

35:28.041 --> 35:31.666
[grunting] …you do not sit there
and take it.

35:31.750 --> 35:34.333
[Voleth Meir cackling]

35:34.416 --> 35:35.833
[sighs]

35:35.916 --> 35:37.750
[Voleth Meir] Your power…

35:42.333 --> 35:43.250
seize it.

35:43.333 --> 35:44.583
[Fringilla grunts]

35:44.666 --> 35:46.083
[Voleth Meir laughing]

35:51.041 --> 35:52.375
You must do…

35:52.458 --> 35:54.041
[Voleth Meir laughing]

35:54.125 --> 35:55.000
…whatever…

35:56.208 --> 35:57.291
is required…

36:00.166 --> 36:02.333
[Voleth Meir] Not as a meek sycophant…

36:02.416 --> 36:03.625
[echoing] …sycophant…

36:04.208 --> 36:05.083
[laughing]

36:05.166 --> 36:06.208
[Fringilla sighs]

36:09.375 --> 36:10.458
…to hold on…

36:13.458 --> 36:14.833
to what you've earned.

36:15.791 --> 36:17.833
-[choking]
-[Voleth Meir laughing]

36:21.041 --> 36:22.916
[laughter echoing]

36:23.708 --> 36:25.583
How did it come to this, Cahir?

36:28.833 --> 36:29.833
I may never know

36:30.416 --> 36:32.875
if you were planning
to overthrow me or not.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.500
But one thing I do know.

36:36.375 --> 36:39.791
I am never going back to that dungeon.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.333
-I would much rather…
-[whimpers]

36:44.916 --> 36:46.666
…put this knife in my own eye

36:47.375 --> 36:48.375
and end it all.

36:56.125 --> 36:58.916
Emhyr needs to hear of the treachery
I just uncovered.

37:00.708 --> 37:03.291
And he needs
the general that he trusts most

37:04.416 --> 37:06.208
to tell him I was justified.

37:08.666 --> 37:10.416
So when he arrives tomorrow…

37:13.208 --> 37:14.083
rave.

37:22.250 --> 37:24.250
[Voleth Meir cackling]

37:24.791 --> 37:26.791
[flames roaring]

37:27.458 --> 37:29.208
[laughing]

37:30.583 --> 37:32.333
[laughter fading]

37:33.750 --> 37:35.333
[screeching]

37:37.041 --> 37:38.125
[Dijkstra] Hmm.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.000
[chuckles]

37:42.000 --> 37:42.833
[coos]

37:42.916 --> 37:45.750
Our little spy Dara
has had a change of heart.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.000
We have all the information we need.

37:52.458 --> 37:54.625
The girl gives you
the rightful claim to Cintra.

37:55.916 --> 37:59.291
That makes Redania the most powerful
kingdom on the Continent.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.375
Or Nilfgaard, if they get her first.

38:02.833 --> 38:04.333
What about Aretuza?

38:05.166 --> 38:06.583
Didn't you go there for…

38:07.583 --> 38:09.000
-something?
-Hmm.

38:09.708 --> 38:14.083
There are some… unknown variables
in Aretuza.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.916
Tissaia knows of the girl's existence.
I'm certain.

38:18.625 --> 38:21.208
But she keeps the information
very close to her chest.

38:21.708 --> 38:23.083
Even from Vilgefortz,

38:23.166 --> 38:26.541
whom she helped install
and, uh… obviously cares for. [scoffs]

38:27.500 --> 38:30.041
-Who?
-The new leader of the Brotherhood.

38:30.125 --> 38:32.250
How long that will last
is anybody's guess.

38:32.333 --> 38:35.500
Tissaia acts detached,

38:35.583 --> 38:39.166
but she lets relationships
cloud her judgment.

38:40.041 --> 38:43.083
Stregobor will take advantage of that.
If I were a betting man--

38:43.166 --> 38:44.000
If…

38:45.916 --> 38:49.333
you were a betting man,
you'd be betting with my money.

38:52.250 --> 38:54.625
I pay you to solve problems, Dijkstra,

38:55.250 --> 38:58.291
not fill my head with piling bad news.

38:58.375 --> 39:01.333
Not bad news, my lord.

39:01.416 --> 39:02.458
Bedlam.

39:03.416 --> 39:06.250
And if our goal is
to destabilize the Continent,

39:06.333 --> 39:08.541
bedlam is good news.

39:09.041 --> 39:12.250
Yes, well, let's hope so,
for your sake, Dijkstra.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.166
Trust me, your Highness.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.708
Elven spy or not,
we are in a strong position.

39:18.458 --> 39:21.208
And I have many more irons in the fire.

39:22.458 --> 39:24.583
-[neighing]
-[driver] Go on! Go on!

39:24.666 --> 39:25.791
[Jaskier] Look, I understand

39:25.875 --> 39:29.000
that what's-her-demon wants
to eat your Child Surprise and all,

39:29.083 --> 39:31.125
and I'm happy to help save her,

39:31.208 --> 39:34.875
but you never even wanted this child
in the first place, and now…

39:36.208 --> 39:39.875
now it's like she has turned
your entire world upside down.

39:39.958 --> 39:41.416
[men talking]

39:42.000 --> 39:42.916
I guess…

39:43.791 --> 39:45.375
what I'm really asking you is…

39:47.458 --> 39:49.291
is this what pleases you?

39:51.875 --> 39:56.833
I thought ignoring Ciri's existence
would make everything better.

39:59.916 --> 40:00.916
I was wrong.

40:04.541 --> 40:05.583
What about Yennefer?

40:05.666 --> 40:08.708
If she's hurt Ciri,
I may just have to kill her.

40:08.791 --> 40:12.000
Oh, no, well, obviously we'll kill her.
We'll definitely kill her.

40:12.083 --> 40:14.875
I just haven't found
a good enough jabbing stick yet.

40:14.958 --> 40:16.750
But what if she's changed too?

40:19.333 --> 40:23.041
People do stupid things when they think
they're trapped in a corner, Geralt.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.833
And they say stupid things.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.916
That's what friends do.

40:29.041 --> 40:30.125
They come back.

40:31.250 --> 40:32.750
[Geralt] This is different.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.916
And I'm sorry, Jaskier.

40:37.916 --> 40:41.541
Gah, you are always so emotional!

40:41.625 --> 40:44.750
I mean, it's just yap, yap, yap
with you sometimes.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.750
[mimicking] "Oh, Jaskier,
I'm so sad and complicated!"

40:47.833 --> 40:49.500
-Shut up, Jaskier.
-You shut up.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.500
That's a perfect impression of you,
by the way.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.541
[snorting]

41:09.416 --> 41:11.000
[Ciri] How can it look the same

41:11.625 --> 41:13.583
when everyone I've known is gone?

41:25.500 --> 41:27.166
There was a monolith there.

41:28.083 --> 41:29.083
The blackest stellacite.

41:30.875 --> 41:32.083
What happened to it?

41:34.833 --> 41:35.708
Me.

41:38.541 --> 41:39.541
You did that?

41:47.083 --> 41:48.250
Ci-- Ciri…

41:49.375 --> 41:51.666
promise me something, if we get separated.

41:54.208 --> 41:55.666
Remember what you have.

41:57.666 --> 41:58.583
Magic.

41:59.708 --> 42:02.083
It's lodged in you. Like a spiked arrow.

42:03.833 --> 42:05.916
It wounds you. Deeply.

42:07.708 --> 42:09.333
But it's a strange sort of pain.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.041
Combined with…

42:13.666 --> 42:14.500
bliss.

42:19.375 --> 42:20.458
Trust me.

42:21.041 --> 42:22.458
It's all you'll ever need.

42:24.583 --> 42:25.625
It's everything.

42:27.375 --> 42:28.750
I want to believe you.

42:30.208 --> 42:31.541
I really do, but…

42:32.791 --> 42:34.041
when you had magic,

42:35.375 --> 42:36.958
you controlled the Chaos.

42:38.541 --> 42:39.875
But it controls me.

42:40.583 --> 42:43.083
No one's been able
to teach me how to use it.

42:45.125 --> 42:45.958
And…

42:47.250 --> 42:48.750
I'm afraid, Yennefer.

42:55.083 --> 42:57.916
[Voleth Meir, echoing] So close…

42:58.833 --> 43:02.083
[overlapping voices] Do what
you have to do to seize your destiny.

43:03.041 --> 43:05.416
Deliver me to the shattered black door.

43:06.416 --> 43:08.125
Destiny.

43:09.666 --> 43:12.500
-Your destiny.
-[gasping]

43:12.583 --> 43:14.250
[high-pitched ringing]

43:14.333 --> 43:16.333
[low rumbling]

43:20.291 --> 43:23.250
[Yennefer] If you're afraid, turn back…
[distorted] …back, back…

43:24.083 --> 43:27.291
[Ciri, echoing] That door mustn't
be opened. You know that.

43:27.375 --> 43:28.750
[Yennefer] I do.

43:28.833 --> 43:30.541
[muffled, distorted echoing]

43:30.625 --> 43:32.500
[Ciri] But you're still leading me there.

43:33.083 --> 43:35.791
[Yennefer] If you're afraid, turn back.
[distorted] You still--

43:35.875 --> 43:38.625
[clearly] You still have time
to turn back. It's not too late.

43:39.208 --> 43:40.208
[Ciri] And you?

43:40.291 --> 43:42.000
[Yennefer] For me, it is… it is…

43:43.416 --> 43:45.625
[distorted] …no choice…
[clearly] I had no choice…

43:46.125 --> 43:48.250
My Chaos… I thought… I thought I had to…

43:53.541 --> 43:54.750
I'm so sorry, Ciri.

43:55.541 --> 43:56.500
Don't go.

43:57.291 --> 43:58.875
I didn't know who you were.

43:59.375 --> 44:01.250
I didn't know what you were to him.

44:01.958 --> 44:03.291
I need to get to him.

44:03.791 --> 44:04.875
He's not here!

44:06.875 --> 44:07.958
He never was.

44:15.208 --> 44:16.833
That mage at Melitele's,

44:18.625 --> 44:19.625
he knew you.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.333
No.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.375
You led him to us.

44:24.458 --> 44:25.291
No.

44:25.375 --> 44:28.166
We were in trouble and needed help,
and you betrayed us!

44:28.250 --> 44:29.750
I was stupid.

44:30.375 --> 44:31.625
And I was selfish!

44:32.375 --> 44:34.000
You have to come with me.

44:34.083 --> 44:34.916
Now!

44:37.166 --> 44:38.458
[distorted] I don't trust you.

44:38.541 --> 44:40.541
[rumbling and crashing]

45:00.333 --> 45:01.875
Sound the alarm!

45:01.958 --> 45:03.666
[neighing]

45:08.166 --> 45:09.250
Get to the horses.

45:12.083 --> 45:13.416
Get to the horses now!

45:20.000 --> 45:21.125
There they are!

45:22.041 --> 45:22.958
Get the girl!

45:23.041 --> 45:24.375
[panting]

45:25.916 --> 45:28.166
-Looks like you lost your horse!
-[neighs]

45:29.291 --> 45:30.541
[grunts]

45:31.666 --> 45:32.541
[yells]

45:32.625 --> 45:33.625
Come here!

45:35.958 --> 45:37.000
Yennefer!

45:37.083 --> 45:38.875
[grunts] Oh, we got a fighter!

45:38.958 --> 45:40.500
-[yells]
-Little brat!

45:40.583 --> 45:41.791
[soldier 2] Get hold of her!

45:42.458 --> 45:43.416
[yells]

45:47.583 --> 45:49.583
[all yelling]

45:55.875 --> 45:57.208
Come on, Bard!

46:00.333 --> 46:01.750
Right in his fuckin' nose!

46:01.833 --> 46:03.583
In the kneecaps!

46:05.208 --> 46:06.583
Come here, you little--

46:11.916 --> 46:13.458
[soldier] Stop it. Stay down!

46:14.916 --> 46:15.750
Hey!

46:38.041 --> 46:39.791
How could you do this?

46:40.541 --> 46:41.750
I'm so sorry.

46:45.666 --> 46:47.833
Yarpen and his men
will get you out of here.

46:48.750 --> 46:51.291
Jaskier, take her to Kaer Morhen.

46:52.541 --> 46:53.708
Ciri knows the way.

46:53.791 --> 46:55.750
No. No, I'm staying with you.

46:55.833 --> 46:57.291
[sighs] You can't.

46:57.833 --> 46:59.875
Why? Where are you going?

47:01.375 --> 47:02.458
To slay a monster.

47:04.666 --> 47:06.208
I'll be with you soon, I promise.

47:12.791 --> 47:13.666
All right.

47:17.708 --> 47:20.250
The Child Surprise, I've heard so much a--

47:21.750 --> 47:23.125
Like father, like daughter.

47:26.750 --> 47:27.625
The girl.

47:28.291 --> 47:29.125
Yours?

47:29.208 --> 47:31.208
[sword rings]

47:35.333 --> 47:36.166
Mine.

47:41.916 --> 47:43.333
Mine, Zigrin.

47:50.625 --> 47:51.541
Say it.

47:53.791 --> 47:55.750
Behold the mother of forests…

47:55.833 --> 47:57.333
[driver] Bah! Bah!

47:57.416 --> 47:58.666
…the Deathless Mother,

47:59.458 --> 48:00.708
nesting in dreams.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.875
Turn your back to the forest, hut, hut.

48:07.083 --> 48:08.416
Turn your front to me.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.416
Hut. Hut.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.083
[gasps]

48:14.375 --> 48:16.041
[cooing]

48:18.250 --> 48:19.791
[cries out]

48:23.666 --> 48:25.375
[Filavandrel yelling]

48:25.458 --> 48:27.791
-[gasps]
-[sobbing]

48:27.875 --> 48:29.083
[Francesca] Oh, no…

48:29.958 --> 48:31.958
[whimpering]

48:35.500 --> 48:37.000
[screaming]

48:37.083 --> 48:39.333
-[flames roaring]
-[Francesca screaming]

48:40.083 --> 48:41.916
[cackling]

48:52.791 --> 48:54.791
[laughing wildly]

49:07.916 --> 49:08.958
She's gone.

49:10.333 --> 49:11.291
It's always worked.

49:12.291 --> 49:15.125
The first witchers imprisoned her
in this hut for eternity.

49:15.208 --> 49:17.125
She shouldn't be able to escape.

49:19.750 --> 49:20.791
Unless…

49:22.250 --> 49:23.083
What?

49:23.166 --> 49:25.041
Unless she's had her fill

49:25.625 --> 49:27.208
of pain and desperation.

49:29.375 --> 49:31.166
It would have given her new life.

49:31.958 --> 49:32.958
To do what?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.708
[neighing]

50:01.166 --> 50:03.166
[hissing]

50:11.458 --> 50:14.750
[Voleth Meir cackling]
