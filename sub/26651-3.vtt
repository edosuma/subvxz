Lenora, they're coming.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.440
Where's DeGraaf?

00:36.040 --> 00:37.440
Good question.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.320
(English)  You drive, you out!

00:43.440 --> 00:44.920
You're leaving me here?

00:45.320 --> 00:48.400
My darling, you're my most precious cargo,
I wouldn't leave you anywhere,

00:48.800 --> 00:53.200
but we can't have a lady upfront on this
ride, so get in the back with the guys.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.240
Get the fuck out,
I already asked you nicely.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.600
(Ominous rumbling)

01:09.520 --> 01:10.400
Order! Out!

02:04.480 --> 02:06.480
they spend money on these stupid posters.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.520
Look at this.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.280
It makes me sick.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.520
Let's go.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.320
Thank you.

02:21.920 --> 02:22.840
Excuse me!

02:24.520 --> 02:25.520
Can I help you?

02:25.720 --> 02:27.160
Mr... Amend.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.120
My friends Tim and Katie here
are visiting Berlin for the first time.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.960
I see. Then welcome to Berlin.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.280
They just told me a funny joke.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.320
Want to hear it?

02:38.480 --> 02:41.200
-Okay.
-Joe runs into his buddy Jack,

02:41.280 --> 02:43.080
who he hasn't seen in years.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.080
Joe asks Jack how he's doing
and Jack says: "Well,

02:46.160 --> 02:48.760
my girlfriend left me last week."

02:48.840 --> 02:50.120
Or was it a boyfriend?

02:50.200 --> 02:52.640
-Boyfriend.
-So Jack says:

02:52.720 --> 02:55.920
"And then my house was robbed,
and I lost my job."

02:56.000 --> 02:57.400
Joe replies: "That's awful, Jack!

02:57.880 --> 03:01.040
Hasn't anything positive
happened to you recently?"

03:01.120 --> 03:02.600
Jack: "Well, there was one thing...

03:03.520 --> 03:04.640
My AIDS test."

03:06.280 --> 03:07.480
Funny, right?

03:07.640 --> 03:08.960
Yeah.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.480
Here's another!

03:10.680 --> 03:12.800
The doctor tells the faggot:
"You've got AIDS.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.400
Now tell that to everyone
you've ever screwed

03:15.480 --> 03:16.880
so they get checked too."

03:16.960 --> 03:20.800
The faggot goes: "Does it look like
I have eyes on the back of my head?"

03:20.960 --> 03:21.760
Funny, huh?

03:21.840 --> 03:22.640
(Music sets in)

03:22.720 --> 03:24.240
You're goddamn right it's not funny!

03:24.600 --> 03:25.680
It's a fucking tragedy!

03:25.760 --> 03:27.440
What makes you think I'm homophobic?

03:27.520 --> 03:31.200
How about you do some research
before we're all fucking dead!

03:31.280 --> 03:32.760
If you really want to discuss that,

03:32.840 --> 03:35.800
make an appointment with my office.

I see your brother has joined

04:10.840 --> 04:13.960
One of my weakest patients
had a seizure last night.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.400
I'm worried this could be
a side-effect of giving him Beroxalin.

04:18.680 --> 04:19.880
Why?

04:20.200 --> 04:24.160
Bronchodilators are known
to cause seizures.

04:24.600 --> 04:29.880
Which one is in Beroxalin?
They gave us so little information.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.520
Well, today's lung volume tests
were very promising.

04:32.840 --> 04:37.000
Still. We don't have enough
anti-seizure meds for an emergency!

04:37.640 --> 04:38.640
What are you suggesting?

04:38.720 --> 04:41.440
That we find out more about Beroxalin
before we continue the study.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.120
We've been set a task, Dr. Fischer.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.440
Let's wait and see how this develops.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.760
Was there anything else?

04:54.760 --> 04:57.240
(Subway trains)

05:00.000 --> 05:02.680
Why is it medical students
always eat the worst crap?

05:03.680 --> 05:05.160

Frau Netz. Wow.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.280

05:14.800 --> 05:16.400
How do you know each other?

05:16.480 --> 05:17.640
After your father was...

05:19.680 --> 05:22.240
General Jackson helped me find a new job.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.520
Now I'm a secretary
at the US Embassy to East Berlin.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.400
Where she works with me.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.880
With both of us.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.400
-And you?
-I'm in medical school at the Free Uni.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.600
Specializing in infectious disease.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.120
Well, then.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.720
Good luck with that.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.640
See you Monday.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.000
(Freight cars rolling past)

How many people live in Berlin?

05:51.720 --> 05:54.320
And I run into Frau Netz,
she's always hated me.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.160
When the accident happened,
it just fulfilled her worst nightmare.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.440
(Background muzak)

05:58.560 --> 05:59.960
What accident?

06:03.320 --> 06:04.480
I shot my father.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.560
With his own rifle
while I was trying to shoot myself.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.480
Oh. Alex.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.400
At the time, I was a bit...

06:14.360 --> 06:16.040
Anyway, he tried to stop me.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.760
And when he pulled the gun from me,
it went off. And shot him.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.560
Now he's paralyzed from the waist down.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.040
Are you still in touch?

06:31.720 --> 06:34.720
No military general wants
a son who's a flaming queer.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.880
But he was ok with being shot?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.000
(Ominous drone culminates in bang)

06:45.480 --> 06:47.800
(Crescendo and percussion)

07:07.640 --> 07:10.440
(English)  So they always show you
the money first, got that?

07:10.840 --> 07:13.120
You get the cash upfront.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.760
Then you leave me to do my thing,
work my magic, yeah?

07:17.160 --> 07:19.000
Hey, you might learn something.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.480
Like how to kill two birds with one stone,
maybe three.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.880
Get a little bit extra on the side.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.920
I mean these idiots,
they want to blow up the whole place!

07:29.320 --> 07:31.080
Hey don't worry, China,

07:31.480 --> 07:34.760
we're not going
to allow them to waste all that fuel.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.800

(Portuguese)  This is Romeo 23.
White truck approaching. Over.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.240
Hello, Tina.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.440
I need a word.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.120
In private.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.920
Of course.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.280
I heard you have some concerns
about our study.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.800
Dr. Albrecht says the results so far
have been extremely positive.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.520
For some patients.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.760
Isn't it common, in a study like this one,
to have variation in patient responses?

08:31.400 --> 08:32.720
Yes.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.560
But I need to be able to
voice my concerns about the side effects.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.400
I swore the Hippocratic Oath.
A commitment to my patients and to myself.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.240
(A dismissive snort)

08:45.960 --> 08:48.520
A commitment takes precedence
over all others?

08:49.760 --> 08:53.360
Precedence over the hundreds of
East German citizens who suffer from COPD?

08:55.920 --> 08:57.280
Precedence over progress?

08:58.160 --> 08:59.240
Over Socialism?

09:01.240 --> 09:03.400
(Oppressive silence)

09:06.240 --> 09:08.280
Think about it, hm?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.880
I'm sure we'll see each other soon.
Goodbye.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.560
Get out of the truck
with your hands on your head!

09:42.400 --> 09:44.320
Get out with your hands on your head!

09:45.360 --> 09:46.880
Hey, hey, hands up.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.280
(Portuguese)  Hello, Luis.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.840
How are you?

09:55.040 --> 09:56.240
Martin?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.040
What are you doing here?

09:58.440 --> 09:59.960
I have a new job.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.240
Your commander is expecting us.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.640
We have a delivery for him.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.800
From teacher to arms dealer?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.400
Something like that.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.080
(Clatter of gates)

10:19.360 --> 10:21.600
-Should I sign here?
-No,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.080
I only have to check the delivery.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.400
(Clatter of tailgate)

10:30.240 --> 10:32.640
Your commander will be very pleased.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.240
(Expectant tones)

10:52.880 --> 10:54.080
(Whistles)

10:55.760 --> 10:56.600
Happy?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.360
Yeah.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.680
Bring her here.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.120
(Snarling)

11:25.280 --> 11:27.280
(Portuguese)  Hey, gorgeous!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.360
(Bestial roar)

11:30.080 --> 11:31.240
(Placating tones)

11:34.240 --> 11:35.440
What is that?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.520
Hey you!

11:39.480 --> 11:40.400
(Whimpering)

11:42.960 --> 11:44.160
What are you doing there?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.200
(English)  Good girl!

11:46.640 --> 11:48.760
(Chattering submissively)

11:50.040 --> 11:52.000
Good girl.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.680
Open the gate!

11:55.640 --> 11:57.200
(Percussive, driving music)

12:03.800 --> 12:05.640
(Incoherent shouting)

12:23.640 --> 12:25.280
(Voice over walkie-talkie)

13:15.720 --> 13:17.160
Open it up.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.480
Major Kalumba is waiting for you.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.560
(Ominous drones)

13:42.600 --> 13:44.600
(German)  I heard we had a visitor
from East Germany,

13:44.680 --> 13:47.320
in which case,
I had to come over and say hello.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.640
Hello.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.000
I'm Steinbrecher from Chemnitz.
Chief technician here.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.200
Oh.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.720
Director General Straub from VEB
Petrochemical Combine Schwedt

13:56.800 --> 13:59.760
commends your bravery in the face
of great danger here today.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.640
Play it cool, Comrade.
We've got an audience.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.040
Thank you.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.560
Well, then.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.920
I've got to get back to work.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.480
See you.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.640
(Mechanical creaking)

14:22.960 --> 14:25.000
(Thud of metal)

14:27.600 --> 14:28.960
(A door squeaks)

14:29.800 --> 14:32.360
(Portuguese)  Major, the visitors are here.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.440
Welcome!

14:37.600 --> 14:40.840
(English)  -I'm Major John Kalumba.
-Martin Winger, we've been in contact.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.120
-This is...
-Security.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.920
-You've been enjoying our country?
-Course.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.480
I'm curious...

14:50.280 --> 14:52.080
What is your commission on this deal?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.840
Twenty percent?

14:56.640 --> 14:58.240
Do you want the missiles or not?

14:59.760 --> 15:00.720
Yeah. Of course.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.840
Let's get down to business.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.680
(Ominous drone)

15:08.920 --> 15:09.920
So...

15:10.320 --> 15:14.560
We've got twelve Würfel & Struth BR Wespe
missiles with infrared guided system.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.440
You know,
I think it's baby-faced guys like you

15:21.840 --> 15:23.880
that keep this war alive.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.360
Excellent.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.800
-Shall go down and look at the goods?
-No. Payment first.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.320
(He laughs)

15:39.840 --> 15:41.080
(Knocking at the door)

15:43.000 --> 15:44.720
Ah, Hartmann!

15:45.320 --> 15:46.520
So?

15:48.960 --> 15:51.080
Operation Microchip is up and running.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.840
I formed a workgroup.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.200
Very good.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.400
And, what's the latest
from the inner circle?

16:01.040 --> 16:04.320
No money's come in yet from
that weapons deal in South Africa.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.840
Dietrich really lit into Fuchs about it.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.360
I think he kind of likes it.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.480
Did Fuchs mention Kolibri?

16:16.320 --> 16:17.920
Kolibri, you mean Martin Rauch?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.200
Of course.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.880
I heard

16:21.760 --> 16:24.520
he's helping Lenora with the deal.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.840
What? Wasn't he banished
to the bush years ago?

16:29.440 --> 16:31.640
The latest from Lenora is that

16:31.720 --> 16:35.080
she's sending a Comrade
from the ANC here to train with us,

16:35.240 --> 16:39.200
who will travel back to South Africa with
the distinguished workers on the cruise.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.160
Assuming we can afford
a ship that doesn't sink first.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.480
(Biting sound)

16:52.520 --> 16:55.840
(Cry of seagulls, a ship's horn)

16:58.840 --> 17:00.600
Well, bye then.

17:03.760 --> 17:04.840
(A brief knock)

17:05.120 --> 17:06.920
Comrade Fuchs, do you have a minute?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Who is that?

17:13.080 --> 17:14.800
One of Mandela's soldiers.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.920
She'll be a guide on the workers cruise.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.560
I heard we're looking for a new ship...

17:22.840 --> 17:24.480
So, here's what I was thinking.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.240
West German TV

17:28.760 --> 17:30.760
just bought a new ship
for "The Love Boat".

17:30.840 --> 17:32.600
So we could take the old one.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.800
Buy the old "Love Boat"?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.680
-Why not?
-Because we can't afford it.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.320
We only have 90 million.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.800
But if it's too old for TV,
it could be just right for us.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.520
If we remove the rooms in the hull,

17:46.920 --> 17:49.200
we can easily make up the money.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.040
How?

17:52.640 --> 17:53.800
Comrade Fuchs,

17:53.880 --> 17:56.680
just imagine
all the space down there

17:57.040 --> 17:59.120
we could use to hide just about anything.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.920
Cars.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.960
Weapons.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.600
Plenty of West German companies
would pay a pretty penny

18:06.960 --> 18:10.440
to get their cargo into South Africa
under the radar of UN sanctions.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.120
Weapons.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.800
I've got someone who
might help us do that.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.760
(A drumming)

18:19.840 --> 18:21.040
Frank Winkelmann.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.160
West German Trade Commissioner
in Cape Town.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.520
Comrade Dietrich always says
we should turn our assets into cash.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.640
OPERATION "LOVE BOAT"

18:47.080 --> 18:48.320
You're welcome.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.280
(Ominous drone)

18:56.600 --> 18:57.880
(Door shuts)

18:58.280 --> 18:59.760
(Briefcase clicking open)

19:11.960 --> 19:13.920
(Droning intensifies)

19:14.120 --> 19:17.880
350,000... U.S. Dollars.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.760
(Drums)

19:21.120 --> 19:23.640
(Portuguese)  You really think
we'll make it into the finals this year?

19:24.040 --> 19:25.880
You're crazy.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.480
We'd beat West Germany in a home game.
It'll start soon.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.680
Everything will be different in Mexico.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.680
Okay, you're crazy. I got to piss.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.960
(Droning builds, then rattling)

19:58.960 --> 20:00.960
The end user's certificates.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.120
(A whirring)

20:04.200 --> 20:05.040
Hey!

20:05.400 --> 20:08.120
(English)  Drop the guns on the floor,
put your hands above your heads. Now!

20:08.520 --> 20:09.920
Before he dies.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.200
Good choice.

20:16.920 --> 20:20.400
You, take all of them,
put them in that room over there.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.920
I've gotten an entire battalion of
highly trained soldiers at this refinery.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.000
Clearly.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.720
Ricardo.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.520
Ricardo?
What, did you drown in your own piss?

20:34.240 --> 20:36.320
(Sinister tones)

20:45.240 --> 20:46.880
(Echoing clanking of doors)

20:52.080 --> 20:53.600
(Build-up and stabbing sound)

20:56.960 --> 20:59.440
-You'll never get away with this.
-Shut up.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.600
You, go to the front there

21:02.000 --> 21:05.440
and tell them I need three tankers
filled with diesel

21:06.400 --> 21:08.040
at the front gate.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.320
Now. Make a call.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.440
Make a fucking call.
The phone's over there.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.160
And tell them to be quick.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.160
(A rusty squeaking)

21:16.240 --> 21:18.040
What are you looking at?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.880
Make a fucking call.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.040
I need those tankers at the gate now.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.040
(Portuguese)  Control room speaking.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.560
Yes, three tankers
filled with diesel to the front gate.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.200
-Yes, now.
-Alright.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.120
(A rising, droning screech)

21:44.680 --> 21:46.600
(Drums set in)

21:48.520 --> 21:50.640
(Xylophone sets in)

22:04.600 --> 22:05.680
(She gasps)

22:05.840 --> 22:07.280
(Keyboard sets in)

22:17.480 --> 22:18.960
(Panting)

22:33.600 --> 22:36.160
(Drumming reaches a crescendo)

22:39.880 --> 22:41.720
(Metallic creaking)

22:44.880 --> 22:46.280
(Panting)

22:48.920 --> 22:50.360
(A bird-like call)

22:51.000 --> 22:51.840
(Squeaking)

22:54.600 --> 22:56.400
Well done, Roberto. Well done.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.080
Now the switch.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.120
Flip it like I showed you.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.320
(A ping followed by electronic beeping)

23:07.000 --> 23:08.240
(A stopwatch being set)

23:09.520 --> 23:10.840
(Metal on metal)

23:13.120 --> 23:14.800
(English)
Look at these mothers!

23:15.720 --> 23:18.040
What are they, just farting around here!

23:18.440 --> 23:20.640
Make a call, tell them to hurry up.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.120
Hello?

23:23.520 --> 23:25.560
Control room speaking.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.400
Yes, three tanks filled with fuel
to the front gate.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.080
(A door slams)

23:39.240 --> 23:40.760
Shit!

23:40.880 --> 23:43.120
(Drumming returns)

23:44.680 --> 23:46.240
(Portuguese)  Hey, this way.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.440
There are more of them over there!

23:49.760 --> 23:50.680
Go!

23:53.200 --> 23:54.040
Over there! Over there!

23:54.120 --> 23:56.640
This way, this way. Go.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.880
(The door squeaks as it is locked)

24:02.920 --> 24:04.720
(The rattle of keys)

24:06.440 --> 24:07.640
What is this place?

24:08.400 --> 24:09.600
My bunker.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.080
My little East German cave.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.760
Supplies for a whole month!

24:14.840 --> 24:17.240
And not that much smaller
than my cabin in Brandenburg.

24:21.840 --> 24:25.280
If this takes a while, we'll break out
the Spreewald pickles.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.000
Don't you know what's going on?

24:28.080 --> 24:29.560
(The thumping of pipes)

24:31.440 --> 24:33.480
It's the third attack since I got here.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.000
That guy you came with

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
didn't look trustworthy.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.720
He's taking Kalumba hostage.

24:40.360 --> 24:43.000
And brought in UNITA rebels
to blow up the refinery.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.320
That's happened a year ago.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.920
In which case I'd better...

24:56.880 --> 25:00.720
(A motoric rattle, then a siren)

25:01.960 --> 25:03.000
What did you do?

25:03.080 --> 25:04.240
That's a red alert.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.120
-Did you have to do that?
-Yup. Regulations.

25:07.280 --> 25:10.760
In case of a military attack on
the socialist project Angopetrol Limited,

25:10.840 --> 25:12.720
a red alert must be sounded immediately.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.680
Because...
there's tetraethyl in the main tank.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.120
Tetra what?

25:18.040 --> 25:20.560
A fuel additive toxic to
the nervous system on decomposition.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.080
In case of an explosion,
it creates a nasty cloud.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.240
You mean, in case of an explosion...

25:27.320 --> 25:28.800
Don't worry.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.760
We'll be safe here either way.
No matter what happens.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.880
What about the people outside?

25:33.960 --> 25:35.600
The whole region up around there?

25:35.800 --> 25:37.360
(Whistles expressively)

25:39.320 --> 25:40.280
(Laughs)

25:40.360 --> 25:43.040
(A nocturne commences)

25:44.080 --> 25:45.560
(A rushing sound, men bellow, gunfire)

25:49.600 --> 25:51.280
(The siren sounds, shooting)

25:55.840 --> 25:59.120
You better bring me
those tankers or I'll...

25:59.600 --> 26:02.440
(Gunfire, siren sounding)

26:20.160 --> 26:22.200
(A keyboard tinkles over the soundscape)

26:31.840 --> 26:34.000
(The nocturn returns)

26:46.320 --> 26:47.560
(Muttering)

26:48.200 --> 26:49.280
That's the gate...

26:52.240 --> 26:53.440
What's this here?

26:53.760 --> 26:55.200
Petrol. Main tank.

26:56.400 --> 27:01.280
God, I'd give anything for a cold,
rainy day back home in East Germany.

27:01.360 --> 27:04.000
If you wanted to cause
the greatest possible damage,

27:04.080 --> 27:05.680
where would you place a bomb?

27:06.160 --> 27:07.640
That's easy.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.680
Blow up the liquid gas tank here
and you take out the entire compound.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.080
But, like I said, we're safe in here.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.800
(A motor dies, the nocturn fades)

27:20.160 --> 27:21.560
I need your key.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.040
The key?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.280
You're safe in here, I have to go out.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.120
I'm not letting you out of here.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.520
I'm not opening that door.
Who knows who's waiting outside? Ha, ha.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.200
Give me the key.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.040
(Piano music returns)

27:37.240 --> 27:38.400
No.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.640
Have you ever killed someone?

27:45.160 --> 27:46.360
Of course not.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.800
Well, I have.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.000
How about giving me that key?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.360
(A droning replaces the piano)

27:56.560 --> 27:57.760
Now.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.720
(A motor, stuttering and turning over)

28:04.120 --> 28:06.000
(A frantic beeping)

28:13.040 --> 28:14.000
Fuck!

28:15.000 --> 28:17.040
(A driving beat sets in)

28:35.680 --> 28:37.000
(She cries out)

28:37.280 --> 28:38.760
(A groaning)

28:42.760 --> 28:44.240
Finish her off!

28:51.480 --> 28:53.480
(Gentle keyboard music)

28:56.440 --> 28:57.640
Roberto.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.400
You know me.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.240
We're on the same side.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.480
Don't move.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.760
(Sudden gunfire)

29:12.080 --> 29:14.240
(Keyboard grows more intense)

29:14.640 --> 29:16.000
(Tense, high-pitched music)

29:32.040 --> 29:33.480
(Crescendo and dying fall)

29:43.680 --> 29:46.080
See that little switch there, Roberto?

29:47.560 --> 29:49.720
The rifle is set to full-automatic.

29:51.520 --> 29:55.960
Pull that trigger and you'll
shoot hundreds of bullets at once.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.560
(Music fades)

30:00.520 --> 30:01.720
Roberto!

30:06.880 --> 30:09.760
Remember the three things
you have to do to become a man?

30:11.280 --> 30:12.480
Remember?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.720
Killing doesn't make you a man.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.000
It makes you a killer.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.360
You left me, Martin.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.400
(Distant siren sounding)

30:37.520 --> 30:38.920
The bomb.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.760
(An urgent whirring)

30:41.120 --> 30:42.520
Where's the bomb?

30:43.760 --> 30:44.960
(The whirring returns)

30:46.160 --> 30:48.960
Less than seven minutes until it explodes.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.880
(Tense percussion)

30:56.560 --> 30:58.600
(The beep of the detonator device)

30:58.960 --> 31:00.360
Slowly.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.200
Careful.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.240
Be careful.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.400
(The detonator's beeping grows frantic)

31:12.160 --> 31:13.360
Can you defuse it?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
No.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.440
Okay.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.640
(The beeping grows still faster)

31:22.840 --> 31:24.360
(The siren screeches)

31:47.600 --> 31:48.960
(A rolling of drums)

31:50.360 --> 31:52.600
(A rolling of drums and bullets
over the siren)

31:54.440 --> 31:56.080
(Whirring metal and a cry)

32:00.560 --> 32:02.240
(Fluttering paper)

32:03.440 --> 32:05.400
(Clacking electronic beat)

32:07.360 --> 32:09.400
(The giddy sound of falling)

32:12.160 --> 32:13.640
(A dying echo)

32:15.720 --> 32:18.440
(A new-wave synth sets in)

32:24.400 --> 32:28.600
(Synth goes from intro to riff, builds.
Power pop resounds)

32:50.120 --> 32:52.880
(Music cuts out momentarily
as voice sounds)

32:55.680 --> 32:57.280
(Music is back again)

33:03.760 --> 33:06.000
(A guitar picks out the melody)

33:12.960 --> 33:14.440
(A blow landing)

33:33.480 --> 33:34.920
(The bill lands with a crunch)

33:56.280 --> 33:58.360
(All sound fades)

34:02.760 --> 34:05.200
(New wave tune resounds in the distance)

34:45.200 --> 34:46.880
(Electronic beeping, gunfire)

34:50.720 --> 34:52.240
Ah, fuck!

34:53.360 --> 34:55.160
(Bestial yelping)

35:00.000 --> 35:01.320
(Snorting)

35:02.000 --> 35:03.640
(A threatening growl)

35:12.200 --> 35:13.880
(Beeping growing closer)

35:15.400 --> 35:17.360
(Beeping and panting)

35:26.240 --> 35:27.880
(Frantic breathing)

35:30.480 --> 35:32.720
(Beeping growing frenetic)

35:35.240 --> 35:40.040
(Beeping accelerating to a crescendo)

35:40.280 --> 35:41.200
(Fizzes out)

35:47.560 --> 35:48.880
(Sighs with relief)

36:03.440 --> 36:06.440
(A heart monitor beeping frantically)

36:07.040 --> 36:09.080
(And deadlining)

36:13.760 --> 36:15.480
Let's resuscitate. Adrenalin.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.120
Oxygen.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

36:21.640 --> 36:25.800
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, breathe.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.720
One, two, three...

36:39.680 --> 36:44.160
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

36:44.240 --> 36:46.800
eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.400
Turn it off.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.920
(Fade-out of monitoring devices)

37:09.920 --> 37:12.040
(Ambient voices)

37:12.120 --> 37:14.880
How many more patients
need to die for this Beroxalin study?

37:15.200 --> 37:17.080
Don't be melodramatic, Dr. Fischer.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.320
One dead patient and
two more in critical condition

37:20.400 --> 37:22.760
are not enough to draw conclusions.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.800
How much are the West Germans
paying our government

37:26.880 --> 37:28.640
to do their dirty work?

37:29.440 --> 37:31.520
How much blood money for our guinea pigs?

37:35.640 --> 37:36.880
I won't continue.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.160
No, you won't.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.320
Go home.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.280
You're suspended immediately, Dr. Fischer.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.800
It's better this way.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.120
(The play of wind over keyboard tones)

38:11.120 --> 38:13.920
(Still-excited inhalation)

38:16.160 --> 38:17.520
(A clatter)

38:49.360 --> 38:50.400
(Gunfire)

38:51.720 --> 38:53.280
Come here. Stay down.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.400
There's a sniper here somewhere.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.640
Saint Martin, always ready to share.

39:05.720 --> 39:06.880
(She laughs)

39:06.960 --> 39:09.200
Take it or I'll just split it
with Roberto.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.480
Put it away.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.480
Your mother must have
done something right.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.960
Or was it East Germany?

39:15.400 --> 39:16.600
Where is he?

39:16.720 --> 39:17.800
I don't know.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.080
On the roof.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.200
Watch out.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.880
(Gunfire)

39:44.240 --> 39:45.800
-Stay here!
-Roberto!

39:46.840 --> 39:49.200
(Bagpiping synth tones)

39:58.120 --> 39:59.440
(Fade out)

40:00.560 --> 40:03.360
On the count of three. One, two, three.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.560
Nora, come on!

40:07.440 --> 40:09.400
(Tense clattering tones and drums)

40:15.480 --> 40:18.880
(A shot falls and all becomes silent
except for panting)

40:22.120 --> 40:23.280
(Ugh)

40:28.880 --> 40:30.800
(Increasingly distant footfall)

40:30.880 --> 40:33.320
(The buzz of flies, whimpering)

40:41.720 --> 40:44.320
Kleinmachnow, East Germany

40:44.440 --> 40:48.880
(Voices of children, shop chatter)

40:59.240 --> 41:00.640
Oh, sorry.

41:00.720 --> 41:01.520
Oh!

41:01.600 --> 41:03.120
-Ingrid!
-Walther!

41:03.560 --> 41:04.360
You.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.240
You came to Kleinmachnow
to do your shopping?

41:07.320 --> 41:09.760
Yes, I just happened
to be in the neighborhood...

41:12.600 --> 41:14.200
This must be Max.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.400
Who are you?

41:18.120 --> 41:19.920
-I am...
-An acquaintance.

41:20.320 --> 41:23.880
Max, why don't you go over and
say hi to Mrs. Trautzschke?

41:35.160 --> 41:37.160
Maybe we could have a coffee sometime?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.760
Or a soda?

41:41.120 --> 41:42.800
I want to get to know Max.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.560
-Did Annett put you up to this?
-No, why?

41:47.240 --> 41:48.920
You work together now, don't you?

41:50.000 --> 41:53.120
If you want to get to know Max,
then just ask her.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.640
-He's her son.
-But he's our grandson.

41:58.440 --> 41:59.840
I have to go now.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.080
(80s pop ballad sets in,
Howard Jones' "No One is to Blame")

42:50.320 --> 42:52.360
(Tense, ominous music)
