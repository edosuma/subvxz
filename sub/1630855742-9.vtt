WEBVTT

01:58.327 --> 01:59.870
Oh, my God.

02:57.553 --> 02:59.012
What's going on there, Levy?

03:02.891 --> 03:05.394
I'm just thinking
about the wildfires in California.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.021
Okay. As one does.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.067
We covered it a couple of years ago.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.863
And there was this woman.
Oh, God, I remember her so clearly.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.825
She had this little backpack on,
like a little kid's backpack,

03:19.825 --> 03:24.162
and she clearly just lost her home
and her car and everything.

03:24.162 --> 03:28.542
She was just wandering back and forth
behind our cameras,

03:28.542 --> 03:30.836
and you could just see
she didn't know what to do,

03:30.836 --> 03:32.713
and she had no idea where to go.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.464
Alex,
we're not burning anybody's house down.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.134
Really? I mean, we kind of are.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.305
We're killing a company
that has existed for 80 years.

03:41.305 --> 03:44.433
And I'm, like, standing there
holding a match, you know?

03:44.433 --> 03:47.477
Yeah. I could see if I was
in your position, I might feel that way.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.062
Yeah, but see, you're not.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.356
This company gave me my career.

03:52.024 --> 03:57.029
Wait a m-- No.
No, this company gave you a job.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.700
You-- You made that into something else.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.997
Okay. It's just moving--

04:06.997 --> 04:09.917
- It's just moving really, really fast.
- Yeah, I know.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.670
And I wish we could slow it down,
but we do not have that luxury.

04:16.507 --> 04:20.260
And I know the secrecy of it is not ideal.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.472
I just feel like I've failed, you know?
'Cause otherwise this--

04:23.472 --> 04:25.849
- None of this would be happening.
- Okay, sure. Yeah,

04:25.849 --> 04:29.019
you can look at it that way. Sure.
You can tell yourself that,

04:29.019 --> 04:32.314
or you could look at this
as an opportunity

04:32.314 --> 04:34.775
to create something
that will survive into the future.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.987
You wanna run your own studio?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.906
Run your own studio.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.951
Bring Mia, bring Bradley, bring Chris.
Bring 'em all.

04:45.452 --> 04:50.207
This is a chance to create something new,
something better.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.252
But you have to really, really want it.

04:59.758 --> 05:00.592
Do you?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.933
Wow, you've been with Hyperion
since the beginning.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.644
You were really part
of making that company happen.

05:11.436 --> 05:16.733
I'm also wondering, you know,
working for a visionary like Paul Marks,

05:16.733 --> 05:19.486
it must have been
a really difficult decision to leave.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.239
<i>Yeah, well, it was time to move on.</i>

05:22.239 --> 05:25.200
You know, over a third of the engineers
that worked on Hyperion Two

05:25.200 --> 05:27.077
have left since March.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.079
That's a lot of people.

05:29.079 --> 05:32.791
I was just wondering if there were
any problems, safety concerns,

05:32.791 --> 05:36.753
problems with management.
Just why do you think the mass exodus?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.797
<i>I'm sorry. I have to go.</i>

05:38.797 --> 05:42.050
I know you signed an NDA,
and I'm not gonna get you sued.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.927
I won't use your name. I just need a--

05:44.928 --> 05:45.929
Fuck.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.849
That was the last name on my list.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.896
All the names we found, and nothing?

05:53.896 --> 05:55.939
All manner of fucked-up shit
could be happening there,

05:55.939 --> 05:57.941
and no one's gonna know.
Paul's got everybody spooked.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.109
Any word from Kate?

05:59.109 --> 06:02.821
She does not want to be found. We need
to find someone who will go on the record.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.573
What about Paul's lower-level employees?

06:04.573 --> 06:06.742
You know, somebody
who's not "NDAed" to death, right?

06:06.742 --> 06:10.662
- Yeah. You think they would talk?
- 100%. Definitely.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.415
I mean, as a recently fired employee of--

06:13.916 --> 06:17.753
how do I put this-- a challenging boss,
I speak from experience.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.881
- Painful, fucking bitter experience.
- Stella, we're gonna get it done.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.551
By Friday?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.345
Because once Paul owns UBA,

06:26.345 --> 06:30.265
anything we find will just make us
feel shittier that he's our boss.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.562
This is fantastic.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.815
Send them ten pounds
of Black Ivory Coffee.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.900
Black Ivory?

06:40.609 --> 06:42.528
They only made 500 pounds last year.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.322
- Total in the world.
- Yeah, I know.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.200
- Got a minute?
- Oh, Earl. Yeah. Come in.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.954
All right, so put out word on the socials,
make new friends on the dark web,

06:51.954 --> 06:54.665
volunteer at the zoo
and freestyle a batch.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.125
Just get me those beans, Kyle.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.210
On it.

07:01.964 --> 07:05.008
You seen UBA's trading activity today?

07:05.008 --> 07:06.218
Not yet.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.137
Who's getting slaughtered,
beside the big tech companies out there?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.101
That's--

07:15.727 --> 07:19.106
That's steeper than El Cap.
Someone needs to free solo that shit.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.901
Started at the bell,
volume hasn't let up since.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.322
Figured it was arb traders,
so I reached out to the usual suspects.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.158
It's not them,
and they don't know who it is.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.619
Come on, Earl.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.955
Traders are worse than middle schoolers
with a crush.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.040
They can't keep a secret
to save their lives.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.293
These buyers are keeping it very quiet.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.964
We may not know anything
till they file with the SEC.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.342
Did you have fun
at my surprise party last year?

07:48.051 --> 07:49.303
Don't think I was invited.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.847
Yeah, 'cause there wasn't one.
I hate surprises.

07:51.847 --> 07:56.935
I especially hate them when they're four
days before I close a $40 billion deal.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.938
Find out who is buying.

07:59.938 --> 08:04.776
I don't want any assholes popping out of
closets this week and fucking things up.

08:04.776 --> 08:05.861
Yes, sir.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.832
<i>We're sorry. You have reached</i>

08:18.832 --> 08:22.169
<i>a number that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service. Please--</i>

08:29.426 --> 08:30.427
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.347
You got a minute? I'm getting bounced
between lawyers and bean counters here.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.599
Yeah, sure. What's up?

08:37.768 --> 08:39.937
You've never been through
one of these before, have you?

08:39.937 --> 08:41.188
An acquisition?

08:41.188 --> 08:45.359
Well, UBA bought my start-up,
but not for 40 billion.

08:46.777 --> 08:50.697
Yeah, well, there's always fallout
when one company takes another one over.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.616
No one likes to be shown the door.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.410
You think Cory's gonna lose his shit.

08:56.620 --> 09:01.375
Maybe we could send a shrink along
with his $150 million severance package.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.543
Yeah, don't touch that.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.505
Yeah, about that.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.258
I've done my due diligence on Cory.

09:09.258 --> 09:13.011
I was just curious
if you had anything to add.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.349
You ever see him cross a line?

09:17.933 --> 09:21.103
Like self-dealing,
corporate espionage type stuff? No.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.647
Never. He's way too careful
for anything like that.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.149
Yeah, what about his personal life?
What's that look like?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.152
As far as I know, he's not dating anyone.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.531
I heard he plays poker
with some other execs,

09:32.531 --> 09:35.659
but he basically lives at the office.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.454
Come on, Stella. The guy's not a monk.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.625
Honestly, he kind of is.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.670
I heard he was hanging around Bradley
too much when she first got here.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.464
But, you know,
obviously that went nowhere.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.719
Well, okay then.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.722
I almost feel bad for the guy.
He has no idea what's coming.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.223
Yeah.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.327
Come in.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.246
- Hey.
- Thank you for making the time.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.791
Okay. Please tell me
that you're not going back to UBA.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.586
No, Elena. I'm not leaving NBN.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.964
Good. I mean, when you said
you wanted an off-the-books meeting,

10:30.964 --> 10:36.428
I was gearing up
to fight fucking Paul Marks. Jesus Christ.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.472
- It's not about that.
- Okay.

10:39.598 --> 10:40.432
Okay.

10:42.643 --> 10:46.104
So recently, I discovered something.

10:48.941 --> 10:54.112
It's big. I don't know if it's real,
but if I chase it...

10:57.991 --> 10:59.243
But?

11:00.661 --> 11:05.249
It could implicate someone close to you. Okay.

11:05.249 --> 11:10.212
And if I don't look into it,
and people find out that I knew...

11:10.212 --> 11:12.047
- Yeah.
- ...it would ruin my career.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.761
You know,
back before I went all corporate,

11:18.762 --> 11:20.180
I covered the Clinton impeachment.

11:20.180 --> 11:25.602
And my college roommate
was one of Ken Starr's top prosecutors.

11:25.602 --> 11:31.441
And she said something to me
one night over drinks, offhand.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.068
And...

11:34.862 --> 11:36.071
And you...

11:36.071 --> 11:39.741
I ran it down and reported it.

11:42.619 --> 11:46.081
Afterwards she accused me
of betraying her, which, well, I had.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.126
Because that's what we do as journalists.

11:49.126 --> 11:53.213
We shatter one moral code
to uphold the other.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.298
I just...

11:55.465 --> 11:57.176
I'm not sure I can do that.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.468
Look, if you're too close,

11:58.468 --> 12:01.889
if you wanna pass it off to someone
who does not have a personal connection--

12:01.889 --> 12:03.974
No, no. Thank you.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.520
- I'll handle it.
- All right.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.483
Well, let's find out if it's even real, okay?

12:14.610 --> 12:16.153
And then we will go from there.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.530
Okay.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.949
- Yeah, you got this.
- Thank you.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.789
Fuck.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.374
All right.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.337
- Earl, hit me.
- <i>No names yet.</i>

12:33.337 --> 12:36.131
Insider trading laws are a bitch.
Wish I could get in the mix.

12:36.131 --> 12:40.844
Come Friday, these mystery buyers,
they're gonna rake it in.

12:40.844 --> 12:45.516
<i>Buyer. My guy at Goldman told me
that one LLC is behind it all.</i>

12:46.683 --> 12:48.477
A single player, huh?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.688
Well,
someone is getting very, very greedy.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.565
<i>I'll keep chasing the name.</i>

12:54.066 --> 12:56.860
Yeah, you do that.

12:57.361 --> 13:01.240
- Kyle, is Paul still in the building?
- He's in back-to-backs with BA and Legal.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.616
Want me to try to get him?

13:04.660 --> 13:05.661
No, I'll find him.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.330
- I look forward to hearing about that.
- Great.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.373
Thank you very much.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.587
Hey, there he is.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.672
Cory.

13:16.672 --> 13:20.592
Paul. Hey, you see the proofs
for the thing the other day?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.302
- They just sent them over.
- I did not.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.595
What do you think? How do we look?

13:23.595 --> 13:26.723
Oh, yeah.
Like the titans of industry that we are.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.102
Well, about the other day.

13:30.102 --> 13:33.689
Whatever I said, I apologize.
Just one of those days.

13:34.398 --> 13:38.235
Hey, it's the private playing poor,
you know?

13:38.235 --> 13:40.988
They think they're doing you a favor.
Hey, real quick, while I got you.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.408
There's been some sizable
UBA stock purchases today.

13:44.408 --> 13:48.954
And I heard through the grapevine,
that there's one LLC behind them all.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.498
You don't have a buddy trying to get in
while the getting's good, do you?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.625
- No, nobody I know of.
- Right.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.920
I mean, doesn't really matter, right?
It's a formality at this point.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.047
- We already have the votes.
- Exactly.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.340
T-minus four days.

14:07.723 --> 14:08.807
Knock, knock.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.810
It's 10:30 in the morning.
You stalking me?

14:13.061 --> 14:16.899
- It's not our anniversary, is it? Shit.
- Oh, no. That's next week. You're good.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.775
Baby.

14:21.236 --> 14:26.033
My husband,
dropping by spontaneously with flowers.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.035
What Naima do?

14:28.702 --> 14:31.496
- I'm not buying another hamster.
- There's nothing wrong.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.916
- Don't play with me.
- Noth-- Nothing's wrong.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.000
Okay.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.921
I got a call
from your favorite sports network.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.381
They wanna set a meeting.
And they got it bad for you too.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.467
Frankly, I'm a little jealous.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.762
- Have they seen my social media?
- Of course.

14:46.762 --> 14:49.014
They love your voice, your passion.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.807
Or they wanna hire someone like me

14:50.807 --> 14:53.977
so they can appear to be making a change
without actually doing anything.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.855
Look, if you want to chase hard news,
we can negotiate that.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.733
Sports again?

15:00.234 --> 15:02.778
I mentioned that you want
to do the Brittney Griner special.

15:03.278 --> 15:06.698
They're all in. So what do you think?

15:08.492 --> 15:09.493
You wanna mix shit up?

15:13.705 --> 15:14.790
You don't need Paul Marks.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.307
Am I interrupting?

15:33.809 --> 15:35.644
- Maggie.
- Long time.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.188
What-- What brings you here?

15:38.772 --> 15:41.233
I was just talking to Leonard
about the acquisition.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.651
I'm doing a piece for <i>The Times</i>.

15:42.651 --> 15:47.865
Right. Right. Okay. Well, I sadly--
I don't have anything to add to that.

15:47.865 --> 15:50.325
I promise my tape recorder is off.
Can I come in?

15:52.536 --> 15:53.745
Wow.

15:56.248 --> 15:57.541
You've done well for yourself.

15:57.541 --> 16:02.087
I mean, first, a best-selling book,
then a hit show beloved by America.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.338
You're thriving.

16:03.338 --> 16:06.633
Well, you know,
it's been a busy few years.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.263
That is an understatement. Can I?

16:12.055 --> 16:14.975
- Of course.
- I won't stay long.

16:14.975 --> 16:18.187
- Okay.
- I just wanted to say hi.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.271
All right.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.649
I know we didn't leave things
on the best of terms,

16:23.650 --> 16:25.402
but I'm out of the shame business.

16:25.402 --> 16:30.157
I just wanted to say
that the things you've done,

16:30.157 --> 16:32.534
the changes you've made and undergone,

16:33.410 --> 16:34.703
have been impressive to watch.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.042
I'm sorry. I just--
That's not what I was expecting.

16:40.042 --> 16:43.795
I get it. I do. And I'll be the first
to admit that if this was a year ago,

16:43.795 --> 16:48.050
I probably would be standing here
asking you about your relationship

16:48.050 --> 16:50.802
with the aerospace billionaire
about to buy this company.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.263
But I'm more interested in the deal itself

16:53.263 --> 16:57.142
and what it portends for the future
of broadcast television.

16:57.893 --> 17:01.480
Well, I appreciate the olive branch.
I really do.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.612
Can I just ask--
and this is obviously off the record--

17:08.612 --> 17:10.614
- Okay.
- What's your plan?

17:11.949 --> 17:17.246
I mean, after this deal goes through,
do you keep working here under Cory?

17:22.209 --> 17:25.002
Yeah, well, I guess
I'm still f-- you know, figuring that out.

17:25.002 --> 17:30.717
I'm sure. And I'm sure everyone here is
relieved to be able to fight another day.

17:30.717 --> 17:35.597
Yeah. About that,
can I ask you a question off the record?

17:36.265 --> 17:37.099
Of course.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.518
With so much changing in the industry--

17:39.518 --> 17:41.395
I mean, once this deal goes through,

17:41.395 --> 17:46.024
what do you think UBA's
chances of survival are, long-term?

17:46.024 --> 17:49.570
What are the chances of any of
these legacy media companies surviving?

17:49.570 --> 17:53.657
I don't know how much you've heard,
but NBN is already facing cuts.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.951
Ten percent of the staff.
That's not a drop in the bucket.

17:56.952 --> 17:58.996
So, to answer your question,

17:58.996 --> 18:05.836
Paul Marks buying out UBA may keep the
doors open for three, maybe five years,

18:05.836 --> 18:11.717
but my guess is eventually the big three,
UBA, NBN, CBA,

18:12.342 --> 18:15.220
they cannibalize each other and die off.

18:16.054 --> 18:20.017
Regardless, I think you will do
great things here while you can.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.226
And I mean that.

18:23.228 --> 18:27.733
When the storm comes for us all,
let's hope we're both on high ground.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.237
And by the way, how's Bradley?

18:33.697 --> 18:37.451
Sh-- She's great, you know?
Fighting the fight.

18:37.451 --> 18:40.078
I just have to say that in all my years,

18:40.078 --> 18:43.790
I have never seen an anchor have
a colleague's back the way she had yours.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.210
That was really something.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.222
Hey, what do you got for me?

18:58.222 --> 19:01.266
<i>You were right.
The bankers lowballed the assets.</i>

19:01.266 --> 19:08.190
Fred said that it's closer to 20 bil
for sports, 30 for the studio and library.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.734
<i>Easiest 10 billion you'll ever make.</i>

19:10.734 --> 19:12.444
That gets Hyperion back on track.

19:12.945 --> 19:16.156
Speaking of, I got a call from Texas.

19:17.074 --> 19:20.369
Bradley Jackson's looking for dirt.
You don't think Alex--

19:20.369 --> 19:24.706
No, but keep an eye on Bradley, will you?

19:25.791 --> 19:29.253
- <i>Anything with Cory yet?</i>
- I'm still digging.

19:36.552 --> 19:38.095
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.471
- You're here late.
- I know.

19:39.471 --> 19:43.559
I just like wandering around
when no one's here staring or whispering.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.644
Oh, God, people suck.

19:45.644 --> 19:48.021
I know. They do.
Can I talk to you for a second?

19:48.021 --> 19:49.231
Sure.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.358
- Could we go in your office? Okay.
- Yeah.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.193
<i>- What's going on?
- Okay.</i>

19:54.778 --> 19:56.697
Can we keep this between us, please?

19:57.239 --> 19:58.490
Always. Yes.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.908
So I've been thinking a lot

19:59.908 --> 20:02.160
about what's gonna happen
once the deal goes through.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.204
What do you mean? What's gonna happen?

20:04.204 --> 20:05.455
Well, I--

20:06.081 --> 20:10.169
I think I wanna start my own thing.
Something completely new.

20:12.713 --> 20:16.341
I-- So you mean leaving UBA?

20:16.967 --> 20:18.093
It would mean leaving.

20:20.012 --> 20:22.598
Does this have anything to do
with you and Paul,

20:22.598 --> 20:26.351
- or you guys being together?
- No. No.

20:26.894 --> 20:30.272
Okay. 'Cause we talked
about making change here.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.356
That was--

20:31.857 --> 20:33.150
That was kinda the whole point.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.819
Yes, it was.
And it is, and it's still the point.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.988
And that's why-- that's why I'm here.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.240
I just think, as long as we're at UBA,

20:40.240 --> 20:43.243
we will always be working
underneath someone.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.037
We're at the height of our careers,

20:45.037 --> 20:47.956
and my show can get recut by Cory
whenever he wants?

20:47.956 --> 20:51.627
And you're on the evening news,
and you can't report on abortion?

20:51.627 --> 20:53.337
Really? What the fuck?

20:53.337 --> 20:56.965
And not to mention all the bullshit
that came out in light of the hack?

20:59.635 --> 21:01.720
So that's why I'm here. I--

21:01.720 --> 21:05.432
Bradley, I think you should come with me,
and I think we should do this.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.559
And we should start it from the ground up,

21:08.310 --> 21:10.187
you and I,
and just finish what we started.

21:10.687 --> 21:11.855
Wow.

21:14.149 --> 21:17.736
That is not what I thought
you were gonna say.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.530
Well, I mean, it sounds great,

21:20.322 --> 21:25.869
but I have a lot of work here to do at UBA
and a lot of commitments I've made.

21:25.869 --> 21:28.413
- Well--
- And if I'm gonna be completely candid,

21:30.207 --> 21:32.084
I think the wrong guy
is buying this place.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.546
The wrong guy is buying it?
What are you talking about?

21:35.546 --> 21:38.048
Listen, Alex,
something's going on at Hyperion.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.510
People are pissed, and it's about Paul.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.178
Okay.

21:43.178 --> 21:45.597
They're saying they don't like
how he operates his business.

21:45.597 --> 21:49.393
- Okay. Can you get a little more specific?
- How well do you know this guy?

21:50.686 --> 21:55.065
I mean, it feels like you guys started
dating, and all of a sudden, it went--

21:55.566 --> 21:58.068
Are you sure you really know who he is?

21:58.068 --> 21:59.152
What does that mean?

21:59.152 --> 22:01.405
- How well do you know him?
- I know him well--

22:01.405 --> 22:04.116
How well do you know him? Do you
even know what you're talking about?

22:04.116 --> 22:07.327
This guy is-- is--
This is a $40 billion deal.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.913
Do you know how much is at stake here?

22:09.913 --> 22:12.624
Of course, every Joe Schmo
is gonna come out of the woodwork

22:12.624 --> 22:15.210
and try to take him down,
talk shit about him.

22:15.210 --> 22:19.047
- I think it's a little more than that.
- Are you f-- serious? Don't be so naive.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.216
And honestly,
do you have anything specific?

22:21.216 --> 22:23.969
Do you have actual evidence
on what you're saying here?

22:23.969 --> 22:25.470
Look, Alex, I think--

22:25.971 --> 22:26.972
No?

22:28.223 --> 22:30.058
I think it's hard for you
to be objective about this.

22:30.058 --> 22:32.769
Oh, my God. Wow, people really do suck.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.564
I can't believe that, coming from you.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.065
Honestly.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.276
Alex, come on.

22:39.276 --> 22:42.654
I'm saying this because I care about you.
I'm actually worried about you.

22:42.654 --> 22:45.782
Okay, well, I'm really glad
you said something

22:45.782 --> 22:47.910
because I wouldn't have known otherwise.

22:49.036 --> 22:49.870
Goddamn it.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.872
Jesus Christ.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.382
<i>Hello?</i>

23:02.382 --> 23:03.675
Hi. It's Laura.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.930
Hey, Laura. Is Bradley okay?

23:07.930 --> 23:11.058
Yes, she's fine.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

23:11.058 --> 23:13.101
Oh, no-- No, no. I'm jus--

23:13.101 --> 23:17.022
Well, I'm headed in my home group.
But I got a minute. What's up?

23:17.022 --> 23:21.527
I was thinking that we could all
get together for Fourth of July weekend.

23:21.527 --> 23:23.237
You, me, Bradley, Cheryl.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.533
Yeah, th-- yeah, that'd be good.

23:28.033 --> 23:31.828
Well, you won't believe how big
Taylor's getting. She's already walking.

23:33.413 --> 23:36.416
Yeah. So,
I have to cover the parade in DC.

23:37.084 --> 23:38.335
Why don't you meet us there?

23:40.796 --> 23:42.965
Great. That sounds-- That sounds fun.

23:42.965 --> 23:44.216
Have you ever been?

23:45.342 --> 23:46.343
To DC?

23:50.722 --> 23:51.890
Not since high school.

23:53.642 --> 23:57.062
<i>Yeah, I've been meaning to.
I just never got around to it.</i>

23:59.731 --> 24:02.860
You'll love it.
The fireworks are incredible.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.945
<i>Great. That sounds amazing.</i>

24:05.571 --> 24:06.905
All right. We'll see you then.

24:17.708 --> 24:18.876
Hi, baby.

24:19.376 --> 24:21.753
Hey, sweet boy. Hey, sweet baby.

24:48.155 --> 24:51.325
Hey. Perfect timing.
The food just got here.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.211
- What's up?
- I'm ready.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.880
- You're ready?
- Oh, yeah.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.298
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.050
Great.

25:17.476 --> 25:19.478
He's behind schedule and out of money.

25:19.478 --> 25:21.563
Chip just talked to a foreman
that works down there.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.857
He and his crew have been working
on Hyperion through the night

25:23.857 --> 25:24.942
and not being paid for it.

25:24.942 --> 25:28.028
Building rockets, guys. Come on.
It's fucking hard.

25:28.028 --> 25:30.489
Of course he's behind schedule. Come on.

25:30.489 --> 25:33.992
My friend worked for Paul a dozen years.
She's an aerospace engineer.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.828
Last week, he fired her
for raising safety concerns.

25:36.828 --> 25:40.999
She came to me to blow the whistle, and
then something or someone silenced her.

25:40.999 --> 25:43.752
And that's what we're hearing from
every engineer we talk to at Hyperion.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.838
Paul is hiding something, Cory.

25:45.838 --> 25:49.007
And it's bad enough that nobody wants
to talk about it. They're all scared.

25:49.007 --> 25:52.427
The guy has invented
all kinds of proprietary tech.

25:52.427 --> 25:55.138
I would imagine
that he is anxious to protect it.

25:55.138 --> 25:58.392
I'm guessing you haven't read the
after-action report on the cyberattack?

25:58.392 --> 25:59.977
I was waiting for the CliffNotes.

25:59.977 --> 26:03.814
Victor says the transmission failure
during the launch was on Hyperion's end,

26:03.814 --> 26:04.898
not ours.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.817
Something went wrong,
and instead of reporting it,

26:06.817 --> 26:09.736
- Paul blamed it on our cyberattack.
- We were on that rocket.

26:09.736 --> 26:13.407
- And we were fine.
- Were we?

26:13.407 --> 26:15.284
Or was her friend trying to warn us?

26:15.284 --> 26:17.494
Or maybe that's what all the engineers
are scared about,

26:17.494 --> 26:19.413
because something bad
could have happened, Cory.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.915
We have to delay the vote.
We need more time.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.250
Only the board can delay the vote,

26:23.250 --> 26:25.752
and I can guarantee you they're not
gonna do it for a bunch of maybes.

26:30.549 --> 26:32.301
All right.
Well, I'm gonna keep chasing this.

26:32.301 --> 26:33.844
I expect nothing less.

26:37.681 --> 26:41.894
I should have taken a harder stand against
him from the beginning of all of this.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.646
I didn't trust myself. That's on me.

26:44.646 --> 26:48.192
Stella, come on. You're gonna be fine.

26:48.192 --> 26:50.819
Once the deal goes through,
you're gonna be more than fine.

26:50.819 --> 26:53.405
You're gonna have more resources
than you know what to do with.

26:57.534 --> 27:00.954
You make people feel anything is possible.

27:01.622 --> 27:04.458
It's really effective.
It's probably why I took this job.

27:05.375 --> 27:09.338
Paul does the same thing,
that anything-is-possible act.

27:09.338 --> 27:12.132
But it isn't real, Cory.
It's all smoke and mirrors.

27:12.132 --> 27:14.968
And I thought that was a difference
between you two, but now I'm not so sure.

27:15.719 --> 27:19.014
I know we have to find a way
to keep the doors open,

27:19.598 --> 27:22.768
but he's infected you. He does that.

27:22.768 --> 27:26.855
He's like a virus,
and I have already survived the plague.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.232
So, yeah...

27:30.359 --> 27:31.527
I'm gonna be fine.

27:32.027 --> 27:34.738
Because after the deal goes through,
I won't be here.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.156
I just want you to know that.

27:42.746 --> 27:49.211
Cory crossed a line. Seriously, this is
some fucking McCarthy-era bullshit.

27:50.921 --> 27:55.592
Turns out, the night manager at
the Archer Gray doesn't delete anything.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.929
- He has quite the treasure trove.
- Nice work. And Bradley?

27:58.929 --> 28:02.474
She will get someone to talk.
If that someone is Kate--

28:02.474 --> 28:04.393
Well, let's make sure that it isn't.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.437
They think she took some things
when she left.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.858
Records, logs. It could follow us.

28:13.443 --> 28:15.445
Find out and kill it.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.200
Hey.

28:24.288 --> 28:28.417
I brought you some cookies. I thought
they might cheer you up a little bit.

28:29.376 --> 28:32.713
Are you okay? Do you need to see a doctor?
I don't care if you're contagious.

28:32.713 --> 28:35.507
- I'm giving you a hug. What? What?
- No.

28:35.507 --> 28:36.592
Stay away.

28:37.342 --> 28:38.177
What happened?

28:40.012 --> 28:41.346
You should have fucked him.

28:42.556 --> 28:45.142
- What?
- Cory. You should have just fucked him.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.227
At least I could wrap my head around that.

28:47.227 --> 28:48.979
I don't understand. You're--

28:49.730 --> 28:52.691
- You're kinda scaring me, Laura.
- Hal's a terrorist, but I'm scaring you?

29:01.283 --> 29:05.370
I didn't wanna believe it.
I tried so, so hard not to believe it.

29:05.370 --> 29:08.916
Bradley to the rescue. You cleaned up
his mess like you always do.

29:08.916 --> 29:13.712
Look, I--
I wanted to tell you so many times.

29:13.712 --> 29:16.632
So it's true. It's really true.

29:17.508 --> 29:19.676
- Just let me--
- Don't, don't!

29:19.676 --> 29:24.973
- I will lose my shit. Back the fuck off.
- Okay. All right. Okay. Okay.

29:27.893 --> 29:28.977
That fucking pin.

29:30.896 --> 29:33.232
- What?
- Fucking Geraldine Ferraro.

29:33.899 --> 29:38.070
- I thought you and Cory were--
- No. Laura, no. Never ever.

29:38.070 --> 29:41.823
He lied to the FBI. For you.

29:43.825 --> 29:44.826
That's love.

29:44.826 --> 29:48.413
I'm dreaming about being with you
in Montana

29:48.413 --> 29:52.084
while you're sharing this thing with him.

29:52.084 --> 29:56.505
Look, let me just explain.
I just-- I want to explain to you.

29:56.505 --> 29:59.424
I know I made a huge mistake. I know it.

30:00.008 --> 30:03.053
But what you don't understand
is I had to make a choice.

30:03.053 --> 30:07.474
- I couldn't let Hal ruin his life.
- So you ruined ours?

30:07.474 --> 30:11.144
- No, he didn't mean to hurt that cop.
- Oh, my God. Bradley,

30:11.144 --> 30:15.983
he attacked a police officer? Jesus.
What is wrong with you?

30:15.983 --> 30:18.151
- I know.
- My God. That's why you d--

30:18.151 --> 30:22.072
Oh, no, no, no. What am I think--
No, you wanted <i>Evening News</i>.

30:22.072 --> 30:24.199
- Oh, my God. I almost forgot that part.
- That is not fair.

30:24.199 --> 30:25.617
Oh, fuck fair.

30:25.617 --> 30:27.286
You fucking broke every rule.

30:27.286 --> 30:30.581
How do you sit in that chair every night?

30:31.415 --> 30:32.916
It is obscene.

30:34.793 --> 30:38.213
Trust me, I know, but I'm gonna
make it right. I promise you.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.464
That's such a lie.

30:39.464 --> 30:41.675
Everything about you is a lie.

30:41.675 --> 30:43.051
I'm sorry.

30:45.679 --> 30:48.390
- I'm sorry.
- You need to leave. Get out of here.

30:48.390 --> 30:51.310
- N--
- I'm not calling the FBI.

30:51.310 --> 30:53.437
- I'm not reporting any of this.
- No--

30:53.437 --> 30:57.941
I want nothing to do with it,
and I want nothing to do with you.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.194
- No. I'll do anything, Laura.
- I am done with you.

31:00.194 --> 31:01.737
I'll do anything to make it better.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.822
- Just tell me what I can do.
- Bradley, you'll be fine.

31:03.822 --> 31:05.449
You're a survivor.

31:05.449 --> 31:07.826
You'll do anything, right?
That's what you do.

31:08.452 --> 31:12.206
Now get out before I change my mind.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.759
Please, Laura. Plea--

31:30.390 --> 31:32.226
I thought we would get old together.

31:34.603 --> 31:35.604
I really did.

32:09.763 --> 32:12.474
- Hello, Kyle.
- Is he expecting you?

32:12.474 --> 32:17.354
- Not at all.
- Wow, Cybil, what a surprise.

32:18.605 --> 32:21.525
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
You forgot your white hood, right?

32:21.525 --> 32:23.652
I'll have Kyle check the lost and found, okay?

32:23.652 --> 32:28.031
Do you know, when you became CEO,
my expectations were low.

32:28.615 --> 32:31.201
It turns out, I overestimated you.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.161
You missed me.

32:33.161 --> 32:37.457
Whatever Paul Marks is paying
for the possession of your soul,

32:37.457 --> 32:38.667
I will double it.

32:39.543 --> 32:40.544
Name your price.

32:40.544 --> 32:44.089
You want a chunk of my new shares?
They're yours.

32:45.424 --> 32:48.260
Well, mystery solved.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.345
I had my money on Miss Scarlet,

32:50.345 --> 32:53.682
and it turns out it was Mrs. White
in the conservatory with an LLC.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.393
Did you really think that I would sit back

32:56.393 --> 33:00.105
while a bunch of thugs
destroy my family's company?

33:00.105 --> 33:02.566
You don't have the votes to stop the sale.

33:02.566 --> 33:03.859
Yet,

33:04.610 --> 33:08.197
I will keep fighting till the bitter end.
Believe me.

33:08.197 --> 33:10.407
Cybil, by this time Friday,

33:10.407 --> 33:13.785
UBA will be the biggest network
in the country,

33:13.785 --> 33:16.163
with the widest reach
and the deepest pockets.

33:16.163 --> 33:18.832
You need to embrace the inevitable.

33:18.832 --> 33:22.252
This is a win.

33:23.253 --> 33:24.505
Oh, my God.

33:25.881 --> 33:26.924
You don't know.

33:28.509 --> 33:31.011
- You really don't know.
- No, what don't I know?

33:31.011 --> 33:34.556
Okay. Okay.

33:34.556 --> 33:39.353
I ran into Genevieve Micklen the other day
at the salon.

33:40.187 --> 33:41.563
And normally, I avoid her.

33:41.563 --> 33:45.776
I mean, who cares about her horses
and her ridiculous blond highlights?

33:45.776 --> 33:47.778
But she had words for me,

33:48.695 --> 33:51.615
and she was all too happy
to rub it in my face.

33:51.615 --> 33:52.950
Okay. What are you talking about?

33:52.950 --> 33:56.411
Paul Marks is stripping the network
for parts,

33:57.704 --> 33:59.790
and Fred is helping him price the sale.

34:00.791 --> 34:05.629
Sports division, content library,
the studio, the news.

34:06.296 --> 34:09.257
They're dismantling the entire company,

34:10.217 --> 34:13.846
including your precious streamer.

34:15.472 --> 34:16.974
Do I have your attention now?

34:21.562 --> 34:22.855
Have a nice day, Cybil.

34:42.623 --> 34:43.876
<i>I'm not around.</i>

34:59.433 --> 35:00.893
Fuck!

35:19.745 --> 35:20.746
Hey, Isabella.

35:20.746 --> 35:21.830
Hi, Cory.

35:25.209 --> 35:26.293
We don't knock anymore?

35:26.293 --> 35:28.295
- Are you part of this?
- A part of what?

35:28.295 --> 35:29.755
Oh, fuck.

35:30.797 --> 35:33.425
- Are you bleeding?
- Yeah, you are. Of course you are.

35:33.425 --> 35:36.428
Hey, when Paul stood up
in front of the news division

35:36.428 --> 35:39.348
and he said that he would keep his hands
to himself, you were all fired up.

35:39.348 --> 35:42.643
You wanted to protect democracy,
preserve the fourth estate.

35:42.643 --> 35:44.186
Did you know the plan then?

35:44.186 --> 35:47.731
Or did you hash it out
while you were lying together in bed?

35:47.731 --> 35:50.275
Goddamn it, Alex. Oh, fuck me!

35:50.275 --> 35:53.612
Couldn't you have just slashed my tires?

35:53.612 --> 35:58.784
Any goddamn thing
except killing the entire fucking company.

35:58.784 --> 36:01.328
Wow. Wow. And I'm so dumb.

36:01.328 --> 36:05.666
Here I thought the never-ending fucking
pandemic was our biggest threat.

36:06.583 --> 36:11.046
But no, it-- that-- it was in fa--
It's you and your boyfriend.

36:11.046 --> 36:13.966
How is it,
everything that held us together--

36:13.966 --> 36:17.678
it-- just gone?

36:17.678 --> 36:18.762
Fuck me.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.598
Okay, well, yeah.
No, you are actually right about this.

36:21.598 --> 36:24.601
It is time to smash and shatter.

36:24.601 --> 36:27.437
Let's burn it all down,
'cause who gives a fuck?

36:27.437 --> 36:30.232
Let's peddle conspiracy theories and--

36:30.232 --> 36:32.818
and scream at flight attendants,

36:32.818 --> 36:35.904
and shoot up grocery stores
and subway cars.

36:35.904 --> 36:39.116
Someone out there has got to pay
for our suffering!

36:42.536 --> 36:43.745
Oh, my God.

36:44.830 --> 36:46.748
Oh, my God.

36:46.748 --> 36:49.626
Do you know how many of these
I've had to sit through?

36:51.253 --> 36:53.672
I'm so sick
of your self-righteous monologues, Cory.

36:54.673 --> 36:56.466
I didn't kill anything.

36:56.466 --> 36:58.677
I've never had the power to kill anything.

37:00.470 --> 37:03.265
I asked for a seat at that table.
You didn't give me a seat at that table.

37:03.265 --> 37:07.269
And let me remind you, back in Texas,
when you so kindly educated me

37:07.269 --> 37:12.357
that half of the streaming services were
gonna be bought up or gone in five years,

37:13.442 --> 37:16.612
you said, "This ship is sinking.
Get on board with Paul Marks."

37:16.612 --> 37:18.030
So, I got on board with Paul Marks.

37:18.030 --> 37:20.032
You said,
"You've got to be nice to Paul Marks."

37:20.032 --> 37:23.368
Not that fucking nice, Alex.

37:23.368 --> 37:27.873
- My God. There are 20,000 employees here.
- Don't you fucking dare...

37:29.875 --> 37:34.046
pretend like you give a shit about anybody
else in this building but yourself.

37:34.046 --> 37:38.258
I've seen the books.
There's nothing left to save.

37:38.258 --> 37:40.177
You were right. Nothing to save.

37:40.969 --> 37:42.930
Can you take responsibility

37:42.930 --> 37:45.307
for one fucking thing
that goes on in this building?

37:46.600 --> 37:49.937
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have a company to build.

37:52.105 --> 37:54.858
And those employees
that you say you give a shit about

37:54.858 --> 37:57.194
that you definitely
don't give a shit about?

37:57.694 --> 38:00.864
They're coming with me, and I will
be paying them what they deserve.

38:08.163 --> 38:11.500
Yes, Leonard! The whole fucking company,
lock, stock and barrel.

38:12.376 --> 38:15.212
She'll sell the furniture in the boardroom
by the time this is all over.

38:15.212 --> 38:16.797
Hey, get me some fucking ice!

38:18.257 --> 38:20.592
Leonard. Leonard.

38:20.592 --> 38:23.887
Leonard, take a breath, please.
You're stammering like an idiot.

38:23.887 --> 38:27.182
Well, I just had a low-stress, respectful,
life-affirming conversation

38:27.182 --> 38:29.685
with Cory Ellison. He knows, Paul.

38:30.185 --> 38:31.937
Yeah. Sorry you had to deal with that.

38:31.937 --> 38:33.689
It's bad. This is really bad.

38:34.648 --> 38:38.068
- You know he's gonna hit back.
- <i>Yeah, well, he can try.</i>

38:38.569 --> 38:40.529
This is exactly
what we didn't want to have happen.

38:40.529 --> 38:43.073
Okay. Look,
it's no surprise that he's pissed off.

38:43.073 --> 38:45.325
There's gonna be a lot of that
going around in the next few weeks.

38:45.325 --> 38:48.161
I know. I know. I wanna go home.

38:48.161 --> 38:49.788
All right.
I'll see you there as soon as I can.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.123
Okay. Bye.

39:07.514 --> 39:08.599
Take me to UBA.

39:08.599 --> 39:12.519
Call a board meeting tonight.
Get everyone here.

39:12.519 --> 39:15.230
They need to know
what's about to happen on their watch.

39:16.899 --> 39:20.110
We need to shut this down right now.

39:20.110 --> 39:22.237
Thank you, Kyle. I'll keep the ice.
Thank you.

39:46.470 --> 39:47.971
Gayle, I just need a minute.

39:52.851 --> 39:53.936
Hey.

39:56.063 --> 39:57.064
Hey.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.608
- What are you doing here?
- I just--

39:59.608 --> 40:02.653
I had the chance to talk to quite a few
of your colleagues.

40:03.153 --> 40:04.655
Haven't really had a chance
to talk to you.

40:04.655 --> 40:06.406
Not since Texas anyway.

40:06.990 --> 40:10.202
Okay, well, I don't have time to talk.

40:10.202 --> 40:12.162
- I have to get back out there.
- This won't take long.

40:12.162 --> 40:13.664
All right. Well, I have 30 seconds.

40:13.664 --> 40:15.916
Okay. Well, then...

40:16.416 --> 40:19.002
I know you're investigating Hyperion

40:19.002 --> 40:23.423
and talking to some of my engineers
and asking people to violate NDAs.

40:23.423 --> 40:25.300
Your company's in serious trouble.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.469
You're out of money.

40:27.469 --> 40:30.013
And what you're doing is not safe.
You're trying to silence people.

40:30.013 --> 40:33.809
Yeah. And if you had anything to back
that up, you would have already run it.

40:34.476 --> 40:38.021
Someone's gonna talk.
It's just a matter of time.

40:40.357 --> 40:43.902
- How's your brother?
- What?

40:45.320 --> 40:46.321
Bradley, now.

40:46.864 --> 40:48.323
No, I just need one minute.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.914
Cue the pretape.
Something's off with Bradley.

40:56.415 --> 40:59.626
Your brother, Hal. How's he doing?

40:59.626 --> 41:02.421
Does his wife know what you did
for him at the Capitol?

41:04.923 --> 41:07.801
I mean, conspiracy, sedition,

41:09.219 --> 41:13.932
lying to the FBI,
these are all really serious charges.

41:13.932 --> 41:16.894
You and Cory really went all in,
didn't you?

41:17.561 --> 41:20.230
And then there's Laura's exposure
to this too.

41:20.230 --> 41:24.401
Geez, she knew about it,
and she didn't report it.

41:24.985 --> 41:27.821
That's the kind of thing
that really ruins somebody's credibility.

41:27.821 --> 41:30.824
- Don't bring Laura into this.
- See, I think you already did.

41:32.284 --> 41:35.954
But you can protect her. And your brother.

41:35.954 --> 41:38.081
You can make it all go away.

41:44.755 --> 41:46.006
Food for thought.

41:48.217 --> 41:49.218
Have a good show.

42:11.198 --> 42:14.117
In five, four, three...

42:15.577 --> 42:19.289
<i>Russian President Vladimir Putin
marked Victory Day on Monday,</i>

42:19.289 --> 42:22.876
the anniversary of the Soviet Union's
defeat of Nazi Germany,

42:22.876 --> 42:27.548
with a speech in Red Square
defending the current invasion of Ukraine.

42:27.548 --> 42:32.803
Putin maintained that what he calls
"a special military operation"

42:32.803 --> 42:35.722
is essential to rebuke Western aggression.

42:35.722 --> 42:38.433
President Biden made a final push to...

42:40.519 --> 42:41.520
finals...

42:42.896 --> 42:43.981
I'm sorry.

42:46.441 --> 42:47.442
I'm just...

42:48.902 --> 42:51.280
Bradley, get back to the prompter.

42:55.659 --> 42:56.952
The prompter, Bradley.

43:04.209 --> 43:10.174
I just-- I wanted to make a difference. Somehow.

43:10.174 --> 43:15.012
I wanna help those people who feel small.

43:16.305 --> 43:17.306
And forgotten.

43:17.306 --> 43:19.892
Bradley, what are you doing?

43:19.892 --> 43:21.727
<i>And during these last three years,</i>

43:21.727 --> 43:23.437
there are so many people here
at this network

43:23.437 --> 43:25.606
who have supported me in that mission.

43:25.606 --> 43:28.775
And I wanna thank a few of them.
Mia Jordan.

43:28.775 --> 43:29.943
Please stop talking.

43:30.527 --> 43:36.158
<i>Charles Black, Gayle Burns, Stella Bak
and Alex Levy.</i>

43:36.992 --> 43:37.993
What?

43:37.993 --> 43:42.998
<i>And I wanna thank you, our viewers,
for allowing me the honor</i>

43:44.124 --> 43:49.296
of being in your living room every night
and sharing the news with you.

43:49.963 --> 43:53.800
It has been my privilege.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.969
It has been a dream come true.

43:56.720 --> 44:00.390
Effective immediately, I'm resigning
from UBA for personal reasons.

44:01.391 --> 44:03.185
This will be my final broadcast.

44:03.936 --> 44:08.398
Thank you for watching.
Stay safe, and good night.

44:14.363 --> 44:16.281
Jump out of this. Cut to commercial.

44:25.207 --> 44:27.501
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Hey.

44:28.252 --> 44:30.087
Bradley! What's going on?

44:31.380 --> 44:34.758
- Bradley?
- Stop! Hey, talk to me.

44:34.758 --> 44:37.010
I can't. I can't. I gotta go.

44:37.678 --> 44:41.723
Hey, I need to know what's happening.
Bradley! Bradley!

44:42.766 --> 44:44.476
You got anything?
She's not picking up her cell.

44:44.476 --> 44:46.228
Tried her office. She's not picking up.

44:47.479 --> 44:48.814
Where the fuck is she?

44:50.399 --> 44:53.443
<i>Times</i> called, NBN called, Bloomberg.
What do I tell them?

44:53.443 --> 44:55.571
Tell 'em I don't know what the fuck
is going on with Bradley,

44:55.571 --> 44:58.156
that I'm having a series
of moderate to severe panic attacks,

44:58.156 --> 45:00.742
and that Alex Levy and the billionaire
that she's boning

45:00.742 --> 45:05.080
are about to sell our company for parts
before our own very fucking eyes.

45:06.206 --> 45:08.333
- So tell them...
- Nothing. Tell them nothing.

45:08.333 --> 45:11.003
Can you at least find out
if Bradley is still in the building?

45:13.881 --> 45:15.883
- Did you see it?
- Yes, uh-huh, I did see it.

45:15.883 --> 45:17.676
Did you talk to her or did--
What did she say?

45:18.468 --> 45:19.970
No, not that. This.

45:19.970 --> 45:21.054
What is this?

45:21.054 --> 45:22.806
<i>The Vault</i>. It just dropped.

45:23.724 --> 45:26.476
They're saying
that you were grooming Bradley.

45:26.476 --> 45:28.896
That you put her in the same hotel
that you were staying at,

45:28.896 --> 45:31.231
managing her rise at UBA.

45:31.732 --> 45:36.653
When she rejected you, you retaliated
by outing Bradley and Laura.

45:36.653 --> 45:39.448
Paul fucking Marks.

45:39.448 --> 45:40.824
Cory, is it true?

45:44.369 --> 45:47.247
- Now what?
- Security's on their way up.

45:47.247 --> 45:49.124
They've been told to escort you
out of the building.
