WEBVTT

00:13.388 --> 00:15.348
-[rock music playing]
-[panting]

01:07.025 --> 01:08.610
What are we gonna do?

01:10.737 --> 01:14.741
Hmm, we're gonna go back
to STAR Labs and tell them
what happened.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.210
You weren't gonna kill him?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.130
No.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.091
Which now means
the end of the world is on me.

01:35.845 --> 01:41.601
Hey, that vision you had...
I was there, too.
Like, I saw it.

01:44.854 --> 01:47.106
All of us, together
at the park?

01:48.274 --> 01:49.651
Yeah.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.696
I know this is, like,
none of my business,

01:53.780 --> 01:55.365
and there's a lot
going on right now,

01:55.448 --> 01:58.451
but I think that's why
I need to say something...

02:00.537 --> 02:03.164
In Gotham, in the Lazarus Pit,

02:03.248 --> 02:08.211
when I was sucking up
all the nightmares,
I saw what Dick saw.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.213
What are you talking about?

02:10.296 --> 02:14.926
Dick had a vision, too,
and it was, pretty much
exactly like yours.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.097
The little girl?

02:20.265 --> 02:22.725
With the red balloon.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.186
I don't know if he's talked
to you about this.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.729
No, he hasn't.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.949
[Sebastian shuddering]

02:46.416 --> 02:47.876
What's happening to me?

02:47.959 --> 02:49.919
You're transitioning.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.423
You started the process
when you said the words.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.092
Now, you must drink
from the Well of Blood

02:56.175 --> 02:58.595
and submerge your body in it
to gain peace.

02:58.678 --> 03:02.307
Until you do that,
your misery will only grow.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.809
No. No, I can't.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.146
I won't.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.941
I only came with you
to stop you from
killing my friends.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.611
Just leave me alone.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.533
-Is he ready?
-Not yet.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.745
We're running out of time.
If we don't complete
the ritual soon...

03:23.828 --> 03:25.663
He must come to
the Well of Blood willingly.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.832
-And if he doesn't?
-He will.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.001
I have a plan.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.253
He will.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.799
[Jinx] Oh, hey. Look at you.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.511
-[Tim] Hey, Gar-virus.
-Almost human-sized again.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.846
[Tim] Yeah, yeah.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.641
How's Conner?

03:44.724 --> 03:46.935
I'm not sure, he keeps
calling me "home slice".

03:47.018 --> 03:50.605
Well, he said
I'm hotter than last July,
so, I'd say he's fine.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.607
Are you sure he's clean?
From the curse?

03:52.690 --> 03:54.776
Mmm, he's clean, all right.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.195
I checked him up one side
and down the other.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.404
[Tim chuckling] Good for you.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.495
Where's Sebastian?

04:07.080 --> 04:12.085
He sacrificed himself
to save us.
She has him now.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.838
As far as we know,
this temple could be on
the top of Mount Everest.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.508
And even if we do find it,
how do we get him out of there?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.134
We could teleport.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.761
Or that's not a thing?

04:21.844 --> 04:24.472
And this is all assuming
the ritual hasn't
already happened.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.557
-If it has--
-We're fucked.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.850
The whole world is fucked.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.811
We gotta still
believe there's a chance.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.521
A chance to save him.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.481
Yes, anything less
is a failure.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.899
-So what's our move?
-[door opens]

04:38.403 --> 04:40.530
Something happened to...
to your head?

04:40.613 --> 04:42.615
[sniffing]
Are you wearing cologne?

04:42.699 --> 04:43.825
[Kory coughs]

04:43.908 --> 04:47.203
It's Drakkar Noir.
You're welcome.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.792
If you're all done
taking in the view...

04:54.127 --> 04:55.461
[exhales]

04:56.212 --> 04:57.338
Grab a seat.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.341
We've got a demon to stop.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.139
[theme music playing]

05:16.983 --> 05:19.819
The Blood Moon sets
in two hours and six minutes.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.821
What's your big idea?

05:21.904 --> 05:27.410
It's a three-step process.
We find them, kill them,
and go have a cold one.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.412
-Hot take.
-We're not doing that.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.749
I am done playing
demon rescue-and-rehab.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.085
This bitch killed my dad
and put a snake up my guts.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.920
It's time for her
and the kid to go bye-bye.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.964
She's on high alert.
It's too dangerous.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.550
We need to find a way
to bring Sebastian back
without a head-on battle.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.427
[Conner] There's an old saying,
Richard.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.305
"He, who doesn't
learn from history is a..."

05:47.388 --> 05:51.976
What is it? Oh, yeah,
a fucking moron.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.603
If we killed him
when we had the chance,

05:53.686 --> 05:55.772
we'd all be in the RV
heading to 'Frisco right now.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.356
Don't call it 'Frisco.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.816
We don't kill people, Conner.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.485
We're not murderers.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.237
[scoffs] Got it. Except for
all the people you've murdered.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.448
Like the ones
you burned alive
in the asylum,

06:05.531 --> 06:07.492
which caused
this whole mess
in the first place.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.160
-That was different.
-Hey!

06:09.243 --> 06:11.913
I'm not complaining.
Shit happens.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.791
Sometimes, people die.
It's not always a bad thing.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.584
We're not killing Sebastian.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.795
Even Bruce figured it out,
eventually.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.798
Do you know how many people
The Joker killed since
Batman bashed his head in?

06:24.842 --> 06:25.802
Zero.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.138
Zero. I like that kind of math.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.729
[breathing heavily]

06:38.064 --> 06:39.148
[sniffles]

07:09.262 --> 07:11.180
[breathing heavily]

07:13.724 --> 07:16.352
[Conner]
Looks like you're not
all the way back yet, are you?

07:16.435 --> 07:18.688
No, I guess not.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.325
Looks like you're not
all the way back yet, are you?

07:54.056 --> 07:57.727
I can't do this. I won't.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.733
Deep inside, you know,
the life you've led

08:03.816 --> 08:06.068
is not the life you're
meant to lead.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.615
There are so many
memories hidden,

08:10.698 --> 08:13.492
because they're too painful
to remember.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.369
Are you ready to see them now?

08:28.507 --> 08:30.384
This is your home now,
Sebastian.

08:32.345 --> 08:36.098
And this... is your room.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.018
Just for me?

08:41.103 --> 08:45.775
Oh, and here's a little
"welcome home" gift.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.987
I've seen other children
your age play with these,

08:50.071 --> 08:53.157
uh, although, I have to say,
I don't really understand
how they work.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.160
I hope you do.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.579
[Mother Mayhem] You were
very happy for a time...

09:00.623 --> 09:02.959
but then, your guardian
made a mistake.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.755
This is your home now, Lila.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.725
She'll need your bedroom,
Sabbie.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.396
It's warmer in here and...

09:23.479 --> 09:27.233
She's not well.
You understand, don't you?

09:33.197 --> 09:34.448
Come here, love.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.081
Do you know what that is, Lila?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.211
Why don't you let her
have a try, Sabbie?

10:03.602 --> 10:06.230
Thank you. You're a good boy.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.111
[Mother Mayhem]
Do you know what really
happened that day?

10:15.948 --> 10:20.369
You were punished
because you were stronger
than her.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.081
But she was sick. I wasn't.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.042
Was that your fault?

10:26.125 --> 10:29.170
You had done nothing wrong.

10:29.253 --> 10:33.341
Your strength should have been
rewarded, not her weakness.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.439
Hey, excuse me.
Have you seen Conner?

10:48.522 --> 10:50.399
Are you kidding? Take a look.

10:51.650 --> 10:54.487
Bernard, I need
orbital elements.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.406
I gotta see what
I'm working with, you feel me?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.408
I feel you, Mr. Kent.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.828
I think we can stop with
the "Mr. Kent" business,
don't you?

11:02.912 --> 11:06.332
Just call me Conner.
Or Mr. Luthor.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.544
All right, Conner.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.921
What the hell is going on?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.506
[sarcastically] Ask Mr. Luthor.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.467
I am taking away the moon.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.594
I accessed LexCorp's mainframe.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.429
We're redirecting 58
of their satellites

11:20.513 --> 11:22.390
to reflect sunlight
back onto the moon.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.267
It'll basically erase
the illusion that
the moon's turning red.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.729
No Blood Moon, no blood ritual.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.440
Okay, everyone, listen up.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.609
Once we're fully online,
I'm gonna need thrusters

11:33.692 --> 11:37.988
on all satellites
beyond 249.3 degrees East,

11:38.072 --> 11:40.408
all the way up. Got it?

11:40.491 --> 11:42.201
[people acknowledging]

11:42.284 --> 11:44.203
Hey, uh, Conner,
can I talk to you for a second?

11:44.286 --> 11:46.455
Kind of busy, Richard.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.624
We're down
to one hour, 46 minutes.

11:48.707 --> 11:49.834
Please don't call me Richard.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.920
You actually prefer Dick?

11:53.003 --> 11:55.506
The last person to call me that
was Lex Luthor.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.716
Then he sent six ninjas
to kill me and Tim,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.176
so yeah, I actually
prefer Dick.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.138
Okay.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.307
You know he wasn't
actually trying
to kill you, right?

12:05.391 --> 12:06.642
He was just sending a message.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.810
How do you know?

12:07.893 --> 12:09.311
'Cause if he were trying
to kill you,

12:09.395 --> 12:11.814
he would have rigged the room
with explosives.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.693
That's what I would have done,
if I wanted to kill you.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.823
Look, Conner,
you've been through
a lot, lately.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.241
An hour ago, we thought
you were dead.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.243
-Why don't you take some time--
-No time.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.370
If we don't re-position
these satellites now,
we miss our chance.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.457
-Thoughts?
-About Conner?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.667
That something is
definitely wrong.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.920
It's like, the "Lex"
side of him is taking over,

12:35.004 --> 12:38.424
which, of course, means that
this satellite idea

12:38.507 --> 12:39.884
is probably going to work.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.349
All right, go for it.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.977
Thank you. Sir.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.023
I knew you'd see it my way...

12:55.107 --> 12:56.817
Dick.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.820
By the way, how's your,
uh, "non-confrontational,

12:59.904 --> 13:02.490
let's just sneak Sebastian
out the back door of the temple

13:02.573 --> 13:05.034
while May Bennet's looking
the other way" plan going?

13:05.117 --> 13:08.078
Hey, Dick. I have an idea.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.582
It's going great.
Thanks for asking.

13:13.918 --> 13:18.005
Do you remember
when Gar mentioned
teleportation earlier?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.673
Well, that is the idea.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.884
I remember when he said
it hadn't been invented yet.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.969
Yeah, well, if you'd bothered
to ask me, I would've told you

13:24.053 --> 13:28.015
that it has, by magicians,
over 10,000 years ago.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.433
They should have told somebody.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.019
Yeah, I didn't say
they'd perfected it.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.938
How am I gonna
explain this to you?

13:34.021 --> 13:36.315
Does anyone know
how to turn this on
and make it do things?

13:36.398 --> 13:39.610
No, wait, fuck it. I...
I'm gonna do this
the old-fashioned way.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.947
Okay.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.618
[exhales]

13:47.701 --> 13:48.702
Okay.

13:50.329 --> 13:55.918
So, the old magicians got
the first part nailed.

13:56.001 --> 14:01.006
There has always been a spell
to get someone to disorganize.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.050
-"Disorganize"?
-Yeah. You know,

14:03.133 --> 14:06.262
go all to bits.
That was the easy part.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.639
The hard part was
putting them
back together again.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.099
And that's where
things went wrong.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.600
You'd always end up
with some poor bloke

14:11.684 --> 14:14.436
with a... a foot sticking
out of his mouth,

14:14.520 --> 14:17.606
or just a big mass of
quivering jelly with
one blinking eye.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.276
Uh, this is beginning to
sound not very promising.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.195
Yeah. The other problem
was that no one
could ever predict

14:23.279 --> 14:26.782
exactly where a person
would be when
they re-organized.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.118
Back then they didn't know
that the earth moved
through space,

14:29.201 --> 14:33.455
so someone could re-appear
a mile high in the sky,

14:33.539 --> 14:37.876
or right at the bottom
of the ocean.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.046
If only there was a computer
that could predict
in time and space

14:41.130 --> 14:43.632
exactly where a disorganized
person would reorganize.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.468
And had the ability to
control the reorganization.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.345
Right down to
the very last atom.

14:49.555 --> 14:53.892
Oh, wait. We do.
You're welcome.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.148
Where is Espenson?

15:00.482 --> 15:03.652
You're fighting your instincts.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.072
But your instincts
have always guided you
to your destiny.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.827
Even when the world
stood in your way.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.178
[Mr. Ross]
So, in this line of code,
X equals X plus one.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.014
You can see we have a variable,
then an equal sign,

15:32.097 --> 15:35.434
then that same variable again,
then some math operator.

15:35.517 --> 15:38.479
In this case, it happens
to be a plus sign.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.982
-Then a one and...
-I see a shortcut.

15:45.444 --> 15:49.365
Instead of writing
"X equals X plus one,"

15:49.448 --> 15:52.409
um, you could just write
"X plus equals one"

15:52.493 --> 15:54.912
and it performs
the same function.

15:58.999 --> 16:03.003
Ding-ding, Mr. Sanger.
Looks like you are headed
to the bonus round,

16:03.087 --> 16:05.464
where the scores
can really change.
[chuckles]

16:08.926 --> 16:09.885
[female student] Lame.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.805
[bell ringing]

16:18.268 --> 16:20.562
Hey, Sebastian,
hang back a sec.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.241
So... you're a smart kid.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.867
Now, here's the thing,

16:33.951 --> 16:37.871
teaching is about fundamentals,
not shortcuts.

16:37.955 --> 16:42.000
And I'm worried that
you haven't mastered
the fundamentals.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.755
Take this to
the guidance office.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.591
Have Mr. Perez find you a spot
in Basic Programming.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.848
I was... I was trying to help.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.016
I think you need to work
on your maturity level.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.652
That's all. You can go.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.615
[Mother Mayhem]
He punished you for
being smarter than him.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.868
That's what happens
when common people
are given power

17:15.951 --> 17:18.579
over those who are
extraordinary.

17:18.662 --> 17:21.999
Mother, there is something
you need to see.

17:24.918 --> 17:29.089
-[sighs]
This can't be happening.
-But it is...

17:29.173 --> 17:32.259
[screaming]

17:32.342 --> 17:34.803
The pain of his transition
is growing.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.430
Mother, make him
enter the Well.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.848
Make him drink from it now.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.309
No. I won't force him.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.938
[Sebastian whimpering]

17:45.022 --> 17:46.732
So the trick is
re-organizing matter

17:46.815 --> 17:48.984
back into its original
coherent shape.

17:49.067 --> 17:52.154
Theoretically,
it's what Beast Boy does
every time he transforms.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.199
Can it be done
for someone who's DNA
isn't already encoded?

17:55.282 --> 17:57.117
How long do I have
to figure it out?

17:57.201 --> 17:58.202
No time at all.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.580
Hard maybe.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.422
[Jinx] Right, it's nearly time.
You ready to power up?

18:10.506 --> 18:14.301
What makes you think
you can get me
my powers back, again?

18:14.384 --> 18:16.887
Okay. Well, I never said
I could get you
your powers back.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.473
I said I had a spell
to help you find them.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.185
[clears throat]

18:23.268 --> 18:25.187
You can still feel them,
can't you?

18:25.270 --> 18:29.358
Like a phantom limb?
Or when someone you love dies.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.777
They might be gone,
but the connection
is always there.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.949
-Yeah. That's how it feels.
-Mmm-hmm.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.493
The thing is though, Rachel,

18:39.576 --> 18:42.329
magic is about
intention, right?

18:42.412 --> 18:44.456
So, your powers
couldn't have been
taken from you,

18:44.540 --> 18:47.376
unless a part of you
wanted to lose them.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.002
You think I wanted this
to happen?

18:49.086 --> 18:50.504
Well, you tell me.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.005
You've done a lot
of amazing things
in your life,

18:52.089 --> 18:53.465
but you've never
just been normal.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.844
Being normal...

18:58.470 --> 18:59.930
Yeah, that felt pretty good.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.268
Do you even want
your powers back?

19:04.351 --> 19:08.021
'Cause if you don't,
that is okay. I'll never tell.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.071
Maybe being normal
is a little overrated.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.699
[chuckles] Yes,
I could not agree more.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.785
So, Raven...

19:23.036 --> 19:24.121
let's get started.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.373
What are you doing?

19:28.333 --> 19:30.168
Right. Eat that.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.546
-What?
-Yeah.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.881
That's a part of the spell.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.134
A very important,
albeit disgusting part.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.260
So, start eating.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.469
Okay.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.388
-Why does it smell like--
-Pineapple-mango?

19:41.471 --> 19:43.348
Yeah, that's my conditioner.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.933
You know, that doesn't help.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.270
Really?
Pineapple-mango is nice.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.982
-[gulping]
-That's it. Quickly,
like ripping off a band-aid.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.526
Well done.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.236
[scoffs]

19:57.321 --> 19:58.614
[cell phone ringing]

20:02.409 --> 20:04.077
Bernard. What's up?

20:04.161 --> 20:06.496
[Bernard] You'd better
get over here.

20:06.580 --> 20:10.959
[Conner] Flatten
the eccentricity of all
northern satellites to .078.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.922
Increase inclination by 39.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.174
Yes, sir.

20:17.257 --> 20:23.013
You, maximize Delta-V
between longitudes,
a 165.4 degrees East,

20:23.096 --> 20:26.516
-14.7 degrees West. Quickly.
-Okay.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.602
-This is insane.
-[Gar] Compared to what?

20:28.685 --> 20:31.730
Two hours ago
I was inside a stomach
trying to kill a ghost snake.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.399
And two hours before that,
we were fighting zombies.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.651
And I kissed Bernard.

20:38.236 --> 20:39.529
Big night for everyone.

20:40.989 --> 20:43.992
-We don't have all night.
-Whoa!

20:44.076 --> 20:45.661
[keyboard clacking]

20:45.744 --> 20:47.996
And in her grace and wisdom...

20:50.958 --> 20:52.000
Yo.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.717
[computer beeping]

21:01.718 --> 21:03.512
Luna granted us the Moon.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.471
[computers beeping]

21:05.180 --> 21:06.848
[Rachel laughing]

21:06.932 --> 21:08.308
[man on radio]
All satellites orientation
complete.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.810
[all cheering]

21:17.734 --> 21:18.819
Yes.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.035
Well, he pulled it off.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.663
[sighs]

21:34.167 --> 21:35.544
We have just over an hour.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.005
If the Blood Moon does not
return to us, we are--

21:38.088 --> 21:39.423
It will.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.466
There's no natural way
this can be happening.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.555
Hack into the LexCorp server.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.640
I think I know
who's behind this.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.069
Tonight's been pretty crazy.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.571
I know.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.699
I kept imagining
Kal-El flying in
and seeing bald Conner

22:05.782 --> 22:07.367
ordering everyone around.

22:08.785 --> 22:12.664
Yeah, but,
I was thinking more about us.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.835
Oh.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.422
Speaking of that, um...

22:21.465 --> 22:23.091
If we find this temple...

22:24.718 --> 22:26.053
Are you going?

22:27.888 --> 22:29.806
Sounds like
we might not have to.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.683
[exhales]

22:31.767 --> 22:32.768
Thank God.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.102
-[Bernard chuckles]
-What?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.146
Uh, because it sounded
very dangerous,

22:36.229 --> 22:38.356
and all you have
is that tiny Bo staff that
you barely know how to use.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.234
Um, why don't you
ask that snake
if I know how to use it?

22:41.318 --> 22:43.070
-Oh, well, maybe I will.
-Oh.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.448
Oh, but I can't. Can I?
'Cause you killed it,
didn't you?

22:47.491 --> 22:48.658
My hero.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.411
[Bernard chuckles]

22:53.205 --> 22:56.833
You know, sooner or later,

22:56.917 --> 22:59.252
I am gonna have to go
fight with them.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.838
As long as it's later.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.808
[tense music playing]

23:21.108 --> 23:22.484
[Kory] You okay?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.154
You don't look so good.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.157
Yeah, I don't feel so good.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.159
Why don't you go lie down.
Go get some rest.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.663
It's okay. I just gonna
get some fresh air.
No, I'm okay. I'll--

23:34.746 --> 23:36.164
Hey, do you want some company?

23:43.421 --> 23:45.590
It's okay. It's been
happening to me all day.

23:58.186 --> 24:02.190
You seem restless.
Are you all right, my friend?

24:02.274 --> 24:04.401
I'm not really in the mood
for conversation right now.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.112
Yet so many wish
to speak with you.

24:07.195 --> 24:10.490
If you want an autograph,
I can sign a napkin
or something.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.660
Listen...

24:14.953 --> 24:16.413
[lions roaring distantly]

24:19.291 --> 24:21.751
You see? They speak.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.883
Do I know you?

24:27.966 --> 24:31.303
The animals, they also see.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.182
You will see,

24:35.265 --> 24:40.395
like Buddy Baker
and Mari McCabe,
but you must look.

24:40.478 --> 24:44.566
Well, it was nice
speaking with you,
but I gotta go.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.109
-Wait!
-[lion growling distantly]

24:47.777 --> 24:51.281
When the tower splits in half,
go to The Red.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.617
What?

24:53.700 --> 24:55.911
When the tower splits in half,
when you see it happen,

24:55.994 --> 24:58.997
take yourself to The Red.
Do you understand?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.750
Do not forget this.

25:01.833 --> 25:05.587
In the end, all of life,
everyone and everything,

25:06.796 --> 25:10.842
it depends on you...
Garfield Logan.

25:20.894 --> 25:21.895
Hey!

25:26.191 --> 25:27.567
Uh, sorry.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.123
Good work. That was impressive.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.336
I know.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.088
You bought us some time.

25:48.171 --> 25:52.425
-Pretty sure I saved
your ass, but... sure.
-[Dick scoffs]

25:52.509 --> 25:56.763
You moved some satellites.
You didn't stop the earth
from turning.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.890
When they drift
out of position,

25:58.974 --> 26:01.101
they'll have a five-minute
window to do the ritual
just before the moon sets.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.519
But you knew that, right?

26:04.312 --> 26:08.108
If they figure it out,
which they probably won't.

26:08.191 --> 26:11.111
Right now, they're panicking,
and panic clouds
rational thought.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.488
I gotta be honest, Conner.
I'm starting to get a little
concerned about you.

26:13.571 --> 26:15.740
Why? 'Cause
I'm winning so hard?

26:15.824 --> 26:18.285
[Dick] Leather jacket,
the bald head, I get it,
you're changing,

26:18.368 --> 26:20.203
you're growing,
that's all good.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.664
Just trust me,
you don't want it
to happen too fast.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.834
Mmm, too fast.

26:25.917 --> 26:30.130
Well, you know what,
I'd say it's happening
just in fucking time.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.549
Rachel's useless.

26:32.632 --> 26:36.845
Gar's losing his mind,
Kory's blue-thing,
inconsistent at best.

26:36.928 --> 26:40.640
And, Tim, well,
he can't do anything... at all.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.601
So, if I were you,

26:43.685 --> 26:45.937
I'd stop worrying about
my best player

26:46.021 --> 26:47.647
and just take the win.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.400
You're not the only one
to ever have to
go through this.

26:50.483 --> 26:53.695
Me, Kory, Rachel, Gar,
we've been there.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.072
We've all had to fight
a battle with our dark side.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.702
This isn't my dark side.

27:02.787 --> 27:05.248
This is the side
that's looking out for me.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.208
Maybe that's why
you don't like it.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.381
If we're done here,

27:13.465 --> 27:15.800
we'll be in the lab
setting up a way
to bring Sebastian back.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.096
We could use your help.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.814
You.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.067
Have the LexCorp servers
had any hack attempts
in the last ten minutes?

27:33.234 --> 27:35.403
Four minutes ago.
Mainframe breach.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.905
Satnav was accessed and viewed.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.574
-Point of origin?
-Huh?

27:39.657 --> 27:42.285
Where did it come from?

27:42.369 --> 27:47.290
Um... North Metro Quadrant.
Just off State Road 19
near Hynek Lake.

27:47.374 --> 27:48.708
The Fire Creek Dam.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.002
That's where she is.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.341
Thank you.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.388
[Sebastian shivering]

28:05.392 --> 28:08.728
Go ahead. This will
ease your pain.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.021
At least for now.

28:16.694 --> 28:17.946
We don't have much time.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.115
When the moment comes,
you must be ready.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.202
-Please--
-No.

28:24.285 --> 28:25.703
I need your full attention now.

28:28.706 --> 28:31.042
You still have
a final lesson to learn.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.777
What's this?

28:59.529 --> 29:00.780
I knew you'd forget.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.620
Oh, no.

29:07.704 --> 29:11.583
It was six months ago, tonight,
that I came into your store.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.835
-Oh, my God.
-And you were standing there

29:13.918 --> 29:16.754
with your... your apron
and your little turtle--

29:16.838 --> 29:20.425
Tortoise, actually,
and it was quite big, so...

29:20.508 --> 29:23.011
Yes, tortoise. Whatever.

29:23.094 --> 29:26.014
And, uh, you looked up at me...

29:26.097 --> 29:27.849
[imitates Sebastian]
"Hello, then. Can I help you?"

29:27.932 --> 29:31.686
Is that supposed to be me?
But I don't sound
like that, do I?

29:31.769 --> 29:34.647
-You sound exactly like that.
-Oh, my God.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.941
[Julie] And I remember
thinking, um...

29:39.110 --> 29:41.279
"That's the loneliest man
I've ever seen.

29:43.239 --> 29:45.533
Why is he so lonely? [chuckles]

29:45.617 --> 29:47.619
I've gotta do something
about that."

29:49.120 --> 29:51.498
And I've seen you
every single day since then.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.213
Are you gonna open it?
[chuckles]

30:13.811 --> 30:16.981
You always talked about
how the one your mother
gave you

30:17.065 --> 30:19.108
was the start
of everything, so...

30:20.527 --> 30:24.489
And now with you
designing your own game,

30:24.572 --> 30:27.575
I thought maybe it
would be... inspirational.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.624
We need to talk.

30:36.793 --> 30:41.256
Uh... okay. [chuckles]

30:41.339 --> 30:43.883
Well, I... I think you...
you know what I'm going to say.

30:46.344 --> 30:49.264
I really don't.
[chuckles nervously]

30:53.893 --> 30:55.061
It's over.

30:57.855 --> 30:59.190
You're joking, right?

31:00.692 --> 31:03.361
-What's... what's wrong?
-This.

31:03.444 --> 31:07.740
All of this, this...
None of it makes any sense.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.659
I mean, what...
what am I supposed to do?

31:09.742 --> 31:13.246
Just sit here and wait
for you to figure it out?

31:14.872 --> 31:16.374
What are you talking about?

31:16.457 --> 31:18.293
Don't, don't, don't,
don't do that.

31:18.376 --> 31:22.422
Don't act all surprised,
or... or upset, or...

31:23.339 --> 31:24.841
Look, um,

31:24.924 --> 31:29.679
I'm... I'm trying to make this
easier on both of us.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.306
Are you breaking up with me?

31:32.473 --> 31:33.516
Yes.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.607
Look, um... Okay.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.984
-I don't know what's hap--
-I can't do this anymore!

31:43.067 --> 31:45.028
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.988
I'm sorry.

31:47.572 --> 31:48.698
I'm sorry.

31:50.700 --> 31:54.162
I-- Look, I... I know
how this goes.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.664
Things seem great, and then,

31:56.748 --> 32:00.460
someone else comes along.
And that's it.

32:00.543 --> 32:05.298
-What? That isn't true.
-Yes. Yes, yes, it is.

32:05.381 --> 32:10.345
See, I'm not
the destination, Julie.
I never am.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.180
I'm just a step along the way.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.724
You're wrong.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.854
You can lie to yourself...

32:22.440 --> 32:23.733
but don't lie to me.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.368
[chuckles nervously]
Look, I'm... I'm gonna go.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.705
Uh...

32:37.789 --> 32:40.041
I think we have more
to talk about,
so I'm gonna call you--

32:40.124 --> 32:41.042
Don't.

33:02.605 --> 33:04.107
Why did you do it?

33:04.190 --> 33:07.485
Because I knew she would,
eventually...

33:09.195 --> 33:11.739
When other people hurt you,
that's a tragedy.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.201
But if you take up the cudgel
and do it for them,
that's a sin.

33:18.413 --> 33:22.333
Every single one
of your followers
knows your greatness.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.751
They will never leave you.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.422
If you don't know that,
you're lost.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.841
[all] We pledge
our eternal devotion.

33:30.925 --> 33:32.301
Show him your devotion.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.607
We pledge our eternal devotion.

33:52.196 --> 33:56.617
They see you.
They know what you are.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.203
Do you?

34:03.541 --> 34:06.627
Yes. I do.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.724
So, do I have enough juice?

34:19.807 --> 34:22.810
Did you do something
to increase your strength?

34:24.020 --> 34:25.980
I'm not sure. Why?

34:26.063 --> 34:29.650
When I saw you last week,
you only had access to 8.1%

34:29.734 --> 34:32.320
of your total estimated
kinetic output.

34:32.403 --> 34:34.697
You now have access
to over 80%.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.160
And what does that mean?

34:39.243 --> 34:42.121
It means, you need
to be careful.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.540
This isn't just a weapon
anymore, Kory.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.210
If you go all out,
it'll consume you.

34:48.169 --> 34:49.337
It'll kill you.

34:51.255 --> 34:55.343
[Dick] All right. We need
to be clear on exactly
how this is gonna work.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.303
Let's run it one more time.
Rachel?

34:57.386 --> 34:58.930
I'll reach out, search
for my powers and then,

34:59.013 --> 35:00.598
from there, I should be able
to zone-in on Sebastian.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.391
Okay, once that starts... Kory?

35:02.475 --> 35:05.186
I join hands with Rachel
and begin feeding her
my blue light.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.438
And once the connection
is secure... Jinx?

35:07.522 --> 35:09.190
I join hands with
Rachel and Kory,

35:09.273 --> 35:10.983
and once Sebastian is
thoroughly disorganized,

35:11.067 --> 35:12.860
the three of us
draw him back here.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.737
And as long as all
his physical matter ends up

35:14.821 --> 35:17.532
somewhere in this room,
I'll reassemble him.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.784
All right. Once we start,
we've got one shot at this.

35:20.993 --> 35:23.412
It has to work. Okay.

35:24.789 --> 35:25.915
Hey.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.710
Just wanted to say thank you.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.798
For what? [chuckles]
I haven't done anything yet.

35:33.881 --> 35:36.759
Either way,
I'd say you've earned
your five million dollars.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.219
Don't make me regret it.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.429
You really think
this was about the money?

35:40.513 --> 35:41.514
Wasn't it?

35:43.474 --> 35:47.562
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

35:47.645 --> 35:52.942
But, I have to admit,
hanging out with you
these past few days,

35:53.025 --> 35:55.236
it's been a lot more fun
than I expected.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.701
You call this fun?

36:03.911 --> 36:05.413
Sick, isn't it?

36:05.496 --> 36:07.164
[Jinx chuckles]

36:07.248 --> 36:08.416
What have I become?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.045
Let's go get Sebastian.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.179
[banging on door]

36:22.263 --> 36:23.681
[door smashes open]

36:27.018 --> 36:28.477
[wind whistling]

36:30.521 --> 36:31.731
[gasps]

36:33.399 --> 36:34.400
Do it.

36:38.487 --> 36:39.697
With pleasure.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.869
[yelling]

36:51.417 --> 36:52.710
-So...
-[gasps]

36:54.003 --> 36:55.046
How did that feel?

37:00.051 --> 37:02.803
You have pleased me
by coming here

37:02.887 --> 37:06.682
and showing me your capacity
for blind rage.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.894
An instinct you have ignored
for too long.

37:13.522 --> 37:16.150
-You killed my father.
-[scoffs]

37:17.109 --> 37:21.155
He was so easy to kill.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.115
I sent the same serpent for you
to do my bidding,

37:23.199 --> 37:25.826
but you are so much
stronger than him.

37:28.412 --> 37:30.206
But you're not
stronger than me.

37:37.546 --> 37:40.466
Okay, Rachel,
focus on the light.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.554
Now,

37:45.638 --> 37:52.478
picture your power growing
like leaf-shoots bursting
from a tiny seed

37:52.561 --> 37:56.524
and spreading out,
searching for air,

37:57.400 --> 37:59.694
searching for sunlight.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.529
Searching for you.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.127
[gasps]

38:38.232 --> 38:39.525
Now, Kory.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.373
[gasps]

38:59.754 --> 39:00.713
[exhales]

39:26.864 --> 39:27.823
[gasps]

39:29.200 --> 39:30.910
They've got Conner.

39:30.993 --> 39:33.079
[Tim] Fire Creek Dam.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.955
Forty miles north of here.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.333
Funded by
the Luthor Foundation.

39:37.416 --> 39:40.127
Yep. That's where they are.
Maybe 200 feet underneath.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.629
Then that's where we're going.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.798
I thought we wanted to avoid
a head-on confrontation?

39:43.881 --> 39:45.299
Thanks to Conner,
now we have no choice.

39:45.382 --> 39:46.884
Can't we teleport them
both out?

39:46.967 --> 39:49.887
No! When you try and do two,
their cells intermingle.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.472
It's not pretty.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.640
And do them one
at a time, they'll notice
what's happening

39:52.723 --> 39:54.016
and make sure it doesn't.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.518
All right. Find Gar.
We leave in five minutes.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.027
Dick, wait!

40:10.407 --> 40:12.993
This prophecy, it's, um...

40:13.077 --> 40:15.496
I don't know. I have a really
bad feeling about tonight.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.832
If you're asking
if I believe in that?
No, I don't.

40:17.915 --> 40:20.501
Well, it's hard to dismiss,
isn't it?

40:20.584 --> 40:22.086
Everything else
is coming true--

40:22.169 --> 40:25.172
To hell with prophecies
and destinies, and visions.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.632
Kory, you said it yourself,

40:26.715 --> 40:27.967
you've had more visions
than anyone,

40:28.050 --> 40:29.135
and none of them
have come true.

40:31.345 --> 40:32.513
There's one more.

40:34.473 --> 40:35.933
You and me...

40:37.393 --> 40:39.603
and a little girl
holding a red balloon.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.025
I had it, too.

40:47.444 --> 40:48.737
Why didn't you tell me?

40:56.245 --> 40:57.496
I don't know.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.541
It's okay.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.044
It's like you said.
To hell with visions.

41:14.513 --> 41:17.474
[Nightwing] This is a map
to the temple based on
what Rachel saw.

41:17.558 --> 41:20.144
Gar, you're first.
Break in and find
Rachel's powers.

41:20.227 --> 41:22.396
We need her
back up to full speed
as soon as possible.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.940
Be destructive. Something big.

41:25.024 --> 41:26.650
I got it covered.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.694
All I need from you is
to keep her distracted,

41:28.777 --> 41:31.447
while, Tim, and Rachel
find Conner and Sebastian
and get out of there.

41:31.530 --> 41:32.907
That leaves the rest up to you.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.617
I'm gonna have to
get real close.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.243
You can kill her?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.537
Yeah, I could fucking kill her.
I'll take her out. Nut her!

41:41.665 --> 41:44.210
I mean, I will freeze her

41:44.293 --> 41:46.754
long enough for us
to get the fuck out
of there, presumably.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.423
Let's be clear on one thing.
This is not personal.

41:49.506 --> 41:51.509
This is a smash-and-grab.

41:51.592 --> 41:54.136
We get in, we get the boys
and get out. Understood?

41:55.679 --> 41:56.722
[barks]

41:59.308 --> 42:00.267
All right, let's go.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.315
Hey, it's okay, Krypto.
We'll bring him back.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.691
-I promise.
-[Krypto whines]

42:11.278 --> 42:12.363

42:20.579 --> 42:24.458
Mother... the Blood Moon
is coming back.

42:24.541 --> 42:26.377
We only have five minutes.

42:27.753 --> 42:29.964
The time for transformation
is finally here.

42:32.174 --> 42:34.134
Drink from the blood.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.303
Then bathe in the pool.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.806
Only then, your transformation
will be complete.

42:41.809 --> 42:46.981

I have to admit,
as welcomes go...

44:28.082 --> 44:30.167
This is a little
on the chilly side.

44:32.628 --> 44:36.423
What's that, love?
Can't hear you.

44:40.135 --> 44:41.053
[groans]

44:45.724 --> 44:46.850
Jinx!

44:53.774 --> 44:55.943
Fuck! Not again.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.129
I got this.

come on, please,
it's not too late.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.489
Please, Sebastian!

45:43.991 --> 45:47.786
I'm sorry, Rachel. I'm staying.

45:47.870 --> 45:50.956
Sebastian,
you don't have to do this.

45:52.750 --> 45:53.834
Yes, I do.

45:55.919 --> 46:01.008
I'm just so tired
of being nothing.

No!
