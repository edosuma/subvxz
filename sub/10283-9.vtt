WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:06.740
Previously on E.R.:

00:06.740 --> 00:08.576
Oh, man.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.744
I've been here for a long time.
I know the people.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.681
I know the department.
I just want to put my
name into the mixture.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.716
You want me to take
this, Kerry? I don't mind.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.185
What, you think
I'm rusty?

00:19.487 --> 00:22.056
You've been the one person
I can count on.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.426
That means a lot to me--
that friendship.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.129
What you're saying is that we'll
just stay friends.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.630
I told you I have
a boyfriend.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.465
Oh. So what is he,
a lawyer,

00:31.465 --> 00:33.167
a commodities trader,
a dentist?

00:33.167 --> 00:34.202
He's a doctor.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.236
County?

00:35.236 --> 00:36.237
In the army.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.172
When's he coming home?

00:46.547 --> 00:49.317
( chuckling )

00:49.317 --> 00:51.452
That's got to be the wankiest
idea I've ever heard.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.653
You must be shell-shocked.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.455
What are you... wankiest?

00:54.455 --> 00:58.459
Uh, foolish, ridiculous,
possibly even stupid.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.361
I think that is
the best idea

01:00.361 --> 01:01.662
I have ever had.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.364
I don't know what
the problem is.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.132
Okay, it's sweet, yeah.
"Best"? I don't think so.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.401
And it's ten after 7:00.
I have to go to work.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.471
GALLANT:
Just give me one good
reason why we shouldn't.

01:10.471 --> 01:13.307
Because it's 100 degrees in here
and I'm about to die.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.742
You're trying
to change the subject.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.210
I can't breathe.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.611
Listen, you can
be honest with me.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.712
No, I am being
honest with you.

01:18.712 --> 01:19.747
I can't breathe.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.715
Michael!

01:21.715 --> 01:23.251
GALLANT:
I'm not budging until
you give me

01:23.251 --> 01:24.452
one good reason
why we shouldn't.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.819
Because you've gone
completely mad.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.188
Oh, come on,
no muss, no fuss.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.822
No family.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.424
Okay, okay, they might
be a little surprised.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.659
Oh, you think?

01:31.659 --> 01:33.627
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.
Guess what I did today.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.463
They'd get over it.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.331
No, actually,
I don't think mine would.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.168
They'll have to,
'cause I love you.
Michael.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.236
Listen, it'll be
a great story to tell
our grandchildren.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.437
They'll think
we were crazy.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.472
We would be crazy.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.839
Do you love me?

01:45.839 --> 01:47.475
Yes, I do.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.777
See? You already
said "I do."

01:49.777 --> 01:51.179
That settles it.
That settles it.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.180
We're getting
hitched today.

01:52.180 --> 01:55.183
Wait, wait, not so fast.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.453
Will I have a bouquet?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.627
Michael...

02:06.627 --> 02:08.496
Michael...

03:00.614 --> 03:02.250
( snoring )

03:02.250 --> 03:04.985
Uh, little head lac,
CT negative.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.920
Just move her
to an exam room,

03:06.920 --> 03:08.256
let her sleep it off

03:08.256 --> 03:09.690
and then,
a la casa.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.725
Okay, let me know
when she's set up.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.427
Sure. Right this way,
Glenda.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.728
What's with
the stop sign?

03:14.728 --> 03:15.996
Oh, it's a school
crossing guard.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.865
Doesn't that just
make you sick?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.967
The idea that that woman's
getting drunk on the job?

03:19.967 --> 03:22.936
Small, innocent, helpless,
possibly even frail children

03:22.936 --> 03:24.638
in her charge.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.739
Whoa, whoa.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.276
What's happening
in there?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.782
Hey, Frank,
que pasa?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.517
PRATT:
I think they're
talking about you.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.387
What?
Weaver's kicking
their butts is my guess.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.854
She's going to kick
their butts right out of here

03:40.854 --> 03:42.556
if they don't stop
yapping at each other.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.392
Isn't one of them going
to be the new ER chief?

03:44.392 --> 03:45.626
My money ain't on
the nosebleed.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.295
The nosebleed?

03:47.295 --> 03:49.029
You miss just about
everything, don't you?

03:49.029 --> 03:51.299
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where the heck do you
think you're going?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.600
Uh, a guy
in Curtain One

03:52.600 --> 03:53.734
wants me to grab
him some doughnuts.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.369
Give me that.
What are you thinking?

03:55.369 --> 03:56.604
He was going
to give me a tip.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.039
Urine sample,
Exam 3, to the lab.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.342
I need you to run up
to the surgical floor,

04:01.342 --> 04:02.910
pick up the level one
rapid infuser.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.012
Surgical floor?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.680
That's good.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.016
All right, let's clear
some of these patients.

04:09.016 --> 04:09.983
I will be on today,

04:09.983 --> 04:11.419
but first run your cases

04:11.419 --> 04:12.986
by either Drs. Kovac
or Clemente.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.988
You're on today?

04:14.988 --> 04:15.923
Good.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.591
I mean, that's good.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.959
You're stuck up
in administration
all the time.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.661
It's good to keep
your skills honed.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.962
Dr. Kovac

04:21.962 --> 04:23.931
and Dr. Clemente will
share the honor

04:23.931 --> 04:25.433
of running the board today.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.700
Share?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.068
Abby, head lac's
ready for you.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.670
Doctors.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.938
After you.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.473
No, no, after
you, my man.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.442
KOVAC:
No, no, really.
Really. I insist.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.976
Oh, I insist, too.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.378
KOVAC:
No, no, I mean,
I'm serious.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.479
I'm serious too...

04:38.479 --> 04:39.513
Dr. Clemente!

04:39.513 --> 04:42.816
The board.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.518
Right.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.487
Okay, Linda, come on,
come on, come on, stop it.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.622
Don't make nobody...

04:48.622 --> 04:50.424
Haleh, your
paranoid gardener

04:50.424 --> 04:52.025
needs another
slug of Haldol.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.094
That's all right,
I got this. Go ahead.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.530
I'll be back.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.098
Okay, Glenda...

04:58.098 --> 05:00.401
Here we go,
a little stick, okay?

05:00.401 --> 05:01.569
( yells )

05:01.569 --> 05:02.803
Crap.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.738
Ortho's here
for your tib-fib.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.807
Oh, crap, crap,
crap...

05:06.807 --> 05:08.576
Nice.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.511
Yeah. Morris signed her out
as a garden-variety drunk,

05:10.511 --> 05:12.580
but her IV's bleeding
like stink

05:12.580 --> 05:14.014
and her lac's oozing
around the sutures.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.716
Alcoholics
are often

05:15.716 --> 05:17.485
a little
coagulopathic.
Stuck you...

05:17.485 --> 05:19.620
How was your little sit-down
with Weaver this morning?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.822
No, crossing...
She was telling me
and Dr. Clemente...

05:21.822 --> 05:23.023
I told you
you little punks...
...how charming we are.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.525
Really?
Don't sit
in my chair...

05:24.525 --> 05:25.759
You don't think
I'm charming?

05:25.759 --> 05:26.927
I think you're
extremely charming.

05:26.927 --> 05:27.928
I just also think...

05:27.928 --> 05:30.097
( yells )

05:30.097 --> 05:32.733
Oh, crap,
spilled my coffee.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.068
Uh, she was...
she was telling us

05:35.068 --> 05:37.405
that we have
to get along better.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.541
You know, leave
a better impression

05:40.541 --> 05:42.410
Fat little children...
to the residents,

05:42.410 --> 05:43.977
and be more agreeable.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.846
Well, that's
a lot to ask.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.515
No drinking.
You don't think
I'm agreeable?

05:47.515 --> 05:48.816
I think you're
agreeable, yes...

05:48.816 --> 05:50.818
No, you still think
I'm full of...

05:50.818 --> 05:52.453
Oh!

05:52.453 --> 05:54.588
Active duty servicemen
can get married the same day.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.889
Bingo.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.425
Ah, well, that's
where you're headed.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.427
I mean, I realize
it's all sex now,

05:59.427 --> 06:00.828
but 20 years
down the road

06:00.828 --> 06:02.630
she's dragging you off
to the Moose Lodge

06:02.630 --> 06:05.633
for folk dancing
and bingo.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.101
You know, I'm damn
envious of you, Gallant.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.438
Finding your soul mate.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.072
Someone to share
your hopes

06:12.072 --> 06:13.907
and calm your fears.
Uh-huh.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.609
You know, hold your hand
in the dark night.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.677
That's a good
one, man.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.711
Keep saying it
to yourself--

06:17.711 --> 06:19.012
you might
believe it.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.114
Dr. Gallant, I'd like
to offer my services

06:21.114 --> 06:22.816
in officiating
at your nuptials.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.051
What?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.085
I'm a Universal
Life Minister.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.987
I can marry
you and Neela.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.556
Jerr, I think
they're looking
for something legal.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.023
It's completely legal.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.459
I've married
lots of people.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.462
So, what are you, like,
Reverend Jerry?

06:34.462 --> 06:36.664
Actually, I go by
Father Superior.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.034
LOCKHART:
So the rumors are true?

06:41.034 --> 06:43.170
Yes, and I'd like you
to be my bridesmaid...

06:43.170 --> 06:45.172
maid of honor,
whatever.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.208
Well, normally
I'd say no,

06:48.208 --> 06:51.479
because of the taffeta dress
and matching peau de soie shoes.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.846
But this time it's because

06:52.846 --> 06:53.947
you've had a complete
brain lapse.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.516
Michael and I love each other.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.650
We want to be together.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.018
But today?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.020
We thought it'd be
kind of crazy, you know?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.955
Something good
we could tell...

07:01.955 --> 07:03.657
Anyway, his tour
is over.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.126
Well, what if he gets
stationed in, like, Romania?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.661
He's hoping to finish

07:07.661 --> 07:08.896
his training in stateside
army hospital.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.664
I'm not saying

07:10.664 --> 07:12.566
he's not a great guy-- he is,
but do you know him?

07:12.566 --> 07:13.867
Of course I do.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.503
He's incredibly kind,
generous...

07:15.503 --> 07:17.170
My dry cleaning guy
is kind and generous.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.506
Where's the prednisone?

07:18.506 --> 07:20.641
Left bottom shelf.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.511
I know him. I do.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.146
Does he fold the newspaper
inside out when he reads it

07:26.146 --> 07:28.215
and then forget to put it
back when he's done?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.250
Does he clip
his toenails in bed?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.252
Does he drip
when the toilet seat's down?
Abby...

07:32.252 --> 07:34.254
Does he like jam
on his grilled
cheese sandwiches?

07:34.254 --> 07:36.557
All these things I can
learn during the marriage.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.892
Well, yes, but I don't
think that's the best...
I love Michael.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.629
And I could use
a little support here.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.066
I'm very happy for you,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.601
I really am.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.669
And of course I would
stand up for you.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.037
I wouldn't miss it.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.205
Great.
Okay.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.546
Dr. Pratt, you got a moment?

07:58.546 --> 07:59.246
Sure.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.881
Walk with me?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.049
All right.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.817
This young man,
KJ Thibeaux,

08:03.817 --> 08:05.586
you've been sponsoring him
as a volunteen?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.120
Yeah.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.722
Apparently he got into
the surgical floor storeroom--

08:08.722 --> 08:09.957
stole a digital
video camera.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.692
What?
Get out of here.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.126
Yeah. I don't want to make
a big issue about it,

08:13.126 --> 08:14.962
but as long as he's
willing to admit it,

08:14.962 --> 08:16.296
give the camera back,

08:16.296 --> 08:17.798
it doesn't go any further
than this.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.166
Wait. Who told you it was KJ?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.668
Chief of security called me.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.902
One of his guards
reported it.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.604
And he's sure about this?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.005
Surveillance cameras.
Everything's on tape.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.307
I'm sorry.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.242
All right, I'll talk to him.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.778
He's just a teenager.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.846
I'll talk to him.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.115
Jack Gitts, 38, high speed MVC,
no medical history.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.618
Hey, so I've been checking.
Restrained, complains
of abdominal pain

08:37.618 --> 08:40.253
we can get the license, but they
close for an hour at 1:00.
I can't talk right now.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.889
I know, but just quickly, I got
a lead on three possible places.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.691
Probable femur fracture.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.225
And the florist in the hospital
would love to do a wedding.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.694
Michael, I have
a patient here.

08:46.694 --> 08:47.861
Vitals?
Tachy to 130,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.329
shallow resps,
BP 80 palp.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.098
Oh, and Jerry's going
to marry us.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.166
What?!
I'll come back
when you're not so busy.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.669
Page Dubenko and call
for O-neg...

08:55.669 --> 08:56.670
Did he say Jerry?

08:56.670 --> 08:57.705
I thought you knew.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.607
One, two, three.

08:59.607 --> 09:02.242
Cantaloupe allergy's
waiting for the Benadryl
to kick in.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.311
Infected nose piercing
is home on Keflex.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.113
She did that herself
with a thumbtack.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.615
Ah, sexy.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.982
Is she single?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.685
And platelets are back
on my drunk head lac.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.954
A little low-- 98,
and the INR is 1.4.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.322
Yeah, borderline.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.024
Still, I'd like to give
platelets and FFP.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.992
Yeah, go ahead.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.828
Even a tiny bleed
can become serious

09:20.828 --> 09:22.362
if she can't clot.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.031
Possibly a good
idea, Dr. Kovac,

09:24.031 --> 09:25.733
but you do realize
that blood products

09:25.733 --> 09:27.701
carry the risk of infection

09:27.701 --> 09:29.169
and transfusion reaction,
don't you?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.971
Yeah.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.806
Was the CT negative?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.642
Well, there's not bleed
that we could see.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.044
Do you really want
to expose your patient
to those kind of risks

09:37.044 --> 09:38.779
just because
the platelets are low?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.113
The scan was
four hours ago.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.849
She might have
a delayed bleed.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.884
I'd worry more if she had
mental status changes,

09:43.884 --> 09:46.019
or a focal neuro exam.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.788
He's got a point.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.290
Well, she's drunk, so that's
kind of hard to assess.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.760
Yeah, well, drunk
people get sober.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.361
KOVAC:
And careful observation

09:54.361 --> 09:56.163
is still better
than any lab.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.132
That's right.
I'd have to agree.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.903
What just happened?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.838
They've been pulling
that on me all morning.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.340
I don't know, some sort
of competitive agreeing contest.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.178
I wouldn't steal
any stupid camera.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.180
Did you just hear what I said?

10:13.180 --> 10:14.214
They got you on tape.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.783
It couldn't have been me.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.117
You were up there
long enough.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.019
They had to look
for that infuser thing.

10:19.019 --> 10:22.389
Don't give me that crap, KJ.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.726
Okay, there's this girl--
one of the volunteers.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.127
She's fine as hell.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.896
You know,
I went out on a limb for you.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.130
I thought having you here was
going to teach you something,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.164
keep your ass out of trouble.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.332
Then you go and do this.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.068
I didn't do anything!

10:35.068 --> 10:37.304
You know what? Your father's
on his way here.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.239
So for now, go sit
in the waiting room.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.241
But Dr. Pratt...

10:41.241 --> 10:42.642
Waiting room.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.147
Bag him.
Have you got a second line?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.216
Vein keeps blowing.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.952
Run the first unit
of O-neg and hold four
more units ready to go.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.787
So where's the reception
going to be?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.288
He needs
central access.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.824
They haven't
decided yet.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.358
I'd go
to Baby Joon's.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.994
La Chiquita Roja
is more romantic.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.030
Neela, place
the subclavian.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.766
Cordis and sterile sixes.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.334
What was the other place
Gallant mentioned?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.169
MALIK:
The Mandarin Club.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.170
No way.
Yeah, that's a bad idea.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.471
Turn his head
to the left.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.073
Systolic's 84.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.174
I've always liked
the Mandarin.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.408
Got a flash.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.144
Should definitely do
Chiquita Roja.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.379
Candles, white
tablecloths, you know.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.248
Nah. Baby Joon's,
I'm telling you.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.483
Martinis
and chili fries.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.352
X-rays are up.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.454
C-spine's clear.
Mediastinum looks okay.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.789
Very good.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.990
So where are
you registered?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.859
What?
Definitely have
to register.

11:31.859 --> 11:32.993
Could I have the sonosite,
please?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.194
My ex-wife didn't register

11:34.194 --> 11:35.896
and we ended up
with a bunch of clocks.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.198
With my sister, it was salad
bowls. Seven of them.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.968
Does anybody mind if we just
focus on the patient?

11:43.436 --> 11:46.006
Okay, then.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.308
Can we have that
sonosite, please?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.783
Neela.

11:55.783 --> 11:56.917
So, can you get away?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.819
We need to go get
a license.

11:58.819 --> 11:59.987
We don't even know where
we're getting married yet.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.055
Absolutely we do.
The hospital chapel.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.156
Well, when did we
decide that?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.391
You were busy,
so I thought you...

12:04.391 --> 12:05.959
And Jerry's going
to marry us?

12:05.959 --> 12:08.361
He has some kind of
minister's license, so...

12:08.361 --> 12:10.197
Is that really
who we want?

12:10.197 --> 12:12.265
What's Frank going
to be, the ring bearer?

12:12.265 --> 12:13.333
Listen, we don't have
a lot of time.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.068
I had to make some choices.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.203
You going to choose
the flowers, too?

12:16.203 --> 12:17.905
No, no.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.040
Well, you like lilies,
though, right?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.174
Michael,
we have to talk.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.243
About what?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.445
I just think all this is
maybe getting a little...
Dr. Gallant,

12:25.445 --> 12:27.414
you know the groom isn't really
supposed to see the bride

12:27.414 --> 12:28.982
on the day of the wedding.
Yeah, well,

12:28.982 --> 12:30.450
we have a few details
to work out.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.219
Nothing that can't wait,
I hope.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.254
Dr. Rasgotra's going
to scrub in on this one.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.924
I am?
Yeah. You did that open lap
on the paramedic

12:36.924 --> 12:38.826
in the middle of the street.
I think I can trust you

12:38.826 --> 12:40.861
within the confines
of a sterile operating room.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.096
You're not getting cold feet,
are you?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.431
We'll talk later.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.405
Are his vaccinations
up to date?

12:52.405 --> 12:56.009
His pediatrician and I
don't believe in them.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.279
Immunizations are probably
one of the most successful

12:59.279 --> 13:01.381
public health
interventions
ever developed.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.117
Thank you, but it's
a personal decision.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.252
Did you know the air

13:05.252 --> 13:07.855
has 21% oxygen in it?

13:07.855 --> 13:10.991
He's studying the
atmosphere in school.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.861
Well, that's very cool.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.229
He's setting at 94,
which is low,

13:16.229 --> 13:18.031
but nothing dangerous.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.400
Probably has to do with the
fluid I heard in his lungs.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.935
I'd like to get
a chest X-ray,

13:21.935 --> 13:23.536
which is nothing scary.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.972
It's just a special
kind of photograph

13:24.972 --> 13:26.573
and it doesn't hurt
at all.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.609
My Uncle Deaver had one of those
and we got to see all his bones.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.479
Mm-hmm.
I don't want X-rays
if possible.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.382
Mrs. Kenig, I'm pretty
sure Stewy has pneumonia.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.918
Well, can't you
just treat it then

13:37.918 --> 13:39.552
and we can avoid
the radiation?

13:39.552 --> 13:42.022
It's a small amount
and it just helps us have a look

13:42.022 --> 13:43.390
at what we're dealing with.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.192
Glenda's waking up.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.894
Thank you.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.896
Wouldn't you go with antibiotics
anyway?

13:51.531 --> 13:53.967
Okay.
He needs extra oxygen.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.435
He's going to have
to spend the night.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.204
Okay, that'll be fine.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.239
Then we'll hold off
on the film for now.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.308
But if he gets any worse...

14:01.308 --> 14:02.542
He gets X-rayed.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.981
He says he didn't do it.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.450
D, I don't like this any
better than you do, man.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.185
He wouldn't lie.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.553
Come on, man.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.488
Did he lie about the tagging
he got busted for?

14:15.488 --> 14:18.091
Or the weed they found
in his pocket?

14:18.091 --> 14:20.360
Look, KJ's a good kid.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.529
But right now,
his judgment basically sucks.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.097
I want to talk
to this doctor...

14:24.097 --> 14:25.498
Dubenko.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.334
Yeah, and the
security guard, too.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.003
D, they don't want
to press charges, man.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.171
But they're
accusing my kid.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.339
I just want
to talk to them.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.341
( sighs heavily )

14:34.341 --> 14:38.611
Banana bag is finished and
she took a few ice chips.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.547
Who are you?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.183
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.218
You're at County General.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.220
Let's see if you can sit up
on your own, okay?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.959
She should be
sobering up by now.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.326
Glenda...

14:53.326 --> 14:55.595
will you squeeze
my hand?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.597
Okay, let's see, try
and squeeze my hand.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.532
Squeeze my hand.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.434
Come on.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.602
Okay.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.972
Can you open your eyes?

15:06.273 --> 15:08.308
Glenda, come on.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.310
Good. Okay.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.212
Over here,
right over here.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.981
Now do you know who I am?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.548
Who are you?

15:17.517 --> 15:19.019
Must've cleared,
like, 30 patients

15:19.019 --> 15:20.153
and no one's even
brawling yet.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.588
See, it's not
that hard, is it?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.056
You're right, it's
like the man said.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.724
"Can't we just
all get along?"

15:24.724 --> 15:27.560
Sam, weren't we sending that
cracked broviac up to IR?

15:27.560 --> 15:28.628
Don't you want
a CBC first?

15:28.628 --> 15:30.063
Yes, uh, you're right.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.065
Hey, Sam, lab's done
on Mrs. Garvey.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.566
I just checked,
it'll be another half hour.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.368
Hey, Dr. Weaver...

15:35.368 --> 15:37.670
the search committee meeting's
been moved up to 12:30.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.206
All right, Jerry,
thank you.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.441
Dr. Kovac.
Dr. Lockhart.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.143
There's something
not right about Glenda.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.245
Hey, that sounds
like a movie, huh?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.680
Like, Something Not Right
About Glenda.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.550
Like a body snatchers thing
with a shaky camera.
Morris.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.153
I want to re-scan her.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.055
Really? Why?

15:55.055 --> 15:56.489
Because
she's altered.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.725
Yeah, but she's a drunk.
How can you even tell?

15:58.725 --> 16:02.662
Dr. Clemente,
why don't you...

16:02.662 --> 16:05.232
Why don't we let Dr. Lockhart
present the case?

16:05.232 --> 16:08.035
Absolutely.
Look, she's disoriented,
she's repeating questions.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.602
I just want to get
another CT.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.738
How long has she
been here?
About six hours.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.374
Luka, your malrotation
in Exam Four is puking blood.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.176
I'll check back.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.344
Yeah, well...

16:17.344 --> 16:19.279
Is she responding
to commands?

16:19.279 --> 16:20.347
Yes.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.282
Hand squeeze
and eye opening.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.484
Rule of thumb: if a patient's
exam is non focal

16:24.484 --> 16:26.386
and they're responding to
commands, just observe and wait.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.288
Dr. Clemente,
Ortho on line two.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.622
Yeah, okay.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.463
Yeah, I'm going
to re-scan her.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.131
Can you call CT, let them
know we're on the way

16:38.131 --> 16:39.799
and have the blood bank
send a unit of FFP

16:39.799 --> 16:41.468
and a six pack
of platelets.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.502
You sure about that?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.271
Yes, I am.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.672
( chuckling )

16:45.672 --> 16:47.074
What's this,
your bachelor party?

16:47.074 --> 16:49.076
( chuckling )

16:49.076 --> 16:51.544
There's not going
to be one of those.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.779
Well, you didn't give me
much time to plan it,

16:52.779 --> 16:55.715
having your wedding today.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.251
I don't think there's going
to be one of those either.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.387
What, so I don't get
to be your best man?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.322
I mean, you were
going to ask me, right?

17:06.259 --> 17:10.097
I don't know, man, I...

17:10.097 --> 17:13.099
You know, maybe this
was just all too fast.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.835
You know, I mean,
I think she's scared.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.670
Well, it is kind of
a strong move

17:17.670 --> 17:19.506
to the hoop, man.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.175
Yeah, but I was going
to ask her before.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.710
But...

17:26.846 --> 17:28.848
You know, over in Iraq,
I mean, guys got married

17:28.848 --> 17:31.151
the week they shipped out.

17:31.151 --> 17:34.521
I know 'cause
I worked on them.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.724
Arms missing, legs gone...

17:37.724 --> 17:39.592
faces half blown off.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.530
But the thing they were
in the most pain about

17:43.530 --> 17:45.632
was the pain they were going
to cause somebody else.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.800
So I told myself if I ever
made it through this...

17:47.800 --> 17:50.270
And you did.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.139
So you asked her now.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.640
Yeah.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.312
Well, I...

17:59.312 --> 18:01.148
I mean, kind of.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.850
Kind of?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.588
( French rap music playing )

18:08.588 --> 18:10.190
Is this French rap?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.624
MC Solaar.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.728
Do you understand
what they're saying?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.730
I can't understand
any of them.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.831
You want contrast
with this?

18:18.831 --> 18:19.832
No.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.672
Whoa, ugly.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.707
( alarm )

18:29.542 --> 18:31.244
Glenda?

18:32.845 --> 18:34.747
Glenda?

18:34.747 --> 18:35.882
Okay, stop the scan.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.584
Few more cuts
and we're done.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.786
Stop the scan and get
the code team up here now.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.657
Excuse me.
Move.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.559
I'm in.
Hyperventilate her.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.461
What's going on?
You can see
what's going on.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.862
Equal breath sounds.
Abby.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.298
I got this.
Sats not picking up.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.300
50 of manitol.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.768
So what happened?
Well, meet Glenda, my altered
drunk head lac.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.670
While you guys were
jerking each other off,

18:57.670 --> 18:58.838
she was bleeding
into her head.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.407
B.P.'s 170/110.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.674
What did you
tell her to do?

19:01.674 --> 19:03.276
Same thing you would've--
observation.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.812
But she was responding
to commands at the time.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.780
Okay, go ahead
and order the platelets.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.549
I already did, if I had waited
for either one of you

19:09.549 --> 19:11.318
to sign off on this woman,
she'd already be dead.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.885
Neurosurgery's
ready for her.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.588
Okay, can we all agree she needs
to go up to the OR? Good.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.267
Throwing PVCs.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.735
RASGOTRA:
Can't see well enough
to find it.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.837
DUBENKO:
Get control blindly, Neela.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.973
Here, give me your hands.

19:33.973 --> 19:37.644
What do you feel?

19:37.644 --> 19:40.913
The liver,
the edge is smooth.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.550
B.P.'s dropping.
66/35.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.518
Focus.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.487
There's a defect.
There's a tear in the SMA.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.256
Over 1,900 cc blood loss.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.657
Losing the battle here, guys.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.958
Direct pressure, Neela.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.493
Control it.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.694
That's it.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.329
Hold steady pressure.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.764
Suction.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.001
Hold it.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.370
Satinsky.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.440
Clamp the bleeder.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.016
And we have liftoff.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.518
Systolic's
coming back.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.420
Great job, Dr. Rasgotra.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.855
Now we just have to run the
bowel before we close him up.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.758
Neela.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.527
Welcome, Dr. Gallant.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.596
Your bride-to-be here just
saved this guy's life.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.264
Michael, what are you
doing here?

20:31.264 --> 20:32.865
I, uh, I need
to talk to you.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.335
Well, now's not a good time.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.936
Well, I just wanted
to tell you that...

20:36.936 --> 20:38.571
Michael, please.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.806
Tell her what,
Dr. Gallant?

20:39.806 --> 20:42.008
Go ahead.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.644
You know,
when I was away... uh...

20:47.013 --> 20:49.649
thinking about you gave me
some other place to be,

20:49.649 --> 20:54.020
someplace peaceful
where I could belong.

20:54.020 --> 20:58.325
Now, maybe... maybe all
of this has been too fast

20:58.325 --> 21:00.293
and I know that's scary and...

21:00.293 --> 21:01.961
maybe I didn't ask you
the right way.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.734
But I just want us
to be together.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.437
So I'm asking you now, Neela...

21:10.437 --> 21:13.506
will you marry me?

21:13.506 --> 21:15.475
Will you marry me today?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.081
fell through the ice
playing hockey on a pond.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.683
Doing what?
I know
it sounds stupid.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.017
Not only
does it sound stupid...

21:25.017 --> 21:26.819
Dr. Morris, perhaps
you'd like to let us

21:26.819 --> 21:28.688
hear the rest
of the case.

21:28.688 --> 21:29.689
Hey, I need
to talk to you.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.623
Okay.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.492
Altered
and hypothermic.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.860
Temp's too low
to register.
He's not shivering.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.028
Heart rate's 74,
BP 100 over 47.

21:36.028 --> 21:36.963
BARNETT:
Hey, man,
when's the ceremony?

21:36.963 --> 21:37.964
Not sure yet.

21:37.964 --> 21:38.765
Okay, let us know.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.032
Yeah.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.934
Hey, Frank,
where's Jerry?

21:41.934 --> 21:44.070
Left early to get
into his ministerial mode.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.672
This thing
better be happening

21:45.672 --> 21:46.673
'cause we got a temp
coming to cover the desk.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.375
It is Frank.
Don't worry.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.776
I'm off. Cleared it
with Dr. Weaver.

21:49.776 --> 21:50.810
Okay.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.445
So we need
to go get a license.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.780
And rings.
And rings.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.114
We'll call you
with the details.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.716
You are coming,
right?

21:56.716 --> 21:58.651
Yeah, went home at lunch,
got my best suit.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.920
Wish us luck.

22:00.920 --> 22:05.091
Gonna need more than that...
but what do I know?

22:05.091 --> 22:06.593
WEAVER:
Repeat rectal temp,

22:06.593 --> 22:09.562
portable chest, EKG, CBC,
chemistry and coags.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.398
Crackles... may have
aspirated some water.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.899
Sats only 88.
He needs an airway.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.000
I've got it.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.635
Dr. Barnett.

22:17.670 --> 22:21.541
Uh, yes, uh, eight-oh,
20 etomidate, 100 sux.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.909
MAN:
I hope it's okay.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.577
I made the paramedics
bring me with them.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.045
TAGGART:
It's fine, Mr...

22:26.045 --> 22:28.448
Spevacek.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.716
There's a pond where we grew up

22:29.716 --> 22:32.652
and a few of us took up
our old skates...

22:32.652 --> 22:34.721
knocked the puck around,
you know, for old times.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.823
Bolus a liter
of warm saline

22:36.823 --> 22:38.658
and call Respiratory
for a vent.

22:38.658 --> 22:39.759
Rectal temp, 86.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.061
Uh, suction.
Osborne waves.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.463
He's at risk for an arrhythmia.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.566
Tube.

22:46.566 --> 22:49.869
Prep for bilateral chest tubes
for pleural irrigation.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.104
Um, with all due
respect, Dr. Weaver,

22:52.104 --> 22:54.441
peritoneal dialysis
is better.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.110
Greater capacity
for heat exchange,

22:58.110 --> 22:59.846
warms the solid organs faster.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.815
It's an
interesting approach.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.652
That's what the Navy SEALS do...
really.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.654
Proceed, Dr. Morris.

23:07.654 --> 23:08.855
Okay, okay, uh...

23:08.855 --> 23:11.123
Betadine and a DPL tray.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.161
So you never
actually saw him?

23:15.161 --> 23:16.629
I told you,
I see him all the time.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.631
He's always up here
sniffing around.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.700
Sniffing around?
He's not a dog.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.669
He likes this girl
that volunteers.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.904
You know what I mean.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.807
I'm sorry. They've been at
this for a couple of days.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.609
How many people have keys
to the storeroom?

23:29.609 --> 23:32.011
That information isn't
for general release.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.145
Then let us see
the tape.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.514
Gotta get the chief's approval.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.682
So call the chief.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.183
He'll be back
in an hour.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.719
So, we got no chief,
no tape

23:39.719 --> 23:41.721
and he didn't
even see KJ.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.623
I don't check every room
every minute of the day.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.090
Maybe you should.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.958
Darnell.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.594
'Cause then he would've
seen it wasn't my son.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.761
Okay, okay, we'll talk
to the chief.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.697
We'll get the tape.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.566
It takes time to rewind,
run the tape forward.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.701
Holds 24 hours,

23:54.701 --> 23:56.235
not like
you just punch in.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.504
I got time.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.505
You going somewhere?

23:59.839 --> 24:01.641
We'll be here.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.809
Come on, man.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.945
TAGGART:
Core temp's 88.3.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.047
Up a couple
of degrees.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.649
Hang another liter
of warm saline.

24:09.649 --> 24:10.583
We've got to tip him
on his right side.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.051
I've got the head.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.753
Can I help?
We've got it.
Thank you, though.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.622
MORRIS:
Here we go--
one, two, three...

24:15.622 --> 24:18.024
Just a few PVCs.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.258
Why are you doing this?

24:19.258 --> 24:20.893
This drains the fluid
through the abdomen.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.061
How long does that take?

24:22.061 --> 24:23.696
Uh, 30 to 60 minutes.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.197
Human meat takes time
to thaw.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.533
Dr. Morris...

24:26.533 --> 24:27.667
TAGGART:
Sure we can't

24:27.667 --> 24:28.868
get you a seat,
Mr. Spevacek?

24:28.868 --> 24:30.937
Harry lived
across the street.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.205
Must've been 15 kids
up and down our block.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.709
We played hockey
all winter.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.878
I fell in the ice once,

24:40.813 --> 24:43.282
Harry pulled me out.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.818
Then today...

24:47.219 --> 24:50.790
Harry fell in.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.125
And I tried to help him...

24:54.727 --> 24:55.762
but I couldn't.

24:58.565 --> 25:02.034
Just, you know, a little out
of practice, I guess.

25:02.034 --> 25:05.204
I'm sure you did
all that you could.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.172
I hope so.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.707
He's in V-tach.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.576
Roll him.
What's happening?

25:09.576 --> 25:10.977
No pulse.
Get the crash cart.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.579
Starting compressions.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.980
When I get upstairs,

25:13.980 --> 25:16.182
will I get my own room,
or do I have to share?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.750
I'm not sure.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.285
Stop complaining,
Stewy.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.753
You already got
to skip school.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.221
Patricia.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.790
I don't see why
I couldn't stay
in the gym.

25:23.790 --> 25:24.924
I'm missing practice.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.694
Patricia, please.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.328
Dr. Lockhart, do you know
how much longer it will be?

25:29.328 --> 25:31.664
Well, I can page
the pediatrician on call.

25:31.664 --> 25:32.665
Are you still
doing okay?

25:35.968 --> 25:37.937
Clear!

25:37.937 --> 25:39.639
No change.
Still V-fib.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.940
Again. Charge to 360.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.975
Clear!

25:42.975 --> 25:44.977
He's not going
to respond to shocks
until we warm him up.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.013
Resume compressions.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.616
Sam, 100 milligrams
lidocaine IV.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.183
Uh, excuse me, Dr. Weaver.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.652
I think we should use
bretylium instead.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.053
What are you
talking about?

25:54.053 --> 25:56.122
They took that out of the ACLS
guidelines years ago.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.057
Yes, but there was
a big study in the '80s.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.859
That's you reference,
something from the '80s?

25:59.859 --> 26:01.160
Yes, Dr. Weaver,
it is.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.762
And it clearly showed bretylium

26:02.762 --> 26:04.163
to be the anti-arrhythmic
of choice

26:04.163 --> 26:05.998
in hypothermia.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.237
Core temps up to 89.1.

26:15.642 --> 26:19.045
350 milligrams of bretylium IV.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.286
Given his recent immigration
from Vietnam,

26:27.286 --> 26:28.888
you've got to consider
empiric triple therapy.

26:28.888 --> 26:29.789
Right, right, but if
you have Hepatitis C...

26:29.789 --> 26:31.991
Excuse me.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.325
It's going to be
a disaster...
His liver function
is perfectly fine.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.394
For the moment,
maybe, but...
Hey, hey!

26:35.394 --> 26:37.664
Stewy Kenig, five-year-old
with fever and cough.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.932
Non-toxic appearing
with bilateral crackles on exam,

26:39.932 --> 26:42.368
sats 92 on room air,
100 on five liters.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.103
Mom's freaked out
by radiation.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.905
Refused a chest X ray.

26:45.905 --> 26:48.207
So treating presumptive
pneumonia with amp and azithro.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.409
CBCs pending,
got 20 per kilo of NS

26:50.409 --> 26:51.978
and is being admitted
to pedes since,

26:51.978 --> 26:53.245
although stable,
I can't send him home

26:53.245 --> 26:54.881
with an O2 requirement.

26:54.881 --> 26:57.149
That's the plan.
Do you concur?

26:57.149 --> 26:59.919
I don't know.
Azithro? Have you tried...?

26:59.919 --> 27:03.389
Do you concur?

27:03.389 --> 27:04.190
Yeah.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.357
Thanks.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.395
The Chief of Security
met with him.

27:09.395 --> 27:13.099
McCauley kept stalling,
then finally came clean.

27:13.099 --> 27:16.102
There was a theft, but
there were no videotapes

27:16.102 --> 27:17.704
and no suspects.

27:17.704 --> 27:18.805
No tapes at all?

27:18.805 --> 27:20.840
No. KJ did nothing wrong.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.875
Some camera goes missing
and this fat ass figures

27:22.875 --> 27:24.777
it must have been
the black kid.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.312
DUBENKO:
Yeah, there was absolutely
no excuse for it.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.114
It was an unconscionable
thing to do.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.949
So where's this McCauley going
to be working tomorrow?

27:29.949 --> 27:31.884
Not here.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.453
Listen, Mr. Thibeaux,
um, from what

27:34.453 --> 27:36.188
everybody's been saying,
it sounds like

27:36.188 --> 27:38.357
KJ's been doing
a great job around here.

27:38.357 --> 27:43.229
He did not deserve this
and I'm very, very sorry.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.898
On behalf of the entire
hospital, I apologize.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.735
Why don't you go
tell that to KJ?

27:48.735 --> 27:50.136
Yeah.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.044
Sure you don't
want anything?

27:58.044 --> 28:01.313
Thanks, man.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.116
Guess it always comes down
to the black check, doesn't it?

28:06.485 --> 28:09.321
No matter how good your job is,
where you live,

28:09.321 --> 28:10.790
how much money you make...

28:10.790 --> 28:12.358
In the end, cops
pull you over

28:12.358 --> 28:14.761
for driving through
a white neighborhood.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.395
I'm done
with this place.

28:16.395 --> 28:17.764
I'm not doing
this anymore.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.832
The hell you ain't.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.834
You're coming here
every day till you
finished your service.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.236
That's right. And I'm going
to make sure you work harder

28:24.236 --> 28:26.272
than any other
volunteer up in here.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.775
So no more going
out for doughnuts
and chasing skirts.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.109
Man, what for?

28:30.109 --> 28:31.243
They always going
to be on my back,

28:31.243 --> 28:32.945
no matter how good
I do.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.480
Yeah, and it's going
to be like that forever

28:34.480 --> 28:35.514
so get used to it.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.016
Can't think about it.

28:37.016 --> 28:40.186
Just live your life
and do your best.

28:40.186 --> 28:45.457
You got to stay in the game, KJ,
otherwise they win.

28:45.457 --> 28:49.095
Look, I'm sorry about all this,
all right? All right?

28:52.198 --> 28:53.365
Where is everybody?

28:53.365 --> 28:55.534
Hi, I'm Maureen.
Can I help you?

28:55.534 --> 28:57.003
Who are you?

28:57.003 --> 28:58.404
I'm the temp.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.272
Are you out
of high school?

29:00.272 --> 29:02.875
I'm 21, but I have
my mother's cheekbones

29:02.875 --> 29:03.943
and my father's chin,

29:03.943 --> 29:05.344
and everyone always says

29:05.344 --> 29:07.446
that that combination makes
you look younger, so...

29:07.446 --> 29:09.048
Hey, you still here?

29:09.048 --> 29:10.482
Yeah, I'm looking
for Ray.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.151
I have a couple of patients
I need to sign out unless

29:12.151 --> 29:13.920
I want to wear this
to the wedding.
I can take them.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.221
Or I can,
if you'd rather.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.056
Sorry. Luka beat you to it.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.025
Let me walk
you outside.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.362
And you would be?

29:23.362 --> 29:24.897
I'm Maureen the temp.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.098
Well, hello,
Maureen the temp.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.934
Are you...?

29:27.934 --> 29:28.935
I know what
you're going to ask me

29:28.935 --> 29:30.502
and I'm 21.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.972
I have my mother's cheekbones
and my father's chin

29:32.972 --> 29:34.540
and everyone always says
that that combination

29:34.540 --> 29:36.008
makes you look younger.

29:36.008 --> 29:39.111
Is that what
they say?
Yeah.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.214
TEF with aspiration,
going up for a bronch.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.182
Jellyfish sting.

29:43.182 --> 29:43.983
Jellyfish?

29:43.983 --> 29:45.051
Yeah, it was a pet.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.853
Obs for 30 minutes
and then home.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.254
And Stewy, my little guy
with pneumonia,

29:48.254 --> 29:50.022
is hanging out
on O2.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.357
Pedes has seen him, we're
just waiting on a bed upstairs.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.325
Well presented plan,
by the way.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.894
Yes, I had
to do something.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.262
Well, like you said,

29:56.262 --> 29:57.930
I'm not very good
at being agreeable.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.265
I didn't say that.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.566
You implied it.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.468
I said it was
a lot to ask,

30:02.468 --> 30:03.936
and it turns out
I was right,

30:03.936 --> 30:05.171
not that I'm happy
about it.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.606
No, of course not.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.441
I'm going
to be really late.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.977
Are you coming
to this wedding?

30:10.977 --> 30:12.144
It's in the hospital chapel.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.212
I don't know.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.313
Lots of things to finish up.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.082
See you
at the reception, yeah?

30:16.082 --> 30:17.416
Right.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.186
Charge to 360.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.154
Clear.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.123
Again, 360.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.193
Clear.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.460
Sinus rhythm.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.898
And... we've got
a pulse.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.399
Ice hockey dude
is warm and alive.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.034
Welcome back, Harry.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.535
Temp's 90.
You want some more warm saline?

30:36.535 --> 30:38.570
Uh, no, no.
Keep him at 90.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.873
Auto-induced
hypothermia will
protect the brain.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.209
All right!
Everybody, way to go.
Is he okay?

30:43.209 --> 30:44.343
Your friend's going
to spend the night in ICU

30:44.343 --> 30:46.078
for observation.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.947
But he's stable and he has
a good chance for recovery.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.382
Thank you all
so much.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.518
Mr. Spevacek, you are
absolutely welcome.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.054
WEAVER:
Okay, take out
the DPL catheters

30:55.054 --> 30:57.423
and get him a unit bed.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.932
Hey...
it was a good job, man.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.115
What's going on?!
Suction.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.316
Heart rate's
dropping.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.551
Give me some cricoid.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.485
Is this Abby's pneumonia
patient?

31:26.485 --> 31:28.154
CLEMENTE:
Is she gone?

31:28.154 --> 31:29.388
KOVAC:
Let's worry
about the airway.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.490
Respiratory distress,
not moving air.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.425
Send a blood gas.
Please tell me
what's going on.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.061
Pulse is 47.
Pull out.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.595
No, I got it. I'm in.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.634
Good color change.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.570
His oxygen level
was dangerously low.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.572
We had to take over
his breathing.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.639
X-ray's up.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.512
TAGGART:
Took me a while
to get the mom to agree.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.214
She didn't want
the radiation.

31:55.214 --> 31:56.582
Not little Stewy's
biggest problem.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.050
Interstitial infiltrates.
There.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.419
Maybe staph aureus?

32:00.419 --> 32:03.222
Could be MRSA.
We should add Vanco.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.457
Check out
the white count.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.026
0.4?

32:07.026 --> 32:08.494
White count should be
through the roof

32:08.494 --> 32:09.996
unless he hasn't got
any white cells left.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.431
And this is PCP
pneumonia.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.000
Any reason for this kid
to be imunosuppressed?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.334
Chemo, steroids?

32:15.334 --> 32:17.136
Nothing in the history.

32:17.136 --> 32:20.006
All right, who's going
to ask the mom?

32:21.307 --> 32:24.543
Mrs. Kenig, uh, the type
of lung infection

32:24.543 --> 32:25.711
your son has...

32:29.548 --> 32:31.050
We ran a number of tests.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.351
I didn't say
you could do that.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.419
He was about
to stop breathing

32:33.419 --> 32:35.187
and we needed
to know why.

32:35.187 --> 32:38.624
The tests showed your son
has pneumocystis pneumonia.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.160
It's a type
of infection
we only see

32:41.160 --> 32:44.330
when the immune system
is not working.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.532
We'd like to test your son
for HIV.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.699
CLEMENTE:
And if he does
have the virus,

32:47.699 --> 32:49.535
we can recommend
medications that...

32:49.535 --> 32:52.538
Here we go with the viral
theory of AIDS.

32:52.538 --> 32:55.374
Invented so biotech companies
could charge people

32:55.374 --> 32:57.509
50 bucks a pop for some
bogus tests

32:57.509 --> 32:59.545
when they're actually dying
from real problems.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.513
Excuse me?
Real problems?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.782
Pollution, drug addiction,
toxins,

33:03.782 --> 33:05.351
but nobody wants
to deal with those.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.553
It's better to
call it a virus

33:07.553 --> 33:10.556
and sell a vaccine--
the easy fix.

33:10.556 --> 33:13.325
I have talked to 50 doctors
since I have been diagnosed

33:13.325 --> 33:14.626
and it's always the same thing.

33:14.626 --> 33:15.694
"HIV causes..."

33:15.694 --> 33:18.197
Wait, wait.
You're infected?

33:18.197 --> 33:20.132
I'm not infected with anything.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.101
I carry the HIV virus
as do millions

33:22.101 --> 33:23.469
of other
healthy people.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.071
You don't believe
HIV causes AIDS?

33:25.071 --> 33:25.804
No, I don't.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.374
Oh, lady, you're nuts.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.076
I was diagnosed 14 years ago

33:30.076 --> 33:31.710
and I haven't been sick
a day in my life.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.712
So you didn't take AZT
while you were pregnant?

33:33.712 --> 33:35.347
Why would I do that?
Oh, I don't know.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.782
Maybe to prevent your child
from getting AIDS.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.317
Which is, by the way,

33:38.317 --> 33:40.386
what little Stewy might have.
Dr. Clemente.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.621
Are you so sure AZT
doesn't cause AIDS?

33:42.621 --> 33:44.690
Everyone knows it
suppresses the
immune system.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.625
Lady, lady, you're
out there, okay?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.127
I'm a conspiracy
freak, too,

33:48.127 --> 33:49.595
don't get me wrong,

33:49.595 --> 33:50.696
and the drug companies
are trying to screw us...

33:50.696 --> 33:52.264
Doctor...
but when we tell you

33:52.264 --> 33:53.565
that your child
has a life-threatening disease

33:53.565 --> 33:54.733
and you jeopardize
his life

33:54.733 --> 33:56.268
to prove one of your
crackpot theories,

33:56.268 --> 33:58.337
you're just as bad
as they are, okay?

33:58.337 --> 34:00.272
If he dies, is that going
to make you happy?

34:00.272 --> 34:02.108
Dr. Clemente, I'll take
care of this, okay?

34:02.108 --> 34:04.243
She knew she was infected
with HIV

34:04.243 --> 34:05.577
and she did nothing
to protect her child.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.146
It's the most moronic,

34:07.146 --> 34:08.480
selfish...

34:13.252 --> 34:18.556
So, you were saying
you never even had Stewy tested?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.525
No.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.594
What about Patricia?

34:36.308 --> 34:39.311
( organ music playing )

34:39.311 --> 34:41.347
( sobbing gently )

34:59.465 --> 35:00.866
Ah, there you are.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.201
They're waiting for you.
What's going on?

35:02.201 --> 35:03.469
Oh, scheduling conflict.

35:03.469 --> 35:04.636
Well, you could have put
a note on the door.

35:04.636 --> 35:05.671
Well, you could
have been on time.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.173
Well...
Here, take one.

35:07.173 --> 35:07.906
We're stealing
their flowers?

35:07.906 --> 35:09.708
Nah, just take one.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.443
Where are we going?
Come on.

35:17.383 --> 35:18.717
( sighs )

35:22.554 --> 35:24.890
Child Life took
Patricia up to play
some video games.

35:24.890 --> 35:29.561
Yeah. I asked about
their father-- he's
not in the picture.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.897
She will let us treat the
pneumonia, but won't consent

35:31.897 --> 35:36.202
to an HIV test, and doesn't even
want to discuss medication.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.839
If we don't get this boy
on the cocktail...

35:43.475 --> 35:46.645
How do people
get like this?

36:01.860 --> 36:06.465
When my son,
Alex, was five,

36:06.465 --> 36:09.701
the doctor thought he
might have meningitis.

36:09.701 --> 36:12.971
Wanted to do a
spinal tap on him.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.441
I'm a nurse, and I
didn't want him to do it.

36:15.441 --> 36:16.842
I was worried and scared.

36:16.842 --> 36:20.746
I didn't want anything
hurting my kid.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.949
I don't want anything
hurting Stewy.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.920
Stewy is already hurting,
Mrs. Kenig.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.559
Everyone is entitled
to their beliefs,

36:33.559 --> 36:36.262
but the truth--
here, in this room,
right now-- is if you

36:36.262 --> 36:37.796
let this go on like this,
there's not

36:37.796 --> 36:39.565
gonna be a doctor
that can help him.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.272
He only has you.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.689
Why do we have to go
through the kitchen?

37:03.689 --> 37:06.358
Because Michael and Neela are
waiting by the front door.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.959
Well, it's not
a surprise party.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.595
Oh, Abby!
Oh, man!

37:09.595 --> 37:11.763
If this isn't every
bride's dream come true.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.565
Come on.
I'm coming.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.841
That's a nice tie.

37:22.841 --> 37:26.312
Thanks. And a lovely
outfit, as well.

37:26.312 --> 37:27.946
Better
without the lab coat.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.381
What are we waiting for?

37:29.381 --> 37:30.716
I have no idea.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.684
Where have you been?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.986
( whispers ):
Take that... take that...

37:38.957 --> 37:40.726
Hey.
What happened
to the Chapel?

37:40.726 --> 37:41.993
Scheduling conflict.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.429
Yes, I know that...

37:43.429 --> 37:45.497
Oh, but...
Shh! Shh! Shh!

37:46.565 --> 37:50.369
( guests murmuring )

37:50.369 --> 37:51.970
( chuckling )

37:54.940 --> 37:58.344
( guests humming
"Here Comes the Bride" )

38:04.616 --> 38:06.585
( humming stops )

38:06.585 --> 38:09.355
Still won't change
her mind about Patricia?

38:09.355 --> 38:10.889
Says she's a healthy
young girl,

38:10.889 --> 38:12.791
she doesn't
need any testing.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.526
We're gonna have to get
a court order.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.528
Well, at least she's
gonna let us help Stewy.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.063
One out of two--
that's something.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.098
I'm gonna go up
with them to the PICU.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.368
Okay, thanks.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.376
Oh, hey. So, the wacko finally
gave in, huh?

38:30.376 --> 38:31.643
No thanks to you.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.712
Yeah, look, I'm
sorry about that.

38:33.712 --> 38:36.482
I just... I don't know.
I just had to yell
at her to just...

38:36.482 --> 38:39.084
Listen, I hope there won't be
any hard feelings, but, uh...

38:39.084 --> 38:41.887
Kerry let me know I'm going
to be the new E.R. chief.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.755
That's awesome.
That's awesome.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.857
You know... you know,
when I withdrew my name,

38:45.857 --> 38:48.126
I was hoping
they'd pick you.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.695
You withdrew your name?

38:49.695 --> 38:51.797
Yeah. I just had a
lot of stuff going on...

38:51.797 --> 38:53.064
It's... a long
story, man.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.966
But you're the best
guy for the job.

38:54.966 --> 38:55.967
Congratulations.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.936
Thanks.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.906
Uh... going to
the wedding reception?

39:00.906 --> 39:02.908
You know, I'd love to--
I really would--

39:02.908 --> 39:04.910
but Maureen over here...
way in over her head.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.745
Doesn't know where the
forks and knives goes,

39:06.745 --> 39:08.046
so I'm going to
supervise her...

39:08.046 --> 39:10.416
If you know what I mean.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.085
GUESTS ( chanting ):
Go! Go! Go! Go!

39:14.085 --> 39:17.423
( Barry Manilow's
"Copacabana" playing )

39:17.423 --> 39:21.993
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

39:21.993 --> 39:23.829
( shouting and cheering )

39:23.829 --> 39:25.764
Do we have to call
you Chief now?

39:25.764 --> 39:27.132
Very funny.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.767
If you get
interviewed,
they'll say:

39:28.767 --> 39:30.669
"We're here at County,
talking to Chief Kovac."

39:30.669 --> 39:33.104
They don't do it that way.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.040
I'm just saying I think
it's cute if it's a guy.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.444
And if the chief is a woman?

39:38.444 --> 39:41.747
I don't think women should be
put in positions of leadership.

39:41.747 --> 39:43.549
Do you?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.787
Peanut?
Ah...

39:48.787 --> 39:52.591
Young love-- they
just have to show it
off to everybody.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.661
( sighs )

39:55.661 --> 39:57.663
Here's to discretion.

39:57.663 --> 40:00.065
Propriety.
Maturity.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.567
Well...

40:01.567 --> 40:04.503
No, no, not that.
( mutters )

40:04.503 --> 40:07.172
( Barry Manilow's "Can't Smile
Without You" playing )

40:10.476 --> 40:13.111
That'll be me someday.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.813
Yup.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.749
That's gonna be me.

40:17.749 --> 40:21.152
I should have said
something earlier.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.821
Excuse me?

40:22.821 --> 40:26.825
I should have said
something earlier.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.761
But I want you to know that
I have a lot of respect

40:29.761 --> 40:33.899
for how you handled
that trauma today.

40:33.899 --> 40:37.168
And there was some
truth in what you said
about me being...

40:37.168 --> 40:40.071
up in Administration.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.173
I'm a little out
of practice.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.710
But I-I want you to know
that I'm going to start

40:44.710 --> 40:49.648
spending more time
down in the E.R.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.917
What?

41:00.025 --> 41:03.261
( cheering and shouting )

41:03.261 --> 41:05.664
Really, we really want to, uh...

41:05.664 --> 41:06.932
thank everybody...

41:06.932 --> 41:08.634
Well, you said
that already.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.536
And when we get settled,
I want all of you guys

41:10.536 --> 41:11.837
to, uh, come out
and visit us.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.672
And you can all
come and visit me

41:13.672 --> 41:15.541
tomorrow morning at work,
7:00 a.m.

41:15.541 --> 41:17.909
GALLANT:
Uh, really.
We love you all. Thank you.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.912
Yeah, and, uh... we're
leaving now. Good night.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.280
Whoo!

41:22.280 --> 41:24.282
( cheering )

41:24.282 --> 41:25.851
Where are they going
on their honeymoon?

41:25.851 --> 41:28.253
My apartment.
( chuckles )

41:28.253 --> 41:31.056
( sings along with radio ):
* Her name was Lola,
she was a showgirl *

41:31.056 --> 41:33.592
* With yellow feathers
in her hair *

41:33.592 --> 41:35.894
* And a dress cut down
to there *

41:35.894 --> 41:38.764
* I don't remember...
( chuckles )

41:38.764 --> 41:42.801
( hums melody )

41:45.070 --> 41:46.237
( giggles )

41:46.237 --> 41:48.306
Okay, well, thanks for the ride.

41:48.306 --> 41:49.741
( chuckles )

41:49.741 --> 41:51.843
That bad, huh?
No.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.912
I would just...
keep your day job.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.847
What? You never
sing in the car?

41:55.847 --> 41:57.749
You know, when you're...
when you're alone?

41:57.749 --> 42:01.319
Sometimes I do, yeah, but
you're not alone in the car.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.955
Yeah, I know.

42:03.955 --> 42:06.091
I'm just kidding. I...

42:18.837 --> 42:21.072
Would you like to...?

42:32.117 --> 42:33.785
Come on, we can make it.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.621
You try running
with a sari on.

42:35.621 --> 42:37.789
( both panting )

42:37.789 --> 42:39.257
( sighs )

42:45.731 --> 42:48.033
What a day.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.334
What a night.

42:49.334 --> 42:52.037
We're actually married.

42:52.037 --> 42:54.005
Yeah.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.014
( sighs )

43:28.273 --> 43:30.909
( whispers ):
Do you really think we
should be doing this?

43:34.813 --> 43:35.947
I do.
