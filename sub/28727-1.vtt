00:32.433 --> 00:33.198
- Did you make a decision?

00:35.036 --> 00:37.903
- Northwestern is
my dream school.

00:37.938 --> 00:38.570
I have to go.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.740
- I was hoping you'd say that.

00:41.776 --> 00:43.609
- But what about us?

00:43.644 --> 00:45.077
- Just pack me in your suitcase.

00:45.112 --> 00:47.312
(chuckling)

00:47.348 --> 00:49.014
We'll be fine.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.816
Just four short years.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.584
- Of long distance.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.686
- And then you'll move back.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.190
And until then, I'll come visit,
you'll come back to Florida

00:58.225 --> 01:01.260
and no matter how far we
are, whenever we're out on

01:01.295 --> 01:03.762
the water, it'll be like
we're back together.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.964
- Although I heard
kayaking on Lake Michigan

01:06.000 --> 01:07.199
doesn't compare to the gulf.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.402
- Oh, then maybe you shouldn't
go to Northwestern, I dunno.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.742
I love you, Alana.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.611
- I love you, Kai.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.449
And that's all that matters.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.856
(upbeat music)

01:37.231 --> 01:39.064
We all want love.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.333
Growing up I saw my
parents so in love

01:41.368 --> 01:43.001
and knew that was what I wanted.

01:43.037 --> 01:45.671
But when it came to dating,
I was impractical about it.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.140
I chased the fairytale
romance even when

01:48.175 --> 01:50.142
I knew it was just a fairytale.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.812
- And that inspired
us to dream up Closer,

01:53.848 --> 01:56.014
a dating app that
finds users fulfilling

01:56.050 --> 01:58.317
and practical long-term
relationships.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.653
- Our goal is to bring
users closer to love

02:01.689 --> 02:04.656
by matching compatible
people in close proximity.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.159
People we cross
paths with everyday.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.661
- And, if you're wondering
about our success rate, well--

02:09.697 --> 02:14.566
- We're not just Closer's CEO
and CTO, we're also members.

02:15.936 --> 02:19.004
A year ago I met my
boyfriend Evan on Closer.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.707
For years we had lived three
blocks from each other.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.676
Went to the same coffee
shop, gym, dry cleaners,

02:24.712 --> 02:27.546
and never crossed
paths, until Closer.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.947
- Closer works.

02:28.983 --> 02:32.384
It worked for us,
at least one of us.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.788
Although, I did just get
a new 99% match on Closer.

02:36.824 --> 02:40.192
He loves Tiki bars,
salsa dancing and dogs.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.194
- You just described yourself.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.395
- I know.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.730
And he works the
next building over.

02:44.765 --> 02:45.797
We're having dinner tonight.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.099
- That's amazing.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.233
- I'm so excited.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.902
- Okay, back to it.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.606
What we need from
you at Atlas Capital

02:54.642 --> 02:57.709
is the funding to
take Closer national.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.913
We've been beta testing to
great success in Chicago,

03:00.948 --> 03:04.550
San Francisco, L.A., New
York and St. Petersburg,

03:04.585 --> 03:07.119
Florida, where I'm from.

03:07.154 --> 03:11.323
But now, with your help,
we can take it nationwide

03:11.358 --> 03:14.893
and bring singles
everywhere closer.

03:18.933 --> 03:19.898
What do you think?

03:19.934 --> 03:21.733
- I think, look less nervous.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.402
(groaning)
We've got this.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.338
And if we don't, the coffee
shop in the lobby is hiring, so.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.440
(chuckling)

03:28.475 --> 03:31.810
- Renee, whatever happens,
I'm glad we did this together.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.146
- Me too, now let's
go get that funding.

03:38.285 --> 03:40.519
(golf club whacking)

03:40.554 --> 03:42.454
- It seems like Atlas
really like our pitch.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.690
Said they were intrigued and
would discuss with their team.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.924
- That's incredible.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.092
- Thank you, but hold
the confetti until

03:47.127 --> 03:48.460
we hear something concrete.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.970
Is everything okay?

03:58.005 --> 03:59.171
- Of course, yeah.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.107
- What are you thinking?

04:02.142 --> 04:04.443
- Ah, just that our dates
would be a little more fun

04:04.478 --> 04:06.645
if I didn't spend them losing.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.014
- Evan, there's no losing
on the driving range.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.216
You lose on the course.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.351
- Oh, oh, okay.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.655
- You sure you're okay?

04:17.858 --> 04:18.657
- I'm great.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.129
Oh, hey.

04:24.164 --> 04:27.766
Actually, I have a new
ball I want you to try.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.642
Alana, almost a year ago we
had our first date right here,

04:38.045 --> 04:40.746
where even with just a five
iron you still outhit me.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.147
- We argued about your
swing and I was sure

04:42.182 --> 04:43.382
we'd never have a second date.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.051
- But we did and it's
been an amazing year

04:46.086 --> 04:47.319
together ever since.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.123
We have so much fun, we
make each other laugh.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.293
You're my best friend.

04:58.198 --> 05:03.201
What I'm trying to ask
is, will you marry me?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.844
- Yes.
- Yes?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.012
- Yes, of course.

05:14.048 --> 05:15.514
- You said yes?

05:15.549 --> 05:19.551
She said yes!
(crowd applauding)

05:24.391 --> 05:25.557
Oh.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.126
Um, I'm sorry, I had it sized
off one of your other rings.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.561
I don't know what happened.

05:31.065 --> 05:33.365
- No, it's beautiful.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.366
- I'll get it resized.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.805
- Dad, it's me.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.073
Call me back.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.376
- Hey.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.877
- I knew I'd find you here.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.246
Ever heard of a little thing
called work-life balance?

05:48.282 --> 05:50.549
- Uh, no, have you?

05:50.584 --> 05:53.318
- No, and isn't it
life-work balance?

05:53.354 --> 05:54.586
(chuckling)

05:54.621 --> 05:55.921
How was your date?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.122
- It was incredible.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.323
- Mm, is he cute?

05:58.359 --> 06:01.059
- The cutest and he is so funny.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.462
Wait, you have something
you're not telling me.

06:04.631 --> 06:05.964
- How do you do that?

06:07.134 --> 06:11.737
- Well, I'm amazing and also
you're really easy to read.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.938
- Really?

06:12.973 --> 06:13.805
- So tell me.

06:17.311 --> 06:18.744
- There should be
an engagement ring

06:18.779 --> 06:21.747
on here because Evan proposed,

06:21.782 --> 06:24.649
but the ring didn't fit,
so he has to resize it.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.618
Yeah.
- Congratulations.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.653
Uh, excuse my shock.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.089
I just, I didn't realize
you guys were there yet.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.591
- I didn't either.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.861
I mean, Evan is great, but
it does feel a little fast.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.596
- And what'd your dad
say when you told him?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.631
- I keep calling but he
never answers his phone.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.800
- Then maybe you should
tell him in person.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.836
I mean, Alana, I know you've
been avoiding going home--

06:44.872 --> 06:46.338
- I'm not avoiding, Renee.

06:46.373 --> 06:49.441
- Really, how long's it
been since you've been back?

06:49.476 --> 06:51.143
- Five years.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.677
- Since your mom's memorial?

06:54.148 --> 06:56.281
That's a really long time
and I know your dad comes

06:56.316 --> 06:58.984
to visit you here, but I'm sure
he'd love to have you home.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.420
You could leave tomorrow,
stay for the weekend.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.722
- That would be a fun surprise.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.357
- See, that's the spirit.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.637
- But we just pitched Atlas.

07:18.672 --> 07:19.571
- But it'll take to hear back.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.639
- But work is crazy right now.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.140
- Yeah, but I can cover for you.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.909
- You'll never find a ticket.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.410
- Just bought you a ticket.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.678
- That fast?

07:26.713 --> 07:28.246
- Think of it as an
engagement present.

so miracles
definitely do happen.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.646

08:40.587 --> 08:42.254

think that's a bit

08:55.435 --> 08:56.768
presumptuous to order for me.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.003
- Oh, really, okay.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.638
Well, what were you gonna order?

09:00.841 --> 09:01.740
- Tangerine.

09:04.778 --> 09:05.610
But still.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.614
- Don't forget, I've known
you since you were four.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.683
I already know everything
you could ever say.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.152
- Then you know I'd say
that's also presumptuous,

09:14.187 --> 09:16.254
but I expected that
because I already know

09:16.290 --> 09:17.789
everything you can say too.

09:17.824 --> 09:22.160
So why not surprise me
and say something nice.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.061
- Okay.

09:24.631 --> 09:25.830
- Well?

09:25.899 --> 09:29.100
- If you know it's coming it's
not really a surprise, is it?

10:20.020 --> 10:21.319
I can't believe you're here.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.587
- Well, I have
something to tell you--

10:22.623 --> 10:24.255
- Is that Alana?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.190
You're back?

10:25.258 --> 10:26.424
You're back.
- Hi, Micah, good to see you.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.826
- For the orchid festival?

10:29.429 --> 10:30.662
- Yeah--
- Well, actually.

10:30.697 --> 10:31.863
- Well you have
to see what James

10:31.898 --> 10:33.164
and I have done
since taking it over.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.666
It's gonna be bigger
and better than over.

10:34.701 --> 10:38.269
More food, music, drinks,
flower vendors, expo.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.537
- Yeah, if we get
everything done in time.

10:39.573 --> 10:40.939
- Well if not it's
gonna be a disaster.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.440
- Well, either way,
we'll be entertained.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.342
- I guess I picked the
right weekend to come home.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.011
- Well, the festival's
next weekend.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.112
Can you stay a little longer?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.380
It's really gonna be amazing--

10:48.415 --> 10:51.282
- I'd love to, but work
is crazy right now.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.085
We just pitched investors and
are working on an ad campaign.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.621
- Oh, can James and I be
a part of your commercial?

10:56.657 --> 10:58.289
We can verify your
matchmaking skills.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.858
- Yeah, 'cause if you
hadn't invited me to sit

10:59.893 --> 11:02.027
with you guys everyday at
lunch all of junior year.

11:02.062 --> 11:02.961
- You were the new kid.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.629
- That you were trying
to set me up with.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.097
- Someone had to do it.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.033
From the time you were
paired up as lab partners.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.401
- They had real chemistry?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.737
- I really missed
your dad jokes.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.373
- Well we have to
run, but really, think
about saying, okay?

11:15.409 --> 11:16.508
- I'll try my best.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.611
- It's good to see you.
- All right, great to see you.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.546
- Bye.
- All right, all right, bye.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.548
Okay, what are you doing here?

11:23.583 --> 11:24.482
- Well.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.451
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, hold that thought,

11:26.486 --> 11:27.552
'cause Leah is right over there

11:27.587 --> 11:29.921
and you finally get to meet her.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.424
- Really, Leah?
- Mm hm.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.127
- [Leah] This must be Alana.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.429
- And Alana, this is Leah.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.565
- I've heard so much about you.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.301
I'm glad my dad has such
a great new neighbor.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.102
- Me too.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.806
I have to tell you, I'm so
excited to finally meet you.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.607
You're all your dad takes about.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.575
- Just a little bit.
- Really?

11:50.610 --> 11:51.843
- Okay, so I talk a little bit.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.311
- No, come on in,
let me feed you.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.746
Are you hungry, want a snack?
- Yes.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.081
- Huh, a little freshness
at Southern Fresh?

11:56.116 --> 11:58.083
- Come on in, let's eat.
- See.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.319
Okay.
- Really?

12:04.725 --> 12:07.425
- [Micah] I'm so happy
that you are home.

12:08.795 --> 12:09.627
- Me too.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.965
- Same gorgeous view, huh?

12:15.168 --> 12:16.034
- It never gets old.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.538
But you know what's
better than this view?

12:20.574 --> 12:22.273
- [Micah] What's that?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.408
- I'm getting married.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.878
- To the banking golfer?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.046
- Dad.
- I'm sorry.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.914
I meant the golfing banker.
- Dad!

12:31.151 --> 12:32.250
What is that look?

12:33.720 --> 12:38.656
- It's just um, you're,
congratulations.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.024
You're engaged.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.160
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.061
- [Alana] Thank you.

12:43.096 --> 12:43.928
- Oh.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.398
Now, when am I finally
gonna get to meet Evan, huh?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.700
- Good question.
- Mm hm.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.437
(light music)

12:54.174 --> 12:54.973
- Dad?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.211
Where are all the guests?

13:00.247 --> 13:03.982
- Oh, actually you know I'm
not hosting guests right now.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.150
- What, why not?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.351
- Oh, the inn needs
some fixing up,

13:06.386 --> 13:07.652
so I had to close her down.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.487
- And how long will
the fixing up take?

13:10.524 --> 13:11.823
- Well, a couple of weeks.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.825
But the procrastination
has taken years.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.426
- You shutdown the inn?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.428
When and why didn't you tell me?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.229
- Well what's to tell?

13:18.265 --> 13:19.230
This is good news.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.834
I mean, now I have a six
month vacation twice a year.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.671
I have turned my
vocation into a vacation.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.407
No?

13:30.577 --> 13:31.409
Look, honey.

13:32.879 --> 13:35.346
I'm sorry, I mean
I guess like you,

13:35.382 --> 13:37.916
I just wanted to
tell you in person.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.055
Now let's get you all
settled in, right up there.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.225
- I get the Treehouse Suite?

13:47.260 --> 13:50.361
- Of course you get it, you're
the guest of honor here.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.096
- But I'm not a
guest, I'm family.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.731
- [Micah] Oh, come
on, get up there.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.038
So, I just wanna give
you a little warning.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.406
- Oh, no.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.474
- No, no, no, it's
good, it's just,

14:03.510 --> 14:04.909
there's some things, um.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.946
Yeah, uh, just a
little heads up,

14:07.981 --> 14:11.583
the Treehouse Suite might
not be so sweet anymore.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.253
- A little TLC wouldn't hurt.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.955
- Ah, yeah, just a little bit.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.924
So, what do you wanna do
for the rest of the day?

14:19.960 --> 14:20.859
- Lounge on the beach with some

14:20.894 --> 14:22.393
of your mango lemonade
sounds good to me.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.962
- Check.
- Oh, but first,

14:23.997 --> 14:26.064
I have a couple of
phone calls to make.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.498
Except I don't have any service.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.168
- Oh you know you only
get service on the beach.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.669
- It's fine, I'll
send some emails.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.838
- Yeah, unfortunately,
um, you know,

14:33.874 --> 14:35.306
you're gonna laugh at this.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.275
Uh, yeah, the internet's
been down a while.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.409
- What's a while?

14:38.445 --> 14:39.277
- What's today?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.779
- Okay, I know where
this joke is going.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.281
Today is Friday,
so let me guess.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.316
Internet's been down for a year?

14:45.352 --> 14:47.719
- All part of my ploy to
get you to come visit,

14:48.622 --> 14:50.722
and look, it finally worked.

14:51.892 --> 14:52.891
You need to unpack.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.593
Great to have you.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.797
(sea birds cawing)

15:01.801 --> 15:03.968
- Evan, can you hear me?

15:05.472 --> 15:07.038
Evan.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.173
(scoffs)

15:13.480 --> 15:14.312
Evan?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.649
Evan, can you hear me?

15:17.684 --> 15:18.516
Ah!

15:24.024 --> 15:24.956
(chuckling)

15:24.991 --> 15:28.927
- [Kai] Let me help you up.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.532
- Thank you.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.034
- No problem.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.502
Little piece of advice.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.104
Instead of looking at
that, try looking at that.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.009
- Thank you, but I think
I've got it covered.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.313
- You know, the sun'll
be setting soon.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.647
You don't get that in Chicago.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.549
- You know, the sun
also sets in Chicago.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.650
- Yeah, but not like here.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.819
And the weather there, oh.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.688
I saw you guys had
a brutal winter.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.189
- I didn't mind.

15:58.224 --> 15:59.390
Snow is beautiful.

15:59.426 --> 16:04.262
- It is, I love looking at
it, on Facebook, from Florida.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.164
- Don't you ever
wanna leave here?

16:06.199 --> 16:07.832
Live somewhere with seasons?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.000
- We have seasons.

16:09.035 --> 16:12.170
Pollen, summer,
hurricane, football.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.073
And don't forget, I
did leave here once.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.109
I moved to Chicago
to be with you,

16:18.144 --> 16:19.744
and we both know how that ended.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.514
- Well, it all worked
out for the best, right?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.183
We're both happy.
- Oh, I'm happy.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.086
- Of course you are, you get
to play in the water all day.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.888
- You'd be surprised to learn
I do a couple other things.

16:30.924 --> 16:33.624
- Like work on your tan?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.960
- Better than a
computer screen tan.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.462
But if you're happy, then good.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.597
- Then good, 'cause I am happy.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.498
- Then good.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.703
- I am happy.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.206
- There's nothing
like saying it twice

16:48.241 --> 16:49.474
to convince me that it's true.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.275
- I'll let you know
I love my life.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.977
- Good friends?
- The best.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.112
- And how's the app going?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.380
- Amazingly.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.314
- And your boyfriend,
whatever his name is?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.782
- We're actually engaged.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.220
- Congratulations.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.390
Where's the ring?

17:07.994 --> 17:08.860
What, no ring?

17:10.997 --> 17:11.896
- Goodbye, Kai.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.381
(sighing)

17:34.287 --> 17:35.119
Hey, Dad.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.255
- Hey.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.091
So how was the beach?

17:40.126 --> 17:41.559
- I bumped into Kai.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.029
Again.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.597
Was Safety Harbor
always this small?

17:46.633 --> 17:47.999
- Nothing makes
anything feel small

17:48.034 --> 17:50.001
as trying to avoid your ex.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.770
(chuckling)

17:52.806 --> 17:55.073
So maybe it's time to
stop trying to avoid him.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.276
You guys were best friends
your entire childhood.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.478
I mean, I don't know,
don't you think you

18:00.513 --> 18:02.380
could be friends again someday?

18:02.415 --> 18:05.650
- Maybe someday, but off
our interaction, not today.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.887
- Maybe it's just too
much computer time.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.489
- Dad, it's work.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.825
- Work and life is a
delicate balance, honey.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.963
So, did Kai tell you
what he's been up to?

18:20.333 --> 18:21.799
- Sorry, Dad.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.067
I know we never got to lemonade,

18:23.103 --> 18:25.136
but rain check for tomorrow?

18:26.172 --> 18:26.971
- Definitely.

18:28.174 --> 18:31.876
Now you go to bed, an
actual bed, please.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.711
Try to work all night.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.780
Good night.
- Good night.

18:37.016 --> 18:42.019
- Um, and honey, I
am actually happy

18:42.889 --> 18:43.855
for you about your engagement.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.691
I just wanna finally meet Evan.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.660
- He really wants
to meet you too.

18:51.865 --> 18:52.964
- Good night.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.200
Stay off your computer.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.215
(waves crashing)

19:18.558 --> 19:19.590
- Good morning.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.725
I fixed the internet.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.594
- What, how?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.930
- By unplugging the modem
and plugging it back in.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.899
- Oh, you're a genius.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.634
- And then I realized I
forgot some toiletries,

19:29.669 --> 19:32.770
so I went to town and on my
way back I saw a flamingo.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.372
I miss that, just
randomly seeing

19:34.407 --> 19:36.207
a flamingo in the
middle of the road.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.542
We just stared at each other,

19:37.577 --> 19:39.744
trying to decide who
should pass by first.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.079
- I hope one of you
finally put your foot down.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.883
(laughing)

19:49.255 --> 19:51.622
- Hey, Dad, how
are you affording

19:51.658 --> 19:54.058
to stay afloat
without the inn open?

19:54.093 --> 19:56.894
- Yeah, you know, I've been
saving for a rainy day.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.096
Yeah I mean, but there have
been a lot of rainy days

19:59.132 --> 20:02.333
in a row and now I'm,
you know, I mean,

20:02.368 --> 20:06.237
I do have funds to spruce up
the place a little bit, but um,

20:07.340 --> 20:08.506
really, you know
what, I don't know.

20:08.541 --> 20:13.544
I just think it's best that,
honey, I'm thinking of selling.

20:14.280 --> 20:14.745
- Selling the inn?

20:15.949 --> 20:21.118
You love hosting guests and
this is your home, our home.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.987
- I know.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.423
And I also know that
you've always said

20:25.458 --> 20:27.592
you wanna get married
here like Mom and I.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.661
Honey if that's
something you still want,

20:30.697 --> 20:33.364
I mean we'll wait to put
the inn on the market.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.298
I promise you that.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.968
- Well, I'll have to
talk to Evan about that,

20:37.003 --> 20:40.605
but whether we decide to get
married here or you decide

20:40.640 --> 20:44.275
to sell, the inn still
needs to be in shape, right?

20:44.310 --> 20:45.610
So why don't we get started on

20:45.645 --> 20:47.478
the sprucing up and
take it from there?

20:47.513 --> 20:48.980
Okay, fixing up the inn.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.349
We need a to-do list,
a schedule, a budget,

20:51.384 --> 20:53.484
and Dad, I know you have
money set aside for this,

20:53.519 --> 20:54.452
but I'd like to contribute.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.120
- Okay, honey, that is
very sweet, but no--

20:56.155 --> 20:57.888
- Well we can discuss it later.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.457
Okay, what should we do first?

20:59.492 --> 21:03.094
A fresh coat of paint, new
flower boxes, landscaping?

21:04.330 --> 21:05.496
Definitely furniture.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.731
- You know what we
should do first?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.466
Is relax.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.834
Second, coffee.

21:09.869 --> 21:10.868
- Yes.
- For me.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.972
You've clearly had enough.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.908
- We should head to town,
stop by the hardware store,

21:17.944 --> 21:20.244
then the flower shop,
then Mel's furniture shop.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.412
- Hey, good morning.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.081
- Good morning, I brought you
some oranges from my tree.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.850
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.051
- [Leah] What are you two up to?

21:27.086 --> 21:30.554
- Well, by the precision
scheduling I'd say
a rocket launch.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.056
I'll grab your coffee.
- Really?

21:32.091 --> 21:32.957
Thanks.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.893
So, is it good to be home?

21:36.863 --> 21:38.362
- I mean, look at this view.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.398
But I'm sure you know it well.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.266
My dad says you're
from around here.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.702
- Uh, yeah, I grew up in
a little town like this,

21:44.737 --> 21:46.504
but on the Atlantic side.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.607
And my whole childhood I
dreamt of moving to a big city.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.908
- Oh, I get that.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.911
- So, as soon as I could
I left for New York,

21:53.946 --> 21:57.782
law school, then property
law, then too much work.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.417
- I definitely get that.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.852
- And I kept coming back home.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.255
So sad when it was time leave.

22:04.290 --> 22:07.525
But telling myself that
this wasn't the real world,

22:07.560 --> 22:09.126
this wasn't real life.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.262
It was a vacation.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.030
- So what happened?

22:13.066 --> 22:17.768
- Um, I was overworked,
had my heart broken,

22:17.804 --> 22:20.237
and missing my
family and somewhere

22:20.273 --> 22:23.307
in there my definition
of real changed.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.576
- So you just gave it
all up and moved home?

22:26.913 --> 22:29.380
- I didn't feel like giving
anything up, but yeah.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.149
Safety Harbor is special.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.251
It helped heal my heart.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.822
- [Micah] Here you go.

22:37.857 --> 22:38.756
- Oh, thank you.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.757
- [Micah] Yeah, yeah.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.126
- Uh, I've gotta get
back to the restaurant,

22:42.161 --> 22:43.461
but come by later?

22:43.496 --> 22:44.628
- Yeah, sounds great.
- Absolutely.

22:44.664 --> 22:45.563
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Bye.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.397
- Okay, bye.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.900
- Does Leah come
over every morning?

22:51.104 --> 22:52.303
- No, sometimes
I go to her place

22:52.338 --> 22:54.638
and then we read the
paper and do yoga.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.806
- Yoga?

22:55.842 --> 22:57.475
- Yeah, yoga, what, what?

22:58.511 --> 22:59.410
- Nothing.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.579
(phone ringing)
- Nothing?

23:01.614 --> 23:02.480
- Oh, it's Evan.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.581
- [Micah] Oh, okay, okay.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.749
- Wanna talk to him?

23:04.784 --> 23:06.417
- Yes, of course I do.
- Okay.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.253
Hey, Evan, guess who's here?

23:09.288 --> 23:13.624
- Evan, nice to kind of
meet you finally, hear you.

23:13.659 --> 23:14.925
- You too, sir.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.761
- Sir was not even my
father, call me Micah,

23:16.796 --> 23:19.263
and I hope to actually meet
you in person someday soon.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.431
- I'd like that.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.433
I'm sorry I didn't get to see
you when you were in town.

23:22.468 --> 23:23.601
- Oh, me too.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.369
Congratulations.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.704
- [Evan] Thank you.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.772
- Okay, I'm gonna go get ready.

23:27.807 --> 23:28.439
- Okay, okay.

23:30.143 --> 23:31.876
- [Evan] So, your Dad's happy?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.310
- Oh, he's over the moon.

23:33.346 --> 23:34.812
He loves having me here.

23:34.847 --> 23:37.281
- That's great, although I
meant about our engagement.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.550
- Oh, he's so happy.

23:39.585 --> 23:43.821
And actually about the wedding,
there is lots to discuss

23:43.856 --> 23:46.824
about the wedding, but I should
go, we're heading to town.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.159
- Okay.
- I'll talk to you later.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.428
- It was good to talk to you.
- All right, bye.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.237
- How have I not been nice--
- Sam's right there.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.539
- [Micah] What?

24:03.609 --> 24:05.543
- Hey.
- I trust you, but you got--

24:05.578 --> 24:06.744
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.245
- I still can't
believe you're back.

24:08.281 --> 24:11.649
- Well, actually, there
is a reason why I'm back.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.350
And I wanted to
tell you in person.

24:13.386 --> 24:14.385
- Okay.

24:14.420 --> 24:16.086
- I'm getting engaged.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.521
- To the banking golfer?

24:17.557 --> 24:19.323
- Sam, it's golfing banker.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.491
- Oh.
- Dad.

24:20.526 --> 24:22.326
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

24:22.361 --> 24:23.160
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy for you.

24:23.196 --> 24:24.195
- So where's the ring?

24:25.131 --> 24:27.832
- Uh, it's getting resized.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.333
- Oh.

24:29.368 --> 24:30.734
- How are you two, how's
the planning coming along?

24:30.770 --> 24:31.669
- Yeah, what's happening,
what's happening?

24:31.704 --> 24:32.603
- It's incredibly stressful.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.737
- Yeah, we just lost our venue.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.005
- I'm sorry to hear.
- Oh, sorry.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.173
- I mean, we don't
know what to do.

24:36.209 --> 24:37.842
- You know how important
the festival is.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.777
Not just the business
that it brings to town,

24:39.812 --> 24:41.011
but it means to everyone.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.746
- So how can we help, hm?

24:42.782 --> 24:44.248
- You can find us a new venue.

24:44.283 --> 24:47.051
- Short of working miracles,
how else can we help?

24:47.086 --> 24:49.420
- Thanks but, we'll
figure it out.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.688
- Hopefully.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.223
- Okay, if you need
anything before I leave,

24:52.258 --> 24:53.858
please let me know.
- Awesome, thank you.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.292
- All right, well,
good to see you.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.293
- All right, okay.
- See you later, bye.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.728
- See ya.
- See ya.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.533
Should I get this one?

25:02.568 --> 25:04.702
Whoa, think they liked it?

25:04.737 --> 25:05.736
- Thank you.

25:06.672 --> 25:07.538
- [Kai] Hey.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.711
- Just make yourself
comfortable.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.112
- Thanks, I will.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.714
So, you're getting married.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.449
- Right to it I guess.

25:18.484 --> 25:19.583
I am.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.985
- And how did you two meet?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.453
- Through my app.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.321
- Oh, Closer works, wow.

25:24.357 --> 25:27.057
- Despite your obvious
doubt, it does work.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.127
It matches compatible
people in close proximity,

25:30.162 --> 25:31.395
like me and Evan.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.897
- So you found the
love of your life,

25:32.932 --> 25:35.399
or did you find the
love of your zip code?

25:37.703 --> 25:38.936
- The point of Closer is that

25:38.971 --> 25:41.405
it limits impractical
outcomes like say--

25:41.440 --> 25:42.940
- Long distance relationships.

25:44.610 --> 25:45.709
- Exactly.

25:45.778 --> 25:48.579
- You know long distance
relationships aren't all bad.

25:48.614 --> 25:52.349
The love letters, the
care packages, the visits.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.751
There's a plus side.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.487
- A very impractical plus side.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.292
(Kai sighs)

26:01.327 --> 26:03.761
- So I guess that's
why you're here,

26:03.796 --> 26:05.996
to plan your wedding at the inn?

26:06.032 --> 26:07.264
- Why would you think that?

26:07.300 --> 26:08.999
- [Kai] That was
always your dream.

26:11.470 --> 26:12.303
- It was.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.473
But now my Dad's talking
about selling the inn and.

26:19.979 --> 26:20.978
You already knew?

26:22.715 --> 26:25.616
I know it's been hard for
my dad without my mom,

26:25.651 --> 26:27.785
but running the
inn is who he is.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.286
And I think if he would
just see it filled

26:29.322 --> 26:31.288
with people and life again.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.626
- Kai.

26:35.661 --> 26:36.493
When are we hittin'
the water, man?

26:36.529 --> 26:37.962
- Hey, I'm gonna run.

26:37.997 --> 26:38.963
- [Micah] Oh, we gotta
hit the surf soon, buddy.

26:38.998 --> 26:39.964
- Yeah, I'll see you soon.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.031
- All right.
- Cheers.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.302
- Dad, I have an idea.

26:45.338 --> 26:46.971
- Why am I afraid
to ask what it is?

26:47.006 --> 26:48.973
- You can host the orchid
festival at the inn.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.208
It'll be the perfect venue.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.644
- Honey, I would love to help,
but the inn needs fixing up

26:53.679 --> 26:55.579
and the festival is
in, what, eight days.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.181
- That's enough time to finish.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.517
- I guess, I mean I guess it is.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.888
I mean, if I had some help.

27:06.359 --> 27:08.325
- Ah.
- Ah, yeah.

27:08.361 --> 27:11.729
So how about, I'll
host the festival

27:11.764 --> 27:12.997
if you stay and help me.

27:13.032 --> 27:13.931
- Dad, I can't stay
another week, I--

27:13.966 --> 27:15.499
- And I can't do it alone.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.534
- Are you guilting me
into staying longer?

27:17.570 --> 27:21.438
- No, I'm not guilting
you, I'm bribing you.

27:21.474 --> 27:22.339
- Okay.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.211
If I stay, can we go to the
floating lantern ceremony?

27:30.149 --> 27:31.882
When was the last time you went?

27:31.917 --> 27:34.251
- Um, with you and mom.

27:37.223 --> 27:40.691
So, what do you
say to staying, hm?

27:43.763 --> 27:47.498
- I say that if we're gonna
get everything done in time,

27:48.734 --> 27:50.467
we better take our food to go.

27:50.503 --> 27:51.568
- To go it is.
- To go?

27:51.604 --> 27:56.907
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go.

27:56.909 --> 28:00.044
- So I'm gonna stay another
week through the festival,

28:00.079 --> 28:01.378
which means I get to be here

28:01.414 --> 28:03.714
for the floating
lantern ceremony.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.249
- [Evan] Floating
lantern ceremony?

28:05.284 --> 28:07.751
- Safety Harbor has a
tradition of floating lanterns

28:07.787 --> 28:10.721
to celebrate our loved
ones, living and past.

28:10.756 --> 28:12.656
- That's beautiful.
- It is.

28:12.692 --> 28:16.260
I used to float a lantern
every year with my parents.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.762
But my dad hasn't done
it since my mom passed.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.964
I think it could
be good for him.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.499
- That's sweet.

28:22.535 --> 28:25.569
Look, I'm happy that you're
there, but I wish I was too.

28:25.604 --> 28:26.837
- Me too.

28:26.872 --> 28:27.771
- [Evan] I'll talk to you later.

28:27.807 --> 28:30.274
- Okay, all right, bye.

28:39.652 --> 28:40.784
- What, you're already at it?

28:40.853 --> 28:43.821
- Early bird gets a jump start
on the crushing deadline.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.289
I just finished
prepping for painting

28:45.324 --> 28:47.458
and I think tomorrow we
should go to the flower shop.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.692
- And how do you know
how to do all this?

28:48.728 --> 28:50.627
- You and mom taught
me a thing or two.

28:50.663 --> 28:52.429
- Yeah, like how to
hire a professional.

28:52.465 --> 28:53.931
- [Leah] Good morning.

28:53.966 --> 28:54.832
- Good morning.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.433
- Wow, you two look busy.

28:56.469 --> 28:58.635
- Yeah.
- Well, I am here.

28:58.671 --> 28:59.503
Put me to work.

29:00.473 --> 29:02.106
- Leah, you're so busy
with your restaurant,

29:02.141 --> 29:04.274
it's not necessary.
- Oh, but I wanna help.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.909
- Well you can take over for me.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.215
- How about you
two work together.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.383
You can start
painting the doors.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.351
- Sounds good.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.954
- Great, yeah.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.055
Wanna paint, wanna roll?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.790
- [Leah] I think I'll roll.

29:19.825 --> 29:22.159
- I heard you're
under construction.

29:22.194 --> 29:22.793
How can I help?

29:23.929 --> 29:25.395
- Thank you, but we're fine.

29:25.431 --> 29:26.864
- We'd love your help.

29:26.899 --> 29:30.434
You know, in fact, you could
team up with um, Alana.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.705
- Great.

29:34.740 --> 29:35.606
- Great.

29:39.545 --> 29:42.312
Is there something going
on between my dad and Leah?

29:42.348 --> 29:44.014
- No, they're just friends.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.650
- They'd be a perfect couple.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.485
Why haven't they
gotten together?

29:48.521 --> 29:49.686
- I guess because they haven't

29:49.722 --> 29:52.089
had match maker Alana
around to meddle.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.957
- Lucky for them, now they do.

29:57.530 --> 30:00.731
And Kai, it's really
nice of you to help.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.866
- Of course, anything
for your dad.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.169
And when my parents
moved to Vermont,

30:05.204 --> 30:06.737
he's the only
family I have here.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.705
- I can't believe your
parents moved to Vermont.

30:08.741 --> 30:10.073
- I know, isn't it the law that

30:10.109 --> 30:11.842
you have to retire in Florida?

30:11.877 --> 30:12.876
- Might as well be.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.015
- Hey, Alana?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.550
I know what you're doing.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.518
You're hoping that
hosting the festival

30:21.554 --> 30:24.054
will inspire your dad
to reopen the inn.

30:25.090 --> 30:25.923
- I am.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.059
I just can't imagine
him selling the inn.

30:29.094 --> 30:31.695
- And he'd never say
this, but he misses it.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.532
So, I wanna help, however I can.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.735
- Thank you,
there's a ton to do.

30:38.771 --> 30:40.704
Flowers, landscaping, furniture.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.439
We could divide and conquer.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.908
- Or, we could work together.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.045
We used to be friends.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.246
We can be friends again.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.052
- This should dry before
adding another coat.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.154
- So, what's next?

30:57.189 --> 30:58.488
- I was gonna head
to the flower shop,

30:58.524 --> 30:59.790
start on the landscaping.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.427
- I think the flower
shop is closed by now.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.163
- Then I should
probably get to work.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.297
Closer needs some new code.

31:07.333 --> 31:10.067
- Or we could do something fun.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.568
Go kayaking?

31:11.604 --> 31:13.570
When was the last time
you went on the water?

31:13.606 --> 31:14.371
- It's been a while.

31:15.941 --> 31:17.574
Uh, but I don't
think I'm up for it.

31:17.610 --> 31:18.442
- Okay.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.811
What about a walk?

31:20.846 --> 31:22.246
The pier?

31:22.281 --> 31:24.281
You can't come home
without going to the pier.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.817
(light music)

31:38.964 --> 31:42.966
- I feel like I've been so
wrapped up in the inn and me,

31:43.002 --> 31:44.301
I haven't asked about you.

31:45.638 --> 31:46.470
What's going on?

31:47.573 --> 31:49.573
Are you still making
custom kayaks?

31:51.010 --> 31:54.611
- So the last you heard about
me was from eight years ago?

31:54.647 --> 31:56.280
- After the breakup,
I might have asked

31:56.315 --> 31:57.848
for news about Kai blackout.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.317
- But the embargo is up.

32:01.820 --> 32:02.986
- So you still making kayaks?

32:04.823 --> 32:09.293
- Yeah, I am and paddle boards
and soon kite surfing boards.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.627
- That's awesome.

32:10.663 --> 32:13.463
You make those in
your garage or?

32:13.499 --> 32:15.332
- Um, I have a space.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.000
- Oh, and you sell them?

32:17.036 --> 32:18.568
- I make a living.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.371
- Congratulations,
I'm happy for you.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.839
- Thank you.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.808
I'm happy for you too.

32:24.843 --> 32:26.510
Got what you always wanted.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.312
Big city, a fiancee.

32:32.184 --> 32:35.319
- And you, have a girlfriend?

32:35.354 --> 32:38.155
- Oh, not really.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.024
I was seeing someone
but, didn't work out.

32:42.227 --> 32:47.164
And to be honest,
um, I'm on your app.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.066
(laughing)

32:49.101 --> 32:50.901
- Wait, you're on my app?
- Mm hm.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.005
- And you haven't found the
love of your zip code yet?

32:55.040 --> 32:56.740
- I guess I'm not
as lucky as you.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.651
So, what's your fiancee like?

33:09.121 --> 33:11.021
- He's great.

33:11.056 --> 33:13.190
He's kind and smart.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.725
We have a lot of fun together.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.095
- Are you madly, crazy
in love with him?

33:19.064 --> 33:20.697
- Do I have to be mad or crazy

33:20.733 --> 33:23.467
for it to be a
good relationship?

33:23.502 --> 33:26.303
- Depends on what you want.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.372
- All I wanted was a
love like my parents had,

33:28.407 --> 33:30.407
and then I thought I
had found it with...

33:35.414 --> 33:40.250
I don't want to be mad or
crazy, I just wanna be happy.

33:41.086 --> 33:43.420
- But, are you happy?

33:48.994 --> 33:51.728
- Yes, I am.

33:51.764 --> 33:54.498
Being happy doesn't mean
that everything is perfect.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.567
It means that you've decided
to look past the imperfections.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.442
Is that salt water
taffy place still open?

34:06.612 --> 34:08.111
- Took you long enough to ask.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.080
I'll race you there.

34:10.115 --> 34:11.748
- I'm not gonna race you.

34:11.784 --> 34:12.849
- Oh, you.

34:12.885 --> 34:15.252
(chuckling)

34:18.023 --> 34:20.657
- Tell me, Renee.

34:20.692 --> 34:23.727
- Nothing official, but
you know my roommate's

34:23.762 --> 34:26.229
best friend's brother
works at Atlas Capital.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.765
Well, he heard there's
a deal in the works.

34:28.801 --> 34:29.900
- A deal?

34:29.935 --> 34:31.101
What kind of a deal?

34:31.136 --> 34:33.937
- To fund Closer going national.

34:33.972 --> 34:37.374
- Oh, my God, that's,
that's amazing.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.942
But, nothing's official.

34:38.977 --> 34:40.343
It could all be hearsay.

34:40.379 --> 34:43.013
- Even if it is, it's
the best hearsay ever.

34:43.048 --> 34:46.283
He said the CEO loved your
story about finding Evan on

34:46.318 --> 34:49.953
Closer and news of
your engagement is
only going to help us.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.688
It's all happening.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.924
- Hopefully, because
as much as I'm sure

34:53.959 --> 34:56.026
you're roommate's best
friend's brother's hearsay

34:56.061 --> 34:58.829
is valid, nothing's certain yet.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.432
I should get back to
these renovations.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.633
I'll talk to you later.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.403
- They are super.
- I noticed, and new.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.704
They're new.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.039
Oh, let me get that.
- Here, move aside.

35:09.074 --> 35:11.374
(laughing)

35:11.410 --> 35:13.810
- No, I can take it.

35:13.846 --> 35:15.212
You're gonna save me
from my daughter--

35:15.247 --> 35:17.080
- [Alana] Hey.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.048
- Hey.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.082
- How's it going over here?

35:19.118 --> 35:20.016
- It's going, we're good.

35:20.052 --> 35:22.486
Yeah, and in fact,
you know, we're great.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.420
It's going great.

35:24.756 --> 35:25.722
- Cool.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.391
So Dad, did you speak to
Mel about the furniture.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.092
- Yeah, his shop
is closed today.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.627
So I'm gonna stop by tomorrow.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.162
- Okay, perfect.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.964
In the meantime, should we
start on the landscaping?

35:33.999 --> 35:36.066
Why don't we finish up and head
to town to the flower shop?

35:36.101 --> 35:38.235
- I'd love to, but I've gotta
get back to the restaurant.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.569
- Yeah, and Sam and James, they
wanna discuss the festival,

35:39.605 --> 35:42.572
so I was just gonna
catch a ride with Leah.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.242
(bell dinging)

35:46.211 --> 35:47.577
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

35:47.613 --> 35:48.745
I had something to do at work.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.580
- No worries, I was just
gonna head to the flower shop.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.082
- Oh, I'll come with.

35:52.117 --> 35:54.317
- Great, I'll get my car keys.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.653
- You know, the
flower shop delivers.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.656
(bell dinging)

35:59.691 --> 36:02.392
(playful music)

36:12.137 --> 36:14.804

36:27.719 --> 36:30.120
- You know the last time I
rode a bike was with you.

36:30.155 --> 36:32.389
- Well, remember that time
that you swung your leg off

36:32.424 --> 36:35.025
the branch and you
almost broke your leg?

36:35.060 --> 36:37.627
- Wait, yeah, you mean
when you dared me to?

36:37.663 --> 36:39.696
- I did not, I told you not to.

36:39.731 --> 36:40.997
- No you didn't.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.499
And then a horsefly the size of

36:42.534 --> 36:45.302
a golf ball was
chasing me around.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.836
(laughing)

36:46.872 --> 36:48.672
- I was rooting
for that horsefly.

36:51.910 --> 36:56.379
♪ You played me,

36:56.415 --> 36:57.814

36:57.849 --> 37:00.150
It's gonna be a lot of flowers.

37:00.185 --> 37:01.651
- I was gonna talk to
your dad about this,

37:01.687 --> 37:03.653
but I'd like to chip in.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.655
- [Alana] Oh, that's
generous, but not necessary.

37:05.691 --> 37:08.825
- You know, the inn
is my second home.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.760
I basically grew up there.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.162
Let me help.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.898
- That's really sweet, but no.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.736
These were my mom's favorite.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.671
She used to grow them.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.740
- She had such a green thumb.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.675
- Oh, it's not hereditary.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.344
Seems like I only
own the house plants

37:27.379 --> 37:28.845
that have no will to live.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.147
(laughing)

37:32.818 --> 37:35.385
My mom used to say
orchids are like love.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.923
They grow easily, bloom
in most conditions.

37:39.958 --> 37:40.924
- And live forever.

37:42.661 --> 37:45.895
(light dramatic music)

37:48.767 --> 37:49.599
Here.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.770
This'll look pretty
in your hair.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.754
(giggling)

38:10.789 --> 38:11.721
- Sorry, excuse me.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.723
- Shiny chrome.

38:13.759 --> 38:16.293
- Mr. Kayak, you got a
minute, I need to talk shop.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.331
- He sells my kayaks there.

38:21.366 --> 38:22.432
- That's awesome.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.035
Well, go.
- Okay.

38:26.271 --> 38:27.937
- I'll wait for you here.

38:29.274 --> 38:30.273
- All right.

38:32.044 --> 38:34.477
- Excuse me, what's
going on here?

38:35.947 --> 38:38.081
- Kai's just helping me with
the renovations for the inn.

38:38.116 --> 38:38.948
- Oh.

38:39.951 --> 38:40.984
- Stop.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.585
Look, we used to be best friends

38:42.621 --> 38:44.621
and now we're trying
to be friends again.

38:50.128 --> 38:52.595
It's cool that Kai's doing
what he loves for a living.

38:52.631 --> 38:53.930
- Wait, he told you?

38:53.965 --> 38:55.598
- Yeah, of course.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.100
- Good.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.335
For a while, I know you
didn't wanna know anything

38:58.370 --> 38:59.302
about him, but it
started to feel

38:59.338 --> 39:00.870
like you were the last
person on Earth to know.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.972
- What do you mean?
- Alana?

39:05.911 --> 39:06.776
- Beth?

39:08.647 --> 39:10.113
- You're home and
haven't stopped by

39:10.148 --> 39:11.848
to see me at the bakery yet?

39:11.883 --> 39:14.951
- Oh, Beth, I
missed you so much.

39:19.324 --> 39:23.793
Mm, I love your key lime pie.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.495
It's the taste of being home.

39:26.665 --> 39:29.165
- You two, you were
always the cutest.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.468
That summer that Kai
helped me out here,

39:31.503 --> 39:35.004
he worked so hard to make you
a chocolate engagement ring.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.240
(laughing)

39:37.275 --> 39:39.409
with a cacao bean.
- Cacao bean.

39:39.444 --> 39:40.910
- [Beth] In place of a diamond.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.746
- And then you tried eating
it instead of wearing it.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.381
- It was melting.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.719
Um, are those?

39:58.563 --> 39:59.763
- I've been getting them ready

39:59.798 --> 40:01.998
for the floating
lantern ceremony.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.199
Are you going to come?

40:04.403 --> 40:05.902
- I want to.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.071
I'm hoping to float
one with my dad.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.174
- I'm not sure if
he's up for it.

40:11.209 --> 40:14.377
- I know, but I'm hoping
that since I'm here.

40:17.048 --> 40:17.881
We'll see.

40:27.492 --> 40:28.391
What?

40:28.427 --> 40:29.893
- Nothing, it's just,

40:31.797 --> 40:32.996
it's been a nice day.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.566
- It's been a really nice day.

40:39.738 --> 40:42.105
I just remember that
I was out sailing.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.473
- [Kai] No surprise.

40:43.508 --> 40:45.208
- It's gonna be like some punch.

40:45.243 --> 40:49.579
- I don't see that happening.
(giggling)

40:53.084 --> 40:54.984
Did your dad book a guest?

40:55.020 --> 40:55.852
- No.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.389
That's Evan.

41:05.096 --> 41:05.929
Hey!

41:07.933 --> 41:08.932
- Surprise!

41:08.967 --> 41:10.467
- What are you doing here?

41:10.502 --> 41:12.802
- Well, you know, I know you
wanted me to meet your dad,

41:12.838 --> 41:13.703
so I thought.

41:14.773 --> 41:15.405
- Wow.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.343
Kai, this is Evan, my fiancee.

41:20.378 --> 41:23.947
Evan, this is Kai,
my childhood friend.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.450
- Nice to meet you, Evan.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.318
- Same.

41:30.622 --> 41:34.924
- I can't believe you're here.
- I'm here.

41:34.960 --> 41:39.929
- I'ma get outta here, I
got a couple things to do.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.297
- Okay, I'll see you later.

41:52.744 --> 41:53.576
- Okay.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.014
- I wanna apologize.

41:58.083 --> 42:01.017
I should have asked you for
Alana's hand before proposing.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.185
- Nah.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.287
- Not quite where that tradition
stands in modern romance.

42:04.322 --> 42:07.290
- Well, it's her hand,
you don't have to ask me.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.659
If Alana's happy, I'm happy.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.628
Because there is no
more important decision

42:11.663 --> 42:14.230
than who you spend
your life with and oh,

42:14.266 --> 42:16.566
did I get lucky in
that department.

42:16.601 --> 42:20.703
Alana's mother was the
absolutele love of my life.

42:20.739 --> 42:23.306
The moment we met, I knew.

42:23.341 --> 42:26.075
We just had this crazy
connection and I don't even know

42:26.111 --> 42:29.379
how to describe it, but sorry,
I just, I could go all day.

42:29.414 --> 42:32.515
So you two met on Alana's app?

42:32.551 --> 42:33.983
- Yeah.
- Yup.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.018
- All right, so let's
bring it back a little bit.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.420
Was it love at first sight?

42:37.455 --> 42:39.822
Was it lightning
bolts, butterflies?

42:39.858 --> 42:42.659
- Actually, it took time.

42:42.694 --> 42:44.427
- Yeah, our first date we
didn't really hit it off.

42:44.462 --> 42:46.229
- [Alana] No, we went golfing.

42:46.264 --> 42:48.431
- And Alana had some
thoughts on my swing.

42:48.466 --> 42:51.834
- It was awkward and you
know, conversation just.

42:51.870 --> 42:53.336
- There was no way
I thought she'd

42:53.371 --> 42:54.404
ever go out with me again.

42:54.439 --> 42:55.538
- No, Renee
convinced me to go on

42:55.574 --> 42:56.372
a second date with him and--

42:56.408 --> 42:57.707
- Thank you, Renee.

42:58.810 --> 43:01.210
- Look, it seems like
it all worked out.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.712
And if you do decide
to get married here,

43:02.747 --> 43:04.347
I'd look forward to hosting.

43:06.051 --> 43:06.883
- Here?

43:10.822 --> 43:13.056
Hey, what your dad was
talking about before,

43:14.492 --> 43:17.226
if you wanna get married
here, I'm happy to do it.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.663
- Thank you, but I
don't know what I want.

43:21.499 --> 43:22.799
When I was young it was my dream

43:22.834 --> 43:24.734
to get married here
like my parents.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.203
Now I'm not so sure.

43:28.239 --> 43:29.038
- Why?

43:29.908 --> 43:30.740
What changed?

43:31.910 --> 43:32.742
- I don't know.

43:33.745 --> 43:36.379
But there's enough time
to discuss the wedding.

43:36.414 --> 43:38.748
For now let's just
enjoy being engaged.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.049
- Yeah, okay.

43:41.152 --> 43:42.018
Speaking of.

43:51.429 --> 43:52.228
- It's beautiful.

43:57.636 --> 43:59.335
- [Evan] So this is
where you grew up?

43:59.371 --> 44:00.570
It's really special.

44:00.605 --> 44:02.905
- It is and I'm
remembering that.

44:04.442 --> 44:06.776
Being back this time I'm
realizing that as much

44:06.811 --> 44:09.579
as I love Chicago, it'll
never feel like home

44:09.614 --> 44:10.747
the way Safety Harbor does.

44:12.450 --> 44:17.286
I wanna visit more and even,
who knows, move back one day.

44:18.890 --> 44:19.789
- Move back here?

44:21.126 --> 44:22.925
Alana, we can't live in Florida.

44:22.961 --> 44:24.093
- Why not?

44:24.129 --> 44:26.596
- Because our lives
are in Chicago.

44:26.631 --> 44:28.131
Our jobs are in Chicago.

44:29.501 --> 44:30.667
What are we supposed to do

44:30.702 --> 44:32.301
just sit around
watching the sunset?

44:33.638 --> 44:35.238
- We could build lives here.

44:36.641 --> 44:38.341
- That just doesn't
seem realistic.

44:45.150 --> 44:46.015
- [Sam] Hey!

44:47.585 --> 44:49.719
- Evan, this is
Sam, my best friend.

44:49.754 --> 44:51.354
Sam, this is my fiancee, Evan.

44:51.389 --> 44:52.055
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:52.090 --> 44:53.556
- I've heard so much about you.

44:53.591 --> 44:54.557
Welcome to Safety Harbor.
- Thanks.

44:54.592 --> 44:56.793
- Are you gonna be here
for the orchid festival

44:56.828 --> 44:57.794
or the lantern ceremony?

44:57.829 --> 44:58.828
- Uh.
- Oh, I didn't ask.

44:58.863 --> 44:59.829
How long are you staying?

44:59.864 --> 45:01.464
- You know, that
is work calling,

45:01.499 --> 45:02.899
which should answer
that question.

45:02.934 --> 45:03.800
Excuse me.

45:04.769 --> 45:05.601
Hello?

45:07.539 --> 45:08.337
- What?

45:08.373 --> 45:09.205
- Nothing.

45:10.575 --> 45:12.675
It's just, it's
actually happening.

45:12.711 --> 45:14.544
You're going to get married.

45:14.579 --> 45:16.546
- Yes.
- And I guess, somehow

45:16.581 --> 45:18.414
always hoped that
you'd end up with--

45:18.450 --> 45:19.515
- Don't say.

45:20.351 --> 45:20.983
- Kai.

45:23.455 --> 45:24.987
I have to go back to the shop.

45:28.727 --> 45:29.892
- How's it going?

45:29.928 --> 45:31.160
- Great.

45:31.196 --> 45:33.529
- No, I don't know,
I gotta, I gotta go.

45:38.737 --> 45:39.702
- Hey, dude.

45:39.738 --> 45:40.903
- Hey.

45:40.939 --> 45:43.005
- I was just showing Evan around
town and then we were gonna

45:43.041 --> 45:44.741
head back to the inn
to start planting.

45:44.776 --> 45:46.843
- Oh, okay.

45:46.878 --> 45:49.011
Cool, I guess you
guys have it covered.

45:49.047 --> 45:51.581
I'm gonna go paddle
boarding anyway.

45:51.616 --> 45:53.116
- Kai's really
into water sports.

45:53.151 --> 45:54.951
- Ah.

45:54.986 --> 45:57.620
- Alana used to be really
into water sports too.

45:57.655 --> 45:58.855
- Really?

45:58.890 --> 45:59.789
I didn't know that.

45:59.824 --> 46:02.191
A lot of new things
I'm learning about you.

46:02.227 --> 46:03.860
- Evan, do you kayak
or paddle board?

46:03.895 --> 46:05.895
- No, but I golf.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.230
Mainly with Alana.

46:09.167 --> 46:10.266
- You golf?

46:10.301 --> 46:11.200
- Yes.

46:11.236 --> 46:13.603
- Golf?
- Yes, golf.

46:13.638 --> 46:15.805
It's like kayaking for people
that don't live by the water.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.408
- But you do live by the water,
so why don't you go kayak?

46:19.444 --> 46:22.245
- I told you, Lake Michigan's
got nothing on the gulf.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.746
- But you're by the gulf now.

46:23.782 --> 46:26.048
So, are you afraid of the water?

46:26.084 --> 46:27.450
It's okay, there are
no more alligators.

46:27.485 --> 46:28.985
The sharks ate 'em.

46:29.020 --> 46:31.254
(laughing)

46:31.289 --> 46:34.290
- Um, we're gonna go
grab a bite at Leah's.

46:35.193 --> 46:36.425
- [Kai] Okay, see ya later.

46:36.461 --> 46:39.729
(light dramatic music)

46:41.633 --> 46:43.966
(Kai sighs)

46:53.478 --> 46:55.511
- Hey, just sit wherever you
want, I'll be right there.

46:55.547 --> 46:56.913
- Thank you.

46:56.948 --> 46:59.415
How about this one.
- Hey, how do you know Kai?

47:00.885 --> 47:02.585
- He was my
childhood best friend

47:04.622 --> 47:06.489
and then we dated
in high school,

47:09.194 --> 47:11.060
and then long
distance in college.

47:12.964 --> 47:14.931
- And then what happened?

47:14.966 --> 47:17.633
- After college he moved
to Chicago for a year.

47:17.669 --> 47:20.436
We tried to make it
work, but it just didn't.

47:20.471 --> 47:21.304
- Why not?

47:23.074 --> 47:25.308
- I think time apart
had changed us.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.777
Or maybe we only worked here.

47:29.814 --> 47:30.947
Then we broke up.

47:30.982 --> 47:33.850
- And then you created a
dating app based on proximity.

47:33.885 --> 47:35.484
- Closer has nothing to do with.

47:36.921 --> 47:40.456
I mean, yes, a long distance
relationship helped me realize

47:40.491 --> 47:42.124
that there are other
factors in a relationship

47:42.160 --> 47:44.327
other than being
madly, crazy in love.

47:44.362 --> 47:45.528
- Like what?

47:45.563 --> 47:47.763
- Like practicality,
like capability.

47:50.001 --> 47:52.969
- So, have you made a decision?

48:04.515 --> 48:07.483
- I think I'm gonna check
in with work for a bit.

48:07.518 --> 48:08.751
- Okay.

48:08.786 --> 48:09.852
- I'll see ya later.

48:15.693 --> 48:16.525
- Hey, honey.

48:18.529 --> 48:19.362
What's wrong?

48:20.565 --> 48:23.366
- A week ago everything seemed
perfect between Evan and I,

48:24.736 --> 48:28.304
and now it's like the engagement
has thrown everything off.

48:30.909 --> 48:31.741
What?

48:33.711 --> 48:38.247
- You know, I think you
wanted it to be perfect, I do.

48:38.283 --> 48:42.184
But to me, based on what I've
seen, I think you two are more

48:44.055 --> 48:46.255
like good friends
than anything else.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.858
- Aren't you supposed to
marry your best friend?

48:48.893 --> 48:50.393
- Yes, you are.

48:53.131 --> 48:57.133
But you're also supposed
to be in love with them.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.769
(somber music)

49:22.360 --> 49:23.759
- [Alana] Hey.

49:23.795 --> 49:24.627
- Hey.

49:26.998 --> 49:27.897
- Can we talk?

49:29.801 --> 49:30.633
- Okay.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.072
This is about Kai.

49:36.107 --> 49:38.607
- No, this is about us.

49:41.279 --> 49:42.111
About me.

49:44.315 --> 49:47.116
I came home and I started
thinking about the wedding

49:47.151 --> 49:48.918
and love and what I used to want

49:48.953 --> 49:53.289
and what I realize I still want.

49:55.293 --> 49:57.893
Evan, in so many ways
we are so good together.

49:59.731 --> 50:00.763
- That isn't enough?

50:04.335 --> 50:05.167
- No.

50:06.804 --> 50:08.270
We deserve to have love.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.107
I deserve to be in love.

50:13.644 --> 50:14.610
And so do you.

50:15.747 --> 50:18.781
And I know you feel it too,
there's something missing.

50:20.184 --> 50:23.686
- There is something missing,
but I didn't wanna admit it.

50:26.491 --> 50:27.590
You're my best friend.

50:28.826 --> 50:30.359
- And we'll still be friends.

50:55.053 --> 50:56.252
- Hey, honey.

50:56.287 --> 50:57.119
How you doin'?

51:00.291 --> 51:02.158
- It was the right
thing to do, right?

51:03.394 --> 51:04.627
- Come on.

51:04.662 --> 51:06.262
Why don't you come have a seat?

51:07.465 --> 51:08.964
Just like we used to, come on.

51:13.971 --> 51:14.804
So?

51:16.974 --> 51:19.642
- Growing up I saw you
and mom so in love.

51:20.478 --> 51:22.778
And I wanted a love like that.

51:22.814 --> 51:24.447
And then I thought I
had found it with Kai,

51:24.482 --> 51:25.815
and it broke my
heart and it made me

51:25.850 --> 51:27.283
think it was just a fairytale.

51:27.318 --> 51:28.317
- But it's not.

51:28.352 --> 51:29.618
It's not a fairytale.

51:29.654 --> 51:30.886
- Maybe it is.

51:30.922 --> 51:31.821
- Honey, it--

51:31.856 --> 51:32.988
- I had it and I lost it.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.125
- You had it and you lost it.

51:37.595 --> 51:40.096
- Maybe it's not
sustainable, not realistic.

51:41.365 --> 51:43.466
But that doesn't make
me want it any less.

51:44.602 --> 51:46.902
- Good.
- And that's the hard part.

51:46.938 --> 51:49.205
I tell myself to be
practical, but...

51:51.943 --> 51:53.542
I still wanna love like that.

51:55.079 --> 51:56.145
- I know you do.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.646
- And I'm not asking for a lot,

51:57.682 --> 52:01.650
just a soulmate to spend
the rest of my life with.

52:01.686 --> 52:02.518
- That's all?

52:06.023 --> 52:07.423
- I know you're
supposed to stop wanting

52:07.458 --> 52:10.392
the thing you want most
and then you'll find it.

52:10.428 --> 52:12.428
But that just doesn't
make any sense.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.295
- No.

52:14.432 --> 52:16.665
But you do know the
old dadage, right?

52:16.701 --> 52:17.566
- The dadage?

52:17.602 --> 52:19.034
- Oh, yeah.

52:19.070 --> 52:20.936
You will find the love
when you least expect it,

52:20.972 --> 52:22.671
like when your ex-fiancee
leaves Florida.

52:22.707 --> 52:25.007
- That's an incredibly
specific adage.

52:25.042 --> 52:28.010
- Was it?

52:28.045 --> 52:29.745
- But, whether it's true or not,

52:30.781 --> 52:33.082
it's hard during heartbreak.

52:33.117 --> 52:33.983
- I know.

52:35.219 --> 52:36.051
Hey, hey.

52:38.556 --> 52:40.789
You will have the love
you always wanted.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.057
- How do you know?

52:42.093 --> 52:44.093
- I know, dad's
know these things.

52:45.563 --> 52:49.098
And as for heartbreak,
what did I always tell you

52:49.133 --> 52:50.733
when you were a
little girl, huh?

52:53.404 --> 52:57.773
No rain, no rainbows.
- No rainbows.

52:57.808 --> 52:59.108
- That's right.

52:59.143 --> 53:00.376
Get in here, you.

53:00.411 --> 53:01.677
Ah, I love you.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.046
Oh, we got this.

53:05.516 --> 53:08.884
And now, you are gonna
take the day off, right?

53:08.920 --> 53:09.818
- No.
- What?

53:09.854 --> 53:12.121
- As much as a pity
party sounds appealing,

53:12.156 --> 53:13.923
the festival's in four days.

53:13.958 --> 53:15.424
- You're right, four
days, so you got.

53:15.459 --> 53:18.027
- No, I just need some time
and I'll meet you outside.

53:18.963 --> 53:20.229
- Two minutes.

53:20.264 --> 53:21.130
- Five.

53:21.165 --> 53:22.031
- Three.

53:22.967 --> 53:24.733
Oh, I love you, baby.

53:32.109 --> 53:34.777
(phone ringing)

53:41.185 --> 53:42.318
- Hey.

53:42.353 --> 53:43.953
- Hey, it's me.

53:43.988 --> 53:45.688
Just wanted to check in on you.

53:45.723 --> 53:46.956
- That's sweet, thank you.

53:46.991 --> 53:48.991
I'm just keeping busy.

53:49.026 --> 53:51.694
- Well, I have some news
that might distract you.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.596
- I could use some good news.

53:53.631 --> 53:55.798
- Atlas just called
and they're in.

53:55.833 --> 53:57.132
They're sending over a deal.

53:57.168 --> 53:59.435
They love Closer,
loved our pitch.

53:59.470 --> 54:01.337
- And loved how I
met Evan on the app.

54:02.640 --> 54:05.541
Sorry, yes, this is great news.

54:05.576 --> 54:07.276
- Check your email for the deal.

54:07.311 --> 54:09.778
They wanna get
started immediately.

54:09.814 --> 54:10.646
- Okay.

54:12.049 --> 54:15.284
- Alana, this is everything
we've been working for.

54:15.319 --> 54:16.719
This is amazing.

54:16.754 --> 54:19.021
- I know it is, it's amazing.

54:20.925 --> 54:22.324
I'll talk to you later, bye.

54:36.841 --> 54:38.474
- Oh hey, what's going on?

54:41.512 --> 54:42.344
- I have some news.

54:42.380 --> 54:43.979
- [Micah] Ut oh, okay.

54:45.383 --> 54:46.849
- Closer's going national.

54:46.884 --> 54:48.083
- What?
- Yes, it's gonna.

54:48.119 --> 54:49.852
- Oh, my gosh, I'm
so proud of you.

54:51.289 --> 54:54.490
Look at ya, you're like
my little digital cupid.

54:54.525 --> 54:55.291
That's awesome.

54:56.927 --> 54:58.661
This is a good
thing, right, honey?

54:58.696 --> 54:59.895
- I don't, I don't know.

54:59.964 --> 55:02.564
After Evan, I don't think I'm
qualified to be a match maker.

55:02.600 --> 55:03.899
- Okay, no, Alana, look.

55:03.934 --> 55:05.367
You are an amazing match maker.

55:05.403 --> 55:07.703
You got Sam and James,
you love, love, right?

55:07.738 --> 55:08.704
That's not a crime.

55:09.573 --> 55:11.206
What are you doing?

55:14.879 --> 55:16.412
- You should give this to Leah.

55:17.415 --> 55:19.014
It'll look pretty in here hair.

55:24.722 --> 55:26.188
- You know, even if
you weren't qualified

55:26.223 --> 55:27.923
to be a match maker,
which you are,

55:29.226 --> 55:31.960
it's still not like you
could stop yourself.

55:31.996 --> 55:33.095
Hey, Kai.
- Hey.

55:37.068 --> 55:38.067
- Hey.

55:38.102 --> 55:39.101
- Listen, I'm sorry.

55:40.838 --> 55:43.872
Well you know how this
town is, everyone cares,

55:43.908 --> 55:44.907
and gossips.

55:47.244 --> 55:48.544
Do you wanna talk about it?

55:48.579 --> 55:50.579
- No, not really.

55:50.614 --> 55:52.481
- Not even friend to friend?

55:52.516 --> 55:53.582
- Friend to friend.

55:56.087 --> 55:56.919
No.

55:58.122 --> 55:59.788
But I'm glad to have
a friend right now.

56:02.426 --> 56:04.126
- Well this all
looks really good.

56:05.129 --> 56:06.328
- It does, right?

56:06.364 --> 56:07.996
- Yeah, looks like
you're almost done.

56:08.032 --> 56:10.232
- Ugh, are you kidding, Mel
is delivering the furniture

56:10.267 --> 56:12.000
tomorrow, which is
gonna be a huge project,

56:12.036 --> 56:14.002
and then we start to
prep for the festival.

56:14.038 --> 56:16.839
- So, what your saying is right
now, you have nothing to do?

56:16.874 --> 56:19.141
- No, I have a million things
to do besides finishing

56:19.176 --> 56:21.744
planting these flowers, I have
10,000 emails to respond to,

56:21.779 --> 56:23.579
100 calls to return,
code to write,

56:23.614 --> 56:25.447
I've been ignoring Closer
ever since I got here.

56:25.483 --> 56:26.315
It's just.

56:27.818 --> 56:29.284
- Well, you know.

56:30.454 --> 56:33.589
The sun's out, the water's calm.

56:47.338 --> 56:50.172
(sea bird cawing)

56:52.343 --> 56:55.310
- This is really
nice and so light.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.780
Did you make these?

56:57.815 --> 56:58.647
- Yeah.

57:00.851 --> 57:05.654
- Look at you, making kayaks,
owning your own business.

57:05.689 --> 57:07.423
- Just trying to
keep up with you.

57:09.927 --> 57:10.793
So you ready?

57:15.332 --> 57:16.365
- Actually, I am.

57:18.436 --> 57:21.203
(hands slapping)

57:40.157 --> 57:41.790
This is so beautiful.

57:41.826 --> 57:43.792
The sun on my skin.

57:43.828 --> 57:47.696
Just taking it slow
and feeling so--

57:48.833 --> 57:49.665
- Connected.

57:51.368 --> 57:52.000
I don't get it.

57:53.904 --> 57:55.737
You love being out on the water.

57:55.773 --> 57:56.805
So why'd you stop?

57:58.008 --> 58:00.175
- When I first got
to Chicago I was out

58:00.211 --> 58:02.478
on the water as
much as I could be.

58:02.513 --> 58:05.481
Kayaking, paddle
boarding, sailing.

58:07.518 --> 58:09.952
It made me feel connected
to Safety Harbor.

58:12.056 --> 58:13.489
The ocean...

58:16.760 --> 58:17.626
And you.

58:21.065 --> 58:22.664
I was out on the
water and it was like

58:22.700 --> 58:24.333
you were right there with me.

58:26.904 --> 58:30.572
Feeling you so close,
that's why I stopped.

58:32.309 --> 58:34.076
- That's why I'll never stop.

58:49.126 --> 58:53.629
- Today was wonderful
and I love your kayak.

58:53.664 --> 58:56.632
- Good then keep it.

58:56.667 --> 58:58.100
I'll ship it to Chicago.

58:58.135 --> 58:59.635
I've been trying to
name it and today helped

58:59.670 --> 59:01.703
me come up with the perfect one.

59:01.739 --> 59:03.205
So it's a gift.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.908
- Thank you, but you know
I don't kayak anymore.

59:05.943 --> 59:08.677
- Ah, maybe you'll start again.

59:09.847 --> 59:10.913
- So what's the name?

59:12.483 --> 59:14.216
Of the kayak?

59:14.251 --> 59:15.817
- Oh, that's a surprise.

59:15.853 --> 59:17.052
- Another surprise?

59:17.087 --> 59:18.921
- Mm hm.
- Like maybe one day

59:18.956 --> 59:21.390
saying something nice?

59:21.425 --> 59:23.859
- I guess now you have
two surprises to wait for.

59:25.796 --> 59:28.130
(chuckling)

59:33.370 --> 59:35.003
- [Alana] Okay, here we go.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.739
(light music)
- Where do you want this?

59:37.775 --> 59:38.707
Right here?

59:39.810 --> 59:42.077
- No, have it over here.

59:42.112 --> 59:42.911
- [Micah] Okay, you got it?

59:42.947 --> 59:43.879
- [Alana] No, there.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.047
- [Micah] Just go over there.

59:45.082 --> 59:48.083
- [Alana] No, the other way.

59:48.118 --> 59:49.251
Dad, that does not go--

59:49.286 --> 59:50.719
- [Micah] Right, look, feel it.

59:50.754 --> 59:52.087
- [Alana] Does this go here
or does it not go there?

59:52.122 --> 59:53.055
- [Micah] No, no, no.

59:53.090 --> 59:53.822
- Does it?
- Here let me.

59:53.857 --> 59:54.723
Can I just do it?

59:54.758 --> 59:59.461
Okay, (chuckling)

1:00:07.805 --> 1:00:08.637
Oh.

1:00:12.776 --> 1:00:13.609
Oh.

1:00:21.552 --> 1:00:22.484
- Are you okay?

1:00:23.954 --> 1:00:25.454
- Yeah, I just remember
doing this with your mom

1:00:25.489 --> 1:00:28.090
when we first moved into
the inn and you know,

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:30.425
then again when we remodeled.

1:00:31.795 --> 1:00:33.295
A lot of good memories.

1:00:33.330 --> 1:00:35.597
- And a lot of time ahead
to make more good memories.

1:00:37.368 --> 1:00:38.166
- Yeah.

1:00:39.570 --> 1:00:41.470
- You know, Dad, the reason
why I didn't come home

1:00:41.505 --> 1:00:43.271
is because I thought
it would be hard,

1:00:43.307 --> 1:00:46.608
but when I got here I realized
that if I shut myself down

1:00:46.644 --> 1:00:49.311
to the hard stuff, I'll
end up shutting myself down

1:00:49.346 --> 1:00:50.145
to the good stuff too.

1:00:51.682 --> 1:00:53.882
And I don't wanna
miss the good stuff.

1:00:53.917 --> 1:00:54.816
- No.

1:00:54.852 --> 1:00:56.785
- And I don't want
you to miss it either.

1:01:00.691 --> 1:01:01.957
- [Micah] Okay.

1:01:05.896 --> 1:01:07.396
- You're amazing.

1:01:07.431 --> 1:01:09.798
You have such a big heart
and so much love to give,

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:10.732
and I want you to give it.

1:01:10.768 --> 1:01:12.000
- Is this going somewhere?

1:01:12.036 --> 1:01:14.136
Are we talking about the inn?

1:01:14.171 --> 1:01:15.504
- Yes, the inn.

1:01:15.539 --> 1:01:18.473
Although, I respect
whatever decision you make.

1:01:18.509 --> 1:01:19.808
I don't want you to sell.

1:01:21.445 --> 1:01:23.945
But this is also about Leah.

1:01:25.082 --> 1:01:27.049
You two would be
so good together.

1:01:27.084 --> 1:01:29.284
You are neighbors
and compatible.

1:01:31.255 --> 1:01:33.321
That stuff doesn't matter.

1:01:33.357 --> 1:01:36.491
What matters is that
you two have that zing.

1:01:37.695 --> 1:01:39.561
The lightning bolts
and butterflies.

1:01:42.366 --> 1:01:45.834
- How did you get to
be so wonderful, huh?

1:01:45.869 --> 1:01:46.835
- Genetics?

1:01:46.870 --> 1:01:48.070
(laughing)

1:01:48.105 --> 1:01:49.705
- Obviously on your
mom's side, yes.

1:01:51.608 --> 1:01:53.041
- So, Dad?

1:01:53.077 --> 1:01:54.342
- [Micah] Yeah?

1:01:55.546 --> 1:01:57.045
- Is now a good
time to ask about

1:01:57.081 --> 1:01:59.347
the floating lantern ceremony?

1:01:59.383 --> 1:02:01.383
I'd love to float
a lantern for mom.

1:02:01.418 --> 1:02:02.350
- Can I get back to you on that?

1:02:02.386 --> 1:02:04.653
I mean, we have so much to plan.

1:02:06.557 --> 1:02:08.190
- Sure.

1:02:08.225 --> 1:02:10.392
(waves crashing)

1:02:10.427 --> 1:02:13.261
(muffled talking)

1:02:44.294 --> 1:02:46.928
(phone ringing)

1:02:50.033 --> 1:02:51.233
Hey.

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:53.668
- Hey, Atlas is asking
for the contract.

1:02:53.704 --> 1:02:55.237
Did you sign it yet?

1:02:55.272 --> 1:02:56.271
- I was just looking it over,

1:02:56.306 --> 1:02:59.574
but what if Closer doesn't work?

1:02:59.610 --> 1:03:01.510
- What do you mean,
of course it works.

1:03:01.545 --> 1:03:03.912
Think of all the success
stories we've heard about.

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:06.681
And mister next
building over sent me

1:03:06.717 --> 1:03:08.750
calla lilies this morning.

1:03:08.786 --> 1:03:09.651
They're his favorite.

1:03:09.686 --> 1:03:11.186
- Your favorite.

1:03:11.221 --> 1:03:14.523
- Exactly and I'm not saying
that liking the same flower

1:03:14.558 --> 1:03:18.093
makes us soulmates, but what
I am saying is that just

1:03:18.128 --> 1:03:20.595
because Closer didn't
work for you and Evan,

1:03:20.631 --> 1:03:22.130
doesn't mean it doesn't work.

1:03:22.166 --> 1:03:24.933
- This isn't about me and
Evan, it really isn't.

1:03:24.968 --> 1:03:26.868
This is me worried that
we're putting an app out

1:03:26.904 --> 1:03:28.970
there that's telling users
love is a combination

1:03:29.006 --> 1:03:31.807
of compatibility and
proximity when it's not.

1:03:31.842 --> 1:03:34.676
- Alana, I'm not sure
where this is coming from,

1:03:34.711 --> 1:03:37.779
and I support whatever
you decide to do,

1:03:37.815 --> 1:03:42.284
but I believe in Closer
and I wanna take this deal.

1:03:43.487 --> 1:03:45.954
(Alana sighs)

1:03:45.989 --> 1:03:47.355
I'll talk to you later.

1:03:49.493 --> 1:03:50.992
- This'll look great in here.

1:03:51.829 --> 1:03:53.995
Oh yeah, right here.

1:03:55.199 --> 1:03:56.832
Look, it matches the couch.

1:03:56.867 --> 1:03:57.699
It's great.

1:03:58.535 --> 1:04:00.802
Um, okay so.

1:04:00.838 --> 1:04:03.538
This needs to be filled, right?

1:04:04.408 --> 1:04:05.974
Cool.

1:04:06.009 --> 1:04:09.110
So we'll put the starfish here.

1:04:12.616 --> 1:04:13.515
What's going on?

1:04:18.522 --> 1:04:19.654
- Renee and I have been offered

1:04:19.690 --> 1:04:21.823
funding to take Closer national.

1:04:21.859 --> 1:04:23.325
- Congratulations.

1:04:24.862 --> 1:04:26.394
But not congratulations.

1:04:26.430 --> 1:04:30.832
- The problem is Closer
is matching people based,

1:04:30.868 --> 1:04:32.267
but not on love.

1:04:32.302 --> 1:04:34.736
Because of course an app
can't determine love.

1:04:34.771 --> 1:04:36.071
- There's no app for that.

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:39.674
- What if we're
getting in loves way

1:04:39.710 --> 1:04:41.743
and we're about to do
it on a national scale?

1:04:41.778 --> 1:04:43.612
- I have a feeling you're not.

1:04:43.647 --> 1:04:46.748
But maybe even if your app
doesn't bring the right

1:04:46.783 --> 1:04:50.018
people together, fate
would still find a way.

1:04:50.053 --> 1:04:53.021
If you believe in love so much,

1:04:53.056 --> 1:04:55.790
then believe it has a way
of working itself out.

1:04:55.826 --> 1:04:57.158
Even without you meddling.

1:05:01.398 --> 1:05:02.631
(whistling)

1:05:02.666 --> 1:05:05.467
- Whoa, this place is
really coming to life.

1:05:05.502 --> 1:05:07.102
Look at that.

1:05:07.137 --> 1:05:09.871
Well, I think it's
time to get ready.

1:05:09.907 --> 1:05:10.805
- For what?

1:05:10.841 --> 1:05:14.075
(light dramatic music)

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:31.293
(people talking over each other)

1:05:31.328 --> 1:05:34.195
(people laughing)

1:05:53.283 --> 1:05:54.816
- Welcome.

1:05:54.851 --> 1:05:57.852
I'm so glad everyone
could be here.

1:05:57.888 --> 1:06:00.922
You know this is one of our
most special traditions.

1:06:00.958 --> 1:06:05.093
We float our lanterns to honor
those who mean so much to us.

1:06:05.128 --> 1:06:08.763
Not just those whom we
remember in our hearts,

1:06:08.799 --> 1:06:10.966
but those that we hold
close in our arms.

1:06:11.001 --> 1:06:14.135
Let this remind
us that our hearts

1:06:14.171 --> 1:06:17.672
are the light of this
world, guiding our way.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:20.909
So, let's share our light.

1:06:22.813 --> 1:06:25.747
(lighter clicking)

1:06:29.186 --> 1:06:33.121
(light dramatic music)

1:06:33.156 --> 1:06:35.557
(applauding)

1:06:35.592 --> 1:06:38.460
(muffled talking)

1:07:18.802 --> 1:07:20.235
- Ready?

1:07:20.270 --> 1:07:21.136
- Wait.

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:26.641
- That's your mother's
favorite flower.

1:08:21.998 --> 1:08:24.432
- It's been really special
spending time with you.

1:08:27.537 --> 1:08:31.072
Somehow Safety Harbor
always feels a little bit

1:08:31.108 --> 1:08:32.740
more like home when you're here.

1:08:50.927 --> 1:08:53.061
- [Man] Three hotdogs,
two hamburgers.

1:08:53.096 --> 1:08:54.395
(muffled talking)

1:08:54.431 --> 1:08:56.731
Three hotdogs, two hamburgers.

1:08:56.766 --> 1:08:59.601
(muffled talking)

1:09:04.307 --> 1:09:06.474
Three hotdogs, two hamburgers.

1:09:06.510 --> 1:09:09.244
(muffled talking)

1:09:09.279 --> 1:09:10.411
- Hi, how are you?
- Can we sit down?

1:09:10.447 --> 1:09:12.847
- [Woman] Good to
see you again, hello.

1:09:12.883 --> 1:09:15.083
- [Woman] It's almost
done, hang in there okay?

1:09:15.118 --> 1:09:16.017
- Okay.
- Smile.

1:09:16.052 --> 1:09:17.585
If you smile that would be good.

1:09:24.327 --> 1:09:26.628
- Compliments of Southern Fresh.

1:09:26.663 --> 1:09:27.762
I still can't believe you let

1:09:27.797 --> 1:09:29.197
my dad talk you into that name.

1:09:29.232 --> 1:09:32.133
- Well, when I saw
how happy it made him.

1:09:32.169 --> 1:09:33.868
- You know, that's
all I ever want.

1:09:33.904 --> 1:09:35.003
For him to be happy.

1:09:36.006 --> 1:09:38.506
So speaking of my dad.

1:09:38.542 --> 1:09:41.442
- Yes, I've been
meaning to ask you.

1:09:41.478 --> 1:09:42.844
Do I have your blessing?

1:09:44.147 --> 1:09:45.613
- Of course you do.

1:09:45.649 --> 1:09:47.182
Nothing would make me happier.

1:09:47.217 --> 1:09:48.750
- I'm so happy to hear that.

1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:51.653
And what about you and Kai?

1:09:52.856 --> 1:09:54.689
Who knows what the
future will bring?

1:09:55.725 --> 1:09:56.591
- Who does know?

1:09:57.827 --> 1:09:59.027
I definitely don't.

1:10:00.397 --> 1:10:02.463
I mean, I'm leaving in two days.

1:10:02.499 --> 1:10:04.165
- How are you
feeling about that?

1:10:05.101 --> 1:10:07.835
- Honestly, like I wanna stay.

1:10:10.674 --> 1:10:12.740
Leah, when you decided to
leave your life in New York

1:10:12.776 --> 1:10:16.344
and come back here, how did
you know it was gonna work out?

1:10:18.248 --> 1:10:18.880
- I didn't.

1:10:20.250 --> 1:10:21.849
It's a lot like love, you know?

1:10:23.019 --> 1:10:24.485
When you take the leap,
you don't know what's

1:10:24.521 --> 1:10:26.721
waiting on the other side.

1:10:26.756 --> 1:10:27.989
You just have to trust.

1:10:30.393 --> 1:10:32.160
- But what if you can't trust?

1:10:32.195 --> 1:10:33.995
- I think you'll know it's
the right decision when

1:10:34.030 --> 1:10:36.731
it feels like your gaining
more than you're giving up.

1:10:55.218 --> 1:10:58.353
(phone ringing)

1:10:58.388 --> 1:10:59.754
- Hey, Renee.

1:10:59.789 --> 1:11:01.589
- [Renee] Hey, how's it going?

1:11:01.625 --> 1:11:04.025
- Just grappling
with this contract.

1:11:04.060 --> 1:11:05.460
- So talk to me.

1:11:05.495 --> 1:11:07.061
What's goin' on?

1:11:07.097 --> 1:11:10.031
- I've been thinking about
Closer nonstop and I feel like,

1:11:11.935 --> 1:11:14.469
I'm not sure if I
can stand behind it.

1:11:14.504 --> 1:11:16.104
When we first started Closer,

1:11:16.139 --> 1:11:18.606
I just had my heart
broken by Kai.

1:11:18.642 --> 1:11:20.241
- Yeah, Kai.

1:11:20.277 --> 1:11:23.311
- And that affected
my perception of love
and relationships.

1:11:23.346 --> 1:11:25.546
But being home in the place
I love with the people

1:11:25.582 --> 1:11:26.914
I love and
reconnecting with Kai,

1:11:26.950 --> 1:11:29.651
has made me rethink
those perceptions.

1:11:29.686 --> 1:11:30.818
And I'm wondering if maybe this

1:11:30.854 --> 1:11:32.620
is all happening for a reason.

1:11:33.490 --> 1:11:36.958
Coming back home and Kai.

1:11:39.095 --> 1:11:40.795
If maybe I'm meant to stay here

1:11:40.830 --> 1:11:42.797
and you're meant to
move on with Closer.

1:11:45.001 --> 1:11:47.402
- But you've worked so hard.

1:11:47.437 --> 1:11:48.670
- [Alana] I know.

1:11:48.705 --> 1:11:52.073
- And now you're gonna
give it up for a guy?

1:11:52.108 --> 1:11:55.143
A guy who you've
reconnected with for a week?

1:11:55.178 --> 1:11:58.446
A guy who it didn't work
out with the first time.

1:11:58.481 --> 1:12:00.848
- This isn't about Kai,
it's about me and Closer

1:12:00.884 --> 1:12:02.350
and wanting to be home.

1:12:02.385 --> 1:12:04.919
About feeling like this
is the right choice.

1:12:04.954 --> 1:12:09.957
- Okay and maybe it is, but
also maybe, you're homesick.

1:12:11.227 --> 1:12:14.195
Maybe Kai's just old
feelings resurfacing

1:12:14.230 --> 1:12:17.332
or even the last light
of a dying torch.

1:12:17.367 --> 1:12:20.101
Um, I'm just trying
to be sensible here.

1:12:20.136 --> 1:12:23.504
You've worked so hard and
you'd be giving so much up.

1:12:27.410 --> 1:12:28.476
- I'll call you back.

1:12:44.828 --> 1:12:46.961
(sighing)

1:13:00.443 --> 1:13:01.309
- Hey.

1:13:03.346 --> 1:13:04.178
- Hey.

1:13:06.349 --> 1:13:07.348
Wanna go for a walk?

1:13:08.918 --> 1:13:09.784
- Sure.

1:13:30.273 --> 1:13:33.207
- It's been incredible
reconnecting with you,

1:13:33.243 --> 1:13:34.575
but I took the Atlas deal.

1:13:36.546 --> 1:13:38.546
I'm going back to
Chicago in two days.

1:13:39.416 --> 1:13:40.248
- I know.

1:13:42.051 --> 1:13:43.885
That's all I've
been thinking about.

1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:45.720
What are we gonna do?

1:13:46.556 --> 1:13:47.822
- I don't know.

1:13:49.492 --> 1:13:52.960
The reality is that I'm
there and you're here.

1:13:52.996 --> 1:13:54.862
- I can go there,
you can come here.

1:13:54.898 --> 1:13:56.397
- We already tried that.

1:13:56.433 --> 1:13:57.765
- Then let's try it again.

1:13:57.801 --> 1:13:59.000
- But it didn't work.

1:14:03.606 --> 1:14:05.440
- So you're just
gonna give up on us?

1:14:06.609 --> 1:14:07.909
We have something special.

1:14:10.847 --> 1:14:11.712
- I know.

1:14:14.751 --> 1:14:17.084
Maybe it's old
feelings resurfacing.

1:14:19.289 --> 1:14:24.091
A vacation romance, a fairytale.

1:14:28.031 --> 1:14:30.898
- Well for it being a fantasy,
it sure feels real to me.

1:14:38.475 --> 1:14:39.707
(people talking over each other)

1:14:39.742 --> 1:14:41.175
- [Man] Yeah, yeah, I
kinda agree with you.

1:14:41.211 --> 1:14:43.377
It's like a group setting.

1:14:45.615 --> 1:14:47.682
- [Woman] It's always
done, hang in there okay?

1:14:47.717 --> 1:14:48.883
- Okay.
- Smile.

1:14:48.918 --> 1:14:51.752
If you smile, it'll
be better, okay?

1:14:56.125 --> 1:15:01.162
- These orchids.
(chuckling)

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:04.765
- Huh, it's happening.

1:15:05.668 --> 1:15:07.101
Are we in paradise or what?

1:15:08.304 --> 1:15:10.872
I still can't believe
we pulled this off.

1:15:10.907 --> 1:15:12.740
- I know, me neither.

1:15:12.775 --> 1:15:15.042
But we did and the
inn looks amazing.

1:15:15.078 --> 1:15:16.344
- It really does.

1:15:17.413 --> 1:15:18.312
You may have your mom's beauty,

1:15:18.348 --> 1:15:20.314
but you definitely
got my sense of style.

1:15:20.350 --> 1:15:22.049
- [Alana] Yeah right.

1:15:22.085 --> 1:15:23.951
- You know your mom
would be so happy.

1:15:26.422 --> 1:15:29.223
And you know, honey, I
know you hope that hosting

1:15:29.259 --> 1:15:32.460
the festival and seeing the inn
filled with all these people

1:15:32.495 --> 1:15:37.532
would make me change my mind
and you are absolutely right.

1:15:40.937 --> 1:15:41.769
- What?

1:15:42.605 --> 1:15:43.738
Really?

1:15:43.773 --> 1:15:45.239
You're not selling the inn?

1:15:45.275 --> 1:15:47.275
- No, I'm gonna reopen.

1:15:47.310 --> 1:15:49.577
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- No, yes.

1:15:49.612 --> 1:15:51.612
I am going to reopen the inn,

1:15:51.648 --> 1:15:53.414
and now you have
to come back soon

1:15:53.449 --> 1:15:54.515
and be my very first guest.

1:15:54.551 --> 1:15:56.384
- No, dad, I won't be a guest.

1:15:57.654 --> 1:15:58.886
Because this is my home.

1:16:01.391 --> 1:16:02.256
- Always.

1:16:03.693 --> 1:16:04.926
- Excuse me, everyone.

1:16:04.961 --> 1:16:06.427
Can we have your
attention please?

1:16:06.462 --> 1:16:07.528
- I know you.
- Oh Dad, come on, come on.

1:16:07.564 --> 1:16:08.796
- [Micah] But I'll make it.

1:16:12.735 --> 1:16:14.702
- Oh, this is so exciting.

1:16:14.737 --> 1:16:16.938
- We wanna thank everyone
for coming and to all

1:16:16.973 --> 1:16:19.373
of Safety Harbor for your
support in putting this on.

1:16:19.409 --> 1:16:21.842
- Especially Micah and Alana.

1:16:21.878 --> 1:16:24.445
We couldn't of done
this without you.

1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:25.646
- Aw, I hope.

1:16:25.682 --> 1:16:27.048
(crowd applauding)
(crowd cheering)

1:16:27.083 --> 1:16:29.850
No really, you
talked me into it.

1:16:31.020 --> 1:16:32.987
- We'd also like to give
a very special thanks

1:16:33.022 --> 1:16:34.622
to our festival sponsor.

1:16:34.657 --> 1:16:37.792
The nation's leading water
sports equipment manufacturer,

1:16:37.827 --> 1:16:42.296
and Safety Harbor's very
own, Kai Olsen's Kai-yak.

1:16:44.167 --> 1:16:47.535
- Woo, yeah!
(crowd applauding)

1:16:50.206 --> 1:16:52.740
- You know, I came
up with that name.

1:16:52.775 --> 1:16:53.975
- Kai, are you here?

1:16:54.010 --> 1:16:55.309
You wanna come up
and say a few words?

1:16:58.014 --> 1:16:59.647
- No?
- That's odd.

1:16:59.682 --> 1:17:01.849
- So, What are we gonna do?
- I guess we'll announce it.

1:17:01.884 --> 1:17:03.517
- Thank you guys again
so much for coming

1:17:03.553 --> 1:17:05.353
and please, enjoy the festival.

1:17:07.123 --> 1:17:08.789
- Kai owns Kai-yak?

1:17:08.825 --> 1:17:10.191
Like the biggest brand there is?

1:17:10.226 --> 1:17:11.792
- I thought you knew?

1:17:11.828 --> 1:17:14.195
Sam said Kai told you what
he's been doing for work.

1:17:14.230 --> 1:17:17.264
- He told me he makes
kayaks and paddle boards.

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:19.834
- Sounds like he left out
a few important details.

1:17:21.771 --> 1:17:22.637
- Why didn't he tell me?

1:17:22.672 --> 1:17:24.639
- You know Kai, he's humble.

1:17:24.674 --> 1:17:27.408
He started the company when
he came back from Chicago.

1:17:29.178 --> 1:17:30.044
And I've heard
him in interviews.

1:17:30.079 --> 1:17:33.280
When asked what inspires
him, he says you.

1:17:36.919 --> 1:17:38.986
- I really messed
things up with him.

1:17:39.022 --> 1:17:41.155
- It's not too late
to make it right.

1:17:41.190 --> 1:17:42.123
- He might not want that.

1:17:42.158 --> 1:17:43.324
(light dramatic music)

1:17:43.359 --> 1:17:45.559
- Something tells me he would.

1:17:48.197 --> 1:17:49.463
Yes, come on, go find him.

1:17:51.134 --> 1:17:52.800
- Okay.
- Yes.

1:17:52.835 --> 1:17:55.369
- Now I see where Alana
gets her matchmaking gene.

1:17:57.173 --> 1:17:58.539
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1:18:18.394 --> 1:18:21.195
(phone ringing)

1:18:21.230 --> 1:18:22.463
- Hi.

1:18:22.498 --> 1:18:23.998
- Hey, what time do
you get in tomorrow?

1:18:24.033 --> 1:18:25.833
Atlas just called and
wants to have lunch.

1:18:25.868 --> 1:18:27.702
- Around noon, so 1:00?

1:18:27.737 --> 1:18:29.136
- Perfect.

1:18:29.172 --> 1:18:31.605
- But, Renee, we can
discuss with Atlas tomorrow,

1:18:31.641 --> 1:18:33.874
but I wanna make
changes to Closer.

1:18:33.910 --> 1:18:36.844
What Closer should
really be about is love,

1:18:36.879 --> 1:18:40.548
because that's what really
matters; connection.

1:18:40.583 --> 1:18:43.284
- I like that, but
how do we execute.

1:18:43.319 --> 1:18:45.886
- I'm not sure, but
we'll figure it out.

1:18:45.922 --> 1:18:48.222
- Okay, I believe in you.
