01:03.440 --> 01:06.989
This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship Red Dwarf,

01:07.080 --> 01:10.197
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak,

01:10.280 --> 01:12.236
The only survivors were Dave Lister,

01:12.320 --> 01:15.073
who was in suspended animation
during the disaster,

01:15.160 --> 01:18.072
and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold,

01:18.160 --> 01:20.276
Revived three million years later,

01:20.360 --> 01:23.955
Lister's only companions are
a life form who evolved from his cat

01:24.040 --> 01:26.634
and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram
simulation of one of the dead crew,

01:29.800 --> 01:31.995
In the three million years we have been away,

01:32.080 --> 01:34.719
it is my fond hope that mankind
has abolished war,

01:34.800 --> 01:38.076
cured all disease and got rid
of those little western saloon doors

01:38.160 --> 01:40.116
you get in trendy shops,

01:41.440 --> 01:46.150
- 140,000 rehydrateable chickens.
- Check.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.518
- 72 tons of reconstituted patty.
- Check.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.916
4,691 irradiated haggis.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.116
It's Saturday night. I've had enough.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.112
4,691 irradiated haggis.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.555
It's Saturday night. I want to boogie on down.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.235
4,691 irradiated haggis.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.312
We've been doing this for four hours.
Let's have a break.

02:08.479 --> 02:11.677
4,691 irradiated haggis.

02:11.840 --> 02:16.994
Will you stop saying
4,981 irradiated haggis, and speak to me?

02:18.640 --> 02:21.234
4,691 irradiated haggis.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.955
Rimmer, I want to go for a drink.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.390
4,691 irradiated haggis.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.990
- I want some fun!
- This is fun, are you mad?

02:31.200 --> 02:34.397
You read something out,
I say "check". Where's the fun?

02:34.640 --> 02:38.918
All right. We'll put you in command
for a few seconds, Cap-i-tain.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.752
What's the plan? Lickety-split.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.354
- Go back to Earth.
- And in the meantime?

02:43.440 --> 02:47.115
I dunno. Just sort of generally
slob around... have a few laughs.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.479
Excellent plan, Lister.
Excellent plan. Brilliant plan.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.513
I was thinking you hadn't thought
about it. Clearly, you have.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.319
I'll stand over here and laugh slobbily, shall I?

02:57.480 --> 03:00.199
I'm going for a drink. Where's me cigarettes?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.671
I only owe you four and three quarters.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.112
You owe me five.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.760
One cigarette for each day you obey me.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.751
Five days, five cigarettes.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.115
I'm penalising you one quarter of a cigarette

03:12.200 --> 03:14.237
for saying, "check" in a variety of silly voices,

03:14.320 --> 03:16.311
while doing the homogenised puddings.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.436
Well, I'm taking five.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.275
You do and I'll eject the rest
of the ship's stock into space.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.796
Ha, ha, ha.
So, they're somewhere near an airlock?

03:25.960 --> 03:28.190
Ha, ha, ha. You'll never find them, Lister.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.238
I was always a master
at "Hide and Seek" as a child.

03:31.320 --> 03:35.393
- It's not a gift you lose.
- OK, quark brain.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.755
Even it out. Take out the flaky bits.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.998
Oh, I really, really hate you, Rimmer.

03:42.080 --> 03:46.358
Have a lovely, lovely time, Lister.
Give my regards to the air.

03:55.240 --> 03:58.755
Lights! Holly, why Rimmer as a hologram?

03:58.840 --> 04:01.798
Why did you have to bring
Rimmer's hologram back?

04:02.720 --> 04:05.393
He was the most unpopular man on this ship.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.393
He even had to organise
his own surprise birthday parties.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.716
Who should I have brought back, then?

04:12.800 --> 04:15.360
Anyone. Chen... Petersen...

04:15.440 --> 04:18.351
Hermann GÃ¶ring would have
been more of a laugh than Rimmer.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.238
OK, he was a drug-crazed transvestite,

04:21.320 --> 04:24.278
but at least we could have gone dancing. Water!

04:24.440 --> 04:27.876
I brought Rimmer back because he's
the best person to keep you sane,

04:27.960 --> 04:29.678
Oh, crap.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.751
Not you!

04:31.880 --> 04:35.429
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention, See you later,

04:35.720 --> 04:39.952
What about Kristine Kochanski?
You could have brought Kristine back.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.878
Your entire life,
your shared conversations with her

04:42.960 --> 04:45.793
- totalled 173 words,
- So?

04:45.880 --> 04:48.952
In terms of wordage, you had
a better relationship with your plant,

04:49.040 --> 04:52.715
- I know, but Ri mmer!
- He's the person you knew best,

04:52.800 --> 04:54.711
Over 14 million words in all,

04:54.880 --> 04:58.111
Seven mi llion of those
were me telling him to smeg off,

04:58.200 --> 05:01.875
and the rest were him putting me
on report for telling him to smeg off.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.837
Jean-Paul Sartre said

05:03.920 --> 05:06.798
hell was being locked forever
in a room with your friends,

05:06.960 --> 05:09.269
Yeah, well, all his mates were French.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.391
Aaaaaaah! Blwoooooo!

05:36.560 --> 05:40.599
I've been to Titan, I've been to Juno.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.797
I can name eight things
that go in jars that you know.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.757
Pickles.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.798
- Jam.
- Spaghetti.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.757
Brains.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.151
What, in jars?

05:53.320 --> 05:55.754
Me uncle's brain is in a jar. It's really sad.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.468
- Why's it sad?
- He's not dead yet.

05:59.280 --> 06:03.239
Everybody's punished. Finish your drinks.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.428
Argh, yeah, yargh.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.268
Will you please excuse me?

06:13.360 --> 06:16.636
Some of us have more important things
to do than wiggle our posteriors.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.713
Will you move, please? Thank you.
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.351
If you want to dance, do it over there.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.158
- Ow!
- Sorry.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.270
That woman is out of your league.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.918
- She's too classy for you.
- Who is?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.833
- Kochanski.
- I've no big thing about Kochanski.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.957
Stick to your usual type.
Women with little wispy beards

06:44.040 --> 06:47.032
who wear three overcoats
and carry little bags of string.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.672
- Officer Kochanski?!
- Sh! Shut up!

06:50.840 --> 06:55.914
- Have you eaten a coconut whole?
- You've no chance with her.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.074
- You're just too ugly.
- I've no big thing about Kochanski.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.151
- I have.
- So have I.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.197
- Where's my revision timetable?
- Sir, it's Saturday night.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.191
Nobody works Saturday night.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.271
You don't work ANY night or day!

07:14.400 --> 07:16.789
Skive hard, play hard, that's our motto.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.235
I've got my engineering re-sit on Monday.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.390
I don't know anything. Where is my timetable?

07:21.560 --> 07:23.551
Is it the thing with all different colours,

07:23.800 --> 07:26.360
with subjects divided into study and rest periods,

07:26.440 --> 07:29.830
- and self-testing times?
- It took me seven weeks to make it.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.990
Now I've to cram the revision in one night!

07:32.080 --> 07:34.355
The thing with a note on it, in red,

07:34.440 --> 07:37.910
"Vital, valuable, urgent.
Do not touch on pain of death"?

07:38.080 --> 07:40.071
- Yes!
- I threw it away.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.594
- Ha-ha, tee-hee. Where is it?
- I pinned it up on the wall.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.069
- Why?
- To dry it out.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.311
- What do you mean, dry it out?
- I spilt a goat vindaloo on it.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.552
It's a bit red, but you can read
most of it if you scrape the lumps off!

07:55.640 --> 07:58.200
You spoilt my... No, I haven't time,

07:58.280 --> 08:00.555
I'm taking learning drugs
and memorising this conversation.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.712
- They're illegal.
- Where's my timetable, Lister?

08:03.800 --> 08:06.075
It's Saturday night.
You don't work Saturday night.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.196
You don't work any night or any day.

08:08.280 --> 08:12.193
Skive hard, play hard - my motto.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.316
Brrrrr... Bleaaaa...

08:15.400 --> 08:18.915
I've been to Titan, I've been to Lobanski

08:19.000 --> 08:21.912
I can name 90 men who've slept with Kochanski.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.316
- Me, me, me!
- The London Jet Juniors!

08:24.480 --> 08:26.675
- The Service Droids!
- My mother.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.596
OK. Leave it alone. Leave it.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.515
Alone.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.952
Aaaargh!

08:55.680 --> 09:00.834
Oh, baby! Hey! Jump back. Come back. Heh!

09:01.320 --> 09:03.709
How'm I looking?

09:04.560 --> 09:06.915
I'm looking nice.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.395
My hair is nice, my face is nice, my suit is nice.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.436
I'm looking really nice.

09:13.640 --> 09:18.668
Aawh! Jump back. Ooh-eah. Hey! Get down.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.230
Wonder how I'm looking now?

09:23.840 --> 09:27.674
Still looking nice. My hair's still nice.
My face is still nice...

09:27.760 --> 09:30.035
My suit. I'm just nice, period.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.156
Aawh! Jump back. Get down. Oooh, heh!

09:34.240 --> 09:38.392
Good evening, you stupid,
stinking, festering, gimboid of a cat.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.993
Ah, you're going to put
these cigarettes back, aren't you?

09:44.080 --> 09:47.436
Excuse me! This is my all-time lucky find

09:47.520 --> 09:49.511
I ever found in the whole of today.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.479
No. You're going to put
these cigarettes back before he comes.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.677
- These are mine.
- They're not, put them back.

09:56.760 --> 10:00.070
See this hand? It is mine.
See these things? They are mine.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.277
- I'll give you a fish.
- One fish? Ha!

10:03.360 --> 10:05.430
- Two fish.
- For all these shiny things?

10:05.520 --> 10:08.273
I'll show you how to get
all the fish you'll ever need.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.233
- Five fish?
- Mmmm.

10:11.320 --> 10:15.711
- Five fish! I'll be rich.
- You certainly will, yes, come on.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.711
Hey, hey... Five fish?

10:20.800 --> 10:23.155
- Six fish.
- Oooooh!

10:26.800 --> 10:28.756
# Oh, dance, yeah, dance... #

10:28.840 --> 10:31.832
Lister, what on Titan is this din?

10:31.920 --> 10:34.275
LISTER!

10:34.360 --> 10:38.194
- What on Titan is this din?
- It's Rasta Billy Skank.

10:38.280 --> 10:42.398
Is this it? It has a health warning on it.
It's bad for you.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.472
- It's a classic.
- "Danger! Health Warning:

10:45.560 --> 10:47.835
"this music can make you irritable, irrational,

10:47.920 --> 10:50.957
"and is linked with disorders
of the nervous system and bowels. "

10:52.840 --> 10:55.070
No one takes notice of that stuff.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.628
If you want to dice with death, fine,

10:57.720 --> 11:01.429
but don't poison my sound waves. Off.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.031
Why don't you listen to something
really classical, like Mozart,

11:05.120 --> 11:07.190
Mendelssohn or Motorhead?

11:09.320 --> 11:11.436
I think I've gone video blind.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.515
Is that painting yours? It's rubbish.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.631
It's a mirror!

11:20.960 --> 11:22.996
I need some sleep.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.789
Rimmer, do you remember Kristine Kochanski?

11:29.880 --> 11:34.112
Navigation Officer?
Yes, I remember her. Snooty cow.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.919
She looked down on me, called me "Rimmer".

11:38.680 --> 11:40.671
Everybody called you Rimmer.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.635
It's the way she said it - "Rimmer".

11:43.720 --> 11:46.837
"Rimmer", to rhyme with "scum".

11:47.800 --> 11:50.075
God, she had a chip on her shoulder.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.959
- I want to go on a date with her.
- Tough. She's dead.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.110
- Just one night...
- No.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.350
- Turn you off for four hours...
- No. No.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.908
- Spend time with her hologram...
- No.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.195
You're worried I won't turn you back on...

12:02.280 --> 12:05.238
I promise if you tell me
where you've hidden the hologram disc...

12:05.320 --> 12:09.074
- No.
- You won't even discuss it.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.549
We are discussing it, Lister.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.313
What's this if not a discussion?
A diesel locomotive?

12:14.960 --> 12:17.918
I promise, I swear I'll turn you back on.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.276
Is that it, the entire proposal?

12:20.440 --> 12:23.398
- Yes.
- Well, Lister...

12:23.600 --> 12:25.955
Think about it seriously. Don't dismiss it.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.235
All right. I'll think about it.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.472
- You'll just say "No".
- Don't interrupt. I'm thinking.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.870
- You'll just say "No".
- Not necessarily. I'm mulling it over.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.113
Nneeee... No.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.592
Don't you trust me?

12:46.760 --> 12:50.355
I'm holding up a black card. Conversation over.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.830
I've always been crazy about her
and done nothing about it.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.150
Lister, you've forgotten the colour code.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.800
White is to continue the discussion.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.952
This is a black card situation. Discussion over.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.315
- Listen.
- # Black card, black card. #

13:04.480 --> 13:07.392
- I'm talking about something else.
- White card. Go on.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.552
I want to stop all this black card,
white card, smeg,

13:10.640 --> 13:12.835
- it's driving me crazy.
- Black card.

13:12.920 --> 13:18.438
Four hours, an evening with her hologram!
What's wrong with that?

13:18.600 --> 13:21.319
You don't know when to stop. I'm your superior.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.278
Technician was the lowest rank on this ship.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.033
The man who changed the bog rolls
was higher than us.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.438
Well, he's not here now, Lister, and we are.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.398
There's still a pecking order
and I'm pecking you, baby.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.909
OK, Rimmer... OK.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.231
- OK?
- Oh-kaaay.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.071
- Is that a threat, Lister?
- Yeah.

13:45.160 --> 13:49.119
Actually, "OK" is not a threat,
technically speaking.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.033
It is when you mean it to mean what I mean.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.671
I mean it to mean: OK, Rimmer.
Ohh-kaaay!

13:56.760 --> 14:00.958
OK is never a threat, no matter
how many "A"s you put on the end.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.512
I'm going to pass the exams
and become an officer.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.591
Come on. Wise up, Lister.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.240
You'll have to salute me, call me "Sir".

14:09.320 --> 14:12.517
You'll have to give me Kochanski
and me cigarettes.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.877
On that day, Lister,
Satan will be skating to work.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.192
Lister! Rise and shine, El Slotho. Come on!

14:31.280 --> 14:33.430
I've been awake for hours. Up, up, up.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.796
Exercise, Lister! Exercise, sonny boy.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.315
Quarter to two?

14:41.600 --> 14:44.034
I didn't set my motivator.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.590
I was supposed to be up at seven.
Why didn't he wake me?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.671
He knows I'm a heavy sleeper.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.274
Have I to remind him to do everything for me?

14:52.360 --> 14:54.396
He is so irresponsible.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.869
Holly, give me a cold shower, please.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.916
Certainly, Arnold,

14:59.800 --> 15:02.951
Ooooh! Not that cold! Hotter! Hotter!

15:03.040 --> 15:05.110
Aaaargh! Not that hot!

15:05.680 --> 15:09.309
Forget it. Can you give me a clean uniform?
Can you manage that?

15:09.760 --> 15:11.876
Thank you, Holly. Where's Lister?

15:11.960 --> 15:16.988
Holly, where's my arm?
This isn't my arm. Whose is it?

15:17.080 --> 15:20.436
Sorry, Arnold, your physical
data disc has become corrupted,

15:20.520 --> 15:22.875
No excuses. Give me my arm back.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.428
I'll refresh the graphics from a back-up,

15:25.520 --> 15:28.034
It's got tattoos. "Candy"?

15:28.120 --> 15:31.192
"Denmark Forever"?
Is this Petersen's arm, Holly?

15:31.560 --> 15:33.949
I've got the arm of a Danish moron.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.759
Bear with me for a few minutes, Arnold,

15:36.840 --> 15:39.957
It's not good enough, Holly.
It's traumatic enough being dead.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.511
Whose ears are these?

15:43.600 --> 15:47.798
They're like radar dishes stuck
higgledy-piggledy to my head.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.235
Just look at them, look at them.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.357
Whose were these ears, Holly -
an African elephant?

15:53.440 --> 15:55.590
They're your ears, Arnold,

15:56.720 --> 15:59.837
Must have been the way I slept.
No time for this. Where's Lister?

15:59.920 --> 16:02.753
That information is security protected,

16:03.800 --> 16:05.836
What's he doing?

16:11.400 --> 16:13.197
Mmmm!

16:13.720 --> 16:16.917
- Hello, how can I help you?
- Fish.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.195
Today's fish is trout Ã¡ la crÃ©me,

16:19.920 --> 16:21.831
- Enjoy your meal,
- Fish.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.151
Today's fish is trout Ã¡ la crÃ©me,
Enjoy your meal,

16:25.240 --> 16:27.834
- Fish.
- Today's fish is trout Ã¡ la crÃ©me,

16:27.920 --> 16:30.036
- Enjoy your meal,
- Fish.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.396
Today's fish is trout Ã¡ la crÃ©me,
Enjoy your meal,

16:33.480 --> 16:37.837
- Fish.
- Today's fish is trout Ã¡ la crÃ©me...

16:37.920 --> 16:40.912
- Fish.
- Today's fish is trout Ã¡ la crÃ©me,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.560
- Enjoy your meal,
- I wi ll!

16:45.520 --> 16:48.796
- Where's Lister?
- Mi ne! The fish is mine!

16:48.880 --> 16:52.111
I don't want your fish,
you stupid cat. Where's Lister?

16:52.960 --> 16:57.670
Idiot! Holly, as senior rank,
I order you to tell me where he is.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.559
- I've told you, I can't,
- It's an order.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.598
- You stupid, ugly goit.
- Ugly?

17:03.760 --> 17:07.036
I chose this face out of the billions available,

17:07.119 --> 17:10.510
as it is the face of the most
prolific lover who ever lived,

17:12.560 --> 17:14.790
Really? He must
have operated in the dark a lot.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.111
- You what?
- When are you giving me my arm?

17:18.200 --> 17:21.431
I refuse to walk round all day
with Petersen's arm.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.272
You know what he was like.
God knows where this arm has been.

17:25.359 --> 17:28.477
Ah! What's he doing?

17:29.600 --> 17:32.398
Beats me, Arnie,
Seems to have a mind of its own,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.591
Tell him to stop it.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.355
What is this? A cabaret?
Entertainment while you eat?

17:43.440 --> 17:45.396
No... no... no...

17:45.480 --> 17:48.756
Can you place bets? My bet is on this arm.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.993
Ahhh!

17:54.680 --> 17:58.753
Holly, you're handsome and delicious.
Please tell him to stop.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.434
All right, Give me a couple of seconds,

18:01.560 --> 18:04.791
Ha! I've outwitted him.
He's given up. Look, he's given up.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.392
Oooooh!

18:11.440 --> 18:14.716
There, done it, Just in time,

18:14.880 --> 18:18.873
Hey! That was good. You should've
finished on a song, to be perfect.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.590
I hate everything.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.234
Where is Lister, the little worm?

18:45.480 --> 18:49.189
Lister? Listie... Listie... Wistie, Lister?

18:49.280 --> 18:54.559
I know you're here, Lister.
You're always here, Sunday afternoons.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.994
What are you two doing here?
Skutters don't have time off.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.877
You really must think I'm stupid.
I'll deal with you two later.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.555
You're serious about this, aren't you?

19:36.640 --> 19:39.108
- Go away, I'm busy.
- Off.

19:39.920 --> 19:44.630
You seriously believe a fungus like you
has the stuff to be an officer?

19:44.720 --> 19:48.349
You've the brains of diarrhoea
and the breeding of a maggot.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.594
What are you writing on?
The inside of a chocolate wrapper!

19:53.680 --> 19:56.433
Where's your loose-leaf file?

19:56.520 --> 20:00.229
Your pencils, your protractor
and your hole reinforcers?

20:00.320 --> 20:02.993
I'm going to pass this exam by knowing things.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.038
- OK. What's a porous circuit?
- I don't know.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.588
- How do you calculate acceleration?
- I don't know.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.354
This is sad. What's Boyle's Fourth Law?

20:11.440 --> 20:16.355
- Don't eat greasy food?
- These are basic precepts.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.510
How will you pass the engineering exam?

20:18.680 --> 20:21.353
I don't. I expect to pass the chef's exam.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.192
Chef? You want to become a chef?

20:26.360 --> 20:28.874
Not really. I just want to be your superior.

20:30.240 --> 20:35.109
A chef? A white-hatted ponce?
That's not a real officer.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.350
It outranks you, smeg-for-brains.

20:37.440 --> 20:42.798
Lister, what's this? Learning drugs?
They're illegal, matey.

20:42.880 --> 20:48.273
I'm afraid you're in very serious,
grave, deep trouble, Lister.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.796
Where did you get them?
I want names, places and dates.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.394
Arnold Rimmer. His locker. This morning.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.829
Why worry? You'll never pass.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.230
You'll never pass, Mister Lister, sir.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.709
Practise, Rimmer, makes perfect.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.953
Question four... underline that.

21:09.640 --> 21:15.033
What does the red spectrum
tell us about quasars?

21:15.120 --> 21:19.432
Ohhhhh... I'm gonna die!

21:19.520 --> 21:21.829
I've been "fished" to death.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.878
My answer: in answering the question,

21:25.960 --> 21:29.270
"What does the red spectrum
tell us about quasars?"...

21:29.360 --> 21:33.433
Write bigger. "There are various
words that need to be defined.

21:33.520 --> 21:38.116
"What is a spectrum?
What is a red one? Why is it red?

21:38.200 --> 21:42.478
"And why is it so frequently
linked with quasars?"

21:45.160 --> 21:47.310
What the hell is a quasar?

21:48.320 --> 21:50.959
Just put a neat cross through it.
We'll do the next one.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.838
.. and I think that confidently

21:53.920 --> 21:57.117
and concisely answers the question,
"What does the... quasar".

21:57.760 --> 22:01.150
- Da-dum!
- Lister, did you make that?

22:01.240 --> 22:04.073
Yeah. It's not that good.
It was supposed to be roast beef.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.557
Do you want some, Cat?
It's got real cream and fudge in it.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.552
Oh, no, I think I'm going to have to go
and do something secret.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.952
Aaaaah! Look out! Food escape!

22:17.120 --> 22:21.272
- So, Lister, you doing all right?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

22:27.600 --> 22:32.628
Lister... Lister, all this tension
between us is stupid.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.918
There's no need for it.
You're tense and I'm tense.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.195
There's absolutely no need for it.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.874
- I'm not tense.
- Of course you're tense...

22:41.960 --> 22:45.475
You rectum-faced pygmy!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.795
There's no need for you
to be slogging your guts out.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.634
- I'm enjoying it.
- Shut up. An exam and doing well.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.995
There's absolutely no need for it.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.991
You can have the cigarettes, Pipeline 22.

22:59.160 --> 23:02.470
- I know.
- Good.

23:02.560 --> 23:06.314
The Cat betrayed me.
I don't mind. I'm delighted.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.517
What I'm saying is, there's no need
for us to be at loggerheads.

23:10.600 --> 23:14.354
- I mean, we're mates, pals.
- When?

23:14.600 --> 23:18.832
Oh, come on. Laugh, laugh,
laugh, chuckle, guffaw, giggle.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.434
- That's Rimsy and Listy.
- When?

23:21.520 --> 23:24.318
- Millions of times.
- When?

23:25.200 --> 23:28.431
Ah! Ah, how about the time

23:28.520 --> 23:31.353
your safety harness snapped
and you fell into the cargo bay?

23:31.440 --> 23:35.069
- We laughed then, didn't we?
- I cracked me spine in three places.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.398
Yes, it was hilarious. We laughed like drains.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.472
You laughed. I spent six weeks in traction.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.593
That's right. You spent the summer
walking like a croquet hoop.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.831
I laughed so hard I nearly puked.

23:49.040 --> 23:52.555
- What are you saying to me?
- I'm just saying, Lister,

23:52.640 --> 23:55.518
with times as good as those,

23:55.600 --> 23:59.639
there's no point in letting
something small and silly like this

23:59.720 --> 24:03.269
come between a friendship we've nurtured,

24:03.360 --> 24:05.999
like a small flower, petal by petal,

24:06.080 --> 24:11.074
and watched it blossom
and bloom into something special.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.116
OK. Give me Kochanski.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.395
Smeg off, dishwater breath.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.516
You won't turn me back on.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.956
What, Rimsy-wimsy-mimsy,
me bestest-ever pal?

24:21.120 --> 24:23.350
Lister, I order you not to take those exams.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.554
Black card, Rimmer.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.708
YOU are black carding ME?

24:29.880 --> 24:31.871
That's only the beginning, Rimmer.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.396
When I pass the exams
and become an officer, you'll be on latrines.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.835
You'll have the three o'clock watch every morning

24:37.920 --> 24:40.514
and I know you'll obey me, because you... you,

24:40.600 --> 24:42.795
respect all that officer smeg.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.838
If you mean I respect my superiors,
no matter who,

24:45.920 --> 24:50.311
and I obey orders blindly
and unquestionably... yes! Yes, I do.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.950
That's exactly what I mean.
Anyway, I've got to get some sleep.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.634
Hard day's revision on the morrow.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.149
You always become the thing you hate the most.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.995
Look at you, Lister... obnoxious,
ruthless, single-minded,

25:06.080 --> 25:09.629
insensitive... you're more like me than I am.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.519
Rimmer, you've forgotten the colour code.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.876
This is a black card situation -
end of conversation.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.953
"You never learn, do you?"

25:24.840 --> 25:28.628
Chef Part One Examination,
Please proceed to the Teaching Room,

25:31.200 --> 25:34.351
You're not ready for it.
You should be doing last-second revision.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.636
I am. I'm revising buns.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.477
It's obscene, missing the entire
first minute of the exam.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.718
OK, here we go.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.156
No. You can't do this to me, Lister.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.310
- Give me Kochanski.
- No.

25:51.640 --> 25:55.349
That was a lousy thing to do.
Have you no respect for the dead?

26:12.960 --> 26:16.475
- Hello, Dave.
- Aaaaaagh!

26:18.880 --> 26:22.555
I'm just doing this,
er... I'm taking, er... This is a surprise.

26:23.200 --> 26:28.433
Why didn't you tell me
how you felt about me when I was alive?

26:28.600 --> 26:32.673
Because I'm a dope and I'm a bum,
and I'm stupid, I'm an idiot

26:32.760 --> 26:35.194
and I'm hopeless and I'm useless.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.271
Sorry, but I just don't like you.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.636
Oh-ey, I'm really embarrassed now.
I don't know what to say.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.678
It's sort of pointless you doing the exam now.

26:45.760 --> 26:49.116
It's pointless me breathing in and out
if you want to know the truth.

26:49.280 --> 26:52.556
I could never love anyone like you.

26:52.640 --> 26:57.031
You might as well pack up
your pots and pans and off you go.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.272
I need a man who's going places.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.954
Up, up, up... lickety-split.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.196
So, it didn't mean anything to you, then?

27:09.640 --> 27:12.871
- What didn't?
- You know, when we...

27:13.360 --> 27:15.999
Made love on the snooker table, behind the bins.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.269
- You never told me that!
- I thought you might have noticed.

27:20.440 --> 27:23.079
Oh, yes, yes. I remember now.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.549
We've never made love. Go away, Rimmer.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.518
Look, I'm a bit out of sorts at the moment.

27:28.600 --> 27:32.718
- I'm having a woman's period.
- A woman's period?

27:32.800 --> 27:35.792
Women don't speak like that.
Give me a break.

27:35.880 --> 27:39.475
I don't know how you've done it, Rimmer,
but that is not Kochanski.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.035
It's Kochanski's body, it's Kochanski's voice.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.156
What's the difference, come on?

27:44.320 --> 27:47.153
The difference is that you're in there, urgh...

27:47.800 --> 27:50.519
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

27:50.680 --> 27:57.119
- Leave.
- I've seen something you haven't, squire.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.800
OK, Holly, swap discs.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.233
Holly, this is not my breast.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.157
I want my own nipple back.

28:14.560 --> 28:20.317
- Leave, Rimmer.
- There's no rush, Holly.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.593
Holly, are you sure these are my hips?

28:38.400 --> 28:41.278
Lister: 16912146.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.431
How did you do?

28:49.880 --> 28:52.348
How did you do?

28:53.320 --> 28:56.437
- How did you do, Lister?
- How did I do, Mister Lister, SIR?

29:01.360 --> 29:05.512
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

29:05.600 --> 29:08.956
# I'm all alone, more or less

29:09.040 --> 29:12.157
# Let me fly far away from here

29:12.240 --> 29:14.834
# Fun, fun, fun

29:14.920 --> 29:18.629
# In the sun, sun, sun

29:18.720 --> 29:22.156
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

29:22.240 --> 29:25.357
# Drinking fresh mango juice

29:25.440 --> 29:28.955
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

29:29.040 --> 29:31.679
# Fun, fun, fun

29:31.760 --> 29:35.070
# In the sun, sun, sun

29:35.160 --> 29:38.357
# Fun, fun, fun

29:38.440 --> 29:42.035
# In the sun, sun, sun #
