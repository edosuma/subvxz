<i>"When the gods wish to punish us,</i>

01:10.083 --> 01:11.500
<i>Oscar Wilde wrote that.</i>

01:12.791 --> 01:14.041
<i>We didn't read that book.</i>

01:16.458 --> 01:17.916
<i>Maybe we should have.</i>

01:25.458 --> 01:29.375
<i>Harlow, Maine, is really not a town</i>
<i>but a village and still is,</i>

01:29.458 --> 01:30.875
<i>although I've moved away.</i>

01:31.458 --> 01:34.166
<i>There's a six-room elementary</i>
<i>and middle school house.</i>

01:35.250 --> 01:37.000
<i>There's Howie's Market,</i>

01:37.083 --> 01:40.000
<i>where they sell groceries</i>
<i>and Red Devil lotto tickets.</i>

01:42.458 --> 01:45.416
<i>Gates Falls is the next town over</i>
<i>and bigger.</i>

01:45.916 --> 01:48.333
<i>It has my dad's</i>
<i>favorite restaurant, Mondello's.</i>

01:49.916 --> 01:52.666
<i>And we'd go there</i>
<i>whenever he won salesman of the month,</i>

01:53.166 --> 01:57.083
<i>which used to be often</i>
<i>but now, not so much</i>

01:57.916 --> 01:59.208
<i>since Mom died.</i>

02:02.500 --> 02:05.125
<i>Harlow also has Castle Lake</i>
<i>and the Ledges,</i>

02:05.208 --> 02:07.666
<i>where the pine needles</i>
<i>give way to bare rock,</i>

02:07.750 --> 02:09.708
<i>which is New England's ultimate truth.</i>

02:11.083 --> 02:13.583
<i>But before I talk about</i>
<i>the big-money lottery ticket,</i>

02:13.666 --> 02:17.750
<i>the shit show with Kenny Yankovich,</i>
<i>and everyone dying,</i>

02:17.833 --> 02:20.958
<i>I should tell you about how I happened</i>
<i>to go to work for Mr. Harrigan.</i>

02:21.041 --> 02:22.458
<i>It was because of church.</i>

02:58.000 --> 03:01.333
Second Samuel chapter 1, verses 19 and 20.

03:01.416 --> 03:04.416
"The beauty of Israel
is slain upon the high places."

03:04.500 --> 03:06.000
"How are the mighty fallen!"

03:06.708 --> 03:08.083
"Tell it not in Gath,

03:10.750 --> 03:13.000
"Lest the daughters
of the Philistines rejoice."

03:13.083 --> 03:16.416
"Lest the daughters
of the uncircumcised triumph."

03:24.958 --> 03:26.208
Thank you, Craig.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.125
Pretty nice, huh?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.416
I'm so glad you're here this morning…

03:35.500 --> 03:37.791
<i>Since that day, I've wondered</i>

03:38.541 --> 03:39.500
<i>what if…</i>

03:41.708 --> 03:42.875
<i>and why me.</i>

03:47.666 --> 03:49.750
<i>-Why did he choose me?</i>

03:52.541 --> 03:56.416
<i>John Harrigan was the richest guy</i>
<i>in Maine. A billionaire.</i>

03:56.500 --> 03:59.000
I wonder if I can have a word
with your son.

03:59.666 --> 04:01.250
<i>His eyes were failing,</i>

04:01.333 --> 04:03.833
<i>and he wanted to hire someone</i>
<i>to read books to him.</i>

04:04.875 --> 04:07.833
<i>There were other kids,</i>
<i>older kids, better readers.</i>

04:09.125 --> 04:12.291
<i>Was it because he knew</i>
<i>five dollars an hour would be attractive</i>

04:12.375 --> 04:15.583
<i>to a boy looking for any chance</i>
<i>to get out of a lonely house?</i>

04:17.375 --> 04:18.583
<i>Or something else,</i>

04:20.541 --> 04:22.208
<i>something I'd have to discover?</i>

05:02.333 --> 05:03.500
Hi, my name is--

05:03.583 --> 05:04.875
I know who you are.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.833
All the way back and to the right.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.833
"…for passion alone is awake to it."

06:04.916 --> 06:07.583
"And when passion is dead or absent,

06:07.666 --> 06:11.250
then the magnificent throb of beauty
is incomprehensible

06:11.333 --> 06:12.875
and even a little despicable."

06:13.666 --> 06:18.416
"Warm, live beauty of contact,
so much deeper than the beauty of wisdom."

06:25.125 --> 06:26.833
<i>"'What is money, after all?'"</i>

06:26.916 --> 06:29.250

06:29.333 --> 06:32.916
<i>"Mr. Dombey drew his chair back</i>
<i>to its former place</i>

06:33.000 --> 06:34.666
<i>and patted him on the head."</i>

06:36.708 --> 06:39.791
"'You'll know better by and by,
my man,' he said."

06:40.500 --> 06:43.125
"'Money, Paul, can do anything.'"

07:02.291 --> 07:03.916
<i>As much as I missed her,</i>

07:04.416 --> 07:06.375
<i>my father missed her even more.</i>

07:09.000 --> 07:14.916
<i>Without her around,</i>
<i>he seemed sad and hollow.</i>

07:20.750 --> 07:22.791
<i>I had this weird kid thing.</i>

07:23.583 --> 07:26.708
<i>Like, somehow,</i>
<i>my mom's death was my fault.</i>

07:27.708 --> 07:29.541
<i>That I was responsible for it.</i>

07:30.791 --> 07:31.875
<i>That I controlled it.</i>

07:32.500 --> 07:33.916
<i>And if I controlled it…</i>

07:36.291 --> 07:37.500
<i>I could have stopped it.</i>

08:10.458 --> 08:13.166
-What are you doing?
-Um, it's nothing, sorry.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.208
It doesn't concern you.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.375
Do you have a question?

08:18.750 --> 08:20.541
If you do, I will answer it.

08:21.791 --> 08:23.250
What's in the closet?

08:24.458 --> 08:25.750
Secrets.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.541
Terrible secrets.

08:31.958 --> 08:36.333
"Did he live his life again
in every detail of desire, temptation,

08:36.416 --> 08:39.791
and surrender during that supreme moment
of complete knowledge?"

08:39.875 --> 08:43.416
"He cried in a whisper at some image,
at some vision."

08:44.125 --> 08:45.458
"He cried out twice."

08:46.041 --> 08:48.208
"A cry that was no more than a breath."

08:48.708 --> 08:51.375
"'The horror. The horror.'"

08:52.000 --> 08:53.291
"'The horror.'"

08:54.750 --> 08:56.000
"'The horror.'"

08:56.750 --> 08:59.333
Do you understand what you just read?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.958
Do you understand what Conrad is saying?

09:04.958 --> 09:06.000
I think I do.

09:08.875 --> 09:09.958
Mm.

09:10.791 --> 09:12.750
It is payday, Craig.

09:15.708 --> 09:16.875
Thank you.

09:17.666 --> 09:19.333
Do you ever read when I'm not here?

09:21.541 --> 09:23.083
Yes, I read this.

09:24.416 --> 09:25.916
Aren't they kinda boring?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
"Boring"?

09:27.083 --> 09:30.333
I find finance exhilarating.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.250
Do you remember <i>Dombey and Son?</i>

09:33.333 --> 09:36.083
Second book we read. I read.

09:36.166 --> 09:42.333
Dombey was trying to help his son
understand that the true value of money

09:42.416 --> 09:44.375
is not measured in worth.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.750
The true value of money

09:47.791 --> 09:49.458
is measured in power.

09:49.541 --> 09:52.208
But the boy, Paul, he asked,

09:52.291 --> 09:54.958
"Why didn't money save my mama?"
or something.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.000
And he asked his father
if money was cruel.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.541
It can be cruel if used properly.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.208
<i>John Harrigan wasn't well-liked.</i>

10:25.708 --> 10:28.833
<i>He'd never been married,</i>
<i>never had children,</i>

10:29.458 --> 10:32.291
<i>and had no connection</i>
<i>to whatever family he had left.</i>

10:34.375 --> 10:36.625
<i>Maybe that's why he seemed so lonely.</i>

10:39.000 --> 10:41.916
<i>Maybe he took that loneliness</i>
<i>out on others.</i>

10:45.083 --> 10:46.916
<i>It was a feeling I understood.</i>

10:57.541 --> 11:00.458
You know, your mom thought
that playing the lotto was gambling.

11:00.541 --> 11:03.958
If she knew I was letting you work
with Harrigan and scratching Red Devils,

11:04.041 --> 11:05.750
she'd roll over in her grave.

11:09.583 --> 11:10.708
All right. Go ahead.

11:12.583 --> 11:14.791
-Where you going?
-Gonna use my lucky dime.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.166
<i>That was the first.</i>

11:22.250 --> 11:23.750
<i>But from that day on,</i>

11:23.833 --> 11:27.000
<i>I could count on four envelopes</i>
<i>hand-addressed to me each year.</i>

11:27.875 --> 11:30.958
<i>Valentine's Day, my birthday in September,</i>

11:31.041 --> 11:33.500
<i>Thanksgiving, and Christmas.</i>

11:42.500 --> 11:43.333
Zilch.

11:43.416 --> 11:46.833
He's a cheapster. Pays you cheap wages.
Gives you a cheap bonus.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.166
A one-dollar Red Devil ticket
from Howie's?

11:53.250 --> 11:58.041
So, what you said earlier about Mom,
what does that really mean?

11:58.125 --> 11:59.000
What?

11:59.083 --> 12:00.791
Roll over in your grave.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.166
Oh, um…

12:03.250 --> 12:05.083
It's just an old saying. Um…

12:05.833 --> 12:08.583
I guess it just means
once a person has been laid to rest,

12:08.666 --> 12:11.500
they shouldn't worry
about things above ground

12:12.083 --> 12:13.625
in the living world.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.333
Okay.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.666
<i> "'All right, kids,'</i>
<i>Rocky said into the microphone."</i>

12:22.750 --> 12:25.083
<i>"'A little sprint</i>
<i>before the rest of the period.'"</i>

12:25.166 --> 12:26.791
<i>"'Give,'" he said to the orchestra,</i>

12:26.875 --> 12:29.583
clapping his hands together
and stamping on the platform,

12:29.666 --> 12:31.250
keeping time to the music."

12:31.333 --> 12:34.125
"In a moment, the customers
were clapping their hands together

12:34.208 --> 12:35.333
and stamping too."

12:35.416 --> 12:38.250
"We were all milling around
in the middle of the floor,

12:38.333 --> 12:40.625
all of us watching
the minute hand of the clock,

12:40.708 --> 12:43.791
when suddenly,
Kid Kamm, of couple number 18,

12:43.875 --> 12:46.083
began slapping his partner on the cheek."

12:46.166 --> 12:48.458
"He was holding her up with his left hand,

12:48.541 --> 12:51.708
slapping her backwards and forwards
with his right hand."

12:51.791 --> 12:55.791
"But she did not respond.
She was dead to the world."

12:55.875 --> 12:57.875
"She gurgled a couple of times…"

12:57.958 --> 12:59.250
<i>"…and then slid to the floor."</i>

12:59.333 --> 13:00.875
"The floor judge blew his whistle,

13:00.958 --> 13:03.333
and all the customers
jumped to their feet, excited."

13:03.833 --> 13:06.541
"Customers at a marathon dance
do not have to be prepared--"

13:06.625 --> 13:07.583
That's enough.

13:13.458 --> 13:16.416
The first time we read this,
I didn't quite understand the title.

13:18.208 --> 13:20.208
And what does it mean to you now?

13:20.291 --> 13:25.541
Um, that if horses in pain
can be put out of their misery,

13:26.250 --> 13:28.375
why can't humans be
afforded the same gift?

13:31.166 --> 13:32.750
The gift of death.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.250
To nevermore feel pain

13:40.333 --> 13:42.666
or fret

13:43.833 --> 13:45.125
or worry.

13:51.375 --> 13:54.458
<i>I'd been reading to him</i>
<i>three times a week for five years</i>

13:54.541 --> 13:55.666
<i>and only missed once</i>

13:55.750 --> 13:57.750
<i>when I had an achy spring flu.</i>

13:57.833 --> 14:00.625
<i>I felt bad about missing</i>
<i>because I'd begun to wonder</i>

14:00.708 --> 14:03.333
<i>if our time together</i>
<i>was the high point of his week,</i>

14:03.833 --> 14:07.083
<i>giving him something to look forward to,</i>
<i>something to live for.</i>

<i>As a rite of passage,</i>
<i>all Harlow kids</i>

14:25.375 --> 14:28.583
<i>go to Gates Falls for high school</i>
<i>since Harlow doesn't have one.</i>

<i>Billy Ueberroth's older brother,</i>
<i>Mike, or U-Boat, as everybody called him…</i>

14:35.083 --> 14:38.250
<i>…had already been in the deep end,</i>
<i>came out unscathed,</i>

14:38.333 --> 14:41.750
<i>and had agreed to show us the ropes</i>
<i>if we paid him.</i>

15:00.708 --> 15:01.666
Sweet.

15:02.958 --> 15:06.833
Boys and girls, time to show you
where the bodies are buried.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.250
And stop.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.500
Give me your eyes and ears.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.000
Dangers lie ahead.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.791
Now on your left…

15:17.000 --> 15:19.083
Don't stare. Don't venture over there

15:19.166 --> 15:22.583
unless you're looking for a black eye,
lung cancer, or a tattoo.

15:23.583 --> 15:26.416
You see, hazing is forbidden
at Gates Falls High,

15:26.500 --> 15:28.541
but that doesn't mean it don't happen.

15:30.125 --> 15:33.833
You're gonna have to steel yourself.
Acquire a cold eye and a mean look.

15:33.916 --> 15:36.000
Don't take any shit

15:36.083 --> 15:39.250
or your years here will be hell.
It's just like prison.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.166
-Do your time under the radar.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.416
Thanks, U-Boat!

15:45.500 --> 15:47.916
And don't think all this
doesn't apply to you, Margie.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.625
Those senior girls are mean as pythons.

15:50.708 --> 15:51.916
They don't strike at once

15:52.000 --> 15:55.375
but enjoy squeezing the life out of you
over the course of the year.

15:55.458 --> 15:56.916
Don't ever go in there.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.666
Last stop on the tour.

16:02.416 --> 16:05.333
The cafeteria.
This is where the popular kids hang out.

16:05.416 --> 16:06.625
They all have smartphones.

16:06.708 --> 16:10.166
Motorola Razer.
Samsung table over there in the corner.

16:12.041 --> 16:14.208
And that is the Apple table.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.250
What…

16:15.333 --> 16:17.333
iPhones just came out.
How did they get them?

16:17.416 --> 16:20.458
Because they're the popular kids.

16:20.541 --> 16:22.250
We gotta get phones.

16:24.916 --> 16:26.458
<i>When you grow up in a small town</i>

<i>and are suddenly exposed</i>

16:29.500 --> 16:31.250
<i>your universe expands.</i>

16:31.333 --> 16:34.083
<i>You see strange and different faces.</i>

16:34.166 --> 16:35.708
<i>Some of them are friendly,</i>

16:37.041 --> 16:40.291
<i>but others, sometimes others</i>

16:40.375 --> 16:42.500
<i>to not like you and for no reason.</i>

16:42.583 --> 16:46.583
Hey! How you doing?
I saw you earlier, Short Bus.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.708
Take it.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.000
Look inside.

16:53.958 --> 16:54.958
Shoe polish?

16:55.041 --> 16:57.958
Every freshman shines.
You're gonna shine mine on the shitter.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.666
-I have to get to class.
-No, not until you shine my boots.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.458
-No.
-No is a mistake you don't wanna make.

17:03.541 --> 17:05.958
Shine my boots,
or I feed this can of polish to you.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.500
Boys.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.000
Is there a problem here?

17:09.083 --> 17:10.583
No. All good.

17:11.750 --> 17:15.125
What's in the bag? It wouldn't happen
to be a hazing kit, would it?

17:15.208 --> 17:16.250
No.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.958
-I gotta get to class.
-Wait.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.916
-What's your name?
-Um, Craig.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.375
What's in the bag, Craig?

17:25.458 --> 17:26.458
Um…

17:27.083 --> 17:28.083
It's…

17:28.833 --> 17:30.083
half a sandwich.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.208
He was asking me if I wanted it.

17:35.375 --> 17:36.458
Hmm.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.125
Okay.

17:42.916 --> 17:44.083
You're gonna regret this.

17:45.791 --> 17:47.875
I just saved your ass.
You should be saying thank you.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.000
Fuck your thanks, new boy.

17:49.083 --> 17:52.125
-You don't know me. What did I do to you?
-You tried to show me up.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.166
You just should've shined, Short Bus.

17:57.416 --> 17:58.791
You should've shined.

18:07.666 --> 18:09.291
Hey, there he is.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.000
First day of high school. How was it?

18:13.083 --> 18:14.125
Good.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.583
That's it? Just good?

18:17.916 --> 18:19.708
Okay, it was great.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.625
You have, uh, all the right supplies?

18:25.083 --> 18:26.041
Yeah.

18:26.583 --> 18:30.458
-What about your teachers? You like 'em?
-Good, Dad. It's all good. Okay?

18:31.750 --> 18:32.750
Yeah, okay.

18:34.375 --> 18:37.166
Well, if you… you need anything, just, uh…

18:37.791 --> 18:38.916
All right.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.625
Dad.

18:43.708 --> 18:44.708
Yeah.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.541
Can I get a cell phone?

18:51.166 --> 18:52.791
What do you need a cell phone for?

18:52.875 --> 18:57.583
For instance, I needed help
or I needed to call 911.

18:58.875 --> 19:02.125
We live in a town so small,
you can shout, and they'll show up.

19:04.833 --> 19:05.916
Okay.

19:08.833 --> 19:12.833
"Jurgis would find out these things
for himself if he stayed long enough."

19:12.916 --> 19:15.541
"It was the men
who had to do all the dirty jobs,

19:16.041 --> 19:18.000
and so there was no deceiving them."

19:18.083 --> 19:21.208
"And they caught the spirit of the place
and did like all the rest."

19:21.291 --> 19:22.750
"Jurgis had come there

19:22.833 --> 19:25.250
and thought he was going
to make himself useful, rise,

19:25.333 --> 19:27.166
and become a skilled man,

19:27.250 --> 19:29.458
but he would soon find out his error,

19:29.541 --> 19:32.250
for nobody rose in Packingtown
by doing good work.<i>"</i>

19:32.333 --> 19:33.333
Enough! E--

19:35.916 --> 19:42.375
I had forgotten how much I despised
that socialist claptrap.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.708
So, you think that Sinclair
was wrong and that you can get ahead

19:45.791 --> 19:48.416
by doing good work
and following the rules?

19:48.500 --> 19:50.833
Craig, Craig, Craig.

19:50.916 --> 19:52.583
Don't misunderstand.

19:52.666 --> 19:54.666
I admire hard work.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.083
I love smart work.

19:57.166 --> 20:00.958
You have to be
fiercely competitive to survive.

20:01.041 --> 20:04.041
To be first, you have to be bold.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.958
You have to be ruthless.

20:07.041 --> 20:09.041
Don't ask for what you need.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.458
Ask for-- No, no! Don't ask.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.791
Demand what you want.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.791
-<i>Mr. Harrigan.</i>
-<i>Yes?</i>

20:23.416 --> 20:27.541
In your life,
has anyone ever tried to bully you

20:27.625 --> 20:30.583
or take advantage of you?

20:30.666 --> 20:32.458
At work, I mean.

20:32.541 --> 20:35.625
Every single day.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.541
And how'd you deal with that?

20:40.166 --> 20:41.333
Harshly.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.666
Look at that.

21:05.583 --> 21:06.583
Wow!

21:08.208 --> 21:09.333
That is…

21:10.708 --> 21:14.416
Huh? I'll… I'll wear it
next time we go to Mondello's.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.208
Hey, uh, you got a couple too.

21:17.291 --> 21:20.458
Open the small one first.
Save mine for last.

21:21.041 --> 21:21.875
Mr. Harrigan.

21:21.958 --> 21:23.875
-Gosh, I wonder what it could be.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.875
Surprise.

21:27.958 --> 21:29.458
-Be right back.
-Yeah.

21:39.041 --> 21:39.875
I won!

21:39.958 --> 21:43.125
-Oh, really? How much?
-You're not gonna believe it.

21:43.750 --> 21:44.625
A million.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.041
$3,000!

21:51.291 --> 21:53.416
That's… that… that's a winner.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.958
That… that's gonna be
a tough gift to beat.

21:57.041 --> 21:59.166
Um, maybe you should've opened mine first.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.458
Um…

22:08.875 --> 22:10.541
-Yeah.
-Dad.

22:10.625 --> 22:11.916
Hey.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.541
You're welcome, son.

22:16.958 --> 22:21.083
The girl at the store helped me out.
It's all set up, charged, ready to go.

22:22.458 --> 22:23.666
Who you gonna call first?

22:23.750 --> 22:24.875
Mm-mmm.

22:33.291 --> 22:34.208
Hello?

22:34.291 --> 22:36.041
<i>Merry Christmas, Mr. Harrigan.</i>

22:36.125 --> 22:37.666
Craig?
<i>-It's Craig, yeah.</i>

22:37.750 --> 22:41.458
Where are you? It sounds like
you're on the other side of the moon.

22:41.541 --> 22:43.750
I'm actually on my cell phone.

22:43.833 --> 22:46.458
Oh no. They're filled with radiation.

22:46.541 --> 22:47.666
<i>How may I help?</i>

22:47.750 --> 22:51.833
I was just calling to tell you
that your gift, the scratch-off, I won.

22:51.916 --> 22:53.125
I won $3,000.

22:53.208 --> 22:54.375
Oh, good.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.666
Well, one of those things
finally paid off.

22:57.750 --> 22:58.666
Thank you.

22:59.166 --> 23:01.541
Um, it was nice of you to give it to me.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.458
It was nothing, you know? Um…

23:03.541 --> 23:05.916
<i>I… I hand them out to friends.</i>

23:07.416 --> 23:08.708
Is that all, Craig?

23:08.791 --> 23:09.958
Yeah, I suppose so.

23:10.041 --> 23:11.291
Merry Christmas.

23:11.916 --> 23:12.916
All right. Merry…

23:22.625 --> 23:25.500
Man, being back
after a holiday sucks.

23:25.583 --> 23:28.041
-What's your hurry, Craig?
-Yeah, where are you going?

23:28.916 --> 23:30.000
What?

23:30.500 --> 23:32.250
-You're shitting me!
-No.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.250
No.

23:51.083 --> 23:54.833
<i>Margie, Billy, and U-Boat</i>
<i>all got phones shortly thereafter,</i>

23:54.916 --> 23:59.000
<i>though I had the only iPhone,</i>
<i>and Billy and U-Boat had to share a Razer.</i>

24:27.750 --> 24:28.875
Thanks.

24:30.166 --> 24:34.500
Craig, there's something
I've been meaning to speak with you about.

24:37.083 --> 24:41.083
We've had this arrangement
for a long, long time.

24:41.708 --> 24:45.708
And it strikes me that
you are a far different person now

24:46.416 --> 24:49.000
from who you were when we started.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.750
My question is,

24:51.833 --> 24:54.208
why do you continue to come here?

24:54.708 --> 24:55.916
Do you want me to stop?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.291
No, no, no.

24:57.375 --> 24:59.666
Then, what?

24:59.750 --> 25:03.208
Surely there are sports clubs and girls

25:03.291 --> 25:05.291
who could better occupy your time.

25:05.375 --> 25:08.458
And yet, here you are three days a week.

25:09.625 --> 25:10.458
Why?

25:11.208 --> 25:14.500
Is it out of some sense of obligation?

25:14.583 --> 25:15.875
Not at all. No.

25:15.958 --> 25:17.291
Well, then, why?

25:19.541 --> 25:21.250
Because I enjoy our time together.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.125
Why?

25:30.041 --> 25:31.625
I come here because I…

25:33.500 --> 25:35.291
I like the smell of your books.

25:36.458 --> 25:41.125
I come here because I love our talks.
I come here because, when I read out loud,

25:41.208 --> 25:44.875
it gives me a sense of power
that I don't have outside of this room.

25:48.708 --> 25:50.208
I come here because I want to.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.666
I'll see you Thursday.

26:18.708 --> 26:20.375
I know what I wanna do
with the lotto money.

26:20.458 --> 26:23.875
That money is going into the college fund
like we agreed.

26:23.958 --> 26:26.833
Well, you said most of it
was going into the college fund.

26:26.916 --> 26:28.458
How often do I buy things?

26:33.666 --> 26:34.500
Almost never.

26:34.583 --> 26:37.041
Well, I know what I wanna do
with the rest of it.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.666
-Afternoon, Pete.
-Afternoon.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.500
-Hi, Edna.
-Hello, boy.

26:49.583 --> 26:50.666
Thank you.

26:54.291 --> 26:55.416
There you are.

26:55.916 --> 26:59.458
-Mr. Harrigan, I brought you something.
-I don't need anything.

27:09.083 --> 27:10.083
Thank you.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.375
I appreciate the sentiment.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.333
But, no.

27:15.583 --> 27:18.291
-I suggest you give this to your father.
-He told me you'd say that.

27:19.083 --> 27:20.333
A wise man, he.

27:21.708 --> 27:25.208
Henry David Thoreau said,

27:25.291 --> 27:30.166
"We don't own things. Things own us."

27:30.250 --> 27:31.791
I don't have a television

27:31.875 --> 27:36.083
because if I did,
I would spend my time watching it.

27:36.166 --> 27:39.750
I have a radio in the car,
but I don't have a radio in the house,

27:39.833 --> 27:44.000
even though I like a bit of
country and western from time to time.

27:44.541 --> 27:48.458
And if I had that,
I would waste more time.

27:50.791 --> 27:52.041
-Okay, let me just--
-No, no, no.

27:52.125 --> 27:56.791
I'm beginning to wish that
that scratch ticket had not been a winner.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.208
-You see these?
-Mm-hmm.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.125
These are called icons.

28:02.833 --> 28:05.291
This one is for the stock market.

28:05.375 --> 28:08.708
I have a subscription
to the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>

28:08.791 --> 28:11.458
Right, but the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
can't do this.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.583
-Are those numbers in real time?
-Yup.

28:18.666 --> 28:22.500
Well, they might be
a minute or two behind, I guess.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.250
I'll be darned.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.916
I mean, it's like having
your own stock ticker,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.666
like the magnates
used to have in their mansions.

28:32.500 --> 28:36.083
Yeah. And if you wanna
read the <i>Journal </i>or <i>Forbes</i>

28:36.166 --> 28:38.291
or… or anything like that, you can.

28:40.500 --> 28:44.958
"Barton Instruments
announces closings."

28:53.125 --> 28:54.083
It's not in here.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.958
'Cause that's yesterday's.

28:56.041 --> 29:01.500
You get it a day late. Everyone does.
But this, this is today's.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.208
I've been arrogant, Craig.

29:06.083 --> 29:08.416
I am going to keep this, after all.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.666
For a while anyway.

29:09.750 --> 29:10.625
I'm glad.

29:10.708 --> 29:13.291
Could you bring me the phone
from the desk?

29:13.375 --> 29:16.000
Well, you can use this to call.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.208
-Yes?
-Yeah.

29:17.291 --> 29:18.708
It's what it's mostly for.

29:18.791 --> 29:21.583
You just dial the number that you want.
Touch it with your fingers.

29:21.666 --> 29:23.708
-And you have four bars.
-"Bars"?

29:23.791 --> 29:26.375
'Cause of the new cell tower. Never mind.

29:26.458 --> 29:28.708
-Is that better?
-Yeah, that's good.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.250
Chick.

29:36.416 --> 29:37.875
It's John Harrigan.

29:37.958 --> 29:40.250
I have a cell phone now.

29:40.333 --> 29:43.166
I want to make an adjustment
to my portfolio.

29:43.750 --> 29:44.666
Yes.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.250
Well? Did he like it?

29:49.333 --> 29:50.166
No.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.333
I warned you.

29:54.750 --> 29:55.583
He loved it.

30:02.291 --> 30:04.000
And I can set an alarm…

30:04.083 --> 30:07.666
<i>Each visit, before I read,</i>
<i>I'd teach him new ways to use his phone.</i>

30:07.750 --> 30:09.708
<i>I introduced him to the Internet,</i>

30:09.791 --> 30:11.625
<i>to Yahoo!, and Google.</i>

30:11.708 --> 30:14.416
<i>Taught him how to text,</i>
<i>how to create a voice mail…</i>

30:15.625 --> 30:17.833
I'm not answering my phone now.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.708
I will call you back
if it seems appropriate.

30:21.791 --> 30:22.625
All right?

30:24.208 --> 30:26.666
I'm not answering my phone now.

30:26.750 --> 30:29.458
I will call you back
if it seems appropriate.

30:29.541 --> 30:32.458
-I'm not sure I'd want you to call back.
-Perfect.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.875
<i>…and even how</i>
<i>to personalize his phone.</i>

30:35.958 --> 30:38.250
-Let's give you a handle.
-Handle?

30:38.333 --> 30:41.208
No. A handle's like a nickname.

30:41.291 --> 30:45.416
So when you call me or text me,
that's the name that pops up on my phone.

30:45.500 --> 30:48.000
You want me to give me a nickname?

30:48.083 --> 30:50.875
Maybe it could be something
that other people call you. Here.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.708
Newspapers used to call me this.

30:54.791 --> 30:57.166
It was not meant as a compliment.

31:01.708 --> 31:04.916
Pirate King. Wicked.
Has anyone called you yet?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.791
No. Sales pitches and wrong numbers.

31:07.875 --> 31:11.250
I could not abide the sound
of that xylophone.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.041
Let's give you another ringtone.

31:15.833 --> 31:16.666
Uh…

31:18.041 --> 31:19.375
-Better?
-Yeah, better.

31:19.458 --> 31:21.750
-I still won't answer it.
-Even if it's me?

31:22.541 --> 31:23.750
How would I know?

31:23.833 --> 31:26.416
-You like country and western, right?
-I do.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.250
-What's your favorite song?
-There are so many.

31:31.250 --> 31:34.458
Tammy Wynette. "Stand By Your Man."

31:36.458 --> 31:37.833
Ringtones.

31:37.916 --> 31:39.916
This one?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.375
Yeah. That's lovely.

31:42.458 --> 31:43.708
Listen to it.

31:45.291 --> 31:47.041
I can do this.

31:49.250 --> 31:52.208
There. "Stand By Your Man."
Okay. Here you go.

31:53.166 --> 31:55.916
Okay. Now call me.
I'm in your favorites there.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.750
Yeah. Now we know
when the other is calling.

32:03.833 --> 32:05.541
Yes. Good.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.291
All right. What should we read today?

32:14.458 --> 32:15.333
You all right?

32:16.041 --> 32:17.041
No.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.833
No. There's something troubling me.

32:19.916 --> 32:21.500
Maybe you can explain it.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
I've been reading articles
on this phone for a month now.

32:28.458 --> 32:29.833
And they've all been free.

32:30.875 --> 32:32.125
-Yeah?
-No.

32:32.208 --> 32:36.083
I'm reading something for free
that people pay good money for.

32:36.166 --> 32:37.375
It's great, right?

32:37.458 --> 32:38.375
No, it's not!

32:38.958 --> 32:40.625
Giving information away

32:40.708 --> 32:46.708
runs counter to everything I understand
about successful business practices.

32:46.791 --> 32:50.833
The World Wide Web
is like a broken water main,

32:50.916 --> 32:54.958
but instead of water,
it's spewing information every which way.

32:55.041 --> 32:57.958
I don't understand.
Is it a come-on or what?

32:58.458 --> 32:59.875
I'm asking, Craig.

33:01.333 --> 33:03.875
Kind of like the Fryeburg Fair,

33:03.958 --> 33:06.916
where the first game is usually free.

33:08.708 --> 33:11.083
And we're still on the first game.

33:11.791 --> 33:13.250
Fryeburg Fair.

33:14.208 --> 33:18.375
And there are no advertisements
on these sites.

33:18.958 --> 33:22.375
Ads are the lifeblood of newspapers.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.291
How will they survive?

33:25.291 --> 33:27.291
I don't think this is a come-on.

33:27.791 --> 33:29.666
I think it's a gateway drug.

33:30.250 --> 33:32.000
I've already noticed

33:32.083 --> 33:35.958
that my Google search responses
are on the side of financial information.

33:36.041 --> 33:38.458
It knows what I want.

33:38.541 --> 33:40.875
What's gonna happen
when they close the water main?

33:40.958 --> 33:42.041
No more freebies.

33:42.125 --> 33:46.208
Oh, and false information
becomes common and accepted as true.

33:46.791 --> 33:50.291
And what happens
when they start using this

33:50.375 --> 33:52.916
to spread more nonsense
than is already out there?

33:53.000 --> 33:56.541
Newspapers, journalists, politicians…

33:56.625 --> 34:00.291
All of us need to be
very frightened by this gizmo.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.791
-Hmm.

34:09.875 --> 34:11.083
I'll go help Pete.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.833
<i>He stared at his phone</i>
<i>like it was a Magic 8 Ball.</i>

34:27.375 --> 34:30.000
<i>And on that day, in a matter of seconds,</i>

34:30.083 --> 34:32.208
<i>Mr. Harrigan predicted the future.</i>

34:32.833 --> 34:37.583
<i>The future of the Internet,</i>
<i>the future of news, of fake news,</i>

34:37.666 --> 34:40.541
<i>social media, of paywalls and spam,</i>

34:40.625 --> 34:44.916
<i>of Julian Assange</i>
<i>and Edward Snowden, and the world.</i>

34:49.291 --> 34:50.500
Good morning, Craig.

34:51.041 --> 34:52.708
Oh, good morning, Ms. Hart.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.833
-Is that a smartphone?

35:15.916 --> 35:17.583
Yes, it's an iPhone.

35:18.666 --> 35:20.875
Okay, I see you, rich kid.

35:22.833 --> 35:24.833
-Do you wanna see mine?
-Sure.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.291
It's really cool. It's got this huge…

35:28.375 --> 35:29.333
Oh…

35:30.708 --> 35:32.333
Oh, that's right. I don't have one.

35:32.958 --> 35:33.791
Um…

35:34.958 --> 35:35.875
Can I see yours?

35:39.041 --> 35:41.041
Um, okay.

35:44.541 --> 35:45.500
Thank you.

35:48.791 --> 35:49.791
Whoa.

35:51.291 --> 35:52.208
Neat.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.208
Heads up.

35:58.583 --> 36:00.916
<i>"But that is the beginning</i>
<i>of a new story."</i>

36:01.000 --> 36:04.666
"The story of the gradual renewal
of a man."

36:04.750 --> 36:07.083
"The story of his gradual regeneration,

36:07.166 --> 36:09.583
of his passing
from one world into another,

36:09.666 --> 36:12.666
of his initiation
into a new unknown life."

36:13.291 --> 36:18.083
"That might be the subject of a new story,
but our present story is ended."

36:23.833 --> 36:25.291
Apologies.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.750
Get thee behind me, Satan.

36:28.375 --> 36:29.250
Well done.

36:29.333 --> 36:33.000
I do enjoy the occasional
bleak Russian novel.

36:35.541 --> 36:40.041
Would you go in the center drawer
of my desk and retrieve my checkbook?

36:40.625 --> 36:41.583
Thank you.

36:44.791 --> 36:45.625
Find it?

36:50.625 --> 36:51.541
Thank you.

36:52.041 --> 36:54.416
That's new. The tank.
Is everything okay?

36:54.500 --> 36:57.041
So I use it at night mostly.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.875
There's something
I always wanted to ask you.

37:01.375 --> 37:02.416
Mm.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.083
Why did you move here?

37:06.875 --> 37:07.750
To Harlow?

37:08.708 --> 37:09.833
You could live anywhere.

37:09.916 --> 37:12.750
As someone who's lived in the city
his entire life,

37:13.583 --> 37:16.416
I wanted to live in the country.

37:16.500 --> 37:21.041
I looked at many places,
and finally, I settled here.

37:21.125 --> 37:22.416
There are views,

37:23.041 --> 37:25.000
but none of them are spectacular.

37:25.833 --> 37:28.791
Spectacular views attract people.

37:29.666 --> 37:32.083
And I do not much like people.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.625
No one asks things of me.

37:46.416 --> 37:47.958
I wanted a place…

37:49.833 --> 37:52.041
where no one asked things of me.

37:53.583 --> 37:55.125
Because when they do,

37:56.916 --> 38:00.791
I almost invariably answer.

38:07.625 --> 38:12.416
And you, is there a place other than here
where you would like to live?

38:14.291 --> 38:16.708
Um, maybe Los Angeles.

38:17.958 --> 38:20.791
Maybe I could write for the movies.

38:20.875 --> 38:23.083
Well, I suppose someone has to do it.

38:24.250 --> 38:26.333
And would you long for home,

38:26.833 --> 38:30.958
to see your father's face
or put flowers on your mother's grave?

38:31.041 --> 38:34.625
Yeah. I… I would come back
every once in a while.

38:34.708 --> 38:37.500
Well, if you do go
to that godforsaken place

38:37.583 --> 38:40.208
and enter that enterprise,

38:40.291 --> 38:43.791
know that it is difficult and unfair,

38:44.416 --> 38:45.958
and you will make enemies.

38:47.458 --> 38:48.791
Lord knows I did.

38:49.375 --> 38:50.416
Yeah, I know.

38:54.625 --> 38:58.375
Craig, I need you to promise me something.

38:59.000 --> 38:59.833
Okay.

39:01.583 --> 39:03.333
When you cross their path,

39:04.583 --> 39:07.041
you will dispatch them with haste.

39:07.583 --> 39:08.791
These enemies.

39:09.375 --> 39:10.666
Dispatch.

39:10.750 --> 39:12.166
With haste.

39:12.958 --> 39:17.375
And feel not one iota of guilt
for having done so.

39:19.375 --> 39:20.625
Promise me.

39:22.166 --> 39:23.708
Promise me!

39:26.583 --> 39:27.583
Okay.

39:28.625 --> 39:29.708
I promise you.

39:31.083 --> 39:32.125
All right.

39:41.666 --> 39:43.125
Thank you, Mr. Harrigan.

39:44.833 --> 39:46.416
My pleasure, Craig.

39:48.333 --> 39:49.458
All of it.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.916
<i>I found him</i>
<i>both terrifying and exciting.</i>

40:12.458 --> 40:15.875
<i>Even in his weakened state, he had power.</i>

40:17.458 --> 40:19.250
<i>He may have even been dangerous.</i>

40:20.958 --> 40:22.375
<i>But I was his friend.</i>

40:22.458 --> 40:23.333
<i>He said it.</i>

40:25.750 --> 40:28.333
<i>And judging from</i>
<i>the untouched scratch-offs in his drawer,</i>

40:28.916 --> 40:30.541
<i>I don't think he had too many.</i>

41:31.583 --> 41:32.500
Mr. Harrigan?

42:04.833 --> 42:05.916
Mr. Harrigan?

42:08.125 --> 42:09.375
Mr. Harrigan?

42:11.583 --> 42:12.500
Sir?

42:36.166 --> 42:38.458
-Will you excuse me? This is my son.

42:40.250 --> 42:41.083
Craig?

42:42.875 --> 42:44.583
It's Mr. Harrigan. I think…

42:45.125 --> 42:46.208
I think he's dead.

42:46.291 --> 42:49.000
<i>-He's not breathing. I think he's…</i>
Where are the housekeepers?

42:50.041 --> 42:51.416
It's Tuesday.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.458
They're… they're not here.

42:53.541 --> 42:54.708
<i>Okay, listen to me.</i>

42:54.791 --> 42:56.666
Uh, you just wait there.

42:56.750 --> 42:59.166
Go ahead and wait outside,
and I'll call an ambulance, okay?

43:16.500 --> 43:18.250
<i>"It was the best of times."</i>

43:18.875 --> 43:20.583
<i>"It was the worst of times."</i>

43:21.500 --> 43:25.208
<i>"It was the age of wisdom,</i>
<i>and it was the age of foolishness."</i>

43:28.750 --> 43:30.833
"It was the epoch of belief."

43:32.250 --> 43:34.250
"It was the epoch of incredulity."

43:34.833 --> 43:38.041
<i>"It was the season of Light.</i>
<i>It was the season of Darkness."</i>

43:38.125 --> 43:41.416
<i>"It was the spring of hope,</i>
<i>and it was the winter of despair."</i>

43:42.041 --> 43:45.125
<i>"We had everything before us,</i>
<i>and we had nothing before us."</i>

43:46.041 --> 43:48.125
<i>"We were all going direct to heaven."</i>

43:49.541 --> 43:51.875
<i>"We were all going direct the other way."</i>

43:54.625 --> 43:55.916
I'm gonna go to bed.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.000
Shit.

45:01.458 --> 45:07.000
"Let all bitterness, and wrath,
and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking

45:07.083 --> 45:09.875

45:10.458 --> 45:12.916
"And be ye kind one to another,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.541
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,

45:15.625 --> 45:18.416
even as God, for Christ's sake,
hath forgiven you."

45:29.416 --> 45:30.791
Wanna take a last look?

45:31.541 --> 45:34.208
I wanna wait. I wanna be last.

45:35.750 --> 45:37.750
Take your time. I'll meet you outside.

45:58.208 --> 46:00.208
<i>He was wearing a suit</i>
<i>I'd never seen before,</i>

46:00.291 --> 46:03.583
<i>and the funeral guy had rouged him up</i>
<i>a bit so he'd look healthy,</i>

46:03.666 --> 46:07.416
<i>except healthy people</i>
<i>don't lie in coffins with their eyes shut.</i>

46:34.916 --> 46:37.083
Many, who've come
from far and wide,

46:37.583 --> 46:38.750
respected John's…

46:38.833 --> 46:41.375
<i>Mr. Harrigan was buried</i>
<i>very near my mother.</i>

46:42.250 --> 46:44.291
<i>I'd only been to her grave once.</i>

46:44.375 --> 46:47.375
<i>Dad visited her weekly, but I stayed away.</i>

46:47.875 --> 46:50.458
<i>I guess because if I did visit…</i>

46:53.916 --> 46:55.708
<i>I'd know she was gone forever.</i>

46:58.875 --> 47:01.666
John Harrigan
was a tough shell to crack,

47:01.750 --> 47:03.125
but I knew he was a fair man.

47:03.208 --> 47:06.375
I wonder if he'd be surprised
that people showed up today.

47:22.166 --> 47:24.208
Excuse me. You're Craig, right?

47:24.291 --> 47:25.291
Yes, sir.

47:25.375 --> 47:30.541
I'm Chick Rafferty. I handle…
handled John Harrigan's finances.

47:30.625 --> 47:31.958
I was hoping to have a quick chat.

47:32.041 --> 47:34.416
It concerns you having
something of Mr. Harrigan's.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.291
Uh, I…

47:36.875 --> 47:39.041
You should hear from his lawyers
in a week or so.

47:39.125 --> 47:40.833
-Am I in trouble?
-Yeah. What is this about?

47:40.916 --> 47:42.500
Don't worry. It's a good thing.

47:43.750 --> 47:45.500
Well, this should explain it all.

47:45.583 --> 47:47.541
I received it two months ago

47:47.625 --> 47:50.666
and was instructed to hold it
until such an occasion as this.

47:52.625 --> 47:54.500
Well, have a good day.

48:10.291 --> 48:11.250
What?

48:12.708 --> 48:14.500
I think you might be in the will.

48:18.416 --> 48:19.666
Should I open it now?

48:31.125 --> 48:34.791
"Craig, if you're reading this,
I've died."

48:34.875 --> 48:40.416
"I have left you $800,000 in trust."

48:43.416 --> 48:45.916
"The trustees are your father
and Charles Rafferty."

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
"My business manager
will now serve as my executor."

48:49.083 --> 48:53.291
"I calculate the sum should be sufficient
to see you through four years of college…"

48:53.375 --> 48:56.208
<i>…and any postgraduate work</i>
<i>you may choose.</i>

48:56.291 --> 49:01.208
<i>Enough should remain</i>
<i>to give you a start in your chosen career.</i>

49:01.291 --> 49:05.125
<i>You spoke of screenwriting,</i>
<i>and if it's what you want,</i>

49:05.666 --> 49:10.000
<i>then, of course, you must pursue it</i>
<i>but know that I do not approve.</i>

49:10.583 --> 49:13.250
<i>There is a vulgar joke</i>
<i>about screenwriters.</i>

49:13.333 --> 49:15.041
<i>I will not repeat it here,</i>

49:15.125 --> 49:17.666
<i>but by all means, find it on your phone.</i>

49:18.166 --> 49:22.458
<i>Keywords "screenwriter" and "starlet."</i>

49:23.000 --> 49:29.208
<i>Films are ephemeral, while books,</i>
<i>good ones, are eternal or close to it.</i>

49:29.875 --> 49:33.458
"You have read me many good ones,
but others are waiting to be written."

49:33.958 --> 49:35.291
"This is all I will say."

49:35.375 --> 49:38.958
"Even with school expenses,
your 800,000 may grow to a million or more

49:39.041 --> 49:42.500
by the time you reach the age of 26,
when the trust will expire,

49:42.583 --> 49:46.166
and you can spend
or invest the rest as you choose."

49:46.250 --> 49:49.708
"PS. I will miss
our afternoons together too."

49:57.833 --> 49:58.833
What is it?

50:00.541 --> 50:02.375
You look like you've seen a ghost.

50:46.166 --> 50:48.625
<i>I'm not answering my phone now.</i>

50:48.708 --> 50:52.000
<i>I will call you back</i>
<i>if it seems appropriate.</i>

50:53.708 --> 50:55.375
I miss you, Mr. Harrigan.

50:56.291 --> 50:58.333
I appreciate all the money
that you gave me,

50:58.416 --> 51:02.125
but I'd give it back
to have you still around.

51:04.041 --> 51:07.583
I know that probably sounds
like a lie, but it's not.

51:11.208 --> 51:12.291
It really isn't.

51:36.625 --> 51:37.833
You up?

51:39.416 --> 51:41.250
-Yeah.
-Making breakfast.

51:59.666 --> 52:00.666
Dad!

52:00.750 --> 52:03.833
He's not dead.
Mr. Harrigan, not at 2:30 this morning.

52:03.916 --> 52:05.583
-"C-C-C."
-We gotta dig him up.

52:05.666 --> 52:07.416
-We buried him alive.
-What are you talking about?

52:07.500 --> 52:10.208
We have to get somebody out there.
We have to get bulldozers and…

52:10.291 --> 52:13.541
Craig, stop. Stop. What… what is going on?

52:15.583 --> 52:18.708
-I put his phone in his casket.
-Why did you put his phone in the casket?

52:18.791 --> 52:21.708
I know I shouldn't have done it.
I know it's creepy, but I did. Now this.

52:26.708 --> 52:28.666
Yeah, well, gotta be
an explanation for this.

52:28.750 --> 52:31.166
Somebody hacked his phone.
They… they cloned it.

52:31.250 --> 52:33.583
They're just playing
a practical joke on you.

52:33.666 --> 52:36.583
If it's a practical joke,
why isn't it something funny like,

52:36.666 --> 52:39.041
Uh, "Help, I'm trapped in a box"?

52:39.125 --> 52:40.250
That actually is funny.

52:40.333 --> 52:43.541
Why is it two A's and my initial
three times? Doesn't make any sense.

52:44.333 --> 52:46.291
We have to go. We have to check on him.

52:46.375 --> 52:49.791
No, we don't, and I'm gonna tell you why.

52:50.375 --> 52:51.666
-Sit down.
-No.

52:51.750 --> 52:52.875
Craig, sit down.

52:59.291 --> 53:01.083
John Harrigan died unattended.

53:01.625 --> 53:04.166
And because of this, there was an autopsy,

53:04.708 --> 53:07.791
which is how they found out
he died of heart disease.

53:08.416 --> 53:09.583
They cut him open?

53:10.750 --> 53:11.708
Yeah.

53:12.750 --> 53:16.375
I don't like telling you that.
I don't want that preying on your mind.

53:16.458 --> 53:21.416
But it's better than having you think
that he was buried alive?

53:21.916 --> 53:24.375
He wasn't. He couldn't have been.

53:24.958 --> 53:25.916
He's dead.

53:27.750 --> 53:28.791
You understand?

53:30.083 --> 53:31.041
Yes.

54:19.291 --> 54:21.333
What are you doing here, boy?

54:32.000 --> 54:32.875
Thank you.

54:36.333 --> 54:37.625
Are you all right, Craig?

54:37.708 --> 54:38.708
Yes.

54:40.083 --> 54:42.000
He said he was gonna leave you something.

54:42.708 --> 54:44.625
-Did he?
-He did.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.541
He was very generous.

54:48.625 --> 54:50.375
Took care of me and Pete too.

54:50.875 --> 54:52.625
Yeah. He was a…

54:54.333 --> 54:56.291
he was a good man, wasn't he?

54:57.458 --> 55:02.000
He was square-dealing,
but you didn't wanna be on his bad side.

55:03.750 --> 55:04.791
What do you mean?

55:04.875 --> 55:06.541
You remember Dusty Bilodeau?

55:07.041 --> 55:09.666
Bilodeaus that lived over
at Black Bear Trailer Park.

55:09.750 --> 55:12.250
Oh, I've seen it. What about him?

55:13.083 --> 55:16.541
He was the gardener afore Pete
but wasn't eight months on the job

55:16.625 --> 55:19.291
when Mr. Harrigan caught him stealing
and fired his butt.

55:19.375 --> 55:23.750
Dusty didn't apologize. Just left.
Thought that was the end of it.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.166
It wasn't.

55:27.750 --> 55:30.166
What happened to him?
What happened to Dusty?

55:31.041 --> 55:32.166
I've said enough.

55:34.958 --> 55:38.666
Is there anything you want from the house?
Something to remember him by?

55:41.666 --> 55:42.500
Um…

55:43.375 --> 55:45.666
I don't know. An orchid, maybe?

55:50.250 --> 55:51.375
Yes, dear.

55:53.791 --> 55:55.041
Take an orchid.

56:40.708 --> 56:44.208
<i>Chick Rafferty kept Edna and Pete</i>
<i>on to keep up the place.</i>

56:44.291 --> 56:47.208
<i>A "for sale" sign</i>
<i>from a Portland realty company went up,</i>

56:47.291 --> 56:48.791
<i>and a few people came to look.</i>

56:50.666 --> 56:52.666
<i>After all the turmoil</i>
<i>with the hacked phone,</i>

56:52.750 --> 56:54.375
<i>the world slowed down a bit for me.</i>

56:54.458 --> 56:57.083
<i>School was fine,</i>
<i>and I even enjoyed my classes.</i>

57:01.750 --> 57:03.208
<i>Ms. Hart taught the sciences,</i>

57:03.291 --> 57:05.458
<i>and she was</i>
<i>the best teacher at the school.</i>

57:05.541 --> 57:07.541
Can anyone tell me
where the majority of our…

57:07.625 --> 57:08.916
Craig.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.916
Marine life contributes 70% of our oxygen.

57:13.750 --> 57:14.583
That's right.

57:15.416 --> 57:16.625
You're 100% right.

57:28.500 --> 57:32.250
<i>Kenny Yankovich got expelled</i>
<i>the final time for selling pot on campus.</i>

57:33.250 --> 57:35.791
<i>He thought I ratted on him, but I didn't.</i>

57:35.875 --> 57:38.958
<i>Though I can't say I wasn't happy</i>
<i>not to see him every day.</i>

57:40.458 --> 57:43.375
<i>Like most places,</i>
<i>Gates Falls High had school functions.</i>

57:43.458 --> 57:46.666
<i>And the one at the end of</i>
<i>the first semester was the winter dance.</i>

57:46.750 --> 57:50.916
<i>One of those Sadie Hawkins kind of deals</i>
<i>where the girls ask the boys.</i>

57:51.416 --> 57:53.375
<i>I had a gut feeling</i>
<i>Margie was gonna ask me,</i>

57:53.458 --> 57:56.250
<i>but I didn't like her,</i>
<i>you know, like that.</i>

57:56.333 --> 57:58.333
<i>So I was hoping to get another invite.</i>

58:26.208 --> 58:28.375
-I have to use the ladies' room.
-I'll walk with you.

58:28.458 --> 58:30.416
We have
two more songs for you tonight.

58:31.250 --> 58:32.291
I'll wait for you.

58:38.083 --> 58:39.166
You're a dead man.

58:39.791 --> 58:40.833
What are you doing?

58:40.916 --> 58:42.666
-Get off of me.
-I'm gonna kill you.

58:45.041 --> 58:47.250
-I know it was you who narced on me!
-Wasn't me--

58:48.291 --> 58:51.958
Why? Why? Why did you
have to do that, man? Why?

58:52.666 --> 58:54.541
Now I have to kick your ass.

59:05.083 --> 59:06.500
I didn't wanna hurt you.

59:06.583 --> 59:07.875
-But…

59:14.000 --> 59:17.125
If you tell anyone about this,
you're dead.

59:19.250 --> 59:20.458
Craig!

59:23.625 --> 59:25.458
Okay, there we go.

59:26.375 --> 59:29.500
Regina, go to the gym and tell Mr. Taylor
I'll be back in ten minutes.

59:29.583 --> 59:31.333
Have him call Craig's father.

59:33.208 --> 59:36.458
You know I gotta report this, right?
Was it Yankovich?

59:37.500 --> 59:38.583
It wasn't Kenny,

59:39.791 --> 59:40.625
which is good.

59:40.708 --> 59:43.583
See, if it was him,
I bet he'd get arrested

59:44.250 --> 59:45.666
'cause he's already expelled.

59:45.750 --> 59:48.500
Then there'd be a trial,
and then I'd have to go into court,

59:48.583 --> 59:49.833
and everyone would know.

59:51.583 --> 59:54.875
And what happens
when he beats the next person up?

59:54.958 --> 59:55.916
Hold it.

1:00:00.958 --> 1:00:02.375
I just wanna get by.

1:00:06.791 --> 1:00:08.583
You know what, Craig? I think you will.

1:00:13.166 --> 1:00:15.333
Okay. Let me get this lip.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:18.750
Come here.

1:00:19.291 --> 1:00:20.375
You're not… Ouch.

1:00:20.458 --> 1:00:21.333
Sorry.

1:00:21.833 --> 1:00:23.625
You're not from here, are you?

1:00:23.708 --> 1:00:24.791
I'm from Boston.

1:00:24.875 --> 1:00:29.000
Well, Lowell,
but I went to college in Boston.

1:00:29.083 --> 1:00:30.000
Where?

1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:31.500
Emerson.

1:00:36.958 --> 1:00:38.041
What's up?

1:00:39.333 --> 1:00:42.708
No, nothing. Just… you smell good.

1:00:43.500 --> 1:00:45.750
-It's just soap.
-Okay.

1:00:45.833 --> 1:00:49.875
Yeah, it's Booth Bay soap.
You can find it in Gates Falls.

1:00:50.916 --> 1:00:53.083
It's really nice.
You should grab some for your…

1:00:55.958 --> 1:00:57.791
I mean, you can get it for anyone, so…

1:00:58.625 --> 1:00:59.750
Thank you.

1:01:01.041 --> 1:01:03.875
For cleaning me up and talking to me and…

1:01:06.875 --> 1:01:10.000
…making high school almost tolerable.

1:01:12.875 --> 1:01:13.958
I owe you.

1:01:14.041 --> 1:01:16.250
No, you don't owe me anything.

1:01:16.333 --> 1:01:17.166
I do.

1:01:18.333 --> 1:01:19.458
I really do.

1:01:31.166 --> 1:01:32.250
Who did it, Craig?

1:01:32.750 --> 1:01:35.000
Can we not do this, Dad?

1:01:35.083 --> 1:01:36.208
I'm fine.

1:01:36.875 --> 1:01:38.500
Yeah, well…

1:01:41.125 --> 1:01:43.291
You gotta talk to someone
about this, Craig.

1:01:50.250 --> 1:01:53.291
Mr. Harrigan, it's me, Craig.

1:01:54.083 --> 1:02:00.583
And I know you won't hear this,
but something happened tonight,

1:02:01.125 --> 1:02:02.583
and I just wanted to…

1:02:03.166 --> 1:02:06.125
I just needed to talk to somebody.

1:02:09.458 --> 1:02:12.750
I got beat up pretty bad

1:02:13.458 --> 1:02:20.166
by this big, stupid,
dumb idiot named Kenny Yankovich.

1:02:23.708 --> 1:02:25.541
But I did what I promised you.

1:02:26.875 --> 1:02:27.833
I…

1:02:29.083 --> 1:02:30.500
I dispatched him.

1:02:33.166 --> 1:02:35.416
You know? I tried to, at least.

1:02:36.208 --> 1:02:37.083
Um…

1:02:38.791 --> 1:02:40.333
But it was a good punch.

1:02:42.458 --> 1:02:46.666
Good enough that I'm afraid
he'll come at me again.

1:02:51.625 --> 1:02:55.708
I'm honestly pretty afraid
that this won't end,

1:02:56.625 --> 1:03:00.000
and I wish that you were here
to just give me some advice.

1:03:56.375 --> 1:03:58.250
<i>I know it seems pretty obvious,</i>

1:03:58.333 --> 1:04:00.916
<i>but that was the first time it struck me</i>
<i>that everybody,</i>

1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:04.833
<i>even assholes, have parents,</i>
<i>families who miss them,</i>

1:04:05.875 --> 1:04:06.875
<i>cry for them.</i>

1:04:08.583 --> 1:04:11.416
<i>I stupidly thought</i>
<i>that grief was somehow special to me.</i>

1:04:15.041 --> 1:04:17.791
<i>The obituary for Kenneth James Yankovich</i>

1:04:17.875 --> 1:04:20.500
<i>wasn't in the </i>Gates Falls Tribune
<i>until Tuesday.</i>

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:22.250
<i>And all it said was,</i>

1:04:22.333 --> 1:04:26.291
<i>"Passed away suddenly</i>
<i>as a result of a tragic accident."</i>

1:04:28.875 --> 1:04:29.958
Bye, Ms. Hart.

1:04:37.208 --> 1:04:39.083
-Craig.
-Hmm?

1:04:41.375 --> 1:04:43.166
-Oh.
-No, wait a minute.

1:04:43.250 --> 1:04:44.583
No, I got class.

1:04:44.666 --> 1:04:45.833
I'll write you a note.

1:04:48.291 --> 1:04:49.666
Where are you today?

1:04:50.750 --> 1:04:51.583
Here.

1:04:51.666 --> 1:04:52.875
Not really.

1:04:53.375 --> 1:04:54.666
Is this about Kenny?

1:04:55.791 --> 1:04:56.750
Craig,

1:04:58.375 --> 1:05:02.166
if you're thinking you had
something to do with his death,

1:05:03.125 --> 1:05:04.500
I've seen his records.

1:05:05.666 --> 1:05:10.291
Kenny was sadly a kid
with serious problems.

1:05:11.541 --> 1:05:14.333
Home problems, school problems.

1:05:14.416 --> 1:05:16.541
He had psychological problems.

1:05:16.625 --> 1:05:18.166
I don't know what happened,

1:05:19.333 --> 1:05:20.916
but it had nothing to do with you.

1:05:26.958 --> 1:05:30.083
Okay, go ahead. You'll make your class.

1:05:34.750 --> 1:05:35.791
Craig.

1:05:39.583 --> 1:05:41.708
I can never be glad when a child dies.

1:05:43.416 --> 1:05:45.250
But I can be glad it wasn't you.

1:05:49.375 --> 1:05:53.250
Ms. Hart, do you…
do you believe in ghosts?

1:05:53.333 --> 1:05:54.333
Um…

1:05:55.083 --> 1:05:57.791
Well, I suppose you wouldn't,
being a scientist.

1:05:57.875 --> 1:06:00.291
I'm a teacher, not a scientist.

1:06:00.375 --> 1:06:02.291
I know, but you know what I mean.

1:06:02.375 --> 1:06:04.500
I don't like to think about
that kind of stuff.

1:06:04.583 --> 1:06:08.208
You know, I would never attend a séance
or mess around with a Ouija board,

1:06:08.291 --> 1:06:10.125
trying to summon the dead.

1:06:11.083 --> 1:06:12.208
How come?

1:06:15.916 --> 1:06:17.458
My grandma always used to say,

1:06:17.541 --> 1:06:20.708
"A person shouldn't call out
unless they want an answer…

1:06:22.750 --> 1:06:25.375
because not all ghosts are holy."

1:06:30.375 --> 1:06:33.166
Craig, you gotta go. You got a class.

1:07:13.916 --> 1:07:15.250
They ain't home.

1:07:19.541 --> 1:07:20.916
Is this the Bilodeaus'?

1:07:23.666 --> 1:07:25.166
I suppose it is.

1:07:28.208 --> 1:07:30.375
Um, well, do you know
when they'll be back?

1:07:31.208 --> 1:07:33.000
Not likely soon.

1:07:35.333 --> 1:07:37.125
I was looking for Dusty Bilodeau.

1:07:37.625 --> 1:07:39.541
Here were where they found him.

1:07:39.625 --> 1:07:41.083
"Where they found him"?

1:07:43.458 --> 1:07:46.708
Lost his job
working for some rich asshole.

1:07:46.791 --> 1:07:49.250
Fired. Had to go on the dole.

1:07:50.666 --> 1:07:52.666
Spent a year looking for work,

1:07:52.750 --> 1:07:55.250
then drove his truck
into that thresher garage,

1:07:55.333 --> 1:07:58.250
lowered the door, and cranked her up.

1:08:53.833 --> 1:08:56.208
He painted that before he went inside.

1:09:04.375 --> 1:09:05.916
Nobody could figure what it meant.

1:09:09.250 --> 1:09:14.500
Phones that haven't been charged
can't ring, and they can't play messages.

1:09:15.125 --> 1:09:18.416
And they can't text back.

1:09:19.750 --> 1:09:21.875
But it did.

1:09:23.666 --> 1:09:24.666
You did.

1:09:26.750 --> 1:09:28.750
I need to know something, Mr. Harrigan.

1:09:29.708 --> 1:09:33.875
I need to know if you had anything
to do with Kenny Yankovich dying.

1:09:35.125 --> 1:09:40.625
I know I told you that I was afraid,
but I didn't want him to die.

1:09:43.958 --> 1:09:45.083
This is crazy.

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.583
If you did have anything
to do with him dying, then…

1:09:52.708 --> 1:09:53.958
knock on my wall.

1:09:55.250 --> 1:09:56.666
Knock on my wall three times.

1:11:27.458 --> 1:11:28.458
Craig.

1:11:30.583 --> 1:11:33.333
If I tell you something,
can you keep it between us?

1:11:34.375 --> 1:11:37.416
I mean, you have to, right?
It's, like, a rule of some kind.

1:11:38.291 --> 1:11:40.291
<i>Your father's right, of course.</i>

1:11:40.875 --> 1:11:43.875
Your phone was hacked.
Somebody's messing with you.

1:11:45.166 --> 1:11:46.708
Your teacher is right too.

1:11:48.791 --> 1:11:50.625
I'm good friends with Father Ingersoll.

1:11:50.708 --> 1:11:52.166
St. Anne's over in Gates Falls.

1:11:52.250 --> 1:11:54.166
That's the church
where Kenny was baptized.

1:11:55.041 --> 1:11:57.666
He told me about the accident.
The details of the accident.

1:11:59.291 --> 1:12:02.875
Kenny tried to sneak out late at night
from his second-story bedroom.

1:12:02.958 --> 1:12:04.500
<i>He'd been drinking heavily.</i>

1:12:04.583 --> 1:12:06.833
<i>They think he slipped</i>
<i>on the roof and fell.</i>

1:12:08.458 --> 1:12:10.791
<i>It was a tragic accident. That's all.</i>

1:12:14.958 --> 1:12:16.708
<i>Snapped his neck on impact.</i>

1:12:22.791 --> 1:12:24.083
<i>You know, I think it's time</i>

1:12:24.166 --> 1:12:27.125
<i>that you examine your relationship</i>
<i>to your phone.</i>

1:12:27.208 --> 1:12:29.750
<i>You remember reading Matthew 5:30?</i>

1:12:30.458 --> 1:12:34.500
<i>"And if thy right hand offend thee,</i>
<i>cut it off, and cast it from thee</i>

1:12:35.833 --> 1:12:40.000
<i>for it is profitable for thee</i>
<i>that one of thy members should perish…</i>

1:12:42.333 --> 1:12:46.250
<i>and not that thy whole body</i>
<i>should be cast into hell."</i>

1:12:49.416 --> 1:12:52.000
-Hi, how can I help you?
-I need to get rid of my phone.

1:12:52.083 --> 1:12:53.250
Okay.

1:12:53.791 --> 1:12:55.208
You're gonna love this baby.

1:12:55.291 --> 1:12:58.416
I'm actually only upgrading
'cause I got some strange texts.

1:12:58.500 --> 1:12:59.666
Did you know the sender?

1:12:59.750 --> 1:13:02.958
Yeah, I did, but, um, he's not around.

1:13:03.041 --> 1:13:05.791
The first iPhones had some weird glitches.
Rushed production.

1:13:05.875 --> 1:13:08.541
My guess is that the messages
somehow got stuck in the software

1:13:08.625 --> 1:13:10.458
and would occasionally pop up.

1:13:10.541 --> 1:13:12.541
Call it a ghost in the machine.

1:13:12.625 --> 1:13:13.916
But not a holy one.

1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:14.958
Huh?

1:13:15.791 --> 1:13:16.625
Nothing.

1:13:16.708 --> 1:13:18.041
All right. Your number's the same.

1:13:18.125 --> 1:13:21.291
I've transferred your contacts and info
from your old phone to your new one.

1:13:21.375 --> 1:13:22.583
-All of them?
-Yeah.

1:13:22.666 --> 1:13:25.166
-You can delete the ones you don't need.
-Okay.

1:13:25.250 --> 1:13:28.166
As for your old phone,
we do have a charitable program here.

1:13:28.250 --> 1:13:30.750
We completely erase it,
scrub it, and donate it

1:13:30.833 --> 1:13:33.583
to people who need new cell phones
but can't afford them.

1:13:33.666 --> 1:13:35.000
Okay. Um…

1:13:35.083 --> 1:13:36.250
No, actually, um,

1:13:36.750 --> 1:13:40.250
I'll… I'll donate it myself.

1:13:40.833 --> 1:13:43.166
-My little sister needs one.
-Okay.

1:14:19.708 --> 1:14:20.916
Thank you, God.

1:15:27.708 --> 1:15:29.416
<i>You can hide things, but</i>

1:15:30.583 --> 1:15:33.375
<i>they're not gone, not really.</i>

1:15:34.708 --> 1:15:39.041
<i>They follow you, whisper in your ear,</i>
<i>making sure that you don't forget,</i>

1:15:39.541 --> 1:15:41.333
<i>that you continue to question.</i>

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:47.541
<i>I wondered where</i>
<i>the Yankovich family moved to</i>

1:15:48.458 --> 1:15:50.083
<i>and if they still grieved.</i>

1:15:57.416 --> 1:16:00.666
<i>I wondered if the old house made noises</i>
<i>with no one there to hear.</i>

1:16:01.833 --> 1:16:04.500
<i>Calling out, echoes.</i>

1:16:06.125 --> 1:16:09.041
<i>I wondered if Mr. Harrigan missed me.</i>

1:16:12.458 --> 1:16:14.958
<i>I wondered who I would become</i>

1:16:15.041 --> 1:16:19.375
<i>and whether what I'd done</i>
<i>would leave a mark on me, defining me.</i>

1:16:32.875 --> 1:16:34.000
I got in.

1:16:36.458 --> 1:16:38.458
<i>I wondered if anyone would ever know.</i>

1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:41.500
<i>I hope not.</i>

1:17:17.166 --> 1:17:19.125
-Got your AAA card?
-Yup.

1:17:19.208 --> 1:17:23.000
And, uh, new mailing address
is on the kitchen table?

1:17:23.083 --> 1:17:24.041
Yeah.

1:17:26.125 --> 1:17:28.375
Make sure you set up an account
at the bookstore.

1:17:28.458 --> 1:17:31.833
And do it soon
in case they run low on supplies.

1:17:31.916 --> 1:17:32.750
Okay, I will.

1:17:35.375 --> 1:17:36.416
Winter coats.

1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:39.833
No, I'll be back, Dad,
before winter.

1:17:42.958 --> 1:17:44.041
Gonna be okay?

1:17:44.125 --> 1:17:45.083
Yeah.

1:17:47.458 --> 1:17:49.416
I'm just so happy for you, buddy.

1:17:50.958 --> 1:17:52.083
Thanks, Dad.

1:17:57.041 --> 1:17:57.875
I love you.

1:17:59.041 --> 1:18:00.375
I love you too, buddy.

1:18:09.458 --> 1:18:10.291
Okay.

1:18:10.375 --> 1:18:12.916
-Call me if you need anything.
-I will. I will.

1:18:56.625 --> 1:18:58.958
<i>Someone once said</i>
<i>that you never really leave home</i>

1:18:59.041 --> 1:19:01.250
<i>but that you take it with you</i>
<i>wherever you go.</i>

1:19:01.916 --> 1:19:04.666
<i>Personally, I hope</i>
<i>that wasn't completely true</i>

1:19:04.750 --> 1:19:07.625
<i>as there were some things</i>
<i>I really wish would stay at home</i>

1:19:07.708 --> 1:19:09.375
<i>and not follow me to Boston,</i>

1:19:09.875 --> 1:19:12.916
<i>which was two hours</i>
<i>and a million miles from Harlow.</i>

1:19:16.458 --> 1:19:18.458
<i>I got a writing scholarship</i>
<i>to Emerson,</i>

1:19:18.541 --> 1:19:20.166
<i>which had a great journalism program.</i>

1:19:30.208 --> 1:19:31.041
-Yeah.
-Hey.

1:19:31.125 --> 1:19:32.291
Are you Craig?

1:19:32.875 --> 1:19:36.000
<i>My freshman roommate</i>
<i>was Julian Summers, from LA.</i>

1:19:36.083 --> 1:19:39.291
<i>Studying drama. Wanted to be a movie star.</i>

1:19:43.250 --> 1:19:46.166
…is the most important thing
that you can do.

1:19:46.250 --> 1:19:47.916
<i>I dug right in and studied hard.</i>

1:19:49.083 --> 1:19:51.250
<i>I felt like I owed that to my dad.</i>

1:19:51.333 --> 1:19:53.250
<i>And, of course, to Mr. Harrigan.</i>

1:19:56.333 --> 1:19:58.500
Hey, Craig,
take a quick look at this for me.

1:19:58.583 --> 1:20:00.458
Should the photo be below the byline?

1:20:00.541 --> 1:20:03.500
Near the top is more journalistic,
don't you think?

1:20:03.583 --> 1:20:05.416
-Yeah, probably. Thank you.
-Yeah.

1:20:07.125 --> 1:20:09.666
-How do you listen to this shit?
-A friend turned me on to it.

1:20:09.750 --> 1:20:12.666
Some friend.
Spin the dial, dude. Seriously.

1:20:31.291 --> 1:20:33.208
-Hey, Dad.
<i>-Hey, buddy.</i>

1:20:33.708 --> 1:20:36.291
-What's going on?
<i>-I've got some really bad news.</i>

1:20:45.125 --> 1:20:48.583
<i>The headline read,</i>
<i>"Beloved teacher killed in Vermont."</i>

1:20:49.125 --> 1:20:52.916
<i>And the opening line said,</i>
<i>"Victoria Corrales Hart,</i>

1:20:53.500 --> 1:20:56.125
<i>a biology teacher</i>
<i>at Gates Falls High School,</i>

1:20:56.208 --> 1:20:58.791
<i>was killed Sunday in a head-on collision."</i>

1:21:01.666 --> 1:21:04.833
<i>Since I left, Ms. Hart had gotten engaged.</i>

1:21:04.916 --> 1:21:07.833
<i>And that's who was with her that day,</i>
<i>her fiancé.</i>

1:21:08.875 --> 1:21:11.833
<i>They had taken a long weekend</i>
<i>to visit the town of Chester,</i>

1:21:11.916 --> 1:21:14.791
<i>stay in a cabin retreat,</i>
<i>and soak up some autumn.</i>

1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.208
<i>They were on their way back</i>
<i>and almost to the New Hampshire border</i>

1:21:25.291 --> 1:21:29.000
<i>when they approached Deane Whitmore</i>
<i>of Waltham, Massachusetts.</i>

1:21:59.583 --> 1:22:01.875
-Oh!

1:22:38.708 --> 1:22:39.666
Where's her fiancé?

1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:43.333
He's still in the hospital.
Gonna be there a while.

1:22:43.416 --> 1:22:45.500
I heard the asshole that did this
was so drunk

1:22:45.583 --> 1:22:47.041
that he walked away without a scrape.

1:22:47.125 --> 1:22:50.083
Guy had four drunk driving arrests
and no current license.

1:22:50.166 --> 1:22:52.125
He better not get away with this.

1:22:55.541 --> 1:22:56.375
He won't.

1:22:56.458 --> 1:22:59.291
The four-year prison sentence
will be suspended

1:22:59.375 --> 1:23:02.750
if the defendant agrees to rehab
for six months.

1:23:03.333 --> 1:23:04.291
<i>But he did.</i>

1:23:04.791 --> 1:23:06.208
<i>He did get away with it.</i>

1:23:07.958 --> 1:23:10.125
<i>Deane Whitmore was sent to a rehab center</i>

1:23:10.208 --> 1:23:12.375
<i>that was more like a country club</i>
<i>than a prison.</i>

1:25:54.375 --> 1:25:55.416
Mr. Harrigan.

1:25:57.958 --> 1:25:59.916
There's a man named Deane Whitmore

1:26:00.583 --> 1:26:02.833
who killed a teacher of mine
from high school.

1:26:04.750 --> 1:26:05.875
He was drunk

1:26:07.125 --> 1:26:09.708
and crashed into Ms. Hart and her fiancé.

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.416
She was a good person.

1:26:14.666 --> 1:26:16.750
She helped me when I needed help,

1:26:17.916 --> 1:26:19.666
and he didn't get what he deserved.

1:26:23.375 --> 1:26:24.500
I want him dead.

1:26:32.666 --> 1:26:36.000
<i>As soon as I hung up the phone,</i>
<i>I regretted making the call.</i>

1:26:46.416 --> 1:26:47.583
<i>I felt guilty.</i>

1:26:49.458 --> 1:26:50.666
<i>I was guilty.</i>

1:26:53.333 --> 1:26:55.750
<i>I told myself it was crazy</i>
<i>to even think about.</i>

1:26:56.875 --> 1:26:58.250
<i>That it was impossible.</i>

1:26:58.750 --> 1:27:00.916
<i>That nothing would happen</i>
<i>to Deane Whitmore.</i>

1:27:01.791 --> 1:27:03.041
<i>That I should let it go.</i>

1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:02.416
Hi.

1:28:03.416 --> 1:28:04.333
What do you want?

1:28:04.416 --> 1:28:06.000
I work for a newspaper in Boston.

1:28:06.083 --> 1:28:09.791
I was hoping to get some information
on someone who's being treated here.

1:28:09.875 --> 1:28:11.666
Go to the front. Ask in there.

1:28:12.291 --> 1:28:13.166
Deane Whitmore.

1:28:19.958 --> 1:28:20.791
Yeah.

1:28:21.625 --> 1:28:23.041
I wanna know how he died.

1:28:23.875 --> 1:28:26.041
I'd be willing to pay $100
for some information.

1:29:07.583 --> 1:29:08.791
200.

1:29:11.250 --> 1:29:12.083
He killed himself.

1:29:12.166 --> 1:29:13.750
-How?
-In the shower.

1:29:14.666 --> 1:29:15.625
How?

1:29:16.416 --> 1:29:17.916
You sure you wanna hear this?

1:29:19.166 --> 1:29:20.083
Yes.

1:29:20.583 --> 1:29:23.833
Each guest has their own room,
their own shower.

1:29:23.916 --> 1:29:25.125
It's nice. Real lux.

1:29:25.208 --> 1:29:27.458
-Way better than where I live, for sure.
-How?

1:29:29.291 --> 1:29:30.833
Choked himself to death.

1:29:32.041 --> 1:29:33.166
Before breakfast,

1:29:33.250 --> 1:29:35.541
he chugged down some shampoo
to grease the runway.

1:29:35.625 --> 1:29:38.416
Then he took a fancy bar of soap
and broke it in two.

1:29:38.500 --> 1:29:39.666
Dropped half on the floor

1:29:39.750 --> 1:29:42.041
and crammed the other half
down his throat.

1:29:45.708 --> 1:29:47.166
You said fancy soap.

1:29:48.291 --> 1:29:49.458
Starts with a B.

1:29:49.541 --> 1:29:50.625
Booth Bay?

1:29:50.708 --> 1:29:52.958
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
How'd you know?

1:29:55.125 --> 1:29:56.750
Did he write a suicide note?

1:29:56.833 --> 1:29:59.291
Sort of. Piece of paper. One line.

1:29:59.375 --> 1:30:00.458
What'd it say?

1:30:00.541 --> 1:30:02.875
It was kind of sweet, actually.
A bit of a prayer.

1:30:02.958 --> 1:30:07.125
It was, um, "keep giving all the love…"

1:30:07.208 --> 1:30:09.000
"…love you can." It's not a prayer.

1:30:09.083 --> 1:30:10.041
It's not?

1:30:13.208 --> 1:30:14.541
It's lyrics to a song.

1:30:30.458 --> 1:30:33.833
<i>When you fall, even if you see it coming,</i>

1:30:34.375 --> 1:30:36.125
<i>even if you willed it to happen,</i>

1:30:37.083 --> 1:30:38.458
<i>it still shocks you.</i>

1:30:39.333 --> 1:30:41.125
<i>-There's no bottom.</i>

1:30:41.208 --> 1:30:42.250
<i>No end.</i>

1:30:42.333 --> 1:30:44.875
<i>You just fall.</i>

1:31:12.625 --> 1:31:13.875
<i>"The horror."</i>

1:31:15.416 --> 1:31:16.791
<i>"The horror."</i>

1:31:51.833 --> 1:31:54.458
<i>After you died,</i>
<i>I went into your closet.</i>

1:31:55.833 --> 1:31:57.208
<i>The secret closet.</i>

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:02.333
<i>It's not terrible at all. Just memories.</i>

1:32:03.375 --> 1:32:05.500
<i>Your secrets are my secrets.</i>

1:32:07.750 --> 1:32:09.458
<i>That's why you chose me to read.</i>

1:32:11.375 --> 1:32:13.250
<i>Your mother died when you were a boy.</i>

1:32:14.916 --> 1:32:15.916
<i>Just like me.</i>

1:32:20.083 --> 1:32:21.833
<i>You knew what loneliness felt like.</i>

1:32:23.416 --> 1:32:24.833
<i>What it feels like.</i>

1:32:27.958 --> 1:32:29.125
<i>Just like me.</i>

1:32:31.625 --> 1:32:33.875
<i>I think that's why</i>
<i>you tried to stay in touch.</i>

1:32:44.583 --> 1:32:48.250
It took a while,
but I figured it out, Mr. Harrigan,

1:32:48.833 --> 1:32:51.083
what you were trying to tell me
in your texts.

1:32:52.708 --> 1:32:53.541
Um…

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.375
C-C-C

1:32:57.958 --> 1:32:59.125
S-T…

1:33:02.500 --> 1:33:05.291
means, "Craig, stop,"

1:33:06.625 --> 1:33:07.666
doesn't it?

1:33:10.250 --> 1:33:12.208
Are you telling me to stop

1:33:13.666 --> 1:33:15.083
because I'm hurting you?

1:33:18.500 --> 1:33:22.541
If that is the case,
that it's hurting you, then I'm sorry.

1:33:23.708 --> 1:33:24.916
I'm really sorry.

1:33:30.958 --> 1:33:35.500
Or are you saying stop
because I'm hurting myself?

1:33:41.291 --> 1:33:45.291
Is it just you looking out
because you care?

1:33:50.208 --> 1:33:51.666
If that's it, then…

1:33:54.083 --> 1:33:55.125
thank you.

1:34:00.041 --> 1:34:00.875
Thank you.

1:34:11.791 --> 1:34:13.541
You can rest now, Mr. Harrigan.

1:34:47.083 --> 1:34:49.291
I'm sorry, Mom.

1:34:52.833 --> 1:34:54.166
I'm so sorry.

1:37:01.875 --> 1:37:03.500
<i>In the 21st century,</i>

1:37:04.291 --> 1:37:07.250
<i>I think our phones</i>
<i>are how we are wedded to the world.</i>

1:37:08.875 --> 1:37:11.916
<i>If so, it's probably a bad marriage.</i>

1:37:14.083 --> 1:37:16.500
<i>There are a great many things</i>
<i>I'm not sure of anymore.</i>

1:37:16.583 --> 1:37:18.750

1:37:26.916 --> 1:37:28.000

1:37:29.291 --> 1:37:30.750
<i>when it's my time to go…</i>

<i>I wanna be buried with empty pockets.</i>
