[all gasping]

16:39.164 --> 16:40.499
No, no,
I'm not a witch.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.459
I just get all bloated
and tired.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.503
{\an3}You're allergic to Jesus,
lady.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.255
I'm no witch expert,

16:46.338 --> 16:48.507
{\an3}but I'm pretty sure
a Jesus allergy

16:48.590 --> 16:49.967
puts you in that category.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.760
- String her up.
- No, no, no.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.886
[all yelling]

16:52.970 --> 16:54.847
- Take that witch down a peg.
- Witch!

16:54.930 --> 16:58.225
Oh, no, if there was some sort
of gluten-free Jesus body,

16:58.308 --> 16:58.684
I'm sure that I could eat it.

16:58.767 --> 16:59.476
Too late, witch.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.645
Chuck her overboard.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.232
If she sinks,
she dies a good, honest death.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.483
If she floats, she's a witch,

17:07.568 --> 17:10.154
and we'll burn her real nice
once she gets to shore.

17:10.237 --> 17:10.779
{\an5}(woman)
No, no.
Ahh!

17:10.863 --> 17:12.489
Throw her in the water!

17:12.573 --> 17:13.490
[all yelling]

17:13.574 --> 17:15.451
You're not going
to escape this time, witch.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.828
Not again.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.789
I can totally drink the wine
or blood of Christ or whatever.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.458
It's just the complex carbs.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.292
- They really slow me down.
- Blah, blah, blah.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.752
Sounds like witch talk to me.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.546
If I had a dollar for every time

17:27.628 --> 17:30.758
I heard a witch drone on
about complex carbs,

17:30.841 --> 17:32.301
I'd be a rich man.

17:32.384 --> 17:32.885
Light her up, boys.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.720
No, I could eat soy.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.346
Is there, like,
a soy Christ or something?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.599
If she burns,
she dies a good, honest death.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.310
If she doesn't, well,

17:41.393 --> 17:43.729
we'll chop
this witch's head clean off.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.147
Burn the witch.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.982

Come on, boys,
let's burn that witch.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.525

17:49.693 --> 17:52.070
Well, frankly, I'm shocked.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.449
It almost never
gets to phase three.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.242

Right.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.317
If the show
upsets you that much,

18:30.400 --> 18:31.443
you could always just
change the channel,

18:31.527 --> 18:34.738
or, better yet, just
turn off the TV all together.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.121
