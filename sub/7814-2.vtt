20:09.041 --> 20:10.750
No!

20:10.750 --> 20:12.166
Hey, is this the place

20:12.166 --> 20:14.458
with that freaky, cool
flying nacho cheese kid

20:14.458 --> 20:15.625
we saw on the Internet?

20:20.375 --> 20:21.417
That was awesome.

20:21.417 --> 20:23.291
Yeah, we were just
sitting around for hours

20:23.291 --> 20:25.458
talking about how great
this party is.

20:25.458 --> 20:29.667
Dude, that’s because you be
bumping with the Brad.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.000
I got food,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.375
music, and the entertainment
is off the "hiz-ook".

20:37.250 --> 20:38.500
Kick.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.041
<i>♪♪ [rock]</i>

20:44.041 --> 20:45.500
[cheering]

20:45.500 --> 20:46.709
Wait!

20:48.041 --> 20:49.750
You’re out of nachos.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.208
No problemo. I’ll just run

20:55.208 --> 20:57.208
Keep it bumping, party people.

20:57.208 --> 20:59.583
