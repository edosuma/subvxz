NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.295 --> 00:05.877
You turned Hook into a Dark One?

00:05.964 --> 00:07.079
It was the only way to save him.

00:07.174 --> 00:10.382
After spending centuries
quelling my bloodlust,

00:10.469 --> 00:12.585
you threw me right back
into that darkness!

00:12.679 --> 00:13.930
Job well done, Emma!

00:14.056 --> 00:15.091
DARK NIMUE:
Now it's time to get to work.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.761
Nimue. Welcome to Storybrooke, love.

00:19.937 --> 00:20.926
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

00:31.114 --> 00:32.103
(WIND BLOWING)

00:33.534 --> 00:35.274
Father! Father!

00:37.079 --> 00:39.286
It's all right, son. I'm here.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.544
See? There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.039
Now, remember,

00:51.134 --> 00:55.127
whenever you feel scared,
all you have to do is look inside.

00:56.682 --> 01:00.391
We're all braver than we think
if we just look deep enough.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.597
Before you know it,
you're going to be a man,

01:02.688 --> 01:04.474
so I'm just trying to prepare you.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.525
Because then you're going
to have to answer life's big question.

01:07.609 --> 01:11.272
What kind of man are you going to be?

01:15.993 --> 01:17.824
I want to be just like you.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.651
(GRINS)

01:19.997 --> 01:21.908
Well, that's a nice answer, son.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.617
Now, close your eyes
and find that brave part

01:26.503 --> 01:28.664
deep inside yourself, hmm?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.336
And you don't have
to worry about a thing.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.752
Your father will watch the light for you.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.713
Just go to sleep, Killian.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.135
Go to sleep.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.156
Liam! Liam, wake up! Father's gone!

02:02.372 --> 02:03.873
You looking for your father?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.581
Look out there.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.659
He rowed away an hour ago.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.460
Rowed away? Why?

02:10.714 --> 02:13.547
Your father ain't what you think.
He's a thief.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.332
A fugitive from the law.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.297
He heard there were soldiers
waiting at the next port,

02:18.388 --> 02:21.425
so he bought my old rowboat and left.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.801
Why would he leave us?

02:22.893 --> 02:24.804
How do you think he paid for the boat?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.348
No. No, he wouldn't do that.

02:31.443 --> 02:35.186
Now you know
what kind of man your father really is.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.747
It would appear I've won.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.252
Oh, did you?

02:57.719 --> 03:01.428
Last time we fought,
this sword ended up in your neck.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.506
You won a battle, not the war.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.262
I took the dagger from you.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.218
Now you have nothing and never will.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.689
Watch it, pirate.

03:09.981 --> 03:10.970
(EXCLAIMS)

03:12.484 --> 03:14.315
Ah! There's the Rumplestiltskin
we know and love.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.148
That is why Belle's left you, isn't it?

03:17.239 --> 03:20.857
She knows just what kind of man
you really are.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.361
And what kind is that?

03:22.452 --> 03:24.568
The kind who loves his power
more than anything.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.321
More than her.
More than your dead son.

03:27.416 --> 03:31.125
Which is why it's so bloody satisfying
to take it away from you. Mmm.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.959
Remember how good it felt?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.128
Power is only as good
as the one who wields it.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.134
And you've done nothing
but parlor tricks.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.209
Oh, is that right?

03:40.303 --> 03:44.046
Well, I think you're really going to like
what's next.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.133
The trick where I finally
get my revenge.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.683
Emma, slow down.
We need to talk about this.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.763
We need a plan.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.149
The plan is find Hook before
he resurrects all of the Dark Ones.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.479
You think dealing with one is bad?

03:57.571 --> 03:58.902
There's more than one Dark One?

03:58.989 --> 04:00.274
It's a long story.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.980
Well, no matter. There's seven of us.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.736
Six. Dopey's still a tree.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.113
We may be down a dwarf,
but we're ready to fight.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.865
We won't have to,
I'm going to take care of this.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.992
-You think you can talk him out of this?
-There's no talking.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.539
We have to hit him
with everything we've got.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.624
Well, it's not his fault.
He didn't want to become the Dark One.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.002
But he did. Because of me.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.457
None of that matters anymore.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.164
Regina's right.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.003
We need to hit him with everything.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.093
This is a man you loved.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.006
That man died back in Camelot.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.182
Now all there is, is the Dark One.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.894
So no matter how hard this might be,

04:32.981 --> 04:35.814
we need to split up,
find him and stop him.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.104
No matter what it takes.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.823
Come on.
This is the fastest way to the harbor.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.876
And you think we'll find Hook
just sipping rum by the sea?

04:55.962 --> 04:57.668
He's not exactly a pirate anymore.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.963
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Take it from a reformed thief.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.877
Old habits die hard.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.713
They certainly do.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.711
Careful who you sneak up on.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.218
Get out of our way, Zelena.
We don't have time for this.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.427
I'd like to have a little chat
about my daughter.

05:10.519 --> 05:11.679
Our daughter.

05:11.770 --> 05:12.850
About that.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.805
I've worked up a teeny alteration
to our custody arrangement.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.560
I've decided to grant myself
sole custody.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.775
See, I'd like to raise her by myself

05:20.862 --> 05:23.353
without you two getting in the way.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.730
I'm going to teach her how to be wicked.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.324
You try and take my daughter from me.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.400
(LAUGHING)

05:29.663 --> 05:30.994
Oh, come on.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.122
There's no point in us fighting over
our darling baby girl,

05:34.209 --> 05:36.165
because soon enough,
you'll both be dead,

05:37.128 --> 05:38.584
and then, I can just take her.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.586
What do you mean, we'll be dead?

05:40.632 --> 05:41.838
Ask them.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.632
Dark Ones! Stand back!

05:48.974 --> 05:52.011
Come on.
We can cover more ground in the truck.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.344
Behind you!

06:13.832 --> 06:15.538
No sign of Hook.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.126
I think our next stop is the Jolly Roger.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.374
HENRY: Mom! Help me.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.080
Too late for that.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.712
Henry.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.634
Henry? Are you okay?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.011
I think so.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.632
Whatjust happened to us?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.184
GOLD: I think I may have
the answer to that.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.519
Check your wrists.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.731
DARK SWAN: What is that?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.565
GOLD: That is the Mark of Charon.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.069
HENRY: Charon?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.523
He was the ferryman in the old myths.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.449
He navigated a boat.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.525
To the UndenNorld.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.656
GOLD: Smart lad.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.281
You see, the Dark Ones only have
a temporary pass into this world.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.707
Like a tourist visa.

07:00.378 --> 07:04.337
The only way for them to stay
is to trade places with living souls.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.502
Meaning us.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.125
Exactly.

07:08.678 --> 07:13.388
And when the moon reaches its peak,
the ferry from the UndenNorld will arrive

07:14.267 --> 07:15.507
and drag us down there.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.093
That doesn't sound good.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.645
Speaking as one
who's died and been there,

07:20.690 --> 07:21.679
it's not.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.807
So, how do we stop it?

07:23.860 --> 07:25.225
We can't.

07:25.320 --> 07:29.359
The UndenNorld is worse
than you can possibly imagine.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.532
It's going to make you wish the old
stories of fire and brimstone were true.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.533
It's going to make you wish for death.

07:34.621 --> 07:38.660
And then the realization will hit
that death has already come.

07:38.708 --> 07:42.041
And this fresh torture is all that's left.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.702
-Gold. You're scaring Henry.
-GOLD: Good.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.378
Because we should all be scared.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.875
This is death itself.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.628
This is a fight we cannot win.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.834
No. I'm not marked.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.093
I'm not going to give up.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.886
There has to be something we can do.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.215
You're right, there is something.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.975
Use this time wisely.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.136
Use it to say goodbye.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.795
REGINA: Thought I might find you
somewhere with a view of the sea.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.017
DARK HOOK:
Well, there's no use in hiding now.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.342
You can't go through with this, Killian.

08:40.812 --> 08:44.475
"Killian?" No "Captain Guyliner?"
No "One-Handed Wonder?"

08:44.899 --> 08:46.355
Where are the bon mots, tonight?

08:46.901 --> 08:49.517
I understand you think
Emma betrayed you.

08:49.946 --> 08:54.155
But do you really think dragging her
family to the UndenNorld is the answer?

08:54.242 --> 08:57.154
This from the woman
who enacted the Dark Curse.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.156
To punish Snow White
for telling a secret.

08:59.664 --> 09:03.828
You, of all people, should know
how far someone will go for revenge.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.080
And unfortunately for you,

09:06.129 --> 09:08.871
so do all the people you've killed
who are waiting for you in hell.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.296
I'm not that person anymore.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.047
Oh, tell yourself what you want, love.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.801
You may be the Dark One,

09:16.139 --> 09:17.800
but we both know

09:17.891 --> 09:21.179
you aren't the man you were
when l recruited you to kill my mother.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.852
When I tested you.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.806
When you... (GASPS)

09:29.486 --> 09:31.818
Not another word.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.818
No. We agreed we would never
speak about this again.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.274
Don't test me again.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.817
Whoever you think I am, I'm not.

09:38.870 --> 09:42.829
You've got no idea
the kind of man I truly am.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.156
(COUGHS)

09:50.048 --> 09:51.037
(HORSE NEIGHING)

10:04.562 --> 10:07.679
If I'd known you were going to take
this long to do your hair,

10:07.774 --> 10:09.514
I'd have had another goblet of wine.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.687
I think you've had enough.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.691
I want you sharp
for what you must do next.

10:15.782 --> 10:16.771
Aye.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.652
I will kill your mother.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.860
And in exchange,
you'll bring me to a land without magic,

10:21.913 --> 10:24.655
where I can finally get my revenge
on Rumplestiltskin.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.449
Indeed.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.961
But first,

10:30.421 --> 10:33.037
I need to know
what kind of man you are.

10:33.716 --> 10:34.876
You don't know my mother.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.587
She is an expert at one thing.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.715
Exploiting weakness.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.676
And I need to make sure you have none.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.885
She sounds lovely.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.388
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.855
Shut up.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.274
Get in the carriage.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.022
A test, is it?

10:55.113 --> 10:57.069
I've been a pirate for over 100 years

10:57.115 --> 10:59.231
and my hook
has tasted the blood of dozens.

10:59.325 --> 11:03.910
Whatever your test, trust me,
I've got the mettle for it, love.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.197
(CHUCKLING)

11:12.046 --> 11:14.037
Gold has to be
missing something, right?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.998
There has to be a way
to escape this mark.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.929
Maybe Gold's right.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.682
Maybe this is a fight we can't win.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.101
Mom, you're Snow White.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.305
You don't know how to give up.
Hope is in your blood.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.855
And I do hope, Emma.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.433
But I don't want to spend
what could be my last moments

11:35.528 --> 11:36.643
with my nose in a book.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.233
I want to make the most
of my moments with my family.

11:45.830 --> 11:46.945
HENRY: Dinner at Granny's.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.325
That's what we should do.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.782
Yeah.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.415
Dinner at Granny's. That's a great idea.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.171
And what about Neal?
He'll be left here all alone.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.340
He won't be alone, Emma.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.709
He'll have you.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.551
I will not give up on my own family.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.596
Emma, we're almost out of time.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.728
And time is what's most important.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.896
Time with those we love.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.318
I know you won't stop trying.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.479
And I hope you succeed

12:20.531 --> 12:23.364
but promise me that you'll
come meet us at Granny's.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.861
Come say goodbye.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.159
I promise.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.866
I love you, Emma.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.743
I love you, too.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.509
So, I hear we're giving up?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.182
DARK SWAN: No. Not tonight. Not ever.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.688
If I can destroy the Dark Ones,

12:52.730 --> 12:56.063
no souls will be owed,
and you will all be spared.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.811
How?

12:57.902 --> 13:01.110
Do you remember the promise
you made in Camelot?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.984
To do whatever was necessary
to get rid of the darkness?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.240
I don't like where this is going.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.160
I need you to keep that promise now.

13:09.247 --> 13:12.159
And I need you to swear
not to tell anyone else.

13:14.127 --> 13:18.245
But to get rid of the darkness,
you still have to put it in someone

13:19.465 --> 13:21.581
and sacrifice them.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.838
Who?

13:27.515 --> 13:28.550
Me.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.809
-You got my message.
-Look, I...

13:42.697 --> 13:44.062
I told you that l...

13:44.157 --> 13:47.490
Here. This will save you from harm
when you're crossing the town line.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.618
Well, that's up to you.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.245
You've always wanted to see the world.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.703
And all of it is right out there

13:55.752 --> 13:58.038

13:58.129 --> 13:59.369
Go when you can.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.251

and when you've tasted it all,

14:02.342 --> 14:03.582

to see you and me.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.660
There is no alternative.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.541
There might be.
But I will need Excalibur.

15:26.384 --> 15:30.718
The only possible way Excalibur
would be of any use would be if...

15:30.847 --> 15:33.304
If Emma takes
all the darkness into herself

15:34.517 --> 15:36.929
and uses the sword to destroy it.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.098
And herself.

16:03.129 --> 16:07.213
Excalibur was always destined
for the hands of a true hero.

make a deal or something?

16:31.616 --> 16:33.481

16:34.076 --> 16:35.737
It doesn't matter.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.697
Right now, all that matters

16:37.747 --> 16:40.329
is I need to be with my family
while I can be.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.657

-No. I can't.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.560
I'm afraid it is, lad.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.608
Look.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.977
The S. S. Purgatory.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.992
Mom, Dad, Henry!

28:26.663 --> 28:28.369
I'm sorry, I tried.

28:28.457 --> 28:29.788
MARY: We know. It's okay.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.957
It's time to drop the act.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.585
You can'tjust sit back

28:35.631 --> 28:38.464
and watch another family be destroyed
to get your revenge.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.381
What makes you think I can't?

28:40.802 --> 28:43.339
Because of what we swore
to never speak of again.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.130
I know the real reason

28:46.225 --> 28:48.841
you don't want to talk about
what you did to your father.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.305
I believe we've already
had this conversation.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.352
But this time you're going to listen.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.271
Because if you don't,

28:55.317 --> 28:57.308
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life,

28:57.486 --> 28:59.693
which, in your case, means forever.

29:00.697 --> 29:05.236
So you have to ask yourself
the same question you did that night,

29:06.078 --> 29:09.570
what kind of man do you want to be?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.007
BOY: I'm scared, Father.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.184
I don't want to leave here
in the morning.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.351
I know,

29:33.605 --> 29:35.345
but we'll be okay.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.643
You and I will find another home.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.275
What matters most
is that we're together.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.069
We can face anything that way.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.864
Now, it's late. Close your eyes.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.654
And remember,

29:47.995 --> 29:49.860
whenever you're scared,

29:49.955 --> 29:52.537
all you have to do is look

29:52.833 --> 29:54.039
inside.

29:55.544 --> 29:59.253
We're all braver than we think
if we just look deep enough.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.458
Sleep tight.

30:02.384 --> 30:04.966
I'll see you in the morning, Liam.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.526
Thank you, Killian.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.232
You named your boy Liam.

30:25.574 --> 30:29.032
After my brother.
After the son you abandoned.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.238
Was he really that easy to replace?

30:31.330 --> 30:32.695
I wasn't trying to replace him.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.905
l was trying to honor him.
To honor you both.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.584
So, now, I'd remember
never to make the same mistake.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.410
-I promise, I've changed.
-No.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.006
People don't change.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.002
I saw what you said to him there.
It's the same thing you said to me.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.254
It was a lie then, and it's a lie now.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.132
Killian, please, that's not true.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.302
l have changed.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.926
I would never leave him.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.641
But you would leave me.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.269
Killian, please, what are you doing?

30:58.398 --> 31:00.730
Deciding what kind of man I want to be.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.644
I might not get what I need.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.946
And I can't have that.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.692
You're just not worth it.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.151
(GRUNTS)

31:18.668 --> 31:19.657
Killian.

31:23.632 --> 31:24.838
It's never too late.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.790
You can change.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.959
Be a different man.

31:42.484 --> 31:43.815
It's time.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.652
No. You are not taking
the people I love.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.317
(CHOKING)

31:55.872 --> 31:59.456
I might not be able to kill you,
but I can stop you from interfering.

32:18.895 --> 32:19.975
That's enough.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.148
What do you think you're doing?

32:23.400 --> 32:25.516
Being the man I want to be.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.521
You can't stop us.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.940
Yes, I can.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.981
Killian, you can't do this.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.361
We both know
there's no other way, love.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.738
We have to hurry.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.316
The darkness won't stay trapped
in Excalibur much longer. Take it.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.446
No.

33:17.579 --> 33:21.071
You have to help me, Swan. Take it.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.786
I can't. It should be me.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.708
Your family needs you.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.245
If anyone deserves to go
to the UndenNorld, it's me.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.163
You were right,

33:30.675 --> 33:32.256
l was weak.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.509
So let me make up for it now
by being strong.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.217
I don't want to lose you.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.141
And I don't want to lose you.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.973
But you have to let me go.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.014
Let me die a hero.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.019
That's the man I want you
to remember, please.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.126
I love you.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.082
I love you, too.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.644
It's okay.

BELLE: Rumple?

36:38.446 --> 36:40.152
What are you doing here?

36:40.782 --> 36:44.149
Henry called. He told me everything.
You lied to me.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.859
-Again.
-Belle...

36:51.835 --> 36:55.327
For the first time,
you were truly selfless.

36:56.673 --> 36:59.164
You know, I don't need to see the world

36:59.259 --> 37:01.375
to know what I want anymore.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.302
What I want is to be with you.

37:54.689 --> 37:58.022
Now, you see, this isn't the library

37:58.109 --> 38:01.897
or Granny's or some bus station,
Ms. Swan. This is my shop.

38:02.530 --> 38:06.068
And unless the sign says "Open,"
you're not invited.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.532
I think l was invited.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.526
I hear whispering.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.205
It's the dagger.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.579
It's calling to me.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.833
-You're upset. Imagining things.
-No, I'm not. It's here, isn't it?

38:16.878 --> 38:18.038
You have it, don't you?

38:23.510 --> 38:25.717
Yes, I do.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.046
(EMMA GASPS)

38:33.436 --> 38:34.596
You're the Dark One,

38:35.814 --> 38:37.270
-again.
-Yes.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.066
How I'd hoped to keep that secret,

38:39.317 --> 38:40.898
wasn't expecting you to hear it,

38:41.110 --> 38:44.978
but then, most ex-Dark Ones are dead.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.320
How is this possible?

38:47.909 --> 38:51.868
When you came to me asking
for the sword, I'd seen an opportunity.

38:52.455 --> 38:56.118
A chance I'd never imagined
would present itself again.

38:56.376 --> 39:00.665
As fate would have it, a small
vial of magic was close at hand.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.579
One sprinkle

39:03.007 --> 39:04.918
and I knew I could get it all back.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.883
I turned the sword into a conduit.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.755
So that while Hook thought
he was destroying the darkness,

39:11.808 --> 39:14.470
he was actually moving it,

39:15.937 --> 39:17.017
channeling it

39:17.772 --> 39:18.932
someplace safe.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.767
Into you.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.561
He had no idea.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.814
And now,

39:25.989 --> 39:28.355
things are as they should be.

39:29.242 --> 39:31.278
Hook sacrificed himself,
and you took that from him...

that you can hurt me?

39:46.801 --> 39:49.884
You found a loophole.
Betrayed us all, again.

39:50.471 --> 39:51.972
It's what I do.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.047
It's the man I am.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.468
Well, then, Dark One,

39:59.480 --> 40:01.607
now that you have your power back,

40:02.108 --> 40:04.440
you're going to do something for me.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.737
And why would I do anything for you?

40:06.821 --> 40:08.982
Because I still have magic.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.655
And I'm willing to bet I can get to Belle
and tell her everything before

40:11.701 --> 40:12.816
you can kill me.

40:12.869 --> 40:13.858
Don't test me.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.576
Don't test me.

40:16.372 --> 40:18.408
You really want to take that chance?

40:18.666 --> 40:21.328
That she will once again

40:21.377 --> 40:24.084
know the kind of man you really are.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.216
What do you want, Ms. Swan?

40:35.516 --> 40:36.722
You're going to hell?

40:37.185 --> 40:38.220
The UndenNorld.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.968
That's quite a distinction.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.763
I'm getting him back.
This isn't fair to Killian.

40:43.066 --> 40:44.806
Gold tricked him.
Everything he gave up

40:44.859 --> 40:45.939
was based on a lie.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.188
Emma, you know how this works,
it's a one-for-one trade.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.065
To get him back,
someone else will have to die.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.521
You just got back
from being the Dark One.

40:51.574 --> 40:52.609
You can't give in to darkness again.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.906
I won't.

40:54.619 --> 40:55.904
I'm giving in to love.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.286
I'm doing this right.

40:58.373 --> 41:01.035
I learned my lesson.
I'm taking a page out of your book.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.162
You two share a heart, so will we.

41:09.008 --> 41:09.997
It could work.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.711
It will work.

41:13.554 --> 41:16.341
Uh, forgive me if I'm
missing the obvious,

41:16.391 --> 41:19.224
but, um, how does one
get to the UndenNorld?

41:26.401 --> 41:27.561
DO it.

41:36.953 --> 41:38.989
Are you sure about this?

41:39.580 --> 41:40.740
DO it.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.895
Hook. lwill find you.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.810
I will always find you.
