Previously on 90210:

00:02.795 --> 00:03.921
Everything's just working
out so perfectly.

00:04.045 --> 00:05.088
We made it through high school,

00:05.213 --> 00:07.007
I inherited a fortune,

00:07.132 --> 00:08.383
and we are going
to live together.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.969
I don't want to
go to college.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.261
All this time, you've
just been pretending

00:11.386 --> 00:12.638
that you wanted to
have a life with me?

00:12.763 --> 00:14.974
I wanted to let you
know that I got a job.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.350
It's on this deep-sea
fishing boat.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.853
I really do hope that you find
whatever you're looking for.

00:18.978 --> 00:21.772
And after you find it, then
you can come and find me.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.022
Ivy and I are engaged.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.609
Because I'm starting
chemo next week,

00:25.734 --> 00:27.653
we want to get married
in the next few days.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.279
My parents have forbidden
me to see you again.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.825
You're an adult now,
and it's your decision, and no!

00:32.950 --> 00:35.035
They've sacrificed a lot
for me. I can't defy them.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.578
I have to tell you something.
Max, I'm pregnant.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.125
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)
Um...

00:42.250 --> 00:45.462
You didn't tell anyone
I'm pregnant, did you?

00:45.587 --> 00:47.088
I mean...

00:47.214 --> 00:48.716
I don't want to...

00:48.841 --> 00:50.676
have to answer questions until
I actually start getting fat.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.597
I'm still getting used
to the idea myself.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.686
You know, um...

01:02.145 --> 01:04.647
We can do this.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.066
You know?

01:06.191 --> 01:07.609
We actually want
to be together.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.530
It's like getting an
accelerated degree in physics.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.449
It's exactly where
we wanted to be,

01:14.575 --> 01:16.076
only faster.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.619
(laughs)

01:22.583 --> 01:23.458
I love you.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.543
I love you.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.506
Hi.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.216
So, your test results
came in.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.634
You are not pregnant.

01:35.679 --> 01:36.471
I had a blood test that...

01:36.597 --> 01:38.640
False positives happen
sometimes.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.601
Otherwise...
everything looks good.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.688
No baby is good.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.356
Are you kidding?

01:46.481 --> 01:47.232
(laughs, sputters)

01:47.357 --> 01:48.358
That's the best news ever!

Oh! I could still go to MIT.
You can go to CU.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.536
We could go on with our
lives like we planned.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.497
I swear, I am never having
unprotected sex again.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.210
Fasten your seat belts.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.297

figure out what I want.

I am so, so sorry,

09:52.633 --> 09:55.262
but Leila--
she's a good kid, I swear,

09:55.387 --> 09:57.264
and it's only a temporary thing
while we figure this thing out.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.681
Navid, I get it.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.142
My sister-- you know,
she took me in, too.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.310
It's going to be fine.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.812
It's going to be
crowded but fine.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.022
(chuckles)

10:06.147 --> 10:07.190
(sighs)

10:07.315 --> 10:09.067
(door opens)

10:09.192 --> 10:10.610
Wait, you guys
are going to bed?

10:11.736 --> 10:13.530
What are you
almost wearing?

10:13.654 --> 10:14.739
I thought we'd go out.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.200
It's midnight, and
you're practically naked,

10:17.325 --> 10:19.119
so probably best
if we all

10:19.244 --> 10:20.912
just get some sleep.
Fine.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.206
Don't even think about doing it.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.376
(door closes)

10:26.501 --> 10:28.920
(both sigh)

10:29.045 --> 10:31.506
I am so, so sorry.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.342
NAOMI:
Unbelievable.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.553
15 houses and they all suck.

10:36.677 --> 10:37.971
How am I supposed to
make a name for myself

10:38.096 --> 10:39.222
without a jaw-
dropping entryway?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.223
I mean, it's
barbaric.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.933
No, you know
what barbaric is?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.185
Liam dropping a ring
on the hood of my car.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.313
Actually, I think
that sounds kind of badass.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.231
Besides, isn't Liam coming back
exactly what you wanted?

10:48.356 --> 10:49.608
Do not be naive, Ivy.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.026
No one finds true
love in high school.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.820
Thank you for not making
that toast at my wedding.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.863
(laughs)

10:55.989 --> 10:57.449
Yeah, you can't expect
Annie to get over Liam

10:57.574 --> 10:58.533
like you got over Max.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.867
Can we stop talking
about high school

10:59.993 --> 11:01.077
and high school boyfriends?

11:01.202 --> 11:03.871
We are college girls.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.499
When I find my
perfect mansion,

11:05.624 --> 11:07.292
I'm throwing a
perfect mansion party.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.503
I am going to have
a big, huge bonfire,

11:09.628 --> 11:10.962
and all us are gonna
throw something in it

11:11.087 --> 11:14.466
that we want to burn because
we wish it never existed.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.343
Too bad Adrianna's
still in Africa.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.344
Whoa.
What?

11:17.469 --> 11:19.095
Silver, Silver.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.096
(laughter)

11:20.221 --> 11:22.474
All right, here goes.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.434
If this house is
lame, I swear to God

11:24.559 --> 11:25.768
I'm firing my real estate agent.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.228
Uh...

11:27.354 --> 11:28.813
definitely not lame.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.981
(gasps)

11:33.818 --> 11:35.694
(gasps)

11:35.820 --> 11:38.114
So many bedrooms.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.824
Can Navid's
sister live here?

11:39.949 --> 11:41.284
Uh, hi, can I live here?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.327
Of course
you can live here.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.995
Ivy and Raj
are living here.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.122
I'm living here.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.415
There's a dipping pool.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.876
Do you know how much
I love to dip?

11:50.001 --> 11:51.670
Oh, my God, this is it,
this is the place.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.671
(all screaming)

11:52.795 --> 11:55.215
(snorts)

11:55.340 --> 11:57.300
(screaming)

11:57.425 --> 11:58.552
Hey, stop
scaring my pig.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.388
Why did a pig just
run through my house?

12:01.513 --> 12:02.263
Well, it's his house

12:02.389 --> 12:03.515
until I finish with repairs,

12:03.640 --> 12:04.807
then it'll be
the new owner's house.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.351
(stammers)
Not yours.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.810
But my real estate agent said
that this house is for sale.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.979
I'm sorry, it's too late,
an offer's been made.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.565
SILVER: I think what he's trying
to say is that

12:11.690 --> 12:12.731
the, uh, the house
has been sold.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.233
Sorry we scared
your pig.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.609
Let's go, Naomi.
Take care.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.319
No, number one...

12:16.444 --> 12:18.071
Yes.
(clicks tongue)

12:18.196 --> 12:20.490
(chuckles)

12:20.615 --> 12:23.410
...I am buying this house,
and number two,

12:23.535 --> 12:25.370
farm animals
do not belong indoors,

12:25.495 --> 12:27.205
contrary to what
you might have seen

12:27.330 --> 12:28.873
on reruns
of The Beverly Hillbillies,

12:28.998 --> 12:30.208
and number three,
I'm most certain

12:30.333 --> 12:32.419
that your employer would be

12:32.544 --> 12:34.962
very angry if he knew
his handyman

12:35.088 --> 12:37.215
was chasing away
significant counteroffers.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.133
Wow, girls like you are
exactly why I'm so happy

12:39.259 --> 12:41.135
to be leaving L.A.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.929
Girls whose parents didn't
meet at the family reunion?

12:43.054 --> 12:44.556
Spoiled brats who think
money buys everything.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.015
It does.
Oh, yeah?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.559
Which is why I'd hate
to have to get you fired.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.977
I mean, how else
will you be able to afford

12:50.103 --> 12:51.521
your Yosemite Sam costume
to go with that hat?

12:54.065 --> 12:56.984
You know... that's
a good point.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.446
I, you know, wouldn't want
to lose my job now, would I?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.489
So I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.907
I'm gonna call the owners

13:03.032 --> 13:04.367
and see if they can't
make you a deal.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.577
How's that sound?

13:05.702 --> 13:06.578
Thank you.
Yeah.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.288
No problem.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.081
What?
Hey, it's Austin.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.751
Yeah, I'm at the
house and a potential
buyer just walked in,

13:12.875 --> 13:17.380
and from the looks of her,
she's, uh, she's loaded. Yeah.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.174
Yeah, so what do you say to an
extra half a million dollars?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.050
What?

13:21.175 --> 13:22.969
Bye, Dad.

13:23.094 --> 13:26.473
Hey, congratulations, he said
you got yourself a deal.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.182
So you're not...?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.435
The help? No.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.147
And my parents weren't related
until after they got married.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.315
Ooh.
Yeah.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.108
It was a pleasure doing business
with you, ladies.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.444
All right.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.201
You fellas look a little young.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.412
How much will this get us?

13:49.537 --> 13:53.124
Whoa, that'll get you the whole
damn bar if you keep it coming.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.250
All right.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.085
King's ready to step down.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.337
NAVID:
Oh, nice.
Yeah.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.631
Wife wants to retire
to the beach.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.133
Huh?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.718
Hey, to women.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.637
Apparently you got to be
drunk to understand 'em.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.221
That's right.

14:11.392 --> 14:11.934
Dude, aah!

14:12.059 --> 14:13.728
Dude, hey!

14:13.852 --> 14:15.522
Yeah, that's right,
I flicked you.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.899
Because you
flicked me up, man.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.234
There's no more room
in the men's dorms.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.153
I'm homeless.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.530
I'm a homeless
black man.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.783
Here, hey, hey, I found this
for you at off-campus housing.

14:26.907 --> 14:27.784
Two-bedroom beach house.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.286
I would kill for a
two-bedroom right now,

14:30.411 --> 14:33.164
okay, but no,
I am giving it to you.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.582
It's not going to
feel like college

14:34.708 --> 14:35.834
if I don't live in a dorm.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.628
Oh, my God, what is up
with you and your sister?

14:38.753 --> 14:40.087
You get handed
exactly what you want

14:40.213 --> 14:41.297
and you're
still not happy.
You think that's

14:41.422 --> 14:44.175
what Annie wanted,
Mr. Let's Do This?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.885
Right.
It was kind of lame,

14:46.010 --> 14:47.721
you just showing up
out of nowhere and proposing?

14:47.846 --> 14:48.847
You didn't even call her
all summer.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.056
I didn't want
to call her

14:50.181 --> 14:51.599
until I knew
what I wanted to say.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.269
What?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.479
Teddy didn't call his dad.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.606
You guys aren't giving him
the look.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.608
I didn't call my dad
because there are some things

15:00.734 --> 15:02.360
you can't just blurt
out, like "I'm gay."

15:02.485 --> 15:04.028
Yeah.
Or "Marry me."

15:04.153 --> 15:05.071
What do you mean, yeah?

15:05.196 --> 15:06.364
Come on,
chicks dig romance.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.699
At least write her a love song.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.492
A love song?
I don't know.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.035
I made a bigger production
when I asked Silver

15:11.160 --> 15:11.952
if I could keep my
toothbrush at her place.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.705
If you're set

15:13.830 --> 15:15.039
on getting Annie
to marry you,

15:15.164 --> 15:16.416
at least do this
thing right.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.340
(door opens)

15:25.466 --> 15:27.009
Hey,

15:27.134 --> 15:30.137
you're back.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.347
What do you think you're doing?

15:31.472 --> 15:32.724
Just hanging out, God.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.184
(toilet flushing)

15:35.309 --> 15:37.186
Is there a boy in here?

15:37.311 --> 15:38.646
(scoffs)

15:38.772 --> 15:40.523
Okay, you know if Navid were
to catch you like this...

15:40.648 --> 15:42.316
All right, party
time is over.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.150
Time to come out

15:43.276 --> 15:45.570
with your clothes on.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.866
Hi.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.618
You're supposed to be in Africa.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.870
Leila let me in.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.996
I wasn't trying
to ambush you.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.207
I just got back and
I need to tell you...
Get out.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.674
Silver, please...
Just get out!

16:08.384 --> 16:09.176
Get out of my place!

16:10.303 --> 16:11.679
Get the hell out!

16:20.229 --> 16:21.147
Scrub this place
from top to bottom.

16:21.272 --> 16:25.151
A pig lived here-- two pigs.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.653
(groans)

16:26.778 --> 16:27.821
I just started
unpacking in my room

16:27.946 --> 16:30.698
and realized it was
the walk-in closet.
(laughs)

16:30.824 --> 16:32.575
Thank you so much for
letting me live here.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.494
I can't believe you got
to move in so fast.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.412
Ugh, after what that hick cowboy

16:36.537 --> 16:37.664
made me pay,

16:37.789 --> 16:38.706
I should have been airlifted in.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.544
Are you okay?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.254
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.758
Um, I just have
to get ready for tonight--

16:48.883 --> 16:49.717
the party and everything.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.385
It's making me crazy.
Oh.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.263
But I did manage to think
of what I'm going

16:54.388 --> 16:56.056
to throw on the bonfire.
Hmm?

16:56.182 --> 16:58.351
My sophomore yearbook because
there is a picture in there

16:58.476 --> 17:00.311
where I almost have bad hair.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.562
(laughing):
Almost.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.481
Hello.
Hi.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.900
IVY:
We are absolutely loving
the guesthouse, most especially

17:06.025 --> 17:07.944
the pot garden in the back.

17:08.068 --> 17:08.944
Ten plants-- seriously,
dude, nice little touch.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.570
RAJ:
Awesome.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.323
ANNIE:
What?
Probably the cowboy.

17:12.448 --> 17:12.949
He reeked of agriculture,

17:13.073 --> 17:14.867
but since I'm

17:14.992 --> 17:17.118
such a "brat,"
maybe I'll call his mom and dad.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.705
He made me pay.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.124
It's his turn.

17:26.796 --> 17:27.839
Thank you.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.966
Oh.
I'm sorry.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.847
Oh.
Sorry.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.349
Ah, the lost freshman look.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.392
Very convincing.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.811
Huh, well, that would be
because I am lost,

17:41.936 --> 17:43.897
and I'm supposed to be
a freshman, just not here.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.356
Now I'm closed out
of all the classes

17:45.481 --> 17:48.067
that actually offer
transfer credit.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.154
And you do not need to hear
about my whole life story.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.447
Not without
knowing your name.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.741
(chuckles)
I'm Annie.

17:54.866 --> 17:55.909
I'm Jeremy.
Ah.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.535
Look, when I
was a freshman,

17:57.660 --> 18:00.663
I stood in the wrong line, wound
up joining the jock fraternity

18:00.788 --> 18:03.541
instead of taking calculus,
but it worked out.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.585
(laughs)
Sometimes when you
don't get what you want,

18:05.710 --> 18:07.003
you may come to realize

18:07.127 --> 18:08.546
that there's something
else that's better.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.967
Hmm, you know what?

18:13.092 --> 18:13.843
You're right.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.262
Thank you.

18:16.387 --> 18:16.763
And hey,

18:16.888 --> 18:18.598
um,

18:18.723 --> 18:21.434
do you maybe want to go
to a party later?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.228
LEILA:
I didn't know you hated her.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.772
Did you really think

18:25.897 --> 18:26.647
you were never going to have
to see Adrianna again?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.858
Call me a dreamer,
but I was kind of hoping

18:28.983 --> 18:30.150
she'd get eaten by a lion.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.904
That's-that's not a
very realistic plan.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.697
Yeah, well, neither is
the three of us living here

18:34.822 --> 18:36.282
together, but I went
along with it.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.368
Look, I'm sorry,
all right?

18:39.493 --> 18:42.914
I just-- us living here
and raising a teenager--

18:43.039 --> 18:44.707
this is not what I planned.
Okay, so you know what?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.543
We'll just... hey, hey,
we'll work this out.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.422
House rules--

18:51.547 --> 18:53.466
no more drinking,
no uninvited guests,

18:53.591 --> 18:55.217
and tonight you clean up
the apartment.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.427
What about Naomi's party?

18:57.971 --> 19:00.180
That is so not fair.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.058
No, Leila.
No.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.310
Do not-- don't go,
don't go in the bathroom.

19:04.435 --> 19:05.895
Please don't get in there,
don't slam the door.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.480
(groans)

19:07.605 --> 19:09.189
Okay, she's back
in the bathroom,

19:09.315 --> 19:10.858
you know, and I, I still got
to get ready for the party.

19:10.984 --> 19:11.859
Look, just,
could you just--

19:11.985 --> 19:13.444
no, take your time, um,

19:13.569 --> 19:14.528
I-I have something
to take care of, um,

19:14.654 --> 19:15.321
I'll meet you at Naomi's.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.031
Wha...?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.658
(sighs)

19:42.515 --> 19:45.101
Hey, um, this is Dixon Wilson.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.435
I'm calling
about the beach house.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.562
It's taken.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.484
I'm, I'm a nonsmoker, good
credit, no pets, call me back.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.194
(chuckles)

19:55.319 --> 19:58.447
Nice try, nice try, but
I already left a message.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.199
Looks like the bull
bucked you off, son.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.035
(chuckles)
Okay, Dad.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.286
Um, see,
the thing is,

20:04.411 --> 20:08.374
a friend really screwed me over
and... I need a place to stay.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.543
And I was supposed
to take my senior year off

20:10.668 --> 20:12.545
and motorcycle
through South America,

20:12.670 --> 20:14.547
but some skinny
Beverly Hills brat

20:14.672 --> 20:16.674
told my parents
I was growing pot,

20:16.799 --> 20:19.593
so, uh... I'm going to need
the place more than you.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.054
So I guess we're just going
to have to see who gets it.

20:21.179 --> 20:24.557
Hmm, yeah, we will.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.195
AMAL:
You've taken on a lot
for a young man--

20:37.319 --> 20:41.115
running the studios, now you're
taking care of your sister.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.575
You need help.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.660
Your father and I used
to do business together.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.495
The business you were in
with my father was porn,

20:46.620 --> 20:48.748
and it almost destroyed
my family.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.211
Really? I mean,
the house

20:53.335 --> 20:55.546
that you lived in, having
your family around you--

20:55.671 --> 20:57.840
those were
the bad times?

20:57.965 --> 20:58.674
Your family
is struggling

20:58.799 --> 21:03.012
not because of me,
Navid, because of you.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.222
You need me.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.182
My family will be fine.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.600
Oh, and Shirazi Studios

21:07.725 --> 21:09.602
will never do business
with a guy like you again.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.356
(camel grunts)

21:14.481 --> 21:17.526
Remember to flex
when you take people's keys.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.612
Hey, lose the gum.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.155
Melanie, please,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.908
more hip roll,
less tuna roll.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.076
Boys, you're not trying
to fly away.

21:25.201 --> 21:25.910
Lightly, lightly.

21:26.035 --> 21:26.911
Naomi.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.495
Lightly.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.832
Naomi, this is amazing.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.459
("Why Even Try"
by Theophilus London playing)

21:33.584 --> 21:34.961
Hey.

21:35.086 --> 21:37.296
(indistinct chatter)

21:37.421 --> 21:39.715
Let's get
the party started.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.301
Thanks for coming, y'all,
let's go, let's party.

22:13.958 --> 22:18.004
Uh, maybe I forgot to warn you
about Naomi's parties.

22:18.129 --> 22:21.132
She kind of has this rule
where you got to come dressed up

22:21.257 --> 22:22.716
or not dressed at all.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.635
Uh, I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.431
I mean, yeah, I'm not exactly

22:29.556 --> 22:31.475
into the whole
mega-party thing, either.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.893
So if you want
to just stay home

22:33.019 --> 22:33.435
and watch a movie,
I'm totally game.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.104
No, you should go to the party.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.563
No, dude, I don't
want to go without you.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.192
Dude, come on,
just come for ten minutes.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.277
I promise, once you're there,
you're gonna feel better.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.611
I can't.
Look, Ivy,

22:42.736 --> 22:45.948
we have been together
the entire summer,

22:46.073 --> 22:47.992
and you spent your
honeymoon in a hospital.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.244
I appreciate
the positive attitude,

22:50.368 --> 22:52.997
but it's okay to admit
that I've got cancer,

22:53.122 --> 22:56.625
and it's okay that I can't live
every moment to the fullest.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.751
But you can.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.338
Go to the party, have fun,

23:00.462 --> 23:01.547
be with your friends.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.174
I'm not gonna die
while you're gone.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.176
Oh, God.
Probably.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.385
That's not funny.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.313
Bye.

23:17.437 --> 23:18.981
Have fun.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.028
(cheering, applause)

23:27.781 --> 23:28.324
All right.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.285
What's everyone
burning?

23:31.409 --> 23:34.247
ANNIE:
Well, I have narrowed it
down to my final report card

23:34.372 --> 23:36.498
or a copy of
Atlas Shrugged,

23:36.623 --> 23:38.500
which totally moved
me at the time.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.044
Wow, that was
deeply impersonal.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.712
Annie, come on.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.047
You have got
bigger issues

23:43.172 --> 23:44.548
than a report
card and a book.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.634
Where are things
with you and Liam?

23:47.760 --> 23:48.552
I don't know what he's thinking,

23:48.677 --> 23:50.554
so I don't know
what I'm thinking.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.807
Report card it is.

23:54.725 --> 23:55.768
NAOMI:
Oh, Annie,

23:55.893 --> 23:57.561
very, very moving.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.354
(laughs):
Silver.

23:58.478 --> 23:59.730
Yes.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.274
Oh, good riddance.

24:01.399 --> 24:02.524
I hated that
piece of wardrobe.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.776
Yeah, that's 'cause

24:03.901 --> 24:05.152
Adrianna gave it to me.
Figures.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.445
What about you, Ivy?

24:07.571 --> 24:08.864
Yeah, um, I think
I'm gonna pass, actually.

24:08.989 --> 24:12.159
I don't think I'm ready to
let go of anything quite yet.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.995
Hey, Naomi, there's a cop
here to see you.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.914
Oh, well, now the party
can get started.

24:17.039 --> 24:19.208
Thank you.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.710
Can I help you, Officer?

24:22.795 --> 24:24.838
Would you be needing
to frisk me?

24:26.799 --> 24:29.051
We received a noise complaint
from your neighbors,

24:29.176 --> 24:30.468
and your valet service

24:30.594 --> 24:31.845
doesn't have the correct
parking permits,

24:31.971 --> 24:34.140
so they've been asked to
find their shirts and go.

24:34.265 --> 24:35.891
You're not a stripper?

24:36.016 --> 24:40.313
Officer Atwood, LAPD.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.939
You know you can't
have an open fire

24:42.064 --> 24:43.274
within 20 feet of
a residence, right?

24:43.399 --> 24:44.442
Um...
Put out that fire.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.071
Well...

24:49.196 --> 24:51.449
(laughs) He would've been
a lot more fun if he was naked.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.160
You want me to
put the fire out?

24:54.285 --> 24:56.245
No.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.205
I have one more thing
I have to burn.

24:59.957 --> 25:00.916
(both laughing)

25:01.041 --> 25:02.460
Um, excuse me.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.169
Hi.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.253
This is a private party.

25:04.378 --> 25:05.338
No hillbillies allowed.

25:05.463 --> 25:07.547
Oh, yeah?
Well, you know,

25:07.673 --> 25:09.216
my new roommate
invited me.

25:09.342 --> 25:12.094
Yeah, and since you and
Dix here are good buddies,

25:12.219 --> 25:14.138
looks like we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.139
Wait, "Dix"?

25:15.264 --> 25:15.889
Yeah.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.308
Thanks. Cheers.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.353
That is a $200 bottle
of champagne!

Ha! Hilarious.

25:54.053 --> 25:54.928
Yeah.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.596
(sighs)

25:56.722 --> 26:00.142
All right, so, how'd
it go with your dad?

26:00.267 --> 26:02.269
It went great. He was, he was
totally fine with me being gay.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.522
So, you didn't
tell him.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.151
We had lunch.

26:09.276 --> 26:12.738
After he left, I sat

26:12.863 --> 26:15.741
and wrote down everything
I wished I could say

26:15.866 --> 26:17.034
without being
afraid of hearing

26:17.159 --> 26:18.911
the judgment in his voice.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.621
(sighs)

26:21.747 --> 26:23.290
Maybe I should just
stick this in the mailbox,

26:23.416 --> 26:24.750
make it easier for everyone.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.627
You are not gonna come out
to your family on a napkin.

26:27.753 --> 26:28.421
(sighs)

26:28.546 --> 26:31.090
Telling people
that you're gay

26:31.215 --> 26:33.591
is not about
doing what's easy.

26:33.717 --> 26:37.971
It's about... not
apologizing for who you are.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.349
So, you're not doing
this for your dad.

26:40.474 --> 26:41.767
You're doing
this for you.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.149
Can I at least get
really drunk first?

26:56.156 --> 26:57.116
Mm-hmm.

26:57.241 --> 26:58.492
Reminds me of the
tour this summer.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.453
It's just like, no
worries about life,

27:00.578 --> 27:01.661
just making music.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.290
Ugh, I wish
I could be like that.

27:04.415 --> 27:05.749
Catch you guys later, okay?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.711
Hey.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.881
Who's that?

27:13.006 --> 27:15.175
A complete stranger
that I invited to Naomi's party.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.844
What?
It was weird.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.222
I was just signing up
for classes at CU,

27:20.347 --> 27:22.640
and then suddenly
I was flirting with him.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.059
What is wrong with me, Dixon?

27:24.184 --> 27:25.603
Maybe it means
that you changed.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.233
Kind of like how I'm
not going to college.

27:31.358 --> 27:34.403
What?! No, Dixon, I don't care
what happens with Marla's money,

27:34.528 --> 27:35.404
you are going to college.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.864
It's not about
the money, Annie.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.950
Look, something
changed this summer.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.995
I was backstage one night,
and the opening act was a guy

27:43.120 --> 27:44.662
just like me.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.874
The sound from the crowd,
it was just like...

27:48.000 --> 27:48.917
(sighs)

27:49.042 --> 27:51.587
I want that.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.255
Well, okay,
but that doesn't mean

Music is.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.054
Oh, there's gonna be excitement.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.183

what Mom says about this.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.184

you the first time.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.207

second time?

29:52.332 --> 29:55.210

the first time

how sorry I am.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.933
Are you finished?

32:57.350 --> 32:59.895
You think switching my meds

33:00.019 --> 33:04.900
and sending me on a bipolar
tailspin was a mistake

33:05.024 --> 33:07.569
because I didn't get
into the college that I wanted?

33:09.321 --> 33:11.448
I was going to kill myself.

33:11.573 --> 33:14.409
I was gonna kill
myself, Ade.

And if Dixon hadn't
shown up and tricked me

33:16.995 --> 33:20.039

I'd be dead right now.

Spent all summer

33:54.115 --> 33:56.284
This is the first
real money I ever made.

33:56.409 --> 33:59.579
Yeah, I hear those boats pay big
'cause the work is so dangerous.

34:15.512 --> 34:19.975

Bad bangs?
A windy hair day?

What?
It's a letter from Max.

37:51.144 --> 37:52.270

Where did you find that?

38:08.369 --> 38:09.454
It was in your yearbook.

38:09.579 --> 38:10.663

that you were going to burn.

38:14.084 --> 38:16.169
If you want to put
the past behind you,

know what it is.

If it'll wipe those sad little
clown looks off your faces,

38:25.762 --> 38:28.473
then I will read the
letter. Here goes.

you don't want to talk to me,

I'm sorry about
the fact that

38:52.831 --> 38:55.458
