Hey, Elaine,
it still raining out?

01:25.234 --> 01:29.934
No. They opened a fire hydrant,
and I've been playing in it.

01:29.968 --> 01:31.367
Oh.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.834
Avast, you lubbers!

01:38.334 --> 01:41.100
What a beautiful day it is.

01:41.133 --> 01:44.000
It's coming down
buckets out there.

01:44.033 --> 01:45.634
The weatherman said

01:45.667 --> 01:48.234
it's going to last
all day long, ha-ha!

01:48.267 --> 01:49.868
You like the rain, boss?

01:49.901 --> 01:51.367
I love the rain, Iggy!

01:51.400 --> 01:53.367
You know why I love the rain?

01:53.400 --> 01:55.501
No, boss. Why, boss, why?

01:55.534 --> 01:57.434
I love the rain

01:57.467 --> 02:00.734
because when it rains
nobody walks.

02:00.767 --> 02:03.100
What is it I always say?

02:03.133 --> 02:05.234
What happens
when it showers?

02:05.267 --> 02:06.234
( <i>drivers grumbling</i> )

02:06.267 --> 02:07.234
Come on. Come on.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.701
What happens when it showers?

02:09.734 --> 02:12.934
ALL:
Big bookings are ours.

02:12.968 --> 02:15.567
And what happens when it rains?

02:15.601 --> 02:18.701
ALL:
Monetary gains.

02:18.734 --> 02:20.167
This is fun.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.701
What happens
when it drizzles?

02:22.734 --> 02:25.267
Shut up, Ignatowski.

02:25.300 --> 02:28.767
What an ear for poetry
that man has.

02:28.801 --> 02:32.934
All right, I've got
an announcement to make here.

02:32.968 --> 02:35.767
All right, attention.

02:35.801 --> 02:36.968
Listen up, here.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.501
I have a personal announcement
to make.

02:40.534 --> 02:44.868
I put my mother in a rest home

02:44.901 --> 02:50.934
so I am having a lavish party
at my now bachelor pad

02:50.968 --> 02:55.901
and none of you cab drivers
are invited.

02:55.934 --> 02:59.267
Oh, you're breaking
our hearts, Lou.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.701
I'm really sorry
that none of you can make it.

03:02.734 --> 03:06.501
What time
should I be there, Louie?

03:06.534 --> 03:08.000
Any time
you want, Latka.

03:08.033 --> 03:09.467
As soon
as you get there

03:09.501 --> 03:11.234
I'm throwing
your foreign butt

03:11.267 --> 03:12.501
down the stairs.

03:12.534 --> 03:17.167
Well, in that case,
I might be a little late.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.934
I can't
believe it, Louie.

03:18.968 --> 03:21.734
I just can't believe
you would celebrate

03:21.767 --> 03:23.834
putting your mother
in a home.

03:23.868 --> 03:26.701
Hey, Rieger, it's not easy

03:26.734 --> 03:29.634
living with your mother
all these years.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.000
There's no privacy

03:31.033 --> 03:33.534
and every day
it's the same thing--

03:33.567 --> 03:35.133
"Louie, eat your dinner."

03:35.167 --> 03:37.300
"Louie, turn down
the television."

03:37.334 --> 03:39.300
"Louie, don't use the doilies

03:39.334 --> 03:41.467
to clean the beer
off your chin."

03:43.601 --> 03:47.234
So what kind of rest home
is your mom in?

03:47.267 --> 03:49.234
Got me.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.801
You mean you didn't even
take her there?

03:51.834 --> 03:53.868
Well, I-I-I took her there.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.534
Not right to the door,
I mean.

03:57.567 --> 03:59.868
You mean you didn't go in
and check the place out?

03:59.901 --> 04:03.601
What the hell do I look like,
Mike Wallace?

04:04.868 --> 04:06.634
I mean,
what's the big deal?

04:06.667 --> 04:07.801
It's a rest home.

04:07.834 --> 04:09.667
( <i>belches</i> )

04:14.934 --> 04:16.733
All right, all right, now

04:16.767 --> 04:19.132
why don't you consumer advocates

04:19.166 --> 04:21.601
line up
for your cab assignments.

04:21.634 --> 04:22.968
( <i>grumbling</i> )

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
There's a city full
of mildewing people out there

04:26.033 --> 04:28.667
just dying
to snuggle up next to you.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.167
Banta, 599.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.067
Rieger...

04:34.100 --> 04:35.667
Okay, Lou.

04:35.701 --> 04:37.234
Say sevenish?

04:37.267 --> 04:39.100
What are you
talking about?

04:39.133 --> 04:40.801
You know, the-the party.

04:40.834 --> 04:42.267
Dress nice.

04:42.300 --> 04:47.033
What on earth would make me go
to a party of yours?

04:47.067 --> 04:48.400
Hold it.

04:48.434 --> 04:50.033
The way I figure it, Rieger,

04:50.067 --> 04:52.067
you're the only guy
in this garage

04:52.100 --> 04:54.734
who won't embarrass me
in front of my friends.
Oh.

04:54.767 --> 04:58.000
And-- let me tell you this--

04:58.033 --> 05:02.267
this is going to be a <i>bash.</i>

05:02.300 --> 05:03.567
Huh?

05:03.601 --> 05:06.267
I'm talking about <i>wild.</i>

05:06.300 --> 05:08.667
Let me give you a little tip.

05:08.701 --> 05:12.601
Make sure you don't have
any holes in your shorts,

05:12.634 --> 05:15.300
if you know what I mean.

05:19.868 --> 05:21.334
You know something, Lou?

05:21.367 --> 05:22.567
I can't believe this,

05:22.601 --> 05:25.400
but I'm actually tempted
to go to that party.

05:25.434 --> 05:26.634
Mmm...

05:26.667 --> 05:28.701
I mean, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

05:28.734 --> 05:31.501
but it's sort of
a nagging curiosity in me.

05:31.534 --> 05:33.968
You know that kind
of morbid curiosity

05:34.000 --> 05:37.434
when you pass a car wreck,
you just got to slow down.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.834
Or when you have
a sore in your mouth

05:39.868 --> 05:41.767
you put your tongue
against it

05:41.801 --> 05:43.200
so you know it hurts.

05:43.234 --> 05:45.734
Or when you have
a container of milk

05:45.767 --> 05:47.667
that you know
has gone sour.

05:47.701 --> 05:51.200
You just got to smell it
before you throw it away.

05:51.234 --> 05:53.267
I can't wait either.

06:03.701 --> 06:05.300
All right.

06:05.334 --> 06:08.234
Here's another one,
here's another one.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.367

( <i>door bell buzzes</i> )

06:14.901 --> 06:16.400
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

06:19.033 --> 06:21.234
Oh, it's not the cops.

06:21.267 --> 06:22.234
Hi, Alex.

06:22.267 --> 06:23.334
Hi, Louie.

06:23.367 --> 06:26.767
All right,
keep it down, guys.

06:26.801 --> 06:28.767
I got
an introduction to make.

06:28.801 --> 06:31.567
Alex, this is Lyle,

06:31.601 --> 06:35.601
Huey, and Daytona Dave.

06:35.634 --> 06:37.400
Have a seat, Alex.

06:37.434 --> 06:39.300
I'll get you a brew.

06:57.601 --> 07:00.534
What did I miss?

07:00.567 --> 07:03.501
No, no. You leave the room,
you got to pay the price.

07:03.534 --> 07:06.367
Boy, the stories
were just flying around here

07:06.400 --> 07:07.701
a minute ago.

07:07.734 --> 07:09.033
Hey, Lyle,

07:09.067 --> 07:11.467
tell Alex the one
about how you woke up

07:11.501 --> 07:13.267
in the morning and your gums

07:13.300 --> 07:14.834
were bleeding.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.734
No, no, no, that's okay.
That's okay.

07:16.767 --> 07:20.567
Don't be repetitious
on my account.

07:20.601 --> 07:22.334
So...

07:22.367 --> 07:25.501
how did, uh... you guys...

07:25.534 --> 07:27.701
ever get together?

07:27.734 --> 07:29.434
You know...

07:29.467 --> 07:31.767
you know how a crowd

07:31.801 --> 07:34.000
always gathers around
on the street

07:34.033 --> 07:36.901
to watch when some guy's
had a heart attack?

07:36.934 --> 07:39.367
We were the last ones to leave.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.434
The ties that bind.

07:42.467 --> 07:44.534
Hors d'oeuvres?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.434
Thank you.

07:49.467 --> 07:51.901
Got to go.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.133
Where you going?

07:53.167 --> 07:55.100
We got another party.

08:03.067 --> 08:06.167
Well, listen,
I hope they have a couch.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.400
Come on, guys.

08:07.434 --> 08:08.767
The evening's young.

08:08.801 --> 08:10.801
It's the shank
of the evening.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.501
It's only 7:30.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.901
Well, if you insist.

08:13.934 --> 08:15.901
Thanks for dropping by.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.067
We ought to do this more often.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.400
Keep smiling.

08:20.434 --> 08:21.767
Boy!

08:21.801 --> 08:24.434
What an evening!

08:24.467 --> 08:26.634
Oh, gosh, it's great
to know guys

08:26.667 --> 08:29.167
you can get silly with
like that.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.701
I'm probably not going
to remember

08:31.734 --> 08:35.467
any of this in the morning.

08:35.501 --> 08:38.033
Are they the only ones
that showed up, Lou?

08:38.067 --> 08:39.634
Well, uh...

08:39.667 --> 08:42.634
I thought a few more people
would come, but...

08:42.667 --> 08:44.367
um...

08:44.400 --> 08:46.701
Hey, I know what we need here.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.000
A little music.

08:48.033 --> 08:50.567
Ma's got a ton of records
over here.

08:50.601 --> 08:52.200
No, thanks, Lou.

08:52.234 --> 08:54.567
You feel like
a little Jerry Vale?

08:54.601 --> 08:55.868
Uh, no.
Thanks, Lou.

08:55.901 --> 08:58.234
I've been listening to him
all day.

08:58.267 --> 09:00.534
Well, look, Lou,
I really got to go.

09:00.567 --> 09:01.467
So soon?

09:01.501 --> 09:02.934
Yeah.

09:02.968 --> 09:04.334
Come on, stick around
for a little bite to eat.

09:04.367 --> 09:05.834
No, that's all right.

09:05.868 --> 09:07.200
Come on. Here.

09:07.234 --> 09:08.434
Here, I'll heat it up.

09:08.467 --> 09:09.501
No, thanks, Lou.

09:09.534 --> 09:11.767
I'd really better shove off.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.868
How about a little TV?

09:13.901 --> 09:15.300
Come on.

09:15.334 --> 09:18.868
No, no... Louie, I don't...
I don't really want to watch TV.

09:18.901 --> 09:22.501
You don't like being here alone,
do you, Louie?

09:22.534 --> 09:25.033
What, are you kidding?

09:25.067 --> 09:28.467
I've been waiting for this
all my life, Rieger.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.567
I love being alone.

09:30.601 --> 09:32.767
Louie...

09:32.801 --> 09:35.801
you miss your mother, don't you?

09:35.834 --> 09:37.901
Get off it, Rieger.

09:37.934 --> 09:39.667
I don't miss her.

09:39.701 --> 09:42.634
I think about her a lot.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.667
Who wouldn't think about her

09:44.701 --> 09:47.133
with all the junk
she left around here?

09:47.167 --> 09:49.701
Look at this stuff.
Geez!

09:49.734 --> 09:53.234
Look. This stupid tea cup.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.501
( <i>tenderly</i> ):
Her little shawl.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.501
She left her little shoes here.

10:15.534 --> 10:18.901
Look at her little shoes, Alex.

10:18.934 --> 10:20.000
No, no.

10:20.033 --> 10:21.100
One shoe.

10:21.133 --> 10:22.100
Come on.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.567
No.

10:23.601 --> 10:26.167
I'm really sorry
I brought her up, Lou.

10:27.734 --> 10:29.334
Yeah.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.400
Well, you're right.

10:31.434 --> 10:34.701
I've been trying to hide it...

10:34.734 --> 10:36.901
but I admit it.

10:36.934 --> 10:39.000
I miss her.

10:39.033 --> 10:41.267
I wish she was here.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.234
Why don't you
call her up?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.567
Tell her to come home.

10:44.601 --> 10:46.300
No, no, no.

10:46.334 --> 10:47.868
You don't understand.

10:47.901 --> 10:49.868
I lied about that, too.

10:49.901 --> 10:52.734
It was her idea to leave.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.734
Oh.

10:54.767 --> 10:59.567
We had that same old argument
we always have.

10:59.601 --> 11:01.467
She burned my dinner.

11:01.501 --> 11:04.801
I called her a name,
she called me a name

11:04.834 --> 11:07.667
and then I hid her teeth.

11:11.133 --> 11:12.667
You hid her teeth?

11:12.701 --> 11:14.267
Yeah. Next thing I know

11:14.300 --> 11:16.567
she's walking
out the door saying,

11:16.601 --> 11:18.501
( <i>lisps:</i> )
"So long."

11:27.300 --> 11:31.234
She never left me before.

11:31.267 --> 11:34.100
If anybody's
going to do any calling

11:34.133 --> 11:35.934
it's going to be her

11:35.968 --> 11:39.367
because a man never begs.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.567
Ma taught me that.

11:46.634 --> 11:50.000
( <i>playing off-key</i> )

12:05.701 --> 12:08.033
I lost ma.

12:15.534 --> 12:18.067
( <i>plays wrong notes</i> )

12:18.100 --> 12:22.133
Look, Lou, I was thinking
about stopping off at Mario's

12:22.167 --> 12:24.234
on the way home for a nightcap.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.701
You want to come along?

12:26.734 --> 12:31.367
Look, Rieger,
I don't want your pity.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.467
If you're inviting me out

12:33.501 --> 12:37.000
like a guy invites his buddy
for a drink, that's okay,

12:37.033 --> 12:39.367
but if you're doing this
out of pity,

12:39.400 --> 12:40.901
well, let's forget it.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.400
It's pity, Lou.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.133
Well, a beer's a beer.

13:04.834 --> 13:07.234
Aw, Louie...

13:07.267 --> 13:08.968
you look terrible.

13:11.801 --> 13:14.300
What are you staring at?

13:14.334 --> 13:16.868
Get your stupid eyes off me.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.734
What, are you
kidding, Rieger?

13:26.767 --> 13:30.067
I'm on top of the world,
sitting on a rainbow.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.467
You been, uh,
spending a lot of time

13:31.501 --> 13:32.834
with those friends
of yours lately?

13:32.868 --> 13:34.467
No.

13:34.501 --> 13:36.634
Lyle shot Huey.

13:36.667 --> 13:39.367
He shot him?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.534
Yeah. It was an accident.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.367
He just wounded him.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.701
Oh.

13:44.734 --> 13:46.934
Six times.

13:46.968 --> 13:50.033
Must put a strain
on their friendship.

Hi, Latka.

It is ten minutes
past the hour.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.868
I know.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.701
But that means I am late.

14:22.934 --> 14:24.300
Louie...

14:24.334 --> 14:27.000
yesterday I snuck out early.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.300
Oh?

14:34.501 --> 14:36.100
Also, I figured out

14:36.133 --> 14:37.901
a way of getting coffee
from the machine

14:37.934 --> 14:40.601
without paying money.

14:40.634 --> 14:43.634
Louie, are you
listening to me?

14:51.834 --> 14:55.133
Hey, uh,
a nice suit you're wearing.

14:55.167 --> 14:58.167
Maybe it will come
back in style.

15:03.434 --> 15:06.000
Is, is, is that a nose,

15:06.033 --> 15:08.667

on the banana?

I don't want to say
you're ugly, but you know...

15:16.567 --> 15:18.667
Don't press your luck, Latka.

15:20.133 --> 15:21.767
Okay, Louie.

15:21.801 --> 15:23.167
I'm sorry.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.133
Boy, I was cooking.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.267
Louie's in bad shape.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.667

for a game of cards?

15:39.701 --> 15:40.968
Are you nuts?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.534
Come on, Bobby, it will help him
take his mind off his mother.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.067
I don't want to.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.467
Come on.
Come on, it wouldn't even hurt
to just invite him this once.

15:47.501 --> 15:48.734
Okay, okay.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.067
You guys can do
what you want,

15:50.100 --> 15:54.100
but I'm playing this game
under protest.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.200
Hey, Lou...

15:56.234 --> 15:58.901
Hey, Louie, how would
you like to come over

15:58.934 --> 16:00.334
and have a game of cards
with us, huh?

16:00.367 --> 16:02.901
( <i>crying</i> )

16:05.067 --> 16:07.701
You want me to play cards
with you?

16:07.734 --> 16:08.901

16:08.934 --> 16:11.400
Look, we're kind of worried
about you, Lou,

16:11.434 --> 16:12.734
so, uh, come on.

16:12.767 --> 16:15.100

Look, Lou, do me a favor,
would you,

16:20.267 --> 16:23.767
and don't mention anything
about your mother, okay?

16:23.801 --> 16:25.334
Okay. She's forgotten.

Come on.

Jeff, you watch the cage
for me here.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.133
I'm going to go play cards
with the guys.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.534
I was invited.

16:40.868 --> 16:42.167
That's nice,
Lou.

Come on, Louie.
And keep your eye
on the shoe.

I was invited to play cards
