00:23.048 --> 00:24.732
The magic Luz's abuela did...

00:24.809 --> 00:26.642
I spoke to Jirou.

00:26.719 --> 00:28.218
I touched him.
He was real.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.904
Give her the baby in this
picture?

00:29.981 --> 00:33.132
The magic only works if the
person in the image is dead.

00:47.857 --> 00:49.715
Oh. Oh, God.

03:17.122 --> 03:19.390
Is it Fourth of July?

03:21.293 --> 03:23.644
No, it's August.

03:23.646 --> 03:24.645
I go look.

03:24.647 --> 03:25.479
No, don't go out alone.

03:25.481 --> 03:26.939
Wait!
Oh...

03:28.467 --> 03:29.467
Yamato-san...

03:31.879 --> 03:34.071
Yamato-san, slow down.

03:48.338 --> 03:50.654
Hey! Hey, son!

03:50.656 --> 03:52.006
Sonny!

03:52.008 --> 03:53.490
What's going on?

03:53.492 --> 03:54.324
We did it!

03:54.326 --> 03:55.176
What?

03:55.178 --> 03:56.178
We got 'em!

03:57.013 --> 03:58.662
We bombed the Japs!

03:58.664 --> 03:59.697
Whoo!

03:59.699 --> 04:01.891
We hit Hiroshima!

04:08.191 --> 04:10.416
They'll have to surrender!

04:49.943 --> 04:54.943

05:18.502 --> 05:20.803
SeÃ±ora, do you need help?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.160
Aguayo?

05:28.162 --> 05:30.754
Aguayo?

05:30.756 --> 05:32.022
We can take you there.

05:39.190 --> 05:43.200
This is our daughter, Esperanza.

06:01.637 --> 06:02.678
Get her inside!

06:04.215 --> 06:05.139
What happened?

06:05.141 --> 06:07.199
Yuko found us.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.368
She's taken Luz and the baby.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.961
- What?
- Let's get her to bed.

06:10.963 --> 06:12.763
- We'll find her.
- Let's go bring her inside.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.206
Hector,

06:14.208 --> 06:15.816
can we borrow your truck?

06:15.818 --> 06:17.151
Yes, yes, of course.

06:17.153 --> 06:18.711
Why don't I come with you?

06:18.713 --> 06:20.237
Stay with your grandmother.

06:35.879 --> 06:38.413
Chester, watch out
for military tonight.

06:38.415 --> 06:40.082
It's no place for Japanese folks

06:40.084 --> 06:41.658
so close to Los Alamos.

06:41.660 --> 06:44.403
Did something happen tonight?

06:44.405 --> 06:45.971
In the war?

06:47.424 --> 06:49.642
Do you know where Hiroshima is?

08:08.489 --> 08:10.505
<i>8:15 a.m. local time,</i>

08:10.507 --> 08:12.099
<i>the United States
detonated a bomb</i>

08:12.101 --> 08:14.751
<i>over the Japanese port city
of Hiroshima.</i>

08:14.753 --> 08:16.419
<i>This is reportedly
the largest bomb</i>

08:16.421 --> 08:18.831
<i>ever detonated in human history.</i>

08:39.520 --> 08:41.211
Luz...

08:43.207 --> 08:44.715
Luz!

08:49.697 --> 08:50.697
Yuko-san?

09:04.636 --> 09:05.944
Oh, my god...

09:08.974 --> 09:10.899
Luz...

09:10.901 --> 09:13.643
The <i>yurei.</i>

09:13.645 --> 09:14.720
She's taken him.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.413
Where did she take him?

09:17.875 --> 09:18.875
In the car.

11:07.777 --> 11:09.259
The whole world's falling apart,

11:09.261 --> 11:12.095
and people are celebrating.

11:12.097 --> 11:13.505
As though a child in Hiroshima

11:13.507 --> 11:15.282
had anything to do
with this war.

11:20.939 --> 11:24.458
I wanted revenge once.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.627
It consumed me.

11:26.629 --> 11:30.631
I thought getting it
would ease things,

11:30.633 --> 11:34.176
but I didn't feel any better.

11:36.880 --> 11:41.124
Major Bowen want to kill you.

11:41.126 --> 11:43.977
It was either him or you.

11:45.964 --> 11:49.983
You did only thing you can.

11:49.985 --> 11:51.634
But I didn't...
How did you...

11:51.636 --> 11:52.636
Shh!

11:53.897 --> 11:56.615
Only our own people know.

11:58.226 --> 11:59.701
It's all right.

12:00.979 --> 12:05.574
If WRA not find out by now,

12:05.576 --> 12:07.584
they never will.

12:10.322 --> 12:11.338
You see...

12:13.417 --> 12:19.162
it easy to want vengeance.

12:19.164 --> 12:20.806
Natural as death.

12:24.186 --> 12:27.062
What about you?

12:28.599 --> 12:31.024
I cry more tear

12:31.026 --> 12:33.268
come back from camp

12:33.270 --> 12:37.698
than at camp.

12:37.700 --> 12:40.534
All we had...

12:40.536 --> 12:44.037
gone.

12:44.039 --> 12:46.856
Gone.

12:46.858 --> 12:48.625
Give him to me.

12:48.627 --> 12:51.194
Give me my baby!

12:51.196 --> 12:52.329
We will stay with her.

12:52.331 --> 12:54.006
Don't worry.
Go find the baby.

12:56.402 --> 12:57.551
I'm going now.

12:57.553 --> 12:59.778
I'll get him back.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.221
I'm coming.

13:01.223 --> 13:02.055
I'm coming with you!

13:02.057 --> 13:03.281
Lie back.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.559
Chester will get him.

13:10.215 --> 13:11.439
You haven't called the police?

13:11.441 --> 13:12.840
About the couple in the car?

13:12.842 --> 13:13.716
No, no.

13:13.718 --> 13:14.718
Good.

13:15.887 --> 13:17.362
I need you to
take me back there.

13:41.897 --> 13:43.597
Was there anyone else
in the car?

13:44.708 --> 13:45.840
Just them.

13:51.981 --> 13:55.758
I didn't do it...

13:55.760 --> 13:56.760
I didn't do it.

13:59.690 --> 14:02.950
It was the woman,

14:02.952 --> 14:04.368
with... with the baby.

14:05.937 --> 14:10.182
We'll take you
to a doctor, okay?

14:10.184 --> 14:13.085
Can you please
tell me what happened first?

15:09.743 --> 15:12.594
It was a good day, wasn't it?

15:12.596 --> 15:14.246
Yes.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.857
It was.

15:16.859 --> 15:19.609
It's nice to keep your mind
on other things.

15:30.039 --> 15:32.097
Asako-san...

15:32.099 --> 15:34.949
I would like some more broth.

15:34.951 --> 15:36.376
Yes, of course.

15:36.378 --> 15:38.253
Right away.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.694
What are you doing?

19:05.303 --> 19:06.219
Stay back.

19:06.221 --> 19:08.830
I'll go in myself.

19:08.832 --> 19:10.740
Then what?

19:10.742 --> 19:12.425
She'll just give you the baby?

19:12.427 --> 19:15.428
My baby isn't Taizo.

19:15.430 --> 19:18.006
The baby she wants
is from 25 years ago.

19:18.008 --> 19:20.249
Do you still have
the picture on you?

19:20.251 --> 19:21.601
I haven't forgotten it.

19:21.603 --> 19:23.603
I just need you to do it.

19:49.464 --> 19:50.371
She must have hidden here

19:50.373 --> 19:52.132
for months.

19:52.134 --> 19:53.134
Preparing.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.694
Carving stones,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.638
waiting for the baby to come.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.974
Sutras on the walls...

20:00.976 --> 20:03.368
No.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.871
Not sutras.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.274
Names.

20:17.159 --> 20:19.242
Her ancestors.

20:20.403 --> 20:23.555
Your ancestors.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.206
Dozens of them.

20:26.618 --> 20:28.585
She's preparing for a burial.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.824
I have to go. Now.

20:34.826 --> 20:36.067
Go where?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.510
The limestone quarry.

20:37.512 --> 20:39.328
The stones are from
the other side of the woods.

20:39.330 --> 20:40.780
I know the path from here.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.740
No, listen, boy.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.184
There's a better way.

20:44.186 --> 20:45.352
We just need some time.

20:45.354 --> 20:47.354
There is no time.

20:47.356 --> 20:49.764
She's taken my child.

20:49.766 --> 20:52.025
Now, please,

20:52.027 --> 20:55.320
promise me you'll give
the picture to Luz's <i>abuela.</i>

21:00.944 --> 21:02.118
God damn you.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.869
The trees
in the photo of you in Japan.

21:19.871 --> 21:22.037
They're the same as here.

21:22.039 --> 21:24.349
She's here, I know it.

21:26.228 --> 21:28.395
How much farther?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.023
Yuko-san.

24:16.731 --> 24:18.690
Pop, no!

24:22.796 --> 24:24.612
Find Ma! We need
another picture.

24:41.072 --> 24:43.423
Hold this.

24:43.425 --> 24:46.092
Do not let go.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.654
A sutra?

24:49.656 --> 24:50.656
Why?

24:55.478 --> 24:57.312
Pop, no, she'll possess you.

25:20.703 --> 25:22.353
We tried that at camp.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.463
It didn't work.

25:23.465 --> 25:24.522
It did work.

25:25.425 --> 25:27.191
It trapped her.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.860
Until we burnt it off.

25:28.862 --> 25:30.194
Now, go!

25:30.196 --> 25:31.712
Get out of here.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.320
Aah!

25:47.489 --> 25:49.322
Chester!

25:49.324 --> 25:51.199
Run!

27:32.819 --> 27:33.968
No!

27:55.617 --> 27:56.617
Chester!

27:57.693 --> 27:58.934
The grave.

27:58.936 --> 28:00.119
She went in the grave!

28:07.020 --> 28:09.128
Oh, my god...

28:12.542 --> 28:13.542
Henry.

28:14.544 --> 28:15.544
Henry!

28:18.622 --> 28:20.031
Hen...

28:20.033 --> 28:21.808
Henry!

28:24.962 --> 28:26.604
Henry!

28:36.065 --> 28:37.065
Come on.

28:52.823 --> 28:54.257
Get the baby!

28:55.568 --> 28:56.843
Go. Go.

28:56.845 --> 28:58.135
Asako-san.

28:59.614 --> 29:00.738
Asako-san, come on.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.306
Come on.

29:07.963 --> 29:08.929
The sutras...

29:08.931 --> 29:09.931
My father brought them.

29:11.767 --> 29:13.084
They trap the spirit.

29:24.855 --> 29:25.855
Luz, stay back!

30:00.133 --> 30:01.932
Stop, Ma! Stop!

30:03.052 --> 30:04.911
Stop!

30:04.913 --> 30:07.138
Ma, stop!

30:07.140 --> 30:08.656
Stop!

30:08.658 --> 30:10.541
She can't be killed!

30:20.169 --> 30:21.169
We can't destroy her.

30:23.414 --> 30:27.174
Her spirit will never rest.

30:27.176 --> 30:29.435
She'll find a way somehow.

30:31.180 --> 30:32.229
Chester...

30:33.590 --> 30:36.233
Maybe there is a way.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.352
Chester!

37:26.354 --> 37:27.519
Son?

37:27.521 --> 37:29.337
Stop dreaming.

37:29.339 --> 37:31.023
Are you taking the photo or not?

37:49.451 --> 37:51.335
Okay. Good.

38:20.649 --> 38:24.576
I never told anyone this before.

38:24.578 --> 38:26.662
Do you know why
I became a fisherman?

38:29.825 --> 38:31.324
I thought that's all there was.

38:31.326 --> 38:32.701
No.

38:32.703 --> 38:35.754
I became a fisherman
because in the water,

38:35.756 --> 38:40.384
there's none of the cares
of the world over there.

38:43.172 --> 38:46.490
I was a bachelor here
for so long,

38:46.492 --> 38:50.160
I named my boat "Taro."

38:50.162 --> 38:51.395
"First-born son."

38:53.757 --> 38:55.774
But when your mother came over,

38:55.776 --> 38:58.018
and we adopted you,

38:58.020 --> 39:02.673
the most miraculous
thing happened.

39:02.675 --> 39:06.285
I felt the same calmness.

39:07.955 --> 39:12.683
When I held my boy in my hands,

39:12.685 --> 39:16.920
all the cares of the world
vanished.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.257
My <i>taro.</i>

39:26.156 --> 39:28.640
I think today,

39:28.642 --> 39:33.461
I'm going to sail out
into the ocean...

39:33.463 --> 39:36.389
far, far away from the world

39:36.391 --> 39:39.443
and all its troubles.

39:41.805 --> 39:44.214
Come on.

39:44.216 --> 39:45.574
Let's go together.

39:48.645 --> 39:51.722
I can't, Pop.

39:51.724 --> 39:53.123
I've got too much to do.

39:55.151 --> 39:56.919
I understand.

39:59.340 --> 40:03.842
How about taking
one more picture?

40:03.844 --> 40:06.160
Something to remember this day?

40:06.162 --> 40:07.996
Yeah.

40:07.998 --> 40:09.681
Sure.

40:27.276 --> 40:29.660
You got it?

40:30.854 --> 40:33.021
Yeah.

40:33.023 --> 40:34.790
I got it.

41:02.311 --> 41:04.886
Shh.

41:11.561 --> 41:14.246
Hey...

41:14.248 --> 41:18.584
it's time to say goodbye
to your <i>ojichan.</i>

41:18.586 --> 41:22.403
I wish he could've been with us
a little longer,

41:22.405 --> 41:25.165
see the war end,

41:25.167 --> 41:30.578
maybe even see
your mom and I settle down.

41:30.580 --> 41:34.749
You know what his name is, son?

41:34.751 --> 41:37.919
Henry.

41:37.921 --> 41:41.732
Yeah. Just like yours.

43:21.375 --> 43:22.282
Yamato-san!

43:22.284 --> 43:25.268
It's Genzo.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.954
Ah, little Genzo.

43:27.956 --> 43:30.774
Look at you.

43:30.776 --> 43:32.366
Where were you?

43:32.368 --> 43:33.701
Manzanar.

43:33.703 --> 43:34.386
My whole family.

43:34.388 --> 43:35.445
You?

43:35.447 --> 43:37.781
Colinas de Oro,

43:37.783 --> 43:40.875
but now I am in Hawaii,

43:40.877 --> 43:43.895
with my great nephew.

43:43.897 --> 43:46.306
Everybody there Japanese.

43:46.308 --> 43:47.899
We went to Indiana.

43:47.901 --> 43:50.402
No one there is Japanese,

43:50.404 --> 43:52.362
but that's where
a farm took us in.

43:56.301 --> 43:57.301
Hey, Mama.

44:01.656 --> 44:03.731
Save some for the
others, Yamato-san.

44:03.733 --> 44:05.308
I can barely keep up.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.567
You make these?

44:06.569 --> 44:07.586
Yeah.

44:07.588 --> 44:08.736
Oh my.

44:08.738 --> 44:09.755
Enjoy.

44:12.926 --> 44:13.926
Hey.

44:19.174 --> 44:21.249
No appetite?

44:21.251 --> 44:23.769
Bad memories.

44:23.771 --> 44:25.103
I hate that every time

44:25.105 --> 44:26.846
I come back to see my people,

44:26.848 --> 44:28.523
it gives me nightmares.

44:30.510 --> 44:33.928
But your babies are beautiful.

44:33.930 --> 44:36.281
I want to adopt more.

44:36.283 --> 44:37.282
I'd take them all
from the hospital

44:37.284 --> 44:38.284
if I could.

44:39.269 --> 44:41.160
Chester would
probably like that,

44:41.162 --> 44:45.106
and little Henry too.

45:30.504 --> 45:33.079
This is why we have <i>Obon,</i> son,

45:33.081 --> 45:35.748
to remember,

45:35.750 --> 45:38.068
not just the people we knew,

45:38.070 --> 45:41.237
but the places we've been.

45:41.239 --> 45:45.742
We have to make sure
we keep remembering, okay?

45:45.744 --> 45:48.836
Or else we forget who we are.

47:43.637 --> 47:48.637
