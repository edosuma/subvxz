Mads, I'm home.

00:03.959 --> 00:05.417
-You have to stay in here.
-Why?

00:05.417 --> 00:08.084
This visitor you're
concerned about?

00:08.084 --> 00:09.500
She calls herself
Sutton Mercer.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.834
And she's gonna be making
a lot of crazy claims.

00:13.209 --> 00:14.458
I never laid a hand on Mads--

00:14.458 --> 00:16.417
I know. I know.
You're not stupid.

Ms. Sutton Mercer!

You're the best thing
that's happened to me
since I got here.

00:29.583 --> 00:31.000
I'm not gonna let you go.

00:33.042 --> 00:34.875
Derek, I've got
another job for you.

00:34.875 --> 00:37.209
-I thought we were done.
-You're gonna like this one.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.041
-What if you stayed?
-Why should I?

00:46.291 --> 00:49.042
Our birth mother, Annie Hobbs.

00:49.042 --> 00:52.583
I think this is her
with Ted and Alec.

00:52.583 --> 00:55.875
-Do not let this girl anywhere
near Ms. Hobbs, understood?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:01.917 --> 01:05.167
[sighs] Ah! Now that was
an amazing night.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.917
The decorations,
the dresses, the dancing.

01:10.417 --> 01:12.125
Me, Justin.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.208
You, Ethan.

01:14.084 --> 01:16.083
Yeah, it was fun.

01:16.083 --> 01:17.250
Fun?

01:18.208 --> 01:21.166
That's it? We're rocking
sparkly headgear here.

01:21.166 --> 01:24.167
I mean, how many chances
will both Mercer sisters get

01:24.167 --> 01:25.500
to be Cinderella
on the same night?

01:25.500 --> 01:27.084
Okay, you're right.

01:27.084 --> 01:30.667
[sighs] But, you know,
just remember that

01:30.667 --> 01:33.167
in the Cinderella story,
when the clock struck midnight

01:33.167 --> 01:35.084
it all turned to crap.

01:35.084 --> 01:37.208
Well, that's cheerful.
[chuckles]

01:37.208 --> 01:39.041
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts about Ethan

01:39.041 --> 01:41.417
because to everybody
who saw that kiss tonight,

01:41.417 --> 01:42.750
you guys are officially
a couple.

01:43.917 --> 01:45.250
Believe me, I know.

01:47.542 --> 01:50.125
Hey, do you ever think about

01:50.125 --> 01:52.125
who Mom and Dad dated
in high school?

01:52.125 --> 01:53.500
Besides each other.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.291
Uh, no. [chuckles] Gross. Why?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.917
Well, I found this.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.667
[gasps] Oh, my God,
it's Dad and Alec
with some random girl.

02:07.667 --> 02:10.000
Yeah, I was wondering
if you knew who that was.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.250
No. Check out those totally
bitchin' fingerless gloves.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.750
Why are we talking
about this person?

02:18.084 --> 02:19.375
Probably Ethan saying
goodnight

02:19.375 --> 02:21.209
so I'll leave you two alone.

02:24.041 --> 02:27.291
Oh, by the way, you missed
midnight by ten minutes.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.084
-Guess we escaped the pumpkin.
-[ringing continues]

02:42.209 --> 02:44.125
Hey.
Ah, I'm so glad you called.

02:44.125 --> 02:46.167
So, you're not
gonna to believe this--

02:46.167 --> 02:49.375
Wow, I guess congratulations
are in order, Your Highness.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.917
Oh, you heard.

02:51.917 --> 02:55.250
Please, your coronation
was all over the class website
the second you won.

02:55.250 --> 02:58.792
I mean, it was your name
they announced.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.959
I was just kind of like
your stand-in. So...

03:01.750 --> 03:04.917
Congratulations... You.

03:04.917 --> 03:07.708
Look, they expected
you to run.

03:07.708 --> 03:10.750
And anytime I...
I didn't want to.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.959
It's like I had
this big neon sign

03:12.959 --> 03:15.625
with an arrow above my head
saying "not Sutton."

03:15.625 --> 03:19.000
Kissing Ethan, that was just
part of being me, too?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.417
I don't know.

03:21.417 --> 03:24.875
[stammers]  Uh,
it just happened
really fast and...

03:24.875 --> 03:27.041
Look, that's not
important right now.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.708
I have something
much more important.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.458
Really? Much more important
than kissing my boyfriend?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.792
Annie Hobbs
was from Scottsdale

03:35.792 --> 03:37.500
and Ted and Alec knew her.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.000
Wow. That is her.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.875
Your dad ripped it out
of the photo album.

03:41.875 --> 03:44.166
It's like he didn't want
me to see it or something.

03:44.166 --> 03:47.250
Look, I know you're
making progress in L.A.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.542
But I think that there
are answers in Phoenix.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.042
Just come home, Sutton.

03:51.042 --> 03:53.750
And while you're at it,
take your life back.

Babe, did you use
all the shampoo?

03:56.542 --> 03:58.792
-[Sutton]  Thayer.
-Oh, my God, is that...

04:00.291 --> 04:02.250
It's not what it looks like.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.959
Okay...

04:04.959 --> 04:07.042
I'm crashing with him
for a few days.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.166
so I covered you up.

04:55.417 --> 04:57.000
What'd you do
to Eduardo last night?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.250
Whoa, easy. I didn't do
anything to Eduardo.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.792
We just had a nice long talk.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.708
-About what?
-Lots of things.

He's a sharp guy.
I can see why you like him.

The good news is
he explained everything.

You had a crush on him.

He didn't really feel
the same way.

Long story short,
nothing physical happened.

what I've been saying.

05:18.167 --> 05:21.250

-No catch.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.708
I spent years trying
to control Thayer

work out.

Yeah.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.959
I'm putting a lot of trust
in you, Mads.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.166
You could do the same for me.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.708
So I was four years old,

06:01.708 --> 06:03.125
and I kept pestering
my parents

06:03.125 --> 06:05.583
to get me this
kid's miniature golfing set,
right?

06:05.583 --> 06:08.083
Hey, never too early to
introduce a kid to the game.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.458
Uh, not necessarily.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.000
I had the thing
for five minutes

06:11.000 --> 06:12.917
before my mom got
caught in my backswing

06:12.917 --> 06:14.834
while she was loading
the dishwasher.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.083
-Emergency room.
-Ouch.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.792
-Sixteen stitches.
-Ooh!

06:17.792 --> 06:19.083
Yeah, that's not
the worst part.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.542
She had to address a realtors'
conference the next day

06:21.542 --> 06:23.291
with this fat, fat lip.

06:23.291 --> 06:24.792
I'm so sorry, Justin.

06:24.792 --> 06:27.542
Didn't you say your...
Your father was a realtor?

06:27.542 --> 06:30.291
Yeah, actually they're
a husband and wife team.

06:30.291 --> 06:33.125
Back in Portland, they even
had those bus bench ads

06:33.125 --> 06:34.417
with their picture together.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.250
Totally embarrassing.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.208
Oh, we all know how parents
can be like that sometimes.

06:39.208 --> 06:42.167
Uh, Mom, can I talk to you
over here for just a second?

06:44.291 --> 06:47.166
One thing you'll come
to notice about
my daughter, Justin,

06:47.166 --> 06:49.208
she lacks subtlety.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.708
I'll try and remember
that, sir.

06:51.708 --> 06:54.250
-Why are you giving my
boyfriend the third degree?
-What?

06:54.250 --> 06:56.209
I'm just asking
about his parents.

06:56.209 --> 06:58.875
No, you were grilling
him about his parents.

06:58.875 --> 07:03.000
Okay. Laurel, look, your dad
and I are very fond of Justin.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.084
I just... [sighs]
I find it a little strange

07:06.084 --> 07:08.834
he's been at our house for
breakfast three days in a row,

07:08.834 --> 07:10.458
he's gone golfing
with your dad

07:10.458 --> 07:12.667
and we've never
met his parents,
never had a...

07:12.667 --> 07:14.042
Okay, well, they
just moved to town.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.792
-You heard how busy they are.
-Have you met them?

07:16.792 --> 07:20.750
Not yet,
but maybe I can fix that.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.834
Hey, Justin, um, what are you

07:27.834 --> 07:29.708
and your parents
doing tomorrow night?

07:29.708 --> 07:32.166
Tomorrow? Uh,
I'll have to check with them

07:32.166 --> 07:34.084
but I'm pretty
sure we're free.

07:34.084 --> 07:36.000
Perfect.
Then my family would love

07:36.000 --> 07:38.208
to have your family
over for a barbecue.

07:38.208 --> 07:42.000
Sounds great.
My parents have been looking
forward to meeting you guys.

to meeting them.

are you doing in my pool?

Our pool man is old,
has a mustache, his name...

know his name,
but he's definitely not you.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.000
What can I say? You got me.

with the mustache.

-Derek.

-Your name's Darrell Derek?
-No, just Derek.

seconds until I call the cops.

barge in on you like this.

for a guy like me
to get the attention

08:42.000 --> 08:43.500
of someone like you,

08:43.500 --> 08:46.166
I had to do
something... Extreme.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.834
I see.

08:48.834 --> 08:53.000
And why is my... Attention
so important to you?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.834
and went swimming
in your pool.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.875
No, see,
that's your interpretation.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.667
Speaking of bad boys,
how's everything

11:02.667 --> 11:04.667
with Eduardo after the
whole photo incident?

11:04.667 --> 11:06.167
Well, I still
owe him an apology

11:06.167 --> 11:07.708
but at least now my dad knows

11:07.708 --> 11:09.208
that nothing happened
between us.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.291
Oh, Ms. Diaz, is Eduardo here?

11:13.291 --> 11:15.208
Eduardo doesn't
work here anymore. He quit.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.000
Wait, what?

11:19.708 --> 11:20.792
Why would he do that?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.583
My son told me about
what happened.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.208
All she had to do was be me
just for a little while,

11:37.208 --> 11:40.750
keep a low profile, maintain
the status quo, but no.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.667
Look, if you hate
what Emma's doing so much,
why don't you just go home?

11:43.667 --> 11:46.375
Now? After all the
hard work we've done?

11:46.375 --> 11:49.125
Look, we are, like,
one lucky break away

11:49.125 --> 11:51.834
-from finding my mother.
-That's the spirit.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.083
Plus, if you left now,
I'd kind of miss you.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.000
Speaking of which,
why were you so bothered

11:56.000 --> 11:57.750
that Emma knows
we're staying together?

11:57.750 --> 12:00.042
I mean, we did just...
You know.

12:00.042 --> 12:02.792
-Yeah, about that...
-You know what,
don't tell me.

12:02.792 --> 12:05.333
Too much drama,
too busy looking for your mom.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.000
And you're okay with that?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.583
Oh, I didn't say that.
Hey, here it is.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.792
[Sutton]
See?

12:13.792 --> 12:16.041
What did I just say?
Lucky break.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.625
Yep. Although our timing
may not be so great.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.084
Why?

12:20.084 --> 12:21.959
Because they're closed
until November.

12:21.959 --> 12:23.792
What? November?

12:23.792 --> 12:26.125
No. We're-- We're so close.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.583
I know. Look, we have
a phone number

12:27.583 --> 12:29.375
so we'll keep calling
until we reach someone.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.333
And what if we don't, Thayer?
I have to go home.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.084
I can't stay here
till November.

12:33.084 --> 12:34.375
And you won't have to, okay?

12:34.375 --> 12:36.917
Don't worry.
Whatever happens,
I'll think of something.

12:36.917 --> 12:39.625
-What makes you so sure?
-Because that's what I do.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.667
Besides, I haven't let
you down so far, right?

12:49.792 --> 12:51.417
You're here early.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.875
Yeah, got here first
thing to look through

12:53.875 --> 12:55.625
these old yearbooks
from the library.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.625
Thought if Ted and Alec
knew Annie

12:57.625 --> 12:59.792
that maybe they went
to school together.

12:59.792 --> 13:01.834
-Any luck?
-Nope.

13:01.834 --> 13:05.125
[sighs] Just pages and pages
of faces, but no Annie yet.

13:05.125 --> 13:08.792
Of course, I am only
halfway through 1984, so...

13:08.792 --> 13:10.458
Hey, you want to see
a picture of Ted

13:10.458 --> 13:11.875
playing the lead in  Brigadoon?

13:11.875 --> 13:14.500
Thanks, but I'm good.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.458
Actually,
I kind of had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.125
Okay.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.917
All right,
I was thinking about
what you said last night

13:22.917 --> 13:25.167
and you're right.

13:25.167 --> 13:28.417
Being together like this,
it's... It's not working.

13:31.166 --> 13:33.500
No, yeah, of course not.

13:35.375 --> 13:36.917
So I've made a decision.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.250
I'm gonna break up
with Sutton.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
What are you doing here, Mads?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, I left you
four messages last night.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.083
-You're moving?
-Yeah. Back to Chicago.

14:06.083 --> 14:10.166
-Eduardo, I talked
to my dad.
-Trust me. It's too late.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.000
Too late?
No, that's ridiculous.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.542
Look, we'll just go back to
the way things were before

14:14.542 --> 14:16.875
and you'll be my
choreographer, nothing else.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.333
-It won't work.
-Why not?

14:18.333 --> 14:20.792
Because I can't, okay?

14:20.792 --> 14:23.167
Mads, the other day,
when I came by your house,

14:23.167 --> 14:25.000
it wasn't just because
I was worried about you.

14:27.291 --> 14:28.792
It's because I had to see you.

14:30.708 --> 14:32.583
Everything you've felt
between us...

14:33.208 --> 14:35.333
I felt it, too.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.166
So I'm not just
some girl with a crush?

14:38.209 --> 14:39.375
[exhales deeply]

14:48.834 --> 14:50.166
[breathes deeply]

14:51.000 --> 14:53.250
-You need to go.
-Now?

14:53.250 --> 14:55.583
-Yeah.
-No, this is crazy.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.417
Eduardo, what is going on?

14:57.417 --> 15:00.084
I can't tell you.
Just trust me, okay?

15:00.084 --> 15:01.208
About what?

15:02.375 --> 15:04.041
You're not making any sense.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.125
What went on the other night
between you and my dad?

15:08.125 --> 15:10.458
All I can say is it's not
just about you and me

15:10.458 --> 15:12.417
or that picture
of us together.

15:12.417 --> 15:14.291
So what are you saying?

15:14.291 --> 15:16.458
I'm saying it's dangerous.
Now go.

15:22.959 --> 15:24.834
[cell phone ringing]

15:27.417 --> 15:29.625
Hey, sexy. How was practice?

15:29.625 --> 15:33.917
Uh, it was fine.
Listen, I got some
not so great news.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.041
Everything okay?

15:36.041 --> 15:39.000
Yeah, it just looks like
the Miller family might have
to take a rain check

15:39.000 --> 15:40.959
on the barbecue tonight.

15:40.959 --> 15:43.834
Oh, no. Seriously?

15:43.834 --> 15:46.291
Yeah. My parents got called
out of town for work.

15:46.291 --> 15:48.000
Apparently,
the bank pulled out

15:48.000 --> 15:49.542
of some huge deal
last second.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.125
You gotta be kidding.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.166
No, my mom is...
She's really embarrassed

15:54.166 --> 15:56.250
and she said that
we'll host next time.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.834
-Just bad timing, I guess.
-Yeah, I guess.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.959
Or maybe it's perfect timing.

16:03.959 --> 16:05.041
How do you figure?

16:05.041 --> 16:07.500
Well, I mean,
your parents are gone

16:07.500 --> 16:10.041
and you're all alone
in that house.

16:10.041 --> 16:12.125
Yeah, that does
sound pretty great.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.917
Although...

16:14.917 --> 16:16.583
"Although"?

16:16.583 --> 16:18.000
I've got two papers due,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.333
and I've got a huge tournament
at Seton Prep tomorrow.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.959
And something tells me
if you came over...

16:25.792 --> 16:28.209
Laurel? You there?

16:28.209 --> 16:32.084
Yeah. Just... Disappointed,
that's all.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.209
So I understand
everyone's been

16:37.209 --> 16:40.375
talking about
you and Ethan at school.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.417
To tell you the truth,
things have gotten
a little out of hand.

16:45.125 --> 16:48.083
Oh. Well, if you ever
want to talk about it...

16:49.375 --> 16:50.875
Actually,
there is something...

16:52.417 --> 16:54.750
You were offering, right?

16:54.750 --> 16:56.458
-Of course.
-Okay.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.792
So, before Ethan
and I were together,

16:59.792 --> 17:01.750
he was with someone else.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.000
Actually,
technically still is.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.333
Oh. Sutton, honey, that's--

17:06.333 --> 17:09.083
Horrible. I know. [laughs]

17:09.083 --> 17:12.792
But the thing is, I think
she's cheating on him.

17:12.792 --> 17:15.000
Wait, does Ethan know?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.792
No, but he keeps
saying that he's gonna
break up with her anyway

17:17.792 --> 17:19.084
so I don't know
if I should

17:19.084 --> 17:20.708
just stay out of it or...

17:20.708 --> 17:23.750
Uh, put yourself
in Ethan's shoes.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.291
[inhales deeply] I mean,
I'd probably wanna know.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.041
[footsteps approaching]

17:28.041 --> 17:30.834
Well, you can stop cooking.
Barbecue's off.

17:30.834 --> 17:32.875
-Why?
-Oh, no. What happened?

17:32.875 --> 17:35.209
Apparently, Justin's parents
had some work thing.

17:35.209 --> 17:36.750
And I know
what you're thinking.

17:36.750 --> 17:40.000
I'm not thinking anything.
I'm-- I'm just disappointed.
Like you.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.708
What are we gonna do
with all this food?

17:41.708 --> 17:44.125
Dad's practically
cooking a cow out there.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.125
[Kristin] Well, Justin's
still coming, right?

17:46.125 --> 17:49.125
No, he said he needs
to rest up for golf.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.875
A sport routinely played by
80-year-olds, I might add.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.875
Well, since he's
fending for himself

17:53.875 --> 17:55.625
why don't you
bring him a plate?

17:55.625 --> 17:57.500
I'm not even sure
he wants me over there.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.792
[Emma]
You and food?

17:58.792 --> 18:00.583
Throw in a trip to
the driving range

18:00.583 --> 18:03.000
and you have hit
Justin's trifecta.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.792
I guess. But I don't even
know where he lives.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.875
Actually,
the student directory
arrived today

18:07.875 --> 18:09.959
and I'm sure
Justin's address is in it.

18:09.959 --> 18:11.792
I think it would be
a lovely gesture.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.667
Oh. Hey. You're here.

18:20.667 --> 18:24.000
-I mean, you didn't leave.
-I'm sorry. Can I help you?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.792
I'm Laurel.
But you probably know that.

18:26.792 --> 18:28.875
I'm just bringing your son
some barbecue.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.542
My son is eight months old.
Who are you here to see?

18:32.875 --> 18:35.000
Uh, Justin Miller.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.667
I think you have
the wrong address.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.209
Sorry, is this
11805 Norton Drive?

18:39.209 --> 18:40.917
-It is.
-Oh, okay.

18:40.917 --> 18:44.209
Um, must be a mistake.
[chuckles nervously]

18:47.083 --> 18:48.708
Wait. Um...

18:48.708 --> 18:51.208
Justin said that his dad's
always playing
pranks and stuff.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.959
You're not messing with me,
are you?

18:52.959 --> 18:55.167
Young lady, I think
someone's messing with you.

19:07.209 --> 19:09.542
[chattering indistinctly]

19:09.542 --> 19:12.500
-Hey. So I have great news
about the art gallery.
-Mmm-hmm.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.084
According to their website,
the Annie Hobbs exhibit

19:15.084 --> 19:16.750
went up last week before
the gallery closed,

19:16.750 --> 19:19.542
meaning it's possible
that the paintings were
delivered recently.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.084
[gasps] Okay, don't tell me,

19:21.084 --> 19:23.000
you hacked into the
delivery company's computers

19:23.000 --> 19:24.458
and got Annie's address.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.959
Even better. I went in their
dumpster and I got

19:27.959 --> 19:29.667
every single packing
slip in there.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.333
If Annie's paintings
were delivered
within the last week

19:32.333 --> 19:35.084
that means
that they probably came
from one of these addresses.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.125
-[internet call alert ringing]
-Oh, hey, maybe that's Emma.

19:39.125 --> 19:40.750
You can tell her
the good news.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.083
It's Ethan.

19:43.083 --> 19:45.959
Okay. I'll give you a minute.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.083
Well, well,
if it isn't Ethan Whitehorse.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.917
You know, I almost
didn't recognize you

19:56.917 --> 20:01.083
without your rent-a-tux
and my twin sister
stuck to your face.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.917
[sighs]  Emma told me you saw
the pictures from homecoming.

20:03.917 --> 20:07.291
Hmm. You guys just tell each
other everything, don't you?

20:07.291 --> 20:09.000
-This isn't about her.
-Really?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.667
That wasn't my sister
that you were

20:10.667 --> 20:14.042
kissing the other night
in front of 600
of my closest friends?

20:14.042 --> 20:17.667
Oh, wait, was that
just another one
of her accidents?

20:17.667 --> 20:20.500
-It was no accident.
-Excuse me?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.458
Why do you even care?

20:22.458 --> 20:25.500
I mean, how important
could I possibly be to you?

20:25.500 --> 20:28.125
You took off for L.A.
without telling me.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.042
You won't even be seen
in public with me.

20:30.042 --> 20:31.208
Okay, you know what, Ethan?

20:31.208 --> 20:33.250
I can't have this conversation
right now.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.083
Things are very complicated.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.125
Okay, I'm gonna make it
really easy for you.

20:38.917 --> 20:41.750
Sutton, you and I are over.

20:55.084 --> 20:56.625
You okay?

20:56.625 --> 20:58.041
Of course, yeah. Why?

20:58.041 --> 20:59.917
Your palm is sweating.

21:01.167 --> 21:03.458
I talked to Sutton.
We don't have to hide anymore.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.250
You mean except for
that whole thing

21:05.250 --> 21:09.084
where people besides you
think I'm someone else?

21:10.625 --> 21:13.583
So Sutton really
didn't freak out?

21:13.583 --> 21:15.708
She wasn't happy.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.792
But she also knew
that we weren't
going anywhere as a couple.

21:18.959 --> 21:20.834
She didn't say anything else?

21:20.834 --> 21:24.667
Like, say,
about another guy in L.A.?

21:24.667 --> 21:26.125
What, like a movie star
or something?

21:27.125 --> 21:29.000
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.083
She was cheating on me
with Shia LaBeouf, wasn't she?

21:32.208 --> 21:35.166
All right.
Enough about Sutton.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.875
Tonight is our
first official date.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.500
I can't wait.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.500
[sighs]

21:51.042 --> 21:53.291
-[bell ringing]
-Hey. I've been
looking for you.

21:53.291 --> 21:55.166
And now you found me.

21:57.542 --> 21:59.917
Well, gotta get to class.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.875
[stammers] Wait, wait, wait.
Is--

22:01.875 --> 22:03.500
Everything okay?

22:03.500 --> 22:06.291
I... I don't know.
You tell me.

22:06.291 --> 22:10.209
Well, I was going to say
that my tournament
at Seton Prep got postponed

22:10.209 --> 22:13.542
and I thought maybe I could
swing by your house tonight
and we could watch a movie.

22:13.542 --> 22:14.792
Sounds great.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.959
Or maybe we could watch
one at your house this time.

22:18.125 --> 22:20.084
-[chuckles nervously]
-[bell ringing]

22:20.084 --> 22:21.417
Yeah, I, um, you know what?

22:21.417 --> 22:23.792
I got a lot of algebra
to do anyway.

22:23.792 --> 22:25.542
Guess I'll just take
a rain check.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.084
[exhales deeply]

22:39.125 --> 22:40.959
Hey, honey.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.750
-Hey.
-How are you?

22:42.750 --> 22:44.458
Um, not bad.

22:44.458 --> 22:47.167
[Alec] How was school?
Anything cool happen?

22:47.167 --> 22:48.250
[Madeline] No, not really.

22:50.667 --> 22:53.834
-I saw Eduardo.
-Oh, yeah?

22:53.834 --> 22:56.625
He's, uh, he's moving
back to Chicago.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.291
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Right.

23:00.333 --> 23:02.583
You know, he did say something
that was kind of weird.

23:02.583 --> 23:05.875
He said that he wasn't
leaving because of me

23:05.875 --> 23:08.000
or what happened
with the picture.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.959
-He said that there was
something else, something...
-Something what?

23:12.583 --> 23:15.208
Dad, what really happened
with you and Eduardo?

23:16.959 --> 23:18.000
I don't know
what kind of thoughts

23:18.000 --> 23:20.042
he's putting in your head,
Mads, but

23:20.042 --> 23:24.000
absolutely nothing happened
between me and Eduardo, okay?

23:37.250 --> 23:39.750
-Hey, Sutton.
-Hey.

23:39.750 --> 23:43.042
-You... You got a sec?
-Yeah, sure. What's up?

23:43.042 --> 23:44.750
Promise not to say
anything to Mom and Dad.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.084
Especially not Mom.
[chuckles nervously]

23:47.084 --> 23:48.708
Of course. What's going on?

23:48.708 --> 23:50.917
Okay, remember when
I went to Justin's

23:50.917 --> 23:52.834
yesterday to take him dinner?

23:52.834 --> 23:55.458
He wasn't there.
That's not his house.

23:55.458 --> 23:58.834
Oh. Well, maybe you
just had the wrong address.

23:58.834 --> 24:01.125
No. Right address.
I even checked with
the school office.

24:01.125 --> 24:02.417
He just doesn't live there.

24:02.417 --> 24:05.084
I mean, how crazy is that?

24:05.084 --> 24:08.875
Well, Laurel, it might not be
as crazy as it seems.

24:08.875 --> 24:10.375
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe

24:10.375 --> 24:12.333
Justin's parents
just aren't around?

24:12.333 --> 24:13.625
What do you mean?

24:13.625 --> 24:16.291
I mean, maybe he's on his own.

24:16.291 --> 24:18.959
You know, he could be
sleeping in his car

24:18.959 --> 24:21.708
or a youth shelter,

24:22.375 --> 24:23.834
abandoned house...

24:23.834 --> 24:27.208
Seriously? I mean,
why would he lie
about something like that?

24:27.208 --> 24:31.250
I think you need
to be in Justin's shoes
to understand.

24:31.250 --> 24:34.000
Not everybody
is as lucky as you...

24:34.333 --> 24:37.291
And I are.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.417
So how do you know so
much about this stuff?

24:40.875 --> 24:43.041
I had to watch a documentary
in social studies.

24:43.041 --> 24:44.625
About street kids?

24:44.625 --> 24:47.250
Yeah, street kids.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.166
Hey, why don't you
just ask him what's going on?

24:49.166 --> 24:51.333
[laughs softly]
Any other ideas?

24:51.333 --> 24:53.000
Okay, well,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.834
if he's using that house
as his mailing address,

24:55.834 --> 24:58.333
chances are he's staying
someplace nearby.

25:05.041 --> 25:07.209
[door opening]

25:07.209 --> 25:10.417
[Thayer] There you are, right
where I left you.

25:10.417 --> 25:13.291
Indian food.
Oh, and I even splurged

25:13.291 --> 25:15.917
and went to the place
without all the
health code violations.

25:15.917 --> 25:18.375
-How's progress going
on those packing slips?
-Huh?

25:18.375 --> 25:20.875
You were gonna
check out those addresses?

25:20.875 --> 25:24.333
Yeah. Uh, I didn't exactly,
uh, get to them.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.542
Sutton, I've been gone
for three hours.

25:26.542 --> 25:29.583
-What were you doing?
-[sighs] Um, I don't know.

25:30.834 --> 25:33.834
-Homecoming pictures again?
-I know. I'm sorry.

25:33.834 --> 25:36.042
You know, it's not just your
time you're wasting here.

25:36.042 --> 25:38.041
I know. I'm going
to do them right now.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.959
You stay in my apartment,
you eat my food.

25:39.959 --> 25:41.291
I went through
a dumpster for you.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.792
[laughs] Are you trying
to make me feel guilty?
Because it's working.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.042
I am sorry for everything.

25:46.042 --> 25:49.041
Whoa. Everything?
Does that mean you're sorry
we slept together, too?

25:49.041 --> 25:51.042
You really don't want me
to answer that question.

25:51.042 --> 25:52.250
The guy broke up with you,
Sutton.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.458
What, are you
spying on me now?

25:54.458 --> 25:56.333
Wait a minute. No, wait.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.667
Let's just put all of our
cards out on the table.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.417
You didn't just accidentally

26:00.417 --> 26:02.375
walk into that webcam
the other night.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.542
-You wanted Emma to see you.
-Okay, so what if I did?

26:04.542 --> 26:06.333
Unlike some guys,
I'm not gonna wait around

26:06.333 --> 26:08.625
until you decide
whether or not I'm good enough
to tell people about.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.291
Where are you going?

26:12.291 --> 26:14.083
I'm getting out of here
for a couple days.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.333
Just so you know, when I
get back, you better be gone.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.792
-Okay.
-[Ethan] Good. One more.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.500
-Oh! Oh!
-[Ethan] Good.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.333
-Okay, don't get me wrong.
-Uh-huh...

26:27.333 --> 26:30.625
I am so happy that this is
our first official date

26:30.625 --> 26:32.291
but you have to know
something about me,

26:32.291 --> 26:34.084
surprises make me
really nervous.

26:34.084 --> 26:35.166
-It's okay.
-Okay.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.167
I think you're
gonna like this.

-Can I take this thing off?
-Here.

26:58.959 --> 27:01.500
-Ethan.
-You like it?

27:03.125 --> 27:04.500
I love it.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.209
It's perfect.

27:07.250 --> 27:10.209
No one has ever done anything
like this for me before.

27:11.875 --> 27:15.375
Well... It's about
time someone did.

27:21.166 --> 27:22.875
I have to tell you something.

27:24.375 --> 27:26.291
Yes?

27:26.291 --> 27:28.208
It's something that I've
been meaning to tell you

27:28.208 --> 27:30.917
and I don't know if I should.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.209
It's okay, Emma,
you can tell me.

27:35.708 --> 27:37.583
Sutton is staying
with Thayer in L.A.

27:37.583 --> 27:39.083
and I think they're
sleeping together.

27:40.500 --> 27:43.708
What? Sutton and Thayer?

27:43.708 --> 27:46.834
I saw him on the webcam.
I wanted to tell you earlier.

27:46.834 --> 27:48.792
-But I--
-Well, you didn't.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.583
I mean... Damn it, how long
have you known about that?

27:51.583 --> 27:54.209
-Just a couple of days.
-A couple of days?

27:54.209 --> 27:56.083
Yeah, I didn't think that...

27:57.458 --> 28:00.375
Wait a minute. Why are you
freaking out about this?

28:00.375 --> 28:02.000
I thought you and I
were together now.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.041
That has nothing to do
with it, all right?

28:04.041 --> 28:05.792
You shouldn't have
even waited a second

28:05.792 --> 28:07.708
to tell me something
like that.
What are you doing?

28:07.708 --> 28:11.167
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I thought that if I told you,

28:11.167 --> 28:13.500
you would
break up with Sutton,
and then I wouldn't

28:13.500 --> 28:15.625
be able to tell if you
were choosing me for me

28:15.625 --> 28:18.083
-if we ended up together.
-You know what?

28:18.083 --> 28:20.250
You're not gonna
have to wonder
about it either way now.

[woman]  I work in the E.R.

Hello?

Anybody here?

If I'd have known you were
coming, I would've cleaned up.

it's not too much?

30:40.583 --> 30:42.000
I know we're going
to the country club,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.333

wants to take me to, like,

30:44.333 --> 30:46.875
-an illegal
street racing event after?
-[chuckles]

30:46.875 --> 30:50.083
Then you would
be the hottest girl

Look, I know you're
blaming yourself

30:56.750 --> 30:59.167
for whatever happened
with Ethan, but

30:59.167 --> 31:02.166
whatever did happen,
I'm sure he overreacted.

31:02.166 --> 31:04.125
What did you lie
about, anyway?

31:04.125 --> 31:06.000
Does it matter?

31:06.000 --> 31:09.042
Point is, there was
something I should have

31:09.042 --> 31:12.084
told him and I didn't.

31:12.084 --> 31:15.125
Oh, so you didn't even lie,
you just withheld.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.750
-Same thing.
-No, it isn't.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.208
He should forgive you.

-Sutton, could you
do me a huge favor?
-Yeah. Of course.

31:28.667 --> 31:30.417
I left my purse
on the dresser upstairs.

-Well, see, I was swimming--
-School.

31:55.917 --> 31:57.542
We actually met at school.

31:57.542 --> 31:59.792

See you later, Sutton.

-Yeah. Nice meeting you.

32:10.750 --> 32:13.750
Well, Derek seems
like a nice boy.

32:13.750 --> 32:17.042
So, Sutton, what are
your plans for the evening?

32:17.042 --> 32:19.875
Actually, Mrs. Chamberlin,
if you had a second,

32:19.875 --> 32:22.583
I was hoping I could
ask you a quick question.

32:27.959 --> 32:30.583
Damn. You know, I left
my sunglasses in the house.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.208
-I'll be right back?
-Sure.

32:36.083 --> 32:38.000
[exhales deeply]

32:38.000 --> 32:40.625
Who are you to ask me
something like that?

32:40.625 --> 32:43.458
I'm sorry.
[stammers] I just never
noticed that picture.

32:43.458 --> 32:46.000
If I'd have known
Annie was such
a sensitive subject--

32:46.000 --> 32:47.333
If you'd known?

32:47.333 --> 32:50.209
Sutton, you've been coming
to this house for 16 years.

32:50.209 --> 32:52.667
Have you ever once heard
anyone mention that name?

32:52.667 --> 32:55.125
No, it was just
such a coincidence.

32:55.125 --> 32:57.250
I saw this picture
of her with my dad and Alec

32:57.250 --> 32:59.083
and I was just wondering
what happened to her.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.291
Then why don't you
ask them what happened?

33:01.291 --> 33:04.792
Those bastards
broke her heart, both of them.

33:04.792 --> 33:07.458
They're the reason Annie left
for L.A. and never came back.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.000
[Alec]
Maddie, where you been?

33:15.000 --> 33:16.208
The hospital.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.125
Eduardo was in a crash.

33:18.125 --> 33:19.500
Oh, my God. What happened?

33:19.500 --> 33:21.291
I don't know, the, um...

33:21.291 --> 33:23.458
The cops think
he fell asleep at the wheel.

33:23.458 --> 33:25.042
Sweetheart, I'm awfully sorry.

33:25.042 --> 33:26.458
No, Dad, stop it.

-You did this.
-I'm sorry?

33:29.208 --> 33:31.083
I know you tried to
pay him off or something.

happened if it wasn't for you.

33:33.417 --> 33:34.917

I know you're upset,
but listen to yourself.

33:37.708 --> 33:40.000
You honestly think I had
anything to do with this?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Actually, that sounds
about right to me.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.125
What's wrong, Dad?
I thought you'd be happier
to see me.

33:57.458 --> 34:01.209

told me, you know.

What? That I'm living
like a bum in some
abandoned house.

It's humiliating.

34:07.083 --> 34:09.708

Well...

You could start by telling me
what's going on here.

That wasn't a lie.

34:31.250 --> 34:34.917
Three years ago, my parents
were killed in a car crash.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.291
Oh, my God.

34:39.291 --> 34:41.083
I didn't have any
family to move in with

34:41.083 --> 34:44.834
and so child services
assigned me to this couple

34:44.834 --> 34:46.333
in a little town up north.

34:46.333 --> 34:47.625
And they were nice people,

34:47.625 --> 34:49.417
but they had their hands full
with three other kids.

34:50.375 --> 34:53.750
I'd always been a good golfer.

34:53.750 --> 34:56.333
And even before
my parents died,
I knew that a scholarship

34:56.333 --> 34:58.667
was my only way
to a good college.

34:58.667 --> 35:01.041
But my new school,
they didn't even have a team.

35:02.167 --> 35:04.208
So you just took off?

35:06.000 --> 35:09.625
I chose Arizona
because it was far enough

35:09.625 --> 35:11.542
and Arroyo because
it has one of the best

35:11.542 --> 35:13.458
high school golf
programs in the country.

35:14.375 --> 35:16.166
I hated lying to everyone,

35:17.291 --> 35:19.166
especially you, but...

35:19.166 --> 35:23.166
Laurel, if this
gets out, I'm finished.

35:23.166 --> 35:26.917
No scholarship, no college.
I know it's a lot to ask--

35:26.917 --> 35:29.209
Justin, I'm-- I'm not
going to tell anybody.

35:30.042 --> 35:31.375
Why not?

35:32.208 --> 35:34.875
Because I believe in you.

35:36.875 --> 35:38.041
Besides,

35:38.041 --> 35:41.083
why would I want
to turn in the best boyfriend
in the world?

35:41.750 --> 35:43.000
[both laughing]

35:45.084 --> 35:47.167
[Kristin]
I just wish you had
come to me first.

35:47.167 --> 35:50.125
I could've told you
talking to Phyllis
about Annie is a bad idea.

35:50.125 --> 35:52.834
She was very upset
when she called me.

35:52.834 --> 35:55.250
Trust me, I wouldn't
have brought it up

35:55.250 --> 35:57.375
if I'd known she'd
flip out on me like that.

35:57.375 --> 35:59.041
What's the deal there?

35:59.041 --> 36:01.834
You guys went to high school
with Annie, right?

36:01.834 --> 36:05.000
Yeah, she was a couple
of years younger than
your father and me

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
and very sweet,
kind of troubled.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Had this wild streak
about her.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.417
Phyllis said
she had moved to L.A.

36:13.417 --> 36:16.375
Did you and Dad ever,
like, run into her

36:16.375 --> 36:18.667
when he was doing
his residency there?

36:18.667 --> 36:22.250
[Kristin] No. I mean,
if she was there,
we didn't know it.

36:22.250 --> 36:25.583
Then again, we were
never really that close.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.375
Thanks for getting dinner.

36:36.375 --> 36:39.167
I had no idea
these fancy clubs
don't take personal checks.

36:39.167 --> 36:40.458
Well, it's still early.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.291
Maybe I'll let you
buy me dessert.

36:42.291 --> 36:44.375
[cell phone ringing]

36:46.125 --> 36:47.542
Oh, I gotta take this.

36:47.542 --> 36:49.166
-Just be a sec.
-Mmm-hmm.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.167
Hey.

36:52.167 --> 36:54.625
So I'm at your country club.
This place is sweet.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.625
Great. I'm glad you like it.

36:56.625 --> 36:58.667
I'll put you on the waitlist
for a club membership.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.542
What's going on with Char?

37:01.542 --> 37:03.000
Well, I was at her
place earlier.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.458
I overheard Sutton
talking with Phyllis.

37:06.209 --> 37:07.250
About?

37:07.250 --> 37:08.917
Well, Sutton
was asking questions

37:08.917 --> 37:11.167
about someone named Annie

37:11.167 --> 37:13.500
and then your name came up
and some other dude...

37:13.500 --> 37:15.250
-Ted.
-Yeah.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.125
I don't think Phyllis
likes you guys very much.

37:18.041 --> 37:19.417
Then what happened?

37:19.417 --> 37:21.708
[laughs] Phyllis kind of
freaked out on Sutton

37:21.708 --> 37:25.458
and said everything
was all your fault.
Meaning you and Ted.

37:25.458 --> 37:28.000
-I wish I had more.
-Trust me, that's plenty.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.959
Thanks.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.708
Hey, Char.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.500
Everything okay?

37:43.500 --> 37:44.875
What the hell
were you thinking,

37:44.875 --> 37:46.375
breaking up
with Sutton like that?

37:46.375 --> 37:48.959
You were so lucky to have her,
and now you're gonna

37:48.959 --> 37:52.042
-throw it all away because
of some little omission?
-Come here.

37:52.042 --> 37:55.000
A, keep your voice down
'cause you're going
to get me in trouble.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.291
And, B, do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

37:58.041 --> 37:59.333
Not exactly.

37:59.333 --> 38:01.792
I didn't think so.

38:01.792 --> 38:04.583
Why don't we just keep this
thing between me and Emma?

38:07.542 --> 38:09.042
Who's Emma?

38:11.125 --> 38:13.917
-That's not what I meant.
-[Char gasps]

38:13.917 --> 38:15.583
You're cheating on Sutton?

38:15.583 --> 38:17.042
[stammers] No.

38:17.042 --> 38:19.084
[cell phone ringing]

38:20.959 --> 38:22.041
Oh, my God.

38:22.041 --> 38:23.375
What's the matter?

38:23.375 --> 38:25.625
-Derek?
-Yeah, right here.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.625
We've got to get to
the hospital, now.

38:27.625 --> 38:31.291
Char, listen to me
for a second, okay? I--

38:31.291 --> 38:34.208
If I were you, I'd save
the explanations for Sutton.

38:34.208 --> 38:37.542
I'm sure she'll love
to hear all about Emma,
whoever that is.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.042
Hey. How is he?

38:53.042 --> 38:57.125
I don't know.
He's out of surgery, but no
one's telling me anything.

38:57.125 --> 39:00.333
Sutton, I have something to
tell you, but it's kind of bad

39:00.333 --> 39:01.834
so maybe now's not the time.

39:01.834 --> 39:03.375
Char, after everything
that's happened,

39:03.375 --> 39:05.041
what could possibly
make things worse?

39:05.041 --> 39:06.750
It's about Ethan.

39:06.750 --> 39:10.291
Char, you have to let me
explain what happened
earlier, okay?

39:10.291 --> 39:11.834
You got the wrong idea
about this.

39:11.834 --> 39:13.708
Well, if I'm so wrong,
then why are you here?

39:13.708 --> 39:18.125
Sutton, Ethan's
been cheating on you
with someone named Emma.

39:18.125 --> 39:20.041
He let it
slip out at the club.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.333
So tell us, Ethan, who's Emma?

39:25.208 --> 39:27.792
I think that's a pretty good
question. Right, Sutton?

39:33.084 --> 39:34.083
[Ethan]
Thayer.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.917
-[Sutton] Ethan!
-[Char gasping]

39:37.875 --> 39:39.083
[exhales deeply]

39:49.041 --> 39:51.500
Hey, I got your message.
Everything all right?

39:51.500 --> 39:53.708
Not really.

39:53.708 --> 39:55.333
I think we might
have a little problem.

39:55.333 --> 39:56.875
[Ted] I think we have
more than one.

39:56.875 --> 39:59.041
Sutton's been asking
questions about Annie.

39:59.041 --> 40:01.458
I'm just starting to think
there's no way
out of this thing.

40:01.458 --> 40:04.083
-Maybe we should just...
-No, Ted.
There's always a way.

40:06.792 --> 40:08.084
Here's what we've gotta do.

40:13.125 --> 40:15.042
[Sutton]
It's a psychiatric hospital?

40:17.917 --> 40:19.708
Well, this ought to be fun.

40:36.125 --> 40:38.000
Excuse me.

40:38.708 --> 40:40.667
Visiting hours end at 6:00.

40:40.667 --> 40:42.208
Please come back tomorrow.

40:42.208 --> 40:44.084
[Sutton]
I know. I'm sorry.

40:44.084 --> 40:45.291
I'm just looking for someone.

40:45.291 --> 40:47.875
Uh, I think she works here.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.208
Her name is Annie Hobbs.

40:52.167 --> 40:53.750
-Is she here?
-I'm sorry.

40:53.750 --> 40:56.166
-What did you say
your name was?
-I didn't.

40:56.166 --> 40:59.875
But I'm Sutton Mercer.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.542
I'm Dr. Hughes.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.667
Uh...

41:03.667 --> 41:05.792
Well, Sutton,
I'd really like to help,

41:05.792 --> 41:08.417
but unfortunately, we don't
have an employee by that name.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.166
Oh.

41:10.166 --> 41:12.167
Maybe she's a patient here?

41:12.792 --> 41:15.000
-I'm afraid not.
-Are you sure?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.250
Maybe I just have
the name wrong.

41:16.250 --> 41:19.208
Anybody with the name
of Hobbs, or-- Or Annie?

41:19.208 --> 41:21.167
Again, I'm sorry.

41:21.167 --> 41:22.667
I-- I'd really like to help.

41:23.166 --> 41:25.000
Okay.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.209
-Thanks for your time.
-Sure.

42:29.042 --> 42:30.667
Mom.

42:30.667 --> 42:32.000
[gasps and screams]

42:32.000 --> 42:34.917
No! No!
