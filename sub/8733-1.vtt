00:31.747 --> 00:33.339
No.

00:40.289 --> 00:42.621
No means no.

00:52.567 --> 00:53.932
<i>Bonjour.</i>

00:54.102 --> 00:55.535
<i>Carl, I know it's you.</i>

00:55.704 --> 00:57.399
Oh. Hey, man.

00:57.606 --> 01:00.074
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

01:00.242 --> 01:02.540
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send."

01:02.711 --> 01:03.905
Did you block your number?

01:04.078 --> 01:08.207
<i>Yeah, I did.
You never answer when I don't.</i>

01:08.650 --> 01:10.140
<i>So, what are you doing?</i>

01:10.319 --> 01:12.583
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

01:12.754 --> 01:15.222
- <i>You did get my text, right?</i>
- What? Text? What?

01:15.390 --> 01:16.823
<i>We're all going out tonight.</i>

01:16.992 --> 01:19.586
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

01:19.761 --> 01:20.785
I'm just so jammed up.

01:20.963 --> 01:22.828
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

01:22.998 --> 01:24.260
<i>No, I don't at all.</i>

01:24.433 --> 01:27.596
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

01:27.769 --> 01:30.499
Any other night would've been great.
Darn it to heck.

01:30.672 --> 01:31.900
<i>Thing? What thing?</i>

01:32.074 --> 01:33.564
Thing, you know, just a thing.

01:33.742 --> 01:36.677
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

01:36.845 --> 01:39.075
...but I know there's a thing.
- <i>A thing.</i>

01:39.247 --> 01:42.341
<i>I don't think there's anything</i>
<i>written down in your fake calendar.</i>

01:42.517 --> 01:44.109
No, it says specific things.

01:44.286 --> 01:47.380
<i>Specific things.</i>
<i>Like "get in line at the video store"?</i>

01:47.556 --> 01:49.683
What? What are you talking about?

01:49.858 --> 01:52.349
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

01:52.527 --> 01:55.963
<i>I can see you, Carl.</i>
<i>I'm outside the video store.</i>

01:58.133 --> 01:59.930
- That's not me.
- <i>It's not?</i>

02:00.102 --> 02:03.799
Oh, I know what's happening.
There is this guy who looks just like me...

02:03.972 --> 02:06.031
...who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

02:06.208 --> 02:07.800
That's probably who you're seeing.

02:07.976 --> 02:09.000
Wow, that's amazing...

02:09.176 --> 02:12.112
...because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

02:13.815 --> 02:15.806
<i>Carl, I know you're not saying anything.</i>

02:16.952 --> 02:19.250
Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.

02:19.421 --> 02:22.083
- What? All right.
- Carl.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.986
Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

02:29.131 --> 02:30.621
Hi.

02:30.799 --> 02:32.994
I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

02:33.168 --> 02:36.604
Carl Allen.
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

02:36.772 --> 02:39.570
Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

02:39.775 --> 02:41.675
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on...

02:41.843 --> 02:45.438
...some things I gotta do, issues pending,
keep me pretty busy.

02:45.614 --> 02:47.172
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

02:47.349 --> 02:49.817
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

02:49.985 --> 02:52.419
...because we have an announcement
to make.

02:52.587 --> 02:54.487
Honey, show him.

02:55.490 --> 02:57.219
There it is. Deal with it.

02:57.392 --> 02:58.689
We're engaged.

02:58.860 --> 03:01.260
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

03:01.430 --> 03:04.991
Big step, huh?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

03:05.167 --> 03:07.032
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

03:07.202 --> 03:08.567
What has it been, six months?

03:08.737 --> 03:10.568
- No.
- Two years.

03:10.739 --> 03:13.207
Oh, yeah. That's about right, then.

03:14.042 --> 03:17.978
So anyway, we're gonna have
an engagement party on the 21 st. Open bar.

03:18.146 --> 03:20.205
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

03:20.382 --> 03:22.407
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

03:22.851 --> 03:25.820
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

03:26.421 --> 03:27.581
Oh, God, look who's here.

03:27.756 --> 03:30.350
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

03:30.525 --> 03:33.585
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

03:33.762 --> 03:36.822
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.927
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

03:41.103 --> 03:44.903
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

03:47.075 --> 03:49.771
They're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

03:49.945 --> 03:53.039
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

03:53.215 --> 03:55.513
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

03:55.684 --> 03:57.879
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

03:58.053 --> 04:00.681
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

04:00.856 --> 04:02.881
Carl. Peter.

04:03.058 --> 04:04.423
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

04:04.593 --> 04:05.855
Hey.

04:06.027 --> 04:08.120
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

04:08.296 --> 04:11.288
- I don't believe we...
- No, I don't believe we have.

04:11.833 --> 04:14.063
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

04:14.236 --> 04:16.761
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

04:16.938 --> 04:18.529
You just got here, too, Carl.

04:19.673 --> 04:22.268
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

04:22.444 --> 04:25.470
Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing,
and there's no time.

04:25.647 --> 04:28.548
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

04:28.717 --> 04:32.380
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

04:34.456 --> 04:37.323
Wow. That didn't sound quite right.
Oh, well.

04:37.492 --> 04:39.050
Whoa!

04:47.969 --> 04:49.732
See you, guys.

05:08.723 --> 05:12.454
- Oh! Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

05:12.627 --> 05:14.959
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

05:15.130 --> 05:17.257
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

05:17.432 --> 05:20.333
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

05:20.502 --> 05:22.094
How about some toast, huh?

05:22.270 --> 05:25.535
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

05:25.707 --> 05:27.971
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

05:28.577 --> 05:30.568
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

05:30.745 --> 05:33.305
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

05:33.481 --> 05:36.814
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

05:37.652 --> 05:38.949
Yeah, bye.

05:39.988 --> 05:44.084
Persianwifefinder.com.
No, thank you.

05:44.626 --> 05:48.323
Costume party. Yeah, no.

05:50.265 --> 05:51.289
Oh, boy.

05:53.702 --> 05:55.363
Here we go.

05:55.537 --> 05:59.473
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

06:00.342 --> 06:02.742
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

06:03.645 --> 06:05.636
Norman. Line one.

06:06.715 --> 06:09.183
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

06:09.351 --> 06:12.411
- I'll just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

06:13.054 --> 06:14.544
You're with Norman.

06:14.923 --> 06:20.384
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

06:20.562 --> 06:21.893
Okay.

06:24.165 --> 06:26.258
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

06:26.434 --> 06:27.833
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

06:28.003 --> 06:30.096
Tried to fight for you on the phone there.

06:30.272 --> 06:32.797
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

06:32.974 --> 06:35.875
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

06:36.044 --> 06:39.445
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

06:39.614 --> 06:42.708
Look at it this way:
at least you didn't get shit-canned.

06:42.884 --> 06:45.682
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

06:46.187 --> 06:49.452
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

06:49.624 --> 06:51.524
No, it's a pretty common expression.

06:51.693 --> 06:56.426
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

06:56.598 --> 06:59.658
This'll cheer you up.
I'm having a little get-together at my place.

06:59.834 --> 07:03.770
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

07:04.873 --> 07:06.363
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

07:06.941 --> 07:08.932
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

07:09.110 --> 07:10.270
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

07:10.845 --> 07:12.813
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

07:12.981 --> 07:15.609
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

07:15.784 --> 07:18.844
...regardless of what I was gonna say.
- Hm.

07:20.121 --> 07:22.055
I admit, business has been slow.

07:22.223 --> 07:25.158
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

07:25.327 --> 07:27.386
...what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

07:27.595 --> 07:30.996
...but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

07:31.166 --> 07:35.068
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

07:35.236 --> 07:36.396
- None.
- And your credit...

07:36.571 --> 07:39.096
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

07:39.274 --> 07:42.300
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

07:53.254 --> 07:55.984
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

07:56.157 --> 07:58.990
Nick Lane? Hey.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.129
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

08:02.297 --> 08:06.427
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the nametag.

08:06.601 --> 08:08.626
You must be running this place by now.

08:08.803 --> 08:12.295
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

08:12.474 --> 08:13.873
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

08:14.042 --> 08:15.703
God.

08:16.311 --> 08:18.836
She's good. What have you been doing?

08:19.013 --> 08:22.176
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

08:22.350 --> 08:25.877
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

08:26.054 --> 08:27.612
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

08:27.789 --> 08:30.781
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

08:30.959 --> 08:34.190
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

08:35.196 --> 08:36.322
I'm a yes man.

08:37.131 --> 08:39.464
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

08:39.634 --> 08:41.363
No, thanks. I'm fine.

08:41.535 --> 08:43.299
"Fine?" I wipe my ass with "fine."

08:43.471 --> 08:45.132
Wow. Okay.

08:45.306 --> 08:49.800
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

08:50.111 --> 08:51.806
No, you don't.

08:53.181 --> 08:54.671
Why don't you take this rock...

08:54.849 --> 08:57.977
...throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

08:58.153 --> 09:01.145
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

09:01.322 --> 09:03.916
- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.057
Oh, my God.

09:07.228 --> 09:09.423
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

09:09.898 --> 09:10.922
Stay right there.

09:11.099 --> 09:12.930
He's gonna break.
- Stop.

09:17.305 --> 09:21.435
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

09:21.609 --> 09:24.476
Whoo!
- Hey, stop. Stop!

09:34.489 --> 09:36.787
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

09:37.392 --> 09:38.416
Sorry.

09:40.361 --> 09:42.090
<i>Hello?</i>
- Stephanie?

09:42.263 --> 09:44.595
- Carl.
- <i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

09:44.766 --> 09:48.896
Just felt like calling you.
I was missing you, I guess. Weird, huh?

09:49.337 --> 09:50.827
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

09:51.005 --> 09:54.202
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.400
Good for you. Good for you.

10:07.856 --> 10:11.314
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

10:17.765 --> 10:21.428
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

10:29.177 --> 10:33.113
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

10:33.281 --> 10:37.650
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

10:37.819 --> 10:39.184
You're so full of shit.

10:40.588 --> 10:43.989
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

10:44.158 --> 10:46.956
You know what, buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

10:47.328 --> 10:50.695
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

10:50.865 --> 10:54.096
- Mm-hm.
- I'm so sorry, man. I totally gapped it.

10:54.269 --> 10:56.829
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

10:57.005 --> 10:59.872
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'll go out, swashbuckle.

11:00.041 --> 11:02.407
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

11:02.577 --> 11:06.604
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

11:06.781 --> 11:09.773
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

11:09.951 --> 11:12.351
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

11:12.520 --> 11:16.684
And I know that you have issues because
of it, but this isn't about you. It's about me.

11:17.325 --> 11:20.385
When's the last time you did anything fun?
You always make excuses.

11:20.562 --> 11:22.996
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down."

11:23.164 --> 11:25.359
I mean, do you even know
my fiancée's last name?

11:25.533 --> 11:28.502
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

11:28.670 --> 11:32.902
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

11:33.074 --> 11:36.305
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

11:36.477 --> 11:37.967
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

11:38.313 --> 11:40.508
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

11:40.682 --> 11:43.378
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

11:43.918 --> 11:47.046
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

11:47.221 --> 11:49.086
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, I...

11:49.257 --> 11:52.351
I don't wanna hear another excuse, Carl.
You do whatever you want.

11:52.527 --> 11:55.860
I'm telling you, you don't change your life,
you're gonna end up lonely.

11:56.030 --> 12:01.400
A lonely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.935
Hey, Carl.

12:11.746 --> 12:13.714
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

12:16.651 --> 12:21.054
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

12:22.590 --> 12:24.785
Nope. No more than usual.

12:24.959 --> 12:28.759
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

12:31.032 --> 12:34.468
I guess I never saw him a lot,
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

12:34.669 --> 12:36.398
Yeah, that's true.

12:37.071 --> 12:38.732
He never did much.

12:38.906 --> 12:40.237
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

12:40.975 --> 12:42.875
Wasn't a good anything.

12:43.044 --> 12:47.037
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

12:47.715 --> 12:49.046
Now, that's upsetting.

12:54.922 --> 12:56.856
What was that?

13:39.000 --> 13:43.835
<i>Welcome to yes.
We are about to begin.</i>

13:44.105 --> 13:46.699
<i>Please, find a seat.</i>

13:47.175 --> 13:50.201
Carl? Hey, Carl! Psst!

13:50.378 --> 13:51.902
Carl, man, hey.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.173
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

13:54.682 --> 13:56.547
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...

13:56.718 --> 13:58.879
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

13:59.053 --> 14:02.887
I saw it in your eyes, man.
You're gonna love this. Terrence is a genius.

14:03.057 --> 14:07.084
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

14:07.261 --> 14:09.729
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

14:09.897 --> 14:11.091
That's why you're here.

14:11.265 --> 14:15.133
You have got to start saying yes, my man,
and I mean to everything.

14:15.937 --> 14:17.131
It's starting.

14:18.139 --> 14:19.663
<i>Life.</i>

14:20.007 --> 14:23.568
<i>We are all living it. Or are we?</i>

14:23.745 --> 14:25.110
Ooh, heavy.

14:25.279 --> 14:31.684
<i>Change is generated from consciousness,</i>
<i>but where is consciousness generated from?</i>

14:31.853 --> 14:33.980
<i>From the external.</i>

14:34.155 --> 14:38.216
<i>And how do we control the external?</i>
<i>With one word.</i>

14:38.993 --> 14:40.324
<i>And what is that word?</i>

14:40.795 --> 14:42.888
Yes!
- Jeez.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.059
Yes.

14:47.702 --> 14:48.726
Yes.

14:50.571 --> 14:53.438
Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

14:58.880 --> 15:01.041
MAN 3: Yes!
NICK:- Whoo!

15:01.716 --> 15:03.547
The word is "yes."

15:04.252 --> 15:07.585
Yes, yes, yes.

15:07.822 --> 15:10.017
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

15:10.224 --> 15:11.885
Say it a million more times.

15:12.059 --> 15:15.358
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

15:15.530 --> 15:17.657
Yes!

15:24.639 --> 15:25.697
Yes.

15:25.973 --> 15:30.876
I want you to invite yes into your lives...

15:31.045 --> 15:35.880
...because it will RSVP "yes."

15:36.918 --> 15:41.946
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

15:42.123 --> 15:48.551
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

15:49.597 --> 15:55.502
Before we begin today,
I'd like to welcome our new members.

15:57.905 --> 16:02.842
- Who among you is new?
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.

16:03.010 --> 16:05.137
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

16:05.313 --> 16:11.582
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

16:14.555 --> 16:19.151
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

16:19.760 --> 16:24.959
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

16:26.500 --> 16:30.800
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

16:32.139 --> 16:33.367
Thank you.

16:33.541 --> 16:36.601
Back up just a little bit more.

16:36.777 --> 16:39.541
- No.
<i>- No man. No man.</i>

16:39.714 --> 16:41.773
<i>No man. No man. No man.</i>

16:41.949 --> 16:43.143
<i>No man. No man.</i>

16:43.317 --> 16:44.716
Okay.

16:46.454 --> 16:49.389
If the molehill won't come to Terrence...

16:50.324 --> 16:53.782
...Terrence will come to the molehill.

17:01.936 --> 17:02.994
What's your name?

17:04.805 --> 17:06.238
Carl.

17:06.674 --> 17:08.039
Let me guess, Carl.

17:08.209 --> 17:10.871
Someone talked you
into coming here today, didn't they?

17:11.979 --> 17:14.470
- Yes.
- Yes!

17:14.648 --> 17:18.380
And you're not sure about this, are you?

17:18.986 --> 17:20.010
No.

17:20.186 --> 17:24.248
<i>No man. No man.
No man. No man.</i>

17:24.425 --> 17:26.051
You're dead, Carl.

17:26.827 --> 17:30.160
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

17:30.598 --> 17:33.328
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

17:33.501 --> 17:34.866
...and to yourself.

17:35.369 --> 17:38.930
You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
You have been for years.

17:39.106 --> 17:43.338
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

17:43.511 --> 17:45.376
And you lost the love of your life...

17:45.546 --> 17:48.538
...because she couldn't be with someone
who didn't live theirs.

17:52.086 --> 17:56.352
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

17:56.524 --> 18:00.688
...you can't even summon the enthusiasm
necessary to masturbate.

18:01.729 --> 18:03.822
Am I right, Carl?

18:08.135 --> 18:11.696
I have had some trouble.

18:18.245 --> 18:21.737
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

18:21.916 --> 18:25.374
- Do you want to make a covenant?
- Ugh...

18:26.821 --> 18:28.345
The word is "yes," Carl.

18:28.522 --> 18:29.750
Yes!
- Yes.

18:29.924 --> 18:30.948
Yes!
- Yes.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.615
Yes!

18:33.060 --> 18:35.654
Once you leave this building...

18:36.330 --> 18:39.822
...every time an opportunity
presents itself...

18:40.568 --> 18:42.798
...no matter what it is...

18:42.970 --> 18:45.029
...you will say yes.

18:45.206 --> 18:46.298
Yes.
- Yes!

18:46.474 --> 18:47.771
Yes.
- Yes!

18:47.942 --> 18:50.035
Yes.
- Yes.

18:51.479 --> 18:53.242
What if I...

18:54.482 --> 18:56.143
...say...

18:56.584 --> 18:58.108
...the other word?

18:58.919 --> 19:01.854
You'll be making a promise to yourself.

19:02.023 --> 19:06.050
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

19:06.227 --> 19:09.526
...things can get a little dicey.

19:09.697 --> 19:12.257
What do you say, Carl?

19:12.666 --> 19:15.897
Are you ready to make a covenant?

19:16.170 --> 19:17.831
Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

19:18.005 --> 19:19.302
Yes.
- Yes.

19:19.473 --> 19:21.600
Yes.
- Again.

19:21.776 --> 19:23.209
- Yes.
- Yes.

19:23.377 --> 19:25.208
- Say it again.
- Yes!

19:27.148 --> 19:30.982
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

19:34.789 --> 19:35.847
Yes!

20:04.552 --> 20:05.576
Hey, there he is.

20:05.753 --> 20:07.516
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

20:07.688 --> 20:09.053
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

20:09.223 --> 20:11.521
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

20:11.692 --> 20:15.150
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

20:15.329 --> 20:19.527
That's weird. I didn't realize
we just stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

20:21.702 --> 20:24.899
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

20:25.706 --> 20:28.436
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

20:29.376 --> 20:31.173
Oh. Ugh...

20:31.345 --> 20:32.710
Yes!

20:33.581 --> 20:37.142
Sure he can. Right, Carl?

20:40.287 --> 20:41.720
Yeah, why not?

20:42.623 --> 20:46.252
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

20:51.699 --> 20:56.295
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

21:25.166 --> 21:28.795
Keep going or this'll do,
because it doesn't really matter?

21:28.969 --> 21:31.164
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

21:31.338 --> 21:34.933
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

21:35.109 --> 21:36.838
Go ahead.

21:38.179 --> 21:39.669
And what did you say?

21:41.115 --> 21:46.246
Oh, I'm just right over here.
Okay. Yeah.

21:46.854 --> 21:48.082
What? Hello? Hello?

21:49.490 --> 21:51.958
Oh, shit, man. Your battery's dead.

21:52.126 --> 21:53.787
Oh, great.

21:55.029 --> 21:58.988
- Thanks.
- Well, <i>gracias, amigo.</i>

21:59.166 --> 22:02.624
I mean, it's real nice of you
to give me a ride. Most people just say no.

22:03.170 --> 22:06.469
Course, I have been having a lot of luck
lately outside of that hotel.

22:06.941 --> 22:09.307
No problem. Have a good night.

22:10.177 --> 22:12.111
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

22:14.481 --> 22:15.505
Okay.

22:16.684 --> 22:18.709
I've come this far.

22:20.654 --> 22:22.315
Yes, you can.

22:22.489 --> 22:25.219
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

22:30.965 --> 22:34.366
Sure. It's all yours.

22:37.338 --> 22:39.738
God bless you, man.

23:01.128 --> 23:02.595
Oh, come on.

23:03.697 --> 23:05.562
Come on, come on.

23:10.004 --> 23:11.232
Perfect.

23:12.406 --> 23:15.773
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give all
your money away to a homeless guy?

23:15.943 --> 23:17.433
Yes, yes, I do.

23:17.611 --> 23:19.135
Letting him
burn out your phone...

23:19.313 --> 23:21.577
...so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

23:21.749 --> 23:24.240
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

23:24.985 --> 23:27.249
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

23:27.421 --> 23:30.788
...and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

23:48.108 --> 23:49.939
Come on, man.

23:52.446 --> 23:55.904
Yes. Since that's my only fucking option.

24:11.899 --> 24:15.892
Would you like to carry a 20-pound
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?

24:16.070 --> 24:19.164
Oh, could I? Could I really?

24:20.574 --> 24:22.064
That's a good look.

24:23.977 --> 24:27.504
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

24:28.649 --> 24:30.810
Did you just run out of gas?

24:31.285 --> 24:32.582
Maybe.

24:34.288 --> 24:38.247
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

24:38.425 --> 24:40.256
When you were driving
out of your way...

24:40.427 --> 24:44.193
...to drop off a homeless guy who wore out
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?

24:44.365 --> 24:47.163
No. I take it
that's what happened to you.

24:47.334 --> 24:49.734
No. Why would you assume that?

24:51.638 --> 24:52.935
He used up your phone?

24:53.107 --> 24:57.043
Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

24:57.211 --> 24:59.805
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

24:59.980 --> 25:02.972
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

25:03.150 --> 25:05.778
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

25:05.953 --> 25:08.444
Yeah. And I'm getting some exercise,
which is cool.

25:09.123 --> 25:10.818
Well, do you need a ride?

25:11.892 --> 25:13.450
On that thing?

25:24.171 --> 25:26.332
Am I going too fast for you?

25:26.507 --> 25:29.374
No. In fact, I think you should go faster.

25:29.543 --> 25:32.307
That way if we crash, at least I'll die.

25:32.479 --> 25:35.209
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

25:44.591 --> 25:49.392
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

25:50.697 --> 25:55.327
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!

26:07.748 --> 26:11.809
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

26:13.954 --> 26:16.286
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

26:16.457 --> 26:19.688
Hopefully the color will return
to your face sometime soon.

26:19.860 --> 26:22.852
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

26:23.030 --> 26:26.522
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

26:28.469 --> 26:32.269
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

26:32.439 --> 26:33.599
Yeah.

26:35.108 --> 26:36.939
Thanks.

26:38.078 --> 26:39.238
So you okay?

26:39.413 --> 26:42.610
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

26:42.783 --> 26:45.308
- What?
- What did you say?

26:48.989 --> 26:50.547
Hey, I...

26:55.863 --> 26:57.888
Have a good night.

27:23.190 --> 27:25.090
Yes.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.968
"Yes always leads to something good.

27:40.007 --> 27:42.202
Never avoid opportunities.

27:42.376 --> 27:44.469
They may come in any form."

27:48.982 --> 27:52.213
- Hello?
- <i>Carl, it's your buddy Norman.</i>

27:52.386 --> 27:55.321
Well, and your boss, but more your buddy
than your boss, right?

27:55.489 --> 27:57.218
I guess.

27:58.492 --> 28:01.359
So look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

28:01.528 --> 28:03.189
Is there any way you could come in?

28:04.197 --> 28:05.425
Sure.

28:05.599 --> 28:09.057
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

28:09.236 --> 28:13.468
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

28:17.611 --> 28:21.570
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

28:22.716 --> 28:23.808
Right.

28:24.384 --> 28:26.045
Like I need that.

28:30.424 --> 28:35.293
- Persian wifefinder.
<i>- Hi there. I am Faranoush.</i>

28:35.462 --> 28:37.953
<i>Would you be the man for me?</i>

28:38.398 --> 28:40.161
I guess so.

28:41.234 --> 28:44.533
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

28:44.705 --> 28:46.002
And what's your business?

28:46.173 --> 28:49.404
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

28:49.810 --> 28:53.769
- Oh, wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No. It's Bono.

28:54.314 --> 28:56.839
Oh. Yeah, right.

28:57.017 --> 28:59.383
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

29:00.754 --> 29:02.085
So, what do you think?

29:05.425 --> 29:06.983
I think yes.

29:12.232 --> 29:13.790
Inta-maresting.

29:14.301 --> 29:15.734
Cakes, huh?

29:15.902 --> 29:19.998
Yeah. I just kind of went with my gut
on it, Norm.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.838
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

29:23.010 --> 29:26.537
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

29:26.713 --> 29:31.548
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

29:31.752 --> 29:33.617
Yeah. Carl's pretty short already, but...

29:33.787 --> 29:35.982
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

29:36.156 --> 29:38.021
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

29:38.191 --> 29:39.215
What?

29:39.393 --> 29:43.955
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

29:44.131 --> 29:47.726
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko,
or along with Demko...

29:47.901 --> 29:50.335
...whichever, or I walk."

29:50.504 --> 29:52.768
Really? What did they say?

29:52.939 --> 29:56.670
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

29:56.843 --> 29:59.175
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

29:59.346 --> 30:02.804
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

30:03.583 --> 30:04.607
And?

30:04.818 --> 30:06.149
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

30:06.319 --> 30:08.082
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

30:08.255 --> 30:09.984
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

30:10.157 --> 30:12.022
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

30:12.192 --> 30:14.490
...to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

30:14.661 --> 30:16.856
- No.
- How did you know that?

30:17.030 --> 30:18.054
He's not here.

30:18.231 --> 30:20.597
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

30:20.767 --> 30:23.759
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

30:24.137 --> 30:27.436
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

30:27.607 --> 30:31.634
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

30:31.812 --> 30:34.645
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

30:34.815 --> 30:37.682
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

30:39.586 --> 30:40.610
See what I did there?

30:40.787 --> 30:46.089
I joined "bro" with "Joseph." Broseph.
Pretty cool, huh?

30:46.593 --> 30:48.083
Very cool, Norm.

30:52.165 --> 30:55.157
I have been such a dick and a douche.

30:55.602 --> 30:57.968
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

30:58.138 --> 31:00.936
...but I'm sorry. I should have been there.
I mean, really.

31:01.208 --> 31:05.770
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl.
- I'm telling you, man, things are different.

31:05.946 --> 31:08.471
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

31:08.648 --> 31:12.414
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said:
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

31:12.586 --> 31:16.613
...and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

31:16.790 --> 31:19.759
All right. Look, gets you out of the house,
I'm all for it.

31:19.926 --> 31:22.190
Excuse me.
Could we get another round of drinks?

31:22.362 --> 31:24.227
And actually, we're gonna start a tab...

31:24.397 --> 31:27.366
...and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

31:29.069 --> 31:33.665
- Well, you're okay with that, right, buddy?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.205
Okay.

31:39.246 --> 31:43.546
I should be prepping my case for Monday,
but I cannot miss this.

31:43.717 --> 31:46.914
Hey, you, another bump of hot sauce.

31:48.388 --> 31:52.415
Boy, you guys are really into this yes thing.

31:56.963 --> 31:58.362
Argh!

32:01.101 --> 32:02.534
Okay, okay.

32:22.789 --> 32:23.949
He did it.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.265
Drinks on me.

32:36.136 --> 32:37.330
Crazy, man.

32:38.738 --> 32:40.103
Carl, that was so awesome.

32:40.273 --> 32:42.741
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could I...

32:42.909 --> 32:44.740
Absolutely.

32:44.911 --> 32:49.109
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

32:52.085 --> 32:54.053
Was I chewing gum before?

32:54.221 --> 32:56.746
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

32:56.923 --> 32:59.585
Easy, easy.
It was a little misunderstanding, okay?

32:59.759 --> 33:04.958
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

33:05.131 --> 33:08.294
I made a sacred "conevant."

33:08.802 --> 33:10.429
That sounded naughty.

33:11.071 --> 33:13.869
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.373
Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.

33:17.777 --> 33:20.371
Okay. But if I win...

33:20.547 --> 33:24.415
...I get to take that pretty girl of yours
to a ball...

33:24.584 --> 33:26.916
...because she deserves that.

33:27.087 --> 33:30.545
Every pretty girl deserves to go to a ball.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.282
That is so nice.

33:37.130 --> 33:38.188
Oh, shit.

33:41.268 --> 33:44.931
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

33:45.105 --> 33:47.733
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

33:47.908 --> 33:49.603
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

33:49.776 --> 33:52.506
- I haven't fighted in a fight since grade 7.
- I know.

33:52.679 --> 33:54.613
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

33:54.781 --> 33:58.342
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

33:58.518 --> 34:00.782
You want some, huh, more?

34:00.954 --> 34:04.321
Because I am open for business, okay?
Oh, where'd I go?

34:04.958 --> 34:06.550
Oh, where'd I go?

34:06.726 --> 34:08.819
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

34:10.096 --> 34:13.429
Did you see <i>The Legend of Billy Jack?</i>

34:13.833 --> 34:16.233
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

34:16.402 --> 34:20.168
...and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

34:20.340 --> 34:22.934
...and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

34:24.844 --> 34:27.244
Just don't
break my teeth off on the curb, okay?

34:27.414 --> 34:31.282
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

34:31.451 --> 34:32.475
What?

34:32.652 --> 34:37.453
First, we have
to establish the ground rules.

34:37.623 --> 34:40.991
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

34:45.398 --> 34:48.264
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

34:48.568 --> 34:51.196
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

34:51.371 --> 34:52.895
That's why you got punched out...

34:53.072 --> 34:56.634
...because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

34:56.810 --> 34:58.209
I'm over here, dickhole.

34:58.745 --> 35:02.340
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

35:02.649 --> 35:04.640
You're a complete...

35:05.919 --> 35:06.943
You all right?

35:07.120 --> 35:09.213
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

35:09.389 --> 35:11.118
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

35:11.291 --> 35:13.282
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

35:13.460 --> 35:15.325
I'm glad we had this experience.

35:15.662 --> 35:20.895
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

35:22.435 --> 35:27.737
We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

35:30.944 --> 35:33.378
She's never gonna go to a ball.

35:33.546 --> 35:36.344
No. No, she's not.

36:08.014 --> 36:12.075
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

36:12.252 --> 36:13.651
What can I do for you?

36:13.820 --> 36:17.153
Well, I was wondering if you could help me
put up some shelves.

36:18.158 --> 36:19.750
Oh, really?

36:25.999 --> 36:32.097
Okay. That should just about do it.

36:32.272 --> 36:35.673
- I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

36:36.609 --> 36:39.407
Oh, not so fast.

36:40.013 --> 36:41.412
What are you doing?

36:42.282 --> 36:46.218
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

36:46.386 --> 36:48.946
I'm getting so forgetful.

36:49.122 --> 36:52.182
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

36:52.358 --> 36:55.156
I am gonna have to repay you somehow.

36:55.328 --> 36:59.424
Oh, just doing a favor for a neighbor
is good enough for me.

37:00.667 --> 37:03.158
You are so handsome.

37:04.170 --> 37:07.867
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

37:08.041 --> 37:13.707
Well, I'm just... I'm not in a serious thing,
but I am dating.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.542
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

37:16.716 --> 37:19.549
You know, a sexual release?

37:19.752 --> 37:21.083
Uh...

37:22.021 --> 37:26.321
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

37:26.493 --> 37:30.156
You just lay back
and I will take care of everything.

37:30.330 --> 37:33.697
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

37:33.867 --> 37:36.927
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

37:37.103 --> 37:40.368
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

37:40.540 --> 37:45.500
And I've got this thing I gotta do,
so I'll be seeing you.

37:46.746 --> 37:49.806
In my nightmares.

37:51.184 --> 37:53.448
Oh, come on, give me a break.

37:54.454 --> 37:57.651
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.
That's ridiculous.

37:57.824 --> 38:02.557
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

38:16.643 --> 38:17.667
Nice dog.

38:29.355 --> 38:33.724
Just relax. I'll handle this.

38:39.432 --> 38:40.990
Oh, God!

38:42.101 --> 38:45.764
Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...

38:46.573 --> 38:47.665
Wow.

38:47.974 --> 38:50.204
That... Oh...

38:51.744 --> 38:53.211
That is a...

38:53.379 --> 38:55.176
How are you doing that? Ay!

39:01.888 --> 39:05.415
"Costume party. Come as your favorite
<i>Harry Potter</i> character."

39:05.592 --> 39:06.616
You got it, Norm.

39:54.641 --> 39:55.665
Hi.

39:57.844 --> 40:01.336
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

40:01.514 --> 40:04.381
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a.m. and 5:30?

40:05.752 --> 40:07.686
Hello. Wondering if you had a moment...

40:07.854 --> 40:10.721
...to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

40:11.891 --> 40:15.088
- Buttercup Girls.
- Buttercup Girls.

40:16.763 --> 40:18.594
Yeah. All right.

40:21.534 --> 40:25.231
Hey. It's really working. Ah!

40:29.776 --> 40:33.212
It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful.

40:33.379 --> 40:36.940
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

40:37.116 --> 40:38.777
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

40:38.951 --> 40:45.948
<i>I would understand</i>

40:48.127 --> 40:49.617
All right, now I got it.

40:53.599 --> 40:54.861
Whoa.

41:08.448 --> 41:10.609
What did he call me?

41:16.222 --> 41:17.246
Homeless.

41:18.458 --> 41:20.255
Come and get it.

41:20.460 --> 41:22.428
There you are. You want some?

41:22.628 --> 41:23.959
He never listens.

41:25.298 --> 41:26.322
Yeah.

41:27.100 --> 41:30.433
I wanna start an
organic-fertilizer distribution business.

41:34.574 --> 41:35.632
Next.

41:36.409 --> 41:40.277
- Wanna see a... Oh, sorry.
- You know what? I'd love to.

41:40.446 --> 41:42.141
Way to stick in there.

42:01.467 --> 42:02.798
There you go.

42:03.035 --> 42:05.401
Hey. I came.

42:05.972 --> 42:07.667
Great.

42:09.041 --> 42:10.303
Yeah.

42:12.111 --> 42:13.806
Rolling Rock, please.

42:16.716 --> 42:19.549
From the dawn of time...
- In the netherworld.

42:21.354 --> 42:23.015
There was a band.

42:23.189 --> 42:25.214
Oh, yes, there was.

42:25.858 --> 42:27.257
And we were that band.

42:27.427 --> 42:29.224
Yes, we were.

42:29.429 --> 42:31.158
And that band made rock 'n' roll.

42:31.330 --> 42:32.888
Oh, yes, they did.

42:33.699 --> 42:38.159
And that band ate arame
and other sea vegetables.

42:38.337 --> 42:39.770
Yeah.

42:39.939 --> 42:42.999
And that band was rad.

42:46.045 --> 42:51.039
Hello, Jake, Penelope,
Rodrigo, Phillip, Zachary.

42:51.250 --> 42:54.117
- We are Munchausen by Proxy.
- You're kidding me.

42:54.287 --> 42:56.414
<i>I should have been the one</i>
<i>To break up with you</i>

42:56.589 --> 42:58.523
<i>You said, "Who are you?"</i>

42:58.691 --> 43:00.522
<i>Who are you?</i>

43:00.693 --> 43:06.097
<i>I wanna snap your neck and spit on you</i>
<i>You said, "Who are you?"</i>

43:06.265 --> 43:08.130
<i>Who are you?</i>

43:08.501 --> 43:13.564
<i>If I got a call that said you were dead</i>
<i>You said, "Who are you?"</i>

43:13.739 --> 43:15.764
<i>Who are you?</i>

43:15.942 --> 43:20.709
<i>I'd shrug my shoulders, and I'd say whatevs</i>
<i>You said, "Who are you?"</i>

43:20.880 --> 43:23.371
<i>Who are you?</i>

43:23.549 --> 43:27.986
Hey, did you ever meet my friend Ian?
He's a computer hacker.

43:28.154 --> 43:31.612
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

43:31.791 --> 43:36.160
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

43:36.329 --> 43:38.229
Happy networking, asshole.

43:54.514 --> 43:59.076
<i>Don't call me past 11 p.m.</i>
<i>It won't happen again</i>

43:59.252 --> 44:01.117
<i>Happened once, it happened twice</i>

44:01.287 --> 44:04.950
<i>It happened three times,</i>
<i>Maybe four times, maybe five times, maybe</i>

44:05.124 --> 44:08.059

<i>But it won't happen a seventh time</i>

44:19.639 --> 44:22.130

44:22.308 --> 44:27.211
<i>Don't call me past 11 p.m.</i>
<i>It won't happen again</i>

44:27.813 --> 44:29.542
<i>You can call me at 10:59</i>

44:29.715 --> 44:34.243
<i>But don't call me at 11</i>
<i>'Cause that's my rule now</i>

44:44.630 --> 44:47.121
Can I get a water?

44:51.804 --> 44:54.967
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

44:55.141 --> 44:58.542
Did we make out? Oh, right, we did.
Now I remember.

44:58.711 --> 45:01.475
- What are you doing here?
- I know. Is this crazy or what?

45:01.647 --> 45:03.615
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah.

45:03.783 --> 45:06.343
- Are you stalking me?
- No. I would never do that.

45:06.519 --> 45:09.488
By the way, your new living-room
furniture looks great from the yard.

45:10.856 --> 45:15.520
- Hey, great gig or whatever, you know.
- Thanks.

45:15.695 --> 45:19.062
Yeah. Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

45:19.231 --> 45:22.064
- It comes from personal experience.
- Cool.

45:22.234 --> 45:23.531
You want a drink?

45:23.736 --> 45:26.899
Oh, I can't. I have to wake up early.

45:27.073 --> 45:30.236
- So I have to go, but...
- Oh, really?

45:32.511 --> 45:35.071
But you can walk me to my scooter.

45:36.482 --> 45:38.882
I teach a jogging photo group...

45:39.051 --> 45:43.454
...for people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.

45:43.623 --> 45:46.023
Oh, yeah,
that's getting very popular now.

45:46.192 --> 45:50.185
It's in Griffith Park and we do a loop.
It's about five miles.

45:50.363 --> 45:52.661
It's at 6 a.m.

45:52.832 --> 45:57.098
Wow. I haven't been up at 6 a.m.
in, like, never.

45:57.269 --> 46:01.399
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

46:02.775 --> 46:04.208
Okay, so you're in a band...

46:04.377 --> 46:07.471
...you do the jogging photography,
what else?

46:07.680 --> 46:09.773
Whatever I want.

46:09.949 --> 46:13.316
I volunteer at a shelter. I paint a little bit.

46:13.486 --> 46:15.920
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

46:16.088 --> 46:18.352
And some nude modeling, FYI.

46:19.659 --> 46:22.719
Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...

46:24.664 --> 46:28.498
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

46:28.668 --> 46:30.761
I didn't ask you out.

46:30.936 --> 46:33.131
Could have fooled me
with that modeling comment.

46:33.305 --> 46:34.704
You said that.

46:34.874 --> 46:37.502
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

46:39.879 --> 46:42.404
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

46:42.581 --> 46:46.642
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

46:46.819 --> 46:48.013
Yeah, I'd love to.

46:49.588 --> 46:53.490
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow...

46:53.659 --> 46:56.924
- Carl.
- Allison.

47:13.746 --> 47:14.770
Yeah, Rooney?

47:14.947 --> 47:16.676
<i>Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.</i>

47:16.849 --> 47:20.410
<i>Got a case of Red Bull.</i>
<i>Gonna pull an all-nighter. You down?</i>

47:20.586 --> 47:22.144
Yeah.

47:29.729 --> 47:32.163
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

47:32.331 --> 47:33.593
- Allison?
- Yeah?

47:33.766 --> 47:35.631
Do we need to use a flash?

47:35.801 --> 47:37.632
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

47:46.078 --> 47:49.309
Beautiful night, guys.
You take it to the limit, and I respect that.

47:49.482 --> 47:52.280
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

47:52.451 --> 47:56.512
Carl, if somebody asked me to
describe tonight, I would just go, "Ow!"

47:56.689 --> 47:59.749
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly know you,
but I feel comfortable.

47:59.925 --> 48:03.861
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

48:04.630 --> 48:06.655
Allison, I'm here.

48:08.334 --> 48:09.494
Allison.

48:10.870 --> 48:13.862
Hey. Who were those guys?

48:14.039 --> 48:17.338
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a nurse. I was making fun of him.

48:17.510 --> 48:20.411
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

48:20.579 --> 48:22.877
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

48:23.048 --> 48:26.779
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

48:26.952 --> 48:28.817
I got a new necklace. Glows in the dark.

48:28.988 --> 48:31.354
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

48:31.524 --> 48:34.960
That's really something. Doesn't Red Bull
make you crash pretty hard?

48:35.127 --> 48:37.857
No, no, no. No, no. I don't think so. No.

48:38.030 --> 48:41.022
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.600
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

48:43.769 --> 48:45.361
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

48:45.538 --> 48:46.664
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

48:46.872 --> 48:48.066
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.538
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

48:50.709 --> 48:52.802
Red Bull.

48:53.379 --> 48:58.043
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

48:58.217 --> 49:00.617
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

49:01.420 --> 49:04.981
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

49:11.964 --> 49:13.556
Oh, it's a good one.

49:15.668 --> 49:16.657
Hold that.

49:18.003 --> 49:19.129
Got it.

49:29.248 --> 49:31.307
Hey, Carl, you okay?

49:34.053 --> 49:36.044
Hold it right there.

49:51.370 --> 49:52.860
That's good.

49:54.106 --> 49:59.100
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

49:59.478 --> 50:01.412
Kind of mysterious.

50:01.580 --> 50:02.706
You know, listen.

50:02.882 --> 50:06.318
I like to keep it fresh. I like to live it up.
I like to mix it up.

50:06.485 --> 50:08.817
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this.

50:08.988 --> 50:10.853
I love that.

50:11.023 --> 50:14.220
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine.

50:14.393 --> 50:16.452
- Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

50:16.629 --> 50:20.065
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

50:20.232 --> 50:22.894
...just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

50:23.068 --> 50:26.731
I know. It's so frustrating. I just
wanna grab these people and shake them.

50:26.906 --> 50:30.637
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing out
on a little thing called life."

50:30.809 --> 50:32.538
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

50:33.412 --> 50:36.472
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

50:36.649 --> 50:39.914
It just didn't work out. It's a long story.

50:40.085 --> 50:43.486
Yeah? Same story
you were singing about last night?

50:44.323 --> 50:45.915
Might be.

50:46.825 --> 50:49.794
Closed-off-little-box boy, tender topic.
Probe no further.

50:49.962 --> 50:53.227
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

50:53.399 --> 50:56.391
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

50:56.568 --> 51:00.197
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

51:00.372 --> 51:01.737
Gone, never saw him again.

51:02.608 --> 51:06.305
Wow. That's rough. I'm sorry.

51:06.779 --> 51:09.839
Next time you should warn me
about the length of the story, though.

51:10.015 --> 51:11.107
Kind of dragged on.

51:11.283 --> 51:13.615
- I'll work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

51:14.019 --> 51:18.319
Ooh! Jeez. That was very healthy.

51:29.568 --> 51:32.036
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

51:32.204 --> 51:34.672
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.330
She's the complete opposite of me.

51:36.508 --> 51:38.806
Carl, could you please pass the Cholula?

51:38.978 --> 51:40.946
Sure, Faranoush.

51:41.880 --> 51:43.313
How did you two meet again?

51:43.482 --> 51:47.145
Persianwifefinder.com. It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

51:47.319 --> 51:49.719
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

51:49.888 --> 51:52.288
Should you talk about Allison
in front of Faranoush?

51:52.458 --> 51:55.325
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

51:55.494 --> 51:59.328
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

51:59.498 --> 52:00.897
Sorry, Faranoush.

52:01.500 --> 52:05.300
Anyway, I never would've met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

52:05.471 --> 52:07.632
You wouldn't be on a date
with a strange woman.

52:07.806 --> 52:10.206
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

52:10.376 --> 52:13.470
I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

52:13.645 --> 52:17.172
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

52:20.252 --> 52:22.550
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

52:24.423 --> 52:28.655
- Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy. Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

52:30.763 --> 52:32.560
So my friends are being really lame...

52:32.731 --> 52:35.894
...and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

52:36.068 --> 52:38.434
Hey, I have an idea.

52:38.771 --> 52:41.672
Carl, would you like to throw Lucy
a bridal shower?

52:42.041 --> 52:44.942
Yeah. Sure.

52:45.110 --> 52:47.340
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

52:47.513 --> 52:49.071
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

52:54.887 --> 52:56.980
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:57.156 --> 53:00.182
Well, thanks, Carl.

53:00.559 --> 53:04.620
Thanks, that's really sweet.

53:05.064 --> 53:06.929
That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

53:07.099 --> 53:09.090
Thanks, Faranoush.

53:09.368 --> 53:12.132
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up costumes
for me and Allison.

53:12.304 --> 53:13.566
Costumes for what?

53:15.074 --> 53:17.668
<i>Expelliarmus!</i> Just kidding.

53:17.843 --> 53:19.936
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

53:20.112 --> 53:23.912
Oh. Kaching!
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

53:24.083 --> 53:26.643
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

53:26.819 --> 53:30.084
This is Allison
and her wand made from a sequoia.

53:31.123 --> 53:32.351
- Hi.
- You must be Norman.

53:32.524 --> 53:36.688
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

53:38.097 --> 53:40.691
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

53:40.866 --> 53:42.493
...chips, dips...

53:42.668 --> 53:46.001
...and good people, just like you two.

53:46.839 --> 53:48.136
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

53:48.307 --> 53:50.036
It's gonna be a crazy night.

53:55.747 --> 53:58.443
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

53:58.617 --> 54:01.142
- Good dip, huh, H. P?
- Mm.

54:01.320 --> 54:05.484
Got tons of it at Costco. You see, I've got
an exclusive membership card.

54:05.657 --> 54:08.626
And with that card, I get access
to the whole place.

54:08.794 --> 54:12.389
I can buy large quantities of anything
at discount prices.

54:12.764 --> 54:14.925
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

54:15.400 --> 54:19.063
No, don't think so.
But I can talk to someone, if you'd like.

54:19.838 --> 54:22.432
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

54:24.143 --> 54:27.078
<i>Feels strange to be going home,</i>
<i>doesn't it?</i>

54:27.412 --> 54:30.939
"I'm not going home, not really."

54:33.785 --> 54:35.582
<i>Oh, bye.</i>

54:40.092 --> 54:43.550
Alrighty, gang.
Who wants to watch <i>Chamber of Secrets?</i>

54:52.171 --> 54:55.231
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

54:55.407 --> 54:57.932
Good to meet you, too. Thank you.
And hey.

54:58.110 --> 55:01.341
That's right. Come in. I'll go in.

55:01.513 --> 55:05.313
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

55:05.484 --> 55:08.817
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

55:08.987 --> 55:10.784
That's all right.
- Bye.

55:10.956 --> 55:14.050
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

55:14.226 --> 55:16.285
Next stop, Azkaban.

55:24.736 --> 55:25.998
Hey.

55:26.405 --> 55:28.566
Do you wanna drive?

55:34.846 --> 55:38.247
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

55:39.585 --> 55:41.883
Whoa. Yep, I got it.

55:47.659 --> 55:49.957
I got an idea.

55:55.634 --> 55:59.934
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

56:03.008 --> 56:07.377
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

56:10.282 --> 56:15.185
This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

56:41.179 --> 56:43.739
This is unreal.

56:43.982 --> 56:46.109
I couldn't agree more.

56:56.328 --> 56:57.659
<i>Ooh</i>

56:59.965 --> 57:01.455
<i>Ooh</i>

57:07.205 --> 57:08.502
<i>Ooh</i>

57:23.955 --> 57:27.789
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

57:28.427 --> 57:32.124
I've never let anyone kiss me
on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

57:56.555 --> 57:58.614
Good evening, Los Angeles.

57:58.790 --> 58:01.987
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

58:03.628 --> 58:05.289
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

58:05.464 --> 58:06.658
I killed her.

58:08.166 --> 58:09.428
I'm a somebody.

58:10.635 --> 58:12.830
I don't know about that.

58:13.004 --> 58:15.598
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

58:15.774 --> 58:18.971
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

58:19.144 --> 58:21.874
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

58:22.047 --> 58:27.041
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

58:27.219 --> 58:31.383
- How many people can this place even hold?
- Like 17,000.

58:31.556 --> 58:36.425
So each one of us invites 1800
of our closest friends.

58:36.595 --> 58:39.530
No need.
I know our music isn't that mainstream.

58:39.698 --> 58:41.529
- What?
- I love doing it.

58:42.033 --> 58:43.500
It's like my photography.

58:43.668 --> 58:46.136
I know there isn't that much demand
for photographs...

58:46.304 --> 58:47.896
...taken while running, but...

58:48.073 --> 58:50.200
I wasn't gonna say anything.

58:50.375 --> 58:53.902
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

58:54.079 --> 58:55.671
You know that when you're a kid...

58:55.847 --> 58:58.475
...but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

58:59.284 --> 59:01.218
I love your music.

59:01.486 --> 59:04.319
Anybody can take a photo standing still.

59:05.290 --> 59:08.885
Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

59:09.060 --> 59:10.721
- Stop.
- Stopping.

59:10.896 --> 59:13.194
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

59:13.365 --> 59:14.764
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

59:14.933 --> 59:16.696
Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

59:16.868 --> 59:21.305
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- All right. I can't please everyone.

59:24.476 --> 59:25.704
Run!

59:25.977 --> 59:27.672
Hello, everybody.

59:27.846 --> 59:33.284
A little vitamin C. Keep your strength up.
I will be right with you.

59:33.452 --> 59:35.613
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

59:40.025 --> 59:42.721
- Lee?
- Hey.

59:42.894 --> 59:45.362
What up, my brizzo?

59:46.698 --> 59:49.792
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

59:50.902 --> 59:53.268
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

59:54.706 --> 59:56.765
What's going on, Norm?

59:56.942 --> 59:58.773
Something's going down on a big scale.

59:58.944 --> 01:00:02.903
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:06.244
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

01:00:06.885 --> 01:00:09.649
Well, we had a nice run.

01:00:09.821 --> 01:00:12.085
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

01:00:12.424 --> 01:00:15.416
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

01:00:15.594 --> 01:00:17.721
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

01:00:17.896 --> 01:00:20.330
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

01:00:20.499 --> 01:00:23.127
You were feeling it.
You were in the loan zone, remember?

01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:24.563
- I was.
- I was watching you.

01:00:24.736 --> 01:00:25.964
Yeah, you were.

01:00:26.137 --> 01:00:29.664
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:33.004
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

01:00:33.178 --> 01:00:36.147
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

01:00:36.314 --> 01:00:38.145
You may be my last loan.

01:00:40.151 --> 01:00:41.880
It's a Ducati.

01:00:42.053 --> 01:00:45.545
I'm thinking it'll get people off my back
about the male nurse thing.

01:00:46.892 --> 01:00:50.384
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:55.026
See you on the other side, Lee.

01:00:57.802 --> 01:00:59.497
Carl.

01:01:01.873 --> 01:01:05.070
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

01:01:05.243 --> 01:01:07.143
Pleasure to meet you.

01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:18.983
Every two months, the typical loan officer
approves 35 to 40 loans.

01:01:19.157 --> 01:01:21.182
You have given out...

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.928
...561.

01:01:24.629 --> 01:01:26.153
A little more than average, then.

01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:28.697
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:36.106
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

01:01:36.274 --> 01:01:38.208
Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

01:01:38.376 --> 01:01:41.368
Carl, this bank traditionally has never
given out small loans.

01:01:41.546 --> 01:01:43.673
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down.

01:01:43.848 --> 01:01:46.316
At first I thought
you might be raiding our coffers.

01:01:46.518 --> 01:01:49.510
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.318
But...

01:01:59.564 --> 01:02:00.895
But then I looked closer.

01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:04.362
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

01:02:04.536 --> 01:02:07.664
...more than 98 percent of them
are following through with payments.

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:09.932
And because you've given out
so many of them...

01:02:10.108 --> 01:02:14.374
...we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-loans, not bad.

01:02:14.746 --> 01:02:16.805
See, Car, you worrywart.

01:02:16.982 --> 01:02:20.543
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

01:02:20.752 --> 01:02:22.982
- Corporate?
- Wow.

01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:25.314
That's great. I would have to say...

01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:28.323
No, wait. Before we give our answer...

01:02:28.493 --> 01:02:30.654
...let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:34.731
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

01:02:35.233 --> 01:02:36.598
Got it. Yep.

01:02:36.768 --> 01:02:39.737
We'll have the employment contract to you
by the end of the day.

01:02:39.904 --> 01:02:42.429
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

01:02:42.607 --> 01:02:47.101
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

01:02:53.852 --> 01:02:55.683
This one is nice.

01:02:55.854 --> 01:02:58.254
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

01:02:58.423 --> 01:02:59.447
- I love it.
- Yeah?

01:02:59.624 --> 01:03:00.989
Yeah.

01:03:01.159 --> 01:03:04.720
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

01:03:04.896 --> 01:03:06.625
It's the same as regular bingo...

01:03:06.798 --> 01:03:10.427
...but you just yell embarrassing facts
about the bride, okay?

01:03:11.503 --> 01:03:12.527
Yeah.

01:03:12.704 --> 01:03:14.604
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

01:03:14.773 --> 01:03:16.365
I don't want anything complicated.

01:03:16.541 --> 01:03:19.339
You gotta squeeze every drop of juice
out of this experience.

01:03:19.511 --> 01:03:21.945
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

01:03:22.113 --> 01:03:25.708
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

01:03:29.087 --> 01:03:33.080
- Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay. I'll talk to her.

01:04:21.973 --> 01:04:22.997
Okay.

01:04:26.745 --> 01:04:29.213
Okay, bridal bingo very simple, okay?

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.816
I can explain to you in more detail
if you want.

01:04:39.424 --> 01:04:40.686
What's going on?

01:04:42.427 --> 01:04:44.486
I mean, someone's trying to kill himself.

01:04:45.764 --> 01:04:47.356
Jump.

01:04:47.966 --> 01:04:50.457
What the hell are you looking at?

01:04:51.503 --> 01:04:55.030
Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

01:04:55.206 --> 01:04:57.106
Hey, lady, move that dog.

01:04:57.709 --> 01:05:00.269
Buddy, can you move over a little bit,
like two feet?

01:05:00.445 --> 01:05:01.912
Has somebody called the police?

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.538
Yeah. He'll be dead before they get here.
Somebody needs to talk him down.

01:05:05.717 --> 01:05:09.050
Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

01:05:27.772 --> 01:05:29.296
Don't do it.

01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:33.309
It can't be that bad.

01:05:35.713 --> 01:05:37.112
Hey, buddy.

01:05:37.749 --> 01:05:39.239
Who are you, man?

01:05:39.417 --> 01:05:43.114
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

01:05:43.755 --> 01:05:46.223
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

01:05:46.391 --> 01:05:49.918
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

01:05:50.495 --> 01:05:52.622
I should say something to you here.

01:05:54.299 --> 01:05:55.857
I don't really know what it is.

01:05:56.034 --> 01:05:58.127
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

01:05:58.303 --> 01:06:00.271
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

01:06:03.174 --> 01:06:06.109
Wait. I've got it.

01:06:09.047 --> 01:06:10.674
Where you going, man?

01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:13.613
I know it's not what I think it is.
- Just stop.

01:06:13.785 --> 01:06:15.343
Oh, man.

01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:24.592
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

01:06:24.762 --> 01:06:27.322
Patience is a virtue.

01:06:30.268 --> 01:06:33.203
What the hell you doing in there?

01:06:35.907 --> 01:06:40.037
<i>I wish you would step back</i>
<i>From that ledge, my friend</i>

01:06:40.879 --> 01:06:46.715
<i>You could cut ties with all the lies</i>
<i>That you've been living in</i>

01:06:46.885 --> 01:06:50.480
<i>And if you never want to see me again</i>

01:06:50.655 --> 01:06:55.820
<i>I would understand</i>

01:06:55.994 --> 01:07:02.991
<i>I would understand</i>

01:07:03.334 --> 01:07:05.165
Um... Oh...

01:07:05.603 --> 01:07:06.729
What is it?

01:07:07.605 --> 01:07:10.233
<i>The angry boy a bit too insane</i>

01:07:10.441 --> 01:07:13.239
<i>Icing over a secret pain</i>

01:07:13.411 --> 01:07:18.644
<i>You know you don't belong</i>

01:07:18.816 --> 01:07:22.980
<i>Everyone I know has got a reason</i>

01:07:23.421 --> 01:07:24.911
<i>To say</i>

01:07:25.089 --> 01:07:26.579
<i>You can put the past away</i>

01:07:26.758 --> 01:07:30.785
<i>I wish you would step back</i>
<i>From that ledge, my friend</i>

01:07:30.962 --> 01:07:35.695
<i>You could cut ties with all the lies</i>
<i>You've been living in</i>

01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:39.564
<i>And if you never want to see me again</i>

01:07:39.737 --> 01:07:44.436
<i>I would understand</i>

01:07:44.609 --> 01:07:47.442
<i>I would understand</i>

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:54.181
<i>I would understand</i>

01:07:54.352 --> 01:07:58.345
<i>I would understand</i>

01:07:59.123 --> 01:08:01.523
<i>I would understand</i>

01:08:10.234 --> 01:08:12.794
I got blisters on my fingers.

01:08:21.112 --> 01:08:22.703
Carl.

01:08:23.147 --> 01:08:25.707
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

01:08:25.883 --> 01:08:27.975
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

01:08:28.152 --> 01:08:31.917
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:36.390
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

01:08:37.428 --> 01:08:41.386
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

01:08:41.566 --> 01:08:44.660
It's just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

01:08:44.836 --> 01:08:47.304
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

01:08:47.471 --> 01:08:49.406
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

01:08:49.573 --> 01:08:53.135
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:56.609
Keeps it fresh. I'll see you guys.

01:08:58.282 --> 01:09:00.876
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

01:09:01.051 --> 01:09:02.747
No.

01:09:14.365 --> 01:09:16.094
So I have some carry-on here.

01:09:16.267 --> 01:09:20.670
I'd like two tickets on the first plane
out of here, please.

01:09:20.837 --> 01:09:22.430
We've never done this before.

01:09:25.176 --> 01:09:29.636
The next flight available for boarding...

01:09:30.214 --> 01:09:31.647
...is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

01:09:33.618 --> 01:09:34.642
Okay.

01:09:34.819 --> 01:09:35.843
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.180
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

01:09:37.354 --> 01:09:38.515
Here we come.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.654
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

01:09:44.828 --> 01:09:47.854
Well, clearly we should go there.

01:09:53.671 --> 01:09:55.866
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets...

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.304
...weighed over 10 and a half pounds."

01:09:58.476 --> 01:10:01.274
- Interesting.
- Look at this.

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.248
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

01:10:05.416 --> 01:10:07.111
Check out the phone.

01:10:07.285 --> 01:10:10.812
Smaller than I thought they would be.
Hold on, I'm vibrating.

01:10:10.988 --> 01:10:12.888
Hello?

01:10:17.228 --> 01:10:18.695
Nice shot.

01:10:20.798 --> 01:10:24.393
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

01:10:25.303 --> 01:10:27.203
So, what do I do? I just...

01:10:28.906 --> 01:10:31.306
Take it easy.
- Here you go.

01:10:33.144 --> 01:10:35.169
- Okay.
- You got it.

01:10:35.346 --> 01:10:36.370
Pull?

01:10:38.249 --> 01:10:40.308
Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

01:10:40.485 --> 01:10:43.386
Can I do it again? Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

01:10:49.393 --> 01:10:51.327
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it...</i>

01:10:51.496 --> 01:10:55.762
<i>... for your University</i>
<i>of Nebraska Cornhuskers.</i>

01:11:03.808 --> 01:11:05.776
Twenty bucks says Oklahoma kills them.

01:11:05.943 --> 01:11:08.503
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

01:11:08.679 --> 01:11:10.271
What, do you live here now?

01:11:10.448 --> 01:11:14.077
Yeah. I asked Carl and he had to say yes.

01:11:14.252 --> 01:11:16.914
Hey. Is that Carl?

01:11:17.088 --> 01:11:19.215
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

01:11:20.591 --> 01:11:25.858
<i>The energy is palpable here,</i>
<i>Chris. I can't even hear myself think.</i>

01:11:26.831 --> 01:11:29.527
- I guess they're in Nebraska.
- Wow.

01:11:30.168 --> 01:11:34.730
Now, this is the really interesting part.
If you don't take the heads off properly...

01:11:34.906 --> 01:11:37.397
...then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

01:11:37.575 --> 01:11:40.567
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

01:11:40.745 --> 01:11:43.509
...and you got a lawsuit on your hands.

01:11:44.815 --> 01:11:47.010
We got a fainter down in Head Removal.

01:11:52.023 --> 01:11:54.685
I can't believe I tripped like that.

01:11:56.027 --> 01:11:59.588
It seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

01:11:59.764 --> 01:12:03.359
Okay. Because I thought it was
all the chicken beaks in the bucket.

01:12:03.534 --> 01:12:05.399
Don't, please.

01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:09.503
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

01:12:10.841 --> 01:12:13.207
Here. I have to protect you.

01:12:13.477 --> 01:12:14.967
Come on.

01:12:15.146 --> 01:12:19.014
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

01:12:19.183 --> 01:12:20.878
Come on.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.915
Get in here. It's okay. I got you.

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:28.820
Allison, are you okay?

01:12:29.493 --> 01:12:32.792
Are you hurt? Are you hurt? You're okay?

01:12:39.303 --> 01:12:40.634
What?

01:12:41.739 --> 01:12:44.264
I don't know. I think I love you.

01:12:45.676 --> 01:12:47.143
Really?

01:12:47.311 --> 01:12:51.907
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:55.382
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

01:12:55.553 --> 01:12:57.282
I love you like...

01:12:57.788 --> 01:13:01.087
...I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

01:13:01.892 --> 01:13:03.359
I've been thinking...

01:13:03.527 --> 01:13:06.018
...and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

01:13:06.197 --> 01:13:11.066
...but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

01:13:12.403 --> 01:13:15.736
Wow. Really? You've been thinking that?

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.867
What do you think?

01:13:18.042 --> 01:13:22.479
- What do I think? Uh... Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

01:13:22.647 --> 01:13:24.114
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

01:13:24.282 --> 01:13:26.250
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:29.045
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:33.122
Come on, what are you talking about?
Here, ask me again.

01:13:33.991 --> 01:13:35.322
- Do you wanna move...
- Yes.

01:13:35.493 --> 01:13:39.987
Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you...

01:13:54.779 --> 01:13:58.408
Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

01:14:01.252 --> 01:14:04.050
I'll just be one minute.

01:14:04.221 --> 01:14:07.713
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

01:14:07.892 --> 01:14:09.723
I'm in.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.724
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:14:15.666 --> 01:14:17.065
Sir?

01:14:18.436 --> 01:14:21.405
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

01:14:21.572 --> 01:14:24.405
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

01:14:27.044 --> 01:14:29.774
You're hilarious. Oh, that's great.

01:14:29.947 --> 01:14:32.745
Oh, beautiful. Are you in on this too?

01:14:32.917 --> 01:14:35.078
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

01:14:35.252 --> 01:14:38.085
There's a crazy man in the terminal.
Red alert.

01:14:39.523 --> 01:14:41.855
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

01:14:42.026 --> 01:14:43.618
Come on, lady.

01:14:45.363 --> 01:14:48.628
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

01:14:48.799 --> 01:14:52.963
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

01:14:53.137 --> 01:14:55.105
Then why are you plotting to attack it?

01:14:55.272 --> 01:14:57.263
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

01:14:57.441 --> 01:14:59.272
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

01:14:59.443 --> 01:15:01.604
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

01:15:01.779 --> 01:15:05.340
- We know what you're planning.
- This is insane. Do you think I'm a terrorist?

01:15:05.516 --> 01:15:08.349
Why did you purchase these plane tickets
at the last minute?

01:15:08.519 --> 01:15:10.612
It was a spontaneous vacation.

01:15:10.788 --> 01:15:12.722
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:16.155
...how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

01:15:16.327 --> 01:15:20.457
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder.com?

01:15:20.664 --> 01:15:23.690
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

01:15:23.868 --> 01:15:26.996
Faranoush. It was nothing. I can explain.
I can explain.

01:15:27.171 --> 01:15:30.937
Explain this, jackhole. As Chief Loan Officer
at Brea Federal Savings and Loan...

01:15:31.108 --> 01:15:33.633
...you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

01:15:33.811 --> 01:15:35.301
- For what, bombs?
- No.

01:15:35.479 --> 01:15:37.674
Have you recently
started taking flying lessons?

01:15:37.848 --> 01:15:40.373
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

01:15:40.551 --> 01:15:42.951
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.680
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

01:15:45.856 --> 01:15:47.983
- You were married?
- Yes.

01:15:48.993 --> 01:15:51.154
That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

01:15:51.328 --> 01:15:53.956
I was gonna tell her. I just never...

01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:57.066
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

01:15:58.202 --> 01:16:02.229
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

01:16:03.541 --> 01:16:05.406
His name was Marx.

01:16:09.113 --> 01:16:11.343
I need to speak to my attorney.

01:16:16.053 --> 01:16:19.181
Several months ago, my client
attended a self-empowerment seminar...

01:16:19.356 --> 01:16:24.191
...that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

01:16:24.361 --> 01:16:26.454
All of the activity
that appears suspicious...

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:29.724
...the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.630
...it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

01:16:33.871 --> 01:16:36.135
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

01:16:36.307 --> 01:16:38.207
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

01:16:38.375 --> 01:16:39.967
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

01:16:40.144 --> 01:16:43.204
I'm wondering if there's a better setting
for this back and forth.

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.349
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

01:16:49.153 --> 01:16:52.316
- Whew. That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:54.458
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

01:16:54.625 --> 01:16:57.492
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

01:16:58.028 --> 01:17:00.053
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

01:17:00.231 --> 01:17:03.962
I thought you lied all the time, but it's
just sometimes. That's excellent.

01:17:04.134 --> 01:17:05.863
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

01:17:06.036 --> 01:17:09.403
...you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

01:17:09.573 --> 01:17:11.404
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

01:17:11.575 --> 01:17:13.566
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

01:17:13.744 --> 01:17:16.178
...that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

01:17:16.347 --> 01:17:18.975
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:21.481
...like an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

01:17:21.652 --> 01:17:22.846
You paused.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.682
You wanted to say no but you couldn't.
You had to say yes.

01:17:25.856 --> 01:17:29.986
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.324
...was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

01:17:41.972 --> 01:17:43.234
Allison.

01:17:44.942 --> 01:17:46.409
Bye, Carl.

01:18:00.658 --> 01:18:04.219
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

01:18:04.995 --> 01:18:06.587
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

01:18:06.764 --> 01:18:09.961
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

01:18:10.134 --> 01:18:12.125
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

01:18:12.303 --> 01:18:15.272
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

01:18:15.439 --> 01:18:17.066
Ever think things got screwed up...

01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:21.109
...because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

01:18:21.278 --> 01:18:23.246
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

01:18:23.414 --> 01:18:25.882
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:29.611
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

01:18:29.787 --> 01:18:31.254
...a.k.a. what normal people do.

01:18:31.422 --> 01:18:34.186
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

01:18:34.358 --> 01:18:35.484
Or not.

01:18:35.659 --> 01:18:37.559
Allison, please, can't we talk for a sec?

01:18:37.728 --> 01:18:39.218
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:41.361
Farther.
- Yeah.

01:18:43.334 --> 01:18:44.733
Carl.

01:18:48.606 --> 01:18:50.073
Bye, Carl.

01:18:50.874 --> 01:18:53.775
- <i>Oh, I just love good food.</i>
- <i>So do I.</i>

01:18:53.944 --> 01:18:55.775
- <i>Do you?</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:18:55.946 --> 01:18:57.880
<i>You know you and I are a lot alike?</i>

01:18:59.116 --> 01:19:01.448
<i>My mother likes good food.</i>

01:19:02.319 --> 01:19:04.947
<i>She always used to say,</i>
<i>"I'd rather eat good food...</i>

01:19:05.122 --> 01:19:07.056
<i>... than bad food any old day</i>
<i>of the week. "</i>

01:19:07.224 --> 01:19:08.782
Hey.

01:19:09.093 --> 01:19:10.958
It's me again.

01:19:11.128 --> 01:19:13.596
Specifically I'm talking about 15
to 20 percent.

01:19:13.764 --> 01:19:16.733
The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the...

01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:35.448
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.982
You're officially flying by yourself.

01:19:40.557 --> 01:19:42.047
Cool.

01:19:42.493 --> 01:19:45.519
There's no greater feeling in the world,
is there?

01:19:48.766 --> 01:19:54.227
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

01:19:54.405 --> 01:19:56.236
I'd like to thank you all for coming...

01:19:56.407 --> 01:19:59.535
...for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:03.373
In an unrelated note,
everyone else can go jump off a bridge.

01:20:15.426 --> 01:20:17.121
Ah!

01:20:34.812 --> 01:20:35.972
Allison?

01:20:36.146 --> 01:20:40.276
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

01:20:40.451 --> 01:20:45.514
- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
- <i>Okay, okay. Just checking in.</i>

01:20:45.689 --> 01:20:47.520
Seeing how Corporate's treating you.

01:20:47.691 --> 01:20:50.091
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:53.991
- <i>I never really thought of them</i> as...
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, just a second.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.494
Wes? Can you hear me?

01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:00.932
<i>Go get the ball!</i>

01:21:01.105 --> 01:21:04.541
So listen, I got a job for you.
We're shutting down a bunch of branches...

01:21:04.708 --> 01:21:08.610
...and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

01:21:09.046 --> 01:21:10.513
Which ones?

01:21:12.182 --> 01:21:14.810
We are Sparta!

01:21:18.555 --> 01:21:19.988
Hi, Norm.

01:21:43.213 --> 01:21:45.511
<i>You have three messages.</i>

01:21:45.682 --> 01:21:48.412
<i>Hi, Car, this is your</i>
<i>answer phone speaking.</i>

01:21:48.585 --> 01:21:51.452
<i>No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder</i>
<i>about the party tonight.</i>

01:21:51.622 --> 01:21:54.682
<i>I'll see you there, buddy. Roger, out.</i>

01:21:55.092 --> 01:21:57.890
<i>Carl, it's Roons.</i>
<i>Thanks for letting me use your car.</i>

01:21:58.061 --> 01:22:00.621
<i>You might notice the front bumper missing.</i>
<i>Not to worry.</i>

01:22:00.798 --> 01:22:03.562
<i>I gave them your insurance.</i>
<i>The whole thing's being handled.</i>

01:22:03.734 --> 01:22:08.103
<i>And I left a pile of laundry in my room.</i>
<i>Don't forget, no starch. Love you.</i>

01:22:08.705 --> 01:22:11.731
<i>It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware</i>
<i>and completely on top of it...</i>

01:22:11.909 --> 01:22:15.675
<i>... but just wanted to make sure Lucy's</i>
<i>shower is still on for tomorrow night.</i>

01:22:15.846 --> 01:22:18.974
<i>Haven't received confirmation</i>
<i>of any sort from you. At all.</i>

01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:21.811
- Shower. Shit.
- <i>It's on.</i>

01:22:21.985 --> 01:22:23.953
<i>Right? Call me.</i>

01:22:36.466 --> 01:22:37.490
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:22:37.668 --> 01:22:40.228
- What's wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

01:22:40.404 --> 01:22:41.666
What?

01:22:41.839 --> 01:22:44.501
Come on inside. I'll explain everything.

01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:52.010
Surprise!

01:22:52.182 --> 01:22:54.776
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

01:22:54.952 --> 01:22:56.419
How did you pull this off?

01:22:56.587 --> 01:22:59.249
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:02.288
I like it, I like it.

01:23:02.459 --> 01:23:03.892
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

01:23:04.061 --> 01:23:06.154
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:08.491
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

01:23:08.966 --> 01:23:11.799
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

01:23:11.969 --> 01:23:14.460
On him, on him.

01:23:17.474 --> 01:23:18.498
Cake?

01:23:18.675 --> 01:23:19.699
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:23:19.877 --> 01:23:24.280
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

01:23:25.849 --> 01:23:28.841
Oh, right. Nailed it.

01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:39.285
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

01:23:39.463 --> 01:23:42.296
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

01:23:42.466 --> 01:23:45.333
You know, taking her day by day.

01:23:45.502 --> 01:23:48.335
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

01:23:48.739 --> 01:23:49.865
Oh.

01:23:54.278 --> 01:23:58.715
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

01:24:00.584 --> 01:24:04.953
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

01:24:05.122 --> 01:24:06.146
Do you dance?

01:24:06.723 --> 01:24:09.214
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

01:24:09.393 --> 01:24:12.954
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

01:24:39.222 --> 01:24:44.854
- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so...

01:24:49.166 --> 01:24:51.031
Oh, jeez.

01:24:51.635 --> 01:24:54.934
- That's the best wedding shower ever, man.
- Man, you deserve it.

01:24:55.105 --> 01:24:57.073
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:00.334
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:03.035
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

01:25:03.213 --> 01:25:07.274
I guess I'll just stick with the program.
Keep saying yes to everything.

01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:09.043
I know it sounds silly...

01:25:09.219 --> 01:25:11.779
...but maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

01:25:11.955 --> 01:25:16.255
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:18.555
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?

01:25:18.729 --> 01:25:21.721
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

01:25:21.898 --> 01:25:24.526
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

01:25:25.469 --> 01:25:28.199
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

01:25:28.372 --> 01:25:30.840
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

01:25:31.008 --> 01:25:32.976
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

01:25:38.448 --> 01:25:40.348
Hi there.

01:25:41.284 --> 01:25:42.911
Hello there.

01:25:43.687 --> 01:25:46.656
You must be Tillie.

01:25:47.691 --> 01:25:52.685
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

01:25:56.199 --> 01:26:02.297
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

01:26:03.707 --> 01:26:05.436
Come on, let's go.

01:26:15.285 --> 01:26:17.845
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

01:26:18.488 --> 01:26:24.358
- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
- <i>Can you come over?</i>

01:26:24.528 --> 01:26:27.395
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

01:26:27.564 --> 01:26:31.432
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

01:26:31.601 --> 01:26:33.330
I don't know.

01:26:34.237 --> 01:26:38.230
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

01:26:39.576 --> 01:26:42.044
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

01:26:42.212 --> 01:26:46.478
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:50.984
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

01:26:51.154 --> 01:26:57.423
Yeah. I'm gonna assume at this point,
it's, well...

01:26:57.594 --> 01:27:00.563
- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph...

01:27:05.402 --> 01:27:07.131
Steph...

01:27:07.804 --> 01:27:09.635
...I can't.

01:27:10.273 --> 01:27:11.968
I'm sorry.

01:27:14.478 --> 01:27:16.412
What are you saying?

01:27:18.048 --> 01:27:20.243
I'm saying no.

01:27:36.733 --> 01:27:38.200
Are you serious?

01:27:52.582 --> 01:27:53.742
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:01.224 --> 01:28:03.749
Oh, please.

01:28:04.261 --> 01:28:07.890
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

01:28:08.064 --> 01:28:12.125
- Sorry, pal. Can't help you.
- Oh, come on. Can't you give me a break?

01:28:12.302 --> 01:28:16.136
No, man, no, man, no, man.

01:28:16.306 --> 01:28:20.504
<i>No man, no man, no man...</i>
- Not possible!

01:28:22.746 --> 01:28:24.873
Jackoff.

01:28:25.949 --> 01:28:31.478
<i>Chapter 26,</i>
<i>"Words That Rhyme With Yes."</i>

01:28:31.655 --> 01:28:34.283
<i>Guess, mess.</i>

01:28:34.457 --> 01:28:40.487
<i>Tess, that's a name.</i>
<i>Less, a word and a name.</i>

01:28:40.664 --> 01:28:42.632
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:10.054
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

01:29:11.461 --> 01:29:15.158
She was coming in the room. It's like,
"Give me some space, woman."

01:29:15.332 --> 01:29:18.893
Again, I'm pretty sure
she was just here checking on Carl.

01:29:19.169 --> 01:29:21.103
Peter.

01:29:21.838 --> 01:29:23.499
A covenant.

01:29:23.673 --> 01:29:25.971
Hey, buddy, you all right?

01:29:26.576 --> 01:29:29.545
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

01:29:30.413 --> 01:29:33.246
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

01:29:33.416 --> 01:29:34.883
It is nonsense.

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.212
It's him.

01:29:39.756 --> 01:29:44.022
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

01:29:44.194 --> 01:29:46.992
First of all, what were you doing
in my car?

01:29:47.163 --> 01:29:49.597
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

01:29:49.766 --> 01:29:53.600
There is no covenant. There never was.
I was just riffing.

01:29:54.638 --> 01:29:56.868
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.703
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

01:30:00.877 --> 01:30:03.846
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

01:30:04.014 --> 01:30:06.107
You just don't know how to use it,
that's all.

01:30:06.283 --> 01:30:09.184
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

01:30:09.352 --> 01:30:11.320
No, that's not the point.

01:30:11.488 --> 01:30:15.288
Well, maybe at first it is,
but that's just to open you up to it...

01:30:15.458 --> 01:30:17.085
...to get you started.

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.888
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

01:30:20.063 --> 01:30:22.497
...not because a covenant tells you to...

01:30:22.666 --> 01:30:25.601
...but because you know in your heart
that you want to.

01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:28.531
Yeah.

01:30:29.105 --> 01:30:30.834
You're right.

01:30:31.574 --> 01:30:34.475
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

01:30:34.644 --> 01:30:36.043
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

01:30:36.212 --> 01:30:38.772
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

01:30:39.382 --> 01:30:43.443
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about the car,
and your head there.

01:30:44.254 --> 01:30:48.122
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

01:30:48.291 --> 01:30:49.553
Perfect.

01:30:52.362 --> 01:30:54.125
I said that.

01:30:54.331 --> 01:30:55.958
Whatever.

01:30:57.801 --> 01:31:01.362
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

01:31:05.642 --> 01:31:08.110
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

01:31:08.278 --> 01:31:10.610
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

01:31:13.183 --> 01:31:17.142
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:21.689
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

01:31:21.858 --> 01:31:26.295
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:29.057
Ducati.

01:31:34.003 --> 01:31:37.439
Have you ever driven one of these before?
They're quite powerful.

01:31:37.607 --> 01:31:40.804
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

01:31:40.977 --> 01:31:43.309
No, Carl, this is not the same.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.472
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

01:31:47.484 --> 01:31:49.452
Holy Jesus.

01:31:49.619 --> 01:31:50.881
- torque.

01:32:03.299 --> 01:32:05.358
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

01:32:07.237 --> 01:32:08.465
Ah!

01:32:08.972 --> 01:32:10.803
You might wanna get out of the way.

01:32:22.085 --> 01:32:24.485
Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

01:32:27.557 --> 01:32:28.615
Ah!

01:32:32.495 --> 01:32:33.894
Whoa!

01:33:18.341 --> 01:33:20.104
What an asshole.

01:33:36.326 --> 01:33:37.884
Carl, what are you doing here?

01:33:38.061 --> 01:33:41.963
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't wanna live with you.

01:33:42.131 --> 01:33:45.225
Oh, wow. Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

01:33:45.401 --> 01:33:47.892
Okay, people, let's go.

01:33:51.441 --> 01:33:52.533
But I wanna be with you.

01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:54.904
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't know you.

01:33:55.078 --> 01:33:57.638
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

01:33:57.814 --> 01:34:00.146
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's big.

01:34:00.316 --> 01:34:02.910
We shouldn't just jump into that
without thinking.

01:34:03.086 --> 01:34:07.045
Why not? You do it with everything.
You say yes to whatever comes your way.

01:34:07.223 --> 01:34:10.192
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.885
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you get that?
Your literature?

01:34:13.062 --> 01:34:15.053
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

01:34:15.231 --> 01:34:18.997
You think? Seems pretty airtight to me.

01:34:19.168 --> 01:34:22.137
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

01:34:22.305 --> 01:34:25.399
Because the old Carl
didn't think he was enough for anybody.

01:34:25.575 --> 01:34:28.601
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

01:34:28.778 --> 01:34:31.110
...sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

01:34:31.648 --> 01:34:34.116
I didn't think I had anything to share.

01:34:34.284 --> 01:34:37.549
But now I know that what I have to share
is pretty huge, and I wanna share it with you.

01:34:38.888 --> 01:34:41.015
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

01:34:41.190 --> 01:34:43.215
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

01:34:43.826 --> 01:34:46.294
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

01:34:46.462 --> 01:34:49.795
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

01:34:49.966 --> 01:34:53.026
...and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

01:34:53.202 --> 01:34:55.136
You weren't scared of anything.

01:34:55.305 --> 01:34:57.967
You don't think I'm scared of anything?

01:34:58.141 --> 01:35:01.304
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

01:35:01.911 --> 01:35:03.902
And I'm scared too.

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.139
So let's be scared together.

01:35:08.084 --> 01:35:10.075
I don't know what you want me to say.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.187
So just say yes...

01:35:12.722 --> 01:35:15.156
...but only if you really want to.

01:35:15.391 --> 01:35:18.519
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

01:35:19.829 --> 01:35:21.660
Yeah, I noticed that.

01:35:22.198 --> 01:35:23.563
Well?

01:35:30.373 --> 01:35:32.603
- Maybe.
- Come on.

01:35:33.476 --> 01:35:37.071
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

01:35:44.053 --> 01:35:45.714
I like maybe.

01:35:45.888 --> 01:35:47.082
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

01:36:14.017 --> 01:36:17.475
Excuse me,
but pleats are kind of out of style.

01:36:17.654 --> 01:36:19.815
You got anything with a flat front?

01:36:19.989 --> 01:36:21.923
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.993
Thanks, guys.

01:36:26.162 --> 01:36:28.756
This is the single biggest donation
that we've ever had.

01:36:28.931 --> 01:36:31.491
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

01:36:31.668 --> 01:36:33.033
You're a good man, Carl.

01:36:33.202 --> 01:36:37.730
No big deal. I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

01:36:39.208 --> 01:36:44.544
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

01:36:44.714 --> 01:36:49.151
And the word
you will have said 2 million times is:

01:36:49.318 --> 01:36:51.650
Yes!

01:36:57.126 --> 01:36:59.287
Good God.

01:38:33.389 --> 01:38:35.516
So anything else we need to know?

01:38:35.691 --> 01:38:39.957
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:41.687
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

01:38:41.864 --> 01:38:43.229
Right.

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:45.831
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

01:38:46.002 --> 01:38:48.698
I never could have finished the suits
without it.

01:38:50.406 --> 01:38:53.933
Listen, I'm not gonna think anything
less of you if you don't wanna do this.

01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:55.134
What?

01:38:55.311 --> 01:38:58.246
I mean, I'm still gonna be attracted
to you if you're a chicken.

01:38:58.414 --> 01:39:00.075
What if I'm one of those chickens...

01:39:00.249 --> 01:39:03.548
...whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

01:39:03.719 --> 01:39:06.654
I'll see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:10.382
I told you, my foot caught a nail.

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.788
Hiyah!

01:39:58.641 --> 01:40:00.165
I love this.

01:44:19.001 --> 01:44:20.993
