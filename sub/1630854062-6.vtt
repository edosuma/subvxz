00:06.214 --> 00:08.550
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

00:08.633 --> 00:11.803
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

00:23.106 --> 00:24.399
Hello, Mr. Kang.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.484
Think you're better than me?

00:30.113 --> 00:31.906
You asshole.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.618
You think I don't know what you're up to.
Is that it?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.061
Eungsoo.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.342
The target of this op is Jeon Yohan,

02:14.425 --> 02:16.678
who controls cocaine distribution
in Suriname.

02:18.179 --> 02:22.350
You will enter Paramaribo
as soon as Jeon's cocaine is confirmed

02:22.433 --> 02:23.560
to be in American territory.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.603
Afterwards,

02:26.229 --> 02:30.984
infiltrate Jeon's residence with the LZ
just northwest of the compound.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.945
After suppressing any local resistance,

02:34.821 --> 02:35.780
secure the target.

02:35.864 --> 02:39.617
Capturing Jeon alive
is of utmost importance,

02:39.701 --> 02:43.413
as he must stand trial
in American and South Korean courts,

02:43.496 --> 02:46.332
in addition to exposing
his connection to the Cali Cartel.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.627
How much resistance can we expect?

02:49.711 --> 02:51.963
Twenty heavily armed personal bodyguards

02:52.046 --> 02:55.133
from a Nigerian terrorist group
stay with Jeon at all times.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.307
All right, glad that's got your attention.

03:02.807 --> 03:06.144
Plus, 20 to 30 followers
armed and trained.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.605
I'm told there are NIS agents on site?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.024
One agent, to be precise.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.818
A former special forces soldier.

03:14.319 --> 03:18.698
He infiltrated Jeon's organization
and is one of his confidants.

03:18.781 --> 03:22.410
We are in close contact with him
to monitor the situation on the ground.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.120
And

03:24.204 --> 03:27.207
we also have a civilian informant in play.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.924
He will get out of the way
as soon as the op begins.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.175
What if he can't?

03:37.258 --> 03:40.094
It won't be easy to protect a civilian
in the middle of the op.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.138
We'll have to exclude him from the plan.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.773
<i> Dad,</i>
<i>are you really coming back soon?</i>

03:52.607 --> 03:56.069
Of course. I've been keeping an eye
on your report card too.

03:56.152 --> 03:59.322
That always puts me in a good mood.
Are you being nice to your sister?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.116
<i>She only ever wants to play sports.</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:05.078
<i>She's so bad at math, Dad,</i>
<i>but I've been teaching her.</i>

04:05.161 --> 04:07.121
<i>Nuh-uh! I'm good at math too!</i>

04:07.622 --> 04:10.333
Hey, both of you just keep doing
what you're best at, all right?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.502
-Now pass the phone to Mom.
-<i>Okay.</i>

04:13.628 --> 04:16.381
-<i>So when will you be back?</i>
-Tomorrow.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.759
Or at least I should be.
If not, this weekend.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.261
<i>Come home.</i>

04:22.387 --> 04:24.138
<i>They're growing up so fast.</i>

04:24.222 --> 04:26.099
<i>I have to go. It's their bedtime.</i>

04:26.182 --> 04:27.684
Hmm, okay. Hmm.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.744
SOUTHWEST FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
USA

04:48.162 --> 04:51.207
As soon as the cocaine
gets to Puerto Rico on the flight,

04:51.291 --> 04:53.126
the DEA will be all over it.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.461
Getting you onboard that plane

04:55.545 --> 04:57.922
and out of Suriname
is the number one priority.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.426
Why would I want to stay?
The operation will be over, right?

05:01.509 --> 05:02.969
<i>I'm sick of Suriname.</i>

05:03.052 --> 05:05.722
Right.
Sounds like I'll be seeing you soon.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.226
I'm so sorry I'm late.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.185
Here.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.687
Thanks.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.782
Wow, we just couldn't have asked
for a better day, could we?

05:24.866 --> 05:28.828
"What you decide upon, it will be done,
and light will shine on your ways."

05:29.996 --> 05:32.623
So, it's a sign
everything will go smoothly.

05:33.499 --> 05:37.086
My god is here for us,
since we are more rich in faith.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.838
Shall we go?

05:39.714 --> 05:40.548
Let's go!

06:24.592 --> 06:25.927
Ah!

06:28.262 --> 06:29.931
Nothing quit like that smell.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.810
I think it's a smell I could get used to.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.073
Why don't we cut to the chase?

06:47.156 --> 06:49.992
There's a great deal of concern upstairs
about the remaining payment.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.496
We can't send our men in
without an NIS guarantor.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.675
Sorry.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.593
I quit smoking after Iraq.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.387
Smoking room's right there.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.139
Oh, sorry.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.433
Can I make a call?

07:14.559 --> 07:15.393
By all means.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.312
OFFICE OF NIS DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON D.C.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.149
What? Is this funny to you?

07:22.316 --> 07:23.401
You prick.

07:23.484 --> 07:27.196
You're honestly asking if the agency
can be a guarantor for mercenaries?

07:28.030 --> 07:29.282
This op is done.

07:29.365 --> 07:30.741
Director,

07:30.825 --> 07:35.204
Jeon is putting his product on the plane,
and the DEA's ready to back us up now.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.332
I have to capture him.
That's all that's left. Why would we quit?

07:47.758 --> 07:50.678
Agent, everything's all set?

07:50.761 --> 07:52.221
-Are you sure?
-<i>Of course.</i>

07:52.305 --> 07:54.599
Your decision is the final piece, sir.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.143
You've been overseeing the operation
since the get go.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.855
We're not moving on this
until you give the all clear.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.276
Shit.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.862
My, you're persuasive.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.739
The final decision is yours.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.241
Your approval will decide this
once and for all.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.129
All right, Choi.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.798
I'll provide the guarantee,
you bring him in.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.885
<i>And we're gonna have a conversation</i>
<i>when you're back.</i>

08:30.968 --> 08:31.844
<i>Get moving!</i>

08:31.928 --> 08:33.012
I appreciate it.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.182
Yes!

08:38.017 --> 08:39.101
Yes!

08:46.776 --> 08:48.819
Pastor, the plane is ready to go.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.947
Okay. Pack up the goods.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.339
Oh.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.341
Hey.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.969
<i>Hey, Ingu,</i>
<i>have you been eating well?</i>

09:13.052 --> 09:16.180
Ah, we're just about to have our dessert
after a great lunch.

09:16.764 --> 09:21.394
Everything's ready here, so I'll text you
the details about the time and location.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.104
The flight to Puerto Rico is leaving soon.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.480
Excellent work.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.732
Hey, we should grab a drink later
to celebrate.

09:27.525 --> 09:31.320
Yeah, just…
make sure the goods get here safe.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.572
Can you do that?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.740
What? Do you think so little of me?

09:36.284 --> 09:38.869
All right, just be sure
to eat on the airplane, yeah?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.663
See you soon. Bye.

09:41.998 --> 09:42.832
Hmm.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.421
Oh, here's his text.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.050
He says they've set 1:00 p.m.
for the rendezvous,

09:53.134 --> 09:56.887
and that the location is Runway Three
at the airport in Vieques.

09:58.723 --> 09:59.557
Okay, then.

10:00.516 --> 10:01.517
So shall we?

10:05.438 --> 10:08.316
VIEQUES AIRPORT, PUERTO RICO

10:24.874 --> 10:27.835
Let's go!
Two hours till the start of the operation.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.141
Look at this.

10:42.224 --> 10:45.436
The president even sent us
his best Air Force pilot.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.731
Looks like he's finally doing his job
after you told him off.

10:49.732 --> 10:53.569
All right. I'll take all this over
and be back with loads of cash.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.863
Wait a minute.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.787
Here's a thought.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.539
Why don't you just stay here?

11:06.332 --> 11:07.458
What? Why?

11:07.541 --> 11:09.460
I'd love to talk with you.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.045
Mm-hmm, let's do that.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.422
Puerto Rico's not far.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.759
-Mr. Lee can go instead.
-Yes, Pastor.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.224
Wait.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.810
There are rules in this business.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.063
To not be there in person would be rude.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.565
I thought you were hoping
to build an empire.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.402
Hmm. Good point, Ingu.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.320
So, let's say I go with you.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.407
But it'll be a hassle.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.617
All right. Let's go.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.789
Tell me. Why bother going
just to fly back right away

11:46.872 --> 11:48.541
when we could be drinking soju?

11:50.376 --> 11:54.505
Uh, I'm not so sure that Sangman's
going to be thrilled about all this.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.885
We don't need the guy's permission
for everything.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.393
I agree. I'll just go call
and give him an update.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.612
You should come yourself, Ingu.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.198
You better catch another flight.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.784
As a key piece in this,
you have to be there.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.619
<i>That won't be possible.</i>

12:25.703 --> 12:26.787
<i>Once the deal is finished,</i>

12:26.871 --> 12:29.165
<i>I'll have a better idea</i>
<i>of what comes next.</i>

12:29.248 --> 12:30.791
You can't honestly be serious.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.378
Do you want to put me on the phone
with the pastor?

12:34.462 --> 12:35.963
<i>I don't think he'll change his mind.</i>

12:36.756 --> 12:39.842
<i>It seemed like he and the deacon</i>
<i>were already agreed.</i>

12:39.925 --> 12:40.760
I see.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.095
All right, then.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.681
I'll call you.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.308
Once the deal is done.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.143
<i>Okay. Sounds good.</i>

12:49.226 --> 12:50.186
<i>Good luck.</i>

12:50.269 --> 12:51.103
Okay.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.822
Mr. Kang is staying behind.
Jeon didn't let him leave.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.908
Do you think Jeon knows what we're doing?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.826
If so, he would've backed out.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.912
I think he's just being cautious.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.040
Lee Sangjun's coming instead.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.584
What if the plane gets here
and there's no coke?

13:14.293 --> 13:18.714
What if he loaded fake goods instead
just to see how we'd react?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.053
Okay.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.057
The safety of Mr. Kang is our priority.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.227
INTEREST-FREE LOANS
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU WON

13:31.310 --> 13:32.144
ONE MILLION COUPONS FOR NEW CUSTOMERS
WE AIM FOR "SAFE BUSINESS"

13:32.228 --> 13:33.562
SEND

13:50.746 --> 13:52.414
Are you disappointed?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.921
I'm not too heartbroken, but it's a shame.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.216
I heard there was
going to be a pool party.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.095
Mr. Kang.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.348
The pool party isn't what matters here.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.017
Right.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.566
Byun, what're you doing?

14:19.275 --> 14:20.901
This is the best part.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.194
Yes, Pastor.

14:24.822 --> 14:28.492
<i>In this world, no one tells me</i>

14:28.576 --> 14:32.162
<i>Which is a forest</i>

14:33.747 --> 14:38.752
<i>And which is a swamp</i>

14:55.519 --> 15:00.900
Registration number 113-25.
Salvation Army transport, Red Shield.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.527
Request permission
to enter Puerto Rico's airspace.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.241
The control tower
has granted them authorization.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.452
ETA, 15 minutes.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.750
Why do you think he made me stay?
Does he suspect?

15:17.833 --> 15:20.085
It does seem like Jeon's
holding you hostage.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.547
But I still haven't figured out why
just yet.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.134
So, you wait for my signal.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.345
I'll distract the pastor,
and you get the embassy.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.848
What happens if he figures this thing out?
We'll be done.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.312
That is not your problem now.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.272
You just worry
about keeping yourself safe.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.276
The operation matters to me.
I risked my life for this thing.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.071
What are you going to do
if he manages to get away?

15:47.154 --> 15:49.907
He'll be gone forever
if he makes it into the jungle.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.910
That won't happen on my watch.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.954
I've heard that before.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.206
This whole mess is on you guys.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.458
You think I wanted to be here? Huh?

16:02.002 --> 16:05.297
We've gotta make sure he can't run.
I'll sabotage his car's engine.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.634
So you'll have to stall him
so I could do it, okay?

16:08.717 --> 16:11.095
Are you sure you can pull it off?

16:11.845 --> 16:14.056
You know I ran a shop for a decade?

16:14.139 --> 16:16.266
You're just gonna have to trust me
on this one.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.979
What are you guys talking about?

16:23.691 --> 16:24.900
It's funny.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.319
From back there, you look friendly.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.071
-You two close?
-Ha!

16:29.154 --> 16:30.864
No, we're not close.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.576
This lunatic won't stop flipping the meat
even though I told him not to.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.620
And he won't stop whining about it.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.579
Listen, Pastor.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.916
This little blowhard won't stop telling me
that I'm grilling wrong.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.044
Apparently,
you taught him to grill like this.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.047
My parents died when I was nine.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.425
After that, the very first job I had

16:49.508 --> 16:51.427
was delivering meat in Majang-dong.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.679
So when it comes to meat,

16:54.763 --> 16:57.057
you don't know squat compared to me.

16:58.225 --> 17:01.061
All I'm saying
is if you grill pork this way,

17:01.145 --> 17:02.896
you run the risk of losing the juices.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.814
Hey.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.192
Stop shit-talking the meat
and grab some sausages.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.527
The Johnsonville ones.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.237
Okay.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.098
Don't worry, I got it.
I'll call you back later, okay?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.809
What are you doing here?

18:23.185 --> 18:25.062
Calling my wife in my car.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.272
That's all.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.232
Excuse me.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.317
Thanks.

18:50.587 --> 18:51.547
Hey!

18:53.674 --> 18:55.134
The Pastor wants to see you now.

18:55.926 --> 18:56.802
Now?

18:57.511 --> 18:58.637
No.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.721
I have another call.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.765
I said right now!

19:04.101 --> 19:04.935
Go!

19:06.019 --> 19:06.854
Okay.

19:17.906 --> 19:18.907
Hey.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.326
What took you so long? The meat's ready.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.831
Oh, my wife called. Kids' school stuff.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.499
Is that all of the Johnsonville?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.042
No.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.128
Too many of them. Couldn't manage.

19:43.640 --> 19:47.561
All right, listen up.
Our main priority is Operation Virginia.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.397
First, no unnecessary shots.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.107
Second, be quick.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.027
The objective is to confirm
possession of cocaine.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.446
Not start a fucking war, all right?

19:57.529 --> 19:59.865
-Yes, sir.
-They've landed.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.671
Welcome to Puerto Rico!

20:16.089 --> 20:18.550
Thanks for coming all this way.
Hello, Deacon Lee.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.136
Who's this guy?

20:25.432 --> 20:27.226
I shouldn't introduce him in the open.

20:27.809 --> 20:31.021
Put simply, he's going to be liaising
with the US Army.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.357
Shall we check the goods now?

20:34.149 --> 20:36.944
Well, actually,
Pastor told me to check the money.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.246
The most important this is the money.
I get that,

20:47.329 --> 20:50.958
but you wave cash around out here,
the cops will be on us.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.461
Once I check the cargo,
you'll get the cash.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.213
Mr. Goo. What's going on?

20:56.296 --> 20:58.882
We don't have time to waste here.
This is fucking dangerous.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.759
I know. I know, I know.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.552
Hey, calm down. Calm down.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.933
Give me a minute to check.

21:24.491 --> 21:28.412
Wow! Pork is tender and juicy
as rib-eye steak. Delicious!

21:28.495 --> 21:29.329
Mm-hmm.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.581
A miracle like the fish in loaves.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.549
As I thought.
I'm supposed to check the money first.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.637
Come on. I'm dying out here, man.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.764
Are you really that dumb? Huh?

21:48.432 --> 21:50.183
-Is there a problem?
-Hold on.

21:51.935 --> 21:52.978
I can handle it.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.984
All right. You win.

21:59.067 --> 22:03.238
Bring the plane into the hangar first
and check out the money there.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.950
My men are waiting for me, okay?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.078
Quick. Before we're spotted out here.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.842
You heard him.
He needs to check the money first.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.844
-Out of the question.
-I know.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.555
But he's not from Virginia like you.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.640
I guess this is Paramaribo style.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.059
Let's just go with it.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.022
Wait!

22:37.606 --> 22:39.566
It's a change of plans!

22:39.649 --> 22:40.734
He's saying…

22:40.817 --> 22:41.943
<i>All right, then.</i>

22:42.569 --> 22:44.571
<i>Let's go with the Paramaribo style.</i>

22:45.530 --> 22:48.367
Abort Operation Virginia,
initiate Paramaribo!

22:48.450 --> 22:50.077
Prepare live rounds!

23:30.826 --> 23:31.660
Right.

23:32.452 --> 23:35.122
The money's all there.
Wanna see for yourself?

23:55.392 --> 23:58.353
We're with NIS.
Slowly put your hands up.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.521
Don't move!

24:00.730 --> 24:02.441
DEA! You're under arrest!

24:02.941 --> 24:04.526
Drop your weapons and get on the ground!

24:05.402 --> 24:07.946
Drop your weapons and get on the ground!

24:08.029 --> 24:09.156
I repeat!

24:09.239 --> 24:11.366
Drop your weapons and get on the ground!

24:14.244 --> 24:15.078
Shit!

24:15.954 --> 24:17.998
Hold your fire! Don't shoot!

24:26.423 --> 24:29.009
I believe in the Almighty Father,
and my lord--

24:29.092 --> 24:31.636
-Sangjun, it's all over.
-I believe in Jesus Christ…

24:31.720 --> 24:34.264
You're a criminal
and a disgrace to Korea.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.849
…by the Holy Spirit.

24:35.932 --> 24:36.933
That's enough. Come on.

24:37.017 --> 24:40.520
…who suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, and died.

24:43.398 --> 24:47.027
I believe in the communion of saints,
and the forgiveness of sins,

24:47.110 --> 24:50.655
and the resurrection of the body,
and in life everlasting.

25:07.964 --> 25:08.882
We got it.

25:10.050 --> 25:13.553
We have confirmed possession of cocaine
in US territory in Puerto Rico.

25:13.637 --> 25:18.225
This site is now under DEA jurisdiction
and I ask for your full cooperation.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.230
PMC "BLUE TARGET" BASE, VENEZUELA

25:23.730 --> 25:27.359
Okay, okay! Let's go, let's go!

25:27.442 --> 25:28.360
Let's go!

25:48.421 --> 25:51.675
<i>Agent Choi,</i>
<i>Jeon is still sending messages to Lee.</i>

25:51.758 --> 25:54.594
<i>He's asking him for an update.</i>
<i>What do we do? Over.</i>

25:54.678 --> 25:58.056
Check their message history
and send back a similar reply.

25:58.557 --> 26:02.435
Do what you need to do
to keep him off of us until we get there.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.938
Buy us more time. Over.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.274
ETA?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.693
Forty minutes to Suriname airspace.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.624
Any word from Mr. Goo?

26:25.208 --> 26:27.877
No, he said he'd call when it's all done.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.462
Why? Is Lee not responding?

26:55.614 --> 26:56.906
PASTOR

27:04.164 --> 27:06.374
Pretty soon, he'll be in our custody.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.170
Do you honestly believe
that after all this, he'll just confess?

27:10.253 --> 27:12.631
He'll need someone to take the fall.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.258
And who do you think that'll be?

27:16.384 --> 27:18.970
The Lord God is punishing us for our sins.

27:19.679 --> 27:23.433
The heathen brought us to this.

27:51.127 --> 27:51.961
Shit.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.802
You know what the sentence is
for drug trafficking?

27:58.885 --> 28:01.137
In Korea, you can get up to ten years.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.935
But if we hand you over to the DEA,

28:07.644 --> 28:09.562
you'll rot in a US jail…

28:10.939 --> 28:12.565
till you die. Understood?

28:13.775 --> 28:15.110
It's your choice.

28:18.571 --> 28:22.867
You cannot persecute or threaten me
with the mortal laws of man.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.828
I know.

28:24.911 --> 28:25.745
I know that.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.998
It's not a threat, it's just a fact.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.043
We're gonna make sure the DEA
releases you into our custody

28:32.127 --> 28:33.920
and get you the lighter sentence.

28:34.003 --> 28:38.425
All you gotta do is lie to the pastor
over the phone now. Hmm?

28:43.763 --> 28:46.266
PASTOR

28:50.270 --> 28:51.980
Okay.

28:52.772 --> 28:55.483
I am taking this call now,
whether you like it or not.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.152
Lie to him or don't,

28:57.235 --> 28:59.112
but your fate is in your hands.

29:00.822 --> 29:01.656
Understood?

29:13.668 --> 29:15.462
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

29:16.546 --> 29:17.756
I'm here, Pastor.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.675
<i>Why didn't you pick up before?</i>
<i>It's been ringing forever.</i>

29:22.343 --> 29:23.928
<i>Hello? What's wrong?</i>

29:28.057 --> 29:29.934
There's bad reception, Father.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.062
I handed over the goods
and checked the cash.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.481
It went smoothly, Pastor.

29:37.025 --> 29:37.901
When I get back,

29:40.028 --> 29:41.446
why don't you and I have a drink?

29:42.614 --> 29:44.073
<i>A drink? Really?</i>

29:44.741 --> 29:46.659
<i>All right.</i>

29:48.953 --> 29:52.040
<i>I've got a great bottle</i>
<i>of champagne chilling now.</i>

29:52.123 --> 29:53.416
<i>Come back in one piece.</i>

29:53.500 --> 29:54.793
I will, Pastor.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.801
He'll be back soon with all the money.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.386
I should go and prepare the champagne.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.138
Hallelujah.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.695
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

31:03.778 --> 31:06.614
LAST INVITATION FOR VIP
VISIT HERE IN TEN MINUTES

31:16.749 --> 31:18.668
Ten minutes to Suriname airspace.

31:30.597 --> 31:31.931
I have a question.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.560
What are you doing in Puerto Rico now?

31:36.144 --> 31:38.771
I'm in Puerto Rico?

31:39.522 --> 31:41.316
You asked me to stay in Suriname.

31:43.401 --> 31:49.574
I mean, what are Sangman and you
planning to do in Puerto Rico?

31:50.658 --> 31:52.410
You trying to take my coke?

31:53.077 --> 31:54.495
Sell it all on your own?

32:03.463 --> 32:05.632
Have you lost your mind?

32:05.715 --> 32:09.302
I thought you said Sangjun's coming back
since it went so well.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.514
He asked if we could share
a drink together.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.475
Now, does he strike you as a drinker?

32:16.768 --> 32:20.772
Tell me what's going on.
Is Sangman holding Sangjun hostage?

32:23.650 --> 32:25.109
Or is it that maybe

32:25.193 --> 32:28.071
he's hoping to have a drink
with his boss to celebrate?

32:28.696 --> 32:31.574
You motherfucking liar.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.036
Unless you want me to blow your head off,

32:35.119 --> 32:36.829
you'll tell me where my goods are.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.678
What a mood killer.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.514
How about you radio the plane then?

32:55.974 --> 32:59.435
Weren't we supposed to be celebrating
the deal with champagne?

33:19.205 --> 33:20.707
We don't have much time.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.751
Go straight to the coordinates
and detain the mark in ten minutes.

33:24.502 --> 33:28.047
Fly as low as possible to avoid radar,
until we reach Suriname airspace.

33:28.798 --> 33:29.632
Pastor.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.763
<i> I just checked with Air Force.</i>

33:35.847 --> 33:38.933
They're in contact
with the Salvation Army pilot.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.144
They say no problem.

33:41.811 --> 33:45.648
If you'd like, I can check again.

33:47.650 --> 33:48.776
Yes, please.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.905
I'm really sorry to put it like this.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.617
You have trust issues. Serious ones.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.121
What about the open-mindedness of faith?

34:01.706 --> 34:04.751
I am very open-minded,

34:04.834 --> 34:08.588
yet the devil spawn won't stop testing me.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.183
No, no!

34:21.350 --> 34:23.311
I'm sure there's a problem.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.731
Look into things, whatever it takes.

34:32.403 --> 34:34.864
SURINAME AIR FORCE BASE

34:48.169 --> 34:50.296
<i>We're approaching the border.</i>
<i>Stand by.</i>

34:56.094 --> 35:00.181
<i>You have entered</i>
<i>the Republic of Suriname airspace.</i>

35:00.264 --> 35:03.935
<i>If you do not present</i>
<i>your flight identification number,</i>

35:04.018 --> 35:05.937
<i>you will be shot down.</i>

35:06.020 --> 35:07.730
This is the US DEA.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.483
We are entering Suriname
to capture a drug lord

35:10.566 --> 35:13.194
who has transported drugs into the US.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.071
We're enforcing
the law of the United States.

35:15.154 --> 35:19.200
Therefore, we urgently request
your unconditional cooperation.

35:29.752 --> 35:32.463
Four minutes to coordinates.
Fly as low as possible.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.025
Hold on!

35:53.109 --> 35:57.655
Air Force say DEA crossed border
into my country!

35:59.866 --> 36:02.577
Did you break our rule
and sell coke to US?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.662
Why are they in Suriname!

36:05.621 --> 36:06.831
I'll handle it.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.041
Just stay on them.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.046
Shit!

36:17.258 --> 36:18.426
DEA?

36:20.469 --> 36:22.471
How long you've been with the DEA?

36:23.306 --> 36:24.515
How long was it?

36:25.683 --> 36:27.643
Ever since you screwed up
my skate business?

36:27.727 --> 36:30.688
Or was it the first day I arrived here?

36:31.397 --> 36:32.607
Memory's fuzzy.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.075
I thought you were possessed by Satan.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.871
It turns out you're just a rat.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.878
Time's up. You better answer me!

36:55.046 --> 36:57.340
Tell me where the coke is.

36:57.423 --> 36:59.342
In the US you're so scared of.

37:00.551 --> 37:03.262
If you want it, why don't you go get it?

37:04.972 --> 37:07.308
Piece of shit rat! Fuck you!

37:13.189 --> 37:14.440
Yes, Mr. President.

37:14.523 --> 37:15.900
<i>What's going on?</i>

37:15.983 --> 37:18.444
<i>DEA's not on our radar!</i>

37:46.722 --> 37:48.683
Send the Air Force and shoot them down.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.810
What? Attack America?

37:51.435 --> 37:53.437
That's the only way to survive.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.107
And send the fucking troops here!

37:59.944 --> 38:01.946
I was helping you get rich.

38:02.822 --> 38:07.118
And then you pull this idiotic shit?

38:07.618 --> 38:08.452
Oh.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.122
I don't understand.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.180
What are you doing, Byun?

38:40.568 --> 38:42.486
<i>The target is on the roof.</i>

38:42.570 --> 38:43.821
<i>Take caution.</i>

38:43.904 --> 38:46.741
<i>The informant and the NIS agent</i>
<i>are also present.</i>

38:51.662 --> 38:54.248
On the rooftop. Target secured.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.709
Armed men are gathered
at the south entrance of the compound.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.337
Five more men approaching
from three o'clock.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.340
Six men gathered
in front of the main building entrance.

39:03.007 --> 39:07.261
Behind the north building,
two, four… six men.

39:13.809 --> 39:14.727
Jeon Yohan.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.481
It's over. Surrender to us.

39:32.912 --> 39:33.996
Oh shit!

39:44.757 --> 39:46.675
-Fuck!
-Damn it!

39:52.515 --> 39:55.309
-Pastor! Pastor! We have to go!
-Let go!

39:55.393 --> 39:56.769
Let go! Shit!

39:56.852 --> 39:58.270
Hey! Ah!

40:04.360 --> 40:05.194
Go, go, go!

40:14.912 --> 40:15.871
Okay! Go!

40:18.165 --> 40:20.876
Pile of shit! Let go! Let go!

40:23.462 --> 40:24.588
Fucking hell!

40:30.386 --> 40:32.388
Take Pastor! Protect Pastor!

40:39.478 --> 40:40.312
Shit!

41:10.342 --> 41:12.595
-It's not working!
-Shit!

41:22.229 --> 41:25.024
Hey! Hey, President!

41:25.107 --> 41:26.108
Where is the army?

41:27.276 --> 41:28.527
Shit!

41:29.195 --> 41:30.863
You lost your mind?

41:30.946 --> 41:33.491
Send the fucking soldiers right now,
you fucking asshole!

41:35.951 --> 41:37.453
Over here, Pastor! Over here!

41:37.953 --> 41:39.413
Go! Hurry! Go, go, go!

42:15.616 --> 42:16.992
Gallas, please!

42:17.535 --> 42:19.495
We will get the pastor!

42:19.578 --> 42:21.997
Humans cannot harm the pastor!

42:22.081 --> 42:23.415
You, Judas, must die!

43:01.370 --> 43:02.413
Don't move!

43:03.706 --> 43:05.666
-Don't shoot!
-Put your guns down!

43:45.789 --> 43:48.083
<i> Enemies spotted</i>
<i>fleeing the compound.</i>

43:48.167 --> 43:50.336
<i>The target is among them. I'll open fire.</i>

43:50.419 --> 43:52.838
Careful, we need the target alive.

43:52.921 --> 43:53.964
Let's go!

45:47.411 --> 45:48.704
Shit.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.000
<i>The target's attempting</i>
<i>to escape on a boat.</i>

46:08.265 --> 46:09.475
Over there!

46:09.558 --> 46:11.560
Over there! There! There! Hey, stop! Stop!

46:27.534 --> 46:28.744
Fuck!

46:55.312 --> 46:56.939
Ah! Oh shit!

47:17.626 --> 47:18.544
Ah!

47:21.755 --> 47:22.631
Shit!

47:28.053 --> 47:29.596
Hey!

47:39.231 --> 47:40.148
Come here!

47:46.029 --> 47:47.865
Die, you son of a bitch!

47:55.956 --> 47:57.124
You asshole!

48:45.589 --> 48:47.174
Ah!

49:00.020 --> 49:01.980
Son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

49:03.815 --> 49:05.400
You are Satan.

49:06.443 --> 49:09.196
In the name of… God!

49:23.418 --> 49:24.628
You bastard!

49:24.711 --> 49:27.506
Eungsoo's dead, and my life is ruined!

49:31.718 --> 49:33.220
Stop!

49:34.346 --> 49:37.265
DEA! Get your hands in the air!

49:37.849 --> 49:38.684
Now!

49:42.813 --> 49:46.358
No! He's killing me!

49:48.485 --> 49:49.695
Get up!

49:49.778 --> 49:53.991
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Please! Please!

49:54.074 --> 49:55.033
Don't shoot!

49:56.326 --> 49:57.160
Stop!

49:57.661 --> 50:00.998
I… I'm a pastor! I'm a pastor!
I… I don't know anything.

50:01.081 --> 50:03.208
-Down on the ground!
-Okay! Okay! Okay!

50:03.291 --> 50:05.752
-Down, now!
-Okay, okay, okay. Don't shoot!

50:05.836 --> 50:08.296
I'm a pastor! I'm a pastor!

50:08.380 --> 50:12.759
I'm a pastor! Please!
I'm a pastor! I'm a pastor!

50:17.973 --> 50:20.017
Mr. Yohan, I'm with the NIS.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.436
Along with the DEA,
and on behalf of us both,

50:23.145 --> 50:26.982
I'm placing you under arrest for murder
and drug trafficking.

50:28.483 --> 50:29.693
Shit.

50:30.402 --> 50:32.362
You have the right
to an attorney

50:32.863 --> 50:34.865
and the right to remain silent.

50:39.786 --> 50:40.704
You…

50:48.295 --> 50:50.005
Shit.

51:11.109 --> 51:13.445
Once we are done
with the Cali Cartel investigation,

51:13.528 --> 51:15.322
I'll send Jeon to Korea right away.

51:15.405 --> 51:16.281
Great.

51:17.032 --> 51:18.992
I wanna visit you in Virginia someday.

51:19.868 --> 51:20.702
Thank you.

51:21.495 --> 51:22.329
Bring some scotch.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.874
Sure. You got it.

51:31.379 --> 51:32.547
Agent Kim.

51:33.298 --> 51:35.008
It couldn't have been easy.

51:35.509 --> 51:37.677
Just doing my job, sir.

51:43.141 --> 51:44.142
Hey.

51:46.436 --> 51:49.898
Would you mind having a look
at my mom's car for me?

51:51.525 --> 51:52.400
What's the model?

51:53.276 --> 51:54.236
Galloper.

51:56.363 --> 51:57.364
Bring it by.

51:59.783 --> 52:01.618
But let's get back home first.

52:11.503 --> 52:12.546
Mr. Kang.

52:14.422 --> 52:16.258
We appreciate your work.

52:18.176 --> 52:19.177
Yeah.

52:19.845 --> 52:21.012
Back at you.

52:45.412 --> 52:48.290
EDEN SNACKS

52:57.382 --> 52:58.884
All right, here's your <i>gimbap.</i>

52:58.967 --> 53:00.051
-Ah, great.
-Thanks so much.

53:00.135 --> 53:01.553
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

53:03.597 --> 53:04.556
All done?

53:05.098 --> 53:07.100
How much more do you have to do?

53:12.230 --> 53:13.899
Have you finished all this?

53:14.524 --> 53:16.902
What about this?
This one's still blank.

53:17.652 --> 53:18.653
This one too.

53:19.821 --> 53:20.655
Okay?

53:21.531 --> 53:23.074
-And that one.
-Dad?

53:38.590 --> 53:40.091
Daddy's back!

53:41.301 --> 53:42.594
It's so…

53:59.986 --> 54:01.446
Took you long enough.

54:03.907 --> 54:04.824
Sorry.

54:10.997 --> 54:13.250
Wait. You got prettier.

54:13.333 --> 54:14.960
I mean…

54:16.211 --> 54:18.338
Did you get some work done?

54:20.298 --> 54:22.550
Why did you get so ugly?

54:23.176 --> 54:25.387
I only married you for your face.

54:28.265 --> 54:30.183
You going away?

54:31.810 --> 54:33.812
No, no way.

54:35.146 --> 54:36.189
Never again.

54:50.578 --> 54:53.498
SIX MONTHS LATER

54:54.291 --> 54:55.709
JACKSON CAR CENTER

54:58.128 --> 54:59.045
My turn.

55:02.632 --> 55:04.301
Wow, it looks so authentic.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.512
Looks like the real thing.

55:07.595 --> 55:09.180
Of course it does.

55:09.264 --> 55:11.182
All of the parts,
including the tension rod,

55:11.266 --> 55:13.810
only affect the cushioning
of the lower body of the vehicle.

55:13.893 --> 55:17.272
Western and Korean cars
have different shells on top.

55:17.355 --> 55:20.608
So we just put a brand-new body
on the guts.

55:20.692 --> 55:22.694
Sure am glad I came to you.

55:22.777 --> 55:25.447
Ah, you made a good choice.

55:25.530 --> 55:29.284
You saved money, and also
you bought Korean-made products.

55:29.784 --> 55:32.203
Patriotic.

55:42.922 --> 55:43.923
This guy.

55:46.968 --> 55:49.888
I cannot believe
this model's still running.

55:51.973 --> 55:53.558
You scrapping it?

55:54.392 --> 55:55.226
No.

55:56.478 --> 55:58.897
There's been some reports
that a garage out here in Dongducheon

55:58.980 --> 56:00.523
has been ripping people off.

56:01.107 --> 56:02.067
Huh.

56:02.692 --> 56:03.610
From who?

56:04.110 --> 56:07.238
And you never even paid me
the rest of the money you promised.

56:08.281 --> 56:10.033
I should report you for that, you know?

56:12.660 --> 56:14.329
Where is my money, anyway?

56:14.913 --> 56:17.207
That's part of the reason I came by.

56:26.841 --> 56:28.802
We had to take it up the chain.

56:29.636 --> 56:32.138
While they weren't able to pay cash,

56:32.222 --> 56:34.182
I figured out an even better solution.

56:36.226 --> 56:38.978
We'll let you take over
two of our karaoke bars.

56:39.062 --> 56:41.481
This way, it works out
to several times more than I promised

56:41.564 --> 56:43.274
over just a couple of years.

56:50.448 --> 56:51.282
No.

56:51.950 --> 56:52.784
Forget it.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.662
I left all of that behind.

56:56.955 --> 57:00.041
You do understand you get them for free?
Absolutely no catch.

57:01.292 --> 57:03.294
There's always a catch, you know?

57:03.837 --> 57:06.923
Besides, I only want to work
for myself now.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.226
Let me ask you a question, Choi.

57:19.853 --> 57:23.231
When can I let people know
that I worked with the NIS?

57:25.150 --> 57:26.526
Ooh boy.

57:26.609 --> 57:29.320
Well, you can tell people
anything you want,

57:29.904 --> 57:31.906
but we can never
acknowledge you officially.

57:32.615 --> 57:33.450
Why?

57:35.577 --> 57:36.911
Well,

57:37.412 --> 57:38.288
you know…

57:41.791 --> 57:45.712
After all the things that went down,
this story's about all I have.

57:47.046 --> 57:52.051
I want my son and my daughter to be,
well, at least proud of their dad.

57:52.135 --> 57:54.137
Working with the NIS would make me cool.

57:58.933 --> 58:00.727
I went to see Jeon, you know?

58:02.520 --> 58:05.023
Yeah, he's appealing his sentence,
isn't he?

58:05.607 --> 58:06.524
He is.

58:07.817 --> 58:10.278
He wanted me to pass along
a message to you.

58:10.361 --> 58:12.363
He said you have something of his.

58:12.447 --> 58:13.281
What?

58:14.282 --> 58:16.201
Some autographed baseball, I think.

58:16.826 --> 58:17.660
Huh?

58:20.455 --> 58:22.165
Hyungju.

58:23.541 --> 58:24.626
Would you bring me the ball?

58:30.715 --> 58:32.967
This baseball with the fake autograph?

58:33.676 --> 58:37.138
Well, I'm no expert,
but the pastor told me this ball

58:37.222 --> 58:40.016
is the only real thing
that he's ever owned.

58:41.893 --> 58:43.394
This is authentic?

58:46.731 --> 58:49.442
That's what he said,
but I have no idea really.

58:50.693 --> 58:51.903
Who knows?
