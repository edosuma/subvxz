00:09.226 --> 00:11.228
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.228 --> 00:12.534
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.534 --> 00:15.145
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:15.145 --> 00:16.973
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:16.973 --> 00:19.889
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:19.889 --> 00:21.717
<i>These are their stories.</i>

01:01.626 --> 01:03.585
I'm sorry.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.507
That's bold,

01:12.507 --> 01:14.726
killing somebody
with all these windows here.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.641
This time of night,
this neighborhood,

01:16.641 --> 01:19.166
everybody's asleep
by the 10:00 news.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.169
Bet you anything
not a single witness.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.736
I'll take that bet.
What you got?

01:24.736 --> 01:27.261
DOA is Alexander Lockett,
owner of the house.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.524
911 call came in at 12:09
from a neighbor,

01:29.524 --> 01:31.221
who heard multiple gunshots.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.876
- Any witnesses?
- None so far.

01:33.876 --> 01:37.575
CSU found a wallet and cell
phone inside his suit jacket.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.273
Anything missing
from inside the house?

01:39.273 --> 01:42.145
Not that we could tell.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.929
It doesn't seem
like a robbery.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.149
Unless the killer was looking
for something specific.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.585
What do you got?

01:47.585 --> 01:49.761
Shot three times in the chest
at close range.

01:49.761 --> 01:52.808
Shell casings are here,
9-millimeter.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.592
Alexander Lockett,

01:54.592 --> 01:57.421
chief revenue officer
at Finley Madison.

01:57.421 --> 01:58.727
The department store.

01:58.727 --> 02:01.251
I was just there
buying a present for my wife.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.600
It's our anniversary.
- Oh, yeah?

02:02.600 --> 02:05.299
- Place was a ghost town.
- Yeah.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.301
Brick and mortar retail
is dead.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.130
No offense.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.961
Alexander Lockett
was divorced.

02:58.961 --> 03:00.658
Got a grown daughter, Melinda.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.487
She's living in Ohio.
She's en route.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.663
What about the ex-wife?

03:05.663 --> 03:07.535
They split up a decade ago.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.102
She's a diplomat
posted in Australia.

03:10.102 --> 03:12.409
Confirmed
with the state department

03:12.409 --> 03:14.455
that she hasn't been back home
all year.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.805
The guy was a boy scout,
former colonel in the army.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.110
Served in Iraq.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.677
Moved into the private sector
ten years ago.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.113
Hit it big
as an executive

03:21.113 --> 03:23.899
at a mall brand department
store, Finley Madison.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.596
Neighbors all say
he was a stand-up guy.

03:25.596 --> 03:28.208
Lived alone, but he was
friendly and respectful.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.253
Well,
somebody wanted him dead.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.342
I mean,
a swanky place like that,

03:32.342 --> 03:34.562
he must have had
Fort Knox-level security.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.216
He's got cameras
covering the backyard,

03:36.216 --> 03:39.480
but the security system's log
shows the footage was deleted

03:39.480 --> 03:42.004
via the app on Lockett's phone
at 12:10 a.m.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.267
Right after his neighbors
heard shots.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.703
Do we have anything
on the gun?

03:45.703 --> 03:47.575
We're canvassing the area
for the murder weapon,

03:47.575 --> 03:50.491
and we're also looking
for any video we can find.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.797
You know, that guy
is awfully dressed up

03:52.797 --> 03:54.973
for a midnight smoke
under the stars.

03:54.973 --> 03:58.150
I wonder where he came from,
who he was with.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.022
Financial workup
just came in.

04:00.022 --> 04:02.851
Shows where Lockett's
credit card was last used.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.420
<i>Alex is a regular.</i>

04:06.420 --> 04:08.335
Great guy.
Really generous tipper.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.989
He lives--

04:10.989 --> 04:12.556
lived in the neighborhood.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.645
Do you know who he was here
with that night?

04:14.645 --> 04:17.474
Yeah, the woman
he's been seeing for a while.

04:17.474 --> 04:20.216
- What time did they leave?
- Which one?

04:20.216 --> 04:22.087
They left at different times.

04:22.087 --> 04:24.002
Different times?

04:24.002 --> 04:27.310
None of my business,
but something was off.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.964
They're usually
very lovey-dovey,

04:28.964 --> 04:30.400
but a place like this,
you can't help

04:30.400 --> 04:32.576
but notice raised voices.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.579
They definitely argued
until she ran out.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.015
And Lockett didn't go
after her?

04:37.015 --> 04:40.541
No, he sulked over
his whiskey and then paid.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.804
This girlfriend,
you got a name?

04:42.804 --> 04:45.633
Yeah, she's the one
that made the reservation.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.724
I can't believe he's dead.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.292
Who would do something
like that to him?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.597
Can I ask you

04:53.597 --> 04:56.296
how long you two had
been seeing each other?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.342
Four months,
but it felt like longer.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.692
We were making
life plans together.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.304
He was gonna introduce me
to his daughter.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.609
Does Melinda know?

05:05.609 --> 05:08.220
She's been notified.
Yes, ma'am.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.483
I understand
you and Alexander

05:09.483 --> 05:10.440
got in a fight
last night.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.616
We had an argument.

05:12.616 --> 05:15.184
Disagreement in a relationship
is normal.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.099
It's healthy even.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.187
Well, I guess that depends

05:18.187 --> 05:20.015
on what the argument
is about, right?

05:20.015 --> 05:23.975
Well, Alex had been
under a lot of stress lately,

05:23.975 --> 05:27.805
and last night, he was
in a particularly dark mood.

05:27.805 --> 05:32.070
But when I asked him what was
wrong, he refused to tell me.

05:32.070 --> 05:35.509
I chose to remove myself
from the situation.

05:35.509 --> 05:38.599
Obviously,
I regret that now.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.035
I know you said
that Mr. Lockett

05:40.035 --> 05:42.603
didn't share his feelings
with you last night,

05:42.603 --> 05:46.433
but do you have a theory
about what was bothering him?

05:46.433 --> 05:49.479
Not specifically,
but it--

05:49.479 --> 05:52.047
it definitely had something
to do with work.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.399
<i>Employees all loved Alex.</i>

05:56.399 --> 05:58.401
He was tough but fair.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.708
And he cared,
like, for real.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.666
He worked hard
to keep people employed,

06:02.666 --> 06:05.060
but not his fault
the company is failing.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.410
So you don't know anybody who
would have wanted to hurt him?

06:07.410 --> 06:09.586
Well, I didn't say that.

06:09.586 --> 06:12.981
Yesterday, Sonya Chakrabarti,
the CFO, ripped him--

06:12.981 --> 06:14.939
had words with him.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.812
- What kind of words?
- Excessively harsh ones.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.597
It was more like
a verbal MMA fight, really.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.382
Here's Alex's office.

06:25.254 --> 06:28.562
Looks more than verbal to me.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.694
Before Sonya stormed out
of his office,

06:30.694 --> 06:33.305
she grabbed a glass paperweight
and threw it at him.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.698
Just missed his head.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.787
What do you think
she was so mad about?

06:36.787 --> 06:39.311
I think
they were having an affair.

06:39.311 --> 06:42.010
- Why do you say that?
- She kept yelling at him.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.708
"I'm sick of all the secrets,"
or something like that.

06:44.708 --> 06:49.234
This Sonya Chakrabarti,
where's her office?

06:49.234 --> 06:53.021
Second door on the right, but
she's working from home today.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.598
- Sonia Chakrabarti.
- Where are you headed?

07:04.598 --> 07:07.644
I have a plane to catch.
What's this all about?

07:07.644 --> 07:08.732
We need to ask you
some questions

07:08.732 --> 07:11.082
about Alexander Lockett.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.128
I'm not saying a word
without my lawyer.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.608
In that case,

07:14.608 --> 07:17.045
it looks like
you're missing your flight.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.486
I assure you,
I was not having an affair

07:23.486 --> 07:24.966
with Alex Lockett.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.185
Yeah, we saw the crater
you left in his office wall.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.448
You've got a good arm.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.537
You were tired
of being his little secret.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.974
You wanted to go public,
but he broke it off.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.541
That would make anybody angry.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.413
Why must men always
reduce a woman down to sex?

07:37.413 --> 07:39.241
My client is
the chief financial officer

07:39.241 --> 07:41.939
of a Fortune 500 company, Detective.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.507
A position
I take very seriously.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.596
So why the yelling match?

07:46.596 --> 07:47.771
Fraud.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.952
I discovered
that Alex had secured

07:54.952 --> 07:57.520
a $300 million bank loan
from the company.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.262
As CFO, isn't that something
you should have handled?

08:00.262 --> 08:03.265
Exactly.
That's why I was upset.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.006
He went behind my back.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.529
Any reason why?

08:06.529 --> 08:09.358
He inflated the company's
earning projections,

08:09.358 --> 08:11.142
wanted to make sure
the bank said yes.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.144
So you were upset?

08:13.144 --> 08:15.843
Upset enough
to throw a heavy object at him?

08:15.843 --> 08:17.366
That's correct.

08:18.628 --> 08:21.979
But I didn't kill him,
for God's sake.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.199
But the truth is,

08:24.199 --> 08:26.114
I really liked Alex.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.508
He was a good man.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.422
Just in over his head,
if you ask me.

08:30.422 --> 08:31.946
Meaning what?

08:31.946 --> 08:34.775
Meaning he wasn't cut out
for the corporate world.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.299
Didn't like all the politics.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.562
Just did what the CEO told him.

08:43.653 --> 08:46.264
Why on Earth
would I murder Alex?

08:46.264 --> 08:48.876
To cover up financial crimes
that you made him commit.

08:48.876 --> 08:53.794
Any exposure could lead
to an SEC investigation, fines.

08:53.794 --> 08:54.838
Maybe you're looking
at jail time.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.144
Guy like you,
you don't want.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.841
Except there was no crime.

08:57.841 --> 09:00.540
We found video of you
on Alexander's block

09:00.540 --> 09:02.411
less than an hour
before he ended up

09:02.411 --> 09:03.847
with three bullets
in his chest.

09:03.847 --> 09:06.633
You just couldn't be sure
he'd keep his mouth shut.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.896
I went there
to calm Alex down,

09:08.896 --> 09:11.986
assure him Sonya's hysterics
had no merit.

09:11.986 --> 09:15.337
You scammed $300 million
with made up numbers.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.643
You call that no merit?

09:16.643 --> 09:20.603
Projections are
made up numbers by definition.

09:20.603 --> 09:23.388
What we did
was perfectly legal.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.869
There's no law
against being optimistic.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.958
So why cut your CFO out
of the loop?

09:27.958 --> 09:30.831
Because she has
no financial imagination.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.964
So I told Alex to handle it.
Simple as that.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.836
So Alexander
had the imagination.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.794
No, but he followed orders.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.101
He was former army,
a good soldier.

09:40.101 --> 09:42.190
I knew I could count on him.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.627
Alex was alive and well

09:44.627 --> 09:46.934
when I left his house
a little before midnight.

09:46.934 --> 09:49.023
Feel free to verify
with my driver.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.982
Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,

09:51.982 --> 09:53.375
I have a company to run.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.552
It's Dixon.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.815
We need to get back
to the crime scene.

09:58.815 --> 09:59.990
What's up?

09:59.990 --> 10:02.645
Alexander's daughter
just got there.

10:02.645 --> 10:05.430
She says something is missing
from his brownstone.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.693
I'm not the kind of person

10:06.693 --> 10:08.042
who can just sit around
and wallow,

10:08.042 --> 10:09.739
so I figured
I'd start putting together

10:09.739 --> 10:12.655
the outfit my father
would want to be buried in.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.657
That's when I discovered
it was missing.

10:14.657 --> 10:15.963
You're saying it was a medal.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.139
A Distinguished
Service Cross.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.576
That's one of the highest
commendations there is.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.665
It was in honor
of his service

10:22.665 --> 10:26.321
as the base commander
of Camp Victory in Iraq.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.583
It meant a lot to him.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.237
And you're sure
it was stolen?

10:29.237 --> 10:32.762
Yes, it was framed
on the wall right here.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.591
Nothing else is missing
or out of place?

10:35.591 --> 10:38.202
No, just that.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.464
Do you know of any reason

10:39.464 --> 10:40.901
why someone would want
to take that?

10:40.901 --> 10:43.817
No, it wasn't worth
a lot of money or anything.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.775
It doesn't make any sense.

10:50.388 --> 10:53.653
So if the medal was stolen
by whoever murdered Lockett,

10:53.653 --> 10:56.438
that must mean his death
is somehow related

10:56.438 --> 10:57.744
to his military career.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.876
Yeah,
and we think we know how.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.617
Yee went
through traffic cam videos

11:01.617 --> 11:02.749
from Lockett's neighborhood

11:02.749 --> 11:04.576
from around the time
of the murder.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.709
Now, she cross-referenced
veteran records

11:06.709 --> 11:09.364
with vehicle registration
records and got a hit.

11:09.364 --> 11:12.933
A brown and tan truck
shows up multiple times

11:12.933 --> 11:15.805
in the 20-minute window
before Lockett was shot.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.546
Just circling the block

11:17.546 --> 11:19.635
while the CEO is inside
with Lockett.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.593
It's registered
to a Shane Risner.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.770
36. Single.
Spotty employment records.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.468
Spotty because Risner
was dishonorably discharged

11:26.468 --> 11:28.296
from the army
back in 2008.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.340
And guess what?

11:29.340 --> 11:30.951
The court martial was signed

11:30.951 --> 11:35.390
by none other than U.S. Army
Colonel Alexander T. Lockett.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.784
So our vic DD'ed this guy?

11:37.784 --> 11:40.221
And that stain
follows you around for life.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.788
You lose your VA benefits,

11:41.788 --> 11:44.268
don't qualify for unemployment,
can't get a loan.

11:44.268 --> 11:47.837
So this Shane Risner
is just looking for revenge.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.099
Mm.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.579
Let's go find him.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.196
Police.
Open up.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.371
What's going on?

12:00.371 --> 12:01.851
We'll looking
for Shane Risner.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.157
You're a little late.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.768
Why is that? He
take off somewhere?

12:05.768 --> 12:08.945
No, he died three days ago.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.433
Shane Risner died
by suicide

12:18.433 --> 12:19.695
a day before
Lockett was murdered.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.175
The system hadn't updated yet.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.219
That's why we didn't know.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.874
He OD'd on meds
and left a note.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.876
So who the hell is
driving around in the truck?

12:26.876 --> 12:28.225
Don't know.
The traffic cams

12:28.225 --> 12:30.750
didn't get a clear shot
of the driver's face.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.708
I'm guessing it was
somebody close to Risner,

12:32.708 --> 12:34.623
who blamed Lockett
for the suicide.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.191
And took Risner's truck
to go and kill him?

12:37.191 --> 12:39.149
Well, how else do you
explain the coincidence?

12:39.149 --> 12:40.498
I've got something.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.109
I was able to access
the anti-theft device

12:42.109 --> 12:43.675
on Risner's truck.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.069
It's on the move, heading east
onto 80 outside Newark.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.071
All right, I'll contact
Jersey State Police

12:48.071 --> 12:51.248
and Essex County
Sheriff's Department.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.870
Target vehicle has parked

13:03.870 --> 13:06.786
in the Saint Teresa's
parking lot on 44th.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.877
Hold on.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.356
I know that guy.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.749
That's
Shane Risner's associate.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.230
They served together in Iraq.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.101
Vincent Martinez.

13:18.101 --> 13:21.017
It's got to be him.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.585
This has got to be
Risner's funeral.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.674
Oh, we need to grab him now.
- No. Hey, Frank.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.241
Frank, no, no, no.

13:27.241 --> 13:30.418
Look, you and I can go in there
and keep eyes on Martinez,

13:30.418 --> 13:32.768
and we can wait for a discreet
moment to approach after.

13:32.768 --> 13:33.987
- Discreet?
- Yeah.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.336
This guy is
murder suspect number one.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.772
We don't know if he's armed,

13:36.772 --> 13:37.860
whether he's going in there
to shoot up the place.

13:37.860 --> 13:38.774
He's not gonna
shoot up the place.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.167
It's a veteran's funeral.

13:40.167 --> 13:43.387
- So?
- So?

13:43.387 --> 13:44.954
Frank, my brother's
in the military.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.087
My father was.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.479
These funerals matter,

13:48.479 --> 13:52.701
so let's just try
to show them some respect, huh?

13:52.701 --> 13:54.834
- Discreet.
- Discreet.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.716
Damn it.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.501
NYPD! Stop!

15:15.305 --> 15:17.220
Sergeant Martinez,
you're under arrest

15:17.220 --> 15:19.657
for the murder
of Alexander Lockett.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.314
Discreet enough for you?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.493
I'm telling you,
I had nothing to do

15:29.493 --> 15:30.581
with Colonel Lockett's death.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.409
Shane Risner's father said

15:32.409 --> 15:34.107
you bought Shane's truck
from him.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.412
The same truck
that was parked

15:35.412 --> 15:36.892
outside the colonel's house

15:36.892 --> 15:38.328
the night he was killed--

15:38.328 --> 15:40.026
your former commanding officer.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.463
Sergeant,
you're looking at murder two.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.900
25 to life.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.120
I'm telling you,
it wasn't me.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.991
The night before last,
I was at a bar

15:48.991 --> 15:50.471
with some buddies
from the unit.

15:50.471 --> 15:51.951
Millie's.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.865
We used to go there with Shane

15:53.865 --> 15:55.084
before his lungs
were so shredded

15:55.084 --> 15:57.652
he could barely
leave the house.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.394
Shane was sick?

16:00.394 --> 16:02.265
He was dying.

16:02.265 --> 16:05.312
Pulmonary fibrosis.

16:05.312 --> 16:08.271
Suicide was just a shortcut,

16:08.271 --> 16:11.013
but you can't put that
in the obit.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.629
You guys were in Iraq.

16:18.629 --> 16:21.458
Burn pits.

16:21.458 --> 16:25.158
Army burned
all kinds of nasty-ass stuff.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.421
And we'd just
breathe in the smoke,

16:27.421 --> 16:29.640
day in and day out.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.339
And now,
we all got problems.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.514
You blame Lockett for that?

16:33.514 --> 16:36.125
I don't blame anybody
for anything.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.910
And I was at the bar
till closing.

16:38.910 --> 16:42.131
Look, I know you guys
got a raw deal over there,

16:42.131 --> 16:44.655
but, Sergeant,
it was your truck.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.354
If you weren't driving,
who was?

16:49.008 --> 16:51.140
I don't know anything
about that.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.276
CSU found blood in the truck.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.626
It's a DNA match.
Alexander Lockett.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.063
Well, that explains
why Martinez ran.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.412
No, his alibi is airtight.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.805
He was at that bar, Millie's,
all night.

17:03.805 --> 17:04.849
There's video of him.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.329
He couldn't have
killed Lockett.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.591
I bet he knows who did.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.158
I've been running
the prints CSU lifted

17:09.158 --> 17:10.812
from the interior
of the truck.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.422
Three latents
from the driver's side door

17:12.422 --> 17:14.033
belonged to a Luke Fallon.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.948
He served in the same unit
as Risner and Martinez.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.038
At the funeral, there was
a picture at the entrance.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.126
There was three guys:

17:20.126 --> 17:23.433
Martinez, Risner,
and the third guy.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.348
That's the third guy.

17:25.348 --> 17:29.178
Fallon has a registered gun,
a SIG Sauer P365.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.179
That's a 9-mil.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.660
Same caliber used
to kill Lockett.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.314
All right.
Let's bring this guy in.

17:34.314 --> 17:36.664
His address is in New Jersey,
but his Metro card

17:36.664 --> 17:40.189
was just used 19 minutes ago to
board a Q39 bus in Sunnyside.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.322
Queens.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.193
Where's he going?

17:44.193 --> 17:45.455
I think I know.

17:48.850 --> 17:52.071
Luke Fallon, NYPD.
Show me your hands.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.771
Show me your hands!

17:56.771 --> 17:59.034
Keep them up.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.341
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
put that hand up.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.951
Put that hand up.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.877
What do you know?

18:15.877 --> 18:18.009
Lockett's medal.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.020
I just got a call

18:29.020 --> 18:31.980
from the Office of
the Undersecretary of Defense

18:31.980 --> 18:33.895
looking for a status report

18:33.895 --> 18:37.681
on the case against Colonel
Alexander Lockett's killer.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.902
That's an impressive level
of investment.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.296
Lockett retired
almost a decade ago.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.732
Active service or not,

18:44.732 --> 18:48.301
the army notices
when a decorated war hero

18:48.301 --> 18:50.303
is brutally murdered.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.261
What did you tell them?

18:52.261 --> 18:54.872
That justice will be served.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.353
I assume you agree.
- I do.

18:57.353 --> 19:00.661
Even though you can't place
Fallon at the murder scene.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.706
I can come close.

19:02.706 --> 19:05.013
I can put him in the truck,

19:05.013 --> 19:07.450
where Lockett's blood was found
on the night of the murder.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.538
How?

19:08.538 --> 19:10.453
I'm gonna call
Vincent Martinez.

19:10.453 --> 19:13.413
I thought Martinez wasn't
interested in cooperating.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.023
He wasn't

19:15.023 --> 19:17.939
until I threatened to charge
him with accomplice to murder.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.986
He'll be a hostile witness.

19:26.426 --> 19:30.038
Mr. Martinez,
how do you know the defendant?

19:30.038 --> 19:32.736
We were stationed together
in Iraq.

19:32.736 --> 19:36.000
Camp Victory,
just outside Baghdad.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.090
We served on the same unit
from 2006 to 2008.

19:39.090 --> 19:42.006
And did you see the defendant
on September 27,

19:42.006 --> 19:45.358
the day that Alexander Lockett
was murdered?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.624
I don't know.

19:50.624 --> 19:53.627
You don't know
if you saw him or not?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.632
I don't know.

19:58.632 --> 20:02.679
Yeah,
I guess I saw him that day.

20:02.679 --> 20:05.247
And did Luke Fallon ask

20:05.247 --> 20:07.293
if he could borrow your truck
that evening?

20:13.603 --> 20:16.040
Mr. Martinez?

20:17.825 --> 20:19.653
I have nothing to say.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.308
Answer the question,
Mr. Martinez.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.439
I'm sorry, but no.

20:23.439 --> 20:24.788
Answer the question,

20:24.788 --> 20:26.312
or you'll be held
in contempt of court.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.052
- Mr. Martinez--
- You do what you have to do.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.619
- Please, Your Honor--
- I'm serious, Mr. Martinez.

20:29.619 --> 20:30.751
And so am I.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.666
Then I find you in contempt.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.015
Officer, take charge.

20:47.507 --> 20:51.685
So what exactly
are we hoping to find here?

20:51.685 --> 20:53.513
Anything
to salvage this case.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.731
Oh, just that?

20:54.731 --> 20:57.952
If we could find video
or a witness

20:57.952 --> 21:01.216
that saw Luke Fallon
in Risner's truck that night,

21:01.216 --> 21:03.174
then we could at least
place him at Lockett's house

21:03.174 --> 21:04.872
when the murder occurred.
- We tried.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.787
The only video
that we could recover,

21:06.787 --> 21:10.312
other than the traffic cam that
was near Lockett's brownstone,

21:10.312 --> 21:14.142
was off of an exit of Garden
State Parkway at 12:58 a.m.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.536
But the visor was down, so we
couldn't see who was driving.

21:16.536 --> 21:19.582
Well, that's less
than an hour after the murder.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.280
Is the exit the truck got off

21:21.280 --> 21:22.890
the one closest
to Fallon's house?

21:22.890 --> 21:25.327
No, it's actually not.
It's four earlier.

21:25.327 --> 21:28.417
That means, presuming
Fallon was the one driving,

21:28.417 --> 21:32.856
that he didn't go directly home
after killing Lockett.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.423
Why?
- Our theory:

21:34.423 --> 21:36.207
that's when he was
ditching the murder weapon.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.122
It's close to the hospital
where Shane Risner

21:38.122 --> 21:40.342
was getting treatment
for his pulmonary fibrosis.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.127
His father told us
that Fallon and Martinez

21:43.127 --> 21:45.216
took turns taking him
to his appointments

21:45.216 --> 21:48.176
because he wasn't feeling well
enough to drive himself, so...

21:48.176 --> 21:50.309
When I was prepping
Vincent Martinez,

21:50.309 --> 21:53.747
he told me
that sometimes after treatments

21:53.747 --> 21:57.011
Risner asked to go
to a park in the area.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.754
Branch Brook Park?

22:00.754 --> 22:02.886
That's it.
That's the one.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.889
He said Risner
had difficulty breathing,

22:05.889 --> 22:08.109
so he liked
to sit on a bench

22:08.109 --> 22:13.288
and enjoy the fresh air
coming off the lake.

22:19.294 --> 22:22.253
Detective, were you able
to run a ballistics test

22:22.253 --> 22:24.212
on the gun you recovered
from the lake?

22:24.212 --> 22:25.344
We were.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.649
The striations
on the bullets retrieved

22:26.649 --> 22:29.652
from Colonel Lockett's body
matched the rifling

22:29.652 --> 22:31.175
and characteristics
of that firearm.

22:31.175 --> 22:33.526
Confirming
that this is the gun

22:33.526 --> 22:36.267
that was used
to murder Alexander Lockett?

22:36.267 --> 22:37.530
That's correct.

22:37.530 --> 22:38.879
And is the gun registered?

22:38.879 --> 22:41.403
Yes.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.537
To Luke Fallon,
the defendant.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.539
Thank you, Detective.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.674
We have no questions
for this witness at this time.

22:51.674 --> 22:54.285
Detective Shaw,
you may step down.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.505
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Prosecution rests.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.600
Your Honor, the defense
would like to inform the court

23:04.600 --> 23:06.820
that we're filing a motion
to change our plea.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.082
To what?

23:08.082 --> 23:11.259
Not guilty
by reason of insanity.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.443
Fallon now admits
he shot Alexander Lockett,

23:21.443 --> 23:23.532
just claims
he wasn't in his right mind

23:23.532 --> 23:25.099
when it actually happened.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.710
They're going with
a temporary insanity defense.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.320
A variation thereof.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.106
It turns out
Fallon has a glioblastoma,

23:32.106 --> 23:34.238
a brain tumor
on his frontal lobe.

23:34.238 --> 23:37.111
The defense is arguing it
impacted his impulse control.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.895
How did we not know
about this?

23:38.895 --> 23:41.637
It was diagnosed
only a week before the murder.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.378
He hadn't
received treatment yet,

23:43.378 --> 23:46.990
and by their account,
hadn't told anyone,

23:46.990 --> 23:48.949
including his attorney,
until now.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.864
That's strains credulity.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.474
Judge thought so too

23:52.474 --> 23:54.694
but ultimately accepted
their change of plea.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.087
Studies
have linked glioblastomas

23:57.087 --> 24:00.177
specifically to toxic exposure
from burn pits.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.179
So from Fallon's perspective,

24:02.179 --> 24:05.618
Colonel Lockett
was not only responsible

24:05.618 --> 24:09.012
for his best friend's suicide
but also for his own diagnosis.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.362
That only strengthens
his motive to kill Lockett.

24:11.362 --> 24:14.409
But the defense
has a neurooncologist

24:14.409 --> 24:17.543
who will testify that the tumor
is to blame for the murder

24:17.543 --> 24:21.242
and impaired Fallon's ability
to control his actions

24:21.242 --> 24:23.374
and distinguish
right from wrong in the moment.

24:23.374 --> 24:27.378
That's not true,
but it's good strategy.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.903
Allows them
to introduce the burn pits

24:29.903 --> 24:32.166
and the tragic aftermath.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.037
Paint the defendant
as the victim.

24:34.037 --> 24:36.431
In a way, he is.

24:36.431 --> 24:40.261
Whether Lockett knew the
burn pits were harmful or not,

24:40.261 --> 24:42.524
he refused to get rid of them.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.440
Now these guys are sick.
I mean, real sick.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.747
If I'm on the jury,
I wouldn't convict

24:47.747 --> 24:51.751
the soldier who got a
brain tumor he didn't deserve.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.579
You saying
we should offer a plea?

24:53.579 --> 24:57.713
No, absolutely not.
This murder was premeditated.

24:57.713 --> 25:00.020
I agree.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.065
But Ms. Maroun's right.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.198
The jury is gonna eat this up,

25:04.198 --> 25:08.507
so make it clear to them
what the defense is doing,

25:08.507 --> 25:10.726
using
the defendant's brain tumor

25:10.726 --> 25:14.817
to emotionally manipulate them
into ignoring the facts.

25:19.996 --> 25:21.389
<i>Glioblastoma is one</i>

25:21.389 --> 25:24.479
of the most aggressive types
of brain cancer.

25:24.479 --> 25:27.308
Unfortunately,
it's almost always terminal.

25:27.308 --> 25:30.877
And Dr. Simon, do we know
what causes glioblastoma?

25:30.877 --> 25:32.966
Likely
a combination of factors.

25:32.966 --> 25:36.665
Genetic predisposition,
exposure to carcinogens.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.407
Exposure like
that inflicted upon soldiers

25:39.407 --> 25:42.932
forced to inhale toxic smoke
from burn pits?

25:42.932 --> 25:46.501
Yes, studies have shown
a clear correlation.

25:46.501 --> 25:49.591
Glioblastoma incidence
is very low among cancer types,

25:49.591 --> 25:51.811
about 1 per 10,000 cases.

25:51.811 --> 25:54.509
But for those who spent
significant amounts of time

25:54.509 --> 25:57.860
around the burn pits,
it's astronomically higher.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.862
During your evaluation
of Luke Fallon,

25:59.862 --> 26:01.995
what did he tell you happened

26:01.995 --> 26:04.954
on the evening
of September 27?

26:04.954 --> 26:07.609
He reported
an upsetting conversation

26:07.609 --> 26:09.350
with his former base commander

26:09.350 --> 26:11.874
and then experiencing
a total blackout.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.094
When he emerged,
he had no memory

26:14.094 --> 26:16.313
of pulling out
or firing his weapon.

26:16.313 --> 26:19.316
Dr. Simon,
in your professional opinion,

26:19.316 --> 26:22.363
was Luke Fallon's tumor responsible

26:22.363 --> 26:24.234
for his shooting
Alexander Lockett?

26:24.234 --> 26:27.934
Yes, I believe Mr. Fallon
had no ability to control

26:27.934 --> 26:31.851
or understand the consequences
of his actions at the time.

26:31.851 --> 26:35.115
Thank you.
No further questions.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.557
Dr. Simon,

26:42.557 --> 26:46.213
you testified that the
defendant's tumor was to blame

26:46.213 --> 26:48.998
for his losing control
in the moment.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.957
Is it also responsible

26:50.957 --> 26:54.090
for Mr. Fallon
asking Vincent Martinez

26:54.090 --> 26:56.484
if he could borrow his truck
on the night in question?

26:56.484 --> 26:58.965
No, I can't see
how it would be.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.531
Is it responsible

27:00.531 --> 27:03.883
for his driving
to Alexander Lockett's home

27:03.883 --> 27:06.407
with a loaded
semiautomatic pistol?

27:06.407 --> 27:07.887
No.

27:07.887 --> 27:13.414
Did it make him drive around
the block for 20 minutes,

27:13.414 --> 27:16.069
waiting for Lockett
to be alone,

27:16.069 --> 27:20.290
and sneak onto his property
with said gun?

27:20.290 --> 27:21.944
No.

27:23.554 --> 27:24.817
Thank you.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.645
No further questions.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.741
We knew
those burn pits were deadly.

27:35.741 --> 27:39.875
We'd wake up in the middle
of the night unable to breathe,

27:39.875 --> 27:44.140
choking on this thick cloud
that smelled like...

27:48.144 --> 27:51.844
They were burning
medical waste,

27:51.844 --> 27:54.629
chemicals.

27:54.629 --> 27:58.459
We begged Colonel Lockett
to do something.

27:58.459 --> 28:01.723
I mean,
guys were coughing up blood.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.639
But the colonel's residence

28:04.639 --> 28:07.816
is on the north end
of the base,

28:07.816 --> 28:09.296
upwind from the smoke,

28:09.296 --> 28:13.604
so why should he care, right?

28:13.604 --> 28:18.435
What happened
on the night of September 27?

28:18.435 --> 28:22.613
Shane had just
killed himself.

28:22.613 --> 28:25.355
I was upset.

28:25.355 --> 28:29.316
This is Shane Risner?

28:29.316 --> 28:34.277
The two of you were close,
weren't you?

28:34.277 --> 28:37.716
Closer than brothers.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.109
There wasn't a day
in the last two years

28:40.109 --> 28:45.245
he wasn't in excruciating pain
from the pulmonary fibrosis.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.681
And he was wracked with guilt

28:46.681 --> 28:50.380
about putting his family
in debt with medical bills

28:50.380 --> 28:53.601
because you lose
your VA benefits

28:53.601 --> 28:55.559
when you're
dishonorably discharged.

28:58.214 --> 29:02.523
His esophagus disintegrated.

29:02.523 --> 29:07.484
It literally hurt
for him to breathe,

29:07.484 --> 29:10.618
so he...

29:17.016 --> 29:19.801
I went over
to the colonel's house

29:19.801 --> 29:22.064
because I wanted him to know

29:22.064 --> 29:25.807
what happened because of him.

29:25.807 --> 29:29.550
And what did you do
when you got there?

29:29.550 --> 29:33.684
I confronted him.
I wanted an apology.

29:33.684 --> 29:36.775
I wanted him
to say he was wrong,

29:36.775 --> 29:39.821
but he refused.

29:39.821 --> 29:43.085
He wouldn't even say
the burn pits were bad.

29:45.871 --> 29:49.091
I got angry,

29:49.091 --> 29:51.267
and the next thing I remember,

29:51.267 --> 29:55.794
I was standing over him
holding my gun.

29:57.839 --> 30:00.842
But I swear,

30:00.842 --> 30:04.193
I never went there
intending to hurt him.

30:04.193 --> 30:08.241
Then why bring your gun?

30:08.241 --> 30:10.896
I always have it on me.

30:10.896 --> 30:14.856
After so many years in the
service, it's second nature.

30:14.856 --> 30:18.773
But I've never fired it
outside of combat

30:18.773 --> 30:20.427
and never would.

30:25.562 --> 30:28.609
No further questions.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.524
Let's break here for the day.

30:30.524 --> 30:33.744
We'll resume in the morning
for cross-examination.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.104
Excuse me, Counselors.

30:45.104 --> 30:49.282
Sergeant Major Bryce Crawford,
Army Office of Public Affairs.

30:49.282 --> 30:52.024
Do you have a moment?

30:52.024 --> 30:54.809
I have been tasked
with keeping tabs on this case,

30:54.809 --> 30:56.115
for obvious reasons.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.768
I can imagine.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.858
I have something
you need to see.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.339
What am I looking at?

31:03.339 --> 31:06.168
It's an after-incident report
from 2008

31:06.168 --> 31:08.605
involving Sergeant Luke Fallon.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.303
Involving how?

31:10.303 --> 31:11.478
The details of it
are in there,

31:11.478 --> 31:14.002
but the gist of it--

31:14.002 --> 31:15.656
during a routine night patrol

31:15.656 --> 31:17.832
in an area
just outside of Baghdad,

31:17.832 --> 31:19.312
Sergeant Fallon
got in an argument

31:19.312 --> 31:22.141
with three unarmed
Iraqi civilians.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.403
The fight got physical.

31:23.403 --> 31:26.058
Sergeant Fallon
discharged his firearm,

31:26.058 --> 31:28.016
killing one of the civilians.

31:28.016 --> 31:30.758
He's killed someone before?

31:30.758 --> 31:31.846
Why wasn't this report

31:31.846 --> 31:33.979
in Fallon's
military personnel file?

31:33.979 --> 31:36.633
Due to the sensitive nature
of the army's presence

31:36.633 --> 31:39.027
in that particular region
at that time,

31:39.027 --> 31:41.421
it was deemed classified.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.945
Was he ever formally charged
with anything?

31:43.945 --> 31:45.120
He was sent home.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.948
His time in the army was over.

31:46.948 --> 31:49.298
And for reasons
of national security,

31:49.298 --> 31:52.171
the report was never
made public knowledge.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.869
But given its value
in this case,

31:54.869 --> 31:57.002
I've been authorized
to declassify it.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.004
This is helpful.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.745
This directly refutes his claim
he'd never fired his weapon

32:01.745 --> 32:03.965
outside of active combat
prior to having the tumor.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.185
It also conveniently
shifts the focus away

32:06.185 --> 32:09.188
from the army's culpability
surrounding the burn pits.

32:09.188 --> 32:10.798
With all due respect, ma'am,

32:10.798 --> 32:14.367
operational decisions are easy
to criticize with hindsight.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.716
At the time,
the army had been

32:15.716 --> 32:17.631
using burn pits
for over 100 years.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.068
But when the kind of waste
you were burning changed,

32:20.068 --> 32:22.375
your procedure for burning it
should have changed too.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.203
We know that now.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.640
That's why we transitioned to
using industrial incinerators.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.338
What's important right now
is winning the case

32:29.338 --> 32:30.731
and using this document

32:30.731 --> 32:33.952
to prove that Fallon
isn't some noble martyr.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.518
He's a trigger happy hothead

32:35.518 --> 32:38.043
who responds to conflict
with violence,

32:38.043 --> 32:41.176
tumor or no tumor.

32:41.176 --> 32:43.265
We got him, Sam.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.452
That report details
how Luke Fallon shot

32:56.452 --> 32:57.888
and killed an unarmed--

32:57.888 --> 33:00.282
I know what it says.

33:00.282 --> 33:02.241
Why are you showing it to me?

33:04.373 --> 33:09.552
I know that you feel
a sense of duty to Luke,

33:09.552 --> 33:12.599
but he's a murderer
who belongs in prison.

33:12.599 --> 33:16.516
I'm sorry, Mr. Price,
but that,

33:16.516 --> 33:18.300
it's a bunch of crap.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.346
I was there.

33:20.346 --> 33:23.001
It wasn't a routine patrol.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.787
Fallon was sent on a mission
to recover stolen ordnance.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.658
He was instructed
to use deadly force

33:28.658 --> 33:30.138
because
the insurgents were armed.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.705
But the intel was bad,

33:31.705 --> 33:33.794
even worse that
an innocent civilian was killed

33:33.794 --> 33:36.536
because they were wrong
about who took them.

33:36.536 --> 33:40.366
You're saying
they just wholesale lied?

33:40.366 --> 33:42.890
Standard procedure.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.632
Disavow.

33:45.632 --> 33:48.461
Regardless
of what that report says,

33:48.461 --> 33:51.333
Luke Fallon was
just following orders.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.689
I don't feel comfortable
using that report.

33:59.689 --> 34:03.389
Because one soldier called
its veracity into question?

34:03.389 --> 34:05.086
Because I believe him.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.088
For all we know,
Vincent Martinez

34:07.088 --> 34:08.829
could be the one lying,

34:08.829 --> 34:13.181
trying, yet again, to protect
his fellow unit member.

34:13.181 --> 34:16.315
I'm pretty good at telling
when someone is lying to me.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.360
Don't you think
it's a little too convenient

34:18.360 --> 34:20.623
that this perfect piece
of evidence

34:20.623 --> 34:23.104
just fell from the sky
at exactly the right moment?

34:23.104 --> 34:24.671
Gift horses, Ms. Maroun.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.760
The army failed
to protect Fallon back then,

34:26.760 --> 34:29.023
and now they're trying
to distract from that fact

34:29.023 --> 34:31.112
by impeaching his character
with lies.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.592
And they want to use us
to do it.

34:32.592 --> 34:35.638
The tragedy
of his cancer diagnosis

34:35.638 --> 34:38.685
doesn't change the fact that
Luke Fallon committed murder.

34:38.685 --> 34:40.904
I agree, but getting a
guilty verdict with evidence--

34:40.904 --> 34:44.256
We have no proof
that the report is a lie.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.605
I don't trust--

34:45.605 --> 34:48.738
Nolan,
this conversation is over.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.263
If you can get the conviction
another way, be my guest.

34:51.263 --> 34:54.309
If not,
you're using the report.

34:56.572 --> 34:58.444
Are you pulling rank, Jack?

34:58.444 --> 35:01.969
Damn right I am!

35:01.969 --> 35:03.318
Understood.

35:14.416 --> 35:15.504
You find anything?

35:15.504 --> 35:16.679
Negative.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.116
You?

35:18.116 --> 35:19.421
Maybe.

35:19.421 --> 35:20.683
I've been looking through

35:20.683 --> 35:23.164
Alexander Lockett's
military personnel file,

35:23.164 --> 35:24.992
and I found something odd.

35:24.992 --> 35:27.995
The week
before he retired from service,

35:27.995 --> 35:31.781
the army offered him a position
back here in New York.

35:31.781 --> 35:35.481
Cushy deal too.
Title bump, good pay.

35:35.481 --> 35:37.831
But he turned it down.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.615
Maybe he'd already
gotten a better offer

35:39.615 --> 35:41.443
in the private sector.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.014
No, I don't think so.

35:50.583 --> 35:54.282
Mr. Fallon,
yesterday you testified

35:54.282 --> 35:58.373
that you never fired
your weapon outside of combat.

35:58.373 --> 36:01.028
Why did you make
that distinction,

36:01.028 --> 36:05.032
between using a weapon
in combat versus not?

36:05.032 --> 36:09.819
Because in combat,
I'm operating under orders.

36:09.819 --> 36:13.954
So if you're ordered
to shoot someone,

36:13.954 --> 36:17.523
you believe it changes
your culpability

36:17.523 --> 36:19.002
in whatever the outcome is?

36:19.002 --> 36:21.353
Yes,
because I don't have a choice.

36:21.353 --> 36:24.138
I'm following
the chain of command.

36:24.138 --> 36:27.402
But you held
Alexander Lockett responsible

36:27.402 --> 36:29.143
for the negative impacts
of the burn pit

36:29.143 --> 36:31.101
suffered by you
and your fellow soldiers.

36:31.101 --> 36:32.320
That's different.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.236
He was the one insisting
that they be used.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.456
He wasn't following orders.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.197
He was giving them.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.725
Your Honor, the prosecution
is entering into evidence

36:45.725 --> 36:47.857
People's Exhibit 27.

36:47.857 --> 36:52.035
This is the official paperwork
submitted by Alexander Lockett

36:52.035 --> 36:53.863
when he retired
from the army.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.735
Were you aware why he left?

36:55.735 --> 36:58.390
No, it happened
after my tours were over.

36:58.390 --> 37:01.480
He submitted
a written statement

37:01.480 --> 37:05.614
detailing his reasons
for leaving.

37:05.614 --> 37:10.053
"It has been my honor
to serve our great nation,

37:10.053 --> 37:12.230
"and I have nothing
but the utmost respect

37:12.230 --> 37:16.146
"for the brave men and women
with whom I have served.

37:16.146 --> 37:17.757
"It is on their behalf

37:17.757 --> 37:19.672
"that I must
leave the institution

37:19.672 --> 37:22.283
"I have dedicated my life to.

37:22.283 --> 37:26.287
"For four years,
I have requested

37:26.287 --> 37:27.419
"that my base be allowed

37:27.419 --> 37:29.769
"to cease
the utilization of burn pits

37:29.769 --> 37:32.293
"for the disposing of waste,

37:32.293 --> 37:34.600
"but repeatedly,

37:34.600 --> 37:37.124
"these requests
have been denied

37:37.124 --> 37:40.693
"and I have been ordered

37:40.693 --> 37:43.391
to maintain protocol."

37:43.391 --> 37:47.656
Can you please read this
passage aloud for the court?

37:52.357 --> 37:54.794
"I have been forced

37:54.794 --> 37:59.799
"to do something
that I believe is harmful,

37:59.799 --> 38:04.151
"and I can no longer
in good conscience

38:04.151 --> 38:05.761
"participate in a system

38:05.761 --> 38:11.158
that does not protect those
who so valiantly protect us."

38:21.429 --> 38:25.912
You claimed that
on the night of September 27th,

38:25.912 --> 38:29.481
you confronted Lockett,
and he refused to apologize,

38:29.481 --> 38:31.657
but that's
not what happened, is it?

38:31.657 --> 38:33.528
I didn't know.

38:33.528 --> 38:34.921
Objection.

38:34.921 --> 38:37.532
Overruled.
Sit down, Ms. Knight.

38:37.532 --> 38:42.363
If you had confronted him,

38:42.363 --> 38:45.627
he would have given you the
apology you claim you wanted...

38:48.108 --> 38:49.675
And explained

38:49.675 --> 38:55.202
that he tried to honor
his duty to protect you.

38:55.202 --> 38:58.205
But you didn't even give him
a chance to talk, did you?

38:58.205 --> 39:04.080
You just did what you went
there specifically to do.

39:05.734 --> 39:07.997
Murder him.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.568
I'm sorry.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.222
I thought...

39:19.531 --> 39:22.142
I'm so, so sorry.

39:50.475 --> 39:54.087
Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:54.087 --> 39:57.090
We have,
Your Honor.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.440
On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

39:59.440 --> 40:03.444
we find the defendant,
Luke Fallon, guilty.

40:21.375 --> 40:24.073
I can't thank you enough
for clearing my father's name.

40:24.073 --> 40:25.466
Well,
now that the trial is over,

40:25.466 --> 40:27.294
we'll make sure
his Distinguished Service Cross

40:27.294 --> 40:28.600
is returned to you.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.340
I appreciate that.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.563
If you'll excuse me.

40:35.563 --> 40:36.912
Of course.

40:43.266 --> 40:44.964
You were right.

40:44.964 --> 40:48.489
Alexander Lockett tried
to protect his men,

40:48.489 --> 40:51.492
but he chose to follow
the chain of command

40:51.492 --> 40:53.581
and ended up dying for it.

40:53.581 --> 40:56.628
He was a soldier,
and he was following orders.

40:56.628 --> 40:59.195
I get it.

40:59.195 --> 41:02.938
Still not sure
that makes it right.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.636
No one ever said it did.
