have Millie to myself

They wouldn't go home
without telling me.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.480
They said that
they didn't like the work.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.020
They couldn't leave
even if they wanted to.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.620
The mill keeps our pay -

12:31.720 --> 12:34.580
deducts food, rent, boots, everything.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.260
They don't have enough money
for a plane ticket.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.620
They don't even have their passports.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.800

I just came...

14:47.800 --> 14:49.180
to grab my formal shoes.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.900
- Oh.
- I forgot them.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.380

They're really pretty.

..and the spiritual forces of evil

28:35.080 --> 28:37.080
in the heavenly realm.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.860
How are you?

29:09.960 --> 29:12.700
Oh, you know - under the pump

29:14.640 --> 29:16.580

29:16.680 --> 29:18.140
How about you?
How you getting on?

29:18.240 --> 29:20.900
I'm a little bit troubled, actually.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.660
A couple of my boys from Tanna
have just dropped off the map,

29:23.760 --> 29:26.820
and we think that Billy Hopkins
might have driven them somewhere.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.500
Now, they're just 17.
We're just a little bit worried.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.260
Could you... could you ask him?

29:31.360 --> 29:33.460
Niman and Kalip's their names.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.700
Yeah, yeah, I'll ask.
But you know how vague Billy gets.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.260
Forget his own head
if it wasn't screwed on, eh?

29:39.360 --> 29:43.060
Maybe we should report them missing
to the police.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.860
Yeah, yeah,
well, we could do that, Izzy,

29:44.960 --> 29:48.300
but then the police might find
some undocumented workers.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.780
And, you know, your dad and I
have to... bend the rules a little bit

29:51.880 --> 29:55.540
just to make sure that, um...
everyone gets enough work.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.260
If we get the cops involved, we, um...

29:58.360 --> 30:00.480
might have to cut a few loose, you know?

30:02.040 --> 30:03.700
Joe, you're in charge of
human resources.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.220
What do you reckon?

30:05.320 --> 30:08.320

Shouldn't you be paying him, then?

out of this, alright?

30:14.480 --> 30:15.860
I'll talk to Billy.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.320
- God be with you, Steve.
- Yeah, and you too, mate.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.020
Don't you ever speak to your elders
like that again.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.100
It's true.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.740

No.

He's really cute.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.140
He's not my boyfriend.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.620
Kylie said that Adam said
that Max likes me.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.260
He wrote my name
on the outside of his shoes.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.480
I just didn't want Mum and Dad to see.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.660
I can do yours.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.860
Izzy loves Anton.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.480
- No.
- Why? Isn't he your boyfriend?

31:23.440 --> 31:24.780
I have an idea.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.880
OK.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.660
Well, isn't that cute?

32:08.440 --> 32:10.820

It's a donation.

That's very generous,
but at least take a cake.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.580
Oh, Izzy, you look beautiful.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.660
- Are you excited about the formal?
- Yeah. Really excited.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.300
Yeah. Anton says your dress is blue.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.700
'Cause I've made your corsage
out of silk flowers.

'cause it goes with everything.

I mean, I'll be amazed
if Anton lasts a year in the city.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.220
I mean, it's the son of a farmer.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.700
But, that's what
they want to do nowadays.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.340
- Anything to put off starting work.
- VICTOR: Mm-hm.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.180
Of course,
Izzy's scholarship's different.

but I can't have a white boyfriend.

on that Bianchi fella.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.900

45:00.360 --> 45:03.100
The next time I came home,
you couldn't pay me to be near him.

45:03.200 --> 45:06.640
Like, there was no attraction
whatsoever.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.720
I don't know. I can't explain it.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.520
AUNTY ROSA: I can.

45:16.040 --> 45:18.040
Kalana.

45:19.160 --> 45:21.160
It was her time.

45:22.200 --> 45:25.360
Doesn't matter
how she came into this world.

45:26.520 --> 45:28.520
She was meant to be.

45:32.120 --> 45:34.180
Yes, yes.

45:34.280 --> 45:36.400
(PHONE RINGS)

45:39.040 --> 45:41.180
- Hi, it's Hazel. Leave a message.
- (BEEP!)

45:41.280 --> 45:42.780
Hi.

45:42.880 --> 45:45.660
I, uh, I've got something important
to tell you.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.480
Can you meet me at the station
later tonight?

45:50.400 --> 45:53.380
Turner's at the business awards,
so the coast is clear.

45:53.480 --> 45:55.480
Yeah.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.720
HAZEL: I'm sorry, I lied.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.180
Anton's marriage would have got ruined

46:02.280 --> 46:04.360
if I had to come up and told the truth.

46:06.040 --> 46:09.560
And you went to never lie,
so I couldn't tell you guys either.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.460
You were protecting us.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.560
And Anton?

46:18.560 --> 46:20.420
No.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.520
Speak the truth.

46:23.160 --> 46:27.000
I just knew I'd done something horrible
and I couldn't face myself.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.360
I'm sorry.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.580
It's alright.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.680
We're going to be OK.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.940
Everything's going to be alright.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.040
Come on.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.660
(WHISPERS) It's all good.

46:45.760 --> 46:49.600
QUINN: Why would she come here
after her formal?

46:52.760 --> 46:54.760
(SIGHS)

46:55.680 --> 46:57.680
Maybe the boys were hiding here.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.800
Which would mean
this is where it happened.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.380
It feels that way.

47:05.480 --> 47:09.040
Except there's no red dirt,
and her dress was covered in red dirt.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.960
(OH MY LOVER BY PJ HARVEY
PLAYS LOUDLY)

47:28.800 --> 47:30.800
(DOOR OPENS)

47:33.600 --> 47:36.320
(OH MY LOVER CONTINUES)

47:39.920 --> 47:41.920
What's wrong? You OK?

47:43.680 --> 47:45.260
Mmm...

47:45.360 --> 47:47.420
(ENGINE REVS)

47:47.520 --> 47:49.860
This is... the song.

47:49.960 --> 47:51.960
What song?

47:52.360 --> 47:55.480
That was playing when Izzy called
at the servo.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.760
HAZEL: (ON PHONE)
Iz? Are you still there?

48:02.320 --> 48:04.320
I can't...

48:05.400 --> 48:08.500
Can't listen to it
without hearing that glitch.

48:08.600 --> 48:10.660
Huh? What glitch?

48:10.760 --> 48:13.420
(TAPE DISTORTS)

48:13.520 --> 48:15.520
That glitch.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.840
(TAPE STOPS)

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
OK.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.240
So...

48:26.680 --> 48:29.420
This was the tape that was playing
at the servo that night.

48:29.520 --> 48:34.180
No, this is a tape that Tasha
put in the time capsule.

48:34.280 --> 48:37.960
But it must be a copy of the one
she made for Anton.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.460
No...

48:42.560 --> 48:44.560
Anton loved my sister.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.740
She dumped him.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.400
He was drunk and he was emotional...

48:51.600 --> 48:52.860
His alibi's pretty weak.

48:52.960 --> 48:56.000
I mean, the only person
that can vouch for him is Tasha.

48:58.480 --> 49:01.760
And she's as reliable
as a bloody weather reporter.
