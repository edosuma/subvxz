00:14.220 --> 00:17.250
It's perfect. As long as you don't
get blind drunk or high on drugs.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.090
You need to speak to
my head of programming.

00:19.140 --> 00:21.010
His name's William Gardner.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.970
Kumalah arrived in
London a few minutes ago.

00:24.020 --> 00:26.250
Keep an eye on him. I want
to know everyone he meets.

00:26.300 --> 00:29.700
- 'Welcome to England, Mr Kumalah.'
- Thank you.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.690
What exactly are you
asking me to do, Michael?

00:37.740 --> 00:39.210
Investigate my own wife?

00:39.260 --> 00:41.690
I think that's exactly
what I'm asking you to do.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.410
You have no idea

00:43.460 --> 00:45.250
how I've been counting the hours.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.850
What you are doing, what
you have done, it's amazing.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.370
We did it together, David.

00:49.420 --> 00:52.160
Which is why we should be together.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.580
You should leave now!

01:01.500 --> 01:03.730
11, 12, 13!

01:03.780 --> 01:05.319
Just relax.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.090
His name is John Malik.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.770
And he is going to lead
us to Daniel Lorca.

01:11.820 --> 01:13.450
The SFO and the police,

01:13.500 --> 01:15.010
they're wasting their time

01:15.060 --> 01:16.650
chasing after Daniel Lorca.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.100
This is a man who consorts
with major criminals.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.770
Mr Lorca doesn't have any friends.

01:37.740 --> 01:40.730
Can I have some help,
please? Cardiac arrest.

01:40.780 --> 01:43.570
One of your patients, Michael
Freeland, died last night.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.730
- I gave him the right dose.
- We don't believe so.

01:45.780 --> 01:49.180
You should perhaps consider
taking legal advice.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.610
David Kumalah is a rising
star of East African politics.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.850
In London for an international conference,

01:59.900 --> 02:02.930
he's ruffled feathers with his
controversial views on aid.

02:02.980 --> 02:05.570
You give a country 5,000 mosquito nets,

02:05.620 --> 02:07.810
what does that do to the local factory

02:07.860 --> 02:10.610
that might be employing
people to make them?

02:10.660 --> 02:11.850
You give a country free food,

02:11.900 --> 02:14.210
how exactly does that
help the local farmers?

02:14.260 --> 02:16.810
'But surely your position is untenable.

02:16.860 --> 02:20.410
'Your country receives millions of
pounds of donations from charities,

02:20.460 --> 02:23.130
'such as Our Child in the UK.'

02:23.180 --> 02:26.130
What's he saying? - Shh. - 'We are
very grateful to the British people,'

02:26.180 --> 02:29.610
and for charities such as Our Child,
for everything they've done for us.

02:29.660 --> 02:33.410
But aid leads to corruption.
It leads to aid dependency.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.570
Are you saying your own
government is corrupt?

02:35.620 --> 02:38.970
Of course not. All I am saying
is that a constant supply

02:39.020 --> 02:41.570
of free money will test
any country's honesty.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.450
And there's always a danger that
it will actually end up keeping

02:44.500 --> 02:46.250
the wrong people in power.

02:46.300 --> 02:50.330
David Kumalah with some very
controversial views. Thank you.

02:50.380 --> 02:51.890
How can he say that?

02:51.940 --> 02:55.650
How can he be so ungrateful, after
all the money you've given him?

02:55.700 --> 02:58.490
As a matter of fact, I think he's right.
- What?

02:58.540 --> 03:00.850
I think he has a point.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.210
There has to be a better
way to bring about change,

03:03.260 --> 03:04.650
that's all he's saying.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.890
You know, Lisa, since you met this man...

03:06.940 --> 03:08.450
What?

03:08.500 --> 03:10.690
.. I don't feel like I know you any more.

03:10.740 --> 03:14.130
David Kumalah is a visionary, Paul.

03:14.180 --> 03:17.220
He's made me see things
differently, that's all.

03:19.180 --> 03:21.650
- Have you seen him in London?
- Not yet.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.690
You're getting too close to him.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.970
What are you talking about?

03:26.020 --> 03:27.690
Lisa Douglas.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.650
Thank you.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.620
Lisa, what is it?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.440
It's Michael. He...

03:55.260 --> 03:57.210
Don't want to drown no more

03:57.260 --> 03:59.450
Sick of the same old people

03:59.500 --> 04:01.770
The kind that'll sell your soul

04:01.820 --> 04:03.810
Trade it for a shinin' stone

04:03.860 --> 04:06.370
Ain't nothin' in this life for free

04:06.420 --> 04:08.890
Running from the greatest evil

04:08.940 --> 04:11.010
It finally dawned on me

04:11.060 --> 04:13.050
A man's got to fight temptation

04:13.100 --> 04:17.690
Keep the wolves from the door

04:17.740 --> 04:21.890
I hear them scratching
like I don't know better

04:21.940 --> 04:26.850
Won't you keep the wolves from the door?

04:26.900 --> 04:32.860
It won't be long before I
cave in and open up the door.

04:36.060 --> 04:39.730
I have to advise you, William,
that your victim, Michael Freeland,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.410
died last night.

04:41.460 --> 04:42.730
It's nowt to do with me.

04:42.780 --> 04:44.450
You broke into his flat.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.570
No.

04:45.620 --> 04:48.610
Jewellery, watches, laptops, artwork.

04:48.660 --> 04:50.770
Your place is quite an Aladdin's cave.

04:50.820 --> 04:53.420
You want to tell us all about it?

04:56.060 --> 04:58.970
You work for AJ Alarms.

04:59.020 --> 05:02.530
You used your programming
skills to bypass the systems

05:02.580 --> 05:04.490
and rip off your clients.

05:04.540 --> 05:06.490
Other ones, yeah, but not him.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.170
26 Lorimer Gardens.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.290
- I never went there!
- You're lying.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.170
You broke in, he came
down and surprised you,

05:13.220 --> 05:15.370
you stuck a knife in
him, and now he's dead.

05:15.420 --> 05:19.220
No! I swear to you, you've
got it wrong. It wasn't me!

05:25.580 --> 05:27.570
Well, don't just sit there.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.770
Well, what...?

05:29.820 --> 05:32.360
He's your age. You talk to him.

05:33.820 --> 05:35.500
Yeah, um...

05:38.540 --> 05:40.420
You want a drink?

05:41.460 --> 05:43.930
I can get you a coffee
or... or a sandwich.

05:43.980 --> 05:47.620
Wait a minute. I meant ask him
questions, don't offer him lunch.

05:52.420 --> 05:56.220
You've got a good job. How
did you get into all this?

06:07.740 --> 06:10.340
I don't think you stabbed anyone.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.970
But if we're going to convince my
DS, you're going to have to help me.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.760
I needed money.

06:21.820 --> 06:23.570
Why?

06:23.620 --> 06:24.970
I gamble.

06:25.020 --> 06:27.450
- Casinos?
- Online.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.380
- How much do you owe?
- 30K.

06:32.340 --> 06:34.690
- You must think I'm an idiot.
- Yes.

06:34.740 --> 06:36.940
I think you're an addict.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.210
I think you need help.

06:42.220 --> 06:46.780
Started stealing to pay my
debts. But I never hurt anyone.

06:47.980 --> 06:52.380
I swear to you. I never went
anywhere near Lorimer Gardens.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.930
That's very good, Derek. Fast work.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.610
Thanks, guv.

07:15.660 --> 07:18.490
He's admitted to all
seven. And the stabbing?

07:18.540 --> 07:21.290
He's holding out on Lorimer Gardens.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.010
He's scared, but we'll
get there in the end.

07:24.060 --> 07:27.330
Oh, guv! Oh... Sarge.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.810
I don't think it was him.

07:29.860 --> 07:32.090
What-What you going on about?

07:32.140 --> 07:37.780
I've got the CCTV footage. Lorimer
Gardens. No sign of Gardner.

07:41.140 --> 07:43.610
But there were two other people there.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.530
Jehovah's Witnesses.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.530
When you retrieved a whole lot
of stuff from Gardner's flat,

07:48.580 --> 07:52.050
did you find anything to tie
him in with Lorimer Gardens?

07:52.100 --> 07:54.850
No. He didn't take anything.
He didn't get the chance.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.130
Well, you searched his flat.
You must have found something.

07:58.180 --> 08:00.130
Missing laptop?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.970
Is there any blood on his clothes?

08:02.020 --> 08:03.330
No.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.460
- No forensics?
- No.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.620
Derek...

08:10.060 --> 08:14.490
What was the name of the nurse that looked
after Freeland after he was stabbed?

08:14.540 --> 08:16.250
According to the report,

08:16.300 --> 08:18.370
it was a Leila Sayyad.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.930
Any relation?

08:25.940 --> 08:27.090
She's my sister.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.930
Oh.

08:28.980 --> 08:31.380
Funny how it goes, isn't it?

08:31.980 --> 08:35.020
If he didn't kill Freeland,
then maybe she did.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.890
Maybe it WAS me.

08:40.940 --> 08:44.330
Maybe I got the settings wrong.
I don't know. I can't remember.

08:44.380 --> 08:45.530
Oh, come on.

08:45.580 --> 08:48.210
He was nearly stabbed to death
the night before and then, what,

08:48.260 --> 08:50.770
he dies from a massive drug overdose?

08:50.820 --> 08:53.420
Just tell us again what happened.

08:53.740 --> 08:57.490
'I had the potassium chloride, which
I'd brought from the dispensary.

08:57.540 --> 09:01.820
'I unlocked the machine and set
the dosage, and then he woke up.'

09:03.140 --> 09:05.210
Could anyone have changed the settings?

09:05.260 --> 09:09.560
Paul and Lisa Douglas were the
only other people in the room.

09:09.740 --> 09:11.730
Unless...

09:11.780 --> 09:13.810
There was something Lisa Douglas said.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.530
What was that?

09:17.220 --> 09:19.610
Hi.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.930
- Just got to give him this.
- What is it?

09:21.980 --> 09:23.920
Potassium chloride.

09:24.220 --> 09:26.570
Raised blood pressure?

09:26.620 --> 09:27.730
Yes.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.210
It struck me at the time.

09:29.260 --> 09:32.130
She wouldn't have known that
unless she'd had medical training.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.930
Maybe she'd worked as a nurse.

09:33.980 --> 09:37.290
The hospital is going to want
to charge you with manslaughter

09:37.340 --> 09:40.410
by gross negligence. We
have to be prepared for that.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.610
And, Leila, you must
get some legal advice.

09:43.660 --> 09:47.620
And, Rash, you and Stefan need to
find out what's really going on.

09:49.140 --> 09:50.970
Dr Benson.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.090
Yes.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.450
Do you remember me?

09:53.500 --> 09:55.420
Mrs Douglas.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.370
Look, I'm very sorry.

09:58.420 --> 10:02.290
It's not about that. The
newspapers are about to run a story

10:02.340 --> 10:04.890
on the nurse who was working
here when Michael died.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.050
Leila Sayyad.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.770
How do they know about her?

10:08.820 --> 10:11.210
Because I told them. I had her followed.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.660
I know everything about her.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.090
- I'm sorry?
- I want justice for Michael.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.250
The newspapers are going
to name and shame.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.810
- They may ask you to corroborate.
- I can't.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.890
Well, I'd think about it if I were you.

10:32.940 --> 10:35.330
If it isn't her,

10:35.380 --> 10:38.180
it's your neck on the line, isn't it?

10:46.940 --> 10:49.690
Our Child is an incorporated
and registered charity

10:49.740 --> 10:52.730
that was set up 11 years
ago by Lisa Douglas,

10:52.780 --> 10:56.250
although it was founded by
her husband, Paul Douglas.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.170
He owns a telecommunications business.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.930
You really owe me for this, Stefan.

11:02.980 --> 11:06.570
Go on.
- Well, it's raised millions of pounds.

11:06.620 --> 11:09.570
It had grants from central and
local government, and it's had

11:09.620 --> 11:12.730
a whole slew of celebrities
who have gotten behind it.

11:12.780 --> 11:14.450
Well, is it clean?

11:14.500 --> 11:17.490
It's been regularly audited. It's
been given a clean bill of health.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.610
What exactly is it you're looking for?

11:19.660 --> 11:22.610
I'm looking for a reason
why its accountant,

11:22.660 --> 11:25.490
a guy called Michael Freeland, was killed.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.980
Michael Freeland.

11:29.540 --> 11:30.770
I know that name.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.210
Yes, here.

11:32.260 --> 11:35.250
Michael Freeland was the
senior accountant at a firm

11:35.300 --> 11:37.930
called Carousel Securities for six years.

11:37.980 --> 11:40.610
Must have been before he joined Our Child.
- What about it?

11:40.660 --> 11:42.210
Well, it might be a coincidence,

11:42.260 --> 11:45.810
but Carousel Securities
was owned by John Malik.

11:45.860 --> 11:48.490
This is for the SFO?

11:48.540 --> 11:51.370
No. It's personal.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.290
'Serious Fraud Office?'

11:53.340 --> 11:54.860
Er, yeah.

11:59.260 --> 12:03.300
Sorry, what's that got to do with Michael?
- Um...

12:08.860 --> 12:11.930
We're investigating someone
he was associated with.

12:11.980 --> 12:14.180
A man called John Malik.

12:14.980 --> 12:20.460
Carousel. That's right.
Michael... used to work for him.

12:23.060 --> 12:28.090
- Why did he leave?
- He liked the idea of working for a charity.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.970
He saw Malik just a couple of weeks ago.

12:31.020 --> 12:34.140
- Do you know why?
- He said he wanted some advice.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.690
Mr Freeland.

12:37.740 --> 12:40.250
- How are you, Samuel?
- Haven't seen you in a while.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.250
- Is Mr Malik here.
- How is...? - Our Child.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.540
Our Child. That's right.
Must keep you busy.

12:47.940 --> 12:51.100
I need to see Mr Malik. It's important.

12:52.660 --> 12:56.060
He said it was important.
Don't know any more than that.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.810
Look, this...

12:59.860 --> 13:02.690
really isn't a very
good time for me, so...

13:02.740 --> 13:07.690
I'm sorry. Do the numbers 11,
12, 13 mean anything to you?

13:07.740 --> 13:10.130
No. Why? Should they?

13:10.180 --> 13:12.650
According to the nurse who
was with him in the hospital,

13:12.700 --> 13:14.530
that was the last thing he said.

13:14.580 --> 13:17.010
Was that the nurse who killed him?

13:17.060 --> 13:20.130
Yes, they told me there's
going to be an investigation,

13:20.180 --> 13:22.250
that it was her fault.

13:23.180 --> 13:25.580
She gave him the wrong dose.

13:29.020 --> 13:31.960
It's thanks to her that Michael is dead.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.010
Working late?

13:43.060 --> 13:44.860
Marcus, come in.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.410
- You fancy a whisky?
- I didn't know you had any.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.500
For emergencies.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.570
- Malik?
- Yes.

14:01.620 --> 14:04.290
He hasn't managed to
overturn the warrant yet.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.450
It's just a matter of time.

14:06.500 --> 14:10.210
Particularly if we have nothing on Lorca.

14:10.260 --> 14:12.930
Has Stefan got nowhere?

14:12.980 --> 14:15.370
Stefan got attacked...

14:15.420 --> 14:17.210
in the Turkish hammam.

14:17.260 --> 14:20.410
He was looking for Daniel Lorca.
And now the trail has gone cold.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.860
Oh, God.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.410
- You should go home.
- No, no, no.

14:27.460 --> 14:31.780
I've got... masses of work to catch up on.
- Is that true?

14:42.740 --> 14:44.410
You miss him?

14:45.780 --> 14:47.050
Yeah.

14:49.820 --> 14:51.490
I understand.

14:55.700 --> 15:00.050
So, Stefan, hm, yes, he's
asked for a referral.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.900
- For a new job?
- No, no, no, he's just moving flat.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.100
You like him, don't you?

15:09.140 --> 15:10.940
He has his uses.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.450
Keep him under control.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.600
I can't afford any more
problems right now.

15:32.580 --> 15:33.920
You OK?

15:35.820 --> 15:37.100
No.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.570
I can't believe this has happened.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.130
I can kiss med school goodbye.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.090
You're going back to uni?

15:50.140 --> 15:52.010
That was the plan.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.100
We'll get there.

15:59.420 --> 16:04.020
So, um, did Michael
Freeland have any enemies?

16:05.100 --> 16:06.850
John Malik.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.090
What about him?

16:09.140 --> 16:12.250
Freeland went to see him a couple
of weeks before he was killed.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.490
Right. What did he want?

16:14.540 --> 16:16.340
Why don't we ask?

16:21.580 --> 16:23.380
Michael Freeland.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.730
He was your accountant at Carousel.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.610
I know who he was, young man.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.810
You don't have to tell me.

16:30.860 --> 16:32.500
Have we met?

16:34.260 --> 16:35.690
I don't think so.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.850
Well, that's funny.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.970
I never forget a face.

16:41.020 --> 16:44.320
And I'm sure I have seen
you somewhere before.

16:45.940 --> 16:50.130
Er... Mr Malik, would you
mind answering the question?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.050
And what question was that?

16:52.100 --> 16:53.490
Did you see Michael Freeland?

16:53.540 --> 16:55.890
Yes. He came to see me.

16:55.940 --> 16:58.890
It was a Thursday, the week before last.

16:58.940 --> 17:00.650
What did he want?

17:00.700 --> 17:01.930
Freeland?

17:01.980 --> 17:05.210
I've found something and
I don't know what to do.

17:05.260 --> 17:07.450
I've come to you because...
Well, don't get me wrong,

17:07.500 --> 17:09.770
you know about these
things. You have experience.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.650
Could you look through these
accounts from Our Child,

17:12.700 --> 17:15.609
in confidence? I shouldn't have
taken them, but I need to be sure.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.650
There's something that doesn't make sense.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.010
I don't know, maybe they
do things differently there.

17:20.060 --> 17:22.690
I don't want to hurt anyone. I
don't want to cause any trouble,

17:22.740 --> 17:24.880
but I need your advice.

17:32.940 --> 17:35.570
I'm not sure I can remember.

17:35.620 --> 17:39.050
Mr Malik, Michael Freeland
died three days ago.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.530
I'm well aware of that.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.290
Wait a minute.

17:42.340 --> 17:44.540
You remember he was here.

17:44.780 --> 17:47.650
You remember what day he came here.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.300
You don't remember what he said?

17:51.060 --> 17:53.770
He was attacked in his home.

17:53.820 --> 17:55.820
His laptop was taken.

17:56.220 --> 17:58.770
It really might help us to know

17:58.820 --> 18:00.090
what was on his mind.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.770
DC Sayyid, was it?

18:01.820 --> 18:05.410
Sayyad. And I showed you
my warrant card, yes.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.260
I didn't see his.

18:08.220 --> 18:11.810
Mr Malik, we are just trying to get information
that will help us with a murder enquiry.

18:11.860 --> 18:15.060
Well, I'm afraid I can't
help you. I'm sorry.

18:15.940 --> 18:19.130
Yes, he did come to see me.
We had a chat and a drink.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.890
But he didn't say anything that
might be of any help to you.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.570
He didn't leave anything with you?

18:23.620 --> 18:26.860
I'm very busy. Why don't
you show yourselves out?

18:40.540 --> 18:42.940
Where the hell is my luggage?

18:43.420 --> 18:44.730
Here, sir.

18:44.780 --> 18:47.180
Well, don't keep me waiting.

18:49.380 --> 18:52.480
He was at the airport carrying my luggage.

18:53.940 --> 18:57.170
'And outside my house on
a bike during the raid.'

18:57.220 --> 18:59.050
He is SFO.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.370
He is with the bloody SFO.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.610
Working with the police?

19:03.660 --> 19:06.330
No. No.

19:06.380 --> 19:08.570
What did he say his name was?

19:08.620 --> 19:10.420
Stefan Kowolski.

19:11.620 --> 19:14.250
I want to know everything about him.

19:14.300 --> 19:18.020
Find out what he is
doing and where he lives.

19:19.860 --> 19:22.730
- He knew who I was.
- I thought you said he'd never seen you.

19:22.780 --> 19:26.260
I was at the airport the day
we raided. I followed him home.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.770
- We are running out of time.
- Why do you say that?

19:30.820 --> 19:32.160
Look...

19:36.100 --> 19:39.490
"Dr Benson admitted that he'd
left the trauma nurse on her own

19:39.540 --> 19:42.930
"after she insisted she was capable
of operating the infusion pump

19:42.980 --> 19:45.050
"without supervision."

19:46.020 --> 19:48.650
That's a complete lie.
That's not how it happened.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.410
Just be grateful for small mercies, Leila.

19:51.460 --> 19:54.400
At least he hasn't told them your name.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.880
Why are you hiding? Are you guilty?

20:16.540 --> 20:18.140
Take a seat.

20:25.940 --> 20:28.210
I have already spoken to the police.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.970
We know that, Mrs Douglas.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.770
We just wanted to ask a few more
questions about Michael Freeland.

20:33.820 --> 20:35.290
Please, go ahead.

20:35.340 --> 20:38.130
Before he died, Michael said something.

20:38.180 --> 20:40.380
- Three numbers.
- Yeah.

20:41.580 --> 20:44.330
'11, 12, 13. I heard him.'

20:44.380 --> 20:47.580
- Do you know what he meant?
- 'Yeah, I do, I do.

20:49.660 --> 20:52.570
'Well, there are 11 million
homeless children in Africa,'

20:52.620 --> 20:57.490
12% of whom are very likely to die
before they reach the age of 13.

20:57.540 --> 21:00.730
11, 12, 13. It was the name of a
charity drive we were considering,

21:00.780 --> 21:02.170
but then dropped.

21:02.220 --> 21:06.370
Really? It doesn't sound very likely.

21:06.420 --> 21:10.370
- Are you suggesting that I'm lying to you?
- Why did you drop it?

21:10.420 --> 21:13.370
- Because it wasn't memorable enough.
- You remembered it.

21:13.420 --> 21:16.810
Well, I would, wouldn't I?

21:16.860 --> 21:20.410
- Your car is here, Lisa.
- Oh, thank you, Wendy.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.690
Well, I'm so sorry I can't help you.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.620
I have a lunch.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.530
You remembered it.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.610
She was definitely hiding something.

21:40.660 --> 21:43.940
I know she was. - But? - What
is it she's not telling us?

21:45.460 --> 21:48.620
Oh, we're getting nowhere.
I've got to get back to work.

21:51.380 --> 21:54.330
- Keep walking.
- What? - Don't stop.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.850
Those guys in the car.

21:55.900 --> 21:58.420
- Don't look.
- What?

22:01.540 --> 22:05.650
Those two guys, I've seen
them before, on the CCTV.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.740
They were outside Michael Freeland's
house the night he got stabbed.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.060
So what are they doing here?

22:19.020 --> 22:20.360
Look...

22:23.460 --> 22:24.900
OK.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.320
- OK, what are we going to do?
- Just wait.

22:32.860 --> 22:35.210
Whoa...

22:35.260 --> 22:38.460
- We've got to follow that car.
- Right, how?

22:39.340 --> 22:40.570
Taxi!

22:40.620 --> 22:42.420
Follow that car.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.770
You're not being serious?

22:59.820 --> 23:02.650
- What?
- "Follow that car"?

23:02.700 --> 23:04.890
Look, just do it, all
right? I'm a police officer.

23:04.940 --> 23:07.730
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.780
I don't believe you.

23:11.900 --> 23:15.250
Right. Well, it makes no difference
... you're still paying the fare.

23:15.300 --> 23:16.650
Come on!

23:16.700 --> 23:20.130
- How much money do you have?
- Well... Nine quid.

23:20.180 --> 23:22.140
Same.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.660
It's not enough.

23:27.420 --> 23:30.010
OK, we've only got 18 quid, so
we have to owe you the rest.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.490
- Forget it. I don't do credit.
- We just showed you ID.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.370
It's not my problem.

23:34.420 --> 23:37.810
All right, just drop us off
when you get to 18 quid.

23:37.860 --> 23:39.770
Done! Go on, get out.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.560
Thanks, mate

23:44.100 --> 23:47.420
Come on, man. Come on,
we're going to lose them.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.050
Lisa.

24:16.220 --> 24:18.330
I've been thinking about
what you were saying.

24:18.380 --> 24:20.730
About leaving with you.

24:20.780 --> 24:24.380
That's very sudden. Aren't
you even going to order?

24:24.780 --> 24:27.170
Excuse me, could I have
a gin martini, please?

24:27.220 --> 24:28.890
Of course, madam.

24:28.940 --> 24:32.370
See, I worried about Paul.
He's been asking questions.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.090
I think he knows about us.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.410
I can deal with Paul.

24:36.460 --> 24:39.290
But we don't have much
time. I'm leaving tomorrow.

24:39.340 --> 24:40.730
So soon?

24:40.780 --> 24:44.370
Everything is in place. We
have all the support we need.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.890
I just have to press the button.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.570
We're going to make it happen.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.460
Mmm.

24:57.780 --> 24:59.450
Who is he?

24:59.500 --> 25:01.170
Saw him on TV.

25:01.980 --> 25:03.980
- Strictly?
- No...

25:06.540 --> 25:09.620
No, it was, eh, something to
do with Africa on the news.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.970
Surely your position is untenable,

25:13.020 --> 25:17.140
your country receives millions of
pounds of donations from charities.

25:19.540 --> 25:23.730
He was talking about charity. Come on.

25:23.780 --> 25:26.570
- Is he a regular guest at this hotel?
- David Kumalah?

25:26.620 --> 25:28.850
He stays here quite often.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.290
You do know that Mr Kumulah
is a government minister?

25:31.340 --> 25:33.650
He has a diplomatic passport.

25:33.700 --> 25:38.570
Yeah. We know. It's Mr
Kumulah we're worried about.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.690
Yeah, his, uh, safety.

25:49.020 --> 25:53.980
- Would you like me to stay?
- Eh... no, we'd like you to go.

25:55.260 --> 25:56.730
Thank you.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.820
Wow.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.460
Start here.

26:45.060 --> 26:46.530
Excuse me.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.900
What is it?

26:54.100 --> 26:56.300
Get up to the room... now.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.890
I'm going to have to leave you for a moment.
- What is it?

27:01.940 --> 27:04.880
Someone's trying to access my computer.

27:26.860 --> 27:28.450
It... It doesn't work, I can't get in.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.050
Thought you were supposed to
be good at this sort of thing?

27:31.100 --> 27:33.040
I am doing my best.

27:36.620 --> 27:39.330
- I-I can't do it.
- Date of birth, "1-2-3-4".

27:39.380 --> 27:43.090
It's not that simple,
it's going to be encrypted.

27:46.540 --> 27:47.810
(Shh.)

28:36.900 --> 28:39.840
Who are you and what are you doing here?

28:40.860 --> 28:44.540
Mr Kumulah... - We're the
police. - No, you are not.

28:46.660 --> 28:50.660
- I can show you my warrant card.
- I am not interested.

28:50.780 --> 28:54.410
You have broken into my room, you
are attempting to access my computer

28:54.460 --> 28:59.260
... whoever you are, your actions
have placed you outside of the law.

29:00.540 --> 29:04.250
We're, erm, we're investigating
the death of Michael Freeland.

29:04.300 --> 29:08.850
I don't care what you are
doing, you will leave here. Now.

29:08.900 --> 29:12.250
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.500
- Right.
- With my men.

29:15.780 --> 29:18.770
- They will escort you.
- Yeah, whatever you say.

29:18.820 --> 29:20.620
Whatever you say.

29:39.900 --> 29:43.500
- I don't like the look of this.
- Yeah, nor do I.

29:45.580 --> 29:49.570
Whoa, excuse me. I think
the lobby's that way.

29:49.620 --> 29:52.220
Yeah, we want to go to reception.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.940
That changes things.

30:07.340 --> 30:08.410
Ugh!

30:08.460 --> 30:09.660
Agh!

30:35.100 --> 30:36.570
This way!

30:44.100 --> 30:46.780
- Chairs!
- What? - Just...

30:48.940 --> 30:51.340
Yeah, all right, that'll do!

31:00.220 --> 31:01.580
Oi!

31:18.340 --> 31:20.180
Whoa! Take that.

31:21.620 --> 31:25.220
- What's this for?
- I don't know, might be useful!

31:29.220 --> 31:31.740
The lights!

31:34.220 --> 31:36.930
Why'd you do that? - What? - You
could have just turned them off.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.720
- But you gave me that!
- Come on!

31:46.580 --> 31:48.380
We've lost them.

31:49.700 --> 31:53.060
No, we haven't!

32:08.460 --> 32:10.380
Go, go, go!

32:11.540 --> 32:13.300
Rash, watch it!

32:19.100 --> 32:20.660
Get in!

32:23.860 --> 32:26.730
- Who are you?
- Get your heads down!

32:44.460 --> 32:47.200
My name's Finch, counter-terrorism.

32:48.100 --> 32:52.460
Police, SFO... why are
you working together?

32:54.300 --> 32:56.500
You better start talking.

33:00.260 --> 33:04.300
- We're investigating Our Child.
- The death of Michael Freeland?

33:06.180 --> 33:10.060
- That led us to Lisa Douglas.
- And she led us to Kumulah.

33:16.060 --> 33:20.170
So... why are you interested in Kumulah?

33:20.220 --> 33:24.660
I'm sorry, you really think I'm
going to tell you? Two boy scouts?

33:28.260 --> 33:29.730
- Well?
- Forget it.

33:29.780 --> 33:32.170
I don't know what the hell
you think you're doing,

33:32.220 --> 33:35.370
but you may have compromised
a major investigation.

33:35.420 --> 33:38.520
And I'm warning you, it doesn't stop here.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.570
Counter-terrorism? - Just had
them on the phone. - What about?

33:44.620 --> 33:46.330
- Where's Sayyad?
- I don't know.

33:46.380 --> 33:51.010
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- He's not here. - Well, I can see that.

33:51.060 --> 33:54.860
Do you know anything about
a man called David Kumulah?

33:55.140 --> 33:58.240
No.
- Do you know anything about anything?

34:01.740 --> 34:05.700
I want to see Sayyad. I
want him back here... now.

34:25.739 --> 34:28.969
- That's my boss.
- Aren't you going to answer it?

34:29.020 --> 34:32.130
I'll see him tomorrow,
if I've still got a job.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.850
- Heard that before.
- Gentlemen!

34:36.300 --> 34:37.639
Get in.

34:43.980 --> 34:45.460
Really?

35:08.340 --> 35:11.540
You want to know who
killed Michael Freeland.

35:12.820 --> 35:14.580
I can help you.

35:17.540 --> 35:20.970
He came to see me. You know that.

35:21.020 --> 35:26.810
He had stumbled onto something
and wanted my advice, and...

35:26.860 --> 35:28.860
he gave me something.

35:30.340 --> 35:34.980
Now, this here is a copy
of the Our Child accounts.

35:36.700 --> 35:40.580
- He asked me to look at them.
- Why didn't you tell us before?

35:42.060 --> 35:44.800
Because I didn't know who you were.

35:45.260 --> 35:46.730
I do now.

35:47.660 --> 35:50.060
And there's something I want.

35:52.780 --> 35:54.660
Go on.

35:56.540 --> 35:59.450
A DVD. It's marked "Bermuda".

35:59.500 --> 36:06.130
It was taken from my house... by your
friends at the Serious Fraud Office.

36:06.180 --> 36:11.140
- It has nothing to do with them.
- So, erm, what's on it?

36:12.220 --> 36:14.960
Images of me and my wife on holiday.

36:16.900 --> 36:20.580
You can watch the whole thing if
you have to, but I want it back.

36:22.260 --> 36:26.090
Some of it is, er... intimate.

36:26.140 --> 36:29.260
What? You mean...

36:31.820 --> 36:36.380
.. porn?
- Don't sneer at me, you little guttersnipe.

36:38.740 --> 36:42.770
They are private pictures
taken in private,

36:42.820 --> 36:44.930
and the SFO has no right to have them.

36:44.980 --> 36:48.380
- I want them back.
- Holiday pictures. - Yeah.

36:49.340 --> 36:51.890
It's a straightforward swap.

36:51.940 --> 36:56.570
Otherwise this conversation
never took place, and you can go

36:56.620 --> 36:58.820
and whistle in the wind.

37:09.980 --> 37:11.650
You're in early.

37:11.700 --> 37:14.370
- What are you doing with that?
- I was watching it.

37:14.420 --> 37:16.770
- It belongs to John Malik.
- Yeah, he wants it back.

37:16.820 --> 37:17.890
And he asked you to get it?

37:17.940 --> 37:20.690
Well, it's just holiday pictures,
I've watched the whole thing.

37:20.740 --> 37:23.130
It's evidence, Stefan,
it belongs to the SFO,

37:23.180 --> 37:25.210
you really think you can
walk in here and take it?

37:25.260 --> 37:27.210
You think I'd do that, Eleanor?

37:27.260 --> 37:29.400
Is that what you think?

37:34.420 --> 37:36.860
So... did you look at it?

37:38.540 --> 37:39.780
Yep.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.340
And?

37:45.500 --> 37:47.700
You had a lovely holiday.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.090
All right.

38:06.420 --> 38:07.890
Thank you.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.250
There's nothing on the DVD, so
why does he want it back so much?

38:19.300 --> 38:21.840
What is it he's not telling me?

38:27.220 --> 38:29.490
John Malik IS Daniel Lorca.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.730
He's the one who runs the company.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.290
Lorca has the house, the
clothes, the delivery,

38:34.340 --> 38:35.810
he goes to the Turkish hammam.

38:35.860 --> 38:38.290
But it's all just a shell
to make him look real.

38:38.340 --> 38:41.940
It's the perfect fraud. A
fraudster that doesn't even exist.

38:43.300 --> 38:46.040
And now we have everything we need.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.410
This is what Michael Freeland
found in the accounts.

39:45.460 --> 39:48.090
Someone has been stealing
money... a lot of it.

39:48.140 --> 39:49.610
How?

39:49.660 --> 39:53.210
Over the past three years,
Our Child have made payments

39:53.260 --> 39:55.850
totalling £15 million to six companies

39:55.900 --> 39:57.810
in six different countries.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.210
Here they are.

39:59.260 --> 40:01.290
Montsowarra Construction... six million.

40:01.340 --> 40:03.730
Karampa Medical Foundation
... three million.

40:03.780 --> 40:07.010
Mafinda Educational Supplies and so on.

40:07.060 --> 40:10.170
But they were all
incorporated on the same day.

40:10.220 --> 40:13.320
- That's not possible.
- Look at the dates.

40:14.100 --> 40:17.050
11th of December 2013...

40:17.100 --> 40:19.820
11th of December 2013.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.690
11, 12, 13.

40:25.740 --> 40:28.890
That's what he was trying to
explain. They're all fake.

40:28.940 --> 40:30.680
Fake companies.

40:31.940 --> 40:34.170
- The money goes in...
- They take it out.

40:34.220 --> 40:37.370
And in the meantime, they've got
counter-terrorism coming after them.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.450
What are you two involved in exactly?

40:39.500 --> 40:43.540
Did you just say counter-terrorism?
You should drop this NOW.

40:47.180 --> 40:50.730
Arash Sayyad is a TDC and Stefan
Kowolski is a junior at the SFO.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.970
They don't even work together.

40:53.020 --> 40:56.250
So... Well, what are the two of
them doing tied up with Kumulah?

40:56.300 --> 40:58.490
Nearly getting themselves
killed investigating

40:58.540 --> 41:00.250
the death of the Our Child accountant.

41:00.300 --> 41:05.850
You know, if these two kids manage
to get themselves knocked off...

41:05.900 --> 41:08.100
that could be our way in.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.690
Back at the car park...

41:11.740 --> 41:15.050
it would have been better
if I'd never intervened.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.540
Yeah.

41:18.420 --> 41:21.250
If they rub up against Kumulah again,

41:21.300 --> 41:23.970
it's probably better you back off.

41:45.460 --> 41:48.820
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving you, Paul.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.640
No, you're not.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.770
How much money have you
given to David Kumulah?

41:57.820 --> 42:00.220
That's none of your business.

42:00.900 --> 42:04.050
Ohh, I should have listened to Michael.

42:04.100 --> 42:07.890
The financial irregularities, they
were down to you, weren't they?

42:07.940 --> 42:10.450
How much money have you
actually stolen, Lisa?

42:10.500 --> 42:13.490
Oh, God, you really have no
understanding, do you, Paul?

42:13.540 --> 42:17.850
There's only way to make change
in Africa, that's his genius.

42:17.900 --> 42:20.130
You get rid of corrupt government,

42:20.180 --> 42:23.690
you cut out this addiction
to aid and charity and you...

42:23.740 --> 42:26.680
You build a country from the bottom up!

42:27.300 --> 42:29.970
What are you two planning then?

42:30.020 --> 42:31.890
Some kind of armed uprising?

42:31.940 --> 42:34.490
Yeah, that's exactly what we're planning.

42:34.540 --> 42:36.540
We're starting again.

42:37.700 --> 42:40.090
We need to talk to Mrs Douglas.

42:40.140 --> 42:43.330
I'm sorry, Mrs Douglas isn't
working from the office today.

42:43.380 --> 42:46.780
- Eh, where is he?
- She's working from home.

42:49.580 --> 42:53.580
Michael found out what you
were doing, didn't he? He knew.

42:56.940 --> 43:00.820
And you tried to kill
him. - No. - Yes, Lisa.

43:03.260 --> 43:05.090
There was no burglary.

43:05.140 --> 43:07.770
Michael came to see me, he was frightened,

43:07.820 --> 43:10.970
and that very same night he was stabbed.

43:11.020 --> 43:14.120
- That wasn't me.
- But it was done for you.

43:15.260 --> 43:19.490
And then at the hospital, when
you realised he wasn't dead...

43:19.540 --> 43:21.900
No, it was the nurse.

43:23.340 --> 43:26.340
- It was the nurse.
- It wasn't the nurse.

43:34.220 --> 43:36.610
All right, Mr Freeland, don't try to move.

43:36.660 --> 43:39.100
11, 12, 13.

43:44.700 --> 43:49.370
- God help you, Lisa.
- I'm leaving with David, Paul.

43:49.420 --> 43:52.160
You're never going to see me again.

43:59.100 --> 44:00.370
Lisa.

44:58.060 --> 45:01.700
- Mr Douglas? Police.
- My wife... you have to stop them.

45:02.780 --> 45:06.580
Take my car! The ambulance is on its way.
- Come on!

45:12.780 --> 45:14.090
You've got to call it in.

45:14.140 --> 45:16.050
I can't, he's got diplomatic immunity.

45:16.100 --> 45:18.690
- Anyway, it's too late.
- You've got to call it in!

45:18.740 --> 45:20.210
They've just stabbed a man.

45:20.260 --> 45:22.450
I noticed.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.490
That's them, that's them.

45:24.540 --> 45:26.080
We got 'em.

45:36.740 --> 45:38.740
We're being followed.

45:46.460 --> 45:48.660
Oh, they're turning off.

46:06.140 --> 46:07.610
Do it now.

46:13.140 --> 46:14.420
Gun!

46:53.380 --> 46:54.650
Jesus.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.570
You hurt?

46:59.660 --> 47:01.820
We're upside down.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.660
Yep.

47:05.780 --> 47:08.570
There's something dripping down my back.

47:08.620 --> 47:10.770
- What's dripping down my back?
- Oh, it's...

47:10.820 --> 47:12.850
- It's petrol.
- What?!

47:12.900 --> 47:14.500
It's petrol!

47:15.260 --> 47:18.340
- Well, I think we should get out!
- Yeah. Definitely.

47:22.580 --> 47:24.020
Come on!

47:26.460 --> 47:28.580
How... could this...

47:29.740 --> 47:31.410
Get any worse?

47:32.740 --> 47:34.810
They're coming back!

47:34.860 --> 47:36.730
Get out!

47:36.780 --> 47:38.850
- I can't.
- Rash, get out!

47:38.900 --> 47:41.170
- Rash!
- I can't! - Rash!

47:42.820 --> 47:44.220
Get out!

47:45.100 --> 47:48.300
- Wiggle it!
- I have wiggled it, it's stuck!

47:53.620 --> 47:55.420
What's he doing?!

48:02.260 --> 48:04.200
What are you doing?

48:11.220 --> 48:13.420
- Keep pulling!
- I am!

48:18.860 --> 48:20.260
Come on!

48:41.340 --> 48:42.740
Come on!

48:43.660 --> 48:46.090
I told you, I can't move. I'm stuck.

48:46.140 --> 48:48.410
Yeah, I'll help.

48:48.460 --> 48:49.930
- Come on.
- It's no good.

48:49.980 --> 48:52.570
It's coming!

48:54.020 --> 48:55.770
- Go!
- I'm not going without you!

48:55.820 --> 48:58.410
- I don't want to go sitting here!
- I'm not leaving you!

48:58.460 --> 49:00.290
Why do you have to be so bloody obstinate?

49:00.340 --> 49:02.540
It's coming! It's coming!

49:03.380 --> 49:05.940
- Just go!
- Oh, come on!

49:07.980 --> 49:09.380
Come on!

49:11.660 --> 49:13.260
Go! Rash!

49:52.380 --> 49:54.320
Out of the car now!

50:55.740 --> 50:57.480
That was close.

50:59.940 --> 51:01.340
Thanks.

51:02.620 --> 51:05.490
You should have just left me.

51:05.540 --> 51:07.490
You're right.

51:07.540 --> 51:10.780
No, I'm... You're my mate, I'd
have done the same for you.

51:11.940 --> 51:13.490
Hey!

51:13.540 --> 51:17.240
You want to tell me what
the bloody hell's going on?

51:19.620 --> 51:21.820
- Sarge...
- Who's this?

51:24.180 --> 51:27.210
Look, we've had another
call from counterterrorism.

51:27.260 --> 51:29.770
They'll handle Kumalah from now on.

51:29.820 --> 51:33.010
The governor wants to see
you in his office tomorrow.

51:33.060 --> 51:35.530
We've got to get to a flat,
sir. It's very important.

51:35.580 --> 51:37.290
Can you give us a lift?

51:37.340 --> 51:38.370
You've got a car.

51:38.420 --> 51:40.460
No, sir! Sir!

51:42.380 --> 51:43.520
Aw.

51:44.900 --> 51:46.530
He's nice.

51:46.580 --> 51:48.970
So much for that.

51:49.020 --> 51:50.930
The flat.

51:50.980 --> 51:52.450
We're too late.

51:52.500 --> 51:54.650
We can call them.

51:54.700 --> 51:56.170
No signal.

51:58.020 --> 52:00.330
You know, just once,

52:00.380 --> 52:02.410
just once in our lives, we
had to be there on time.

52:02.460 --> 52:03.530
We can still make it.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.490
No, we can't, it's on
the other side of town.

52:05.540 --> 52:07.540
We've got 40 minutes!

52:09.260 --> 52:10.890
Stefan.

52:10.940 --> 52:12.810
- Stefan.
- What?

52:14.020 --> 52:15.050
No.

52:15.100 --> 52:16.690
- We can make it!
- Stef.

52:16.740 --> 52:18.540
- Come on!
- No!

52:31.980 --> 52:34.450
- Whoa!
- Stop him, stop him!

52:48.540 --> 52:50.740
I told you we'd make it.

52:57.140 --> 53:00.140
I think we've given them long enough now.

53:10.140 --> 53:11.280
Hi.

53:13.620 --> 53:15.420
Sorry we're late.

53:17.740 --> 53:19.660
We got held up.

53:22.100 --> 53:24.330
So, why were the spooks interested

53:24.380 --> 53:26.850
in dark doings in sub-Saharan Africa?

53:26.900 --> 53:29.370
Oh, politics, Derek, politics.

53:30.260 --> 53:33.690
Yeah, word got out that
Kumalah was organising a coup

53:33.740 --> 53:36.970
and someone higher up wanted it stopped.

53:37.020 --> 53:39.410
Didn't he have diplomatic immunity?

53:39.460 --> 53:41.850
- Not any more.
- Here's to him.

53:41.900 --> 53:43.970
We get the credit, Derek.

53:44.020 --> 53:47.180
We've done, um, very well out of it.

53:49.900 --> 53:52.690
Question is, though,

53:52.740 --> 53:55.410
what are we going to do about DC Sayyad?

53:55.460 --> 53:57.010
Guv.

53:57.060 --> 54:00.000
His six-month probation is up next week.

54:01.580 --> 54:03.720
I think he should stay.

54:06.340 --> 54:08.740
I thought you would say that.

54:13.340 --> 54:16.210
Investment fraud, false accounting,

54:16.260 --> 54:19.730
bribery, extortion, possession of fake ID.

54:19.780 --> 54:21.930
I don't think we're going
to be seeing Mr Malik again

54:21.980 --> 54:24.920
- for a very long time.
- Where is he?

54:25.020 --> 54:27.130
Oh, the police released
him on bail this morning,

54:27.180 --> 54:29.890
but he... he will go down.

54:29.940 --> 54:31.290
So, what is this?

54:31.340 --> 54:33.410
If this is not an emergency.

54:33.460 --> 54:36.700
Well, I think we're allowed
to celebrate once in a while.

54:40.580 --> 54:43.300
Yes, uh... mm-hmm.

54:44.460 --> 54:45.660
Yes.

54:46.780 --> 54:49.450
Actually, we've finished
interviewing the candidates,

54:49.500 --> 54:52.440
and we came to the unanimous decision...

54:54.660 --> 54:56.330
But I don't understand.

54:56.380 --> 54:59.090
I mean, they were completely wrong.

54:59.140 --> 55:01.570
- Yes. Yes.
- 'Good.'

55:01.620 --> 55:03.730
Whatever you say.

55:03.780 --> 55:05.720
I'll let them know.

55:13.820 --> 55:16.370
- Shall we go for a drink?
- No need to go out.

55:16.420 --> 55:19.130
Present for house firing.

55:19.180 --> 55:21.520
- House warming.
- Firing.

55:22.380 --> 55:23.920
What is it?

55:25.420 --> 55:27.490
Don't touch it.

55:27.540 --> 55:29.410
Thank you.

55:29.460 --> 55:31.200
Just one glass.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.900
- Nasdarovje.
- Nasdarovje.

55:45.260 --> 55:49.090
- So, they're moving in.
- I don't get it.

55:49.140 --> 55:52.050
Why do you want them in your property?

55:52.100 --> 55:53.730
Those two little bastards?

55:53.780 --> 55:56.180
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you why.

55:56.540 --> 55:59.570
Because I've got them where I want them.

55:59.620 --> 56:02.290
Now they're paying me money.

56:02.340 --> 56:05.210
But one day, I promise you,

56:05.260 --> 56:07.220
I'm really going to make them pay.

56:08.305 --> 56:14.535
