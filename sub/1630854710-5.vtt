00:01.440 --> 00:04.440
In the world today, protecting
a country's borders is vital.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.920
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.200
These are the men and women in
uniform responsible for safeguarding

00:13.240 --> 00:14.440
Ireland's borders.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.640
Stopping...

00:15.680 --> 00:17.920
Look at me. Behind the
yellow line. ..Searching...

00:17.960 --> 00:19.576
Have you been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.616
Will you just listen to me?
Will you just listen to me?

00:21.640 --> 00:25.000
..And seizing drugs,
arms and illegal goods.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.520
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.720
Saving lives...

00:29.760 --> 00:32.080
I'd say about 200km per hour.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.680
..And protecting
Ireland's inhabitants

00:33.720 --> 00:36.040
and millions of
visiting tourists.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.720
You could have
been here 100 times,

00:37.760 --> 00:40.600
it doesn't mean that you're
guaranteed to get in the 101st time.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.960
They police the ports...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.640
Well, you have to make sure

00:44.680 --> 00:46.840
there's definitely nobody
underneath the vehicle.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.440
..The airports...

00:48.480 --> 00:50.120
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

00:50.160 --> 00:53.120
..And the roads. These are
very badly damaged straps.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.360
If you can't drive the truck,
shouldn't be on the road.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.440
These are the:

01:06.280 --> 01:10.920
A Mexican passenger needs to
convince immigration on her intentions.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.600
Do you have the
name of the hotel?

01:14.360 --> 01:17.240
Trucks with tyre troubles
are heading for the border.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.216
If he was to get a blowout
going along the road,

01:19.240 --> 01:20.920
he could lose his load.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.960
And a Van full of weapons
is stopped at Dublin port.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.920
Dublin airport is Ireland's
busiest entry point

01:37.960 --> 01:40.080
for passengers
flying to the country.

01:40.120 --> 01:44.520
4,000 people are refused leave
to land in Ireland every year,

01:44.560 --> 01:47.920
10% of whom come
from South America.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.480
A young Mexican lady has
just landed and has arrived at

01:51.520 --> 01:54.440
officer Danny O'Connell's
desk. Hello. How are you?

01:57.720 --> 01:59.840
And how long are
you staying with us?

02:02.840 --> 02:04.040
Five days.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.000
To Prague? Mm-hm. Very good.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.520
So, why are you here? Tourism?

02:12.560 --> 02:14.480
Mmm. Very good.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.080
First time in Ireland?

02:18.560 --> 02:20.920
How much money do
you have for your stay?

02:23.680 --> 02:24.680
Yeah.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.920
400 Euros.

02:32.680 --> 02:36.680
Officer O'Connell needs to
determine if she qualifies as a visitor.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.600
As part of their profiling process,
customs officers want to know that

02:40.640 --> 02:44.520
travellers have enough money
with them to meet their basic needs.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.920
If he's not satisfied,
she may not be granted

02:46.960 --> 02:49.080
permission to enter the country.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.080
Where will you stay?

02:55.520 --> 02:57.400
Your two brothers.
Are they here?

02:59.120 --> 03:00.560
Very good.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.800
In Dublin?

03:02.840 --> 03:05.400
And is the hotel paid for?

03:05.440 --> 03:07.000
Mm-hm. Paid for already?

03:07.040 --> 03:10.040
Paid for. By you
or by your brothers?

03:10.080 --> 03:12.160
Your brothers.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.040
Do you have the
name of the hotel?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.840
He wants to be sure that
she is telling the truth about

03:18.880 --> 03:20.640
her reasons for
being in Ireland.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.720
So, he's at the hotel
already? Mm-hm.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.800
Can you give me his contact
number, please? Yeah.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.320
Yeah. Please.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.280
He needs to ensure that she
doesn't become one of the many

03:39.320 --> 03:43.680
who disappear every year,
seeking access to the UK and Europe

03:43.720 --> 03:45.360
via the back door of Ireland.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.600
But it seems she can't
get through to her brother.

03:55.760 --> 04:00.440
Today, road safety authority
inspector Tommy Wright is roadside.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.080
We're down in waterford port.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.040
We're going to be
stopping stuff on the way in,

04:05.080 --> 04:06.560
to carry out inspections.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.480
He's Manning a check point
on the only road in and out

04:10.520 --> 04:14.400
of waterford port, the cargo
gateway to Ireland's south-east.

04:14.440 --> 04:18.440
Every truck using the port
will have to pass his way.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.440
At the port, you're guaranteed
more traffic coming in here, like,

04:21.480 --> 04:23.800
because they all have a purpose.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.600
How are you doing? Alright.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.560
Oh, boy, there's
some heat out there.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.040
I'll be like a Turkey
by the time I'm finished.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.800
Finding a defect could lead
to a truck being pulled off

04:32.840 --> 04:36.600
the road and the driver unable
to continue with their journey.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.360
You can understand people getting
wound up about being stopped.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.240
They have to be in
wherever it is, like,

04:41.280 --> 04:42.720
but if we don't do
our job properly,

04:42.760 --> 04:44.376
well, then something could
happen down the road, like.

04:44.400 --> 04:49.160
The rsa's target is for Ireland to
have one of the lowest casualty rates

04:49.200 --> 04:52.560
in Europe and it's through
continued roadside checks like this

04:52.600 --> 04:54.600
that they will reach their goal.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.080
Thank you. Have a
good day. Bye-bye.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.000
With this first
vehicle on its way,

05:03.040 --> 05:05.720
the next truck is
waiting for its inspection.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.680
Each driver is required by law to
perform a walkaround check every day

05:14.720 --> 05:17.080
to make sure the vehicle
is in good working order.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.360
These inspections are a
simple way to make sure

05:21.400 --> 05:23.040
this procedure is taking place.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.696
He should have done a
walkaround check today.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.576
He should have seen
that the tyre was like that

05:27.600 --> 05:29.400
and it should have been changed.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.600
It's unsafe, it's dangerous.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.320
If he was to get a blowout
going along the road,

05:33.360 --> 05:37.040
he could lose his load and that
could be thrown all over the place.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.920
So that's how bad it is, like.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.360
Every year, the rsa inspects
thousands of trucks and buses

05:44.400 --> 05:47.200
at the roadside to
check if they're compliant.

05:47.240 --> 05:51.080
In 2016, over 15,000
vehicles were checked,

05:51.120 --> 05:54.600
with 43% of them found
to have at least one defect.

05:55.960 --> 06:00.120
Tyres that weren't roadworthy
and often incredibly dangerous

06:00.160 --> 06:02.320
was the most common issue found.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.520
My colleague is after
speaking to the guard,

06:04.560 --> 06:06.520
so what he's going
to be allowed to do,

06:06.560 --> 06:10.040
because here isn't a place that
you can change a tyre easily,

06:10.080 --> 06:12.320
he's going to be allowed
to go down to the port.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.880
A tyre man will have to come

06:13.920 --> 06:16.136
and change the tyre before
he's allowed to go any further.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.080
He's only a couple of hundred
yards away from the port so the guard

06:19.120 --> 06:21.360
is happy enough to leave
and go down as far as there

06:21.400 --> 06:23.800
and it'll be sorted then before
he goes back on the road.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.600
But it shouldn't have been
like that in the first place.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.176
He shouldn't have picked
up a load of timber with

06:29.200 --> 06:30.800
a tyre that's as
bad as that, like.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.080
The next truck along is
carrying the same load to the port.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.560
But will it be in a
more roadworthy state?

06:42.600 --> 06:45.360
Did you do a
walkaround check today?

06:45.400 --> 06:46.840
Ok. And have you
means of recording

06:46.880 --> 06:48.080
your defects if you find any?

06:48.920 --> 06:50.280
Why is that?

06:51.920 --> 06:54.040
How do you mean, you don't know?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.560
You know you're required by law

06:55.600 --> 06:57.080
to carry out a walkaround check?

06:57.120 --> 06:58.840
Yeah. When you
find something wrong,

06:58.880 --> 07:01.560
you need to record
it on it, yeah? Alright.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.080
Ok, what I'm going to do is i'm
gonna have a look around, ok?

07:04.840 --> 07:07.600
It doesn't matter what
kind of a panic or rush that

07:07.640 --> 07:10.880
the driver is in, we still have
our job to do as the guards have.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.536
We have to enforce the regulations
to make sure that all the vehicles

07:13.560 --> 07:15.840
are in a roadworthy condition.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.920
We have to make
sure that things are ok

07:20.960 --> 07:23.520
before they're allowed
to proceed, like, so.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.000
Tyre is below the legal limit.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.520
It's bald in
three-quarters of it, like.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.816
There's no excuse for a
fella that's driving the same rig

07:30.840 --> 07:32.240
every day of the week.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.040
He should know the
condition of his tyres.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.120
All he has to do is bend down
and have a look and he'll know.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.000
He's required by law to do it
every day so, when he sees that

07:40.040 --> 07:41.376
they're getting as
bad as they are,

07:41.400 --> 07:43.136
he should have dealt
with it before now, like.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.456
It shouldn't have
to be the case that

07:44.480 --> 07:46.080
I have to deal
with it on the road.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.400
He's after coming from
up the middle of the country

07:48.440 --> 07:50.480
all the ways down here
to the south-east, like,

07:50.520 --> 07:52.600
with a full load of
timber on-board, like.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.600
So, with today that's in the heat
that's there, the tyre could blow.

07:57.640 --> 08:01.200
The driver needs to
take immediate action.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.080
Did you not see
those tyres yourself?

08:05.320 --> 08:07.120
Under the limit.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.120
Yeah? How often
does it go in for...

08:10.000 --> 08:11.896
It goes in every weekend, so
it isn't today or yesterday that

08:11.920 --> 08:14.240
they're like that,
like, you know?

08:14.280 --> 08:17.600
The onus was on him to make
sure his vehicle is roadworthy.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.760
He obviously didn't do that so
he'll have to replace the tyres

08:20.800 --> 08:22.720
down there, the same
as the last person,

08:22.760 --> 08:24.000
make contact with us.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.120
We will then come down

08:26.160 --> 08:28.920
and check to make sure
that they have been changed.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.400
Ok. So, I expect to hear from
you in the next hourish, alright?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.080
Good man. Thanks very much.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.256
Well, you can understand
it for the price of tyres, like.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.960
They're a couple of hundred
Euros a pop, like, you know?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.920
So you can understand
it to a certain extent,

08:41.960 --> 08:43.320
it's getting the
most out of them.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.776
But you can get the most out of
them and you can still be legal,

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
do you know what I mean?

08:46.840 --> 08:48.840
The cost of a tyre

08:48.880 --> 08:52.480
is a small price to pay for
better safety on the roads.

08:52.520 --> 08:56.720
This driver has got an hour to
sort it and the clock is ticking.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.920
Back in Dublin airport...

09:00.960 --> 09:02.560
Hello. How are you?

09:02.600 --> 09:06.720
..This passenger from Mexico
claims to be meeting her brother.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.080
Officer O'Connell
needs to verify her story.

09:11.120 --> 09:15.080
He's asked her where she's staying
but she says she doesn't know.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.120
Yeah. Please.

09:19.160 --> 09:23.080
For him to be able to make the right
decision, the officer needs to speak

09:23.120 --> 09:25.440
to her brother, but
she can't get through.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.000
Do you have his number
and I can ring him from here?

09:29.920 --> 09:33.920
Not to be deterred, he gets the
phone number and tries himself.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.480
But before he can get
through to her brother,

09:40.520 --> 09:43.200
the passenger finds
the name of the hotel.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.000
This is where you will stay?

09:45.040 --> 09:48.120
Mm-hm. Ok. Ok. That's ok.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.480
Now, photo. Just
over here, please.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.600
Yep.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.280
Satisfied with the
information she gives,

09:57.320 --> 09:59.680
he takes her photo for
the immigration database...

09:59.720 --> 10:02.560
Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.320
Now your documents
and your passport.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.360
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.320
..Before allowing her
entry to Ireland. Next.

10:18.840 --> 10:23.480
Dublin international airport
serves 180 routes with 41 airlines.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.800
This can cause one or two
headaches at immigration for the officers

10:27.840 --> 10:29.800
on the front line.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.200
At garda officer
Mick lhalley's booth.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.920
What are you doing here?

10:33.960 --> 10:37.520
..There are problems with a young
man who doesn't speak English.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.040
Does he speak English?

10:42.840 --> 10:45.000
Do you speak English?

10:45.040 --> 10:48.960
Ok. And you're sending the guy
up first who speaks no English?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.640
You send up the guy
who speaks no English.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.600
You're travelling together?

10:57.760 --> 11:00.160
What are you doing here?

11:02.240 --> 11:03.280
What?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.880
What are you doing here?

11:08.080 --> 11:10.360
Can I see your tickets
to leave, please?

11:15.040 --> 11:17.680
And at detective garda
ray flannery's booth,

11:17.720 --> 11:21.320
a Portuguese couple have just
approached with their passports.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.480
Why are you here?

11:27.920 --> 11:32.160
And he uses the opportunity to
show off his fluent Portuguese.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.240
It's due to his
multilingual skills

11:45.280 --> 11:48.120
that he is able to
process the couple quickly.

11:53.640 --> 11:58.240
In his booth, officer lhalley is
become increasingly frustrated.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.640
Listen. Excuse me. Excuse me.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.720
Everybody flies on e-tickets.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.840
You print off your
itinerary if you wish

12:06.880 --> 12:08.720
to travel here,
that's how it works.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.480
Not only are they struggling to
understand what he is telling them

12:11.520 --> 12:14.000
but they haven't
printed their return tickets

12:14.040 --> 12:15.520
for him to inspect.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.560
You're going to
where after here?

12:24.440 --> 12:26.560
Go back to London. And
then where do you go?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.400
What?

12:34.080 --> 12:35.840
Are you living in Taiwan?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.960
You live in both?

12:41.680 --> 12:43.880
Despite the language barrier

12:43.920 --> 12:46.480
and difficulties with
their return ticket...

12:48.360 --> 12:51.120
..Officer lhalley is satisfied
that they are in the country

12:51.160 --> 12:52.520
for the right reasons.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.960
It's back to officer
Danny O'Connell,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.040
who is also checking passports at
Dublin airport. Thanks very much.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.520
Thank you.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.920
Hello. How are ya?

13:09.960 --> 13:12.440
A flight has just
landed from Vienna

13:12.480 --> 13:16.400
and this passenger has
a serious problem. No ID.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.336
You're not gonna like
this. It's a complicated story.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.920
I live here. I just
lost my passport,

13:21.960 --> 13:23.720
my wallet and everything,

13:23.760 --> 13:25.800
basically, in Austria. Ok.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.760
Although he has lost
his documents in Europe,

13:27.800 --> 13:30.120
it is possible to fly
without a passport

13:30.160 --> 13:32.560
if it's lost or stolen
while abroad.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.480
Applying for an emergency
travel document will allow

13:36.520 --> 13:39.600
a one-trip journey to
your final destination.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.360
Having got permission
to travel to Ireland,

13:43.400 --> 13:46.520
officer O'Connell now needs to
prove this passenger's identity

13:46.560 --> 13:49.360
before he can be
let into the country.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.880
This guy knows about it.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.040
Yep. Ok. But I have a
copy of my gnib card.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.200
Perfect. Thanks a million.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.320
And he's got ace up his sleeve.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.560
A photo of his immigration
or gnib card on his phone.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.680
A gnib card is basically the garda
national immigration bureau card

14:07.720 --> 14:10.640
that is issued to non-Europeans.

14:10.680 --> 14:14.160
They might be the partners
of Irish or eu citizens

14:14.200 --> 14:15.880
entitled to live here.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.720
They have to carry
the card at all times.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.880
Not only when travelling
in and out of here,

14:20.920 --> 14:24.320
but also if they're
stopped by a guard

14:24.360 --> 14:26.200
on the streets of Ireland.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.960
So, you rang Kevin earlier?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.920
Well, aer lingus
rang him from Vienna.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.880
Yeah, that's no problem.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.600
Allowing officer O'Connell
to cross-reference

14:37.640 --> 14:39.000
his immigration details

14:39.040 --> 14:43.240
has meant this well-prepared
traveller is on his way home.

14:43.280 --> 14:47.920
I had got an email just to
say that one of my colleagues

14:47.960 --> 14:49.896
had been in touch and
given him permission to travel.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.880
He had a scan of his
gnib card on his phone,

14:52.920 --> 14:54.880
so I was able to check
him out on our system.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.920
This is him here.

14:56.960 --> 15:01.480
And he is legal here, he's
married to an Irish national.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.400
Her details are here, his details
are here, his photograph is here,

15:04.440 --> 15:07.280
so I was satisfied
that his story was true.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.200
And no harm at all to
have your passport -

15:09.240 --> 15:11.520
especially the phones nowadays,

15:11.560 --> 15:16.480
the smartphones and that
- have your passport on it.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.800
If you need a visa, if you're
coming in, have a copy of that,

15:19.840 --> 15:22.320
your gnib, it's no harm.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.040
In December 2017, the
gnib card was phased out

15:26.080 --> 15:29.000
and replaced by the
Irish residence permit,

15:29.040 --> 15:31.200
which carries exactly
the same legal status.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.000
Dublin port is a gateway
to the republic of Ireland.

15:36.040 --> 15:40.360
It's a well-trodden route by
haulage vehicles and tourists alike.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.560
Security measures are in
place to keep everyone safe.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.880
Officers Vinnie marr
and Derek mccauley

15:50.920 --> 15:53.320
are searching for
prohibited items.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.600
Spare containers for fuel,

16:01.640 --> 16:04.680
guns and firearms are
not allowed on-board.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.120
The international
maritime organisation

16:08.160 --> 16:11.480
have developed a code to help
enhance the security of ships

16:11.520 --> 16:13.120
and port facilities.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.680
We're on a level
one at the moment

16:14.720 --> 16:18.520
so we just have to do 5% of all
vehicles coming through the port.

16:18.560 --> 16:23.280
It goes from 5%, 10% and then
it goes up to 100% on level three,

16:23.320 --> 16:26.800
so every port in the country
and the land has to comply.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.760
It might be a low
security risk day

16:30.800 --> 16:32.920
but they're still
looking for other objects

16:32.960 --> 16:36.440
that could be dangerous if
they got into the wrong hands.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.240
Thank you very
much for your time.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.760
You're welcome.
All the best, yeah.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.616
Hey, you want to just
have a quick look at this?

16:44.640 --> 16:46.480
You're not carrying
any firearms?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.120
Any dangerous chemicals?

16:48.160 --> 16:50.760
Anything at all? Or
no weapons anyway.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.080
Well, we've got re-enactment
weapons, which are all blunt.

16:54.120 --> 16:57.720
Re-enactments, yeah?
Re-enactors bring history to life

16:57.760 --> 17:00.080
through performances
of famous battles.

17:00.120 --> 17:04.480
I stopped the guy here in
the summertime and he had -

17:04.520 --> 17:05.800
a samurai sword, it was.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.016
I said, "sorry? Samurai sword?"

17:07.040 --> 17:08.496
He said, "it's nothing
to panic about.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.200
"It's just a prop."

17:11.760 --> 17:14.320
It's this time of the year we
get a lot of re-enactments.

17:14.360 --> 17:17.520
All these people, they
have swords, weapons.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.560
But they're only, you
know, plastic or whatever.

17:20.600 --> 17:24.480
These weapons may be fake
but they still have the potential

17:24.520 --> 17:26.480
to cause severe damage.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.960
So, are these items, like, real?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.480
They're metal re-enactment
swords by they're all blunt.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.800
Oh, right, yeah.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.480
The ones I've ever seen
have only been plastic.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.416
I've never come across
these real ones, you know?

17:40.440 --> 17:42.000
Have you not? No, no, no.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.776
We can see you had them
locked away in a safe, anyway.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.960
That's it. No, that's fine.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.640
You had them locked
and they're bolted.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.200
Yeah, that's brilliant.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.560
Satisfied that the props
are stored securely,

17:57.600 --> 18:00.840
they advise the ship's company
security officer about their find.

18:02.120 --> 18:06.120
Go ahead. Keith, we
have a Mercedes Van here.

18:06.160 --> 18:09.200
He has weapons. Now,
they're re-enactments.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.480
They're in a steel case, it's
bolted to the end of the Van.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.280
If you want to phone the ship in
case they want to maybe locate it

18:15.320 --> 18:17.960
in a different location on the
ship, but they are blunt. Over.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.640
We'll contact our cso

18:24.680 --> 18:27.760
and he'll just inform the
ship what they're carrying.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.160
So we shouldn't really have a
problem but the ship might want

18:31.200 --> 18:32.880
the Van stored in
a separate place.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.456
Thank you very much. We happy?

18:35.480 --> 18:37.640
Yeah, great stuff,
thank you very much.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.440
This time, security have no
axe to grind with this viking

18:41.480 --> 18:43.680
and he lives to
fight another day.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.880
Most of the time,

18:44.920 --> 18:48.400
you're fine and these people
have a reason for having them.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.840
It's always something that
they're either walking with

18:50.880 --> 18:52.896
or they're bringing away on
their holidays to use, you know?

18:52.920 --> 18:56.480
But once it's stored away somewhere
safe, there's no problem with it,

18:56.520 --> 18:57.520
you know, like.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.680
Skirting around Dublin city,

19:03.720 --> 19:06.360
the m50 motorway links
the port to the airport.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.840
It's busy 24 hours a day
and it's vital that drivers

19:11.880 --> 19:13.520
are paying
attention to the road.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.960
Garda traffic corps officers
paddy mcelroy and Philip Earl

19:18.000 --> 19:21.920
are driving an unmarked car,
giving them the upper hand.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.840
They spot a driver using his
mobile phone behind the wheel

19:27.880 --> 19:29.120
and pull him over.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.840
The advantage of
the unmarked car,

19:32.880 --> 19:35.160
obviously for us, is
it's a lot easier for us

19:35.200 --> 19:38.080
to observe what people are
doing and to follow them discreetly.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.616
The disadvantage, of course,
from the public's point of view is that

19:40.640 --> 19:42.240
they don't see the
police presence.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.576
Even though there could be a
large police presence in the area,

19:44.600 --> 19:46.160
they don't see it.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.440
In the wet conditions,

19:48.480 --> 19:51.640
there's no way this driver is
getting away with the offence.

19:51.680 --> 19:55.040
So, this fella's gonna get an fcpn
or a fixed charge penalty notice

19:55.080 --> 19:57.200
sent out to his address,
which carries a fine

19:57.240 --> 19:58.840
of 60 euro and
three penalty points.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.760
If he doesn't pay the
initial fine in 28 days,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.656
it goes up to 90 euro
and three penalty points.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.176
If he doesn't pay that,
it goes to summons.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.720
A conviction in court
is five penalty points.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.680
And it seems to be a day for it.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.536
It's not long before they've
spotted another driver

20:11.560 --> 20:13.760
who can't leave
his handset alone,

20:13.800 --> 20:16.960
except this guy
drives for a living.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.880
It's a taxi, a
professional driver.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.160
So there's no excuse for that.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.040
Just put my
professional jacket on.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.200
In this day and age,

20:29.240 --> 20:31.296
for a professional driver
not to have a hands-free kit

20:31.320 --> 20:32.880
just doesn't make any sense.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.080
The basic 60km an hour,

20:35.120 --> 20:38.920
you're travelling 1km every minute,
so you can imagine those few seconds

20:38.960 --> 20:41.720
of just staring at a phone,
how much road you've covered.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.920
You will literally see people on
the motorways using social media.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.200
It's crazy. It's so distracting.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.480
Like the driver before him,

20:52.520 --> 20:55.040
he's getting a ticket
and three penalty points,

20:55.080 --> 20:56.520
which is really bad news.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.216
This taxi driver that's been
stopped for this mobile phone issue

21:00.240 --> 21:02.256
has stated that he has
nine penalty points already.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.120
If he pays this fine, which
is three penalty points,

21:05.160 --> 21:07.000
it makes it 12
points in a period

21:07.040 --> 21:09.280
where he'll get
disqualified from driving.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.080
It is what it is.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.856
That's the system we
have and that's the system

21:12.880 --> 21:14.240
I'm gonna use.

21:15.360 --> 21:19.400
With nine points already, this
driver is going to be out of a job.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.800
That's one phone call that
was definitely not worth making.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.120
