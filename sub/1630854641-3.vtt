WEBVTT

00:05.433 --> 00:07.266
2.62 ounces.

00:07.266 --> 00:09.900
It's not like, "Yay!"
We're rich.

00:11.033 --> 00:12.233
Ooh.

00:12.233 --> 00:13.667
- Little late.
- Little late, huh?

00:13.667 --> 00:14.767
Got to get it.

00:14.767 --> 00:16.467
Got to do a little better
than that.

00:18.333 --> 00:22.467
10.47 ounces
and it's unacceptable.

00:23.634 --> 00:25.500
This season
has already been a rough ride

00:25.500 --> 00:27.266
for the miners.

00:27.266 --> 00:30.800
Now it's about to go from bad
to worse.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.634
If this rain keeps up,
it's going to put

00:33.634 --> 00:34.900
a hurtin' on us.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.500
The storm
is really putting

00:44.500 --> 00:46.567
a damper on everything.

00:46.567 --> 00:50.066
We're not on the water,
not on the land.

00:50.066 --> 00:53.400
I've never seen this much rain
and known before.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.567
We're going
to call it Fight of the Day.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.233
And so we're all just
here stumbling

01:04.233 --> 01:05.634
around in circles in the rain.

01:05.634 --> 01:08.133
It's just frustrating.
I don't know what to do.

01:08.133 --> 01:10.700
Just like struggling
really hard to, like,

01:10.700 --> 01:12.066
not be depressed.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.900
Right now, one
of the skips are flipped over.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.967
Ninety percent
of the time, when you see

01:20.967 --> 01:23.333
a boat flipped over like that,
someone's dying.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.700
But look at it.
If there was somebody
dead right now,

01:25.700 --> 01:27.600
the ambulance would be here.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.700
Every time you go out there
in bad weather,

01:29.700 --> 01:31.734
you're taking your life
in your own hands.

01:44.233 --> 01:48.333
Days of relentless
rain have started to subside.

01:48.333 --> 01:51.367
But rough currents,
the limited visibility

01:51.367 --> 01:55.900
below leave few options
for a battered fleet

01:55.900 --> 01:57.800
desperate to return to mining.

02:08.533 --> 02:10.467
Bad things can happen
in this harbor if you're just

02:10.467 --> 02:11.934
leaving your boat anchored.

02:11.934 --> 02:13.634
It's like

02:13.634 --> 02:15.000
With rising waves,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.767
Zeke Tenhoff isn't taking
any chances.

02:18.767 --> 02:20.834
I'm gonna take the boat
across the harbor,

02:20.834 --> 02:22.834
and I'm gonna
pull the boat out.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.667
I've got a killer deal going
with Shawn.

02:24.667 --> 02:27.033
He's letting me and my brother
take the Havilah out

02:27.033 --> 02:29.300
on the Tomcord
later this summer.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.634
In order to be
as efficient as possible,

02:31.634 --> 02:33.634
I'm prospecting around
with this little boat.

02:33.634 --> 02:35.967
I made so that we'll know
where the good ground is.

02:35.967 --> 02:37.967
But there's no way to do
that with the currents,

02:37.967 --> 02:39.600
how they are right now,
it's not even safe

02:39.600 --> 02:41.300
to keep the boat on the water.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.900
The weather this summer
is not improving.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.533
I have to, like,
reset kind of

02:47.533 --> 02:49.667
and just like,
take the boat out
because if the wind gets

02:49.667 --> 02:51.500
really strong
and then the storm surge

02:51.500 --> 02:55.033
comes up, it stops
being like a safe place

02:55.033 --> 02:56.233
for your boat to live.

02:56.233 --> 02:57.533
I just need to park it.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.634
We've already
lost days.

03:01.634 --> 03:04.867
If these conditions continue
like this
for very much longer,

03:04.867 --> 03:06.734
it's just going to ruin
the season for me.

03:07.934 --> 03:09.500
It'll be a total bust.

03:10.266 --> 03:12.567
We're good. We got it.

03:12.567 --> 03:16.667
And I'm just going to, like,
leave the boat out until...

03:17.667 --> 03:19.133
the weather gets
a little better.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.767
As Zeke retreats
for the safety of shore...

03:28.000 --> 03:29.467
Forecast
doesn't look great.

03:29.467 --> 03:30.934
So just step out,

03:30.934 --> 03:33.400
get a lay of the land,
see what the swirl is like.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.233
One captain,
despite the fierce winds,

03:36.233 --> 03:38.800
is still determined to get
a firsthand look

03:38.800 --> 03:40.333
before throwing in the towel.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.867
To play down enough,
we will take the boat out.

03:44.634 --> 03:46.634
Mining in the Bering Sea
is complicated.

03:46.634 --> 03:48.734
You invest tons of money.

03:48.734 --> 03:52.200
You have to find tons of gold
to be profitable.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.367
But the Bering Sea
doesn't care

03:54.367 --> 03:55.800
about any of that.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.300
There are going to be days
where the Bering Sea makes it

03:58.300 --> 03:59.934
impossible to mine.

03:59.934 --> 04:01.934
And if there's too many
of those days,

04:01.934 --> 04:03.567
you're going to lose
your opportunity

04:03.567 --> 04:05.100
and lose all your money.

04:06.133 --> 04:07.567
So you have to use
your best judgment.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.634
And sometimes you just
have to dig your heels in

04:09.634 --> 04:10.734
and go for it.

04:12.233 --> 04:13.667
It's not just
about your vessel

04:13.667 --> 04:15.233
being seaworthy or not.

04:15.233 --> 04:17.700
The boat's going like this.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.700
It's really making it
impossible for the diver

04:19.700 --> 04:22.533
to stay and work the ground
and the--

04:22.533 --> 04:24.734
You know, put gold
in this new spot.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.900
We got a rough boat.

04:32.834 --> 04:35.634
We got some pretty,
pretty good swells.

04:38.934 --> 04:42.400
I'm determined to hit
250 ounces this summer.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.834
I will have a family and build
a legacy, and it will take

04:44.834 --> 04:46.533
at least that much.

04:46.533 --> 04:48.266
I really want
to risk it today,

04:48.266 --> 04:51.934
but I have to be honest,
it's too dangerous.

04:51.934 --> 04:54.200
What this weather could do
to the Eroica,

04:54.200 --> 04:55.900
it'll cost me more
in the long run.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.367
Oh, man.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.100
It's pretty choppy out there.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.400
Back in town...

05:21.533 --> 05:23.233
Okay. It was the first
hard cleanup.

05:23.233 --> 05:25.934
Our numbers were not
where we need to be.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.634
The rough sea
conditions threatened

05:27.634 --> 05:31.166
to derail the fledgling
Reaper Nation even further.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.667
But they're not going down
without a fight.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.467
I know we're not going
to fail.

05:37.467 --> 05:38.767
We just need to push hard.

05:38.767 --> 05:41.500
We need to stick together
and we need to make this work.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.867
And I know we can do it.

05:42.867 --> 05:45.233
Keep our heads in the game
and let's not get bummed out.

05:45.233 --> 05:46.467
The gold is gonna come.

05:46.467 --> 05:48.233
Okay, everybody, give me
some [bleep] fist love.

05:48.233 --> 05:50.000
Yeah, baby.
Let's make it happen.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.834
And I know it's going
to work out, okay?

05:51.834 --> 05:53.100
- We need it.
- Okay.

05:56.767 --> 05:58.800
This season
has not really gone the way

05:58.800 --> 06:00.266
I thought it was going to.

06:00.266 --> 06:01.767
Not even close.

06:03.233 --> 06:04.967
We need to turn everything
around fast.

06:04.967 --> 06:07.200
But right now, Mother Nature
is trying to screw me.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.867
It is starting
to blow up a little bit
like the wind

06:13.867 --> 06:16.033
starting to pick up
a little bit, you guys.

06:16.033 --> 06:17.900
I just want to make sure
everybody's safe.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.967
We could be pushing it,
but like,

06:19.967 --> 06:22.367
aren't we kind of at that
point where we got it?

06:22.367 --> 06:24.634
- We have to push it.
- We got to push it like...

06:24.634 --> 06:26.300
That's why I want
Kris to make the call.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.467
Hey, we're going.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.433
And I know I'm pushing
to get out there.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.700
Do you want me
to lift the spud?

06:46.567 --> 06:47.700
Stand by.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.934
No one in Nome is going out
in these conditions

06:51.934 --> 06:54.133
except for us.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.500
We owe $125,000
at the end of the month,

06:56.500 --> 06:58.834
or the Mistress is probably
gonna get repossessed.

07:00.066 --> 07:02.266
So even though
this is a [bleep] situation

07:02.266 --> 07:05.333
we're still going mining,
we don't have a choice.

07:07.033 --> 07:08.200
Yeah. We're ready.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.166
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.166
- Okay, let's go.
- All right.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.934
Right now
we're underway

07:17.934 --> 07:19.233
with the Mistress.

07:19.233 --> 07:21.533
We're going into a little bit
of a bad weather situation,

07:21.533 --> 07:23.433
but I don't get it
at this point,

07:23.433 --> 07:24.567
I know the boat can handle it.

07:24.567 --> 07:26.433
I know my crew's trained well enough.

07:26.433 --> 07:28.100
I know we're going
to make money today.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.400
I know it.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.367
A little bit of waves.

07:40.367 --> 07:41.800
That's not going to stop us
right now.

07:50.266 --> 07:51.800
And that currents.
Where you've been?

07:57.667 --> 08:00.500
That right there is bigger
than it seems.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.166
It's a little rougher
than we thought

08:02.166 --> 08:03.433
when we came out here.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.600
So this is the point
of no return.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.400
Do you want to go back
or do you want to keep going?

08:13.400 --> 08:14.867
Nobody's mining

08:14.867 --> 08:16.166
that we're going to work.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.066
Everybody else wants
to stay in.

08:18.066 --> 08:19.200
Not us.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.900
We're gonna get
what we can and go.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.667
Okay, full steam ahead.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.533
Well, we'll work
full steam in the head.

08:24.533 --> 08:25.800
Okay. Beautiful.

08:33.133 --> 08:35.367
Okay, Well, the waves
are bigger than I thought.

08:37.467 --> 08:39.500
But so is the amount of money
we still owe.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.233
Today we're going to find out
what the Mistress can take.

08:42.233 --> 08:43.967
If not, we're going
to the bottom

08:43.967 --> 08:45.934
of the Bering Sea
one way or another.

08:54.266 --> 08:56.767
So the last time
I was anywhere near

08:56.767 --> 08:58.200
the spot was in 2018.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.533
And we were doing good.

08:59.533 --> 09:03.033
But I had a million breakdown,
so I really didn't get

09:03.033 --> 09:04.834
to finish this area.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.600
Well, that's prospecting.
So let's start.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.300
Yeah, let's just give
it a shot.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.533
Okay. I think
this is a great spot to start.

09:13.934 --> 09:15.900
Get ready to drop a spud.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.533
Dropping.

09:23.433 --> 09:24.600
Both of them are down.

09:28.166 --> 09:30.266
This [bleep] wind
is picking up again.

09:30.266 --> 09:31.867
We're taking waves
from the side.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.000
Hope I made the right call
right now.

09:37.834 --> 09:42.433
So this isn't exactly
ideal taking swells, you know,

09:42.433 --> 09:44.100
they're just broadsiding us.

09:46.367 --> 09:49.700
So right now, this is [bleep].

09:59.734 --> 10:01.100
Okay, This is nuts.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.266
The winds are so high.

10:02.266 --> 10:03.867
We're having trouble putting
the spuds down

10:03.867 --> 10:05.500
and getting into position.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.834
That's pretty crazy.

10:08.367 --> 10:09.567
It's not gonna work.

10:19.433 --> 10:21.000
What are we doing?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.133
We've got two options,

10:22.133 --> 10:26.133
like in motor is out deeper,
drop a spud,

10:26.133 --> 10:29.500
get out of the trough,
or we can save the views

10:29.500 --> 10:32.333
on the barge and motoring.

10:32.333 --> 10:33.900
So you think it's too rough
to dig, though?

10:34.900 --> 10:36.066
Yeah.

10:36.066 --> 10:37.667
There's a reason
why no one else is out.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.200
It's looking like
we should motor in.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.600
So maybe it was a bad idea,
a waste of time.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.500
It's not possible to do
any mining.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.400
Not now.
Not in these conditions.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.867
So we're going down
the tubes fast at this point.

10:52.867 --> 10:55.767
It is time
to get out of here.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.634
We had our shot,
we couldn't make it work.

11:00.634 --> 11:02.133
And that's it.

11:02.133 --> 11:03.967
We'll come back tomorrow
morning at 10:00

11:03.967 --> 11:05.500
and do it again.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.066
Desperation makes you
do [bleep] things.

11:09.066 --> 11:10.367
Do you know what I'm saying?

11:22.066 --> 11:25.433
When the weather's good,
we're all on water.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.734
But the weather is keeping us
off the water.

11:27.734 --> 11:30.700
So here we are
at the inland mine.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.934
Here comes the haul truck.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.000
One of the key things
to keep an operation

11:42.000 --> 11:44.033
this big running is diversity.

11:44.033 --> 11:47.700
Sure, I got my baby, the CR,
the Money Merle,

11:47.700 --> 11:49.433
and soon the Havilah.

11:49.433 --> 11:51.333
But I also have
the Inland Mine.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.500
It's a monster.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.700
It makes a ton of gold,

11:53.700 --> 11:55.734
but it's way more costly
to operate.

11:55.734 --> 11:59.000
And it takes up
way more resources.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.634
The biggest thing
on the inland

12:00.634 --> 12:03.100
is keeping everything running.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.667
Offshore you got
a water pump, an excavator,

12:05.667 --> 12:06.867
and a wash plant.

12:06.867 --> 12:12.066
Inland, you got dozers,
excavators, haul trucks,

12:12.066 --> 12:16.133
wash plants, water pumps,
dewatering pumps.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.734
And you burn a lot more fuel.

12:18.734 --> 12:22.133
So in order to keep
this operation going,

12:22.133 --> 12:24.700
you got to keep everything
greased and groomed

12:24.700 --> 12:27.166
and oiled and ready
to rock and roll.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.700
It is a lot to maintain.

12:33.967 --> 12:37.934
Hopefully, all this works out
because it's a big gamble.

12:37.934 --> 12:40.667
But with big gambles come
big rewards.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.867
I've been looking at an area
called Cooper Gulch,

12:48.867 --> 12:51.634
which I'm betting is going
to be our next hotspot.

12:51.634 --> 12:54.133
This is Cooper Gulch here.

12:54.133 --> 12:57.200
This is all been mined
by the old-timers.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.266
They didn't get it all, though.

12:59.266 --> 13:03.934
For some reason, they missed
this little area right here.

13:04.934 --> 13:08.066
And with the way,
the price of gold is at...

13:09.333 --> 13:10.800
we're gonna get after it.

13:13.266 --> 13:16.300
Inland mining is nothing
like mining on the ocean.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.500
We're going after the same
type of material,

13:18.500 --> 13:21.166
but in the inland,
you have to move

13:21.166 --> 13:24.567
a mountain of overburden
to get to the pay.

13:24.567 --> 13:28.767
And once you're to the pay,
then you bring it
to the wash plant.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.300
If you're wrong,
you burn a ton of money.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.634
It'll hurt big.

13:32.634 --> 13:34.934
But if you're right,
it pays off big.

13:40.634 --> 13:42.233
Let's go get this cut started.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.734
I'm pretty excited
to see

13:52.734 --> 13:54.834
what's at the bottom
of this cut here.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.600
Could be a little bit.
Could be a lot.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.200
We are hoping for a lot.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.867
Shawn's not
the only member of the fleet

14:04.867 --> 14:06.467
working off the water.

14:10.667 --> 14:11.834
With damp weather,

14:11.834 --> 14:14.133
I can't stand being
around Nome

14:14.133 --> 14:16.200
and not being able to
get out to dredge.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.467
Yeah.

14:17.467 --> 14:20.433
With the Bering Sea
off limits, Vernon Adkison

14:20.433 --> 14:24.266
is on the hunt to somehow
keep the gold coming in.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.233
Today, it's just
a scouting expedition.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.233
And I've been
interested in this claim

14:30.233 --> 14:32.300
for several years now.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.500
I think the time is right
to go check them out.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.767
And these claims,

14:36.767 --> 14:39.333
I've got it from several
government sources

14:39.333 --> 14:41.033
that they're good.

14:41.033 --> 14:42.934
Here's the thing.

14:42.934 --> 14:45.967
I'm looking to build
a gold-filled kingdom,

14:45.967 --> 14:48.900
not some rinky-dink operation.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.667
Mother Nature is not making
that easy right now.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.467
So I'm looking inland.

14:54.467 --> 14:55.767
Way inland,

14:55.767 --> 14:58.667
like 80 miles
from town to inland.

14:58.667 --> 15:02.100
I've got to lead on some
potentially hot river claims.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.634
Well, you never know
if it's true.

15:03.634 --> 15:06.400
It could be someone just
yanking your chain.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.400
My lady one,
we're almost there.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.200
Can you smell that gold?

15:15.200 --> 15:17.400
Yeah, I can.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.934
That's gonna be exciting.

15:21.033 --> 15:22.533
There it is.
The end of the world.

15:24.233 --> 15:26.033
Well, it might not
be the end of the world,

15:26.033 --> 15:29.467
but it's pretty much
the end of the road.

15:29.467 --> 15:33.300
This is the last bridge
on Kougarok Road.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.467
You sure, it's safe?

15:36.100 --> 15:37.834
We could wind up
in the river.

15:37.834 --> 15:39.700
We'll find out. Won't we?

15:39.700 --> 15:41.834
You know,
it's one of those...

15:41.834 --> 15:44.200
you're taking your life
in your hands.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.367
But just...

15:46.266 --> 15:47.800
This place's to hell and gone.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.834
The Kougarok is about
as far as anybody

15:49.834 --> 15:51.033
in Nome goes.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.367
Maybe even further.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.500
It's a pain in the rough
getting out of here.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.100
So it better be worth it.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.233
So it's gonna be right
down here little ways.

16:06.634 --> 16:12.433
So from here, it's about
1,200 feet down
to the river...

16:13.600 --> 16:16.500
2,000 feet to the claims.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.600
Once we get down here
for 3000 feet,

16:18.600 --> 16:19.934
that's half a mile.

16:21.734 --> 16:23.166
It's gonna be a hike
down there.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.133
And I doubt my knee
is gonna hold up.

16:26.133 --> 16:29.634
But I'm saying, let's take
a walk down this trail awaits.

16:29.634 --> 16:30.767
All right.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.900
I want to get my eye
on these river clams.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.467
I want to see how much trouble
it's going to be to get

16:42.467 --> 16:45.066
the equipment
in and if it's even worth it.

16:45.967 --> 16:48.133
These remote things can get dodgy.

16:49.266 --> 16:50.900
And the last thing
I want to do

16:50.900 --> 16:52.934
is to make some big effort
to get out here,

16:52.934 --> 16:54.600
and then take it
in the shorts.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.767
The owner says
there's a little bit of a hike

16:59.767 --> 17:01.133
getting down there.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.734
So we'll see.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.867
I think the trail gets
pretty muddy on down,

17:04.867 --> 17:06.200
but we'll walk away.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.533
Well, see if it's gonna be
a global thing.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.000
I don't know what the hell
he would tell me.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.767
A couple of hundred yards,
my ass.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.100
No way.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.000
I don't think
we're gonna make it
all the way there.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.500
All right.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.166
Anyway, there the claim is--

17:35.166 --> 17:38.734
Where that sandbar is
is where the claims start.

17:38.734 --> 17:40.433
And if you'll notice,
over on this side,

17:40.433 --> 17:41.700
there are two pieces
of equipment,

17:41.700 --> 17:45.433
an excavator and a trommel.

17:45.433 --> 17:48.533
And that's what the claim
owner told me,

17:48.533 --> 17:50.600
that he thought his partner
had left something there.

17:50.600 --> 17:55.533
So we get back
and launch the drone

17:55.533 --> 17:57.100
and take a good close look
at it.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.233
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be.

17:58.233 --> 18:00.166
- Yeah.
- That'd be great.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.734
To hell with walking
down there.

18:01.734 --> 18:03.600
I'm going to get a drone
in the air

18:03.600 --> 18:06.467
and get a full overhead view
of what we're getting into.

18:06.467 --> 18:08.066
So I know
what I'm dealing with.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.767
It's better to rely
on technology
if you've got it.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.867
And that's kind of
my specialty anyway.

18:17.900 --> 18:21.533
No, that ain't good.

18:21.533 --> 18:22.834
Fire it up, Bryan.

18:26.433 --> 18:27.634
Go.

18:30.233 --> 18:32.300
Okay, so check out
that equipment shift.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.333
That's a mini excavator
and a trommel.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.033
There it is.
There's an excavator
and a trommel.

18:43.033 --> 18:44.367
That definitely is.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.400
Check the other bank.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.867
Check the bank on this side.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.567
I like it.

18:58.567 --> 18:59.734
Yeah. Yeah.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.033
This site
does look promising.

19:04.033 --> 19:06.533
It's wide and relatively deep.

19:06.533 --> 19:09.867
There's a flat ground
where we can park
the equipment.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.767
I think it's worth giving it
a shot,

19:11.767 --> 19:13.533
especially
with the sea conditions.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.600
So we'll get the team down
here tomorrow

19:16.600 --> 19:18.934
if the weather
is still not cooperating

19:18.934 --> 19:20.166
and get to work.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.834
All right, Well, good enough.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.066
Let's get the hell
out of here.

19:26.066 --> 19:27.700
I don't know what the hell
he was telling me.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.800
A couple of hundred yards,
my ass.

19:31.634 --> 19:33.400
Kind of makes me wonder
if the guy's ever actually

19:33.400 --> 19:35.066
even been down here himself.

19:35.066 --> 19:36.600
Yeah.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.900
A new dawn
on the Bering Sea.

19:52.333 --> 19:53.634
And as the day starts...

19:54.667 --> 19:56.533
the gods refused
to cooperate.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.100
As currents pick up steam
on the high seas.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.233
Where do you guys
want to launch the boat
over right here?

20:07.233 --> 20:08.567
Right here.

20:08.567 --> 20:11.100
Yeah. We've got
to take it over
to the other side.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.266
Well, conditions
are too rough to mine.

20:13.266 --> 20:14.367
One, two, three.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.400
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.133
There's potentially
good news for Captain Kris.

20:19.133 --> 20:20.467
We're good.

20:20.467 --> 20:22.667
The new
and improved Reaper is ready

20:22.667 --> 20:25.533
to be tested in the calm
waters of the harbor.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.567
That's plowing down.

20:28.567 --> 20:30.200
This trailer
is a hunk of [bleep].

20:30.200 --> 20:33.567
And the pontoon...

20:33.567 --> 20:35.767
Sea conditions suck,
we can't mind.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.300
And if this continues,
we're probably

20:37.300 --> 20:39.400
going to lose everything.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.934
But my dad and brother
finally got

20:40.934 --> 20:42.934
the work done on the Reaper.

20:42.934 --> 20:44.133
So we're going to try it out.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.000
Make sure
they didn't screw up anything.

20:47.367 --> 20:48.700
The boat's good to go.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.533
Moving forward,
this will be a big part
of the Reaper's success.

20:52.634 --> 20:53.867
Load them Kev.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.333
Grinds.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.634
God, that's a terrible sound.

21:01.667 --> 21:02.900
Stop right there, Kev.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.133
That's how
the professionals do it, baby.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.000
Okay, let's go.
Start her up.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.734
Is it not starting?

21:23.734 --> 21:25.200
No, it's not.

21:26.033 --> 21:27.100
Oh, this is great.

21:28.734 --> 21:30.133
What happened, Andy?

21:30.133 --> 21:31.934
I don't know.
My dad's in there
with it.

21:35.967 --> 21:37.967
You guys need
to make it work.

21:37.967 --> 21:40.033
The boat should have been
in the water a week ago.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.934
I'm not really understanding
how he's not getting it.

21:44.333 --> 21:45.834
We got the boat in the water

21:45.834 --> 21:47.533
and the outboard
is not running.

21:47.533 --> 21:48.967
So I don't know
what's going on,

21:48.967 --> 21:50.834
but I know I've got
other [bleep] things to do.

21:58.433 --> 22:00.533
You're not going
to get it.

22:00.533 --> 22:02.033
What's going on?

22:02.033 --> 22:04.500
It just-- It's not starting.
I'm choking it.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.100
Hey, let's bring it out
of the water

22:06.100 --> 22:07.567
because we're not making
this work.

22:07.567 --> 22:09.433
Let's get this
thing out of here.

22:09.433 --> 22:11.934
Yeah. Great job.

22:11.934 --> 22:16.333
So, shocker of all shockers,
I give my dad and brother
one simple job,

22:16.333 --> 22:18.000
get the Reaper ready to mine,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.100
and they completely
face-planted.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.834
I should
have known better.

22:21.834 --> 22:24.367
The problem is I need
this boat working this summer

22:24.367 --> 22:25.600
if I'm going
to have any chance

22:25.600 --> 22:27.266
of Reaper Nation surviving.

22:27.266 --> 22:30.166
So this might sink us
if I can't fix it.

22:33.266 --> 22:34.700
Dad. Dad!

22:34.700 --> 22:36.367
You need to stop.

22:36.367 --> 22:38.700
You guys all.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.333
You need to get off my boat.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.166
You guys all.

22:42.166 --> 22:44.667
I already see how
this season's going to go,
dude. It's so great.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.600
Let me call Chris
and see if there's a trick

22:46.600 --> 22:48.400
that we have to do
to start this.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.734
My dad and brother clearly
have no idea

22:50.734 --> 22:52.367
what they're doing.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.934
We bought the engine
secondhand from Chris McCully,

22:54.934 --> 22:57.867
so hopefully, he can get
in here and get it working.

22:57.867 --> 23:00.533
Here he comes now. McCully.

23:00.533 --> 23:02.533
Hey, I tried
to get it started, but...

23:02.533 --> 23:04.600
- What happened?
- It just
turns over, bro.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.734
You got to put it on neutral.
You got to rev it up.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.367
Do you remember
I told you that?

23:09.367 --> 23:10.800
Try to get it
going right now.

23:19.433 --> 23:20.867
That thing is in running.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.433
Good job buddy.

23:23.433 --> 23:25.367
Let's get this in the water.

23:25.367 --> 23:26.634
So that's all it took.

23:26.634 --> 23:28.333
My dad and brother
are useless.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.367
Okay. Let's go.

23:41.834 --> 23:42.867
We're going.

23:42.867 --> 23:44.634
I don't feel good secure
driving it,

23:44.634 --> 23:46.467
but we're driving it.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.734
Do you know what I mean?

23:47.734 --> 23:49.367
Yeah, baby.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.333
The Reaper is alive.

23:53.333 --> 23:56.000
And with that payment coming,
thank God.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.100
We just need the weather
to clear up so we can get

23:58.100 --> 23:59.800
all of Reaper Nation
on the water

23:59.800 --> 24:01.233
so we can make big money.

24:02.734 --> 24:03.867
Oh, yeah.

24:05.100 --> 24:07.033
Yeah, everything
is done. Ready to go.

24:07.033 --> 24:08.600
The boat sits perfectly
in the water

24:08.600 --> 24:09.967
with all the weight on it.

24:09.967 --> 24:11.333
I'm happy with this.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.233
Next Wednesday,
we will go get gold.

24:14.233 --> 24:15.634
Yep.

24:15.634 --> 24:18.333
As the new Reaper
finally springs to life.

24:21.133 --> 24:22.834
On the other side
of the harbor.

24:22.834 --> 24:24.800
Let's get
this thing loaded up, guys.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.467
Get on down the road.

24:26.467 --> 24:28.600
The Kougarok is waiting
for us.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.533
Vernon Adkison prepares

24:30.533 --> 24:33.266
for a long day's journey
to the Kougarok River.

24:33.266 --> 24:36.900
We're all loaded up
with our prospecting dredge.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.800
We got a four-wheeler,
a trailer,

24:39.800 --> 24:40.967
some other equipment.

24:40.967 --> 24:43.533
Going back to Kougarok...

24:43.533 --> 24:47.667
and we got
the dredge out there
and start prospecting.

24:47.667 --> 24:50.233
Yeah, that's good.
That's good.

24:50.233 --> 24:51.767
All right.
Let's get out of here.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.600
These conditions
can turn on a dime,

24:55.600 --> 24:58.266
especially
in the next two days.

24:58.266 --> 25:00.166
It might be good
for a few hours,

25:00.166 --> 25:02.166
and then they'll turn
to garbage.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.166
That's why we're looking
for an inland claim

25:04.166 --> 25:07.500
that we can call home
and go to any time.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.934
Hopefully, that'll be
the verdict with Kougarok,

25:09.934 --> 25:12.867
because it's a major trek
getting out there.

25:19.533 --> 25:21.634
We'd see
supposed gold.

25:21.634 --> 25:23.200
We'll bring out a bigger rig.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.367
Sweet.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.967
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

25:27.967 --> 25:30.533
And I'm kicking a square
in the ass.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.834
Suck up to make some gold,
that's what I'm looking for.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.800
Damn.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.900
Get off the road.

25:39.967 --> 25:43.000
Got him going
at 22 miles an hour.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.300
He's doing a haul ass.

25:46.767 --> 25:48.367
Get along little doggie.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.700
Maybe he took up a little jog
down the highway,

25:52.700 --> 25:54.066
We'll slow him down
to nothing.

25:54.066 --> 25:56.634
Get out there
and ride his ass.

25:56.634 --> 25:59.967
I mean, he got
the entire state of Alaska
on the left and the right,

26:00.066 --> 26:02.800
but he's choosing to run down
the middle of the road.

26:06.467 --> 26:08.400
Oh, there he goes.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.667
Goodbye, little buddy.

26:31.567 --> 26:34.233
I don't think people realize
the amount of equipment,

26:34.233 --> 26:37.533
effort, and time it takes
to dredge for gold.

26:37.533 --> 26:38.667
Let's go.

26:39.934 --> 26:41.033
Come on.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.100
Even in the little
river, it still takes

26:43.100 --> 26:45.634
a decent-sized operation.

26:45.634 --> 26:49.600
And all that had to be
transported over 80 miles.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.800
Hopefully, we're only a few
steps away from being set up.

26:54.233 --> 26:55.734
The thing,
looking good?

27:00.567 --> 27:02.467
Oh.

27:02.467 --> 27:04.000
Hey.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.233
That didn't work.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.934
Oh, there goes that idea.

27:19.166 --> 27:20.667
that, man.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.133
Damn it.

27:22.133 --> 27:23.200
You know...

27:26.033 --> 27:27.634
Don't [bleep] with me
right now.

27:27.634 --> 27:29.233
I don't even know
if there's gold

27:29.233 --> 27:31.200
in this damn place.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.233
We've been working at it
for two days,

27:33.233 --> 27:36.000
and now we got
a wheeler stuck.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.133
This is slowly turning
into a clutter [bleep].

27:39.133 --> 27:41.600
I'm beginning to wonder
if this mission is a curse.

27:51.066 --> 27:52.233
All right.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.967
Finally, two days.

28:00.266 --> 28:01.834
240 miles.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.100
I got it.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.033
And I don't know how many
tons of equipment

28:06.033 --> 28:07.433
were transported later.

28:08.634 --> 28:09.900
That won't go anywhere.

28:12.767 --> 28:15.467
We're finally ready to get
a body in the water and see

28:15.467 --> 28:17.200
if there's any damn gold here.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.166
That water is freezing cold.

28:19.166 --> 28:23.000
It's like literally ice water.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.600
The water in the ocean
is pretty warm throughout,

28:25.600 --> 28:29.567
48 degrees just up here at 34,
a couple of degrees

28:29.567 --> 28:31.033
above freezing.

28:31.033 --> 28:33.100
Well, Bryan, look here.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.500
I don't want you
to go hypothermic.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.667
You just stay out there.

28:36.667 --> 28:39.667
And when you get--
when you start getting

28:39.667 --> 28:41.433
You just come out
and get warm.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.767
Maybe
he can get the...

28:47.967 --> 28:49.467
...water warming
up the sick guys,

28:49.467 --> 28:51.000
but at least get his toes warm.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.133
The thing about it
is that once your feet go

28:54.133 --> 28:55.800
right after that,
your brain goes.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.000
You go hypothermic.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.066
Yeah. Bryan's got some
hot water now.

29:04.066 --> 29:06.967
So he's the man of the moment.

29:06.967 --> 29:08.600
I mean, that water
right there

29:08.600 --> 29:11.066
is way colder than the water
in the ocean right now.

29:13.533 --> 29:15.300
That damn Bryan
is a polar bear.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.400
On the Bering Sea.

29:29.967 --> 29:32.767
For the first time
in five days,

29:32.767 --> 29:35.300
Mother Nature
may be giving the miners

29:35.300 --> 29:36.567
a short break
in the weather.

29:39.166 --> 29:41.333
Holly. Come here.
Holly, come here.

29:41.333 --> 29:42.467
Come here.

29:42.467 --> 29:44.200
Come on.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.800
Yeah, you did it.

29:47.433 --> 29:49.800
Good girl. You're a champion.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.700
Good girl.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.266
And after being
turned back

29:53.266 --> 29:54.867
by rough seas yesterday...

29:56.667 --> 29:59.834
The weather's good
again for a bit.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.834
The visibility
should be improving.

30:01.834 --> 30:04.767
Emily Riedel
is doggedly jumping

30:04.767 --> 30:07.700
at Mother Nature's
sudden opportunity.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.600
We've got to really
take advantage of this good

30:09.600 --> 30:12.767
weather window, so we'll get
out there and see

30:12.767 --> 30:13.967
how she rolls.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.367
We got a good window here

30:18.367 --> 30:19.900
and we're not going
to waste time,

30:19.900 --> 30:21.700
so we're going
to get two dives in

30:21.700 --> 30:23.567
and make up
for the lost time.

30:23.567 --> 30:25.467
When the Bering Sea
throws you a curveball,

30:25.467 --> 30:26.667
you just have to adjust.

30:26.667 --> 30:27.867
and that's what
we're gonna do.

30:31.934 --> 30:33.300
It's nice out.
And it's swelly.

30:35.934 --> 30:37.734
I bring in a new... Rick,

30:37.734 --> 30:39.100
a new diver for the boat.

30:40.533 --> 30:41.700
Here's Rick.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.400
I got to send Rick down
and see

30:43.400 --> 30:44.800
what we're working with.

30:46.567 --> 30:47.767
I don't need another diva.

30:47.767 --> 30:49.867
I just need someone
to get us on the gold

30:49.867 --> 30:52.367
so the next driver
can guzzle it up.

30:52.367 --> 30:53.900
Fingers crossed.
He's a good hire.

31:19.934 --> 31:21.467
Hey, what's up, Rick?

31:22.533 --> 31:23.900
Kind of dark down here.

31:26.533 --> 31:28.433
Pretty clear, but dark.

31:28.433 --> 31:30.400
Just dark.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.567
Yeah. Roger that.

31:34.266 --> 31:36.700
No. We need
to get some gold, man.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.100
All right, Roger. Roger.

31:55.567 --> 31:57.300
Okay, copy that.

32:04.433 --> 32:06.100
[bleep] Yeah.
That's awesome, dude.

32:09.033 --> 32:10.233
That sounds good.

32:11.767 --> 32:13.100
This is what I wanted to hear.

32:13.100 --> 32:16.367
These old timers are amazing
at sniffing out
untouched ground.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.133
And that's exactly
what Rick did.

32:18.133 --> 32:19.667
Now we're off and running.

32:20.734 --> 32:22.967
Trying to make the most out
of good weather.

32:24.033 --> 32:25.934
God willing.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.533
Soon, though,
Emily's dredge

32:33.533 --> 32:35.233
will not be the only one
at work.

32:40.300 --> 32:41.433
It looks like
good weather.

32:41.433 --> 32:44.233
So might as well bring
the boat over to the lawn,

32:44.233 --> 32:46.233
tramp over on the other side
of the harbor.

32:46.233 --> 32:47.834
You're back in the water.

32:47.834 --> 32:50.634
Zeke Tenhoff
is ready to join the fun.

32:52.467 --> 32:55.266
And rush onto the water
with his personally

32:55.266 --> 32:56.600
constructed dredge.

32:57.634 --> 32:59.533
So, I mean,
I'm going to go out there.

32:59.533 --> 33:03.100
I'm going to get six or seven
hours, get a bunch of gold.

33:03.100 --> 33:04.700
It's heartbreaking
that we've been pushed off

33:04.700 --> 33:06.433
the water as long
as we have.

33:06.433 --> 33:09.133
The good news is that
the wind has died down,

33:09.133 --> 33:10.700
the visibility is improving.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.467
And I finally got a chance
to get out there

33:12.467 --> 33:13.800
and get some more gold.

33:13.800 --> 33:14.967
And I'm going to take it.

33:14.967 --> 33:16.300
We're ready to go.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.200
Get out and do
some mining here.

33:22.433 --> 33:23.600
I've got to get out
on the water

33:23.600 --> 33:25.100
before the weather changes again.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.533
Steve is MIA.

33:27.533 --> 33:29.700
So, I'm going to have to bring
in a new tender

33:29.700 --> 33:30.834
on short notice.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.066
It's not just anyone.

33:32.066 --> 33:34.200
It's my girlfriend, Lexi.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.734
Some might say
that bringing your girlfriend

33:41.734 --> 33:45.000
into a work situation
is unwise.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.266
And judging by the history
I have had with this,

33:48.266 --> 33:50.166
they would have a point.

33:50.166 --> 33:52.500
You can just clarify
what it's like,

33:52.500 --> 33:53.934
what the nature
of our relationship is.

33:53.934 --> 33:55.333
It's gotten personal.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.867
You said you're gonna come up

33:56.867 --> 33:59.467
and burn my [bleep] house
down with me in it.

33:59.467 --> 34:02.133
Come on. You know,
calm down [bleep] on.

34:02.133 --> 34:04.100
All right. It's been nice
working with you.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.100
I'm hoping that this time
it works out better

34:06.100 --> 34:07.900
having my girlfriend
on the boat.

34:15.266 --> 34:17.567
Good to go. Perfect.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.200
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.200
It's like shavings
on your head.

34:38.934 --> 34:40.166
Well, good luck.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.300
I'm really excited.

34:44.700 --> 34:45.800
I'm on the bottom.

34:57.667 --> 34:59.900
I don't have any suction
at all.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.467
Turn the pumps
all the way up.

35:03.467 --> 35:05.667
So I have enough suction
to dig this hole.

35:05.667 --> 35:06.800
All right.

35:08.266 --> 35:09.734
Coming right up.

35:25.233 --> 35:26.500
Yes.

35:26.500 --> 35:27.667
Is it better?

35:27.667 --> 35:29.900
Okay, yeah.
That's better.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.200
Thanks.

35:32.834 --> 35:34.967
It's just like
a little patch of rocks.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.033
I'm just going to excavate.

35:39.533 --> 35:42.166
I might pick up and wait
for a little over the door.

35:42.166 --> 35:43.834
And I found this spot.

35:43.834 --> 35:45.300
It'll be easy to miss.

35:46.533 --> 35:47.800
Great. Okay.

35:49.900 --> 35:52.433
Oh, yeah.
There's a piece
of course gold.

35:52.433 --> 35:53.600
Awesome.

35:57.433 --> 36:00.467
Yeah, there's I think
there's nuggets under here.

36:00.467 --> 36:02.567
No way!

36:02.567 --> 36:04.800
The gold
is just unbelievably hot.

36:06.767 --> 36:08.100
It's just crazy.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.600
Thinking my eyes pop out.

36:11.266 --> 36:13.700
But they are really just
getting into it.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.700
There's a lot more gold here
for me to dredge.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.567
That's crazy.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.433
Crazy. Crazy rich.

36:21.567 --> 36:23.734
He's tried to do
this before with girlfriends,

36:23.734 --> 36:27.000
I think,
and it didn't work out.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.900
I'm not getting
a lot of gold out here
as it is.

36:30.900 --> 36:32.266
Like I can't [bleep].

36:38.367 --> 36:39.800
11 miles east.

36:52.634 --> 36:55.133
His operations
on the water may be down,

36:55.133 --> 36:58.166
but Mr. Gold is determined
not to skip a beat.

37:03.934 --> 37:05.734
As he tears
into the new cut

37:08.133 --> 37:09.467
at the inland mine.

37:20.767 --> 37:23.133
You got to be fast
on your toes in gold mining.

37:23.133 --> 37:25.567
You have to be able to focus
on all aspects

37:25.567 --> 37:26.767
of your business.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.400
Got some dirt moved.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.800
We're gonna name this
new cup, Cooper Gulch

37:37.800 --> 37:39.634
because it's right next
to Cooper Golf.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.333
Hopefully, this cut delivers
what we need

37:43.333 --> 37:45.367
because we have not
been on the water

37:45.367 --> 37:47.000
with the weather being so bad.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.100
Can't have any downtime.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.300
Not in any way.

37:52.300 --> 37:53.934
Not in operation this big.

37:55.734 --> 37:58.300
All right, now we're going
to run a haul truck...

37:59.333 --> 38:01.367
bring pay to the wash plant.

38:01.367 --> 38:03.867
First thing in the step
of gold mining,

38:03.867 --> 38:05.333
you need paydirt.

38:05.333 --> 38:07.400
Dirt with gold in it.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.300
That's the moneymaker
right there.

38:11.834 --> 38:13.233
This is a haul truck.

38:15.967 --> 38:18.100
Dump truck hauls ten yards.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.867
This holds 20.

38:19.867 --> 38:22.467
And it's made to be go
on the off-road.

38:24.133 --> 38:26.900
You know, my dad and I used
to run this mine together

38:26.900 --> 38:29.834
for many years,
but it wasn't pretty.

38:29.834 --> 38:32.467
You keep being a [bleep] ass.

38:32.467 --> 38:34.667
- You are [bleep].
- ...

38:34.667 --> 38:36.900
Clean up
your damn mess
when you get done.

38:36.900 --> 38:38.867
I'm gonna sell my half
of this [bleep] company,

38:38.867 --> 38:40.700
and you can do it by yourself.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.066
Thanks for the gold boys.

38:42.066 --> 38:43.667
We may have
to fight you for it.

38:44.700 --> 38:45.867
Now that's mine.

38:45.867 --> 38:47.266
I'm going to run it my way.

38:47.266 --> 38:49.934
Efficient, smart,
and a money-making machine.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.667
Here we go.

38:53.667 --> 38:56.800
Now he's going to put
a load of paydirt in here.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.266
That's a 992 loader.

39:01.266 --> 39:02.967
Every bucket is ten yards.

39:04.767 --> 39:06.400
Once we get it to load,

39:06.400 --> 39:07.934
give her a little shake,

39:07.934 --> 39:09.533
and now we're on our way.

39:11.133 --> 39:15.333
So we got 45,000 pounds worth
of dirt

39:15.333 --> 39:17.200
in the back of the truck.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.767
We're headed
to the wash plant.

39:20.266 --> 39:23.200
We're gonna dump
the paydirt in the pay pile.

39:30.433 --> 39:31.567
Wow.

39:31.567 --> 39:34.533
That is a pretty simple process.

39:34.533 --> 39:36.567
Load up the paydirt
from the cut.

39:36.567 --> 39:37.867
Bring it to the wash plant.

39:37.867 --> 39:39.867
Wash it.

39:39.867 --> 39:43.900
Now we just got to do it
about 10,000 more times.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.000
Hey, what's up, Rick?

40:14.867 --> 40:16.433
Time to score.

40:16.433 --> 40:18.333
After days
on the sidelines.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.300
Emily Riedel is looking
to make the most of a break

40:21.300 --> 40:23.900
in the weather
with a double dive day.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.934
He's working some really
challenging ground right now.

40:27.934 --> 40:29.634
It's just
a lot of overburden...

40:30.834 --> 40:34.867
a lot of really tightly packed
gravel, difficult to move.

40:37.133 --> 40:38.433
All right.
All right, Rick.

40:38.433 --> 40:40.166
That's good. I'll see you
when you get up.

40:40.166 --> 40:42.133
You don't have to hook up
the nozzle.

40:42.133 --> 40:44.066
We got another driver
coming right out.

40:44.066 --> 40:45.233
Okay.

40:50.066 --> 40:51.700
Rick's super
old-school diver.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.400
He's done an awesome job
at getting us

40:54.400 --> 40:55.967
on some unworked ground.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.700
He's worked through a lot
of the overburden and rocks.

40:58.700 --> 41:00.066
You're good.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.600
Bueno.

41:04.266 --> 41:05.834
It's snug enough.

41:05.834 --> 41:07.100
And now
we're going to get

41:07.100 --> 41:08.667
Grant down there
to suck up the gold.

41:10.300 --> 41:11.700
Go kick-ass.

41:43.934 --> 41:45.266
How's it looking
down there?

41:46.634 --> 41:48.900
The visibility
is terrible.

41:50.667 --> 41:52.166
The water is looking
pretty dark.

41:53.467 --> 41:54.667
Yeah, 10-4.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.033
Up. Coming up
on some cobble.

42:02.033 --> 42:03.367
Let me try this for a second.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.166
Yeah, roger that.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.567
I'm starting to see
a couple of specks

42:16.567 --> 42:17.767
of gold down here.

42:17.767 --> 42:19.300
That's exciting.

42:19.300 --> 42:22.533
Oh, yeah. Do you see
some gold down there?

42:31.934 --> 42:33.033
After that time,

42:33.033 --> 42:34.867
that's exactly
what we're looking for.

42:34.867 --> 42:36.667
Now, hopefully,
Grant can hit it big

42:36.667 --> 42:38.867
and pull in enough ounces
for two days.

42:38.867 --> 42:40.166
We need it.

42:40.166 --> 42:44.266
Definitely have high hopes,
but I'm aiming big
this summer.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.100
Rattle, rattle, rat.

42:51.834 --> 42:53.033
Ten miles west.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.934
Zeke, do you copy?

42:59.033 --> 43:00.533
How's it looking down there?

43:03.100 --> 43:06.266
I'm just bugging out
on all this gold here.

43:06.266 --> 43:07.800
It's just tripping me off.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.834
That's great.

43:09.834 --> 43:11.900
Finally back
on the sea floor.

43:11.900 --> 43:14.500
A fresh face topside.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.900
Maybe a good luck charm
for Zeke Tenhoff.

43:18.266 --> 43:20.433
I have only seen stuff
this good a couple of times.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.233
There haven't been that
many people that have searched

43:24.233 --> 43:25.967
around here a lot.

43:25.967 --> 43:27.100
And...

43:28.634 --> 43:30.367
it's just crazy.

43:30.367 --> 43:31.667
Wow.

43:33.166 --> 43:34.266
How are you doing?

43:34.266 --> 43:35.667
A little exhausted,
I guess.

43:35.667 --> 43:37.066
I mean.

43:37.066 --> 43:38.667
It's great on the ocean.

43:39.734 --> 43:41.233
It's great
to have a tender.

43:41.233 --> 43:42.467
Aw!

43:50.600 --> 43:53.467
It helps me know
that I don't have to make

43:53.467 --> 43:55.333
so many trips to the surface.

44:04.166 --> 44:06.200
I'm going to wrap it up
for today.

44:06.200 --> 44:07.800
Okay. Copy.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.400
Sounds good.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.433
Okay.

44:11.467 --> 44:14.300
Got to get it
when the going is good.

44:14.300 --> 44:16.233
Without a tender,
I probably wouldn't even

44:16.233 --> 44:17.567
been able to come out today.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.767
Thank God I had Lexi around
to help.

44:19.767 --> 44:21.467
I would have missed
this window,

44:21.467 --> 44:23.467
and a setback like that
would have really put me

44:23.467 --> 44:25.834
behind the curve for gold
production this summer.

44:27.266 --> 44:30.300
I think this is the best gig
that there is.

44:30.300 --> 44:32.734
Maybe the rule about
not bringing your girlfriend

44:32.734 --> 44:35.667
onto the boat
just depends a lot

44:35.667 --> 44:37.266
on who your girlfriend is.

44:42.200 --> 44:44.100
Because this has been working
out fine.

44:45.400 --> 44:47.100
I was on gold all day.

44:48.867 --> 44:50.000
Good day.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.233
That's awesome.

44:53.533 --> 44:55.400
Eighty miles
outside Nome.

44:58.967 --> 45:01.066
I think,
we're gonna need more gas.

45:06.467 --> 45:08.300
As Vernon Adkison
burns up

45:08.300 --> 45:09.767
the Kougarok coastline,

45:10.834 --> 45:13.600
Bryan Wilder braves
the frigid river water

45:13.600 --> 45:15.000
in search of gold.

45:22.533 --> 45:24.700
Damn wind
is blowing it out.

45:24.700 --> 45:26.800
Let's move that...

45:26.800 --> 45:29.066
Move that sled over here
to buck the wind.

45:30.333 --> 45:32.400
It's getting colder
than a winter...

45:32.400 --> 45:34.300
well, colder than
a witch out here.

45:41.700 --> 45:44.166
And just like
everything else out here,

45:44.166 --> 45:47.333
starting a fire is proving
to be a royal pain.

45:48.500 --> 45:50.367
Damn wind.

45:50.367 --> 45:52.300
You know, damn it.

45:54.100 --> 45:56.934
Bryan has been pretty good,
but off for a few hours now,

45:56.934 --> 45:59.000
dredging out
that river bottom.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.233
Hopefully, he's gotten
into something good

46:01.233 --> 46:04.133
and this hasn't been
a fool's errand from hell.

46:06.166 --> 46:07.800
Hey, Bryan.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.467
Let's go ahead
and shut it down.

46:10.467 --> 46:12.600
Get a shot.
We've got a good fire going.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.433
Come over here and get warm.

46:14.433 --> 46:16.834
He's freezing
his ass off out there.

46:16.834 --> 46:19.100
That water is ice cold.

46:23.367 --> 46:25.934
He's just praying
that I'd call him.

46:25.934 --> 46:27.300
He wouldn't call it.

46:27.300 --> 46:29.533
He would stay in
until he's blue all over.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.667
Just get the anchor up here
on the beach.

46:34.667 --> 46:36.467
You guys come on over
and get warm.

46:44.634 --> 46:46.533
Oh, I feel that, though.

46:46.533 --> 46:48.467
Oh, yeah.

46:48.467 --> 46:49.700
Yeah.

46:49.700 --> 46:51.867
I thought
you'd like that.

46:53.367 --> 46:55.066
Yeah.

46:55.066 --> 46:56.900
Your face
is a little bit blue.

46:56.900 --> 46:58.100
You know?

46:58.100 --> 46:59.967
I mean, you look good in blue.

47:08.433 --> 47:11.333
My goal is to become
the gold king of Nome.

47:11.333 --> 47:14.433
And if the weather is going
to kick us off the ocean

47:14.433 --> 47:16.133
from time to time,

47:16.133 --> 47:18.100
I need an inland
spot to keep me

47:18.100 --> 47:20.367
on top of the throne.

47:20.367 --> 47:22.867
So if this claim is as loaded
as the stories

47:22.867 --> 47:25.200
I'm hearing,
this could be the spot.

47:25.200 --> 47:28.700
So, let's see
if there's any gold
in the box.

47:28.700 --> 47:30.066
It's in here,

47:31.000 --> 47:32.200
kind of washed out.

47:33.700 --> 47:36.300
We're going to have to do
a cleanup in the carpet here
and see what we got.

47:43.567 --> 47:45.266
No. No gold.

47:45.266 --> 47:46.734
Well, no visible gold.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.700
If there's none showing,

47:53.700 --> 47:55.667
maybe we'll see something
later when we clean it.

48:01.133 --> 48:03.700
If we come up empty
after busting our balls

48:03.700 --> 48:06.533
to get out here,
I would not be a happy camper,

48:06.533 --> 48:07.634
to say the least.

48:07.634 --> 48:09.033
There have been times
when the box

48:09.033 --> 48:12.033
doesn't look great,
but we end up
with a strong cleanout.

48:12.033 --> 48:14.000
So here's to hoping
that happens.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.266
We'll give it about
one more beer,

48:16.266 --> 48:20.066
and then we'll put away
and get on out of here.

48:20.066 --> 48:22.066
- All right.
- Sounds good to me.

48:23.266 --> 48:24.834
When we're done,
we've got to take

48:24.834 --> 48:26.367
all these beer cans
out of here.

48:35.667 --> 48:37.867
Hey,
you got a copy.

48:40.266 --> 48:42.400
How's the pipe
down there? How's it going?

48:43.900 --> 48:45.166
Oh, pretty good.

48:47.834 --> 48:49.467
Weather
is a little edgy.

48:49.467 --> 48:51.000
Se we can wrap it up.

48:52.100 --> 48:53.333
All right.

48:55.700 --> 48:56.867
Well, I better...

48:59.600 --> 49:00.800
tag out.

49:02.700 --> 49:04.934
All right.
That's great. That's great.
Sounds good.

49:06.233 --> 49:07.967
All right, buddy.
I'll see you at the top.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.000
The Bering Sea kept us
off the water.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.367
But we cannot be stopped.

49:19.500 --> 49:21.567
We got two awesome
dives today

49:21.567 --> 49:23.033
and we came back
really strong.

49:23.033 --> 49:25.233
I think we just had
our biggest day of the season.

49:27.166 --> 49:28.500
We'll see how it goes.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.200
But if we keep up
at this rate,

49:30.200 --> 49:32.567
I can legit build a legacy
for my family.

49:36.500 --> 49:37.600
You kept me hanging.

49:39.200 --> 49:40.700
Back again are the waters.

49:45.100 --> 49:46.700
As the waves
pick up steam...

49:48.834 --> 49:51.567
one member of the fleet
is just getting started.

49:56.767 --> 49:58.667
We're off to do it again.

49:58.667 --> 50:01.834
The truth is, it is
South breeze.

50:01.834 --> 50:03.200
Ninety percent of the time,

50:03.200 --> 50:05.266
you do not go out
into these situations.

50:07.600 --> 50:12.033
Likely a day late
and $125,000 short,

50:12.033 --> 50:14.800
Kris Kelly looks to give
it a go just

50:14.800 --> 50:17.400
as Mother Nature's wrath returns.

50:25.533 --> 50:26.700
I got it.
I got it.

50:26.700 --> 50:27.867
Let's go for a boat ride.

50:27.867 --> 50:30.133
Come on, buddy.
Be in a better mood.

50:30.133 --> 50:31.567
Come on, let's go.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.634
Fire up the generator.

50:43.734 --> 50:45.834
So we tested out the Reaper,
and then we heard

50:45.834 --> 50:47.233
there was a break
in the weather.

50:47.233 --> 50:49.133
So we rushed out here
as fast as we can

50:49.133 --> 50:50.600
to get some mining in.

50:50.600 --> 50:53.000
Is it better today
than yesterday?

50:53.000 --> 50:54.800
At this point, not really.

50:54.800 --> 50:58.333
But we owe a boatload of money
at the end of the month.

50:58.333 --> 50:59.900
We're going. Simple as that.

51:02.367 --> 51:04.300
Security.
Security, security.

51:04.300 --> 51:06.367
This is Mistress leaving
the south wall, exiting

51:06.367 --> 51:09.667
the harbor, and in concerning
traffic on 16 and 72.

51:12.333 --> 51:14.667
From the point
where we're super desperate

51:14.667 --> 51:16.500
to get after it, we're going
to push.

51:16.500 --> 51:18.166
We're going to see
if we can get something

51:18.166 --> 51:20.000
a little something
better than nothing.

51:21.133 --> 51:22.333
What have we got to lose?

51:24.166 --> 51:25.467
Maybe a barge.

51:31.066 --> 51:33.367
This is exactly the way
it was yesterday.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.767
Except the winds coming
from the south slightly,

51:37.767 --> 51:39.333
yesterday it was coming
from the west.

51:40.700 --> 51:42.333
The south is always
the worst.

51:42.333 --> 51:44.867
The south-- Anything
south builds waves.

51:51.166 --> 51:53.166
This is what's known
as the Hail Mary.

51:53.166 --> 51:55.634
Either we get destroyed
or we get gold.

51:55.634 --> 51:58.500
I wish it was 50/50,
but that's optimistic.

52:05.400 --> 52:07.033
Get ready in position.

52:08.567 --> 52:09.767
Dropping.

52:12.333 --> 52:14.934
So we're going
on a different strategy.

52:14.934 --> 52:17.567
What we're going to do
is we're going to do
a giant U-turn...

52:19.133 --> 52:22.333
and then have our ass
in taking the power
of the wave.

52:25.467 --> 52:26.600
Here we go.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.834
Bull spuds down,
we're getting...
get the wash plant up

52:28.834 --> 52:30.600
and going and start running
some material.

52:35.567 --> 52:37.567
Everything
is running great.

52:37.567 --> 52:38.734
Very good.

52:39.934 --> 52:42.834
So we're about to turn
around prospecting.

52:42.834 --> 52:44.066
Let's see how it goes.

52:59.834 --> 53:01.333
That's what
we're looking for.

53:01.333 --> 53:03.033
This is the right ground.

53:03.033 --> 53:05.000
Ha-ha.
We're on cobble.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.266
Stand by for a test pass.

53:07.266 --> 53:08.600
Yeah, baby.

53:13.033 --> 53:15.333
What I want to hear
from them is I got like,

53:15.333 --> 53:18.367
you know, 5,000 colors
in that test count.

53:18.367 --> 53:20.166
I'm hoping they got some good.

53:31.300 --> 53:33.767
We lost our test pans somewhere.

53:40.367 --> 53:42.333
Hey, you're not going
to believe this.

53:42.333 --> 53:44.300
Our test pan is gone.

53:44.300 --> 53:46.800
The gold.
The gold pan is gone.

53:46.800 --> 53:50.066
I'm looking around for it,
but I have no idea

53:50.066 --> 53:51.700
where it went to.

53:51.700 --> 53:52.967
I don't know what to do.

53:54.367 --> 53:56.734
But I think
you're a good gold.

53:56.734 --> 53:59.166
There's some weird,
crusty layer on that.

53:59.166 --> 54:03.200
Okay. We'll just keep
processing the material.

54:05.367 --> 54:07.066
So this is a major
screw-up.

54:07.066 --> 54:09.000
We forgot the gold pan.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.567
That thing is like 20 bucks.

54:10.567 --> 54:13.300
But without it, we don't even
know if we're on gold or not.

54:13.300 --> 54:16.333
So we could be completely
wasting our time.

54:16.333 --> 54:17.433
I think.

54:17.433 --> 54:19.600
I think
the material looks good.

54:19.600 --> 54:21.000
We're just going to go
for it.

54:23.600 --> 54:27.400
Not ideal, but yeah,
it's not ideal.

54:27.400 --> 54:30.000
Basically, I have no idea
what I'm digging.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.166
If we're digging just
for funsies...

54:33.433 --> 54:35.834
we have no way to
even see our color.

54:35.834 --> 54:37.667
Once again, an amazing day.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.600
It's kind of hard
to prospect.

54:55.166 --> 54:56.667
I'm bouncing off spuds.

54:56.667 --> 54:58.300
We're twisting this spud.

55:00.567 --> 55:02.634
Swells coming in

55:02.634 --> 55:04.700
from all sorts of different directions.

55:08.967 --> 55:11.033
Getting pulled
all the way around.

55:11.033 --> 55:13.133
Oh,
we're spinning.

55:15.934 --> 55:17.266
Hey, we're spinning.

55:17.266 --> 55:18.400
I know.

55:21.233 --> 55:22.967
Turn on the Thrustmaster,

55:22.967 --> 55:24.433
get me north and south.

55:24.433 --> 55:27.133
Spin us against this wind
and current.

55:27.133 --> 55:28.867
Turn the Thrustmaster on.

55:33.166 --> 55:35.400
So with the spuds
being beaten up this bad,

55:35.400 --> 55:37.700
we really need to get
this barge under control.

55:39.200 --> 55:41.634
And the only way to do
that is with the Thrustmaster.

55:43.667 --> 55:47.000
Which is like a super-sized
outboard for this massive

55:47.000 --> 55:48.700
excavation barge.

55:48.700 --> 55:51.867
Otherwise, we could just smash
into shore and possibly lose

55:51.867 --> 55:53.266
everything we have.

56:02.133 --> 56:04.033
The batteries
are dead on the Thrustmaster.

56:04.033 --> 56:05.500
Oh, we're in trouble.

56:05.500 --> 56:07.266
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

56:10.834 --> 56:12.800
The batteries
on the Thrustmaster died

56:12.800 --> 56:14.166
for some weird reason.

56:14.166 --> 56:16.600
There's a power drain
somewhere going on.

56:18.533 --> 56:20.033
And the waves
are getting bigger.

56:21.834 --> 56:23.166
We might have to take off.

56:23.166 --> 56:24.567
This is all bad, dude.

56:27.667 --> 56:29.066
This is all bad.

56:49.533 --> 56:51.667
I hear nothing
but screeching metal.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.834
We're gonna end up snapping

56:54.834 --> 56:56.400
this spud cable eventually.

56:58.233 --> 56:59.867
This is [bleep] stupid.

57:05.467 --> 57:06.567
We got to get out of here.

57:06.567 --> 57:08.033
Calm down.
We'll be fine.

57:08.033 --> 57:10.567
My spuds are really getting
hammered right now.

57:13.867 --> 57:15.667
Like the metal is cracking.

57:15.667 --> 57:17.467
Well, pull them up.
We've to move...

57:17.467 --> 57:19.233
We can't do that
because the boat

57:19.233 --> 57:20.700
will drift into the shore.

57:22.634 --> 57:24.400
All right, let me get
the jumper cables ready.

57:26.100 --> 57:28.600
So the Mistress is getting
absolutely pounded.

57:30.166 --> 57:31.800
And the spuds are getting beat
to hell.

57:34.900 --> 57:37.367
Our only hope of not crashing
into shore is getting

57:37.367 --> 57:39.400
that engine going.

57:39.400 --> 57:41.533
If we can't jump-start
this Thrustmaster

57:41.533 --> 57:43.200
kiss the Mistress goodbye.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.567
Yeah, it's hooked up.

57:44.567 --> 57:47.467
I just got electrocuted.

57:53.567 --> 57:55.233
All right.
Let me check it.

58:10.200 --> 58:12.266
All right. We're on, baby,
we're on.

58:12.266 --> 58:14.600
Hey.
Crisis averted.

58:14.600 --> 58:15.967
Good job, team.

58:15.967 --> 58:17.333
Let's get fired back up.

58:17.333 --> 58:18.500
We're not quitting yet.

58:20.967 --> 58:22.166
Let's do it.

58:23.333 --> 58:24.433
Take that off.

58:32.567 --> 58:34.934
James, why don't we just stay
and work tonight?

58:37.367 --> 58:39.500
Okay. Well, let me...

58:40.867 --> 58:43.100
We just had
such an epic moment

58:43.100 --> 58:45.567
there pushing
through our problem.

58:45.567 --> 58:46.800
Problem averted guys.

58:46.800 --> 58:47.934
Well, let's get back
on the gold.

58:47.934 --> 58:50.000
James says
he's getting real tired.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.133
Huh?

58:52.133 --> 58:54.266
So I realized
we've been out a long time

58:54.266 --> 58:55.800
and it's getting late.

58:55.800 --> 58:57.266
Still, we have to keep pushing.

58:57.266 --> 58:58.367
We have no choice.

58:59.467 --> 59:01.533
But James is acting
like a little bitty baby,

59:01.533 --> 59:03.166
and he's too tired
to keep going.

59:04.533 --> 59:06.567
With that giant bill due
at the end of the month,

59:06.567 --> 59:08.233
it's time to bring
in the night crew.

59:17.367 --> 59:19.634
Go jump in, do it.

59:22.834 --> 59:25.000
James, Kevin
and all the other lightweights

59:25.000 --> 59:26.567
can go crawl in their beds,

59:26.567 --> 59:28.533
but me, I'm just getting started.

59:28.533 --> 59:30.667
We always can do this, baby.

59:31.767 --> 59:32.934
We got this!

59:34.767 --> 59:35.900
Yeah!

59:44.967 --> 59:48.233
So, it's all up to me now,
everybody took off.

59:48.233 --> 59:51.100
I'm left with a bunch of guys
that are...

59:51.100 --> 59:52.900
let's just say untrained.

59:52.900 --> 59:55.634
We're gonna make this work,
we have a game plan.

59:55.634 --> 59:57.967
Really, I'm just staying up
and making sure

59:57.967 --> 59:59.367
everything runs smooth.

59:59.367 --> 1:00:02.367
If I see a problem, I run
down there and hammer at it.

1:00:02.367 --> 1:00:04.700
Everything is going
to work out just fine.

1:00:07.033 --> 1:00:10.000
Man, 16 hours
straight up work today.

1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:13.934
Well, everyone's asleep anyway.

1:00:33.734 --> 1:00:35.934
We got Cooper gold
opened up,

1:00:35.934 --> 1:00:37.667
hopefully there's pay dirt.

1:00:37.667 --> 1:00:39.400
After two round
the clock days

1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:40.734
of inland mining...

1:00:40.734 --> 1:00:43.467
I'm gonna check the box here
and see how it's running.

1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:48.600
See if all this fuel and money

1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:50.500
that we're spending
is worth it.

1:00:51.634 --> 1:00:53.433
...Mr. Gold
is ready to see

1:00:53.433 --> 1:00:56.533
if the new cut makes the cut.

1:01:01.033 --> 1:01:03.266
Let's just keep our fingers crossed.

1:01:05.066 --> 1:01:07.266
With the weather kicking
the Myrtle off the ocean,

1:01:07.266 --> 1:01:09.033
me and the crew
have been working
day and night

1:01:09.033 --> 1:01:11.100
on this new cut
on the inland.

1:01:11.100 --> 1:01:13.433
I need this cut
to tap into the gold,

1:01:13.433 --> 1:01:15.834
and I need it
to be a killer streak.

1:01:15.834 --> 1:01:18.567
I'm gonna need it, considering
all the things on the water

1:01:18.567 --> 1:01:20.000
have been going thus far.

1:01:31.900 --> 1:01:34.333
♪ Do you see what I see? ♪

1:01:36.333 --> 1:01:37.967
We got gold in the box.

1:01:45.233 --> 1:01:47.567
We're on the right track.

1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:55.133
My back's been up against
the wall a thousand times

1:01:55.133 --> 1:01:56.400
in this business.

1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:58.967
Mother Nature is throwing
a few curveballs,

1:01:58.967 --> 1:02:02.667
pay streaks dry up, investments
don't come through.

1:02:02.667 --> 1:02:05.200
But every time you see
that pile of gold, you know

1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:06.767
you're coming back strong.

1:02:06.767 --> 1:02:09.166
It never fails to give you
that rush.

1:02:09.166 --> 1:02:11.800
It's almost like
the first time you saw gold
in the box.

1:02:13.433 --> 1:02:16.300
Big operation,
lots of money going out.

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:20.066
We need lots of gold
coming in to support it.

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.100
Get the box cleaned out,
get it in the Gold Room...

1:02:26.433 --> 1:02:28.200
weigh it out,
see what we have.

1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:35.166
And now it's time
to flex your BSG brain muscles

1:02:35.166 --> 1:02:38.300
with everyone's favorite
fake game show, Reveal It!

1:02:39.433 --> 1:02:40.900
Rough sea conditions
have always

1:02:40.900 --> 1:02:42.667
been a part of gold
mining in Nome.

1:02:42.667 --> 1:02:44.133
I'm sinking!

1:02:44.133 --> 1:02:46.767
Which member
of the fleet once bore

1:02:46.767 --> 1:02:49.333
the brunt of giant swells?

1:02:49.333 --> 1:02:50.734
Reveal it!

1:02:54.400 --> 1:02:55.600
Blargh!

1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:58.634
It was Steve Riedel
who was thrown up...

1:02:58.634 --> 1:02:59.734
Blarghh!

1:02:59.734 --> 1:03:02.066
...and down
by the rocky seas.

1:03:02.066 --> 1:03:03.600
Blarghh!

1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:05.000
I feel better now.

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.367
A little puking always does it
for a guy.

1:03:07.367 --> 1:03:11.200
Which team endured
an epic torrential downpour?

1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:12.800
Reveal it!

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:19.667
That would be the Kellys

1:03:19.667 --> 1:03:22.767
who got hosed while testing
out a brand-new bridge.

1:03:22.767 --> 1:03:24.200
Take the boat back
to the shore.

1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:26.333
We're done for today,
, [bleep].

1:03:26.333 --> 1:03:28.000
We gotta redo everything.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.634
And which captain
came face to face

1:03:30.634 --> 1:03:31.934
with a hurricane?

1:03:31.934 --> 1:03:33.367
Reveal it!

1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:40.100
They don't have a weight belt.

1:03:40.100 --> 1:03:41.367
Just chill out, okay?

1:03:41.367 --> 1:03:44.166
That was Vernon Adkison,
who brought aboard

1:03:44.166 --> 1:03:45.433
a real live hurricane...

1:03:45.433 --> 1:03:46.600
Bye, Dave.

1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:47.834
...Hurricane Dave.

1:03:47.834 --> 1:03:51.033
That was the last straw.

1:03:51.033 --> 1:03:52.166
Thanks for playing.

1:03:52.166 --> 1:03:54.634
We'll see you next time on...

1:03:54.634 --> 1:03:55.967
Reveal it!

1:04:06.367 --> 1:04:08.900
I wasn't planning
on being here 24 hours

1:04:08.900 --> 1:04:10.700
and I'm [bleep] hungry.

1:04:10.700 --> 1:04:13.033
Through the night
and well into the morning,

1:04:13.033 --> 1:04:18.066
Captain Kris is the last man
standing on the Bering Sea.

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:22.266
This is working 24 hours,
and it sucks.

1:04:22.266 --> 1:04:25.934
You know, just because
this is really heavy,
dangerous equipment

1:04:25.934 --> 1:04:31.033
and when you're up
over 24 hours straight,
in this [bleep] condition.

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:34.000
We're gonna push
through this, so.

1:04:41.867 --> 1:04:43.266
It's going in right now.

1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:48.166
We've been going so long,
I can't count
the hours anymore.

1:04:48.166 --> 1:04:50.100
Reaper Nation,
breaking records.

1:04:51.834 --> 1:04:53.800
But hey,
I really have no choice,

1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:55.900
desperate times call
for desperate measures,

1:04:55.900 --> 1:04:57.500
and we're gonna try
to keep going.

1:04:57.500 --> 1:04:59.600
I'm gonna pull this spud up.

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:02.600
They're going to push back
and make it go that way.

1:05:04.266 --> 1:05:06.233
We're gonna lift the spud
and push backwards

1:05:06.233 --> 1:05:07.667
to stay on this gold.

1:05:07.667 --> 1:05:08.867
Ready?

1:05:12.834 --> 1:05:14.133
I think we're good.

1:05:18.900 --> 1:05:20.000
Here we go.

1:05:29.867 --> 1:05:31.433
Whoa!

1:05:31.433 --> 1:05:34.467
, man, stop.

1:05:34.467 --> 1:05:36.967
Taylor! Taylor!

1:05:39.300 --> 1:05:41.667
Taylor.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:05:41.667 --> 1:05:43.200
Did you see, you lift it up,

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.500
the whole [bleep] thing
lifted up?

1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:48.433
I almost fell off the boat
right now, too.

1:05:48.433 --> 1:05:49.967
We're overtired right now.

1:05:49.967 --> 1:05:54.233
Everybody's making dumb
mistakes right now,
it's dangerous.

1:05:54.233 --> 1:05:57.333
Let's cut everything down.
I've had enough.

1:05:57.333 --> 1:05:59.634
Twenty-four hours
is all we can do.

1:05:59.634 --> 1:06:01.066
We're gonna hurt ourselves.

1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:04.066
So there's a point
you can keep pushing

1:06:04.066 --> 1:06:05.867
and there's a point
you gotta stop.

1:06:05.867 --> 1:06:07.233
Because you're so exhausted,

1:06:07.233 --> 1:06:08.900
you start making
stupid mistakes

1:06:08.900 --> 1:06:10.967
where someone's gonna
get hurt.

1:06:10.967 --> 1:06:12.233
I almost fell off the boat,

1:06:12.233 --> 1:06:14.233
and that excavator
could've tipped into water.

1:06:15.233 --> 1:06:16.967
We're calling it time
to head in.

1:06:20.300 --> 1:06:25.000
We're ready to be picked up
or shift change or something.

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:29.367
Everybody's real
tired here right now.

1:06:29.367 --> 1:06:31.066
Maybe you can bring James.

1:06:32.367 --> 1:06:34.300
I don't know what to say,
if we have nobody...

1:06:34.300 --> 1:06:36.734
I can't stay out here
ten more hours,

1:06:36.734 --> 1:06:39.600
I really can't,
I'm at the [bleep] limit.

1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:41.433
So, James, Kevin,
and all those [bleep],

1:06:41.433 --> 1:06:42.867
they're too tired
to relieve us.

1:06:42.867 --> 1:06:44.433
I'm the one out here
all night,

1:06:44.433 --> 1:06:47.266
and those guys are too tired, unbelievable.

1:06:47.266 --> 1:06:48.734
James is asleep,

1:06:48.734 --> 1:06:51.133
and he was supposed
to be here in 20 minutes.

1:06:51.133 --> 1:06:53.600
I'm not going to worry
about it, I killed it.

1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:56.734
Running the boat by myself
for the very first time,

1:06:56.734 --> 1:06:58.233
we got gold in the box.

1:06:58.233 --> 1:06:59.600
You want to know why that is,

1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:02.000
because we force-fed
that box today

1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:03.900
so everybody can go themselves.

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:07.634
You can take my boat
and go home.

1:07:07.634 --> 1:07:10.300
Turn that up to 1,200
and then help you
with the spuds.

1:07:14.900 --> 1:07:16.500
Almost there.

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:17.700
Whew!

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:18.867
I'm just tired.

1:07:18.867 --> 1:07:20.500
I'm gonna pilot
this thing back in,

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:21.734
I've never done it before,

1:07:21.734 --> 1:07:23.567
but that's never stopped me before.

1:07:23.567 --> 1:07:25.667
I've done everything else
in the last 24 hours,

1:07:25.667 --> 1:07:28.266
might as well add this
to the resume, too.

1:07:28.266 --> 1:07:29.900
Okay, let's get going.

1:07:32.900 --> 1:07:34.100
Let's go.

1:07:35.900 --> 1:07:37.200
We're on our way.

1:07:40.734 --> 1:07:42.033
Eleven miles east...

1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:44.834
on the outskirts of Nome...

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.400
I'm excited about doing
a cleanup today.

1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:52.467
I want to kill it,
I want to crush it.

1:07:52.467 --> 1:07:55.266
...it's time
for Zeke's first clean
out of the summer.

1:07:55.266 --> 1:07:57.634
But like, I would be happy
with an ounce gold.

1:07:57.634 --> 1:07:59.533
I'd like it to be more,

1:07:59.533 --> 1:08:01.433
but you always want it
to be more.

1:08:01.433 --> 1:08:04.567
I think this would be better
than my clean up last winter.

1:08:04.567 --> 1:08:06.900
I didn't get a lot of gold,
talking about last winter,

1:08:06.900 --> 1:08:09.200
but being here, a lot
of good gold to exploit.

1:08:10.533 --> 1:08:12.600
I'm not expecting
to break the bank today,

1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:15.266
but the goal is to do
better than I did last season

1:08:15.266 --> 1:08:16.467
and hopefully a lot better.

1:08:17.867 --> 1:08:20.700
All right, yeah,
I think the sluice box
is working good.

1:08:24.166 --> 1:08:25.734
This spot looks
super promising,

1:08:25.734 --> 1:08:27.200
so if the numbers
turn out good,

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:29.300
I think we could start
making some real money.

1:08:29.300 --> 1:08:30.767
That would be
a huge step forward.

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.200
All right, here we go.

1:08:38.767 --> 1:08:39.867
One ounce.

1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:43.066
Two ounces here.

1:08:46.300 --> 1:08:47.400
Three ounces.

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:50.767
All right,

1:08:50.767 --> 1:08:54.200
3.39, almost 3.5 ounces.

1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:58.233
3.39 ounces,
that's worth over $6,000,

1:08:58.233 --> 1:09:00.834
and after his first round
of prospecting,

1:09:00.834 --> 1:09:04.900
the prospects of a strong
summer season
are looking good.

1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:08.533
If I can keep the boat
in gold of this value,

1:09:08.533 --> 1:09:10.300
then I'll do really well.

1:09:10.300 --> 1:09:12.600
This is exactly
what I wanted to see,

1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:15.166
it's a better cleanout
than I had all of last season.

1:09:15.166 --> 1:09:17.567
Once we get to have
a little running
on this ground,

1:09:17.567 --> 1:09:19.934
we could be looking at killer
gold numbers this summer.

1:09:19.934 --> 1:09:23.367
I want my next cleanup
to be, like, five
or six spots like this,

1:09:23.367 --> 1:09:25.567
you know, and then, like,
have a 20-ounce cleanup.

1:09:27.700 --> 1:09:29.133
- Good start.
- Solid.

1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:34.600
On the other side
of town...

1:09:37.266 --> 1:09:39.200
La-la-la-la-la.

1:09:41.100 --> 1:09:44.266
This is why our cleanouts
take till
ten o'clock at night.

1:09:44.266 --> 1:09:48.433
Emily, can you not play
and just dump that stuff
so we can get going?

1:09:53.867 --> 1:09:54.967
It happens.

1:09:57.367 --> 1:09:58.834
I can make fun of her.

1:09:58.834 --> 1:10:00.867
We have a good relationship,
it worked out well.

1:10:01.934 --> 1:10:03.367
After a double dive day,

1:10:03.367 --> 1:10:06.000
Emily Riedel is hoping
for double gold

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.667
to keep her summer
going strong.

1:10:09.266 --> 1:10:11.100
We're hoping
that we're on
at least

1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:13.400
three-quarter ounce
an hour in this clean up.

1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:14.900
I think we did a lot better
than that.

1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:20.667
So, I'm gonna find gold.

1:10:20.667 --> 1:10:22.200
Hmm, so fine.

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:24.266
Even though Mother Nature
tried to stop us,

1:10:24.266 --> 1:10:26.500
she couldn't,
and we got two dives in

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:28.533
and there's really no setback
for us here.

1:10:30.233 --> 1:10:34.300
We had an amazing day,
and I'm expecting
a pretty healthy number.

1:10:36.634 --> 1:10:37.900
Sweet, guys, look at this.

1:10:39.967 --> 1:10:42.400
One, two.

1:10:44.266 --> 1:10:48.433
Three, four, five, six,

1:10:48.433 --> 1:10:52.867
seven, eight, nine, ten,

1:10:52.867 --> 1:10:56.233
eleven, 12, 13,

1:10:56.233 --> 1:11:02.133
fourteen, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20.

1:11:02.133 --> 1:11:03.567
There you go.

1:11:03.567 --> 1:11:06.900
Twenty-one, 22,

1:11:06.900 --> 1:11:11.500
twenty-three, 24, 25.

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:13.367
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!

1:11:13.367 --> 1:11:18.133
Twenty-five ounces
is worth a whopping 45 grand.

1:11:18.133 --> 1:11:20.967
All right, 25,
doing pretty good.

1:11:20.967 --> 1:11:23.200
It's awesome.
I'm so stoked.

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:26.834
I think that not only
I'll replenish the nest egg,

1:11:26.834 --> 1:11:28.667
but I'll go above
and beyond it.

1:11:28.667 --> 1:11:30.834
This year I'm aiming for 250,

1:11:30.834 --> 1:11:33.700
and at this point,
I'm starting to believe
it'll happen.

1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:35.300
Rocking it, man.

1:11:35.300 --> 1:11:36.734
Good.

1:11:38.767 --> 1:11:40.500
Good job.

1:11:44.734 --> 1:11:46.333
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey, Vernon.

1:11:46.333 --> 1:11:48.266
- How are you doing?
- Good, how are you doing?

1:11:48.266 --> 1:11:51.667
I'm doing all right,
but I could do
with a cocktail.

1:11:51.667 --> 1:11:53.133
Enjoy.

1:11:53.133 --> 1:11:56.066
Let's see what people
have to say today.

1:11:56.066 --> 1:12:00.867
And now,
another episode
of Social Hour with Vernon.

1:12:00.867 --> 1:12:02.634
Oh, let's see, all right.

1:12:06.667 --> 1:12:08.333
Yes, I've got a couple.

1:12:08.333 --> 1:12:13.467
I do the TV stuff,
and I am a professional
marine pilot.

1:12:13.467 --> 1:12:17.266
And I guarantee you
95% of you people out there

1:12:17.266 --> 1:12:18.934
don't even know
what the [bleep] that is.

1:12:18.934 --> 1:12:22.900
I've been piloting ships
for about 30 years.

1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:25.133
Started out
as an ordinary seaman,

1:12:25.133 --> 1:12:27.600
worked my way
up to Unlimited Master,

1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:31.133
became an Alaska State
Marine pilot,

1:12:31.133 --> 1:12:35.500
and I still do that work
when I'm not up here
gold mining.

1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:38.433
Being on a ship at sea
is like being in jail,

1:12:38.433 --> 1:12:42.400
except you get to work
12 hours a day, okay.

1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:46.867
I mean, you don't get
that kind of tonnage
for, like, serial murders.

1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:50.200
But after a while,
it came to the point

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.734
where I enjoyed being at sea.

1:12:52.734 --> 1:12:55.233
And then when I became
a master

1:12:55.233 --> 1:12:58.467
for you landlubbers out there,
that's captain.

1:12:58.467 --> 1:13:02.066
When I became master
of a 900-foot tanker,

1:13:02.066 --> 1:13:03.900
life became fairly sweet.

1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:05.967
I didn't have to do jack
diddly-squat.

1:13:05.967 --> 1:13:08.333
Fill up paperwork,
and look important.

1:13:10.133 --> 1:13:13.467
This has
been another episode
of Social Hour with Vernon.

1:13:15.967 --> 1:13:17.367
My phone just went dead.

1:13:20.333 --> 1:13:22.500
I guess this cocktail hour
is over.

1:13:28.066 --> 1:13:30.500
Boogie on down
the river, find a spot
to fish.

1:13:32.900 --> 1:13:34.600
The weather is finally
calming down,

1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:36.934
but it's too late to get
the Myrtle out right now.

1:13:36.934 --> 1:13:38.533
So with the inland killing it,

1:13:38.533 --> 1:13:42.300
I decided to take
a couple hours, take
my boys out fishing.

1:13:42.300 --> 1:13:43.433
Ready?

1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:56.433
Hang on.

1:14:00.767 --> 1:14:02.000
Yeah!

1:14:06.100 --> 1:14:08.367
We made it.

1:14:08.367 --> 1:14:11.066
Running a massive operation
like this,

1:14:11.066 --> 1:14:12.533
it's easy to get so busy,

1:14:12.533 --> 1:14:14.567
you don't spend enough time
with your kids.

1:14:14.567 --> 1:14:16.333
That's what happened
with my dad.

1:14:16.333 --> 1:14:17.767
Got one.

1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:22.734
Bring it over to me.

1:14:22.734 --> 1:14:25.667
Ooh, that's a keeper,
that's a keeper.

1:14:25.667 --> 1:14:28.333
I'm determined
to make sure it doesn't happen
with these guys.

1:14:28.333 --> 1:14:31.867
My relationship with my kids
is way more valuable
than gold.

1:14:31.867 --> 1:14:33.100
Nice job.

1:14:35.667 --> 1:14:38.300
We got fish in the cooler,

1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:39.800
life's good.

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:40.967
That's all that matters.

1:14:42.133 --> 1:14:43.567
Even if we didn't have fish,

1:14:43.567 --> 1:14:46.166
it... it'd still be just fun
being out here with the boys.

1:14:47.667 --> 1:14:49.166
We're gonna do this
a lot more.

1:14:52.033 --> 1:14:53.266
Oh, I got one.

1:15:04.033 --> 1:15:05.100
There you go, Vernie.

1:15:05.100 --> 1:15:07.533
These are mats
from the Kougarok first.

1:15:07.533 --> 1:15:10.333
So yeah, let's clean
those Kougarok mats

1:15:10.333 --> 1:15:12.700
and see what...
how well we did.

1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:14.634
After the journey
of a lifetime,

1:15:14.634 --> 1:15:16.934
Vernon Adkison
is about to find out

1:15:16.934 --> 1:15:20.467
if all the blood, sweat
and tears were worth it.

1:15:20.467 --> 1:15:22.967
It was a pain in the ass
getting set up out there.

1:15:22.967 --> 1:15:28.266
Just the road, I mean,
that was a justifying
transit, let me tell you.

1:15:28.266 --> 1:15:31.900
Getting to the Kougarok
is about as convenient
as getting to the moon.

1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:34.133
However, it's not
a deal-breaker for me

1:15:34.133 --> 1:15:35.667
if it's loaded with gold.

1:15:35.667 --> 1:15:38.634
But considering the hours
it takes to get
back and forth,

1:15:38.634 --> 1:15:41.934
it better be claimed
56 level of goodness,

1:15:41.934 --> 1:15:44.066
or it's time to say sayonara.

1:15:48.100 --> 1:15:49.700
- We got
a little chunky.

1:15:49.700 --> 1:15:51.033
- Yeah.
- Kougarok's paying out.

1:15:51.033 --> 1:15:52.533
Yeah. Hey, look,
we got riffles.

1:15:52.533 --> 1:15:54.266
We got riffles of gold here.

1:15:54.266 --> 1:15:55.834
Depending on what we get,

1:15:55.834 --> 1:15:57.834
I've got to call out
for a bottle of champagne.

1:16:00.900 --> 1:16:02.967
Oh, look
at that, nice.

1:16:06.433 --> 1:16:08.333
That sound never gets old.

1:16:08.333 --> 1:16:10.033
How's that coming along?

1:16:10.033 --> 1:16:11.400
I guess it's ready.

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:14.033
All right,
well, bring it on over here
and let's do it.

1:16:16.333 --> 1:16:17.600
All right.

1:16:19.467 --> 1:16:21.667
It's quarter ounce,

1:16:21.667 --> 1:16:27.400
half ounce.
1.2, 1.3, 1.6.

1:16:28.100 --> 1:16:31.166
She's still going, 1.78.

1:16:31.166 --> 1:16:32.934
Ugh!

1:16:32.934 --> 1:16:35.500
1.78 ounces,

1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:38.734
it's worth a little over
3,200 bucks.

1:16:38.734 --> 1:16:41.600
Ah, that to me
is not cutting it.

1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:44.166
Ah, you know,
considering all the trouble
of getting there

1:16:44.166 --> 1:16:46.667
and back and forth
and all that,

1:16:46.667 --> 1:16:49.900
using what we've got
right now, we can't play
for that.

1:16:49.900 --> 1:16:52.667
1.78 ounces is not horrible

1:16:52.667 --> 1:16:55.133
for an average day
of river dredging.

1:16:55.133 --> 1:16:58.934
But considering
the unholy pain it took
to get to the Kougarok,

1:16:58.934 --> 1:17:01.300
I'm not sure it even paid
for the gas.

1:17:01.300 --> 1:17:04.467
So thank you,
but no thank you, Kougarok.

1:17:04.467 --> 1:17:06.367
You can rot for all I care.

1:17:06.367 --> 1:17:07.467
So...

1:17:07.467 --> 1:17:08.734
Yeah, came in better.

1:17:08.734 --> 1:17:12.200
I mean, that's good beer
and pizza money right there,

1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:15.400
but it's not sticking
around forever money,
I'll tell you that.

1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.367
On the other side
of the harbor...

1:17:23.367 --> 1:17:25.834
Day.

1:17:25.834 --> 1:17:27.734
Every day is a [bleep] day.

1:17:29.700 --> 1:17:31.800
Kris Kelly
is hoping an all-nighter

1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:34.400
was enough to get
our Reaper Nation
back on track.

1:17:36.667 --> 1:17:38.233
Let's get this
and get going.

1:17:39.233 --> 1:17:41.533
The last run was really hard

1:17:41.533 --> 1:17:43.767
and we had a couple
of little problems,

1:17:43.767 --> 1:17:45.667
but we got gold
that nobody else got

1:17:45.667 --> 1:17:48.066
because we were out
when nobody else was out.

1:17:48.066 --> 1:17:49.834
So, overseeing
a giant operation

1:17:49.834 --> 1:17:52.467
has not been as lucrative
as I thought it would be,

1:17:52.467 --> 1:17:54.100
not by a long shot,

1:17:54.100 --> 1:17:57.100
and it's given me plenty
of sleepless nights.

1:17:57.100 --> 1:18:00.367
But I'm stubborn as hell,
and if I see any way
to get gold,

1:18:00.367 --> 1:18:03.300
I'm gonna keep pushing
until I make this work.

1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:05.500
See, like, all in here,
all in here,

1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:07.900
it's already starting
to stack up on the riffles.

1:18:07.900 --> 1:18:09.934
And I'm starting to see
gold in the box.

1:18:09.934 --> 1:18:13.533
Look at this piece, man,
this has some weight to it.

1:18:13.533 --> 1:18:16.600
Fingers crossed, this way out
is a good one, we need it.

1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:17.934
Okay, let's go.

1:18:17.934 --> 1:18:19.600
Yeah, baby.

1:18:24.133 --> 1:18:27.200
Yeah, lay every bucket,
this is, this is a good one.

1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:29.133
This is...
was a very good bucket.

1:18:29.133 --> 1:18:31.033
That's a lot of gold.

1:18:31.033 --> 1:18:33.400
We're seeing lots
of hard-earned gold,

1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:35.166
probably
the hardest-earned gold

1:18:35.166 --> 1:18:37.233
you're supposed to make
on an excavator.

1:18:37.233 --> 1:18:40.066
There you go, I like that.
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

1:18:40.066 --> 1:18:41.900
Last cleanout
was an embarrassment,

1:18:41.900 --> 1:18:44.667
I get more gold off
a suction operation,

1:18:44.667 --> 1:18:46.467
not a giant excavator barge.

1:18:46.467 --> 1:18:48.934
We have to start doing
way better or this summer

1:18:48.934 --> 1:18:50.634
is gonna be
a financial bloodbath.

1:18:51.767 --> 1:18:53.533
Oh, this is going
to tell the tale.

1:18:55.233 --> 1:18:56.533
Okay, here we go.

1:18:56.533 --> 1:18:58.033
We're at zero.

1:19:01.900 --> 1:19:04.467
Two and... Oh, my God,
it's like two or three ounces.

1:19:04.467 --> 1:19:06.033
Keep going,
keep going, keep going.

1:19:06.033 --> 1:19:07.967
- Come on, come
on, come on.
- ...

1:19:07.967 --> 1:19:09.533
3.34.

1:19:11.967 --> 1:19:13.300
3.34.

1:19:13.300 --> 1:19:16.000
Which is
pretty bad.

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:19.500
3.34 ounces
is worth about $6,000

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:25.367
and Reaper Nation is still far
from the behemoth
their captain envisioned.

1:19:25.367 --> 1:19:27.767
There's a lot of variables
that come in mining.

1:19:27.767 --> 1:19:29.300
We didn't have a test pan.

1:19:29.300 --> 1:19:30.533
The weather was really bad,

1:19:30.533 --> 1:19:32.533
so we had to fight
against all everything,

1:19:32.533 --> 1:19:34.600
but we need those numbers
to go up.

1:19:37.300 --> 1:19:38.567
Self-reflection time.

1:19:38.567 --> 1:19:40.934
This has been a disaster
so far.

1:19:40.934 --> 1:19:43.233
I realized we had everything
going against us

1:19:43.233 --> 1:19:46.166
the last couple of days
and we still managed
to get gold.

1:19:46.166 --> 1:19:48.867
But let's be real,
these numbers are terrible.

1:19:48.867 --> 1:19:51.266
All I can do is hope
once the weather clears,

1:19:51.266 --> 1:19:52.900
we get the Reaper
in the water

1:19:52.900 --> 1:19:55.634
and Reaper Nation rises
to the top.

1:19:55.634 --> 1:19:57.567
Okay, let's go, we're done.

1:19:57.567 --> 1:20:00.834
And that concludes
another episode
of What the [bleep]!

1:20:03.734 --> 1:20:05.033
Across town...

1:20:08.400 --> 1:20:11.333
Time to do a cleanup,
the funnest part of the job.

1:20:14.300 --> 1:20:15.734
Buckets look good.

1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:27.500
I want to get gold out, scale
will know how good it is.

1:20:27.500 --> 1:20:30.367
The first cleanout
from the inland mine's new cut

1:20:30.367 --> 1:20:33.266
will determine if it's a cut
above the rest.

1:20:34.634 --> 1:20:36.133
Things
are looking good.

1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:40.400
I have a goal for 3,000 ounces
this summer,

1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:43.533
and with the crap
that's been going on
in the water,

1:20:43.533 --> 1:20:46.667
I need the inland to be firing
on all cylinders.

1:20:46.667 --> 1:20:49.867
So, I need this new cut
to be ringing the bell,
big time.

1:20:51.634 --> 1:20:54.000
That's a pile
of gold right there,

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.133
hopefully the deeper
we get in the Cooper Gulch,
the better the gold gets.

1:20:58.133 --> 1:20:59.967
Let's bring it in,
weigh it up.

1:21:03.934 --> 1:21:10.400
20, 30, 40, 60, 80.

1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:15.433
120, 130, 140,

1:21:15.433 --> 1:21:18.433
150,

1:21:18.433 --> 1:21:19.667
160.

1:21:20.867 --> 1:21:24.600
190, 206, 212...

1:21:29.266 --> 1:21:30.300
219.

1:21:30.300 --> 1:21:31.800
Cooper Gulch is paying.

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:39.367
219 ounces,
it's worth over $395,000.

1:21:39.367 --> 1:21:41.734
And Cooper Gulch
has made the cut.

1:21:42.767 --> 1:21:45.166
Two-nineteen,
that's a good cleanup.

1:21:46.266 --> 1:21:48.600
And just like that,
we're back on track.

1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:52.734
Feels good taking this
over from my dad,
not missing a beat.

1:21:52.734 --> 1:21:54.600
It feels damn good.

1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:56.333
Hopefully when the weather clears,

1:21:56.333 --> 1:21:58.266
we can get back out
on the water

1:21:58.266 --> 1:22:00.934
and gonna be kicking ass
on all fronts.

1:22:04.734 --> 1:22:07.166
Keep drawing dirt,
keep putting dirt
through the box,

1:22:07.166 --> 1:22:09.734
keep sluicing,
keep making gold.

1:22:11.166 --> 1:22:12.500
So far so good.

1:22:13.734 --> 1:22:15.200
It'll get better and better.

1:22:18.367 --> 1:22:20.734
Mr. Gold starts
living up to his name...

1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:25.200
while Kris and Vernon
continue to sputter.

1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.834
Next time
on Bering Sea Gold...

1:22:30.834 --> 1:22:33.333
We're getting out.
We're going digging.

1:22:33.333 --> 1:22:35.000
What do you say, Vernon?

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:36.233
damn it, brother.

1:22:36.233 --> 1:22:37.934
I've been waiting nine years
to do this.

1:22:37.934 --> 1:22:40.367
I came back to get the gold.

1:22:40.367 --> 1:22:41.467
That's it.

1:22:41.467 --> 1:22:42.867
We're ready to turn
everything on

1:22:42.867 --> 1:22:44.800
and finally start making
some money.

1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:47.033
Good.

1:22:47.033 --> 1:22:48.333
Hey!

1:22:48.333 --> 1:22:49.634
We're almost there.

1:22:49.634 --> 1:22:51.467
Nothing has changed
in 100 years,

1:22:51.467 --> 1:22:54.333
and everybody that's out here
mining is crazy.

1:22:54.333 --> 1:22:57.233
Oh, man, you need to be able
to do this yourself.

1:22:57.233 --> 1:22:58.800
Not me.

1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:00.667
Well, what are you doing
on the boat, man?

1:23:00.667 --> 1:23:02.433
Everything's all [bleep] up.

1:23:02.433 --> 1:23:05.100
There's only one thing
that puts a smile on my face,

1:23:05.100 --> 1:23:06.800
make some gold.

1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:08.533
Whoo!

1:23:08.533 --> 1:23:11.634
Somebody on this [bleep] boat
is going to die.

1:23:11.634 --> 1:23:13.400
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:15.634
I got a fever.

1:23:15.634 --> 1:23:16.834
Gold fever.

1:23:16.834 --> 1:23:19.000
That somebody hasn't already.

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.567
Hell yeah.

1:23:21.567 --> 1:23:24.400
It's only by the grace
of whatever God exists.

1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:26.066
Pow!
