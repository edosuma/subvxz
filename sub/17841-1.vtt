02:07.493 --> 02:13.682
Oh, yeah! That was for all you pinheads
too hip to take off yourjackets in the 95ยบ heat.

02:13.773 --> 02:17.209
When the weather gets like this
it brings all you nutbags out,

02:17.293 --> 02:22.925
and since l am a trouble magnet, l have
one thing to say to you bozos: back off.

02:23.013 --> 02:26.801
Here's the Sons of Thunder from their album
<i>Scrambled Eggs and Wobbly Legs.</i>

02:26.893 --> 02:32.684
This is lan the Shark on the station with
more hair, more flair, yet so debonair: KPPX.

02:32.853 --> 02:37.051
Rebel Radio!

03:07.493 --> 03:10.291
Hey! Hey! You've gotta check in here!

03:13.093 --> 03:16.642
Get Security on the second floor.
We've got a bogey in elevator one.

03:16.733 --> 03:18.883
lt's that guy in the delivery uniform again.

03:18.973 --> 03:21.168
OK, be wild. Be as wild as you wanna.

03:21.253 --> 03:26.452
lf you feel like wetting yourself, go with it,
OK? Anarchy's good. They like anarchy, OK?

03:26.533 --> 03:29.923
- But what are we supposed to say?
- What? Don't say anything.

03:30.013 --> 03:34.006
Jeez, do you wanna blow this? You know
how much these stupid hats set me back?

03:34.093 --> 03:37.290
- Hi.
- Oh, no. Hey, excuse me?

03:37.373 --> 03:39.762
Mike, it's him. The wacko's back.

03:43.653 --> 03:46.042
Yeah, l'm up here in A&R right now.

03:50.733 --> 03:53.042
l'm not goin' anywhere.

03:56.973 --> 03:58.611
Oh, hey, dude.

03:58.693 --> 04:01.002
- Hey, hi. Are you an executive here?
- Yeah.

04:01.093 --> 04:03.448
How you doin'?
My name's Chazz. Chazz Darby.

04:03.533 --> 04:08.653
l'm in this band and we've got this incredibly
sweet demo. l think you should hear it.

04:08.733 --> 04:12.521
l can't take that tape from you.
lt's called unsolicited material.

04:12.613 --> 04:17.164
Hey, but this is the real thing, man. This is
rock'n'roll. None of that gimmicky stuff.

04:17.253 --> 04:21.007
l would love to hear it,
but if it's unsolicited, l can't touch it.

04:21.093 --> 04:23.129
We've been trying to get solicited...

04:23.213 --> 04:26.762
Well, then maybe a gimmick would help.
The cream always rises, OK?

04:26.853 --> 04:29.083
Super-duper. Thanks.

04:29.173 --> 04:31.004
All right, dude. Thanks a lot. Whoa!

04:31.093 --> 04:34.927
You again!
You just can't learn, can you, scumbag?

04:35.373 --> 04:37.364
Take care now.

04:38.013 --> 04:39.332
Here's your tape.

04:48.693 --> 04:50.684
Hey. How was your day?

04:51.373 --> 04:53.933
Oh, Gary is a tremendous asshole.

04:54.013 --> 04:57.608
He had this whole stack of invoices
and he made me arrange them by date.

04:57.693 --> 04:59.888
- He's such a tweaker.
- lt sucks.

05:00.493 --> 05:04.611
- Did you mail the rent?
- You, uh... you didn't leave me a stamp.

05:05.453 --> 05:07.887
Well, maybe you could have
gone and bought one.

05:12.333 --> 05:16.121
Chazz! What the hell
happened to my make-up?

05:16.453 --> 05:18.364
lt fell in the toilet.

05:19.373 --> 05:21.648
Shit! Babe, come on.

05:21.733 --> 05:25.123
- l told you not to leave it on the tank.
- You ruined my make-up, butt!

05:25.213 --> 05:28.330
What's this attitude, Kayla?
Know what l've been through today?

05:28.413 --> 05:30.529
l guess you woke up
when the sun was warm

05:30.613 --> 05:34.891
and rode your Harley up and down Melrose
impressing all the 15-year-old girls, right?

05:34.973 --> 05:38.283
l was down at Palatine Records.
That's where l was.

05:39.493 --> 05:42.212
Really? What happened?

05:42.293 --> 05:46.002
l had a meeting with
a big record executive and, uh...

05:46.093 --> 05:48.084
What did he say? Why didn't you tell me?

05:48.173 --> 05:50.482
Well, we talked about solicitation

05:50.573 --> 05:55.283
and the guy said he'd snap us up
in a second if it weren't for the lawyers.

05:55.373 --> 05:57.967
- Did he like the tape?
- l was about to give it to him,

05:58.053 --> 06:01.523
then a security guard showed up
and ruined everything.

06:03.933 --> 06:05.810
- Come on.
- Please.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.925
Hey, it's true. l'm making
really good contacts. l am.

06:09.013 --> 06:13.564
When they hear this song they'll go apeshit.
lt's just gonna take time. What's the big deal?

06:13.733 --> 06:18.853
The ''big deal'' is that <i>l'm</i> doing the bullshit
work and you're living the rock'n'roll life.

06:18.933 --> 06:22.846
- l wanna live the life, too.
- l'm doing this for us.

06:23.813 --> 06:27.442
Come on, babe. You know that
once l make it you got a free ride.

06:27.533 --> 06:29.330
l'm gonna treat you like gold.

06:30.253 --> 06:32.244
Chazz, it's been months.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.528
Maybe <i>you</i> should get ajob.

06:35.173 --> 06:42.011
This is my job. l am trying managers, record
executives, club owners. That's hard work.

06:42.093 --> 06:45.403
You get to sit in a nice office all day
smoking and drinking coffee.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.928
- Oh!
- This is bullshit!

06:48.013 --> 06:50.766
- Oh, my snout.
- You bastard!

06:50.853 --> 06:54.289
l hate you. You are nobody
and you are never gonna be anybody.

06:54.373 --> 06:57.968
You're treating me like l'm a goober
after l wrote this song for you?

06:58.373 --> 07:00.887
You wrote that song before you even met me.

07:01.773 --> 07:04.924
- So?
- So you get out!

07:05.013 --> 07:08.164
Get out now! Get lost!

07:08.253 --> 07:09.845
- OK, OK, OK, OK. Kayla!
- Go!

07:09.933 --> 07:11.764
- Keep going!
- Kayla!

07:11.853 --> 07:13.969
You poser!

07:14.053 --> 07:16.806
l always knew you were a loser!

07:17.533 --> 07:19.922
Everyone warned me!

07:20.573 --> 07:22.962
l hate your music! l always have!

07:25.653 --> 07:27.644
She booted you out again, huh?

07:28.373 --> 07:30.204
What a bitch.

07:30.293 --> 07:32.284
l mean, that that happened.

07:32.373 --> 07:35.046
Hey, she's gonna be jealous
in six months from now

07:35.133 --> 07:38.011
when we're on the cover
of <i>Rip</i> magazine lookin' cool.

07:38.093 --> 07:40.288
- Shut up.
- l'm just sayin'.

07:41.213 --> 07:42.885
- Rex.
- What?

07:42.973 --> 07:46.124
l told you to stock the end caps
and mop the employee lounge.

07:46.613 --> 07:49.332
- Too late. l'm outta here.
- l'll tell Covington.

07:49.413 --> 07:51.404
Oh, be quiet.

07:58.253 --> 08:00.244
Hey, Chazz, what's up?

08:00.973 --> 08:05.205
- He's movin' in with us for a while.
- Great! We can rock out after breakfast.

08:05.293 --> 08:09.605
Things are gonna happen to us no matter
what that chimp from Palatine Records says.

08:09.693 --> 08:13.811
You see, that's just it. You think
everything's gonna happen <i>to</i> you.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.849
You gotta make it happen.

08:15.933 --> 08:20.802
How many practices have you missed
cos you're cleaning up some stiff's pool?

08:22.773 --> 08:25.241
Get in the truck, dingus.

08:34.453 --> 08:36.443
l'll be right there.

08:41.693 --> 08:45.811
Man, Chazz is right. All we gotta do
is make our own action, you know?

08:45.893 --> 08:49.602
That's the way it is, little bro.
D'you think Tommy Lee waited for the bus?

08:49.693 --> 08:53.322
Man, he hustled. That's how come
he gets to pork Heather Locklear.

08:53.413 --> 08:56.086
Yeah, well, we got the look, man.
We're gonna be huge.

08:56.173 --> 08:57.970
Yeah, we're almost there.

08:58.053 --> 09:03.491
Chazz says once we get a contract, chicks
with breast implants pick out your clothes.

09:03.573 --> 09:06.485
Cover your mouth.
You're shooting phlegm all over my ass.

09:06.573 --> 09:09.371
Say ''gesundheit''. l say it for you, man.

09:11.373 --> 09:13.364
Honey, l'm home.

09:16.933 --> 09:19.208
- Hey, Pip, check this out.
- Oh! Oh!

09:19.293 --> 09:22.251
The lncredible Crash Dummies. Whoo!

09:22.373 --> 09:25.171
You must have five-fingered
most of the store by now.

09:25.253 --> 09:28.529
Oh, man. Most of these guns
are discontinued anyway.

09:29.573 --> 09:33.885
Like this Uzi water pistol.
They got rid of it cos it looked too real.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.964
- Yo!
- Mama.

09:38.773 --> 09:42.049
Wow. Now you got yourself
a whole arsenal here.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.130
What are you doing?

09:50.213 --> 09:53.250
Pepper sauce. Active ingredient: capsicum.

09:53.333 --> 09:56.609
You blast this in somebody's face
and they're all like ''Oh! Oh!''

09:57.973 --> 10:01.409
Some Hollywood Boulevard trash
comes shimmying up the rain pipe...

10:01.653 --> 10:03.644
- Hey!
- Whoa!

10:08.253 --> 10:12.849
Listen up, you lowlifes, what the hell
are we doin' here on a Thursday night?

10:12.933 --> 10:14.332
That's right.

10:14.413 --> 10:17.405
Rock'n'roll!

10:17.813 --> 10:21.203
OK, we're here to party tonight

10:21.293 --> 10:23.761
with our little buddies,

10:23.853 --> 10:26.845
the Sons of Thunder.

10:27.973 --> 10:32.046
Sons of Thunder? Didn't we blow them off
the stage at Chez Bang six months ago?

10:32.133 --> 10:38.242
So why don't all you little idiots
press your faces up against the speakers

10:38.333 --> 10:41.405
and blow your brains out!

10:44.453 --> 10:48.002
Look at this crap. What do we
give away first, hats or hair-care products?

10:48.093 --> 10:51.210
Girls, you wanna get us
a couple of drinks, please?

10:54.173 --> 10:56.050
Ooh, serious bumper.

10:56.133 --> 10:59.045
You wanna punch it up, lan?
You're as spunky as a corpse.

10:59.133 --> 11:02.125
The Sons of Thunder,
for Christ's sake? Pablum.

11:02.213 --> 11:05.888
- How can you even tell these bands apart?
- l read the trades.

11:05.973 --> 11:10.125
First of all l'd like to say thanks to lan
and Rebel Radio for playing our single

11:10.213 --> 11:12.408
and basically getting us signed.

11:12.893 --> 11:14.292
ls this on?

11:16.533 --> 11:20.128
? Don't hate me

11:20.213 --> 11:22.283
Look at them stupid pantaloons.

11:22.373 --> 11:25.888
- That's what we gotta do.
- Looks like they got a load in them pants.

11:26.253 --> 11:30.565
No, they played this song on the radio, and
they got an album. That's what we gotta do.

11:30.653 --> 11:34.248
? Your lips are full, your head is empty

11:34.493 --> 11:37.929
? This faded Valentine is what you sent me

11:40.053 --> 11:43.204
All we've got to do is get 'em
to play the tape and we're golden.

11:43.293 --> 11:46.012
- This is never gonna work.
- Pip, what is your problem?

11:46.173 --> 11:49.449
Remember that guy Doper Greg?
Remember that guy, man?

11:49.533 --> 11:54.288
He used to blow bong hits in his iguana's
face and make the thing watch cartoons.

11:54.413 --> 11:57.246
- So what? Will you shut up?
- Just get to the point. What?

11:57.333 --> 12:01.121
He won a radio giveaway and when he
went to the station they wouldn't let him in.

12:01.213 --> 12:06.571
lt was like this total security building. They
slid his ticket through a slot with salad tongs.

12:06.653 --> 12:09.963
So just because that anus couldn't get in
means that we can't?

12:10.133 --> 12:13.170
lf anybody gives us any static,
l shove this in their face.

12:13.253 --> 12:15.050
Agh!

12:15.133 --> 12:17.772
But remember that fat kid
on <i>Hard Copy</i> with a toy gun?

12:17.853 --> 12:20.242
The cop zapped him with a Taser
till he went bald.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.405
Then he sued for a million bucks
when his pubes didn't grow.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.802
He's still got no hair on his balls, man.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.924
Go to the back.

13:00.293 --> 13:03.091
- lt's locked.
- Pip, give me your bank card.

13:05.093 --> 13:09.371
- Come on, let's go. l'll get this door open.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.724
Piece of cake. Watch this.

13:13.933 --> 13:16.128
- What's your secret code?
- Huh? What for?

13:16.373 --> 13:18.682
That's how these things work.

13:18.773 --> 13:22.322
- l can't tell you my code.
- Will you tell him the code? And hurry up.

13:22.413 --> 13:24.210
<i>You</i> punch it in, OK?

13:29.093 --> 13:31.084
Please don't look.

13:37.253 --> 13:40.290
- Hey! The thing took my card!
- Oh, shit.

13:40.373 --> 13:42.284
All right. Stand back.

13:42.373 --> 13:44.364
What are you doing, MacGyver?

13:46.613 --> 13:48.922
Open it up. l'm gonna short-circuit it.

13:49.013 --> 13:52.722
- Nah.
- We almost got in. That's too bad. Let's go.

13:52.813 --> 13:55.805
- Hey, Pip, you quitting on us?
- The door's locked.

13:55.893 --> 14:00.171
You flake! You don't care about this band.
You run around all day in your fudgies.

14:00.253 --> 14:01.447
- Not true.
- lt is too!

14:01.533 --> 14:04.605
- l always gotta tell you to put pants on.
- He's making this up!

14:04.693 --> 14:09.005
Will you both shut up, please?!
OK. You're brothers, all right?

14:09.093 --> 14:11.323
We haven't lucked out yet. Stay here, Pip.

14:11.413 --> 14:13.369
Agh! You got a big mouth, man!

14:17.853 --> 14:19.252
Hey, Pip.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.725
Oh, my God.

14:36.013 --> 14:38.004
Pip. Pip.

14:38.813 --> 14:40.565
Oh, my... Here.

14:40.653 --> 14:44.851
Are you all right? Cos l'm really sorry.
l just came out for a cigarette.

14:45.173 --> 14:49.928
- lt's all right. Don't worry about it.
- l'm really sorry. l just came out and bonk!

14:53.053 --> 14:55.248
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.449
<i>Suzzi</i>, <i>caller 50 needs some tickets.</i>

14:57.533 --> 15:01.208
Shit. l gotta go. Bye.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.725
Yeah! Sweetness.

15:06.933 --> 15:08.924
Come on.

15:15.013 --> 15:17.004
There we go.

15:26.453 --> 15:31.652
<i>You wanna make a change</i>, <i>right? Get serious</i>
<i>about your look at Hair Bomb on Melrose.</i>

15:31.733 --> 15:35.851
- What, Doug?
- Um, here, see. lt's all there.

15:35.933 --> 15:40.370
<i>Colouring</i>, <i>razor cuts</i>, <i>popcorn</i>, <i>perms and</i>
<i>weaves. lt brings out the rock star in you.</i>

15:41.573 --> 15:44.963
- Well, this is beautiful.
- Well, l try to be a team player.

15:45.773 --> 15:47.764
l may need you to come in tomorrow.

15:47.853 --> 15:50.925
l'm cutting loose some dead weight.
There'll be a lot going on.

15:51.013 --> 15:53.208
Oh, boy.

15:53.293 --> 15:58.003
- What's the problem?
- Well, l've been having a little bit of, uh,

15:58.093 --> 16:03.451
- itching on my... lt could be haemorrhoids.
- l don't wanna hear that.

16:03.533 --> 16:07.048
l know. lt's just that l made
an appointment with my proctologist

16:07.133 --> 16:10.011
to get some type of cream or something.

16:10.693 --> 16:14.686
So you're gonna leave me high and dry?
That's a nice team attitude.

16:15.373 --> 16:18.968
Well, l suppose l could
come in for most of Saturday.

16:19.053 --> 16:21.362
- And Sunday.
- Well, yeah, yeah.

16:21.453 --> 16:24.809
Now, when are you planning
on breaking this to everyone?

16:25.933 --> 16:28.731
l thought l'd wait for
exactly the right moment.

16:28.813 --> 16:32.647
l mean, these things require
a certain measure of delicacy.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.530
? <i>Are you ready</i>

16:37.613 --> 16:39.729
? <i>To rumble?</i>

16:39.813 --> 16:42.646
<i>Sunday! Swamp motorcycle racing at its best.</i>

16:42.733 --> 16:46.408
<i>The USSCA brings you the ultimate</i>
<i>in swamp-race action.</i>

16:46.493 --> 16:49.246
<i>60</i>,<i>000 cubic feet of</i>
<i>muddy slop poured into...</i>

16:49.333 --> 16:51.130
Hey.

16:53.893 --> 16:55.531
We're a band.

16:55.773 --> 16:58.810
Of course. <i>The Partridge Family.</i>
Which one of you is Laurie?

17:01.413 --> 17:04.609
- Get out.
- We came to talk to you about a demo tape.

17:04.693 --> 17:08.446
We were wondering if you could set us up
like you did with the Sons of Thunder.

17:08.613 --> 17:12.208
How did you morons get in?
They've got electronic locks on the doors.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.885
We had to break in.

17:13.973 --> 17:17.761
- This place is sealed up like a dolphin's butt.
- Watertight!

17:20.333 --> 17:22.243
Let me get this straight.

17:24.093 --> 17:26.163
You guys are an unsigned band,

17:26.252 --> 17:30.565
and you broke into the radio station
to get your demo played on the air?

17:31.293 --> 17:34.410
- That's about the skinny of it.
- And what sound

17:34.493 --> 17:38.008
are you megastars of the future hip to?

17:38.093 --> 17:40.243
What is your musical vibe?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.164
- Well...
- That's a good question.

17:42.253 --> 17:45.609
- We could play anything.
- Not that slap-bass noise. l hate that.

17:45.693 --> 17:49.163
- lt's more like a power slop.
- But we don't limit ourselves to labels.

17:49.253 --> 17:54.885
<i>There's always someone who wants to lump</i>
<i>you together with the other buttholes.</i>

17:54.973 --> 17:57.612
<i>This is one of the things</i>
<i>we're struggling against.</i>

17:57.693 --> 18:00.685
- l'm telling you, it is tough.
- This guy knows.

18:01.093 --> 18:05.689
l got booted out of Palatine Records,
my girlfriend kicks me out of the apartment...

18:05.773 --> 18:08.731
Well, l'm sorry.
l'm just trying to conjure up

18:08.813 --> 18:11.247
<i>the kind of woman</i>
<i>who would go out with you.</i>

18:11.333 --> 18:14.564
<i>She's not like what you'd think.</i>
<i>She's actually really cool</i>

18:14.653 --> 18:20.205
<i>and</i>, <i>well</i>, <i>l guess what it all comes down to</i>
<i>is that we really care about each other and</i>

18:20.293 --> 18:23.524
l screwed up. She's been
there for me from the beginning.

18:23.613 --> 18:26.446
l think l let her down,
but l still want us to be tight.

18:26.533 --> 18:28.524
Uh-oh, l think we're busted.

18:29.533 --> 18:33.003
- What did l do now?
- Get these guys out. Are we still on air?

18:33.093 --> 18:36.608
Milo, l get six minutes of talk an hour.
What do you care how l spend them?

18:36.693 --> 18:39.412
Get these morons off the air. l'm warning you.

18:39.493 --> 18:43.247
- Ease up. Somebody gave you a break once.
- Even though you're a goon.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.211
l say we make this an open forum.
Let's hear the man out.

18:46.293 --> 18:50.002
Go ahead, Conan. Explain to Milo
why we should play your tape.

18:50.093 --> 18:53.563
l'm not pulling pud here.
My entire life force is on this tape

18:53.653 --> 18:57.282
and l don't know what else to say.
Come on, man, can you give us a shot?

18:57.533 --> 19:02.209
- How can you say no to that?
- You're on thin ice. You're not untouchable.

19:02.293 --> 19:06.081
- You think you are, but you're not.
- Get out. Without me you have no ratings.

19:06.173 --> 19:08.926
We'll see about that.
Let's go. Out! All you losers.

19:09.013 --> 19:13.006
- Get your hands off me, Jackson.
- You wanna try gettin' physical with <i>me?</i>

19:13.573 --> 19:18.772
Listen, you shaved ape, l could have you
picking up garbage for the rest of the decade.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.048
You wanna get smart with me? Try it.

19:21.133 --> 19:24.443
l will not be pushed around
by Hollywood Boulevard trash like you.

19:24.533 --> 19:26.524
l'm trash?

19:26.973 --> 19:29.009
You think you're better than me? Huh?

19:29.093 --> 19:31.891
- Oops.
- He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

19:31.973 --> 19:33.770
Hey, stop squirming, pussy!

19:33.853 --> 19:38.722
l'll fill your face so full of lead,
you'll be shitting bullets for a week!

19:39.013 --> 19:41.481
- Come on, Rex.
- Shut up.

19:41.573 --> 19:44.963
- lan, you wanna talk to these fellas?
- What do you suggest?

19:45.053 --> 19:48.170
- Say something. They like you.
- Shut up, dick-smoke!

19:48.253 --> 19:50.528
Chazz, come on.

19:51.693 --> 19:55.925
All right. You would've been cool, but
then this <i>penis</i> had to step in and get heavy.

19:56.013 --> 19:58.368
All we wanna do is to be heard, and then go.

19:58.453 --> 20:00.728
Believe me, l understand. Just cool it, huh?

20:00.813 --> 20:03.771
Why don't you cut your losses?
You're in over your head.

20:03.853 --> 20:08.529
Shut your face! Just shut your stupid face!
l know exactly what l'm doing.

20:08.613 --> 20:13.289
That's the problem with you guys. You think
cos you have a big job you know something.

20:13.533 --> 20:17.890
- Wrong! You got Hagar slacks, a pony-nub.
- Bet it ain't even real.

20:18.533 --> 20:20.683
Hey, hey, hey. Just cool it, huh?

20:23.813 --> 20:26.805
Hey, guys, we're all rock'n'rollers here.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.407
You look like half a butt-puppet that...

20:29.493 --> 20:32.769
Do you know what it's like to be
on the bill, play for 15 minutes,

20:32.853 --> 20:35.526
and the only people there
are the other bands?

20:35.613 --> 20:39.447
Don't talk to me about rock'n'roll!
l'm out there in the clubs living it!

20:39.533 --> 20:41.205
l <i>am</i> rock'n'roll!

20:41.293 --> 20:44.569
lt's guys like you and Jimmie Wing
that ruin everything

20:44.653 --> 20:47.725
- <i>for everyone.</i>
- Jimmie, they're talking about you on KPPX.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.405
Come here.

20:49.493 --> 20:53.202
<i>Then you realise there's a million</i>
<i>of these Jimmie Wing bone-smugglers.</i>

20:53.293 --> 20:55.523
<i>These guys are running the industry</i>

20:55.653 --> 20:58.770
<i>and they don't know</i>
<i>a damn thing about rock'n'roll!</i>

21:02.613 --> 21:04.205
OK.

21:07.693 --> 21:08.682
Hello. Police.

21:08.773 --> 21:13.403
l'll tell you what, Mr Programme-Director
Man, you put our goddamn tape on the air.

21:13.493 --> 21:17.008
lt's gonna get some airplay or
my man's gonna gank you here and now!

21:17.093 --> 21:19.891
- Shit, yeah.
- Well, let's not go ganking anyone.

21:19.973 --> 21:23.443
- Um, if we play the tape, will you go?
- That's all we need, d-cheese.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.763
Play the thing, Milo. Do what he says.

21:25.853 --> 21:28.242
Play it! What are you waiting for?

21:28.973 --> 21:32.170
- Sorry about all this. Enjoy.
- l can't wait.

21:32.653 --> 21:36.441
We can't play this tape.
We're only set up for CDs and cassettes.

21:37.253 --> 21:39.289
We should've brought a cassette.

21:39.373 --> 21:43.366
A cassette makes my background vocal
sound like someone's stepping on my nuts.

21:43.453 --> 21:47.207
- God. Mr Perfectionist.
- Quit necking. All we got was a quarter-inch.

21:47.293 --> 21:50.490
There's gotta be a reel-to-reel.
Find it. lt's a radio station.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.004
Yeah. That's it there.

21:58.053 --> 22:00.567
Milo, didn't l tell you
to knock when you come in?

22:00.653 --> 22:04.168
Just keep quiet and get that
reel-to-reel deck down to the booth.

22:04.253 --> 22:09.771
Telling me to shut up now? A brother can't
talk without the white man slap him down.

22:09.853 --> 22:11.844
Just do it, Marcus!

22:13.733 --> 22:14.529
Damn.

22:23.373 --> 22:28.766
White man with a gun. Same shit been
happenin' to my people for 425-odd years.

22:29.853 --> 22:31.844
Hey, you like working here, man?

22:33.053 --> 22:35.886
We're down, man. Hendrix was God.

22:35.973 --> 22:39.329
You wanna take a step back?
You're standing on my dick, man!

22:39.413 --> 22:43.167
Yeah, l seen that. Anthrax and Public
Enemy, that was outta control, man.

22:43.253 --> 22:46.404
Together, you know. You catch that one, G?

22:46.493 --> 22:48.290
Don't call me G.

22:48.373 --> 22:50.841
- What do you want me to call you?
- Hey, come on.

22:50.933 --> 22:52.605
All right, that's it.

22:52.693 --> 22:56.572
l can't wait for you to put that gun down,
cos when you do we're gonna throw down.

22:56.653 --> 22:59.451
That's right. We're gonna get serious.
<i>Mano a</i> swine.

22:59.533 --> 23:02.445
Hey, look, just shut
your pie hole and keep working.

23:02.533 --> 23:05.206
Pie hole? That supposed
to be some Cracker slang?

23:09.933 --> 23:11.924
Come on, let's go.

23:14.253 --> 23:15.208
Agh!

23:28.533 --> 23:29.932
Ooh! Ooh!

23:33.973 --> 23:36.168
You can't smoke here, babe.

23:36.253 --> 23:37.925
Yeah? What am l doin' now?

23:38.413 --> 23:42.122
You should put it out.
The smoke could damage the equipment.

23:46.093 --> 23:47.572
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

23:47.653 --> 23:49.848
OK, give us a real nice intro.

23:49.933 --> 23:53.812
And don't say anything about us
having a gun to your head.

23:53.893 --> 23:56.282
- OK, who are you guys?
- My name's Pip.

23:57.213 --> 24:00.728
- The band. The <i>band</i> name.
- Sorry about that.

24:00.813 --> 24:04.567
- He doesn't wear a helmet, does he?
- lt's right there on the box. Read it.

24:05.173 --> 24:07.687
''The Lone Rangers.'' That's original.

24:08.973 --> 24:12.682
- How can you pluralise ''The Lone Ranger''?
- What's wrong with that?

24:12.773 --> 24:15.970
Well, there's three of you.
You're not exactly lone.

24:16.053 --> 24:18.965
Shouldn't you be The <i>Three</i> Rangers?

24:21.253 --> 24:24.051
l've no idea what you're saying right now.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.852
- You lost me.
- Forget it, lan. Just play the thing!

24:26.933 --> 24:29.322
Yeah, forget it. Come on, just play it.

24:30.413 --> 24:34.565
Listen up, guppies, lan the Shark is back
and have l got a surprise for you.

24:34.653 --> 24:37.213
l've got goose bumps, frankly.

24:37.293 --> 24:39.887
For the first time ever, l'm willing to bet,

24:39.973 --> 24:45.366
here's that hit single by The Lone Rangers.

25:00.653 --> 25:03.929
- Turn it off! Come on, man.
- What did you do? What you doing?

25:04.013 --> 25:09.167
- Tonto must have loaded the tape in wrong.
- Hey, your machine dilapitatled it, man.

25:09.253 --> 25:10.845
Hey!

25:11.373 --> 25:13.364
Oh, what?! Hey! Oh!

25:14.493 --> 25:17.166
- Hey, that's my jacket!
- Put it out!

25:17.253 --> 25:18.845
Please!

25:20.373 --> 25:23.604
- Oh, man. The demo's wasted.
- What are we gonna do now?

25:24.213 --> 25:26.010
Run!

25:27.773 --> 25:29.365
lt's the inbreeding.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.604
Go! Go! Go!

25:43.813 --> 25:45.610
- Man.
- How'd they know we were here?

25:45.733 --> 25:49.931
l don't know. l don't know.
OK. Look, maybe they're just on patrol.

25:50.013 --> 25:52.447
All right, we didn't do nothing, right?

25:53.413 --> 25:55.643
- What?
- You go.

25:55.733 --> 25:57.530
You guys suck.

25:58.413 --> 26:00.927
Everything's all right. lt's cool.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.244
Let me in! Let me in!

26:29.213 --> 26:31.568
l don't wanna go to jail. l'm fragile.

26:35.773 --> 26:37.570
Go!

26:39.053 --> 26:40.645
Argh!

26:47.493 --> 26:49.927
Shit! We're surrounded.

26:50.013 --> 26:53.449
Why don't we give ourselves up?
We could say we were joking around.

26:53.533 --> 26:56.445
They'll cart us off
before you can say ''Rudolph Redpecker''.

26:56.533 --> 27:00.572
- Well, you didn't have to break out the gun.
- They wouldn't play the tape.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.450
- You didn't have to do that!
- Shut up.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.569
- You shut up!
- Both of you shut up!

27:04.653 --> 27:07.690
lf we go outside, we get roped.
We stay and figure it out.

27:07.973 --> 27:09.565
Excuse me?

27:09.933 --> 27:12.003
- Oh, jeez.
- More people. OK.

27:12.093 --> 27:16.325
We round everyone up, put 'em in the station
and nobody leaves until we figure this out.

27:16.533 --> 27:18.842
What was she on the Clydesdale scale?

27:19.533 --> 27:24.561
Yeah, that's where you gotta figure how many
Clydesdales it'd take to tear her off your face.

27:24.653 --> 27:26.769
Later. Let's go.

27:28.133 --> 27:32.251
l knew from looking at him
that he was a bomb about to go off.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.642
A big fat media bomb!

27:34.973 --> 27:37.089
They're gonna be all over the news now.

27:37.173 --> 27:40.563
<i>Time</i> magazine, <i>Larry King Live.</i>

27:40.653 --> 27:42.883
lf the song's in English, it's a gold record.

27:42.973 --> 27:44.964
Come on, come on, let's go.

27:46.213 --> 27:48.010
Hi again.

27:48.093 --> 27:49.128
Hi.

27:49.213 --> 27:52.410
Hey, hey, you guys think
you're gonna waste anybody?

27:52.493 --> 27:55.883
Cos if you are, pop Milo first.
That guy's a bozo de luxe.

27:55.973 --> 27:57.884
Uh-huh? Go.

28:09.013 --> 28:11.686
Perhaps it won't be long
until this thing blows over.

28:15.213 --> 28:17.010
Argh!

28:19.653 --> 28:21.450
Argh!

28:26.173 --> 28:28.926
All right, everybody on the floor right now.

28:30.733 --> 28:34.203
Do you mind if l sit in a chair?
l don't wanna get all cruddy.

28:35.093 --> 28:38.085
- Uh, yeah.
- Thank you.

28:38.173 --> 28:41.290
lf she doesn't sit on the floor,
l don't know why l have to.

28:41.373 --> 28:43.603
You heard the man.
Hit the deck or l smoke you.

28:43.693 --> 28:48.528
Sit down on the floor now! Everybody else
gets to sit in a chair except for you.

28:52.293 --> 28:54.090
Are we still on the air?

29:10.053 --> 29:13.329
- Have you made contact?
- No. One guy came out, but he went back in.

29:13.413 --> 29:16.132
Have Dispatch give us their number.
Let's call them.

29:16.653 --> 29:20.566
- You getting this, Wilson?
- Establish contact, ensure it's no false alarm.

29:20.653 --> 29:22.769
l know the procedure.

29:26.093 --> 29:29.563
- Could l get something to eat, man?
- You hungry, buddy?

29:29.733 --> 29:32.167
Hey, Chazz. Chazz.

29:32.253 --> 29:34.130
What?

29:41.613 --> 29:44.844
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- That guy says he's hungry.

29:44.933 --> 29:47.652
Who gives a shit?!
l'm trying to think here, OK?

29:57.773 --> 30:00.287
KPPX, where the action never stops.

30:00.853 --> 30:02.844
Oh, hi.

30:03.373 --> 30:07.810
Well, there's three psychotic musicians
with guns. How would <i>you</i> feel?

30:08.413 --> 30:10.643
l have no idea.

30:10.733 --> 30:12.724
The leader? Hold on.

30:13.693 --> 30:15.968
lt's the police.

30:16.053 --> 30:18.044
They wanna talk to you.

30:21.093 --> 30:23.209
He doesn't wanna talk.

30:23.293 --> 30:27.491
What am l supposed to do, beg him?
What are you doing to get us out of here?

30:28.533 --> 30:30.524
OK, fine.

30:31.893 --> 30:34.123
He wants you to go out and talk to him.

30:34.613 --> 30:36.444
Bag that. What for?

30:36.573 --> 30:39.371
He wants to know your demands
for releasing the hostages.

30:39.453 --> 30:43.412
- Oh, my God!
- Demands? What's he mean by ''hostages''?

30:44.133 --> 30:48.285
l've got a reality check for you, curly.
What you're doing is a felony, maybe worse.

30:48.373 --> 30:52.605
- What are your demands?
- Nothing. l just don't wanna go outside.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.724
OK. Come here, come here.

30:56.413 --> 31:00.008
- What do we need?
- A hockey stick up the backside of his head.

31:00.093 --> 31:02.732
l'm warning you. Don't bring Chazz down!

31:03.053 --> 31:05.044
Thank you, Rex.

31:05.813 --> 31:09.249
All right. Now, what do we want?

31:09.613 --> 31:11.604
Uh, Chazz?

31:22.973 --> 31:25.009
l like your hair.

31:25.373 --> 31:28.445
- What's that?
- My name's Suzzi, with two <i>z's.</i>

31:28.533 --> 31:30.012
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

31:30.173 --> 31:33.290
So you, like, answer the phones
and all that stuff?

31:33.373 --> 31:36.251
Mm-hm. Yeah, for, like, six hours a day.

31:36.333 --> 31:38.051
Oh, what a drag, huh?

31:40.093 --> 31:44.325
l understand you're trying to make
a statement, but this is getting out of hand.

31:44.413 --> 31:47.803
Hey, come on, you know where
l'm coming from. Be a sport, will ya?

31:47.973 --> 31:51.886
All right, but can we move this along?
Now, why did you come here?

31:51.973 --> 31:56.251
l came here for a lousy three minutes
and 31 seconds of airplay. That's it.

31:56.333 --> 32:01.532
Fine. Now there's cops outside with guns,
and you're holding people hostage, right?

32:01.613 --> 32:04.923
- Uh, yeah.
- On top of that, your tape is destroyed.

32:06.093 --> 32:09.449
So, there's only one thing that you can do.

32:12.453 --> 32:14.887
Get the other copy of the demo.

32:14.973 --> 32:16.565
Yeah!

32:16.933 --> 32:18.525
Rex!

32:26.533 --> 32:27.602
Bastard!

32:30.693 --> 32:34.003
<i>You called on the phone</i>,
<i>but we're not at home.</i>

32:34.093 --> 32:38.211
<i>Leave a message for Chazz. We'll call you</i>
<i>back soon</i>, <i>so don't have a spaz!</i>

32:41.653 --> 32:44.213
Come on, come on.
Stay back now! Back there!

32:44.293 --> 32:46.170
Hold it! Hold it!

32:46.373 --> 32:48.204
l want you to control this crowd.

32:48.293 --> 32:51.729
lf they give you any trouble,
cuff 'em and throw 'em in the squad car.

32:51.813 --> 32:55.089
Technically l can't do that, Sergeant.
The Civilian Review...

32:55.173 --> 32:59.769
l know what the Civilian Review Committee
says, but they're not doing crowd control.

32:59.853 --> 33:04.324
Listen, when you're in the line of fire
you do what's necessary to get the job done.

33:04.413 --> 33:09.282
You don't break the law but occasionally you
bend it. When that time comes, improvise.

33:09.373 --> 33:09.885
Yes, sir.

33:12.733 --> 33:14.724
Cover me.

33:17.013 --> 33:20.767
Get your hands up over your head.
Get down on the pavement! Get down!

33:20.853 --> 33:22.286
- What the f...
- Sergeant.

33:22.373 --> 33:24.364
What?

33:24.453 --> 33:27.843
You men, back off. Get back,
goddammit! Put those guns down!

33:27.933 --> 33:31.642
lt's OK. You can get up when...
Goddammit, get back!

33:31.733 --> 33:34.247
What the hell is this?
You invited me to come out!

33:34.333 --> 33:37.882
You surprised us. l'm Sergeant O'Malley.
l'm here to work with you.

33:37.973 --> 33:40.726
- What's your name?
- My rhythm section's watching me!

33:40.813 --> 33:43.008
Nobody's gonna hurt you. Everybody OK?

33:43.093 --> 33:47.132
- They're all fine. My name's Chazz.
- Great. lt's good to meet you, Chazz.

33:47.213 --> 33:49.568
Tell me what l can do to get you to end this.

33:49.733 --> 33:53.203
- You gotta find my tape.
- Sure. OK. What kind of tape is it?

33:53.293 --> 33:55.727
lt's a demo tape. We wanna play it on the air.

33:55.813 --> 33:59.089
You wanna play this tape on the radio,
then you'll come out?

33:59.173 --> 34:03.644
Right. The machine inside ate the original.
My girlfriend's got the only other copy.

34:03.733 --> 34:07.965
- Give me her number. l'll call her.
- l already tried that. She's off for the night.

34:08.053 --> 34:10.408
- You're gonna have to find her.
- Where is she?

34:10.493 --> 34:13.451
l don't know. Try the Strip somewhere.
Maybe The Whisky.

34:13.973 --> 34:15.964
She's...

34:16.053 --> 34:19.045
She's totally pissed at me, but...

34:19.733 --> 34:22.929
ls that her? She's a real looker.

34:23.813 --> 34:24.609
Yeah.

34:25.172 --> 34:27.368
Why don't black people like me?

34:27.813 --> 34:32.170
- Excuse me?
- lt's just that l listen to a lot of rap music,

34:32.253 --> 34:34.322
and l know how angry black people are.

34:34.413 --> 34:37.563
And l feel bad for all you guys
gotta put up with.

34:37.652 --> 34:39.688
Well, that's very nice of you.

34:39.773 --> 34:44.005
How about when you go into a store
and all the clerks start starin' at you

34:44.092 --> 34:48.371
like you're gonna rob the place and
you're like ''l just wanna buy something''?

34:48.453 --> 34:50.842
That's never happened.
Does that happen to you?

34:50.933 --> 34:55.643
Ah, no, but l'm just saying
that would be bad if it did.

34:55.733 --> 34:57.610
Look at Chazz doing his thing.

34:57.693 --> 35:00.161
Listen, Chazz,

35:00.253 --> 35:02.528
this is gonna take some time, OK?

35:02.613 --> 35:06.765
You have to send out one of the hostages
just as a sign of good faith. That's my rules.

35:06.853 --> 35:10.766
All right, fine. You have
your orders, Chief. Now get cracking.

35:18.853 --> 35:21.287
lt's more like power slop, but with an edge.

35:22.733 --> 35:25.167
OK. The cops are going to get Kayla.

35:25.253 --> 35:28.563
l cut a deal with them.
We've gotta send one person out.

35:29.133 --> 35:30.930
Please.

35:31.013 --> 35:32.810
l'll go.

35:32.893 --> 35:34.485
- A hostage, doof.
- Sorry.

35:34.573 --> 35:38.009
But not me, man. lt's just too cool.

35:38.093 --> 35:40.527
Why don't we let Yvonne go, man?
She's very nice.

35:40.613 --> 35:44.526
Wait a minute. l don't see why you
automatically have to choose a woman.

35:45.093 --> 35:47.687
Well, it's kind of sexist, don't you think?

35:47.773 --> 35:49.923
l mean, we could draw straws.

35:50.173 --> 35:52.289
- We could...
- OK.

35:52.453 --> 35:55.490
Yvonne, go. You'll be home
in time for <i>The Simpsons.</i>

35:55.893 --> 35:57.963
Stay strong, sister.

35:58.053 --> 35:59.691
Congratulations.

36:00.413 --> 36:05.612
Hey, butterball, l think you're exceeding
the maximum weight limit for that belt.

36:12.053 --> 36:14.442
Wilson, get over here!

36:17.933 --> 36:23.212
l'm sending out a sweep of Sunset Strip for
the girlfriend. l want you there to supervise.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.005
Whoa.

36:25.093 --> 36:27.448
Oh, God. Oh, God.

36:27.613 --> 36:29.649
Oh, God. Oh, God.

36:45.973 --> 36:49.409
- Whoa, look, we got fans.
- l didn't know that many people knew us.

36:50.493 --> 36:51.892
Hey, hold this. Thanks.

36:52.773 --> 36:54.764
Hey!

37:06.973 --> 37:09.965
- l'm gonna miss Yvonne.
- Let me tell you something.

37:10.053 --> 37:13.523
Don't chitchat with them.
They're not buddies. They're hostages.

37:13.613 --> 37:14.841
l was trying to be nice.

37:15.533 --> 37:19.003
l know, but then every time you tell
somebody to get on the floor

37:19.093 --> 37:22.881
they're gonna be like ''Even me, Pip?
l thought we had something going.''

37:22.973 --> 37:25.726
You gotta scare these people.
Practise. Just try it.

37:25.813 --> 37:29.692
l just feel a little goofy trying
to be a badass with a water pistol.

37:29.773 --> 37:34.483
They don't know that. They think it's real.
Now show me what you got. Come on.

37:35.013 --> 37:38.085
OK. Get over there, please. Thank you.

37:38.853 --> 37:41.845
What are you, a crack baby?
Give me that. l'll show you.

37:41.933 --> 37:43.924
All right.

37:44.653 --> 37:47.611
Hey, you! You shut your mouth,
you bastard,

37:47.693 --> 37:50.730
or l'll stab your eyeballs out
and piss all over your brain!

37:50.813 --> 37:56.092
lt's gonna be a slaughterhouse, with bodies
flying through the air like dolls on fire!

37:56.173 --> 37:58.641
Oh, my God.

37:58.813 --> 38:01.202
- OK?
- OK, all right. Thank you.

38:02.933 --> 38:06.448
- All right, against the wall.
- Come on, tough, tough!

38:06.533 --> 38:10.526
- Seriously, move it.
- l'm not scared, Pip. Come on.

38:10.613 --> 38:13.605
- l'm gonna stab your heads off.
- With what? With what?

38:13.693 --> 38:15.285
- With my dick!
- Yeah!

38:15.373 --> 38:18.410
Yeah! Blood's gonna come out of your head

38:18.493 --> 38:22.486
and there's nothing you can do
about it cos l'm a madman!

38:23.493 --> 38:26.007
- That's good.
- lt kinda hurt my throat.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.402
Come on, come on, move, move.

38:35.373 --> 38:37.364
Shit! Here comes the cavalry.

38:38.773 --> 38:42.083
So she boots me out of my own house
and now l'm at the motor lodge.

38:42.173 --> 38:45.085
12 years of marriage and devotion
down the tubes.

38:45.253 --> 38:49.246
- Hello, O'Malley.
- They called you too soon. lt's solved itself.

38:49.333 --> 38:54.043
Good, cos l'm taking over the interior
perimeter. You and your boys can fall back.

38:54.133 --> 38:57.205
Like hell you are. Didn't you hear?
We don't have a situation.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.966
Well, what do you call
an office full of hostages?

39:00.053 --> 39:02.692
Mace, l'm in the middle of negotiations,

39:02.773 --> 39:07.005
and until l decide there are no options,
you don't use force.

39:07.093 --> 39:08.970
Well, OK, O'Malley.

39:09.053 --> 39:11.283
lt's your show.

39:12.973 --> 39:14.565
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

39:14.653 --> 39:16.848
- <i>May l help you</i>, <i>sir?</i>
- Hello.

39:16.933 --> 39:21.848
Please could you put me through to someone
on the scene. l don't have much time.

39:25.533 --> 39:27.330
Oh, Christ.

39:27.413 --> 39:31.326
Looks like you got your hands full,
Mr Hostage Negotiator.

39:31.413 --> 39:32.528
Let's go.

39:32.613 --> 39:35.810
l want those media people back.
Come on! Move it! Get it back!

39:35.893 --> 39:39.283
- Dispatch has another call from inside.
- Swell.

39:39.373 --> 39:43.082
Listen, you sick sack of swill,
if you hurt one single...

39:43.173 --> 39:45.368
- <i>l don't have much time.</i>
- What? Who is this?

39:45.453 --> 39:47.444
<i>Doug Beech. l work at the radio station.</i>

39:47.533 --> 39:51.890
- Speak up, Beech. Are they molesting you?
- <i>No</i>, <i>l'm hiding in the air-cooling system.</i>

39:52.213 --> 39:54.010
They don't know that l'm here.

39:54.093 --> 39:57.369
l want you to do something
but l can't let you put yourself at risk.

39:57.613 --> 39:59.490
- What?
- <i>You got any kind of training?</i>

39:59.573 --> 40:02.451
- l was in the merchant marines.
- Yeah, l copy that.

40:02.533 --> 40:05.172
- Get them away from the van.
- l was an accountant.

40:05.253 --> 40:07.244
Nah, you won't be held accountable.

40:07.333 --> 40:10.086
Listen, l want you to be my man inside.

40:10.973 --> 40:15.842
This is what l want you to do, Beech.
l want you to check in with me periodically.

40:15.933 --> 40:19.369
l want you to talk to me directly
and me only. l have a number for you.

40:21.173 --> 40:23.164
Check it out. Come on in.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.886
- l'm gonna clip us some Cs, dude.
- Sweet.

40:28.053 --> 40:32.922
We've got these guys by the short curlies.
We could demand free stuff from the cops.

40:33.013 --> 40:36.562
What am l talking about? There's
probably cool stuff here. Play track two.

40:36.653 --> 40:38.883
As long as we're here let's hear decentjams.

41:57.093 --> 41:59.561
Oh, yeah! This is the real Rebel Radio.

41:59.653 --> 42:03.487
The voice of the resistance:
this is Chazz speaking. Yo!

42:03.573 --> 42:06.133
Shit, man, you guys oughta to have fun.

42:06.213 --> 42:08.044
You can't cuss on the air.

42:09.253 --> 42:13.451
Hey, look at all the stuff we found.
There's $5,000 worth of backstage passes.

42:13.533 --> 42:15.888
- You guys scored.
- Can l bogart one of these?

42:15.973 --> 42:20.012
You've gotta see this. We've got CDs,
we've got T-shirts, we've got...

42:20.093 --> 42:22.482
Oh, what have we here?

42:22.573 --> 42:27.203
<i>Those sound like concert tickets to me.</i>
<i>What do you say we take a few calls?</i>

42:27.293 --> 42:29.090
You're on the air.

42:29.173 --> 42:31.448
Ooh, let's turn down your radio, asshole.

42:31.533 --> 42:34.411
<i>l'm sorry. l wanna talk</i>
<i>to the guy with the gun.</i>

42:34.493 --> 42:37.326
<i>l just said you're on the air</i>,
<i>numbnuts. So talk already.</i>

42:37.413 --> 42:41.964
<i>l want some tickets to that show with</i>
<i>Penelope Lovestocking and Crimson Shroud.</i>

42:42.053 --> 42:45.011
Oh, man, you actually listen
to that Seattle bullshit?

42:45.093 --> 42:48.005
- <i>Shroud rips</i>, <i>dude.</i>
- All right, bro, no problem.

42:48.093 --> 42:51.608
You gotta come down because
we've got free tickets to give away,

42:51.693 --> 42:56.084
but we are completely surrounded by cops.
We need some feedback here. Go.

42:56.173 --> 42:58.971
- You're on the air.
- <i>Whoa</i>, <i>am l on the air?</i>

42:59.053 --> 43:03.604
- <i>Come on</i>, <i>Butt-head</i>, <i>give me the phone.</i>
- Am l speaking English, dipshit?

43:03.693 --> 43:07.163
- <i>Come on</i>, <i>Butt-head! No way.</i>
- <i>Shut up</i>, <i>Beavis.</i>

43:07.253 --> 43:10.802
- So what do you guys want?
- <i>You guys are</i>, <i>like</i>, <i>The Lone Rangers</i>, <i>right?</i>

43:10.893 --> 43:13.805
- Yeah.
- <i>We saw you at The Wheel Well last month.</i>

43:13.893 --> 43:17.044
- <i>You suck.</i>
- Come down here and say that, you punks!

43:17.133 --> 43:22.446
- Yeah, you can kiss my ass.
- <i>Why don't you make the chicks get naked?</i>

43:22.533 --> 43:24.922
Usual crop of retards.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.928
Hey, guys, you're on TV.

43:28.853 --> 43:33.449
<i>A band of failed musicians lashing out</i>
<i>at the society that won't listen to them.</i>

43:33.533 --> 43:38.653
<i>Their target</i>, <i>the only capitalist edifice</i>
<i>their MTV-soaked minds recognise:</i>

43:38.733 --> 43:43.045
- <i>a rock'n'roll radio station.</i>
- Oh, man. This is complete bullshit.

43:43.133 --> 43:46.808
<i>..and l quote: ''White urban males</i>
<i>are the least likely to elicit tears</i>

43:46.893 --> 43:50.522
<i>from a city already beleaguered</i>

43:50.613 --> 43:53.685
- <i>The mayor is on holiday...</i>
- l'd like to croak that bitch.

44:27.453 --> 44:30.251
Mace, we have contact with the man inside.

44:32.853 --> 44:36.528
- Beech, is that you?
- They've got six hostages.

44:36.613 --> 44:39.889
- lt's three weirdos with Uzis.
- Outstanding, Beech.

44:39.973 --> 44:42.726
You just keep your eyes open
and your tail down.

44:43.053 --> 44:46.648
<i>Have you got any personnel at home</i>
<i>you want me to call</i>, <i>like a wife?</i>

44:46.733 --> 44:50.089
No, no, l don't even have a home.
l've got a condo.

44:50.173 --> 44:54.212
Listen, l guess l've just tried
to wait to meet the right woman.

44:54.293 --> 44:59.572
l guess l should have waited longer myself.
Let me tell you about the shrew l married.

45:00.093 --> 45:03.972
<i>l used to come home tired every night</i>,
<i>sometimes five or six in the morning.</i>

45:04.053 --> 45:06.442
<i>l dropped my underwear</i>
<i>on the floor one time</i>,

45:06.533 --> 45:11.687
had a teeny-weeny little skid mark in it.
You'd have thought l started World War Nine.

45:13.933 --> 45:16.208
- There you go.
- Thank you.

45:17.413 --> 45:20.291
You've really great arms.
You should show them off.

45:20.373 --> 45:22.443
How does he do that?

45:22.533 --> 45:25.809
Pip? He gets his hands
on more bumper than a body shop.

45:25.893 --> 45:29.124
With that ''l seem so stupid
l must be cute'' routine?

45:29.213 --> 45:33.365
That's the quiet cool.
Chicks, man, they just flock on it.

45:33.453 --> 45:37.651
Man, you got hot CDs here and l never hear
them. Why don't you ever play these guys?

45:37.733 --> 45:39.849
That's Milo's call. Why don't we play 'em?

45:40.013 --> 45:43.449
lf they're so hot, how come
they're not tearing up the charts, babe?

45:43.533 --> 45:46.172
Cos you never play 'em, babe. You suck.

45:46.253 --> 45:49.802
- What do you think, lan?
- To tell you the truth, l stick to the classics.

45:50.133 --> 45:52.852
Rock'n'roll's been all downhill
since Lennon died.

45:52.933 --> 45:57.563
My whole life, people have been cramming
this classic-rock crap down my throat.

45:57.653 --> 45:59.609
Think l give a shit about the Beatles?

45:59.693 --> 46:03.322
No offence, but today's music
doesn't have a whole lot to say.

46:03.413 --> 46:08.168
ls that right? So you're gonna tell me
that ''Purple Haze'' says something?

46:08.253 --> 46:11.484
Hey, lan, man, wait till
you hear our stuff. We kick ass.

46:11.573 --> 46:15.202
Swell. Yeah, l can't wait
to hear your brilliant song.

46:15.293 --> 46:18.569
Beats the shit out of the fruity music
you listen to, tough guy.

46:18.653 --> 46:22.089
He's got himself a whole crate of
Kenny G CDs and you're talking trash?

46:22.173 --> 46:24.050
A crate of CDs?

46:24.133 --> 46:27.603
He's got a stockpile of easy-listening
shit-shingles in his office.

46:27.693 --> 46:31.447
You don't even listen to music. What
are you doing with a whole crate of CDs?

46:31.533 --> 46:34.730
Those are free promos.
l use 'em as stocking stuffers.

46:34.973 --> 46:37.362
lt's the middle of July!

46:38.053 --> 46:43.252
Aloha out there in radio land.
This is Oedipus Rex on WKPP-Rex,

46:43.333 --> 46:45.801
comin' at ya, smooth-talking DJ terrorist.

46:45.893 --> 46:48.407
These guys rule.
You're gonna hear some new shit.

46:58.813 --> 47:01.043
There's a box of that crap right there.

47:08.373 --> 47:10.170
Yeah, dude.

47:32.933 --> 47:35.925
Blonde, wearing something tight and black.

47:36.893 --> 47:39.965
Great. Grand. Wonderful.

48:04.893 --> 48:07.487
Come on, fellas. Let's put a sock in it, OK?

48:26.493 --> 48:28.370
What the hell are these?

48:28.853 --> 48:32.084
They're shorts, lan.
You know, pants with little legs?

48:32.293 --> 48:34.124
And this?

48:34.613 --> 48:37.525
Hey, l don't have
to explain myself to you, man.

48:38.613 --> 48:41.173
- Come here.
- What? l'm right here.

48:44.493 --> 48:47.291
Speak to me. What's goin' down?

48:47.373 --> 48:49.125
OK, um...

48:49.213 --> 48:51.124
We're changing formats.

48:51.213 --> 48:53.886
Sunday at midnight
the station goes soft rock.

48:54.373 --> 48:59.367
- Rebel Radio's goin' soft?
- We're changing our name to The Rain.

48:59.453 --> 49:03.048
You know, ''Relax to the mellow
sounds of The Rain on KPPX.''

49:05.093 --> 49:08.085
That, and we're being forced to re-staff.

49:08.693 --> 49:11.366
- You pud!
- All those blow jobs for nothing.

49:11.453 --> 49:15.002
You're firing me, you little
snake-in-the-grass bastard?

49:15.093 --> 49:17.891
Where do you get the balls to fire me?

49:17.973 --> 49:21.932
This was handed down from above, lan!
l fought this kicking and screaming!

49:22.013 --> 49:26.245
You've just begun to kick and scream,
you snivelling putz. l'll kill you!

49:27.133 --> 49:28.930
- Agh!
- A fight!

49:32.813 --> 49:35.611
- Yeah!
- Ooh! Ow, my spine!

49:50.533 --> 49:52.524
You're Kayla!

49:52.893 --> 49:55.043
l need to talk to you about Chazz Darby.

49:55.133 --> 49:58.603
lf Chazz needs any bail money,
you can just tell him to forget it.

49:58.693 --> 50:03.687
Look, there's a situation down at Rebel Radio.
l'm gonna need to take you in.

50:03.973 --> 50:06.168
Look, Chazz says you've got a tape.

50:07.013 --> 50:08.332
Please!

50:08.413 --> 50:11.325
Hey, check out Barney Fife.

50:21.453 --> 50:24.968
Don't you think you're
out of your league, chunk-style?

50:26.053 --> 50:29.841
Look, l don't wanna have
to bring you boys in on a 148.

50:30.693 --> 50:32.888
That's obstruction.

50:38.613 --> 50:41.332
Now what are you gonna do about <i>that?</i>

50:46.853 --> 50:48.605
lmprovise.

50:48.693 --> 50:53.084
So she says to me ''He was only
cleaning the pool filter, Sniggles.''

50:53.173 --> 50:58.042
<i>And l'm thinking to myself ''lt's 7pm</i>, <i>he's</i>
<i>in dungarees and his equipment is bone-dry.''</i>

50:58.133 --> 50:59.930
<i>Pool filter</i>, <i>my ass!</i>

51:00.013 --> 51:05.770
Thing is, she could have left me for
a plastic surgeon, but a lousy pool cleaner?!

51:06.173 --> 51:09.483
<i>Kayla</i>, <i>if you're listening</i>,
<i>l really need that demo tape.</i>

51:09.573 --> 51:11.484
<i>You gotta get it to the station.</i>

51:11.573 --> 51:13.291
Dammit.

51:25.773 --> 51:27.923
Shoo, dog. Oh, shoo!

51:30.133 --> 51:31.885
Ugh.

51:44.613 --> 51:46.808
Now stay.

51:55.773 --> 51:58.367
Uh, 67 copies of <i>Moby-Dick.</i>

51:59.813 --> 52:02.646
- The movie or the book?
- They made a book out of that?

52:02.733 --> 52:04.849
- Yeah, l think so.
- Yeah, get the book.

52:04.933 --> 52:08.642
- What are you guys doing?
- We're taking the cops up on those demands.

52:08.733 --> 52:12.362
- We've got a killer list.
- Yeah. We ask for airplay and whatever else...

52:12.453 --> 52:15.889
..then we demand a bunch of weird stuff
so we can plead insanity later.

52:15.973 --> 52:18.771
- Where did this come from?
- Pip's idea.

52:18.853 --> 52:20.650
Way to go, Pip.

52:20.733 --> 52:22.769
You guys <i>are</i> crazy, man.

52:22.853 --> 52:25.242
You're all whoo-hoo and shit.

52:27.493 --> 52:31.008
- So, what else we got so far?
- Number one: airplay, underlined twice.

52:31.093 --> 52:33.561
Number two:
a helmet filled with cottage cheese.

52:33.653 --> 52:36.486
Number three: a Zon walnut bass
with a graphite neck.

52:36.693 --> 52:38.524
- Thank you.
- Hey! What about me?

52:38.613 --> 52:41.446
- Go for broke. lt's on the LAPD.
- Oh.

52:41.533 --> 52:45.845
- l want a PRS Guitar with the dragon inlay.
- Nice.

52:48.053 --> 52:49.611
l'm coming, you bastard.

52:49.693 --> 52:52.844
Number 13: naked pictures of Bea Arthur.

52:53.293 --> 52:55.727
- Excuse me?
- The chick from <i>The Golden Girls.</i>

52:55.813 --> 53:01.046
Look, l know who she is. l'm just a street cop.
How am l supposed to find all this stuff?

53:01.133 --> 53:03.328
A giant baby bottle? Give me a break.

53:03.413 --> 53:06.371
You better figure it out,
or it's curtains for everyone.

53:06.453 --> 53:11.243
Oh yeah, and we want a record contract, so
let's get some record executive here pronto.

53:14.533 --> 53:17.172
- What?
- Why'd you ask for a record contract?

53:17.253 --> 53:20.165
- That's what we want.
- You don't demand one from the cops.

53:20.253 --> 53:22.642
lt's gotta come unsolicited.

53:22.733 --> 53:26.043
- What's unsolicited?
- Forget it. Just forget it.

53:26.133 --> 53:28.488
What did l do? l'm just yankin' the guy.

53:28.573 --> 53:33.124
lt's one thing to goof around but we do have
a serious agenda here. Are you with that?

53:33.213 --> 53:35.204
- Yeah, l'm with that.
- Good.

53:40.413 --> 53:41.766
Moody.

53:44.213 --> 53:46.010
Pip?

53:46.813 --> 53:48.804
What are you thinking about?

53:49.613 --> 53:51.604
Swimming pools.

53:52.293 --> 53:56.809
- Swimming pools, huh?
- Yeah. l wish l was in one right now.

53:56.893 --> 54:01.887
The water's all clear and cool,
and you spin around in there like an egg.

54:04.453 --> 54:06.444
Do you have a girlfriend?

54:06.533 --> 54:08.125
Mm-mm.

54:08.213 --> 54:09.805
No?

54:11.053 --> 54:13.521
lt's kind of weird us meeting like this, huh?

54:13.613 --> 54:15.604
l don't know.

54:22.213 --> 54:25.444
- We got that background check in.
- Yeah, let me see this.

54:25.533 --> 54:30.926
''Chazz Darby, born Jerkwater, lowa.
Real name: Chester Ogilvie.''

54:31.373 --> 54:35.332
DMV says his occupation
is master of ceremonies.

54:35.413 --> 54:37.973
- Arrests?
- Just two tickets for helmet violation.

54:38.053 --> 54:41.363
Just another small-town punk
comin' out west to be a star.

54:41.573 --> 54:45.407
- Anything else?
- Yeah. The local PD just faxed us his picture.

54:48.133 --> 54:49.930
Chester.

54:50.013 --> 54:52.527
l'm giving you the same rate
as everybody else.

54:52.613 --> 54:55.605
l know it's steep, but think
how many people will listen.

54:55.693 --> 54:57.968
This is primo advertising.

54:58.493 --> 55:01.803
Yo, scumbag,
are you selling ads on our airtime?

55:01.893 --> 55:03.565
Hold on a second, Brad.

55:03.653 --> 55:06.247
D'you mind? l've got a station to run here.

55:06.733 --> 55:11.329
Yeah, l'm back. lf the cops kill him before
the spot runs, you'll get a complete refund.

55:11.413 --> 55:13.802
Oh! Uh, Brad.

55:13.893 --> 55:15.884
You just hung up on an important man.

55:15.973 --> 55:16.962
Agh!

55:29.213 --> 55:30.805
Oh.

55:32.173 --> 55:32.969
Help.

55:39.933 --> 55:42.686
D'you find anything in that van? Drugs?

55:42.773 --> 55:46.129
Nah, just some toys and
a bunch of pool-cleaning gear.

55:47.053 --> 55:50.363
Pool-cleaning gear?
Give me that damn phone.

55:50.453 --> 55:52.125
What? A gun!

55:52.213 --> 55:55.649
Affirmative. These cowboys
are more dangerous than l thought.

55:55.733 --> 55:59.408
Work your way up the vent ducts to the roof.
Two of my men will meet you there.

55:59.493 --> 56:02.007
- Yeah, but a gun?
- Mace out.

56:02.173 --> 56:05.848
Can l ask you something?
What's with you guys and these tattoos?

56:07.493 --> 56:10.087
Check it out. l got this barbed wire here.

56:12.533 --> 56:15.206
A gecko. And this one is so cool.

56:15.293 --> 56:18.729
lt's, uh, the Grim Reaper. See?

56:18.813 --> 56:22.965
l'm gonna get some more cash and
probably colour it in or put some chaps on it.

56:23.053 --> 56:29.686
You know, l can understand ''Mom''
or ''l Heart Wanda'', but why the Reaper?

56:30.053 --> 56:33.966
Well, it's like death is stalking me

56:34.053 --> 56:38.490
and it's telling me l better get
off my ass and get this band rolling.

56:38.573 --> 56:40.848
This is for real. l gotta cut a record.

56:40.933 --> 56:46.690
l figure l'm screwed up enough that l could
write a song that'll live on for ever

56:46.773 --> 56:49.128
and then after that it don't matter.

56:50.573 --> 56:52.609
You know?

56:54.573 --> 56:58.361
<i>OK</i>, <i>kiddies</i>, <i>listen up because</i>
<i>this is lan the Shark's final night at KPPX.</i>

56:58.773 --> 57:02.686
Special unscheduled announcement:
effective Monday, this station goes

57:03.053 --> 57:04.645
<i>easy listening.</i>

57:05.493 --> 57:07.768
<i>We're having a big farewell party tonight</i>,

57:07.853 --> 57:09.366
so come on down!

57:12.453 --> 57:15.172
As part of our final hurrah
we have a special segment:

57:15.253 --> 57:17.448
''Getting To Know Your Armed Assailant.''

57:17.533 --> 57:19.569
Now we have Chazz Darby here.

57:19.653 --> 57:22.486
Now, Chazz, you say
all you wanna do is be heard.

57:22.573 --> 57:26.009
Well, you've got the whole world listening.
What have you got to say?

57:26.093 --> 57:29.085
Well, l guess all we have to say
is that we wanna be heard.

57:29.173 --> 57:32.529
Yeah, well, we've kind of
established that. What else?

57:34.413 --> 57:36.927
Hey, man, you can't
be putting me on the spot.

57:37.013 --> 57:39.891
You want him to make a speech?
Who does he look like, Sting?

57:39.973 --> 57:45.331
OK, you've sold out the Forum, you're
standing in front of 20,000 screaming fans.

57:45.413 --> 57:48.610
- What are you gonna say to 'em?
- l'm gonna say

57:48.693 --> 57:50.968
rock'n'roll!

57:53.293 --> 57:55.488
Warp speed, Mr Sulu!

57:56.213 --> 57:58.010
Yeah.

57:58.213 --> 58:02.047
That's it? You'll scream ''Rock'n'roll''?
You're gonna go to jail for that?

58:02.333 --> 58:05.962
There's a saying, Milo:
''lf it's too loud, you're too old.''

58:52.893 --> 58:55.805
- Where are <i>you</i> goin'?
- You mind if l take a pee, man?

58:57.013 --> 58:59.004
Good luck.

59:01.093 --> 59:02.924
Don't forget to shake.

59:03.893 --> 59:06.009
Milo.

59:06.093 --> 59:08.732
What are <i>you</i> doing, you little buttnut?

59:08.813 --> 59:11.373
Milo, Milo, Milo.

59:11.453 --> 59:13.250
Milo!

59:14.853 --> 59:16.969
- Open the door, Milo.
- Quiet.

59:17.053 --> 59:18.691
l said open the door, Milo.

59:22.853 --> 59:24.445
- What was that?
- l don't know.

59:24.533 --> 59:28.811
- Don't yell at me, Milo.
- You're screwing on a $1,400 leather couch!

59:28.893 --> 59:32.169
You're so rude! You don'tjust
burst in here without knocking.

59:32.253 --> 59:35.450
- lf there is <i>one</i> stain on that couch...
- You'll what?

59:35.773 --> 59:38.606
Fire me? Well, guess what? l quit!

59:38.693 --> 59:43.244
Oh, don't. l don't want you to lose yourjob
over this. Milo, this was my bust.

59:43.333 --> 59:48.009
- A screamfest... Oh, Pip.
- Get your filthy shoes off my furniture!

59:48.133 --> 59:52.331
- Suzzi, you can leave right now.
- No, l can't, because l'm a hostage

59:52.413 --> 59:54.131
and Pip is my...

59:54.213 --> 59:56.488
Pip is my man with a gun.

59:56.573 --> 59:59.645
- And he says l get to stay. Right, Pip?
- Sorry, dude.

59:59.733 --> 01:00:01.963
Pip, put the monster away.

01:00:02.053 --> 01:00:03.850
Oh, now what?

01:00:04.373 --> 01:00:07.410
- All right, everybody back to the booth.
- Argh!

01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:15.051
Oh, please, no. Don't do this.
l can't take it, man. My aunt was buried alive!

01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:17.408
- Give it a rest.
- Not in the closet!

01:00:17.493 --> 01:00:19.802
- What are they doing?
- Messin' with our heads.

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:22.767
Chazz! Chazz. Guys.

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:26.766
- Hey, Chazz, let me in.
- Keep an eye on him, Pip.

01:00:27.733 --> 01:00:30.725
Chazz. Hey, guys. Chazz, let me in.

01:00:30.813 --> 01:00:34.089
- Who are you?
- Chris Moore, Capitol Records. Let me in.

01:00:34.173 --> 01:00:39.293
- l told you, man. Things are going our way.
- Take a few steps back from the door!

01:00:39.373 --> 01:00:41.364
And toss me some lD.

01:00:42.173 --> 01:00:44.289
- OK, here.
- How'd you find us?

01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:50.130
The cops told me you're looking for a record
contract. We've gotta take advantage of this.

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:52.807
- Yeah, what's that?
- Will you look? This is hot.

01:00:52.893 --> 01:00:56.772
- You're the hottest thing since Marky Mark.
- Marky Mark! That guy sucks.

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:59.925
OK, forget him.
There's magic here. Let's talk contracts.

01:01:00.013 --> 01:01:04.131
l promise you, someday we're gonna be
backstage at the Forum laughing about this.

01:01:04.813 --> 01:01:08.726
All right, what side did you take
in the big David Lee Roth-Van Halen split?

01:01:08.893 --> 01:01:10.531
- What?
- What a question.

01:01:10.613 --> 01:01:13.764
- What side did you take? Halen or Roth?
- Van Halen.

01:01:13.853 --> 01:01:16.651
- He's a cop.
- Later, bacon.

01:01:16.733 --> 01:01:22.171
Strictly ajudgment call. They sold a lot of
records after David left. One more question.

01:01:22.253 --> 01:01:26.246
Right, right, right. Who'd win
in a wrestling match, Lemmy or God?

01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:27.322
- Lemmy.
- Ah!

01:01:27.413 --> 01:01:30.485
- God.
- Wrong. Trick question. Lemmy <i>is</i> God.

01:01:30.573 --> 01:01:32.928
- Oh, come on.
- Get the hell out of here!

01:01:33.013 --> 01:01:35.288
Get out of here! Get out of here!

01:01:35.453 --> 01:01:38.968
What the hell is this, O'Malley?
Now you bring in a cop to try to kill me?

01:01:39.053 --> 01:01:41.487
ls that it? l'm not going nowhere, pal!

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:45.566
- You put the power back on.
- You're stirring the crowd up.

01:01:45.653 --> 01:01:47.564
l got free concert tickets here!

01:01:47.653 --> 01:01:50.008
For me and you and you...

01:01:50.093 --> 01:01:54.723
What the hell is going on? Get those
people outta here! Get 'em outta here!

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:57.890
l love a parade!

01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:04.884
Hey, man, check out all that poony! We could
parley this into a hummer! They love us!

01:02:04.973 --> 01:02:06.565
Yeah, they love us.

01:02:06.653 --> 01:02:11.283
- You put the power back on!
- No, l won't, Chazz. l'm drawin' the line there!

01:02:12.373 --> 01:02:15.888
- Yo, is everyone havin' a good time tonight?
- Yeah!

01:02:15.973 --> 01:02:18.771
Wanna see the cops shut this party down?

01:02:19.013 --> 01:02:22.289
So they got the cards. We got the numbers!

01:02:26.973 --> 01:02:29.771
Rodney King! Rodney King!

01:02:29.973 --> 01:02:33.010
Rodney King. Rodney King.

01:02:39.893 --> 01:02:41.724
Holy shit!

01:02:41.813 --> 01:02:44.373
Rodney King?
What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:44.453 --> 01:02:46.045
He's that guy.

01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:53.524
Rodney King!

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:58.006
All right, dammit!
Turn the goddamn power back on!

01:03:03.573 --> 01:03:05.291
Chazz! Chazz!

01:03:05.373 --> 01:03:08.251
Kayla! l tried to call you.
l'm sorry, it was my fault.

01:03:08.333 --> 01:03:10.528
No, l was being a bitch.

01:03:10.613 --> 01:03:13.764
Why don't you give it up, Chester?
You can talk it over later.

01:03:13.853 --> 01:03:17.562
- Stay out of this and get your hands off her!
- Why did he call you that?

01:03:17.653 --> 01:03:20.531
- Uh...
- There's a lot Chester didn't tell you about.

01:03:20.613 --> 01:03:24.128
- What's he talking about, Chazz?
- lt's, uh... He's, uh...

01:03:24.213 --> 01:03:27.444
Ah, shi... You, man...
Kayla, there's something l gotta tell you.

01:03:27.533 --> 01:03:29.728
What?

01:03:33.293 --> 01:03:35.727
l was a geek in school.

01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:37.810
l had really short hair.

01:03:37.893 --> 01:03:39.929
l played Dungeons and Dragons.

01:03:40.093 --> 01:03:43.051
l had a bug collection. l ate my boogers.

01:03:43.533 --> 01:03:45.569
My name's not Chazz.

01:03:46.333 --> 01:03:48.324
lt's Chester.

01:03:49.613 --> 01:03:51.968
And l understand if
you don't love me any more.

01:03:58.253 --> 01:04:00.130
l play D&D, too!

01:04:02.693 --> 01:04:04.809
l was editor of the school magazine.

01:04:04.893 --> 01:04:07.043
Yeah!

01:04:08.613 --> 01:04:12.049
l used to wear corduroy pants.

01:04:12.133 --> 01:04:14.522
l used to masturbate constantly.

01:04:16.773 --> 01:04:20.322
- We're with you, Chazz.
- l want your body!

01:04:32.013 --> 01:04:34.083
Hey, Chazz! Chazz!

01:04:46.573 --> 01:04:48.370
Whoo!

01:04:54.533 --> 01:04:57.445
OK, this is my girlfriend Kayla.
She brought the tape.

01:04:57.533 --> 01:04:59.330
- About time.
- What's happening?

01:04:59.413 --> 01:05:02.007
We're going on the air, Pip.
We're going live!

01:05:02.093 --> 01:05:04.402
Oh, whoa. What happened to this?

01:05:04.493 --> 01:05:06.085
lt fell off the nightstand.

01:05:06.413 --> 01:05:09.405
What did you do to my tape?
Can we even play this?

01:05:09.493 --> 01:05:12.451
Maybe if l clean it up and re-spool it. Christ!

01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:17.129
- l came all the way down here just to bring it!
- And you took real good care of it, Yoko!

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:18.805
OK, everybody, shut up!

01:05:18.893 --> 01:05:25.412
Chazz, l have been with you
almost as long as these two assholes!

01:05:25.493 --> 01:05:28.690
l think it's about time
they treated me with a little respect!

01:05:28.773 --> 01:05:31.162
This thing smells like piss, man.

01:05:31.253 --> 01:05:35.769
Kayla, l don't have time for this noise. Did
you come to bitch at Rex or to help us out?

01:05:35.853 --> 01:05:37.764
Cos you're being a complete...

01:05:41.573 --> 01:05:44.849
l can't believe this, after all l've done for you!

01:05:44.933 --> 01:05:47.527
And then you chew me out
in front of your friends!

01:05:47.613 --> 01:05:50.446
- You're acting like a spaz!
- Well, what about you?

01:05:50.533 --> 01:05:53.206
You go and pull this moron stunt.

01:05:53.493 --> 01:05:58.044
lf you would just think for one second
instead of trying to be little glory boy.

01:05:58.133 --> 01:06:00.363
- ls that so, huh?
- Yeah, that's so, Chester.

01:06:00.453 --> 01:06:02.011
You're outta here.

01:06:02.093 --> 01:06:04.323
- What?
- Get outta here! Get lost, all right?

01:06:04.413 --> 01:06:07.291
l got a million things to think about,
l don't need you, too.

01:06:07.373 --> 01:06:10.888
l'm a part of this. You wrote
that song for me. That's my song!

01:06:10.973 --> 01:06:13.771
l wrote that song before l even met you.

01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:21.804
You'd better go about your business.

01:06:27.613 --> 01:06:29.410
Go about your business.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.008
Nobody look at me!

01:06:41.813 --> 01:06:45.806
- My Christ! What are you doing?
- You don't even care.

01:06:45.893 --> 01:06:48.282
You don't even care what happens to me!

01:06:48.973 --> 01:06:52.807
What have l got? My guitar, my bike
and my woman. That's all l got in the world.

01:06:52.893 --> 01:06:55.726
And you keep kicking me out!
lt's making me insane!

01:06:55.813 --> 01:07:00.807
l figure if l get a record contract, l can
make it up to you. l'm doing this for you!

01:07:00.893 --> 01:07:03.043
l suppose now you're gonna say you love me.

01:07:03.133 --> 01:07:08.446
Come on! l'm holding a gun to a guy's head
just so the whole world can hear <i>your</i> song.

01:07:08.533 --> 01:07:10.524
ls that love or what?

01:07:11.133 --> 01:07:13.124
Tell me.

01:07:13.573 --> 01:07:15.962
- What do you want from me?
- Tell me.

01:07:20.293 --> 01:07:22.284
All right.

01:07:23.413 --> 01:07:25.847
- l love you.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:31.693 --> 01:07:33.684
What else can l say?

01:07:42.853 --> 01:07:44.844
Oh, God!

01:07:45.773 --> 01:07:47.764
Oh! Dammit!

01:07:50.893 --> 01:07:53.043
Well, that fried out most of the board.

01:07:53.133 --> 01:07:54.805
- Great.
- Shit!

01:08:01.413 --> 01:08:02.528
Goddamn.

01:08:49.973 --> 01:08:51.725
Hey, guys, bring in the stuff.

01:08:51.813 --> 01:08:53.804
Yeah!

01:08:58.653 --> 01:09:01.929
l can't believe
they actually found all this crap.

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:06.529
l don't know. Maybe we didn't
make the demands weird enough, huh?

01:09:06.613 --> 01:09:08.490
Man, these are my people.

01:09:08.573 --> 01:09:13.249
Hey, hey, we're partyin' in here. Whoo!
We got all kinds of beer.

01:09:17.893 --> 01:09:19.962
Am l rockin' or what?

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:25.130
Shit.

01:09:28.212 --> 01:09:29.487
Die, dog!

01:09:34.053 --> 01:09:36.247
lt's a plastic gun!

01:09:41.693 --> 01:09:42.886
Oh, my eyes!

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:53.206
lt's a plastic gun!

01:09:53.292 --> 01:09:54.885
A plastic gun?!

01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:57.885
Did you hear that?
lt's a plastic gun. We're moving in.

01:09:58.733 --> 01:10:00.803
Everybody get back to the booth!

01:10:02.213 --> 01:10:04.204
Hold it!

01:10:05.293 --> 01:10:06.772
Don't anybody move!

01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:16.732
Now back up against the wall
and put your hands above your heads.

01:10:37.493 --> 01:10:41.452
- lt's a real gun!
- Fall back behind the barriers.

01:10:41.533 --> 01:10:43.524
God help us all!

01:10:46.893 --> 01:10:49.851
lt's all right, Chazz.
Stay calm. We're pulling back.

01:10:56.693 --> 01:10:58.684
Body count! Body count!

01:11:06.413 --> 01:11:09.803
Everybody get back to the booth!
Get back! Hurry up!

01:11:09.973 --> 01:11:12.089
- Move it, move it, move it.
- Cockroach.

01:11:13.973 --> 01:11:15.770
Argh!

01:11:28.613 --> 01:11:30.763
- Hello.
- Yes, hello. Put the pig on!

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:35.610
- Chazz, is everybody OK?
- What the hell was that bullshit?

01:11:35.693 --> 01:11:39.481
- l'm gonna grease somebody in here, l swear!
- <i>Chazz</i>, <i>don't do anything crazy.</i>

01:11:39.693 --> 01:11:43.402
- What was all that firing?
- You tell me. You've got guys in the ceiling!

01:11:43.493 --> 01:11:47.202
Calm down. We don't have anybody
trying to break in. l wouldn't do that.

01:11:47.293 --> 01:11:51.206
OK, if this bullshit happens again,
l'm gonna start blasting!

01:11:51.293 --> 01:11:54.126
You have my word.
How long before you play your tape?

01:11:54.213 --> 01:11:56.249
Uh, how long?

01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:59.643
Uh, we're workin' on it.
l don't know, pretty soon.

01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:02.327
l'll have a record executive for you here soon.

01:12:02.413 --> 01:12:06.929
Now, you know my rules. How about
sending out another hostage just as a sign...

01:12:07.773 --> 01:12:11.971
- That guy in the ceiling, what was that?
- He says he doesn't know.

01:12:12.053 --> 01:12:15.841
- Man, back there, that was huge. Thanks.
- Rock'n'roll.

01:12:17.493 --> 01:12:19.404
Whoo. OK, who's got a Tic Tac?

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:29.324
Hello there, boys.

01:12:31.733 --> 01:12:34.406
Hi, Chazz. Jimmie Wing. Remember me?

01:12:34.493 --> 01:12:38.281
l wanted to get in touch with you,
but you didn't leave me your phone number.

01:12:38.373 --> 01:12:40.887
Yeah. Well, l figured you'd come around.

01:12:40.973 --> 01:12:44.204
This is the chimp from Palatine?
l told you, man. We scored.

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:47.683
- Hi there. Jimmie Wing.
- Hi. How are you?

01:12:47.773 --> 01:12:50.367
Bea Arthur. Outstanding.

01:12:53.973 --> 01:12:58.842
Can you believe it? A record exec came
all the way down here to meet you guys.

01:12:58.933 --> 01:13:00.924
- You have to be careful.
- Jimmie!

01:13:01.013 --> 01:13:04.289
Entertainment executives
make their living screwing people.

01:13:04.373 --> 01:13:06.682
- Got a proposition for you.
- Oh, shit.

01:13:06.773 --> 01:13:12.370
l know you think l'm a dick...cheese...burger,
or whatever, but you need a negotiator.

01:13:12.453 --> 01:13:16.241
l will offer my services for 10%
of the pretax gross. That's standard.

01:13:16.333 --> 01:13:18.483
Shine on that, Chazz. lt ain't worth it.

01:13:18.573 --> 01:13:21.246
Think about it.
These things can be very tricky.

01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:27.044
He's right. My ex-boyfriend Parker was
a model, and one time they stole his shoes.

01:13:30.133 --> 01:13:34.570
- He hasn't even heard the demo yet.
- Well, if he likes it, l'd like to help.

01:13:34.653 --> 01:13:36.166
What do you think, lan?

01:13:36.253 --> 01:13:40.326
No, he's right. But make that 5%, Milo,
you scum-sucking weasel.

01:13:40.413 --> 01:13:42.563
OK, done.

01:13:42.653 --> 01:13:45.213
- Untie me.
- You're doing so good, babe.

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:49.324
Now what?

01:13:53.013 --> 01:13:55.652
Hey, Rex. Rex, it's me. Rex!

01:13:55.733 --> 01:14:00.488
- That surfer guy wants to come back inside.
- What? Will you tell that guy to piss off?

01:14:01.573 --> 01:14:03.450
Guys! Guys!

01:14:05.533 --> 01:14:08.809
- Hey, no dice, man. Get outta here.
- Oh, come on, Rex.

01:14:08.893 --> 01:14:11.885
- l won't try anything.
- You shouldn't have escaped then.

01:14:12.173 --> 01:14:14.767
Come on, bro. l was havin' a blast!

01:14:14.853 --> 01:14:17.083
Come on, Rex. Rex!

01:14:17.373 --> 01:14:19.682
l wanna get a drum set
that goes underwater

01:14:19.773 --> 01:14:23.322
so in the middle of our show they can
dunk me in a tank and l can do my solo.

01:14:23.413 --> 01:14:25.210
Cool!

01:14:25.933 --> 01:14:28.811
l'm gonna get a leatherjumpsuit
with the crotch cut out.

01:14:28.893 --> 01:14:32.363
Rex, can you set up the sound system
so Jimmie Wing can hear the tape?

01:14:32.453 --> 01:14:34.967
- l'm just... l gotta...
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:14:37.693 --> 01:14:40.287
Hey, Rex, man. We're gonna go to jail, huh?

01:14:42.373 --> 01:14:46.002
Small price to pay to be a legend.
Remember when Ozzy pissed on the Alamo

01:14:46.093 --> 01:14:48.561
and was banned
from San Antonio for a decade?

01:14:48.653 --> 01:14:51.645
Did his time, went back, rocked the place.

01:14:51.733 --> 01:14:56.887
Section G, the force majeure, where it says
''riots, disturbance, war, acts of God'', etc.

01:14:56.973 --> 01:15:00.124
- What about it?
- Amend that to exclude this hostage crisis.

01:15:00.213 --> 01:15:02.727
That can be construed as
an act of public enemy.

01:15:02.813 --> 01:15:04.724
- Done.
- Where's the tape deck?

01:15:04.813 --> 01:15:06.804
Oh, why? We need that, too?

01:15:07.373 --> 01:15:09.045
- Let me see your arm.
- Why?

01:15:10.013 --> 01:15:11.446
Get it, retard.

01:15:54.653 --> 01:15:57.565
- The board's fried. l can't fix it.
- Oh!

01:15:57.653 --> 01:16:02.727
- No, lan. Come on, man, you gotta help me.
- There's nothing more that l can do.

01:16:04.573 --> 01:16:07.565
- This is it, babe.
- All set, Chazz.

01:16:07.693 --> 01:16:10.810
- Here we go, my man.
- This is so exciting!

01:16:10.893 --> 01:16:13.885
- Oh, my God. Here it is.
- All right.

01:16:13.973 --> 01:16:15.884
- Record contract?
- Uh-huh.

01:16:15.973 --> 01:16:18.009
We got a record contract!

01:16:18.093 --> 01:16:22.644
Everything's square. Just autograph it
on the last page and you got yourself a deal.

01:16:22.733 --> 01:16:25.327
Hah! We got a contract!

01:16:26.613 --> 01:16:28.763
We got a contract!

01:16:28.853 --> 01:16:30.844
We made it, babe. We made it.

01:16:33.453 --> 01:16:35.967
- Stop!
- Hey, man, what are you doing?

01:16:36.053 --> 01:16:38.203
Hey, bro, we got signed.

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:41.205
- Are you crapping me?
- Didn't you play the song for him?

01:16:41.293 --> 01:16:43.363
No. We didn't hook this thing up yet.

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:48.562
- So you two haven't heard the demo?
- l heard it on the radio earlier.

01:16:49.173 --> 01:16:52.449
You heard it for about five seconds
and then it got ate.

01:16:52.533 --> 01:16:54.410
Well, Chazz, my man,

01:16:54.493 --> 01:16:58.645
it's notjust the music, it's the way
you talk about it. You have such passion.

01:16:58.733 --> 01:17:02.248
- Whoa, whoa. What am l hearing?
- What's wrong, man?

01:17:04.533 --> 01:17:06.569
No deal. No.

01:17:06.653 --> 01:17:08.644
What are you talking about?

01:17:08.733 --> 01:17:11.964
No deal! Yesterday he kicks me
out of Palatine Records

01:17:12.053 --> 01:17:16.649
and today he has a record contract for me to
sign. He hasn't even heard my tape. No deal!

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:20.885
- But this is what you wanted!
- Wanna know what l think of your contract?

01:17:20.973 --> 01:17:22.964
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:17:27.773 --> 01:17:30.492
He wipes his ass with his record contract.

01:17:30.573 --> 01:17:33.849
- l love this guy.
- But we still have a deal, right?

01:17:33.933 --> 01:17:36.811
l wanna be a rock star someday
but on my own terms.

01:17:36.893 --> 01:17:40.602
Well, l got some news for you, big guy.
You already are a star.

01:17:40.733 --> 01:17:43.645
You can't buy this kind of media exposure.

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:46.527
We are sitting on a gold mine here.

01:17:46.693 --> 01:17:53.007
l am offering a long-term contract to get your
music out to millions, plus a whole lot more.

01:17:53.133 --> 01:17:55.931
Like what ''a whole lot more''?

01:17:56.013 --> 01:18:00.882
Ever since you signed this contract you've
been under the umbrella of Palatine Records.

01:18:00.973 --> 01:18:04.170
We have an army of attorneys
looking out for all our investments.

01:18:04.253 --> 01:18:05.811
Chazz,

01:18:06.013 --> 01:18:09.210
rock stars don't go to jail. Christ.

01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:12.330
Vince Neil only got 30 days
and he killed somebody.

01:18:12.413 --> 01:18:15.166
Hey, buddy, you swear you can get us off?

01:18:15.373 --> 01:18:19.332
l swear, if you guys play ball.
That's what l'm here for.

01:18:19.573 --> 01:18:22.963
Chazz, let's just play the tape on air.
They'll throw deals at us.

01:18:23.213 --> 01:18:26.762
Can't do that, man. Console's busted.

01:18:27.653 --> 01:18:29.644
lt's this or nothing.

01:18:35.093 --> 01:18:36.572
OK. Super-duper.

01:18:36.653 --> 01:18:38.803
We're making records.

01:18:39.853 --> 01:18:42.845
- What about the song? How we gonna play...
- Ah.

01:18:42.933 --> 01:18:44.924
l'm already ahead of you.

01:18:50.173 --> 01:18:53.051
Officer O'Malley. Jimmie Wing.

01:18:53.133 --> 01:18:56.842
What are you doing sending me in
with these animals? They're out of control.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:58.969
Yes. Yes.

01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:01.564
They have some more demands.

01:19:13.093 --> 01:19:17.371
We're gonna soon witness the culmination
of this extraordinary rock'n'roll drama:

01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:20.331
a live performance by The Lone Rangers.

01:19:20.413 --> 01:19:24.088
Wait a minute. That can't be right.
You can't pluralise ''Lone Ranger''.

01:19:24.213 --> 01:19:26.408
Get the guy who did the Guns N' Roses video.

01:19:26.493 --> 01:19:28.882
- Try for John Landis.
- Landis is huge.

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:30.167
This is great.

01:19:30.493 --> 01:19:35.248
This is a major media event. We have lights,
crowds... We are gonna bury Lollapalooza!

01:19:35.333 --> 01:19:39.770
- l said no!
- Look at the boots they gave me. Excuse me.

01:19:39.853 --> 01:19:43.732
- How is this? l feel kinda goofy.
- You look like an idiot.

01:19:58.733 --> 01:20:02.646
Remember, this only works if you still
have the hostages. OK, Kayla? Guns up.

01:20:02.733 --> 01:20:04.530
Hey, what about me?

01:20:11.693 --> 01:20:13.490
Oh, yeah!

01:20:16.253 --> 01:20:18.448
l love you, Chazz!

01:20:22.573 --> 01:20:25.610
This is a soggy dream come true!

01:20:25.693 --> 01:20:27.490
This is rockin'. Yeah!

01:20:29.853 --> 01:20:31.969
- All right!
- Whoo!

01:20:32.053 --> 01:20:34.044
Let's give it to 'em.

01:20:36.133 --> 01:20:38.124
Oh, yeah.

01:20:40.853 --> 01:20:42.969
Hey, man.

01:20:58.853 --> 01:21:01.765
- What?! lt's not turned on.
- They ain't givin' us no juice.

01:21:01.853 --> 01:21:06.768
The amps are props. We'll play your tape
through the PA system and you pantomime.

01:21:06.853 --> 01:21:09.970
- What, are you yankin' me?
- lf you don't do it this way,

01:21:10.053 --> 01:21:14.205
we won't be able to sync it up in post.
OK, Rex, lift up the gun so they can see it.

01:21:14.293 --> 01:21:18.730
- l ain't lip-syncing, man.
- lt's a video. People always lip-sync.

01:21:18.813 --> 01:21:23.125
- Oh, come on, this is bullshit.
- That's all we are to you, some freak show?

01:21:23.213 --> 01:21:26.171
For all you care our album
could be Pip farting on a snare drum.

01:21:26.253 --> 01:21:28.972
- Guys!
- l ain't fartin' on no snare drum.

01:21:29.053 --> 01:21:32.363
lf you guys don't do it, we don't have a deal.

01:21:32.453 --> 01:21:37.243
Me, and the lawyers from Palatine Records,
we walk. Now do you get that?

01:21:37.373 --> 01:21:39.250
All right. Come here.

01:21:39.533 --> 01:21:42.093
Come here. We can't do that.
Don't make us be lame.

01:21:42.173 --> 01:21:44.164
OK. Roll tape.

01:21:46.613 --> 01:21:50.242
Listen, dirthead,
shut your mouth and do what you're told.

01:22:15.533 --> 01:22:18.127
What are you doing? We're filming.

01:22:18.213 --> 01:22:19.851
Play, you little maggot.

01:22:19.933 --> 01:22:23.130
Jimmie, get out of there.
You're ruining my shot.

01:22:23.213 --> 01:22:26.888
Listen, l own you! l own you!

01:22:26.973 --> 01:22:31.967
Oh, yeah! You can't see nothin'
from back there, you filthy scumbags!

01:22:32.053 --> 01:22:34.283
Come on down!

01:22:35.573 --> 01:22:37.325
Come on! Let's go!

01:22:45.693 --> 01:22:47.684
Holy shit!

01:22:47.773 --> 01:22:50.651
- Back it up!
- Just get outta the way. Let 'em go.

01:23:04.693 --> 01:23:07.161
lt's total anarchy!

01:23:20.093 --> 01:23:22.926
- Whoo!
- Check it out, man. They dig our song.

01:23:26.693 --> 01:23:29.002
All right! Rock'n'roll!

01:23:59.093 --> 01:24:01.687
? What's Johnny doin' out
on a Tuesday night?

01:24:01.773 --> 01:24:04.162
? Johnny can't read, Johnny can't write

01:24:05.253 --> 01:24:08.051
? Kids just don't understand

01:24:09.133 --> 01:24:11.522
? Johnny don't care about the world

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:15.003
? As long as he can do his girl

01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:18.210
? And prove that he's a man

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:20.683
? Degenerated

01:24:20.853 --> 01:24:23.242
? Degenerated

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:25.688
? And our minds are

01:24:25.773 --> 01:24:28.082
? Vegetated

01:24:28.173 --> 01:24:30.243
? Degenerated

01:24:30.613 --> 01:24:33.002
- ? Degenerated
- Rex!

01:24:34.333 --> 01:24:36.324
What are you doin', man?

01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:40.328
? Degenerated

01:24:40.493 --> 01:24:43.212
? Degenerated

01:24:44.253 --> 01:24:48.041
We start touring in six months.

01:24:48.133 --> 01:24:50.567
Well, three months
if they behave themselves.

01:24:50.853 --> 01:24:53.242
? Degenerate, degenerate

01:24:53.413 --> 01:24:55.802
? Degenerate, degenerate

01:24:53.853 --> 01:25:13.447
