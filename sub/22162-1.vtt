01:35.261 --> 01:36.179
{\an1}I GAVE IT A CHANCE,

01:36.262 --> 01:37.388
{\an1}AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.265

40:09.573 --> 40:10.533
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Woman: JESSICA, END IT.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.952
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Kristin: ...YOU, BYE.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.453
{\an1}WHY ARE YOU DEALING WITH HIM?

40:14.537 --> 40:15.621
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Jessica: WAIT, NO, NO. STOP!

40:15.704 --> 40:16.872
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Kristin: WHY ARE YOU

40:16.956 --> 40:17.706
{\an1}DOING THIS?

40:17.790 --> 40:18.541
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Jessica: STOP IT!

40:18.624 --> 40:19.542
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Woman: JESSICA, IT'S JUST

40:19.625 --> 40:20.543
{\an1}GONNA PUT YOU IN A BAD MOOD.

40:20.626 --> 40:24.046
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Alex: GET OFF THE PHONE.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.381
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Kristin: JESS, HE FULLY HAS

40:25.464 --> 40:26.257
{\an1}THE UPPER HAND

40:26.340 --> 40:27.341
{\an1}IN THE RELATIONSHIP,

40:27.424 --> 40:28.259
{\an1}AND HE KNOWS IT.

40:28.342 --> 40:31.595
{\an1}BECAUSE YOU LET HIM.

40:42.398 --> 40:43.357
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Stephen: (laughs)

40:43.440 --> 40:44.233
{\an1}I GET IN THAT MOOD

40:44.316 --> 40:45.359
{\an1}EVERY TIME I'M IN HERE.

40:45.442 --> 40:46.777
{\an1}IT'S JUST, LIKE...

40:46.861 --> 40:50.072
{\an1}JUST GONNA DUNK YOU.

40:50.156 --> 40:54.535
{\an1}YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.080
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Stephen: I COULDN'T HAVE

40:58.164 --> 40:59.707
{\an1}CALLED IT ANY BETTER WHEN I SAT

40:59.790 --> 41:01.584
{\an1}RIGHT ABOUT THERE.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.294
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Lauren: WHAT?

41:03.377 --> 41:04.003
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN WE CAME HERE

41:04.086 --> 41:05.379
{\an1}THAT ONE DAY,

41:05.462 --> 41:06.297
{\an1}AND IT WAS JUST ALL EMPTY.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.464
{\an1}WE WENT AND SAT IN THE JACUZZI

41:07.548 --> 41:08.340
{\an1}SAYING, "I CAN'T WAIT

41:08.424 --> 41:10.134
{\an1}UNTIL THIS THING'S FILLED."

41:10.217 --> 41:11.051
{\an1}AND NOW IT'S FILLED,

41:11.135 --> 41:12.011
{\an1}AND WE'RE SITTING HERE.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.637
{\an1}IT SEEMS LIKE SO LONG AGO.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.723
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Lauren: IT WAS LONG AGO.

41:15.806 --> 41:16.682
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS SERIOUSLY,

41:16.765 --> 41:17.850
{\an1}LIKE, MY FAVORITE COUPLE OF FEET

41:17.933 --> 41:21.645
{\an1}IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

41:21.729 --> 41:22.813
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Woman: SO IS HE LYING TO YOU?

41:22.897 --> 41:23.939
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Kristin: JESSICA, HE KNOWS

41:24.023 --> 41:24.857
{\an1}THAT HE CAN LIE TO YOU.

41:24.940 --> 41:25.900
{\an1}I'M SORRY, I USED TO DO THIS

41:25.983 --> 41:27.109
{\an1}WITH STEPHEN ALL THE TIME.

41:27.193 --> 41:27.860
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Woman: JESS.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.153
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Jessica: COULD WE PLEASE

41:29.236 --> 41:30.029
{\an1}PUT ON MUSIC?

41:30.112 --> 41:31.071
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Woman: BE HAPPY.

41:31.155 --> 41:31.947
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Jessica: I AM.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.199
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Woman: YOU LOOK CUTE

41:33.282 --> 41:33.866
{\an1}IN THAT TOP.

41:33.949 --> 41:34.783
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Jessica: CHILL RIGHT NOW.

41:34.867 --> 41:35.784
{\an1}&gt;&gt; Kristin: YEAH, AND THERE WERE

41:35.868 --> 41:36.994
