WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.370
- This is not RuPaul's best
friend.

00:03.370 --> 00:04.438
- I feel very attacked.

00:04.438 --> 00:07.908
- If you don't have star
quality, get the fuck outta
here.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.776
- Oh my God.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.046
- This is Untucked.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.681
Backstage at the competition

00:14.681 --> 00:16.950
to become America's next drag
superstar.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.554
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.554 --> 00:22.689
you're only getting half the
story.

00:24.291 --> 00:27.094
- Break on the main
stage. All cameras repo.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.396
- Thank you ladies.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.298
While you untuck in the
workroom,

00:31.298 --> 00:33.700
the judges and I will
deliberate.

00:40.340 --> 00:43.310
- It's our very first runway
and I'm so excited to be here.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.144
Last season,

00:44.144 --> 00:46.680
Simone was Arkansas
first native to make it

00:46.680 --> 00:48.148
to RuPaul's Drag Race.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.750
And now I'm here to
follow in her footsteps

00:49.750 --> 00:52.052
and hopefully take the
crown back to Arkansas.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.821
- It was important for me to
make

00:54.821 --> 00:56.790
a really good first impression
on Rue.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.393
And I grew up doing
talent shows and stuff.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.763
So I'm thinking that I
have a really good chance

01:02.763 --> 01:04.765
of winning this challenge.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.334
- I am so excited to be here.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.270
I'm a little nervous because I
chose like,

01:10.270 --> 01:13.407
the most basic drag talent
I could possibly choose.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.109
But you know, nerves can be a
good thing.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.278
And that's what I just
keep telling myself.

01:19.146 --> 01:19.980
- Queens walking.

01:19.980 --> 01:23.050
- Sending the Queens in 3, 2, 1.

01:24.818 --> 01:28.488
- Woowee, oh my fucking God.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.489
- Cocktails!

01:30.424 --> 01:32.292
- I love a nice cock and a tail.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.127
- Yes!

01:35.529 --> 01:37.364
Okay so it's our first untucked,

01:37.364 --> 01:39.232
and I am very excited to be
here.

01:39.232 --> 01:40.934
I'm very excited to sit down on
the couch

01:40.934 --> 01:42.369
with the other girls and get to
know them

01:42.369 --> 01:43.203
a bit better.

01:44.338 --> 01:48.308
- Oh my God. Well, ladies,
that was our first runway.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.142
Let's do a cheers.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.344
- [ALL] Cheers!

01:51.278 --> 01:53.347
- To season 14!
(all cheering)

01:53.347 --> 01:55.015
- All right!

01:55.015 --> 01:56.016
- Do we want to go down the line

01:56.016 --> 01:58.085
and see how everybody's
feeling and all that stuff?

01:58.085 --> 02:00.787
- Daya, how are you feeling,
like.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.523
- I know, like, I don't
have tons of money.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.625
I don't have expensive gowns.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.394
I'm, I'm not that kind of girl.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.228
- Same.

02:08.228 --> 02:09.930
- My shit's fuckin' falling
apart,

02:09.930 --> 02:11.598
but like, I mean, I'm proud of
it,

02:11.598 --> 02:13.300
even though my titty's hangin'
out.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.570
- Let the nipple free.
- Free the nipple.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.404
- You know,

02:17.404 --> 02:19.539
I felt like they more or
less liked how I looked.

02:19.539 --> 02:22.809
So, there's a little
hope there, but I mean,

02:22.809 --> 02:25.779
it's like just kind of sad
to me to hear Ru say, like,

02:25.779 --> 02:28.081
he doesn't know who I am.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.249
Cause it's like,

02:29.249 --> 02:31.585
it took me such a long time
to figure out who I was.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.687
And I feel like I'm so
confident in who I am,

02:33.687 --> 02:36.757
and not being able to portray
that to Ru

02:36.757 --> 02:38.959
is really disheartening to me.

02:38.959 --> 02:42.129
And like, if I gotta fuckin' lip
sync,

02:42.129 --> 02:43.630
I'm gonna fuckin' do it.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.799
If my shit falls off my body,

02:45.799 --> 02:49.803
I'm going to just show 'em
my titties and let it go.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.338
- It's not a tear away, it's a
fall apart.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.041
- Yeah.
- And it's still a reveal.

02:54.041 --> 02:57.778
- Whatever happens like, you
right now look so beautiful.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.413
- No everyone looks amazing.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.514
- I mean, I know.

03:02.816 --> 03:03.984
- Matty, how are you feeling?

03:03.984 --> 03:05.218
- I honestly don't know how to
feel.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.421
I got like a lot of
critiques from the judges.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.589
During my number I was
really trying to like,

03:09.589 --> 03:10.791
show like emotion.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.826
So I thought that if
I was getting into it,

03:12.826 --> 03:14.428
that would make a better
performance,

03:14.428 --> 03:16.496
and it actually hurt me.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.598
And I feel like it's like 50/50
chance

03:18.598 --> 03:20.534
like I'm lip syncing tonight.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.002
- You're not giving
yourself enough credit.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.871
Like, you're the only one that's
like playing an instrument.

03:24.871 --> 03:28.341
So that's like being
individually you and that's
good.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.610
- They loved your runway.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.345
They didn't once say they
didn't like your talent.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.214
- They just wish they could see
you more.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.483
- They felt like they wished
that you would let them in.

03:36.483 --> 03:37.384
- Yeah. Well, I mean like,

03:37.384 --> 03:39.920
I would feel really good about
it if like other girls got

03:39.920 --> 03:42.122
like a lot of awful critiques,
but like-

03:42.122 --> 03:44.057
- Shade!
(all laughing)

03:44.057 --> 03:45.158
- Hold up, hold up.

03:45.158 --> 03:48.028
No, but what I mean by that is
like

03:48.028 --> 03:50.063
the only people that really
got negative critiques

03:50.063 --> 03:52.933
was me, Daya, and Deja.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.768
- I do think they're
excited about your drag.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.104
And I think what a great
way to fuckin' start

03:57.104 --> 03:58.605
with that runway look.

03:58.605 --> 04:01.374
I think you just let everyone
know exactly who you are.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.311
- You gave us so much
acting and so many ways

04:04.311 --> 04:06.813
of like moving your head
and lifting your hands.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.715
It was very finessed.

04:08.715 --> 04:12.052
I loved every second of the
runway.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.920
- And they want to see
more of you too, you know?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.222
So that's a good thing, you
know?

04:15.222 --> 04:17.357
they want you to do better
and get better, you know?

04:17.357 --> 04:18.458
- And I want to show them more.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.328
But, you know, fingers crossed.

04:21.328 --> 04:22.262
- How are you feeling?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.064
- Oh my God, not even gonna lie,

04:24.064 --> 04:25.966
I feel on top of the world right
now,

04:25.966 --> 04:29.002
'cause girl, I kid you not, I
was so,

04:29.002 --> 04:32.139
so very nervous because if
I were to fuck up on this,

04:32.139 --> 04:33.940
like, oh my God,

04:33.940 --> 04:35.642
it'll just be so embarrassing
for me.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.178
Because this is what I'm
known back home for doing.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.881
I'm a lip sync assassin I feel
like,

04:40.881 --> 04:43.850
and I don't want to disappoint
nobody.

04:43.850 --> 04:44.918
- And you opened the show.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.254
- Oh my God I know-
- That's a lot of pressure.

04:47.254 --> 04:50.023
- Girl, it was just amazing.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.759
- You looked so fucking
impeccable.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.627
- Thank y'all so much.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.695
And legit, if it wasn't for
y'all and like telling me like,

04:55.695 --> 04:58.131
you're going to be fine. Like-
- Yeah, we got you girl.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.767
- Y'all are my sisters, like.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.636
- Deja. How you feelin'?

05:04.171 --> 05:09.176
- I feel good about what
I presented on the runway.

05:12.412 --> 05:13.813
- You got it babe.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.816
(suspenseful music)

05:21.555 --> 05:25.225
- I feel like the positive
of this experience

05:25.225 --> 05:27.127
has weighed off the negative.

05:27.127 --> 05:31.898
It's just hard to not
think of the negative.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.801
I feel like I had
expectation within myself

05:34.801 --> 05:37.938
and a little bit,

05:38.972 --> 05:41.141
I feel like Ru had an
expectation too.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.377
And I feel like I disappointed
him.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.548
The thing is, is when we
were talking in the workroom,

05:48.548 --> 05:49.616
like he said,

05:49.616 --> 05:52.519
you are exactly what we're
looking for in this competition,

05:52.519 --> 05:54.754
your tape, like for him to view
my tape.

05:54.754 --> 05:55.889
- Hi Deja!

05:55.889 --> 05:57.557
I am so happy you're here.

05:57.557 --> 06:00.927
You know, because your audition
reel was one that I really,

06:00.927 --> 06:02.596
really enjoyed
- Really?

06:02.596 --> 06:05.198
- And I feel like you have the
background

06:05.198 --> 06:07.701
to really excel in this
competition.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.169
- I'm hoping.

06:09.169 --> 06:13.340
- To go from feeling on top of
the world

06:13.340 --> 06:18.178
to feeling like you let down an
idol.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.518
I feel like I dropped the ball

06:25.518 --> 06:28.054
and I have no one to blame but
myself.

06:29.155 --> 06:30.890
I wanted to make sure
that whatever I was doing

06:30.890 --> 06:32.092
was authentically me.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.195
Keep in mind, yes I'm comedic,
but I'm not a comedy queen.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.531
Like I'm on the whim kind of,
yeah yeah.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.100
I'm not a boom, boom, boom,
crash.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.135
- It's your crass like,
attitude and things like that.

06:42.135 --> 06:42.969
Your quick wit.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.704
- Can I say something to you?

06:44.704 --> 06:49.776
I know people are gonna
fall so in love with you.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.678
Can I just be real for you for a
second?

06:51.678 --> 06:53.480
Yes, we want to have
expectations of ourselves.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.981
Yes, it's good to push yourself.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.684
You have to be, I feel
like aware that sometimes

06:57.684 --> 07:00.153
if you have an expectation
of what you're going to do,

07:00.153 --> 07:02.188
you could actually go further
than that

07:02.188 --> 07:04.658
if you don't have that
expectation.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.760
So like, yes, push yourself.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.561
But don't hate on yourself

07:08.561 --> 07:10.063
if you don't meet your
expectation.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.265
Whatever. Next time girl, like.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.602
- Thank you.
- You're gonna be fine.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.437
- So how you feelin' sis?

07:17.437 --> 07:18.738
- I feel like I'm very
self-aware

07:18.738 --> 07:20.340
to the point where it's like
detrimental.

07:20.340 --> 07:25.245
I'm so guarded a lot of the
time and maybe it's ballet,

07:25.245 --> 07:26.146
maybe it's whatever.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.614
I don't know what it is, but
like.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.050
Just this dance thing that I did
today,

07:30.050 --> 07:32.385
I was like gonna go on
I'm, I'm going to show her

07:32.385 --> 07:34.854
all my 5, 6, 7, 8's,
and my pas de bourees.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.489
Forgot they didn't care about
that.

07:36.489 --> 07:37.324
- They don't.
- They wanna see who you are.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.726
- It was so good.
- I'm like, fuck it.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.061
I'm just gonna, you know-

07:41.061 --> 07:43.096
- So clean, you like completely
let go.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.299
And we could all see you having
fun.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.401
I get it, the ballet training.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.302
Absolutely.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.904
- But it's not even just
the ballet training.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.605
There's something protective.

07:52.605 --> 07:56.776
And like, that protection is a
wall.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.278
If I got on a plane tonight,

07:58.278 --> 08:02.649
I would be so upset if I was
just this the whole time.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.284
Cause who cares about that.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.719
- And can I tell you something?

08:05.719 --> 08:06.853
- What?
- Tell her.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.154
- So, when you're talkin about,

08:08.154 --> 08:09.422
imma tell her, but no,

08:09.422 --> 08:12.992
cause I really gravitated
towards you like here.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.129
And I just want you to
know like that wall,

08:16.129 --> 08:19.065
it's gonna have to come down.

08:20.266 --> 08:24.304
Because I promise like, you
stand out just being you.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.338
You really do.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.242
You're unique, but you gotta
be you in order to be unique.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.310
See what I did there.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.912
- Okay hunny!
- Make you laugh girl!

08:32.912 --> 08:36.182
(all laughing and chattering)

08:36.182 --> 08:38.184
From this point on, cause
bitch you ain't going nowhere,

08:38.184 --> 08:40.520
from this point on, I
just need you to be you.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.821
- Someone said to me once,

08:41.821 --> 08:43.823
you talk a lot about your
childhood

08:43.823 --> 08:45.558
being the happiest
place that you remember.

08:45.558 --> 08:48.194
And for me, it was like being in
my room.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.263
I used to draw pictures of
castles,

08:50.263 --> 08:52.966
and I would wear fabric and
dance around my bedroom.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.668
and my dad would go home
and I'd hide that shit.

08:55.668 --> 08:59.139
And she was like, picture
yourself as a kid.

08:59.139 --> 09:02.041
What is the expression on your
face?

09:02.041 --> 09:03.376
And I said, worried.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.277
She was like, why?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.279
And I said I'm like scared
about what people think,

09:06.279 --> 09:07.447
like bullies.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.749
And she's like ask that
kid what they need.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.520
And as the kid, I said,

09:13.520 --> 09:17.557
I just want to know that I
have permission to be who I am.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.458
- Oh my God, yeah.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.362
- Your younger self would be so
proud

09:22.362 --> 09:24.764
looking at you right now.

09:24.764 --> 09:25.765
And I want you to like,

09:25.765 --> 09:27.901
keep that in the back of
your head at all times.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.970
Like we as queer people
go through so much,

09:30.970 --> 09:32.572
especially as kids.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.175
And growing up in general is
fuckin' hard,

09:35.175 --> 09:36.009
you know?

09:36.009 --> 09:39.412
So the person that you
were then as a child

09:39.412 --> 09:41.281
would be so fuckin' proud of
you,

09:41.281 --> 09:42.382
and you need to keep that
in your fuckin' head.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.617
- Because you like finally,
like,

09:44.617 --> 09:46.886
as a kid, like you're,
especially as a gay person

09:46.886 --> 09:48.888
like you always like, oh my God,

09:48.888 --> 09:49.989
I don't even know why
I'm getting emotional.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.791
- No let it out. Don't be
afraid.

09:51.791 --> 09:55.428
- Like, it's so hard as a kid to
like,

09:55.428 --> 09:59.232
not be yourself and like
putting on this like facade.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.268
And then like when you
finally get to be yourself,

10:02.268 --> 10:05.472
it's like a really big
moment in your life.

10:05.472 --> 10:09.476
Growing up I had to fight for
acceptance.

10:09.476 --> 10:12.412
It was always something
I said or something I did

10:12.412 --> 10:14.447
that was too gay or is too
faggy.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.082
And it was never just accepted

10:16.082 --> 10:17.817
for just me having my opinion.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.719
I never in a million years,

10:19.719 --> 10:21.554
like coming from where I came
from,

10:21.554 --> 10:25.859
like ever thought I'd be
able to make this far.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.628
And I have.
- You're here.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.662
- You're here!

10:29.662 --> 10:33.233
- And you know what, we
did it by ourselves. Like-

10:33.233 --> 10:37.103
- Yeah.
- It's from inside, you know?

10:38.104 --> 10:39.772
And I think every single one of
us,

10:39.772 --> 10:42.208
whether we were in the top,
whether we were in the bottom,

10:42.208 --> 10:43.810
whatever the situation is,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.412
we have to remember that
we're here because of us.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.249
And we should be proud of that,
you know,

10:49.249 --> 10:51.317
that is something to be so proud
of.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.153
Cause there's tons of
queer people that aren't,

10:54.153 --> 10:56.523
they are scared to be
themselves.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.957
- Yup.
- So true, yeah.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.693
- Oh my God, I didn't think
today was gonna be so emotional.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.362
- No girl, let it out.
(all laughing)

11:02.362 --> 11:03.263
- And I'm like, I think I'm safe

11:03.263 --> 11:05.365
and I shouldn't be crying that
much.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.035
- I obviously have a
slightly different journey

11:09.035 --> 11:10.603
than some of you.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.873
- Sorry, we're like leaving you
out.

11:13.873 --> 11:14.707
- No, no, no.

11:14.707 --> 11:15.542
- But you have your own journey,

11:15.542 --> 11:16.509
because you have to fight the-

11:16.509 --> 11:18.244
- Like obviously, like I still
felt like,

11:18.244 --> 11:19.612
a little different than
people I grew up with,

11:19.612 --> 11:21.314
but like honestly like doing
drag

11:21.314 --> 11:22.415
and being more part of this,
it's like,

11:22.415 --> 11:25.151
it's opened my eyes up a lot
more to like, the experience.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.053
It was like, you know,
whenever I was in high school,

11:27.053 --> 11:28.555
I thought I was a good ally.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.256
Cause I was like, yeah,
I'm cool with gay people.

11:30.256 --> 11:33.493
But I've learned like so much
more like being part of drag

11:33.493 --> 11:35.762
and like, you know,
like I live in Arkansas.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.830
So like I leave the house in
makeup,

11:37.830 --> 11:41.367
like I peek out the blinds
before I even go to my car,

11:41.367 --> 11:42.302
you know? And it's like,

11:42.302 --> 11:44.170
I get to the club and like I
watch

11:44.170 --> 11:45.705
and make sure no one else
is there before I'm going

11:45.705 --> 11:47.273
from the parking lot to
the club because like,

11:47.273 --> 11:48.608
I'm not queer. I'm not gay.

11:48.608 --> 11:51.678
But I'm still scared of
what might happen to me

11:51.678 --> 11:52.579
because I'm in drag,

11:52.579 --> 11:54.280
because people might perceive me
that way.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.748
Honestly, like doing drag,

11:55.748 --> 11:58.651
I feel has like made me
a lot more knowledgeable

11:58.651 --> 12:01.020
and like a better like
ally for the community.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.023
There's just so many things
I didn't like realize.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.825
- 'Cause you're kind of
in our shoes in a way.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.160
I know you're straight,

12:07.160 --> 12:09.929
however, to the untrained
eye, that doesn't matter.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.365
So you do kind of feel
like the fear we have.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.601
So I think that makes
you understand even more.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.302
- Yeah. A big eye opening thing
for me

12:16.302 --> 12:17.203
was the first time, like,

12:17.203 --> 12:18.871
I went with some friends
to like a pride festival,

12:18.871 --> 12:19.839
you know?

12:19.839 --> 12:22.008
And just like seeing like
so many different people

12:22.008 --> 12:24.043
and like all different walks of
life.

12:24.043 --> 12:24.877
Like, you know,

12:24.877 --> 12:26.379
there's like a million
different ways to be queer.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.413
But then like growing up,

12:27.413 --> 12:29.415
you're taught there's only
one way to be straight.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.283
And that's not the case.

12:30.283 --> 12:34.087
- Preach the motha fuckin'
church girl!

12:34.087 --> 12:36.122
- That is so good!

12:36.122 --> 12:37.890
- People that are like, so like,

12:37.890 --> 12:41.361
intently trying to avoid doing
things that are like feminine

12:41.361 --> 12:42.862
or gay, you know, things like
that.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.564
You're missing out on like half
of like

12:44.564 --> 12:46.032
what life has to offer.

12:46.866 --> 12:47.700
- We're for the gay kids.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.335
But you're for the straight
kids that want to drag,

12:49.335 --> 12:50.336
you know what I mean.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.138
- I will say like, I, I don't,
I don't want to say like,

12:52.138 --> 12:53.773
I'm for the straight people
that want to do drag.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.942
I am for the straight
people that want to step out

12:55.942 --> 12:57.510
of their comfort zone and do
shit

12:57.510 --> 12:59.278
that's not considered straight.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.113
- Yeah.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.482
- Matty, and we're lucky
to have people like you

13:02.482 --> 13:04.250
in our community.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.086
- I am like really privileged
to be able to be a part

13:07.086 --> 13:08.521
of the drag scene and
everything.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.256
But I honestly don't think that
like

13:10.256 --> 13:12.091
a lot of straight people should
do drag.

13:12.091 --> 13:14.427
It's not just like a fun
thing to do with friends.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.195
Like it is a whole community and
like,

13:16.195 --> 13:18.998
if you don't support the art
and the people around it,

13:18.998 --> 13:19.999
and the community around it,

13:19.999 --> 13:21.200
then you shouldn't be doing
drag.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.869
(all chattering)

13:22.869 --> 13:24.370
- Cheers to you, bitch!

13:24.370 --> 13:26.739
- Yeah!
- Cheers to that.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.241
- All right ladies, 5 minutes
filming.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.309
- Oh my God.
- Oh shit!

13:30.309 --> 13:31.611
- Real quick, everyone down the
line,

13:31.611 --> 13:33.312
who do we think is
going to win? Go. Matty.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.349
- I think it's between
you two and Jorgeous.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.283
- Okay Jorgeous go.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.818
- I think it's this bitch.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.221
Cause girl you showed your
personality. They love you
bitch.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.990
They love what you're wearing
and like.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.158
- Out of everyone,

13:45.158 --> 13:48.294
you were the one that
completely showed who you were.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.997
- The mini and the maxi.
- Bitch!

13:50.997 --> 13:53.633
- Yes!
- You better do it bitch!

13:53.633 --> 13:54.934
- Fingers crossed for you baby.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.502
- I don't want to like be the
bitch,

13:56.502 --> 13:58.271
but I have to go put this wig
back on.

13:59.906 --> 14:00.740
- I love you all.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.208
- I gotta get my shoes back on.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.476
- If you do have the lip sync
bitch,

14:03.476 --> 14:04.310
I know you're gonna eat.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.411
- I know I have to lip sync,

14:05.411 --> 14:08.281
but I'm not scared of lip
syncing.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.716
It comes with the territory.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.719
My confidence right now is just
shaken.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.721
But this little stumble,

14:14.721 --> 14:16.355
it doesn't define me in this
competition.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.623
I'm going to fight tooth and
nail,

14:17.623 --> 14:20.727
and show the judges that
I deserve to be here.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.229
- This hair is not the same
as there wore before ladies.

14:23.229 --> 14:24.797
It's okay though, they won't
care.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.332
- Where's the shoes?

14:26.332 --> 14:29.969
- The fact that I'm here
and I am in the bottom,

14:29.969 --> 14:32.004
I'm going to have to lip sync
for my life,

14:32.004 --> 14:35.241
and prove that I deserve to be
here.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.909
It's basically a nightmare to
me.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.611
I'm living a nightmare.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.479
- Sister.
- What's up baby?

14:39.479 --> 14:41.180
- I think it's gonna be you and
me.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.248
- I think so, too.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.283
- Everybody gather your things,
let's go.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.885
Time to re stage.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.153
- Shit.
- Oh shit.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.756
- I love you.
- I love you babe.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.491
I love you so much, okay.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.226
Whoever it is.
- Whatever happens.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.194
- How do I look?

14:56.195 --> 14:57.930
- Ooo!
- Let's hit it!

15:04.137 --> 15:07.340
- Welcome back ladies.
I've made some decisions.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.176
Deja, Daya.

15:10.176 --> 15:13.579
The time has come for you to lip
sync

15:14.714 --> 15:18.651
for your life.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.792
Deja Skye, shante you stay.

15:27.026 --> 15:31.197
Daya Betty, sashay away.

15:36.769 --> 15:41.774
- I am sad that my time
here is ending so soon.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.513
I feel defeated.

15:47.513 --> 15:51.317
I feel like I have let everybody
down.

16:09.635 --> 16:14.740
Definitely feel like
I'm packing up too soon.

16:14.740 --> 16:19.912
But, unfortunately this is a
competition.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.648
So someone has to be in my
shoes.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.887
I'm proud of myself.

16:27.887 --> 16:32.158
Like, only 14 girls got to be
here

16:32.158 --> 16:36.462
and I'm very lucky to be one of
the 14.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.697
It's a great accomplishment.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.432
It's, it's a feat for me.

16:39.432 --> 16:43.035
And, not a lot of people get to
do it.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.937
I don't want to say I'm not as
confident

16:44.937 --> 16:47.173
as I thought walking into the
competition,

16:47.173 --> 16:49.909
but it's definitely is a 180

16:49.909 --> 16:51.510
from where I thought I would be.

17:01.254 --> 17:05.591
I know that this one little peek
of Daya

17:05.591 --> 17:07.460
is not what I have to offer.

17:07.460 --> 17:11.664
For me drag is every face that I
have.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.832
Every feeling,

17:12.832 --> 17:15.735
every emotion that goes through
my head

17:15.735 --> 17:17.336
is who Daya Betty is.

17:17.336 --> 17:19.739
And the judges only saw one part
of that.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.942
And it's hard for me to show the
judges

17:22.942 --> 17:26.112
in one week who Daya Betty is

17:26.112 --> 17:29.015
because I'm a million different
things.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.051
It's a note.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.189
This one says Daya, my baby,

17:38.157 --> 17:42.128
I felt a true connection
with you from the jump.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.497
You're a true star.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.333
Remember this does not
define you and you made it.

17:47.333 --> 17:51.370
The world is yours and
you're going to slay it.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.939
Love you sis, Deja.

17:54.507 --> 17:58.177
I love Deja. She is incredible.

17:59.979 --> 18:04.951
I just like hate this is
what played out for me.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.221
And it's like sad that I'm
going to like miss so much

18:09.221 --> 18:12.758
that they're going to get to
experience together, you know,

18:12.758 --> 18:14.160
cause that's what I
was looking forward to.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.930
But at least I had the
time that I had, so.

18:25.404 --> 18:28.507
Well, it's been short but sweet.

18:36.115 --> 18:41.120
I know that even if you go
home first in this competition,

18:43.122 --> 18:43.956
you've made it.

18:45.024 --> 18:49.795
I definitely see bright
things for me in the future.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.664
You Betty be ready.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.266
I'll see you soon.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.101
Bye!

18:56.502 --> 18:59.105
