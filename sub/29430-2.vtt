WEBVTT

00:05.964 --> 00:07.460
- You like that.
- Oh!

00:07.485 --> 00:08.593
- Yeah!
- That finishes it.

00:08.618 --> 00:09.664
Look at this sink!

00:09.689 --> 00:11.835
- Whoo!
- It's our sink that we installed.

00:11.860 --> 00:13.565
- I...
- We are officially

00:13.590 --> 00:15.116
- fixing this house up.
- ... just want to

00:15.140 --> 00:16.804
wash dishes in this sink.

00:16.829 --> 00:19.080
I want to dry dishes in this sink.

00:19.105 --> 00:21.058
Oh, yeah, don't...
don't be afraid to blast 'em.

00:21.083 --> 00:23.398
My God. When was
the last time you two had sex?

00:23.423 --> 00:25.367
What? That's none of your business.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.329
- We're roommates.
- No, we're not roommates.

00:27.354 --> 00:29.032
- Beau.
- You are temporarily staying here

00:29.057 --> 00:30.798
because you are
separated from your wife.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.448
Whatever it is, I've got a front-row

00:32.473 --> 00:33.612
seat to your marriage,

00:33.637 --> 00:35.120
and I'd like to give you some feedback.

00:35.144 --> 00:36.713
Oh, well, I have some feedback for you.

00:36.738 --> 00:38.299
- We don't want your feedback.
- Yes.

00:38.324 --> 00:40.120
What have you guys been married,
uh, almost two years?

00:40.144 --> 00:41.315
- Two years, yeah.
- Mm.

00:41.340 --> 00:42.377
Honeymoon is over.

00:42.402 --> 00:43.511
Now you're getting to Phase Two.

00:43.535 --> 00:45.494
Really? Uh, how many phases are there?

00:45.519 --> 00:46.533
That's it.

00:46.658 --> 00:47.830
Phase Two, then death.

00:47.855 --> 00:49.877
- Beau, I'm a licensed therapist...
- Mm-hmm.

00:49.902 --> 00:52.955
... and I can assure you
that Mike and I,

00:52.980 --> 00:55.760
we have a communicative,
very healthy relationship.

00:55.785 --> 00:57.760
You two haven't lain
together in three weeks.

00:58.096 --> 00:59.096
You're counting?

00:59.121 --> 01:00.121
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00.146 --> 01:01.166
That's not appropriate.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.692
It's also, like, not accurate.

01:02.717 --> 01:04.799
I just don't want you two to become me.

01:04.824 --> 01:06.510
Staying in your idiot neighbor's house

01:06.535 --> 01:08.536
while all your stuff gets
dropped off on a pallet

01:08.561 --> 01:09.818
in the front yard.

01:16.863 --> 01:18.502
Top of the morning, butthole!

01:18.527 --> 01:19.854
Oh. Okay.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.065
Hey, Mike. Hey, Rio.

01:21.090 --> 01:24.604
That pallet better have
my model train set on it!

01:24.629 --> 01:26.924
And the 19 years I lost!

01:26.949 --> 01:27.955
Beau, Beau, Beau.

01:27.980 --> 01:29.690
Can't imagine why you're separated.

01:29.715 --> 01:33.151
I just don't want this to become that.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.427
This cannot become that.

01:35.452 --> 01:37.244
W... 'Cause we're good.

01:37.269 --> 01:38.283
We're good.

01:38.308 --> 01:40.518
All I'm saying is you're not doing it,

01:40.543 --> 01:42.416
and that can't be okay with both of you.

01:42.610 --> 01:43.815
But what do I know?

01:43.840 --> 01:46.088
Not having sex worked
wonders for my marriage.

01:47.008 --> 01:48.205
Mmm.

Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie

01:58.417 --> 02:01.259
I don't want to let Beau
get inside our head.

02:01.284 --> 02:02.295
- You know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.097
Because he's going through
a really rough time,

02:04.121 --> 02:05.908
he's projecting his pain onto us.

02:05.933 --> 02:07.877
But I think he, uh... He might be right.

02:07.902 --> 02:09.526
I think it's been three weeks.

02:09.551 --> 02:10.634
- Mm.
- Is that right?

02:10.660 --> 02:11.963
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy. I just think

02:11.988 --> 02:13.602
it's impossible to be intimate with

02:13.627 --> 02:15.033
like, Beau hanging around.

02:15.058 --> 02:16.792
- You know?
- Yeah, he's a big part of the problem.

02:16.816 --> 02:19.252
We should tell Beau to
clear out for the night.

02:19.277 --> 02:20.915
Did you just say "part of the problem"?

02:20.940 --> 02:23.041
Oh. Uh, boy, I don't think so.

02:23.066 --> 02:25.096
I... I... I think I said "apart."

02:25.121 --> 02:26.838
Like I hate when we're apart.

02:27.299 --> 02:28.494
- Mm-kay.
- Yeah.

02:28.519 --> 02:29.572
I thought I heard
something different, but...

02:29.596 --> 02:31.283
Hi. Oh, look at you.

02:31.308 --> 02:32.706
- Constance will ring you up.
- Okay.

02:32.730 --> 02:34.541
Oh, to be the buttons
on that cash register,

02:34.566 --> 02:36.065
experiencing your gentle pat.

02:36.090 --> 02:39.698
Vocabulary of a poet and
the mind of a dog.

02:41.718 --> 02:44.095
- Wow.
- They're barking at each other.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.221
Constance!

02:45.246 --> 02:47.541
- Whoa!
- Special delivery!

02:47.566 --> 02:49.954
Yeah, there was a
package outside for you.

02:49.979 --> 02:51.588
- I don't know.
- Oh, uh, wait,

02:51.613 --> 02:52.944
let me film you opening it.

02:52.969 --> 02:54.743
I'm not expecting a delivery.

02:54.768 --> 02:56.182
What is this?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.869
What... What...
What the hell's going on here?

02:58.894 --> 03:00.121
Just open it, just open it.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.330
Okay.

03:03.722 --> 03:06.456
There is nothing in here!

03:08.779 --> 03:10.040
- Surprise!
- Aah!

03:12.372 --> 03:13.407
Ah!

03:13.432 --> 03:14.979
Brandon!

03:16.620 --> 03:17.787
- Ohh!
- What?

03:17.812 --> 03:19.098
- It's Brandon!
- Whoo!

03:20.480 --> 03:22.184
My baby's back!

03:22.940 --> 03:24.687
I was initially supposed
to be in the box,

03:24.712 --> 03:26.504
but then I got claustrophobic.

03:26.505 --> 03:27.783
Oh, just look at you.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.559
- Oh, my God!
- It's like one of those,

03:29.584 --> 03:31.385
like, soldier-coming-home videos,

03:31.410 --> 03:32.869
but it's, like, not a video.

03:32.894 --> 03:35.115
Yeah, it's like the Internet
just came in here,

03:35.139 --> 03:37.612
but even more emotional.

03:37.637 --> 03:39.964
Hey, thanks, everybody, for being here.

03:39.989 --> 03:41.824
Really appreciate it. What's up, Kay?

03:41.849 --> 03:43.198
Same crap, different flies.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.128
- Good to see you, Brandon.
- Where's Beau?

03:45.153 --> 03:46.706
Oh, Mom and Dad are separated.

03:46.731 --> 03:47.857
- Yeah.
- It's an adult issue.

03:47.881 --> 03:49.315
Nothing I said or did caused it,

03:49.340 --> 03:50.881
and there's nothing I
can do to change it.

03:50.905 --> 03:52.379
- Yeah.
- Mom, can I stop filming now?

03:52.403 --> 03:54.134
I think I'm running out
of storage on my phone.

03:54.158 --> 03:55.450
Well, it's 'cause you're
taking so many pictures

03:55.451 --> 03:56.566
of your winky-dinky on there.

03:56.590 --> 03:58.940
- You know it's a shared drive, right?
- What?

03:58.965 --> 04:00.504
- Hey, great seeing you.
- Good to see you.

04:00.528 --> 04:02.042
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.698
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey. Mike.

04:03.723 --> 04:04.870
- I'm Brandon.
- Hi.

04:04.895 --> 04:05.940
- Rio. Hey.
- Oh, wow.

04:05.965 --> 04:07.737
Nice to meet you both. Yeah.

04:07.762 --> 04:08.769
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:08.794 --> 04:10.121
Are you guys just passing through?

04:10.145 --> 04:11.206
You going to Omaha?

04:11.231 --> 04:14.400
Oh, no, we moved here
from New York City,

04:14.425 --> 04:16.065
- from Manhattan, and...
- Yeah.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.583
- we've been living here, yeah,
- We live on, uh

04:17.607 --> 04:19.036
- six or seven months.
- my Aunt Maggie's farm, and

04:19.060 --> 04:20.076
- we're rebuilding it.
- Yeah.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.101
- Oh, amazing.
- It's really great.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.216
How is Maggie?

04:22.241 --> 04:24.716
Oh, uh, she's been better. Um...

04:24.741 --> 04:25.990
- Yeah.
- I don't know why I said that.

04:26.014 --> 04:27.786
- She passed. Her fight is over.
- She died.

04:27.811 --> 04:29.685
Wow. Why didn't you tell me that?

04:29.710 --> 04:32.021
- Uh...
- What else is happening in this town

04:32.046 --> 04:33.786
that you didn't tell me about?

04:33.900 --> 04:35.411
Um...

04:37.229 --> 04:38.646
Nothing comes to mind.

04:40.983 --> 04:43.091
I haven't told Brandon about us yet.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.283
This is all so new,

04:44.308 --> 04:45.896
and I haven't been with another man

04:45.921 --> 04:48.278
since his father, Morris, passed away.

04:48.303 --> 04:49.974
I understand completely.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.341
So, what are you saying?

04:52.366 --> 04:53.614
I'm gonna tell him later.

04:53.639 --> 04:55.302
I find your prudence intoxicating.

04:55.327 --> 04:57.435
Ohh...

04:57.460 --> 05:01.021
So, Beau, you're gonna
sleep in this tent tonight.

05:01.046 --> 05:03.232
Think of it as, like, camping.

05:03.257 --> 05:04.357
I don't want to camp.

05:04.382 --> 05:05.592
What if I have to go to the bathroom?

05:05.616 --> 05:06.990
Well, that's what the bottle's for.

05:07.014 --> 05:08.553
That ought to get you through the night

05:08.577 --> 05:10.638
and, uh, maybe even one
time in the morning.

05:10.663 --> 05:11.663
What?

05:11.688 --> 05:14.075
Oh! I see.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.411
You want some privacy, do ya?

05:15.436 --> 05:17.208
- Yes.
- Yee, doggies!

05:17.233 --> 05:18.528
You know, I see you're really

05:18.553 --> 05:19.857
taking my advice to heart.

05:19.882 --> 05:21.169
- Well, it's...
- You know,

05:21.194 --> 05:22.552
I have lots of thoughts...

05:22.577 --> 05:24.255
Wait, wait, wait. Is that you?

05:24.280 --> 05:26.575
- There he is.
- Look at that mane.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.489
- Like a lion in the jungle.
- Oh, wow.

05:28.514 --> 05:30.685
I used to go through a
bottle of shampoo a week.

05:30.710 --> 05:31.989
So did Kay. Look at that.

05:32.014 --> 05:33.982
- Yep. Bet you two snapped some combs.
- Look at that.

05:34.006 --> 05:36.099
- All right. Well...
- My hair was everything.

05:36.124 --> 05:37.124
Ah, well...

05:37.149 --> 05:38.670
She never forgave me for losing it.

05:38.695 --> 05:39.717
That's not true.

05:39.742 --> 05:41.201
Do you think I'll be alone forever?

05:41.226 --> 05:42.397
- No, no, no, no.
- I don't think that.

05:42.421 --> 05:43.608
- No. Absolutely not.
- You shouldn't... Don't even...

05:43.632 --> 05:44.759
- ... go there.
- You're gonna be fine.

05:44.783 --> 05:45.921
- We'll catch up with you in...
- We'll... Yeah.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.810
- I'm scared.
- You know what?

05:47.835 --> 05:48.960
You're gonna have a
great night tonight...

05:48.984 --> 05:50.030
- Yeah, very safe...
- ... in the tent.

05:50.054 --> 05:51.835
- All-weather tent.
- And it'll be super, super fun.

05:51.859 --> 05:53.849
- What are some of my best qualities?
- Okay.

05:53.874 --> 05:56.053
♪ Happy birthday ♪

05:56.078 --> 05:58.271
Come on, Ma, you know
it's not my birthday.

05:58.296 --> 05:59.865
Oh, I know.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.928
But I wanted to celebrate
all the ones we missed

06:01.953 --> 06:03.170
while you were away.

06:03.195 --> 06:05.662
That's an insane amount of cake,

06:05.687 --> 06:07.857
but I'm down. Let's do it.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.615
Uh, son, I wanted to talk to
you about something.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.639
Man, I can't believe
y'all kept this water bed.

06:16.664 --> 06:18.974
I mean, why did you and Dad
even let me get this thing?

06:18.999 --> 06:20.865
Well, you know your dad and Costco.

06:21.748 --> 06:22.748
Yeah.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.744
I miss him.

06:24.807 --> 06:27.232
Yeah. I do, too.

06:27.257 --> 06:29.068
What did you want to talk to me about?

06:29.093 --> 06:30.568
Well, um...

06:30.857 --> 06:32.304
- I'll get it, Mom.
- Wha... Oh, really?

06:32.328 --> 06:34.592
Yeah. You got the cake. I'll get it.

06:37.152 --> 06:39.112
What's up, Rudy?
What are you doing here?

06:39.375 --> 06:41.623
He came to buy your water bed.

06:42.872 --> 06:45.537
How did you know I was
trying to get rid of the bed?

06:45.562 --> 06:47.232
- Oh.
- You just said so.

06:47.257 --> 06:50.123
So, let the man in so he
can buy your water bed.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.481
I'll pay any price.

06:51.506 --> 06:53.107
I mean, I'll just give it to you.

06:53.132 --> 06:54.529
You do that, and I walk.

06:54.554 --> 06:56.217
No one gives me a bed for free.

06:57.906 --> 06:59.498
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

06:59.523 --> 07:01.646
The house all to ourselves.

07:03.046 --> 07:04.047
- Hello, nobody.
- Are you ready...

07:04.071 --> 07:06.076
Are you ready to do that thang?

07:06.101 --> 07:07.143
Yeah, I am.

07:10.656 --> 07:11.896
- Honey?
- Yeah.

07:11.921 --> 07:13.560
I just want to ask you one question...

07:13.585 --> 07:15.264
Before we... you know?

07:15.289 --> 07:16.581
- Uh-huh.
- Um...

07:16.606 --> 07:18.881
in the store, you know, when you said

07:18.906 --> 07:20.764
that Beau was part of the problem,

07:20.789 --> 07:21.790
can you just explain what you

07:21.814 --> 07:23.266
- meant by that?
- Honey, we don't need to

07:23.290 --> 07:25.071
go over that again.
I mean, it was just nothing.

07:25.095 --> 07:26.579
I was just trying to make conversation.

07:26.603 --> 07:28.313
Oh, you don't have to
get defensive about it.

07:28.337 --> 07:30.234
I... I... This is actually...

07:30.259 --> 07:31.760
This is just like a discussion.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.059
- Oh, okay.
- It's, like, what healthy

07:33.083 --> 07:34.083
couples do, you know?

07:34.108 --> 07:35.512
- Sure.
- They just, like, talk about

07:35.536 --> 07:36.965
- what they're feeling, you know?
- Yeah.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.777
And that's what I wanted
to provide for you.

07:38.802 --> 07:39.802
Just, like, a forum.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.527
Okay. I guess, um...

07:41.552 --> 07:43.097
Well, um...

07:43.573 --> 07:44.847
You know, I guess...

07:45.583 --> 07:47.250
I wish we had more sex.

07:47.275 --> 07:48.636
- I do too.
- Ah.

07:48.661 --> 07:51.316
I want more...
I'm so glad that you said it,

07:51.341 --> 07:52.839
- Yeah.
- because I was like...

07:52.864 --> 07:56.206
I mean, ever since, like,
Beau has been in this house,

07:56.231 --> 07:57.738
- it has been, like...
- Oh, you know,

07:57.763 --> 07:59.589
b-b-but before that.

07:59.789 --> 08:01.183
Oh, before that?

08:01.224 --> 08:02.683
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.043
Are you sort of, like,
pointing the finger

08:04.067 --> 08:05.285
at me a little bit there?

08:05.310 --> 08:07.324
You know what?
I... I think maybe sometimes...

08:07.349 --> 08:08.706
- Sure...
- Um...

08:08.731 --> 08:11.245
You prioritize other things over it.

08:11.270 --> 08:13.097
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I hear you.

08:13.122 --> 08:15.456
I hear those words, and I accept them.

08:15.481 --> 08:17.839
Um, you know,
'cause if we're being honest,

08:17.864 --> 08:19.175
which I think we are,

08:19.200 --> 08:21.652
- in the best of ways right now.
- Oh, you have one, okay.

08:21.677 --> 08:26.503
Um, I would say I'd probably
want to have sex more often,

08:26.528 --> 08:28.933
you know, if it had a little more...

08:29.761 --> 08:30.917
salt n' peppa.

08:30.942 --> 08:31.943
- You know what I'm saying?
- Oh.

08:31.967 --> 08:34.792
You play a lot of the,
like, "greatest hits."

08:34.817 --> 08:36.503
- Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
- Yeah.

08:36.528 --> 08:39.558
When there's not, like,
a lot of new songs.

08:39.582 --> 08:40.792
- Okay. So, yeah.
- Does that...

08:40.816 --> 08:42.823
You're the type of music-goer...

08:42.849 --> 08:45.214
-  Yeah...
- that, when you go see

08:45.239 --> 08:47.105
- The Rolling Stones...
- Okay.

08:47.130 --> 08:49.464
... you want them to stay
away from those hits

08:49.489 --> 08:52.081
and... and hear some of
the solo projects, maybe?

08:52.106 --> 08:53.214
- Yeah.
- Got it.

08:53.239 --> 08:55.550
And that's incredibly
healthy, wonderful.

08:55.575 --> 08:59.453
Like, now that we have this,
like, healthy, open conversation,

08:59.478 --> 09:01.688
I'm feeling really sexual.

09:01.713 --> 09:03.469
I feel informed

09:03.494 --> 09:05.515
and ready to be intimate with you.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.540
Great.

09:06.565 --> 09:07.891
I'm gonna have a little sip of wine.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.047
- Me, too. I would love that.
- Just to wet my whistle.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.491
Very good... good call.

09:11.516 --> 09:13.304
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:13.584 --> 09:15.203
Mm-hmm.

09:18.977 --> 09:20.616
And let's, uh... I'm gonna go like this.

09:20.641 --> 09:21.683
Okay. Oh!

09:23.384 --> 09:25.469
Hello, Mr. Conductor!

09:26.649 --> 09:28.460
Good to see you, too!

09:31.415 --> 09:34.046
Oh, you know what? I think
the ceiling is leaking or something.

09:34.071 --> 09:35.187
Oh, dear. Yeah.

09:35.212 --> 09:36.765
- Oh, I'm feeling water, too.
- Yeah.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.680
- Oh! All right. Yeah.
- That's pretty significant.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.242
Um, actually, we do need to deal
with this right now.

09:40.266 --> 09:41.567
- Legit.
- Okay.

09:41.592 --> 09:43.934
I think we fixed our drip.

09:43.959 --> 09:47.629
Well, thank you so much, Mr. Repairman.

09:49.119 --> 09:52.341
Oh. Yes, yes. I am a repairman.

09:52.366 --> 09:55.458
I mean, how much do I
owe you for all this?

09:55.483 --> 09:57.692
$25,000.

09:57.717 --> 09:59.286
Oh, no.

09:59.311 --> 10:01.989
You pay for the labor, and I'm the best.

10:02.014 --> 10:05.067
Maybe there's some other
way I could compensate you?

10:05.092 --> 10:07.593
What do you have to off...

10:07.618 --> 10:08.618
Ehh.

10:08.643 --> 10:10.700
Yeah, this scenario feels
a little problematic.

10:10.725 --> 10:12.576
It's not in line with the
current awareness, no.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.786
Uhh-la-la-la.

10:13.811 --> 10:17.552
What if we were both
senators with equal pay?

10:17.577 --> 10:18.577
- Yes.
- Ohh.

10:18.602 --> 10:19.809
We have just, like,

10:19.834 --> 10:22.231
the... most equal division of power.

10:22.256 --> 10:23.423
- Yes.
- It's, like, steady.

10:23.448 --> 10:24.802
- Hey, Senator.
- Yeah?

10:24.827 --> 10:25.910
What committees are you on?

10:25.935 --> 10:27.123
I... Um,

10:27.148 --> 10:28.523
I don't really know any committees.

10:28.547 --> 10:29.905
- Uh... Uh...
- Oh, I...

10:29.930 --> 10:33.319
Um, but, I've got the full
weight of my subpoenas...

10:33.344 --> 10:34.623
Very good.

10:34.648 --> 10:35.671
Mm-hmm.

10:36.367 --> 10:37.703
Oh, my God!

10:37.727 --> 10:38.837
- Oh, honey, that's...
- What?

10:38.861 --> 10:40.202
Oh! Uh-oh. Oh, my goodness.

10:40.234 --> 10:41.413
- That's what that is.
- It's running, it's running.

10:41.437 --> 10:42.850
- Uh...
- I am not a plumber,

10:42.875 --> 10:44.436
- but that is bad.
- Yeah.

10:44.461 --> 10:46.077
Let's, uh, deal with that,

10:46.102 --> 10:47.436
but I'm keeping my shirt off,

10:47.461 --> 10:49.187
- 'cause we're staying in the game.
- Keep our head in the game.

10:49.211 --> 10:50.211
Yeah.

10:51.336 --> 10:52.803
Yeah, my back really benefits

10:52.828 --> 10:54.647
from the complete lack of support.

10:54.672 --> 10:56.241
I'm in ecstasy.

10:56.266 --> 10:58.405
Good, 'cause from the look on your face,

10:58.430 --> 11:00.858
I thought you were in excruciating pain.

11:00.883 --> 11:02.124
I'll get the hose.

11:03.501 --> 11:06.202
Okay. I'm on fire for you.

11:06.227 --> 11:08.241
Keeping this a secret has
just made things hotter.

11:08.266 --> 11:09.436
Oh, yeah.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.499
Let's never tell Brandon

11:10.524 --> 11:13.319
so we can keep this
blaze burning forever.

11:13.344 --> 11:14.845
Now, as much as my body wants that,

11:14.870 --> 11:16.413
I think now is the time to be honest.

11:16.438 --> 11:18.694
I... I... I just want to
get you off of this bed.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.463
Give me a good tug
'cause I can't get off.

11:20.488 --> 11:21.924
- Okay.
- Pull me that way. Pull me hard.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.237
You're not pulling.

11:23.261 --> 11:24.298
- Oh. Whoa.
- Hold on.

11:24.323 --> 11:25.567
Let's just get a little motion going

11:25.591 --> 11:27.003
and maybe it'll propel us off.

11:27.028 --> 11:29.331
Yeah, get it going,
get it going, get it...

11:29.356 --> 11:30.558
I think I'm ready to get off.

11:30.583 --> 11:31.816
I'm ready to get off.

11:35.419 --> 11:37.722
Oh. Hi, son.

11:37.747 --> 11:38.830
Hey.

11:38.855 --> 11:40.606
Okay, the Internet says

11:40.631 --> 11:41.902
to locate the leak,

11:41.927 --> 11:44.230
you have to find the
source of the dripping,

11:44.255 --> 11:45.284
so listen.

11:45.309 --> 11:46.832
You know, I'm trying to hear
the drip sounds...

11:46.856 --> 11:48.964
but I'm just hearing
this weird hissing sound.

11:48.989 --> 11:51.020
Honey, I really appreciate you
keeping the vibe going.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.863
But when you do the sexy drip sounds,

11:52.888 --> 11:54.180
I can't hear the actual drips.

11:54.205 --> 11:55.205
Okay, fine.

11:55.230 --> 11:57.183
I'm just, like,
trying to keep the sexy vibe up

11:57.208 --> 11:58.723
because, you know, apparently you have

11:58.747 --> 12:00.261
a ravenous appetite for the flesh.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.293
Okay, well, I'm just saying

12:01.317 --> 12:03.442
you don't have to make the Internet
plumbing instructions sexy.

12:03.466 --> 12:04.716
Mike, I think I do have to,

12:04.741 --> 12:07.995
because on top of moving
across this country

12:08.020 --> 12:09.687
and raising chickens with you

12:09.712 --> 12:11.722
and living in a leaky hovel,

12:11.747 --> 12:14.284
I also have to be a horny plumber

12:14.309 --> 12:16.606
- who was elected to Senate.
- No, no, no, wait, wait, hold on.

12:16.630 --> 12:18.012
You... You...
You wanted to be the Senator.

12:18.036 --> 12:19.828
- I know!
- Y-Y-You told me to mix it up.

12:19.853 --> 12:22.214
Rio, I just...
I don't have a lot of great ideas, okay?

12:22.239 --> 12:23.903
I'm like a...
Just a meat and potatoes guy.

12:23.927 --> 12:25.136
I love meat and potatoes.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.176
I'm all for meat and potatoes.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.645
I was just asking for a
little sauce on the side.

12:27.669 --> 12:29.550
Okay, I would whip you up some new sauce

12:29.575 --> 12:32.028
if you stopped by the restaurant
more than once every three weeks.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.895
What are we even talking about?
I don't even know. This is like...

12:33.919 --> 12:34.919
This is crazy.

12:34.944 --> 12:36.456
Why are we arguing like this?

12:36.481 --> 12:38.175
I think Beau's right. This is it.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.409
We're... We're in Phase Two.

12:39.434 --> 12:41.792
No, Beau is not right.
I will not accept that.

12:41.817 --> 12:43.020
I don't want to be in Phase Two!

12:43.044 --> 12:44.059
You know what? We just need to...

12:44.083 --> 12:45.285
- We need to have sex immediately.
- We have sex immediately.

12:45.309 --> 12:46.309
Whew! Okay.

12:46.334 --> 12:48.058
- Hi.
- Ah, hey.

12:48.083 --> 12:49.778
- Mr. Repairman.
- I don't know if you knew,

12:49.802 --> 12:52.167
but this plumber also
moonlights as a stripper.

12:52.192 --> 12:53.980
- What?
- They call me The Hammer.

12:54.005 --> 12:55.964
- Oh.
- Because I nail everything.

12:55.989 --> 12:58.394
Yeah. Yeah.

13:01.597 --> 13:03.300
- Oh! Geez!
- Honey!

13:03.325 --> 13:05.120
- Oh, my God.
- Hold on. Hold on, I got it.

13:05.145 --> 13:07.083
- I got it.
- Wait, wait. Take... Easy.

13:07.279 --> 13:08.770
I think it's like...

13:08.795 --> 13:09.818
What's this?!

13:09.842 --> 13:11.036
They're snakes!

13:14.788 --> 13:16.654
Lift up my hair!
My hair, my hair, my hair. Okay. Oh.

13:16.678 --> 13:18.115
- No, no. There's none on you.
- Okay.

13:18.139 --> 13:19.357
They're all on the floor.
There's some...

13:19.381 --> 13:20.389
- They're all on the floor.
- Do I have stuff on my...

13:20.413 --> 13:21.850
- Oh, my goodness, look at 'em.
- Ohh, look at it!

13:21.874 --> 13:23.234
It's so bad.

13:24.790 --> 13:26.833
- What's he doing?
- I don't like it.

13:26.858 --> 13:28.231
- Oh.
- Ohh!

13:28.256 --> 13:30.136
- Don't put your hand in there.
- Don't do that.

13:31.020 --> 13:32.479
Nope. It's clean.

13:33.859 --> 13:34.874
There we go.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.959
- Ohh!
- Ho-ho!

13:36.984 --> 13:38.526
Oh, now, stop it. Get back here.

13:38.551 --> 13:39.600
Stay, stay, stay.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.053
- I, uh...
- Beau...

13:41.078 --> 13:42.329
... thought you guys
didn't need my help.

13:42.353 --> 13:45.318
- Well, we do need it.
- Thank you.

13:45.343 --> 13:46.904
Thank you for cleaning up the snakes.

13:46.929 --> 13:48.209
No problem. No worries at all.

13:48.234 --> 13:49.506
I also called you a plumber.

13:49.531 --> 13:50.928
Th... Thank you, actually.

13:50.953 --> 13:52.358
- Hey, little guy.
- Oh, man!

13:52.383 --> 13:53.383
Oh! Oh!

13:53.408 --> 13:55.155
- Why are you putting it in your pocket?
- He's putting it in his pocket.

13:55.179 --> 13:56.179
They're not poisonous.

13:56.212 --> 13:57.332
- It doesn't matter.
- Still!

13:57.356 --> 13:59.873
- Just... It's gonna bite your body.
- What do you know?

13:59.898 --> 14:01.929
You're a couple of dopes who
have snakes in your house.

14:01.953 --> 14:04.038
Now, are you finally ready
to take my marriage advice?

14:04.062 --> 14:05.686
- No, not right now.
- No, thanks.

14:05.711 --> 14:06.773
You just said you wanted my help!

14:06.797 --> 14:08.397
In the snake department.

14:08.422 --> 14:09.733
Marriage is a lot like snakes.

14:09.758 --> 14:11.053
- How, Beau?
- I'll bite.

14:11.078 --> 14:12.079
- What?
- I... I want to see

14:12.103 --> 14:13.998
- how this metaphor ends.
- Oh, yeah?

14:14.023 --> 14:15.023
- Yeah.
- All right, now,

14:15.048 --> 14:16.249
I've been thinking about this a lot,

14:16.273 --> 14:19.162
and I've devised a three-point plan
for a successful marriage.

14:19.187 --> 14:20.811
- Oh, dear.
- Number one...

14:20.836 --> 14:21.959
Always look good.

14:21.984 --> 14:24.170
Rio, never let Mike
see you without makeup.

14:24.195 --> 14:25.249
- I don't wear makeup.
- You should write that down.

14:25.273 --> 14:26.398
- I don't wear makeup.
- You should write that down.

14:26.422 --> 14:27.904
Men are visual creatures.

14:27.929 --> 14:29.522
We like what we see.
Same goes for you.

14:29.547 --> 14:30.715
If you ever start losing your hair

14:30.739 --> 14:32.873
and it comes out in tufts,
get plugs immediately.

14:32.898 --> 14:34.983
If she cannot run her
hand through your mane,

14:35.008 --> 14:36.635
she's gonna run it
through someone else's.

14:36.659 --> 14:38.365
So, visual and tactile.

14:38.390 --> 14:39.734
- Mm-hmm, okay.
- Great. You got it.

14:39.758 --> 14:42.115
Number two, don't be friends.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.177
No.

14:43.202 --> 14:44.779
- O-O-Okay.
- Because when you do,

14:44.804 --> 14:46.115
you forget to be lovers.

14:46.140 --> 14:48.256
- Right? Don't play doorknob
- Mm.

14:48.281 --> 14:49.939
with your spouse,
play it with your buddies.

14:49.963 --> 14:51.611
- Wait, what's "doorknob"?
- You know, doorknob!

14:51.635 --> 14:53.501
Even if you say it louder,
I don't know what doorknob is.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.313
You know, uh, doorknob is when, uh, uh,

14:55.338 --> 14:57.368
you break wind, and you go, "Doorknob!"

14:57.393 --> 14:59.436
And if your...
Your companion doesn't, uh,

14:59.461 --> 15:01.196
touch a doorknob before you do,

15:01.221 --> 15:02.361
then you got to punch them in the arm.

15:02.385 --> 15:03.385
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

15:03.410 --> 15:05.110
And... And you and
Kay were playing that?

15:05.135 --> 15:07.110
- Yeah. Eventually that was the...
- Oh.

15:07.735 --> 15:09.415
only activity we shared.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.024
- Yeah, yeah.
- Number three,

15:11.049 --> 15:12.582
third tip is, uh,

15:12.607 --> 15:14.535
try to figure out
what's going wrong, uh,

15:14.560 --> 15:15.894
before it's too late.

15:15.919 --> 15:17.127
You know, just to circle back,

15:17.152 --> 15:18.457
uh, h-how is it that...

15:18.482 --> 15:20.496
That snakes and marriage are similar?

15:20.851 --> 15:22.355
They're both cold-blooded.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.590
Oh, wow. I thought there would
be a better payout for that.

15:24.614 --> 15:26.582
Hey, Mike? Rio?

15:26.607 --> 15:28.434
- Butthole?
- Sounds like the plumber's here!

15:28.459 --> 15:30.160
- Oh, Kay's the plumber?
- Yeah.

15:30.185 --> 15:31.762
Yeah, she's magic with a wrench.

15:31.787 --> 15:33.356
Hey, that better be a
snake in your pocket.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.480
Oh, yeah, it i... it is.

15:34.505 --> 15:36.871
Mmm, this is so good.

15:36.896 --> 15:39.004
Rudy, it's just delicious.

15:39.029 --> 15:40.035
Thank you, thank you.

15:40.060 --> 15:41.060
So...

15:41.548 --> 15:42.996
How long have you two been dating?

15:43.676 --> 15:44.676
Who?

15:44.732 --> 15:46.059
Uh... M-Me?

15:46.084 --> 15:47.126
What? No.

15:47.151 --> 15:49.020
No. No. N... Him?

15:49.045 --> 15:50.223
I wouldn't... No.

15:50.248 --> 15:52.855
Mnh-mnh. No. Hmm-hmm.

15:54.465 --> 15:56.184
- How'd you know?
- Come on, Ma.

15:56.209 --> 15:59.457
It has been obvious this whole time.

15:59.482 --> 16:01.043
Okay, now that you know what I'm after,

16:01.068 --> 16:02.208
what do you want to do, arm wrestle,

16:02.232 --> 16:04.387
engage in some other contest
of physical dominance?

16:04.412 --> 16:07.289
No. I don't want to do
physical dominance with you.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.027
I'm cool. This is cool.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.168
If you're happy, I'm happy.

16:11.193 --> 16:12.902
Oh, I didn't think I
could get any happier,

16:12.927 --> 16:15.191
but here I am, a fraction happier.

16:15.216 --> 16:17.425
It's nice to do the
whole family thing again.

16:17.450 --> 16:19.527
Yeah. The family thing.

16:19.552 --> 16:21.871
Um, will you excuse me?

16:22.160 --> 16:24.230
- This is good, by the way.
- Thank you.

16:24.262 --> 16:25.846
- What's the secret?
- Cooking it.

16:33.916 --> 16:35.447
Connie.

16:36.541 --> 16:38.377
Are you okay?

16:38.402 --> 16:40.111
Here I thought it was
going to be Brandon

16:40.136 --> 16:41.853
having a tough time,

16:41.878 --> 16:44.005
but Rudy, you were right, it... it's me.

16:44.436 --> 16:45.916
Seeing you with him,

16:45.941 --> 16:48.970
sitting around the table
like we used to with Morris,

16:49.823 --> 16:51.119
that... that's a lot.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.916
If it helps, I'll never sit again.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.588
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

16:55.934 --> 16:59.345
Is it okay if we not do
that family thing just yet?

17:00.807 --> 17:03.986
Is it okay if you just be
my boyfriend for a while?

17:04.011 --> 17:05.385
Boyfriend?

17:05.862 --> 17:07.415
Does that mean we're exclusive?

17:07.441 --> 17:09.605
Yes, and I'm your girlfriend.

17:09.630 --> 17:11.214
You're my girlfriend.

17:12.497 --> 17:13.785
That's fantastic.

17:14.942 --> 17:17.640
Who's your mama? That's right,
Kay's your mama!

17:17.665 --> 17:19.186
Yeah!

17:19.212 --> 17:20.698
I taught him a lesson.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.487
You sure did.

17:22.512 --> 17:23.762
What am I really doing here, Beau?

17:23.787 --> 17:24.892
You know how to fix these pipes.

17:24.915 --> 17:26.486
I mean, compared to you,
I wouldn't know the difference

17:26.510 --> 17:28.240
between a dip tube and a ballcock.

17:28.265 --> 17:30.141
Well, I, uh...

17:31.796 --> 17:33.709
I want to ask you what happened to us.

17:33.734 --> 17:34.741
All right, now, I was...

17:34.766 --> 17:36.328
looking through
the pallet the other day.

17:36.352 --> 17:37.728
And I found this.
Look at that. Look at that.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.405
Oh, my God.

17:39.430 --> 17:41.889
- We were happy.
- Yeah, I love that photo.

17:44.047 --> 17:45.339
That was fun, right?

17:45.364 --> 17:46.606
I mean...

17:47.016 --> 17:49.788
- Was it the hair?
- Beau, I don't care about your hair.

17:49.813 --> 17:52.717
I love that photo because
we were having fun together.

17:52.742 --> 17:54.326
When did that stop?

17:54.369 --> 17:55.913
I guess if I had to pinpoint it,

17:55.938 --> 17:58.733
I would say when I wanted
to go on that cruise

17:58.758 --> 18:00.483
on our sixth anniversary, and you said,

18:00.508 --> 18:02.476
"Why would I want to spend
a bunch of time on a boat

18:02.500 --> 18:03.867
with a bunch of people I don't know,

18:03.891 --> 18:05.702
seeing places I've never been?"

18:05.727 --> 18:06.936
And then we ended up

18:06.961 --> 18:08.962
listening to your police
scanner all night.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.897
- That was fun.
- It was our anniversary.

18:10.922 --> 18:13.020
I know! The guy, uh... he...

18:13.045 --> 18:14.262
He robbed the liquor store.

18:14.287 --> 18:16.205
They found him at his grandma's.

18:16.230 --> 18:18.653
They caught him. They always do.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.551
Yeah, I just wanted our
lives to get bigger,

18:20.576 --> 18:22.465
and you wanted it to stay the same.

18:22.490 --> 18:24.301
Yeah, I...

18:24.719 --> 18:26.668
I... I wanted it to stay the same.

18:26.693 --> 18:29.512
I... I... I was ha... I was happy, so...

18:31.785 --> 18:34.504
Well, I'm sorry I never
told you I wasn't.

18:36.634 --> 18:38.645
Well, I'm sorry I didn't ask.

18:39.148 --> 18:40.690
Thank you.

18:41.096 --> 18:42.872
We shouldn't be listening to this.

18:42.897 --> 18:44.598
No, we probably shouldn't.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.325
Well, these pipes are fixed.

18:46.350 --> 18:48.162
I think the snakes are a
completely separate problem.

18:48.186 --> 18:49.567
They got to find the nest.

18:49.592 --> 18:51.094
- Nest?
- All right, well,

18:51.119 --> 18:52.297
I'm gonna get going.

18:52.322 --> 18:53.930
It was good to see you, sort of.

18:53.955 --> 18:55.149
You too.

18:55.788 --> 18:57.375
- Doorknob!
- What's that?

18:57.408 --> 18:58.408
Ohh!

19:00.822 --> 19:02.094
I guess we are

19:02.119 --> 19:03.995
officially out of the honeymoon phase

19:04.020 --> 19:06.438
and into Phase Two.

19:06.463 --> 19:08.149
I don't think Phase Two's that bad.

19:08.174 --> 19:10.383
No, me neither.
Relationships change, you know?

19:10.408 --> 19:13.016
Like, they're supposed to change, so...

19:13.041 --> 19:16.460
I think the key is letting them change.

19:16.485 --> 19:18.569
I'm excited to go through
all the phases with you.

19:18.594 --> 19:20.750
- Me, too.
- I can't wait for that phase

19:20.775 --> 19:22.943
where we both pick up weird hobbies.

19:22.968 --> 19:24.968
What kind of weird stuff
do you think I'm gonna do?

19:26.184 --> 19:27.446
Full-body spandex.

19:27.471 --> 19:29.696
Wow. You did not hesitate.

19:29.721 --> 19:32.336
- You feel very confident about that.
- Yeah, I feel... well...

19:37.255 --> 19:39.633
You had a little snake
juice on your forehead.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.063
- You know what's crazy?
- Hmm?

19:42.088 --> 19:45.133
Is that when you rubbed that
snake juice off of my head,

19:45.759 --> 19:47.301
it really turned me on.

19:47.326 --> 19:49.079
- Well, Senator, I would...
- What?

19:49.104 --> 19:51.750
... with your permission,
like to introduce

19:51.775 --> 19:53.555
a very big bill to the floor...

19:53.580 --> 19:54.705
Motion granted.

19:54.730 --> 19:55.730
Mm.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.305
What... What the...

19:58.330 --> 19:59.798
You know what?
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

19:59.822 --> 20:02.125
Yeah. It's better if you can't see
the snakes anyways.

20:03.424 --> 20:05.508
Yeah, I have some important
news to share with you.

20:05.533 --> 20:08.071
Constance and I are officially
boyfriend and girlfriend.

20:08.245 --> 20:10.163
I'm her bae now.

20:10.460 --> 20:14.004
Her son Brandon is supportive
of the relationship,

20:14.029 --> 20:15.922
and I hope you will be, too.

20:16.077 --> 20:18.423
You're feeling a lot of emotion
right now, and that's normal.

20:18.447 --> 20:19.946
But would you at least say hello?

20:19.971 --> 20:21.767
When you told me your best friend
might take it hard,

20:21.791 --> 20:23.774
I wasn't expecting a goat.

20:25.518 --> 20:27.485
Now, Theresa, you're being hysterical.

20:27.510 --> 20:29.313
This man was kind enough
to give us his bed.

20:29.338 --> 20:30.506
Thank you for the bed, by the way.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.989
Thanks for making my mom so happy.

20:32.014 --> 20:33.563
It's my honor to know her.

20:34.249 --> 20:35.667
To know both of you.

20:35.738 --> 20:36.985
Yeah.

20:37.568 --> 20:39.196
Bye, Theresa.

20:40.830 --> 20:42.206
She's coming around.

20:43.493 --> 20:46.893
