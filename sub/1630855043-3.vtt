WEBVTT

00:08.356 --> 00:10.053
[tense music]

00:12.447 --> 00:14.188
- Fuck, yeah.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.103
- Hmm.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.844
The cocaine will help
with your exhaustion.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.672
- It already is. Wow.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.370
I feel like a locomotive.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.980
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.983
It's fantastic for surgery.
It's a veritable wonder drug.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.289
- Ah! I'll say.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.986
- And it's totally natural
and harmless.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.162
From a small little plant found
in the South American highlands.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.643
- So, this will keep
me awake? Focused?

00:34.686 --> 00:36.384
- I use it myself,
for long surgeries.

00:36.427 --> 00:39.778
- 'Cause with a murderer on
the loose, I need to stay alert.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.435
- For when you need
a pick-me-up.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.176
- Or you can drink
it if you prefer.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.178
Though it's preferable
to consume it as a tonic,

00:48.222 --> 00:50.006
as it's not very palatable.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.095
[knocking]

00:52.139 --> 00:53.401
Come!

00:55.185 --> 00:56.621
[tense music]

00:56.665 --> 00:58.362
- Sir, there's been
another murder.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.147
- The Widow?
- It looks that way.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.462
The report came from
The Echo Tribune.

01:11.506 --> 01:14.030
- From Enid Jenkins.
- About Enid Jenkins...

01:15.814 --> 01:18.339
- Is something on that dogged
mind of yours, Detective?

01:19.644 --> 01:21.124
- No, sir.

01:21.168 --> 01:24.432
- Son, you couldn't keep
a secret from my blind grandma.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.737
Out with it.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.914
- I warned you that The Widow
would strike again.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.830
- Oh, you warned me, did you?
You got it right, once.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.527
Come back to me when
you've arrested

01:33.571 --> 01:35.791
as many psychopaths as I have.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.314
- Psychopaths...

01:37.358 --> 01:39.098
like Andrew May Sr.?

01:39.142 --> 01:40.883
Because it's looking
an awful lot like you arrested

01:40.926 --> 01:42.102
the wrong man.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.454
- Who the fuck do you
think you are,

01:46.497 --> 01:48.543
questioning my police work?

01:49.848 --> 01:53.591
Andrew May Sr.
was convicted in a court of law.

01:56.594 --> 01:59.119
The evidence I had on that
murderous bastard

01:59.162 --> 02:01.251
was a fuck of a lot more
substantial

02:01.295 --> 02:03.297
than your left-handed,
poem-writing bullshit

02:03.340 --> 02:05.125
you waste your time on.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.519
You can be sure of that.

02:14.438 --> 02:17.572
Back! Outta the way!

02:25.667 --> 02:27.930
- "The five more
who did their part,

02:27.973 --> 02:30.628
Five who stopped
a woman's heart,

02:30.672 --> 02:32.978
Their justice is a blatant lie,

02:33.022 --> 02:36.286
If they don't confess,
the five will die."

02:36.329 --> 02:38.506
[eerie music]

02:52.346 --> 02:56.654
- Jesus... It's the skin
off her back.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.047
[sighs]

02:58.090 --> 03:00.092
[indistinct chatter]

03:03.226 --> 03:06.534
- The message that preceded
this murder,

03:06.577 --> 03:09.972
the one delivered
directly to Enid,

03:10.015 --> 03:12.409
it mentions "a paper's lies."

03:12.453 --> 03:16.370
- So what? Lies sell papers.
People are morbid.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.198
Bloodthirsty. Insatiable.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.156
Show me a rag that doesn't
stretch the truth.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.290
- Of course. But my point
is that The Widow

03:23.333 --> 03:25.988
is communicating directly
with us.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.773
And the common denominator
amongst all these messages

03:28.817 --> 03:30.427
is Margaret Mehar.

03:30.471 --> 03:33.256
So, what lies did Enid
tell about her murder?

03:33.300 --> 03:34.736
- Only Enid knows.

03:34.779 --> 03:37.042
- Sir, if this is what
The Widow will do to someone

03:37.086 --> 03:39.393
who merely printed details
on the case,

03:39.436 --> 03:41.699
imagine what she'll do
to the man who solved it?

03:41.743 --> 03:44.180
- Nah. I was just...
I was just doing my job.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.704
- Sir, this message
speaks about justice.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.577
And you are justice
in this city.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.188
We have to accept the fact
that your life is in danger.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.016
- Do whatever it takes.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.887
All your fancy profile stuff,

03:55.930 --> 03:58.281
I don't care what,
just get me targets.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.891
Guys I can shakedown.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.763
We need this evil creature
locked up

04:01.806 --> 04:03.373
before they can strike again.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.298
[shouting]

04:15.342 --> 04:17.692
- Ms. Verdi, are you awake?

04:17.735 --> 04:18.954
Can you hear me?

04:18.997 --> 04:20.303
[Venetia]: Poor thing.

04:20.346 --> 04:23.088
I cannot believe she would
do this to herself.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.613
Self-flagellation,

04:25.656 --> 04:28.137
all because she was caught alone
with a man in the house.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.834
- A frenzy of religious guilt.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.967
- We could barely stop her.

04:33.403 --> 04:36.972
- It's a good thing you didn't
get hurt in the process.

04:38.756 --> 04:41.368
- What I worry about,
Dr. Israel is...

04:41.411 --> 04:43.326
could this behavior
be indicative

04:43.370 --> 04:45.197
of something much
more concerning?

04:45.241 --> 04:46.938
- Is she mentally ill?

04:46.982 --> 04:48.375
- No.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.768
But what if this Vesuvius
of guilt is because

04:50.812 --> 04:52.727
she invited this man...

04:53.815 --> 04:55.599
into her bed.

04:55.643 --> 04:58.689
- Our dear father,
may God rest his soul,

04:58.733 --> 05:00.996
left us one final request.

05:01.039 --> 05:04.434
To marry our pure sister
to a good husband.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.262
But...

05:06.306 --> 05:08.960
if she were not
quite so pure...

05:09.613 --> 05:12.137
- You can see how
that would prove difficult.

05:12.181 --> 05:14.879
- They check, you know.
In some cultures.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.447
- Can give us the room?

05:18.405 --> 05:21.190
Unconscious or not, your sister
deserves her privacy.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.758
- Oh, yes, 'course.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.630
We're in your debt.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.899
- After seven tours
of five continents,

05:34.943 --> 05:38.207
I can attest that you,
Mrs. Simcoe,

05:38.250 --> 05:41.210
are one of the most powerful
mediums I have ever encountered.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.951
- I am no medium.
I had no control

05:42.994 --> 05:44.256
over what was happening.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.954
- Ah, and this is why
we need each other.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.478
- For all we know,
I was just suffering

05:48.522 --> 05:50.219
from nervous exhaustion.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.394
- No.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.179
I can verify how real it was.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.878
I have devoted my life
to searching the known

05:56.921 --> 05:59.315
and unknown world
for the answers

05:59.359 --> 06:01.622
to the greatest
mysteries of life.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.363
And I think

06:03.406 --> 06:07.192
if you and I were to delve into
this exploration together...

06:07.236 --> 06:08.672
[gasps]

06:08.716 --> 06:13.547
Oh, we might shake this world
to its very foundations.

06:13.590 --> 06:17.159
- No. Communing with my husband
is against nature.

06:17.202 --> 06:20.423
And I can't help but feel
that some of the tragedies

06:20.467 --> 06:22.382
I have faced of late
are because Alistair

06:22.425 --> 06:24.514
veered from the path
of godliness and I followed

06:24.558 --> 06:28.039
right along with this sÃ©ance.
- It is not evil, Mrs. Simcoe.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.129
There is no morality
to the energy

06:31.173 --> 06:32.479
that exists all around us.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.698
- I tell you I reject it!

06:34.742 --> 06:36.526
[door opening]

06:39.355 --> 06:40.443
Detective.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.232
- Has Mr. Rondeau perhaps
outstayed his welcome?

06:47.276 --> 06:49.844
- There is nothing
here amiss, sir.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.108
- Glad to hear it.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.415
However, I have come
on police business.

06:56.198 --> 06:59.244
- Of course.
You must forgive me.

06:59.288 --> 07:02.117
Being in the presence
of this spectral powerhouse

07:02.160 --> 07:04.902
is so intoxicating that I forgot

07:04.946 --> 07:08.689
the horrid malfeasance
you are striving to control.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.344
My good lady.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.521
Sir.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.393
I bid you both, adieu.

07:20.265 --> 07:24.400
[door open and closes]

07:24.444 --> 07:27.142
- That horrid man.

07:27.185 --> 07:30.058
You've rid me of him
for the moment, at least.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.494
Thank you.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.062
- I've come to impose
on your kindness once again.

07:34.105 --> 07:37.239
And to offer an update.
- I heard, yes.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.502
Poor Enid Jenkins.

07:39.546 --> 07:43.506
This... This brutality,
it seems unstoppable.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.813
Tell me you can stop this,
Detective. Please.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.771
Tell me that no one else
will meet the fate

07:47.815 --> 07:50.557
that my Alistair did.
Promise me that you will.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.908
- I swear I will.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.522
- I'm sorry.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.264
I'm terribly sorry.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.222
I... I'm in a state.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.356
- There's nothing
to apologize for.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.663
- I would usually
reach for Alistair.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.233
You're a good man, Detective.

08:18.454 --> 08:21.109
- Would it be possible
to gain access

08:21.152 --> 08:22.893
to your late husband's study,
once again?

08:22.937 --> 08:25.113
- Of course. Come.

08:28.029 --> 08:30.118
[grunting]
- Jesus, it hurts.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.728
It's like pissing
when you've got the clap.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.556
- Really think you need
more of that?

08:33.600 --> 08:36.777
- It's not like I can't sleep,
it's that I won't sleep.

08:36.820 --> 08:40.215
If you had seen what that
maniac did to Enid's back...

08:40.258 --> 08:42.522
Ripped the skin right off.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.480
Her head crushed like a tin can.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.309
- We are going to figure out
who is responsible for this.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.963
- With what?
- These notes she leaves

08:49.006 --> 08:51.095
point the way.
- All those notes only show us

08:51.139 --> 08:53.315
that she's getting closer!

08:53.358 --> 08:55.709
- I think you're doing
too much of that cocaine

08:55.752 --> 08:57.493
Israel has you on.

08:59.713 --> 09:04.718
- I've started looking over
my shoulder, in my own home!

09:04.761 --> 09:06.850
- Maybe if you leveled
things off a bit.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.897
[tense music]

09:12.334 --> 09:15.250
- I wonder what evil she has
in store for me.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.730
[breathing heavily]

09:16.773 --> 09:20.734
Will she rip my teeth out?
Feed them to me?

09:20.777 --> 09:22.823
While fucking me up the ass
with my own severed manhood?

09:22.866 --> 09:24.346
- Get a fucking hold
of yourself!

09:24.389 --> 09:26.914
- How?! With her out
there taunting us!

09:28.655 --> 09:31.005
- The Widow is not some
magic succubus

09:31.048 --> 09:33.224
who suddenly appears
through the ether.

09:33.268 --> 09:36.053
She, or he, is just
a bitter little fuck

09:36.097 --> 09:37.577
who knows what happened
that night.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.709
And since the only people
who do know what happened

09:39.753 --> 09:41.232
are those of us who were there,

09:41.276 --> 09:44.366
we need to figure out
who among us is doing this.

09:46.194 --> 09:49.327
- Okay. Good.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.852
- Eddie!

09:51.895 --> 09:53.549
You keep up the police chase.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.029
I'll sic Eddie on the others
who were present,

09:55.072 --> 09:57.118
see what we can
scare out of them.

09:57.161 --> 10:00.425
Eddie, get your lazy
ass in here!

10:01.688 --> 10:03.254
Eddie!

10:05.169 --> 10:07.215
Where the fuck is he?

10:07.258 --> 10:09.521
[ominous music]

10:17.660 --> 10:19.967
- Hey, the boss wants a word.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.795
[grunting]

10:21.838 --> 10:23.884
[breathing heavily]

10:24.362 --> 10:25.668
[coughing]

10:27.104 --> 10:29.541
- I hear you were
stepping out on me.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.240
Packed a bag, even.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.720
- It's not what it looks like.

10:33.763 --> 10:37.462
- Well, what it looks like
is one of two things.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.942
One...

10:41.336 --> 10:44.121
You're the fucking Widow.
- The Widow?

10:44.165 --> 10:45.688
I've been with you
most of the times

10:45.732 --> 10:47.385
people have been killed.
- Except when you weren't.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.779
Plenty of time
to get up to no good.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.738
- Mr. Garvey,
you know it wasn't me.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.697
- Well, that just leaves
the latter option.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.569
You're a coward
and you're doing a runner.

10:57.613 --> 11:02.183
And Eddie, it's the second one
that really pisses me off.

11:02.226 --> 11:05.012
- She's gonna kill everybody who
was at that party that night.

11:05.055 --> 11:07.014
We can go.
We can move around.

11:07.057 --> 11:10.713
- I'm not running from my city,
from the empire that I built!

11:10.757 --> 11:12.889
- And I'm not dying just because
I was there that night.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.282
I didn't do nothin'!

11:14.325 --> 11:17.677
- You don't get to duck out
on me, motherfucker!

11:18.721 --> 11:21.593
You don't do anything
without checking with me first!

11:21.637 --> 11:23.160
- I fucked up. I fucked up.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.249
- Goddamn right, you fucked up!

11:25.293 --> 11:26.729
- It won't happen again!

11:26.773 --> 11:28.252
[coughing]

11:29.297 --> 11:30.733
[grunting]

11:31.952 --> 11:34.302
[screaming]

11:34.345 --> 11:35.607
What the fuck?

11:35.651 --> 11:37.348
[screaming]

11:37.392 --> 11:38.959
[goat bleating]

11:49.317 --> 11:53.321
- You forget, I own you.

11:54.801 --> 11:58.456
Every last filthy piece of you.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.721
And I will do with you
whatever I want.

12:13.254 --> 12:17.737
- And as the good Lord tells us,
in Proverbs 21:15,

12:17.780 --> 12:21.175
when justice is done,
it brings joy to the righteous,

12:21.218 --> 12:23.264
but terror to evildoers.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.048
[church bells ringing]

12:25.092 --> 12:27.703
A man who strays from
the path of understanding

12:27.747 --> 12:31.054
comes to rest in the company
of the dead,

12:31.098 --> 12:33.143
and the company of the dead...

12:34.841 --> 12:36.451
Sister Mehar.

12:37.626 --> 12:40.324
Welcome back
to the house of God.

12:40.368 --> 12:41.630
We've missed you.

12:41.673 --> 12:44.459
- I haven't been in a church,

12:44.502 --> 12:46.374
any church,

12:46.417 --> 12:48.855
in a long time, Pastor.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.205
- Are you injured?

12:51.248 --> 12:54.121
- Injured? No.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.602
I was assaulted.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.432
And not by a man.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.391
But by two vipers.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.436
I've come to you for help.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.612
Because I cannot stay
in that house.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.397
- Sister Mehar,

13:09.440 --> 13:11.486
it was a miracle
the Botticelli sisters

13:11.529 --> 13:13.183
took you in, given your history.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.577
- They took me in
because of my history.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.840
I'm completely at their mercy,

13:17.884 --> 13:19.450
not that they have any.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.454
And I would rather be back on
the streets working for Horatio.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.630
- You cannot mean that.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.719
- I do, Pastor. I do.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.810
It is an easier life,
as wrong as it is.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.248
So, please, help me.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.815
You must have a spare bed.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.294
- I can barely keep
the orphanage

13:37.338 --> 13:40.167
functioning as it is.
- You take Basil Garvey's money

13:40.210 --> 13:42.169
for the same secret that I know

13:42.212 --> 13:44.649
and yet I receive
nothing but pain.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.043
- Basil Garvey is but
a generous patron

13:47.087 --> 13:48.305
who believes in our ministry.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.394
- Basil Garvey
is the illegitimate son

13:50.438 --> 13:52.614
of cankered whore.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.877
- If you let your tongue
run loose,

13:54.921 --> 13:56.487
he will cut it out.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.321
- Well, all he has to do
is pay me

14:04.365 --> 14:06.846
and I will take his
secret to my grave.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.760
- Margaret...

14:10.110 --> 14:11.894
I have looked out for you

14:11.938 --> 14:15.463
since I saved you from
that den of sin as a child.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.291
Now, you haven't always
listened to me,

14:17.334 --> 14:20.033
but I never gave up on you.

14:20.947 --> 14:24.080
So, please, please...

14:25.560 --> 14:28.693
I beg of you, do not do this.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.304
He's a dangerous man.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.089
Let me get you out of town.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.699
You can start fresh,
somewhere new.

14:34.743 --> 14:38.703
- And do what? With what money?

14:38.747 --> 14:42.316
How can I start fresh
when I have nothing?

14:44.318 --> 14:46.711
Who will hire a woman like me?

14:52.326 --> 14:54.284
- Margaret.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.810
Basil Garvey will send you
to an early grave

14:58.854 --> 15:00.812
rather than pay you a penny.

15:02.466 --> 15:03.903
Margaret!

15:05.034 --> 15:07.297
[tense music]

15:09.299 --> 15:11.084
[birds chirping]

15:19.483 --> 15:21.094
- In the Name of God,

15:21.137 --> 15:23.618
the merciful Father,

15:23.661 --> 15:26.142
we commit the body
of Daisy Zywiecki

15:26.186 --> 15:27.709
to the grave.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.494
From dust you came,

15:30.538 --> 15:33.019
to dust you shall return.

15:33.062 --> 15:36.109
Jesus Christ
is the resurrection

15:36.152 --> 15:38.459
and the life.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.069
Amen.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.333
- Amen.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.206
What a waste.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.556
A tragic waste of a life.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.386
These murders are a scourge.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.738
- These murders are the Lord's
rightful vengeance.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.610
- Daisy was 18.

16:00.437 --> 16:03.005
A simple street walker
trying to get by.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.227
- And she was innocent.

16:07.270 --> 16:12.188
But Horatio, Enid, Alistair?
Sinners, all of them.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.495
Horatio sold that girl.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.584
Alistair paid for her.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.022
- And Enid?

16:20.066 --> 16:22.677
- The forked tongue
of the serpent.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.679
She spread lies.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.637
She no longer can.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.990
- You sound glad that
she was murdered.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.776
- Her lies hanged my father.

16:35.907 --> 16:39.955
Now The Widow is here
to deliver God's holy vengeance,

16:39.999 --> 16:42.914
so I say let the streets run
red with blood.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.613
[ominous music]

16:45.656 --> 16:47.528
[birds chirping]

16:59.148 --> 17:01.368
- What are you hiding from me?

17:04.327 --> 17:06.676
- Do you always
talk to yourself?

17:07.939 --> 17:09.289
- Ha.

17:10.942 --> 17:14.250
Your husband didn't have
photographs by chance?

17:14.294 --> 17:16.557
Oh. Here, let me...

17:17.210 --> 17:18.906
- Always so gallant.

17:25.695 --> 17:27.655
It's going to be hard
for me to look at these.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.831
- I'll be sure to keep
my questions to a minimum.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.102
- Earlier, I know
I was emotional.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.757
- It's only natural.
- But my question stands:

17:42.800 --> 17:45.107
Will you catch this killer?

17:45.151 --> 17:47.066
Will Alistair see the justice
he deserves?

17:47.109 --> 17:50.373
- This killer is two steps,

17:50.417 --> 17:52.854
two very large steps,
ahead of us.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.335
But I will say this:

17:55.378 --> 17:57.511
she or he will make a misstep.

17:57.554 --> 18:00.383
And when they do,
I will be here, waiting.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.517
- Thank you.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.789
- This is from
before I met Alistair.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.312
- Long before.

18:16.356 --> 18:19.141
Twelve years ago, in fact.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.752
A week before
Margaret Mehar's murder.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.676
[Eddie]: I've seen cleaner
chamber pots.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.987
- It's carbolic acid.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.685
And I can assure you,
it is very antiseptic.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.252
Shaving accident?

18:43.296 --> 18:44.862
- You could call it that.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.126
- Sit.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.132
This is going to sting.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.657
[grunting]

19:01.792 --> 19:03.838
- What the fuck was that for?

19:03.881 --> 19:06.841
- You'll thank me when the side
of your head doesn't rot off.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.452
And I'm afraid the pain
is just getting started.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.850
- Enid Jenkins could've used
your skills

19:15.893 --> 19:18.896
when The Widow was removing
the skin from her back.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.985
- Indeed.

19:21.029 --> 19:24.946
Whoever did that knew a thing
or two about human anatomy.

19:26.469 --> 19:27.992
- You know more
than a thing or two.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.081
- I also took an oath.

19:31.561 --> 19:35.130
"I will abstain from all
wrongdoing and harm."

19:35.174 --> 19:37.176
[groaning]

19:45.227 --> 19:47.621
- So you're telling me
I got your word.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.581
You're not the one
taking us out, one by one,

19:51.625 --> 19:53.279
for what happened 12 years ago?

19:57.108 --> 19:58.849
[tense music]

20:02.549 --> 20:04.377
- I heal people, Eddie.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.249
Though sometimes,
healing requires

20:07.293 --> 20:09.120
cutting away that which is...

20:09.904 --> 20:11.427
diseased.

20:24.658 --> 20:27.878
Apply this,
morning and evening,

20:27.922 --> 20:29.924
and keep it covered
with clean fabric

20:29.967 --> 20:31.795
until your wound
is completely healed.

20:33.319 --> 20:37.192
Oh, and, please,
give my best to Basil.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.465
[knocking]

20:49.509 --> 20:50.771
- Sir.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.078
Look at what I found.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.299
Do you recall this night?

20:58.866 --> 21:00.607
- It was at a party. So what?

21:00.650 --> 21:02.173
I can't go to parties now?

21:02.217 --> 21:04.219
I'm not good enough to rub
elbows with the hoity-toity?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.700
- No, sir, that...
that's not what I meant.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.484
Look at who was with you.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.313
- Georges Rondeau.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.359
And?

21:13.402 --> 21:15.274
- Sir, this photo was taken
a week

21:15.317 --> 21:17.276
before Margaret Mehar's murder.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.278
- Georges Rondeau,
he was in town, performing.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.714
I confirmed that
with public records.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.629
But he's never been back.
Until now.

21:22.672 --> 21:25.327
- And these killings only
started upon his return.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.677
- Exactly. Sir, we need
to bring him in for questioning.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.592
- No, we need to put
his head on a spike

21:29.636 --> 21:31.551
and place it
on the city walls.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.857
- First things first.
- Yes, yes, of course.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.382
You splendid, lovely young man.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.907
I've got an eye for talent.
I knew it when I saw you.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.865
You cracked this case.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.433
I know you have!

21:44.477 --> 21:46.696
[laughing]
- Thank you, sir.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.048
[sighing]

21:52.136 --> 21:53.529
- Hmm.

21:53.573 --> 21:54.922
It's fake.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.098
- How can you tell?
- It's too smooth.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.795
There are no imperfections.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.363
Venetia Botticelli,
despite her pretensions,

22:01.407 --> 22:02.843
wears paste.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.366
- Ahh.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.412
She may still prove useful.

22:06.455 --> 22:09.371
Botticelli's a good friend
with Regina Simcoe.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.592
I could convince her to
reevaluate an old devil like me.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.203
- Or you can let go of your
obsession with Regina.

22:15.246 --> 22:18.032
- Oh, the green devil!

22:18.075 --> 22:20.295
You're jealous.
- Jealous I am not.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.775
- Threatened, then.

22:25.561 --> 22:28.172
You have nothing
to be threatened of.

22:29.870 --> 22:32.829
You are essential
to my plans here.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.832
I can't do it without you.

22:36.572 --> 22:39.575
[clapping slowly]

22:44.363 --> 22:46.365
- I came here for a magic show,

22:46.408 --> 22:49.106
but instead I get
this dirty love story.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.152
Brings tears to my eyes.

22:52.632 --> 22:56.026
- My dear, could you run
to the apothecary for me?

22:56.070 --> 22:57.854
I feel a headache coming on.

23:05.209 --> 23:07.951
To what do I owe
this displeasure?

23:07.995 --> 23:10.345
[chuckles]
- You and the fancy way

23:10.389 --> 23:12.042
you talk.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.523
I'm assuming you heard the news
about our friend Enid Jenkins?

23:14.567 --> 23:16.351
- Oh, I'm happy to see
the back of her.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.787
Never did like the woman.

23:17.831 --> 23:20.311
Man. Whatever.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.009
- Enough to kill her?

23:22.052 --> 23:25.447
Alistair. Horatio. Enid.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.231
We're all dropping like flies.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.972
Who's gonna be next?

23:29.625 --> 23:32.411
- Who, indeed? Care to guess?

23:32.454 --> 23:33.934
- You tell me.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.414
It ain't for nothing,
these murders started happening

23:35.457 --> 23:37.328
once your poncy ass
came back to town.

23:37.372 --> 23:38.895
- Ah, my dear man,

23:38.939 --> 23:42.116
I am in the business
of illusion.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.510
[eerie music]

23:52.082 --> 23:53.997
But murder?

23:54.041 --> 23:57.261
Oh, murder is a little
too real and odious

23:57.305 --> 23:59.786
for someone of my refined
constitution.

23:59.829 --> 24:03.006
[laughing]

24:03.050 --> 24:06.183
You're the best all
of Basil's money could buy?

24:07.010 --> 24:09.143
Ugh, you may be an ox
on the outside,

24:09.186 --> 24:12.233
but on the inside,
you're a timid little rabbit.

24:12.276 --> 24:14.496
Too scared to stand up
for anyone.

24:14.540 --> 24:15.932
Including yourself.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.283
- Ah!

24:19.893 --> 24:21.416
[thudding]

24:22.199 --> 24:23.984
[ominous music]

24:28.336 --> 24:29.816
- Put that back in my room

24:29.859 --> 24:32.296
where you snatched it from,
you beast!

24:32.340 --> 24:34.124
You absolute beast of a man!

24:34.168 --> 24:36.170
- Sister, control yourself.

24:36.213 --> 24:39.521
- Control myself? I am being
robbed in broad daylight.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.741
- We suffer now,
so that in the future,

24:41.784 --> 24:43.873
the very near future,

24:43.917 --> 24:46.093
we can return to living
as we once lived.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.703
[sighing]

24:47.747 --> 24:49.749
Focus on the good news.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.402
Verdi is intact.

24:51.446 --> 24:54.928
- I would like to ship Verdi,
in pieces, back to Boston.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.017
- Oh, my dear.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.585
She is worth
far more to us whole.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.503
[tense music]

25:10.770 --> 25:12.685
[grunting]

25:16.819 --> 25:18.038
- Fuck.

25:18.081 --> 25:20.649
[footsteps approaching]

25:20.693 --> 25:22.651
[breathing shakily]

25:29.658 --> 25:31.486
Oh. Detective.

25:32.226 --> 25:33.749
- What happened to you?

25:34.837 --> 25:36.665
- The magician did me wrong.

25:36.709 --> 25:40.060
- He did this to you?
- With his trickery.

25:40.103 --> 25:42.149
Wouldn't happen otherwise.

25:42.192 --> 25:43.585
Untie me.

25:46.196 --> 25:47.720
- Why would he do this to you?

25:47.763 --> 25:49.460
- Boy Georgie didn't like me
sticking my nose in

25:49.504 --> 25:51.593
and asking questions.

25:51.637 --> 25:52.812
- What were you asking?

25:52.855 --> 25:54.814
- How about you untie me?

25:54.857 --> 25:57.207
- Not until
you answer my question.

25:57.251 --> 25:59.775
Look, I'm not stupid,
and you're not a genius.

25:59.819 --> 26:02.038
You and Basil, you think
Georges might be The Widow.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.606
- You don't know that.
- I do.

26:04.650 --> 26:07.914
Which tells me that you both
think you're targets. Why?

26:09.959 --> 26:14.311
We have a picture
of all of you from 12 years ago.

26:15.138 --> 26:17.793
It was taken a week before
Margaret Mehar's murder.

26:17.837 --> 26:20.187
There was Alistair, dead.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.102
Horatio, dead.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.147
And now, Enid.
- So I can't be tied up

26:24.191 --> 26:25.584
like a prize hog for
The Widow to slaughter!

26:25.627 --> 26:28.587
- What was that night?
Why were you all there?

26:28.630 --> 26:31.198
- It was a party
you weren't invited to.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.332
What the fuck are you doing?
- If you're not going to respond

26:35.376 --> 26:37.204
the civil way,
I'll just have to adapt.

26:37.770 --> 26:40.468
- Be warned, Basil Garvey
doesn't take too kindly

26:40.511 --> 26:42.644
to people fucking
with his business.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.080
[spitting]

26:44.907 --> 26:47.040
- And so I need money
and lots of it.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.085
- Well, get out there
and earn it.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.348
Shake your ass if you have to.
You've still got your looks.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.307
- And you've got a fortune.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.050
You're going to give
some of it to me.

26:58.312 --> 27:00.053
[laughing]

27:00.096 --> 27:02.185
You think I'm joking? Pay me,

27:02.229 --> 27:04.666
or the press and all
of your important friends

27:04.710 --> 27:06.276
will know the truth
about your life.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.496
- I'm rich.
I'm a self-made man.

27:08.539 --> 27:11.368
Who cares where I came from?
- Oh, but they will.

27:12.108 --> 27:13.632
Because you were
the pickpocketing

27:13.675 --> 27:14.937
street urchin.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.896
The bastard son of a whore

27:16.939 --> 27:19.725
who spent her days mugging
and her nights fucking

27:19.768 --> 27:22.336
the kinds of people
you socialize with now.

27:23.511 --> 27:27.428
- I think they'd be awed
by all of my accomplishments.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.212
- Then why keep it a secret?

27:31.650 --> 27:34.522
People like you and me,
we're gutter trash to them,

27:34.565 --> 27:36.045
as soon as they know
where we come from.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.699
You may have money now,

27:37.743 --> 27:39.527
but they will stop
talking to you,

27:39.570 --> 27:41.398
stop doing business with you.

27:41.442 --> 27:44.097
They will always choose
one of their own over us.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.839
And everything you've built
will be gone, just like that.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.238
- You're right.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.677
You're right.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.071
And I'll help you.

28:03.290 --> 28:06.249
I should have, a long time ago.
I'm ashamed I didn't.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.599
Street kids like us,

28:08.643 --> 28:10.471
we need to have
each other's backs, right?

28:12.429 --> 28:14.867
- I didn't know what
else to do. I...

28:16.042 --> 28:18.392
The Botticelli sisters
are barbarians.

28:18.435 --> 28:19.959
- Oh, I know.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.265
Hypocrites, the lot of them.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.400
Save your breath, my friend.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.055
Sanctuary is here.

28:31.187 --> 28:34.277
- Pastor May, I told him
I was coming here.

28:36.149 --> 28:39.239
- Good... Good...

28:39.282 --> 28:41.458
I'll confer with him.

28:41.502 --> 28:45.245
In the meantime,
I'm to secure you safe lodging.

28:45.288 --> 28:46.768
The Queen's Chamber.

28:46.812 --> 28:49.597
- That is a place of ill-repute.
- Exactly.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.207
It's the last place
the Botticellis

28:51.251 --> 28:53.253
will think to look for you.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.603
Just a few nights there,
and we'll find you the kind

28:55.646 --> 28:58.737
of room you want,
the kind you deserve.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.569
[tense music]

29:05.613 --> 29:07.571
- And if you won't tell me
what I need to know,

29:07.615 --> 29:09.312
Basil will.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.053
- Good luck with that.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.502
[sinister music]

29:28.462 --> 29:30.986
- Run. Run!
Go, get the fuck out of here!

29:31.030 --> 29:32.379
Get help!

29:51.877 --> 29:54.662
[grunting]

30:06.805 --> 30:08.415
[grunting]

30:08.458 --> 30:10.721
[breathing heavily]

30:23.909 --> 30:25.345
Hey!

30:30.698 --> 30:32.178
Hey!

30:33.875 --> 30:35.616
[distant indistinct chatter]

30:35.659 --> 30:37.618
[panting]

30:38.445 --> 30:40.273
[horse hooves clopping]

30:40.316 --> 30:42.188
[horse neighing]

30:50.674 --> 30:52.154
Shit. Shit.

31:01.598 --> 31:02.643
Ah!

31:04.732 --> 31:06.299
[sinister music]

31:16.352 --> 31:18.137
[grunting]

31:21.836 --> 31:23.882
[door rattling]

31:23.925 --> 31:25.013
Shit!

31:33.935 --> 31:35.284
[grunting]

31:42.248 --> 31:44.293
[grunting]

31:53.999 --> 31:56.262
[coughing]

31:59.482 --> 32:01.789
[panting]

32:09.492 --> 32:11.755
[sinister music]

32:38.043 --> 32:39.783
- And here we are.

32:44.310 --> 32:47.356
- Good evening and welcome,
special people.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.838
- My, I didn't expect
it to be so...

32:50.881 --> 32:53.014
- Gorgeous? I know.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.451
It's a lot for
a first-time visit.

32:55.495 --> 32:56.975
But don't worry.

32:57.018 --> 33:00.587
I've arranged for our most
luxurious room for you,

33:00.630 --> 33:03.372
here in the quiet part
of the building.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.374
- Oh, that sounds very nice.
Thank you.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.854
- Of course.

33:06.897 --> 33:10.901
I'm here to make sure
your evening is a memorable one.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.601
After you.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.300
[tense music]

33:30.617 --> 33:33.141
- Fuck! You let her get away?!

33:33.185 --> 33:35.448
- The Widow has ripped
three men to pieces!

33:35.491 --> 33:38.581
- You didn't see Detective
Whatshisfuck run away from her.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.931
- He told me to get out!
- So you picked up your skirt

33:40.975 --> 33:44.152
and ran, after some fucking
magician got the best of you?

33:44.196 --> 33:47.895
Jesus Christ!
When did you get so soft?

33:47.938 --> 33:50.071
- The detective is on to us.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.855
He has a photograph.

33:51.899 --> 33:54.032
Of the party, all of us,

33:54.075 --> 33:56.860
the dead and, thanks to her,
the about-to-be dead.

33:56.904 --> 33:59.385
But fuck that,
I've paid my dues.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.996
- You fucking coward.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.911
- Excuse me if I see
this shithouse sinking

34:03.954 --> 34:06.305
in a sea of blood
and decide to run for shore.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.829
- It's this kind of cowardice
that has kept you at the bottom.

34:08.871 --> 34:10.873
- Says the guy hiding out
in his fortress with a bunch

34:10.918 --> 34:12.440
of goons protecting him.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.793
- I think...

34:16.837 --> 34:20.841
you've forgotten
how this relationship works.

34:24.105 --> 34:27.500
- You can bluster
and cut into me all you want,

34:27.543 --> 34:31.591
but I'm the one who's out there
protecting you,

34:31.634 --> 34:35.159
putting my life on the line,
and for what?

34:35.203 --> 34:37.684
For some tough-talking
little bitch

34:37.726 --> 34:39.293
whose day in the sun
has long passed.

34:39.338 --> 34:41.295
- Watch your fucking mouth!

34:45.039 --> 34:47.998
- Yeah? Or what?

34:49.217 --> 34:51.437
I hope she saves you for last.

34:53.699 --> 34:56.398
Now the city's gonna see
who the real coward is.

34:57.747 --> 34:59.836
Let's see how tough
you are on your own.

35:05.973 --> 35:09.890
[door opens and closes]

35:09.933 --> 35:11.848
[breathing heavily]
- Mm.

35:19.682 --> 35:22.859
[breathing shakily]

35:29.692 --> 35:31.955
- We'll put you in here tonight

35:31.999 --> 35:34.654
and get you well and rested.

35:37.135 --> 35:41.226
- I, I thought you said I was
to be punished for my sins.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.706
- Oh, we're not monsters.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.100
I can see that you've
learned your lesson.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.190
Heaven waits for you
beyond this door.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.845
Luxury, comfort, splendor.

35:51.888 --> 35:54.587
Puzzle no more
and sleep the sleep of angels.

35:57.111 --> 36:00.723
And heal your beautiful soul.

36:08.688 --> 36:12.170
- Heal your beautiful soul?
- Shush, puss-puss.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.041
You must take your gaze off
the comforts of the moment

36:14.084 --> 36:16.261
and see the great rewards
of our plan.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.133
Our fattened calf needs
her beauty sleep.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.614
- I'll have to burn
all of my pillows.

36:21.657 --> 36:24.225
- Aww, you'll have all
the pillows your plump little

36:24.269 --> 36:25.574
derriere desires,

36:25.618 --> 36:28.229
once we sell her virginity
to the highest bidder.

36:36.368 --> 36:38.239
[insects chirping]

36:40.459 --> 36:42.200
[indistinct chatter]

36:44.158 --> 36:46.552
[footsteps pattering]

36:48.684 --> 36:50.251

37:13.448 --> 37:14.971

[grunting]

39:52.738 --> 39:54.435
[breathing heavily]

39:54.479 --> 39:55.915
- Leave me alone!

39:55.958 --> 39:57.220
I didn't do nothing.

39:57.264 --> 39:59.875
No! No! Please!

39:59.919 --> 40:02.487
No!
[screaming]

40:03.575 --> 40:06.447
No! Let me go, please!

40:07.405 --> 40:09.145
I didn't do anything!

40:09.189 --> 40:10.886
[screaming]

40:18.546 --> 40:20.026
- Jesus!

40:28.817 --> 40:30.993
[distant indistinct chatter]

40:45.051 --> 40:46.792
What the devil?

40:48.358 --> 40:50.317
What are you up to, Georges?

40:51.274 --> 40:53.799
[Eddie screaming]

40:54.756 --> 40:57.542
- Please! Please!

40:59.195 --> 41:01.241
Don't kill me, let me go!

41:01.284 --> 41:03.548
I didn't do anything!

41:03.591 --> 41:04.897
Let me go!

41:05.854 --> 41:07.290
- Let me go

41:07.334 --> 41:09.728
and I'll give you anything,
anything you want.

41:09.771 --> 41:11.686
I will do anything you want.

41:11.730 --> 41:14.167
Just don't let them
kill me, please.

41:14.210 --> 41:17.213
Please! I don't deserve this.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.346
I haven't done anything wrong.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.652
Please.

41:20.695 --> 41:22.567
- Why'd you have to go
and threaten him?

41:23.785 --> 41:25.613
- It was a mistake.

41:25.657 --> 41:27.659
Please, just get me out
of here and I promise

41:27.702 --> 41:29.487
I will disappear into the night.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.140
You will never hear
from me ever again.

41:32.446 --> 41:34.883
Please! Let me go.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.843
Come.
- Eddie?

41:39.801 --> 41:41.629
Our guest appears to be lost.

41:41.673 --> 41:43.326
Please show her
back to her suite.

41:43.370 --> 41:45.372
Our friend Alistair
is waiting for her.

41:45.415 --> 41:47.287
- No. No. Please.
I can't go back in there.

41:47.330 --> 41:48.941
Please!
- Eddie.

41:50.986 --> 41:52.988
Be a good host, now.

41:55.774 --> 41:57.123
- Right, boss.

41:57.166 --> 42:00.474
- No, no! No! No, don't do this!

42:00.518 --> 42:02.563
Please don't send me
back in there!

42:02.607 --> 42:04.783
I won't get back in there. No!

42:04.826 --> 42:08.351
No! No! Don't! Don't!

42:08.395 --> 42:10.832
[screaming]

42:12.051 --> 42:13.835
- Please!

42:13.879 --> 42:15.620
I didn't do anything.

42:15.663 --> 42:18.274
[screaming]

42:18.318 --> 42:19.711
Please!

42:21.974 --> 42:24.585
[screaming]

42:24.629 --> 42:26.805
[groaning]

42:36.118 --> 42:39.034
Please! Don't kill me,
let me go!

42:40.383 --> 42:41.776
Please!
