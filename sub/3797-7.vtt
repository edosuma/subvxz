01:47.454 --> 01:49.571
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.

01:49.622 --> 01:51.073
This is Robert Hodge,

01:51.124 --> 01:53.542
United States Attorney
for the Southern District,

01:53.576 --> 01:56.411
speaking to you here in New York City.

01:56.413 --> 02:00.382
My fellow citizens, we are at war.

02:00.416 --> 02:03.385
Not against a foreign potentate.

02:03.419 --> 02:06.338
Not against a bloodthirsty despot.

02:06.389 --> 02:09.475
We are at war against an army of hoodlums

02:09.508 --> 02:13.595
who have made our streets
unsafe for decent people.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.648
Fear, intimidation,

02:16.683 --> 02:18.934
violence...

02:18.985 --> 02:22.604
these are the tools of
this nefarious scoundrel

02:22.606 --> 02:26.275
known as the modern-day criminal.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.445
From the Lower East Side to Harlem,

02:30.497 --> 02:32.114
Brooklyn to New Jersey,

02:32.116 --> 02:36.285
stretching as far south as Atlantic City.

02:36.287 --> 02:39.121
Bloodshed and mayhem are the currency

02:39.172 --> 02:42.457
of these reprobates,
thugs, and bootleggers...

02:43.877 --> 02:48.847
as they struggle for control
of our nation's streets.

02:50.166 --> 02:53.101
Both Governor Roosevelt
and I remain committed

02:53.136 --> 02:56.471
to this battle, which we must and will win.

02:57.974 --> 03:01.310
Together, with the officers of
Police Commissioner Mulrooney

03:01.361 --> 03:03.478
and District Attorney Crain,

03:03.480 --> 03:06.865
my staff and I are working round the clock

03:06.900 --> 03:09.318
to make certain these cowards

03:09.369 --> 03:10.786
are brought to justice.

03:12.071 --> 03:14.323
I give you my solemn word

03:14.374 --> 03:18.961
that I shall not rest till
every man, woman, and child

03:18.995 --> 03:22.965
can once again safely walk our streets.

03:22.999 --> 03:25.000
This has been Robert Hodge

03:25.051 --> 03:27.669
broadcasting from New York City.

03:42.569 --> 03:44.653
19 men dead between us,

03:44.687 --> 03:46.188
at least a million in lost revenue,

03:46.190 --> 03:47.689
and no goddamn end in sight.

03:47.691 --> 03:49.575
Calm, Mr. Thompson.

03:49.609 --> 03:51.693
Yes, you've been saying that for weeks.

03:51.695 --> 03:55.581
Like all impetuous children,
Luciano will make a mistake.

03:55.615 --> 03:58.367
And while we're waiting,
how are we supposed to eat?

03:58.369 --> 04:01.119
- Hey, Nuck.
- What?

04:01.170 --> 04:02.671
12 of our trucks were firebombed.

04:02.705 --> 04:04.923
Nearly 100 grand up in smoke.

04:07.211 --> 04:09.761
God fucking damn it!

04:10.964 --> 04:14.716
You had mentioned Mr. Capone in Chicago.

04:14.718 --> 04:16.267
Perhaps with additional support...

04:16.302 --> 04:18.887
He's cut me loose. Don't you get it?

04:18.889 --> 04:20.639
We're on our own here.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.858
All that happens, happens as it should.

04:22.892 --> 04:24.359
Then why see a doctor, Sal?

04:24.394 --> 04:26.361
Why get out of the way
of an oncoming train?

04:26.396 --> 04:28.313
Why get out of the
fucking bed in the morning?

04:29.782 --> 04:32.034
I'm counseling restraint.

04:32.068 --> 04:34.152
We are playing a game of chess.

04:34.203 --> 04:37.489
I've played chess and I've never
had an opponent try to kill me.

04:37.573 --> 04:39.291
I'm counseling action.

04:39.325 --> 04:41.994
As in stringing this Luciano
up by his fucking ball sack.

04:42.045 --> 04:45.881
You're tired. Understandably so.

04:45.915 --> 04:48.250
As am I.

04:48.252 --> 04:50.836
I will send more men to guard your trucks.

04:50.887 --> 04:53.422
And in the meantime, if
Luciano shows a hair...

04:53.473 --> 04:55.090
I will cut it.

04:55.092 --> 04:57.509
Along with his fucking throat.

05:01.648 --> 05:03.315
Car's ready, Mr. Maranzano.

05:03.349 --> 05:04.483
Gave it a good scrubbing.

05:04.517 --> 05:06.268
Got the bugs off your windscreen.

05:06.319 --> 05:08.236
Bravo, picciotto.

05:08.271 --> 05:11.440
So we may all see clearly the road ahead.

05:16.863 --> 05:18.330
Tired of waiting on him.

05:18.364 --> 05:21.199
Oh, no, that's okay. My pleasure.

05:21.250 --> 05:24.002
Really, but thank you.

05:29.425 --> 05:31.343
We talked about last night.

05:33.930 --> 05:36.348
Aren't you the kid told me he was hungry?

05:36.382 --> 05:38.517
Doing okay now.

05:40.019 --> 05:42.971
Fill your gut a lot quicker
with this than a shammy.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.807
How's that make you feel?

05:45.809 --> 05:48.060
What are you doing?

05:48.111 --> 05:49.945
It's all hands on deck, ain't it?

05:51.130 --> 05:53.615
You're not part of this, you understand?

05:54.867 --> 05:57.486
Take Archie and Sean, head to New York.

05:57.488 --> 05:58.987
For what?

06:00.823 --> 06:03.992
I could be impetuous myself.

06:29.318 --> 06:32.354
Oh, if it ain't the
macher of Willett Street.

06:32.356 --> 06:33.655
Your husband around?

06:33.689 --> 06:35.857
He went to Aqueduct for the morning.

06:35.859 --> 06:38.693
Then I'll just grab what I came for.

07:39.305 --> 07:40.505
And the book.

07:40.556 --> 07:42.841
I bought the book.

07:42.892 --> 07:44.793
With what?

07:44.827 --> 07:46.178
The money I had.

07:46.229 --> 07:49.297
Where'd you get the money?

07:49.332 --> 07:50.999
You can't prove it.

07:51.033 --> 07:53.685
I don't have to prove it, you do.

07:53.736 --> 07:55.904
That's not how the law works.

07:58.774 --> 08:00.942
Give it to me anyway.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.420
_

08:13.422 --> 08:14.923
You have a library?

08:14.957 --> 08:17.559
- Yes.
- How many books?

08:17.593 --> 08:19.561
Just that one for now.

08:19.595 --> 08:21.596
But it's the proper thing to do.

08:22.798 --> 08:24.933
Who taught you that? Your mother?

08:27.687 --> 08:29.771
Everybody comes from somewhere.

08:29.805 --> 08:31.840
Where do you come from?

08:31.874 --> 08:33.692
From here.

08:34.977 --> 08:37.979
Born here. Family's here.

08:38.014 --> 08:39.865
Where's your family?

08:39.899 --> 08:42.384
It's rude to ask personal questions.

08:42.418 --> 08:45.053
I'm sorry to offend you.

08:45.087 --> 08:47.072
But here's our situation.

08:47.123 --> 08:49.457
- You stole all these things.
- I didn't...

08:49.492 --> 08:51.543
Except for the book.

08:51.577 --> 08:53.795
A legal scholar such as yourself

08:53.829 --> 08:56.631
should know that's called larceny.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.934
You've been sleeping on the boardwalk.

08:58.968 --> 09:00.335
That's vagrancy.

09:00.386 --> 09:02.671
So I could put you in a cell

09:02.722 --> 09:05.891
and you can sit there
until you decide to talk.

09:05.925 --> 09:09.344
Or I could help you.

09:11.614 --> 09:13.915
Why would you do that?

09:13.950 --> 09:17.085
You look like you might need help.

09:21.107 --> 09:23.441
Where are your parents?

09:26.796 --> 09:28.530
Who looks after you?

09:30.132 --> 09:32.834
Where did you learn what's proper?

09:36.038 --> 09:38.690
915 Haddon Avenue.

09:38.724 --> 09:41.209
There's no Haddon Avenue in Atlantic City.

09:41.211 --> 09:43.011
It's in Trenton.

09:43.045 --> 09:44.763
Whose house is that?

09:44.797 --> 09:47.182
Nobody's house.

09:47.216 --> 09:49.384
Is it a school?

09:53.456 --> 09:55.657
Is it an orphanage?

09:57.893 --> 10:00.228
My name is in that book.

10:00.263 --> 10:02.030
If you take it, you're stealing from me

10:02.064 --> 10:04.232
and you're certainly no gentleman.

10:14.076 --> 10:16.461
I need you to pull all
the prostitution cases

10:16.495 --> 10:17.963
north of 110th Street.

10:17.997 --> 10:19.581
You need me to?

10:19.583 --> 10:21.299
Mr. Hodge does.

10:21.334 --> 10:23.084
Right.

10:24.503 --> 10:26.972
I'm sorry, okay? I don't
make the assignments.

10:27.006 --> 10:28.757
Would it be any different if you did?

10:28.808 --> 10:30.175
Yes.

10:30.226 --> 10:32.927
I know you're good at your job.

10:32.929 --> 10:34.763
Mr. Hodge does, too.

10:34.765 --> 10:36.398
It's just...

10:36.432 --> 10:38.933
you have to admit this
is all a little sensitive

10:38.935 --> 10:40.435
given your family background.

10:40.486 --> 10:41.853
Sensitive?

10:41.904 --> 10:44.356
What is that code for?
Thompson can't be trusted?

10:44.407 --> 10:46.908
If anyone felt like that,
you'd have been fired by now.

10:46.942 --> 10:49.577
- Thompson.
- Or never hired in the first place.

10:49.612 --> 10:51.279
Thompson.

10:51.281 --> 10:53.948
- Call for you.
- All right.

10:57.003 --> 10:59.954
Ahem, Thompson.

11:01.290 --> 11:02.674
Hello?

11:02.708 --> 11:05.760
Hey, Willie, it's your father.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.796
Where are you?

11:07.798 --> 11:10.131
I'm in town.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.716
What are you doing?

11:11.767 --> 11:14.352
I just flew into town
and I was wondering if...

11:14.387 --> 11:15.804
No, I can't.

11:15.855 --> 11:17.639
Maybe...

11:17.641 --> 11:19.057
No, I can't.

11:19.108 --> 11:20.859
I understand. I was just thinking...

11:20.893 --> 11:23.028
I...

11:24.113 --> 11:25.447
Not till this evening.

11:25.481 --> 11:28.650
Okay. Okay.

11:33.906 --> 11:35.990
Everything okay?

11:40.162 --> 11:42.497
Let me get you the rest of those files.

11:49.922 --> 11:52.974
It's an orphanage in Trenton.

11:53.008 --> 11:55.977
Doesn't seem to be a telephone.

11:56.011 --> 11:57.429
I can bring her back tomorrow,

11:57.480 --> 11:59.898
but it will be most of
the day coming and going.

11:59.932 --> 12:02.016
Why did she run off?

12:02.018 --> 12:04.119
I couldn't get it out of her.

12:04.153 --> 12:05.854
Sounds rather harsh.

12:05.856 --> 12:09.407
I didn't do anything. I brought her here.

12:11.110 --> 12:13.111
She must have a reason.

12:13.162 --> 12:15.780
Everyone has a reason.

12:15.831 --> 12:17.665
Murderers have reasons.

12:17.700 --> 12:21.252
You said she stole cigarettes.

12:21.287 --> 12:23.588
I just mean you can only
help someone so much.

12:23.622 --> 12:26.374
Who are you trying to persuade?

12:28.294 --> 12:30.311
I'll take her back in the morning.

12:30.346 --> 12:31.963
It's all I can do.

12:32.932 --> 12:34.799
If that's how you see it.

12:34.850 --> 12:36.434
What do you want from me?

12:36.469 --> 12:38.219
What do you want from yourself?

12:38.270 --> 12:39.637
I'm tr...

12:39.688 --> 12:41.940
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

12:43.943 --> 12:46.394
I haven't even had supper yet.

12:53.452 --> 12:55.403
Next time, get here earlier.

12:55.405 --> 12:57.322
You won't have to work so fast.

12:57.373 --> 12:59.040
Then I'd have to talk to you.

12:59.074 --> 13:01.409
Mayn kleyne farbrekher.

13:13.005 --> 13:14.422
- Hey, Talia.
- What?

13:14.473 --> 13:16.307
I think I left my tongue down there.

13:31.073 --> 13:33.441
Ben Siegel. I can't believe it.

13:33.492 --> 13:35.276
Hey, Morris.

13:37.079 --> 13:38.830
What brings you to the neighborhood?

13:38.864 --> 13:42.116
Schnorrer upstairs owes me money.

13:42.168 --> 13:44.786
Feigenbaum? Ah, he's a prick and a half.

13:44.788 --> 13:46.621
I don't name names.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.041
John Hancock for my wife?

13:50.092 --> 13:52.126
Everybody knows who you are.

13:52.128 --> 13:54.512
Sure thing. Clara, right?

13:54.547 --> 13:55.930
Talia.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.849
I'm thinking of my aunt.

13:57.883 --> 14:00.718
My pop, your pop, same
minyan at Bialystoker.

14:00.769 --> 14:02.303
Yeah, he's praying for both of us.

14:02.305 --> 14:03.855
Oh!

14:03.889 --> 14:05.473
Like that joke, right?

14:05.475 --> 14:06.941
Rich man and a poor man.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.060
And they're both davening at the same...

14:10.312 --> 14:12.647
Look who it is. Look, Ben Siegel.

14:12.698 --> 14:14.983
Talk about bad pennies.

14:15.034 --> 14:16.985
Why you got to be like that for?

14:16.987 --> 14:19.320
With you, it's always crepe-hanging.

14:19.322 --> 14:21.406
This is an important person.

14:21.457 --> 14:23.958
And please, put on a dress.
It's the middle of the day.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.126
What are you...

14:31.500 --> 14:33.418
Oh, fuck!

14:33.469 --> 14:35.253
Manténlo vivo.

14:35.304 --> 14:38.223
Manténlo vivo! Alive!

14:38.257 --> 14:39.757
Alive!

14:47.850 --> 14:49.317
Yeah.

14:49.351 --> 14:51.352
What the hell's going on?

14:59.361 --> 15:01.996
Stop shooting, you fucking moron!

15:05.251 --> 15:07.168
It's quitting time, pal.

15:07.202 --> 15:09.370
Now, you and me...

15:09.372 --> 15:11.456
No!

15:12.925 --> 15:15.209
Oh, no. Don't.

15:18.213 --> 15:20.548
You come with me.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.383
I'm dying.

15:22.385 --> 15:24.352
So you're the one sliced off Tonino's ear?

15:24.386 --> 15:26.104
I'm dying.

15:26.138 --> 15:28.556
- That was some loopy shit.
- I'm dying.

15:28.558 --> 15:30.441
- Morris.
- What, do you keep 'em in your dresser?

15:30.476 --> 15:33.144
- Maybe I keep yours.
- Okay! Okay!

15:33.195 --> 15:34.862
- Okay.
- I'm dying, I'm dying.

15:34.897 --> 15:36.364
You're not dying.

15:36.398 --> 15:38.566
Who wants to go on living like this?

15:38.617 --> 15:40.118
Hey, Morris.

15:40.152 --> 15:43.371
Morris, abi gezunt, huh?

15:43.405 --> 15:45.573
Yeah.

15:47.543 --> 15:49.377
Ahem.

15:56.669 --> 15:58.753
What do you think?

15:58.755 --> 16:00.338
Very pretty.

16:00.389 --> 16:02.840
I wasn't quite so tall at her age,

16:02.891 --> 16:04.592
but better than cap and trousers.

16:04.594 --> 16:06.427
Yes, ma'am.

16:06.478 --> 16:08.479
We should get started.

16:08.514 --> 16:10.982
Oh, there's something she'd like to say.

16:11.016 --> 16:13.484
Yes?

16:13.519 --> 16:15.770
I wish to make amends.

16:15.821 --> 16:17.505
I beg your pardon?

16:17.539 --> 16:19.440
For the things I stole.

16:19.442 --> 16:21.826
And how would you do that?

16:21.860 --> 16:23.277
By working.

16:23.279 --> 16:24.946
Working where?

16:24.948 --> 16:26.864
She can help around the house.

16:26.915 --> 16:29.417
And I'll ask at the school.
I'm sure others can use her.

16:29.451 --> 16:31.419
She has to go back to Trenton.

16:32.621 --> 16:34.706
May I speak with you?

16:47.136 --> 16:48.970
You cannot leave her there.

16:48.972 --> 16:50.805
It's where she belongs.

16:50.807 --> 16:53.358
No child belongs there. It's brutish.

16:53.392 --> 16:54.809
You don't know that.

16:54.811 --> 16:57.645
- I know what she told me.
- She ran away.

16:57.696 --> 16:59.280
What do you expect her to say?

16:59.314 --> 17:01.449
That is my point exactly.

17:01.483 --> 17:05.153
She can't stay here.
We don't have the room.

17:05.204 --> 17:07.538
We don't have the money
and we don't have the right.

17:07.573 --> 17:09.156
I will find her a situation.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.626
Girls are always needed.

17:13.712 --> 17:15.997
She has no one.

17:15.999 --> 17:18.165
Children her age are not wanted.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.001
You can't stop every bad thing.

17:20.002 --> 17:22.753
Then why stop an... any of them?

17:25.174 --> 17:27.642
Your desire was to help.

17:27.675 --> 17:30.261
This is what helping means.

17:37.820 --> 17:39.404
Fanelli took a ride by the club.

17:39.438 --> 17:42.607
He didn't see hide nor hair
of Maranzano or his men.

17:42.658 --> 17:45.159
Probably hunkered down in the Bronx.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.495
He's working from his office,
the New York Central Building.

17:47.529 --> 17:49.030
Park Avenue.

17:49.032 --> 17:51.115
So we get one of the
Vanderbilt broads to ice him.

17:51.166 --> 17:54.035
Ahem. Benny's on the
line. Says it's important.

17:54.086 --> 17:56.204
100 bucks says it ain't.

17:58.590 --> 18:01.175
- Where the fuck are you?
- Atlantic City.

18:01.210 --> 18:04.045
- I've been kidnapped.
- God damn it, Benny.

18:04.047 --> 18:05.880
He's in Atlantic City.

18:05.882 --> 18:08.549
- With some skirt?
- Where else?

18:08.551 --> 18:09.884
Listen to me, you fucking numbskull.

18:09.935 --> 18:11.769
- Get your ass back here.
- Fuck you yelling at me for?

18:11.804 --> 18:14.138
I've been snatched, for Christ's
sakes. I'm practically killed.

18:14.189 --> 18:16.057
I don't care how great
a piece of ass she is.

18:16.108 --> 18:18.059
Get on the horn with this yentzer and...

18:20.145 --> 18:21.446
He hung up on me.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.730
Who did?

18:22.781 --> 18:24.115
- Charlie.
- Why?

18:24.149 --> 18:26.234
He's a fucking asshole.
What do you want from me?

18:31.406 --> 18:33.741
Is this for real?

18:33.792 --> 18:35.493
Oh, you want to play games now?

18:35.544 --> 18:37.411
- Don't hang up on me.
- Who's this?

18:37.463 --> 18:40.248
If you want to see your friend again,
you'll listen to me very carefully.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.799
I fucking told you I was kidnapped.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.084
Ah!

18:43.086 --> 18:45.503
Shut you fuck up.

18:45.554 --> 18:47.755
- You there?
- Put him on.

18:47.757 --> 18:49.807
He wants to talk to you.

18:49.842 --> 18:51.809
Hey, Charlie. What's cooking?

18:51.844 --> 18:53.594
- You all right?
- Sure.

18:53.596 --> 18:56.147
They took me to see the
diving horse and everything.

18:56.181 --> 18:57.932
Later on, we're getting cotton candy.

18:57.934 --> 18:59.267
I told you to be careful, didn't I?

18:59.318 --> 19:01.402
I got a bullet in my leg.
You gonna hock me now?

19:01.436 --> 19:03.604
Put Thompson back on.

19:07.609 --> 19:09.777
- I'm here.
- What do you want?

19:09.828 --> 19:12.113
A meeting so we can settle this bullshit.

19:12.164 --> 19:14.615
I'll meet you at your
funeral. We can talk there.

19:14.666 --> 19:16.501
You'll go to Siegel's before mine.

19:16.535 --> 19:20.087
Interesting proposition.
Let me think it over.

19:26.628 --> 19:28.763
You gonna be using that phone again?

19:28.797 --> 19:30.464
Why?

19:30.466 --> 19:32.133
I got to call Esther.

19:32.135 --> 19:34.468
It's Lag BaOmer tonight.
I said I'd be home.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.605
- Someone married you?
- Now you're talking shit about my wife?

19:37.639 --> 19:38.982
Just so happens

19:39.008 --> 19:40.191
I'm gonna be a father in a couple of weeks.

19:40.225 --> 19:42.226
- What's your decision?
- About what?

19:42.277 --> 19:43.528
I take that very seriously.

19:43.562 --> 19:46.564
- Margaret?
- Sure, I cat around.

19:46.615 --> 19:48.733
But a good woman waiting
for me? Never forget it.

19:48.784 --> 19:51.118
- Is something going on?
- Rehearsing an act downstairs.

19:51.153 --> 19:54.539
So any of you momzers rats me out
about being at that gash's apartment...

19:54.573 --> 19:56.574
- You wanted confirmation.
- Hold on.

19:56.625 --> 20:00.127
I swear to God, I'll pop a slug so
far up your ass, your back teeth...

20:06.001 --> 20:07.251
Say it again.

20:07.302 --> 20:09.921
You've shorted 50,000 shares

20:09.972 --> 20:11.923
of the Mayflower Grain Corporation.

20:11.974 --> 20:14.091
Short another 50,000 in the morning.

20:14.142 --> 20:16.310
You're being awfully curt.

20:16.345 --> 20:19.313
Sorry. Please short another 50,000.

20:19.348 --> 20:22.149
- It's a big position.
- Meaning?

20:22.184 --> 20:23.818
The market will notice.

20:23.852 --> 20:25.853
That's the point.

20:25.904 --> 20:27.188
Come on, get him up.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.190
- You have anything squirreled away?
- A bit.

20:29.192 --> 20:31.108
Well, take a short position yourself.

20:31.159 --> 20:33.361
I'll make my own decisions,
if you don't mind.

20:33.412 --> 20:36.197
Of course you should. Just trying to help.

20:36.248 --> 20:38.616
I appreciate your
concern for my well-being.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.701
But since I don't know
what it is you're trying...

20:40.703 --> 20:43.588
I have to go. They're rehearsing again.

21:17.623 --> 21:19.824
Not even a handshake.

21:21.994 --> 21:24.161
What are you doing here?

21:25.797 --> 21:26.998
Passing through.

21:27.049 --> 21:28.666
To where?

21:30.085 --> 21:33.137
You talk to your mother?

21:33.171 --> 21:35.256
Yes.

21:36.925 --> 21:38.426
What she say?

21:39.761 --> 21:42.263
She saw you in Chicago.

21:43.265 --> 21:44.982
A good visit.

21:45.851 --> 21:47.568
I screwed up, Will.

21:47.602 --> 21:49.603
- Pop.
- Got in over my head.

21:49.605 --> 21:51.693
- Pop.
- Can I... I just want you...

21:51.695 --> 21:53.051
- Pop!
- I want you to know.

21:53.075 --> 21:56.994
Look, whatever it is, I can't hear it.

21:58.948 --> 22:00.831
You understand?

22:00.866 --> 22:03.668
Yeah, of course I do.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.088
Nobody needs the grief.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.128
Where are you staying?

22:14.179 --> 22:16.514
Doesn't matter.

22:17.966 --> 22:20.134
Look, I...

22:23.722 --> 22:26.640
455 West 93rd.

22:26.692 --> 22:28.943
5D. Wait for me.

22:30.812 --> 22:33.564
Clean yourself up, get something to eat.

22:33.615 --> 22:35.783
And I'll...

22:35.817 --> 22:37.985
we'll sort it out.

22:39.571 --> 22:41.322
Take it.

22:42.407 --> 22:44.208
Take it.

22:45.293 --> 22:46.911
You want money?

22:49.581 --> 22:51.716
What is it you want?

22:53.335 --> 22:55.302
I told myself...

22:57.339 --> 23:01.592
if he's doing okay, then it was worth it.

23:03.311 --> 23:05.813
And here you are.

23:06.848 --> 23:09.100
Right side of the street.

23:12.738 --> 23:14.488
That's all.

23:19.911 --> 23:21.579
Pop.

23:24.499 --> 23:26.584
Pop, come on now.

23:40.632 --> 23:42.550
What are you doing? Get off of me.

23:42.634 --> 23:44.935
- Be quiet.
- Pop!

23:44.970 --> 23:47.555
Let go! Pop!

23:47.557 --> 23:51.058
- That's my son!
- Pop!

23:51.060 --> 23:53.861
- That's my son!
- Got in the car and took off.

23:56.715 --> 24:00.234
"One never knows the capacity
of an ordinary hand satchel

24:00.285 --> 24:03.237
until dire necessity compels the exercise

24:03.239 --> 24:05.956
of all one's ingenuity to reduce everything

24:05.991 --> 24:08.909
to the smallest possible compass.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.580
In mine, I was able to
pack two travelling caps,

24:12.582 --> 24:14.715
three veils, a pair of slippers,

24:14.749 --> 24:17.251
a complete outfit of toilet articles,

24:17.302 --> 24:20.621
inkstand, pens, pencils, and copy paper,

24:20.655 --> 24:23.641
needles and thread, a dressing gown..."

24:26.645 --> 24:30.347
Yes, a hand satchel.

24:33.101 --> 24:35.653
Don't take me back.

24:37.189 --> 24:38.906
Who's going to look after you?

24:38.940 --> 24:41.025
I'll look after myself.

24:42.244 --> 24:44.328
You can't live out of a satchel.

24:44.362 --> 24:47.114
- Nellie did.
- Until she came home.

24:47.149 --> 24:51.202
She had to come home
whether she liked it or not.

24:57.425 --> 24:59.793
I could help Mrs. Thompson

24:59.845 --> 25:01.529
when her time comes.

25:01.563 --> 25:03.130
That's months away.

25:03.132 --> 25:04.548
She's scared.

25:04.599 --> 25:07.852
- What?
- She's scared of something.

25:09.187 --> 25:10.771
She told you that?

25:10.805 --> 25:12.573
You can see it.

25:14.209 --> 25:16.861
Please. Let me stay.

25:16.895 --> 25:18.529
What do you mean?

25:18.563 --> 25:20.781
They lock you in a room.

25:20.815 --> 25:23.284
They don't give you food or water.

25:23.318 --> 25:25.402
They tell you you're born in sin,

25:25.453 --> 25:29.073
that your whole life is a sin.

25:29.124 --> 25:31.592
You can never wash it away.

25:31.626 --> 25:34.078
I didn't do anything.

25:34.129 --> 25:36.163
I didn't...

25:40.101 --> 25:43.254
She sailed around the whole world.

25:50.178 --> 25:52.263
All right, now.

25:52.314 --> 25:53.981
All right.

26:08.863 --> 26:10.331
Can you come with me?

26:10.365 --> 26:12.917
- What for?
- You're needed.

26:12.951 --> 26:14.368
Don't worry about the uniform.

26:14.419 --> 26:16.287
Good evening, Sheriff Lindsay.

26:16.338 --> 26:18.038
Good evening, Mrs. Thompson.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.624
Have you come to steal my husband away?

26:20.675 --> 26:23.043
Just some county business.

26:25.013 --> 26:26.647
I'll tend to her.

26:26.681 --> 26:28.549
Her niece.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.884
She's visiting from Camden.

26:31.886 --> 26:34.271

29:22.056 --> 29:24.057
Meyer Suchowlansky.

29:24.059 --> 29:27.027
Sometimes known as Michael Lewis.

29:27.061 --> 29:30.063
You have a brother Jacob.

29:35.620 --> 29:37.704
Who am I?

29:37.739 --> 29:40.073
You're...

29:40.125 --> 29:42.576
Benjamin Siegelbaum. Shortened to Siegel.

29:42.578 --> 29:45.412
Two out of three, huh?

29:45.414 --> 29:47.748
Sorry, Pink.

29:47.799 --> 29:51.969
Benny... Benny's not here right now.

29:53.087 --> 29:55.339
What else do you know about us?

29:56.424 --> 29:58.091
You, uh...

29:58.143 --> 30:00.477
you've been criminal
associates since childhood.

30:00.512 --> 30:03.897
He's a lieutenant of Salvatore Maranzano.

30:03.932 --> 30:08.101
And whatever happens to me,

30:08.103 --> 30:10.270
sooner or later,

30:10.321 --> 30:12.940
you're all going to jail.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.442
Why is that?

30:15.444 --> 30:17.661
Because the United States
Attorney for the Southern District

30:17.695 --> 30:19.496
has staked his career on it.

30:19.531 --> 30:21.949
Sounds serious.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.618
Well, this is more like a family matter.

30:25.870 --> 30:28.622
- What?
- He's the nephew, right?

30:28.673 --> 30:30.841
That's the dope from the inside.

30:30.875 --> 30:34.161
There's something I want you to understand.

30:34.195 --> 30:36.046
I got no beef with you.

30:36.097 --> 30:38.182
But like you said...

30:38.216 --> 30:40.968
Friends since childhood.

30:40.970 --> 30:43.470
So whatever your uncle does to Benny,

30:43.521 --> 30:45.906
that's got to reflect on you.

30:45.940 --> 30:49.443
I got nothing to do
with my uncle's business.

30:49.477 --> 30:52.779
I'm an assistant United States
Attorney in the office of...

31:13.334 --> 31:15.669
We'll go over your job
history a little bit later.

31:15.671 --> 31:18.722
All right? Enough, Pink.

31:25.313 --> 31:28.682
- Yes?
- You and your boss have crossed the line.

31:28.733 --> 31:31.768
I'm my own boss, Mr. Thompson.

31:33.922 --> 31:36.073
Put him on now.

31:48.953 --> 31:50.787
We get your attention?

31:50.838 --> 31:53.507
Let me talk to my nephew,
make sure he's okay.

31:54.959 --> 31:56.960
You want to talk, fine.

31:57.879 --> 31:59.630
But we'll do it in person.

32:03.768 --> 32:06.770
He was putting up the Corner Hotel.

32:08.306 --> 32:11.224
Never knew where he
got the money, you know.

32:12.860 --> 32:15.395
I was just a joiner's apprentice.

32:17.231 --> 32:21.068
But for some reason, he
saw me as a reliable man.

32:22.403 --> 32:26.239
So I did one thing for him.

32:28.326 --> 32:30.794
And then another.

32:33.798 --> 32:36.300
Then I put on a badge.

32:39.253 --> 32:42.506
Look what he's built for himself now.

32:44.258 --> 32:46.476
What's the task at hand?

32:48.313 --> 32:50.480
You said you wanted to help.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.651
Here is opportunity.

32:56.437 --> 32:58.488
Go on.

32:58.523 --> 33:00.190
Aren't you coming?

33:00.241 --> 33:02.275
I believe I'm done.

33:06.164 --> 33:08.198
Mr. Lindsay?

33:11.953 --> 33:14.121
Mr. Lindsay.

33:58.883 --> 34:01.334
Where did the sheriff go?

34:01.386 --> 34:03.837
He was feeling poorly, sir.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.007
Vague answer.

34:08.059 --> 34:10.594
It's all I know, Mr. Whitlock.

34:20.021 --> 34:22.355
This is a private concern.

34:22.407 --> 34:25.826
It goes without saying that
discretion is paramount.

34:29.447 --> 34:31.248
Wait here.

34:43.210 --> 34:44.628
What happened to Lindsay?

34:44.679 --> 34:46.463
He left matters to me.

34:46.514 --> 34:49.014
I'd counsel we address that later.

34:53.855 --> 34:55.772
Leander will instruct you.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.559
Conduct yourself with honor and...

35:00.611 --> 35:02.229
we'll discuss what happens next.

35:02.231 --> 35:03.730
Yes, sir, Commodore.

35:03.732 --> 35:05.899
Yes, sir.

35:05.950 --> 35:08.535
Always a good boy.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.469
The Commodore believes in
the virtue of charitable acts.

35:25.503 --> 35:28.421
Some of these acts are
demonstrated in public,

35:28.473 --> 35:30.891
some are not.

35:30.925 --> 35:34.144
To offer opportunity to the poor
and beleaguered youth of the county,

35:34.178 --> 35:37.130
he enlists such as he can in service

35:37.165 --> 35:41.201
with an eye towards schooling
them in the useful domestic arts.

35:41.235 --> 35:44.604
But not all children prove suitable.

35:44.606 --> 35:48.241
And there is a limit to
how much they may be helped.

35:57.118 --> 35:59.252
You will bring her to this address.

36:00.454 --> 36:02.372
You will make clear to the mother

36:02.423 --> 36:05.525
that no further compensation
will be forthcoming

36:05.560 --> 36:10.063
and no further inquiry will be brooked.

36:11.632 --> 36:14.134
Are you capable of that?

36:52.340 --> 36:54.591
What the fuck they waiting for?

36:56.344 --> 36:59.479
So take off if that's what you want.

37:02.650 --> 37:04.851
What do I get for sticking around?

37:04.902 --> 37:07.153
What do you have in mind?

37:07.188 --> 37:09.105
The club,

37:09.156 --> 37:11.024
clear title.

37:11.026 --> 37:13.076
5% of everything else.

37:15.329 --> 37:16.613
All right.

37:16.664 --> 37:19.032
I didn't think you'd say yes.

37:20.284 --> 37:22.535
Caught me in a good mood.

37:22.537 --> 37:24.204
Hmm.

37:30.511 --> 37:32.545
You have a gun?

37:34.131 --> 37:35.548
I need to know.

37:35.550 --> 37:37.634
This has to stay controlled.

37:39.353 --> 37:41.137
I don't even have cigarettes.

37:59.123 --> 38:01.491
Nothing without my say-so.

38:22.596 --> 38:24.180
We need to see him.

38:24.231 --> 38:25.765
Same here.

38:38.279 --> 38:39.863
You all right, Will?

38:39.914 --> 38:42.198
Been better.

38:45.703 --> 38:47.754
Take the gag off.

38:55.129 --> 38:58.214
Khamoyer. Vos Makhstu?

38:58.265 --> 39:01.217
Get me the fuck out of this, huh?

39:01.268 --> 39:03.286
Why we came, Benny.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.690
Guns down, make the exchange.

39:31.832 --> 39:34.250
Hey, let go of me!

39:35.636 --> 39:38.004
Wait! Hold it! Hold it! Nobody...

39:38.006 --> 39:40.390
Fuck you! Fuck you, Thompson!

39:40.424 --> 39:42.726
- Eli, you're gonna get us all killed.
- I don't give a fuck!

39:42.760 --> 39:44.594
Lick the piss off my shvantz,

39:44.645 --> 39:46.813
- you piece of Jersey shit.
- I'll fix it.

39:46.847 --> 39:48.598
- You like that, cocksucker?
- All right?

39:48.649 --> 39:51.684
- I don't care!
- I'll fix it.

39:51.736 --> 39:55.105
We'll fucking bury you!
Your whole fucking family!

40:01.829 --> 40:03.329
We had an agreement.

40:03.364 --> 40:04.914
Name somebody you ain't fucked over.

40:04.949 --> 40:07.200
- Teaching me a lesson?
- This is business.

40:07.202 --> 40:09.669
And I want all of yours,
down to the last pasty

40:09.703 --> 40:11.755
in that rat-ass strip joint you run.

40:11.789 --> 40:14.874
And Cuba. Whatever you got down there.

40:14.925 --> 40:18.044
- What then?
- Decide that later.

40:18.046 --> 40:20.430
- Hey, Charlie.
- Mickey.

40:20.464 --> 40:22.348
I just... something to consider.

40:22.383 --> 40:24.717
- Mickey.
- We all swim in the same waters.

40:24.719 --> 40:27.353
Whatever beef you two got,

40:27.388 --> 40:30.440
I've been running that
place the last seven years.

40:30.474 --> 40:31.891
You don't need to be
throwing the baby out...

40:31.893 --> 40:33.393
Shut the fuck up for once.

40:33.395 --> 40:34.861
Look out!

40:34.895 --> 40:37.230
You son of a bitch!

40:37.232 --> 40:39.149
- Hold on! Stop!
- Puta!

40:39.200 --> 40:41.067
Put them down!

40:41.069 --> 40:43.787
- Stop! Everybody stop!
- Stay calm!

40:43.821 --> 40:46.539
You fuck!

40:53.631 --> 40:55.748
It's yours.

40:55.750 --> 40:59.302
Everything's yours. Let him go.

40:59.336 --> 41:00.587
What's everything?

41:00.589 --> 41:02.422
What I have.

41:02.424 --> 41:05.975
All I've ever had. Atlantic City.

41:10.064 --> 41:12.816
What do you think?

41:12.850 --> 41:16.019
I think I'd like to see him on his knees.

41:18.022 --> 41:20.356
Make my friend happy.

41:41.512 --> 41:44.380
Now you know how it feels.

41:46.967 --> 41:50.436
I underestimated you, Charles.

41:50.471 --> 41:52.438
That was a mistake.

41:52.473 --> 41:54.974
You're much smarter than
I gave you credit for.

41:55.025 --> 41:56.860
And what's that make you?

42:06.453 --> 42:08.021
Dumber than I knew.

42:08.055 --> 42:10.740
Good words for the headstone.

42:17.081 --> 42:19.415
I'm giving you what you want.

42:19.466 --> 42:21.968
- Let him go.
- Ah, just fucking kill him.

42:22.002 --> 42:24.170
Kill him, kill the kid, kill 'em all.

42:24.172 --> 42:26.172
Grab it anyway.

42:26.174 --> 42:28.675
Mouths of babes.

42:28.677 --> 42:30.426
That won't solve your problem.

42:30.477 --> 42:32.345
- And what problem's that?
- Maranzano.

42:32.347 --> 42:36.099
- I'll get to him.
- Unless he gets to you first.

42:36.150 --> 42:40.153
Don't say it doesn't worry
you. It's all you think about.

42:41.739 --> 42:44.357
24 hours,

42:44.359 --> 42:46.242
I take care of it.

42:46.277 --> 42:48.494
I take the risk

42:48.529 --> 42:50.530
and you let him go.

43:08.682 --> 43:11.351
- Hey, jerk-off.
- What?

43:11.385 --> 43:13.937
Let's get steak and eggs.

43:18.359 --> 43:20.526
Get him in the car.

43:29.737 --> 43:32.538
You deliver and we deliver.

43:48.756 --> 43:50.723
What'd you just do?

43:50.758 --> 43:52.809
I don't know.

44:02.569 --> 44:05.605
Capone made over a million
between '25 and '29.

44:05.607 --> 44:06.906
Failed to report a nickel.

44:06.940 --> 44:09.942
22 counts of willful
evasion of income taxes.

44:09.994 --> 44:12.362
Bootlegging, gambling, extortion...

44:12.413 --> 44:13.780
that money is all taxable.

44:13.782 --> 44:16.449
Specific violations of
the Revenue Act of 1926.

44:16.451 --> 44:18.451
Tell me about these ledger books.

44:18.453 --> 44:20.536
Profits, losses, expenses

44:20.587 --> 44:22.121
all laid out in black and white.

44:22.172 --> 44:24.457
With a witness willing to testify.

44:24.508 --> 44:26.142
We're ready to move on him, sir.

44:26.176 --> 44:28.094
We can trace the money.

44:30.931 --> 44:33.433
We can prove the crimes.

44:33.467 --> 44:35.635
And we can put this crook in jail.

44:37.137 --> 44:39.605
Gentlemen...

44:39.640 --> 44:41.391
you've got your warrant.

44:51.568 --> 44:52.985
Bureau of Internal Revenue.

44:53.037 --> 44:55.488
We have a subpoena for
Mr. Salvatore Maranzano.

45:16.176 --> 45:19.896
Aiut... aiuta...

45:19.930 --> 45:22.815
Aiutami!

45:22.850 --> 45:24.934
Merda...

46:40.929 --> 46:43.012
Where the heck have you been?

46:45.232 --> 46:47.767
Maybe I shouldn't ask.

46:47.818 --> 46:50.069
That'd be a good idea.

46:50.103 --> 46:51.654
Well, get cleaned up.

46:51.688 --> 46:53.940
Hodge is on his way and
he's loaded for bear.

46:53.942 --> 46:55.191
What's going on?

46:55.242 --> 46:57.944
Cripes, did you even see daylight?

46:57.946 --> 47:00.163
Salvatore Maranzano was murdered

47:00.197 --> 47:02.665
this afternoon in his office.

47:05.953 --> 47:07.253
Couldn't have gone cleaner.

47:07.287 --> 47:09.005
In and out, five minutes.

47:09.039 --> 47:10.673
All people saw were hats.

47:10.707 --> 47:13.676
Any problems, we have
our friend on the inside.

47:17.297 --> 47:19.131
What else?

47:20.601 --> 47:22.552
Atlantic City.

47:23.604 --> 47:25.688
Give it to Pinky.

47:25.722 --> 47:28.191
That's a big bar mitzvah present.

47:28.225 --> 47:30.026
Somebody's got to run that shithole.

47:30.060 --> 47:32.812
Something more important.

47:32.814 --> 47:34.814
We got to set this meeting.

47:34.816 --> 47:37.333
Sooner is better.

47:37.367 --> 47:40.152
Everyone from Pittsburgh to Podunk.

47:40.204 --> 47:42.822
Lay out the rules before
people get their own ideas.

47:42.873 --> 47:45.124
Now, I can make these phone calls.

47:45.158 --> 47:47.326
That'll be the easiest.

47:47.361 --> 47:51.714
Most of these guys, we all
cut our teeth on Mulberry Bend.

47:51.748 --> 47:53.249
So when they hear it from me...

47:53.300 --> 47:55.218
We're gonna handle it, Johnny.

47:57.638 --> 48:00.256
These are big changes.

48:00.307 --> 48:02.341
I want to be sure everything goes...

48:02.392 --> 48:05.511
We appreciate all your advice.

48:05.546 --> 48:07.763
Couldn't have done it without you.

48:08.849 --> 48:11.901
Jesus, look at you alter kockers.

48:11.935 --> 48:13.819
We celebrating or not?

48:18.659 --> 48:20.776
This could be a good year, Charlie.

48:20.827 --> 48:22.194
So what are you waiting for?

48:22.246 --> 48:24.080
Let's pop those bottles already.

48:24.114 --> 48:26.365
Let's get this thing going.

48:27.367 --> 48:29.752
Whoo!

48:29.786 --> 48:31.120
Ha ha!

48:31.171 --> 48:32.838
Whoo!

48:34.007 --> 48:36.175
Here you go. Let's cut a rug.

48:40.048 --> 48:41.797
Who is it?

48:41.848 --> 48:44.050
Joe Harper.

48:44.968 --> 48:47.053
It's unlocked.

48:55.112 --> 48:58.531
Thought you might want
it cleaned up in here.

48:58.565 --> 49:00.700
Not right now.

49:04.905 --> 49:07.573
You want refills on those?

49:08.825 --> 49:11.210
Just clear the empties.

49:14.081 --> 49:15.798
All the booze, out.

49:29.146 --> 49:31.314
Do you know what happened?

49:35.502 --> 49:36.869
You won.

49:36.903 --> 49:40.272
Mickey, Arquimedes,

49:40.274 --> 49:42.108
they're not coming back.

49:42.142 --> 49:43.776
Understand?

49:45.412 --> 49:48.748
What's it like when you see it?

49:51.251 --> 49:53.319
You tell yourself it's quick.

49:53.353 --> 49:56.122
But you don't know.

49:56.124 --> 49:59.792
You can't know until it's you.

49:59.843 --> 50:02.128
And then you'll never tell anyone.

50:04.715 --> 50:07.383
Is the club staying open?

50:09.136 --> 50:11.604
Ask the new boss.

50:14.808 --> 50:17.476
You know, there's things I can do for you.

50:19.479 --> 50:21.197
Sure.

50:21.231 --> 50:23.549
You can sweep the sand.

50:23.583 --> 50:25.201
Sorry?

50:35.162 --> 50:37.997
That's 1,000. Maybe more.

50:38.048 --> 50:41.884
Go be a plumber or a bookkeeper

50:41.918 --> 50:44.804
or the president.

50:44.838 --> 50:46.305
Sir?

50:47.758 --> 50:49.408
Just take the money.

50:50.727 --> 50:52.344
Take it.

50:55.098 --> 50:57.683
Then do whatever you want, you stupid hick.

50:57.734 --> 50:59.602
But do us both a favor

50:59.653 --> 51:02.455
and get the fuck away from me.

51:58.829 --> 52:00.546
I'm sorry.

52:00.580 --> 52:03.215
Business took longer than I expected.

52:06.119 --> 52:08.554
It's my job.

52:08.588 --> 52:11.640
I don't have a choice. You know that.

52:13.844 --> 52:15.845
Mabel?

52:15.896 --> 52:17.680
What did you say to her?

52:17.714 --> 52:19.165
What?

52:19.199 --> 52:20.649
What did you say?

52:20.684 --> 52:23.569
- Nothing. What...
- She's run off.

52:23.603 --> 52:24.987
When?

52:25.021 --> 52:26.438
I was asleep.

52:26.490 --> 52:28.657
She take anything?

52:28.692 --> 52:30.476
- I don't know.
- Did you look?

52:30.510 --> 52:32.278
Why would you even ask me that?

52:32.280 --> 52:34.163
Because she's a thief.

52:34.197 --> 52:36.415
She is a thief. That's what she is.

52:36.449 --> 52:38.284
She was someone who needed help.

52:38.335 --> 52:41.787
I tried. I tried.

52:43.256 --> 52:44.957
I care about you.

52:44.959 --> 52:47.459
I care about the family
we're going to have together.

52:47.511 --> 52:49.195
That's all that matters to me.

52:49.229 --> 52:51.463
You can't fix everything.

52:53.467 --> 52:56.435
Come back.

52:56.469 --> 52:58.554
Please come back.

53:02.526 --> 53:05.611
What is it you expect me to be?

53:30.420 --> 53:33.138
"Dear Sheriff Enoch.

53:33.173 --> 53:36.058
You came to my aid once

53:36.092 --> 53:39.144
a very long time ago.

53:39.179 --> 53:42.181
I write in the last
hope that you can find it

53:42.232 --> 53:45.484
in your heart to think of me once again.

53:46.853 --> 53:50.322
As a child, and for most
of my life thereafter,

53:50.357 --> 53:54.076
I only did what I had to do to survive,

53:54.110 --> 53:55.995
making a devil's bargain

53:56.029 --> 53:59.531
and in the process giving birth to a child

53:59.533 --> 54:03.168
fathered by a man I did not love.

54:03.203 --> 54:05.204
With no hope of reprieve

54:05.206 --> 54:09.208
and with everything in
this world taken from me,

54:09.259 --> 54:13.045
for the past seven years
I have been held captive.

54:13.096 --> 54:15.414
I feel as if I am in hell,

54:15.448 --> 54:17.466
which is a pain worse than death.

54:17.517 --> 54:19.385
Taken away one piece at a time.

54:19.436 --> 54:21.770
You are the only one left who knows me.

54:21.805 --> 54:23.389
Please tell them who I was before.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.890
You promised not to return me

54:24.892 --> 54:26.892
to a place determined to crush my soul.

54:26.894 --> 54:28.560
Show me the same kindness now

54:28.562 --> 54:31.063
that you once showed an orphan
girl under the boardwalk.

54:31.114 --> 54:33.148
I know in your way you
thought you could save me.

54:33.199 --> 54:35.901
Would it have been better
for both of us if you had not?

54:35.952 --> 54:37.369
We were innocent once.

54:37.404 --> 54:40.306
Every moment here is a
torture I cannot describe.

54:40.340 --> 54:42.825
As a girl and for most
of my life thereafter,

54:42.876 --> 54:44.627
I did what I had to do to survive.

54:44.661 --> 54:46.495
I do not look for
absolution, but only relief.

54:46.546 --> 54:49.915
I gave birth to a son fathered
by a man I did not love.

54:49.966 --> 54:52.468
Everything in this world
has been taken from me.

54:52.502 --> 54:54.586
With no hope of reprieve.

54:54.638 --> 54:56.305
I go back over what I have just written.

54:56.339 --> 54:59.758
I look at the words and
think they make sense.

54:59.760 --> 55:03.312
And with each passing day
I am less and less certain.

55:04.431 --> 55:05.848
Bit by bit,

55:05.899 --> 55:07.933
they take you away until all you are...

55:07.935 --> 55:10.269
I tell myself I am sane.

55:10.320 --> 55:11.904
...and finally nothing at all.

55:11.938 --> 55:14.690
If you would come, if
you would sit beside me...

55:14.741 --> 55:16.575
You are the only one left who knows me.

55:16.609 --> 55:19.611
Show me the same kindness now that
you once showed an orphan girl.

55:19.613 --> 55:21.780
There is forgiveness for everyone.

55:21.782 --> 55:23.699
I turn to you on my knees.

55:23.750 --> 55:25.367
I beg you."

55:30.590 --> 55:32.958
Please help me.
